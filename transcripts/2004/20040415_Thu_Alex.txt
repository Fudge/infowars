[00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:06.161]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:07.881]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.601 --> 00:00:09.761]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.362 --> 00:00:11.182]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.922 --> 00:00:12.862]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.482 --> 00:00:17.203]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.663 --> 00:00:21.804]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.864 --> 00:00:23.224]  Music
[00:00:31.716 --> 00:00:33.157]  Hello, my friends.
[00:00:33.277 --> 00:00:37.700]  Here we are on another live edition of this global transmission against tyranny.
[00:00:40.502 --> 00:00:43.284]  It's Thursday, the 15th day.
[00:00:43.305 --> 00:00:48.248]  That's Thursday, the 15th day of April 2004.
[00:00:48.288 --> 00:00:50.650]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.430]  Well, Mr. CIA Bin Laden...
[00:00:58.575 --> 00:00:59.315]  He offered a truce to Europe.
[00:01:26.112 --> 00:01:31.276]  Three Japanese hostages in Iraq released into Japan's hands.
[00:01:32.517 --> 00:01:34.579]  Hijackers fly into the Pentagon.
[00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:44.387]  No chance, said top Pentagon brass just five weeks before 9-11 as they were running drills of that scenario actually happening.
[00:01:45.308 --> 00:01:47.830]  So we'll go over this London Guardian article.
[00:01:48.511 --> 00:01:51.253]  RFID presses into service for roadways.
[00:01:52.153 --> 00:01:56.902]  The government and vendors are investigating technology called dedicated short-range communications.
[00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:57.949]  We're good to go.
[00:02:24.036 --> 00:02:32.478]  Shows an old man at his self-checkout lane, U-scan, being tracked, where, of course, the biometric scanners are going in as well.
[00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:40.080]  Italian hostages executed in Iraq, or hostages executed in Iraq on tape.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.221]  Italy says, though, they're not going to pull out.
[00:02:42.281 --> 00:02:45.482]  They vow to stay in Iraq despite the hostage killing.
[00:02:46.495 --> 00:02:54.220]  Also, Army lengthens Iraq tours despite the pledge that the troops who've already been there over a year would be coming home.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:02.566]  They're going to add another 80,000, and the call for the draft is being sounded again, and the legislation is pending on the edge of being passed.
[00:03:03.606 --> 00:03:05.267]  Iraqi beaten to death by U.S.
[00:03:05.327 --> 00:03:05.628]  troops.
[00:03:05.648 --> 00:03:07.369]  We'll get into that as well.
[00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:11.191]  Three Japanese hostages in Iraq released into Japan's hands.
[00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:12.092]  That's good news.
[00:03:13.341 --> 00:03:16.263]  So, again, we'll go over all of this and more.
[00:03:16.443 --> 00:03:19.645]  UK government wants cameras in every residential neighborhood.
[00:03:19.665 --> 00:03:21.406]  At least they announced it there.
[00:03:21.466 --> 00:03:24.047]  It's going in here in every neighborhood to watch you and your family.
[00:03:24.067 --> 00:03:31.612]  New evidence indicates and indicts FBI complicity in Waco massacre and...
[00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:40.791]  WorldNet Daily wrote an article and used exact quotes from our interview with the Verichip supplier a couple weeks ago.
[00:03:40.831 --> 00:03:43.711]  They wrote an article yesterday about it and didn't really give us credit.
[00:03:43.731 --> 00:03:47.452]  They said an American talk show, which I don't really care.
[00:03:47.472 --> 00:03:51.793]  It's just that Sherry Gossett wrote the article.
[00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:52.953]  We've interviewed her before.
[00:03:52.973 --> 00:03:54.953]  I wanted to go over this WorldNet Daily article.
[00:03:55.314 --> 00:03:57.214]  They have our quote that we got from...
[00:03:58.251 --> 00:04:05.194]  The Baja Beach Club manager, who's a Verichips distributor, about how you'll have to have it for a global ID system.
[00:04:06.494 --> 00:04:08.035]  I'm glad they picked up on that, though.
[00:04:08.715 --> 00:04:10.076]  And I called them up this morning.
[00:04:10.116 --> 00:04:13.257]  They said, yes, Mr. Jones, we'll give you credit for that.
[00:04:13.297 --> 00:04:14.278]  So that's good.
[00:04:14.298 --> 00:04:16.418]  But I'm just glad that they're doing some real reporting.
[00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.450]  We're certainly happy that they're doing that as well.
[00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.391]  So a huge show broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:04:25.891 --> 00:04:34.994]  The websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com and there's another movie.
[00:04:35.394 --> 00:04:38.495]  A listener called about this a few months ago and lo and behold it's true.
[00:04:38.915 --> 00:04:47.397]  The Long Kiss Goodnight with Samuel Jackson and Gina Davis where a
[00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.904]  Quasi-government group is bombing government buildings as a pretext for war, and, well, we're going to air this.
[00:04:54.984 --> 00:04:57.970]  It goes hand-in-glove with the Lone Gunman episode, so stay with us.
[00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.552]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.993]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.414 --> 00:05:13.636]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.876 --> 00:05:20.900]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:27.384]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.544 --> 00:05:28.745]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:28.945 --> 00:05:29.426]  We're good to go.
[00:05:29.466 --> 00:05:29.946]  We're good to go.
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:49.023]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.

[00:05:50.324 --> 00:05:50.524]  Call today.
[00:06:01.681 --> 00:06:09.071]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:06:09.331 --> 00:06:14.077]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:06:14.297 --> 00:06:19.945]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:06:20.185 --> 00:06:24.709]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[00:06:24.929 --> 00:06:32.075]  The cashless society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[00:06:32.095 --> 00:06:36.639]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.322]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masses of terror.
[00:06:39.542 --> 00:06:46.268]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying our constitutional republic.

[00:07:00.658 --> 00:07:11.410]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:19.178]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:22.542]  Harmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:07:22.822 --> 00:07:23.964]  The water level is always visible.
[00:07:41.385 --> 00:07:47.328]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:07:47.548 --> 00:07:51.810]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:53.491]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.021]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.681 --> 00:08:11.482]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.242 --> 00:08:14.163]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:14.183 --> 00:08:17.425]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:18.006 --> 00:08:22.108]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:31.634]  All right, we're now 8 minutes and 30 seconds into hour number one.
[00:08:33.223 --> 00:08:39.287]  Ben Laden, again, that means the CIA is wanting a truce right now.
[00:08:39.307 --> 00:08:51.014]  I mean, all the government's got to do is go to a chat room and say, I'm Ben Laden, and then basically scare us into submission.
[00:08:52.423 --> 00:08:57.569]  You know, they tried fat men in dark rooms saying that they were responsible for 9-11.
[00:08:57.749 --> 00:09:04.416]  Everybody looked at the fat guy with the nose twice the size of bin Laden's and said, that isn't Osama bin Laden.
[00:09:04.436 --> 00:09:14.367]  Then they had French and Swiss and Canadian sound experts listen to the voice, run it through voice identification software.
[00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:15.507]  We're good to go.
[00:09:36.692 --> 00:09:39.133]  Saying, I'm going to get you in the darkened room.
[00:09:39.273 --> 00:09:40.093]  I'm Bin Laden.
[00:09:40.493 --> 00:09:42.154]  Remember that?
[00:09:42.694 --> 00:09:44.455]  And then even the newspapers here in the U.S.
[00:09:44.495 --> 00:09:46.135]  said, okay, it's not Bin Laden.
[00:09:46.275 --> 00:09:47.116]  It's an imposter.
[00:09:48.456 --> 00:09:53.898]  And it's not even good theater or lies they're putting out.
[00:09:53.938 --> 00:09:55.178]  It's so easy to disprove.
[00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:59.880]  And so they tested the voice, and it was not Osama Bin Laden.
[00:10:01.613 --> 00:10:10.975]  And then last year, they would release new videos of Bin Laden and Al Javari and other people, and then say, oh, it's a new tape.
[00:10:11.035 --> 00:10:12.176]  See, he's going to get us any minute.
[00:10:12.236 --> 00:10:12.996]  Oh, it's a new tape.
[00:10:13.576 --> 00:10:19.477]  And then they'd quietly admit, okay, it's edited tapes from two years ago, re-released.
[00:10:20.858 --> 00:10:29.900]  This is the same government that's been caught planting false news articles in the newspapers, fake letters from the troops with false signatures on it,
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:38.844]  This is the same government that's been caught falsifying documents, creating fake, out-of-hole-cloth Niger uranium stories.
[00:10:39.444 --> 00:10:50.269]  The same government that's been caught red-handed, knowing that those mobile trucks in Iraq had been sold to Saddam in 1985, that the UN had looked at them in 1992.
[00:10:50.769 --> 00:10:54.671]  They had British serial numbers for pumping up hydrogen balloons.
[00:10:55.828 --> 00:11:07.431]  They knew exactly what it was, but for months, and frankly they're still saying they're mobile weapons trucks, even after it's admitted they're not, the mass graves were an exchange program from the Iran-Iraq war.
[00:11:07.451 --> 00:11:11.072]  That's why they were big coffins full of sand and bones.
[00:11:11.932 --> 00:11:20.795]  And it turned out that our government had known about that since the inspections in 1992, but ran to the scene of the warehouse and said, look, mass graves.
[00:11:22.487 --> 00:11:25.990]  I mean, there are literally hundreds of other lies they've been caught in.
[00:11:26.551 --> 00:11:30.835]  Over 20 times they said they found weapons of mass destruction and it would always turn out to be a fraud.
[00:11:31.636 --> 00:11:34.078]  Now, the country's littered with weapons of mass destruction.
[00:11:34.458 --> 00:11:35.839]  Chemical, biological weapons.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:41.004]  But, those are already declared sites and in most cases it's got U.S.
[00:11:41.124 --> 00:11:43.907]  markings so that's embarrassing so they don't want to
[00:11:44.528 --> 00:11:53.930]  You know, go have a fake discovery there, because they already go to declared sites if the French or the Germans or the British or the Russians sell it to them.
[00:11:54.130 --> 00:11:55.711]  It's already a declared site.
[00:11:56.471 --> 00:11:57.491]  It was already admitted to.
[00:11:58.592 --> 00:12:01.312]  So they run there and say, oh, look, we found weapons of mass destruction.
[00:12:01.572 --> 00:12:03.813]  Then it would turn out that it was already declared and already documented.
[00:12:04.545 --> 00:12:10.546]  But there's lots of other places they won't even have fake discoveries yet because it's U.S.
[00:12:11.926 --> 00:12:21.128]  delivery systems as well as the chemicals and biologicals in the different artillery and rockets and other goodies.
[00:12:22.828 --> 00:12:30.290]  So that's the reality of the fraud we're being given and now purported bin Laden truce is rejected.
[00:12:31.210 --> 00:12:31.930]  Now remember...
[00:12:32.896 --> 00:12:38.941]  About a month before the Iraq War, Colin Powell, who'd been against the war, and I told you he would suddenly come out for the war.
[00:12:38.981 --> 00:12:40.082]  It's a classic tactic.
[00:12:40.762 --> 00:12:41.843]  Oh, he's the dove.
[00:12:42.043 --> 00:12:43.004]  Oh, he's the good guy.
[00:12:43.344 --> 00:12:44.345]  Man, he's telling the truth.
[00:12:44.445 --> 00:12:46.647]  And suddenly, I was wrong, he said.
[00:12:46.687 --> 00:12:48.028]  We've got to go to war now.
[00:12:48.328 --> 00:12:50.210]  We know he's got the weapons of mass destruction.
[00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:50.870]  Imminent threat.
[00:12:51.711 --> 00:13:00.958]  And then he goes before the Senate, Powell does, and says, right now on Al Jazeera, which is a CIA front, basically, right now on Al Jazeera,
[00:13:01.826 --> 00:13:06.710]  They're airing a tape where Bin Laden says that he's working with Saddam.
[00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:18.458]  And they said, and the press corps literally ran out of the room while he's still testifying, come back in an hour later and go, and the chairman goes, excuse me, I've been told by staffers and the press that Al Jazeera has gotten no such tape.
[00:13:18.478 --> 00:13:20.400]  And he goes, oh, they'll have it the next few hours.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.722]  And indeed, they got the new tape.
[00:13:23.162 --> 00:13:23.962]  I'm Bin Laden.
[00:13:24.022 --> 00:13:25.143]  I'm going to get you.
[00:13:25.604 --> 00:13:26.865]  I work with Saddam.
[00:13:26.945 --> 00:13:28.306]  Ha ha, we're good buddies.
[00:13:28.886 --> 00:13:45.187]  Man, at just the moment they wanted to put out the fraud that Saddam works with bin Laden, which is now a total admitted fraud, a total lie, magically bin Laden pops out of the box and does exactly what they need done.
[00:13:46.149 --> 00:14:01.856]  Well, he's just coming through over and over again, just like he did in the 80s, fighting the Soviets, just like he did in 1998, according to a Republican Senate report in 99, attacking the Serbs, getting them to fight back, and then the globalists go in and attack the Serbs and take over and engage in genocide against them.
[00:14:03.217 --> 00:14:05.518]  Reported bin Laden truce is rejected.
[00:14:05.558 --> 00:14:12.681]  A man identifying himself as someone bin Laden offered a truce to European countries that do not attack Muslims, saying it would begin...
[00:14:13.827 --> 00:14:20.873]  When their soldiers leave Islamic nations, according to a recording broadcast Thursday on Arabic satellite networks.
[00:14:22.434 --> 00:14:26.517]  He also talked about how the war in Iraq is all about Halliburton, which is totally true.
[00:14:26.778 --> 00:14:27.258]  Partially.
[00:14:27.418 --> 00:14:35.625]  It's about oil, weapon sales, using Iraq as a launch base to attack other countries, a smoke screen for domestic crackdowns, and police state here.
[00:14:36.798 --> 00:14:43.521]  But by doing that scene, now when you say it's about Halliburton, now see, oh, you're with Bin Laden.
[00:14:44.121 --> 00:14:47.723]  And the neocons are all crowing this and yelling this and saying, See?
[00:14:47.743 --> 00:14:47.803]  See?
[00:14:51.078 --> 00:14:52.919]  In fact, let me tell you what Savage will say tonight.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:54.020]  Because I already know.
[00:14:54.821 --> 00:14:55.421]  And watch.
[00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:56.482]  You tune in, he'll say this.
[00:14:57.003 --> 00:15:00.565]  You see, I told you we should arrest everyone that says Halliburton's corrupt.
[00:15:00.926 --> 00:15:04.869]  You see, I told you those criticizing the government are aiding terrorists.
[00:15:05.189 --> 00:15:07.651]  Arrest anyone that says Halliburton is corrupt.
[00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:12.334]  Is there just to make money and that this is a big scam?
[00:15:12.635 --> 00:15:15.597]  You see, Bin Laden's got the same rhetoric as the liberals.
[00:15:15.877 --> 00:15:16.838]  Let's arrest them!
[00:15:17.078 --> 00:15:18.279]  Force labor camps!
[00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:19.379]  They're traitors!
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:20.981]  Their tongues are traitorous!
[00:15:21.201 --> 00:15:21.801]  See how that works?
[00:15:21.981 --> 00:15:25.104]  But really, he's the dirty, oily, beat-neck socialist.
[00:15:25.564 --> 00:15:36.692]  They always, the weathermen and their ilk, always, I'm not saying he's a weatherman, but that same degenerate, oily, beat-neck type,
[00:15:38.112 --> 00:15:44.234]  That whole group always, you know, the big discussions in the 60s were re-education camps, but they couldn't sell it to you.
[00:15:44.434 --> 00:15:49.316]  So they act like conservatives and sell it to you, as Ron Paul has exposed the neocons for doing.
[00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:54.118]  So that's what you're, I mean, I'm already hearing it this morning, but I know that it will be even worse on Savage.
[00:15:54.398 --> 00:15:56.979]  Because I hear it, I mean, whenever I tune in once a month, it's the same thing.
[00:15:56.999 --> 00:15:59.660]  Every time I tune in, look, people in camps, they disagree.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.441]  Forced labor camps, you've all heard it.
[00:16:02.225 --> 00:16:04.165]  We've got top generals calling for this.
[00:16:04.185 --> 00:16:05.106]  This is a good thing.
[00:16:05.786 --> 00:16:09.387]  Rocky Mountain News says they've got mass graves and incinerators ready for you.
[00:16:10.327 --> 00:16:12.647]  They said because of a biological attack, it's for your safety.
[00:16:13.948 --> 00:16:15.168]  And so that's what you'll hear now.
[00:16:15.268 --> 00:16:18.529]  See, he always puts out the exact rhetoric that's needed.
[00:16:18.589 --> 00:16:29.811]  I mean, Halliburton is there, no bids allowed, caught double-charging on fuel, caught feeding rotten meals to the troops, running the concentration camps for the Iraqis, just all this horrible stuff.
[00:16:31.995 --> 00:16:34.877]  And then Bin Laden comes out and says it.
[00:16:34.897 --> 00:16:35.618]  See how that works?
[00:16:35.658 --> 00:16:37.999]  So Bin Laden's always been a good CIA asset.
[00:16:38.259 --> 00:16:44.184]  I love that photo of him with the short haircut and no beard sitting in his Cadillac back in the 80s.
[00:16:44.504 --> 00:16:47.065]  He's always been a good officer of the New World Order.
[00:16:47.166 --> 00:16:50.948]  Very, very, very hopeful person for George Bush's business partner.
[00:16:50.968 --> 00:16:53.430]  And, of course, Saddam Bush's business partner.
[00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.451]  And Manuel Noriega Bush's business partner.
[00:16:55.531 --> 00:16:56.912]  They're always business partners.
[00:16:57.653 --> 00:16:59.454]  It's like the Legion of Doom, folks.
[00:16:59.494 --> 00:17:00.875]  That's who the globalists are.
[00:17:01.642 --> 00:17:10.824]  And, you know, you've got Dr. Evil up there with Bush's daddy, Dr. Evil, and you've got many-me running around.
[00:17:12.044 --> 00:17:16.585]  Purported bin Laden truce is rejected, so we'll get more into that.
[00:17:17.125 --> 00:17:21.906]  But before we do that, the globalists love to throw it in your face.
[00:17:22.487 --> 00:17:23.147]  They love it.
[00:17:23.207 --> 00:17:24.267]  It's an enjoyment.
[00:17:25.427 --> 00:17:28.448]  And in The Long Kiss Goodnight, a major film,
[00:17:29.156 --> 00:17:32.198]  With Geena Davis and Samuel L. Jackson.
[00:17:34.739 --> 00:17:36.620]  And this film came out in 1996.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:43.103]  The 1996 action film provides yet more anecdotal evidence of government complicity in 9-11.
[00:17:43.483 --> 00:17:55.909]  In a similar vein to the expose of the lone gunman aired on Fox March 2001, the action film The Long Kiss Goodnight proves yet more revelations of the method of government complicity and attacks on the World Trade Center.
[00:17:56.576 --> 00:18:16.066]  The clip featured on the page not only hints of government complicity and terror attacks in order to increase budget spending and a ratchet of control, but it also names the World Trade Center as a target, and it's a secret government leader saying, we tried to blow it up once, we're going to blow it up again, we're going to kill 4,000 people.
[00:18:16.626 --> 00:18:23.410]  Referring to the 93 bombing of the Trade Center, Samuel L. Jackson's character is told the CIA were complicit in the bombing.
[00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:26.211]  This is almost accurate.
[00:18:26.707 --> 00:18:29.168]  It was in fact the FBI that were complicit in the bombing.
[00:18:29.268 --> 00:18:32.170]  Cook the bomb, train the driver, Chicago Tribune reported.
[00:18:32.590 --> 00:18:43.395]  The character is then told in explicit detail by the shadowy government official that 4,000 people will be killed in a fake terrorist event on American soil in order to get some money out of Congress.
[00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:48.178]  Of course, this event will be blamed on Muslims naturally, he says.
[00:18:48.858 --> 00:19:02.409]  Not only is the 4,000 number eerily accurate, the clip virtually mirrors the Lone Gunman episode where the shadowy government official tells the hero that a large-scale terror attack will be carried out to create mass fear and total government control.
[00:19:02.429 --> 00:19:10.615]  In the Lone Gunman episode, the detail is extremely accurate and the attack is to be a jet flown to the World Trade Center North Tower.
[00:19:10.655 --> 00:19:17.260]  So when we get back, I'm going to air that little clip from the Lone Gunman where he's talking to the top government official
[00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:20.632]  Saying, you know, well, who are the terrorists?
[00:19:20.652 --> 00:19:22.353]  He says, well, it's the Cold War people.
[00:19:22.393 --> 00:19:25.495]  They want to fly a plane into the building to get control.
[00:19:26.816 --> 00:19:29.799]  And then the next clip they say, oh, it's the World Trade Center.
[00:19:29.819 --> 00:19:33.642]  And then I want to air this long kiss goodnight clip.
[00:19:34.928 --> 00:19:36.929]  Where they do the same thing.
[00:19:37.029 --> 00:19:42.793]  So are you starting to... Condoleezza Rice had never heard of a plan.
[00:19:43.273 --> 00:19:46.135]  There had just been 50-plus mainstream front-page articles.
[00:19:46.455 --> 00:19:49.096]  The government had just run drills of it the morning of 9-11.
[00:19:50.737 --> 00:19:52.919]  That was how everybody stood down.
[00:19:52.939 --> 00:19:55.080]  I mean, come on.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.761]  They love to flaunt it.
[00:19:58.062 --> 00:19:58.742]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.164 --> 00:20:02.765]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:20:03.126 --> 00:20:08.870]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:20:09.130 --> 00:20:14.274]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:20:14.615 --> 00:20:23.882]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, fried halomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:20:24.242 --> 00:20:29.204]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:20:29.504 --> 00:20:33.505]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:20:33.725 --> 00:20:38.467]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:20:38.847 --> 00:20:44.749]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:20:45.109 --> 00:20:51.319]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.

[00:20:52.421 --> 00:20:53.623]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:21:01.039 --> 00:21:02.560]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:03.860]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.461]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:07.581 --> 00:21:07.981]  Phenol?
[00:21:08.322 --> 00:21:15.424]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:21:15.724 --> 00:21:19.825]  ETA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:21:19.945 --> 00:21:20.386]  Fragrance?
[00:21:20.766 --> 00:21:25.527]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:21:25.667 --> 00:21:30.269]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:21:30.569 --> 00:21:33.131]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:21:33.371 --> 00:21:36.793]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:21:36.933 --> 00:21:40.516]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[00:21:43.217 --> 00:21:44.098]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:21:44.218 --> 00:21:53.965]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:04.792]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a gold alert from Midas Resources.
[00:22:05.192 --> 00:22:07.234]  Folks, it's time to shed your complacency.
[00:22:07.574 --> 00:22:10.156]  Gold has seldom, if ever, been a better buy.
[00:22:10.536 --> 00:22:15.080]  Midas Resources is now in a position to potentially show you considerable profits.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:17.061]  But you have to act now!
[00:22:17.261 --> 00:22:23.386]  With $10 collector gold coins at the closest price to melt I've seen in my 24 years in the business.
[00:22:23.843 --> 00:22:30.365]  These are the same coins that are likely to soon command substantial premium prices as they have in the past.
[00:22:30.605 --> 00:22:34.146]  We can deliver them to you now with minimal downside risk.
[00:22:34.386 --> 00:22:37.847]  Or we can let you buy them later at a considerable higher price.
[00:22:38.267 --> 00:22:40.548]  Don't buy them later, folks.
[00:22:40.888 --> 00:22:41.728]  Do it now.
[00:22:41.988 --> 00:22:51.331]  That's $10 collector gold coins, $10 and $20 collector gold coins, at the nearest of melt in my 24 years in this business called Midas Resources.
[00:22:51.715 --> 00:22:52.397]  800-686-2237 That's Midas at 800-686-2237
[00:23:00.811 --> 00:23:04.412]  Are you one of the millions of Americans who suffer from gum disease like gingivitis?
[00:23:04.632 --> 00:23:06.053]  If so, hope has arrived.
[00:23:06.533 --> 00:23:07.973]  I'd like to introduce you to Vitamir.
[00:23:08.234 --> 00:23:13.415]  Vitamir is the all-natural toothpaste and mouthwash designed to protect against and promote healing of gum disease.
[00:23:13.775 --> 00:23:18.257]  Unlike most toothpaste and mouthwash, Vitamir contains no alcohol, no sugar, and no fluoride.
[00:23:18.557 --> 00:23:27.200]  Instead, Vitamir products contain zinc to inhibit plaque growth and promote healing, folic acid to reduce inflammation, myrrh used since biblical times for gum disease, and clove oil.
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.861]  Gum disease is serious.
[00:23:29.341 --> 00:23:33.084]  Research links gum disease to health problems like diabetes, stroke, and heart disease.
[00:23:33.364 --> 00:23:39.989]  With a regular program of oral hygiene including vitamin toothpaste and mouthwash, your chances of experiencing gum disease will be greatly diminished.
[00:23:40.330 --> 00:23:44.373]  Find out for yourself why health professionals across America are recommending Vitamir.
[00:23:44.793 --> 00:23:46.774]  Order yours today from Cliff Scott Enterprises.

[00:23:47.855 --> 00:23:48.155]  That's 800-569-4340.
[00:23:48.175 --> 00:23:49.636]  Or visit their website at www.cliffscott.com.
[00:24:06.019 --> 00:24:07.940]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:08.401 --> 00:24:11.242]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:13.063 --> 00:24:19.027]  The New York Lottery on the one-year anniversary of 9-11.
[00:24:19.427 --> 00:24:22.809]  Not the Texas, not the Illinois, not the Ohio.
[00:24:22.829 --> 00:24:26.552]  The New York Lottery came up 9-11.
[00:24:27.972 --> 00:24:30.414]  They said that the odds of that were in the hundreds of millions.
[00:24:32.634 --> 00:24:40.579]  Now, it was the odds of the Chicago Mercantile coming up 9-1-1 with a bunch of zeros behind it, 9-1-1.0000.
[00:24:41.039 --> 00:24:44.021]  They've never had 0-0-0-0s, much less 9-1-1.
[00:24:44.321 --> 00:24:45.222]  They've had that a few times.
[00:24:45.782 --> 00:24:49.664]  That was more than one out of 14 billion.
[00:24:50.005 --> 00:24:52.346]  So magically that day, those two things happened.
[00:24:52.546 --> 00:24:55.628]  You combine the chances of that happening, it's impossible.
[00:24:56.689 --> 00:24:59.750]  And then magically, of course, on 3-11-1,
[00:25:01.435 --> 00:25:08.441]  This year, 911 days after 9-11, we have the Madrid bombings that have globalist fingerprints all over it.
[00:25:08.761 --> 00:25:11.623]  The first media reports were the police were planting bombs.
[00:25:11.923 --> 00:25:17.608]  The news said they didn't know why, and then the building blows up and kills the supposed Madrid mastermind Muslims.
[00:25:19.189 --> 00:25:20.570]  Very convenient as usual.
[00:25:20.610 --> 00:25:22.191]  So this is what they do.
[00:25:22.772 --> 00:25:30.198]  In the sniper case, white men and white vans are seen doing the shooting by police and others, but just forget what cops saw and other professionals.
[00:25:31.068 --> 00:25:37.595]  It's these two black guys, one of them, who has this weird history of mind control programs.
[00:25:38.716 --> 00:25:39.757]  And, of course, there's a U.S.
[00:25:39.797 --> 00:25:43.281]  government plan to carry out sniper attacks in D.C., Operation Northwoods.
[00:25:43.481 --> 00:25:46.304]  It even describes how to frame patsies on page nine.
[00:25:47.901 --> 00:25:48.701]  What is Scenario 12-D?
[00:25:48.741 --> 00:25:49.041]  We know
[00:26:17.748 --> 00:26:20.949]  It's a war game scenario, and it has to do with airline counter-terrorism.
[00:26:22.390 --> 00:26:23.851]  Why is that important enough to kill for?
[00:26:24.551 --> 00:26:25.891]  Because it's no longer a game.
[00:26:25.911 --> 00:26:34.475]  But if some terrorist group wants to act out this scenario, why target you for assassination?
[00:26:34.495 --> 00:26:36.556]  Depends on who your terrorists are.
[00:26:38.637 --> 00:26:40.277]  The men who conceived of it in the first place.
[00:26:42.758 --> 00:26:46.360]  You're saying our government plans to commit a terrorist act against a domestic airline?
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:46.760]  There you go.
[00:26:47.376 --> 00:26:48.917]  And dang the entire government, as usual.
[00:26:48.937 --> 00:26:50.097]  It's a faction.
[00:26:50.418 --> 00:26:51.438]  A small faction.
[00:26:51.498 --> 00:26:52.639]  For what possible gain?
[00:26:53.659 --> 00:26:55.180]  The Cold War's over, John.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.982]  But with no clear enemy to stockpile against, the arms market's flat.
[00:26:59.562 --> 00:27:11.627]  But bring down a fully loaded 727 into the middle of New York City, and you'll find a dozen tin-pot dictators all over the world just clamoring to take responsibility and begging to be smart-bombed.
[00:27:12.108 --> 00:27:12.648]  I can't believe it.
[00:27:12.768 --> 00:27:14.549]  This is about increasing arms sales.
[00:27:14.729 --> 00:27:14.809]  Hmm.
[00:27:15.541 --> 00:27:17.007]  Now, that's the first clip.
[00:27:17.067 --> 00:27:21.161]  Then in the next clip they get into, it's the World Trade Center remote control and all this.
[00:27:22.327 --> 00:27:32.714]  Just months before 9-11, Fox, who has the contract to break down the family, to show men in a bad light, you know, the most degenerate stuff, and then they have the conservative news channel to keep you in line.
[00:27:33.475 --> 00:27:39.559]  But this was a major Hollywood film, The Long Kiss Goodnight with Samuel L. Jackson and others.
[00:27:39.579 --> 00:27:43.342]  This is Samuel L. Jackson when he comes up against the shadowy CIA guy.
[00:27:43.902 --> 00:27:45.043]  Go ahead and hit that clip.
[00:27:45.403 --> 00:27:48.445]  Is there a fundraiser?
[00:27:48.465 --> 00:27:48.445]  1993.
[00:27:49.987 --> 00:27:51.488]  World Trade Center bombing.
[00:27:51.688 --> 00:27:52.028]  Remember him?
[00:27:54.369 --> 00:27:58.271]  During the trial, one of the bombers claimed the CIA had advanced knowledge.
[00:28:01.692 --> 00:28:04.674]  The diplomat who issued the terrorist visa was CIA.
[00:28:05.594 --> 00:28:10.836]  It's not unthinkable they paved the way for the bombing, purely to justify a budget increase.
[00:28:11.457 --> 00:28:15.999]  You're telling me that you're going to fake some terrorist thing just to scare some money out of Congress?
[00:28:16.059 --> 00:28:20.301]  Well, unfortunately, Mr. Hennessy, I have no idea how to fake killing 4,000 people.
[00:28:21.761 --> 00:28:23.322]  So we're just going to have to do it for real.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.801]  Oh, blame it on the Muslims, naturally.
[00:28:27.981 --> 00:28:29.061]  That I get my funding.
[00:28:30.302 --> 00:28:31.042]  Good night, old girl.
[00:28:32.883 --> 00:28:34.343]  Kennedy, I'll be in shopper one.
[00:28:35.284 --> 00:28:38.765]  I'll be in shopper one.
[00:28:39.685 --> 00:28:40.426]  And there you go.
[00:28:40.446 --> 00:28:41.346]  We'll hear that again.
[00:28:41.366 --> 00:28:44.587]  Of course, it wasn't CIA.
[00:28:45.928 --> 00:28:47.568]  It was the FBI.
[00:28:48.489 --> 00:28:49.709]  And that's admitted.
[00:28:49.749 --> 00:28:51.430]  That's in my film, Mainstream News.
[00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:52.670]  Just quietly in the back of the paper.
[00:28:52.830 --> 00:28:54.831]  Oh, yeah, we'd cook the bomb, train the driver, let it happen.
[00:28:55.703 --> 00:29:03.087]  But, oh, they're going to do it again to kill 4,000 this time, and they have no idea how to fake it, so they're just going to have to do it for real.
[00:29:04.528 --> 00:29:11.552]  You like it being flaunted, and then there's the Phillips TV ad years before 9-11, two years before where F-16s bombed the World Trade Centers.
[00:29:12.293 --> 00:29:15.335]  It says, Phillips, changing your world.
[00:29:15.355 --> 00:29:19.177]  Oh, yes, you really are changing, aren't you?
[00:29:20.126 --> 00:29:21.206]  Things have changed after 9-11.
[00:29:21.226 --> 00:29:25.827]  Got to give our rights up so they can keep us safe, the men in black uniforms.
[00:29:28.008 --> 00:29:31.129]  So, yet another in-your-face piece.
[00:29:31.169 --> 00:29:37.430]  But what this does prove, at the bare minimum, is the government, no one had ever thought of flying a plane into a building.
[00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:42.571]  No, they just had hundreds of federal reports, 50 mainstream reports, all these drills.
[00:29:44.732 --> 00:29:47.953]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with all the news and your calls.
[00:29:48.013 --> 00:29:48.813]  Please stay with us.
[00:29:51.425 --> 00:29:52.327]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.827 --> 00:29:54.430]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.351 --> 00:29:58.036]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.425 --> 00:30:07.648]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:30:07.788 --> 00:30:13.950]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:22.674]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:30:22.914 --> 00:30:29.937]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:30:30.257 --> 00:30:35.080]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.684]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[00:30:41.044 --> 00:30:44.106]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[00:30:44.447 --> 00:30:52.412]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:30:52.452 --> 00:30:53.032]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:31:00.977 --> 00:31:06.098]  I'm a nurse and I injured my back and I've lost 22 pounds and 9 inches.
[00:31:06.378 --> 00:31:08.518]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[00:31:09.039 --> 00:31:13.639]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[00:31:13.959 --> 00:31:15.340]  It actually works.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:19.140]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.721]  I've tried many, many products.
[00:31:20.881 --> 00:31:23.101]  I have never experienced anything like collagenated.
[00:31:23.501 --> 00:31:27.142]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than 8 weeks.
[00:31:27.542 --> 00:31:28.202]  It truly works.
[00:31:28.547 --> 00:31:29.688]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[00:31:30.108 --> 00:31:35.851]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:31:35.911 --> 00:31:41.734]  Vim and Vigor's collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[00:31:41.874 --> 00:31:44.436]  Vim and Vigor's collagenate really does work.
[00:31:44.836 --> 00:31:45.857]  It's healthy for you, too.
[00:31:46.037 --> 00:31:47.057]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[00:31:47.077 --> 00:31:47.477]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:31:47.497 --> 00:31:47.878]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:31:47.958 --> 00:31:49.999]  Get $25 off a three-month supply of collagenate.
[00:31:50.059 --> 00:31:50.599]  So call now.
[00:31:50.619 --> 00:31:50.759]  1-800-622-THIN.
[00:31:50.919 --> 00:31:51.139]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[00:32:01.716 --> 00:32:02.716]  It's finally here.
[00:32:02.856 --> 00:32:03.837]  Spring has arrived.
[00:32:04.037 --> 00:32:06.998]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:32:07.218 --> 00:32:10.659]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:32:10.879 --> 00:32:19.041]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can too with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:32:19.301 --> 00:32:23.022]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[00:32:23.242 --> 00:32:28.244]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[00:32:28.464 --> 00:32:30.086]  Many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[00:32:44.804 --> 00:32:50.287]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[00:32:50.467 --> 00:32:54.209]  Call the ARC Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.
[00:32:54.269 --> 00:32:59.892]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arcinstitute.com today.
[00:32:59.912 --> 00:33:10.097]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:10.697 --> 00:33:13.659]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:19.301]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:33:19.421 --> 00:33:20.822]  until 2 p.m.
[00:33:20.882 --> 00:33:25.625]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight Central, with a rebroadcast from 1 a.m.
[00:33:25.645 --> 00:33:26.345]  to 4 a.m.
[00:33:26.465 --> 00:33:30.108]  Nine hours a day, you can't miss the show, no matter what schedule you're on.
[00:33:30.128 --> 00:33:34.490]  We're going to have open phones halfway into this first hour now.
[00:33:34.510 --> 00:33:34.630]  1-800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[00:33:43.092 --> 00:34:12.635]  And later in the next hour, I'll re-air this latest clip from the Hollywood production with Samuel L. Jackson and Gina Davis of the Long Kiss Goodnight, 1996, where a secret government group bombs the World Trade Center the first time, which is admitted in public, and they're going to bomb it again and try to kill 4,000 as a pretext to sell weapons and attack the Muslims.
[00:34:14.139 --> 00:34:18.960]  And, of course, the lone gunman says the same thing on Fox, just flaunting it endlessly.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:21.201]  And you add all the other places where they do this together.
[00:34:22.021 --> 00:34:22.981]  It is staggering.
[00:34:23.822 --> 00:34:39.506]  It is staggering with two Tom Clancy best-selling books and all the real drills and all the real news articles and Bush ordering the FBI not to stop al-Qaeda, Clinton ordering the FBI not to stop al-Qaeda, their CIA asset using them to attack the Serbs in the late 90s.
[00:34:40.046 --> 00:34:41.807]  It's the same story over and over again.
[00:34:41.847 --> 00:34:42.787]  So that's coming back up.
[00:34:43.593 --> 00:34:46.574]  There's more implantable microchip news, more RFID chip news.
[00:34:46.594 --> 00:34:49.674]  You're going to have to have it in your car to track and trace you, the government's saying.
[00:34:50.515 --> 00:34:51.735]  A bunch of new developments.
[00:34:52.195 --> 00:34:56.216]  CIA officer Ben Laden is supposedly saying that he wants a truce now.
[00:34:57.156 --> 00:34:59.257]  Saying exactly what the globalists want to hear.
[00:35:00.617 --> 00:35:01.737]  We'll get into that as well.
[00:35:02.397 --> 00:35:04.218]  Right now, let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[00:35:04.338 --> 00:35:05.678]  Daryl in Colorado.
[00:35:05.718 --> 00:35:06.658]  Daryl, go ahead.
[00:35:07.319 --> 00:35:07.819]  Hey, Alex.
[00:35:08.019 --> 00:35:10.959]  Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:11.740]  Welcome.
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:13.060]  Was just
[00:35:14.005 --> 00:35:19.870]  Being today a little bit off the tangent, today being tax day, there was a local talk show here in the morning.
[00:35:21.351 --> 00:35:32.780]  They were talking all about taxes and different things, and I called in and was talking about the Federal Reserve, and the talk show host thought it was federal, and I was explaining to him that it's not.
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:43.008]  And he went off on a thing about the Treasury and about producing money, and when they produce it, the money that they produce, they retire the money that they change out.
[00:35:44.700 --> 00:35:50.722]  Well, only 3%, now it's lower than that, of digital numbers in a computer.
[00:35:50.742 --> 00:35:53.143]  There's only 3% actual paper currency.
[00:35:53.163 --> 00:36:02.425]  The Federal Reserve is private, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve orders the governmental Treasury Department, and that's just public knowledge.
[00:36:02.465 --> 00:36:07.347]  It's in the white pages, but when you say it's private, the neocons say it doesn't exist.
[00:36:07.787 --> 00:36:10.808]  Well, let me tell you how out of hand it has gotten in Colorado Springs.
[00:36:12.327 --> 00:36:36.831]  I was explaining to him what you just said, and I even mentioned to him that just about a month ago, I was at the Treasury in Denver, or at the Mint in Denver, going through their tour with my homeschool group, and I mentioned that to him, and that I actually asked the question, and the lady there actually told me that, no, we produce money 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and when we put it out, we don't retire old currency, old money.
[00:36:38.503 --> 00:36:42.426]  Well, they do retire damaged money, but not old currency.
[00:36:42.806 --> 00:36:43.026]  Right.
[00:36:43.186 --> 00:36:45.548]  That's why you get a $5 bill from 1963.
[00:36:45.608 --> 00:36:46.209]  Right.
[00:36:46.949 --> 00:36:49.311]  And old coinage, they don't retire coinage at all.
[00:36:50.372 --> 00:36:55.516]  And so I was explaining this to him, and he said, oh, well, I don't know that that's true.
[00:36:56.016 --> 00:36:58.858]  And then all of a sudden, he lost me, supposedly.
[00:36:58.978 --> 00:37:00.780]  He lost contact because I was on a cell phone.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:02.041]  Basically, he hung up on me.
[00:37:02.601 --> 00:37:04.823]  And I turned up the radio quickly to listen to his response.
[00:37:05.347 --> 00:37:09.230]  And immediately he attacked me and everything on my home.
[00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:19.399]  He said, you know, to go off on a tangent, homeschooling and parents that homeschool their kids, you know, we don't know what damage or what benefits are going to be of that.
[00:37:19.419 --> 00:37:22.502]  Well, all over the country they're trying to ban it, but let's give them the facts.
[00:37:24.967 --> 00:37:44.872]  In fact, the highest grades, winning all the spelling bees, corporations fighting to get them, but when you go to public school, you learn how to snort cocaine, learn how to be a whore, learn how to be a gang member, learn how to thumb scan to get your school lunch, learn how to be frisked by the police, learn how to be drug tested, learn how to be dumbed down from the smartest country in the world.
[00:37:44.892 --> 00:37:45.693]  We're good to go.
[00:38:07.771 --> 00:38:08.953]  Yes, he does very much.
[00:38:08.973 --> 00:38:09.373]  Of course they do.
[00:38:09.513 --> 00:38:13.217]  I heard a neocon two nights ago going, well, I'm for the Second Amendment.
[00:38:13.658 --> 00:38:17.542]  I'm an NRA life member, but I don't think you should be able to own these assault rifles.
[00:38:17.582 --> 00:38:23.048]  This gentleman is actually supposed to be the program director, program manager.
[00:38:23.738 --> 00:38:26.341]  Or what's supposed to be the most conservative talk show here.
[00:38:26.381 --> 00:38:28.663]  Look, this is how the liberals are winning.
[00:38:28.884 --> 00:38:30.826]  They learned how to act like conservatives.
[00:38:31.546 --> 00:38:37.573]  Every dirty big nick that ever ran up a red flag, and I'm serious when I say this, is now in control.
[00:38:37.993 --> 00:38:38.154]  Yep.
[00:38:38.414 --> 00:38:39.775]  They're all dirty, dirty, dirty, dirty big nicks.
[00:38:43.679 --> 00:38:46.680]  Let me finish.
[00:38:47.021 --> 00:38:49.922]  Ron Paul has said that in a 45-minute speech.
[00:38:50.162 --> 00:38:50.982]  He laid it out.
[00:38:51.343 --> 00:38:54.804]  That's why we're losing, because the conservatives haven't figured this out yet.
[00:38:54.844 --> 00:38:55.284]  Go ahead.
[00:38:56.145 --> 00:38:57.485]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:38:57.505 --> 00:39:01.347]  I just wanted to let you know that Colorado Springs is supposed to be this
[00:39:01.912 --> 00:39:02.733]  Yep, totally, and it's all factual.
[00:39:02.753 --> 00:39:04.514]  What you're saying is exactly true.
[00:39:04.534 --> 00:39:05.835]  Not only that, but get this...
[00:39:32.448 --> 00:39:36.633]  They're putting in a big museum downtown, the Pioneer Historical Museum.
[00:39:36.653 --> 00:39:38.435]  It's right in the center of downtown Colorado Springs.
[00:39:38.956 --> 00:39:45.883]  And they're putting in a memorial, huge memorial, to commemorate the heritage and history of Colorado Springs.
[00:39:46.263 --> 00:39:48.466]  And you'll never guess what the memorial is.
[00:39:49.269 --> 00:39:53.152]  It's a huge open-faced pyramid with a sun and all-seeing eye in the middle.
[00:39:53.613 --> 00:39:54.453]  Of course it is!
[00:39:54.473 --> 00:40:00.258]  Hey, take a digital photo, email it to tipsandinfowars.com.
[00:40:00.398 --> 00:40:01.399]  I've got a whole brochure.
[00:40:01.419 --> 00:40:02.440]  They're raising money for it.
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:10.467]  Well, sir, sir, take a photo of the brochure and close-ups and email it to tipsandinfowars.com.
[00:40:12.754 --> 00:40:14.635]  All right, appreciate the call.
[00:40:14.675 --> 00:40:21.760]  In fact, also go to prisonplanet.com and email it to, where it says contact webmaster.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.022]  That's really a good place to go, too, to make sure we get it.
[00:40:25.423 --> 00:40:28.405]  Yeah, oh, by the way, I might as well spend a minute or two on this.
[00:40:28.425 --> 00:40:30.607]  I even forgot to bring it to the studio.
[00:40:31.047 --> 00:40:36.611]  The May issue of Vanity Fair has, I don't know, like a 12-page hit piece.
[00:40:37.939 --> 00:40:47.983]  And guess who is most prominently displayed in the 12-page major sub-cover headline?
[00:40:48.343 --> 00:40:50.744]  It's one of the top stories in the publication.
[00:40:50.824 --> 00:40:53.585]  Jackie Kennedy's number one, and we're like number two in there.
[00:40:55.086 --> 00:41:00.488]  Guess who they attack in the Vanity Fair 12-page spread?
[00:41:02.049 --> 00:41:02.189]  Well...
[00:41:03.248 --> 00:41:04.930]  Paul Joseph Watson is number one.
[00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:05.690]  I'm number two in it.
[00:41:05.870 --> 00:41:08.272]  I mean, the most quoted person is Paul Watson.
[00:41:09.734 --> 00:41:17.220]  And, again, if you think there's these all-seeing eye pyramid new order symbols everywhere, you're crazy.
[00:41:17.881 --> 00:41:19.502]  They mix us in with all these nuts.
[00:41:21.984 --> 00:41:23.065]  It's an amazing article.
[00:41:25.467 --> 00:41:28.710]  So, you know, I now go to the newsstand.
[00:41:28.730 --> 00:41:29.991]  There's Vanity Fair attacking me.
[00:41:33.058 --> 00:41:34.301]  We're in a lot of trouble, folks.
[00:41:34.721 --> 00:41:45.702]  But they're having to respond to us with hour-long C-SPAN attack sessions and Vanity Fair articles and national talk show hosts attacking me because we're exposing them.
[00:41:47.669 --> 00:41:50.550]  And we're not going to stop, and we're going to save this country.
[00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.170]  But, yeah, you're in deep trouble in Colorado Springs.
[00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:54.670]  They say, oh, support the troops.
[00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:55.510]  That's what Hitler said.
[00:41:55.851 --> 00:41:56.651]  Support the troops.
[00:41:56.691 --> 00:42:01.072]  Well, you support the troops by supporting the Bill of Rights that they're supposed to defend.
[00:42:01.292 --> 00:42:03.172]  And we're losing that Bill of Rights right now.
[00:42:04.532 --> 00:42:06.032]  Let's talk to Angus in Canada.
[00:42:06.112 --> 00:42:06.853]  Angus, go ahead.
[00:42:06.873 --> 00:42:08.373]  Hi, Alex.
[00:42:08.553 --> 00:42:09.873]  I hadn't talked to you in a while.
[00:42:10.353 --> 00:42:10.753]  Welcome.
[00:42:11.253 --> 00:42:11.814]  Well, thank you.
[00:42:12.554 --> 00:42:13.334]  I thought I'd call you.
[00:42:13.354 --> 00:42:14.234]  We're talking about movies.
[00:42:15.223 --> 00:42:19.264]  And I spent the last 15 years mucking around the film business.
[00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:25.965]  There's one that was made in 1982 with Sean Connery called Wrong is Right.
[00:42:27.186 --> 00:42:28.446]  And I watched it the other night.
[00:42:28.866 --> 00:42:29.986]  I'd seen it years ago.
[00:42:30.006 --> 00:42:40.909]  And some of the parallels between today's news or recent news and what's contained in this movie certainly makes it worth watching.
[00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:42.289]  What's the movie about?
[00:42:42.910 --> 00:42:58.002]  Well, basically, Sean Connery is an internationally known television reporter, goes on all the big stories, and he goes over to the Middle East, and some terrorist organization wants to get a hold of a couple of suitcase nukes.
[00:42:59.703 --> 00:43:05.708]  And you have a Texas politician who wants to use...
[00:43:07.816 --> 00:43:17.259]  The problems over there for his political gain, and then you have the president who wants to use it for his political gain, and the CIA running around in the midst of it.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:28.963]  And at the end of the movie, you have a full-scale military invasion of the Middle East because a nuke has been detonated in New York.
[00:43:30.044 --> 00:43:37.026]  And it shows the terrorist down his bunker with his two suitcase nukes saying, What nukes?
[00:43:38.733 --> 00:43:44.836]  And Leslie Nielsen plays the politician, not the president.
[00:43:45.416 --> 00:44:01.022]  Well, they've been following these scripts for a long time, and it's been in the Associated Press the last three years that over $40 million is spent in a special scriptwriting house with the Pentagon telling Hollywood what they want to be produced.
[00:44:01.082 --> 00:44:03.063]  I call it propaganda placement.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:07.662]  And this is all being done by design, my friends.
[00:44:07.882 --> 00:44:08.883]  Oh, absolutely, yeah.
[00:44:09.223 --> 00:44:25.793]  Oh, listen, I... I mean, there was the Chicago Sun-Times about two weeks ago, said, you know, Homeland Security, keeping an eye on the country and Hollywood, and this is going on all over the place, and again, this is all part of the flaunting it.
[00:44:26.493 --> 00:44:27.294]  Oh, well, my goodness.
[00:44:27.374 --> 00:44:32.297]  I mean, just look back at some of the feature films and the way Hollywood was co-opted during the Second World War.
[00:44:33.126 --> 00:44:35.287]  I mean, that has never changed.
[00:44:35.307 --> 00:44:37.867]  But then people try to deny all this when it's public.
[00:44:38.667 --> 00:44:47.089]  Well... What do you think of that Long Kiss Goodnight piece where the CIA guy's saying, yeah, we blew up the World Trade Center the first time, and we're going to do it some more?
[00:44:48.009 --> 00:44:53.691]  I haven't personally seen that particular film, but I certainly want to now.
[00:44:55.231 --> 00:44:57.312]  Just, I like Samuel L. Jackson to begin with.
[00:44:57.332 --> 00:44:57.892]  I do, too.
[00:44:58.492 --> 00:44:58.612]  And...
[00:44:59.491 --> 00:45:19.046]  But there's, as propaganda, one of the things is a lot of people that are involved in the industry know this, and when they have opportunity... Well, I was going to say that I know a lot of people in Hollywood, and they actually say, yeah, we know all about it, we're trying to sneak the truth in, and that's also part of it.
[00:45:19.467 --> 00:45:21.168]  Oh, yeah, that very much is the case.
[00:45:22.193 --> 00:45:23.954]  Hey, listen, Angus, I appreciate the call.
[00:45:23.994 --> 00:45:24.955]  Very interesting.
[00:45:24.995 --> 00:45:28.436]  Thanks for the wrong is right 1982 Sean Connery.
[00:45:28.456 --> 00:45:29.397]  We'll have to check that out.
[00:45:30.297 --> 00:45:31.458]  Brian in Ohio.
[00:45:31.518 --> 00:45:32.899]  Brian or Ryan, excuse me.
[00:45:32.939 --> 00:45:33.299]  Go ahead.
[00:45:33.599 --> 00:45:33.979]  Yeah.
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:42.243]  I was wondering, getting your opinion on this, people have been talking about it a little bit, that they're going to have a weapons of mass destruction.
[00:45:42.263 --> 00:45:46.526]  They're going to call martial law and the elections come November.
[00:45:47.046 --> 00:45:50.908]  What would you say the possibility of that happening this year is?
[00:45:52.731 --> 00:45:55.632]  I have to say 50-50, but they're not going to call it martial law.
[00:45:55.652 --> 00:46:03.854]  They're going to call it security and safety and love and happiness and black ski mask equals freedom and secret arrest equals freedom.
[00:46:04.394 --> 00:46:10.076]  When they call it martial law, from what I've been told... Under martial law, it's 1933, sir.
[00:46:10.596 --> 00:46:14.957]  But it's what increment or severity will we be under?
[00:46:15.464 --> 00:46:18.328]  Are they going to shut down radio stations and talk against the government?
[00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:25.437]  No, not... FEMA in 97 doesn't just trust the stations to tune in to their signal and do it now.
[00:46:25.918 --> 00:46:27.360]  Everything is wired through them.
[00:46:28.211 --> 00:46:46.926]  We're not because we're just a network, a transmission point, but all broadcast, AM, FM, UHF, DHF, and cable, everything at the tower or at the transmission site is wired through a kill box where FEMA takes over by giant shortwave transmitters that the systems are tuned to for audio.
[00:46:46.946 --> 00:46:52.331]  They also have satellites for video over TV, and it's the emergency EAS system.
[00:46:53.163 --> 00:46:56.086]  No longer do you hear them go, this is a test of the emergency broadcasting system.
[00:46:56.106 --> 00:46:57.907]  This was a bit of a real emergency.
[00:46:57.927 --> 00:46:59.428]  You'd hear, you know, advisories.
[00:46:59.809 --> 00:47:06.955]  Now you just hear... That is a FEMA takeover drill.
[00:47:09.597 --> 00:47:12.199]  That one show that you were on at night, was it West Coast?
[00:47:12.699 --> 00:47:13.720]  Coast to Coast, yeah.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:16.763]  Yeah, they had a gentleman on there that pretty much talks like you did last night.
[00:47:17.223 --> 00:47:19.525]  And I really think people are really waking up and...
[00:47:20.885 --> 00:47:23.868]  They need to get you on that show again because we're talking 9 million listeners.
[00:47:24.288 --> 00:47:25.309]  A lot more than 9 million.
[00:47:25.609 --> 00:47:26.590]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[00:47:26.630 --> 00:47:27.251]  I appreciate it.
[00:47:27.931 --> 00:47:36.498]  I'm going to be back on Coast to Coast AM the 22nd for four hours, but I'm on there with a couple other interesting individuals, Jim Mars and Steve Quayle.
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:42.544]  So we'll be talking about secret societies and a bunch of other issues.
[00:47:42.624 --> 00:47:47.408]  So, yes, I'd like to go on the show and talk about 9-11, but I did last time I was on some.
[00:47:49.691 --> 00:47:51.954]  Okay, let me cover some news.
[00:47:52.535 --> 00:47:52.915]  I'll do this.
[00:47:52.975 --> 00:47:54.077]  I'll plug the videos right now.
[00:47:54.217 --> 00:47:54.697]  We'll come back.
[00:47:54.757 --> 00:47:55.358]  I'll cover news.
[00:47:55.378 --> 00:47:56.700]  We'll go back to your calls at 800-259-9231.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:56.800]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:47:59.443]  But let me just try to, in a nutshell, tell you what's going on.
[00:48:08.314 --> 00:48:10.775]  The globalists would have already carried out more terror attacks.
[00:48:10.795 --> 00:48:16.259]  9-11 was to get their martial law escalation system in place, which they've now done.
[00:48:16.679 --> 00:48:23.263]  They wanted to go ahead and carry out attacks from all the indicators I got, which creates a very clear picture.
[00:48:24.363 --> 00:48:34.029]  But because of such an awakening that they had not forecast, that they're now trying to control in a judo move, by bringing some of it out and trying to then discredit it,
[00:48:35.409 --> 00:48:36.690]  We've backed them off for now.
[00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:40.913]  They already plan to put out smallpox and dirty bomb a city at the bare minimum.
[00:48:43.015 --> 00:48:50.261]  We're in a very dangerous, precarious situation, but it is safer and better to meet this enemy head-on and to face the horror and to expose it.
[00:48:51.642 --> 00:48:52.883]  But they want martial law.
[00:48:52.903 --> 00:48:53.924]  They want to go all the way.
[00:48:53.944 --> 00:48:54.944]  They want hysteria.
[00:48:54.964 --> 00:48:55.945]  They want breakdowns.
[00:48:56.285 --> 00:49:00.029]  Then to rebuild, then to have a global empire, a national draft.
[00:49:00.389 --> 00:49:02.971]  This is all just lining up the ducks right now.
[00:49:04.557 --> 00:49:05.978]  This is all just in preparation.
[00:49:07.058 --> 00:49:09.420]  And you better listen to me and the military, police, and others.
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:14.743]  You better wake up and face the facts and quit being children and research what we're exposing here.
[00:49:15.643 --> 00:49:17.984]  Because you are all expendable to the globalists.
[00:49:18.044 --> 00:49:19.245]  You are nothing to them.
[00:49:19.265 --> 00:49:24.528]  All right, before we end this segment, again, I've made ten documentary films.
[00:49:24.588 --> 00:49:25.188]  I've written a book.
[00:49:25.248 --> 00:49:25.969]  I've published a book.
[00:49:26.009 --> 00:49:29.851]  We carry a lot of other great books and videos of other authors and researchers.
[00:49:30.976 --> 00:49:34.980]  At InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:40.084]  If you want to know the truth about 9-11, you need to get my film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, two and a half hours long.
[00:49:40.985 --> 00:49:43.727]  Masters of Care, a little bit over two hours, part two of that.
[00:49:44.247 --> 00:49:52.614]  So coming up on, what, four and a half hours of professionally produced expose on 9-11 and those two videos.
[00:49:53.375 --> 00:49:56.397]  There's also the book, 9-11, Ascent to Tyranny, that I read about 9-11.
[00:49:57.058 --> 00:49:57.979]  You need to have these.
[00:49:58.723 --> 00:50:04.907]  You're authorized to make copies of my videos and spread the word and force multiply and smash the globalist lies.
[00:50:05.587 --> 00:50:15.634]  I've got other films like America Destroyed by Design, America Wake Up or Waco, Police State 2000, Police State 2 The Takeover, Police State 3 Total Enslavement, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:50:16.232 --> 00:50:18.873]  Call toll-free to get the videos.
[00:50:18.893 --> 00:50:19.493]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:50:20.414 --> 00:50:29.217]  We've got George Humphrey's books on tape about 9-11, about the New World Order as well.
[00:50:29.237 --> 00:50:30.798]  We've got a lot of other great information.
[00:50:31.770 --> 00:50:48.480]  1-888-253-3139 or just write to me, I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:50:48.700 --> 00:50:56.945]  And bottom line, if you don't help us get the word out and spread the word about who the real terrorists are, they're going to keep carrying out the terror to get more control.
[00:50:57.246 --> 00:50:58.526]  We've got to expose this.
[00:50:58.546 --> 00:50:59.447]  This is a key area.
[00:51:01.289 --> 00:51:05.636]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.816 --> 00:51:10.183]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:12.705 --> 00:51:14.766]  This disaster is a new world order.
[00:51:14.866 --> 00:51:17.627]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:51:17.947 --> 00:51:22.169]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.229 --> 00:51:29.152]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.292 --> 00:51:31.293]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:31.553 --> 00:51:41.998]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.278 --> 00:51:47.660]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Take Three, is for you.

[00:54:13.367 --> 00:54:39.883]  In the dystopic classic 1984 by Mr. Blair, then named George Arwell, in the nightmare future, which we now see developing from what he'd seen in Soviet countries, there is a boogeyman, a bearded, turbaned boogeyman called Goldstein.
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:44.602]  And he surfaces from time to time.
[00:54:44.642 --> 00:54:45.943]  He blows up buildings.
[00:54:45.983 --> 00:54:46.644]  He attacks.
[00:54:46.664 --> 00:54:47.845]  He can never be defeated.
[00:54:48.865 --> 00:54:53.428]  And Winston works for the media, the Ministry of Truth, which does nothing but lie.
[00:54:54.449 --> 00:54:57.591]  He finds out that Goldstein really works for the government.
[00:54:58.512 --> 00:55:03.275]  And, you know, he'll be walking along in a missile, drop and blow up part of an apartment block, and there's dead bodies everywhere.
[00:55:03.295 --> 00:55:04.716]  And that's just to keep the fear going.
[00:55:06.656 --> 00:55:10.561]  And this Goldstein can never be defeated, but all of his people keep getting arrested.
[00:55:10.581 --> 00:55:17.690]  Anybody that criticizes the government or looks at somebody wrong or complains about the cameras in the bathrooms, the stuff that's happening in America today.
[00:55:18.290 --> 00:55:24.298]  I mean, Michael Savage would have been a good guy at the Ministry of Peace or the Ministry of Truth.
[00:55:27.432 --> 00:55:28.673]  He would have been a good O'Brien.
[00:55:28.813 --> 00:55:32.875]  You know, sit there and anybody who disagrees goes to the FEMA camp.
[00:55:33.155 --> 00:55:35.417]  That's what O'Brien, the torture master, believes.
[00:55:36.097 --> 00:55:37.138]  Torture is good in 1984.
[00:55:37.258 --> 00:55:38.258]  It's now good in America.
[00:55:39.159 --> 00:55:40.659]  And that's all this is with bin Laden.
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:43.381]  Purported bin Laden truce is rejected.
[00:55:43.521 --> 00:55:55.688]  A man identifying himself as bin Laden offered a truce to European countries that do not attack Muslims, saying we begin when their soldiers leave Islamic nations, according to a recording broadcast Thursday on Arab satellite networks.
[00:55:57.017 --> 00:56:02.421]  Britain, Germany, Italy, Spain quickly spurned what appeared to be an attempt to drive a wedge between Europe and America.
[00:56:02.481 --> 00:56:10.607]  The tape, which ran in full at more than seven minutes, also vowed revenge against America for the Israeli assassination of Hamas founder.
[00:56:11.808 --> 00:56:17.132]  He also said it's all about oil, Halliburton, so now when you criticize Halliburton, you're a traitor, you need to be arrested.
[00:56:18.780 --> 00:56:22.442]  To see you're out there with bin Laden's words, working for him.
[00:56:22.502 --> 00:56:26.243]  They claim that bin Laden and Saddam secretly run all the peace groups in America.
[00:56:26.603 --> 00:56:32.186]  Oh, no, the Carnegie and Ford and Rockefeller Foundations do, controlling the false left to make sure the wars continue.
[00:56:32.466 --> 00:56:34.527]  By the way, John Forbes carries all for the war.
[00:56:34.567 --> 00:56:37.988]  He just wants the UN to be the boss and playing good cop, bad cop.
[00:56:38.028 --> 00:56:39.169]  It's totally disgusting.
[00:56:40.169 --> 00:56:41.990]  And this whole thing is sick.
[00:56:43.820 --> 00:56:47.022]  So it's just an unbelievable joke.
[00:56:47.362 --> 00:56:48.523]  We're going to break here in a few minutes.
[00:56:48.543 --> 00:56:52.785]  We'll go straight back to your calls, Michael and Joanne and John and Don and Danny and everybody else.
[00:56:54.206 --> 00:56:55.006]  Some of the other news.
[00:56:55.066 --> 00:56:59.369]  Three Japanese hostages in Iraq released into Japan's hands.
[00:56:59.429 --> 00:57:03.511]  Three Japanese civilians taken hostage last week by militants in Iraq were released Thursday.
[00:57:04.551 --> 00:57:06.473]  Brought to the Japanese embassy in Baghdad.
[00:57:06.873 --> 00:57:10.235]  Arab Satellite News Channel Al Jazeera reported that around 4 p.m., 9 p.m.
[00:57:10.275 --> 00:57:10.875]  Japan time,
[00:57:11.587 --> 00:57:14.108]  We're under the protection of the Islamic Clerics Association.
[00:57:15.049 --> 00:57:15.829]  So that's good news.
[00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:18.831]  Also, hijackers fly a plane into the Pentagon.
[00:57:18.871 --> 00:57:20.631]  No chance at top Pentagon brass.
[00:57:20.732 --> 00:57:21.812]  Unrealistic war game.
[00:57:22.352 --> 00:57:22.933]  Poo-pooed.
[00:57:23.333 --> 00:57:24.914]  That's the headline before 9-11.
[00:57:25.374 --> 00:57:26.534]  Oh, the war games!
[00:57:26.594 --> 00:57:31.677]  They had the war games that no one seemed to know about, that Rice said didn't exist.
[00:57:32.236 --> 00:57:33.016]  So we'll get into that.
[00:57:33.537 --> 00:57:37.299]  Also, really scary article we told you about this years ago, but here it is, Mainstream News.
[00:57:37.679 --> 00:57:42.262]  Information Week, business innovation powered by technology newspaper.
[00:57:43.683 --> 00:57:46.244]  RFID pressed into service for roadway.
[00:57:47.025 --> 00:57:47.205]  The U.S.
[00:57:47.225 --> 00:57:52.368]  Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration is working with four companies to develop new radio frequency identification.
[00:57:53.607 --> 00:58:00.876]  Technology for roadways, official CRFID, is a way to warn drivers, for instance, of impending intersection collisions and vehicle rollovers.
[00:58:00.956 --> 00:58:10.167]  In fact, the National Safety Transportation Group said they want to make you take these, and your car will be controlled by them, and they'll be able to stop your car and control it.
[00:58:11.215 --> 00:58:15.239]  We've already had enough of these computers locking up and causing wrecks, but it doesn't matter.
[00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:16.620]  Total control.
[00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:23.967]  The government and vendors are investigating technology called Dedicated Short-Range Communications, RFID, to try to control you.
[00:58:26.269 --> 00:58:29.032]  CNN chipping away at privacy with radio waves.
[00:58:29.232 --> 00:58:31.774]  Shows a guy self-checkout with the scanners.
[00:58:34.296 --> 00:58:35.838]  It's all coming up after your calls.
[00:58:36.952 --> 00:58:43.199]  The second hour is only a few minutes away, so please stay with us and stop procrastinating.
[00:58:43.820 --> 00:58:44.801]  Get my videos.
[00:58:44.821 --> 00:58:47.024]  They're waking up 90% of those that see them.
[00:58:47.164 --> 00:58:49.567]  Get them and open people's minds.
[00:58:51.633 --> 00:59:00.261]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:59:00.482 --> 00:59:11.772]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, sulfur, odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:59:11.972 --> 00:59:14.615]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:14.955 --> 00:59:21.417]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:59:21.577 --> 00:59:23.458]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:59:23.638 --> 00:59:29.660]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:59:29.920 --> 00:59:35.582]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:59:35.922 --> 00:59:39.825]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:39.865 --> 00:59:40.565]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:59:40.585 --> 00:59:41.646]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:41.806 --> 00:59:42.086]  Big Brother.
[00:59:42.106 --> 00:59:43.207]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:43.267 --> 00:59:44.128]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:44.188 --> 00:59:44.748]  You want answers?
[00:59:44.768 --> 00:59:45.529]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.632 --> 01:00:09.295]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:09.835 --> 01:00:13.938]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:14.138 --> 01:00:18.941]  All right, my friends, now 36 seconds into the second hour.
[01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:34.052]  Of this global transmission against tyranny.
[01:00:34.112 --> 01:00:47.402]  Coming up, I want to go back over in more detail the Lone Gunman episode where the secret government group hijacks the jet, the jumbo jet, to fly to the World Trade Center as a pretext for war and weapon sales.
[01:00:47.943 --> 01:00:56.570]  Because now we've learned of the long-kissed goodnight by big Hollywood production company, Samuel L. Jackson, Gina Davis, put out in 1996.
[01:00:58.761 --> 01:01:10.080]  Where the CIA says that they bombed the World Trade Center the first time was really the FBI in reality, and that they're going to do it again to kill 4,000 people as a pretext to blame the Arabs for weapon sales.
[01:01:10.861 --> 01:01:12.604]  More just blatant flaunting.
[01:01:13.519 --> 01:01:15.200]  And this ties into the real world.
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.721]  Hijackers fly into Pentagon.
[01:01:16.781 --> 01:01:18.282]  No chance, said top brass.
[01:01:18.762 --> 01:01:19.882]  Unrealistic war game.
[01:01:19.942 --> 01:01:20.823]  Poo-pooed before 9-11.
[01:01:20.923 --> 01:01:24.005]  London Guardian, five months before September 11th attacks.
[01:01:24.565 --> 01:01:24.625]  U.S.
[01:01:24.665 --> 01:01:34.650]  military planners suggested a war game to practice a response to a terrorist attack using a commercial airliner flown into the Pentagon, but senior officers rejected the scenario as too unrealistic.
[01:01:35.331 --> 01:01:37.091]  Do your homework, Guardian.
[01:01:37.432 --> 01:01:41.014]  We have the direct link to the Pentagon from November of 2000.
[01:01:42.822 --> 01:01:51.311]  Contingency planning Pentagon mass cow exercise simulate scenarios preparing for emergencies where terrorists hijack a plane and fly to the Pentagon.
[01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:54.334]  Honolisa Rice, we never heard of such a plan.
[01:01:54.714 --> 01:02:04.984]  No, you just ordered the FBI not to stop Al-Qaeda with W199I, which people can go read about from the BBC at prisonplanet.com and infowars.com.
[01:02:05.345 --> 01:02:06.546]  So we'll get to that as well.
[01:02:08.177 --> 01:02:18.763]  WorldNetDaily picks up our story about Applied Digital's global plan to have ID chips under the skin as the global ID number and to make police take it, which has now been in major newspapers.
[01:02:19.823 --> 01:02:21.704]  The Sun, Sentinel, the AP, you name it.
[01:02:22.245 --> 01:02:28.628]  WorldNetDaily took actual quotes off the radio show and didn't give us any credit, so we called them up and they're going to give us credit.
[01:02:28.668 --> 01:02:31.770]  Interesting, I don't particularly even care about the credit, but it's funny they didn't give us that.
[01:02:31.810 --> 01:02:34.111]  They'd give some liberal the credit, but not us.
[01:02:35.014 --> 01:02:36.574]  Because we're real conservatives, I guess.
[01:02:36.594 --> 01:02:37.635]  We're not neocons.
[01:02:37.655 --> 01:02:40.115]  But actually, they said they're going to fix it, so we appreciate that.
[01:02:41.036 --> 01:02:44.697]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls, as promised, and back into all this news.
[01:02:45.297 --> 01:02:47.177]  Michael in North Carolina, go ahead.
[01:02:47.958 --> 01:02:52.179]  Alex, thanks is such a small word for all you do, but I'll say it anyway.
[01:02:52.999 --> 01:02:53.739]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:02:53.759 --> 01:02:54.139]  Go ahead.
[01:02:54.459 --> 01:03:04.002]  Last night on NBC 17 here in North Carolina, I saw a brief video clip of trash men in Scotland, and...
[01:03:04.935 --> 01:03:14.820]  The commentator said that trash is now being scanned by the government in Scotland to monitor what is thrown away by the people there.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:21.964]  And each trash can had a tag on it.
[01:03:22.024 --> 01:03:34.590]  Yeah, and the RFID manufacturers in Walmart and the Defense Department, it's public, from the factory to the warehouse to the store to your home to the landfill, everything you buy is scanned and tracked according to that
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.701]  And that's the plan.
[01:03:37.181 --> 01:03:38.242]  And I heard local news.
[01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:42.246]  They're training the hotel workers how to dig through your stuff and spy on you here in Austin.
[01:03:42.526 --> 01:03:44.888]  You can't even go to a motel or hotel without them spying on you.
[01:03:45.809 --> 01:03:47.611]  And if they don't spy, they'll take their hotel.
[01:03:47.631 --> 01:03:50.573]  So you got a handgun or whatever, which isn't even illegal.
[01:03:50.593 --> 01:03:51.814]  You still get a SWAT team raid.
[01:03:52.555 --> 01:03:53.736]  And this is the new America.
[01:03:54.504 --> 01:04:06.630]  The Soviet states of America, and the same thing's going on in England, the new matrix system, the NSA at the state level is going to spy on your IRS information, your tax records, nothing to do with terror.
[01:04:07.030 --> 01:04:09.311]  You see, the new definition is, we're all terrorists.
[01:04:10.972 --> 01:04:12.812]  What show did you see this on in Scotland?
[01:04:13.253 --> 01:04:15.494]  I saw this on NBC 17.
[01:04:16.694 --> 01:04:18.975]  And of course they said it was wonderful and good, right?
[01:04:19.235 --> 01:04:20.676]  Oh, it's for their own protection, yeah.
[01:04:21.707 --> 01:04:25.149]  Um, and another thing, and I'll take your response off air.
[01:04:25.269 --> 01:04:26.250]  I'll tell you what, just stay there.
[01:04:26.290 --> 01:04:32.213]  I want to hear more about, because I did see an article they were going to do this with trash a few months ago, but I didn't know that it had already begun.
[01:04:32.233 --> 01:04:36.016]  Hey, it's freedom, man, when they read your mail and go through your trash.
[01:04:36.076 --> 01:04:41.018]  I mean, and where the trash men and the cable man and the phone man and everybody spies on you.
[01:04:41.038 --> 01:04:43.340]  I mean, that's what the veterans fight for.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:48.823]  While the border stays wide open, of course, and they don't make the illegals buy the scambit citizens have to.
[01:04:49.163 --> 01:04:49.804]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:49.824 --> 01:04:50.184]  Stay with us.
[01:04:52.918 --> 01:04:55.659]  Do you know there's a price war in the insurance business?
[01:04:55.719 --> 01:04:57.440]  Well, right now, don't wait.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:03.023]  You call Term Busters, and you could save up to 40% on quality term life insurance.
[01:05:03.183 --> 01:05:04.063]  Call now.

[01:05:04.163 --> 01:05:04.203]  800-430-6748.
[01:05:04.343 --> 01:05:05.164]  Here's one example.
[01:05:05.184 --> 01:05:08.565]  A male age 50, non-tobacco, issue preferred, half million dollars of coverage is only $113 a month.
[01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:21.411]  Guaranteed for 20 years.
[01:05:21.711 --> 01:05:28.432]  Call Term Busters to save up to 40% on term life insurance.
[01:05:28.452 --> 01:05:29.412]  800-430-6748.
[01:05:29.432 --> 01:05:31.293]  800-430-6748.
[01:05:31.793 --> 01:05:33.373]  We have smokers rates too.
[01:05:33.654 --> 01:05:37.915]  We specialize in half million dollar and up term life insurance coverage.
[01:05:38.195 --> 01:05:43.936]  Call my friends at Term Busters now to see if you can save up to 40% on term life insurance.
[01:05:44.076 --> 01:05:46.999]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:47.019 --> 01:05:49.742]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.522]  This disaster is a new world order.
[01:06:06.622 --> 01:06:09.365]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:06:09.686 --> 01:06:13.910]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:20.898]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:21.038 --> 01:06:23.040]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:33.825]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:34.025 --> 01:06:39.407]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:06:39.907 --> 01:06:42.569]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:06:42.649 --> 01:06:43.409]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:43.429 --> 01:06:43.929]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:06:43.969 --> 01:06:44.970]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:58.312]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:06:58.652 --> 01:07:02.755]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:07:03.035 --> 01:07:03.596]  We listened.
[01:07:03.896 --> 01:07:08.880]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:09.640]  We listened.
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:13.062]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:07:13.483 --> 01:07:14.023]  We listened.
[01:07:14.483 --> 01:07:18.066]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:07:18.166 --> 01:07:19.187]  We're good to go.
[01:07:44.386 --> 01:07:47.988]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[01:07:48.009 --> 01:07:51.551]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:07:52.752 --> 01:07:57.815]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:07:58.175 --> 01:08:00.517]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:06.080]  All right, Michael.
[01:08:08.322 --> 01:08:09.863]  We're saying that in North Carolina...
[01:08:11.525 --> 01:08:16.810]  He saw an NBC News piece about how they scan your trash and dig through it and use RFID in Scotland.
[01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:18.652]  I'd heard they were planning this.
[01:08:18.672 --> 01:08:19.813]  I didn't know they'd already started it.
[01:08:20.954 --> 01:08:22.696]  Michael, tell us some more about this report.
[01:08:23.516 --> 01:08:25.058]  Order, I never watch TV.
[01:08:25.118 --> 01:08:27.600]  I just cut the TV on to catch the weather.
[01:08:27.981 --> 01:08:32.805]  I know it comes on about 20 minutes after, and there it was, and they were right in the middle of it.
[01:08:32.825 --> 01:08:34.547]  I would give anything if I had it on tape.
[01:08:36.457 --> 01:08:41.320]  I've got a question for you, and I'll take... Well, I mean, go over and describe it to us.
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.541]  What exactly were they saying?
[01:08:42.982 --> 01:08:51.187]  Well, word for word, the best I can remember is they said, now in Scotland, your trash is being scanned.
[01:08:51.307 --> 01:08:55.130]  This allows the government to monitor what you throw away.
[01:08:55.670 --> 01:09:03.796]  And it showed trash men and trash trucks, which I wasn't really familiar with this, but it's very similar to what we have, and each...
[01:09:05.006 --> 01:09:17.649]  Each trash can had a barcode on the side of it, and they showed a meter and a series of numbers that popped up on this meter when they scanned this trash.
[01:09:18.969 --> 01:09:19.809]  That's what I saw.
[01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:22.930]  Okay, go ahead and ask your question, and then I'll get into some RFID.
[01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:23.350]  Go ahead.
[01:09:23.630 --> 01:09:28.771]  I haven't heard you lately on Real Talk Radio, and I've missed John Stadmiller.
[01:09:28.791 --> 01:09:29.391]  They've changed...
[01:09:30.652 --> 01:09:39.740]  Yeah, months ago, before John left the network, I quit doing Real Talk Radio just because I'm too busy making films and doing interviews to do a Saturday show in the middle of the day.
[01:09:39.780 --> 01:09:45.185]  It was just kind of ending my whole weekend, and then John is no longer with this network.
[01:09:45.265 --> 01:09:48.528]  He's still doing his radio show, though.
[01:09:49.028 --> 01:09:53.893]  Yeah, I still catch Real Talk Radio, but I don't know the frequencies he's on.
[01:09:54.697 --> 01:10:03.564]  And since I don't have a computer, it's very hard to research it, but when the two of you were together on Real Talk Radio, you're unstoppable, man.
[01:10:04.645 --> 01:10:05.705]  Well, yeah, it was a good show.
[01:10:05.785 --> 01:10:11.910]  I've got a family life, and I've been working about 16 hours a day, and I've got to have at least a day off.
[01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:13.371]  Are you doing any fishing?
[01:10:14.392 --> 01:10:20.296]  Yeah, I did go fishing in a canoe on Lake Austin a few weeks ago for about six hours, seven hours.
[01:10:20.656 --> 01:10:21.197]  How's your finger?
[01:10:22.233 --> 01:10:22.953]  Oh, it's fine.
[01:10:22.973 --> 01:10:26.214]  Yeah, from when I basically cut it off last year, it's great.
[01:10:26.454 --> 01:10:27.614]  Got the feeling back in it, too.
[01:10:27.954 --> 01:10:32.835]  I'd like to encourage your listeners to support your sponsors and to pray for you every day.
[01:10:33.335 --> 01:10:34.215]  They can't touch that.
[01:10:35.075 --> 01:10:36.476]  Hey, thanks a lot, and I appreciate it.
[01:10:36.516 --> 01:10:37.736]  God bless you, Michael.
[01:10:38.916 --> 01:10:50.418]  Since he raises RFID, Tex Mars in 95 wrote a book called Project Lucid, government program, Project Lucifer.
[01:10:51.407 --> 01:10:54.810]  It's a federal program with a private company, Project Lucifer, folks.
[01:10:56.191 --> 01:10:57.632]  And I'm not joking.
[01:10:58.493 --> 01:10:59.894]  And RFID was in there.
[01:10:59.934 --> 01:11:00.895]  We carry that book.
[01:11:01.696 --> 01:11:03.257]  Written in 95, published in early 96.
[01:11:05.298 --> 01:11:07.740]  Small radio frequency identification chips.
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:13.925]  Now you hear them on the air going, yeah, we're going to put them in the police, put them in the troops, put them in the homeless, put them in the young, put them in the old.
[01:11:14.326 --> 01:11:15.166]  Want to get in the club?
[01:11:15.186 --> 01:11:15.807]  Got to have it.
[01:11:18.576 --> 01:11:24.326]  But Tex got the federal documents of the plan to replace the barcode with this to track and trace everything we do with it.
[01:11:25.869 --> 01:11:28.193]  Then about three, four years ago, USA Today comes out.
[01:11:31.283 --> 01:11:32.323]  Coming up on four years ago.
[01:11:32.363 --> 01:11:33.283]  It says, oh yeah!
[01:11:33.883 --> 01:11:35.524]  RFID is going to replace the barcode.
[01:11:35.544 --> 01:11:37.344]  The Defense Department and Walmart are involved.
[01:11:37.504 --> 01:11:38.284]  MIT developed it.
[01:11:38.864 --> 01:11:42.725]  It's going to track everything you do from the factory to your home and watch what you do.
[01:11:42.785 --> 01:11:48.526]  It will all be part of this control grid to build a psychological database of what you buy and what you do.
[01:11:48.786 --> 01:11:49.626]  It's so wonderful.
[01:11:50.327 --> 01:11:55.848]  Face scanning cameras will scan what you do in the store and then compare what you bring to the register.
[01:11:56.508 --> 01:11:57.968]  That will be uploaded to the government.
[01:11:58.848 --> 01:12:00.569]  Well, now all that's actually being done.
[01:12:00.849 --> 01:12:04.030]  Walmart's been caught doing that with the smart cameras and the rest of it.
[01:12:05.891 --> 01:12:10.853]  And then once the truth comes out from their own industry statements, they try to spin it and go, that's ridiculous.
[01:12:10.893 --> 01:12:16.715]  It's for simply marking pallets and inventory, when their own admitted plans say this.
[01:12:17.335 --> 01:12:27.519]  And then last year in San Francisco, I remember years ago, all over the country at toll roads, it's like a dollar for the whole toll road if you have the RFID tracker, transponder.
[01:12:28.619 --> 01:12:29.760]  If you don't, it ends up being like $5.
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:34.182]  I mean, I've even gotten this on video where they penalize you for not having the chip.
[01:12:35.443 --> 01:12:38.245]  And then once everybody's got the chip, they can just jack up prices again.
[01:12:38.325 --> 01:12:39.945]  But they know how to get you into it.
[01:12:40.066 --> 01:12:45.749]  Oh, you get a huge discount to get into SeaWorld or Six Flags or Busch Gardens if you hand scan.
[01:12:46.629 --> 01:12:48.430]  You know, it's half price if you do.
[01:12:48.870 --> 01:12:50.431]  Oh, next year, everyone has to.
[01:12:50.511 --> 01:12:51.952]  Better go ahead and enroll now.
[01:12:52.873 --> 01:12:54.914]  Okay, well, I won't have price, you know.
[01:12:57.193 --> 01:12:59.994]  Season pass, the same prices as one day pass.
[01:13:00.054 --> 01:13:01.715]  If I get the hand scan, wow, I'll take it.
[01:13:03.715 --> 01:13:04.996]  So this is what they're doing.
[01:13:06.196 --> 01:13:07.616]  This is the public plan.
[01:13:07.656 --> 01:13:08.937]  And where do we get all this?
[01:13:09.017 --> 01:13:15.039]  From industry publications, from technology publications, where they admit what's going on.
[01:13:15.279 --> 01:13:22.581]  Then, when it's in the mainstream newspaper, it's, oh, it's wonderful, it's a conspiracy theory that they say it should track and trace you and tax you.
[01:13:23.482 --> 01:13:24.482]  This is the tactic.
[01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:29.636]  So we just go to the industry newspapers and websites.
[01:13:29.996 --> 01:13:30.876]  Information Week.
[01:13:31.596 --> 01:13:34.837]  RFID pressed into service for roadway safety April 14, 2004.
[01:13:35.637 --> 01:13:37.617]  We just learned of this today.
[01:13:37.637 --> 01:13:38.437]  It came out yesterday.
[01:13:39.397 --> 01:13:44.478]  Now, I remember they took across the Golden Gate Bridge or the other toll roads, and I've been through them.
[01:13:44.838 --> 01:13:47.159]  They're trying to force you to take an RFID now.
[01:13:49.299 --> 01:13:50.539]  They call it a transponder.
[01:13:50.799 --> 01:13:52.160]  It receives and transmits.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:54.720]  It's about the size of a
[01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:56.150]  I don't know.
[01:13:57.090 --> 01:13:57.670]  A dime.
[01:13:59.511 --> 01:14:14.634]  But they found that in San Francisco now, they put up radio scanner readers, and the transponder you get has your name on it, your car license number on it, and so they found out they were tracking people's movements around the city with these, with the radio readers.
[01:14:15.974 --> 01:14:17.734]  And then other cities have started doing this.
[01:14:18.775 --> 01:14:20.875]  So this is the real deal, folks.
[01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:23.769]  And this is the plan.
[01:14:24.270 --> 01:14:27.813]  And the fools at the tollbooth, you'll ask them, you'll say, do you like the tracker chips?
[01:14:27.913 --> 01:14:28.653]  Oh, yes, I love it.
[01:14:28.934 --> 01:14:30.195]  But you're going to lose your job.
[01:14:30.335 --> 01:14:31.636]  And then they go, oh.
[01:14:32.457 --> 01:14:41.685]  In fact, in America, destroyed by design, I drive through Kansas into Oklahoma, and there's this big toll road, and I pull through, and she goes, you don't have KTAG?
[01:14:41.705 --> 01:14:42.306]  And I go, this is a 97.
[01:14:42.766 --> 01:14:45.208]  And I say, no, I don't have KTAG.
[01:14:46.670 --> 01:14:49.192]  And she says, well, you know, it costs you more.
[01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:53.420]  And I pull the camera out, and I say, you know, you're going to lose your job because of this.
[01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:54.300]  She goes, huh?
[01:14:55.141 --> 01:14:56.481]  She goes, well, I love KTEC.
[01:14:56.521 --> 01:15:05.786]  Well, I drove back through there last year visiting Kansas City, and they've shut down all the original toll booths, and there's only toll booths at the start and the end of the toll road.
[01:15:06.926 --> 01:15:12.029]  And then that's just police there, and you just go through, and you get big discounts if you have the tracker chip.
[01:15:13.049 --> 01:15:13.830]  Well, listen to this.
[01:15:14.784 --> 01:15:19.627]  The government and vendors are investigating technology called dedicated short-range communications.
[01:15:21.388 --> 01:15:21.728]  The U.S.
[01:15:21.768 --> 01:15:28.733]  Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration is working with four companies to develop new radio frequency identification technology for roadways.
[01:15:28.833 --> 01:15:29.894]  Develop new?
[01:15:31.775 --> 01:15:33.816]  It's at least seven, eight years old.
[01:15:34.336 --> 01:15:39.840]  Official CRFID is a way to warn drivers of, for instance, impending intersection collisions.
[01:15:40.863 --> 01:15:43.044]  And vehicle rollovers.
[01:15:43.345 --> 01:15:46.486]  So, isn't that just precious?
[01:15:47.727 --> 01:15:54.051]  Specifically, the government and vendors are investigating technology called Dedicated Short Range Communications, which is related to RFID.
[01:15:54.111 --> 01:16:01.415]  The vendors are Mark 4 Industries, Raytheon, Syrit, and Transcor.
[01:16:02.035 --> 01:16:06.217]  All the big Halliburton division power law group companies.
[01:16:06.698 --> 01:16:08.799]  And they set the agenda, make you buy their product.
[01:16:09.346 --> 01:16:15.511]  A prototype system co-developed by the quartet is expected to be ready for testing in about 18 months.
[01:16:15.531 --> 01:16:21.836]  The Federal Communications Commission has assigned a block of high bandwidth radio spectrum for dedicated communications products.
[01:16:24.378 --> 01:16:21.836]  5.850.
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:27.580]  That's interesting.
[01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:28.201]  And 5.925.
[01:16:29.161 --> 01:16:32.304]  That was my old shortwave frequency.
[01:16:32.984 --> 01:16:33.725]  That's real nice.
[01:16:34.698 --> 01:16:36.859]  Are you focused on wireless?
[01:16:36.899 --> 01:16:39.301]  Then you need to bookmark our mobile pipeline.
[01:16:39.321 --> 01:16:40.181]  So you can click there.
[01:16:42.502 --> 01:16:49.626]  Folks, they just passed a federal transportation bill where they can make all the roads tollways.
[01:16:51.327 --> 01:16:54.069]  The National Seatbelt Initiative passed in 98.
[01:16:54.729 --> 01:16:59.331]  Billions of dollars a year of funding are going to build hardened checkpoints that double as toll roads.
[01:16:59.391 --> 01:17:00.332]  I said this in Police State 2000.
[01:17:00.372 --> 01:17:00.752]  I made 99 people.
[01:17:03.550 --> 01:17:04.651]  I had the federal plan then.
[01:17:04.711 --> 01:17:05.912]  Now it's been expanded.
[01:17:06.692 --> 01:17:08.113]  Everything will be taxed, traced.
[01:17:08.914 --> 01:17:24.363]  The new compulsory volunteers, the new national draft, will wear gray uniforms, will man the checkpoints, entering cities, leaving cities, entering states, leaving states, regional checkpoints, toll roads.
[01:17:24.784 --> 01:17:26.165]  All vehicles will be searched.
[01:17:26.265 --> 01:17:29.647]  Giant x-ray machines will x-ray your car as you drive under it.
[01:17:30.425 --> 01:17:38.191]  You'll have to get out and walk through a system that creates a biometric 360 degree digital image of your naked body.
[01:17:38.211 --> 01:17:38.932]  This is admitted.
[01:17:39.312 --> 01:17:43.775]  NASA brain scanners already in five airports are going to be deployed to scan your brains.
[01:17:44.075 --> 01:17:46.697]  That'll be probable cause if it shows that you're agitated.
[01:17:47.058 --> 01:17:48.319]  Oh, you must be a terrorist.
[01:17:48.399 --> 01:17:57.425]  Folks, this is like the most... If I was a Hollywood producer and five years ago I made a Hollywood film where all this was happening, no one would believe it.
[01:17:57.445 --> 01:17:59.547]  It's much worse than Minority Report.
[01:18:01.190 --> 01:18:10.436]  You know, minus the psychic creatures in the movie, everything else is real and is being done.
[01:18:10.756 --> 01:18:21.463]  The retina scanning, advertising tailored to you, secret police everywhere, being arrested for statistical analysis showing you might commit a crime.
[01:18:22.043 --> 01:18:26.066]  This is all being done, run by convicted felons like Admiral Poindexter.
[01:18:28.032 --> 01:18:29.933]  And so, this is the system.
[01:18:30.173 --> 01:18:31.794]  Satellite trackers in your car.
[01:18:32.455 --> 01:18:33.716]  The control console.
[01:18:34.196 --> 01:18:35.397]  RFID tracking you.
[01:18:35.657 --> 01:18:37.438]  Total taxation and regulation.
[01:18:37.738 --> 01:18:38.599]  I hope you enjoy it.
[01:18:39.039 --> 01:18:41.160]  Or you can get up and say no to all this now.
[01:18:41.701 --> 01:18:43.942]  And form organizations and start educating people.
[01:18:46.024 --> 01:18:50.286]  And I tell you, we'll come back and talk to Joanne, Don, Danny, and others.
[01:18:51.287 --> 01:18:53.148]  I could have spent all day just on this one article.
[01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:57.351]  Here's CNN chipping away at privacy with radio waves.
[01:18:58.246 --> 01:19:04.567]  Privacy advocates are alarmed by a new technology that might be able to monitor even the tiniest aspects of our lives.
[01:19:04.647 --> 01:19:08.108]  It comes in the form of radio frequency identification chips.
[01:19:08.508 --> 01:19:11.989]  Shows an old man at a self-pay checkout system.
[01:19:12.529 --> 01:19:14.670]  You scan, where they're now putting in thumb scanners.
[01:19:15.010 --> 01:19:20.071]  First they train you on the self-serve, then they take out all the clerks, then they make you thumb scan.
[01:19:20.411 --> 01:19:24.092]  You've got a problem, a security guard calls the police and they ask if you're a terrorist.
[01:19:24.512 --> 01:19:25.832]  This is already happening, by the way.
[01:19:26.935 --> 01:19:29.317]  If you complain about the electronic voting, they call the police.
[01:19:29.617 --> 01:19:31.819]  If you complain about the U-scans, the police show up.
[01:19:32.019 --> 01:19:32.580]  What's your problem?
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:33.321]  Who you with?
[01:19:33.581 --> 01:19:34.401]  You part of the extremists?
[01:19:34.822 --> 01:19:39.306]  Well, no, I was just wondering why this system, why there's no more clerks here, why the thumb scanners are here.
[01:19:39.926 --> 01:19:41.868]  We can arrest you right now, you get out of the store.
[01:19:41.888 --> 01:19:43.109]  They're banned from the store.
[01:19:43.489 --> 01:19:44.170]  I just want food.
[01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:45.251]  Yes.
[01:19:46.331 --> 01:19:47.452]  In a few years, they'll tell you.
[01:19:47.793 --> 01:19:49.734]  You don't submit, no buying food.
[01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:50.135]  See?
[01:19:53.050 --> 01:19:56.311]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:19:56.371 --> 01:20:00.552]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:20:00.813 --> 01:20:03.593]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:20:03.794 --> 01:20:06.194]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:20:06.374 --> 01:20:15.017]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:20:15.217 --> 01:20:16.578]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:20:16.758 --> 01:20:20.879]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:20:20.919 --> 01:20:21.680]  Not yet available?
[01:20:52.880 --> 01:20:55.261]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:20:55.502 --> 01:20:59.324]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:20:59.664 --> 01:21:00.484]  Read the labels.
[01:21:00.904 --> 01:21:05.027]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:21:05.247 --> 01:21:09.429]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:21:09.809 --> 01:21:14.692]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:21:15.072 --> 01:21:18.654]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:21:18.835 --> 01:21:24.178]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:21:24.458 --> 01:21:27.200]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:28.381]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:21:52.119 --> 01:21:53.079]  Is America bankrupt?
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:55.801]  Are we on the verge of an all-out economic collapse?
[01:21:56.121 --> 01:21:58.582]  What can be done to protect your family and assets?
[01:21:58.822 --> 01:22:01.883]  What kinds of investments will be able to withstand an economic meltdown?
[01:22:02.023 --> 01:22:04.564]  The problem is it's not always easy to find great solutions.
[01:22:04.704 --> 01:22:08.366]  And during these dangerous economic times, finding the right solution is crucial.
[01:22:08.566 --> 01:22:14.989]  Midas Resources has been a leader in educating people not only about the shaky economic future and its many problems, but also the solutions.

[01:22:20.711 --> 01:22:21.251]  We're good to go.
[01:22:50.691 --> 01:22:51.335]  You'll be glad you did.
[01:22:52.176 --> 01:23:00.602]  Folks, the future of gardening is upon us, and whether you grow for fun, food, or profit, you'll discover great new ways to reap more rewards from everything you grow at futuregarden.com.
[01:23:00.902 --> 01:23:02.003]  Want a jump start on spring?
[01:23:02.263 --> 01:23:08.887]  Bring the power of the summer sun indoors and get your favorite seedlings off to a healthy start with a high-intensity grow light from futuregarden.com.
[01:23:09.027 --> 01:23:15.652]  When the outdoor season winds down, put your high-intensity grow light back to work to serve up fresh-grown produce for prize-winning orchids in the dead of winter.
[01:23:15.872 --> 01:23:16.893]  Short on time or space?
[01:23:17.153 --> 01:23:20.995]  Now you can grow twice as much in half the space without mess or back-breaking work.
[01:23:21.155 --> 01:23:21.996]  Think smart garden.
[01:23:22.296 --> 01:23:22.816]  We're good to go.
[01:23:57.930 --> 01:23:59.851]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:24:00.331 --> 01:24:03.151]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:24:06.212 --> 01:24:17.955]  The globalists are masters of putting in a technology, getting us all addicted to it, then putting a bunch of strings and big brother attachments to it.
[01:24:18.896 --> 01:24:19.776]  Take cell phones.
[01:24:20.376 --> 01:24:21.496]  Incredibly convenient.
[01:24:22.697 --> 01:24:24.277]  Everybody gets addicted to having them.
[01:24:24.972 --> 01:24:36.081]  Then they passed a law in 96 that on October 1st, 2001, all new cell phones had to have a satellite tracker chip in them that triangulates down to 15 feet where you're at.
[01:24:36.961 --> 01:24:39.963]  The new phones allow them to listen to you even when the power is off.
[01:24:40.004 --> 01:24:40.964]  This is mainstream news.
[01:24:41.044 --> 01:24:42.045]  It's in Matrix of Evil.
[01:24:44.547 --> 01:24:46.649]  Now, I have a five-year-old phone here.
[01:24:47.069 --> 01:24:49.351]  And in a few years, I won't be able to get cell phone service.
[01:24:49.391 --> 01:24:50.151]  I use the old phone.
[01:24:50.171 --> 01:24:51.012]  It actually works better.
[01:24:52.530 --> 01:24:57.654]  But the point is, is that then I won't be able to have a cell phone, see, because the technology won't be offered without it.
[01:24:58.815 --> 01:25:05.861]  All the new cars for eight years have a satellite tracker plug-in with a little $50 unit, $25 to $50 unit that's going to be plugged in.
[01:25:05.981 --> 01:25:08.723]  Oregon and other states are about to announce satellite tracking and taxation.
[01:25:08.984 --> 01:25:10.865]  Well, they have announced they want to do it, and the feds are pushing it.
[01:25:11.766 --> 01:25:17.411]  It's the same thing with radio frequency identification, the checkpoints they're going to build that are, quote, toll roads where you also get searched.
[01:25:18.362 --> 01:25:19.623]  The RFID, all of it.
[01:25:19.643 --> 01:25:20.324]  They just do it.
[01:25:20.344 --> 01:25:22.285]  They just say, you want to buy anything, you've got to do it.
[01:25:22.605 --> 01:25:24.567]  Well, we don't offer bagging and groceries.
[01:25:24.607 --> 01:25:26.228]  You do it, and you've got a thumb scan.
[01:25:26.288 --> 01:25:27.149]  Well, I want food.
[01:25:27.509 --> 01:25:28.330]  Well, sorry.
[01:25:29.170 --> 01:25:31.572]  You know, the last store in town put it in.
[01:25:31.592 --> 01:25:32.213]  You've got to do it.
[01:25:32.913 --> 01:25:34.014]  And this is the plan.
[01:25:34.054 --> 01:25:35.035]  This is what they're doing.
[01:25:35.415 --> 01:25:36.476]  This is happening.
[01:25:37.643 --> 01:25:38.023]  Okay?
[01:25:38.083 --> 01:25:39.124]  I mean, this is admitted.
[01:25:39.164 --> 01:25:40.185]  This is not our opinion.
[01:25:40.225 --> 01:25:43.348]  Now they're saying, the entire Italian government's going to have to have chips.
[01:25:43.788 --> 01:25:46.030]  The entire military's going to have to have chips in America.
[01:25:46.270 --> 01:25:47.931]  We want police to all have chips.
[01:25:48.212 --> 01:25:51.174]  Well, if you want to own a gun, there's a move to make you have a chip in your hand.
[01:25:52.055 --> 01:25:53.936]  I mean, they're actually in the news.
[01:25:54.697 --> 01:25:55.698]  It's really going on.
[01:25:55.718 --> 01:25:56.478]  It's really happening.
[01:25:58.280 --> 01:26:00.481]  And they just say, well, if you want to drive a car, you've got to do this.
[01:26:00.542 --> 01:26:02.223]  Well, if you want to have a cell phone, that's what's in it.
[01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:05.712]  They're designing the infrastructure where you cannot escape it.
[01:26:06.193 --> 01:26:07.814]  You better get involved now, people.
[01:26:07.854 --> 01:26:08.735]  This is very serious.
[01:26:09.115 --> 01:26:10.376]  Joanne in Colorado.
[01:26:10.456 --> 01:26:11.277]  Joanne, go ahead.
[01:26:11.798 --> 01:26:13.439]  Yes, I don't have a cell phone.
[01:26:13.459 --> 01:26:14.420]  I don't care to have one.
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:18.583]  But anyhow, the gentleman that was on Coast to Coast was a Rupert, a Michael Rupert.
[01:26:18.603 --> 01:26:19.524]  Yeah, I know who he is.
[01:26:19.604 --> 01:26:20.845]  Okay.
[01:26:21.045 --> 01:26:25.829]  And they did come on with that emergency thing where they say if this has been a real emergency.
[01:26:25.869 --> 01:26:29.032]  They've come on twice on Coast to Coast last night.
[01:26:30.337 --> 01:26:31.358]  A couple of things.
[01:26:31.698 --> 01:26:40.144]  I'm asking people to call Peter Boyles, Mike Gallagher, and some of the radio stations.
[01:26:40.384 --> 01:26:42.045]  The ultra left-wing programs?
[01:26:42.285 --> 01:26:42.566]  Yeah.
[01:26:43.927 --> 01:26:49.610]  I called Peter Boyles the other day, and I told him about the chip, how we're being watched.
[01:26:50.070 --> 01:26:51.331]  And it doesn't exist, right?
[01:26:51.471 --> 01:26:51.851]  Oh, right.
[01:26:51.991 --> 01:26:53.692]  Well, it's in 100 newspapers still.
[01:26:54.012 --> 01:26:57.574]  Now, if you said you loved it, they would have said, oh, yes, it exists, it's good.
[01:26:57.594 --> 01:26:59.875]  But when you say you don't like it, it doesn't exist.
[01:27:00.255 --> 01:27:00.495]  Right.
[01:27:01.076 --> 01:27:05.478]  So anyhow, after I got off, a gentleman called because I mentioned Art Bell.
[01:27:05.958 --> 01:27:07.919]  They wouldn't let me give your 800 number.
[01:27:07.939 --> 01:27:10.060]  I did get your 800 number to Gallagher.
[01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:12.121]  Well, he really let you give it out?
[01:27:13.542 --> 01:27:14.342]  I gave it to the girl.
[01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:15.423]  Whether she gave it to him... Oh, no.
[01:27:15.443 --> 01:27:17.224]  You've got to just blurt websites out on air.
[01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:18.986]  They'll never let you give out a phone number.
[01:27:19.626 --> 01:27:19.887]  Okay.
[01:27:20.227 --> 01:27:22.409]  But anyhow... I don't expect them to, by the way.
[01:27:22.569 --> 01:27:24.070]  Because her whole show would just turn into that.
[01:27:24.150 --> 01:27:24.610]  But go ahead.
[01:27:24.730 --> 01:27:25.671]  Art Bell was a joke.
[01:27:25.751 --> 01:27:26.492]  I was a joke.
[01:27:26.612 --> 01:27:32.357]  The gentleman called right after me and said, Oh, he says, Yeah, I have an Art Bell shirt.
[01:27:32.397 --> 01:27:37.561]  And Peter Boyle says, Yeah, but what if some of the things she says are true?
[01:27:37.581 --> 01:27:40.883]  And it's like, you know, they play their dumb little games.
[01:27:40.983 --> 01:27:41.524]  Want me to...
[01:27:42.211 --> 01:27:45.794]  Exactly where I heard how the chip was put in.
[01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:46.514]  Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:27:46.534 --> 01:27:48.416]  Where did you hear of this, you crazy?
[01:27:48.456 --> 01:27:50.357]  Well, it's been on every TV show in the country.
[01:27:50.617 --> 01:27:50.898]  Right.
[01:27:51.278 --> 01:27:56.862]  But it's amazing because I listened afterwards and, you know, they just had their stupid play games with the...
[01:27:57.805 --> 01:28:01.108]  Well, it's like Limbaugh saying the CFR doesn't exist, the U.N.
[01:28:01.128 --> 01:28:04.311]  didn't take it over to the Supreme Court, skull and bones doesn't exist.
[01:28:04.331 --> 01:28:09.735]  I mean, it's in all the papers, in your face, but still, when you don't like it, it doesn't exist.
[01:28:09.835 --> 01:28:18.943]  Right, and I saw one of the black cars that's supposed to be Homeland Security run by supposedly retired policemen with the dog in the back.
[01:28:19.643 --> 01:28:26.089]  This policeman had their window down where a kid could have stuck their hand in and got their hand bit off and
[01:28:26.624 --> 01:28:30.226]  He says, oh, well, as you can see, no one's going to come close to my car.
[01:28:30.246 --> 01:28:36.490]  Well, if you bark, if you yell back at one of those dogs and they bark at you, you get assaulted by police and put in prison.
[01:28:36.510 --> 01:28:37.110]  Thanks for the call.
[01:28:37.130 --> 01:28:38.371]  There's been a bunch of cases of that.
[01:28:38.391 --> 01:28:41.053]  Well, this is quite a phenomenon.
[01:28:41.073 --> 01:28:43.954]  You call into a neocon show and you go, the Patriot Act is taking our freedoms.
[01:28:44.395 --> 01:28:45.395]  Oh, tell me one example.
[01:28:45.475 --> 01:28:46.076]  Oh, you can't.
[01:28:46.176 --> 01:28:46.456]  Click.
[01:28:47.145 --> 01:28:49.169]  Or they'll get somebody on who isn't articulate.
[01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:50.912]  I mean, that's the trick to get on these shows.
[01:28:50.952 --> 01:28:52.835]  Call up and go, I don't like the government.
[01:28:53.095 --> 01:28:54.257]  It's corrupt patriotic.
[01:28:54.297 --> 01:28:55.439]  They go, what example do you have?
[01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:56.481]  I've actually done this.
[01:28:56.862 --> 01:28:57.382]  I don't know.
[01:28:57.402 --> 01:28:58.625]  Oh, we'll get you right on.
[01:28:58.785 --> 01:28:59.626]  We'll get you right on.
[01:28:59.827 --> 01:29:00.488]  You call up and go.
[01:29:01.232 --> 01:29:10.461]  Well, the Las Vegas Review-Journal, dated January 2nd, 2004, reported that they're arresting county commissioners and topless bar owners under the Patriot Act.
[01:29:10.941 --> 01:29:16.966]  And the Associated Press reported they went after someone for an ounce of marijuana, and he got 20 years in prison under the Patriot Act.
[01:29:17.227 --> 01:29:20.670]  And let me give you... I'm sorry, we're not going to let you come on right now.
[01:29:20.690 --> 01:29:21.771]  Well, why not?
[01:29:21.811 --> 01:29:22.732]  Well, it's just my choice.
[01:29:23.664 --> 01:29:24.205]  Call up and go.
[01:29:24.845 --> 01:29:28.248]  Uh, uh, I don't think the government's good.
[01:29:28.268 --> 01:29:30.309]  Uh, uh, uh.
[01:29:31.150 --> 01:29:32.671]  Oh, sir, let us get you right on.
[01:29:33.291 --> 01:29:34.732]  Oh, oh, please don't hang up.
[01:29:34.752 --> 01:29:36.454]  We're going to be right on the break here in a minute.
[01:29:36.474 --> 01:29:38.175]  You'll go to the front of the line.
[01:29:43.519 --> 01:29:44.440]  We're on the march.
[01:29:44.920 --> 01:29:46.541]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.442 --> 01:29:50.124]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:53.306 --> 01:29:55.267]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:29:55.347 --> 01:30:06.070]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light's Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:06.430 --> 01:30:10.971]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.031 --> 01:30:22.354]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:22.754 --> 01:30:23.415]  We're good to go.
[01:30:38.092 --> 01:30:44.854]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.054 --> 01:30:48.656]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:48.896 --> 01:30:49.696]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:31:01.225]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:31:01.665 --> 01:31:05.888]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:31:06.129 --> 01:31:13.174]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:31:13.555 --> 01:31:19.660]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:21.021]  There are no side effects.
[01:31:21.161 --> 01:31:23.242]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[01:31:38.130 --> 01:31:41.212]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[01:31:41.232 --> 01:31:41.272]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.292 --> 01:31:41.392]  866-885-6625.
[01:31:41.412 --> 01:31:42.573]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[01:31:42.593 --> 01:31:42.793]  Call today.
[01:31:53.715 --> 01:31:54.716]  It's finally here.
[01:31:54.856 --> 01:31:55.837]  Spring has arrived.
[01:31:56.017 --> 01:31:58.980]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:02.643]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:32:02.863 --> 01:32:11.030]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:32:11.290 --> 01:32:15.033]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:32:15.234 --> 01:32:20.238]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[01:32:20.518 --> 01:32:25.020]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:29.281]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[01:32:29.361 --> 01:32:36.504]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[01:32:36.804 --> 01:32:37.604]  We're good to go.
[01:33:03.702 --> 01:33:11.768]  I've been on socialist and conservative clothing neocon broadcast quite a few times, and I'll mention that Bush is going to sign the assailants ban.
[01:33:12.088 --> 01:33:13.929]  They'll call me a liar, say that isn't true.
[01:33:13.969 --> 01:33:15.570]  I'll say that Bush is for open borders.
[01:33:15.891 --> 01:33:16.931]  They'll try to deny that.
[01:33:17.552 --> 01:33:21.495]  Just a year ago, they denied Skull and Bones even existed when I had hundreds of newspaper articles.
[01:33:22.142 --> 01:33:24.986]  And video of satanic rituals they've done that the New York Observer got.
[01:33:25.707 --> 01:33:33.236]  But this is the tactic, and I'm serious, because when I go on road trips, I will just the whole time sit there calling into national talk shows.
[01:33:34.871 --> 01:33:36.732]  And other local neocon shows.
[01:33:36.852 --> 01:33:41.035]  And if you call in and sound focused and go, you know, Bush isn't a real conservative.
[01:33:41.095 --> 01:33:42.456]  And I mean on topic.
[01:33:43.016 --> 01:33:47.319]  What they're talking about, they'll go, sorry, we're not looking for that opinion right now.
[01:33:47.439 --> 01:33:48.580]  We've got some other callers.
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:50.321]  Well, why are you hanging up on me?
[01:33:50.341 --> 01:33:51.482]  Well, it's my decision.
[01:33:51.962 --> 01:33:52.902]  They're all trained the same.
[01:33:53.303 --> 01:33:59.507]  But if you call up and go, I don't like Bush and Big Brother losing freedom.
[01:34:00.666 --> 01:34:02.948]  I mean, literally, and they'll go, I mean, it's the same thing.
[01:34:03.068 --> 01:34:04.249]  Oh, we'll get you right on.
[01:34:04.309 --> 01:34:05.009]  We'll get you right on.
[01:34:05.029 --> 01:34:05.950]  Well, thank you.
[01:34:06.650 --> 01:34:12.575]  And then I get on the air, and I go, let me tell you, and I'll just start hitting them hard, and the host will go, you know, you acted like somebody else.
[01:34:12.595 --> 01:34:13.275]  You're a liar.
[01:34:13.315 --> 01:34:14.176]  You're dishonest.
[01:34:14.696 --> 01:34:18.419]  That was a stage seminar call, a liberal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:34:19.419 --> 01:34:25.203]  And then I've heard people call in and go, you know, Bush is really the liberal, big government, we're losing our freedoms, Bush and Kerry are cousins.
[01:34:26.104 --> 01:34:27.285]  Oh, you're a lying liberal.
[01:34:27.325 --> 01:34:28.546]  That's a seminar call.
[01:34:29.443 --> 01:34:31.928]  When they're the seminar, when they're the liberals.
[01:34:31.948 --> 01:34:33.291]  You understand how this works?
[01:34:34.474 --> 01:34:37.219]  So, if you want to get through on these shows, call in.
[01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:44.912]  You know, act real emotional and stupid and just go, I just, we're losing everything, I just, and then have your facts right there.
[01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:47.452]  Once you get on, hit them hard and they go, what's your facts?
[01:34:47.532 --> 01:34:49.333]  Show me one example of the Patriot Act.
[01:34:49.533 --> 01:34:50.693]  And then just rattle them off.
[01:34:51.153 --> 01:34:56.194]  Just rattle them off at them and they'll just, ah, ah, ah.
[01:34:56.834 --> 01:34:57.414]  It's incredible.
[01:34:57.775 --> 01:35:03.676]  Let's just ram through four or five calls and I've got these audio clips of video I want to air.
[01:35:04.554 --> 01:35:06.575]  Very interesting stuff coming up from the Long Kiss.
[01:35:06.615 --> 01:35:07.055]  Good night.
[01:35:07.195 --> 01:35:08.216]  Just stay with us for that.
[01:35:09.016 --> 01:35:11.577]  Right now, let's go to Don in Pennsylvania.
[01:35:11.617 --> 01:35:12.358]  Don, go ahead.
[01:35:12.378 --> 01:35:13.338]  Hi, Alex.
[01:35:13.358 --> 01:35:14.259]  How are you doing?
[01:35:14.419 --> 01:35:14.879]  Fine, sir.
[01:35:15.219 --> 01:35:20.241]  I was listening to your show, Believe It or Not, in Youngstown, Ohio, there last night, WKBN.
[01:35:21.042 --> 01:35:28.185]  And I thought your hosts there were quite gracious as far as not shutting you up and leaving you do your thing after you hung up.
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:32.842]  Out of all the callers, I'd have to say one out of five had something negative towards you.
[01:35:32.882 --> 01:35:39.186]  The other four or five were all pretty much positive as far as you having a different idea.
[01:35:39.206 --> 01:35:44.589]  I got a little extra mad yesterday because I was in an irritable mood.
[01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:50.493]  I do interviews three or four times a day, and I was on that show for an hour.
[01:35:51.534 --> 01:35:57.939]  Well, like I said, four out of five actually said, you know, he might sound a little bit obnoxious, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:35:57.979 --> 01:36:01.021]  Of course, you got a little bit hyper, as one person said it.
[01:36:01.041 --> 01:36:05.244]  But four out of five were definitely on your side.
[01:36:21.505 --> 01:36:29.534]  And I even called up, and if anyone from Youngstown or the surrounding area, call that radio station up and tell them to get them on the AM side because...
[01:36:30.436 --> 01:36:32.297]  I think we need a lot more of that around here.
[01:36:32.637 --> 01:36:35.539]  Yeah, they need to kick Michael Savage off and put me on at night.
[01:36:35.959 --> 01:36:39.321]  You notice he was trying to laugh about generals calling for Marshall Lawman.
[01:36:39.361 --> 01:36:41.683]  I said, wait, you have Savage on your station.
[01:36:41.903 --> 01:36:43.824]  He calls for concentration camps every night.
[01:36:44.044 --> 01:36:48.627]  And that host shut up real quick, because anybody who's heard it once has heard him say that.
[01:36:49.087 --> 01:36:51.689]  Yes, and as far as the RFP... Well, let me stop you.
[01:36:51.789 --> 01:36:57.292]  Have you heard Savage say that if you disagree with the government, that aids the terrorist, puts you in a forced labor camp?
[01:36:58.032 --> 01:36:59.492]  Oh, he's already said that.
[01:36:59.532 --> 01:37:00.793]  We want you in a federal prison.
[01:37:01.593 --> 01:37:02.773]  He's already said that part.
[01:37:02.873 --> 01:37:04.434]  He says forced labor camp.
[01:37:04.454 --> 01:37:05.534]  I've heard it 15 times.
[01:37:06.354 --> 01:37:06.834]  At least.
[01:37:07.534 --> 01:37:11.175]  And as far as the RFD chips, I have my own little trucking company.
[01:37:11.875 --> 01:37:13.856]  And, yeah, we got RFD chips.
[01:37:13.876 --> 01:37:15.636]  They're tracking us all over the country now.
[01:37:16.597 --> 01:37:18.757]  Yeah, you got to put them in the trucks and they track you.
[01:37:18.797 --> 01:37:20.118]  But people will still deny.
[01:37:20.198 --> 01:37:22.798]  Look, I was sitting there telling the host.
[01:37:22.898 --> 01:37:25.599]  I said millions of children have been brain damaged from MMR.
[01:37:26.949 --> 01:37:29.133]  The CDC's own documents just got released.
[01:37:29.193 --> 01:37:30.975]  It's on ABC News on my website.
[01:37:31.376 --> 01:37:33.039]  And the CDC says, we don't care.
[01:37:33.059 --> 01:37:34.000]  We're going to keep doing it.
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:35.142]  We've got to cover this up.
[01:37:35.903 --> 01:37:37.406]  And that's their own documents.
[01:37:37.466 --> 01:37:41.832]  That shows the government will kill 3,000 people with the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
[01:37:42.253 --> 01:37:47.197]  You know, if they'll brain damage millions, kill thousands, and the host just said, well, I don't believe it.
[01:37:47.398 --> 01:37:48.218]  I can't believe it.
[01:37:48.398 --> 01:37:51.121]  Well, we had black people as slaves in this country.
[01:37:51.361 --> 01:37:52.942]  We killed the Native Americans.
[01:37:53.323 --> 01:37:54.384]  I love America.
[01:37:54.444 --> 01:37:55.785]  America's better than all the rest.
[01:37:56.005 --> 01:37:58.627]  But stop denying that government kills people.
[01:37:58.948 --> 01:38:02.310]  Stop denying that government's the most dangerous thing in history.
[01:38:02.471 --> 01:38:03.852]  You naive idiots.
[01:38:04.052 --> 01:38:04.833]  You see what I'm saying?
[01:38:05.013 --> 01:38:06.034]  Why I got so angry?
[01:38:06.614 --> 01:38:08.795]  Oh, I totally agree with you.
[01:38:09.135 --> 01:38:14.976]  If you'd like, I could give you the phone number over the air of if anyone else wishes to call that radio station and have them plug in there.
[01:38:15.256 --> 01:38:17.697]  My heavens, I already called six times yesterday and today.
[01:38:18.057 --> 01:38:19.237]  Is that a clear channel station?
[01:38:19.257 --> 01:38:19.877]  Yes, it is.
[01:38:20.077 --> 01:38:20.717]  You can forget it.
[01:38:20.877 --> 01:38:21.477]  You can forget it.
[01:38:22.058 --> 01:38:22.798]  Well, I tried.
[01:38:22.818 --> 01:38:23.618]  Well, no, no.
[01:38:23.658 --> 01:38:26.238]  I mean, just mom and pops privately owned.
[01:38:26.258 --> 01:38:27.059]  They'll put us on.
[01:38:27.079 --> 01:38:29.359]  The CIA's... I'm just joking.
[01:38:29.619 --> 01:38:30.980]  I mean, the globalists aren't going to put us on.
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:32.760]  Well, I tried, Alex, so...
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:34.821]  All right, that's all I can say.
[01:38:34.841 --> 01:38:35.921]  Okay, well, I appreciate it, buddy.
[01:38:36.341 --> 01:38:37.141]  Good to hear from you.
[01:38:38.802 --> 01:38:39.522]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:38:39.782 --> 01:38:41.543]  Let's talk to Danny in Ohio.
[01:38:41.583 --> 01:38:42.323]  Danny, go ahead.
[01:38:43.143 --> 01:38:50.385]  Okay, Alex, this guy must be psychic because I listen to 1500 AM, and I'm from Ohio.
[01:38:50.785 --> 01:38:53.846]  But all I wanted to tell you was I'm 10 years old, right?
[01:38:54.787 --> 01:38:58.788]  And at my school, they have barbed wires.
[01:38:59.224 --> 01:39:00.165]  Yeah, and do they frisk you?
[01:39:00.205 --> 01:39:01.105]  Do you have ID cards?
[01:39:01.185 --> 01:39:02.006]  No, we don't have ID cards.
[01:39:02.026 --> 01:39:03.066]  Not yet, but it's just...
[01:39:25.386 --> 01:39:28.149]  The teachers, they bring you down in your spirit.
[01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:30.572]  They make sure that they bring you down.
[01:39:31.473 --> 01:39:34.336]  Ma'am, do the doors automatically lock when you're in class?
[01:39:35.557 --> 01:39:35.737]  No.
[01:39:35.757 --> 01:39:40.522]  Because a lot of schools are actually turning into grade A prisons, medium security prisons.
[01:39:40.983 --> 01:39:42.905]  So you don't have drug dogs and police in the school?
[01:39:42.925 --> 01:39:43.746]  No, no.
[01:39:44.126 --> 01:39:46.369]  They're not looking for the CIA drugs they brought in?
[01:39:46.429 --> 01:39:46.589]  Okay.
[01:39:47.273 --> 01:39:49.615]  Well, it sounds like your school's in about medium grade.
[01:39:50.015 --> 01:40:07.588]  Thousands of school districts, no food without thumb scanning, RFID badges and barcodes, daily searches, barbed wire facing in, automatic locking doors, tattletale programs for a full semester in the seventh grade with BATF writing dossiers on your parents.
[01:40:07.608 --> 01:40:08.729]  What do you think of that?
[01:40:08.749 --> 01:40:11.131]  I think it's a trip.
[01:40:12.232 --> 01:40:13.853]  How long have you been listening to the show?
[01:40:16.626 --> 01:40:24.933]  I've been listening all day.
[01:40:24.953 --> 01:40:26.354]  Okay.
[01:40:27.395 --> 01:40:29.617]  How are you listening to it?
[01:40:30.258 --> 01:40:31.138]  I have my mom.
[01:40:31.339 --> 01:40:32.419]  She has a radio.
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:42.428]  But it's like when one day we were saying the Pledge of Allegiance and I was tying my shoes and I didn't get to say it, so the teacher got mad at me.
[01:40:42.873 --> 01:40:46.736]  And she made me write the Pledge of Allegiance, and she gave me a detention for it.
[01:40:47.577 --> 01:40:51.681]  All right, well, it's good to have you on board, and God bless you, and thanks for being aware, and you've got a good mother.
[01:40:52.602 --> 01:40:53.162]  God bless her.
[01:40:53.562 --> 01:40:55.304]  Let me say this about the Pledge of Allegiance.
[01:40:57.226 --> 01:41:08.115]  We didn't have the Pledge of Allegiance until about 100 years ago, less than 100 years ago, and a major socialist newspaper put it out as part of a flag-selling program.
[01:41:08.496 --> 01:41:09.817]  I've read the articles on air.
[01:41:10.746 --> 01:41:13.667]  And I know you're going to go, oh, you're a liberal, you're against it.
[01:41:14.067 --> 01:41:18.668]  You understand that's why they have the liberals come out against it to then make you go get behind it.
[01:41:18.688 --> 01:41:19.909]  That's part of the dialectic.
[01:41:20.369 --> 01:41:25.650]  And I'm not saying it's bad to pledge allegiance to the flag and a one nation under God, indivisible liberty, justice for all.
[01:41:26.110 --> 01:41:32.312]  The point is that you shouldn't have to do it because America is about freedom.
[01:41:33.552 --> 01:41:36.453]  And I just want you to know that it came from socialists.
[01:41:37.516 --> 01:41:38.998]  I mean, I can dig this back out.
[01:41:39.038 --> 01:41:40.379]  Derry Brownfield's talked about it, too.
[01:41:40.959 --> 01:41:45.403]  And the whole pledge and all of that was actually pushed by the Socialist Party here in the U.S.
[01:41:45.664 --> 01:41:47.946]  to get us used to worshipping the government.
[01:41:48.006 --> 01:41:48.967]  And it's very dangerous.
[01:41:49.287 --> 01:41:50.988]  Flag worship of any type is dangerous.
[01:41:51.028 --> 01:41:52.089]  Hitler was big into it.
[01:41:52.690 --> 01:41:53.891]  And I love the Stars and Stripes.
[01:41:53.931 --> 01:41:57.554]  I don't think the flag's bad because a lot of evil people have used it for their banner.
[01:41:58.335 --> 01:41:59.436]  I love America, but...
[01:42:00.369 --> 01:42:08.811]  But the flag symbolizes your rights, and those rights are dying, and those that are destroying your freedoms have expropriated our flag.
[01:42:09.551 --> 01:42:11.392]  And you do need to know the origin.
[01:42:11.412 --> 01:42:13.392]  I think the encyclopedia has it in it, too.
[01:42:13.592 --> 01:42:18.634]  You might find out the origin of the Pledge of Allegiance and find out what's going on there.
[01:42:19.414 --> 01:42:20.814]  Pledging allegiance to the flag?
[01:42:20.834 --> 01:42:25.675]  I thought you were supposed to pledge allegiance to God and to your country.
[01:42:26.075 --> 01:42:28.116]  But certainly to the flag?
[01:42:30.248 --> 01:42:32.050]  Just history, folks.
[01:42:32.810 --> 01:42:34.532]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:42:35.433 --> 01:42:37.676]  Let's talk to Roger in Pennsylvania.
[01:42:37.696 --> 01:42:39.818]  A lot of calls from Pennsylvania and Ohio today.
[01:42:39.918 --> 01:42:40.679]  Roger, go ahead.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:42.281]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:42:42.321 --> 01:42:46.746]  Of course, the pledge was modified to add under God to it.
[01:42:47.815 --> 01:42:50.156]  Well, that was good, but that was done by conservatives later.
[01:42:50.676 --> 01:42:55.558]  But the original pledge, and I can dig it out, was put out by the Socialist Party.
[01:42:55.598 --> 01:42:55.958]  Go ahead.
[01:42:56.178 --> 01:43:02.761]  Yeah, and of course the only remaining anti-constitutional heresy in there, which I refuse to say, is indivisible.
[01:43:04.415 --> 01:43:06.477]  That was a... Well, explain what that means.
[01:43:06.577 --> 01:43:21.350]  Well, that was also Abraham Lincoln's heresy, that the nation could not be divided, even though it's in, like, Texas' state constitution, that they can back out of the... Well, it's in New Hampshire's Article 10 right to revolt, and the states work in loose confederation.
[01:43:21.651 --> 01:43:26.575]  And it's against, of course, the Declaration of Independence as well, which is also a seminal document, but...
[01:43:26.997 --> 01:43:32.602]  The reason I called... Oh, and by the way, another trick on the little... I think there's another trick they do.
[01:43:33.022 --> 01:43:44.371]  You notice, I think this is a nationwide phenomenon on these big talk shows, is that they have the time hate delay airing of the shows.
[01:43:44.471 --> 01:43:48.014]  So, you know, it'll be at midnight a show that's actually on 10 in the morning or something.
[01:43:48.655 --> 01:43:54.900]  And I think basically what they do is they keep it live in the safe markets where they don't get the contentious calls.
[01:43:55.549 --> 01:43:59.933]  And then they re-air it and the others, and there's just like no way you're going to call in unless you call off hour.
[01:44:00.354 --> 01:44:00.694]  I don't know.
[01:44:00.734 --> 01:44:02.896]  I think that's just program directors plugging stuff in.
[01:44:02.936 --> 01:44:10.103]  Yeah, but the real reason I called was, I know you covered this, but I think you might have missed this one part that is about Hamid Chalabi.
[01:44:10.563 --> 01:44:12.025]  That is Bush's hand-picked talk.
[01:44:12.045 --> 01:44:19.612]  The convicted bank robber of $300 million, the torture master for the Shah, who tortured men, women, and children to death, who runs things for Halliburton.
[01:44:20.143 --> 01:44:24.889]  Yeah, and of course, now the administration's hand-picked puppet to head rack right now.
[01:44:24.909 --> 01:44:25.990]  Well, that's a point I want to make.
[01:44:26.010 --> 01:44:27.792]  Everybody keeps going, democracy, democracy.
[01:44:27.832 --> 01:44:29.755]  We're about to give them their own government in June.
[01:44:29.775 --> 01:44:38.065]  Folks, our government, well, the private corporations, James Baker and others who are running all this, their private cash machine.
[01:44:38.982 --> 01:44:44.905]  They appointed 324 to 326, I forget, 320-plus people.
[01:44:45.005 --> 01:44:45.805]  They appoint them.
[01:44:46.165 --> 01:44:50.347]  Now they are going to appoint other people, and they call that an election.
[01:44:50.527 --> 01:44:53.748]  They call that the handover of power, and our troops are going to stay.
[01:44:53.908 --> 01:45:00.371]  I mean, so now our definition of democracy is the empire appointing regional governors.
[01:45:00.871 --> 01:45:02.952]  Now here's the part I think you might have missed.
[01:45:03.092 --> 01:45:03.812]  It surprised me.
[01:45:03.832 --> 01:45:07.494]  This was on the Sunday morning with Tim Russert, I guess, the blathering heads.
[01:45:08.337 --> 01:45:24.165]  And he actually had in there about how virtually the sole, only single source for Bush's weapons of mass deception was Chalabi's very close relative working up these fanciful tales.
[01:45:24.926 --> 01:45:34.871]  And then apparently some reporter called Chalabi on it, and his response was, well, I think we should just look to the future and not dwell on the past.
[01:45:34.951 --> 01:45:37.192]  That was his answer to these Cook stories.
[01:45:37.737 --> 01:45:46.560]  And all I can say is I hope that sells as well in Iraq where his countrymen are getting blown to bits as it does to us stupid Americans.
[01:45:47.761 --> 01:45:48.681]  Hey, I appreciate the call.
[01:45:48.701 --> 01:45:49.481]  Let me just say this.
[01:45:50.722 --> 01:45:58.564]  Secretary of the Army White, who I'm no fan of, of Enron scamming fame with fake computers for the legislature of California to look at.
[01:45:58.584 --> 01:45:59.785]  Oh, look at our trading system.
[01:45:59.805 --> 01:46:00.585]  It's real good.
[01:46:01.665 --> 01:46:04.066]  He did say it's going to take 300,000 to 400,000 troops.
[01:46:04.506 --> 01:46:05.747]  Top generals said that.
[01:46:06.354 --> 01:46:10.515]  Former Marine Corps Commandant said that, and we're called liberals by the neocons.
[01:46:11.975 --> 01:46:16.616]  So, I mean, if you're going to go have this illegal war and do all this, you needed at least double the troops.
[01:46:16.756 --> 01:46:17.957]  And now you've seen what's happened.
[01:46:19.057 --> 01:46:22.318]  And so right there is an impeachable offense.
[01:46:23.738 --> 01:46:27.079]  So, the politicians running the wars, just like Vietnam.
[01:46:27.859 --> 01:46:30.540]  I mean, if you're going to send our troops off, give them the tools they need.
[01:46:30.780 --> 01:46:33.000]  But, of course, you don't, because you hate their guts.
[01:46:34.101 --> 01:46:34.881]  This is so sick.
[01:46:36.863 --> 01:46:39.304]  Tell you what, we'll get to all the other calls here in just a few minutes.
[01:46:39.384 --> 01:46:52.332]  I wanted to air this, and again, this is from Gina Davis and Samuel L. Jackson, Big Hollywood Movie, The Long Kiss Goodnight, 1986, action film, provides yet more anecdotal evidence of government complicity in 9-11.
[01:46:54.102 --> 01:47:05.446]  In a similar vein of the episodes The Lone Gunman aired on Fox in March 2001, the action film The Long Kiss Goodnight proves yet more revelations of the method of government complicity in attacks on the World Trade Center.
[01:47:05.846 --> 01:47:16.949]  The clip features of the page not only hints at government complicity in terror attacks in order to increase budgets, spending, and ratcheting control, but it also names the World Trade Center as the target.
[01:47:17.489 --> 01:47:23.011]  Referring to the 93 bombing of the Trade Center, Samuel L. Jackson's character is told that the CIA were complicit in the bombing.
[01:47:23.502 --> 01:47:24.503]  This is almost accurate.
[01:47:24.523 --> 01:47:26.764]  It was in fact the FBI who were complicit in the bombing.
[01:47:27.104 --> 01:47:40.492]  The character is often told in explicit detail by the shadowy government official that 4,000 people will be killed in a fake terrorist event on American soil in order to get some money out of Congress, and of course the event will be, quote, blamed on Muslims naturally.
[01:47:41.133 --> 01:47:53.020]  Not only is the 4,000 eerily accurate, the clip virtually mirrors the Lone Gunman episode where the shadowy government official tells the hero that a large-scale fake terror attack will be carried out to create mass fear and total government control.
[01:47:53.823 --> 01:47:56.785]  Let's go ahead and air the Long Kiss Goodnight piece first.
[01:47:57.566 --> 01:47:58.307]  Go ahead and hit that.
[01:47:58.627 --> 01:48:01.690]  Is there a fundraiser?
[01:48:01.710 --> 01:48:01.690]  1993.
[01:48:03.231 --> 01:48:05.292]  World Trade Center bombing, remember?
[01:48:07.634 --> 01:48:11.538]  During the trial, one of the bombers claimed the CIA had advanced knowledge.
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:17.463]  The diplomat who issued the terrorist visa was CIA.
[01:48:18.829 --> 01:48:24.111]  It's not unthinkable they paved the way for the bombing, purely to justify a budget increase.
[01:48:24.691 --> 01:48:29.253]  You're telling me that you're going to fake some terrorist thing just to get some money out of Congress?
[01:48:29.313 --> 01:48:33.495]  Well, unfortunately, Mr. Hennessy, I have no idea how to fake killing 4,000 people.
[01:48:35.016 --> 01:48:36.616]  So we're just going to have to do it for real.
[01:48:38.297 --> 01:48:41.138]  Don't blame it on the Muslims, naturally.
[01:48:41.238 --> 01:48:42.339]  Then I get my funding.
[01:48:43.559 --> 01:48:44.260]  Good night, old girl.
[01:48:46.120 --> 01:48:47.701]  Timothy, I'll be in shop for one night.
[01:48:49.338 --> 01:48:50.599]  Alright.
[01:48:51.099 --> 01:48:54.701]  Go ahead and hit the first Lone Gunman clip now where they talk about the same thing.
[01:48:54.741 --> 01:48:55.102]  Go ahead.
[01:48:56.703 --> 01:48:57.803]  Scenario 12D.
[01:49:00.665 --> 01:49:05.328]  We know it's a war game scenario and it has to do with airline counter-terrorism.
[01:49:06.729 --> 01:49:08.109]  Why is it important enough to kill for?
[01:49:08.890 --> 01:49:10.251]  Because it's no longer a game.
[01:49:12.512 --> 01:49:18.836]  If some terrorist group wants to act out this scenario, why target you for assassinations?
[01:49:19.229 --> 01:49:20.889]  Depends on who your terrorists are.
[01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:24.571]  The men who conceived of it in the first place.
[01:49:27.091 --> 01:49:30.692]  You're saying our government plans to commit a terrorist act against a domestic heirloom?
[01:49:30.712 --> 01:49:31.152]  There you go!
[01:49:31.533 --> 01:49:33.253]  Indicting the entire government, as usual.
[01:49:33.273 --> 01:49:34.453]  It's a faction.
[01:49:34.753 --> 01:49:35.994]  A small faction.
[01:49:36.014 --> 01:49:36.994]  What possible gain?
[01:49:38.014 --> 01:49:39.515]  The Cold War's over, John.
[01:49:40.215 --> 01:49:43.256]  But with no clear enemy to stoppile against the arms market's flat.
[01:49:43.903 --> 01:49:55.976]  But bring down a fully loaded 727 into the middle of New York City, and you'll find a dozen tin-pot dictators all over the world just clamoring to take responsibility and begging to be smart-bombed.
[01:49:56.457 --> 01:49:56.977]  I can't believe it.
[01:49:57.298 --> 01:49:58.899]  This is about increasing our sales.
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:00.061]  Okay.
[01:50:01.562 --> 01:50:03.945]  Now, then in the next clip, the one where we get back...
[01:50:05.487 --> 01:50:10.251]  They found the planes being flown by remote control by the government to be flown to the World Trade Center full of passengers.
[01:50:10.611 --> 01:50:16.957]  Now, from our inside Pentagon sources, this has all been confirmed, they had nerve gas on board that killed everybody after takeoff.
[01:50:17.477 --> 01:50:20.220]  Then remote control took control and they flew them into the structures.
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:23.643]  Then you have a few fake cell phone calls to people.
[01:50:23.663 --> 01:50:27.766]  You cover up the FAA tower tapes and all that.
[01:50:28.847 --> 01:50:32.070]  And again, this is a government that's been caught creating all this false evidence in the past.
[01:50:32.773 --> 01:50:38.639]  You know, they can show you Forrest Gump shaking hands with Kennedy in Forrest Gump, so don't tell me they don't fake this.
[01:50:38.659 --> 01:50:40.020]  They fake Bin Laden tapes.
[01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:40.901]  That's admitted.
[01:50:41.982 --> 01:50:46.466]  The hijackers, most of them are still alive, by the way, and they're all CIA.
[01:50:47.647 --> 01:50:49.749]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with more.
[01:50:54.033 --> 01:50:56.896]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:50:57.689 --> 01:50:58.310]  We're good to go.
[01:51:12.469 --> 01:51:13.950]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:33.102]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.

[01:53:56.405 --> 01:53:59.267]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:54:00.648 --> 01:54:03.651]  Crashing to the lives of disinformation.
[01:54:04.171 --> 01:54:06.833]  Exposing neocon traitors and their liberal accomplices.
[01:54:08.135 --> 01:54:08.816]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:54:08.856 --> 01:54:21.566]  By the way, instead of just airing these clips of, you know, flaunting their plans in our faces, hijackers flying to Pentagon, no chance, said top brass, unrealistic war game, poo-pooed, before 9-11 is the London Guardian headline.
[01:54:21.966 --> 01:54:23.908]  Five months before September 11th attacks, U.S.
[01:54:23.928 --> 01:54:33.756]  military planners suggested a war game to practice a response to a terrorist attack using a commercial airliner flown to the Pentagon, but senior officers rejected the scenario as too unrealistic.
[01:54:35.312 --> 01:54:38.015]  Yeah, your own men were getting wind of what was happening.
[01:54:38.035 --> 01:54:39.076]  We're trying to protect people.
[01:54:39.096 --> 01:54:41.318]  But you shut that down, didn't you, General Myers?
[01:54:41.778 --> 01:54:43.700]  You've been well rewarded from NORAD.
[01:54:44.341 --> 01:54:47.884]  Details emerged yesterday in an email leaked to the Public Policy Watchdog Group.
[01:54:47.904 --> 01:54:53.369]  In the email, written a week after the attacks, a special operations officer discussed the exercise with his colleagues.
[01:54:54.002 --> 01:55:01.988]  Details of the exercise, codenamed Positive Force, and the rejected hijacking scenario were confirmed by NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command.
[01:55:02.428 --> 01:55:03.269]  Forget that!
[01:55:03.469 --> 01:55:07.092]  I've got the direct link to the Military District of Washington.
[01:55:07.972 --> 01:55:11.615]  By the way, they even have a video of where the plane crashes into the Pentagon.
[01:55:11.635 --> 01:55:13.857]  Not video, a whole mock city built where they did this.
[01:55:36.698 --> 01:55:38.900]  But the government never heard of such a plan.
[01:55:39.260 --> 01:55:40.622]  Go ahead and hit that next clip.
[01:55:40.642 --> 01:55:48.790]  This is from a lone gunman where they find out that they're remote controlling the plane, and they've been killing people by remote controlling their cars, which they're already doing, by the way.
[01:55:49.871 --> 01:55:52.734]  And then they find out, oh, it's flying into the World Trade Center.
[01:55:52.754 --> 01:55:53.094]  Go ahead.
[01:55:54.428 --> 01:55:55.068]  Did you find anything?
[01:55:55.248 --> 01:55:56.329]  You know, the luggage hold's clear.
[01:55:56.349 --> 01:55:57.249]  This thing can be toasted.
[01:55:57.269 --> 01:55:59.250]  But you don't make it with your erector, sir.
[01:55:59.270 --> 01:56:01.832]  You're absolutely sure that this is the targeted flight?
[01:56:02.092 --> 01:56:04.613]  This flight was chosen primarily for its visibility.
[01:56:05.093 --> 01:56:07.394]  It's scheduled to pass on the hadnontary to Boston.
[01:56:10.116 --> 01:56:13.777]  You said they intend to bring us down in the middle of New York City?
[01:56:15.718 --> 01:56:16.619]  What if there is no bomb?
[01:56:18.860 --> 01:56:19.920]  Well, how are they gonna bring it down?
[01:56:21.241 --> 01:56:22.862]  Same way a dead man can drop a car.
[01:56:28.041 --> 01:56:29.101]  What do you mean, no Bob?
[01:56:29.121 --> 01:56:35.784]  Langley, I need you to hack into the aircraft's onboard navigation system.
[01:56:38.104 --> 01:56:39.405]  We need to know where we're headed.
[01:56:39.425 --> 01:56:40.325]  Okay, go into headsets.
[01:56:40.345 --> 01:56:41.305]  I'll call in the Air Force carrier.
[01:56:41.325 --> 01:56:42.526]  I think we're sending a ground air fax.
[01:56:42.566 --> 01:56:43.326]  That's one twisted star 69.
[01:56:43.446 --> 01:56:45.567]  Well, just get ready to ride the wave, hippie boy.
[01:56:45.587 --> 01:56:47.687]  Just get me on that plane and I'll get you autopilot access.
[01:56:47.747 --> 01:56:48.908]  How are you going to do that?
[01:56:49.148 --> 01:56:52.589]  Airline telemetry systems use processors similar to those found in CB radios.
[01:56:53.789 --> 01:56:53.989]  I'm in.
[01:56:54.009 --> 01:56:55.570]  We got ourselves a convoy.
[01:56:56.588 --> 01:56:57.229]  What's your progress?
[01:56:57.549 --> 01:56:59.470]  I've hacked into the flight control system output.
[01:56:59.670 --> 01:57:00.771]  You want that little bit of help?
[01:57:00.891 --> 01:57:03.233]  It's what the brains of the plane is telling the little black box.
[01:57:03.273 --> 01:57:06.475]  Force heading, attitude, hold, yaw, axis, stabilization, what?
[01:57:07.095 --> 01:57:07.235]  What?
[01:57:08.656 --> 01:57:09.317]  What the heck's that?
[01:57:09.897 --> 01:57:10.678]  Is that what it looks like?
[01:57:12.799 --> 01:57:13.760]  I think it is what it looks like.
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:14.500]  But there's what?
[01:57:14.881 --> 01:57:15.081]  Like?
[01:57:15.101 --> 01:57:16.382]  Autom protocol.
[01:57:16.842 --> 01:57:17.623]  Remote access.
[01:57:17.663 --> 01:57:19.184]  Somebody on the ground is flying your plane.
[01:57:19.984 --> 01:57:20.485]  Hold you, sir.
[01:57:20.865 --> 01:57:21.605]  Keep your course.
[01:57:26.468 --> 01:57:30.271]  We need to know our flight plan.
[01:57:30.331 --> 01:57:34.655]  I'm mapping the data now.
[01:57:35.175 --> 01:57:36.116]  Fires.
[01:57:36.136 --> 01:57:42.942]  Your flight's going to make an unscheduled stop in exactly 22 minutes.
[01:57:43.002 --> 01:57:47.265]  The corner of Liberty and Washington.
[01:57:48.266 --> 01:57:49.727]  Lower Manhattan.
[01:57:49.747 --> 01:57:50.588]  World Trade Center.
[01:57:50.608 --> 01:57:53.470]  I'm going to crash the plane into the World Trade Center.
[01:57:54.131 --> 01:57:54.411]  All right.
[01:57:54.431 --> 01:57:55.392]  I'll tell the flight crew.
[01:57:56.966 --> 01:57:58.607]  All right, folks, so there you have it.
[01:57:59.087 --> 01:58:05.270]  Oh, and the movie, you know, it takes off from Boston, and just, you know, it's the same thing, but that's for TV.
[01:58:05.950 --> 01:58:08.671]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[01:58:08.731 --> 01:58:10.953]  I've made ten films, written a book, published a book.
[01:58:11.033 --> 01:58:12.373]  You need to get these books and videos.
[01:58:12.393 --> 01:58:13.794]  You need to make copies of them.
[01:58:14.234 --> 01:58:16.715]  Like, the future of the country depends on it, because it does.
[01:58:17.035 --> 01:58:20.337]  For the best videos for waking people up, toll-free number to order.
[01:58:20.657 --> 01:58:25.701]  1-888-253-3139 if you want to get involved and do something and support this broadcast.
[01:58:25.721 --> 01:58:27.183]  1-888-253-3139 or prisonplanet.com or infowars.com to order.
[01:58:27.203 --> 01:58:28.424]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:58:28.444 --> 01:58:29.405]  Your call is lots of news.
[01:58:43.576 --> 01:58:47.017]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:58:47.318 --> 01:58:50.819]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:58:50.899 --> 01:58:54.841]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:58:55.061 --> 01:59:01.223]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:59:01.624 --> 01:59:09.547]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:59:09.947 --> 01:59:15.311]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:59:15.471 --> 01:59:19.234]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:59:19.594 --> 01:59:21.436]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:59:21.516 --> 01:59:23.678]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:59:23.938 --> 01:59:28.861]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[01:59:28.901 --> 01:59:34.646]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:59:37.848 --> 01:59:41.691]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[01:59:49.576 --> 01:59:50.257]  Big Brother.
[01:59:50.897 --> 01:59:51.978]  Mainstream media.
[01:59:52.658 --> 01:59:53.799]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:53.819 --> 01:59:55.300]  You want answers?
[01:59:55.981 --> 01:59:56.901]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.562 --> 02:00:01.425]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:01.745 --> 02:00:05.828]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:07.556 --> 02:00:10.499]  All right, into Trace Hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:00:11.219 --> 02:00:14.061]  Hour number three, coming to you from Austin, Texas.
[02:00:14.602 --> 02:00:15.382]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:00:15.442 --> 02:00:16.063]  I love freedom.
[02:00:16.143 --> 02:00:16.783]  I hate tyranny.
[02:00:16.823 --> 02:00:18.345]  I'm not your slave, New World Order.
[02:00:20.146 --> 02:00:21.667]  Wide open phones in this third hour.
[02:00:21.747 --> 02:00:22.988]  We'll get to your calls a little bit quicker.
[02:00:23.008 --> 02:00:24.149]  We did a decent job today of that.
[02:00:24.189 --> 02:00:24.389]  But 1-800-259-9231.
[02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:37.247]  I want to talk about the Pentagon officers wanting to do drills of planes flying into buildings and the Pentagon brass blocking them.
[02:00:37.268 --> 02:00:41.651]  I want to get into the Iraq situation.
[02:00:41.671 --> 02:00:44.094]  I want to get into the RFID tracker system.
[02:00:44.754 --> 02:00:48.377]  Have you seen the Vanity Fair hit piece on myself and Paul Joseph Watson?
[02:00:48.397 --> 02:00:48.998]  What do you think of that?
[02:00:50.498 --> 02:00:54.082]  When do you think the globalists are going to blow some more stuff up to blame it on their enemies?
[02:00:54.502 --> 02:01:07.316]  What do you think of the long kiss goodnight with Samuel L. Jackson and Geena Davis where the secret government group wants to blow up the World Trade Center again to kill, they said, 4,000 people as a pretext for arms sales and to attack the Muslims?
[02:01:08.457 --> 02:01:10.179]  Man, everybody knew about this, didn't they?
[02:01:11.836 --> 02:01:13.257]  Maybe it's all coincidence.
[02:01:13.317 --> 02:01:19.262]  Maybe the New York lottery on the one-year anniversary of 9-11 coming up 9-11 was an accident.
[02:01:19.542 --> 02:01:24.066]  Maybe the Chicago mercantile on the one-year anniversary coming up 9-11 was an accident.
[02:01:24.926 --> 02:01:32.032]  Maybe the Pentagon document, Northwoods, calling for hijacking jets by remote control and crashing them as a pretext for war.
[02:01:32.412 --> 02:01:34.114]  Maybe we should just ignore that.
[02:01:34.174 --> 02:01:38.237]  Maybe Condoleezza Rice calling public officials, telling them not to fly to New York that day.
[02:01:38.537 --> 02:01:39.678]  Maybe that's not important.
[02:01:40.894 --> 02:01:42.035]  Maybe none of this is important.
[02:01:42.055 --> 02:01:45.777]  Maybe the FBI being ordered not to stop al-Qaeda isn't important.
[02:01:45.797 --> 02:01:46.718]  What do you think of all this?
[02:01:47.538 --> 02:01:48.859]  Let's go ahead and go to the calls.
[02:01:48.959 --> 02:01:56.423]  Let's talk to, I was about to go to Dave, but he hung up, so let's go to Vince in Indiana, then Jason, Terry, Mike, Clint, and others.
[02:01:57.084 --> 02:01:57.864]  Vince, go ahead.
[02:01:57.884 --> 02:01:59.405]  Hello, Mr. Jones.
[02:01:59.485 --> 02:02:00.226]  How are you?
[02:02:00.506 --> 02:02:01.166]  I'm doing okay.
[02:02:01.806 --> 02:02:04.328]  Listen, you were talking about RFID chips.
[02:02:04.972 --> 02:02:06.852]  And how they have them in computers and all that?
[02:02:07.092 --> 02:02:08.153]  Well, not in computers.
[02:02:09.113 --> 02:02:13.333]  They're going in the cars to track and trace us on the highways and to watch what we buy and sell.
[02:02:13.553 --> 02:02:22.235]  Here's how these work, because the chips that they're going to put in, they're putting them in now, in your ranges and stoves and washer and dryers.
[02:02:22.435 --> 02:02:23.275]  Here's how this works.
[02:02:23.335 --> 02:02:34.337]  I know quite a bit about computers and programming, but they can, even though you turn them off at night and disconnect them and take them out of their sockets,
[02:02:35.836 --> 02:02:56.028]  He said here, and I'm telling you right now from systems and industry publications, that the means of observing a system can be reconstructed on another computer when you plug them back in because they have these continuous running scripts with these barcodes and how they scan.
[02:02:56.048 --> 02:03:02.272]  The barcode scanning is a continuous running script in the computer itself.
[02:03:03.001 --> 02:03:09.524]  That the radio frequency can be recorded, reconstructed at another later time of day.
[02:03:09.544 --> 02:03:11.065]  Well, that's what they do with RFID.
[02:03:11.085 --> 02:03:11.865]  That's the whole point.
[02:03:11.985 --> 02:03:18.388]  Oh, yeah, that's the whole point, and people don't understand it, even though they think they turn them off, unplug them, and plug them back in.
[02:03:18.408 --> 02:03:25.511]  Hey, Vince, here's CNN today, chipping away at privacy with radio waves that shows an old man in a self-checkout system.
[02:03:26.295 --> 02:03:31.980]  And it says, privacy advocates are alarmed by new technology that might be able to monitor even the tiniest aspects of our lives.
[02:03:32.380 --> 02:03:34.262]  The government says this is the plan.
[02:03:35.763 --> 02:03:37.265]  Oh, yeah, this is their plan.
[02:03:37.765 --> 02:03:43.570]  Well, I just read the Technology Week article where they're going to make us use these in our cars.
[02:03:43.630 --> 02:03:44.451]  This is the plan.
[02:03:44.471 --> 02:03:48.395]  Oh, yeah, and I'm going to tell you the other plans that are going to come up after the election.
[02:03:48.875 --> 02:03:53.319]  There's going to be probably a 3% to 4% interest rate increases.
[02:03:54.096 --> 02:03:58.637]  Well, that's what happens.
[02:03:58.657 --> 02:04:04.759]  They've cut the federal tax, and they're exploding the state taxes under federal direction at every level.
[02:04:05.219 --> 02:04:07.660]  I know people whose homes have actually gone down in value.
[02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:12.281]  They can't sell them, but they'll give them a 300% increase in a single year.
[02:04:12.341 --> 02:04:13.181]  That's conservative.
[02:04:14.421 --> 02:04:17.742]  And then they'll tell you on the news, we only had a 1% increase this year.
[02:04:17.822 --> 02:04:18.883]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:04:19.203 --> 02:04:19.603]  I know.
[02:04:20.023 --> 02:04:20.523]  It's awful.
[02:04:21.664 --> 02:04:22.745]  Thanks for the call, Vance.
[02:04:23.446 --> 02:04:26.189]  Jason and Terry and Mike and Clint and everybody else, 1-800-259-9231.
[02:04:26.449 --> 02:04:31.595]  Hey, if you disagree with me, give me a call.
[02:04:31.615 --> 02:04:32.656]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:04:32.736 --> 02:04:42.107]  Got a bunch of other news in Iraq as well coming up, but first-year calls are always quite interesting.
[02:04:46.084 --> 02:04:48.126]  Who says MREs are only for emergencies?
[02:04:48.306 --> 02:04:49.947]  Certainly not the Long Life Food Depot.
[02:04:50.087 --> 02:04:58.073]  The Long Life Food Depot, with over 20 years of continuous service, has been a primary supplier of MREs to hikers, campers, and hunters, as well as FEMA and the Red Cross.
[02:04:58.313 --> 02:05:04.738]  Imagine hot turkey and potatoes, beef teriyaki, or cheese tortellini, followed by peaches, mixed fruit, or pineapple for dessert.
[02:05:04.918 --> 02:05:06.179]  Just a few of the many selections.
[02:05:06.379 --> 02:05:09.721]  Visit www.longlifefood.com for a complete menu.
[02:05:09.901 --> 02:05:13.484]  Both FEMA and the Red Cross have suggested having food stored in case of disasters.
[02:05:13.684 --> 02:05:14.505]  We're good to go.
[02:05:42.287 --> 02:05:43.949]  Call the Long Life Food Depot today.
[02:05:44.890 --> 02:05:49.235]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:05:49.435 --> 02:05:53.860]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:05:58.385]  There is a chance to use this disaster as a New World Order.
[02:05:58.425 --> 02:05:59.766]  The New World Order.
[02:06:01.549 --> 02:06:05.774]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:06:05.834 --> 02:06:12.762]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act Legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:06:12.902 --> 02:06:14.925]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:06:15.265 --> 02:06:25.630]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:06:25.890 --> 02:06:31.233]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:07:49.651 --> 02:07:50.291]  Big Brother.
[02:07:50.951 --> 02:07:52.032]  Mainstream media.
[02:07:52.732 --> 02:07:53.852]  Government cover-ups.
[02:07:53.872 --> 02:07:55.313]  You want answers?
[02:07:56.053 --> 02:07:56.994]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:57.634 --> 02:08:01.335]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:01.795 --> 02:08:05.937]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:06.057 --> 02:08:19.121]  We're on the AM and FM dial from Los Angeles, California to Providence, Rhode Island.
[02:08:21.101 --> 02:08:33.006]  But we learn of new affiliates all the time, and I wish Affiliate Relations would have told me about this, but it's great to be on in Youngstown, Ohio, 1500 AM WASN.
[02:08:33.347 --> 02:08:34.167]  Hope I'm getting that right.
[02:08:34.187 --> 02:08:39.189]  We've got a bunch of callers who are calling in very excited, and so that's wonderful.
[02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:45.872]  And I just want to thank all of the affiliates to pick up the show, because this show is scary.
[02:08:45.892 --> 02:08:49.294]  What we talk about is frightening, but it's true.
[02:08:50.325 --> 02:08:57.208]  All we're doing is saying the world is round when the world itself, the population, has been trying to say it's flat.
[02:08:59.109 --> 02:09:03.851]  I mean, I'm on record a long time ago telling you everything that was going to happen.
[02:09:03.931 --> 02:09:05.492]  And people say, man, are you psychic?
[02:09:05.532 --> 02:09:06.212]  How did you know this?
[02:09:06.913 --> 02:09:08.533]  All I did was read government documents.
[02:09:08.714 --> 02:09:15.897]  All I did was read Army War College white papers and Council on Foreign Relations think tank battle plans.
[02:09:17.859 --> 02:09:29.962]  And later in this hour, I thought about this earlier, later in this third hour, I want to just in about five, ten minutes, give you a preview of what life will be like in five years.
[02:09:31.063 --> 02:09:32.983]  A conservative preview.
[02:09:33.864 --> 02:09:40.245]  And you just stick a tape in, you just burn a CD of this, and five years from now, you go back and you listen to it.
[02:09:41.246 --> 02:09:42.146]  And I've done this before.
[02:09:43.732 --> 02:09:47.313]  And again, it's because I study what the globalists are up to, what their plans are.
[02:09:47.433 --> 02:09:52.295]  I'm not just magically coming up with all of this.
[02:09:52.375 --> 02:09:53.255]  Let me give you an example.
[02:09:55.656 --> 02:10:06.460]  I remember in 2000 seeing the Army War College say that they wanted to condition the public, they even talked about how they'd sell it to us, to take trackable chips under the skin of the entire population.
[02:10:07.740 --> 02:10:12.022]  And so I went on air with that declassified document and warned people.
[02:10:13.115 --> 02:10:14.436]  And boy, I was the weirdo.
[02:10:16.477 --> 02:10:33.750]  And then suddenly, right after 9-11, all over television, when we've got this feeling of national fear and concern, there's this big kidnapping epidemic, which actually the number of kidnappings is way down, but man, you'd think thousands of children were being grabbed a month.
[02:10:35.991 --> 02:10:42.496]  And then suddenly the answer was, Verichip, Applied Digital Solution, we all need implantable chips.
[02:10:44.304 --> 02:10:47.846]  Now, the industry has just sat back and let Verichip take the lead.
[02:10:48.366 --> 02:10:54.369]  IBM, Motorola, they're all developing much more advanced tracker biochips.
[02:10:54.389 --> 02:10:58.450]  But Applied Digital is kind of the front company for all of this.
[02:11:01.312 --> 02:11:08.395]  And when they have that big blitz on every news channel, the implanting of that family who turned out were stockholders and worked for the company,
[02:11:09.662 --> 02:11:11.263]  Their stock actually took a nosedive.
[02:11:11.503 --> 02:11:14.024]  People found out that they owned some of that stock and said, I don't want to be involved with that.
[02:11:14.064 --> 02:11:14.925]  I'm dumping the stock.
[02:11:15.245 --> 02:11:17.706]  It's wildly unpopular with the general public.
[02:11:18.466 --> 02:11:22.428]  In major polls, something like 95% of people are against having a chip put in them.
[02:11:22.528 --> 02:11:25.229]  I would think it would be higher, but 95% are against it.
[02:11:25.250 --> 02:11:26.630]  You know, have some brains.
[02:11:28.291 --> 02:11:30.172]  A few cells left in their noggins.
[02:11:32.006 --> 02:11:35.427]  So that company takes a dive every time they come out with a new promotion.
[02:11:35.647 --> 02:11:36.587]  They're a front company.
[02:11:36.607 --> 02:11:39.528]  They're really owned by IBM and the Communist Chinese military.
[02:11:39.548 --> 02:11:46.189]  A couple weeks ago, I had one of their big suppliers on, and he's like, yeah, I know the Chinese military owns the plant.
[02:11:46.229 --> 02:11:50.570]  Yeah, there's a global plan to put the chip in everybody, a global ID.
[02:11:50.610 --> 02:11:56.431]  Yeah, we want to put it in all the police and make it the law that gun owners have to buy it, the CEO Bolton told me.
[02:11:57.892 --> 02:11:59.112]  And we laid all of this out.
[02:12:01.323 --> 02:12:03.024]  This guy was really shooting his mouth off.
[02:12:04.204 --> 02:12:09.846]  Now, we have the articles where three years ago the Bureau of Prisons in California wanted to chip the prison population.
[02:12:10.426 --> 02:12:11.206]  That was in Reuters.
[02:12:11.246 --> 02:12:15.948]  We have articles where the government wants to put it in the troops and the old people and all this.
[02:12:16.008 --> 02:12:23.110]  But we were getting inside information of this global plan to put it in everyone for a world ID.
[02:12:23.490 --> 02:12:25.131]  Have to have it to buy and sell.
[02:12:25.191 --> 02:12:27.671]  His quote was, you'll have to have the chip.
[02:12:27.732 --> 02:12:29.092]  The chip will prevail.
[02:12:31.010 --> 02:12:43.241]  That was one of the bizarre statements of Baja Beach Club manager Conrad Chase, and so that's the system he's pushing.
[02:12:43.301 --> 02:12:55.432]  Then World Net Daily comes out yesterday, and Whole Hog takes sections of the article we wrote from the interview we did and republishes it and says, oh, we heard this on an American talk show.
[02:12:55.712 --> 02:12:57.994]  I wish you would have given us credit, but it really doesn't matter.
[02:12:59.395 --> 02:13:04.998]  And they have the quote in there where the CEO of the company wants it for a global ID system.
[02:13:05.118 --> 02:13:06.839]  Everyone must have the chip.
[02:13:06.879 --> 02:13:10.101]  And the government is out there pushing this, promoting this.
[02:13:12.943 --> 02:13:21.548]  And so my point is that I could tell you about the chips four, five, six, seven, eight years ago because it was in government documents.
[02:13:22.709 --> 02:13:24.850]  And so I sound like a kook five years ago.
[02:13:25.130 --> 02:13:26.791]  Today, it's in all the newspapers.
[02:13:27.811 --> 02:13:34.739]  This week, it was in the Sentinel out of Florida and the Associated Press that everyone needs a microchip under the skin.
[02:13:36.220 --> 02:13:40.485]  They want to put chips in the police so they can have access to their guns that are safe.
[02:13:40.825 --> 02:13:42.527]  They quoted police who are real mad about it.
[02:13:42.567 --> 02:13:43.208]  They don't want to do it.
[02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:46.752]  But it's really happening.
[02:13:47.432 --> 02:13:52.014]  But you listen to neocons, liars on talk radio, who aren't real conservatives.
[02:13:52.174 --> 02:13:54.455]  They are still denying that this even exists.
[02:13:54.475 --> 02:13:55.416]  Well, that's not quite true.
[02:13:55.996 --> 02:13:58.197]  Sean Hannity is more honest.
[02:13:58.237 --> 02:14:00.918]  He says that every child needs a chip.
[02:14:02.779 --> 02:14:04.780]  I got him on video on Fox News saying it.
[02:14:05.680 --> 02:14:06.821]  Every child needs a chip.
[02:14:06.921 --> 02:14:07.541]  Oh, it's great.
[02:14:07.901 --> 02:14:08.902]  I'm going to buy stock in it.
[02:14:12.714 --> 02:14:17.461]  So please take serious what we're saying and at least check out my statements.
[02:14:17.522 --> 02:14:20.005]  I mean, I've been on the air for 10 years now.
[02:14:21.407 --> 02:14:26.976]  Knock on wood, I've never been sued because I just go off of what's public domain knowledge.
[02:14:28.507 --> 02:14:33.830]  If I say DynCorp got caught kidnapping 200,000 women and children, I have the BBC I'm reading from.
[02:14:34.370 --> 02:14:44.056]  If I say they're planting pharmacological corn that grows live AIDS virus in 96 locations, I have the Associated Press that never made it in your newspaper that I got off the newswire.
[02:14:45.356 --> 02:14:50.199]  If I say that George Bush engages in satanic ceremonies, I got video of it.
[02:14:50.399 --> 02:14:51.940]  It's been on national television.
[02:14:52.120 --> 02:14:53.361]  It's called Bohemian Grove.
[02:14:54.418 --> 02:14:56.218]  I don't care how crazy it all sounds.
[02:14:56.659 --> 02:14:57.839]  I've got the documents.
[02:14:58.339 --> 02:14:59.699]  I'm neurotic about it.
[02:15:02.320 --> 02:15:05.261]  So please, I know we have a lot of new listeners every day to this show.
[02:15:05.661 --> 02:15:07.441]  And it sounds like a bad horror movie.
[02:15:07.681 --> 02:15:09.462]  Some late night science fiction movie.
[02:15:11.282 --> 02:15:12.042]  As I like to say.
[02:15:12.722 --> 02:15:14.863]  But this is the real deal.
[02:15:14.943 --> 02:15:16.883]  This is the reality.
[02:15:20.544 --> 02:15:21.684]  This is the new world order.
[02:15:22.985 --> 02:15:23.785]  And it's time
[02:15:24.625 --> 02:15:36.572]  For all of us to be honest about history and just how tyrannical governments have been, the horrible, horrible things that they have done, and to stop rationalizing.
[02:15:38.293 --> 02:15:45.177]  We'll go to your calls in just a second, as promised, but I wanted to go over this Baja Beach Club story.
[02:15:46.999 --> 02:15:52.562]  There are these huge 2,500 occupancy clubs, and it's based in the U.S., it's also in Europe and England.
[02:15:53.872 --> 02:16:11.608]  We had the Baja Beach Club manager on, Mr. Chase, and he talked about how the show Big Brother was coming out to interview him and others getting implanted and how wonderful it was and how the CEO had told him of Applied Digital.
[02:16:11.628 --> 02:16:14.751]  He's now a distributor that, again, world ID system.
[02:16:14.771 --> 02:16:15.992]  The police are going to have to take it.
[02:16:16.292 --> 02:16:17.773]  The population is going to have to take it.
[02:16:17.793 --> 02:16:20.596]  You're going to have to have it to get into their bar in the future.
[02:16:22.190 --> 02:16:30.037]  And then you read the World Net Daily article, paying for drinks with a wave of a hand, pub goers in Spain get implanted chips for ID payment purposes.
[02:16:32.138 --> 02:16:50.694]  And deeper in the article, they quote Chase as, well it says, during a recent American radio interview, Chase said the CEO of Verichip, Dr. Kenneth Bolton, had told him that the company's goal was to market the Verichip as a global implantable identification system.
[02:16:53.007 --> 02:17:00.253]  And it says with only 900 people implanted worldwide, though, the global mandate isn't exactly around the corner, and current applications are extremely limited.
[02:17:01.534 --> 02:17:02.234]  But here's the deal.
[02:17:03.716 --> 02:17:05.137]  They're going to make police take it.
[02:17:05.157 --> 02:17:06.738]  They're going to make the military take it.
[02:17:06.778 --> 02:17:09.500]  My cousin, Special Forces, has told me they've gotten the word.
[02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:10.021]  They're getting it.
[02:17:10.941 --> 02:17:12.482]  They're going to make the criminals take it.
[02:17:12.502 --> 02:17:13.063]  They're going to make...
[02:17:13.952 --> 02:17:17.554]  The CPS children that have been kidnapped from their parents take it.
[02:17:17.914 --> 02:17:18.814]  This is the plan.
[02:17:19.134 --> 02:17:21.215]  That's why they've got the new national draft coming.
[02:17:21.415 --> 02:17:26.377]  They can make you take the deadly vaccines, they can force you to take the microchips, and they're saying they're going to do it.
[02:17:27.558 --> 02:17:39.523]  He also alluded to plans of FN Herzl, which manufactures Browning and Smith & Wesson firearms to develop an implant firing system that would make a firearm functional only to the individual implanted with its corresponding microchip.
[02:17:39.983 --> 02:17:41.484]  Now that was two weeks ago on this show.
[02:17:42.262 --> 02:17:49.526]  Yesterday, the Sun Sentinel and the AP reported that FN Herzl is doing deals with the U.S.
[02:17:49.586 --> 02:17:54.489]  government in discussions to make the police and feds and others take the chip.
[02:17:54.769 --> 02:17:58.151]  And the Italian government is talking about making all their employees take it.
[02:17:58.411 --> 02:18:03.594]  We're talking now about governments making the population take microchips.
[02:18:03.834 --> 02:18:05.175]  We're now to that point.
[02:18:05.975 --> 02:18:09.217]  And once they've made the enforcers take it, they're going to make you take it.
[02:18:10.557 --> 02:18:11.318]  Heaven help us.
[02:18:12.239 --> 02:18:15.982]  Perhaps if a police officer can get through, I want to ask you, because we care about you.
[02:18:16.202 --> 02:18:18.324]  We're tired of you being brainwashed and used against us.
[02:18:18.544 --> 02:18:21.606]  We want to be on the same team with you, as patriots, as Americans.
[02:18:22.086 --> 02:18:23.287]  Are you going to take the chip?
[02:18:24.568 --> 02:18:25.529]  I'm asking you now.
[02:18:26.430 --> 02:18:30.293]  Let's go ahead and talk to... Oh, who's up next here?
[02:18:30.313 --> 02:18:30.973]  I get confused.
[02:18:32.354 --> 02:18:33.735]  Jason in Michigan, go ahead.
[02:18:34.936 --> 02:18:35.256]  Hello?
[02:18:35.537 --> 02:18:35.857]  Yes, sir.
[02:18:36.537 --> 02:18:37.098]  Mr. Jones?
[02:18:37.438 --> 02:18:37.618]  Yes.
[02:18:37.638 --> 02:18:39.860]  I'm not taking the chip, no, hell no.
[02:18:41.831 --> 02:18:45.876]  Kind of gives a new meaning to got a chip on your shoulder, huh?
[02:18:45.936 --> 02:18:46.237]  Yes.
[02:18:46.938 --> 02:18:49.020]  Well, sir, I'm just calling with some...
[02:18:50.296 --> 02:18:54.179]  Just a little status report from the front lines of the InfoWars here.
[02:18:54.519 --> 02:18:54.779]  Sure.
[02:18:55.159 --> 02:18:56.380]  We're up here in Michigan.
[02:18:56.821 --> 02:18:58.842]  Did you say you were from Michigan, actually?
[02:18:59.342 --> 02:19:00.883]  No, I'm from Dallas, Texas.
[02:19:01.304 --> 02:19:01.904]  Okay, okay.
[02:19:02.324 --> 02:19:08.729]  Well, Condoleezza Rice is making an appearance here at my school, Michigan State University, May 7th.
[02:19:08.829 --> 02:19:10.690]  I just learned about this last night.
[02:19:10.710 --> 02:19:13.352]  She's going to address some 8,000 undergraduates.
[02:19:13.752 --> 02:19:15.152]  You've got to stand up and shout.
[02:19:15.712 --> 02:19:20.414]  Why did you warn Mayor Willie Brown of San Francisco not to fly to New York on September 10th?
[02:19:20.814 --> 02:19:21.354]  Exactly.
[02:19:21.414 --> 02:19:23.534]  My friends and I are going to stage a massive protest.
[02:19:23.554 --> 02:19:30.496]  We're going to be passing out copies of your DVDs, copies of Catherine Fitt's letter to some 10,000 colleagues.
[02:19:30.516 --> 02:19:31.016]  Stay there, sir.
[02:19:31.176 --> 02:19:32.416]  I want to hear about this.
[02:19:35.677 --> 02:19:43.219]  By the way, Vanity Fair had to admit that Connalisa Rice did make the call to tell Mayor Willie Brown not to fly.
[02:19:45.106 --> 02:19:46.687]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:19:47.068 --> 02:19:52.812]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:19:53.072 --> 02:19:58.196]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:19:58.537 --> 02:20:07.824]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[02:20:08.164 --> 02:20:13.150]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[02:20:13.450 --> 02:20:17.455]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[02:20:17.675 --> 02:20:22.421]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[02:20:22.801 --> 02:20:28.708]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:20:29.048 --> 02:20:35.257]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:20:35.317 --> 02:20:36.299]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[02:20:36.359 --> 02:20:37.260]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:44.938 --> 02:20:50.460]  Old timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[02:20:50.700 --> 02:20:56.281]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[02:20:56.501 --> 02:20:58.842]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[02:20:58.982 --> 02:21:00.042]  Well, you get the idea.
[02:21:00.202 --> 02:21:10.085]  Too bad the big seed companies became big greed companies, and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses, artificially ripened with gas, could be grown much quicker, fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[02:21:10.405 --> 02:21:19.874]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[02:21:20.094 --> 02:21:29.243]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.
[02:21:29.543 --> 02:21:33.708]  That's 417-924-8917 or visit rareseeds.com and get started on the pathway to great gardening and great flavor.
[02:21:44.542 --> 02:21:49.244]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[02:21:49.484 --> 02:21:52.925]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[02:21:53.145 --> 02:21:55.606]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[02:21:55.846 --> 02:22:04.449]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[02:22:04.809 --> 02:22:10.571]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[02:22:10.851 --> 02:22:12.812]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.
[02:22:13.052 --> 02:22:19.973]  Backed by over 40 years of successfully forecasting the world's financial markets, Bob has helped thousands of people make sense of their financial futures.
[02:22:20.333 --> 02:22:26.775]  Midas Resources is pleased to offer a subscription to the International Forecaster newsletter free of charge with a qualifying order.
[02:22:27.055 --> 02:22:27.535]  That's right.
[02:22:27.615 --> 02:22:34.377]  For a limited time, Midas Resources is offering a one-year subscription to Bob Chapman's powerful newsletter, the International Forecaster.
[02:22:34.637 --> 02:22:39.083]  Call 800-686-2237 for more information or to place your order.
[02:22:39.183 --> 02:22:39.423]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:22:39.443 --> 02:22:41.446]  Call today and avoid getting soaked tomorrow.
[02:22:45.274 --> 02:22:45.915]  Urgent message.
[02:22:46.135 --> 02:22:53.381]  Effective April 14, 2004, heavy fines and penalties will be imposed for all persons and entities who are not in compliance with HIPAA.
[02:22:53.521 --> 02:22:57.124]  HIPAA is a federal law designed to protect all patients' private health information.
[02:22:57.404 --> 02:23:02.709]  It impacts over 30 million health professionals, but will also impact professionals outside of the medical field.
[02:23:02.909 --> 02:23:07.673]  This year, Health and Human Services has developed a program to reward those who report violators of HIPAA.
[02:23:07.753 --> 02:23:09.515]  There are thousands of violations currently,
[02:23:09.735 --> 02:23:11.776]  Come see why this company is becoming the industry's leader in HIPAA education.
[02:23:11.796 --> 02:23:13.397]  Visit us at yourhippacert.com or call us at 720-312-0709.
[02:23:26.582 --> 02:23:33.029]  Again, that's your HIPAAcert.com or call us at 720-312-0709.
[02:23:33.269 --> 02:23:35.011]  Act now before action is taken against you.
[02:23:35.211 --> 02:23:36.112]  Don't think it affects you?
[02:23:36.312 --> 02:23:38.995]  If your company provides insurance through its employees, it does.
[02:23:39.175 --> 02:23:39.775]  Call today, 720-312-0709.
[02:23:57.663 --> 02:23:59.907]  All right, my friends, Alex Jones here back live.
[02:24:00.568 --> 02:24:07.418]  And we're talking to Jason in Michigan about Condi Rice, the National Security Advisor, coming to this university.
[02:24:07.438 --> 02:24:08.360]  We'll get to that in a second.
[02:24:08.821 --> 02:24:10.984]  When I make a mistake, I'm the first person to admit it.
[02:24:11.696 --> 02:24:13.917]  Very important that we do that here on this broadcast.
[02:24:14.478 --> 02:24:18.280]  And Vince is one of our Affiliate Relations people, and he called me twice, he said.
[02:24:18.300 --> 02:24:24.023]  I do remember him now about a week ago mentioning it to me, a new affiliate, 1500WASN.
[02:24:26.804 --> 02:24:30.106]  Tell us about that, because I dropped the ball.
[02:24:30.166 --> 02:24:30.867]  I'm here to admit it.
[02:24:30.907 --> 02:24:31.767]  I'm big enough to do it.
[02:24:31.967 --> 02:24:32.908]  Go ahead, Vince.
[02:24:34.348 --> 02:24:36.290]  We're going to bring Vince up on air now.
[02:24:36.370 --> 02:24:37.090]  Vince, are you there?
[02:24:37.270 --> 02:24:37.750]  Yeah, I'm here.
[02:24:38.151 --> 02:24:38.531]  Can you hear me?
[02:24:39.395 --> 02:24:41.416]  I was just telling Vince I want him on air, and he said, okay.
[02:24:41.716 --> 02:24:42.256]  Is Vince there?
[02:24:42.276 --> 02:24:43.496]  Stephanie?
[02:24:43.736 --> 02:24:44.216]  Stephanie.
[02:24:45.977 --> 02:24:46.797]  I guess not, huh?
[02:24:47.257 --> 02:24:47.617]  I'm here.
[02:24:47.678 --> 02:24:47.958]  Hello?
[02:24:48.098 --> 02:24:48.558]  Can you hear me?
[02:24:48.638 --> 02:24:49.538]  Yes, I can hear you.
[02:24:49.618 --> 02:24:49.778]  Oh, okay.
[02:24:49.798 --> 02:24:50.278]  Now I'm up.
[02:24:50.398 --> 02:24:50.958]  Okay.
[02:24:51.239 --> 02:24:53.239]  I've been saying hello for the past, like, minute now.
[02:24:53.259 --> 02:24:55.280]  Well, you probably were on the air, and I probably wasn't.
[02:24:55.320 --> 02:24:55.720]  Go ahead.
[02:24:55.900 --> 02:24:56.920]  No, you were on the air.
[02:24:56.940 --> 02:24:58.601]  I think Stephanie was just on the phone.
[02:24:58.621 --> 02:24:59.201]  No big deal.
[02:25:00.421 --> 02:25:01.662]  So you want me to tell you about WASN?
[02:25:03.206 --> 02:25:03.787]  Yeah, do that.
[02:25:04.568 --> 02:25:11.537]  Well, it's a nice lady, young lady, Madeline Halfacre, approached me and wanted to pick up your show.
[02:25:12.058 --> 02:25:15.382]  She says that there's kind of an outcry for you out there.
[02:25:15.743 --> 02:25:17.665]  The Power Hour, Gary Brownfield, and you...
[02:25:18.590 --> 02:25:23.813]  Are all on in that area, all hours of all the shows.
[02:25:24.233 --> 02:25:26.314]  Well, that's quite a lineup, and we're excited about it.
[02:25:26.634 --> 02:25:29.896]  It's 1,500, and I'm told it covers quite a few major cities.
[02:25:29.976 --> 02:25:30.356]  That's right.
[02:25:30.376 --> 02:25:32.297]  It goes over the Cleveland area, actually.
[02:25:33.157 --> 02:25:37.179]  So you've got quite a lot of people that are going to wake up.
[02:25:37.619 --> 02:25:38.580]  I tell you, we will.
[02:25:39.060 --> 02:25:40.681]  We've got a station into L.A.
[02:25:40.741 --> 02:25:43.162]  and San Diego and all these big cities now.
[02:25:43.182 --> 02:25:44.762]  Well, that's exciting and good job, Vince.
[02:25:44.802 --> 02:25:46.062]  It's only growing from here, Alex.
[02:25:46.083 --> 02:25:46.383]  You bet.
[02:25:46.463 --> 02:25:50.064]  And I want to thank WASN for picking up the broadcast.
[02:25:50.544 --> 02:25:57.166]  And occasionally you hear little mess-ups like that because I'm in Austin, Texas, and they're in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[02:25:57.887 --> 02:25:59.907]  Or I should say a suburb of Minneapolis, St.
[02:25:59.927 --> 02:26:00.187]  Paul.
[02:26:00.587 --> 02:26:01.788]  And so sometimes it's...
[02:26:02.950 --> 02:26:06.653]  I do a remote every day of my broadcast career, my friends, and I enjoy it.
[02:26:06.993 --> 02:26:08.514]  And the folks running the show do a great job.
[02:26:08.835 --> 02:26:09.976]  Okay, going back to Jason.
[02:26:09.996 --> 02:26:11.297]  I want to stay on these issues now.
[02:26:11.777 --> 02:26:13.899]  Jason, you've got Condoleezza Rice coming to town.
[02:26:14.639 --> 02:26:21.665]  A few months ago when John Ashcroft was there up in Michigan, somebody got into the stage town hall meeting because it was a staged event.
[02:26:21.705 --> 02:26:22.946]  Tickets were given to select people.
[02:26:23.989 --> 02:26:33.353]  And brought up the fact of the government being ordered to stand down and the Bushes and the Bin Ladens and Ashcroft freaked out on the stage.
[02:26:34.294 --> 02:26:46.239]  You guys need to be careful, though, because don't tell people beforehand and have part of your group that's quietly in the audience away from your group because as soon as they see the fact that you're handing out material, they're going to try to throw you out.
[02:26:46.279 --> 02:26:46.879]  Go ahead, Jason.
[02:26:48.149 --> 02:26:49.030]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:26:49.430 --> 02:26:51.712]  We're going to keep it real secretive.
[02:26:52.472 --> 02:27:00.699]  We're actually going to take chalk on the sidewalks and write information on the chalks, but keep it real secretive at first.
[02:27:00.759 --> 02:27:03.221]  But it'll be some spectacle.
[02:27:04.041 --> 02:27:06.303]  I guess it's a graduation speech.
[02:27:06.884 --> 02:27:13.249]  She's actually going to talk to the graduates, which is a slap in the face, really, if you look at it.
[02:27:13.269 --> 02:27:15.450]  Yeah, she's going to be talking to the alumni.
[02:27:15.630 --> 02:27:16.231]  Shout out!
[02:27:17.023 --> 02:27:26.449]  Why did you, according to the San Francisco Chronicle, why did the administration call Mayor Willie Brown your best friend and tell him not to fly to New York on the night of September 10th?
[02:27:26.809 --> 02:27:27.849]  Why did you tell him that?
[02:27:28.370 --> 02:27:30.011]  Why didn't you warn the people?
[02:27:30.991 --> 02:27:32.072]  Yeah, I'm going to do it here.
[02:27:32.252 --> 02:27:33.413]  We did Reno that one time.
[02:27:33.433 --> 02:27:35.094]  Yeah, that was a lot of fun.
[02:27:36.714 --> 02:27:38.936]  We've done it to Hillary, to George Bush.
[02:27:39.256 --> 02:27:41.517]  Now, George Bush had me kidnapped, and that's on video.
[02:27:41.557 --> 02:27:42.318]  Have you seen that video?
[02:27:43.138 --> 02:27:43.458]  No.
[02:27:45.319 --> 02:27:45.800]  When you were...
[02:27:46.810 --> 02:27:49.771]  Just like he kidnapped Alan Keyes.
[02:27:49.811 --> 02:27:50.771]  Remember Alan Keyes?
[02:27:51.752 --> 02:28:00.235]  In the 96 debates, he was scheduled to speak, and they grabbed him, drove him around for an hour, threw him out in a literal crack neighborhood on the side of the road.
[02:28:00.255 --> 02:28:03.196]  Oh my goodness, I do remember you saying something about that.
[02:28:03.216 --> 02:28:04.076]  Well, I got video of it.
[02:28:04.096 --> 02:28:11.859]  I just asked Bush a question at the end of his speech, and they had me grabbed, almost broke my arm, and drove me around for 45 minutes and threw me out on the side of the highway.
[02:28:12.461 --> 02:28:15.122]  Well, there'll be 30 of us, so they'll have to get us off.
[02:28:15.162 --> 02:28:17.123]  Listen, break up in groups of five.
[02:28:17.603 --> 02:28:20.164]  Have one group that's out handing out stuff and being visible.
[02:28:20.404 --> 02:28:21.725]  Have your other groups broken up.
[02:28:22.365 --> 02:28:26.767]  And then when one group shouts and they come and grab you, then another group shouts the same thing.
[02:28:27.407 --> 02:28:28.468]  Oh, okay.
[02:28:28.508 --> 02:28:29.268]  That's a great idea.
[02:28:29.548 --> 02:28:36.031]  I'm actually going to be on a ladder, and I have a friend who's going to dress up as Condoleezza.
[02:28:36.451 --> 02:28:39.092]  I'm going to have puppet strings at the top of the ladder.
[02:28:40.501 --> 02:28:41.441]  Well, let me tell you something.
[02:28:41.461 --> 02:28:42.822]  That'll be priceless video.
[02:28:43.242 --> 02:28:50.585]  You need to have somebody who's by themselves in the group at a good vantage point, preferably about halfway up in the aisles, with a video camera.
[02:28:51.406 --> 02:28:51.586]  Yep.
[02:28:52.426 --> 02:28:53.206]  Yep, we're going to tape it.
[02:28:53.406 --> 02:28:55.167]  That's going to be solid gold.
[02:28:55.667 --> 02:28:56.568]  All right, bud.
[02:28:56.868 --> 02:28:57.828]  I've got to get back to work.
[02:28:57.928 --> 02:28:59.549]  But a pleasure talking to you, as always.
[02:28:59.829 --> 02:29:00.910]  Hey, pleasure talking to you.
[02:29:01.050 --> 02:29:03.971]  All right, as usual, I'm going slowly to the calls here.
[02:29:04.011 --> 02:29:08.373]  We'll come back, talk to Terry, Michael, Clint, and...
[02:29:09.702 --> 02:29:11.063]  Dan, and then that's it for calls.
[02:29:11.083 --> 02:29:17.365]  Because I want to tell you what the future holds, what life will be like in five years if we don't stop this thing.
[02:29:18.165 --> 02:29:24.307]  And then I want to hit some of the Iraq news and some of the other CIA bin Laden statements as well.
[02:29:24.427 --> 02:29:25.628]  So stay with us.
[02:29:25.668 --> 02:29:28.188]  We've got 30 minutes left in this transmission against tyranny.
[02:29:28.649 --> 02:29:32.510]  Infowars.com and presentplanet.com are the websites.
[02:29:35.511 --> 02:29:36.411]  We're on the march.
[02:29:36.891 --> 02:29:38.412]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:39.504 --> 02:29:40.685]  We're good to go.
[02:30:00.299 --> 02:30:01.340]  We're good to go.
[02:30:28.763 --> 02:30:38.432]  1-2-3-NoDebt.com Come over and get our rock-solid technology that waves out debt without bankruptcy.

[02:32:53.251 --> 02:32:54.972]  All right, let's go straight back to the calls.
[02:32:55.052 --> 02:32:56.773]  Let's talk to Terry in Washington.
[02:32:56.813 --> 02:32:59.094]  Terry, thanks for holding here on the air worldwide.
[02:32:59.454 --> 02:33:00.275]  Yeah, Alex.
[02:33:01.852 --> 02:33:05.874]  I was phoning in regard to this technological change that they're putting on us.
[02:33:08.556 --> 02:33:22.304]  I'm up here in the state of Washington on a small island, and Bill Gates from Microsoft and Cuget Sound Power Company is running data streams through the power lines now up there and has been doing so for five years.
[02:33:22.945 --> 02:33:25.326]  They came out and popped off the meters on it.
[02:33:25.346 --> 02:33:30.349]  And they admit it's blanking out AM, FM transmissions, mainly AM, shortwave, you name it.
[02:33:30.822 --> 02:33:32.883]  Well, I haven't seen that problem.
[02:33:33.303 --> 02:33:35.144]  I've checked my wires around here.
[02:33:35.564 --> 02:33:39.945]  Well, it might not be in your area, but even the FCC admits it.
[02:33:40.046 --> 02:33:41.626]  Even FEMA doesn't like it.
[02:33:42.727 --> 02:33:48.269]  Well, I detect no leakage outside of the magnetic field on the wires.
[02:33:48.529 --> 02:33:50.129]  Okay, but please continue.
[02:33:51.070 --> 02:33:57.192]  Anyway, they managed to eliminate all the meter readers for the electric company that way.
[02:33:57.964 --> 02:34:15.888]  I gave the meter reader a couple of your tapes and shook her hand and said goodbye a couple of years ago, and the meter reading is working, and it only goes up about five miles up the line to a little black box with what looks like a directional antenna on it.
[02:34:16.549 --> 02:34:17.969]  It points to a cell tower.
[02:34:18.009 --> 02:34:20.510]  Yeah, we've got those in certain areas of Austin.
[02:34:20.530 --> 02:34:25.471]  You'll see a box with an antenna, and I called the city about a year ago and said, what is that in my neighborhood?
[02:34:25.491 --> 02:34:26.151]  And they said, oh...
[02:34:26.978 --> 02:34:34.080]  That's the meter reading system, and we read your meter with that, so, yeah, I don't see the meter reader anymore.
[02:34:34.780 --> 02:34:45.243]  And the point is that with all these systems, they've even talked about with these data streams, and this is mainstream, that they can even listen to what's going on in your house with some of these systems.
[02:34:46.844 --> 02:34:47.924]  It just goes on and on.
[02:34:48.284 --> 02:34:49.305]  Oh, yeah, without doubt.
[02:34:49.385 --> 02:34:54.046]  But always the technology, like Anthony Sutton was saying before he died,
[02:34:54.659 --> 02:34:58.141]  That it's always used for our chains.
[02:34:58.261 --> 02:35:01.964]  It's always keeping us through the wars.
[02:35:02.044 --> 02:35:02.945]  It's never to improve society.
[02:35:02.985 --> 02:35:10.049]  Did you hear me read this Information Week article where the feds admit they're going to make us take factor chips in our cars and track us everywhere we go?
[02:35:10.990 --> 02:35:11.250]  Yeah.
[02:35:11.891 --> 02:35:13.312]  I mean, that's not freedom, people.
[02:35:13.892 --> 02:35:14.492]  No, it's not.
[02:35:15.653 --> 02:35:16.734]  Good to hear from you, Terry.
[02:35:17.654 --> 02:35:20.256]  Let's talk to Mike in Mass.
[02:35:20.316 --> 02:35:20.937]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:35:20.957 --> 02:35:21.957]  Hi, Alex.
[02:35:22.177 --> 02:35:22.478]  Hello.
[02:35:22.598 --> 02:35:22.818]  Hello.
[02:35:23.414 --> 02:35:24.815]  I've been listening to you for quite a while.
[02:35:24.835 --> 02:35:27.297]  It's the first time I've ever called a radio station.
[02:35:27.317 --> 02:35:29.018]  Well, welcome to the airwaves.
[02:35:29.098 --> 02:35:29.879]  Thank you very much.
[02:35:31.020 --> 02:35:33.682]  I just wanted to report something that I saw last week.
[02:35:33.702 --> 02:35:44.050]  I was getting on the highway to go to work, and the end of the ramp was blocked off by state police, and there were a few cars backed up.
[02:35:44.690 --> 02:35:52.016]  And we saw a convoy of about a dozen old boys, big trucks, low beds,
[02:35:53.038 --> 02:35:57.962]  And they were about seven or eight state police giving them an escort.
[02:35:58.862 --> 02:36:09.470]  And on the back of these trailers, they had two big cement, looked like cells.
[02:36:11.191 --> 02:36:13.573]  And on the back of them, there was a door on either side.
[02:36:13.613 --> 02:36:14.474]  There were no windows.
[02:36:15.535 --> 02:36:15.655]  And...
[02:36:17.028 --> 02:36:19.369]  Yeah, there were about a dozen trucks in the convoy.
[02:36:19.689 --> 02:36:21.869]  Was that going towards the port of Boston?
[02:36:22.029 --> 02:36:22.369]  It was.
[02:36:22.389 --> 02:36:23.449]  It was heading up north.
[02:36:23.690 --> 02:36:25.150]  Okay, well, let me stop you.
[02:36:25.210 --> 02:36:35.712]  I don't know if this is what we're dealing with, but they admit that they have room for about 1,000 people at the Halliburton Run concentration camp in Guantanamo Bay.
[02:36:35.752 --> 02:36:41.374]  And again, the head general, Rick Baucus, quit a year and a half ago and said, I refuse to torture innocent people.
[02:36:41.414 --> 02:36:43.034]  It's not even real Taliban or al-Qaeda.
[02:36:44.032 --> 02:36:46.936]  There at the base, it's all part of the torture training.
[02:36:47.717 --> 02:36:52.243]  The cement of blood like the Nazis had to create a hardcore group of torture experts.
[02:36:53.132 --> 02:37:03.903]  And I did read where they're ordering enough for 20,000 people there at Camp X-Ray, this was last year, of prefab concrete cells.
[02:37:04.103 --> 02:37:04.384]  Right.
[02:37:04.584 --> 02:37:15.315]  And that they were being built on the East Coast and in Texas and loaded onto ships to be ferried to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
[02:37:15.968 --> 02:37:17.689]  So that's probably what you were saying.
[02:37:18.049 --> 02:37:25.414]  My son the next day said that on an intersecting highway, to this highway, he also saw a convoy of the same thing.
[02:37:25.434 --> 02:37:28.856]  So that's a lot of them.
[02:37:29.496 --> 02:37:39.683]  And I just wanted to... I went to our local FEMA site, which is MEMA here, Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, and...
[02:37:40.513 --> 02:37:41.934]  I drove around the entire area.
[02:37:41.954 --> 02:37:44.455]  I couldn't see anything there that resembled those.
[02:37:44.635 --> 02:37:46.636]  So I suppose that's where they're going then, down south.
[02:37:46.656 --> 02:37:53.880]  Well, I don't know that, but I know that they're making a bunch of prefab concrete structures to be shipped to Camp X-Ray.
[02:37:54.561 --> 02:37:55.601]  Didn't give me a good feeling.
[02:37:56.082 --> 02:37:57.762]  But you said they were going towards the port.
[02:37:58.183 --> 02:37:59.023]  Yes, they were headed north.
[02:37:59.483 --> 02:38:03.405]  I got a sneaking suspicion that if you went to the port to investigate it, they probably were loaded on ships.
[02:38:04.086 --> 02:38:05.787]  Yeah, well, that makes good sense.
[02:38:05.807 --> 02:38:08.268]  And they say, by the way, citizens will be going to that facility.
[02:38:08.948 --> 02:38:09.669]  Not this citizen.
[02:38:10.928 --> 02:38:11.769]  I hear you, my friend.
[02:38:11.789 --> 02:38:12.189]  Take care.
[02:38:13.330 --> 02:38:15.192]  Let's go ahead and talk to Clint.
[02:38:15.712 --> 02:38:16.693]  Clint in Missouri.
[02:38:16.773 --> 02:38:17.474]  Clint, go ahead.
[02:38:17.874 --> 02:38:28.504]  Yeah, Alex, I've just been listening to your show today, and I noticed a lot of people that called in had themes that were in common, like some people called in about the high property taxes and getting your land.
[02:38:29.585 --> 02:38:37.892]  Some people quoted Lincoln's changing of the Constitution essentially illegally, suppression of the news.
[02:38:39.806 --> 02:39:01.483]  I just want to urge that people should know their history because what I have found by studying my history is that when our government starts conducting operations such as in Iraq or Afghanistan, they go to the old playbook every time and they use what they've always used no matter whether it's effective form or not or the best thing to do or not.
[02:39:03.325 --> 02:39:05.286]  You talked about predicting things in advance.
[02:39:05.326 --> 02:39:07.588]  Well, I use my history books
[02:39:08.342 --> 02:39:09.682]  To predict what they're going to do.
[02:39:10.403 --> 02:39:22.086]  I wrote an article probably six months ago predicting what was going to probably happen in Iraq as far as this guerrilla war activity and how it was going to get real nasty and real bloody.
[02:39:22.126 --> 02:39:25.687]  I based it on basically what happened here in the Civil War.
[02:39:27.208 --> 02:39:36.811]  I just want to urge people, please study your history because it's been proven time and time again that they're going to use these same tactics over and over.
[02:39:37.865 --> 02:39:42.048]  We need to stop being so naive and stop trusting the government.
[02:39:42.509 --> 02:39:44.710]  And by the way, that couldn't be any more American.
[02:39:44.750 --> 02:39:47.492]  That's what our founding fathers told us to do.
[02:39:47.512 --> 02:39:48.673]  Thanks for the call.
[02:39:49.534 --> 02:39:50.274]  One last call.
[02:39:50.314 --> 02:39:51.235]  I'm sorry to all the others.
[02:39:51.295 --> 02:39:52.396]  I've got to hit some more news.
[02:39:53.277 --> 02:39:54.397]  Dan in Colorado.
[02:39:54.438 --> 02:39:55.158]  Dan, go ahead.
[02:39:55.178 --> 02:39:56.539]  Alex Jones.
[02:39:56.919 --> 02:39:57.160]  Yes.
[02:39:58.220 --> 02:40:07.127]  I am a college student up here in Colorado, and I've taken your advice and done extensive research on a single subject
[02:40:08.130 --> 02:40:14.974]  I'm Alex Jones, and I'm here today to talk to you about something that's been going on for a long time.
[02:40:26.604 --> 02:40:37.768]  Not to use the tap water because the Board of Health openly admits that infants' drinking formula made with city water will be overdosed by 100 times normal fluoride level.
[02:40:37.888 --> 02:40:42.490]  And this is so sick that only the bottled water it stores, it'll say for kids.
[02:40:43.211 --> 02:40:44.693]  Has high levels of fluoride.
[02:40:44.713 --> 02:40:45.734]  They add fluoride.
[02:40:46.094 --> 02:40:51.600]  This is part of an admitted UN plan to reduce IQs of the population to dumb us down.
[02:40:52.200 --> 02:40:55.824]  It sounds unbelievable that we've caught them adding it to the vaccines.
[02:40:55.844 --> 02:40:59.368]  We've caught them adding sterilization chemicals to the vaccines.
[02:40:59.488 --> 02:41:02.551]  It is so dastardly, but old as Huxley.
[02:41:03.655 --> 02:41:07.497]  Whose brother was the first Secretary General of UNESCO, Julian Huxley.
[02:41:07.817 --> 02:41:18.843]  He wrote Brave New World in 1933, and in the last speech he gave in 1962 at Berkeley, he said, Brave New World is what I think is going to happen by 2000.
[02:41:19.903 --> 02:41:28.708]  I've been in the British government, I've been in the eugenics movement, they plan to dumb us down chemically, to drug us, to brain damage large classes of us at birth.
[02:41:29.452 --> 02:41:35.836]  I've been to the sanitariums in England where they already have electronics hooked into people's brains, controlling them.
[02:41:36.656 --> 02:41:38.857]  And he gave this speech at Berkeley to thousands.
[02:41:40.018 --> 02:41:42.719]  So you ask, how is 1984 coming true?
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:44.841]  How is Brave New World coming true?
[02:41:45.421 --> 02:41:47.442]  Both these guys work for the British government.
[02:41:48.503 --> 02:41:57.748]  And Huxley's brother, again, was the head of UNESCO, which calls for breaking up the family, abortion, control, all of this, and Bush just signed back onto it.
[02:41:57.788 --> 02:41:57.928]  So...
[02:41:58.858 --> 02:42:02.099]  Again, the horror is hard to believe, but it's documented.
[02:42:04.500 --> 02:42:11.363]  The first time that sodium fluoride was introduced into water supplies was in Nazi Germany and concentration camps in Russia.
[02:42:11.443 --> 02:42:13.544]  And I have EPI and Associated Press reports.
[02:42:13.844 --> 02:42:18.486]  They would use it in the camps to make the slave labor more docile.
[02:42:19.006 --> 02:42:20.006]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:42:21.147 --> 02:42:22.027]  And then magically...
[02:42:22.791 --> 02:42:23.552]  It's in our water.
[02:42:23.612 --> 02:42:26.093]  It's not calcium fluoride, which you do need some of.
[02:42:26.373 --> 02:42:33.077]  It's the byproduct of aluminum manufacturing as well as fertilizer manufacturing.
[02:42:33.117 --> 02:42:35.479]  And it's not just sodium fluoride.
[02:42:35.499 --> 02:42:39.281]  It also has Grignard reagents and heavy metals in it.
[02:42:40.262 --> 02:42:42.603]  They take a toxic waste and put it in the water.
[02:42:42.944 --> 02:42:48.127]  Like they take depleted uranium, a toxic byproduct they have to bury, and they just put it in munitions.
[02:42:49.161 --> 02:43:02.545]  Yeah, the Un-American Activities Report for 1939, a Communist Party member, Oliver Kenneth Goff, openly admits of their conspiracy to keep
[02:43:08.784 --> 02:43:12.385]  Exactly, and then you wonder why the population can't think.
[02:43:12.405 --> 02:43:14.626]  That's why we've got to get off tap water.
[02:43:15.206 --> 02:43:16.666]  The bottled water has it in it, too.
[02:43:16.707 --> 02:43:18.287]  You've got to properly filter it.
[02:43:18.307 --> 02:43:23.148]  It takes very expensive filters to do this, and it just so happens we promote one.
[02:43:23.188 --> 02:43:25.609]  But the point is that just research it.
[02:43:25.629 --> 02:43:27.849]  The stuff you buy at the store doesn't do it.
[02:43:28.590 --> 02:43:30.110]  And look, I'm not exaggerating.
[02:43:31.448 --> 02:43:33.389]  I have probably seen... Let's be conservative.
[02:43:35.770 --> 02:43:37.490]  I've got to say over 1,000.
[02:43:37.790 --> 02:43:43.472]  Over 1,000 medical studies from China, Russia, the U.S., England, going back to the 20s.
[02:43:44.213 --> 02:43:54.736]  I saw over 50 studies, it was more than that, done by UT from the 30s to the 90s, admitting sodium fluoride literally Swiss cheeses the brain.
[02:43:55.697 --> 02:43:59.298]  Yes, it disguises itself as hydrogen, and...
[02:44:00.825 --> 02:44:03.928]  Literally lobotomizes you.
[02:44:03.948 --> 02:44:06.189]  So, you investigated what I said as a college student.
[02:44:06.649 --> 02:44:10.132]  How many studies did you find that were mainstream?
[02:44:10.492 --> 02:44:11.133]  Not too many.
[02:44:12.193 --> 02:44:15.416]  I had to go to the Fluoride Action Network.
[02:44:16.056 --> 02:44:16.897]  You know what you were doing?
[02:44:16.917 --> 02:44:18.758]  You weren't using the proper keyword searches.
[02:44:21.633 --> 02:44:28.256]  We probably posted 200 articles out of England where they're stopping the use of it because of protests and scientists.
[02:44:28.696 --> 02:44:31.858]  We probably posted 200 articles the last year or so out of England alone.
[02:44:32.478 --> 02:44:41.862]  When I went to the Fluoride Action Network, I typed in my local paper, and it gave me all the articles that were posted in my local paper, the Fort Collins, Colorado one.
[02:44:42.942 --> 02:44:43.463]  Really?
[02:44:43.783 --> 02:44:48.865]  Yeah, it gave me all the articles that were ever publicly posted on sodium fluoride.
[02:44:50.874 --> 02:44:53.675]  And, yeah, it's not good.
[02:44:53.715 --> 02:44:59.876]  I even went down to the water department and interviewed them, and they refused to answer any of my questions on sodium fluoride.
[02:44:59.936 --> 02:45:04.977]  They said that if they had known I was coming down to ask questions about sodium fluoride, that they could have saved me a trip.
[02:45:05.417 --> 02:45:10.079]  Because due to the politics and legalities, they could not answer any of my questions.
[02:45:11.479 --> 02:45:13.579]  Got a big fat skull and crossbones on it.
[02:45:13.599 --> 02:45:14.260]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:14.280 --> 02:45:15.740]  I appreciate what you're doing.
[02:45:18.647 --> 02:45:20.008]  I don't even know how to explain this.
[02:45:20.648 --> 02:45:22.829]  The Nazis used it in the camps.
[02:45:24.410 --> 02:45:27.712]  I mean, what do you people need to wake up?
[02:45:29.713 --> 02:45:30.013]  I don't know.
[02:45:30.493 --> 02:45:33.895]  Let me just spend a few minutes on what the future holds, a scenario.
[02:45:34.915 --> 02:45:41.439]  Instead of an article here, an article there explaining this, let me just give you the average day, let's say in a college student's life.
[02:45:41.499 --> 02:45:45.941]  No, no, let's say a high school student's life, because in five years it will be the worst for them.
[02:45:48.149 --> 02:45:49.690]  Other than elderly people and prisoners.
[02:45:49.750 --> 02:45:54.172]  But I could take an elderly person and use an example of that, or I could use the prisoners.
[02:45:54.812 --> 02:46:02.715]  But let's just take a high school senior, and let's say where it's really bad.
[02:46:02.735 --> 02:46:06.917]  Oh, someplace like Pennsylvania or Texas, where stuff's really accelerated.
[02:46:06.937 --> 02:46:10.518]  I could use my home state or say Pennsylvania or California.
[02:46:11.339 --> 02:46:12.039]  Let me describe it.
[02:46:14.039 --> 02:46:29.564]  You get up, and to graduate from high school, you have to serve 20 hours a week under the new SecureCore tips program, and you go to your computer screen and dial in your access code to the local emergency management group, and you're given your orders for the day.
[02:46:30.785 --> 02:46:33.926]  That night, you have to watch your computer for two hours.
[02:46:33.986 --> 02:46:40.288]  It's going to give you access to a dozen surveillance cameras in South Beach, Florida.
[02:46:40.708 --> 02:46:43.049]  You live in, let's say...
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:45.821]  Youngstown, Ohio.
[02:46:47.062 --> 02:46:48.443]  Okay.
[02:46:48.484 --> 02:46:49.444]  This was in the New York Times.
[02:46:49.484 --> 02:46:50.725]  Everything I'm saying has been in the news.
[02:46:51.526 --> 02:46:52.527]  Okay.
[02:46:52.627 --> 02:46:53.668]  I could spend an hour on this.
[02:46:53.708 --> 02:46:54.629]  I don't know if I have time.
[02:46:55.229 --> 02:46:57.712]  Let me just give you some of the day of this person.
[02:46:58.873 --> 02:47:01.915]  So when they get home that night, they have to spend two hours doing that.
[02:47:02.476 --> 02:47:08.901]  So you sit there on your computer, and you watch other surveillance cameras for, quote, terrorist or criminal activity.
[02:47:08.922 --> 02:47:10.463]  Notice terror and criminal are connected.
[02:47:11.272 --> 02:47:34.240]  And if you see any suspicious activity off of surveillance cameras in another city, another state, you dial in your code, and the local police department emergency system in South Beach, Florida, and remember, you're in Youngstown, Ohio, you then have to contact them, and they then look at the cameras you're looking at and then decide whether to dispatch somebody.
[02:47:34.420 --> 02:47:37.661]  But in case you're being lazy, not doing your job,
[02:47:38.740 --> 02:47:57.435]  There are complex computer programs that will simulate someone leaving a satchel by a fence at a school, and it will be a computer animated image that you can't even tell is fake on a black and white screen, and it will go up and plant a bomb, giving you the psychological image that terrorists are attacking, and making sure we're all on our toes.
[02:47:57.876 --> 02:48:05.562]  They will have like a video game, a simulated terrorist, and you don't know if it's real or fake, because there's no real terrorism, so they've got to create this illusion.
[02:48:05.822 --> 02:48:07.704]  It's a type of conditioning and mind control.
[02:48:09.136 --> 02:48:19.481]  And so they will grade you, and you can be not given your hours and not graduate if you fail, and don't diligently watch the surveillance cameras, which they put fake images on.
[02:48:19.501 --> 02:48:28.866]  That also gets us used to running man type fake images in the news and fake news reports, so when they get caught doing this in the future on the national news, they can say, oh, it was just a simulation.
[02:48:31.448 --> 02:48:32.168]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[02:48:32.868 --> 02:48:37.391]  Okay, so we've gotten the last three minutes up to breakfast in the house.
[02:48:39.459 --> 02:48:43.642]  The young person rides the school bus.
[02:48:45.904 --> 02:48:50.727]  Not that a senior would, but just for the sake of argument, because actually the younger people like to do this.
[02:48:51.888 --> 02:48:59.653]  He straps on his ID badge with a tracker chip in it, RFID, with a barcode, wearing a uniform.
[02:49:00.494 --> 02:49:01.354]  The bus pulls up.
[02:49:01.394 --> 02:49:02.935]  He goes on board, thumb scans.
[02:49:03.036 --> 02:49:04.977]  A camera watches him, face scans him.
[02:49:05.577 --> 02:49:06.278]  He sits down.
[02:49:07.208 --> 02:49:10.470]  You're not allowed to talk on the bus because we have to have discipline now on the right.
[02:49:10.490 --> 02:49:11.571]  We've had too many problems.
[02:49:12.932 --> 02:49:13.912]  And then you go to school.
[02:49:15.393 --> 02:49:24.459]  And his first period class, he sits there and watches a government broadcast for 20 minutes about the terrorists that are everywhere and how guns should be illegal and how homeschooling is bad.
[02:49:24.499 --> 02:49:29.322]  He'll show you a long train of the right-wingers who've been arrested who were supposedly working with Al-Qaeda.
[02:49:30.603 --> 02:49:32.044]  He'll show a public execution.
[02:49:33.099 --> 02:49:38.382]  And there'll be a little newscast with the doctors saying torture's really good, and this is something that's needed.
[02:49:40.423 --> 02:49:53.031]  And then he will leave that class, and he will go to a BATF-funded class through a grant with the county sheriff, with a BATF officer, deputized county officer.
[02:49:54.269 --> 02:49:58.773]  We'll have them write in their journal about their family life and what they do and teach them techniques of law enforcement.
[02:49:59.133 --> 02:50:02.396]  Then they'll go on to social studies and learn how good the UN is and all this.
[02:50:03.017 --> 02:50:05.599]  Then lunchtime, they've got a thumb scan to get their school lunch.
[02:50:05.639 --> 02:50:06.540]  No cash allowed.
[02:50:07.781 --> 02:50:09.783]  Then when they leave school that day...
[02:50:10.876 --> 02:50:12.036]  And they get off the school bus.
[02:50:12.076 --> 02:50:14.457]  If they get off at the wrong place, they'll be arrested.
[02:50:14.697 --> 02:50:16.417]  That was in the Washington Post two years ago, by the way.
[02:50:16.457 --> 02:50:22.239]  A girl got off the bus at the wrong spot to get some french fries a block from her home and was later arrested.
[02:50:22.259 --> 02:50:24.139]  A 12-year-old honor student.
[02:50:26.080 --> 02:50:26.360]  Anyways.
[02:50:27.380 --> 02:50:28.360]  And this is the plan.
[02:50:28.940 --> 02:50:29.921]  We'll come back.
[02:50:29.961 --> 02:50:31.161]  I'll try to finish up with this.
[02:50:31.661 --> 02:50:37.182]  We'll try to at least get you to supper time with this young man and the life he's going to be leading.
[02:50:38.803 --> 02:50:39.663]  So we'll be right back.
[02:50:39.703 --> 02:50:40.263]  Please stay with us.
[02:50:45.262 --> 02:50:49.584]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:50:49.784 --> 02:50:54.206]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:50:54.346 --> 02:50:58.728]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:50:58.768 --> 02:51:00.109]  The New World Order.
[02:51:01.910 --> 02:51:06.135]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:51:06.195 --> 02:51:13.123]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:51:13.263 --> 02:51:15.266]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:51:15.646 --> 02:51:25.973]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:51:26.253 --> 02:51:31.597]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:53:46.172 --> 02:53:48.896]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[02:53:48.916 --> 02:53:52.862]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:53:54.986 --> 02:53:59.072]  I was going over the average day of a high school student five years from now and...
[02:53:59.938 --> 02:54:02.119]  During the break, I thought that I didn't give you really the big picture.
[02:54:02.680 --> 02:54:03.940]  He goes through metal detectors.
[02:54:03.960 --> 02:54:05.181]  There's a fence outside.
[02:54:05.221 --> 02:54:06.402]  He has to swipe his card.
[02:54:06.422 --> 02:54:07.883]  Then he goes through security guards.
[02:54:08.363 --> 02:54:09.924]  There's a drug raid on the school.
[02:54:09.964 --> 02:54:12.905]  They all have to stand at attention, have their bags searched.
[02:54:13.366 --> 02:54:16.968]  There's cameras in the school bathrooms, which is now in hundreds of school districts.
[02:54:18.188 --> 02:54:20.750]  Cameras videotape him using the restroom.
[02:54:21.410 --> 02:54:22.931]  They're also in the school showers.
[02:54:23.171 --> 02:54:25.192]  By the way, I have mainstream articles where that's happening.
[02:54:25.332 --> 02:54:25.873]  It's good.
[02:54:25.893 --> 02:54:27.153]  It was good in 1984.
[02:54:27.374 --> 02:54:27.874]  It's good here.
[02:54:29.617 --> 02:54:30.298]  We're good to go.
[02:54:30.318 --> 02:54:30.598]  I think?
[02:54:46.678 --> 02:54:50.180]  And then he gets off the school bus and decides to go to the corner store.
[02:54:50.220 --> 02:54:57.825]  He goes in the corner store and swipes his ID card when he buys a soft drink, because you have to swipe that because of the new national sales tax.
[02:54:58.245 --> 02:55:04.670]  They have to look at his income and proportion the payment to be fair according to his income.
[02:55:06.631 --> 02:55:09.092]  And, again, I thought of a bunch of other stuff they'll be doing.
[02:55:09.193 --> 02:55:10.754]  All public stuff is being implemented.
[02:55:12.034 --> 02:55:14.476]  This will be the average day in the life of a young person.
[02:55:16.073 --> 02:55:19.095]  It's all part of the homeland.
[02:55:43.581 --> 02:55:45.882]  And that could go on and on for hour after hour.
[02:55:47.222 --> 02:55:52.064]  And it's all going to happen, unless we stand up and say, no, these are the official federal plans.
[02:55:53.444 --> 02:55:56.345]  This is the program of total control.
[02:55:57.985 --> 02:56:00.786]  And if you're a police officer, ooh, your day is going to be really tough.
[02:56:01.947 --> 02:56:05.208]  I mean, you're going to have the implanted chip in your hand for the safety.
[02:56:05.228 --> 02:56:06.888]  You know, you want to be an officer, you've got to do it.
[02:56:08.689 --> 02:56:08.789]  And...
[02:56:10.984 --> 02:56:24.893]  You're going to be out there running lots of checkpoints and raiding lots of homes and arresting lots of homeschooler families and helping with forced inoculations with people that have refused and lots of clandestine surveillance, but you better keep your mouth shut.
[02:56:24.913 --> 02:56:25.774]  You could get arrested.
[02:56:26.394 --> 02:56:28.956]  Just last week, your partner got in trouble.
[02:56:28.976 --> 02:56:31.177]  Now there's questions of, is he with Al-Qaeda?
[02:56:31.197 --> 02:56:32.998]  Because he criticized some of the policies.
[02:56:34.899 --> 02:56:37.241]  This is the norm in the world, is tyranny.
[02:56:37.301 --> 02:56:38.742]  Now we have this overlay of,
[02:56:39.423 --> 02:56:39.923]  We're good to go.
[02:56:39.963 --> 02:56:40.823]  We're good to go.
[02:56:40.843 --> 02:56:41.343]  We're good to go.
[02:56:41.363 --> 02:56:42.004]  We're good to go.
[02:57:06.091 --> 02:57:08.312]  You need to get my films.
[02:57:08.352 --> 02:57:12.473]  You need to get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove to find out what Skull and Bones is really all about.
[02:57:12.933 --> 02:57:18.995]  You need to get America Destroyed by Design to see the UN taking over our national parks and the police state.
[02:57:19.555 --> 02:57:23.296]  Or Police State 2000, Police State Do the Takeover, Police State Three Total Enslavement.
[02:57:23.556 --> 02:57:28.558]  My newest film, Matrix of Evil Exposed, where Ron Paul talks about the issues I'm discussing.
[02:57:29.698 --> 02:57:33.139]  Colonel Craig Roberts, Cynthia McKinney, Frank Morales, myself.
[02:57:34.164 --> 02:57:36.445]  You need to get my book, 9-11 Descent into Tyranny.
[02:57:36.465 --> 02:57:47.310]  If you want to find out the truth about 9-11, get my book, but also get 9-11 The Road to Tyranny, the video, two and a half hours long, or part two of that video, The Masters of Terror Exposed.

[02:58:35.680 --> 02:58:44.303]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling clean water possible.

[02:58:56.007 --> 02:58:58.648]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:58:59.008 --> 02:59:05.471]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[02:59:05.631 --> 02:59:07.492]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[02:59:07.692 --> 02:59:13.715]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[02:59:13.975 --> 02:59:19.638]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
