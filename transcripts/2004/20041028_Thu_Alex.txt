[00:00:05.774 --> 00:00:06.414]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:08.134]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.855 --> 00:00:09.955]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.595 --> 00:00:11.475]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.175 --> 00:00:13.095]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.576 --> 00:00:17.416]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.916 --> 00:00:22.077]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.518 --> 00:00:27.918]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:32.839]  It's already Thursday, the 28th day of October 2004.
[00:00:37.256 --> 00:00:39.197]  Did you see that eclipse last night?
[00:00:39.217 --> 00:00:42.498]  It was amazing.
[00:00:42.918 --> 00:00:46.919]  And then there was some other article saying that there'd be an eclipse on Halloween.
[00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:48.379]  That's confusing.
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:56.202]  I guess the mainstream media got it wrong again, but I was walking along last night and looked up and there's the eclipse.
[00:00:56.562 --> 00:00:58.302]  Anyways, side issue.
[00:00:59.643 --> 00:01:03.744]  The real news is the election coming up on Tuesday, as you know.
[00:01:05.632 --> 00:01:12.116]  And we also, of course, have the Iraq war degenerating on a daily basis.
[00:01:13.777 --> 00:01:14.718]  And I got this email.
[00:01:14.758 --> 00:01:19.981]  You know, I mentioned how Senator Harkin said that, well, Bush is going to need a draft.
[00:01:21.182 --> 00:01:30.008]  And we just posted the article, and somebody sent me an email saying, you better stop posting stuff that communists have to say, or I'm not going to listen to you.
[00:01:31.804 --> 00:01:36.826]  And I rarely talk about criticism from the mainstream media, but criticism from listeners on stuff like that.
[00:01:37.366 --> 00:01:38.626]  What do you expect us to do?
[00:01:38.686 --> 00:01:44.028]  That's newsworthy when a senator is saying something like that, even though they are one of the biggest liberals in Congress.
[00:01:44.068 --> 00:01:44.869]  It doesn't matter.
[00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:46.889]  It's about the news and information.
[00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:48.370]  It's about what people are saying.
[00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:51.671]  You know, we post up on the website that Fidel Castro sang.
[00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:53.752]  I don't like Fidel Castro.
[00:01:55.552 --> 00:02:00.454]  We've even posted a Joseph Goebbels speech on the website to show how much his propaganda...
[00:02:01.421 --> 00:02:04.043]  Is mirrored by this current White House.
[00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:06.665]  Does that mean we like Joseph Goebbels?
[00:02:08.326 --> 00:02:10.387]  I don't know, just another side issue we'll talk about.
[00:02:11.167 --> 00:02:12.568]  But some big news here.
[00:02:12.648 --> 00:02:15.310]  Tuesday they found 9-11 black boxes.
[00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.392]  This is out of the Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:02:18.512 --> 00:02:21.234]  It's on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:21.734 --> 00:02:24.936]  Two men who worked extensively in the records of the World Trade Center claim...
[00:02:25.706 --> 00:02:41.683]  That they and federal agents found three or four black boxes from the jetliners that struck the towers, contradicting the official account, both the independent 9-11 commission, again, independent folks, appointed by Bush,
[00:02:42.947 --> 00:02:53.430]  And federal authorities insist that none of the cockpit voice recorders, or CVRs, and flight data recorders, FDRs, from the two planes survived.
[00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:03.712]  But, of course, we know they're designed to survive that, and that we've always speculated they did survive, but, of course, we're not going to release that, because they don't want us to know what really happened.
[00:03:04.292 --> 00:03:11.434]  And now we have New York City firefighter Nicholas DeMasi has written a book, self-published, and...
[00:03:13.351 --> 00:03:26.784]  It claims that federal agents took away the black boxes on all terrain four-wheelers out of the wreckage, and his account is backed by a well-known Ground Zero volunteer.
[00:03:28.245 --> 00:03:32.129]  So we'll be going over this report today as well.
[00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.353]  Meanwhile, Drudge is reporting CIA, FBI authenticate...
[00:03:37.151 --> 00:03:39.852]  New LCIA to terror tape.
[00:03:40.432 --> 00:03:45.433]  ABC News executives consider political implications of airing it.
[00:03:46.773 --> 00:03:49.034]  Now, how many fake Al-Qaeda tapes have been put out?
[00:03:49.514 --> 00:03:54.275]  Then it comes out a month later that they were fake, but that's retracted on page A10.
[00:03:54.875 --> 00:03:56.996]  In small print, no one ever sees it.
[00:03:59.511 --> 00:04:09.574]  And so more of these terror alerts, and most of them have been completely fake, and then you look at the real ones, the real terror attacks, those have government fingerprints literally all over them.
[00:04:10.554 --> 00:04:26.259]  Coming up in this first hour, we're going to talk to Dr. Vivian Nathanson, head of the science and ethics at the BMA, British Medical Association, talking about gene wars, race-specific bioweapons.
[00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:27.840]  That's a pretty serious issue.
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:28.640]  We'll be discussing it.
[00:04:29.552 --> 00:04:32.415]  Also, seven homeschooler dads thrown in jail.
[00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:37.999]  Families fined for refusing to send children to government institutions.
[00:04:39.781 --> 00:04:42.102]  An article out of the Daily Northwestern.
[00:04:42.703 --> 00:04:44.384]  Skull and Bones Showdown.
[00:04:44.404 --> 00:04:48.187]  More on the National ID Guard.
[00:04:49.388 --> 00:04:50.949]  And just so much more.
[00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.093]  We've got Bev Harris from Black Box Voting joining us in the next hour.
[00:04:56.227 --> 00:05:00.229]  Ultra-massive broadcasts have lined up, so please stay with us.
[00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:07.712]  Maca is a small turnip-like root plant that grows at 12,000 to 14,000 feet on the Andes Mountains in Peru.
[00:05:08.072 --> 00:05:12.174]  The tuberous plant benefits from the purest air, sunlight, and rain in the world.
[00:05:12.674 --> 00:05:19.877]  Only recently has science discovered that Maca is a living storehouse with an extraordinary range of vitamins, minerals, and sterols.
[00:05:20.417 --> 00:05:27.784]  Research has indicated both men and women can benefit from maca supplementation with increased energy, stamina, and endurance levels.
[00:05:28.124 --> 00:05:37.492]  Increased libido, which helps prevent impotence, relief of menopausal, premenstrual, and PMS discomfort, helps relieve or eliminate hot flashes and night sweats.
[00:05:37.812 --> 00:05:40.715]  It also helps prevent osteoporosis and joint pain.
[00:05:41.195 --> 00:05:49.382]  Get your maca from Cliff Scott Enterprises at a price and quality that few can match because we get our maca fresh from the growers in Peru.
[00:05:49.782 --> 00:05:51.664]  Call 800-569-4340 for incredible savings.
[00:05:51.744 --> 00:05:53.265]  Call 800-569-4340 or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[00:06:02.131 --> 00:06:11.197]  Now you can upgrade your existing gravity filter to remove chemicals such as triamethylenes, atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTVE to below detectable limits.
[00:06:11.437 --> 00:06:22.684]  Black Berkey elements are so powerful, they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels, and transform water, even raw stagnant pond water, into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:06:23.025 --> 00:06:28.268]  Nitrates, nitrites, radon-222, unwanted heavy metals like lead, mercury, and aluminum are no
[00:06:28.268 --> 00:06:29.089]  We're good to go.
[00:06:53.386 --> 00:06:53.566]  803-4438.
[00:06:53.606 --> 00:06:56.349]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:56.449 --> 00:06:59.312]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:00.393 --> 00:07:04.737]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:04.937 --> 00:07:09.342]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:09.502 --> 00:07:13.886]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:07:13.906 --> 00:07:15.248]  The New World Order.
[00:07:16.048 --> 00:07:16.989]  Panama.
[00:07:17.049 --> 00:07:21.272]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.332 --> 00:07:28.256]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.376 --> 00:07:30.418]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:30.758 --> 00:07:41.145]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.405 --> 00:07:45.128]  If you want to understand what the new order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video,
[00:07:45.768 --> 00:07:47.208]  Big Brother.
[00:07:47.248 --> 00:07:48.089]  Mainstream media.
[00:07:48.109 --> 00:07:48.809]  Government cover-ups.
[00:07:48.829 --> 00:07:49.489]  You want answers?
[00:07:49.509 --> 00:07:50.029]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.595 --> 00:08:17.718]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.958 --> 00:08:22.061]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:28.446 --> 00:08:31.809]  Firefighters and rescue workers.
[00:08:35.572 --> 00:08:41.176]  From the World Trade Center complex scene.
[00:08:42.791 --> 00:08:55.715]  Are now going public saying that all of the black boxes, there's two per plane, the data recorder, the audio recorders, were found intact in the rubble.
[00:08:56.996 --> 00:09:04.038]  And that they were whisked away on those four-wheelers that they had buzzing in and out of the tangled slag heap.
[00:09:05.959 --> 00:09:09.140]  Now again, they have designed these flight recorders
[00:09:10.586 --> 00:09:19.588]  To bake inside ovens at thousands of degrees of temperature for many, many hours and not be damaged.
[00:09:21.268 --> 00:09:38.912]  But whether it's TWA, Flight 800, or any of these big disasters where it's obviously terrorism, the Queens, New York crash just a few weeks after 9-11, in every case they go, oh, the data recorders were destroyed, or...
[00:09:39.617 --> 00:09:41.678]  The dotted recorders were lost.
[00:09:41.738 --> 00:09:52.262]  Well, they say that they located the boxes and that they watched them be loaded onto four-wheelers and driven out of there.
[00:09:53.642 --> 00:09:56.783]  Now, this gets into a wider area of discussion.
[00:09:57.303 --> 00:10:06.847]  There were 12, at least 12, some say 14, but confirmed 12 video cameras connected to
[00:10:08.286 --> 00:10:25.317]  VCRs that were recording from bank buildings, the YMCA, the federal building itself, that were with Oklahoma City, videotaping what happened.
[00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:29.520]  And FBI agents have told the LA Times that it chose McVeigh with Arabs.
[00:10:31.281 --> 00:10:37.926]  And we have interviewed these individuals, and we have the interviews in 9-11, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:10:38.621 --> 00:10:40.622]  We have the mainstream news articles as well.
[00:10:41.723 --> 00:10:54.891]  I have interviewed the lawyers who sued the government two separate times to get those tapes so they could then sue Saudi Arabia and Iraq and others and they were blocked under national security.
[00:10:57.953 --> 00:10:59.734]  And it's the same thing with the Pentagon.
[00:10:59.754 --> 00:11:05.958]  You've got at least three hotels with multiple cameras aimed right at the area that was supposedly hit by that flight.
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:23.712]  You have several gas stations, and you have literally hundreds of cameras on the Pentagon, and even mainstream media reports say 40 cameras aiming off the face of the Pentagon in the area where the plane came from.
[00:11:25.073 --> 00:11:27.975]  And all they've got to do is release this video of McVeigh.
[00:11:28.895 --> 00:11:32.918]  The FBI came and seized those tapes and declared national security.
[00:11:33.579 --> 00:11:35.320]  Well, if it shows McVeigh by himself...
[00:11:36.195 --> 00:11:38.316]  Oh, why don't you just use them to convict him?
[00:11:38.696 --> 00:11:40.577]  Wow, imagine showing that on the news.
[00:11:41.797 --> 00:12:02.985]  If you've got footage of this plane, and there's all these conspiracy theories about how a Boeing didn't hit the Pentagon and the construction area, then why did the FBI go in, and again, they've been interviewed, into the hotels under national security and grab those tapes away from people and threaten them with a national security arrest if they talk about what they saw on the tapes?
[00:12:05.345 --> 00:12:16.716]  Why did they declare that all the firefighters and police radios malfunctioned on 9-11, and so there's no tapes of what the firemen and police said in the towers?
[00:12:18.118 --> 00:12:27.508]  Now, I said day one, that is utterly ridiculous, that is impossible, and then it came out in the New York Daily News, what, two years ago, a year into the cover-up, that...
[00:12:28.095 --> 00:12:30.176]  Firefighters got mad and released transcripts.
[00:12:30.216 --> 00:12:32.437]  Some of them had saved the tapes, hadn't destroyed them.
[00:12:32.957 --> 00:12:35.017]  And it was, the fires are almost out.
[00:12:35.478 --> 00:12:36.678]  We're moving in new ladders.
[00:12:36.998 --> 00:12:37.178]  What?
[00:12:37.338 --> 00:12:37.718]  Bombs!
[00:12:38.239 --> 00:12:38.499]  Bombs!
[00:12:38.519 --> 00:12:39.179]  We've got bombs!
[00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:42.120]  And then the feds got scared because they had their audio sensors inside.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:47.482]  They were across the street in Building 7 at the CIA command base, which has admittedly had microphones and cameras in the buildings.
[00:12:47.802 --> 00:12:49.723]  And they hit the destruct button a little bit early.
[00:12:49.743 --> 00:12:53.844]  They were going to let those spectacular smoking go on for a couple more hours.
[00:12:53.884 --> 00:12:56.145]  The firefighters, we've located what looks like explosives.
[00:12:57.754 --> 00:13:00.155]  Evacuate!
[00:13:00.275 --> 00:13:03.015]  This is your loving government, folks, and it's admitted.
[00:13:04.095 --> 00:13:20.499]  And so now, now they've always been saying the flight recorders just magically burned into cinders, which you look at the steel didn't, but the super reinforced boxes did, and now...
[00:13:22.628 --> 00:13:27.189]  Some of the head firefighters and head rescue workers says very highly respected.
[00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:29.710]  Individuals are going, we're sick and tired of this.
[00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:39.513]  We loaded four flight recorders on the backs of four wheelers and the FBI drove off with them.
[00:13:39.533 --> 00:13:50.796]  And then when we do have photographic evidence, the flare footage did get leaked by sources in the government and then a CIA director had a canoeing accident the next day, a kayaking accident after it got released.
[00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.034]  You know, we've had on the sources who it was released to.
[00:13:54.054 --> 00:13:56.559]  It came right out of the CIA.
[00:13:57.922 --> 00:14:02.010]  And then once the clear footage is out, the government goes, okay, we're releasing it, but like a 10th generation copy.
[00:14:02.774 --> 00:14:06.676]  And they go, those little flashes from the ends of guns, that's just glitter on the ground.
[00:14:06.997 --> 00:14:18.283]  You watch every other piece of footage over the last 20 years, 30 years since flare's been used, forward infrared looking radar, and that's the same Christmas tree flashes from the guns.
[00:14:18.343 --> 00:14:20.765]  And they go, well, just ignore that.
[00:14:21.125 --> 00:14:27.128]  You didn't see machine guns, and you didn't see us throwing incendiary devices into the building.
[00:14:27.288 --> 00:14:28.189]  Just ignore that.
[00:14:28.469 --> 00:14:30.030]  A guy rolling out of the back of the tank,
[00:14:30.796 --> 00:14:34.101]  Firing with a machine gun, walking forward, and throwing in a hand grenade.
[00:14:35.142 --> 00:14:39.128]  You didn't see what you just saw with your own two eyes.
[00:14:39.148 --> 00:14:40.049]  You didn't see that.
[00:14:40.350 --> 00:14:41.191]  So shut up.
[00:14:42.324 --> 00:14:47.665]  Joining us just for a few minutes here, and I appreciate it, is Paul Watson to go over this Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:14:47.685 --> 00:14:51.986]  Because I'll be honest with you, I didn't hit the printer friendly and the article's cut in half.
[00:14:52.046 --> 00:14:57.427]  I read it this morning and I was babbling through it last segment trying to decipher the last two words of every line.
[00:14:57.867 --> 00:15:01.507]  So Paul's here to read this for us and then of course give us his comment.
[00:15:01.567 --> 00:15:05.088]  Paul, thank you for helping me because of my oversight.
[00:15:05.128 --> 00:15:05.468]  Welcome.
[00:15:06.068 --> 00:15:06.568]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:15:08.268 --> 00:15:09.689]  You've got the Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:15:09.729 --> 00:15:11.629]  First off, what do you think about this new development?
[00:15:13.112 --> 00:15:14.873]  Well, it's definitely interesting.
[00:15:15.454 --> 00:15:28.945]  You know, they tell us that at least two of it is now the paper passports of the hijackers were found both on the streets of New York and the eight mile wide debris field in Pennsylvania.
[00:15:29.885 --> 00:15:36.450]  And yet, you know, we're supposed to believe that the black boxes, which are basically indestructible, were never found.
[00:15:36.510 --> 00:15:39.553]  And obviously this article points towards the direction in which
[00:15:40.276 --> 00:15:46.884]  They were found, and obviously the contents of those black boxes will be very revealing in terms of what's on them.
[00:15:47.084 --> 00:15:52.771]  I mean, we've had the phone calls, supposedly, which were brought out in the 9-11 Commission report.
[00:15:52.791 --> 00:15:59.419]  We've had the hijackers' voices supposedly heard over the voice recorders in the cockpit.
[00:16:00.367 --> 00:16:12.115]  And so, again, that's to back up the storyboard which they created before 9-11, which encapsulates the official version of events, which was that 19 hijackers pulled this off.
[00:16:13.075 --> 00:16:27.405]  Now, if these black boxes, which are obviously part of this cover-up, don't have Arab voices on them, then it would lend credence to a different explanation that, as people like Stanley Hilton have put forward, that
[00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:29.450]  There were no hijackers.
[00:16:30.111 --> 00:16:38.397]  Some kind of gas was used to knock out the pilots and the passengers and then the planes were flown via remote control into their targets.
[00:16:38.477 --> 00:16:39.618]  That'll be specific.
[00:16:40.248 --> 00:16:40.968]  We're good to go.
[00:16:40.988 --> 00:16:41.168]  I think?
[00:17:03.559 --> 00:17:04.199]  Well, yes.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:10.323]  At least the ringleaders, the people who were supposedly flying the planes, they would have been direct government agents.
[00:17:10.343 --> 00:17:11.603]  And then you've got the possibility...
[00:17:27.771 --> 00:17:48.955]  Of the other so-called hijackers who didn't believe that it was a suicide mission, because there were many reports emerged from people like Zacharias Moussaoui, who was kind of tangentially in on the plot on the outside, who thought, you know, it wasn't a suicide mission, it was just a hijack mission and then a hostage situation, so...
[00:17:50.037 --> 00:18:09.891]  They may have killed some of the hijackers on board who were basically useful idiots and then, you know, the ringleaders were actually not on the planes at all, so... Well, this is going to be a big problem for the globalists because they were doing these drills, these simulations in real time with real people to, quote, test the response of law enforcement at every level.
[00:18:10.531 --> 00:18:14.314]  And so, of course, they had with their informants some patsies and with their Arabs...
[00:18:14.814 --> 00:18:19.319]  I suppose that Hijacker's out making contacts, trying to see what was going on out there.
[00:18:19.339 --> 00:18:22.903]  These guys were actually thinking they were serving the American interest.
[00:18:24.164 --> 00:18:27.968]  Really hired Arab mercenaries, hired to come over here and be part of these drills.
[00:18:28.747 --> 00:18:34.611]  But some of them from the evidence were actually American patriots, people who wanted to work with the West, a very secular people.
[00:18:35.511 --> 00:18:38.093]  But they found out real quick who they were really working for.
[00:18:38.533 --> 00:18:45.917]  But this is going to hurt the system as more and more people in their own system go public and say the whole thing's a fraud.
[00:18:46.278 --> 00:18:53.722]  I mean, at what step of the 9-11 whitewash have we not proven everything they say to be 180 degrees opposite from the truth?
[00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:56.271]  Well, that's exactly the case.
[00:18:56.371 --> 00:19:05.017]  The evidence that they've presented is the most outrageous coincidence theory that you could possibly imagine.
[00:19:05.858 --> 00:19:10.661]  We've proven every point of the case to be completely the opposite, as you've said.
[00:19:11.322 --> 00:19:19.668]  I mean, Tony Blair came out in the days after 9-11 and said there'll be a court case where we present all the evidence that these 19 Arabs were involved.
[00:19:20.328 --> 00:19:21.269]  That never happened.
[00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:23.531]  And so now they have to resort to
[00:19:24.798 --> 00:19:28.381]  Well, I'll tell you what, Paul.
[00:19:28.441 --> 00:19:28.981]  Stay there.
[00:19:29.001 --> 00:19:32.724]  When we get back, I want you to just read the article, because again, I...
[00:19:47.519 --> 00:19:50.723]  I have the printer, unfriendly version here, and part of it's cut off.
[00:19:50.763 --> 00:19:59.374]  I want you to come back, just read over some of the articles, some of the people involved, a firefighter, Nicholas Damaschi and others, who are exposing this, and we'll let you get back to work.
[00:19:59.634 --> 00:20:00.195]  We'll be right back.
[00:20:01.886 --> 00:20:04.767]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[00:20:05.127 --> 00:20:07.987]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[00:20:08.227 --> 00:20:14.429]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[00:20:14.809 --> 00:20:22.110]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:26.271]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophes.

[00:21:01.405 --> 00:21:05.306]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:05.526 --> 00:21:17.810]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.630]  The U.S.
[00:21:18.670 --> 00:21:24.272]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:24.652 --> 00:21:26.873]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:28.733 --> 00:21:29.213]  We're good to go.
[00:21:49.583 --> 00:21:53.586]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:21:53.706 --> 00:21:53.906]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:53.926 --> 00:21:54.126]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:11.005 --> 00:22:17.889]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:27.555]  If so, why has Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[00:22:28.655 --> 00:22:36.620]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch magazine.

[00:23:00.743 --> 00:23:03.786]  You and your family members gaining enough minerals on the daily diet?
[00:23:04.286 --> 00:23:06.668]  Not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[00:23:06.888 --> 00:23:13.954]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:23:14.154 --> 00:23:19.719]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:23:20.079 --> 00:23:27.886]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:23:28.066 --> 00:23:28.726]  We're good to go.
[00:24:08.415 --> 00:24:14.460]  All right, in about 15 minutes, we're going to shift gears back to this article out of the Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:24:16.061 --> 00:24:24.649]  Firefighters, emergency workers say they loaded the black boxes into government vehicles, and this is now mainstream.
[00:24:25.805 --> 00:24:29.827]  From the 9-11 crash site in New York, but the government says nothing was ever found.
[00:24:29.867 --> 00:24:31.007]  It was all destroyed.
[00:24:31.407 --> 00:24:34.228]  So we'll have Paul Watson back on with us here in about 15 minutes.
[00:24:34.709 --> 00:24:42.652]  Right now, I'm very honored to have Dr. Vivian Nathanson, head of science and ethics at the BMA, British Medical Association.
[00:24:43.436 --> 00:24:52.162]  In an article titled, that she was interviewed for by the London Times, Gene Wars, only a few years away, say doctors.
[00:24:52.402 --> 00:25:08.193]  Now, about two years ago, Jane's Weapons Quarterly, the most respected weapons analyst organization on the planet, put out a worldwide alert saying the Western world is already covertly developing this, but now the third world can even get it.
[00:25:09.014 --> 00:25:15.815]  And one of the PNAC documents from 2000, Dick Cheney talked about legitimizing the use of race-specific bioweapons.
[00:25:16.455 --> 00:25:26.357]  And a British member of Parliament, Michael Meacher, even wrote an article for The Guardian, of course our media didn't, saying how dangerous it was that there was now open discussion of this.
[00:25:26.777 --> 00:25:33.678]  I'm not sure if Dr. Vivian Nathanson was aware of those developments, but she's on the cutting edge of exposing what's going on with this.
[00:25:34.478 --> 00:25:37.079]  And Dr. Vivian Nathanson, good to have you on with us.
[00:25:37.619 --> 00:25:38.159]  Nice to be here.
[00:25:39.342 --> 00:25:45.287]  Just for those that don't know what race-specific bioweapons are, can you explain it to us?
[00:25:45.888 --> 00:26:05.725]  Yes, what we're looking at here is the fact that because of a lot of medical research, we're identifying those things in our genes that are common within extended family groups or ethnic groups, because that will allow us to target medicines at people who have particular problems, many kinds of diseases which are common in particular ethnic groups.
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:26.466]  But the trouble is that that same technology, the ability to target these common genes, would allow us to target something which would cause harm, whether it's a germ that would be activated in the presence of those genes or something that would modify the way our body works, what we call bioregulators, because either of those would be biological weapons.
[00:26:26.546 --> 00:26:34.769]  I mean, currently banned under international law, but the question is whether the law is strong enough or effective enough to make sure that people don't use them.
[00:26:36.354 --> 00:26:54.869]  Well, I mean, Bush just got $6 billion or $5.8 billion of funding this year for BioShield, and they claim these three dozen level four bioweapons labs, by the way, one very close to where I live, unfortunately, and they're building new ones, that it's, quote, for treatment and investigation of it.
[00:26:55.329 --> 00:27:00.053]  But then the experts look at it and go, no, these are biological weapons development labs.
[00:27:00.373 --> 00:27:06.557]  I mean, obviously, they also have the dual use for developing treatments and cures, but that's not the direction they're going in.
[00:27:06.597 --> 00:27:11.961]  I mean, this is a Pandora's box that could make the nuclear bomb look like a toy.
[00:27:12.581 --> 00:27:19.907]  Yeah, I mean, this is a real problem, because the thing about nuclear weapons is it's actually quite difficult to get hold of weapons-grade radioactive material.
[00:27:20.687 --> 00:27:24.410]  The problem with biological weapons, or indeed chemical weapons, is that the
[00:27:24.966 --> 00:27:29.188]  The basic materials that you need are actually relatively easy to get hold of.
[00:27:29.208 --> 00:27:37.090]  I mean, in the past, we've been protected because things like actually getting rid of the smallpox, getting hold of the smallpox virus has been difficult.
[00:27:37.511 --> 00:27:43.993]  But increasingly, scientists can actually now manufacture viruses from scraps of RNA or DNA.
[00:27:44.013 --> 00:27:47.634]  I mean, poliovirus was the first one to be manufactured in that way.
[00:27:48.154 --> 00:27:49.775]  And what we have to recognise is
[00:27:50.493 --> 00:27:55.215]  Is that it's A, going to be easier, B, going to be cheaper because of a lot of automation and so on.
[00:27:55.495 --> 00:28:03.959]  And the other thing is that the overlap between what's called defensive research and offensive research is extremely narrow.
[00:28:04.059 --> 00:28:12.582]  Sure, if you want to defend against things, you need to know how people using them as weapons would make them, what they would do so that you can defend that.
[00:28:12.682 --> 00:28:17.124]  But the real key to all of this is that the only real defense is prevention.
[00:28:18.809 --> 00:28:22.311]  Well, I would say the only real defense is not allowing the development of these periods.
[00:28:22.371 --> 00:28:22.771]  Absolutely.
[00:28:23.291 --> 00:28:24.471]  That's what I mean by prevention.
[00:28:24.752 --> 00:28:26.072]  Stopping people from making them.
[00:28:26.312 --> 00:28:28.613]  And that requires three different things, we think.
[00:28:29.013 --> 00:28:36.897]  It needs international action, which is that we have this convention, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, and that needs to be given real international teeth.
[00:28:37.437 --> 00:28:44.220]  It needs to have UN inspectorates and all the rest of it so that people can go in and inspect labs and seize suspect material.
[00:28:44.778 --> 00:28:53.685]  We also need to have national legislation in every country so that the manufacture of such weapons would be such a serious criminal offense that it would really put people off.
[00:28:54.346 --> 00:29:05.835]  And thirdly, we need a kind of web of deterrence involving scientists monitoring what they're doing, what people in their labs are doing, what people are doing in other labs, because that's the best way of raising the standards.
[00:29:05.875 --> 00:29:08.978]  If you put those three things together, we have a real chance
[00:29:09.646 --> 00:29:12.268]  Well, it's the sword of Damocles held over all of our necks.
[00:29:12.288 --> 00:29:15.450]  We're talking to Dr. Vivian Nathanson, head of the Science and Ethics Department.
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.021]  For the British Medical Association.
[00:29:32.521 --> 00:29:33.982]  Can you stay with us for another segment?
[00:29:34.382 --> 00:29:34.762]  Yes, sir.
[00:29:34.962 --> 00:29:36.143]  Okay, we're honored to have you.
[00:29:36.163 --> 00:29:38.223]  We're going to break here for three short minutes.
[00:29:38.243 --> 00:29:40.644]  We're going to come back to Dr. Vivian Nathanson.
[00:29:41.245 --> 00:29:44.006]  Then we'll go back to England again and talk to Paul Watson.
[00:29:44.666 --> 00:29:50.429]  Get his take on this Philadelphia Daily News article about the black boxes from 9-11 found.
[00:29:50.709 --> 00:29:51.309]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.709 --> 00:29:52.629]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:54.710]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.631 --> 00:29:58.292]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:01.721]  I think?
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.662]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[00:30:33.832 --> 00:30:37.234]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:30:37.394 --> 00:30:40.957]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[00:31:01.644 --> 00:31:07.908]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:08.028 --> 00:31:14.192]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:14.472 --> 00:31:22.858]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:23.158 --> 00:31:30.202]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:30.483 --> 00:31:35.305]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.

[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:08.961]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:11.942 --> 00:33:12.842]  That's right, my friends.
[00:33:12.922 --> 00:33:16.043]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:16.063 --> 00:33:20.084]  We're just about five days out now from the big election.
[00:33:20.104 --> 00:33:31.888]  We've got election coverage coming up in detail with Bev Harris from Black Box Voting exposing all the voting machine problems that have already popped up in early voting and her predictions in the next hour.
[00:33:33.357 --> 00:33:42.281]  Right now we're joined by a prestigious doctor, Dr. Vivian Nathanson, head of the Science and Ethics at the British Medical Association.
[00:33:42.681 --> 00:33:47.864]  Headline of the London Times, Gene Wars only a few years away, say doctors.
[00:33:47.944 --> 00:33:49.565]  And the article says that the...
[00:33:50.525 --> 00:33:57.229]  Although the BMA insists that genetic weapons have yet to be built, it concluded that their construction is now approaching reality.
[00:33:57.589 --> 00:34:08.955]  If a genetic bomb was developed, it could contain anthrax of the plague and be tailored to activate when it identified a certain group of genes, indicating membership of a particular ethnic group of the infected person.
[00:34:09.535 --> 00:34:12.197]  Folks, we know South Africa developed stuff like this.
[00:34:13.452 --> 00:34:22.378]  Again, Jane's Weapons Quarterly, who told us about the B-2 bomber years before it was rolled out on the tarmac at the Skunk's Works, they've said this stuff's already been made.
[00:34:24.279 --> 00:34:28.141]  Again, our government says, well, we haven't really made it, we're just studying it.
[00:34:29.122 --> 00:34:35.665]  And there's been a lot of articles saying, and Doctor, comment on what I was just saying.
[00:34:37.527 --> 00:34:41.589]  The reality is here that we never know exactly what
[00:34:42.253 --> 00:34:55.661]  These research programs have been doing until much later, not least because most of our countries are signatories to the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and much of this research is at best questionable and in some cases frankly illegal.
[00:34:56.021 --> 00:35:03.886]  But we know for example that research was carried out after people signed the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention in the mid 70s.
[00:35:04.246 --> 00:35:07.047]  We know that the USSR had a huge biological weapons program.
[00:35:07.107 --> 00:35:08.008]  What's interesting
[00:35:08.636 --> 00:35:13.197]  is that one of the major lessons from that is that accidents will happen.
[00:35:13.217 --> 00:35:32.421]  It's not only the deliberate release but accidental release of anthrax in the USSR killed nearly 80 people in a local town and indeed even though it wasn't part of a biological weapons research program it was a smallpox release, accidental release from a hospital in Britain that gave us our last case also in the 1970s.
[00:35:32.901 --> 00:35:37.542]  So these are very dangerous agents but there are interesting issues here about
[00:35:38.317 --> 00:36:04.627]  Do we as members of society think they should be used particularly if we could find non-lethal versions because one of the things we find most worrying is politicians and international commentators saying maybe we should look for biological weapons that are not usually lethal and use those and change the law so that it's legitimate to use those and we find that very worrying because of course you can never guarantee that the weapon is not lethal
[00:36:05.014 --> 00:36:08.518]  Well, it's just like they're using depleted uranium now in three nations, twice in Iraq, four times.
[00:36:22.391 --> 00:36:32.160]  When it's going to be around for millions of years, and it admittedly is killing Iraqis, Serbs, our troops, Afghans, our troops there as well, multinational force getting sick from it.
[00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:33.581]  We know that's happening.
[00:36:33.601 --> 00:36:34.382]  They're still using it.
[00:36:34.722 --> 00:36:39.106]  We know now they want to use mini-nukes all over the planet, which there's no such thing as a mini-nuke, folks.
[00:36:39.806 --> 00:36:44.809]  And then at the same time, our governments are racing ahead with these facilities.
[00:36:45.149 --> 00:36:49.031]  You didn't mention Porton Down with the foot-and-mouth release.
[00:36:50.172 --> 00:36:56.675]  According to British newspapers, that was released or stolen, they're not sure, from there, they claim.
[00:36:56.915 --> 00:37:00.978]  And then that story disappeared, so that's another example of this.
[00:37:02.273 --> 00:37:09.377]  I mean, this kind of stuff is happening all the time, and a lot of these releases get kept quiet from these Level 4 bioweapons labs.
[00:37:09.537 --> 00:37:16.361]  Have you seen any examples of that, kind of on your inside track, Doctor, as the Head of Science and Ethics at the BMA?
[00:37:16.902 --> 00:37:25.647]  No, we haven't seen any further ones than the ones which are well-known and heavily publicized, and particularly the results of the anthrax release in Russia.
[00:37:25.747 --> 00:37:28.008]  And I think that that is particularly significant.
[00:37:28.499 --> 00:37:52.079]  Because there's a lot of analysis now of how effective the cover-up was in terms of trying not to let people know what had happened despite the fact that tens of thousands of people in Russia were working for Biopreparat, which was the biological warfare prevention unit which was actually producing biological weapons.
[00:37:52.139 --> 00:37:55.722]  I mean, I think we have to accept that around the planet there are
[00:37:56.167 --> 00:37:59.788]  A lot of germs stored for good reason and for bad reason.
[00:37:59.828 --> 00:38:03.929]  There's stuff that's stored from previous biological weapons research.
[00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:17.191]  What's more worrying is the fact that genetic technology gives us the ability to manipulate old germs that we might have good vaccines or antibiotics or agents for and to make them more effective.
[00:38:17.671 --> 00:38:25.173]  We know that people, for example, at the moment are looking at the 1918 Spanish flu which killed somewhere between 20 and 40 million people worldwide.
[00:38:25.717 --> 00:38:27.398]  Now they're not doing it for bad reason.
[00:38:27.418 --> 00:38:43.264]  They're doing it because they're trying to learn more about that flu because we need to understand why that was so lethal because there's always the possibility that the kind of flu epidemics we see regularly could mutate back to something that lethal and we need to see what we could do to prevent it.
[00:38:43.605 --> 00:38:54.169]  But there has to be worries about if that kind of research is going on whether that agent, if we could kind of remanufacture 1918 flu, could be released by accident.
[00:38:54.774 --> 00:39:00.357]  And that's why a lot of the energy is going into safety systems.
[00:39:00.737 --> 00:39:04.079]  But we mustn't be fooled by just the safety systems.
[00:39:04.099 --> 00:39:06.760]  They'll never give us complete security and we also need...
[00:39:07.168 --> 00:39:10.730]  To deal with people who were deliberately released, not just the accidental release.
[00:39:11.090 --> 00:39:12.331]  It's a very complex thing.
[00:39:12.691 --> 00:39:15.413]  Well, you talked about releases, unintentional releases.
[00:39:15.873 --> 00:39:17.414]  And again, we have BioShield.
[00:39:18.335 --> 00:39:21.216]  University of Texas at Austin is doing a bunch of sneaky stuff.
[00:39:21.296 --> 00:39:22.757]  I know people in the biology department.
[00:39:22.777 --> 00:39:23.878]  They're not supposed to be doing it.
[00:39:24.238 --> 00:39:27.200]  It's not level four, but they're doing level four stuff, my friends.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:31.302]  They have a level four down at Galveston here in Texas.
[00:39:31.803 --> 00:39:35.385]  But then in other areas, they're saying they're going to have them in the middle of big cities in New York.
[00:39:36.085 --> 00:39:37.166]  We're good to go.
[00:39:58.945 --> 00:40:00.286]  Well, that always seems to worry.
[00:40:00.346 --> 00:40:02.508]  I mean, clearly, of course, part of the investment is in containment.
[00:40:02.528 --> 00:40:05.791]  It's about the fact that today we have very sophisticated systems for trying to stop accidental escapes.
[00:40:05.811 --> 00:40:06.312]  And the question is,
[00:40:24.193 --> 00:40:25.795]  Are they sufficiently secure?
[00:40:25.875 --> 00:40:27.216]  Are people confident of that?
[00:40:27.276 --> 00:40:32.701]  That's up to local city planners and to national and local government.
[00:40:32.721 --> 00:40:38.627]  I think of more significance in a sense than that is why are there so many units being set up?
[00:40:39.388 --> 00:40:48.657]  Is there enough investment in prevention of weapons use rather than this enormous, gigantic investment?
[00:40:49.373 --> 00:41:12.189]  In defensive, offensive research, or offensive, defensive research, whatever way you want to put it, because the question is whether we're spending the money in the best way to make the people of your country and of my country safe, and indeed all the people of the world safer, and I think that the biggest amount of money should be being spent on international law and international protection, because that will give us better protection.
[00:41:12.631 --> 00:41:19.121]  Well, again, Dr. Vivian Nathanson, head of the science and ethics at BMA, British Medical Association.
[00:41:19.522 --> 00:41:24.249]  Read the article at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[00:41:24.269 --> 00:41:25.471]  You can link through to the article.
[00:41:26.192 --> 00:41:27.414]  But, you know, Dr. Alex.
[00:41:29.071 --> 00:41:43.441]  Really boiling this down for people, you keep saying international, international, UN inspectors, overseeing, basically watching all the scientists in the world that are involved in this, and frankly, it's 2004.
[00:41:44.421 --> 00:41:46.663]  This stuff's only going to get more prolific.
[00:41:47.501 --> 00:42:08.389]  And so part one of the question is, the UN itself has been caught being so corrupt, so many internal payoffs, so much stuff going on, and at the same time, this is the argument for global government, is we've got to have this to stop these proliferations of chemical, biological, radiological stuff, or we're all going to be destroyed.
[00:42:08.949 --> 00:42:13.173]  But then, you know, these global bodies themselves have been involved in so much corruption.
[00:42:13.513 --> 00:42:29.926]  And then part two of that is IBM, in league with the government, with the human genome, is now making the human genome sequencing, as you know, I'm sure, available to more and more private companies who can then bootleg it out to whoever wants it.
[00:42:30.446 --> 00:42:35.891]  I mean, shouldn't the human genome project itself be a classified matter?
[00:42:36.963 --> 00:42:44.730]  Well, to answer the last question first, I mean, I think the key issue here is how do we keep science private and confidential?
[00:42:44.750 --> 00:42:50.895]  Because the answer is we probably can't because of the nature of the Internet and the nature of the information age in which we live.
[00:42:51.335 --> 00:42:54.138]  And the second side is if you do keep it quiet, what do we lose?
[00:42:54.198 --> 00:42:58.762]  Because what we lose is the ability of scientists in often fairly small centres
[00:42:59.133 --> 00:42:59.833]  Thank you very much.
[00:43:20.157 --> 00:43:48.063]  which say that we will watch what people are doing with that information as far as we're able and we'll try to build a global consensus so that nobody willingly gets into doing the kind of research which is deliberately set up to harm people and one can criticize the UN or other agencies but on the whole I think in the UK we tend to think of the UN in a far more positive way we think that it is actually an important contributor to the safety and security of the planet
[00:43:48.467 --> 00:44:01.293]  And we think that the Biological and Toxic Weapons Convention is incredibly important and that it isn't international inspection on its own which will give us safety, but it is a key part of the processes that we need to have in place.
[00:44:01.693 --> 00:44:04.534]  But we also need openness and transparency.
[00:44:04.594 --> 00:44:08.776]  We need laboratories to be willing to be inspected wherever they are in the world.
[00:44:08.997 --> 00:44:09.557]  What about IBM?
[00:44:11.227 --> 00:44:17.596]  What about IBM now with the human genome sequencing that it's publicly available now?
[00:44:18.117 --> 00:44:22.764]  But I think that it's inevitable that it would be and I think it's important that it was because again we get back to
[00:44:23.297 --> 00:44:30.622]  The necessity for that information is a powerful tool for people doing research because this is the problem with this technology.
[00:44:30.662 --> 00:44:37.066]  This technology is also going to give us treatments for people with diseases that we're really bad at treating today.
[00:44:37.086 --> 00:44:44.431]  So what you're saying, Doctor, is Pandora's box has been left open for a long time and now we've got to deal with the ramifications of it?
[00:44:44.991 --> 00:44:46.032]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:44:46.092 --> 00:44:49.274]  And remember that when they closed Pandora's box, all that was left behind was hope.
[00:44:52.047 --> 00:44:54.654]  We've got to actually look at that and say we can't despair.
[00:44:55.226 --> 00:44:56.126]  There is no hope.
[00:44:56.146 --> 00:45:02.729]  We've got to say, what is it that we can do that will best achieve a likelihood of prevention and of protection?
[00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:04.290]  This is the last question.
[00:45:04.350 --> 00:45:06.710]  I appreciate you joining us.
[00:45:07.571 --> 00:45:16.514]  A few years ago, the mousepox sequencing was released by a university in Australia.
[00:45:17.555 --> 00:45:23.537]  According to the articles I read, I'm not a geneticist or a scientist, but according to the scientists we've interviewed and according to the press reports,
[00:45:24.057 --> 00:45:33.321]  You can take that and then basically replicate that in any mammal you want, and it's got a massive death rate, much times greater than naturally occurring smallpox.
[00:45:33.901 --> 00:45:35.462]  And again, I mean, that's an example.
[00:45:35.842 --> 00:45:48.387]  Why are universities and others publishing the ingredients list for easily any medium-sized lab to produce something that kills almost everybody that comes in contact with it?
[00:45:49.027 --> 00:45:53.429]  It's an extraordinarily difficult question, this, because one of the things that people with the mouthpox experiment...
[00:45:54.228 --> 00:45:59.789]  They hadn't realised when they first started the work how significant the potential of the information they were producing was.
[00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:08.952]  When they did realise that, they talked to the editors of journals, to the people who controlled and paid for their research, to ask, should we publish this?
[00:46:08.972 --> 00:46:10.832]  And there was a great deal of thought given to that.
[00:46:11.292 --> 00:46:22.195]  And it was decided in the end to publish it, but with appropriate caveats and warnings about this, but not in quite the way that allows you, in the way you said, to immediately go into other animals.
[00:46:22.597 --> 00:46:23.938]  I think we're good to go.
[00:46:48.863 --> 00:47:17.202]  Well, you know, that's really what we're facing here, is that either we have this draconian global government that imposes a new dark age, basically freezes technological development for the general public at one level, and then, regardless, that then increases the power of the elite and these new technological spires that are already developing above our plane of technological existence.
[00:47:17.962 --> 00:47:20.263]  And, you know, that's where I see it going regardless.
[00:47:20.323 --> 00:47:34.089]  I mean, we know that most of the real developments have been kept secret already over the last 50 years, and so I have to question why then they're publishing stuff that some tin horn dictator could use to produce thousands of gallons of liquid death.
[00:47:34.869 --> 00:47:42.312]  Well, at the moment, I don't think the information and the technology is there to produce thousands of gallons, and I think it's a little bit more complex than that, although I share...
[00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:56.444]  You're concerned that the way the technology and automation is moving it will become cheaper and quicker and easier to produce powerful agents and more worrying still that the intelligent could then use the knowledge
[00:47:57.139 --> 00:47:59.882]  To manipulate different germs and different agents.
[00:48:00.042 --> 00:48:08.730]  Well, doctor, the quote I was giving you was from an article that had a former Russian biological weapons expert calling it, you know, thousands of gallons of liquid death.
[00:48:08.750 --> 00:48:09.631]  Yeah, this is Alec Beck, yeah.
[00:48:10.172 --> 00:48:10.732]  Absolutely.
[00:48:11.053 --> 00:48:19.481]  And he was recognizing that what Biopreparat did in the USSR was produce literally thousands of gallons of different agents and pounds.
[00:48:20.094 --> 00:48:24.537]  ...of powdered agents such as anthrax spores and smallpox and so on.
[00:48:24.778 --> 00:48:34.805]  I mean, one of the things we have to be very aware of as well is that there are also huge stores left over from the work that Biopreparas did, and that still has all to be destroyed.
[00:48:35.146 --> 00:48:44.573]  You know, I think BioShield, what we're building, is going to rival the size of that, and of course go past the sophistication, but bottom line, and this is the last question...
[00:48:45.530 --> 00:49:02.463]  What do you think the chances are in the next 10 years that we're going to see a major biological, serious, I mean, something that dwarfs anthrax, biological weapons release of a communicable disease here in the Western world?
[00:49:03.664 --> 00:49:08.327]  I think that it is extremely likely that we will see an attempt to do that.
[00:49:09.148 --> 00:49:14.192]  Whether it will be successful in the sense of producing enough
[00:49:14.656 --> 00:49:28.647]  People infected to pass on an agent and start an epidemic is another question because there are still difficulties in producing agents in a way that infects enough people to start your epidemic.
[00:49:28.687 --> 00:49:31.129]  But I think that it has to be a very serious worry.
[00:49:31.969 --> 00:49:41.737]  And I think that if we look 10 years beyond that, what we're really looking at then is the possibility of instead of it being germs, instead of it being viruses or bacteria that are used,
[00:49:42.168 --> 00:49:47.609]  That it will be the chemicals that control body processes that will be affected at a genetic level.
[00:49:48.830 --> 00:49:52.090]  So a chemical weapon that reprograms your body to kill itself?
[00:49:52.150 --> 00:49:54.351]  A kind of accelerated super allergic reaction?
[00:49:54.651 --> 00:50:01.693]  Yes, or some things that actually affect the way your brain produces transmitter chemicals and keeps you awake or puts you to sleep.
[00:50:01.753 --> 00:50:03.233]  You're talking about soft kills?
[00:50:03.733 --> 00:50:05.854]  We're talking about what we call bioregulators.
[00:50:06.634 --> 00:50:10.375]  So all the bioregulators which are often genetically linked anyway.
[00:50:10.839 --> 00:50:12.219]  And genetically activated.
[00:50:12.779 --> 00:50:18.860]  And I think that there's good reason to worry about those, not least because we don't have antidotes to most of those.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:23.941]  So, in many ways, you could see them as a worse biological weapon.
[00:50:24.381 --> 00:50:29.102]  You know, a lot of scientists, doctors, say sodium fluoride is just that.
[00:50:30.062 --> 00:50:30.382]  Indeed.
[00:50:30.402 --> 00:50:35.083]  I mean, there's a lot of chemicals that already have an effect on the body chemistry.
[00:50:35.443 --> 00:50:38.944]  But the sophistication of producing some of these bioregulators for the future...
[00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:47.472]  Thank you so much, Doctor, for coming on with us.
[00:50:47.492 --> 00:50:51.475]  The website is bma.org.uk.
[00:50:51.836 --> 00:50:52.957]  That's it.
[00:50:53.097 --> 00:50:54.798]  Thank you so much for coming on with us.
[00:50:54.818 --> 00:51:00.422]  All right, we'll be right back, folks, with Paul Watson and then a bunch of other news and another guest.
[00:51:00.442 --> 00:51:00.983]  So stay with us.
[00:51:02.458 --> 00:51:09.827]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[00:51:10.108 --> 00:51:14.853]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[00:51:15.074 --> 00:51:20.721]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[00:51:20.981 --> 00:51:21.701]  We're good to go.
[00:51:49.770 --> 00:51:49.990]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:52:09.043 --> 00:52:19.951]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:20.131 --> 00:52:20.511]  We're good to go.
[00:52:36.687 --> 00:52:37.207]  That's right.
[00:52:37.367 --> 00:52:44.489]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[00:52:44.789 --> 00:52:53.532]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:53.572 --> 00:52:54.032]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[00:54:06.309 --> 00:54:08.230]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:54:08.691 --> 00:54:11.673]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:11.733 --> 00:54:20.759]  You know, I was nice to that lady.
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:23.721]  And you can see the argument, see?
[00:54:24.122 --> 00:54:34.069]  We've got these weapons that can kill everybody, and so we've got to have a global government and inspections to deal with it, and that's how they sell people like Dr. Vivian...
[00:54:34.770 --> 00:54:36.792]  Nathanson on this whole New World Order.
[00:54:38.653 --> 00:54:39.434]  Well-meaning people.
[00:54:39.454 --> 00:54:45.319]  They don't understand the New World Order chiefs when you read their books or watch their speeches or read their publications.
[00:54:45.379 --> 00:54:48.822]  It's, I want to kill 80% of people as a virus.
[00:54:49.542 --> 00:54:51.744]  We need to get rid of this thoroughbred population.
[00:54:51.784 --> 00:54:53.906]  We need to forcibly sterilize them.
[00:54:55.147 --> 00:54:58.010]  We need to get cold the herd, useless feeders.
[00:54:59.759 --> 00:55:02.420]  We're the eugenics masters, social Darwinists.
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:05.921]  That's what the globalists are all about, folks.
[00:55:07.561 --> 00:55:08.721]  This is what they live for.
[00:55:08.761 --> 00:55:09.962]  This is how they operate.
[00:55:12.402 --> 00:55:16.503]  And they're, meanwhile, out there proliferating these things everywhere.
[00:55:18.424 --> 00:55:26.846]  And the plan is, get the police state in place, and the globalists are going to have controlled releases of these all over the world until they get more and more control.
[00:55:26.906 --> 00:55:28.046]  You just watch it happen.
[00:55:28.678 --> 00:55:31.460]  So being aware of it, though, is a large part of the battle.
[00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:35.302]  So don't think just because you're part of the system, you'll be protected.
[00:55:35.562 --> 00:55:47.108]  I meant to ask her, too, about these dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of biological weapons experts that have been dying in airlock accidents, car wrecks, being shot in the back of the head, drowning.
[00:55:47.688 --> 00:55:50.249]  All this has been going on, a lot of really suspicious stuff.
[00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:55.452]  Then, of course, we have biological weapons releases, and, well, it's our own government mailing the anthrax.
[00:55:56.253 --> 00:55:56.913]  Paul Watson.
[00:56:00.325 --> 00:56:01.266]  Good to have you on with us.
[00:56:01.306 --> 00:56:01.686]  Are you there?
[00:56:02.206 --> 00:56:03.087]  Yeah, good to be back.
[00:56:03.507 --> 00:56:10.711]  Yeah, sorry, I had got my time switched with that guest coming on, so I had to come back to you.
[00:56:10.731 --> 00:56:26.540]  Continuing with this article, just briefly out of the Philadelphia Daily News, they described firefighters, emergency workers, saying that they found three of the four black boxes that are actually orange and white, and then they went and interviewed more firefighters.
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:28.200]  You said, yeah, from Engine Company 261,
[00:56:30.592 --> 00:56:41.959]  They went and loaded these up and watched them drive away, and they admit that the black boxes are meant to take heats and Gs much greater than what was in the centers.
[00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:46.562]  Do you want to read some of this article, folks?
[00:56:47.682 --> 00:56:51.305]  Yeah, well, the headline is, 9-11 black box cover-up at ground zero.
[00:56:51.725 --> 00:56:52.946]  Philadelphia Daily News.
[00:56:53.982 --> 00:57:05.756]  So two men who worked extensively in the wreckage of the World Trade Center claim they helped federal agents find three of the four black boxes from the jetliners that struck the towers on 9-11, contradicting the official account.
[00:57:06.334 --> 00:57:18.501]  Both the Independent 9-11 Commission and federal authorities continue to insist that none of the four devices, the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the two planes, were ever found in the wreckage.
[00:57:18.961 --> 00:57:25.685]  But New York City firefighter Nicholas DeMarcy has written a recent book, self-published by several Ground Zero workers,
[00:57:26.167 --> 00:57:32.789]  He escorted federal agents on an all-terrain vehicle in October 2001 and helped them locate three of the four.
[00:57:33.869 --> 00:57:41.971]  His account is supported by a volunteer, Mike Bologna, whose efforts at Ground Zero have been chronicled in the New York Times and elsewhere.
[00:57:41.991 --> 00:57:52.214]  Bologna said, assisted DeMasi and the agents and that saw a device that resembled a black box in the back of the firefighter's ATV.
[00:57:53.126 --> 00:57:57.949]  Their story raises the question of whether there was some type of cover-up at Ground Zero.
[00:57:58.689 --> 00:58:09.595]  Federal aviation officials, blaming the massive devastation, have said that the World Trade Center attack seemed to be the only major jetliner crashes in which the critical devices were never located.
[00:58:10.015 --> 00:58:18.580]  A footnote to the 9-11 Commission report issued this summer slightly states, quote, the CVRs and FDRs from American and United 175 aircraft
[00:58:19.870 --> 00:58:24.695]  American 11 and United 175, the two planes that hit the Trade Center, were not found.
[00:58:25.276 --> 00:58:33.645]  And officials for the FBI, which oversaw the cleanup at Ground Zero, and the New York City Fire Department, repeated this week that the devices were never recovered.
[00:58:34.301 --> 00:58:35.302]  I think I was on it all.
[00:58:35.542 --> 00:58:38.845]  And then it goes on to the mathematics that these wouldn't be destroyed.
[00:58:39.465 --> 00:58:43.908]  So the question is, why are they then covering this up, Paul?
[00:58:43.949 --> 00:58:46.310]  And we'll answer that briefly when we get back.
[00:58:46.350 --> 00:58:50.534]  Then we've got Bev Harris from Black Box Voting joining us, and we'll take your call.
[00:58:51.674 --> 00:58:52.195]  Hello, folks.
[00:58:53.856 --> 00:58:56.999]  Big Brother.
[00:58:57.999 --> 00:58:58.600]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.290 --> 00:59:00.331]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.052 --> 00:59:02.132]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.813 --> 00:59:03.654]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.394 --> 00:59:05.315]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.955 --> 00:59:09.578]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.139 --> 00:59:14.262]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.263 --> 00:59:18.565]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:59:18.585 --> 00:59:19.506]  until 2 p.m.
[00:59:19.526 --> 00:59:21.948]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:59:21.988 --> 00:59:22.728]  We're here live.
[00:59:22.749 --> 00:59:24.310]  Thanks for joining us in the second hour.
[00:59:25.484 --> 00:59:29.767]  Coming up, Bev Harris of Black Box Voting to expose all the election fraud going on.
[00:59:30.268 --> 00:59:31.248]  Very, very important.
[00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:33.510]  Finishing up with Paul Watson.
[00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:36.692]  An article out of the Philadelphia Daily News today.
[00:59:36.712 --> 00:59:39.034]  A bunch of different workers.
[00:59:39.074 --> 00:59:40.495]  The headline is to save it.
[00:59:40.695 --> 00:59:42.897]  Now a bunch of others are in the article saying it as well.
[00:59:44.398 --> 00:59:51.483]  Firefighters, emergency workers, that they were loading the black boxes onto FBI four-wheelers and driving them out of the rubble.
[00:59:52.156 --> 00:59:56.420]  And the government says that they were all destroyed, unlike any other major plane crash.
[00:59:56.921 --> 01:00:04.629]  But it says they are built to survive the impact of 3,400 G's and a fire of 1,100 degrees Celsius, somewhat higher than estimates of the World Trade Center blaze.
[01:00:12.114 --> 01:00:15.955]  I can't recall another domestic case in which we did not recover the recorders.
[01:00:16.375 --> 01:00:22.297]  Ted's spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board told CBS News in 2002.
[01:00:23.437 --> 01:00:40.482]  So whether it's Oklahoma City or the Pentagon or any of these events, the cameras all get confiscated with the footage, the firefighter tapes all get confiscated, everybody gets told to shut up, and now with the black boxes, they're all destroyed, which of course is not true now.
[01:00:41.184 --> 01:00:57.815]  But magically a passport falls down from the sky, Paul, with one of the hijackers on it, undamaged, is picked up by authorities, but then it turns out that that guy's still alive and it was fake, and so they go, uh, it's not true, but then never retract the official story.
[01:00:58.215 --> 01:00:59.716]  Paul, this is ridiculous.
[01:01:00.557 --> 01:01:03.179]  Well, it is, and you mentioned the Pentagon.
[01:01:03.879 --> 01:01:08.222]  There's a Scientific American article which states that, um,
[01:01:09.170 --> 01:01:17.678]  Quote, although older recorders using magnetic tape were susceptible to fire damage, no solid state device has been destroyed in an accident to date.
[01:01:17.979 --> 01:01:19.660]  And that's a 2000 article.
[01:01:20.041 --> 01:01:27.228]  So it was the first time in aviation history, according to the government, that one of these solid state devices
[01:01:27.828 --> 01:01:30.069]  Black boxes have been destroyed.
[01:01:30.129 --> 01:01:32.170]  And now we have four of them being destroyed.
[01:01:32.210 --> 01:01:39.014]  Not even one survived, and the firefighters go, pure garbage, undamaged, still the paint on the outside of them.
[01:01:39.314 --> 01:01:41.495]  We loaded them onto the FBI vehicles.
[01:01:42.699 --> 01:02:00.866]  Yeah, and then I've got also on the Pentagon, Black Box's CBS story from 2002, where FBI Director Mueller said that Flight 77's data recorder provided altitude, speed, headings and other information, but the voice recorder contained nothing useful.
[01:02:01.546 --> 01:02:04.167]  So again, go back to the article which said...
[01:02:05.498 --> 01:02:11.881]  Where they did the autopsy of the victims of the Pentagon crash, where it said, no Arabs found in autopsy.
[01:02:12.621 --> 01:02:16.542]  But the bodies survived, but only one or two pieces of metal.
[01:02:17.823 --> 01:02:20.464]  Man, I tell you, these are some powerful bodies.
[01:02:22.125 --> 01:02:32.849]  Well, the point is they wouldn't, because obviously this records the last 30 seconds of voice exchange in the cockpit, and so the FBI refused to release that, saying it wasn't useful.
[01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:41.724]  It again points to the fact that these Arabs weren't even on board because none of them were found at the crash site of the Pentagon.
[01:02:42.265 --> 01:02:46.293]  And yet supposedly they found the black box within three days of the attack.
[01:02:48.096 --> 01:02:58.241]  And so it backed up, you know, that Flight 77 hit the Pentagon if they found its flight box, which is what they wanted to do in light of this other evidence which suggests something else hit the Pentagon.
[01:02:59.021 --> 01:03:02.142]  So again, with the World Trade Center, it's a similar case.
[01:03:02.182 --> 01:03:07.764]  They don't want you to know what was going on in those planes in the immediate moments before they crashed.
[01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:11.126]  They got the footage from Oklahoma City.
[01:03:11.506 --> 01:03:12.266]  People seen it.
[01:03:12.606 --> 01:03:15.328]  Scott McVeigh with other people, but they don't want us to see it.
[01:03:15.388 --> 01:03:16.028]  Wonder why.
[01:03:16.892 --> 01:03:18.293]  Same story over and over again.
[01:03:18.333 --> 01:03:24.936]  They could silence all this debate about the Pentagon by releasing the footage from all those hotels and gas stations and the Pentagon itself.
[01:03:25.756 --> 01:03:30.478]  All they release is a few frames of a flash, a white-hot explosion hitting the side of it.
[01:03:31.038 --> 01:03:36.100]  Paul Watson is the webmaster for PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:42.323]  And, Paul, we've added like three or four new videos this week to the site.
[01:03:42.403 --> 01:03:43.403]  People ought to sign up.
[01:03:43.483 --> 01:03:44.444]  Fifteen cents a day.
[01:03:46.235 --> 01:03:47.400]  I appreciate you joining us.
[01:03:47.762 --> 01:03:48.284]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:03:48.826 --> 01:03:50.292]  We'll be right back with Bev Harris.
[01:03:50.312 --> 01:03:50.754]  Stay with us.
[01:03:55.928 --> 01:04:01.413]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.853 --> 01:04:06.077]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:06.317 --> 01:04:13.364]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.744 --> 01:04:19.850]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:21.191]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:21.391 --> 01:04:21.852]  We're good to go.
[01:04:38.311 --> 01:04:41.395]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.

[01:04:42.716 --> 01:04:42.976]  Call today.
[01:04:53.607 --> 01:04:55.208]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:04:55.348 --> 01:04:59.450]  You know murky water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:02.471]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:05:02.552 --> 01:05:09.275]  The powerful black murky purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:05:09.455 --> 01:05:12.457]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:05:12.677 --> 01:05:15.058]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:05:15.178 --> 01:05:23.362]  Black murky elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as after
[01:05:23.422 --> 01:05:24.963]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:05:52.961 --> 01:05:57.303]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:05:57.483 --> 01:06:01.925]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:06:02.065 --> 01:06:06.447]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:06.487 --> 01:06:07.828]  The New World Order.
[01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:13.854]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.894 --> 01:06:20.862]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:20.962 --> 01:06:22.985]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:24.825 --> 01:06:33.848]  The new prison economy, the total information society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:33.968 --> 01:06:39.349]  If you want to understand what the new rule order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.
[01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:42.470]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:06:42.490 --> 01:06:43.050]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:43.090 --> 01:06:43.591]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:06:43.611 --> 01:06:44.891]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:06:54.634 --> 01:07:00.677]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.278 --> 01:07:04.319]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:06.541 --> 01:07:17.847]  Why, right on time for the election, Al-CIA, they're being good little servants if they are, against the Russians, against the Serbs, even against Saddam, are now helping their bosses.
[01:07:18.127 --> 01:07:21.649]  New tapes, why, authenticated by the CIA and FBI.
[01:07:21.669 --> 01:07:23.930]  They might strike us any minute.
[01:07:24.907 --> 01:07:26.629]  Oh, better give up all your freedoms.
[01:07:26.789 --> 01:07:28.531]  The attack may be coming any moment.
[01:07:29.332 --> 01:07:30.373]  I have that article here.
[01:07:30.513 --> 01:07:34.317]  FBI, CIA authenticate new Al-Qaeda terror tape.
[01:07:34.978 --> 01:07:38.802]  ABC News executives consider political implication of airing it.
[01:07:40.183 --> 01:07:46.530]  Again, firefighters and rescue workers are saying they got the black boxes from the World Trade Centers, which they said were destroyed, but...
[01:07:47.244 --> 01:07:48.245]  Don't want to discuss that.
[01:07:48.705 --> 01:07:49.765]  More on that coming up.
[01:07:49.805 --> 01:07:51.026]  Just so much news.
[01:07:51.486 --> 01:07:53.727]  Seven homeschooler dads thrown in jail.
[01:07:53.787 --> 01:07:57.309]  Families fined for refusing to send children to government institutions.
[01:07:59.290 --> 01:08:01.091]  And just so much more coming up.
[01:08:01.111 --> 01:08:09.496]  We're about to go to Bev Harris of Black Box Voting, who's been on the preeminent cutting edge of exposing this fraudulent system.
[01:08:09.556 --> 01:08:13.798]  And she's got all the new developments for us and early voting around the country.
[01:08:14.795 --> 01:08:34.550]  Before we go to Bev Harris, I do want to just take a few minutes out to remind you that I have the website prisonplanet.tv prisonplanet.tv where all 11 of my full-length feature films are posted in high bandwidth, low bandwidth, whatever connection speed you've got.
[01:08:35.631 --> 01:08:42.516]  My book, Paul Watson's book, a bunch of other great documentaries by folks who have authorized us to post their films.
[01:08:43.197 --> 01:08:51.803]  George Humphrey's new video, The Great Illusion, Eric Huffman's video, Painful Deceptions, just so much material.
[01:08:52.824 --> 01:08:57.707]  My weekly TV reports that I do locally, now you can get those nationally and internationally.
[01:08:58.608 --> 01:09:01.610]  All of the best audio interviews I do posted there daily.
[01:09:02.511 --> 01:09:06.714]  PrisonPlanet.tv, ladies and gentlemen, why would anyone...
[01:09:07.285 --> 01:09:15.028]  Not want to go and sign up for 15 cents a day at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:09:15.548 --> 01:09:23.391]  Then, of course, I've made my 11 films, and you can get them on VHS, all of them on VHS, a lot of them on DVD as well.
[01:09:23.411 --> 01:09:32.194]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, Police State, Three Total Enslavement, Matrix of Evil, Dark Secrets, Inside Bohemian Grove, and then, of course...
[01:09:33.467 --> 01:09:39.272]  My newest video is, what, 115 minutes long.
[01:09:40.213 --> 01:09:45.017]  And it is American Dictators, a little bit shorter on VHS.
[01:09:45.537 --> 01:09:49.581]  Each additional copy, after you buy one for $19.95, is $5.95.
[01:09:50.261 --> 01:09:54.125]  To buy a whole bunch and give them out as gifts to people to hopefully wake folks up.
[01:09:54.545 --> 01:09:55.706]  And it's having a great effect.
[01:09:55.786 --> 01:09:59.149]  So you can order any of the films off our Safe Secure Online Shopping Cart.
[01:10:00.024 --> 01:10:03.025]  At InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:10:03.565 --> 01:10:05.886]  Or you can simply call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:10:05.906 --> 01:10:06.286]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:10:06.306 --> 01:10:12.308]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:10:12.388 --> 01:10:13.388]  Please take action.
[01:10:26.625 --> 01:10:29.787]  People's minds are more open now than they've ever been.
[01:10:30.367 --> 01:10:33.528]  The awakening is huge, but it's not happening fast enough.
[01:10:33.568 --> 01:10:39.031]  So help us push this renaissance of understanding over the edge, the point of no return.
[01:10:39.331 --> 01:10:41.973]  The globalists are going to fail if you take action.
[01:10:43.373 --> 01:10:47.235]  Bev Harris, ladies and gentlemen, again, has been a corporate crime investigator.
[01:10:47.255 --> 01:10:48.416]  She started investigating...
[01:10:49.801 --> 01:10:50.342]  We're good to go.
[01:11:09.545 --> 01:11:12.308]  Their own engineers have quit and said the whole thing's a fraud.
[01:11:12.348 --> 01:11:18.553]  They've been caught with vice presidents running whole elections who were convicted computer crime specialists, felons.
[01:11:20.455 --> 01:11:21.416]  But that's one company.
[01:11:22.257 --> 01:11:30.984]  And then now it looks like the election fraud shaping up from 2000 is going to look tame in comparison to what's happening now.
[01:11:31.945 --> 01:11:33.967]  Bev, good to have you on with us in your busy schedule.
[01:11:34.668 --> 01:11:35.650]  Well, thanks, Alex.
[01:11:35.710 --> 01:11:36.792]  It's always nice to be here.
[01:11:36.812 --> 01:11:39.718]  And yes, we have something that's a pretty good blockbuster.
[01:11:39.758 --> 01:11:41.482]  I've broken a lot of stories on your show.
[01:11:41.963 --> 01:11:42.965]  We got another one today.
[01:11:42.985 --> 01:11:44.087]  No one has it yet.
[01:11:44.147 --> 01:11:44.969]  Well, thank you, Bev.
[01:11:45.349 --> 01:11:46.612]  Tell folks about your website.
[01:11:47.692 --> 01:11:48.533]  Oh, I would love to.
[01:11:48.593 --> 01:11:55.240]  You mean the website that just got hacked out when we posted one of the biggest stories of the year with documents and a videotape.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:12:02.787]  I would encourage people not to let someone hack out a website just to cover up information they don't want people to see.
[01:12:02.847 --> 01:12:05.770]  So please be patient and keep trying to go back there.
[01:12:06.171 --> 01:12:07.612]  It's blackboxvoting.org.
[01:12:08.877 --> 01:12:14.099]  And it seems to have experienced a slight attack ten minutes after we published some very sensitive information.
[01:12:14.199 --> 01:12:27.842]  Well, Bev, can we... Is there any sites... The answer to this, just like when they tried to make you take down Diebold documents, hundreds of universities and private sites posted it, and then they had to back off.
[01:12:27.902 --> 01:12:33.244]  I think the answer is getting packets of your video and documents out to about 20 websites...
[01:12:33.904 --> 01:12:36.725]  And they can't bring us all down without it being too obvious.
[01:12:37.465 --> 01:12:40.766]  Are there any mirror sites that have this in the interim while you're down?
[01:12:40.806 --> 01:12:42.286]  Yeah, we will be working on that.
[01:12:42.486 --> 01:12:51.589]  However, one of the other things they're working on very hard right now is to make sure that people don't know about specifically my website, blackboxcoding.org.
[01:12:52.009 --> 01:12:56.290]  And when we've done it through the mirrors, one thing that does succeed is that
[01:12:56.917 --> 01:13:02.220]  It keeps people from our website, which has got consistently the most devastating information.
[01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:09.625]  Yeah, so when they go to another site, they just get a small piece of it instead of the large spectrum analysis.
[01:13:09.705 --> 01:13:11.326]  Oh, you know, that's a great idea.
[01:13:11.346 --> 01:13:12.846]  I'm going to take your advice on that, Alex.
[01:13:12.906 --> 01:13:14.427]  I'm working on that right now, in fact.
[01:13:14.627 --> 01:13:20.491]  And what was posted early this morning, ten minutes before it decided it had to disappear,
[01:13:21.269 --> 01:13:21.830]  Is this.
[01:13:22.170 --> 01:13:23.651]  I did a public records request.
[01:13:23.671 --> 01:13:30.716]  We've been doing massive Freedom of Information Act requests all over the United States to force transparency into the secret system.
[01:13:30.976 --> 01:13:36.299]  And then somebody always screws up and accidentally releases that gem.
[01:13:36.840 --> 01:13:38.101]  Yeah, they do.
[01:13:38.501 --> 01:13:46.967]  Well, what we got was from the election held September 14th this year in King County, Washington, which happens to be my county.
[01:13:47.847 --> 01:13:50.429]  And we got a tampered audit log.
[01:13:51.536 --> 01:13:52.437]  We got tampering.
[01:13:53.438 --> 01:13:53.998]  I'm telling you.
[01:13:54.318 --> 01:13:55.980]  And we have them cold.
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:09.150]  It is either one of the biggest computer screw-ups ever, and it would involve Microsoft's program, which is a pretty, this particular program, which is a Microsoft Access program that generates automatic audit logs.
[01:14:10.211 --> 01:14:15.375]  While it may be said to have security problems, nobody said that it can't generate an audit log.
[01:14:15.595 --> 01:14:16.916]  But let me tell you what we got.
[01:14:17.475 --> 01:14:33.508]  We had a 168-page audit log spanning 120 days, and by coincidence, the Microsoft Bulletproof program used by Diebold Election Systems just happened to purge three hours during the most critical point on election night.
[01:14:34.349 --> 01:14:45.758]  So you can either look at that as an amazing coincidence where a software program melted down from Microsoft, or you can say somebody probably went in and purged those three hours, which happened to be
[01:14:47.172 --> 01:14:47.933]  And that's Seattle.
[01:14:47.993 --> 01:14:48.393]  That's Seattle.
[01:15:18.551 --> 01:15:18.931]  Of course.
[01:15:18.951 --> 01:15:21.032]  And then in addition to that, oh, it gets better.
[01:15:22.452 --> 01:15:33.195]  We figured out, it took us 45 minutes, we figured out how to get remote access to the King County Central Tabulator that counts a million votes.
[01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:42.997]  And what that means is I can sit in my living room, and if I choose to commit a felony, I can sit in my living room and dial in and control their computer.
[01:15:44.437 --> 01:15:46.558]  It doesn't actually, a ninth grader could do it.
[01:15:47.378 --> 01:15:55.123]  It requires no password and no username, but you do need to know a certain number, which they insist is kept absolutely confidential.
[01:15:55.583 --> 01:16:15.036]  Well, do you know, on my public records request, they accidentally put the secret number in some trouble reports where they were having a hard time using their modems, and people were saying, I can't make my modem work, and so they wrote down, well, try this number, and if that doesn't work, try this, and they gave away the secret code.
[01:16:15.922 --> 01:16:18.924]  And then they accidentally gave them to me in the public records request.
[01:16:20.465 --> 01:16:34.173]  I mean, what we have is a system that you can go into with remote access where they're obviously not understanding the importance of at least keeping the secret code secret, and we have a tampered audit log.
[01:16:35.414 --> 01:16:43.719]  We were right in the process of putting the videotape and a copy of the tampered audit log up when, lo and behold, our site disappeared.
[01:16:45.951 --> 01:16:46.952]  Incredible, Bev.
[01:16:47.272 --> 01:16:59.538]  And some of the other developments around the country, all over the place, missing ballots, 58,000 in Florida, voting machines crashing every time they test them or turn them on.
[01:17:00.718 --> 01:17:02.679]  Can you chronicle some of the stuff that's been happening?
[01:17:03.179 --> 01:17:03.520]  Oh, yeah.
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:08.302]  I mean, and you have ballots that are missing in sufficient quantities to flip the elections.
[01:17:09.630 --> 01:17:14.294]  I guess, you know, and I watched this 60 Minutes show last night, which was a complete pablum.
[01:17:14.374 --> 01:17:16.415]  It was like something that wasn't even new news.
[01:17:16.475 --> 01:17:17.636]  I don't understand what they were doing.
[01:17:19.337 --> 01:17:30.465]  But the situation on this, this elections official from Los Angeles County, which, by the way, has 7 million voters, and, you know, these election officials don't understand their own job.
[01:17:30.705 --> 01:17:32.707]  What she's saying is, well...
[01:17:33.354 --> 01:17:36.817]  It's a problem if you do an audit and the numbers don't match.
[01:17:37.377 --> 01:17:40.660]  So what we did was we created a machine that makes the numbers always match.
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:41.381]  She said that.
[01:17:42.041 --> 01:17:42.862]  That's a good plan.
[01:17:43.322 --> 01:17:44.643]  And I have a document.
[01:17:44.843 --> 01:17:46.705]  I mean, these people don't understand their job.
[01:17:46.745 --> 01:17:47.265]  I'm sorry.
[01:17:47.285 --> 01:17:55.572]  I have a document from here in King County where he says, well, they want us to audit, you know, 16%, but sometimes the numbers don't match.
[01:17:55.672 --> 01:17:59.075]  And if we audited 16%, we would have a complete meltdown.
[01:17:59.801 --> 01:18:05.683]  So they're admitting it doesn't work by design, so they're saying that's why you can't audit or have a trial.
[01:18:05.903 --> 01:18:11.125]  They just hide the whole thing in plain view that it is a fraud and just say, so what?
[01:18:11.585 --> 01:18:12.345]  Yes, that's right.
[01:18:12.385 --> 01:18:15.246]  They've admitted that the audits don't check out.
[01:18:15.926 --> 01:18:18.347]  Therefore, we shouldn't do them as their solution.
[01:18:18.767 --> 01:18:26.549]  And I gotta say, you know, these people that make these ridiculous statements, we gotta go back to the campaign we had going last spring, gotta be replaced.
[01:18:26.830 --> 01:18:33.972]  I mean, these are our election officials, but they don't understand a simple thing like, if the numbers don't match in the vote, you better figure out why.
[01:18:34.512 --> 01:18:40.394]  You know, they're saying, well, since they sometimes don't match, if we checked them all, it would melt us down, so let's not check.
[01:18:42.233 --> 01:18:50.707]  It's just rampant corruption, looting of the whole society, and evil right out in the open saying, what you going to do about it?
[01:18:51.188 --> 01:18:53.031]  We'll be right back with Bev Harris.
[01:18:54.068 --> 01:18:57.989]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:18:58.189 --> 01:19:10.472]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:19:10.892 --> 01:19:11.292]  The U.S.
[01:19:11.352 --> 01:19:16.934]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:19:17.314 --> 01:19:19.535]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:19:21.395 --> 01:19:21.875]  We're good to go.
[01:19:42.108 --> 01:19:42.429]  That's 1-800-686-2237
[01:19:53.817 --> 01:20:04.566]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[01:20:04.726 --> 01:20:12.333]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.

[01:20:57.314 --> 01:21:06.938]  Did you know that modern technology has devised a barcode that fits inside a tiny microchip that can be placed under the skin of dogs and children to track them everywhere they go?
[01:21:07.958 --> 01:21:17.462]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that will let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[01:21:18.516 --> 01:21:23.398]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.

[01:22:42.976 --> 01:22:43.296]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[01:23:00.914 --> 01:23:10.372]  I was talking to Beth Harris during the break, and she was talking about not only was their server hacked when they brought up this new clear election fraud material...
[01:23:11.201 --> 01:23:21.850]  But the home computer of a separate person doing separate web work for them on the same piece of information was hacked simultaneously.
[01:23:22.490 --> 01:23:31.417]  And Bev, tell folks who has put in the electronic voting machines in Seattle where this new development has come out.
[01:23:32.318 --> 01:23:34.380]  Well, that would be Diebold Election Systems.
[01:23:34.480 --> 01:23:35.260]  Are we surprised?
[01:23:36.541 --> 01:23:38.463]  They're kind of the king daddy of all this.
[01:23:39.887 --> 01:23:43.270]  Well, they seem to be showing up like a bad penny, don't they?
[01:23:43.310 --> 01:23:45.051]  Just about everywhere there's a problem.
[01:23:45.151 --> 01:23:51.536]  I know the other companies do have problems as well, but this one just doesn't look good, frankly.
[01:23:53.037 --> 01:23:56.059]  Well, you know, it's a problem like robbing a bank's a problem.
[01:23:56.079 --> 01:23:59.342]  It'd be like if somebody robbed a bank and we said, oh, he had a problem.
[01:23:59.722 --> 01:24:02.564]  I don't think it's a problem for them what's happening with their machines.
[01:24:03.184 --> 01:24:06.507]  They've been designed like this to be quite easily manipulated.
[01:24:07.415 --> 01:24:09.876]  They have definitely, this is designed in.
[01:24:10.056 --> 01:24:12.936]  The remote access is definitely designed in.
[01:24:12.976 --> 01:24:14.637]  There's no way they could not have known.
[01:24:15.117 --> 01:24:19.418]  They actually bought a piece of hardware and installed it in their system.
[01:24:19.898 --> 01:24:26.199]  With this particular piece of hardware, you can't even undo the configuration that leaves the holes wide open for remote access.
[01:24:26.420 --> 01:24:30.360]  But didn't they say like a year ago, or it was one of the companies, said, well, that was accidental.
[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:33.981]  Like, we accidentally engineer machines and add new parts and just accidentally do this.
[01:24:34.721 --> 01:24:36.822]  Was that them, or who was that that said that?
[01:24:38.753 --> 01:24:41.214]  Well, yeah, that would be Diebold.
[01:24:41.254 --> 01:24:46.098]  You know, we accidentally did this, and they also always say, oh, we fixed it, but they didn't.
[01:24:46.478 --> 01:24:51.301]  You know, and it's clear they didn't, because we get that information in Freedom of Information Requests.
[01:24:51.901 --> 01:25:07.312]  Well, if that's the case, Bev, why don't we see, like, Volkswagen's and Empire State's buildings being magically blown together in the Sahara Desert if things just accidentally fall, you know, machines accidentally are built with wireless modems hooked to them?
[01:25:08.337 --> 01:25:09.137]  Well, exactly.
[01:25:09.217 --> 01:25:14.719]  I mean, the thing that frustrates me is they can come up with the silliest rebuttals.
[01:25:14.959 --> 01:25:24.082]  For example, we showed how an audit log can be manipulated, which is exactly what we found in a manipulated audit log last night.
[01:25:24.742 --> 01:25:28.283]  But Diebold said it's a magic show and it can't happen.
[01:25:28.783 --> 01:25:30.724]  The rebuttal, that's a non-answer.
[01:25:33.305 --> 01:25:35.165]  And then they say, you can't look under the hood.
[01:25:35.205 --> 01:25:36.485]  This is proprietary.
[01:25:36.906 --> 01:25:37.826]  Just trust us.
[01:25:38.892 --> 01:25:39.413]  Oh, yeah.
[01:25:40.655 --> 01:25:42.357]  I guess you'd say faith-based voting.
[01:25:45.161 --> 01:25:47.685]  Well, I mean, it's very transparent.
[01:25:47.725 --> 01:25:54.956]  Tell the listeners some of the trials and tribulations you've gone through since you got into this.
[01:25:56.275 --> 01:26:04.177]  Yeah, you know, understand that I'm just, this was not something I set out to do or, you know, that I was going to make my mission in life and I was not an activist.
[01:26:04.717 --> 01:26:08.918]  But I saw that there was a problem and I seem to be good at asking questions.
[01:26:08.938 --> 01:26:14.799]  Since this happened, I've gotten cease and desist orders from two different voting machine companies.
[01:26:15.119 --> 01:26:17.940]  I've been interviewed by the Secret Service five times.
[01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:24.081]  And, you know, it's getting kind of ridiculous because all I'm trying to do is find out how our vote is counted.
[01:26:25.825 --> 01:26:27.706]  Well, you've been very, very effective.
[01:26:29.308 --> 01:26:32.870]  And their whole system is in trouble because of you and many others now, Bev.
[01:26:34.191 --> 01:26:36.373]  Well, gosh, I think so.
[01:26:36.493 --> 01:26:37.193]  But you know what?
[01:26:37.874 --> 01:26:38.635]  It's amazing.
[01:26:38.715 --> 01:26:41.036]  And isn't that so exciting in a way?
[01:26:41.076 --> 01:26:43.598]  Because one person can actually make things happen.
[01:26:43.698 --> 01:26:45.139]  That's something I've really learned from this.
[01:26:45.700 --> 01:26:51.424]  And speaking of one person making things happen, as soon as this blackboxvoting.org site is back up,
[01:26:51.869 --> 01:26:54.971]  I want your listeners to sign up on the cleanup crew.
[01:26:55.071 --> 01:26:58.733]  It's very easy to do, and we have some very cool things you can do.
[01:26:59.214 --> 01:27:02.416]  You don't even need to be working on your own county or state.
[01:27:02.456 --> 01:27:07.439]  You can work on Florida or wherever you want, and we've got some things that are really going to make a difference.
[01:27:07.559 --> 01:27:09.300]  So sign up in there.
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:13.563]  I don't necessarily say all our cool plans on the air because why tip our hands?
[01:27:15.405 --> 01:27:27.339]  Again, people signing up who want to help and who want to get involved and who want to go out there and basically be more eyes and ears watching and surveilling the globalists and their different activities.
[01:27:28.220 --> 01:27:31.865]  What does the Secret Service say to you when they drop by for their visits?
[01:27:33.152 --> 01:27:34.613]  Well, you know, it's funny.
[01:27:34.673 --> 01:27:43.816]  They have this concept that I'm this master, that I supervise this ring of master hackers, you know, and that's how I get all these documents.
[01:27:44.136 --> 01:27:50.058]  No, what it is, is there are some employees for these companies who are very disturbed by what they see.
[01:27:50.458 --> 01:27:53.199]  Typically, they will call me and they will say, I'm Patriot.
[01:27:53.639 --> 01:27:55.020]  Yeah, let me just say this.
[01:27:55.321 --> 01:27:57.983]  Cops, cops, how do you usually bust criminals?
[01:27:58.464 --> 01:28:00.446]  People come and drop a dime on them.
[01:28:00.786 --> 01:28:03.288]  That's how it's happening, boys and girls.
[01:28:04.169 --> 01:28:09.174]  And then you're going after a woman who's been exposing this, documenting this effectively for years.
[01:28:09.454 --> 01:28:10.835]  I hope you feel good about yourselves.
[01:28:11.876 --> 01:28:14.379]  Yeah, somebody's going to ask them at some point.
[01:28:15.160 --> 01:28:16.581]  And I want to mention something else.
[01:28:17.037 --> 01:28:24.961]  We are recommending that candidates at all levels, all the way from governor down to dog catcher, do not concede on election night.
[01:28:25.301 --> 01:28:26.142]  It makes no sense.
[01:28:26.202 --> 01:28:31.384]  There's no reason to concede the election on election night based on a projection you see on TV.
[01:28:32.365 --> 01:28:39.068]  What instead they should be doing is waiting for four or five days until they've had a chance to do at least a little bit of checking of the data.
[01:28:39.108 --> 01:28:40.208]  Tell you what, stay there.
[01:28:40.228 --> 01:28:41.369]  This is a great idea.
[01:28:41.409 --> 01:28:42.109]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.971 --> 01:28:44.931]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.351 --> 01:28:46.992]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.892 --> 01:28:50.653]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.613 --> 01:28:56.794]  I tried glucosamine for my arthritis, but it didn't help much.
[01:28:57.014 --> 01:28:59.435]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[01:28:59.695 --> 01:29:04.876]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[01:29:05.036 --> 01:29:05.736]  Well, no more.
[01:29:05.896 --> 01:29:08.857]  I'm pleased to tell you about a totally new product called Injuve.
[01:29:09.157 --> 01:29:12.278]  Rather than stopping the pain, Injuve attacks the causes of joint pain.
[01:29:12.638 --> 01:29:18.123]  Injuve replenishes what your body was born with by replacing a vital fluid your body loses as you grow older.
[01:29:18.343 --> 01:29:20.905]  It's called hyaluronic acid or HA.
[01:29:21.186 --> 01:29:28.952]  It's important to note that Injuve does not cure arthritis, but it helps reverse the aging process of our joints and reduces the pain and stiffness caused by lack of mobility.
[01:29:29.173 --> 01:29:32.375]  Injuve is one of the best lubricants and shock absorbers found in nature.
[01:29:32.595 --> 01:29:36.819]  In short, if you have joint pain or arthritis, you owe it to yourself to try Injuve.
[01:29:37.119 --> 01:29:40.102]  Injuve is all natural and comes in easy to swallow soft gels.
[01:29:40.302 --> 01:29:45.584]  Call 1-800-707-3953 and get one bottle free when you buy two.
[01:29:45.804 --> 01:29:52.127]  Remember, call 1-800-707-3953 and get your free bottle of Inju when you buy two.
[01:29:52.347 --> 01:29:52.987]  Call today.
[01:29:53.327 --> 01:29:55.288]  You've asked for them and now they're here.
[01:29:55.388 --> 01:30:06.072]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:06.452 --> 01:30:10.978]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem with a black Berkey purification element.
[01:30:11.058 --> 01:30:22.393]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:22.793 --> 01:30:23.454]  We're good to go.
[01:30:44.957 --> 01:30:45.197]  803-4438.
[01:30:45.257 --> 01:30:48.681]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:48.921 --> 01:30:49.742]  That's toll free.
[01:30:49.762 --> 01:30:49.802]  888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.361 --> 01:30:55.842]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:30:56.042 --> 01:31:03.386]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:31:03.706 --> 01:31:08.108]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:31:08.388 --> 01:31:18.213]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:31:18.973 --> 01:31:22.636]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:31:22.976 --> 01:31:25.458]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:31:25.478 --> 01:31:31.683]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:31:31.943 --> 01:31:33.484]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:31:33.764 --> 01:31:34.645]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:31:34.725 --> 01:31:37.728]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:31:37.888 --> 01:31:41.051]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:31:41.311 --> 01:31:44.414]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:31:44.514 --> 01:31:48.577]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's food supply updates.
[01:31:48.717 --> 01:31:49.718]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:31:49.738 --> 01:31:59.527]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:00.305 --> 01:32:15.689]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:17.969 --> 01:32:19.170]  Welcome back, my friends.
[01:32:19.230 --> 01:32:23.251]  I know we haven't taken any calls yet today, because we're now with our third guest.
[01:32:24.371 --> 01:32:28.432]  Because, you know, all these subjects are so important, from race-specific bioweapons...
[01:32:29.398 --> 01:32:33.581]  And we had the head of ethics and science for the British Medical Association on.
[01:32:33.601 --> 01:32:38.604]  And then we talked to Paul Watson about this Philadelphia Daily News article.
[01:32:39.965 --> 01:32:42.906]  The black boxes were not destroyed in the World Trade Centers.
[01:32:44.087 --> 01:32:47.890]  And now the firefighters and emergency workers have gone public and said this.
[01:32:48.630 --> 01:32:50.271]  Eyewitnesses highly respected.
[01:32:51.072 --> 01:32:52.713]  Everything the government's told us is a lie.
[01:32:52.733 --> 01:32:54.694]  And now we're talking to Bev Harris...
[01:32:56.018 --> 01:33:01.140]  About our election, and there's not really words to describe the level of fraud we're talking about.
[01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:09.983]  I mean, just on her website every day they probably post a dozen new articles, I mean every day, about new election fraud around the country.
[01:33:10.543 --> 01:33:16.145]  People going public, election officials admitting it, employees of these companies quitting.
[01:33:17.400 --> 01:33:21.323]  Catching the companies manipulating votes as they take place from California to New York.
[01:33:21.864 --> 01:33:24.806]  Here in Austin, Texas, you go in to vote on the hard inner civic machines.
[01:33:25.046 --> 01:33:26.007]  This has been on the newspaper.
[01:33:26.708 --> 01:33:30.510]  And you think you're voting a straight Democratic ticket, but really it's for George Bush and Cheney.
[01:33:30.530 --> 01:33:33.092]  If you don't read the fine print on the page below that.
[01:33:34.373 --> 01:33:36.115]  It's really going on.
[01:33:36.675 --> 01:33:38.897]  And when the Democrats own the machines, it's for them.
[01:33:38.917 --> 01:33:40.978]  When the Republicans own the machines, it's for their candidate.
[01:33:41.759 --> 01:33:44.761]  We have people running like Hegel who owns his own machines.
[01:33:44.801 --> 01:33:45.602]  You know, it's...
[01:33:46.377 --> 01:33:47.197]  It's ridiculous.
[01:33:48.218 --> 01:33:50.779]  And Bev Harris, you were talking about a solution to this.
[01:33:51.139 --> 01:34:01.584]  Yeah, how can they declare at 7 o'clock Central in every election who the winner is from some place called Voter News Services that since we exposed it, they've changed the name.
[01:34:03.805 --> 01:34:14.370]  They caught them in fraud back then, and then now they're going to announce again at 7, 8 o'clock at night who the projected winner is hours before polls even close in a dozen states.
[01:34:15.554 --> 01:34:25.200]  And before everything's been tabulated, before we see how much fraud went on, how many scams went on, what's your idea to kind of short circuit what they're doing?
[01:34:25.981 --> 01:34:34.506]  Well, one of the things we've got to do is get candidates to understand that to take back the system, do not concede on election night, period.
[01:34:34.546 --> 01:34:36.307]  That makes a powerful statement.
[01:34:36.963 --> 01:34:42.325]  And that makes the statement that we don't quite trust the data, so let's wait until all the facts come in.
[01:34:42.965 --> 01:34:49.708]  There's nothing wrong, nothing bad is going to happen because they don't certify the election for at least 10 days, so nothing terrible is going to happen if you don't.
[01:34:49.908 --> 01:34:52.689]  And let me give you some factual reasons why they should not concede.
[01:34:53.049 --> 01:34:59.772]  This election is going to have more provisional ballots, that's a special type of ballot, than we've ever had in the history of the United States.
[01:35:00.287 --> 01:35:03.548]  The provisionals are never used for media projections.
[01:35:03.928 --> 01:35:13.411]  A second reason, we have now uncovered three elections where we documented that the vote totals in the machine on election night were exactly transposed.
[01:35:13.871 --> 01:35:16.992]  So let's suppose your opponent has 80% and you have 20%.
[01:35:17.312 --> 01:35:21.154]  You think, well, it couldn't possibly change that much, I should concede.
[01:35:21.474 --> 01:35:22.014]  Wrong.
[01:35:22.134 --> 01:35:28.136]  We have found elections where the 80-20 all of a sudden became 20-80 when they audited the machine.
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:31.303]  Now let me stop you.
[01:35:31.664 --> 01:35:35.789]  This is the election fraud we caught them involved in in Travis County in 98.
[01:35:36.550 --> 01:35:41.476]  Their favorite trick that we've seen several times here in Austin is flipping.
[01:35:42.133 --> 01:35:46.155]  Flipping, because it's very tidy from an auditing standpoint.
[01:35:46.495 --> 01:35:48.356]  There are not as many red flags.
[01:35:48.777 --> 01:35:51.238]  Yeah, and so think about it.
[01:35:51.278 --> 01:35:58.782]  You don't say, well, as long as I'm way behind, maybe I should concede, because it could be that the results are transposed.
[01:35:59.923 --> 01:36:05.886]  They have this multi-hundred million dollar land grab thing going through that was wildly unpopular in all the polls.
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:07.620]  We're good to go.
[01:36:31.441 --> 01:36:33.002]  Most of the precincts were reporting.
[01:36:33.422 --> 01:36:34.743]  Already half the votes had been counted.
[01:36:34.763 --> 01:36:36.184]  It was like 10 o'clock at night.
[01:36:36.664 --> 01:36:41.788]  And then all of a sudden, I looked back up, because I'd been writing down notes, and it had flipped.
[01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:45.630]  And again, I was watching Channel 7.
[01:36:46.571 --> 01:36:49.933]  That's just the city channel, just a camera on the computer screen.
[01:36:50.614 --> 01:36:58.259]  And then, you know, the news never noticed that, but I was watching the actual computer and was looking up, following the numbers, covering the election, and it flipped.
[01:36:59.193 --> 01:37:04.834]  And then everybody pointed it out, and they said, well, let's just ignore this.
[01:37:05.514 --> 01:37:07.235]  A glitch, their favorite thing.
[01:37:08.375 --> 01:37:22.818]  Well, you know, the thing is, another thing that people can do on our cleanup crew, they can do it from home in their living room, understand, is to capture the screenshot of the county website when it's coming up with its interim totals.
[01:37:22.878 --> 01:37:25.358]  Because we're finding counties where the totals are going down.
[01:37:25.518 --> 01:37:27.339]  That is impossible on the voting machines.
[01:37:27.419 --> 01:37:28.199]  I've looked up...
[01:37:29.154 --> 01:37:31.376]  If the totals are going down, someone is playing with things.
[01:37:31.777 --> 01:37:34.079]  And if you capture the screenshot, you've got some evidence.
[01:37:34.159 --> 01:37:36.481]  Now, don't get the screenshot from the media source.
[01:37:36.541 --> 01:37:37.642]  Get it from the county website.
[01:37:37.682 --> 01:37:38.863]  That's what I was just saying.
[01:37:38.943 --> 01:37:39.423]  Exactly.
[01:37:39.463 --> 01:37:43.547]  Just like I was watching the county, the city have the camera on the computer.
[01:37:43.967 --> 01:37:44.508]  Exactly.
[01:37:44.528 --> 01:37:48.071]  You turn over to the news, they were reporting something completely different.
[01:37:48.735 --> 01:38:00.845]  And also, when we found one of these deteriorating totals in Arizona, we went to talk to the county elections official, and he said, well, you got that off of the CNN news site, so that must be their problem.
[01:38:01.126 --> 01:38:08.472]  So you want to rule out these excuses and get the totals right off the county's website, because I can tell you those come directly from the voting machine.
[01:38:10.405 --> 01:38:11.307]  It's unbelievable.
[01:38:12.108 --> 01:38:14.172]  It just blows me away.
[01:38:14.192 --> 01:38:17.357]  I mean, has there ever been a case where there aren't quote problems?
[01:38:17.758 --> 01:38:22.586]  I mean, Palm Beach, they turned them on two weeks ago and the whole thing just crashes.
[01:38:23.912 --> 01:38:26.373]  Well, you know, some of this is common sense.
[01:38:26.433 --> 01:38:32.734]  They're using new versions of software and machines that have never before been in use for anything with this kind of volume.
[01:38:33.154 --> 01:38:52.979]  Now, if you're a bank and you say, we're only going to beta test our ATM machines with 10% of what they're actually going to have to do on some mission-critical day, you know, the day before Christmas, well, obviously you're going to have a lot of failures if you use a brand-new software system that's never been tested at that kind of volume on the most critical day of the year.
[01:38:53.675 --> 01:38:55.135]  But that's what they're doing this fall.
[01:38:55.155 --> 01:38:59.516]  They're trying new things on a mission-critical day, things they've never tried before.
[01:39:01.036 --> 01:39:07.018]  And then they say, how dare you ask for a paper ballot to be printed off to be in a record for a hand recount later.
[01:39:07.078 --> 01:39:08.458]  You're just going to have to trust us.
[01:39:09.018 --> 01:39:12.199]  We'll just run the same computer program all over again.
[01:39:13.319 --> 01:39:17.100]  And I have to tell you, Colorado, we need to single out for special attention.
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:19.240]  We have a map on our website.
[01:39:19.622 --> 01:39:20.342]  Yeah, we're good to go.
[01:39:20.382 --> 01:39:20.963]  We're good to go.
[01:39:47.586 --> 01:39:49.087]  Talk about no transparency.
[01:39:49.667 --> 01:40:04.155]  And I would say the way that Colorado is handling it, it seems likely that there is going to be tampering with the provisional ballots because they seem to be doing particularly secretive and opaque things and no accounting for all these provisional ballots.
[01:40:04.175 --> 01:40:08.997]  Now, again, for those, we're talking about early voting or votes from troops overseas.
[01:40:09.737 --> 01:40:11.638]  No, actually, those are something new.
[01:40:12.059 --> 01:40:16.481]  Provisionals are when you go to a polling place and they say, gee, we can't find you on the voter roll.
[01:40:17.341 --> 01:40:23.889]  We'll give you a provisional, and you vote, and then we'll check later on if your vote can be counted or not.
[01:40:23.949 --> 01:40:37.425]  But the apples and oranges, semantically, what I'm saying is that all the votes that are... Most people I know went and voted early because they believe that that... because it's a paper ballot, that that somehow circumvents this, but...
[01:40:37.925 --> 01:40:41.447]  Still, it's the same people from the same system entering your data.
[01:40:41.507 --> 01:40:42.388]  Is that not correct?
[01:40:42.828 --> 01:40:43.649]  Yes, that's right.
[01:40:43.809 --> 01:40:46.030]  You know, it doesn't matter how you get your vote in there.
[01:40:46.110 --> 01:40:48.412]  It's all going to end up in one place.
[01:40:48.892 --> 01:40:57.318]  The last stop on the bus is the central tabulator, and it's going to collect together everything, including paper absentee ballots, touchscreen votes, provisionals.
[01:40:57.598 --> 01:40:58.679]  Everything goes in there.
[01:40:58.879 --> 01:41:03.562]  Bev, are you predicting that we're not going to know who the president is on November 3rd?
[01:41:05.126 --> 01:41:08.307]  Well, we're not going to know who the president is because the machines aren't auditable.
[01:41:08.327 --> 01:41:10.048]  They may want to announce who it is.
[01:41:11.449 --> 01:41:13.390]  We won't know, but we may get an announcement.
[01:41:14.750 --> 01:41:18.832]  So, now they're saying that it is bad that we announce it at 7 p.m.
[01:41:18.892 --> 01:41:19.292]  Central.
[01:41:19.592 --> 01:41:21.573]  We'll probably announce it at 9 o'clock.
[01:41:21.613 --> 01:41:23.434]  Give it a little bit more time for you.
[01:41:23.454 --> 01:41:25.655]  Well, here's the concept.
[01:41:25.755 --> 01:41:32.217]  Because the machines are so fallible, we know that they have miscounted and flipped things.
[01:41:32.758 --> 01:41:33.418]  How about...
[01:41:34.269 --> 01:41:43.872]  Again, consecrate that by saying we're not going to count this until we've at least checked a couple of audit things, like how many people voted versus how many votes showed up.
[01:41:44.132 --> 01:41:45.932]  Yeah, they've had examples of that.
[01:41:46.593 --> 01:41:47.333]  Things like that.
[01:41:47.553 --> 01:41:50.674]  Okay, you're going to use these silly things.
[01:41:51.234 --> 01:41:55.035]  Let's then add a few more checks and balances, and we'll just wait a few days.
[01:41:55.295 --> 01:41:58.916]  Well, we've had examples in Florida where there's 31,000 voters, but 37,000 people vote.
[01:42:02.541 --> 01:42:03.442]  Oh, yeah.
[01:42:03.482 --> 01:42:07.345]  Tell our county, Colorado, there were more people voted than there are adults in the county.
[01:42:09.907 --> 01:42:11.529]  You know, these things, you can't make them up.
[01:42:11.629 --> 01:42:17.794]  Arkansas, Prairie County, Arkansas, had 115% turnout on a primary where the average turnout was 20%.
[01:42:17.894 --> 01:42:19.175]  Wow, 115%.
[01:42:19.415 --> 01:42:21.457]  They really did a good job, didn't they?
[01:42:22.197 --> 01:42:23.478]  Man, my boy.
[01:42:24.719 --> 01:42:30.004]  I mean, these things do not come out, though, generally, until November 3rd through the 12th.
[01:42:31.209 --> 01:42:32.630]  So that's where we're going to see those.
[01:42:32.710 --> 01:42:40.493]  Some of them won't come out until we get Freedom of Information requests in, and that will take about a month because they like to stall in giving those.
[01:42:40.553 --> 01:42:47.176]  Well, the reason sites like BlackBoxVoting.com and also InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com Oh, InfoWars, by the way.
[01:42:47.736 --> 01:42:49.957]  Ooh, .com is a phony site, okay?
[01:42:50.438 --> 01:42:53.179]  It's run by some guy in North Carolina that likes to pretend he's me.
[01:42:54.079 --> 01:42:55.340]  .org is my site.
[01:42:55.921 --> 01:43:00.044]  Yeah, blackboxvoting.org is your website.
[01:43:00.405 --> 01:43:00.685]  Right.
[01:43:00.885 --> 01:43:07.751]  And then I was saying that on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com, we also post a lot of these articles.
[01:43:08.211 --> 01:43:16.078]  But what happens is you have election fraud news from a city here, a county there, but it never makes it out of the local paper to the national news.
[01:43:16.759 --> 01:43:19.882]  What sites like blackboxvoting.org does...
[01:43:21.083 --> 01:43:27.992]  Is you are able to take all that and show people the big picture and break through that censorship of the national media.
[01:43:28.673 --> 01:43:29.254]  Exactly.
[01:43:29.334 --> 01:43:32.798]  And what we will have going this election is great.
[01:43:32.858 --> 01:43:37.845]  It is a live self-serve reporting function where you can go and you can be in...
[01:43:39.363 --> 01:43:53.121]  One of these, you know, Podunk County, Mississippi, if there is such a thing, and you can go into your particular county and enter your particular situation so that we're going to have a complete nationwide log that you can self-serve, enter your thing, and you'll see it appear online immediately.
[01:43:53.161 --> 01:43:53.802]  It's pretty cool.
[01:43:54.668 --> 01:44:07.978]  Well, that is really exciting, blackboxvoting.org, and I hope to try to set you back up for Election Day, Bev, to track the latest developments, and then obviously in the days after the election you're doing just a fabulous job.
[01:44:08.478 --> 01:44:10.360]  And folks can get your book, can't they?
[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:11.420]  They can.
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:15.964]  Amazon.com is the place to get it, or they can go to blackboxvoting.org and click the book cover.
[01:44:16.664 --> 01:44:18.225]  And tell folks the name of the book?
[01:44:18.786 --> 01:44:21.127]  Black Box Voting, Ballot Tampering in the 21st Century.
[01:44:22.799 --> 01:44:23.399]  Absolutely.
[01:44:23.439 --> 01:44:27.482]  Well, Bev, I really appreciate your fine work and taking time out, and I'll talk to you soon.
[01:44:28.002 --> 01:44:28.602]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:44:29.183 --> 01:44:34.886]  There goes Bev Harris, ladies and gentlemen, and it's just all out of control.
[01:44:34.966 --> 01:44:36.006]  I mean, what do you say?
[01:44:36.727 --> 01:44:42.790]  They're just flaunting record corruption and arrogance in our face.
[01:44:45.952 --> 01:44:46.972]  It's just out of control.
[01:44:46.992 --> 01:44:49.354]  I mean, you heard her talk about...
[01:44:50.837 --> 01:44:57.121]  Major cities, Los Angeles, they say, well, when we audit, we show massive problems, so we just won't do audits anymore.
[01:44:59.342 --> 01:45:00.743]  And Bev has it all on her site.
[01:45:00.783 --> 01:45:06.386]  She's very neurotic about sticking to the facts, so if she's saying it, it's documented, and she's got those cases posted.
[01:45:08.087 --> 01:45:10.448]  And it's the ridiculous comebacks they come back with.
[01:45:11.169 --> 01:45:16.592]  And if you don't like it, they go, hey, we have thousands of people working for us that wear black ski masks and have machine guns.
[01:45:17.523 --> 01:45:18.564]  We have armored vehicles.
[01:45:18.604 --> 01:45:20.565]  We have lots of prisons for you and your family.
[01:45:20.946 --> 01:45:21.466]  Shut up.
[01:45:22.127 --> 01:45:23.728]  Don't ask for a paper ballot.
[01:45:23.908 --> 01:45:25.169]  Keep your mouth shut!
[01:45:26.502 --> 01:45:27.523]  Do you understand us?
[01:45:27.543 --> 01:45:29.424]  We're building lots of presents for you slaves.
[01:45:29.745 --> 01:45:30.986]  Learn who runs things.
[01:45:31.006 --> 01:45:32.007]  Do you understand?
[01:45:32.467 --> 01:45:38.832]  We're going to send the troops overseas and they're going to breathe a piece of uranium and we're not going to give them treatment when they come back here and die.
[01:45:39.373 --> 01:45:43.376]  We don't care how many newspapers and how many reports and how many scientists show they're dying.
[01:45:43.536 --> 01:45:44.537]  We're not going to treat them.
[01:45:44.797 --> 01:45:46.058]  That's how you support the troops.
[01:45:46.418 --> 01:45:47.299]  So shut your mouth.
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:50.502]  And we're going to give you lots of vaccines and we're going to make it the law.
[01:45:50.522 --> 01:45:52.303]  And we're going to put lots of mercury in it.
[01:45:52.323 --> 01:45:54.265]  And we're going to tell you it's nutritious for you.
[01:45:55.171 --> 01:45:56.852]  And we're going to ship the narcotics in.
[01:45:57.052 --> 01:46:01.515]  And then when your kids use it, we're going to put them in the private prisons that we, the drug dealers, own.
[01:46:01.835 --> 01:46:02.995]  Because we're the mafia.
[01:46:03.256 --> 01:46:04.696]  And we've got all this figured out.
[01:46:04.897 --> 01:46:07.538]  And so you learn how to take it, scum.
[01:46:07.778 --> 01:46:10.120]  You learn how to be our slaves.
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:11.740]  You understand us?
[01:46:12.101 --> 01:46:15.282]  We're gearing up to smash you and really make you slaves.
[01:46:15.443 --> 01:46:16.803]  You think you're slaves now?
[01:46:17.023 --> 01:46:17.724]  Just wait.
[01:46:18.911 --> 01:46:20.772]  Now, that's the spirit of the New World Order, folks.
[01:46:21.212 --> 01:46:22.373]  You can just deny it exists.
[01:46:22.393 --> 01:46:23.453]  You can decide to fight it.
[01:46:23.854 --> 01:46:26.855]  We've got the power to stop these people, and we're going to stop them.
[01:46:26.995 --> 01:46:28.256]  We're never going to surrender.
[01:46:29.036 --> 01:46:30.637]  Dennis in Michigan, thanks for holding.
[01:46:31.157 --> 01:46:31.798]  You're on the air.
[01:46:31.878 --> 01:46:32.418]  Go ahead.
[01:46:32.598 --> 01:46:32.998]  Yes, sir.
[01:46:33.058 --> 01:46:34.559]  Thank you very much for having me on.
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:38.521]  I'm a candidate for the 6th District in Michigan for Congress.
[01:46:39.462 --> 01:46:39.962]  Great.
[01:46:40.803 --> 01:46:41.143]  Thank you.
[01:46:41.783 --> 01:46:47.306]  One of the things I wanted to point out is the libertarians are talking, and I went to several of their meetings and saw their book.
[01:46:47.941 --> 01:46:49.582]  They have no God, basically.
[01:46:49.622 --> 01:46:50.722]  They've eliminated God.
[01:46:50.742 --> 01:47:03.606]  And I have maybe a dozen constitutions, and most of them have gotten rid of the... Well, I'm voting for Michael Perutka, but I don't want to bash the libertarians.
[01:47:03.626 --> 01:47:14.069]  They have a very wide spectrum of libertarian members, and certainly you can find what you'd call kind of liberal libertarians, or you can find extremely conservative libertarians.
[01:47:14.705 --> 01:47:19.007]  I'm talking about the book that's put out by the party and all the party information.
[01:47:19.807 --> 01:47:20.488]  I'm with the U.S.
[01:47:20.548 --> 01:47:24.050]  Taxpayers Party, and nationally that's with Michael Peruca.
[01:47:24.090 --> 01:47:25.230]  Yeah, I know that.
[01:47:26.070 --> 01:47:32.714]  So one of my main concerns is 2 Chronicles 7.14.
[01:47:32.974 --> 01:47:34.855]  It's an if-then statement.
[01:47:35.395 --> 01:47:37.656]  We have to humble ourselves and come back to God.
[01:47:38.356 --> 01:47:38.676]  We do.
[01:47:38.736 --> 01:47:43.899]  We've become a degenerate, arrogant, decadent, soft,
[01:47:44.714 --> 01:47:52.577]  A babyish population that have now been enslaved and it's just going to get worse until we stand up and start saying, no way, we're not going along with this.
[01:47:53.077 --> 01:47:59.359]  And if we have a King James Bible, we will find governments as a spiritual gift in 1 Corinthians 12.28.
[01:48:00.560 --> 01:48:06.082]  And then he's talking about worshipping the Creator versus the creation in Romans 1.25.
[01:48:08.614 --> 01:48:17.817]  One pastor had an idea for Project Listen where we just listen to the Bible and these traffic jams and everything else and learn the roots of our freedom.
[01:48:18.418 --> 01:48:26.841]  Well, I personally own the Old and New Testament on tape and listen to the Bible, I think, twice now in all these long road trips I go on over the years.
[01:48:27.201 --> 01:48:28.901]  I think I'll pull that out of storage.
[01:48:28.921 --> 01:48:29.822]  I think it's in my attic.
[01:48:30.262 --> 01:48:30.962]  Listen to it again.
[01:48:30.982 --> 01:48:31.662]  Thanks for the call.
[01:48:32.683 --> 01:48:34.683]  Let's talk to Robert in Colorado.
[01:48:34.743 --> 01:48:35.484]  Robert, go ahead.
[01:48:35.524 --> 01:48:36.444]  Welcome to the Airwaves.
[01:48:39.875 --> 01:48:40.796]  Well, I'm doing good, Robert.
[01:48:40.836 --> 01:48:41.237]  How are you?
[01:48:43.279 --> 01:48:45.482]  Let's talk to... Who's up next here?
[01:48:47.304 --> 01:48:48.005]  Mike in Illinois.
[01:48:48.025 --> 01:48:48.586]  You're on the air.
[01:48:48.626 --> 01:48:49.066]  Go ahead.
[01:48:49.087 --> 01:48:49.667]  Hey, Alex.
[01:48:49.707 --> 01:48:50.108]  How you doing?
[01:48:50.368 --> 01:48:50.608]  Good.
[01:48:51.089 --> 01:48:52.170]  Listen, I want to just say...
[01:48:53.024 --> 01:48:54.526]  You know, you had your guest on there about voting.
[01:48:54.666 --> 01:49:11.382]  They announced on ABC News two days ago that they did one of those stupid polls, as they always do, and they said the error margin is 3%, but now they're saying, well, it's going to be bigger because they're having this unusually large turnout, unlike in the 2000 election.
[01:49:11.723 --> 01:49:15.567]  Now they're saying all these people are coming out of the woodwork and they're going to vote.
[01:49:17.274 --> 01:49:26.878]  Yeah, we knew this was going to happen, and that's why, again, folks, John Kerry will really win the election, but it will be given to George W. Bush.
[01:49:27.598 --> 01:49:35.541]  Yeah, isn't it ironic, too, Alex, that they said again, I read the newspaper, Chicago Sun-Times, the other day, that it's so close to calling Florida again.
[01:49:35.561 --> 01:49:37.782]  Hey, I tell you what, stay there, we'll talk about it.
[01:49:38.362 --> 01:49:42.784]  And don't worry, neocons, you're going to get Bush and Kerry, I didn't say would save us.
[01:49:43.436 --> 01:49:46.017]  So don't get all upset when I commit blasphemy.
[01:49:46.297 --> 01:49:48.077]  Don't worry, you'll get your devil worshipper.
[01:49:48.497 --> 01:49:50.038]  You're going to get your god.
[01:49:50.058 --> 01:49:55.199]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.379 --> 01:49:58.480]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:02.520]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.561 --> 01:50:06.802]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:07.142 --> 01:50:10.922]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.042 --> 01:50:12.843]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:15.725 --> 01:50:21.109]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.269 --> 01:50:24.311]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[01:50:24.491 --> 01:50:27.353]  They are being led into the Sandpoint brig.
[01:50:27.833 --> 01:50:33.958]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.498 --> 01:50:36.599]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:50:53.175 --> 01:50:57.079]  Black Berkey replacement elements are ideal for use in any gravity filter.
[01:50:57.279 --> 01:51:02.744]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[01:51:03.024 --> 01:51:13.394]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[01:51:13.554 --> 01:51:17.898]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:51:18.078 --> 01:51:26.426]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[01:51:26.706 --> 01:51:33.012]  They reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[01:51:33.172 --> 01:51:33.412]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:53:02.151 --> 01:53:04.451]  Let me boil this down, okay?
[01:53:05.071 --> 01:53:07.012]  I mean, I've spent my life studying this.
[01:53:08.192 --> 01:53:10.333]  I want to defend the border, the Second Amendment.
[01:53:10.753 --> 01:53:14.634]  I want to defend our right to practice our religions freely in this country.
[01:53:14.794 --> 01:53:15.574]  I am a Christian.
[01:53:16.474 --> 01:53:17.955]  But call me a paleo-Christian.
[01:53:18.095 --> 01:53:23.756]  I mean, I don't believe in the Christianity that George Bush and the neocons pushed.
[01:53:23.776 --> 01:53:25.177]  That's not my God.
[01:53:26.477 --> 01:53:26.597]  And...
[01:53:27.623 --> 01:53:32.988]  People can buy the great illusion if they want to and love the National ID card and praise the Patriot Act.
[01:53:33.508 --> 01:53:36.651]  I'll tell you right now, folks, if I didn't love the devil, I don't know what is.
[01:53:36.911 --> 01:53:48.742]  If your guts, if your inner compass doesn't tell you, I mean, if you can't just feel God's rage over the things that are happening, there's something wrong with you, folks.
[01:53:50.370 --> 01:53:57.557]  And these people, they email me, not a lot, but some, well, you're not enthusiastically supporting George Bush, Alex, and I've been listening to you for years, and I'm mad at you.
[01:53:58.098 --> 01:54:00.020]  And what is this about Kerry being better?
[01:54:00.540 --> 01:54:02.422]  Folks, George Bush is going to be elected.
[01:54:03.703 --> 01:54:04.104]  Okay?
[01:54:04.144 --> 01:54:05.165]  I've been saying that for years.
[01:54:05.185 --> 01:54:11.211]  You almost swayed me to Kerry that the elite wanted him, but I think there may be a fissure in the New World Order.
[01:54:12.858 --> 01:54:20.143]  Kerry's better because conservatives would wake up and Bill Clinton would never get confirmed to the Secretary General ship.
[01:54:20.183 --> 01:54:21.383]  There'd be a fight in Congress.
[01:54:23.185 --> 01:54:24.626]  None of this would ever happen.
[01:54:24.646 --> 01:54:26.587]  They'd never get away with blanket amnesty.
[01:54:26.867 --> 01:54:28.969]  They'd never get away with signing back on to UNESCO.
[01:54:29.269 --> 01:54:30.810]  They'd never get away with any of it.
[01:54:31.791 --> 01:54:35.493]  But George Bush can carry the ball for the New World Order, and he has.
[01:54:36.594 --> 01:54:38.115]  And so get all emotional about it.
[01:54:38.175 --> 01:54:39.436]  Don't worry, you're going to get him.
[01:54:40.763 --> 01:54:49.825]  And don't worry, it doesn't matter, because he's a puppet, just like his cousin Carrie, who I cannot stand, who I do not want to look at, either one of them.
[01:54:50.205 --> 01:54:54.366]  By the way, we've got that arrogant psychopath, George Bush, on my website right now.
[01:54:54.707 --> 01:54:56.727]  You want to see what he did when he was running for governor?
[01:54:56.967 --> 01:55:08.410]  Go look at this spoiled brat frat boy, throw a fit, grab his head and have a convulsion and look psychopathic, and then start flipping his employees off and yelling at him.
[01:55:09.119 --> 01:55:13.881]  You just go ahead and you go look at your little angel, okay?
[01:55:13.901 --> 01:55:20.325]  I mean, if you can't see just the seething, demonic nature of George Bush, you're blind.
[01:55:20.565 --> 01:55:22.046]  Put the sunglasses on.
[01:55:22.386 --> 01:55:26.628]  You don't have the discernment of an earthworm if you can't see it.
[01:55:27.088 --> 01:55:29.569]  The evil dripping off of John Kerry.
[01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:32.371]  The evil dripping off of George Bush.
[01:55:33.300 --> 01:55:38.223]  If you can't see what they are looking at them... Oh, Mike in Illinois, go ahead and finish up.
[01:55:38.263 --> 01:55:39.303]  I'm sorry for ranting.
[01:55:39.483 --> 01:55:40.204]  No, that's okay, Alex.
[01:55:40.304 --> 01:55:40.644]  I love it.
[01:55:41.604 --> 01:55:44.266]  I just want to ask you one question here.
[01:55:45.346 --> 01:55:50.369]  Now, Alex, we know that the Bible says that a wolf can come in sheep's clothing.
[01:55:50.429 --> 01:55:55.631]  And Alex, I just want to tell you, I belong to a Baptist church, a small congregation of about 80 people.
[01:55:55.651 --> 01:55:56.692]  I've showed your film there.
[01:55:57.983 --> 01:55:59.424]  You know, a lot of people accept it.
[01:55:59.444 --> 01:56:01.325]  There's a lot of speculative people there, too.
[01:56:01.786 --> 01:56:10.331]  You know, the thing is, Alex, my pastor gets up there, and he just, you know, it doesn't rant and rave, he's actually praising George Bush, saying he's our commander-in-chief, he's a Christian, he's this, he's that.
[01:56:10.991 --> 01:56:15.394]  Alex, he is not, I mean, when you say, if that's a Christian, he's not a Christian, Alex.
[01:56:15.434 --> 01:56:18.776]  In my opinion, he is absolutely, his God is Satan.
[01:56:19.537 --> 01:56:25.919]  And I can say that with a clear mind, because I really believe, Alex, that that man, I mean, he is evil.
[01:56:25.959 --> 01:56:28.459]  He's a skull and bone member, so is Kerry.
[01:56:29.379 --> 01:56:32.620]  We know that for a fact, and we know that he's evil in everything he does.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:33.900]  Sure, they worship Moloch.
[01:56:34.521 --> 01:56:34.841]  Absolutely.
[01:56:34.861 --> 01:56:36.701]  They bust in male prostitutes.
[01:56:38.021 --> 01:56:40.502]  Yeah, and it's disticting, Alex.
[01:56:40.662 --> 01:56:44.283]  I mean, look, folks, if I was in my backyard, worshiping Moloch,
[01:56:45.003 --> 01:56:50.426]  And then I was a local preacher, and there was a video out, and it was admitted that I went there, and I was part of this.
[01:56:51.246 --> 01:56:53.287]  Folks, the congregation would leave in ten seconds.
[01:56:54.288 --> 01:56:55.348]  I don't know nowadays, though.
[01:56:55.368 --> 01:56:57.549]  Maybe they'd say, well, this is good.
[01:56:57.609 --> 01:56:58.690]  Moloch is very loving.
[01:56:59.710 --> 01:57:01.131]  The Bible doesn't say that.
[01:57:02.975 --> 01:57:06.136]  I have to argue with people about Moloch not being good, okay?
[01:57:06.276 --> 01:57:07.016]  It's unbelievable.
[01:57:07.036 --> 01:57:08.857]  There's been voter corruption going on for a long time.
[01:57:09.017 --> 01:57:14.618]  Do you ever talk about the 1960 election when Kennedy stole... Yeah, you live in the capital of election fraud.
[01:57:14.958 --> 01:57:15.598]  Absolutely, Alex.
[01:57:15.618 --> 01:57:16.899]  The daily machine, yeah.
[01:57:17.719 --> 01:57:19.099]  That's been going on for a long time.
[01:57:20.320 --> 01:57:24.981]  Look, I mean, folks, what matters is that county race.
[01:57:26.461 --> 01:57:28.722]  What matters is that city race, that state race.
[01:57:30.023 --> 01:57:30.764]  That's what matters.
[01:57:30.804 --> 01:57:32.826]  You can just forget the presidential election.
[01:57:33.927 --> 01:57:35.048]  Pray for this country, though.
[01:57:35.068 --> 01:57:36.910]  Thanks for the call.
[01:57:37.491 --> 01:57:38.672]  We'll be back with the third hour.
[01:57:38.692 --> 01:57:40.053]  A ton of news, more of your calls.
[01:57:40.093 --> 01:57:41.635]  Please stay with us.
[01:57:41.675 --> 01:57:42.415]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.437 --> 01:57:52.478]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.219 --> 01:57:54.300]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.961 --> 01:57:55.802]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.543 --> 01:57:57.504]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.524 --> 01:58:01.888]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.309 --> 01:58:06.433]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.875 --> 01:58:08.576]  All right, folks.
[01:58:08.696 --> 01:58:09.356]  Third hour.
[01:58:09.577 --> 01:58:12.180]  We blast out on the AM and FM dial from L.A.
[01:58:12.240 --> 01:58:13.281]  to Rhode Island.
[01:58:14.306 --> 01:58:23.872]  Channel cast on the internet at infowars.com and prisonpundit.tv and on global shortwave during the day and at night from 9 to midnight and of course 11 to 2 during the day.
[01:58:24.513 --> 01:58:28.255]  And attention WWCR, our wonderful shortwave provider.
[01:58:29.176 --> 01:58:35.079]  Two weeks ago they sent me a fax telling me of the new frequency during the day, 9.985.
[01:58:36.100 --> 01:58:38.822]  More than two weeks ago and I just forgot about it and
[01:58:39.935 --> 01:58:45.199]  Do not plug it in the first few hours of the show the last few days, where we have a lot of listeners, and just keep forgetting.
[01:58:46.440 --> 01:58:53.525]  And so I'm going to ask WWCR tomorrow, and for the rest of the day, if you can, just drop it in over me talking.
[01:58:54.986 --> 01:59:01.611]  Now that I'm thinking about it, and we need to get the word out to everybody, because we'll get like a thousand phone calls or so on Monday, people going, where is the show?
[01:59:01.631 --> 01:59:03.633]  9.985, starting Monday, 9.985.
[01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:15.493]  And if WWCR tomorrow, guys, if every ten minutes you just want to drop it in over me, or drop it in over whatever, please do.
[01:59:15.513 --> 01:59:21.015]  I know you've been playing announcements, but I don't think it's enough because I haven't been doing it.
[01:59:21.876 --> 01:59:23.757]  So you can take up the slack because I'm bad.
[01:59:24.777 --> 01:59:25.277]  It's a favor.
[01:59:25.317 --> 01:59:26.017]  Will you please do it?
[01:59:26.038 --> 01:59:26.017]  9.985.
[01:59:26.798 --> 01:59:31.620]  And for all the listeners, call all the other shows on this network and other networks.
[01:59:32.450 --> 01:59:39.433]  I rarely ask for favors and tell them next week, 11 to 2, new time, because it was such a key time next week, 9.985.
[01:59:40.113 --> 01:59:44.675]  And WWCR has millions of listeners conservatively.
[01:59:44.735 --> 01:59:49.056]  It is the preeminent, oldest, most established private tour wave outlet.
[01:59:49.076 --> 01:59:50.057]  They do a great job.
[01:59:50.437 --> 01:59:51.417]  They're switching frequencies.
[01:59:51.457 --> 01:59:53.698]  I haven't called them to find out why, but I'm sure it's a good reason.
[01:59:53.718 --> 01:59:53.698]  9.985, 9.985, 9.985.
[01:59:59.847 --> 02:00:05.109]  But again, most people tune in for 10-20 minutes, and we're going to miss that, and we're going to pay the piper on Monday.
[02:00:05.129 --> 02:00:09.490]  We're going to take a lot of calls, get into a ton of vital news this hour.
[02:00:09.890 --> 02:00:19.073]  More on firefighters and emergency workers, saying, hey, we found three of the four black boxes from 9-11 at the World Trade Center, and you're covering it up.
[02:00:19.154 --> 02:00:20.674]  This is out of the Philadelphia Daily News.
[02:00:21.994 --> 02:00:26.436]  In fact, I want to tell my producer right now, let's get the writer William Bunch on if we can tomorrow.
[02:00:27.102 --> 02:00:28.043]  We're going to talk about that.
[02:00:28.663 --> 02:00:30.525]  Homeschoolers being arrested.
[02:00:30.565 --> 02:00:32.186]  Just a bunch of police state news.
[02:00:32.907 --> 02:00:33.928]  A large stack of it.
[02:00:33.968 --> 02:00:35.229]  But let's get to more of these calls.
[02:00:36.110 --> 02:00:39.072]  Let's go ahead and talk to George in Illinois.
[02:00:39.533 --> 02:00:40.633]  George, thanks for holding.
[02:00:40.673 --> 02:00:41.814]  You're on the air.
[02:00:42.495 --> 02:00:44.297]  Alex, I love your show.
[02:00:44.577 --> 02:00:45.778]  I have almost all your tapes.
[02:00:46.218 --> 02:00:49.681]  And I was approached by my priest, the congregation.
[02:00:49.721 --> 02:00:52.664]  He said he wanted to see the 9-11 tape.
[02:00:52.744 --> 02:00:53.444]  That's good news.
[02:00:54.045 --> 02:00:55.286]  I have a comment and a question.
[02:00:55.856 --> 02:00:56.916]  First, to the comment.
[02:00:57.397 --> 02:01:01.198]  I know a lady, very, very good-looking, fine lady.
[02:01:02.198 --> 02:01:06.340]  And we have the two African-American candidates running against each other.
[02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:08.481]  One is Alan Keyes, the other one is Obama.
[02:01:09.081 --> 02:01:14.123]  And she made a sign on her car on the back saying, do not vote for the abomination.
[02:01:14.143 --> 02:01:16.664]  In other words, Obama abomination.
[02:01:17.304 --> 02:01:18.925]  She parked in a public parking lot.
[02:01:18.945 --> 02:01:20.846]  There was no car next to her car.
[02:01:21.866 --> 02:01:24.607]  The squad car pulled up, harassed her,
[02:01:25.134 --> 02:01:30.678]  Went through all the hoops, gave her a hard time, and wrote her up.
[02:01:31.158 --> 02:01:32.159]  And she was appalled.
[02:01:32.179 --> 02:01:33.119]  She didn't know what was going on.
[02:01:33.139 --> 02:01:34.480]  She didn't do anything against the law.
[02:01:34.881 --> 02:01:42.426]  Yeah, Alan Keyes is clearly better than the other candidate, and so the joke is he's an abomination, Obama.
[02:01:42.946 --> 02:01:45.888]  And you're telling me that the police harassed her for this?
[02:01:46.048 --> 02:01:48.070]  Yes, and she said she didn't park illegally.
[02:01:48.090 --> 02:01:50.151]  There were no cars next to her in the public parking lot.
[02:01:50.771 --> 02:01:54.294]  The squad car came up to her, wrote her up,
[02:01:55.149 --> 02:02:00.753]  Asked her questions and went through all the hoops with insurance and all this stuff.
[02:02:01.074 --> 02:02:02.655]  Wrote her up for what?
[02:02:03.135 --> 02:02:03.956]  For having that time.
[02:02:05.317 --> 02:02:06.838]  Oh, that's a huge news story.
[02:02:07.118 --> 02:02:08.860]  You've got to get her in contact with me.
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:11.121]  She's got to get in contact with the Associated Press.
[02:02:11.542 --> 02:02:14.264]  World Net Daily would be all over that.
[02:02:14.864 --> 02:02:15.925]  You've got to email them.
[02:02:16.385 --> 02:02:18.987]  Can you call her and get her to call into the show right now?
[02:02:20.228 --> 02:02:20.829]  I could try.
[02:02:20.849 --> 02:02:22.270]  Well, hold on.
[02:02:22.310 --> 02:02:23.771]  What did the cop write her up for?
[02:02:25.276 --> 02:02:26.337]  She didn't even know.
[02:02:26.357 --> 02:02:27.919]  There was no reason.
[02:02:28.099 --> 02:02:29.300]  Nothing was illegal what she did.
[02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:31.582]  But he wrote her up for the sign specifically?
[02:02:32.163 --> 02:02:34.746]  Yeah, he basically checked her out.
[02:02:36.627 --> 02:02:37.528]  I'll tell you what, stay there.
[02:02:37.568 --> 02:02:38.549]  Let's get to the bottom of this.
[02:02:38.569 --> 02:02:42.353]  I'm not quite sure what your... the particulars.
[02:02:42.473 --> 02:02:43.214]  I need those.
[02:02:43.254 --> 02:02:43.835]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:47.992 --> 02:02:53.474]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:53.914 --> 02:02:58.135]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:58.375 --> 02:03:05.417]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.777 --> 02:03:11.899]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:12.039 --> 02:03:13.259]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.359 --> 02:03:15.642]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:03:30.379 --> 02:03:33.503]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[02:03:33.523 --> 02:03:33.583]  866-885-6625.
[02:03:33.603 --> 02:03:33.643]  866-885-6625.
[02:03:33.863 --> 02:03:34.804]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:03:34.824 --> 02:03:35.024]  Call today.
[02:03:45.347 --> 02:03:46.928]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:03:47.328 --> 02:03:53.052]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[02:03:53.313 --> 02:03:58.456]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[02:03:58.796 --> 02:04:01.078]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements are
[02:04:01.138 --> 02:04:01.678]  We're good to go.
[02:04:23.047 --> 02:04:29.034]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[02:04:29.294 --> 02:04:35.521]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:04:35.561 --> 02:04:36.503]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[02:04:36.543 --> 02:04:37.824]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.129 --> 02:04:49.474]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:49.654 --> 02:04:54.080]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:54.240 --> 02:04:58.625]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:58.665 --> 02:04:59.987]  The New World Order.
[02:05:00.783 --> 02:05:01.964]  We're good to go.
[02:05:28.983 --> 02:05:29.343]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:05:29.403 --> 02:05:30.744]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:05:30.784 --> 02:05:32.825]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:32.905 --> 02:05:34.546]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.789 --> 02:05:54.809]  Alright, callers.
[02:05:55.309 --> 02:05:56.990]  Calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:05:57.010 --> 02:06:04.012]  1-800-259-9231 Then I'll get into articles well, like this one.
[02:06:04.052 --> 02:06:06.432]  Seven homeschoolers, dads thrown in jail.
[02:06:06.812 --> 02:06:09.913]  Families fined for refusing to send children to government institutions.
[02:06:10.553 --> 02:06:14.494]  Another article here out of the Daily Northwestern newspaper, Skull and Bones Showdown.
[02:06:15.194 --> 02:06:21.996]  Another article here about a federal judge says you cannot give these experimental vaccines to the troops, but the
[02:06:22.523 --> 02:06:23.464]  The Pentagon doesn't care.
[02:06:23.524 --> 02:06:27.086]  They're trying to continue this extremely dangerous practice.
[02:06:27.647 --> 02:06:37.534]  We're about to be talking to Alex Vitale, and he is a sociology professor at Brooklyn College who studies political behavior and political protest.
[02:06:37.954 --> 02:06:42.778]  He argues that the type of draconian abuse of protesters across the political spectrum
[02:06:43.651 --> 02:06:46.012]  Right now, it hasn't been seen since the Vietnam era.
[02:06:46.492 --> 02:06:51.274]  I'd say it's even worse than it was back then because of the widespread nature of it.
[02:06:51.755 --> 02:07:08.842]  But nicely meshing with this subject, George just called in from Illinois where one of his friends from his church had a sign for Alan Keyes for his election and kind of a pun on the guy he's running against, his opponent.
[02:07:09.423 --> 02:07:10.763]  Okay, maybe I should retract.
[02:07:10.783 --> 02:07:12.504]  I don't know whether she was physically written up.
[02:07:38.422 --> 02:07:48.750]  But she was harassed, and he went through all the hoops, checking her totally out, what she basically... Okay, because earlier you said he wrote her up, and then you said she... You know what?
[02:07:49.351 --> 02:07:53.514]  Sir, sir, sir, did the cop specifically say something about her sign?
[02:07:55.256 --> 02:07:58.879]  She was very, very offended because she didn't do anything against the law.
[02:07:58.919 --> 02:08:00.400]  So he didn't even say anything about her sign?
[02:08:01.244 --> 02:08:03.425]  I have to ask you about that.
[02:08:03.445 --> 02:08:06.786]  See, sir, you need to be clear on that, because you called in and said she was written up and all that.
[02:08:06.926 --> 02:08:07.706]  I believe she was.
[02:08:07.926 --> 02:08:09.567]  Okay, well then, it probably was.
[02:08:09.587 --> 02:08:12.908]  I mean, we've got people being arrested for wearing Peace on Earth t-shirts.
[02:08:12.948 --> 02:08:21.150]  We've got people being thrown out of Bush protests or demonstrations because they have a shirt that says, Keep Civil Liberties.
[02:08:21.210 --> 02:08:24.171]  I mean, I don't think that the story isn't true.
[02:08:24.251 --> 02:08:25.091]  I just need specifics.
[02:08:25.311 --> 02:08:30.133]  I'm going to have her call you, and the thing is, she was totally with the law.
[02:08:31.681 --> 02:08:31.921]  Okay.
[02:08:31.941 --> 02:08:32.101]  Okay.
[02:08:53.277 --> 02:08:54.077]  The Democratic thing.
[02:08:54.378 --> 02:08:59.620]  But besides being Democratic or Republican, I mean, I know for the longest time that we have a one-party system.
[02:09:00.081 --> 02:09:01.821]  So why do we get excited?
[02:09:01.881 --> 02:09:03.862]  I mean, what's going to happen is going to happen anyway.
[02:09:03.902 --> 02:09:10.246]  Well, that's the point of these staged elections, is to make us all get back into the balkanized, polarized system.
[02:09:10.266 --> 02:09:13.367]  It's like a football game or the World Series.
[02:09:13.427 --> 02:09:14.488]  Thanks for the call, George.
[02:09:14.528 --> 02:09:14.768]  Thanks.
[02:09:15.228 --> 02:09:20.111]  And hey, if that story's true, get me the details, get her in contact with me.
[02:09:20.771 --> 02:09:22.272]  That's a serious issue.
[02:09:23.217 --> 02:09:26.039]  Folks, we have federal courts convicting people.
[02:09:26.459 --> 02:09:30.401]  They'll have 500 Bush supporters on a public street with no permit.
[02:09:30.441 --> 02:09:31.181]  You don't need a permit.
[02:09:31.201 --> 02:09:31.842]  They say you do.
[02:09:31.862 --> 02:09:34.703]  It's like telling blacks they have to pay a toll tax.
[02:09:34.763 --> 02:09:36.124]  It just isn't constitutional.
[02:09:36.745 --> 02:09:38.265]  Well, so are these permits.
[02:09:38.305 --> 02:09:42.588]  If you want to take over a street, you need a permit, but not to be on the sidewalk.
[02:09:42.608 --> 02:09:44.609]  Now, that's what the law really states.
[02:09:45.822 --> 02:09:57.985]  But we have cases of 500 Bush supporters and one guy wearing a no-blood for oil, and the Secret Service walks over and orders the cops to arrest him, and then they get charged with a serious crime and end up with six months in prison.
[02:09:58.286 --> 02:10:00.726]  The judge says, absolutely, you don't have any right.
[02:10:00.746 --> 02:10:02.627]  All right, that's enough.
[02:10:03.267 --> 02:10:05.147]  I want to thank our guest for holding.
[02:10:06.628 --> 02:10:09.068]  And again, he was in this article from MSNBC.
[02:10:09.629 --> 02:10:10.849]  Policing is aggressive.
[02:10:11.898 --> 02:10:19.180]  At Bush events, the sum protesters arrest recall Vietnam War error, and it gets into that.
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:27.463]  And again, Alex Vital, a sociology professor at Brooklyn College, is in this article and joins us.
[02:10:27.523 --> 02:10:28.783]  Professor, good to have you on with us.
[02:10:29.123 --> 02:10:29.663]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:10:29.683 --> 02:10:30.123]  My pleasure.
[02:10:30.884 --> 02:10:35.025]  I mean, I agree with you that things are getting really bad.
[02:10:35.085 --> 02:10:35.565]  The police...
[02:10:36.425 --> 02:10:46.808]  Are trying to declare these new unconstitutional powers and use them, but not just with protest, but this atmosphere after 9-11 is being used to ratchet up the police state across the board.
[02:10:47.448 --> 02:10:48.488]  What are your comments to that?
[02:10:49.068 --> 02:11:01.472]  I think we're in a bad situation here where there's basically a growing intolerance, and I think it is tied to 9-11, a growing intolerance of anything that smacks of being disorderly in any way.
[02:11:01.492 --> 02:11:02.112]  I think...
[02:11:03.078 --> 02:11:19.513]  So much of the fear that was evoked from 9-11 has resulted in people being averse to anything that could be interpreted as disorderly or frightening, and that this is, in fact, going so far that it's undermining our sort of basic democratic values.
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:22.400]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:11:23.021 --> 02:11:24.361]  You study this.
[02:11:24.881 --> 02:11:30.303]  From your studies, have you seen this to be kind of a ratcheting up, an incremental development?
[02:11:30.383 --> 02:11:35.645]  Or has it really been just in the last three years that we've seen the main acceleration of this?
[02:11:36.226 --> 02:11:43.348]  Well, it started really in 1999 with the big WTO anti-globalization protests.
[02:11:44.109 --> 02:11:49.411]  As the protests became better organized and more successful, the police have become more repressive.
[02:11:49.471 --> 02:11:49.871]  But I think
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:12:06.425]  It really then went to a whole new level after 9-11 where police departments are telling people they have to have a permit for anything and then not giving them the permits and then arresting people for peacefully gathering on sidewalks for holding signs and these kinds of things.
[02:12:06.845 --> 02:12:18.409]  Well, in Seattle, I actually made a video about that police state to the takeover and we had the local newscast amateur video police admitting that there were these 50 thugs who were then housed in a government building
[02:12:19.264 --> 02:12:46.515]  And who really were working for the government, they burned trash cans, hit cops, the cops were told to take it, then they retired to a government building, and the cops then attacked old ladies, medics, you name it, and then they used that video, not my video, but the video that was shot there by the cops, as a training manual to scare police all over the country, then they federally issued all these Darth Vader riot gear outfits, the zero tolerance, and then I was in New York,
[02:12:47.316 --> 02:12:54.259]  And saw American Spectator reporters being arrested, conservatives in suits, libertarian writers, AP writers.
[02:12:54.559 --> 02:12:58.561]  We had them take our film, take our cameras, detain us.
[02:12:59.001 --> 02:13:05.383]  We'd be five miles from MSG, Madison Square Garden, have cops run over and cuss at us and say, turn your cameras off.
[02:13:05.683 --> 02:13:09.445]  It was just an arrogant strutting of letting us know that we're the little people.
[02:13:10.089 --> 02:13:20.274]  Yeah, there were a lot of problems in New York with harassment of the media and failure to abide by press credentials and trying to prevent people from taking photographs or videotape.
[02:13:21.075 --> 02:13:37.303]  And it's also certainly true that after Seattle there was a concerted effort to sort of paramilitarize the police with a lot of high-tech, very expensive weaponry and body armor and of course that poor woman who was killed in Boston after they
[02:13:38.088 --> 02:13:46.271]  Made it to the World Series was killed by one of these high-tech, so-called less lethal weapons, and I think this is a very disturbing trend as well.
[02:13:46.871 --> 02:13:52.614]  Well, I got video from Portland and Seattle and D.C.
[02:13:53.214 --> 02:13:57.435]  where these rubber bullets put huge, giant, bleeding holes in people.
[02:13:58.596 --> 02:14:01.737]  And I've talked to police and others, and I've even seen manuals,
[02:14:02.409 --> 02:14:09.294]  You're not supposed to shoot these from any closer than 50 feet away, because up closer they know full well they're lethal.
[02:14:09.794 --> 02:14:12.876]  We've now got the photos of this cop that killed her 15 feet away.
[02:14:12.896 --> 02:14:17.399]  Yeah, and in most cases they're supposed to aim at people's legs, not at their faces.
[02:14:20.041 --> 02:14:23.944]  Well, I mean, this thing hit her hard enough to push her eyeball back into her brain.
[02:14:24.671 --> 02:14:25.411]  It's just terrible.
[02:14:25.471 --> 02:14:39.276]  In Miami, during the demonstrations against the Free Trade Area of the Americas, a well-known businessman in Miami was struck by one of these rubber projectiles and caused brain damage.
[02:14:39.356 --> 02:14:47.358]  I think the weaponry had some legitimate uses, but once they have the weaponry, then they start finding new uses for it.
[02:14:47.458 --> 02:14:53.380]  They overstep the intended use of these things and can just lead to terrible abuses.
[02:14:54.440 --> 02:15:03.368]  Well, yeah, when they were first developed, it's if somebody's running at you with a butcher knife and you don't want to kill them or they're threatening to kill themselves, you shoot them with a taser or a beanbag gun.
[02:15:06.531 --> 02:15:18.543]  Yeah, and in riot situations, they can be useful in trying to create some distance between a line of police and an angry mob so that you don't get into a kind of hand-to-hand combat situation.
[02:15:19.471 --> 02:15:26.722]  But then to go ahead and just use them at close range on people because you don't like what they're saying is where we're getting into a real problem.
[02:15:27.083 --> 02:15:28.004]  Well, absolutely.
[02:15:28.185 --> 02:15:31.390]  I've got the video from around the country.
[02:15:31.490 --> 02:15:32.792]  I've been in some of these protests.
[02:15:33.516 --> 02:15:43.440]  One person does something wrong or somebody walks out in the street where they're not supposed to, and so the police go open fire and then just start in long lines shooting into an innocent crowd.
[02:15:43.460 --> 02:15:44.941]  I mean, I have video of this.
[02:15:45.041 --> 02:15:45.921]  You know, absolutely.
[02:15:45.961 --> 02:15:47.262]  That's what happened in Seattle.
[02:15:47.282 --> 02:15:50.283]  You had people sort of passively sitting on the ground.
[02:15:51.092 --> 02:16:06.680]  They may have been engaged in a violation of the traffic laws, but the police, rather than issuing them a summons or placing them in custody, just open up with the pepper spray and the rubber bullets and quite indiscriminately so that if you're just...
[02:16:08.981 --> 02:16:22.005]  Well, sir, I have video of old women, young women, they run up, knock a woman off a bike, she falls to the ground, and they start stomping her with nothing but pure pleasure.
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:42.948]  Unlike the 1960s anti-war demonstrations, the police use of violence tends to be more organized rather than the kind of police riots that we sometimes saw where you had supervisors chasing after their officers trying to get them back into line.
[02:16:43.089 --> 02:16:43.529]  Exactly.
[02:16:43.549 --> 02:16:45.170]  You got out-of-control stuff in the 60s.
[02:16:45.190 --> 02:16:46.330]  Now it's mechanized.
[02:16:46.730 --> 02:16:48.331]  Highly organized.
[02:16:48.531 --> 02:16:55.215]  I use the term command-and-control policing to describe this because it's highly organized and very hierarchical.
[02:16:56.854 --> 02:17:00.935]  It's militarized, but how do you get cops in masks to go out and beat women?
[02:17:02.076 --> 02:17:13.358]  Well, part of it is these kinds of demonizing press campaigns that you alluded to after Seattle, where they go around accusing everyone who's a demonstrator of being an anarchist or a terrorist.
[02:17:13.918 --> 02:17:24.661]  And so they kind of lay the groundwork for saying that these people aren't legitimate people, they're not real Americans, that anything that happens to them, they deserve.
[02:17:25.737 --> 02:17:26.938]  Well, it's making us the enemy.
[02:17:26.958 --> 02:17:30.520]  I mean, when you militarize the police, the military's there to kill the enemy and break things.
[02:17:30.820 --> 02:17:31.861]  Police are peace officers.
[02:17:31.881 --> 02:17:35.423]  Well, now we've got militarized police, self-described paramilitary groups.
[02:17:35.703 --> 02:17:36.624]  We're the enemy, folks.
[02:17:36.684 --> 02:17:37.744]  I mean, it's just a fact.
[02:17:38.425 --> 02:17:39.005]  Stay there, sir.
[02:17:39.085 --> 02:17:39.686]  One more segment.
[02:17:39.706 --> 02:17:40.966]  I want to talk about this some more with you.
[02:17:41.227 --> 02:17:42.688]  We'll be right back with a good professor.
[02:17:42.988 --> 02:17:44.689]  I'm Alex Jones for ThePlanet.tv.
[02:17:45.962 --> 02:17:46.202]  I think?
[02:18:00.862 --> 02:18:01.402]  We're good to go.
[02:18:30.311 --> 02:18:34.235]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:18:34.255 --> 02:18:34.955]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:18:34.975 --> 02:18:35.676]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:46.388 --> 02:18:50.052]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[02:18:50.452 --> 02:18:55.877]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[02:18:56.338 --> 02:19:01.503]  It makes me wonder if the US citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[02:19:02.154 --> 02:19:15.446]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Rule in 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[02:19:15.967 --> 02:19:21.271]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[02:19:21.572 --> 02:19:27.477]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[02:19:46.153 --> 02:19:48.636]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.656 --> 02:19:57.926]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts number one and two is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[02:19:58.907 --> 02:20:03.852]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the First, Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendment?
[02:20:04.914 --> 02:20:06.736]  This is minimum infringement.
[02:20:07.136 --> 02:20:07.917]  There may be more.
[02:20:09.079 --> 02:20:15.883]  Is your guaranteed right to freedom of speech, assembly, religion, privacy, and to own a gun important to you?

[02:21:37.402 --> 02:21:37.623]  Call today.
[02:21:49.964 --> 02:21:55.187]  You know, a lot of neocons on talk radio go, yeah, beat them protesters up, arrest them.
[02:21:55.587 --> 02:21:58.569]  What happens when you're out in a march for your Second Amendment?
[02:21:59.409 --> 02:22:00.810]  They're going to pull this on you.
[02:22:02.031 --> 02:22:06.013]  What's going to happen when you're out there protesting because homeschoolers' rights are going to be violated?
[02:22:06.493 --> 02:22:07.433]  What's going to happen to you?
[02:22:07.774 --> 02:22:11.255]  What's going to happen if it's a John Kerry or a Hillary Clinton in there later?
[02:22:11.556 --> 02:22:12.836]  See, they'll use all this on you.
[02:22:13.176 --> 02:22:15.978]  That's why you've got to be for the Bill of Rights for everybody.
[02:22:16.542 --> 02:22:19.285]  But folks, they're going after conservatives now as well.
[02:22:19.305 --> 02:22:28.435]  We're talking to Alex Vitale, and he's a sociology professor at Brooklyn College, and his website's nycjustice.org.
[02:22:32.609 --> 02:22:33.530]  Is that correct, sir?
[02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:39.373]  It's nyc-justice.nyc-justice.org, and he's in this MSNBC article.
[02:22:39.733 --> 02:22:43.735]  And if he wants to write Shotgun with us in the next segment, he can, and we'll take more of your calls and cover some other news.
[02:22:43.755 --> 02:22:50.919]  But we were talking during the break about agent provocateurs in these different organizations.
[02:22:51.639 --> 02:22:52.520]  Talk about that some.
[02:22:52.980 --> 02:22:56.962]  Well, you know, there's a long history of that in the United States, going back to the
[02:22:57.757 --> 02:23:22.175]  Early red scares in the early part of the last century, but there is a growing use of undercover and plainclothes police officers at these demonstrations who from time to time will foment some sort of altercation in the demonstration that then provides cover for the uniformed police to come in and make mass arrests or to use force against people and
[02:23:22.884 --> 02:23:38.636]  We saw some cases like that here in New York during the Republican National Convention and we've seen footage from other cities at some of these large demonstrations and it's a sign that we're returning to the age of the COINTELPRO
[02:23:39.312 --> 02:23:45.376]  ...operations where the FBI had thousands of agents infiltrating all kinds of political and religious groups.
[02:23:45.476 --> 02:23:51.901]  I was about to say, this is an intelligence operation, and then now they're telling us, ooh, we're going to have a domestic CIA.
[02:23:51.941 --> 02:23:54.402]  I mean, this is Stasi-esque.
[02:23:54.582 --> 02:23:55.563]  It's very frightening.
[02:23:55.623 --> 02:24:01.487]  I mean, it's one thing to be monitoring the Internet to keep track of people's public statements.
[02:24:01.547 --> 02:24:03.989]  It's another thing to send people in undercover...
[02:24:04.795 --> 02:24:08.016]  Well, how many millions of dollars were used from Iraq money, military money in Miami?
[02:24:08.036 --> 02:24:08.776]  Yes, quite a bit.
[02:24:08.836 --> 02:24:16.318]  Tens of millions of dollars were spent for this massive security operation to prevent some senior citizens and union members from holding a rally.
[02:24:32.805 --> 02:24:44.188]  And I interviewed 87-year-old World War II vets and union leaders, and even a federal judge got beat up, who would be marched down an alley and the cops would cuss at them and go, you pieces of filth, and beat them.
[02:24:45.368 --> 02:24:48.489]  Folks, I mean, that was even in the Miami Papers.
[02:24:48.849 --> 02:24:50.689]  You better be afraid of a government like that.
[02:24:52.149 --> 02:24:53.230]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[02:24:53.290 --> 02:24:59.291]  I think that it really is incumbent upon people to ask these tough questions about what,
[02:24:59.736 --> 02:25:07.763]  We want the role of the police to be in relationship to the First Amendment, and we have to figure out some concrete ways to take action about that.
[02:25:08.763 --> 02:25:09.744]  But here's the question.
[02:25:09.864 --> 02:25:10.865]  You said propaganda.
[02:25:10.925 --> 02:25:14.668]  How do they get, say in Miami with 8,000 cops out there or 41,000 in New York,
[02:25:17.623 --> 02:25:21.424]  And New York, by the way, wasn't as bad as some places we've been and some things we've seen, I have to be honest.
[02:25:21.584 --> 02:25:22.004]  That's true.
[02:25:22.584 --> 02:25:31.206]  But places like Miami or Portland or wherever, I mean, Portland, I wasn't there, but I've got amateur video and local newscast video and interviewed people who were there, and they admit it.
[02:25:31.626 --> 02:25:43.548]  They encircled a crowd of 4,000 or 6,000, and then they blocked off all their escape routes at 3 o'clock and 4 o'clock in the afternoon and started pepper spraying and rubber bulleting people and ran up and sprayed babies in baby carriages and
[02:25:44.148 --> 02:25:45.450]  People would say, why my baby?
[02:25:45.490 --> 02:25:47.733]  And they'd say, don't bring a baby, bleep bleep.
[02:25:48.474 --> 02:25:51.818]  I mean, how in the world did they get them to turn into such psychopaths?
[02:25:51.838 --> 02:26:02.010]  Well, and during the Bush inauguration, we have footage of undercover police officers wading into crowds, just indiscriminately pepper spraying people.
[02:26:02.611 --> 02:26:08.152]  To try and create chaos, to justify the police coming in with batons, etc.
[02:26:08.232 --> 02:26:09.913]  Yeah, they've done that in Austin.
[02:26:10.013 --> 02:26:10.353]  Why?
[02:26:10.373 --> 02:26:11.633]  What do they tell the cops?
[02:26:11.733 --> 02:26:13.954]  Well, you know, they don't just tell the cops this.
[02:26:14.014 --> 02:26:15.114]  They put it in the news.
[02:26:15.574 --> 02:26:28.958]  Here in New York, before the Republican National Convention, there were several news stories that named high-ranking police sources, police intelligence officials, and even said, we reviewed police intelligence files to...
[02:26:29.645 --> 02:26:35.671]  ...confirm that, you know, hundreds of anarchists are coming here to commit violence, etc.
[02:26:35.711 --> 02:26:40.076]  And, of course, there was no violence here during the Republican National Convention.
[02:26:40.236 --> 02:26:49.285]  And one of the things that's troubled me most about that is that both that the police are keeping these intelligence files and that they're sharing them with the media.
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:51.881]  To serve their own political purposes.
[02:26:52.081 --> 02:26:55.843]  Well, I saw something on New York One in my hotel room at 2 a.m.
[02:26:55.863 --> 02:27:00.085]  when I got home, and it shows the cops running over people with mopeds for no reason.
[02:27:00.685 --> 02:27:05.988]  And then when somebody got up and punched a cop back, that was shown locally.
[02:27:06.048 --> 02:27:08.589]  But then on national news, look at this evil guy.
[02:27:08.629 --> 02:27:10.470]  He just punched a cop for no reason.
[02:27:10.990 --> 02:27:14.092]  Yeah, I actually am the person who shot some of that footage.
[02:27:14.752 --> 02:27:17.914]  And that was an outrageous situation where...
[02:27:18.902 --> 02:27:19.262]  Stay there.
[02:27:19.282 --> 02:27:20.023]  I've got to hear this.
[02:27:20.543 --> 02:27:21.524]  I've got to hear this, Professor.
[02:27:21.544 --> 02:27:22.464]  Wow, I didn't know that.
[02:27:22.844 --> 02:27:23.685]  Small world.
[02:27:24.105 --> 02:27:25.146]  I've got the footage then.
[02:27:25.886 --> 02:27:26.626]  I've got his footage.
[02:27:27.247 --> 02:27:30.969]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break with the Professor and your calls.
[02:27:31.029 --> 02:27:35.171]  I promise.
[02:27:36.091 --> 02:27:36.992]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.472 --> 02:27:39.093]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.993 --> 02:27:42.675]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.129 --> 02:27:47.390]  You're good to go.

[02:28:45.976 --> 02:28:46.576]  Hello, folks.
[02:28:46.676 --> 02:28:47.596]  Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.736 --> 02:28:51.798]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:51.978 --> 02:28:54.838]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:54.918 --> 02:29:01.640]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.820 --> 02:29:04.841]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.041 --> 02:29:07.422]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.562 --> 02:29:12.263]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove...
[02:29:12.503 --> 02:29:13.304]  We're good to go.
[02:29:36.783 --> 02:29:37.204]  803-4438.

[02:29:45.998 --> 02:29:46.739]  We're good to go.
[02:30:07.882 --> 02:30:11.485]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.

[02:30:58.061 --> 02:31:04.646]  We're talking to Professor Alex Vitale, sociology professor at Brooklyn College, who studies police behavior.
[02:31:06.187 --> 02:31:17.015]  And, wow, yeah, they had the footage I saw on New York One where they've got the mopeds running into people and people get mad, don't like seeing women getting run over by mopeds for absolutely no reason.
[02:31:18.015 --> 02:31:23.119]  And then, by the time it hits the national news, though, they took that part out.
[02:31:23.159 --> 02:31:24.620]  But you said you were there.
[02:31:24.680 --> 02:31:25.581]  You shot that footage.
[02:31:25.601 --> 02:31:26.161]  That's amazing.
[02:31:26.181 --> 02:31:26.702]  Yep.
[02:31:27.737 --> 02:31:29.899]  Tell us about, as an eyewitness, what you saw.
[02:31:29.919 --> 02:31:33.143]  Yeah, it's important to keep in mind that these officers were not in uniform.
[02:31:34.164 --> 02:31:36.426]  These were plainclothes officers.
[02:31:36.446 --> 02:31:50.961]  It was a squad of about a dozen officers, and what happened was there was a legal march taking place, and the police ran a line of metal barricades right through the middle of the march without any warning or explanation, and people thought they were being arrested.
[02:31:51.627 --> 02:31:53.328]  So they linked arms up.
[02:31:53.689 --> 02:31:59.093]  Because that's how they'd been arresting people, was either with the orange plastic cages or the big metal cages.
[02:31:59.153 --> 02:31:59.614]  That's right.
[02:31:59.634 --> 02:32:02.316]  Just the night before, a number of people had been arrested that way.
[02:32:02.476 --> 02:32:04.077]  And so they thought they were being arrested.
[02:32:04.117 --> 02:32:05.098]  They linked arms.
[02:32:05.659 --> 02:32:16.468]  And the police attacked them with these unmarked, ununiformed motor moped officers who just rode right into the crowd, rode over people, knocked people down.
[02:32:17.028 --> 02:32:17.809]  And one of them...
[02:32:18.877 --> 02:32:22.759]  Just kept going into the middle of the crowd and knocking people over.
[02:32:22.919 --> 02:32:30.063]  And I guess eventually, some people not... He was never identifying... He never identified himself as a police officer.
[02:32:30.103 --> 02:32:34.305]  He's wearing a New York Yankees shirt and a black helmet.
[02:32:35.005 --> 02:32:37.366]  And some people pulled him off his motor scooter.
[02:32:37.386 --> 02:32:40.568]  And then punched him and kicked him.
[02:32:40.588 --> 02:32:46.111]  And then another person, a single person, then kicked him while he was on the ground.
[02:32:46.975 --> 02:32:57.047]  And that poor person is someone who was actually not connected to the demonstration and had a history of some mental problems.
[02:32:57.868 --> 02:33:03.791]  The other people in the crowd did pull the guy from the scooter, and then I guess this guy... But let me ask folks a question.
[02:33:04.292 --> 02:33:15.158]  If you're out with your wife, and a lot of people there were tourists, and people start running over you with vehicles, would you not pull them off of it, especially if they were in plain clothes?
[02:33:15.178 --> 02:33:20.921]  But even if a cop was doing it, wearing a giant police uniform, he should be pulled from the vehicle.
[02:33:21.181 --> 02:33:24.842]  Well, certainly you have an argument about self-defense in a situation like that.
[02:33:24.983 --> 02:33:27.844]  Even a uniformed police officer can't use illegal violence against you.
[02:33:27.864 --> 02:33:29.224]  So what were they trying to do?
[02:33:29.364 --> 02:33:31.385]  What were they trying to do, Professor, because I've seen the footage?
[02:33:31.485 --> 02:33:37.707]  Well, they were trying to basically clear people away from where this line of barricades was.
[02:33:37.988 --> 02:33:46.811]  But this officer went into the crowd without backup and without any clear plan about what he was trying to accomplish, and he really made a big mistake.
[02:33:49.390 --> 02:33:52.653]  Since then, the police department has quit using those officers.
[02:33:52.753 --> 02:33:57.838]  I think even they realized that this was putting their own officers in jeopardy as well as the public.
[02:33:58.553 --> 02:34:07.435]  Well, you know, by saying New York was, quote, better than other cities, at least they didn't have, you know, a thousand cops open fire with rubber bullets for absolutely no reason like other cities.
[02:34:07.875 --> 02:34:11.616]  But they were worse when it came to arresting people for having a video camera.
[02:34:11.716 --> 02:34:13.276]  It was a different strategy.
[02:34:13.316 --> 02:34:15.457]  In New York, the objective was twofold.
[02:34:15.637 --> 02:34:21.498]  One was to not have images of violence on the nightly news, and they were mostly successful at that.
[02:34:22.018 --> 02:34:24.979]  And the other was to not allow any disruptions.
[02:34:25.706 --> 02:34:31.810]  And so what they decided was that they would just arrest people before they had a chance to do anything disruptive.
[02:34:31.870 --> 02:34:33.171]  Now, was that memo real?
[02:34:33.191 --> 02:34:35.773]  Because by the time we left, we never heard anything else.
[02:34:35.873 --> 02:34:36.934]  I don't think it was.
[02:34:37.915 --> 02:34:45.120]  We couldn't ever get any independent confirmation that this was a coordinated plan in writing.
[02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:55.167]  But there was clearly a decision made at the highest levels of the department to go out there and arrest groups as they were gathering before they even began their protests.
[02:34:56.437 --> 02:35:03.995]  Well, I was at a Ground Zero protest with just a few thousand people, and I stayed a couple hundred yards away because I saw the police massing, rounding them up.
[02:35:04.574 --> 02:35:15.441]  Yeah, they just arrested 227 people at that demonstration, and the district attorney, after looking at the videotapes, dropped the charges against all of them because it was clear they weren't doing anything illegal.
[02:35:15.541 --> 02:35:15.901]  Exactly.
[02:35:15.941 --> 02:35:21.825]  So they just scooped up a portion of these thousands of people randomly with the orange freedom fencing, as they call it.
[02:35:21.965 --> 02:35:22.165]  Yep.
[02:35:22.645 --> 02:35:25.807]  And that was the American Spectator reporter.
[02:35:25.888 --> 02:35:31.191]  I was videotaping as it was happening across the street by the train station depot,
[02:35:37.487 --> 02:35:48.591]  Well, it was the front of a group that was trying to walk on the sidewalk towards Madison Square Garden to have a protest.
[02:35:48.871 --> 02:35:54.653]  And the police said, that's fine, you just have to stay on the sidewalk, not block traffic, not block pedestrians.
[02:35:55.353 --> 02:35:58.814]  And they let him get about half a block and then just arrested him anyway.
[02:35:59.074 --> 02:36:01.315]  That's what the American Spectator reporter said, too.
[02:36:01.575 --> 02:36:01.795]  Yeah.
[02:36:02.315 --> 02:36:02.995]  It was a setup.
[02:36:03.075 --> 02:36:04.175]  It was a bait-and-switch.
[02:36:04.436 --> 02:36:13.558]  And then, by the way, they then gave a false charge to him, and he said to the cop four hours later, giving him the charges at the camp, he said, you weren't there, and he goes, just shut up.
[02:36:14.078 --> 02:36:15.458]  I mean, how do you get caught?
[02:36:15.519 --> 02:36:22.120]  Coffee, professionalism, and respect is the motto of the New York City Police Department, so I guess that officer hadn't heard that.
[02:36:22.500 --> 02:36:24.541]  He's lucky they didn't come at him with a toilet plunger.
[02:36:26.266 --> 02:36:27.587]  That has been a problem as well.
[02:36:28.468 --> 02:36:36.596]  But, I mean, Professor, in closing here, where did this... I know you said the mentality, the demonization, yeah, but how do they get cops in mass?
[02:36:36.636 --> 02:36:37.777]  Is it just peer pressure?
[02:36:37.797 --> 02:36:40.019]  I mean, I know a lot of... I think it is.
[02:36:40.119 --> 02:36:50.329]  It's a just following orders kind of situation where you take a lot of young officers, there are a lot of rookies out at these demonstrations, and the high-ranking officers just tell them what to do.
[02:36:51.027 --> 02:36:54.989]  Do you think we're going to see massive riots if the election is contested November 3rd?
[02:36:55.369 --> 02:36:58.531]  Well, I think we'll certainly see millions of people out on the streets.
[02:36:59.211 --> 02:37:03.253]  Whether or not there'll be violence or property destruction, I couldn't hardly say.
[02:37:03.293 --> 02:37:11.937]  But I think certainly if Bush wins under questionable circumstances, there will be widespread public protest.
[02:37:12.397 --> 02:37:15.899]  And then you'll have provocateurs, a few hotheads that are real.
[02:37:15.919 --> 02:37:16.539]  It's possible.
[02:37:16.759 --> 02:37:18.040]  The cops will overreact.
[02:37:18.690 --> 02:37:28.959]  That is all possible, but we also don't want to be in the business of aiding the police and intimidating people from coming out on the streets when they feel they ought to.
[02:37:29.039 --> 02:37:31.921]  So while it's true that things are getting worse...
[02:37:33.567 --> 02:37:34.968]  There's still space out there.
[02:37:34.988 --> 02:37:39.311]  Well, that's an even greater reason for us to go out and march and demonstrate.
[02:37:39.692 --> 02:37:40.112]  That's right.
[02:37:40.172 --> 02:37:45.116]  We have to protect the right to be able to do that, or the situation will just get worse.
[02:37:45.136 --> 02:37:47.017]  Okay, give them your website again slowly.
[02:37:47.478 --> 02:37:53.342]  It's www.nyc-justice.org.
[02:37:54.723 --> 02:38:00.068]  Well, Professor, I really appreciate you spending time with us while I was ranting and raving.
[02:38:00.128 --> 02:38:00.568]  It's just that...
[02:38:01.167 --> 02:38:09.412]  You know, to see this transformation of our police in the last six years, five years... It's very troubling.
[02:38:09.592 --> 02:38:16.516]  And it has no basis in reality, and more times than not, they caused the riot, they caused the problem.
[02:38:16.876 --> 02:38:17.317]  That's right.
[02:38:18.277 --> 02:38:24.601]  A picture of, they say, violent demonstrators, and then if you look at the actual videotape, it's the police beating demonstrators.
[02:38:26.542 --> 02:38:28.003]  Yeah, I saw that in New York.
[02:38:28.043 --> 02:38:31.884]  There's footage of cops who start beating people with billy clubs and the people aren't doing anything.
[02:38:32.024 --> 02:38:32.944]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:38:33.605 --> 02:38:34.125]  It's amazing.
[02:38:34.205 --> 02:38:35.965]  Okay, well, Professor, thanks for coming on with us.
[02:38:36.005 --> 02:38:37.046]  Thanks for calling me, Alex.
[02:38:37.226 --> 02:38:37.626]  Thank you.
[02:38:38.126 --> 02:38:45.989]  Wow, we had Bev Harris, we had Paul Watson, we had the head of ethics and science for the British Medical Association.
[02:38:46.690 --> 02:38:48.311]  And then we have this professor on today.
[02:38:48.371 --> 02:38:51.433]  Man, my producer is just going wild here.
[02:38:51.753 --> 02:38:53.875]  We'll go to Paul and Roger and others here in a few minutes.
[02:38:53.915 --> 02:38:58.037]  Let me just run over some basic news in a Blitzkrieg fashion right now.
[02:38:59.619 --> 02:39:03.741]  Again, on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, we have all these articles posted.
[02:39:04.382 --> 02:39:15.409]  Firefighters, emergency workers, and then police are backing them up so that they found three of the four black boxes in good condition, still with the outside orange and yellow paint on them.
[02:39:16.730 --> 02:39:24.375]  And took them out of the records of the World Trade Center, Philadelphia Daily News, and they've been told to shut up about this, but they told you that all those were destroyed.
[02:39:24.855 --> 02:39:28.918]  Now, if it's got the hijackers doing this, like they say, why don't you release that?
[02:39:29.378 --> 02:39:31.339]  Haven't had time to produce the fake tapes yet?
[02:39:31.399 --> 02:39:33.080]  I know you're backlogged.
[02:39:33.801 --> 02:39:35.702]  But now that we talk about this, I'm sure you'll produce that.
[02:39:35.742 --> 02:39:37.743]  We'll see you in a couple years, and they'll say, see, we showed you.
[02:39:38.804 --> 02:39:39.004]  But...
[02:39:41.027 --> 02:39:42.868]  Why don't they show us the Oklahoma City footage?
[02:39:43.268 --> 02:39:44.548]  They've got 12 different tapes.
[02:39:45.208 --> 02:39:46.669]  Why is that national security?
[02:39:46.689 --> 02:39:49.490]  The FBI's gone public and said it shows Arabs with McVeigh.
[02:39:49.510 --> 02:39:52.191]  Because those Arabs work for the government, folks.
[02:39:52.231 --> 02:39:53.591]  That's why we even know their names.
[02:39:54.311 --> 02:39:57.252]  The same Iraqis trained in the 80s in this country were brought back home.
[02:39:58.192 --> 02:40:02.594]  CIA, FBI authenticate new Al-Qaeda terror tape.
[02:40:03.014 --> 02:40:04.674]  It says Al-CIA to report.
[02:40:05.415 --> 02:40:09.476]  And ABC News executives consider political implications of airing it
[02:40:10.515 --> 02:40:18.699]  The CIA and FBI authenticated a disturbing new LCI-8 video tape which warns the next terror attack will dwarf 9-11.
[02:40:19.300 --> 02:40:20.780]  The streets will run red with blood.
[02:40:21.020 --> 02:40:22.121]  Oh, this is old, folks.
[02:40:22.541 --> 02:40:29.025]  America will mourn in silence because they will be unable to count the number of the dead a man claims on the video.
[02:40:30.745 --> 02:40:31.366]  Pretty simple.
[02:40:32.046 --> 02:40:33.307]  Perfect timing for the election.
[02:40:33.347 --> 02:40:35.588]  Have one of their goons put this out.
[02:40:35.688 --> 02:40:39.450]  It's always uploaded by some government server in Little Rock or Houston, Texas.
[02:40:40.206 --> 02:40:41.407]  Some neocon group.
[02:40:43.188 --> 02:40:48.873]  And ABC News is now reporting on this, by the way.
[02:40:50.013 --> 02:40:57.019]  One ABC source who demanded anonymity said, Thursday morning, the network was struggling to find a correct journalistic balance.
[02:40:57.679 --> 02:41:02.943]  So that'll be... And of course, the Cornell Psychology Department has shown conclusively that
[02:41:03.573 --> 02:41:07.896]  This gets people to go along with the police state, and it boosts approval ratings for all this.
[02:41:07.916 --> 02:41:10.818]  I mean, that's common sense, but the science shows it.
[02:41:11.979 --> 02:41:21.225]  And continuing, seven homeschoolers, dads thrown into jail, families fined for refusing to send children to government institutions.
[02:41:21.845 --> 02:41:23.606]  You think RCPS is bad?
[02:41:24.227 --> 02:41:25.788]  Germany wrote the book on this.
[02:41:25.948 --> 02:41:27.949]  Actually, Franco did, but Hitler picked up on it.
[02:41:29.230 --> 02:41:32.112]  Hitler took almost a million children from homes...
[02:41:32.845 --> 02:41:38.929]  Parents who weren't politically correct, and now our government does that, but they're still doing it in Germany.
[02:41:38.969 --> 02:41:47.434]  I mean, they have admitted cases where a family goes to have their fifth child, and the German CPS workers come and just... And the high court doesn't release them, and they say, we don't care.
[02:41:47.914 --> 02:41:49.955]  And they don't even allege anything in Germany.
[02:41:49.975 --> 02:41:51.216]  They just come take your children.
[02:41:51.777 --> 02:42:00.602]  Seven homeschooling fathers in Germany spent several days in jail for refusing to pay fines that were imposed on them for failing to send their children to government schools.
[02:42:01.181 --> 02:42:14.475]  The fathers who were part of the Twelve Tribes community in the closer to Simon-Rennan, Germany, were forced to spend between six and sixteen days in what the group's website translates as a coercive jail.
[02:42:16.276 --> 02:42:17.257]  It just shows the nice...
[02:42:18.678 --> 02:42:19.599]  Families on the front.
[02:42:19.619 --> 02:42:21.240]  It's just Christian groups, of course.
[02:42:21.760 --> 02:42:27.344]  According to the group's website, which includes the chronology of its battle with the government, the men initially refused to go to jail.
[02:42:27.364 --> 02:42:32.727]  The police then picked them up and brought them to a lockup in Augsburg, Bavaria.
[02:42:33.328 --> 02:42:36.750]  On October 18th, the first father was released from custody on Sunday.
[02:42:37.350 --> 02:42:44.576]  The authorities want to bend the parents' will so that they will pay these fines, stop homeschooling their children, and instead send them to public schools.
[02:42:44.616 --> 02:42:50.381]  The mothers, three of small nursing children, are supposed to go to jail later, states the RIP's website.
[02:42:51.521 --> 02:42:52.983]  And they'll take their kids, folks.
[02:42:53.223 --> 02:42:59.007]  The site says the men appealed to police not to force their wives to jail at a later time.
[02:42:59.628 --> 02:43:01.810]  These are like German Amish folks.
[02:43:02.950 --> 02:43:04.772]  Boy, they're in a lot of trouble.
[02:43:06.091 --> 02:43:08.272]  Said the released homeschooler's dad.
[02:43:09.133 --> 02:43:16.176]  And see, they can't run here like a lot of German and Dutch immigrants did at first 250, 300 years ago.
[02:43:16.536 --> 02:43:17.937]  Because there's nowhere to run now.
[02:43:18.477 --> 02:43:22.779]  Illinois and California have tried to pass similar laws, and people of mass have just said, forget it.
[02:43:23.379 --> 02:43:28.202]  And now they're having terror drills from Michigan to Texas over the last four years that we've known of.
[02:43:28.642 --> 02:43:32.284]  It's in my film, Road to Tyranny, but it just came out in mainstream news a few weeks ago.
[02:43:32.304 --> 02:43:34.725]  That in mass, they're training them that...
[02:43:35.928 --> 02:43:37.509]  Christian homeschoolers are terrorists.
[02:43:37.890 --> 02:43:42.233]  We've now gotten documents that they're saying Orthodox Jews homeschooling.
[02:43:42.734 --> 02:43:44.195]  These communities may be terrorists.
[02:43:44.635 --> 02:43:48.558]  They're not allowing Christians to have more than four people meet at their homes for Bible studies.
[02:43:49.619 --> 02:43:57.405]  From Colorado to Florida to Texas, they're arresting Orthodox Jews who are having meetings at the rabbi's house.
[02:43:57.966 --> 02:43:59.067]  Folks, I'm not kidding.
[02:43:59.387 --> 02:44:00.188]  This is everybody.
[02:44:00.448 --> 02:44:02.710]  You don't want to be part of Rome.
[02:44:03.050 --> 02:44:04.371]  You don't want to be part of Egypt.
[02:44:04.391 --> 02:44:05.492]  You want to leave Egypt.
[02:44:06.598 --> 02:44:07.359]  You're in deep trouble.
[02:44:08.940 --> 02:44:11.782]  And so we're about to be like Germany where it's illegal.
[02:44:11.842 --> 02:44:14.064]  And they're having drills that you're terrorists right now.
[02:44:14.684 --> 02:44:15.765]  You think it's for the Arabs?
[02:44:16.005 --> 02:44:16.325]  Uh-uh.
[02:44:16.425 --> 02:44:17.926]  That's so you'll think it's popular.
[02:44:18.467 --> 02:44:19.588]  It is not for the Arabs.
[02:44:20.748 --> 02:44:22.550]  And if it was just for them, it would be bad enough.
[02:44:22.690 --> 02:44:24.111]  It is for Christians.
[02:44:24.981 --> 02:44:32.823]  And yes, to a greater degree, in Israel now, not just in the U.S., they're targeting an Israel Orthodox Jews, the secular Jews are.
[02:44:33.083 --> 02:44:36.644]  So it's the same thing whether it's Israel or Germany or England or the U.S.
[02:44:38.025 --> 02:44:46.727]  It's just targeting people that do not want to be part of your system, who want children that are intelligent and who the family educates, not you.
[02:44:48.488 --> 02:44:49.308]  Man, I'm getting mad.
[02:44:51.387 --> 02:44:52.828]  Just the nightmares out of Germany.
[02:44:52.868 --> 02:44:56.411]  Germany is the worst right now, other than Russia and China.
[02:44:57.933 --> 02:44:59.634]  I forgot, North Korea and Cuba.
[02:44:59.774 --> 02:45:02.236]  There's quite a few, so Germany's after all those countries.
[02:45:03.077 --> 02:45:05.299]  But the worst of the Western world, I should add.
[02:45:06.720 --> 02:45:14.787]  Bush website bars overseas visitors, and they're saying this because somebody hacked to attack them from overseas, so now they're blocking all foreign visitors.
[02:45:15.087 --> 02:45:16.348]  I talked to my IT guy.
[02:45:16.388 --> 02:45:17.409]  That's just not true, folks.
[02:45:17.689 --> 02:45:18.450]  That's made up.
[02:45:19.050 --> 02:45:20.031]  That has nothing to do with it.
[02:45:20.951 --> 02:45:23.253]  So don't want folks to see the internal propaganda.
[02:45:24.313 --> 02:45:26.835]  And continuing with the news, some good news here.
[02:45:26.855 --> 02:45:26.895]  U.S.
[02:45:27.375 --> 02:45:29.777]  court bars forced anthrax jabs.
[02:45:30.277 --> 02:45:31.237]  BBC, the U.S.
[02:45:31.257 --> 02:45:37.501]  military, has been ordered to suspend compulsory anthrax vaccinations for trips by a federal judge.
[02:45:39.763 --> 02:45:42.765]  And unusual activity spotted North Korean missile base.
[02:45:44.346 --> 02:45:45.086]  Report says.
[02:45:46.507 --> 02:45:48.188]  First off, let's go to a couple calls.
[02:45:48.488 --> 02:45:49.849]  And who's up first here?
[02:45:51.792 --> 02:45:52.632]  Paul in New York.
[02:45:52.672 --> 02:45:53.033]  Go ahead.
[02:45:53.073 --> 02:45:53.693]  You're on the air.
[02:45:53.713 --> 02:45:55.834]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[02:45:55.934 --> 02:45:56.214]  Good.
[02:45:56.854 --> 02:45:57.335]  Great show.
[02:45:57.395 --> 02:46:02.517]  Hey, I didn't hear you say something about XM Radio, right?
[02:46:02.537 --> 02:46:04.358]  You're not on XM yet, right?
[02:46:05.058 --> 02:46:11.161]  No, I had a guest on who's on XM Radio, and I said to her, you're on XM Radio.
[02:46:12.022 --> 02:46:12.482]  Oh, okay.
[02:46:12.562 --> 02:46:12.862]  All right.
[02:46:12.922 --> 02:46:14.463]  Well, that would be great.
[02:46:14.983 --> 02:46:16.024]  Hey, you know, I'm falling.
[02:46:16.084 --> 02:46:20.326]  I went to meet the candidates tonight at my local church the other night.
[02:46:21.025 --> 02:46:30.169]  And no candidate showed, which was pretty ironic, but only about 30 people from the Church of the Thousand Congregations showed up as well.
[02:46:30.529 --> 02:46:49.417]  But we did have the representative from the Christian Coalition there, and I brought up the fact that both members of, both Terry and Bush are Skull and Bones members, and he said, yeah, but Bush is a born-again Christian, and he ended up emailing me that famous letter that Bush wrote,
[02:46:49.824 --> 02:46:49.984]  Exactly.
[02:46:50.004 --> 02:46:50.624]  It's amazing.
[02:47:18.570 --> 02:47:33.284]  Right now, I'm driving to New Jersey to get my car out of in-town because the insurance company notified New York State that my car was going to, my insurance was going to lapse, which it never did, but they assumed that it did.
[02:47:33.784 --> 02:47:39.109]  So rather than notify New York State that my car insurance didn't lapse,
[02:47:39.879 --> 02:47:42.001]  They suspended my registration and insurance.
[02:47:42.121 --> 02:47:45.564]  And that's what all these databases with your national ID card.
[02:47:45.584 --> 02:47:48.007]  It'll be the CAPS-2 system of the airports times 100.
[02:47:48.067 --> 02:47:50.629]  And it's just all these little things.
[02:47:50.649 --> 02:47:52.991]  You've got a fine and fee, and you're out of compliance.
[02:47:53.011 --> 02:47:54.112]  We're going to arrest you.
[02:47:54.432 --> 02:47:55.453]  It's going to get worse and worse.
[02:47:55.654 --> 02:47:59.257]  Well, you know, they told me today that it's not their responsibility...
[02:47:59.717 --> 02:48:06.262]  ...to tell New York State that I have insurance, but it's their responsibility to tell New York State that I'm not going to have insurance.
[02:48:06.602 --> 02:48:11.025]  And I've been spending the whole day running back and forth from insurance to motor vehicle.
[02:48:11.325 --> 02:48:12.986]  Now I'm driving to New Jersey.
[02:48:13.226 --> 02:48:14.327]  Sir, you need to sue them.
[02:48:14.347 --> 02:48:17.730]  I mean, you had your insurance and they said it's going to lapse.
[02:48:19.091 --> 02:48:20.732]  And what, they came and picked your car up?
[02:48:21.212 --> 02:48:26.776]  Yeah, they towed it and they left my girlfriend in the middle of the road at one o'clock in the morning while she was traveling.
[02:48:27.282 --> 02:48:29.904]  And somebody, we had to go pick her up down in New Jersey.
[02:48:29.924 --> 02:48:33.546]  Somebody, you know, in New Jersey, I had to send somebody to pick her up.
[02:48:34.066 --> 02:48:37.428]  And of course, you know who runs all those towing companies in New Jersey.
[02:48:38.188 --> 02:48:38.728]  Oh, my God.
[02:48:38.748 --> 02:48:39.729]  They're called Goodfellas.
[02:48:40.149 --> 02:48:41.570]  Hey, and they run the police, too.
[02:48:41.630 --> 02:48:42.471]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:42.491 --> 02:48:43.051]  Thanks for the call.
[02:48:45.962 --> 02:48:52.807]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:53.107 --> 02:48:54.488]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.688 --> 02:48:56.889]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:57.029 --> 02:48:59.131]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:59.411 --> 02:49:04.354]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.674 --> 02:49:08.697]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.957 --> 02:49:09.358]  We're good to go.
[02:49:23.814 --> 02:49:27.556]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowars.
[02:49:27.656 --> 02:49:29.097]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[02:49:29.137 --> 02:49:29.337]  That's 888-2533-139.
[02:49:29.437 --> 02:49:31.559]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[02:49:31.659 --> 02:49:32.499]  Again, that number, 888-2533-139.
[02:49:45.473 --> 02:49:46.374]  We're good to go.
[02:49:46.414 --> 02:49:47.095]  We're good to go.
[02:50:06.417 --> 02:50:07.698]  Radioactive poisoning.
[02:50:07.778 --> 02:50:13.682]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:13.862 --> 02:50:18.966]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:19.066 --> 02:50:27.952]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:28.212 --> 02:50:31.515]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[02:50:33.596 --> 02:50:38.318]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:50:40.599 --> 02:50:43.040]  That's 888-803-4438.

[02:51:50.285 --> 02:51:54.067]  Here's an article out of the Standard Register out of Illinois.
[02:51:54.087 --> 02:51:55.008]  These are going in everywhere.
[02:51:55.028 --> 02:51:57.669]  Big Brother gets new binoculars.
[02:51:58.550 --> 02:52:04.433]  In a leap into the abyss of the surveillance society, Chicago authorities are installing a web of spy cameras linked to a sophisticated new computer.
[02:52:04.773 --> 02:52:13.898]  Programs that will not only view everyone who appears on various streets, faces, by the way, but also will alert police agents when anyone is acting suspicious.
[02:52:13.938 --> 02:52:14.979]  These are AI computers.
[02:52:15.538 --> 02:52:16.299]  What is suspicious?
[02:52:16.379 --> 02:52:26.265]  Wandering around aimlessly, lingering outside a building, pulling your car over to the shoulder of a highway, leaving a package in a doorway, and other common acts as if you have done a thousand times.
[02:52:26.685 --> 02:52:28.346]  What we're doing is totally new concepts.
[02:52:28.406 --> 02:52:32.729]  As the Director of the Intrusion Technology, it's going to take us to a whole new level.
[02:52:33.410 --> 02:52:41.625]  I'll say the Snooper Vision cameras can zoom in on you and follow you from camera to camera, recording your every move, whether or not you're doing anything wrong.
[02:52:42.126 --> 02:52:45.753]  Faceless bureaucrats will sit in an undisclosed, fortified building, monitoring the screens and...
[02:52:46.559 --> 02:52:51.423]  Dispatching armed police to accost lawyers, aimless wanderers, and other suspicious characters.
[02:52:51.463 --> 02:52:57.628]  Not only will the police place so-called smart cameras around town, but also in housing areas, in transportation.
[02:52:57.948 --> 02:53:00.070]  Yeah, Austin already has this, the buses, everything.
[02:53:00.531 --> 02:53:05.415]  And other city agencies, even street sweepers, making Chicagoans the most watched people in America.
[02:53:05.495 --> 02:53:06.716]  Orwell would be so proud.
[02:53:07.296 --> 02:53:08.978]  No, it's just because you looked at Chicago.
[02:53:09.358 --> 02:53:13.081]  Of course the authorities insist that this is for your own good, claiming we'll all be safer.
[02:53:13.361 --> 02:53:23.189]  Chicago's new surveillance director says, quote, the value we'll gain in public safety far outweighs any perception by the community that this is Big Brother who's watching.
[02:53:23.730 --> 02:53:25.772]  But wait a minute, it is Big Brother that's watching.
[02:53:26.052 --> 02:53:31.897]  Yet Chicago's mayor dismisses all of this pesky civil liberties, saying that after all, we're not inside your home or your business.
[02:53:32.277 --> 02:53:33.178]  Not yet, they're not.
[02:53:33.258 --> 02:53:34.399]  And that's not true, by the way.
[02:53:37.890 --> 02:53:45.775]  I've got stacks of articles today where they're promoting every child needs a chip, every cop needs a chip.
[02:53:46.976 --> 02:53:48.297]  But nothing on the border, though.
[02:53:48.357 --> 02:53:49.338]  Can't have that on the border.
[02:53:49.358 --> 02:53:51.820]  Real quick, let's go to a caller.
[02:53:51.860 --> 02:53:54.142]  Let's talk to John in New York City.
[02:53:54.782 --> 02:53:56.283]  Skyscrapers and everything.
[02:53:56.343 --> 02:53:56.723]  Go ahead.
[02:53:56.944 --> 02:53:57.624]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:53:58.105 --> 02:54:00.686]  Hey, I've got a court case that's eight and a half years long.
[02:54:00.987 --> 02:54:04.009]  I had milk equipment trouble as a farmer eight and a half, nine years ago.
[02:54:04.673 --> 02:54:13.580]  Both vets showed up on the farm and from 20 yards away identified a problem and threatened to take my cows off the farm and when I said none they said they weren't there and Cornell University came in and verified it and then they said they weren't there.
[02:54:14.280 --> 02:54:24.588]  I finally got to court here last July and when I went through court information from Cornell came out in the middle of court that verified my information but it was the pre-notes for the second report.
[02:54:24.728 --> 02:54:29.212]  The pre-notes said that I had milk equipment trouble, hands down, clean barn, everything in my favor and
[02:54:29.676 --> 02:54:33.137]  The second report, which was written from the first report, claimed that I had no milk equipment trouble.
[02:54:33.317 --> 02:54:38.479]  You mean the government's trying to run small people out of business and the judges and people are corrupt?
[02:54:38.579 --> 02:54:38.939]  No!
[02:54:39.119 --> 02:54:39.859]  Let me finish this.
[02:54:40.399 --> 02:54:46.481]  In the interim of all this, the court case and everything else, I had to threaten and show them the law that I wanted a copy of that report that came up in the middle of trial.
[02:54:47.210 --> 02:54:50.794]  And that's that the court wouldn't let me have it.
[02:54:50.814 --> 02:54:53.678]  Unfortunately, the show is going to end, so you have to finish up.
[02:54:53.798 --> 02:54:54.799]  Okay.
[02:54:55.239 --> 02:54:59.484]  In the intro, they changed my minutes, and they said they testified to it in court, which they did not do.
[02:54:59.724 --> 02:55:00.465]  And you're angry.
[02:55:00.485 --> 02:55:01.386]  You've been violated.
[02:55:01.526 --> 02:55:02.347]  Oh, terribly, yes.
[02:55:02.608 --> 02:55:03.549]  Well, send me the story.
[02:55:03.769 --> 02:55:05.151]  I might have you on as a guest sometime, sir.
[02:55:05.171 --> 02:55:05.851]  Thank you very much.
[02:55:06.112 --> 02:55:07.173]  Tell the whole story right now.
[02:55:07.193 --> 02:55:07.734]  Thanks for the call.
[02:55:07.794 --> 02:55:08.014]  Bye-bye.
[02:55:08.254 --> 02:55:10.495]  And I'm sorry all the other callers are patiently holding.
[02:55:10.535 --> 02:55:12.116]  I'm going to get a plug-in for my videos, though.
[02:55:12.136 --> 02:55:13.376]  I didn't do this in the first hour.
[02:55:13.856 --> 02:55:14.777]  I've made 11 films.
[02:55:14.797 --> 02:55:15.757]  The 11th film is out.
[02:55:16.137 --> 02:55:19.699]  We're offering it as low as $5.95 per DVD, okay?
[02:55:20.199 --> 02:55:22.260]  A lot of new specials have gone up on the site.
[02:55:22.660 --> 02:55:26.702]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and take advantage of all these new specials.
[02:55:27.122 --> 02:55:27.962]  Get my videos.
[02:55:28.083 --> 02:55:31.084]  Make copies of them for non-profit educational purposes.
[02:55:31.624 --> 02:55:32.544]  Get them out to folks.
[02:55:33.285 --> 02:55:34.365]  We can win this fight.
[02:55:34.425 --> 02:55:35.946]  This stuff is also out of control.
[02:55:37.821 --> 02:55:39.482]  If we expose it, they will be defeated.
[02:55:40.122 --> 02:55:41.964]  Get my 9-11 films.
[02:55:42.264 --> 02:55:43.865]  Get my new film, American Dictators.
[02:55:44.445 --> 02:55:45.626]  Get them and get them out to people.
[02:55:45.806 --> 02:55:49.909]  Infowars.com or prisonplanet.com or call toll-free to order 1-888-253-3139.
[02:55:55.791 --> 02:55:58.974]  Some of the most powerful videos out there, folks.
[02:55:59.014 --> 02:56:05.559]  And I carry a bunch of other titles, too, by other researchers.
[02:56:05.579 --> 02:56:06.279]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:56:06.579 --> 02:56:10.883]  When you call that number, you can ask about the different specials or different titles and what they're about.
[02:56:10.903 --> 02:56:12.844]  You can watch clips of them on the websites.
[02:56:12.864 --> 02:56:14.045]  888-253-3139 or Infowars.com.
[02:56:20.183 --> 02:56:23.106]  Or InfoWars.net to order via the safe, secure shopping cart.
[02:56:23.286 --> 02:56:24.727]  I'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight.
[02:56:25.408 --> 02:56:28.531]  And starting next week, new shortwave frequency during the day.
[02:56:29.171 --> 02:56:29.532]  What is it, 9.985?
[02:56:29.572 --> 02:56:31.253]  Alright, take care, folks.
