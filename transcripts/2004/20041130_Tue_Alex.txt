[00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:06.290]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.951 --> 00:00:08.011]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.732 --> 00:00:09.852]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.493 --> 00:00:11.313]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.074 --> 00:00:13.575]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.615 --> 00:00:17.297]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:21.900]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:39.116 --> 00:00:40.437]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:41.818 --> 00:00:43.679]  It's the 30th day of November 2004.
[00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:46.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.701]  We'll be live for the next three hours.
[00:00:48.362 --> 00:00:50.183]  And again, we'll have wide-open telephones.
[00:00:50.883 --> 00:00:56.206]  Any issue, any news item you'd like to discuss, any questions or comments you have.
[00:00:58.348 --> 00:01:01.450]  You know, really, I just want to get down to basics.
[00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.833]  We have a criminal elite that is totally psychopathic, running our world...
[00:01:08.208 --> 00:01:13.454]  They openly want to start culling down the population.
[00:01:13.494 --> 00:01:15.456]  They want to micromanage our lives.
[00:01:15.957 --> 00:01:17.639]  They want to force drug us.
[00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:19.120]  They're sadistic.
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.543]  They enjoy abusing populations.
[00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:28.571]  They're brainwashing the population, turning the population into demons very similar to themselves.
[00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:38.052]  The globalists are carrying out terror attacks to blame the terror attacks on foreign countries that are not under globalist control.
[00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:50.834]  The entire basis of our economy is being dismantled, but the media tells us that it's milk and honey in the streets, that everything is wonderful.
[00:01:52.334 --> 00:01:53.735]  I'm not trying to be negative.
[00:01:53.755 --> 00:01:55.815]  I'm just trying to report the facts to you.
[00:01:59.022 --> 00:02:07.025]  Again, two weeks ago they passed the New Freedom Initiative, the forced psychological testing of every child in America twice a year.
[00:02:08.265 --> 00:02:09.666]  Now let's see them try to implement it.
[00:02:10.406 --> 00:02:11.606]  Patriot Act II.
[00:02:12.547 --> 00:02:14.067]  The National ID Card.
[00:02:15.088 --> 00:02:17.188]  It is all right now in Congress.
[00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:19.929]  They're about to fire up a special session.
[00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.192]  Chairman Keene, who's in business with the Bin Laden family, head of the 9-11 Whitewash Commission,
[00:02:28.044 --> 00:02:34.657]  Came out on Meet the Press Sunday and said, basically, you better give us whatever we want or people are going to die.
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.625]  Don't make me say sick of Malkaida.
[00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:44.001]  Al-Qaeda's born again hard, and they work for us.
[00:02:44.442 --> 00:02:46.483]  And we're going to take your rights, America.
[00:02:46.763 --> 00:02:49.085]  And when we snap our fingers, buildings blow up.
[00:02:49.305 --> 00:02:50.626]  You got that, slaves?
[00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:52.788]  We're going to take your pension funds.
[00:02:52.908 --> 00:02:54.229]  We're going to trash your dollar.
[00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:56.130]  We're going to ship your jobs overseas.
[00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.411]  We're going to put face-scanning cameras everywhere.
[00:02:58.612 --> 00:03:01.233]  We're going to forcibly psychologically test all your children.
[00:03:01.534 --> 00:03:04.436]  You're going to have to have one of our ID cards to have a job.
[00:03:05.196 --> 00:03:06.437]  You think flying's tough?
[00:03:06.497 --> 00:03:08.819]  It'll be like that to walk down the street.
[00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:12.367]  This is tyranny.
[00:03:12.387 --> 00:03:15.912]  And we hope you enjoy being our slaves.
[00:03:15.973 --> 00:03:19.078]  Why don't you just go get a black ski mask and join the government?
[00:03:19.338 --> 00:03:22.684]  Why don't you come in for the big win against humanity?
[00:03:22.864 --> 00:03:25.929]  We can be like China with forced abortions.
[00:03:27.441 --> 00:03:30.483]  We can have torture in all these TV shows.
[00:03:30.723 --> 00:03:32.165]  The European Union's good.
[00:03:32.265 --> 00:03:33.165]  Torture's good.
[00:03:33.385 --> 00:03:34.947]  Breaking up the family's good.
[00:03:35.227 --> 00:03:40.191]  SWAT teaming people's homes, looking for drugs that the SWAT team's bosses shipped in is good.
[00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:42.232]  It's all so good.
[00:03:44.554 --> 00:03:46.515]  But it's not as bad as it's going to get, folks.
[00:03:47.456 --> 00:03:49.658]  You still have big pockets of resistance.
[00:03:50.038 --> 00:03:54.041]  A lot of people waking up, so they're trying to sell us on all this right now.
[00:03:54.804 --> 00:03:59.045]  And the mental sickness I'm hearing manifested is just incredible.
[00:04:01.326 --> 00:04:16.130]  I was listening to a big national talk show host this morning, and he said, you know, if somebody blew up a pipeline on Saddam, he'd just blow up the entire village.
[00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:17.771]  Maybe that's what we need to do.
[00:04:21.016 --> 00:04:22.897]  Hey, Saddam just tortured these people.
[00:04:22.917 --> 00:04:24.117]  That's what we're doing now.
[00:04:24.137 --> 00:04:24.938]  Hey, it works.
[00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:29.159]  Hey, we've hired his Republican Guard to go and torture and kill people.
[00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:29.940]  Hey, good.
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:31.600]  Whatever it takes to win.
[00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.102]  Our troops like working with guys that were shooting at them a year and a half ago.
[00:04:35.122 --> 00:04:37.943]  I mean, that's mental illness.
[00:04:38.083 --> 00:04:40.084]  Saddam is bad because he tortured.
[00:04:40.244 --> 00:04:41.564]  That's why we're going to torture.
[00:04:41.804 --> 00:04:42.965]  Because we're good.
[00:04:43.245 --> 00:04:45.766]  I mean, folks, come on.
[00:04:47.087 --> 00:04:48.307]  Saddam slaughtered whole villages.
[00:04:48.327 --> 00:04:49.307]  Well, we're doing the same.
[00:04:49.828 --> 00:04:50.468]  Go Joe.
[00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.231]  Well, it's true.
[00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:55.115]  I mean, Saddam was trained by our government and did an excellent job for them.
[00:04:56.518 --> 00:04:58.581]  They're just taking what they gave him away.
[00:04:58.621 --> 00:04:59.262]  We'll be right back.
[00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.952]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.392 --> 00:05:13.613]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.853 --> 00:05:20.895]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.275 --> 00:05:27.377]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.517 --> 00:05:28.717]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:28.897 --> 00:05:29.398]  We're good to go.
[00:05:45.857 --> 00:05:48.981]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:49.101]  866-885-6625.

[00:05:50.323 --> 00:05:50.523]  Call today.
[00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:04.360]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:08.102]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[00:06:08.202 --> 00:06:12.163]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[00:06:12.363 --> 00:06:18.545]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:26.848]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[00:06:27.248 --> 00:06:32.612]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[00:06:32.773 --> 00:06:36.536]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.777]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[00:06:38.817 --> 00:06:40.999]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:46.183]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.
[00:06:46.503 --> 00:06:51.768]  Get the powerful Black Berkey replacement filters now by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:55.151 --> 00:06:58.997]  That's 888-803-4438 and protect your family.
[00:06:59.658 --> 00:07:04.006]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:08.353]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:10.453 --> 00:07:13.115]  To use this disaster is a new world order.
[00:07:13.215 --> 00:07:16.217]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:07:16.297 --> 00:07:20.520]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:27.504]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:27.645 --> 00:07:29.706]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:30.006 --> 00:07:40.293]  Homeland security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:40.633 --> 00:07:45.994]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two and a half hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[00:07:50.836 --> 00:07:52.756]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:07:52.796 --> 00:07:53.396]  Big Brother.
[00:07:53.416 --> 00:07:54.317]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:08.713 --> 00:08:09.814]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.455 --> 00:08:11.335]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.036 --> 00:08:12.957]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.617 --> 00:08:17.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:21.944]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.964 --> 00:08:29.129]  Saddam Hussein is a mad dog killer.
[00:08:31.892 --> 00:08:34.614]  He sends out his black scorpion teams.
[00:08:35.737 --> 00:08:40.259]  To murder and butcher and rape in mass.
[00:08:40.339 --> 00:08:43.920]  They take people to a place called Abu Ghraib and other torture centers.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.840]  They pick up whole families.
[00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:49.182]  He's just horrible.
[00:08:49.242 --> 00:08:50.702]  We've got to go into Iraq.
[00:08:50.722 --> 00:08:51.762]  We've got to take him out.
[00:08:53.543 --> 00:09:00.385]  And then no one mentions who put him in, who gave him the weapons, who told him to invade Iran, who told him to go ahead and invade Kuwait.
[00:09:02.146 --> 00:09:03.786]  Twelve and a half years of sanctions.
[00:09:03.866 --> 00:09:05.007]  Million and a half dead.
[00:09:08.397 --> 00:09:11.479]  And, you know, they point out, well, that's because he didn't give the people their food.
[00:09:14.001 --> 00:09:15.222]  He kept the money for himself.
[00:09:15.302 --> 00:09:33.295]  And while it's true that our government and the UN and Saddam and all a bunch of criminals did do just that, it was the bombing itself and never having the money to fix it, not being allowed to fix it, the water treatment plants, the sewage systems, the power plants, the universities...
[00:09:37.341 --> 00:09:38.602]  It all got bombed.
[00:09:39.842 --> 00:09:41.983]  If it had a petri dish in it, it got bombed.
[00:09:43.984 --> 00:09:58.971]  And so a million and a half people die, and as they get skinnier, and as their children die, and as they fall apart, Americans gobble more pizza and drink more beer and get fatter and stupider, and more bloodthirsty, more hateful, more demonic.
[00:10:02.012 --> 00:10:06.714]  Over the 12 years, the TV shows scientifically crafted
[00:10:07.398 --> 00:10:22.062]  Teach us that torture and wickedness is good, and big government's good, and black ski masks are good, and tears down the family, and attacks strong male role models on almost every TV show you see on television.
[00:10:27.023 --> 00:10:36.185]  And then 2003 rolls around, and the liberation begins, the new freedom begins,
[00:10:37.597 --> 00:10:55.160]  And our government goes in there and blasts the entire country, every major region, with depleted uranium, which they admit kills our troops and the people of Iraq, and they bombard the Republican Guard bases, and then our troops move in there after the bombardment.
[00:10:56.961 --> 00:11:00.801]  And our troops go, hey, used to we had manuals saying this is deadly poisonous.
[00:11:01.862 --> 00:11:03.762]  It's also a heavy metal, not just radiological.
[00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:09.984]  And they said, don't worry, we'll bring in a few dump trucks and dump some sand on the ground at the blast points.
[00:11:10.665 --> 00:11:11.846]  That'll fix it for you.
[00:11:13.527 --> 00:11:15.529]  And then if you raise this, you get screamed at.
[00:11:15.589 --> 00:11:16.730]  You don't support the troops!
[00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.951]  You don't support them dying of radiation poisoning!
[00:11:18.991 --> 00:11:19.552]  You filth!
[00:11:20.152 --> 00:11:22.414]  Supporting the troops means getting even fatter!
[00:11:22.834 --> 00:11:23.975]  And eating more pizza!
[00:11:24.756 --> 00:11:26.037]  And watching Fox News!
[00:11:28.719 --> 00:11:29.860]  Okay, alright, alright.
[00:11:30.922 --> 00:11:31.442]  Okay, I'm evil.
[00:11:31.663 --> 00:11:32.063]  I'm sorry.
[00:11:32.423 --> 00:11:37.427]  Breathing DU is loving and good to the troops, and giving them deadly experimental injections is good.
[00:11:37.467 --> 00:11:38.307]  Just, alright!
[00:11:39.849 --> 00:11:40.329]  Alright!
[00:11:40.549 --> 00:11:41.190]  You're right!
[00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:42.150]  I was wrong!
[00:11:42.631 --> 00:11:43.411]  All along!
[00:11:45.593 --> 00:11:46.393]  Point taken!
[00:11:47.494 --> 00:11:48.215]  Touché!
[00:11:48.815 --> 00:11:50.316]  You've really gotten me now!
[00:11:51.257 --> 00:11:52.278]  Alright, I'll shut up!
[00:11:52.938 --> 00:11:57.982]  I'll put a plastic flag, made in China by a slave, on my car...
[00:11:59.586 --> 00:12:03.109]  And it's not a desecrated American flag made by slaves in communist China.
[00:12:03.209 --> 00:12:05.470]  It is a new freedom flag.
[00:12:09.453 --> 00:12:21.601]  And so then they go in and immediately hire literally 98% of Saddam's former mechanism of oppression and control.
[00:12:23.663 --> 00:12:26.064]  After all, our government helped train all his boys.
[00:12:27.385 --> 00:12:28.446]  That's admitted, by the way.
[00:12:29.125 --> 00:12:29.885]  Oh, they were at U.S.
[00:12:29.925 --> 00:12:33.167]  bases all over, learning how to hook electrodes to people's genitalia.
[00:12:33.687 --> 00:12:40.249]  We've got a lot to teach, a lot that we learned from Klaus Barbie, who taught us how to be evil.
[00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:41.130]  I mean good.
[00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:44.091]  I'm sorry, I'm learning how all this works.
[00:12:45.291 --> 00:12:49.453]  And now they've got all the Scorpion teams running around, slaughtering.
[00:12:51.994 --> 00:13:01.704]  Now, if somebody takes a pot shot at one of our trips, they just bulldoze every date palm and every tangerine orchard, just literally.
[00:13:01.764 --> 00:13:12.315]  And then the mainstream reports, by mainstream, and they're all over the international press, a woman just goes and sits in the dust with her children and says, I'm waiting to die.
[00:13:12.336 --> 00:13:13.777]  And they do!
[00:13:13.837 --> 00:13:14.478]  They die!
[00:13:17.113 --> 00:13:17.273]  I think.
[00:13:17.293 --> 00:13:17.573]  I think.
[00:13:39.708 --> 00:13:43.290]  Alciata might get activated by your globalist bosses.
[00:13:43.771 --> 00:13:45.772]  They might come do something, but that's not the real judgment.
[00:13:45.812 --> 00:13:47.473]  That's the globalist trying to keep you in line.
[00:13:47.873 --> 00:13:56.298]  The judgment is your global masters are going to rape you financially, and they're going to forcibly drug you and your family, and then they're going to give you the New World Order.
[00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:08.346]  And you're going to grasp and beg and bow down like a cur dog at their feet as things get worse, hoping that if you just kiss up to them, everything will be okay.
[00:14:10.365 --> 00:14:11.726]  You forgot your birthright.
[00:14:11.766 --> 00:14:13.467]  You forgot what it was to be an American.
[00:14:13.687 --> 00:14:15.268]  You forgot what this country was about.
[00:14:15.528 --> 00:14:16.849]  You forgot your soul.
[00:14:17.109 --> 00:14:18.310]  You forgot your conscience.
[00:14:22.712 --> 00:14:25.774]  Our discernment went away a long time ago.
[00:14:25.794 --> 00:14:34.439]  And the world I'm talking about, the America I'm talking about, isn't even the majority.
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:38.361]  But it's the America that's in control.
[00:14:40.965 --> 00:14:48.290]  And it's an America made up of so-called liberals and so-called conservatives and so-called libertarians and everybody else, so-called Christians.
[00:14:50.271 --> 00:14:58.516]  The liberals don't care if their leaders are really warmongers and are for the exact same agenda of George Bush.
[00:14:59.357 --> 00:15:01.278]  And the so-called conservatives, they don't care.
[00:15:01.298 --> 00:15:06.241]  The Supreme Court says we're not going to hear the gay marriage issue.
[00:15:06.261 --> 00:15:06.361]  We're...
[00:15:07.768 --> 00:15:11.472]  We're going to take your property with no just compensation.
[00:15:11.513 --> 00:15:13.615]  We're going to uphold warrantless checkpoints.
[00:15:14.937 --> 00:15:25.109]  I don't care if Bush appoints a new cabinet full of gun-grabbing, open-border promoting, torture-loving, abortion-pushing evil creatures.
[00:15:26.989 --> 00:15:28.630]  I mean, I've heard them on the Christian shows.
[00:15:28.690 --> 00:15:30.191]  Praise God, we've been healed.
[00:15:30.592 --> 00:15:34.574]  We've been given... George Bush is a blessing, a man of God.
[00:15:35.055 --> 00:15:36.315]  Literally a prophet.
[00:15:36.716 --> 00:15:38.157]  They're now calling him a prophet.
[00:15:40.778 --> 00:15:41.359]  A Mahdi.
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:43.100]  A leader.
[00:15:44.681 --> 00:15:45.302]  A fuhrer.
[00:15:48.324 --> 00:15:55.889]  And so, in Iraq, with the election less than two months away...
[00:15:57.782 --> 00:16:01.885]  No one is running for any of the 300-plus regional posts.
[00:16:02.406 --> 00:16:06.709]  No one is running against any of those publicly installed by the globalists.
[00:16:08.250 --> 00:16:09.911]  But the average American doesn't know that.
[00:16:11.012 --> 00:16:12.874]  It's admitted in the fine print in the back of the paper.
[00:16:12.954 --> 00:16:15.796]  They just hear freedom is being spread in Iraq.
[00:16:15.836 --> 00:16:16.116]  Yes.
[00:16:18.898 --> 00:16:25.744]  And then I hear a national talk show host this morning say, well, you know, they blew up another pipeline over there.
[00:16:25.764 --> 00:16:27.425]  Well, you know how Saddam handled that.
[00:16:28.576 --> 00:16:30.937]  I'm not saying he's good, but he sure knew how to handle it.
[00:16:30.977 --> 00:16:32.658]  Maybe we shouldn't do it that way.
[00:16:33.598 --> 00:16:35.239]  He just would blow up a whole village.
[00:16:35.299 --> 00:16:36.660]  That's how he did it.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:37.961]  Maybe we've got to get top.
[00:16:39.361 --> 00:16:42.583]  And I hear the neocon followers calling in, nuke them, nuke them, nuke them.
[00:16:42.783 --> 00:16:43.503]  Kill all of them.
[00:16:43.563 --> 00:16:44.043]  Kill them.
[00:16:44.083 --> 00:16:44.564]  Kill them.
[00:16:44.724 --> 00:16:45.584]  They're not human.
[00:16:45.624 --> 00:16:46.064]  Kill them.
[00:16:46.104 --> 00:16:46.705]  Subhuman.
[00:16:46.745 --> 00:16:48.165]  I've even heard that in the host.
[00:16:48.245 --> 00:16:48.646]  Yes.
[00:16:48.766 --> 00:16:49.166]  Yes.
[00:16:49.626 --> 00:16:49.926]  Yes.
[00:16:49.986 --> 00:16:50.567]  Subhuman.
[00:16:50.607 --> 00:16:51.047]  Yes.
[00:16:51.127 --> 00:16:51.547]  Yes.
[00:16:52.447 --> 00:16:52.848]  Yes.
[00:16:53.948 --> 00:16:57.630]  Oh, they're just having fun at Auburn Grail, blowing off a little steam, beating people to death.
[00:17:01.306 --> 00:17:02.386]  I mean, Saddam was evil.
[00:17:02.426 --> 00:17:03.967]  He tortured them, so let's torture them.
[00:17:07.768 --> 00:17:08.748]  And our trip's going.
[00:17:08.948 --> 00:17:12.929]  I don't care if the people we're working with were shooting at us a year and a half ago.
[00:17:13.809 --> 00:17:17.750]  They don't like insurgents, and they're good at dealing with an unruly populace.
[00:17:19.151 --> 00:17:20.791]  I love black scorpions.
[00:17:21.071 --> 00:17:23.392]  They're men, according to my own heart.
[00:17:24.352 --> 00:17:25.312]  No scorps.
[00:17:25.332 --> 00:17:28.793]  I mean, these are the type of quotes.
[00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:31.664]  I tell you, these are some tough dudes.
[00:17:31.704 --> 00:17:32.285]  We like them.
[00:17:33.766 --> 00:17:37.789]  Besides, I'm old enough to have been trained with them back in the 80s.
[00:17:37.869 --> 00:17:41.712]  I'm an old special forces colonel, and I trained with a lot of these men.
[00:17:41.732 --> 00:17:43.953]  These are good men.
[00:17:44.594 --> 00:17:47.196]  They know how to deal with populations.
[00:17:50.358 --> 00:17:51.619]  So imagine the Iraqis.
[00:17:51.639 --> 00:17:54.782]  I mean, they see all of Saddam's people put back into control.
[00:17:54.802 --> 00:17:58.244]  Only 98% of them.
[00:18:00.563 --> 00:18:06.107]  They see power about seven, eight hours a day in the best cities.
[00:18:06.967 --> 00:18:15.153]  Their water is full of filth, dysentery, adults, children dying in mass of dysentery, of diarrhea, amoebic dysentery.
[00:18:19.856 --> 00:18:24.899]  But it doesn't matter because the American people want to rationalize it and go, oh no, we brought them freedom.
[00:18:24.939 --> 00:18:26.280]  I heard it on Fox News, Fox News.
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:27.441]  I heard it on CNN.
[00:18:27.461 --> 00:18:27.541]  CNN.
[00:18:33.163 --> 00:18:38.888]  Meanwhile, the very same elite that the public feels like they're members of is dismantling this country.
[00:18:42.070 --> 00:18:44.552]  Dismantling it right in front of our very eyes.
[00:18:47.394 --> 00:18:50.477]  We've got to get around this compartmentalization.
[00:18:51.958 --> 00:18:54.460]  We've got to realize how we're all affected by this.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:59.564]  We've got to look at the legions of crimes committed by those running this government.
[00:19:00.501 --> 00:19:04.124]  And realize the true nature of evil that we're facing.
[00:19:06.926 --> 00:19:10.288]  You know, they're very good at putting it in black and white connotations.
[00:19:11.349 --> 00:19:20.355]  Of, well, they're the foreigners, they're evil, they don't look like us, they attacked us, we're fighting them over there so we don't have to fight them over here.
[00:19:24.038 --> 00:19:29.442]  Well, even if those people over there really were terrorists, and it wasn't some CIA manufactured threat,
[00:19:32.170 --> 00:19:34.531]  There are some real terrorists, real copycats.
[00:19:36.412 --> 00:19:39.774]  Why then are the visas being issued at record levels for Muslim countries?
[00:19:40.294 --> 00:19:41.815]  Why are the borders totally open?
[00:19:44.016 --> 00:19:45.196]  You see, it's a fraud.
[00:19:46.477 --> 00:19:54.621]  All this police state is a straitjacket being put on all of us, so when the globalists have their way with us here very soon, we won't be able to fight back.
[00:19:55.241 --> 00:19:56.322]  Do you understand that?
[00:19:57.402 --> 00:19:58.823]  We'll be right back with a ton of news.
[00:19:58.843 --> 00:20:00.864]  Your calls, presentplanet.tv.
[00:20:00.984 --> 00:20:01.404]  Stay with us.
[00:20:02.179 --> 00:20:06.822]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, a pharmacist from Mark's Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[00:20:06.942 --> 00:20:07.343]  Hi, Alan.
[00:20:07.363 --> 00:20:08.183]  Welcome to the program.
[00:20:08.363 --> 00:20:08.924]  Thank you, Marvin.
[00:20:09.124 --> 00:20:12.466]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[00:20:12.646 --> 00:20:13.187]  Is that true?
[00:20:13.407 --> 00:20:14.388]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[00:20:14.408 --> 00:20:17.390]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.690]  prices.
[00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:19.972]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[00:20:19.992 --> 00:20:20.772]  They're very common.
[00:20:20.852 --> 00:20:24.035]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[00:20:24.075 --> 00:20:24.335]  price.
[00:20:24.595 --> 00:20:25.756]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[00:20:25.776 --> 00:20:28.198]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[00:20:28.398 --> 00:20:32.221]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[00:20:32.241 --> 00:20:32.502]  price.
[00:20:32.882 --> 00:20:35.264]  Now are these brand name products made by the same companies?
[00:20:35.564 --> 00:20:37.546]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[00:20:37.586 --> 00:20:39.648]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[00:20:39.868 --> 00:20:44.793]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.
[00:20:45.074 --> 00:20:46.996]  To find out more, call toll-free 1-800-840-0686.
[00:20:47.016 --> 00:20:47.456]  That's 1-800-840-0686.
[00:20:47.476 --> 00:20:48.958]  Or go on the web at www.canshipdrugs.com.
[00:21:01.658 --> 00:21:02.278]  Hello, folks.
[00:21:02.378 --> 00:21:03.279]  Alex Jones here.
[00:21:03.419 --> 00:21:07.520]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.541]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:21:10.621 --> 00:21:17.343]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract water-borne contaminants.
[00:21:17.523 --> 00:21:20.524]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:21:20.724 --> 00:21:23.125]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:21:23.245 --> 00:21:31.128]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as
[00:21:31.288 --> 00:21:33.429]  Lactazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[00:21:33.590 --> 00:21:34.370]  MTBE.
[00:21:34.570 --> 00:21:34.870]  Radon-222.
[00:21:34.890 --> 00:21:37.452]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[00:21:37.612 --> 00:21:38.433]  Even nitrates.
[00:21:38.733 --> 00:21:42.736]  And unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:21:42.876 --> 00:21:50.501]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:21:50.541 --> 00:21:50.841]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:21:50.861 --> 00:21:52.822]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[00:22:01.451 --> 00:22:03.193]  By now, you've heard about DirecTV.
[00:22:03.393 --> 00:22:11.319]  You've heard that with DirecTV, you get a better value than cable, a better selection than cable, and access to exclusive programming that you can't get anywhere else.
[00:22:11.539 --> 00:22:13.781]  But for whatever reason, you thought there was a catch.
[00:22:14.061 --> 00:22:15.603]  Maybe even hidden fees.
[00:22:15.843 --> 00:22:17.444]  Well, Expert Satellite can help.
[00:22:17.684 --> 00:22:19.786]  And we've done it for hundreds of thousands already.
[00:22:20.026 --> 00:22:24.488]  Just give us a call at 1-800-655-0658.
[00:22:24.988 --> 00:22:28.690]  Within seconds, we'll compare DIRECTV to your cable bill right over the phone.

[00:22:50.466 --> 00:22:50.767]  That's 800-655-0658.
[00:22:50.807 --> 00:22:52.428]  Call now for complete details.
[00:22:52.488 --> 00:22:53.249]  Conditions apply.
[00:23:00.885 --> 00:23:07.090]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:23:07.550 --> 00:23:15.316]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:23:15.677 --> 00:23:23.523]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes?
[00:23:23.823 --> 00:23:24.604]  We're good to go.
[00:23:24.624 --> 00:23:25.144]  We're good to go.
[00:23:51.966 --> 00:23:54.088]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:54.228 --> 00:23:55.809]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:23:55.889 --> 00:24:09.701]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:24:10.301 --> 00:24:13.264]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:16.321 --> 00:24:20.584]  Alright, I've gotten my little diatribe, my little rant out of the way.
[00:24:20.665 --> 00:24:26.389]  Coming up in the next segment, we're going to go to your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:37.598]  I wanted to go back over some of the provisions of Patriot Act 2 that's on the verge of passing, and I wanted to show you some of the other legislation they've been trying to pass over the last few years at state levels.
[00:24:38.799 --> 00:24:41.201]  Like Senate Bill 742, which would make
[00:24:44.767 --> 00:24:49.570]  Putting any false information on a gun purchase form, life in prison.
[00:24:50.971 --> 00:24:53.012]  Or downloading music, life in prison.
[00:24:53.572 --> 00:25:03.778]  I have the bill that almost passed her in front of me, and then I pulled out another article, you know, where the guy, the paper terrorist, he sued the government over him trying to take his land, so they gave him five years in prison.
[00:25:03.798 --> 00:25:04.599]  The prosecutor wanted 50.
[00:25:05.439 --> 00:25:09.402]  Saying, suing the government, his harassment, you get five years in prison.
[00:25:09.422 --> 00:25:12.844]  It's like the doctor who was calling too much up in Iowa
[00:25:16.218 --> 00:25:19.260]  Gulf War I veteran didn't have any criminal record.
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:26.686]  They had admitted Homeland Security, and the article said, well, he didn't threaten anybody, but calling too much is harassment and thus terrorism.
[00:25:27.186 --> 00:25:28.467]  So they came and arrested him.
[00:25:28.547 --> 00:25:29.728]  We interviewed the doctor.
[00:25:30.689 --> 00:25:37.234]  The woman selling knockoff Rubik's Cubes that were totally legal gets a Homeland Security visit, and they told her, we're over the entire economy, ma'am.
[00:25:38.936 --> 00:25:40.737]  So I wanted to cover some of this.
[00:25:40.757 --> 00:25:41.398]  Here's another one.
[00:25:41.438 --> 00:25:42.518]  Associated Press today...
[00:25:44.145 --> 00:25:46.530]  Mole security gets terrorism training.
[00:25:47.272 --> 00:25:51.341]  Gripping a bag tightly defined as hallmark of terrorism.
[00:25:54.014 --> 00:25:56.875]  And just many different reasons.
[00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:58.395]  It's like the truck drivers have been told.
[00:25:58.455 --> 00:26:00.496]  A man and woman arguing on the side of the road.
[00:26:01.056 --> 00:26:02.296]  Someone wearing a backpack.
[00:26:02.336 --> 00:26:03.037]  Call the government.
[00:26:03.697 --> 00:26:04.277]  Drugs.
[00:26:04.337 --> 00:26:06.077]  Look for drugs, because that's terrorism.
[00:26:06.097 --> 00:26:10.239]  We've got to spy on each other to stop Al-Qaeda.
[00:26:10.299 --> 00:26:15.040]  And then, oh, there's no real Al-Qaeda around, so did you see people arguing with each other?
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.300]  That could be family violence.
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:18.121]  Did you smell marijuana?
[00:26:18.921 --> 00:26:19.742]  Did you smell it?
[00:26:19.762 --> 00:26:20.643]  That's in the handbook.
[00:26:20.663 --> 00:26:25.009]  Well, go ahead and call the SWAT team then, because they might be out cutting.
[00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:27.612]  So we'll go over that.
[00:26:27.812 --> 00:26:30.795]  Blair presses case for National ID cards.
[00:26:31.256 --> 00:26:37.343]  Funny how they're about to pass them in England, right as they're about to have a special session to pass them here.
[00:26:38.249 --> 00:26:39.630]  Everything happens in the same order.
[00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:43.793]  They passed laws in England for forced psychological testing of the kiddies.
[00:26:44.573 --> 00:26:46.475]  It isn't quite as draconian as what we have here.
[00:26:46.735 --> 00:26:48.636]  See, everything's the same system.
[00:26:51.078 --> 00:26:55.241]  Everything is done in the same order.
[00:26:55.261 --> 00:26:56.822]  It's a new world.
[00:26:58.723 --> 00:27:03.026]  He threatens more terror if no 911 police state bill is passed.
[00:27:04.242 --> 00:27:04.863]  Listen to this.
[00:27:05.083 --> 00:27:08.206]  Setting protections on human ID chips.
[00:27:09.067 --> 00:27:15.273]  And the article by Mike Langberg, Knight Ritter News Service, just says we need to take the chip.
[00:27:15.373 --> 00:27:15.853]  It's good.
[00:27:15.913 --> 00:27:16.814]  Stop being dumb.
[00:27:18.516 --> 00:27:19.377]  I've got to read this.
[00:27:19.937 --> 00:27:20.698]  It's wonderful.
[00:27:20.778 --> 00:27:22.239]  It's absolutely fabulous.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.984]  Also, federal plan to keep data on students worries some.
[00:27:28.118 --> 00:27:31.001]  The head of Central Command says we've got to regulate the Internet.
[00:27:31.362 --> 00:27:33.244]  The Pentagon says it's just aiding terrorists.
[00:27:33.264 --> 00:27:35.346]  We've got to start regulating the net right now.
[00:27:37.148 --> 00:27:38.510]  And more freedom.
[00:27:38.550 --> 00:27:41.653]  Bush nominates Cuban-born Gutierrez to commerce.
[00:27:43.876 --> 00:27:45.978]  The big executive...
[00:27:46.633 --> 00:27:48.574]  Of course, he's obviously not as bad.
[00:27:49.095 --> 00:27:51.676]  We've done some research on him as Alberto Gonzalez.
[00:27:52.136 --> 00:27:54.178]  Mr. I wrote the Patriot Act 2.
[00:27:54.258 --> 00:27:57.820]  Mr. I think enemy combatant designation for any misdemeanor is good.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.522]  Mr. The president is above the law.
[00:28:01.963 --> 00:28:05.265]  But again, whoever thought you'd be reading headlines like this?
[00:28:05.345 --> 00:28:06.466]  I see these every week.
[00:28:08.747 --> 00:28:11.048]  Wall-to-wall positive in major polls.
[00:28:11.809 --> 00:28:14.891]  97% of America is against implantable chips.
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:17.141]  That poll was a year ago now.
[00:28:17.221 --> 00:28:19.242]  Now it's about 90% last poll I saw.
[00:28:19.503 --> 00:28:21.324]  They're starting to condition the weak-minded.
[00:28:21.344 --> 00:28:26.607]  This is Knight Ritter News Service posted in Seattle Times.
[00:28:27.448 --> 00:28:29.809]  Setting protections on human ID chips.
[00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:34.332]  I'm rolling up my sleeve, ready to get injected with a Verichip.
[00:28:35.053 --> 00:28:36.694]  That's the device cleared by the U.S.
[00:28:36.714 --> 00:28:44.439]  Food and Drug Administration in October as the first implantable electronic identification tag linked to a person's medical profile.
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:52.843]  Privacy advocates, of course, are hugely concerned about creepy ways in which VeriChip people could be tracked by schools, employers, and government.
[00:28:54.084 --> 00:29:06.709]  These concerns are legitimate, but it would be a mistake for our society to walk away from the benefits of the VeriChip and similar technology.
[00:29:07.329 --> 00:29:13.912]  So I'm going to immodestly propose some laws we need to protect ourselves.
[00:29:16.972 --> 00:29:23.996]  And he just came out and he says, first, however, it's important to understand what the very chip is and is not.
[00:29:24.716 --> 00:29:31.659]  And then he goes into a lavish support of you getting your chip and getting it very soon.
[00:29:31.719 --> 00:29:33.900]  Maybe you need to be forced to.
[00:29:34.641 --> 00:29:36.662]  Maybe that's when real freedom starts.
[00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:41.924]  After all, our mainstream media has told us Mercury is nutritious for us now.
[00:29:43.105 --> 00:29:45.186]  They've told us the New World Order is good, too.
[00:29:46.710 --> 00:29:47.511]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:47.531 --> 00:29:49.192]  Stay with me, personplanet.tv.
[00:29:51.635 --> 00:29:52.535]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.036 --> 00:29:54.637]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.558 --> 00:29:58.241]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.375 --> 00:30:03.895]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:30:03.955 --> 00:30:06.356]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[00:30:06.716 --> 00:30:07.576]  Let me rephrase that.
[00:30:07.956 --> 00:30:09.156]  Oil War III has started.
[00:30:09.497 --> 00:30:11.937]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[00:30:12.337 --> 00:30:15.738]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[00:30:16.158 --> 00:30:19.979]  Why else would the US be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[00:30:20.239 --> 00:30:21.479]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[00:30:21.959 --> 00:30:26.420]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:30.821]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[00:30:31.381 --> 00:30:37.265]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[00:30:37.525 --> 00:30:43.629]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[00:30:44.150 --> 00:30:44.470]  That's 800-453-2202.
[00:30:44.730 --> 00:30:50.394]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[00:30:50.834 --> 00:30:52.735]  That's 1-800-453-2202 or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[00:30:52.755 --> 00:30:53.076]  That's 800-453-2202.
[00:31:00.979 --> 00:31:02.940]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:03.681]  Hello, folks.
[00:31:03.801 --> 00:31:13.747]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.108 --> 00:31:18.650]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.710 --> 00:31:30.058]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.638 --> 00:31:37.488]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[00:31:37.889 --> 00:31:40.012]  Your purified water is now ready.
[00:31:40.513 --> 00:31:45.480]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:52.085]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:31:52.146 --> 00:31:56.349]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:31:56.569 --> 00:31:57.450]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:32:02.398 --> 00:32:04.299]  SuperSilver's combination of supercharged silver and oxygen
[00:32:25.108 --> 00:32:37.960]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[00:32:38.301 --> 00:32:44.587]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.
[00:32:44.987 --> 00:32:46.128]  We're so sure it works, we guarantee it.
[00:32:46.148 --> 00:32:47.249]  That's 1-800-974-1879 or visit supersilver.net.
[00:33:09.155 --> 00:33:09.755]  1-800-259-9231, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:09.775 --> 00:33:22.004]  John in Texas, Margaret in Illinois, Aaron in Michigan, Kevin in Boston, Mass.
[00:33:22.405 --> 00:33:26.147]  Your calls are all coming up here in a few minutes, but understand the psychology.
[00:33:26.648 --> 00:33:38.016]  Shows like CSI and a bunch of others, all the coolest people having plantable chips, not just the spies, but the club goers at the most awesome clubs, only the coolest people go.
[00:33:39.620 --> 00:33:40.761]  Hundreds of news reports.
[00:33:40.861 --> 00:33:41.701]  Everybody needs one.
[00:33:41.741 --> 00:33:42.502]  It's so cool.
[00:33:43.382 --> 00:33:53.227]  Now, the polls are 90-plus percent against it, but the mainstream media keeps acting in concert like it's normal and cool and everything's great.
[00:33:54.067 --> 00:33:59.110]  And then conservative talk show hosts, the supposed alternative to the liberal media, they won't talk about it.
[00:34:00.151 --> 00:34:01.811]  Or if they do, they're like Sean Hannity.
[00:34:02.272 --> 00:34:03.812]  Oh, man, I'm investing in the company.
[00:34:03.892 --> 00:34:05.173]  Oh, I got the CEO on.
[00:34:05.553 --> 00:34:06.834]  Everybody needs a chip.
[00:34:07.463 --> 00:34:10.185]  I've got him on TV from Fox News, and I've heard him on the radio.
[00:34:13.187 --> 00:34:15.028]  So it's just wall-to-wall, get your chip.
[00:34:15.048 --> 00:34:16.569]  You know, this is freedom.
[00:34:17.629 --> 00:34:28.316]  And then I've got this Knight Ritter News article posted in the Seattle Times up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com, and he says, I want to get the chip.
[00:34:28.636 --> 00:34:31.298]  We just read that, but there's got to be some protections.
[00:34:33.075 --> 00:34:35.537]  And then he goes into, Verichip is not a new technology.
[00:34:35.597 --> 00:34:36.498]  See, it's okay.
[00:34:36.858 --> 00:34:38.980]  Applied Digital, we told you they do this.
[00:34:39.961 --> 00:34:40.822]  The dogs have had it.
[00:34:41.242 --> 00:34:50.910]  Applied Digital of Delray Beach, Florida, which developed the product, has sold 30 million virtually identical implantable ID chips for pets and livestock in the past 15 years.
[00:34:51.471 --> 00:34:56.275]  Yeah, a lot of cities have made it the law that you've got to have one of these now.
[00:34:57.056 --> 00:34:58.277]  One of them is San Francisco.
[00:34:58.777 --> 00:35:00.619]  Thousands of lost dogs and cats...
[00:35:01.351 --> 00:35:09.473]  Without external ID tags, they've been reunited with their owners because the pets had ID chips that were scanned at animal shelters.
[00:35:10.893 --> 00:35:12.153]  VeriChip is very simple.
[00:35:12.914 --> 00:35:20.175]  A glass capsule the size of a grain of rice and a 16-digit ID radio transmitter number, and it goes through how good it is.
[00:35:20.535 --> 00:35:23.276]  There are no batteries in the VeriChip, and it works for a lifetime.
[00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:33.273]  The only way to get meaningful information on the Verichip, which will initially cost $150 for a human version, is by linking the ID number to a computer database.
[00:35:34.293 --> 00:35:44.917]  The database might give a dog's name and home address at an animal shelter or show the history or advantage of drug reactions in an unconscious human in a hospital recovery room.
[00:35:45.848 --> 00:35:55.431]  Of course, a Verichip implanted for medical reasons could be used in other ways, such as tracking movement in a building through scanners built in the doorways, already going in to read passes.
[00:35:56.172 --> 00:36:02.154]  Applied Digital is interested in expanding to non-medical uses, including credit card verification and security.
[00:36:02.634 --> 00:36:12.458]  In July, the Attorney General of Mexico said he and 160 of his top officials have received Verichip injections for gaining access to top secret offices.
[00:36:12.718 --> 00:36:13.418]  Let me just stop.
[00:36:14.528 --> 00:36:15.988]  First they said 300, then 900, then 1,000.
[00:36:16.328 --> 00:36:21.189]  Now Catherine Albrecht's reporting that it's only 18 people.
[00:36:22.370 --> 00:36:25.070]  And that would fit with past activities of Verichip.
[00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:30.951]  They claim that all the big hospitals in Miami have gotten the readers.
[00:36:31.511 --> 00:36:34.032]  And it turned out they'd given one reader to one hospital.
[00:36:34.072 --> 00:36:35.872]  So, very dishonest.
[00:36:36.713 --> 00:36:41.814]  As I said, I'm willing to get a Verichip if the product adds to my personal safety and convenience.
[00:36:41.834 --> 00:36:43.594]  But I also want to know up front...
[00:36:44.901 --> 00:36:53.627]  That the implanted ID chips won't send us down a slippery slope to a Big Brother society where every move is monitored.
[00:36:58.110 --> 00:37:02.493]  So, the guy is, oh, I'm reasonable.
[00:37:02.574 --> 00:37:03.314]  I want the chip.
[00:37:03.374 --> 00:37:03.894]  It's great.
[00:37:03.914 --> 00:37:06.656]  Just have some reasonable protections, please.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:11.500]  And
[00:37:12.173 --> 00:37:19.817]  The average person reads this, and if they read this enough, in this yuppie mindset world where everything is just what the TV says, that's how you govern your mind.
[00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:21.298]  You don't have any morals of your own.
[00:37:21.318 --> 00:37:24.740]  Pretty soon it's, well, we're all the weirdos who are against the chip.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:37.267]  Remember, I was the weirdo who talked about the plan to chip you and how they'd promote it from the federal documents, by the way, six, seven, eight years ago, and then now it's all been rolled out, and then now I'm not the kook for saying it exists.
[00:37:37.627 --> 00:37:39.428]  I'm the kook for being against it.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.520]  But we're not the kooks.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:42.400]  We're the majority.
[00:37:42.781 --> 00:37:45.801]  But the mainstream media keeps acting like we're weird.
[00:37:46.262 --> 00:37:50.563]  Well, really, I don't think I've ever seen an article or a news piece where they had someone on against it.
[00:37:51.383 --> 00:37:55.084]  They've probably given the Verichip Company more coverage than any other company I've ever heard of.
[00:37:55.344 --> 00:37:57.024]  They're on TV on a weekly basis.
[00:37:57.104 --> 00:37:57.524]  Everywhere.
[00:37:57.604 --> 00:37:58.105]  Every show.
[00:37:58.165 --> 00:37:58.745]  Every channel.
[00:37:59.345 --> 00:38:00.565]  I don't even watch much TV.
[00:38:00.605 --> 00:38:01.105]  I turn it on.
[00:38:01.125 --> 00:38:01.986]  They're on television.
[00:38:02.726 --> 00:38:04.086]  They're all over the newspapers.
[00:38:04.346 --> 00:38:05.066]  How great it is.
[00:38:05.106 --> 00:38:05.687]  How good it is.
[00:38:05.947 --> 00:38:07.127]  It's just like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:38:09.331 --> 00:38:10.191]  95% of the coverage.
[00:38:10.291 --> 00:38:11.092]  I mean, more than that.
[00:38:11.432 --> 00:38:12.672]  It's all been positive.
[00:38:13.593 --> 00:38:21.358]  This Jones woman, this Morgenthaler Jones up on all the channels, how great it is, everybody's for it, let's do it for Arnold.
[00:38:21.378 --> 00:38:23.799]  80 plus percent in polls are against it.
[00:38:26.607 --> 00:38:31.471]  But the media acts like everyone's for it, and it doesn't have any other voice.
[00:38:32.091 --> 00:38:34.113]  Old print media, L.A.
[00:38:34.173 --> 00:38:45.101]  Times and Associated Press and Australian newspapers, they've picked up what we're doing, and we've now gotten more visitors in a week than they got in their first two weeks.
[00:38:45.721 --> 00:38:50.085]  So our website, ArnoldExposed.com, that we just redesigned yesterday, by the way, check it out.
[00:38:51.005 --> 00:38:51.906]  It's beautiful.
[00:38:51.926 --> 00:38:54.448]  I want to thank those that helped us with it.
[00:38:56.371 --> 00:38:59.713]  Yeah, it got redesigned a week into its, you know, after its birth.
[00:39:01.414 --> 00:39:02.595]  ArnoldExposed.com.
[00:39:04.776 --> 00:39:07.037]  We're getting more visitors than they are.
[00:39:08.078 --> 00:39:09.219]  They say they got 4 million.
[00:39:09.239 --> 00:39:11.040]  Well, by then we'd had upwards of 4 million.
[00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:15.262]  Now I haven't even checked it since last Wednesday.
[00:39:18.044 --> 00:39:21.746]  So the grassroots, we've got more visitors just with alternative media.
[00:39:22.532 --> 00:39:25.399]  But still, wall-to-wall positive coverage.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:26.521]  Oh, it's so good.
[00:39:26.602 --> 00:39:27.403]  Arnold for president.
[00:39:27.524 --> 00:39:28.766]  Oh, yes, he'd be so good.
[00:39:29.147 --> 00:39:30.150]  Oh, he's so wonderful.
[00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:31.453]  Oh, it's just unstoppable.
[00:39:33.988 --> 00:39:39.013]  Meanwhile, the average public that I talk to are in the same mode they were in six years ago over microchips.
[00:39:39.033 --> 00:39:40.174]  Hey, here's the federal plan.
[00:39:41.114 --> 00:39:42.696]  A direct link to the Army website.
[00:39:42.736 --> 00:39:54.786]  Look, look, it says they're going to push it as a fad and as security and for prisoners and old people, and they're going to start promoting it, and they say that they can use the media to mold public opinion, and this is their plan.
[00:39:55.007 --> 00:39:56.208]  Look, it's the Army website.
[00:39:56.248 --> 00:39:58.069]  Please, please, please spread the word.
[00:39:58.169 --> 00:39:59.150]  Oh, shut up, kook.
[00:39:59.170 --> 00:39:59.891]  That'll never happen.
[00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:03.812]  Now I tell you Arnold's going to be your next president.
[00:40:04.192 --> 00:40:05.473]  Oh, that'll never happen.
[00:40:05.493 --> 00:40:06.394]  That's crazy.
[00:40:06.434 --> 00:40:07.274]  Nobody's for that.
[00:40:07.534 --> 00:40:07.935]  Oh, really?
[00:40:07.955 --> 00:40:09.136]  Have you watched TV lately?
[00:40:11.697 --> 00:40:18.482]  And if the yuppies see 20 reports saying Arnold should be our president and how great it is, they'll suddenly go, well, I'm for it then!
[00:40:19.563 --> 00:40:25.488]  People who say they'd never be for it and they hate the idea will suddenly shift mentally because they always want to be on the winning side.
[00:40:25.788 --> 00:40:26.468]  Okay, I'm for it.
[00:40:26.488 --> 00:40:26.949]  I'm all for it.
[00:40:26.969 --> 00:40:27.329]  I don't care.
[00:40:28.436 --> 00:40:34.100]  Because if I just say I'm for it psychologically, I don't have to face being defeated in something, so I'll just go along with it.
[00:40:35.241 --> 00:40:37.062]  You know, if you can't beat them, join them.
[00:40:44.767 --> 00:40:52.252]  And the article goes on how great the chips are and how wonderful it's going to be.
[00:40:56.227 --> 00:41:05.470]  And this guy says, we need basic protection similar to what's already in place for other technologies, ranging from home phone lines to financial records, which are already totally public.
[00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.011]  I'd humbly suggest federal laws covering five points.
[00:41:09.531 --> 00:41:13.472]  Getting an implantable ID chip should always be voluntary without coercion.
[00:41:14.152 --> 00:41:21.014]  Well, you better read the press releases of Applied Digital then, and read the transcript and listen to the audio of their European distributor.
[00:41:22.802 --> 00:41:28.068]  Where they're going to make troops take it, where they're going to make prisoners take it, make old people take it.
[00:41:30.610 --> 00:41:37.017]  They made the Mexican judicial workers, whatever the real number is, take them, or no job.
[00:41:39.219 --> 00:41:43.424]  So see, out of the gates, they're already trying to make it mandatory.
[00:41:48.450 --> 00:41:53.433]  What's more, schools, businesses, and government should be banned from offers that pressure people.
[00:41:54.333 --> 00:42:01.557]  Prisoners, for example, couldn't be promised time off their sentences, and insurance carriers couldn't offer lower rates.
[00:42:02.497 --> 00:42:09.281]  There has to be an off switch implanted, and chips must have the capability either to be permanently turned off or to be removed.
[00:42:10.001 --> 00:42:11.742]  Now, these things migrate, by the way, folks.
[00:42:12.062 --> 00:42:16.805]  The very chip can't be deactivated, but can be removed in a minor outpatient procedure.
[00:42:17.882 --> 00:42:19.144]  Scanners can't be hidden.
[00:42:19.164 --> 00:42:22.348]  Scanners that read implanted ID chips can't be built into walls.
[00:42:22.729 --> 00:42:26.915]  The grocery stores have already built them in to read the RFIDs with the smart shelving.
[00:42:27.535 --> 00:42:29.018]  Individuals must be in control.
[00:42:29.098 --> 00:42:34.285]  Chip recipients need full disclosure and absolute veto power over what information goes on the computer database.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:40.165]  Well, the number just accesses the huge databases that are already running wild.
[00:42:40.565 --> 00:42:50.756]  Law enforcement agencies would need to convince a judge of their legitimate interest in looking at your ID database in the same way they need court orders to look at your phone or bank records.
[00:42:52.058 --> 00:42:55.702]  Well, under the Patriot Act, they're already throwing all that out the window.
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:58.541]  So see, y'all, this is reasonable.
[00:42:58.661 --> 00:42:59.922]  It's very good.
[00:43:00.522 --> 00:43:06.787]  Again, every week I see articles in big papers, and they're always positive, never negative.
[00:43:06.867 --> 00:43:08.428]  I've never seen one negative.
[00:43:08.768 --> 00:43:10.129]  It's just all good.
[00:43:12.210 --> 00:43:13.531]  You ought to contact Knight Ritter.
[00:43:13.991 --> 00:43:23.998]  You ought to contact all these Associated Press and Reuters and the Washington Post and go, can't you just do one story saying chips aren't good?
[00:43:25.515 --> 00:43:27.256]  Can't you just do one story?
[00:43:32.718 --> 00:43:33.818]  So, here we are.
[00:43:33.838 --> 00:43:36.699]  Wall to wall, open borders are good.
[00:43:37.359 --> 00:43:39.620]  Wall to wall, implantable chips under your skin are good.
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:42.861]  Wall to wall, face scanning cameras going up everywhere is good.
[00:43:43.902 --> 00:43:46.283]  Just wall to wall, Arnold will be your next president.
[00:43:46.343 --> 00:43:47.303]  Good, good, good, good, good.
[00:43:48.884 --> 00:43:49.824]  None of us are for it.
[00:43:49.904 --> 00:43:50.984]  It's totally insane.
[00:43:51.345 --> 00:43:52.685]  It's out of control, big brother.
[00:43:53.766 --> 00:43:54.846]  But notice he spins it
[00:43:55.447 --> 00:44:06.011]  This Mike Landsberg, he spins it and says, you know, we just need the chip, nothing Big Brother-ish, no need to go down the slippery slope to Big Brother.
[00:44:06.711 --> 00:44:12.913]  No, you're off the slippery slope falling into the bottom of the gorge when you've got people openly saying, let's take chips.
[00:44:16.354 --> 00:44:24.377]  No one ever thought it'd be mandatory, but after terrorists nuked Chicago, the president went forward with a plan to ID chip every American.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:32.464]  They're moving to do this because we've got to have in our Pan-American Union free flow at the borders.
[00:44:33.284 --> 00:44:34.705]  It's part of our treaty obligations.
[00:44:35.485 --> 00:44:37.006]  It's what makes our economy strong.
[00:44:38.227 --> 00:44:42.890]  Because of this, you all will have transponders in your cars tracking and tracing you for your safety.
[00:44:43.531 --> 00:44:45.312]  And, yes, you all must take a chip.
[00:44:47.113 --> 00:44:48.754]  And you're going to hear those words.
[00:44:49.494 --> 00:44:51.956]  And you're going to hear neocons scream.
[00:44:53.715 --> 00:44:56.838]  Scream that you're aiding terrorists when you say no.
[00:44:57.199 --> 00:45:01.723]  And then the government will carry out terror attacks, smaller ones.
[00:45:03.225 --> 00:45:06.809]  They'll probably go after facilities that manufacture the chips.
[00:45:08.350 --> 00:45:10.612]  And, of course, that's in communist China as the main plan.
[00:45:10.652 --> 00:45:15.838]  But I'm just giving you hypothetical projections on what they normally do in the long-term plan I see unfolding.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.860]  And unfortunately, you're probably going to see all this happen.
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:26.542]  The globalists will carry out terror attacks against themselves and then blame it on some imaginary Christian group who's fighting the chips.
[00:45:29.422 --> 00:45:41.464]  And, you know, the Christian group will probably take kids hostage at a school and they'll blow the school up and it'll really be special forces that run out the back of the school and then they'll grab some mental patient and go, here's the leader of the Christian group.
[00:45:41.884 --> 00:45:42.744]  He did it all.
[00:45:43.005 --> 00:45:45.445]  And they'll go, the group murdered children.
[00:45:46.169 --> 00:45:47.590]  The group bombed.
[00:45:48.271 --> 00:45:52.414]  And then anyone who's against the chip, they must be with them, the terrorists.
[00:45:52.434 --> 00:45:59.018]  And you'll hear the Christian leaders going, the chip is not the mark of the beast, it is the good mark, showing you're not with the beast.
[00:45:59.479 --> 00:46:02.701]  They'll have Al-Qaeda leaders in tapes going, don't take the chips, Americans.
[00:46:02.721 --> 00:46:05.903]  And people will go, my gosh, Al-Qaeda's against the chip.
[00:46:05.943 --> 00:46:09.766]  The chip, give me the chip, give it to me, I'm tired of the nukes going off.
[00:46:10.246 --> 00:46:11.387]  Oh, please.
[00:46:11.407 --> 00:46:14.129]  You think I'm joking?
[00:46:16.078 --> 00:46:20.082]  Folks, I can see their whole plan as clear as a road map laid out on a breakfast table.
[00:46:24.486 --> 00:46:25.788]  I know how they operate.
[00:46:27.089 --> 00:46:34.536]  A thousand, ten thousand different points of information integrated into how they operate, what they do, what the Pentagon has said they're going to do.
[00:46:35.718 --> 00:46:37.019]  And it's going to be the same for everything.
[00:46:37.560 --> 00:46:41.441]  You'll have terror groups that are against gun control that carry out terror attacks.
[00:46:41.741 --> 00:46:45.382]  Oh, then if you're a gun rights group, you're all secretly terrorists who've got to arrest you.
[00:46:45.762 --> 00:46:50.364]  You'll have homeschooler groups that go out and blow up schools and kill everybody.
[00:46:50.624 --> 00:46:51.884]  Of course, it will really be globalist.
[00:46:52.364 --> 00:46:59.266]  They're already doing the drills coast to coast that homeschoolers are going to slaughter and kill everybody and we're all really terrorists and we've got to be arrested too.
[00:47:02.027 --> 00:47:02.887]  You think I'm joking?
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:07.501]  I'm not trying to scare you.
[00:47:08.722 --> 00:47:09.822]  I'm about to go to your calls.
[00:47:11.323 --> 00:47:13.745]  This is how everything's going to be terrorized.
[00:47:13.785 --> 00:47:14.765]  The whole economy.
[00:47:15.305 --> 00:47:18.207]  And see, a lot of people are going to go along with this because that's the only job you'll be able to get.
[00:47:18.648 --> 00:47:22.950]  Most of the colleges shifting over to their base curriculum, being homely and security.
[00:47:23.370 --> 00:47:24.811]  That's going to be the new jobs.
[00:47:25.011 --> 00:47:29.234]  Checkpoints, surveillance, tattletailing, all misdemeanors are terrorism.
[00:47:34.136 --> 00:47:40.822]  To graduate from high school, you'll have to watch 10 to 20 hours a week from your home computer surveillance cameras in another city.
[00:47:41.402 --> 00:47:47.167]  You'll have to report illegal or suspicious activity like clutching a bag or a man and woman arguing.
[00:47:47.708 --> 00:47:48.829]  Then you face scan them.
[00:47:49.149 --> 00:47:50.350]  This is the New York Times, by the way.
[00:47:51.651 --> 00:47:52.652]  They'll have the high schoolers.
[00:47:52.952 --> 00:47:56.115]  They'll hit the button, get authorization, hit the code key.
[00:47:56.956 --> 00:47:59.198]  The camera will be fed through a face scanning database.
[00:47:59.458 --> 00:48:00.359]  They'll get the names.
[00:48:00.599 --> 00:48:01.660]  They'll red flag it.
[00:48:02.597 --> 00:48:12.480]  Get an access code, and then there'll be a Citizen Corps, Secure Corps liaison in the emergency management compound of the city.
[00:48:12.520 --> 00:48:15.661]  But it says you'll always be in another city watching another city.
[00:48:16.321 --> 00:48:18.582]  That way you don't ever watch your own family or folks you know.
[00:48:18.602 --> 00:48:20.803]  This is even, again, New York Times, how great this is.
[00:48:21.243 --> 00:48:24.124]  And then a board of several people will be there 24 hours a day.
[00:48:24.324 --> 00:48:28.165]  They'll look at your flag and decide whether to go arrest them or not.
[00:48:33.308 --> 00:48:34.328]  I mean, I'm not joking.
[00:48:34.368 --> 00:48:35.169]  This was the plan.
[00:48:38.350 --> 00:48:38.970]  I'm sorry.
[00:48:40.110 --> 00:48:40.690]  I'm sorry.
[00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:43.191]  And the Christian leaders are all going to be behind it.
[00:48:43.211 --> 00:48:44.331]  The liberals will all be behind it.
[00:48:44.351 --> 00:48:45.212]  They'll all be behind it.
[00:48:50.953 --> 00:48:52.254]  Let me just plug my videos now.
[00:48:52.274 --> 00:48:56.675]  When we come back, I'll go to John and Margaret and Aaron and Kevin and everybody else.
[00:48:58.075 --> 00:49:00.136]  You know, I don't really belabor this like I should.
[00:49:01.038 --> 00:49:11.762]  Because my videos are really a big part of the solution in waking people up because they're fast-moving, they're totally documented, they're well-produced, professionally produced, you know, up to standards people expect.
[00:49:13.222 --> 00:49:14.683]  So many Patriot videos are not.
[00:49:15.803 --> 00:49:16.744]  I've made 11 of them.
[00:49:16.784 --> 00:49:20.205]  The newest is American Dictators, documenting the stage of the election of 2004.
[00:49:20.625 --> 00:49:26.367]  It shows how Bush and Kerry have the exact same policies, how they're cousins, the latest 9-11 information.
[00:49:27.207 --> 00:49:28.688]  We go back to Bohemian Grove.
[00:49:30.695 --> 00:49:32.896]  It's $19.95 for one copy.
[00:49:32.956 --> 00:49:36.037]  Each additional copy to give as gifts, $5.95.
[00:49:37.037 --> 00:49:38.998]  So buy four or five copies and give them as gifts.
[00:49:40.219 --> 00:49:41.319]  Or just make copies of them.
[00:49:41.339 --> 00:49:42.960]  But it's a nicer gift to give them an original.
[00:49:43.420 --> 00:49:44.420]  You're authorized to make copies.

[00:50:59.358 --> 00:51:00.119]  Your call's coming up.
[00:51:01.545 --> 00:51:08.392]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.692 --> 00:51:10.074]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:10.274 --> 00:51:12.476]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.636 --> 00:51:14.718]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.999 --> 00:51:19.944]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:20.264 --> 00:51:24.308]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.528 --> 00:51:26.310]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:37.038]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and findable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:37.178 --> 00:51:39.080]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[00:52:05.185 --> 00:52:10.629]  These self-sterilizing filters can transform raw pond and lake water into delicious crystal clear drinking water.
[00:52:10.909 --> 00:52:21.276]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:21.436 --> 00:52:25.779]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:25.959 --> 00:52:34.305]  Trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:52:34.585 --> 00:52:40.910]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.

[00:54:10.082 --> 00:54:11.542]  All right, let's go to your calls.
[00:54:17.541 --> 00:54:18.942]  Let's talk to John in Texas.
[00:54:19.022 --> 00:54:19.843]  John, you're on the air.
[00:54:19.883 --> 00:54:20.223]  Welcome.
[00:54:20.743 --> 00:54:21.124]  Hi, Alex.
[00:54:22.785 --> 00:54:23.165]  How you doing?
[00:54:23.365 --> 00:54:23.585]  Good.
[00:54:24.686 --> 00:54:26.687]  I can understand why people can't see all this.
[00:54:26.768 --> 00:54:27.708]  It's right out in the open.
[00:54:27.748 --> 00:54:29.429]  All they have to do is sit down and do the math.
[00:54:30.570 --> 00:54:32.331]  I mean, look at this stupid war.
[00:54:32.391 --> 00:54:36.815]  I mean, supposedly we got attacked by Saudi nationals and one Egyptian.
[00:54:37.415 --> 00:54:39.596]  They supposedly attacked the World Trade Center.
[00:54:39.636 --> 00:54:40.377]  They turned around.
[00:54:40.397 --> 00:54:42.779]  They attacked Iraq, which had nothing to do with it.
[00:54:42.859 --> 00:54:44.520]  They said he had weapons of mass destruction.
[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:45.180]  Then they found out.
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:45.761]  Then they say, well...
[00:54:47.728 --> 00:54:48.688]  It was a lie, I guess.
[00:54:49.769 --> 00:54:55.931]  And now they're saying that Iran has them, and trust us this time, we're sure they have them.
[00:54:55.951 --> 00:55:12.077]  Then after that they say, well, he was an evil dictator, he tortures people, we had to take them out, yet we entire whole economy to red China, which Amnesty International figures said that they murdered 65, between 65 million and 100 million people, they murdered 6 million people in Tibet.
[00:55:12.577 --> 00:55:15.958]  They were the main backers of the Khmer Rouge, so you know they had to hand that massacre there.
[00:55:16.570 --> 00:55:17.591]  Yet they're our good buddies.
[00:55:17.991 --> 00:55:18.731]  Saddam was evil.
[00:55:18.771 --> 00:55:19.752]  We had to go take him out.
[00:55:19.912 --> 00:55:21.633]  It just don't make sense.
[00:55:21.813 --> 00:55:28.236]  And then once the globalists are in the country, they start massively torturing, hiring all Saddam's former people.
[00:55:28.716 --> 00:55:30.277]  I know, but it doesn't matter.
[00:55:30.297 --> 00:55:31.378]  It's all emotion.
[00:55:32.702 --> 00:55:32.922]  It is.
[00:55:32.962 --> 00:55:35.324]  When you talk to these neocons, it's all emotion.
[00:55:35.504 --> 00:55:42.207]  I mean, have you heard them call into the shows and go, nuke them, kill every one of them, kill every one in Iraq, kill them, kill them?
[00:55:42.327 --> 00:55:45.829]  What they want to do is do what Hitler did when he occupied Europe.
[00:55:45.889 --> 00:55:48.611]  If somebody shot at German troops, they went in there and wiped out the whole village.
[00:55:48.631 --> 00:55:50.352]  That's basically what we're stooping down to.
[00:55:51.513 --> 00:55:52.593]  And it's not going to work?
[00:55:53.233 --> 00:55:55.975]  No, it won't work for the Germans, it won't work for us.
[00:55:56.015 --> 00:55:57.596]  The resistance will spread even more, so...
[00:55:59.332 --> 00:56:02.935]  And the people that our troops are fighting are the people that were fighting Saddam.
[00:56:03.816 --> 00:56:04.216]  That's right.
[00:56:04.577 --> 00:56:12.103]  But every time they have, you know, some former Al-Qaeda person who supposedly they've killed twice and captured three times, some new tape gets released going, I'll get you.
[00:56:12.483 --> 00:56:13.684]  I'm behind all of it.
[00:56:13.704 --> 00:56:15.306]  So we can go, see, it's Al-Qaeda.
[00:56:15.326 --> 00:56:16.346]  They're behind it all.
[00:56:16.627 --> 00:56:17.567]  Thanks for the call, John.
[00:56:18.808 --> 00:56:19.589]  Very good points.
[00:56:21.631 --> 00:56:22.652]  Margaret in Illinois.
[00:56:22.732 --> 00:56:23.352]  Thanks for holding.
[00:56:23.372 --> 00:56:23.813]  Go ahead.
[00:56:24.173 --> 00:56:24.553]  Hello?
[00:56:24.914 --> 00:56:25.174]  Yes.
[00:56:25.794 --> 00:56:27.636]  Alex, I'm having problems.
[00:56:28.446 --> 00:56:33.028]  Getting on your website and some of the articles that you click on, they're not there.
[00:56:34.149 --> 00:56:35.830]  Have you had any reports about that?
[00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:41.873]  Well, I mean, there's so much on our site that links go bad because sites change their links.
[00:56:42.433 --> 00:56:43.714]  We've got dead links on the site.
[00:56:43.734 --> 00:56:46.035]  Nobody's perfect, even the biggest newspapers do.
[00:56:46.075 --> 00:56:48.556]  But you say you're having trouble getting on the site.
[00:56:49.036 --> 00:56:53.378]  Yeah, I'm having trouble downloading some of the articles.
[00:56:54.539 --> 00:56:56.680]  You have there, click on to certain things.
[00:56:57.250 --> 00:57:05.135]  Like your archives and the things on, like one of them was on masonry, one of them was on skull and bones, and it's dead.
[00:57:06.036 --> 00:57:07.897]  Yeah, I'm not there with you, so I'm sorry.
[00:57:07.957 --> 00:57:10.019]  I don't have the specifics.
[00:57:10.219 --> 00:57:11.220]  I can't really help you.
[00:57:11.900 --> 00:57:15.262]  Send an email to tips at infowars.com.
[00:57:15.323 --> 00:57:18.685]  You know how to copy the link that's dead and ask them to fix it.
[00:57:19.886 --> 00:57:20.366]  Okay.
[00:57:20.386 --> 00:57:22.828]  Okay.
[00:57:22.848 --> 00:57:23.128]  Okay.
[00:57:24.952 --> 00:57:25.752]  All right, is that it?
[00:57:26.152 --> 00:57:26.973]  Yeah, that's it.
[00:57:27.153 --> 00:57:29.073]  Thank you for trying to visit the website.
[00:57:29.953 --> 00:57:32.194]  Let's talk to Aaron in Michigan.
[00:57:32.254 --> 00:57:33.054]  Aaron, you're on the air.
[00:57:33.074 --> 00:57:34.415]  Hello?
[00:57:34.775 --> 00:57:35.035]  Yes.
[00:57:35.795 --> 00:57:37.135]  Hello, thank you for taking my call.
[00:57:38.356 --> 00:57:44.658]  I just want to call to let you know I've been hosting the Americans Against Arnold press release all around the message boards I visit.
[00:57:45.138 --> 00:57:45.918]  Oh, good, thank you.
[00:57:46.278 --> 00:57:53.100]  And I emailed some news agencies and our local news up here, and it's been getting a pretty good response.
[00:57:53.871 --> 00:57:55.872]  But the majority of people are all running.
[00:57:56.412 --> 00:57:59.354]  There are a few that are still wanting to run.
[00:58:00.534 --> 00:58:03.076]  Now, again, in a national poll, it was 80%.
[00:58:03.116 --> 00:58:04.416]  In some polls, it's even higher.
[00:58:04.436 --> 00:58:07.278]  I would imagine, is this a college message board?
[00:58:09.139 --> 00:58:09.359]  No.
[00:58:09.839 --> 00:58:12.140]  It's just a community message board.
[00:58:14.962 --> 00:58:17.823]  Like a game message board and other stuff.
[00:58:18.483 --> 00:58:19.504]  Yeah.
[00:58:19.724 --> 00:58:21.165]  So a video game message board.
[00:58:21.205 --> 00:58:23.426]  I'd imagine that's younger males.
[00:58:24.662 --> 00:58:32.088]  Yeah, and also, I subscribed to PrisonPlanet.tv and downloaded some of your videos.
[00:58:32.548 --> 00:58:33.269]  Pretty interesting.
[00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:35.010]  Well, I appreciate you doing that.
[00:58:35.050 --> 00:58:35.851]  We need your support.
[00:58:36.191 --> 00:58:37.833]  Anything else you want to add, Aaron?
[00:58:38.553 --> 00:58:38.893]  Oh, yes.
[00:58:38.953 --> 00:58:40.014]  This past summer.
[00:58:40.274 --> 00:58:40.735]  I'll tell you what.
[00:58:40.775 --> 00:58:41.155]  Stay there.
[00:58:41.215 --> 00:58:45.238]  We'll come back to you in the next hour, and then to Kevin and Steve and everybody else.
[00:58:45.859 --> 00:58:47.220]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:58:47.901 --> 00:58:48.881]  Second hour straight ahead.
[00:58:58.174 --> 00:58:58.834]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.495 --> 00:59:00.556]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.256 --> 00:59:02.357]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.017 --> 00:59:03.878]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.598 --> 00:59:05.539]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:06.179 --> 00:59:10.082]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.342 --> 00:59:14.525]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.745 --> 00:59:16.566]  All right, my friends.
[00:59:16.586 --> 00:59:18.007]  The 30th day of November, 2004.
[00:59:18.627 --> 00:59:21.509]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:59:21.549 --> 00:59:25.912]  Now into the second hour of this worldwide transmission against tyranny.
[00:59:27.463 --> 00:59:31.644]  The toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:32.725 --> 00:59:35.446]  Justices, stay out of debate over gays.
[00:59:35.906 --> 00:59:39.507]  High Court won't rule on same-sex nuptials.
[00:59:39.587 --> 00:59:41.087]  We'll be covering that.
[00:59:41.187 --> 00:59:45.749]  We'll also get into federal plan to keep data on students worrisome.
[00:59:46.469 --> 00:59:50.871]  More on mainstream news, saying how we all need to get the microchip, how great it is.
[00:59:51.271 --> 00:59:55.272]  The head of Central Command calls for Internet controls to stop evil Al-Qaeda.
[00:59:56.181 --> 00:59:57.222]  Prisoner refuses.
[00:59:58.223 --> 00:59:59.344]  Pensioner refuses.
[00:59:59.384 --> 01:00:00.645]  Yeah, they're a prisoner to their pension.
[01:00:01.085 --> 01:00:03.967]  Refuses PIN number and is told to bank elsewhere.
[01:00:05.288 --> 01:00:08.931]  Also, Bush nominates Cuban-born Gutierrez to Commerce Department.
[01:00:09.412 --> 01:00:11.954]  Dollar firms on intervention prospects.
[01:00:12.434 --> 01:00:16.717]  By firming, it went up a few points of a cent.
[01:00:17.478 --> 01:00:19.199]  And just a lot more coming up.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:22.402]  Plus some police state legislation I want to cover.
[01:00:23.007 --> 01:00:24.948]  But right now, we're talking to Aaron in Michigan.
[01:00:24.968 --> 01:00:27.050]  Aaron, finish up what you were saying last hour?
[01:00:27.070 --> 01:00:37.097]  Yeah, well, this summer, we got a new traffic light put in the city, near the city where I live, and on top of that, there's a camera there now I just noticed.
[01:00:37.117 --> 01:00:39.439]  I thought that was pretty interesting.
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:44.883]  And a state trooper that we know, we had to drive him into town one day, and he noticed it.
[01:00:45.583 --> 01:00:47.465]  He was wondering what that's there for.
[01:00:47.905 --> 01:00:48.405]  He said it doesn't...
[01:00:49.744 --> 01:00:51.529]  Going to the state police post.
[01:00:51.850 --> 01:00:53.053]  She's wondering why he's there.
[01:00:53.962 --> 01:01:03.525]  Well, I don't know about Michigan, but I've been all over different areas of the country, and at tiny four-way stops in one-horse towns, there'll be four cameras.
[01:01:04.105 --> 01:01:15.469]  I mean, I haven't seen a small town in Texas that isn't just lined with blisters of cameras, and it admittedly is hooked into Homeland Security, which they told us it was for traffic, but it's not for traffic.
[01:01:15.489 --> 01:01:16.549]  I mean, that's a dual use.
[01:01:17.389 --> 01:01:23.131]  It's for face scanning and license plate scanning, and it's going to be used for an automatic toll road collection system.
[01:01:25.385 --> 01:01:29.186]  So we'll use the toll roads to pay for it, and then they'll track and trace us.
[01:01:30.546 --> 01:01:34.787]  Well, listen, you said you were visiting prisonplanet.tv and downloading the videos.
[01:01:34.807 --> 01:01:35.208]  That's good.
[01:01:35.648 --> 01:01:39.689]  Yeah, my dad and I watched some of them, and it's pretty amazing stuff.
[01:01:39.729 --> 01:01:45.170]  And I'm going to be buying some of your videos, and I'm going to buy a DVD burner and burn them and copy them and give them to people.
[01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:49.451]  A lot of people are doing what you're doing, Aaron, and it's having a giant effect.
[01:01:49.471 --> 01:01:50.511]  God bless and keep it up.
[01:01:51.232 --> 01:01:52.053]  Well, one more question.
[01:01:52.293 --> 01:01:52.513]  Sure.
[01:01:52.653 --> 01:01:58.816]  I was wondering if you received my package I sent you with Senator John McCain on the Sanctuary of Jay Leno video.
[01:01:59.237 --> 01:01:59.957]  I dubbed that for you.
[01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:01.318]  Yes, I did get it.
[01:02:01.378 --> 01:02:01.638]  Thank you.
[01:02:01.658 --> 01:02:01.818]  Okay.
[01:02:01.998 --> 01:02:03.179]  I just wanted you guys to make sure.
[01:02:03.479 --> 01:02:05.840]  Yeah, how great it will be to have Arnold as our fuhrer.
[01:02:06.061 --> 01:02:06.281]  Yeah.
[01:02:07.281 --> 01:02:08.302]  Thanks for sending it, Aaron.
[01:02:10.123 --> 01:02:12.964]  Kevin in Boston, Mass.
[01:02:13.005 --> 01:02:13.725]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[01:02:14.486 --> 01:02:15.607]  Hi, thanks for taking my call.
[01:02:15.627 --> 01:02:16.288]  Thank you for calling.
[01:02:16.328 --> 01:02:16.588]  Go ahead.
[01:02:16.608 --> 01:02:25.915]  I was listening to this radio on the way into work this morning on NPR, the local Boston version of it, not the national one, and they had a talk show.
[01:02:25.955 --> 01:02:30.899]  The topic was local media personality Robin Young was very nice, saying election myth.
[01:02:31.260 --> 01:02:32.341]  It started on November 3rd.
[01:02:33.231 --> 01:02:38.892]  Emails from listeners raised questions about voter fraud in the presidential election, insisting that the election was stolen.
[01:02:39.332 --> 01:02:45.834]  We talked to two reporters who have done the research and say there was no wide-scale voting fraud, so everyone can rest assured there.
[01:02:46.574 --> 01:02:54.375]  Karen Timmelty of Time Magazine and Mark Zirkelis of the Boston Globe are there to assure us that there was no fraud.
[01:02:54.435 --> 01:02:56.356]  I think maybe they should have had Bev Harris on the show.
[01:02:56.696 --> 01:02:57.556]  Well, it's like...
[01:03:01.408 --> 01:03:15.051]  This weekend there was an AP article in the local paper here in Austin that said people are baffled why the exit polls didn't match the actual votes, why they're trying to find out how they messed up.
[01:03:15.711 --> 01:03:20.892]  You know, there's no discussion of was there election fraud in Ohio, and clearly there was.
[01:03:21.212 --> 01:03:22.952]  And again, folks, I'm not for carry.
[01:03:23.272 --> 01:03:24.592]  I'm just reporting the facts.
[01:03:24.692 --> 01:03:25.392]  I've looked at it.
[01:03:25.812 --> 01:03:29.533]  Clearly, you know, there's a recount going in the state right now
[01:03:30.293 --> 01:03:39.942]  Well, the good news about this past election, what it showed to me, this staged election, was that there's a great and powerful awakening and unity growing in our country.
[01:03:40.002 --> 01:03:42.605]  People can say yes to basic things.
[01:03:42.645 --> 01:03:43.626]  I'm for the Constitution.
[01:03:43.646 --> 01:03:44.506]  I'm for the Bill of Rights.
[01:03:44.707 --> 01:03:46.308]  I'm for a real border with Mexico.
[01:03:46.428 --> 01:03:47.409]  Family, God, country.
[01:03:47.770 --> 01:03:49.831]  Sounds like liberal extremism, Kevin.
[01:03:49.851 --> 01:03:50.392]  Stay there.
[01:03:50.412 --> 01:03:51.233]  We'll talk about it more.
[01:03:53.562 --> 01:03:57.909]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:58.089 --> 01:04:02.536]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.676 --> 01:04:07.042]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:07.082 --> 01:04:08.444]  The New World Order.
[01:04:10.207 --> 01:04:14.451]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.491 --> 01:04:21.439]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.559 --> 01:04:23.642]  You will lose your liberties.
[01:04:23.942 --> 01:04:34.385]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.545 --> 01:04:39.946]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[01:04:54.682 --> 01:04:55.724]  The war on terrorism.
[01:04:56.024 --> 01:04:58.828]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[01:04:59.088 --> 01:05:03.254]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[01:05:03.674 --> 01:05:04.495]  So what do you do?
[01:05:04.816 --> 01:05:09.402]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[01:05:09.882 --> 01:05:12.003]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[01:05:12.484 --> 01:05:27.193]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:05:27.233 --> 01:05:34.297]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[01:05:53.573 --> 01:05:55.054]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:05:55.275 --> 01:06:02.621]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:06:02.921 --> 01:06:07.345]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:06:07.605 --> 01:06:17.434]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:06:17.814 --> 01:06:19.855]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read
[01:06:46.442 --> 01:06:47.783]  Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:06:47.923 --> 01:06:48.903]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:06:54.786 --> 01:07:00.828]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:01.429 --> 01:07:04.470]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.911 --> 01:07:07.771]  All right, going straight back to your calls.
[01:07:08.452 --> 01:07:10.493]  Kevin in Boston, go ahead and finish up, sir.
[01:07:11.053 --> 01:07:15.935]  Well, that's, you know, you were pointing out yesterday that gold is going up
[01:07:16.483 --> 01:07:22.347]  And that the stock market, you know, yuppies will be happy because it will appear the stock market's going up because they're measured in shrinking dollars.
[01:07:22.788 --> 01:07:30.293]  In actuality, I took a look when you said that, and I did a five-year chart for both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and for gold.
[01:07:30.933 --> 01:07:35.977]  From right before Bush took office, if you'll recall, the stock market was up, the Dow Jones, up around 11,000.
[01:07:36.097 --> 01:07:37.958]  That Dow Jones today is 10,466.
[01:07:38.198 --> 01:07:39.219]  It's actually down 5%.
[01:07:39.259 --> 01:07:39.659]  Gold's up 51%.
[01:07:43.561 --> 01:07:45.162]  Still just through the roof more than that.
[01:07:45.462 --> 01:07:49.443]  There's things you can do, folks, to get ready, and you've got to take action, get involved.
[01:07:50.864 --> 01:07:54.265]  And then they have reports like, ooh, the dollar strengthened yesterday.
[01:07:54.285 --> 01:07:58.126]  Yeah, a couple of percentage points.
[01:08:00.849 --> 01:08:02.491]  You know, it's been doing that for two years.
[01:08:02.551 --> 01:08:10.197]  It'll go down ten points, then go back up a point, then go down three points, then go back up two points, then go down five points, then go back up a point.
[01:08:10.577 --> 01:08:13.019]  All measured in dollars that are becoming worthless.
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:15.701]  Well, yeah, the stock market... It's down.
[01:08:16.162 --> 01:08:26.530]  It takes more of those devalued dollars to buy that stock market, and so it inflates the price of those stocks, and it's a total and complete illusion.
[01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:27.131]  Thanks for the call.
[01:08:27.151 --> 01:08:27.491]  Thank you.
[01:08:28.746 --> 01:08:30.427]  And it's just simple math, folks.
[01:08:31.727 --> 01:08:36.569]  But yuppies only know how to measure their wealth by stock market values, so they don't understand.
[01:08:37.469 --> 01:08:48.793]  But even with it taking 45% more dollars to buy that same stock, because the value's been brought down, still the stock market is down from what it was three and a half years ago.
[01:08:50.074 --> 01:08:52.635]  Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in California.
[01:08:52.695 --> 01:08:53.395]  Steve, go ahead.
[01:08:54.184 --> 01:08:56.005]  Hi Alex, greetings from Humboldt County.
[01:08:56.265 --> 01:09:00.247]  I got to tell you a lot of people love what you're doing up here and keep up the good work.
[01:09:02.227 --> 01:09:07.189]  I'm talking about today at least a couple things at the local level as far as law making goes.
[01:09:07.630 --> 01:09:16.753]  I live in Arcata, California and there's at least two laws here on the books allowing for the protection of individuals' rights.
[01:09:17.314 --> 01:09:17.654]  One of them
[01:09:19.119 --> 01:09:30.123]  Well, there are some zoning laws that have been erected locally to stop Walmarts and others moving in, and in some cases that's a good thing, but also then it can become too intrusive
[01:09:48.147 --> 01:09:56.150]  And hurt local businesses, but I'm all for protecting the infrastructure of small towns that, by and large, are just disappearing.
[01:09:56.690 --> 01:10:07.934]  Well, and the director for the movie, the corporation, actually came to speak at Humboldt State University in Arcata because the city was used as a subject topic in the movie.
[01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:16.797]  What I should also say, though, is there's also a law in the books here in Arcata where if there's a tip pertaining to homeland security and a threat to that,
[01:10:17.393 --> 01:10:22.297]  The city council actually calls an emergency meeting and makes a decision whether law enforcement should act on that.
[01:10:22.377 --> 01:10:23.078]  Yeah, I saw that.
[01:10:23.158 --> 01:10:29.263]  Instead of, oh, I saw people arguing on the side of the road, let's call a SWAT team, which is what the federal guidelines say.
[01:10:29.803 --> 01:10:37.690]  Instead, if the feds are going to be involved, they have to get authorization from the city and the county, which is what the Constitution says, folks.
[01:10:38.658 --> 01:10:46.022]  Of course, the globalists will just carry out attacks and say, laws like this and laws against the Patriot Act let the terrorists attack you.
[01:10:46.382 --> 01:10:48.804]  You didn't pass the National ID card fast enough.
[01:10:48.864 --> 01:10:49.824]  It's your fault.
[01:10:50.424 --> 01:10:52.546]  Now you better learn to give all your rights up.
[01:10:53.026 --> 01:10:57.448]  And I've heard neocons giggle on the radio and go, wait till there's another attack.
[01:10:57.808 --> 01:11:00.190]  We're going to put people in re-education centers.
[01:11:00.430 --> 01:11:02.431]  You guys are all going to learn real soon.
[01:11:03.177 --> 01:11:08.042]  Well, it appears that a lot of the local politicians, the council members, are very supportive of this law.
[01:11:08.062 --> 01:11:14.468]  I don't think that they felt extorted by their voting public or, you know, were forced into this in any way.
[01:11:14.488 --> 01:11:17.431]  And I don't really think they're being viewed as crazy liberals.
[01:11:19.002 --> 01:11:21.184]  No, I think it's wonderful what's happening.
[01:11:21.204 --> 01:11:26.669]  You've got a coalition of what you'd call liberals and then real conservatives that are against this global system.
[01:11:26.709 --> 01:11:38.138]  I mean, when you go to a protest against globalism, now you see a bunch of what you'd call kind of retro hippies out protesting the UN and the IMF and the World Bank and the World Trade Organization.
[01:11:38.759 --> 01:11:41.101]  Where are the conservatives out protesting that?
[01:11:41.341 --> 01:11:47.046]  I mean, the liberals, the grassroots ones, not the John Kerry types, have figured out that globalism isn't a good thing.
[01:11:47.546 --> 01:12:00.936]  Well, and I think despite the fact that this legislation could easily be overturned at the state or federal level, it still is extremely important to set these type of precedents whenever possible, and this community has done that.
[01:12:02.125 --> 01:12:08.490]  Also with the non-GMO legislation that's in Mendocino County, the next county south of here, that's very important.
[01:12:08.970 --> 01:12:22.300]  The people involved in that are essentially national stars that they don't know that they are until they're finally talking to other radio talk show hosts or traveling, and they say, wow, I heard about non-genetically modified organisms.
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:25.702]  In the newspaper, and it was all centered out of Mendocino County.
[01:12:25.742 --> 01:12:29.284]  I can't believe that you people were able to turn around such a giant corporation like that.
[01:12:29.304 --> 01:12:31.125]  No, absolutely, absolutely.
[01:12:31.145 --> 01:12:36.528]  And then having areas where they can't distribute really causes a major problem, thanks to the call.
[01:12:37.849 --> 01:12:40.710]  And that's the type of law I totally agree with.
[01:12:41.251 --> 01:12:47.974]  In fact, was it about six months ago, I even had one of their city council members on about this, and it's simple.
[01:12:50.196 --> 01:12:50.476]  Big...
[01:12:51.678 --> 01:13:00.740]  Biotech says, oh, we've been breeding plants together for higher yield and better fruits and vegetables for thousands of years.
[01:13:01.360 --> 01:13:06.041]  Well, yeah, people have been crossing one tomato with another tomato or one type of corn with another corn.
[01:13:06.582 --> 01:13:09.302]  That's been going on for hundreds and thousands of years.
[01:13:10.923 --> 01:13:21.085]  But putting cockroach genes that are now in most tomatoes, the cockroach gene makes it last longer, putting salmon genes in most of the corn...
[01:13:21.849 --> 01:13:24.232]  Putting human genes in a lot of the foods you eat?
[01:13:24.693 --> 01:13:27.176]  That's totally legal, and of course it shouldn't be.
[01:13:28.818 --> 01:13:39.350]  The Terminator genes, where the plant can't produce its own seeds, then they open air plant these plants, it jumps into other species of plants, and other subspecies of the same...
[01:13:40.735 --> 01:13:44.177]  A variety, and then suddenly that plant can't produce seeds.
[01:13:44.237 --> 01:13:49.720]  So it's like spreading like a cancer, killing the reproductive systems of plants.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.841]  That should be totally illegal.
[01:13:51.881 --> 01:13:54.543]  I mean, these are literally bioweapons.
[01:13:55.943 --> 01:14:02.587]  Imagine a headline, Al-Qaeda creates a bioweapon that makes it to where plants can't reproduce.
[01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:06.969]  I mean, imagine.
[01:14:07.049 --> 01:14:15.955]  But Monsanto and others do it, and it's just... So the city said, look, you can't sell these genetically engineered foods in our city.
[01:14:17.956 --> 01:14:21.139]  I mean, I know everybody hates the French, and they shouldn't.
[01:14:21.159 --> 01:14:28.584]  I mean, I don't like some of the things they do, but bottom line, they pass laws against genetically modified foods, and it's helped their farmers and their public.
[01:14:30.185 --> 01:14:32.066]  I mean, remember Starlink corn?
[01:14:33.186 --> 01:14:37.929]  That got into Taco Bell shells and the rest of it admittedly caused all sorts of health problems?
[01:14:41.491 --> 01:14:48.236]  And the neocons always used examples of, well, a decade ago they said a spray used on apples was bad and that was a fraud.
[01:14:48.496 --> 01:14:49.817]  That was a scare tactic.
[01:14:50.757 --> 01:14:54.940]  Well, because one thing was a scare tactic, does that mean everything else is good for you?
[01:14:58.102 --> 01:14:59.803]  I've got a USA Today article here.
[01:15:00.734 --> 01:15:10.827]  Where the FDA, Food and Drug Administration, went to the medical journals that had done the test on Vioxx that causes major heart problems.
[01:15:12.109 --> 01:15:16.535]  They've hence had to restrict five other drugs that have that base molecule in their manufacture.
[01:15:17.634 --> 01:15:19.154]  And they went to him and said, cover this up.
[01:15:19.174 --> 01:15:20.435]  I mean, that's what the FDA does.
[01:15:20.455 --> 01:15:27.537]  And we've got their memos from 2000 that Congressman Dan Burton got a hold of where they say, man, I wouldn't give this to my grandchildren.
[01:15:27.577 --> 01:15:28.637]  This stuff's deadly.
[01:15:28.697 --> 01:15:30.078]  Brain damage is incredible.
[01:15:30.458 --> 01:15:31.758]  We've got to cover this up.
[01:15:32.378 --> 01:15:33.879]  Concerning mercury in the vaccines.
[01:15:33.919 --> 01:15:36.320]  And now the FDA comes out and goes, we've done a study.
[01:15:36.360 --> 01:15:38.280]  Mercury's actually good for you.
[01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:41.301]  Good points.
[01:15:42.362 --> 01:15:43.802]  Let's talk to Dr. Deagle.
[01:15:44.859 --> 01:15:46.800]  Who we've had on as a guest before, Dr. Deagle calling in.
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:47.741]  What's going on, Dr. Deagle?
[01:15:49.062 --> 01:15:49.642]  Hi, Alex.
[01:15:50.503 --> 01:15:51.864]  This is a pretty important topic.
[01:15:54.245 --> 01:16:02.831]  I sent an article in last night that I've been working on for a while to try to compile it with lots of informational links called Chipping Away at Liberty.
[01:16:03.271 --> 01:16:06.173]  And I hope, of course, it was pretty late by the time I finished it.
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:11.801]  Well, you sent it to Paul Watson?
[01:16:12.161 --> 01:16:12.821]  I sent it to Paul.
[01:16:12.841 --> 01:16:15.622]  I also sent a copy to your producer, Violet.
[01:16:15.682 --> 01:16:17.663]  Yeah, we've posted your stories before, Dr. Dingell.
[01:16:17.703 --> 01:16:18.403]  We'll get it posted.
[01:16:18.723 --> 01:16:18.903]  Yeah.
[01:16:19.143 --> 01:16:19.863]  Thanks for doing that.
[01:16:20.724 --> 01:16:21.484]  What's on your mind?
[01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:24.685]  Well, you cover all the important topics.
[01:16:25.005 --> 01:16:32.868]  The mercury in the vaccines, the 36 bioweapon laboratories in the United States to give us so many vaccines, it's going to totally overwhelm our immune systems.
[01:16:35.474 --> 01:16:43.800]  The National ID is the most pressing thing, which looks like they're going to try to do, I call it a, well, this movie is out now called National Treasure.
[01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:48.283]  They're going to try to shove this thing, I think, before or just right after Christmas.
[01:16:48.323 --> 01:16:51.065]  The National ID is the thing that really gives me nightmares.
[01:16:52.946 --> 01:16:55.068]  It's not just an ID that they want to give you an ID.
[01:16:55.228 --> 01:16:58.230]  By the way, England's trying to pass it right now, too.
[01:16:58.951 --> 01:17:05.375]  And again, they admit it's to have a job, all the data on you in it, it is to track and trace and control you.
[01:17:05.975 --> 01:17:11.579]  I've actually seen a version of the national ID that was approved by Lockheed Martin and the military five years ago.
[01:17:12.379 --> 01:17:18.182]  Not only that, also I saw the encapsulated in titanium or Pyrex injectable chips and the injector.
[01:17:19.243 --> 01:17:20.804]  And it's already sitting in a warehouse waiting.
[01:17:20.964 --> 01:17:23.986]  And again, for those that just joined us, Dr. Deagle is a medical...
[01:17:25.024 --> 01:17:34.189]  A doctor who's worked in homeland security and broke a lot of major revelations on this broadcast, and it's always good to have you call in.
[01:17:34.789 --> 01:17:38.291]  What do you think about all the other news we've been covering?
[01:17:38.771 --> 01:17:41.132]  Well, it's all so overwhelming.
[01:17:41.152 --> 01:17:42.633]  There's so many things happening.
[01:17:44.474 --> 01:17:49.777]  Last year, they tried about a year and a half ago to force all the physicians in the country to take the polio vaccine until...
[01:17:50.379 --> 01:17:57.066]  A bunch of doctors started researching and finding out that if they had any silent heart disease, if they took the polio vaccine, they died of a heart attack within a day or two.
[01:17:58.448 --> 01:17:59.969]  It's the same kinds of things going on.
[01:17:59.989 --> 01:18:12.983]  We've calculated out two years ago that if they gave the polio vaccine to all American citizens because they thought it was going to be released as a bioweapon, it would kill about 7,000 Americans just from the known death rate from the vaccine.
[01:18:14.671 --> 01:18:17.232]  And that's just the reported cases.
[01:18:17.412 --> 01:18:19.212]  That's just the reported ones that we calculate.
[01:18:19.252 --> 01:18:21.573]  We don't even know about other things that could happen.
[01:18:22.933 --> 01:18:25.894]  There's so many things going on now, it's just unbelievable.
[01:18:27.475 --> 01:18:30.636]  Well, what's the article you sent to us about, about the microchips?
[01:18:30.696 --> 01:18:42.039]  It's all about everything from not just the microchip, which is the national ID, which has all the data, but also their plan is to eventually wet wire all the military implants in their brains, their cortex,
[01:18:42.688 --> 01:18:43.089]  Oh, I know.
[01:18:43.109 --> 01:18:44.411]  That's the Pentagon plan from 2000.
[01:18:44.471 --> 01:18:49.278]  Well, Dr. Eagle, let me get the article to get you up as a guest, okay?
[01:18:49.778 --> 01:18:50.219]  Sounds great.
[01:18:50.379 --> 01:18:51.020]  Good to hear from you.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:51.421]  We'll be back.
[01:18:53.763 --> 01:18:56.786]  You and your family members getting enough minerals in the daily diet?
[01:18:57.166 --> 01:18:59.668]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:18:59.908 --> 01:19:06.975]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:19:07.175 --> 01:19:10.438]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[01:19:10.698 --> 01:19:12.740]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:20.887]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:19:21.067 --> 01:19:21.747]  We're good to go.
[01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:57.275]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:19:57.675 --> 01:20:03.102]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:20:03.563 --> 01:20:04.664]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:20:04.704 --> 01:20:08.730]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:20:09.370 --> 01:20:22.673]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Rule in 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:20:23.173 --> 01:20:28.474]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:20:28.774 --> 01:20:34.675]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.
[01:20:35.316 --> 01:20:35.376]  1-800-686-2237

[01:21:52.702 --> 01:21:56.083]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[01:21:56.323 --> 01:21:56.644]  Why?
[01:21:56.664 --> 01:21:59.605]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?

[01:22:57.668 --> 01:22:59.248]  This show is documented.
[01:22:59.709 --> 01:23:02.450]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:06.452]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:23:06.833 --> 01:23:10.995]  I went down, down, down, and the flames went higher.
[01:23:11.455 --> 01:23:15.577]  And it burns, burns, burns, the ring of fire.
[01:23:15.737 --> 01:23:20.200]  All right, James and Richard and Mike and Linda, everybody else, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:23.802]  I want to go ahead and get into some more of the news.
[01:23:25.102 --> 01:23:25.923]  Here's an article.
[01:23:27.910 --> 01:23:43.262]  Concerning California, Laguna Hills Department, and it says violation, parking violation, and the primary language it's in, this is in California, is Spanish.
[01:23:46.224 --> 01:23:49.327]  And the person that got this, you know, is going to pay the parking ticket.
[01:23:49.347 --> 01:23:50.888]  They're not disputing that.
[01:23:51.489 --> 01:23:56.973]  They're just shocked that the primary language, or what comes first...
[01:23:57.726 --> 01:23:58.587]  Is Spanish.
[01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:13.575]  And make no mistake, the government is doing everything they can to make sure that people coming to this country, the 30 million Latin Americans that are already here, to make sure that they do not assimilate.
[01:24:13.615 --> 01:24:14.875]  They want to balkanize.
[01:24:14.895 --> 01:24:15.996]  They want divisions.
[01:24:16.036 --> 01:24:20.258]  They want kind of a Tower of Babel type system.
[01:24:21.959 --> 01:24:26.902]  I had mentioned earlier that USA...
[01:24:27.816 --> 01:24:29.659]  Today article.
[01:24:32.803 --> 01:24:33.504]  Listen to this.
[01:24:34.706 --> 01:24:42.076]  Scientists say FDA pulled journal to block Vioxx article.
[01:24:44.582 --> 01:25:07.456]  Just days before a medical journal was to publish a Food and Drug Administration-sponsored study that raised concerns about the safety of the arthritis drug Vioxx, an FDA official took the unusual step, it's not unusual, of calling the editor to raise questions about the findings scientific integrity suggests email obtained by USA Today.
[01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:12.019]  Now, you see, the journal let this slip out.
[01:25:13.004 --> 01:25:13.944]  Normally they don't.
[01:25:14.064 --> 01:25:17.686]  I mean, there are thousands of studies saying mercury's deadly to the brain.
[01:25:19.786 --> 01:25:22.267]  And they don't publicize and really push those.
[01:25:22.287 --> 01:25:27.729]  You know, they push the new study the FDA paid for saying it is actually good for your child's brain, and mercury's good for you.
[01:25:27.749 --> 01:25:31.050]  Of course, that's not true.
[01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:32.531]  Everybody knows it's deadly poison.
[01:25:33.231 --> 01:25:34.231]  But, you know, so what?
[01:25:34.271 --> 01:25:35.111]  They say it's nutritious.
[01:25:36.432 --> 01:25:42.394]  Lead author David Graham says the call was part of an effort to block publication of his research
[01:25:44.002 --> 01:26:02.630]  An analysis of a database of 1.4 million Kaiser members showing that those who took Vioxx were more likely to suffer a heart attack or sudden cardiac death than those who took Celebrex, Vioxx's rival.
[01:26:04.289 --> 01:26:09.312]  Graham had reported his study in August at an epidemiology meeting in France.
[01:26:09.712 --> 01:26:13.114]  A publication in a medical journal would have exposed it to a wider audience.
[01:26:13.414 --> 01:26:16.196]  So again, you notice he exposed it in France.
[01:26:16.876 --> 01:26:18.117]  I mean, it's like that with everything.
[01:26:18.177 --> 01:26:30.864]  I've probably seen, well, let's be conservative, 400, I mean, there are sites that have 1,000 reports, but I've literally read over hundreds of these over the years, about sodium fluoride.
[01:26:32.757 --> 01:26:41.745]  Not to mention the stuff that's in the sodium fluoride, the byproducts of the manufacture of aluminum, the purification of aluminum, or the manufacture of fertilizers.
[01:26:42.005 --> 01:26:43.606]  That's where these byproducts come from.
[01:26:43.986 --> 01:26:46.268]  And they just leave all the other chemicals in there as well.
[01:26:46.749 --> 01:26:47.930]  That's been in major journals.
[01:26:49.011 --> 01:26:56.657]  We're talking heavy metals, Grignard reagents, all these horrible things that, I mean, will kill you.
[01:26:56.737 --> 01:26:57.958]  But it's in there.
[01:26:59.239 --> 01:27:01.441]  And they don't care.
[01:27:03.582 --> 01:27:06.824]  I mean, literally, folks, there are so many studies on sodium fluoride.
[01:27:07.084 --> 01:27:14.947]  I mean, I've got studies from the 1930s at the University of Texas about, man, this is an incredible toxic sedative.
[01:27:14.967 --> 01:27:20.730]  It causes bone fractures and cell death in the brain.
[01:27:20.770 --> 01:27:31.095]  And it's true, the Nazis actually used it in the water supply at a little bit higher levels than is in our water as a sedative at their work centers.
[01:27:32.255 --> 01:27:33.136]  You know them as camps.
[01:27:37.003 --> 01:27:37.984]  And so it's the same thing.
[01:27:38.024 --> 01:27:43.887]  I mean, these studies are all out there, but it's just like this top scientist who did an FDA study, by the way.
[01:27:44.327 --> 01:27:47.049]  He's telling people in France about it, but you never hear about it.
[01:27:47.109 --> 01:27:49.830]  It took the medical journal, and this slipped out.
[01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:50.891]  This was going to be blocked.
[01:27:53.012 --> 01:27:56.194]  I'm trying to get lead author Dr. David Graham on.
[01:27:58.143 --> 01:28:14.530]  Graham's Associate Director of Science and Medicine at the FDA's Office of Drug Safety, says the Lancet, a medical journal published in London, had planned to post the study on the website November 17th, the day in advance of his appearance before the Senate Finance Committee to testify about FDA's handling of Vioxx.
[01:28:15.551 --> 01:28:19.693]  Merck had pulled the drug from the market September 30th because of safety concerns.
[01:28:19.733 --> 01:28:22.274]  Publication of the study could have embarrassed the FDA.
[01:28:22.955 --> 01:28:23.515]  We're on the march.
[01:28:23.575 --> 01:28:24.716]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:25.317 --> 01:28:27.939]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.658 --> 01:28:54.158]  Hey, psst.
[01:28:54.638 --> 01:29:00.200]  JLS Research, founders of a revolutionary new all-natural deodorant, wants to get up close and personal with you.
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:01.480]  You use deodorant, right?
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:02.581]  Well, let's hope you do.
[01:29:02.761 --> 01:29:05.361]  You obviously wear it to cover up embarrassing underarm odor.
[01:29:05.582 --> 01:29:10.443]  Well, why mask the odor when you can completely eliminate the bacteria which causes the odor in the first place?
[01:29:10.683 --> 01:29:11.663]  Check out this new product.
[01:29:11.843 --> 01:29:14.824]  It's called NoVO, and you won't believe how effectively it works.
[01:29:15.145 --> 01:29:19.106]  I know, you're wondering how can you trust NoVO to eliminate your embarrassing body odor.
[01:29:19.306 --> 01:29:22.287]  Look, the creator of NoVO understands what you're going through.
[01:29:22.447 --> 01:29:28.189]  That's why she had to search 40 years to find this all-natural product that actually soothes the skin while it attacks bacteria.
[01:29:28.389 --> 01:29:29.749]  Now, she wants to share it with you.
[01:29:30.049 --> 01:29:30.850]  Still not convinced?
[01:29:31.090 --> 01:29:31.430]  Try it.
[01:29:31.570 --> 01:29:32.810]  Go ahead, try NoVO.
[01:29:32.930 --> 01:29:33.771]  It comes with a 100% money-back offer.
[01:29:35.171 --> 01:29:35.852]  We're good to go.
[01:29:53.897 --> 01:29:55.518]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.658 --> 01:29:59.801]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:29:59.901 --> 01:30:02.782]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:02.842 --> 01:30:09.566]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:09.747 --> 01:30:12.768]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:12.969 --> 01:30:15.350]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.490 --> 01:30:23.635]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as after
[01:30:23.715 --> 01:30:25.616]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:30:54.138 --> 01:30:58.782]  Hi, I'd like to welcome Alan Glass, who is a pharmacist from Marks Plaza Pharmacy in Vancouver, Canada.
[01:30:58.883 --> 01:30:59.283]  Hi, Alan.
[01:30:59.303 --> 01:31:00.124]  Welcome to the program.
[01:31:00.304 --> 01:31:00.864]  Thank you, Marvin.
[01:31:01.065 --> 01:31:04.428]  Now, I understand that prescription drugs are far less expensive in Canada.
[01:31:04.588 --> 01:31:05.109]  Is that true?
[01:31:05.349 --> 01:31:06.330]  Yes, Marvin, it's true.
[01:31:06.370 --> 01:31:09.353]  You can save 40% or more off the regular U.S.
[01:31:09.393 --> 01:31:09.673]  prices.
[01:31:09.853 --> 01:31:11.914]  What about drugs like Premarin and Lipitor?
[01:31:11.934 --> 01:31:12.715]  They're very common.
[01:31:12.795 --> 01:31:15.997]  Those common drugs you can save 50% off the regular U.S.
[01:31:16.017 --> 01:31:16.277]  price.
[01:31:16.557 --> 01:31:17.718]  Now what about Tamoxifen?
[01:31:17.758 --> 01:31:20.139]  I understand you can save 70% on Tamoxifen.
[01:31:20.359 --> 01:31:24.162]  Tamoxifen, you can see a 75% savings against the regular U.S.
[01:31:24.182 --> 01:31:24.462]  price.
[01:31:24.842 --> 01:31:27.243]  Now are these brand-name products made by the same companies?
[01:31:27.523 --> 01:31:29.505]  Yes, the same multinational U.S.
[01:31:29.545 --> 01:31:31.626]  corporation makes them in Canada and the U.S.
[01:31:31.846 --> 01:31:36.749]  So to save money on prescription drugs in Canada, call the toll-free number for your information package.
[01:31:37.009 --> 01:31:40.872]  To find out more, call toll-free 1-800-840-0686.
[01:31:42.553 --> 01:31:43.573]  That's 1-800-840-0686.

[01:31:55.081 --> 01:32:00.244]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:00.904 --> 01:32:03.226]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:32:13.287 --> 01:32:14.708]  All right, your calls are coming up.
[01:32:15.008 --> 01:32:23.253]  This USA Today article continues where the FDA told their chief scientist over the investigation, don't publish that information.
[01:32:24.354 --> 01:32:30.858]  Steve Gelson, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said Sunday that Graham's charges were unfounded.
[01:32:31.474 --> 01:32:34.835]  We didn't make any efforts to block the publication in the Lancet Journal.
[01:32:35.156 --> 01:32:42.939]  He said, what we did do is let the Lancet know that the paper was submitted in violation of the agency's clearance process.
[01:32:46.060 --> 01:32:48.521]  So isn't that just darling?
[01:32:48.541 --> 01:32:50.021]  I mean, that's total doublespeak.
[01:32:52.402 --> 01:32:54.443]  By the way, this is just local CBS.
[01:32:54.983 --> 01:32:56.404]  This aired all over the country.
[01:32:56.444 --> 01:32:58.625]  They had specials on all these big shows.
[01:33:00.305 --> 01:33:03.567]  60 Minutes, Oprah Winfrey, they just care so much about you.
[01:33:04.148 --> 01:33:08.552]  Letting you know about mercury actually being nutritious.
[01:33:09.292 --> 01:33:11.794]  Good for brain development and helping behavior.
[01:33:12.415 --> 01:33:15.978]  I guess your child won't misbehave if, let's say, you remove their brain entirely.
[01:33:17.093 --> 01:33:18.433]  I guess that's the line of thinking.
[01:33:18.453 --> 01:33:23.095]  So here's that clip off the local news, and since it's been all over television everywhere.
[01:33:23.755 --> 01:33:25.875]  Mercury, part of your nutritious daily breakfast.
[01:33:25.895 --> 01:33:26.235]  Here it is.
[01:33:26.695 --> 01:33:29.136]  Mercury-containing vaccines may have on kids.
[01:33:29.376 --> 01:33:32.717]  A life-saving device wins over-the-counter approval by the FDA.
[01:33:32.997 --> 01:33:37.798]  And sick of your glasses and contact lenses, a new corrective eye surgery is approved today.
[01:33:37.818 --> 01:33:41.239]  Here's tonight's medical headlines with medical watch reporter Seema Mathur.
[01:33:43.695 --> 01:33:43.975]  Okay, so...
[01:34:13.618 --> 01:34:14.679]  Just there you have it.
[01:34:14.940 --> 01:34:22.067]  And notice all the hundreds and hundreds of modern studies, thousands of studies on Mercury, period.
[01:34:22.108 --> 01:34:23.889]  I mean, Mercury is one of the most studied things ever.
[01:34:25.932 --> 01:34:30.837]  Those are called concerns, not all the other scientific evidence shows it's deadly poison.
[01:34:30.877 --> 01:34:34.041]  And if you ingest even small amounts, it causes major illnesses.
[01:34:35.542 --> 01:34:36.223]  No mention of that.
[01:34:36.263 --> 01:34:41.306]  Just, there have been some concerns, but those have been ruled out by the new study.
[01:34:41.806 --> 01:34:44.007]  Several new studies paid for by the FDA.
[01:34:44.067 --> 01:34:47.089]  It may actually help your child, Mercury.
[01:34:48.109 --> 01:34:48.570]  Good.
[01:34:49.330 --> 01:34:50.451]  I mean, come on, folks.
[01:34:51.671 --> 01:34:53.012]  Microchips are good for you.
[01:34:53.072 --> 01:34:53.913]  Mercury is good.
[01:34:54.033 --> 01:34:55.434]  Arnold for President is good.
[01:34:57.015 --> 01:34:58.175]  You like NAFTA and GATT?
[01:34:58.195 --> 01:34:59.916]  That was certainly good for the economy, wasn't it?
[01:34:59.936 --> 01:35:02.338]  Well, you're going to love the free trade area of the Americas.
[01:35:02.418 --> 01:35:02.798]  It's just...
[01:35:04.739 --> 01:35:05.380]  It's incredible.
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:09.724]  French vaccine fuels hopes in AIDS treatment.
[01:35:10.404 --> 01:35:12.546]  Preliminary study shows promise.
[01:35:13.707 --> 01:35:15.409]  This is out of the San Francisco Chronicle.
[01:35:16.770 --> 01:35:19.092]  There's talk of making you take the AIDS vaccine.
[01:35:19.693 --> 01:35:22.135]  AIDS itself is a government-engineered bioweapon.
[01:35:22.395 --> 01:35:23.196]  That's now public.
[01:35:23.757 --> 01:35:30.143]  French researchers reported Sunday that an AIDS vaccine designed to treat the disease rather than prevent it has...
[01:35:30.999 --> 01:35:37.943]  Scored an initial success by suppressing the virus from up to a year among a small group of patients who tried it.
[01:35:39.443 --> 01:35:55.352]  Although the technique is cumbersome and costly, the experiment published in an online version of the British Medical Nature Medicine is being touted as the first determination of an efficient therapeutic vaccine against the autoimmune deficiency syndrome.
[01:35:56.072 --> 01:35:59.894]  Federal plan to keep data on students worries some.
[01:36:00.912 --> 01:36:01.721]  Worrisome!
[01:36:02.859 --> 01:36:22.783]  A proposal by the federal government to create a vast new database of enrollment records, admittedly for the draft, on all college university students is raising concerns that the move will erode the privacy rights of students until now universities have provided initial individual student information to the federal government only in connection with federally financed student aid.
[01:36:23.343 --> 01:36:32.585]  Otherwise, colleges and universities submit information about overall enrollment, graduation prices, and financial aid without identifying particular students.
[01:36:33.601 --> 01:36:43.948]  For the first time, however, colleges and universities will have to give the government all data on students individually, whether or not they received financial assistance with their Social Security numbers.
[01:36:47.170 --> 01:36:52.514]  Oh boy, and they're also, it says, doing it in elementary and high schools and in post-secondary education.
[01:36:59.959 --> 01:37:01.140]  There's just no end to it.
[01:37:04.042 --> 01:37:07.467]  Abizide, if I'm pronouncing that right, calls for Internet controls.
[01:37:07.887 --> 01:37:08.448]  A top U.S.
[01:37:08.468 --> 01:37:21.265]  general called out last Friday for bolder international action to stop the spread of Muslim extremism, suggesting curbs were needed to prevent the Internet and other media from being used by groups like Al-Qaeda.
[01:37:23.061 --> 01:37:29.506]  Why is it that people have the right to get on the Internet and spread this hatred and insanity without there being some curb?
[01:37:29.907 --> 01:37:33.670]  Some law, said General John Abizid, the chief of the U.S.
[01:37:33.710 --> 01:37:34.430]  Central Command.
[01:37:34.690 --> 01:37:50.383]  To me, if we think this is some kind of freedom of speech to put a picture of someone getting their head chopped off on the Internet and people have the right to purvey that, that's not the world I want to live in, and it just encourages this kind of behavior, he said.
[01:37:51.323 --> 01:38:12.934]  Funny, almost all these uploads of people getting their heads chopped off, many of them are obviously fake, top forensic heads of universities have looked at it and said that, they're grabbed by the FBI, handed over to Al-Shiaida, Nick Berg, 15 Iraqi security force guys show up that openly work for our government, grab the head of CARE International, go blow her head off, and then, oh, Al-Qaeda!
[01:38:13.434 --> 01:38:15.415]  Al-Zawahiri's taking credit again!
[01:38:15.435 --> 01:38:19.817]  A CIA press release from CIA officer Al-Zawahiri.
[01:38:20.745 --> 01:38:21.725]  I mean, all these people.
[01:38:24.387 --> 01:38:27.928]  And they upload these head-chopping videos.
[01:38:28.408 --> 01:38:29.589]  It's always from some U.S.
[01:38:29.629 --> 01:38:31.650]  government site or some neocon site.
[01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:33.991]  And that's their pretext.
[01:38:34.031 --> 01:38:35.591]  We've got to regulate and control the net.
[01:38:35.611 --> 01:38:37.192]  We've got to shut it down and dominate it.
[01:38:38.092 --> 01:38:39.773]  And all of that's part of Internet, too.
[01:38:39.833 --> 01:38:42.174]  And the general, he's involved in this now.
[01:38:43.135 --> 01:38:46.476]  Well, we've got to regulate the net because we've got to stop the Muslim extremists.
[01:38:49.309 --> 01:38:52.530]  Pensioner refuses PIN number and is told to bank elsewhere.
[01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:54.851]  This is out of the Herald.
[01:38:55.571 --> 01:39:04.114]  A Lytton man who has held a bank account with HSBC since his first birthday has been told that he should take his business elsewhere.
[01:39:04.714 --> 01:39:16.438]  Philip Rawson, 69, has been told that because he does not want to use cards with a personal identification number, the HBSC will no longer be able to offer accounts to him.
[01:39:17.378 --> 01:39:25.267]  Mr. Rawson and his family have been connected to the bank, formerly the Midland, for generations.
[01:39:25.327 --> 01:39:26.949]  Both his mother and father worked for the bank.
[01:39:27.329 --> 01:39:35.478]  His grandfather was a manager of the branch, even received commemorative coins for holding a bank account with the company for 60 years.
[01:39:38.504 --> 01:39:42.105]  Mr. Rawson said he was completely flummoxed by the decision taken by the bank.
[01:39:42.646 --> 01:39:51.169]  He added that all he wanted to do was return to using a checkbook with a check guarantee card, which is why he returned his pen to the bank.
[01:39:52.330 --> 01:40:04.414]  Carolyn Mooney, spokeswoman for HSBC, told the Herald, the introduction of the chip and pen is very much to protect the client and the bank from fraudulent activity.
[01:40:07.756 --> 01:40:08.196]  Oh boy.
[01:40:10.865 --> 01:40:13.506]  So, there you have it.
[01:40:13.947 --> 01:40:17.589]  Bush nominates Cuban-born Gutierrez to commerce.
[01:40:19.510 --> 01:40:21.311]  And this guy's got a lot of shady connections.
[01:40:21.351 --> 01:40:27.134]  And again, I don't care if the whole cabinet is Hispanic, if they were pro-freedom.
[01:40:27.974 --> 01:40:30.155]  This guy's got a lot of problems in his past.
[01:40:30.616 --> 01:40:36.839]  Nothing compared, though, to Alberto, I love torture, Gonzalez, the architect of the Abu Ghraib torture manuals.
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:40.343]  The architect of Patriot Act II subsections.
[01:40:40.903 --> 01:40:42.825]  The architect of saying Bush is above the law.
[01:40:43.886 --> 01:40:52.814]  President Bush nominated Kellogg Company CEO Carlos Gutierrez Monday as his next Commerce Secretary.
[01:40:56.057 --> 01:40:58.480]  Dollar firms on intervention prospects.
[01:40:59.221 --> 01:41:10.407]  The dollar firmed against major currencies coming off of all-time lows against the euro as analysts reckoned on European monetary authorities intervening on markets to help shore up the U.S.
[01:41:11.047 --> 01:41:11.268]  unit.
[01:41:11.848 --> 01:41:13.709]  The problem is it's only a stopgap measure.
[01:41:14.089 --> 01:41:17.191]  The single European currency eased to $1.3255.
[01:41:18.952 --> 01:41:21.373]  So, less than half a cent.
[01:41:21.393 --> 01:41:23.714]  Boy, it's really been firmed up.
[01:41:26.356 --> 01:41:28.457]  Again, the single European currency eased to...
[01:41:30.115 --> 01:41:35.999]  $1.3255 in early European trading from $1.3289.
[01:41:37.099 --> 01:41:46.606]  So, that's just, what, 25 pennies?
[01:41:47.487 --> 01:41:49.488]  No, no, excuse me, I was reading that wrong.
[01:41:50.309 --> 01:41:50.889]  I'm sorry.
[01:41:52.130 --> 01:41:58.034]  That's about four pennies.
[01:41:58.094 --> 01:41:59.035]  I'm sorry, I was reading it wrong.
[01:41:59.522 --> 01:42:01.443]  I need a calculator here.
[01:42:01.904 --> 01:42:01.443]  $1.3255.
[01:42:02.584 --> 01:42:09.268]  It fell to that from $1.3289 in late trading.
[01:42:10.049 --> 01:42:12.030]  Boy, that is your positive news there.
[01:42:15.312 --> 01:42:17.774]  It just gets crazier and crazier, people.
[01:42:20.636 --> 01:42:23.918]  It's dropped by 40-something cents and it goes up a few pennies.
[01:42:25.159 --> 01:42:28.401]  It hasn't even erased losses of last week and they call it a
[01:42:29.915 --> 01:42:30.956]  Everything's fine.
[01:42:31.016 --> 01:42:32.136]  Everything will go back to sleep.
[01:42:32.496 --> 01:42:35.378]  Big Brother TV show to make EU super state cool.
[01:42:36.738 --> 01:42:56.868]  Constituents in the next series of the Spanish Big Brother series, or microchip, by the way, in last year's series, earlier this year's series, excuse me, have been set the unbelievable task of memorizing the 325-page EU constitutional treaty and then explaining it to a Polish woman.
[01:42:57.941 --> 01:43:03.505]  And a show more used to naked lawn mowing and secret transsexuals.
[01:43:03.545 --> 01:43:12.151]  The next series is intended to raise awareness on the new treaty, popularize politics, and take some of the junk out of reality TV.
[01:43:13.552 --> 01:43:24.460]  The move has been backed by Spain's socialist government, which has a very small budget for publishing the contents of the Constitution before the country becomes the first to hold a referendum on it in February.
[01:43:24.780 --> 01:43:26.461]  So they're going to have a nice PR piece about
[01:43:27.168 --> 01:43:27.849]  How great it is.
[01:43:29.851 --> 01:43:31.733]  One episode is how to be a transsexual.
[01:43:31.773 --> 01:43:34.676]  Next episode is how to get a microchip to be the coolest person.
[01:43:35.197 --> 01:43:37.619]  Next episode is how to worship your EU.
[01:43:38.900 --> 01:43:40.022]  Go to call in just a second.
[01:43:41.123 --> 01:43:42.945]  This is out of Reuters.
[01:43:43.565 --> 01:43:45.648]  Hospital in Germany treats 21,000 GIs.
[01:43:45.748 --> 01:43:46.308]  One hospital.
[01:43:50.436 --> 01:43:56.177]  About 21,000 Americans, most of them from units sent to Iraq, have been treated at the biggest U.S.
[01:43:56.197 --> 01:44:03.019]  military hospital outside the United States since the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in late 2001, the hospital said Monday.
[01:44:04.899 --> 01:44:08.540]  The Landstahl Regional Medical Center in Germany handles many U.S.
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:16.742]  combat casualties, but it did not break down the figure into battle and non-combat parameters.
[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:21.061]  Landstall doctors treated 17,878 U.S.
[01:44:21.942 --> 01:44:26.505]  soldiers from Iraq and 3,085 from Afghanistan through Sunday.
[01:44:26.565 --> 01:44:36.771]  Hospital spokeswoman Marie Shaw told the AP the patients were treated for anything from gunshot wounds to non-combat ailments such as kidney stones.
[01:44:41.114 --> 01:44:41.574]  Oh, boy.
[01:44:42.509 --> 01:44:44.770]  Very, very, very serious.
[01:44:45.231 --> 01:44:48.713]  Experts call for New World Body to fight global terrorism.
[01:44:49.193 --> 01:44:50.193]  CNS News.
[01:44:51.274 --> 01:44:51.954]  Jerusalem.
[01:44:52.495 --> 01:44:59.078]  Democratic countries need to band together to form an international league of states dedicated to the worldwide fight against terrorism.
[01:44:59.739 --> 01:45:02.961]  Given the United Nations' failure to do so, experts in Jerusalem said.
[01:45:02.981 --> 01:45:07.243]  So we have your fake right-wing and your fake left-wing world government.
[01:45:08.832 --> 01:45:11.413]  Group to file war crimes sued against the U.S.
[01:45:11.473 --> 01:45:13.594]  over Abu Ghraib abuse in German courts.
[01:45:15.375 --> 01:45:16.695]  I'll get more into this later.
[01:45:17.235 --> 01:45:24.038]  Believe me, I've got this legislation where if you have a gun illegally, life in prison.
[01:45:24.538 --> 01:45:26.359]  Just to give you an idea of what they're trying to pass.
[01:45:27.379 --> 01:45:28.039]  That's coming up.
[01:45:28.079 --> 01:45:29.740]  Right now, let's go through these calls quickly.
[01:45:30.620 --> 01:45:32.821]  I guess up first is James in Pittsburgh.
[01:45:32.861 --> 01:45:33.562]  Thanks for holding.
[01:45:34.222 --> 01:45:34.862]  Hey, Alex.
[01:45:35.022 --> 01:45:35.902]  Thanks for doing this show.
[01:45:35.942 --> 01:45:36.383]  It's great, man.
[01:45:37.702 --> 01:45:45.189]  I wanted to ask you, you interviewed Senator John DeCamp, I guess that was July of 2003 or something like that?
[01:45:45.489 --> 01:45:46.930]  Yeah, I've interviewed him three or four times.
[01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:47.911]  Okay.
[01:45:48.432 --> 01:46:00.142]  He was saying something about taking on Monsignor Hupp of Boys Town as he was going to be his attorney and Monsignor Hupp was going to come out with all types of revelations and whatnot.
[01:46:00.963 --> 01:46:04.206]  And then I read that Hupp was dead.
[01:46:05.023 --> 01:46:08.546]  About a month after he did that interview, and I was just wondering what was up with that.
[01:46:08.586 --> 01:46:09.747]  Was he killed or something?
[01:46:10.648 --> 01:46:11.449]  That's incredible.
[01:46:11.489 --> 01:46:14.091]  You know, I need to get Senator DeCamp back on.
[01:46:15.112 --> 01:46:25.201]  And again, Senator DeCamp puts out a book where it talks about the elite blowing children's heads off in front of big owls, and people were arrested.
[01:46:25.221 --> 01:46:29.105]  And he was actually hired by the Republicans to disprove it.
[01:46:29.145 --> 01:46:30.646]  Then his investigator got killed.
[01:46:30.686 --> 01:46:31.507]  His plane blew up.
[01:46:32.458 --> 01:46:35.899]  And then a bunch of people died, and I didn't know that Devon Sr.
[01:46:35.939 --> 01:46:37.880]  had died after he said he was going to go public.
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:40.141]  Yeah, it was a month after he was on your show.
[01:46:40.721 --> 01:46:41.161]  Devon Sr.
[01:46:41.181 --> 01:46:41.581]  was dead.
[01:46:41.781 --> 01:46:44.482]  I mean, he was an old man, so I didn't know what that was about.
[01:46:44.662 --> 01:46:44.962]  Yeah.
[01:46:46.043 --> 01:47:01.108]  It's kind of like the sheriff, Harwell, up in Waco, two days after he said he was going to go public about the truth of Waco, that the nightmares were too bad, he was found dead in his bathroom.
[01:47:02.375 --> 01:47:03.716]  Thought he was an old man.
[01:47:03.756 --> 01:47:05.016]  It was an accident.
[01:47:06.757 --> 01:47:24.006]  I also wanted to ask you, I saw on your TV show, I guess it was about the beginning of November or whatnot, and you said something about that you knew that it wasn't specifically the Catholics or the Jews or anything that control anything, but that you saw that there was
[01:47:25.333 --> 01:47:36.638]  Well, I mean, the Catholic Church has gone through different cycles of decadence and corruption and had different leaders in there.
[01:47:37.218 --> 01:47:41.920]  But clearly, the Catholic Church is a complete and total rubber stamp for the New World Order.
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:45.582]  I mean, the Pope's out saying one world religion, one world government.
[01:47:46.682 --> 01:47:48.323]  We all worship the same God.
[01:47:49.125 --> 01:47:54.467]  I mean, clearly the Catholic Church is very old, very wealthy, a giant institution.
[01:47:55.008 --> 01:47:58.189]  I don't think it's preeminent in the New World Order, as a lot of people think.
[01:47:59.290 --> 01:48:00.790]  No one group is preeminent.
[01:48:02.871 --> 01:48:09.514]  That is public group whose preeminent is the Luciferians that are in control of almost every major institution.
[01:48:14.416 --> 01:48:15.497]  So, are you there?
[01:48:15.517 --> 01:48:16.237]  Yep.
[01:48:17.100 --> 01:48:19.882]  I mean, you can disagree with that if you want, or you can agree.
[01:48:20.122 --> 01:48:20.582]  Any points?
[01:48:21.163 --> 01:48:30.729]  Well, I guess it seems like, I don't know, I would have a hard time believing that being Catholic, that the church as a whole or whatever was involved in this, but I guess, yeah, there can be corrupt factions.
[01:48:30.749 --> 01:48:32.770]  Well, I mean, look at the leadership of the Protestants.
[01:48:33.630 --> 01:48:38.133]  George Bush is a gift from God, a messenger, a prophet.
[01:48:38.673 --> 01:48:39.054]  That's true.
[01:48:39.314 --> 01:48:42.596]  I mean, it's, look, the Bible says that
[01:48:44.784 --> 01:48:48.406]  The powers that be are under the devil's control.
[01:48:48.426 --> 01:48:50.867]  The devil offered Christ the world up there on the mountain.
[01:48:52.448 --> 01:49:00.153]  To get into the highest positions now, you've got to be A-OK with the old serpent.
[01:49:03.695 --> 01:49:04.075]  Are you there?
[01:49:04.535 --> 01:49:04.895]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:05.135 --> 01:49:06.316]  I understand.
[01:49:06.356 --> 01:49:11.459]  The whole world is under the sway of the wicked one.
[01:49:11.719 --> 01:49:12.820]  God of this world...
[01:49:15.428 --> 01:49:16.329]  Dot of this world.
[01:49:16.709 --> 01:49:20.653]  I don't think that the Pope could be the real Pope if he was, like, totally down with this.
[01:49:21.213 --> 01:49:23.915]  Well, believe me, he's totally down with it.
[01:49:23.955 --> 01:49:25.537]  I mean, have you read the quotes?
[01:49:25.597 --> 01:49:28.679]  I mean, every year he calls for a world government and all that.
[01:49:28.699 --> 01:49:29.220]  Have you heard that?
[01:49:30.261 --> 01:49:30.581]  I don't know.
[01:49:30.601 --> 01:49:31.962]  I guess I've kind of shied away from it.
[01:49:32.242 --> 01:49:35.785]  Well, type in, Pope calls for one world government, one world religion.
[01:49:36.046 --> 01:49:37.947]  I mean, you'll get CNN with his quotes.
[01:49:41.770 --> 01:49:42.111]  All right, man.
[01:49:42.131 --> 01:49:42.331]  Thanks.
[01:49:42.791 --> 01:49:43.433]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:49:43.453 --> 01:49:45.117]  I mean, I'm not bashing Catholics here.
[01:49:45.137 --> 01:49:46.080]  I'm not bashing anybody.
[01:49:46.661 --> 01:49:47.543]  You ask the question.
[01:49:48.766 --> 01:49:50.691]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[01:49:51.112 --> 01:49:51.573]  Stay with us.
[01:49:53.775 --> 01:49:55.296]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.496 --> 01:49:58.578]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.698 --> 01:50:02.621]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.661 --> 01:50:06.904]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[01:50:07.244 --> 01:50:11.006]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:11.107 --> 01:50:12.968]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:16.231 --> 01:50:21.197]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.377 --> 01:50:24.421]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.601 --> 01:50:27.444]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.945 --> 01:50:34.072]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.592 --> 01:50:36.694]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:50:53.268 --> 01:50:53.908]  We're good to go.
[01:51:14.995 --> 01:51:21.479]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:51:21.679 --> 01:51:26.762]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:51:26.883 --> 01:51:35.748]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:51:36.028 --> 01:51:39.330]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.
[01:51:41.411 --> 01:51:45.434]  By calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:51:48.416 --> 01:51:50.837]  That's 888-803-4438.

[01:52:25.017 --> 01:52:25.477]  We're good to go.
[01:52:25.537 --> 01:52:25.858]  I think?
[01:52:57.733 --> 01:53:10.497]  All right, Richard and Linda and Randy and everybody else that's patiently holding, your calls are coming up.
[01:53:11.998 --> 01:53:14.999]  And I've got some of this police state legislation I want to go over.
[01:53:15.019 --> 01:53:17.359]  Oh man, there's so much here.
[01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:22.321]  Stem cell research, cloning, just a huge stack of
[01:53:24.170 --> 01:53:30.573]  Before we do this, and continue with your phone calls, please grab a pen and paper right now.
[01:53:31.854 --> 01:53:36.456]  You've heard the listeners, you've heard the callers, rave about my documentary films.
[01:53:37.857 --> 01:53:53.625]  They are the most effective documentaries out there exposing the global crime syndicate, the world crime families, because they give you the big picture, but then detail each area and each facet
[01:53:54.324 --> 01:53:55.665]  We put it in context.
[01:53:55.705 --> 01:53:56.845]  We show you the motive.
[01:53:57.586 --> 01:53:59.366]  We show you why the globalists are doing it.
[01:53:59.406 --> 01:54:00.267]  We show you the evidence.
[01:54:00.307 --> 01:54:03.248]  We show you in their own words, in their own video clips.
[01:54:04.289 --> 01:54:18.935]  America, destroyed by design, Police State 2000, Police State 2, The Takeover, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, Matrix of Evil, The Masters of Terror, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, Dark Secrets, Inside Bohemian Grove, America, Wake Up or Waco.
[01:54:19.455 --> 01:54:21.116]  These are all excellent films.
[01:54:21.196 --> 01:54:22.857]  My new film, American Dictators.
[01:54:24.005 --> 01:54:26.407]  Showing the modern dictatorship they're building.
[01:54:26.427 --> 01:54:28.308]  The police state, 9-11, it covers it all.
[01:54:28.929 --> 01:54:34.893]  I've got some of the videos as low, some of the new videos, as $5.95 a piece right now.
[01:54:36.554 --> 01:54:38.056]  Go to InfoWars.com.
[01:54:38.616 --> 01:54:40.537]  Order a whole bunch of them to give as gifts.
[01:54:41.558 --> 01:54:42.899]  You can't meet those prices.
[01:54:42.919 --> 01:54:45.861]  You don't want to just give somebody a copy for Christmas?
[01:54:46.382 --> 01:54:53.167]  Well, give them a nice color cover, hard copy with the stamp on the top, you know, the color image on the top of the DVD.
[01:54:54.508 --> 01:54:55.949]  We could just offer that on DVDs.
[01:54:55.969 --> 01:54:59.592]  When you buy one for the regular price, then we sell a traditional copy for $5.95.
[01:54:59.672 --> 01:55:03.215]  We've got a 9-11 special, four 9-11 videos, and a 300-and-something page book for $59.95, a $53 discount.
[01:55:13.553 --> 01:55:15.634]  We've got so many specials going right now.
[01:55:16.074 --> 01:55:24.657]  Go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, peruse the Safe Secure Online shopping cart, watch clips of the films, look at the different specials, and then order.
[01:55:25.277 --> 01:55:28.159]  And know that it supports this broadcast, but that's secondary.
[01:55:29.019 --> 01:55:31.080]  You'll have tools that will wake people up.
[01:55:31.820 --> 01:55:32.920]  We can change things.
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:34.101]  We can turn this around.
[01:55:34.461 --> 01:55:37.122]  We've got common sense and decency on our side.
[01:55:37.822 --> 01:55:39.763]  But we've got to move against the globalists.
[01:55:40.775 --> 01:55:44.356]  Or simply call toll-free to ask about the different specials or to order.
[01:55:45.717 --> 01:55:47.638]  Believe me, it's zero pressure when you call.
[01:55:47.698 --> 01:55:49.959]  I wish they had a little more pressure when you call.
[01:55:49.979 --> 01:55:51.459]  It's like, okay, you want this?
[01:55:51.579 --> 01:55:51.959]  All right.
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:54.480]  But give them a call and ask about the different videos.
[01:55:54.500 --> 01:55:54.560]  1-888-253-3139.
[01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:54.821]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:56:09.708 --> 01:56:10.888]  Or you can just write to me.
[01:56:10.968 --> 01:56:17.430]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:56:19.291 --> 01:56:20.631]  Please take action.
[01:56:22.271 --> 01:56:22.931]  Don't wait.
[01:56:23.192 --> 01:56:24.412]  Don't procrastinate.
[01:56:25.232 --> 01:56:25.952]  Get in the fight.
[01:56:26.012 --> 01:56:35.795]  And if you want instant access to all 11 of my films, my book, Paul Watson's book, my weekly TV reports, a lot of other great documentaries, frozenplanet.tv.
[01:56:37.532 --> 01:56:44.254]  We got connections for cable modems, DSL, dial-up, new stuff almost every day there on the site.
[01:56:44.394 --> 01:56:46.495]  Fifteen cents a day.
[01:56:47.075 --> 01:56:49.216]  A cup of coffee costs what?
[01:56:50.776 --> 01:56:51.696]  Seventy-five?
[01:56:51.716 --> 01:56:53.257]  A dollar twenty-five at Starbucks?
[01:56:53.297 --> 01:56:53.737]  Two bucks?
[01:56:55.037 --> 01:57:02.380]  I mean, for the price of coffee for one day, you get a whole week or more of the website.
[01:57:02.780 --> 01:57:03.680]  We need your support.
[01:57:04.040 --> 01:57:04.840]  PrisonPlanet.tv

[01:57:29.715 --> 01:57:30.355]  So stay with us.
[01:57:30.395 --> 01:57:33.338]  Third hour coming up, ladies and gentlemen.

[01:57:51.727 --> 01:57:52.748]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.489 --> 01:57:54.590]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.231 --> 01:57:56.092]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.812 --> 01:57:57.693]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.713 --> 01:58:02.038]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.578 --> 01:58:06.723]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:11.968 --> 01:58:13.209]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:15.151 --> 01:58:22.057]  Now into our number three, toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:23.538 --> 01:58:30.204]  Coming up, more details on experts calling for New World Body to fight global terrorism.
[01:58:31.445 --> 01:58:33.426]  More on what's really happening in Ukraine.
[01:58:34.287 --> 01:58:36.469]  Group defile war crime suit against U.S.
[01:58:36.529 --> 01:58:39.311]  over Abu Ghraib abuse in German courts.
[01:58:40.352 --> 01:58:43.355]  Brain scan shows difference in truth and lying.
[01:58:45.382 --> 01:58:49.967]  And much, much, much, much more.
[01:58:50.488 --> 01:58:53.671]  Nearly a month later, Ohio fight goes on.
[01:58:55.073 --> 01:58:58.457]  Bush makes first official visit to Canada today.
[01:58:58.477 --> 01:59:02.001]  That's just some of what's coming up in this third hour.
[01:59:03.817 --> 01:59:06.459]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:59:06.699 --> 01:59:09.120]  Richard, Richard, where are you calling us from?
[01:59:09.620 --> 01:59:10.141]  From Michigan.
[01:59:10.381 --> 01:59:10.741]  Welcome.
[01:59:11.221 --> 01:59:12.622]  Well, it's nice to finally talk to you.
[01:59:12.702 --> 01:59:15.784]  First off, screw Sean Hannity, you're a great American.
[01:59:17.545 --> 01:59:27.030]  One thing I wanted to bring up, I've seen all your documentaries just about, and what you have to say is just amazing.
[01:59:27.211 --> 01:59:31.273]  One of the articles you brought up about Eminem, and when he did that song Mosh,
[01:59:32.182 --> 01:59:35.464]  Well, how do you know they're influenced by me?
[01:59:35.484 --> 01:59:36.385]  Well, it's obvious.
[01:59:36.405 --> 01:59:41.328]  I mean, if you pick up his CD and listen to it, some of the exact same things that you have said he uses...
[02:00:04.535 --> 02:00:11.421]  I've been contacted by a lot of people across the board.
[02:00:11.621 --> 02:00:14.804]  Not even underground music people, but a lot of others.
[02:00:15.545 --> 02:00:18.167]  I think it's just an awakening across the board.
[02:00:18.187 --> 02:00:20.369]  I don't want to give myself credit for that.
[02:00:21.330 --> 02:00:24.292]  But we have reached out to the alternative audiences out there.
[02:00:24.312 --> 02:00:28.136]  Not just the old neocon audience that seems to be so brainwashed.
[02:00:29.006 --> 02:00:30.426]  By Lord Hannity and others.
[02:00:31.127 --> 02:00:37.829]  But no, it's very encouraging to see Eminem waking up and a bunch of his songs now are about the New World Order, working with Guerrilla News Network.
[02:00:38.389 --> 02:00:47.391]  There's the artist Paris, who I'm a fan of, who's a fan of this show, who we've talked to.
[02:00:47.411 --> 02:00:49.412]  Yeah, there's a lot of people.
[02:00:49.472 --> 02:00:50.292]  I mean, I'd love to...
[02:00:51.405 --> 02:00:52.325]  I'm one of those people.
[02:00:52.345 --> 02:00:55.646]  I'm one of those people that are out there trying to speak the truth through my music and stuff.
[02:00:55.666 --> 02:01:03.288]  And I wanted to know if you ever thought about, you know, getting together with some of these people and starting... Because entertainment can really wake a lot of people up.
[02:01:03.408 --> 02:01:05.828]  No, there's all sorts of networking and things I can do.
[02:01:05.868 --> 02:01:11.750]  The problem is I literally, literally work all the time just on what I'm doing.
[02:01:12.490 --> 02:01:13.350]  I'm overwhelmed.
[02:01:13.410 --> 02:01:15.250]  Maybe I have to do some reshuffling or something.
[02:01:15.290 --> 02:01:18.091]  But, I mean, you know, I was working until 2 in the morning last night.
[02:01:18.678 --> 02:01:20.219]  And I work like that almost every day.
[02:01:20.239 --> 02:01:20.659]  Right.
[02:01:21.059 --> 02:01:31.944]  And I took off a few days over Thanksgiving, and it almost messed me up, because I'm so used to doing what I'm doing that taking off a few days now makes it hard to get back into the grind.
[02:01:32.644 --> 02:01:37.967]  But every time I see a globalist up on TV trying to sell our country on the tubes, it re-energizes me.
[02:01:38.287 --> 02:01:41.688]  But, I mean, we get so bombarded by the mainstream media and everything.
[02:01:41.708 --> 02:01:42.789]  We need something...
[02:01:43.647 --> 02:01:46.209]  Well, I think that's happening.
[02:01:46.229 --> 02:01:57.117]  I mean, I think you put your finger on it that a lot of these people in music, you know, not just hip-hop people, but folks across the board are talking about the New World Order and globalism and propaganda.
[02:01:57.157 --> 02:01:58.778]  I mean, I hear it on the radio now.
[02:01:59.798 --> 02:02:04.863]  A bunch of different songs, groups, like A System of a Down.
[02:02:04.923 --> 02:02:08.265]  I don't even listen to much music, but I hear it all over the place.
[02:02:08.646 --> 02:02:09.386]  It's happening.
[02:02:09.426 --> 02:02:11.728]  The globalists are losing control.
[02:02:12.109 --> 02:02:13.350]  We are winning.
[02:02:16.852 --> 02:02:17.493]  I agree with you.
[02:02:17.513 --> 02:02:19.635]  But I mean, they don't need to network with me.
[02:02:20.395 --> 02:02:21.656]  They're just as smart as I am.
[02:02:21.696 --> 02:02:22.857]  They're all doing their own deal.
[02:02:23.298 --> 02:02:24.639]  Yeah, but see, that's the problem.
[02:02:24.719 --> 02:02:25.740]  It's so scattered out.
[02:02:26.040 --> 02:02:28.402]  The mainstream, they work together, they bombard you.
[02:02:28.792 --> 02:02:30.494]  You know, and then you have no choice.
[02:02:30.814 --> 02:02:40.103]  If you can get the underground information, the underground entertainment, get people entertained, like, a lot of people, I try to show them your documentaries and stuff, and it's not exciting enough for them, you know?
[02:02:40.123 --> 02:02:41.144]  Not exciting enough.
[02:02:41.324 --> 02:02:42.265]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[02:02:42.285 --> 02:02:42.946]  We'll be right back.
[02:02:43.006 --> 02:02:43.967]  People being put in camps.
[02:02:48.251 --> 02:02:53.736]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:54.157 --> 02:02:58.401]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:02:58.641 --> 02:03:05.668]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:06.048 --> 02:03:12.154]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:12.294 --> 02:03:13.515]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.695 --> 02:03:14.156]  We're good to go.
[02:03:30.632 --> 02:03:33.776]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.

[02:03:35.057 --> 02:03:35.277]  Call today.
[02:03:45.825 --> 02:03:53.650]  Terrorism, terrorism, chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:03:53.910 --> 02:03:55.511]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:03:55.751 --> 02:03:58.233]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:03:58.613 --> 02:04:13.182]  The video, Sheltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:13.222 --> 02:04:13.542]  government.
[02:04:13.722 --> 02:04:15.523]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:04:15.883 --> 02:04:21.805]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:21.945 --> 02:04:26.446]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.

[02:04:44.975 --> 02:04:49.317]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:04:49.497 --> 02:04:53.919]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:04:54.079 --> 02:04:58.461]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:04:58.481 --> 02:04:59.842]  The New World Order.
[02:05:01.624 --> 02:05:05.868]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:05:05.908 --> 02:05:12.856]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:05:12.976 --> 02:05:14.979]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:05:15.359 --> 02:05:25.825]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:05:25.965 --> 02:05:31.368]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:05:31.848 --> 02:05:34.510]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[02:05:35.770 --> 02:05:36.211]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:05:36.231 --> 02:05:38.032]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:05:46.092 --> 02:05:51.753]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.373 --> 02:05:54.974]  All right, let's go to your calls quickly.
[02:05:55.274 --> 02:05:57.874]  Just bam, bam, bam.
[02:05:57.894 --> 02:05:59.415]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:06:00.115 --> 02:06:01.895]  Linda in Boston, you're on the air.
[02:06:01.935 --> 02:06:02.275]  Welcome.
[02:06:03.015 --> 02:06:04.455]  Hi, Linda in Austin.
[02:06:04.856 --> 02:06:08.396]  Okay, well, Austin and Boston sound a lot alike, so that's how they got it wrong.
[02:06:08.636 --> 02:06:12.517]  And they're both probably pretty progressive on the same page, let's say.
[02:06:14.112 --> 02:06:42.161]  Your mention of the fact that Bush appointed the head of Kellogg's Cereal as his head of commerce today is ironic and disturbing because it seems like now he'll be able to keep exporting fat all over the United States and as he's been doing for many decades and it reminded me of the National Geographic magazine cover story I think in August of this year
[02:06:42.802 --> 02:06:52.846]  It was all about fat, and how the Department of Agriculture is really, the Department of Agriculture determines what healthy foods we should eat.
[02:06:53.806 --> 02:07:05.190]  And among them, for the last probably 10 or 15 years, they've considered breads and cereals as good foods for you, and they've had a skyrocket in children's obesity.
[02:07:05.971 --> 02:07:11.833]  And I just wanted to... No, no, I mean, everybody knows that massive intake of processed carbohydrates packs it on you.
[02:07:12.879 --> 02:07:15.080]  And that's what they've done, that's what they've pushed.
[02:07:15.140 --> 02:07:18.542]  But I mean, I've looked a little bit into this guy.
[02:07:18.602 --> 02:07:24.605]  He isn't a tenth as bad as Alberto Gonzalez for the job of Attorney General.
[02:07:24.645 --> 02:07:26.226]  I mean, you know about Gonzalez, right?
[02:07:27.526 --> 02:07:27.786]  Yeah.
[02:07:27.906 --> 02:07:33.049]  Gonzalez wrote the torture memos and said Bush is above the law and helped write the Patriot Acts.
[02:07:33.129 --> 02:07:35.210]  I mean, he is a piece of work.
[02:07:36.109 --> 02:07:44.376]  Yeah, but the way we approach our food policy kills a lot of people, too, with diabetes and overweight, obesity, heart attack.
[02:07:44.456 --> 02:07:48.879]  How many hundreds of percent points has diabetes gone up?
[02:07:48.959 --> 02:07:53.403]  I mean, now it's like just everybody's coming down with it.
[02:07:53.723 --> 02:07:57.606]  Yes, I think it's tripled in the last, like, 15 years or so.
[02:07:58.487 --> 02:08:01.870]  And so we could, again, we have to, like, eat...
[02:08:02.415 --> 02:08:03.035]  Avoid.
[02:08:03.135 --> 02:08:03.755]  Boycott.
[02:08:03.835 --> 02:08:05.036]  Boycott Kellogg's.
[02:08:05.076 --> 02:08:06.896]  Linda, you heard me play it again earlier.
[02:08:07.276 --> 02:08:08.517]  Mercury's good for you.
[02:08:08.877 --> 02:08:09.317]  Okay?
[02:08:09.597 --> 02:08:10.077]  Exactly.
[02:08:10.157 --> 02:08:12.058]  Let's just believe our government, okay?
[02:08:12.438 --> 02:08:14.659]  So what if all the diseases are increasing?
[02:08:15.199 --> 02:08:17.039]  So what if all this is happening?
[02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:20.720]  Linda, why don't you just drink some fluoride and feel better?
[02:08:23.261 --> 02:08:26.422]  Let's just eat all natural, organic, and...
[02:08:27.466 --> 02:08:28.647]  Boycott Walmart.
[02:08:28.667 --> 02:08:30.289]  That sounds like Al Qaeda talk.
[02:08:30.629 --> 02:08:33.651]  Start shopping and voting with our dollar.
[02:08:33.671 --> 02:08:35.433]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:08:35.473 --> 02:08:35.813]  Thank you so much.
[02:08:35.873 --> 02:08:36.594]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[02:08:37.114 --> 02:08:43.320]  By the way, I expect Bin Laden to start popping up in new tapes and he'll go, eat organic or we will get you.
[02:08:43.340 --> 02:08:45.101]  And then, oh my God, we can't eat organic!
[02:08:45.201 --> 02:08:46.542]  Al Qaeda's for it!
[02:08:46.562 --> 02:08:48.084]  I mean, literally, that's what he does.
[02:08:48.124 --> 02:08:51.146]  Every time they go, Saddam works with Al Qaeda.
[02:08:51.186 --> 02:08:52.648]  And then everybody goes, that's ridiculous.
[02:08:52.668 --> 02:08:54.009]  Saddam tries to hunt them down.
[02:08:54.944 --> 02:08:58.286]  Oh, Bin Laden just popped up for us saying he does work for him.
[02:08:58.366 --> 02:08:59.366]  Oh, thank you, Bin Laden.
[02:08:59.386 --> 02:09:07.810]  You know, four days before the election, vote for John Kerry or I'll kill you, knowing that would backfire.
[02:09:08.310 --> 02:09:11.772]  And then Karl Rove brags, thank you, Bin Laden, for the president.
[02:09:11.792 --> 02:09:12.412]  He actually said that.
[02:09:12.692 --> 02:09:14.313]  Thank you for the gift, Bin Laden.
[02:09:15.053 --> 02:09:15.974]  Oh, man.
[02:09:23.056 --> 02:09:25.017]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[02:09:26.277 --> 02:09:30.399]  Let's talk to David in Texas.
[02:09:30.539 --> 02:09:31.379]  David, you're on the air.
[02:09:31.419 --> 02:09:31.819]  Go ahead.
[02:09:31.839 --> 02:09:33.560]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[02:09:33.600 --> 02:09:34.140]  Nothing much.
[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:35.980]  Yeah, just a couple of things.
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:39.522]  Yeah, that national ID card thing is going on all over the place.
[02:09:39.542 --> 02:09:42.283]  Holland's getting that whole thing as well.
[02:09:42.483 --> 02:09:44.323]  Yeah, all at the very same time.
[02:09:44.343 --> 02:09:46.044]  It's going in everywhere.
[02:09:46.544 --> 02:09:46.804]  Right.
[02:09:47.044 --> 02:09:48.365]  It's for your safety.
[02:09:48.685 --> 02:09:52.206]  Also, I wanted to make mention that I'm putting together a wake-up kit
[02:09:52.819 --> 02:09:55.360]  And it's got several, it's like three discs now.
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:09:58.020]  I've got several of your movies on there.
[02:09:58.220 --> 02:09:59.840]  I've got George Humphrey on there.
[02:09:59.860 --> 02:10:02.061]  I've got little tidbits, some music.
[02:10:02.741 --> 02:10:12.483]  I've got documents and various things, Northwoods and Placid Comitatus and a lot of things I'm putting together on these discs and I'm handing them out.
[02:10:12.663 --> 02:10:14.003]  What a labor of love.
[02:10:14.043 --> 02:10:17.764]  And the beauty is, tell folks you give it to to make copies and have just one.
[02:10:17.804 --> 02:10:18.184]  Exactly.
[02:10:18.826 --> 02:10:19.266]  Exactly.
[02:10:19.427 --> 02:10:25.611]  And just if two of the ten people you give it to do that, then it'll be four, and twenty, and a hundred, and a thousand.
[02:10:25.691 --> 02:10:34.937]  Right, and I put a little notepad in there saying, you know, please make copies and stuff like that, and please don't be overwhelmed, take your time, look through it all, and everything like that.
[02:10:35.615 --> 02:10:37.016]  Yeah, I've been doing that.
[02:10:37.056 --> 02:10:38.257]  I've passed out about 30 of them so far.
[02:10:38.277 --> 02:10:42.239]  Why don't you just have the mindset that resistance is futile?
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:44.781]  Why don't you just submit and drink your mercury?
[02:10:45.301 --> 02:10:45.922]  Oh, no.
[02:10:46.182 --> 02:10:46.682]  No, thank you.
[02:10:47.523 --> 02:10:49.504]  Don't you want diabetes, though?
[02:10:50.605 --> 02:10:51.726]  There's enough of that going around.
[02:10:52.766 --> 02:10:55.368]  But, I mean, just take your Vioxx.
[02:10:55.648 --> 02:11:00.271]  Well, I happen to be on the path of the road less traveled, so, you know.
[02:11:00.932 --> 02:11:02.613]  But wouldn't it just be easier to...
[02:11:03.757 --> 02:11:04.057]  Sure.
[02:11:04.317 --> 02:11:06.658]  Sure, it would be easier, but then it wouldn't be worth it.
[02:11:08.239 --> 02:11:22.523]  But, yeah, I was also thinking, why don't, like, these various scattered groups, like, in every city, do, like, a NWO protest, like, on the seventh of every month or something?
[02:11:23.084 --> 02:11:27.025]  Or, like, even, like, that concert idea that that guy just came up with.
[02:11:29.336 --> 02:11:31.737]  Alex Jones doesn't have to lead everyone around.
[02:11:32.377 --> 02:11:40.780]  All these groups can get together, if they really feel that way, and have their own little concerts, maybe little tours and stuff like that, and do their own awakening.
[02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:41.560]  You know what I mean?
[02:11:42.040 --> 02:11:49.043]  Well, that's been going on, but it's hard to do without Claire Channel, who basically owns all the venues promoting it.
[02:11:49.403 --> 02:11:54.325]  Right, but I mean, if there was some monthly protest or some sort of
[02:11:55.210 --> 02:11:56.071]  In your face all the time.
[02:11:56.091 --> 02:11:57.372]  They can't ignore it for too long.
[02:11:57.912 --> 02:11:58.672]  No, I agree with you.
[02:11:58.712 --> 02:11:59.413]  Thanks for the call.
[02:12:00.414 --> 02:12:03.836]  Let's talk to Randy in Florida.
[02:12:03.896 --> 02:12:04.756]  Randy, welcome.
[02:12:06.257 --> 02:12:06.958]  Hey, Alex.
[02:12:07.278 --> 02:12:07.618]  Hello.
[02:12:07.718 --> 02:12:08.739]  Hope you had a good holiday.
[02:12:09.199 --> 02:12:09.919]  I did, yes.
[02:12:10.059 --> 02:12:12.401]  Actually, we took off a couple days.
[02:12:13.061 --> 02:12:16.243]  Hadn't done that in years, yeah.
[02:12:17.444 --> 02:12:23.748]  The Declaration talks about, you know, evincing a desire to reduce us under absolute despotism.
[02:12:24.679 --> 02:12:32.264]  And that's why it's being banned coast-to-coast in public schools, and that's why I have female on video teaching police that it is a terrorist document.
[02:12:32.865 --> 02:12:48.876]  My question for you is, given that, you know, I mean, how do these people that continue to prop up and support the two-party system, you know, in the globalists... Because they set it up like a football game where people think it's like us against them when it's a staged event.
[02:12:49.355 --> 02:13:05.686]  Now, what I'm getting to is that how are these people that continue to prop up the two-party system and the globalist puppet masters behind it, how are they any different than those that remain loyal to the King George called the Tories or the Nazi collaborators in World War II?
[02:13:06.146 --> 02:13:07.347]  Aren't they the same thing?
[02:13:07.387 --> 02:13:09.848]  We could just call them globalist collaborators instead?
[02:13:10.429 --> 02:13:11.650]  You know, that's a good idea.
[02:13:11.670 --> 02:13:15.252]  Globalist collaborators.
[02:13:15.663 --> 02:13:19.746]  You know, I mean, I don't see any tangible or credible difference between the two, you know.
[02:13:19.766 --> 02:13:23.489]  You can call them New World Order or Globus Collaborators, you know.
[02:13:23.789 --> 02:13:26.391]  Or Collaborators with the Forces of Death, yes.
[02:13:27.612 --> 02:13:30.374]  I just don't see how they're worthy of any respect or regard.
[02:13:30.394 --> 02:13:35.659]  They're just as contemptible for doing that, you know, as the people that are... Well, see, it's all an illusion.
[02:13:35.739 --> 02:13:37.740]  Most people go off what's popular and cool.
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:40.042]  The TV gives that image, then they just mimic it.
[02:13:40.911 --> 02:13:50.916]  I mean, I know these people out there who will repeat what they heard on the Sunday talk show on TV and then think they're smart as they repeat it to you.
[02:13:50.956 --> 02:13:54.638]  A lot of people think if you tell them about politics that you're talking down to them.
[02:13:55.058 --> 02:13:59.721]  Or they feel threatened by it and instantly psychologically deny it so they don't have to face up to it.
[02:13:59.941 --> 02:14:05.764]  Well, I've been wrestling with all this myself because most of my family, or all of them that I know of, voted for Bush.
[02:14:06.351 --> 02:14:09.133]  And it's caused no amount of rip and strain in our family ties?
[02:14:09.593 --> 02:14:12.575]  And again, to understand that, obviously you didn't vote for Kerry.
[02:14:13.316 --> 02:14:14.877]  No, I voted for Maruca.
[02:14:14.937 --> 02:14:16.258]  They'd have to shoot me for it.
[02:14:16.678 --> 02:14:19.440]  See, but when you say that, they think, oh, a liberal.
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:20.221]  No, no, no, folks.
[02:14:20.601 --> 02:14:22.903]  He didn't bet on either one of the fake horses.
[02:14:24.822 --> 02:14:27.964]  And then look at what Bush is doing, and you don't hear neocons talking about it.
[02:14:28.004 --> 02:14:37.869]  Well, that's my whole point, you know, because these people are, my family included, they're aiding and abetting in the destruction of our nation, you know, and it's very hard for me not to view that as a contemptible act.
[02:14:39.189 --> 02:14:42.791]  Well, I mean, just try to educate them as best you can.
[02:14:42.831 --> 02:14:45.413]  A lot of times family won't listen to family.
[02:14:45.433 --> 02:14:46.533]  Statistically, we've found that.
[02:14:46.553 --> 02:14:48.014]  I've been getting nowhere with them for years.
[02:14:48.034 --> 02:14:48.714]  Yeah, just reach out.
[02:14:49.295 --> 02:14:50.055]  Don't waste your time.
[02:14:50.075 --> 02:14:51.876]  If somebody just laughs at you, move on.
[02:14:52.631 --> 02:15:03.600]  Well, they just, you know, like my sister here, when I challenged, after she informed me that she voted for Bush, she said, well, he's a godly man and his heart is for people, you know, and he's trying to do the right thing.
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:05.822]  And I just told her, that's laughable.
[02:15:06.502 --> 02:15:09.424]  You know, I said, he's as godly a man as Ben Lawton is.
[02:15:09.485 --> 02:15:12.067]  I said, you know, I'm really sorry that you feel that way.
[02:15:13.688 --> 02:15:17.311]  Well, I mean, they've got to be willfully ignorant to not know that Bush...
[02:15:18.718 --> 02:15:21.521]  I mean, at the bare minimum, he's a fake.
[02:15:21.761 --> 02:15:23.462]  I mean, he goes to the Buddhist temple.
[02:15:23.502 --> 02:15:25.744]  He goes to the Shinto shrine.
[02:15:25.784 --> 02:15:26.705]  He goes to the mosque.
[02:15:27.306 --> 02:15:28.347]  He's just like Bill Clinton.
[02:15:28.407 --> 02:15:29.768]  I mean, he's praying somewhere else.
[02:15:29.828 --> 02:15:32.090]  He goes to the same church up there in D.C.
[02:15:32.110 --> 02:15:35.954]  that Clinton went to, which is pro-homosexual.
[02:15:38.959 --> 02:15:39.920]  Well, you're just a liberal.
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:40.520]  Thanks for the call.
[02:15:41.982 --> 02:15:44.684]  You've got to learn the double think here.
[02:15:44.804 --> 02:15:49.188]  All of the people he's appointing right now are anti-gun, pro-open border, pro-abortion.
[02:15:52.470 --> 02:15:53.151]  What do you do?
[02:15:54.552 --> 02:15:55.173]  What do you do?
[02:15:55.233 --> 02:15:56.233]  How do you deal with this?
[02:15:58.375 --> 02:16:00.477]  Speaking of that, I was listening to Limbaugh yesterday.
[02:16:00.497 --> 02:16:06.242]  When I'm out and about, I'll listen to talk radio to monitor what the ultra-socialists are doing.
[02:16:06.934 --> 02:16:09.135]  I mean, they're the next generation of takeover masters.
[02:16:09.155 --> 02:16:10.736]  They know how to act like they're conservatives.
[02:16:10.996 --> 02:16:16.299]  To fool you, he was going the mainstream media, new statistics out, they've lost even more viewers.
[02:16:16.699 --> 02:16:17.799]  It's all falling apart.
[02:16:17.819 --> 02:16:19.660]  The liberals are totally illegitimate.
[02:16:19.941 --> 02:16:20.961]  No one's believing them.
[02:16:21.461 --> 02:16:24.323]  You know, they're becoming irrelevant.
[02:16:24.983 --> 02:16:26.124]  Well, you are too.
[02:16:27.104 --> 02:16:28.425]  You are too, pillhead.
[02:16:30.066 --> 02:16:32.067]  It's not just them that have lost their credibility.
[02:16:32.087 --> 02:16:32.707]  You're losing it.
[02:16:33.908 --> 02:16:40.031]  You see, the globalists knew you'd wake up to media control, so they gave you a fake alternative that's known as the neocons.
[02:16:40.391 --> 02:16:44.733]  But the neocons give you the same thing, just different branding.
[02:16:46.654 --> 02:16:49.476]  By the way, let's take Gatorade.
[02:16:49.596 --> 02:16:50.356]  They do the same thing.
[02:16:51.077 --> 02:16:53.658]  Why are there 15 different flavors of Gatorade on the store shelf?
[02:16:53.678 --> 02:16:54.318]  Well, they'll tell you.
[02:16:54.678 --> 02:16:58.540]  It's to dominate shelf space so nothing else has room on the shelves.
[02:16:59.241 --> 02:17:00.181]  That's what globalists do.
[02:17:00.201 --> 02:17:03.483]  They just dominate the shelf space and give you a bunch of different flavors
[02:17:04.838 --> 02:17:05.618]  Of the same thing.
[02:17:07.679 --> 02:17:10.360]  Just different flavoring and different food color.
[02:17:11.400 --> 02:17:12.420]  And you think you have a choice.
[02:17:12.661 --> 02:17:15.061]  But it all came from the same factory off the same truck.
[02:17:17.662 --> 02:17:19.243]  So that's my analogy.
[02:17:21.123 --> 02:17:23.484]  And you drink it, it does the same thing to you.
[02:17:26.645 --> 02:17:29.666]  So that's all they're doing is giving you false choices.
[02:17:30.246 --> 02:17:32.687]  So you're the ones that are being discredited.
[02:17:33.539 --> 02:17:38.087]  I mean, how old is the Bill Clinton hating gonna get and talking about the liberals all day?
[02:17:38.107 --> 02:17:38.808]  I mean, it's just...
[02:17:39.893 --> 02:17:40.654]  It's a joke.
[02:17:40.714 --> 02:17:43.755]  It's like a junior high rah-rah football game or something.
[02:17:44.336 --> 02:17:45.817]  The news is coming up in more of your calls.
[02:17:46.117 --> 02:17:46.557]  Hey, folks.
[02:17:46.617 --> 02:17:48.618]  Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[02:17:48.999 --> 02:17:51.940]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[02:17:52.080 --> 02:17:55.743]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush-hour traffic every day.
[02:17:55.923 --> 02:17:58.364]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[02:17:58.524 --> 02:18:01.786]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[02:18:01.946 --> 02:18:09.311]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.
[02:18:09.511 --> 02:18:11.213]  It's not just a shortwave radio, though.
[02:18:11.293 --> 02:18:15.097]  You can also get AM and FM, listen to cassette, and control your CD changer.
[02:18:15.217 --> 02:18:17.119]  Call Freeway Radio today, toll free, 866-404-3600.
[02:18:17.139 --> 02:18:18.020]  That's 1-866-404-3600.
[02:18:18.120 --> 02:18:20.482]  Get your own Sony shortwave car stereo today for only $189.
[02:18:20.643 --> 02:18:22.264]  Install it in the boat, the RV, or your car.
[02:18:28.891 --> 02:18:33.335]  The good news for us is that you'll have GCN programming and crystal clear radio wherever you go.
[02:18:33.455 --> 02:18:38.560]  Don't get me wrong, I'd still rather be golfing than sitting in traffic, but freeway radio has eased my commute immensely.
[02:18:38.620 --> 02:18:41.122]  Call them today at 1-866-404-3600 and let them do the same for you.
[02:18:46.798 --> 02:18:51.281]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:18:51.641 --> 02:18:55.723]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:18:56.023 --> 02:18:56.564]  We listened.
[02:18:56.884 --> 02:19:01.847]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:19:02.147 --> 02:19:02.627]  We listened.
[02:19:03.008 --> 02:19:06.049]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:19:06.470 --> 02:19:06.990]  We listened.
[02:19:07.450 --> 02:19:08.010]  We're good to go.
[02:19:08.030 --> 02:19:08.230]  I think?
[02:19:37.365 --> 02:19:38.346]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:19:38.366 --> 02:19:40.008]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:19:45.268 --> 02:19:48.851]  Every hour of every day, someone out there is suffering from hemorrhoids.
[02:19:49.152 --> 02:19:51.674]  The pain, worry, and embarrassment can be devastating.
[02:19:51.854 --> 02:20:00.202]  For almost a decade, our customers have used Hemtab's natural formula to treat the problem at its source, to provide long-lasting relief in even the most severe of cases.
[02:20:00.462 --> 02:20:03.404]  My husband had been suffering from a painful hemorrhoid for years.
[02:20:03.765 --> 02:20:06.467]  After the doctor recommended surgery, we didn't know what to do.
[02:20:06.828 --> 02:20:10.551]  I ordered Hemtab online, and soon after taking Hemtab, the pain was gone.
[02:20:10.791 --> 02:20:12.752]  A few days later, the hemorrhoid began to shrink.
[02:20:13.033 --> 02:20:13.473]  Miracle?
[02:20:13.713 --> 02:20:14.854]  Hem miracle, we call it.

[02:20:46.555 --> 02:20:48.337]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[02:20:48.837 --> 02:20:52.259]  Last summer we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[02:20:52.759 --> 02:20:53.440]  Let's update.
[02:20:53.940 --> 02:20:57.382]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[02:20:57.502 --> 02:21:01.685]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[02:21:02.432 --> 02:21:03.393]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[02:21:03.413 --> 02:21:05.735]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[02:21:06.256 --> 02:21:07.156]  Today, the U.S.
[02:21:07.196 --> 02:21:09.419]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[02:21:09.819 --> 02:21:11.340]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[02:21:11.921 --> 02:21:13.903]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[02:21:15.264 --> 02:21:20.128]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[02:21:21.109 --> 02:21:21.870]  Gold is moving.
[02:21:22.130 --> 02:21:23.291]  Equities are treading water.
[02:21:23.692 --> 02:21:26.234]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[02:21:26.849 --> 02:21:28.249]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[02:21:28.669 --> 02:21:30.390]  Physical possession, private gold.
[02:21:30.790 --> 02:21:32.750]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[02:21:33.171 --> 02:21:37.031]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[02:21:37.452 --> 02:21:38.292]  Protect yourself.

[02:21:39.992 --> 02:21:40.352]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:21:40.372 --> 02:21:51.235]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:51.515 --> 02:21:53.935]  Crashing lies and disinformation.
[02:21:54.496 --> 02:21:56.376]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central.
[02:21:57.108 --> 02:22:00.989]  Back from 9 to midnight, Central Standard Time, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:22:02.070 --> 02:22:05.671]  Human cloning should be banned, Professor Wolpert says.
[02:22:06.351 --> 02:22:10.512]  This is out of the Science and Technology section of the Hindustan Times.
[02:22:11.153 --> 02:22:17.915]  Human reproductive cloning should be banned as a child born out of the process has a high probability of being abnormal.
[02:22:18.615 --> 02:22:24.617]  Lewis Wolpert, Professor of Anatomy and Development and Biology at the University College of London, said...
[02:22:28.380 --> 02:22:29.101]  Oh, boy.
[02:22:29.581 --> 02:22:51.456]  On Sunday, the gene therapy, which entails introducing genes to cure genetic disabilities, like cystic fibrosis, carries risk as well as new medical treatments, he said, while delivering a lectern on its science dangerous to mark the foundation day of the Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology.
[02:22:52.262 --> 02:22:59.351]  It is essential to recognize that reliable scientific knowledge is value-free and has no moral or ethical value.
[02:22:59.772 --> 02:23:04.678]  Dangers and ethical issues only arise when science is applied to technology, the professor said.
[02:23:06.124 --> 02:23:22.114]  About new medical treatments, he said that they are and they require complex technology and cannot be given to all, adding there has to be some principle of rationing, and this really does pose serious moral and ethical dilemmas.
[02:23:25.296 --> 02:23:27.958]  And, of course, the elite are going to have access to all of this.
[02:23:28.238 --> 02:23:31.680]  That's why they're pushing all of it, and you're not going to have access to it.
[02:23:33.815 --> 02:23:37.957]  They can do everything with adult stem cells they can do with baby parts.
[02:23:40.559 --> 02:23:42.039]  But they're not going to do it.
[02:23:42.060 --> 02:23:47.542]  Because it's quicker and easier and more dehumanizing to do it the other way.
[02:23:48.343 --> 02:23:55.767]  EPA looking at using tests on people, Associated Press, the same people that try to cover up Vioxx being bad for your heart.
[02:23:56.650 --> 02:24:04.956]  In setting limits on chemicals in food and water, the Environmental Protection Agency may rely on industry tests that expose people to poisons and raise ethical questions.
[02:24:06.417 --> 02:24:09.179]  They pay people to come in and have pesticides and stuff tested on them.
[02:24:09.679 --> 02:24:17.484]  The new policy, which the EPA is still developing, would allow Bush administration political appointees to refer any ethical disputes.
[02:24:18.405 --> 02:24:23.128]  Agency officials are putting the finishing touches on a plan to take a case-by-case approach.
[02:24:24.096 --> 02:24:38.086]  It says we're going to look at each study on its individual terms and accept studies unless they are fundamentally unethical or have significant deficiencies, said Bill Jordan, a senior policy advisor in EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs.
[02:24:39.647 --> 02:24:42.088]  We're setting the stage and making decisions about these studies.
[02:24:42.128 --> 02:24:47.192]  No guarantees that we'll accept the data guarantees that we will reject the data either.
[02:24:48.533 --> 02:24:50.494]  Oh, boy.
[02:24:51.798 --> 02:24:56.740]  So they're just going to basically accept any study that any chemical company wants to pay for itself.
[02:24:58.480 --> 02:25:01.842]  Bush makes first official visit to Canada today.
[02:25:02.242 --> 02:25:07.624]  Lord Bush is off assuring Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin that the U.S.
[02:25:07.704 --> 02:25:14.226]  regulatory process is well underway that could end a ban on Canadian beef imports, White House officials said.
[02:25:14.246 --> 02:25:17.887]  Yeah, because it's not like their beef's any more dangerous than ours.
[02:25:18.447 --> 02:25:20.468]  Our government's just good at covering up the mad cow.
[02:25:22.188 --> 02:25:30.314]  Iran has agreed to freeze its nuclear programs, Washington Post reporting, dropping a last-minute demand to keep using centrifuges.
[02:25:30.754 --> 02:25:46.666]  Iran agreed yesterday to suspend its nuclear program and won some additional concessions from the European Commission for a resolution that excludes many of the Bush administration's proposals for increasing pressure on the Islamic Republic.
[02:25:47.412 --> 02:26:01.500]  Resolution drafted by Britain, France, and Germany does not include the explicit threat the White House has sought reporting Iran to the UN Security Council for possible economic sanctions if it breaks the latest agreement.
[02:26:03.541 --> 02:26:06.723]  The United States contends Iran is building a nuclear weapons program.
[02:26:06.783 --> 02:26:12.946]  Iran, a nation rich in natural gas and oil systems, says it wants a nuclear capability to produce electricity.
[02:26:16.129 --> 02:26:16.389]  Hmm.
[02:26:16.930 --> 02:26:20.332]  Nearly a month later, Ohio fight goes on.
[02:26:20.352 --> 02:26:22.574]  This out of The Guardian.
[02:26:22.594 --> 02:26:25.497]  The Guardian carrying an AP article, I should add.
[02:26:26.257 --> 02:26:33.443]  Nearly a month after John Kerry conceded Ohio to Lord Bush, complaints and challenges about the balloting...
[02:26:36.873 --> 02:26:44.934]  Are mounting as activists, including Reverend Jackson, demanded close scrutiny to ensure the votes are being counted on an up-and-up.
[02:26:45.175 --> 02:26:49.135]  Now, again, the neocons, I don't like Jesse Jackson either.
[02:26:49.155 --> 02:26:55.836]  He's just as demagogue-like as any of these other people on the neocon side.
[02:26:56.457 --> 02:27:00.317]  Because Jackson's involved, they go after Jackson to make it a liberal conservative issue.
[02:27:00.817 --> 02:27:01.757]  It's not, folks.
[02:27:01.837 --> 02:27:03.578]  They didn't count 400,000 provisional ballots.
[02:27:05.467 --> 02:27:06.887]  Bush won by about 133,000.
[02:27:07.047 --> 02:27:12.908]  Most of the provisional or challenged ballots were Democrats.
[02:27:14.069 --> 02:27:16.329]  Don't worry, Kerry's not challenging it either.
[02:27:16.409 --> 02:27:20.290]  But Jackson has been holding rallies in Ohio in recent days to draw attention to the vote.
[02:27:20.750 --> 02:27:26.951]  Another critic plans to seek the Senate Supreme Court this week to decide the validity of the election.
[02:27:29.671 --> 02:27:32.592]  Hey, Democrats, your horse was a ringer.
[02:27:32.632 --> 02:27:33.392]  It doesn't even matter.
[02:27:36.286 --> 02:27:37.168]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.688 --> 02:27:39.291]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:40.212 --> 02:27:42.876]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:47.159 --> 02:27:48.640]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:51.121]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[02:27:51.461 --> 02:27:52.341]  Let me rephrase that.
[02:27:52.701 --> 02:27:53.922]  Oil War III has started.
[02:27:54.242 --> 02:27:56.663]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[02:27:57.083 --> 02:28:00.485]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[02:28:00.905 --> 02:28:04.726]  Why else would the US be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[02:28:04.986 --> 02:28:06.247]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[02:28:06.707 --> 02:28:11.169]  The nations of the Earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[02:28:11.609 --> 02:28:15.571]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[02:28:16.131 --> 02:28:22.014]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.

[02:28:29.478 --> 02:28:35.141]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[02:28:35.581 --> 02:28:35.802]  That's 1-800-453-2202.

[02:28:37.502 --> 02:28:37.823]  That's 800-453-2202.
[02:28:45.822 --> 02:28:48.864]  Dad, that cocoon stuff really got rid of your gray hair.
[02:28:49.045 --> 02:28:55.570]  I'm that 44-year-old guy you've heard talking about taking Cocoon GH and how it helped reverse my gray hairs.
[02:28:55.690 --> 02:28:57.491]  And here's some more great news.
[02:28:57.611 --> 02:29:01.094]  Taking Cocoon GH can improve your life in many ways.
[02:29:01.234 --> 02:29:05.837]  Cocoon basically repairs your body to a youthful state you perhaps had 10 or 20 years ago.
[02:29:06.818 --> 02:29:09.380]  I'm taking Cocoon GH, and here's what I notice.
[02:29:09.540 --> 02:29:14.945]  After a few sprays in my mouth, I'm in peak condition mentally, emotionally, and physically.
[02:29:15.065 --> 02:29:18.027]  In the state I get from Cocoon, I feel unstoppable.
[02:29:18.328 --> 02:29:20.149]  And you can have the same feeling.
[02:29:20.389 --> 02:29:30.338]  If you're tired, run down, want to boost your sexual performance, want to help wipe out back pain or arthritis, you need to start taking Cocoon GH right now.
[02:29:30.638 --> 02:29:34.761]  If you want similar results, call now to order Cocoon GH.

[02:29:45.899 --> 02:29:49.462]  Do you know where the 78 potentially active volcanoes in the U.S.
[02:29:49.522 --> 02:29:50.023]  are located?
[02:29:50.223 --> 02:29:53.606]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[02:30:48.777 --> 02:30:54.802]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:30:55.402 --> 02:30:58.385]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:31:01.908 --> 02:31:04.470]  I was on a radio program last night for three hours.
[02:31:05.555 --> 02:31:06.335]  Jeff Rentsch Show.
[02:31:06.355 --> 02:31:08.856]  We went over my analysis of Patriot Act II.
[02:31:10.656 --> 02:31:20.198]  And then I mentioned S-742 that failed to pass last year, but very narrowly, out of Oregon.
[02:31:20.678 --> 02:31:31.219]  And then I reminded his listeners of how earlier this year in Rhode Island, they almost passed a law that had the similar provisions in it.
[02:31:31.299 --> 02:31:34.320]  Criticize the government you're arrested, put in prison for life.
[02:31:34.887 --> 02:31:38.848]  And the governor apologized after we lobbied against it and said, I didn't read the bill.
[02:31:39.168 --> 02:31:40.329]  Homeland Security wrote it.
[02:31:40.809 --> 02:31:43.250]  And that was in the Providence Journal.
[02:31:43.310 --> 02:31:45.551]  It was in the local NBC TV station.
[02:31:45.891 --> 02:31:48.892]  We have that on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:31:49.332 --> 02:31:52.473]  So they're trying to pass stuff like this all over the country.
[02:31:53.093 --> 02:32:01.576]  Not just Patriot Act I that already passed or trying to pass Patriot Act II and this new 9-11 bill coming up here in the next few weeks.
[02:32:01.696 --> 02:32:04.177]  But they're trying this at the state level.
[02:32:06.343 --> 02:32:10.546]  And understand, they're charging pot dealers, county commissioners, and bid rigging.
[02:32:11.908 --> 02:32:25.639]  They're charging people who make too many phone calls to the VA complaining, and they say, well, he didn't threaten anybody at the Veterans Affairs, but complaining too much is harassment, and that's terrorism, so we're going to arrest this veteran.
[02:32:26.219 --> 02:32:28.681]  Or, oh, this lady was selling knockoff Rubik's Cubes.
[02:32:28.721 --> 02:32:32.364]  Homeland Security came and told her not to sell them, even though the cubes aren't illegal.
[02:32:33.785 --> 02:32:34.866]  We've interviewed all these people.
[02:32:35.817 --> 02:32:37.498]  There's hundreds of cases of this.
[02:32:38.839 --> 02:32:42.101]  State prosecutors have said that everything's terrorism.
[02:32:42.542 --> 02:32:44.783]  Oh, the cameras are up to fight terror and crime.
[02:32:45.564 --> 02:32:48.025]  The handbooks, they give the 400,000 truck drivers.
[02:32:48.085 --> 02:32:49.606]  Or do you see a man and woman arguing?
[02:32:49.626 --> 02:32:51.247]  Is someone wearing a backpack?
[02:32:51.287 --> 02:33:02.615]  I've got an AP article today where they're training shopping mall security guards that if someone is gripping their bag or talking in a hushed voice, go ahead and call the police.
[02:33:02.635 --> 02:33:03.836]  They're probably terrorists.
[02:33:06.027 --> 02:33:08.789]  God forbid you're walking and your stomach starts hurting or something.
[02:33:08.809 --> 02:33:11.231]  I mean, it's happened to all of us, hasn't it?
[02:33:11.351 --> 02:33:18.356]  We're out shopping or something, and we've got a stomachache or something, or kind of ripped your bag, or, oh, that's it, Alcada, Alcada, Alcada!
[02:33:19.637 --> 02:33:23.620]  They're talking about putting scanners and metal detectors in when you go into the malls.
[02:33:23.660 --> 02:33:24.681]  The FBI's called for that.
[02:33:25.361 --> 02:33:26.182]  All this is going on.
[02:33:26.202 --> 02:33:27.322]  So I pulled up an article.
[02:33:27.723 --> 02:33:30.565]  It was in the Wisconsin State Journal.
[02:33:31.943 --> 02:33:34.185]  Out of Madison, Wisconsin.
[02:33:34.685 --> 02:33:36.886]  Headline, paper terrorist gets five years.
[02:33:36.966 --> 02:33:42.670]  Man was convicted for filing legal documents against officials he blamed for the foreclosure of his property.
[02:33:44.051 --> 02:33:48.314]  It was a pro-life activist who was paralyzed from the chest down.
[02:33:48.834 --> 02:33:50.955]  They wanted his 38 acres, and we have the article.
[02:33:52.896 --> 02:34:02.342]  Ozoki County tax protester labeled a paper terrorist of a state prosecutor was sentenced Friday to five years in prison for filing harassing documents against government officials.
[02:34:03.043 --> 02:34:20.594]  Steve A. Magrits, 57, was convicted by a Dane County jury in November of seven counts of criminal slander of title for filing legal documents including liens and involuntary bankruptcy petitions against officials that he blamed for the foreclosure of his...
[02:34:21.594 --> 02:34:24.856]  Of his home in Fredonia property.
[02:34:26.197 --> 02:34:33.362]  What you need is a period of punishment to deter you from behaving like this in the future, Circuit Judge William Faust told Magritch.
[02:34:33.842 --> 02:34:51.134]  You need a sentence that says to others who are engaging in the same type of activity that a person in response to this kind of behavior, a person who's responsible for this kind of behavior, Wisconsin criminal slander of title statute makes it illegal to file a document related to the financial or security interest of another,
[02:34:52.113 --> 02:34:52.673]  It goes on.
[02:34:53.314 --> 02:34:54.715]  And I've got other articles here.
[02:34:54.775 --> 02:34:56.837]  They had one in the Milwaukee Journal.
[02:34:56.857 --> 02:35:00.840]  I was trying to find it this morning and I printed it somewhere in the stack.
[02:35:04.042 --> 02:35:04.643]  It's out of control.
[02:35:04.683 --> 02:35:06.124]  Looks like I've got too many articles.
[02:35:07.425 --> 02:35:09.386]  Where they wanted 50 years.
[02:35:09.686 --> 02:35:15.471]  And the prosecutor, who by the way was involved, his cousin was getting the property,
[02:35:16.036 --> 02:35:17.976]  Saying, you're not allowed to sue public officials.
[02:35:18.016 --> 02:35:18.757]  That's illegal.
[02:35:18.817 --> 02:35:19.717]  That's terrorism.
[02:35:20.077 --> 02:35:21.817]  I want 50 years, Judge.
[02:35:22.097 --> 02:35:23.098]  He only got five.
[02:35:24.798 --> 02:35:31.839]  So that's an oldie but a horribly, one of the older ones, examples of this type of stuff happening.
[02:35:33.180 --> 02:35:35.760]  Okay, now this is what they tried to pass last year in Oregon.
[02:35:35.780 --> 02:35:36.881]  This almost passed.
[02:35:37.341 --> 02:35:43.182]  The head of the committee, Senator Minnis, this is no joke, go to prisonplanet.com and type in SS,
[02:35:43.917 --> 02:35:47.120]  Uppercase S, 742, and it's the top link.
[02:35:49.622 --> 02:35:53.126]  The following summary, again, ladies and gentlemen, is the bill.
[02:35:54.147 --> 02:36:03.756]  A bill for an act creates the crime of terrorism, punishes by life imprisonment, relating to terrorism, creating new provisions, and amending Section 19.
[02:36:06.596 --> 02:36:07.417]  And it says, Section 1.
[02:36:08.237 --> 02:36:23.848]  A person commits the crime of terrorism if the person knowingly plans, participates in, or carries out any act that is intended by at least one of its participants to disrupt A. The free and orderly assembly of inhabitants of the state of Oregon.
[02:36:23.908 --> 02:36:27.090]  B. Commerce of the transportation system of the state of Oregon.
[02:36:27.290 --> 02:36:32.954]  Or the educational or governmental institutions of the state of Oregon or its inhabitants. 2.
[02:36:36.869 --> 02:36:44.111]  A person commits the crime of terrorism if the person conspires to do any of the activities described in subsection 1 of this section.
[02:36:46.552 --> 02:36:47.773]  And then it gets into it.
[02:36:48.893 --> 02:37:02.417]  B of B. When a person is convicted of terrorism under this section, the court shall order the person be confined for a minimum of 25 years without the possibility of parole, released to a forest work camp.
[02:37:03.438 --> 02:37:04.278]  And again, it says...
[02:37:05.817 --> 02:37:14.744]  Up above this, a person shall be given life in prison unless the judge designates that they be given 25 years in a forest work camp.
[02:37:15.304 --> 02:37:16.525]  Let me find that part here.
[02:37:17.927 --> 02:37:19.648]  A person commits a crime of terrorism.
[02:37:19.668 --> 02:37:24.432]  The person only plans, participates, and carries out any of the... that is intended to do this.
[02:37:24.512 --> 02:37:26.773]  And then it says... Find the part here.
[02:37:26.793 --> 02:37:29.475]  It says life in prison.
[02:37:32.218 --> 02:37:33.719]  And then down here, it says...
[02:37:35.780 --> 02:37:37.201]  What they've done to get this.
[02:37:44.247 --> 02:37:45.848]  Reading these bills is something else.
[02:37:46.589 --> 02:37:53.074]  And then it gets into all of the things in there that are acts of terrorism.
[02:37:53.535 --> 02:37:54.315]  And there's 133 of them.
[02:37:54.335 --> 02:37:58.639]  And it starts out with stuff that sounds pretty reasonable.
[02:37:59.299 --> 02:38:00.440]  Bribe giving.
[02:38:01.561 --> 02:38:02.482]  And then it gives the code.
[02:38:03.061 --> 02:38:04.161]  Bribe receiving.
[02:38:04.662 --> 02:38:06.002]  Public investment fraud.
[02:38:06.542 --> 02:38:07.543]  Bribing a witness.
[02:38:07.583 --> 02:38:09.063]  But still, not life in prison, folks.
[02:38:09.504 --> 02:38:10.804]  Bribe receiving by a witness.
[02:38:10.824 --> 02:38:12.505]  Then it gets into child pornography.
[02:38:12.765 --> 02:38:14.666]  You know, stuff where you do deserve life in prison.
[02:38:15.826 --> 02:38:17.927]  If it can be proven that you're actually manufacturing it.
[02:38:18.347 --> 02:38:19.467]  But it just says possession.
[02:38:20.728 --> 02:38:24.149]  So the first 15 or 20 things are stuff we would agree with.
[02:38:24.850 --> 02:38:26.930]  Then it gets into downloading music.
[02:38:27.591 --> 02:38:29.171]  Owning a firearm illegally.
[02:38:29.651 --> 02:38:30.892]  Writing a bad check.
[02:38:33.334 --> 02:38:53.836]  So, by the time you get down to 20, it's theft by extortion, 21, theft by deception, 22, theft by receiving as defined, theft of services, so now you don't pay a bill, that's 23, 24, unauthorized use of a vehicle, 25, mail theft or receipt of stolen mail,
[02:38:54.744 --> 02:38:57.825]  I mean, how many of us get the wrong mail sent to our mailbox?
[02:38:58.165 --> 02:39:00.506]  26, laundering a monetary instrument.
[02:39:01.626 --> 02:39:07.268]  27, engaging in financial transaction in property derived from unlawful activity.
[02:39:07.288 --> 02:39:11.429]  28, burglary in the second degree, possession of burglar tools.
[02:39:12.253 --> 02:39:13.153]  Well, that could be anything.
[02:39:13.653 --> 02:39:21.375]  Burglary in the first degree, burglary in the second degree, arson in the second degree, arson in the first degree, computer crime as defined in Section 164.377.
[02:39:21.475 --> 02:39:24.536]  A lot of these I haven't even looked up.
[02:39:24.796 --> 02:39:25.196]  I need to.
[02:39:25.216 --> 02:39:26.016]  They don't even say where it is.
[02:39:26.536 --> 02:39:29.137]  Robbery in the third degree, robbery in the second degree.
[02:39:29.157 --> 02:39:30.417]  So it goes through all these.
[02:39:31.097 --> 02:39:34.238]  And by the time you get down to the 40s, listen to this.
[02:39:34.918 --> 02:39:39.859]  Unlawful labeling of a video recording as defined in ORS.
[02:39:41.221 --> 02:39:42.282]  Code 164872.
[02:39:43.583 --> 02:39:48.468]  Unlawful recording of live performances as defined in ORS 164.
[02:39:48.748 --> 02:39:52.272]  So, videotape of a rock concert, life in prison.
[02:39:52.512 --> 02:39:53.233]  It actually says it.
[02:39:54.434 --> 02:40:00.580]  It says engaging and endangering aircraft as defined in ORS 164885.
[02:40:01.381 --> 02:40:03.463]  Interfering with agricultural operations.

[02:41:12.573 --> 02:41:15.074]  Again, they don't even say what that is.
[02:41:15.094 --> 02:41:15.775]  I've got to go look it up.
[02:41:16.355 --> 02:41:18.337]  Cellular counterfeiting, 62.
[02:41:18.737 --> 02:41:20.518]  Cellular counterfeiting, second degree, 64.

[02:41:49.713 --> 02:41:53.095]  72, another violation of a code, but I'll tell you what it is.
[02:41:53.116 --> 02:41:56.438]  73, unlawful possession of armor-piercing ammunition, life in prison. 74...
[02:41:58.300 --> 02:42:01.541]  Another violation of unnamed code.

[02:42:03.622 --> 02:42:05.043]  Here's an interesting one.
[02:42:05.383 --> 02:42:08.944]  76, unlawful manufacture of a destructive device, as defined.
[02:42:09.344 --> 02:42:12.485]  Possession of a hoax destructive device.

[02:42:31.872 --> 02:42:32.872]  It just says, look at the code.

[02:42:56.998 --> 02:43:10.688]  Exhibiting an obscene performance to a minor, but then they can say an obscene performance is, you know, if your child sneaks a Playboy out from under your sink or whatever.

[02:43:45.126 --> 02:43:45.767]  It took forever.
[02:43:46.247 --> 02:43:49.451]  But you read in here, let me just read the opening again.
[02:43:49.891 --> 02:43:52.955]  Creates the crime of terrorism, punishes by life imprisonment.
[02:43:54.336 --> 02:44:06.950]  Relating to terrorism, creating new provisions and amending Section 19 of Oregon laws, being enacted to the people of the state of Oregon, Section 1A, a person commits the crime of terrorism if the person not only plans, participates in, or creates...
[02:44:07.498 --> 02:44:12.322]  Carries out any act that is intended by at least one of the participants to disrupt.
[02:44:12.402 --> 02:44:15.925]  So if one person in a protest does something wrong, you all get locked in prison.
[02:44:16.085 --> 02:44:21.530]  A. The free and orderly assemblage of inhabitants of the state of Oregon.
[02:44:21.810 --> 02:44:27.815]  And you could even read the Oregonian story with the headline, Bill would put protesters in prison for life.
[02:44:31.198 --> 02:44:33.320]  I need to stop laughing about this.
[02:44:33.380 --> 02:44:33.980]  It's not funny.
[02:44:35.379 --> 02:44:37.581]  That's the type of stuff they're trying to pass.
[02:44:39.222 --> 02:44:39.623]  Okay?
[02:44:41.765 --> 02:44:43.146]  That's the kind of stuff they're doing.
[02:44:44.607 --> 02:44:48.310]  Let's go ahead and talk to Dan in North Carolina.
[02:44:48.350 --> 02:44:49.111]  I've got to move quick.
[02:44:49.151 --> 02:44:49.731]  Dan, go ahead.
[02:44:50.072 --> 02:44:50.732]  Hey, Alex.
[02:44:50.752 --> 02:44:52.314]  That was some kind of list.
[02:44:52.354 --> 02:44:55.496]  Too bad boat rigging isn't on that list also.
[02:44:56.157 --> 02:44:58.679]  I'm called to disagree with you.
[02:44:58.719 --> 02:45:02.883]  You were talking about the Catholic Church about an hour ago or so.
[02:45:03.391 --> 02:45:06.513]  And specifically, I want to disagree with you on the issue of the Pope.
[02:45:07.153 --> 02:45:14.137]  No one kind of understands what the Pope is doing, but there is a realization in the Catholic Church that the Church...
[02:45:15.162 --> 02:45:23.506]  That is, the Pope and the Vatican are two different things, and the Vatican is just overrun with masons and homosexuals, and a lot of the seminaries are.
[02:45:23.826 --> 02:45:34.031]  Sir, the caller asked me about the Catholic Church, and I just said this Pope is called for world government, this Pope is called for a new world order, he's called for one world religion.
[02:45:34.071 --> 02:45:35.472]  I mean, what do you disagree with?
[02:45:35.932 --> 02:45:39.954]  Well, that's not quite exactly what he's called for, and in fact, though,
[02:45:40.330 --> 02:45:45.995]  The Pope is holding the line on some of the things that the true conservatives hold here and here.
[02:45:46.015 --> 02:45:47.015]  Well, he's come out against abortion.
[02:45:47.035 --> 02:45:50.318]  Abortion and homosexuality and the priesthood.
[02:45:50.338 --> 02:45:51.019]  Look, look, look, look.
[02:45:51.239 --> 02:45:52.560]  I'm not a Catholic basher.
[02:45:52.900 --> 02:45:54.321]  Hold on a minute.
[02:45:54.361 --> 02:45:54.682]  Hold on.
[02:45:54.742 --> 02:45:55.903]  I'm not Catholic either.
[02:45:57.224 --> 02:46:02.568]  And I say that all these big groups have been taken control of, and clearly the Catholic Church has been taken over.
[02:46:02.888 --> 02:46:03.949]  I totally agree with you.
[02:46:04.009 --> 02:46:05.190]  I totally agree with you there.
[02:46:05.770 --> 02:46:08.433]  The other thing that I wanted to add is just that you were talking about...
[02:46:09.524 --> 02:46:10.165]  We're good to go.
[02:46:24.493 --> 02:46:40.843]  The despicable portrayal of a Christian leader, Empress Maria Theresa in Austria-Hungary, but her son that you were referring to last week, who was a specialist in taking over these governments, was a Mason, was a known Mason, and thought that the Masons were great, and it was a great idea to take over.
[02:46:40.883 --> 02:46:42.204]  By the way, that's a good point.
[02:46:43.504 --> 02:46:46.046]  They killed him over doing the magic flute.
[02:46:46.795 --> 02:46:49.317]  I mean, that was even in major French newspapers, that he was poisoned.
[02:46:49.617 --> 02:46:50.658]  Sure, sure.
[02:46:50.738 --> 02:46:53.319]  Because he exposed their secret rituals and stuff.
[02:46:53.940 --> 02:46:56.822]  And he was a member of the Illuminati, and he turned against them.
[02:46:57.622 --> 02:46:58.983]  So they whacked him.
[02:46:59.964 --> 02:47:06.068]  But just so you know, again, we've redesigned ArnoldExposed.com.
[02:47:06.088 --> 02:47:07.169]  Everybody should go look at it.
[02:47:07.729 --> 02:47:09.090]  And the movement's really moving forward.
[02:47:09.110 --> 02:47:10.591]  I want to thank folks for all their support.
[02:47:10.611 --> 02:47:11.712]  But we need more support.
[02:47:12.478 --> 02:47:16.184]  And, yeah, that's Austria's specialty is doing that.
[02:47:16.564 --> 02:47:18.347]  On Arnold, just a quick story.
[02:47:18.588 --> 02:47:20.090]  My brother, who is one of these yuppies...
[02:47:21.046 --> 02:47:28.531]  I told him a couple weeks ago, I said, oh yeah, they're going to put, or Arnold Schwarzenegger is going to be nominated by the Republicans.
[02:47:28.551 --> 02:47:31.712]  And we don't know for certain, but it seems like it's going that way.
[02:47:32.073 --> 02:47:35.615]  But my brother said, no, I would never vote for Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:47:35.635 --> 02:47:37.936]  And I said, what if they put Hillary against him?
[02:47:38.396 --> 02:47:41.118]  And he said, oh, I'd definitely vote for Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:47:41.358 --> 02:47:46.941]  And now all these big newspapers, just like I said a month ago, here it is with William Sapphire.
[02:47:46.981 --> 02:47:49.803]  He said they're going to run him against Hillary and he's going to vote for him.
[02:47:51.277 --> 02:47:52.518]  Yep.
[02:47:52.718 --> 02:47:56.061]  I can't fix my yuppie family, but I'll keep trying.
[02:47:57.002 --> 02:48:04.929]  Well, you know, when the Republicans stick Arnold out there, about a year before when Hillary announces, they'll go, we're having a constitutional convention over gay marriage.
[02:48:05.189 --> 02:48:06.370]  Come on, get Arnold in there.
[02:48:06.510 --> 02:48:07.651]  Only he can defeat Hillary.
[02:48:07.671 --> 02:48:11.074]  And they'll go, all right, and I'll be called a liberal and everything else.
[02:48:11.154 --> 02:48:13.276]  And how dare you not be for Arnold?
[02:48:13.336 --> 02:48:14.477]  I mean, it's all coming down, folks.
[02:48:14.497 --> 02:48:15.098]  This is serious.
[02:48:15.538 --> 02:48:18.761]  Keep up the good work, Alex, and I hope you're getting rich off of what you're doing.
[02:48:19.680 --> 02:48:20.641]  No, not really.
[02:48:20.681 --> 02:48:22.302]  We put all the money back into the fight.
[02:48:23.142 --> 02:48:25.164]  We need people to support us, bottom line.
[02:48:26.284 --> 02:48:29.967]  Betty and Jeffrey and Regina, you know, I've got some money in the bank, and I don't even spend it.
[02:48:30.307 --> 02:48:30.887]  A little bit of money.
[02:48:30.907 --> 02:48:32.248]  I don't even care about money.
[02:48:33.009 --> 02:48:33.749]  Really, I don't.
[02:48:35.570 --> 02:48:37.532]  The real world, folks, that's what I'm into.
[02:48:37.912 --> 02:48:38.612]  Fightin' tyranny.
[02:48:39.073 --> 02:48:39.733]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:47.040 --> 02:48:54.402]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my most comprehensive documentary exposing the New World Order's orchestration of the September 11th attacks yet.
[02:48:54.683 --> 02:48:59.424]  In my new film, The Masters of Terror, we chronicle the globalist master plan for world domination.
[02:48:59.644 --> 02:49:05.286]  The Masters of Terror details how the elite are using manufactured terrorism to drive the world population into accepting tyranny.
[02:49:05.526 --> 02:49:10.070]  Witness in horror the execution of the September 11th attacks and the ensuing whitewash.
[02:49:10.290 --> 02:49:17.435]  The casual society control grid, infallible microchips, mass mind control, militarization of police, concentration camps, foreign troops massing on U.S.
[02:49:17.455 --> 02:49:21.999]  soil, the USA Patriot Act, Super Big Brother Total Information Awareness Network, and much, much more.
[02:49:22.159 --> 02:49:24.661]  It is absolutely vital that everyone see the masters of terror.
[02:49:24.901 --> 02:49:30.265]  Only by exposing the perpetrators of September 11th can we stop them from carrying out the next wave of attacks and destroying
[02:49:30.285 --> 02:49:30.505]  That's 888-253-3139.

[02:51:50.780 --> 02:51:52.681]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:51:53.161 --> 02:51:55.982]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:51:57.663 --> 02:52:00.604]  No, really, possessions are somewhat of a curse.
[02:52:00.624 --> 02:52:01.384]  They're a hassle.
[02:52:02.545 --> 02:52:06.446]  Just taking care of things I own is an endless headache.
[02:52:06.466 --> 02:52:08.667]  I like to take a walk through the woods for about two hours.
[02:52:08.707 --> 02:52:12.508]  That's the equivalent of about ten gold pieces in my hand.
[02:52:12.528 --> 02:52:16.390]  If I had my druthers, I'd be out fishing and hiking around and
[02:52:17.430 --> 02:52:21.752]  Money, to me, is just fuel to put in the engine to fight the New World War and to be secure.
[02:52:22.953 --> 02:52:31.697]  And speaking of money, we need your support at ArnoldExposed.com to run these ads that we're producing right now, run in select areas of California to force the media to cover it.
[02:52:32.117 --> 02:52:39.020]  Go to ArnoldExposed.com and give to us via PayPal or just write checks to Alex Jones and say in the margin there where it says memo that...

[02:53:21.008 --> 02:53:21.488]  You're on the air.
[02:53:21.508 --> 02:53:21.729]  Go ahead.
[02:53:35.273 --> 02:53:35.573]  Hi.
[02:53:36.054 --> 02:54:00.011]  Do you know of any self-help groups in Austin or pro bono attorneys that would help a person that has a problem with the opposing legal side's attorney is an appointed special prosecutor and his friends and or police agents
[02:54:01.058 --> 02:54:09.164]  Coming into a person's apartment and taking their documented evidence and even writing on the evidence.
[02:54:10.485 --> 02:54:13.948]  Look, police corruption, judicial tyranny is absolutely rampant.
[02:54:13.988 --> 02:54:15.809]  I do know groups and people here in Austin.
[02:54:15.829 --> 02:54:20.613]  I don't have their phone numbers and info in front of me, but you can listen to the local station.
[02:54:20.653 --> 02:54:27.098]  I know a lot of those individuals are on the air, but ma'am, just do the research.
[02:54:27.158 --> 02:54:28.299]  I don't have it in front of me.
[02:54:29.048 --> 02:54:44.875]  Well, I mean, what's a person to do to keep from being tried in absentia and just picked up and taken to jail for the rest of their life and or sent to a mental institution for the criminally insane when they plant evidence in my apartment?
[02:54:45.315 --> 02:54:47.356]  I don't have the information in front of me, ma'am.
[02:54:47.416 --> 02:54:48.676]  It's a complex issue.
[02:54:49.077 --> 02:54:49.537]  You'll have to...
[02:54:51.246 --> 02:54:52.487]  Just listen to the local station.
[02:54:52.507 --> 02:54:54.628]  There's a lot of local people on talking about those issues.
[02:54:54.648 --> 02:54:54.988]  Okay.
[02:54:55.008 --> 02:54:58.750]  Do you want to give me a number, AM or FM?
[02:54:59.190 --> 02:54:59.590]  No, I don't.
[02:54:59.811 --> 02:55:00.831]  The station you're listening to.
[02:55:00.851 --> 02:55:01.751]  Okay.
[02:55:02.112 --> 02:55:03.012]  Thank you for the call.
[02:55:03.512 --> 02:55:08.895]  And all I can say to you is, I mean, we could spend an hour on your case.
[02:55:09.115 --> 02:55:10.216]  I don't know the particulars.
[02:55:10.776 --> 02:55:12.057]  I don't have the phone numbers in front of me.
[02:55:12.437 --> 02:55:14.878]  Jeffrey in Missouri, you're on the air.
[02:55:14.918 --> 02:55:15.318]  Go ahead.
[02:55:15.438 --> 02:55:16.519]  Good afternoon, Mr. Jones.
[02:55:16.659 --> 02:55:16.859]  Alex.
[02:55:17.409 --> 02:55:17.749]  Hello?
[02:55:17.969 --> 02:55:23.711]  I'd just like to point out yesterday's Kansas City Star, a Kansas City reporter, had an article on the front page.
[02:55:25.011 --> 02:55:28.192]  And the title is, Going the Distance Would Add to Tax Bill.
[02:55:28.872 --> 02:55:36.635]  And as I read the article, it talks about California and Oregon taxing the mileage a person drives in the state.
[02:55:37.335 --> 02:55:41.456]  Not differentiating whether or not it's a gas hog or not, just how many miles they drive.
[02:55:41.876 --> 02:55:44.797]  But the article states that they're not getting enough money from the
[02:55:45.768 --> 02:55:48.730]  By the way, they have record amounts of fuel being used.
[02:55:48.790 --> 02:55:49.651]  It's a total fraud.
[02:55:49.671 --> 02:55:52.092]  And yes, I'm sure the article tells you how great it is.
[02:55:52.532 --> 02:55:55.354]  Well, it also points out a new hate group.
[02:55:56.175 --> 02:56:05.241]  At the last paragraph, it says, at some point, Deacon said, people are going to say, how long can we let these other vehicles drive on the same road and pay less?
[02:56:07.002 --> 02:56:08.443]  So they're making a new class of people.
[02:56:08.463 --> 02:56:11.224]  There are people who drive fuel-efficient cars and those that drive gas-bombs.
[02:56:11.284 --> 02:56:13.586]  And they're blaming the fuel-efficient cars for...
[02:56:14.133 --> 02:56:17.296]  Not contributing their fair share to the gallon per gas.
[02:56:17.796 --> 02:56:19.018]  Look, they have plenty of money.
[02:56:19.038 --> 02:56:23.301]  It's been the federal plan for a decade, public for six years.
[02:56:23.622 --> 02:56:25.223]  They're going to do it, unless we say no.
[02:56:25.443 --> 02:56:27.325]  I just want to tell you, Alex, you're a visionary.
[02:56:27.345 --> 02:56:28.546]  You talked about this before.
[02:56:28.746 --> 02:56:30.008]  Oh, I'm not really a visionary.
[02:56:30.228 --> 02:56:32.009]  Hey, thank you for starting all the other callers.
[02:56:32.069 --> 02:56:33.150]  Back tonight, back tomorrow.
[02:56:33.311 --> 02:56:33.671]  Take care.
