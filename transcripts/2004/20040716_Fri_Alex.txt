[00:00:05.986 --> 00:00:06.647]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.287 --> 00:00:08.368]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.068 --> 00:00:10.189]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.650]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.411 --> 00:00:13.292]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.972 --> 00:00:17.915]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.155 --> 00:00:22.278]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.358 --> 00:00:23.719]  Music
[00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.124]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:35.586 --> 00:00:39.051]  Here we are on this live Friday edition.
[00:00:40.934 --> 00:00:42.697]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:00:43.558 --> 00:00:46.482]  Hard to believe another week has blasted past us.
[00:00:48.835 --> 00:00:58.402]  Why we've got the government talking about the terrorists might want to upset our electoral process, so the government's going to go ahead and upset the electoral process.
[00:00:58.422 --> 00:01:04.487]  You know, the terrorists attack us because they hate our freedom, so the government's going to take our freedom.
[00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:14.014]  And so we are accelerating towards the election and the government saying that there will be terror attacks.
[00:01:14.054 --> 00:01:15.295]  That's what they've been telling the press.
[00:01:16.095 --> 00:01:25.742]  This is meant to confuse us and to get us to come to the government as our savior, when in truth it is those elements controlling the government that are carrying out the attacks, and we've proven that up one side and down the other.
[00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.091]  I got an email yesterday, and I was trying to find it before the show.
[00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:50.491]  It's in this big stack over here, a ridiculously large stack.
[00:01:51.572 --> 00:02:06.375]  And the guy says, I'm a young law enforcement officer, 20 years old, and I don't agree with you and what you think about conspiracies and this new world order.
[00:02:08.015 --> 00:02:08.916]  I don't want to paraphrase.
[00:02:08.956 --> 00:02:10.136]  I want to find the email.
[00:02:12.904 --> 00:02:15.905]  But folks, it's not a conspiracy theory.
[00:02:15.985 --> 00:02:18.006]  The world government is here.
[00:02:18.646 --> 00:02:19.827]  They're announcing it.
[00:02:20.687 --> 00:02:21.907]  It's taking over.
[00:02:22.147 --> 00:02:25.389]  It's selecting John Edwards as the VP.
[00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:29.150]  You know, the New York Times comes out and talks about the Bilderberg Group.
[00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.153]  So you guys are still behind the curve, waking up to this and figuring this out.
[00:02:36.173 --> 00:02:37.093]  At least some of you are.
[00:02:38.047 --> 00:02:48.437]  I mean, I know that some of the big neocon talk show hosts still say the CFR doesn't exist, and the Bilderberg Group doesn't exist, and if you think the UN's trying to take over, you're a nutcase.
[00:02:49.338 --> 00:02:56.485]  Well, of course the globalists are going to have their minions acting like conservatives, trying to pacify real conservatives.
[00:02:57.186 --> 00:02:59.909]  And so a big part of our job is getting you to wake up.
[00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.462]  We're going to take a lot of calls today, early in this first hour and throughout the broadcast.
[00:03:06.482 --> 00:03:13.626]  If you have a question, a comment, a news item you want to discuss, if you disagree with me, you go to the front of the line.
[00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:18.469]  If you agree, you just stay right there and we go to you in order.
[00:03:19.338 --> 00:03:23.919]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:24.359]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:26.539]  Some of the news coming up.
[00:03:26.619 --> 00:03:28.780]  This is out of the London Independent.
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.040]  It's also in the Associated Press.
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.861]  Secret film shows Iraqi prisoners being sodomized.
[00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:35.341]  Now, what the government did is they released...
[00:03:47.404 --> 00:03:52.928]  Some of the lighter photographs three months ago, that got all the focus.
[00:03:54.309 --> 00:04:00.173]  Then somebody cut Berg's head off, and then that legitimized the torture in everybody's minds.
[00:04:00.733 --> 00:04:04.716]  And then all of the really damning news came out right after that.
[00:04:06.437 --> 00:04:13.342]  Now, long before Berg got his head cut off, Congress had seen the thousands of photos and hundreds of videos.
[00:04:14.302 --> 00:04:16.024]  Or at least the CIA gave them...
[00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:20.167]  What, I think three hours to go look at it.
[00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:24.731]  And most members of Congress said they didn't want to see it.
[00:04:27.633 --> 00:04:30.395]  I guess so they don't have responsibility to stand up to what's happened.
[00:04:30.495 --> 00:04:31.956]  Or I wouldn't blame some people.
[00:04:32.056 --> 00:04:34.698]  I mean, who wants to see stuff like that?
[00:04:35.739 --> 00:04:37.740]  And I imagine some members of Congress probably do.
[00:04:38.861 --> 00:04:40.762]  With the background some of these people have.
[00:04:40.882 --> 00:04:42.624]  But the point is, is that now...
[00:04:43.687 --> 00:04:47.549]  Everybody is just focused on what first came out, not all the new stuff.
[00:04:48.369 --> 00:04:51.010]  And it is horrific, to say the least.
[00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.632]  We'll go over that and just a bunch of other key news when we get back.
[00:04:54.712 --> 00:04:56.353]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the website.
[00:05:03.951 --> 00:05:09.434]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.855 --> 00:05:14.097]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:14.317 --> 00:05:21.361]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.742 --> 00:05:27.845]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.985 --> 00:05:29.206]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:29.866]  We're good to go.
[00:05:46.318 --> 00:05:49.460]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.580]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.740]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.841 --> 00:05:50.761]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:50.781 --> 00:05:50.981]  Call today.
[00:06:01.522 --> 00:06:02.142]  Hello, folks.
[00:06:02.242 --> 00:06:03.123]  Alex Jones here.
[00:06:03.283 --> 00:06:07.405]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:06:07.525 --> 00:06:10.406]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:06:10.486 --> 00:06:17.210]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:20.391]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:06:20.591 --> 00:06:22.993]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:06:23.113 --> 00:06:27.835]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[00:06:28.015 --> 00:06:33.296]  Try halomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform.
[00:06:33.456 --> 00:06:34.217]  MTBE.
[00:06:34.437 --> 00:06:35.237]  Radon 222.
[00:06:35.337 --> 00:06:37.317]  Foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur.
[00:06:37.477 --> 00:06:38.298]  Even nitrates.
[00:06:38.598 --> 00:06:42.599]  And unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:49.420]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:06:53.582 --> 00:06:53.662]  803-4438.
[00:06:53.722 --> 00:06:55.043]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:06:55.483 --> 00:06:59.406]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:07:00.826 --> 00:07:05.169]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:09.692]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:12.312 --> 00:07:14.314]  This disaster is a new world order.
[00:07:14.395 --> 00:07:17.198]  A new world order can emerge.
[00:07:17.478 --> 00:07:21.684]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.744 --> 00:07:28.692]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.812 --> 00:07:30.835]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:31.055 --> 00:07:41.601]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:47.184]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:07:47.684 --> 00:07:50.346]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[00:07:50.446 --> 00:07:51.466]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.506 --> 00:07:51.867]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.947 --> 00:07:53.988]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:08:01.255 --> 00:08:06.298]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:06.658 --> 00:08:08.980]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:17.986]  You know, I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[00:08:19.026 --> 00:08:20.847]  We're going to have wide open phones today.
[00:08:20.887 --> 00:08:21.688]  It is Friday.
[00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:24.459]  The 16th day of July, 2004.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.640]  And again, thank you for joining us.
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.221]  The toll-free number to get involved on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:30.241 --> 00:08:30.581]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:30.601 --> 00:08:32.782]  Well, I checked the news wires this morning.
[00:08:32.862 --> 00:08:38.363]  Nothing about world leaders congregating in Northern California for the Bohemian Grove Massacre.
[00:08:49.815 --> 00:09:10.485]  Luciferian rituals attended by many of our so-called Christian conservative leaders, but usually a report or two does surface in the Sacramento Bee or the San Francisco Chronicle or the Santa Rosa Press Democrat or the little Monterio Bohemian.
[00:09:10.505 --> 00:09:12.166]  They have a newspaper called the Bohemian.
[00:09:13.263 --> 00:09:15.865]  So we're watching for that here in the next few days.
[00:09:15.925 --> 00:09:21.589]  I'll tell you if there were any developments at the 132nd annual meeting out there.
[00:09:21.689 --> 00:09:26.793]  Presidents have been attending since the turn of the last century, or for about 104 years.
[00:09:27.994 --> 00:09:31.736]  And I snuck in four years ago, and I went over some of that story yesterday.
[00:09:31.756 --> 00:09:38.241]  If I have time, I'll read that last page in my little article I wrote a few years ago about the ritual itself later.
[00:09:39.442 --> 00:09:42.584]  Yes, truth is stranger than fiction, and this stuff is really going on
[00:09:43.824 --> 00:09:45.285]  Toll-free number to join us again, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:09:45.666 --> 00:09:49.589]  Here's some of the news.
[00:09:49.669 --> 00:09:52.351]  Secret film shows Iraqi prisoners sodomized.
[00:09:54.413 --> 00:09:57.676]  China bans abortion based on baby's gender.
[00:09:58.997 --> 00:09:59.918]  Report U.S.
[00:09:59.958 --> 00:10:04.582]  cancels air passenger screening upgrade program.
[00:10:04.602 --> 00:10:05.823]  That's not really true.
[00:10:06.443 --> 00:10:10.687]  Largest simulated terror attack ever to be carried out.
[00:10:11.917 --> 00:10:13.218]  We'll go over that report.
[00:10:13.998 --> 00:10:17.120]  Where one of our stations is based, we're on in Kansas City.
[00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:21.923]  The tower itself is in a suburb, Independence, Missouri.
[00:10:24.425 --> 00:10:37.553]  And here is an article, and it says, Independence Police stage roadblock to check driver's license, and it says they've arrested 1,300 people for not having their driver's license with them.
[00:10:38.812 --> 00:10:46.818]  And they admit it's not to stop drunks, it's not to look for terrorists, it's not to look for the abominable snowman like they normally say it is.
[00:10:47.539 --> 00:10:51.662]  No, it's just randomly stopping all the cars on major roads and searching them while they're at it.
[00:10:52.142 --> 00:10:58.066]  Total violation of the Fourth Amendment, guilty until proven innocent, total destruction of America in your face.
[00:10:58.086 --> 00:11:01.729]  And I see these reports every single week around the country.
[00:11:03.306 --> 00:11:05.347]  Also, I've got some listener email I want to read.
[00:11:06.067 --> 00:11:16.730]  More on Florida citizens to help catch terrorists that you read into the article, and it says, and to fight crime, and every type of repairman, you name it, will be snooping on you.
[00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:22.431]  More developments with the chip implanted in Mexico judicial workers.
[00:11:24.072 --> 00:11:28.353]  You've got to have it to get into the justice building area with the computers.
[00:11:29.393 --> 00:11:32.874]  It's just 160 to begin where they want to make the police take it now.
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.505]  And Soylent Green, milk and coffee produced from blood.
[00:11:37.525 --> 00:11:38.767]  Yeah.
[00:11:39.328 --> 00:11:43.814]  Also, guns worn in open, legal but alarm Virginia.
[00:11:44.315 --> 00:11:45.737]  This is out of the Washington Post.
[00:11:47.038 --> 00:11:49.221]  Fairfax County Police received a 9-11 call from a...
[00:11:51.736 --> 00:11:54.777]  Champs Restaurant in Reston.
[00:11:54.837 --> 00:11:56.637]  Six men are seated at a table.
[00:11:56.677 --> 00:11:58.258]  The caller said they're all armed.
[00:11:58.678 --> 00:12:00.779]  The dispatchers quickly sent four officers to the scene.
[00:12:01.099 --> 00:12:08.141]  The officers were extremely polite and were hoping that some of the men were in law enforcement, said Sergeant Richard Perez.
[00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:10.682]  Why is it okay for you to have guns but not us?
[00:12:10.842 --> 00:12:11.062]  Huh?
[00:12:11.322 --> 00:12:12.142]  You think you own us?
[00:12:12.222 --> 00:12:12.442]  Huh?
[00:12:13.222 --> 00:12:15.483]  A spokesman from the police department...
[00:12:16.261 --> 00:12:18.623]  Said none were law enforcement.
[00:12:18.643 --> 00:12:22.105]  The men told the officers they were just exercising their rights.
[00:12:22.546 --> 00:12:23.507]  Let's cover this now.
[00:12:24.467 --> 00:12:27.249]  Then I'll go to calls and all the other news I just mentioned.
[00:12:30.772 --> 00:12:31.292]  Listen to this.
[00:12:32.934 --> 00:12:37.477]  Turns out, packing a pistol in public is perfectly legal in Virginia.
[00:12:38.354 --> 00:12:49.849]  And three times in the last month, including at Champs on Sunset Hills Road, residents have been spotted out and about in the county with guns strapped to their hips, exercising that right.
[00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.034]  Now before you make up your mind out there about this, just listen to me, okay?
[00:12:54.355 --> 00:12:55.276]  Let's finish the article.
[00:12:55.945 --> 00:13:03.870]  In the first episode at a Starbucks, Fairfax police wrongfully confiscated weapons from two college students and charged them with a misdemeanor.
[00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:08.372]  Police realized their mistake, returned the guns, and tore up the charges the next day.
[00:13:09.933 --> 00:13:12.575]  That's wrongful arrest, official oppression.
[00:13:13.195 --> 00:13:16.017]  Those college students can own your house and your jet ski, buddy.
[00:13:16.797 --> 00:13:18.498]  And you do that to me, I will.
[00:13:18.518 --> 00:13:20.659]  Of course, we don't have that in Texas anymore.
[00:13:20.699 --> 00:13:22.320]  We don't have a Second Amendment here anymore.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.102]  So, actually, I better not walk around with a gun strapped to me.
[00:13:26.631 --> 00:13:33.934]  Police commanders have since issued a reminder to officers that open carry is the law of the land in the Old Dominion.
[00:13:34.874 --> 00:13:45.197]  Philip Van Cleve, president of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, an organization of thousands of Virginia gun owners and members, were involved in all three police encounters.
[00:13:45.737 --> 00:13:47.878]  I've got to get Philip Van Cleve on.
[00:13:47.918 --> 00:13:48.838]  You are awesome.
[00:13:49.659 --> 00:13:50.699]  You are unbelievable.
[00:13:52.571 --> 00:13:57.741]  Oh, but he said there was no coordinated campaign to start packing heat publicly.
[00:13:58.843 --> 00:14:01.448]  It was probably more of a coincidence, but not completely.
[00:14:01.488 --> 00:14:02.951]  Van Cleef said nothing that...
[00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:09.157]  The word of the improper or confiscation spread quickly among members through email.
[00:14:09.177 --> 00:14:11.699]  This is a good opportunity to educate people.
[00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:15.522]  We have this inherent right, and not many people exercise it.
[00:14:15.862 --> 00:14:22.047]  In Virginia, as in many states, carrying a concealed weapon requires a permit issued by a local court.
[00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:28.353]  But no permit is required to simply wield a gun in the open, a right reinforced by state law that took effect July 1st,
[00:14:29.253 --> 00:14:33.817]  Not so in the District of Maryland unless you're police or federal officer.
[00:14:34.697 --> 00:14:40.021]  Fairfax police are baffled by the sudden display of weaponry, but assume it was done to make some sort of statement.
[00:14:41.002 --> 00:14:48.127]  Crime is at 20-year lows in the county, Lieutenant Colonel Charles K. Peters pointed out, even though the population is soaring.
[00:14:48.567 --> 00:14:56.553]  The country's homicide rate was the lowest, the county's homicide rate was the lowest in the nation last year among the 32.
[00:14:59.685 --> 00:15:00.886]  Largest jurisdictions.
[00:15:00.946 --> 00:15:05.489]  Hopefully no one feels the need to carry a gun, lawfully or unlawfully, Peter said.
[00:15:05.849 --> 00:15:20.518]  But there's no question it is lawful to carry a gun on the street, so we've had to ensure that all of our officers are updated on the nuisance of Virginia law that allows citizens to carry firearms in public places.
[00:15:20.538 --> 00:15:24.560]  So you think the law is a nuisance, huh, boy?
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.862]  Although legal, it is...
[00:15:27.586 --> 00:15:29.268]  Disconcerting to some idiots.
[00:15:29.508 --> 00:15:30.369]  I mean, some people.
[00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:34.733]  And later I'll read the rest of this article, but I want to comment on it now.
[00:15:37.216 --> 00:15:39.178]  Funny, I talked about this, I think, on Monday.
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:51.270]  Just ten years ago in Texas, every other pickup, I don't want to exaggerate, every third or fourth pickup you saw, twenty years ago, was almost every pickup.
[00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:51.450]  Ha!
[00:15:52.429 --> 00:16:04.078]  But every two or three trucks you saw, one would have a .243 or .30-06 or .308 Remington or Winchester rifle in them.
[00:16:05.039 --> 00:16:08.341]  Now there's fishing poles and cowboy hats and baseball caps.
[00:16:08.762 --> 00:16:22.272]  Because, folks, if you stick a deer rifle, which is totally lawful, in the back of the window of your car, most of the time you're going to have guns to your head, you're going to have SWAT teams called, you're going to go to jail for something
[00:16:24.216 --> 00:16:37.601]  Now, the Texas law is you can have loaded rifles, shotguns, all hidden in your car and plain view in your car, and occasionally when I've had stalkers threatening me, I carry a loaded shotgun in my car.
[00:16:38.881 --> 00:16:39.882]  You never know when it's there.
[00:16:41.362 --> 00:16:45.924]  But the point here is that
[00:16:46.815 --> 00:17:06.899]  You don't want to carry it in view because the cops don't even know the law, and by the time you're on the ground and the fire ants and five cops are there, you know, somebody above 35 will show up who isn't on steroids and say, okay, let him go, but then usually they'll want to find something else on you or do something or claim you resisted them just because they don't like to be wrong.
[00:17:09.816 --> 00:17:19.079]  Now, up until they passed the horrible, evil, concealed carry payment, turning a right into a privilege in Texas, I don't know, was it six years ago?
[00:17:20.939 --> 00:17:30.022]  Up until the time they did that, you could, according to state law, buy a gun at the gun shop, drive it home, take it to the shooting range, but it was still a little foggy.
[00:17:30.962 --> 00:17:37.644]  Now, since they passed concealed carry, turning a right into a privilege, the law reads, and I've read it on air,
[00:17:39.122 --> 00:17:46.143]  That it's their discretion and it's illegal to buy a handgun and to drive the thing home.
[00:17:46.543 --> 00:17:48.144]  But again, it's not really enforced.
[00:17:48.184 --> 00:17:50.324]  It's selectively enforced.
[00:17:53.004 --> 00:18:06.347]  And back when this country, when a murder made national news, when it was a big deal, just 130 years ago or so, 120 years ago, violent offenders would leave prison and they would be given their guns back when they left.
[00:18:06.987 --> 00:18:08.247]  But everybody else had guns.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:18.523]  And crime has been dropping because of concealed carry, which, again, trains you that a right is a privilege, but allows people to still carry guns.
[00:18:19.344 --> 00:18:20.524]  And there's maps of this.
[00:18:20.724 --> 00:18:29.248]  All the states that have concealed carry for more than two years have a 14% to 22%, depending on the state, drop in violent crime.
[00:18:29.508 --> 00:18:30.888]  The carjackings end.
[00:18:31.709 --> 00:18:35.410]  The home invasions, while people are there, almost disappear.
[00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:38.131]  I mean, a thief's going to make darn sure you're gone.
[00:18:39.781 --> 00:18:41.422]  Because I'm going to put a couple holes in you.
[00:18:41.482 --> 00:18:42.563]  I'm going to air you out.
[00:18:43.063 --> 00:18:44.724]  I'm going to bust a cap in you as they say.
[00:18:44.744 --> 00:18:46.485]  If you come in my house, I will kill you.
[00:18:47.325 --> 00:18:48.186]  And that's my right.
[00:18:48.926 --> 00:18:50.107]  And everybody else knows that.
[00:18:50.908 --> 00:18:56.271]  And these states, now it's not just the criminals not going in the house.
[00:18:56.331 --> 00:18:58.292]  They're not messing with people's cars, folks.
[00:18:59.753 --> 00:19:01.634]  And so the crime rate has dropped through the floor.
[00:19:04.542 --> 00:19:05.782]  That doesn't bother the government.
[00:19:05.802 --> 00:19:09.843]  They just pass a bunch of new laws making nonviolent crimes more and more plentiful.
[00:19:11.103 --> 00:19:15.984]  But, you know, Vermont has a right to carry state.
[00:19:16.384 --> 00:19:17.665]  Arizona has this.
[00:19:18.785 --> 00:19:23.806]  And what we need to do is look at these states with such low crime rates where people do carry guns openly.
[00:19:24.926 --> 00:19:26.206]  And I think it's a good idea.
[00:19:27.446 --> 00:19:30.067]  I mean, these idiots that are so afraid of a gun
[00:19:31.024 --> 00:19:34.886]  They're not afraid of a repairman walking into your house with a nail gun, which will do the same thing.
[00:19:34.906 --> 00:19:37.847]  They're not afraid of you walking with a Louisville slugger.
[00:19:38.888 --> 00:19:44.670]  But this situation where people call the police on you is standard.
[00:19:45.771 --> 00:19:48.772]  I mean, again, they come in your house now and call the police on you if they see a gun.
[00:19:49.432 --> 00:19:53.794]  We'll come back, take calls, talk more about this and a bunch of other news items.
[00:19:55.995 --> 00:19:57.616]  It's the castration of America.
[00:20:01.866 --> 00:20:12.612]  The Berkey Light's unique design combines the age-old process of microporous filtration coupled with modern, state-of-the-art technology and the highest quality materials, bringing you the finest water filter available anywhere.
[00:20:12.792 --> 00:20:20.357]  The revolutionary Berkey Light, with its exclusive black Berkey filter elements, remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:20:20.597 --> 00:20:23.779]  Farmful or unwanted chemicals are reduced to below detectable levels.
[00:20:23.899 --> 00:20:24.299]  We're good to go.
[00:20:42.597 --> 00:20:48.541]  The rechargeable LED lighting system is beautiful as a nightlight and as necessary in emergency situations.
[00:20:48.761 --> 00:20:53.023]  Get the Berkey Light, the transparent water filter, for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:20:53.043 --> 00:20:53.504]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:21:01.589 --> 00:21:03.130]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:04.411]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:21:04.611 --> 00:21:08.014]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:21:08.114 --> 00:21:08.535]  Phenol.
[00:21:08.855 --> 00:21:15.941]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:21:16.281 --> 00:21:20.362]  EDTA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:21:20.482 --> 00:21:20.942]  Fragrance?
[00:21:21.302 --> 00:21:26.063]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:21:26.203 --> 00:21:30.884]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:21:31.104 --> 00:21:33.665]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:21:33.925 --> 00:21:37.345]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:21:37.485 --> 00:21:40.986]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:21:41.226 --> 00:21:43.589]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:21:43.749 --> 00:21:44.650]  So what are you waiting for?

[00:22:01.778 --> 00:22:06.500]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:10.161]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[00:22:10.381 --> 00:22:12.862]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[00:22:13.102 --> 00:22:21.685]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[00:22:22.045 --> 00:22:27.807]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.
[00:22:28.107 --> 00:22:30.047]  Chapman's predictions are legendary.

[00:22:44.290 --> 00:22:44.771]  That's right.

[00:23:02.356 --> 00:23:03.336]  It's finally here.
[00:23:03.476 --> 00:23:04.457]  Spring has arrived.
[00:23:04.657 --> 00:23:07.618]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[00:23:07.838 --> 00:23:11.279]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[00:23:11.499 --> 00:23:19.662]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[00:23:19.922 --> 00:23:23.643]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[00:23:23.863 --> 00:23:28.865]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[00:23:29.165 --> 00:23:33.666]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[00:23:33.846 --> 00:23:37.928]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[00:23:38.008 --> 00:23:45.130]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce, and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:50.894]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.

[00:23:54.616 --> 00:23:55.496]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:23:55.516 --> 00:23:56.577]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:14.873 --> 00:24:22.116]  Alright, I want to read the rest of this Washington Post article where these people are freaking out over citizens wearing guns openly.
[00:24:23.697 --> 00:24:24.598]  What's the difference?
[00:24:24.698 --> 00:24:25.638]  The police do it.
[00:24:26.318 --> 00:24:28.239]  Oh, but they've got proper training in there.
[00:24:28.299 --> 00:24:29.080]  Blah, blah, blah.
[00:24:29.940 --> 00:24:32.681]  Again, this freaks these people out so bad.
[00:24:32.701 --> 00:24:40.545]  You know, we have places like Kennesaw, Georgia that back in the late 80s had a high crime rate.
[00:24:40.625 --> 00:24:42.986]  So they said, okay, everyone has to own a gun.
[00:24:44.136 --> 00:24:49.378]  And the crime rate, and this is the government's own numbers, dropped in one year by 92%.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:25:03.365]  Every criminal pulled up stakes and fled just because the government said, hey, we're not going to harass you or be mean to you if you carry guns or have them in your house.
[00:25:03.425 --> 00:25:09.168]  And so people started doing it in Kennesaw, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta, and the crime rate plummeted.
[00:25:09.848 --> 00:25:11.249]  Look, you cannot ignore the facts.
[00:25:11.409 --> 00:25:12.189]  New York City.
[00:25:13.095 --> 00:25:18.198]  Has a total gun ban, unless you pay off the sheriff $20,000, and then he'll give you a permit if you're a mobster.
[00:25:18.658 --> 00:25:20.639]  Literally, it's just mobsters and criminals that have permits.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:24.121]  And they have one of the highest crime rates in the country.
[00:25:24.161 --> 00:25:25.421]  Chicago, same thing.
[00:25:25.721 --> 00:25:28.003]  L.A., banning most guns and ammo.
[00:25:28.263 --> 00:25:29.063]  Horrible crime.
[00:25:30.524 --> 00:25:35.406]  I mean, I can't imagine what it would be like sleeping at night in my home without a gun.
[00:25:36.847 --> 00:25:38.148]  And it's not that I live in fear.
[00:25:38.188 --> 00:25:40.369]  It's that I live in security and manliness.
[00:25:42.924 --> 00:25:45.545]  And carry out my duty to protect my family.
[00:25:46.645 --> 00:25:50.187]  You go, manliness, oh, you need the gun to be tough and strong.
[00:25:50.307 --> 00:25:50.667]  No!
[00:25:51.587 --> 00:25:53.868]  The point is, it's my right as a free man.
[00:25:54.648 --> 00:25:55.989]  Slaves can't own guns.
[00:25:56.569 --> 00:26:00.611]  It's my right, fought for by veterans and my ancestors and your ancestors.
[00:26:01.171 --> 00:26:04.172]  And it's a sacred right and a duty and an honor.
[00:26:04.712 --> 00:26:09.374]  And by having that gun, I frustrate criminals all over my neighborhood.
[00:26:10.115 --> 00:26:10.775]  And so do you.
[00:26:11.522 --> 00:26:12.503]  Because they know.
[00:26:13.103 --> 00:26:16.426]  Even you cowards that don't like guns and are afraid of them and don't want them.
[00:26:17.166 --> 00:26:21.449]  Well, rest assured, you're safe at night because your neighbor's got guns.
[00:26:21.649 --> 00:26:23.491]  And because that cop's got a gun.
[00:26:24.311 --> 00:26:25.833]  The more guns, the better.
[00:26:27.334 --> 00:26:29.876]  And you'll pull out your little mothball statistics about Europe.
[00:26:30.276 --> 00:26:31.557]  You know, England banned the guns.
[00:26:31.997 --> 00:26:34.459]  Back when they had a low crime rate, people had guns.
[00:26:34.479 --> 00:26:34.919]  You know that?
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:39.923]  The crime rate has exploded there past the United States in violent crime.
[00:26:40.771 --> 00:26:52.519]  We still are a little bit above them in murders per capita, but violent crime itself, being knocked on the head, being robbed, being... Yeah, I said I'd go to calls, and I'm... This is just out of control.
[00:26:53.319 --> 00:27:03.986]  It's so alien to people that someone would carry a gun on the street, and it's the law, and the cops are in this article going, I don't care if it's the law, I just want to arrest them!
[00:27:04.607 --> 00:27:06.088]  We've got to do something about this!
[00:27:07.068 --> 00:27:08.268]  What's wrong with you guys?
[00:27:08.308 --> 00:27:10.509]  Don't you know it makes you safer yourselves?
[00:27:11.850 --> 00:27:14.090]  But you like the monopoly of that power, don't you?
[00:27:14.130 --> 00:27:21.993]  As the UN says, civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate, I say it's illegitimate, power monopoly of the state.
[00:27:22.193 --> 00:27:23.634]  A power monopoly is a dictatorship.
[00:27:24.314 --> 00:27:25.314]  You like the power.
[00:27:26.094 --> 00:27:26.595]  You like it.
[00:27:27.075 --> 00:27:32.136]  And in areas where they've got gun control, they're now banning old ladies having stun guns in their houses.
[00:27:32.877 --> 00:27:33.657]  Taser guns.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.181]  And they said in the articles, well, this could threaten an officer.
[00:27:37.221 --> 00:27:38.442]  It could, conceivably.
[00:27:39.302 --> 00:27:41.964]  And we just don't like citizens having things like this.
[00:27:44.125 --> 00:27:47.026]  I mean, okay, cops, hey, you go out on the beat without your gun.
[00:27:47.687 --> 00:27:49.287]  And then see how you're making us feel.
[00:27:49.627 --> 00:27:50.668]  Well, you don't need a gun.
[00:27:50.708 --> 00:27:51.328]  You've got us.
[00:27:51.348 --> 00:27:51.869]  9-1-1.
[00:27:52.969 --> 00:27:54.190]  What's the national average?
[00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.370]  Like...
[00:27:58.055 --> 00:27:58.936]  Fourteen minutes?
[00:27:59.736 --> 00:28:05.381]  Somebody on cocaine and LSD is busting through my door?
[00:28:05.401 --> 00:28:17.110]  I mean, there's been all these cases and nutcases with pitchforks killing people's children, but the guns are locked up so they can't get to the safe to get them?
[00:28:18.311 --> 00:28:18.591]  No!
[00:28:18.611 --> 00:28:18.651]  No!
[00:28:19.702 --> 00:28:24.686]  And so if you or any other criminal ever tries to take my guns, you know, that's when we have a 1776.
[00:28:26.667 --> 00:28:29.950]  Because, folks, Hitler was for gun control.
[00:28:30.690 --> 00:28:31.851]  Get it through your little heads.
[00:28:31.891 --> 00:28:32.892]  I mean, all these liberals.
[00:28:34.173 --> 00:28:44.461]  Oh, there's tyranny, martial law, Bush is preparing for tyranny and martial law and a military coup, and it's horrible, and it is Nazi Germany.
[00:28:44.501 --> 00:28:46.162]  Let's turn our guns into the government.
[00:28:46.522 --> 00:28:47.303]  That's the answer.
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:53.823]  It's like telling Geronimo, the answer is, Geronimo, turn your rifles in.
[00:28:54.984 --> 00:28:57.105]  Not get more rifles, Geronimo.
[00:28:57.125 --> 00:29:01.087]  Or it's like telling George Washington, the king's been being mean to you.
[00:29:01.147 --> 00:29:08.431]  Just when they come to take your guns at Lexington and Concord, go ahead and give them to them, because it's the government, and they say turn them in.
[00:29:08.451 --> 00:29:17.496]  All right, I promise, as soon as we come back out of break, I won't get into any more of this until later, and we'll go to Linda and Tim and David and Keith and Gary and everybody else.
[00:29:19.361 --> 00:29:28.928]  And again, the websites are prisonplanet.com, infowars.com, that's infowars.com, and prisonplanet.tv.
[00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:33.691]  So stay with us, and we'll come back and go to calls.
[00:29:33.711 --> 00:29:36.313]  Then we'll get to U.S.
[00:29:36.373 --> 00:29:47.341]  government in possession of hundreds of videos and thousands of photos of the CIA contractors ordering the troops to rape children.
[00:29:47.801 --> 00:29:48.822]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.784 --> 00:29:52.745]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.185 --> 00:29:54.787]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.807 --> 00:29:58.470]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:03.435 --> 00:30:07.759]  Just once, I'd like to clean my car's leather upholstery without sliding across the seat on every turn.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.844]  Just once, I'd like to get a beautiful shine without a slick, oily residue that attracts dust and dirt.
[00:30:13.424 --> 00:30:16.407]  Introducing just once the amazing non-slip protectant.

[00:32:01.589 --> 00:32:06.013]  Stop paying over $2 an ounce for fresh wheatgrass juice at your local juice bar.
[00:32:06.333 --> 00:32:11.678]  Did you know you can grow and juice your own fresh, healthy wheatgrass in your own kitchen for only pennies an ounce?
[00:32:12.118 --> 00:32:13.379]  It doesn't take much space.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:20.145]  Just a small area of countertop, windowsill, or porch, and you can have fresh, jucible wheatgrass in only 10 days.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:21.080]  We're good to go.
[00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:41.270]  That's 801-375-2250.
[00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:42.011]  Wheatgrasskits.com.
[00:33:02.027 --> 00:33:07.629]  All right, the last 20 minutes or so, I've been getting into this Washington Post article.
[00:33:07.709 --> 00:33:09.710]  Guns worn in open, legal, but alarm Virginia.
[00:33:09.790 --> 00:33:11.810]  And the police don't like it, and...
[00:33:26.641 --> 00:33:32.265]  They had to pass a law simply stating that the state constitution does say you can carry a gun openly.
[00:33:33.185 --> 00:33:37.148]  There have always been laws in this country against carrying concealed weapons.
[00:33:37.168 --> 00:33:44.413]  So they play a trick and say, oh, you can have concealed carry because that brings you into the common law.
[00:33:44.853 --> 00:33:50.637]  That goes back to, you know, sneaks and thieves and killers wore swords and daggers under their cloaks.
[00:33:51.317 --> 00:33:53.779]  Shaking hands was a way of saying, I don't have a weapon.
[00:33:55.057 --> 00:34:00.600]  That's where that ancient greeting, or I don't have a weapon in my hand, it's openly born.
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:07.963]  And imagine a society where on any given day, 10% of people were wearing firearms.
[00:34:08.023 --> 00:34:10.744]  It's also a very polite society.
[00:34:12.005 --> 00:34:15.806]  And crime is almost non-existent in those societies.
[00:34:17.867 --> 00:34:22.990]  But for police that can't get this through their heads, how about you don't carry a gun anymore?
[00:34:23.110 --> 00:34:23.850]  Just go out and
[00:34:25.416 --> 00:34:28.397]  Deal with all the criminals and nutcases and drug addicts without your gun.
[00:34:30.338 --> 00:34:31.658]  Oh, you wouldn't think of it for a minute.
[00:34:32.659 --> 00:34:37.581]  And see, once you retire then, a lot of times you guys end up going to jail for having a gun.
[00:34:37.921 --> 00:34:44.863]  No matter how many stickers you got on the back of your car saying, you know, retired Oklahoma or Texas or New York police officer.
[00:34:45.564 --> 00:34:52.787]  So the feds are trying to pass laws at state level which say that you get to keep your guns after you retire, so you'll come grab ours.
[00:34:53.407 --> 00:34:53.807]  Stop it!
[00:34:55.208 --> 00:34:55.628]  Stop it.
[00:34:56.488 --> 00:34:57.229]  It's ridiculous.
[00:34:59.589 --> 00:35:12.513]  But we've gone so far to the point of, again, ten years ago in Texas, every third or fourth pickup truck had a gun in the back, and no one thought anything of it.
[00:35:12.993 --> 00:35:19.195]  Now, again, you see fishing poles and cowboy hats because you don't want to get SWAT teamed.
[00:35:19.753 --> 00:35:29.183]  Because idiots will call the police on you because they think guns are illegal because they watch all these TV drama shows based in New York where, got any guns in the car?
[00:35:29.203 --> 00:35:30.284]  You're not allowed to have this gun.
[00:35:30.324 --> 00:35:31.005]  I'm arresting you.
[00:35:31.305 --> 00:35:38.293]  And these fools watch shows supposedly based in New York or Chicago or they even watch the news showing arrests in those cities, in those states.
[00:35:39.361 --> 00:35:43.184]  In areas that have all this gun control, and they think, my gosh, that's the rest of the country.
[00:35:43.565 --> 00:35:50.630]  So then when I've got a carpet cleaner at my house who sees a shotgun in the case on the wall, he thinks it's illegal and runs off to call the police.
[00:35:54.453 --> 00:36:04.461]  So this is a perception war, and it's really freaking them out when people do in states where you can have guns openly, where the Second Amendment still is in force, and it's...
[00:36:06.352 --> 00:36:08.153]  It's a battle of perception.
[00:36:08.513 --> 00:36:09.494]  All right, thanks for holding.
[00:36:09.514 --> 00:36:10.255]  Let's go to the calls.
[00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:11.695]  Linda in Missouri.
[00:36:11.735 --> 00:36:12.356]  Go ahead, Linda.
[00:36:12.696 --> 00:36:13.136]  Good morning.
[00:36:13.436 --> 00:36:13.757]  Hello.
[00:36:15.298 --> 00:36:20.501]  I'd like to call the nation's attention to Congressman Ron Paul's weekly report.
[00:36:22.082 --> 00:36:22.982]  It's a heads-up.
[00:36:25.104 --> 00:36:26.424]  I call it a warning.
[00:36:27.485 --> 00:36:30.067]  Okay, I didn't hear his weekly report this week.
[00:36:30.087 --> 00:36:30.787]  What's he talk about?
[00:36:30.807 --> 00:36:32.468]  He's talking about a 24-page census...
[00:36:35.554 --> 00:36:41.156]  24 pages long with a $1,000 fine per question if you don't answer.
[00:36:42.616 --> 00:36:45.857]  Well, what's the toll-free number to call the legislative line?
[00:36:46.357 --> 00:36:48.398]  Okay, the toll-free number is 1-888-322-1414.
[00:36:56.792 --> 00:37:02.595]  Yeah, in the past, we have aired these on the show, and I'll tell you what we'll do.
[00:37:02.655 --> 00:37:03.235]  We'll go ahead.
[00:37:03.275 --> 00:37:06.057]  It's about, what, a two-minute legislative update, or how long is this week's?
[00:37:07.338 --> 00:37:16.603]  I didn't time it, but the important thing that your listeners need to do for you and me and everyone else is to find the bill number.
[00:37:17.563 --> 00:37:18.043]  Okay.
[00:37:18.444 --> 00:37:19.284]  Linda, anything else?
[00:37:19.784 --> 00:37:24.587]  Well, I consider this a citizen dossier for the Gestapo.
[00:37:25.459 --> 00:37:31.202]  Well, in 2000, one in six homes got a 51-question survey.
[00:37:31.242 --> 00:37:32.823]  I happen to be unlucky enough to get that.
[00:37:33.904 --> 00:37:35.865]  And others got the five-question one.
[00:37:36.485 --> 00:37:45.070]  And according to federal law, and Leviticus, where it comes from, with Moses, then the 1214 Magna Carta, it is to number for...
[00:37:46.151 --> 00:37:49.714]  Legislative apportionment, how many House members the state gets.
[00:37:50.054 --> 00:37:52.016]  They are to ask how many people live here, that's it.
[00:37:52.876 --> 00:37:59.541]  But they said in 2000 that we're going to start a yearly census, and there are going to be hundreds and hundreds of questions.
[00:37:59.922 --> 00:38:05.506]  Some businesses in 2000 got a several hundred business survey and were threatened with arrest.
[00:38:06.026 --> 00:38:09.168]  A federal judge in Houston blocked it and said, no, it's a Fifth Amendment.
[00:38:09.549 --> 00:38:15.233]  Folks, you can be caught with a dead woman in your truck with a bloody hatchet
[00:38:16.141 --> 00:38:18.802]  And you don't have to answer questions.
[00:38:19.302 --> 00:38:20.563]  The scum of the earth doesn't.
[00:38:20.583 --> 00:38:21.523]  It's called the Fifth Amendment.
[00:38:21.863 --> 00:38:25.905]  You know, what people like Kenneth Lay and Dick Cheney and others have been taking.
[00:38:27.086 --> 00:38:41.192]  But then they claim they sent some 20-year-old dick-faced kid, is what I had, threatening me three separate times at my door until I stuck a camera in his face, trying to make, with a little plastic badge, to fill out the form.
[00:38:41.232 --> 00:38:42.292]  And I threw it at him.
[00:38:42.912 --> 00:38:44.473]  I threw it on the ground and said, get out of here.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.480]  I'm going to call the police.
[00:38:46.501 --> 00:38:47.261]  You're trespassing.
[00:38:47.741 --> 00:38:49.882]  He finally scurried off, threatening to have me arrested.
[00:38:50.463 --> 00:38:52.684]  But no, you don't have to answer it, and I'm not going to answer it.
[00:38:52.724 --> 00:38:53.444]  And you know what we'll do?
[00:38:53.744 --> 00:38:56.105]  We'll call the legislative update number, Linda.
[00:38:56.906 --> 00:39:08.612]  Okay, and this report will tell you that they're going to ask questions about race, financial information, and intimate personal habits.
[00:39:09.247 --> 00:39:09.687]  I hear you.
[00:39:09.707 --> 00:39:10.388]  Thanks for the call.
[00:39:10.448 --> 00:39:11.188]  And a great point.
[00:39:11.488 --> 00:39:13.369]  We'll call that number in the next hour.
[00:39:13.409 --> 00:39:14.489]  Stephanie, don't let me forget.
[00:39:14.509 --> 00:39:16.210]  I always say I'll do something and half the time don't.
[00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:24.853]  Like I was going to have an FAA former air traffic controller on about 9-11 yesterday and do it.
[00:39:24.873 --> 00:39:26.274]  Just forgot I had that guest.
[00:39:27.394 --> 00:39:28.575]  I'm working too much, folks.
[00:39:28.955 --> 00:39:32.076]  We've got so many irons in the fire, so I'm sorry I'm whining about it.
[00:39:32.116 --> 00:39:36.878]  But we will call that number and play that in the...
[00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:41.351]  In fact, Stephanie, why don't you just call that number now and go ahead and just record.
[00:39:41.371 --> 00:39:42.731]  Nah, we'll just play it live on air.
[00:39:42.771 --> 00:39:43.972]  Why even have you record it?
[00:39:44.012 --> 00:39:44.912]  It's more to work for you.
[00:39:45.952 --> 00:39:50.973]  But I think the network airs that from time to time, but I've certainly heard it before.
[00:39:51.413 --> 00:39:52.394]  We've played it here before.
[00:39:53.274 --> 00:40:05.557]  But, yeah, the last census, the 51 questioner that 1 in 6 got, 1 in 6 homes got, domiciles as they call it, said, what gallon is your toilet?
[00:40:07.259 --> 00:40:08.380]  How many cars do you have?
[00:40:08.440 --> 00:40:09.180]  What model?
[00:40:10.881 --> 00:40:12.321]  How much money do you have in the bank?
[00:40:12.742 --> 00:40:14.642]  And this is under threat of perjury, you must answer.
[00:40:14.882 --> 00:40:15.503]  Total fraud.
[00:40:16.623 --> 00:40:17.483]  Do you have a renter?
[00:40:17.524 --> 00:40:18.424]  Do they pay cash?
[00:40:18.464 --> 00:40:19.904]  What was their last address?
[00:40:21.065 --> 00:40:22.646]  Do you own firearms?
[00:40:24.246 --> 00:40:30.689]  And again, they had this 51-question survey, and they had a bunch of different versions of it.
[00:40:30.709 --> 00:40:31.329]  I don't remember how many.
[00:40:31.349 --> 00:40:33.170]  I think we saw eight different versions of it.
[00:40:34.016 --> 00:40:49.081]  I spent a lot of time on this, and we had cases, I remember one in Tennessee, of a guy, the woman refused to let him in, kind of a pervert, and he busted in the door and announced that he had law enforcement power and was trying to tie her up.
[00:40:49.121 --> 00:40:51.362]  The police came and arrested him.
[00:40:51.402 --> 00:40:53.323]  I mean, there were a bunch of these cases.
[00:40:54.023 --> 00:40:58.844]  And this is what you're going to have with the new tips program at the state level, which, by the way, never got canceled, had its name changed.
[00:40:59.905 --> 00:41:03.426]  You know, the cable person, the phone man,
[00:41:04.392 --> 00:41:05.733]  There, I'm politically incorrect.
[00:41:05.873 --> 00:41:17.980]  The cable person, the firefighter, whoever's in your house for whatever reason, they're looking for what's illegal, and they don't know what's illegal or what the law is.
[00:41:19.341 --> 00:41:21.882]  They're recruiting your neighborhood watch, tattletale head.
[00:41:22.062 --> 00:41:26.565]  I'm not saying you're bad if you're in the neighborhood watch, but the point is some control freaks gravitate towards this.
[00:41:27.585 --> 00:41:31.488]  Homeland Security is going for neighborhood association presidents.
[00:41:31.848 --> 00:41:33.529]  Now, those are control freaks, folks.
[00:41:34.878 --> 00:41:36.359]  Generally, most of the time.
[00:41:36.679 --> 00:41:43.121]  And so it's going to be that type of a lunatic out with a plastic badge running your life.
[00:41:44.681 --> 00:41:47.042]  And I don't think it's the type of system we want to live under.
[00:41:48.162 --> 00:41:48.983]  Tim in Ohio.
[00:41:49.023 --> 00:41:49.643]  Tim, go ahead.
[00:41:49.983 --> 00:41:52.444]  Hey, we're going to bet those plastic badges are made in China.
[00:41:53.284 --> 00:41:54.644]  Yeah, I'm sure they are.
[00:41:54.724 --> 00:41:56.905]  I want to quickly touch on about four or five things here real quick.
[00:41:57.373 --> 00:42:01.676]  On the Independent Film Channel a couple years ago, they had a flick, Berkeley in the 60s.
[00:42:01.696 --> 00:42:06.539]  Did you catch that with the Black Panthers when they took all the weapons into the state capitol building in California?
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:21.509]  No, but I've read about that, and that was the type of stuff that scared white America into, oh, we better pass a bunch of gun control laws because we can't have these black people doing this.
[00:42:22.376 --> 00:42:31.218]  And, you know, that type of deep racism is always used to put in police state measures which actually target the entire society.
[00:42:31.938 --> 00:42:33.659]  But I was familiar with it.
[00:42:34.219 --> 00:42:42.961]  Now, moving on, Marbury v. Madison, that course case which says anything, any law against the Constitution is null and void.
[00:42:43.001 --> 00:42:45.142]  I saw that in your 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:42:45.562 --> 00:42:45.762]  Yes.
[00:42:47.423 --> 00:43:00.974]  When Bush and or Kerry were in Skull and Bones, they took an oath to outlive all other oaths they would ever take, which would, like, either we have a Constitution or we don't.
[00:43:01.394 --> 00:43:09.240]  And when he said, promote, protect, and defend, or preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, they've done nothing but destroy it.
[00:43:11.382 --> 00:43:14.984]  Is that where that oath comes into play, where you can actually see it in real terms?
[00:43:16.423 --> 00:43:17.023]  Well, yes.
[00:43:17.123 --> 00:43:26.449]  I mean, you have people in government swearing an oath to protect, to preserve, to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic.
[00:43:27.229 --> 00:43:33.192]  And then, I mean, I've got a box full of training manuals, flyers, videos the police have sent me.
[00:43:33.212 --> 00:43:34.173]  We put it in films.
[00:43:34.653 --> 00:43:36.094]  You know, it's on the website.
[00:43:36.154 --> 00:43:37.615]  It's been in the major newspapers.
[00:43:38.606 --> 00:43:41.407]  Where it says, those that make frequent references to the U.S.
[00:43:41.447 --> 00:43:42.808]  Constitution are terrorists.
[00:43:43.328 --> 00:43:45.128]  Those that have firearms are terrorists.
[00:43:45.509 --> 00:43:46.829]  Homeschoolers are terrorists.
[00:43:46.849 --> 00:43:50.350]  I mean, I have FEMA teaching this on video, not just the training manuals.
[00:43:50.911 --> 00:43:57.253]  I mean, how do the cops swear an oath to it, and then they're running around saying people that talk about it are evil?
[00:43:57.613 --> 00:43:58.553]  That was in Phoenix, right?
[00:43:58.573 --> 00:44:01.214]  Yeah, well, that's just one of the things.
[00:44:01.494 --> 00:44:06.256]  Since we got that and brought that out, I've literally got a box of stuff sent to me, and it's all similar.
[00:44:07.731 --> 00:44:07.911]  Right.
[00:44:08.111 --> 00:44:08.992]  What is it going to take?
[00:44:09.012 --> 00:44:09.172]  You know,
[00:44:37.717 --> 00:44:49.348]  Who has the authority, and more importantly, the gut, to go in there and arrest this defying administration and all of their controllers behind the scenes and see that they're all brought to justice for crimes committed and covered up?
[00:44:49.929 --> 00:44:53.733]  Well, you know, again, Bush is just a puppet, carries a puppet, and...
[00:44:54.811 --> 00:45:04.676]  What we need to do is take our states back one by one, get out the electronic voting machines, say to people, hey, the government's going to blow stuff up because they're going to be mad about us taking the country back.
[00:45:05.056 --> 00:45:07.737]  They're going to try to take our liberties under the guise of terrorism.
[00:45:08.197 --> 00:45:09.958]  They're going to do this when we try to remove them.
[00:45:10.518 --> 00:45:16.201]  And then, once we've got our country back, then go and have grand juries...
[00:45:16.921 --> 00:45:18.222]  Let's not forget Karl Rove.
[00:45:45.498 --> 00:45:46.118]  Sounds good to me.
[00:45:46.138 --> 00:45:51.301]  Either that or we can pray to God for some type of earthquake just in Bohemian Grove.
[00:45:52.402 --> 00:45:54.343]  Well, I wish no harm upon these people.
[00:45:55.043 --> 00:45:57.805]  You know, they're already... Right, they're going down.
[00:45:58.165 --> 00:45:59.526]  They're in a one-way elevator to hell.
[00:45:59.566 --> 00:46:00.566]  They put themselves in it.
[00:46:01.147 --> 00:46:10.432]  But really the key here is waking people up not to go... Look, as soon as people wake up to this system and see the illusion for what it is, they lose their power.
[00:46:10.712 --> 00:46:12.633]  Their power is through conning good people.
[00:46:13.306 --> 00:46:14.046]  I appreciate the call.
[00:46:14.226 --> 00:46:14.546]  Sure.
[00:46:14.926 --> 00:46:15.306]  You bet.
[00:46:15.546 --> 00:46:16.167]  Good to hear from you.
[00:46:16.907 --> 00:46:17.867]  David in Oklahoma.
[00:46:17.887 --> 00:46:18.647]  David, go ahead.
[00:46:19.367 --> 00:46:19.667]  Alex.
[00:46:20.047 --> 00:46:20.287]  Yes.
[00:46:20.427 --> 00:46:23.268]  I don't have anything to add about the gun issue.
[00:46:23.388 --> 00:46:25.248]  I agree with you 100% on that.
[00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:31.410]  What I'd like to talk about is the federal marriage amendment that's up for consideration right now.
[00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:41.952]  It seems to me that this whole issue with the gay marriage is coming up as a symptom, and what we should do is
[00:46:43.115 --> 00:46:56.310]  Rather than go after the anti-gay marriage amendment, whatever, what we should do is amend the Constitution to make our Supreme Court justices accountable to the American people through an election.
[00:46:58.693 --> 00:46:59.274]  Well, look...
[00:47:01.295 --> 00:47:10.284]  I don't have the amendment in front of me, but it's very dangerous to start bringing up constitutional amendments because then that's going to have to go into a constitutional convention.
[00:47:10.764 --> 00:47:17.791]  Some say they don't have to, but during that process, once it's opened up, they can rewrite the whole Constitution, the whole Bill of Rights.
[00:47:17.811 --> 00:47:19.112]  That's why these are so dangerous.
[00:47:19.793 --> 00:47:22.936]  And most of the amendments we've gotten since the first ten have been bad.
[00:47:23.036 --> 00:47:23.216]  Now...
[00:47:24.108 --> 00:47:31.574]  Elaborating on that, what this amendment really does is it says, well, a relationship between a man and a woman is special, which I agree.
[00:47:31.994 --> 00:47:33.015]  That's marriage.
[00:47:33.555 --> 00:47:45.204]  But then it says, in some of the amendments they're trying to add in the Senate and things, oh, but then this other group, they can have their own legalese situation.
[00:47:45.965 --> 00:47:49.928]  And it's all to undermine society, to undermine the family.
[00:47:50.768 --> 00:47:51.369]  And it's...
[00:47:52.319 --> 00:47:55.781]  And at the same level, it really doesn't do anything.
[00:47:56.621 --> 00:48:09.028]  While the so-called conservatives are gun-grabbing, open borders, signing on to UNESCO, doing all this New World Order stuff, they've got to give the people of conservatives a few so-called victories.
[00:48:09.308 --> 00:48:15.011]  And that's really, this is an election year stunt, which, of course, I said will never go anywhere.
[00:48:15.051 --> 00:48:20.614]  It's going to stall in the Senate, which it's now done, but then it gives them all a chance to talk about what they did.
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:24.440]  Anything else?
[00:48:25.621 --> 00:48:39.047]  Well, I mean, I don't really believe that it necessarily would have to lead to a constitutional convention, but the only part of the Constitution that I really would hold sacred would be the Bill of Rights and maybe the Amendment Against Slavery and so forth.
[00:48:39.567 --> 00:48:44.089]  But the rest of it was an experiment that's kind of worked and kind of not.
[00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:48.711]  Well, sir, sir, sir, the Bill of Rights and Constitution hasn't failed.
[00:48:49.031 --> 00:48:50.452]  We failed to enforce it.
[00:48:51.585 --> 00:48:56.448]  But it's the tyrannical interpreters of that Constitution that we can't get around now.
[00:48:56.488 --> 00:49:09.877]  We have no... I mean, in the age after post-Bill Clinton, what is considered good behavior, which is the only thing that a judge can be kicked out for under somebody's definition of what good behavior is.
[00:49:11.058 --> 00:49:14.060]  Well, look, the question is, what are you going to replace it with?
[00:49:14.740 --> 00:49:15.941]  An election system.
[00:49:16.061 --> 00:49:17.042]  We would have to elect
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:19.301]  The Supreme Court justices.
[00:49:19.341 --> 00:49:22.343]  They would have to be accountable to the people for their decisions.
[00:49:22.683 --> 00:49:29.988]  But again, sir, and I appreciate the call, the problem is more systemic than that.
[00:49:30.048 --> 00:49:31.149]  That is system-wide.
[00:49:32.510 --> 00:49:34.631]  We're losing our right to vote, period, sir.
[00:49:35.092 --> 00:49:42.096]  They're putting in fraudulent systems run by the government, paid for by the federal government, publicly fraud-ridden.
[00:49:43.357 --> 00:49:46.219]  At the same time, interfacing with that
[00:49:47.143 --> 00:49:49.725]  We have the grand juries turned into a rubber stamp.
[00:49:49.745 --> 00:49:51.546]  That was another form of voting by the citizenry.
[00:49:52.066 --> 00:49:54.008]  We have juries being rubber stamped.
[00:49:54.128 --> 00:49:55.569]  The judge is telling them how to rule.
[00:49:56.950 --> 00:49:59.031]  We have the people totally ignorant of their system.
[00:49:59.411 --> 00:50:02.033]  So really, folks, there's no magic fix to this.
[00:50:02.433 --> 00:50:08.377]  We've become decadent and corrupt and dumbed down and don't know where we came from, so we don't know who we are and where we're going.
[00:50:08.958 --> 00:50:12.220]  So we've got to relearn all of that first.
[00:50:13.047 --> 00:50:18.088]  Before we can even begin to have a debate about how to fix it.
[00:50:19.129 --> 00:50:28.311]  I mean, really, we have to... The average American has to know this war is illegal and corrupt, and why it's evil, to get us out of Iraq.
[00:50:28.391 --> 00:50:33.953]  We've got to know the Patriot Act is abhorrent, and demand that Congress remove it.
[00:50:35.033 --> 00:50:40.995]  But again, they don't care what we want now, because they know soon the whole country will not have the right to vote anymore.
[00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:47.015]  And we have to be strong enough to face just how bad things are.
[00:50:47.035 --> 00:50:50.178]  I mean, we're shipwrecked.
[00:50:50.238 --> 00:50:51.980]  The whole country's on the rocks, folks.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:56.025]  I'm trying to get us towed off the rocks first before we then decide some course.
[00:50:56.445 --> 00:50:57.206]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:57.326 --> 00:50:58.708]  I'll take your calls from Germany.

[00:52:00.959 --> 00:52:02.480]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:05.741]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:52:05.882 --> 00:52:09.784]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:52:09.824 --> 00:52:14.046]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:52:14.406 --> 00:52:18.168]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:52:18.328 --> 00:52:20.089]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:52:20.709 --> 00:52:23.630]  The riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:52:23.670 --> 00:52:28.372]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:52:28.532 --> 00:52:31.573]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:52:31.753 --> 00:52:34.614]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:52:35.094 --> 00:52:41.216]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:52:41.756 --> 00:52:45.560]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:53:00.134 --> 00:53:08.378]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:53:08.638 --> 00:53:13.000]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:22.204]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.

[00:53:26.326 --> 00:53:31.351]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:53:31.651 --> 00:53:38.377]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:53:38.877 --> 00:53:39.238]  What about you?

[00:53:48.613 --> 00:53:51.434]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:09.196 --> 00:54:13.457]  Alright, Keith and Gary and Mark and everybody else, you're coming up with a ton of news.
[00:54:14.377 --> 00:54:19.898]  But let's go to the Niederrhein in Germany and talk to Ross, calling us from Deutschland.
[00:54:19.918 --> 00:54:21.999]  Ross, good to have you on board with us.
[00:54:22.079 --> 00:54:22.699]  What's going on?
[00:54:22.719 --> 00:54:24.279]  Hi, Alex.
[00:54:24.499 --> 00:54:25.199]  My name is Ross.
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:26.960]  I got two things.
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:31.901]  I want to ask what that Highway Watch program is.
[00:54:32.441 --> 00:54:33.921]  I'm pretty concerned.
[00:54:33.941 --> 00:54:36.802]  I read about it that the government want to
[00:54:37.526 --> 00:54:49.076]  Bring 400,000 truckers into... I want to make them the eye and the ear of the Homeland Security until March 2005 on the site of trucker.com.
[00:54:50.477 --> 00:54:51.558]  There's news about that.
[00:54:52.479 --> 00:54:55.541]  And they're making your truckers buy your population?
[00:54:57.263 --> 00:54:57.643]  What's that?
[00:54:58.003 --> 00:55:00.025]  Well, it sounds like East Germany, doesn't it?
[00:55:01.286 --> 00:55:02.867]  It sounds like Nazi Germany.
[00:55:02.947 --> 00:55:04.909]  Sorry, we got totally paralyzed here.
[00:55:05.299 --> 00:55:10.863]  I'm really stunned by reading that, because, I mean, you can't do that.
[00:55:12.385 --> 00:55:14.346]  You seed fear under your people.
[00:55:14.546 --> 00:55:18.630]  You can't trust your neighbor, and you can't say an open word.
[00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:22.212]  You have no free speech if you make your population spy.
[00:55:23.273 --> 00:55:25.675]  We have that here, and that's sick.
[00:55:27.096 --> 00:55:27.677]  It is sick.
[00:55:27.737 --> 00:55:32.841]  You create a thick atmosphere by it, and you raise the fear in the population.
[00:55:33.587 --> 00:55:37.989]  Well... I mean, you've got all those dirty bomb info on Fox News.
[00:55:38.069 --> 00:55:39.190]  I've seen it, you know?
[00:55:39.690 --> 00:55:41.931]  What the don't breathe, don't eat, they say.
[00:55:42.412 --> 00:55:42.492]  And...
[00:55:44.802 --> 00:55:48.545]  I think they're working with fear to bring you in line.
[00:55:48.605 --> 00:55:49.506]  Well, that's it.
[00:55:50.506 --> 00:55:51.547]  Here's Fox News.
[00:55:52.047 --> 00:56:06.418]  Florida citizens to help catch terrorists, law enforcement officials in central Florida are planning to train cable repairmen, exterminators, and apartment managers to report signs of terrorism and, of course, crime inside their clients' homes.
[00:56:07.178 --> 00:56:08.559]  So, total violation.
[00:56:08.779 --> 00:56:10.861]  You know, the cops can't come in without a warrant.
[00:56:11.887 --> 00:56:15.688]  Violate the Fourth Amendment, but they're going to have... Now, this has already been going on.
[00:56:15.708 --> 00:56:17.508]  Now they're just bringing it out in the open.
[00:56:17.528 --> 00:56:18.328]  What do you think about that?
[00:56:18.348 --> 00:56:38.532]  I heard about kids, you know, paying kids money for giving info and hear about the Highway Watch program, and we have that here, and by reading this and hearing about it, we sit here with open mouths, big eyes, and can't say a word.
[00:56:38.672 --> 00:56:40.712]  We're thinking, how can...
[00:56:41.690 --> 00:56:43.852]  Why would someone be so dumb to let this happen?
[00:56:44.892 --> 00:56:46.253]  Because it's very dangerous.
[00:56:46.353 --> 00:56:48.395]  It can bring a country down.
[00:56:48.775 --> 00:56:51.817]  We have it here and no one can trust anyone then.
[00:56:52.478 --> 00:56:59.483]  And you get a lot of new fancy security laws and lose all your rights.
[00:57:00.604 --> 00:57:01.525]  Really, phew.
[00:57:02.165 --> 00:57:04.607]  I don't know where you go there, but it's not okay.
[00:57:05.678 --> 00:57:06.339]  No, it's not.
[00:57:06.419 --> 00:57:08.220]  Hey, I tell you what, we've got a break, but stay there.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:19.310]  I want to come back and talk to you a few more minutes on the other side, Ross, from Germany, then we'll go to everybody else that's holding, then we'll get into secret film shows, Iraq prisoners being raped, including children.
[00:57:20.391 --> 00:57:24.475]  But before we do that, just briefly before this hour ends...
[00:57:25.439 --> 00:57:38.503]  I would encourage you all to visit infowars.com or prisonplanet.com and to peruse the dozens of videos that we carry, my films, other films, the books, the books on tape.
[00:57:39.426 --> 00:57:43.609]  The best materials I've found exposing the New World Order Crime Syndicate.
[00:57:43.629 --> 00:57:45.150]  These are powerful videos and books.
[00:57:45.450 --> 00:57:46.530]  They're waking people up.
[00:57:46.971 --> 00:57:48.432]  Get 9-11 The Road to Tyranny.
[00:57:48.472 --> 00:57:49.612]  Get The Masters of Terror.
[00:57:49.912 --> 00:57:51.513]  Get Police State Tree Total Enslavement.
[00:57:51.533 --> 00:57:54.055]  Get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:57:54.355 --> 00:57:56.476]  The toll-free number to call and order is 1-888-253-3139.
[00:57:56.697 --> 00:57:56.937]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:58:09.751 --> 00:58:20.274]  Or you can write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, L-A-M-A-R, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:58:21.195 --> 00:58:25.056]  My films are $25.95 a piece, all over two hours.
[00:58:25.076 --> 00:58:27.297]  $20 if you order three or more of any of the ten films I've made.
[00:58:27.317 --> 00:58:29.817]  And I've got a bunch of other great videos we carry.
[00:58:30.898 --> 00:58:31.498]  So, again...
[00:58:32.576 --> 00:58:33.057]  Big Brother.
[00:58:33.137 --> 00:58:33.517]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.645 --> 00:59:00.725]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:01.405 --> 00:59:02.546]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:03.166 --> 00:59:04.006]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.746 --> 00:59:05.606]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.626 --> 00:59:09.987]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.487 --> 00:59:14.628]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:18.149 --> 00:59:19.969]  All right, my friends, all ready.
[00:59:21.289 --> 00:59:23.770]  Get to hour number two.
[00:59:25.279 --> 00:59:28.922]  Total free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[00:59:29.542 --> 00:59:46.516]  More information is coming out about the brutal, unspeakable, hard-to-believe level of systematic raping and torture and death at the 32 camps in Iraq and in other places around the world.
[00:59:47.016 --> 00:59:49.238]  Many of the secret camps now coming out.
[00:59:50.159 --> 00:59:54.322]  Also, a bunch of Big Brother developments will be going over in some Second Amendment news.
[00:59:55.649 --> 01:00:11.655]  We're talking to Ross in Niederrhein, Germany, and he was talking about how Homeland Security, the TIPS program, the tattletales in the houses, the highway watch, how this happened in Germany, in East Germany, and under Hitler as well, and how dangerous it is.
[01:00:12.755 --> 01:00:14.796]  And he had some other points he wanted to add.
[01:00:15.457 --> 01:00:20.698]  Ross, so are people in Germany looking at what's happening in the U.S.?
[01:00:21.559 --> 01:00:21.779]  I mean...
[01:00:22.572 --> 01:00:27.054]  I mean, is it just you that's concerned, or do you have friends and family that see what's happening?
[01:00:28.154 --> 01:00:37.297]  I would say it's about 50% of people who read news, watch the tax shows, the daily news, who are pretty concerned.
[01:00:39.338 --> 01:00:49.282]  We got the impression the government wants the rest of the world to live in fear of the USA, and at the same moment live the people in the USA in fear.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:50.820]  Well, that's it.
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:01:01.104]  You see, we're supposed to live in fear, the world's supposed to live in fear, that America plays the part of the bad cop, while Europe, that really owns the U.S., uses us as their shill.
[01:01:01.745 --> 01:01:05.966]  And then we're to be discarded later, and I'm glad that you see that.
[01:01:06.327 --> 01:01:12.049]  So folks in Europe realize that it's not really the American people, that it's the elite in this country?
[01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:14.890]  No, sorry.
[01:01:14.970 --> 01:01:18.151]  It makes absolutely no sense to hate Americans or such.
[01:01:18.331 --> 01:01:19.732]  That's pretty clear here.
[01:01:20.618 --> 01:01:24.620]  All the photos, people from 68, the students, they got that.
[01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:32.605]  Meanwhile, about your government and this elite and... Yeah, fear is a very powerful emotion.
[01:01:33.465 --> 01:01:38.808]  And you can rule a country with that, but the end will not be nice in any way.
[01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:45.692]  And if you call your people in to give tips about the neighbors and the parents and...
[01:01:46.348 --> 01:01:53.057]  Call the truckers to watch the street for people who take photographs or ask questions.
[01:01:53.497 --> 01:01:55.440]  Then you will go in a deep black hole.
[01:01:56.461 --> 01:02:02.109]  Well, see, Ross, some people will rationalize and go, we've got the threat of Al-Syayida.
[01:02:02.705 --> 01:02:23.259]  The problem is, is that in every one of these programs, they say, fight terror and crime, report drugs, report guns, report child abuse, report... Yes, sure, you can use it for everything, and you will control everything, and with modern times computers, you've got the power to evaluate all that data.
[01:02:23.759 --> 01:02:28.282]  Well, yeah, I mean... You don't have cards from IBM like Hitler had.
[01:02:29.188 --> 01:02:34.934]  When your neighbor saw your card on his table at the town hall, you know, he could tell you, oh, it's time for you to go.
[01:02:36.496 --> 01:02:39.859]  But in these days, it goes really fast.
[01:02:39.999 --> 01:02:45.745]  And if you're in the computer, no neighbor can tell you, hey, it's time for you to leave the country.
[01:02:46.225 --> 01:02:50.109]  And actually, you can't go nowhere because we're in a time of global players.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:59.425]  So what you're saying is in Nazi Germany people could get word to escape and evade and get false identities?
[01:03:00.146 --> 01:03:00.627]  Sometimes.
[01:03:00.667 --> 01:03:01.968]  Sometimes.
[01:03:02.008 --> 01:03:07.693]  Some people had a chance to at least feel getting close and maybe I'd better leave now.
[01:03:07.773 --> 01:03:08.794]  And a lot of people did.
[01:03:09.294 --> 01:03:16.080]  And it's funny, actually, these days Americans come over to Europe and stay here.
[01:03:18.082 --> 01:03:20.643]  As much as never before, it's pretty rare.
[01:03:20.683 --> 01:03:25.465]  I have a lot of business friends and people I know who are leaving the country, by the way.
[01:03:28.387 --> 01:03:36.250]  I mean, America, the free nation of the world, the leader and all that, and people are leaving the country, and I guess they know why.
[01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:40.392]  I got another point about propaganda, simply.
[01:03:40.532 --> 01:03:43.493]  Okay, real quick, I'll let you finish up when we get back, then we'll go to...
[01:03:44.355 --> 01:03:46.576]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:10.627 --> 01:04:14.850]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.910 --> 01:04:21.834]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.974 --> 01:04:24.036]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:24.336 --> 01:04:34.763]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.983 --> 01:04:38.706]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video,
[01:04:39.906 --> 01:04:54.870]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:04:55.270 --> 01:05:01.012]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[01:05:01.252 --> 01:05:06.353]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[01:05:06.733 --> 01:05:16.035]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[01:05:16.375 --> 01:05:21.317]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[01:05:21.637 --> 01:05:25.658]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[01:05:25.858 --> 01:05:30.639]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light and allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[01:05:30.979 --> 01:05:36.964]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[01:05:37.245 --> 01:05:43.470]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:44.491]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[01:05:44.571 --> 01:05:45.752]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.490 --> 01:05:54.831]  Is your daily commute a grind?
[01:05:54.991 --> 01:05:58.753]  If it wears on your patience, you'll be amazed at how it grinds on your car or truck, too.
[01:05:58.933 --> 01:06:02.635]  Your engine and transmission wear away mile after mile and day after day.
[01:06:02.955 --> 01:06:06.577]  Hundreds of NT oil additive customers have reported increased fuel mileage.
[01:06:06.797 --> 01:06:11.239]  Fleets that conduct used oil analysis report up to 30% reduction in wear metals.
[01:06:11.559 --> 01:06:15.361]  NT oil additive is a 100% synthetic product made to perform.
[01:06:15.601 --> 01:06:16.302]  It really works.
[01:06:16.562 --> 01:06:22.685]  NT oil additive has been proven in many thousands of engines, manual and automatic transmissions, and other driveline components.
[01:06:22.965 --> 01:06:24.065]  Even in two-cycle engines.
[01:06:24.365 --> 01:06:26.886]  NT Oil Additive was developed for industrial uses.
[01:06:27.046 --> 01:06:30.307]  It works in heat exchangers, air compressors, vacuum pumps, and air tools.
[01:06:30.507 --> 01:06:35.568]  Gear boxes and hydraulic systems can operate up to 18 degrees cooler with NT Oil Additive.
[01:06:35.748 --> 01:06:37.168]  Diesel engines thrive on it, too.
[01:06:37.388 --> 01:06:41.469]  To place your order, call King Oil Company at 800-647-4079.
[01:06:42.329 --> 01:06:43.669]  We accept MasterCard and Visa.
[01:06:43.689 --> 01:06:48.450]  The order department is open from 8 to 5 Eastern Time, Monday through Friday, and on Saturday until noon.
[01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:48.890]  That's 800-647-4079.
[01:06:58.419 --> 01:06:59.059]  Big Brother.
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:00.800]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:01.501 --> 01:07:02.662]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:03.262 --> 01:07:04.103]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.843 --> 01:07:05.724]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.744 --> 01:07:10.227]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.587 --> 01:07:14.710]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:20.775 --> 01:07:22.216]  You have a Fifth Amendment.
[01:07:22.996 --> 01:07:24.797]  You do not have to incriminate yourselves.
[01:07:24.837 --> 01:07:26.619]  You don't have to answer anybody's questions.
[01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:36.334]  But the Supreme Court a few weeks ago said, yeah, even if you're in your backyard or walking down the road, you've got to produce your ID and answer some questions.
[01:07:37.355 --> 01:07:41.777]  Something our troops don't have to do when they're captured by enemy forces, but we do as citizens and slaves.
[01:07:42.438 --> 01:07:43.799]  Well, I'm not going to answer your questions.
[01:07:43.819 --> 01:07:45.079]  I don't care what the Supreme Court says.
[01:07:45.099 --> 01:07:47.261]  They can say black people are slaves again.
[01:07:47.301 --> 01:07:48.161]  I'm not going to follow that.
[01:07:49.122 --> 01:07:55.145]  The point is that we have to judge this by our own common sense and the Bill of Rights and human history.
[01:07:56.781 --> 01:08:01.243]  But we got a call about Ron Paul's legislative update, which is a toll-free number you can call.
[01:08:01.263 --> 01:08:05.585]  We're going to call that in just a second here on air, saying that a new census is coming out.
[01:08:06.105 --> 01:08:07.946]  And I read about this four years ago.
[01:08:07.986 --> 01:08:12.708]  They were going to have a yearly census with hundreds of questions and fine you or arrest you.
[01:08:12.728 --> 01:08:13.489]  We didn't answer it.
[01:08:13.529 --> 01:08:14.629]  I mean, it's ridiculous, folks.
[01:08:14.649 --> 01:08:15.470]  You have a Fifth Amendment.
[01:08:16.550 --> 01:08:24.974]  The census is how many people live here for congressional districts to be formed, how many House members your state gets according to population.
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:30.702]  So we're going to play that in just a second, then we'll go to Keith and Mark and Lorraine and Bill and others.
[01:08:31.522 --> 01:08:34.643]  Ross from Germany, finishing up your propaganda comment quickly.
[01:08:34.663 --> 01:08:35.024]  Go ahead.
[01:08:35.864 --> 01:08:36.864]  I try to be fast.
[01:08:38.185 --> 01:08:48.329]  What I saw, I mean, you collect news every day, and I'm really into that, and many others are too, but very many people don't have the time to do that all day.
[01:08:48.769 --> 01:08:51.030]  And it's pretty complex.
[01:08:51.110 --> 01:08:54.511]  There's companies and those...
[01:08:56.465 --> 01:08:57.425]  Don't have the backstory.
[01:08:57.465 --> 01:08:57.865]  I go on.
[01:08:59.466 --> 01:09:15.692]  What I realized is when people start to listen, it's when I mentioned the Build-A-Burgle group, and when I say five years ago, and they need since 54, you were not allowed to talk about it, or you were officially a lego, you know?
[01:09:16.152 --> 01:09:21.113]  And now you can talk about it, and you see it in mainstream media, at least a little bit of it.
[01:09:21.794 --> 01:09:25.835]  And if I mention to people who need their
[01:09:26.775 --> 01:09:31.698]  Well, why do you think just now they're starting to cover it?
[01:09:31.718 --> 01:09:35.140]  I mean, I know the answer, because we've been exposing it.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:36.241]  They tried to stonewall it.
[01:09:56.597 --> 01:09:58.618]  It was damn hard work to get there.
[01:09:58.638 --> 01:10:09.681]  I think some people really did hard work to get there that we now can say, read in the New York Times, Bilderberg exists, and you can say, no, here are the names.
[01:10:09.941 --> 01:10:17.504]  These people go there and meet since 1954, every year again, and maybe several other times a year.
[01:10:18.024 --> 01:10:21.925]  And you can say that, and just name a few names, and people know those names.
[01:10:22.913 --> 01:10:25.515]  And they realized, oh, there's something going on.
[01:10:25.835 --> 01:10:30.718]  And then you've got an open door to their minds to give more information.
[01:10:31.559 --> 01:10:33.440]  I agree.
[01:10:33.540 --> 01:10:36.903]  How did you learn about the broadcast to listen on the Internet, Ross?
[01:10:37.723 --> 01:10:41.806]  Actually, I'm on IRC, Internet Relay Chat, and on FNet.
[01:10:42.446 --> 01:10:45.268]  And the IRC has a channel called New World Order.
[01:10:45.288 --> 01:10:47.189]  There are some big fans of you.
[01:10:47.289 --> 01:10:50.572]  And I tuned in one day and was surprised to...
[01:10:51.519 --> 01:10:51.959]  Oh, we certainly do.
[01:10:51.979 --> 01:10:54.161]  We live here and we see it happening.
[01:10:54.482 --> 01:10:55.503]  Hey, good to hear from you.
[01:10:55.523 --> 01:10:57.284]  I appreciate the call, Ross.
[01:10:57.324 --> 01:11:03.550]  I would also add that the tyranny is taking place in Europe, too, but they're being more systematic about it here.
[01:11:17.958 --> 01:11:23.583]  I mean, they won't put up with that in Europe, having the TV and cable repairman spying on you.
[01:11:24.003 --> 01:11:35.733]  Again, the police have to have a warrant to come in your house, but they're going to train all the truck drivers and all the exterminators and all the firefighters and everybody else that when they're in your house, spy on you.
[01:11:36.434 --> 01:11:37.575]  It's a federal program.
[01:11:37.615 --> 01:11:39.797]  It never got shelled, and now they're announcing it again.
[01:11:40.976 --> 01:11:42.296]  And I'll tell you why they're announcing it.
[01:11:42.376 --> 01:11:47.778]  They're letting everybody complain about the Patriot Act and wine and, oh, you're taking our rights and have this big debate.
[01:11:48.538 --> 01:11:51.399]  And then they're going to blow a bunch of stuff up and say, see, it was needed.
[01:11:51.639 --> 01:11:52.079]  Shut up.
[01:11:52.600 --> 01:11:53.560]  You've lost the argument.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.680]  Go along with what we say.
[01:11:55.901 --> 01:11:59.122]  Okay, on air live here, we're going to go ahead and call Ron Paul's office.
[01:11:59.162 --> 01:12:00.002]  Let's go ahead and do that.
[01:12:01.522 --> 01:12:02.483]  The number is 888-322-1414.
[01:12:07.483 --> 01:12:10.464]  And we're going to go ahead and dial that and get his legislative update for this week.
[01:12:10.484 --> 01:12:13.865]  This is Ron Paul with the weekly update for Monday, July 12th.
[01:12:14.866 --> 01:12:18.327]  You may not have heard of the American Community Survey, but you will.
[01:12:19.107 --> 01:12:29.451]  The National Census, which historically is taken every 10 years, has expanded to quench the federal bureaucracy's ever-growing thirst to govern every aspect of American life.
[01:12:30.152 --> 01:12:36.294]  The new survey, unlike the traditional census, is taken each and every year at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:12:37.259 --> 01:12:38.020]  And it's not brief.
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:52.311]  It contains 24 pages of intrusive questions concerning matters that simply are none of the government's business, including your job, your income, your physical and emotional health, your family status, your dwelling, and your intimate personal habits.
[01:12:53.832 --> 01:12:56.214]  The questions are both ludicrous and insulting.
[01:12:56.234 --> 01:13:05.642]  The survey asks, for instance, how many bathrooms you have in your house, how many miles you drive to work, how many days you were sick last year, and whether you have trouble getting upstairs.
[01:13:06.164 --> 01:13:11.588]  It goes on and on, mixing inane questions with highly detailed inquiries about your financial affairs.
[01:13:12.309 --> 01:13:17.393]  One can only imagine the countless malevolent ways our federal bureaucrats could use this information.
[01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:23.698]  At the very least, the survey will be used to dull out court, which is reason enough to oppose it.
[01:13:25.239 --> 01:13:30.383]  Keep in mind the survey is not voluntary, nor is the Census Bureau asking politely.
[01:13:31.249 --> 01:13:31.770]  We're good to go.
[01:14:05.327 --> 01:14:10.089]  One of the worst aspects of the census is its focusing on classifying people by race.
[01:14:10.809 --> 01:14:22.513]  When government tells us it wants information to help any given group, it assumes every individual who shares certain physical characteristics has the same interests or wants the same things from government.
[01:14:23.413 --> 01:14:26.555]  This is an inherently racist and offensive assumption.
[01:14:28.154 --> 01:14:28.554]  Thank you.
[01:14:49.093 --> 01:14:58.698]  Business enjoys having such an extensive information available from one source, but it's hardly the duty of the taxpayer to subsidize the cost of market research.
[01:15:00.059 --> 01:15:07.843]  At least the national census has its origins in the Constitution, which is more than one can say about the vast majority of programs funded by Congress.
[01:15:08.824 --> 01:15:18.589]  Still, Article I makes it clear that the census should be taken every 10 years for the sole purpose of congressional redistricting
[01:15:19.289 --> 01:15:22.392]  An enforcement of taxes prior to the disastrous 16th Amendment.
[01:15:23.132 --> 01:15:31.159]  This means a simple count of the number of people living in a given area so that numerically equal congressional districts can be maintained.
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:37.525]  The founders never authorized the federal government to continuously survey the American people.
[01:15:38.465 --> 01:15:45.051]  More importantly, they never envisioned a nation where the people would roll over and submit to every government demand.
[01:15:45.632 --> 01:15:55.080]  The American Community Survey is patently offensive to all Americans who still embody that fundamental American virtue, namely a healthy mistrust of government.
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:07.790]  The information demanded in this new survey is none of the government's business, and the American people should insist that Congress reject it now before it becomes entrenched.
[01:16:09.251 --> 01:16:11.253]  Thanks for calling this weekly update at 888-322-1414.
[01:16:14.048 --> 01:16:15.950]  A new update is available every Monday.
[01:16:15.970 --> 01:16:22.135]  The text of this and previous updates can be found at www.house.gov.
[01:16:23.756 --> 01:16:26.198]  Under the heading entitled, Texas Straight Talk.
[01:16:27.339 --> 01:16:28.000]  Thanks for calling.
[01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.081]  Well, thank you, Congressman.
[01:16:30.101 --> 01:16:31.502]  We're going to get him back up on the show.
[01:16:31.522 --> 01:16:33.804]  We've had him on, I don't know, 20-plus times over the years.
[01:16:33.824 --> 01:16:35.446]  It's time to have Ron Paul back on.
[01:16:36.927 --> 01:16:41.691]  And, yeah, so basically in 2000 I became aware of that American Surveys, and it's going to be every year.
[01:16:43.172 --> 01:16:44.394]  Hundreds of questions.
[01:16:45.095 --> 01:16:47.178]  You know, the one back in 2000 just hit 51.
[01:16:48.300 --> 01:16:53.407]  And there's a bunch of different surveys, and it's just unbelievable.
[01:16:53.427 --> 01:16:56.972]  I mean, I actually got one of these things back in 2000.
[01:16:57.052 --> 01:16:58.714]  I already went into that last hour.
[01:16:59.818 --> 01:17:01.639]  You know, he says you're legally bound.
[01:17:01.659 --> 01:17:02.700]  I want to get him on and talk about that.
[01:17:03.140 --> 01:17:08.843]  The federal judge in Houston told him to stop it nationwide in 2000, saying it's a violation of the Fifth Amendment.
[01:17:09.324 --> 01:17:15.867]  And I didn't answer him, and there's been one person back in the 60s charged for refusing a census, just to say how many live there.
[01:17:17.688 --> 01:17:21.010]  That was the 60 census, and they didn't get around to charging them until 63.
[01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:27.374]  So it's all color of law, and you don't have to fill it out, and just don't answer the door.
[01:17:29.239 --> 01:17:38.142]  But imagine, most people are going to go along with this, and so they're going to normalize it, and we're all going to be getting our monthly census, and got to answer our little questions.
[01:17:38.842 --> 01:17:40.843]  I mean, folks, that's not freedom, okay?
[01:17:41.003 --> 01:17:43.064]  It violates your Fifth Amendment.
[01:17:43.104 --> 01:17:44.804]  Let's go ahead and talk to Keith in Texas.
[01:17:44.844 --> 01:17:45.724]  Keith, thanks for holding.
[01:17:46.025 --> 01:17:46.505]  Go ahead.
[01:17:46.525 --> 01:17:47.765]  Hi.
[01:17:49.186 --> 01:17:50.946]  I have been at my shop.
[01:17:51.566 --> 01:17:54.967]  I've been selling your videotapes.
[01:17:55.067 --> 01:17:56.848]  Actually, the whole InfoWars line...
[01:17:57.832 --> 01:18:01.415]  And I've had a lot of success selling at my juice bar.
[01:18:01.735 --> 01:18:13.663]  And I just wanted to put it out there to other people who are business owners that they... I've had... You know, at first I was really hesitant to put my business on the line to make a political statement.
[01:18:13.683 --> 01:18:18.687]  You know, unfortunately, you didn't hit star 70, so your call waiting, somebody's calling you.
[01:18:18.707 --> 01:18:19.948]  Oh, really?
[01:18:20.308 --> 01:18:22.590]  That's what that clip... You know, that clipping does, yeah.
[01:18:23.210 --> 01:18:25.852]  Now, I take it you say you own a juice bar...
[01:18:26.644 --> 01:18:28.045]  And you're selling my videos.
[01:18:28.526 --> 01:18:28.786]  Yeah.
[01:18:29.026 --> 01:18:30.007]  And people like them.
[01:18:30.787 --> 01:18:36.772]  Yeah, and people are really... You know, and I have an opportunity to have a conversation, a one-on-one conversation with people all day long.
[01:18:37.273 --> 01:18:39.414]  And I'm, like yesterday... Well, stay there.
[01:18:39.575 --> 01:18:41.476]  We'll talk about it when we get back, Keith.
[01:18:41.876 --> 01:18:42.617]  Stay with us, folks.
[01:18:42.657 --> 01:18:43.278]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:18:54.369 --> 01:18:56.671]  The sun is getting brighter and the days are getting longer.
[01:18:56.871 --> 01:18:58.192]  Summer's just around the corner.
[01:18:58.432 --> 01:18:59.634]  What are your plans for it?
[01:18:59.954 --> 01:19:00.334]  Fishing?
[01:19:00.614 --> 01:19:01.055]  Gardening?
[01:19:01.115 --> 01:19:01.535]  Camping?
[01:19:01.735 --> 01:19:03.877]  I'm sure you'll spend more time enjoying the outdoors.
[01:19:04.097 --> 01:19:07.280]  And I'm sure the ticks and mosquitoes will spend more time enjoying you.
[01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:09.862]  It's not just itching and scratching we have to worry about.
[01:19:10.142 --> 01:19:13.505]  Now there's incurable illnesses like Lyme disease and the West Nile virus.
[01:19:13.866 --> 01:19:18.970]  Deet is proven to keep the bugs away, but it's also proven to cause brain damage in laboratory animals.
[01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:25.096]  That's not a choice I want to make, and I don't have to, thanks to Natural Answer, available at naturalanswer.com.

[01:20:02.634 --> 01:20:07.916]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[01:20:08.096 --> 01:20:10.697]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[01:20:10.817 --> 01:20:15.918]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own elections?

[01:20:53.715 --> 01:20:57.558]  Hi, this is Jack Brownrigg with a special offer to listeners of GCN Radio.
[01:20:57.838 --> 01:21:04.803]  Use the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights for your good, not the good of manipulating government agencies.

[01:21:06.764 --> 01:21:11.267]  GCN is contracted with Midas Resources for copies of The Citizen's Rulebook.
[01:21:11.408 --> 01:21:12.688]  This is more than a handbook.
[01:21:12.869 --> 01:21:16.171]  It is your guide to a freer life with less governmental interference.

[01:21:36.358 --> 01:21:36.559]  Thank you.

[01:22:05.634 --> 01:22:12.659]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:19.145]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:22:19.285 --> 01:22:20.506]  There are no side effects.
[01:22:20.706 --> 01:22:21.186]  We're good to go.

[01:23:07.088 --> 01:23:09.408]  Again, I snuck in there four years ago.
[01:23:09.428 --> 01:23:10.729]  I was talking to Keith during the break.
[01:23:11.169 --> 01:23:12.489]  He said, hey, have you seen the Wall Street Journal?
[01:23:12.529 --> 01:23:13.049]  I said, no.
[01:23:13.769 --> 01:23:18.830]  Big Wall Street Journal article he said about the Bohemian Grove and how it's no big deal and how wonderful it is.
[01:23:19.370 --> 01:23:22.371]  If that's the case, then why did major papers say it didn't exist?
[01:23:23.010 --> 01:23:30.241]  Just a few years ago, again, to show the dishonesty, why are they coming out with Bilderberg Group now saying, oh, they were the ones that picked John Edwards?
[01:23:30.562 --> 01:23:34.368]  Why are they, because we've been exposing them, now they're having to respond.
[01:23:35.253 --> 01:23:35.573]  I think so.
[01:24:02.659 --> 01:24:03.780]  People are responding to it.
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:07.701]  It's great because I have a one-on-one chance to talk to people.
[01:24:07.782 --> 01:24:12.764]  And all day yesterday, you talked about Bohemian Grove, and so I was talking about Bohemian Grove.
[01:24:12.944 --> 01:24:31.453]  People who would come into the shop, and I'd say, hey, did you know that Bush and his son and Kissinger and these other elites, heads of media, heads of state, go to this place in Northern California every year, and they do these mock human sacrifices and
[01:24:31.934 --> 01:24:59.493]  And they do this ceremony called the Cremation of Care, and they all dress in black, and it's really scary, and this guy, Alex Jones, he made this video, and I get to have a chance to talk to people on a one-on-one basis, and then I have the videos for sale right by the front counter, and people are, you know, people really, it's amazing to me because it shows me that people are a lot more open than you would think, and I just want to put it out there to other people.
[01:25:00.049 --> 01:25:05.230]  Do you have courage with their businesses to take a stand and make a statement?
[01:25:05.290 --> 01:25:15.513]  Well, there are a lot of businesses, video shops and grocery stores and restaurants that do sell videos, and if folks want them, we've got bulk pricing on them.
[01:25:15.553 --> 01:25:20.394]  They can call the toll-free number, and they'll give them the office number, and we can work that out for folks.
[01:25:20.874 --> 01:25:24.055]  Now, tell me about this Wall Street Journal article, because I'm going to go out and get it.
[01:25:24.898 --> 01:25:36.523]  Yeah, yesterday, I was, you know, like I said, I was thinking about the Bohemian Grove all day, and then I was at the grocery store, and I looked down at the Wall Street Journal, and it said, Bohemian, and then I just was like, oh, it's Bohemian Grove.
[01:25:36.903 --> 01:25:38.844]  Ha ha, like really, it's going to be in the paper.
[01:25:38.864 --> 01:25:44.826]  And then I read it, and it actually was about Bohemian Grove, and it was on the front page of yesterday's Wall Street Journal.
[01:25:45.386 --> 01:25:45.847]  Oh, man.
[01:25:46.147 --> 01:25:47.087]  What did they say about it?
[01:25:47.107 --> 01:25:48.928]  It's just a no big deal, get together, ha ha?
[01:25:48.988 --> 01:25:53.950]  Well, it was, you know, it didn't address that there was any kind of controversy about it,
[01:25:54.605 --> 01:26:21.770]  All it said was, it was just, it said that there was all these popular musicians now, like the new Groves people are starting, you know, have different tastes in music, and some of the old Groves men, they're not so hip to it, you know, the rockers, because it said that Bob Weir from the Grateful Dead, of all bands, is, you know, goes to the, is performing at the Grove, I guess this year, and Steve Miller, Steve Miller Band, and
[01:26:22.625 --> 01:26:24.466]  You know, that's what the article was about.
[01:26:24.566 --> 01:26:29.447]  And the flavor that it left in your mouth was that it was, you know, no big deal, that it was just a club.
[01:26:29.607 --> 01:26:30.307]  Did it say anything?
[01:26:30.347 --> 01:26:31.407]  How bad could it be?
[01:26:31.467 --> 01:26:34.708]  You know, hey, if Bob Weir goes to it, how bad could it be?
[01:26:34.768 --> 01:26:39.470]  That's what it's saying to all the Democrats, liberals who are Grateful Dead fans.
[01:26:40.050 --> 01:26:41.190]  Did it say anything else?
[01:26:41.290 --> 01:26:43.071]  Like, there's rumors of rituals.
[01:26:43.431 --> 01:26:43.891]  No, no, no.
[01:26:44.051 --> 01:26:44.791]  Nothing like that.
[01:26:45.151 --> 01:26:47.832]  No, it was a total, didn't even say that.
[01:26:48.931 --> 01:26:52.713]  All right, well, Keith, thanks for your interesting call, and keep up the good work, my friend.
[01:26:53.694 --> 01:26:54.334]  That's exciting.
[01:26:54.354 --> 01:26:55.134]  Good to hear from you.
[01:26:55.214 --> 01:26:55.495]  Wow.
[01:26:56.335 --> 01:26:57.316]  Anybody else see that?
[01:26:57.676 --> 01:27:04.119]  Let's talk to Mark in Minnesota, and then we'll go to Lorraine and Bill and Robert and others.
[01:27:04.159 --> 01:27:04.840]  Go ahead, Mark.
[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:05.640]  Hey, Alex.
[01:27:05.660 --> 01:27:06.340]  How are you doing?
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:07.181]  Good, buddy.
[01:27:07.461 --> 01:27:14.785]  Before I say what I wanted to say, I just wanted to encourage your listeners who have websites that have called in and, you know,
[01:27:16.192 --> 01:27:20.253]  I've been given the opportunity graciously by you to plug their websites.
[01:27:20.273 --> 01:27:27.814]  I want to encourage them to fire off an email to your webmaster and inquire about advertising because the rates are pretty good, and I plan on doing that.
[01:27:28.174 --> 01:27:28.714]  All right.
[01:27:28.814 --> 01:27:32.875]  Well, you're too kind, but it's just a... I mean, thanks, Mark.
[01:27:32.895 --> 01:27:33.835]  What else is on your mind?
[01:27:35.756 --> 01:27:40.856]  I noticed this article on MSNBC a few days ago, and I don't think you've talked about it.
[01:27:40.876 --> 01:27:43.377]  At least I might have missed it if...
[01:27:44.107 --> 01:27:46.348]  You did, but it was very intriguing.
[01:27:46.388 --> 01:27:54.051]  It's talking about this amnesty program that Saudi Arabia has going on for these Al-Qaeda officials.
[01:27:54.191 --> 01:28:02.135]  Yeah, and the paralyzed guy that turned himself in is the guy from the fake bin Laden tape with the fat bin Laden, which is admitted to be fake.
[01:28:02.335 --> 01:28:03.675]  This is all staged, folks.
[01:28:03.755 --> 01:28:05.776]  One of the leaders turned himself in.
[01:28:05.816 --> 01:28:06.857]  Nothing's going to happen to him.
[01:28:07.057 --> 01:28:09.818]  Yeah, Al-Qaeda turned himself into Al-Qaeda.
[01:28:09.838 --> 01:28:12.639]  So, yeah, I'm trying to make a statement myself.
[01:28:13.191 --> 01:28:23.677]  Kind of interesting how in that article they admit that the video was released by the CIA and that this guy was fighting against the Serbs in the Balkans in 1999.
[01:28:24.077 --> 01:28:27.740]  But I'm thinking, I noticed how supposedly one of them came from Syria.
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:30.581]  This guy, Al Harvey, came from Iran.
[01:28:30.721 --> 01:28:35.364]  I'm thinking it could be used as some sort of geopolitical agenda against Iran.
[01:28:35.524 --> 01:28:36.925]  Oh, they have a bunch of these guys.
[01:28:36.945 --> 01:28:38.426]  We have to go in to Iran.
[01:28:38.446 --> 01:28:38.806]  Stay there.
[01:28:38.966 --> 01:28:39.206]  Stay there.
[01:28:39.226 --> 01:28:39.807]  We'll talk about it.
[01:28:40.027 --> 01:28:41.007]  I should have gotten into this.
[01:28:41.067 --> 01:28:41.408]  It's true.
[01:28:41.488 --> 01:28:41.788]  It's true.
[01:28:44.312 --> 01:28:45.213]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.713 --> 01:28:47.314]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:48.235 --> 01:28:50.897]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:55.861]  Somebody wants to sue you.
[01:28:56.001 --> 01:28:58.723]  With a few keystrokes, anyone can find out your net worth.
[01:28:59.003 --> 01:29:04.206]  Everything that you've worked hard for can be taken away from you as fast as you can say, frivolous lawsuit.
[01:29:04.326 --> 01:29:09.409]  Whether it's the IRS, a vindictive ex-spouse, or an average Joe off the street, don't let them have it.
[01:29:09.589 --> 01:29:14.031]  The Asset Protection Team can show you how to protect yourself from anybody that wants to sue you.

[01:29:54.631 --> 01:29:57.633]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[01:29:57.973 --> 01:30:06.797]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:30:07.118 --> 01:30:11.800]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:18.982]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:30:19.382 --> 01:30:31.085]  It also removes foul-tasting odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[01:30:53.917 --> 01:30:56.218]  My family's breathing easier and now you can too.
[01:30:56.399 --> 01:30:59.761]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here to tell you about the Biozone Air Purifier.
[01:30:59.861 --> 01:31:02.062]  The Biozone Air Purifier is not a filter system.
[01:31:02.242 --> 01:31:08.206]  It works at the molecular level, finding the small bits of dust, allergens, and other particles in your air into clumps that are too heavy to float.
[01:31:08.406 --> 01:31:10.987]  They fall harmlessly to the floor to be literally swept away.
[01:31:11.247 --> 01:31:11.908]  Nothing escapes.
[01:31:12.028 --> 01:31:16.250]  The Biozone Air Purifier also kills virus and bacteria germs and totally removes odors.
[01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:20.053]  Out on the farm we have several cats and two big dogs, so pet odors can be a concern.
[01:31:20.173 --> 01:31:22.394]  But like the odors from anything else, simply gone.
[01:31:22.654 --> 01:31:22.954]  Smoke?
[01:31:23.194 --> 01:31:25.056]  My wife and I don't, but several of our friends do.
[01:31:25.236 --> 01:31:28.298]  Our Biozone Air Purifier clears out that smoke literally within minutes.
[01:31:28.518 --> 01:31:32.621]  I use it myself, and I'm telling you, your Biozone Air Purifier will improve the air in your home.
[01:31:32.781 --> 01:31:35.443]  It even comes with a 90-day money-back guarantee and free shipping.

[01:31:55.016 --> 01:31:57.737]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:31:57.757 --> 01:32:01.680]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:05.002 --> 01:32:05.943]  Oh, you gotta love it.
[01:32:07.003 --> 01:32:09.025]  The opportunity to fight the New World Order.
[01:32:09.165 --> 01:32:10.886]  I'm honored to be your host.
[01:32:10.966 --> 01:32:12.707]  I'm glad you're with us, my friends.
[01:32:15.767 --> 01:32:16.848]  Finishing up with Mark.
[01:32:17.328 --> 01:32:19.570]  Mark, let me just make a comment here, and then I'll let you finish up.
[01:32:19.590 --> 01:32:20.770]  I'm glad you brought this up.
[01:32:20.790 --> 01:32:29.536]  I mean, I printed the articles off this weekend, or on Monday, and I mentioned it once, and it just gives me a headache to even go over it.
[01:32:30.276 --> 01:32:41.002]  But yeah, you know, they got this paralyzed guy who helped lead bin Laden's forces against the Serbs out of Albania, when Bill Clinton shipped hundreds of millions of dollars to them.
[01:32:41.783 --> 01:32:44.885]  And that's all public, and the Republicans all voted for it, of course.
[01:32:46.759 --> 01:32:50.783]  Again, we've got al-Qaeda working for us in 99, or I should say for the globalists, not for us.
[01:32:50.823 --> 01:32:52.925]  We always see it as our country doing this, when it's really not.
[01:32:53.946 --> 01:33:03.116]  And then you've got him suddenly, you know, Saudi Arabia, we have an amnesty program, you won't get in trouble, everything's fine, just turn yourself in, and here comes the little agents getting off the plane, and it's...
[01:33:04.068 --> 01:33:07.130]  The paralyzed guy is the same guy from the video two years ago.
[01:33:07.170 --> 01:33:09.472]  The fat bin Laden in the cave.
[01:33:09.532 --> 01:33:10.232]  I'm going to get you.
[01:33:10.312 --> 01:33:11.093]  I'm going to kill you.
[01:33:11.193 --> 01:33:11.713]  I did it.
[01:33:11.733 --> 01:33:12.814]  9-11 is so great.
[01:33:13.314 --> 01:33:16.316]  And it's a fat guy with a nose twice the size of a huge belly.
[01:33:17.117 --> 01:33:18.178]  It is not the same person.
[01:33:18.218 --> 01:33:20.439]  They did voice print analysis.
[01:33:20.899 --> 01:33:23.441]  Major firms in the U.S., Canada, France, England.
[01:33:23.721 --> 01:33:24.402]  Totally fake.
[01:33:24.802 --> 01:33:33.530]  Because, again, you run Bin Laden's real voice through, you make a voice print key off that, and you try to run the other voice through, and it isn't even the same person, same dialect, folks.
[01:33:33.990 --> 01:33:47.703]  A fat guy in a dark room, you know, the lights turn way down with this fat guy sitting there, and then here is this paralyzed guy who's admitted CIA attack on the Serbs a few years before, and then now he turns himself in and they go, oh, this video's from the CIA.
[01:33:48.795 --> 01:33:52.497]  The CIA has this video of him getting off, and he's all happy, and, oh, I'm so happy!
[01:33:54.377 --> 01:34:14.285]  And we've got fake terror alert, fake terrorist section in the 9-11 section of prisonplanet.com, and we've got all the articles where they'll stage the arrest of an al-Qaeda leader, and it's a big celebration, it's incredible, and a month later they go, he was actually CIA, they staged the arrest to keep his cover clear, you know.
[01:34:15.214 --> 01:34:21.977]  And then a year later, the same guy's name, when they admit CIA, he's attacking us, he's really bad, we killed him.
[01:34:22.277 --> 01:34:23.938]  Then again, he's attacking, we killed him again.
[01:34:25.218 --> 01:34:26.819]  They know, people.
[01:34:27.979 --> 01:34:29.400]  It's out in plain view.
[01:34:30.060 --> 01:34:31.000]  Mark, go ahead.
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:40.204]  I can't figure out if they're propaganda, if they're so shoddy, or if they're trying to taunt us or what, but they even show some captured filmages in that video, and it's that transparently...
[01:34:44.259 --> 01:34:53.887]  Well, look, it's admitted that that video's fake.
[01:34:54.768 --> 01:35:00.333]  It's admitted, but they're still playing it on TV, because they know two years later people don't remember that.
[01:35:01.374 --> 01:35:03.335]  And, uh... I don't know, I'm sorry.
[01:35:03.395 --> 01:35:05.417]  I mean, it is funny, but it's not.
[01:35:05.457 --> 01:35:06.538]  It's like a tragic comedy.
[01:35:06.958 --> 01:35:07.499]  But, uh...
[01:35:08.217 --> 01:35:16.461]  I was thinking it could fit in with some sort of anti-Iranian geopolitical agenda or anti-Syria because they're saying, oh, he's in Iran, now we've got to go in there and get these other guys.
[01:35:16.902 --> 01:35:30.409]  Or I was thinking this could be the little supposed impetus to go have some staged capture of some so-called Bin Lane figure because they could say, oh, this guy, you just told us where so-called Bin Lane is.
[01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:33.170]  What do you mean by Bin Lane?
[01:35:35.749 --> 01:35:41.674]  Thanks for the call.
[01:35:41.814 --> 01:35:42.755]  I appreciate it, Mark.
[01:35:43.516 --> 01:35:45.377]  Let's talk to Lorraine in California.
[01:35:45.397 --> 01:35:46.218]  Lorraine, go ahead.
[01:35:46.238 --> 01:35:47.999]  I have a question for you.
[01:35:48.079 --> 01:35:52.363]  Is Martha Stewart from the House of Unicorns like Princess Diana Stewart?
[01:35:53.564 --> 01:35:54.384]  Are they connected?
[01:35:54.425 --> 01:35:59.669]  I know Martha's from Poland, but I thought maybe they were connected up somehow since she's so rich and everything.
[01:36:01.451 --> 01:36:02.553]  Did you know anything about that?
[01:36:03.094 --> 01:36:04.576]  I wasn't aware of that, no.
[01:36:04.816 --> 01:36:12.669]  And Martha Stewart really isn't rich compared to the elite who has hundreds of trillions of dollars at their...
[01:36:14.631 --> 01:36:27.674]  They burned Martha Stewart because she was well-known, and so she had the illusion of being an elitist, so they wouldn't have to go after Kenneth Lay and everybody else that would actually embarrass the system.
[01:36:28.054 --> 01:36:31.715]  But that hasn't worked for them, and Ken Lay has now been indicted and arrested last week.
[01:36:32.175 --> 01:36:35.376]  Yeah, why do you suppose that has happened?
[01:36:36.636 --> 01:36:38.697]  I mean, I'm just surprised they did arrest him.
[01:36:38.777 --> 01:36:40.497]  I thought that they had a lot of,
[01:36:41.209 --> 01:36:43.810]  You know, power, and that they wouldn't get to them.
[01:36:43.950 --> 01:36:49.873]  Well, they had to because a bunch of companies have recorded them bragging about scamming people.
[01:36:50.154 --> 01:36:50.514]  Uh-huh.
[01:36:50.894 --> 01:36:53.575]  And so independent groups released it.
[01:36:53.675 --> 01:36:54.656]  It got picked up.
[01:36:55.276 --> 01:36:58.438]  It didn't get a lot of attention, but it got some, and so they had to.
[01:36:59.578 --> 01:37:08.483]  So it's the old case of he got away with everything, and then he was dancing around with a dead body, basically, is the parallel, and it was too much.
[01:37:09.033 --> 01:37:10.454]  Now, what about Forbes?
[01:37:10.494 --> 01:37:12.556]  Now they'll probably have a kangaroo trial, though.
[01:37:14.537 --> 01:37:21.082]  He might get a month in some Hollywood prison, and then he'll be back out probably in the next Bush administration.
[01:37:21.162 --> 01:37:21.662]  Exactly.
[01:37:21.722 --> 01:37:23.624]  But what about John Kerry?
[01:37:23.644 --> 01:37:26.066]  He's from the Forbes, I understand.
[01:37:26.106 --> 01:37:29.768]  His mill name is Forbes, and he's from the Forbes group.
[01:37:30.289 --> 01:37:33.571]  What happened with that?
[01:37:33.631 --> 01:37:36.533]  Did he get a lot of money from Forbes or whatever?
[01:37:36.553 --> 01:37:38.375]  Do you know anything about that?
[01:37:39.113 --> 01:37:40.734]  They seem to be quiet about it.
[01:37:41.434 --> 01:37:48.537]  Well, it's John Forbes Carey and then his wife is Hines, who you salute every time you eat some ketchup.
[01:37:50.438 --> 01:37:53.800]  I'm sorry, it is better than Hunt's Ketchup, folks.
[01:37:54.700 --> 01:37:55.480]  And then Bush.
[01:37:55.581 --> 01:37:57.721]  See, Bush isn't just related to him on one side.
[01:37:57.782 --> 01:37:58.682]  He's related to him...
[01:37:59.521 --> 01:38:10.651]  On both sides, and then several generations back to the women who lost their names, I mean, look, skull and bones is all related.
[01:38:10.771 --> 01:38:13.773]  Bush is related closely to Cheney.
[01:38:14.214 --> 01:38:15.955]  They're related to James Baker.
[01:38:16.035 --> 01:38:17.576]  They're related to Clark Clifford.
[01:38:17.897 --> 01:38:19.478]  They're related to Bill Clinton.
[01:38:19.978 --> 01:38:21.560]  They're related to the Queen of England.
[01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:23.762]  It's a hereditary nest.
[01:38:23.822 --> 01:38:26.424]  I mean, look, not just that that's the admitted fact,
[01:38:27.159 --> 01:38:29.219]  But that also, it's common sense.
[01:38:29.239 --> 01:38:44.003]  We've got one fraternity from one university on the East Coast that's now produced, what, one, two, three, four, four presidents, now two presidential candidates, most are CIA directors, and they're all interbred.
[01:38:44.043 --> 01:38:49.084]  I mean, how is it that a fraternity with 15 members a year has both presidential candidates?
[01:38:49.764 --> 01:38:54.065]  Yeah, but I still don't understand if he'd gotten a Forbes wealth.
[01:38:54.205 --> 01:38:55.025]  He probably did.
[01:38:55.638 --> 01:39:01.183]  And slower to supposedly go way back to the China opium trade and the British and all that, the pirating.
[01:39:01.343 --> 01:39:05.867]  But I was just curious, because she's so rich, I was wondering if he was rich, too.
[01:39:06.327 --> 01:39:07.288]  Of course he's rich.
[01:39:07.348 --> 01:39:09.269]  Yeah, he probably got a lot, too.
[01:39:09.570 --> 01:39:12.272]  And there's nothing wrong with being rich if it wasn't ill-gotten.
[01:39:13.593 --> 01:39:17.435]  I mean, look, these families just pile their wealth up upon pile upon pile.
[01:39:17.816 --> 01:39:19.497]  Most of it's in tax-free foundations.
[01:39:19.517 --> 01:39:20.718]  They don't even really pay taxes.
[01:39:21.318 --> 01:39:25.742]  I mean, I'll never forget Parade Magazine a few years ago going, George Bush is worth $2 million.
[01:39:26.022 --> 01:39:28.604]  Oh, sure he is.
[01:39:28.664 --> 01:39:33.548]  I mean, the family owns oil wells, banks, triple-hole super tankers.
[01:39:35.089 --> 01:39:37.010]  They sit on the boards of hundreds of companies.
[01:39:37.050 --> 01:39:40.913]  They get $2 million speaking engagements, but they're worth $2 million.
[01:39:42.233 --> 01:39:48.497]  Like the Heinz Corporation, they sent their corporations outside the United States to get cheap labor.
[01:39:48.877 --> 01:39:50.898]  See, I don't have a problem with people being rich.
[01:39:50.918 --> 01:39:52.639]  I have a problem with the way they get it.
[01:39:52.659 --> 01:39:55.921]  Well, yeah, I don't have a problem with you if you make $10 million.
[01:39:55.961 --> 01:39:57.902]  But if you rob a bank to get it, I've got a problem.
[01:39:57.922 --> 01:39:58.503]  Exactly.
[01:39:58.623 --> 01:39:59.363]  I'm the same way.
[01:39:59.803 --> 01:40:00.804]  Lorraine, good to hear from you.
[01:40:01.428 --> 01:40:01.808]  You bet.
[01:40:01.868 --> 01:40:16.254]  But the liberals basically say all the wealth is bad, and that's the fake left, and the fake right says no, all wealth is good, no regulation, no control, but then the corporations actually write more regulations for us, call it conservative, and then have no regulations on themselves.
[01:40:17.134 --> 01:40:18.515]  So, again, it's not free market.
[01:40:18.555 --> 01:40:20.595]  It's called organized crime.
[01:40:21.916 --> 01:40:24.317]  Let's go ahead and talk to...
[01:40:26.832 --> 01:40:27.292]  Bill.
[01:40:27.432 --> 01:40:28.672]  Bill, where are you calling us from?
[01:40:29.232 --> 01:40:30.173]  Bill from Indiana.
[01:40:30.593 --> 01:40:31.053]  How are you?
[01:40:31.413 --> 01:40:31.633]  Good.
[01:40:31.953 --> 01:40:32.173]  Good.
[01:40:32.253 --> 01:40:32.693]  That's great.
[01:40:32.813 --> 01:40:35.174]  Hey, I've got a couple of things I wanted to mention to you.
[01:40:35.374 --> 01:40:38.454]  Maybe you already know this, but I just got this from Chosodosky.
[01:40:39.354 --> 01:40:45.976]  And it really disturbs me because I didn't know this.
[01:40:46.236 --> 01:40:49.256]  You're talking about Professor Chosodosky in global research.
[01:40:49.396 --> 01:40:49.576]  Right.
[01:40:50.376 --> 01:40:53.517]  And it says here, the Carlisle Group.
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:41:12.355]  It's a business arrangement between the Bush-Bin Laden families, wealthy Saudis, former Prime Minister John Major, James Baker III, Afsaneh Mashayaki, Frank Carlucci, and Colin Powell, including Madeleine Albright's daughter.
[01:41:12.755 --> 01:41:13.176]  Of course.
[01:41:13.796 --> 01:41:15.938]  But you talk about a conflict of interest.
[01:41:16.779 --> 01:41:16.919]  Now...
[01:41:17.717 --> 01:41:19.138]  Well, no, let's go over that.
[01:41:19.198 --> 01:41:22.020]  They're buying movie theater chains, TV network chains.
[01:41:22.220 --> 01:41:22.820]  Right.
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:25.061]  They run some of the biggest radio networks out there.
[01:41:25.081 --> 01:41:27.403]  This is how it works.
[01:41:29.624 --> 01:41:32.386]  They set up the Carlyle Group back in the early 80s.
[01:41:32.946 --> 01:41:36.168]  They created government policy in the late 80s to, quote,
[01:41:36.989 --> 01:41:37.549]  We're good to go.
[01:41:49.628 --> 01:41:52.649]  They're just brokers down to the biggest defense contractor.
[01:41:52.669 --> 01:41:54.469]  They're really bigger than Lockheed Martin now.
[01:41:54.749 --> 01:41:57.030]  Well, they own Lockheed Martin 70% now.
[01:41:57.110 --> 01:41:59.410]  I was about to say, so yeah.
[01:42:00.470 --> 01:42:16.794]  But then the biometric companies, the RFID companies, the implantable microchip companies, the face scanning camera companies, the SWAT team gear companies, the private prison companies, they own it all, brother, and they're going to force us all into it and the whole economy through their hands.
[01:42:16.814 --> 01:42:17.174]  Go ahead.
[01:42:17.394 --> 01:42:17.874]  Well, okay.
[01:42:18.234 --> 01:42:23.836]  So, they own 70% of Lockheed Martin, and Lockheed Martin now owns Sandia Laboratories.
[01:42:24.616 --> 01:42:27.317]  Sandia Laboratories makes bomb triggers, okay?
[01:42:27.577 --> 01:42:28.757]  I'm familiar with them, okay?
[01:42:30.198 --> 01:42:34.539]  That really upsets me, because... I mean, where's this going?
[01:42:34.559 --> 01:42:35.599]  It's a good old boys club.
[01:42:36.319 --> 01:42:37.220]  I mean, it's sickening.
[01:42:37.420 --> 01:42:41.361]  Well, it's not just some cheerful corruption or nepotism.
[01:42:41.501 --> 01:42:41.941]  It is...
[01:42:43.072 --> 01:42:44.836]  These are the people that carried out 9-11.
[01:42:45.437 --> 01:42:46.400]  They run Bin Laden.
[01:42:46.420 --> 01:42:47.542]  Their family makes the money.
[01:42:47.582 --> 01:42:51.111]  They make the money as defense contractors and chief owners in it.
[01:42:51.887 --> 01:43:01.789]  And look, the CIA got with the Saudis and said, look, give us your money, we'll buy up key industries, then we'll use a terrorist threat to have a huge war and we'll make all the money.
[01:43:02.089 --> 01:43:06.611]  It's totally staged, and that's just one motive, is the hundreds of billions in weapons sales.
[01:43:06.631 --> 01:43:11.372]  Then there's the trillions in oil, the billions in police state stuff here domestically.
[01:43:11.712 --> 01:43:12.772]  The Bush is owned.
[01:43:13.622 --> 01:43:21.648]  Of several major prison companies, over 50% of the stock, some of the biggest, most giant, sprawling private prisons are owned by these people.
[01:43:22.328 --> 01:43:29.233]  Then they ship the narcotics in, your dumb kid uses it, they put them in a private prison for using drugs that they sold them.
[01:43:30.053 --> 01:43:30.254]  Right.
[01:43:31.394 --> 01:43:34.236]  And one other thing, too, I want to bring to your attention.
[01:43:35.197 --> 01:43:40.801]  I got this from Michelle Trostovsky.
[01:43:42.362 --> 01:43:42.462]  And
[01:43:43.038 --> 01:43:45.940]  This whistleblower here is Richard Berta.
[01:43:46.100 --> 01:43:53.304]  He says the Pentagon exists for the oil companies and the nuclear weapons labs exist for the Pentagon.
[01:43:54.464 --> 01:44:03.549]  And one other thing has to do with the Japanese government placing troops on the ground in a war zone in Iraq for reconstruction.
[01:44:04.230 --> 01:44:08.012]  It says here the people over there were really upset and it will lead to rescinding Article 9
[01:44:09.196 --> 01:44:13.620]  The Japanese Constitution, which forever prohibits offensive military action.
[01:44:13.700 --> 01:44:13.940]  Right.
[01:44:14.261 --> 01:44:15.702]  So what's going on here?
[01:44:16.363 --> 01:44:30.395]  And also I found out, too, that this system where we're going to use troops on the ground instead of the police, that's gone.
[01:44:30.535 --> 01:44:31.396]  I mean, they're going to do it.
[01:44:31.983 --> 01:44:34.644]  Yeah, they've covertly gotten rid of Posse Comitatus.
[01:44:34.684 --> 01:44:35.845]  Thanks for the call.
[01:44:36.325 --> 01:44:37.145]  Bill, great points.
[01:44:38.826 --> 01:44:43.868]  And these naive people sit out there and go, these powerful individuals don't want more power.
[01:44:43.908 --> 01:44:46.148]  They're not taking our rights, or if they are, it's good.
[01:44:46.529 --> 01:44:47.489]  Let's just trust them.
[01:44:48.229 --> 01:44:57.413]  And then you look at these people, connected to every amount of drug dealing, money laundering, global prostitution, just every type.
[01:44:57.453 --> 01:44:58.493]  But they wear suits.
[01:44:59.033 --> 01:45:00.374]  They have short haircuts.
[01:45:01.895 --> 01:45:09.117]  Anyone knows that if someone wears a $2,000 suit and a $200 tie and flies around in helicopters, that we should trust them?
[01:45:10.237 --> 01:45:15.799]  Again, they talk with such nice East Coast, perfect English.
[01:45:16.499 --> 01:45:17.599]  We can trust them.
[01:45:17.659 --> 01:45:19.120]  These are good Christians.
[01:45:20.100 --> 01:45:21.100]  I mean, you know.
[01:45:21.300 --> 01:45:22.121]  Come on.
[01:45:22.781 --> 01:45:24.381]  They punished Martha Stewart.
[01:45:24.421 --> 01:45:25.282]  They must be good.
[01:45:26.422 --> 01:45:26.782]  Yeah.
[01:45:27.842 --> 01:45:28.722]  They want it all.
[01:45:29.363 --> 01:45:30.343]  They want it now.
[01:45:31.312 --> 01:45:33.554]  Robert in Tennessee, go ahead.
[01:45:34.115 --> 01:45:44.223]  Yeah, I was just calling to see what your insight was on... It seems like there's been a big push in biometrics as of lately, and I was wondering... Uh-huh, because the Carlisle Group owns it, yeah.
[01:45:44.423 --> 01:45:49.708]  Yeah, I was wondering if you think that they're going to try and push it on us after this next attack we're supposed to have.
[01:45:49.868 --> 01:45:50.929]  Going to push it on us?
[01:45:51.129 --> 01:45:56.514]  I mean, thousands of school districts, no cash allowed, must thumb scan to get food, training you for the system, getting you into the system.
[01:45:57.474 --> 01:46:00.336]  40-plus states having to get driver's license.
[01:46:00.817 --> 01:46:03.038]  Walmart's putting it in all over the country.
[01:46:03.899 --> 01:46:07.981]  The self-checkout lanes, Home Depots, HEBs, Kroger's, Safeways.
[01:46:09.242 --> 01:46:10.383]  Just wall-to-wall.
[01:46:11.364 --> 01:46:14.906]  160 in the Mexican Justice Ministry getting the chip to get in the building.
[01:46:15.186 --> 01:46:16.647]  Talking about making our police take it.
[01:46:17.047 --> 01:46:19.309]  I mean, absolutely, yeah, they're already pushing it.
[01:46:19.389 --> 01:46:19.849]  Exactly.
[01:46:20.029 --> 01:46:22.431]  When they blow our city up, then they're going to make us all take it.
[01:46:22.691 --> 01:46:29.292]  Yeah, it seems like they're just doing the mental preparations right now with all the Coca-Cola promotions.
[01:46:30.492 --> 01:46:34.133]  Hey, ABC News two nights ago, I read the article, didn't see the report, heard about it.
[01:46:34.413 --> 01:46:35.993]  Somebody's got to mail it to me if you got it.
[01:46:36.653 --> 01:46:38.794]  Just a ten-minute piece about, look, they're getting the chips.
[01:46:38.874 --> 01:46:41.434]  Look, the door is automatically open for them because they have the chips.
[01:46:41.654 --> 01:46:43.015]  Why, everybody needs these chips.
[01:46:43.075 --> 01:46:45.035]  I mean, they're opening the Twilight Zone.
[01:46:45.975 --> 01:46:48.036]  In fact, we've got the Twilight Zone music.
[01:46:48.056 --> 01:46:49.796]  Can you find that, Stephanie, in there and play that?
[01:46:49.836 --> 01:46:50.636]  I think we need to play that.
[01:46:51.334 --> 01:46:52.235]  Yeah, most definitely.
[01:46:52.295 --> 01:47:10.026]  It's gotten to the point where I can't even watch television anymore because I think they should refer to this as the disinformation age because between all the prescription drug commercials and all the propaganda being spewed on the network news and all the network television shows, it just makes me sick nowadays.
[01:47:10.786 --> 01:47:15.309]  And Robert, if we are fad-driven creatures without a compass, moral relativists...
[01:47:16.314 --> 01:47:16.434]  Yeah.
[01:47:16.454 --> 01:47:18.976]  Well, the only reason I woke up was because of you.
[01:47:18.996 --> 01:47:20.377]  I used to watch your show in 99.
[01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:43.195]  And I agreed with some of the stuff, but I never really took the time out to research it.
[01:47:43.275 --> 01:47:48.983]  And then I saw the show you did before September 11th saying that they're going to blow up buildings and call the White House.
[01:47:49.604 --> 01:47:53.270]  And the morning of, you know, it just, everything hit me right then.
[01:47:54.453 --> 01:47:57.335]  Now, you saw that TV show beforehand, did you not?
[01:47:57.655 --> 01:48:05.561]  It's in Masters of Terror, the clip of me saying it, but where I say, call the White House, they're going to probably use Bin Laden as the patsy to attack New York.
[01:48:05.601 --> 01:48:06.701]  Call them, I know they're going to do it.
[01:48:06.981 --> 01:48:22.872]  Yeah, and the morning that it happened, I reminded all my roommates, because, I mean, we would all watch your show beforehand, you know, and sometimes they would tease me about it, you know, because I would watch it, and then I reminded them that you would say it and all that, and it just, you know, hit me like a ton of bricks that morning.
[01:48:23.413 --> 01:48:28.214]  Well, I was able to make that prediction because I watch television and it's selfish and it's bad.
[01:48:28.754 --> 01:48:33.355]  But now I watch almost zero television other than stuff people send me.
[01:48:34.236 --> 01:48:36.756]  And I cannot make myself do it.
[01:48:36.856 --> 01:48:37.616]  It is too painful.
[01:48:38.277 --> 01:48:38.957]  I get a headache.
[01:48:39.617 --> 01:48:40.457]  I get frustrated.
[01:48:41.037 --> 01:48:46.458]  Because whether it's a drama or a news show or it's just all sickening propaganda.
[01:48:47.319 --> 01:48:50.659]  And I just can read the text of what they've said and it's not as painful.
[01:48:51.160 --> 01:48:52.820]  I mean, I did watch a little bit of Ridge.
[01:48:53.837 --> 01:48:57.480]  Up there in front of, you know, last week the terrorists are going to get you with all the Big Brother cameras.
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:09.691]  And, you know, to watch the people guilty of all this, you know, to watch one of the minions of those that are guilty, I should say, you know, to watch, I mean, it's like watching Ted Bundy dance around and tell us how he saved these women.
[01:49:10.591 --> 01:49:12.073]  And, you know, I just can't do it, folks.
[01:49:12.113 --> 01:49:13.534]  I can't watch these people do this.
[01:49:13.574 --> 01:49:15.716]  I just, it just makes me too sick.
[01:49:16.016 --> 01:49:19.399]  The smirking, the laughing, the smiling, it's just, it's too much.
[01:49:19.759 --> 01:49:24.066]  The thing that really cheesed me off was the standing ovation at CIA headquarters.
[01:49:26.246 --> 01:49:31.088]  Yeah, Bush smiling, laughing, tears in the eyes of the CIA for a three-minute standing ovation.
[01:49:31.388 --> 01:49:32.868]  Days after 9-11, the celebration.
[01:49:33.008 --> 01:49:33.709]  Oh, we did it!
[01:49:34.289 --> 01:49:35.249]  Oh, we pulled it off!
[01:49:35.289 --> 01:49:36.970]  These people are going to be our slaves!
[01:49:37.150 --> 01:49:38.030]  Oh, man!
[01:49:38.050 --> 01:49:39.951]  Oh, boy!
[01:49:40.011 --> 01:49:42.071]  The stock's going up in the prison companies!
[01:49:42.311 --> 01:49:43.252]  Oh, we're rich!
[01:49:44.072 --> 01:49:46.573]  Oh, God, it's so good what we've done to them!
[01:49:46.713 --> 01:49:47.493]  Yay!
[01:49:47.513 --> 01:49:47.573]  Yay!
[01:49:48.033 --> 01:49:49.114]  Yay!
[01:49:49.294 --> 01:49:49.354]  Yay!
[01:49:54.204 --> 01:50:01.029]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:01.369 --> 01:50:02.730]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:05.131]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:05.291 --> 01:50:07.373]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:07.653 --> 01:50:12.596]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.916 --> 01:50:16.959]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:17.219 --> 01:50:18.979]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:19.060 --> 01:50:29.702]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and planable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.842 --> 01:50:31.763]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.963 --> 01:50:35.784]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.

[01:50:53.467 --> 01:50:59.692]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:50:59.852 --> 01:51:06.016]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[01:51:06.296 --> 01:51:14.743]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:14.983 --> 01:51:22.008]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:22.308 --> 01:51:27.131]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:27.331 --> 01:51:32.755]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:33.075 --> 01:51:36.157]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:51:36.498 --> 01:51:44.463]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[01:53:01.429 --> 01:53:04.171]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:07.026 --> 01:53:11.608]  All right, Dean and Bolsa and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:53:11.628 --> 01:53:14.228]  We'll get to your calls.
[01:53:14.248 --> 01:53:17.309]  Third hour coming up, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:53:18.350 --> 01:53:22.731]  I want to get into secret film shows, Iraq prisoners sodomized.
[01:53:23.831 --> 01:53:26.372]  This is out of the London Independent, Associated Press, you name it.
[01:53:27.012 --> 01:53:29.353]  Old news for our listeners, but here it is in the mainstream media.
[01:53:30.874 --> 01:53:34.575]  Before I do that, I have made ten documentary films, written a book, published a book.
[01:53:34.595 --> 01:53:35.275]  You know about that.
[01:53:36.505 --> 01:53:37.166]  We're good to go.
[01:53:57.654 --> 01:53:58.734]  I did it here on radio, too.
[01:53:59.334 --> 01:54:00.375]  I said, call the White House.
[01:54:00.515 --> 01:54:03.095]  I didn't just say, oh, Bin Laden's going to attack New York.
[01:54:03.115 --> 01:54:03.735]  They're going to use him.
[01:54:04.096 --> 01:54:04.856]  I said, call the White House.
[01:54:04.876 --> 01:54:05.556]  Tell them don't do it.
[01:54:05.636 --> 01:54:07.716]  I knew they were about to pull it.
[01:54:08.237 --> 01:54:12.077]  From all the evidence, from all the propaganda, from the preparation propaganda, from all of it.
[01:54:12.497 --> 01:54:14.298]  And I'm saying that again this time, by the way.
[01:54:16.999 --> 01:54:19.679]  But, unfortunately, oh boy.
[01:54:19.819 --> 01:54:21.620]  And it's going to be bigger probably, too, by the way.
[01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:22.620]  But...
[01:54:24.562 --> 01:54:25.762]  You need to get these videos.
[01:54:25.802 --> 01:54:27.583]  You need to make copies of my films.
[01:54:27.663 --> 01:54:31.244]  My films you can make copies of and give to people and put them on Axis TV.
[01:54:31.664 --> 01:54:34.124]  You can buy them, the other videos for me that other people have made.
[01:54:34.144 --> 01:54:36.305]  You can't make copies of them because I can't authorize you to do that.
[01:54:36.365 --> 01:54:37.425]  But they're all excellent.
[01:54:38.005 --> 01:54:47.148]  Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order the videos or the books or any of the materials via our SafeScare shopping cart.

[01:54:53.434 --> 01:54:54.014]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:54:54.034 --> 01:54:58.896]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:54:58.956 --> 01:55:01.096]  Take action and expose the murderers, folks.
[01:55:01.316 --> 01:55:04.177]  There's more of us than there are of them.
[01:55:04.357 --> 01:55:06.498]  One mind at a time, expose the killers.
[01:55:06.538 --> 01:55:07.638]  They deserve to be exposed.
[01:55:07.658 --> 01:55:09.518]  And those they killed...
[01:55:23.078 --> 01:55:24.678]  Deserve to have their killers exposed.
[01:55:24.698 --> 01:55:25.179]  Don't you agree?
[01:55:26.619 --> 01:55:34.781]  I remember people on TV and radio saying torture's good, it's needed, and I said it leads to the most degrading stuff you can imagine once you cross that line.
[01:55:35.441 --> 01:55:37.122]  Plus, these aren't even real terrorists to begin with.
[01:55:37.142 --> 01:55:38.082]  This is all staged.
[01:55:38.922 --> 01:55:48.745]  And now they admit that 70-90% of those at the camp were there for stealing biscuits or maybe stealing firewood or families who didn't have their papers in order at checkpoints.
[01:55:50.126 --> 01:55:54.348]  And the Army report admitted raping of women and beating of children in front of their parents.
[01:55:54.408 --> 01:55:58.330]  But then other stuff came out that the government won't release.
[01:55:58.590 --> 01:56:11.797]  And London Independent, young male prisoners were filmed being sodomized by American soldiers at the Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad, according to the journalist who first revealed the abuse there, which the government admits is accurate.
[01:56:11.817 --> 01:56:18.500]  Seymour Hersh, who reported on the torture of the prisoners in New York Magazine, told an audience in San Francisco that it's worse...
[01:56:19.221 --> 01:56:21.383]  We reported this text about two weeks ago, by the way.
[01:56:21.783 --> 01:56:26.367]  But he added that he would reveal the extent of the abuses.
[01:56:26.568 --> 01:56:31.192]  I'm not done reporting on all of this, he told a meeting of the American Civil Liberties Union.
[01:56:31.232 --> 01:56:38.298]  He said the boys were sodomized with the cameras rolling, and the worst part is the soundtrack, the boys shrieking.
[01:56:39.042 --> 01:56:40.803]  And this is your government at war.
[01:56:41.303 --> 01:56:42.004]  You accuse the U.S.
[01:56:42.024 --> 01:56:49.108]  administration and all but accuse President George Bush and Vice President Cheney of complicity in covering up what he called war crimes.
[01:56:50.729 --> 01:56:52.650]  And, of course, they also beat these people to death.
[01:56:52.830 --> 01:56:56.893]  So you and your wife and your children get pulled over at a checkpoint.
[01:56:57.393 --> 01:56:58.674]  It's young girls, too, by the way.
[01:56:58.694 --> 01:56:59.574]  I've got other reports here.
[01:57:00.115 --> 01:57:03.797]  This is just the stuff Hersh has seen.
[01:57:03.817 --> 01:57:05.258]  And you get taken to the camp.
[01:57:06.125 --> 01:57:09.509]  And a bunch of demonic creatures, former prison guards from the U.S.
[01:57:09.529 --> 01:57:11.071]  do this to you, and this is freedom.
[01:57:11.331 --> 01:57:11.932]  This is good.
[01:57:13.273 --> 01:57:17.698]  Because, see, once you dehumanize somebody, then you can do this to them.
[01:57:17.958 --> 01:57:18.559]  So, no, no, no.
[01:57:18.639 --> 01:57:19.660]  This is pure evil.
[01:57:19.941 --> 01:57:21.442]  But some people say this is good.
[01:57:21.462 --> 01:57:23.064]  Let me just tell you something.
[01:57:23.425 --> 01:57:25.106]  There is a hell, and you're going to it.
[01:57:25.787 --> 01:57:27.349]  You've got a one-way ticket.
[01:57:29.131 --> 01:57:31.013]  So just keep it up, you sick filth.
[01:57:31.213 --> 01:57:32.874]  You trash of the earth.
[01:57:33.275 --> 01:57:34.976]  And by the way, they got these 32 other camps.
[01:57:34.996 --> 01:57:36.978]  They got all these new secret camps we've learned of.
[01:57:37.858 --> 01:57:40.120]  I mean, folks, they're torturing people to death.
[01:57:40.481 --> 01:57:41.401]  Third hour coming up.
[01:57:50.429 --> 01:57:51.089]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.730 --> 01:57:52.831]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.511 --> 01:57:54.632]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:55.273 --> 01:57:56.093]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.834 --> 01:57:57.615]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:58.366 --> 01:58:02.229]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.569 --> 01:58:06.671]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:07.672 --> 01:58:08.973]  That's right, my friends.
[01:58:09.193 --> 01:58:15.477]  Already into our number three of this live 16th Day of July edition.
[01:58:17.336 --> 01:58:18.576]  Wide open telephones.
[01:58:18.756 --> 01:58:20.757]  Don't even think I gave the number out in the last hour.
[01:58:20.857 --> 01:58:22.157]  It's got a few lines open.
[01:58:22.177 --> 01:58:24.878]  You've had trouble getting in in the past.
[01:58:24.898 --> 01:58:25.798]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:25.818 --> 01:58:26.419]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:26.739 --> 01:58:40.002]  I want to get into the Second Amendment more on coming out in the mainstream media about raping children at the prisons in Iraq.
[01:58:40.082 --> 01:58:43.423]  So I think all of those out there that promoted torture is a good thing.
[01:58:43.503 --> 01:58:45.124]  I hope you're proud of yourselves now.
[01:58:45.928 --> 01:58:47.089]  Probably sure you still are.
[01:58:47.129 --> 01:58:48.410]  I've heard people making excuses.
[01:58:48.710 --> 01:58:49.811]  You're a bunch of sick trash.
[01:58:50.652 --> 01:59:00.439]  But we'll also get more into the TIPS program, Back on Steroids, for the exterminator, the cable man, to spy on you in your house for terror and crime.
[01:59:00.960 --> 01:59:03.722]  China bans abortion based on baby's gender.
[01:59:05.198 --> 01:59:07.599]  And just so much more that's going to be coming up.
[01:59:07.719 --> 01:59:10.961]  Right now, let's go to Denmark, then we'll talk to Tawana in Kentucky.
[01:59:11.261 --> 01:59:13.602]  But right now, Malta in Denmark.
[01:59:13.883 --> 01:59:16.224]  I got a call from Deutschland today, now from Denmark.
[01:59:16.604 --> 01:59:17.404]  Welcome, Malta.
[01:59:17.865 --> 01:59:19.485]  I tried to call yesterday.
[01:59:19.505 --> 01:59:26.229]  Well, you mentioned saying the Bilderberg is the highest level of the New World.
[01:59:26.849 --> 01:59:27.910]  I don't think that's true.
[01:59:28.470 --> 01:59:28.770]  Okay.
[01:59:30.051 --> 01:59:31.051]  Why don't you think that's true?
[01:59:31.071 --> 01:59:34.453]  They're the people in the shadow.
[01:59:36.067 --> 01:59:47.475]  I mean, the people you don't know, I mean... Well... If George Bush makes a mistake, they will kill him, like they killed Kennedy.
[01:59:47.495 --> 01:59:52.018]  I mean... If you know what I mean.
[01:59:54.320 --> 02:00:00.304]  Well, I mean, we hope nothing ever bad happens to Bush, because he's just a puppet, but I'm trying to understand what you're saying.
[02:00:00.344 --> 02:00:03.306]  You're saying... I say the big guys who really...
[02:00:07.561 --> 02:00:17.864]  Well, I'm not saying every person that goes to Bilderberg is the tip of the yacht, you know, the most powerful, the paramount.
[02:00:18.464 --> 02:00:23.125]  But certainly the paramount individuals, a few dozen of them, are there, sir.
[02:00:23.165 --> 02:00:26.746]  The British Queen, the Dutch royalty.
[02:00:27.786 --> 02:00:30.767]  You've got the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers.
[02:00:31.457 --> 02:00:33.779]  Our chance is probably close to the top.
[02:00:34.079 --> 02:00:35.200]  Well, yeah, they are, sir.
[02:00:35.240 --> 02:00:36.961]  They're about as high as you get.
[02:00:37.521 --> 02:00:50.631]  So... There are some people we only... Well, they've kept it secret for five decades, and now they're just announcing it, and, yes, we picked your vice presidents, and ha, ha, ha, because we've exposed them.
[02:00:50.671 --> 02:00:54.014]  They're now having to come out of the shadows.
[02:00:54.034 --> 02:00:58.637]  I really hope this is going to... I don't like this European Constitution.
[02:00:59.778 --> 02:01:02.399]  Well, it certainly strips you of what rights you had left.
[02:01:02.419 --> 02:01:05.781]  I think it would destroy our Constitution.
[02:01:08.142 --> 02:01:08.903]  We still have that.
[02:01:09.823 --> 02:01:14.545]  Well, most people who've been against it, you know, in Europe, but still they don't care.
[02:01:14.585 --> 02:01:15.946]  They just enforce it on you, don't they?
[02:01:16.646 --> 02:01:23.850]  Yeah, but, you know, most people who's against it, they are on the right.
[02:01:23.870 --> 02:01:25.251]  I mean, they're liberals.
[02:01:26.031 --> 02:01:26.832]  What do you call it?
[02:01:27.072 --> 02:01:27.472]  Liberals.
[02:01:28.192 --> 02:01:29.113]  They're modern liberals.
[02:01:29.213 --> 02:01:29.493]  They're
[02:01:30.063 --> 02:01:32.705]  Well, of course they are, yeah.
[02:01:33.426 --> 02:01:33.566]  Yeah.
[02:01:33.586 --> 02:01:38.650]  And then the socialists are just loyal opposition, controlled opposition.
[02:01:58.894 --> 02:02:00.635]  Yeah, but I don't know.
[02:02:00.655 --> 02:02:03.496]  I have seen Norway.
[02:02:04.036 --> 02:02:05.976]  They're not a member of the European Union.
[02:02:06.056 --> 02:02:08.557]  They're still in control by the New World Order.
[02:02:09.138 --> 02:02:16.000]  Maybe, I don't know how much, how better it's being if we get out of this European Union.
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:17.821]  I hear you.
[02:02:17.861 --> 02:02:20.441]  Hey, good to have your call from Denmark, Malte.
[02:02:20.461 --> 02:02:20.822]  Take care.
[02:02:22.862 --> 02:02:23.823]  Other callers, stay there.
[02:02:23.843 --> 02:02:24.743]  We'll get to you when we get back.
[02:02:25.612 --> 02:02:28.757]  Pick a lot of calls in this third hour at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:28.797 --> 02:02:33.705]  Any news item, any point you want to raise, a lot of great points have been brought up by callers.
[02:02:34.105 --> 02:02:36.148]  And a bunch of other news I haven't even gotten to yet.
[02:02:36.629 --> 02:02:38.272]  So be sure and stay with us.
[02:02:38.552 --> 02:02:39.814]  We'll be right back, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:02:46.016 --> 02:02:48.837]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[02:02:48.957 --> 02:02:49.798]  Michael Trudeau here.
[02:02:49.918 --> 02:02:53.219]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[02:02:53.419 --> 02:02:59.062]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[02:02:59.202 --> 02:03:02.223]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[02:03:02.483 --> 02:03:06.766]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[02:03:06.966 --> 02:03:08.867]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[02:03:08.987 --> 02:03:16.052]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again, with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[02:03:16.252 --> 02:03:18.714]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[02:03:18.954 --> 02:03:19.595]  We're good to go.
[02:03:19.615 --> 02:03:20.015]  We're good to go.
[02:03:45.968 --> 02:03:46.708]  Terrorism.
[02:03:46.888 --> 02:03:47.629]  Terrorism.
[02:03:47.749 --> 02:03:48.589]  Chemical attacks.
[02:03:48.649 --> 02:03:49.310]  Dirty bombs.
[02:03:49.410 --> 02:03:49.830]  Fallout.
[02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:50.910]  Biological attack.
[02:03:51.090 --> 02:03:51.631]  And threats.
[02:03:51.691 --> 02:03:53.812]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[02:03:54.072 --> 02:03:55.653]  Alarming words for our time.
[02:03:55.893 --> 02:03:58.374]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[02:03:58.774 --> 02:04:13.341]  The video, Shiltering in Place, Surviving Acts of Terrorism from Biological, Chemical, and Radioactive Fallout, was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:04:13.381 --> 02:04:13.701]  government.
[02:04:13.861 --> 02:04:15.662]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[02:04:16.042 --> 02:04:21.963]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[02:04:22.083 --> 02:04:26.604]  If you're not the type who waits until it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[02:04:26.844 --> 02:04:33.566]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and call them Alex Jones sent you.

[02:04:45.973 --> 02:04:48.914]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[02:04:49.575 --> 02:04:50.855]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:04:51.075 --> 02:04:56.818]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:04:57.078 --> 02:05:02.341]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[02:05:02.621 --> 02:05:06.743]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:05:06.943 --> 02:05:10.727]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:05:10.988 --> 02:05:15.633]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:05:15.713 --> 02:05:21.980]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:05:22.020 --> 02:05:23.862]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:05:24.322 --> 02:05:26.405]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[02:05:26.505 --> 02:05:29.869]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.

[02:05:40.380 --> 02:05:41.902]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:05:42.082 --> 02:05:44.165]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[02:05:47.159 --> 02:05:53.183]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:05:53.783 --> 02:05:56.826]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:58.567 --> 02:06:01.008]  All right, let's go fast to your phone calls.
[02:06:01.268 --> 02:06:03.990]  I believe it's Tamara in Kentucky.
[02:06:04.010 --> 02:06:04.571]  You're on the air.
[02:06:04.631 --> 02:06:05.051]  Go ahead.
[02:06:06.432 --> 02:06:06.872]  Hello?
[02:06:07.252 --> 02:06:07.913]  Yes, welcome.
[02:06:09.714 --> 02:06:10.635]  Thank you for holding, ma'am.
[02:06:10.655 --> 02:06:11.315]  You're on the air.
[02:06:11.976 --> 02:06:13.096]  I was holding for Linda.
[02:06:14.998 --> 02:06:15.358]  Okay.
[02:06:17.025 --> 02:06:17.966]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:06:17.986 --> 02:06:19.187]  You call the radio show?
[02:06:25.191 --> 02:06:27.033]  That caller's been holding for like 30 minutes.
[02:06:27.774 --> 02:06:28.855]  Ma'am, thank you for the call.
[02:06:28.915 --> 02:06:29.455]  I appreciate it.
[02:06:29.475 --> 02:06:29.835]  Take care.
[02:06:31.897 --> 02:06:32.217]  You know what?
[02:06:32.237 --> 02:06:36.301]  I think somebody went away from the phone and they gave it to somebody because I think I heard the person actually come and get on the phone.
[02:06:37.702 --> 02:06:40.224]  Somebody was taking care of kids and had to leave for a second.
[02:06:40.994 --> 02:06:43.355]  You can call back from Kentucky if you can get in.
[02:06:43.835 --> 02:06:44.936]  Norm in Colorado.
[02:06:45.016 --> 02:06:46.037]  Norm, you're on the air.
[02:06:46.097 --> 02:06:46.597]  Go ahead.
[02:06:46.757 --> 02:06:47.597]  Yes, hello, Alex.
[02:06:47.797 --> 02:06:48.118]  Yes, sir.
[02:06:48.458 --> 02:06:51.319]  Just quickly, you follow your gut feelings, you say?
[02:06:52.139 --> 02:06:55.441]  Well, I go off the facts, and then I go with my gut after that.
[02:06:56.061 --> 02:07:03.705]  And something troubling me, and here in our state, the troops they brought back to Fort Carson...
[02:07:04.656 --> 02:07:12.079]  They shipped all the equipment back, and one of my neighbors happens to be involved in the inventory and so forth of the stuff coming back.
[02:07:12.779 --> 02:07:19.442]  Now they've announced that just in a few months they're going to be sending them back over to the Middle East again, which all the equipment will be going back the other way, right?
[02:07:20.122 --> 02:07:20.422]  Yes.
[02:07:21.303 --> 02:07:28.425]  And I just wonder, my gut feeling on this thing, is this thing the final dress rehearsal before they bring it to the streets of America?
[02:07:28.786 --> 02:07:29.726]  It's going on in Iraq.
[02:07:31.607 --> 02:07:50.940]  Well, we have Army training manuals and reports that say all this urban warfare training globally from Macedonia to Africa, all over the globe, in Iraq, you name it, in Serbia, is a great training system for here domestically.
[02:07:52.401 --> 02:07:55.763]  Do you think that it's at our front door?
[02:07:55.803 --> 02:07:59.766]  This would be the last dress rehearsal before they make their big push here?
[02:08:01.467 --> 02:08:07.929]  I have to say, I mean, they're on the news training us to accept military on the streets.
[02:08:07.969 --> 02:08:09.489]  They've been getting us ready for it.
[02:08:09.969 --> 02:08:15.251]  So certainly that is a preparation, but I don't think the people are buying it so that may hold them back.
[02:08:15.311 --> 02:08:19.432]  As soon as they think we'll accept a new level of tyranny, they will launch it.
[02:08:20.172 --> 02:08:24.013]  They don't think the troops will go along with this unless they have a proper domestic crisis plan.
[02:08:24.463 --> 02:08:25.544]  We're good to go.
[02:08:41.150 --> 02:08:44.353]  Certainly there is preparations for martial law and domestic takeover.
[02:08:44.613 --> 02:08:45.414]  That's been admitted.
[02:08:46.134 --> 02:08:53.700]  And back in the late 90s, I mean, I went to training drills with the military and videoed it where they were trying to arrest Americans and take our guns.
[02:08:54.081 --> 02:08:55.002]  So that's no secret.
[02:08:55.042 --> 02:08:58.685]  That training's been going on since the late 1980s that we know of.
[02:08:58.885 --> 02:09:01.747]  Yeah, we know they can start a crisis in a 24-hour period.
[02:09:01.807 --> 02:09:06.171]  That idiot that bought the trade towers now, I understand, owns Sears Towers.
[02:09:06.211 --> 02:09:07.652]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:09:08.292 --> 02:09:08.473]  I mean...
[02:09:09.258 --> 02:09:12.220]  He's not too big an idiot on $200 million investment.
[02:09:12.240 --> 02:09:13.321]  He's made over $3 billion.
[02:09:13.341 --> 02:09:14.102]  How about that?
[02:09:14.122 --> 02:09:14.862]  Yeah.
[02:09:15.122 --> 02:09:17.804]  I just got a gut feeling I'm sick of my stomach over this.
[02:09:17.864 --> 02:09:21.487]  I think it's the last dress rehearsal, I think, is what's going on over there.
[02:09:23.604 --> 02:09:24.565]  Well, you never know.
[02:09:25.486 --> 02:09:37.516]  When the globalists went in against Noriega for six months before, they had helicopters do touch-and-goes and drills to acclimate, and then finally when they struck, the Panamanians thought it was another drill.
[02:09:37.836 --> 02:09:46.864]  It's the same thing with Delta forces doing training drills, urban warfare, black helicopter drills, unannounced terrorizing every major city I know of in the last decade.
[02:09:47.265 --> 02:09:48.606]  That is to acclimate for that.
[02:09:48.906 --> 02:09:57.252]  Yeah, they have to be a bunch of stupid people, these alumens, because there's about 16 million people out here that... We haven't done it in a long time, but we were trained to.
[02:09:59.114 --> 02:09:59.974]  And we're not afraid of them.
[02:10:02.056 --> 02:10:03.857]  Well, I think that's really how it works.
[02:10:03.897 --> 02:10:08.080]  You know, once you've been in a fight a few times, you're not really that afraid to get in a fight.
[02:10:08.320 --> 02:10:11.203]  I'm just afraid of the consequences of getting into the fight.
[02:10:11.863 --> 02:10:12.964]  I'm not afraid of the fight.
[02:10:14.085 --> 02:10:16.446]  And it's just...
[02:10:18.064 --> 02:10:22.210]  I mean, I've never been in a war, but Dallas was pretty rough growing up, and I got in a lot of fights.
[02:10:22.790 --> 02:10:27.357]  After you've been in a few fights with a few big, mean guys, you really weren't worried about it the next time it happened.
[02:10:27.917 --> 02:10:35.107]  And I wouldn't imagine the real tough guys and people that are trained out there that know what they're doing, and I know there's millions of them.
[02:10:35.843 --> 02:10:38.825]  And, you know, the question is, what is their line in the sand?
[02:10:39.025 --> 02:10:43.227]  I don't want this physical confrontation to take place because we haven't woken up enough people yet.
[02:10:43.387 --> 02:10:46.489]  I want to try to avert it, but it looks like they're not going to let us avert it.
[02:10:47.790 --> 02:10:50.111]  I mean, do you talk to your former military friends?
[02:10:50.151 --> 02:10:50.951]  I mean, what are they saying?
[02:10:51.612 --> 02:10:58.996]  Well, they all have these same gut feelings, and everybody's just sitting back with their hands folded in their lap and waiting because we're all law-abiding citizens.
[02:10:59.016 --> 02:11:00.497]  We're not going to create anarchy.
[02:11:00.537 --> 02:11:01.117]  We're going to wait.
[02:11:01.457 --> 02:11:02.458]  When it comes to our door...
[02:11:03.274 --> 02:11:03.934]  We'll deal with it.
[02:11:04.014 --> 02:11:04.895]  We built America.
[02:11:05.095 --> 02:11:09.016]  These idiot people at the top, they didn't build it.
[02:11:09.496 --> 02:11:11.977]  And if we tear it up, we'll have to build it back, and we know how.
[02:11:14.298 --> 02:11:20.761]  Well, you know, don't think the globalists also won't sit over in Europe calling it a civil war when they manipulated it.
[02:11:21.750 --> 02:11:26.854]  And I want the police and military and FBI to know the globalists think of you as nothing.
[02:11:26.894 --> 02:11:32.539]  And it would be real funny to them watching you going up against, let's say, 16 million veterans is a good number you bring.
[02:11:32.819 --> 02:11:34.100]  Let's say a million fight.
[02:11:34.821 --> 02:11:42.807]  And that's a million guerrillas, which is better than 10 million if you were to bring in 10 million people to try to subdue them.
[02:11:43.453 --> 02:11:44.113]  We're good to go.
[02:11:44.133 --> 02:11:44.273]  I think?
[02:12:06.722 --> 02:12:10.446]  But again, that's going to knock out the Rome people while they're knocking us out.
[02:12:10.926 --> 02:12:16.451]  And I just hope, I hope up in their ivory towers, these pinheads don't think they're really going to get away with this.
[02:12:16.832 --> 02:12:18.353]  They're going to have to leave this country.
[02:12:18.413 --> 02:12:20.735]  They're protégés that are here.
[02:12:20.915 --> 02:12:23.698]  And when we're done here, we will certainly go to the European continent.
[02:12:23.738 --> 02:12:26.761]  That's what my friends are saying in private.
[02:12:26.821 --> 02:12:28.983]  They were saying when we're done here, we're going to have to go ahead.
[02:12:29.023 --> 02:12:31.225]  We've got to kill all of the snakes, not just one or two of them.
[02:12:33.064 --> 02:12:34.025]  All right, Norm.
[02:12:34.085 --> 02:12:34.565]  Good to hear.
[02:12:34.765 --> 02:12:37.147]  Norm, what branch of the military were you in?
[02:12:37.708 --> 02:12:39.870]  I served in the Air Force.
[02:12:41.231 --> 02:12:42.972]  I'd rather not go there and discuss some of that.
[02:12:43.293 --> 02:12:43.913]  No, I hear you.
[02:12:44.794 --> 02:12:47.236]  And your friends, they just serve in different branches?
[02:12:47.416 --> 02:12:49.117]  Yeah.
[02:12:49.618 --> 02:12:50.679]  They're all representative.
[02:12:50.699 --> 02:12:57.124]  Right here within seven miles of me, there's probably 5,000 that we communicate occasionally.
[02:12:58.452 --> 02:13:00.313]  And so they know Bush isn't a conservative.
[02:13:00.353 --> 02:13:01.774]  They know it's all a stage event.
[02:13:02.135 --> 02:13:03.976]  I don't believe he's a Christian either.
[02:13:05.176 --> 02:13:06.577]  All right, good to hear from you, my friend.
[02:13:06.777 --> 02:13:08.358]  You know, I hope this doesn't happen.
[02:13:08.418 --> 02:13:09.619]  I hope this can all be averted.
[02:13:11.300 --> 02:13:13.502]  Because my family means nothing to the globalists.
[02:13:13.542 --> 02:13:14.822]  Your family means nothing to them.
[02:13:15.703 --> 02:13:17.844]  Police out there, they don't like you either.
[02:13:17.864 --> 02:13:23.828]  I mean, an example of this is they've now charged three people who were ordered to torture.
[02:13:25.023 --> 02:13:30.628]  I mean, these aren't the idiot troops putting underwear on people's heads or, you know, sickos raping people.
[02:13:30.668 --> 02:13:33.991]  This is torturing people to death in a scientific fashion.
[02:13:34.452 --> 02:13:39.856]  They've charged three of them with the Patriot Act so they can't speak out and defend themselves and say they were ordered to do it.
[02:13:40.137 --> 02:13:41.418]  So it'll be secret trials.
[02:13:42.739 --> 02:13:45.361]  I mean, they put cancer viruses in your vaccines too, police.
[02:13:46.062 --> 02:13:47.904]  They put fluoride in your water, FBI.
[02:13:47.924 --> 02:13:51.507]  And don't laugh at me and say, you know, come on, read the medical reports.
[02:13:52.165 --> 02:13:53.266]  I'm your friend, okay?
[02:13:53.726 --> 02:13:54.106]  Stop it.
[02:13:54.646 --> 02:13:55.827]  I know deep down you're a friend.
[02:13:55.847 --> 02:13:57.808]  You know this is all true, and you've checked out what we've said.
[02:13:58.248 --> 02:14:02.089]  And so you've decided to join this system and just try to go along to get along.
[02:14:04.430 --> 02:14:06.251]  You better decide which side you're on.
[02:14:10.353 --> 02:14:13.394]  Okay, Mark just hung up, so we'll go to Dino in Texas.
[02:14:13.434 --> 02:14:14.215]  Dino, go ahead.
[02:14:14.235 --> 02:14:16.336]  Are you sure?
[02:14:16.356 --> 02:14:16.596]  Yeah.
[02:14:17.256 --> 02:14:19.277]  Let's put him on hold so he can turn his radio off.
[02:14:20.123 --> 02:14:20.543]  Yeah, Alex?
[02:14:21.023 --> 02:14:21.323]  Yes, sir.
[02:14:22.304 --> 02:14:23.224]  Okay, put him on hold.
[02:14:23.504 --> 02:14:24.184]  Put him on hold.
[02:14:24.885 --> 02:14:30.466]  Or whatever radio or whatever that thing is in the background, please turn it off.
[02:14:30.907 --> 02:14:32.687]  As soon as it's turned off, we'll bring you back.
[02:14:32.747 --> 02:14:33.147]  Is it off?
[02:14:33.648 --> 02:14:34.048]  Yeah, it's off.
[02:14:34.248 --> 02:14:34.808]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:14:35.628 --> 02:14:38.369]  Okay, have you ever heard of Bill Hughes?
[02:14:40.370 --> 02:14:41.010]  Hello?
[02:14:41.110 --> 02:14:43.031]  Bellevue Mental Hospital in New York City?
[02:14:43.531 --> 02:14:43.991]  No, no, no.
[02:14:44.051 --> 02:14:46.192]  Bill Hughes.
[02:14:46.272 --> 02:14:46.752]  He's a writer.
[02:14:48.676 --> 02:14:50.698]  Your phone's... Bill what?
[02:14:51.318 --> 02:14:51.579]  Hughes.
[02:14:52.179 --> 02:14:54.961]  Hughes, okay.
[02:14:55.322 --> 02:14:57.664]  The name rings a bell, but Hughes is a common name.
[02:14:57.684 --> 02:14:58.204]  What's going on?
[02:14:58.504 --> 02:14:59.605]  Well, he's got this book.
[02:14:59.685 --> 02:15:02.648]  It's The Enemy Unmasked.
[02:15:02.688 --> 02:15:03.689]  Can I read a little section?
[02:15:03.949 --> 02:15:04.529]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:15:05.150 --> 02:15:15.759]  Okay, it says, while it's clear that the Illuminati and the international bankers are one and the same, we need to be very clear that both these entities are simply fronts or organizations for the Jesuit order.
[02:15:16.394 --> 02:15:19.897]  Again, the Illuminati was founded by Adam Weiskopf in 1776.
[02:15:20.818 --> 02:15:28.104]  Weiskopf was teaching Catholic canon law in a Jesuit university in the Jesuit stronghold of Germany known as Bavaria.
[02:15:28.685 --> 02:15:33.709]  These fundamental principles of the Illuminati are Jesuit-inspired and devised.
[02:15:34.470 --> 02:15:35.471]  Let me ask you a question.
[02:15:35.591 --> 02:15:42.597]  Why would the Jesuits overthrow France, a Catholic country, and a Catholic monarch?
[02:15:43.838 --> 02:15:44.078]  Thanks.
[02:15:45.061 --> 02:15:51.646]  They have their reasons, and I have no clue, but these... Well, look, let me just stop you for a second.
[02:15:52.026 --> 02:15:52.226]  Yeah.
[02:15:52.627 --> 02:15:53.747]  Okay, I'm not Catholic.
[02:15:53.827 --> 02:15:55.008]  I have a lot of friends that are Catholic.
[02:15:55.028 --> 02:15:56.809]  The Catholic Church is thoroughly corrupt.
[02:15:56.849 --> 02:15:59.832]  The Pope is thoroughly out of control, calling for world government.
[02:16:00.772 --> 02:16:04.975]  But I do not believe it is the Catholics running the New World Order.
[02:16:05.075 --> 02:16:06.176]  From study.
[02:16:06.917 --> 02:16:09.118]  From study.
[02:16:09.198 --> 02:16:10.999]  Have the globalists taken over the Catholic Church?
[02:16:12.420 --> 02:16:13.861]  Is it a tool of the New World Order?
[02:16:14.022 --> 02:16:14.462]  Certainly.
[02:16:15.091 --> 02:16:16.653]  But is it the root?
[02:16:17.673 --> 02:16:19.155]  I don't think Jews are the root.
[02:16:19.315 --> 02:16:20.696]  I don't think Catholics are the root.
[02:16:22.098 --> 02:16:24.380]  Satanists are the root.
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:37.131]  Now, do they put on different robes, different disguises, different veils, different envelopes or shields or foils?
[02:16:37.872 --> 02:16:39.133]  Certainly they do.
[02:16:39.153 --> 02:16:39.213]  But...
[02:16:42.179 --> 02:16:45.901]  I do not believe that the Jesuit order runs the New World order.
[02:16:47.402 --> 02:16:50.925]  Well, I'll send you a copy of his book.
[02:16:51.485 --> 02:16:55.167]  No, I'm familiar with the Black Pope and all that stuff.
[02:16:55.187 --> 02:16:56.068]  Go ahead and send it to me.
[02:16:56.248 --> 02:16:57.609]  He's got great info on him.
[02:16:57.649 --> 02:16:58.970]  I'm sure you'd be interested in it.
[02:17:00.451 --> 02:17:01.872]  Well, maybe I should interview him.
[02:17:01.892 --> 02:17:03.513]  I'm always open to other information.
[02:17:03.613 --> 02:17:10.297]  I've looked at it, and why would the Illuminati go around overthrowing Catholic institutions?
[02:17:11.038 --> 02:17:11.538]  I don't know, but...
[02:17:12.199 --> 02:17:14.700]  This guy, supposedly, he's, like, on the run.
[02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:18.501]  So he was, like, you know, they're, like, after him.
[02:17:18.801 --> 02:17:19.942]  You know what I mean?
[02:17:19.962 --> 02:17:20.122]  Yeah.
[02:17:20.922 --> 02:17:22.102]  I'll have to check into that.
[02:17:22.703 --> 02:17:22.983]  All right.
[02:17:23.183 --> 02:17:24.683]  Well, I'll send you a copy of his book either way.
[02:17:24.963 --> 02:17:26.204]  Hey, Dino, great call.
[02:17:26.224 --> 02:17:26.824]  Appreciate it.
[02:17:26.844 --> 02:17:27.984]  I'm sorry I griped at you earlier.
[02:17:28.024 --> 02:17:29.145]  I just can't have the radio up.
[02:17:29.585 --> 02:17:31.145]  We'll be back with more calls, more news, 800-259-9231.
[02:17:31.165 --> 02:17:32.046]  Infowars.com is the website.
[02:17:47.415 --> 02:17:51.917]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[02:17:52.277 --> 02:17:56.359]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[02:17:56.659 --> 02:17:57.199]  We listened.
[02:17:57.519 --> 02:18:02.502]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[02:18:02.762 --> 02:18:03.242]  We listened.
[02:18:03.642 --> 02:18:06.683]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[02:18:07.104 --> 02:18:07.604]  We listened.
[02:18:08.084 --> 02:18:08.585]  We're good to go.
[02:18:08.605 --> 02:18:08.785]  I think?
[02:18:37.371 --> 02:18:38.994]  That's toll-free 888-803-4438.
[02:18:39.014 --> 02:18:40.637]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:18:46.292 --> 02:18:47.272]  It's finally here.
[02:18:47.412 --> 02:18:48.413]  Spring has arrived.
[02:18:48.593 --> 02:18:51.553]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:18:51.773 --> 02:18:55.234]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:18:55.434 --> 02:19:03.596]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand-new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.

[02:20:48.687 --> 02:20:52.511]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[02:20:52.851 --> 02:20:53.652]  Read the labels.
[02:20:54.092 --> 02:20:58.216]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:20:58.436 --> 02:21:02.621]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[02:21:03.001 --> 02:21:07.866]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[02:21:08.246 --> 02:21:11.848]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.

[02:22:13.868 --> 02:22:19.210]  Let's go ahead and talk to Howie in, is it Illinois or Indiana?
[02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:21.051]  It's Illinois.
[02:22:21.211 --> 02:22:21.911]  Welcome, sir.
[02:22:22.451 --> 02:22:23.271]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:22:24.912 --> 02:22:31.555]  CBS 2, 60 Minutes 2 on Wednesday, talked about Bohemian Grove.
[02:22:32.455 --> 02:22:34.536]  No, they talked about the date
[02:22:35.066 --> 02:22:37.808]  Grateful Dead returning to San Francisco.
[02:22:37.908 --> 02:22:40.451]  Hate Ashbury after 30 years.
[02:22:41.471 --> 02:22:44.894]  And Thursday, the Wall Street Journal front page.
[02:22:45.855 --> 02:22:47.777]  Oh, hey man, grow.
[02:22:48.858 --> 02:22:50.479]  So you are right on.
[02:22:50.639 --> 02:22:55.383]  So who's going to be the headline singer?
[02:22:56.604 --> 02:23:00.087]  They interviewed the lead guitar and talked about him.
[02:23:00.107 --> 02:23:03.190]  The Grateful Dead are entertaining.
[02:23:05.015 --> 02:23:10.996]  At your fourth year anniversary of your video on Bohemian Grove.
[02:23:11.196 --> 02:23:12.177]  You know what's incredible?
[02:23:13.017 --> 02:23:17.878]  I'm getting emails and calls about this Wall Street Journal yesterday I didn't see.
[02:23:18.018 --> 02:23:21.019]  And you're saying Tuesday's 60 Minutes?
[02:23:21.279 --> 02:23:23.699]  Wednesday is 60 Minutes 2.
[02:23:24.660 --> 02:23:28.000]  They did a huge interview.
[02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:29.421]  Did somebody take this?
[02:23:30.361 --> 02:23:30.781]  I didn't.
[02:23:31.756 --> 02:23:33.818]  Oh, I'm begging people to get me a copy of that.
[02:23:34.078 --> 02:23:36.760]  It was marvelous, but... Did they show the owl?
[02:23:36.780 --> 02:23:37.901]  Did they admit the rituals?
[02:23:38.102 --> 02:23:45.968]  No, 60 Minutes didn't even mention Bohemian Grove or the fact that the Grateful Dead were going to be the entertainment.
[02:23:46.429 --> 02:23:47.950]  Okay, I thought you said 60 Minutes did.
[02:23:48.430 --> 02:23:52.094]  No, it was the Wall Street Journal who exposed it.
[02:23:53.475 --> 02:23:57.138]  The writer from the Wall Street Journal talked about
[02:23:58.458 --> 02:24:03.141]  They soft-pedal what they do at Bohemian Grove.
[02:24:03.842 --> 02:24:05.063]  So what did 60 Minutes do?
[02:24:05.563 --> 02:24:13.929]  They did the fact that after 30 years, the Grateful Dead band had returned to Ashbury in San Francisco.
[02:24:15.771 --> 02:24:17.192]  And how they became...
[02:24:18.708 --> 02:24:22.489]  The most popular touring musicians in this country.
[02:24:22.649 --> 02:24:26.790]  But then meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal says they were really there for the Bohemian Grove.
[02:24:26.870 --> 02:24:28.011]  That's right.
[02:24:28.951 --> 02:24:32.092]  But my point is... Why do you think this is all coming out now?
[02:24:32.372 --> 02:24:39.974]  Well, if you consider the Grateful Dead, anyone who ever heard them never hears the same music again.
[02:24:41.474 --> 02:24:41.994]  It's dead.
[02:24:42.094 --> 02:24:47.656]  What you heard at a Grateful Dead show is the last time you will hear that music.
[02:24:48.533 --> 02:24:53.654]  Because each show that they have put on is impromptu.
[02:24:57.715 --> 02:25:02.996]  And this is what has caused them to just confound the critics.
[02:25:03.616 --> 02:25:11.938]  How can they be the most listened to touring band in the world and not play the same tune again?
[02:25:12.058 --> 02:25:14.218]  Well, that's their name, the Grateful Dead.
[02:25:15.198 --> 02:25:17.679]  They are musicians of finest.
[02:25:19.775 --> 02:25:28.359]  Well, all I know is Bohemian Grove goes on for 15 days, and they do have top Hollywood people and musicians come in, basically like they're servants.
[02:25:28.679 --> 02:25:29.039]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:29.159 --> 02:25:30.600]  And they're paid to come in, by the way.
[02:25:30.820 --> 02:25:31.260]  Yes, sir.
[02:25:32.381 --> 02:25:36.483]  That's what 60 Minutes, that's what the Wall Street Journal said.
[02:25:36.723 --> 02:25:43.406]  Yeah, but... But the 60 Minutes was only the fact that for 30 years, these guys had never gone back to San Francisco.
[02:25:46.098 --> 02:25:47.299]  And now they're coming back.
[02:25:47.419 --> 02:25:53.643]  And now they have come back, and the reason was in the next day, Thursday's Wall Street Journal, why they're back.
[02:25:54.463 --> 02:25:59.546]  Which is because Bohemian Grove is just 60 miles north of San Francisco.
[02:25:59.686 --> 02:26:00.767]  That's right, I've been there.
[02:26:01.127 --> 02:26:09.292]  But you are right on, and a previous caller today, the Air Force veteran, was right on the money.
[02:26:10.433 --> 02:26:15.096]  Two weeks after we invaded Iraq, I was at my gun store...
[02:26:16.036 --> 02:26:22.762]  And I was coming out, and these veterans were talking about what they would be doing on a rat.
[02:26:23.463 --> 02:26:26.085]  And I said, I interrupted.
[02:26:26.145 --> 02:26:28.487]  I said, do you people realize what's going on?
[02:26:28.567 --> 02:26:31.850]  I said, these guys are being trained to go after us.
[02:26:32.290 --> 02:26:36.854]  And all these old veterans looked at me and just sort of chuckled and said, you're nuts.
[02:26:38.376 --> 02:26:42.178]  But I think your caller was right, and I think you're right on.
[02:26:42.698 --> 02:26:43.599]  All right, good to hear from you.
[02:26:43.619 --> 02:26:44.459]  I appreciate the call.
[02:26:45.360 --> 02:26:48.902]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in New Jersey.
[02:26:48.962 --> 02:26:49.682]  Brian, go ahead.
[02:26:49.862 --> 02:26:50.222]  Hey, Alex.
[02:26:50.302 --> 02:26:51.303]  Always an honor to talk to you.
[02:26:51.503 --> 02:26:52.363]  You bet.
[02:26:53.344 --> 02:26:55.065]  I talk to pretty much everybody about this.
[02:26:55.085 --> 02:26:56.386]  There's nobody that I don't talk to.
[02:26:56.406 --> 02:26:59.827]  If they bring up politics, boom, this is instantaneous my conversation.
[02:26:59.887 --> 02:27:00.668]  My biggest thing is,
[02:27:01.249 --> 02:27:14.685]  Is that even after I've convinced them that, yeah, this is pretty much true and they're trying to take control of us and 1984 is going to be 2004, what can I do or what can they do other than waking other people up to stop this from happening?
[02:27:15.546 --> 02:27:16.487]  It's a big question.
[02:27:16.527 --> 02:27:16.847]  Stay there.
[02:27:16.887 --> 02:27:18.008]  We'll talk about it when we get back.
[02:27:18.069 --> 02:27:20.772]  We'll get into some more news and take some more of your calls.
[02:27:22.000 --> 02:27:24.381]  The toll-free number to join us is 1-800-259-9231.
[02:27:24.401 --> 02:27:24.781]  That's 800-253-3139.
[02:27:24.841 --> 02:27:27.781]  And again, the website is Infowars.com.
[02:27:27.801 --> 02:27:28.241]  Stay with us.
[02:27:28.261 --> 02:27:30.022]  We're on the march.
[02:27:30.042 --> 02:27:31.062]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:31.122 --> 02:27:32.743]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.315 --> 02:27:49.896]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[02:27:49.936 --> 02:27:51.557]  I've tried many, many products.
[02:27:51.697 --> 02:27:53.998]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenate.
[02:27:54.458 --> 02:27:58.300]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than eight weeks.
[02:27:58.700 --> 02:27:59.400]  It truly works.
[02:27:59.775 --> 02:28:00.996]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[02:28:01.356 --> 02:28:07.301]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[02:28:07.401 --> 02:28:13.546]  Vim and Vigor's collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism, and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[02:28:13.886 --> 02:28:17.849]  Our listeners keep telling us Vim and Vigor's collagenate really does work.
[02:28:18.289 --> 02:28:19.330]  It's healthy for you, too.
[02:28:19.690 --> 02:28:27.216]  In addition to helping you lose weight, Collagenate is also designed to improve strength and health of muscles, joints, skin, hair, and nails.
[02:28:27.616 --> 02:28:29.837]  So take Collagenate and rejuvenate.
[02:28:29.897 --> 02:28:30.978]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[02:28:30.998 --> 02:28:31.258]  1-800-622-THIN.
[02:28:31.318 --> 02:28:31.539]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[02:28:31.599 --> 02:28:34.020]  And listen, get $25 off a three-month supply of Collagenate.
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:34.481]  So call now.
[02:28:34.501 --> 02:28:34.721]  1-800-622-THIN.
[02:28:34.741 --> 02:28:34.941]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[02:28:46.309 --> 02:28:53.812]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:28:54.092 --> 02:29:04.996]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:29:05.216 --> 02:29:05.576]  We're good to go.
[02:29:21.756 --> 02:29:22.257]  That's right.
[02:29:22.437 --> 02:29:29.564]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:29:29.844 --> 02:29:38.592]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:38.653 --> 02:29:39.113]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:48.780 --> 02:29:54.284]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:54.704 --> 02:29:58.927]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:59.167 --> 02:30:06.212]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:06.593 --> 02:30:12.717]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:12.837 --> 02:30:14.058]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:14.258 --> 02:30:14.698]  We're good to go.
[02:30:31.164 --> 02:30:34.307]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:30:34.327 --> 02:30:34.427]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.447 --> 02:30:34.547]  866-885-6625.
[02:30:34.667 --> 02:30:35.608]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:30:35.628 --> 02:30:35.849]  Call today.
[02:30:35.869 --> 02:30:40.072]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:30:40.112 --> 02:30:41.794]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:31:00.067 --> 02:31:07.231]  Okay, so Ryan in New Jersey wants to know, you know, what more can I do once I've woken people up?
[02:31:07.331 --> 02:31:18.218]  Well, a lot of times we feel like because we've woken somebody up or they've agreed with us, which is now more and more commonplace, whereas, you know, that was the opposite of just five, six years ago.
[02:31:19.919 --> 02:31:27.343]  You know, we feel like we're awake now, and they feel like they're awake, but then you say, what else do we do other than wake more people up?
[02:31:28.052 --> 02:31:34.496]  A lot of folks feel like they're awake and informed, but they don't go out and actually wake people up, or they sit around and talk to the choir.
[02:31:35.697 --> 02:31:38.698]  And so really it goes back to wake up others.
[02:31:38.839 --> 02:31:43.401]  And don't just wake them up and get them to agree with you at a surface level of what's going on.
[02:31:43.922 --> 02:31:45.202]  Really educate them.
[02:31:45.362 --> 02:31:47.784]  Really get them informed to the full horror of it.
[02:31:49.375 --> 02:31:50.455]  Or the vacation they're planning.
[02:32:17.490 --> 02:32:19.851]  And so, really, it's not the focus in their life.
[02:32:19.891 --> 02:32:29.833]  They see themselves as spectators, not as participants in the world we live in.
[02:32:31.313 --> 02:32:38.574]  And regardless of whether you think you're a spectator or a participant, you really are a participant.
[02:32:39.475 --> 02:32:42.275]  And sitting off on the sidelines is the worst place to be.
[02:32:42.295 --> 02:32:46.496]  I mean, you're actually in incoming, oncoming traffic.
[02:32:47.859 --> 02:32:56.369]  And so most people just kind of have these feelings, and no stuff's wrong, but it never really becomes a central part of their life.
[02:32:57.991 --> 02:33:06.581]  And frankly, my videos are a great way to go, because you've got a two-hour, 44-minute film like Police State, Three Total Enslavement.
[02:33:07.961 --> 02:33:10.682]  And the first 25 minutes is, this is the New World Order.
[02:33:10.722 --> 02:33:12.142]  This is what the New World Order does.
[02:33:12.202 --> 02:33:13.143]  This is their goals.
[02:33:13.523 --> 02:33:15.364]  This is the fake left-right paradigm.
[02:33:15.704 --> 02:33:16.584]  This is the liberals.
[02:33:16.684 --> 02:33:18.044]  This is the neocons.
[02:33:18.485 --> 02:33:19.925]  These are the people they con.
[02:33:20.445 --> 02:33:21.906]  These are the laws they're bringing in.
[02:33:21.966 --> 02:33:34.450]  Patriot Act 1 and 2, Homeland Security, Total Information Awareness Network, the TIPS program, government-run white slavery rings, gun control, foreign troops, RFID tracker chips, implantable chips, concentration camps.
[02:33:35.538 --> 02:33:36.239]  I think we're good to go.
[02:34:06.028 --> 02:34:19.391]  I mean, to use the analogy of a police investigation, we go into the house where the murder's taking place, and there might be 50 pieces of really important evidence, but to an untrained eye, they don't know how to pick it out or see it or get it or collect it and bag it.
[02:34:19.991 --> 02:34:29.373]  So we have bagged just tons of smoking gun evidence, and then we're displaying it like it's a jury in the films.
[02:34:32.034 --> 02:34:47.182]  And our best evidence is admissions, not of people like Paul O'Neill or Richard Clark, who they could claim had an axe to grind about premeditated plans to invade Iraq before 9-11, making up the weapons of mass destruction.
[02:34:48.603 --> 02:34:49.143]  Forget that.
[02:34:49.163 --> 02:34:50.124]  The media focuses on that.
[02:34:50.364 --> 02:34:53.365]  I'm using one small little example of exposing corruption here.
[02:34:53.406 --> 02:34:54.166]  There's millions of them.
[02:34:55.313 --> 02:35:07.738]  What we do is we go, okay, here's PNAC, here's Dick Cheney, wrote this in 2000, saying Saddam isn't a threat, saying it's about oil, saying it's about military bases to take over the world, that it's about a new world order.
[02:35:08.939 --> 02:35:10.979]  Here's Jeff Bush in the same group saying it.
[02:35:10.999 --> 02:35:19.863]  Here's Richard Perle, or here's Wolfowitz, or here's Donald Rumsfeld saying it.
[02:35:19.923 --> 02:35:21.144]  So let's focus on that.
[02:35:21.724 --> 02:35:24.225]  So much of what's in the films and what I do...
[02:35:25.357 --> 02:35:29.121]  I don't say, ooh, there's a secret plan for the government to put microchips in you.
[02:35:30.523 --> 02:35:35.308]  We show that secret plan that's been public now for many years, declassified.
[02:35:35.668 --> 02:35:40.193]  But then we show Andy Rooney saying everybody needs a microchip to tell who the good people are.
[02:35:40.653 --> 02:35:43.076]  We show Sean Hannity saying everybody needs a microchip.
[02:35:43.737 --> 02:35:47.501]  We show the news articles where they're pushing it on school children.
[02:35:48.507 --> 02:35:56.350]  It's not just like I'm putting on a prosecution where I don't have concrete evidence and I'm going, he was at the scene, witnesses saw him, we found this blood.
[02:35:57.271 --> 02:35:59.631]  No, it's we have him confessing on video here.
[02:36:00.092 --> 02:36:03.713]  You know, we... I mean, this is concrete stuff, folks.
[02:36:03.733 --> 02:36:09.015]  This isn't... I mean, sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night laying there in bed and I go, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:36:10.516 --> 02:36:10.696]  I mean...
[02:36:11.897 --> 02:36:18.559]  I'm this guy on the radio, on AM and FM stations dotted across the country, on the Internet, with millions of visitors every month.
[02:36:18.899 --> 02:36:19.959]  What a responsibility.
[02:36:20.459 --> 02:36:27.281]  And I'm just an average guy who sees straight, folks, who knows history and studies and goes off what the elites are doing and what they say.
[02:36:28.761 --> 02:36:34.783]  But, you know, I wake up in the middle of the night and I say, my goodness, man, I've really put myself on the line here.
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:42.905]  And, wow, I mean, these people really are, this criminal, and I'm really going up against them.
[02:36:43.966 --> 02:36:49.611]  And the only reason I'm alive is because I've already put my work into videos and books, so they kill me, it just makes it more popular.
[02:36:50.692 --> 02:36:55.757]  You know, the folks they kill are some government agent who's going to blow the whistle on them and has got some damning piece of evidence.
[02:36:55.777 --> 02:37:03.043]  That person dies in an automobile accident or of a stroke or somebody shoots him twice in the back of the head and the medical examiner rules it's a suicide.
[02:37:04.566 --> 02:37:12.309]  Or the person's tied down and has their guts cut out and strung all over the walls while they're alive to find out what they know, and then it's in the news that just some neighborhood kids did it.
[02:37:12.369 --> 02:37:13.190]  The microbiologists.
[02:37:13.210 --> 02:37:14.650]  Doesn't matter.
[02:37:14.670 --> 02:37:20.052]  A lot of people are having their intestines strung out around the room, but kids are doing it in the neighborhood.
[02:37:20.072 --> 02:37:21.533]  We're going to charge a 15-year-old with it.
[02:37:23.454 --> 02:37:26.335]  So, you know, I think about all this, and I say, man, I've gone up against this.
[02:37:26.475 --> 02:37:33.758]  But, you know, I know the formula that at least protects you to a great degree, and that's asking God for protection.
[02:37:34.557 --> 02:37:44.941]  But, you know, the worldly formula of being in the light, like Jennifer Flowers on Hardball back in 99 going, Bill Clinton's killed a lot of people.
[02:37:45.481 --> 02:37:46.521]  There's a huge death list.
[02:37:46.541 --> 02:37:47.461]  And he goes, you're saying that?
[02:37:47.501 --> 02:37:48.502]  Well, why are you still alive?
[02:37:48.522 --> 02:37:52.243]  And she said, because I'm in the light, buddy, because I'm speaking out, because I wrote a book.
[02:37:53.394 --> 02:37:58.857]  And I cannot stress to you how important that is, because these people operate off of fear.
[02:37:58.897 --> 02:38:00.098]  Their whole paradigm is fear.
[02:38:00.378 --> 02:38:03.920]  Their minions, their servants, their dumbed-down idiots operate out of fear.
[02:38:04.360 --> 02:38:06.001]  The elite operates out of fear.
[02:38:06.041 --> 02:38:09.743]  They've got to be more tyrannical than anybody, or they'll be unseated from the power positions.
[02:38:11.964 --> 02:38:19.528]  And so when they see somebody who's just committed to it and just doesn't have fear, they don't know how to handle that, and they run from it.
[02:38:20.248 --> 02:38:21.609]  They respect it, by the way.
[02:38:22.583 --> 02:38:27.525]  And, you know, every month or so, I'll just wake up in the middle of the night, and I don't even want to call it fear.
[02:38:27.585 --> 02:38:30.726]  It's more of a, you know, my conscious mind shut down.
[02:38:30.786 --> 02:38:47.152]  I'm in the dream state, and I'm having some particularly vivid dream about the New World Order, and I wake up, and, you know, I'm sweating, and I just sit up in bed breathing deep, and I'm just like, they really are kidnapping millions of children.
[02:38:47.993 --> 02:38:48.653]  They really are.
[02:38:49.525 --> 02:38:51.246]  Putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.
[02:38:51.266 --> 02:38:53.427]  They really are putting this stuff in our water.
[02:38:54.608 --> 02:38:56.369]  They really did fund Hitler and Stalin.
[02:38:56.409 --> 02:38:59.131]  They really did put Fidel into power.
[02:38:59.151 --> 02:39:00.912]  They really are behind all this.
[02:39:01.072 --> 02:39:02.273]  This really is real.
[02:39:04.634 --> 02:39:06.015]  I'm really standing against this.
[02:39:06.515 --> 02:39:07.936]  What have I gotten myself into?
[02:39:10.398 --> 02:39:11.979]  But it's not even a fear.
[02:39:12.019 --> 02:39:15.941]  It's more of just a realization.
[02:39:18.734 --> 02:39:25.896]  It's more of just my flesh feeling the burning heat of the New World Order and wanting to go away from it.
[02:39:26.897 --> 02:39:29.317]  But that's really the trick the globalists play on us.
[02:39:29.917 --> 02:39:32.238]  We are saved by laying down our life.
[02:39:32.338 --> 02:39:35.079]  We are delivered by sacrificing.
[02:39:35.559 --> 02:39:42.201]  We are lifted up via our persecution.
[02:39:43.576 --> 02:39:51.743]  And certainly there's been persecution, and I never talk about it, because it's pointless to give the enemy propaganda, to go around doing their barking for them.
[02:39:52.463 --> 02:39:57.027]  But every time I've been persecuted, I just get rewarded, and things get even better, and we reach even more people.
[02:39:58.348 --> 02:40:03.232]  So when you talk about solutions, the solution is with the individual.
[02:40:04.012 --> 02:40:06.855]  The solution is about changing our hearts and minds and souls.
[02:40:07.836 --> 02:40:11.879]  The solution is about committing ourselves.
[02:40:13.401 --> 02:40:13.842]  Totally.
[02:40:15.002 --> 02:40:15.363]  To this.
[02:40:16.764 --> 02:40:19.225]  And there's a great strength that comes out of that.
[02:40:19.325 --> 02:40:21.067]  I mean, we know what we're talking about.
[02:40:21.467 --> 02:40:22.888]  We talk about real things.
[02:40:22.948 --> 02:40:23.909]  We deal with real issues.
[02:40:24.469 --> 02:40:25.930]  And there are quite a few people that do do that.
[02:40:27.691 --> 02:40:34.256]  People like Dr. Dennis Cuddy or Atex Mars or Dr. Monteith or many others.
[02:40:34.276 --> 02:40:41.341]  There are a lot of other quacks and kooks and people that intentionally mix disinfo in with things that can't be proven.
[02:40:42.029 --> 02:40:54.696]  And unfortunately, that's really, you want a solution, that's what's holding us back to the greatest extent, is people that add things on to the already unbelievable stuff that's going on.
[02:40:57.537 --> 02:41:00.899]  And for some it's because it sells books, and for others it's because they think it protects them.
[02:41:02.860 --> 02:41:07.843]  But, I mean, it's weird enough to go, here's Newsday, here's the Associated Press.
[02:41:09.070 --> 02:41:10.391]  160 in the first wave.
[02:41:10.551 --> 02:41:12.612]  There's a plan to make all police in Mexico take it.
[02:41:16.653 --> 02:41:17.814]  Take microchips.
[02:41:17.934 --> 02:41:18.974]  It's on ABC News.
[02:41:18.994 --> 02:41:20.775]  The door is open when you have the microchip.
[02:41:21.596 --> 02:41:24.237]  And then you flip to the next channel, and oh, all children need it.
[02:41:24.317 --> 02:41:26.138]  Oh, Japanese school children may be getting it.
[02:41:26.799 --> 02:41:28.019]  The government wants to make them have it.
[02:41:28.359 --> 02:41:31.021]  They can have an ID card with the chip, or they can have it under the skin.
[02:41:31.041 --> 02:41:32.341]  You know, blah, blah, blah.
[02:41:32.541 --> 02:41:34.582]  That's hard enough for people to believe.
[02:41:34.722 --> 02:41:41.445]  Most people who were preemptively conditioned that this stuff didn't exist 10 years ago, watch out for kooks.
[02:41:41.485 --> 02:41:42.906]  They'll talk about implantable chips.
[02:41:43.266 --> 02:41:44.607]  They'll talk about black helicopters.
[02:41:45.765 --> 02:41:54.953]  You know, the media told us this, and I remember hearing it ten years ago and going, yes, schizophrenics talk about microchips in a plane upon a menace, and black helicopters don't exist, it's a thing of nutcases.
[02:41:56.574 --> 02:42:13.828]  And then suddenly black helicopters ravaged Texas from end to end, and I interviewed police chiefs and got video of burning buildings and foreign groups and mayors and everybody angry, and then I was called, and the newspaper said, yes, the black helicopters attacked, and right next to it my picture saying I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[02:42:14.534 --> 02:42:17.015]  I'm still bad because I said, look, that's not good.
[02:42:17.035 --> 02:42:19.236]  So it's the same thing with the chips.
[02:42:19.276 --> 02:42:35.804]  They preemptively condition us that weirdos talk about it, then they come out and announce it right after 9-11 when we're at this heightened level of fear, when we're kind of in the child mode and the government's the parent, kind of in that psychological space of looking to authority, and then now they're beating the drum and getting ready to make us do it.
[02:42:35.864 --> 02:42:40.486]  The prisoners, the old people, the cops, and then, well, if I have to take it, you better take it.
[02:42:42.049 --> 02:42:45.332]  Or, you know, you get half off if you have the chip at the store, like a loyalty card.
[02:42:45.592 --> 02:42:49.896]  I mean, the corporations say they're going to do this, so we better have a debate about this and discuss this.
[02:42:50.337 --> 02:42:53.760]  So, see, that's weird enough when it's out of the Associated Press.
[02:42:53.900 --> 02:43:05.090]  I don't need to get off into Chupacabras or Yetis or, you know, all this stuff, because I can't prove it.
[02:43:05.250 --> 02:43:06.171]  I can't document it.
[02:43:06.351 --> 02:43:07.352]  I can't demonstrate it.
[02:43:08.926 --> 02:43:12.447]  And so many patriot leaders, alternative leaders, get off into this stuff.
[02:43:12.988 --> 02:43:20.570]  And so I would just challenge people, when you're out there in your daily life, only talk about stuff to your friends and family that you can absolutely prove without a shadow of a doubt.
[02:43:23.051 --> 02:43:24.712]  And stick to the real deal.
[02:43:25.492 --> 02:43:26.632]  And really be informed.
[02:43:26.873 --> 02:43:28.213]  Immerse yourself in this.
[02:43:32.675 --> 02:43:33.455]  We were talking to...
[02:43:34.753 --> 02:43:38.775]  Brian in New Jersey, then we'll go to Daryl, Lewis, David, and a few others.
[02:43:38.835 --> 02:43:41.476]  But real quick, Brian, does that answer your question?
[02:43:41.776 --> 02:43:43.316]  That totally answers my question.
[02:43:43.857 --> 02:43:46.418]  I'd like to do a really, really quick follow-up.
[02:43:46.498 --> 02:43:48.779]  I just watched Police State 3 for like the fourth time.
[02:43:50.479 --> 02:43:58.282]  The part where you're more or less, you know, not screaming at these police officers that have no badge numbers or identification, what can we do about that?
[02:43:58.302 --> 02:43:59.943]  And on that, I'll hang up, and thank you for answering.
[02:44:00.223 --> 02:44:00.843]  Well, thank you.
[02:44:00.863 --> 02:44:02.584]  They were in violation of state law.
[02:44:04.916 --> 02:44:05.617]  And they don't care.
[02:44:05.797 --> 02:44:07.478]  The laws go one way, not the other.
[02:44:10.679 --> 02:44:16.363]  And with the problem of people impersonating police officers and raping women and carjacking people, which does happen.
[02:44:16.743 --> 02:44:19.845]  It's happened right here in Austin the last two years, a whole string of it.
[02:44:20.645 --> 02:44:26.408]  And they said, don't stop if it's a cop until he shows you the badge and stuff.
[02:44:26.648 --> 02:44:29.130]  But then you ask him for a badge, he'll tell you to shut up and put a gun to your head.
[02:44:29.450 --> 02:44:30.150]  And not all of them.
[02:44:30.170 --> 02:44:30.951]  A lot of them are nice.
[02:44:32.594 --> 02:44:33.855]  Well, I've got to be honest about that.
[02:44:33.895 --> 02:44:36.397]  I got caught speeding again on a bunch of other stuff and they let me go.
[02:44:36.778 --> 02:44:37.699]  And don't ask me why.
[02:44:37.719 --> 02:44:39.340]  I mean, I share all this stuff with me.
[02:44:40.421 --> 02:44:42.022]  I seem to do horrible things to people I know.
[02:44:42.083 --> 02:44:44.505]  It's like, when you stand up, you get treated different.
[02:44:44.745 --> 02:44:45.466]  I don't understand it.
[02:44:46.747 --> 02:44:48.468]  And I'm not saying I shouldn't have gotten a speeding ticket.
[02:44:50.610 --> 02:44:52.552]  I didn't say, please don't give me a speeding ticket, too.
[02:44:52.572 --> 02:44:53.152]  I just said, okay.
[02:44:54.293 --> 02:44:54.474]  But...
[02:44:56.670 --> 02:44:58.292]  And that's happened over and over again, by the way.
[02:44:58.832 --> 02:45:00.073]  Some cops listen to this, man.
[02:45:00.093 --> 02:45:01.775]  I'm going to get caught speeding sometime.
[02:45:02.035 --> 02:45:03.496]  They're going to beat me upside the head.
[02:45:03.756 --> 02:45:05.058]  We're not going to do that, boy!
[02:45:05.538 --> 02:45:05.958]  Whatever.
[02:45:05.978 --> 02:45:06.659]  See, I don't care.
[02:45:06.719 --> 02:45:07.340]  That's the difference.
[02:45:08.000 --> 02:45:08.941]  I just don't care.
[02:45:09.862 --> 02:45:12.764]  I mean, I'm not worried about it, folks.
[02:45:12.904 --> 02:45:15.266]  I mean, I've been in pain.
[02:45:16.628 --> 02:45:18.609]  I've had a compound fracture.
[02:45:18.629 --> 02:45:20.691]  I've had my head busted open by a baseball bat.
[02:45:20.731 --> 02:45:23.694]  I've been shot at, and I'm just not worried.
[02:45:24.378 --> 02:45:28.320]  I mean, you know, once you, and of course that stuff all happened when I wasn't fighting the New World Order.
[02:45:29.181 --> 02:45:30.662]  Just being an idiot kid in Dallas.
[02:45:31.282 --> 02:45:34.504]  And so all of us has just got to commit to life and quit worrying about it.
[02:45:34.524 --> 02:45:37.126]  You know, the number one cause of death is your automobile.
[02:45:38.046 --> 02:45:38.987]  But you still get in it.
[02:45:41.888 --> 02:45:42.869]  You still get in it.
[02:45:42.889 --> 02:45:49.513]  I mean, that's the thing that's going to kill you until you're 55 and it's heart attacks and cancer and then cars.
[02:45:50.552 --> 02:45:51.392]  But you still get in it.
[02:45:51.412 --> 02:45:52.493]  You don't even worry about it.
[02:45:52.513 --> 02:45:57.015]  But then you cower, give up all your rights because the terrorists might fly a plane into your building.
[02:45:57.896 --> 02:46:00.797]  I mean, even if these terrorists were real, this really was going on, you know.
[02:46:01.137 --> 02:46:02.438]  It wasn't Al-Ciada.
[02:46:04.659 --> 02:46:05.620]  I mean, what's wrong with us?
[02:46:05.640 --> 02:46:09.802]  Again, I don't want to sit here and preach all day, but you asked the question.
[02:46:09.862 --> 02:46:10.982]  Daryl in Pennsylvania.
[02:46:11.002 --> 02:46:11.763]  Daryl, go ahead.
[02:46:14.404 --> 02:46:15.745]  Well, let's go ahead and go to Daryl.
[02:46:15.765 --> 02:46:16.205]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:46:16.810 --> 02:46:17.571]  Alex, can you hear me?
[02:46:17.731 --> 02:46:17.971]  Yes.
[02:46:18.171 --> 02:46:19.933]  Yeah, Fino from Florida is still listening.
[02:46:19.973 --> 02:46:30.041]  Several months ago, I mailed you in violent copies of Pastor Bill Hughes' two books on the Jesuits, The Secret Terrorist and The Enemy Unmasked, and I do think it would be a good idea if you got him on.
[02:46:30.061 --> 02:46:30.721]  Okay.
[02:46:30.981 --> 02:46:33.443]  Pastor Bill Hughes is not on the run, to the best of my knowledge.
[02:46:33.463 --> 02:46:37.807]  He does travel a lot, but I've talked to him, and as far as I know, he's not on the run.
[02:46:37.887 --> 02:46:40.249]  And you asked why they would overthrow a Catholic monarch.
[02:46:40.329 --> 02:46:45.133]  My goodness, they were thrown out of 83 different countries, city-states,
[02:46:45.774 --> 02:46:52.077]  And cities, and most of them were Catholic monarchs that threw them out because they had so many intrigues and assassinations of Catholic monarchs.
[02:46:52.117 --> 02:47:01.120]  Well, yeah, during the break I thought of how ignorant that was because I know full well that the Jesuits did get thrown out and even had the Pope come after them and stuff.
[02:47:01.380 --> 02:47:10.204]  Well, they assassinated two Popes, Clement XIII and Clement XIV at the minimum, and Pope Clement XIV had abolished their order.
[02:47:10.805 --> 02:47:13.245]  And they poisoned him 14 months afterwards.
[02:47:13.285 --> 02:47:17.246]  They poisoned Pope Clement XIII the day before he was... Well, I'll tell you this.
[02:47:17.306 --> 02:47:23.567]  About three years ago, I watched an hour-long special of, like, the Knights of Malta, and they had this Jesuit guy there speaking.
[02:47:24.027 --> 02:47:28.508]  He was talking about the Illuminati, the New World Order, the Masons, everything.
[02:47:28.548 --> 02:47:31.829]  The Jesuits at Georgetown founded the Foreign Service.
[02:47:31.849 --> 02:47:32.569]  No, I understand that.
[02:47:32.649 --> 02:47:33.269]  I know, I know.
[02:47:33.349 --> 02:47:34.669]  It's pretty... They're tied up.
[02:47:34.929 --> 02:47:37.430]  The three Knights of Malta were the heads of the CIA.
[02:47:37.450 --> 02:47:38.950]  These guys are all over the place.
[02:47:39.415 --> 02:47:44.638]  And, Alex, they may not be the head of the New World Order, but they're certainly a very key player in the New World Order.
[02:47:44.678 --> 02:48:05.448]  And it's kind of interesting, a distinguished 12-man military commission that examined eight conspirators in the assassination of Lincoln came to the conclusion that Roman or Jesuits had their hands all over the murder of Lincoln to the point where in 1867 we severed all diplomatic relations with the Vatican City and they weren't restored until 1984 by...
[02:48:07.419 --> 02:48:08.099]  Ronald Reagan.
[02:48:08.140 --> 02:48:15.903]  So these guys are not small players on the field, and I think Bill Hughes... Well, I never said they were... I never said the... Well, I understand, but I'm just saying they're a major player.
[02:48:16.104 --> 02:48:22.967]  The Roman Catholic Papacy and the Jesuits are a major player, and I think... Do you want to give Stephanie Bill Hughes' phone number?
[02:48:23.507 --> 02:48:23.788]  Sure.
[02:48:24.208 --> 02:48:25.689]  Can you patch me over her?
[02:48:25.709 --> 02:48:26.449]  Yeah, we'll do that.
[02:48:26.489 --> 02:48:27.069]  Thanks, Daryl.
[02:48:28.090 --> 02:48:34.293]  Lewis and David, you'll be up next when we get back, and I'll give out the toll-free number to get my films as well, so stay with us for that.
[02:48:34.373 --> 02:48:36.234]  PrisonPlanet.tv is our new website.
[02:48:46.385 --> 02:48:50.710]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.910 --> 02:48:55.335]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:55.475 --> 02:48:56.717]  There is a chance.
[02:48:57.247 --> 02:48:59.849]  To use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.889 --> 02:49:02.772]  The New World Order can emerge.
[02:49:03.032 --> 02:49:07.256]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:07.316 --> 02:49:14.262]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:14.382 --> 02:49:16.404]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.624 --> 02:49:27.092]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:27.372 --> 02:49:32.736]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Take Three, is for you.

[02:49:47.807 --> 02:49:48.467]  Hello, folks.
[02:49:48.587 --> 02:49:58.510]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use for the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.

[02:51:57.466 --> 02:51:58.267]  Thanks for joining us.

[02:53:33.354 --> 02:53:33.574]  Yes, sir.
[02:53:33.594 --> 02:53:33.915]  Good afternoon.
[02:53:33.955 --> 02:53:40.942]  Have you heard anything about the asteroid that is headed to the east coast, supposedly August or September of this year, that's going to strike the Earth?
[02:53:56.767 --> 02:53:57.827]  And it's an ongoing one.
[02:53:57.847 --> 02:54:08.571]  They claimed it was going to hit three weeks ago and kill everybody, and it turned out that it was not this Australian astronomer, astrophysicist, that somebody just used his name.
[02:54:10.232 --> 02:54:17.194]  But as soon as that hoax is disproven, new ones arise, and it's just one of these big distractions that we hear about.
[02:54:17.214 --> 02:54:20.295]  Okay, well, I'll thank you for that, and I'll let someone else call.
[02:54:20.335 --> 02:54:20.595]  Thank you.
[02:54:21.035 --> 02:54:21.496]  You bet.
[02:54:21.916 --> 02:54:25.477]  Are there government plans to nuke a city and claim it was an asteroid, or...?
[02:54:26.209 --> 02:54:26.349]  Alex?
[02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:26.749]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:54.266 --> 02:54:55.906]  I'll try to make this quick.
[02:54:56.006 --> 02:55:00.667]  Is the Millennium Challenge Corporation connected with Millennium Challenge 2002?
[02:55:01.788 --> 02:55:06.248]  I'm familiar with the name, but refresh my memory.
[02:55:06.949 --> 02:55:13.710]  Millennium Challenge 2002 was a military joint kind of experimental operation.
[02:55:15.010 --> 02:55:16.991]  It's pretty ugly looking.
[02:55:17.431 --> 02:55:19.291]  That was the big naval operation?
[02:55:19.884 --> 02:55:21.665]  It was all kind of field exercise.
[02:55:21.725 --> 02:55:23.105]  I remember saying that.
[02:55:23.225 --> 02:55:26.126]  I'm sorry, I didn't remember it at first.
[02:55:26.286 --> 02:55:28.547]  I don't really know the details.
[02:55:28.727 --> 02:55:36.190]  I know they've had a bunch of different global warfare drills going on at record levels, bigger than the Cold War.
[02:55:36.770 --> 02:55:48.115]  Yeah, I stumbled across this stuff today, and it was like, it's the United States Joint Forces Command, and they had a Millennium Challenge 2002, and it was basically...
[02:55:49.907 --> 02:55:56.031]  A kind of experimental thing, and it seems like, you know, it was pretty much the vamp up for Iraq, and maybe, you know, Iraq's just an extension of that.
[02:55:56.072 --> 02:56:03.477]  But there's also a Millennium Challenge corporation that I guess Bush started in office?
[02:56:03.657 --> 02:56:08.981]  You know, which sounds like total communism to me, but... All right, thanks for the call.
[02:56:10.162 --> 02:56:14.865]  Yeah, I mean, they've had innumerable drills, and I think they have Millennium Challenge every year.
[02:56:14.885 --> 02:56:15.425]  I remember that.
[02:56:15.946 --> 02:56:17.007]  All right, have a good weekend.
[02:56:17.027 --> 02:56:18.808]  See you back tonight, 9 to midnight, back on Monday.
[02:56:30.612 --> 02:56:31.634]  We're good to go.
