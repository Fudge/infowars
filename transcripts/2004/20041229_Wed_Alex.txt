[00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:06.080]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.781]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.502 --> 00:00:09.662]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.243 --> 00:00:11.124]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.844 --> 00:00:12.745]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.405 --> 00:00:17.288]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.589 --> 00:00:21.732]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:21.752 --> 00:00:23.834]  Music
[00:00:35.024 --> 00:00:46.535]  Coming up in about an hour and a half, we're going to have John Perkins, the author of Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[00:00:46.915 --> 00:00:58.466]  He worked for the big central banks all over the world, helping bring down third world countries, feeding on their populations, trying to create...
[00:00:59.816 --> 00:01:07.123]  Famine, trying to generate, collapse, dependency on the world financial order.
[00:01:08.664 --> 00:01:17.532]  Now, Joseph Stiklitz, the chief economist at the World Bank, three years ago, quit.
[00:01:18.954 --> 00:01:23.898]  And then thousands of pages of documents were given to Greg Palast at the BBC,
[00:01:25.774 --> 00:01:32.579]  And we subsequently covered it in detail with Greg Palastine and brought forward some new information on this broadcast.
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:42.266]  And the information in those documents mirrors a book that Mr. Perkins has been quietly writing for decades.
[00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:52.053]  Because of his conscience, and he says that he thought about his children's future in a world run by these people.
[00:01:53.661 --> 00:01:54.701]  Very high level.
[00:01:54.762 --> 00:01:55.742]  He'll be joining us.
[00:01:55.762 --> 00:02:00.444]  A glimpse into the New World Order to the highest levels.
[00:02:01.524 --> 00:02:05.546]  Coming up in an hour and 27 minutes.
[00:02:05.586 --> 00:02:06.606]  You do not want to miss it.
[00:02:07.847 --> 00:02:10.828]  You want to understand how the globalists control the planet.
[00:02:10.848 --> 00:02:13.069]  You want to understand how they're not free market.
[00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:19.572]  How they don't care about you being happy and well fed and certainly don't want you to be free.
[00:02:21.832 --> 00:02:26.796]  So that's coming up in, again, a little less than an hour and a half.
[00:02:28.478 --> 00:02:29.939]  So much news today.
[00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.101]  So much news I didn't get to yesterday.
[00:02:32.121 --> 00:02:36.345]  And I'm going to endeavor to cover all the news of today.
[00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:40.969]  And then some of the news that was very important that I noticed I didn't cover in detail.
[00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:41.850]  I didn't mention it.
[00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.951]  Yesterday...
[00:02:44.813 --> 00:02:59.916]  The websites of your online are Infowars.com, that's short for Information War, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and yes, Infowars.net.
[00:03:01.516 --> 00:03:08.317]  Swedish paper reports tsunami warning halted out of concern for tourist industry.
[00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:13.798]  An Australian newspaper is reporting the same thing.
[00:03:14.756 --> 00:03:22.243]  And of course Al Jazeera is, and the neocons are already saying, how dare the foreigners, they just hate America.
[00:03:23.084 --> 00:03:35.236]  Well, they got it from CNN and Fox News and the Associated Press, and they got it from the USGS, the federal government.
[00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:57.926]  Hours before the quake, they were about to put out a warning, but didn't, and then they had over an hour from the time the quake took place to give the populations a warning, and they did have the early warning system in place, and they could have told the media, which they normally do if they think there's going to be a small earthquake.
[00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:04.553]  But the message didn't get there, and now, again, yesterday they said 40 to 100,000.
[00:04:04.713 --> 00:04:07.876]  Now it's 65 to 100,000.
[00:04:08.656 --> 00:04:11.639]  So the number is rising.
[00:04:11.719 --> 00:04:14.762]  At least 60 plus thousand dead.
[00:04:16.383 --> 00:04:22.989]  Swedish paper reports tsunami warning halted out of concern for the tourist industry.
[00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:26.572]  Do you really believe that?
[00:04:27.657 --> 00:04:34.323]  And this adds some credence to people that think that this was some type of government operation.
[00:04:34.383 --> 00:04:40.788]  And Secretary of Defense Cohen, back in 97, said we can create earthquakes and so can other governments.
[00:04:41.188 --> 00:04:42.790]  This will be the weapon of the future.
[00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:44.191]  I mean, that's been in the news.
[00:04:47.534 --> 00:04:52.638]  So it's interesting, but I'm not going to go there because it really is a conspiracy theory.
[00:04:52.678 --> 00:04:54.600]  And we just stick to the stuff we know.
[00:04:55.436 --> 00:04:57.499]  And our government knew and didn't warn anybody.
[00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.860]  I wonder why.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:59.601]  We'll tell you why.
[00:04:59.621 --> 00:05:05.267]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:05:05.448 --> 00:05:09.873]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:05:10.033 --> 00:05:14.418]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:05:14.438 --> 00:05:15.800]  The New World Order.
[00:05:17.581 --> 00:05:21.804]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:05:21.864 --> 00:05:28.789]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:30.931]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:41.737]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:47.300]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:51.703]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:05:51.723 --> 00:05:52.163]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:05:52.183 --> 00:05:54.004]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.250]  Terrorism.
[00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.151]  Terrorism.
[00:06:02.251 --> 00:06:03.111]  Chemical attacks.
[00:06:03.151 --> 00:06:03.831]  Dirty bombs.
[00:06:03.911 --> 00:06:04.332]  Fallout.
[00:06:04.412 --> 00:06:05.412]  Biological attack.
[00:06:05.592 --> 00:06:06.132]  And threats.
[00:06:06.192 --> 00:06:08.313]  And to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[00:06:08.573 --> 00:06:10.174]  Alarming words for our time.
[00:06:10.394 --> 00:06:12.895]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[00:06:13.275 --> 00:06:27.841]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[00:06:27.881 --> 00:06:28.201]  government.
[00:06:28.381 --> 00:06:30.182]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[00:06:30.542 --> 00:06:36.464]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[00:06:36.605 --> 00:06:41.106]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[00:06:41.346 --> 00:06:48.069]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:50.770]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[00:07:02.091 --> 00:07:07.576]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:07:07.997 --> 00:07:12.241]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:07:12.461 --> 00:07:19.508]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:07:19.888 --> 00:07:25.994]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:07:26.134 --> 00:07:27.355]  There are no side effects.
[00:07:27.535 --> 00:07:29.878]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:07:44.455 --> 00:07:47.558]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:07:47.578 --> 00:07:47.618]  866-885-6625.
[00:07:47.638 --> 00:07:47.939]  866-885-6625.
[00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:48.899]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.140]  Call today.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.681]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[00:07:50.701 --> 00:07:52.423]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:14.361]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:08:14.401 --> 00:08:15.981]  until 2 p.m.
[00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:17.121]  Central Standard Time.
[00:08:17.161 --> 00:08:19.242]  We're here back from 9 to midnight.
[00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:22.563]  Again, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:08:23.963 --> 00:08:33.605]  And for those night owls out there, my broadcast is retransmitted from midnight until 6 a.m.
[00:08:33.745 --> 00:08:34.405]  Back to back.
[00:08:34.926 --> 00:08:35.846]  So really, from 9 p.m.
[00:08:35.906 --> 00:08:36.126]  until 6 a.m.,
[00:08:41.796 --> 00:08:48.178]  That's nine hours of the Alex Jones Show, because stations out there have requested those refeeds.
[00:08:48.838 --> 00:08:57.981]  That is there for you, available on some AM and FM stations out there, and of course on the internet at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:08:58.001 --> 00:08:58.901]  You can always listen there.
[00:08:58.921 --> 00:09:04.183]  And during the nine hours at night, and of course the three live hours during the day from 11 to 2 Central,
[00:09:06.463 --> 00:09:15.415]  And global shortwave during the day from 11 to 2 Central on the Big Blow Torch, WWCR at 9.985, and at night from 9 to midnight at 3210, or on your satellite dishes.
[00:09:15.455 --> 00:09:15.535]  Okay.
[00:09:23.587 --> 00:09:32.273]  Coming up in an hour and 15 minutes, we've got John Perkins' Confessions of an Economic Hitman inside the international banking cartels.
[00:09:32.653 --> 00:09:33.573]  He's gone public.
[00:09:33.633 --> 00:09:37.516]  The former chief economist of the World Bank, Joseph Shiklitz, has gone public.
[00:09:38.236 --> 00:09:43.259]  And we're going to be talking to Mr. Perkins coming up again in the middle of the next hour.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.141]  You do not want to miss that.
[00:09:46.061 --> 00:09:47.642]  I don't want to spend all day on this.
[00:09:48.283 --> 00:09:51.805]  It's a horrible tragedy, and my heart goes out to all those that have died.
[00:09:53.118 --> 00:09:56.281]  Yesterday it was 43,000 to 100,000 dead.
[00:09:57.221 --> 00:10:01.004]  They confirmed 43,000 dead, and they said it could go as high as 100,000.
[00:10:02.145 --> 00:10:13.954]  Well, today, depending on what report you look at, it's 60,000 to 65,000 dead bodies that have been found in the four or five countries that were hit.
[00:10:14.375 --> 00:10:18.438]  Sri Lanka being hit the hardest, where most of the deaths occurred.
[00:10:19.719 --> 00:10:28.907]  And they're sure to find more bodies, and it could reach 100,000 dead, but confirmed over 60,000 dead.
[00:10:30.548 --> 00:10:39.295]  Now, the wrinkle in this story is something that was pointed out immediately after this happened last week.
[00:10:41.737 --> 00:10:43.058]  It was on CNN.
[00:10:43.239 --> 00:10:44.680]  It was in the newspaper.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:45.901]  It was all over the place.
[00:10:45.941 --> 00:10:46.521]  The U.S.
[00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:48.263]  Geological Survey
[00:10:49.201 --> 00:10:52.303]  That has seismographs all over the world.
[00:10:54.985 --> 00:10:55.946]  The most prolific.
[00:10:56.646 --> 00:11:00.689]  And the Navy's got their own system, and the Air Force has got their own system.
[00:11:00.929 --> 00:11:01.850]  This stuff is everywhere.
[00:11:03.291 --> 00:11:12.758]  Reported, oh yes, hours before we knew it was going to happen, and then, yes, we had about an hour after the earthquake to warn people, but there just wasn't a warning system, so we couldn't.
[00:11:15.262 --> 00:11:16.702]  There isn't a warning system.
[00:11:16.762 --> 00:11:17.143]  Oh, yeah.
[00:11:17.603 --> 00:11:23.545]  If you call up the media and say, there was just a 9.0 earthquake, 9-point mega-earthquake.
[00:11:24.005 --> 00:11:27.826]  By the way, it changed the rotation of the Earth for a minute or so.
[00:11:28.486 --> 00:11:31.227]  Actually made the Earth wobble, and that's confirmed.
[00:11:31.467 --> 00:11:38.449]  USGS and the French and the Germans and the British and the Russians and the Japanese are all saying they got the same readings.
[00:11:43.051 --> 00:11:44.331]  If they would have called the media...
[00:11:48.251 --> 00:11:50.873]  And told them that would have been the early warning system.
[00:11:52.935 --> 00:11:54.636]  It was daytime over there when all this happened.
[00:11:54.656 --> 00:11:58.299]  People were out there swimming and playing and boating and everything else.
[00:12:00.181 --> 00:12:01.262]  But no warning.
[00:12:03.684 --> 00:12:04.925]  No warning at all.
[00:12:05.025 --> 00:12:16.134]  I mean, folks, they tell us on the news within a minute here in Texas when a tornado forms with their special radar systems.
[00:12:17.018 --> 00:12:19.099]  Our local news can instantly tell us.
[00:12:19.119 --> 00:12:21.761]  We don't need the feds to come swooping in to tell us.
[00:12:22.041 --> 00:12:28.204]  But you notice with the system that the federal government controls that no one gets a warning.
[00:12:28.864 --> 00:12:31.426]  And now we're getting reports of why this happened.
[00:12:31.706 --> 00:12:32.306]  Why they didn't.
[00:12:32.726 --> 00:12:37.009]  Their official story is basically to keep mum on the subject.
[00:12:38.990 --> 00:12:43.292]  I heard neocons last night and this morning going, How dare the foreigners...
[00:12:44.733 --> 00:12:51.614]  How dare Al Jazeera, those Arabs, how dare them report that we knew and didn't warn them?
[00:12:51.634 --> 00:12:55.695]  These guys will jump on anything, those dirty Arabs.
[00:12:57.415 --> 00:13:07.537]  I don't hear them saying, dirty CNN, dirty AP, dirty Fox, dirty Swiss papers, dirty German papers.
[00:13:08.277 --> 00:13:08.498]  No.
[00:13:10.078 --> 00:13:10.798]  They don't do that.
[00:13:11.664 --> 00:13:15.607]  It's just the Arabs have put out this lie.
[00:13:16.788 --> 00:13:20.030]  And you believe they're so low.
[00:13:22.052 --> 00:13:27.016]  Well, if you track the source of the story, it's still on the USGS website.
[00:13:28.417 --> 00:13:31.239]  It's in the Google cache as well, and they try to take it down.
[00:13:32.381 --> 00:13:33.422]  It was all over the news.
[00:13:33.462 --> 00:13:34.202]  You all heard it.
[00:13:34.703 --> 00:13:35.763]  That's where it came from.
[00:13:36.003 --> 00:13:36.584]  I love it.
[00:13:37.144 --> 00:13:37.564]  I love it.
[00:13:37.744 --> 00:13:40.526]  The media, our own media, reports it.
[00:13:40.926 --> 00:13:43.288]  And then if it becomes unpopular, oh, it was the Arabs.
[00:13:45.289 --> 00:13:47.190]  Al Jazeera reported it.
[00:13:49.492 --> 00:13:53.955]  And sure enough, I mean, yes, Al Jazeera is one of thousands of publications that reported it.
[00:13:53.995 --> 00:13:54.775]  Yes, how evil.
[00:13:55.216 --> 00:13:55.696]  The U.S.
[00:13:55.716 --> 00:13:56.837]  knew about the tsunami.
[00:13:57.777 --> 00:13:58.978]  This is from Al Jazeera.
[00:14:00.333 --> 00:14:08.680]  International Ocean Monitors predicted that a tsunami would likely follow the deadly earthquake that hit the Indian Ocean on Sunday.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:11.963]  So I need to be technical.
[00:14:12.003 --> 00:14:13.224]  That was early this week.
[00:14:13.744 --> 00:14:16.687]  But they didn't know who to inform.
[00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:27.656]  We put out a bulletin within 20 minutes, technically, as fast as we could do it, said Jeff Leduce, an official in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
[00:14:30.313 --> 00:14:35.375]  And again, the other federal agencies have said the same thing.
[00:14:36.595 --> 00:14:48.380]  The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center is an international system of monitoring stations, stations in Hawaii that monitors the Pacific and warns nearby countries of any expected disasters.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:56.143]  But the problem with Sunday's deadly earthquake is that the Indian Ocean isn't guarded by the system.
[00:14:57.848 --> 00:15:02.313]  So, actually, Al Jazeera is putting out one of the fairer reports.
[00:15:03.495 --> 00:15:12.885]  If you read what the Swiss are saying, Swedish paper reports tsunami warning halted out of concern for tourist industry.
[00:15:12.905 --> 00:15:15.909]  The Swedish paper Expressen...
[00:15:18.487 --> 00:15:26.835]  Just minutes after the earthquake in the Indian Ocean on Sunday morning, Thailand's foremost meteorological experts were sitting together in a crisis meeting, but they decided not to warn.
[00:15:27.376 --> 00:15:32.621]  So, see, this is Thailand doing it.
[00:15:33.322 --> 00:15:42.411]  But they decided not to warn about the tsunami out of courtesy to the tourist industry, writes the Thailand Daily newspaper, The Nation.
[00:15:43.283 --> 00:15:45.243]  The experts got the news about 8 a.m.
[00:15:45.303 --> 00:15:46.644]  on Sunday morning local time.
[00:15:46.684 --> 00:15:49.344]  An hour later, the first massive wave struck.
[00:15:49.585 --> 00:15:56.946]  But the experts started to discuss the economic impact when they discussed if a tsunami warning should be issued.
[00:15:58.887 --> 00:15:59.967]  So let's get this straight.
[00:16:00.647 --> 00:16:06.448]  We have this international body out there that didn't warn the media but put out a little alert.
[00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:12.750]  We have the Thailand government that actually decided not to put out an alert
[00:16:13.593 --> 00:16:26.527]  When they knew that there was a good chance this was going to happen, we have our government not putting out an alert until it was too late and not contacting the media.
[00:16:26.927 --> 00:16:27.188]  Why?
[00:16:27.348 --> 00:16:28.069]  Why would they do this?
[00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:33.014]  Folks, I don't even follow earthquakes and volcanoes closely.
[00:16:33.650 --> 00:16:42.095]  But all the time I see warnings of this volcano to blow up, to erupt, or chances of earthquakes being higher.
[00:16:42.115 --> 00:16:43.996]  I mean, this is always followed.
[00:16:44.016 --> 00:16:46.858]  This is always put on the news in short order.
[00:16:47.238 --> 00:16:48.879]  Why this time wasn't it?
[00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:53.902]  Maybe it's just all a big accident.
[00:16:55.623 --> 00:16:56.444]  I'm sure that's it.
[00:16:59.139 --> 00:17:15.545]  Regardless of what caused it, whether it's the sun's unusually high activity, ejecting more heat and radiation of the earth that has been causing all sorts of problems with satellites and communication from AM-FM shortwave transmissions,
[00:17:17.373 --> 00:17:33.703]  Whether it is a government super weapon, which I wouldn't even mention that if Secretary of Defense Cohen hadn't said in 97 that, yes, our government has this and other governments have it, and wars of the future will be earthquake wars, volcano wars, to paraphrase him.
[00:17:36.865 --> 00:17:38.786]  But then you've got to ask, why didn't they warn people?
[00:17:39.126 --> 00:17:40.087]  Well, let's just say...
[00:17:41.258 --> 00:17:42.659]  Stick with the facts of what we know.
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:45.222]  But let's just say it was naturally occurring.
[00:17:45.522 --> 00:17:46.183]  Probably was.
[00:17:46.983 --> 00:17:50.967]  Big earthquakes happen in that area frequently, and big tsunamis throughout history.
[00:17:51.207 --> 00:17:52.668]  So let's say it wasn't the government.
[00:17:55.511 --> 00:17:58.654]  Even though the government says they can do things like this.
[00:17:59.434 --> 00:18:03.738]  Guaranteed with nuclear weapons, and probably with some of the other systems they have.
[00:18:04.299 --> 00:18:05.540]  That's all classified, though.
[00:18:08.875 --> 00:18:13.537]  Why then, if it was naturally occurring, wouldn't our government or these other governments warn anybody?
[00:18:15.497 --> 00:18:28.702]  Well, one big reason is the IMF and World Bank and others love big disasters because they get to come in and give loans that are backed up with our tax money that are designed never to be paid back so they get to buy up and control these nations.
[00:18:33.799 --> 00:18:49.283]  We always hear how good our government is when they go in and blow some third world country to kingdom come with smart bombs, blow up the entire, decimate, annihilate the entire infrastructure, and then, oh, we're the only country that goes in and rebuilds after we destroy.
[00:18:49.583 --> 00:18:49.944]  Oh, really?
[00:18:49.964 --> 00:18:51.004]  The Romans did that.
[00:18:51.264 --> 00:18:52.164]  The Greeks did that.
[00:18:52.444 --> 00:18:53.585]  The Persians did that.
[00:18:54.305 --> 00:18:55.645]  The British Empire did that.
[00:18:56.125 --> 00:18:57.206]  Every empire does that.
[00:18:57.246 --> 00:18:58.406]  You go take over the enemy.
[00:18:59.119 --> 00:19:02.942]  Take control of the society and then rebuild the infrastructure because now it's yours.
[00:19:03.302 --> 00:19:06.244]  And they take our money, give it to private corporations.
[00:19:06.665 --> 00:19:07.765]  It's not free market.
[00:19:08.146 --> 00:19:11.148]  They go to these countries, put the people into debt slavery.
[00:19:13.863 --> 00:19:15.425]  So we know they do this with warfare.
[00:19:15.665 --> 00:19:32.923]  And Joseph Stiklitz went public a few years ago, Chief Economist, World Bank, 2,000 pages plus of documents got released, and there it detailed how to create famines, how to destroy economies, how to put in secret police, how to break down societies, how to use disasters.
[00:19:33.304 --> 00:19:35.366]  So that's not speculation.
[00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:42.262]  All right, there is so much other news here, folks.
[00:19:42.783 --> 00:19:45.725]  Dollar hits all-time low against the Euro yesterday.
[00:19:45.745 --> 00:19:48.187]  In the war on terrorism, U.S.
[00:19:48.208 --> 00:19:50.410]  draft shots to be on the guard.
[00:19:50.770 --> 00:19:51.891]  Wait till you hear this article.
[00:19:52.912 --> 00:19:54.553]  There is just so much coming up.
[00:19:55.014 --> 00:19:57.036]  News blitz straight ahead, and then your phone calls.
[00:19:57.556 --> 00:19:59.458]  We'll be right back, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:20:02.781 --> 00:20:04.903]  Those dark, depressing days are here.
[00:20:05.592 --> 00:20:09.082]  Are you among the 15% of North Americans who suffer from the winter blues?
[00:20:09.683 --> 00:20:13.193]  This condition is simply caused by the lack of sunlight during the short winter days
[00:20:13.877 --> 00:20:16.438]  Do you suffer from constant fatigue and lack of energy?
[00:20:16.458 --> 00:20:19.320]  Do you have a hard time pulling yourself out of bed in the morning?
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:21.261]  Do you put on weight in the winter?
[00:20:21.961 --> 00:20:23.682]  Is your life on hold till the spring?
[00:20:24.222 --> 00:20:25.183]  Check with your doctor.
[00:20:25.283 --> 00:20:30.205]  You may be suffering from the winter blues or from SAD, Seasonal Affective Disorder.
[00:20:30.665 --> 00:20:35.388]  In all likelihood, your doctor will recommend bright light therapy with one of our special lights.
[00:20:36.028 --> 00:20:36.869]  Light up your life.
[00:20:36.969 --> 00:20:39.690]  Put some sunshine on your depressing days with the northern lights.
[00:20:40.222 --> 00:20:40.743]  We're good to go.
[00:21:00.785 --> 00:21:01.785]  Hello, Ted Anderson.
[00:21:01.866 --> 00:21:06.648]  Listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and understand the risks of deficit spending.
[00:21:06.808 --> 00:21:14.611]  Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from their accounts.
[00:21:14.871 --> 00:21:20.234]  A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in reserve for immediate withdrawal.
[00:21:20.454 --> 00:21:27.437]  Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government is forced to insure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy.
[00:21:27.817 --> 00:21:28.337]  We're good to go.
[00:21:28.397 --> 00:21:28.538]  I think?
[00:21:52.891 --> 00:21:54.572]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:55.833 --> 00:21:59.034]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:21:59.995 --> 00:22:03.036]  You and your family members getting enough minerals in the daily diet?
[00:22:03.416 --> 00:22:05.918]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[00:22:06.138 --> 00:22:13.241]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:22:13.401 --> 00:22:16.683]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[00:22:16.943 --> 00:22:18.924]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:22:19.264 --> 00:22:19.905]  We're good to go.
[00:22:35.247 --> 00:22:35.967]  Or visit Seaminerals.com.
[00:23:00.726 --> 00:23:05.208]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[00:23:05.568 --> 00:23:09.669]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[00:23:09.949 --> 00:23:10.490]  We listened.
[00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:15.772]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[00:23:16.052 --> 00:23:16.532]  We listened.
[00:23:16.932 --> 00:23:19.973]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[00:23:20.393 --> 00:23:20.934]  We listened.
[00:23:21.394 --> 00:23:24.535]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during
[00:23:24.795 --> 00:23:25.355]  We're good to go.
[00:23:50.109 --> 00:23:55.294]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:23:55.374 --> 00:24:02.540]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:26.522 --> 00:24:27.763]  Welcome back, my friends.
[00:24:28.803 --> 00:24:30.724]  Let's plunge straight into the news.
[00:24:30.944 --> 00:24:35.907]  Dollar hits an all-time low against the Euro currency.
[00:24:35.927 --> 00:24:37.308]  The U.S.
[00:24:37.508 --> 00:24:45.672]  dollar slid to a new all-time low yesterday against the Euro, which rose to 136.43 in the thin post-holiday trading.
[00:24:50.419 --> 00:24:58.943]  This latest fall came in afternoon European trading, with the Euro creeping just past its previous high set on Monday.
[00:24:59.703 --> 00:25:01.104]  So it's a new high every day.
[00:25:01.124 --> 00:25:03.324]  New high yesterday.
[00:25:04.085 --> 00:25:04.445]  The U.S.
[00:25:04.485 --> 00:25:11.988]  currency has hit a series of new lows against the Euro since Thursday in very light trading around the Christmas holiday.
[00:25:12.448 --> 00:25:16.330]  Low trading volumes can make exchange rates more volatile, said...
[00:25:17.125 --> 00:25:21.348]  Josime Schultz, chief economist for UBS in Zurich.
[00:25:21.728 --> 00:25:25.010]  There is a very strong consensus the dollar has further to fall.
[00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:36.717]  He said in Tokyo yesterday the dollar bought 103.6 down 0.68 from its level late on Monday.
[00:25:39.439 --> 00:25:41.020]  Very bad for our economy.
[00:25:42.313 --> 00:25:51.378]  But again, years ago, the Davos Economic World Forum, they said, what, four years ago, we're going to turn the lights off in America and turn the lights on in Europe.
[00:25:53.799 --> 00:25:58.962]  And there's some media argument that, oh, well, this will actually strengthen America and hurt the European Union.
[00:25:59.462 --> 00:26:03.204]  Bottom line, it hurts the people of the EU and America.
[00:26:03.724 --> 00:26:06.185]  It helps the globalists who are consolidating wealth.
[00:26:07.926 --> 00:26:09.007]  And that's the bottom line.
[00:26:09.467 --> 00:26:11.188]  Talking about police state...
[00:26:12.307 --> 00:26:14.689]  This is out of Knight Ritter newspapers.
[00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:18.192]  In War on Terrorism, U.S.
[00:26:18.352 --> 00:26:21.114]  drafts shops to be on guard.
[00:26:22.415 --> 00:26:25.618]  Now again, the average person has no idea this is even going on.
[00:26:26.759 --> 00:26:39.029]  It may surprise some people to learn that one of the linchpins in the nation's War on Terrorism is the Ben and Beryl Mini Mart in Fairmont, California.
[00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:48.063]  Manager Sonia Chima certainly was when her dad bought the store in October.
[00:26:49.165 --> 00:27:02.496]  Under federal rule, still being fine-tuned, that is selectively enforced, she discovered the bed and barrel, like thousands of other businesses, must have a written plan for foiling money laundering tariffs.
[00:27:02.616 --> 00:27:03.917]  It's indentured servitude.
[00:27:03.977 --> 00:27:05.799]  You have to carry out the Fed's work for them.
[00:27:06.159 --> 00:27:10.983]  It also must have a compliance officer to ensure the plan is heeded.
[00:27:11.583 --> 00:27:17.445]  Train its employees to spot shady transactions and regularly audit its own performance.
[00:27:17.905 --> 00:27:18.886]  But that's not all.
[00:27:19.926 --> 00:27:23.427]  While not widely known, the Ben and Beryl and every other U.S.
[00:27:23.507 --> 00:27:26.348]  business, every other U.S.
[00:27:26.408 --> 00:27:38.633]  business, must feel clear of people on the government's 192-page list of specifically designated nationals.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:46.283]  And again, you don't know they come by from you, which has more than 5,000 names and is updated frequently.
[00:27:47.124 --> 00:27:53.067]  Otherwise, business people could face huge fines and long stays in prison.
[00:27:54.908 --> 00:27:59.550]  Again, folks, all of these new laws have been passing.
[00:28:00.131 --> 00:28:04.393]  Previously, banks were pretty much the only businesses that had to worry about money launders.
[00:28:05.093 --> 00:28:07.235]  But that changed after the terror attacks of 9-11.
[00:28:08.664 --> 00:28:23.455]  On September 24, 2001, President Bush signed an executive order barring businesses' dealings with anyone on the specifically designated list, which includes the names and aliases of suspected terrorists, drug kingpins, and their associates.
[00:28:23.936 --> 00:28:29.780]  Those failing to comply can be fined $10 million and jailed up to 10 years in prison.
[00:28:31.508 --> 00:28:44.117]  That was followed a month later by enactment of the USA Patriot Act, which forces financial institutions, broadly defined, to include everything from liquor stores to pawn shops to have detailed programs for combating money launderers.
[00:28:44.557 --> 00:28:51.822]  Under the enforcement provisions, business operators face potential fines of half a million dollars and a ten-year prison term.
[00:28:52.805 --> 00:29:03.328]  The Patriot Act, already in effect for casinos, mutual funds, credit card firms, banks and money service businesses, like the Ben and Beryl, which offer such things as check cashing and money transfers.
[00:29:04.248 --> 00:29:16.031]  Still others, jewelers, vehicle dealers, travel agents, loan companies, investment firms, and people involved in real estate closings are waiting for the government to issue their regulations under the Act.
[00:29:16.871 --> 00:29:20.432]  As word about the law spreads, many business people don't like what they're hearing.
[00:29:22.481 --> 00:29:27.065]  And I've got articles here out of England where spitting on the sidewalk is prison time.
[00:29:27.785 --> 00:29:29.046]  Dropping a bubble gum wrapper.
[00:29:31.128 --> 00:29:34.070]  People open their car door, a wrapper blows away, they're arrested.
[00:29:35.491 --> 00:29:38.633]  It's all about netting as many of us as they can in their system.
[00:29:39.074 --> 00:29:40.014]  It's predatory.
[00:29:41.936 --> 00:29:43.577]  It gets worse, though, when we get back.
[00:29:43.657 --> 00:29:45.158]  Now, I told you about this years ago.
[00:29:45.919 --> 00:29:47.300]  Now it's hit the mainstream.
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:49.922]  They're letting you know what slaves we are.
[00:29:51.497 --> 00:29:52.398]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.899 --> 00:29:54.501]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.423 --> 00:29:58.106]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:02.344 --> 00:30:04.286]  SuperSilver's combination of supercharged silver and oxygen
[00:30:22.325 --> 00:30:37.952]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[00:30:38.272 --> 00:30:44.575]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.
[00:30:44.815 --> 00:30:45.916]  That's 1-800-974-1879 or visit supersilver.net.
[00:31:01.044 --> 00:31:07.289]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[00:31:07.429 --> 00:31:13.594]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[00:31:13.874 --> 00:31:22.301]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[00:31:22.561 --> 00:31:29.567]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[00:31:29.867 --> 00:31:30.528]  We're good to go.
[00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:09.034]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its Bubble Up technology, but have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses Bubble Up technology?
[00:32:09.254 --> 00:32:16.197]  BioOx Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[00:32:16.597 --> 00:32:23.246]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds, your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[00:32:23.546 --> 00:32:26.971]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioOx citrus concentrate.
[00:32:26.991 --> 00:32:27.812]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:39.281]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason BioOx International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[00:32:39.341 --> 00:32:46.045]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use BioOx Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[00:32:46.245 --> 00:32:50.928]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[00:32:51.108 --> 00:32:53.649]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[00:32:53.809 --> 00:32:58.452]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use the BioOx family of products.
[00:33:06.087 --> 00:33:07.989]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:08.449 --> 00:33:11.271]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:15.175 --> 00:33:17.296]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:17.396 --> 00:33:19.959]  Crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[00:33:20.639 --> 00:33:21.820]  Real talk radio.
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:25.443]  Real issues of significance that actually affect you and your family.
[00:33:26.384 --> 00:33:34.811]  Confessions of an economic hitman with John Perkins who worked at the highest levels of international banking cartel coming up in the middle of the next hour.
[00:33:36.115 --> 00:33:37.135]  You do not want to miss it.
[00:33:38.095 --> 00:33:42.096]  We're going to go to Mark and Tim and Jason and many others that are holding here in a few minutes.
[00:33:42.516 --> 00:33:48.138]  Toll-free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:49.338 --> 00:33:54.759]  Before I get back into this Knight Rider News Service story, in War on Terrorism, U.S.
[00:33:55.119 --> 00:33:59.120]  drafts shops to be on guard by Steve Johnson.
[00:33:59.180 --> 00:34:01.021]  Good job, Steve Johnson, because you're right.
[00:34:01.081 --> 00:34:02.101]  That's drafting.
[00:34:03.317 --> 00:34:12.303]  Making you collect taxes, making you spy on people without paying you, and without your consent is slavery.
[00:34:13.003 --> 00:34:18.667]  The Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence all speak against it.
[00:34:20.028 --> 00:34:20.708]  Bar it.
[00:34:21.489 --> 00:34:22.910]  Folks, that's tyranny.
[00:34:23.450 --> 00:34:30.835]  I don't care how fancy the headdresses are, the crowns and badges and insignia of our rulers.
[00:34:33.999 --> 00:34:42.443]  Since the old corrupt chiefs of old and the witch doctors with their headdresses were always fooled by the insignias of power.
[00:34:42.863 --> 00:34:44.244]  We're having our freedoms taken.
[00:34:46.545 --> 00:34:47.966]  And this feeds on everybody.
[00:34:48.126 --> 00:35:00.912]  I mean, I've got a stack of articles today from the London Guardian and the Associated Press and Knight Ritter newspaper and USA Today where they're just announcing, oh, guess what?
[00:35:02.795 --> 00:35:05.778]  You commit a misdemeanor that's not even terror-related.
[00:35:05.838 --> 00:35:06.718]  It's considered terror.
[00:35:06.738 --> 00:35:07.939]  You're going to be going to prison.
[00:35:09.521 --> 00:35:12.543]  And every day I see articles where people are going to prison.
[00:35:14.905 --> 00:35:19.208]  People are even getting weeks and months in jail for not wearing seatbelts.
[00:35:19.749 --> 00:35:24.072]  Now, it's just everything is about maximizing the jail time.
[00:35:24.592 --> 00:35:28.395]  If they can't get you in the psychiatric system, they'll get you into the criminal justice system.
[00:35:29.536 --> 00:35:30.457]  If they can't do that...
[00:35:32.597 --> 00:35:34.398]  They will try to get you on welfare.
[00:35:34.578 --> 00:35:36.760]  It's all about dependency.
[00:35:37.601 --> 00:35:41.844]  And we have the World Bank and IMF documents on this.
[00:35:41.884 --> 00:35:43.165]  We've always known it.
[00:35:44.105 --> 00:35:45.506]  But more and more of this is public.
[00:35:45.847 --> 00:35:50.070]  They set our government's policies, whether it's Sri Lanka or the United States.
[00:35:53.192 --> 00:35:55.774]  They go in and tell the governments how to operate.
[00:35:55.954 --> 00:35:57.575]  They follow international treaties.
[00:35:57.795 --> 00:35:58.676]  You know UNESCO...
[00:35:59.952 --> 00:36:08.976]  The United Nations Educational and Cultural Organization that Ronald Reagan pulled us out of, that George Bush signed back onto, that Bill Clinton wouldn't dare to try to push.
[00:36:12.438 --> 00:36:22.443]  It's all UN treaty, how to run our schools, how to have the new freedom initiative, the new freedom to forcibly psychologically test every child in America twice a year, even if you're private or homeschooled.
[00:36:22.683 --> 00:36:24.104]  I mean, think about growing up
[00:36:24.858 --> 00:36:28.700]  Reading about Russia, where they grab you and psychologically test you if they didn't like you.
[00:36:29.161 --> 00:36:30.762]  Well, in America, we go further.
[00:36:33.323 --> 00:36:35.344]  Oh, it's your freedom, whether you like it or not.
[00:36:35.625 --> 00:36:38.186]  It's your new freedom to be a slave.
[00:36:40.327 --> 00:36:49.513]  And don't think that they don't know what they're doing when they call the Patriot Act the Patriot Act, or they call a bill the 9-11 bill, or they call something new freedom.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:56.322]  Or total information awareness network with an all-seeing eye beaming red light onto the earth.
[00:36:59.283 --> 00:37:00.364]  Don't think they don't know.
[00:37:00.384 --> 00:37:06.246]  I mean, it's a flaunting, snickering, in-our-face sick joke.
[00:37:06.766 --> 00:37:07.846]  And this article continues.
[00:37:08.026 --> 00:37:09.207]  Every business in America.
[00:37:10.307 --> 00:37:11.047]  You sell.
[00:37:12.168 --> 00:37:12.528]  You see the...
[00:37:13.402 --> 00:37:20.725]  What Bush put into executive order was, days after 9-11, was really the know-your-customer law that they couldn't even get the banks to adopt.
[00:37:22.046 --> 00:37:24.987]  Where when you go in, you sign a contract waiving all your rights.
[00:37:25.967 --> 00:37:35.952]  You sign a contract saying, you can take my bank account, the state can take my bank account, the county can take the bank account, the feds can take the bank account, international bodies can take my bank account.
[00:37:36.252 --> 00:37:41.294]  No charges, no arrest, no reason to waive your rights and contracts.
[00:37:42.938 --> 00:37:50.244]  But now they're admitting that, oh, under new provisions, the government's claiming the power to engage in every business.
[00:37:52.545 --> 00:38:10.119]  Why, you sell a bottle of milk to someone who might be connected to terrorists, you are going to get $500,000 to a million dollar fine and 10 years in prison.
[00:38:12.094 --> 00:38:16.096]  Still others, jewelers, vehicle dealers, travel agents, loan companies, investment firms.
[00:38:16.956 --> 00:38:17.916]  It goes on and on.
[00:38:18.316 --> 00:38:23.418]  There's word about the law spreads many businesses, and people don't like what they are hearing.
[00:38:23.819 --> 00:38:37.884]  A lot of our members are just starting to wake up to all the things they are required to do, said Karen Tenefeli, Assistant Vice President for Advocacy for the Building Owners and Managers Association International.
[00:38:38.584 --> 00:38:40.645]  When the group's executive committee held a briefing...
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:45.962]  On the act in November, she said, there was a sense that you've got to be kidding.
[00:38:47.443 --> 00:38:53.845]  Expecting businesses, especially tiny ones, to keep track of terrorists strikes some people as silly.
[00:38:54.025 --> 00:38:55.166]  It's not silly at all.
[00:38:56.827 --> 00:39:03.730]  It's just lame, said Pat Kennedy, who owns Alpine Recreation, a Morgan Hill, California RV dealership.
[00:39:04.210 --> 00:39:09.052]  I'm trying to imagine any local terrorist picking up a motorhome and doing a little camping.
[00:39:09.921 --> 00:39:34.564]  Palo Alto, California attorney Jonathan Axelard has similar concerns about the law's potential application to venture capital funds, forcing the fund's managers to monitor money laundering would simply be an expensive, unnecessary burden, he said, because the risk and withdrawal limits of such investments would likely be unattractive to terrorists.
[00:39:35.413 --> 00:39:38.615]  But terrorists are capable of using a wide range of business purchases.
[00:39:38.996 --> 00:39:40.617]  So it goes on to make excuses for it.
[00:39:43.239 --> 00:39:53.506]  And then they've got quotes here from business owners, gas station owners, people saying that we're just not doing check cashing anymore because we can't.
[00:39:54.582 --> 00:39:55.602]  Prove who people are.
[00:39:55.642 --> 00:39:56.863]  They could have fake IDs.
[00:39:57.163 --> 00:40:12.069]  But see, the government's answer is going to be through the new national ID card passed a little under a month ago that creates federal standards for all driver's licenses that were already in place in almost every state.
[00:40:12.389 --> 00:40:19.211]  Now it makes it law with the face scan, which was the digital photo, the thumbprint that Texas has had since 1993.
[00:40:21.477 --> 00:40:25.378]  Then when you go in to buy and sell, you'll have to swipe this card.
[00:40:25.578 --> 00:40:30.520]  Now, that's the official executive orders, the official plan, the official bill that passed.
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:32.180]  Still, you're in denial.
[00:40:33.881 --> 00:40:40.202]  And the public salve to the businesses, it'll be, see, this is so you're in compliance, now you won't get in trouble.
[00:40:41.323 --> 00:40:45.344]  But for the public, they're going to sell it as the new sales tax.
[00:40:45.624 --> 00:40:48.705]  Oh, we're going to cut the income tax in half.
[00:40:51.235 --> 00:40:54.797]  We're going to reduce it down to 10% for most people.
[00:40:55.877 --> 00:40:58.458]  And we promise we'll never jack it back up again.
[00:40:59.739 --> 00:41:01.860]  And we're going to have a national sales tax.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:12.464]  And yes, we don't want the poor who are at a subsistence level making less than $15,000 a year to have to pay this sales tax so they'll be exempt.
[00:41:12.544 --> 00:41:20.668]  But to stop fraud while you just swipe your driver's license that has that stripe on the back
[00:41:21.694 --> 00:41:24.497]  And everything will be okay.
[00:41:24.837 --> 00:41:29.141]  And that'll assess the sales tax, because it's been so confusing and hard on you.
[00:41:32.283 --> 00:41:33.805]  Now, this is the official plan.
[00:41:35.386 --> 00:41:36.347]  This is what they're doing.
[00:41:37.268 --> 00:41:38.529]  This is what they're implementing.
[00:41:38.849 --> 00:41:39.750]  This is what's happening.
[00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:41.111]  And I was in Diamond Shamrock.
[00:41:41.611 --> 00:41:42.992]  I told you about this a few weeks ago.
[00:41:43.032 --> 00:41:45.875]  There was a woman in front of me buying a 12-pack of Bud Light.
[00:41:48.823 --> 00:41:50.684]  And this woman had to be 40 years old.
[00:41:51.185 --> 00:41:52.746]  I mean, she even had gray in her hair.
[00:41:54.507 --> 00:42:00.851]  And the woman behind the counter, where I've been coming for years, swipes her car.
[00:42:03.313 --> 00:42:04.754]  Swipes her driver's license.
[00:42:06.866 --> 00:42:12.030]  And when the woman left, I talked to the other man behind the counter, who I've known, again, for years.
[00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:12.571]  He's worked there.
[00:42:12.591 --> 00:42:15.213]  And I said, you just swiped that woman's card.
[00:42:15.233 --> 00:42:16.855]  I mean, she's obviously over 21.
[00:42:17.075 --> 00:42:21.158]  And he said, look, we've been told, start swiping everybody.
[00:42:22.019 --> 00:42:25.362]  Everybody that buys beer or cigarettes.
[00:42:25.382 --> 00:42:27.003]  And I said, even if the person's 70?
[00:42:28.104 --> 00:42:28.684]  I've been noticing.
[00:42:28.725 --> 00:42:33.589]  I mean, I'm talking 65, 70-year-old woman and man buying cigarettes, beer, right in front of me.
[00:42:33.849 --> 00:42:35.070]  They're swiping their cards.
[00:42:36.314 --> 00:42:36.994]  And you know what he said to me?
[00:42:37.054 --> 00:42:38.495]  He said, Alex, we've been told.
[00:42:39.395 --> 00:42:40.156]  This guy's the manager.
[00:42:40.896 --> 00:42:44.538]  He said, we've been told that soon we're going to be swiping it for everything.
[00:42:45.598 --> 00:42:46.779]  And he said, there's another thing, Alex.
[00:42:46.819 --> 00:42:52.741]  This new computer system hooks in to the Texas Department of Public Safety.
[00:42:52.761 --> 00:42:56.123]  I don't want to get him in trouble.
[00:42:56.443 --> 00:42:58.564]  They won't know where he's at or which store.
[00:42:58.604 --> 00:43:00.404]  There's probably 50 of them in Austin.
[00:43:00.424 --> 00:43:04.046]  But he let me go behind the counter and look at it.
[00:43:05.959 --> 00:43:07.880]  You may even let me take some digital photos of it.
[00:43:08.401 --> 00:43:11.163]  And there was the database template.
[00:43:11.383 --> 00:43:13.344]  And he said, look, I know everything.
[00:43:13.384 --> 00:43:14.265]  I know date of birth.
[00:43:14.405 --> 00:43:15.505]  I know their information.
[00:43:15.926 --> 00:43:17.187]  I know if they have warrants.
[00:43:17.627 --> 00:43:19.328]  I know if the card is expired.
[00:43:20.529 --> 00:43:22.310]  And I said, what else have they told you?
[00:43:22.330 --> 00:43:23.451]  And he said, that's all they've told us.
[00:43:23.771 --> 00:43:25.832]  Soon we're going to be swiping everyone's card.
[00:43:26.853 --> 00:43:29.235]  Everyone's driver's license.
[00:43:30.475 --> 00:43:32.557]  And then you go to the pharmacy.
[00:43:32.657 --> 00:43:34.098]  I was at the pharmacy yesterday.
[00:43:35.254 --> 00:43:37.215]  I have to go to the pharmacy once every two years.
[00:43:37.255 --> 00:43:39.835]  Well, I was at the pharmacy yesterday.
[00:43:41.576 --> 00:43:44.336]  And there I am, sitting there for 20 minutes at a Walgreens.
[00:43:44.656 --> 00:44:02.321]  And I knew full well that for the last three years, everything you get at a pharmacy, everything that you get that is prescription, whether it's an antibiotic, it doesn't matter, a diaphragm, anything,
[00:44:05.163 --> 00:44:13.590]  No matter what you get at the pharmacy, it immediately goes into a federal and state database.
[00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:14.911]  Now, where's your Fourth Amendment?
[00:44:15.492 --> 00:44:17.393]  Oh, we've got to stop all the pill-popping.
[00:44:17.413 --> 00:44:18.834]  See, it just never ends.
[00:44:18.874 --> 00:44:20.416]  People still think there's a Fourth Amendment.
[00:44:20.676 --> 00:44:22.077]  You still think there's a Fifth Amendment.
[00:44:22.698 --> 00:44:23.819]  You think there's a First Amendment.
[00:44:23.839 --> 00:44:25.280]  They're trying to erase that right now.
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:27.962]  You see, we still have these rights because they're God-given.
[00:44:28.002 --> 00:44:28.522]  They're innate.
[00:44:29.043 --> 00:44:29.804]  Who owns you?
[00:44:29.884 --> 00:44:30.164]  You do.
[00:44:31.663 --> 00:44:32.644]  No one is your ruler.
[00:44:32.704 --> 00:44:34.445]  No one is your rightful owner and master.
[00:44:34.625 --> 00:44:39.688]  No matter how much they say, it's for your own good and to keep you safe.
[00:44:44.931 --> 00:44:46.052]  It's unbelievable.
[00:44:49.954 --> 00:44:58.159]  And, you know, I've been telling you for three years, type Patriot Act compliance into a search engine and hundreds of thousands of links will pop up.
[00:44:59.404 --> 00:45:06.790]  And it's for dog kennels and grocery stores and pharmacies and banks and pawn shops.
[00:45:06.911 --> 00:45:07.611]  It's everything.
[00:45:07.831 --> 00:45:11.034]  Here's Knight Ritter newspaper, Newswire.
[00:45:12.836 --> 00:45:14.297]  In war on terrorism, U.S.
[00:45:14.317 --> 00:45:15.978]  drafts shops to be on guard.
[00:45:17.399 --> 00:45:20.142]  And it says, now every business will be under it.
[00:45:21.763 --> 00:45:25.746]  First it's the pawn shops and check cashing and car dealerships.
[00:45:25.827 --> 00:45:27.448]  Now it's everything.
[00:45:29.338 --> 00:45:32.040]  You know, I moved a few years ago when I was buying a house.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:37.163]  He said, I'm sorry, you've got to sign this stuff, we've got all this new stuff.
[00:45:37.684 --> 00:45:43.087]  You know, basically, we have to run a background check on you too, and make sure you're not a terrorist.
[00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:47.650]  You know, because the terrorists are out buying houses.
[00:45:48.771 --> 00:45:50.832]  And they're evil, and they're going to get us any minute.
[00:45:50.972 --> 00:45:51.913]  Folks, this is for you.
[00:45:51.933 --> 00:45:52.894]  Okay?
[00:45:53.294 --> 00:45:56.256]  You know, does the woman buying a 12-pack of bud...
[00:46:00.385 --> 00:46:01.686]  Is she a terrorist?
[00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:08.872]  Just a few other issues, then I'm going to go to your calls, Mark and Tim and Jason and others.
[00:46:08.952 --> 00:46:09.852]  I just had to cover this.
[00:46:13.015 --> 00:46:23.763]  I don't normally respond to criticism that this broadcast gets, but occasionally I go surfing around the web and look at what people are saying about me, and it's almost always the same type of stuff.
[00:46:24.663 --> 00:46:27.726]  I heard Alex Jones in November...
[00:46:31.225 --> 00:46:35.728]  And he had on a State National Guard police officer.
[00:46:35.768 --> 00:46:38.209]  That guy's a police officer and also State National Guard.
[00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:45.274]  And he was saying there was going to be martial law in December, and it never happened.
[00:46:45.934 --> 00:46:50.517]  You know, how many times did I say, ad nauseum, and the archives were up around the site,
[00:46:51.406 --> 00:46:52.967]  I mean, how many times did U.S.
[00:46:52.987 --> 00:46:57.650]  News & World report, USA Today, we will be hit, there's going to be an attack.
[00:46:57.690 --> 00:47:01.372]  And I would say, I'm not saying there's going to be an attack.
[00:47:02.213 --> 00:47:03.633]  I'm going to read U.S.
[00:47:03.693 --> 00:47:05.174]  News & World report now.
[00:47:07.796 --> 00:47:08.876]  They're fear-mongering.
[00:47:09.157 --> 00:47:11.018]  They're putting out fake terror alerts.
[00:47:13.919 --> 00:47:19.843]  But I guess for people that want to deny what I'm talking about and doing, anything is a psychological excuse to ignore it.
[00:47:20.430 --> 00:47:46.558]  We had the police officer slash State National Guard individual on, who I've known for, I don't know, six, seven years, because he brought me the 300-page sensitive, not secret, but sensitive, marked sensitive, not for distribution, document they were issued that said house-to-house arrest, disarming of civilians, this new mission.
[00:47:46.678 --> 00:47:48.279]  And two weeks after I reported it,
[00:47:49.011 --> 00:47:53.775]  It was in the Austin Chronicle, the Austin American Statesman, and the Houston Chronicle.
[00:47:56.136 --> 00:48:00.340]  The point is, they've trained for it, they've changed their mission, it's in the manual.
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:08.045]  That's what we said, and we said, and look, the government's running around talking about big attacks and civil emergency and red alerts and all this.
[00:48:10.767 --> 00:48:16.231]  But see, people who don't want to face all this, they'll take it and go, no, he said there was going to be a terror attack.
[00:48:16.492 --> 00:48:17.833]  He said there was going to be martial law.
[00:48:17.913 --> 00:48:18.073]  No.
[00:48:20.222 --> 00:48:29.409]  The police officer, slash State National Guard officer, was told, yes, it's going to happen.
[00:48:29.810 --> 00:48:34.814]  And they're always telling their people this, to keep them all on edge and freaked out, to go along with what they're being told.
[00:48:36.035 --> 00:48:40.638]  They're always, I mean, it's been all in the news, we're going to be attacked, we're going to be, you've seen it.
[00:48:41.019 --> 00:48:47.704]  Well, they do it even worse to the police, and to the security forces, our internal security forces.
[00:48:49.443 --> 00:48:50.844]  Meanwhile, our border's wide open.
[00:48:50.904 --> 00:49:08.714]  So, the mental twister, the mental gyrations and gymnastics and gesticulations that I see, every time I see a criticism of myself, it's not a legitimate one.
[00:49:09.154 --> 00:49:14.557]  Now, if you want some stuff to criticize me about, there's lots of legitimate reasons, and I could name them for you.
[00:49:15.057 --> 00:49:16.979]  One of my worst critics, but it's never those.
[00:49:19.412 --> 00:49:22.855]  It's always some manufactured thing.
[00:49:26.257 --> 00:49:27.478]  And quite frankly, I'm tired of it.
[00:49:27.898 --> 00:49:29.179]  A bunch of other news coming up.
[00:49:29.239 --> 00:49:30.040]  Big guess as well.
[00:49:30.060 --> 00:49:31.000]  But first, let's go to calls.
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:32.021]  Mark in California.
[00:49:32.041 --> 00:49:32.641]  Thanks for holding.
[00:49:32.662 --> 00:49:33.082]  Go ahead.
[00:49:33.642 --> 00:49:34.103]  Hey, Alex.
[00:49:34.123 --> 00:49:34.563]  Are you there?
[00:49:34.843 --> 00:49:35.163]  Yes, sir.
[00:49:35.423 --> 00:49:35.884]  Hey, hey.
[00:49:36.124 --> 00:49:37.625]  I got some questions for you, please.
[00:49:38.285 --> 00:49:46.251]  And number one, I heard that with nanotech, they can artificially create gold at the atomic level.
[00:49:46.311 --> 00:49:47.252]  Is that true or not?
[00:49:48.408 --> 00:50:05.943]  I don't know about nanotech, but I do know that there is a process they've had for 25, 30 years where they send large amounts of electricity with different fields and generators into a piece of metal, and they've created dozens and dozens of new elements.
[00:50:06.835 --> 00:50:10.158]  So yes, they can turn silver into gold.
[00:50:11.439 --> 00:50:15.502]  It just takes the amount of power to run a city for a day.
[00:50:15.522 --> 00:50:18.825]  It takes so much power to do that.
[00:50:19.345 --> 00:50:21.527]  So it's not worth it, or is gold in trouble?
[00:50:25.530 --> 00:50:27.952]  It's not just turning one metal to another.
[00:50:28.412 --> 00:50:29.713]  They've even made new elements.
[00:50:29.954 --> 00:50:31.455]  And no, because...
[00:50:33.240 --> 00:50:40.083]  Diamonds are in trouble because you can grow them that are even better, but they're not in trouble because people still have value in the original diamond.
[00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:42.845]  Diamonds are artificially scarce.
[00:50:43.565 --> 00:50:49.608]  Gold is artificially more common because they suppress the price.
[00:50:49.668 --> 00:50:50.208]  Anything else?
[00:50:50.648 --> 00:50:52.109]  I have, like, yeah, could you hold me over?
[00:50:52.129 --> 00:50:52.830]  Sure, stay there.
[00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:55.151]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:50:56.011 --> 00:50:57.352]  Stay with us, prisonplanet.tv.
[00:51:01.132 --> 00:51:07.979]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:09.661]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:51:09.841 --> 00:51:12.064]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:51:12.204 --> 00:51:14.306]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:51:14.566 --> 00:51:19.511]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:51:19.852 --> 00:51:23.876]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:51:24.116 --> 00:51:25.897]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:51:25.977 --> 00:51:36.622]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:51:36.762 --> 00:51:38.683]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:51:38.863 --> 00:51:42.745]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:51:42.845 --> 00:51:44.105]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:51:47.927 --> 00:51:49.911]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:51:49.971 --> 00:51:54.942]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:51:55.182 --> 00:51:55.904]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:52:00.265 --> 00:52:07.771]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[00:52:08.052 --> 00:52:18.961]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[00:52:19.181 --> 00:52:19.461]  I think so.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:52.544]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:52:52.564 --> 00:52:53.064]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:07.902]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:08.142 --> 00:53:10.383]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:10.583 --> 00:53:16.925]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:17.265 --> 00:53:17.926]  We're good to go.
[00:53:32.836 --> 00:53:33.336]  We're good to go.
[00:53:33.356 --> 00:53:33.656]  I think?
[00:54:07.885 --> 00:54:13.768]  Caller to call in and give me the exact name of the process was back in sixth grade.
[00:54:13.808 --> 00:54:28.276]  We had a science teacher who was a real nice lady, I forget her name, and she showed us a video of these giant complexes, huge field generators, and
[00:54:29.113 --> 00:54:41.081]  Through this incredible process of sending all of these different fields and electrical charges into different metals, they're actually able to create all these new elements.
[00:54:42.362 --> 00:54:45.084]  And then there's another process that I learned about years later.
[00:54:45.505 --> 00:54:46.585]  Is it fission fusion?
[00:54:47.906 --> 00:54:50.228]  Not cold fusion, it's fission fusion, isn't it?
[00:54:50.588 --> 00:54:51.709]  That's where they have these giant...
[00:54:52.387 --> 00:54:57.808]  Magnetic fields, and they create artificial suns that create all this power, but they can't contain them.
[00:54:58.428 --> 00:55:03.609]  You probably saw a Hollywood rendition of that in the new Spider-Man movie that came out.
[00:55:04.049 --> 00:55:11.051]  They feel that where that sun starts sucking everything into it, and there's actually a danger in that, but I can't remember the name of that either.
[00:55:11.091 --> 00:55:11.951]  I'm not a scientist.
[00:55:12.031 --> 00:55:18.272]  I just read all the different scientific publications, or at least I did in the past when I had time to do it, but that's a very interesting point.
[00:55:19.446 --> 00:55:22.068]  We should spend more time on all these advanced technologies.
[00:55:22.388 --> 00:55:25.591]  Stuff that's been around for decades that the average person isn't even aware of.
[00:55:26.051 --> 00:55:29.733]  And there's so many of these developments, I don't even remember all the names of them.
[00:55:30.594 --> 00:55:33.156]  But your question about gold, how is gold doing?
[00:55:34.056 --> 00:55:39.160]  The gold I bought three years ago has almost doubled in value to answer you.
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:44.301]  And the tiny amount of stock I own that I was given is almost worthless.
[00:55:44.381 --> 00:55:46.161]  So that's how gold is doing.
[00:55:46.181 --> 00:55:52.903]  But I have no doubt that they won't come up or already have processes where they could make artificial gold.
[00:55:53.643 --> 00:55:58.384]  But I would imagine the globalists would keep that secret like they do most of their high-tech stuff.
[00:55:58.664 --> 00:55:59.465]  Anything else, Mark?
[00:56:01.805 --> 00:56:03.005]  You there, Mark, in California?
[00:56:03.946 --> 00:56:05.966]  He wanted to hold over, but he didn't.
[00:56:06.746 --> 00:56:08.087]  Tim in Missouri.
[00:56:08.387 --> 00:56:09.047]  You're on the air.
[00:56:09.107 --> 00:56:09.487]  Go ahead.
[00:56:10.615 --> 00:56:11.255]  Hey, how you doing?
[00:56:11.475 --> 00:56:11.876]  Good, sir.
[00:56:12.156 --> 00:56:13.937]  I just want to run across something real quick.
[00:56:13.997 --> 00:56:18.659]  Local affiliate, KSHB, NBC affiliate in Kansas City.
[00:56:18.819 --> 00:56:22.161]  Metro family blames death on war-related illness.
[00:56:22.401 --> 00:56:23.981]  They're talking about depleted uranium.
[00:56:24.021 --> 00:56:28.364]  A 35-year-old Army Sergeant, Clay Garson, spent 16 months in Iraq.
[00:56:28.404 --> 00:56:29.824]  He was in Fallujah in May.
[00:56:30.665 --> 00:56:32.526]  They just sat there and let him die.
[00:56:32.566 --> 00:56:35.387]  There's media coverage all over Kansas City.
[00:56:36.087 --> 00:56:37.248]  They have a video link at...
[00:56:40.277 --> 00:56:42.659]  Your phone was breaking up, or maybe my audio was.
[00:56:42.699 --> 00:56:43.679]  Give me that slowly.
[00:56:44.100 --> 00:56:50.024]  Is that KSHB?
[00:56:50.204 --> 00:56:50.384]  Yes.
[00:56:51.125 --> 00:56:54.668]  He was talking about a Metro soldier that they just sat there and let die.
[00:56:54.728 --> 00:56:55.969]  He was 35 years old.
[00:56:56.049 --> 00:56:57.530]  He spent 16 months in Iraq.
[00:56:57.710 --> 00:56:58.971]  He was in Fallujah in May.
[00:56:59.531 --> 00:57:00.292]  And they are saying...
[00:57:00.987 --> 00:57:05.532]  They claim he was exposed to fleeting uranium dust during the rescue mission in Fallujah.
[00:57:05.992 --> 00:57:11.678]  I've got to get Dr. Rocky, who literally wrote the training manuals for the Pentagon on DU.
[00:57:11.718 --> 00:57:13.540]  His team was sent there in 1991.
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:15.181]  Most of his team has died.
[00:57:15.221 --> 00:57:16.963]  He's had cancer several times.
[00:57:17.584 --> 00:57:19.666]  And they knew in the 80s that it killed you.
[00:57:20.533 --> 00:57:22.134]  And they don't care, do they?
[00:57:22.194 --> 00:57:24.837]  That's supporting the troops is not caring about them.
[00:57:24.877 --> 00:57:26.438]  I was just surprised that it's on TV.
[00:57:26.538 --> 00:57:27.599]  I've watched all the video.
[00:57:27.619 --> 00:57:29.100]  They do have the video link there.
[00:57:29.260 --> 00:57:32.763]  I sent it to you at tipsandinfowar.com, the whole story, just in case they pulled it.
[00:57:32.783 --> 00:57:34.324]  And that's KSHB?
[00:57:34.644 --> 00:57:34.864]  Yes.
[00:57:34.964 --> 00:57:35.325]  You know what?
[00:57:35.345 --> 00:57:36.386]  I'm going to put you on hold.
[00:57:36.446 --> 00:57:39.748]  I'm going to give you the network producer's phone number.
[00:57:39.888 --> 00:57:43.051]  I want the entire link, and we'll download that and play it.
[00:57:44.232 --> 00:57:45.072]  Can I do that, Tim?
[00:57:45.213 --> 00:57:45.593]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:45.893 --> 00:57:46.934]  Very pertinent call.
[00:57:47.014 --> 00:57:49.456]  Scott, will you get the entire address and download it, please?
[00:57:50.276 --> 00:57:51.377]  That is very important.
[00:57:51.977 --> 00:57:58.881]  That's the type of call I like that is bringing us some vital information.
[00:57:58.921 --> 00:58:04.223]  So we will end this hour and come back and take more calls and hopefully get that clip.
[00:58:04.384 --> 00:58:11.047]  There's also about a five-minute tribute to Gary Webb with one of the last interviews he did that I want to air a little bit later.
[00:58:13.149 --> 00:58:25.904]  Post it on prisonplanet.tv, I believe, but we'll play it here on the broadcast as well, and we'll hurry through more of your calls as we start the second hour and get into a whole stack of really vital news and information.
[00:58:26.858 --> 00:58:29.140]  Before I end this hour, just a quick 20-second plug.
[00:58:29.481 --> 00:58:43.473]  PrisonPlanet.tv, dozens of other great films made by wonderful researchers, 11 of my films, my weekly TV special reports, my best audio interviews, 15 since today if you sign up for a year, 19 since today if you sign up for a month.
[00:58:44.234 --> 00:58:46.175]  If you're online, folks, you're missing out.
[00:58:46.195 --> 00:58:49.018]  If you're not a PrisonPlanet.tv member, stay with us.
[00:58:57.705 --> 00:58:58.365]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.006 --> 00:59:00.086]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.786 --> 00:59:01.927]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.527 --> 00:59:03.388]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.408 --> 00:59:05.008]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.028 --> 00:59:09.590]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:14.052]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:17.414 --> 00:59:18.574]  All right, my friends.
[00:59:19.395 --> 00:59:20.975]  Now into hour number two.
[00:59:21.075 --> 00:59:23.916]  Coming up in 30 minutes, John Perkins.
[00:59:24.497 --> 00:59:27.018]  The highest levels of international banking cartel.
[00:59:28.433 --> 00:59:34.175]  Confessions of an Economic Hitman inside the New World Order, folks, coming up in 30 minutes.
[00:59:34.235 --> 00:59:36.516]  Right now, more of your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:59:36.536 --> 00:59:42.798]  You know, I don't spend enough time on this.
[00:59:42.818 --> 00:59:51.301]  We talk about aspartame and sodium fluoride and depleted uranium and all these things that are hurting our population and other populations so badly.
[00:59:52.802 --> 01:00:04.612]  There's other simpler things like the documented hundreds of major studies showing that it's vitamin C deficiency and potassium deficiency that causes your arteries to collapse and fall apart.
[01:00:05.052 --> 01:00:10.497]  A kind of localized scurvy in the arteries which causes the collagen to break down.
[01:00:11.238 --> 01:00:14.961]  Just eat more vitamin C and don't have heart attacks and don't get cancer.
[01:00:15.181 --> 01:00:16.463]  But let's just ignore all that.
[01:00:16.743 --> 01:00:20.126]  That's the kind of stuff I should be talking about as a public service announcement.
[01:00:20.546 --> 01:00:21.307]  Here's another one.
[01:00:21.707 --> 01:00:24.609]  Mobile phone radiation harms DNA.
[01:00:24.970 --> 01:00:26.371]  New study finds.
[01:00:26.871 --> 01:00:31.015]  There's squadrons of studies by prestigious universities.
[01:00:31.795 --> 01:00:34.418]  And still, I stick a mobile phone up to my head.
[01:00:34.558 --> 01:00:35.338]  I'm an idiot.
[01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:38.721]  Why do we still drink tap water?
[01:00:38.821 --> 01:00:39.362]  I quit that.
[01:00:39.955 --> 01:00:41.516]  Why do we not drink enough vitamin C?
[01:00:41.676 --> 01:00:42.037]  I do.
[01:00:42.457 --> 01:00:48.141]  But why do I still put a cell phone up to my head and forget to put the navigator, you know, the little earpiece?
[01:00:48.702 --> 01:00:51.744]  Why don't I buy a wireless headpiece, which they say are really safe?
[01:00:52.444 --> 01:00:53.885]  Why are we so stupid?
[01:00:54.446 --> 01:00:55.687]  Why don't we wake up?
[01:00:55.827 --> 01:00:57.188]  I'm talking about myself here.
[01:00:59.590 --> 01:01:00.490]  Ah, man.
[01:01:00.711 --> 01:01:06.635]  Why do we give millions of children, what is it, over 10 million, Ritalin and Prozac, when we know it's deadly for them?
[01:01:07.978 --> 01:01:12.960]  All right, I'm kind of going off into a rant right now, and I don't need to do that, but I'll get into more on that.
[01:01:14.901 --> 01:01:19.043]  There is just so much here I want to cover, folks, and it's all coming up.
[01:01:19.723 --> 01:01:21.364]  Right now, let's talk to Jason.
[01:01:21.444 --> 01:01:22.765]  Jason, where are you calling us from?
[01:01:23.225 --> 01:01:23.745]  Arizona.
[01:01:23.765 --> 01:01:37.371]  You know, speaking of the cell phones, my work just got its brand new T-Mobile ones, and it states inside the manual that if you don't put that chip in there, the one that I've seen on your documentaries, that it won't work.
[01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:44.931]  And on top of that, that it stores the phone numbers, not on the phone itself, but in that card.
[01:01:45.131 --> 01:01:47.672]  So all your phone numbers can be uplinked to wherever.
[01:01:48.972 --> 01:01:49.732]  Well, that's the point.
[01:01:49.752 --> 01:01:52.053]  It's like with the implantable chips or RFID.
[01:01:52.073 --> 01:01:54.513]  They go, it's just an identification number.
[01:01:54.793 --> 01:01:57.073]  Yeah, that number links to the database.
[01:01:57.794 --> 01:02:05.395]  Yeah, and everybody I know for Christmas, I got them to make copies of The Road to Tyranny and your documentaries, all that I have,
[01:02:06.286 --> 01:02:08.107]  And now, it's waking people up.
[01:02:08.327 --> 01:02:10.488]  Now, I have people that actually want to do something.
[01:02:10.508 --> 01:02:11.469]  And I had another question.
[01:02:11.889 --> 01:02:21.313]  After your contest for the radio spot and your commercial for the ArnoldExposed.com, would you still be accepting those and running them even after the contest is over?
[01:02:22.034 --> 01:02:22.294]  You know...
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:23.921]  It's interesting.
[01:02:23.961 --> 01:02:29.565]  I can get a couple thousand emails a day, but then on my Arnold contest, we've only gotten a few entries.
[01:02:29.605 --> 01:02:30.866]  That's why I extended it out.
[01:02:31.326 --> 01:02:31.506]  Right.
[01:02:31.566 --> 01:02:40.133]  It's a 60-second or 30-second TV spot, a 60- or 30-second radio spot, and a $2,000 prize for the TV spot.
[01:02:40.473 --> 01:02:45.016]  And I'm going to give it to somebody, but I hope people make these and give us more entries.
[01:02:45.076 --> 01:02:46.718]  And, yes, we're going to post them on the website.
[01:02:47.218 --> 01:02:48.619]  Okay, because I'm almost done with mine.
[01:02:48.659 --> 01:02:51.081]  I'm going to send it out to you here hopefully by the end of this week.
[01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:52.562]  That's why I was just asking.
[01:02:53.012 --> 01:02:57.033]  Yes, and just make sure when you mail it to me that you're specific.
[01:02:57.173 --> 01:03:02.115]  And if you want to upload a copy to the web and email it to us so we get it even earlier, that would be great.
[01:03:02.915 --> 01:03:06.276]  Okay, I can just send it because I'm no problem.
[01:03:06.696 --> 01:03:09.197]  I'll just give you the hard copy and you guys can put it on there.
[01:03:10.377 --> 01:03:10.778]  Excellent.
[01:03:11.278 --> 01:03:12.178]  All right, thank you very much.
[01:03:12.558 --> 01:03:13.378]  Hey, thanks a million.
[01:03:13.398 --> 01:03:16.679]  I appreciate you giving copies of the films to people.
[01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:21.161]  And folks need to read the contest rules at ArnoldExposed.com.
[01:03:23.089 --> 01:03:25.111]  There's frankly a bunch of other rules I need to add.
[01:03:25.211 --> 01:03:28.733]  Like it can't be a bunch of copyrighted material.
[01:03:29.034 --> 01:03:31.416]  It has to be documented what you're saying about Schwarzenegger.
[01:03:32.997 --> 01:03:34.478]  A lot of things.
[01:03:34.778 --> 01:03:36.119]  And I'm busy making an ad.
[01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:38.221]  Like I said, I'm just so overwhelmed.
[01:03:38.681 --> 01:03:40.903]  I'm working too much, but I enjoy it overall.
[01:03:40.923 --> 01:03:44.005]  All right, we'll come back, take more calls, get into more news.
[01:03:44.826 --> 01:03:46.127]  Toll-free number to join us, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:03:46.147 --> 01:03:46.587]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:54.071 --> 01:03:56.994]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:03:57.655 --> 01:03:58.956]  Alex Jones here, America.
[01:03:59.157 --> 01:04:04.903]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[01:04:05.183 --> 01:04:10.429]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[01:04:10.729 --> 01:04:14.854]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[01:04:15.034 --> 01:04:30.068]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged, witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips, troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:04:30.108 --> 01:04:31.930]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:34.491]  Order 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny today.
[01:04:34.591 --> 01:04:37.951]  Call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:38.252 --> 01:04:40.992]  That's 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:41.712 --> 01:04:46.113]  Or order online at infowars.com or infowars.net.
[01:04:46.213 --> 01:04:48.234]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[01:04:48.454 --> 01:04:49.994]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:50.154 --> 01:04:52.255]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[01:04:53.070 --> 01:04:56.332]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[01:04:56.392 --> 01:05:00.575]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[01:05:00.815 --> 01:05:03.596]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[01:05:03.797 --> 01:05:06.218]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[01:05:06.398 --> 01:05:15.043]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[01:05:15.224 --> 01:05:16.584]  The Berkey Light is different.
[01:05:16.764 --> 01:05:20.947]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[01:05:21.267 --> 01:05:22.028]  We're good to go.
[01:05:52.591 --> 01:05:55.633]  You and your family members getting enough minerals on the daily diet?
[01:05:56.013 --> 01:05:58.514]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:05:58.734 --> 01:06:05.818]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:06:05.998 --> 01:06:11.581]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard is more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:06:11.922 --> 01:06:19.746]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:06:19.906 --> 01:06:20.586]  We're good to go.
[01:06:50.146 --> 01:06:58.408]  SceneMineral.com Big Brother.
[01:06:59.069 --> 01:07:00.149]  Mainstream media.
[01:07:00.849 --> 01:07:01.969]  Government cover-ups.
[01:07:02.590 --> 01:07:03.430]  You want answers?
[01:07:04.170 --> 01:07:05.090]  Well, so does he.
[01:07:05.750 --> 01:07:09.652]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:09.912 --> 01:07:13.973]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:07:25.916 --> 01:07:28.536]  8 minutes, 30 seconds into the second hour.
[01:07:31.017 --> 01:07:34.418]  Monday through Friday, 11 to 2 Central, back from 9 to midnight.
[01:07:34.478 --> 01:07:36.978]  Toll-free number to join us, on-air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:07:41.778 --> 01:07:43.038]  Let's go back to the calls.
[01:07:43.198 --> 01:07:44.839]  Kelly in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:07:44.899 --> 01:07:45.239]  Welcome.
[01:07:45.479 --> 01:07:46.259]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:07:47.180 --> 01:07:47.760]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:48.320]  Yes, hello.
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:49.020]  Yeah, how are you?
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:49.400]  Can you hear me?
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:50.120]  Good, yes, you can.
[01:07:50.140 --> 01:07:50.421]  Okay, great.
[01:07:50.481 --> 01:07:52.841]  Yeah, I have a quick anecdote and a short question.
[01:07:52.881 --> 01:07:56.202]  It may be a little bit too broad, and if you don't have time to cover it in detail, I understand.
[01:07:56.642 --> 01:07:59.063]  The anecdote refers to the stuff you were talking about earlier.
[01:07:59.083 --> 01:08:09.186]  I'm in my early 50s, and I went into a chain video store, and I paid cash or was going to pay cash for a video game for myself, walked up to the counter,
[01:08:09.958 --> 01:08:11.139]  And the lady says, are you over 17?
[01:08:11.399 --> 01:08:16.882]  And I just arched my eyebrow and looked at her like, you've got to be kidding me.
[01:08:18.943 --> 01:08:21.784]  And since I didn't respond, she says, I have to ask you that question.
[01:08:22.404 --> 01:08:25.386]  And I said, I'm 15, being sarcastic, of course.
[01:08:25.726 --> 01:08:27.567]  And she said, now I have to see your ID.
[01:08:28.368 --> 01:08:30.048]  And I said, no, you don't have to see anything.
[01:08:30.088 --> 01:08:31.149]  You just lost a sale.
[01:08:31.269 --> 01:08:31.689]  I left.
[01:08:32.410 --> 01:08:38.453]  Hopefully, if enough people have that type of response, maybe from the ground up, we can get rid of some of these
[01:08:39.394 --> 01:08:42.856]  It's ridiculous methods of paying and buying and bartering.
[01:08:43.736 --> 01:09:06.407]  The broad question I have is, coming from kind of the academic left background, I took it as an article of faith in the 70s and 80s and 90s that it seemed that I've always understood that the United States, corporate and military might, we kind of, the United States benefited for many, many years as far as the world's resources and monopolizing
[01:09:07.032 --> 01:09:08.193]  In other words, our U.S.
[01:09:08.233 --> 01:09:19.319]  standard of living has always been artificially higher than third world countries because of the fact that we've exploited the resources of other nations.
[01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:25.702]  And so I'm just wondering, is the globalist plan sort of... Are they trying to level the playing field?
[01:09:26.022 --> 01:09:29.024]  And in their view, that's probably not a bad thing.
[01:09:29.044 --> 01:09:33.626]  I'm just saying that our Americans basically spoiled as far as the standard of living.
[01:09:33.666 --> 01:09:34.406]  And is that why...
[01:09:35.731 --> 01:09:42.273]  Despite some of the draconian measures that are being enacted, we still have people trying to flood to the country because it's still so much better here than it is elsewhere.
[01:09:42.593 --> 01:09:43.054]  I've got to run.
[01:09:43.094 --> 01:09:45.254]  I'll let you answer that or address that on the air.
[01:09:45.274 --> 01:09:45.835]  Thanks.
[01:09:46.075 --> 01:09:47.095]  Well, thank you, sir.
[01:09:49.036 --> 01:09:55.298]  Very interesting, complex, detailed question that you could literally...
[01:09:56.301 --> 01:09:58.963]  You talk about being an academia at a college.
[01:09:59.003 --> 01:10:00.945]  I mean, you could have a whole course on that.
[01:10:00.985 --> 01:10:03.567]  You could have a whole degree on globalism.
[01:10:03.607 --> 01:10:05.088]  In fact, I think they do have those, don't they?
[01:10:05.448 --> 01:10:09.691]  They have whole special schools set up for the pros and cons of it.
[01:10:10.892 --> 01:10:12.533]  I mean, how to try to answer that?
[01:10:12.653 --> 01:10:15.435]  First, let me comment on your first comment.
[01:10:15.455 --> 01:10:21.660]  Let me comment on your comment before I get to your question.
[01:10:23.041 --> 01:10:28.745]  Your encyclopedic question, because it's really hard to answer and do fair justice to it.
[01:10:30.146 --> 01:10:32.907]  So I'll have to, in my opinion, try to condense it down.
[01:10:33.648 --> 01:10:45.255]  But for those that just joined us, what he was alluding to was something that we talked about in the last hour, and that was out of Knight Ritter News Service.
[01:10:45.996 --> 01:10:48.097]  In war on terrorism, U.S.
[01:10:48.177 --> 01:10:50.599]  drafts shops to be on guard.
[01:10:52.649 --> 01:11:02.817]  And the Patriot Act and these new executive orders isn't just for banks and loan officers and pawn shops and jewelers.
[01:11:02.957 --> 01:11:14.826]  Now it's going to be for all sales, all business, a $500,000 to $1,000,000 fine, $500,000 to $1,000,000 fine, 10 years in federal prison if you sell anything to anyone who is on a criminal or terrorist watch list.
[01:11:22.603 --> 01:11:28.565]  Now, you can read this right now at PrisonPlanet.com, a direct link to Knight Ritter News Service.
[01:11:30.505 --> 01:11:33.826]  The specific story posted at GannettTimes.com.
[01:11:37.407 --> 01:11:47.470]  And so this fella, I believe he said he was in his mid-40s, goes in to a video slash...
[01:11:48.672 --> 01:11:54.093]  Video game store, because video games are such a big business now that most video stores are 50-50.
[01:11:54.693 --> 01:11:56.094]  Why do I get into such inane stuff?
[01:11:56.114 --> 01:12:02.515]  The point is that he goes in there to buy a video game.
[01:12:03.516 --> 01:12:08.817]  And oh, there's a parental advisement on this video game.
[01:12:11.037 --> 01:12:13.598]  Probably has some machine gunning or tanks blowing up.
[01:12:13.638 --> 01:12:14.698]  I don't know what game it was.
[01:12:15.978 --> 01:12:17.599]  And so I need to argue
[01:12:19.641 --> 01:12:29.550]  18.
[01:12:21.943 --> 01:12:29.550]  And again, I see gray-haired women having their IDs swiped for beer, and the guy behind the counter goes, Look, Alex, it's connected into the police!
[01:12:32.472 --> 01:12:34.614]  Look, Alex, it's a database!
[01:12:34.674 --> 01:12:40.319]  I mean, the federal laws they're passing say this is going to happen, and the average person is still in denial.
[01:12:40.359 --> 01:12:40.699]  So, yes...
[01:12:41.388 --> 01:12:44.629]  His solution towards all of us is boycotting now.
[01:12:45.269 --> 01:12:49.410]  That's why I said you've got to boycott the driver's license that have this in them before it's too late.
[01:12:49.930 --> 01:12:53.191]  You've got to boycott the stores that are doing this.
[01:12:53.211 --> 01:13:01.774]  A few years ago, I go back and forth and be honest with you, smoking cigarettes is just horrible.
[01:13:01.794 --> 01:13:10.096]  I don't know why I could ever be somebody in perfect shape and then start smoking cigarettes again and then stop smoking cigarettes, but I was buying some nicotine patches.
[01:13:10.939 --> 01:13:12.160]  And I look older than I am.
[01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:17.704]  But most people say I look like I'm about 40.
[01:13:20.046 --> 01:13:22.588]  And the lady behind the counter said, I want to see your ID.
[01:13:24.890 --> 01:13:26.131]  And it wasn't a prescription thing.
[01:13:26.171 --> 01:13:27.372]  It was just right there on the drug counter.
[01:13:27.752 --> 01:13:29.033]  I was just like, come on, lady.
[01:13:30.274 --> 01:13:33.136]  But again, this is about the mindlessness of it.
[01:13:33.977 --> 01:13:37.039]  And the corporations and the corporate minds that are in league with the globalists
[01:13:38.286 --> 01:13:39.246]  Who are the globalists?
[01:13:39.406 --> 01:13:45.147]  They are all there to make sure we put up with any level of idiocy they put out.
[01:13:46.628 --> 01:13:49.948]  And now it's going to integrate with the national ID card through your driver's license.
[01:13:50.168 --> 01:13:50.909]  And this is admitted.
[01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:58.490]  And so, really, really good point that you brought up there, number one, sir.
[01:13:59.590 --> 01:14:07.132]  Now, your question was, well, it's true that Americans are 4% of the world population.
[01:14:07.771 --> 01:14:08.352]  Four percent.
[01:14:08.772 --> 01:14:14.257]  But we had, and that's a had in the past tense, half of the world's wealth.
[01:14:19.081 --> 01:14:24.405]  And so when you listen to the left on NPR or something, they go, oh, globalism's great, it's going to bring down our standard.
[01:14:24.726 --> 01:14:26.067]  We've been living too high on the hog.
[01:14:26.107 --> 01:14:27.268]  We deserve this.
[01:14:32.245 --> 01:14:38.847]  And at a certain level, at a certain area, or sector, or strata of that, it's true.
[01:14:40.707 --> 01:14:56.771]  Yes, part of our higher standard of living was because we were the center of the globalist empire, the center of the bipolar world, of the western half of that back during the Cold War, and even going back to gunboat diplomacy 150 years ago in Latin America, and
[01:15:00.925 --> 01:15:02.106]  To a certain extent, it's true.
[01:15:02.286 --> 01:15:05.910]  Our prosperity is because of imperial activities in the past.
[01:15:06.631 --> 01:15:16.881]  And because we were still a free market, and because we had more freedoms than other countries in the past, not saying we're perfect, you know, the academics will argue, well, we weren't really free.
[01:15:16.901 --> 01:15:18.002]  Well, freer than others...
[01:15:18.729 --> 01:15:23.991]  That created a big middle class and a lot of wealth separate from the elite.
[01:15:24.291 --> 01:15:31.593]  The elite now has dominated the world and they're in the process of economically looting us now as they've done the rest of the planet.
[01:15:31.613 --> 01:15:32.553]  So I'll say it like this.
[01:15:33.814 --> 01:15:35.274]  80% of our wealth was earned.
[01:15:36.454 --> 01:15:40.176]  America was built on the free market.
[01:15:40.736 --> 01:15:41.516]  Predominantly.
[01:15:41.536 --> 01:15:47.658]  You have the robber barons and the railroads and the big mine cartels and
[01:15:48.248 --> 01:15:49.509]  They did a lot of really bad stuff.
[01:15:50.689 --> 01:15:53.551]  But still, they only had about 20% of the wealth.
[01:15:54.071 --> 01:15:57.653]  Now at the turn of the last century, that started accelerating and changing.
[01:16:03.915 --> 01:16:13.760]  And so if you look at all the economic numbers, and get into real, just organic economics, not all the hyperbole that we're given, the different schools of thought, it's pretty simple.
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:17.302]  We're now being economically raped, like the rest of the world has been,
[01:16:18.032 --> 01:16:31.441]  And then the globalists put out, through their NPRs and the rest of it, through their Noam Chomskis, this spin through their academics and their gurus, that, oh, well, this is a consequence, and we've lived too high on the hog, and this is a good thing.
[01:16:32.222 --> 01:16:37.085]  When in truth, the free market is being dismantled and going to a fascist system.
[01:16:37.666 --> 01:16:46.672]  And a few years ago, I had the epiphany, the understanding, that Karl Marx and Lenin and Stalin and that whole train of individuals...
[01:16:47.755 --> 01:16:55.943]  From Engels and Marx right through to Khrushchev, they always said that socialism leads to communism.
[01:16:56.523 --> 01:16:57.604]  And that's not true.
[01:16:58.625 --> 01:17:03.450]  Communism doesn't exist other than in certain species of insects.
[01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:08.034]  Bees and ants and things along those lines.
[01:17:12.663 --> 01:17:21.166]  Socialism is a tool of the economic elite to con the serfs, to go along with centralization of power.
[01:17:23.207 --> 01:17:36.632]  It is the tiny 1% ultra-elite, fraction of 1%, using propaganda to tell the howling mob the founding fathers talked about, oh, let's go get the rich people, and then the ultra-elite
[01:17:37.600 --> 01:18:07.104]  Designate the middle class as the rich people and the poor people don't differentiate, attack the free market, ask for a socialized system, then the government builds the massive wealth redistribution network and then uses that system of extractors and mechanisms to pull the wealth out of the middle class, change the economic and political paradigm and the culture, and then centralize power.
[01:18:08.044 --> 01:18:14.345]  For the private interests that are not free market, that are organized crime syndicates, or feudal lords is the best way to term them.
[01:18:16.226 --> 01:18:22.607]  And so, in truth, socialism always leads to fascism.
[01:18:23.507 --> 01:18:26.668]  China today, handful of private families run the whole place.
[01:18:26.968 --> 01:18:27.948]  Same thing with Russia.
[01:18:29.069 --> 01:18:30.909]  Same thing with all these countries.
[01:18:32.129 --> 01:18:35.710]  And it's set up like that by the big banks, by design.
[01:18:36.784 --> 01:18:43.889]  And meanwhile, people are like computers, being given bad information, false political paradigms at left-right, so they don't even know what they're fighting.
[01:18:45.550 --> 01:18:46.270]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.851]  PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:18:54.395 --> 01:18:55.836]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[01:18:55.976 --> 01:18:58.378]  Whether you are aware or not, World War III has started.
[01:18:58.718 --> 01:18:59.599]  Let me rephrase that.
[01:18:59.959 --> 01:19:01.180]  Oil War III has started.
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.921]  Don't kid yourself, the reason we went into Iraq is oil.
[01:19:04.342 --> 01:19:07.744]  Now we are looking at the possibility of invading Iran and even Saudi Arabia.
[01:19:08.164 --> 01:19:12.007]  Why else would the US be building 13 permanent military installations inside Iraq?
[01:19:12.247 --> 01:19:13.528]  Does it look like we're pulling out?
[01:19:13.968 --> 01:19:18.431]  The nations of the earth are consuming oil at the rate of 83 million barrels per day and growing.
[01:19:18.871 --> 01:19:22.854]  At this rate of consumption, experts predict that oil prices will only go up.
[01:19:23.374 --> 01:19:29.276]  Ready Reserves prepared a free booklet explaining the world's oil supply and how it will impact you and how it will change the world forever.
[01:19:29.536 --> 01:19:35.619]  Call Ready Reserves at 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the free booklet and what you can do to prepare.
[01:19:36.159 --> 01:19:36.479]  That's 800-453-2202.
[01:19:36.739 --> 01:19:42.401]  After you read the booklet, you'll understand just how dangerous the world has become.
[01:19:42.842 --> 01:19:43.062]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:19:43.082 --> 01:19:45.463]  Or email your request to ReadyReserves at AOL.com.
[01:19:45.683 --> 01:19:46.003]  That's 800-453-2202.
[01:19:53.422 --> 01:19:57.085]  Have you ever felt like the United States government knows way too much about your financial affairs?
[01:19:57.485 --> 01:20:02.909]  I continue to hear stories about property seizures, frozen bank accounts, confiscation of stocks and bonds.
[01:20:03.390 --> 01:20:04.471]  It makes me wonder if the U.S.
[01:20:04.491 --> 01:20:08.534]  citizen will ever again have the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
[01:20:09.194 --> 01:20:22.481]  Unfortunately, with the Drug and Money Laundering Act, the IRS Revenue Rule in 6045 of 1984, and the Trading with the Enemy Act in Franklin D. Roosevelt's Executive Order of 1933, some precious metal holdings are subject to government intervention.
[01:20:23.001 --> 01:20:28.304]  For this reason, Midas Resources has prepared a report explaining the boundaries of trading precious metals privately.
[01:20:28.604 --> 01:20:34.507]  Whether if you have any intention of trading with Midas Resources or not, I have instructed my representatives to give this report out free.

[01:20:53.962 --> 01:20:55.903]  SuperSilver's combination of supercharged silver and oxygen
[01:21:13.872 --> 01:21:20.738]  has been proven to kill hundreds of bacteria and be at least two to three hundred percent more effective than any other silver product.
[01:21:20.998 --> 01:21:29.585]  SuperSilver is the only patented silver product scientifically proven to kill the germs that cause colds, flu, sinus, ear, eye, and respiratory infections.
[01:21:29.906 --> 01:21:36.211]  It's powerful enough to kill the deadly staph infection, yet completely safe for everyday use by children, adults, and pets.

[01:21:56.647 --> 01:22:05.477]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:22:05.797 --> 01:22:10.483]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:22:10.943 --> 01:22:17.646]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:22:18.046 --> 01:22:29.851]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:22:30.311 --> 01:22:34.773]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[01:22:53.439 --> 01:22:55.640]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.021]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:04.528 --> 01:23:06.790]  Sessions of an economic hitman coming up.
[01:23:07.490 --> 01:23:08.951]  Right now, let's go quickly to calls.
[01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:10.812]  John in California, you're on the air.
[01:23:10.872 --> 01:23:11.292]  Go ahead.
[01:23:12.113 --> 01:23:12.553]  Yes, sir.
[01:23:12.613 --> 01:23:13.054]  Thank you.
[01:23:13.074 --> 01:23:19.638]  I was just rereading 9-11, Descended to Tyranny, which I read cover to cover.
[01:23:21.079 --> 01:23:32.146]  I'm wondering if a person was to become disgusted and or alarmed by the situation in this country and wanted to emigrate, would Canada...
[01:23:32.873 --> 01:23:36.476]  Be a smart choice, or are they just up to the same tricks?
[01:23:37.097 --> 01:23:49.669]  They are up to the exact same things, in some cases worse, in some cases not as bad, with more of a touchy-feely socialist angle to it, but a lot of the programs are the exact same names.
[01:23:50.808 --> 01:23:54.051]  They're signing deals to merge via treaty.
[01:23:54.651 --> 01:24:02.098]  That's what the Pan-American Union, or Free Trade Area of the Americas, is the enacting clause coming up early next year, will do.
[01:24:02.638 --> 01:24:07.462]  And so that's the problem with a new world order, is there's nowhere to run.
[01:24:08.323 --> 01:24:08.783]  Uh-huh.
[01:24:09.464 --> 01:24:13.547]  So a person really wouldn't be any safer, so to speak, at all?
[01:24:14.368 --> 01:24:14.828]  I don't know.
[01:24:14.848 --> 01:24:18.972]  You know, I don't... Just the atmosphere must be cooler, don't you think?
[01:24:20.023 --> 01:24:24.264]  I mean, just that, you know... Maybe for some things, but no, not overall.
[01:24:24.304 --> 01:24:26.785]  They're busy registering and banning guns.
[01:24:26.845 --> 01:24:29.546]  They're busy arresting people for petty reasons.
[01:24:30.126 --> 01:24:33.327]  You'll read a lot of Canadian newspapers bashing our government.
[01:24:33.688 --> 01:24:38.049]  You'll read European papers bashing our government, but you'll see our media bashing them.
[01:24:38.109 --> 01:24:44.951]  It's like they'll tell about the dirt of their brother, but not about their own dirt, and that gives the illusion of a free press.
[01:24:44.971 --> 01:24:47.052]  It's pretty bad in Canada, brother.
[01:24:47.472 --> 01:24:47.572]  Okay.
[01:24:47.612 --> 01:24:47.732]  Uh-huh.
[01:24:47.752 --> 01:24:47.853]  Okay.
[01:24:47.913 --> 01:24:48.213]  Really?
[01:25:06.138 --> 01:25:08.439]  I mean, I'm not trying to burst your bubble there.
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:11.781]  Oh, yes, I just wanted to get some information.
[01:25:11.881 --> 01:25:17.224]  Well, the people are real nice up there, and I'm told the police are a lot nicer in general.
[01:25:17.264 --> 01:25:20.686]  I mean, they're pretty nice folks, kind of old-fashioned.
[01:25:21.866 --> 01:25:27.809]  It's like I was in New Mexico for a week, and the people were a lot nicer than they are in Texas.
[01:25:28.410 --> 01:25:29.410]  I was kind of ashamed.
[01:25:29.450 --> 01:25:30.991]  I thought Texans were supposed to be real nice.
[01:25:31.544 --> 01:25:38.626]  Do you think that Canadians are a little bit behind, haven't quite caught up to the severity of our situation?
[01:25:38.946 --> 01:25:41.626]  As I said, in some cases they're much worse, in some cases they're better.
[01:25:42.407 --> 01:25:42.727]  Okay.
[01:25:43.287 --> 01:25:43.967]  Well, thanks a lot.
[01:25:44.267 --> 01:25:44.787]  Thank you, sir.
[01:25:44.827 --> 01:25:45.687]  I appreciate the call.
[01:25:47.368 --> 01:25:50.228]  Let's go ahead and talk to Paul in Tennessee.
[01:25:50.628 --> 01:25:51.649]  Hello there, Alex.
[01:25:52.009 --> 01:25:52.289]  Hello.
[01:25:52.869 --> 01:25:55.370]  Earth is surely blessed with your existence.
[01:25:55.410 --> 01:25:56.290]  I don't know about that.
[01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.670]  Well, thank you.
[01:25:58.223 --> 01:26:01.965]  I have a number of things I'd like to say.
[01:26:02.385 --> 01:26:12.591]  And I'd just like to start by saying, in the 1960s, Life magazine did a very extensive issue.
[01:26:13.371 --> 01:26:19.554]  I don't remember when in the 60s, but they did this issue on concentration camps.
[01:26:20.495 --> 01:26:24.337]  And at that time, they identified over 200 camps with
[01:26:26.311 --> 01:26:28.192]  Photographs and many, many photographs.
[01:26:28.212 --> 01:26:31.054]  You might be able to find it in the 60s Life magazine.
[01:26:31.114 --> 01:26:34.297]  If you if you look at that, it talked about.
[01:26:34.937 --> 01:26:38.260]  Also, I believe how they began implanting people.
[01:26:39.340 --> 01:26:43.463]  In the 50s, every child that was born in a hospital.
[01:26:44.684 --> 01:26:46.265]  Had a control chip inserted.
[01:26:46.826 --> 01:26:48.867]  This may explain some of the ignorance in the country.
[01:26:48.947 --> 01:26:49.488]  I don't know.
[01:26:49.508 --> 01:26:50.969]  Also.
[01:26:51.129 --> 01:26:51.209]  Uh.
[01:26:57.017 --> 01:27:02.320]  As an aside, nine out of ten people that have died in this planet in war have died in a religious war.
[01:27:05.142 --> 01:27:06.322]  That's an important thing.
[01:27:06.362 --> 01:27:08.163]  Well, let me just take the things you've said.
[01:27:08.183 --> 01:27:09.324]  Here's an example.
[01:27:09.384 --> 01:27:21.251]  I had somebody criticizing me on the web for going, look, he claims concentration camps on his concentration camp page on Infowars.com, but those are training centers in Louisiana.
[01:27:21.835 --> 01:27:22.896]  Well, exactly!
[01:27:23.297 --> 01:27:36.329]  I've got the video in Police State 2000, the government video, where they're openly got foreign troops admittedly training for gun confiscation, and yes, it's, quote, a training center with barbed wire and machine gun nests.
[01:27:36.549 --> 01:27:38.792]  Yeah, they use it as a training center to put us in them.
[01:27:39.132 --> 01:27:41.034]  And then I've got AP Newsmax...
[01:27:42.495 --> 01:27:48.036]  I mean, I had county commissioners on about the camps in Oregon, and it's all over the place.
[01:27:48.076 --> 01:27:51.257]  I mean, Michael Savage calls for putting people in camps every day.
[01:27:52.997 --> 01:27:55.938]  Michelle Malkin put out a book, you know, The Case for Internment.
[01:27:56.518 --> 01:28:02.659]  And these people are just any type of psychological spin to ignore what's happening.
[01:28:02.679 --> 01:28:09.421]  Now, the earliest confirmation of control with wires into the brain I have is in the early 60s.
[01:28:09.441 --> 01:28:09.601]  And...
[01:28:12.398 --> 01:28:24.300]  I have a Time Magazine article where a hospital in the late 90s was trying to implant children with chips, quote, so they wouldn't be lost or stolen or given to the wrong parent.
[01:28:25.461 --> 01:28:26.841]  But now there's no doubt about it.
[01:28:26.941 --> 01:28:28.781]  I mean, now it's happening, Paul.
[01:28:29.782 --> 01:28:30.842]  It happened in the 50s.
[01:28:30.902 --> 01:28:31.802]  I've seen the evidence.
[01:28:31.882 --> 01:28:32.882]  I hope you can find it.
[01:28:32.922 --> 01:28:34.983]  I'm so scattered that I've lost everything.
[01:28:35.003 --> 01:28:38.003]  I don't have time to talk to you today about what's happened to me and the government.
[01:28:38.623 --> 01:28:39.344]  Well, God bless you.
[01:28:39.364 --> 01:28:40.924]  God bless you.
[01:28:43.692 --> 01:28:44.595]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.097 --> 01:28:46.702]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.625 --> 01:28:50.313]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:54.423 --> 01:28:55.904]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:28:56.104 --> 01:29:03.449]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:29:03.749 --> 01:29:08.172]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:29:08.432 --> 01:29:18.278]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:29:19.038 --> 01:29:22.700]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:25.521]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:29:25.821 --> 01:29:31.744]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:29:31.984 --> 01:29:33.624]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:29:33.804 --> 01:29:34.705]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:29:34.805 --> 01:29:37.766]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:29:37.946 --> 01:29:38.846]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:29:38.887 --> 01:29:39.087]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:29:39.107 --> 01:29:40.987]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read
[01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:48.615]  Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:29:48.776 --> 01:29:49.659]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:29:53.658 --> 01:29:55.639]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[01:29:55.719 --> 01:29:56.380]  Hello, folks.
[01:29:56.500 --> 01:30:06.425]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[01:30:06.805 --> 01:30:11.328]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[01:30:11.388 --> 01:30:22.734]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[01:30:23.314 --> 01:30:30.184]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[01:30:30.565 --> 01:30:32.708]  Your purified water is now ready.
[01:30:33.209 --> 01:30:38.176]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[01:30:38.456 --> 01:30:45.222]  Get a set of two for only $49, or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:30:45.422 --> 01:30:49.025]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:30:49.265 --> 01:30:50.066]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:30:54.258 --> 01:30:54.899]  We're good to go.
[01:31:13.442 --> 01:31:13.982]  We're good to go.
[01:31:30.549 --> 01:31:31.530]  That's silverbearcafe.com.
[01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:34.513]  Do it today and preserve this country's greatness for generations to come.
[01:31:58.331 --> 01:32:11.953]  All right, my friends, we're back live.
[01:32:13.413 --> 01:32:16.494]  Coming up here in just a minute or two, we'll be talking to John Perkins.
[01:32:17.434 --> 01:32:19.614]  Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[01:32:20.875 --> 01:32:22.655]  His book has been somewhat of a sensation.
[01:32:23.678 --> 01:32:34.251]  That dovetails with the news that we broke with Greg Pallast three years ago with the IMF World Bank documents and the resignation of Joseph Stiglitz.
[01:32:35.412 --> 01:32:36.834]  So that is coming up.
[01:32:36.854 --> 01:32:39.677]  You want to look inside the mindset of the globalists?
[01:32:40.078 --> 01:32:40.939]  Are they communists?
[01:32:41.039 --> 01:32:41.900]  Are they socialists?
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:42.781]  Are they fascists?
[01:32:43.433 --> 01:32:44.834]  Forget all those terms.
[01:32:44.894 --> 01:32:46.616]  They're command and controllers.
[01:32:47.016 --> 01:32:49.078]  It's an organized crime syndicate.
[01:32:49.618 --> 01:32:54.002]  Again, that's coming up in a few minutes with a real expert and a very brave man who we're honored to have.
[01:32:54.062 --> 01:33:03.990]  Before we go to Mr. Perkins, I want every one of you who's listening to the sound of my voice to please grab a pen and paper.
[01:33:05.351 --> 01:33:09.615]  For another week or so, I'm going to continue the holiday special.
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:16.522]  Of upwards, in some cases more, than 70% off on some of my best videos.
[01:33:18.101 --> 01:33:40.299]  If you buy one copy of American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004, going into how they have the exact same policies, just different rhetoric, going into who controls them, going into the big central banks, going into the Patriot Act 1 and 2, going into Bohemian Grove, going into all of this, you need to have this video. $5.95.
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:51.587]  When you buy one copy for $19.95, each additional copy $5.95 to get four or five copies or more and give them as gifts to friends and family.
[01:33:52.148 --> 01:33:53.989]  These videos are unlocking minds.
[01:33:54.069 --> 01:33:57.372]  I've never seen people more ready to wake up.
[01:33:57.392 --> 01:34:01.876]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, almost three hours long.
[01:34:02.665 --> 01:34:04.767]  Covers the history of government-sponsored terror.
[01:34:05.267 --> 01:34:08.429]  Oklahoma City, the first World Trade Center attack.
[01:34:08.449 --> 01:34:12.932]  9-11 goes into the police state, the cashless society, the national ID cards.
[01:34:13.372 --> 01:34:16.254]  You want an education, and it's riveting, you need to get it.
[01:34:16.415 --> 01:34:20.818]  Each additional copy, $5.95 when you buy one copy at the regular price.
[01:34:22.379 --> 01:34:23.660]  I've got a 9-11 special.
[01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:26.221]  My two 9-11 films, two other great 9-11 films.
[01:34:28.784 --> 01:34:36.789]  And Paul Watson's Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror in the New World Order, his 324-page book.
[01:34:37.170 --> 01:34:44.454]  For $59.95, that, my friends, is a $53 discount.
[01:34:44.915 --> 01:34:46.416]  And there's a bunch of other specials.
[01:34:46.456 --> 01:34:48.177]  They're on Infowars.com.
[01:34:48.417 --> 01:34:50.058]  They're on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:34:50.298 --> 01:34:52.920]  They're in the secure online safe shopping cart.
[01:34:53.060 --> 01:34:54.521]  Order your hard copies today.
[01:34:55.225 --> 01:34:58.867]  We're called toll-free, and if you miss any of the specials, you can call up and ask about them.
[01:34:58.887 --> 01:34:59.528]  1-888-253-3139.

[01:35:01.969 --> 01:35:02.009]  888-253-3139.
[01:35:02.029 --> 01:35:03.090]  Or just write to me.
[01:35:03.110 --> 01:35:04.851]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[01:35:20.467 --> 01:35:42.525]  Or for 15 cents a day, with a monthly or yearly subscription, you can watch all 11 of my films, dozens of other films we've been authorized to post, my weekly TV show that's only available in Austin, now available on the web, my best radio interviews, 15 cents a day if you sign up for a year, 19 cents a day if you sign up for a month, PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:35:42.786 --> 01:35:43.646]  Take advantage of it.
[01:35:43.967 --> 01:35:45.548]  Please take advantage today.
[01:35:46.431 --> 01:35:51.577]  All right, I want to thank John Perkins, author of Confessions of an Economic Hitman, for joining us.
[01:35:52.398 --> 01:35:56.022]  And I've heard him interviewed on Jack Blood's program.
[01:35:56.102 --> 01:35:57.484]  Just an amazing individual.
[01:35:58.205 --> 01:36:01.649]  Everything he was saying is just spot on, and I was learning quite a bit as well.
[01:36:02.731 --> 01:36:19.924]  Despite the fact that I've interviewed scores of economists and people from inside the system, he's one of the highest level defectors to humanity from the forces of tyranny that we've seen in a long, long time since Joseph Stiglitz, Chief Economist of the World Bank.
[01:36:20.724 --> 01:36:25.808]  And John, I really can't do your giant bio justice.
[01:36:27.089 --> 01:36:31.012]  Can you please just, in a nutshell, tell us about yourself?
[01:36:31.821 --> 01:36:37.743]  Well, yeah, I'd be happy to give that a try, Alex, and thank you for inviting me to be on your show.
[01:36:39.563 --> 01:36:42.484]  I was recruited in 1968 while still in business school.
[01:36:42.564 --> 01:36:51.246]  This was my last year in business school in Boston by the National Security Agency, the nation's largest and probably least understood spy organization.
[01:36:51.346 --> 01:36:59.329]  After that, at their encouragement, I spent three years in the Peace Corps in Ecuador working with indigenous people who were opposing oil companies.
[01:36:59.369 --> 01:37:00.889]  It was sort of on-the-job training.
[01:37:01.645 --> 01:37:05.867]  After that, I went to work for a private consulting firm.
[01:37:05.907 --> 01:37:18.592]  The way the National Security Agency works, the way economic hitmen work, is that organizations like the CIA and the National Security Agency identify us.
[01:37:18.632 --> 01:37:23.814]  They put me through a series of very intensive tests, including many hours on a lie detector.
[01:37:25.414 --> 01:37:27.855]  They discovered that we're potential economic hitmen.
[01:37:27.895 --> 01:37:30.136]  They also find a lot of weaknesses in our character.
[01:37:30.683 --> 01:37:37.787]  And I guess I could summarize mine as the big weaknesses of our culture, the three big drugs, which are sex, money, and power.
[01:37:38.747 --> 01:37:46.271]  And then they turn us over to private firms so that there's no direct connection with the government.
[01:37:46.872 --> 01:37:57.097]  So when I came out of the Peace Corps, I went to work for Charles T. May in a consulting firm in Boston, eventually became chief economist for that company with about 50 people working for me.
[01:37:57.798 --> 01:37:59.959]  And that was sort of my cover.
[01:38:00.410 --> 01:38:11.919]  Beneath the surface, I was an economic hitman, and I was trained to do that by an amazing woman named Claudine, who is described in the book, who had access to all my national security agency files, knew all my weaknesses.
[01:38:12.699 --> 01:38:22.367]  Essentially, what economic hitmen do is funnel most of the world's resources into American corporations.
[01:38:22.387 --> 01:38:28.071]  We've basically, in the last 40 years, created the world's first truly global empire.
[01:38:28.999 --> 01:38:30.621]  There's a lot of different ways we do that.
[01:38:30.741 --> 01:38:33.145]  I describe a lot of different examples in the book.
[01:38:33.585 --> 01:38:36.910]  But probably, if there's a typical way, it runs like this.
[01:38:37.531 --> 01:38:41.736]  And that is we identify third world countries that have resources that we covet.
[01:38:41.956 --> 01:38:43.759]  Let's say oil.
[01:38:43.799 --> 01:38:46.803]  And we arrange a deal where that country is going to be lent
[01:38:47.256 --> 01:38:47.877]  Thank you very much.
[01:39:15.877 --> 01:39:20.627]  And the country is then left holding a huge debt that it can't possibly repay.
[01:39:22.364 --> 01:39:26.006]  At some point, we go back to that country and we say, look, you owe us a lot of money.
[01:39:26.046 --> 01:39:27.067]  You can't repay your debt.
[01:39:27.367 --> 01:39:28.167]  Sell us your oil.
[01:39:28.187 --> 01:39:35.072]  Sell our oil companies your oil at a very low price, even if that means destroying your rainforest, your environment, and your indigenous people.
[01:39:35.592 --> 01:39:39.574]  That's pretty much the summary of what economic men do in a nutshell.
[01:39:39.874 --> 01:39:46.919]  Now, Mr. Perkins, from my research and the individuals I've interviewed who've been researching this for the last 60 years...
[01:39:49.168 --> 01:39:56.459]  I would just add one more layer to that, perhaps try to simplify it, and if you disagree with any of it, please tell us how you disagree.
[01:39:56.499 --> 01:39:58.042]  But to boil it down really simply...
[01:39:58.903 --> 01:40:24.658]  In many cases, they just send in the economic hitmen with the IMF or World Bank money or with private money that's going to be paid to private corporations through the IMF or World Bank, hence our tax money, and they tell the dictator, here's five billion bucks, sign over all your water, your oil, your roads, your rights to us, and you don't pay this back as the collateral, and by the way, wink wink, we want you to retire to Switzerland in two years and take half the money with you, that's your payoff for doing that.
[01:40:26.315 --> 01:40:27.556]  Yeah, that happens too, I'm sure.
[01:40:27.576 --> 01:40:30.038]  I was never quite that overt in the work I did.
[01:40:30.078 --> 01:40:32.320]  Mine was a little bit more subtle than that.
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:39.846]  But certainly we know as we move through the system that we're offering huge bribes to the leaders of these countries.
[01:40:39.886 --> 01:40:40.787]  They're very corrupt.
[01:40:40.867 --> 01:40:41.888]  They're very corruptible.
[01:40:42.308 --> 01:40:43.589]  And we set out to corrupt them.
[01:40:44.173 --> 01:40:51.556]  You know, these days we hear about companies like Halliburton with huge overruns in places like Iraq.
[01:40:51.736 --> 01:40:54.437]  And feeding rotten food to the troops in bad water.
[01:40:54.617 --> 01:40:55.077]  Exactly.
[01:40:55.097 --> 01:40:58.519]  And maybe paying a million dollars for $600,000 worth of fuel for their vehicles.
[01:41:01.889 --> 01:41:03.690]  And people wonder, well, where does the other $400,000 go?
[01:41:03.730 --> 01:41:05.770]  Does some individual get wealthy?
[01:41:05.810 --> 01:41:09.292]  Well, no, of course not, and that's not the way Halliburton makes its profit either.
[01:41:09.672 --> 01:41:14.934]  What really happens there is, let's say you're a leader in one of these countries, and I want to bribe you.
[01:41:15.394 --> 01:41:27.658]  Legally, I can't hand you $400,000 under the table, but I can go to a friend of yours, a brother or a business partner who owns the John Deere franchise, and I can say, look, I want to rent at least John Deere equipment from you
[01:41:28.234 --> 01:41:34.318]  And I rent $600,000 worth of John Deere equipment from you, and I pay you a million dollars.
[01:41:34.619 --> 01:41:35.919]  Can I add this, Mr. Perkins?
[01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:42.244]  That's what I've been told by politicians locally in Texas and all over the country, that that's how the payoffs go.
[01:41:42.904 --> 01:41:57.875]  A politician owns a piece of property, or they're told, buy that piece of property for $200,000, and then put an ad up for it for a million, and if you do what we want, we're going to come by and buy that piece of land at your exorbitant price.
[01:41:58.635 --> 01:41:59.516]  I'm sure that happens.
[01:41:59.536 --> 01:42:01.897]  That's exactly how we do business internationally.
[01:42:02.297 --> 01:42:05.478]  Most of these countries bend over backwards not to break the law.
[01:42:06.258 --> 01:42:08.579]  The law against bribing is very strong in the United States.
[01:42:09.060 --> 01:42:11.461]  So they do it in these much more subtle ways.
[01:42:11.701 --> 01:42:24.666]  Another way we used to do it in our Boston office, we had tons of young men, few women but mainly men, who were the sons of important people in countries like Indonesia and Iran and Panama.
[01:42:25.274 --> 01:42:30.057]  And we basically paid for them to come to the United States to go to colleges.
[01:42:30.097 --> 01:42:36.100]  We got them into colleges in Boston, paid all their expenses, and hired them as interns in our corporation.
[01:42:36.120 --> 01:42:38.141]  So just good old-fashioned Mordito.
[01:42:38.662 --> 01:42:40.643]  Exactly, and it's perfectly legal.
[01:42:42.964 --> 01:42:43.685]  Unbelievable.
[01:42:44.525 --> 01:42:45.926]  I've got so many questions for you.
[01:42:45.946 --> 01:42:48.467]  When we start the next hour, I want to take some calls.
[01:42:50.325 --> 01:42:50.505]  I think.
[01:43:07.777 --> 01:43:17.980]  Economic, private industry whistleblowers we talk to is that they'll be in the lunch line at a Midwestern college and suddenly, Hi, I'm David Rockefeller.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:19.681]  I'd like to recruit you for the Peace Corps.
[01:43:20.361 --> 01:43:28.263]  And that you have all this king-making going on and that they do it off the test scores and they do the psychological testing after they do this.
[01:43:28.643 --> 01:43:30.244]  Why do you think they recruit this way?
[01:43:31.903 --> 01:43:32.964]  Well, they have an agenda.
[01:43:33.404 --> 01:43:39.190]  They're watching people all the time, and they've got to get the right people in there.
[01:43:39.210 --> 01:43:46.897]  It was very clearly told to me once I'd been recruited and Claudine started training me.
[01:43:47.537 --> 01:43:52.562]  I was clearly told that, well, first of all, she seduced me into becoming an economic hitman.
[01:43:52.582 --> 01:43:53.983]  She was very, very good at that.
[01:43:54.564 --> 01:43:58.327]  And second of all, she bent over backwards to tell me that it was a dirty business.
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:00.301]  So she was trying to turn you to the dark side.
[01:44:26.064 --> 01:44:26.825]  Well, exactly.
[01:44:26.905 --> 01:44:28.227]  She knew how to hook me.
[01:44:28.287 --> 01:44:29.468]  She knew all my weaknesses.
[01:44:29.508 --> 01:44:35.035]  She knew the things that would appeal to me, and she offered me all of these, the things that I dreamed about all my life, basically.
[01:44:35.396 --> 01:44:37.178]  She was the first of herself, you know?
[01:44:37.888 --> 01:44:55.544]  And then at the same time was telling me, though, that what I'm getting myself into is a pretty dirty business, and I'd better be really willing and ready to... But was the psychological excuse, but they're all dirty too, and somebody's going to run it and rule it, and overall we've got the big global vision, so we might as well be in control.
[01:44:56.225 --> 01:45:02.991]  And it wasn't illegal, you know, it should be, but the scenario I described to you about making these loans to third world countries...
[01:45:03.493 --> 01:45:04.194]  So let's talk about...
[01:45:19.748 --> 01:45:24.691]  Where this money comes from, because a lot of Americans go, good, I'm glad we're taking everybody's stuff.
[01:45:24.791 --> 01:45:25.351]  We need it.
[01:45:25.671 --> 01:45:38.518]  Well, overall, we see the same economic hitman system now being used, phased in here in America, and I want to go through where that money to give to these private corporations from the IMF and World Bank really comes from.
[01:45:38.918 --> 01:45:41.079]  Well, yeah, a lot of it comes from the U.S.
[01:45:41.139 --> 01:45:42.840]  taxpayer.
[01:45:43.080 --> 01:45:44.641]  But I also want to address this, you know,
[01:45:46.264 --> 01:45:49.269]  The attitude of good, you know, let's sort of rip them off sort of thing.
[01:45:49.810 --> 01:45:50.772]  What has happened now
[01:45:51.363 --> 01:45:56.427]  Is we've created a world where 24,000 people starve to death every single day.
[01:45:56.647 --> 01:45:57.548]  Most of them children.
[01:45:58.429 --> 01:45:59.650]  Well, 30,000 children.
[01:45:59.710 --> 01:46:06.075]  In addition to that, 30,000 children die every day of curable diseases because they don't get medicines that are available that they should be getting.
[01:46:06.435 --> 01:46:08.397]  And that's because of our system.
[01:46:08.417 --> 01:46:09.318]  We could change that.
[01:46:09.358 --> 01:46:10.719]  We're the ones who could change that.
[01:46:11.159 --> 01:46:13.461]  There's a lot of very angry people in the world.
[01:46:13.941 --> 01:46:17.124]  Several billion people that, by our measurements, are destitute.
[01:46:17.444 --> 01:46:23.867]  Well, we're living the lifestyle we're living here, and they all know we're living the lifestyle we're living here, and they know that we're ripping their countries off.
[01:46:24.247 --> 01:46:26.929]  We may believe that our foreign aid is altruistic.
[01:46:27.349 --> 01:46:27.769]  It isn't.
[01:46:27.989 --> 01:46:30.631]  But my point is, sir, the party is over.
[01:46:31.031 --> 01:46:34.352]  The globalists are now starting to dismantle this country.
[01:46:34.733 --> 01:46:36.994]  Well, I understand, and that's absolutely true.
[01:46:37.074 --> 01:46:38.254]  I couldn't agree with you more.
[01:46:39.735 --> 01:46:43.637]  Can you elaborate on why they're now turning on the center of their empire?
[01:46:44.255 --> 01:46:47.378]  Well, I think there's a couple of reasons, Alex.
[01:46:47.678 --> 01:46:50.020]  One is that the empire is folding.
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:52.542]  It's in trouble, and they know it's in trouble.
[01:46:53.043 --> 01:46:55.765]  And so, you know, they're pulling in the defenses.
[01:46:55.805 --> 01:46:58.748]  They're climbing behind the walls of the fortress.
[01:46:58.788 --> 01:47:02.431]  They want to accumulate as much for themselves as they can before the whole system falls.
[01:47:02.471 --> 01:47:06.074]  And, of course, they're still hoping it won't fall, but they're seeing that it is falling.
[01:47:06.736 --> 01:47:07.356]  That's one of them.
[01:47:07.596 --> 01:47:09.637]  The other one is that there's no more frontiers.
[01:47:09.677 --> 01:47:10.817]  There's no place else to go.
[01:47:10.877 --> 01:47:12.698]  The markets are drying up around the world.
[01:47:12.918 --> 01:47:14.258]  This is kind of a Ponzi scheme.
[01:47:14.278 --> 01:47:16.419]  They've always got to keep jacking the bubble up.
[01:47:16.659 --> 01:47:17.139]  Exactly.
[01:47:17.179 --> 01:47:20.560]  And throughout history, there's always been frontiers to go to until now.
[01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:22.361]  We've reached every corner of the world.
[01:47:22.401 --> 01:47:25.362]  You know, Nike's selling its products everywhere, and so is Exxon.
[01:47:25.982 --> 01:47:27.643]  And Boeing has sold all the airplanes.
[01:47:27.823 --> 01:47:31.125]  I mean, it can still sell a few more, but it's basically reached everybody.
[01:47:31.705 --> 01:47:33.186]  Kmart's in the same position.
[01:47:33.426 --> 01:47:36.488]  They're all in this position or see it coming very quickly.
[01:47:36.568 --> 01:47:47.994]  Hence the war on terror, creating a new false bipolar world to export what the Pentagon is now calling the new map where they openly admit...
[01:47:48.414 --> 01:47:55.260]  You're probably aware of Professor Barnett's disgusting activities, saying we're going to invade all these countries and we openly work for the globalists.
[01:47:55.300 --> 01:47:56.041]  Ha ha ha!
[01:47:56.741 --> 01:47:56.981]  Yeah.
[01:47:57.602 --> 01:47:59.784]  Yeah, well, that's a big market.
[01:47:59.824 --> 01:48:01.425]  You know, war creates a big market.
[01:48:02.827 --> 01:48:12.755]  And it also, in the case of Iraq, is assuring us, or the idea behind it would be to ensure oil supply and also prop up
[01:48:15.396 --> 01:48:20.779]  The Saudi Arabian government and the Kuwaiti government, both of which are in trouble, especially the Royal House of Saud.
[01:48:21.699 --> 01:48:27.602]  We don't want to lose that part of the world, and we're in grave danger of losing that part of the world because there's so much resentment.
[01:48:27.982 --> 01:48:29.183]  We already lost Iran.
[01:48:30.143 --> 01:48:35.366]  We came very close to losing Iraq and may yet lose Iraq.
[01:48:35.466 --> 01:48:36.746]  I would say we've already lost it.
[01:48:37.347 --> 01:48:44.510]  And the Royal House of Saudi Arabia is teetering on the brink of collapse.
[01:48:45.891 --> 01:49:05.432]  Well, I want to get more into how the economic system, the nuts and bolts, works, but it's more important, I think, to talk about your transformation, because we're seeing a lot of people at every strata of the establishment, public and private, regaining their souls and going public.
[01:49:06.333 --> 01:49:07.494]  And I want to talk about...
[01:49:09.457 --> 01:49:17.741]  Your predictions, do you think we're going to see an acceleration of that as these policies truly show themselves to be how wicked they truly are?
[01:49:17.861 --> 01:49:19.922]  Well, I believe we will, and I certainly hope we will.
[01:49:19.942 --> 01:49:21.783]  And it was one of the objectives for writing the book.
[01:49:21.803 --> 01:49:24.645]  You know, I knew when I wrote this book, I was sticking my head in the noose.
[01:49:25.625 --> 01:49:26.866]  I was breaking an oath.
[01:49:27.286 --> 01:49:28.386]  I'm not suicidal.
[01:49:28.847 --> 01:49:33.429]  So the only reason I did it is because I think it's going to have an important effect and create change.
[01:49:34.338 --> 01:49:41.606]  And I'm hoping that a lot more economic hitmen and other such people will come out of the closet as a result of this and other books that are coming out.
[01:49:41.666 --> 01:49:44.389]  I want to talk about why you turned from the dark side.
[01:49:44.409 --> 01:49:46.992]  When we return, we're talking to John Perkins.
[01:49:47.112 --> 01:49:47.953]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:49:48.394 --> 01:49:49.755]  PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:49:58.157 --> 01:50:02.584]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:50:02.724 --> 01:50:07.130]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:50:07.150 --> 01:50:08.492]  The New World Order.
[01:50:09.233 --> 01:50:10.195]  Can emerge.
[01:50:10.275 --> 01:50:14.500]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:21.508]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:50:21.628 --> 01:50:23.631]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:50:25.492 --> 01:50:34.459]  The new prison economy, the total information society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:50:34.619 --> 01:50:40.023]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[01:52:54.184 --> 01:52:56.924]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:52:56.944 --> 01:53:00.825]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:03.766 --> 01:53:05.446]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:53:06.374 --> 01:53:11.435]  John Perkins' Confessions of an Economic Hitman hit number one on the Amazon charts.
[01:53:11.575 --> 01:53:15.457]  It was even unavailable just a few weeks ago, but it's back in stores right now.
[01:53:15.917 --> 01:53:18.237]  And it's also high on the New York Times bestseller list.
[01:53:18.837 --> 01:53:21.118]  That's got to be infuriating the establishment.
[01:53:21.138 --> 01:53:21.938]  It's an excellent book.
[01:53:22.338 --> 01:53:23.079]  I hope you'll get it.
[01:53:25.129 --> 01:53:44.861]  Joseph Stiklitz, chief economist, World Bank, went public a few years ago, mysteriously thousands of pages of documents, I got many copies of them, right around that time, went public, where they break down how they want to create famine, how they want to break down societies, how they want... Again, the average gullible person, the middle class person, thinks they're part of this establishment.
[01:53:45.181 --> 01:53:49.623]  They think that, oh, they're part of the system, and boy, they're going to be taken care of.
[01:53:50.064 --> 01:53:52.325]  I think they're in for a rude awakening, John, but
[01:53:52.990 --> 01:54:07.073]  But before you comment on that, how long did the process take of you at this very high level, being involved, manipulating whole nations, when did you finally turn the corner?
[01:54:08.450 --> 01:54:13.412]  Well, it happened after I'd been in for about 10 years.
[01:54:13.492 --> 01:54:18.235]  I was made a partner, the youngest partner in the 100-year history of this Boston consulting firm.
[01:54:18.315 --> 01:54:22.677]  I was chief economist and I was on the verge of becoming a millionaire.
[01:54:25.138 --> 01:54:29.700]  My conscience had bothered me throughout the whole time, but I kept justifying myself.
[01:54:29.740 --> 01:54:31.961]  Then one day I was sailing in the Caribbean.
[01:54:34.253 --> 01:54:45.524]  I got off the sailboat and I hiked up a hill and I sat on an old sugar plantation that had been built on the bones of hundreds, maybe thousands of slaves.
[01:54:46.105 --> 01:54:48.327]  As I sat there and thought about how we...
[01:54:49.697 --> 01:54:53.799]  Talk about slavery and those plantations and how we look back and see what an awful thing that was.
[01:54:53.959 --> 01:54:57.921]  I realized that we're doing exactly the same thing around the world.
[01:54:57.961 --> 01:55:00.722]  In fact, I was doing it myself.
[01:55:01.122 --> 01:55:08.805]  The 50 people who worked for me were, in a way, perpetuating this without any of the benefit of being told as I had been by Claudine.
[01:55:08.865 --> 01:55:15.728]  It's all explained in the book, but I seduced them into doing it in different ways, by bonuses and so on, perks and so on and so forth.
[01:55:16.212 --> 01:55:22.534]  So as I sat there on that plantation wall, I realized I just had what you might call an awakening.
[01:55:22.554 --> 01:55:29.475]  I realized I just could not go on with this and that if I continued much longer, I was going to get wealthy.
[01:55:29.495 --> 01:55:31.776]  I was really going to get caught up by the system.
[01:55:31.796 --> 01:55:32.816]  I'd never get out.
[01:55:33.436 --> 01:55:37.977]  So when I went back to Boston a couple of days later, I walked into my boss's office and quit.
[01:55:38.677 --> 01:55:45.659]  However, then I was out without a job and I ended up going back and working for the same company and others as a consultant.
[01:55:46.064 --> 01:55:50.067]  I formed an alternative energy company which built environmentally good power plants.
[01:55:50.087 --> 01:55:51.568]  That assuaged my guilt from.
[01:55:51.989 --> 01:55:59.275]  But the system kept giving me amazing favors, including Congress granted me a special tax exemption that nobody else got.
[01:55:59.755 --> 01:56:02.617]  I kept getting these favors because of the work I'd done previously.
[01:56:03.258 --> 01:56:06.020]  And so I stayed on the peripheries of the system.
[01:56:06.540 --> 01:56:10.443]  I began to write the book several times, including once in the early 90s,
[01:56:11.420 --> 01:56:11.740]  I think so.
[01:56:33.163 --> 01:56:34.284]  But I mustn't write the book.
[01:56:34.724 --> 01:56:35.805]  I accepted the bribe.
[01:56:35.825 --> 01:56:39.006]  I put a lot of that money toward a nonprofit called Dream Change.
[01:56:39.026 --> 01:56:40.827]  You can check it out at dreamchange.org.
[01:56:41.367 --> 01:56:44.249]  It works with indigenous people in many of these countries I've ripped off.
[01:56:44.269 --> 01:56:45.970]  So I did good things with the money.
[01:56:46.090 --> 01:56:50.792]  I assuaged my guilt, but I still really stayed within the peripheries of the system.
[01:56:51.633 --> 01:56:58.216]  And I continued to do that until 1997 when I severed all ties, but still didn't write the book.
[01:56:58.700 --> 01:56:59.060]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:57:18.303 --> 01:57:23.765]  And I realize that my life, the rest of my life, has to be devoted to making this a better world, changing it.
[01:57:24.125 --> 01:57:27.707]  And the first step was to explain what we've done to the American people.
[01:57:28.387 --> 01:57:30.668]  Exactly, because what comes around goes around.
[01:57:30.728 --> 01:57:36.070]  You do reap what you sow, and we cannot engage in these type of activities in a vacuum.
[01:57:36.870 --> 01:57:37.851]  We're all connected.
[01:57:38.331 --> 01:57:40.912]  Third hour coming up with our guest, John Perkins.
[01:57:41.292 --> 01:57:41.712]  Stay with us.
[01:57:50.012 --> 01:57:50.652]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.312 --> 01:57:52.373]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.073 --> 01:57:54.173]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.833 --> 01:57:55.654]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.414 --> 01:57:57.334]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.354 --> 01:58:01.656]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.156 --> 01:58:06.297]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.658 --> 01:58:11.699]  All right, my friends.
[01:58:13.099 --> 01:58:15.300]  All the great stations out there that pick up the broadcast.
[01:58:15.380 --> 01:58:16.560]  I know some of you just joined us.
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:19.441]  Already into the third hour
[01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:27.137]  We're talking to John Perkins, confessions of an economic hitman on many of the bestseller charts.
[01:58:27.298 --> 01:58:29.140]  In fact, number one on quite a few of them.
[01:58:29.801 --> 01:58:31.503]  He joins us for the next 30 minutes.
[01:58:31.523 --> 01:58:32.884]  He's been with us for the last 30.
[01:58:35.086 --> 01:58:42.268]  I know there's a lot of callers who want to talk to Mr. Perkins, and we'll take a question or a comment from those callers coming up in the next segment.
[01:58:42.628 --> 01:58:49.010]  The toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:49.030 --> 01:58:49.370]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:58:49.390 --> 01:58:55.232]  And, of course, my websites are Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:58:55.652 --> 01:58:56.952]  Why do I call it Prison Planet?
[01:58:57.012 --> 01:59:03.054]  Because the globalists don't want any competition to what they're doing, and they're creating a global police state
[01:59:03.726 --> 01:59:10.713]  Well, I was an economic hitman who was very much behind building this empire that you've just described and I finally came clean and wrote the book because I...
[01:59:24.218 --> 01:59:25.079]  Now, in a thumbnail sketch,
[01:59:50.143 --> 01:59:54.404]  This international cartel of private interest, I wouldn't describe them as free market.
[01:59:54.504 --> 02:00:01.925]  I mean, I would describe it as operating like a giant risk game, like they're trying to dominate and control.
[02:00:01.945 --> 02:00:13.247]  I mean, as you said, economic hitman, that this is economic warfare, that this is about consolidation, and that they don't care how many millions starve or who loses their pension or anything.
[02:00:13.627 --> 02:00:14.868]  You're absolutely right.
[02:00:15.128 --> 02:00:16.808]  It's colonialism at its worst.
[02:00:18.086 --> 02:00:20.027]  And it's done extremely subtly.
[02:00:20.067 --> 02:00:25.910]  In the past, empires were built with a combination of commercial interest and the military.
[02:00:25.950 --> 02:00:28.212]  The military basically oversaw everything.
[02:00:28.732 --> 02:00:32.934]  But this empire, since World War II, has been built largely without the military.
[02:00:32.974 --> 02:00:36.356]  The military only comes in as a step of last resort, as in Iraq.
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:41.083]  But most of the empire has been built simply through economic hitmen, through the commercial side.
[02:00:41.504 --> 02:00:42.825]  It's been very, very subtle.
[02:00:43.025 --> 02:00:55.314]  Well, Professor Barnett at the Naval War College openly says that now in the, quote, fourth phase of globalism, the military's going to have to come in and mop up and also fight the mounting resistance to it.
[02:00:55.754 --> 02:01:03.861]  And then he openly said, on C-SPAN in front of all this Pentagon brass, we work for Wall Street, we're building a world government.
[02:01:03.901 --> 02:01:05.662]  Why do you think they're getting so open about it?
[02:01:07.196 --> 02:01:08.917]  Because I think it's becoming very clear.
[02:01:08.977 --> 02:01:12.318]  You mentioned Stiglitz.
[02:01:13.038 --> 02:01:24.561]  Ken Rogoff, who was the chief economist at the World Bank after him, wrote a scathing rebuttal to some of Stiglitz's work after Stiglitz came out with it.
[02:01:25.322 --> 02:01:32.724]  I was on a television show about a month ago with Ken Rogoff, who is now a professor at Harvard and has left the World Bank.
[02:01:33.214 --> 02:01:39.136]  I thought we were going to have a very heated debate, but he didn't debate me.
[02:01:39.176 --> 02:01:41.357]  During a break, I asked him, when is this going to get hot, Ken?
[02:01:41.377 --> 02:01:45.098]  When are you going to start denying or saying what I'm saying isn't true?
[02:01:45.118 --> 02:01:47.199]  He says, I can't say it's not true.
[02:01:47.779 --> 02:01:51.140]  He's now come out in favor of not having the World Bank give loans.
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:54.681]  He's basically turned a big corner himself.
[02:01:55.101 --> 02:01:57.482]  Why are so many people doing that?
[02:01:57.582 --> 02:01:59.943]  I think they're seeing what they've created.
[02:02:00.163 --> 02:02:02.704]  A lot of these people, like me, were
[02:02:03.228 --> 02:02:12.374]  So it's kind of like the emperor's new clothes.
[02:02:12.454 --> 02:02:14.256]  So many people have said, hey, he's naked.
[02:02:14.556 --> 02:02:16.017]  Great, great analogy, yes.
[02:02:18.999 --> 02:02:25.243]  I mean, I would go back to people saying, hey, the world's flat, and you were a kook if you said it was round, and then suddenly one day everybody knew it was round.
[02:02:25.783 --> 02:02:26.344]  Exactly.
[02:02:27.393 --> 02:02:32.379]  But it took a while for them to come out and actually admit it was round, even when they knew it was round, if you know what I mean.
[02:02:32.399 --> 02:02:36.843]  They were still sort of living in the idea of a flat world, even if they knew it was round.
[02:02:36.943 --> 02:02:44.291]  Well, as an economist, I want to get your forecast for the paradigm shift, or will the globalists be able to hold it back with terrorism?
[02:02:45.467 --> 02:02:46.969]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:02:47.169 --> 02:02:50.272]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:02:50.392 --> 02:02:54.296]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:02:54.336 --> 02:02:58.580]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:02.704]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:03:02.844 --> 02:03:04.646]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:03:05.226 --> 02:03:08.148]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[02:03:08.188 --> 02:03:12.892]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:03:13.052 --> 02:03:16.094]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:03:16.274 --> 02:03:19.136]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:03:19.616 --> 02:03:25.741]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:03:26.281 --> 02:03:28.103]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[02:03:44.924 --> 02:03:47.805]  Are terrorist cells or prime terror targets located near you?
[02:03:48.165 --> 02:03:51.026]  Where are military bases and hazardous waste sites located?
[02:03:51.266 --> 02:03:57.468]  How do you find the best area for solar, average rainfall, fish contamination advisories, and major transportation routes?
[02:03:57.828 --> 02:04:05.150]  In the new interactive CD book, Prudent Places USA, you will find the information you want with over 50 interactive parameters that you control.
[02:04:05.330 --> 02:04:09.371]  Find everything from housing prices and taxes to brewing environmental catastrophe.

[02:04:44.324 --> 02:04:47.686]  Heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in America.
[02:04:47.946 --> 02:04:48.266]  Why?
[02:04:48.606 --> 02:04:51.228]  Haven't people heard about the positive effects of cardivite?
[02:04:51.308 --> 02:04:56.251]  Cardivite drops in capsules were designed to improve your cardiovascular health and circulatory well-being.

[02:05:46.312 --> 02:05:48.514]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:49.055 --> 02:05:55.040]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:55.281 --> 02:05:57.803]  I don't come at it from a left or right position.
[02:05:57.963 --> 02:05:58.424]  Sorry.
[02:05:59.324 --> 02:06:00.125]  That's a fraud.
[02:06:01.326 --> 02:06:05.731]  A hundred years ago, they didn't talk about the right or the sinister.
[02:06:06.471 --> 02:06:07.192]  That's the left.
[02:06:08.112 --> 02:06:10.815]  They talked about freedom versus slavery.
[02:06:11.356 --> 02:06:14.340]  And it doesn't matter what big fat politician we're looking at.
[02:06:14.880 --> 02:06:24.912]  In most of the countries of the world, they're bought and paid for by the same interests that are not free market, that are threatened by any independence, threatened by anyone having wealth, isn't controlled by them.
[02:06:26.843 --> 02:06:27.823]  And we've got to stop it.
[02:06:27.843 --> 02:06:31.804]  I know we've got loaded phone lines, Mark and Sherry and Mike and Gene and everybody else.
[02:06:31.824 --> 02:06:33.865]  Your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[02:06:33.885 --> 02:06:42.587]  Later, I'm going to air my little five-minute tribute to the Pulitzer Prize-winning researcher and journalist Gary Webb that GNN TV did.
[02:06:42.627 --> 02:06:44.088]  Just the audio from it, it's excellent.
[02:06:44.448 --> 02:06:49.169]  And also that little news piece about, well, troops obviously dying from depleted uranium.
[02:06:50.171 --> 02:06:51.632]  So that's coming up in the last 30 minutes.
[02:06:52.273 --> 02:06:54.054]  I've got to get this guy back on.
[02:06:54.295 --> 02:06:55.255]  He's just amazing.
[02:06:55.316 --> 02:06:57.117]  Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[02:06:57.137 --> 02:06:58.158]  Here's the book.
[02:06:58.238 --> 02:06:58.959]  You need a copy.
[02:06:58.999 --> 02:07:01.401]  Available where all fine books are sold.
[02:07:01.841 --> 02:07:02.962]  He's John Perkins.
[02:07:03.903 --> 02:07:10.929]  And he's, again, right on the money with my years of research from the outside of this and many of the experts who've been on the inside.
[02:07:12.110 --> 02:07:13.892]  And the way he describes the NSA...
[02:07:14.975 --> 02:07:38.066]  Coming in, out of college, recruiting him, doing the psychological test, then putting him into this investment firm, slowly basting him in the wickedness, seducing him over, then having him go out and seduce a bunch of others, to go around the world and basically bring down these third world economies and consolidate them on loans that were never meant or never designed to be paid back.
[02:07:38.626 --> 02:07:40.787]  And old-fashioned slavery, John...
[02:07:42.336 --> 02:07:44.678]  Old-fashioned slavery, they had to at least feed the slaves.
[02:07:44.698 --> 02:07:52.044]  With this new system, it seems like they don't even care about the population as long as they've got control of all the resources, and they'll just get the resources.
[02:07:52.084 --> 02:07:59.510]  In the case of Argentina, turn the water off, turn the fuel off, triple the prices, until the middle class is literally out.
[02:08:00.110 --> 02:08:11.239]  There was one article in the Washington Post where a cattle trailer jumped over, and formerly middle-class families were running up, slashing off pieces of raw beef, gobbling it.
[02:08:11.979 --> 02:08:13.301]  I mean, that's how bad this gets.
[02:08:13.681 --> 02:08:17.524]  Yeah, well, as I said earlier, 24,000 people starve to death every single day.
[02:08:18.745 --> 02:08:20.887]  And yeah, it's real slavery.
[02:08:20.927 --> 02:08:22.008]  There's no question about it.
[02:08:22.308 --> 02:08:24.770]  And it's being done extremely subtly.
[02:08:25.391 --> 02:08:31.336]  In the old days, you know, we knew that the armies were going out and conquering other countries.
[02:08:31.903 --> 02:08:33.344]  I hear that a lot today about the Arabs.
[02:08:33.364 --> 02:08:33.664]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:08:52.681 --> 02:08:55.042]  And yet today it's so much more subtle.
[02:08:55.082 --> 02:08:58.404]  We're not aware because it's not physical in that way.
[02:08:58.424 --> 02:09:03.708]  It's being done through the economic system rather than through armies and chains and swords for the most part.
[02:09:03.748 --> 02:09:06.930]  The military, the violence only comes in as a last resort.
[02:09:06.950 --> 02:09:07.911]  As I describe in the book,
[02:09:08.331 --> 02:09:13.333]  When economic hitmen fail, the next step is the CIA-sanctioned jackals.
[02:09:13.533 --> 02:09:22.716]  Now, that's a key point, because we really see them being employed and out in the open for the first time in Iraq with these private hit teams and private torture squads.
[02:09:22.756 --> 02:09:23.476]  Tell us about that.
[02:09:23.856 --> 02:09:26.617]  Well, the jackals have been around for a long time.
[02:09:26.637 --> 02:09:31.899]  When I failed as an economic hitman in Panama, they assassinated Omar Torrijos.
[02:09:33.040 --> 02:09:34.561]  Yes, there's a lot of them in Iraq.
[02:09:34.701 --> 02:09:39.382]  I have a very good friend who's been in Jekyll for a long time who's over there right now making a great deal of money.
[02:09:40.162 --> 02:09:43.043]  These people are not on any list of military.
[02:09:43.063 --> 02:09:47.865]  They work for firms that are often offshore firms.
[02:09:48.265 --> 02:09:49.305]  They don't pay taxes.
[02:09:49.685 --> 02:09:57.688]  And they do the things that our military is prohibited under law from doing, such as torture, such as assassination, such as murder.
[02:09:58.368 --> 02:09:59.468]  This goes on all the time.
[02:09:59.709 --> 02:10:01.029]  Americans need to know about this.
[02:10:02.347 --> 02:10:08.592]  Just a few weeks ago I saw a mainstream article out of Argentina where different U.S.
[02:10:08.612 --> 02:10:16.518]  corporations or offshore corporations are hiring hundreds of the former leaders of Latin American death squads to actually take them to Iraq.
[02:10:17.768 --> 02:10:20.349]  Yeah, they've been recruiting, and I've been reading that too.
[02:10:20.409 --> 02:10:33.455]  I don't have any inside information, but I've seen this in the press where they've been recruiting people from Chile, Argentina, and several other South American countries who worked under right-wing dictators in the past and now are being recruited to go into Iraq.
[02:10:35.376 --> 02:10:41.999]  Some people say, well, good, these people are evil terrorists, but the worst Islamic regimes, our government props them up.
[02:10:43.236 --> 02:10:45.558]  And then just goes after the weak countries.
[02:10:46.038 --> 02:10:58.447]  It's a shame that our government lies to us so profusely, telling us that they're doing things in the name of democracy throughout Saddam Hussein, and they want to have these upcoming elections in the name of democracy.
[02:10:58.727 --> 02:11:05.412]  At the same time, they instigated a coup against the democratically elected president, Hugo Chavez, in Venezuela.
[02:11:05.931 --> 02:11:09.874]  We threw out the democratically elected president of Iran back in the 50s.
[02:11:10.494 --> 02:11:13.416]  We threw out the democratically elected president of Chile.
[02:11:13.556 --> 02:11:21.882]  I want to stop you right there, because people probably don't know this, but I heard the grandson of FDR who ran the operation, what, in 53 in Iran.
[02:11:21.942 --> 02:11:27.886]  He was anti-communist, pro-West, and here are the criminals bragging on NPR.
[02:11:27.906 --> 02:11:29.607]  They're very proud of themselves.
[02:11:30.493 --> 02:11:48.942]  And he just wanted 30% of the oil money for the people, and so they hired thousands of thugs to shoot and bomb, and then blamed it on him, and then they were admitting they did this, carried out terror attacks, blamed it on him, and then put the princeling, the shah in, who set up all the torture chambers and the rest of it.
[02:11:49.242 --> 02:11:54.305]  One of those torturers was, of course, Chalibi, who they tried to have be the head guy of Iraq.
[02:11:54.765 --> 02:11:55.647]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:11:55.667 --> 02:12:00.376]  So it's not like it was some evil commie or some excuse to go into Iran.
[02:12:01.018 --> 02:12:02.100]  This was a good guy.
[02:12:02.460 --> 02:12:03.322]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:12:03.382 --> 02:12:05.566]  It had been Time Magazine's Man of the Year.
[02:12:07.450 --> 02:12:19.360]  He was being held up as a great example of how democracy was going to be pervasive in the Middle East and much of the world in 1951, when most of the day, you're talking about, was elected.
[02:12:19.740 --> 02:12:27.547]  But then he turned against the oil companies and said, at that point the oil companies were taking about 85% of all the oil money out of Iran.
[02:12:27.587 --> 02:12:28.728]  And he said, that's not fair.
[02:12:29.308 --> 02:12:32.491]  Our country deserves more of this money from our own resources.
[02:12:33.675 --> 02:12:37.317]  So he was demanding that they pay more or threatening to nationalize them.
[02:12:37.617 --> 02:12:38.897]  But what's the policy?
[02:12:38.917 --> 02:12:43.559]  I mean, it's not just turning a corner and people being good guys going public with this.
[02:12:43.860 --> 02:12:45.420]  That's not what Barnett and others are doing.
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:59.026]  I literally heard in a two-part series on NPR a few months ago where they came out and bragged about it like they were good and admitted that our government murdered people and blamed it on Mosaday.
[02:13:00.310 --> 02:13:00.650]  Really?
[02:13:00.690 --> 02:13:01.811]  Who admitted that?
[02:13:02.532 --> 02:13:07.055]  It was an interview with FDR's grandson who ran the operation.
[02:13:07.275 --> 02:13:08.356]  Kermit Roosevelt.
[02:13:08.516 --> 02:13:10.317]  Actually, Teddy Roosevelt's grandson, yes.
[02:13:10.377 --> 02:13:11.458]  Excuse me, I apologize.
[02:13:11.478 --> 02:13:12.259]  You're right.
[02:13:12.839 --> 02:13:15.781]  Yeah, it was Kermit Roosevelt and two other guys.
[02:13:15.801 --> 02:13:23.807]  I'm sorry you didn't hear that, but I was literally sitting in my car outside Home Depot listening to the 15-minute piece.
[02:13:23.867 --> 02:13:27.510]  Next time I heard the second part, why on earth would they be just bragging about it?
[02:13:27.870 --> 02:13:28.531]  I can't imagine.
[02:13:29.713 --> 02:13:30.573]  I really can't.
[02:13:31.754 --> 02:13:32.734]  It might have been an old interview.
[02:13:32.754 --> 02:13:33.515]  He might even be dead.
[02:13:33.535 --> 02:13:34.075]  I don't know.
[02:13:34.195 --> 02:13:35.615]  I think Kermit Roosevelt died in 2000.
[02:13:35.735 --> 02:13:39.577]  I was going to say that, but I don't have that information in front of me.
[02:13:39.777 --> 02:13:40.717]  That's my recollection.
[02:13:40.737 --> 02:13:47.140]  So it might have been an old interview, but I still can't imagine why he would have admitted to that.
[02:13:48.641 --> 02:13:49.341]  It blew me away.
[02:13:49.381 --> 02:13:51.142]  I mean, I had read that and knew that, but...
[02:13:52.626 --> 02:13:53.607]  Well, you know, it's interesting.
[02:13:54.047 --> 02:14:11.640]  Since I wrote the book, one of the key characters in the book, the man who recruited me for Charles T. May and Ina Greve, who I talk about in the book, has contacted me, written me an amazing letter where he's admitted to a great many things, too, and says that the things I say in the book are true.
[02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:13.401]  He's substantially what I said.
[02:14:13.900 --> 02:14:20.802]  And in his letters he's told me an awful lot more about things that he did in Asia and so on in connection with the CIA.
[02:14:21.582 --> 02:14:27.063]  And I'm very shocked that he wrote the letter and at the end he said he was thinking of writing a book, which I'm very much encouraging him to do.
[02:14:28.104 --> 02:14:33.145]  It is possible that even people like Kermit Roosevelt have had a catharsis that they wanted to confess.
[02:14:34.345 --> 02:14:37.686]  And I think that that's a very important part of this process.
[02:14:38.346 --> 02:14:42.087]  If people like Kermit and like Ina Greave and like me and others
[02:14:43.041 --> 02:14:44.382]  And really start talking about this.
[02:14:44.482 --> 02:14:49.105]  And at the same time, you get people like Stiglitz and Rogoff speaking out against the system.
[02:14:49.125 --> 02:14:49.825]  Things will change.
[02:14:51.006 --> 02:14:52.427]  Well, exactly.
[02:14:52.447 --> 02:14:54.128]  And I want to start taking some calls.
[02:14:54.248 --> 02:15:00.412]  But a point I wanted to add to that is we interviewed Charlotte Iserby, who was the number two in the Department of Education for Reagan.
[02:15:00.652 --> 02:15:02.193]  Her father was skull and bones.
[02:15:03.533 --> 02:15:05.275]  And was a Bohemian Grove member.
[02:15:05.415 --> 02:15:07.516]  And she talked about his deathbed experience.
[02:15:07.876 --> 02:15:08.516]  Well, exactly.
[02:15:08.536 --> 02:15:09.957]  I'm glad I did it when I did.
[02:15:09.977 --> 02:15:12.858]  Hopefully I've got a lot more years left in me to write more.
[02:15:13.038 --> 02:15:13.078]  Um...
[02:15:34.538 --> 02:15:38.739]  I haven't been overtly threatened at this point in time, but I've been, let's say, harassed.
[02:15:38.799 --> 02:15:40.160]  I'm sure my phones are tapped.
[02:15:40.580 --> 02:15:47.882]  Every time I go to an airport security check, I get pulled aside and frisked and go through the whole check, at least most every time these days.
[02:15:47.902 --> 02:15:49.703]  They put you on that watch list, yeah.
[02:15:50.399 --> 02:15:54.441]  Well, why don't we just say hi to the people listening, or the folks that listen to the computer tapes later.
[02:15:55.321 --> 02:15:58.903]  Do you like the death of 30,000 children a day on your hands?
[02:15:59.644 --> 02:16:01.725]  Do you like that, whoever's listening?
[02:16:01.925 --> 02:16:03.125]  Because you are part of that.
[02:16:03.706 --> 02:16:07.087]  And so, you just better wake up.
[02:16:07.668 --> 02:16:09.268]  Let's talk to Mark in Wyoming.
[02:16:09.328 --> 02:16:10.169]  Mark, you're on the air.
[02:16:10.209 --> 02:16:10.649]  Go ahead.
[02:16:11.229 --> 02:16:11.990]  Hey, Alex.
[02:16:12.090 --> 02:16:13.470]  I want to thank you for taking my call.
[02:16:14.071 --> 02:16:14.391]  Welcome.
[02:16:15.185 --> 02:16:17.527]  I really think a lot of you, and I appreciate John.
[02:16:17.547 --> 02:16:21.449]  It's a big move for him, I'm sure, and a big gain for us.
[02:16:22.230 --> 02:16:25.692]  But I've got two comments I'd like to make, and I'll take your comments off the air.
[02:16:26.072 --> 02:16:26.973]  Go ahead.
[02:16:27.993 --> 02:16:33.917]  Are you aware that the banks are loaning credit, which is illegal?
[02:16:34.998 --> 02:16:39.601]  And there's lots of people out there who've got credit cards, bank loans, student loans, and so forth.
[02:16:40.205 --> 02:16:47.888]  And they can stop that collection process by applying the Fair Debt Credit Practices Act, which requires the bank to show them where the money comes from.
[02:16:48.088 --> 02:16:57.011]  What you're saying is true in many cases, but to talk to our guest about that, yeah, the banks aren't even loaning real money.
[02:16:57.051 --> 02:17:02.312]  They're loaning credit with zeros and ones, and now in a lot of lawsuits that's being overturned.
[02:17:02.332 --> 02:17:03.313]  Were you aware of that, John?
[02:17:04.133 --> 02:17:04.693]  No, I wasn't.
[02:17:07.134 --> 02:17:09.475]  It's just all part of this leveraging process.
[02:17:11.184 --> 02:17:11.504]  Yeah.
[02:17:12.164 --> 02:17:14.245]  It's something that I haven't been involved in personally.
[02:17:14.545 --> 02:17:15.405]  Anything else, Mark?
[02:17:17.106 --> 02:17:17.726]  Okay, he's gone.
[02:17:17.746 --> 02:17:22.848]  We'll come back and talk to Sherry, Mike, Gene, and others for our guest.
[02:17:22.888 --> 02:17:24.008]  An incredible interview.
[02:17:24.068 --> 02:17:29.690]  I appreciate him joining us and answering all of our questions.
[02:17:29.930 --> 02:17:31.351]  Just a real gentleman.
[02:17:31.631 --> 02:17:39.834]  We'll come back and continue speaking with our guest, the book, Confessions of an Economic Hitman in Bookstores, right now.

[02:18:39.995 --> 02:18:41.016]  The real money folks.
[02:18:54.232 --> 02:18:57.553]  Let's review a few things from the past year, November 2003 to November 2004.
[02:18:57.593 --> 02:18:59.574]  The dollars ranged from $9,800 to $10,300, a 5% increase.
[02:19:00.154 --> 02:19:05.775]  The dollar's value has dropped from $0.96 to $0.70 against the euro, a 24% decrease in spending power against the gold-backed euro.
[02:19:15.484 --> 02:19:21.108]  Gold has gone from the 390s to the 440s, a 16% increase in real money.
[02:19:21.729 --> 02:19:24.751]  Precious metals are the safe haven in today's hectic marketplace.

[02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:57.351]  Keith in Ohio.
[02:20:57.411 --> 02:21:04.112]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:21:04.552 --> 02:21:10.697]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:21:10.837 --> 02:21:12.098]  There are no side effects.
[02:21:12.418 --> 02:21:15.381]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:21:15.521 --> 02:21:16.421]  Eliminate the cost.
[02:21:16.501 --> 02:21:17.562]  Don't just treat symptoms.
[02:21:17.822 --> 02:21:25.108]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:21:25.388 --> 02:21:28.791]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[02:21:29.191 --> 02:21:32.334]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[02:21:32.354 --> 02:21:32.614]  866-885-6625.
[02:21:32.634 --> 02:21:32.674]  866-885-6625.
[02:21:32.694 --> 02:21:33.534]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[02:21:33.594 --> 02:21:33.895]  Call today.
[02:21:33.955 --> 02:21:35.396]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:21:35.416 --> 02:21:37.157]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:21:56.776 --> 02:22:12.481]  All right, we're going to have our guest until about 40 after this little segment, a little bit into the next segment, then I'm going to play that tribute to Gary Webb that GNN TV did, Grella News Network, and also that Kansas City news piece about depleted uranium deaths.
[02:22:13.481 --> 02:22:14.521]  Let's go through the calls.
[02:22:14.921 --> 02:22:18.542]  Sherry in Oregon, you're on the air with our guest.
[02:22:18.962 --> 02:22:19.422]  Go ahead.
[02:22:20.143 --> 02:22:24.644]  Hi, Alex, and hello, Mr. Perkins, and congratulations on regaining your integrity.
[02:22:25.607 --> 02:22:29.430]  My call isn't specifically to Mr. Perkins, but it's kind of overall.
[02:22:29.490 --> 02:22:30.531]  It's about enslavement.
[02:22:31.432 --> 02:22:34.414]  And I'm a Canadian citizen living here in America.
[02:22:35.134 --> 02:22:36.936]  And I came here because of the Constitution.
[02:22:37.456 --> 02:22:41.599]  And I just want to make a few points about Canada and going to Canada and living there.
[02:22:42.220 --> 02:22:44.421]  First off, you have a 50% sales tax.
[02:22:45.202 --> 02:22:50.446]  If you make over and above $56,000, you're paying basically 60% of your income to the government.
[02:22:51.232 --> 02:22:53.373]  Cost of living is very expensive.
[02:22:53.713 --> 02:22:56.495]  A pair of shoes and pants will cost you almost $200.
[02:22:56.535 --> 02:22:59.576]  They're an insurance corporation.
[02:22:59.696 --> 02:23:00.897]  Everything is tied in.
[02:23:00.917 --> 02:23:05.039]  So if you make an error anywhere, if you have a speeding ticket, you won't be able to insure your car.
[02:23:05.059 --> 02:23:05.919]  You won't register it.
[02:23:06.260 --> 02:23:07.300]  You won't be able to drive.
[02:23:08.701 --> 02:23:14.344]  The reason she's saying this is a caller before you came on, Mr. Perkins, was saying, should I run to Canada?
[02:23:14.444 --> 02:23:15.404]  And that's the problem.
[02:23:16.125 --> 02:23:18.826]  This is really a global system, is it not?
[02:23:18.846 --> 02:23:20.447]  Yes, it is.
[02:23:21.912 --> 02:23:22.433]  Exactly.
[02:23:22.773 --> 02:23:30.019]  Your comments on the whole Patriot Act and the National ID Card, all of this police state stuff that's being put in place here, why do you think they're doing that, John?
[02:23:31.640 --> 02:23:37.344]  Well, it's all part of this empire building, the thing that you've been talking about, what you're calling globalization.
[02:23:37.404 --> 02:23:45.291]  It's an attempt to really create a huge empire that's under the control of a very few people.
[02:23:45.731 --> 02:23:48.153]  And it's something that we just can't let happen.
[02:23:48.743 --> 02:23:48.923]  Yep.
[02:23:49.104 --> 02:23:49.985]  Anything else, Sherry?
[02:23:50.145 --> 02:23:52.347]  You can't run away from it, incidentally.
[02:23:52.387 --> 02:23:54.930]  Running to Canada or running anywhere else is not the solution.
[02:23:54.990 --> 02:24:03.400]  The solution is to face it head-on, even as our ancestors did back in the 1770s when England was doing something very similar.
[02:24:04.159 --> 02:24:06.221]  Yeah, that was the form of mercantilism.
[02:24:06.261 --> 02:24:08.242]  And I was going to say, isn't this really mercantilism?
[02:24:08.302 --> 02:24:13.446]  It looks like free market, but it's only special licensees working under the crown.
[02:24:13.486 --> 02:24:16.448]  And the crown today are these top ten global corporations.
[02:24:16.708 --> 02:24:18.270]  Absolutely, it's mercantilism.
[02:24:18.830 --> 02:24:23.453]  And it's just a much subtler and a much more effective form than the British ever thought about.
[02:24:23.473 --> 02:24:26.115]  And it's time that we stood and fought this system.
[02:24:26.155 --> 02:24:27.136]  We can't run away from it.
[02:24:27.697 --> 02:24:28.717]  Thank you for bringing that up here.
[02:24:28.737 --> 02:24:29.798]  Yeah, Sherry, thanks for the call.
[02:24:29.898 --> 02:24:31.019]  I've got to let you go.
[02:24:31.039 --> 02:24:31.760]  I've got a lot of callers.
[02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:32.700]  Mike in Arizona.
[02:24:32.740 --> 02:24:33.361]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:24:34.301 --> 02:24:34.961]  Hello, it's Keith.
[02:24:35.601 --> 02:24:38.122]  Okay, Keith from Ohio.
[02:24:38.162 --> 02:24:38.622]  Go ahead.
[02:24:38.802 --> 02:24:46.403]  Yes, I just started listening to you recently, and I've been praying for you there and so forth that the Lord will strengthen you to expose this evil.
[02:24:46.423 --> 02:24:47.043]  Thank you.
[02:24:47.263 --> 02:24:50.284]  And make sure you stay in the God's Word, you know, and put Him first and so forth.
[02:24:51.444 --> 02:25:01.006]  You know, America has done a lot of good around the world, and of course we've been drifting the last 50 or more years away from God and away from His Word.
[02:25:02.189 --> 02:25:02.950]  No, I agree with you.
[02:25:03.030 --> 02:25:06.051]  We're not very Christian in our actions.
[02:25:06.071 --> 02:25:06.872]  We talk the talk.
[02:25:06.912 --> 02:25:07.772]  We don't walk the walk.
[02:25:07.792 --> 02:25:10.114]  Let me get a comment from our guest, John.
[02:25:10.134 --> 02:25:11.094]  No, I agree with you completely.
[02:25:11.114 --> 02:25:13.196]  America has done a great deal of good around the world.
[02:25:13.216 --> 02:25:15.117]  We still do good around the world.
[02:25:31.582 --> 02:25:38.944]  But we're becoming worse and worse and doing less and less good and more and more bad, and we need to turn that around.
[02:25:38.964 --> 02:25:40.705]  We need to go back to our true roots.
[02:25:40.765 --> 02:25:53.708]  I'm a deep conservative in that I want to really see this country follow the principles as outlined in our Constitution, which Sherry mentioned earlier, and in our Declaration of Independence to really go to our deepest values of equality and justice for all.
[02:25:54.748 --> 02:25:56.869]  My main comment I was leading to was...
[02:25:58.055 --> 02:26:15.206]  That just like everything we have has really been a gift or a grace of the Lord, even the ability to work or to breathe air, I think he's taking our wealth and taking it away from us and out of our hands and even sending other people, just like he's done with ancient Israel when they went away from God.
[02:26:15.847 --> 02:26:24.072]  So we need to get back to the... Well, when you become decadent and corrupt, you get enslaved because it takes values to have courage.
[02:26:24.092 --> 02:26:24.753]  Thanks for the call.
[02:26:25.693 --> 02:26:26.814]  You've got really great points.
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:29.941]  Mike in Arizona will hold you over if need be.
[02:26:29.981 --> 02:26:30.621]  Mike, go ahead.
[02:26:31.342 --> 02:26:37.405]  Yes, Mr. Perkins, you mentioned early on that you felt like you were working on behalf of American corporations.
[02:26:39.546 --> 02:26:45.448]  Do you really feel like these corporations have any sense of American identity, American citizenship?
[02:26:46.909 --> 02:26:55.053]  Well, you know, corporation is really the people in it, and the people at the top of the corporation will is the good point that you bring up, Mike, because the people at the top of the corporation...
[02:26:55.632 --> 02:26:59.402]  We'll use the laws of whatever land works best for them, and they'll go to that land.
[02:26:59.924 --> 02:27:03.193]  I would point out that of the 100 largest economies in the world...
[02:27:04.075 --> 02:27:06.096]  52 of these are corporations, not government.
[02:27:06.496 --> 02:27:08.817]  And out of those 52, 47 are U.S.
[02:27:08.857 --> 02:27:09.577]  corporations.
[02:27:10.058 --> 02:27:11.338]  So it is very much a U.S.
[02:27:11.418 --> 02:27:12.379]  corporate-driven thing.
[02:27:12.419 --> 02:27:13.499]  We're like the quarterback.
[02:27:13.519 --> 02:27:15.420]  There's others involved, but we're like the quarterback.
[02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:16.700]  But you're absolutely right.
[02:27:16.720 --> 02:27:21.983]  These corporations incorporate in many different countries and go to whichever one serves their interests the best.
[02:27:22.263 --> 02:27:22.863]  Stay there, Michael.
[02:27:22.883 --> 02:27:26.885]  I'll let you finish up in the final segment with our guest on the other side of this quick break.
[02:27:27.265 --> 02:27:29.366]  Infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv.
[02:27:29.486 --> 02:27:29.886]  Stay with us.
[02:27:36.023 --> 02:27:36.924]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.425 --> 02:27:39.028]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.950 --> 02:27:42.654]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:46.641 --> 02:27:48.122]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[02:27:48.323 --> 02:27:55.669]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:27:55.969 --> 02:28:00.393]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:28:00.673 --> 02:28:10.502]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:28:10.862 --> 02:28:12.863]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read
[02:28:39.480 --> 02:28:40.831]  Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[02:28:40.993 --> 02:28:41.900]  It's powerful stuff.
[02:28:46.064 --> 02:28:47.665]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:28:47.805 --> 02:28:51.906]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[02:28:52.046 --> 02:28:54.928]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[02:28:55.008 --> 02:29:01.730]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[02:29:01.910 --> 02:29:04.912]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[02:29:05.112 --> 02:29:07.513]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[02:29:07.633 --> 02:29:15.896]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites, but also remove trihalomethanes and volatile organic elements such as after
[02:29:15.896 --> 02:29:17.417]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[02:29:45.564 --> 02:29:49.249]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its Bubble Up Technology.
[02:29:49.530 --> 02:29:53.836]  But have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses Bubble Up Technology?
[02:29:54.076 --> 02:30:01.006]  BioOx Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[02:30:01.386 --> 02:30:08.029]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds, your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[02:30:08.349 --> 02:30:11.830]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioWalk Citrus Concentrate.
[02:30:11.970 --> 02:30:13.231]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioWalk.com.
[02:30:16.932 --> 02:30:24.074]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason BioOx International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[02:30:24.154 --> 02:30:30.856]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use BioOx Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[02:30:31.036 --> 02:30:35.717]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[02:30:35.917 --> 02:30:38.438]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[02:30:38.598 --> 02:30:43.259]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use BioOx family of products.
[02:30:53.777 --> 02:30:55.198]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:30:55.298 --> 02:30:56.539]  until 2 p.m.
[02:30:56.579 --> 02:30:59.620]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight Central.
[02:31:00.060 --> 02:31:01.261]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:31:01.481 --> 02:31:02.182]  I love freedom.
[02:31:02.502 --> 02:31:03.743]  I hate bullies and tyranny.
[02:31:04.523 --> 02:31:08.005]  And I know that the global crime syndicate known as the New World Order...
[02:31:09.622 --> 02:31:15.927]  It wants total control, total consolidation, and is setting up a police state here domestically, as well as worldwide.
[02:31:16.107 --> 02:31:17.928]  It must be resisted.
[02:31:18.409 --> 02:31:23.893]  You must stand against it and get out of your denial and realize how you're compartmentalized.
[02:31:25.066 --> 02:31:28.409]  And how you're being used as a piston in this machine.
[02:31:29.009 --> 02:31:33.953]  Somebody who's done that and gone public is our guest, John Perkins, Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[02:31:34.253 --> 02:31:43.760]  I've got a few final questions for him about his best-selling book and the great work he's now doing, but I wanted to let Mike in Arizona as our tail gunner be our last caller.
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:45.221]  Finish up what you were saying, Mike.
[02:31:45.761 --> 02:31:46.642]  Yeah, thanks, Alex.
[02:31:47.223 --> 02:31:54.428]  One of the questions, is it your sense that big private investment bankers, probably some names that we've never even heard of,
[02:31:55.199 --> 02:32:01.305]  Who sit on the boards of these corporations are really kind of at the top of the heap, this criminal syndicate?
[02:32:01.886 --> 02:32:02.126]  Yes.
[02:32:02.646 --> 02:32:12.096]  Well, I describe in the book what I call a corporatocracy, which is those big bankers you mentioned, also the heads of big corporations and government.
[02:32:12.216 --> 02:32:16.160]  And these people tend to move back and forth between those jobs, as we all know.
[02:32:17.117 --> 02:32:19.219]  Robert McNamara was a great example.
[02:32:19.459 --> 02:32:24.002]  President of Ford and then Secretary of Defense under Kennedy and Johnson.
[02:32:24.082 --> 02:32:26.884]  What about somebody like Michelle or Wolfensohn?
[02:32:28.745 --> 02:32:36.610]  Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank today, comes out of the investment community, international investment community.
[02:32:36.630 --> 02:32:38.552]  Yeah, he could be classified in that.
[02:32:38.612 --> 02:32:46.037]  I think Wolfensohn's actually got some extremely good ideas, and I wish he'd have a little bit more success in some of the stuff he does.
[02:32:47.711 --> 02:32:55.356]  But any number of these people, you know, Cheney's a great example, but every administration has had their examples.
[02:32:55.396 --> 02:33:07.405]  George Shultz was a great example, President of Bechtel, and then... Should we take it serious that he's openly pushing Schwarzenegger for president and that he's trying to get the Constitution amended?
[02:33:07.445 --> 02:33:12.149]  I mean, when a kingmaker like Shultz is spending all his time with Schwarzenegger, is that a problem?
[02:33:12.848 --> 02:33:14.489]  Of course it's a problem.
[02:33:14.949 --> 02:33:17.771]  He is a kingmaker, as you describe it, as is Dick Cheney.
[02:33:18.491 --> 02:33:33.799]  And there's a lot of evidence that shows that some of these people actually selected Carter because they knew that after what Nixon went through with Watergate, that Ford would not be re-elected and no Republican would, so they wanted a very benign Democrat.
[02:33:34.579 --> 02:33:40.522]  I think that these kingmakers have a big effect on both parties in a very significant way.
[02:33:41.812 --> 02:33:53.903]  Well, I hope folks take it serious, because the Kennedy biographer is coming out with an authorized book with Schwarzenegger's, quote, plan for the presidency, and they want to use him as an archetypal war king for this empire.
[02:33:54.924 --> 02:33:56.645]  Very interesting.
[02:33:56.865 --> 02:33:58.487]  It sounds crazy, but they're really doing it.
[02:33:59.448 --> 02:34:00.208]  Anything else, Mike?
[02:34:00.809 --> 02:34:02.050]  Yeah, one other thing, Mr. Perkins.
[02:34:02.330 --> 02:34:04.632]  You said that 9-11 was a turning point for you.
[02:34:05.973 --> 02:34:07.214]  What, in your opinion, happened on 9-1-1?
[02:34:09.580 --> 02:34:15.811]  Well, I don't have any inside information about that, and I really hate to speculate on things that I don't know about.
[02:34:15.831 --> 02:34:20.860]  I tried in the book to only write about things that I'm 100% sure of, that I experienced myself.
[02:34:21.101 --> 02:34:21.602]  Sure, I appreciate it.
[02:34:21.622 --> 02:34:22.744]  And can back up with other facts.
[02:34:23.331 --> 02:34:39.457]  There's certainly been a lot of very legitimate questions raised, and I can't help but say that on radio shows and at book signings, people are constantly asking me whether I really believe that 19 Arabs, a few of whom were trained, had minimal training as pilots... Couldn't get Cessnas off the ground.
[02:34:39.497 --> 02:34:46.120]  Yeah, directed by a man with a walkie-talkie in a cave in the mountains of Afghanistan, could have really done this without any inside help.
[02:34:46.300 --> 02:34:48.903]  Yeah, how did Bin Laden make NORAD stand down for an hour and a half?
[02:34:48.963 --> 02:34:57.971]  How did he make the CIA run drills of the exact same thing happening, the same planes hitting buildings, the same buildings, at the exact same time so NORAD would stand down?
[02:34:58.232 --> 02:35:00.794]  How did Bin Laden get his family flown out by George Bush?
[02:35:01.054 --> 02:35:03.937]  How did Bin Laden have the code name Tim Osmond and the CIA?
[02:35:03.957 --> 02:35:07.921]  These are very legitimate questions, and I have no answer for them.
[02:35:07.981 --> 02:35:10.844]  As I said, it would be pure speculation on my part.
[02:35:12.405 --> 02:35:18.588]  I think the United States needs to, I think more people need to ask these questions, and I think our official, our government needs to ask these questions.
[02:35:18.988 --> 02:35:24.450]  As far as I know, there hasn't been any really serious investigation into what happened on 9-11.
[02:35:24.610 --> 02:35:27.411]  Well, the so-called Independent Commission was appointed by Bush.
[02:35:27.711 --> 02:35:36.134]  Well, there hasn't been a real police investigation in the way one would occur if a Brinks truck, for example, had been robbed of a few million dollars in Manhattan.
[02:35:37.259 --> 02:35:37.720]  That's right.
[02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:44.267]  They wouldn't let anybody photograph the wreckage, and they hauled it off, and the oldest firefighter group in the country said it was a cover-up.
[02:35:45.869 --> 02:35:47.892]  Okay, Mike, a really good final question.
[02:35:47.912 --> 02:35:50.675]  I'm very glad that you raised that with our guest.
[02:35:51.055 --> 02:35:56.942]  Just in closing, Mr. Perkins, author of Confessions of an Economic Hitman, and stores now are at Amazon.com.
[02:35:58.822 --> 02:36:03.948]  I want to talk about just a few other ways this economic mechanism works.
[02:36:03.968 --> 02:36:09.014]  I mean, they take our tax money that was fiat to begin with, they give it to the IMF or World Bank,
[02:36:09.908 --> 02:36:28.265]  Or the XM Bank or for the OECD or any of these groups, they then take money and give it to third world dictators or third world governments and then come in when they default, and they always default, and then grab all of the economic wealth, all the resources.
[02:36:30.347 --> 02:36:32.309]  Just a little bit more how that scam works.
[02:36:34.091 --> 02:36:37.694]  Well, it's really kind of a scam that's as old as the ages.
[02:36:37.714 --> 02:36:39.756]  It's something the mafia has been doing for years.
[02:36:40.417 --> 02:36:45.501]  You know, you put someone in a position where they can't repay what they owe you, and then you demand your pounds of flesh.
[02:36:46.382 --> 02:36:50.265]  And in this case, the pounds of flesh sometimes can be U.N.
[02:36:50.305 --> 02:36:54.509]  votes, sending troops to support us in countries where we want them, like Iraq.
[02:36:55.453 --> 02:37:00.278]  And nine times out of ten, it's also about taking resources from that country.
[02:37:00.679 --> 02:37:04.423]  These days, usually oil, but it could be something like the canal.
[02:37:04.483 --> 02:37:10.890]  In the case of Panama, bauxite, there's many different... Basically, we control the valuable minerals around the world.
[02:37:10.990 --> 02:37:13.633]  And it's all just zeros and ones and computers.
[02:37:13.913 --> 02:37:15.395]  It's all just fiat money.
[02:37:17.065 --> 02:37:21.608]  Well, it's done in dollars at this point, and we make dollars.
[02:37:21.708 --> 02:37:27.532]  We print dollars, and dollars aren't backed by anything but our say-so, essentially, and people's confidence in them.
[02:37:27.972 --> 02:37:33.956]  So we're able to give out all this money to countries that don't repay their debts.
[02:37:34.176 --> 02:37:37.798]  You'd have to ask yourself, how can somebody keep lending money and not getting the money back?
[02:37:38.119 --> 02:37:40.520]  Well, it's quite easy if you print that money.
[02:37:40.981 --> 02:37:41.541]  Now, of course,
[02:37:42.222 --> 02:37:56.758]  If we should go to the Euro or some other currency, and Saddam Hussein threatened to go to the Euro, OPEC has threatened to go to the Euro, the United States is the largest single-debtor country in the world... Actually, the Arabs have just dumped 15% in the last two years of their dollars.
[02:37:57.099 --> 02:37:58.701]  Japan's saying they may have to do it.
[02:37:58.721 --> 02:38:02.204]  There was a record slide, the record levels yesterday.
[02:38:04.006 --> 02:38:10.729]  Boy, in fact, that is the final question and the final answer, and I appreciate all your time.
[02:38:11.489 --> 02:38:14.170]  What do you see happening in 2005 economically?
[02:38:15.431 --> 02:38:18.552]  I can't really predict that, to be honest with you.
[02:38:18.832 --> 02:38:20.293]  It's very difficult to say.
[02:38:22.199 --> 02:38:24.201]  The economy right now seems to be bounding back.
[02:38:24.301 --> 02:38:25.341]  Why is that happening?
[02:38:25.462 --> 02:38:26.522]  That's a good question.
[02:38:26.542 --> 02:38:28.864]  Well, the Federal Reserve's printing money hand over fist.
[02:38:29.304 --> 02:38:35.209]  And the House of Saud has kept their commitment and oil prices are going down once again.
[02:38:37.026 --> 02:38:42.330]  It's really difficult to see where all this is going to take us at this point, and I wouldn't pretend to know that.
[02:38:42.470 --> 02:38:44.512]  I'm out of the economic forecasting business.
[02:38:44.532 --> 02:38:56.882]  Well, they can say on the surface it's rebounding, but key indicators like savings and debt ratios in every sector of the economy, things like factories and jobs and even service layoffs...
[02:38:57.202 --> 02:39:09.769]  Those are all at giant levels, and then they engage in all this economic chicanery and squirreliness where they'll go, well, if you're off the unemployment rolls, then that's someone who's employed.
[02:39:10.069 --> 02:39:11.870]  Well, you go off those in less than a year.
[02:39:11.890 --> 02:39:19.515]  Well, that's certainly true, but you know, Alex, when it comes right down to it, you and I don't have a heck of a lot of control over a lot of these things, but what we do have control over...
[02:39:19.995 --> 02:39:21.057]  Thank you very much.
[02:39:32.836 --> 02:39:34.237]  They've made huge impacts.
[02:39:34.537 --> 02:39:38.519]  Because of movements in this country, women vote today, and they couldn't 100 years ago.
[02:39:38.539 --> 02:39:43.801]  Whites ride on the same buses with blacks, which wouldn't have happened 40 years ago.
[02:39:44.201 --> 02:39:47.503]  Blacks drink out of water fountains they couldn't have drunken out of before.
[02:39:47.863 --> 02:39:57.007]  The Soviet Union collapsed because of movements, not because of armies, but because of labor unionists, playwrights, and poets who stood up to a regime there.
[02:39:57.563 --> 02:39:58.965]  Things happen with movements.
[02:39:59.065 --> 02:40:00.526]  We all need to get behind this.
[02:40:00.967 --> 02:40:01.507]  No, you're right.
[02:40:01.547 --> 02:40:08.174]  The establishment loves to bark and scream and talk about how big and invincible and we're the Borg, assimilate or die.
[02:40:08.555 --> 02:40:11.878]  But I have done over 1,700 radio interviews the last three years.
[02:40:13.960 --> 02:40:16.481]  And maybe one caller out of 30 disagrees with me.
[02:40:16.861 --> 02:40:19.822]  Six, seven years ago on my own talk show, half the callers disagreed.
[02:40:20.202 --> 02:40:22.262]  Now the broadcast is probably 80 times bigger.
[02:40:22.282 --> 02:40:23.823]  No one calls in disagreeing.
[02:40:24.123 --> 02:40:30.565]  So I've seen the shifts, and I think it's an establishment illusion that they're winning.
[02:40:31.025 --> 02:40:34.886]  Well, I agree with you, but we now have to take action.
[02:40:35.246 --> 02:40:38.927]  It's like we've done the first step of the program.
[02:40:38.947 --> 02:40:40.087]  We've admitted there's a problem.
[02:40:40.107 --> 02:40:40.848]  We've confessed.
[02:40:41.008 --> 02:40:41.628]  I've confessed.
[02:40:41.648 --> 02:40:42.468]  We've all confessed.
[02:40:43.058 --> 02:40:49.720]  Now we've got to do something, and the best way, I think, to do that is through organizing us, through supporting.
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:54.722]  If you don't want to get up and march in the streets, at least it gives support to a good movement.
[02:40:55.162 --> 02:40:56.222]  Listen, I agree with you.
[02:40:56.482 --> 02:41:00.163]  Sir, I can't wait to have you back on the broadcast, Confessions of an Economic Hitman.
[02:41:00.203 --> 02:41:01.524]  Plug those two websites for us.
[02:41:01.844 --> 02:41:05.945]  Dreamchange.org, and you can join a great movement there.
[02:41:05.965 --> 02:41:09.106]  That's a non-profit organization that I formed many years ago.
[02:41:09.745 --> 02:41:14.168]  And johnperkins.org, where you can find out where I'm speaking, doing book signings, etc.
[02:41:14.228 --> 02:41:14.948]  All right, sir.
[02:41:15.048 --> 02:41:17.390]  Thank you for going public, and we appreciate you joining us.
[02:41:17.670 --> 02:41:18.611]  Thank you for your show.
[02:41:18.631 --> 02:41:19.291]  I appreciate it.
[02:41:19.471 --> 02:41:19.932]  Take care.
[02:41:20.572 --> 02:41:21.813]  All right, there goes John Perkins.
[02:41:21.833 --> 02:41:22.673]  I don't have a lot of time.
[02:41:22.693 --> 02:41:31.039]  I've got to go straight to this Gary Webb, murdered Pulitzer Prize winning, I believe murdered, very suspicious suicide, they claim, two gunshots to the head, confirmed.
[02:41:31.279 --> 02:41:36.222]  Here's a GNN TV tribute to him.
[02:41:36.322 --> 02:41:37.443]  We'll try to air all of it.
[02:41:37.483 --> 02:41:37.803]  Here it is.
[02:41:38.917 --> 02:41:47.923]  Investigative reporting is being sort of squeezed out of the picture, and I think intentionally, because it tends to ruffle feathers.
[02:41:48.503 --> 02:41:54.967]  Good investigative reporting does ruffle feathers, and it draws lawsuits, and it gets newspapers in trouble.
[02:42:03.852 --> 02:42:11.418]  My name is Gary Webb.
[02:42:11.638 --> 02:42:13.099]  I am an investigative journalist.
[02:42:13.139 --> 02:42:17.343]  I've been an investigative journalist for about 25 years for daily newspapers.
[02:42:18.183 --> 02:42:25.129]  And in 1996, I wrote a series of stories entitled Dark Alliance, which is about CIA involvement in drug trafficking.
[02:42:32.924 --> 02:42:45.730]  What my story showed was that the cocaine that was being sold in those neighborhoods was coming from mainly one source, and this one source was being used to finance a guerrilla war in Central America.
[02:42:52.293 --> 02:43:02.158]  The general idea of the CIA dealing drugs was something that the American mainstream press had never written about before, and that's why it prompted outrage.
[02:43:03.377 --> 02:43:15.171]  Among blacks, among drug reform activists, among politicians, by the CIA, by every federal agency involved in the drug war, because it showed they weren't doing their jobs.
[02:43:15.772 --> 02:43:16.453]  There was a fraud.
[02:43:23.406 --> 02:43:28.968]  Right after we published the stories, the support we got from the media was very favorable.
[02:43:29.768 --> 02:43:33.950]  Newsweek Magazine did a big piece on the story and said it was well-documented and well-researched.
[02:43:34.390 --> 02:43:36.811]  The website was getting like a million hits a day.
[02:43:36.831 --> 02:43:39.432]  There were marches in Watts.
[02:43:39.452 --> 02:43:41.272]  There were marches in Compton.
[02:43:41.292 --> 02:43:42.473]  There were candlelight vigils.
[02:43:43.553 --> 02:43:47.315]  Every California senator demanded an official investigation.
[02:43:49.055 --> 02:43:51.296]  So the story itself was really building momentum.
[02:43:54.995 --> 02:43:56.656]  The government reaction was no reaction.
[02:43:57.697 --> 02:44:05.283]  And this, I believe, was a very careful strategy because nobody was going to believe the government if they came out and said we didn't do it.
[02:44:06.443 --> 02:44:11.387]  The proof was fairly overwhelming since we had all these government documents showing that it had happened.
[02:44:12.428 --> 02:44:19.673]  So what happened was they let the so-called liberal press speak for them.
[02:44:20.473 --> 02:44:38.856]  And they had the national security reporters at the Washington Post, who coincidentally used to work for the CIA, write stories saying, it doesn't mean anything.
[02:44:39.756 --> 02:44:48.878]  It was a distraction from what the story said, and it became sort of a media war between the Mercury News, which stood behind the story at that point,
[02:44:49.757 --> 02:44:53.320]  And the rest of the establishment media who wanted us to back away from it.
[02:44:54.260 --> 02:45:07.389]  And part of that reason was because these major newspapers had written about this issue back in the 1980s but had written about it very dismissively as if this is nonsense, it doesn't happen, it never happened.
[02:45:08.270 --> 02:45:17.115]  And then ten years later we came back with documentation showing that it was absolutely true and that it was worse than it was.
[02:45:17.155 --> 02:45:19.317]  We had gotten a story out around them.
[02:45:21.083 --> 02:45:24.886]  And we had gotten it out in a big way that they couldn't control, and that was through the Internet.
[02:45:25.486 --> 02:45:37.096]  And I think a lot of this was directed to the Mercury News to say, we don't care what documentation you have, we don't care what kind of story you've got, we set the national news agenda.
[02:45:37.817 --> 02:45:41.700]  And if we don't like your story, we will kill your story regardless if it's true.
[02:45:47.831 --> 02:45:51.613]  The media rejoiced when this came out because it meant they had won.
[02:45:52.593 --> 02:46:07.620]  They had forced a newspaper to back away from a story that was true, simply because of this barrage of criticism, of mindless criticism, essentially, that really took its toll on the editors of the newspaper.
[02:46:08.300 --> 02:46:12.662]  And they were being seen as sort of outcasts from the clubs.
[02:46:13.756 --> 02:46:23.607]  And I think they made a political decision that it was better in the long run to take a dive on this story and get back in the good graces of the rest of the media.
[02:46:28.792 --> 02:46:31.876]  It was essentially a war between my editors and myself because I wouldn't
[02:46:32.734 --> 02:46:37.236]  Apologize for the story or back away from the story and fought them on it.
[02:46:37.276 --> 02:46:37.696]  Publicly.
[02:46:38.357 --> 02:46:44.460]  And so they transferred me to a bureau that was 140 miles from where I lived and I called in sick a lot.
[02:46:52.544 --> 02:47:01.748]  One of the things I'm proudest of in regards to that story is the website that Mercury News set up because it really was the first time
[02:47:02.837 --> 02:47:10.601]  That a newspaper brought its readers not only into the interior of the paper, but into the reporter's notebooks.
[02:47:11.982 --> 02:47:17.565]  You know, this was a story that, as I told my editors, had a very high unbelievability factor built into it.
[02:47:17.945 --> 02:47:20.386]  A lot of people were going to say, this can't be true.
[02:47:21.487 --> 02:47:26.149]  And this story became a sensation because of the website.
[02:47:26.789 --> 02:47:29.971]  Not because of the story, but because people could get to it.
[02:47:31.094 --> 02:47:43.817]  And they could never have gotten to it before because the San Jose Military News is a small regional newspaper in Northern California that you couldn't read if you lived in New York or you couldn't read if you lived in L.A.
[02:47:44.558 --> 02:47:48.979]  But this story you could read anywhere in the world and see all of our documentation.
[02:47:49.219 --> 02:47:57.441]  So it became, and we did this on purpose, to make it very hard to knock down, to make it very difficult for people to say this didn't happen.
[02:47:58.141 --> 02:47:59.922]  But they said it didn't happen anyway.
[02:48:13.596 --> 02:48:37.589]  Old pirates, yes they rob I Sold I to the merchant ships Minutes after they took I From the bottomless pit But my hand was made strong By the hand of the Almighty
[02:48:39.571 --> 02:48:49.861]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.061 --> 02:48:54.485]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.625 --> 02:48:59.029]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.069 --> 02:49:00.411]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.173 --> 02:49:06.397]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.457 --> 02:49:13.405]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.525 --> 02:49:15.548]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:15.828 --> 02:49:20.472]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:50:06.821 --> 02:50:13.325]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[02:50:13.505 --> 02:50:18.627]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[02:50:18.727 --> 02:50:27.591]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[02:50:27.851 --> 02:50:31.153]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5.

[02:51:46.378 --> 02:51:51.499]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:52.180 --> 02:51:54.540]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:51:57.721 --> 02:52:01.562]  We got about 90% of that Gary Webb tribute aired.
[02:52:02.702 --> 02:52:04.442]  I might air it tomorrow in the first hour again.
[02:52:04.462 --> 02:52:10.124]  Do you believe he really shot himself twice in the head with a 38 special?
[02:52:10.144 --> 02:52:11.444]  Do you really believe that?
[02:52:12.648 --> 02:52:16.411]  You believe any of the propaganda coming out of people that are saying, oh yes, he committed suicide?
[02:52:17.932 --> 02:52:18.553]  It's amazing.
[02:52:20.194 --> 02:52:22.295]  That's no longer a guy who's going to commit suicide to you?
[02:52:24.837 --> 02:52:32.864]  And I remember I interviewed Gary Webb a couple times, three or four years ago, and it was a few months ago, I was thinking about, man, I need to interview Gary Webb again, and I didn't.
[02:52:33.304 --> 02:52:35.546]  Then I remember one time, for some reason, he called me.
[02:52:35.566 --> 02:52:37.987]  About three years ago.
[02:52:38.007 --> 02:52:39.649]  The disc is somewhere in the...
[02:52:40.640 --> 02:52:41.861]  Piles of stuff I've got.
[02:52:41.881 --> 02:52:42.522]  People have mailed me.
[02:52:42.542 --> 02:52:44.103]  I meant to create a website and do it.
[02:52:44.143 --> 02:52:45.024]  Just never got to it.
[02:52:45.445 --> 02:52:47.747]  He said, you know, we have this San Jose Mercury News website.
[02:52:48.487 --> 02:52:49.248]  And they took it down.
[02:52:50.089 --> 02:52:50.970]  Here's these discs.
[02:52:51.010 --> 02:52:53.172]  And I'd like you to create a website, Alex, and put it up.
[02:52:54.012 --> 02:52:54.933]  And I never did it.
[02:52:56.315 --> 02:53:01.119]  With all the documents and all the eyewitness reports and the court stuff, it was important.
[02:53:01.719 --> 02:53:04.302]  I've got like two storage rooms full.
[02:53:05.683 --> 02:53:07.907]  Of just videos and documents and everything else.
[02:53:07.947 --> 02:53:08.849]  I need to go dig that out.
[02:53:08.869 --> 02:53:10.392]  It'd be like trying to find a needle in a haystack.
[02:53:10.632 --> 02:53:12.716]  But I think he got that stuff on a website.
[02:53:12.736 --> 02:53:13.658]  I'm not sure which one it is.
[02:53:13.698 --> 02:53:14.339]  I should find that.
[02:53:14.359 --> 02:53:17.144]  But I've heard it's out there so that's good.
[02:53:19.278 --> 02:53:20.279]  Here's this next clip.
[02:53:20.779 --> 02:53:24.982]  This is Kansas City News talking about depleted uranium as if causing deaths.
[02:53:25.022 --> 02:53:25.523]  Here it is.
[02:53:25.983 --> 02:53:31.487]  A soldier survives Iraq but dies of a mysterious illness his family suspects the government is hiding.
[02:53:31.948 --> 02:53:36.511]  NBC Action News reporter Ron Mott is live with the story you'll see only on NBC Action News.
[02:53:36.591 --> 02:53:36.791]  Ron?
[02:53:37.152 --> 02:53:42.776]  Elizabeth, it's a complaint heard all over the country that soldiers are being poisoned by their own ammo.
[02:53:42.816 --> 02:53:48.060]  They, of course, are made to kill the enemy, but as one Raytown family says, they've turned into unfriendly fire.
[02:53:49.187 --> 02:53:56.450]  You know, they come out in five minutes and said, he's gone.
[02:53:56.891 --> 02:54:01.873]  For nearly a year and a half, Dwayne Garten worried that his son might return from Iraq in a body bag.
[02:54:02.133 --> 02:54:04.274]  This is worse than if he'd have got killed over here, really.
[02:54:04.594 --> 02:54:15.319]  Instead, decorated 35-year-old Army Sergeant Clay Garten spent an agonizing three weeks dying in his parents' Raytown home and at the VA hospital, eventually losing the fight the day after Christmas.
[02:54:15.339 --> 02:54:17.020]  35 years I had the boy.
[02:54:20.041 --> 02:54:24.563]  He went through six months of hell, and he come back, and they didn't do nothing for him.
[02:54:25.383 --> 02:54:29.084]  That's what I don't understand, why they couldn't do something for him.
[02:54:29.405 --> 02:54:32.126]  This is Seth, and this is Mr. Gage.
[02:54:32.546 --> 02:54:43.210]  A father of three, Claygarten's family believes the Army medic is every bit a casualty of war as those who die on the front lines, after they say he became exposed to depleted uranium dust used in some U.S.
[02:54:43.270 --> 02:54:43.790]  ammunition.
[02:54:44.170 --> 02:54:46.871]  The government contends the health risks are low.
[02:54:46.991 --> 02:54:48.952]  I think they know exactly what's going on.
[02:54:50.596 --> 02:54:54.198]  I think these troops over there are all in danger of this stuff.
[02:54:54.518 --> 02:55:04.344]  The family says Garten lost 30 pounds before he died, starting with a debilitating back spasm earlier this month that was followed by a series of high fevers reaching 106 degrees.
[02:55:05.024 --> 02:55:14.870]  It was hard to watch my son from such a big, strong, intelligent man to turn into a small...
[02:55:16.096 --> 02:55:16.537]  Perfect.
[02:55:16.777 --> 02:55:20.342]  Meanwhile, a grieving father mourns his lost fishing and hunting buddy.
[02:55:21.823 --> 02:55:23.165]  That's the only way I can remember him.
[02:55:23.245 --> 02:55:24.447]  I don't want to remember this.
[02:55:25.368 --> 02:55:26.269]  It's too painful.
[02:55:27.491 --> 02:55:30.695]  If you were in my body right now, you'd know how hard it hurts.
[02:55:32.071 --> 02:55:35.873]  A memorial fund has been set up in Clay Garten's name to benefit his three kids.
[02:55:35.913 --> 02:55:40.115]  For more information, call the Bank of America Raytown Branch at 816-979-6292.
[02:55:40.396 --> 02:55:48.300]  And the family did have tissue samples taken from Clay Garten's body, hoping that they will lead to some concrete answers.
[02:55:50.161 --> 02:55:56.324]  Folks, the head scientist, the head of the Pentagon's DE program is deathly ill from it.
[02:55:56.364 --> 02:55:57.405]  Most of his team has died.
[02:55:58.085 --> 02:55:59.126]  They're training manuals.
[02:56:00.032 --> 02:56:04.293]  As early as 86, say, you breathe it, from the heavy metal alone, it's going to kill you.
[02:56:05.013 --> 02:56:15.575]  Not to mention the two grams of radiation that the New York Daily News found in everyone they tested who had radiation sickness.
[02:56:16.715 --> 02:56:18.575]  So, there's your New World Order for you.
[02:56:18.615 --> 02:56:21.756]  That's how you support the tribes, is not caring about them, not giving them treatment.
[02:56:22.756 --> 02:56:24.516]  And they do the same thing for the vets.
[02:56:26.657 --> 02:56:28.437]  The older vets with other problems.
[02:56:29.241 --> 02:56:30.986]  The New World Order doesn't care about you.
[02:56:31.748 --> 02:56:32.430]  See you back tonight.
[02:56:32.530 --> 02:56:33.071]  Back tomorrow.
[02:56:33.994 --> 02:56:34.616]  Hello, folks.
