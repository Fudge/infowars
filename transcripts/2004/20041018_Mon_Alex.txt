[00:00:05.532 --> 00:00:06.172]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:07.914]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.614 --> 00:00:09.735]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.355 --> 00:00:11.196]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.936 --> 00:00:13.878]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.898 --> 00:00:17.180]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.763]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:39.285]  Chronicling the criminal activities of the global elite, also known as the New World Order.
[00:00:40.486 --> 00:00:41.986]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:00:42.607 --> 00:00:45.768]  It is Monday, already the 18th day of October 2004.
[00:00:45.828 --> 00:00:50.830]  We're going to take a ton of phone calls today.
[00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:57.493]  Any issue you want to discuss, any news item you want to cover, any comment, any question, you disagree with me, you agree with me,
[00:00:58.251 --> 00:00:59.452]  It's wide open.
[00:00:59.472 --> 00:01:03.055]  I do have a few issues I'd like to discuss and like to get your comments on as well.
[00:01:03.075 --> 00:01:03.656]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:03.696 --> 00:01:17.427]  No guests today because I want to have plenty of time to talk to everybody out there, but I will limit your calls to about a minute and a half apiece, and I've been getting better and better at that so everybody gets a chance to be involved on the broadcast.
[00:01:17.447 --> 00:01:17.507]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:01:17.527 --> 00:01:19.989]  Crude oil explodes and surges past $55 per barrel.
[00:01:29.045 --> 00:01:30.166]  Also, a U.S.
[00:01:30.206 --> 00:01:35.110]  News & World report coming out saying that John Ashcroft probably won't be in the next administration.
[00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.691]  Some other interesting tidbits.
[00:01:37.912 --> 00:01:39.694]  Organ trafficking in Baghdad.
[00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:42.536]  U.S.
[00:01:42.556 --> 00:01:43.737]  $30,000 for a kidney.
[00:01:43.857 --> 00:01:45.278]  That's the Asia News Channel.
[00:01:45.298 --> 00:01:48.300]  They've got a great domestic product now, just like China.
[00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:53.064]  FBI chief warns of possible terror attacks before U.S.
[00:01:53.244 --> 00:01:53.905]  elections.
[00:01:53.985 --> 00:01:55.486]  Meanwhile, Time Magazine says that
[00:01:56.195 --> 00:01:57.215]  There's really no problem.
[00:01:57.235 --> 00:01:58.916]  The terror fears are lessening.
[00:02:00.196 --> 00:02:02.957]  And court terror fears can't curb liberty.
[00:02:02.997 --> 00:02:06.138]  Some good news out of the Associated Press in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:02:06.238 --> 00:02:11.040]  Fear of a terrorist attack is not sufficient reason for authorities to search people at a protest.
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.202]  A federal appeals court has ruled, saying September 11th cannot be the day liberty perished.
[00:02:19.082 --> 00:02:19.823]  So that's good news.
[00:02:19.843 --> 00:02:21.143]  There's been some good rulings lately.
[00:02:22.296 --> 00:02:26.700]  Continuing a very scary article out of the Times of London, Sunday Times.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.601]  We're going to cover this.
[00:02:28.642 --> 00:02:30.223]  This is their headline, by the way.
[00:02:30.384 --> 00:02:33.106]  Scientists find a way to make us slaves.
[00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:37.750]  That's what most of the research seems to be on in government-funded operations.
[00:02:38.671 --> 00:02:38.771]  U.S.
[00:02:38.811 --> 00:02:39.712]  confirms U.K.
[00:02:39.832 --> 00:02:41.754]  flu inoculations unusable.
[00:02:42.463 --> 00:02:44.205]  BBC, more news on that.
[00:02:44.265 --> 00:02:47.789]  Also, controversy erupts as voting begins in Florida.
[00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:52.734]  DNC carry ballot collection called unlawful.
[00:02:54.108 --> 00:02:58.049]  And more on the senator out of Minnesota evacuating last week.
[00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:59.469]  Again, I mentioned this, Time Magazine.
[00:02:59.809 --> 00:03:02.930]  Why didn't 99 other senators close up shop, too?
[00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.411]  Minnesota Senator Mark Dayton shuts down his office after CIA briefing.
[00:03:07.431 --> 00:03:10.372]  We've got some new developments there.
[00:03:10.992 --> 00:03:14.113]  Bush's brother rules out bid for the presidency in 08.
[00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:15.673]  Old Jebby boy.
[00:03:16.576 --> 00:03:19.177]  More on that mutiny that happened over the weekend.
[00:03:19.317 --> 00:03:20.738]  All of us refused to go.
[00:03:20.758 --> 00:03:29.041]  The military began punishing some 19 army reservists who balked at what they called a suicide mission and a death sentence in Iraq last week.
[00:03:29.501 --> 00:03:30.942]  National Guard members.
[00:03:30.962 --> 00:03:35.464]  Of course, people will call them cowards, but why don't our politicians go over there and fight?
[00:03:35.884 --> 00:03:40.326]  No, instead they're turning their own buildings into armored fortresses, afraid of us, the citizens.
[00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.580]  Refusing to let us have access to them as if we're all killers.
[00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:48.303]  But oh, let's send the National Guard in on suicide missions and old trucks breaking down.
[00:03:49.664 --> 00:03:52.565]  Indy media seizures, signals clamped down on dissent.
[00:03:52.585 --> 00:03:53.746]  We'll get into that.
[00:03:53.866 --> 00:03:58.028]  Dick Morris says the president needs a terror attack to win re-election.
[00:03:58.048 --> 00:04:00.670]  This is from the embattled O'Reilly factor.
[00:04:01.943 --> 00:04:16.290]  And continuing an open letter to Mr. Zelikow of the 9-11 Whitewash Commission, two of his bizarre quotes, where he talked about the conspiracy theories of 9-11 spreading through the country like a disease, endangering the whole body.
[00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.232]  We're a disease now, because we don't believe you're whitewashed and can dismantle it.
[00:04:21.852 --> 00:04:23.633]  And Steve McQueen's going to come back to TV.
[00:04:23.653 --> 00:04:24.913]  He's produced some new commercials.
[00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:26.394]  It doesn't matter that he's dead.
[00:04:26.794 --> 00:04:30.576]  Most people who watch it in screenings think he's alive again and believe the fake video.
[00:04:31.317 --> 00:04:32.898]  Just like the Fat Bin Laden video.
[00:04:34.358 --> 00:04:35.319]  This and a lot more.
[00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:37.720]  It's a big broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.860]  And, of course, your phone calls.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.042]  I'm going to go to them in this next segment.
[00:04:45.062 --> 00:04:45.403]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:04:45.443 --> 00:04:48.124]  Whatever is on your mind.
[00:04:49.404 --> 00:04:51.305]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:04:51.345 --> 00:04:52.865]  On the other side, don't forget the websites.
[00:04:52.965 --> 00:04:58.548]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, and PrisonPlanet.com, and the redesigned Infowars.net.
[00:05:01.326 --> 00:05:05.289]  Are you concerned about the quality of air and purity of water in your household?
[00:05:05.749 --> 00:05:12.794]  If you answered yes, then you owe it to yourself and your family to check out the amazing benefits of owning your own personal ozone generator.
[00:05:13.174 --> 00:05:17.277]  With an ozone generator, you can kill bacteria and viruses in your drinking water.
[00:05:17.798 --> 00:05:21.060]  Get rid of that stale air in your house that keeps recirculating.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.282]  Your new ozone generator will remove odors and provide a clean, fresh scent throughout your house.
[00:05:26.763 --> 00:05:31.425]  Call Cliff Scott Enterprises for one of the most affordable ozone generators available today.
[00:05:31.845 --> 00:05:35.007]  That number is 800-569-4340.
[00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:44.171]  The ozone generator is portable, has an internal blower for ozone disbursement into the air, and comes with a tube attachment for ozonating liquids.
[00:05:44.551 --> 00:05:45.932]  Best of all, it's affordable.
[00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:47.633]  It's only $385 and that includes the shipping.
[00:05:50.294 --> 00:05:59.513]  So call Cliff Scott Enterprises at 800-569-4340 for your personal ozone generator or visit on the web at cliffscott.com.
[00:06:00.766 --> 00:06:04.048]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.088 --> 00:06:08.291]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.532 --> 00:06:11.314]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.514 --> 00:06:13.916]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.096 --> 00:06:22.742]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:22.942 --> 00:06:24.283]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:06:24.483 --> 00:06:28.626]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path
[00:06:28.626 --> 00:06:29.607]  Not yet available?
[00:07:00.326 --> 00:07:07.168]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[00:07:07.468 --> 00:07:08.848]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:07:09.048 --> 00:07:11.249]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:07:11.389 --> 00:07:13.489]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:07:13.769 --> 00:07:18.690]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:23.051]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:07:23.311 --> 00:07:25.091]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:07:25.172 --> 00:07:35.814]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and findable microchips, and much, much more.
[00:07:35.974 --> 00:07:37.875]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:07:38.075 --> 00:07:41.936]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[00:07:42.036 --> 00:07:43.296]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[00:07:47.037 --> 00:07:48.737]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:48.917 --> 00:07:54.119]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:55.099]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[00:07:55.119 --> 00:07:55.579]  Big Brother.
[00:07:55.639 --> 00:07:56.779]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:09.067 --> 00:08:11.328]  You want answers?
[00:08:12.068 --> 00:08:12.949]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.969 --> 00:08:17.450]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.810 --> 00:08:21.892]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.633 --> 00:08:26.574]  I've been studying peak oil for a couple years, and...
[00:08:51.087 --> 00:08:57.369]  I want to do a couple of shows on it, a couple of interviews on it, from people that believe in peak oil and those that don't.
[00:08:58.370 --> 00:08:59.850]  And again, what is peak oil?
[00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:19.658]  There is a claim that we have already hit the peak level production of oil out of the ground that is needed, naturally occurring oil, and that now the prices are only going to go up and up because there is basically no more oil at the levels that we need it.
[00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:30.384]  And of course, the hard case your computer comes in, the glass you're drinking out of, most of your automobile is built out of it, trash bags, your clothes.
[00:09:31.646 --> 00:09:38.093]  A lot of stuff is made, in fact I'd say half the products out there or more, out of plastics.
[00:09:39.275 --> 00:09:41.137]  And that is made out of petrochemicals.
[00:09:41.897 --> 00:09:48.600]  That is extracted and produced out of the molecular chains in oil that comes out of the ground.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.201]  There's also debates of where does oil come from?
[00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:56.523]  We know some oil and coal, in fact coal has been proven, comes from...
[00:09:57.242 --> 00:09:59.283]  Dead decaying animals and plants.
[00:09:59.564 --> 00:10:04.647]  You know, they find the coal with the imprint of ferns and trees in it right here in Texas.
[00:10:05.247 --> 00:10:19.557]  But there's a lot of evidence pointing towards oil also being produced as part of a process with the interaction between the crust, the hard layer on the earth, and the molten magma beneath it in the mantle.
[00:10:20.998 --> 00:10:24.000]  Again, there's a bunch of scientists on both sides of it.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:25.701]  All I know is this.
[00:10:27.987 --> 00:10:37.373]  About a decade ago, I learned of about eight years ago, the United Nations started claiming that there wasn't enough fresh water on the face of the earth and the prices would have to explode.
[00:10:37.793 --> 00:10:53.183]  And of course they were putting out this propaganda because the big global corporations are buying up all the water supplies and want to create artificial scarcity so they can gouge you for it, not just for money, they print the money, but also for a tool of social control or neo-feudalism or serfdom.
[00:10:54.523 --> 00:10:56.765]  And they've artificially made diamond scarves.
[00:10:58.132 --> 00:11:00.034]  They've done the opposite with gold.
[00:11:00.074 --> 00:11:04.837]  They've artificially made it at least economically look somewhat more plentiful than it is.
[00:11:05.137 --> 00:11:10.801]  So there's a lot of manipulation that goes on in these controlled markets.
[00:11:12.262 --> 00:11:15.304]  And I see a lot of the telltale markers of that with oil.
[00:11:15.385 --> 00:11:24.271]  Plus, a lot of my family on both sides have worked in the oil industry at the level of exploration and refining, purification.
[00:11:25.496 --> 00:11:36.007]  And they have found giant light crude deposits all over Africa, all over Latin America, Central and South America, all over Alaska, all over Canada.
[00:11:36.928 --> 00:11:40.132]  There is oil near the surface all over the ocean.
[00:11:40.812 --> 00:11:48.020]  There is non-sweet oil or heavy crude all over the place as well.
[00:11:48.796 --> 00:11:52.549]  There is natural gas just shooting out of the ground all over the place.
[00:11:53.151 --> 00:11:55.199]  There are new systems that take our garbage.
[00:11:56.022 --> 00:12:03.325]  We just started recycling our disposable garbage that breaks down, not just the plastics and glass, and that was shipped.
[00:12:03.405 --> 00:12:06.887]  They can make high-quality fuel cheaply that burns even cleaner out of that.
[00:12:07.367 --> 00:12:13.850]  So we hear this line that we've exhausted our resources, and it's all over, and we've hit the peak of oil.
[00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:21.153]  Meanwhile, they've found giant fields in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Belarus.
[00:12:21.253 --> 00:12:23.594]  I mean, it just goes on and on and on.
[00:12:24.497 --> 00:12:25.098]  I think we're good to go.
[00:12:43.337 --> 00:12:48.601]  That they're gouging the daylights out of us and they're all recording record profits.
[00:12:49.182 --> 00:12:53.525]  I mean, if it was so scarce and such a problem, they wouldn't be recording such record profits.
[00:12:53.545 --> 00:12:57.347]  And again, I'm not against record profits if it was free market.
[00:12:57.768 --> 00:13:06.734]  This is an oligopoly, or a group of cartels merging prices and colluding together, giving you the same thing as a monopoly economically.
[00:13:09.076 --> 00:13:10.557]  And so that's all that's happening here.
[00:13:11.622 --> 00:13:16.504]  In my opinion, and what a lot of top scientists and researchers say, will we run out of oil?
[00:13:17.804 --> 00:13:25.127]  Most of the numbers show that we'll hit a real peak in oil around 100 years from now from the current oil supplies that they've found.
[00:13:25.147 --> 00:13:27.407]  Is some of it hard to get to?
[00:13:27.527 --> 00:13:28.208]  Yes.
[00:13:28.328 --> 00:13:29.068]  But can we get it?
[00:13:29.308 --> 00:13:30.028]  Yes.
[00:13:30.568 --> 00:13:34.650]  Is it all over and now horrible things have to happen to us?
[00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.710]  No.
[00:13:35.737 --> 00:13:36.197]  We're good to go.
[00:13:59.935 --> 00:14:03.179]  What they do is, see, global government is about centralization.
[00:14:03.219 --> 00:14:04.341]  It's not about free market.
[00:14:04.621 --> 00:14:06.343]  It's about going after the competition.
[00:14:06.704 --> 00:14:11.069]  It's like Pac-Man, where the Pac-Man just gets fatter and bigger and gobbles up everything.
[00:14:11.129 --> 00:14:16.496]  It's larger and larger, more and more centralized, the capacity for abuse greater and greater.
[00:14:18.613 --> 00:14:26.355]  And so out of this, we get this whole Malthusian social Darwinistic excuse or pretext for this.
[00:14:26.575 --> 00:14:30.136]  And, you know, the pretext over the last 50 years has been the people bomb.
[00:14:30.476 --> 00:14:34.317]  Why, if we got 5 billion people on Earth, the Earth will die overnight.
[00:14:34.358 --> 00:14:35.118]  Well, now it's 6.5 billion.
[00:14:36.298 --> 00:14:39.082]  That hasn't happened, and it isn't the people killing the earth.
[00:14:39.222 --> 00:14:40.804]  It's causing problems.
[00:14:40.844 --> 00:14:41.925]  It's dirty industries.
[00:14:42.286 --> 00:14:45.670]  It's genetic engineering, the patenting of life.
[00:14:45.970 --> 00:14:51.998]  All of this are much bigger threats to the environment, not just raw population numbers.
[00:14:54.525 --> 00:15:01.873]  And by the way, a volcano, a large erupting volcano, spews more pollution than all of modern industry does into the air.
[00:15:01.953 --> 00:15:03.375]  That's the government's own numbers.
[00:15:03.415 --> 00:15:04.016]  They admit that.
[00:15:04.356 --> 00:15:12.025]  So again, the Earth has a great power to clean itself and sponge itself of naturally occurring...
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:14.960]  We're good to go.
[00:15:32.785 --> 00:15:33.345]  We're good to go.
[00:15:59.601 --> 00:16:04.363]  The mass dumping of super poisonous chemicals legally into the world's oceans.
[00:16:05.224 --> 00:16:07.965]  The overfishing could be a serious problem.
[00:16:08.405 --> 00:16:11.026]  There are some things that are real environmental crises.
[00:16:12.066 --> 00:16:14.207]  But these aren't the issues that get focused in on.
[00:16:14.307 --> 00:16:17.709]  It's, we've got to take your land rights away for the environment.
[00:16:17.729 --> 00:16:21.551]  And then once they take your property, they build an amusement park or apartment complex on it.
[00:16:22.311 --> 00:16:22.371]  Or...
[00:16:23.878 --> 00:16:29.641]  We've got to tax and trace you when you drive your car and have controlled cities and not let you into the rural areas to protect them.
[00:16:29.801 --> 00:16:30.941]  This is all part of the plan.
[00:16:33.102 --> 00:16:35.183]  It all interfaces together.
[00:16:37.344 --> 00:16:47.408]  So if you want to talk about peak oil and you want to argue about it or if you want to recommend guests and different scientists on both sides of the issue, I've been doing a lot of research on this and got some ideas.
[00:16:48.029 --> 00:16:51.350]  I'm going to do quite a few interviews on this after the election.
[00:16:52.017 --> 00:17:09.225]  And I'm going to spend some time on it because it is a new story we're getting that is being used as effectively, and I think will be used more effectively for the entire police state than global warming has.
[00:17:10.926 --> 00:17:13.187]  Now, by the way, do I believe in global warming?
[00:17:13.567 --> 00:17:16.128]  Well, yes, I believe the Earth goes through natural cycles.
[00:17:17.927 --> 00:17:21.810]  You look at the numbers from 200 years ago, we went through another hot cycle.
[00:17:21.850 --> 00:17:24.131]  Before that, we went through a mini-cold cycle.
[00:17:24.392 --> 00:17:27.714]  We're due for another ice age coming up here in a couple hundred years.
[00:17:28.674 --> 00:17:29.635]  So do I believe in that?
[00:17:29.655 --> 00:17:31.756]  Do I believe the ozone hole is a problem?
[00:17:32.077 --> 00:17:35.319]  Well, no, because now they've proven that it's shrunken back down to nothing again.
[00:17:36.301 --> 00:17:49.351]  Ozone holes have always naturally occurred up near the poles because of the Van Allen radiation belts looping into the poles of the planet, blasting holes through it naturally.
[00:17:49.631 --> 00:17:50.972]  That's now been conclusively proven.
[00:17:51.212 --> 00:18:04.322]  But big industry, big money, the oil industry, big government, IMF, World Bank front groups openly fund the modern phony environmental movement putting out these sky is falling scenarios.
[00:18:06.236 --> 00:18:10.940]  It's just like how they talk about, you know, ten years ago, oh, well, you've got to get away from Freon.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:21.608]  Well, that was because the patent had run out on Freon, and we've got the documents where it was the big companies that owned the patent on Freon that lobbied to make you go to a new gas, which they owned and controlled.
[00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:29.674]  Ozone is naturally occurring and naturally being produced in the upper atmosphere.
[00:18:29.714 --> 00:18:30.295]  That's admitted.
[00:18:31.739 --> 00:18:40.923]  And ozone is produced and then falls rapidly and then deposits itself at ground level, at sea level.
[00:18:42.684 --> 00:18:51.788]  So then why do they scientifically claim that it's formed here on the Earth when we artificially create it and then use these CO2s and then they supposedly go up?
[00:18:52.328 --> 00:18:53.468]  It's just not true!
[00:18:53.488 --> 00:18:56.830]  I mean, I've spent days and days and days
[00:18:57.671 --> 00:18:59.953]  Hour after hour researching this.
[00:19:00.193 --> 00:19:05.017]  So all the environmental crises they tell us about are frauds to centralized control.
[00:19:05.377 --> 00:19:12.562]  Meanwhile, all this very elite races ahead doing things that can be described as nothing less than apocalyptic.
[00:19:13.783 --> 00:19:20.809]  You know, the chimeras, the cross-species engineering, putting human genes into just hundreds of different species.
[00:19:22.229 --> 00:19:28.995]  Cloning embryos, growing them up to larger fetus size, and using them for body parts.
[00:19:29.396 --> 00:19:30.837]  These are the true nightmares.
[00:19:32.038 --> 00:19:33.539]  When we get back, we'll go straight to your calls.
[00:19:33.599 --> 00:19:34.680]  Chris in Kentucky and others.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:35.120]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:19:35.221 --> 00:19:37.763]  Then we'll get into crude oil prices surge past $55 per barrel.
[00:19:37.983 --> 00:19:38.764]  New terror alerts.
[00:19:44.632 --> 00:19:46.354]  FBI saying brace for attacks.
[00:19:46.394 --> 00:19:48.415]  Meanwhile, other parts of the government say why.
[00:19:48.735 --> 00:19:50.116]  Don't worry, there's no problem.
[00:19:50.657 --> 00:19:52.878]  So we'll get through all these mixed signals as well.
[00:19:53.679 --> 00:19:56.061]  Giant broadcast lined up for you today.
[00:19:56.521 --> 00:19:57.882]  PrisonPlanet.tv.

[00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:09.231]  It still is.
[00:20:09.787 --> 00:20:10.348]  We're good to go.

[00:21:03.904 --> 00:21:11.270]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:21:11.570 --> 00:21:15.974]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:21:16.254 --> 00:21:26.083]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:21:26.844 --> 00:21:30.508]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[00:21:30.848 --> 00:21:33.371]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.

[00:21:39.798 --> 00:21:41.340]  These days, that's just plain smart.

[00:21:42.601 --> 00:21:45.583]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.

[00:24:01.122 --> 00:24:03.826]  The Alex Jones Show
[00:24:15.976 --> 00:24:17.337]  Again, thank you for joining us.
[00:24:17.357 --> 00:24:21.001]  We're going to go straight to your calls now and then back into all the news that I aforementioned.
[00:24:21.701 --> 00:24:23.943]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris in Kentucky.
[00:24:24.003 --> 00:24:24.824]  Chris, you're on the air.
[00:24:24.864 --> 00:24:25.204]  Welcome.
[00:24:25.685 --> 00:24:26.345]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:24:26.645 --> 00:24:29.068]  Alex, I wanted to recap on that news report about the schools.
[00:24:29.128 --> 00:24:30.509]  I had a clip that I played.
[00:24:30.529 --> 00:24:32.030]  It was taped and it was given to me.
[00:24:32.891 --> 00:24:38.556]  What they did was that the school officials said they won't be specific in what they're going to talk about.
[00:24:38.576 --> 00:24:39.917]  They're going to protect diagrams.
[00:24:39.937 --> 00:24:42.059]  Then they're going to have these chemical release drills.
[00:24:42.509 --> 00:24:46.931]  And put children in holding quarters and have their parents watch the media until they're allowed to go get them.
[00:24:47.352 --> 00:24:48.552]  I mean, this is so obvious.
[00:24:49.173 --> 00:24:55.616]  Okay, now, you called last week and you said locally there on your news, they said because of threats to the schools...
[00:24:56.881 --> 00:25:05.444]  That they're not going to allow parents to come get their children during real emergencies, and then during these drills, they're going to drill doing it.
[00:25:05.764 --> 00:25:08.585]  And again, long before 9-11, they were already setting this up.
[00:25:08.666 --> 00:25:15.888]  Now, with the so-called Chechnyan threat coming across the border all over the country, they've told police, terrorists will probably strike our schools.
[00:25:16.348 --> 00:25:17.829]  And then if terrorists never attack...
[00:25:18.289 --> 00:25:31.898]  Still, they've trained them to do this, and last year they reported, again, Gannett News Service, Washington Post, that during a red alert, they're going to take your children and take them to a facility, and this sets the precedent that your children aren't yours.
[00:25:31.958 --> 00:25:32.379]  Go ahead.
[00:25:32.499 --> 00:25:34.340]  And at the end of this report...
[00:25:34.884 --> 00:25:43.131]  She said that parents are to stay tuned for their local media, and children will be at holding quarters until they are reunited.
[00:25:43.211 --> 00:25:46.614]  Now, are they saying during a drill this will happen, or after a real emergency?
[00:25:46.874 --> 00:25:49.496]  After a real emergency, and then they're talking about these chemical drills.
[00:25:49.536 --> 00:25:55.982]  Now, what I didn't get was, why did the reporter say school officials were not specific on this?
[00:25:56.022 --> 00:25:56.783]  Well, because... Well, look...
[00:25:58.917 --> 00:26:02.559]  Again, this is a complex issue you brought up, but they've said this.
[00:26:03.140 --> 00:26:16.267]  The schools are laboratories to train your children how to tattle on each other, how to be videotaped in the classroom, how to write, you know, ledgers in the seventh grade about their family life that are given to the police.
[00:26:16.347 --> 00:26:17.848]  I have all the news articles on this.
[00:26:18.248 --> 00:26:26.233]  They have drills coast to coast that homeschoolers are terrorists coming to kill them any minute to demonize homeschoolers to the faculty, parents, and students.
[00:26:26.753 --> 00:26:33.436]  Before 9-11, they had these drills where they put guns to the kids' heads and march them onto school buses to be taken to FEMA centers.
[00:26:33.877 --> 00:26:44.962]  This is training children how, in the future, maybe a decade from now, maybe a month from now, whenever it happens, to be loaded up on buses, how to be good little prisoners, how to go to the camps for their safety.
[00:26:45.362 --> 00:26:49.405]  Right, and that's why we're seeing an increasing number of police officers, even before 9-11, were doing this here.
[00:26:49.465 --> 00:26:53.727]  And they're just gradually, step by step by step, getting you conditioned.
[00:26:53.847 --> 00:26:56.148]  Well, if you have that newscast, please mail it to me.
[00:26:56.607 --> 00:26:57.948]  Yeah, I'm going to get a copy.
[00:26:58.588 --> 00:27:06.093]  It's just the way they reported it, it was so quick, it just seems like, well, it's so nice, and it's confusing the way... So you do have a VHS copy?
[00:27:06.494 --> 00:27:06.954]  Yes, I do.
[00:27:07.294 --> 00:27:11.617]  Well, please, please, please mail it to me and specifically say what's on the tape.
[00:27:12.237 --> 00:27:15.239]  Okay, I'll just say where it's from and about the school alert.
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:16.881]  Sure, anything else from the news piece?
[00:27:17.261 --> 00:27:20.043]  I just wanted to conclude that...
[00:27:20.939 --> 00:27:22.140]  I've told many, many people.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.124]  I've also got the Libertarian News pamphlets coming in.
[00:27:25.364 --> 00:27:28.468]  I'm putting your InfoWars.com on these mail-outs for information.
[00:27:28.508 --> 00:27:29.429]  I'm going to get the information.
[00:27:29.629 --> 00:27:30.710]  I've got to continue to do this.
[00:27:30.971 --> 00:27:31.571]  You're awesome.
[00:27:31.611 --> 00:27:32.553]  Keep it up, Chris.
[00:27:32.953 --> 00:27:33.313]  Okay.
[00:27:33.374 --> 00:27:34.735]  And I look forward to getting that video.
[00:27:34.915 --> 00:27:35.156]  All right.
[00:27:36.357 --> 00:27:39.601]  Look, I don't, again, have words to describe how evil this is.
[00:27:40.379 --> 00:28:00.514]  You say there's a threat to the schools in before Columbine, then Columbine happens, now it's a terrorist threat to the schools, and then you turn the schools into fences, you know, into barbed wire fences, into little mini prisons, and you train the children how to be rounded up a few times a year, and through their whole adult life now, they'll be prepared and conditioned to accept this.
[00:28:00.915 --> 00:28:02.476]  And it has nothing to do with keeping them safe.
[00:28:02.636 --> 00:28:05.318]  Meanwhile, the borders are completely, totally wide open.
[00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:11.393]  Where these supposed terrorists are coming across hell-bent on killing all the children.
[00:28:11.994 --> 00:28:15.596]  Let's go ahead and talk to Richard in Missouri.
[00:28:15.636 --> 00:28:16.257]  You're on the air.
[00:28:16.317 --> 00:28:16.757]  Go ahead.
[00:28:16.777 --> 00:28:17.678]  Hi.
[00:28:17.698 --> 00:28:22.582]  Do you think that there will still be a capture of Osama bin Laden coming up?
[00:28:23.169 --> 00:28:29.933]  What I've said for two and a half years is, and I've said in the article we wrote two and a half years ago, I don't know if it's disinfo.
[00:28:30.373 --> 00:28:32.195]  A White House official told me this.
[00:28:32.715 --> 00:28:39.479]  Now Madeleine Albright, Teresa Hines Carey, Senator Grassley, and others, a bunch of others, have said this.
[00:28:39.739 --> 00:28:41.100]  I don't know if that's going to happen.
[00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:42.701]  Looks like we're about to find out.
[00:28:43.371 --> 00:28:47.654]  Okay, do you think you know why they would do that, what their motivation would be?
[00:28:47.894 --> 00:28:53.718]  Well, they may not do it now, if it was a true story, because we've exposed it, and there's been so much attention on it.
[00:28:53.978 --> 00:29:00.883]  But they would obviously do it right before the election, you know, as a big booing effect.
[00:29:00.983 --> 00:29:05.206]  Oh, look, I mean, Bush's approval ratings exploded when they captured Saddam.
[00:29:07.488 --> 00:29:11.791]  Okay, but I thought they didn't really care who gets into office, whether it's Bush or Kerry.
[00:29:12.395 --> 00:29:14.557]  They don't, but it's all part of the theater.
[00:29:14.857 --> 00:29:15.157]  I see.
[00:29:15.517 --> 00:29:17.759]  It's all part of a wider theater.
[00:29:18.139 --> 00:29:29.948]  Unless there really is a split inside the New World Order, which some have surmised, between the European elite and this current neocon crop, and in case they really are battling it out somehow.
[00:29:29.968 --> 00:29:31.089]  All right, thank you.
[00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:32.030]  Is that it?
[00:29:32.050 --> 00:29:32.911]  Those are good questions.
[00:29:32.951 --> 00:29:33.111]  Yes.
[00:29:34.008 --> 00:29:36.330]  Does that satisfactorily answer your questions?
[00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:36.890]  Yeah, it does.
[00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:37.211]  Thank you.
[00:29:37.631 --> 00:29:37.731]  Okay.
[00:29:37.751 --> 00:29:39.753]  I just wanted to see if you had an opinion on it yourself.
[00:29:40.093 --> 00:29:40.994]  But those are good questions.
[00:29:41.034 --> 00:29:41.314]  Thank you.
[00:29:41.994 --> 00:29:48.219]  Robert Nethers, you're up next when we get back on a ton of news at 1-800-259-9231.
[00:29:48.479 --> 00:29:49.460]  We'll be right back.
[00:29:51.602 --> 00:29:52.522]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.983 --> 00:29:54.604]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.525 --> 00:29:58.207]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.224 --> 00:30:04.246]  You and your family members getting enough minerals in the daily diet?
[00:30:04.266 --> 00:30:07.148]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[00:30:07.368 --> 00:30:14.432]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[00:30:14.632 --> 00:30:17.914]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[00:30:18.155 --> 00:30:20.196]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[00:30:20.536 --> 00:30:28.361]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[00:30:28.541 --> 00:30:29.201]  We're good to go.
[00:30:58.781 --> 00:31:03.585]  SeamMineral.com More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:31:03.885 --> 00:31:08.829]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:31:09.070 --> 00:31:13.433]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:31:13.733 --> 00:31:22.641]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:31:22.841 --> 00:31:26.464]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:31:26.744 --> 00:31:31.791]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:31:32.091 --> 00:31:38.820]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[00:31:39.301 --> 00:31:39.681]  What about you?
[00:31:40.498 --> 00:31:41.218]  Call now to order at 1-888-803-4438.

[00:32:02.552 --> 00:32:08.017]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:32:08.457 --> 00:32:12.681]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:32:12.921 --> 00:32:19.968]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:32:20.348 --> 00:32:26.454]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:32:26.594 --> 00:32:27.795]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:27.975 --> 00:32:28.456]  We're good to go.
[00:32:44.738 --> 00:32:45.799]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:32:45.979 --> 00:32:47.680]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:16.015 --> 00:33:22.540]  1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[00:33:22.620 --> 00:33:25.923]  Wide open phones all three hours of the broadcast today.
[00:33:25.943 --> 00:33:28.645]  We're in the middle of the first hour, of course, right now.
[00:33:28.665 --> 00:33:38.113]  We're going to continue with a whole other gamut of calls, and then I'll get into this stack of news that I've already mentioned that is very, very important.
[00:33:38.133 --> 00:33:38.193]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:33:41.736 --> 00:33:51.888]  Before I go back to your calls, my 11th film is out on VHS and DVD, and I'm offering a special unlike no other special I've ever had before.
[00:33:53.169 --> 00:33:59.837]  And it's on the VHS and on the DVD, but the discount isn't quite as big on the VHS, because VHS costs a lot more than DVD.
[00:34:01.957 --> 00:34:07.380]  My friends, you get one copy of American Dictators on DVD, which is an hour and 15 minutes long.
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.081]  The VHS is 95 minutes long.
[00:34:09.642 --> 00:34:10.482]  For $19.95.
[00:34:11.403 --> 00:34:13.624]  Each additional copy is $5.95.
[00:34:16.025 --> 00:34:22.669]  After I pay for staff and the office and what it costs to make this film, we've calculated it.
[00:34:22.829 --> 00:34:24.870]  I'm not even really making a profit.
[00:34:25.130 --> 00:34:29.493]  I think it's 50 cents or something on this, but I don't care.
[00:34:30.894 --> 00:34:33.217]  That is on each additional copy you buy.
[00:34:33.337 --> 00:34:35.540]  I just want to get it out to people.
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:36.621]  That's my goal.
[00:34:37.082 --> 00:34:48.557]  American dictators documenting the staged election of 2004, how Bush and Kerry are cousins, how their policies are almost identical, skull and bones, new info on Bohemian Grove.
[00:34:49.655 --> 00:34:53.320]  Including the articles where they bust in the male porn stars and service them there.
[00:34:54.201 --> 00:34:55.182]  We've got all that.
[00:34:55.222 --> 00:34:56.584]  That's the first 15-20 minutes.
[00:34:56.865 --> 00:35:02.151]  Then we get into Patriot Act 2, the latest police state developments, the latest 9-11 information.
[00:35:02.712 --> 00:35:03.973]  It's a great video.
[00:35:04.094 --> 00:35:06.437]  We interview Gary Busey, Ralph Nader.
[00:35:07.337 --> 00:35:13.841]  Just a bunch of other people, Ron Paul, just a bunch of key info in this new film.
[00:35:13.881 --> 00:35:23.847]  So buy one copy, and buy 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, whatever, 20 more copies for $5.95 apiece, and give them to your friends, your family, your neighbors.
[00:35:24.267 --> 00:35:32.469]  And they're in the, you know, pretty little hard case with the color cover, so people like Eye Candy, your friends and family, are more likely to watch it because of the packaging.
[00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:36.211]  That's a big part of America today, judging books by their cover.
[00:35:36.531 --> 00:35:39.272]  But it's the material inside the video that's powerful.
[00:35:39.932 --> 00:35:42.412]  And then, of course, I have other discounts on all my other videos.
[00:35:42.432 --> 00:35:45.293]  The first ten I produced, they're all over two hours long.
[00:35:45.353 --> 00:35:47.074]  Take Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:35:47.894 --> 00:35:49.875]  It is two hours, 44 minutes long.
[00:35:49.935 --> 00:35:50.795]  It's a tour de force.
[00:35:51.643 --> 00:35:53.548]  Those are $25.95 a piece.
[00:35:53.568 --> 00:35:56.998]  $20 a piece if you order three or more.
[00:35:57.058 --> 00:35:59.725]  That's an $18 discount on the three-tape special.
[00:36:01.181 --> 00:36:05.042]  That's a $24 discount on the 4 tape special and so forth and so on.
[00:36:05.702 --> 00:36:10.364]  Also, I carried Paul Watson's book, Ordered Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror, and the New World Order.
[00:36:10.724 --> 00:36:12.004]  My book, Descent into Tyranny.
[00:36:12.304 --> 00:36:15.125]  George Humphrey's 9-11 video, 9-11, The Great Illusion.
[00:36:15.165 --> 00:36:15.765]  It's excellent.
[00:36:16.105 --> 00:36:20.447]  Eric Huffman's updated version of 9-11, Painful Deceptions.
[00:36:20.827 --> 00:36:28.289]  These are all on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com via the safe, secure online shopping carts.
[00:36:28.869 --> 00:36:32.373]  Or call toll-free to ask about different specials or to order the films.
[00:36:32.393 --> 00:36:33.715]  1-888-253-3139 That's 888-253-3139
[00:36:45.147 --> 00:36:46.527]  Or you can just write to me.
[00:36:46.627 --> 00:36:52.689]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:36:54.269 --> 00:36:55.750]  Please don't procrastinate.
[00:36:55.810 --> 00:36:56.850]  Please get the videos.
[00:36:57.390 --> 00:37:00.911]  Make copies of the films I've produced and get them out to folks.
[00:37:02.171 --> 00:37:07.533]  Or, one better, get a whole bunch of the new video, American Dictators, buy one for $19.95.
[00:37:08.313 --> 00:37:11.794]  That just helps me pay off the amount of money we spent making it.
[00:37:12.631 --> 00:37:14.192]  The people we paid to help us make it.
[00:37:14.812 --> 00:37:17.813]  And then it also, you get each additional copy for $5.95.
[00:37:18.713 --> 00:37:20.994]  So take advantage of that.
[00:37:21.014 --> 00:37:21.434]  888-253-3139.
[00:37:21.954 --> 00:37:28.056]  Or watch all of my videos and a bunch of other special weekly reports we do and the best audio interviews.

[00:37:30.997 --> 00:37:34.038]  You can go watch them all right there and read my book and Paul Watson's book as well.
[00:37:34.058 --> 00:37:36.138]  15 cents a day, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:37:36.178 --> 00:37:36.699]  You can't beat it.
[00:37:37.039 --> 00:37:38.339]  Alright, let's go back to the calls.
[00:37:38.359 --> 00:37:41.080]  And again, quickly, callers, your question, your comment, your statements...
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.261]  Robert in Denver, you're on the air.
[00:37:43.301 --> 00:37:43.781]  Go ahead.
[00:37:44.321 --> 00:37:45.582]  Good morning, Alex.
[00:37:45.602 --> 00:37:46.302]  Joe, listen to your show.
[00:37:46.342 --> 00:37:47.443]  Thank you very much for taking my call.
[00:37:47.463 --> 00:37:48.083]  Appreciate that.
[00:37:48.143 --> 00:37:48.483]  Thank you.
[00:37:48.503 --> 00:37:51.504]  I've got three things I want to touch base with you on, if I may.
[00:37:51.664 --> 00:37:58.707]  First off, I hope you want to, later on in the program, you talk more about the National Guard who refused to go on that mission in Iraq.
[00:37:59.267 --> 00:38:05.310]  I think the more I think about that, the more I believe it, because there was an article in Denver Post today in the back section saying,
[00:38:05.951 --> 00:38:15.254]  About then-Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez writing a letter to the top, the number two guy in the Army saying he didn't have enough equipment, not enough beans, not enough gas masks, not enough tanks or whatever.
[00:38:15.274 --> 00:38:24.776]  Now, do you mean you believe the National Guard folks that are saying, or you believe this because they had a general on TV Sunday admitting that they refused?
[00:38:25.436 --> 00:38:28.497]  Yeah, I mean, I think I believe that when they say it wasn't safe.
[00:38:28.777 --> 00:38:29.257]  That's what I mean.
[00:38:29.758 --> 00:38:35.099]  I think there's something to that because General Sanchez wrote a letter back in December saying he was short of equipment.
[00:38:35.751 --> 00:38:38.915]  So that kind of lends some praise to their argument.
[00:38:39.015 --> 00:38:40.537]  But yeah, I think that's something to that story.
[00:38:41.418 --> 00:38:41.938]  Absolutely.
[00:38:41.958 --> 00:38:42.499]  Anything else?
[00:38:42.940 --> 00:38:44.101]  Yeah, two things.
[00:38:44.221 --> 00:38:45.402]  You kind of touched on it last week.
[00:38:45.443 --> 00:38:46.544]  I don't know if you spoke to it or not.
[00:38:46.564 --> 00:38:47.465]  I didn't hear it, but you did.
[00:38:47.865 --> 00:38:55.915]  As you know, our friend O'Reilly is being hit with a sexual harassment suit by one of his female staffers.
[00:38:56.374 --> 00:38:57.215]  Excuse me, whatever.
[00:38:57.795 --> 00:38:59.216]  And speak to that if you could.
[00:38:59.236 --> 00:39:08.604]  And also, when I used to listen to him, which I don't anymore, I can't stand him, but he would always say, and he probably still does, that his show was the number one rated cable news network or news program.
[00:39:08.904 --> 00:39:11.786]  But then right after that, he'd say, well, cable doesn't do ratings.
[00:39:11.946 --> 00:39:13.748]  So how does that play out?
[00:39:13.808 --> 00:39:15.909]  Does cable rate their shows or don't they?
[00:39:16.490 --> 00:39:17.170]  Yes, they do.
[00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:18.531]  And thanks for the call.
[00:39:19.592 --> 00:39:24.416]  Okay, look, I said last Friday that I'm not going to get into the whole O'Reilly situation.
[00:39:25.279 --> 00:39:27.480]  Because I don't know if it's true.
[00:39:28.461 --> 00:39:31.803]  And frankly, you know, we hear about Chechny and his suitcase nukes.
[00:39:31.843 --> 00:39:32.984]  We don't know if that's true.
[00:39:33.704 --> 00:39:35.045]  But it's important to talk about.
[00:39:35.085 --> 00:39:37.447]  We hear about, you know, senators evacuating the Capitol.
[00:39:37.847 --> 00:39:39.948]  A new FBI alert of impending attacks.
[00:39:41.429 --> 00:39:43.150]  Things of that magnitude.
[00:39:43.250 --> 00:39:44.831]  Race-specific bioweapons.
[00:39:44.851 --> 00:39:47.913]  The government producing bioweapons that kill certain races of human beings.
[00:39:50.535 --> 00:39:52.676]  Certain subgroups of the human race, I should say.
[00:39:53.617 --> 00:39:53.677]  Uh...
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:57.342]  Again, that all outweighs O'Reilly.
[00:39:57.482 --> 00:39:59.264]  I mean, do I believe these allegations?
[00:39:59.804 --> 00:40:01.105]  I don't know, my friends.
[00:40:02.486 --> 00:40:03.687]  Does cable have ratings?
[00:40:03.807 --> 00:40:04.367]  Absolutely.
[00:40:04.387 --> 00:40:05.388]  Of course it has ratings.
[00:40:06.029 --> 00:40:09.371]  And the ratings come out every single day with the cable news shows.
[00:40:09.471 --> 00:40:14.895]  What O'Reilly has had is the number one rated cable news show.
[00:40:14.955 --> 00:40:18.518]  He's dwarfed by other cable channels with entertainment on them.
[00:40:20.058 --> 00:40:23.121]  But yes, he has the number one cable news show.
[00:40:23.141 --> 00:40:29.306]  He's got about 30% more viewers than, say, CNN and about, I don't know, double every time I see it than MSNBC.
[00:40:29.587 --> 00:40:30.848]  But personally, I don't care.
[00:40:31.388 --> 00:40:33.670]  I mean, Bill O'Reilly is a neocon.
[00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:35.392]  He poses as the middle of the rotor.
[00:40:35.672 --> 00:40:37.534]  He thinks SUVs should be banned.
[00:40:38.634 --> 00:40:42.758]  The guy stuck up for Dan Rather in the fake documents.
[00:40:42.858 --> 00:40:46.041]  I mean, I just don't have anything to say about Bill O'Reilly.
[00:40:47.722 --> 00:40:49.684]  But that's my comments on that.
[00:40:49.824 --> 00:40:56.069]  So, yeah, when he says the number one rated cable news show, see, that's a semantical statement there.
[00:40:56.089 --> 00:41:03.315]  I mean, any statement's a semantical statement, but it's a slight semantical manipulation implying the number one show on cable, and it's not.
[00:41:04.135 --> 00:41:04.976]  More power to them.
[00:41:05.016 --> 00:41:07.098]  I wish the number one stuff on cable was news.
[00:41:07.118 --> 00:41:10.761]  At least folks would be watching something and trying to get news.
[00:41:10.841 --> 00:41:12.342]  Most people just don't watch news.
[00:41:13.749 --> 00:41:19.494]  I mean, there's radio shows that... Bill O'Reilly thinks he has a good night if a couple million people tune into his show.
[00:41:20.054 --> 00:41:22.616]  Well, Rush Limbaugh has 22 million people tuning in.
[00:41:23.177 --> 00:41:25.698]  I mean, this radio show's got a couple million people every day.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.561]  It's very interesting.
[00:41:29.421 --> 00:41:32.904]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[00:41:32.944 --> 00:41:37.268]  Let's talk to Ron in Oklahoma.
[00:41:37.288 --> 00:41:37.928]  You're on the air.
[00:41:37.988 --> 00:41:38.449]  Go ahead.
[00:41:38.769 --> 00:41:40.170]  Alex, a couple things quickly.
[00:41:41.136 --> 00:41:46.658]  Art Bell said last night that broadband online had passed as of October 14th.
[00:41:47.219 --> 00:41:49.099]  I think even he is starting to see the light.
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:52.761]  There will be a total information blackout in this country.
[00:41:53.541 --> 00:42:02.945]  If we lose shortwave, then of course what you've been talking about with the internet too, we will only have censored, homogenized news and information.
[00:42:02.965 --> 00:42:09.068]  The American people won't be able to learn what the Europeans and the rest of the world already know that the
[00:42:09.707 --> 00:42:15.489]  Center for World Terrorism is not in a cave in Tora Bora, but 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, D.C.
[00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:20.852]  Also, our CO2 is a byproduct of beer manufacture.
[00:42:21.572 --> 00:42:24.373]  I only know how many tons of this stuff is made every day.
[00:42:24.873 --> 00:42:34.217]  Then it goes into soda pop to make the fifth, and it's also used in the food industry to flash freeze food, frozen food.
[00:42:35.338 --> 00:42:38.119]  And of course, there's no telling how many tons of this stuff is dumped in the
[00:42:38.547 --> 00:42:39.547]  The atmosphere every day.
[00:42:39.567 --> 00:42:42.328]  So, that's about it.
[00:42:42.628 --> 00:42:43.929]  Alright, good to hear from you, Ron.
[00:42:43.969 --> 00:42:45.449]  I appreciate the call.
[00:42:45.469 --> 00:42:48.891]  Okay, so there's not confusion.
[00:42:49.091 --> 00:42:55.913]  When he said broadband, they're talking about data transmission down power lines.
[00:42:57.094 --> 00:43:00.855]  And just as they started wide-scale testing of this three years ago,
[00:43:01.656 --> 00:43:04.338]  It has interfered with AM radio.
[00:43:04.858 --> 00:43:08.901]  It has interfered with AMs on the higher band of shortwave.
[00:43:09.662 --> 00:43:15.245]  It has interfered with mainline shortwave regionally in the areas where this is transmitted.
[00:43:17.047 --> 00:43:27.394]  Now, again, what happens is instead of sending data down phone lines or down fiber optic cables, they simply stream data
[00:43:29.032 --> 00:43:30.333]  Down power lines.
[00:43:30.753 --> 00:43:37.618]  And it then radiates that information and it turns the power lines into broadcast antennas.
[00:43:38.738 --> 00:43:45.843]  And so if they're having data transfer down your power line, you can forget picking AM radio up in your house or anywhere near this.
[00:43:47.797 --> 00:44:03.225]  And shortwave is even more susceptible to this, and the FCC admits, and the big industry groups are out there admitting, even AM radio groups have complained, that this is going to devastate AM and shortwave broadcast, and the feds don't care, they're going ahead with it.
[00:44:03.305 --> 00:44:04.546]  And it's a big, big issue.
[00:44:04.886 --> 00:44:14.911]  But there's a lot of problems with data transfer down power lines, so they're trying to implement it, but it's going to take years and years to do it, and it's also hard for them to do, because it's got to be a straight shot.
[00:44:16.092 --> 00:44:16.612]  Now they're
[00:44:17.575 --> 00:44:19.797]  Moving into other applications for it.
[00:44:19.837 --> 00:44:37.233]  That way, these power lines can be two-way, so that RFID chip in your shirt, or your egg carton, or your milk carton, or the Campbell's soup can can be read off of this, and they want to have wireless internet off the power lines as residents' transceiver towers.
[00:44:37.994 --> 00:44:39.736]  And that will be devastating.
[00:44:40.516 --> 00:44:40.616]  And...
[00:44:42.245 --> 00:44:43.425]  It's very, very serious.
[00:44:43.585 --> 00:45:07.630]  It wouldn't be so serious if they'd leave the Internet alone, because we could just run to the Internet, which has been wildly successful for alternative news, 45% in some of the major studies, 38% in some of the others, but the average, we're looking at 31%, of people have left mainstream television and cable altogether to the Internet.
[00:45:08.556 --> 00:45:12.377]  And the biggest block of that is alternative news and information.
[00:45:13.017 --> 00:45:16.358]  Now it has passed porn as the biggest thing on the web.
[00:45:18.099 --> 00:45:25.261]  Frankly, a lot of those that have left TV altogether are watching wild entertainment and porn and gambling and other unsundry things on the internet.
[00:45:25.301 --> 00:45:29.002]  But the biggest portion overall isn't gambling or porn.
[00:45:30.022 --> 00:45:32.363]  It is alternative news and information.
[00:45:33.044 --> 00:45:42.397]  And when my website gets millions of individual visitors per month, and my website is moderately sized compared to some of the alternative sites, the globalists are in deep trouble.
[00:45:43.433 --> 00:46:05.892]  And what you have on these sites is thousands of people posting information, news articles, the free flow of info, the equivalent of millions of analysts, some of them good, some of them bad, analyzing, deciphering, catching people in lies, and there's no way the NSA and CIA and their script writers and Lionel Shetland and others can keep track of it all.
[00:46:06.833 --> 00:46:08.274]  And so we're crushing them.
[00:46:08.775 --> 00:46:11.257]  We're exposing their lies faster than they can spew them.
[00:46:11.838 --> 00:46:14.499]  And so Internet 2 is going to try to take this over and restrict it.
[00:46:14.899 --> 00:46:16.140]  And I've gone over that in the past.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.161]  Let's go back to the calls.
[00:46:18.981 --> 00:46:21.002]  Let's talk to Jesse in Alabama.
[00:46:21.022 --> 00:46:21.702]  You're on the air.
[00:46:21.762 --> 00:46:22.223]  Go ahead.
[00:46:22.243 --> 00:46:24.163]  Hi, Alex.
[00:46:24.344 --> 00:46:27.965]  I was going to bring up the broadband and how it's going to knock out CB and all that.
[00:46:28.605 --> 00:46:30.966]  But you've already kind of touched on it.
[00:46:30.986 --> 00:46:33.628]  You might want to touch on the CB radio, how it affects that.
[00:46:33.808 --> 00:46:34.388]  Yeah, that too.
[00:46:34.508 --> 00:46:38.890]  All sorts of different transmissions will just be blotted out.
[00:46:39.928 --> 00:46:52.237]  Also, I wanted to alert people that I've read on the Internet and talked to the lady that has drugawareness.org and Dr. Anne Blake Tracy.
[00:46:52.677 --> 00:47:06.247]  These psychotropic drugs, antidepressants, anti-anxiety drugs, ADD drugs, they can cause retinal leaks to occur in people's eyes as well as retinal detachments.
[00:47:06.587 --> 00:47:08.989]  Sir, in these different drugs, own...
[00:47:10.004 --> 00:47:12.166]  Attachments that come in the bottle with them.
[00:47:12.907 --> 00:47:13.667]  The advisements.
[00:47:14.508 --> 00:47:22.674]  They admit retinal detachment, heart palpitations, swelling heart, shrinking heart, shrinking brain, retardation of growth.
[00:47:23.535 --> 00:47:35.585]  I mean, again, I know several families who have a son who isn't on the drugs, and another who is, and I've known them for most of their lives, and the one on the red one is a midget, and the one who isn't is six foot four.
[00:47:36.212 --> 00:47:47.077]  Yeah, they cause decreased blood flow not only to the brain, some of them, but also decreased blood flow to the eyes, and also some of them increase the ocular blood pressure in the eyes.
[00:47:47.137 --> 00:47:47.837]  I know.
[00:47:48.078 --> 00:47:58.302]  Well, I mean, look, the same reactions that cocaine and methamphetamine had are the exact same thing that pharmacological amphetamine Ritalin does.
[00:47:58.342 --> 00:47:59.683]  I mean, it's not any...
[00:48:00.899 --> 00:48:02.000]  Hard thing to understand.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:03.061]  Yes, good point.
[00:48:03.462 --> 00:48:10.728]  It's far more pure than the street drugs, these prescribed amphetamines, so they're far more addictive.
[00:48:10.748 --> 00:48:17.114]  And what's happened is, good point, now that people found out how deadly Ritalin is, they've come out with what, like seven different new speed drugs.
[00:48:17.174 --> 00:48:18.215]  Okay, well that is bad.
[00:48:18.456 --> 00:48:20.578]  Go on this, and it turns out that's even worse.
[00:48:20.838 --> 00:48:21.138]  Right.
[00:48:21.458 --> 00:48:23.520]  Not to mention the increased suicide.
[00:48:24.561 --> 00:48:26.063]  It's not our opinion.
[00:48:27.384 --> 00:48:27.844]  That's right.
[00:48:28.325 --> 00:48:31.227]  They create biochemical imbalances in the brain.
[00:48:31.707 --> 00:48:32.487]  It's just horrible.
[00:48:32.527 --> 00:48:49.279]  But one other thing I was going to ask you about, do you know of any kind of new research that's being developed on curing people's eye vision problems?
[00:48:49.319 --> 00:48:52.821]  Have you ever thought about having somebody on to talk about that?
[00:48:53.740 --> 00:48:56.603]  Well, that's, I mean, there's as many fishes in the sea.
[00:48:56.643 --> 00:48:59.065]  There's all sorts of wonderful new developments coming out.
[00:48:59.506 --> 00:49:03.850]  Unfortunately, a lot of the really good developments are restricted from the public.
[00:49:03.870 --> 00:49:04.611]  Thanks for the call.
[00:49:05.151 --> 00:49:07.354]  They've got hundreds of different ways to cure cancer.
[00:49:07.394 --> 00:49:07.914]  That's admitted.
[00:49:07.934 --> 00:49:12.639]  You always hear about some new cure and then it disappears and is bought up by a company and not deployed to the people.
[00:49:14.202 --> 00:49:16.063]  But the elites certainly get access to it.
[00:49:16.503 --> 00:49:21.005]  And they've got all sorts of new laser surgeries to reattach nerve endings in the eye.
[00:49:21.466 --> 00:49:23.427]  They've got all sorts of new drugs that'll do it.
[00:49:23.447 --> 00:49:25.828]  They've got all sorts of nutritional treatments.
[00:49:26.628 --> 00:49:29.829]  There's a lot of things they can do, and there's a lot of great things that have gone to the people.
[00:49:30.570 --> 00:49:31.610]  But again, I'm not a doctor.
[00:49:31.970 --> 00:49:37.833]  I do read about the developments on a daily basis, but I really can't comment on that, sir, because I'm not an expert on it.
[00:49:37.853 --> 00:49:39.914]  But there's just as many developments as you can imagine.
[00:49:41.023 --> 00:49:50.389]  Let's go to break, and when we come back, we will go to more of your calls, and I will get into the mutinies in Iraq, and this is only one of the public reports we've got.
[00:49:50.409 --> 00:49:52.230]  We've got hundreds of other such reports.
[00:49:52.791 --> 00:50:04.898]  I was talking to a soldier yesterday who just got back to Iraq, and no, he won't come on the show, and he says they're losing at least double what we're hearing, that he saw dead people every day, dead soldiers, and many more wounded.
[00:50:04.918 --> 00:50:09.581]  And I was talking to another lady yesterday whose brother's there, who she just talked to,
[00:50:10.450 --> 00:50:16.873]  And she said that it's at least six a day just in the area of Baghdad where he's at of dead U.S.
[00:50:16.913 --> 00:50:17.193]  troops.
[00:50:17.213 --> 00:50:22.396]  And then I talked to another woman yesterday whose ex-husband's in Iraq, and he told her the same numbers.
[00:50:23.736 --> 00:50:27.738]  So, again, it's amazing.
[00:50:28.338 --> 00:50:33.681]  It's amazing how they get this over on us, but we're continuing to track and expose it.
[00:50:33.701 --> 00:50:33.761]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:50:39.855 --> 00:50:41.917]  And again, people keep calling in going, what's your website?
[00:50:41.937 --> 00:50:43.438]  I know I give it out a lot, but people miss it.
[00:50:43.478 --> 00:50:50.062]  It's prisonplanet.com, infowars.com, infowars.net, and prisonplanet.tv.
[00:50:50.142 --> 00:50:51.143]  Why so many websites?
[00:50:51.363 --> 00:50:56.187]  Because we've got different webmasters for them, and so we have some different information on each site.
[00:50:56.827 --> 00:51:00.069]  We've got more minds working on fighting the New World Order.
[00:51:02.231 --> 00:51:05.093]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:07.101]  Alex Jones here, America.
[00:51:07.301 --> 00:51:13.063]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest, most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[00:51:13.323 --> 00:51:18.564]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction solution.
[00:51:18.865 --> 00:51:22.986]  Brace yourselves as the New World Order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[00:51:23.166 --> 00:51:38.225]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged, witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips, troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[00:51:38.265 --> 00:51:40.107]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[00:51:40.467 --> 00:51:40.887]  That's 1-888-2533-139.
[00:51:40.907 --> 00:51:42.988]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[00:51:43.008 --> 00:51:46.110]  You see big brothers afraid of this documentary.
[00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:47.931]  Order today and spread the word.
[00:51:47.991 --> 00:51:49.932]  America's future depends on the truth getting out.
[00:52:01.815 --> 00:52:04.816]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[00:52:05.176 --> 00:52:13.979]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[00:52:14.319 --> 00:52:18.981]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:52:19.461 --> 00:52:26.183]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:52:26.563 --> 00:52:38.367]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:52:38.827 --> 00:52:43.289]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[00:52:43.469 --> 00:52:45.909]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[00:54:03.918 --> 00:54:09.949]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:54:10.551 --> 00:54:13.516]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:54:15.848 --> 00:54:19.952]  Jim and Jim and JR and everybody else, your calls are coming up here momentarily.
[00:54:19.972 --> 00:54:20.932]  1-800-259-9231.
[00:54:23.695 --> 00:54:27.999]  When I start the next hour, I'm going to spend about 10-15 minutes on more news.
[00:54:28.599 --> 00:54:30.781]  Then we'll plunge straight back into your calls.
[00:54:30.821 --> 00:54:31.742]  But I do want to get into...
[00:54:33.149 --> 00:54:38.793]  Crude oil prices surged past $55 a barrel with no end in sight, and some of the new terror alerts.
[00:54:38.873 --> 00:54:40.574]  There's just a lot coming up, so stay with us.
[00:54:41.295 --> 00:54:43.817]  Let's talk to Tim in Kansas City, Missouri.
[00:54:44.117 --> 00:54:45.498]  Tim, good to have you on board with us.
[00:54:45.678 --> 00:54:46.919]  How are you doing this morning, Alex?
[00:54:46.999 --> 00:54:47.279]  Good.
[00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:49.341]  Back to the children issue.
[00:54:49.621 --> 00:54:54.184]  I'm a chairperson for Head Start here in Kansas City, Missouri for parent policymaking.
[00:54:55.167 --> 00:54:57.309]  Apparently parents are supposed to make policy.
[00:54:57.449 --> 00:54:59.430]  But I just ran into a problem this morning.
[00:54:59.510 --> 00:55:08.256]  Apparently the federal government and the Missouri state government has passed a law mandating invasive procedures to be done to your children to be able to teach them reading, writing, and arithmetic.
[00:55:08.896 --> 00:55:14.880]  Things like white and red blood cell count and a dental examination is required for them to be able to sit in class.
[00:55:14.980 --> 00:55:18.563]  I've already gone through all the administration and the KCMC Corporation this morning.
[00:55:19.073 --> 00:55:22.634]  They're going to be sending me the laws, and I'm going to sit over and write a statement of refusal.
[00:55:23.394 --> 00:55:26.175]  You should never put your child in Head Start.
[00:55:26.535 --> 00:55:35.258]  It's a Head Start getting them into the prison system, a Head Start getting them into the psychiatric system, a Head Start getting them into the welfare system to be wards of the state.
[00:55:35.618 --> 00:55:39.979]  I have the actual federal plans, sir.
[00:55:40.239 --> 00:55:41.199]  I understand that.
[00:55:41.239 --> 00:55:42.180]  There is a leg in.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:47.001]  See, us as parents are able to go down there and complain at the statehouse and also set policy for our children.
[00:55:47.782 --> 00:55:48.603]  I understand.
[00:55:48.623 --> 00:55:49.784]  Let me break this down.
[00:55:50.205 --> 00:55:59.137]  Did you know that every Head Start child now gets three yearly CPS visits where they're looking for something to grab your children or force them onto drugs?
[00:55:59.237 --> 00:56:01.780]  Well, they don't have any right to come in my door, period.
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:04.504]  Well, they claim, though, that when you sign the agreement...
[00:56:05.544 --> 00:56:09.106]  And again, they take their blood, they're going to do psychological tests.
[00:56:09.426 --> 00:56:12.527]  It's now going to be in all the schools, period, by the way, not just Head Start.
[00:56:12.607 --> 00:56:18.429]  I'm sorry, because habeas corpus claims out of state that I am in control of this child's body until he is of 18.
[00:56:18.489 --> 00:56:23.811]  I know, but they argue that it's an extracurricular added value.
[00:56:23.911 --> 00:56:25.992]  Well, then they're going to have a lawsuit, because I'm sorry.
[00:56:26.652 --> 00:56:28.713]  I'm not going to tolerate this.
[00:56:28.753 --> 00:56:31.214]  I'm going to fight this this morning, and I'm bringing it to your attention.
[00:56:31.254 --> 00:56:33.295]  Anybody in the state of Missouri that's listening to you right now...
[00:56:34.642 --> 00:56:38.044]  Like I said, I'm in charge of representing 36 parents and children.
[00:56:38.084 --> 00:56:38.704]  Good job!
[00:56:38.724 --> 00:56:39.484]  I'm not going to stand.
[00:56:39.504 --> 00:56:42.126]  I mean, I'm not going to... They voted me in.
[00:56:42.166 --> 00:56:44.487]  I just went for dinner and everybody there voted me in.
[00:56:44.587 --> 00:56:46.028]  And they go, oh, you know about the law?
[00:56:46.108 --> 00:56:50.610]  Yeah, I know about No Child Left With a Mind Act and all that.
[00:56:51.050 --> 00:56:53.051]  I read law just for, you know...
[00:56:54.324 --> 00:56:54.684]  Yeah, I know.
[00:56:54.804 --> 00:56:56.347]  It just got me irritated this morning.
[00:56:56.367 --> 00:56:58.750]  Like I said, I've had six or seven people on the phone this morning.
[00:56:58.790 --> 00:56:59.912]  I'm not going to tolerate this.
[00:56:59.972 --> 00:57:01.254]  I'm going to read over the law.
[00:57:01.314 --> 00:57:03.998]  I'll sit over and send it to you as tips and info as soon as I get it.
[00:57:04.098 --> 00:57:04.378]  Good.
[00:57:04.899 --> 00:57:07.042]  Well, I want people to know just who Dan is.
[00:57:07.805 --> 00:57:19.777]  I want people to know that just tuned in, Tim, that I'm not exaggerating, I'm not joking, and I'm not saying all the teachers are bad, but they have this program where a nice old lady, a nice lady you can trust, drops by your house a few times a year.
[00:57:20.117 --> 00:57:25.943]  They're openly there to grab children or to get children into the system because the feds set it up
[00:57:26.483 --> 00:57:34.486]  Where the state and local government gets more money for more children, they get into more special ed or psychiatric or problem child areas.
[00:57:34.646 --> 00:57:36.726]  They say it's compliance is the word they use.
[00:57:36.806 --> 00:57:42.568]  Yeah, they say we're complying so we get the funds, and then they try to force you to take your child's blood.
[00:57:42.688 --> 00:57:45.509]  I mean, to go to preschool?
[00:57:45.949 --> 00:57:46.690]  It's asinine.
[00:57:46.710 --> 00:57:51.651]  What does red and white blood count have to do with the communicable diseases of a child sitting in a classroom?
[00:57:51.711 --> 00:57:53.952]  I'm sorry, what does a dental exam have to do with it?
[00:57:54.572 --> 00:57:55.873]  Oh, I'm glad you mentioned that.
[00:57:56.373 --> 00:58:07.776]  In California, what was it, three years ago, the children were all having nightmares in the whole city and complaining about dentists and were totally terrified.
[00:58:07.816 --> 00:58:09.257]  It turned out a mobile truck
[00:58:09.767 --> 00:58:11.549]  And this was admitted in the mainstream news.
[00:58:11.970 --> 00:58:16.015]  Going back from memory, I think the big city it was the worst in was Oakland, Oakland, Oakland.
[00:58:16.516 --> 00:58:19.480]  And they even had the parents on and the newspaper writer on.
[00:58:19.881 --> 00:58:24.607]  They were putting thousands of children through it with these mobile trucks without...
[00:58:26.477 --> 00:58:35.660]  Well, parents better stand up because this is going on now, people.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:38.602]  I mean, this is what they're wanting you to do with your children.
[00:58:38.662 --> 00:58:40.722]  It's getting them into the welfare system, sir!
[00:58:41.043 --> 00:58:46.845]  I mean, who wants a welfare doctor in a mobile dirty truck drilling your child's teeth?
[00:58:47.545 --> 00:58:48.386]  It's a joke!
[00:58:48.466 --> 00:58:49.026]  It's sick!
[00:58:57.572 --> 00:58:58.213]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.893 --> 00:58:59.933]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.653 --> 00:59:01.734]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.414 --> 00:59:03.234]  You want answers?
[00:59:03.994 --> 00:59:04.915]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.555 --> 00:59:09.376]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.736 --> 00:59:13.837]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:16.298 --> 00:59:20.520]  We hear about the New Freedom Initiative that I've been talking so much about.
[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:25.161]  Where every child from 1st grade to the 12th grade
[00:59:27.546 --> 00:59:32.130]  We'll be forcibly psychologically tested twice a year.
[00:59:34.052 --> 00:59:36.034]  Well, I've read the federal rules on it.
[00:59:36.534 --> 00:59:40.037]  With Head Start for your preschoolers, it's three visits a year.
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:51.868]  And we just had a father call in from Kansas City, Tim, who tried to put his child in Head Start thinking, oh, I'm going to give him a Head Start, some preschool.
[00:59:52.882 --> 00:59:53.343]  We're good to go.
[00:59:53.403 --> 00:59:53.783]  We're good to go.
[01:00:13.354 --> 01:00:26.759]  And they've got, Bill Clinton signed into law before he left office, they have to double the number of children they quote, intervene on help, that is put on drugs, put on welfare, or take from the families, each year, if they're going to get their federal funding.
[01:00:27.239 --> 01:00:29.700]  So it's a program that's meant to grow and grow and grow.
[01:00:29.740 --> 01:00:30.780]  People have trouble believing that.
[01:00:31.001 --> 01:00:40.184]  Well now here's Bush, continuing the Clinton program on steroids, expanding it with the new Freedom Initiative, and the plan says, oh we want to forcibly make adults have this.
[01:00:40.544 --> 01:00:41.485]  Well, how are they going to do that?
[01:00:41.585 --> 01:00:44.726]  Well, we've got to defend the infrastructure of the homeland.
[01:00:45.947 --> 01:00:55.352]  We can't have mental ill people working in food service or in agriculture or in transportation or in education or in law enforcement.
[01:00:55.653 --> 01:00:57.994]  They list hundreds of different industries, basically everything.
[01:00:59.398 --> 01:01:11.276]  And so, adults are going to have to have this at least once a year, and your elementary and high school students twice a year, and your little toddlers, your little ones.
[01:01:12.188 --> 01:01:13.069]  You're little tykes.
[01:01:13.729 --> 01:01:14.849]  Three times a year.
[01:01:14.969 --> 01:01:20.592]  And so now you don't have to hear from Alex Jones off a link on my webpage to Head Start's own documents.
[01:01:20.913 --> 01:01:30.658]  Now you can link to the Associated Press and to the Chicago Tribune and to the British Medical Journal and the American Medical Journal and all of it and read about how they're going to do this.
[01:01:30.698 --> 01:01:32.038]  You're all going to be prisoners.
[01:01:33.339 --> 01:01:33.699]  And why?
[01:01:33.759 --> 01:01:34.700]  You didn't comply?
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.622]  If they pull over someone with a dress hanging out of their...
[01:01:39.943 --> 01:01:43.189]  ...trunk, someone beating on it, that's probable cause.
[01:01:44.798 --> 01:01:50.343]  But they still cannot make the would-be serial killer answer questions under the Fifth Amendment.
[01:01:50.803 --> 01:01:56.528]  But you just going to work or going to public school or going to Head Start, oh, you want to help?
[01:01:56.588 --> 01:01:57.429]  You're well-meaning.
[01:01:57.850 --> 01:02:00.412]  And you know the young teacher there who's running the class is well-meaning.
[01:02:00.432 --> 01:02:02.674]  These are just procedures we carry out.
[01:02:02.734 --> 01:02:03.795]  We just do this.
[01:02:03.855 --> 01:02:10.941]  We just get your child into the welfare system, the criminal justice system, the psychiatric system, or just flat out take them from you.
[01:02:12.781 --> 01:02:15.622]  1.5 million children out of their homes on average each year.
[01:02:16.843 --> 01:02:24.706]  My friends, there's only 15 million children in this country at any one time below the age of 12.
[01:02:26.286 --> 01:02:29.750]  Start giving you an idea of just how dangerous this is.
[01:02:30.370 --> 01:02:33.634]  But see, the nightly news only tells you how great this Soviet system is.
[01:02:33.934 --> 01:02:34.935]  How wonderful it is.
[01:02:35.155 --> 01:02:37.498]  Under new freedom, we're not just going to psychologically test you.
[01:02:37.518 --> 01:02:43.184]  15% of you are already on psychotropic drugs or antipsychotics or amphetamine class drugs.
[01:02:43.664 --> 01:03:07.326]  Now we're going to put you on antipsychotics and order you onto drugs because the computer program you were ordered to answer questions to says you're at danger of having some mental illness and they're saying the number will easily be 30% and now your son or daughter goes to school and why they have the psychological test, why don't you put them on drugs, we'll have to arrest you if you don't.
[01:03:09.938 --> 01:03:12.079]  So isn't that just precious, my friends?
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:13.801]  I don't want to spend all day on that when we get back.
[01:03:14.161 --> 01:03:17.203]  Crude oil prices surge past $55 per barrel.
[01:03:18.784 --> 01:03:19.785]  Also, wait a minute.
[01:03:19.845 --> 01:03:21.166]  Aren't we on the same side?
[01:03:21.266 --> 01:03:21.526]  U.S.
[01:03:21.546 --> 01:03:22.526]  News and World Report.
[01:03:22.987 --> 01:03:25.068]  We're hearing that John Ashcroft is going to be leaving.
[01:03:25.789 --> 01:03:27.610]  Oregon trafficking in Baghdad.
[01:03:28.911 --> 01:03:29.111]  U.S.
[01:03:29.131 --> 01:03:30.192]  $30,000 for a kidney.
[01:03:30.692 --> 01:03:34.174]  FBI chief warns of possible terror attack before U.S.
[01:03:34.274 --> 01:03:35.035]  elections.
[01:03:36.096 --> 01:03:38.897]  Also, court terror fears can't curb liberty.
[01:03:38.937 --> 01:03:39.638]  Some good news.
[01:03:40.333 --> 01:03:41.074]  Some bad news.
[01:03:41.134 --> 01:03:42.937]  Scientists find a way to make us slaves.
[01:03:43.398 --> 01:03:44.720]  London Times headline.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:45.561]  Not my headline.
[01:03:46.442 --> 01:03:47.243]  We'll be right back.
[01:03:47.283 --> 01:03:47.784]  Stay with us.
[01:03:55.572 --> 01:04:01.054]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:04:01.474 --> 01:04:05.695]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:04:05.935 --> 01:04:12.977]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:04:13.337 --> 01:04:19.459]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:04:19.599 --> 01:04:20.799]  There are no side effects.
[01:04:20.919 --> 01:04:23.202]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[01:06:01.517 --> 01:06:05.898]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:06:05.938 --> 01:06:07.319]  The New World Order.
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:13.302]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:06:13.362 --> 01:06:20.306]  We rip the Senator Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:06:20.406 --> 01:06:22.487]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:06:22.787 --> 01:06:23.728]  Homeland Security.
[01:06:23.968 --> 01:06:33.232]  Executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:06:33.432 --> 01:06:38.815]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:06:39.295 --> 01:06:41.956]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:06:42.036 --> 01:06:43.217]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:06:43.237 --> 01:06:43.677]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:06:43.757 --> 01:06:45.478]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:06:54.292 --> 01:07:00.316]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:00.917 --> 01:07:03.979]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:10.023 --> 01:07:11.184]  All right, we're back live.
[01:07:11.284 --> 01:07:12.164]  I'm looking at a U.S.
[01:07:12.204 --> 01:07:15.346]  News & World Report article saying that a Bush wins re-election.
[01:07:16.047 --> 01:07:21.711]  Different officials inside the White House are saying that John Ashcroft, a lightning rod for criticism...
[01:07:22.658 --> 01:07:25.640]  We'll probably not be sticking with the team.
[01:07:27.421 --> 01:07:33.886]  Also, a macabre piece of news out of the Asia News Wire.
[01:07:33.986 --> 01:07:36.107]  This says, Oregon trafficking in Baghdad.
[01:07:36.127 --> 01:07:37.688]  You get $30,000 U.S.
[01:07:37.708 --> 01:07:38.009]  for a kidney.
[01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.429]  And it says that...
[01:07:43.977 --> 01:07:44.698]  Need a kidney?
[01:07:44.958 --> 01:07:48.741]  Come to Iraq if you can afford the $30,000 price tag.
[01:07:48.761 --> 01:07:58.610]  Many Algerians are doing just that thanks to a local criminal ring that is bringing patients from North Africa country to Iraq through Jordan for a kidney transplant.
[01:07:58.630 --> 01:08:06.998]  This according to Algerian daily, the paper quotes a member of the Algerian-based Associated Press.
[01:08:08.274 --> 01:08:18.018]  Kidney Patient Support Association who says that it is possible to buy a kidney for an adult or a child for $30,000 to $40,000 U.S.
[01:08:18.098 --> 01:08:27.541]  And it says that, well, Iraq was never really a big center for people selling their organs, but things are so desperate there now that people are.
[01:08:28.260 --> 01:08:39.064]  Imagine somebody bringing their child in to have their kidney taken so you can get that $30,000, $40,000 in a country where you make a couple hundred dollars a month if you're lucky.
[01:08:40.465 --> 01:08:44.306]  FBI chief warns of possible terror attack before the U.S.
[01:08:44.406 --> 01:08:52.009]  election, and it says there is still a possibility that terrorists are plotting to attack the United States before the November 2nd election.
[01:08:52.029 --> 01:08:55.250]  Just in case you forgot, Robert Mueller is out scaremongering.
[01:08:55.810 --> 01:08:57.431]  Director of the FBI said...
[01:08:58.406 --> 01:09:06.950]  He warned on Friday, but he quickly admitted that so far there was no specific intelligence regarding the timing, location, and method of such possible attacks.
[01:09:07.370 --> 01:09:14.433]  Mueller was responding to questions during a background briefing of foreign journalists about the agency in the FBI's headquarters in D.C.
[01:09:15.593 --> 01:09:15.853]  U.S.
[01:09:15.913 --> 01:09:24.357]  authorities have alerted the American public of several occasions this year that intelligence showed terrorists might be plotting to attack the United States before the November election.
[01:09:25.436 --> 01:09:29.181]  I've seen at least several different times at Ridge or Ashcroft or...
[01:09:31.104 --> 01:09:37.288]  Mueller have come out and said it's going to happen, it might happen, it'll be luck if it doesn't happen.
[01:09:37.328 --> 01:09:38.049]  They told the U.S.
[01:09:38.089 --> 01:09:38.869]  Attorney for that.
[01:09:39.429 --> 01:09:40.870]  And again, three months ago, they told U.S.
[01:09:41.231 --> 01:09:46.894]  News & World Report there will be terror attacks, either at the Capitol or coast to coast, or both.
[01:09:47.034 --> 01:09:49.376]  But that one of those things will happen.
[01:09:49.776 --> 01:09:54.059]  And of course, I've been talking a lot about Senator Dayton evacuating from the Capitol.
[01:09:54.499 --> 01:09:58.622]  But bottom line, we have a White House that's been caught issuing fake terror alerts.
[01:09:59.505 --> 01:10:05.269]  It's like Bill Clinton would bomb some aspirin factory when he was caught with his pants down as a political diversion.
[01:10:05.549 --> 01:10:13.094]  Well, the White House, this White House, has been caught red-handed issuing the fake alerts, and that's been in the mainstream news, but again, the back of the paper.
[01:10:14.568 --> 01:10:16.709]  And this is the very definition of terrorism.
[01:10:16.969 --> 01:10:23.991]  It is to threaten violence or engage in violence to scare a population into accepting your political aims, your political demands.
[01:10:24.051 --> 01:10:32.734]  So they say, go along with Homeland Security, go along with Patriot 2 and the new super national ID card, or the terrorists are going to get you.
[01:10:32.774 --> 01:10:35.855]  And then if there is a terror attack, see, you didn't capitulate to us.
[01:10:35.895 --> 01:10:38.796]  You didn't give up all your freedoms, so you caused this to happen.
[01:10:42.047 --> 01:10:42.607]  It's amazing.
[01:10:42.627 --> 01:10:44.608]  So bottom line, this is terrorism.
[01:10:44.708 --> 01:10:49.209]  Whether it's psychological or whether it physically happens, God forbid, it's having basically the same effect.
[01:10:50.909 --> 01:10:52.469]  Very, very serious.
[01:10:53.530 --> 01:10:55.050]  Continuing, though, with some good news.
[01:10:55.090 --> 01:10:57.290]  This is out of the Associated Press in Atlanta.
[01:10:57.770 --> 01:11:02.892]  Fear of a terror attack is not sufficient reason for authorities to search people at a protest.
[01:11:03.252 --> 01:11:08.353]  A federal appeals court has ruled, saying September 11th cannot be the day liberty perished.
[01:11:08.453 --> 01:11:09.653]  That was the court's quote.
[01:11:10.729 --> 01:11:12.589]  September 11th cannot be the day liberty perished.
[01:11:13.130 --> 01:11:14.850]  A three-judge panel of the 11th U.S.
[01:11:14.870 --> 01:11:23.692]  Circuit Court of Appeals ruled unanimously Friday that protesters may not be required to pass through metal detectors when they gather next month for a rally against a U.S.
[01:11:23.752 --> 01:11:26.113]  training academy for Latin American soldiers.
[01:11:27.353 --> 01:11:31.094]  That's the school of the Americas where they trained Saddam and others out of torture.
[01:11:31.673 --> 01:11:34.415]  And then we have to, of course, stop the monsters they've created.
[01:11:34.836 --> 01:11:42.963]  Authorities began using the metal detectors at the annual School of America's protest after the 2001 attacks, but the court found the practice to be unconstitutional.
[01:11:43.623 --> 01:11:57.215]  We cannot simply suspend or restrict civil liberties until the war on terror is over, because the war on terror is unlikely to ever be truly over, Judge Gerald Frogeflatt wrote in the panel's ruling.
[01:11:58.402 --> 01:12:00.323]  And he says, And understand, folks, to get into the city.
[01:12:21.351 --> 01:12:22.972]  That borders the base.
[01:12:23.092 --> 01:12:24.832]  Not to get in the base, but to get into the city.
[01:12:26.293 --> 01:12:28.394]  We've interviewed folks that have been there and seen photos of them.
[01:12:29.014 --> 01:12:30.955]  They set up metal detectors to get into the town.
[01:12:32.315 --> 01:12:42.679]  And, of course, they've had checkpoints all over the country from Kansas to New York, from Texas to California, and they just search your car on the highway and say, well, it's because of heightened terror alert.
[01:12:42.719 --> 01:12:45.960]  And judges say, yes, because of the heightened terror alert we can do this.
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:47.821]  But the border's wide open.
[01:12:49.449 --> 01:12:53.652]  Again, that's like having a castle, and there's enemies at the gates.
[01:12:53.832 --> 01:12:59.817]  The barbarian hordes, the Visigoth chieftains, want to sack your town in northern Italy.
[01:13:00.317 --> 01:13:01.258]  Here's the analogy.
[01:13:02.158 --> 01:13:17.630]  And so you pull the guards off the parapets, you pull the guards off of the marinettes, you pull them off of the drawbridges, and you order them, lower the drawbridge completely,
[01:13:18.593 --> 01:13:27.337]  And then you take your guards and you have them go watch the women and children inside the central city and aim your spear tips at their necks.
[01:13:27.457 --> 01:13:31.578]  And by the way, put a black mask on so your citizens can't see you.
[01:13:32.679 --> 01:13:34.239]  Meanwhile, the drawbridge is down.
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:37.621]  They're pouring across from every corner of the globe.
[01:13:38.441 --> 01:13:42.142]  And they're telling us, the citizens, we've got to have a national ID card to have a job.
[01:13:42.162 --> 01:13:45.764]  And we're going to psychologically test every American.
[01:13:46.750 --> 01:13:50.173]  But the illegal aliens don't even get a tuberculosis test that costs about $15.
[01:13:50.273 --> 01:13:53.796]  It's a swab of the back of their throat.
[01:13:54.537 --> 01:14:00.642]  Whereas the millions that came to this country legally across Ellis Island had tests done on them.
[01:14:00.702 --> 01:14:01.563]  But we don't even do that.
[01:14:01.583 --> 01:14:03.705]  I mean, it's all a fraud!
[01:14:04.545 --> 01:14:09.789]  They'll love it if some copycat Muslim who is an Al-CIA to blow something up.
[01:14:10.110 --> 01:14:11.030]  They won't have to do it.
[01:14:11.050 --> 01:14:12.111]  The globalists won't have to do it.
[01:14:12.752 --> 01:14:15.634]  And they won't even point out that these guys came across our border.
[01:14:15.674 --> 01:14:17.115]  It'll just be, we're taking more of your rights.
[01:14:20.878 --> 01:14:21.939]  Very, very serious.
[01:14:22.019 --> 01:14:33.128]  Columbus Mayor Bob Poysheriff said the city will abide by the order, but called it unreasonable.
[01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:39.471]  And he says, I can't go to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals without being scanned and having my briefcase searched.
[01:14:40.272 --> 01:14:43.013]  They have every right to do that to make sure that they're protected.
[01:14:43.233 --> 01:14:44.293]  You're our lords, yes.
[01:14:44.713 --> 01:14:50.495]  And I have every right to make sure my police are protected and the citizens of the other protesters are protected.
[01:14:51.295 --> 01:14:57.557]  And so the mayor, again, anyone coming into the town has to go through a metal detector.
[01:14:57.577 --> 01:14:58.357]  It's a small town.
[01:14:58.717 --> 01:15:00.858]  So you see how this argument works.
[01:15:01.394 --> 01:15:11.456]  Well, we put up a little machine gun nest, they actually have these in some cities, and cameras and searches at all the courthouses and federal buildings and different government buildings.
[01:15:13.056 --> 01:15:15.017]  What are you here for, the security guard asks you.
[01:15:15.897 --> 01:15:20.898]  When you even go to some little government office, some state office, I'll go to file some paperwork or something, and it's, what are you here for?
[01:15:21.498 --> 01:15:25.599]  Oh, I'm here to file some papers, let's go to the fifth floor.
[01:15:26.815 --> 01:15:27.335]  Let me see.
[01:15:27.375 --> 01:15:29.095]  Let me call and make sure you're authorized.
[01:15:29.135 --> 01:15:39.638]  And you're just sitting there going, it's some security guard with a gun, bugging their eyes out at you, and then a couple federal protective detail guys walk out and start looking at you.
[01:15:40.118 --> 01:15:40.798]  It's amazing.
[01:15:41.038 --> 01:15:42.018]  But the border's wide open.
[01:15:42.658 --> 01:15:45.419]  And so see, now it's, oh, we've got to have this on the street corners.
[01:15:45.479 --> 01:15:47.079]  Oh, we've got to have this to get in the mall.
[01:15:47.479 --> 01:15:49.300]  Governor Ridge, what, about six months ago?
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:52.880]  We actually played that NBC News clip here.
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:55.441]  Well, we need these in the malls now.
[01:15:55.541 --> 01:15:56.221]  Yes, big...
[01:15:57.368 --> 01:16:13.981]  Uh, metal detectors that, uh, but these are new high-tech ones that pick up large metal objects, and then we don't automatically screen you, but the camera then flags you, and we might have to search you coming into the mall, and, well, going into parking garages, we may have to do this, and see it's a whole new industry.
[01:16:14.001 --> 01:16:20.807]  We'll have to double the security guards, so all these companies love it, and they have to be Pinkerton and others who've been serving the New World Order forever, and
[01:16:21.736 --> 01:16:29.222]  It's like cops, when they pull you over for the last ten years, say, roll down your window, please, give me your license and registration, mind if I search the car?
[01:16:29.582 --> 01:16:31.303]  Well, no, officer, I don't want you to search it.
[01:16:31.323 --> 01:16:32.384]  Well, what do you have to hide?
[01:16:33.144 --> 01:16:36.267]  Most people go, well, nothing, but, I mean, well, then let me do it.
[01:16:36.607 --> 01:16:44.893]  Well, I say, well, I plan to have my children grow up in a free country, and I have a Fourth Amendment officer, and, you know, what did you pull me over for?
[01:16:44.913 --> 01:16:46.194]  Do you suspect me of something?
[01:16:46.986 --> 01:16:48.827]  Well, do you have any guns or drugs in there?
[01:16:49.007 --> 01:16:51.068]  Well, it is Texas.
[01:16:51.128 --> 01:16:54.350]  If I wanted to have a rifle or shotgun, I could, but no, I don't.
[01:16:54.890 --> 01:16:55.571]  Get out of the car!
[01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:56.271]  Get out of the car!
[01:16:57.072 --> 01:16:59.713]  Well, go ahead and call your drug dog, because I'm not going to let you.
[01:17:01.954 --> 01:17:02.895]  This is amazing.
[01:17:04.055 --> 01:17:05.676]  Well, see, what do you have to hide?
[01:17:05.716 --> 01:17:13.901]  Well, now, from Louisiana to Arizona to Texas to Vermont, and these articles every week, to Dallas, Texas...
[01:17:15.589 --> 01:17:16.589]  Usually during the middle of the day.
[01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:18.410]  Ma'am, how you doing?
[01:17:18.450 --> 01:17:19.451]  I'm doing a knock and talk.
[01:17:19.471 --> 01:17:20.171]  Just getting to know you.
[01:17:20.471 --> 01:17:21.131]  Well, that's fine.
[01:17:21.151 --> 01:17:21.731]  Thank you, officer.
[01:17:21.751 --> 01:17:22.452]  Would you like something?
[01:17:22.952 --> 01:17:23.492]  Well, yes.
[01:17:23.672 --> 01:17:25.813]  I'd like to... What kind of guns do you have?
[01:17:26.553 --> 01:17:28.054]  Well, sure.
[01:17:28.494 --> 01:17:29.455]  Does your husband have guns?
[01:17:29.595 --> 01:17:30.695]  Well, we... Sure.
[01:17:31.115 --> 01:17:33.016]  Most people... This has been the Dallas Morning News.
[01:17:33.276 --> 01:17:33.796]  It's a good thing.
[01:17:34.797 --> 01:17:35.397]  Go ahead and...
[01:17:37.134 --> 01:17:37.715]  Well, yes.
[01:17:37.855 --> 01:17:39.136]  Well, mind if I come in and inspect them?
[01:17:39.176 --> 01:17:39.676]  Well, why?
[01:17:39.716 --> 01:17:40.917]  Just making sure they're legal, ma'am.
[01:17:41.457 --> 01:17:45.960]  And they let people into their house in Dallas, Texas, where I was born.
[01:17:46.901 --> 01:17:50.803]  And they actually just cops down the street searching houses.
[01:17:50.884 --> 01:17:51.704]  Oh, this is illegal.
[01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:54.566]  I'm going to have to arrest your husband.
[01:17:54.586 --> 01:17:55.967]  They go to the work and they arrest him.
[01:17:55.987 --> 01:17:57.088]  You have a fully auto.
[01:17:57.588 --> 01:17:58.309]  See, it works.
[01:17:58.389 --> 01:17:59.389]  What do you have to hide?
[01:17:59.710 --> 01:18:00.470]  What do you have to hide?
[01:18:00.510 --> 01:18:02.211]  Hey, what do you got to hide in your car?
[01:18:02.391 --> 01:18:03.572]  What do you got to hide in your house?
[01:18:03.752 --> 01:18:04.833]  You want to come in our town?
[01:18:04.853 --> 01:18:06.094]  You got to go through a metal detector.
[01:18:08.644 --> 01:18:11.925]  And now the new driver's license is going to have a powerful RFID embedded in it.
[01:18:11.945 --> 01:18:15.365]  They're about to make that law, and it can be read from 200 feet away as you drive around.
[01:18:15.605 --> 01:18:19.766]  No need for a transponder in the car to tax and trace you on your new toll roads.
[01:18:19.966 --> 01:18:26.028]  And see, everything has multi-dueled uses to track you, to tax you, to trace you, to control you.
[01:18:26.048 --> 01:18:28.968]  I mean, is that freedom?
[01:18:29.028 --> 01:18:32.409]  Psychologically testing all the children, now all the adults, forcibly?
[01:18:34.509 --> 01:18:35.249]  And see the argument?
[01:18:37.230 --> 01:18:38.030]  All right, we're going to...
[01:18:40.023 --> 01:18:41.064]  Come back, go to more calls.
[01:18:41.104 --> 01:18:43.886]  Then, scientists find a way to make us slaves.
[01:18:44.327 --> 01:18:45.348]  That's the Times of London.
[01:18:45.368 --> 01:18:46.088]  Don't want to miss this.
[01:18:47.770 --> 01:18:50.172]  New race-specific bioweapons articles as well.
[01:18:50.572 --> 01:18:51.493]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:18:51.613 --> 01:18:52.033]  Stay with us.
[01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:56.821]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:18:57.061 --> 01:19:00.581]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.

[01:19:04.822 --> 01:19:11.003]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:19:11.403 --> 01:19:19.305]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:19:19.745 --> 01:19:25.070]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:19:25.230 --> 01:19:28.994]  Get the Black Berkey filter elements, leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.

[01:19:52.449 --> 01:19:54.811]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:19:55.072 --> 01:19:58.916]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:19:59.236 --> 01:20:00.057]  Read the labels.
[01:20:00.477 --> 01:20:04.581]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:20:04.821 --> 01:20:09.026]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:20:09.386 --> 01:20:14.271]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:20:14.631 --> 01:20:18.233]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:20:18.413 --> 01:20:23.755]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:20:24.035 --> 01:20:26.756]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:20:27.036 --> 01:20:27.956]  So what are you waiting for?

[01:20:53.372 --> 01:20:55.174]  Jack Brownrigg for Midas Resources.
[01:20:55.654 --> 01:20:59.077]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:20:59.598 --> 01:21:00.258]  Let's update.
[01:21:00.778 --> 01:21:05.502]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:21:06.143 --> 01:21:08.525]  The NASDAQ in that same time frame is flat.
[01:21:09.258 --> 01:21:10.218]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[01:21:10.238 --> 01:21:12.559]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[01:21:13.079 --> 01:21:13.999]  Today, the U.S.
[01:21:14.019 --> 01:21:16.239]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:18.160]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:20.720]  January of 2002, gold spot was 283.
[01:21:22.081 --> 01:21:26.942]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:21:27.942 --> 01:21:28.682]  Gold is moving.
[01:21:28.942 --> 01:21:30.082]  Equities are treading water.
[01:21:30.502 --> 01:21:33.043]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:21:33.695 --> 01:21:35.056]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:21:35.497 --> 01:21:37.218]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:21:37.639 --> 01:21:39.601]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[01:21:40.001 --> 01:21:41.442]  Call Midas Resources today.
[01:21:41.462 --> 01:21:45.126]  800-686-2237 Protect yourself.
[01:21:45.386 --> 01:21:46.447]  Protect your loved ones.
[01:21:46.827 --> 01:21:47.128]  Call 800-686-2237
[01:21:51.792 --> 01:21:55.477]  You've heard about PAWS from BioOx International and its Bubble Up Technology.
[01:21:55.778 --> 01:22:00.064]  But have you heard about BioOx Citrus Concentrate that also uses Bubble Up Technology?
[01:22:00.305 --> 01:22:07.235]  BioOx Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[01:22:07.615 --> 01:22:14.258]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds, your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[01:22:14.578 --> 01:22:18.039]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with BioWalk Citrus Concentrate.
[01:22:18.199 --> 01:22:18.859]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioWalk.com.
[01:22:23.161 --> 01:22:30.325]  Bubble Up Technology is part of the reason BioOx International will guarantee you will have a cleaner and healthier home after using BioOx Citrus Concentrate.
[01:22:30.385 --> 01:22:37.069]  You can throw out all those bottles of harmful cleaning chemicals because it's just better to use BioOx Citrus Concentrate to clean your home.
[01:22:37.289 --> 01:22:41.972]  Call 877-289-7297 or visit BioOx.com.
[01:22:42.152 --> 01:22:44.693]  That's B-I-O-O-X dot com.
[01:22:44.833 --> 01:22:49.476]  When you see the difference, you'll know why it's just better to use the BioOx family of products.
[01:23:03.757 --> 01:23:09.021]  You're right smack dab in the middle of this Monday, October 18, 2004 edition.
[01:23:09.721 --> 01:23:10.862]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:23:10.882 --> 01:23:11.903]  Again, thanks for joining us.
[01:23:14.305 --> 01:23:21.690]  I mean, most of what we talk about is mainstream news, but it's all put in this wonderful light, all the things they're doing, how it's so good for us.
[01:23:24.832 --> 01:23:32.678]  And we simply ask you the question, is all this different machinations and tyrannical activities, is this something you think is good?
[01:23:34.685 --> 01:23:45.949]  And the resounding, overwhelming answer, not just on my own broadcast, but everybody else's broadcast I do, on shows where the hosts are attacking me, almost everybody calls in and agrees with me.
[01:23:46.589 --> 01:23:47.250]  Why is that?
[01:23:48.610 --> 01:23:50.911]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:23:50.951 --> 01:23:57.814]  Let's talk to Jim in Wisconsin, then J.R., Bob, Troy, Nolan, and others.
[01:23:57.874 --> 01:23:58.874]  Go ahead, Jim.
[01:23:59.394 --> 01:23:59.994]  Hello, Alex.
[01:24:00.074 --> 01:24:01.615]  It's great to be able to talk to you.
[01:24:02.279 --> 01:24:07.663]  And, you know, it is hard to find the light to find out what exactly is going on.
[01:24:08.203 --> 01:24:15.067]  There's so much subterfuge and there's personalities out there that are authors and stuff like that.
[01:24:15.107 --> 01:24:22.272]  It's hard to discern what's right and wrong with different authors like Noam Chomsky.
[01:24:23.353 --> 01:24:28.536]  You know, he was on C-SPAN yesterday and he was showing how all the U.S.
[01:24:28.616 --> 01:24:29.917]  military was garrisoned around
[01:24:30.563 --> 01:24:31.744]  Well, that's totally true.
[01:24:31.784 --> 01:24:38.086]  The Pentagon and their minions with their new map admit that that's the plan.
[01:24:38.107 --> 01:24:41.368]  The PNAC documents written by the Vice President and Jeb Bush admit this.
[01:24:55.166 --> 01:25:04.418]  But the problem with Noam Chomsky is he gives you a false solution, a UN-run world government to stop the evil maniacs in America.
[01:25:04.698 --> 01:25:12.909]  Well, the so-called evil maniacs in America are nothing but attack dogs for the UN and its private owners that are using us for their dirty work.
[01:25:14.306 --> 01:25:15.207]  What do you mean?
[01:25:15.307 --> 01:25:16.687]  You can glean something.
[01:25:16.727 --> 01:25:18.288]  You can glean some true thought of it.
[01:25:18.989 --> 01:25:19.229]  Oh, no.
[01:25:19.289 --> 01:25:30.055]  Noam Chomsky tells the truth about manipulations in the media and how the globalists operate, but then he says that it's all America's doing and that it's a group of right-wingers in America.
[01:25:30.335 --> 01:25:30.935]  No, it's not.
[01:25:31.436 --> 01:25:34.377]  It's a group of globalists controlling Europe and the U.S.
[01:25:34.437 --> 01:25:36.739]  and controlling the false left-right debate.
[01:25:37.179 --> 01:25:40.101]  So people go hear Noam Chomsky and think, oh, the U.N.
[01:25:40.141 --> 01:25:40.821]  will save me.
[01:25:41.494 --> 01:25:42.695]  What about Lyndon LaRouche?
[01:25:43.016 --> 01:25:45.258]  Does he have any... He does the exact same thing.
[01:25:46.599 --> 01:25:48.240]  And what do you think of Ramsey Clark?
[01:25:48.260 --> 01:25:50.903]  Do you think he's a patriot, or has he got an agenda?
[01:25:52.164 --> 01:25:54.266]  I think Ramsey Clark is well-meaning.
[01:25:54.346 --> 01:25:54.806]  I've met him.
[01:25:54.906 --> 01:25:55.427]  I know him.
[01:25:57.169 --> 01:26:00.271]  He's been great on some issues, like Iraq and like Waco.
[01:26:00.572 --> 01:26:06.317]  He is horrible on the Second Amendment, and I really think he believes his own worldview.
[01:26:06.357 --> 01:26:06.958]  Thanks for the call.
[01:26:07.178 --> 01:26:07.378]  Thank you.
[01:26:07.774 --> 01:26:10.677]  I think what Ramsey Clark did for civil rights and things is good.
[01:26:10.717 --> 01:26:13.239]  I mean, I don't think black people should be slaves.
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:17.423]  I agree with things like that, but I don't agree with some of the other things that Mr. Clark does.
[01:26:18.524 --> 01:26:21.106]  Let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:26:21.266 --> 01:26:21.847]  J.R.
[01:26:21.947 --> 01:26:22.567]  in Texas.
[01:26:23.188 --> 01:26:24.689]  J.R., how is Sue Ellen?
[01:26:25.550 --> 01:26:26.031]  Sue Ellen?
[01:26:26.511 --> 01:26:27.051]  It's a joke.
[01:26:29.274 --> 01:26:33.637]  I had a couple of points mentioned about 9-11 and Ground Zero.
[01:26:33.858 --> 01:26:34.138]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:34.706 --> 01:26:35.027]  Yes, sir.
[01:26:35.268 --> 01:26:37.534]  I don't know if you were aware of this information or not, Alex.
[01:26:39.488 --> 01:26:45.091]  First of all, I don't know if you've seen the final plans that they have for Ground Zero for the new Freedom Tower.
[01:26:45.491 --> 01:26:48.633]  Yeah, they've already finished the new Building 7 that's out today.
[01:26:48.713 --> 01:26:49.354]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:26:49.634 --> 01:26:55.957]  And I was just there as they were finishing it a month ago, and again, it's so far away from the towers and the rest of the complex.
[01:26:56.017 --> 01:27:07.824]  Little bitty buildings owned by other people weren't damaged or were lightly damaged, but this one that he owns, all the buildings he owns magically implode perfectly, and then he gets out on the news and says they blew it up and people ignore it.
[01:27:08.359 --> 01:27:16.022]  Well I don't know if you've seen the image on 9-11 of the north tower collapse just after the tower collapsed.
[01:27:16.102 --> 01:27:16.322]  Yes.
[01:27:16.602 --> 01:27:28.566]  There was about a 60-70 story tall spiky piece of large debris from the outer wall that was on the northwest corner of ground zero standing up just for several seconds.
[01:27:30.655 --> 01:27:36.636]  It basically looks just like Freedom Tower, like the new Freedom Tower they have proposed.
[01:27:36.896 --> 01:27:41.177]  Well, I mean, that's what buildings look like when they fall apart, is spikes and spires.
[01:27:41.217 --> 01:27:43.637]  But, yeah, the new Freedom Tower is a big spike.
[01:27:43.698 --> 01:27:52.319]  It's in the same part of the bathtub of Ground Zero, facing in the same northwesterly direction.
[01:27:53.799 --> 01:27:54.760]  Well, I'll be honest with you.
[01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:56.620]  I think you're reading stuff into that.
[01:27:57.239 --> 01:27:58.360]  I've got pictures that prove it.
[01:27:58.380 --> 01:27:59.020]  I've got lots of pictures.
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:27:59.560]  Well, I mean, yeah.
[01:27:59.621 --> 01:28:01.021]  There's a building that looks like a spike.
[01:28:01.362 --> 01:28:05.824]  You know, part of the building, one of the edges, stayed standing.
[01:28:05.864 --> 01:28:13.249]  And then you see a building that looks like a triangle, too, and you're saying it's some kind of... And they're both facing in the north-westerly direction.
[01:28:13.289 --> 01:28:14.310]  They have the same silhouette.
[01:28:14.690 --> 01:28:16.491]  Well, you know, J.R., let me just tell you something.
[01:28:16.551 --> 01:28:16.731]  Sure.
[01:28:17.071 --> 01:28:18.512]  We have NORAD standing down.
[01:28:18.552 --> 01:28:18.993]  Let's admit it.
[01:28:19.573 --> 01:28:26.097]  We have drills in the morning of 9-11 of simulated hijacked jets being flown to the World Trade Center Pentagon so NORAD would stand down thinking it was a drill.
[01:28:26.607 --> 01:28:29.588]  We have public officials being called and being told not to fly to New York.
[01:28:30.388 --> 01:28:34.229]  We have them flying out at the al-Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan, flying out to bin Laden's here.
[01:28:34.609 --> 01:28:37.649]  You know, all that, 600 points, by the way, that we could totally prove.
[01:28:38.129 --> 01:28:39.990]  I'm not going to focus in on stuff I can't prove.
[01:28:40.670 --> 01:28:41.250]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:43.691 --> 01:28:44.571]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.071 --> 01:28:46.671]  The empire's on the run.

[01:30:53.334 --> 01:30:54.795]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:30:54.995 --> 01:31:02.340]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:07.063]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:31:07.343 --> 01:31:17.169]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:31:17.549 --> 01:31:18.470]  We're good to go.
[01:31:35.968 --> 01:31:37.308]  They railed against the crowd
[01:32:07.140 --> 01:32:10.261]  I'm not trying to spank J.R.
[01:32:10.281 --> 01:32:12.002]  We'll go back to him in here in just a few minutes.
[01:32:12.963 --> 01:32:21.927]  But a lot of people concerning 9-11 focus in on things that can't be proven or let's just say are more esoteric.
[01:32:22.628 --> 01:32:29.391]  Whereas we have this orgy of evidence of government prior knowledge and involvement totally proven up one side and down the other.
[01:32:31.940 --> 01:32:37.104]  And I would challenge folks out there to stay focused on the issues that we can document.
[01:32:37.144 --> 01:32:46.772]  But before I go back to JR and Bob and Troy and Nolan and many others and then a bunch of other news, I wanted to briefly plug a couple of things that are really, really important.
[01:32:47.569 --> 01:32:54.734]  Number one, Ready Reserve Foods has gained the reputation of providing virtually the finest dehydrated storable foods available.
[01:32:55.174 --> 01:32:58.056]  I've ordered a year's supply from them for two people.
[01:32:58.137 --> 01:32:59.157]  I'm very happy with it.
[01:32:59.638 --> 01:33:04.841]  Perhaps that's why they are the oldest continually operated dehydrated food company in the United States.
[01:33:05.462 --> 01:33:12.687]  Food units need no refrigeration because they are nitrogen-packed, which vastly extends their shelf life to over ten years.
[01:33:13.436 --> 01:33:17.739]  The units are compact and can be customized to fit your individual needs.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:22.783]  They got a month supply, two month supplies, six month supplies, year supplies.
[01:33:23.610 --> 01:33:26.131]  Now, they got deals with the free shipping right now.
[01:33:26.191 --> 01:33:28.292]  They got deals with, you know, 20% off.
[01:33:28.852 --> 01:33:33.915]  You need to just call and hear about these different specials for yourself or ask for a catalog.
[01:33:34.515 --> 01:33:43.179]  It's just a good insurance policy to have a couple firearms and some ammo, to have some gold, to have water filters, to have some portable foods.
[01:33:43.852 --> 01:33:53.661]  I mean, the government stores foods and has water filters and has, you know, stored firearms in case there's a collapse or a nuke goes off or there's another depression.
[01:33:54.582 --> 01:33:58.265]  A lot of people starved in the first depression, the last depression.
[01:33:58.666 --> 01:34:00.007]  I mean, think what will happen today.
[01:34:00.107 --> 01:34:01.288]  I'm not saying that's going to happen.
[01:34:01.883 --> 01:34:14.314]  But it's just a good insurance policy to have, and in three or four years, if bad stuff doesn't happen, I hope it doesn't happen, by getting the truth out, we may back the globalist off, it may not happen, you can eat your investment, which is delicious.
[01:34:14.834 --> 01:34:21.180]  And it's all grown and put together right here in America, except for the banana slices.
[01:34:22.161 --> 01:34:25.804]  The dehydrated banana slices, bananas, just don't grow here, folks.
[01:34:26.044 --> 01:34:26.905]  They don't grow well here.
[01:34:27.914 --> 01:34:30.817]  So give them a call right now, 1-800-453-2202.
[01:34:30.857 --> 01:34:31.077]  That's 1-800-453-2202.
[01:34:31.097 --> 01:34:32.779]  Or go to ReadyReserveFoods.com.
[01:34:32.819 --> 01:34:37.283]  Be sure in the comments section, tell them it's an Alex Jones special you want, and order there.
[01:34:37.303 --> 01:34:40.146]  Or call toll-free 1-800-453-2202 and ask about the different specials.
[01:34:53.684 --> 01:34:54.144]  All right.
[01:34:54.965 --> 01:35:00.867]  Going back to your phone calls, let's go ahead and talk to J.R.
[01:35:00.947 --> 01:35:01.527]  J.R.?
[01:35:01.547 --> 01:35:02.948]  Hello?
[01:35:03.308 --> 01:35:03.568]  Yes.
[01:35:03.728 --> 01:35:05.268]  How long have you been listening to this show?
[01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:15.052]  Oh, I've been listening, well, to this show for about a couple years now, and I've been listening, you know, watching your show on TV since about 98 or so.
[01:35:15.592 --> 01:35:15.932]  Okay.
[01:35:16.172 --> 01:35:20.434]  I mean, the reason I ask that is that you've heard me and you've seen my films.
[01:35:20.494 --> 01:35:21.795]  I've aired them locally on TV.
[01:35:22.135 --> 01:35:22.275]  Yes.
[01:35:24.201 --> 01:35:25.682]  Go over just hundreds.
[01:35:25.722 --> 01:35:40.887]  I mean, I've done radio shows where I don't take a call for three hours, and I read news articles and transcripts and government documents 90 miles an hour for three hours, and I don't cover half of the government prior knowledge involvement evidence.
[01:35:41.047 --> 01:35:44.868]  Stuff that's all totally provable that they cannot avoid.
[01:35:45.168 --> 01:35:47.069]  Their official story is a fraud.
[01:35:48.493 --> 01:35:57.462]  And then you call up and say, part of one of the towers didn't fall, and it looks like a pointed rectangle, just like the new Freedom Tower does.
[01:35:57.482 --> 01:35:59.665]  I mean, what's the point?
[01:35:59.705 --> 01:36:00.806]  I'm trying to understand here.
[01:36:00.986 --> 01:36:08.093]  Oh, well, the point on that is that basically these globalists are trying to erect a monument to what happened that day.
[01:36:08.834 --> 01:36:10.616]  It's basically a monument to the disaster.
[01:36:11.639 --> 01:36:16.343]  Well, so you're saying they're trying to mimic what the jagged ruins look like.
[01:36:16.463 --> 01:36:17.364]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:36:17.404 --> 01:36:18.245]  Now I understand.
[01:36:18.285 --> 01:36:22.708]  I thought you said they blew it up, so that was still standing, and then they built this other thing later.
[01:36:23.029 --> 01:36:23.549]  Oh, no, no.
[01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:26.632]  And one other quick thing I wanted to... Let me just say this.
[01:36:26.712 --> 01:36:29.154]  That makes a little more sense, but I still don't agree with you.
[01:36:29.554 --> 01:36:30.255]  Okay.
[01:36:30.595 --> 01:36:36.240]  This other thing I wanted to say, Alex, was regarding the official explanation of why the towers collapsed.
[01:36:37.026 --> 01:36:38.626]  Well, they admit they blew up Building 7.
[01:36:39.007 --> 01:36:45.308]  I mean, it's like Ted Bundy saying, I committed the murders, and we just go, okay, Mr. Bundy, we'll now give you an award.
[01:36:45.968 --> 01:36:47.449]  Or, yes, Mr. Manson.
[01:36:48.309 --> 01:36:49.069]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:36:49.109 --> 01:36:57.311]  We have the owner of the World Trade Center complex saying on national TV, I've got to play those clips again, that they blew up Building 7.
[01:36:57.731 --> 01:36:58.111]  Go ahead.
[01:36:58.411 --> 01:36:59.712]  Oh, yes, thank you, Alex.
[01:37:00.032 --> 01:37:05.793]  Now, on the computer graphics video that shows how the supposed floor slab
[01:37:06.621 --> 01:37:12.705]  Now, on the video, on the computer graphic, it shows that the floor trusses were these long slabs that were connected, you know, straight across.
[01:37:35.822 --> 01:37:38.265]  Yeah, they claim it was a lattice structure, which is not true.
[01:37:38.585 --> 01:37:38.946]  Exactly.
[01:37:39.406 --> 01:37:46.374]  And the reality is that it was a crisscross grid-type pattern with four inches of concrete poured on top.
[01:37:46.554 --> 01:37:50.679]  And there were, what, 16 giant pillars in the central area.
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:53.562]  About 47 internal support columns.
[01:37:53.602 --> 01:37:55.124]  But the big, super-massive ones.
[01:37:55.805 --> 01:37:56.606]  Let me dig it out here.
[01:37:57.546 --> 01:37:58.347]  Go ahead and keep talking.
[01:37:58.547 --> 01:38:02.389]  Oh, yeah, and I was just shocked that they would put something out like that.
[01:38:02.429 --> 01:38:03.009]  Well, that's right.
[01:38:03.049 --> 01:38:16.878]  We have publicly for major universities, because this thing was studied by architecture students, we have the admitted floor plan, and then on NOVA and on Discovery Channel and all these shows, Why the Towers Fell, they don't show you the real floor plan and lie to you.
[01:38:16.938 --> 01:38:17.998]  Wow, how incredible.
[01:38:18.278 --> 01:38:18.699]  Exactly.
[01:38:19.519 --> 01:38:20.259]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:20.920]  I appreciate it.
[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:22.061]  I appreciate your call.
[01:38:22.101 --> 01:38:24.582]  Look, my point to you is this.
[01:38:24.702 --> 01:38:26.043]  Your time will be better spent
[01:38:26.650 --> 01:38:27.911]  In my opinion, humble opinion.
[01:38:28.491 --> 01:38:29.251]  Take it for what it's worth.
[01:38:29.951 --> 01:38:30.892]  Everybody's got an opinion.
[01:38:31.892 --> 01:38:44.998]  You'd be better spent focusing on public officials being warned not to fly the night before, NORAD standing down the 9-11 drills that morning, of the CIA drilling to do exactly what magically just happened that day at the exact same time.
[01:38:45.238 --> 01:38:45.898]  It's impossible.
[01:38:46.438 --> 01:38:48.239]  If you want to talk about weird symbolism...
[01:38:48.971 --> 01:38:53.053]  The New York Lottery on the 9-11 one-year anniversary came up 9-11.
[01:38:53.333 --> 01:38:56.654]  The Chicago Mercantile came up 9-11.000.
[01:38:57.014 --> 01:38:57.595]  Impossible.
[01:38:57.995 --> 01:39:00.096]  One out of, what, 14 billion something, they said.
[01:39:01.236 --> 01:39:08.299]  All these TV movies and films and newspaper ads where the government blows it up beforehand.
[01:39:08.659 --> 01:39:10.100]  Yeah, that was all out beforehand.
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:15.002]  Blows it up for martial law in movies and TV shows and in news articles.
[01:39:16.523 --> 01:39:21.885]  I was on air saying they were going to blow it up and blame it on their business partner, Bin Laden, two months before 9-11.
[01:39:21.905 --> 01:39:24.126]  Again, those are like five points out of 600.
[01:39:24.446 --> 01:39:27.367]  And perhaps I should do some shows again with the 600 points.
[01:39:27.607 --> 01:39:31.228]  By the way, it's grown from 600 points that we have on PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:39:32.388 --> 01:39:34.089]  That was about a year ago we compiled that.
[01:39:36.110 --> 01:39:41.151]  And everything I said two, three years ago about 9-11 just gets proven more and more true.
[01:39:41.251 --> 01:39:43.432]  It's not like in hindsight I've ever been wrong.
[01:39:44.258 --> 01:39:45.198]  I wish I was wrong.
[01:39:45.758 --> 01:39:47.519]  I have nightmares about this, okay?
[01:39:47.559 --> 01:39:48.659]  I wish this wasn't real.
[01:39:48.899 --> 01:39:50.399]  I wish reality wasn't this way.
[01:39:50.719 --> 01:39:52.479]  But this is really what's going on.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:57.900]  I woke up three times last night, folks, and I sleep like the dead.
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:39:59.901]  I've always slept very hard.
[01:40:00.061 --> 01:40:01.001]  I've been waking up lately.
[01:40:01.041 --> 01:40:06.602]  I just have a great feeling of apprehension.
[01:40:07.302 --> 01:40:09.462]  I can just see all the indicators.
[01:40:09.502 --> 01:40:13.343]  In the years to come, it's going to get worse and worse, and I'm so...
[01:40:14.144 --> 01:40:19.587]  I'm angry at the globalists, but that's outweighed by my love of my family and my country and just basic humanity.
[01:40:20.348 --> 01:40:22.669]  So I don't do what I do because I hate the globalists.
[01:40:22.689 --> 01:40:26.391]  That's minor in comparison to my love of those that I love.
[01:40:26.411 --> 01:40:27.392]  I'm so angry.
[01:40:27.452 --> 01:40:29.873]  I mean, the average person is good and decent.
[01:40:29.893 --> 01:40:34.256]  I mean, they have evil in their lives and we all sin, but we're nothing compared to the globalists.
[01:40:34.276 --> 01:40:42.620]  And I look at all the innocence and just all the sweetness in the world and all the beauty in the world, and then we've got a bunch of demonic scum running things.
[01:40:42.660 --> 01:40:43.361]  I'm sick of it!
[01:40:45.020 --> 01:40:45.440]  You know what?
[01:40:45.561 --> 01:40:46.021]  Hold off.
[01:40:46.041 --> 01:40:47.542]  I'm going to hold off on calls for a second.
[01:40:47.562 --> 01:40:50.445]  We'll go to Bob and Troy and Nolan here in a second.
[01:40:50.685 --> 01:40:52.187]  I've got to get to this news this hour.
[01:40:52.767 --> 01:40:54.309]  Let me cover about five, ten minutes of news.
[01:40:54.329 --> 01:40:55.250]  We'll get to all the callers.
[01:40:55.810 --> 01:40:57.011]  I'm going to go quickly to the calls.
[01:40:57.031 --> 01:40:59.414]  I've been doing that in the first hour, but not so much in the second.
[01:41:00.695 --> 01:41:02.096]  So have your questions or comments ready.
[01:41:02.637 --> 01:41:05.960]  Scientists find way to make us slaves.
[01:41:07.141 --> 01:41:08.422]  This is out of the Times of London.
[01:41:09.904 --> 01:41:10.224]  And again...
[01:41:11.388 --> 01:41:17.794]  I like to take what I see internationally and what's being admitted and give you the microcosm local view.
[01:41:19.175 --> 01:41:26.322]  I happen to be friends with someone at the highest levels of the UT Psychology Department, so I have been allowed into it.
[01:41:27.023 --> 01:41:28.024]  That's all I'm going to say.
[01:41:28.044 --> 01:41:30.146]  I haven't been into classified areas.
[01:41:31.527 --> 01:41:35.571]  Just what I could see that wasn't classified, and about half the buildings classified.
[01:41:37.913 --> 01:41:38.453]  It's admitted.
[01:41:38.713 --> 01:41:48.517]  DARPA documents everywhere, mind control, retina scanners, how to control you, how to manipulate you, and it's all given to the big corporations.
[01:41:49.578 --> 01:41:53.099]  And then across the streets, the biology department, same things going on there.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:42:04.604]  Eisenhower in 1960 talked about how 80 plus percent of university funding was coming out of black projects or dark projects.
[01:42:05.084 --> 01:42:06.265]  Secret black bag ops.
[01:42:09.168 --> 01:42:13.692]  And he said that this was the undue influence, that they were taking over education, taking over the brain trust.
[01:42:13.712 --> 01:42:14.793]  Well, now it's much worse.
[01:42:15.514 --> 01:42:18.076]  Scientists find ways to make us slaves.
[01:42:18.837 --> 01:42:20.558]  Aldous Huxley may have got it right.
[01:42:21.179 --> 01:42:31.288]  In Brave New World, his classic futuristic novel, the author envisioned a society divided into cast from alpha at the top and epsilon at the bottom.
[01:42:31.903 --> 01:42:39.767]  The Epsilons were content to plod on with tedious tasks, their brains numbered and numbed by drugs until now.
[01:42:40.047 --> 01:42:41.468]  This has been the stuff of science fiction.
[01:42:41.508 --> 01:42:52.093]  However, experiments conducted on rhesus monkeys, this is going on at UT by the way, have shown for the first time that animal behavior can be permanently altered.
[01:42:53.793 --> 01:42:55.194]  They have the new vaccine, by the way.
[01:42:56.155 --> 01:43:01.037]  Turning the subjects from aggressive to compliant creatures.
[01:43:02.122 --> 01:43:02.622]  We're good to go.
[01:43:02.642 --> 01:43:02.803]  I think?
[01:43:19.878 --> 01:43:28.204]  Neurobiologist at America's National Institute of Mental Health who has detailed the findings in the Journal of Nature Neuroscience this month.
[01:43:28.544 --> 01:43:35.589]  The work shows how the monkeys could be made to work enthusiastically for long periods without the need for a treat.
[01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:42.755]  The experiments involve getting monkeys to operate levers in response to color changes on screens in front of them.
[01:43:42.815 --> 01:43:48.919]  Normally, they work hardest and fastest with the fewest mistakes if they think a reward for the work is imminent.
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:44:08.107]  However, Richmond's team found that they could make the monkeys work their hardest and fastest after the time without any complaint or sign of slacking just by manipulating D2 so that they forget about the expectation of reward.
[01:44:08.347 --> 01:44:14.709]  Most people are motivated to work hard and well only by the expectation of reward, whether it is for pay
[01:44:16.605 --> 01:44:21.887]  Or to be chic, or a word or phrase, said Richmond, in these experiments.
[01:44:21.927 --> 01:44:28.710]  We found that we could remove that link and create a situation where repetitive hard work would continue without any reward.
[01:44:30.570 --> 01:44:42.135]  And, by the way, they have these same drugs that do this, they claim, for a short time, but some evidence shows permanently, that they're giving special forces troops to stay up for three days and
[01:44:42.937 --> 01:44:43.698]  Do all of this.
[01:44:44.558 --> 01:44:48.141]  New super drugs, as Mr. Marshall talked about it.
[01:44:48.421 --> 01:44:51.583]  Looks like Dr. Evil, the 89-year-old futurist at the Pentagon.
[01:44:52.804 --> 01:44:54.105]  Looks young and spry.
[01:44:54.185 --> 01:44:59.048]  He's enjoying some of the new goodies they've got that we'll never get, by the way, the life extension systems.
[01:44:59.088 --> 01:44:59.849]  But again, I'll continue.
[01:45:00.329 --> 01:45:03.732]  The original purpose of the research was to find ways of treating mental illness.
[01:45:04.152 --> 01:45:11.257]  We make decisions all the time based on how vulnerable we think a reward is and how much time we think it is going to take to get it.
[01:45:11.923 --> 01:45:14.064]  See, we'll all have to have this because we're all mentally ill.
[01:45:14.564 --> 01:45:18.726]  In depression, people think no reward is worthwhile and all work is too burdensome.
[01:45:19.386 --> 01:45:25.009]  In oppressive compulsive disorder, people work and are never satisfied by what they have done.
[01:45:25.029 --> 01:45:29.491]  If we can find the disturbance in the brain... Oh, it's a disturbance.
[01:45:29.631 --> 01:45:30.691]  Some of us are workaholics.
[01:45:30.771 --> 01:45:31.231]  No, it's not.
[01:45:31.391 --> 01:45:34.053]  Some of us are what it's all meant to be.
[01:45:34.613 --> 01:45:36.414]  To be an American, you lazy creatures.
[01:45:37.274 --> 01:45:39.635]  It says if we can find the disturbance in the brain...
[01:45:42.245 --> 01:45:46.856]  And how it's related to emotions and reward, we might be able to relieve these symptoms.
[01:45:46.896 --> 01:45:48.179]  See, it's a wonderful thing.
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:51.808]  However, he and other scientists acknowledge that methods of manipulating human
[01:45:53.050 --> 01:46:01.997]  Physical and psychological traits are just around the corner, and the technology will emerge first as a lucrative add-on available from the IVF clinic.
[01:46:02.117 --> 01:46:06.641]  So you'll have to pay for this, and everyone will want it, of course, and they'll force your children to have it.
[01:46:07.141 --> 01:46:13.807]  Although he added, quote, "...genetically manipulating people to become slaves is not in their interest, but other changes might be.
[01:46:14.287 --> 01:46:17.770]  We have to make choices about what makes a good life for an individual."
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:25.025]  Years ago, Wired Magazine had the big rich owners of major industries bragging about this.
[01:46:25.065 --> 01:46:26.346]  They have old conferences about it.
[01:46:27.607 --> 01:46:34.752]  And they have new virus injections of a live virus, and they're going to make this the law in England.
[01:46:35.013 --> 01:46:45.201]  The vote is pending right now that every child will be given a shot of live mutated super virus, is the quote from the British Medical Journal.
[01:46:46.132 --> 01:47:05.006]  And the live super virus goes in and attacks the neurons at the electrochemical uptake point and creates a plaque that blocks the uptake of opiates, nicotine, and cocaine, a bunch of other drugs.
[01:47:05.046 --> 01:47:06.828]  And of course you can't be happy.
[01:47:06.868 --> 01:47:11.011]  The reason those things make you happy is they mimic naturally occurring chemicals in the brain.
[01:47:11.950 --> 01:47:12.691]  But they don't care.
[01:47:12.791 --> 01:47:14.372]  It's openly Twilight Zone.
[01:47:14.392 --> 01:47:14.992]  Pull your hair out.
[01:47:15.032 --> 01:47:15.693]  Run around screaming.
[01:47:15.713 --> 01:47:16.973]  That would be the normal response.
[01:47:17.554 --> 01:47:19.135]  That would be the normal response to all of this.
[01:47:19.155 --> 01:47:22.077]  I mean, this is insane.
[01:47:22.097 --> 01:47:31.223]  They're openly about to make it a law to make your children take this that sends a virus in that attacks your brain and literally burns out the receptors for happiness.
[01:47:32.003 --> 01:47:32.904]  And they're about to pass it.
[01:47:34.825 --> 01:47:39.188]  I mean, I feel like Woody Woodpecker going, you know, when he goes crazy and jumps around the room.
[01:47:39.228 --> 01:47:39.408]  I mean,
[01:47:41.027 --> 01:47:42.368]  Folks, this is all nuts!
[01:47:43.588 --> 01:47:44.909]  This is all out of control!
[01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:48.091]  And I could spend... You know what happens?
[01:47:48.131 --> 01:47:49.412]  I read these articles too fast.
[01:47:49.452 --> 01:47:50.632]  I kind of babble through them.
[01:47:51.473 --> 01:47:53.934]  But I just want to hurry and get to all the news and take all your calls.
[01:47:53.954 --> 01:47:54.855]  It's very frustrating.
[01:47:56.035 --> 01:47:57.476]  I've gone through about 20 articles.
[01:47:57.536 --> 01:48:01.699]  I've got literally about 80 more that I printed off this weekend I wanted to talk about.
[01:48:01.719 --> 01:48:06.501]  I mean, each one, all the facets, all the connections, all the things that are going on.
[01:48:06.561 --> 01:48:07.582]  I mean, this is incredible!
[01:48:09.955 --> 01:48:11.276]  I'm very angry about this.
[01:48:11.516 --> 01:48:12.936]  I'm very upset about what's happening.
[01:48:15.698 --> 01:48:16.758]  And it just continues.
[01:48:16.798 --> 01:48:18.599]  Maybe later, if I have time, I'll get more into this.
[01:48:18.679 --> 01:48:21.481]  But it's on InfoWars.net.
[01:48:21.541 --> 01:48:25.042]  The only place I saw that we posted this on our websites.
[01:48:26.383 --> 01:48:28.704]  So that's why it's always good to visit the four websites.
[01:48:28.764 --> 01:48:33.186]  InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.net.
[01:48:33.226 --> 01:48:34.387]  Those are the big websites.
[01:48:35.707 --> 01:48:39.109]  They get updated multiple times a day, seven days a week most days.
[01:48:41.039 --> 01:48:42.480]  And most weeks.
[01:48:42.781 --> 01:48:46.724]  And I hope you'll go to Infowars.net so you can read this Times of London article.
[01:48:48.745 --> 01:48:49.646]  Sunday Times of London.
[01:48:49.966 --> 01:48:51.908]  Bob, you were up next, but you just hung up.
[01:48:51.968 --> 01:48:57.432]  So when we get back, we'll go to Troy and Nolan and Kevin and everybody else that is patiently holding.
[01:48:58.013 --> 01:48:59.994]  If you can get back in, Bob, we'll go to you next at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:49:00.014 --> 01:49:02.856]  And then I'll continue into the next hour with calls.
[01:49:02.876 --> 01:49:03.597]  And then I'll get into...
[01:49:09.139 --> 01:49:11.520]  Controversy erupts as voting begins in Florida.
[01:49:11.540 --> 01:49:14.680]  DNC carried ballot collection called unlawful.
[01:49:16.541 --> 01:49:21.142]  Also, Time Magazine is saying it's not true that there's a threat to the Capitol, basically.
[01:49:21.502 --> 01:49:24.603]  Why didn't the other 99 senators close up shop and evacuate?
[01:49:25.643 --> 01:49:28.104]  And Bush's brother rules out bid for the presidency in 08.
[01:49:29.184 --> 01:49:30.964]  Why not make it a hereditary dynasty?
[01:49:31.865 --> 01:49:35.105]  And we'll also talk about that mutiny in Iraq.
[01:49:35.225 --> 01:49:37.786]  One of many, but this one finally broke into the mainstream news.
[01:49:39.525 --> 01:49:42.026]  We'll get into that for you as well.
[01:49:43.127 --> 01:49:44.388]  And just so much more.
[01:49:44.968 --> 01:49:49.511]  New developments with the indie media servers being seized by the EU.
[01:49:50.972 --> 01:49:51.632]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:53.453 --> 01:49:54.995]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:49:55.175 --> 01:49:58.258]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:49:58.398 --> 01:50:02.282]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:50:02.342 --> 01:50:06.586]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[01:50:06.926 --> 01:50:10.710]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:50:10.830 --> 01:50:12.632]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:50:13.454 --> 01:50:16.115]  The police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[01:50:16.175 --> 01:50:20.876]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:50:21.036 --> 01:50:24.097]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:50:24.257 --> 01:50:27.117]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:50:27.617 --> 01:50:33.739]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:50:34.259 --> 01:50:36.101]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[01:50:54.449 --> 01:51:05.715]  Now you can enjoy the most delicious, freshest, and healthiest drinking water anytime, even while traveling, during outdoor sporting activities, and in hospital filtration environments such as local or national emergencies.
[01:51:05.735 --> 01:51:12.379]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[01:51:12.779 --> 01:51:18.442]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[01:51:30.708 --> 01:51:32.890]  Get the Berkey light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:32.910 --> 01:51:35.452]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438, or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[01:51:35.672 --> 01:51:36.313]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:59.492]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:51:59.712 --> 01:52:01.973]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:52:02.153 --> 01:52:08.515]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:52:08.855 --> 01:52:09.516]  We're good to go.
[01:52:24.406 --> 01:52:24.926]  We're good to go.
[01:52:24.946 --> 01:52:25.246]  I think?
[01:52:56.414 --> 01:52:56.894]  Don't worry.
[01:52:57.375 --> 01:52:58.936]  This show is documented.
[01:52:59.416 --> 01:53:02.158]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:02.578 --> 01:53:06.121]  I fell into a burning ring of fire.
[01:53:06.301 --> 01:53:09.643]  I just want to calmly say this.
[01:53:10.544 --> 01:53:12.205]  The British government, and the U.S.
[01:53:12.245 --> 01:53:23.773]  government's also developed it, is openly discussing, the bills are introduced, the legislation is pending, to forcibly inoculate all the children in England against heroin, cocaine,
[01:53:24.506 --> 01:53:25.727]  And nicotine to start off.
[01:53:26.208 --> 01:53:33.054]  And they admit it is a virus that goes in and deposits plaques in the brain.
[01:53:34.956 --> 01:53:36.637]  I mean, the government is, let me say it again.
[01:53:36.957 --> 01:53:37.758]  I just can't get over this.
[01:53:38.479 --> 01:53:44.304]  Openly saying they're going to change our brain chemistry with a live virus and that it's so good for us.
[01:53:45.085 --> 01:53:47.687]  I mean, that's a late night science fiction horror movie.
[01:53:48.688 --> 01:53:50.810]  And everything I cover is like that, but it's admitted.
[01:53:52.159 --> 01:53:57.643]  And now they can engineer these live viruses into eggplants, corn, things we eat.
[01:53:57.683 --> 01:54:02.767]  They go, well, the Africans don't trust our vaccines anymore, so we're engineering them into the foods that we ship.
[01:54:03.087 --> 01:54:07.330]  Then the Africans will starve to death and refuse the food coming off the ships.
[01:54:10.492 --> 01:54:12.053]  They're a lot smarter than we are.
[01:54:12.233 --> 01:54:14.335]  No education, no nothing, most of them over there.
[01:54:15.075 --> 01:54:19.358]  Dying, but they won't take that food because they've already read the documents.
[01:54:19.418 --> 01:54:21.840]  It's already been in their news how the globalists are killing them.
[01:54:22.478 --> 01:54:23.660]  I mean, this is true, folks.
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:24.341]  This is happening.
[01:54:25.662 --> 01:54:26.383]  Oh, my goodness.
[01:54:26.423 --> 01:54:27.405]  This is so amazing.
[01:54:27.585 --> 01:54:28.746]  I mean, how did it get this far?
[01:54:28.766 --> 01:54:29.868]  And they're going to do it to you, cops.
[01:54:30.028 --> 01:54:34.794]  They're going to inject your children with this, too, and I guess you'll just go, well, I work for the state, and I've got to trust the state.
[01:54:35.115 --> 01:54:35.856]  Not that Alex.
[01:54:36.176 --> 01:54:38.559]  I'm not going to go read where they admit it does this to their brains.
[01:54:38.619 --> 01:54:39.741]  I'm just going to believe the government.
[01:54:41.050 --> 01:54:42.451]  It's like here in Austin, Texas.
[01:54:42.991 --> 01:54:49.073]  There's no law that you have to take the vaccines, but all the newscasts and newspapers said it was the law and you better go do it.
[01:54:49.113 --> 01:54:55.475]  And they had 16,000 people line up at a sports stadium over a week before school started getting their shots.
[01:54:55.515 --> 01:55:02.357]  Well, they were going to refuse, but the news said they'd be arrested because they'd be truant and they'd be arrested because they wouldn't let them in school.
[01:55:02.417 --> 01:55:03.698]  I mean, it's just not true.
[01:55:05.598 --> 01:55:08.139]  It's like the local newscast saying you've got to take...
[01:55:12.219 --> 01:55:17.942]  You've got to take the vaccines, and by the way, that thing you heard about Mercury not being good for you, well, that's propaganda.
[01:55:17.982 --> 01:55:20.164]  It's actually nutritious, new study show.
[01:55:20.424 --> 01:55:21.524]  Mercury's good for you.
[01:55:21.584 --> 01:55:23.806]  I mean, do I have to explain how crazy that is?
[01:55:25.507 --> 01:55:29.829]  It's just getting so, it's just amazing.
[01:55:31.050 --> 01:55:34.672]  All right, I promise when we start the next hour, I'm going to just race through calls.
[01:55:35.475 --> 01:55:38.876]  Until Troy and Nolan and Kevin and Robert and Howard.
[01:55:38.896 --> 01:55:44.417]  Until all your calls are done with and then I'll move on to some more news and back into calls.
[01:55:44.457 --> 01:55:46.218]  So have your questions, your comments ready.
[01:55:47.038 --> 01:55:52.740]  Here in the last minute and a half of this hour, I just want to briefly encourage all of you to stand up and be leaders.

[01:57:43.659 --> 01:57:43.939]  Hello!
[01:57:49.802 --> 01:57:52.063]  Big Brother Mainstream Media
[01:57:52.874 --> 01:57:53.954]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.615 --> 01:57:55.475]  You want answers?

[01:57:57.115 --> 01:58:01.716]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.956 --> 01:58:06.058]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:09.879 --> 01:58:16.740]  Less than 14 days away from the 2004 presidential election.
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:18.901]  Don't forget, there's a lot of other elections in your area.
[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:24.065]  That are just as important or more important in the sum total or aggregate.
[01:58:24.966 --> 01:58:26.248]  We are now into the third hour.
[01:58:26.368 --> 01:58:27.629]  I've covered a ton of news.
[01:58:27.689 --> 01:58:31.013]  More news coming up on scientists find a way to make us slaves.
[01:58:31.554 --> 01:58:36.600]  Times of London, new vaccines to re-engineer your brain with a live virus.
[01:58:36.720 --> 01:58:38.623]  And they just say it'll be the law, you'll have to take it.
[01:58:40.043 --> 01:58:41.943]  A bunch of news on new terror alerts.
[01:58:42.624 --> 01:58:43.344]  Your calls.

[01:58:46.084 --> 01:58:47.865]  Troy in Texas, thanks for holding.
[01:58:47.885 --> 01:58:48.525]  You're on the air.
[01:58:49.065 --> 01:58:49.525]  Hello, Alex.
[01:58:49.805 --> 01:58:50.245]  Hello, sir.
[01:58:50.445 --> 01:58:53.226]  I just wanted to tell you really quick how I found out about you.
[01:58:53.326 --> 01:58:55.687]  I have been a hardcore Republican all my life.
[01:58:55.807 --> 01:58:57.267]  I'm 24 years old.
[01:58:57.967 --> 01:59:00.928]  I was watching Fox News one day about three weeks ago.
[01:59:00.948 --> 01:59:03.989]  This is whenever all the eruptions and earthquakes started happening in Mount St.
[01:59:04.029 --> 01:59:04.329]  Helens.
[01:59:05.049 --> 01:59:06.249]  I said, well, that's kind of interesting.
[01:59:06.409 --> 01:59:08.850]  Let me check and see what that volcano in Yellowstone is doing.
[01:59:08.890 --> 01:59:09.510]  So I did that.
[01:59:10.054 --> 01:59:16.095]  I came across a website called North Star Zone ran off of GeoCities and that's how I found out about you.
[01:59:17.516 --> 01:59:31.679]  Since then I've been going to your website every day and the reality is I spent hours and hours reading all kinds of information off your website and the truth, I spent about 30 minutes to an hour in denial of everything that I was reading.
[01:59:32.839 --> 01:59:39.101]  But the more and more proof that I came across, not just from your website but from other places, just totally turned me around 180 degrees.
[01:59:40.459 --> 01:59:42.520]  And let me ask you really quick.
[01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:44.260]  Have you ever heard of Dr. Jack Van Impey?
[01:59:45.061 --> 01:59:45.361]  Yes.
[01:59:45.981 --> 01:59:47.141]  Okay.
[01:59:47.602 --> 01:59:56.165]  About two or three days after I found out about you and all this information, I was still kind of starting to get my feet wet a little bit.
[01:59:56.625 --> 02:00:04.048]  And I was watching his show on TBN, the Trinity Broadcasting Network, and he was talking about the Illuminati, I think is the way you pronounce it.
[02:00:04.348 --> 02:00:05.168]  The Illuminati.
[02:00:05.528 --> 02:00:06.588]  Okay, sorry about that.
[02:00:06.608 --> 02:00:07.909]  I have a hard time pronouncing that word.
[02:00:08.410 --> 02:00:12.273]  But all he did was, he basically validated everything you were saying.
[02:00:12.293 --> 02:00:19.878]  He's been teaching that stuff for years and years, but some things, as far as the 9-11 conspiracy, he doesn't cover for, I think, for obvious reasons.
[02:00:19.898 --> 02:00:23.760]  Well, yeah, that's the problem with Jack Van Emby and Ruxella Van Emby.
[02:00:24.021 --> 02:00:25.141]  Right.
[02:00:25.662 --> 02:00:27.383]  And their film, Revelations.
[02:00:28.152 --> 02:00:30.374]  The guy that does the voiceovers for them.
[02:00:31.155 --> 02:00:38.542]  The problem is, is they tell you about the New World Order, tell you about the RFID chips, tell you about all the plans, which are all just out of the Associated Press.
[02:00:38.802 --> 02:00:42.125]  This stuff's all in plain view, but then George Bush is going to save us.
[02:00:42.626 --> 02:00:42.806]  Right.
[02:00:42.886 --> 02:00:48.171]  Or, you know, again, it's just like Noam Chomsky, John Kerry's going to save us.
[02:00:48.211 --> 02:00:53.776]  They keep you in that false left-right paradigm instead of admitting that the whole system is bankrupt.
[02:00:54.036 --> 02:00:54.697]  Yep, yep.
[02:00:54.977 --> 02:00:56.318]  I totally understand.
[02:00:56.338 --> 02:00:59.680]  But anyway, I just wanted to tell you, I haven't been able to get off your website.
[02:00:59.700 --> 02:01:03.483]  I had to listen to you through the streaming audio on the internet because you're not in Houston.
[02:01:04.003 --> 02:01:11.108]  Yeah, we need to get on the radio in Houston, and that can always happen if folks call their local AM and FM's and say, we want Alex Jones.
[02:01:11.629 --> 02:01:15.291]  They can go to GCNlive.com, and there's a list of the satellites we're on.
[02:01:15.712 --> 02:01:15.892]  Right.
[02:01:15.932 --> 02:01:17.273]  Let me ask you this really quick.
[02:01:19.469 --> 02:01:25.570]  How much money would be involved if somebody was wanting to build a private radio station just as a relay for the GCN?
[02:01:26.430 --> 02:01:28.851]  Yeah, sir, you don't want to... Do that?
[02:01:29.191 --> 02:01:32.452]  Well, I mean, we've got listeners who could buy 100 radio stations.
[02:01:32.912 --> 02:01:39.553]  We've got billionaire radio listeners, but they haven't stepped up yet to buy us a bunch of stations.
[02:01:40.353 --> 02:01:41.633]  But that's actually a good idea.
[02:01:41.693 --> 02:01:45.194]  But believe me, sir, a small radio station would cost you...
[02:01:46.318 --> 02:01:50.462]  A small 1,000 watt AM in the middle of nowhere would cost you half a million bucks.
[02:01:51.082 --> 02:01:51.403]  Okay.
[02:01:51.563 --> 02:01:53.725]  And then tens of thousands a month to run it.
[02:01:54.352 --> 02:01:55.293]  Yeah, okay.
[02:01:55.353 --> 02:01:56.073]  I was just curious.
[02:01:56.133 --> 02:02:00.697]  I mean, I wasn't wanting to get anybody on the radio locally, just be like a relay station.
[02:02:00.957 --> 02:02:15.528]  Oh, if you want to do a micro that's unlicensed, and then they might come grab the equipment from you at Civil, it costs you a couple hundred bucks and a satellite dish or internet feed, and we have hundreds and hundreds of wonderful micro-FMs that are not pirates, folks.
[02:02:15.828 --> 02:02:18.190]  They're known as pirates carrying this show.
[02:02:18.250 --> 02:02:19.371]  I think they're doing a great job.
[02:02:20.003 --> 02:02:21.663]  Well, how would I get information about doing that?
[02:02:21.683 --> 02:02:23.084]  Can I send you an email?
[02:02:23.164 --> 02:02:32.306]  Just type micro-FM equipment or pirate radio into a search engine, and a whole new world will open up for you.
[02:02:32.686 --> 02:02:33.086]  All right.
[02:02:33.106 --> 02:02:34.046]  I appreciate the help, Alex.
[02:02:34.086 --> 02:02:35.146]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[02:02:35.186 --> 02:02:35.666]  Thank you.
[02:02:36.087 --> 02:02:41.948]  We'll come back with more calls quickly on the other side, then back into the stack of vital news and info, prisonplanet.tv.

[02:03:02.002 --> 02:03:06.226]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.

[02:03:26.323 --> 02:03:31.706]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police State 3, is for you.

[02:04:54.432 --> 02:04:57.573]  Since taking new hair, I noticed darker and less gray hair.
[02:04:57.753 --> 02:04:59.133]  My hair is growing phenomenally.
[02:04:59.334 --> 02:05:00.694]  It looks and feels healthier.
[02:05:01.074 --> 02:05:02.535]  I'd strongly recommend new hair.
[02:05:02.635 --> 02:05:08.557]  My husband has been a customer for almost two years now, and we're really, really pleased with the continual hair growth.
[02:05:08.817 --> 02:05:13.581]  I've been using new hair since 1992, and I've experienced fantastic growth.
[02:05:13.782 --> 02:05:14.562]  No more thinning.

[02:05:34.519 --> 02:05:34.559]  800-806-0432.
[02:05:34.599 --> 02:05:35.900]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:35.920 --> 02:05:37.201]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.863 --> 02:06:01.588]  Continuing with your always-ribbiting phone calls that take us in many different directions, let's go ahead and talk to Nolan in Texas.
[02:06:02.028 --> 02:06:02.749]  Nolan, welcome.
[02:06:03.189 --> 02:06:03.609]  Hey, Alex.
[02:06:03.970 --> 02:06:04.250]  Hello.
[02:06:04.570 --> 02:06:06.111]  I'll be as quick as I can.
[02:06:06.151 --> 02:06:07.972]  Give me a few seconds before you bump me off.
[02:06:09.133 --> 02:06:17.198]  An attack I don't believe will come from people who hate George Bush and this country before the election, because they're smart.
[02:06:17.879 --> 02:06:18.399]  They're smart.
[02:06:19.440 --> 02:06:21.561]  If they did what they say they did, they're pretty smart.
[02:06:22.279 --> 02:06:29.573]  And they know that there will be an instant martial law and permanent Bush, and that Congress can't even look at martial law being declared for six months.
[02:06:31.764 --> 02:06:36.665]  If he says martial law today, for six months, Congress can't do a thing about it.
[02:06:36.865 --> 02:06:39.645]  That is the law, but it's totally unconstitutional.
[02:06:39.685 --> 02:06:42.266]  Again, just because they say something's the law doesn't mean it's God.
[02:06:42.286 --> 02:06:45.506]  Hitler says it's the law to kill all the Jews doesn't make it right.
[02:06:45.706 --> 02:06:46.326]  Oh, I know that one.
[02:06:46.346 --> 02:06:47.707]  No, no, I'm saying this for listeners.
[02:06:48.187 --> 02:06:51.407]  Or our law says black people aren't human beings 200 years ago.
[02:06:51.687 --> 02:06:53.288]  That doesn't make it true or right.
[02:06:53.648 --> 02:06:54.948]  But you're right about that.
[02:06:54.968 --> 02:06:56.168]  But let me add something to this.
[02:06:56.768 --> 02:07:00.669]  Again, why would the Arabs finance...
[02:07:01.972 --> 02:07:17.785]  Flying planes into the Pentagon and World Trade Centers, knowing it would bring down the wrath of the New World Order, and then why would Al-Qaeda, if they hate Bush so much, why would they carry out an attack which would only intensify the attack that came down on them?
[02:07:18.145 --> 02:07:19.506]  Now, that's just common sense.
[02:07:19.546 --> 02:07:25.431]  Then you look at who Al-Qaeda is, publicly CIA-created, controlled, funded, operated.
[02:07:25.671 --> 02:07:26.092]  Go ahead.
[02:07:26.492 --> 02:07:30.355]  Are you saying that if I stood you next to a beehive and handed you a stick, you wouldn't hit it?
[02:07:31.926 --> 02:07:32.746]  Gee, I wouldn't either.
[02:07:33.046 --> 02:07:34.347]  And I don't think they did either.
[02:07:34.487 --> 02:07:38.188]  Well, that's why all the Arabs are saying, we didn't do it, we're against them, we're trying to arrest them.
[02:07:38.508 --> 02:07:40.549]  Every time we're about to arrest them, you say don't.
[02:07:40.569 --> 02:07:41.670]  Yeah, I understand.
[02:07:41.690 --> 02:07:43.630]  They work for you, we're not doing it.
[02:07:43.930 --> 02:07:45.951]  I mean, a bunch of these countries have said that.
[02:07:46.491 --> 02:07:48.272]  Look, well, we've got executive orders.
[02:07:48.412 --> 02:07:49.773]  This is not new.
[02:07:49.813 --> 02:07:52.154]  Executive orders have been around for a long time.
[02:07:52.494 --> 02:07:55.295]  But while we have executive orders, we don't need Congress.
[02:07:55.315 --> 02:07:55.935]  We've got a king.
[02:07:57.125 --> 02:08:08.691]  Well, what happens is the president, whether it's Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan or George Bush or any of these people, they sign an order, and an executive order has never been challenged.
[02:08:09.151 --> 02:08:11.552]  As soon as it's written into the Federal Register, it becomes law.
[02:08:11.872 --> 02:08:14.474]  And if it's not challenged in 30 days, it becomes law.
[02:08:15.434 --> 02:08:18.816]  And what did Paul Bogala, who now hosts Crossfire, say?
[02:08:18.856 --> 02:08:20.377]  Stroke of the pen, law of the land.
[02:08:20.737 --> 02:08:21.457]  Kind of cool.
[02:08:22.018 --> 02:08:22.718]  Pretty handy.
[02:08:23.763 --> 02:08:25.284]  I've got a question for you.
[02:08:25.304 --> 02:08:25.945]  Okay, real quick.
[02:08:26.105 --> 02:08:29.487]  Okay, I found this thing about civilian internment camps.
[02:08:29.987 --> 02:08:31.568]  It said there was one in Brand Park.
[02:08:31.608 --> 02:08:37.012]  So I called information, got me a couple of numbers in Glendale, California, called and talked to a couple of people.
[02:08:37.132 --> 02:08:39.414]  One woman freaked out, panicked, wouldn't talk to me.
[02:08:39.774 --> 02:08:42.516]  The man was rude and maybe wasn't right.
[02:08:42.836 --> 02:08:44.797]  He said he doesn't believe there's such a thing there.
[02:08:44.817 --> 02:08:47.579]  Okay, let me stop you.
[02:08:47.599 --> 02:08:48.480]  Are you talking about...
[02:08:49.139 --> 02:08:51.121]  The document from the Army's own website?
[02:08:51.781 --> 02:08:53.503]  I don't think it was from the Army's website.
[02:08:53.723 --> 02:08:54.844]  See, I don't know what you're looking at.
[02:08:54.964 --> 02:09:01.349]  In my book, Descent into Tyranny, I have the screenshot reprint from the Army's own website with the phone number.
[02:09:02.688 --> 02:09:05.189]  To Yovani Wild Anger.
[02:09:05.209 --> 02:09:05.869]  That's her name.
[02:09:06.269 --> 02:09:07.590]  And you can call the military.
[02:09:08.710 --> 02:09:14.472]  They had 12 civilian inmate labor camps where they used federal labor at military bases where they lived there.
[02:09:15.032 --> 02:09:17.232]  And these are non-military detainees.
[02:09:17.933 --> 02:09:20.473]  And they were classified until 1997.
[02:09:20.614 --> 02:09:23.574]  It was set up in the early 1980s.
[02:09:23.955 --> 02:09:25.215]  And now they've expanded them.
[02:09:26.460 --> 02:09:28.662]  And they admit the internment camp programs.
[02:09:28.722 --> 02:09:30.244]  I mean, they've passed laws.
[02:09:30.344 --> 02:09:31.705]  It's been all over the news.
[02:09:31.825 --> 02:09:33.707]  So I don't know what document you're talking about.
[02:09:33.807 --> 02:09:34.748]  It's okay.
[02:09:34.848 --> 02:09:38.351]  As long as I know that if I tell my wife about this, she can't make me wrong.
[02:09:38.371 --> 02:09:42.775]  Well, there's a lot of concentration camp disinfo out there, but I don't know what document you're talking about.
[02:09:43.075 --> 02:09:43.696]  It doesn't matter.
[02:09:43.796 --> 02:09:45.797]  You've made me comfortable with it.
[02:09:46.158 --> 02:09:46.778]  I'll tell you this.
[02:09:47.039 --> 02:09:48.300]  Well, I don't think that should happen.
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:50.762]  No, I mean, you've made me comfortable with the facts.
[02:09:51.488 --> 02:09:52.329]  Okay.
[02:09:52.489 --> 02:09:53.209]  I'm correct.
[02:09:53.410 --> 02:09:54.070]  Got to let you go.
[02:09:54.110 --> 02:09:54.711]  Thanks for the call.
[02:09:54.751 --> 02:09:55.531]  Got to get to everybody.
[02:09:55.751 --> 02:09:56.612]  Good call, Nolan.
[02:09:56.932 --> 02:09:59.434]  Kevin, you're on the air.
[02:09:59.454 --> 02:10:00.715]  Kevin, where are you calling us from?
[02:10:00.976 --> 02:10:01.956]  I'm calling from Boston.
[02:10:01.976 --> 02:10:03.217]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[02:10:03.538 --> 02:10:03.878]  You bet.
[02:10:04.118 --> 02:10:10.623]  It's my information that FEMA is scheduled for the first time to be on full alert in all states on Election Day and the day before.
[02:10:11.144 --> 02:10:18.970]  And with all the information that you provide, a lot of times listeners ask, what can we do once we become woken up and believe in this information?
[02:10:19.672 --> 02:10:27.634]  As an example, just one of the things I've been up to is I wrote Senator Kennedy, who some people love, some people hate, but I'm a constituent of his.
[02:10:28.594 --> 02:10:31.255]  If I could take about 20 seconds, I just want to read a quick thing.
[02:10:31.915 --> 02:10:35.296]  I think you'll hear where I'm getting my information from yourself.
[02:10:36.136 --> 02:10:48.439]  It says, Dear Senator Kennedy, I am a constituent who called your Boston office yesterday, Thursday, October 14, 2004, to inquire about your reaction to Minnesota Senator Mark Dayton's decision to close his Washington, D.C.
[02:10:48.559 --> 02:10:48.819]  office.
[02:10:49.309 --> 02:10:49.609]  I think so.
[02:11:14.451 --> 02:11:17.093]  Submitted by then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, L.L.
[02:11:17.213 --> 02:11:19.594]  Lemnister, and finally rejected by your heroic brother.
[02:11:20.354 --> 02:11:26.158]  Your staff member then restated my 9-11 position as if to be clear, to which I responded, yes, absolutely.
[02:11:26.618 --> 02:11:30.860]  He then cut my call short as if my position indicated mental imbalance on my part.
[02:11:31.361 --> 02:11:42.167]  I did not get a chance to point out that Stanley Hilton, Senator Bob Dole's former chief of staff, has not only stated the same position, but has initiated a lawsuit against those he believes makes up said criminal elements.
[02:11:42.529 --> 02:11:56.696]  Ray McGovern, Ronald Reagan's former chief CIA liaison officer, has also bravely gone on record and stated not only that our government was complicit in the 9-11 attacks, but that we may soon experience a real or staged terrorist attack in order to postpone the election.
[02:11:57.156 --> 02:12:03.379]  The FEMA Operations 3rd Community Emergency Response Training will culminate with a mock attack drill to respond to.
[02:12:03.559 --> 02:12:07.281]  I find it curious that this mock attack drill is scheduled for Election Day.
[02:12:07.679 --> 02:12:08.500]  Okay, do me a favor.
[02:12:08.520 --> 02:12:09.521]  That's well written.
[02:12:09.541 --> 02:12:10.081]  Email that
[02:12:37.649 --> 02:12:38.970]  Go to prisonplanet.com.
[02:12:38.990 --> 02:12:40.332]  It says email webmaster.
[02:12:40.372 --> 02:12:41.372]  Send it to that address.
[02:12:41.793 --> 02:12:43.034]  I want to post your letter.
[02:12:43.074 --> 02:12:43.815]  That's a great letter.
[02:12:44.075 --> 02:12:44.615]  I will do that.
[02:12:45.276 --> 02:12:46.377]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:12:46.617 --> 02:12:48.318]  Hey, I appreciate your call.
[02:12:49.139 --> 02:12:49.920]  Yeah, they do this.
[02:12:50.340 --> 02:12:58.207]  On Election Day, some areas of the country, Florida and New York, are going to have National Guard out at the polling places because it might be a target.
[02:12:59.028 --> 02:13:05.153]  Well, then in those two key battleground states that are up for grabs, now people won't go out and vote because they're afraid.
[02:13:07.466 --> 02:13:09.348]  It's so transparent.
[02:13:10.629 --> 02:13:14.333]  And, yeah, they've got FEMA on total alert.
[02:13:14.353 --> 02:13:15.734]  FEMA's on total alert right now.
[02:13:15.794 --> 02:13:18.998]  From October 1st to November 3rd, they're on total alert.
[02:13:19.478 --> 02:13:24.683]  And the alert extends on out, but supposedly at a lightened level through...
[02:13:30.040 --> 02:13:31.141]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:13:31.221 --> 02:13:34.183]  Glad that you're doing such a great job, and God bless you, sir.
[02:13:56.264 --> 02:14:01.988]  I was wondering, Alex, if you've ever heard of the document called the Hidden Tyranny, the Rosenwald document?
[02:14:02.948 --> 02:14:03.549]  No, I haven't.
[02:14:03.989 --> 02:14:05.490]  Well, you know, I just don't want to recall.
[02:14:05.510 --> 02:14:08.371]  I don't want to take too much of your time because I know you're a busy man and God bless you for doing what you're doing.
[02:14:08.391 --> 02:14:11.673]  But I would advise all patriots and the militia people out there.
[02:14:11.693 --> 02:14:15.836]  I saw you on the militia program last week or so on Country Music Channel.
[02:14:16.176 --> 02:14:16.997]  What did you think of that?
[02:14:17.437 --> 02:14:18.137]  I thought it was great.
[02:14:18.157 --> 02:14:23.481]  I mean, I thought it was just a great, you know, great getting out there.
[02:14:23.581 --> 02:14:25.522]  Okay, I still haven't seen it.
[02:14:27.624 --> 02:14:29.826]  And for some reason they haven't mailed me a copy.
[02:14:30.046 --> 02:14:31.767]  They're supposed to when they interview you.
[02:14:32.448 --> 02:14:33.368]  And I guess they're like me.
[02:14:33.409 --> 02:14:34.029]  They're so busy.
[02:14:34.049 --> 02:14:37.852]  I always have guests asking for stuff and I don't ever send it because I get too busy.
[02:14:37.892 --> 02:14:39.693]  But will somebody mail that to me?
[02:14:42.415 --> 02:14:43.716]  Well, you know, a copy of the video set?
[02:14:43.776 --> 02:14:45.458]  Yeah, well, I'll try to do my best.
[02:14:45.558 --> 02:14:49.601]  And I think it was really great because it just did a totally American public.
[02:14:50.783 --> 02:14:58.446]  Well, I was saying that the production company should have sent me a copy.
[02:14:58.466 --> 02:15:00.867]  I'm not saying you have that obligation, Robert.
[02:15:01.347 --> 02:15:01.968]  Oh, okay.
[02:15:02.008 --> 02:15:05.629]  Well, describe the hour-long special, because I didn't get a chance to see it.
[02:15:05.689 --> 02:15:06.809]  What did I say on there?
[02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:18.674]  Well, basically, you just expelled them on the New World Order and told people that we have a great concern over what's happening to our country, that the threat is real.
[02:15:19.255 --> 02:15:32.125]  And that, you know, basically you said militias were there to, like, you know, as a contingency force to, you know, to, like, stand on the wings in case county, you know, whatever, you know, tried to oppress us beyond the point of no return.
[02:15:32.165 --> 02:15:33.346]  How much was I in the piece?
[02:15:33.406 --> 02:15:34.107]  I'm just curious.
[02:15:35.888 --> 02:15:36.869]  It went back and forth.
[02:15:36.949 --> 02:15:42.433]  You were in, like, it would jump from militia, you know, people talking, and then it would jump back to you.
[02:15:42.473 --> 02:15:45.476]  So I think all told, probably you were in the piece for probably,
[02:15:46.758 --> 02:15:49.123]  Maybe five, six minutes or so.
[02:15:49.364 --> 02:15:50.146]  Well, that's great.
[02:15:50.286 --> 02:15:53.674]  I hope that somebody will mail that to me because...
[02:15:55.163 --> 02:15:57.985]  I've heard it was a pretty fair piece from a lot of callers.
[02:15:58.305 --> 02:15:59.566]  I'm really surprised you don't have it.
[02:15:59.626 --> 02:16:02.647]  I'm just surprised that someone has not mailed it.
[02:16:02.687 --> 02:16:05.349]  Yeah, and I'm so busy, I don't have time to watch much TV.
[02:16:06.149 --> 02:16:09.111]  But I just want to let you know that God bless you.
[02:16:09.131 --> 02:16:14.554]  And I just wanted to let patriots and militia people out there know, because in Connecticut here, we're definitely afraid of martial law.
[02:16:14.594 --> 02:16:21.517]  If you go to page 23, if you can go on your computer and get the hidden tyranny, it's also called the Rosenfall document.
[02:16:21.958 --> 02:16:23.999]  On page 23, it's a very interesting...
[02:16:25.049 --> 02:16:26.110]  You know, what it says on page 23.
[02:16:26.250 --> 02:16:29.331]  It's basically about the pen and the sword.
[02:16:29.591 --> 02:16:47.861]  It's subtitled, the footnote on the bottom of the page, it says, A recurrence to history would edify our minds and show us that the European countries solved their problem not only by the use of the pen, but by the use of force and physical expulsion from their countries.
[02:16:48.501 --> 02:16:51.123]  I'm not going to get into who this document is for.
[02:16:53.328 --> 02:16:57.417]  Well, I would say I'm not anti-Semitic, but it's very interesting if you read page 23.
[02:16:58.897 --> 02:17:04.142]  And it will tell you exactly what the American public needs to do to get these bums out of our government.
[02:17:04.162 --> 02:17:11.408]  And I'm surprised that 260 million people in this country can't get together and just expel these people out of here.
[02:17:11.428 --> 02:17:13.410]  Okay, well, thank you for the call, Robert.
[02:17:13.450 --> 02:17:17.033]  I mean, I do have to say, again, I hadn't heard of this document you're talking about.
[02:17:17.053 --> 02:17:20.476]  There have been pogroms in Europe kicking the Jews out.
[02:17:21.177 --> 02:17:23.159]  And in the histories I've studied...
[02:17:24.085 --> 02:17:25.667]  You know, I mean, it was a scapegoat.
[02:17:25.927 --> 02:17:27.949]  Oh, there's a black plague killing everyone.
[02:17:27.969 --> 02:17:30.331]  You look the Jews in the eyes and you get it.
[02:17:30.371 --> 02:17:31.112]  Let's kill them all.
[02:17:31.573 --> 02:17:32.534]  Are there evil Jews?
[02:17:32.674 --> 02:17:33.294]  Absolutely.
[02:17:33.815 --> 02:17:35.637]  You know, is there organized crime with Jews?
[02:17:35.697 --> 02:17:38.520]  Yes, but there's just as much or more with other groups.
[02:17:38.780 --> 02:17:43.344]  And I'm not trying to go after you here, but I really think, sir, you need to reexamine that.
[02:17:43.645 --> 02:17:44.325]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:44.345 --> 02:17:44.826]  Stay with us.
[02:17:47.313 --> 02:17:48.354]  The war on terrorism.
[02:17:48.674 --> 02:17:51.476]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:17:51.736 --> 02:17:55.899]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:17:57.140]  So what do you do?
[02:17:57.461 --> 02:18:02.024]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:18:02.524 --> 02:18:04.646]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.

[02:19:39.316 --> 02:19:43.698]  You know, for thousands of years, the one true valuable commodity has always been gold.
[02:19:43.738 --> 02:19:44.178]  It still is.

[02:20:45.231 --> 02:20:48.233]  You and your family members getting enough minerals on the daily diet?
[02:20:48.253 --> 02:20:51.135]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:20:51.376 --> 02:20:58.441]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:20:58.641 --> 02:21:01.923]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[02:21:02.183 --> 02:21:04.225]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:21:04.545 --> 02:21:12.371]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:21:12.551 --> 02:21:13.211]  We're good to go.
[02:21:46.594 --> 02:21:51.738]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:52.419 --> 02:21:54.780]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:56.942 --> 02:22:02.646]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation, Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[02:22:02.666 --> 02:22:03.367]  until 2 p.m.
[02:22:03.867 --> 02:22:05.889]  Central Standard Time, back from 9 to midnight.
[02:22:06.969 --> 02:22:12.412]  Howard and John and Mike and Mike and Laura and everybody else, your calls are coming up in the next segment.
[02:22:12.432 --> 02:22:14.013]  I want to continue with some news now.
[02:22:14.934 --> 02:22:16.294]  This is out of the BBC.
[02:22:16.475 --> 02:22:16.815]  U.S.
[02:22:17.355 --> 02:22:18.456]  confirms U.K.
[02:22:18.496 --> 02:22:19.917]  flu jabs unusable.
[02:22:20.737 --> 02:22:24.199]  Now, again, when you read our newspapers, it's, oh, we've only got half the supply we need.
[02:22:24.279 --> 02:22:24.819]  Line up.
[02:22:25.220 --> 02:22:27.041]  It's a crazed dash to get them.
[02:22:29.002 --> 02:22:36.026]  And then the reason we have the shortage of the questionable flu vaccine to begin with is because it had live flu virus in it.
[02:22:37.561 --> 02:22:37.861]  U.S.
[02:22:37.901 --> 02:22:43.003]  health officials have confirmed that the entire stock of flu vaccine from a British producer is unusable.
[02:22:43.023 --> 02:22:43.943]  The U.S.
[02:22:43.963 --> 02:22:52.447]  had hoped to salvage some of the doses made by Chiron, which account for nearly half of its annual supply, but tests have shown contamination.
[02:22:53.247 --> 02:23:01.510]  Officials have been trying to arrange deliveries from other nations, such as Canada, but say it will be hard to get regulators to approve them by winter.
[02:23:04.298 --> 02:23:11.265]  I probably know 20 people personally, and I've met hundreds, who are totally healthy, take the flu shot and are deathly ill for two weeks.
[02:23:12.006 --> 02:23:12.887]  My mother is one of them.
[02:23:13.447 --> 02:23:15.029]  Why would you ever take it?
[02:23:15.329 --> 02:23:16.550]  Because you're afraid of getting the flu?
[02:23:17.111 --> 02:23:23.557]  Folks, this government and the people putting stuff in these flu vaccines, these vaccines, period, could not be trusted to do anything.
[02:23:25.302 --> 02:23:38.929]  Again, they're coming out with vaccines they want to make mandatory that change your brain chemistry so you, quote, can't get addicted to drugs, but then you can't also be happy because it plugs up those receptors and it uses a live virus to reprogram your receptors.
[02:23:39.109 --> 02:23:39.749]  That's admitted.
[02:23:40.730 --> 02:23:47.613]  An elderly woman collapsed and died while quailing for hours for an injection in the state of California.
[02:23:49.354 --> 02:23:49.774]  Gosh.
[02:23:51.084 --> 02:23:56.469]  And it says, long lines of the vaccines have formed at pharmacies in parts of the U.S.
[02:23:56.509 --> 02:23:59.031]  And again, the woman begged so hard for it, she dropped dead.
[02:23:59.531 --> 02:24:02.534]  Give it to me, I've got to have it, give it to me now.
[02:24:03.374 --> 02:24:06.077]  Please give me a shower, de la host me fur.
[02:24:06.817 --> 02:24:07.117]  U.S.
[02:24:07.137 --> 02:24:17.306]  Health Secretary Tommy Thompson on Thursday urged local officials to investigate reports from several states about companies raising prices to exploit the vaccine shortage.
[02:24:17.970 --> 02:24:20.372]  Every year they've got some reason for a shortage, folks.
[02:24:20.432 --> 02:24:21.812]  It's to make you run out and get it.
[02:24:22.553 --> 02:24:24.694]  Again, they've caught toy manufacturers.
[02:24:25.214 --> 02:24:30.918]  What do I mean by they're selling this like it's the Christmas toy of the year?
[02:24:31.498 --> 02:24:38.703]  Every year there's a toy or two that everybody's got to have in giant lines form and people fight over them.
[02:24:39.903 --> 02:24:47.528]  About a decade ago I saw a story where a major toy maker in several major cities with friends of theirs that were reporters on the take said,
[02:24:48.707 --> 02:24:51.148]  Staged women fighting over toys.
[02:24:52.649 --> 02:24:53.570]  They've been caught doing this.
[02:24:53.810 --> 02:24:57.151]  And then it gets in the news, and oh my gosh, I've got to have one.
[02:24:57.172 --> 02:24:57.992]  You run out to get it.
[02:24:58.592 --> 02:24:59.873]  They do this with all of it.
[02:25:00.213 --> 02:25:02.034]  Oh, you've got to get into Head Start.
[02:25:02.314 --> 02:25:05.176]  Oh, you've got to get into the public school.
[02:25:05.376 --> 02:25:10.518]  Oh, you've got to get this new vaccine that keeps your child from ever becoming addicted to drugs.
[02:25:11.119 --> 02:25:12.139]  Oh, you've got to.
[02:25:12.660 --> 02:25:14.340]  Oh, we've got to have more security.
[02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:15.281]  Everyone wants it.
[02:25:15.934 --> 02:25:18.600]  And it's that sheep-like mentality of, well, then I better have it.
[02:25:20.645 --> 02:25:23.531]  And again, they admit that it's full of live virus.
[02:25:23.631 --> 02:25:26.357]  Just a small tidbit there for you.
[02:25:28.257 --> 02:25:33.582]  Speaking of Senator Mark Dayton, why didn't 99 other Senators close up Shop 2?
[02:25:34.062 --> 02:25:37.945]  Minnesota Senator Mark Dayton shuts down his office after the CIA briefing.
[02:25:38.285 --> 02:25:49.695]  When Senator Mark Dayton shut down his Washington office last week, ostensibly out of concern for his staff's safety, many on Capitol Hill wondered if the Minnesota Democrat knew something everyone else didn't.
[02:25:50.175 --> 02:25:51.976]  The answer, it turns out, is far from it.
[02:25:52.357 --> 02:26:01.322]  Dayton last month received the same briefing as his fellow senators about a CIA worst-case scenario involving simultaneous terrorist attacks across the country.
[02:26:01.703 --> 02:26:05.245]  Yet he apparently took the hypothetical threat as an imminent one.
[02:26:05.665 --> 02:26:12.429]  Most people who heard the briefing, sniffs at intelligence official, understood the context.
[02:26:12.549 --> 02:26:13.290]  It was theoretical.
[02:26:14.577 --> 02:26:15.618]  Really, why did U.S.
[02:26:15.658 --> 02:26:22.803]  News & World Report then, before that, run the headline that White House source said Capitol will be attacked?
[02:26:24.945 --> 02:26:38.094]  Even stranger, Dayton sent his staff home several days after the CIA toned down the dramatic multiple attack scenario, which the intelligence community no longer believed to be valid, like every other attack, the financial threat attack on Capitol.
[02:26:38.499 --> 02:26:40.601]  Lower Manhattan, turned out to be four years old.
[02:26:40.921 --> 02:26:45.945]  The guys on the subway during the Republican National Convention weren't terrorists, hadn't planned to do it.
[02:26:46.125 --> 02:26:50.188]  They'd been watching them for a year, busted them on the day it began, just to have fear.
[02:26:50.689 --> 02:27:00.476]  The CIA's internal report conflicted sharply with assessments by the FBI, Department of Homeland Security, that Al-Qaeda is no longer able to mount synchronized spectacular events.
[02:27:01.117 --> 02:27:02.077]  And then it goes on and on.
[02:27:02.237 --> 02:27:05.400]  So, Dayton's press secretary says the senator has...
[02:27:06.497 --> 02:27:08.818]  No second thoughts about closing the office.
[02:27:12.018 --> 02:27:15.379]  When we get back, Bush's brother rules out bid for presidency.
[02:27:15.399 --> 02:27:20.300]  We'll also briefly talk about the mutinies in Iraq that are taking place.
[02:27:21.500 --> 02:27:29.882]  And we'll also get into some new building 7 material and a new development with the indie media servers being shut down by a foreign government.
[02:27:30.502 --> 02:27:33.343]  Our government says that we follow the orders of the EU.
[02:27:33.583 --> 02:27:34.063]  We'll be back.
[02:27:35.882 --> 02:27:36.822]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.263 --> 02:27:38.883]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.804 --> 02:27:42.565]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.506 --> 02:27:47.007]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[02:27:47.187 --> 02:27:48.328]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[02:27:48.488 --> 02:27:51.929]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[02:27:52.029 --> 02:27:52.469]  Phenol.
[02:27:52.770 --> 02:27:59.913]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[02:28:00.253 --> 02:28:00.313]  Any
[02:28:00.353 --> 02:28:04.296]  ATA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[02:28:04.396 --> 02:28:04.836]  Fragrance?
[02:28:05.216 --> 02:28:09.980]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[02:28:10.120 --> 02:28:14.783]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[02:28:15.023 --> 02:28:17.445]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[02:28:17.845 --> 02:28:21.247]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[02:28:21.387 --> 02:28:24.950]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[02:28:25.150 --> 02:28:27.471]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[02:28:27.672 --> 02:28:28.552]  So what are you waiting for?

[02:28:45.672 --> 02:28:51.914]  The illuminated Berkey base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[02:28:52.054 --> 02:28:58.216]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has eight LED lamps.
[02:28:58.476 --> 02:29:06.859]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[02:29:07.159 --> 02:29:14.221]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter, and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[02:29:14.501 --> 02:29:19.322]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[02:29:19.542 --> 02:29:24.943]  The Berkey base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[02:29:25.283 --> 02:29:28.324]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[02:29:28.684 --> 02:29:36.651]  Get the illuminated Berkey base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:29:46.593 --> 02:29:54.757]  You love your pet, and when your dog or cat starts to suffer from the debilitating effects of arthritis, you want to do everything possible to bring back their energy and spirit.
[02:29:54.977 --> 02:30:02.281]  Now, both you and your pet can benefit from a revolutionary natural approach to overcoming arthritic problems induced by aging with Pet Wonder.

[02:31:07.457 --> 02:31:10.959]  Eric Huffman's video, 9-11 Painful Deceptions.

[02:32:39.800 --> 02:32:40.420]  Again, that's 888-253-3139.
[02:32:40.440 --> 02:32:42.042]  Or just write to me.
[02:32:42.302 --> 02:32:44.944]  I'm Alex Jones at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04.
[02:33:00.197 --> 02:33:03.920]  All right, let's get back to the news, and I promise we'll get to these loaded phone lines.
[02:33:04.380 --> 02:33:08.563]  Bush's brother rules out bid for the presidency, the New York Times reports.
[02:33:09.744 --> 02:33:14.607]  Governor Jeb Bush of Florida yesterday publicly ruled out running for president in 08.
[02:33:15.468 --> 02:33:18.570]  Quashing for now, talk of a third Bush in the White House.
[02:33:18.950 --> 02:33:26.435]  The governor, who was President Bush's younger brother, said on ABC's This Week that he would return to Miami when his second term ended in 06.
[02:33:28.032 --> 02:33:33.234]  When Mr. Bush was a real estate developer here before he entered politics.
[02:33:33.354 --> 02:33:43.378]  I am not going to run for president in 08, Mr. Bush, who rarely grants interviews to the national news media, told George Stephanopoulos, the host of this week, that's not my interest.
[02:33:43.438 --> 02:33:44.538]  I'm governor of this state.
[02:33:44.858 --> 02:33:47.079]  It's the best job in the world I have.
[02:33:48.420 --> 02:33:50.340]  And he goes on to say he's a popular governor.
[02:33:50.360 --> 02:33:57.163]  Yeah, because he poses as a savior in front of every hurricane as if he personally hands out the water bottles.
[02:33:58.658 --> 02:34:03.062]  Continuing, this is out of the New York Daily News, all of us refused to go.
[02:34:03.842 --> 02:34:09.948]  The military has begun punishing some of the 19 Army Reservists who balked at what they called a suicide mission.
[02:34:10.888 --> 02:34:14.692]  By the way, the only reason this has come out is because they talked about it in emails and called family.
[02:34:14.712 --> 02:34:18.475]  A bunch of other people have refused too, and that's not being discussed.
[02:34:19.309 --> 02:34:27.335]  Again, the military has begun punishing some of the 19 Army Reservists who balked what they called a suicide mission and a death sentence in Iraq last week.
[02:34:27.755 --> 02:34:43.947]  Some members of South Carolina-based 343rd Quartermaster Company refused to transport fuel between the Iraqi cities of Talil and Taji Wednesday morning, saying they had no protection for the dangerous trip.
[02:34:45.251 --> 02:34:53.434]  And again, folks, if it was frontline combat soldiers or special forces, court-martial them if they're not following their orders.
[02:34:54.054 --> 02:35:03.418]  But you cannot expect people with a fuel depot, you know, in delivery or maintenance to, well, drive out here where there's no protection for you, and we're not going to give you any protection.
[02:35:03.438 --> 02:35:06.319]  We're going to give you old trucks that are breaking down.
[02:35:06.579 --> 02:35:09.720]  How's that sound when these trucks are getting blown up every day?
[02:35:11.070 --> 02:35:19.594]  And yesterday, an army started demoting or reassigning the suspected ringleaders of the mini-mutiny.
[02:35:20.454 --> 02:35:31.539]  Unit members told families back home that not only was the mission suicidal, it was pointless because their helicopter fuel was contaminated with diesel and had already been rejected at one air base.
[02:35:32.219 --> 02:35:35.861]  Doesn't matter how LeBurton's been paid for that fuel, they will get it delivered.
[02:35:36.787 --> 02:35:50.570]  Even if it sits there and rots, the fuel was contaminated for the helicopter, said Harold Casey of Louisville, Kentucky, whose grandson, Justin Rogers, told him yesterday that he and others were detained under guard for several days.
[02:35:53.070 --> 02:35:54.731]  It would have caused them to crash.
[02:35:55.231 --> 02:35:58.752]  They saved lives, Casey said, his grandson told him.
[02:35:59.672 --> 02:36:00.852]  Whether that's true or not,
[02:36:01.681 --> 02:36:06.084]  Secretary of the Army, who was a total neocon, said, look, it'll take 400,000 troops.
[02:36:06.604 --> 02:36:07.665]  We don't have the equipment.
[02:36:07.705 --> 02:36:08.986]  The military's falling apart.
[02:36:09.326 --> 02:36:10.427]  We shouldn't do this.
[02:36:11.567 --> 02:36:12.428]  You're fired.
[02:36:13.529 --> 02:36:15.250]  And so who should get in trouble?
[02:36:15.390 --> 02:36:23.175]  I mean, if you send 100 troops to take a hill that'll take 5,000 or 1,000, who should get in trouble?
[02:36:23.535 --> 02:36:29.419]  You know, the troops say, I'm not going to go up that hill where I'm going to be machine gunned because you say so.
[02:36:30.296 --> 02:36:33.077]  No matter how many Congressional Medal of Honors you hand out.
[02:36:33.777 --> 02:36:37.819]  And I know it's easy to sit there in your easy chair and go, Hey, you cowards.
[02:36:37.839 --> 02:36:39.359]  Well, then you go volunteer.
[02:36:39.419 --> 02:36:54.164]  You go join, and you go over there without body armor, and you get shot at, and you eat rotten food provided by Halliburton, and you breathe depleted uranium, and you drive around in the desert with no protection, while the politicians sit in their armored compounds.
[02:36:54.525 --> 02:36:55.985]  You just go ahead and be a hypocrite.
[02:36:57.886 --> 02:36:58.506]  It's ridiculous.
[02:37:00.258 --> 02:37:02.020]  So, getting pretty serious now.
[02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:03.822]  And we get these reports every day, folks.
[02:37:03.842 --> 02:37:04.863]  This is just one that's confirmed.
[02:37:05.683 --> 02:37:07.365]  Last story, and then we'll go to some calls.
[02:37:07.545 --> 02:37:08.726]  I mean fast, folks.
[02:37:09.367 --> 02:37:12.650]  Indymedia seizure signals clampdown on dissent.
[02:37:13.911 --> 02:37:15.812]  And this is Interpress reporting this.
[02:37:15.892 --> 02:37:26.322]  By the way, they admit now that it was the Italian government, members of Indymedia, mainstream press that were posting stuff there, were beat up.
[02:37:27.240 --> 02:37:30.022]  At the Genoa summit where they even killed some protesters.
[02:37:30.223 --> 02:37:34.266]  There's video of them running over bodies with tanks and backing back on with the APCs.
[02:37:35.887 --> 02:37:38.889]  They were targeted and one of their reporters was almost beaten to death.
[02:37:39.129 --> 02:37:42.332]  He is suing them for the skull fractures and the rest of it.
[02:37:43.693 --> 02:37:44.453]  And so what'd they do?
[02:37:44.493 --> 02:37:50.318]  They just went and grabbed several servers and 20 plus websites and just shot them down.
[02:37:50.338 --> 02:37:51.919]  And the FBI said, we can't refuse.
[02:37:52.219 --> 02:37:53.100]  It's a foreign government.
[02:37:53.993 --> 02:38:04.458]  Free speech advocates say the six-day shutdown of nearly two dozen websites belonging to indie media is a severe blow to democratic principles and perhaps an ominous sign of things to come.
[02:38:04.898 --> 02:38:17.364]  An international collective of journalists born out of the combative World Trade Organization meetings in Seattle five years ago, indie media has evolved into a leading outlet of progressive media activism, particularly the anti-globalization movement.
[02:38:17.684 --> 02:38:19.225]  They're against the globalists.
[02:38:19.753 --> 02:38:29.141]  While the motives behind the October 7th seizure of Indy Media London servers are still unclear, some are convinced it was orchestrated by the United States, especially since agents of the U.S.
[02:38:29.161 --> 02:38:34.946]  Federal Bureau of Investigation issued the subpoena to Rackspace, the U.S.-owned web host.
[02:38:34.986 --> 02:38:40.791]  And then it goes on that through a request of the Italian government, that's in the Associated Press, it was shut down.
[02:38:41.612 --> 02:38:42.192]  And then it says...
[02:38:43.621 --> 02:38:46.662]  This is clearly going beyond tracking down Al Qaeda cell members.
[02:38:47.343 --> 02:38:53.545]  Steinhardt said, referring to the terrorist group believed responsible for the 2001 attacks on New York and the Pentagon.
[02:38:55.006 --> 02:38:58.547]  And he says this is not part of the war on terrorism, and it's certainly not.
[02:38:59.267 --> 02:39:00.428]  All right, let's go to the calls.
[02:39:00.528 --> 02:39:01.908]  John in Tennessee, you're on the air.
[02:39:01.948 --> 02:39:02.409]  Go ahead.
[02:39:02.769 --> 02:39:03.329]  Yes, Alex.
[02:39:03.369 --> 02:39:07.051]  I'm just calling to give you an update about the police state of Tennessee here.
[02:39:08.726 --> 02:39:13.990]  I'm in Chattanooga, in the city of Ringgold, which is in Georgia, right on the state line.
[02:39:14.450 --> 02:39:22.456]  There are Russian and Eastern Bloc troops, UN troops, working with the Partnership for Peace program.
[02:39:23.917 --> 02:39:27.840]  Oh yeah, that's where we send our troops there, they send their troops here.
[02:39:27.880 --> 02:39:29.721]  Was this in your local newspaper?
[02:39:30.522 --> 02:39:34.185]  There's some reports about it on the internet and stuff, but...
[02:39:34.961 --> 02:39:35.721]  Well, do me a favor.
[02:39:36.121 --> 02:39:38.862]  I've been to 15 of these missions.
[02:39:39.302 --> 02:39:41.223]  I've put it in my three police stage films.
[02:39:42.003 --> 02:39:43.903]  But have you been to the actual training ops?
[02:39:44.464 --> 02:39:45.084]  Yes.
[02:39:45.104 --> 02:39:49.825]  They're working in Unison with FEMA at the Catoosa County Training Center in Ringgold, Georgia.
[02:39:50.265 --> 02:39:51.065]  Let me write this down.
[02:39:51.125 --> 02:39:54.226]  And see, listeners immediately shouldn't be afraid.
[02:39:54.246 --> 02:39:57.167]  If you just act normal like you're the boss, they'll leave you alone.
[02:39:58.387 --> 02:40:00.008]  And just say it with Infowars.com.
[02:40:01.509 --> 02:40:02.970]  Or the Alex Jones Radio Show.
[02:40:03.010 --> 02:40:05.712]  Just walk up with a video camera and go, What's going on, officer?
[02:40:05.732 --> 02:40:06.593]  This is really neat!
[02:40:07.173 --> 02:40:08.514]  And that's what I do.
[02:40:08.834 --> 02:40:10.816]  If you act all afraid, they'll come arrest you.
[02:40:10.856 --> 02:40:11.557]  This is how it works.
[02:40:11.577 --> 02:40:14.099]  Even though there's no law, they'll think you're showing fear.
[02:40:14.439 --> 02:40:15.420]  Shows that it's their right.
[02:40:15.780 --> 02:40:18.983]  Tell me the next... See, I wish I could just jump on a plane and fly there.
[02:40:19.003 --> 02:40:23.707]  Now, again, with FEMA, we have this confirmed in other places, but I want this on video.
[02:40:25.268 --> 02:40:26.629]  Say the name of the town very slowly.
[02:40:27.339 --> 02:40:28.440]  Ringgold, Georgia.
[02:40:28.900 --> 02:40:29.600]  Ringgold.
[02:40:30.281 --> 02:40:30.881]  Ringgold.
[02:40:31.381 --> 02:40:34.023]  Gold, Georgia.
[02:40:34.943 --> 02:40:37.304]  At the Catoosa County Training Center.
[02:40:37.324 --> 02:40:38.205]  How do you spell Catoosa?
[02:40:38.825 --> 02:40:40.666]  C-A-T-O-O-S-A.
[02:40:41.747 --> 02:40:45.949]  Catoosa County Training Center.
[02:40:46.309 --> 02:40:47.610]  Supposedly, it's an Army...
[02:40:48.754 --> 02:40:50.555]  Army Reserve National Guard Training Center.
[02:40:50.615 --> 02:40:54.516]  What they're doing there is training the Tennessee Military Police.
[02:40:56.256 --> 02:40:59.637]  There's no such thing as the Tennessee Military Police.
[02:41:00.138 --> 02:41:00.958]  Yeah, there is.
[02:41:01.098 --> 02:41:04.119]  Your state guard was turned into it six months ago.
[02:41:04.139 --> 02:41:11.021]  They have the documents from Alabama and Texas, and they just go out and literally, on the side of the street, start searching women and children.
[02:41:11.261 --> 02:41:12.061]  It's just to train you.
[02:41:12.121 --> 02:41:13.041]  It's all part of the new freedom.
[02:41:13.461 --> 02:41:14.882]  These men are foreign troops.
[02:41:16.744 --> 02:41:17.444]  I know, I know.
[02:41:17.464 --> 02:41:18.265]  This is ridiculous.
[02:41:18.766 --> 02:41:25.392]  No, no, the commander here of the State Guard, who picks who the officers are, is a British SAS.
[02:41:26.714 --> 02:41:34.422]  And KGB, and this is United Press International, folks, the former head of the KGB runs it!
[02:41:36.484 --> 02:41:39.405]  I mean, again, we can't make this type of stuff up.
[02:41:41.065 --> 02:41:42.286]  It's Red Dawn, brother.
[02:41:42.546 --> 02:41:44.306]  It's Red Dawn in slow motion, see?
[02:41:44.706 --> 02:41:52.108]  Whether it's this month or six months or a year from now or two years from now, they're getting everybody trained, everybody ready, gun confiscation drills.
[02:41:52.168 --> 02:41:54.148]  I got video of it years ago before 9-11.
[02:41:54.329 --> 02:41:56.529]  Oh, boy.
[02:41:57.049 --> 02:41:58.410]  Two more real quick things.
[02:41:58.650 --> 02:42:02.190]  They're also working in Houston with the ROTC programs in the high schools.
[02:42:02.210 --> 02:42:04.131]  I don't know if that has to do anything with the TIPS program.
[02:42:05.178 --> 02:42:07.459]  Well, it's called... They're all interlocking.
[02:42:07.519 --> 02:42:20.343]  It's called Secure Corps, a subdivision of AmeriCorps, and to graduate from high school, you'll have to serve 18 hours a week, maximum 10 hours a week minimum, in these programs with a uniform and everything.
[02:42:21.964 --> 02:42:27.706]  And so they're going to have some young high schooler who knows absolutely nothing with an M16.
[02:42:27.826 --> 02:42:32.487]  I have mainstream news articles from Texas, Tennessee, West Virginia on this.
[02:42:32.527 --> 02:42:33.108]  Thanks for the call.
[02:42:33.568 --> 02:42:34.288]  Hey, sir, you there?
[02:42:35.402 --> 02:42:36.123]  Oh, he's already gone.
[02:42:36.563 --> 02:42:36.943]  Are you there?
[02:42:37.964 --> 02:42:39.205]  I hung up on John too fast.
[02:42:40.566 --> 02:42:45.990]  I want somebody to get to the Catooso County Training Center.
[02:42:46.010 --> 02:42:46.991]  I'll call them about it.
[02:42:47.791 --> 02:42:49.613]  But I believe him.
[02:42:49.653 --> 02:42:50.994]  I've seen this many times myself.
[02:42:51.314 --> 02:42:52.575]  Hundreds of times in print.
[02:42:52.995 --> 02:42:54.717]  Hundreds of times photos and video.
[02:42:54.737 --> 02:42:56.298]  And about 15 times myself.
[02:42:57.159 --> 02:42:59.320]  But somebody get over there and get me video of this.
[02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:00.361]  Get yourself video of this.
[02:43:00.381 --> 02:43:02.963]  We'll put it in a weekly report and post it for free on the website.
[02:43:02.983 --> 02:43:03.063]  Okay?
[02:43:05.467 --> 02:43:08.473]  I say I want to go to the calls quick, and then that caller's so good.
[02:43:09.635 --> 02:43:11.820]  Mike in Indiana, or Illinois, go ahead.
[02:43:12.200 --> 02:43:16.128]  Alex, yeah, listen, I want to send you something, but I want to briefly talk about it.
[02:43:17.190 --> 02:43:24.075]  The local school that I send my children to, regrettably, a public school, had a newsletter that was sent out to the parents.
[02:43:24.155 --> 02:43:35.042]  They say that by the year 2008, the state of Illinois is looking to mandate a law that would make mandatory Spanish for middle school grades 6, 7 and 8
[02:43:36.463 --> 02:43:38.264]  Now, Alex, you and I have talked about this.
[02:43:38.284 --> 02:43:39.385]  You've talked about it on your show.
[02:43:39.425 --> 02:43:41.085]  We know that this is going to become Latin America.
[02:43:41.166 --> 02:43:43.026]  It's nothing prejudiced against a Latin person.
[02:43:43.487 --> 02:43:45.788]  But we know what's going on with the Pan-American Union at once.
[02:43:45.808 --> 02:43:46.148]  Yeah, I know.
[02:43:46.168 --> 02:43:46.989]  That's the deal.
[02:43:47.229 --> 02:43:53.612]  Giant highways from Chile to Alaska already partly complete global government.
[02:43:53.912 --> 02:43:54.112]  Right.
[02:43:54.212 --> 02:44:04.417]  And the thing is, Alex, this is disgusting because they're already talking about how, you know, English... Yeah, they can't even teach them reading, writing, and arithmetic because they teach them fuzzy math and fuzzy...
[02:44:06.459 --> 02:44:07.980]  You know, all of this on purpose.
[02:44:08.941 --> 02:44:10.482]  This is done by design.
[02:44:11.363 --> 02:44:11.663]  Absolutely.
[02:44:11.683 --> 02:44:12.984]  Can I tell you this article, Alex?
[02:44:13.184 --> 02:44:13.444]  Yes.
[02:44:13.885 --> 02:44:18.008]  And it just, you know, the one other thing, real quickly, is that it just, it's disgusting.
[02:44:18.028 --> 02:44:18.969]  It, you know...
[02:44:19.717 --> 02:44:24.141]  A friend of mine works for the county health department here in the county I live in.
[02:44:24.442 --> 02:44:31.609]  Basically, it's disgusting because they said that 90% of the people, the immigrants that come here, have TB.
[02:44:31.829 --> 02:44:32.950]  And I know that you know that, Alex.
[02:44:33.330 --> 02:44:36.553]  And it's a giant cover-up.
[02:44:36.593 --> 02:44:41.658]  They've already got sanitariums filled with them, and they're just keeping it quiet.
[02:44:41.678 --> 02:44:42.279]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:42.839 --> 02:44:44.581]  And without any testing.
[02:44:45.515 --> 02:44:50.877]  They'll arrest your 10-year-old if she brings an aspirin to school, because it's for her safety.
[02:44:51.117 --> 02:44:59.601]  But they'll stick your daughter, regardless of what color she is, next to that Russian, next to that Mexican, who has drug-immune TB that is killing people.
[02:45:00.181 --> 02:45:01.161]  That's just sick.
[02:45:02.021 --> 02:45:03.802]  I want to talk about Building 7 real quick.
[02:45:04.562 --> 02:45:07.784]  It's an Associated Press article on Infowars.com.
[02:45:09.509 --> 02:45:10.750]  They have reopened Building 7.
[02:45:11.050 --> 02:45:11.851]  They have rebuilt it.
[02:45:11.911 --> 02:45:15.493]  I was there as they were finishing it just a month ago in New York.
[02:45:16.234 --> 02:45:19.856]  And you've got to be there to see how far away it is from the rest of the complex.
[02:45:19.976 --> 02:45:24.940]  Little buildings right next to the towers that he didn't own were barely damaged or weren't damaged.
[02:45:25.140 --> 02:45:30.844]  But this building way across the street, way across Under Plaza, it magically sets fire and collapses.
[02:45:31.753 --> 02:45:40.147]  And I want to play Larry Silverstein from the program America Rebuilding where he says there's been such a loss of life we made the decision to pull it.
[02:45:40.208 --> 02:45:42.652]  Now, the piece begins with him describing...
[02:45:43.795 --> 02:45:51.418]  How they started rebuilding Building 7 first because it was the one that totally collapsed.
[02:45:51.478 --> 02:45:52.758]  So that can be confusing.
[02:45:53.159 --> 02:45:54.699]  Then it cuts to Larry Silverstein.
[02:45:54.719 --> 02:45:55.800]  The show's about rebuilding.
[02:45:56.060 --> 02:46:01.082]  It cuts to Larry Silverstein with images of the building falling, saying they pulled it that day.
[02:46:01.402 --> 02:46:06.664]  Then we play a clip where one of the engineers from the same piece says that pulling it means demolition.
[02:46:07.044 --> 02:46:09.885]  Then the next clip is Dan Rather saying it looks like dynamite.
[02:46:10.505 --> 02:46:12.166]  Here's that first clip of Larry Silverstein.
[02:46:12.626 --> 02:46:17.049]  World Trade Center 7 had always been considered the starting point for rebuilding.
[02:46:18.911 --> 02:46:26.696]  Located north of the slurry wall, 7 had been cleared faster than the rest of the site, and there had been no bodies to recover.
[02:46:30.759 --> 02:46:39.245]  Pelted by debris when the north tower collapsed, 7 burned until late afternoon, allowing occupants to evacuate to safety.
[02:46:40.556 --> 02:46:46.860]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[02:46:48.481 --> 02:46:50.442]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[02:46:51.502 --> 02:46:53.403]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull.
[02:46:54.824 --> 02:46:56.365]  And they made that decision to pull.
[02:46:56.705 --> 02:47:00.608]  And then we watched the building collapse.
[02:47:00.688 --> 02:47:03.029]  Again, what you're seeing are high shots, isn't it?
[02:47:04.552 --> 02:47:07.616]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[02:47:08.397 --> 02:47:10.599]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[02:47:12.281 --> 02:47:13.703]  It's amazing.
[02:47:14.984 --> 02:47:16.947]  Amazing, incredible, pick your word.
[02:47:18.021 --> 02:47:28.828]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by world-class dynamite to knock it down.
[02:47:31.210 --> 02:47:38.095]  By mid-December, the Department of Design and Construction had leveled World Trade Center buildings four and five.
[02:47:40.676 --> 02:47:41.537]  Hello?
[02:47:43.298 --> 02:47:44.999]  Oh, we're getting ready to pull building six.
[02:47:47.788 --> 02:47:50.169]  We have to be very careful how we demolish Building 6.
[02:47:50.229 --> 02:47:59.675]  We were worried about the Building 6 coming down and then damaging the study wall, so we wanted that particular building to fall within a certain area.
[02:48:00.155 --> 02:48:02.817]  Okay, so the first clip is Larry Silverstein.
[02:48:03.397 --> 02:48:04.558]  The second clip's Dan Rather.
[02:48:04.578 --> 02:48:08.440]  The third clip's from the same America Rebuilds documentary from PBS.
[02:48:09.139 --> 02:48:18.407]  Where then it shows them blowing up the buildings that didn't demolish, like 1, 2, and 7, on 9-11, and again, they're demolishing them, and they describe it as pulling the building.
[02:48:19.728 --> 02:48:23.271]  Then we have the seismographs, the AP reporters being told to get back, we're going to pull it.
[02:48:23.812 --> 02:48:25.873]  Building 7 wasn't hit by an airplane, people.
[02:48:25.933 --> 02:48:34.541]  It caught fire seven, eight hours later, burned for a few hours, a few small fires, and then magically collapsed, and then buildings right next to it weren't even damaged.
[02:48:35.700 --> 02:48:39.588]  But way across the road, Towers 1 and 2 fall, and it magically falls too.
[02:48:40.309 --> 02:48:41.030]  It's unbelievable.
[02:48:41.070 --> 02:48:41.712]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:45.470 --> 02:48:52.317]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[02:48:52.617 --> 02:48:53.999]  That's right folks, DVD.
[02:48:54.199 --> 02:48:56.421]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[02:48:56.561 --> 02:48:58.643]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[02:48:58.924 --> 02:49:03.848]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[02:49:04.189 --> 02:49:08.233]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[02:49:08.473 --> 02:49:09.294]  We're good to go.
[02:49:09.474 --> 02:49:09.674]  I think?
[02:49:32.190 --> 02:49:34.493]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:34.593 --> 02:49:39.280]  Or order online at Infowars.com or Infowars.net.
[02:49:39.540 --> 02:49:40.241]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[02:49:44.668 --> 02:49:52.191]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:49:52.471 --> 02:50:03.375]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark.
[02:50:03.635 --> 02:50:04.056]  We're good to go.
[02:50:20.137 --> 02:50:20.637]  That's right.
[02:50:20.797 --> 02:50:27.919]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:50:28.219 --> 02:50:36.962]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey battery adapter, complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:37.002 --> 02:50:37.462]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.

[02:51:47.373 --> 02:51:51.014]  You know, you can go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanta.com.
[02:51:52.293 --> 02:52:00.137]  And type it at the search engine, Pull Building 7, and a 30-minute report I did on it, and then all those clips and all the documents are there, and it's for free.
[02:52:00.897 --> 02:52:13.583]  But when we first put that up, several million people went and watched it, and we had to take it down for a while, and that's why we went to prisonplanet.tv and started trying to raise a little bit of money so we can then have stuff like that for free on the site.
[02:52:14.123 --> 02:52:14.604]  It's a catch-22.
[02:52:16.737 --> 02:52:23.179]  And just here's one more quick little clip of Silverstein saying we made the decision to pull Building 7 on that day.
[02:52:23.219 --> 02:52:23.660]  Here it is.
[02:52:23.980 --> 02:52:30.262]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[02:52:31.582 --> 02:52:33.843]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[02:52:33.863 --> 02:52:36.804]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull.
[02:52:38.225 --> 02:52:39.725]  And they made that decision to pull.
[02:52:40.105 --> 02:52:42.406]  And then we watched the building collapse.
[02:52:42.506 --> 02:52:45.007]  All right, and they show Building 7 collapse.
[02:52:46.905 --> 02:52:48.726]  Let's go ahead and take three quick calls.
[02:52:48.826 --> 02:52:50.246]  Mike, Laura, and Sherry.
[02:52:50.586 --> 02:52:52.086]  Mike and Georgia, go ahead.
[02:52:52.506 --> 02:52:55.807]  Hey, good to talk to you again, Alex.
[02:52:56.627 --> 02:52:56.927]  Welcome.
[02:52:57.027 --> 02:53:03.949]  On Michael Moore's video of Fahrenheit 9-11, you can see George Bush addressing a group of elitists.
[02:53:04.069 --> 02:53:06.970]  He says they're the haves and the have-mores or something like that.
[02:53:07.450 --> 02:53:10.230]  And he refers to them as his faith.
[02:53:10.670 --> 02:53:13.691]  He's talking to an elitist group at a dinner or a luncheon.
[02:53:14.116 --> 02:53:17.258]  And first come as his face, which translated, is Al Qaeda.
[02:53:17.398 --> 02:53:20.800]  I thought that was very interesting that he would make that reference.
[02:53:22.041 --> 02:53:37.431]  Also, the day of 9-11, September 11, 2001, CNN had a blurb on the bottom later that evening that said, when I was recording Fox and I was remiss in recording CNN, I should have been, headline news, the crawl said,
[02:53:38.224 --> 02:53:47.889]  That WCC7 collapse, not related to collapse of Towers 1 and 2, but due to a fire underneath the building in a power generation plant.
[02:53:48.069 --> 02:53:50.450]  I just want to tell you that was their cover story that day.
[02:53:50.790 --> 02:53:58.293]  And now they say, well that's actually in the FEMA report, that now they say, oh that wasn't the case, we just don't know why it happened.
[02:53:58.333 --> 02:53:59.014]  Thanks for the call.
[02:53:59.794 --> 02:54:00.875]  I appreciate it.
[02:54:01.055 --> 02:54:03.756]  Laura in Missouri, go ahead.
[02:54:04.736 --> 02:54:05.357]  Hello Alex.
[02:54:05.597 --> 02:54:05.937]  Hello.
[02:54:06.818 --> 02:54:18.864]  I got the 9-11, the Great Illusion pamphlets, the five of them, and I've been waiting to get the Berkey Light water system, and it's been like five weeks, almost five weeks.
[02:54:18.884 --> 02:54:24.387]  Well, ma'am, I don't ship the Berkey water systems, but when I've ordered them, I get them in about three days.
[02:54:24.407 --> 02:54:25.568]  They ship at UPS.
[02:54:25.668 --> 02:54:26.428]  Have you called 888-803-4438?
[02:54:26.488 --> 02:54:26.888]  Yes, sir.
[02:54:31.078 --> 02:54:32.199]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[02:54:32.239 --> 02:54:35.001]  Give me your number right now, and I'll find out what's going on.
[02:54:35.021 --> 02:54:37.302]  We may have a wrong address or something, but again, I don't do that.
[02:54:37.362 --> 02:54:38.043]  Everybody's been happy.
[02:54:38.063 --> 02:54:39.363]  You're the first person who's ever heard of a problem.
[02:54:39.604 --> 02:54:40.544]  So let me put you on hold.
[02:54:40.604 --> 02:54:44.387]  I'll get your number, and I'll give that to Debbie, and I'm sure she'll handle it.
[02:54:44.647 --> 02:54:45.748]  What else is on your mind, ma'am?
[02:54:46.308 --> 02:54:58.736]  Well, I was watching the news yesterday, and they had a commercial on with a horse on there, and they said vaccinations had been contaminated, and then all of a sudden they had a
[02:54:59.471 --> 02:55:05.356]  Well, that's pretty ridiculous if Kerry's trying to blame Bush for contaminated vaccines out of England.
[02:55:21.411 --> 02:55:23.011]  I mean, that's just so classic.
[02:55:23.231 --> 02:55:24.452]  I tell you what, I'm going to put you on hold.
[02:55:24.492 --> 02:55:28.633]  Give me your number, and I'll get with you on that or get it to New Millennium.
[02:55:29.273 --> 02:55:31.193]  Sherry in Kansas.
[02:55:31.233 --> 02:55:31.853]  Last caller.
[02:55:31.873 --> 02:55:32.693]  Go ahead, Sherry.
[02:55:33.634 --> 02:55:34.174]  Hey, Alex.
[02:55:34.274 --> 02:55:35.874]  Did you watch our Dateline last night?
[02:55:36.514 --> 02:55:37.054]  I didn't know.
[02:55:38.835 --> 02:55:46.676]  They were doing a show on fake beauty products and how they work and don't and the line they feed you to buy it.
[02:55:46.776 --> 02:55:48.437]  But one company, C-Lab, 21...
[02:55:51.494 --> 02:56:00.257]  Ask them to take DNA from you, swab it out of your mouth, and send it in to get a DNA-type treatment for you.
[02:56:00.277 --> 02:56:05.359]  And I just thought I'd let you know that's a way that they're collecting DNA out there.
[02:56:05.619 --> 02:56:06.620]  They're doing it all over.
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:16.063]  Now they're going to try to pass laws where you get pulled over at a checkpoint and they go ahead and just take your DNA out of your cheek because it's a painless process and people don't seem to mind it.
[02:56:16.884 --> 02:56:18.084]  It's totally Orwellian.
[02:56:18.384 --> 02:56:18.924]  Anything else?
[02:56:19.945 --> 02:56:20.545]  Nope, that's all.
[02:56:21.201 --> 02:56:21.642]  Back tomorrow.
[02:56:21.682 --> 02:56:22.143]  God bless you all.
