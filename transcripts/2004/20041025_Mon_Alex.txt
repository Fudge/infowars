[00:00:05.474 --> 00:00:06.114]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.775 --> 00:00:07.816]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.536 --> 00:00:09.657]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.298 --> 00:00:11.119]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.401]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.461 --> 00:00:17.384]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:21.708]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:31.418 --> 00:00:32.919]  Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:36.281]  It is Monday, the 25th day of October, 2004.
[00:00:39.643 --> 00:00:49.749]  We're just seven days away from the 2004 presidential election and all those other candidates that are up for election or re-election as well.
[00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.832]  Massive broadcast lined up for you today in about 30 minutes.
[00:00:54.892 --> 00:00:55.593]  Jim Myers...
[00:00:56.861 --> 00:01:00.203]  Author of 9-11 and Inside Job will be joining us.
[00:01:00.223 --> 00:01:06.227]  And then he hasn't been with us in about three weeks, Paul Joseph Watson, in the third hour as well.
[00:01:06.327 --> 00:01:14.832]  So, big broadcast lined up for you, plus a huge stack of very important news and information, and of course, your phone calls.
[00:01:16.273 --> 00:01:21.876]  Interesting article out of the Kansas City newspaper.
[00:01:23.012 --> 00:01:27.833]  And it says that advocates argue high-tech counterterrorism policies violate rights.
[00:01:29.294 --> 00:01:32.235]  And it says we're sorry you can't ride the metro.
[00:01:32.335 --> 00:01:41.218]  That might be the government's response in the near future if your name is on a security watch list under your new driver's license national ID card.
[00:01:42.238 --> 00:01:43.918]  Now, again, I've been saying this for years.
[00:01:44.178 --> 00:01:46.179]  We've had it from Ridge's mouth for two years.
[00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.661]  Now it's in two different bills, one of which is passed in the conference, about to go to the president.
[00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:52.661]  We're fighting to stop it.
[00:01:54.532 --> 00:02:01.886]  And to have a job, to do anything, you'll have to have a green light on your ID card.
[00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.332]  That's your new freedom.
[00:02:06.388 --> 00:02:09.169]  So we'll be covering that, plus an article I wrote with Paul Watson.
[00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.872]  Red Sox fan death underlines distorted mentality of both police and the public.
[00:02:14.892 --> 00:02:16.132]  There's been some new developments there.
[00:02:16.172 --> 00:02:16.733]  We'll cover that.
[00:02:17.213 --> 00:02:20.194]  Plus an article about it out of the Desert News out of Utah.
[00:02:20.274 --> 00:02:22.615]  Death sparks a look at non-lethal weapons.
[00:02:22.675 --> 00:02:25.937]  Crowd control devices also used in Utah.
[00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:27.217]  Yeah, all over the country.
[00:02:28.158 --> 00:02:31.759]  And then, of course, we'll get into the latest election developments.
[00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:35.761]  The Queen of Disarming the Slaves draws a handful of minions.
[00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:48.376]  Rosie O'Donnell, over the weekend, had a highly publicized meeting of pro-Carry supporters, and about two dozen people showed up and share a few days before.
[00:02:48.396 --> 00:02:51.140]  Had a couple hundred, so that's how pathetic...
[00:02:51.992 --> 00:02:52.673]  These people are.
[00:02:52.733 --> 00:02:55.175]  I mean, they're so pathetic, they make me want to vote for Bush.
[00:02:55.735 --> 00:02:59.798]  And I remember how much I can't stand them, but of course I'm not going to vote for Bush because he's just as evil.
[00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.620]  But this is part of the whole fake left-right paradigm.
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.465]  Look at these disgusting, globalist, elitist minions like Rosie O'Donnell and Cher.
[00:03:09.266 --> 00:03:10.927]  And it makes George Bush look good.
[00:03:12.012 --> 00:03:18.896]  So we'll remember these failures, these gun-grabbing creatures today and go over this.
[00:03:19.256 --> 00:03:22.098]  Plus female soldiers eyed for combat by Lord Bush.
[00:03:22.138 --> 00:03:23.619]  That's the Washington Times.
[00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.361]  By the way, Bush is now signed on to the International Criminal Court.
[00:03:27.401 --> 00:03:28.501]  Nobody's talking about that.
[00:03:29.662 --> 00:03:32.023]  He's increased the global abortion funding.
[00:03:32.063 --> 00:03:36.105]  But again, he'll say he's against something, but then fund it, and people go, oh, he's so conservative.
[00:03:36.506 --> 00:03:40.568]  But now he wants female soldiers in front-line combat.
[00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:48.376]  Also out of medical news today, old news for our listeners, but new news for the general public, tainted polio jabs.
[00:03:48.476 --> 00:03:52.879]  Did Australian government knowingly release them filled with cancer viruses?
[00:03:55.881 --> 00:03:56.621]  And U.S.
[00:03:56.641 --> 00:03:59.603]  took detainees outside Iraq for interrogation.
[00:03:59.643 --> 00:04:00.544]  We'll get into that.
[00:04:00.584 --> 00:04:02.645]  That's old news, but now finally mainstream news.
[00:04:03.185 --> 00:04:04.986]  And we know that Bush and Kerry are cousins.
[00:04:05.027 --> 00:04:08.549]  We now know that Bush and Cheney are cousins.
[00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:10.090]  Hence, and...
[00:04:11.477 --> 00:04:13.678]  Mr. Carey, cousins with Chaney as well.
[00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.621]  Now guess who we learn one of their main family lines stems from?
[00:04:20.002 --> 00:04:24.945]  Oh yes, a direct relation to someone who's not very friendly.
[00:04:26.046 --> 00:04:30.969]  And we'll be telling you about that later in this first hour as well.
[00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.072]  Oh man, this gets too rich.
[00:04:36.172 --> 00:04:39.774]  You know, the first guy I ever heard report on this and say this
[00:04:41.627 --> 00:04:42.828]  He's in prison right now.
[00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:49.115]  Not too happy with this book, Bloodlines the Illuminati, but here it is from MSNBC.
[00:04:50.797 --> 00:04:51.077]  Hmm.
[00:04:51.998 --> 00:04:54.661]  How is old Count Dracula doing these days?
[00:04:55.722 --> 00:04:57.804]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:57.844 --> 00:04:58.605]  This is too rich.
[00:05:03.388 --> 00:05:08.871]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.292 --> 00:05:13.534]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:05:13.754 --> 00:05:20.798]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.179 --> 00:05:27.282]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.302 --> 00:05:28.643]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:28.843 --> 00:05:29.323]  We're good to go.
[00:05:29.343 --> 00:05:29.844]  We're good to go.
[00:05:45.752 --> 00:05:48.897]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll free.
[00:05:48.917 --> 00:05:48.978]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:48.998 --> 00:05:49.038]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.238 --> 00:05:50.200]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.420]  Call today.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.121]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[00:06:04.161 --> 00:06:08.362]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[00:06:08.603 --> 00:06:11.383]  But if you placed them on the magnet, all would stick.
[00:06:11.563 --> 00:06:13.984]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[00:06:14.164 --> 00:06:22.807]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[00:06:23.007 --> 00:06:24.348]  The Berkey light is different.
[00:06:24.548 --> 00:06:28.729]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path.
[00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:29.469]  We're good to go.
[00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:01.850]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.092]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:07:05.232 --> 00:07:09.113]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:07:09.153 --> 00:07:13.415]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[00:07:13.755 --> 00:07:17.537]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:07:17.657 --> 00:07:19.478]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:07:20.078 --> 00:07:22.980]  Why have police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately?
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.744]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:07:27.884 --> 00:07:30.927]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[00:07:31.107 --> 00:07:33.969]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:07:34.469 --> 00:07:40.574]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:07:40.974 --> 00:07:41.214]  Big Brother.
[00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:07.890]  Mainstream media.
[00:08:08.611 --> 00:08:09.691]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.351 --> 00:08:11.211]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:12.812]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:12.832 --> 00:08:17.153]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.693 --> 00:08:21.814]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:26.135]  Again, it is Monday, the 25th.
[00:08:35.135 --> 00:08:44.737]  Of October 2004, Jim Mars joining us in about 25 minutes, Paul Watson in the third hour, your calls, tons of news throughout the broadcast today.
[00:08:45.697 --> 00:08:48.217]  You know, I'm not going to sit here and make listeners wait for this.
[00:08:48.257 --> 00:08:51.498]  I'm going to go ahead and go into it now, and we can talk about this later if you want.
[00:08:51.518 --> 00:08:56.979]  You know, it sounds ridiculous, it sounds unbelievable, but we already knew about this.
[00:08:56.999 --> 00:09:02.880]  I have interviewed people years ago who were, of course, covering this.
[00:09:03.996 --> 00:09:13.365]  You have to understand that the global elite in the Western world, and even globally to an extent, worldwide, are interrelated.
[00:09:13.545 --> 00:09:21.773]  And I don't mean like all humanity goes back to the first Homo sapiens in Africa.
[00:09:21.953 --> 00:09:26.077]  I mean the rich people, powerful elites, tribal chieftains,
[00:09:27.086 --> 00:09:32.509]  Had alliances and would intermarry for truces, and this has just happened throughout history.
[00:09:32.529 --> 00:09:36.450]  And the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, in a command and control system.
[00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:40.872]  In a Renaissance free market system, the elite loses that control.
[00:09:41.212 --> 00:09:42.213]  That's why they're against it.
[00:09:44.314 --> 00:09:48.076]  And the New World Order crowd, they're all related.
[00:09:48.256 --> 00:09:55.659]  I mean, when you talk about top-level globalists that go to places like the Bilderberg Group meeting, they're all related, every time we look at it.
[00:09:56.232 --> 00:10:00.994]  From the big genealogy organizations that are highly respected that keep these records.
[00:10:01.414 --> 00:10:02.474]  They're obsessed with it.
[00:10:03.474 --> 00:10:06.996]  They believe that they are the super humans, that they're better than us.
[00:10:07.316 --> 00:10:08.636]  That's why they're the elite.
[00:10:08.696 --> 00:10:09.916]  That's why they're in power.
[00:10:10.237 --> 00:10:17.359]  Because they're ruthless and they're willing to make the hard decisions and they have the big vision and the whole world is under their control.
[00:10:20.942 --> 00:10:22.943]  Now, we know that Bush and Kerry are cousins.
[00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:24.943]  I mean, I was talking about that years ago.
[00:10:25.003 --> 00:10:25.903]  People couldn't believe it.
[00:10:25.963 --> 00:10:27.304]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:10:27.404 --> 00:10:29.244]  And then now we've learned something new.
[00:10:29.704 --> 00:10:34.066]  We knew that Dick Cheney had an uncle and a grandfather who were skull and bones.
[00:10:34.506 --> 00:10:37.006]  We knew that Cheney flunked out of Yale twice.
[00:10:37.787 --> 00:10:39.067]  Bush has made jokes about that.
[00:10:39.507 --> 00:10:43.048]  We know that he's related to Bush and then, hence, very closely related to Kerry.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.184]  We posted the genealogical tree of Bush and Carey, how they're related on all four sides of their family.
[00:10:50.604 --> 00:10:55.908]  Bush's mommy, Bush's daddy, Carey's mother and father, all related to each other.
[00:10:55.928 --> 00:10:59.350]  It's not like they're just related on one side of one side of the family.
[00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:05.093]  They're related at every level, from what, 5th cousins up to 16th cousins.
[00:11:07.835 --> 00:11:09.376]  It's the bloodlines of the Illuminati.
[00:11:09.436 --> 00:11:09.536]  Okay.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.621]  And they've got the family trees.
[00:11:12.241 --> 00:11:24.645]  They say that Kerry was going to win because Berks Perridge, the most respected over in England, has tracked that in modern times presidents who have more royal blood always win.
[00:11:25.025 --> 00:11:30.147]  And then that's been picked up by the London Guardian, the Associated Press, MSNBC, you name it.
[00:11:31.963 --> 00:11:40.386]  Well, I've been thinking that Bush is going to win for the last few years, and then it almost convinced me when the Bilderberg Group endorsed Kerry that he would win, but I still think it's going to be Bush.
[00:11:40.706 --> 00:11:44.167]  My guts tell me it's going to be Bush, and now it looks like it's trending that way.
[00:11:45.588 --> 00:11:48.369]  Bush has been arrogant from the start, that, oh, I'm not going to lose, there's no way.
[00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:50.390]  Uh-huh, you'll just see what happens.
[00:11:52.531 --> 00:11:53.311]  It's like he told a...
[00:11:54.392 --> 00:12:00.322]  reporter on board his campaign jet a week into the whole debate back in 2000 of who was going to win.
[00:12:00.342 --> 00:12:01.624]  He goes, you see, I'm going to win.
[00:12:01.724 --> 00:12:02.545]  Just watch.
[00:12:02.746 --> 00:12:03.307]  See what happens.
[00:12:05.074 --> 00:12:18.177]  But you look at these maps of genealogy, Kerry is related to the Sun King of France, the Hungarian kings, the Austrian-Hungarian kings, the Russian kings, the Dutch kings, the German kings, the British kings, and Queens.
[00:12:18.237 --> 00:12:19.177]  I mean, it's all the same thing.
[00:12:19.598 --> 00:12:26.219]  And Bush is related to most of the groups that Kerry is related to, but they say Kerry is related to more of the groups, so he's going to be the winner.
[00:12:27.079 --> 00:12:29.600]  But then I look at this MSNBC article,
[00:12:31.063 --> 00:12:47.838]  Tree, and it shows that Bush is more closely related to the dominant royal family, which all other big royal families, there's an admitted global organization of royalty, and they all swear fealty to the coat of arms of the Saxe-Coburg-Dotha, known publicly as the House of Windsor, a made-up name.
[00:12:49.599 --> 00:12:56.045]  And so, guess who Bush and Kerry are both related to very closely, in direct bloodlines?
[00:12:58.314 --> 00:13:05.475]  Well, it's on MSN right now, and you can go to Infowars.com, being updated right now, and read this, link through to it.
[00:13:07.056 --> 00:13:10.936]  They are both related to Vlad the Impaler.
[00:13:12.136 --> 00:13:23.078]  That's right, and they say, though it's unbelievable and very strange, the family roots section, they are both related to Vlad the Impaler.
[00:13:23.178 --> 00:13:26.239]  Presidential nominees George W. Bush and John Kerry are related.
[00:13:27.239 --> 00:13:30.060]  To these notorious monarchs.
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:36.422]  And they show Henry VIII, Ivan the Terrible, Vlad III, the Impaler.
[00:13:38.242 --> 00:13:40.483]  And his name was actually Vlad Dracula.
[00:13:40.503 --> 00:13:42.704]  That's where you get the legend of that.
[00:13:42.784 --> 00:13:46.045]  Because he liked to have people stuck up on poles.
[00:13:47.505 --> 00:13:49.606]  Up through their bodies to stay alive for days.
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.122]  His wife liked to take baths in blood.
[00:13:53.142 --> 00:13:54.123]  I mean, that's all admitted.
[00:13:54.143 --> 00:13:57.706]  It was all part of the terrorism to scare the people into submission.
[00:13:59.267 --> 00:14:01.490]  But, you know, here they say select which one.
[00:14:01.530 --> 00:14:05.754]  And it says Henry VIII, Ivan the Terrible, Dracula, Vlad III.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.600]  Well, wait a minute.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:20.384]  They just say he's related to Vlad here, but when you do go look at the family tree, they admit that Perry's also related to Ivan the Terrible, which Bush is not, but they're also both directly related to Henry VIII.
[00:14:21.565 --> 00:14:23.925]  I mean, there's nobody these guys aren't related to.
[00:14:25.146 --> 00:14:32.568]  And so, direct bloodline back to Vlad III, Dracula the Impaler.
[00:14:36.858 --> 00:14:38.820]  I guess bloodlust runs in the family.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:52.810]  And then both these guys are members of a Germanic death cult founded in 1832 out of Germany where there's the skull motifs and the laying in the coffins and all of this.
[00:14:54.552 --> 00:14:57.674]  And then they go to Bohemian Grove and they engage in these satanic ceremonies.
[00:14:57.714 --> 00:14:58.214]  I've been there.
[00:15:00.336 --> 00:15:00.856]  I snuck in.
[00:15:00.896 --> 00:15:01.737]  I got video of it.
[00:15:03.166 --> 00:15:09.068]  And then ABC News gets the New York Observer video where they're screaming, Oh, Satan, die!
[00:15:09.608 --> 00:15:10.589]  Die, neophyte!
[00:15:10.609 --> 00:15:13.210]  And splitting throats and people screaming simulated murders.
[00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.391]  And Peter Jennings says, Oh, they're just having some fun.
[00:15:16.451 --> 00:15:18.172]  You're Christian conservative leaders.
[00:15:18.572 --> 00:15:26.035]  These two little cousins sworn in in the same coffin, the same tomb, begging Lucifer to enter their bodies.
[00:15:26.295 --> 00:15:27.435]  Oh, Lucifer, they say.
[00:15:30.476 --> 00:15:32.157]  And is it any surprise...
[00:15:33.197 --> 00:15:43.760]  That they are in this death cult, the order of death, and that they're related directly back to Vlad the Impaler.
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:51.862]  I just thought that was just too interesting, and so we have now covered that, and you're welcome to talk about it if you'd like.
[00:15:52.665 --> 00:15:55.487]  But, you know, it's not their only ancestor that had a bloodlust.
[00:15:55.667 --> 00:16:03.593]  Oh, I mean, they had much more recent ancestors, and why they have dwarfed anything that Vlad the Impaler ever did, Bush has, especially in the real world.
[00:16:03.653 --> 00:16:15.682]  I mean, using depleted uranium that our own troops breathe and the Iraqis breathe, and bombing all these different nations, and torturing people, and butchering the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:16:16.722 --> 00:16:19.985]  We're just going to start calling Bush and Kerry the Vlad Brothers.
[00:16:22.418 --> 00:16:27.081]  It should be George V. Bush and John V. Carey.
[00:16:28.862 --> 00:16:30.282]  I shouldn't laugh about it, folks.
[00:16:30.302 --> 00:16:31.903]  These people run our lives.
[00:16:32.283 --> 00:16:37.886]  And they're just high-level minions, but they're in power because they are part of that bloodline.
[00:16:38.966 --> 00:16:47.771]  So, again, they all just keep marrying into each other's ruthless circles, getting more and more vicious.
[00:16:48.894 --> 00:16:50.536]  And they're a bunch of social Darwinists.
[00:16:50.556 --> 00:16:59.406]  They believe that we deserve all this, that there are rightful rulers, and that we're a bunch of cattle, a bunch of pigs, a bunch of bugs, a bunch of useless feeders and eaters.
[00:17:01.849 --> 00:17:09.317]  And, of course, they're very concerned about all the little children of the earth and have a lot of wonderful vaccines for you and your families.
[00:17:09.878 --> 00:17:11.159]  It takes such good care of you.
[00:17:11.179 --> 00:17:23.532]  Just let them take all your rights and put an electronic straitjacket on the society and put all the police in black ski masks and uniforms and let them train with non-lethal weapons on us so they can use the real ones on us very soon.
[00:17:25.714 --> 00:17:28.097]  This is out of the Kansas City newspaper.
[00:17:28.657 --> 00:17:33.062]  Advocates argue high-tech counterterrorism policies violate rights.
[00:17:33.903 --> 00:17:36.924]  And it says, we are sorry you can't ride the Metro.
[00:17:36.964 --> 00:17:41.585]  That might be the government response in the near future if your name is on a security watch list.
[00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:45.846]  A driver's license won't just be a license to drive.
[00:17:45.866 --> 00:17:55.829]  It will be the bearer of your entire life history, civil rights, and privacy organizations predicted at the discussion Wednesday that these things might happen if the U.S.
[00:17:55.849 --> 00:17:59.950]  government broadens its efforts to combat terrorism by collecting more data about individuals.
[00:18:00.603 --> 00:18:14.050]  In the wake of September 11th, terrorist attacks, increased airline security and procedures have changed travel for everyone and become a nightmare for some passengers whose names resemble those of suspected terrorists, or I would add, criminals.
[00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:16.671]  200,000 people is down on the list and growing.
[00:18:17.092 --> 00:18:23.395]  Civil rights and privacy advocates argue that a government database with such information about individuals is a fundamental threat to civil rights.
[00:18:24.164 --> 00:18:30.228]  For example, the Share Network is a plan in which the government would share information with all private companies that keep data on customers.
[00:18:30.368 --> 00:18:34.391]  It's like the pizza place reporting on you where you're at when you call in to get a pizza.
[00:18:34.451 --> 00:18:36.293]  It's run through a database to see if you're wanted.
[00:18:36.313 --> 00:18:38.074]  Instead of a pizza, you get a SWAT team.
[00:18:39.568 --> 00:18:43.231]  It says the government would know everything anyone buys.
[00:18:43.271 --> 00:18:45.332]  It admits this will be controlled by the credit card companies.
[00:18:45.852 --> 00:19:00.442]  If anyone wanted to use a credit card to buy a Metro fare card for the Capital Rail Transit System, the fare card machine would refuse the sale for anyone on a watch list at David L. Sobel, the General Counsel for the Electronic Information Center.
[00:19:00.902 --> 00:19:03.184]  Sobel says the new government policy is problematic.
[00:19:03.484 --> 00:19:06.086]  And again, they've already put this policy into effect.
[00:19:06.753 --> 00:19:17.760]  And Ridge said two years ago on C-SPAN to have a driver's license, to drive a taxi, to drive a bus, to get on a bus, to get on a train, to have a job in hundreds of different job descriptions.
[00:19:18.921 --> 00:19:19.762]  It goes on and on.
[00:19:20.282 --> 00:19:22.543]  Sobel said the new government policy is problematic.
[00:19:22.644 --> 00:19:23.224]  Problematic?
[00:19:23.604 --> 00:19:23.924]  The U.S.
[00:19:23.944 --> 00:19:29.248]  government has invested billions of dollars to develop new technologies with a computer-assisted passenger pre-screening system.
[00:19:29.784 --> 00:19:33.428]  Known as CAPS-2 to identify and track terrorists and their activities for air travel.
[00:19:34.068 --> 00:19:36.530]  Any of you got something on your credit report that isn't you?
[00:19:37.131 --> 00:19:37.692]  Who doesn't?
[00:19:38.452 --> 00:19:41.735]  Well, this is one of the baselines used for this new grid.
[00:19:43.417 --> 00:19:50.283]  And it's amazing, folks, and that bill, the new national ID card bill, was passed the House and Senate.
[00:19:50.724 --> 00:19:52.946]  It's in conference committee, about to go to the President.
[00:19:53.735 --> 00:19:55.516]  Of course, the whole plan's already implemented.
[00:19:55.876 --> 00:19:58.217]  They passed the law after this stuff's already in place.
[00:19:58.537 --> 00:20:00.177]  PrisonPlanet.tv, stay with us.
[00:20:01.938 --> 00:20:04.959]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.

[00:20:14.422 --> 00:20:19.084]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[00:20:19.564 --> 00:20:26.290]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:38.500]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:43.405]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[00:21:01.098 --> 00:21:04.999]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[00:21:05.219 --> 00:21:17.503]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase outpacing its previous 10 years.
[00:21:17.923 --> 00:21:18.323]  The U.S.
[00:21:18.363 --> 00:21:23.965]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[00:21:24.345 --> 00:21:26.566]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[00:21:28.426 --> 00:21:28.906]  We're good to go.
[00:21:49.276 --> 00:21:53.298]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[00:21:53.398 --> 00:21:55.960]  Call 1-800-686-2237.

[00:22:04.645 --> 00:22:09.868]  Have you ever been told that communism has collapsed and no longer a threat to our national sovereignty?
[00:22:10.708 --> 00:22:17.552]  If so, why are communists overthrowing African and South and Central American governments to install a communist regime?
[00:22:18.644 --> 00:22:27.248]  If so, why has Cuba and China agreed with other communist countries to surround the United States in preparation for an attack to end capitalism?
[00:22:28.328 --> 00:22:36.352]  We'd like to help you understand why these things are happening by offering you an absolutely free one-year subscription to Newswatch Magazine.

[00:22:39.653 --> 00:22:39.993]  That's 1-800-
[00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:50.192]  516-8736.

[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:02.405]  I try glucosamine for my arthritis.
[00:23:02.711 --> 00:23:03.612]  But it didn't help much.
[00:23:03.852 --> 00:23:06.275]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[00:23:06.535 --> 00:23:11.701]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[00:23:11.861 --> 00:23:12.582]  Well, no more.
[00:23:12.742 --> 00:23:15.685]  I'm pleased to tell you about a totally new product called Injuve.
[00:23:16.005 --> 00:23:19.209]  Rather than stopping the pain, Injuve attacks the causes of joint pain.
[00:23:19.469 --> 00:23:24.952]  Injuve replenishes what your body was born with by replacing a vital fluid your body loses as you grow older.
[00:23:25.172 --> 00:23:27.733]  It's called hyaluronic acid, or HA.
[00:23:28.013 --> 00:23:35.777]  It's important to note that Injuve does not cure arthritis, but it helps reverse the aging process of our joints and reduces the pain and stiffness caused by lack of mobility.
[00:23:35.997 --> 00:23:39.198]  Injuve is one of the best lubricants and shock absorbers found in nature.
[00:23:39.418 --> 00:23:43.660]  In short, if you have joint pain or arthritis, you owe it to yourself to try Injuve.
[00:23:43.941 --> 00:23:46.922]  Injuve is all natural and comes in easy-to-swallow soft gels.
[00:23:47.182 --> 00:23:51.746]  All right, now I want to spend a few minutes talking about Victoria Snellgrove, who was murdered last week.
[00:24:14.469 --> 00:24:34.331]  Since she was killed by the Boston police firing their projectile weapons at very close range, which the weapons, because I've seen them up close on local Austin police, say lethal at close distances, and they give them training, they still killed her, but now that's not what the story is about, how the photos were put in the newspapers.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:45.683]  We're a society that begs to be distracted off of the real issues, and some people are actually saying, so what, she died, and siding with the police.
[00:24:45.923 --> 00:24:52.225]  I was even on a big national show out of Chicago this morning, and the host was talking about how he's been hearing people talk like this.
[00:24:52.806 --> 00:24:54.086]  I mean, this is sick, folks.
[00:24:54.958 --> 00:24:59.406]  Red Sox fan death underlines distorted mentality of both police and the public.
[00:25:00.087 --> 00:25:08.142]  Alex Jones and Paul Watson, the tragic and unnecessary death of Victoria Snellgrove did not just provide us with another example of horrific police brutality.
[00:25:09.036 --> 00:25:14.098]  It emphasized a brutal shift in attitudes towards violence and reality in general.
[00:25:14.178 --> 00:25:26.942]  Snellgrove was struck in the left eye by a projectile containing pepper spray that was filled by police, that was fired by police amid riots in the aftermath of the Red Sox win over the Yankees last Thursday night.
[00:25:27.922 --> 00:25:30.863]  And again, it hit her in the eye and her eye was pushed back into her brain.
[00:25:30.883 --> 00:25:33.924]  She bled to death inside the internal bleeding.
[00:25:34.264 --> 00:25:35.665]  It's just inside the skull cavity.
[00:25:36.269 --> 00:25:51.463]  The only source telling us that there were out-of-control riots were the police themselves, a Reuters AP photo, wire search indicates the opposite, a few idiots throwing Moloch cocktails in one small area, and a fire which is no larger and no more dangerous than a box of matches.
[00:25:52.864 --> 00:26:00.271]  And again, first they admitted it was just a few hundred revelers here and there, then after they killed her they said it was 80,000, it was out of control, we couldn't maintain order.
[00:26:00.791 --> 00:26:01.512]  We had to do it.
[00:26:02.788 --> 00:26:06.550]  And it says this was the fire that police were struggling to keep people away from.
[00:26:06.570 --> 00:26:07.390]  We have a photo of it.
[00:26:07.730 --> 00:26:10.111]  Hardly of Reichstag proportions.
[00:26:10.231 --> 00:26:16.654]  The only other photo of the AP Reuters wire of the Red Sox riots is used as a search parameter.
[00:26:16.954 --> 00:26:18.955]  Shows one individual throwing a smoke bomb.
[00:26:19.855 --> 00:26:27.258]  It's pretty clear that all the tall tales of riots were a ruse to try and justify wildly out of control police brutality.
[00:26:28.411 --> 00:26:36.168]  Another caveat to Snellgrove's death was the Boston Herald had to publicly apologize for carrying a photo of her body as she lay dying on the sidewalk.
[00:26:36.832 --> 00:26:42.353]  The paper stated, The Herald today published two graphic photos that angered and upset many in our community.
[00:26:42.373 --> 00:26:43.394]  Yeah, not the murder of her.
[00:26:43.854 --> 00:26:45.354]  For that, I apologize.
[00:26:45.394 --> 00:26:46.334]  Herald Media Inc.
[00:26:46.434 --> 00:27:02.878]  Editorial Director Kenneth A. Chandler said in a statement to be published in the paper's Saturday editions, Our aim was to demonstrate this terrible tragedy as comprehensively as possible in retrospect the images of this unusually ugly incident were too graphic.
[00:27:03.675 --> 00:27:05.056]  Take a moment to think about this.
[00:27:05.136 --> 00:27:07.316]  Culture in general is more decadent than ever.
[00:27:07.637 --> 00:27:16.040]  The general public's bloodlust for violence and gore is at record levels, and Hollywood is eagerly feeding the addiction.
[00:27:16.912 --> 00:27:22.496]  Every new movie trend trumps the last in terms of bloodshed and butchery.
[00:27:22.777 --> 00:27:26.840]  Kill Bill, Dawn of the Dead, and Alien vs. Predator are just three recent examples.
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:32.164]  In contrast, the public's tolerance for graphic images of real violence is in fact decreasing.
[00:27:32.584 --> 00:27:39.970]  So why are the public hungry for fantasy violence, but more afraid than ever to see the real consequences of brutality?
[00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:48.579]  Thirty years ago, photos and film footage of crime scenes, murders, and the impact of warfare were commonplace in the newspapers and on television.
[00:27:48.899 --> 00:27:53.124]  Humanity was strong enough to witness the effects of savagery and thus able to embrace...
[00:27:54.562 --> 00:27:55.623]  The atrocities are not...
[00:28:16.929 --> 00:28:17.490]  Accidental.
[00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:19.331]  They are perpetrated by the authorities.
[00:28:19.752 --> 00:28:21.694]  The authorities are not here to protect us.
[00:28:22.054 --> 00:28:24.096]  They are here to attack and enslave us.
[00:28:24.496 --> 00:28:29.361]  This has been the norm throughout history, and there is no reason to believe it isn't happening today.
[00:28:29.881 --> 00:28:31.723]  This denial mechanism kicks in.
[00:28:31.983 --> 00:28:41.612]  They don't want us to see the photos because it conflicts with their God-given voice of conscience, which tells them that this is wrong, and they should have to do something about it.
[00:28:43.655 --> 00:28:51.258]  To avoid the conflict, the individual reverts back to a vulnerable childlike mentality where the state is the parent and the state can do no wrong.
[00:28:51.939 --> 00:28:53.940]  If they can't see it, then it doesn't exist.
[00:28:55.060 --> 00:28:57.121]  Denial mechanism has now been activated.
[00:28:57.421 --> 00:28:58.442]  Look at this photograph.
[00:28:58.462 --> 00:29:03.804]  The Associated Press described it as being taken at the same time that Victoria Snellgrove lay dying on the sidewalk.
[00:29:04.144 --> 00:29:10.687]  The police officer aiming the weapon is clearly no more than 10 to 15 feet away from a crowd of people firing projectiles
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:19.265]  Euphemistically described as non-lethal from a close range is guaranteed to cause serious injury or likely death.
[00:29:19.705 --> 00:29:29.733]  Police manuals state clearly that such weapons should in no circumstance be fired at this range because at this close proximity, you may as well be firing off a round from a 9mm.
[00:29:30.573 --> 00:29:42.919]  Furthermore, the close proximity strongly suggests the projectile was not just randomly fired into the crowd, but that this was in fact a targeted hit, of which Schnellgrove, who even police admit was an innocent bystander, was the victim.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:45.741]  We'll get to Jim Mars and finish this article.
[00:29:45.761 --> 00:29:46.721]  When we get back, stay with us.
[00:29:51.464 --> 00:29:52.424]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.864 --> 00:29:54.485]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.386 --> 00:29:58.067]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.215 --> 00:30:04.277]  Dad, that cocoon stuff really got rid of your gray hair.
[00:30:04.457 --> 00:30:10.982]  I'm that 44-year-old guy you've heard talking about taking Cocoon GH and how it helped reverse my gray hairs.
[00:30:11.082 --> 00:30:12.904]  And here's some more great news.
[00:30:13.004 --> 00:30:16.506]  Taking Cocoon GH can improve your life in many ways.
[00:30:16.646 --> 00:30:22.010]  Cocoon basically repairs your body to a youthful state you perhaps had 10 or 20 years ago.
[00:30:22.230 --> 00:30:24.792]  I'm taking Cocoon GH, and here's what I notice.
[00:30:24.952 --> 00:30:30.196]  After a few sprays in my mouth, I'm in peak condition mentally, emotionally, and physically.
[00:30:30.216 --> 00:30:30.696]  We're good to go.
[00:30:51.152 --> 00:30:51.252]  800-814-5031 800-814-5031
[00:31:01.044 --> 00:31:02.665]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:31:02.805 --> 00:31:06.906]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[00:31:07.047 --> 00:31:09.928]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[00:31:10.008 --> 00:31:16.731]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[00:31:16.891 --> 00:31:19.912]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[00:31:20.112 --> 00:31:22.513]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[00:31:22.633 --> 00:31:27.335]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove
[00:31:27.535 --> 00:31:42.106]  Try halo-methanes and volatile organic elements such as aptazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:48.952]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[00:31:51.834 --> 00:31:52.615]  803-4438.
[00:31:53.235 --> 00:31:54.576]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:31:54.996 --> 00:31:58.879]  Or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:01.941]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:32:02.121 --> 00:32:03.262]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:32:03.422 --> 00:32:06.844]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:32:06.944 --> 00:32:07.385]  Phenol.
[00:32:07.685 --> 00:32:14.830]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:15.210]  EDT.
[00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:19.192]  The FDA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:32:19.312 --> 00:32:19.772]  Fragrance?
[00:32:20.132 --> 00:32:24.895]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:32:25.035 --> 00:32:29.697]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration to name a few.
[00:32:29.938 --> 00:32:32.359]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal-Ben shampoo.
[00:32:32.759 --> 00:32:36.160]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal Bend Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:39.881]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[00:32:40.061 --> 00:32:42.402]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[00:32:42.582 --> 00:32:43.462]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:32:43.582 --> 00:32:53.324]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Cal Bend Pure Soaps.
[00:32:53.524 --> 00:32:56.005]  Call Cal Bend toll free, 1-800-340-7091 or visit calbendpuresoap.com.
[00:33:01.569 --> 00:33:07.214]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:10.897 --> 00:33:19.504]  For the next hour, we're going to have Jim Mars, award-winning author, best-selling author, researcher, on with us.
[00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:25.289]  He's a fellow Texan, just like myself, and of course we also have Tex Mars here in Austin, Texas.
[00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:28.432]  Mr. Mars is up in North Texas in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
[00:33:29.171 --> 00:33:30.712]  He's actually out on the road right now.
[00:33:30.732 --> 00:33:38.679]  We'll talk about a whole list of issues, his new powerful 9-11 book, what he thinks about the staged election, all of it, and of course your phone calls.
[00:33:38.699 --> 00:33:42.342]  I wanted to finish up though with my comments about Ms.
[00:33:42.382 --> 00:33:52.770]  Snellgrove, the 21-year-old journalism student who was shot dead by a lethal weapon, by a firearm, for absolutely no reason last week.
[00:33:54.423 --> 00:33:59.787]  But it's not just the story of police in every major city and even small towns having these weapons, people dying every month.
[00:34:00.028 --> 00:34:03.070]  Every month I see articles where they kill somebody with rubber bullets.
[00:34:03.531 --> 00:34:04.511]  Everybody knows this.
[00:34:05.512 --> 00:34:10.957]  There's also the evidence of them being only about 15, 20 feet from her when they shot her in the head.
[00:34:11.277 --> 00:34:16.081]  We have photos of them up close to crowds, 15, 20 feet away, shooting at crowds.
[00:34:16.461 --> 00:34:17.182]  This is criminal.
[00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:19.664]  They've been given the training, or at least they should have,
[00:34:22.037 --> 00:34:36.688]  The bigger story here is that non-lethal weapons are being used to train the police to attack the public and to give the public images of men in black ski masks and armored Darth Vader outfits shooting at crowds and crowds running.
[00:34:37.008 --> 00:34:40.671]  These are all tenement square simulations over and over again.
[00:34:41.317 --> 00:34:51.966]  We have video in my film, The Takeover, of police beating peaceful protesters, old women with billy clubs, stomping on them savagely with pleasure, chasing women down on bicycles, knocking them off.
[00:34:52.626 --> 00:34:57.770]  It's like something out of Planet of the Apes, you know, where the apes are riding down the humans in the cornfield.
[00:34:58.131 --> 00:34:59.212]  It looks about like that.
[00:35:00.853 --> 00:35:10.661]  But the psychology here is that the public got distracted immediately off of them murdering her to how dare the Boston newspaper...
[00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:15.043]  Put a pretty tame photo of her at a distance laying bleeding to death on the ground.
[00:35:15.443 --> 00:35:18.286]  How dare them put this in there?
[00:35:18.306 --> 00:35:18.986]  They're bad!
[00:35:19.086 --> 00:35:23.129]  And then the neocon talk show hosts have been all over the country supporting the police.
[00:35:23.149 --> 00:35:25.071]  Well, this will teach them not to riot.
[00:35:25.131 --> 00:35:26.932]  Well, this is their fault.
[00:35:27.393 --> 00:35:29.094]  These non-lethal weapons are good.
[00:35:30.375 --> 00:35:31.476]  Defense of anything.
[00:35:32.443 --> 00:35:38.748]  And then we also have the psychology of, in the 30s, 40s, 50s, I mean, murder photos on the front page of the paper.
[00:35:39.108 --> 00:35:41.309]  People weren't against real violence.
[00:35:41.389 --> 00:35:42.310]  They wanted to know.
[00:35:42.610 --> 00:35:44.652]  They wanted the truth of violence to be known.
[00:35:44.792 --> 00:35:47.374]  People weren't as psychologically callous.
[00:35:48.715 --> 00:35:51.517]  But at the same time, they didn't want to see a simulated murder
[00:35:52.317 --> 00:35:56.702]  On the big screen, that was all very tame, because violence was a serious issue.
[00:35:57.282 --> 00:36:02.547]  Now, the general public loves total violence, the most sickening stuff you can imagine.
[00:36:02.567 --> 00:36:04.729]  Rape, murder is applauded.
[00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:06.751]  All of this goes on.
[00:36:09.203 --> 00:36:09.963]  It's funny.
[00:36:10.043 --> 00:36:12.265]  I've sat in movies during very violent scenes.
[00:36:12.525 --> 00:36:13.446]  People laugh.
[00:36:13.486 --> 00:36:14.327]  It's funny to them.
[00:36:14.627 --> 00:36:19.171]  But then when they see something real, like torture at Abu Ghraib, don't show it to us.
[00:36:19.571 --> 00:36:22.874]  Or our troops hung up dead from bridges, don't show it to us.
[00:36:23.174 --> 00:36:25.996]  Or somebody getting their head cut off, don't show it to us.
[00:36:26.036 --> 00:36:26.737]  That's horrible.
[00:36:26.757 --> 00:36:27.797]  Don't show it to us.
[00:36:28.598 --> 00:36:30.740]  So it's a real mental illness, my friends.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:32.041]  And so in closing...
[00:36:33.897 --> 00:36:39.565]  From the article that myself and Paul Watson wrote about this, it's on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:36:40.126 --> 00:36:45.093]  What kind of mentality does it take to shoot an innocent 21-year-old woman in the eye from close range?
[00:36:45.791 --> 00:36:46.291]  We're good to go.
[00:36:46.331 --> 00:36:46.471]  I think?
[00:37:06.796 --> 00:37:11.238]  Except there to be more and more protests and more riots in the coming years.
[00:37:11.579 --> 00:37:23.606]  While our right to own a gun in self-defense is questioned at every turn, the government is aiming, is arming to the teeth in preparation for larger confrontations in the future.
[00:37:24.027 --> 00:37:24.787]  Why is this?
[00:37:25.268 --> 00:37:27.269]  Do they have something planned so horrible?
[00:37:28.297 --> 00:37:36.521]  That sound wave and microwave weapons will have to be deployed in American cities to disperse people from an area and to herd them somewhere else?
[00:37:37.341 --> 00:37:40.202]  To the rest and relocation centers, as they're called in England?
[00:37:40.703 --> 00:37:41.703]  To the paddy wagon?
[00:37:41.943 --> 00:37:42.543]  To the camp?
[00:37:44.044 --> 00:37:48.406]  Police nationwide have been trained to do this to the American people, my friends.
[00:37:49.019 --> 00:37:51.361]  And then now we hear it being defended and promoted.
[00:37:51.701 --> 00:37:55.103]  O'Reilly says put people in prison that disagree with the government.
[00:37:55.163 --> 00:37:56.084]  I've got him on video.
[00:37:56.404 --> 00:37:57.645]  Michael Savage says it.
[00:37:57.905 --> 00:37:59.165]  Michelle Malkin says it.
[00:37:59.506 --> 00:38:00.486]  It's being promoted.
[00:38:00.506 --> 00:38:01.527]  We're being conditioned.
[00:38:01.767 --> 00:38:08.912]  And now we're being conditioned for a young journalism young lady to be murdered and then excuses to be made.
[00:38:09.452 --> 00:38:12.534]  Now, we're going to go to Mr. Mars who we now have here in just a moment.
[00:38:13.541 --> 00:38:19.208]  In closing, before we do that, I hope everybody will visit prisonplanet.tv and sign up today.
[00:38:19.769 --> 00:38:29.782]  Fifteen cents a day, you get all my best audio interviews from the show, my weekly TV report, all eleven of my films, a bunch of other great documentaries that we've been authorized to post there.
[00:38:30.642 --> 00:38:39.849]  My book, Paul Watson's book, all of that to be downloaded or to be streamed or to be read at prisonplanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[00:38:40.229 --> 00:38:45.633]  And it makes all the websites possible and funds our webmasters and our bandwidth and what we do.
[00:38:45.953 --> 00:38:47.394]  And I want to thank those that are members.
[00:38:47.974 --> 00:38:59.382]  And I want to ask those that haven't signed up to go sign up today or to get a hard copy of any of the 11 films I've made on VHS or DVD or any of the other videos I carry.
[00:39:00.316 --> 00:39:11.382]  Go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via the safe, secure online shopping cart, or call toll-free to get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, American Dictators, any of these powerful works.
[00:39:11.763 --> 00:39:17.566]  Get them, make copies, get them out to people.
[00:39:17.586 --> 00:39:18.727]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:39:19.687 --> 00:39:22.789]  Take my newest film, American Dictators, documenting the stage election in 2004.
[00:39:22.829 --> 00:39:25.371]  It is $19.95 for VHS or DVD.
[00:39:28.456 --> 00:39:34.658]  And if you order the first copy for $19.95, each additional copy is $5.95.
[00:39:36.218 --> 00:39:42.400]  To order four or five more copies to give as Christmas gifts, or holiday gifts, excuse me, politically incorrect.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:47.241]  So again, 1-888-253-3139.
[00:39:48.881 --> 00:39:51.302]  Let's go to Jim Mars, who I'm honored to have joining us.
[00:39:51.362 --> 00:39:55.383]  Jim Mars, new book, Inside Job, Unmasking the 9-11 Conspiracies.
[00:39:56.229 --> 00:39:58.310]  And the website insidejob-911.com.
[00:39:58.510 --> 00:40:04.693]  And, of course, then he has his other website that we'll tell you about.
[00:40:05.373 --> 00:40:07.134]  We are honored to have him on with us.
[00:40:08.015 --> 00:40:09.935]  Jim is a prolific writer.
[00:40:10.756 --> 00:40:12.176]  Jim, where are you right now?
[00:40:13.277 --> 00:40:17.399]  Believe it or not, I'm at Kent State University in Ohio.
[00:40:18.749 --> 00:40:21.591]  Wow, that's kind of poignant.
[00:40:21.631 --> 00:40:23.352]  That's where they like to kill women as well.
[00:40:23.492 --> 00:40:24.092]  That's right.
[00:40:24.312 --> 00:40:29.295]  And that's as a code of what you were just talking about, about the police and their weapons.
[00:40:30.035 --> 00:40:31.716]  I've just got to share this story with you.
[00:40:31.776 --> 00:40:32.257]  You'll love it.
[00:40:32.357 --> 00:40:43.042]  This goes back more than 20 years ago when I was a reporter in Fort Worth, Texas, which, comparatively speaking, is a fairly safe and secure and quiet mid-sized city.
[00:40:44.083 --> 00:40:47.585]  The police department there put in a requisition for a flamethrower.
[00:40:48.616 --> 00:40:49.497]  Absolutely true.
[00:41:07.523 --> 00:41:18.109]  Not only do we have this weapons proliferation, and, you know, let none of us ever forget that the United States today is the largest merchant of arms in the world.
[00:41:18.129 --> 00:41:18.990]  Right?
[00:41:19.190 --> 00:41:19.770]  You know that.
[00:41:19.970 --> 00:41:20.230]  Yes.
[00:41:20.691 --> 00:41:31.417]  And so, you know, here's just an opportunity to make, manufacture, and sell more arms to the police departments so that they can quell the citizens when they get restive under these...
[00:41:33.067 --> 00:41:37.531]  Under the increasing pressure of government and society.
[00:41:38.011 --> 00:41:39.352]  Well, that's really it, Jim.
[00:41:39.372 --> 00:41:47.860]  I mean, they know that they've got things planned that will cause more and more dissent, more and more unrest, and so quietly for the last decade...
[00:41:48.846 --> 00:41:52.828]  They've been militarizing the police, merging them with the FBI and CIA.
[00:41:53.148 --> 00:41:59.851]  They've been giving them armored vehicles, helicopters, and as you just said, they wanted flamethrowers.
[00:41:59.891 --> 00:42:04.253]  They call these weapons non-lethal, but everybody knows they're very, very lethal.
[00:42:04.713 --> 00:42:05.353]  Absolutely.
[00:42:05.673 --> 00:42:14.998]  And for your listeners, and I'm sure you're well aware of this, we also have these detention centers that are sitting around just waiting to happen.
[00:42:15.058 --> 00:42:15.878]  In fact, there is...
[00:42:16.574 --> 00:42:24.421]  One that I myself researched pretty thoroughly a few years back, located just west of Mineral Wells, Texas.
[00:42:24.701 --> 00:42:27.223]  It was filled with trailer homes.
[00:42:27.842 --> 00:42:40.473]  And when I contacted an officer with the National Guard, he informed me this was one of the detention centers they have ready to warehouse dissenters in the event of a national emergency.
[00:42:40.873 --> 00:42:41.954]  And I said, well, wait a minute.
[00:42:41.994 --> 00:42:50.261]  If you're going to warehouse people temporarily, why don't they just have a tent city or build some of those wooden barracks, you know, like they had during World War II?
[00:42:50.781 --> 00:42:52.102]  He said, you don't understand.
[00:42:52.403 --> 00:42:53.884]  He said, these are for families.
[00:42:55.623 --> 00:42:58.145]  And by the way, I have been to that center.
[00:42:58.365 --> 00:42:59.506]  I've looked over the fence.
[00:42:59.987 --> 00:43:04.731]  Thousands and thousands and thousands of portable buildings with bars on the windows.
[00:43:05.211 --> 00:43:12.577]  And then Newsmax actually got the purchase order almost three years ago for three one-million-man camps.
[00:43:12.597 --> 00:43:13.958]  The Army admits that they've got 12...
[00:43:15.365 --> 00:43:27.249]  Since 1986, open for business with federal prisoners, run by the regular army at 12 different bases, and now they're being promoted all over TV and radio as a wonderful thing for dissenters.
[00:43:27.289 --> 00:43:30.590]  And again, this was all being set up prior to 9-11.
[00:43:31.050 --> 00:43:32.531]  They have really been engineering this.
[00:43:33.311 --> 00:43:33.791]  That's right.
[00:43:33.831 --> 00:43:44.135]  It's almost as though they know that something is coming up in the near future, and they're preparing for it, and we're being told nothing except to continue to go shopping.
[00:43:46.514 --> 00:43:47.435]  Very well said.
[00:43:48.675 --> 00:43:52.158]  Your new book gets into 9-11, and I want to cover that in detail later.
[00:43:52.218 --> 00:44:00.623]  But first off, this new bill, which is in conference committee, it's an inch away from passing, for a new supernational ID card.
[00:44:01.243 --> 00:44:02.204]  Give us your take on that.
[00:44:02.824 --> 00:44:05.606]  Well, this is just one more step to the new oral order.
[00:44:06.566 --> 00:44:10.909]  For one thing, I think all they're doing is just codifying what's already there.
[00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:17.963]  When I flew up here I went to get my boarding pass and I've had nothing but bad experiences with computers.
[00:44:18.043 --> 00:44:22.826]  The very first time they talked me into using a computer generated boarding pass
[00:44:23.636 --> 00:44:24.197]  Yeah, I think so.
[00:44:43.694 --> 00:44:47.778]  They were rapidly having no choice.
[00:44:48.198 --> 00:44:53.603]  It used to be there would be six or eight counters and then maybe one or two of these machines.
[00:44:53.703 --> 00:44:57.286]  Now it's six or eight of the machines and only two of the counters.
[00:44:57.726 --> 00:45:02.570]  Before long, you're going to be forced to use the computer machine to get your boarding pass.
[00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:07.514]  Well, when I go to do the boarding pass, the first thing you have to do is swipe a credit card.
[00:45:08.074 --> 00:45:09.035]  And they said, that's okay.
[00:45:09.055 --> 00:45:11.097]  It's not going to charge your credit card with anything.
[00:45:11.556 --> 00:45:13.437]  But hey, what's on your credit card?
[00:45:13.457 --> 00:45:14.558]  What's on that magnetic strip?
[00:45:14.578 --> 00:45:16.739]  Well, they admit that that's for... Everything about you.
[00:45:16.919 --> 00:45:20.100]  That's for the identification, and they've now merged all these networks.
[00:45:20.421 --> 00:45:20.801]  That's right.
[00:45:21.081 --> 00:45:22.782]  And that's what this CAPS 2 does.
[00:45:23.142 --> 00:45:29.545]  I have a Kansas City Star article today where they admit that to get on the bus, you're going to need one of these cards.
[00:45:29.625 --> 00:45:35.248]  And Ridge two years ago said to have a job, to get on a bus, to get on a train, we're all going to have to have this.
[00:45:35.708 --> 00:45:39.851]  And when you order a pizza, they automatically run your name through a database to see if you're wanted.
[00:45:39.871 --> 00:45:40.531]  That's right.
[00:45:41.098 --> 00:45:44.719]  Another experience I had was I was out in New Mexico in the little bitty town of Roswell.
[00:45:45.159 --> 00:45:54.902]  All I would do is go in and buy some drinks and some snacks, paying cash, and the guy says, I need your driver's license.
[00:45:55.382 --> 00:45:56.642]  And I said, what for?
[00:45:57.302 --> 00:45:59.003]  Oh, he said, that's just our policy.
[00:45:59.623 --> 00:46:03.984]  And so it was either turn around, walk out empty-handed, or give him the driver's license.
[00:46:04.004 --> 00:46:10.306]  So I gave him my driver's license and watched as this guy plugged my driver's license into the cash register computer
[00:46:10.759 --> 00:46:14.264]  I was in Radio Shack buying a cable yesterday with one of my friends.
[00:46:14.304 --> 00:46:15.586]  He pulled out his cash.
[00:46:26.443 --> 00:46:27.384]  We're good to go.
[00:46:46.983 --> 00:46:53.889]  First they put in two of these self-booking counters, then it's eight of them, then they start getting rid of all the employees behind the counter.
[00:46:54.369 --> 00:46:55.971]  I flew to New York on Continental.
[00:46:56.431 --> 00:47:02.136]  We wanted to get one of the ticking agents, and she got mad and said, are you giving me a problem?
[00:47:02.396 --> 00:47:03.317]  I was being real polite.
[00:47:03.357 --> 00:47:04.858]  She said, you used that machine.
[00:47:05.398 --> 00:47:08.021]  And I wanted to say, lady, your job won't be here soon.
[00:47:08.461 --> 00:47:10.643]  When I was here a year ago, there was one of these machines.
[00:47:11.504 --> 00:47:13.105]  Now there were six of them.
[00:47:13.843 --> 00:47:15.083]  But I didn't argue with her.
[00:47:15.823 --> 00:47:16.724]  But here's the deal.
[00:47:16.844 --> 00:47:19.604]  Three years ago, Home Depot put in two self-checkouts.
[00:47:20.084 --> 00:47:22.525]  Now by my house, it's nine self-checkouts.
[00:47:22.545 --> 00:47:22.865]  That's right.
[00:47:23.045 --> 00:47:24.646]  And one person checking you out.
[00:47:24.906 --> 00:47:27.446]  And after 9 o'clock at night, there's nobody there.
[00:47:27.486 --> 00:47:28.406]  You have to use it.
[00:47:28.627 --> 00:47:32.167]  This is all part of the control where you have to swipe something to use it.
[00:47:32.407 --> 00:47:43.070]  And you know what I can't help but think about is that back in Baptist Bible school, you know, we were told in Revelation that no one will be able to conduct business without the mark of the beast.
[00:47:45.453 --> 00:47:46.554]  I just can't shake that.
[00:47:46.615 --> 00:47:48.757]  Every time it's like closer and closer.
[00:47:49.758 --> 00:47:56.066]  And what I can perfectly well see, and they're already bringing this up because I'm sure you're familiar with the chip.
[00:47:56.573 --> 00:48:01.075]  Which is that identity theft is the big thing right now.
[00:48:01.455 --> 00:48:03.376]  Somebody can steal your credit card, right?
[00:48:03.796 --> 00:48:09.959]  So to prevent identity theft, the next step is, well, let's get everybody chipped.
[00:48:10.319 --> 00:48:19.062]  And in fact, Club Med and some of these groups that cater to young, well-to-do people are now offering special perks.
[00:48:19.102 --> 00:48:20.063]  You get to go to the headline.
[00:48:20.083 --> 00:48:20.543]  You can get discounts.
[00:48:20.563 --> 00:48:21.043]  You do this stuff.
[00:48:24.124 --> 00:48:27.367]  Now again, Jim, you just covered something key here.
[00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:51.504]  We've gone from five years ago, you and I and others being nutcase kooks, because we read federal documents, we wrote about federal documents, of how the Pentagon said, we're going to sell it as security and as a fad to the young people.
[00:48:51.544 --> 00:48:53.505]  We're going to make the military and prisoners take it.
[00:48:53.805 --> 00:48:55.605]  We're going to sell it as a fad to the young people.
[00:48:55.665 --> 00:48:57.486]  I even have a 2000 document that says this.
[00:48:59.067 --> 00:48:59.387]  Now in 2004...
[00:49:00.805 --> 00:49:04.426]  They're openly saying, want to be a VIP, want a discount, got to have it.
[00:49:04.786 --> 00:49:08.707]  If you're going to be in the Mexican Judicial Justice Department, got to have the chip.
[00:49:09.007 --> 00:49:12.748]  It's all actually now happening in front of us, people.
[00:49:13.608 --> 00:49:16.369]  This is not sometime in the future.
[00:49:16.629 --> 00:49:17.389]  This is now.
[00:49:19.030 --> 00:49:22.871]  So we're now calmly on the radio talking about mass chipping taking place.
[00:49:23.715 --> 00:49:28.078]  And then all these neocon pundits are on the radio saying, Yeah, that girl's dead.
[00:49:28.098 --> 00:49:30.780]  That'll teach everybody a lesson with the Red Sox.
[00:49:31.201 --> 00:49:32.662]  And by the way, camps are good.
[00:49:33.202 --> 00:49:33.742]  Exactly.
[00:49:33.822 --> 00:49:38.206]  And the thing is, you know what I don't understand is why anybody still pays any attention to those people.
[00:49:38.266 --> 00:49:45.831]  I mean, you know, Bill O'Reilly even has a book out now addressed to young people giving them advice about sex.
[00:49:45.871 --> 00:49:50.795]  Of course, needless to say, he doesn't mention about trying to force some woman into the shower with him in that book.
[00:49:51.155 --> 00:49:51.695]  We're good to go.
[00:50:12.688 --> 00:50:14.450]  Well, you mentioned the Mark of the Beast.
[00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:21.895]  I tune into so-called Christian Talk Radio, and it's the Patriot Act is goodness of the Lord, and this new tracking system is good, just accept it.
[00:50:22.956 --> 00:50:26.019]  I mean, what did you think was going to happen when all this came down?
[00:50:26.039 --> 00:50:31.423]  Did you think the Beast system would... No, they controlled the so-called Christian leaders.
[00:50:31.964 --> 00:50:33.125]  Well, and picture this.
[00:50:33.165 --> 00:50:38.589]  What's going to happen when everybody gets chipped or has a national ID card?
[00:50:39.267 --> 00:50:42.290]  And then there is a truly national emergency.
[00:50:42.611 --> 00:50:54.102]  Maybe Yellowstone volcano blows and dust covers half the country and shipment of food and water is broken and you've got to go down.
[00:50:54.142 --> 00:50:58.147]  The only way you're going to survive is to go and stand in line.
[00:50:58.247 --> 00:50:58.627]  Stay there.
[00:50:58.647 --> 00:50:59.268]  We've got a break.
[00:50:59.668 --> 00:51:00.249]  We'll be right back.
[00:51:01.323 --> 00:51:05.690]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:05.850 --> 00:51:10.297]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.437 --> 00:51:14.844]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:14.884 --> 00:51:16.206]  The New World Order.
[00:51:17.989 --> 00:51:22.216]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.276 --> 00:51:29.227]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.347 --> 00:51:31.330]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:32.031 --> 00:51:32.892]  We're good to go.
[00:51:32.912 --> 00:51:33.952]  We're good to go.
[00:52:00.931 --> 00:52:01.572]  We're good to go.
[00:52:21.894 --> 00:52:27.920]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick and pets.
[00:52:43.576 --> 00:52:45.778]  Call now and get free shipping.
[00:52:45.818 --> 00:52:46.219]  That's 888-803-4438.
[00:53:01.809 --> 00:53:07.731]  Herbal Healer Academy is a global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[00:53:07.971 --> 00:53:10.212]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[00:53:10.412 --> 00:53:16.754]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[00:53:17.094 --> 00:53:17.754]  We're good to go.
[00:53:39.725 --> 00:53:40.365]  We're good to go.
[00:54:06.747 --> 00:54:08.509]  I tell you, this guy is right on.
[00:54:08.529 --> 00:54:09.610]  We're so honored to have him.
[00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:11.852]  Later in the next hour, we'll take your calls.
[00:54:12.312 --> 00:54:21.581]  He's Jim Mars, new book out, Inside Job, Unmasking the 9-11 Conspiracies, and the website that takes you directly to the book is insidejob-911.com.
[00:54:21.801 --> 00:54:24.364]  We're going to cover 9-11 in the next hour.
[00:54:25.024 --> 00:54:25.705]  Jim, the 2004 election...
[00:54:32.740 --> 00:54:33.761]  We're good to go.
[00:54:54.859 --> 00:54:55.119]  Absolutely.
[00:54:55.179 --> 00:54:55.599]  Are you there, Alex?
[00:54:55.619 --> 00:54:55.879]  Yes, I am, sir.
[00:54:55.899 --> 00:54:56.079]  Grab this.
[00:54:56.099 --> 00:54:59.341]  If you'll read in my book, Rule by Secrecy, which was published in 2000, long before the election...
[00:55:24.098 --> 00:55:46.217]  You'll find that at the time of the BCCI banking scandal, the Bush name was cropping up in that along with other prominent Americans and then President George Herbert Walker Bush, just like his son, dragged his feet for more than a year or more before he finally was forced to have an investigation of the BCCI bank scandal.
[00:55:47.158 --> 00:55:49.700]  And so finally there was a Senate committee formed
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:56:00.743]  And I quote the chief investigator for that committee saying that he had hoped to have a meaningful investigation, but that it basically turned into a whitewash.
[00:56:01.143 --> 00:56:08.065]  And guess who chaired the Senate committee that whitewashed the BCCI banking scandal and covered for the Bushes?
[00:56:08.365 --> 00:56:09.665]  John Forbes Carey.
[00:56:10.046 --> 00:56:11.466]  Absolute Demento.
[00:56:11.606 --> 00:56:12.486]  John Carey.
[00:56:12.546 --> 00:56:15.107]  So it's enough to make you wonder, and you know,
[00:56:15.532 --> 00:56:32.093]  These so-called debates, and they weren't debates at all, they were just forums and with carefully constructed and carefully choreographed performances by both Bush and Kerry with no attempt and certainly no allowance of free speech and freewheeling questions.
[00:56:34.326 --> 00:56:45.329]  It's enough to make you wonder if the Kerry campaign is nothing but just a straw man, just something to give us the illusion that there's really a choice.
[00:56:46.184 --> 00:56:47.865]  Well, I mean, these guys are cousins.
[00:56:47.925 --> 00:56:50.546]  They swear an oath to each other in this organization.
[00:56:51.226 --> 00:56:54.008]  Kerry was involved in committees covering up the drug trade.
[00:56:54.308 --> 00:56:54.688]  Right.
[00:56:54.948 --> 00:56:58.149]  I mean, he'd make a nice public statement, but then whitewash it.
[00:56:58.470 --> 00:57:01.431]  He's been a go-to guy for whitewashes all along.
[00:57:01.631 --> 00:57:02.231]  Exactly.
[00:57:02.291 --> 00:57:06.593]  So at the very best, what we have coming up here next week is you have a choice.
[00:57:06.953 --> 00:57:09.074]  You can vote for skull or you can vote for bones.
[00:57:11.744 --> 00:57:14.586]  You know, the poor liberals out there, they think Kerry's going to save them.
[00:57:14.626 --> 00:57:17.327]  He's for the Patriot Act, he's for the war, he's for all of it.
[00:57:17.507 --> 00:57:18.068]  That's true.
[00:57:18.088 --> 00:57:19.108]  That's true.
[00:57:19.788 --> 00:57:40.540]  Wouldn't it be great if we actually had a candidate who was on the ballot whose platform said, we will pull us out of Iraq, we will end the stupid war on drugs and release nonviolent drug offenders that will allow individuals to determine what their marriage status is going to be, not the state.
[00:57:41.447 --> 00:57:42.949]  And that we will legalize freedom.
[00:57:42.989 --> 00:57:43.729]  Wouldn't that be great?
[00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:51.356]  Well, it would be good if the federal government got out of the states, and then the states, the people in the states, could set up the states as they saw fit.
[00:57:51.456 --> 00:57:51.876]  Exactly.
[00:57:51.896 --> 00:57:54.859]  And then we all have a choice to go to what's... Well, you know what?
[00:57:54.899 --> 00:58:00.884]  The thing is, actually, such a candidate is there, and it's Michael Baradik, the libertarian.
[00:58:00.944 --> 00:58:05.688]  But, of course, he gets no ink, and as a result, he's just an invisible candidate.
[00:58:06.354 --> 00:58:08.976]  That's how they do it with Michael Perudka or Michael Bagnaric.
[00:58:09.036 --> 00:58:10.858]  They just don't give them any coverage.
[00:58:11.018 --> 00:58:11.498]  That's right.
[00:58:12.159 --> 00:58:12.639]  Amazing.
[00:58:12.659 --> 00:58:13.440]  We're about to break.
[00:58:13.460 --> 00:58:14.781]  We'll start the third hour.
[00:58:14.941 --> 00:58:20.545]  And if we can, Jim, I just want to keep it for the whole next hour because it'll take that much time to go over your new powerful book.
[00:58:20.605 --> 00:58:21.146]  It's amazing.
[00:58:21.186 --> 00:58:21.886]  I've got a copy.
[00:58:22.287 --> 00:58:22.507]  You do.
[00:58:22.527 --> 00:58:23.368]  And to take calls.
[00:58:24.048 --> 00:58:25.329]  And we're, again, honored to have you.
[00:58:25.389 --> 00:58:27.731]  Insidejob-911.com.
[00:58:28.372 --> 00:58:31.994]  Jim Mars, author, researcher, lecturer, joins us.
[00:58:32.014 --> 00:58:33.576]  We're going to do a whole host of other issues.
[00:58:34.236 --> 00:58:34.617]  Big Brother.
[00:58:34.637 --> 00:58:35.077]  Big Brother.
[00:58:59.761 --> 00:59:03.664]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.405 --> 00:59:05.286]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.986 --> 00:59:09.689]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:10.169 --> 00:59:14.233]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.683 --> 00:59:30.029]  All right, my friends, we're now into our number two of this worldwide broadcast, blasting out on the AM and FM dial from Providence, Rhode Island to Los Angeles, California, simulcasting on Global Shortwave, my friends.
[00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:35.012]  Global Shortwave during the day at 9.475 and at night 3210.
[00:59:35.372 --> 00:59:45.036]  And I just got notified that starting next week we're going to be on a new frequency during the day, 9080-something, and of course I didn't bring that to the office and
[00:59:49.622 --> 00:59:59.547]  9.985?
[00:59:50.502 --> 00:59:59.547]  Okay, that's the new frequency, 9.985, starting next week during the day, and of course at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:59:59.867 --> 01:00:10.653]  Inside Job, Unmasking the 9-11 Conspiracies, veteran journalist Jim Mars has dropped another bombshell on us, and I, again, have read the book and everything in it is documented.
[01:00:10.853 --> 01:00:13.375]  I similarly have reported on much of the same information.
[01:00:13.995 --> 01:00:22.041]  We're going to talk about this for about 20-30 minutes, then we'll open the phones for all of those out there that want to talk to Jim Mars, those holding, be patient, we'll get to you.
[01:00:22.722 --> 01:00:32.830]  Jim Mars, you've written a lot of books exposing this global crime syndicate, but Inside Job is really hard-hitting and covers what really happened on 9-11.
[01:00:33.450 --> 01:00:34.191]  Tell us about the book.
[01:00:34.739 --> 01:00:52.541]  Well, you know, first off, everything that's going on right now, legislation in Congress, the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan, the Patriot Act, Homeland Security, everything that people are concerned about, all stems back to one similar event, and of course that was the attacks of 9-11.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.962]  Now, believe it or not, I actually agree with President Bush.
[01:00:57.002 --> 01:01:11.150]  In fact, I feel like I'm actually working on his behalf, because on the afternoon of September 11th, he said, this is terrible and we must not rest until whoever was behind these attacks is caught and prosecuted.
[01:01:11.631 --> 01:01:12.771]  And I totally agree with that.
[01:01:13.052 --> 01:01:16.894]  But the ball-faced fact is, we still don't really know what happened on 9-11.
[01:01:19.537 --> 01:01:30.685]  When you go back and look at the history in the background, you find, number one, that Al-Qaeda, the so-called terrorist network that was behind the attacks, is a creation of our CIA.
[01:01:31.406 --> 01:01:45.676]  I also detail how that Osama bin Laden was actually brought to this country back in the 80s under the name Tim Osman and was armed and trained to help create and further the activities of Al-Qaeda.
[01:01:46.777 --> 01:01:47.818]  This we need to know.
[01:01:48.283 --> 01:02:12.201]  And, of course, if there was a state sponsor behind al-Qaeda, which is, of course, what the government has claimed almost from the day of 9-11, and this is the foundation of their arguments of why we had to invade Afghanistan and Iraq, what you're going to find, and this has been well established and even is pretty well hinted at in the 9-11 Commission report, that state sponsor is Saudi Arabia.
[01:02:12.805 --> 01:02:17.666]  We're told that 15 of the 19 hijackers were using Saudi passports.
[01:02:18.166 --> 01:02:24.108]  We know the 9-11 Commission says that it was not Osama bin Laden's personal money that was funded in al-Qaeda.
[01:02:24.248 --> 01:02:29.249]  It was Muslim charities that were founded and funded by the Saudis.
[01:02:29.309 --> 01:02:30.629]  But here's the smoking gun.
[01:02:31.249 --> 01:02:35.090]  In 2002, the top al-Qaeda chief to be caught to that date
[01:02:35.911 --> 01:02:36.471]  We're good to go.
[01:02:36.511 --> 01:02:37.632]  We're good to go.
[01:02:37.652 --> 01:02:38.272]  We're good to go.
[01:02:58.539 --> 01:02:59.019]  Okay.
[01:02:59.099 --> 01:03:06.064]  Now, this is incredible information, and this is important for people to understand that all is not as it seems.
[01:03:06.744 --> 01:03:10.627]  And, of course, then we get to the actual attacks themselves.
[01:03:11.027 --> 01:03:12.768]  I'm not even going to go into the Pentagon.
[01:03:12.808 --> 01:03:15.550]  There are so many questions there that have not been answered.
[01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:18.992]  It could be answered pretty quickly and pretty simply.
[01:03:19.702 --> 01:03:35.416]  Alex, you know as well as I do that after every major air disaster, the one thing they do is the National Transportation Safety Board and FAA, they gather up the wreckage and they take it to some big hangar and they reassemble the plane to find out exactly what happened.
[01:03:36.016 --> 01:03:40.139]  Show me a picture of Flight 77 in a hanger, the pieces.
[01:03:40.199 --> 01:03:44.502]  Just show me a picture of those pieces, and I will shut up about what happened at the Pentagon.
[01:03:44.702 --> 01:03:48.865]  Or show us all the video cameras from all the hotels and gas stations or the Pentagon.
[01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:50.486]  We'll be right back with Jim Mars.
[01:03:50.506 --> 01:03:52.007]  We'll get into 9-11 and your calls.
[01:03:53.502 --> 01:04:00.347]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here, and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:04:00.667 --> 01:04:02.028]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:04:02.228 --> 01:04:04.449]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:04:04.589 --> 01:04:06.671]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:04:06.951 --> 01:04:11.894]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:04:12.234 --> 01:04:16.257]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:04:16.517 --> 01:04:18.279]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:04:18.359 --> 01:04:29.007]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plannable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:04:29.168 --> 01:04:31.069]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.

[01:06:42.698 --> 01:06:43.238]  Call today.
[01:06:43.258 --> 01:06:47.179]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:47.199 --> 01:06:48.860]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:07:03.041 --> 01:07:06.663]  We're talking to Jim Mars, investigative journalist, best-selling author.
[01:07:09.265 --> 01:07:11.206]  He's out at Kent State University right now.
[01:07:11.266 --> 01:07:15.609]  Left his home in Fort Worth, Texas to give a big speech that's coming up.
[01:07:15.629 --> 01:07:16.449]  We'll tell you about that.
[01:07:17.710 --> 01:07:21.792]  But Jim said he's not going to really get into the Pentagon because, well, that's a whole other separate area.
[01:07:21.812 --> 01:07:31.578]  But he did mention the fact that every time a plane crashes, they gather all the pieces together, the steel and other items together,
[01:07:32.190 --> 01:07:34.871]  Even from the worst crashes, and they assemble them in a hanger.
[01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:42.956]  But on 9-11, this supposed big old passenger jet hits it, and there's not a single piece left.
[01:07:42.996 --> 01:07:47.718]  They have like one little photo of a piece of aluminum on the ground that has red, white, and blue on it.
[01:07:48.726 --> 01:07:54.930]  And then under national security, they went and grabbed all the surveillance cameras the FBI did from, what, three different hotels, a couple gas stations.
[01:07:55.430 --> 01:08:00.894]  And, of course, the Pentagon has cameras all over it, cameras facing right where the planes came in, but they will not release that.
[01:08:00.934 --> 01:08:02.795]  I'm sure they've got some video work going on.
[01:08:02.815 --> 01:08:05.316]  I'm sure we'll have a nice thing generated for us.
[01:08:05.677 --> 01:08:09.939]  A lot of the witnesses that day, I heard them on the radio, said, yeah, we saw a small jet or a small plane.
[01:08:10.379 --> 01:08:17.624]  Most of them said that, but some Rand Corporation employees and a few mainstream media reporters just happened to see this big jet flying and do this.
[01:08:18.317 --> 01:08:18.958]  Jim, please continue.
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:52.724]  Well, let's forget about the two World Trade Center towers and let's look at the third tower.
[01:08:53.404 --> 01:08:56.066]  A lot of your listeners are going to be going, what third tower?
[01:08:56.147 --> 01:08:56.507]  Building 7.
[01:08:57.047 --> 01:09:10.818]  Building 7, the Solomon Brothers building, across the street from the World Trade Center and in between was Buildings 5 and 6 that were indeed heavily damaged when the Twin Towers came down.
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:26.394]  Building 7 was a 47-story steel and concrete office building, and at 5.30 on the evening of September 11, it just dropped down on itself into a compact little pile.
[01:09:26.814 --> 01:09:28.135]  It was nestled between the U.S.
[01:09:28.195 --> 01:09:32.820]  Post Office and the Verizon building, neither of which suffered any substantial damage.
[01:09:34.796 --> 01:09:35.677]  What happened to that?
[01:09:35.957 --> 01:09:37.498]  There were no planes hit that building.
[01:09:37.538 --> 01:09:40.781]  There were no seemingly out-of-control fires.
[01:09:40.821 --> 01:09:42.543]  There was a few little fires in the building.
[01:09:43.143 --> 01:09:56.994]  What we know is that Larry Silverstein, the owner of the World Trade Center complex, told, and I have seen the interview on public television, he said the firemen came and said they weren't sure they were going to be able to get out the fires real quick.
[01:09:57.034 --> 01:10:00.057]  So he said, he decided, well, let's pull it.
[01:10:00.517 --> 01:10:02.659]  And we stood there while they pulled it.
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:03.620]  Okay?
[01:10:04.187 --> 01:10:09.751]  Now, this was obviously a designed and calculated building demolition.
[01:10:10.731 --> 01:10:21.819]  And I can also tell you from having covered numerous building demolitions that you don't run into a burning building and throw some explosives around and bring that building down onto its own tracks.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:28.904]  This means this building was pre-wired for demolition days, weeks, months ahead of time.
[01:10:29.484 --> 01:10:39.027]  Which raises the very real and serious possibilities that the World Trade Center was brought down by explosives, not by airplanes.
[01:10:39.127 --> 01:10:41.268]  Okay, let's stop right there for a second.
[01:10:41.308 --> 01:10:42.808]  Again, you covered this in Inside Job.
[01:10:43.228 --> 01:10:48.090]  In my book, Ascent into Tyranny, that I put out two years ago, we show the building, we go over the documents.
[01:10:48.570 --> 01:10:52.391]  AP reporters were told, get back my firefighters, we're going to bring it down.
[01:10:54.147 --> 01:11:00.575]  In about 11 o'clock in the morning, Mr. Giuliani got a call and was told, get out of the building.
[01:11:00.935 --> 01:11:03.919]  It's going to be coming down, too, when there wasn't even a fire there.
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:08.705]  Two small fires started, and then it imploded hours later.
[01:11:08.905 --> 01:11:09.505]  We're good to go.
[01:11:24.341 --> 01:11:32.703]  That weren't owned by Silverstein, literally 20, 30 feet on both sides of it that have light damage even when it fell.
[01:11:33.023 --> 01:11:40.404]  Then between it and Tower 1 and 2 were 5 and 6 that did have some damage, some great damage when Towers 1 and 2 fell.
[01:11:40.925 --> 01:11:44.765]  They did catch fire and they had buildings fall on them, but they still didn't collapse.
[01:11:45.086 --> 01:11:47.126]  So you have these buildings across the street...
[01:11:47.934 --> 01:11:48.954]  It's so far away.
[01:11:48.994 --> 01:11:50.515]  You've got to be there to experience this.
[01:11:50.775 --> 01:11:55.657]  They aren't even damaged, but right in the middle of them, all his properties were basically destroyed.
[01:11:55.937 --> 01:11:57.478]  This thing suddenly catches fire.
[01:11:57.538 --> 01:12:02.359]  The CIA, FBI, city, port authority, command center was there.
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:10.022]  They'd already pulled the brains of it out two days before for Operation Tripod 2 that was actually going on that morning.
[01:12:10.722 --> 01:12:11.463]  And then the FEMA...
[01:12:13.277 --> 01:12:18.965]  A spokesman later said, of course, on CBS that we were there the night before, before September 11th, for a drill.
[01:12:18.985 --> 01:12:20.067]  Then they said, oh, that isn't true.
[01:12:20.087 --> 01:12:24.252]  But then Giuliani got up before the commission and said, yes, that was all true.
[01:12:24.272 --> 01:12:25.955]  So these guys can't get their lives straight.
[01:12:26.667 --> 01:12:33.692]  And then on top of all of this, we have the seismograph showing the classical signature of explosions.
[01:12:33.732 --> 01:12:40.036]  But since you mentioned that PBS America Rebuilding documentary, we got this footage a couple years ago.
[01:12:40.076 --> 01:12:41.957]  We posted it on Infowars.com.
[01:12:42.197 --> 01:12:43.998]  There's a section about this on the sites.
[01:12:44.338 --> 01:12:45.959]  Here is Larry Silverstein.
[01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:48.621]  Now, again, this film is about rebuilding, folks.
[01:12:48.661 --> 01:12:51.623]  So they're describing how Building 7 was rebuilt first.
[01:12:52.769 --> 01:12:56.754]  Because it was the furthest away from the complex and completely fell.
[01:12:57.054 --> 01:13:06.705]  Then they cut to the day of the event, show video of Building 7 falling that afternoon at 5.30, and Silverstein says that we made the decision to pull it, gave the order and watch it fall.
[01:13:07.045 --> 01:13:11.490]  Then we'll play from the same documentary where months later they demolish what was left of 5 and 6.
[01:13:12.771 --> 01:13:23.039]  Where the engineer from the city describes pulling it as demolition, then we play Dan Rather, 30 seconds after Building 7 fell, replaying it, saying, looks like dynamite.
[01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:26.661]  Here is that first clip, ladies and gentlemen, of Larry Silverstein.
[01:13:27.122 --> 01:13:31.565]  World Trade Center 7 had always been considered a starting point for rebuilding.
[01:13:33.426 --> 01:13:42.013]  Located north of the slurry wall, 7 had been cleared faster than the rest of the site, and there had been no bodies to recover.
[01:13:46.121 --> 01:13:54.707]  Pelted by debris when the North Tower collapsed, seven burned until late afternoon, allowing occupants to evacuate to safety.
[01:13:55.948 --> 01:14:03.974]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[01:14:05.615 --> 01:14:07.576]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[01:14:08.637 --> 01:14:10.558]  Maybe the smallest thing to do is pull it.
[01:14:11.239 --> 01:14:12.079]  All right, go ahead and pause.
[01:14:12.139 --> 01:14:12.980]  And they made that decision.
[01:14:13.681 --> 01:14:18.364]  Yeah, for some reason, we're playing these off the computer file, because I told them to play the three clips separate.
[01:14:18.384 --> 01:14:19.225]  It's causing problems.
[01:14:19.625 --> 01:14:20.986]  This is what I want you to do, John.
[01:14:21.467 --> 01:14:23.208]  I want you to play them all back-to-back.
[01:14:23.228 --> 01:14:24.109]  Just go ahead and play them.
[01:14:24.409 --> 01:14:25.389]  Play them all back-to-back.
[01:14:25.550 --> 01:14:26.070]  Here they are.
[01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:29.552]  This is CBS and two clips from PBS.
[01:14:30.013 --> 01:14:31.254]  So, here they are.
[01:14:31.314 --> 01:14:32.395]  Go ahead and play them back-to-back.
[01:14:33.155 --> 01:14:37.598]  World Trade Center 7 had always been considered the starting point for rebuilding.
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:39.860]  Located...
[01:14:40.785 --> 01:14:48.088]  North of the slurry wall, seven had been cleared faster than the rest of the site, and there had been no bodies to recover.
[01:14:52.150 --> 01:15:00.715]  Pelted by debris when the north tower collapsed, seven burned until late afternoon, allowing occupants to evacuate to safety.
[01:15:02.015 --> 01:15:09.959]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander, telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[01:15:11.633 --> 01:15:13.595]  I said, you know, we've had such terrible loss of life.
[01:15:14.636 --> 01:15:17.840]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.541]  And they made that decision to pull.
[01:15:19.862 --> 01:15:26.288]  And then we watched the building collapse.
[01:15:27.470 --> 01:15:34.337]  By mid-December, the Department of Design and Construction had leveled World Trade Center buildings four and five.
[01:15:39.581 --> 01:15:41.342]  Oh, we're getting ready to pull Building 6.
[01:15:44.062 --> 01:15:46.423]  We have to be very careful how we demolish Building 6.
[01:15:46.503 --> 01:15:57.206]  We were worried about the Building 6 coming down and then damaging the slurry wall, so we wanted that particular building to fall within a certain area.
[01:15:57.266 --> 01:16:00.867]  Again, what you're seeing are high shots.
[01:16:01.127 --> 01:16:04.228]  Now, here we're going to show you a videotape of the collapse itself.
[01:16:05.068 --> 01:16:07.169]  Now we go to videotape the collapse of this building.
[01:16:10.133 --> 01:16:15.375]  It's amazing.
[01:16:16.675 --> 01:16:18.756]  Amazing, incredible, pick your word.
[01:16:19.716 --> 01:16:30.479]  For the third time today, it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much on television before when a building was deliberately destroyed by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
[01:16:33.175 --> 01:16:33.556]  All right.
[01:16:33.616 --> 01:16:37.860]  Again, folks, you can go to Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com and stream those off the web.
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:38.641]  That's what we were doing.
[01:16:38.661 --> 01:16:41.864]  We must have a lot of traffic right now because it was kind of hiccuping a bit.
[01:16:41.904 --> 01:16:43.726]  I apologize about that.
[01:16:43.786 --> 01:16:46.889]  But I have the video I ordered from PBS.
[01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:48.891]  It is aired about ten times on PBS.
[01:16:49.212 --> 01:16:52.775]  Incidentally, now they do not show that video and they do not sell it anymore, Jim.
[01:16:52.795 --> 01:16:53.156]  Go ahead.
[01:16:53.736 --> 01:16:54.237]  That's right.
[01:16:55.138 --> 01:17:04.530]  Now, if Building 7 was pulled, or in other words, a controlled demolition, then we have to consider that the World Trade Center towers were controlled demolitions.
[01:17:04.992 --> 01:17:08.954]  And I believe they were, and here's how they flummoxed even the experts.
[01:17:09.374 --> 01:17:15.657]  Because having covered controlled explosions before, they usually go from the ground up.
[01:17:15.737 --> 01:17:21.480]  They blow the ground floor, the second floor, third floor, etc., so that the building settles down on itself.
[01:17:22.060 --> 01:17:25.442]  In the case of the World Trade Centers, they simply reversed the process.
[01:17:25.522 --> 01:17:33.926]  They blew it from the top down, and this is what caused even some of the experts to go initially, well, that looks like a building implosion, but I guess not.
[01:17:36.042 --> 01:17:48.688]  And I've interviewed probably, I don't know, five, six different degreed, practicing structural engineers here on the show, and we have stills off Fox News, clearly of blast points as the explosives are going off, top down.
[01:17:49.128 --> 01:17:49.589]  Exactly.
[01:17:50.049 --> 01:18:02.175]  And I was in Washington not long back, and there were some two, three, or four New York firemen who came down to attend this convention where I was speaking, and we got to talking.
[01:18:02.655 --> 01:18:19.300]  And they all said that among the New York firemen they all still talk about the bombs and the explosions that were going off in series in the World Trade Center towers but that they've all been admonished not to speak publicly about this or they would lose their jobs and their pensions and everything else.
[01:18:19.935 --> 01:18:26.120]  I was in New York, and I would give these speeches in front of literally hundreds of police, and you see a few firemen walking around, and they looked scared to death.
[01:18:26.601 --> 01:18:29.223]  I saw some of them nodding their heads while I was talking, Jim.
[01:18:29.483 --> 01:18:29.704]  Right.
[01:18:30.044 --> 01:18:36.229]  They know, but it's the same thing that I saw in Dallas after the Kennedy assassination.
[01:18:36.610 --> 01:18:45.337]  Everybody in Dallas knew the Lone Nut thing did not work, that something else had happened, but they were scared to death, and none of that information ever got outside of Dallas.
[01:18:45.697 --> 01:18:47.459]  I saw the same thing in Oklahoma City.
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:51.354]  When I went up there to look into the Murrah building... We've got a break.
[01:18:51.394 --> 01:18:51.956]  Stay there, Jim.
[01:18:51.976 --> 01:18:52.558]  We'll be right back.
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:57.242]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here introducing you to the Black Berkey Replacement Elements.
[01:18:57.522 --> 01:19:01.004]  They're new and they're more powerful than any gravity filter element on the market.
[01:19:01.104 --> 01:19:05.047]  These powerful filters fit most gravity filter systems and can be installed in minutes.
[01:19:05.267 --> 01:19:11.430]  Black Berkey Replacement Elements are so powerful they remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[01:19:11.850 --> 01:19:19.755]  The trihalomethanes and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, styrene, chloroform, and MTBE are removed below detectable limits.
[01:19:20.175 --> 01:19:25.499]  Black Berkey filter elements also reduce nitrates and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum.
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:29.443]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:19:29.803 --> 01:19:31.664]  And the Black Berkey filters are reclaimable.
[01:19:31.704 --> 01:19:33.906]  Simply brush them up with Scotch-Brite pads.
[01:19:34.126 --> 01:19:39.070]  Normally $48 each, you get a two-pack for only $91 or a four-pack for only $173.

[01:21:06.676 --> 01:21:16.185]  Did you know they're now working on a chip to place under the skin of human beings that will let you buy and sell in a global economy without cash, coins, and checks?
[01:21:17.225 --> 01:21:22.727]  It's the coming 666 system called the Mark of the Beast in Revelation chapter 13.

[01:22:54.389 --> 01:22:57.130]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:22:57.150 --> 01:23:01.031]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:23:07.113 --> 01:23:08.313]  We're talking to Jim Mars.
[01:23:08.373 --> 01:23:13.275]  Sorry about interrupting him to play those clips, but I wanted to back up what he was saying and what his book gets into.
[01:23:14.286 --> 01:23:28.376]  You know, Jim, as you said with the case with Dallas or Oklahoma City or the First World Trade Center bombing, where they admit the FBI cooked the bomb and trained the driver, it comes out, but then no one's ever prosecuted in the government over and over again.
[01:23:28.456 --> 01:23:35.221]  But we have the owner, Larry Silverstein, slipping up or throwing it in our face, saying that they blew it up.
[01:23:35.681 --> 01:23:38.963]  We have the firefighters telling the press, get back, we're pulling Building 7.
[01:23:39.764 --> 01:23:40.985]  That was in the Associated Press.
[01:23:42.033 --> 01:23:47.756]  We have Giuliani saying they were told to get out of the building, and then clearly Tower 1 and 2 were blown as well.
[01:23:48.697 --> 01:23:52.799]  But do you think on purpose they throw this in our face now?
[01:23:52.819 --> 01:23:54.961]  Yeah, they're pretty arrogant.
[01:23:55.341 --> 01:23:57.342]  They almost to the point to where they don't care.
[01:23:57.382 --> 01:23:59.103]  It's like, we're in control, what are you going to do about it?
[01:23:59.603 --> 01:24:05.587]  Let's go back and look at the World Trade Centers briefly, and go back and look at the whole history of it.
[01:24:05.627 --> 01:24:07.928]  First off, they were a boondoggle from the word go.
[01:24:09.053 --> 01:24:13.254]  Once they were built, I know I've been to New York many times, and most New Yorkers hated the towers.
[01:24:13.314 --> 01:24:16.715]  They thought they destroyed the beauty of the skyline.
[01:24:16.755 --> 01:24:29.057]  But more importantly is when the World Trade Center towers were opened for business, it suddenly opened so much office space that land values in lower Manhattan actually dropped.
[01:24:29.378 --> 01:24:31.458]  So the whole thing has kind of been a white elephant.
[01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:36.463]  So in early 2001, though, they just about had a sale ready to go.
[01:24:36.483 --> 01:24:38.584]  They were going to sell the whole complex, okay?
[01:24:38.905 --> 01:24:49.731]  But it fell through because they found out that the towers had been built with asbestos in them, and it was going to cost more than a billion dollars to get the asbestos out of there.
[01:24:49.772 --> 01:24:51.993]  Well, of course, that's not economically feasible.
[01:24:52.333 --> 01:24:57.857]  So now they're stuck with these buildings they can't sell, they can't renovate, they can't do anything with them.
[01:24:58.417 --> 01:25:01.259]  And so Silverstein, the titular owner,
[01:25:02.034 --> 01:25:04.515]  Takes out three separate insurance policies on them.
[01:25:05.015 --> 01:25:12.199]  And to make clear, he only owed Building 7 in the past, right before 9-11, for just a couple hundred million.
[01:25:12.499 --> 01:25:15.480]  He buys both of them and takes out $3 billion in insurance.
[01:25:15.601 --> 01:25:16.221]  That's right.
[01:25:16.661 --> 01:25:22.584]  And in most insurance policies, they will not insure you against terrorist attacks because they can't predict them.
[01:25:22.964 --> 01:25:28.987]  But he insisted that all three policies had a clause in there that specifically said they will pay off
[01:25:29.437 --> 01:25:30.257]  We're good to go.
[01:25:48.433 --> 01:25:56.541]  So you can see the interconnectedness of the people involved with this thing and some of the motives that were in place for bringing these structures down.
[01:25:56.942 --> 01:25:59.344]  Well, obviously they do a cost-benefit analysis.
[01:25:59.384 --> 01:26:02.447]  They need something to target in a staged event.
[01:26:02.988 --> 01:26:05.190]  They pick something that's in economic trouble for them.
[01:26:05.230 --> 01:26:06.211]  It gets rid of a problem.
[01:26:06.512 --> 01:26:10.416]  Then Bush blocked the $97 million – this is admitted MSNBC –
[01:26:11.116 --> 01:26:11.916]  I know it.
[01:26:11.936 --> 01:26:16.798]  And then Bush has the audacity to launch his campaign for re-election this time, showing the first...
[01:26:32.102 --> 01:26:34.323]  Now, what was in Building 7?
[01:26:49.924 --> 01:26:51.604]  Well, there were CIA offices.
[01:26:51.644 --> 01:26:57.506]  There was Mayor Giuliani's fortified bunker, which he never even used.
[01:26:58.006 --> 01:27:03.307]  But there was also, and this is the most important, offices of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
[01:27:03.687 --> 01:27:06.448]  And guess what was lost when Building 7 came down?
[01:27:06.568 --> 01:27:08.668]  Enron, WorldCom, all of it.
[01:27:08.908 --> 01:27:09.628]  Exactly.
[01:27:09.828 --> 01:27:11.269]  All those investigations.
[01:27:11.509 --> 01:27:16.430]  All of those comms and all of those oil companies and all of those scandal-ridden...
[01:27:16.710 --> 01:27:18.974]  They always do things that are multifaceted.
[01:27:19.014 --> 01:27:19.735]  And then of course...
[01:27:29.582 --> 01:27:32.944]  Bush's younger brother ran security for the entire complex.
[01:27:33.244 --> 01:27:35.166]  His contract ended on 9-11.
[01:27:35.426 --> 01:27:37.427]  That was from two years before, set for that date.
[01:27:37.947 --> 01:27:44.732]  And then the uncle of the president, the former president's brother, he ran security at Boston Airport.
[01:27:45.392 --> 01:27:47.794]  So, boy, it just keeps happening.
[01:27:47.934 --> 01:27:48.474]  That's right.
[01:27:48.594 --> 01:27:50.755]  Now let's get to how could that have all happened.
[01:27:51.236 --> 01:27:57.920]  You know, how could 19 Muslim fanatics being directed by a cleric with a computer in a cave in Afghanistan...
[01:27:58.467 --> 01:28:03.409]  Defeat our $40 billion defense and intelligence budget, okay?
[01:28:03.810 --> 01:28:04.990]  Well, it's pretty simple.
[01:28:05.370 --> 01:28:20.217]  First, Bush puts Cheney in charge of a counterterrorism task force, which then puts him over the FAA, NORAD, all of the various agencies and organizations charged with our protection.
[01:28:20.698 --> 01:28:22.659]  And what happens on the morning of 9-11?
[01:28:22.719 --> 01:28:25.340]  They're running a series of war game exercises.
[01:28:26.741 --> 01:28:37.350]  To include sending most of our fighter interceptors out over the ocean or up into Canada because they're doing a Cold War scenario, even though the Cold War has been over with for 10 years.
[01:28:37.390 --> 01:28:43.915]  We'll be right back and talk about those drills and take your calls directly with Jim Mars, tell you about his book as well, Prison Planet.
[01:28:44.095 --> 01:28:44.996]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.476 --> 01:28:47.078]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.999 --> 01:28:50.681]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:56.221 --> 01:29:01.702]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[01:29:02.122 --> 01:29:06.363]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[01:29:06.583 --> 01:29:13.625]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[01:29:14.005 --> 01:29:20.107]  The Biosolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[01:29:20.247 --> 01:29:21.467]  There are no side effects.
[01:29:21.667 --> 01:29:22.128]  We're good to go.

[01:29:57.576 --> 01:29:58.076]  are located?
[01:29:58.296 --> 01:30:01.678]  And do you know the locations of the top 300 prime terrorist targets?

[01:30:53.544 --> 01:30:55.906]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:30:56.166 --> 01:31:00.008]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:31:00.328 --> 01:31:01.129]  Read the labels.
[01:31:01.569 --> 01:31:05.692]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:31:05.912 --> 01:31:10.095]  Also may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:31:10.475 --> 01:31:15.358]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:31:15.738 --> 01:31:19.321]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:31:19.501 --> 01:31:24.845]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:31:25.125 --> 01:31:27.847]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.

[01:31:43.078 --> 01:31:44.659]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:46.400]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:05.490 --> 01:32:09.760]  You know, I've got to have Jim on for two and a half hours of the three-hour broadcast someday.
[01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:11.384]  We've got Paul Watson coming up in about...
[01:32:12.254 --> 01:32:12.915]  27 minutes.
[01:32:12.975 --> 01:32:18.678]  We're about to go to Clayton and Tom and Tim and Bert and Vince and everybody else that's holding.
[01:32:19.158 --> 01:32:22.380]  Jim's just amazing, and he's right on with 9-11.
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:27.944]  And again, when I start throwing info in when he makes a claim, it's because I want to bolster what he's saying, folks.
[01:32:27.984 --> 01:32:29.425]  It's documented.
[01:32:29.705 --> 01:32:30.305]  It's real.
[01:32:30.665 --> 01:32:31.826]  We both have the evidence.
[01:32:31.846 --> 01:32:33.267]  This is public stuff.
[01:32:33.287 --> 01:32:35.228]  We'll be talking to Jim again here in just a second.
[01:32:35.748 --> 01:32:38.090]  Here's that clip one more time, isolated.
[01:32:38.843 --> 01:32:40.704]  We played it off the web earlier off InfoWars.
[01:32:40.744 --> 01:32:41.305]  It was hiccuping.
[01:32:41.505 --> 01:32:48.649]  Here's the isolated clip of Larry Silverstein, the owner, saying they pulled the building, gave the order, watched it come down.
[01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:49.670]  Talking about Building 7.
[01:32:49.730 --> 01:32:50.390]  Here it is.
[01:32:50.911 --> 01:32:57.135]  I remember getting a call from the fire department commander telling me that they were not sure they were going to be able to contain the fire.
[01:32:58.756 --> 01:33:00.737]  I said, you know, we've had such a terrible loss of life.
[01:33:01.778 --> 01:33:03.679]  Maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it.
[01:33:05.100 --> 01:33:06.641]  And they made that decision to pull.
[01:33:06.981 --> 01:33:08.342]  And then we watched the building collapse.
[01:33:09.855 --> 01:33:11.216]  And then you watch Building 7 Fall.
[01:33:11.256 --> 01:33:13.218]  Now understand, Jim Mars is a best-selling author.
[01:33:13.638 --> 01:33:15.039]  He puts this on his site, his books.
[01:33:15.660 --> 01:33:16.641]  I put it in films.
[01:33:17.141 --> 01:33:17.922]  I put it in my book.
[01:33:18.222 --> 01:33:20.144]  It's on my website, the clips of the TV show.
[01:33:20.604 --> 01:33:22.446]  I've been saying this now for two years.
[01:33:22.466 --> 01:33:25.088]  A year and a half since Silverstein made the comment.
[01:33:25.148 --> 01:33:27.590]  For two and a half years I've been making this claim with the evidence.
[01:33:27.930 --> 01:33:28.891]  We have it all posted.
[01:33:28.991 --> 01:33:29.832]  Say he did it.
[01:33:30.132 --> 01:33:32.194]  We've called his office probably 15 times.
[01:33:32.714 --> 01:33:34.756]  And he will not comment on it to any media.
[01:33:34.776 --> 01:33:36.637]  No one in the media will not talk about it.
[01:33:37.178 --> 01:33:38.239]  I mean, if there had been a murder...
[01:33:39.367 --> 01:33:47.778]  And I was a suspect, and I went on TV and said, I killed her, and then somebody went out and said, he says he killed her, and if it wasn't true, wouldn't you defend yourself?
[01:33:48.318 --> 01:33:49.700]  I mean, it's just, it's bonkers.
[01:33:50.101 --> 01:33:51.682]  So we'll go to your calls here in just a moment.
[01:33:52.463 --> 01:33:54.045]  Folks, I've made 11 films.
[01:33:54.065 --> 01:33:55.067]  The 11th film is out.
[01:33:55.647 --> 01:33:59.412]  It's American Dictators documenting the staged election of 2004.
[01:33:59.772 --> 01:34:10.865]  This film will be more important after the election than it even is now because it shows the false left-right paradigm, how it's all staged, skull and bones, how they're identical on policies, just different on rhetoric.
[01:34:12.127 --> 01:34:13.088]  We get into all of it.
[01:34:14.545 --> 01:34:17.446]  And so you need to get this film on DVD and VHS.
[01:34:17.466 --> 01:34:22.048]  DVDs, 115 minutes, VHS, 95 minutes, $19.95 per copy.
[01:34:22.729 --> 01:34:25.430]  $5.95 each additional copy for the DVDs.
[01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:26.550]  Get four or five copies.
[01:34:26.890 --> 01:34:27.831]  Get them out to people.
[01:34:27.951 --> 01:34:29.071]  Make copies of my films.
[01:34:29.111 --> 01:34:30.292]  Just get it out to people.
[01:34:31.531 --> 01:34:32.491]  It is so important.
[01:34:32.812 --> 01:34:39.934]  Of course, there's my film, 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, part two of that, The Masters of Terror Exposed, that gets into Building 7, and much more.
[01:34:40.475 --> 01:34:44.596]  There's my book, 9-11, Descent into Tyranny, that covers 9-11 and the emerging police state.
[01:34:45.096 --> 01:34:52.079]  They're all on Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order via the SafeSecure shopping cart, or call toll-free to order 1-888-253-3139.
[01:34:52.099 --> 01:34:52.880]  Make the call.
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:54.640]  Expose these murderers.
[01:34:59.222 --> 01:35:00.722]  You know, they sit up there.
[01:35:01.262 --> 01:35:09.284]  This country has a Stockholm Syndrome, you know, where people are kidnapped by somebody and they finally love their kidnapper and will fight back against those that try to free them.
[01:35:09.764 --> 01:35:11.605]  You know, stop having the Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:35:11.965 --> 01:35:15.406]  Stop serving the man that knocks your teeth out with a crowbar.
[01:35:16.026 --> 01:35:17.786]  I mean, literally, it's pathetic.
[01:35:17.866 --> 01:35:19.026]  Stop being cowards.
[01:35:19.427 --> 01:35:21.527]  I don't mean our general listeners, but some of you out there.
[01:35:22.173 --> 01:35:23.114]  This is the facts.
[01:35:23.595 --> 01:35:24.295]  Join us.
[01:35:24.656 --> 01:35:25.997]  Major poll New York.
[01:35:26.278 --> 01:35:28.140]  Half New Yorkers think the government's behind 9-11.
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:30.883]  67% think they have prior knowledge.
[01:35:31.283 --> 01:35:32.765]  And it's even higher in some groups.
[01:35:33.246 --> 01:35:34.627]  We're going to win this fight.
[01:35:34.927 --> 01:35:40.594]  But we can't wait 40 years for 92% of people to know the government killed Kennedy in major polls.
[01:35:41.368 --> 01:35:42.509]  We can't wait that long.
[01:35:42.529 --> 01:35:45.131]  We've got to get those numbers up now.
[01:35:45.151 --> 01:35:53.258]  1-888-253-3139 to get my videos, books, and all the other books and videos I carry.
[01:35:54.359 --> 01:36:06.389]  And again, you can go to prisonplanet.tv and sign up for a 15 cents a day membership there to get my book, Paul Watson's books, my weekly TV reports, my text reports, my best audio interviews, all my videos, other videos.
[01:36:06.449 --> 01:36:07.450]  It's a ridiculous deal.
[01:36:07.730 --> 01:36:08.791]  Prisonplanet.tv.
[01:36:08.831 --> 01:36:09.732]  Watch them all online.
[01:36:10.032 --> 01:36:16.278]  Jim Mars, before we go to all these calls, how do folks get a copy of Inside Job, Unmasking the 9-11 Conspiracies?
[01:36:16.939 --> 01:36:29.730]  Well, they can go to insidejob-911.com, which is dedicated strictly to this book, or they can also check out my personal website, jimmars.com.
[01:36:29.770 --> 01:36:33.514]  That's j-i-m-m-a-r-r-s.com.
[01:36:33.574 --> 01:36:34.615]  If you're not on the Internet...
[01:36:35.354 --> 01:36:37.154]  You can call 1-800-247-6553.
[01:36:37.694 --> 01:36:44.356]  One more time, that's 800-247-6553.
[01:36:44.376 --> 01:36:51.617]  Now, Alex, before we get to the calls, I've got one big question for you.
[01:36:52.177 --> 01:37:03.059]  What do you suppose is going to happen after next November the 2nd, the next day, if it is perceived by most of the people in this country that
[01:37:04.249 --> 01:37:07.971]  That the election was somehow jimmied, corrupted, or unfair.
[01:37:09.111 --> 01:37:11.932]  I am predicting riots in at least ten cities.
[01:37:13.673 --> 01:37:19.055]  I am predicting, if the people think that there's been some type of cheating going on, there's already a lot of violence.
[01:37:19.176 --> 01:37:21.997]  Al Gore is having to beg Democrats not to be violent.
[01:37:22.017 --> 01:37:24.978]  I mean, you know, their stage theater is angering people.
[01:37:25.738 --> 01:37:29.080]  And, again, to the Democrats out there, it is staged, folks.
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:31.441]  When Bush is re-elected, as I'm predicting...
[01:37:31.921 --> 01:37:33.242]  Yeah, I'm pretty much right on the same page with you.
[01:37:54.901 --> 01:38:21.527]  If there is a violent backlash, which is very likely if there's even the perception of misconduct in this election, or even if it's thrown for days or weeks and sent back to the Supreme Court, and that's exactly what the neocons would love to see, because then they can say, see, you know, we're the only ones who can bring peace and tranquility to these cities and to this rabble.
[01:38:22.967 --> 01:38:24.027]  I totally agree with you.
[01:38:24.227 --> 01:38:25.728]  We're going to go to calls here in just a moment.
[01:38:26.048 --> 01:38:27.549]  Anything else you wanted to add about 9-11?
[01:38:27.849 --> 01:38:29.009]  You brought up so many key issues.
[01:38:29.309 --> 01:38:33.290]  I want to just briefly say that they were running all these drills on the morning of 9-11.
[01:38:33.310 --> 01:38:40.733]  The CIA, this is the Associated Press, I got it from Stanley Hilton two months before it was in the AP from people he's deposed in NORAD.
[01:38:42.196 --> 01:38:42.436]  Right.
[01:38:42.556 --> 01:38:43.898]  And who was in charge of all that?
[01:38:44.038 --> 01:38:44.578]  Dick Cheney.
[01:38:44.818 --> 01:38:47.701]  Dick Cheney is at the center of the spider web.
[01:38:47.761 --> 01:38:55.528]  He's in charge of counter-terrorism, he's in charge of the war games, he's been... And then that leads us to the one more thing I'd like to add.
[01:38:56.068 --> 01:39:09.200]  You go back to when Dick Cheney was Secretary of Defense under the first Bush administration, and he issued a defense guidance policy paper which stated that with the collapse of communism, it was our obligation, nay our duty,
[01:39:10.285 --> 01:39:20.537]  To move troops into the Middle East, to invade Afghanistan, to force a regime change in Iraq, and to gain control over the oil resources of the Middle East.
[01:39:20.617 --> 01:39:22.379]  But that a crisis was needed.
[01:39:22.819 --> 01:39:23.160]  Right.
[01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:28.486]  And then in September 2000, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Pearl, all of these neocons...
[01:39:28.786 --> 01:39:45.174]  We're part of the Project for a New American Century, a neocon think tank, and they issued a position paper echoing the very goals that Cheney had set out back in Bush 1, but they added that... A Pearl Harbor event was needed to catalyze.
[01:39:45.234 --> 01:39:45.795]  That's right.
[01:39:45.915 --> 01:39:51.338]  Needed a new Pearl Harbor before the American people would accept this, and of course they got it on 9-11.
[01:39:52.498 --> 01:40:02.206]  And again, for those that just joined us, when I keep finishing Jim's sentences and he finishes mine, that's to show you me and Jim have only talked four or five times on other people's radio shows.
[01:40:02.706 --> 01:40:04.267]  My producer just called and set him up.
[01:40:04.407 --> 01:40:05.528]  I never even talked to him.
[01:40:05.768 --> 01:40:07.690]  And see, we're finishing each other's sentences.
[01:40:08.050 --> 01:40:08.510]  That's right.
[01:40:08.570 --> 01:40:09.691]  And I'll vouch for that.
[01:40:10.611 --> 01:40:18.055]  It's not that he's reading my book or I'm looking at Alex's DVDs, although I have.
[01:40:18.435 --> 01:40:22.997]  The point is, when you go and study the information, it's simply there.
[01:40:24.198 --> 01:40:24.758]  It's a fact.
[01:40:24.898 --> 01:40:26.499]  And then you have to get past the fear.
[01:40:26.939 --> 01:40:29.240]  And believe me, Jim, do you ever wake up in the middle of the night and go...
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:31.501]  Man, this is crazy.
[01:40:31.541 --> 01:40:32.421]  I'm really into something.
[01:40:32.641 --> 01:40:33.562]  This stuff is real.
[01:40:34.503 --> 01:40:35.803]  Life is really this nuts.
[01:40:35.883 --> 01:40:51.092]  People really are taking microchips to keep their jobs in law enforcement, and they really are building camps, and they really did run drills on the morning of 9-11 of flying planes into the very buildings that were hit at the very same time as the real thing was happening for NORAD to stand down.
[01:40:51.132 --> 01:40:53.313]  I mean, this is criminality out in the open.
[01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:57.536]  Absolutely, and I'm sure you're aware, Alex, that they have scheduled massive...
[01:40:58.036 --> 01:40:58.957]  We're good to go.
[01:40:58.977 --> 01:41:00.437]  We're good to go.
[01:41:00.497 --> 01:41:01.818]  We're good to go.
[01:41:15.365 --> 01:41:39.834]  The voting starts on the east coast, and as the sun moves western, it looks like that the Bush and the neocons might be facing a defeat, so all of a sudden there's a terrorist... the terrorist alert goes to red, there's troops in the street, they say, we have reports of a dirty bomb attack in some city, please remain in your homes, keep everybody from the polls, and then they get in by default.
[01:41:41.138 --> 01:41:44.639]  And again, we're not saying this is going to happen, but it could, because the White House told U.S.
[01:41:44.679 --> 01:41:48.541]  News & World Report three months ago the Capitol will be attacked.
[01:41:48.581 --> 01:41:52.102]  Then they said, well, maybe, and then no, now that's not going to happen.
[01:41:52.323 --> 01:41:56.064]  Then the same day they reversed themselves today and say, okay, it may happen.
[01:41:56.804 --> 01:41:58.725]  Again, they've got all their options open.
[01:41:59.245 --> 01:42:00.306]  It's incredible.
[01:42:00.326 --> 01:42:01.386]  Let's go to the calls quickly.
[01:42:01.426 --> 01:42:02.126]  Thanks for holding.
[01:42:02.427 --> 01:42:04.107]  Clayton in Missouri, you're on the air.
[01:42:04.147 --> 01:42:04.567]  Go ahead.
[01:42:04.788 --> 01:42:05.168]  Good morning, Alex.
[01:42:05.188 --> 01:42:05.888]  How are you doing?
[01:42:05.988 --> 01:42:06.228]  Good.
[01:42:07.689 --> 01:42:10.730]  I was watching NBC Evening News yesterday
[01:42:11.309 --> 01:42:16.450]  And a reporter named Lisa Myers did a report on Lyndon LaRouche.
[01:42:16.651 --> 01:42:21.932]  And she's all been out of shape because Lyndon LaRouche is receiving federal matching funds.
[01:42:22.092 --> 01:42:24.813]  And there's three things that really stick in her craw.
[01:42:25.513 --> 01:42:30.394]  The first one is that Lyndon LaRouche is saying that America is on the verge of an economic collapse.
[01:42:31.035 --> 01:42:34.136]  Number two, that 9-1-1 was an inside job.
[01:42:34.596 --> 01:42:39.337]  And number three, that the Queen Elizabeth was behind the Oklahoma City bombings.
[01:42:39.773 --> 01:42:43.854]  I'm not sure about number three, but I believe he's correct on the first two.
[01:42:43.894 --> 01:42:49.475]  No, it's absolutely true, and the question to Jim is, why would they bring this up in the middle of the election?
[01:42:50.115 --> 01:42:56.337]  Well, I think they brought it up because obviously the reporter was upset that he was getting matching funds.
[01:42:57.097 --> 01:42:59.598]  The point there, though, is simply, hey, he qualifies.
[01:42:59.658 --> 01:43:01.578]  Anybody who qualifies gets matching funds.
[01:43:02.069 --> 01:43:12.816]  I don't know why they should get upset about it, except that here's an outside voice voicing things that is outside the carefully crafted script of the Democrats and Republicans.
[01:43:14.517 --> 01:43:15.158]  Exactly.
[01:43:15.198 --> 01:43:15.998]  Anything else, Clayton?
[01:43:17.379 --> 01:43:19.120]  Second question to your guest.
[01:43:19.941 --> 01:43:24.584]  I believe that on September 11th that a technology is called Global Hawk.
[01:43:25.034 --> 01:43:28.836]  Well, we don't know which particular company, sir.
[01:43:29.176 --> 01:43:30.256]  That's just one company.
[01:43:30.316 --> 01:43:36.199]  But since 1958, they've been remote-controlling aircraft for drills to shoot down jets.
[01:43:36.819 --> 01:43:46.703]  JFK's older brother, Bobby Sr., he died remote-controlling in a B-17 loaded with explosives.
[01:43:47.063 --> 01:43:50.144]  He was in a chase plane with a P-38 Lightning behind it.
[01:43:50.165 --> 01:43:51.945]  I mean, they've been doing this forever.
[01:43:51.965 --> 01:43:53.346]  That was in World War II.
[01:43:53.906 --> 01:43:55.168]  Yeah, that was in World War II.
[01:43:55.930 --> 01:43:57.813]  So, yes, they definitely have the cape belt.
[01:43:57.833 --> 01:44:02.721]  In fact, in my book, Inside Job, I detail how in the summer of 2001, just a month or so before 9-11...
[01:44:06.010 --> 01:44:06.310]  It's ancient.
[01:44:06.531 --> 01:44:07.171]  It's totally ancient.
[01:44:07.271 --> 01:44:08.673]  Clayton, thanks for the call.
[01:44:08.693 --> 01:44:09.213]  Great points.
[01:44:09.253 --> 01:44:10.394]  Tim in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:44:10.454 --> 01:44:10.794]  Go ahead.
[01:44:28.362 --> 01:44:29.042]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:44:29.062 --> 01:44:29.502]  Hello, Jim.
[01:44:29.702 --> 01:44:30.083]  Hey, Jim.
[01:44:30.423 --> 01:44:35.524]  I recorded your Secret Societies on Coast to Coast, and I have listened to that at least once a week.
[01:44:35.564 --> 01:44:37.705]  Thanks, both of you gentlemen, for doing that show.
[01:44:38.605 --> 01:44:43.027]  What I found out here is like, we're through, it's Alice in Wonderland with these people.
[01:44:43.847 --> 01:44:44.887]  We're through the looking glass.
[01:44:44.987 --> 01:44:49.709]  Whatever they say, they think the opposite, and that is usually to be true.
[01:44:50.305 --> 01:44:50.545]  Yes.
[01:44:50.846 --> 01:44:52.027]  That's a good way to look at it.
[01:44:52.087 --> 01:44:56.733]  I'm like the fellow who says, I don't believe anything's true until the government denies it.
[01:44:56.993 --> 01:44:58.595]  Right.
[01:44:58.635 --> 01:44:59.095]  That's right.
[01:44:59.396 --> 01:45:05.503]  And, you know, you look at all the smoking guns in 9-1-1, the three things that stick out in my mind, the drills, the stocks...
[01:45:05.996 --> 01:45:08.699]  I know I'm repeating myself, but to stand at ground zero...
[01:45:21.890 --> 01:45:22.691]  It is unbelievable!
[01:45:41.661 --> 01:45:46.686]  And then you have to bring in Marvin Bush there and the Kuam Corporation that did security for those buildings, correct?
[01:45:46.746 --> 01:45:49.629]  Along with Washington Dulles and the World Trade Center.
[01:45:49.789 --> 01:45:54.033]  And you know, one of the questions is that, well, when would they have had opportunity to wire the building?
[01:45:54.053 --> 01:46:02.522]  Well, the weekend before, according to at least two people I've talked to who officed in the trade centers, they said that they had drills...
[01:46:02.962 --> 01:46:04.203]  They evacuated the building.
[01:46:04.223 --> 01:46:06.264]  They shut off all of the electricity.
[01:46:07.024 --> 01:46:09.385]  Plenty of time right there to pre-wire those buildings.
[01:46:09.425 --> 01:46:11.406]  That was in the New York Daily News.
[01:46:11.626 --> 01:46:11.826]  Right.
[01:46:12.026 --> 01:46:20.610]  And then also, not just that weekend, then they also shut down a few floors for like a week for special maintenance.
[01:46:20.930 --> 01:46:21.190]  Right.
[01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:23.471]  It's just unbelievable.
[01:46:23.551 --> 01:46:28.273]  One quick question, if I can get off subject just for a minute, but maybe I just indirectly come back to it.
[01:46:30.108 --> 01:46:40.099]  I read your book, Alien Agenda, and a substance on the moon, Helium-13, they seem to be very interested in going back to the moon after they discovered all of that up there.
[01:46:40.159 --> 01:46:48.028]  Are they trying to get Halliburton in control of this Helium-13 as possibly the next energy source after they find the last drop of oil?
[01:46:48.433 --> 01:46:56.315]  Yeah, now you're touching on the deepest, darkest secret going, which is the manipulation of energy at the atomic or subatomic level.
[01:46:56.735 --> 01:47:02.977]  You're into zero-point energy, and you're into the molecular structure that they may be able to tap to get free energy.
[01:47:02.997 --> 01:47:04.778]  And, of course, they don't want us to know about this.
[01:47:04.858 --> 01:47:09.919]  Arthur C. Clarke, the inventor of the communication satellite, says that he's already seen the evidence.
[01:47:09.959 --> 01:47:11.180]  They already have zero-point.
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:11.740]  Yes.
[01:47:12.426 --> 01:47:21.273]  But they don't want us to know that because, number one, we demand an end to the oil economy, and number two, they'd all lose their jobs and their monopolies.
[01:47:21.573 --> 01:47:25.216]  By the way, I mean, I hope to see Clark wasn't just a science fiction writer, because he's still alive.
[01:47:26.337 --> 01:47:28.739]  That guy still has top security clearances.
[01:47:29.219 --> 01:47:29.459]  Right.
[01:47:29.879 --> 01:47:31.020]  He's one of their little futurists.
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:32.221]  Thanks for the call, Tim.
[01:47:32.822 --> 01:47:34.183]  Let's talk to Tom in Boston.
[01:47:34.223 --> 01:47:35.684]  Tom, thanks for holding for Eons.
[01:47:35.704 --> 01:47:36.905]  You're on the air with Jim Myers.
[01:47:38.164 --> 01:47:42.228]  I can't believe that I'm talking to two Texas heroes at the same time.
[01:47:42.268 --> 01:47:43.350]  This is really awesome.
[01:47:45.239 --> 01:47:48.022]  When I called in, I actually didn't know that Jim was on the show.
[01:47:48.622 --> 01:47:49.483]  It's real funny.
[01:47:49.523 --> 01:47:57.991]  We had Alex here in Boston, you know, where all the young kids learn to, you know, a lot of them are going to be these Illuminati pawns.
[01:47:58.031 --> 01:48:02.736]  We had Alex for about three months, and then suddenly that turned into Mexican radio without warning.
[01:48:02.756 --> 01:48:07.360]  It was all in Spanish, and he just disappeared.
[01:48:07.581 --> 01:48:09.623]  I've been listening to him online ever since.
[01:48:11.203 --> 01:48:19.727]  Actually, I had called in with a little bit of the Snellgrove story, which I think... Well, I'm glad you called because I wanted to get Jim to talk about a story.
[01:48:19.767 --> 01:48:23.528]  He worked for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and he told a story of years ago.
[01:48:24.508 --> 01:48:27.530]  Briefly, tell that story one more time and how it ties into Snellgrove.
[01:48:27.850 --> 01:48:28.070]  Right.
[01:48:28.130 --> 01:48:31.971]  Well, it just gives us some insight into police mentality, okay?
[01:48:32.832 --> 01:48:39.254]  Having covered police for years and years, my caveat is that they have a tough road to hoe, and I really feel very...
[01:48:39.734 --> 01:48:41.497]  You're either with them or against them.
[01:48:52.572 --> 01:49:00.297]  And if they're sent against a crowd, you know, they don't stop to think, well, maybe these are just good folks who are trying to voice their opposition.
[01:49:00.437 --> 01:49:03.378]  Well, now they've been militarized, and a military kills an enemy.
[01:49:03.659 --> 01:49:04.159]  Exactly.
[01:49:04.299 --> 01:49:06.380]  A peace officer defuses.
[01:49:06.420 --> 01:49:07.021]  They're the enemy.
[01:49:07.041 --> 01:49:08.001]  We've got to do something about it.
[01:49:08.021 --> 01:49:15.806]  So what Alex is referring to is years ago in Fort Worth, Texas, which is one of the more moderate and safe, secure cities going.
[01:49:15.826 --> 01:49:17.707]  It's a pretty nice place to be.
[01:49:18.468 --> 01:49:23.979]  And the police department asked the city council, they wanted to requisition money for a flamethrower.
[01:49:24.720 --> 01:49:29.470]  And one of the council members, you know, says, wait a minute, what do you need a flamethrower for?
[01:49:29.975 --> 01:49:32.837]  And their response was, for crowd control.
[01:49:32.937 --> 01:49:36.359]  What an amazing question for Jim.
[01:49:36.399 --> 01:49:36.819]  Stay there.
[01:49:36.860 --> 01:49:40.662]  We'll come back to you, Tom, and then Bert and Vince and others.
[01:49:41.042 --> 01:49:42.543]  We'll be right back with Jim Myers.
[01:49:42.623 --> 01:49:44.685]  I'm Alex Jones, prisonplanet.tv.
[01:49:45.365 --> 01:49:49.608]  And, of course, his website is insidejob-911.com.
[01:49:49.888 --> 01:49:50.889]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:54.691 --> 01:49:57.553]  What really happened September 11th, and who stands to gain?
[01:49:58.277 --> 01:49:59.578]  Alex Jones here, America.

[01:50:19.688 --> 01:50:24.333]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[01:50:24.433 --> 01:50:27.196]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies.
[01:50:27.496 --> 01:50:30.680]  Psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[01:50:30.740 --> 01:50:32.562]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.

[01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:03.081]  I was just talking to Jim during the break.
[01:53:03.101 --> 01:53:05.043]  He was saying us Texans got to stick together.
[01:53:05.083 --> 01:53:05.984]  He's a great guy.
[01:53:07.205 --> 01:53:10.508]  We're going to go ahead and go back to the callers that are holding here.
[01:53:11.426 --> 01:53:14.028]  In just a moment, we're going to keep him a little bit into the next hour.
[01:53:14.408 --> 01:53:16.609]  Paul Joseph Watson is joining us as well.
[01:53:17.110 --> 01:53:19.551]  I want to give all the callers a chance to speak their piece.
[01:53:20.072 --> 01:53:28.357]  But Jim, during the break, you were talking about the speech you were about to give this evening and how 7,000 people came out to hear Michael Moore, but there wasn't any information.
[01:53:28.397 --> 01:53:29.898]  Tell folks what you told me during the break.
[01:53:29.978 --> 01:53:30.638]  That's right.
[01:53:30.698 --> 01:53:34.821]  Well, he had Roseanne Barr with him and a musician.
[01:53:34.901 --> 01:53:38.023]  It was quite a happening, and it was pretty good, but it was kind of a...
[01:53:38.510 --> 01:53:43.572]  It was just a feel-good cheer, mainly get out the vote, which nobody can argue with that.
[01:53:44.013 --> 01:53:47.874]  And then, of course, a big, subtle campaign for Kerry.
[01:53:48.975 --> 01:53:53.957]  He had a whole rap he had about, goodbye Bush, goodbye neocons.
[01:53:54.517 --> 01:54:02.721]  And the only gripe I had was that here's 7,000 people who should have been informed as to the facts of 9-11.
[01:54:03.081 --> 01:54:04.362]  And just like in his film,
[01:54:05.504 --> 01:54:09.587]  He doesn't devote any space whatsoever to the events of 9-11.
[01:54:09.647 --> 01:54:11.048]  It's all about other things.
[01:54:11.809 --> 01:54:19.014]  That's why my talk is titled Beyond Fahrenheit 9-11, or There's More to the Story, Dude.
[01:54:19.034 --> 01:54:22.816]  How do folks hear that tonight?
[01:54:23.497 --> 01:54:28.160]  I'm at Kent State University at the Michael Schwartz Center Auditorium, 7.30 tonight, Monday.
[01:54:30.026 --> 01:54:33.990]  Students are free, and there's a sliding scale of $5 to $20 for admission.
[01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:35.812]  We're going to talk about the facts.
[01:54:35.852 --> 01:54:40.376]  We're going to talk about the very things that you and I have been talking about here on the radio this morning.
[01:54:41.117 --> 01:54:47.262]  By the way, as fellow Texans, let me tell you my biggest gripe about George W. Bush.
[01:54:47.643 --> 01:54:50.806]  That guy is no more a Texan than I am a New Yorker.
[01:54:51.226 --> 01:54:52.748]  Everybody thinks he's a Texan.
[01:54:53.088 --> 01:54:55.190]  They're Connecticut carpetbaggers, right?
[01:54:55.928 --> 01:54:56.789]  That's what I say.
[01:54:56.809 --> 01:55:03.973]  He comes down and loots our state and then springboards with all that massive money behind him and starts looting the country.
[01:55:04.353 --> 01:55:08.635]  Have you ever seen him when he slips out of the Texas accident and goes into that Atlantic accident?
[01:55:08.896 --> 01:55:10.096]  Yeah.
[01:55:10.436 --> 01:55:12.237]  Folks, I don't care if you're from the eastern seaboard.
[01:55:12.257 --> 01:55:12.818]  I love you to death.
[01:55:12.838 --> 01:55:13.578]  I'm not into all that.
[01:55:13.778 --> 01:55:18.321]  The point is I'm not going to come to New Jersey or Connecticut and start acting like I'm one of you.
[01:55:18.621 --> 01:55:19.101]  That's right.
[01:55:19.422 --> 01:55:21.403]  I mean, it's fake.
[01:55:21.783 --> 01:55:25.185]  Just as fake as this woman at Saturday Night Live lip syncing.
[01:55:27.036 --> 01:55:29.197]  Just as fake as Kerry out there duck hunting.
[01:55:29.837 --> 01:55:30.417]  Exactly.
[01:55:30.477 --> 01:55:31.817]  I mean, I'm tired of phoniness.
[01:55:32.238 --> 01:55:33.838]  Who was the last caller we were talking to?
[01:55:35.038 --> 01:55:36.178]  Tom, finish up what you were saying.
[01:55:36.198 --> 01:55:37.719]  We're going to go to Bert, Vince, John, and Fred.
[01:55:37.739 --> 01:55:38.439]  Go ahead, Tom.
[01:55:38.799 --> 01:55:39.519]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:39.599 --> 01:55:43.760]  I have to say that Alex is a big hero in New York, no doubt.
[01:55:43.800 --> 01:55:46.901]  I can't wait to see your new video, read Jim's book.
[01:55:47.461 --> 01:55:51.242]  Jim, there's one thing that you were talking about that just came to mind that
[01:55:52.647 --> 01:56:06.241]  I've probably read already five books, Alex's book on the subject, Paul Watson's, but the insurance angle, all right, I understand how that was set up, but the one thing I don't understand, and I will take my answer off the air, sir, is
[01:56:07.396 --> 01:56:14.683]  Why, with all this evidence out there, I've worked for an insurance company in the past myself, why didn't they say, uh-uh, we won't pay?
[01:56:14.803 --> 01:56:15.624]  I've got the answer.
[01:56:15.904 --> 01:56:28.215]  Because the insurance companies are the banks, are the system, just like the airlines are part of the system and kept their mouths shut, because the airlines got $25 billion, and because the globalists did deals to make the insurance companies more money.
[01:56:28.235 --> 01:56:30.578]  The insurance companies are the New World Order, Jim.
[01:56:31.338 --> 01:56:31.898]  Absolutely.
[01:56:32.199 --> 01:56:33.239]  You answered the question.
[01:56:33.339 --> 01:56:34.420]  It's all the same bunch.
[01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:34.860]  All right.
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:35.781]  Thanks for the call, Tom.
[01:56:36.001 --> 01:56:37.722]  Let's talk to Bert in Ohio.
[01:56:37.762 --> 01:56:38.402]  You're on the air.
[01:56:40.243 --> 01:56:41.324]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:56:41.364 --> 01:56:41.604]  Good.
[01:56:41.644 --> 01:56:42.064]  Go ahead.
[01:56:43.445 --> 01:56:58.454]  I just wanted to mention since Mr. Mars is in Ohio, we have a gentleman running for Congress here in Ohio, Jim Cotton, Jr., and he did a two-part series on Building 7 and
[01:56:59.525 --> 01:57:02.666]  And everything else that you all have well documented, too, last night.
[01:57:02.766 --> 01:57:07.048]  And I also mentioned something about a PBS interview with the Silverstone.
[01:57:08.929 --> 01:57:11.810]  We just ran that.
[01:57:12.590 --> 01:57:13.510]  Oh, is that what that was?
[01:57:13.530 --> 01:57:14.351]  Yeah.
[01:57:14.711 --> 01:57:15.191]  Okay.
[01:57:16.612 --> 01:57:17.052]  Thanks.
[01:57:17.692 --> 01:57:18.392]  Yeah, thank you.
[01:57:19.112 --> 01:57:19.653]  Finish up, sir.
[01:57:19.693 --> 01:57:20.533]  Go ahead.
[01:57:20.553 --> 01:57:23.774]  I just wanted to ask about Dr. Hugh Ross.
[01:57:24.575 --> 01:57:25.595]  I guess you don't really have the time.
[01:57:25.615 --> 01:57:26.435]  You're going to break now.
[01:57:26.875 --> 01:57:28.156]  Well, go ahead and finish the question.
[01:57:28.843 --> 01:57:35.246]  Okay, I just wanted to know if you were familiar with Dr. Hugh Ross' work, Slight Sky, Little Green Men.
[01:57:35.286 --> 01:57:36.447]  Because I've read his book.
[01:57:36.707 --> 01:57:39.088]  All right, we'll be right back to the third hour.
[01:57:39.148 --> 01:57:39.809]  Thank you for the call.
[01:57:39.829 --> 01:57:41.629]  We'll be right back with a few other calls for our guests.
[01:57:42.330 --> 01:57:44.411]  Big Brother.
[01:57:50.054 --> 01:57:50.634]  Big Brother.
[01:57:51.352 --> 01:57:52.392]  Mainstream media.
[01:57:53.113 --> 01:57:54.213]  Government cover-ups.
[01:57:54.873 --> 01:57:55.694]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.454 --> 01:57:57.334]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.354 --> 01:58:01.696]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:02.196 --> 01:58:06.318]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:08.078 --> 01:58:09.399]  Inside Job.
[01:58:10.119 --> 01:58:12.020]  Unmasking the 9-11 conspiracies.
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:13.240]  Jim Mars is our guest.
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:14.401]  Inside-job.
[01:58:15.061 --> 01:58:19.903]  Insidejob-911.com And, of course, we'll give you a toll-free number here in just a moment.
[01:58:21.198 --> 01:58:22.518]  This is his final segment with us.
[01:58:22.538 --> 01:58:24.039]  He's been with us for the last hour and a half.
[01:58:24.139 --> 01:58:25.039]  I guess some of you missed it.
[01:58:25.179 --> 01:58:27.400]  Then we got Paul Watson to cover all the news.
[01:58:27.420 --> 01:58:29.420]  The latest developments coming up here in about five minutes.
[01:58:30.241 --> 01:58:32.021]  Vince in Illinois, thanks for holding.
[01:58:32.041 --> 01:58:33.261]  You're on the air with Jim Mars.
[01:58:33.301 --> 01:58:33.701]  Go ahead.
[01:58:34.082 --> 01:58:35.362]  Yes, Mr. Mars.
[01:58:35.862 --> 01:58:42.484]  Your book was the basis for Oliver Stone's movie JFK, which was a masterpiece of filmmaking.
[01:58:43.264 --> 01:58:49.686]  And I was wondering if you have any direct contact or any line with Oliver Stone that you might be able to pass along your...
[01:58:50.800 --> 01:58:59.682]  I think that's an excellent idea.
[01:59:00.962 --> 01:59:08.643]  Yes, I have sent a copy of the book to him, but look at the grief and the flack he's gotten on JFK.
[01:59:08.903 --> 01:59:11.904]  It may be that he's a little tired of fighting that fight.
[01:59:13.364 --> 01:59:15.565]  I've actually had some contact with Stone.
[01:59:15.945 --> 01:59:17.505]  He's considered doing a Waco movie.
[01:59:18.211 --> 01:59:20.713]  But again, he'd get too much flack on that as well.
[01:59:20.733 --> 01:59:23.055]  Yeah, he's a great man, Oliver Stone.
[01:59:23.535 --> 01:59:26.718]  At the very least, Alex, maybe you can get him as a guest on your show.
[01:59:26.798 --> 01:59:32.562]  And all the listeners out there, if you've never seen JFK, that is just a contemporary masterpiece of filmmaking.
[01:59:32.622 --> 01:59:38.947]  Well, I love the summation at the end, you know, when the garrison character's laying it all out.
[01:59:38.987 --> 01:59:39.528]  Thanks for the call.
[01:59:40.388 --> 01:59:40.689]  Right.
[01:59:40.749 --> 01:59:44.371]  That summation was pretty much word for word taken out of my book, Crossfire.
[01:59:45.032 --> 01:59:46.733]  John in Ohio, you're on the air.
[01:59:46.793 --> 01:59:47.474]  Go ahead, John.
[01:59:48.769 --> 02:00:11.794]  Yeah, before I get to the Michael Moore appearance at Kent that I saw last night, I'd like to mention that last Saturday I was listening to Radio Havana Cuba on 6 on the shortwave dial, and they had a featured news item about the violation of the human rights of children and Americans through this Freedom Initiative, this drugging of school children.
[02:00:12.576 --> 02:00:14.318]  They quoted Ron Paul.
[02:00:14.538 --> 02:00:18.060]  Well, we're in trouble when Cuba's having to stop us from the police state.
[02:00:18.380 --> 02:00:19.421]  We've got about a minute left.
[02:00:19.441 --> 02:00:19.902]  Finish up.
[02:00:21.683 --> 02:00:23.784]  I was at that pep rally.
[02:00:24.965 --> 02:00:26.646]  That's a good characterization.
[02:00:27.187 --> 02:00:31.270]  Yeah, and I did see some powerful statements against the war.
[02:00:32.312 --> 02:00:42.658]  When he pointed out that this was a war that couldn't be won and should not be won, and the rage against the machine guests that he brought on said that these two millionaires are not going to end the fight against this sort of thing.
[02:00:42.698 --> 02:00:46.680]  So there was just a light, a small ray of light along those lines.
[02:00:46.981 --> 02:00:47.221]  Right.
[02:00:47.401 --> 02:00:58.207]  And I also wanted to point out that Michael Moore, I think, is suppressing, because I saw on the 9-11 truth.org website, which goes into a lot of this,
[02:00:58.772 --> 02:01:01.198]  That he apparently gave an endorsement to that.
[02:01:01.238 --> 02:01:02.542]  So he knows these things.
[02:01:03.038 --> 02:01:07.359]  And yet he apparently, for some counterproductive tactical reason, is suppressing it.
[02:01:07.700 --> 02:01:09.260]  Hey, look, I appreciate the call, John.
[02:01:09.340 --> 02:01:15.502]  I ran up to Michael Moore in New York, put a camera in his face nicely, and said, why aren't you talking about the NORAD stand down the drills?
[02:01:16.022 --> 02:01:18.243]  And he said, because that would be un-American.
[02:01:18.583 --> 02:01:20.944]  And then his bodyguards assaulted me, rammed into me.
[02:01:20.984 --> 02:01:22.044]  I ran right back into him.
[02:01:22.084 --> 02:01:22.845]  That's on video.
[02:01:23.165 --> 02:01:24.185]  Well, let me put it this way.
[02:01:24.265 --> 02:01:29.367]  I saw an interview with Michael Moore, and the interviewer asked him, what is your fondest desire?
[02:01:29.887 --> 02:01:33.269]  And he said, I'd really like to be invited to dinner at the White House.
[02:01:33.669 --> 02:01:35.590]  So that pretty well tells you where he's coming from.
[02:01:35.610 --> 02:01:36.771]  Unbelievable.
[02:01:36.851 --> 02:01:38.872]  Fred in Pennsylvania, you've got about 45 seconds.
[02:01:38.912 --> 02:01:39.292]  Go ahead.
[02:01:41.413 --> 02:01:50.858]  I just want to say that there is a patent that does cover a system to take over control of an aircraft.
[02:01:51.319 --> 02:01:53.340]  I mean, they had it in World War II.
[02:01:53.620 --> 02:01:54.680]  Yeah, they've had that.
[02:01:55.941 --> 02:01:57.102]  I wanted to ask quickly.
[02:01:57.742 --> 02:01:59.203]  What do people think drones are?
[02:02:00.241 --> 02:02:01.081]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:02:01.121 --> 02:02:02.662]  Yeah, I wanted to ask quickly.
[02:02:03.542 --> 02:02:18.387]  The Rick Burns film, New York, has a still, a color still, of an aircraft about to crash into the World Trade Center with a, I guess you'd call it a disc-shaped rear section.
[02:02:18.907 --> 02:02:23.968]  Some people think that photo is a hoax, but I'm not sure, and I wanted to know if you heard about it.
[02:02:24.788 --> 02:02:26.609]  Jim Mars, give them the toll-free number to get your book.
[02:02:27.542 --> 02:02:33.545]  The toll-free number is 1-800-247-6553.
[02:02:34.206 --> 02:02:38.648]  My brief answer to that caller is that I've looked at films and several different photographs.
[02:02:38.668 --> 02:02:39.689]  You're going to have to stay there.
[02:02:39.729 --> 02:02:41.250]  You're going to have to break.
[02:02:41.510 --> 02:02:42.450]  You've got to break, Jim.
[02:02:42.490 --> 02:02:43.691]  Just stay there two more minutes.
[02:02:45.766 --> 02:02:49.730]  Are you concerned about the quality of air and purity of water in your household?

[02:05:54.941 --> 02:05:55.762]  You want answers?
[02:05:56.522 --> 02:05:57.402]  Well, so does he.
[02:05:57.422 --> 02:06:01.764]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:06:02.264 --> 02:06:06.346]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:06:07.919 --> 02:06:13.583]  All right, in about a minute and a half, a gigantic news blitz is coming up with Paul Watson and myself.
[02:06:13.623 --> 02:06:17.346]  Just all the news, cover it in rapid fire, then take your calls.
[02:06:17.366 --> 02:06:19.707]  Give callers a little bit more time than they've gotten earlier today.
[02:06:19.727 --> 02:06:28.073]  It's just me and Jim Mars have had, or Jim Mars and I have had so much to talk about here with this new book, Inside Job, talking about 9-11.
[02:06:28.534 --> 02:06:30.235]  Jim, a caller called in.
[02:06:30.275 --> 02:06:31.556]  We hit that last break.
[02:06:31.996 --> 02:06:34.518]  Talking about missile pods, the rest of it, the Pentagon.
[02:06:35.399 --> 02:06:41.748]  I've mainly ignored all that, not because I don't think it could be possible, but because there's this mountain of other evidence that's 110%.
[02:06:42.909 --> 02:06:43.510]  Your comments?
[02:06:43.830 --> 02:06:44.051]  Right.
[02:06:44.491 --> 02:06:52.582]  Well, you're familiar with the Northwoods documents where they talk about taking a military plane, disguising it as a commercial airliner, causing havoc with it, you know?
[02:06:53.959 --> 02:07:03.369]  He was talking about the photographs that seemed to show some kind of object on the bottom of his plane, something that would not fit with a normal Boeing of that type.
[02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:12.138]  And I have looked at several different photographs from several different angles and all of the films, and there definitely seems to be some sort of anomaly on that plane.
[02:07:12.198 --> 02:07:14.601]  I've even checked with pilots who fly those craft.
[02:07:15.229 --> 02:07:17.090]  And we're not sure what that is.
[02:07:17.170 --> 02:07:23.272]  Something very strange about that, but nobody, myself included, is in a position to say, oh, it's this.
[02:07:24.193 --> 02:07:36.498]  One of the only theories I've heard that seems to make some sense would be that it would have been an extra fuel pod to add extra fuel to make sure that there was a huge ravaging fire that they could blame for the collapse of the buildings.
[02:07:37.711 --> 02:07:46.653]  All right, and we talked during the break about, I think we're going to win this thing, you think we will, and we talk to people in government all the time, they seem to be waking up at record levels.
[02:07:47.013 --> 02:07:56.014]  The globalists have got a problem if all their menus don't follow orders, which is another reason they're trying to go to automation, even with ground mini battle tanks and drones and everything else.
[02:07:56.294 --> 02:08:00.515]  By 2010, half the combat Air Force aircraft are going to be drone-controlled.
[02:08:00.695 --> 02:08:06.316]  That's right, and they're not going to say, hey, wait a minute, I'm not going to bomb innocent Americans, and I'm going to turn back.
[02:08:06.914 --> 02:08:10.339]  That's maybe another reason why the primary mission of the U.S.
[02:08:10.379 --> 02:08:13.344]  military is to defend the country, but they're not even here.
[02:08:13.744 --> 02:08:16.008]  They're in Afghanistan, Iraq, Kosovo.
[02:08:16.048 --> 02:08:17.770]  They're everywhere else except here.
[02:08:18.091 --> 02:08:22.758]  And that really concerns me because if something's... You know, at a recent meeting of the governors...
[02:08:22.998 --> 02:08:23.198]  The U.N.
[02:08:23.218 --> 02:08:24.959]  General McKenzie, the Wednesday after 9-11, seven, eight days later...
[02:08:43.599 --> 02:08:47.602]  I saw it on Nightline, scrambled for the tape, didn't get it.
[02:08:47.702 --> 02:08:51.285]  I tune in, and it's the head general, and Caller saw this too.
[02:08:51.385 --> 02:08:52.586]  I love the good tape of it.
[02:08:52.946 --> 02:08:57.289]  And he said, if there's an attack on America, we've been told we'll use our forces domestically.
[02:08:57.589 --> 02:08:58.250]  Then I've interviewed...
[02:08:58.610 --> 02:09:07.317]  Colonels who've been in the briefing rooms where they tell them this, the Joint Chiefs of State, we have foreign AWACS, foreign F-16s, they're openly ready to do this.
[02:09:07.497 --> 02:09:08.859]  This is real, folks.
[02:09:09.199 --> 02:09:10.720]  Now, we told you about the microchips.
[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:12.802]  We told you about all this years ago it came true.
[02:09:13.102 --> 02:09:18.146]  We're telling you they're set up for a red-dawn scenario, but our military won't be fighting them.
[02:09:18.166 --> 02:09:20.308]  They'll be our saviors here to take care of us.
[02:09:20.568 --> 02:09:25.212]  Jim Mars, tonight there at Kent State, you're going to be giving a speech.
[02:09:25.552 --> 02:09:26.433]  I wish I could be there.
[02:09:26.493 --> 02:09:27.374]  What time is it again?
[02:09:27.654 --> 02:09:34.399]  It's 7.30 this evening at the Michael Schwartz Center Auditorium at Kent State University.
[02:09:34.459 --> 02:09:41.865]  And after the election, we're going to have you back on to talk about your best-selling award-winning book that was then used for the Oliver Stone film.
[02:09:42.265 --> 02:09:43.026]  All right, Alex.
[02:09:43.086 --> 02:09:43.887]  Good talking with you.
[02:09:43.947 --> 02:09:44.947]  Good talking to you, Jim.
[02:09:44.967 --> 02:09:45.528]  There goes Jim.
[02:09:46.068 --> 02:09:50.791]  There goes Jim Mars, completely late because of us, to a meeting he had, but that's okay.
[02:09:50.811 --> 02:09:51.991]  We appreciate him joining us.
[02:09:52.291 --> 02:09:54.913]  Now shifting gears to another one of our wonderful correspondents.
[02:09:55.213 --> 02:09:58.735]  He's the webmaster for PrisonPlanet.tv and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:09:59.195 --> 02:10:05.598]  His brother, Steve Watson, with a different look and some different info every day, runs InfoWars.net now.
[02:10:06.438 --> 02:10:08.119]  My wife, of course, runs InfoWars.com.
[02:10:10.175 --> 02:10:11.196]  Well, hello, Alex.
[02:10:11.216 --> 02:10:11.697]  Good to be back.
[02:10:12.198 --> 02:10:13.038]  Good to have you back.
[02:10:24.830 --> 02:10:27.812]  We need to talk about this Victoria Snellgrove murder.
[02:10:28.212 --> 02:10:34.717]  You know, that's exactly what it is, as is detailed in this article, which we collaborated on over the weekend.
[02:10:35.417 --> 02:10:49.547]  There's also more rumblings from the direction of this potential staged Bin Laden capture, which we can go over, and obviously all the election news, with this being the last week in the run-up to the election.
[02:10:49.807 --> 02:10:53.950]  And now the Kansas City Star admits that you're going to have to have a national ID card to ride the bus to the...
[02:10:54.665 --> 02:10:57.127]  Or anything else.
[02:10:57.667 --> 02:10:59.289]  That's the system that they're putting in.
[02:10:59.329 --> 02:11:01.530]  I mean, it's amazing what level it goes to.
[02:11:01.550 --> 02:11:12.118]  I mean, I had an optician's appointment just last week, and now they're using retinal eye scans, which are stored in a database to check the health of your eyes.
[02:11:12.498 --> 02:11:21.185]  And they were completely bemused as to why I rejected such a thing, because, you know, they said, well, it's private, only we maintain those records, but
[02:11:21.923 --> 02:11:32.111]  Under this new national ID card, which is being phased in in Britain as well, that's a useful collecting point for the government to go ahead and start introducing that kind of program.
[02:11:32.151 --> 02:11:38.596]  So at every single level of society, this kind of mechanized Big Brother system is being forced upon us.
[02:11:39.336 --> 02:11:39.637]  It is.
[02:11:39.657 --> 02:11:41.358]  Let's get into Snellgrove first.
[02:11:42.239 --> 02:11:43.660]  So many facets to this.
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:45.281]  Give us your take on it.
[02:11:46.707 --> 02:11:53.253]  Well, yeah, we put together this article, which is on the website and was picked up by, looking at it this morning, several other big websites.
[02:11:54.193 --> 02:11:59.578]  And as you have outlined, there are two facets to the event which stand out.
[02:12:00.422 --> 02:12:02.823]  One of which is that this was no accident.
[02:12:03.003 --> 02:12:03.984]  It wasn't provoked.
[02:12:04.404 --> 02:12:09.507]  There were no mass riots taking place that would even bring anybody to try and justify it.
[02:12:09.527 --> 02:12:18.151]  No, the Associated Press admits, and we might add that article, there was an AP article that was headlined, Use of Force Now in Question, Use of Weapons Now in Question.
[02:12:18.451 --> 02:12:19.952]  They admit reporters were there.
[02:12:19.972 --> 02:12:22.393]  Nothing was going on at that site.
[02:12:22.413 --> 02:12:27.016]  In fact, we need to put a link to the story if it's getting a lot of attention to that to back up our claim there.
[02:12:27.256 --> 02:12:29.217]  They admit nothing was going on at that site.
[02:12:29.949 --> 02:12:37.392]  Well, yeah, as I put in the article, just go to the Yahoo Reuters AP photo wire, type in Red Sox Riot.
[02:12:37.832 --> 02:12:41.514]  They have three photos, well, they have four, but two are of the same thing.
[02:12:42.254 --> 02:12:44.875]  One of them shows a man with a bloody nose.
[02:12:45.375 --> 02:12:50.657]  The second is described as a fire which was started amidst the rioting.
[02:12:51.117 --> 02:12:52.198]  At a separate area.
[02:12:52.938 --> 02:12:56.221]  Yeah, but I mean, go and look at the photograph on prisonplanet.com.
[02:12:56.461 --> 02:12:57.522]  You call that a fire?
[02:12:57.542 --> 02:13:00.045]  You know, I've seen bigger fires inside a matchbox.
[02:13:00.225 --> 02:13:04.028]  In fact, it's so small, the police horses are just, you know, walking right through it.
[02:13:04.969 --> 02:13:10.534]  So again, this line that we were fed about mass riots isn't supported by any of the photographic evidence.
[02:13:11.335 --> 02:13:14.618]  And then the third photo, which is also in the article...
[02:13:15.339 --> 02:13:24.225]  Shows a policeman aiming this pepper spray projectile weapon no more than 10 to 15 feet away from the group of people.
[02:13:25.025 --> 02:13:36.292]  Now, as you said to me, Alex, isn't it correct that all these police manuals state directly that these so-called non-lethals become lethal when fired at such a close distance?
[02:13:38.253 --> 02:13:39.694]  And then you read the caption below...
[02:13:42.017 --> 02:13:51.280]  That picture, which shows the policeman aiming the weapon, and it says that the picture was taken in the moments after Victoria Snellgrove was shot.
[02:13:51.320 --> 02:14:04.045]  So whether it shows the actual policeman who did it or not, the orders that were given, or those orders that they didn't follow, were clearly to target people at close range, including this poor 21-year-old woman.
[02:14:05.245 --> 02:14:10.067]  And then obviously the other side to all this is the fact that the Boston Herald...
[02:14:10.669 --> 02:14:20.354]  Had to publicly apologize for printing the photograph of Nell Groves' body, which is being carried in other Associated Press photos, which are also in that article.
[02:14:21.155 --> 02:14:22.976]  Which, you know, was in no way graphic.
[02:14:23.056 --> 02:14:30.460]  Obviously, it was a tragic scene, but compared to some of the other things we see, amidst all these beheading videos, it was by no means graphic.
[02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:37.564]  So, this leads us back to the point that you brought up to me, the fact that the movies are more violent than ever,
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:44.262]  The fact that the violence in those movies has been mainstreamed to the point where it's almost a prerequisite.
[02:14:45.102 --> 02:14:55.964]  And these computer games where you blow someone's head off when you're face-to-face have developed to the point where both the graphics and the AI are as real as they could be.
[02:14:56.885 --> 02:15:00.486]  And yet, in the back of the mind, the user knows it's fantasy.
[02:15:00.906 --> 02:15:04.287]  And this fantasy violence feeds this bloodlust addiction.
[02:15:04.807 --> 02:15:05.867]  So when something real
[02:15:06.673 --> 02:15:11.254]  Like the Snellgrove incident has shown that in this case isn't even gory.
[02:15:12.334 --> 02:15:25.597]  The individual, ostensibly because they're cowardly and they don't like to consider for one moment in a kind of childlike fashion that the authorities are actively out to target them.
[02:15:25.857 --> 02:15:33.239]  So, you know, the self-defense mechanism kicks in and they turn away from the reality of it, from the truth, as you've said.
[02:15:34.201 --> 02:15:41.050]  Back in the 60s, crime scene photos, photos of warfare were all over the newspapers and television.
[02:15:41.750 --> 02:15:51.783]  So in this instance, this cowardliness manifests itself as a flood of complaints to the Boston Herald newspaper for simply publishing this photograph.
[02:15:53.220 --> 02:15:59.524]  So people want fantasy, they embrace it, but then when they see the real thing, they freak out, and the media uses that as a distraction.
[02:15:59.844 --> 02:16:03.606]  Now we're not talking about this dead girl and the use of these lethal weapons.
[02:16:04.026 --> 02:16:07.868]  Now we're talking about, they're the ones that are bad to misplace our anger.
[02:16:08.208 --> 02:16:13.051]  Now everyone's angry at the news, showing us the results of what actually happened.
[02:16:13.661 --> 02:16:29.672]  But whereas 30, 40, 50 years ago, crime scene photos were big in the newspapers, and the most bloody things you can imagine, people were not offended by that, but they were offended by fake violence in movies and TV, and it was not accepted because people took violence seriously.
[02:16:29.972 --> 02:16:34.195]  It wasn't that it was the image of it, it was that taking it lightly was taken serious.
[02:16:34.415 --> 02:16:36.256]  So we've seen a flipping of those things.
[02:16:36.877 --> 02:16:41.660]  And then on top of it, the third facet to this, is that neocon talk show hosts everywhere...
[02:16:42.541 --> 02:16:44.042]  Or saying, this will teach everybody.
[02:16:44.302 --> 02:16:45.383]  The police did a good job.
[02:16:45.403 --> 02:16:46.323]  They've done nothing wrong.
[02:16:46.704 --> 02:16:49.645]  I was on one of the biggest talk shows in the country, Man Cow, this morning.
[02:16:49.885 --> 02:16:54.708]  He said he's heard other talk show hosts and callers saying, ah, so what, you know, good job, whatever.
[02:16:54.728 --> 02:16:57.070]  I mean, so it's not just me that's hearing this.
[02:16:57.350 --> 02:17:01.252]  They're making excuses now for the dead girl who they admit did nothing wrong.
[02:17:02.133 --> 02:17:08.436]  Well, yeah, these are the same people that said torturing women and children was just blowing off steam.
[02:17:08.496 --> 02:17:09.417]  So what do you expect?
[02:17:09.477 --> 02:17:10.998]  I mean, they're trying to make light of it.
[02:17:11.584 --> 02:17:27.300]  Because again, they're going back to this cowardly fashion where, you know, if you really face up to what actually happened, then it's clear that we are being targeted and these kind of policies are being enacted where these non-lethals become lethal and it's all being geared towards crowd control and suppression of mass protest.
[02:17:27.580 --> 02:17:32.485]  Look, people dressed up like Darth Vader firing weapons at you is not freedom.
[02:17:33.226 --> 02:17:34.787]  And they're not your friends when they do this.
[02:17:34.887 --> 02:17:41.490]  This is meant to intimidate us, so when they take your pension funds and your children and your guns, you won't come out and stand against them.
[02:17:41.510 --> 02:17:44.091]  They're letting you know who boss is by killing this young girl.
[02:17:44.171 --> 02:17:44.832]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:47.513 --> 02:17:48.553]  The war on terrorism.
[02:17:48.874 --> 02:17:51.675]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[02:17:51.915 --> 02:17:56.077]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[02:17:56.497 --> 02:17:57.338]  So what do you do?
[02:17:57.638 --> 02:18:02.220]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[02:18:02.700 --> 02:18:04.821]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[02:18:05.321 --> 02:18:20.004]  Sheltering in Place, surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout, developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[02:18:20.044 --> 02:18:27.106]  government, gives you easy-to-follow video instructions, and walks you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.

[02:18:47.629 --> 02:18:52.213]  Explorers are willing to put all their wealth and skill into mapping every corner of the world, and they did.
[02:18:52.553 --> 02:18:54.895]  But you can still hold the world in the palm of your hand.

[02:18:57.037 --> 02:19:02.121]  Unlike explorers of yesteryear, you'll have a map to follow instead of relying on a compass and a north star.
[02:19:02.421 --> 02:19:03.642]  Get the Red Book of the U.S.
[02:19:03.702 --> 02:19:06.404]  Coins and you'll begin your journey to total financial freedom.

[02:19:45.692 --> 02:19:48.173]  David J. Smith for Newswatch Magazine.
[02:19:48.853 --> 02:19:57.456]  Has anyone told you how the Patriot Acts number 1 and 2 is the groundwork to eliminate all of our freedoms guaranteed to us by the Bill of Rights?
[02:19:58.416 --> 02:20:03.378]  Have you been told that they infringe upon the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, and 14th Amendment?
[02:20:04.438 --> 02:20:06.239]  This is minimum infringement.
[02:20:06.639 --> 02:20:07.419]  There may be more.
[02:20:08.422 --> 02:20:08.802]  516-8736 That's 1-800-516-8736
[02:20:38.836 --> 02:20:39.439]  Call now.

[02:20:46.235 --> 02:20:54.403]  You love your pet, and when your dog or cat starts to suffer from the debilitating effects of arthritis, you want to do everything possible to bring back their energy and spirit.

[02:21:46.328 --> 02:21:51.470]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:54.371]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:21:56.135 --> 02:21:59.657]  This is from MSNBC on Infowars.com.
[02:22:00.257 --> 02:22:09.562]  Old family trees take surprising twists and turns, but for sheer irony, nothing can match the paradox linking Dracula to Bush and Kerry as illustrated above.
[02:22:09.582 --> 02:22:14.904]  The common link is the royal house of Windsor, true name Saxe-Coburg-Gotha.
[02:22:15.164 --> 02:22:15.905]  That's the connection.
[02:22:16.605 --> 02:22:22.228]  Mr. Dracula, an ancient line that descends from princes and spawned generations of American elite.
[02:22:22.728 --> 02:22:24.069]  The writer Bram Stoker...
[02:22:25.319 --> 02:22:34.169]  Who wrote Dracula, folks, was just basing the fictitious blood-drinking character of Transylvania on a real man, Vlad the Impaler, who enjoyed torturing people.
[02:22:34.249 --> 02:22:35.831]  It was mainly for political purposes.
[02:22:36.412 --> 02:22:38.855]  The rest of his family, after him, liked to take baths in blood.
[02:22:39.415 --> 02:22:41.197]  Blood drinking became a fun hobby.
[02:22:41.257 --> 02:22:42.519]  And that's all historical and admitted.
[02:22:43.081 --> 02:22:44.202]  Well, that is the case.
[02:23:11.010 --> 02:23:21.172]  You know, in the week before the election, there's always this big Reuters report, which kind of collates the previous ones that were put out there, pointing out ever-closer connections between the two.
[02:23:21.992 --> 02:23:36.895]  And again, for anybody who thinks Skull & Bones is some kind of harmless old boys network, just go and listen to the BBC4, BBC radio programme, which they did on Skull & Bones, which included...
[02:23:38.792 --> 02:23:47.618]  Audio of one of the actual rituals which they managed to get... Ah, Satan, tell him devil equals death, death equals devil, death, death, now please stop!
[02:23:47.678 --> 02:23:49.339]  I mean, we've actually played that here.
[02:23:49.760 --> 02:23:56.945]  Yeah, which is, you know, ten times worse than the previous one we saw with the New York Observer, Observer and ABC News.
[02:23:57.025 --> 02:24:00.227]  Again, if your pastor was doing this just for fun, would you go to his church?
[02:24:00.907 --> 02:24:04.430]  Well, normal people, if they're invited to do that kind of thing...
[02:24:05.146 --> 02:24:16.637]  Not only refuse, but you know, instinctively, if they were normal people with a conscience... By the way, I've just got to say that there's a famous painting commissioned by him of Count Dracula.
[02:24:17.601 --> 02:24:23.882]  Even if you don't buy into any of that stuff, even when it's in your face, when Reuters are telling you about it, go and analyze their policies.
[02:24:44.594 --> 02:24:48.477]  You know, we went through 14, which are exactly identical.
[02:24:49.118 --> 02:25:04.189]  And now Kerry is basically calling what amounts to an invasion of Iran if he's elected president, where these plans for tactical strikes on Iran's nuclear reactors have been in place and have been what Sharon is pushing in Israel.
[02:25:04.449 --> 02:25:08.953]  So, you know, it's Bush times two is what Kerry wants to do.
[02:25:09.493 --> 02:25:14.317]  And so, you know, that's no surprise to us because, I mean, in order out of chaos,
[02:25:14.867 --> 02:25:22.091]  Two years ago, I predicted that Kerry would be up against Bush when the Democratic candidates haven't even been mentioned.
[02:25:22.411 --> 02:25:30.515]  And before Howard Dean had emerged as the clear leader, Kerry was probably back down in third, even behind Wesley Clark.
[02:25:31.416 --> 02:25:34.257]  So, I mean, we predicted this all along as to who wins.
[02:25:34.377 --> 02:25:39.660]  Well... Are you still sticking with your prediction that Lord Kerry will be our next leader?
[02:25:41.064 --> 02:25:52.915]  Yeah, I have to stick with that based on both the closer royal connection, although you rightly make the point that some of these bloodlines remain concealed, so, you know, Bush might even have closer than Kerry.
[02:25:53.576 --> 02:26:03.745]  Then, obviously, the selection of Edwards by the Bilderberg Group... Well, see, I think Burks is wrong, because Burks and the others show that Bush has more of a Windsor connection...
[02:26:04.457 --> 02:26:05.999]  Well, I think what we know for sure is
[02:26:19.224 --> 02:26:38.208]  If it is going to be Kerry, then that in a sense obviously doesn't mean a victory for America, but I think it means a kind of limited victory for us, because it shows that everybody's already woken up, many conservatives and a lot of liberals, to the Bush poison, and so they're going to try and change the poison.
[02:26:38.368 --> 02:26:43.028]  So this shows that they're reaching for the other poison, so it's a sign of discontent.
[02:26:43.549 --> 02:26:46.009]  They're going to put in whoever they want, and it doesn't matter.
[02:26:47.717 --> 02:26:50.144]  Well, no, but you know they've got lock and screw on it.
[02:26:50.185 --> 02:26:53.414]  When somebody like their man in Afghanistan, Karzai...
[02:26:54.128 --> 02:26:59.871]  All the other candidates are being threatened with physical violence before the election if they don't pull out.
[02:26:59.891 --> 02:27:03.172]  And then the whole election is run by vote fraud anyway.
[02:27:03.672 --> 02:27:06.594]  So, I mean, they don't take any chances with these guys.
[02:27:06.914 --> 02:27:08.775]  You know, they don't even need to worry about that.
[02:27:08.855 --> 02:27:15.417]  So, again, it underlines the fact that the political process is not the solution, it's the problem.
[02:27:15.437 --> 02:27:16.518]  But, I mean, think about it.
[02:27:16.578 --> 02:27:20.019]  They're members of Skull and Bones, members of Bohemian Grove.
[02:27:20.039 --> 02:27:21.040]  We know they're under the occult.
[02:27:21.798 --> 02:27:23.760]  And they're related to Count Dracula, folks.
[02:27:24.541 --> 02:27:25.622]  Count Dracula.
[02:27:28.025 --> 02:27:30.127]  I mean, MSNBC, folks.
[02:27:31.228 --> 02:27:32.189]  Blood is good.
[02:27:33.511 --> 02:27:35.153]  Blood.
[02:27:36.013 --> 02:27:36.955]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.435 --> 02:27:39.077]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.137 --> 02:27:42.621]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.729 --> 02:27:48.771]  You and your family members getting enough minerals on the daily diet?
[02:27:49.131 --> 02:27:51.633]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[02:27:51.873 --> 02:27:58.957]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[02:27:59.137 --> 02:28:02.439]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[02:28:02.680 --> 02:28:04.701]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[02:28:05.041 --> 02:28:12.866]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[02:28:13.126 --> 02:28:14.406]  Either way, why chance it?
[02:28:14.526 --> 02:28:24.470]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555 and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.

[02:28:45.111 --> 02:28:53.374]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:28:53.614 --> 02:28:57.976]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:28:58.276 --> 02:29:07.179]  The KDF shower filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:29:07.380 --> 02:29:11.001]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:29:11.301 --> 02:29:16.329]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:29:16.629 --> 02:29:23.379]  Hospitals, restaurants and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[02:29:23.860 --> 02:29:24.401]  What about you?

[02:29:47.336 --> 02:29:54.683]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[02:29:55.003 --> 02:29:59.406]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[02:29:59.687 --> 02:30:09.535]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[02:30:10.276 --> 02:30:13.941]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[02:30:14.281 --> 02:30:16.804]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[02:30:17.065 --> 02:30:22.993]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[02:30:23.233 --> 02:30:24.795]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[02:30:25.055 --> 02:30:25.956]  Friends, don't wait.
[02:30:26.016 --> 02:30:29.018]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[02:30:29.179 --> 02:30:30.079]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.

[02:30:52.074 --> 02:30:52.956]  All right, Rochelle.
[02:31:00.340 --> 02:31:02.622]  Mike and Chris and others, your calls are coming up here in a moment.
[02:31:02.642 --> 02:31:04.964]  I'm going to go to calls quickly, so have your questions or comments ready.
[02:31:05.004 --> 02:31:05.724]  We love your calls.
[02:31:05.744 --> 02:31:06.265]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:31:06.305 --> 02:31:11.389]  I want to talk about Rosie O'Donnell and Cher here for a moment.
[02:31:11.409 --> 02:31:13.250]  Then I want to get into the stage capture of Bin Laden.
[02:31:13.290 --> 02:31:14.051]  Is that going to happen?
[02:31:14.391 --> 02:31:18.334]  New developments, a bunch of other police state news with Paul Watson, but we'll do that after some calls.
[02:31:18.795 --> 02:31:22.257]  First off, Paul Watson, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:23.058 --> 02:31:24.839]  I mean, it's just such a great deal.
[02:31:25.660 --> 02:31:28.582]  Tell folks what they get and how they sign up with PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:31:30.521 --> 02:31:36.023]  Well, they get now two weekly reports, so it's not even a weekly report.
[02:31:37.163 --> 02:31:38.803]  It's bi-weekly.
[02:31:39.023 --> 02:31:44.805]  And those weekly reports are getting even more in-depth with guests and analysis of other videos, things like that.
[02:31:45.685 --> 02:31:48.746]  We put on other people's documentary films.
[02:31:48.786 --> 02:31:50.627]  We've got Eric Hoffschmidt's.
[02:31:50.667 --> 02:31:53.368]  We've got 9-11, The Great Illusion by George Humphrey.
[02:31:54.048 --> 02:31:58.029]  All your documentary films, the best audio interviews, special interviews,
[02:31:58.502 --> 02:32:05.965]  Text reports for members and I've just put up a testimonials page so if you want to see what other people think about it.
[02:32:06.566 --> 02:32:15.149]  I was flooded by emails of recommendation when I asked for people to give me feedback on it and so there are dozens of them right there on the subscription page.
[02:32:16.090 --> 02:32:23.253]  Credit card or PayPal, 15 cents if you sign up for a year, 19 cents a day if you sign up for a month.
[02:32:24.292 --> 02:32:27.317]  And it's auto-renewal, so you don't have to do anything about it.
[02:32:27.337 --> 02:32:30.582]  If you want to cancel it at any time, then it's just a couple of clicks away.
[02:32:31.043 --> 02:32:33.688]  And, you know, you spend more than coffee on that in a week.
[02:32:33.808 --> 02:32:37.715]  Most people do so, and it supports that bandwidth cost, so it's a great deal all around.
[02:32:38.516 --> 02:32:46.284]  PrisonPlanet.tv, PrisonPlanet.tv, and of course my new film, American Dictators, is posted in its entirety there.
[02:32:46.985 --> 02:32:50.148]  If you want a hard copy of the new film on VHS or DVD, it's $19.95.
[02:32:50.528 --> 02:32:52.810]  It documents how these elections are staged.
[02:32:52.830 --> 02:33:00.238]  This will be more important after the election to educate people for the future about how they run people who have identical policies, just different rhetoric.
[02:33:00.738 --> 02:33:03.179]  It's a 9-11, gets into the police state.
[02:33:03.199 --> 02:33:03.980]  It's a great new video.
[02:33:04.400 --> 02:33:07.962]  Each additional DVD after $19.95 is $5.95.
[02:33:08.602 --> 02:33:12.945]  So buy four or five copies after you buy one for friends and family to give as gifts.
[02:33:13.325 --> 02:33:16.967]  Instead of giving somebody a tie or a fruitcake they won't eat.
[02:33:17.828 --> 02:33:19.710]  Give them these original videos.
[02:33:19.930 --> 02:33:26.879]  Get 9-11 on the Road to Tyranny, The Masters of Terror, Police State's Retotal Enslavement, Matrix of Evil, my book, Paul Watson's book.
[02:33:27.160 --> 02:33:31.525]  It's all available in hard copy from Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:33:31.545 --> 02:33:32.687]  These are professionally produced.
[02:33:33.107 --> 02:33:36.991]  And you're authorized to make copies of my videos that I've made for non-profit educational purposes.
[02:33:37.371 --> 02:33:48.700]  And I carry, I don't know, like 15 other titles by other great researchers and folks on InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com via the SafeSecure online shopping cart, so be sure and peruse that.
[02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:53.565]  A lot of different specials and deals we're now offering that we've added, so be sure and investigate that.
[02:33:53.845 --> 02:33:55.506]  When you call, be sure and ask about that.
[02:33:55.526 --> 02:33:55.566]  1-888-
[02:33:57.688 --> 02:33:59.149]  253-3139 to call an order.
[02:33:59.169 --> 02:33:59.229]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:33:59.249 --> 02:34:01.831]  Or if you'd like, just write to us at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:34:01.871 --> 02:34:05.293]  I always get complaints I talk too fast, so here it is again.
[02:34:05.313 --> 02:34:07.154]  3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:34:07.194 --> 02:34:07.335]  And...
[02:34:28.155 --> 02:34:33.280]  It's Alex Jones, or 888-253-3139.
[02:34:33.940 --> 02:34:38.044]  Let's go ahead and go to Raquel, or Rochelle in Pennsylvania.
[02:34:38.084 --> 02:34:38.724]  You're on the air.
[02:34:38.784 --> 02:34:39.305]  Go ahead.
[02:34:39.565 --> 02:34:40.206]  Hi, Alex.
[02:34:40.286 --> 02:34:40.966]  How are you doing?
[02:34:41.026 --> 02:34:41.387]  Great.
[02:34:41.927 --> 02:34:42.348]  Oh, great.
[02:34:42.368 --> 02:34:47.292]  I'm your old friend here, and I did you a favor here with WebSpawner.com.
[02:34:47.873 --> 02:34:53.796]  I created a web page here, and I'm trying my best to try to get the word out here.
[02:34:53.816 --> 02:35:00.900]  I think you did yourself, myself, Paul, every free human on the planet a favor by exposing the New World Order.
[02:35:01.101 --> 02:35:05.003]  Oh, my friend, I didn't think you'd mind, so I put you on there first.
[02:35:06.959 --> 02:35:14.443]  I was wondering, once we get all this set up and everything, I'll just check back with you and then I'll post any new news.
[02:35:14.823 --> 02:35:16.304]  You don't have to check back with me, ma'am.
[02:35:16.324 --> 02:35:18.545]  You can put whatever you want about me on there.
[02:35:18.565 --> 02:35:19.645]  You can say I'm good or bad.
[02:35:19.825 --> 02:35:21.446]  It's webspanner.com.
[02:35:21.506 --> 02:35:29.971]  If anybody wants to create a webpage and help spread the word and get people woke up to all of this, then that would be good.
[02:35:30.541 --> 02:35:32.902]  I've called you before, and I just wanted to let you know.
[02:35:33.062 --> 02:35:35.063]  So you have a site on that site?
[02:35:35.323 --> 02:35:35.643]  Yeah.
[02:35:35.823 --> 02:35:36.943]  Yeah, I just created it.
[02:35:37.023 --> 02:35:38.804]  What's the subpage name?
[02:35:39.404 --> 02:35:46.927]  It's just webspanner.com, and then I put on there, it's Newswire, Newsline.
[02:35:48.047 --> 02:35:49.148]  Okay, well, that's great.
[02:35:50.168 --> 02:35:51.189]  What else is on your mind?
[02:35:51.709 --> 02:35:57.511]  I just wanted to say that I think this stuff's getting kind of creepy, and I just...
[02:35:58.135 --> 02:36:12.602]  Wanted to let you know that I'm still listening to you and we watch your stuff and we joined another group and we're trying to wake the people up but they're kind of hard of hearing and they're dull of hearing like the word says and I'm trying to get this done here.
[02:36:12.642 --> 02:36:26.128]  It's under the news line and I have it under the web spawner dot com and I have everything on here the social security number the personal ID tag and the British ID tag and
[02:36:26.852 --> 02:36:30.033]  Anything else on here you want me to put on here, I'll put on here.
[02:36:30.773 --> 02:36:31.373]  You're awesome.
[02:36:31.393 --> 02:36:32.694]  Thank you so much for doing that.
[02:36:33.314 --> 02:36:47.618]  You know, that's a good point she raises there at the end, that whether it's Britain, England, Australia, New Zealand, I call them the extra long group of countries, it's all the same systems going in right now for total control grid, total tracking, Paul.
[02:36:48.619 --> 02:36:51.040]  Same system, even in some cases, same name.
[02:36:51.840 --> 02:36:54.641]  We've got national ID card bills proposed.
[02:36:54.721 --> 02:36:59.423]  It's going to be in the Queen's speech here in a couple of weeks.
[02:36:59.864 --> 02:37:03.745]  And they've been caught faking the numbers for people who supposedly support it.
[02:37:04.245 --> 02:37:05.046]  The government has.
[02:37:05.266 --> 02:37:10.288]  So same policy, same name, same tactics of bringing them in on the back of lies.
[02:37:11.308 --> 02:37:13.469]  Going back to what she was saying about the website,
[02:37:14.204 --> 02:37:19.328]  I mean, that's how I started, you know, with a mailing list of 30 people to start a website.
[02:37:19.348 --> 02:37:21.169]  We just got 30 hits a day eventually.
[02:37:21.229 --> 02:37:24.492]  Now we're here, you know, getting millions of people reading one article.
[02:37:26.153 --> 02:37:34.959]  We could throw a plug in there right now for InfoWarsNetwork.com where you just get a great package if you do want to start your own website.
[02:37:35.360 --> 02:37:36.681]  It's a very simple process.
[02:37:36.741 --> 02:37:41.164]  It's what I did with no knowledge of, you know, computers basically in mid-2001 and here we are today.
[02:37:43.226 --> 02:37:45.390]  It's advisable to do it, and it helps us.
[02:37:46.091 --> 02:37:46.572]  That's right.
[02:37:46.612 --> 02:37:47.875]  Paul had his own website.
[02:37:47.935 --> 02:37:50.119]  And what woke you up to get that website, Paul?
[02:37:52.329 --> 02:38:01.353]  Watching somebody called Alex Jones on a British-made documentary which aired in May of 2001 in Britain.
[02:38:01.613 --> 02:38:05.294]  So, I mean... And then you started your own website, and then you get millions of hits.
[02:38:05.314 --> 02:38:07.715]  You run a couple of my websites that get millions of hits every month.
[02:38:08.355 --> 02:38:10.076]  And again, we're just average people, folks.
[02:38:10.116 --> 02:38:17.078]  I'm just an average guy that knows the truth and studies it and then chronicles their lies and then covers the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:38:17.811 --> 02:38:21.673]  And so I hope people will go to Infowars.net and then click through to the new site.
[02:38:22.074 --> 02:38:28.117]  I hope you will get your own website with us because we want you to spread the word and be successful and we won't censor you.
[02:38:28.797 --> 02:38:31.979]  Let's go ahead now and talk to Michael.
[02:38:32.840 --> 02:38:35.541]  And Michael, you're on the air from Hawaii.
[02:38:35.581 --> 02:38:36.062]  Go ahead.
[02:38:36.342 --> 02:38:37.182]  Aloha, Alex.
[02:38:37.222 --> 02:38:38.703]  Just want to let you know we're spreading the word.
[02:38:38.763 --> 02:38:41.825]  I've got one of my co-workers in the office today that's
[02:38:42.525 --> 02:38:45.806]  First day listening to you on the Internet, so we're riveted.
[02:38:46.086 --> 02:38:47.127]  What's his or her name?
[02:38:47.827 --> 02:38:48.267]  Elizabeth.
[02:38:48.627 --> 02:38:49.347]  Hello, Elizabeth.
[02:38:49.387 --> 02:38:50.488]  Glad you're on board with us.
[02:38:51.528 --> 02:38:53.809]  I know we're destroying your productivity, but that's okay.
[02:38:53.829 --> 02:38:54.469]  I'm just joking.
[02:38:55.970 --> 02:38:59.611]  A couple of things real quick, and Paul can probably comment on it too.
[02:39:00.171 --> 02:39:02.752]  Several weeks ago when you were talking, I had some guests on.
[02:39:02.772 --> 02:39:09.374]  They were talking about stage things as a pretext for having Marshall on and everything, and I was telling a friend on our way home,
[02:39:10.379 --> 02:39:14.342]  And there was another person in the car and they were saying, oh, I really don't believe all that stuff.
[02:39:15.063 --> 02:39:25.511]  And this other friend that I was telling it to who was driving the car called me Friday and she said that Rush Limbaugh was even talking about martial law.
[02:39:26.472 --> 02:39:35.739]  That if Kerry, you know, whatever, regardless what happens after the polls close, Kerry would declare that, you know, he's the winner and start appointing his cabinet members and yada, yada, yada.
[02:39:35.759 --> 02:39:36.760]  And these, you know, a lot of
[02:39:37.523 --> 02:39:39.345]  Well, no, I didn't, but I got emails about it.
[02:39:39.365 --> 02:39:41.068]  When 22 million people hear it, you know, I hear about it.
[02:39:41.088 --> 02:39:44.072]  I listen to Limbaugh occasionally, but this is what I'm trying to say.
[02:39:56.093 --> 02:40:20.142]  Since when did the climate suddenly shift where presidents are appointed by Supreme Courts, where it's like a dictatorship where two different rival groups fight for who's going to be the president, where the process is taken over, they put in electronic voting machines that are even worse than the old systems, and then now, whether it's Michelle Malkin or Michael Savage or Rush Limbaugh, or I just saw a clip in the OutFox video of...
[02:40:21.804 --> 02:40:26.508]  Of O'Reilly talking about arresting people who disagree with the government and putting them in camps.
[02:40:26.928 --> 02:40:30.671]  I mean, I better start watching TV again because I don't watch much yet, but I'm missing this.
[02:40:31.031 --> 02:40:36.315]  I mean, they're just bathing our psyches in this to get us ready for it.
[02:40:36.575 --> 02:40:46.882]  And regardless of whether there's martial law in nine days or six days or eight days or two years from now, they've got it ready, they've got it set up, they've introduced it to us, they've done it.
[02:40:47.743 --> 02:40:48.824]  Paul Watson comments...
[02:40:49.787 --> 02:40:52.108]  Well, yeah, I mean, just look how far we've slipped.
[02:40:52.128 --> 02:40:57.210]  We've got pregnant women being forced to the ground and arrested for talking too loudly on cell phones.
[02:40:57.590 --> 02:41:02.171]  You know, 12-year-old girls being arrested for eating a french fry on a subway station.
[02:41:03.152 --> 02:41:07.553]  So the kind of Brian Shirt mentality has already been drilled into police officers up and down the country.
[02:41:07.573 --> 02:41:12.655]  Women dying who, no criminal record, walk out of a restaurant and are shot in the head by a police officer.
[02:41:13.337 --> 02:41:20.583]  Yeah, and I remember you saying many times that England was always kind of five years ahead of the US in terms of police state and Big Brother.
[02:41:20.643 --> 02:41:26.387]  Big Brother, yeah, with the cameras, but even our police officers are more respectful of individuals than yours now.
[02:41:26.427 --> 02:41:28.369]  It's just gone completely over the top.
[02:41:28.409 --> 02:41:31.151]  And then they kill her, and then they make excuses about it.
[02:41:31.969 --> 02:41:38.692]  Well, yeah, the commissioner comes out and says, yeah, it's all very tragic, but look at all these punks running around doing this, you know, kind of justifying it.
[02:41:38.712 --> 02:41:52.379]  And that's exactly what we were talking about earlier, the attempt to justify it, and then all these neocon talk show hosts glorifying it and applauding the action that they took, shooting a 21-year-old woman in the eye from what amounted to point-blank range.
[02:41:52.879 --> 02:42:00.403]  Yeah, I was on a national talk show this morning, and he was outraged by it, and he was saying that all these people he knows are saying it's wonderful and good.
[02:42:01.064 --> 02:42:01.865]  I mean, he's disgusted.
[02:42:01.925 --> 02:42:02.905]  It's just everywhere.
[02:42:03.285 --> 02:42:04.766]  Mike in Hawaii, anything else?
[02:42:04.966 --> 02:42:05.607]  Nope, that's it.
[02:42:05.627 --> 02:42:06.147]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:42:06.207 --> 02:42:07.028]  Thank you for the call.
[02:42:07.908 --> 02:42:08.829]  Oh, Mike, you still there?
[02:42:09.469 --> 02:42:10.049]  No, he's gone.
[02:42:10.090 --> 02:42:13.011]  I was going to ask if that woke his recalcitrant friend up.
[02:42:13.472 --> 02:42:14.992]  Chris in Kentucky, you're on the air.
[02:42:15.053 --> 02:42:15.673]  Go ahead, Chris.
[02:42:16.754 --> 02:42:17.254]  Hello, Alex.
[02:42:17.514 --> 02:42:17.694]  Hello.
[02:42:17.714 --> 02:42:18.575]  How you doing?
[02:42:19.095 --> 02:42:19.675]  That's good.
[02:42:19.715 --> 02:42:23.037]  Well, I'm against killing women for no reason, so I must be with Al-Qaeda.
[02:42:23.658 --> 02:42:24.318]  You must be.
[02:42:24.538 --> 02:42:28.841]  I must be with Al-Qaeda, because I got your tape, American Dictators, and I viewed it, and I'm making copies.
[02:42:28.861 --> 02:42:29.521]  Good job.
[02:42:30.062 --> 02:42:30.562]  Well done.
[02:42:30.973 --> 02:42:31.333]  Well done.
[02:42:31.393 --> 02:42:33.014]  I'll wake anybody up, left or right.
[02:42:33.394 --> 02:42:35.655]  I'm going to make a copy, and I'm giving one to a congresswoman.
[02:42:36.015 --> 02:42:55.102]  Well, I hope everybody, instead of procrastinating, because we can't wait, instead of giving junk presents this Christmas that are overpriced, buy my videos now, buy a whole bunch of them, buy them at the new super discount of $5.95 with the new film if you buy one, the rest are that much, and give people, say, here's your present, and here it is early.
[02:42:56.209 --> 02:42:56.730]  Absolutely.
[02:42:56.750 --> 02:42:59.011]  And if you don't have the finances, make copies.
[02:42:59.211 --> 02:43:00.632]  That's why I say make copies, yeah.
[02:43:00.993 --> 02:43:07.978]  And I tell you, when you were getting your truck towed out of that scene in there, that guy, you asked about the Bohemian Grove.
[02:43:08.078 --> 02:43:09.799]  Oh, when I went back to Bohemian Grove, yeah.
[02:43:09.839 --> 02:43:13.462]  Yeah, and he said, turn that camera off like a serpent right at you.
[02:43:13.862 --> 02:43:15.123]  Like, he didn't want to talk about it.
[02:43:15.304 --> 02:43:18.866]  Yeah, there locally, the fire department doubles, and you pay them.
[02:43:19.827 --> 02:43:24.871]  The fire department doubles as the tow truck service.
[02:43:25.598 --> 02:43:28.180]  Out there in Northern California, and they were real nice.
[02:43:28.200 --> 02:43:29.420]  They said, hey, what's Bohemian Grove?
[02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:30.261]  Turn that camera off.
[02:43:30.281 --> 02:43:30.801]  Who are you?
[02:43:30.841 --> 02:43:31.382]  What's going on?
[02:43:31.402 --> 02:43:32.902]  Yeah, and they know.
[02:43:33.243 --> 02:43:37.065]  Some of those people admitted they worked there, too, like a couple in that pickup truck.
[02:43:37.705 --> 02:43:39.146]  One of them had worked there at one time.
[02:43:39.386 --> 02:43:40.527]  Yeah, it's an interesting video.
[02:43:40.587 --> 02:43:41.788]  It covers a lot of different bases.
[02:43:42.208 --> 02:43:47.411]  Yeah, please get this, folks, because this is what your leaders go to, so-called conservative Christians out there.
[02:43:48.197 --> 02:43:49.298]  Or left or right.
[02:43:49.358 --> 02:43:56.643]  Well, they're just like their father, the devil, and they're just like their great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather, Dracul.
[02:43:57.244 --> 02:43:58.484]  Absolutely, that's true.
[02:43:58.865 --> 02:44:02.507]  And it's just such, you know, you've got your real white people up, believe me.
[02:44:02.547 --> 02:44:04.189]  I'm still making copies right now.
[02:44:04.209 --> 02:44:05.249]  I'm getting them out to people.
[02:44:05.289 --> 02:44:07.391]  I'm giving out to neighbors, everybody.
[02:44:07.411 --> 02:44:08.352]  But carry your books.
[02:44:08.452 --> 02:44:10.173]  I'm going to give it to them because you need to see this.
[02:44:10.933 --> 02:44:11.593]  The left or right?
[02:44:12.054 --> 02:44:14.816]  What do you think of them killing that poor lady up there in Boston?
[02:44:15.276 --> 02:44:15.996]  Oh, isn't that great?
[02:44:17.317 --> 02:44:18.118]  It's just incredible.
[02:44:18.618 --> 02:44:20.780]  Oh, you know, on that subject, I was watching the news.
[02:44:20.800 --> 02:44:25.283]  They also had clips where the police were just shoving people walking down the street in Boston, too.
[02:44:25.771 --> 02:44:28.493]  Just like, that just goes back to the days of Seattle.
[02:44:28.533 --> 02:44:30.774]  But then the news says, but this is good.
[02:44:30.794 --> 02:44:31.815]  This is so good.
[02:44:31.835 --> 02:44:35.397]  Well, we had a couple bad people, so we've got to show everybody.
[02:44:35.598 --> 02:44:39.600]  See, that's the new Soviet Nazi model where you're all guilty, so you're all bad.
[02:44:39.900 --> 02:44:40.921]  We're bad now.
[02:44:40.981 --> 02:44:41.682]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:42.782 --> 02:44:43.463]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[02:44:44.543 --> 02:44:45.604]  I just wanted to pause for a minute.
[02:44:45.624 --> 02:44:48.686]  Next time we get pulled over, we're going to be bad and just be harassed and killed, too.
[02:44:48.726 --> 02:44:50.447]  That would be good, too, for a traffic citation.
[02:44:50.467 --> 02:44:52.809]  Well, it's like that dog that ran up wagging its tail at the cop.
[02:44:53.470 --> 02:44:54.892]  Yeah, that's what's going to happen.
[02:44:54.912 --> 02:44:57.295]  These people can't tell when a dog's wagging his tail at you?
[02:44:57.896 --> 02:44:58.657]  Oh, you can't tell.
[02:44:58.677 --> 02:45:02.342]  You just got to go ahead and shoot and ask questions later.
[02:45:02.622 --> 02:45:04.485]  We're dealing with a serious enemy.
[02:45:04.785 --> 02:45:05.846]  It is for your safety.
[02:45:06.207 --> 02:45:06.808]  Thanks for the call.
[02:45:07.718 --> 02:45:14.143]  Paul Watson continuing, Lord Bush may be capturing Lord Bin Laden very soon.
[02:45:14.724 --> 02:45:20.968]  Or they may not capture him from his frozen stasis since he died of kidney failure two and a half plus years ago.
[02:45:21.629 --> 02:45:22.910]  But what do you see happening?
[02:45:23.470 --> 02:45:26.933]  Maybe they won't have the stage capture now because we've exposed it?
[02:45:26.993 --> 02:45:27.713]  Or what's going to happen?
[02:45:28.694 --> 02:45:32.597]  Well, I mean, they're guaranteed to have the capture, you know, in the next few months.
[02:45:32.677 --> 02:45:33.518]  I think that's certain.
[02:45:34.098 --> 02:45:36.620]  But, yeah, there's been a few more rumblings.
[02:45:37.702 --> 02:45:57.406]  First of all, we have a Toronto Star article posted today where the journalist talks to this top Afghan security official in Kabul who tells her that it would take them no more than 15 minutes to have him in custody, that they know where he is, they know where he was all along.
[02:45:57.586 --> 02:46:03.347]  And last week, a top general over there said, oh, we know right where he's at, we're just not allowed to get him, he's in Pakistan.
[02:46:04.372 --> 02:46:18.236]  Yeah, and the reasons as to why they're not allowed to get him, as that general said, is because if they caught him, then it wouldn't give them a pretext to remain in Afghanistan and that Pakistan border area.
[02:46:18.536 --> 02:46:22.838]  And our own generals say this, and it's just ignored, like it's no big deal.
[02:46:23.718 --> 02:46:30.460]  Well, yeah, so they want that election, that staged Karzai election, the Unico advisor back in for a second term, they want that out of the way.
[02:46:31.584 --> 02:46:33.586]  Which is just kind of winding up now.
[02:46:34.146 --> 02:46:42.513]  So certainly there's a window of opportunity to go in there and grab him out of his, you know, frozen coffin or whatever.
[02:46:42.593 --> 02:47:00.426]  But also on top of that, there was a mainstream Spanish newspaper which reported that in fact Bin Laden is in the custody of China and that China are using it as a political tool to get trade and weapons concessions from the U.S.,
[02:47:01.016 --> 02:47:12.319]  Which would definitely make sense in light of the fact that all barriers on shipment of nuclear components have just been lifted from American to Chinese companies.
[02:47:12.379 --> 02:47:19.622]  And when Bill Clinton did something, 10% of that people howled, which they should have, our new Secretary General.
[02:47:19.962 --> 02:47:25.243]  The people who were killed, like Ron Brown for blowing the whistle, I mean, that wasn't focused on it.
[02:47:25.283 --> 02:47:30.625]  But then when Bush does it, Bush, by the way, just signed on to the International Criminal Court, it's, oh, so conservative!
[02:47:31.437 --> 02:47:36.280]  Yeah, they've just removed all the barriers on shipping these new components to China.
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:40.903]  So again, as China threatens to invade... But China isn't the threat.
[02:47:41.243 --> 02:47:42.884]  China isn't the threat threatening to nuke us.
[02:47:43.245 --> 02:47:44.245]  It's little old ladies.
[02:47:44.285 --> 02:47:45.466]  We've got to have checkpoints.
[02:47:45.826 --> 02:47:47.547]  It's in the new National ID Card Bill.
[02:47:48.008 --> 02:47:57.754]  We've got... The government's got to kill a few young girls and got to run around in black ski masks and got to, you know, request flamethrowers now, as you just heard from the reporter we had on last hour.
[02:47:59.315 --> 02:48:02.376]  Did you hear about how the Fort Worth requested a flamethrower?
[02:48:03.016 --> 02:48:04.697]  No, I didn't catch that one.
[02:48:04.717 --> 02:48:06.558]  For crowd control, yeah.
[02:48:06.778 --> 02:48:07.639]  Folks, I'm not joking.
[02:48:09.579 --> 02:48:10.620]  That's the thing about all this.
[02:48:10.680 --> 02:48:11.660]  It's getting too crazy.
[02:48:12.881 --> 02:48:13.301]  Well, it is.
[02:48:13.321 --> 02:48:14.102]  It's in your face.
[02:48:14.202 --> 02:48:15.682]  But, you know, why is it in your face?
[02:48:15.722 --> 02:48:18.684]  They want to train people to accept it and normalize it.
[02:48:18.724 --> 02:48:21.145]  Basically, that's what they do with all these kind of programs.
[02:48:23.351 --> 02:48:25.312]  We'll hit a few final news articles when we get back.
[02:48:25.332 --> 02:48:26.192]  In fact, more than a few.
[02:48:26.212 --> 02:48:27.573]  There's a whole plethora of them.
[02:48:27.593 --> 02:48:29.014]  We'll just rocket through them.
[02:48:29.734 --> 02:48:31.515]  On the other side, so please stay with us.
[02:48:31.615 --> 02:48:35.757]  I'm Alex Jones, joined by the webmaster for PrisonPlanet.tv, Paul Watson.
[02:48:36.237 --> 02:48:39.238]  Check out the redesigned InfoWars.net.
[02:48:39.638 --> 02:48:43.500]  Today, ladies and gentlemen, we're only growing in our fight against the globalists.
[02:48:45.834 --> 02:48:47.335]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:48:47.536 --> 02:48:50.639]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:48:50.759 --> 02:48:54.663]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:48:54.703 --> 02:48:58.947]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:48:59.307 --> 02:49:03.071]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:49:03.211 --> 02:49:05.053]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:49:05.073 --> 02:49:05.273]  Right.
[02:49:08.276 --> 02:49:13.281]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[02:49:13.421 --> 02:49:16.484]  You see them here with their hands cuffed behind their backs.
[02:49:16.645 --> 02:49:19.507]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:49:20.008 --> 02:49:26.114]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:49:26.634 --> 02:49:28.115]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139
[02:49:45.808 --> 02:49:48.809]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:49:49.149 --> 02:49:57.952]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:49:58.292 --> 02:50:02.974]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:50:03.434 --> 02:50:10.162]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:50:10.563 --> 02:50:22.357]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:50:22.817 --> 02:50:27.279]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:50:27.439 --> 02:50:30.320]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:30.380 --> 02:50:32.300]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:50:32.320 --> 02:50:32.960]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[02:50:33.041 --> 02:50:34.501]  Or order on the web at berkeywater.com.
[02:50:34.521 --> 02:50:35.721]  Not yet available in Iowa.

[02:51:53.278 --> 02:52:02.262]  Rosie O'Donnell, who can't ever get more than about 100 people out to one of her gun-grabbing conferences, had a pro-carry rally, and it says two dozen people showed up.
[02:52:03.963 --> 02:52:06.544]  And then Cher had about 200 people show up.
[02:52:06.564 --> 02:52:08.125]  It just shows this whole left-right thing.
[02:52:08.165 --> 02:52:10.786]  I mean, I hate her so much it makes me like Bush.
[02:52:10.806 --> 02:52:13.027]  I mean, that's how it works on you.
[02:52:13.067 --> 02:52:14.628]  You think, oh, look at all these evil liberals.
[02:52:14.688 --> 02:52:15.688]  Man, Bush must be good.
[02:52:15.728 --> 02:52:17.349]  No, he's carrying out their agenda.
[02:52:17.369 --> 02:52:18.610]  They're just too dumb to know.
[02:52:19.550 --> 02:52:20.571]  That it's a staged event.
[02:52:20.611 --> 02:52:25.134]  Also, huge cache of explosives vanished from the site in Iraq.
[02:52:25.154 --> 02:52:34.820]  380 tons of powerful conventional explosives used to demolish buildings, make missile warheads, and detonate nuclear weapons are missing from one of Iraq's most secretive former military installations.
[02:52:35.180 --> 02:52:40.663]  They didn't come up missing under Saddam, though, but under American control, and now they think Al-CIA has them.
[02:52:41.124 --> 02:52:42.344]  Al-CIA has them.
[02:52:42.384 --> 02:52:43.065]  Paul comments...
[02:52:44.082 --> 02:52:49.952]  Well, yeah, I've already heard neocons referring to them as WMD, as they do with anything like this.
[02:52:50.093 --> 02:52:52.237]  They found WMD's plastic explosive!
[02:52:53.320 --> 02:53:15.579]  Yeah, there was another report about a month ago about chemical weapons, and if you read into the body of the article, it was on World Neocon Daily, it actually admitted that this case was similar to past cases where it proved that they were completely spent weapons, like in the case where those UN inspectors were sticking their noses into the shells and they were still calling them weapons of mass destruction.
[02:53:16.339 --> 02:53:25.305]  Yeah, let me tell you, if you've got a real Sarin or VX thing, man, you're in a special containment building, humans don't get near it, only robots, you know, robotic arms mess with it.
[02:53:25.325 --> 02:53:27.227]  I mean, one gram of it and you're dead.
[02:53:27.967 --> 02:53:30.029]  Teacher jailed after brawl with parent.
[02:53:30.389 --> 02:53:32.931]  Why is this AP article important out of Macon, Georgia?
[02:53:33.291 --> 02:53:38.975]  Because the article admits that the mother came and the teacher had thrown the girl's backpack in the trash.
[02:53:39.515 --> 02:53:41.057]  Well, no, it underlines the fact that
[02:53:56.306 --> 02:53:58.948]  Government is telling us that self-defense is wrong.
[02:53:59.249 --> 02:54:04.773]  Like in England, where it's basically a crime to fight back against the burglar who's breaking into your house.
[02:54:04.833 --> 02:54:07.175]  But it says she didn't even fight back, though, according to the witnesses.
[02:54:07.235 --> 02:54:09.037]  They just beat her, but still she's evil.
[02:54:09.978 --> 02:54:11.079]  Here's another one out of Reuters.
[02:54:11.779 --> 02:54:15.722]  You've got your first avowed Satanist, and your Navy says this is wonderful.
[02:54:15.863 --> 02:54:17.844]  They're on the ship, one of your officers.
[02:54:18.525 --> 02:54:24.570]  We've got Colonel Aquino, the head of psychological warfare, for decades was the head of the Church of Set.
[02:54:25.966 --> 02:54:27.407]  Well, yeah, it's been going on for years.
[02:54:27.447 --> 02:54:28.728]  Again, they're just normalising it.
[02:54:28.828 --> 02:54:44.859]  And, you know, this week there'll be numerous school fates and parties centred around this occult, ritualistic Halloween, and yet morning prayer is now scoffed at in this country as something extreme, right-wing and, you know...
[02:54:45.419 --> 02:54:54.161]  And by the way, the Associated Press and Encyclopedia admit it is Samhain, and it's human sacrifice night, and that's what it is, and just a fact.
[02:54:54.361 --> 02:54:55.801]  But you can celebrate that, don't worry.
[02:54:56.721 --> 02:54:58.381]  This is out of AFP.
[02:54:58.842 --> 02:55:05.883]  Bush, in a thing that aired today on Fox, said that, well, the terrorists are trying to figure out how to attack us to disrupt, but he doesn't know if they will.
[02:55:06.383 --> 02:55:07.963]  So they keep saying they're going to attack us.
[02:55:08.023 --> 02:55:09.003]  No, I never said that.
[02:55:09.323 --> 02:55:10.824]  Applying and removing the pressure.
[02:55:10.984 --> 02:55:12.084]  Talk about that psychology.
[02:55:12.873 --> 02:55:14.453]  Well, yeah, again, it's doublespeak.
[02:55:14.893 --> 02:55:18.934]  It's like Bush will say he's an optimist and that he's protected America.
[02:55:19.314 --> 02:55:26.476]  Then on the same day, as happened last week, you'll get Dick Cheney coming out and saying that a city's about to get nuked.
[02:55:27.016 --> 02:55:31.597]  And they'll also say the war on terror can't be won, but it can be won and it will be won.
[02:55:32.977 --> 02:55:34.217]  But then it'll never end, though, Paul.
[02:55:35.577 --> 02:55:36.257]  Well, exactly.
[02:55:36.638 --> 02:55:39.018]  Social Security recipients urged to go direct...
[02:55:39.620 --> 02:55:40.921]  Uncle Sam wants you to go direct.
[02:55:40.981 --> 02:55:42.743]  No, it isn't an appeal for the military recruits.
[02:55:43.063 --> 02:55:46.687]  It's a new campaign by government to encourage people who receive social security.
[02:55:46.887 --> 02:55:48.849]  They're going to force everybody onto this, Paul.
[02:55:49.950 --> 02:55:59.079]  Well, yeah, now on the draft subject, New York Times last week saying that this forced draft of medical workers is in the works and will be introduced.
[02:55:59.600 --> 02:56:02.082]  And military officers are suing who've been in 10, 20 years.
[02:56:03.567 --> 02:56:06.789]  They're saying, I'm supposed to be out now, but they won't let me for the last year.
[02:56:07.129 --> 02:56:08.570]  But that's not a draft, is it, Paul?
[02:56:09.010 --> 02:56:09.670]  Well, no.
[02:56:09.810 --> 02:56:11.731]  Both candidates support attacking Iran.
[02:56:12.252 --> 02:56:15.753]  We've been told we'll need 600,000 troops if we go into North Korea.
[02:56:15.773 --> 02:56:17.914]  So how else are they going to do that but without a draft?
[02:56:18.535 --> 02:56:19.815]  And that could happen any day now.
[02:56:19.915 --> 02:56:21.496]  Israel says they may attack any day.
[02:56:21.576 --> 02:56:22.877]  Iran's now threatening people.
[02:56:23.637 --> 02:56:24.738]  World War III, folks.
[02:56:25.358 --> 02:56:28.140]  Back tonight, 9 to midnight Central, on the shortwave at 3210.
[02:56:28.840 --> 02:56:30.181]  And back tomorrow, 11 to 2.
[02:56:30.261 --> 02:56:31.161]  Start all the callers.
[02:56:31.181 --> 02:56:32.102]  We'll be back tomorrow.
[02:56:32.122 --> 02:56:32.502]  God bless.
[02:56:35.897 --> 02:56:36.495]  Hello, folks.
