[00:00:05.986 --> 00:00:06.627]  Big Brother.
[00:00:07.288 --> 00:00:08.349]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:10.172]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:11.634]  You want answers?
[00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:13.176]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.583]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:18.124 --> 00:00:22.267]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.448 --> 00:00:29.554]  All right, my friends.
[00:00:29.634 --> 00:00:35.359]  Thanks for joining us on this live Tuesday edition of the Global Transmission Against Tyranny.
[00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.562]  Hope you've had a good Memorial Day.
[00:00:40.103 --> 00:00:44.924]  We'll be talking about Bush's plans to slash the benefits for the troops as soon as he's re-elected.
[00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:47.565]  Of course, Lord Kerry would do the same thing.
[00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:50.866]  Their actions are identical, but their rhetoric is simply different.
[00:00:51.746 --> 00:00:53.306]  I've been on a brief hiatus.
[00:00:54.047 --> 00:00:56.627]  I really never take off, but I have taken off a few days.
[00:00:56.687 --> 00:01:00.468]  And it's good to be back, and the news has really piled up.
[00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:03.889]  So this is going to be a big show for you today.
[00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:06.310]  I hope that you will stay with us.
[00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:11.244]  On this June 1st, 2004 edition.
[00:01:12.444 --> 00:01:22.191]  Coming up in about 30 minutes, we've got the ACLU legal director in Georgia, Jerry Weber, coming on the show.
[00:01:23.112 --> 00:01:27.295]  And I have the Associated Press here in front of me, as well as other articles.
[00:01:27.375 --> 00:01:33.179]  It says, "...state of emergency allows Brunswick police to halt G8 protesters."
[00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:40.484]  And it is a preemptive state of emergency, and dissent is illegal.
[00:01:41.504 --> 00:01:43.425]  That's called martial law.
[00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:45.045]  Protesting is bad.
[00:01:45.486 --> 00:01:47.766]  Preemptively, we're not going to let you do it.
[00:01:48.947 --> 00:01:53.969]  And now it's come out that they've been given orders to shoot, to kill protesters.
[00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:57.690]  So we'll be discussing that coming up.
[00:01:57.731 --> 00:01:58.951]  This is your new freedom.
[00:02:00.292 --> 00:02:03.653]  Same kind of freedom that's being brought to Iraq right now.
[00:02:04.665 --> 00:02:06.126]  So we'll be covering that.
[00:02:06.146 --> 00:02:08.909]  Of course, Paul Watson joins us once a week at least.
[00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:13.252]  Our webmaster and editor of my website is PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:02:13.953 --> 00:02:15.854]  And, of course, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:02:15.874 --> 00:02:18.296]  We also have InfoWars.com being updated right now.
[00:02:19.597 --> 00:02:22.500]  But Paul will be joining us in the second hour.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.542]  We'll also have wide open telephones.
[00:02:27.104 --> 00:02:33.469]  But as I said, in about 28 minutes we'll be getting into State of Emergency Shoot to Kill Orders at G8 in Georgia.
[00:02:34.435 --> 00:02:38.619]  Also, Ashcroft warns of attack, some question threat, and it's timing.
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.323]  Well, it's admitted that they put out fake terror alerts to create fear.
[00:02:44.024 --> 00:02:49.289]  Kerry, joining with his buddies, nuclear terrorism is the gravest threat to the U.S.
[00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:56.035]  Gary Hart, CFR member, chief fearmonger, tells Fox News a warning or a threat.
[00:02:56.095 --> 00:02:59.138]  Hart says Heartland is the target.
[00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:06.718]  Because, quote, we haven't been worried about the Heartland, so the terrorists are sure to hit us there to get the maximum result, and we know who the terrorists are.
[00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.622]  Mr. Hart, what did you say right after the 9-11 attack?
[00:03:11.385 --> 00:03:12.946]  We need to use this disaster.
[00:03:13.546 --> 00:03:16.747]  Forget what President Bush's father called for, a new world order.
[00:03:16.767 --> 00:03:17.908]  We need to use this crisis.
[00:03:18.548 --> 00:03:26.072]  Oil prices soar after deadly Saudi attack, and even CNN is talking about it being a government conspiracy.
[00:03:26.872 --> 00:03:30.834]  Saudi security forces agreed to let al-Qaeda killers escape.
[00:03:31.234 --> 00:03:32.514]  This is the one in Telegraph.
[00:03:32.615 --> 00:03:37.957]  Bremer accused of interfering with the new installment of the new puppet government in Iraq.
[00:03:38.577 --> 00:03:41.620]  Iraqi with MI6 links is the new Prime Minister of Iraq.
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:45.683]  And again, what I mentioned, CNN says Saudi attack was a conspiracy.
[00:03:46.183 --> 00:03:48.926]  Bush plans to slash veterans' benefits.
[00:03:49.926 --> 00:03:53.209]  Car bomb rips through Kurdish party HQ in Baghdad.
[00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:55.731]  Iraqi women raped at Abu Ghraib.
[00:03:55.791 --> 00:03:57.672]  This is supposedly new information.
[00:03:58.333 --> 00:04:04.998]  A month ago, a month plus, the General Antonio Tagumba report said raping women.
[00:04:05.038 --> 00:04:05.739]  It's admitted.
[00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:07.520]  We're good to go.
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:07.720]  I think?
[00:04:36.044 --> 00:04:36.944]  Want to get into that.
[00:04:37.665 --> 00:04:39.766]  Cops count on pizza tattletales.
[00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:51.391]  Not just when you order a pizza, but the pizza man himself, the secret agent of the New World Order, tasering nine-year-old children, slamming down small children that try to hug police.
[00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:54.653]  Just an absolute buffer of key news.
[00:04:55.013 --> 00:04:56.734]  You don't want to miss this transmission.
[00:04:56.774 --> 00:04:57.314]  Stay with us.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:02.940]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.221]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:10.242]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:05:10.302 --> 00:05:14.542]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State to the Takeover.
[00:05:14.882 --> 00:05:18.643]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:05:18.783 --> 00:05:20.643]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:05:20.783 --> 00:05:24.104]  Riot police attacked people on the street indiscriminately.
[00:05:24.144 --> 00:05:28.865]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:05:29.005 --> 00:05:30.325]  You see them here with their hands
[00:05:30.965 --> 00:05:32.046]  Cup behind their backs.
[00:05:32.226 --> 00:05:35.108]  They are being let into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:05:35.568 --> 00:05:41.712]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:05:42.232 --> 00:05:46.034]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[00:05:46.434 --> 00:05:47.795]  Order your video today.
[00:05:48.136 --> 00:05:49.196]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[00:05:49.216 --> 00:05:51.217]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139.

[00:06:00.643 --> 00:06:02.245]  Hello folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:02.605 --> 00:06:08.351]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:06:08.611 --> 00:06:13.737]  The Berkey light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:14.077 --> 00:06:23.367]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, trihalomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:06:23.707 --> 00:06:28.649]  Its rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.992]  The lights can run all night on a single charge, and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:06:33.192 --> 00:06:37.994]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:06:38.334 --> 00:06:44.237]  The Berkey Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:06:44.577 --> 00:06:53.600]  Get the Berkey Light, the standard of excellence for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.981]  That's toll free at 888-803-4438.
[00:06:57.881 --> 00:06:58.961]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:07:00.562 --> 00:07:02.262]  Is the air you breathe killing you?
[00:07:02.842 --> 00:07:03.182]  What?
[00:07:03.242 --> 00:07:09.384]  The Environmental Protection Agency studies state that indoor air is up to 70 times more polluted than outdoor city air.
[00:07:09.724 --> 00:07:11.545]  Even Oprah addressed this concern on her show.
[00:07:11.945 --> 00:07:12.405]  Heard enough?
[00:07:13.007 --> 00:07:13.648]  Sure have.
[00:07:13.888 --> 00:07:15.430]  How can I purify my air?
[00:07:15.671 --> 00:07:15.931]  Easy.
[00:07:16.292 --> 00:07:18.875]  Start with a visit to PurifyMyAir.com.
[00:07:19.236 --> 00:07:20.718]  Order the Home Air Purifier.
[00:07:21.118 --> 00:07:21.719]  Lab tested.

[00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.170]  Wow!

[00:07:53.713 --> 00:08:00.239]  I'm going to call 1-888-88-MY-AIR or I'm going to purifymyair.com.
[00:08:02.641 --> 00:08:08.666]  From his Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:08:09.286 --> 00:08:12.269]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:15.584 --> 00:08:20.145]  Alright my friends, it is June 1st already on this Tuesday edition.
[00:08:20.365 --> 00:08:22.566]  Thank you so much again for joining us.
[00:08:23.286 --> 00:08:24.787]  We're going to have wide open telephones.
[00:08:24.827 --> 00:08:26.447]  We have two guests coming up as well.
[00:08:26.507 --> 00:08:34.070]  The toll free number to join us live on air, coast to coast and globally on shortwave the internet and our AM and FM affiliates is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:34.490]  That's 1-800-259-9231.
[00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.490]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[00:08:47.575 --> 00:09:04.707]  So much to cover today, so I'm going to launch straight into the news, and then we've got a guest coming up, because they've basically declared martial law in large sections of Georgia ahead of the G8 Summit coming up in a little over a week from now, the 8th through the 10th.
[00:09:07.552 --> 00:09:30.243]  But I was just thinking this weekend, kind of getting outside the box, looking at it from the outside, and I just thought about the fact that the government and the League of Women Voters and all these states are fighting tooth and nail to ensure that all these new federally controlled electronic voting machines that are going in, riddled with fraud across the country,
[00:09:30.928 --> 00:09:38.753]  How they're telling us that we're bad, that we're crazy, that we're weird, because we want there to be a receipt, a record of that vote.
[00:09:40.093 --> 00:09:41.174]  Just trust us!
[00:09:42.675 --> 00:09:46.117]  You know, we could easily have a record, but we're not going to, so shut up!
[00:09:48.092 --> 00:09:49.312]  Just think about that.
[00:09:49.373 --> 00:09:53.474]  Just think about how they have free speech zones now.
[00:09:53.514 --> 00:10:11.261]  If you want to protest the state or federal government and they say, oh, the media's not allowed to talk to you and you've got to be a mile, two miles away in a warehouse, and if you leave it, we'll arrest you, and then the police routinely go ahead and go to the warehouse or the park and fire rubber bullets at people and beat up federal judges and AP reporters.
[00:10:11.301 --> 00:10:12.281]  I mean, this has been happening.
[00:10:14.096 --> 00:10:15.437]  Is this freedom?
[00:10:15.457 --> 00:10:32.705]  And there's reports coast to coast of school teachers that criticize the government being summarily fired and having weird military parades at public schools and the art teachers have anti-war posters ripped down that the students did from the inside of their classes and are fired.
[00:10:34.126 --> 00:10:36.507]  I mean, this isn't America, people.
[00:10:39.208 --> 00:10:40.449]  This isn't freedom.
[00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:47.223]  They're blocking what films can be edited and what books can be published in America now.
[00:10:47.263 --> 00:10:47.984]  Did you know that?
[00:10:48.784 --> 00:10:53.848]  Claiming that, well, if it's a foreign work, it might be involved with aiding the enemy, so we can't have that.
[00:10:54.148 --> 00:10:58.111]  I mean, we're on the edge of plunging even deeper into the abyss.
[00:10:58.371 --> 00:11:03.455]  We're quite far down the hole, the tubes, the pit right now.
[00:11:07.611 --> 00:11:10.033]  And then I see articles like this.
[00:11:10.393 --> 00:11:14.336]  State of emergency allows Brunswick police to halt G8 protesters.
[00:11:14.877 --> 00:11:16.658]  This is out of the Associated Press.
[00:11:17.399 --> 00:11:22.323]  Governor's order covers six counties, including Glynn, Camden, and Chatham.
[00:11:23.038 --> 00:11:35.344]  A new city law in Brunswick gives police the power to halt protests during G8 Summit now that the governor has declared a preemptive state of emergency, it's called martial law, boys and girls, in coastal Georgia through June 20th.
[00:11:35.564 --> 00:11:44.928]  You try to protest in China for the security of the state, they will open fire on you, they will run over you with tanks, and now we're becoming just like China with Tiananmen Square, boys and girls.
[00:11:46.212 --> 00:11:55.603]  Activists said the change allows authorities to squelch lawful dissent without reason when President Bush meets with world leaders June 8th through 10th at a nearby Sea Island.
[00:11:55.623 --> 00:12:00.869]  Brunswick's Mayor and Governor Sonny Perdue's top lawyer denied any such intent.
[00:12:00.889 --> 00:12:03.733]  When I've got the legislation here in front of me, it is martial law.
[00:12:04.791 --> 00:12:16.547]  Purdue signed an order May 7th declaring a state of emergency in six coastal counties beginning Monday, citing potential danger from unlawful assemblies, threats of violence, and otherwise.
[00:12:16.587 --> 00:12:18.890]  So, unlawful assemblages.
[00:12:19.752 --> 00:12:20.653]  That's what it's a word.
[00:12:20.993 --> 00:12:22.155]  Assemblages, excuse me.
[00:12:23.092 --> 00:12:23.713]  Unlawful!
[00:12:24.013 --> 00:12:34.619]  I thought the First Amendment said Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or the press or the right to assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances.
[00:12:34.719 --> 00:12:36.581]  But you know that First Amendment.
[00:12:36.621 --> 00:12:37.121]  It's bad.
[00:12:38.385 --> 00:12:41.206]  The governor's order places no limitations on demonstrations.
[00:12:41.266 --> 00:12:54.209]  However, the Brunswick City Council amended its laws last week to give police authority to terminate protests if a state of emergency or disorder is lawfully declared, which was just done, so they've now told the protesters you can't protest in these six counties.
[00:12:54.869 --> 00:13:03.771]  Brunswick is the nearest mainland city to Sea Island, 80 miles south of Savannah, Georgia, where Lord Bush and the other lords of the G-8 will meet.
[00:13:04.392 --> 00:13:11.217]  Protest groups have been trying for months to get a permit to demonstrate the city when the summit arrives in two weeks, and that's been denied.
[00:13:12.799 --> 00:13:15.641]  Now, look, you don't need a permit, and the courts have all said this.
[00:13:16.481 --> 00:13:22.146]  But they started out decades ago, well, if you want police protection or to block off the street, you have to get a permit.
[00:13:22.546 --> 00:13:26.049]  And then, again, that becomes the common practice, and they say, oh, you can't protest.
[00:13:27.162 --> 00:13:33.626]  It is rare for governors to preemptively declare states of emergency, normally reserved for disasters such as hurricanes or tornadoes.
[00:13:33.666 --> 00:13:38.869]  However, Governor Zell Miller issued a similar order in the 1996 games in Atlanta.
[00:13:41.831 --> 00:13:43.252]  And then we have this article here.
[00:13:44.705 --> 00:13:49.306]  Shoot to kill orders at G8 in Georgia on May 2050, 2004.
[00:13:49.386 --> 00:13:59.309]  Pacifica News reported on their daily news broadcast about the current orders being given to the police that will be responding to the G8 conference in Georgia this year.
[00:13:59.349 --> 00:14:05.430]  According to the broadcast, the governor of Georgia was going through the motions of declaring a state of emergency during the G8 protest.
[00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.471]  This is a so-called state of emergency.
[00:14:07.491 --> 00:14:09.411]  It would allow the police and the entire state to protest.
[00:14:10.026 --> 00:14:13.249]  We have the Sydney Morning Herald article from years ago where they said the same thing, but...
[00:14:38.949 --> 00:14:39.629]  They didn't do it.
[00:14:39.750 --> 00:14:41.530]  It's all just to intimidate people.
[00:14:41.911 --> 00:14:49.734]  This order will only go into effect if the governor is capable of issuing a state of emergency, but you did hear me right, shoot to kill.
[00:14:49.874 --> 00:14:53.996]  And now they've issued the order a day after this article came out.
[00:14:55.257 --> 00:15:00.039]  Meanwhile, the New York Times reported something that's documented fact, but they've whitewashed it.
[00:15:00.923 --> 00:15:05.326]  As Ashcroft warns of attacks, some question threat and its timing.
[00:15:05.506 --> 00:15:19.413]  The Bush administration said Wednesday that it had credible intelligence suggesting that Al-Qaeda is planning to attack the United States in the next several months, a period in which events like an international summit meeting and two political conventions could offer tempting targets.
[00:15:20.069 --> 00:15:34.899]  Attorney General John Ashcroft said at a news conference that the intelligence reports and public statements by people associated with Al-CIA suggested that the terrorist group was almost ready to attack the United States and harbored a specific intention to hit the United States hard.
[00:15:34.919 --> 00:15:40.123]  Of course, about a week and a half ago, they told the Associated Press as well as the U.S.
[00:15:40.163 --> 00:15:42.244]  News & World Report that we will be hit.
[00:15:42.284 --> 00:15:43.205]  It is going to happen.
[00:15:43.806 --> 00:15:52.382]  And they've done their own focus group poll showing this will help them in the election, so you can basically be assured of it, unfortunately, unless we expose who's behind this terror.
[00:15:53.010 --> 00:16:22.810]  But some intelligence officials, terrorism experts, and to some extent even Mr. Ashcroft's own FBI director, Robert S. Mueller, offered a more temperate assessment, saying, for the next few weeks, we have reason to believe that there is a heightened threat to the United States' interests around the world, and some opponents of Mr. Bush, including police and firefighter union leaders, aligned with Senator John Kerry, the expected Democratic presidential candidate, said the timing of the announcement appeared intended in part to distract attention from Mr. Bush's sagging poll numbers and problems in Iraq.
[00:16:23.731 --> 00:16:29.596]  There's no real intelligence, and a lot of this has been out there already, said one administration official who spoke in condition of anonymity.
[00:16:29.856 --> 00:16:35.060]  There really is no significant change that would require us to change the alert level of the country.
[00:16:36.241 --> 00:16:41.866]  Well, for two years, we have a whole subsection on PrisonPlanet.com, fake terror alerts.
[00:16:43.287 --> 00:16:46.410]  FBI, CIA agents, Associated Press, Reuters.
[00:16:47.341 --> 00:16:56.570]  Capitol Hill Blue, World Net Daily, admitting that the White House has ordered fake terror alerts to be issued to, quote, create hysteria and fear.
[00:16:57.822 --> 00:17:01.325]  Now, under the Patriot Act, that is a very serious crime.
[00:17:01.365 --> 00:17:07.749]  I think it's a crime, before we had the Patriot Act, a yelling fire in a theater, a bomb scare.
[00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:11.812]  This is a national bomb scare, and they've been caught.
[00:17:11.973 --> 00:17:12.693]  It's admitted.
[00:17:13.193 --> 00:17:22.320]  Remember during last Christmas, they said, oh, the intelligence was faulty, we're sorry, but the orange alert's going to continue throughout the new year, and it went to, what, January 4th?
[00:17:24.021 --> 00:17:26.103]  Turned into a two-and-a-half-week terror alert.
[00:17:27.096 --> 00:17:30.278]  And they still have the helicopters and the welded manhole covers.
[00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:37.243]  They've been all over television the last week saying, look for women that look like they're pregnant, people wearing baggy clothes, people that smell of chemicals.
[00:17:37.303 --> 00:17:38.284]  Report, everyone.
[00:17:38.584 --> 00:17:40.085]  Report, report, report.
[00:17:41.897 --> 00:17:51.344]  And then as they create these tattletale squads of cable men and pizza delivery men and women, there's no real terrorists, so they say, well, just look for drugs and guns.
[00:17:51.664 --> 00:17:53.245]  I have a whole stack of that today.
[00:17:53.265 --> 00:18:02.051]  Homeland Security now says they're in the anti-crime business, because crime is terror, because criminals fund terrorists, drugs fund terrorists.
[00:18:02.452 --> 00:18:07.295]  So we've got, it's all terror now, every misdemeanor, every suspicion of a misdemeanor.
[00:18:09.412 --> 00:18:12.293]  And Kerry's joining in on the fun, the fear-mongering.
[00:18:12.333 --> 00:18:15.075]  Kerry, nuclear terrorism is the gravest threat to U.S.
[00:18:15.235 --> 00:18:15.635]  Reuters.
[00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:26.360]  Nuclear terrorism is the gravest threat that the United States faces, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry said, as he offered a plan to secure atomic arsenals and materials around the world.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:29.942]  The enemy is different and we must think and act anew, Kerry said.
[00:18:31.292 --> 00:18:41.912]  As excerpts and remarks prepared for delivery in West Palm Beach, Florida, we have to do everything we can to stop a nuclear weapon from reaching our shore, and that mission begins far away.
[00:18:43.578 --> 00:18:45.399]  And then a really scary statement.
[00:18:45.459 --> 00:18:53.482]  Remember, it was Gary Hart and Warren Rudman of the CFR fear-mongering commission that got up on TV months before 9-11 and said, We're about to be hit.
[00:18:53.522 --> 00:18:54.262]  It's going to happen.
[00:18:54.282 --> 00:18:55.522]  Give up all your rights when it happens.
[00:18:55.542 --> 00:18:56.503]  Big buildings are in trouble.
[00:18:56.723 --> 00:18:58.283]  Started laughing on hardball.
[00:18:58.343 --> 00:18:59.424]  I saw that and knew.
[00:18:59.924 --> 00:19:01.564]  Went on air and said, Call the White House.
[00:19:01.585 --> 00:19:03.645]  Tell them don't use Bin Laden to attack New York.
[00:19:04.466 --> 00:19:06.466]  But a warning or a threat?
[00:19:06.766 --> 00:19:08.347]  Hart says Heartland is the target.
[00:19:08.945 --> 00:19:17.611]  Former Colorado Senator Gary Hart is alarmed at hearing this week's warnings of possible summer terror attacks by Al-Qaeda operatives here in the United States.
[00:19:17.651 --> 00:19:21.814]  In a recent plea, the Democrat urged Denver city leaders to wake up.
[00:19:21.914 --> 00:19:26.918]  Denver isn't ready to respond to a catastrophe, and neither are large cities west of the Mississippi.
[00:19:27.538 --> 00:19:30.961]  He said about a year ago that Denver, Cleveland, and Dallas will be hit.
[00:19:32.268 --> 00:19:35.310]  On a recent visit to New York University, Hart, who co-chaired both the U.S.
[00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:45.115]  Commission on National Security, 21st Century, and the Council on Foreign Relations Task Force on Homeland Security, told Fox News that America in the heartland needs a serious wake-up call.
[00:19:45.215 --> 00:19:51.198]  I have focused on my own region because I think people out there believe terrorism is a New York problem, not an American problem, Hart said.
[00:19:51.518 --> 00:19:56.921]  The Mississippi is not any kind of protection for Denver, Colorado, or Omaha, Nebraska, or anyone else.
[00:19:57.362 --> 00:19:59.063]  Yes, we know, Mr. Hart, we're not safe.
[00:19:59.103 --> 00:19:59.723]  We understand that.
[00:20:01.937 --> 00:20:09.819]  Skyrocketing oil prices, the economy on the brink, the plunging dollar, terrorism, the government spending $1.80 for every dollar it collects.
[00:20:10.159 --> 00:20:15.421]  Never in the history of our country have we faced so many threats to our freedoms, rights, and individual security.
[00:20:15.601 --> 00:20:18.222]  How long can we continue without a fracture occurring?
[00:20:18.342 --> 00:20:23.443]  With the events that recently rocked the elections in Spain, what will happen as we get closer to our own elections?
[00:20:23.963 --> 00:20:26.444]  Now is the time to begin preparing for such threats.

[00:21:01.391 --> 00:21:06.092]  Forecasting the weather with any amount of accuracy takes a meteorologist with years of schooling and experience.
[00:21:06.332 --> 00:21:09.773]  Forecasting what the financial markets will be doing in the future takes the same thing.
[00:21:09.973 --> 00:21:12.454]  No, not a meteorologist, a lot of schooling and experience.
[00:21:12.694 --> 00:21:21.296]  Although most people check the weather forecast before venturing outside to avoid a good soaking, it's amazing how few people check the financial forecast before they invest and end up getting soaked.
[00:21:21.656 --> 00:21:27.417]  Before you venture into the financial world, check the forecast with the International Forecaster Newsletter written by Bob Chapman.

[00:22:41.207 --> 00:22:41.688]  We'll be right back.
[00:23:01.155 --> 00:23:02.697]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[00:23:02.857 --> 00:23:03.979]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[00:23:04.159 --> 00:23:07.564]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:23:07.684 --> 00:23:08.124]  Phenol?
[00:23:08.425 --> 00:23:15.514]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[00:23:16.015 --> 00:23:19.940]  ATA may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[00:23:20.061 --> 00:23:20.501]  Fragrance?
[00:23:20.882 --> 00:23:25.628]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[00:23:25.768 --> 00:23:30.455]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discoloration, to name a few.
[00:23:30.695 --> 00:23:33.179]  Now, by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[00:23:33.499 --> 00:23:36.900]  Well, like all of the products from the Cal-Ben Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.622]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.

[00:24:06.309 --> 00:24:08.210]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:11.512]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:13.173 --> 00:24:15.074]  I know that we have loaded phone lines.
[00:24:15.794 --> 00:24:22.878]  We've got a guest coming on, the head legal counsel for the ACLU in Georgia about martial law in Georgia.
[00:24:22.898 --> 00:24:27.501]  That guest is only coming on for about ten minutes, the first ten minutes of the next segment.
[00:24:27.521 --> 00:24:29.082]  So we'll get to all of your calls.
[00:24:29.622 --> 00:24:32.544]  Those of you that are patiently holding, just be patient.
[00:24:32.584 --> 00:24:34.905]  Kevin and Tim and Rob and Tom and Lee and many others.
[00:24:36.434 --> 00:24:38.375]  I want to continue with some news right now.
[00:24:38.395 --> 00:24:40.795]  A warning or a threat.
[00:24:41.256 --> 00:24:43.936]  Hart says Hartland is a target.
[00:24:44.817 --> 00:24:47.958]  And again, it's Gary Hart that got up there just a few days after 9-11.
[00:24:49.038 --> 00:24:57.601]  We have this in my film, The Road to Tyranny, video of him saying we need to use this disaster to get a new world order.
[00:24:57.621 --> 00:25:03.563]  We need to use this disaster to create a new world order.
[00:25:04.153 --> 00:25:08.854]  And that's exactly what the PNAC documents, the CFR documents, called for.
[00:25:09.254 --> 00:25:15.176]  They said we need helpful terror attacks on the order of Pearl Harbor.
[00:25:15.576 --> 00:25:18.837]  I didn't think Pearl Harbor was helpful to you.
[00:25:19.017 --> 00:25:20.137]  2,800 and something people dead.
[00:25:20.478 --> 00:25:25.639]  Almost the exact number that died in the World Trade Centers and the Pentagon.
[00:25:27.361 --> 00:25:31.983]  And so now he's back out there beating the drums saying the terrorists are about to get you.
[00:25:32.444 --> 00:25:34.104]  You better give up all your rights.
[00:25:34.224 --> 00:25:35.645]  Heartland, you're not safe.
[00:25:36.125 --> 00:25:37.586]  The very definition of terrorism.
[00:25:37.626 --> 00:25:40.508]  You better give up your liberty or the bad man's going to get you.
[00:25:40.968 --> 00:25:47.511]  You better pay off the mafia or we're not going to be able to protect you from this wild man that wants to burn down your grocery store.
[00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:49.112]  It's the same M.O.
[00:25:49.898 --> 00:25:58.924]  Creating fear, threatening violence, or doing violence to get a political reaction or capitulation from a group or individual.
[00:25:58.944 --> 00:26:01.006]  I mean, this is the definition of terrorism.
[00:26:01.566 --> 00:26:07.730]  Issuing their fake terror alerts, running around fear-mongering, Kerry, Bush, Hart, all of them doing it together.
[00:26:09.812 --> 00:26:13.594]  Oil prices soar after deadly Saudi attack.
[00:26:13.834 --> 00:26:16.837]  January world oil markets opened today.
[00:26:18.214 --> 00:26:25.654]  With strong price increases and the first significant trending since the terror attack targeting Western oil workers left 22 people dead.
[00:26:26.889 --> 00:26:41.056]  In Beirut, where OPEC officials began to have a meeting, Saudi oil minister Ali Nami said the cartel would do its best to ensure that the crude companies are adequate to meet global demand.
[00:26:41.256 --> 00:26:53.642]  Saudi authorities, meanwhile, were still searching for three Islamic militants involved in the weekend shooting rampage and hostage standoff that left foreign businessmen reconsidering whether to stay in Saudi Arabia.
[00:26:53.702 --> 00:26:55.303]  Police responded to numerous tips
[00:26:55.783 --> 00:27:04.391]  Since the attackers fled the upscale Oasis residential compound Sunday, one said to be the ringleader was wounded and arrested at the compound.
[00:27:06.353 --> 00:27:08.534]  And here is the London Telegraph headline.
[00:27:08.675 --> 00:27:12.678]  Saudi security forces agreed to let al-Qaeda killers escape.
[00:27:13.118 --> 00:27:22.687]  Witnesses said yesterday that the terrorists who killed 22 civilians in Saudi Arabia and took more than 40 people hostage were let out of the besieged compound by security forces in an attempt...
[00:27:23.439 --> 00:27:26.860]  To deal, to avoid more people being killed.
[00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:33.341]  Saudi officials maintain that the kidnappers had used hostages as human shields before finding a vehicle and making their escape.
[00:27:33.582 --> 00:27:43.284]  However, an employee at the compound in Khobar said a hostage told him that he had heard the government shouting that they would release captive security forces and let them go.
[00:27:43.959 --> 00:27:51.126]  Security forces at first refused, but agreed after the militants, who also threatened to blow up the building, began killing hostages.
[00:27:51.446 --> 00:28:03.758]  As Saudi Arabia yesterday vowed to hunt down al-Qaeda deviants, a senior Saudi official claimed that five of the six terrorist cells known to be active in the country had been dismantled in the past year.
[00:28:04.378 --> 00:28:21.753]  An attempt to reassure the outside world that the security situation was under control, Prince Turki al-Faisal, the Saudi ambassador to London, said that there appeared to be no new recruits to the corps of al-Qaeda members identified last year by the Saudi intelligence services.
[00:28:23.295 --> 00:28:29.120]  And we've had top Saudis saying that it's the Western governments controlling al-Qaeda, that they're behind this destabilization.
[00:28:30.266 --> 00:28:38.988]  Meanwhile, CNN comes out and says that Saudi attack was a conspiracy.
[00:28:41.049 --> 00:28:47.191]  Saudi security forces allowed some kidnappers in the bloody weekend attack on a residential compound to flee because they threatened to blow up the building.
[00:28:47.211 --> 00:28:55.693]  According to reports, one employee of the Oasis compound said the day that the hostage heard the gunman shouting again that they would release the captives if the security forces let them go.
[00:28:57.208 --> 00:29:00.349]  Meanwhile, they're having the new supposed election.
[00:29:00.369 --> 00:29:04.191]  It's been going on throughout the weekend in Iraq.
[00:29:04.251 --> 00:29:17.436]  And if you read the fine print of even the mainstream news, it says that the appointees that our government appointed, that is the Halliburton government appointed, the Bremer government appointed, are now appointing themselves and others.
[00:29:18.276 --> 00:29:19.477]  And this is democracy.
[00:29:19.517 --> 00:29:24.839]  And the average person will tell you that we've brought Iraq freedom as our government appoints
[00:29:26.626 --> 00:29:30.387]  I mean, do I have to explain how this is a scam?
[00:29:30.827 --> 00:29:33.888]  I'm sure that people out there get this.
[00:29:34.588 --> 00:29:38.129]  So we'll go over that news as well.
[00:29:38.209 --> 00:29:40.410]  Bremer accused of interfering with the vote.
[00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:41.890]  They're calling it a vote.
[00:29:42.010 --> 00:29:44.291]  Their puppets appointing new puppets.
[00:29:45.151 --> 00:29:46.092]  It's all coming up.
[00:29:46.312 --> 00:29:47.712]  Please stay with us.
[00:29:51.893 --> 00:29:52.853]  We're on the march.
[00:29:53.294 --> 00:29:54.814]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.824 --> 00:29:58.498]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[00:30:01.630 --> 00:30:07.155]  Old timers remember a time when things were a bit slower, and most folks really did take the time to stop and smell the roses.
[00:30:07.396 --> 00:30:12.961]  That was back when gardeners grew tomatoes that tasted like tomato, and watermelons that tasted like watermelon was supposed to.
[00:30:13.201 --> 00:30:15.543]  Sweet corn that was real sweet sweet corn.
[00:30:15.683 --> 00:30:16.724]  Well, you get the idea.
[00:30:16.885 --> 00:30:26.794]  Too bad the big seed companies became big greed companies, and decided that hybrids grown in hothouses, artificially ripened with gas, could be grown much quicker, fetching more money at the large grocery stores.
[00:30:27.094 --> 00:30:36.563]  Folks at the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company remember that simpler time and are proud to be offering non-GMO heirloom seeds to gardeners who value flavor and variety over speed and greed.
[00:30:36.783 --> 00:30:45.872]  There's seed for fruits and vegetables of all kinds, seed for flowers and herbs, annuals and perennials, and some great books written by experts in the field to help get you started on the road to success.
[00:30:46.232 --> 00:30:48.456]  Call the Baker Creek Heirloom Seed Company at 417-924-8917.

[00:31:01.204 --> 00:31:03.165]  You've asked for them, and now they're here.
[00:31:03.245 --> 00:31:03.905]  Hello, folks.
[00:31:04.045 --> 00:31:13.970]  Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Lights Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:18.852]  The Berkey's PF2s simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[00:31:18.932 --> 00:31:30.258]  When used, water flow through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[00:31:30.618 --> 00:31:31.319]  We're good to go.
[00:32:00.538 --> 00:32:04.201]  There are no side effects.
[00:32:29.238 --> 00:32:29.719]  We're good to go.
[00:32:29.739 --> 00:32:30.219]  We're good to go.

[00:32:59.841 --> 00:33:00.461]  Call today.
[00:33:02.582 --> 00:33:07.705]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:08.386 --> 00:33:10.687]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:33:19.401 --> 00:33:20.442]  All right, my friends.
[00:33:20.742 --> 00:33:35.135]  On Infowars.com right now, you can read a bunch of different news articles, mainstream news articles, concerning Georgia and the G8 meeting, all the big Western leaders.
[00:33:36.437 --> 00:33:41.641]  Well, I guess counting Japan and a few others showing up to decide how to run our lives.
[00:33:42.281 --> 00:33:44.042]  And it's like it's China or something.
[00:33:44.823 --> 00:33:52.148]  Last week we started getting calls from listeners going, My local news in Georgia, my local news in Florida said no protesting is allowed.
[00:33:52.828 --> 00:33:59.493]  So we went and actually got the governor's proclamation, his new state of civil emergency proclamation,
[00:34:00.262 --> 00:34:01.023]  Great to be here.
[00:34:01.043 --> 00:34:02.744]  What exactly is going on in Georgia?
[00:34:30.336 --> 00:34:37.658]  Well, there have been a series of actions trying to restrict the rights of folks to protest during the G8 summit.
[00:34:38.459 --> 00:34:44.941]  All the cities and counties have adopted these new ordinances that are just sort of riddled with constitutional problems.
[00:34:45.061 --> 00:34:51.683]  And as of last week, the governor of Georgia declared what I guess can be described as a preemptive state of emergency.
[00:34:52.764 --> 00:34:53.584]  There's no flood.
[00:34:53.644 --> 00:34:56.985]  There's no dramatic event that's occurred.
[00:34:57.606 --> 00:34:57.966]  I think so.
[00:35:20.131 --> 00:35:23.433]  Vast powers to restrict First Amendment freedoms.
[00:35:23.633 --> 00:35:25.433]  Now that's not an overstatement.
[00:35:25.473 --> 00:35:30.656]  This is the textbook martial law where you don't have free speech, you don't have the right of assembly.
[00:35:30.996 --> 00:35:34.057]  This is what they had in the late 80s in Tiananmen Square.
[00:35:34.397 --> 00:35:38.339]  This is the same powers that they're declaring for themselves.
[00:35:38.899 --> 00:35:41.500]  Yeah, and they're declaring these powers preemptively.
[00:35:42.301 --> 00:35:49.684]  They say that the demonstrations are going to go forward, but at any given time the governor has the authority to shut them down.
[00:35:51.474 --> 00:35:55.960]  Well, now, according to the Associated Press, some of the cities are saying we're not going to allow them, period.
[00:35:57.081 --> 00:35:58.363]  They have tried to do that.
[00:35:58.423 --> 00:36:04.330]  We filed lawsuits against both the city of Savannah and the city of Brunswick, and then the two counties there.
[00:36:05.272 --> 00:36:06.733]  Now, you're in Georgia, sir.
[00:36:07.314 --> 00:36:09.137]  You're in Georgia, but a few months ago...
[00:36:10.172 --> 00:36:10.573]  Yeah.
[00:36:33.812 --> 00:36:44.574]  Well, actually, the ordinances that were passed here were developed by something called the G-8 Legal Subcommittee, which included federal officials, and they were instrumental in creating these unconstitutional laws.
[00:36:45.334 --> 00:36:46.234]  This is amazing.
[00:36:46.394 --> 00:36:49.395]  And this is happening all over the country, is it not?
[00:36:49.775 --> 00:36:50.615]  Oh, absolutely.
[00:36:50.735 --> 00:36:59.957]  I mean, this sort of equating of peaceful protesters with potential terrorists is a way of silencing free speech in this country.
[00:37:01.151 --> 00:37:08.654]  They had the Deputy Attorney General in California last year said, well, we made BAM protests in California because that aged terrorists.
[00:37:09.215 --> 00:37:11.796]  Did you see that in the Oakland Tribune?
[00:37:12.296 --> 00:37:13.296]  I hadn't seen that, no.
[00:37:13.757 --> 00:37:15.938]  I mean, am I living on a different planet?
[00:37:16.038 --> 00:37:18.179]  Is this a Twilight Zone episode, sir?
[00:37:18.679 --> 00:37:24.021]  Well, you're certainly living in a different country than you were living in in 1990 or 1989.
[00:37:25.262 --> 00:37:27.883]  There's a different attitude towards demonstrators and there's a...
[00:37:29.574 --> 00:37:43.460]  Well, I've seen the footage from Seattle to Miami where they're attacking federal judges, reporters.
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:51.524]  They're herding World War II vets down alleys and beating them up and pepper-spraying toddlers in their mommy's arms.
[00:37:51.544 --> 00:37:53.384]  I mean, this has all been caught on video.
[00:37:53.505 --> 00:37:54.265]  I've seen it.
[00:37:54.565 --> 00:37:55.746]  I've interviewed the people.
[00:37:57.066 --> 00:37:58.708]  What are they telling these police?
[00:37:58.788 --> 00:38:04.432]  How do they get police with their federally issued Darth Vader outfits to attack peaceful demonstrations?
[00:38:04.733 --> 00:38:05.733]  Well, we're very concerned.
[00:38:05.753 --> 00:38:12.139]  There's going to be over 20,000 law enforcement officers down there during the G8 summit.
[00:38:12.159 --> 00:38:14.921]  They've all been trained to expect the worst.
[00:38:15.541 --> 00:38:21.026]  And at the slightest indication of any problem, we're afraid that they're going to overreact.
[00:38:22.799 --> 00:38:30.426]  Now, Pacifica and others are reporting that the police chiefs are being given shoot-to-kill powers.
[00:38:30.606 --> 00:38:31.607]  Have you confirmed that?
[00:38:32.168 --> 00:38:33.429]  We haven't confirmed that, no.
[00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:42.217]  But I would be very worried about any demonstrator that actually tried to get onto Sea Island, the private island where the...
[00:38:42.987 --> 00:38:45.267]  The G8 officials are going to be.
[00:38:45.388 --> 00:38:46.168]  Now, that's a good point.
[00:38:46.208 --> 00:38:47.868]  They've got a natural moat there.
[00:38:47.888 --> 00:38:52.749]  They're on this island off the coast, but most of the state itself is under martial law.
[00:38:53.309 --> 00:38:53.529]  Right.
[00:38:53.569 --> 00:39:04.271]  They've declared six counties under martial law in the surrounding area, and Sea Island itself is a private island, and no one will be allowed onto that island.
[00:39:04.372 --> 00:39:06.612]  It sort of creates a protest zone.
[00:39:07.442 --> 00:39:15.625]  Where the protesters are so far away that there's no way there'll be an eye shot or ear shot of a single person who's involved in the G8 summit itself.
[00:39:15.785 --> 00:39:22.288]  So we put up with free speech zones where you have 500 pro-Bush people, one guy with a sign saying no blood for oil.
[00:39:23.121 --> 00:39:28.026]  And they arrest him, and a federal judge in Virginia, or was it Georgia?
[00:39:28.046 --> 00:39:33.110]  It was last year, says, yeah, you're going to go ahead and serve prison time.
[00:39:34.211 --> 00:39:37.254]  We can selectively say where you can protest and what you can do.
[00:39:37.815 --> 00:39:39.096]  Now they're going even further.
[00:39:39.116 --> 00:39:41.578]  I mean, how does this go further than just free speech zones?
[00:39:41.899 --> 00:39:47.263]  Well, this is sort of a geographic protest zone in that they've got an isolated island.
[00:39:48.451 --> 00:39:56.342]  It's almost as though the demonstrators have scared the world leaders off into some island because they don't want to confront democracy.
[00:39:56.382 --> 00:40:00.909]  They don't want to confront opinions that don't match theirs.
[00:40:02.665 --> 00:40:08.688]  Well, I've just got a few other questions for you, and we'll let you go, and I hope to have you on, sir, during the demonstration or one of your colleagues.
[00:40:08.788 --> 00:40:12.530]  But, I mean, this is an issue that should bring conservatives and liberals alike together.
[00:40:12.570 --> 00:40:13.971]  I think it is starting to do that.
[00:40:13.991 --> 00:40:23.536]  I mean, even Bob Barr has now joined you guys and is saying that these attacks on liberties are more disastrous for America than the attacks themselves.
[00:40:23.616 --> 00:40:27.358]  Bush said that the terrorists attacked us because they hate our freedom.
[00:40:27.398 --> 00:40:28.339]  I guess that's true.
[00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:30.300]  He wants to now get rid of our freedoms.
[00:40:30.340 --> 00:40:31.380]  Then maybe they'll love us.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.241]  I mean, this is crazy.
[00:40:33.018 --> 00:40:43.465]  Yeah, I think anybody who disagrees with the administration is perceived as sort of an enemy of the state to the extent that their First Amendment freedoms don't mean what they used to.
[00:40:43.965 --> 00:40:53.672]  Are you familiar with a national talk show host on radio and TV calling for interning anyone that disagrees with the government, calling for the Sedition Act to be put into place?
[00:40:54.192 --> 00:40:55.013]  Doesn't surprise me.
[00:40:57.005 --> 00:40:59.186]  What is the feedback you're getting in Georgia?
[00:40:59.747 --> 00:41:04.729]  Because we've had listeners in Georgia and surrounding states calling in saying, I saw the nightly news.
[00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:07.310]  They laughed and said no protest allowed.
[00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:08.691]  I mean, what's the atmosphere?
[00:41:08.711 --> 00:41:09.491]  What are people saying?
[00:41:09.952 --> 00:41:18.956]  Well, the atmosphere is such that both of the cities have actually issued an order that anyone taking a photograph of a non-tourist site is subject to question.
[00:41:19.717 --> 00:41:24.459]  So people throughout those cities are actually being questioned just because they clipped the camera
[00:41:25.457 --> 00:41:28.339]  On something that the police didn't consider to be a tourist site.
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:32.602]  Now, even in Beijing, because I have family that's been there, you're allowed to take photos.
[00:41:32.622 --> 00:41:35.765]  You're saying we're going to be more restrictive than communist China?
[00:41:36.826 --> 00:41:46.312]  It sounds like it, at least to the extent that, you know, even reporters have been questioned by the police when they photographed an accident scene in Savannah.
[00:41:47.073 --> 00:41:48.454]  It's a crazy atmosphere.
[00:41:48.494 --> 00:41:51.356]  It's very, very disturbing and
[00:41:52.129 --> 00:41:55.210]  We have to hope for the best over the next week or two.
[00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:58.091]  Any other developments we should be aware of, Mr. Weber?
[00:41:58.952 --> 00:42:12.197]  Well, we're continuing to work through our lawsuits that will hopefully give sites for the protesters, and we're going to be down there monitoring and making sure that the police don't step over the line, or at least we document when they do.
[00:42:12.457 --> 00:42:15.098]  What is your brief stating tomorrow in the federal court?
[00:42:15.918 --> 00:42:20.520]  We're basically trying to work out the protest sites and the cities and counties are...
[00:42:21.107 --> 00:42:25.228]  All changing their ordinances to make them, I guess, close enough for government work.
[00:42:25.288 --> 00:42:31.349]  They're not perfect, but they're an improvement over the ordinances they passed to silence the protesters.
[00:42:31.409 --> 00:42:37.770]  I'm sure you're aware that they also, the police will cut out police monitors, take them to a site to severely beat them.
[00:42:38.250 --> 00:42:42.131]  We've confirmed this in Portland, Oregon and Miami, Florida.
[00:42:43.091 --> 00:42:43.311]  Right.
[00:42:44.651 --> 00:42:49.572]  So I guess we've got to have watchers who are covertly watching the monitors.
[00:42:50.512 --> 00:42:57.695]  Yeah, we're watching the watchmen, and we're going to do what we can to document any abuses that might occur.
[00:42:57.715 --> 00:43:02.677]  Are people in Georgia aware that this really is textbook martial law?
[00:43:03.457 --> 00:43:10.960]  I think that there is a growing concern about what's happening, but so far it's all sort of preemptive.
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:13.101]  The demonstrators haven't arrived.
[00:43:13.121 --> 00:43:15.182]  The actions haven't occurred.
[00:43:15.242 --> 00:43:20.224]  It's going to be really interesting to see how the public reacts and how the police react
[00:43:20.974 --> 00:43:22.075]  During the summit itself.
[00:43:22.415 --> 00:43:25.758]  Do you have any information on the Georgia ACLU website for people?
[00:43:26.258 --> 00:43:27.139]  Yeah, absolutely.
[00:43:27.199 --> 00:43:34.805]  We have some of the lawsuits online and some of our press releases, and you can go to ACLUGA.org.
[00:43:35.406 --> 00:43:37.908]  ACLUGA.org.
[00:43:38.508 --> 00:43:46.455]  Jerry Weber, hope to have you back on during the summit or after the summit for your report, and we appreciate you defending our constitutional republic.
[00:43:46.495 --> 00:43:46.975]  Take care.
[00:43:47.315 --> 00:43:47.696]  Thank you.
[00:43:47.756 --> 00:43:48.476]  Keep up the good work.
[00:43:48.757 --> 00:43:49.177]  I'll try.
[00:43:50.407 --> 00:44:00.275]  Now, again, what the ACLU does is they go out and take real cases and drop the ball, whether you can say on purpose or by accident.
[00:44:00.675 --> 00:44:06.599]  But there are some good people in the ACLU, and it has been strengthened and has been taking on some real issues.
[00:44:06.699 --> 00:44:09.361]  And I think that Mr. Weber is doing a pretty good job.
[00:44:09.722 --> 00:44:13.424]  And he's there on the ground trying to block all this, so that's why we got him on the show.
[00:44:14.005 --> 00:44:17.868]  Your calls are coming up here in just a moment or so.
[00:44:19.577 --> 00:44:21.659]  I am just sitting here in stunned amazement.
[00:44:21.699 --> 00:44:22.240]  You heard him.
[00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:23.521]  Martial law.
[00:44:24.522 --> 00:44:30.847]  We have General Tommy Frank saying, next attack, we set aside the Constitution in favor of a military form of government.
[00:44:31.247 --> 00:44:39.074]  General Eberhardt spouting off in the LA Times, the head of our new military directorate and governorship based in Colorado Springs.
[00:44:39.094 --> 00:44:42.457]  We're also on the radio, of course, on the AM dial.
[00:44:43.819 --> 00:44:45.620]  And I'd like to hear from listeners out there.
[00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:46.361]  I mean, this is...
[00:44:47.034 --> 00:44:48.614]  They're telling us, give up your liberties.
[00:44:48.654 --> 00:44:54.055]  Give us Patriot Act 2.5, because they passed part of Patriot Act 2, not the entire thing.
[00:44:54.095 --> 00:44:55.876]  Bush now wants 2.5.
[00:44:55.936 --> 00:44:57.036]  Don't just reauthorize it.
[00:44:57.136 --> 00:44:57.836]  Expand it.
[00:44:59.497 --> 00:45:01.997]  I've got a whole stack of Big Brother news here.
[00:45:02.057 --> 00:45:06.018]  The pizza man, the phone man, the tips system on steroids.
[00:45:07.318 --> 00:45:08.358]  Not looking for terrorists.
[00:45:08.378 --> 00:45:10.999]  Well, under their guidelines, all crimes are terror.
[00:45:11.719 --> 00:45:13.159]  Spying on you at your home.
[00:45:13.179 --> 00:45:16.740]  I mean, it's just, this isn't America.
[00:45:17.935 --> 00:45:23.979]  Let's go to the calls quickly, and then there's just a whole other cornucopia of bombshell news here.
[00:45:24.659 --> 00:45:26.140]  Kevin in North Carolina.
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.361]  Kevin, you're our first caller.
[00:45:27.621 --> 00:45:28.482]  Thank you for holding.
[00:45:29.623 --> 00:45:30.403]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[00:45:30.603 --> 00:45:31.144]  Good, my friend.
[00:45:31.404 --> 00:45:36.387]  Hey, buddy, listen, I seen something earlier this weekend kind of caught my eye on the ticker on WB22.
[00:45:36.527 --> 00:45:38.508]  It'd be newscentral.com.
[00:45:39.289 --> 00:45:43.932]  Thousands of foreign troops and sailors gearing up for exercise off the North Carolina coast.
[00:45:43.992 --> 00:45:46.854]  Now, I don't know if that's related to the G8 summit or whatever, but
[00:45:47.979 --> 00:45:55.248]  And then it made me realize I'd seen Chaney praising them for a good job they had done, the Coast Guard that is, patrolling our Rats Coast.
[00:45:55.308 --> 00:45:56.971]  I guess this is our new Coast Guard.
[00:45:57.451 --> 00:46:00.195]  Also other things I've seen lately coming up this weekend.
[00:46:00.805 --> 00:46:02.206]  Was gun amnesty.
[00:46:02.246 --> 00:46:04.088]  Turning your guns, no questions asked.
[00:46:04.148 --> 00:46:05.769]  That's a rare thing to see around here.
[00:46:05.829 --> 00:46:15.818]  And that trains you to see the news images of lines of people turning their guns, and they've done it in Canada and Australia, then they start banning the guns, and then you've got to turn them in.
[00:46:16.659 --> 00:46:24.065]  Email me that article to tips at InfoWars.com or go to PrisonPlanet.com and click on where it says Contact Webmaster.
[00:46:24.325 --> 00:46:26.127]  That's a good place to send news tips.
[00:46:26.947 --> 00:46:28.809]  Because Paul checks it about five times a day.
[00:46:28.849 --> 00:46:31.031]  We just check ours once or twice a day.
[00:46:31.651 --> 00:46:34.174]  Well, I run kind of a primitive deal there.
[00:46:34.314 --> 00:46:36.976]  I don't have no email anyway to do anything like that.
[00:46:37.076 --> 00:46:40.339]  I just stay on top of the job I can do to do my best.
[00:46:40.399 --> 00:46:42.080]  You just surf the web.
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:42.801]  You don't have email.
[00:46:43.243 --> 00:46:44.323]  Yeah, I don't have anything.
[00:46:44.363 --> 00:46:49.085]  I don't have anything but a short wave and good ears.
[00:46:49.245 --> 00:46:51.466]  What did the article then... Okay, so you were watching television.
[00:46:51.486 --> 00:46:52.707]  I thought you said it was online.
[00:46:52.927 --> 00:46:55.948]  No, it was WB22, and I was just giving the website out.
[00:46:56.148 --> 00:46:59.189]  And what did they announce that the loving foreign troops were doing?
[00:46:59.229 --> 00:47:00.589]  And they wouldn't even do a story on it.
[00:47:00.650 --> 00:47:05.691]  It was at a ticker on the bottom, and I sat there and watched the ticker roll around three times to make sure I got it right.
[00:47:05.731 --> 00:47:07.332]  I wrote it down, but I don't even need to write it down.
[00:47:07.352 --> 00:47:07.932]  What did it say?
[00:47:08.112 --> 00:47:12.534]  Thousands of foreign troops and sailors gearing up for exercise off the North Carolina coast.
[00:47:13.409 --> 00:47:14.810]  That's word for word.
[00:47:15.250 --> 00:47:16.271]  Kevin, thanks for the call.
[00:47:17.532 --> 00:47:18.853]  Try to find something on that.
[00:47:19.693 --> 00:47:32.322]  Simultaneously from California to West Virginia to North Carolina to Georgia to Florida to Texas, urban warfare training drills with Special Forces Army, Special Forces Marines.
[00:47:33.062 --> 00:47:36.424]  ...are doing gun confiscation drills, house-to-house searches.
[00:47:36.825 --> 00:47:41.288]  They're covertly leasing buildings and then blowing them up, terrorizing the citizenry.
[00:47:41.868 --> 00:47:45.510]  This has been going on for over a decade, and now it's intensifying.
[00:47:45.550 --> 00:47:48.212]  And then out west we see foreign troops.
[00:47:48.292 --> 00:47:50.033]  In south Texas we see foreign troops.
[00:47:50.374 --> 00:47:52.575]  These are all confirmed instances I'm mentioning.
[00:47:52.595 --> 00:47:55.557]  They're in my two, now three, police state films.
[00:47:56.458 --> 00:47:57.999]  And then now it just heightened.
[00:47:58.859 --> 00:47:59.700]  It's conditioning.
[00:48:00.060 --> 00:48:01.461]  It's acclimation.
[00:48:02.691 --> 00:48:05.632]  In seven days after 9-11, I saw U.N.
[00:48:05.712 --> 00:48:08.913]  Head General McKenzie on nightline.
[00:48:09.853 --> 00:48:11.493]  Didn't have a tape running, which I did.
[00:48:12.473 --> 00:48:21.416]  I flipped to him, and he just flipped to the channel, and he said, what we've got to do is have a continental security perimeter patrolled by United Nations forces.
[00:48:21.456 --> 00:48:22.836]  That'll keep America safe.
[00:48:22.876 --> 00:48:30.678]  And then we had the 56 Norwegian F-16s, the 12 French and German AWACS,
[00:48:32.037 --> 00:48:35.198]  This is how they break the ice and get you ready for all of it.
[00:48:35.958 --> 00:48:37.999]  And it is really going on.
[00:48:38.439 --> 00:48:39.479]  Tim in Ohio.
[00:48:39.559 --> 00:48:40.439]  Tim, you're on the air.
[00:48:40.479 --> 00:48:40.960]  Go ahead.
[00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:42.080]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:43.340]  Welcome.
[00:48:44.061 --> 00:48:51.483]  Does this fall under the umbrella, I guess, of the Rex 84 Alpha program and things like Operation Garden Plot?
[00:48:52.023 --> 00:48:53.063]  And Cable Splicer.
[00:48:53.083 --> 00:48:53.783]  Cable Splicer, yeah.
[00:48:53.803 --> 00:48:54.424]  Is that what all this is?
[00:48:54.444 --> 00:48:55.264]  Yeah, what happens is...
[00:48:57.839 --> 00:49:09.588]  We, 10, 20, 30 years after the fact, get declassified programs like Rex 84, Cable Splicer, Garden Plot, Giant Concentration Camp, Roundup Plans, public stuff.
[00:49:09.988 --> 00:49:14.512]  I've got Senate hearings in the takeover, clips of this being discussed.
[00:49:15.373 --> 00:49:18.615]  So we know the old names, we don't know the new names.
[00:49:19.215 --> 00:49:23.799]  But the new name for all of it is called Homeland Security and Borderline.
[00:49:24.557 --> 00:49:29.767]  It all feeds into NORTHCOM, or the North American Military Dictatorship.
[00:49:30.709 --> 00:49:34.436]  Now, I was also reading, and perhaps you could clarify this for me a little bit,
[00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:42.935]  That they were actually thinking about condensing the United States into like ten five-state regions.
[00:49:43.096 --> 00:49:44.957]  We're already under ten FEMA regions.
[00:49:45.777 --> 00:49:53.863]  Even before FEMA got enacted in 1979, I have the actual New York Times front page articles in 1937 showing the ten regions.
[00:49:54.363 --> 00:49:56.064]  The ten regions have already been merged.
[00:49:56.104 --> 00:49:58.066]  We're already merged with Canada and Mexico.
[00:49:58.086 --> 00:50:01.128]  And under the free trade area of the Americas, it's being completed.
[00:50:01.168 --> 00:50:04.750]  The Amero dollar has publicly been announced, and it's all moving forward.
[00:50:05.330 --> 00:50:08.431]  And I just want to mention one more thing, if I can, quickly about... It's just like the EU.
[00:50:09.092 --> 00:50:11.292]  People didn't even know about the EU until it was already official.
[00:50:11.332 --> 00:50:11.613]  Go ahead.
[00:50:11.633 --> 00:50:11.713]  Sure.
[00:50:11.813 --> 00:50:14.394]  Just one more thing about the draft.
[00:50:14.694 --> 00:50:28.159]  This past Friday, on the CBS affiliate up in Cleveland, the general manager comes on and does his weekly pompous editorial, and a couple of quotes from it this week is, there is not going to be a draft.
[00:50:28.579 --> 00:50:29.199]  No way.
[00:50:29.899 --> 00:50:34.101]  There, you heard it here first, and he finished it up with like it would be some type of
[00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:39.164]  Political suicide for the president to institute a draft in an election year.
[00:50:39.384 --> 00:50:40.345]  Oh, no, don't worry.
[00:50:40.505 --> 00:50:43.087]  We have the official documents that's coming up.
[00:50:43.487 --> 00:50:47.150]  The draft comes after the election, right after a big terror attack.
[00:50:48.011 --> 00:50:50.113]  Oh, we've got to do it to defend the homeland.
[00:50:50.954 --> 00:50:52.255]  Twelve bills are introduced.
[00:50:52.295 --> 00:50:53.856]  The draft boards have been set back up.
[00:50:54.136 --> 00:50:57.639]  Conscription is being prepared for women with selective service.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.140]  Good points.
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:50:59.681]  Thanks for the call.
[00:51:01.678 --> 00:51:06.021]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:51:06.221 --> 00:51:10.664]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:51:10.804 --> 00:51:15.167]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[00:51:15.207 --> 00:51:16.568]  The New World Order.
[00:51:18.350 --> 00:51:22.574]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:51:22.634 --> 00:51:29.562]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:51:29.702 --> 00:51:31.705]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:51:32.085 --> 00:51:42.492]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:51:42.692 --> 00:51:48.056]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[00:52:11.229 --> 00:52:21.592]  Ideal for travel or outdoor events and perfect in the event of hostile filtration environments such as local or national emergencies because they remove both harmful chemicals and pathogenic bacteria from water.
[00:52:21.752 --> 00:52:26.093]  So powerful they can remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites to non-detectable levels.
[00:52:26.293 --> 00:52:27.053]  Try Halo Methane.
[00:52:27.373 --> 00:52:34.616]  and volatile organic chemicals such as atrazine, benzene, chlorine, chloroform, and NTBE are removed to below detectable limits.
[00:52:34.916 --> 00:52:41.278]  They reduce nitrate and unwanted metals such as lead, mercury, aluminum, copper, and foul taste like chlorine and sulfur odors.
[00:52:41.398 --> 00:52:45.860]  Yet the Black Berkey filter elements leave them the helpful and beneficial minerals that your body needs.

[00:54:08.030 --> 00:54:19.040]  You know, my friends, I cannot stress enough how serious things are.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:22.263]  All the indicators, all the propaganda preparation.
[00:54:23.348 --> 00:54:29.211]  They're crossing every T, dotting every I, telling you martial law is good, it's for your safety.
[00:54:29.752 --> 00:54:38.437]  For years, all these top officials in FEMA, you name it, out saying under a red alert, all your liberties are stripped, you're an enemy combatant, you can't leave your home.
[00:54:39.237 --> 00:54:43.519]  We're going to take your children from the public schools and take them to FEMA centers, Washington Post.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:46.641]  You've got to turn your guns in after the terrorist attack.
[00:54:47.522 --> 00:54:51.404]  And they're just lining up all their ducks in a row, getting ready for it.
[00:54:52.794 --> 00:54:55.821]  Getting the police ready for it so when they give the order it happens.
[00:54:55.881 --> 00:54:59.169]  We had to do it because the terrorist attacked us.
[00:55:00.675 --> 00:55:06.037]  You know, and I like having lots of power and wearing black ski masks and arresting people.
[00:55:06.417 --> 00:55:08.018]  Our country got hit hard.
[00:55:08.478 --> 00:55:10.259]  Major city got nuked.
[00:55:10.879 --> 00:55:11.219]  Nuked.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:19.723]  We've got to give up all our rights and get behind a war to invade everybody and have a big national draft and national compulsory service.
[00:55:19.803 --> 00:55:22.304]  And we've got to be slaves of the government.
[00:55:22.724 --> 00:55:29.447]  The government hates being the boss and running everything and a few private companies owning the government and getting all the contracts, but...
[00:55:30.350 --> 00:55:33.712]  We just got to be their slaves to be safe!
[00:55:34.033 --> 00:55:35.634]  We just got to do it!
[00:55:35.894 --> 00:55:36.875]  Got to do it!
[00:55:37.535 --> 00:55:43.159]  You know, throughout history, governments hate being the rulers and hate using crises to do it.
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:51.605]  We're going to start the next hour in a minute and I'll go to Rob and Lee and Shazam and JR and others.
[00:55:53.686 --> 00:55:54.867]  So stay with us, folks.
[00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:56.920]  You know, I got a family.
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:57.780]  I love my family.
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:55:59.261]  I'm so angry at the globalists.
[00:55:59.281 --> 00:56:00.422]  They're a bunch of killers.
[00:56:01.282 --> 00:56:09.387]  You got a bunch of weak-minded people that enjoy power, that make up their command and control system, and you guys and girls need to stop being so stupid.
[00:56:10.188 --> 00:56:13.030]  Those of you in this system, and wake up and face what you're a part of.
[00:56:13.350 --> 00:56:23.336]  And those of you, the yuppies out there that think you're part of this system and just think it's all cute and dandy, who don't have the courage to face it either, you're the real target of all this, you fools.
[00:56:23.396 --> 00:56:24.857]  It's not the Arabs, okay?
[00:56:26.989 --> 00:56:31.957]  All the real preparations are for the Christian conservatives, those that won't go along with the microchipping.
[00:56:32.338 --> 00:56:34.942]  I got Newsweek magazine here in front of me.
[00:56:36.272 --> 00:56:40.534]  Saying the future of shopping and says, yep, we're all going to have microchips to buy and sell.
[00:56:40.594 --> 00:56:41.735]  It's completely normal.
[00:56:42.135 --> 00:56:44.116]  See, right out in the open, acting like it's normal.
[00:56:44.396 --> 00:56:49.158]  And to people who have no moral compass, no history, no understanding, they go, okay, I'll take a chip.
[00:56:49.538 --> 00:56:50.659]  Newsweek says it's good.
[00:56:50.679 --> 00:56:56.502]  I mean, they're actually in major magazines saying we're all going to have to have chips.
[00:56:56.622 --> 00:57:00.744]  I mean, do I have to explain how horrible things are here?
[00:57:02.353 --> 00:57:06.776]  Oh, I mean, they're on television saying, take chips!
[00:57:09.737 --> 00:57:12.339]  This is not some science fiction horror movie.
[00:57:12.359 --> 00:57:13.659]  This is not The Matrix.
[00:57:13.979 --> 00:57:15.860]  This is really happening.
[00:57:16.001 --> 00:57:19.863]  And they've got a program to watch everything you do called The Matrix.
[00:57:19.903 --> 00:57:21.804]  They're throwing it in your face.
[00:57:22.164 --> 00:57:25.966]  The symbol of it is an all-seeing eye looking down on the world.
[00:57:27.873 --> 00:57:45.988]  Before I end this hour, if you want to fight these murderers, if you want to expose these criminals, get 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, get Masters of Terror, get Police State, Three Total Enslavement, get Matrix of Evil, get my powerful videos, get another VCR, and make copies of them like America Depends on It, because frankly, it does.
[00:57:46.068 --> 00:57:47.590]  And this is the best tool I've found.
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:50.281]  Order the videos right now.
[00:57:50.401 --> 00:57:52.542]  If you've got copies of them, make copies.
[00:57:52.602 --> 00:57:55.604]  Don't sit there and let these killers get away with it.
[00:57:56.084 --> 00:57:57.584]  We've got a chance to stop them.
[00:57:57.605 --> 00:57:59.585]  They would have already moved ahead if it wasn't for you.
[00:57:59.886 --> 00:58:01.506]  We've got to redouble our efforts now.
[00:58:01.566 --> 00:58:02.647]  We're on the edge here.
[00:58:03.519 --> 00:58:04.920]  Call right now and get the films.
[00:58:04.940 --> 00:58:05.661]  1-888-253-3139.
[00:58:05.681 --> 00:58:06.001]  That's 888-253-3139.

[00:58:12.986 --> 00:58:17.189]  Or write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[00:58:32.114 --> 00:58:33.095]  I love my country.
[00:58:33.195 --> 00:58:34.277]  I know our government's criminal.
[00:58:34.917 --> 00:58:36.379]  And it's up to you to take action.
[00:58:36.399 --> 00:58:38.301]  Don't let these people get away with what they're doing.
[00:58:39.522 --> 00:58:42.385]  Don't just sit there quietly in the bleachers and get run over.
[00:58:42.886 --> 00:58:44.788]  Get on the field now!
[00:58:45.489 --> 00:58:46.810]  I'm telling you, it's coming.
[00:58:47.091 --> 00:58:49.353]  The next level of escalation is upon us.
[00:58:49.433 --> 00:58:50.735]  We've got to scream.
[00:58:52.077 --> 00:59:00.705]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[00:59:00.925 --> 00:59:12.155]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals, and they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, foul tastes, and much, much more.
[00:59:12.395 --> 00:59:15.058]  Yet they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[00:59:15.398 --> 00:59:21.864]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[00:59:22.024 --> 00:59:23.886]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[00:59:24.086 --> 00:59:30.112]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport even while it's filtering water.
[00:59:30.372 --> 00:59:36.038]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[00:59:36.358 --> 00:59:40.281]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[00:59:40.301 --> 00:59:41.022]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.
[00:59:41.042 --> 00:59:42.083]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[00:59:42.243 --> 00:59:42.543]  Big Brother
[00:59:59.384 --> 01:00:00.445]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:01.165 --> 01:00:02.266]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:02.926 --> 01:00:03.727]  You want answers?
[01:00:04.487 --> 01:00:05.407]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:05.428 --> 01:00:09.730]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:14.353]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:15.493 --> 01:00:21.977]  All right, we're already 25 seconds into the second hour of global transmission against tyranny.
[01:00:23.318 --> 01:00:27.280]  Radiating out on the AM and FM dial from Los Angeles, California.
[01:00:28.027 --> 01:00:49.237]  The Providence, Rhode Island, simulcasting on WWCR, global shortwave at 94.75 from 11 to 2 during the day, back from 9 to midnight at 32.10, and with one of the biggest internet listening audiences on the internet at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com, and the Earth is being turned into a prison planet.
[01:00:49.918 --> 01:00:53.919]  We just had the head legal counsel for the ACLU on in Georgia.
[01:00:54.019 --> 01:00:54.679]  It's official.
[01:00:55.079 --> 01:01:03.462]  Martial law in most of that state has been declared preemptively just to make sure the world leaders are safe at the G8.
[01:01:03.482 --> 01:01:07.063]  We've got the Iraq news, the oil news, the police state news.
[01:01:07.583 --> 01:01:08.323]  It's all coming up.
[01:01:08.403 --> 01:01:10.384]  Ann Paul Watson joining us in about 30 minutes.
[01:01:10.704 --> 01:01:12.444]  Right now, let's go back to the calls.
[01:01:12.524 --> 01:01:17.146]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rob in Wyoming, then Lee, Shazam, J.R., Lewis, and others.
[01:01:17.186 --> 01:01:17.846]  Go ahead, Rob.
[01:01:18.413 --> 01:01:23.735]  Hey Alex, I got a slogan for one of your T-shirts, Paul Joseph Watson's T-shirts.
[01:01:24.976 --> 01:01:25.356]  Jail.
[01:01:25.796 --> 01:01:27.357]  It's not just for criminals anymore.
[01:01:31.018 --> 01:01:31.558]  Jail?
[01:01:31.998 --> 01:01:32.979]  It's run by the criminals.
[01:01:33.919 --> 01:01:35.580]  What else is on your mind?
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:43.003]  I don't know what the sociopaths in charge will do, but I think I know what their Machiavellian think tanks are advising them to do if they're smart.
[01:01:43.564 --> 01:01:53.371]  Could be wrong, but because they're well aware that, you know, I'd say 40%, at least, of the population knows that it's impossible, this official explanation.
[01:01:53.391 --> 01:01:54.612]  It had to be an inside job.
[01:01:54.632 --> 01:01:56.854]  Talking about 9-11.
[01:01:57.094 --> 01:01:57.274]  Right.
[01:01:57.554 --> 01:02:02.938]  And for them to truly have another major attack, when what they're doing seems to be working pretty good, except for one thing.
[01:02:02.978 --> 01:02:07.902]  The protests are still focused and concentrated by having Bush up there on center stage.
[01:02:08.562 --> 01:02:11.785]  By having Kerry replace him and continue the exact same policies...
[01:02:12.629 --> 01:02:13.930]  It fades away a little bit.
[01:02:13.971 --> 01:02:16.593]  It dissipates the concentrated focus.
[01:02:17.294 --> 01:02:18.675]  That's what I believe they would do.
[01:02:18.916 --> 01:02:25.142]  As far as the next attack, I believe they'll have Peter Jennings and Dan Rather help set this up for several hours or days even.
[01:02:25.642 --> 01:02:29.166]  Oh, there's a suitcase nuke thought to be somewhere in a major city.
[01:02:29.676 --> 01:02:31.477]  Well, I'm sure they've thought of this already.
[01:02:52.822 --> 01:02:59.287]  They paid a top Hollywood script house $40 million two years ago to, quote, come up with scenarios.
[01:02:59.647 --> 01:03:00.808]  That's the Associated Press.
[01:03:01.188 --> 01:03:02.249]  That's why I think Kerry will win.
[01:03:02.289 --> 01:03:13.317]  And by the way, did you notice on these Memorial Day celebrations, the Revolutionary War heroes that not only fought for freedom but fought to establish freedom here are never mentioned?
[01:03:14.478 --> 01:03:15.219]  No, they're not.
[01:03:16.039 --> 01:03:18.401]  Only our gracious torture masters are worshipped.
[01:03:19.947 --> 01:03:21.988]  A gaggle of chicken hawks standing up there.
[01:03:22.008 --> 01:03:22.648]  Thanks for the call.
[01:03:23.729 --> 01:03:26.790]  Let's go ahead and talk to Lee in Michigan.
[01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:27.670]  Lee, go ahead.
[01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:29.631]  Yes, Alex, how are you doing today?
[01:03:29.651 --> 01:03:30.371]  Fine, sir.
[01:03:30.691 --> 01:03:31.232]  Well, good.
[01:03:31.972 --> 01:03:33.573]  I've got a question I wanted to ask you.
[01:03:34.153 --> 01:03:41.336]  How long do you think it will be before the federal government cuts down on all these shortwave broadcasts?
[01:03:42.256 --> 01:03:44.837]  Last night, I was listening to WWCR,
[01:03:47.345 --> 01:03:56.034]  And they were cut off for a period of 10 minutes and for a period of 15 minutes on one show when the talk show host started to talk about certain items.
[01:03:57.615 --> 01:03:59.117]  I'm not familiar with that, sir.
[01:03:59.317 --> 01:04:04.302]  I mean, there's all different sorts of censorship going on in the mainstream media.
[01:04:05.123 --> 01:04:06.965]  There's all sorts of problems.
[01:04:07.726 --> 01:04:10.849]  They've got this new data transmission down power lines.
[01:04:11.833 --> 01:04:24.463]  That they say is capable of hurting not just shortwave, but AM broadcast, and they're moving forward with that, so that's just going to blank out whole spectrums by itself.
[01:04:25.544 --> 01:04:27.826]  Well, last night I was listening to the Steve Quayle show.
[01:04:28.306 --> 01:04:32.890]  At the bottom of the hour, he started talking about something, and they cut him off for ten minutes.
[01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:35.652]  Well, occasionally, you know, transmitters have problems.
[01:04:36.973 --> 01:04:38.995]  So did they say it was intentional work?
[01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:41.222]  Well, they didn't say it was intentional.
[01:04:41.282 --> 01:04:42.404]  You know, that happens.
[01:04:42.524 --> 01:04:43.124]  That happens.
[01:04:44.346 --> 01:04:45.768]  So I would find out first.
[01:04:46.829 --> 01:04:48.271]  Hey, listen, thanks for the call.
[01:04:48.331 --> 01:04:49.552]  I appreciate it.
[01:04:49.592 --> 01:04:51.475]  We'll come right back and take more of your calls to us.
[01:04:53.504 --> 01:05:00.369]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here and I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1 The Road to Tyranny on DVD.
[01:05:00.669 --> 01:05:02.050]  That's right folks, DVD.
[01:05:02.230 --> 01:05:04.451]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:05:04.591 --> 01:05:06.673]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:05:06.953 --> 01:05:11.896]  If you want to wake up your friends and family to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:05:12.236 --> 01:05:16.279]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:05:16.519 --> 01:05:18.280]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:29.004]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and viable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:05:29.164 --> 01:05:31.065]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:05:31.265 --> 01:05:35.107]  Order your copy on VHS or DVD today and man the guns of the Infowar.
[01:05:35.227 --> 01:05:36.647]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533-139.
[01:05:36.687 --> 01:05:36.867]  That's 888-2533-139.

[01:05:47.595 --> 01:05:48.356]  Again, that number, 888-253-3139.
[01:05:52.887 --> 01:06:00.713]  Terrorism, terrorism, chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, anthrax, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic.
[01:06:00.974 --> 01:06:02.555]  Alarming words for our time.
[01:06:02.815 --> 01:06:05.277]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:06:05.677 --> 01:06:20.249]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:06:20.289 --> 01:06:20.609]  government.
[01:06:20.789 --> 01:06:22.591]  Anyone can follow the simple instructions.
[01:06:22.951 --> 01:06:28.873]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:06:28.994 --> 01:06:33.495]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video sheltering in place.
[01:06:33.735 --> 01:06:41.158]  Get the critical information you need now for only $29 plus shipping by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438 and tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[01:06:41.178 --> 01:06:43.159]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at murkywater.com.
[01:06:52.705 --> 01:06:53.706]  It's finally here.
[01:06:53.846 --> 01:06:54.827]  Spring has arrived.
[01:06:55.027 --> 01:06:57.990]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[01:06:58.190 --> 01:07:01.653]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[01:07:01.873 --> 01:07:10.020]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can, too, with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:14.023]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[01:07:14.244 --> 01:07:19.248]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[01:07:19.528 --> 01:07:24.031]  ARC's big 40-packet collection is loaded with everything a well-rounded garden should have.
[01:07:24.231 --> 01:07:28.293]  There's heirloom sweet corn, melons, squash, and tomatoes, enough to share with your neighbor.
[01:07:28.373 --> 01:07:35.497]  There's cabbage, beans, peas, lettuce and carrots, beets, onions, cucumbers, eggplant, radishes, many other garden favorites, even popcorn.
[01:07:35.797 --> 01:07:36.357]  Save money.

[01:07:37.337 --> 01:07:41.259]  Grow your own delicious, secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.

[01:07:42.999 --> 01:07:44.260]  That's 1-800-255-1912 or visit arcinstitute.com today.
[01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:45.580]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:46.980]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:04.852]  Eight minutes, ten seconds into this second hour.
[01:08:04.892 --> 01:08:11.497]  Let me just go through some police state news here quickly, then we'll go on to all of the folks that are patiently holding.
[01:08:12.138 --> 01:08:16.801]  CBS News reporting, cops count on pizza tattletales.
[01:08:18.142 --> 01:08:22.205]  The long arm of the law may be ringing your doorbell and holding a pizza.
[01:08:22.445 --> 01:08:27.229]  Police in Portsmouth hope to enlist pizza delivery people and hotel clerks.
[01:08:28.452 --> 01:08:32.253]  Help cut into underage drinking and parents who allow it.
[01:08:33.293 --> 01:08:39.375]  Some cities out in New Mexico, your 20-year-old son, while you're gone, has a beer party.
[01:08:39.415 --> 01:08:40.475]  They take your house.
[01:08:40.975 --> 01:08:44.656]  And you can't have a trial because it's a civil city ordinance policy.
[01:08:45.376 --> 01:08:51.658]  Under a new law, it's illegal to the owner or occupants of a home or hotel when they have asset forfeiture or seizure.
[01:08:52.418 --> 01:08:56.339]  Room to host a gathering of five or more minors who are drinking or using drugs.
[01:08:57.017 --> 01:08:59.558]  We ought to stop those drugs, but we need to put them on Ritalin and Prozac.
[01:09:00.038 --> 01:09:02.979]  Teens as young as 17 who throw a party could be tried as adults.
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:09.422]  Portsmouth Police Sergeant Mike Schwartz, this is going on coast to coast, said the program is called the Booze Bouncy.
[01:09:09.922 --> 01:09:16.765]  He said food delivery people and hotel clerks receive $50 if their anonymous tips of suspicious activity lead to arrest or party host.
[01:09:17.545 --> 01:09:18.906]  And they get to grab the hotel, too.
[01:09:19.566 --> 01:09:20.387]  You won't have a job.
[01:09:20.987 --> 01:09:23.808]  The message being, and they've done this, by the way, even in Houston,
[01:09:24.603 --> 01:09:37.336]  The message being sent to parents is that it's not safe for them to host a party, said Jackie Valley of the Community Division Program in Greenland, which works to keep at-risk youths out of trouble with the law.
[01:09:37.436 --> 01:09:42.020]  This doesn't change the fact that youths usually using alcohol is still illegal.
[01:09:43.381 --> 01:09:45.764]  And remember a few weeks ago, USA Today...
[01:09:46.976 --> 01:09:53.740]  Said that the headline was, pizza delivery will catch the scoff laws, people that ignore the law.
[01:09:54.201 --> 01:09:59.704]  And when you order a pizza, and maybe they've lost your address or you've moved, the feds or city or county can't grab you.
[01:10:00.044 --> 01:10:02.946]  When you order a pizza, it goes through a database and shows where you're at.
[01:10:02.986 --> 01:10:05.187]  Instead of a pizza, you get police.
[01:10:05.387 --> 01:10:06.348]  So this is your freedom.
[01:10:06.808 --> 01:10:08.229]  Guilty until proven innocent.
[01:10:08.729 --> 01:10:09.810]  Being spied on.
[01:10:10.370 --> 01:10:13.372]  The cable guy, the carpet cleaner lady.
[01:10:14.018 --> 01:10:18.750]  I mean, I had a carpet cleaner asking about a shotgun in my house once.
[01:10:19.637 --> 01:10:21.098]  Is that shotgun legal?
[01:10:21.238 --> 01:10:21.838]  Well, of course.
[01:10:21.918 --> 01:10:23.259]  You can buy it at the store down the street.
[01:10:23.699 --> 01:10:29.302]  Well, and luckily I called the carpet cleaner outfit, and the owner said, no, no, you're allowed to have shotguns.
[01:10:29.322 --> 01:10:32.784]  But there has been a discussion of calling the police on me.
[01:10:33.244 --> 01:10:40.868]  Why, I have a shotgun that I bought at the sporting goods store a decade ago that any of you can buy for $300.
[01:10:41.208 --> 01:10:42.709]  Oh, I'm evil.
[01:10:42.869 --> 01:10:45.070]  I need to maybe have the police called on me.
[01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:48.452]  You're starting to get the freedom of the new homeland?
[01:10:49.531 --> 01:10:50.772]  And here's Newsweek.
[01:10:51.412 --> 01:10:53.033]  It says, The future of shopping.
[01:10:53.333 --> 01:11:00.036]  Oh, tiny silicon identity chips being put into everyday objects and even implanted under the skin are changing the way we consume.
[01:11:00.056 --> 01:11:03.978]  And this is the June 17th, 14th issue.
[01:11:04.159 --> 01:11:08.961]  Antonio Haslar has a chip in his shoulder, or rather just beneath the skin of his left arm.
[01:11:09.381 --> 01:11:14.364]  It's a piece of silicon the size of a grain of rice, and it emits wireless signals that are picked up by scanners.
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:23.095]  Even ever since the 34-year-old website producer had the chip implanted in his arm, he's enjoyed VIP status at Barcelona's Baja Beach Club.
[01:11:23.897 --> 01:11:27.564]  And we've had on, before anybody else, what, about two months ago,
[01:11:28.653 --> 01:11:35.018]  We had the Baja Beach Club supplier of Applied Digital, and he said, oh, everyone's going to have to have it to buy and sell.
[01:11:35.398 --> 01:11:37.640]  We're about to make the entire Italian government take it.
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:38.821]  The police are going to have to have it.
[01:11:39.141 --> 01:11:44.304]  And in the last two months, it's been in the Associated Press, you name it, and here it is in Newsweek.
[01:11:46.266 --> 01:11:51.950]  Ever since the 34-year-old website producer had the chip and plant in his arm, he's enjoyed VIP status at Barcelona's Baja Beach Club.
[01:11:52.270 --> 01:11:57.454]  Instead of quelling up behind velvet ropes,
[01:11:58.183 --> 01:12:01.484]  He allows the bouncer to scan his arm and strolls right in.
[01:12:01.544 --> 01:12:07.866]  If he wants a drink, the bartender waves an electronic wand and deducts it from the 100 euro tab on his chip.
[01:12:08.547 --> 01:12:16.269]  Such sci-fi clothing is made possible by radio frequency identification, or RFID, tiny digital chips that broadcast wireless signals.
[01:12:16.909 --> 01:12:20.050]  And then it goes on to say that you're not going to have this for money anymore.
[01:12:20.230 --> 01:12:22.671]  Every product is going to have it by next year.
[01:12:23.171 --> 01:12:25.812]  Walmart tried to do it last year, but people protested.
[01:12:26.693 --> 01:12:27.613]  On and on and on.
[01:12:29.634 --> 01:12:36.338]  And it can be used for troublemakers, for prisoners, for old people.
[01:12:36.398 --> 01:12:37.419]  It's just so good.
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:40.020]  Here's another one.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:50.227]  The New York Times reported in a huge article that was buried in there that they're going to have little scanning cameras buried in the concrete.
[01:12:50.247 --> 01:12:51.707]  In fact, they're already out there.
[01:12:53.288 --> 01:12:59.132]  And it says that they're going to scan and see if your tires are too bald, and they'll go ahead and call the police on you.
[01:13:00.043 --> 01:13:03.046]  Or if you're driving erratically, they're going to go ahead and call the police on you.
[01:13:03.807 --> 01:13:07.631]  Cameras embedded in pavement, markings used in the U.S.
[01:13:07.671 --> 01:13:09.774]  for the past three years is the headline.
[01:13:10.735 --> 01:13:12.676]  This is unreported.com.
[01:13:12.816 --> 01:13:14.476]  Went and grabbed this out of the New York Times.
[01:13:14.796 --> 01:13:18.818]  There's an interesting twist I discovered, a story that's going around the blogs.
[01:13:18.858 --> 01:13:27.180]  The story is about cameras embedded in flush-mounted dots in the road, according to the May 13, 2004 New York Times article.
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:36.663]  Now, after perfecting illuminated markers that are embedded in the road surface to guide motorists through bad weather or warn of dangerous conditions, Mr. Dick's company...
[01:13:37.822 --> 01:13:38.783]  We're good to go.
[01:13:57.436 --> 01:14:04.519]  The cameras, the system can be used, either normal or infrared sensors, provide remarkably detailed images, according to Mr. Dix.
[01:14:04.879 --> 01:14:09.842]  Quote, you can clearly see everything underneath a vehicle, although I'm not sure why you'd want to do that, he said.
[01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:17.205]  The police, however, are likely to be interested in seeing the license patches, plates of vehicles traveling above the speed limit or through red lights.
[01:14:17.565 --> 01:14:25.869]  To that end, the company has developed a system that is operating on highways in Scotland and employs three embedded cameras to give front, rear, and side views of the passing vehicle.
[01:14:26.588 --> 01:14:37.194]  Other embedded sensors project two infrared beams on the road that are used to time traffic and determine its speed, the images and the speed data travel under the road by cable or computer.
[01:14:37.594 --> 01:14:38.935]  And I've seen them all over the country.
[01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:45.059]  I've walked up on the side of the road as they're cutting these splotches into the road, putting in the cameras, laying the cable.
[01:14:46.359 --> 01:14:56.105]  On a trip last year to Kansas City from Austin, I saw them at four separate areas from Texas to Oklahoma into Missouri putting these in.
[01:14:57.143 --> 01:14:59.585]  I'll get more into that a little bit later.
[01:14:59.605 --> 01:15:04.648]  I've got some other articles here that I want to get to after we take some calls.
[01:15:04.668 --> 01:15:13.795]  A nine-year-old girl subdued with a stun gun after being handcuffed by South Tucson police is among a growing group nationally of children who have the device used on them.
[01:15:15.376 --> 01:15:16.897]  And it said that she hadn't done anything.
[01:15:16.937 --> 01:15:19.539]  They just put her in handcuffs and decided to go ahead and taser her.
[01:15:22.219 --> 01:15:25.460]  And it's right there in the town in the last six months.
[01:15:25.540 --> 01:15:27.240]  This is in Arizona, Tucson.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:30.641]  Ten children, seven and younger, have been hit with tasers.
[01:15:30.721 --> 01:15:39.903]  Some were as young as one-year-old, but most of the toddlers... Okay, all right.
[01:15:40.143 --> 01:15:40.883]  I'm an extremist.
[01:15:40.923 --> 01:15:43.883]  I'm against tasering one-year-olds.
[01:15:45.424 --> 01:15:49.965]  I thought it was about a month ago we talked to the 95-year-old lady and her 76-year-old daughter.
[01:15:50.645 --> 01:15:51.345]  Blind women?
[01:15:52.997 --> 01:15:54.097]  Tasered five times?
[01:15:55.018 --> 01:15:55.578]  I'm sorry.
[01:15:56.478 --> 01:15:57.719]  Tasering one-year-olds.
[01:15:59.119 --> 01:16:00.559]  This is KVOA news.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:02.960]  And they go on to say it's good.
[01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:03.560]  Okay.
[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:04.921]  Here's another one.
[01:16:05.821 --> 01:16:06.981]  They don't say it's good here.
[01:16:07.001 --> 01:16:08.042]  This is out of Roanoke.
[01:16:09.522 --> 01:16:15.964]  And it says, about to tort resource officer, loses job of residence at the end of the class May 17th.
[01:16:15.984 --> 01:16:21.766]  The boy tried to hug the officer, but she took him to the ground, the school principal said.
[01:16:22.995 --> 01:16:27.800]  The county resource officer responded to a fifth grader's affection in a defensive manner, lost her job.
[01:16:28.461 --> 01:16:33.427]  The county sheriff's Ronnie Sprinkles said he terminated deputy C.J.
[01:16:33.487 --> 01:16:38.833]  Dickerson, she'll be hired by the feds, on Monday for inappropriate bullying a student by taking him to the ground.
[01:16:39.588 --> 01:16:41.189]  At Colonial Elementary School!
[01:17:12.398 --> 01:17:12.938]  I'm sorry.
[01:17:13.478 --> 01:17:15.139]  Tazering one-year-olds.
[01:17:16.900 --> 01:17:21.001]  Okay, let's... I don't have words anymore, people.
[01:17:22.761 --> 01:17:24.842]  We're all going to have microchips to buy and sell.
[01:17:24.922 --> 01:17:26.183]  Tazering one-year-olds.
[01:17:26.463 --> 01:17:28.083]  Tazering 95-year-old women.
[01:17:28.884 --> 01:17:31.925]  Let's go ahead and talk to Shazam in Colorado.
[01:17:32.205 --> 01:17:33.065]  Go ahead, Shazam.
[01:17:33.860 --> 01:17:34.481]  Hi, Alex.
[01:17:34.901 --> 01:17:42.567]  For a few months, I've been sure about what's going to go on at the G8 meeting, and that was a month before I found out there was a G8 meeting next week.
[01:17:43.168 --> 01:17:49.893]  What's going to happen is Boyd George and some of his dogs are going to be arrested, and John Dennis Hastert is going to be installed as president.
[01:17:51.354 --> 01:18:01.583]  What set me off to this is mid-summer of 2002, Hastert recused himself to secession to the presidency, and then about six weeks later, he recanted that.
[01:18:02.481 --> 01:18:04.782]  Well, Hastert is a Bilderberg group member.
[01:18:04.802 --> 01:18:05.842]  They're all in the same group.
[01:18:05.942 --> 01:18:08.822]  Yeah, this is well planned.
[01:18:09.943 --> 01:18:13.403]  What I think the boy is going to get arrested for is the wrong thing.
[01:18:13.463 --> 01:18:17.544]  You know how well staged all this war crime stuff is in Iraq.
[01:18:18.204 --> 01:18:21.505]  I think the real tyranny is going on in Afghanistan.
[01:18:21.545 --> 01:18:26.066]  When we start hearing the words Enron, UNICAL, and Afghanistan in the same sentence,
[01:18:26.963 --> 01:18:28.785]  That's where we're going to find the real charity.
[01:18:28.805 --> 01:18:29.725]  Well, sir, I have to be honest.
[01:18:29.805 --> 01:18:30.906]  I totally disagree with you.
[01:18:30.926 --> 01:18:35.750]  I mean, Bush is following orders, making America take the blame for all of this, for the bigger empire in Europe.
[01:18:35.851 --> 01:18:40.534]  And, you know, to say he's going to be arrested at the GH Summit, I mean, where do you come up with that?
[01:18:41.075 --> 01:18:41.876]  I'm an astrologer.
[01:18:43.497 --> 01:18:50.102]  Okay, well, why don't you call me back next week, okay, when it doesn't... I mean, so your astrology tells you he's going to be arrested?
[01:18:50.283 --> 01:18:52.364]  That's correct, and Hastert's going to be present.
[01:18:52.524 --> 01:18:54.086]  The boy is not going to finish his term.
[01:18:55.922 --> 01:18:57.243]  He is not going to finish his term.
[01:18:57.503 --> 01:18:58.824]  And who's going to arrest Bush?
[01:18:59.544 --> 01:19:04.927]  You know, it's either going to be our military or, heaven forbid, it could be like international UN people.
[01:19:04.967 --> 01:19:06.448]  But look at the build-up down there.
[01:19:07.808 --> 01:19:08.489]  Look at the build-up.
[01:19:08.609 --> 01:19:12.531]  On your Friday show, somebody said that they couldn't get by Jekyll Island to go fishing.
[01:19:13.251 --> 01:19:14.332]  Because there's military there.
[01:19:14.352 --> 01:19:17.053]  This is all coming together.
[01:19:17.113 --> 01:19:19.695]  The martial law in Georgia, it's all being pressed.
[01:19:19.715 --> 01:19:21.556]  Well, it is martial law in Georgia.
[01:19:21.916 --> 01:19:23.657]  Okay, well, I tell you what...
[01:19:25.029 --> 01:19:28.670]  I'll call you back, and I hope you don't put me on hold next week after the boy's arrested.
[01:19:29.490 --> 01:19:30.490]  Oh, no, sir.
[01:19:30.650 --> 01:19:36.251]  We will fly you here in style if that's really what happens.
[01:19:37.131 --> 01:19:38.551]  Okay, thanks for the call.
[01:19:39.892 --> 01:19:41.492]  We're not going to arrest Lord Bush.
[01:19:42.112 --> 01:19:43.612]  He's done the job for him.
[01:19:44.112 --> 01:19:44.553]  Come on.
[01:19:46.873 --> 01:19:47.473]  Oh, amazing.
[01:19:47.493 --> 01:19:49.273]  I think your planets are out of the line there, sir.
[01:19:50.114 --> 01:19:51.174]  We'll be right back with your calls.
[01:19:51.194 --> 01:19:52.414]  We'll tell you about the martial law, too.
[01:19:55.037 --> 01:19:59.541]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:19:59.881 --> 01:20:03.985]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:20:04.265 --> 01:20:04.825]  We listened.
[01:20:05.126 --> 01:20:10.110]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:20:10.390 --> 01:20:10.870]  We listened.
[01:20:11.251 --> 01:20:14.293]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:20:14.734 --> 01:20:15.274]  We listened.
[01:20:15.715 --> 01:20:19.758]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:20:20.158 --> 01:20:20.639]  We listened.
[01:20:20.979 --> 01:20:26.225]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:20:26.645 --> 01:20:28.007]  Again, we listened.
[01:20:28.367 --> 01:20:35.755]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:20:36.135 --> 01:20:39.179]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter for only $259.

[01:21:18.396 --> 01:21:22.238]  Now you can grow twice as much in half the space without mess or back-breaking work.
[01:21:22.418 --> 01:21:23.279]  Think smart garden.
[01:21:23.319 --> 01:21:23.519]  That's 888-338-3305.

[01:22:49.642 --> 01:22:51.628]  Thanks for watching!
[01:22:53.695 --> 01:22:57.258]  Can you grow your own nutrition on a shelf indoors in 10 days?
[01:22:57.578 --> 01:22:57.898]  Yes.
[01:22:58.198 --> 01:23:03.002]  Wheatgrass juice is live superfood, the richest nutritional liquid known to man.
[01:23:03.122 --> 01:23:12.048]  Packed with amino acids, living enzymes, and over 100 elements, two ounces of juice have the same nutrition as three pounds of choice garden produce.
[01:23:12.208 --> 01:23:19.913]  The get-up-and-go energy, healing, blood-building, weight control, and cleansing are just the beginnings of what you will reap from pennies worth of grain.
[01:23:20.133 --> 01:23:22.355]  Hi, I'm Alan Davison at Monocot Wheatgrass.
[01:23:22.415 --> 01:23:22.655]  I think.
[01:23:59.055 --> 01:24:15.463]  You know, we have this article out of Roanoke where the elementary school student tries to hug the secret police commissar trainer.
[01:24:16.283 --> 01:24:19.885]  And she grabs him by the arm, almost dislocates his arm, slams him down.
[01:24:21.405 --> 01:24:22.126]  And they fired her.
[01:24:22.386 --> 01:24:29.150]  No criminal charges have been filed, but the action constitutes a misdemeanor and charges would have to be made by the individuals involved.
[01:24:31.291 --> 01:24:32.952]  But at least they're firing her.
[01:24:33.093 --> 01:24:50.744]  But not in Arizona, where in just a few month period, they tasered children as... It says records show that as of six months ago, ten children, seven as young...
[01:24:52.416 --> 01:24:54.037]  Seven and younger have been hit with tasers.
[01:24:54.097 --> 01:24:55.758]  Some were as young as one year old.
[01:24:57.359 --> 01:25:07.466]  Again, nine-year-old girl subdued with a stun gun after being handcuffed by South Tucson police is among a growing group of children who have had the devices used on them.
[01:25:07.546 --> 01:25:11.309]  I mean, what is going on here?
[01:25:12.070 --> 01:25:13.751]  What happened to your brains?
[01:25:14.351 --> 01:25:16.313]  I guess we're just the enemy and have got to be stopped.
[01:25:17.754 --> 01:25:20.716]  At least it's better than Iraq where they use lead on the children.
[01:25:21.631 --> 01:25:23.632]  But I guess that's part of fighting Al-Qaeda, too.
[01:25:24.473 --> 01:25:28.435]  We're about to go to J.R., but he just hung up, so let's go to Louis in Pennsylvania.
[01:25:28.475 --> 01:25:29.255]  Louis, go ahead.
[01:25:29.275 --> 01:25:30.436]  Hi, Alex.
[01:25:30.476 --> 01:25:31.016]  How you doing?
[01:25:31.436 --> 01:25:32.357]  Well, I'm a radical.
[01:25:32.457 --> 01:25:34.658]  I think tasering one-year-olds is wrong.
[01:25:34.678 --> 01:25:36.419]  I think it's sickening.
[01:25:37.639 --> 01:25:47.024]  But the reason why I called you is a couple years ago, I called you and I told you that I found an old war manual dated back to 1937.
[01:25:47.164 --> 01:25:47.885]  And this war manual...
[01:25:51.232 --> 01:25:56.755]  Had a map and it talked about we would have to accept federal world government.
[01:25:57.876 --> 01:26:08.822]  Well, I pondered on this for a while and I got referring back to it in my research and I came across an old book written in the 1950s and in this had documents.
[01:26:08.842 --> 01:26:09.763]  It was called U.S.
[01:26:09.783 --> 01:26:12.385]  History Documents and it had the U.N.
[01:26:12.405 --> 01:26:18.008]  Charter in there and I started reading it and I got a clear picture of what
[01:26:18.854 --> 01:26:19.494]  What's happening?
[01:26:19.874 --> 01:26:26.497]  Hey, I have the New York Times from the late 1930s with a map of the country in ten regions and world government.
[01:26:26.537 --> 01:26:28.858]  Yeah, I mean, this is an old program.
[01:26:28.878 --> 01:26:31.439]  They tried it with the League of Nations in 1918.
[01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:36.761]  But now it's coming to fruition using terror as the pretext.
[01:26:36.921 --> 01:26:39.522]  Well, I got a bombshell I'm going to drop on your show today.
[01:26:40.522 --> 01:26:44.604]  And I hope all your listeners have got one hand on their gun and one hand on their food.
[01:26:45.424 --> 01:26:47.425]  Because I finally put the puzzle together.
[01:26:48.479 --> 01:26:55.766]  You see, when they built the United Nations in the 40s, they had already laid out the blue plant during the 1800s.
[01:26:55.986 --> 01:26:59.149]  Not the 1930s, the 1800s.
[01:27:00.190 --> 01:27:13.563]  When Roosevelt gave his famous speech, The Four Freedoms of Want, or The Four Freedoms, The Freedom of Want, The Freedom of Fear, The Freedom of Religion, the media blacked some of that out.
[01:27:15.262 --> 01:27:16.262]  It was about the world.
[01:27:16.322 --> 01:27:18.043]  It wasn't about just this country.
[01:27:18.103 --> 01:27:19.164]  It was about the world.
[01:27:19.804 --> 01:27:22.825]  They had already been practicing world government.
[01:27:22.845 --> 01:27:24.046]  Well, yeah, the British Empire.
[01:27:24.766 --> 01:27:25.106]  Okay.
[01:27:25.606 --> 01:27:26.307]  Well, here's the thing.
[01:27:26.367 --> 01:27:39.172]  When they built the United Nations and they brought the five superpowers together, our president at the time, Roosevelt, had declared us the official policemen of the world.
[01:27:40.146 --> 01:27:42.428]  This is why we see all this police action going on.
[01:27:42.448 --> 01:27:43.709]  They didn't build the U.N.
[01:27:44.389 --> 01:27:48.472]  They set it up in 45 and built it in the early 50s, sir.
[01:27:50.193 --> 01:27:54.616]  If you go back... No, I know they already had the world government bodies set up.
[01:27:55.577 --> 01:27:56.638]  But here's the thing.
[01:27:57.398 --> 01:27:58.139]  Here's the thing.
[01:27:58.179 --> 01:27:59.120]  Here's the bombshell.
[01:27:59.820 --> 01:28:00.100]  Okay?
[01:28:00.881 --> 01:28:04.964]  And don't take this wrong, Alex, because believe me, I respect everything you do.
[01:28:05.104 --> 01:28:05.604]  That's fine.
[01:28:05.644 --> 01:28:06.045]  Go ahead.
[01:28:06.125 --> 01:28:06.685]  Go ahead, sir.
[01:28:07.085 --> 01:28:07.926]  Here's the bombshell.
[01:28:08.991 --> 01:28:11.252]  World government isn't coming, and neither is the New World Order.
[01:28:11.492 --> 01:28:12.192]  It's not coming.
[01:28:12.693 --> 01:28:13.773]  It's already here.
[01:28:14.433 --> 01:28:15.474]  Well, I've always said that.
[01:28:15.514 --> 01:28:20.996]  I mean, we're inside the New World Order, but it's like being a frog in a pot on top of the stove.
[01:28:21.096 --> 01:28:26.319]  It's what level of boiling do we have?
[01:28:26.339 --> 01:28:31.801]  Is it set on center, or is it set on five, or is it set on maximum?
[01:28:32.422 --> 01:28:34.663]  And they're now turning the dial up to maximum.
[01:28:34.703 --> 01:28:35.303]  Thanks for the call.
[01:28:35.990 --> 01:28:36.710]  Good to hear from you.
[01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:39.071]  Yeah, you can read all those old public documents.
[01:28:39.111 --> 01:28:42.793]  I mean, government publications calling for world government.
[01:28:44.474 --> 01:28:50.276]  Let's go ahead and talk to, up next is Tim in Colorado.
[01:28:50.316 --> 01:28:50.976]  Tim, go ahead.
[01:28:50.996 --> 01:28:52.097]  Hello.
[01:28:52.197 --> 01:29:03.842]  I'm a general contractor here in Colorado, and I'm building this house in an upper-end neighborhood, and I guess one of the neighbors had a problem with me.
[01:29:04.392 --> 01:29:08.494]  And they started out with intimidation and stuff like that, which is no big deal, and that wasn't working.
[01:29:09.215 --> 01:29:12.857]  Then they started breaking into my house, and this is like police protected.
[01:29:13.517 --> 01:29:14.938]  One guy was caught in my house.
[01:29:14.978 --> 01:29:16.799]  He was given a ticket.
[01:29:17.420 --> 01:29:25.684]  All three witnesses saw him in there, went to court, and said, I need to be here because it was already dropped.
[01:29:25.804 --> 01:29:26.985]  And so what's the point?
[01:29:27.645 --> 01:29:33.269]  Well, the point is I'm kind of being pushed out of the neighborhood here, and now I was just...
[01:29:34.225 --> 01:29:36.688]  Four cop cars surrounded me around my house.
[01:29:37.209 --> 01:29:39.071]  I'm not doing anything.
[01:29:39.311 --> 01:29:40.292]  Stay there.
[01:29:40.472 --> 01:29:41.253]  We'll be right back.
[01:29:44.096 --> 01:29:45.017]  We're on the march.
[01:29:45.498 --> 01:29:47.100]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:50.704]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:29:54.255 --> 01:29:55.856]  Hello folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:29:55.996 --> 01:30:00.118]  You know Berkey water filters have been removing pathogenic bacteria for years.
[01:30:00.238 --> 01:30:03.099]  But what about those unhealthy chemicals and heavy metals in your water?
[01:30:03.199 --> 01:30:09.923]  The powerful black Berkey purification elements fit most gravity filters and dramatically increase their power to extract waterborne contaminants.
[01:30:10.103 --> 01:30:13.104]  Best of all, they filter much faster than ordinary gravity elements.
[01:30:13.304 --> 01:30:15.706]  This means it takes much less time to filter your water.
[01:30:15.826 --> 01:30:20.548]  Black Berkey elements not only remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, and parasites, but also remove...
[01:30:20.728 --> 01:30:35.298]  Try halomethanes and volatile organic elements such as aprazine, benzene, chloride, and chloroform, MTBE, radon-222, foul taste and obnoxious odors like sulfur, even nitrates, and unwanted heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and aluminum are extracted.
[01:30:35.458 --> 01:30:42.143]  Supercharge your gravity filter today and order a two-pack of Black Berkey Purification Elements for only $96 or a four-pack for only $175 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:30:45.526 --> 01:30:47.330]  That's 888-803-4438 or order on the web at BerkeyWater.com.
[01:30:53.869 --> 01:30:56.231]  So what's in your shampoo, bath soap, and dish soap?
[01:30:56.491 --> 01:31:00.334]  Chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodiums, formaldehydes, etc.
[01:31:00.654 --> 01:31:01.455]  Read the labels.
[01:31:01.895 --> 01:31:06.018]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:31:06.238 --> 01:31:10.421]  Also may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.
[01:31:10.801 --> 01:31:15.685]  Perfumes, also known as fragrance on a label, can indicate the presence of thousands of separate ingredients.
[01:31:16.065 --> 01:31:19.607]  Now just by one example, here's what's in my Cal-Ben Pure Soap Shampoo.
[01:31:19.827 --> 01:31:25.170]  It's all natural, earth-friendly, it contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oils.
[01:31:25.450 --> 01:31:28.171]  No harsh chemicals, no animal tallow or testing.
[01:31:28.472 --> 01:31:29.372]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:31:29.672 --> 01:31:40.398]  Call now, 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all their cleaning products with Cal-Ben Pure Soaps.

[01:31:53.462 --> 01:31:55.884]  Two nuclear powers rattle sabers over a disputed area.
[01:31:56.264 --> 01:32:00.167]  Peace in the Middle East derailed again as another wave of suicide bombers destabilized the region.
[01:32:00.567 --> 01:32:03.209]  Here at home, and abroad, our own war against terror continues.
[01:32:03.510 --> 01:32:04.170]  Important news.
[01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:06.972]  The news you need is sketchy at best when it comes to the mainstream press.
[01:32:07.312 --> 01:32:13.057]  With Grundig's Yacht Boy 400 PE World Band Shortwave Radio, world news, news that affects you, will be at your fingertips.
[01:32:13.417 --> 01:32:17.340]  The Yacht Boy 400 PE is rated as the number one portable shortwave radio in the industry.
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:26.410]  And for no small reason when you consider ease of operation and features like over 40 station presets, both upper and lower sidebands, as well as ship-to-shore weather and aviation bands.
[01:32:26.570 --> 01:32:32.297]  The Grundig Yacht-Boy 400 PE is fully digital, comes with its own carrying case, external antenna, and a headset for private listening.
[01:33:04.999 --> 01:33:07.281]  Jim had just called from Colorado.
[01:33:08.301 --> 01:33:11.043]  He's having some type of police state problem.
[01:33:13.045 --> 01:33:17.408]  And yeah, getting in bad with your neighbors or having them not like you can turn into quite a nightmare.
[01:33:17.428 --> 01:33:19.970]  They've made a lot of different movies and sitcoms about that.
[01:33:21.151 --> 01:33:23.672]  But if you can get back in, sir, I wanted to talk to you more.
[01:33:23.712 --> 01:33:24.773]  I wasn't hanging up on you.
[01:33:24.813 --> 01:33:25.594]  We had to go to break.
[01:33:27.236 --> 01:33:31.498]  We're going to go to Michael and Ken and Al and others here in a few minutes.
[01:33:31.518 --> 01:33:38.321]  We're going to have Paul Watson with us for the balance of the broadcast in the next hour and 26 minutes to go over all the news we haven't covered yet.
[01:33:39.201 --> 01:33:40.882]  I want to get into this article.
[01:33:41.102 --> 01:33:46.224]  Actions indicate administration has plans to reinstate military draft after the election.
[01:33:46.464 --> 01:33:47.985]  Doesn't matter really who gets elected.
[01:33:48.805 --> 01:33:51.406]  New York Times calling for a national ID card.
[01:33:51.446 --> 01:33:52.727]  We already have one, folks.
[01:33:53.407 --> 01:33:56.048]  Smart Bullet reports back wirelessly.
[01:33:57.756 --> 01:34:00.857]  Subway workers, locator chips create stir.
[01:34:00.877 --> 01:34:02.777]  Oh, yes.
[01:34:03.178 --> 01:34:07.139]  And we're going to get into the stuff that's the latest developments in Iraq.
[01:34:07.239 --> 01:34:11.280]  I want to go first, though, into martial law in Georgia.
[01:34:11.360 --> 01:34:16.441]  We had the head legal counsel for the ACLU of Georgia on in the last hour.
[01:34:16.821 --> 01:34:18.221]  He called it martial law.
[01:34:19.162 --> 01:34:20.602]  It is martial law.
[01:34:22.109 --> 01:34:30.779]  And 20,000 police, the military, all of it for this G8 summit, and they're using terror as the pretext to totally enslave us.
[01:34:31.660 --> 01:34:40.510]  We also have Gary Hart, John Kerry, George Bush, John Ashcroft out fear-mongering saying terrorists are going to hit us, give up all your freedoms.
[01:34:40.951 --> 01:34:42.633]  This is so transparent.
[01:34:43.490 --> 01:34:46.371]  But the gullible mass out there doesn't want to face the facts.
[01:34:46.911 --> 01:34:53.194]  Paul Joseph Watson, webmaster for my websites prisonplanet.tv and prisonplanet.com.
[01:34:53.214 --> 01:34:54.694]  We also have infowars.com.
[01:34:55.475 --> 01:34:57.115]  Paul, good to have you on with us today.
[01:34:57.615 --> 01:34:58.516]  Good to be back, Alex.
[01:34:59.436 --> 01:35:09.160]  So much is happening, but I want to get your response, your analysis of the G8 summit and admitting martial law, no protest in Georgia.
[01:35:10.290 --> 01:35:27.750]  Well, I mean, there's basically a new depth in the decline and eradication of free speech, and whether it's about state of emergencies or free speech zones, which is covered in the past, the goal is the same, prevent people from pointing out that the king has no clothes, and now
[01:35:28.610 --> 01:35:43.241]  It's common policy up and down the country for protesters to be videotaped, watched, put in databases before they do protest, you know, have to pay for the privilege, turning a right into a privilege, to protest in the first place.
[01:35:43.822 --> 01:35:48.906]  And in many cases, these videotapes are being held by military personnel.
[01:35:48.946 --> 01:35:50.767]  We've had the photos on the website before.
[01:35:52.489 --> 01:35:56.572]  I mean, here in Britain, the government's own report admitted that
[01:35:57.162 --> 01:36:13.699]  In nine out of ten cases of the new stop and search terrorism law, which they introduced again under a constant state of emergency, which Britain has been under since September 11th, they admitted that in nine out of ten cases it was used against peaceful protesters.
[01:36:14.401 --> 01:36:16.522]  And I mean, the tactics are the same.
[01:36:17.463 --> 01:36:21.785]  And it doesn't matter if you're a land rights group or a conservative, liberal group.
[01:36:22.305 --> 01:36:24.727]  It's about scaring you into submission.
[01:36:25.167 --> 01:36:27.088]  From Denver to Miami, they have U.S.
[01:36:27.148 --> 01:36:31.411]  military out openly beating people up, videotaping.
[01:36:31.931 --> 01:36:34.212]  And then now they just say, forget it, you can't protest.
[01:36:34.232 --> 01:36:37.474]  This is martial law for your safety in Georgia.
[01:36:38.843 --> 01:36:39.483]  Well, exactly.
[01:36:39.503 --> 01:36:44.024]  And see, so now it won't be a big deal when they say martial law nationwide.
[01:36:44.124 --> 01:36:46.885]  All the police are being trained how to carry this out.
[01:36:48.165 --> 01:36:58.607]  Well, yeah, they're being trained, and they're being trained currently with the use of non-lethal weapons, such as, you know, using wooden dowels to fire on protesters in Oakland.
[01:36:59.227 --> 01:37:02.028]  And, you know, in a few years' time, there'll be live rounds.
[01:37:02.128 --> 01:37:02.508]  But, I mean...
[01:37:03.736 --> 01:37:13.984]  What I see it leading up to, basically, is at least a Genoa 2001 type event where the protester was shot and then ran over twice.
[01:37:14.985 --> 01:37:16.446]  At least that type of event.
[01:37:16.506 --> 01:37:29.496]  But eventually, I mean, this is leading up to some kind of Tiananmen Square event where they set up a rigged bomb, you know, in the middle of a protest, blame it on the protesters, and then the military rolls in under this state of emergency.
[01:37:29.716 --> 01:37:34.580]  Well, minus tanks running over people, we have them, I mean, in Miami.
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.162]  Tens of thousands of police under federal control.
[01:37:37.682 --> 01:37:50.132]  And they got so vicious, the mistake they made was herding World War II vets down alleys, federal judges in plain clothes, AP reporters, and saying, you shouldn't protest, and then savagely breaking bones.
[01:37:50.692 --> 01:37:52.434]  And this has been in all the Miami papers.
[01:37:52.494 --> 01:38:01.383]  It's been in some of the national papers that, oh, the police just have been ordered by the military and the government to target, and they're even beating up federal judges now.
[01:38:02.164 --> 01:38:05.508]  I mean, folks, if a federal judge isn't safe, you're sure not.
[01:38:07.058 --> 01:38:21.566]  And that's because they're getting ready for things that are going to cause millions of people to protest when they take your pension funds, when they do all of this, and when they totally devalue the dollar, they want it set up and ready to kill anybody that goes out on the streets.
[01:38:22.346 --> 01:38:28.952]  Well, the mirror image is Russia, where now Putin's basically abolished any right to protest around government buildings or any type of state event.
[01:38:48.380 --> 01:38:58.544]  And two or three years ago there was this big shock and horror about the fact that there was a protest going on and one of the Russian police punched a baby in the face.
[01:38:58.844 --> 01:39:04.507]  And then just a year later after that in America, you know, they were tear gassing babies in the face.
[01:39:05.828 --> 01:39:14.991]  That was in Portland, under Bush's hotel, 3,000 people, school teachers, the news media all had their cameras, and the police yelled, attack the media first!
[01:39:15.691 --> 01:39:17.271]  They attack them, wouldn't let them exit.
[01:39:17.511 --> 01:39:20.292]  People with newborns in their arms would run up and say, let me leave.
[01:39:20.332 --> 01:39:26.614]  They'd say, shouldn't bring a baby, and put the nozzle on video, right in the baby's face, and point blank, attempted to kill it.
[01:39:26.974 --> 01:39:28.034]  The child almost died.
[01:39:28.294 --> 01:39:35.136]  I mean, these people, I just read out of the Tucson News here, mainstream media, read this again.
[01:39:36.528 --> 01:39:49.297]  It says, Taser International, the Scottsdale-based manufacturer of devices used on South Tucson girls, says tasers do not harm the children, harm children more than adults, and often result in less serious injuries.
[01:39:49.357 --> 01:39:59.184]  And it goes on to say, records kept show that in the last six months that ten children, seven and younger, have been hit with tasers.
[01:39:59.264 --> 01:40:01.465]  Some were as young as one year old, Paul.
[01:40:01.485 --> 01:40:03.667]  So now, I mean...
[01:40:06.275 --> 01:40:10.138]  Now they attack babies, these bastards, these scum of the earth.
[01:40:10.178 --> 01:40:10.658]  Go ahead.
[01:40:11.118 --> 01:40:15.962]  Well, yeah, it's about taking the most defenseless thing on earth and, you know, bringing it down to that level.
[01:40:16.002 --> 01:40:21.786]  But even back in Seattle in 99, in your police state videos, they round people up.
[01:40:22.552 --> 01:40:24.334]  Old women begging and being savagely stomped while handcuffed.
[01:40:39.534 --> 01:40:52.080]  In front of news cameras, they have been told, you go out and you do it, you let them know we're God, wearing black ski masks, covering up their badge numbers, stomping old ladies, breaking their collarbones.
[01:40:52.540 --> 01:40:54.281]  So now you can't say the Nazis were bad.
[01:40:54.321 --> 01:40:55.882]  You can't say Tiananmen Square was bad.
[01:40:55.902 --> 01:40:56.222]  Go ahead.
[01:40:58.536 --> 01:41:07.421]  They allow the media to do it, and they're ordered to target the media along with these black bloc anarchists that are all organized under the police, given protection.
[01:41:07.662 --> 01:41:10.323]  Housed in government buildings, we have video of all this.
[01:41:11.224 --> 01:41:20.009]  And over in Italy, the so-called black bloc anarchists, the bombs that were planted, it was later admitted that that was in collusion with the police.
[01:41:20.669 --> 01:41:26.413]  And it's designed to be a media spectacle, so it sends a message to everyone watching on, you know,
[01:41:27.097 --> 01:41:32.701]  CNN, Fox News, don't dare process the 60 wars that they've got planned because this is what will happen to you.
[01:41:33.902 --> 01:41:37.204]  Every time we mention Black Block, I get an email saying, don't blame black people.
[01:41:37.284 --> 01:41:38.765]  Explain what the Black Block is.
[01:41:38.825 --> 01:41:43.148]  Explain that 35 minutes of that two-hour, five-minute film, The Takeover.
[01:41:43.468 --> 01:41:46.230]  Explain, because that was the training op for the rest of the country.
[01:41:46.530 --> 01:41:48.031]  Explain what they'll see in that video.
[01:41:49.052 --> 01:41:51.713]  Well, they'll see the Black Block in Seattle in 99.
[01:41:53.078 --> 01:42:09.546]  Who, as the police are, some of them are ordered to, you know, stand off as they go downtown, smash windows, break things, and all the peaceful protesters who are, you know, basically remonstrating with these hooded thugs to stop doing this because it sends a bad message.
[01:42:09.566 --> 01:42:14.108]  And this is all being filmed by the media who can't explain what's going on.
[01:42:16.089 --> 01:42:29.421]  And the black block is obviously the anarchist portion, the green block is the environmentalist, and then you've got the red blocks, the socialists, so it's not black people, it's the anarchists, the hooded thugs which resemble very closely the police.
[01:42:29.901 --> 01:42:33.804]  That are supposed to be there to stop them, but in most cases are in fact helping them.
[01:42:33.984 --> 01:42:38.488]  And then it came out in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, and we have video of this, and it's all in the film.
[01:42:39.189 --> 01:42:41.310]  What did they... I mean, go to the timeline.
[01:42:41.410 --> 01:42:45.433]  First day, thugs break some stuff, hit some cops, cops go, we've been ordered not to touch them.
[01:42:45.714 --> 01:42:49.917]  Then they retire to a four-story building, have food and drinks supplied.
[01:42:50.137 --> 01:42:57.383]  The police guard them, and then are given the order to attack the 60,000 peaceful people, taking 500 of them to the Sandpoint FEMA camp.
[01:42:58.667 --> 01:43:01.788]  And then later on, the National Guard gets sent in.
[01:43:02.448 --> 01:43:03.369]  And that's what gets put on video.
[01:43:03.389 --> 01:43:05.349]  And then they say no protesting in the city.
[01:43:05.370 --> 01:43:07.650]  When we got video of the cops, they go, was this American?
[01:43:07.670 --> 01:43:09.671]  They go, no criticizing the government allowed.
[01:43:09.991 --> 01:43:13.412]  You saw what happened yesterday with the protesters.
[01:43:14.313 --> 01:43:15.333]  No protest allowed.
[01:43:16.654 --> 01:43:20.235]  Searching bags looking for buttons that say no WTO.
[01:43:21.886 --> 01:43:24.668]  And the point is that a lot of the police were against that.
[01:43:24.688 --> 01:43:30.212]  They were asking why they couldn't go and arrest these people, but the orders were coming directly from above.
[01:43:31.533 --> 01:43:35.016]  And Delta Force was commanding it all from the hotel roof.
[01:43:36.986 --> 01:43:43.488]  And again, I mean, over in Australia, they will shut down protest websites that are organising the protest weeks beforehand.
[01:43:44.008 --> 01:43:52.350]  They will make people pay, make people get permits, you know, which have to be acquired weeks before they can set up a protest in Australia.
[01:43:53.610 --> 01:44:03.592]  We've mentioned many times the bill in Oregon, 742, which would, you know, classify protesters as terrorists and put them in forced work camps.
[01:44:03.752 --> 01:44:06.313]  And that's in the bill, which almost got passed.
[01:44:09.130 --> 01:44:17.672]  Let's take a few calls, and I want to get into all this Iraq news and Gary Hart and Kerry and Ashcroft saying terrorists are about to get us.
[01:44:17.712 --> 01:44:18.632]  Give up all your rights.
[01:44:19.552 --> 01:44:20.893]  Michael in Rhode Island.
[01:44:20.953 --> 01:44:22.053]  Michael, thanks for holding.
[01:44:22.073 --> 01:44:22.773]  You're on the air.
[01:44:22.993 --> 01:44:23.753]  Yes, hello, Alex.
[01:44:23.993 --> 01:44:24.654]  It's me again.
[01:44:24.674 --> 01:44:25.774]  I haven't talked to you in a long time.
[01:44:25.794 --> 01:44:31.755]  Just want to let you know that I'm still casting out your videos and stuff and waking people up.
[01:44:32.055 --> 01:44:32.395]  Good.
[01:44:32.595 --> 01:44:35.076]  More and more people are waking up in this area, Little Rhode Island.
[01:44:35.666 --> 01:44:38.947]  Did it wake people up when your governor tried to declare martial law?
[01:44:39.228 --> 01:44:39.848]  Oh, yeah.
[01:44:39.988 --> 01:44:44.110]  It didn't take long for him to retract his statement that he never read the bill.
[01:44:44.650 --> 01:44:50.753]  I mean, look, we're all just calmly talking about martial law, forest labor camps.
[01:44:51.153 --> 01:44:51.553]  Go ahead.
[01:44:51.773 --> 01:44:56.335]  Yeah, I told everybody about the microchip population about six, seven years ago when I was a kook.
[01:44:56.975 --> 01:45:00.337]  Now that it's here, they're like, well, yeah, it's here, but what can you do about it?
[01:45:00.357 --> 01:45:01.858]  So just stand up to it.
[01:45:02.158 --> 01:45:02.698]  Don't be a wimp.
[01:45:03.482 --> 01:45:05.082]  I mean, we've got to go through it.
[01:45:05.322 --> 01:45:08.803]  Hey, look, all we're saying is we shouldn't be forced to take microchips.
[01:45:09.163 --> 01:45:11.064]  Tasering one-year-olds is wrong.
[01:45:11.424 --> 01:45:13.964]  Putting cancer viruses in the vaccines is wrong.
[01:45:14.144 --> 01:45:15.185]  They're giving us cancer, folks.
[01:45:15.205 --> 01:45:15.785]  It's documented.
[01:45:16.925 --> 01:45:18.665]  That's all we're saying.
[01:45:19.106 --> 01:45:20.646]  We're the normal people.
[01:45:21.046 --> 01:45:21.606]  That's right.
[01:45:21.786 --> 01:45:22.646]  We are the normal people.
[01:45:23.066 --> 01:45:27.908]  And I sent that video of the truancy of the schools.
[01:45:28.608 --> 01:45:28.828]  Yes.
[01:45:29.288 --> 01:45:29.968]  That's incredible.
[01:45:30.669 --> 01:45:35.090]  Oh, here in Austin, where if you're late to class three times, they put you on probation and start drug testing you?
[01:45:35.530 --> 01:45:36.670]  Yeah!
[01:45:36.710 --> 01:45:40.151]  I kind of wish I was young enough to be in school having the information that I have now.
[01:45:40.791 --> 01:45:41.991]  I would have a field day.
[01:45:42.151 --> 01:45:43.811]  I would make their life a living, you know?
[01:45:44.511 --> 01:45:46.012]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:45:46.032 --> 01:45:46.812]  I hear you, my friend.
[01:45:46.852 --> 01:45:47.372]  Anything else?
[01:45:47.912 --> 01:45:51.753]  I'm just wondering when we're going to get you to come up to Rhode Island here, Alex.
[01:45:51.793 --> 01:45:53.853]  We'd love to get you up here and have you speak.
[01:45:54.753 --> 01:45:56.073]  Probably no time soon.
[01:45:56.113 --> 01:45:57.354]  I'm so tied down here.
[01:45:57.754 --> 01:45:58.154]  Yeah, I know.
[01:45:58.194 --> 01:45:59.914]  How about you're going to be on George Norrie again shortly?
[01:46:00.487 --> 01:46:00.887]  I don't know.
[01:46:00.927 --> 01:46:03.250]  They've told me I'll be back, but I haven't gotten a call yet.
[01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:05.992]  Yeah, things are definitely going well.
[01:46:06.412 --> 01:46:09.955]  Jack Bloods is on two hours a day here now on Rhode Island.
[01:46:10.456 --> 01:46:10.816]  Good.
[01:46:11.036 --> 01:46:13.338]  Yeah, he's a great researcher and a great guy.
[01:46:13.639 --> 01:46:14.119]  He is.
[01:46:14.179 --> 01:46:15.200]  Thanks for the call.
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:17.002]  I appreciate it.
[01:46:17.662 --> 01:46:19.524]  Paul, any comments to the things he raised?
[01:46:20.725 --> 01:46:20.945]  No.
[01:46:21.245 --> 01:46:22.086]  Go to the next call.
[01:46:22.246 --> 01:46:24.628]  Okay, let's talk to Ken in California.
[01:46:24.668 --> 01:46:25.409]  Ken, go ahead.
[01:46:28.664 --> 01:46:28.984]  Oh, yes.
[01:46:29.264 --> 01:46:31.505]  The LAPD has a new policy.
[01:46:31.885 --> 01:46:46.071]  Anyone who has been convicted of a drug crime or has two drunk driving convictions, the LAPD, as of one month ago, is staking out people's homes at night, especially on a Friday or Saturday night, trying to entrap people when they drive into their driveway.
[01:46:46.191 --> 01:46:46.891]  Yeah, I saw that.
[01:46:47.452 --> 01:46:51.033]  This is disgusting, and it's absolutely unconstitutional.
[01:46:51.193 --> 01:46:54.814]  These people have paid their debt to society, and now they've got the police on their back.
[01:46:54.834 --> 01:46:56.075]  Wow.
[01:46:56.926 --> 01:46:57.266]  Horrible.
[01:46:57.566 --> 01:47:00.467]  Well, we've got the inmates running the asylum, my friend.
[01:47:00.487 --> 01:47:02.207]  Oh, man.
[01:47:03.027 --> 01:47:04.428]  Somebody's got to take this to court.
[01:47:06.328 --> 01:47:07.548]  That's basically what I have to say.
[01:47:07.728 --> 01:47:08.829]  All right, thank you, sir.
[01:47:10.369 --> 01:47:12.489]  Let's go ahead and talk to Al.
[01:47:12.869 --> 01:47:14.430]  Al, where are you calling us from?
[01:47:14.450 --> 01:47:17.130]  I'm calling from Rialto.
[01:47:18.071 --> 01:47:18.491]  Where, sir?
[01:47:18.871 --> 01:47:20.291]  I'm calling from Rialto, California.
[01:47:20.411 --> 01:47:21.051]  Okay, welcome.
[01:47:21.071 --> 01:47:21.451]  Go ahead.
[01:47:22.712 --> 01:47:24.712]  Are you familiar with the work of Dave Emery?
[01:47:25.894 --> 01:47:28.675]  Yeah, I am familiar with his work up in San Francisco.
[01:47:29.175 --> 01:47:30.935]  Yeah, the Underground Reich and all that.
[01:47:31.495 --> 01:47:38.477]  He seems to provide a more specific space to just exactly what the New World Order is.
[01:47:38.877 --> 01:47:47.960]  It seems, from what he's been talking about, it seems that it's basically pushed by Germany.
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:52.441]  Basically, German, European, mainland Europe dominated...
[01:47:54.119 --> 01:48:04.186]  Well, if you look at who owns Europe, it's the same people that own Britain that own us, and that is not a clear, full picture.
[01:48:18.892 --> 01:48:20.473]  It's a handful of families.
[01:48:45.754 --> 01:49:05.005]  And on a policy level, it's like a network of spiderwebs where they will have the chief head in each country, which is why you see both social, economic, governmental, you know, police policies, all identical, all passed at the same time within months of each other, in many cases with the same names.
[01:49:05.425 --> 01:49:10.568]  Yeah, the actual policies are going to be set in Italy by the Bilderberg Group in two days for the year.
[01:49:10.849 --> 01:49:14.991]  Then they're going to carry out the implementation at the G8 three days later.
[01:49:16.857 --> 01:49:21.359]  Yeah, what I was kind of thinking, I know he mentioned, he kind of touched on that.
[01:49:22.059 --> 01:49:34.365]  He seemed to be saying that basically British and American forces, they basically left themselves in there to keep Germany from rising again.
[01:49:36.654 --> 01:49:39.616]  Sir, I'm just telling you who owns the New World Order.
[01:49:39.917 --> 01:49:47.722]  And you do have the Crumps and others in Germany, but the main dominance is in England and in the Netherlands and in France.
[01:49:48.283 --> 01:49:51.265]  And these families are all intermarried.
[01:49:51.285 --> 01:49:53.527]  There's no more than about 18 different families.
[01:49:53.967 --> 01:49:57.810]  And it's just like in The Godfather when the crime bosses all meet around the table.
[01:49:58.130 --> 01:49:59.672]  That's a Bilderberg group meeting.
[01:49:59.992 --> 01:50:01.113]  And occasionally they have war...
[01:50:01.493 --> 01:50:07.638]  Occasionally, they have wars with each other, but I'm telling you, who owns the planet are these families.
[01:50:07.778 --> 01:50:11.161]  And there is no power shift between Europe and the U.S.
[01:50:11.821 --> 01:50:13.282]  and the Anglo-American establishment.
[01:50:13.302 --> 01:50:13.582]  Paul?
[01:50:13.783 --> 01:50:14.283]  One more thing.
[01:50:16.144 --> 01:50:16.745]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:50:17.706 --> 01:50:21.068]  Are you familiar with Chairman Skolnick?
[01:50:21.108 --> 01:50:21.969]  Yes.
[01:50:22.129 --> 01:50:29.575]  He basically said that the phrase we use, Homeland Security...
[01:50:30.327 --> 01:50:33.890]  It's basically... It's an exact translation from Fatherland Security.
[01:50:34.370 --> 01:50:39.414]  Yeah, he said it translates out to Gestapo, which is the acronym in German.
[01:50:41.155 --> 01:50:43.657]  That's very similar, but thank you for the call, sir.
[01:50:44.478 --> 01:50:46.540]  We'll come back and talk more about this.
[01:50:47.180 --> 01:50:52.044]  When we return, I'm just giving you the facts here of who owns the New World Order, and it's not Germany.
[01:50:55.532 --> 01:51:01.454]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[01:51:01.674 --> 01:51:03.935]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.
[01:51:04.135 --> 01:51:10.477]  We provide outstanding products like Esiac, colloidal silver 500 parts per million, olive leaf extract,
[01:51:10.817 --> 01:51:11.478]  We're good to go.
[01:51:40.336 --> 01:51:43.439]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[01:51:43.599 --> 01:51:49.584]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[01:51:53.147 --> 01:51:57.490]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:51:57.671 --> 01:52:02.134]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:52:02.254 --> 01:52:02.735]  There is a...
[01:52:04.005 --> 01:52:06.627]  To use this disaster as a new world order.
[01:52:06.707 --> 01:52:09.449]  A new world order can emerge.
[01:52:09.789 --> 01:52:13.992]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:52:14.072 --> 01:52:20.997]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:52:21.137 --> 01:52:23.139]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:52:23.359 --> 01:52:33.907]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:52:34.127 --> 01:52:39.511]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:52:40.012 --> 01:52:42.674]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:52:42.754 --> 01:52:43.394]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:52:43.414 --> 01:52:43.775]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:52:43.795 --> 01:52:45.056]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:52:53.118 --> 01:52:53.759]  We're good to go.
[01:53:14.839 --> 01:53:21.321]  Potassium iodate can protect against radioactive poisoning by filling the thyroid with good iodine.
[01:53:21.501 --> 01:53:26.582]  This shields the thyroid and prevents it from absorbing the harmful radioactive iodine.
[01:53:26.722 --> 01:53:35.585]  Potassium iodate is better than the iodide form because it is not as likely to cause upset stomachs in children, the elderly, the sick, and pets.
[01:53:35.865 --> 01:53:42.787]  Order the official potassium iodate for only $24 and save $5 by calling New Millennium at 888-
[01:53:43.507 --> 01:53:44.529]  803-4438.
[01:53:46.111 --> 01:53:47.674]  Call now and get free shipping.
[01:53:47.895 --> 01:53:48.235]  That's 888-803-4438.
[01:54:12.485 --> 01:54:15.426]  All right, folks, we're back live.
[01:54:17.067 --> 01:54:22.708]  I wasn't trying to argue with Allen, California.
[01:54:22.829 --> 01:54:35.693]  It's just that, you know, anybody that says it's the Catholics, it's the Jews, it's the Germans, I mean, certainly the British aristocracy of England, the Saxe-Coburg-Gothas are German.
[01:54:36.773 --> 01:54:39.274]  And even before that, they were French or Norman.
[01:54:41.056 --> 01:54:44.521]  But, I mean, you look at Forbes, you list who owns the companies.
[01:54:44.621 --> 01:54:51.370]  I mean, England owns the majority of American stock and companies, but it's not the British people, it's the British aristocracy.
[01:54:51.630 --> 01:54:55.676]  And they're all interrelated with the Germans, they're interrelated with the Dutch, they're interrelated with the French.
[01:54:56.465 --> 01:55:03.168]  I mean, it's all a family criminal enterprise, and they will occasionally set up boogeymen.
[01:55:03.568 --> 01:55:05.149]  They will have wars with each other.
[01:55:05.169 --> 01:55:10.851]  It's like the mafia has wars, but they continue their criminal activities against the people.
[01:55:10.891 --> 01:55:17.554]  But we have to get the general public to the point of just admitting to themselves that there is a world government as it's publicly announced.
[01:55:17.634 --> 01:55:18.255]  Paul Watson?
[01:55:19.155 --> 01:55:21.536]  Well, yeah, the fact is, if you go high enough,
[01:55:22.003 --> 01:55:22.965]  I think we're good to go.
[01:55:30.516 --> 01:55:34.939]  In Europe, if you go high enough up the chain, invariably, you will find a Rothschild.
[01:55:34.999 --> 01:55:41.843]  Just as in America, if you go high enough up in the chain of any of those institutions, you will find a Rockefeller.
[01:55:42.263 --> 01:55:46.405]  And so that's how it's a rigged game in the first place.
[01:55:46.705 --> 01:55:52.669]  There was a quote from Johannes B. Koppel, who was a former German defence ministry official,
[01:55:54.110 --> 01:55:56.391]  This is a rare quote actually, I only just came across it.
[01:55:56.471 --> 01:56:13.959]  He said, the interest behind the Bush administration, such as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Trilateral Commission, founded by Brzezinski for David Rockefeller, and the Bilderberg Group have prepared for and are now moving to implement open world dictatorship within the next five years.
[01:56:14.019 --> 01:56:17.561]  They are not fighting against terrorists, they are fighting against citizens.
[01:56:18.061 --> 01:56:22.826]  And he said that former German defense minister just a couple of years ago.
[01:56:22.846 --> 01:56:24.327]  So that's how they coordinate.
[01:56:24.347 --> 01:56:27.370]  No, I actually got that quote out of the German newspaper two years ago.
[01:56:27.410 --> 01:56:33.856]  Then the other German defense minister and former head technology minister who's been on this show, Andres Rambulo, said the exact same thing.
[01:56:35.271 --> 01:56:40.155]  And the final part of his quote was, this is more than a war against terrorism.
[01:56:40.175 --> 01:56:42.517]  This is a war against the citizens of all countries.
[01:56:42.557 --> 01:56:46.821]  The current elites are creating so much fear that people don't know how to respond.
[01:56:47.242 --> 01:56:52.506]  But they must remember this is a move to implement a world dictatorship within the next five years.
[01:56:52.566 --> 01:56:53.967]  There may not be another chance.
[01:56:54.848 --> 01:57:00.193]  Hey, Paul, why don't you post that on prisonplanet.tv during one of the breaks that's coming up?
[01:57:00.956 --> 01:57:02.037]  Okay, I will.
[01:57:02.097 --> 01:57:03.038]  And give the source of it.
[01:57:03.058 --> 01:57:05.581]  I remember seeing that in the German newspaper two years ago.
[01:57:06.702 --> 01:57:10.747]  We'll go back to calls, and then what's some of the news we're going to get into in the next hour?
[01:57:12.311 --> 01:57:32.899]  Three things that I want to cover are the bombing in Iraq today, the Saudi incident just a couple of days ago, and Ashcroft's terror alert three days ago, which again proves to be completely fake, as we can detail in the next part of the show.
[01:57:33.379 --> 01:57:36.460]  Tell folks about PrisonPlanet.tv in the next 30 seconds.
[01:57:37.661 --> 01:57:41.103]  Well, it's basically $5.95 a month, which is what?
[01:57:41.183 --> 01:57:44.345]  Two packs of cigarettes a month, a six-pack of beer.
[01:57:44.826 --> 01:57:47.548]  It's value for money, without a doubt.
[01:57:47.568 --> 01:57:50.930]  You get video every week, sometimes two videos a week.
[01:57:50.970 --> 01:57:55.053]  We've got one of Alex's speeches going up on the website tomorrow.
[01:57:55.694 --> 01:58:04.300]  Every audio interview from Alex's show, it's $0.15 a day if you subscribe for a year, $0.19 a day.
[01:58:06.059 --> 01:58:07.381]  If you subscribe monthly.
[01:58:07.881 --> 01:58:11.685]  And there's a lot more besides that on the way, so it's audio.
[01:58:11.845 --> 01:58:12.686]  PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:12.726 --> 01:58:18.172]  You can also go there and link through to the shopping cart to get my documentary films or Paul Watson's book.
[01:58:18.573 --> 01:58:22.097]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:58:22.437 --> 01:58:23.578]  Get my videos, folks.
[01:58:23.658 --> 01:58:24.579]  Make copies of them.
[01:58:24.840 --> 01:58:25.740]  Get them out to people.
[01:58:25.761 --> 01:58:25.801]  1-888-
[01:58:28.643 --> 01:58:28.703]  253-3139.
[01:58:28.763 --> 01:58:28.983]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:58:29.003 --> 01:58:31.466]  Or sign up at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:58:31.827 --> 01:58:34.170]  We'll be right back with the third hour.
[01:58:34.190 --> 01:58:34.650]  Stay with us.
[01:58:44.545 --> 01:58:45.226]  Hello, folks.

[01:59:34.175 --> 01:59:34.996]  Government cover-ups.
[01:59:35.056 --> 01:59:35.977]  You want answers?
[01:59:56.977 --> 01:59:57.858]  Well, so does he.
[01:59:57.878 --> 02:00:02.482]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:02.722 --> 02:00:06.865]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.247 --> 02:00:12.970]  All right, my friends, we're now into hour number three.
[02:00:13.811 --> 02:00:18.435]  We've read the mainstream news articles, so they're tasering one-year-old babies.
[02:00:20.290 --> 02:00:26.899]  We've got them openly saying martial law in Georgia for your safety during the GH Summit early next week.
[02:00:28.047 --> 02:00:29.888]  And the martial law is now in place there.
[02:00:30.428 --> 02:00:33.049]  We have Ashcroft putting out more fake terror alerts.
[02:00:33.149 --> 02:00:36.051]  Gary Hart to the CFR out fear-mongering.
[02:00:36.651 --> 02:00:41.693]  A bunch of Iraq news, Saudi Arabia news, with Paul Watson who joins us at least once a week.
[02:00:42.034 --> 02:00:50.538]  Paul Watson, author of Order Out of Chaos, the lead sponsor of terror in the New World Order, and my webmaster for prisonplanet.tv and prisonplanet.com.
[02:00:50.878 --> 02:00:52.959]  Paul, let's get some more of these callers out of the way, though.
[02:00:52.999 --> 02:00:57.561]  Hear what they have to say, and we'll get back into all that news you just mentioned at the end of the last hour.
[02:00:58.301 --> 02:01:02.202]  Michael in Hawaii, the tropical paradise overhead.
[02:01:03.022 --> 02:01:04.602]  Aloha, Alex and Paul.
[02:01:04.642 --> 02:01:09.423]  I just wanted to let you know that I just really enjoy that PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:01:09.943 --> 02:01:12.704]  Incredible, incredible, the video and all that you have on there.
[02:01:13.104 --> 02:01:15.284]  Thank you for putting it up, and I'm proud to be a member of it.
[02:01:15.364 --> 02:01:16.444]  Thank you for the support.
[02:01:16.464 --> 02:01:17.924]  A couple of quick questions.
[02:01:18.044 --> 02:01:18.985]  One for Paul.
[02:01:20.385 --> 02:01:27.006]  The story that you had a few weeks ago about the 5,000 bodies of the military being secretly stored on Cyprus...
[02:01:27.566 --> 02:01:34.710]  I had a retired colonel friend of mine who has a lot of contacts in the military, admirals, generals, etc.
[02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:38.732]  He was trying to find out about that and he couldn't find anything out.
[02:01:38.772 --> 02:01:44.134]  Have you had any more independent confirmation to back up that one story that you had?
[02:01:45.055 --> 02:01:46.796]  I haven't heard anything more about that.
[02:01:46.816 --> 02:01:51.498]  It came from a military source there in Greece who didn't want to be named.
[02:01:52.186 --> 02:02:03.391]  And it was basically that, yeah, from both the Afghan war and the Iraq war, they had 5,000 bodies on ice, which they didn't want to release, you know, to be publicly filmed.
[02:02:03.511 --> 02:02:07.573]  And we have gotten the evidence of the refrigeration units that they have shipped out there.
[02:02:07.633 --> 02:02:12.755]  We know they've covered up the numbers of dead in Afghanistan.
[02:02:13.335 --> 02:02:16.557]  And we know there's been a lot of cooking of the numbers there just about a month ago.
[02:02:18.018 --> 02:02:22.422]  Wolfowitz tried to say, we've lost 350 troops, and the reporters go, wait a minute, it's over 800.
[02:02:22.462 --> 02:02:24.044]  He goes, no, it's not.
[02:02:24.084 --> 02:02:24.784]  That's a fable.
[02:02:25.745 --> 02:02:28.748]  So these guys are just amazing.
[02:02:29.729 --> 02:02:30.890]  One more question for you, Alex.
[02:02:31.250 --> 02:02:33.732]  Are you still planning to put up that special...
[02:02:38.025 --> 02:02:43.787]  That's another thing we need to do.
[02:02:44.147 --> 02:02:47.689]  Every day we post, or every few days, new articles about the coming draft.
[02:02:47.729 --> 02:02:53.691]  But, Paul, we should grab all the different pieces of legislation and create a draft archive, or do we already have that?
[02:02:54.565 --> 02:03:10.469]  We have a sub-archive which is Working for Homeland in the Police State section, but we are updating all those archives as we speak, so I'm sure during that process we will be able to get that archive up, which focuses solely on the draft legislation.
[02:03:11.930 --> 02:03:14.470]  Where is the Working for Homeland sub-section?
[02:03:15.191 --> 02:03:20.392]  It's Police State Archive, and then there's a sub-section called Working for Homeland.
[02:03:22.393 --> 02:03:23.613]  I hope that that can help you.
[02:03:24.449 --> 02:03:25.230]  Sure, sure.
[02:03:25.430 --> 02:03:32.938]  Anything you guys can put up there, but I really think that having those 12 pieces of legislation in one place would really be an asset to a lot of people.
[02:03:33.538 --> 02:03:34.679]  All right, we'll get that done.
[02:03:34.699 --> 02:03:36.081]  That's something I've been calling for.
[02:03:36.141 --> 02:03:37.482]  We just get overwhelmed here.
[02:03:38.423 --> 02:03:43.008]  We're about to break again, and I want to take a few more calls and we'll get into this news, but speaking of the draft...
[02:03:44.566 --> 02:03:57.678]  We have an article here out of the American Free Press that I want to go over, and then a story here out of South Korea to give you an idea of what this type of national compulsory service draft means.
[02:03:58.158 --> 02:03:59.740]  This isn't the old World War II draft.
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:04.064]  This is the type of draft where most of us will serve domestically as slaves of the government.
[02:04:04.404 --> 02:04:08.928]  These two articles integrate in together in a nightmarish way.
[02:04:09.463 --> 02:04:10.564]  Sound good to you, Paul?
[02:04:39.150 --> 02:04:39.753]  Sounds great.
[02:04:40.295 --> 02:04:42.021]  We'll be right back, and you heard it here.
[02:04:42.101 --> 02:04:43.888]  PrisonPlanet.tv is the place to be.
[02:04:46.736 --> 02:04:47.736]  It's finally here.
[02:04:47.876 --> 02:04:48.837]  Spring has arrived.
[02:04:49.037 --> 02:04:51.997]  I can always tell because I get a flood of gardening and seed catalogs.
[02:04:52.217 --> 02:04:55.678]  This year, though, I'm not even looking at seed catalogs because I don't have to.
[02:04:55.878 --> 02:05:04.040]  I grow my own seed now from year to year, and you can too with the help of the ARC Institute's brand new 40-variety non-hybrid heirloom seed collection.
[02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:08.021]  With ARC's heirlooms, you can save seed from this year's garden to plant next year.
[02:05:08.241 --> 02:05:13.262]  It's fun, it's easy, and your garden produce tastes better than any you'll ever find at the grocery store.
[02:05:13.462 --> 02:05:14.143]  We're good to go.
[02:05:14.263 --> 02:05:14.923]  We're good to go.
[02:05:14.943 --> 02:05:15.584]  We're good to go.
[02:05:15.604 --> 02:05:16.185]  We're good to go.
[02:05:29.818 --> 02:05:35.282]  Save money, eat healthy, grow your own delicious secure food supply and your own seeds year after year.
[02:05:35.482 --> 02:05:37.383]  Call the Ark Institute toll free at 800-255-1912.

[02:05:46.050 --> 02:05:47.551]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:05:47.751 --> 02:05:50.833]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[02:05:50.974 --> 02:05:54.876]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[02:05:54.916 --> 02:05:59.159]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2, The Takeover.
[02:05:59.499 --> 02:06:03.262]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[02:06:03.422 --> 02:06:05.264]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[02:06:05.404 --> 02:06:08.726]  Riot police attacked people on the streets indiscriminately.
[02:06:08.766 --> 02:06:09.847]  The medical bills...
[02:06:11.448 --> 02:06:13.469]  Are going to be enormous for me.
[02:06:13.629 --> 02:06:16.651]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[02:06:16.851 --> 02:06:19.753]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[02:06:20.194 --> 02:06:26.318]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[02:06:26.838 --> 02:06:30.641]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[02:06:31.041 --> 02:06:32.402]  Order your video today.
[02:06:32.803 --> 02:06:35.765]  Call toll free at 888-253-3139.
[02:06:36.345 --> 02:06:40.929]  The number to order the takeover again is 888-253-3139.
[02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:45.012]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[02:06:45.272 --> 02:06:48.515]  Introducing the most efficient gravity filter available.
[02:06:48.595 --> 02:06:52.698]  You know, if you were to throw 100 ball bearings at a magnet, most would bounce off.
[02:06:52.998 --> 02:06:55.780]  But if you place them on the magnet, all would stick.
[02:06:55.980 --> 02:06:58.381]  The same principle applies in water filtration.
[02:06:58.561 --> 02:07:07.226]  Most filtration systems force water through the filter at 60 to 90 PSI, causing water molecules to race through the filter in less than a second.
[02:07:07.406 --> 02:07:08.766]  The Berkey light is different.
[02:07:08.946 --> 02:07:15.190]  Water molecules take 5 to 10 minutes to pass through the torturous path of the self-sterilizing filters.
[02:07:15.430 --> 02:07:21.393]  This allows the proprietary media formulation to remove and reduce pathogenic bacteria, cysts,
[02:07:21.813 --> 02:07:22.873]  Big Brother Big Brother
[02:07:52.387 --> 02:07:56.273]  You want answers?
[02:07:57.034 --> 02:07:58.957]  Well, so does he.
[02:07:58.977 --> 02:08:02.282]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:02.802 --> 02:08:06.868]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:09.964 --> 02:08:11.545]  Alright, Alex Jones back live.
[02:08:11.745 --> 02:08:13.247]  Paul Watson riding shotgun with us.
[02:08:13.267 --> 02:08:20.312]  Your call is coming up here in just a few minutes at 800-259-9231.
[02:08:20.332 --> 02:08:21.192]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:08:21.553 --> 02:08:23.154]  I mentioned this Newsweek article earlier.
[02:08:23.254 --> 02:08:24.375]  Future of shopping.
[02:08:24.935 --> 02:08:31.500]  Tiny silicon identity chips being put into everyday objects and even implanted under the skin are changing the way we consume.
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:34.782]  And it goes into how wonderful it is and how we all need it.
[02:08:35.603 --> 02:08:37.164]  Well, this is how it can also be used.
[02:08:37.691 --> 02:08:39.312]  A lot of corporations here in the U.S.
[02:08:39.352 --> 02:08:45.454]  are now putting this in, and your new national ID card that the New York Times is calling for is going to have this in it as well.
[02:08:46.174 --> 02:08:49.115]  Subway workers' locator chips create stir.
[02:08:49.776 --> 02:08:51.336]  This feeds into the draft.
[02:08:51.656 --> 02:08:52.316]  You'll learn why.
[02:08:53.177 --> 02:09:06.882]  The Seoul Metropolitan Subway Corporation, this is the Times of Seoul, by the way, the Seoul Metropolitan Subway Corporation is facing charges of human rights abuse due to its measure to require...
[02:09:07.927 --> 02:09:17.731]  Conscripted public service personnel, that's a quote, to carry plastic cards embedded with electronic chips that can reveal their location during working hours.
[02:09:19.131 --> 02:09:20.052]  Now, these are conscripted.
[02:09:20.072 --> 02:09:20.692]  They're not paid.
[02:09:20.712 --> 02:09:25.354]  They spend about 20, 30 hours a week, just like we'll have to, going around tattling.
[02:09:25.374 --> 02:09:26.114]  And it says they do that.
[02:09:26.634 --> 02:09:37.178]  Critics argue such a policy is a clear violation of human rights while the corporation, which operates four of the eight subway lines in the capital area, claims the measure is necessary to monitor those who often break away from work.
[02:09:37.739 --> 02:09:42.903]  The corporation said it distributed some 230 cards among subway stations on lines 1 through 4.
[02:09:43.463 --> 02:09:54.971]  On May 26th, the public service personnel, known in Korea as Kong King Wong, are those who maintain order in subway stations instead of serving their compulsory military service.
[02:09:55.511 --> 02:10:01.555]  They are required to carry the cards, which they call electronic dog tags, at all times while on duty in the stations.
[02:10:01.635 --> 02:10:05.018]  My cousins told me they've all been told they're getting microchips, by the way, in the U.S.
[02:10:05.078 --> 02:10:05.258]  Army.
[02:10:06.471 --> 02:10:08.671]  But we hang the cards around our neck during working hours.
[02:10:08.751 --> 02:10:13.792]  Subway officials carry card detectors, which can reveal where we are and our shift schedules as well.
[02:10:13.993 --> 02:10:20.214]  One of the personnel at the City Hall Station on Line 1 said, There is a big brother in the station who can see our location any time.
[02:10:20.594 --> 02:10:22.574]  They want as long as they carry these cards.
[02:10:23.214 --> 02:10:26.215]  I often feel like a prisoner who's being watched by prison guards.
[02:10:26.755 --> 02:10:30.996]  So they can figure it out in North Korea, but already a lot of city workers have this year.
[02:10:31.496 --> 02:10:36.077]  All new cell phones after October 1, 2001 track you down to just a few feet.
[02:10:36.918 --> 02:10:39.259]  But that's the new loving national draft.
[02:10:39.359 --> 02:10:45.262]  And during Y2K, the Austin police showed up with these federally issued emergency cards, and they have them nationwide.
[02:10:46.602 --> 02:10:49.404]  So that feeds into this article out of American Free Press.
[02:10:49.644 --> 02:10:54.306]  Actions indicate administration has plans to reinstate military draft if Bush is re-elected.
[02:10:54.346 --> 02:10:59.308]  A military draft may be reinstated by mid-2005 if President Bush is re-elected in November.
[02:10:59.995 --> 02:11:06.181]  An appropriation of 28 million has been provided in the current defense budget to bring the nation's selective service system up to speed.
[02:11:06.201 --> 02:11:11.367]  It also is to include women, which many people believe will likely lead to a national draft of young men and women.
[02:11:11.647 --> 02:11:13.108]  They've introduced a bunch of bills, 12 bills.
[02:11:14.289 --> 02:11:16.330]  The Senators have called for it, and it continues.
[02:11:16.790 --> 02:11:25.314]  The Pentagon has begun a program to fill 10,350 local draft board positions and 11,070 appeals board posts as soon as possible.
[02:11:25.814 --> 02:11:33.077]  Last September, the Pentagon ran an ad for volunteers to fill the slots, but when it was reported in the national media, the ad was quietly pulled.
[02:11:34.218 --> 02:11:37.479]  Registration for the draft ended in 1975 under President Jimmy Carter.
[02:11:37.519 --> 02:11:38.460]  However, registration was...
[02:11:39.221 --> 02:11:45.345]  Reinstated for all men between the ages of 18 and 25 in 1980 and an amendment to the Military Selective Service Act.
[02:11:45.405 --> 02:11:48.887]  Currently, legislation is pending in the House and Senate to renew the draft.
[02:11:49.527 --> 02:11:51.828]  In the House, there is H.R.
[02:11:51.848 --> 02:11:54.450]  163, which was introduced last year by Representative Charles Rangel.
[02:11:56.611 --> 02:11:56.811]  H.R.
[02:11:56.831 --> 02:11:58.432]  163 has 14 co-sponsors.
[02:11:59.013 --> 02:12:02.815]  Most of those who have signed on to support the bill are members of the Congressional Black Caucus.
[02:12:03.627 --> 02:12:06.410]  And it goes on to mention other bills in the Senate.
[02:12:06.810 --> 02:12:14.178]  A companion bill, S-89, the National Compulsory Service Act, was introduced by Senator Ernest F. Fritz Hollings.
[02:12:15.379 --> 02:12:16.740]  And it goes on and on.
[02:12:16.860 --> 02:12:22.906]  He says we all share the benefits of life in America, and under this plan we will all help shoulder the burden of defending our freedoms.
[02:12:24.127 --> 02:12:25.189]  And it goes on and on.
[02:12:25.449 --> 02:12:27.551]  Paul comments to all of what I just laid out.
[02:12:30.197 --> 02:12:33.722]  Bill, I think it's S89.
[02:12:34.443 --> 02:12:35.665]  It's bipartisan.
[02:12:35.886 --> 02:12:44.338]  I mean, Chuck Hagel, the Republican, introduced it, and the list of people supporting it, such as, you know, people like Pete Stark, Ernest Hollings.
[02:12:46.124 --> 02:12:47.025]  We're good to go.
[02:13:06.700 --> 02:13:07.481]  That's what it's about.
[02:13:07.521 --> 02:13:11.605]  It's about phasing employment into working for the homeland.
[02:13:11.986 --> 02:13:19.493]  Because you'll notice that over the past few years, these cameras have gone into offices tracking employees' emails.
[02:13:19.673 --> 02:13:24.217]  They're already using RFID tags right here in Austin at several big companies.
[02:13:24.257 --> 02:13:28.682]  But on top of this, Paul, it's clear they're going to have the election, have a huge terror attack.
[02:13:29.142 --> 02:13:30.523]  Bring in the National Draft.
[02:13:30.763 --> 02:13:31.984]  Oh, we have to do it.
[02:13:32.665 --> 02:13:37.929]  But, I mean, look, they've introduced the bills, they're pushing for it, and people are still in total denial, Paul.
[02:13:38.850 --> 02:13:42.292]  And there's another article out of the San Francisco Chronicle today.
[02:13:42.372 --> 02:13:48.697]  Pentagon can't seem to kill idea of military draft, but it has Rumsfeld's quote in there, which is,
[02:13:49.224 --> 02:13:59.227]  I don't know anyone in the executive branch of the government who believes it would be appropriate or necessary at the same time that you have all these bills introduced to bring it in.
[02:13:59.347 --> 02:14:08.170]  This is the same guy who said on Face the Nation, I've never said Saddam had weapons or was an imminent threat, and there's hundreds of quotes of him saying it.
[02:14:09.311 --> 02:14:14.652]  Well, yeah, it's the same guy who forgets that he was on the board selling the nuclear material to North Korea.
[02:14:14.692 --> 02:14:16.273]  He forgets, you know, shaking...
[02:14:19.774 --> 02:14:25.758]  Well, it's like Ashcroft saying there's no new anti-terror legislation months after it's introduced.
[02:14:27.059 --> 02:14:31.282]  Bush saying that the biggest amnesty ever isn't an amnesty.
[02:14:32.566 --> 02:14:53.680]  And I still get emails from people who, you know, neocons who can string one or two sentences together, so I sometimes reply to them, that still refuse to believe that Bush opened the borders wide up, and then you send them the article with, you know, the quote, 15% increase in illegal invasion, and still they deny it, so the sun didn't come up this morning.
[02:14:55.301 --> 02:14:55.581]  I know.
[02:14:55.662 --> 02:15:00.685]  How do you deal with that invincible ignorance, that wanton, willful desire not to face the facts?
[02:15:01.423 --> 02:15:02.263]  You cannot deal with it.
[02:15:02.323 --> 02:15:14.108]  It's a dead end because no matter how much information you present to them, even if it's from so-called conservative news organizations like World Net Daily who released that article, they still won't believe it.
[02:15:14.168 --> 02:15:16.769]  It's a complete dead end because they're in denial.
[02:15:19.330 --> 02:15:21.371]  Oh, it's just incredible.
[02:15:23.412 --> 02:15:26.293]  And they talk about how recruiting is way down to the military.
[02:15:28.399 --> 02:15:29.039]  They're waiting.
[02:15:29.139 --> 02:15:32.301]  I mean, they're getting the whole thing lined up, Paul, for the next terror attack.
[02:15:33.722 --> 02:15:38.045]  Which will be shortly after the election, according to all the forecasts that we've done.
[02:15:39.205 --> 02:15:41.046]  Let's talk to Harry in New Jersey.
[02:15:41.106 --> 02:15:42.087]  Harry, you're on the air.
[02:15:42.127 --> 02:15:42.567]  Go ahead.
[02:15:42.587 --> 02:15:43.628]  Hi, fellas.
[02:15:43.668 --> 02:15:44.048]  How you doing?
[02:15:44.288 --> 02:15:44.608]  Fine.
[02:15:44.929 --> 02:15:46.550]  Listen, I'll mention something.
[02:15:46.750 --> 02:15:53.794]  The Rothschilds control two-thirds of the world's wealth, and the Rockefellers control one-tenth of the world's wealth.
[02:15:53.854 --> 02:15:55.094]  I just want to mention that to you.
[02:15:56.035 --> 02:15:57.276]  Another thing I want to mention is...
[02:15:58.240 --> 02:16:11.086]  I'm going to be... I was at a Ralph Nader rally, and he gave me a copy of his book, Taking on the Corporate Government in an Age of Surrender, Crashing the Party.
[02:16:11.586 --> 02:16:16.868]  But, you know, I'd like to get Nader into the debate so we can have some open dialogue in these debates.
[02:16:17.229 --> 02:16:17.669]  I don't know.
[02:16:17.729 --> 02:16:19.650]  How do you fellas feel about something like that?
[02:16:19.670 --> 02:16:21.551]  Well, we've had Nader on this broadcast.
[02:16:21.571 --> 02:16:23.671]  I agree with about half of what he says.
[02:16:23.691 --> 02:16:26.793]  He talks about the real problems, but then gives a big government...
[02:16:27.344 --> 02:16:28.405]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:16:28.425 --> 02:16:30.766]  I don't know, Nader has a lot of wild ideas.
[02:16:30.786 --> 02:16:33.087]  I mean, I know he's for gay marriages and lesbian marriages.
[02:16:33.127 --> 02:16:34.288]  I mean, that's off the wall, but
[02:16:55.249 --> 02:16:59.550]  Some of that stuff like Naft and Gatt, I mean, I like them to debate stuff like that.
[02:16:59.590 --> 02:17:06.932]  Well, yeah, I mean, he agrees with Pat Buchanan on about half his stands, and I agree with Pat Buchanan on a lot of stuff, but disagree with him on a bunch of other stuff, too.
[02:17:08.032 --> 02:17:11.833]  I think we've got to open a can of worms up on these two parties and let them have it, you know?
[02:17:11.893 --> 02:17:14.714]  Well, I mean, we don't have two parties, but I agree with him.
[02:17:15.754 --> 02:17:16.795]  Okay, good to hear from you.
[02:17:17.075 --> 02:17:17.835]  Any comments, Paul?
[02:17:18.949 --> 02:17:23.535]  The problem with Nader is that the bedrock of his platform is completely rotten.
[02:17:23.575 --> 02:17:29.661]  He's pro-abortion, he's pro-gun control, and even that won't get him in the debate.
[02:17:29.722 --> 02:17:37.811]  You won't get someone like Aaron Russo in the debate, who on basically all the issues is in line with our thinking, libertarian thinking.
[02:17:38.711 --> 02:17:45.897]  But, you know, you won't get him in the debate because they don't want to give him that platform to educate people, even though we know he's not going to win.
[02:17:45.917 --> 02:17:46.858]  Thanks for reminding me.
[02:17:46.878 --> 02:17:48.279]  I want to get Aaron Russo back on.
[02:17:48.639 --> 02:17:49.440]  Ron in New York.
[02:17:49.540 --> 02:17:50.340]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:17:50.460 --> 02:17:51.341]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:17:51.561 --> 02:17:51.942]  Good, sir.
[02:17:52.262 --> 02:18:03.090]  We understand that the Commander-in-Chief spoke at the War College the other night as a spokesman for the international global elite of the New World Order.
[02:18:03.190 --> 02:18:05.412]  Many statements were made
[02:18:06.263 --> 02:18:09.124]  They contradict the reality of what is actually occurring.
[02:18:09.564 --> 02:18:10.364]  Two stood out.
[02:18:10.845 --> 02:18:15.146]  They are, quote, the Taliban seeks to control the entire Middle East.
[02:18:15.786 --> 02:18:20.448]  They seek the control of every person and mind and soul.
[02:18:21.508 --> 02:18:21.968]  End quote.
[02:18:21.988 --> 02:18:24.529]  Well, the Taliban is a creation of the CIA.
[02:18:24.589 --> 02:18:29.151]  Even the Washington Post admits they shipped in millions of radical Hadiths radicalizing the Muslims.
[02:18:29.411 --> 02:18:30.691]  They're trying to stir it up.
[02:18:30.711 --> 02:18:32.112]  That's why they brought all this torture out.
[02:18:32.472 --> 02:18:40.737]  But that is instead exactly what the New World Order is doing, seeking to control every person and mind and soul.
[02:18:40.917 --> 02:18:45.800]  Yeah, democratizing means appointing puppet dictatorships, raping and murdering and slaughtering.
[02:18:46.200 --> 02:18:50.223]  And Paul, new rape information has come out, but it's not debatable.
[02:18:50.463 --> 02:18:52.204]  The Pentagon's own document admits it.
[02:18:52.844 --> 02:18:59.208]  The other statement is, quote, I sent the American troops to Iraq to defend our security.
[02:18:59.808 --> 02:19:01.009]  But the correct statement is,
[02:19:01.838 --> 02:19:03.519]  Should be.
[02:19:04.079 --> 02:19:10.661]  I sent American troops to Iraq who were dying for a lie.
[02:19:11.681 --> 02:19:13.001]  That should be the correct statement.
[02:19:15.602 --> 02:19:17.503]  You mean Bush lies to us?
[02:19:18.663 --> 02:19:21.504]  Alex, another point on the Christian hierarchy here.
[02:19:22.945 --> 02:19:25.665]  Christian leaders are for the war.
[02:19:25.745 --> 02:19:28.886]  The Patriot Act and military tribunals in Guantanamo.
[02:19:29.366 --> 02:19:30.907]  Jay Sekula was appointed
[02:19:31.448 --> 02:19:36.352]  By Attorney General Ashcroft, according to Kevin Phillips' book, American Dynasty.
[02:19:37.113 --> 02:19:40.516]  He was appointed as an advisor... Tell you what, stay there.
[02:19:41.057 --> 02:19:44.159]  We'll talk about the neocon Judas Cuts when we get back.
[02:19:44.179 --> 02:19:44.640]  Stay with us.
[02:19:46.900 --> 02:19:49.904]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:19:50.245 --> 02:19:59.077]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water, whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:19:59.397 --> 02:20:04.084]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:20:04.544 --> 02:20:11.267]  The Berkey Lot is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:20:11.667 --> 02:20:23.452]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:20:23.912 --> 02:20:28.377]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright it can be used as a reading light.
[02:20:28.557 --> 02:20:30.880]  Get the Berkey Light for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.

[02:20:35.625 --> 02:20:36.686]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:20:45.754 --> 02:20:47.475]  They begin with a civil service.
[02:20:47.495 --> 02:20:49.057]  To rescue the hostages to have.
[02:20:49.317 --> 02:20:50.378]  It is headed for.
[02:20:50.558 --> 02:20:51.478]  To the war on terror.
[02:20:51.618 --> 02:20:52.759]  Until they are credited.
[02:20:53.240 --> 02:20:53.620]  Senator.

[02:22:12.404 --> 02:22:17.725]  A current effort is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[02:22:17.985 --> 02:22:22.726]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[02:22:23.066 --> 02:22:30.688]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver.
[02:22:31.008 --> 02:22:36.469]  While paper investments currently have been driven by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6,000 years.
[02:22:37.569 --> 02:22:41.093]  For more information, call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:41.434 --> 02:22:43.716]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:22:43.756 --> 02:22:48.161]  The grass is always greener with a wheatgrass kit from wheatgrasskits.com.
[02:22:48.282 --> 02:22:51.665]  Their mission is to provide you with nature's most perfect living food.
[02:22:51.685 --> 02:22:54.028]  Skip the high prices at the neighborhood juice bar.
[02:22:54.188 --> 02:22:58.333]  Grow your own wheatgrass, barley grass, sunflower greens, sprouts, or herbs.
[02:22:59.693 --> 02:23:01.574]  It's easy to do indoors or out.
[02:23:01.834 --> 02:23:03.235]  Start with a basic wheatgrass kit.
[02:23:03.435 --> 02:23:06.856]  It's everything you'll need to grow stamina-building, nutrient-rich wheatgrass.
[02:23:07.196 --> 02:23:15.298]  The kit includes 5 pounds of organic wheatgrass seed, reusable growing trays, organic soil, mineral additive, and the book, Wheatgrass, Nature's Finest Miracle.
[02:23:15.498 --> 02:23:18.899]  Or get the deluxe kit that adds barley, grass seed, and sunflower greens.
[02:23:19.159 --> 02:23:24.061]  The health benefits of wheatgrass are legendary, but perhaps one of the best benefits are the antioxidants.
[02:23:24.241 --> 02:23:24.841]  We're good to go.
[02:23:24.861 --> 02:23:25.141]  I think?
[02:23:55.106 --> 02:24:00.790]  Adolf Hitler was an occultist, but he used the Bible.
[02:24:00.810 --> 02:24:05.974]  He had a lot of so-called Christian leaders there putting out his propaganda.
[02:24:06.214 --> 02:24:07.815]  And this has happened many times.
[02:24:07.875 --> 02:24:11.518]  I mean, Jim Jones said that, you know, follow me, Jesus says so.
[02:24:12.559 --> 02:24:18.543]  And so the J. Seculos of the world that get up there and act like they're defending Christians and do on a few issues, they're like the ACLU.
[02:24:19.295 --> 02:24:21.557]  Does a few good issues, stabs you in the back on others.
[02:24:21.577 --> 02:24:23.318]  You know, the Patriot Act's good.
[02:24:23.358 --> 02:24:25.160]  It's a lie that it affects citizens.
[02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:26.921]  You know, on and on and on.
[02:24:27.421 --> 02:24:28.422]  This is what they're doing.
[02:24:29.143 --> 02:24:35.107]  And, you know, I've been criticized because I've quoted Pat Robertson, who said China's doing what it has to do with forced abortion and infanticide.
[02:24:35.708 --> 02:24:38.930]  I mean, regardless of which side of the debate you're on on abortion, I'm pro-life.
[02:24:39.451 --> 02:24:42.733]  I mean, don't we all agree you shouldn't force women to have abortions?
[02:24:43.053 --> 02:24:48.818]  So he can be more radical than the pro-abort people, but that somehow is okay, and I'm bad for quoting him.
[02:24:49.554 --> 02:24:50.775]  I guess I'm not Christian.
[02:24:51.656 --> 02:24:54.938]  But go ahead and finish up your comments that you were making, Ron.
[02:24:55.038 --> 02:24:55.859]  Let me develop this.
[02:24:55.959 --> 02:24:58.521]  I can read a short scripture that's applicable here.
[02:25:00.322 --> 02:25:04.445]  Jay Sekulow said he helped write the Patriot Act.
[02:25:04.566 --> 02:25:18.136]  Pat Robertson on his TV program says it is necessary for the Patriot Act, necessary for fighting the terrorists, and he favors military tribunals in Guantanamo over civilian courts for detainees.
[02:25:18.809 --> 02:25:23.336]  Which is at times may include American citizens.
[02:25:23.917 --> 02:25:32.070]  If this is all true, and it is, then these Christian leaders and others, unnamed, are affirming and espousing...
[02:25:32.762 --> 02:25:36.564]  The fast-approaching government of the Antichrist, the false messiah.
[02:25:37.004 --> 02:25:37.984]  Yeah, basically that.
[02:25:38.084 --> 02:25:48.028]  And they're going to say that the Antichrist is Jesus ruling us and loving us and that we're the terrorists and to have our heads cut off because we're, you know... And I'm not joking, folks.
[02:25:48.208 --> 02:25:49.789]  You talk about the grand illusion.
[02:25:51.029 --> 02:25:51.529]  It's happening.
[02:25:51.549 --> 02:25:52.230]  Thanks for the call.
[02:25:52.910 --> 02:25:57.752]  Paul Watson comments on the fake Christians heading up the New World Order.
[02:25:58.598 --> 02:25:58.838]  I think.
[02:26:26.744 --> 02:26:34.769]  Oh golly gee, you say he attends some men's gathering each year, but I see no proof, only your stupid paranoid rantings.
[02:26:34.869 --> 02:26:49.117]  So then when you send them the link to the official Bohemian Grove annual with pictures of Bush and his father in it, and Bush himself admits that he goes there every year, still, you know, it's a case of self-denial.
[02:26:49.157 --> 02:26:51.919]  They don't believe it because they're locked in this paradigm where
[02:26:52.966 --> 02:26:59.511]  Their belief system has to be maintained, and anything that challenges it basically has to be fought off as an enemy.
[02:26:59.791 --> 02:27:01.472]  Well, it was the same thing with Bill Clinton.
[02:27:01.492 --> 02:27:04.794]  We'd expose Bill Clinton, and these Democrats would not listen.
[02:27:06.458 --> 02:27:10.041]  Just because they associated their power with them, they had invested in it.
[02:27:10.302 --> 02:27:25.958]  The double thing with that is that liberals will protest all day about the treatment of Iraqis as subhuman, which is right, but then they will, you know, march for abortion, which is basically treating something, treating a fetus as subhuman, saying it's not
[02:27:27.200 --> 02:27:28.062]  So you can abort it.
[02:27:28.162 --> 02:27:37.241]  So the neocons and the liberals are locked in together on that ideology of treating people as subhuman to torture and kill them, basically.
[02:27:38.436 --> 02:27:39.176]  Well said.
[02:27:39.476 --> 02:27:42.158]  I'm going to take like four or five more calls.
[02:27:42.198 --> 02:27:42.958]  I don't want to cover news.
[02:27:42.978 --> 02:27:49.501]  This is the New York Times saying the National ID card's good and the Saudi Arabia shootings and the bombing in Iraq with Paul.
[02:27:50.421 --> 02:27:51.721]  But let's go to Tim.
[02:27:51.781 --> 02:27:53.262]  Tim got cut off earlier or something.
[02:27:53.282 --> 02:27:55.063]  He said he had police surrounding him.
[02:27:55.423 --> 02:27:56.563]  He was in Colorado.
[02:27:56.583 --> 02:27:57.844]  His neighbors are harassing him.
[02:27:58.544 --> 02:28:01.385]  Now, just in a nutshell, what's going on with you, Tim?
[02:28:03.965 --> 02:28:10.629]  I'm in an upper end neighborhood and I guess obviously one of the neighbors is an upper end official.
[02:28:11.190 --> 02:28:15.872]  I've been in a lot of intimidation and stuff like that, but that's no big deal and that wasn't far enough for them.
[02:28:16.373 --> 02:28:18.034]  So now I have four cop cars.
[02:28:18.134 --> 02:28:19.394]  This was just like a week ago.
[02:28:19.414 --> 02:28:21.876]  Four cop cars surrounding me in my driveway.
[02:28:22.779 --> 02:28:33.413]  Seven cops got out gunpoint saying that I didn't have a driver's license and a failure to yield right-of-way to an emergency vehicle and all these tickets.
[02:28:33.954 --> 02:28:36.498]  And I went to Motor Vehicles with my pastor the next day.
[02:28:37.199 --> 02:28:41.161]  And they said, there's nothing wrong with your driver's license.
[02:28:41.341 --> 02:28:43.982]  And I have all this evidence if you'd like me to fax it.
[02:28:44.022 --> 02:28:46.363]  And they're just making up these stories.
[02:28:46.583 --> 02:28:49.544]  Well, it just sounds like basic New World Order type activity.
[02:28:49.604 --> 02:28:52.205]  I mean, I see these stories all the time, sir.
[02:28:52.566 --> 02:28:53.186]  Oh, okay.
[02:28:53.386 --> 02:28:58.068]  I mean, I guess I'm just looking for where to turn here because I want it to stop, you know?
[02:28:59.336 --> 02:29:01.958]  So you're building a house next to somebody that doesn't like you?
[02:29:02.278 --> 02:29:04.280]  Well, I'm not obedient to him.
[02:29:04.320 --> 02:29:15.888]  You know, I had a job trailer there, and he didn't like it, and he wanted me to move it, and he came in the house when it was almost complete threatening me, and those three people there, witnesses... Well, then you need to go file criminal charges on him.
[02:29:16.688 --> 02:29:19.030]  Well, then the police are making up all these tickets now.
[02:29:19.050 --> 02:29:20.411]  I just told you what to do, though, sir.
[02:29:20.691 --> 02:29:23.673]  Now, what about the tickets from the police?
[02:29:24.054 --> 02:29:25.935]  Well, I would deal first with the threats.
[02:29:27.182 --> 02:29:29.025]  Okay, you need to not just sit there and take that.
[02:29:29.045 --> 02:29:29.646]  Thanks for the call.
[02:29:30.607 --> 02:29:33.290]  Come back, take two or three more calls, and then we'll get into more news.
[02:29:33.330 --> 02:29:33.831]  Stay with us.
[02:29:36.535 --> 02:29:37.436]  We're on the march.
[02:29:37.917 --> 02:29:39.519]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:43.124]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:48.746 --> 02:29:54.230]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:29:54.650 --> 02:29:58.873]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[02:29:59.113 --> 02:30:06.158]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:30:06.539 --> 02:30:12.643]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:30:12.783 --> 02:30:14.004]  There are no side effects.
[02:30:14.184 --> 02:30:14.644]  We're good to go.

[02:31:59.263 --> 02:32:07.886]  Super Silver Solution has been clinically proven to be at least 200 to 300% more effective in killing bacteria than any other colloidal silver on the market.
[02:32:08.086 --> 02:32:10.268]  SuperSilver is not like any colloidal silver.

[02:32:51.275 --> 02:32:53.156]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:32:53.176 --> 02:32:56.478]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:04.102 --> 02:33:07.964]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[02:33:08.004 --> 02:33:08.905]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:33:09.025 --> 02:33:14.168]  I read this article out of Roanoke earlier where they have the DARE officer in a...
[02:33:15.037 --> 02:33:20.320]  Fifth grade boy went up and tried to hug her after the class for teaching him how to be a secret police tattletale.
[02:33:20.340 --> 02:33:22.622]  That's what they do, writing dossiers on you and your family.
[02:33:23.763 --> 02:33:27.485]  And she grabbed his arm behind his back, slammed him down, all of this.
[02:33:27.565 --> 02:33:29.346]  But she got in trouble.
[02:33:29.386 --> 02:33:39.313]  But I read this article out of Arizona, out of Tucson, talking about a nine-year-old girl subdued with a stun gun after being handcuffed by South Tucson police.
[02:33:39.353 --> 02:33:41.134]  And it goes on to say, records kept...
[02:33:41.701 --> 02:33:46.165]  Show that as of six months ago, ten children, seven and younger, have been hit with tasers.
[02:33:46.225 --> 02:33:47.826]  Some were as young as one year old.
[02:33:49.408 --> 02:33:55.033]  And it says, at first blush, this is going to look bad, said Steve Tuttle, a spokesman for Taser International.
[02:33:55.393 --> 02:33:59.036]  But this is going to be an issue of, was it reasonable for us?
[02:33:59.196 --> 02:34:00.377]  What are the alternatives?
[02:34:01.238 --> 02:34:01.939]  And he goes on.
[02:34:02.979 --> 02:34:04.681]  I mean, this just shows the mindset.
[02:34:05.301 --> 02:34:09.225]  Making excuses for tasering, I guess smaller than toddlers now,
[02:34:10.246 --> 02:34:12.407]  This just goes into this whole mindset.
[02:34:12.447 --> 02:34:13.768]  Paul Watson, any comments?
[02:34:14.508 --> 02:34:17.690]  Well, yeah, it's the mindset, and obviously above that is the training.
[02:34:17.970 --> 02:34:22.393]  I mean, arresting eight-year-old girls for stealing rabbits.
[02:34:22.513 --> 02:34:24.394]  We had that case a couple of weeks ago.
[02:34:25.234 --> 02:34:30.097]  Arresting high school students who wear baseball caps the wrong way.
[02:34:30.377 --> 02:34:34.539]  I mean, it's insanity, but it's the training that they're being given to treat us as the enemy.
[02:34:34.739 --> 02:34:35.820]  Honor roll, students.
[02:34:37.623 --> 02:34:38.223]  Arresting them.
[02:34:38.784 --> 02:34:48.208]  And on top of this, Paul, now we have the New York Times calling for a national ID card.
[02:34:48.248 --> 02:34:58.173]  I have the editorial here in front of me, and then, of course, it's on the website, coming out and telling us it's time for a national ID card.
[02:34:58.213 --> 02:35:03.176]  But whereas in reality, Paul, we already have a national ID card in our country and your country.
[02:35:03.236 --> 02:35:03.976]  Explain that to people.
[02:35:04.864 --> 02:35:15.669]  Well, yeah, and it admits that in the article that the driver's license is already the de facto national ID card because you have to present it as a form of ID and it has all your information on it.
[02:35:15.769 --> 02:35:21.091]  And with these new biometric ones, it has an even greater access to that information.
[02:35:21.571 --> 02:35:24.973]  But the New York Times in general is an interesting case point.
[02:35:25.613 --> 02:35:26.974]  And by the way, did Shalibi write the...
[02:35:55.399 --> 02:35:57.622]  Graduate student article 13 years ago.
[02:35:58.143 --> 02:36:02.389]  Did he plant the fake news articles, the fake letters from troops, the false signatures?
[02:36:02.609 --> 02:36:04.272]  They're trying to scapegoat Chalimi.
[02:36:05.073 --> 02:36:06.555]  Well, I don't know, but the point is that...
[02:36:06.980 --> 02:36:19.549]  You know, New York Times, supposedly the liberal bias against the Bush administration, did in fact carry this information for 18 months, which justified his administration's and the neocons' war.
[02:36:19.809 --> 02:36:27.314]  So it's a scam that, you know, they're supposed to be the alternative, and now they're carrying editorials calling for more Big Brother, more police state.
[02:36:27.614 --> 02:36:28.695]  It says a national ID.
[02:36:30.399 --> 02:36:34.900]  The very idea of a national identity card has always rankled Americans across the political spectrum.
[02:36:34.920 --> 02:36:42.001]  It conjures images of totalitarianism, Big Brother, or even the German SS soldier asking to see a citizen's papers.
[02:36:42.041 --> 02:36:49.302]  But in most European countries, people carry national IDs as a matter of course, and pressure is mounting in America for some kind of security card.
[02:36:50.362 --> 02:36:59.644]  Private companies in the United States are already marketing the idea of providing a secure card for those willing to submit extra background checks, similar to a concept proposed by the airlines.
[02:37:00.552 --> 02:37:07.216]  Tenants of high-rise buildings or workers at chemical plants, for example, also want security without endless body searches and bag checks.
[02:37:07.276 --> 02:37:08.597]  See, oh, it makes it so convenient.
[02:37:09.097 --> 02:37:17.162]  It's time for Congress to begin a serious discussion of how to create a workable national identification system without infringing on the constitutional rights of Americans.
[02:37:17.182 --> 02:37:18.242]  Well, that's an oxymoron.
[02:37:18.662 --> 02:37:27.247]  And remember on 60 Minutes, we have a little clip of this in The Road to Tyranny, Andy Rooney says we all need a chip or something under the skin.
[02:37:27.287 --> 02:37:28.028]  This is good.
[02:37:28.448 --> 02:37:29.869]  Paul, this is completely normal.
[02:37:30.859 --> 02:37:45.725]  Well, that's why people need to stand up now against the National ID Card, because it's one step below the implantable microchip, not voluntarily or to get into a nightclub because you want to be cool, but the forced implantation for identification purposes.
[02:37:46.165 --> 02:37:50.467]  By the way, it's Newsweek this week saying the chip needs to go in you.
[02:37:50.947 --> 02:37:52.648]  Okay, so you can't laugh at us anymore.
[02:37:52.668 --> 02:37:54.749]  They're openly calling for it.
[02:37:55.149 --> 02:37:57.810]  And these yuppies, if they tell them it's cool, they'll do it.
[02:37:58.250 --> 02:37:59.371]  It's all about being cool.
[02:38:00.709 --> 02:38:14.456]  And of course they know that there's a sizable minority that will refuse to take it at all costs, and that's really who they want to have surveillance on, because the people who take the chip, obviously they're not going to be a worry to those in power.
[02:38:14.476 --> 02:38:21.039]  It's really about identifying those who... And the Jay Sekulows and the Pat Robertsons, Robertson has said the chip's a good thing.
[02:38:22.660 --> 02:38:24.501]  Well, he's obviously forgotten the Bible, then.
[02:38:27.883 --> 02:38:28.143]  Well...
[02:38:30.407 --> 02:38:38.674]  You know, looking at this New York Times article, the concept of a national ID card, on the other hand, presents a host of possible problems, not all the civil liberties.
[02:38:39.334 --> 02:38:46.060]  As the New York City Council learned tragically last year when a councilman was killed, helping get his killer around the screening point.
[02:38:46.420 --> 02:38:49.603]  The point of security is not to make sure that people are correct.
[02:38:49.623 --> 02:38:53.046]  The form of identification is to make sure that they do not have a weapon.
[02:38:54.187 --> 02:38:56.729]  So they go on to say, it's not enough.
[02:38:57.441 --> 02:39:00.743]  Then they go on to say they need to have biometrics, scans, fingerprints.
[02:39:02.264 --> 02:39:06.346]  And they're going to include in this new system what your credit rating is, Paul.
[02:39:08.268 --> 02:39:08.708]  Exactly.
[02:39:08.748 --> 02:39:15.312]  They're going to phase it in with the trusted traveler card as well, three different grades of security.
[02:39:15.692 --> 02:39:22.216]  So it's all about identifying, you know, the terrorists, and the terrorists are anyone that doesn't go along with this agenda.
[02:39:23.537 --> 02:39:23.997]  That's right.
[02:39:24.117 --> 02:39:25.398]  Most of the FBI and...
[02:39:26.107 --> 02:39:29.028]  Other secret agency training isn't for the Muslims, folks.
[02:39:29.088 --> 02:39:32.909]  It's for Christians, conservatives, land rights activists.
[02:39:32.949 --> 02:39:34.410]  That's what's really going on behind the scenes.
[02:39:34.970 --> 02:39:36.851]  Let's shift gears overseas.
[02:39:36.891 --> 02:39:43.633]  Then we'll go to Mark and Ron and John and Tim and others to take a few final calls.
[02:39:45.054 --> 02:39:48.295]  Let's get into Iraq women raped in Abu Ghraib.
[02:39:49.512 --> 02:39:54.957]  And it says, reports have emerged that Iraqi women held at notorious Abu Ghraib prison were raped both by U.S.
[02:39:55.017 --> 02:40:00.121]  and Iraqi jailers, according to a human rights group following the reports of abuse by Iraqi prisoners by U.S.
[02:40:00.141 --> 02:40:00.641]  troops there.
[02:40:01.342 --> 02:40:07.667]  However, Coalition spokesman Brigadier General Mark Kimmett said the prison's department is unaware of any such reports of Abu Ghraib.
[02:40:08.365 --> 02:40:20.055]  Well, Paul, under this article you post the MSNBC posting of Antonio Taguba's excise report, but they didn't cut out admitting raping women, beating people to death.
[02:40:20.095 --> 02:40:20.716]  Tell us about that.
[02:40:21.801 --> 02:40:22.381]  Well, exactly.
[02:40:22.801 --> 02:40:32.625]  The quote from Kimmett, you know, he basically proclaims ignorance that any rape had taken place when it's in the Tugumba official report that it had taken place.
[02:40:32.685 --> 02:40:35.106]  And that came out, you know, over a month ago now.
[02:40:35.526 --> 02:40:44.809]  And so on top of this, eyewitness, you know, personal reports from women who have now been released from that prison, which, you know, they're about to demolish, get rid of the evidence.
[02:40:45.519 --> 02:41:06.230]  And saying that they have been raped, and it's one on top of the other saying that, and so it only corroborates what we already knew, but the fact is that they're still denying that it took place, and that's probably, you know, it's a nine out of ten chance what these photos and videos show, which the senators saw, which the general public weren't allowed to view.
[02:41:06.290 --> 02:41:14.615]  They would have been these rape scenes with these women being raped, and so... And the Army's own report says 70 to 90 percent of the people...
[02:41:15.464 --> 02:41:16.945]  We're picked up at checkpoints.
[02:41:17.025 --> 02:41:23.168]  A new AP article says that not showing respect to troops would get you into the camps.
[02:41:24.188 --> 02:41:36.794]  Well, if they have a protest, if they shout anti-coalition statements, was the quote out of the AP article a few months ago, if they hold up signs, they're arrested.
[02:41:36.934 --> 02:41:40.196]  Children stealing biscuits, men selling alcohol.
[02:41:41.091 --> 02:41:48.095]  These home raids, it's come out that the troops are being ordered to steal from them, steal jewelry and money, anything that they can get their hands on.
[02:41:48.595 --> 02:41:54.559]  So it's about artificially prolonging the resentment and therefore the chaos.
[02:41:54.739 --> 02:41:55.099]  That's right.
[02:41:55.139 --> 02:41:56.219]  You got that article today.
[02:41:56.540 --> 02:41:58.261]  They're being ordered to loot them.
[02:41:58.281 --> 02:41:58.921]  Tell us about that.
[02:41:59.727 --> 02:42:01.049]  Well, yeah, it's New York Times.
[02:42:01.149 --> 02:42:14.347]  It's carried by the Indian Express, and it says that both at checkpoints and in these home raids where they go in and, you know, arrest the entire male population of a village and hold them, take them to the camp,
[02:42:14.827 --> 02:42:15.608]  We're good to go.
[02:42:32.564 --> 02:42:42.288]  And how do we know that?
[02:42:42.328 --> 02:42:46.691]  Because Rumsfeld has a $7 billion a year program, now $14 billion spent.
[02:42:47.091 --> 02:42:49.872]  P2OG, and what does P2OG call for?
[02:42:50.613 --> 02:42:59.237]  It calls for killing family members of terrorists, basically stirring up a reaction to make the terrorist attackers
[02:42:59.924 --> 02:43:04.566]  And again, with this bombing today, very suspicious, we've pointed out many times.
[02:43:04.646 --> 02:43:08.868]  Okay, let's go over that, because, I mean, you just brought it up, and I wanted to get to that next.
[02:43:09.509 --> 02:43:14.051]  There's been another bombing, this time at the Kurdish party headquarters in Baghdad.
[02:43:14.071 --> 02:43:18.753]  Then I want to get into the mass shooting and all the suspicious behavior there in Saudi Arabia.
[02:43:18.793 --> 02:43:23.295]  But first, car bomb rips through Kurdish party headquarters in Baghdad.
[02:43:24.415 --> 02:43:27.297]  Yeah, and it's killed dozens of people, and again...
[02:43:27.955 --> 02:43:36.298]  There's this giant crater with a lot of the previous bombings that we've pointed out that eyewitnesses report missiles fired from Apache helicopters.
[02:43:36.318 --> 02:43:38.099]  And we're not just talking about Muslims saying this.
[02:43:38.119 --> 02:43:41.080]  We're talking about accredited Western journalists.
[02:43:42.111 --> 02:43:51.353]  And, you know, I'm not an explosives expert or anything, but, you know, a car bomb, when it detonates, doesn't it seek the least possible direction of resistance, which is up and to the sides?
[02:43:51.793 --> 02:44:05.477]  Obviously, you know, there'd be a small crater, but when you tie it in with the fact that these craters are described as huge and then accompany it with the multiple eyewitness reports of helicopter missiles attacks, then who exactly is carrying out some of these bombings?
[02:44:07.176 --> 02:44:07.636]  That's right.
[02:44:07.696 --> 02:44:14.419]  Anybody who was appointed to the 300-plus member puppet dictatorship who hasn't followed orders suddenly gets bombed.
[02:44:14.820 --> 02:44:19.282]  Al-Qaeda's out killing the people that are not going along with America.
[02:44:19.302 --> 02:44:20.742]  Oh, that makes a lot of sense, Paul.
[02:44:21.503 --> 02:44:27.926]  And then their replacements are men that formerly worked with both MI6 and the CIA, just by coincidence.
[02:44:27.946 --> 02:44:30.447]  Yeah, they're now appointing the second government.
[02:44:30.467 --> 02:44:31.307]  Again, no election.
[02:44:31.327 --> 02:44:35.930]  They're appointing a second government, and they have massive CIA-MI6 connections.
[02:44:35.970 --> 02:44:36.510]  Tell us about it.
[02:44:37.443 --> 02:44:53.608]  Well, yeah, it's a guy called Alawi who they're putting in as the Prime Minister and he had, when they were fighting Saddam after, you know, he'd been our ally and then our enemy and then our ally again, he was supposedly expelled and he was communicating with the CIA.
[02:44:53.648 --> 02:44:55.809]  They were giving him access to their technology.
[02:44:57.081 --> 02:44:58.482]  To fight Saddam Hussein.
[02:44:58.522 --> 02:45:00.083]  So he worked with the CIA.
[02:45:00.123 --> 02:45:09.552]  The Independent report a few days ago also said that he had similar liaisons with MI6, which is the British CIA.
[02:45:10.272 --> 02:45:17.499]  And so basically, again, he's their guy and he will go into their government, which has no authority to make any law, no authority to...
[02:45:18.844 --> 02:45:35.751]  Now the situation in Saudi Arabia in this upscaled area in Kobar, these government go in and shoot and kill just a mass of people and then the Saudis let them go.
[02:45:36.992 --> 02:45:42.474]  Yeah, the situation is that three of them escaped with hostages and now the government
[02:45:43.414 --> 02:45:49.060]  Especially the British government is fear-mongering about how there's going to be another imminent attack in Saudi Arabia.
[02:45:50.461 --> 02:45:56.607]  But the Saudis said six months ago that it's the British government doing it to destabilize Saudi Arabia.
[02:45:57.888 --> 02:45:58.429]  Well, yeah.
[02:45:58.489 --> 02:46:04.174]  I was watching CNN International, which is a different setup to the American CNN.
[02:46:04.214 --> 02:46:05.616]  It's a different feed.
[02:46:06.198 --> 02:46:34.382]  And the House was basically giving credence to the conspiracy that this attack was carried out in cooperation with some elements of the military or the government there because the so-called Al-Qaeda group were wearing military uniforms and their exit from the compound was initially described as an escape by the media but the reports soon changed to the fact that they had cut a deal with the government who had allowed them to go free.
[02:46:34.802 --> 02:46:36.023]  Okay, let's take some calls.
[02:46:36.043 --> 02:46:38.064]  Then we'll hit some other final news.
[02:46:38.104 --> 02:46:38.965]  There's a lot of it here.
[02:46:39.285 --> 02:46:40.025]  Quickly, callers.
[02:46:40.526 --> 02:46:41.966]  Mark in Kansas, go ahead.
[02:46:42.407 --> 02:46:43.627]  Yeah, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:46:43.647 --> 02:46:44.648]  Thanks for everything you do.
[02:46:44.928 --> 02:46:45.268]  Thank you.
[02:46:45.689 --> 02:46:52.813]  I was turning a tag in today at the Driver's License Bureau, and I saw the ladies taking a picture of a man to get it on his driver's license.
[02:46:53.613 --> 02:46:57.056]  And on our computer screen, they showed the left eye, and then they showed the right eye.
[02:46:57.696 --> 02:47:00.978]  This guy left, and I asked that lady... Yeah, those digital photos are a face scan.
[02:47:01.519 --> 02:47:07.042]  Yeah, I asked her, and I guess Kansas has implemented an actual retinal scan for our drivers.
[02:47:07.062 --> 02:47:08.823]  No, the digital photo does it, yes.
[02:47:09.164 --> 02:47:10.064]  Yeah.
[02:47:10.184 --> 02:47:12.065]  Forty-two states, last time I checked.
[02:47:12.366 --> 02:47:17.649]  Oh, my wife said she read an article in Kansas and was one of the first, but anyway, I was just amazed.
[02:47:17.709 --> 02:47:20.250]  I hope that wakes some people up in Kansas about what's going on.
[02:47:20.911 --> 02:47:24.073]  They've been digitally scanning in Texas since 1993.
[02:47:24.793 --> 02:47:26.114]  Wow, it's getting bad.
[02:47:26.654 --> 02:47:28.675]  I wanted to ask you, too, about the America First Party.
[02:47:28.715 --> 02:47:29.676]  Do you know anything about them?
[02:47:30.597 --> 02:47:31.197]  Not really.
[02:47:31.818 --> 02:47:32.799]  Just sent me some literature.
[02:47:32.859 --> 02:47:38.202]  My dad was a big Pat Buchanan fan, and I think he's kind of pushing this or behind it.
[02:47:38.242 --> 02:47:45.507]  I'm not sure, but they were for closing the borders, keeping the jobs here in America first, and I just wondered if you'd heard anything about them.
[02:47:45.708 --> 02:47:46.688]  I have heard a little bit.
[02:47:46.788 --> 02:47:48.690]  I'm not a big expert on it, though.
[02:47:49.090 --> 02:47:49.530]  Oh, okay.
[02:47:49.890 --> 02:47:51.051]  Well, I appreciate you taking my call.
[02:47:51.191 --> 02:47:52.812]  Thank you, Mark.
[02:47:52.852 --> 02:47:53.593]  You made us think.
[02:47:53.613 --> 02:47:55.374]  Let's talk to Ron in Colorado.
[02:47:55.414 --> 02:47:56.155]  Ron, go ahead.
[02:47:56.755 --> 02:47:57.415]  Yes, Alex.
[02:47:57.435 --> 02:47:57.756]  Hello.
[02:47:57.956 --> 02:47:58.196]  Hello.
[02:47:58.972 --> 02:48:03.155]  There's a new website, and it shows WTC 911.
[02:48:03.796 --> 02:48:08.099]  It shows a missile coming out of the second plane when it hits the tower.
[02:48:08.159 --> 02:48:12.301]  Yeah, Paul put that in his book a year ago and broke that on his website a year ago.
[02:48:13.082 --> 02:48:14.743]  Not the first plane, but the second plane, the 767.
[02:48:16.004 --> 02:48:17.965]  We put a link to that over the weekend.
[02:48:18.246 --> 02:48:18.586]  Okay.
[02:48:18.726 --> 02:48:19.747]  Can I get the website out?
[02:48:19.767 --> 02:48:20.347]  Sure, go ahead.
[02:48:20.767 --> 02:48:22.028]  It's letsroll911.org.
[02:48:22.148 --> 02:48:27.192]  Yeah, Paul, why don't you fill him in on all this?
[02:48:28.303 --> 02:48:31.204]  Yeah, basically that's exactly what it shows.
[02:48:31.224 --> 02:48:42.347]  You take, and I noticed this before I wrote my book, both Flight 11, Flight 175, immediately before they hit the towers, there is a flash from the underbelly of the plane.
[02:48:42.467 --> 02:48:47.129]  And there's this pod, and again, sir, we have reports going back a year and a half on that on the website.
[02:48:47.489 --> 02:48:48.149]  Okay, very good.
[02:48:48.189 --> 02:48:50.329]  We need to put a link on the main page of that, Paul.
[02:48:50.369 --> 02:48:52.030]  How do folks find all our reports on that?
[02:48:53.228 --> 02:48:56.509]  Well, they'll be going in the archives, the September 11 archive, very shortly.
[02:48:56.529 --> 02:49:07.213]  We're actually creating a new section on that which solely focuses on things like the pod issue and the mystery of Flight 93.
[02:49:07.293 --> 02:49:09.714]  So there's going to be several new sections on that.
[02:49:09.794 --> 02:49:10.214]  Okay.
[02:49:10.674 --> 02:49:11.454]  Anything else, sir?
[02:49:11.754 --> 02:49:14.375]  No, I just wanted to draw your attention to that direct evidence.
[02:49:14.775 --> 02:49:15.115]  Okay.
[02:49:15.135 --> 02:49:16.076]  Well, we are aware of it.
[02:49:16.116 --> 02:49:16.476]  Thank you.
[02:49:16.496 --> 02:49:18.917]  Let's talk to John in Colorado.
[02:49:18.957 --> 02:49:19.817]  John, go ahead.
[02:49:20.177 --> 02:49:22.818]  Yes, gentlemen, thank you for taking my call.
[02:49:22.858 --> 02:49:25.520]  Very quickly, I'm bringing two points together into one.
[02:49:25.880 --> 02:49:31.323]  We have the G8 meeting off Georgia on an island that's going to take place for at least three weeks.
[02:49:31.563 --> 02:49:36.086]  We have several carriers leaving Stateside Harbor going out to sea.
[02:49:36.406 --> 02:49:39.047]  They also have to be out there for at least three weeks.
[02:49:39.187 --> 02:49:40.148]  Why three weeks?
[02:49:40.668 --> 02:49:46.311]  Because they're going to both have an observance, a satanic observance of two holidays.
[02:49:46.994 --> 02:49:48.915]  One coming up this Sunday, which is June 6, 2004.
[02:49:49.015 --> 02:49:50.075]  That's 666 and 999 combined.
[02:49:50.095 --> 02:49:50.916]  999 means 999 days after September 11, 2001.
[02:49:50.976 --> 02:49:53.517]  So that's a double observance on that day.
[02:49:53.537 --> 02:49:56.298]  The other one is the summer solstice day, June 21st.
[02:50:07.116 --> 02:50:08.357]  Well, they have to have these meetings going on.
[02:50:08.397 --> 02:50:12.700]  Well, we noticed the Madrid bombing happened 911 days after 9-11 on 3-11.
[02:50:12.900 --> 02:50:14.281]  They are obsessed with neurology.
[02:50:14.321 --> 02:50:16.963]  The meeting, the G8 meeting is not three weeks.
[02:50:17.043 --> 02:50:17.824]  It is two days.
[02:50:18.324 --> 02:50:23.648]  Well, they're going to be there at least three weeks because they're going to observe us.
[02:50:23.748 --> 02:50:25.389]  But the meeting's going on for two days.
[02:50:26.070 --> 02:50:28.311]  And they've declared martial law in Georgia.
[02:50:28.571 --> 02:50:31.854]  Yeah, but did you notice the guy said they're going to be out there for a couple weeks?
[02:50:32.935 --> 02:50:35.076]  Well, not according to the Associated Press.
[02:50:35.096 --> 02:50:36.117]  The meeting is two days.
[02:50:36.137 --> 02:50:36.337]  Okay.
[02:50:37.125 --> 02:50:38.766]  I tell you what, we'll come back to the final segment.
[02:50:38.786 --> 02:50:39.586]  Thanks for the call, John.
[02:50:39.626 --> 02:50:40.186]  Interesting info.
[02:50:40.206 --> 02:50:40.987]  We'll talk to Tim.
[02:50:41.267 --> 02:50:42.367]  Hit a few final news stories.
[02:50:42.387 --> 02:50:44.428]  Stay with us.
[02:50:44.809 --> 02:50:53.873]  Herbal Healer Academy is the global supplier of the finest natural medicine that you may need in these troubled times.
[02:50:54.113 --> 02:50:56.374]  We specialize in keeping you alive and healthy.

[02:51:03.917 --> 02:51:04.218]  I think?
[02:51:32.774 --> 02:51:35.856]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:36.016 --> 02:51:41.980]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:45.543 --> 02:51:49.826]  Alex Jones here announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:51:50.066 --> 02:51:54.389]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:51:56.411 --> 02:51:59.013]  To use this disaster as a new world order.
[02:51:59.113 --> 02:52:01.915]  A new world order can emerge.
[02:52:02.195 --> 02:52:06.418]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:52:06.478 --> 02:52:13.403]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:52:13.523 --> 02:52:15.545]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:52:15.785 --> 02:52:26.227]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:52:26.527 --> 02:52:31.868]  If you want to understand what the new world order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[02:52:32.408 --> 02:52:35.048]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.

[02:52:44.870 --> 02:52:53.135]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water, and did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[02:52:53.375 --> 02:52:57.757]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[02:52:58.037 --> 02:53:06.962]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[02:53:07.162 --> 02:53:10.784]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[02:53:11.064 --> 02:53:16.089]  The KDF shower filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[02:53:16.390 --> 02:53:23.097]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[02:53:23.607 --> 02:53:24.248]  What about you?
[02:53:24.908 --> 02:53:30.272]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[02:53:49.039 --> 02:53:55.042]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:53:55.662 --> 02:53:58.684]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:54:01.045 --> 02:54:03.366]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:54:05.147 --> 02:54:08.848]  On personpilot.com, we have the fake terror alert section.
[02:54:10.729 --> 02:54:13.391]  And Ashcroft and Ridge and others have been out fear-mongering now.
[02:54:13.431 --> 02:54:14.671]  Gary Hart is as well.
[02:54:14.691 --> 02:54:18.333]  I want to go back over this and mention smart bullets here in a second.
[02:54:19.421 --> 02:54:22.702]  But, Paul, before we do that, presentplanet.tv.
[02:54:22.722 --> 02:54:34.844]  Again, we have incredible bandwidth prices, costs that we go through with the now five websites that I have, the 20-plus million visitors a month that we deal with.
[02:54:35.424 --> 02:54:45.446]  And so people want my weekly TV report uploaded each week to the website if they want the best audio interviews, the text reports, the special reports, all of it.
[02:54:45.526 --> 02:54:46.207]  It's $0.15 a day, $0.19 a week.
[02:54:48.694 --> 02:54:52.477]  A day if you buy a month at a time, 15 cents a day if you buy a year subscription.
[02:54:52.497 --> 02:54:54.539]  A lot of people are excited about it.
[02:54:54.599 --> 02:54:56.440]  We appreciate your membership, your support.
[02:54:56.760 --> 02:55:00.363]  But if you haven't signed up to presentplanet.tv, Paul, why should they?
[02:55:01.508 --> 02:55:10.231]  Because it's $5.95 a month, which if you think about it, for what you can buy for that, and for the service that you will be getting, it's excellent value for money.
[02:55:10.811 --> 02:55:18.173]  And obviously it supports us, because if we just made the video available for everybody, then it would cripple us financially.
[02:55:18.233 --> 02:55:18.953]  Well, I did that.
[02:55:19.093 --> 02:55:31.117]  I mean, I literally, and we still put a lot of video out and audio out for free, but we have to somehow subsidize that, and people get this special access, privileged access, all of it by doing this.
[02:55:31.969 --> 02:55:40.598]  Well, yeah, and the point is that a lot of it is still free, and that's indicated on the website, but the weekly video report, which is excellent, is the mini-documentary within itself.
[02:55:41.178 --> 02:55:52.530]  And, of course, all of your previous documentaries in full format are available now, and they can go and sign up with either credit card or PayPal by clicking on the subscribe button right at the top of the page.
[02:55:53.030 --> 02:55:53.450]  That's right.
[02:55:53.490 --> 02:55:57.351]  And folks, if you want to buy a VHS or DVD of my videos, I've made 10 films.
[02:55:57.391 --> 02:56:00.472]  I carry a bunch of other great videos and books and books on tape.
[02:56:00.512 --> 02:56:06.553]  And I'm not trying to toot our own horn here, but Paul broke the news over a year and a half ago of the missile pods and the rest of it.
[02:56:06.613 --> 02:56:09.854]  And it was in his book, put out, coming up on a year.
[02:56:10.534 --> 02:56:12.934]  And that's just one of the reports we put out.
[02:56:12.974 --> 02:56:15.875]  That's a small chapter, part of a chapter in his book.
[02:56:17.036 --> 02:56:20.960]  Order Out of Chaos, Elite Sponsored Terror in the New World Order, over 300 pages, $19.95.
[02:56:21.520 --> 02:56:24.843]  Get a second copy for $12.95 when you do that.
[02:56:25.524 --> 02:56:27.846]  If you buy one copy, get the second for $12, $11.95 to give as a gift.
[02:56:27.866 --> 02:56:29.568]  Toll-free number to order the videos of the books, 1-888-253-3139.
[02:56:29.588 --> 02:56:32.871]  Pick up the phone, make the call, get the videos, get the books, start exposing the killers.
[02:56:41.659 --> 02:56:44.180]  Or they're going to keep tearing out terror to scare you into submission.
[02:56:44.200 --> 02:56:44.841]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:56:44.861 --> 02:56:49.183]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 78704.
[02:56:49.223 --> 02:56:51.204]  My videos are $25.95 apiece, all over two hours long.
[02:56:51.224 --> 02:56:52.004]  $20 when you order three or more.
[02:57:03.470 --> 02:57:07.776]  Paul, Ashcroft warns of attack, some question threat and its timing.
[02:57:08.277 --> 02:57:13.764]  Even the globalist New York Times had to admit this looks like it's staged, but I wouldn't say that.
[02:57:13.825 --> 02:57:15.046]  They could really pull something.
[02:57:15.407 --> 02:57:20.193]  Also, a warning or a threat, Gary Hart says Heartland is the target and is going to get hit.
[02:57:20.253 --> 02:57:20.474]  Paul?
[02:57:21.232 --> 02:57:32.245]  Well, the thing with the Ashcroft terror alert is that the so-called ringleaders of the cell, one of them, Amer Almaty, he's in jail, according to a security website.
[02:57:32.305 --> 02:57:38.011]  Another one, Afia Siddiqui, was arrested in Pakistan over a year ago, according to NBC.
[02:57:38.412 --> 02:57:41.976]  And the cell that is named Abu Hafs Almazri...
[02:57:42.456 --> 02:57:54.188]  Was described by the Boston Globe as a phantom organization because it was immediately linked to the Madrid bombings, but then they did the investigation and they could find no evidence that the group even existed.
[02:57:55.285 --> 02:58:05.053]  So, on top of that, the New York City and Los Angeles officials told Reuters that they had not been informed of any terror threat from the government.
[02:58:05.213 --> 02:58:10.017]  So they're not even being informed of it because it's based on phony, manufactured information.
[02:58:10.357 --> 02:58:17.923]  And I saw Governor Ridge say that it's all an art form, these alerts, but a year ago the White House press secretary admitted that it was being done for political reasons.
[02:58:18.644 --> 02:58:21.685]  Yeah, and that was Ari Fleischer, and that was also in the Washington Times.
[02:58:21.725 --> 02:58:26.386]  They put out the alert when all the bad 9-11 news broke to try and distract.
[02:58:27.447 --> 02:58:27.967]  That's right.
[02:58:28.047 --> 02:58:29.387]  Think for yourselves out there.
[02:58:29.427 --> 02:58:30.508]  Thanks, Paul, for joining us.
