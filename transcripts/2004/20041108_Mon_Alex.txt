[00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:09.774]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:10.394 --> 00:00:11.234]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:12.855]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:17.196]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:21.838]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:36.721 --> 00:00:39.444]  Our society speeds up more and more.
[00:00:40.064 --> 00:00:45.189]  People are running around frantic in all directions because life has gotten so complex.
[00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:59.302]  Some of this is by government social architect design, but some of it is just a byproduct of the society that we ourselves have built by the decisions that we all make.
[00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.932]  And the news overload is just getting unbelievable.
[00:01:05.092 --> 00:01:10.835]  I literally have 150 news stories in front of me.
[00:01:11.095 --> 00:01:13.757]  Every one of them I could spend an hour on.
[00:01:15.318 --> 00:01:20.541]  If I was going to give it justice and dissect it and analyze it and get your comments on it.
[00:01:20.981 --> 00:01:26.124]  We've got the battle for Fallujah going on and everything's swirling around that.
[00:01:26.384 --> 00:01:30.386]  Holy War, Evangelical Marines prepare for battle openly.
[00:01:31.863 --> 00:01:40.467]  The Muslims are over there praying to their God, and the Christians are praying to theirs, and this is being broadcast around the world to hype up religious war.
[00:01:41.707 --> 00:01:56.273]  Meanwhile, Japan, this is from their own major publications as well as the communist publications in China, Japan's defense agency sets three scenarios of China attack to attack China.
[00:01:57.896 --> 00:02:02.178]  Also, Terror Watch site says Al Jazeera won't air new Bin Laden tape.
[00:02:03.059 --> 00:02:08.301]  Melton's website comment, the Bin Laden tape, where he says, how dare you not vote for Kerry.
[00:02:08.601 --> 00:02:10.862]  I mean, who really believes that's Bin Laden?
[00:02:11.543 --> 00:02:16.845]  I know you believe Steve McQueen's really back out pitching Mustangs and other Ford products.
[00:02:16.905 --> 00:02:19.307]  No, he's been dead since 1980.
[00:02:19.947 --> 00:02:24.129]  And it's a similar story with, uh, from all the evidence we have of Bin Laden.
[00:02:25.592 --> 00:02:27.614]  Article here out of USA Today.
[00:02:27.634 --> 00:02:31.137]  This is the paper they use to tell the general public how they're slaves.
[00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:34.760]  CIA role inside the United States.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:37.382]  They're going to fight terror and crime.
[00:02:39.564 --> 00:02:40.145]  Amazing.
[00:02:40.785 --> 00:02:49.052]  Also, Canada, New Zealand, Australia are all reporting record numbers of U.S.
[00:02:49.112 --> 00:02:51.134]  citizens wanting to leave the country.
[00:02:53.268 --> 00:02:57.971]  What, you want to jump out of the frying pan into the oven or out of the oven into the furnace?
[00:02:59.332 --> 00:03:07.578]  And a young man went and committed suicide at Ground Zero in New York, protesting President Bush being re-elected.
[00:03:07.618 --> 00:03:11.040]  I mean, I can't imagine somebody killing themselves for a more stupid reason.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.382]  I'm really sad for this young man's family.
[00:03:14.202 --> 00:03:16.104]  Don't you know it was all staged?
[00:03:16.144 --> 00:03:18.385]  That Kerry was for all the same policies?
[00:03:19.246 --> 00:03:22.348]  Except for maybe some distractionary issue.
[00:03:23.425 --> 00:03:25.847]  Diversionary issue like gay marriage.
[00:03:25.907 --> 00:03:30.890]  I'm not saying that issue is important, but to the globalists it was a distraction from all the other issues.
[00:03:31.191 --> 00:03:32.752]  They used it as a political football.
[00:03:33.552 --> 00:03:36.755]  I mean, there's really no difference between Bush and Kerry on key issues.
[00:03:37.155 --> 00:03:39.336]  And this poor guy went and committed suicide there.
[00:03:39.376 --> 00:03:44.200]  We'll be talking about that also, the Boston newspaper.
[00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:51.145]  Will the chip advance civilization, it says, or will it dehumanize humanity?
[00:03:52.458 --> 00:03:54.680]  School backpacks getting their trackable chips.
[00:03:55.321 --> 00:03:58.324]  Google censors Abu Ghraib torture images.
[00:03:59.084 --> 00:03:59.945]  Shame on Google.
[00:04:01.286 --> 00:04:07.732]  Moron under the hood Big Brother systems that are in all your new cars now that nobody wanted to tell you about while they were putting them in.
[00:04:07.752 --> 00:04:12.416]  And this Chuck Baldwin editorial from last Friday I didn't have time to get to.
[00:04:12.497 --> 00:04:13.618]  I want to today.
[00:04:14.018 --> 00:04:18.202]  Christians and conservatives can go back to sleep now because the boogeyman is gone.
[00:04:19.218 --> 00:04:25.542]  That's the Constitution Party's VP, good friend of the program, and writes great stories weekly.
[00:04:25.562 --> 00:04:26.662]  We'll be reading that.
[00:04:27.603 --> 00:04:43.912]  Also, there's another article here I want to go over by Kaminsky talking about the election and why are the Democrats pulling their hair out?
[00:04:45.073 --> 00:04:47.434]  And look at what Bush's cousin did, didn't even contest it.
[00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.232]  Folks, this is only the tip of the iceberg.
[00:04:50.272 --> 00:04:54.757]  There is so much, so much coming up today.
[00:04:54.777 --> 00:04:56.178]  You do not want to miss it.
[00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:57.960]  The website is sinfulwars.com.
[00:05:03.524 --> 00:05:09.009]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.994]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[00:05:14.114 --> 00:05:20.961]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:05:21.321 --> 00:05:27.427]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:05:27.447 --> 00:05:28.788]  There are no side effects.
[00:05:29.128 --> 00:05:32.072]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:05:32.232 --> 00:05:34.254]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[00:05:34.555 --> 00:05:41.803]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[00:05:42.104 --> 00:05:45.468]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.
[00:05:45.908 --> 00:05:49.052]  For more information, call Alternative Technologies toll-free.
[00:05:49.072 --> 00:05:49.152]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.172 --> 00:05:49.213]  866-885-6625.
[00:05:49.393 --> 00:05:50.254]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:05:50.314 --> 00:05:50.554]  Call today.
[00:06:00.962 --> 00:06:02.563]  Hello, folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:06:02.924 --> 00:06:08.668]  You know that Berkey water filters have become the standard of excellence by which all other water filtration systems are measured.
[00:06:08.928 --> 00:06:14.072]  The Berkey Light gives you the freshest, cleanest water possible from the world's most revolutionary water filtration system.
[00:06:14.412 --> 00:06:23.679]  The self-sterilizing black Berkey elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, volatile organic chemicals, dried halomethanes, radon-222, and much, much more.
[00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:28.980]  It's rechargeable 8-lamp bright white LED lighting system provides the ideal source of emergency light.
[00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:33.321]  The lights can run all night on a single charge and it is bright enough to read by.
[00:06:33.521 --> 00:06:38.282]  This provides a relaxing and ambient night light that allows for optimum use during emergency conditions.
[00:06:38.703 --> 00:06:44.564]  Emergency Light's revolutionary transparent design takes the guesswork out of refilling because you can see the water level at all times.
[00:06:44.864 --> 00:06:47.645]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:06:47.685 --> 00:06:51.987]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[00:07:11.681 --> 00:07:14.323]  To use this disaster with a new world order.
[00:07:14.403 --> 00:07:15.763]  A new world order?
[00:07:16.444 --> 00:07:17.444]  Can it emerge?
[00:07:17.484 --> 00:07:21.727]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[00:07:21.767 --> 00:07:28.711]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[00:07:28.831 --> 00:07:30.832]  You will lose your liberty.
[00:07:31.072 --> 00:07:41.656]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[00:07:41.836 --> 00:07:47.238]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[00:07:47.698 --> 00:07:50.920]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.460]  That's 888-253-3139.
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.760]  Order today and spread the word!
[00:08:05.572 --> 00:08:09.754]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover Ups.
[00:08:10.414 --> 00:08:11.254]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.995 --> 00:08:12.855]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.555 --> 00:08:17.237]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.737 --> 00:08:21.899]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:33.864]  Hey, global government is upon us.
[00:08:34.793 --> 00:08:45.738]  And so that we do not struggle out of the grasp, the clutches of this diabolical system, the New World Order gives you a false left-right choice.
[00:08:46.298 --> 00:08:48.819]  Evil America versus the loving good UN.
[00:08:49.179 --> 00:08:53.281]  Or if you're an American, good America versus the evil UN.
[00:08:54.641 --> 00:08:56.682]  Or Republican versus a Democrat.
[00:08:57.643 --> 00:09:00.804]  When in reality the policies are almost identical.
[00:09:02.865 --> 00:09:17.084]  As the police state and the formation of a cashless society control grid goes into place, there's no debate between the parties, between Americans and Europeans, between Tories and Labor and Republicans and Democrats on that.
[00:09:20.353 --> 00:09:32.841]  And so by having false choices they make most people fall into the control of this system and thus our journey towards slavery is complete until we wake up to this false left-right paradigm.
[00:09:34.122 --> 00:09:39.545]  Well our government told Iraqi civilians to flee the rebel city of Fallujah last Friday.
[00:09:39.565 --> 00:09:45.929]  That was kind of hard to do because I have the other Pentagon reports where they would not allow people to leave the city.
[00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:49.672]  They locked down the city and locked down the borders of Iraq itself.
[00:09:52.979 --> 00:09:56.181]  And meanwhile, Iraq rebels struck before U.S.
[00:09:56.241 --> 00:10:00.364]  attack over the weekend and went in and took over different types of facilities.
[00:10:00.424 --> 00:10:07.049]  Rebels shot dead 21 Iraqi policemen in cold blood on Sunday, a day after killing 34 people in attacks on security forces.
[00:10:07.469 --> 00:10:10.631]  And a clear show of force ahead of the imminent U.S.
[00:10:10.691 --> 00:10:13.653]  offensive on insurgents in Fallujah and Ramadi.
[00:10:15.995 --> 00:10:20.398]  Meanwhile, they keep saying that the government of Iraq has declared martial law.
[00:10:21.796 --> 00:10:23.877]  or a civil emergency.
[00:10:23.957 --> 00:10:32.699]  But again, it's a puppet government installed and now they've sent our soldiers into the city.
[00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:33.420]  U.S.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.760]  soldiers stormed part of Fallujah today.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:36.501]  U.S.
[00:10:36.541 --> 00:10:51.145]  forces stormed into the western outskirts of Fallujah early Monday, seizing the main city hospital and securing two key bridges over the Euphrates River in what appears to be the first stage of a long-expected assault on the insurgent stronghold.
[00:10:51.795 --> 00:10:58.663]  Where they had two months to dig in because Bush ordered the Pentagon not to attack until after the election, which will make it four times harder.
[00:10:59.304 --> 00:11:00.485]  That's the estimate of the Pentagon.
[00:11:01.406 --> 00:11:05.711]  An AC-130 gunship raped the city with 40mm cannon fire.
[00:11:05.871 --> 00:11:07.313]  Oh, very precision guided.
[00:11:07.934 --> 00:11:10.457]  And explosions from US artillery lit up the night sky.
[00:11:10.497 --> 00:11:12.439]  They're just turning the place into mincemeat.
[00:11:13.817 --> 00:11:22.183]  Intermittent artillery fire blasted southern and northern neighborhoods of Fallujah, and orange fireballs from high-explosive airbursts could be seen above the rooftops.
[00:11:23.264 --> 00:11:32.651]  All that's going to happen is insurgents are going to dig in in the basements, it's going to kill a bunch of civilians, and when our troops roll in, they'll be ten times the opposition.
[00:11:33.191 --> 00:11:42.118]  And that's what all the former Special Forces Chiefs are saying, that's what troops in country, officers are leaking out to people, some of them are publicly saying it and getting arrested.
[00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:45.532]  This is not going to work, and it's not meant to work, folks.
[00:11:45.592 --> 00:11:52.557]  It's meant to keep the war going on under the Pentagon plan, P-2-O-G, to actually create more opposition, just like Vietnam.
[00:11:53.538 --> 00:12:00.803]  We've got to win the hearts and minds of these people, and for every insurgent they kill, they estimate five new insurgents are created.
[00:12:02.244 --> 00:12:03.265]  Hey, bring them on, though!
[00:12:03.625 --> 00:12:08.689]  You're a chicken hawk who dodged the draft and ran off with a deferment with a silver spoon in your mouth.
[00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.312]  It's a great American tradition, like Bill Clinton and the rest of them.
[00:12:13.235 --> 00:12:13.856]  Then so what?
[00:12:13.896 --> 00:12:14.416]  Bring them on!
[00:12:15.857 --> 00:12:16.277]  So U.S.
[00:12:16.317 --> 00:12:17.598]  soldiers stormed part of Fallujah.
[00:12:17.638 --> 00:12:26.225]  They have photos here out of the Washington Post, AP photos, with the soldiers writing out their last letters home in case they die.
[00:12:28.326 --> 00:12:32.450]  It's just amazing to see this happening.
[00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:35.712]  But they're calling it a state of emergency in Iraq.
[00:12:36.032 --> 00:12:36.953]  Borders closed.
[00:12:37.033 --> 00:12:39.315]  Iraqi Prime Minister, Ayd Al-Ayi,
[00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:45.633]  announced today a state of emergency in certain parts of the country including the closure of borders in Baghdad Airport.
[00:12:46.013 --> 00:12:54.958]  Alawi told a news conference Baghdad International Airport would be closed for 48 hours and the borders with Syria and Jordan would be closed until further notice except for trucks carrying food.
[00:12:56.779 --> 00:13:01.081]  He also announced a curfew in Fallujah and Ramadi for 24 hours beginning at 7 p.m.
[00:13:01.121 --> 00:13:07.505]  except for medical and rescue teams and employees in basic services such as bakeries and water and electricity companies.
[00:13:08.149 --> 00:13:13.974]  And I've got stacks of reports of water workers, people out driving trash trucks.
[00:13:14.315 --> 00:13:15.776]  Our troops don't like the looks of them.
[00:13:16.197 --> 00:13:19.520]  They just blow the trash trucks up and then somebody's injured, begging for their lives.
[00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:22.062]  Our troops walk right over and blow their heads off.
[00:13:22.582 --> 00:13:25.845]  And a lot of neocon sickos go, yeah, yeah, kill them all, kill them, kill them.
[00:13:26.126 --> 00:13:27.907]  Folks, we went in and took over this country.
[00:13:28.448 --> 00:13:30.490]  They're not all enemies of the globalists.
[00:13:30.510 --> 00:13:32.792]  A lot of them want to submit, want to be slaves.
[00:13:34.368 --> 00:13:39.791]  And the insurgents, you know, most of them were people who were basically on our government's side until they saw the tyranny.
[00:13:41.152 --> 00:13:46.216]  So again, I mean, I hear these bloodthirsty psychopaths going, nuke, nuke the whole country, kill them all, kill them.
[00:13:46.456 --> 00:13:48.677]  So what if we rape and kill?
[00:13:48.757 --> 00:13:49.358]  It's a war.
[00:13:50.098 --> 00:13:52.320]  But I thought Saddam was bad because he raped and killed.
[00:13:54.401 --> 00:13:55.122]  Just amazing.
[00:13:55.542 --> 00:13:59.905]  So we have that state of emergency going on over there right now and I'll
[00:14:01.055 --> 00:14:02.696]  I'll get more into this a little bit later.
[00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:11.782]  Some other news items that I wanted to cover here are also of great import.
[00:14:11.882 --> 00:14:15.104]  I mean, this just illustrates what your neocons are doing to you.
[00:14:16.445 --> 00:14:18.646]  This just shows what they're really all about.
[00:14:20.587 --> 00:14:24.490]  Abortion remark by GOP Senator puts heat on peers.
[00:14:26.624 --> 00:14:27.824]  This is last Friday.
[00:14:28.165 --> 00:14:43.729]  Angry conservatives flooded Senate phone and fax lines on Friday demanding that Republicans prevent Senator Arlen Specter from presiding over the Judiciary Committee after he remarked that strongly anti-abortion judicial nominees might be rejected in the Senate.
[00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:51.672]  Republican lawmakers and top Senate aides, speaking privately for the most part, said that the uproar from the right was becoming an immediate
[00:14:52.846 --> 00:14:59.808]  Um, problem for Mr. Specter, a Pennsylvania lawmaker, who was coveted the chairmanship.
[00:14:59.868 --> 00:15:04.229]  They said while it was likely he would still get the post, it is no longer a certainty.
[00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:17.573]  He's not out of the woods, said one Senate aide who was closely monitoring developments on the Judiciary Committee, echoing a statement and sentiment expressed by Republican senators and other party officials.
[00:15:18.371 --> 00:15:24.476]  Most of Republicans said they initially believed that Mr. Spector's subsequent clarification would protect him.
[00:15:24.816 --> 00:15:28.179]  Mr. Spector said he did not mean his remarks as a warning to Mr. Bush.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:37.306]  Bush not to nominate the Supreme Court a judge who would not be inclined to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision which legalized abortion.
[00:15:38.263 --> 00:15:50.327]  But the Republican officials said that the continuing resistance to his taking the chairmanship of the committee that examined judicial nominees was being fanned by conservative talk radio hosts and groups outraged over his comments.
[00:15:51.488 --> 00:15:58.410]  And then one lawmaker, one senator, told the New York Times that, well, we've got to stand strong and show these people that they're not the boss.
[00:16:01.572 --> 00:16:07.994]  Now, it goes on to admit that Arlen Specter is pro-abortion, that Arlen Specter is against nominees that are anti-abortion.
[00:16:09.247 --> 00:16:12.508]  And that Bush is pushing to make him the chairman of this committee.
[00:16:15.228 --> 00:16:16.128]  But here's the problem.
[00:16:19.769 --> 00:16:29.651]  Neocon followers don't understand that Bush is pro-open border, pro-gun control, pro-UNESCO, increased abortion funding.
[00:16:29.831 --> 00:16:30.611]  Let's just admit it.
[00:16:32.632 --> 00:16:38.813]  And that he did nothing to stop the wholesale slaughter of millions of children a year in this country.
[00:16:41.989 --> 00:16:42.329]  Nothing!
[00:16:44.091 --> 00:16:46.153]  And I don't want to hear that Bush can't do anything.
[00:16:46.193 --> 00:16:57.523]  They have control of the House, the Senate, so that's the Legislative, they have the Judiciary, the Supreme Court, and most of the State Courts, and most of the Federal Courts, 30 plus State Governors, and they have the Executive.
[00:16:57.563 --> 00:16:58.363]  They've got it all.
[00:16:58.403 --> 00:17:01.786]  They even got more seats in the Senate, more seats in the House.
[00:17:02.587 --> 00:17:06.771]  And instead of Bush repudiating Arlen Specter, this neocon chieftain,
[00:17:07.809 --> 00:17:19.191]  And putting somebody pro-life in there, you watch, Bush is going to make sure through the Senate that Arlen Specter gets that coveted seat and you're not going to see abortion outlawed in this country.
[00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:35.835]  By the way, the New York Times goes on to praise Arlen Specter and talk about how great he is and how good he is and how it's good that Republicans are standing up
[00:17:37.364 --> 00:17:38.785]  to the evil right wing.
[00:17:39.205 --> 00:17:55.274]  The outpouring illustrated how the party's conservative wing has been emboldened by the White House victory and the strengthening of Republican majorities in Congress, potentially raising new hazards for moderate Republicans who might want to break from the President or House or Senate leadership on major issues.
[00:17:55.895 --> 00:17:59.897]  Some Republicans on Capitol Hill said the attempt to quickly exert the influence
[00:18:00.515 --> 00:18:02.076]  Could work in Mr. Spector's favor.
[00:18:02.116 --> 00:18:12.322]  They said that after an energizing election, Senators would not necessarily want their first action to be jettisoning Mr. Spector under pressure from outside groups.
[00:18:12.422 --> 00:18:21.867]  Quote, we need to show some discipline and not overreact, one said, to the far right of the party.
[00:18:23.048 --> 00:18:28.811]  So see, now you're far right in the Republican Party if you're against abortion.
[00:18:29.747 --> 00:18:35.569]  You're far right if you're with 80 plus percent of Americans, Democrats included, and don't want wide open borders.
[00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:44.553]  You're far right if you're with 65 percent of the nation and the Second Amendment, if you're against any form of gun control.
[00:18:45.934 --> 00:18:47.374]  You're far right.
[00:18:47.394 --> 00:18:49.215]  I mean, it's a joke, people.
[00:18:49.635 --> 00:18:54.097]  So, just go back to sleep, and in four years you'll still have your abortion,
[00:18:55.370 --> 00:19:02.132]  Bush has expanded every great society welfare project ever invented, to use the words of Chuck Baldwin.
[00:19:04.793 --> 00:19:05.553]  I'm disgusted.
[00:19:07.433 --> 00:19:09.134]  And while Bush bad-mouths the U.N.
[00:19:09.154 --> 00:19:16.956]  out of one side of his mouth, the rhetoric, his actions are to actually increase it and sign over more of our sovereignty to it.
[00:19:17.910 --> 00:19:21.852]  Well, I don't care he's buttered and he's buttered and carries.
[00:19:22.413 --> 00:19:23.333]  Who's it loose but?
[00:19:23.674 --> 00:19:26.215]  Oh yeah, can you imagine if Kerry would have been elected?
[00:19:27.716 --> 00:19:34.040]  Then the conservatives wouldn't have gone to sleep and we could have done something about all of this.
[00:19:36.681 --> 00:19:40.804]  Or imagine if the Constitution Party would have gotten Michael Perutka in there.
[00:19:41.885 --> 00:19:42.545]  What would have happened?
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:51.370]  Alright, there's just so much more news, and what happens is I get kind of sped up here trying to cover it all, and I stumble over it, but there is so much here.
[00:19:51.410 --> 00:19:53.593]  We're going to cover it all today.
[00:19:54.454 --> 00:19:57.518]  Just the Big Brother section is about two inches thick.
[00:19:58.299 --> 00:19:59.220]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[00:20:01.505 --> 00:20:05.190]  You've heard about PAWS from Bio-Ox International and its bubble-up technology.
[00:20:05.490 --> 00:20:09.776]  But have you heard about Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate that also uses bubble-up technology?
[00:20:10.016 --> 00:20:16.945]  Bio-Ox Citrus Concentrate harnesses the power of oxygen to safely attack and remove dirt, stains, odors, and soils at the source.
[00:20:17.325 --> 00:20:23.995]  It's a sad fact, but in just seconds your carpet can be soiled with mud, your sofa ruined by pizza sauce, or your walls by color crayons.
[00:20:24.296 --> 00:20:27.761]  But in minutes, you can remove those problems with Bio-Ox to just concentrate.

[00:21:31.273 --> 00:21:33.134]  That's because it has an elevated base.

[00:22:01.295 --> 00:22:04.856]  Every hour of every day, someone out there is suffering from hemorrhoids.
[00:22:05.156 --> 00:22:07.677]  The pain, worry, and embarrassment can be devastating.

[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:26.581]  I ordered HEMTAB online, and soon after taking HEMTAB, the pain was gone.
[00:22:26.821 --> 00:22:28.722]  A few days later, the hemorrhoid began to shrink.
[00:22:29.042 --> 00:22:29.482]  Miracle?

[00:23:04.814 --> 00:23:08.236]  Last summer, we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[00:23:08.737 --> 00:23:09.417]  Let's update.
[00:23:09.918 --> 00:23:13.380]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.763]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[00:23:18.443 --> 00:23:19.384]  Two years ago, the U.S.
[00:23:19.424 --> 00:23:21.765]  dollar was worth 17% more than a euro.
[00:23:22.266 --> 00:23:23.166]  Today, the U.S.
[00:23:23.186 --> 00:23:25.428]  dollar is worth 28% less than a euro.
[00:23:25.808 --> 00:23:27.309]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[00:23:27.899 --> 00:23:29.880]  January of 02, gold spot was $283.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:36.102]  January of 04, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[00:23:37.102 --> 00:23:39.263]  Gold is moving, equities are treading water.
[00:23:39.663 --> 00:23:42.204]  This is a little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[00:23:42.842 --> 00:23:44.223]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[00:23:44.663 --> 00:23:46.384]  Physical possession, private gold.
[00:23:46.784 --> 00:23:48.765]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[00:23:49.165 --> 00:23:51.266]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[00:23:53.448 --> 00:23:55.609]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[00:23:55.969 --> 00:23:56.869]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:24:05.954 --> 00:24:07.895]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:24:08.355 --> 00:24:11.097]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:24:13.354 --> 00:24:18.875]  How could the government get us to accept the devaluation of the dollar of 40%?
[00:24:21.256 --> 00:24:27.637]  How could the government get us to accept having almost all of our high-tech and factory jobs shipped overseas?
[00:24:28.717 --> 00:24:36.039]  How could the government get us to accept national ID cards and cameras in school bathrooms and in the corporations?
[00:24:37.419 --> 00:24:43.000]  Well, they get us to rally around the flag, the plastic American flag made by slaves in China.
[00:24:44.582 --> 00:24:55.188]  During a outside threat, during a holy war, then any angst or anger we have about deteriorating conditions will be the fault of the enemies.
[00:24:56.548 --> 00:25:03.192]  Then you look at who creates these enemies, and it's the same globalists sucking our country dry.
[00:25:06.614 --> 00:25:12.437]  Meanwhile, my friends, Japan a couple years ago said they were going to start developing nuclear weapons.
[00:25:13.419 --> 00:25:16.041]  They have more nuclear reactors than anybody else on the planet.
[00:25:16.722 --> 00:25:20.605]  Japan's defense agency set three scenarios of China attack.
[00:25:22.026 --> 00:25:27.530]  Japanese agency officials established in internal meetings three scenarios of possible attacks.
[00:25:28.445 --> 00:25:34.849]  On Japan by China as the agency prepares to revamp national defense strategy, agency sources said Sunday.
[00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:46.637]  The scenarios are attacks stemming from disputes over ocean resources and territorial claims over the Hsinchu Islands as well as the clash across the Taiwan Strait, they said.
[00:25:47.378 --> 00:25:52.462]  All the scenarios are assumptions for discussions on Japan's future defense capability.
[00:25:52.843 --> 00:26:07.555]  They indicate a strong warning that China is a threat and are likely to further upset Beijing amid the ongoing political standoff over the development of the gas fields in the East China Sea as a territorial dispute over the islands.
[00:26:08.624 --> 00:26:15.067]  The scenarios are stipulated in the final report compiled in September by the Agency's Committee on Defense Capability.
[00:26:15.347 --> 00:26:23.592]  The Agency has not made the report public as it will be used for further discussions on the revision of the National Defense Program Outline, they said.
[00:26:27.834 --> 00:26:34.277]  And Japan is out of Constitution since our government set up a puppet government there when MacArthur was in country for a decade.
[00:26:36.119 --> 00:26:45.163]  And they are not allowed to have offensive forces, though now they have built one of the largest militaries in Asia, second only to China, in the last decade.
[00:26:45.203 --> 00:26:59.489]  And now their factories are bristling with submarines, destroyers, cruisers, jet fighter aircraft, tanks, and a lot of secret programs that have now been hinted at.
[00:26:59.529 --> 00:27:05.132]  And do you think the Japanese can make lots of little digital cameras and lots of cheap, well-operating cars
[00:27:06.225 --> 00:27:17.532]  Just wait till we find out about their full magnitude of their rearmament program that's going on right now feverishly.
[00:27:18.132 --> 00:27:22.415]  And again, feverishly is the operative word here.
[00:27:23.936 --> 00:27:25.797]  So the whole world arming to the teeth.
[00:27:25.957 --> 00:27:31.220]  A massive global escalation in weaponry.
[00:27:34.082 --> 00:27:41.288]  What's happening with our economy, though, is, well, really a big thing that we should all be concerned about.
[00:27:41.468 --> 00:27:44.370]  I earlier mentioned what's happening with the dollar.
[00:27:45.931 --> 00:27:55.919]  And it's funny, I've talked to most adults, and they don't even know what it means to have a weakening dollar.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:02.544]  The dollar plunged to even greater record lows,
[00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:06.392]  over the weekend and today.
[00:28:07.933 --> 00:28:20.481]  And our good ally, our good buddies that our government's giving all of our jobs and our technologies to, that the Fortune 500's in a love fest with, you watch CFR discussions on C-SPAN and they'll talk about China is the future.
[00:28:20.561 --> 00:28:22.282]  We're being dismantled right now.
[00:28:22.302 --> 00:28:29.026]  They're using the husk of what we were as the military force to complete the New World Order and take over any quote, rogue nations.
[00:28:29.766 --> 00:28:32.368]  But China's the model, a billion and a quarter good little slaves.
[00:28:34.113 --> 00:28:35.834]  And other dumping dollars in mass.
[00:28:35.874 --> 00:28:37.314]  Japan's starting to dump dollars.
[00:28:37.434 --> 00:28:38.515]  Europe's dumping dollars.
[00:28:39.235 --> 00:28:40.456]  Cuba's dumped their dollars.
[00:28:41.056 --> 00:28:42.677]  Latin America's starting to dump dollars.
[00:28:43.737 --> 00:28:45.338]  And the dollar is plunging.
[00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:57.223]  And Gerhard Schroeder came out on Saturday, El Chancellor of Deutschland, and said, hey, we're going to do nothing.
[00:28:57.263 --> 00:28:59.764]  We think this dropping dollar is a good thing.
[00:29:01.085 --> 00:29:01.845]  Now understand,
[00:29:03.058 --> 00:29:05.640]  They're going to later bring down the Euro as well.
[00:29:07.581 --> 00:29:18.548]  But the reason they're doing this with the dollar right now, and their own policy reports that we've gotten from the World Bank say this, is to go, see, we can't compete against the Euro, we've got to have the Amaro.
[00:29:19.489 --> 00:29:31.017]  And don't worry, every country will still have its own note, but they'll have the same digital information in them, and they'll be dollarized, and it'll be called the Amaro, and they're going to merge both the Euro and the Amaro,
[00:29:31.952 --> 00:29:40.117]  Uh, and the Asian, uh, denomination into the Phoenix, which they're admitted, already designed global currency.
[00:29:43.339 --> 00:29:47.221]  But, don't hold your breath for Peter Jennings and Dan Rather and Rush Limbaugh.
[00:29:47.941 --> 00:29:48.882]  I'll tell you about that one.
[00:29:49.242 --> 00:29:51.443]  We'll come back, talk about more of this, and start taking your calls.
[00:29:51.563 --> 00:29:52.524]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.984 --> 00:29:54.585]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:55.505 --> 00:29:58.167]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.321 --> 00:30:04.864]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.

[00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:14.391]  It truly works.
[00:30:14.781 --> 00:30:15.982]  Collagenate is wonderful.

[00:33:04.067 --> 00:33:10.109]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:33:10.709 --> 00:33:13.730]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:33:19.933 --> 00:33:24.515]  Yes, my friends, it is Monday, the 8th day of November 2004.
[00:33:25.315 --> 00:33:28.316]  Dylan, Manda, Fred, others, your calls are coming up.
[00:33:28.951 --> 00:33:31.693]  I want to go over Chuck Baldwin's great editorial he wrote.
[00:33:31.794 --> 00:33:36.197]  Christians and conservatives can go back to sleep now because the boogeyman is gone.
[00:33:37.679 --> 00:33:44.144]  Plus, there's another editorial here written by another patriot about the election.
[00:33:45.045 --> 00:33:49.469]  Really, I'd say the final word on it, so we'll be going over both of these.
[00:33:49.489 --> 00:33:55.354]  I will also detail gold hit 16-year high on the weak dollar.
[00:33:57.992 --> 00:34:04.816]  Dollar expected to fall amid China's rumored selling, and much, much more.
[00:34:04.836 --> 00:34:09.478]  I mean, this show is just going to be jam-packed because I've never had this much important news.
[00:34:09.859 --> 00:34:11.259]  It's total overload.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.020]  I'm chomping at the bit here.
[00:34:14.221 --> 00:34:24.547]  But before we go to these calls and start reading these articles, I was just very impressed with some of the work that some local Austinites are doing
[00:34:26.366 --> 00:34:31.951]  And so I invited James Ebert on the broadcast for a few minutes.
[00:34:32.091 --> 00:34:34.873]  They've been going into court and fighting the corrupt court systems.
[00:34:35.434 --> 00:34:38.677]  They've been locally training people how to fight the system.
[00:34:38.857 --> 00:34:44.902]  And they've got an author and researcher in town today who's going to be doing a seminar tonight.
[00:34:44.942 --> 00:34:46.303]  And no, this is not an infomercial.
[00:34:46.603 --> 00:34:48.145]  They're not sponsors of this show.
[00:34:48.625 --> 00:34:50.486]  I just think it's something you should know about.
[00:34:51.828 --> 00:34:53.129]  Freedom-School.com
[00:34:55.775 --> 00:34:58.436]  Because they're really having an effect.
[00:34:58.576 --> 00:35:03.298]  And things similar to this should be set up in every city.
[00:35:03.778 --> 00:35:07.139]  In fact, similar things are being set up in every city.
[00:35:07.779 --> 00:35:11.660]  So for this mini-interview, James Ebert, thank you for joining us.
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:12.941]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[00:35:12.961 --> 00:35:14.501]  I appreciate the opportunity.
[00:35:14.821 --> 00:35:15.381]  Oh, you bet.
[00:35:15.581 --> 00:35:17.322]  Freedom-school.com.
[00:35:17.522 --> 00:35:21.503]  And it's too late to register for this thing, this three-hour seminar, tonight on the website.
[00:35:21.883 --> 00:35:23.264]  But folks can do that.
[00:35:24.626 --> 00:35:34.035]  Well, I guess if they do it right now, I guess they could, but you've got to leave in about an hour, so if they don't register there, they can do it tonight, I guess, at the place where you're having this.
[00:35:34.415 --> 00:35:35.156]  Oh, that's correct.
[00:35:36.658 --> 00:35:37.738]  Yeah, we'd love to have you.
[00:35:37.778 --> 00:35:51.202]  We've got a few places open yet, and it's going to begin right at 6 o'clock tonight at a place called Joy East, which is on Riverside Drive, 2410 Riverside Drive, for those in the area here.
[00:35:51.662 --> 00:35:53.883]  Now that's a Chinese food restaurant.
[00:35:54.183 --> 00:35:54.703]  Yes, sir.
[00:35:54.723 --> 00:35:59.945]  And they've got a large selection buffet, which goes together with the seminar.
[00:36:00.945 --> 00:36:03.446]  So we plan to feed your mind and your body.
[00:36:04.474 --> 00:36:10.759]  Well, I intend, I keep procrastinating to get Mr. Stevens on the show.
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:16.844]  His book, Adventures in Legal Land, is excellent, and he's going to be there tonight.
[00:36:16.964 --> 00:36:21.888]  And, you know, we've had George Gordon on the show, does a great job, and is one of the Supreme Court different cases.
[00:36:21.908 --> 00:36:26.732]  We've got a lot of other legal scholars on the broadcast, people that come at this from different angles.
[00:36:27.193 --> 00:36:33.338]  Mark Stevens comes from it from a little bit different perspective, kind of in a nutshell, encapsulate that for us.
[00:36:34.088 --> 00:36:38.369]  Well, Mark's a veteran of about 10 years in what he calls legal land.
[00:36:38.469 --> 00:36:44.691]  And legal land is that strange place where sometimes black is white and white is black and other strange things.
[00:36:44.791 --> 00:36:51.893]  And he's come to know the right questions to ask, to put them into a box that they can't quite get out of.
[00:36:52.814 --> 00:37:02.458]  And remember, if they can't prove their case, they might go ahead and make it anyway, but if they can't really prove their case, they're going to be showing themselves up as being incompetent.
[00:37:02.998 --> 00:37:09.060]  And with these questions and the proper attitude, you can go in and pretty much take care of yourself.
[00:37:10.841 --> 00:37:15.723]  It's a great opportunity for people to learn things that they probably wouldn't have learned otherwise.
[00:37:16.463 --> 00:37:18.163]  And I was talking to you last night.
[00:37:18.183 --> 00:37:19.644]  If we don't
[00:37:20.549 --> 00:37:22.091]  Deal with this court system.
[00:37:22.151 --> 00:37:23.853]  The New World Order is going to win.
[00:37:25.354 --> 00:37:29.519]  Well, it's the sinister New World Order that you keep referring to.
[00:37:29.579 --> 00:37:32.502]  And these folks, they're out to win at any cost.
[00:37:32.602 --> 00:37:35.705]  And that means you and I are the cost.
[00:37:35.805 --> 00:37:42.232]  And if we don't stand up and promote ourselves... You remember, Alex, this country was founded on individualism.
[00:37:42.941 --> 00:37:55.595]  Well, it was also founded because the government came to confiscate guns, the government had corrupt court systems, the government was abusing people and had puppet courts that were not dispensing justice.
[00:37:55.635 --> 00:37:58.178]  In fact, that was some of the original complaints
[00:37:59.358 --> 00:38:07.703]  in the committees of correspondence was that the courts were a complete fraud and they've now basically gotten back to that point or if it's possible even worse.
[00:38:08.883 --> 00:38:11.204]  I would go for so far as to say even worse.
[00:38:12.225 --> 00:38:20.129]  I would ask the listeners there to pick up a copy of the Declaration of Independence and read the entire document, not just the first word.
[00:38:20.869 --> 00:38:24.591]  And tell me what the difference between what it was 230 some odd years ago as it is today.
[00:38:28.002 --> 00:38:31.344]  And, uh, Mark, uh, Mark is just a very articulate young man.
[00:38:31.364 --> 00:38:32.704]  He's been doing this for a while.
[00:38:33.265 --> 00:38:39.167]  And, uh, we here in Austin, as you say, have been, uh, doing what we can to fight this sinister New World Order.
[00:38:39.207 --> 00:38:46.771]  And this is just one more effort that we've put forth, uh, bringing Mark into town and, uh, giving the people here locally an opportunity to learn from him.
[00:38:47.091 --> 00:38:53.433]  Well, I would add that the reason I want to promote this, not just because it's good information and a good perspective, and again, there's no cure-all, folks.
[00:38:53.753 --> 00:38:54.754]  The courts are criminal.
[00:38:55.134 --> 00:39:02.777]  They don't even follow their own laws, but this is a somewhat more successful system than some of the others I've seen out there.
[00:39:02.817 --> 00:39:03.457]  Nothing's perfect.
[00:39:03.977 --> 00:39:11.202]  But it is useful that Mark on his own time is here in town to also help some people with their own court cases the next few days.
[00:39:11.743 --> 00:39:15.125]  And I appreciate him doing that, helping some people out that I'm friends with.
[00:39:15.445 --> 00:39:17.967]  And so that's why I'm here also supporting what he's doing.
[00:39:18.407 --> 00:39:19.728]  How long are you going to be at the office?
[00:39:19.768 --> 00:39:29.315]  How long can people still go to the website freedom-school.com and register for it through PayPal before they have to come and register there at the door?
[00:39:29.815 --> 00:39:31.496]  Oh, probably about 30, 40 minutes more.
[00:39:33.346 --> 00:39:40.289]  And yours truly is the chauffeur, and the pickup man, and the go-far, and the builder, and the whole nine yards.
[00:39:40.369 --> 00:39:44.571]  So you're the CEO, chief cook, bottle washer, window cleaner, yeah?
[00:39:44.911 --> 00:39:46.171]  Yeah, you know how that goes.
[00:39:46.552 --> 00:39:47.372]  I know how it is.
[00:39:47.772 --> 00:39:54.555]  Again, Freedom-School.com, or the Joy West, because there's a couple different... No, no, no, Alec, Joy East.
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:55.780]  Joy East!
[00:39:56.761 --> 00:39:59.423]  There is no Joy West that I'm aware of, but Joy East.
[00:39:59.603 --> 00:40:02.324]  Well, I'm dyslexic, so... Okay.
[00:40:02.345 --> 00:40:03.265]  That's my excuse.
[00:40:03.845 --> 00:40:04.866]  Hey, thanks for coming on.
[00:40:05.106 --> 00:40:15.253]  The address is 2410 East Riverside, and we will have a few seats for this private event tonight, and it starts right at 6 o'clock sharp.
[00:40:15.313 --> 00:40:20.716]  We want to hit the ground running and give the people a good full three hours of learning experience tonight.
[00:40:21.377 --> 00:40:22.718]  All right, I appreciate you coming on.
[00:40:22.998 --> 00:40:25.540]  Thank you, Alex, and keep up the great work you're doing.
[00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:26.701]  I will, my friend.
[00:40:27.421 --> 00:40:29.963]  James has done so much for families here in town.
[00:40:30.483 --> 00:40:38.449]  He has successfully, in many cases, when their lawyers aren't helping them, and they're in a lot of trouble over the most petty of issues.
[00:40:38.889 --> 00:40:44.053]  I've seen James go out and sit in court all day, even though he has a very successful web design business.
[00:40:44.073 --> 00:40:46.495]  I think he runs and designs over a hundred websites.
[00:40:47.195 --> 00:40:49.637]  You know, normal, smart, middle-class guy.
[00:40:50.350 --> 00:40:50.470]  Yeah.
[00:41:17.128 --> 00:41:26.013]  A lot of people get confused with terms and all, and you just mentioned the middle class, and the middle class is arguably the freest element in our society.
[00:41:26.613 --> 00:41:43.643]  A society without a middle class is... Look back in history, and I dare anyone to try to find a free society in a society without a middle class, and the current neocon administration has nothing to do with promoting conservative, what I call conservative values,
[00:41:45.986 --> 00:41:57.099]  In the last decade, whether they say we're in a recession or a boom, the middle class has shrunk according to all the economic indices, indicators, by 40%.
[00:41:57.139 --> 00:41:59.863]  It is disappearing.
[00:41:59.883 --> 00:42:00.804]  And what is the middle class?
[00:42:02.252 --> 00:42:25.868]  In Mexico, or North Korea, or in China, or in ancient Rome, or in feudal England, you have a tiny one-half of one percent, the nobility, ruling over ninety-plus percent that is the slave class, subsistence, and about nine-and-a-half percent that are a mid-level servant class to the elite, but still are totally dependent on that elite.
[00:42:26.008 --> 00:42:31.652]  In a middle class, a product of the Renaissance, and leaving the mercantile command-and-control system,
[00:42:32.732 --> 00:42:37.394]  We had a middle class, and now that middle class is disappearing.
[00:42:37.914 --> 00:42:40.535]  Corporate, private, government debts are at all-time levels.
[00:42:40.915 --> 00:42:50.198]  Our currency is rapidly approaching that of the ruble or the peso, and the average American doesn't even know what that means!
[00:42:52.219 --> 00:42:56.821]  Well, I'd like to talk about something that's rather acute and local.
[00:42:57.281 --> 00:43:00.582]  Here in Austin, Texas, there is now a mold
[00:43:01.198 --> 00:43:04.620]  that you can smell in the municipal water supply.
[00:43:06.481 --> 00:43:08.682]  My wife started talking about it a few days ago.
[00:43:08.702 --> 00:43:16.146]  We drink out of Berkey filters and we use the Aeronizer.
[00:43:16.166 --> 00:43:26.111]  A few days ago my wife started talking about the water smelled or tasted different and then my mother and sister confirmed that too.
[00:43:27.024 --> 00:43:46.192]  The water from their residence, from my mother's job in another location they're out about, and the water, I was noticing also in my office, a smell coming up from a drain for about a couple of weeks now, but we've had some weird plumbing in the past, but it was a new smell.
[00:43:46.492 --> 00:43:53.435]  But then when my wife and my mother and sister started saying, oh yeah, water tastes quite different, smells different, and check this out Alex,
[00:43:54.401 --> 00:44:09.709]  A while back we lived in an apartment that had some water problems and there was like interior mold and the tiniest bit of water leak in the bathroom would leave our bathroom smelling like cigarette, stale cigarette smoke.
[00:44:10.169 --> 00:44:11.390]  That's how this mold smells.
[00:44:11.450 --> 00:44:13.371]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[00:44:15.212 --> 00:44:19.234]  It's funny that you called and mentioned this because obviously we purify our water too.
[00:44:20.516 --> 00:44:26.081]  And I've noticed that water coming out of the tap that we use to wash dishes and stuff has been stinking.
[00:44:27.041 --> 00:44:28.322]  And we don't live in an apartment.
[00:44:28.603 --> 00:44:31.345]  And have other people in Austin noticed this?
[00:44:31.945 --> 00:44:35.188]  Amanda in Colorado, thanks for holding.
[00:44:35.208 --> 00:44:35.588]  Go ahead.
[00:44:36.929 --> 00:44:38.751]  Hey Alex, this is my first time to call.
[00:44:39.792 --> 00:44:41.733]  I just wanted to commend you.
[00:44:41.773 --> 00:44:43.775]  I was listening to you for the first time last week.
[00:44:43.815 --> 00:44:44.575]  I started listening.
[00:44:45.794 --> 00:44:50.138]  I've been in America for a couple of years and I started watching C-SPAN about a year ago.
[00:45:10.217 --> 00:45:14.325]  And it is the most informative and educational thing that there is on television.
[00:45:14.385 --> 00:45:20.757]  And I'm just astounded that more Americans don't realize that they have this program on television.
[00:45:21.338 --> 00:45:22.620]  Washington Journal in the mornings.
[00:45:23.334 --> 00:45:27.276]  And then you've got Book TV on Channel 59 here in Colorado.
[00:45:27.556 --> 00:45:32.678]  Well, what's interesting about it is that you'll see CFR meetings where they go.
[00:45:32.698 --> 00:45:33.278]  Exactly.
[00:45:33.318 --> 00:45:34.718]  We're going to have a global government.
[00:45:34.738 --> 00:45:36.259]  We're going to take all your rights.
[00:45:36.359 --> 00:45:37.719]  They'll have the Pentagon on.
[00:45:37.739 --> 00:45:39.080]  We're going to attack everyone.
[00:45:39.380 --> 00:45:40.821]  We're going to have a national draft.
[00:45:40.881 --> 00:45:41.981]  It's for a global government.
[00:45:42.181 --> 00:45:42.481]  It's all there.
[00:45:42.501 --> 00:45:44.542]  The Pentagon works for the private corporations.
[00:45:45.382 --> 00:45:47.043]  I mean, they just admit it all.
[00:45:47.223 --> 00:45:49.524]  And then people say, well, Alex, you've got conspiracy theories.
[00:45:49.904 --> 00:45:51.344]  No, this is a conspiracy!
[00:45:51.405 --> 00:45:52.465]  It's all public!
[00:45:52.645 --> 00:45:57.506]  And not just that, the Council on Foreign Relations puts out a foreign affairs journal.
[00:45:57.826 --> 00:46:04.228]  And it also lists inside there, they have articles that are written by, usually by academics and other experts.
[00:46:04.328 --> 00:46:07.789]  By the way, Henry Kissinger has written another article calling for global government.
[00:46:08.130 --> 00:46:09.690]  I'm not surprised.
[00:46:11.593 --> 00:46:13.434]  But global government doesn't exist.
[00:46:13.994 --> 00:46:19.677]  You see, the double thing is if you say it exists and it's good, we'll give you a master's degree and make you a tenured professor.
[00:46:19.957 --> 00:46:24.759]  But the minute you say it exists but it's bad, you're insane, probably schizophrenic.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:33.343]  But the problem also is that the American people have been so dumbed down that they don't know and they're not educated enough to know.
[00:46:33.563 --> 00:46:34.543]  It's the school system.
[00:46:34.763 --> 00:46:40.286]  You have people graduating who are barely literate, barely able to even put together a paragraph.
[00:46:41.082 --> 00:46:44.803]  And the government then increases education funding because that's the goal.
[00:46:44.843 --> 00:46:49.884]  We've had the former number two in the Reagan administration, Department of Education, on.
[00:46:49.924 --> 00:46:50.965]  She has the documents.
[00:46:51.425 --> 00:46:56.606]  It was done by design starting in the twenties to teach people how to not think.
[00:46:56.666 --> 00:47:03.328]  In fact, Kindergarten, the German model, is a Prussian model of how to make the children automatons.
[00:47:06.188 --> 00:47:08.509]  There are many, many books out there that
[00:47:09.147 --> 00:47:22.338]  that allude to that point, that it's a deliberate dumbing down of the system so people are no longer able to critically analyse and to question and they're not encouraged to question because if people are educated then they're going to know.
[00:47:22.358 --> 00:47:35.690]  If people know who their elected officials are, do their research on who these people are, their background, their education, their careers, their political careers, the people in the Bush administration, who these people are, people will then know, they'll be able to see through.
[00:47:36.932 --> 00:47:37.512]  What's going on?
[00:47:37.532 --> 00:47:48.295]  Well, I mean, you know, the same corporations, the same kingmakers, the same globalist thinkers run Bill Clinton's White House, George Bush's White House.
[00:47:48.395 --> 00:47:49.195]  It doesn't matter.
[00:47:49.435 --> 00:47:51.616]  It's exactly the same people pulling the strings.
[00:47:51.876 --> 00:47:59.117]  The people who are at the heads of the Council of Foreign Relations, people on the Trilateral Commission, the Budeberg Organization.
[00:47:59.678 --> 00:48:01.118]  And what happened in these meetings?
[00:48:01.618 --> 00:48:02.118]  Who knows?
[00:48:02.278 --> 00:48:03.459]  They had closed doors.
[00:48:03.799 --> 00:48:05.199]  Well, here's a startling example.
[00:48:06.491 --> 00:48:11.415]  The Pan-American Union, through the Free Trade Area of the Americas, becomes law next year.
[00:48:12.275 --> 00:48:18.040]  You've already heard, folks, that we've got to pay Social Security to 30 Caribbean and American countries.
[00:48:18.901 --> 00:48:19.921]  Well, that's only part of it.
[00:48:20.622 --> 00:48:24.365]  Our highways, our police, our schools, our laws, our currency.
[00:48:24.945 --> 00:48:26.646]  We're going to have a capital in Atlanta.
[00:48:27.687 --> 00:48:28.588]  That's now official.
[00:48:29.649 --> 00:48:32.511]  Some debate it may be moved to Miami, but it looks like Atlanta.
[00:48:33.972 --> 00:48:39.114]  You tell the average person how you heard of the EU, a lot of them will say, isn't that a conspiracy theory?
[00:48:39.415 --> 00:48:40.075]  They even say that.
[00:48:40.095 --> 00:48:43.076]  They don't even know what the EU is.
[00:48:43.116 --> 00:48:47.138]  Listen, me and my wife are driving back from seeing a movie Saturday night.
[00:48:47.778 --> 00:48:49.479]  We're listening to KLBJ59.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:55.622]  And they actually had on the show a guy talking about the Federal Reserve.
[00:48:56.992 --> 00:49:01.294]  Just reading what's publicly known at the Federal Reserve is private.
[00:49:01.395 --> 00:49:02.055]  It's admitted.
[00:49:02.075 --> 00:49:04.356]  Unconstitutional.
[00:49:04.656 --> 00:49:08.178]  And callers are calling in going, you're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:49:08.839 --> 00:49:12.120]  And then my wife called in and said, well, here's the problem.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:14.562]  They issue the money and then we got to pay interest on it.
[00:49:15.282 --> 00:49:18.304]  And these private banks get to buy everything up with money machines they own.
[00:49:18.985 --> 00:49:23.548]  And then even the so-called guest goes, well, it's not a conspiracy like you say it is.
[00:49:23.628 --> 00:49:24.328]  It's just public.
[00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:26.249]  Well, we didn't say it was a conspiracy.
[00:49:26.470 --> 00:49:29.972]  We called it criminal because that is criminal.
[00:49:32.013 --> 00:49:36.796]  So, again, you tell people there's a Pan-American Union.
[00:49:38.064 --> 00:49:41.825]  When, again, Bush in 2001, he goes to Canada.
[00:49:41.885 --> 00:49:42.686]  It's on C-SPAN.
[00:49:42.746 --> 00:49:43.346]  I taped it.
[00:49:43.726 --> 00:49:46.567]  They're openly signing deals to create the Pan-American Union.
[00:49:46.907 --> 00:49:47.587]  It's public.
[00:49:48.088 --> 00:50:05.234]  But because it wasn't on Tom Brokaw or Peter Jennings, and it's scary and people don't want to face it, they instantly rationalize and use that catch-all rationalization of that denial mechanism, that loyal opposition-triggered
[00:50:07.356 --> 00:50:08.758]  Oh, what's the term I want to use?
[00:50:08.838 --> 00:50:09.999]  Cognitive dissidence.
[00:50:10.359 --> 00:50:12.261]  Anything to ignore a threat.
[00:50:12.481 --> 00:50:14.784]  Well, I just say it isn't true, it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:50:15.204 --> 00:50:16.926]  And that's exactly what they do.
[00:50:17.366 --> 00:50:22.412]  They label it as a conspiracy theory because they don't want to admit that there's truth, that it's truth.
[00:50:22.732 --> 00:50:27.537]  It's like saying the moon in the sky at night is a conspiracy theory.
[00:50:28.169 --> 00:50:32.572]  It's like saying salt water in the Atlantic Ocean is a conspiracy theory.
[00:50:33.072 --> 00:50:40.057]  It's like saying women give birth to children, not men, and they say, no, men give birth to children.
[00:50:40.337 --> 00:50:41.618]  You're a conspiracy theorist.
[00:50:41.738 --> 00:50:47.722]  It's like saying the sky is blue at high noon and they say, no, it's purple.
[00:50:48.963 --> 00:50:51.065]  We're just pointing out the facts.
[00:50:51.745 --> 00:50:54.507]  They're making people take microchips to have federal jobs.
[00:50:55.430 --> 00:50:56.811]  They're taking our freedoms.
[00:50:56.831 --> 00:50:58.653]  They're putting cameras in school bathrooms.
[00:50:58.993 --> 00:50:59.634]  It's real.
[00:50:59.674 --> 00:51:00.214]  We'll be back.
[00:51:01.375 --> 00:51:02.896]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:51:03.076 --> 00:51:06.179]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[00:51:06.299 --> 00:51:10.202]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[00:51:10.242 --> 00:51:14.486]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[00:51:14.826 --> 00:51:18.609]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[00:51:18.689 --> 00:51:20.551]  The civil emergency was created by the police.
[00:51:21.131 --> 00:51:24.033]  Why have police attacked people on the street indiscriminately?
[00:51:24.073 --> 00:51:28.776]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[00:51:28.956 --> 00:51:31.997]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[00:51:32.177 --> 00:51:35.039]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[00:51:35.519 --> 00:51:41.643]  The neighbors in that area of Sandpoint Naval Air Station were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[00:51:42.183 --> 00:51:45.964]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.

[00:52:23.448 --> 00:52:32.810]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[00:52:33.070 --> 00:52:36.571]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.

[00:54:08.519 --> 00:54:20.184]  When you watch The Globalist on C-SPAN, or you read one of their declassified documents, or their public statements, or you hear them on NPR, they'll say, Americans have had it too good, too long.
[00:54:20.244 --> 00:54:21.444]  Our standard of living is too high.
[00:54:21.965 --> 00:54:25.306]  We've got to be globalized and have our standard brought down.
[00:54:26.767 --> 00:54:30.628]  See, when they say normalize wealth, they don't mean the whole world become wealthy.
[00:54:31.329 --> 00:54:34.650]  They mean a tiny elite going back to feudalism or serfdom.
[00:54:36.132 --> 00:54:43.915]  And I remember two years ago, a year and a half ago, being in Kansas City, I was there to give a speech.
[00:54:45.335 --> 00:54:56.759]  And I was sitting there in my hotel room watching Bush and his Treasury Secretary, his new one Snow, say that actually a weak dollar is a good thing and this will help our exports.
[00:54:58.542 --> 00:54:59.703]  Well, it's in a negligible way.
[00:54:59.763 --> 00:55:00.103]  It's true.
[00:55:00.143 --> 00:55:05.146]  People will buy more American goods if their foreign currencies can come in here and buy up more.
[00:55:05.226 --> 00:55:11.449]  You know, it's like you go to a trip to Mexico because your dollar's, you know, worth ten times that in pesos.
[00:55:13.370 --> 00:55:15.151]  But still, it means you're a third world country.
[00:55:15.851 --> 00:55:22.775]  And if already the basis of your industrial base has been shipped overseas, it has a negligible effect.
[00:55:24.341 --> 00:55:41.572]  Not to mention the fact that we can't compete against, you know, 20 cents an hour by slaves in China, slave wages, no workers' compensation, no regulation, no environmental standards, and a 40-plus percent tariff on us on average, and that's just one of 130-plus third-world countries we're competing against.
[00:55:42.332 --> 00:55:44.974]  They have tariffs on us, we don't have tariffs on them.
[00:55:45.594 --> 00:55:46.775]  How's that free market?
[00:55:46.895 --> 00:55:49.817]  It's designed to get the jobs out of the country.
[00:55:53.203 --> 00:55:55.804]  Meanwhile, the Euro is 30% gold-backed.
[00:55:56.664 --> 00:55:59.024]  Gold hit 16-year high on week dollar.
[00:55:59.104 --> 00:56:04.245]  Gold prices shot up to 16-year highs on Friday as the dollar fell to record lows against the Euro.
[00:56:04.626 --> 00:56:10.407]  And President Bush's re-election made traders blush and bullish towards the precious metal.
[00:56:11.627 --> 00:56:18.288]  Oil prices started the day lower, then rallied to, in the week, higher as signals on technical prices charts and strong U.S.
[00:56:18.329 --> 00:56:20.409]  employment data from Washington sparked buying.
[00:56:21.269 --> 00:56:22.209]  Strong employment data.
[00:56:22.229 --> 00:56:23.710]  You've been hearing that for ten years.
[00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:28.451]  Dollar expected to fall amid China's rumored selling.
[00:56:28.471 --> 00:56:35.993]  The dollar could slide further in spite of hitting an all-time low against the Euro last week in the wake of George W. Bush's re-election, currency traders have said.
[00:56:36.013 --> 00:56:42.934]  The dollar sell-off is presumed amid fears among traders that Mr. Bush's victory will bring four more years of widening U.S.
[00:56:42.994 --> 00:56:50.736]  budget and current account deficits, highlighting geopolitical risk and a policy of benign neglect of the dollar.
[00:56:53.564 --> 00:57:00.469]  And, uh, folks, all this means is our European owners, and that's who predominantly owns the U.S.
[00:57:00.489 --> 00:57:02.871]  It's not the Japanese or the Chinese like you heard during the 80s.
[00:57:03.331 --> 00:57:05.392]  It's the British, the Dutch, and the Germans, and the French.
[00:57:05.873 --> 00:57:06.813]  They own America!
[00:57:07.194 --> 00:57:07.914]  A few families.
[00:57:08.454 --> 00:57:09.435]  That's even in Forbes.
[00:57:10.636 --> 00:57:12.797]  They come in here, they buy the whole thing up.
[00:57:15.139 --> 00:57:17.301]  And now China's saying they're gonna dump the dollar.
[00:57:19.002 --> 00:57:21.964]  It probably won't go down but another ten cents.
[00:57:22.992 --> 00:57:27.116]  But having it already devalued by 40% is devastating enough.
[00:57:27.976 --> 00:57:29.257]  I mean, you've got money in the bank.
[00:57:29.758 --> 00:57:31.159]  It's been devalued by 40%.
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:34.982]  And again, I talk to businessmen and they don't know what that means.
[00:57:35.062 --> 00:57:42.428]  It's like we're mind-controlled, but a Mexican corn farmer who makes $2,000 a year knows all about it!
[00:57:45.051 --> 00:57:46.432]  You're educated idiots!
[00:57:48.056 --> 00:57:49.797]  I'm talking to those out there that make jokes about it.
[00:57:49.817 --> 00:57:58.980]  I mean, like I called in to KLBJ and there were good old boys calling in going, well, if the Federal Reserve is private, I'm sure they know what they're doing and this is a good thing.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:57:59.901]  That's another thing.
[00:57:59.941 --> 00:58:08.844]  They'll deny all this exists and then when the Italian or Mexican government comes out and says we're going to make all our police take a chip or we're going to make all the U.S.
[00:58:08.884 --> 00:58:09.844]  military take chips.
[00:58:09.884 --> 00:58:11.885]  I told you about that years ago now they're starting to announce it.
[00:58:12.525 --> 00:58:14.106]  First it was it didn't exist.
[00:58:16.568 --> 00:58:17.048]  I'm a kook.
[00:58:17.088 --> 00:58:17.749]  I'm making it up.
[00:58:17.769 --> 00:58:18.849]  There's no plan to do this.
[00:58:21.371 --> 00:58:25.733]  And then now it's, okay, well maybe we do need chips.
[00:58:25.833 --> 00:58:26.393]  I've heard them.
[00:58:26.413 --> 00:58:29.155]  Because, hey, I'm a business owner.
[00:58:29.595 --> 00:58:30.976]  I'm a member of the establishment.
[00:58:31.896 --> 00:58:34.258]  There ain't no way I'm getting put in a bad position.
[00:58:34.758 --> 00:58:39.420]  If I see something coming down that looks like slavery, I'll just say I'm part of it and say it's good.
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:40.961]  Then I ain't got to worry about it.
[00:58:40.981 --> 00:58:44.203]  Because I got the psychology of a rat.
[00:58:45.737 --> 00:58:49.099]  Well, you just keep thinking like that, you kiss your children's future goodbye.
[00:58:57.625 --> 00:58:58.285]  Big Brother.
[00:58:58.925 --> 00:59:00.006]  Mainstream media.
[00:59:00.706 --> 00:59:01.827]  Government cover-ups.
[00:59:02.468 --> 00:59:03.328]  You want answers?
[00:59:04.029 --> 00:59:05.550]  Well, so does he.
[00:59:05.610 --> 00:59:09.512]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:59:09.772 --> 00:59:13.855]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:59:15.755 --> 00:59:21.798]  The Titanic is sinking, and they're telling you that knocking more holes in the side of it is a good idea.
[00:59:21.818 --> 00:59:25.320]  Running into more icebergs, it's wonderful.
[00:59:26.141 --> 00:59:27.141]  Dollar plunging.
[00:59:27.702 --> 00:59:29.002]  Foreign governments dumping it.
[00:59:30.543 --> 00:59:32.464]  The media tells you how great everything is.
[00:59:32.504 --> 00:59:34.405]  The battle for Fallujah is heating up.
[00:59:34.465 --> 00:59:35.466]  A lot of dead U.S.
[00:59:35.526 --> 00:59:36.887]  and Iraqi troops.
[00:59:37.879 --> 00:59:39.440]  I know when you hear the word Iraqi, you think bad.
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.121]  I mean the troops that work for our government.
[00:59:41.461 --> 00:59:42.041]  Yes, those.
[00:59:42.081 --> 00:59:44.082]  I know you've said kill all Iraqis.
[00:59:44.122 --> 00:59:47.724]  Well, some of them actually work for the globalists, so you should get out of that psychology.
[00:59:49.605 --> 00:59:53.307]  And we've also got just a bunch of big brother news today.
[00:59:53.487 --> 00:59:56.269]  So much on election fraud, what happened last week.
[00:59:56.989 --> 01:00:02.893]  Clearly, Ohio and New Mexico went for Kerry, and I do not support Kerry.
[01:00:02.973 --> 01:00:04.373]  I'm just reporting the facts.
[01:00:04.814 --> 01:00:07.255]  Kerry didn't dispute it because it was a staged event.
[01:00:08.519 --> 01:00:09.960]  Okay, I want to talk about this PTO.
[01:00:37.875 --> 01:00:42.919]  P-2-O-G, the Proactive Pre-Emptive Operations Group?
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:44.640]  Yes!
[01:00:44.681 --> 01:00:50.465]  You're right on the money when you talk about the classified document.
[01:00:50.485 --> 01:00:54.288]  You have to guide the Pentagon for that, for the creation of that.
[01:00:55.028 --> 01:01:00.693]  And it prods these terrorist cells into action.
[01:01:01.814 --> 01:01:06.237]  They set up these terrorist cells and then they sit back and then prod them into action.
[01:01:07.219 --> 01:01:10.782]  By using this preemptive operations group.
[01:01:11.362 --> 01:01:14.084]  And so much of what the globalists do is hidden in plain view.
[01:01:14.625 --> 01:01:21.310]  Oh yeah, we were running drills of flying hijacked jets into buildings at the exact same targets at the exact same time in the morning.
[01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:23.271]  The Pentagon admits that.
[01:01:23.691 --> 01:01:25.012]  The CIA admits that.
[01:01:26.193 --> 01:01:32.358]  Oh yeah, we've got a six billion dollar a year program to get terrorists to attack us and to create new terror groups.
[01:01:32.718 --> 01:01:34.560]  And the other thing is that you have
[01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:46.041]  We have this continuing ties of the administration, the Bush family, with Saudi agents.
[01:01:46.221 --> 01:01:51.262]  In other words, the government there is synonymous with the elite.
[01:01:51.422 --> 01:01:53.483]  There is no elected government.
[01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:59.024]  Whether it's Manuel Noriega or Saddam Hussein or Osama Bin Laden, they always work.
[01:01:59.631 --> 01:02:01.372]  With the Bushes and the Globalists there.
[01:02:01.472 --> 01:02:04.893]  It's such a reliable rule of thumb.
[01:02:04.973 --> 01:02:11.916]  We better smarten up and preface our discussions with our friends with these facts.
[01:02:12.036 --> 01:02:17.578]  Because if we don't preface our discussions with these facts, we're going to misinterpret the news.
[01:02:18.139 --> 01:02:25.342]  And I thank you for bringing this up and keep pounding this Pentagon report.
[01:02:25.702 --> 01:02:27.322]  I don't know how the hell that slipped out.
[01:02:27.362 --> 01:02:28.543]  Do you know how that slipped out?
[01:02:28.971 --> 01:02:31.531]  Oh, no, they're public!
[01:02:32.132 --> 01:02:33.772]  No, see, they hide it in plain view.
[01:02:33.812 --> 01:02:34.892]  That's a trick they run.
[01:02:35.672 --> 01:02:39.053]  Well, I mean, right here is a reference to an article in the L.A.
[01:02:39.113 --> 01:02:44.114]  Times, October 27, 2002, titled The Secret War.
[01:02:45.074 --> 01:02:46.314]  And it's by William Arkin.
[01:02:46.334 --> 01:02:47.734]  I don't know anything about the article.
[01:02:47.854 --> 01:02:53.675]  Well, it's like the Pentagon Office of Strategic Influence.
[01:02:53.695 --> 01:02:57.756]  They come out and say, we're going to lie to you now and plant fake news stories in the foreign and U.S.
[01:02:57.776 --> 01:02:58.096]  press.
[01:02:59.241 --> 01:03:03.948]  And then their first official action was to say, oh disregard that, that was the first line.
[01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:08.475]  Yeah, and if there was let's say a tremendous uproar...
[01:03:09.102 --> 01:03:14.064]  In opposition to it, they would simply say, well, we're not going to do it, but they'd be lying to you.
[01:03:14.104 --> 01:03:16.085]  Well, it's like the Pentagon betting scheme.
[01:03:16.165 --> 01:03:18.826]  Betting on dead troops, betting on where we'll be attacked next.
[01:03:19.126 --> 01:03:29.931]  Where the globalists can, like the insider traded on 9-11, they can insider trade publicly and make money off their actions, and then they can carry out terror attacks and even bet on it publicly and make money.
[01:03:30.371 --> 01:03:33.893]  Everything they do that's criminal or illegal, they just make it public.
[01:03:35.757 --> 01:03:36.278]  Tom, go ahead.
[01:03:36.618 --> 01:03:39.582]  The futures market on terrorist strategy.
[01:03:39.622 --> 01:03:44.248]  Yeah, that's because people don't have a moral or psychological or historical compass.
[01:03:44.849 --> 01:03:50.536]  All people go off of is somebody acting like something's wrong, so they just act like it's all okay and people go, okay!
[01:03:53.132 --> 01:03:57.474]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:03:57.634 --> 01:04:02.076]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:04:02.216 --> 01:04:06.578]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[01:04:06.638 --> 01:04:07.999]  The New World Order.
[01:04:08.799 --> 01:04:09.660]  Hammered!
[01:04:09.781 --> 01:04:14.025]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:04:14.065 --> 01:04:21.013]  We rip the sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:04:21.133 --> 01:04:23.156]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:04:23.496 --> 01:04:33.999]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:04:34.119 --> 01:04:39.500]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:04:40.020 --> 01:04:42.681]  Visit Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order.
[01:04:42.761 --> 01:04:43.921]  Or call toll-free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:04:43.941 --> 01:04:44.361]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:04:44.461 --> 01:04:46.202]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:04:53.931 --> 01:04:58.434]  Through the years of providing water filters to America, you've come to us and we've listened.
[01:04:58.774 --> 01:05:02.856]  You asked us to make the water level visible to eliminate the guesswork when refilling the water.
[01:05:03.156 --> 01:05:03.697]  We listened.
[01:05:04.017 --> 01:05:09.000]  You asked for an elevated base so the system could be used in places beside on the edge of a counter.
[01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:09.760]  We listened.
[01:05:10.141 --> 01:05:13.182]  You asked us to develop a filter that was made in the USA.
[01:05:13.603 --> 01:05:14.123]  We listened.
[01:05:14.583 --> 01:05:18.665]  You asked us to include an emergency light for camping and during power outages.
[01:05:19.046 --> 01:05:19.526]  We listened.
[01:05:19.866 --> 01:05:25.109]  After 9-11, you asked us to develop a filter that was more powerful in removing chemical agents.
[01:05:25.529 --> 01:05:26.890]  Again, we listened.
[01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:34.635]  Introducing the Berkey Light, the gravity filter requested by America, designed by Americans, and made in America.
[01:05:35.015 --> 01:05:38.477]  Get the Berkey Light, the American water filter, for only $259 by calling
[01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:43.856]  That's toll-free, 803-4438.
[01:05:43.876 --> 01:05:45.138]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[01:05:53.231 --> 01:05:54.692]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:05:54.912 --> 01:06:02.238]  Jerry Guinetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:06.981]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:06:07.241 --> 01:06:17.069]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:06:17.830 --> 01:06:21.495]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:06:21.836 --> 01:06:24.320]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:30.549]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:06:30.810 --> 01:06:32.372]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:06:32.612 --> 01:06:33.493]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:06:33.593 --> 01:06:36.576]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:06:36.736 --> 01:06:37.636]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:06:37.677 --> 01:06:37.857]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:06:37.917 --> 01:06:40.999]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:06:41.019 --> 01:06:41.980]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:06:54.255 --> 01:07:00.278]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:00.898 --> 01:07:03.940]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:11.503]  It is, my friends, November 8th, 2004, on this live Monday edition.
[01:07:11.543 --> 01:07:14.965]  I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[01:07:16.325 --> 01:07:16.866]  What is that?
[01:07:18.270 --> 01:07:19.391]  10 to 1, Mountain.
[01:07:19.811 --> 01:07:20.972]  Noon to 3, Eastern.
[01:07:21.373 --> 01:07:25.435]  And then, of course, back from 9 to Midnight, Central, going out on the AM and FM dial.
[01:07:26.116 --> 01:07:30.139]  And simulcasting on Global Shortwave during the day at 9.985.
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.701]  And at night at 3210.
[01:07:33.181 --> 01:07:41.847]  And, of course, at PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.net and InfoWars.com.
[01:07:44.232 --> 01:07:45.954]  And people ask, why do I have four websites?
[01:07:45.974 --> 01:07:49.276]  Well, because I have three different webmasters with some different news on each site.
[01:07:49.617 --> 01:07:54.201]  A lot of the same news every day, but different video clips, different audio clips, some different text reports.
[01:07:55.081 --> 01:07:58.184]  Also, it gives us four different servers and redundancy.
[01:07:59.165 --> 01:08:04.610]  That is mirrors of these archives of articles and documents and sections.
[01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:08.213]  And then that much more people actually go out and visit the sites.
[01:08:10.535 --> 01:08:13.837]  And all of us should have our own website, should have the capacity to do it.
[01:08:13.877 --> 01:08:15.498]  We should all be involved in the news.
[01:08:15.598 --> 01:08:17.540]  We should take over the internet.
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:20.602]  So I practice what I preach.
[01:08:21.883 --> 01:08:24.444]  Any of you that have websites should start a second website.
[01:08:25.445 --> 01:08:27.346]  We've got to take the entire web over.
[01:08:28.067 --> 01:08:37.533]  Before I go to Charles and David and Carol and many many others, I want to read quickly this article by Chuck Baldwin
[01:08:38.979 --> 01:08:42.902]  Who, of course, was the Constitution Party vice presidential nominee.
[01:08:43.582 --> 01:08:50.146]  He has been on this broadcast as a guest and also writes for PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:51.687]  We carry some of his articles.
[01:08:52.568 --> 01:08:54.869]  He's a great American and he just puts it so well.
[01:08:54.909 --> 01:08:56.210]  He's a real conservative.
[01:08:57.471 --> 01:09:04.195]  So for all the super commies that didn't know it, you're the future of the New World Order of Minions.
[01:09:04.455 --> 01:09:06.076]  You think you're conservative and you're not.
[01:09:06.517 --> 01:09:08.438]  Listen to what a real conservative has to say.
[01:09:09.915 --> 01:09:14.737]  Christians and conservatives can go back to sleep now because the boogeyman is gone.
[01:09:15.517 --> 01:09:27.661]  On November 2nd, millions of evangelical Christians and social conservatives awakened from their traditional four-year hibernation just in time to re-elect George W. Bush.
[01:09:29.322 --> 01:09:31.122]  What horrid event awakened them?
[01:09:31.242 --> 01:09:36.304]  It was the presence of a big bad boogeyman named John Forbes Carey.
[01:09:37.580 --> 01:09:45.324]  Who, I would add, is also Bush's cousin and a member of the open Skull and Bones Society, openly satanic, known as the Order of Death.
[01:09:45.804 --> 01:09:48.525]  Christ is life, and who's death?
[01:09:48.845 --> 01:09:54.368]  Well, that's... Maybe we're evil, as some national Christian talk show hosts have said.
[01:09:54.768 --> 01:09:57.689]  Maybe I'm of the devil because I criticized Bush.
[01:09:58.690 --> 01:10:00.971]  Maybe death is good and life is bad.
[01:10:01.031 --> 01:10:01.831]  Maybe I've been wrong.
[01:10:02.511 --> 01:10:04.913]  Boogeyman Kerry was a dreadful monster.
[01:10:04.973 --> 01:10:05.693]  He drank blood.
[01:10:06.474 --> 01:10:09.975]  He bit the hands of birds.
[01:10:10.835 --> 01:10:12.256]  He mutilated animals.
[01:10:12.376 --> 01:10:14.437]  He huffed and puffed and blew down houses.
[01:10:14.997 --> 01:10:17.118]  He pushed little old ladies down staircases.
[01:10:17.658 --> 01:10:20.939]  He played polo with human skulls.
[01:10:21.139 --> 01:10:23.620]  As a child, his favorite game was kick the cat.
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:30.502]  He was a heinous creature, however, Christians and Conservatives can now go back to sleep because the dreaded Boogeyman
[01:10:31.246 --> 01:10:35.987]  Who didn't really fight Bush on any issue, and didn't contest the election because it was staged, is gone.
[01:10:36.387 --> 01:10:37.447]  I'm adding a few things here.
[01:10:38.007 --> 01:10:41.708]  After all, snoozing is what Christians and conservatives do best.
[01:10:42.268 --> 01:10:54.251]  Their naps come in four-year increments, disturbed only every presidential election cycle by the pounding footsteps of the latest Democratic boogeyman, who just so happens to vote identically to Bush.
[01:10:56.291 --> 01:10:59.632]  And now that the boogeyman is gone, they can all go back to Betty-by.
[01:11:00.859 --> 01:11:13.447]  In the event, however, that a few Christians or conservatives are still only putting on their pajamas and have not yet quite made it back to the sack, let me tell you what you missed the last four years while you were unconscious.
[01:11:14.408 --> 01:11:24.935]  Number one, your knight in shining armor, George W. Bush, superintended over the deaths of more than four million innocent unborn babies and did nothing to stop their slaughter.
[01:11:25.636 --> 01:11:29.018]  Despite the fact, I would add, that he had control of the House, Senate,
[01:11:29.798 --> 01:11:32.880]  Judiciary and the executive as well as 34 state governors.
[01:11:34.962 --> 01:11:41.026]  Your anointed leader increased federal funding for abortions at home and abroad to record levels.
[01:11:41.967 --> 01:11:44.469]  But the Christian Coalition didn't tell you about that.
[01:11:44.509 --> 01:11:50.754]  They told you about the bait and switch of cutting 80-something million while increasing one package 800 million, another 400 million.
[01:11:51.074 --> 01:11:53.716]  That's a billion, 200 million increaser!
[01:11:58.416 --> 01:12:02.818]  Your pro-family president appointed numerous open homosexuals to high office within the federal government.
[01:12:03.358 --> 01:12:12.181]  And they went after the New Jersey governor, but not after that Republican congressman from California, Mr. Dreyer, who wants to give you a national ID card.
[01:12:12.201 --> 01:12:12.901]  I would add that, too.
[01:12:13.141 --> 01:12:14.602]  You also have selective amnesia.
[01:12:15.382 --> 01:12:20.864]  Your conservative president increased federal spending more than any administration, Republican or Democrat, in modern memory.
[01:12:22.020 --> 01:12:31.787]  This staunch defender of limited government increased the size and scope of the federal government by pushing through Congress legislation creating federal police powers that can only be described as despotic and tyrannical.
[01:12:32.388 --> 01:12:37.331]  Your hero of conservative increased funding for virtually every great society program ever invented.
[01:12:37.792 --> 01:12:45.037]  Increased funding for the Democratic Department of Education, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Legal Services Corporation, etc.
[01:12:45.097 --> 01:12:45.537]  etc.
[01:12:45.597 --> 01:12:46.038]  etc.
[01:12:46.098 --> 01:12:46.498]  etc.
[01:12:46.558 --> 01:12:47.019]  etc.
[01:12:47.519 --> 01:12:48.179]  in infinitum.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:50.281]  This wonderful president
[01:12:51.058 --> 01:12:53.239]  Who desires to keep America safe and secure?
[01:12:54.379 --> 01:13:01.421]  Propose granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens, all of whom are criminals, breaking the law, and many of whom are potential terrorists.
[01:13:02.101 --> 01:13:08.183]  Before you went to sleep for four years, four years ago, gasoline prices averaged less than $1.25 a gallon.
[01:13:08.883 --> 01:13:16.205]  When you recently got out of bed, did you happen to notice that due to President Bush's policies on energy, gas is now exceeding $2 a gallon?
[01:13:18.786 --> 01:13:24.701]  I could tell you much more of what you missed while you were sleeping, but it might only cause you to stay awake.
[01:13:25.387 --> 01:13:34.153]  And we must not let that happen, so have a good four-year snap, and though the boogeyman is gone, I'm sure you'll wake up in time to chase away the next Democratic boogeyman in 08.
[01:13:34.674 --> 01:13:47.623]  Of course, we can't know how many of our liberties will we lose, and how many more unborn babies will be killed, and how many more tax dollars our federal government will be spending by 08, but that's one of the great advantages of being asleep, isn't it?
[01:13:47.903 --> 01:13:51.486]  So goodnight, see you in four years.
[01:13:53.507 --> 01:14:04.833]  Yes, I would add, after a nuke's gone off and smallpox has been released and we're that much deeper inside the New World Order and we've got a national draft called National Compulsory Service.
[01:14:06.354 --> 01:14:11.556]  By the way, the Republicans only had a few extra seats in the Senate and, what, a couple dozen extra in the House.
[01:14:12.657 --> 01:14:15.838]  Now, when they pick up, what, five more Senate seats?
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.041]  Twenty-something more in the House.
[01:14:19.101 --> 01:14:25.403]  I mean, there haven't been majorities like this since the Civil War, when the Republican North installed governments.
[01:14:26.243 --> 01:14:28.644]  So, you don't have any excuse!
[01:14:28.924 --> 01:14:30.405]  I know, I'm an infidel!
[01:14:31.725 --> 01:14:42.929]  Bush, praise to Allah, praise at Shinto shrines, is a member of the most satanic organization ever known, and I snuck in and videotaped where he admittedly was in attendance while he was worshipping Moloch.
[01:14:44.384 --> 01:14:55.268]  And the media and Bush admits he goes there, and they've written autobiographies about how they go there, but since I didn't go up and ask him to take the black hood off his head, they admit I did, so again, you'll just say he wasn't there and it doesn't exist.
[01:14:56.909 --> 01:14:57.429]  I understand.
[01:14:57.909 --> 01:15:07.533]  Any way to rationalize your dollars devalued now by 42% and still plunging, and they're shipping more jobs overseas, but Bush says
[01:15:08.346 --> 01:15:13.170]  Export of jobs is our number one export, and fast food jobs are considered factory jobs now.
[01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:20.135]  So, maybe I should just shut up and say, hey, you can look forward after four years.
[01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:34.966]  I have friends who have four and eight year degrees, top of their class, who five years ago were making $200,000 a year, who now work at H-E-B, and who own lawn services, cutting yards, which is fine.
[01:15:34.986 --> 01:15:37.888]  That's the only way they can put their kids through college.
[01:15:39.250 --> 01:15:43.132]  Or maybe go on a vacation, or maybe have a hot tub in the backyard, maybe not be in debt.
[01:15:44.593 --> 01:15:50.095]  And for the other yuppies that don't know how to work two, three jobs, you're out of luck!
[01:15:50.115 --> 01:15:59.920]  Of course, thirty years ago, just the man could work and put the children through college in a lower middle class job or upper blue collar job.
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:06.323]  And, you know, cars were a couple thousand bucks, houses were fifteen thousand, twenty thousand dollars.
[01:16:06.763 --> 01:16:08.264]  Twenty, thirty years ago, even less than that,
[01:16:08.979 --> 01:16:10.540]  But there's no inflation!
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:16.966]  A car I bought when I was 18 for $15,000 is now $37,000!
[01:16:17.726 --> 01:16:22.450]  Just 15 years later.
[01:16:24.051 --> 01:16:25.252]  But that's okay!
[01:16:25.272 --> 01:16:26.794]  Just shut up, Alex!
[01:16:26.994 --> 01:16:27.434]  Shut up!
[01:16:27.494 --> 01:16:28.515]  There is no inflation!
[01:16:28.555 --> 01:16:30.477]  And okay, the fellow reserves private goods!
[01:16:30.497 --> 01:16:31.257]  It's good for us!
[01:16:31.317 --> 01:16:33.559]  And okay, they are saying they want us to take chips!
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:34.940]  I'll take one!
[01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:37.903]  I've heard you've called in, you've confronted me on the street!
[01:16:40.115 --> 01:16:40.535]  Oh, boy.
[01:16:42.516 --> 01:16:43.897]  Charles in Louisiana.
[01:16:43.937 --> 01:16:44.798]  Charles, welcome.
[01:16:44.818 --> 01:16:45.478]  Thanks for holding.
[01:16:45.998 --> 01:16:46.358]  Yes, sir.
[01:16:46.759 --> 01:16:48.320]  Mr. Jones, I'd like to ask you a question.
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:53.042]  How many votes did the National Constitutional Party get?
[01:16:54.483 --> 01:16:55.403]  I don't have it in front of me.
[01:16:55.443 --> 01:16:56.184]  I saw the rundown.
[01:16:56.224 --> 01:16:57.544]  I think they got a couple million votes.
[01:16:57.785 --> 01:16:58.805]  Did they get a couple million?
[01:16:59.485 --> 01:17:00.346]  Well, that's hopeful.
[01:17:00.956 --> 01:17:06.479]  And another thing, when this national draft comes out, do you think that people might rebel against this?
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:09.021]  No, because it won't be called a draft.
[01:17:09.061 --> 01:17:11.982]  It's like Bush says, anyone who's here is totally legal.
[01:17:12.203 --> 01:17:13.923]  Anyone who can get here is totally legal.
[01:17:14.164 --> 01:17:16.665]  Corporations can pay to bring unskilled and skilled here.
[01:17:16.905 --> 01:17:22.148]  Congressional Budget Office, in the next five years, high-tech layoffs will get seven times what they are.
[01:17:23.969 --> 01:17:26.191]  And he goes, but this is not amnesty!
[01:17:26.491 --> 01:17:28.653]  And they go, oh, it's not amnesty, it's not amnesty!
[01:17:28.693 --> 01:17:33.217]  It's like, I walk up and shoot you five times in the head with a .45 Magnum.
[01:17:33.937 --> 01:17:39.822]  And I go, I did not just shoot you in the head, I loved you in the head, and you go, good, he just loved me, he didn't kill me.
[01:17:40.283 --> 01:17:50.531]  It's the same thing, I mean, that's a ridiculous analogy, but we're going to have compulsory service in the military and domestically to get out of high school, but it's not a draft.
[01:17:51.570 --> 01:17:55.671]  Well, you know what, Mr. Jones, I never really thought the American people were this stupid.
[01:17:56.451 --> 01:17:57.391]  I just can't get over it.
[01:17:57.411 --> 01:18:01.652]  We're going to make troops that have already served 15 years, serve another two years, but that's not a draft!
[01:18:02.172 --> 01:18:02.372]  Yes.
[01:18:02.913 --> 01:18:05.693]  Well, I don't know what it's going to take to wake these people up.
[01:18:06.133 --> 01:18:14.075]  But even though we need to get some television time, start donating money for television time, for everybody listening to this program to do something.
[01:18:14.867 --> 01:18:24.374]  Well, I never really begged for money, but that is an idea, is to start something with products and start infomercials around the country.
[01:18:24.394 --> 01:18:25.515]  That would be a way to get the word out.
[01:18:25.795 --> 01:18:28.237]  It would be wonderful if people would do something.
[01:18:29.078 --> 01:18:29.438]  Something.
[01:18:30.339 --> 01:18:34.342]  We're going to have to do something fast or just give it to them.
[01:18:34.422 --> 01:18:37.544]  I don't know what to do, but I'm willing to fight for it.
[01:18:38.545 --> 01:18:40.046]  Charles, do you have anything else you want to add?
[01:18:40.426 --> 01:18:40.806]  No, sir.
[01:18:40.846 --> 01:18:41.147]  Thank you.
[01:18:41.167 --> 01:18:42.488]  You're welcome to stay over if you want to.
[01:18:42.508 --> 01:18:42.708]  Yes, sir.
[01:18:42.768 --> 01:18:43.288]  I would like to.
[01:18:43.649 --> 01:18:43.909]  Okay.
[01:18:43.929 --> 01:18:44.229]  Stay there.
[01:18:44.881 --> 01:18:46.563]  Then we'll go to David and Carol and others.
[01:18:46.763 --> 01:18:47.604]  More news coming up.
[01:18:48.605 --> 01:18:49.746]  Microchips are good.
[01:18:50.086 --> 01:18:50.767]  Go ahead and take them.
[01:18:53.607 --> 01:18:57.528]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[01:18:57.748 --> 01:19:10.011]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[01:19:10.431 --> 01:19:10.831]  The U.S.
[01:19:10.891 --> 01:19:16.473]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[01:19:16.853 --> 01:19:19.074]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[01:19:20.934 --> 01:19:22.015]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[01:19:22.035 --> 01:19:24.896]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[01:19:24.996 --> 01:19:31.019]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[01:19:31.439 --> 01:19:34.801]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.

[01:20:52.916 --> 01:20:55.419]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[01:20:55.799 --> 01:20:58.722]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[01:20:58.862 --> 01:21:02.526]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush hour traffic every day.
[01:21:02.706 --> 01:21:05.149]  The worst part is there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[01:21:05.309 --> 01:21:08.552]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[01:21:08.752 --> 01:21:16.100]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:18.002]  It's not just a shortwave radio, though.

[01:21:55.579 --> 01:21:58.101]  It's not likely, according to the World Health Organization.
[01:21:58.321 --> 01:22:05.388]  In fact, over one-third of the global population suffers from some form of serious mineral deficiency, leading to all kinds of disease and disability.
[01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:08.871]  That lack of energy you've been blaming on getting older or working too hard?
[01:22:09.131 --> 01:22:11.173]  It's more likely that same mineral deficiency.
[01:22:11.493 --> 01:22:19.320]  And kids who may not be doing as well in school or having a hard time studying ought to be considering a lack of minerals, not necessarily a lack of concentration as the culprit.
[01:22:19.580 --> 01:22:20.861]  Either way, why chance it?
[01:22:20.981 --> 01:22:30.928]  Just a few pennies a day and a toll-free call to Sea Minerals at 877-835-5555, and you're quickly on the road to more energy and a boost to the immune system.

[01:22:35.571 --> 01:22:40.294]  Reclaim that youthful, energetic feeling and restore your good health with the help of minerals from the sea.
[01:22:40.434 --> 01:22:42.295]  Call Sea Minerals today, toll-free, 877-835-5555.
[01:22:42.335 --> 01:22:42.535]  That's 877-835-5555.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:23:06.548]  Alright, going back to Charles in Louisiana.
[01:23:06.609 --> 01:23:07.869]  Charles, how you doing, brother?
[01:23:08.610 --> 01:23:09.950]  I'm doing fair, Mr. Jones.
[01:23:09.990 --> 01:23:11.191]  What else did you want to add?
[01:23:11.571 --> 01:23:17.514]  I wanted to add that everybody listening to this program could donate $10 or $20 and get you some air time.
[01:23:17.834 --> 01:23:19.055]  It's more than listening to this.
[01:23:19.075 --> 01:23:20.716]  We've got to fight this thing, Mr. Jones.
[01:23:21.016 --> 01:23:25.098]  Everybody listening has got to get down to business and get these tapes out and help me with this.
[01:23:25.358 --> 01:23:27.059]  And start fighting this thing.
[01:23:27.759 --> 01:23:29.620]  They're just saying, what can we do?
[01:23:29.880 --> 01:23:30.521]  It's too big.
[01:23:30.861 --> 01:23:31.821]  So what if it's too big?
[01:23:32.042 --> 01:23:33.102]  I'd rather go down fighting.
[01:23:33.142 --> 01:23:34.963]  Even if we lose, I'd rather go down fighting.
[01:23:35.984 --> 01:23:36.624]  Well, look.
[01:23:36.704 --> 01:23:38.865]  I mean, I don't think people need to donate anything to me.
[01:23:38.905 --> 01:23:42.867]  They need to tell folks how they listen to the show, whether it's on AM, FM, shortwave, internet.
[01:23:43.288 --> 01:23:45.809]  Support other talk show hosts that tell the truth as well.
[01:23:46.816 --> 01:23:57.505]  At the same time, my videos are a great tool because as you've done, Charles, you can get them, make copies of them, very inexpensively, and then circumvent the mainstream media.
[01:23:57.945 --> 01:24:05.331]  And the powerful thing about our information is the globalists have to keep reapplying their lies over and over again
[01:24:05.911 --> 01:24:14.313]  For people that have open minds, we've just got to tell them the truth once, then they have the blinders taken off, they see it for themselves, and then they're off and running waking up others.
[01:24:14.713 --> 01:24:23.294]  I mean, you've called in over the years a few times, and you've talked about, what response have you gotten with my videos with people that you give them to?
[01:24:25.275 --> 01:24:29.436]  Everybody looks at the tape, they wake up, but they're just going to do anything.
[01:24:29.796 --> 01:24:31.116]  They believe the tape, they know it's true.
[01:24:31.897 --> 01:24:33.218]  I'll give them other tapes after that.
[01:24:33.239 --> 01:24:36.442]  I'll give them my number to call me back if they want another tape.
[01:24:36.862 --> 01:24:38.244]  Just about everybody calls me.
[01:24:38.264 --> 01:24:39.305]  I see people in the store.
[01:24:39.505 --> 01:24:40.666]  Do you have any more tapes?
[01:24:41.047 --> 01:24:42.468]  I said, you know, do you hear?
[01:24:42.508 --> 01:24:43.629]  Can you get my mother some tapes?
[01:24:43.670 --> 01:24:45.552]  I had a policeman stop me five days ago.
[01:24:46.132 --> 01:24:47.974]  A two foot motorcycle policeman.
[01:24:47.994 --> 01:24:49.576]  He gave me ten hours to get some more tapes.
[01:24:49.656 --> 01:24:50.377]  So help me God.
[01:24:50.797 --> 01:24:52.399]  They stopped me on the street.
[01:24:53.468 --> 01:24:55.869]  And how many copies have you made in the last four or five years?
[01:24:55.889 --> 01:24:58.049]  Well, I almost quit counting, but it's over 5,000.
[01:24:58.210 --> 01:24:59.890]  I don't have my book in front of me.
[01:24:59.970 --> 01:25:00.750]  It's over 5,000.
[01:25:01.050 --> 01:25:03.811]  Since 1999, I've made over 5,000 copies.
[01:25:04.571 --> 01:25:05.252]  Of my videos.
[01:25:05.312 --> 01:25:07.993]  Now, what you're saying is absolutely correct.
[01:25:08.633 --> 01:25:15.895]  What I have found in the thousands of interviews I've done on other talk shows and traveling the country on my own talk show
[01:25:16.701 --> 01:25:19.583]  Is five, six years ago, half the people didn't believe me.
[01:25:19.883 --> 01:25:22.425]  But then they saw everything I talked about come true.
[01:25:23.066 --> 01:25:28.750]  Now about 90% of the people I talk to admit it's going on, but they do one of three things.
[01:25:28.770 --> 01:25:32.092]  Either they say, okay, and make excuses of how all this is good.
[01:25:32.453 --> 01:25:33.834]  Okay, world government is good.
[01:25:34.694 --> 01:25:35.775]  Taking chips is good.
[01:25:35.795 --> 01:25:38.157]  Face scanning cameras, tracking this is good.
[01:25:38.617 --> 01:25:39.718]  Open borders is good.
[01:25:41.099 --> 01:25:42.280]  That's the vast minority.
[01:25:42.740 --> 01:25:45.322]  Most of them go, it's horrible, you know, 75%
[01:25:47.043 --> 01:25:47.263]  About 90%.
[01:25:47.383 --> 01:25:48.804]  It's horrible.
[01:25:48.824 --> 01:25:49.744]  We've got to do something.
[01:25:49.764 --> 01:25:50.505]  This is terrible.
[01:25:50.565 --> 01:25:51.265]  What are we going to do?
[01:25:52.146 --> 01:25:53.326]  There's nothing we can do.
[01:25:53.906 --> 01:25:58.569]  And then about 10% of that says, we're going to take action.
[01:25:58.609 --> 01:25:59.429]  We can do something.
[01:25:59.489 --> 01:26:03.091]  So people have already taken the first step of waking up.
[01:26:03.812 --> 01:26:06.735]  But now they're afraid and want to go climb in a hole somewhere.
[01:26:06.815 --> 01:26:07.095]  No!
[01:26:07.455 --> 01:26:09.377]  We're human beings, or we men are mice.
[01:26:09.877 --> 01:26:10.898]  You know, women are mice.
[01:26:11.499 --> 01:26:18.505]  We've got to stand up and say no and get involved at every level, educating the other people that have not yet heard the truth.
[01:26:18.765 --> 01:26:19.826]  Thanks for the call, Charles.
[01:26:19.906 --> 01:26:20.246]  Thank you.
[01:26:20.306 --> 01:26:20.847]  God bless you.
[01:26:21.067 --> 01:26:21.827]  Yeah.
[01:26:21.927 --> 01:26:23.148]  Well, God bless you, my friend.
[01:26:23.209 --> 01:26:26.631]  I mean, I know only of a few others that have done what you've done.
[01:26:26.712 --> 01:26:28.273]  I mean, made tens of thousands of copies.
[01:26:29.231 --> 01:26:30.252]  We need more out there.
[01:26:30.272 --> 01:26:30.933]  We need more copies.
[01:26:50.339 --> 01:26:59.504]  Again, I call up congressmen, congresswomen, I call up state reps, I call up doctors, you know, some doctors standing up against the Patriot Act, say in Louisiana or Vermont.
[01:26:59.964 --> 01:27:02.646]  I call them up and go, I'd like to have you on, you're trying to fight the Patriot Act.
[01:27:02.666 --> 01:27:03.787]  He goes, Alex Jones!
[01:27:04.047 --> 01:27:05.908]  I'm fighting it because I saw your video!
[01:27:06.728 --> 01:27:08.390]  Or, you know, congressmen and women.
[01:27:08.430 --> 01:27:09.391]  Yeah, I saw your film.
[01:27:09.431 --> 01:27:10.892]  My constituents call a lot about it.
[01:27:10.912 --> 01:27:11.553]  Thank God.
[01:27:11.733 --> 01:27:13.815]  Or, you know, I talk to some lawyers suing the government for 9-11.
[01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:15.256]  They go, oh, I'm doing this.
[01:27:16.697 --> 01:27:21.061]  My plaintiffs' victims' families are doing this because they woke up from your videos.
[01:27:21.822 --> 01:27:22.643]  That isn't me.
[01:27:22.863 --> 01:27:23.824]  I make the videos.
[01:27:23.864 --> 01:27:27.067]  But you are what gave it legs and what gave it power.
[01:27:27.127 --> 01:27:27.848]  And God bless you.
[01:27:28.068 --> 01:27:29.069]  Thanks for the call, Charles.
[01:27:30.655 --> 01:27:30.875]  Hi Alex.
[01:27:30.895 --> 01:27:32.756]  I was watching CNN before your show started.
[01:27:32.836 --> 01:27:35.417]  They were doing kind of a play-by-play about the Fallujah thing.
[01:27:58.972 --> 01:28:08.715]  They had this lady on who's over there, I guess, and, uh, you know, they asked her why they're going in at night, and she said, well, the insurgents don't have, uh, night vision, and our guys do.
[01:28:09.415 --> 01:28:19.899]  And, uh, that was basically her reason, and I'm thinking, well, yeah, and also, they won't be able to tell women from men, you know, because it'll just be some outlined shadow-looking person.
[01:28:20.919 --> 01:28:21.259]  And, uh,
[01:28:22.105 --> 01:28:23.626]  The whole thing is... Well, I'll tell you what.
[01:28:23.666 --> 01:28:24.866]  Talk about when we get back, David.
[01:28:24.886 --> 01:28:25.867]  You're absolutely right.
[01:28:26.887 --> 01:28:28.328]  I've interviewed the troops that came back.
[01:28:28.888 --> 01:28:30.889]  And they just go in, kill everybody.
[01:28:34.211 --> 01:28:36.312]  Well, that's the kind of stuff Saddam did, folks.
[01:28:36.352 --> 01:28:39.093]  But why is it bad when he does it, but good when we do it?
[01:28:39.113 --> 01:28:40.033]  This is double-think.
[01:28:40.073 --> 01:28:41.034]  This is mental illness.
[01:28:41.334 --> 01:28:41.814]  We'll be back.
[01:28:43.635 --> 01:28:44.535]  We're on the march.
[01:28:45.035 --> 01:28:46.636]  The empire's on the run.
[01:28:47.557 --> 01:28:50.238]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:28:53.251 --> 01:28:55.913]  How do you feel when you pull up to the gas pump to fill up your car?
[01:28:56.193 --> 01:28:58.214]  I'm Patrick T. Parker from Barclay Financial.
[01:28:58.395 --> 01:29:00.356]  The real estate market's been going through the roof.
[01:29:00.656 --> 01:29:03.278]  Auto sales are brisk, and they say there isn't inflation.
[01:29:03.438 --> 01:29:08.421]  Commodity prices are on the rise due to not only demand from the U.S., but India, China, the Pacific Rim.
[01:29:08.461 --> 01:29:10.623]  In fact, we're seeing global economic expansion.
[01:29:10.803 --> 01:29:13.425]  Do you know how to take advantage of rising or falling interest rates?
[01:29:13.585 --> 01:29:19.789]  Do you know how to take advantage of price movements in items like copper for housing and auto industries, grains, cotton, interest rates, and more?
[01:29:20.009 --> 01:29:26.656]  Are you aware that the dollar value of exchange traded commodities exceeds that of the American and New York Stock Exchanges combined daily?
[01:29:26.876 --> 01:29:31.180]  The commodities markets are a mystery to most people and involve substantial risk of loss.
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:33.923]  In fact, people can and do lose money trading commodities.
[01:29:34.083 --> 01:29:37.847]  Inflation is on the rise and that creates opportunity in today's commodities market.

[01:30:09.921 --> 01:30:14.145]  Cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:30:14.425 --> 01:30:18.369]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[01:30:18.589 --> 01:30:25.115]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[01:30:25.335 --> 01:30:30.840]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lake streams and stagnant ponds.
[01:30:31.061 --> 01:30:35.665]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system.
[01:30:35.885 --> 01:30:37.986]  So it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[01:30:53.576 --> 01:31:01.759]  You love your pet, and when your dog or cat starts to suffer from the debilitating effects of arthritis, you want to do everything possible to bring back their energy and spirit.
[01:31:01.959 --> 01:31:09.262]  Now, both you and your pet can benefit from a revolutionary natural approach to overcoming arthritic problems induced by aging with Pet Wonder.
[01:31:09.422 --> 01:31:18.586]  Pet Wonder contains glucosamine sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, and shark cartilage, the three top natural ingredients for fighting arthritic problems, particularly inflammation and pain.
[01:31:18.846 --> 01:31:26.251]  Pet Wonder has no side effects, caused a fraction of many pharmaceutical or veterinarian procedures, and results are often seen in just a few days.
[01:31:26.532 --> 01:31:31.815]  Pet Wonder can help change the degeneration of your pet's health and rejuvenate both its health and happiness.

[01:31:56.485 --> 01:31:58.986]  Don't worry, this show is documented.
[01:31:59.486 --> 01:32:02.246]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:32:02.787 --> 01:32:08.408]  Talk about getting in plain view.
[01:32:09.068 --> 01:32:14.189]  About two years ago in Afghanistan, a member of the U.S.
[01:32:14.289 --> 01:32:16.370]  Army, a Gruckheimer,
[01:32:17.375 --> 01:32:19.136]  Was his last name, told the Ithaca Journal.
[01:32:19.576 --> 01:32:23.038]  Yeah, well, we don't worry about, you know, if they're Taliban or Al Qaeda.
[01:32:23.058 --> 01:32:26.940]  We just, uh, we go into whole towns and kill men, women, children.
[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:28.701]  We just go in and kill everyone.
[01:32:30.762 --> 01:32:32.122]  That's what the Nazis did, folks.
[01:32:34.343 --> 01:32:37.045]  And then the Pentagon came out and clarified this.
[01:32:37.085 --> 01:32:38.365]  They said, well, we're clarifying.
[01:32:38.405 --> 01:32:40.807]  Yes, in certain areas, certain zones, we do kill everyone.
[01:32:40.827 --> 01:32:43.648]  They went, oh, it's clarified that it's okay.
[01:32:45.814 --> 01:32:49.035]  Again, that's what Saddam Hussein, trained by the globalists, did in his country.
[01:32:49.375 --> 01:32:52.716]  That's what the type of stuff Bin Laden, when he was fighting the Russians, did with the Russians.
[01:32:53.036 --> 01:32:54.837]  They'd go into a Russian base and kill everybody.
[01:32:56.097 --> 01:32:59.878]  That's the kind of stuff that all of these allies do, and now I guess we do it.
[01:33:01.519 --> 01:33:05.680]  Now, I'm against the globalist allies of some of Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, and the rest of them.
[01:33:05.860 --> 01:33:07.741]  We're supposed to conveniently forget about all that.
[01:33:09.634 --> 01:33:14.256]  And so, yeah, the Battle of Fallujah is going on right now, and they've... I've got video of it.
[01:33:14.276 --> 01:33:17.197]  They're openly bombarding it with heavy artillery, with bombs.
[01:33:17.637 --> 01:33:29.041]  They're strafing it with Puff the Magic Dragon, what they call a C-130 with howitzer cannons in it and Vulcan Gatling guns hanging out the sides.
[01:33:29.941 --> 01:33:32.582]  They're just flying around splattering stuff a few months ago.
[01:33:32.602 --> 01:33:37.664]  A couple hundred people are running down the middle of the street in Fallujah towards some burning U.S.
[01:33:37.704 --> 01:33:38.144]  vehicles.
[01:33:41.095 --> 01:33:42.696]  They're about a mile away just running towards it.
[01:33:42.736 --> 01:33:52.780]  Oh yes, I'm sure the insurgents blow up the vehicles, run off into the shadows, and then appear again a mile away and then get in the street running down the middle of the street towards it.
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:55.441]  Oh, you're running towards our burning vehicles.
[01:33:55.941 --> 01:33:56.741]  We'll just kill you.
[01:33:56.821 --> 01:33:58.242]  I mean, obviously innocent people.
[01:33:59.843 --> 01:34:04.084]  And then Neocon's got a hold of the video and put it on TV and said, well, what's the big deal?
[01:34:04.124 --> 01:34:05.665]  You know, look at them running down the street.
[01:34:08.473 --> 01:34:25.079]  So I guess if a car blows up or something down the street from your house, from a gas fire or whatever, we should expect, or if in the future there's ever a terror attack and there's some burning vehicles, and you run out of your house to run down the street to see what's happening, maybe we should have C-130s flying around.
[01:34:25.099 --> 01:34:26.839]  They should just kill everybody in the street!
[01:34:26.859 --> 01:34:36.903]  Of course, we're using the C-130s right now, and F-15s, and 16s, and A-10s, but in the
[01:34:38.044 --> 01:34:43.245]  Case with Fallujah a few months ago was a F-16 dropping a thousand pound bomb on them.
[01:34:44.425 --> 01:34:48.626]  We got the video shot by from the helicopters of people walking around.
[01:34:49.887 --> 01:34:52.567]  They start machine gunning and they're not even sure of their insurgents.
[01:34:53.507 --> 01:34:54.508]  We've had the troops on.
[01:34:54.768 --> 01:34:56.588]  We're told to shoot first, ask questions later.
[01:34:56.848 --> 01:34:59.449]  You know, trash truck guys out driving around picking up the trash.
[01:35:00.809 --> 01:35:01.769]  Troops see the vehicles.
[01:35:01.829 --> 01:35:02.670]  Oh, those are trucks!
[01:35:02.750 --> 01:35:03.290]  Blow them up!
[01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:04.530]  Oh, we ordered them
[01:35:05.447 --> 01:35:15.695]  Our general ordered them, this is a group we're paying to pick up trash from our different barracks, but they came by to pick up trash and we killed everybody.
[01:35:16.216 --> 01:35:26.044]  Oh, but that could have been an accident friendly fire, but when they were on the ground pleading, please don't kill me, please don't kill me, they meant they even had Arab speaking marines there, please don't kill me.
[01:35:26.804 --> 01:35:30.407]  The guy had his legs blown off and they just started shooting him in the head.
[01:35:31.968 --> 01:35:34.911]  There was a fight between the soldiers and one of those soldiers was a traitor.
[01:35:35.518 --> 01:35:40.799]  He didn't agree with shooting people that worked for us in the head for no reason after we'd blown their legs off.
[01:35:41.539 --> 01:35:43.100]  And so I think that guy should be put in a camp.
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:48.501]  You know, according to people like Michael Savage, if you disagree with anything, you should be put in a camp, a forced labor camp.
[01:35:50.021 --> 01:35:51.841]  But David in Illinois, finish up what you were saying.
[01:35:52.761 --> 01:35:54.042]  Yeah.
[01:35:54.522 --> 01:36:00.163]  So they're basically saying on CNN that there's going to be a lot of civilian casualties and
[01:36:01.668 --> 01:36:05.291]  Olawi and our governments all accepted it, and it's all good.
[01:36:08.134 --> 01:36:13.878]  I came home, and I got on the internet, and I go to Yahoo, and I get a first story.
[01:36:13.898 --> 01:36:21.325]  It says, out of the 300,000 people in Fallujah, half of them probably left.
[01:36:21.885 --> 01:36:28.771]  So then I click on something else, and I click back, and that story's gone and replaced by a smaller story with a lot less information.
[01:36:29.606 --> 01:36:31.908]  It's saying, oh, 80 to 90 percent left.
[01:36:32.488 --> 01:36:35.751]  And, um, it's just, you know, lie after lie.
[01:36:35.791 --> 01:36:37.832]  Just like when they had the phony troop.
[01:36:37.852 --> 01:36:38.693]  Well, you know, that's funny.
[01:36:38.753 --> 01:36:44.457]  I've got an article from last Friday saying they said leave, and then they put a cordon around the city where you can't.
[01:36:45.038 --> 01:36:49.481]  And then a lot of those, when you come out of a checkpoint, they search you and take you to one of 32 camps.
[01:36:49.981 --> 01:36:52.143]  Even the Pentagon's own general
[01:36:53.027 --> 01:37:09.940]  What, six months ago, the Togumbo Report said that 70 to 90% of those picked up at checkpoints are families who didn't have their papers in order, and they're quote, taken for re-education and internment and interrogation.
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:13.523]  And then they admit they beat Daddy to death in front of Mommy, they rape Mommy,
[01:37:14.224 --> 01:37:19.987]  And then they beat him to death and pose over their dead bodies, and then Rush Limbaugh says, blowing off some steam, folks!
[01:37:20.367 --> 01:37:23.548]  When Ted Bundy grabs people and beats them to death, I guess he's blowing off steam.
[01:37:24.148 --> 01:37:28.890]  Well, they had an ex-general on there, and they were saying, so what's going to happen to all these civilians?
[01:37:29.351 --> 01:37:32.132]  And he basically said, well, I guess we're going to have to detain them all.
[01:37:32.332 --> 01:37:33.312]  And he said all of them.
[01:37:35.337 --> 01:37:37.998]  It's just, you know, another big lie.
[01:37:38.058 --> 01:37:39.679]  Hey, but it's good practice for our troops.
[01:37:39.719 --> 01:37:41.940]  How to detain over 100,000 people.
[01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:44.182]  We believe their number is 200-something thousand left.
[01:37:44.702 --> 01:37:45.562]  It's a great way.
[01:37:45.662 --> 01:37:46.503]  It's loving.
[01:37:47.183 --> 01:37:47.863]  You tell them to leave.
[01:37:47.883 --> 01:37:50.625]  You put them in nice giant camps out in the middle of the desert.
[01:37:51.105 --> 01:37:51.965]  Maybe a few tents.
[01:37:51.985 --> 01:37:53.726]  Then you go and interrogate and have fun.
[01:37:54.207 --> 01:37:56.087]  These troops will come back and be cops here.
[01:37:56.308 --> 01:37:56.928]  It's going to be great.
[01:37:57.549 --> 01:37:57.809]  Yeah.
[01:37:58.069 --> 01:37:59.890]  By the way, guys, do you have that audio clip?
[01:37:59.910 --> 01:38:00.830]  Can you find that one?
[01:38:01.330 --> 01:38:05.571]  John, where they run over the guy's car, because I think he stole three sticks of firewood.
[01:38:05.591 --> 01:38:08.992]  Yeah, and then they laugh and machine gun the vehicle.
[01:38:09.172 --> 01:38:10.493]  You ever heard us play that clip, David?
[01:38:11.033 --> 01:38:11.393]  Oh, yeah.
[01:38:11.453 --> 01:38:13.454]  Hey, Alex, did you see the October 19th...
[01:38:14.915 --> 01:38:17.476]  Little news story that the Defense Department came out with.
[01:38:17.856 --> 01:38:21.457]  It says, study finds little risk from depleted uranium particles.
[01:38:21.617 --> 01:38:24.918]  Well, it's just like how they found that mercury is actually good for your brain now.
[01:38:25.198 --> 01:38:31.780]  Yeah, it's just, it's all, it's like, it's more lies than truth coming out now, and it's like they don't even care anymore.
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:39.862]  Yeah, antidepressants, three or four of them at the same time are good for your children, despite the fact their own studies show it increases suicide massively and causes all types of
[01:38:40.899 --> 01:38:42.520]  Mental problems and physical problems.
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:43.881]  They tell you Ritalin is great.
[01:38:44.702 --> 01:38:48.084]  The same people that tell you sodium fluoride is good for your water.
[01:38:49.585 --> 01:38:50.466]  Thanks for the call, David.
[01:38:53.188 --> 01:38:53.948]  I did see that.
[01:38:53.968 --> 01:38:57.231]  Forget the fact that Dr. Rocky wrote the book for them at Los Alamos.
[01:38:57.671 --> 01:38:59.532]  Was sent there in 1990 to clean it up.
[01:38:59.592 --> 01:39:00.633]  Most of his team has died.
[01:39:00.673 --> 01:39:02.955]  He's had cancer in his nasal passages.
[01:39:04.256 --> 01:39:07.118]  They admit it causes heavy metal poisoning and radiation poisoning.
[01:39:08.706 --> 01:39:13.350]  New York Daily News had a private lab in New York test the blood of 15 troops.
[01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:16.532]  Just every one of them they tested so they were sick from it.
[01:39:16.552 --> 01:39:29.242]  It had upwards of two rims of radiation in them, which DU is not supposed to have, but as usual the people using the depleted rods and the different byproducts are using a little bit higher grade.
[01:39:30.976 --> 01:39:36.920]  And this time they didn't just bombard the outskirts of cities where tanks were blown up by A-10 Warthogs.
[01:39:37.281 --> 01:39:44.786]  Now it's in the Bradley fighting vehicles, Abrams, Warthog tanks, Warthog jets, excuse me, and Abrams M1A battle tanks.
[01:39:45.869 --> 01:39:55.337]  Now they use it and they bombarded almost every Republican Guard stronghold and city structure and buildings and power plants and universities and telecommunications centers and water plants.
[01:39:55.777 --> 01:40:04.524]  And now those are all bad and our troops are guarding them in it and they're sick and dead and dying and they admit they take them to Germany for treatment and have them quarantine and just let them die.
[01:40:07.126 --> 01:40:08.947]  But again, you've got to support the troops.
[01:40:09.367 --> 01:40:13.751]  And supporting the troops means not caring about them and waving a plastic Chinese-American flag.
[01:40:15.214 --> 01:40:18.036]  Carol in Oklahoma, thanks for holding her on the air, go ahead.
[01:40:18.576 --> 01:40:19.176]  Hi Alex.
[01:40:20.817 --> 01:40:38.005]  Staying in the mode of your don't just curse the darkness but light a candle, we have a way to vote with our pocketbooks in a very meaningful way against the homosexual group lobbies and the power that they have through that human rights organization.
[01:40:38.946 --> 01:40:42.568]  There is a group that we buy products from a lot that
[01:40:43.883 --> 01:40:54.032]  There's quite a lot of products, as a matter of fact, that they produce and they have openly slammed traditional marriage and endorsed homosexuals.
[01:40:54.092 --> 01:40:55.273]  Are you talking about Target?
[01:40:55.953 --> 01:40:58.115]  No, it's Procter & Gamble.
[01:40:59.316 --> 01:41:07.243]  Crest toothpaste, Tide soap, Pampers, Downy, Softner, Old Spice... Hey, Target has kicked the
[01:41:09.156 --> 01:41:14.859]  The Salvation Army, which has got plenty of problems, folks, and is a neocon outfit, but at least it does some real charity.
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:17.741]  Unlike United Way, where your money goes to gun control groups.
[01:41:18.201 --> 01:41:18.722]  Right.
[01:41:18.922 --> 01:41:20.783]  And the Red Cross is just as bad.
[01:41:21.403 --> 01:41:26.386]  But now Target in San Antonio and other cities has kicked the bell ringers off their front steps.
[01:41:27.327 --> 01:41:34.871]  Well, um... Procter & Gamble, um... They're also, by the way, instrumental in pushing the RFID.
[01:41:35.772 --> 01:41:38.173]  Yeah, and they, um... uh...
[01:41:38.880 --> 01:41:46.481]  Have given large amounts of money to this human rights, which is a misnomer for the group in the first place because it is a homosexual group, lobby group.
[01:41:47.223 --> 01:41:54.648]  But there's no telling how many people have given money to that group, thinking they were giving it for really human rights, when it's really a homosexual lobby group.
[01:41:54.888 --> 01:42:00.911]  Well, what they've done is, again, they know that conservatives care about this subject, and it is an important issue.
[01:42:00.931 --> 01:42:03.613]  Homosexuals have their rights in this country.
[01:42:04.093 --> 01:42:11.358]  What they want is extra rights for some of them to recruit in the schools and to do all this, and they shouldn't be able to.
[01:42:11.378 --> 01:42:14.820]  And marriage is an institution between a man and a woman.
[01:42:15.380 --> 01:42:18.622]  But the Republicans and Democrats, they themselves don't care about it.
[01:42:18.962 --> 01:42:24.604]  They know it's a political football, so they focus on that, while not focusing on all the other big issues.
[01:42:24.844 --> 01:42:27.265]  Because they've got to have something to fight over.
[01:42:27.466 --> 01:42:31.207]  They're 100% together on everything else, so they create issues like this.
[01:42:31.567 --> 01:42:39.411]  This is a real way that we can vote with our pocketbooks, not just at the ballot box, and make them feel it financially, because
[01:42:40.398 --> 01:42:54.565]  Procter & Gamble, Levi Strauss, American Express have all come out pro-homosexual and against, as you recall, Procter & Gamble pulled their commercial support from Dr. Laura because of her pro-life and anti-homosexual stance.
[01:42:54.585 --> 01:42:56.826]  Well, what Dr. Laura did was read the 1999 American Psychological Association
[01:43:01.898 --> 01:43:08.160]  A public briefing where they said, well, in 1969 we took homosexuality off the list of mental illness.
[01:43:08.260 --> 01:43:12.201]  Now it's time to say that pedophilia is normal and good for children.
[01:43:13.302 --> 01:43:17.623]  And because, I mean, that's not a very radical statement of her to say, how dare them, and to read that on the air.
[01:43:18.083 --> 01:43:20.124]  And she was boycotted and attacked for that.
[01:43:20.544 --> 01:43:29.667]  Yeah, well, you know, the insiders paid Alfred Kinsey and that bunch out there that were proven to be pedophiles to promote
[01:43:30.495 --> 01:43:35.899]  The psychology that homosexuality is really an inborn deal.
[01:43:35.959 --> 01:43:36.799]  It's not a choice.
[01:43:37.800 --> 01:43:38.901]  You're really just born that way.
[01:43:38.961 --> 01:43:47.747]  Now, I know there are deformity people, but they are a tiny, tiny, minute number.
[01:43:48.867 --> 01:43:50.889]  We know some have been done that way from
[01:43:51.485 --> 01:43:53.707]  What we need to do, Alex, is call our Republican
[01:44:19.224 --> 01:44:19.584]  I don't know.
[01:44:38.095 --> 01:44:42.078]  Rather conservative Senators now in Tom Coburn and James Inhofe.
[01:44:42.138 --> 01:44:43.939]  And there are some others that got elected.
[01:44:44.299 --> 01:44:46.040]  There are a few others up there.
[01:44:46.321 --> 01:44:59.369]  What we need to do now is really put pressure on them to not allow or not to vote for Arlen Specter as the head of that judicial committee because he is the one who blocked Judge Bork's... No, I know, and that's why Bush loves him.
[01:44:59.389 --> 01:44:59.950]  Thanks for the call.
[01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:07.432]  And that's why Judge Roy Moore, Bush, took the Attorney General that went after Moore and promoted him to a federal judgeship.
[01:45:08.212 --> 01:45:10.152]  I mean, can't you people see what's going on here?
[01:45:10.572 --> 01:45:13.013]  They can't get their agenda through with Kerry.
[01:45:13.353 --> 01:45:15.013]  That's why I supported Kerry.
[01:45:15.993 --> 01:45:20.794]  And I supported him indirectly by supporting the Constitution Party because I have a moral stance.
[01:45:20.914 --> 01:45:22.075]  I don't compromise with evil.
[01:45:22.675 --> 01:45:25.915]  And if Kerry would have won, there's no way they'd get away with any of this.
[01:45:27.816 --> 01:45:28.796]  But that didn't happen.
[01:45:29.958 --> 01:45:35.662]  And now Bush has this giant majority in the legislative, in the judicial, and the executive.
[01:45:36.183 --> 01:45:37.684]  Not just federally, but the state level.
[01:45:38.344 --> 01:45:46.490]  And you're going to see a reign of terror, a reign of abortion, a reign of gun control, a reign of open borders and amnesty, a reign of U.N.
[01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.951]  funding.
[01:45:47.631 --> 01:45:48.612]  And you're going to love it!
[01:45:49.492 --> 01:45:50.573]  You're going to thank him.
[01:45:51.694 --> 01:45:52.955]  You're going to appreciate it.
[01:45:55.012 --> 01:45:55.452]  It's sick.
[01:45:55.473 --> 01:45:56.413]  No Carol, I hear you.
[01:45:56.433 --> 01:45:58.915]  We need to... You know what?
[01:45:58.975 --> 01:45:59.416]  Call them.
[01:45:59.536 --> 01:45:59.956]  Fight them.
[01:46:00.337 --> 01:46:01.938]  Try to stop him from being put in there.
[01:46:02.038 --> 01:46:08.524]  You may be able to do it, but they'll put some other lesser-known senator who will also have a pro-death voting record in there.
[01:46:08.544 --> 01:46:09.064]  Just watch!
[01:46:09.484 --> 01:46:10.125]  Just learn.
[01:46:10.745 --> 01:46:11.266]  Just watch.
[01:46:11.806 --> 01:46:16.350]  They are committed to their skull and bones sacrificing.
[01:46:16.811 --> 01:46:17.491]  That's what this is.
[01:46:18.212 --> 01:46:19.413]  They are committed to it.
[01:46:19.453 --> 01:46:20.634]  This is what they live for.
[01:46:21.693 --> 01:46:30.758]  We're going to break and come back with more news and more of your calls at 1-800-259-9231.
[01:46:30.778 --> 01:46:31.759]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:33.600]  And you know what?
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:34.721]  I just want to read this again.
[01:46:34.741 --> 01:46:36.422]  It was so good.
[01:46:36.442 --> 01:46:40.404]  Next hour I'm going to speed through it again.
[01:46:40.424 --> 01:46:47.248]  It's so good I'm going to read it again but add more comments to Chuck Baldwin's Christians and Conservatives and go back to sleep now because the boogeyman has left the building.
[01:46:48.329 --> 01:46:49.069]  Boogeyman has left.
[01:46:49.795 --> 01:46:53.097]  And then I've got this other article here, American Sunset.
[01:46:54.718 --> 01:46:58.400]  Oh, the gnashing of teeth, the beating of breasts, the wailing of woe.
[01:46:59.901 --> 01:47:01.562]  Bush and the Republicans stole the election.
[01:47:01.602 --> 01:47:02.562]  Big surprise, eh?
[01:47:02.622 --> 01:47:04.944]  The neocon Nazis have done nothing but break the law.
[01:47:05.244 --> 01:47:06.485]  This is before they ever took office.
[01:47:07.185 --> 01:47:09.626]  You were expecting fair play from them, perhaps?
[01:47:10.087 --> 01:47:10.607]  Perchance?
[01:47:11.808 --> 01:47:13.589]  But we'll be going over that after the break.
[01:47:15.549 --> 01:47:19.432]  We'll take more of your calls too in the next hour.
[01:47:19.452 --> 01:47:19.812]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:47:21.413 --> 01:47:29.138]  Before I go any further, I guess since we've been doing the broadcast down here for an hour and 48 minutes and 35 seconds, I might as well plug my videos at least once.
[01:47:30.198 --> 01:47:31.399]  I've made 11 films.
[01:47:31.539 --> 01:47:32.380]  They're all excellent.
[01:47:32.420 --> 01:47:35.962]  Two 9-11 films, 9-11 Road to Tyranny and The Masters of Terror Exposed.
[01:47:36.322 --> 01:47:38.323]  My 9-11 book, 9-11 Ascent to Tyranny.
[01:47:38.684 --> 01:47:40.565]  My newest films are Matrix of Evil and
[01:47:41.821 --> 01:47:44.424]  American Dictators documenting the staged election of 2004.
[01:47:44.944 --> 01:48:05.924]  And I'm offering the 9-11 Inside Job Special, where you get my two 9-11 videos, George Humphrey's 9-11 video, all full-length features, Eric Huffman's 9-11 video, and Paul Watson's 330-something page Order Out of Chaos, a lead sponsor of Terror and the New World Order book.
[01:48:06.474 --> 01:48:09.957]  Four videos and one book for $59.95.
[01:48:10.458 --> 01:48:12.500]  That's a $53 savings.
[01:48:13.421 --> 01:48:15.123]  And it's only good through December 20th.
[01:48:16.364 --> 01:48:22.970]  And you may already own some of those great videos in that book, but get the package special to give them as gifts.
[01:48:23.451 --> 01:48:25.613]  The gift of knowledge to unlock minds.
[01:48:26.553 --> 01:48:28.595]  Don't want to give somebody just a copy of one of my videos?
[01:48:29.075 --> 01:48:29.775]  You can do that too.
[01:48:29.795 --> 01:48:30.316]  I hope you do.
[01:48:30.376 --> 01:48:30.856]  Make copies.
[01:48:31.317 --> 01:48:34.999]  Give them a nice color cover with a stamp on top of the DVD or the VHS.
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:35.820]  Give them that.
[01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:36.741]  Give them a nice book.
[01:48:38.022 --> 01:48:42.105]  You can get my almost three hour 9-11 Road Attorney DVD for $24.95.
[01:48:42.645 --> 01:48:46.888]  Each additional copy $5.95 for a limited time.
[01:48:47.549 --> 01:48:53.333]  For a limited time, document in the staged election, American Dictators, so people understand what happened.
[01:48:54.217 --> 01:48:55.858]  We predicted it months before.
[01:48:56.958 --> 01:48:58.559]  Each copy, $19.95.
[01:48:59.439 --> 01:49:01.100]  Additional copies, $5.95.
[01:49:01.180 --> 01:49:02.080]  American Dictators.
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:06.622]  That's on the shopping cart at Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.

[01:49:34.389 --> 01:49:42.031]  Give them a gift, a monthly subscription to presentplanet.tv where they can watch all my videos, read my book, read Paul Watson's book, my weekly reports.
[01:49:42.631 --> 01:49:45.532]  Give yourself the gift of presentplanet.tv.
[01:49:45.832 --> 01:49:47.272]  Give your son or daughter, your neighbor.
[01:49:48.399 --> 01:49:49.980]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:49:50.060 --> 01:49:50.961]  Stay with us.
[01:49:51.021 --> 01:49:51.921]  A lot more coming up.
[01:49:53.442 --> 01:49:53.983]  Hey, folks.
[01:49:54.083 --> 01:49:54.903]  Alex Jones here.
[01:49:54.923 --> 01:50:00.287]  And I'm very excited to announce the release of my bombshell documentary film, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny, on DVD.
[01:50:00.607 --> 01:50:01.327]  That's right, folks.
[01:50:01.387 --> 01:50:01.988]  DVD.
[01:50:02.168 --> 01:50:04.389]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[01:50:04.529 --> 01:50:06.631]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[01:50:06.891 --> 01:50:11.814]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[01:50:12.174 --> 01:50:16.217]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[01:50:16.437 --> 01:50:18.218]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[01:50:18.298 --> 01:50:28.946]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and pliable microchips, and much, much more.
[01:50:29.086 --> 01:50:30.987]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[01:50:31.187 --> 01:50:35.070]  Order your copy on VHS or TV today, and man the guns in the info war.
[01:50:35.150 --> 01:50:36.731]  Order right now by calling 1-888-2533139.
[01:50:36.751 --> 01:50:37.492]  That's 888-2533139.
[01:50:43.636 --> 01:50:46.925]  Or order online at InfoWars.com or InfoWars.net.
[01:50:46.945 --> 01:50:48.229]  I'll give them that number, 888-2533139.
[01:50:52.734 --> 01:50:58.998]  The illuminated Berkey Base allows most gravity filters to be used in the center of a table by raising the spigot level.
[01:50:59.118 --> 01:51:05.301]  Made of durable Lexan polymer, the same material used for bulletproof glass, it has 8 LED lamps.
[01:51:05.562 --> 01:51:14.007]  Incredibly, the low-energy LEDs will last for more than 11 years of continuous use and are bright enough to be spotted for over a mile in the dark.
[01:51:14.247 --> 01:51:21.271]  The LED lamps are powered by an AC adapter and during emergencies, the rechargeable batteries will operate them all night long.
[01:51:21.571 --> 01:51:26.394]  When the LEDs are switched off, the AC adapter automatically recharges the batteries.
[01:51:26.614 --> 01:51:32.018]  The Berkey Base is available in gorgeous cobalt blue or practical bright white LEDs.
[01:51:32.358 --> 01:51:35.460]  Ideal as an emergency light, flashlight, or nightlight.
[01:51:35.781 --> 01:51:43.746]  Get the illuminated Berkey Base for only $69 or get both white and blue for only $125 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:51:43.786 --> 01:51:44.366]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[01:51:53.612 --> 01:51:54.292]  We're good to go.
[01:52:09.256 --> 01:52:09.856]  I think so.

[01:53:00.708 --> 01:53:02.709]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:53:03.649 --> 01:53:08.510]  That's right, your calls are coming up in the next hour, plus a ton of other vital news and information.
[01:53:10.671 --> 01:53:22.714]  But earlier, I mentioned the way we're winning hearts and minds over there, that is our military being used by the globalists, is if your papers aren't in exact order, you go to a camp, your family gets tortured.
[01:53:22.994 --> 01:53:24.174]  There's 32 of these camps.
[01:53:26.335 --> 01:53:27.535]  On top of all of this,
[01:53:29.655 --> 01:53:35.796]  If you were caught stealing firewood, they run over your taxi or your car with a tank and then machine gun it and laugh at you.
[01:53:38.237 --> 01:53:39.877]  There's a gang-like mentality.
[01:53:41.058 --> 01:53:42.478]  And a lot of the soldiers don't like this.
[01:53:42.538 --> 01:53:46.699]  Some of them love it because they're recruiting right out of the gang member ranks all over this nation.
[01:53:47.599 --> 01:53:49.740]  So let's go ahead and play this clip from PBS.
[01:53:50.780 --> 01:53:51.680]  This is from NOVA.
[01:53:52.805 --> 01:53:54.606]  And, uh, this is how they maintain order.
[01:53:54.626 --> 01:53:55.627]  This is how they do things.
[01:53:55.847 --> 01:54:01.431]  This is somebody that, they later admitted, was suspected of stealing three sticks of firewood.
[01:54:01.451 --> 01:54:02.012]  Uh, here it is.
[01:54:02.452 --> 01:54:04.794]  There was still some looting going on when we arrived.
[01:54:04.814 --> 01:54:11.839]  And when we came across soldiers, they didn't seem sure of their role.
[01:54:13.610 --> 01:54:14.890]  That child don't need to be in here.
[01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:17.611]  You know where school is?
[01:54:17.651 --> 01:54:20.351]  That's where he needs to be doing, not following you.
[01:54:20.631 --> 01:54:24.072]  We filmed these G.I.s after they caught a group of Iraqis stealing wood.
[01:54:24.792 --> 01:54:30.693]  We've got to stop them from looting, they don't understand, so we take their car and we'll crush them.
[01:54:30.713 --> 01:54:32.153]  United States Army, tankers, hold.
[01:54:32.173 --> 01:54:39.795]  I haven't seen you on the car for pleasure, first.
[01:54:39.995 --> 01:54:40.975]  The laughing's coming up.
[01:54:50.196 --> 01:54:51.757]  You want to cook food for your children?
[01:54:51.777 --> 01:54:56.098]  You cook some wood?
[01:54:56.258 --> 01:55:08.563]  It's like Barbarossa.
[01:55:11.744 --> 01:55:12.884]  That's what you get when you loot.
[01:55:14.265 --> 01:55:17.926]  Later, the car's owner told us, I'm a taxi driver.
[01:55:18.729 --> 01:55:20.210]  The car was my livelihood.
[01:55:21.751 --> 01:55:25.434]  So, we've gone from rose petals to RPGs being thrown at the Tribs.
[01:55:26.055 --> 01:55:29.597]  Oh, don't worry, they'll just kill more people and do that, and it'll be even worse.
[01:55:29.637 --> 01:55:30.278]  That's the plan.
[01:55:30.298 --> 01:55:31.019]  We're not meant to win.
[01:55:31.659 --> 01:55:33.500]  But it's the order of death, folks.
[01:55:33.520 --> 01:55:34.781]  The order of death is into this.
[01:55:34.841 --> 01:55:35.302]  It likes us.
[01:55:35.562 --> 01:55:38.704]  Known as skull and bone, here's Tom Brokaw telling you about your bosses.
[01:55:38.724 --> 01:55:39.225]  Go ahead and hit it.
[01:55:40.025 --> 01:55:45.750]  You know, Tim, what's so interesting to me about these two candidates, and I've talked about it a fair amount during the campaign, Tim, they are two sons of privilege.
[01:55:46.428 --> 01:55:49.910]  Who were raised by distinguished families in the Northeast.
[01:55:50.050 --> 01:55:53.311]  They went to two of the best prep schools in America, Andover and St.
[01:55:53.331 --> 01:55:53.652]  Paul's.
[01:55:54.072 --> 01:55:57.193]  They were at Yale at the same time, members of a secret society.
[01:55:57.554 --> 01:56:01.415]  They went in distinctly different directions after they left Yale University.
[01:56:01.796 --> 01:56:03.536]  And they come around now to meet each other.
[01:56:03.577 --> 01:56:05.217]  I was counting up their degrees the other day.
[01:56:05.277 --> 01:56:06.998]  This is an argument for a good education.
[01:56:07.018 --> 01:56:10.520]  Two degrees from Yale, one from Harvard, and one from Boston College.
[01:56:11.372 --> 01:56:11.792]  Not true!
[01:56:32.524 --> 01:56:38.687]  We still haven't found out whether, when they met on the stage at those debates, whether they gave each other the old secret Skull & Bones handshake.
[01:56:38.767 --> 01:56:41.188]  And that may be a secret forever, for all we know.
[01:56:41.248 --> 01:56:44.310]  Well, if you mention Skull & Bones in their presence, you're supposed to leave the room.
[01:56:45.630 --> 01:56:47.051]  But they both stayed at their podium then.
[01:56:47.091 --> 01:56:47.691]  They did indeed.
[01:56:48.792 --> 01:56:50.012]  Well, there you have it.
[01:56:50.093 --> 01:56:53.294]  Yeah, why didn't that get brought up by the debate questioners?
[01:56:53.354 --> 01:56:55.335]  Because it was all staged and pre-agreed upon.
[01:56:55.355 --> 01:56:57.096]  Pre-ordained.
[01:56:58.577 --> 01:57:00.477]  Third hour coming up, we're going to take a lot of your calls.
[01:57:00.497 --> 01:57:01.418]  I'm going to go back over.
[01:57:02.288 --> 01:57:07.072]  Uh, this, uh, Chuck Baldwin article, because we're not going to let Big Brother keep us from getting this information out.
[01:57:08.873 --> 01:57:13.416]  And, uh, we'll get into just so much other news, the plunging dollar, uh, the rest of it.
[01:57:13.436 --> 01:57:16.378]  A giant stack of Big Brother news I will blitz through.
[01:57:16.398 --> 01:57:25.124]  In fact, uh, we'll take a few calls when we get back and go through all this news, and, uh, you don't want to miss it, but again, don't forget PrisonPlanet.tv
[01:57:27.193 --> 01:57:44.045]  Don't miss anything, not the audio interviews, the text reports, my weekly TV reports, all my videos, Paul Watson's book, my book, 15 cents a day, PrisonPlanet.TV, we'll be right back!
[01:57:49.849 --> 01:57:53.972]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups,
[01:57:54.654 --> 01:57:55.475]  You want answers?
[01:57:56.235 --> 01:57:57.116]  Well, so does he.
[01:57:57.136 --> 01:58:01.720]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:58:01.980 --> 01:58:06.123]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:58:10.567 --> 01:58:16.512]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, already into hour number three of this global transmission against tyranny.
[01:58:18.368 --> 01:58:21.669]  I want to go back over and get your comments on this Chuck Baldwin article.
[01:58:21.769 --> 01:58:26.110]  Christians and conservatives can go back to sleep now because the boogeyman is gone.
[01:58:26.130 --> 01:58:29.710]  And he lifts how Bush is Bill Clinton on steroids.
[01:58:30.170 --> 01:58:32.191]  And we're not saying Kerry would save us either.
[01:58:32.231 --> 01:58:33.991]  The point is, there's no difference.
[01:58:35.311 --> 01:58:39.232]  And I'd like to hear callers add other things Bush is doing that isn't conservative.
[01:58:40.052 --> 01:58:45.734]  Really all you can say that Bush is doing that's different than Kerry is the gay marriage issue, even though Kerry says he's against that too.
[01:58:46.934 --> 01:58:47.894]  There's a slight difference.
[01:58:49.358 --> 01:58:52.501]  And really that's about it other than the taxes.
[01:58:54.823 --> 01:58:59.928]  Now make no mistake, the Federal Reserve wants us to go into deeper debt.
[01:59:00.849 --> 01:59:05.754]  And when Bush says that lowering taxes will create more money in the treasury, that's true.
[01:59:05.854 --> 01:59:12.201]  But when the tax cuts are so small, and by the way they are small to the general public, quite large for big corporations,
[01:59:13.093 --> 01:59:22.576]  When you crunch the math, the amount of money coming into the Treasury, that's all fiat to begin with, does not even begin to erode away that growing ballooning deficit.
[01:59:23.296 --> 01:59:26.197]  Now, we wouldn't have this big deficit if it was just increased military spending.
[01:59:26.257 --> 01:59:28.017]  People say, oh, well, it's the military, we're in a war.
[01:59:28.417 --> 01:59:32.178]  No, it's double Department of Education, ballooning Homeland Security.
[01:59:32.658 --> 01:59:38.700]  I mean, every federal agency just ballooning and ballooning and ballooning while actual benefits for the veterans and other things are slashed.
[01:59:39.582 --> 01:59:40.463]  So that's the reality.
[01:59:41.164 --> 01:59:44.288]  Meanwhile, folks, the dollar is plunging.
[01:59:45.370 --> 01:59:46.792]  And they say it could slide further.
[01:59:46.812 --> 01:59:55.343]  It says that currency traders were taken aback on Friday when the greenback fell in spite of bullish data.
[01:59:56.664 --> 01:59:59.926]  If this can't cause the dollar to strengthen, you have to tell me what will.
[02:00:00.026 --> 02:00:10.373]  This is a big green light to sell the dollar, said David Bloom, Currency Analyst at HSBC, as the greenback fell to a nine-year low in trade-weighted terms.
[02:00:10.593 --> 02:00:14.155]  The dollar's fall comes as Federal Reserve is widely expected to raise U.S.
[02:00:14.215 --> 02:00:21.680]  interest rates by a quarter point to two percent when it meets on Wednesday and will signal that it will continue with a measured pace of rate increases.
[02:00:22.649 --> 02:00:31.056]  Speculative traders, and they are traders to America and Chicago, last week racked up the highest number of long euro-short dollar contracts on record.
[02:00:31.937 --> 02:00:38.162]  Options traders have reported brisk business in euro calls, contracts to buy the euro at a predetermined rate.
[02:00:41.596 --> 02:00:47.838]  However, the market has been rife with rumors that the latest wave of selling has been led by foreign governments seeking to cut their exposures to U.S.
[02:00:47.918 --> 02:00:48.218]  interest.
[02:00:48.618 --> 02:00:50.538]  India and Russia have reportedly been selling U.S.
[02:00:50.658 --> 02:00:54.099]  assets, as well as petrodollar-rich Middle East investors.
[02:00:54.559 --> 02:01:10.263]  China, which has a $515 billion dollar reserves, which also set the selling dollar by buying Asian currencies in readiness to switch to the Grunabi's dollar peg to a basket arrangement, something Chinese officials have increasingly hinted at.
[02:01:11.375 --> 02:01:17.216]  Any reallocation by China could push the dollar sharply lower.
[02:01:17.596 --> 02:01:18.096]  Oh, man.
[02:01:22.557 --> 02:01:26.858]  Can you tell the average guy in a nice restaurant a three-piece suit about this?
[02:01:26.898 --> 02:01:27.978]  He goes, what's that mean?
[02:01:28.358 --> 02:01:29.059]  Weak dollar.
[02:01:29.119 --> 02:01:30.099]  Bush say good.
[02:01:30.759 --> 02:01:32.559]  Bush say open border good.
[02:01:33.479 --> 02:01:35.820]  Bush say UNESCO good.
[02:01:36.620 --> 02:01:38.380]  Bush say export of jobs good.
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:40.901]  Hamburger job industrial.
[02:01:42.125 --> 02:01:46.407]  We have more industrial jobs now that 6 million fast food workers added.
[02:01:47.728 --> 02:01:48.969]  It's all smoke and mirrors.
[02:01:49.309 --> 02:01:55.472]  As more people go off the unemployment rolls, they count those as people employed.
[02:01:55.532 --> 02:01:56.613]  I mean, that's admitted!
[02:01:56.673 --> 02:01:58.234]  It's all a fraud!
[02:02:00.695 --> 02:02:08.419]  And all these yuppies think if they just join with the system and believe in it, that they'll be okay, because they're part of the system, because they deny what's happening.
[02:02:08.739 --> 02:02:09.880]  Everything's going to be okay.
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:14.540]  Oh my goodness.
[02:02:14.880 --> 02:02:17.241]  We're going to blitz through your calls after this breaks.
[02:02:17.261 --> 02:02:17.661]  Be ready.
[02:02:17.681 --> 02:02:18.001]  1-800-259-9231.
[02:02:18.081 --> 02:02:22.762]  And then I'm going to blitz through more news.
[02:02:23.263 --> 02:02:24.383]  So much on the police state.
[02:02:24.403 --> 02:02:25.203]  A big stack here.
[02:02:25.883 --> 02:02:27.144]  You do not want to miss what's coming up.
[02:02:28.564 --> 02:02:29.604]  I'm not trying to be negative.
[02:02:29.664 --> 02:02:36.166]  I mean, it's like if your house is on fire and it's smoking and you can't breathe and you go, well, I'll just be positive and everything will be OK.
[02:02:36.386 --> 02:02:39.407]  And then I kick down your door and run in and grab you and go, get out of here!
[02:02:39.447 --> 02:02:40.347]  It's on fire!
[02:02:41.147 --> 02:02:42.868]  Don't be so negative, Alex.
[02:02:47.719 --> 02:02:53.221]  Why continue to suffer from pain, illness, and disease when natural health and wellness therapies are within your reach?
[02:02:53.621 --> 02:02:57.862]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife Frequency Technology.
[02:02:58.102 --> 02:03:05.144]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[02:03:05.504 --> 02:03:11.626]  The BioSolutions Frequency Instrument uses this same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[02:03:11.766 --> 02:03:12.966]  There are no side effects.
[02:03:13.306 --> 02:03:16.270]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:18.452]  Eliminate the cause, don't just treat symptoms.
[02:03:18.753 --> 02:03:25.981]  BioSolutions has over 450 pre-programmed auto-sequences for various health conditions and is very easy to use.
[02:03:26.302 --> 02:03:29.666]  It comes with a 30-day return policy and a one-year limited warranty.

[02:03:34.551 --> 02:03:34.751]  Call today.
[02:03:45.811 --> 02:03:48.815]  The Berkey Light is your premier source for purified water.
[02:03:49.156 --> 02:03:57.987]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[02:03:58.308 --> 02:04:02.994]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[02:04:03.454 --> 02:04:10.158]  The Berkelite is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[02:04:10.559 --> 02:04:22.346]  It also removes foul taste and odors like the rotten egg smell of sulfide and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[02:04:22.826 --> 02:04:27.287]  The Berkey Lights Rechargeable LED Lighting System is so bright it can be used as a reading light.

[02:04:42.071 --> 02:04:43.271]  Not yet available in Iowa.
[02:04:45.511 --> 02:04:48.392]  What really happened September 11th and who stands to gain?
[02:04:49.096 --> 02:04:50.397]  Alex Jones here, America.
[02:04:50.597 --> 02:04:56.339]  We answer these vital questions and much, much more in my newest and most explosive documentary yet, 9-1-1, The Road to Tyranny.
[02:04:56.599 --> 02:05:01.840]  In two hours and 24 minutes, we point a searing light of truth on the history of problem-reaction-solution.
[02:05:02.161 --> 02:05:06.262]  Brace yourselves as the new world order program for world domination is blown wide open.
[02:05:06.442 --> 02:05:10.247]  A nightmarish post-September 11th world, where the military and the police are merged.
[02:05:10.507 --> 02:05:15.153]  Witnesses' populations beg for national ID cards, and yes, even implantable microchips.
[02:05:15.253 --> 02:05:21.521]  Troops on the streets, foreign NATO aircraft in the skies, psychotic UN population control plans, and much, much more.
[02:05:21.561 --> 02:05:23.384]  This is one film you cannot afford to miss.
[02:05:23.784 --> 02:05:24.725]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[02:05:24.765 --> 02:05:25.645]  Alex Jones, on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:05:53.383 --> 02:05:55.545]  Alright, we're going to plunge straight into your calls.
[02:05:55.605 --> 02:05:59.588]  I'm going to move to you very quickly so you have your question or comment ready so we give the next person time.
[02:05:59.928 --> 02:06:01.009]  Again, thank you for calling.
[02:06:01.770 --> 02:06:03.451]  Uh, who's up first here in my order?
[02:06:05.233 --> 02:06:06.614]  Alright, Malta and Denmark.
[02:06:06.714 --> 02:06:07.555]  Go ahead, Malta.
[02:06:08.035 --> 02:06:08.836]  Hello, Alex.
[02:06:09.116 --> 02:06:13.079]  I just want to mention about this independent war you're talking about.
[02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:20.005]  You get a lot of help from German military genius, von Struppen.
[02:06:20.025 --> 02:06:21.046]  Do you remember him?
[02:06:22.126 --> 02:06:22.527]  Uh, yes.
[02:06:23.454 --> 02:06:29.515]  Yeah, and the Polish national hero, Konstantin Kuznicki.
[02:06:30.796 --> 02:06:31.036]  Yeah.
[02:06:32.016 --> 02:06:37.257]  And I see the state... You're talking about how the Germans shut up our modern military system.
[02:06:38.257 --> 02:06:38.957]  No, I don't know.
[02:06:39.077 --> 02:06:44.359]  It was a help from some military genius in the war against the British.
[02:06:44.419 --> 02:06:45.279]  No, that's what I just said.
[02:06:45.319 --> 02:06:46.939]  They sent him over here for that model.
[02:06:47.479 --> 02:06:51.220]  And then also, our modern educational system is admitted
[02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:54.262]  I see France and Spain was helping out, too, in 1778.
[02:07:20.512 --> 02:07:21.772]  Well, that's double-edged.
[02:07:22.833 --> 02:07:24.313]  There were lords in Germany.
[02:07:24.353 --> 02:07:26.134]  Germany was a bunch of different counties.
[02:07:26.154 --> 02:07:26.774]  Yeah, I know that.
[02:07:26.794 --> 02:07:28.015]  With a different royal family.
[02:07:28.035 --> 02:07:30.636]  I know you probably know all this just for listeners.
[02:07:30.956 --> 02:07:34.157]  With different royal families over every little sector.
[02:07:34.877 --> 02:07:36.318]  And they owned their citizens.
[02:07:36.338 --> 02:07:43.461]  And so the Hessians, you know, that's where you get the term, Hessian boot, the boot up to the knee, Nazis like.
[02:07:44.141 --> 02:07:48.703]  They were shipped over here to fight us, but then also von Steuben, that you mentioned, was also sent over to help.
[02:07:49.083 --> 02:07:49.823]  And the Braunschweig.
[02:07:50.916 --> 02:08:03.672]  Another thing before I go, about this dialogue going down, there was a book called Aeroquick, a British
[02:08:08.784 --> 02:08:13.189]  Yes sir, I appreciate the call.
[02:08:13.770 --> 02:08:16.493]  The IMF and the World Bank have been saying it for a decade.
[02:08:16.513 --> 02:08:22.219]  The 1954 First Bilderberg Group meeting minutes were released by them to brag two years ago.
[02:08:22.660 --> 02:08:23.861]  The BBC published them.
[02:08:23.901 --> 02:08:27.966]  We have them on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:08:28.717 --> 02:08:33.160]  They're in the New World Order sections of both sites, and they said that this was the plan all along.
[02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:44.447]  Then, after the dollar starts failing, we'll have the Amaro to, quote, counter that, and that'll cause problems, and they'll go, okay, the Phoenix will be the new global currency, merged with the Asian currency.
[02:08:45.548 --> 02:08:49.111]  And the African currency's now coming out, this is how they do it, all owned by the same people.
[02:08:50.171 --> 02:08:52.593]  And, uh, this has been the plan.
[02:08:54.176 --> 02:09:01.379]  And to show that Bush is a puppet of Europe and isn't fighting with them, he's out saying, good, drop the dollar, good, more, more!
[02:09:01.779 --> 02:09:06.641]  We were always proud of our dollar, but now you have to learn that no, having a good dollar is bad.
[02:09:08.261 --> 02:09:10.542]  Let's go ahead and talk to Tiffany in Oklahoma.
[02:09:10.562 --> 02:09:11.443]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:09:11.463 --> 02:09:14.364]  Hey Alex, I've got a question for you.
[02:09:14.704 --> 02:09:14.944]  Sure.
[02:09:15.384 --> 02:09:18.805]  When do you plan on coming to Oklahoma for like a seminar?
[02:09:18.845 --> 02:09:23.127]  Because there are so many people here in Oklahoma who are blind by what is going on.
[02:09:24.159 --> 02:09:26.841]  I don't do a lot of traveling unless it's to do a news story.
[02:09:26.881 --> 02:09:29.043]  Occasionally, I go and speak places.
[02:09:29.083 --> 02:09:31.264]  I apologize to all those who I've refused.
[02:09:31.985 --> 02:09:34.107]  And I'm very honored that people want to hear me come speak.
[02:09:34.707 --> 02:09:35.488]  Here's the facts.
[02:09:35.528 --> 02:09:43.654]  In the time it takes me to fly or drive to, say, Oklahoma, on average, I probably do 10 radio interviews, not to mention my own show.
[02:09:44.094 --> 02:09:47.877]  And let's say those are 10 small interviews, I probably reach 10 million people.
[02:09:48.718 --> 02:09:51.700]  10 big interviews, I might reach 50 million people.
[02:09:52.736 --> 02:10:02.080]  So I can reach that many via the radio, or I can come and have that personal interaction that people, both hosts and listeners, relish.
[02:10:02.901 --> 02:10:09.964]  And it's a nice primitive interface, but it's not really, oh, what's the term they use?
[02:10:10.464 --> 02:10:11.545]  Time productive?
[02:10:11.565 --> 02:10:12.585]  Yeah.
[02:10:16.178 --> 02:10:16.879]  Oh, what's the term?
[02:10:17.019 --> 02:10:24.163]  They talk about an engine that produces a lot of power for how much energy is put into it.
[02:10:24.543 --> 02:10:25.103]  I understand.
[02:10:25.343 --> 02:10:28.465]  Productive, but productive is not the word.
[02:10:30.627 --> 02:10:32.908]  I can't stand it when a word won't come into my head, but go ahead.
[02:10:34.129 --> 02:10:38.131]  What I'm trying to say, we don't even have you on the radio here.
[02:10:38.431 --> 02:10:41.113]  We have to get on the computer and listen to you on the computer.
[02:10:44.065 --> 02:10:47.688]  In fact, that's how we found you, is by a search engine.
[02:10:48.228 --> 02:11:10.203]  Well, that's why the globalists are panicking, though, because 38 to 45 percent of people watching mainstream TV have left completely to, quote, alternative media, and the majority of that is the so-called libertarian, Christian conservative, slash, you know, truth seeker movement, and so it's like the horse and buggy fading away.
[02:11:10.883 --> 02:11:35.192]  I mean, AM&F is still where it's at, but things are moving into the net, so what's to stop you from putting up 500 flyers at Kinko's, and I'm not asking you to do this, but if you want to, and handing them out to people, I'd say 100 of those 500, that's a pretty good conversion rate, will tune in, and I'd say 75% of those will wake up, so you'll change 70 people's lives for 500 pieces of paper.
[02:11:38.911 --> 02:11:40.992]  It'll probably cost you about 60 bucks.
[02:11:41.672 --> 02:11:59.060]  The thing is, people here in Oklahoma, you know, I hate to say it, but they're just really blind and if you try to tell them something, like I was telling a lady at church, you know, don't vote Bush because he's skull and bones, and she's like, don't talk about your fellow brother, you know, Christian brother like that.
[02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:01.701]  No, no, you're a devil worshipper because you don't like the devil, yeah.
[02:12:01.761 --> 02:12:02.061]  Right.
[02:12:02.739 --> 02:12:03.159]  Right.
[02:12:03.199 --> 02:12:07.663]  But Bush prays to Allah, Bush prays to Shinto shrines and to the demon of the shrine.
[02:12:08.323 --> 02:12:11.445]  Bush is a member of Bohemian Grove.
[02:12:11.565 --> 02:12:12.746]  You are of the devil.
[02:12:13.087 --> 02:12:20.052]  Yeah, and of course you know the owl and that he worships the owl, but no, he's a Republican, he's Christian, he professes Christianity.
[02:12:20.092 --> 02:12:31.460]  And now he's trying to give a federal judgeship to the guy that shot down Judge Roy Moore and he's energetically lobbying for the head of the Judiciary Committee who will block all abortion legislation.
[02:12:32.600 --> 02:12:33.321]  Thanks for the call.
[02:12:34.401 --> 02:12:35.782]  Listen, I totally hear you, Tiffany.
[02:12:37.002 --> 02:12:45.066]  I know it's frustrating, but believe me, if you tell them, hey, here's some alternative information, print up a little one-page flyer, check it out.
[02:12:45.106 --> 02:12:46.587]  I didn't say all of them will wake up.
[02:12:46.727 --> 02:12:48.728]  I said about 70 out of the 500.
[02:12:48.948 --> 02:12:52.710]  Because probably only 100 will actually go listen to it.
[02:12:54.210 --> 02:12:54.791]  But 70%.
[02:12:55.951 --> 02:12:58.032]  So, look, you cannot lose.
[02:12:58.952 --> 02:12:59.993]  All you've got to do is fight.
[02:13:01.576 --> 02:13:03.137]  Being in the fight is half the fight.
[02:13:03.597 --> 02:13:05.878]  Knowing the facts is the other half and having God on your side.
[02:13:06.338 --> 02:13:08.680]  You cannot lose America if you take action.
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:15.723]  That doesn't mean the globalists won't nuke the city or release smallpox, try to have an excuse to shut down the web and have martial law and mass arrest.
[02:13:16.083 --> 02:13:17.404]  How do they want to go that direction?
[02:13:17.464 --> 02:13:20.045]  I know their war gamers have already done it, but they know they're going to fail.
[02:13:20.706 --> 02:13:22.467]  If 1% of us physically fight back.
[02:13:23.107 --> 02:13:24.648]  I don't want it to go to that red level.
[02:13:26.068 --> 02:13:27.429]  But if it does, c'est la vie.
[02:13:28.189 --> 02:13:28.830]  So is life.
[02:13:29.270 --> 02:13:30.371]  Steve in Kansas City.
[02:13:30.411 --> 02:13:31.111]  Steve, go ahead.
[02:13:31.897 --> 02:13:33.138]  Yes, Dr. Jones.
[02:13:35.139 --> 02:13:35.639]  I have a question.
[02:13:35.659 --> 02:13:36.940]  That's my dad, that's not me.
[02:13:37.720 --> 02:13:40.262]  Okay, well you should get a doctor from someplace.
[02:13:41.702 --> 02:13:49.747]  The 22nd Amendment, which you talk about quite frequently about, you know, Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[02:13:49.767 --> 02:14:01.253]  The 22nd Amendment talks about, you know, the order of how the president will
[02:14:01.932 --> 02:14:04.113]  You know, choose vice president.
[02:14:04.333 --> 02:14:08.154]  But it also says in there, if you're reading the full thing, that he must be 35.
[02:14:09.715 --> 02:14:15.196]  That's in the Constitution, the second article of the Constitution.
[02:14:15.696 --> 02:14:16.857]  Yes.
[02:14:16.917 --> 02:14:22.699]  It doesn't have anything to do with the Bill of Rights.
[02:14:22.799 --> 02:14:25.480]  I've actually got, here, keep talking, let me just grab it.
[02:14:27.000 --> 02:14:28.641]  I mean, I have it in front of me also.
[02:14:28.661 --> 02:14:29.721]  No, no, I believe you.
[02:14:32.214 --> 02:14:34.195]  Okay, that's 25.
[02:14:36.015 --> 02:14:54.981]  The 22nd Amendment just deals with, you know, how Congress will appoint, you know, no person shall be elected in the office for more than two years, and holding office.
[02:14:55.041 --> 02:15:01.043]  But then the second article of the Constitution
[02:15:03.418 --> 02:15:09.103]  Yeah, so they have to be 35, they have to be born in America, and their vice president cannot be from the same state.
[02:15:09.883 --> 02:15:20.432]  Right, no person other than naturally born, and 35, and they have to be in the country, in the United States, for 14 years.
[02:15:22.194 --> 02:15:26.217]  So I was just wanting people to, when they call their representatives,
[02:15:29.046 --> 02:15:29.547]  No, you're right.
[02:15:29.587 --> 02:15:32.189]  Those two clauses connect together, but we need to be specific.
[02:15:32.990 --> 02:15:38.314]  But go ahead, and that's Article... Article 2 of the Constitution.
[02:15:38.975 --> 02:15:40.456]  That's right.
[02:15:40.616 --> 02:15:42.958]  But I know that article connects with the 22nd Amendment.
[02:15:43.399 --> 02:15:50.565]  Yeah, the 22nd Amendment, I mean, it connects with it, but then, I mean, as far as Arnold
[02:15:54.150 --> 02:16:08.479]  I've read the bill on air months ago, like six months ago, when Hatch introduced it and it's posted on the site and it says repealed second article and then 22nd amendment, so it's part of a larger package.
[02:16:08.859 --> 02:16:10.280]  So you have to do both of those to do that.
[02:16:10.300 --> 02:16:11.281]  And no, they've been on TV.
[02:16:11.321 --> 02:16:13.162]  They say it is so he can be president.
[02:16:14.043 --> 02:16:18.586]  Well, I mean, there's no doubt about that, but they're pushing for that.
[02:16:19.144 --> 02:16:42.306]  That I mean, when you call your Senators, Representatives, which I inquire, and I have done, and I will continue to do, and I will, this is my new, I mean, being that Peruca didn't get elected, which I did vote for, I mean, that's my new campaign now.
[02:16:42.867 --> 02:16:44.749]  Well good, because I'm starting a website,
[02:16:45.584 --> 02:16:49.785]  And I hope you'll join us in fighting Arnold, as he likes to say, join Arnold.
[02:16:49.805 --> 02:16:52.625]  But I mean, I don't even care if it's Arnold.
[02:16:52.705 --> 02:17:03.048]  I mean, you know, if you're not born here in the United States, I mean, even if you're... Well, WorldNetDaily had a poll, and 1.7% of conservatives want Arnold to be president.
[02:17:03.588 --> 02:17:05.268]  So, he's at the bottom of the list.
[02:17:05.828 --> 02:17:10.269]  And what is it, eight-tenths of Democrats, two-thirds of Republicans don't want him in major polls.
[02:17:10.749 --> 02:17:12.790]  But that doesn't mean the global elite won't give him to you.
[02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:14.590]  They are going to run him against Hillary.
[02:17:15.476 --> 02:17:16.017]  You watch.
[02:17:16.777 --> 02:17:29.245]  But how do people, when 80% of the people want the borders blocked, how do the Congressmen, the House and Senate... It's simple.
[02:17:29.285 --> 02:17:37.830]  They put people like Orrin Hatch and Specter over the key committees to block the good Senators and to block the good House members.
[02:17:38.670 --> 02:17:40.532]  Which is what Bush is doing right now.
[02:17:40.852 --> 02:17:41.692]  Hey, thanks for the call.
[02:17:41.732 --> 02:17:42.153]  Great points.
[02:17:42.173 --> 02:17:42.653]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:45.908 --> 02:17:49.169]  Ever walk into someone's house and you can tell instantly they own pets?
[02:17:49.509 --> 02:17:54.171]  They've made the mistake of using a pet odor and stain product that only covers the problem temporarily.
[02:17:54.371 --> 02:17:55.892]  We don't have that problem in our home.
[02:17:56.092 --> 02:17:58.492]  We've discovered it's just better to use PAWS.

[02:19:44.637 --> 02:19:48.198]  Every hour of every day, someone out there is suffering from hemorrhoids.
[02:19:48.518 --> 02:19:51.019]  The pain, worry, and embarrassment can be devastating.

[02:20:03.121 --> 02:20:05.822]  After the doctor recommended surgery, we didn't know what to do.
[02:20:06.162 --> 02:20:09.903]  I ordered HEMTAB online, and soon after taking HEMTAB, the pain was gone.
[02:20:10.163 --> 02:20:12.104]  A few days later, the hemorrhoid began to shrink.
[02:20:12.384 --> 02:20:12.825]  Miracle?

[02:20:35.538 --> 02:20:35.678]  Hemtab.
[02:20:35.698 --> 02:20:37.021]  The effective alternative.
[02:20:44.545 --> 02:20:48.446]  The United States seems to be celebrating over its triumph of reducing government debt.
[02:20:48.666 --> 02:21:00.950]  But the truth be told, public and private debt increased to a record high in 1999, reaching a peak of $14.8 trillion, marking 10.57% annual increase, outpacing its previous 10 years.
[02:21:01.370 --> 02:21:01.770]  The U.S.
[02:21:01.810 --> 02:21:07.392]  economy receives its currency by taking on debt through a private banking institution called the Federal Reserve System.
[02:21:07.792 --> 02:21:10.013]  In the year 2000, debt growth collapsed to only 4.5%.
[02:21:11.873 --> 02:21:12.934]  It's bad enough that the U.S.
[02:21:12.974 --> 02:21:15.815]  citizens is bound by debt in order to have commerce.
[02:21:15.915 --> 02:21:21.958]  However, shocking the economy with the reduction of this magnitude could wipe out years of growth in a stock portfolio.
[02:21:22.378 --> 02:21:25.740]  Before you make your next investment decision, get the cold hard facts.
[02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:32.163]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for your free report on the outstanding level of public and private debt.
[02:21:32.723 --> 02:21:36.605]  You must understand how recession and depression are driven by outstanding debt.
[02:21:36.625 --> 02:21:36.825]  Call 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:36.845 --> 02:21:37.065]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[02:21:37.085 --> 02:21:37.346]  All right.
[02:21:37.386 --> 02:21:37.966]  Kyle in California.
[02:21:38.006 --> 02:21:38.406]  Go ahead.
[02:21:38.446 --> 02:21:38.586]  Welcome.
[02:21:38.606 --> 02:21:39.407]  Good to talk to you, Kyle.
[02:21:39.827 --> 02:21:40.207]  Hello, Alex.
[02:21:40.227 --> 02:21:40.767]  I just wanted to say
[02:22:00.609 --> 02:22:01.950]  I heard you on Coast to Coast the other night.
[02:22:01.970 --> 02:22:03.431]  I thought you did a great job.
[02:22:03.751 --> 02:22:11.056]  I recently got a subscription to Prison Planet and I'm still shocked by some of the stuff I've seen on there.
[02:22:11.096 --> 02:22:24.266]  But I wanted to thank you for your observation about the fact that a lot of our soldiers are going to be future police and it's particularly frightening when they just dropped martial law in Iraq recently.
[02:22:25.146 --> 02:22:30.170]  And I also hear that they're going to have 4,000 troops at the inauguration.
[02:22:30.797 --> 02:22:31.897]  In Washington, D.C.
[02:22:33.578 --> 02:22:46.360]  And again, it's not that the troops are bad and the military is bad itself, it's that anytime a leader starts always surrounding himself by troops, showing that that's the symbol of the power, that's called fascism or communism or command and control.
[02:22:46.440 --> 02:22:47.120]  It's not freedom.
[02:22:47.420 --> 02:22:48.081]  Absolutely.
[02:22:48.181 --> 02:22:55.962]  And they've gotten hundreds of thousands of people to leave Fallujah, and generals have been on TV going, we're just detaining all of them and putting them in huge camps.
[02:22:56.842 --> 02:22:59.843]  I mean, this is martial law, and our troops, admittedly,
[02:23:00.715 --> 02:23:07.101]  A decade ago, we're training in Louisiana and other areas with foreign troops to do this domestically.
[02:23:07.502 --> 02:23:09.384]  Now we're going to come back with great training.
[02:23:09.444 --> 02:23:13.608]  I've done it in Serbia, Macedonia, just more and more of our military.
[02:23:13.788 --> 02:23:19.293]  And now, what, about 80% of the people that become police officers are folks that got out of the military.
[02:23:19.333 --> 02:23:24.178]  It's one of the only areas of the economy that's actually growing is prisons and law enforcement.
[02:23:24.893 --> 02:23:28.335]  And so they add tens of thousands more than that every year of police.
[02:23:28.475 --> 02:23:39.399]  Most of those are military and most of those are people who were busy out, you know, torturing and killing and running over people's cars because they were suspected of stealing firewood.
[02:23:40.940 --> 02:23:48.583]  I'm a son of a Vietnam veteran and my brother's best friend's body was desecrated in Fallujah months ago.
[02:23:49.184 --> 02:23:51.485]  So I'm not a partisan.
[02:23:51.505 --> 02:23:54.146]  I am a pro-survival of our soldiers.
[02:23:55.378 --> 02:23:56.959]  And that's what you get labeled a lot.
[02:23:57.500 --> 02:24:03.963]  Well, let me tell you, putting hundreds of thousands of people in camps and bombarding cities is not going to make us friends.
[02:24:03.983 --> 02:24:04.604]  Thanks for the call.
[02:24:05.504 --> 02:24:07.365]  I appreciated the fine points that you made there.
[02:24:09.006 --> 02:24:10.887]  Daniel and others, your calls are coming up.
[02:24:11.427 --> 02:24:13.949]  I need to go ahead and start getting into some more of the news here.
[02:24:15.655 --> 02:24:17.076]  Oh, there's so much.
[02:24:17.196 --> 02:24:21.119]  Georgia man commits suicide at Ground Zero, Washington Post.
[02:24:21.579 --> 02:24:29.385]  The Georgia man who killed himself at Ground Zero was upset about President Bush's re-election, but his biggest problem may have been his double life, sources say.
[02:24:31.106 --> 02:24:36.770]  And why would this guy be so upset that Bush won that he'd go commit suicide?
[02:24:37.031 --> 02:24:40.193]  I mean, I can't think of throwing your life away for a stupider reason.
[02:24:41.361 --> 02:24:45.763]  Oh, the New York Mafia got into control instead of the New Jersey Mafia.
[02:24:46.343 --> 02:24:47.403]  It's still the Mafia.
[02:24:47.423 --> 02:24:48.504]  You know, there's the analogy.
[02:24:50.725 --> 02:24:51.925]  There's no difference.
[02:24:52.145 --> 02:24:53.606]  Kerry was for the war.
[02:24:54.726 --> 02:24:56.187]  Kerry was for open borders.
[02:24:56.307 --> 02:24:57.647]  Kerry's for everything!
[02:24:59.748 --> 02:25:00.748]  Just incredible.
[02:25:00.808 --> 02:25:08.151]  But it may have been because, um... It may have been that his girlfriend broke up with him or something.
[02:25:08.191 --> 02:25:08.791]  Maybe that's why.
[02:25:08.891 --> 02:25:10.292]  But he's saying he committed suicide.
[02:25:11.883 --> 02:25:14.264]  Because of Kerry not winning.
[02:25:16.165 --> 02:25:21.748]  I mean, that's... Remember the Buddhist monks in Vietnam burning themselves up?
[02:25:26.330 --> 02:25:32.533]  I mean, I'm saying, you know, that was stupid, too, to make a point, but it takes a lot of courage at one level
[02:25:33.826 --> 02:25:37.431]  But you gotta really hate life to do that, so in a way it's kind of a cop-out.
[02:25:37.471 --> 02:25:42.297]  It's kind of a dual yin-yang type deal where it's cowardly to haunt you out as well.
[02:25:42.457 --> 02:25:43.738]  I would never commit suicide.
[02:25:43.858 --> 02:25:49.746]  Never, ever, on the record, if they ever kill me and put a suicide note there, it's a fake.
[02:25:50.607 --> 02:25:51.087]  In advance.
[02:25:51.828 --> 02:25:52.429]  I'm just joking.
[02:25:53.092 --> 02:25:54.494]  I'm not joking about I never committed suicide.
[02:25:55.254 --> 02:26:01.901]  But I can think of nothing more out of control to commit suicide about than because Kerry didn't win.
[02:26:01.921 --> 02:26:03.383]  Meanwhile, documents.
[02:26:03.503 --> 02:26:03.763]  U.S.
[02:26:03.803 --> 02:26:06.306]  had plans to nuke North Korea, UPI.
[02:26:07.026 --> 02:26:13.913]  Newly declassified documents revealed by the United States planned as recently as 1998 to drop nuclear bombs on North Korea.
[02:26:13.953 --> 02:26:15.395]  The country attacked South Korea.
[02:26:17.899 --> 02:26:31.651]  As part of scenario 5027, 24F15E, bombers flew simulation missions at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in North Carolina to drop nuclear bombs on a firing range between January and June of 98.
[02:26:33.333 --> 02:26:42.761]  Well, yeah, a year ago, Rumsfeld came out with a three-part plan how to attack North Korea, trying to get the lunatic, who we've helped arm, Rumsfeld helped give him the reactors back in 98,
[02:26:44.404 --> 02:26:46.205]  So problem, reaction, solution.
[02:26:46.265 --> 02:26:47.987]  I'm no fan of Kim Jong-il.
[02:26:49.608 --> 02:26:56.012]  And I'm no fan of Bill Clinton allowing the transfer of the Republican company of the reactors.
[02:26:56.993 --> 02:27:00.015]  That's why the Republicans would never go after Bush on any real issue.
[02:27:00.035 --> 02:27:02.156]  It had to be Monica because that was case specific.
[02:27:02.736 --> 02:27:12.323]  If it was Chinagate or North Koreagate or Pardongate or cocaine dealing gate or any of it, it's connected to Republicans running it and Clinton letting it happen.
[02:27:15.695 --> 02:27:17.637]  I got a bunch of big brother news here.
[02:27:18.338 --> 02:27:20.239]  A bunch of news on the staged election.
[02:27:21.120 --> 02:27:24.083]  Your calls, we're going to move really fast when we get back.
[02:27:26.305 --> 02:27:27.606]  Everybody, stay with us.
[02:27:28.046 --> 02:27:33.231]  I'm going to regroup and try to dig through this hundred articles I've got and pick 20, 25 of them I want to hit.
[02:27:34.232 --> 02:27:34.712]  Stay with us.
[02:27:34.732 --> 02:27:35.232]  We'll be right back.
[02:27:35.833 --> 02:27:36.754]  We're on the march.
[02:27:37.234 --> 02:27:38.836]  The empire's on the run.
[02:27:39.756 --> 02:27:42.419]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:27:45.578 --> 02:27:48.739]  I tried glucosamine for my arthritis, but it didn't help much.
[02:27:48.959 --> 02:27:51.380]  They tell me I just have to put up with my joint pain and stiffness.
[02:27:51.640 --> 02:27:56.802]  Are you doomed to a life of stiff and painful joints or dealing with expensive medications or painful injections?
[02:27:56.982 --> 02:27:57.683]  Well, no more.
[02:27:57.843 --> 02:28:00.804]  I'm pleased to tell you about a totally new product called Injuve.
[02:28:01.104 --> 02:28:04.305]  Rather than stopping the pain, Injuve attacks the causes of joint pain.
[02:28:04.565 --> 02:28:10.070]  Injuve replenishes what your body was born with by replacing a vital fluid your body loses as you grow older.
[02:28:10.290 --> 02:28:12.852]  It's called Hyaluronic Acid or HA.
[02:28:13.132 --> 02:28:20.899]  It's important to note that Injuve does not cure arthritis, but it helps reverse the aging process of our joints and reduces the pain and stiffness caused by lack of mobility.
[02:28:21.119 --> 02:28:24.322]  Injuve is one of the best lubricants and shock absorbers found in nature.
[02:28:24.542 --> 02:28:28.785]  In short, if you have joint pain or arthritis, you owe it to yourself to try Injuve.
[02:28:29.065 --> 02:28:32.048]  Injuve is all natural and comes in easy to swallow soft gels.
[02:28:32.248 --> 02:28:37.531]  Call 1-800-707-3953 and get one bottle free when you buy two.
[02:28:37.751 --> 02:28:44.074]  Remember, call 1-800-707-3953 and get your free bottle of Injuve when you buy two.
[02:28:44.294 --> 02:28:44.914]  Call today.
[02:28:45.294 --> 02:28:52.758]  Get the new Berkey battery adapter, an inexpensive yet long-term backup power supply for your Berkey Light LED system.
[02:28:53.078 --> 02:29:06.069]  The Berkey's LED lamps are unique because, incredibly, they have an average life of over 11 years of continuous use and are so bright they can be spotted for more than a mile in the dark, yet require very little energy.
[02:29:06.349 --> 02:29:09.632]  That's why this revolutionary new technology is a bit expensive.
[02:29:09.992 --> 02:29:20.463]  But it's worth every penny because the low-energy LEDs are able to provide light all night long for over two weeks on a single set of four AA alkaline batteries.
[02:29:20.744 --> 02:29:21.244]  That's right!
[02:29:21.424 --> 02:29:28.532]  Incredibly, your emergency light will operate every night for over two weeks for the price of four small AA batteries.
[02:29:28.832 --> 02:29:32.955]  Be prepared for unexpected emergencies and get the Berkey Battery Adapter.
[02:29:33.115 --> 02:29:37.579]  Complete with on-off switch for only $10 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:29:37.619 --> 02:29:38.079]  That's toll free, 888-803-4438.
[02:29:45.445 --> 02:29:47.926]  Hey folks, Michael Trudeau here, and I've got a gripe.
[02:29:48.306 --> 02:29:51.227]  Recently, construction in my area has doubled my commute time.
[02:29:51.387 --> 02:29:55.028]  I'm spending up to four hours in stop-and-go rush hour traffic every day.
[02:29:55.208 --> 02:29:57.649]  The worst part is, there's no good talk radio to listen to.
[02:29:57.809 --> 02:30:01.070]  But that doesn't matter to me anymore, thanks to the good people at Freeway Radio.
[02:30:01.250 --> 02:30:08.592]  I've got the Sony shortwave car stereo from Freeway Radio, and now I look forward to getting comfortable in my car and hearing the real scoop on the day's news.
[02:30:08.832 --> 02:30:10.513]  It's not just a shortwave radio, though.
[02:30:10.594 --> 02:30:14.417]  You can also get AM and FM, listen to cassettes, and control your CD changer.
[02:30:14.517 --> 02:30:16.418]  Call Freeway Radio today, toll-free, 866-404-3600.
[02:30:16.438 --> 02:30:17.179]  That's 1-866-404-3600.
[02:30:17.219 --> 02:30:19.801]  Get your own Sony shortwave car stereo today for only $189.
[02:30:19.921 --> 02:30:21.563]  Install it in the boat, the RV, or your car.
[02:30:28.188 --> 02:30:32.633]  The good news for us is that you'll have GCN programming and crystal clear radio wherever you go.
[02:30:32.754 --> 02:30:37.840]  Don't get me wrong, I'd still rather be golfing than sitting in traffic, but freeway radio has eased my commute immensely.
[02:30:37.920 --> 02:30:40.423]  Call them today at 1-866-404-3600 and let them do the same for you.
[02:30:51.129 --> 02:30:53.811]  Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 Central.
[02:30:54.171 --> 02:31:00.535]  Back from 9 to Midnight, I'm Alex Jones, your host, as we wage war on corruption and crash the lies of disinformation.
[02:31:01.395 --> 02:31:07.299]  Daniel and Phillip and Charles and Barbara, that's going to be it for calls.
[02:31:07.339 --> 02:31:08.700]  We'll have time to get to your calls.
[02:31:09.500 --> 02:31:14.904]  Coming up here in just a few minutes, license plate cameras to trap criminals.
[02:31:15.024 --> 02:31:17.105]  Going in all over the U.S.
[02:31:17.285 --> 02:31:19.967]  and in foreign countries, but also it'll track what you do.
[02:31:20.706 --> 02:31:25.068]  And these things don't just record your license plates, they digitally, instantly recognize them.
[02:31:25.108 --> 02:31:26.748]  I told you about this about eight years ago.
[02:31:27.148 --> 02:31:28.309]  Now it's going in everywhere.
[02:31:29.689 --> 02:31:32.670]  Plane passengers, shocked by their x-ray scans.
[02:31:32.710 --> 02:31:35.812]  That's the one you saw two and a half years ago where you're totally naked.
[02:31:36.492 --> 02:31:38.252]  Down to even the pores on your skin.
[02:31:38.292 --> 02:31:39.973]  It's more human than human.
[02:31:39.993 --> 02:31:43.294]  That is, it gives a more detailed image than even the naked eye.
[02:31:44.455 --> 02:31:45.255]  If that's possible.
[02:31:46.249 --> 02:32:14.032]  And, uh, School Day Pack features satellite tracking, Google censoring information, uh, Under the Hood with Big Brother, now OnStar, it's going to track you even more, the more scary system, CIA Rollinside, USA Greater, and that's about a half inch of the two inches of police state stuff I just want to blitz through here after some calls, but first off, I called him in here,
[02:32:15.202 --> 02:32:16.903]  He never even asked to come on the show anymore.
[02:32:16.943 --> 02:32:22.427]  He's Ted Anderson, owns Midas Resources, that has supported and built the Genesis Network.
[02:32:23.008 --> 02:32:25.270]  The biggest sponsor, frankly, of this network, period.
[02:32:25.910 --> 02:32:26.871]  Two separate companies.
[02:32:28.412 --> 02:32:34.236]  And gold, let me see, gold I bought three years ago has doubled, almost doubled.
[02:32:34.777 --> 02:32:39.040]  Gold I bought two years ago is up by, I don't know, what, 35%?
[02:32:39.080 --> 02:32:39.700]  No, more than 35%.
[02:32:43.659 --> 02:32:46.462]  And gold is now at $433.21.
[02:32:48.544 --> 02:32:48.964]  Right now.
[02:32:51.086 --> 02:32:57.292]  This is a way to cash in some dollars before, and I hope this doesn't happen, but it looks like it probably will, unfortunately.
[02:32:57.312 --> 02:32:59.574]  It's what the IMF and World Bank are saying.
[02:32:59.594 --> 02:33:01.416]  I've got Reuters and AP here in front of me.
[02:33:01.756 --> 02:33:02.957]  Before it even goes down more.
[02:33:03.738 --> 02:33:07.622]  Now, regardless, you'll still have something that's real and has value.
[02:33:08.912 --> 02:33:11.074]  And I believe in this network.
[02:33:11.114 --> 02:33:12.055]  I believe in gold.
[02:33:13.056 --> 02:33:15.098]  I believe that you need to buy some.
[02:33:15.738 --> 02:33:18.341]  And they've got gold at last week's prices.
[02:33:18.801 --> 02:33:19.642]  Now it's going up!
[02:33:20.663 --> 02:33:21.924]  At last week's prices.
[02:33:22.865 --> 02:33:26.108]  A lot less than it is now, next time they make a purchase.
[02:33:27.795 --> 02:33:30.317]  And you need to take advantage of this.
[02:33:30.717 --> 02:33:35.301]  Ted Anderson, tell folks about the $5 gold piece special.
[02:33:35.662 --> 02:33:36.783]  Well, here's the thing, Alex.
[02:33:36.823 --> 02:33:44.509]  The reason why a person wants to get the $5 gold piece to start with is because small gold can be carried and it's portable and it can be traded for groceries.
[02:33:45.150 --> 02:33:47.232]  Obviously, it's good to have something like that.
[02:33:47.272 --> 02:33:49.734]  I've got the $5 gold pieces currently right now.
[02:33:51.446 --> 02:34:15.240]  at $168 a coin and like you say gold is going up we do have gold at $433.20 that's very significant once we broke through that $430 range really the next level of resistance is in between $440 and $450 and normally smaller increments cost more than other increments because they are so valuable that's a great price on that
[02:34:16.341 --> 02:34:17.182]  That quarter ounce.
[02:34:17.562 --> 02:34:18.062]  Yeah, it is.
[02:34:18.162 --> 02:34:20.704]  It's really a good buy to get into them at this particular time.
[02:34:20.744 --> 02:34:26.387]  As a matter of fact, the coins are trading at about $700 apiece in the mid-1980s when gold was more popular.
[02:34:26.887 --> 02:34:29.188]  Obviously, gold is getting more popular now.
[02:34:30.189 --> 02:34:34.832]  This particular coin is going to be, you know, watching the gold prices, it's going to be higher.
[02:34:34.932 --> 02:34:38.554]  There's no way to, you know, without gold, you know, gold's going up.
[02:34:38.594 --> 02:34:40.775]  The $5 gold pieces are going to go along with it.
[02:34:41.195 --> 02:34:42.757]  And you take a look at the news right now.
[02:34:42.837 --> 02:34:44.079]  Foreigners are dumping U.S.
[02:34:44.119 --> 02:34:45.640]  dollars like they just don't want them.
[02:34:45.981 --> 02:34:47.623]  They can't get rid of them fast enough.
[02:34:48.063 --> 02:34:48.324]  U.S.
[02:34:48.384 --> 02:34:50.907]  Treasuries aren't selling in the foreign markets like they used to.
[02:34:51.407 --> 02:34:56.213]  And the United States economy relied on foreigners to finance our economy all through the 1980s and 1990s.
[02:34:58.115 --> 02:34:59.716]  And we would live off of that credit.
[02:34:59.736 --> 02:35:01.716]  Yeah, and Bush and Kerry both would have done this.
[02:35:01.816 --> 02:35:13.160]  I mean, this is the public open sellout of America, because if we were going to have a fiat currency and a fiat economy based on fraud, we might as well still be the world reserve, because at least we, quote, still had fiat money.
[02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:15.341]  Now they're taking that away from us, folks.
[02:35:15.821 --> 02:35:18.802]  And before this continues to slide any further, I personally
[02:35:19.682 --> 02:35:22.183]  I procrastinated a few weeks ago and didn't get gold.
[02:35:22.363 --> 02:35:23.024]  I meant to.
[02:35:23.564 --> 02:35:29.807]  I am, yes, today, calling Ted, myself, and Ted, I am getting some.
[02:35:30.227 --> 02:35:31.007]  I procrastinated.
[02:35:31.027 --> 02:35:31.908]  I didn't do it.
[02:35:32.028 --> 02:35:34.329]  I want some of these before the price even goes up.
[02:35:35.309 --> 02:35:37.311]  Even further, give them a call right now.
[02:35:37.771 --> 02:35:41.773]  It's the, I guess called Alex Jones Special, so when they call the brokers know what you're talking about.
[02:35:41.793 --> 02:35:42.374]  888-294-6187.
[02:35:42.394 --> 02:35:42.574]  888-294-6187.
[02:35:42.594 --> 02:35:42.754]  888-294-6187.
[02:35:42.774 --> 02:35:46.537]  And Ted, when I get off in 21 minutes, can I call your extension?
[02:35:46.657 --> 02:35:48.498]  Will you do a gold deal for me?
[02:35:48.978 --> 02:35:50.379]  Yeah, I'd be happy to.
[02:35:50.459 --> 02:35:51.340]  I'm serious.
[02:35:51.360 --> 02:35:53.001]  I'm going to call you at your extension.
[02:36:02.527 --> 02:36:08.053]  You're, because I want you specifically, Ted, and what's your extension for folks?
[02:36:08.073 --> 02:36:09.194]  Well, I guess I'll just call the number.
[02:36:09.214 --> 02:36:11.597]  Yeah, just call the number, and that's fine too.
[02:36:12.077 --> 02:36:15.380]  But once again, Alex, it's really a good time to be picking things up.
[02:36:15.420 --> 02:36:17.182]  Just do a little research yourself, folks.
[02:36:17.202 --> 02:36:19.324]  You'll see right now that foreigners are dumping U.S.
[02:36:19.364 --> 02:36:20.045]  government debt.
[02:36:20.426 --> 02:36:21.827]  They're getting out of the U.S.
[02:36:21.867 --> 02:36:22.328]  dollar.
[02:36:22.388 --> 02:36:24.690]  The dollar's falling against... I'm almost crying, Ted!
[02:36:24.770 --> 02:36:25.611]  This is horrible!
[02:36:26.712 --> 02:36:33.500]  It is horrible because the United States needs to have finances in order to maintain this credit binge that we've been on for so many years.
[02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:38.947]  And by the way folks, the little bit of gold I've got, I could dump that right now and roughly double my money, but I'm not going to do it!
[02:36:39.631 --> 02:36:45.253]  Yeah, Alex, you know, very few people take advantage of gold when it's at its lowest point.
[02:36:45.333 --> 02:36:46.634]  You were smart enough to do that.
[02:36:47.014 --> 02:36:49.375]  I still think gold is quite a bargain at this price.
[02:36:49.815 --> 02:36:54.497]  You know, you take like that future of the International Forecaster.
[02:36:54.797 --> 02:37:02.080]  I mean, they're calling for $480 gold by January, and they're also looking at potentially $800 gold before too long.
[02:37:02.440 --> 02:37:06.521]  So, you know, you could see it double again if we reach those numbers, and gold's been there before.
[02:37:06.681 --> 02:37:07.982]  Gold is vastly
[02:37:09.283 --> 02:37:19.112]  Underrated in its value, and my friends, would you rather have some money in the bank that could be devalued every day, or that could be seized or grabbed?
[02:37:19.492 --> 02:37:23.076]  Having it in your hand is quite a good feeling.
[02:37:23.096 --> 02:37:27.800]  That's a little bit of wealth I've got to have a large portion of my savings.
[02:37:27.900 --> 02:37:31.964]  I'd say, I don't know, 25-30% of what I have in savings is in gold.
[02:37:32.584 --> 02:37:43.671]  And I guess the rest is hanging around my wife's neck, but it's just important to have this, folks.
[02:37:43.691 --> 02:37:43.891]  888-294-6187.
[02:37:44.011 --> 02:37:45.432]  Ted, thanks for coming on.
[02:37:45.472 --> 02:37:46.732]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[02:37:47.013 --> 02:37:47.593]  You bet, folks.
[02:37:47.633 --> 02:37:48.313]  Take advantage of it.
[02:37:48.333 --> 02:37:48.373]  888-294-6187.
[02:37:51.958 --> 02:37:53.879]  I'm very angry right now.
[02:37:54.699 --> 02:37:57.280]  Gerhard Schroeder comes out and says, ah, the dollar's nothing.
[02:37:57.320 --> 02:37:59.261]  And Bush goes, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
[02:37:59.581 --> 02:38:00.181]  This is good.
[02:38:00.221 --> 02:38:01.222]  I mean, our own government.
[02:38:01.822 --> 02:38:06.004]  Alan Greenspan, if he stood up for the dollar right now, all the analysts say it would explode.
[02:38:06.504 --> 02:38:07.084]  He's not!
[02:38:07.124 --> 02:38:08.365]  He's out bad-mouthing it!
[02:38:12.086 --> 02:38:14.987]  Just asked my webmaster, Paul Watson, what he thinks of the dropping dollar.
[02:38:15.267 --> 02:38:16.528]  He couldn't explain it to you.
[02:38:17.128 --> 02:38:19.709]  But watch what he's paid me cut by 30-something percent.
[02:38:21.940 --> 02:38:27.902]  Again, the dollars dropped by 40% since I've been paying them, it's dropped by 30%.
[02:38:28.902 --> 02:38:30.643]  You know, it's just amazing, folks.
[02:38:32.123 --> 02:38:39.646]  But again, a poor Mexican in Yucatan growing corn knows about having a bad currency.
[02:38:40.246 --> 02:38:42.087]  But a yuppie doesn't know anything about it.
[02:38:42.387 --> 02:38:46.088]  But they know all about the TV show, Friends.
[02:38:47.961 --> 02:38:58.987]  Alright, let's go to calls, and I mean just ultra-rapid fire here, because I want to be able to get to everybody's calls and cover this news.
[02:39:00.007 --> 02:39:01.368]  Daniel in Texas, go ahead.
[02:39:01.768 --> 02:39:02.509]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:39:02.549 --> 02:39:03.749]  You continue to be my hero.
[02:39:03.789 --> 02:39:04.990]  You're my salvation every day.
[02:39:05.130 --> 02:39:06.191]  I'm not.
[02:39:06.691 --> 02:39:08.652]  I'm just an average guy.
[02:39:09.232 --> 02:39:09.913]  I know, I know.
[02:39:09.953 --> 02:39:11.013]  You've got to be modest.
[02:39:11.814 --> 02:39:12.234]  I am.
[02:39:12.674 --> 02:39:14.015]  I can't even hardly listen to myself.
[02:39:15.689 --> 02:39:26.198]  You haven't mentioned that General Eberhardt, our friend at Northern Command, just was replaced by Admiral Timothy Keating, a Navy man, who's now taking over the reins at Northern Command.
[02:39:26.838 --> 02:39:32.343]  And as part of his new agenda, he's saying he's planning to establish, quote, a maritime NORAD.
[02:39:32.859 --> 02:39:36.544]  And he says that this merit... May I read you a quote from the article?
[02:39:36.804 --> 02:39:41.290]  Well, please email it to tipsandinfowars.com or to Paul Watson over at Prison Planet.
[02:39:41.311 --> 02:39:42.632]  But how long did I say?
[02:39:42.712 --> 02:39:48.901]  It's the Maritime Administration Integrated with Homeland Security for the Infrastructure Protection Act.
[02:39:49.381 --> 02:39:51.182]  Merge with total military control.
[02:39:51.242 --> 02:39:52.622]  I saw these documents years ago.
[02:39:53.023 --> 02:40:08.089]  Maritime Administration is Admiralty, and Eberhardt, and now this new guy, I've seen the new quote, is openly saying they're going to be running our lives with the CIA and FBI commanding them in every town, and all crime is under their jurisdiction.
[02:40:08.609 --> 02:40:10.970]  The end of posse commentatus, go ahead, read it to us.
[02:40:11.731 --> 02:40:12.471]  What's this out of?
[02:40:13.509 --> 02:40:15.050]  Uh, this is from DefenseLink.mil.
[02:40:15.090 --> 02:40:17.432]  I mean, this is their own, this is their own propaganda.
[02:40:17.472 --> 02:40:20.494]  Email it, uh, GoToPrisonPlanet.com, contact Webmaster.
[02:40:20.574 --> 02:40:21.335]  Email it to Paul.
[02:40:21.755 --> 02:40:22.936]  Okay, uh, do you want the quote here?
[02:40:23.176 --> 02:40:23.777]  Yes, quote it.
[02:40:24.137 --> 02:40:24.497]  Alrighty.
[02:40:24.637 --> 02:40:26.559]  Here's the quote from Admiral Keating.
[02:40:26.579 --> 02:40:33.704]  The concept of a maritime NORAD has a large group of endorsers who envision an automated, ocean-wide, vessel-monitoring surveillance network.
[02:40:34.024 --> 02:40:41.009]  And then, Eberhard is scaremongering here, saying, it's just a matter of time until the terrorists try to use a seaborne attack, a maritime attack, against us.
[02:40:41.548 --> 02:40:43.030]  Again, we have more scaremongering.
[02:40:43.090 --> 02:40:51.779]  I mean, I think it's at the same time we see more... But when you hear him say maritime, the maritime system is a blanket with infrastructure protection.
[02:40:51.859 --> 02:40:52.439]  It's everything.
[02:40:53.480 --> 02:40:55.502]  Oh, I mean, and that's what I think we're talking about.
[02:40:55.543 --> 02:41:01.709]  I mean, they had a Northern Command Conference on C-SPAN the other day, and they were openly talking about martial law, saying we have to prepare our troops for martial law.
[02:41:02.855 --> 02:41:04.277]  I mean, this isn't something they're hiding.
[02:41:04.317 --> 02:41:09.641]  I'm wondering if this economic collapse, if now they're going to have to do a preemptive attack to blame it on the Arabs again.
[02:41:09.681 --> 02:41:10.462]  Hey, do this.
[02:41:10.722 --> 02:41:13.124]  Go to a sports bar.
[02:41:13.164 --> 02:41:15.846]  People are eating hot wings and hot beer.
[02:41:16.327 --> 02:41:20.971]  And walk up to a businessman making 100 grand a year and tell him the dollar just dropped by 40 plus percent.
[02:41:21.291 --> 02:41:22.272]  And they'll go, what's that mean?
[02:41:22.987 --> 02:41:24.028]  Well, Bush says it's good.
[02:41:25.650 --> 02:41:27.071]  They don't know what martial law is.
[02:41:27.091 --> 02:41:27.912]  They don't know any of it.
[02:41:28.232 --> 02:41:34.919]  But the question is, what is it they've got planned so horrible that they have been putting all this in place since long before 9-11?
[02:41:35.939 --> 02:41:39.380]  Listen, Alex, I'm in college, and when I talk to my teachers about this, they laugh at me.
[02:41:39.640 --> 02:41:41.600]  I talked to them about the collapse of the dollar today.
[02:41:41.620 --> 02:41:43.640]  I was talking to one of my professors, and he's laughing.
[02:41:43.660 --> 02:41:46.281]  He's saying, oh, oil will never get above $50 a barrel.
[02:41:46.341 --> 02:41:46.681]  Ha ha!
[02:41:46.921 --> 02:41:47.181]  Gold?
[02:41:47.241 --> 02:41:48.001]  Why would you buy gold?
[02:41:48.041 --> 02:41:48.721]  You're so ignorant.
[02:41:48.961 --> 02:41:51.382]  I think even the intellectual classes are so ignorant.
[02:41:51.422 --> 02:41:52.682]  The business classes are so ignorant.
[02:41:52.702 --> 02:41:57.923]  Well, they've been taught that to laugh at any real rational statement means they're intelligent.
[02:41:58.263 --> 02:42:05.084]  They believe holding a set of views is what makes them smart, not having the intellect to be able to analyze and understand society.
[02:42:05.544 --> 02:42:06.864]  Well, I mean, you look at what's happening.
[02:42:06.884 --> 02:42:10.425]  The Chinese banks have stopped infusing $1.6 billion as they need to every day.
[02:42:10.625 --> 02:42:14.206]  We have Karl Robin meet the press talking about the National Sales Tax openly.
[02:42:14.487 --> 02:42:17.387]  We have the Neocon Treasury Department raising the debt ceiling.
[02:42:17.667 --> 02:42:19.208]  Gold hitting a 16-year high.
[02:42:19.408 --> 02:42:20.668]  The collapse of manufacturing.
[02:42:20.948 --> 02:42:21.589]  $50 oil.
[02:42:21.869 --> 02:42:24.809]  The IMF and World Bank saying that there's an imminent collapse in the US dollar.
[02:42:24.829 --> 02:42:27.710]  Yeah, that's everything the old-timers told us 25 years ago.
[02:42:28.050 --> 02:42:28.690]  How did they know?
[02:42:28.710 --> 02:42:30.971]  Because we have the IMF and World Bank documents then!
[02:42:31.151 --> 02:42:32.011]  Thanks for the call!
[02:42:32.351 --> 02:42:32.932]  Absolutely.
[02:42:33.192 --> 02:42:33.972]  Good to hear from you.
[02:42:35.058 --> 02:42:36.299]  Oh man, I've got to really hurry now.
[02:42:36.319 --> 02:42:37.219]  I've got to cover this news.
[02:42:37.919 --> 02:42:39.080]  The calls are so good.
[02:42:39.100 --> 02:42:40.160]  Phillip in Virginia.
[02:42:40.180 --> 02:42:40.981]  Phillip, go ahead.
[02:42:41.521 --> 02:42:42.982]  Yeah, Alex, good to talk to you again.
[02:42:43.002 --> 02:42:45.903]  Hey, did you see what, the caller mentioned Karl Rove.
[02:42:46.263 --> 02:42:53.867]  He was on one of those shows the other day and he said that there was no bulge underneath Bush's jacket there.
[02:42:53.987 --> 02:42:55.087]  Did you hear about that?
[02:42:55.107 --> 02:42:56.728]  Yeah, we all saw the big bulge.
[02:42:56.748 --> 02:42:58.489]  Yeah, and we just flat out denied it.
[02:42:59.579 --> 02:43:04.387]  Well, I mean, Rumsfeld said it's an urban legend that he ever said that there were, uh, weapons of mass destruction.
[02:43:04.988 --> 02:43:05.329]  Oh, yeah.
[02:43:05.629 --> 02:43:07.012]  Well, you know... He never said that!
[02:43:07.232 --> 02:43:08.955]  Doesn't matter, they counted it up, it was over 130 times!
[02:43:10.874 --> 02:43:12.455]  Yeah, they're just bone-faced liars.
[02:43:13.456 --> 02:43:18.319]  And by the way, Ritalin and Prozac's good for your children, Mercury's good, and DU's good for the tribs?
[02:43:18.860 --> 02:43:20.441]  Oh yeah, let's all slurp it down.
[02:43:21.382 --> 02:43:24.304]  You know, there was like four reasons that I remember.
[02:43:24.344 --> 02:43:28.687]  We went to war in Iraq, and I can't remember the fourth one.
[02:43:28.747 --> 02:43:34.411]  Rape rooms, torture, Saddam abuses his people, martial law, weapons of mass destruction.
[02:43:35.742 --> 02:43:40.806]  Our government's increasing everything over there that our boy Saddam did.
[02:43:41.487 --> 02:43:47.392]  Oil, no-bid weapons contracts, protecting Israel, and those other ones you just mentioned.
[02:43:47.452 --> 02:43:50.034]  Oh, you're asking about their real motives, not their reasons, yeah.
[02:43:50.394 --> 02:43:52.035]  Right, yeah.
[02:43:52.135 --> 02:43:53.596]  You mean the real reasons, oh yeah.
[02:43:54.057 --> 02:43:54.217]  Yeah.
[02:43:57.230 --> 02:44:07.017]  Folks, if you ever come over to the Tidewater, Virginia, their court just ruled they gave the government carte blanche to just poison you any way they want to.
[02:44:07.057 --> 02:44:19.185]  They had a law sued about the THM levels in the water supply, and the lower court ruled that they could be sued, and they had a higher court guy just come in and declare sovereign immunity.
[02:44:19.845 --> 02:44:24.829]  But they say that the THMs are formed by chlorine mixing with the
[02:44:26.185 --> 02:44:28.947]  Yeah, that's the problem.
[02:44:28.967 --> 02:44:33.469]  When they put sodium fluoride in, it binds to all the chemicals, the dead bacteria.
[02:44:33.809 --> 02:44:36.731]  You're like drinking rotten, rotten meat.
[02:44:37.331 --> 02:44:41.353]  Well, why do they put chlorine in the water for disinfecting?
[02:44:41.393 --> 02:44:42.534]  Is that what they do it for?
[02:44:42.554 --> 02:44:43.014]  Yes.
[02:44:43.534 --> 02:44:45.235]  Okay, and one other thing.
[02:44:45.476 --> 02:44:48.657]  Hey folks, you put a fish in chlorine, it dies, but then you want to drink it.
[02:44:49.117 --> 02:44:51.239]  Yeah, it really makes a lot of sense.
[02:44:52.304 --> 02:45:00.889]  I was on the website and your program here on the station is not on the affiliate list.
[02:45:00.909 --> 02:45:03.170]  Do I email the webmaster there?
[02:45:03.550 --> 02:45:07.012]  We got, listen, the problem is we're busier than a one-legged man in a you-know-what.
[02:45:07.832 --> 02:45:11.475]  And, uh, we got a bunch of affiliates that we don't ever list.
[02:45:11.635 --> 02:45:12.996]  New affiliates we just learn about.
[02:45:13.096 --> 02:45:16.299]  Affiliates we don't have that have been sold that are wrong on there.
[02:45:16.699 --> 02:45:17.680]  We need a lot of help.
[02:45:17.800 --> 02:45:21.182]  Yeah, email webmasters, whatever stations you're listening to us on.
[02:45:21.222 --> 02:45:21.543]  Yes, sir.
[02:45:22.023 --> 02:45:22.443]  Okay, bud.
[02:45:23.204 --> 02:45:24.225]  Hey, I appreciate you.
[02:45:24.605 --> 02:45:25.225]  And you know what?
[02:45:25.305 --> 02:45:26.626]  I mean, I want to go to these calls.
[02:45:27.947 --> 02:45:30.730]  I'll jam Charles and Barbara in at the end if I got time.
[02:45:30.830 --> 02:45:32.211]  I just, I gotta get to know this here.
[02:45:34.020 --> 02:45:39.022]  I said I'd cover it all, and I covered probably sixty, seventy stories, but I got like a hundred and fifty here.
[02:45:40.043 --> 02:45:41.183]  I could spend an hour on this.
[02:45:41.263 --> 02:45:47.786]  Plane passengers shot by their x-ray scans in the United States, in Ireland, in the United Kingdom.
[02:45:48.507 --> 02:45:51.388]  It's gone from five terminals in the U.S.
[02:45:51.528 --> 02:45:53.229]  now to more, and then here's one out of England.
[02:45:53.769 --> 02:45:56.610]  Four terminals, four different airports.
[02:45:57.050 --> 02:46:00.192]  Of the naked image, this is the Times of London, the device
[02:46:00.812 --> 02:46:05.954]  A naked image of passengers by bouncing x-rays off the skin enabling staff instantly to spot a hidden weapon.
[02:46:06.294 --> 02:46:09.795]  It's recorded on digital hard drives and the British people are outraged.
[02:46:10.296 --> 02:46:15.057]  If they can make you and your family walk through and get recorded naked, they can make you do anything.
[02:46:16.158 --> 02:46:17.658]  Oh man, here's another one.
[02:46:17.678 --> 02:46:20.059]  This is out of London.
[02:46:20.219 --> 02:46:21.640]  And again, this is already here in the U.S.
[02:46:21.680 --> 02:46:23.400]  from Indiana to Texas to Illinois.
[02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:26.621]  License plate cameras to trap criminals, Irish criminals.
[02:46:26.661 --> 02:46:28.162]  Be warned, your number could soon be up.
[02:46:29.139 --> 02:46:35.321]  And it says they're planning to introduce new road cameras capable of scanning license plate numbers and matching them to people wanted for crimes, instantly.
[02:46:35.981 --> 02:46:39.822]  And it also scans wherever you go as a citizen, even the smallest towns in Texas.
[02:46:40.422 --> 02:46:43.203]  And now at every four-way stop, have them, now they're going into the neighborhoods.
[02:46:44.103 --> 02:46:50.944]  The automatic number plate recognition devices will be linked to computers storing police court records, alert offices if a criminal's car is identified.
[02:46:52.045 --> 02:46:53.145]  And soon we'll all be criminals.
[02:46:55.334 --> 02:46:59.077]  Google caught removing images of Abu Ghraib and not allowing it to be linked.
[02:46:59.097 --> 02:47:01.638]  When you type in Abu Ghraib photos, Google won't give it to you.
[02:47:02.099 --> 02:47:03.359]  Start using other search engines.
[02:47:05.101 --> 02:47:06.081]  Unless they stop that.
[02:47:07.822 --> 02:47:08.563]  World Net Daily.
[02:47:08.623 --> 02:47:10.604]  School backpack features satellite tracking.
[02:47:11.465 --> 02:47:14.187]  Responding to rising crimes against children of Tokyo manufacturers.
[02:47:14.227 --> 02:47:15.427]  Joining forces with security.
[02:47:16.008 --> 02:47:18.710]  And now they're going to make all the children carry GPS around with them.
[02:47:18.770 --> 02:47:20.030]  I'll keep them safe.
[02:47:20.070 --> 02:47:22.252]  Here is a giant 15 page report.
[02:47:24.867 --> 02:47:41.876]  Out of auto week, under the hood with Big Brother, and it says whether you like it or not, someday it will happen, even when people don't have wrecks, now the Honest Carb will call them and say collision detected, and some of the police to go after you, and it also tracks everything you're doing, and it's got a picture of an all-seeing eye scanning your carb.
[02:47:43.657 --> 02:47:45.378]  I literally have like 30 of these, okay?
[02:47:46.181 --> 02:47:47.421]  This is what I don't cover every day.
[02:47:47.641 --> 02:47:48.882]  There's like 30, 40 of these.
[02:47:49.082 --> 02:47:49.342]  More.
[02:47:49.362 --> 02:47:50.242]  I don't even look for them.
[02:47:50.562 --> 02:47:51.823]  Just masses of them.
[02:47:52.383 --> 02:47:53.383]  Uh, here's USA Today.
[02:47:53.483 --> 02:47:54.784]  CIA role inside the U.S.
[02:47:54.804 --> 02:47:55.104]  Greater.
[02:47:55.124 --> 02:47:59.545]  The CIA has assigned dozens of case officers and analysts to work with FBIs throughout the United States.
[02:48:00.305 --> 02:48:05.647]  And again, they have shows like Cops, which I now got mailed to me, where the CIA helps them bust a drug dealer in Miami.
[02:48:06.047 --> 02:48:07.468]  What does this have to do with terror?
[02:48:07.688 --> 02:48:08.768]  Well, all crime is terror.
[02:48:10.370 --> 02:48:13.472]  And it says the CIA will have offices in every city and town.
[02:48:13.512 --> 02:48:16.893]  They will work with local police to help identify potential terrorist threats and crimes.
[02:48:17.374 --> 02:48:19.975]  Those briefings have been reported by the New York Times earlier this year.
[02:48:19.995 --> 02:48:26.378]  I got stacks of it.
[02:48:26.438 --> 02:48:36.884]  Just stacks after stacks after stacks after stacks of torture and murder and poison in your food and just everywhere and just... Ah!
[02:48:37.893 --> 02:48:41.736]  And it's gonna get worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse!
[02:48:42.836 --> 02:48:43.537]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:45.879 --> 02:48:50.222]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[02:48:50.402 --> 02:48:54.845]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals, and operations of the New World Order.
[02:48:54.965 --> 02:48:59.348]  There is a chance to use this disaster for the New World Order.
[02:48:59.388 --> 02:49:00.749]  The New World Order.
[02:49:02.511 --> 02:49:06.757]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:49:06.797 --> 02:49:13.747]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart piece by piece and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:49:13.867 --> 02:49:15.890]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:49:16.271 --> 02:49:26.658]  Homeland Security, Executive Orders, Force Vaccinations, The New Prison Economy, The Total Information Society, The Pan-American Union, Federal Gun Grabs, Government Run, White Slavery Rings, and much, much more.
[02:49:26.858 --> 02:49:32.242]  If you want to understand what the New World Order really is, then my new two-and-a-half-hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.

[02:49:35.985 --> 02:49:36.485]  That's 888-253-3139.
[02:49:36.505 --> 02:49:37.806]  Order today and spread the word.
[02:49:45.231 --> 02:49:47.212]  You've asked for them and now they're here!
[02:49:47.292 --> 02:49:58.017]  Hello folks, Alex Jones introducing you to the new Berkey PF2 Fluoride and Arsenic Reduction Elements for exclusive use with the Berkey Light Black Berkey Purification Elements.
[02:49:58.377 --> 02:50:02.899]  The Berkey's PF2 simply screw onto the stem of the Black Berkey Purification Element.
[02:50:02.979 --> 02:50:14.304]  When used, water flows through the purification elements where pathogenic bacteria, harmful chemicals, radon-222, heavy metals, nitrates, foul taste and odors are separated from the water.
[02:50:14.904 --> 02:50:21.753]  The water then flows through the PF2 elements, where fluoride, arsenic, and other residual heavy metal ions are separated.
[02:50:22.153 --> 02:50:24.276]  Your purified water is now ready!
[02:50:24.777 --> 02:50:29.743]  If you have fluoride or arsenic in your water, you need the Berkey PF2 host filter elements.
[02:50:30.043 --> 02:50:36.347]  Get a set of two for only $49 or get two sets for only $89 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[02:50:36.427 --> 02:50:40.610]  And tell them Alex Jones sent you.
[02:50:40.830 --> 02:50:41.591]  That's toll free.
[02:50:41.611 --> 02:50:41.651]  888-803-4438.
[02:50:47.123 --> 02:50:47.444]  Thank you.
[02:51:02.285 --> 02:51:02.926]  We're good to go.

[02:51:31.802 --> 02:51:34.883]  We have been working hard since 1988 to save the remnant.
[02:51:35.063 --> 02:51:40.906]  That's HerbalHealer.com, your website for safe, effective natural alternatives and education.
[02:51:48.180 --> 02:51:54.204]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:51:54.825 --> 02:51:57.767]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:52:01.330 --> 02:52:05.053]  There's a Boston Herald article, Will the Chip Advance Civilization?
[02:52:05.073 --> 02:52:09.497]  The Government Mustn't Control Our Lives, the Benefits and Potential Use of the Vera Chips.
[02:52:10.177 --> 02:52:13.540]  And Rob Stein's October 14th article, FDA OKs Implantable
[02:52:14.404 --> 02:52:24.090]  Holding personal medical records, and then the article goes on to say it's a horrible idea and they're going to try to force us to take it, so now mainstream news articles saying it's a horrible idea, there's a move to force us to take it.
[02:52:26.091 --> 02:52:28.792]  Disillusion Yanks, I, New Zealand.
[02:52:29.473 --> 02:52:34.156]  Americans aren't just starting to flood to Canada, but New Zealand as well as other countries.
[02:52:34.256 --> 02:52:35.596]  You can run, but you can't hide.
[02:52:36.637 --> 02:52:37.678]  Again, there's no difference.
[02:52:39.018 --> 02:52:40.859]  You could stay here and actually fight and change things.
[02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:43.321]  There are a few third world countries you could evacuate to.
[02:52:44.455 --> 02:52:46.495]  Arafat's wife lashes out at officials.
[02:52:46.555 --> 02:52:47.356]  He's still alive.
[02:52:47.676 --> 02:52:49.056]  They said he was dead last week.
[02:52:49.096 --> 02:52:50.176]  This is just ridiculous.
[02:52:50.696 --> 02:52:52.837]  Man dies after police use stun gun on him.
[02:52:53.837 --> 02:52:55.217]  And they say we're going to keep using it.
[02:52:55.257 --> 02:52:55.877]  We don't care.
[02:52:55.897 --> 02:52:57.678]  The guy hid in his closet.
[02:52:57.698 --> 02:53:00.578]  They thought he was stealing electrical power so they killed him in Fort Worth.
[02:53:01.358 --> 02:53:07.640]  And they've had 70 deaths in the last two years alone from the Taser.
[02:53:07.900 --> 02:53:09.140]  Taser's own stun gun.
[02:53:10.023 --> 02:53:12.285]  The company admits it, but then they say how great it is.
[02:53:12.305 --> 02:53:14.267]  Yeah, it just trains them to be able to do this to us.
[02:53:15.228 --> 02:53:19.553]  Henry Kissinger, now back to defining a new world order.
[02:53:19.733 --> 02:53:23.637]  Herald Tribune headline about how we all need world government and how great it is.
[02:53:23.657 --> 02:53:27.741]  Another article there for you, and I said I'd get to
[02:53:28.573 --> 02:53:33.076]  This John Kamensky article, American Sunset, and this Chuck Baldwin article.
[02:53:33.116 --> 02:53:35.297]  I did get to the Chuck Baldwin, I didn't get to the Kamensky.
[02:53:35.597 --> 02:53:39.179]  I'll cover both those again tomorrow because they're so important.
[02:53:39.399 --> 02:53:43.682]  They're both posted on PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:53:43.702 --> 02:53:55.249]  Before I go to Charles and Barbara, the two final callers we have time to take, I do want to encourage all of you to go to PrisonPlanet.tv where eleven of my documentary films are.
[02:53:56.081 --> 02:54:04.868]  Now it's got to be 50-something of my weekly TV reports, hundreds of audio interviews, dozens of text reports that are just for members.
[02:54:05.428 --> 02:54:09.251]  PrisonPlanet.tv, 15 cents a day.
[02:54:09.271 --> 02:54:14.735]  If you already have a membership, give a $5.95 monthly subscription to a friend or member of the family.
[02:54:15.882 --> 02:54:22.307]  I've got a bunch of new deals out where you get four of my videos and a book for $59.95, a $53 discount.
[02:54:22.888 --> 02:54:25.910]  Even if you have some of the videos on the list, get them as the bulk to give as gifts.
[02:54:26.871 --> 02:54:31.935]  You can get 9-11 The Road to Tyranny for $24.95, almost three hours long, each additional copy $5.95 on DVD.
[02:54:34.392 --> 02:54:35.593]  That's an amazing deal.
[02:54:35.673 --> 02:54:39.134]  American dictators documenting the staged election of 2004, 1995, each additional $5.95.
[02:54:39.234 --> 02:54:40.135]  Take advantage of that.
[02:54:40.155 --> 02:54:40.215]  1-888-253-3139.
[02:54:50.999 --> 02:55:02.123]  That's 888-253-3139, or order hard copies of the films or books via Infowars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, the secure, safe shopping cart.
[02:55:02.203 --> 02:55:02.743]  Don't wait.
[02:55:03.043 --> 02:55:05.624]  Take action by exposing these murdering criminals.
[02:55:05.904 --> 02:55:07.124]  We can save this country.
[02:55:07.784 --> 02:55:09.405]  Charles in Rhode Island, go ahead.
[02:55:10.085 --> 02:55:10.665]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[02:55:11.126 --> 02:55:11.786]  I'm going to be fast.
[02:55:12.146 --> 02:55:16.147]  Basically, I heard some words the other day that if you employed them into your show that would be beautiful.
[02:55:16.807 --> 02:55:18.728]  Tyranny is better organized than freedom.
[02:55:19.707 --> 02:55:23.428]  Basically, people don't understand that freedom is something you have to fight for every day of your life.
[02:55:24.148 --> 02:55:24.488]  Okay?
[02:55:24.508 --> 02:55:25.348]  Thanks a lot, Alex.
[02:55:25.689 --> 02:55:26.309]  You're awesome.
[02:55:26.349 --> 02:55:27.689]  No, no, he's absolutely correct.
[02:55:28.069 --> 02:55:35.371]  It's centralized, it's got the wealth, but it has to count on us, the little people, going along with it, being fractured, being balkanized.
[02:55:35.691 --> 02:55:40.392]  We've got to come together on real issues, like the national ID card they're about to pass.
[02:55:40.792 --> 02:55:42.613]  Barbara, in Utah.
[02:55:42.633 --> 02:55:43.513]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:55:43.933 --> 02:55:45.554]  No, it's not Utah, it's Washington.
[02:55:45.574 --> 02:55:46.114]  Okay, go ahead.
[02:55:46.594 --> 02:55:47.374]  No dictator.
[02:55:48.038 --> 02:55:50.500]  An invader can hold an imprisoned population forever.
[02:55:50.520 --> 02:55:55.204]  There's no greater power in the world than the need for freedom.
[02:55:56.164 --> 02:56:01.528]  And against that power, no government, or no tyranny, or army can stand.
[02:56:02.349 --> 02:56:03.930]  Now that was my first statement.
[02:56:04.090 --> 02:56:05.752]  And whose quote is that?
[02:56:05.792 --> 02:56:06.352]  I forget.
[02:56:06.712 --> 02:56:10.255]  It was out of a... Who wrote that?
[02:56:10.275 --> 02:56:11.456]  Kuczynski.
[02:56:12.157 --> 02:56:12.997]  His name is...
[02:56:16.081 --> 02:56:18.543]  Yeah, be sure and email that to me.
[02:56:18.563 --> 02:56:19.404]  That's a great quote.
[02:56:19.924 --> 02:56:21.385]  Okay, but I'm 77.
[02:56:21.685 --> 02:56:27.870]  In years, but in actuality, I'm only 20.
[02:56:29.331 --> 02:56:30.652]  I'm going to have to let you finish tomorrow.
[02:56:30.692 --> 02:56:31.773]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:56:31.813 --> 02:56:32.573]  I'm sorry, Barbara.
[02:56:33.014 --> 02:56:34.615]  For some Planet Doc TV, back tonight.
