[00:00:08.886 --> 00:00:15.790]  Nazi treasure has been used by the globalists to take over the United States.
[00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.233]  And they are setting up a fourth Reich right here in America.
[00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:27.437]  Sounds amazing, but if you look at the evidence, any good investigator would tell you that there is no other conclusion.
[00:00:27.437 --> 00:00:30.439]  It is documented and the mainstream media is complicit.
[00:00:31.314 --> 00:00:37.438]  The same people who funded Hitler are now involved running the same system here in America.
[00:00:37.438 --> 00:00:44.203]  And yes, even putting Hitler lovers in as governor of the fifth largest economy on the planet.
[00:00:44.203 --> 00:00:46.144]  New massive developments have come out.
[00:00:46.144 --> 00:00:49.166]  The London Guardian thanks to, yes, John Buchanan's work.
[00:00:49.166 --> 00:00:51.808]  He told me about this three weeks ago, how this story was about to come out.
[00:00:53.274 --> 00:00:58.399]  And now it has, with exact details he said it would, and he's got even new revelations for us.
[00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:11.213]  But before we go to John Buchanan, investigative journalist, award-winning journalist, and incredible activist, helped bring down Nixon, we are going to spend a few minutes here telling you about my documentary films.
[00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:14.895]  My 11th film is now out.
[00:01:14.895 --> 00:01:16.837]  American Dictators.
[00:01:16.837 --> 00:01:19.458]  It's 90 minutes long.
[00:01:19.458 --> 00:01:19.999]  1995.
[00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:22.420]  Documenting the staged election of 2004.
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.682]  How Bush and Carrier are cousins, skull and bones.
[00:01:25.682 --> 00:01:27.163]  We go back to Bohemian Grove.
[00:01:27.163 --> 00:01:31.506]  We cover their policies, the police state, the latest 9-11 information.
[00:01:31.506 --> 00:01:33.047]  It is a great new video.
[00:01:34.446 --> 00:01:36.451]  It is, American Dictators.
[00:01:36.451 --> 00:01:41.343]  My other films are all over two hours, like Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[00:01:41.343 --> 00:01:43.068]  It's two hours, forty-four minutes long.
[00:01:43.988 --> 00:01:44.789]  It's 2595 like my other 10 videos.
[00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.651]  $20 a piece if you order three or more of any of my original ten films.
[00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:18.694]  Whether it's 9-11, The Road to Tyranny, or Masters of Terror, Police State 3, Total Enslavement, or the new film Matrix of Evil.

[00:02:47.493 --> 00:02:52.374]  I want to thank those that have done this and I want to ask those that haven't to please get the films and do it.
[00:02:52.374 --> 00:02:57.295]  Or if you have the videos and you haven't made copies, to please take action and stop procrastinating.

[00:02:58.435 --> 00:02:59.956]  The ball is in your court.
[00:02:59.956 --> 00:03:01.676]  Nothing happens if you don't take action.

[00:03:19.497 --> 00:03:20.298]  We have those.

[00:04:09.762 --> 00:04:11.363]  Incredible job this guy did.
[00:04:12.123 --> 00:04:15.006]  You need to go and sign up at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:04:15.006 --> 00:04:16.607]  15 cents a day.
[00:04:16.607 --> 00:04:19.369]  We cannot offer this stuff free anymore because of bandwidth.
[00:04:19.369 --> 00:04:21.631]  I can't pay $5,000 bandwidth bills.
[00:04:21.631 --> 00:04:24.393]  So that's why a lot of this stuff is free, a lot of it isn't.
[00:04:24.393 --> 00:04:30.678]  You're helping subsidize so others who've never heard of this before can come to the sites and watch a lot of videos and clips for free.
[00:04:30.678 --> 00:04:32.420]  So support what we're doing.

[00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:35.562]  Sign up today.
[00:04:35.562 --> 00:04:37.364]  Alright, I want to thank him for holding.
[00:04:37.364 --> 00:04:39.366]  I want to thank listeners for being patient.
[00:04:39.366 --> 00:04:40.707]  Your calls are coming up as well.
[00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:51.021]  John Buchanan, quickly, in 60 seconds, tell us who you are, a little bit of your history, and then I want to toot your horn for you.
[00:04:51.021 --> 00:04:52.282]  Let me just toot the horn right now.
[00:04:53.197 --> 00:04:54.198]  I was in New York.
[00:04:54.198 --> 00:04:55.399]  I interviewed John before.
[00:04:55.399 --> 00:05:11.390]  I was well aware of his work from a year ago, out of the oldest and most respected newspaper in the country, documenting the Bush-Nazi connections into the 1950s, taking those billions of dollars of Nazi funds into Argentina, into Midland, Texas.
[00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:13.251]  Folks, my grandfather worked in the oil business.
[00:05:13.251 --> 00:05:15.473]  He said all you would see were these rich Nazis in Midland.
[00:05:15.993 --> 00:05:16.974]  You know, hanging out.
[00:05:16.974 --> 00:05:18.275]  I've talked to other oil men.
[00:05:18.275 --> 00:05:21.098]  You know, the Nazis hanging out at the Bush House.
[00:05:21.098 --> 00:05:23.480]  This is stuff I knew as a kid.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:30.686]  You know, being here in Texas, having family on both sides that were, you know, low level in the oil business.
[00:05:30.686 --> 00:05:33.269]  It's a very small family.
[00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:34.290]  Small group of people.
[00:05:35.467 --> 00:05:37.309]  And so I already knew a lot of this.
[00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:43.093]  And then I knew about Tarpley's book from decades ago, about the Bushes and the Nazis.
[00:05:43.093 --> 00:05:46.336]  I have mainstream news articles from 1942, 1941, 1943.
[00:05:46.336 --> 00:05:51.800]  Those are on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.466]  But this guy that we're talking to spent weeks in the National Archives just digging through giant rooms of documents.
[00:05:58.466 --> 00:06:00.468]  It's all there.
[00:06:00.468 --> 00:06:01.889]  And he found the documents
[00:06:04.136 --> 00:06:07.564]  Expanding on all of this and three weeks ago in New York.
[00:06:07.564 --> 00:06:09.428]  He told me in a hotel room interview.
[00:06:09.428 --> 00:06:13.738]  We did this in an upcoming film It'll be out in a few months called martial law
[00:06:15.265 --> 00:06:19.627]  Where we talk about the past of the plan to overthrow the U.S.
[00:06:19.627 --> 00:06:21.469]  with a 4th Reich.
[00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:26.291]  Back during World War II, the Butchers wanted a 3rd Reich with their big banker controllers.
[00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:31.274]  And he laid out how he'd been with the Guardian, how he'd showed them the documents, how it was coming out very soon.
[00:06:31.274 --> 00:06:35.797]  And there's several books coming out that are based on the research of John Buchanan.
[00:06:36.457 --> 00:06:39.538]  And so John is a hero, but he's also more than a hero.
[00:06:39.538 --> 00:06:44.580]  He's an example of how motivated individuals can change history.
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:54.844]  And we're honored to have John Buchanan on with us, not just with the 13-page London Guardian article, biggest paper in Europe, but he has new developments that nobody else has.
[00:06:54.844 --> 00:06:56.105]  John, good to have you on with us.
[00:06:56.705 --> 00:06:57.665]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[00:06:57.665 --> 00:06:59.426]  It's always a pleasure.
[00:06:59.426 --> 00:07:14.729]  To give you the update and the new stuff, since you have so well summarized my past in the last year, there have been some really incredible developments, especially in terms of timing.
[00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:25.412]  But after The Guardian reporter left the archives on August 10th, I found new documents that I had not seen before and have
[00:07:27.759 --> 00:07:40.784]  Nobody's ever even hinted that they could find our documents that link them directly to IG Farben, the operators of the death camp at Auschwitz.
[00:07:40.784 --> 00:07:48.287]  And Polish Newsweek, as you know, the Polish edition of Newsweek, had that story in early 2003.
[00:07:48.287 --> 00:07:54.989]  Michael Isikoff, the star reporter at Newsweek who wrote about Monica Lewinsky's sperm-stained dress and thought that was newsworthy.
[00:07:55.029 --> 00:07:55.589]  We're good to go.
[00:08:11.616 --> 00:08:23.761]  As you also know from the papers I discovered last year, W. Averill Harriman, the big daddy partner that gave Prescott Bush his start in the Nazi business, was one of the original owners of Newsweek.
[00:08:23.761 --> 00:08:27.283]  So the media complicity and cover-up goes back 70 years.
[00:08:27.283 --> 00:08:34.746]  So now we know from new documents I have in my possession, which include, by the way, the date is what's significant.
[00:08:35.106 --> 00:08:36.167]  We're good to go.
[00:08:56.538 --> 00:09:22.512]  called me late Friday afternoon from the National Archives and she found even more explosive documents that she has in her possession today that they were shareholders in IG Farben, stockholders in IG Farben which made them shareholders in the death camp at Auschwitz and that they moved Nazi assets that she had never discovered into Chile after the war.
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:28.822]  Now, for those that just joined us, there's a detailed 13-page report on the London Guardian.
[00:09:28.822 --> 00:09:41.366]  Suit has been filed by slave laborers from Auschwitz against the Bush family themselves, and now we've learned that's why the Bushes blocked some different treaties on war crimes, because this will protect them.
[00:09:41.366 --> 00:09:49.188]  Now we know why they've got Arnold, who openly says he loves Hitler, why they're grooming him for the presidency in 08.
[00:09:49.188 --> 00:09:50.689]  When you start looking at the webs,
[00:09:51.229 --> 00:09:56.996]  You also have documented how back in the 30's they had a plan to overthrow the U.S.
[00:09:56.996 --> 00:10:00.619]  and set up a third Reich here, how that failed.
[00:10:00.619 --> 00:10:09.109]  Now they're trying it again, even with the same name, Reich Security or Land Security, down to the black uniforms and the watch list.
[00:10:09.369 --> 00:10:09.949]  Correct.
[00:10:09.949 --> 00:10:23.920]  And there was another, I don't know if you heard this overnight or your staff saw it this morning, but I've been talking about this for a year and the New York Times won't pay any attention to this little tidbit either, but you know very well who Reinhard Galen was, the Nazi
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.501]  General who was in fact the founder of the CIA.
[00:10:28.501 --> 00:10:52.345]  Well, after 50 years of denial, UPI reported that story over the weekend and the American government has acknowledged documents found at the National Archives in another court case that Nazi General and war criminal Reinhard Galen was in fact the grandfather of the CIA and brought in Nazi war criminals and henchmen
[00:10:52.705 --> 00:10:53.245]  Let me stop you.
[00:10:53.245 --> 00:10:54.226]  I gotta stop right here.
[00:10:54.226 --> 00:10:57.048]  I wanna go back over the whole history of this.
[00:10:57.048 --> 00:10:59.630]  I wanna spend a lot of time on this, John.
[00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:01.231]  How long do you have with us?
[00:11:16.155 --> 00:11:17.076]  Your phone's cutting out.
[00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:17.937]  How long do you have with us?
[00:11:17.937 --> 00:11:19.138]  Alright, as long as you need me.
[00:11:19.138 --> 00:11:23.884]  Well, let's keep you for the full next hour, but I want to stop you right there.
[00:11:23.884 --> 00:11:27.228]  For those that... I'm going to talk about 9-11 now.
[00:11:27.228 --> 00:11:30.792]  For those that don't understand how Al-Qaeda works for the CIA,
[00:11:33.292 --> 00:11:35.534]  Or how Saddam worked for the CIA.
[00:11:35.534 --> 00:11:37.715]  Or how Noriega worked for the CIA.
[00:11:37.715 --> 00:11:41.338]  Or how Fidel Castro worked for the CIA.
[00:11:41.338 --> 00:11:43.780]  Or how Ho Chi Minh worked for the CIA.
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:47.502]  Or how the CIA now admits they put Mao Zedong into power in 1950.
[00:11:47.502 --> 00:11:49.204]  This is now admitted on the History Channel.
[00:11:49.804 --> 00:11:56.366]  The globalists go out and create boogeymen, create war machines, create enemies.
[00:11:56.366 --> 00:12:06.749]  Then when they bring the country down, all of their double agents who are working for them, whether they're Al-Qaeda or the Ba'ath Party or Noriega's top men,
[00:12:07.429 --> 00:12:15.619]  They all then get brought back to the US or settled in Switzerland or Spain or Argentina and are very well taken care of.
[00:12:15.619 --> 00:12:19.643]  They even fly back here and do seminars for their own client groups.
[00:12:19.643 --> 00:12:22.527]  So, just like in the middle of the Afghan war,
[00:12:23.757 --> 00:12:35.807]  All these C-130s land in Kabul and fly out the Taliban-Al Qaeda cream, and Special Forces commanders watch this with their mouths hanging open, or they do capture them in order to release them.
[00:12:35.807 --> 00:12:38.209]  It's because they're CIA folks.
[00:12:38.209 --> 00:12:43.013]  Just like the Nazis were brought here after World War II, well, they never really left.
[00:12:43.513 --> 00:12:56.324]  They were there to build up this boogeyman, to build up Germany, then bring Germany down from within and use Germany as a crisis creator to bring in the UN, the second wave of the failed League of Nations.
[00:12:56.324 --> 00:12:57.845]  So understand this.
[00:12:57.845 --> 00:13:08.594]  Our rocketry programs, our fighter programs, our CIA programs, our military programs, down to our schools, Department of Education,
[00:13:09.969 --> 00:13:14.577]  The Nazis were seen as the cutting edge of what the New World Order wanted.
[00:13:14.577 --> 00:13:19.404]  So after they brought them down, they brought them here to run everything.
[00:13:19.404 --> 00:13:23.010]  So it's the same story over and over and over again.
[00:13:23.010 --> 00:13:24.232]  Wall Street funds Hitler.
[00:13:25.089 --> 00:13:29.814]  Creates it, then brings it down, but moves the same system over here.
[00:13:29.814 --> 00:13:31.476]  It's the same thing with Al Qaeda.
[00:13:31.476 --> 00:13:33.198]  It's the same thing with everything.
[00:13:33.198 --> 00:13:35.821]  These guys are inside operators.
[00:13:35.821 --> 00:13:36.682]  Go ahead.
[00:13:36.682 --> 00:13:43.190]  Anyway, Alex, we're in Scoop City today because that brings up something else I've got for you.
[00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:52.155]  That it can be your exclusive and you can have her on as early as tomorrow if you'd like because she goes directly to that point.
[00:13:52.155 --> 00:13:59.840]  You may have heard of her but I wasn't familiar with her story until I talked to her last week and I just gave her story to a major U.S.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:02.902]  reporter who is in Texas as we speak.
[00:14:02.902 --> 00:14:10.587]  Her name is Indira Singh and she worked for 10 years at JPMorgan Chase in New York City.
[00:14:10.587 --> 00:14:11.408]  Her job
[00:14:12.208 --> 00:14:21.035]  ...was to track insider trading and financial fraud on Wall Street as a senior level risk management consultant.
[00:14:21.035 --> 00:14:33.345]  She began working with a new software program called P-TECH, capital P, small t, e, c, h. And I don't know if you've ever heard of P-TECH or your listeners have, but here's what's interesting about the story.
[00:14:33.345 --> 00:14:34.907]  Well, it's very similar to Promise.
[00:14:35.461 --> 00:14:37.622]  Correct, it's very similar to Promise, thank you.
[00:14:37.622 --> 00:14:49.445]  And P-TECH not only has, it's a master builder software program that in turn builds other generations of so-called enterprise, meaning basically business or operational software.
[00:14:49.445 --> 00:14:56.267]  Well, the connection to 911 is that number one, it's embedded in NORAD's command and control system.
[00:14:56.907 --> 00:14:59.408]  Every military computer system in the U.S.
[00:14:59.408 --> 00:15:02.069]  government, every agency of the U.S.
[00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:05.191]  government, including the CIA, and guess what?
[00:15:05.191 --> 00:15:06.511]  This won't surprise your listeners.
[00:15:06.511 --> 00:15:14.014]  It's funded by Saudi Arabian funders of terrorists and Al-Qaeda, has direct connections to Osama bin Laden.
[00:15:14.014 --> 00:15:22.118]  When she brought that up, and the two co-founders of P-TECH are on the FBI's terrorism watch list and were apprehended after 9-1-1.
[00:15:23.318 --> 00:15:24.159]  Guess what?
[00:15:24.159 --> 00:15:27.562]  P-TECH is still in business in Quincy, Massachusetts.
[00:15:27.562 --> 00:15:36.869]  CBS News had that story and was going to report it on our buddy Dan Rather's evening news show a year after 9-1-1, September 11, 2002.
[00:15:36.869 --> 00:15:42.714]  And for national security reasons, the White House shut down the story.
[00:15:42.714 --> 00:15:49.399]  The headline of the story was, P-TECH software that ran NORAD and the CIA, funded by
[00:15:49.879 --> 00:15:55.701]  Arab funders of terrorists and the CIA funded the attacks of 9-1-1.
[00:15:55.701 --> 00:15:56.422]  Unbelievable.
[00:15:56.422 --> 00:15:58.202]  And she documents to prove it.
[00:15:58.202 --> 00:15:59.503]  And she fears for her life.
[00:15:59.503 --> 00:16:11.708]  She is one of the few private citizens put under secret service protection by Senator Charles Grassley, the Republican from Iowa, a year and a half ago.
[00:16:11.708 --> 00:16:15.129]  And after Grassley came to her aid,
[00:16:16.149 --> 00:16:17.931]  and tried to open an investigation.
[00:16:17.931 --> 00:16:33.722]  The White House came down on him, and I've been trying to get his office to call me back for a week, and they're such cowards, Alex, that even Senator Charles Grassley won't call back, won't stand up for the American people, won't come out with the truth.
[00:16:33.722 --> 00:16:43.730]  And the reason that I wanted to be on with you today and break this stuff is that you are much more of a patriot and you have much more of a vast audience than I do,
[00:16:44.250 --> 00:17:03.659]  And I respect that fact, and I know what you've done to get out big stories, and we need... The only way I can see, Alex, that we can do anything between now and the election is to bring the wrath of the American people down on the press and down on the Congress, because they have... To my mind, the Congress and the press are more guilty of treason than Bush.
[00:17:03.659 --> 00:17:05.900]  In that they're cowards and they're running from the truth.
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:13.165]  Well, John Buchanan, we'll have a transcript created from this broadcast in the next few days.
[00:17:13.165 --> 00:17:16.687]  We'll get this audio posted and one of our great listeners will make a transcript.
[00:17:16.687 --> 00:17:19.489]  That way millions can read it immediately.
[00:17:19.489 --> 00:17:32.898]  But, John, when we come back from break, because I've gotten you to diverge, digress, excuse me, but I want to go back through the Nazi background, Fritz Thiessen, who the Bushes are, who the Walkers are.
[00:17:32.898 --> 00:17:34.079]  I want to lead this up to the 50s.
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:53.405]  And then I want to bring it up to 2004 how they're recreating this and these latest development suits filed by Auschwitz survivors against the Bushes for being shareholders in IG Farben, one of the most well-known death camps being Auschwitz.
[00:17:53.405 --> 00:17:54.505]  We'll be right back.
[00:17:54.505 --> 00:17:55.085]  Stay with us.

[00:21:02.405 --> 00:21:09.053]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[00:21:09.053 --> 00:21:15.620]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.984]  Alright, going back to John Buchanan, investigative journalist.
[00:21:18.984 --> 00:21:21.387]  John, we got about four minutes here in this little segment.
[00:21:22.372 --> 00:21:31.079]  Give us thumbnail, the history, the Bushes, their patrons, what we know, and then we'll get into these new developments.
[00:21:31.079 --> 00:21:45.370]  Okay, and as I made with you the first time that I was on with y'all, I want to make a very important point to start with, which is that when I found this stuff on the internet at TakeBackTheMedia.com last August, I didn't believe it.
[00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:49.654]  Even though I hate the Bush family and would do anything to get them out of power,
[00:21:50.355 --> 00:21:50.795]  I don't know.
[00:22:06.617 --> 00:22:18.989]  These documents just couldn't possibly be there, and being a reputable journalist, if they weren't there, I would have a moral obligation to report that and say these horrible rumors on the internet are not true.
[00:22:18.989 --> 00:22:28.759]  Within one eight-hour workday, I had accumulated authenticated copies of over 300 pages of documents that confirmed everything
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.140]  They've been on the internet for decades.
[00:22:31.140 --> 00:22:37.582]  They've been out for decades and rumors in Europe and in obscure books and then on the internet for at least 10 years.
[00:22:37.582 --> 00:22:53.045]  That in late 1942, as a direct result of an explosive story, July 30th, 1942, in the New York Herald Tribune under the headline, Hitler's Angel Has 3 Million in US Bank.
[00:22:53.405 --> 00:23:02.770]  By the way, we have, there were several articles, those 1942 articles, the actual scans of the mainstream newsprint stories on the website.
[00:23:02.770 --> 00:23:04.011]  Oh, fantastic, yeah.
[00:23:04.011 --> 00:23:12.295]  And so, three weeks, what's interesting about that story, when you consider that this has been covered up for 70 years, what's most interesting to me about that
[00:23:14.413 --> 00:23:17.176]  But there's another one that does!
[00:23:17.176 --> 00:23:18.338]  But there's another...
[00:23:34.836 --> 00:23:39.502]  The government comes down on him under the Trading with the Enemy Act.
[00:23:39.502 --> 00:23:49.133]  The first seizure was in late August of 1942, and that was a Hamburg-American line which brought Nazi spies into the U.S.
[00:23:49.133 --> 00:23:51.936]  in the 1930s, offered $1,000 to U.S.
[00:23:51.936 --> 00:23:55.360]  citizens who would go to Germany and proselytize for Hitler.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.820]  I don't know.
[00:24:17.628 --> 00:24:18.028]  We're good.
[00:24:34.930 --> 00:24:35.991]  And went over everything.
[00:24:35.991 --> 00:24:45.515]  I just had a journalist's instinct, for lack of a better term, that in one eight-hour day I couldn't have covered everything and I should go to the Library of Congress.
[00:24:45.515 --> 00:24:47.816]  And so I went back a couple of weeks later.
[00:24:47.816 --> 00:24:53.099]  And when I went back, I spent multiple days in the archives in the Library of Congress.
[00:24:53.099 --> 00:25:00.963]  And that's when I found the documents nobody had ever seen and something that had never been reported by anybody or even in any book.
[00:25:01.503 --> 00:25:14.253]  And that was that after being warned over and over again, after being seized under the Trading with the Enemy Act to cease and desist in their Nazi dealings, incredibly they kept doing it until 1951.
[00:25:16.414 --> 00:25:24.357]  And they didn't stop doing it until their Nazi patron, the German steel and coal baron, Fritz Thiessen, died in Argentina.
[00:25:24.357 --> 00:25:33.741]  And after the war, on his behalf and on behalf of other Nazis, they moved assets into Switzerland, Brazil, Chile, Argentina, and Panama.
[00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:36.062]  And I have those documents as well.
[00:25:36.062 --> 00:25:36.962]  We got a break.
[00:25:36.962 --> 00:25:40.904]  And we also have mainstream news articles that do say the Bush names.
[00:25:40.904 --> 00:25:41.384]  Headline,
[00:25:48.125 --> 00:25:49.427]  Big Brother.
[00:25:49.427 --> 00:25:51.188]  Mainstream media.
[00:25:51.188 --> 00:25:52.950]  Government cover-ups.
[00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:54.531]  You want answers?
[00:25:54.531 --> 00:25:56.093]  Well, so does he.
[00:25:56.093 --> 00:26:00.277]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:26:00.277 --> 00:26:04.341]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:26:05.869 --> 00:26:07.010]  It is Monday.
[00:26:07.010 --> 00:26:08.331]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:26:08.331 --> 00:26:11.694]  It is the 27th day of September, 2004.
[00:26:11.694 --> 00:26:13.456]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:26:13.456 --> 00:26:21.363]  We're talking to investigative journalist and well-known activist, even back to the Watergate days, one of the people credited with finally bringing Nixon down.
[00:26:21.363 --> 00:26:23.404]  He is John Buchanan.
[00:26:24.125 --> 00:26:27.549]  John Buchanan for the last year has been researching Bush-Nazi ties.
[00:26:27.549 --> 00:26:29.772]  He spent a lot of time in the National Archives.
[00:26:29.772 --> 00:26:32.094]  He was one of the main sources to the London Guardian.
[00:26:32.094 --> 00:26:33.876]  He told me about this three weeks ago.
[00:26:33.876 --> 00:26:42.046]  It popped up Friday in the London Guardian, a 13-page report with a definitive headline, How Bush's Grandfather Helped Hitler's Rise to Power.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.381]  Now none of this is a secret.
[00:26:44.381 --> 00:26:49.264]  I have articles from 1942 naming Bush and Nazi companies that were seized.
[00:26:49.264 --> 00:26:54.187]  Prescott Bush, the grandfather of the current president, father of Bush 41.
[00:26:54.187 --> 00:26:58.990]  And they list Mr. Prescott Bush as being on the board of directors.
[00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:14.823]  Then Mr. Buchanan found in the National Archives the documents of the Bushes running the Nazi nest eggs out of Switzerland and Germany and other areas up until at least 1951-52.
[00:27:14.823 --> 00:27:19.347]  Now new documents have come out and he's got some of the latest developments for us.
[00:27:19.347 --> 00:27:27.414]  And of course there's two big books coming out in Europe by very respected journalists on this subject based on his research and other distinguished journalist research.
[00:27:28.863 --> 00:27:40.790]  And on top of this, two Auschwitz slave labor survivors have filed multi-billion dollar lawsuits against the Bush family, because now we learn they were shareholders in IG Farben directly running Auschwitz.
[00:27:40.790 --> 00:27:46.914]  John Buchanan, picking up now on the three minutes we've got left in this short segment, then we'll come back and get into more detail.
[00:27:46.914 --> 00:27:51.717]  You brought us up to 1942, and then right up into 1951.
[00:27:51.717 --> 00:27:55.419]  Give us some more examples of how this Nazi web was operating.
[00:27:56.147 --> 00:28:05.775]  Well, basically, the paper trail, as far as I and Eva Schweitzer can determine, ends in 1951.
[00:28:05.775 --> 00:28:13.001]  Now, what happened between 1951, though, and the mid-1970s is very important.
[00:28:13.001 --> 00:28:22.349]  The Dulles family, John Foster Dulles, who would later go on to become Secretary of State, and his brother, Alan Dulles, who
[00:28:22.449 --> 00:28:28.531]  He was the head of the OSS, the Office of Strategic Services, in Berlin.
[00:28:28.531 --> 00:28:30.551]  And created the CIA with Nazis.
[00:28:30.551 --> 00:28:31.211]  Correct.
[00:28:31.211 --> 00:28:32.972]  He's the nominal creator.
[00:28:32.972 --> 00:28:45.215]  That's what's incredible about the CIA's admission, finally, in this court case, as of today, by UPI, that, in fact, Reinhard Galen was the real founder of the CIA.
[00:28:45.215 --> 00:28:47.456]  So it was founded by a Nazi.
[00:28:47.456 --> 00:28:51.237]  But the PR packaging was that Alan Dulles was the founder.
[00:28:51.597 --> 00:29:00.383]  So what happened is that to really connect the dots, your listeners have to understand what happened in 1947 when the National Security Act was passed.
[00:29:00.383 --> 00:29:08.988]  And when the National Security Act was passed and the CIA was created, what was the very first thing they did, and who did it?
[00:29:08.988 --> 00:29:11.250]  None other than Alan Dulles.
[00:29:11.250 --> 00:29:13.291]  They subverted the entire U.S.
[00:29:13.291 --> 00:29:16.613]  media, which is in my book, Fixing America, coming out in two weeks.
[00:29:16.613 --> 00:29:16.953]  I think?
[00:29:46.613 --> 00:29:47.214]  We're good to go.
[00:30:09.915 --> 00:30:10.535]  We're good to go.
[00:30:32.486 --> 00:30:40.773]  They destroyed all of the documents in their possession and the top management executives of Brown Brothers Harriman should be criminally prosecuted.
[00:30:40.773 --> 00:30:41.933]  We got them right!
[00:30:41.933 --> 00:30:42.374]  Got them right!

[00:32:50.295 --> 00:32:51.856]  That's right folks, DVD.
[00:32:51.856 --> 00:32:54.238]  The original film was 144 minutes long.
[00:32:54.238 --> 00:32:56.580]  The DVD version is 170 minutes.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:33:01.864]  If you want to wake up your friends and families to the truth of what happened on September 11th, this is the film for you.
[00:33:01.864 --> 00:33:05.887]  The Road to Tyranny is already sending shockwaves through Washington and across the United States.
[00:33:06.127 --> 00:33:07.989]  You absolutely must see this DVD.
[00:33:07.989 --> 00:33:18.801]  It covers the history of government-sponsored terrorism, the police state and homeland security, the nightmare UN population control programs, the cashless society control grid, satellite tracking and plentiful microchips, and much, much more.
[00:33:18.801 --> 00:33:20.664]  Bottom line, this film is waking people up.
[00:33:21.084 --> 00:33:21.544]  Big Brother.
[00:33:49.469 --> 00:33:51.230]  Mainstream media.
[00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:52.952]  Government cover-ups.
[00:33:52.952 --> 00:33:54.573]  You want answers?
[00:33:54.573 --> 00:33:56.134]  Well, so does he.
[00:33:56.134 --> 00:34:00.317]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:34:00.317 --> 00:34:04.501]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:10.705]  Alright, we're now 8 minutes and 30 seconds into the second hour.
[00:34:10.705 --> 00:34:16.530]  And I want to try to get this concept across to people.
[00:34:19.474 --> 00:34:22.597]  I wasn't the only one that used this analogy.
[00:34:22.597 --> 00:34:41.654]  I think I was the first to do it, but later the Washington Post, in an article, compared what George Bush was doing with Bin Laden to what the Emperor in Star Wars II, Attack of the Clones, was doing.
[00:34:41.654 --> 00:34:43.616]  And you're saying, Alex, where are you going with this?
[00:34:45.287 --> 00:34:50.909]  Well, let's use a children's movie analogy so people can understand this.
[00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:57.012]  I imagine a lot of you, and I'm not talking down to you, it was hard for me to get this concept.
[00:34:57.012 --> 00:35:03.614]  But in Attack of the Clones, you have this leader of the Senate.
[00:35:03.614 --> 00:35:05.935]  He's not yet the Emperor.
[00:35:05.935 --> 00:35:12.638]  He's really the head of this evil occult order that's running things.
[00:35:15.038 --> 00:35:30.226]  And he needs to have a galaxy-wide crisis, or a series of crises, to build up this giant imperial army so he can oppress the entire population of these systems.
[00:35:30.226 --> 00:35:40.032]  And to do that, he dispatches Darth Tyranus, who goes and creates these armies who then attack innocent planets.
[00:35:40.768 --> 00:35:55.222]  Then the leader of the Senate, Darth Sidious, gets to, poses the good guy and says, we've got to have this giant galactic army and this empire to keep everybody safe.
[00:35:55.222 --> 00:35:59.185]  And then the last scene of the movie, in episode 2, you have
[00:36:02.642 --> 00:36:18.574]  Darth Tyranus, who's known as Count Dooku, as Osama Bin Laden, as Mao Zedong, as Adolf Hitler, as Manuel Noriega, as Saddam Hussein, he flies back and then has a secret meeting with the new Emperor.
[00:36:18.574 --> 00:36:26.479]  He's now the Emperor, and the last scene is the Star Destroyers taking off in the Imperial Battle March music.
[00:36:26.479 --> 00:36:28.061]  And people reading this transcript later
[00:36:29.192 --> 00:36:34.195]  You need to understand I'm using this as an analogy for the young people that are listening.
[00:36:34.195 --> 00:36:44.801]  And so the exact same thing that's in a children's movie that children can get is something adults and people in intelligence can't understand.
[00:36:44.801 --> 00:36:46.482]  It's just a historical fact.
[00:36:46.482 --> 00:36:52.646]  Our government went through Prussian-German intelligence with British, Dutch, and U.S.
[00:36:52.646 --> 00:36:55.147]  money and Rothschild money publicly.
[00:36:56.212 --> 00:37:20.169]  Took this young corporal, this intelligence chief who was spying on Germans, after the war, hired him, he took over this weird workers party, he used the swastika as its symbol, he got Skull and Bones funding, the Thule Society, and he took over Germany with billions of dollars of funding from the West.
[00:37:22.122 --> 00:37:45.844]  And he was never meant to win, he was meant to carry out his operation, then to make mistakes in the end, to lose, and then all of the double agents, all the Nazis that really worked for OSS were brought right back here to the US and England to help start setting up the same system and to take all the tens of billions of dollars from people they robbed in Europe, all the art
[00:37:46.865 --> 00:37:53.831]  Cashes, all the gold, all the diamonds, I mean just giant crane loads of gold and diamonds.
[00:37:53.831 --> 00:37:55.892]  That was all taken here to the U.S.
[00:37:55.892 --> 00:38:04.599]  and England and used by the shadow government to start the drug dealing, to start the CIA, to start that, to build that up.
[00:38:04.599 --> 00:38:08.341]  They simultaneously were building up the Russians and then gave them the bomb.
[00:38:08.341 --> 00:38:10.383]  They admit now they put Mao into power.
[00:38:11.663 --> 00:38:18.705]  I've seen the old CIA section chief a couple years ago on the History Channel admit they actually put Mao in and weren't for the Nationalists.
[00:38:18.705 --> 00:38:20.386]  They put Ho Chi Minh in.
[00:38:20.386 --> 00:38:25.247]  They called Fidel Castro the Abraham Lincoln of the Caribbean.
[00:38:25.247 --> 00:38:27.328]  They put all these guys in.
[00:38:27.328 --> 00:38:31.849]  Eighteen-year-old assassin Saddam Hussein, 1954, admitted.
[00:38:31.849 --> 00:38:34.350]  Put into power in 1979.
[00:38:34.350 --> 00:38:35.670]  Told to attack Iran.
[00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:36.830]  Told to attack Kuwait.
[00:38:36.830 --> 00:38:39.231]  When he followed orders the second time, they came in and
[00:38:41.038 --> 00:38:45.100]  Took his army out and then 12 years later took him out.
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:47.541]  They do this over and over and over again.
[00:38:47.541 --> 00:39:00.787]  In Afghanistan, they flew out 8,000 Taliban and Al-Qaeda leaders, this is admitted, flew them out to safety, grabbed a bunch of goat herders and shoemakers, people who'd done nothing, and took them to Camp X-Ray to train you how to torture.
[00:39:00.787 --> 00:39:02.268]  Train you that torture was okay.
[00:39:02.839 --> 00:39:04.460]  They do this over and over.
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:06.281]  This is how they bring countries down.
[00:39:06.281 --> 00:39:08.082]  This is how they bring regions down.
[00:39:08.082 --> 00:39:13.606]  This is how they bring us into World War where they consolidate their power.
[00:39:13.606 --> 00:39:21.611]  So again, if you want to grasp this, get the children's movie, Star Wars 2, Attack of the Clones.
[00:39:21.611 --> 00:39:28.475]  I'm not being condescending or sardonic, but it's so simple some people just can't seem to understand it.
[00:39:29.438 --> 00:39:32.401]  And this is the facts of what's going on.
[00:39:32.401 --> 00:39:52.678]  Alright, investigative journalist, award-winning reporter, John Buchanan, continuing, we're up to the 60s and 70s as they're still doing Nazi dealings, shredding documents, the Bushes and others, Nazis, Reinhard and Barbie and others found the CIA, they're protected publicly, please continue.
[00:39:53.058 --> 00:40:05.805]  Okay, now there's a very explosive new book out that your listeners need to be aware of, and you need to post on your website, because it has been spiked and covered up, and it was a much-anticipated book.
[00:40:05.805 --> 00:40:14.489]  The title of the book is Prelude to Terror, and it's by a noted intelligence expert, an author named Joseph J. Trento.
[00:40:14.489 --> 00:40:16.670]  T-R-E-N-T-O.
[00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:17.631]  And this is probably
[00:40:18.331 --> 00:40:24.816]  The most important topic we're going to ever talk about, Alex, when it goes to the question of how 9-1-1 happened.
[00:40:24.816 --> 00:40:35.384]  In the mid-1970s, when Daddy Bush became the director of the CIA, he had already, as you said, in Texas, been known to associate with Nazis.
[00:40:35.384 --> 00:40:38.046]  Nazis worked in his congressional campaign successfully.
[00:40:38.046 --> 00:40:38.706]  We're good to go.
[00:41:03.536 --> 00:41:10.619]  Because of his lust for power and blood money, they engineered the October Surprise out of the Iran-Contra scandal.
[00:41:10.619 --> 00:41:14.241]  I'm sure you and many of your listeners know this name.
[00:41:14.241 --> 00:41:25.546]  The network within the CIA that included Nazis was headed by a very well-known rogue CIA agent and criminal and drug dealer named Ted Shackley.
[00:41:25.546 --> 00:41:31.489]  Ted Shackley engineered the October Surprise, got Ronald Reagan elected, got Carter dumped,
[00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:35.593]  Now they're in the highest levels of power.
[00:41:35.593 --> 00:41:44.161]  In 1982, John Loftus, who had been working as a very reputable and honorable Nazi war crimes prosecutor at the U.S.
[00:41:44.161 --> 00:41:49.887]  Justice Department, broke the story of Nazis in high-ranking jobs in the U.S.
[00:41:49.887 --> 00:41:52.149]  government, including the White House.
[00:41:53.330 --> 00:42:00.116]  60 Minutes did that story in 1982 and it won an Emmy Award for News Reporting.
[00:42:00.116 --> 00:42:09.904]  That's how John Loftus went backwards from that point on and got on the story of the Bush-Nazi connection and their connection to the Holocaust.
[00:42:09.904 --> 00:42:15.069]  And he wrote a famous book in the early 1990s called The Secret War Against the Jews.
[00:42:15.649 --> 00:42:20.473]  His book is extremely well documented as well.
[00:42:20.473 --> 00:42:30.981]  So until the early to mid-1980s, it's well documented now that because of Daddy Bush, there were Nazi war criminals working in the U.S.
[00:42:30.981 --> 00:42:34.444]  government for salaries paid by U.S.
[00:42:34.444 --> 00:42:35.805]  tax dollars.
[00:42:35.805 --> 00:42:37.046]  Now we get to the problem.
[00:42:37.786 --> 00:42:55.879]  The question is, why didn't the New York Times, Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, Associated Press, UPI, Time Magazine, Newsweek Magazine, and the three networks all get on that story in a feeding frenzy like they did against Nixon when the Watergate tapes turned up?
[00:42:55.879 --> 00:43:04.605]  And the answer to that question you know very well, to go back to the Star Wars analogy to an extent, which is, you can't screw with Darth Vader.
[00:43:04.605 --> 00:43:05.466]  It's very hard.
[00:43:05.626 --> 00:43:23.532]  The Bush family is Darth Vader of the 20th and 21st centuries, and Darth gets taken down in the end of the movie, but it remains to be seen whether we the people can take down the Bush family and the Nazis before it's too late, because you and I both know what's coming up before the election.
[00:43:23.532 --> 00:43:33.035]  There's going to be some kind of terrorist incident, they're going to declare martial law, they're going to suspend the Constitution, and to your listeners who have never heard me before,
[00:43:33.815 --> 00:43:48.668]  And to the younger listeners that you referenced, maybe I sound like a nutcase, maybe I sound like a paranoid, maybe it's absurd to some of your new listeners to think some guy is claiming there's going to be a terrorist attack and they're going to take down the Constitution.
[00:43:48.668 --> 00:43:59.438]  Well, lo and behold, I now have in my possession from the Library of Congress on August the 10th, congressional testimony before the McCormick-Dickstein Committee of the U.S.
[00:43:59.438 --> 00:44:00.619]  House of Representatives
[00:44:01.039 --> 00:44:03.940]  And they were going to do exactly that in November of 1934.
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:11.141]  Prescott Bush led a group called the American Liberty League in treasonous conspiracy with J.P.
[00:44:11.141 --> 00:44:13.262]  Morgan and the DuPont family.
[00:44:13.262 --> 00:44:15.382]  He tried to overthrow the U.S.
[00:44:15.382 --> 00:44:16.122]  government.
[00:44:16.122 --> 00:44:17.263]  I've got the documents.
[00:44:17.263 --> 00:44:24.404]  They were going to abolish the presidency, make it a civil position, which was a dictatorship, and they were going to kill FDR.
[00:44:24.404 --> 00:44:26.965]  One of the transcripts that I have
[00:44:27.745 --> 00:44:33.526]  And I would even be happy to read some of it on the air now.
[00:44:33.526 --> 00:44:39.848]  They talked about Hitler being right, and that because the Communists were such a threat to the U.S.
[00:44:39.848 --> 00:44:55.671]  that they were going to have to start rounding up unruly, unemployed people from the Depression and uncooperative World War I veterans who wanted the bonus they had been promised by Herbert Hoover and never got, and put them into internment camps.
[00:44:55.691 --> 00:45:18.944]  Clearly, this anti-Commie rhetoric is so their low-level agents think they're involved in some type of good fight, and we just see this over and over again, and whether they pull a staged attack before the election, which former CIA agent, Chief Advisor to Ronald Reagan, is now saying, Ray McGovern, quote, there might be a real or staged terrorist attack in order to postpone the elections, McGovern said,
[00:45:19.924 --> 00:45:25.089]  Now that was last week to a large university crowd in Florida.
[00:45:25.089 --> 00:45:29.273]  So more and more people are saying this, or whether it comes after the election.
[00:45:29.273 --> 00:45:33.197]  Regardless, they are setting it up to pull something like this.
[00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:37.361]  A old dog doesn't learn new tricks, folks.
[00:45:37.361 --> 00:45:40.304]  It's the same thing over and over and over again.
[00:45:40.304 --> 00:45:41.045]  We'll be right back.
[00:45:45.413 --> 00:45:46.775]  The War on Terrorism.
[00:45:46.775 --> 00:45:49.839]  Will it be fought overseas or will it affect us here at home?
[00:45:49.839 --> 00:45:54.425]  If you are like most folks, you want to be prepared, but can't afford an underground shelter.
[00:45:54.425 --> 00:45:55.246]  So what do you do?
[00:45:55.246 --> 00:46:00.153]  Did you know that you can use your home as a shelter against fallout and biological or chemical attacks?
[00:46:00.613 --> 00:46:03.236]  With a little know-how, it's not that difficult.
[00:46:03.236 --> 00:46:04.537]  Sheltering in Place.
[00:46:04.537 --> 00:46:08.561]  Surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout.
[00:46:08.561 --> 00:46:17.989]  Developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.

[00:46:51.702 --> 00:46:56.063]  Inhaling exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[00:46:56.063 --> 00:47:00.624]  Also, may be irritating to the skin and mucous membranes and cause you to seek medical help.

[00:48:51.443 --> 00:48:55.907]  Hundreds of people report improved health and wellness using Rife frequency technology.
[00:48:55.907 --> 00:49:03.313]  In the 1920s, research scientist Royal Raymond Rife discovered that disease organisms can be destroyed using resonant frequencies.
[00:49:03.313 --> 00:49:09.578]  The BioSolutions frequency instrument uses the same technology for relief or elimination of pain and disease conditions.
[00:49:09.578 --> 00:49:10.799]  There are no side effects.
[00:49:11.119 --> 00:49:14.220]  Join others in discovering a return to natural health and wellness.
[00:49:14.220 --> 00:49:16.561]  Eliminate the cost, don't just treat symptoms.

[00:49:31.367 --> 00:49:32.368]  One more time, that's 866-885-6625.
[00:49:32.368 --> 00:49:32.668]  Call today.
[00:49:32.668 --> 00:49:34.129]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:49:34.129 --> 00:49:35.870]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:49:56.753 --> 00:49:59.975]  I normally take calls early in the first hour.
[00:49:59.975 --> 00:50:01.776]  I'm sorry we haven't gone to calls yet.
[00:50:01.776 --> 00:50:06.159]  Your calls are coming up in the next segment, but this is all so important, we've got to go over it.
[00:50:06.159 --> 00:50:09.481]  This is who's running our society, our planet.
[00:50:09.481 --> 00:50:12.542]  And the Bushes are just high-level minions in all of this.
[00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:14.163]  You know, John Buchanan is stunned.
[00:50:14.163 --> 00:50:21.228]  He says, you know, Newsweek, Time, New York Times, they all have it, but they don't report on it.
[00:50:21.228 --> 00:50:25.050]  I mean, they've got the mainstream news articles from the 40s saying this, but they don't report on it.
[00:50:27.026 --> 00:50:27.767]  Why is that?
[00:50:27.767 --> 00:50:32.072]  Well, I mean, look at Arnold Schwarzenegger saying he loves Hitler, wants to be like Hitler.
[00:50:32.072 --> 00:50:34.775]  He doesn't care if Kurt Voltheim's a Nazi.
[00:50:34.775 --> 00:50:37.939]  He loves him and is going to go campaign for him.
[00:50:37.939 --> 00:50:41.543]  And look again, the UN having Kurt Voltheim when he's a known Nazi.
[00:50:41.543 --> 00:50:43.385]  It's the whole system.
[00:50:43.385 --> 00:50:45.928]  And the Nazis are highly respected by the New World Order.
[00:50:45.928 --> 00:50:46.769]  They're beloved.
[00:50:48.070 --> 00:50:54.134]  They were put in key positions and are still in key positions, and their children and grandchildren are in key positions today.
[00:50:54.134 --> 00:51:01.998]  Arnold can go to a bodybuilding contest and say that he hates black people and scream the N-word, but there's a news blackout on that even though it's admitted.
[00:51:01.998 --> 00:51:10.463]  Arnold can do all of this because he is above analysis, above criticism, because he's part of this nest.
[00:51:11.292 --> 00:51:25.906]  And now he's positioned as a keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention, the head of the fifth largest economy in the world, and they've got bills openly introduced so he can be president to repeal the 22nd Amendment.
[00:51:25.906 --> 00:51:34.915]  So that's another case point example of this Nazi vein running from end to end throughout the government.
[00:51:34.915 --> 00:51:35.556]  John Buchanan?
[00:51:37.041 --> 00:51:46.448]  Thanks, and I'd like to make a critical point there that I would like your listeners from all walks of life that you have to listen to with an open mind.
[00:51:46.448 --> 00:51:53.553]  And that is when you get right down to it and you think about the world of today in the United States,
[00:51:54.454 --> 00:51:58.118]  What was Nazism and what was it all about?
[00:51:58.118 --> 00:52:12.433]  And if you ask me, Alex, all it came down to when you take away all the horror and the Holocaust and everything else is that a particular group of people felt superior to everyone else and they felt or they were convinced
[00:52:13.294 --> 00:52:33.139]  by a leader, that because the country was under threat from the communists and the terrorists, etc., that it was okay to suspend habeas corpus, suspend laws, put the brown shirts in, start beating people up, start incarcerating people, and ultimately start executing people.
[00:52:33.139 --> 00:52:41.461]  Now, that said, I'd like your listeners to keep an open mind and take a deep breath, because I'm going to read directly from the congressional testimony two statements.
[00:52:42.902 --> 00:52:49.847]  French testified that McGuire stated quote, we need a fascist government in this country to save the nation from the communists.
[00:53:01.317 --> 00:53:06.859]  Who want to tear it down and wreck all that we have built in America.
[00:53:06.859 --> 00:53:15.102]  The only men who have patriotism to do it are the soldiers, and General Smedley Butler is the ideal leader, etc.
[00:53:15.102 --> 00:53:24.346]  In another section, a journalist who brought the plot down, his name was Paul Comley French, an American hero who nobody's ever heard of, who testified before the committee.
[00:53:24.346 --> 00:53:27.747]  He wrote at the time for the New York Post and the Philadelphia Record.
[00:53:27.747 --> 00:53:28.808]  So this is Mr. French.
[00:53:30.048 --> 00:53:31.529]  And he had talked to the plotters.
[00:53:31.529 --> 00:53:43.393]  They were so arrogant, Alex, they were so drunk with their own power after bringing Hitler to power, which had just happened, that they talked to this reporter on the record, Mr. French.
[00:53:43.393 --> 00:53:46.094]  That is precisely the impression I gained from him.
[00:53:46.694 --> 00:53:50.936]  He had a very brilliant solution of the unemployment situation.
[00:53:50.936 --> 00:53:55.779]  He said that Roosevelt had muffed it terrifically, but that he had the plan.
[00:53:55.779 --> 00:53:57.540]  He had seen it in Europe.
[00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:05.164]  It was a plan that Hitler had used in putting all of the unemployed in labor camps or barracks for enforced labor.
[00:54:05.164 --> 00:54:10.386]  That would solve it overnight, and he said that when they got into power, that is what they would do.
[00:54:10.386 --> 00:54:12.627]  That was the ideal plan.
[00:54:12.627 --> 00:54:13.568]  Hitler was right.
[00:54:14.268 --> 00:54:16.650]  So you're reporting earlier on the national identity.
[00:54:16.650 --> 00:54:17.550]  He goes on.
[00:54:17.550 --> 00:54:23.734]  He had another suggestion to register all persons all over the country like they do in Europe.
[00:54:23.734 --> 00:54:29.618]  He said that would stop a lot of these communist agitators who were running around the country.
[00:54:29.618 --> 00:54:31.339]  They'd know who the people were.
[00:54:31.339 --> 00:54:33.120]  They'd know who were making the trouble.
[00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:36.983]  They'd know who were trying to overthrow the government and they'd go get them.
[00:54:37.723 --> 00:54:43.126]  Now, I hope your listeners, Alex, are chilled to the bone by hearing that.
[00:54:43.126 --> 00:54:48.549]  That is from the McCormick-Dickstein Committee of November 29th, 1934.
[00:54:48.549 --> 00:55:01.236]  Secretly convened in New York City, McCormick went on to become Speaker of the House and be another uncredited American hero, one of the few bona fide heroes ever in Congress that's in a dustbin of history.
[00:55:02.196 --> 00:55:08.300]  Let me stop you and add this, and again, meanwhile, they were funding all the communists at the very same time.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:08.740]  Correct.
[00:55:08.740 --> 00:55:11.302]  They were funding Mussolini, Stalin, you got it.
[00:55:11.302 --> 00:55:15.905]  And then they would tell the low-level generals and colonels, men, we've got to stop the commies.
[00:55:15.905 --> 00:55:18.486]  We've got to take everybody's rights, just like today.
[00:55:18.486 --> 00:55:18.786]  Correct.
[00:55:18.786 --> 00:55:21.808]  We've got to take everybody's rights to stop Al-Qaeda.
[00:55:21.808 --> 00:55:25.410]  Meanwhile, it's really Al-C-I-A-D-A.
[00:55:25.410 --> 00:55:26.491]  Are you starting to get this?
[00:55:26.491 --> 00:55:29.093]  We'll come back, cover a little bit more on this, uh,
[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:34.062]  Incredible story and then start taking your calls.
[00:55:34.062 --> 00:55:35.482]  We're on the march.
[00:55:35.482 --> 00:55:37.143]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:55:37.143 --> 00:55:43.846]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:55:43.846 --> 00:55:47.487]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[00:55:47.487 --> 00:55:49.268]  I've tried many, many products.
[00:55:49.268 --> 00:55:52.009]  I have never experienced anything like Collagenated.
[00:55:52.009 --> 00:55:55.791]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than eight weeks.
[00:55:56.258 --> 00:55:57.279]  It truly works.
[00:55:57.279 --> 00:55:58.901]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[00:55:58.901 --> 00:56:04.947]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[00:56:04.947 --> 00:56:10.994]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[00:56:11.434 --> 00:56:15.799]  Our listeners keep telling us BIM and VIGOR's Collagenate really does work.
[00:56:15.799 --> 00:56:17.240]  It's healthy for you too.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:25.168]  In addition to helping you lose weight, Collagenate is also designed to improve strength and health of muscles, joints, skin, hair and nails.
[00:56:25.168 --> 00:56:27.451]  So take Collagenate and rejuvenate.
[00:56:27.451 --> 00:56:28.552]  Call BIM and VIGOR today.
[00:56:28.552 --> 00:56:28.872]  1-800-622-FIN.
[00:56:28.872 --> 00:56:29.072]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[00:56:33.997 --> 00:56:37.518]  And listen, get $25 off the 3 month supply of Collagenate.

[00:56:40.679 --> 00:56:44.001]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[00:56:44.001 --> 00:56:47.322]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[00:56:47.322 --> 00:56:52.503]  And did you know that you can have greater exposure to these chemicals by taking hot showers than when you drink the water?
[00:56:52.503 --> 00:56:56.765]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed through the skin.
[00:56:57.145 --> 00:57:06.269]  The KDF Shower Filter is designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus in your shower.
[00:57:06.269 --> 00:57:10.191]  The media is non-toxic, environmentally sound, and is recyclable.
[00:57:10.191 --> 00:57:15.533]  The KDF Shower Filter will typically last 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[00:57:15.533 --> 00:57:22.717]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals, and bacteria.
[00:57:22.717 --> 00:57:23.277]  What about you?
[00:57:24.017 --> 00:57:29.441]  Order your KDF shower filter, normally $49, for our special price of only $35, a $14 savings.

[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.141]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[00:57:46.141 --> 00:57:53.787]  Jerry Guidetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[00:57:53.787 --> 00:57:58.470]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[00:57:58.470 --> 00:58:08.298]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[00:58:08.698 --> 00:58:09.899]  We're good to go.
[00:58:27.048 --> 00:58:31.390]  Every year, call them today at 800-255-1912.
[00:58:31.390 --> 00:58:32.050]  That's 800-255-1912.
[00:58:32.050 --> 00:58:38.793]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[00:58:38.793 --> 00:58:39.853]  It's powerful stuff.
[00:58:39.853 --> 00:58:52.598]  Alright, Mike and KC and Ruth and Clint and Mike and others, your calls are coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:58:52.598 --> 00:58:53.899]  John Buchanan joins us.
[00:58:54.793 --> 00:58:58.076]  Who knows, we might just keep John Withers in the next hour if he can do it.
[00:58:58.076 --> 00:59:06.223]  Before we go back to John Buchanan, just briefly here, a lot of people hear this radio show, read a transcript of this broadcast, they have trouble believing it.
[00:59:06.966 --> 00:59:16.771]  That's why we post subsections on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com with all the documents, news articles, reports backing up our claims.
[00:59:16.771 --> 00:59:25.635]  We do real journalism, not just a bibliography or footnotes, but living live links to the source of documentation.
[00:59:25.635 --> 00:59:36.481]  And that's why the alternative media is gaining all the credibility, the mainstream media is losing their credibility, and that's why the globalists are moving to regulate and tax and control the internet.
[00:59:37.765 --> 00:59:39.849]  We've got an in-run around that though.
[00:59:39.849 --> 00:59:44.858]  You can tell your friends, your neighbors, total strangers about this radio show.
[00:59:44.858 --> 00:59:48.906]  Whether you're listening on a local AM or FM station, that's really easy.
[00:59:48.906 --> 00:59:50.349]  Point them to that local frequency.
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:57.344]  Or, if you're listening on satellite, shortwave, or internet, tell folks about the different ways to listen to this broadcast.
[00:59:57.344 --> 01:00:01.066]  We're growing by leaps and bounds, but not fast enough.
[01:00:01.066 --> 01:00:14.995]  The pleasure of my life, what I relish, what I love, is exposing evil, because I realize I'm not safe, my family's not safe, your family's not safe, if we don't stand up against these degenerate control freak bullies.
[01:00:14.995 --> 01:00:17.296]  And that's putting it lightly.
[01:00:17.296 --> 01:00:18.657]  I have made 11 films.
[01:00:18.657 --> 01:00:20.078]  The 11th film is now out.
[01:00:20.778 --> 01:00:24.240]  It is American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004.
[01:00:24.240 --> 01:00:30.903]  It covers Skull and Bones, Bush, Kerry being cousins, what their program is, how they're almost identical.
[01:00:30.903 --> 01:00:33.504]  It is a new, great film, 90 minutes long, $19.95.
[01:00:33.504 --> 01:00:35.925]  I've got 10 other films.
[01:00:35.925 --> 01:00:37.726]  They're all 2 hours 5 minutes, 2 hours 44 minutes long.
[01:00:37.726 --> 01:00:40.767]  They're $25.95, $20 if you order 3 of those original 10 films.
[01:00:46.582 --> 01:00:47.582]  Also, I've written a book.
[01:00:47.582 --> 01:00:48.663]  I've published another book.
[01:00:48.663 --> 01:00:51.603]  Both those books are on 9-11 and government-sponsored terror.
[01:00:51.603 --> 01:00:53.124]  Two of my films are about 9-11.
[01:00:53.124 --> 01:00:55.525]  9-11, The Road to Tyranny, and The Masters of Terror.
[01:00:55.525 --> 01:00:59.886]  I also carry Eric Huffman's video and book as well.
[01:00:59.886 --> 01:01:03.087]  9-11 Painful Questions, 9-11 Painful Deceptions.
[01:01:03.087 --> 01:01:04.067]  Both of them are excellent.
[01:01:04.067 --> 01:01:06.868]  George Humphrey's new 9-11 video that comes with a free book.
[01:01:07.928 --> 01:01:11.170]  9-11, The Great Illusion, Endgame of the Illuminati.
[01:01:11.170 --> 01:01:14.972]  Get these, show them to people, get the word out today.
[01:01:14.972 --> 01:01:18.674]  The toll free number to get my films or to ask about the different specials 1-888-9111.
[01:01:22.176 --> 01:01:31.399]  2-5-3-3-1-3-9 that's 888-253-3139 or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704 or via the safe secure online shopping carts again at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com
[01:01:46.724 --> 01:01:51.586]  Get your videos and books today and start in the info war now, my friends.
[01:01:51.586 --> 01:01:53.606]  Circumvent the mainstream media.
[01:01:53.606 --> 01:01:57.868]  We've just got to tell somebody the truth one time and a lot of them wake up.
[01:01:57.868 --> 01:02:02.389]  The globalists have to keep reapplying their lies over and over again.
[01:02:02.389 --> 01:02:04.130]  All the big polls are out.
[01:02:04.130 --> 01:02:06.230]  The government has less credibility than ever.
[01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:07.971]  People know the truth.
[01:02:07.971 --> 01:02:09.731]  They just don't have all the details.
[01:02:09.731 --> 01:02:12.052]  We've got to give them those details.
[01:02:12.052 --> 01:02:13.953]  We've got a responsibility.
[01:02:13.953 --> 01:02:14.113]  Now,
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.781]  Look at America.
[01:02:16.781 --> 01:02:21.784]  Look at the police state, the national ID card in this new bill.
[01:02:21.784 --> 01:02:25.126]  Patriot Act II in this new bill they've introduced.
[01:02:25.126 --> 01:02:31.189]  Open discussions of putting people in camps who disagreed with the government by Michael Weiner, known as Michael Savage.
[01:02:31.189 --> 01:02:34.911]  By Michelle Malkin, well, you know, camps might be needed.
[01:02:34.911 --> 01:02:39.134]  All of this atmosphere, this backdrop there, it's really happening.
[01:02:39.134 --> 01:02:40.715]  Seven million people in prison.
[01:02:41.375 --> 01:02:44.156]  Up from 1.3 million just nine years ago.
[01:02:44.156 --> 01:02:46.297]  They're saying they'll soon be 30 million in prison.
[01:02:46.297 --> 01:02:47.717]  They're building more prisons.
[01:02:47.717 --> 01:02:59.161]  The economy is shifting towards this command and control total police state owned by the terrorists, owned by the drug dealers, owned by the criminals.
[01:02:59.161 --> 01:03:03.882]  And if we don't face this horror and stand up against it, it's only going to get worse.
[01:03:03.882 --> 01:03:05.643]  We've got a fighting chance.
[01:03:06.773 --> 01:03:09.915]  John Buchanan, any other comments before we go to these calls?
[01:03:09.915 --> 01:03:26.342]  Yeah, but before you go to the calls, Alex, I'd like to read one section from the McCormick-Dickstein Committee, and again, I would like your listeners, and I would like you, and I would like every Christian out there especially, since you invoke your Christianity often, and I am the grandson of a Methodist minister.
[01:03:26.342 --> 01:03:30.384]  I'm going to read one more section, and then I'd like your listeners to call in.
[01:03:30.384 --> 01:03:32.785]  But first, let me ask you this.
[01:03:32.785 --> 01:03:35.507]  You said you're going to mail me these documents today, John?
[01:03:35.507 --> 01:03:35.687]  Yes.
[01:03:36.593 --> 01:03:38.634]  So as soon as you're off the air, you're going to mail me these documents?
[01:03:38.634 --> 01:03:39.334]  I'm going to send them in.
[01:03:39.334 --> 01:03:40.194]  You'll have them tomorrow.
[01:03:40.194 --> 01:03:41.015]  That's correct.
[01:03:41.015 --> 01:03:41.495]  Awesome.
[01:03:41.495 --> 01:03:45.076]  And again, 13-page article in the London Guardian.
[01:03:45.076 --> 01:03:46.997]  John told me about this three weeks ago.
[01:03:46.997 --> 01:03:49.798]  He's been in contact with them for months, feeding them the info.
[01:03:49.798 --> 01:03:53.139]  They went to the National Archives, got it for themselves.
[01:03:53.139 --> 01:03:53.799]  But go ahead.
[01:03:54.179 --> 01:04:03.869]  Okay, and will you bear in mind what I already read about rounding up troublemakers and putting them in internment camps and the national ID system that Hitler and Mussolini had used 70 years ago?
[01:04:03.869 --> 01:04:07.253]  I'm going to just read a short section and I'll look forward to the calls.
[01:04:07.253 --> 01:04:12.078]  This is Paul Conley, French again, the acclaimed journalist who broke the story and ended the coup with Smedley Butler.
[01:04:12.818 --> 01:04:32.128]  During the conversation, he, meaning McGuire again, during the conversation he told me he had been in Italy and Germany during the summer of 1934 and the spring of 1934 and had made an intensive study of the background of the Nazi and fascist movements and how the veterans had played a part in them.
[01:04:32.828 --> 01:04:41.556]  He said he had obtained enough information on the fascist and Nazi movements and the part played by the veterans to properly set up one in this country.
[01:04:41.556 --> 01:04:42.798]  Now here comes the punchline.
[01:04:42.798 --> 01:04:43.418]  Think today.
[01:04:43.418 --> 01:04:45.000]  Think George W. Bush.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.102]  Every speech out of his mouth.
[01:04:47.102 --> 01:04:55.349]  He emphasized throughout his conversation with me that the whole thing was tremendously patriotic.
[01:04:56.150 --> 01:05:06.995]  That it was saving the nation from communists, and that the men they deal with have that crack-brained idea that the communists are going to take it apart.
[01:05:06.995 --> 01:05:15.278]  If you substitute terrorists for communists, and you look at the tenets and symbols of fascism, like bunting, lapel pins,
[01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:18.280]  Patriotic speeches, etc.
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:20.441]  Alex, history is about to repeat itself.
[01:05:20.441 --> 01:05:30.567]  And if the families of young children in this country, like yourself, don't stand up right here, right now, before this election,
[01:05:31.207 --> 01:05:49.731]  The Constitution is going to be flushed down the toilet and you and I are going to be among the first people rounded up and put into FEMA camps and you and I talked about that in New York and you have young children and I don't so I fear more for you than I do for myself and your listeners need to get in every school classroom, every
[01:05:50.031 --> 01:05:50.391]  We're good.
[01:06:05.933 --> 01:06:07.054]  All right, let me just add this.
[01:06:07.054 --> 01:06:13.980]  They've got the election fixed either way with Kerry with the same, you know, connections leading back.
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:18.184]  But regardless, you may just raise the awareness so people know the real issues.
[01:06:18.184 --> 01:06:21.608]  And certainly, they've trained the National Guard, the State National Guard.
[01:06:22.228 --> 01:06:23.789]  All the different groups to do this.
[01:06:23.789 --> 01:06:25.330]  They're not going to get away with it.
[01:06:25.330 --> 01:06:39.622]  I have the 1980 hearings with Oliver North in my film, The Takeover, where they go, Congressman Jack Brooks goes, Colonel North, we have your documents here and it's been in the Miami papers for plans for martial law to put people in camps.
[01:06:40.342 --> 01:06:44.706]  And the chairman goes, we will not talk about that now, that is executive session.
[01:06:44.706 --> 01:06:53.154]  They've been planning and wanting this for a long time, but I think they lack the political will now, without another giant terror attack.
[01:06:53.154 --> 01:06:59.379]  And now with polls showing that half of New Yorkers think the government was behind 9-11, I don't think they're going to get away with it.
[01:06:59.379 --> 01:07:02.642]  I think they're going to continually pull this incremental march.
[01:07:02.642 --> 01:07:05.705]  Because we are standing up, because we are fighting.
[01:07:05.945 --> 01:07:09.326]  Correct, but since the media, you mentioned the Zogby Poll.
[01:07:09.326 --> 01:07:13.388]  I was in New York the opening night of the convention when the Zogby Poll came out.
[01:07:13.388 --> 01:07:22.652]  And not only did the media spike the Zogby Poll, but we were not able to get one single member of the U.S.
[01:07:22.652 --> 01:07:25.573]  Congress to speak out about it.
[01:07:25.573 --> 01:07:26.633]  I'm going to take some calls.
[01:07:26.633 --> 01:07:28.814]  I want to thank the callers for holding forever.
[01:07:28.814 --> 01:07:30.355]  Mike in Illinois, you're on the air.
[01:07:30.355 --> 01:07:30.935]  Go ahead.
[01:07:30.935 --> 01:07:32.956]  Yeah, hi Alex and hello to your guests.
[01:07:32.956 --> 01:07:33.776]  I just want to thank you.
[01:07:36.843 --> 01:07:37.564]  Yes, go ahead.
[01:07:37.564 --> 01:07:38.024]  Oh, I didn't hear.
[01:07:38.024 --> 01:07:38.524]  I heard something.
[01:07:38.524 --> 01:07:38.744]  Sorry.
[01:07:38.744 --> 01:07:40.585]  I think that's John's phone, but go ahead.
[01:07:40.585 --> 01:07:41.165]  Oh, okay.
[01:07:41.165 --> 01:07:43.186]  Alex, I want to ask you.
[01:07:43.186 --> 01:07:46.787]  There's a statement I want to make, and I want to ask you a question, Alex.
[01:07:46.787 --> 01:07:52.170]  I badmouthed Bush about a month on your airwaves, and I had to apologize because I said something about his head coming off, too.
[01:07:52.170 --> 01:08:01.214]  It's horrible to say that about anybody because I'm a Christian, and you don't want to wish it upon anybody, but Alex, you always refer to them, well, they're just puppets, but Alex, let me ask you a question.
[01:08:01.214 --> 01:08:03.134]  Bush- KC, you're on the air.
[01:08:03.134 --> 01:08:04.315]  Where are you calling from, KC?
[01:08:05.356 --> 01:08:06.917]  Hi, good afternoon, Alex.
[01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:08.218]  Yes, where are you calling from?
[01:08:08.218 --> 01:08:08.939]  New York.
[01:08:08.939 --> 01:08:09.700]  Welcome.
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:10.400]  Welcome.
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:17.947]  Um, I didn't talk to you previously about some things, and, um, I had called in before I knew that John Buchanan was going to be on here.
[01:08:17.947 --> 01:08:19.288]  That's fine, go ahead, ma'am.
[01:08:19.288 --> 01:08:22.390]  Um, I wanted to tell you about something that happened this weekend.
[01:08:22.390 --> 01:08:28.756]  Um, my daughter goes to a private Christian school, and we had a harvest festival that we have every year.
[01:08:28.756 --> 01:08:31.398]  Um, the state police were there fingerprinting
[01:08:32.372 --> 01:08:36.135]  The children, which is not new.
[01:08:36.135 --> 01:08:41.499]  All over the country they claim it's so they don't get kidnapped, but it's really going into giant databases.
[01:08:41.499 --> 01:08:42.880]  That's exactly it.
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:46.343]  We used to be able to take these fingerprint cards home.
[01:08:46.343 --> 01:08:50.686]  And this year, the cop was like, no, they're going into our files.
[01:08:50.686 --> 01:08:56.470]  Ma'am, coast to coast, they're doing DNA swabs of their cheek tissue out of their mouths.
[01:08:56.470 --> 01:08:57.171]  Did you say no?
[01:08:58.767 --> 01:09:00.187]  I wouldn't let her be fingerprinted.
[01:09:00.187 --> 01:09:01.788]  I wouldn't let them near her.
[01:09:01.788 --> 01:09:07.169]  I was talking to one of the class mothers and I said to them, I'm trying to get out of this system.
[01:09:07.169 --> 01:09:08.230]  I'm not going to let my kids be fingerprinted.
[01:09:08.230 --> 01:09:13.151]  Yeah, this is for the National ID card and it's going to be biometrically accessed at every point of sale.
[01:09:13.151 --> 01:09:14.551]  Well, I'm not dowying that either.
[01:09:14.551 --> 01:09:17.732]  I mean, if it takes driving without a license, then so be it.
[01:09:17.732 --> 01:09:19.273]  I'm not going to go along with it.
[01:09:19.273 --> 01:09:20.773]  And I told them, I said that to them.
[01:09:21.320 --> 01:09:25.564]  And the problem that I have here is trying to educate these people.
[01:09:25.564 --> 01:09:34.952]  Well, here's the Associated Press saying that the driver's license is the national ID card.
[01:09:34.952 --> 01:09:37.735]  So if they don't understand that, I'm sorry.
[01:09:37.735 --> 01:09:38.355]  Oh, I know that.
[01:09:38.355 --> 01:09:42.139]  And I have a friend who tried to go to the bank and cash a check.
[01:09:42.139 --> 01:09:44.541]  They wouldn't let her cash it because her license is incurrent.
[01:09:44.966 --> 01:09:47.047]  And she said, well, it's still my driver's license.
[01:09:47.047 --> 01:09:50.268]  It just expired and I didn't get it renewed because I can't drive right now.
[01:09:50.268 --> 01:09:53.489]  But if she was an illegal alien, she'd get a red carpet treatment.
[01:09:53.489 --> 01:09:55.330]  John Buchanan, comments?
[01:09:55.330 --> 01:10:02.433]  Uh, Casey, first of all, I would like to commend you for not allowing the state police to fingerprint your child.
[01:10:02.433 --> 01:10:05.134]  And I would say what I said earlier, which I say in almost...
[01:10:05.954 --> 01:10:06.775]  We're good to go.
[01:10:21.221 --> 01:10:35.645]  Mosque, you name it, and rise up locally and find people that will form a national movement of parents, which Alex may know, but that already exist, that will prevent them from fingerprinting children for biometric identification.
[01:10:35.645 --> 01:10:46.187]  Because if you heard the documents I read before, they were talking about that in 1934 and citing Hitler as the example for doing that and it being wise social policy.
[01:10:46.187 --> 01:10:48.988]  And as Alex knows well and talks about every day,
[01:10:49.888 --> 01:11:15.733]  That only scratches the surface of what they intend to do with the FEMA detention camps and everything else, and like I said earlier, I mean, time is running out, Casey, and you have the burden of parenting young children, which I don't share, and I'm terrified of them, so if I'm terrified of them as an investigative reporter, I can only imagine how you feel, but again, I commend you for your courage in not allowing that to happen, and I hope you will form some kind of a New York parent group.
[01:11:16.033 --> 01:11:17.354]  KC, thank you for the call.
[01:11:17.354 --> 01:11:18.174]  I'll just say this.
[01:11:18.174 --> 01:11:21.815]  Because you do love your children, you fight the New World Order.
[01:11:21.815 --> 01:11:25.257]  This system is to come down upon everyone.
[01:11:25.257 --> 01:11:32.119]  Great and small, powerful and weak, the New World Order is about a criminal dehumanization and consolidation.
[01:11:32.119 --> 01:11:35.441]  Fighting it is the only way to be safer.
[01:11:35.441 --> 01:11:41.383]  We should all be terrified of not standing up against these wicked, evil globalists.
[01:11:41.903 --> 01:11:48.026]  We'll be back and we'll talk to Ruth and Clint and Mike and many many others on the other side of this quick break.
[01:11:48.026 --> 01:11:48.506]  1-800-259-9231.
[01:11:48.506 --> 01:11:55.949]  We've got a whole other hour and nine minutes coming up so you'll want to stay with us.
[01:11:55.949 --> 01:11:57.810]  A ton of other vital news as well.
[01:11:57.810 --> 01:12:00.712]  We'll get your take on it as well as John Buchanan's PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:08.375]  Alex Jones here, announcing the release of my new film, Police State 3 Total Enslavement.
[01:12:08.375 --> 01:12:12.941]  Police State 3 details the architecture, rules, and operations of the New World Order.
[01:12:12.941 --> 01:12:17.587]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[01:12:17.587 --> 01:12:18.728]  New World Order.
[01:12:19.549 --> 01:12:20.489]  Hammer.
[01:12:20.489 --> 01:12:24.771]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[01:12:24.771 --> 01:12:31.834]  We've ripped the Sinister Patriot Act legislation 1 and 2 apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[01:12:31.834 --> 01:12:34.235]  You will lose your liberty.
[01:12:34.235 --> 01:12:44.598]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grants, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[01:12:44.598 --> 01:12:46.459]  If you want to understand what the new world order
[01:12:46.459 --> 01:12:47.180]  It really is.
[01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:50.724]  But my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you.
[01:12:50.724 --> 01:12:54.669]  Visit InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com to order or call toll free 1-888-253-3139.
[01:12:54.669 --> 01:12:55.110]  That's 888-253-3139.
[01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:56.952]  Order today and spread the word.
[01:13:03.993 --> 01:13:07.337]  The Berkey Light is your premier source of purified water.
[01:13:07.337 --> 01:13:16.169]  It's portable and requires no water pressure, so you can enjoy healthy drinking water whether it's during normal times or hostile environments like a local or national emergency.
[01:13:16.169 --> 01:13:21.176]  That's because it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes and stagnant ponds.
[01:13:21.636 --> 01:13:28.742]  The Berkey Light is unique because it removes pathogenic bacteria, cyst parasites, and harmful chemicals to below detectable levels.
[01:13:28.742 --> 01:13:41.032]  It also removes foul taste and odors, like the rotten egg smell of sulfide, and it extracts nitrates and unhealthy minerals, like lead and mercury, while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:13:41.032 --> 01:13:45.655]  The Berkey Light's rechargeable LED lighting system is so bright, it can be used as a reading light.

[01:15:04.156 --> 01:15:09.720]  He's the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:15:12.196 --> 01:15:18.021]  Former CIA agent says Bush to blame for 9-11 possible staged terror attacks before the election.
[01:15:18.021 --> 01:15:24.727]  That's Ray McGovern, the chief analyst for Ronald Reagan, saying they may stage terror attacks.
[01:15:24.727 --> 01:15:26.448]  We're in martial law, my friends.
[01:15:26.448 --> 01:15:29.211]  It's what increment of that are we going to accept?
[01:15:29.211 --> 01:15:36.397]  And now the London Guardian, based on Mishap Buchanan's research and others, how Bush's grandfather helped Hitler's rise to power.
[01:15:37.369 --> 01:15:41.032]  And they love modern-day Nazis like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:15:41.032 --> 01:15:42.553]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[01:15:42.553 --> 01:15:43.353]  Let's talk to Ruth.
[01:15:43.353 --> 01:15:46.135]  Ruth, where are you calling us from today?
[01:15:46.135 --> 01:15:47.336]  Pittsburgh.
[01:15:47.336 --> 01:15:47.936]  Welcome.
[01:15:47.936 --> 01:15:48.997]  Hi, Mr. Buchanan.
[01:15:48.997 --> 01:15:52.720]  You wrote an article, didn't you, in a New England paper about this about last year or so?
[01:15:53.168 --> 01:15:56.152]  I wrote three last October and November in the New Hampshire Gazette.
[01:16:08.388 --> 01:16:14.493]  I'm not going to argue or I do have a disagreement with what you're saying but it's not about the facts about the Bush family.
[01:16:24.019 --> 01:16:33.561]  What I would take issue with after all this reading, and I was really shocked when I realized it from this reading, is that I don't believe that Hitler was a globalist.
[01:16:33.561 --> 01:16:38.483]  I believe he was an ultra-nationalist who was used by the global powers to bring Germany down.
[01:16:38.483 --> 01:16:40.383]  They had just brought Russia down.
[01:16:40.383 --> 01:16:44.124]  Germany was their next target because it was the biggest military power in Europe.
[01:16:44.124 --> 01:16:48.465]  And even Hitler himself says in Mein Kampf and his writings that they're going to go get America next.
[01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:57.989]  It's next on their list, and if you read everything Hitler wrote, he was arguing against the same sort of forces that these very programs on Genesis Radio argue against.
[01:16:57.989 --> 01:16:59.770]  He argues against the bankers.
[01:16:59.770 --> 01:17:04.051]  Ma'am, ma'am, thank you for the call, but that's about as much of that as I can handle.
[01:17:04.051 --> 01:17:10.714]  What the globalists do is, the Soviets, you read the Soviet writing, we're fighting the big banks, we're fighting the New World Order.
[01:17:10.714 --> 01:17:12.635]  Next speech, we are the New World Order.
[01:17:12.635 --> 01:17:15.236]  They were all created by the same people.
[01:17:15.236 --> 01:17:17.197]  You're being fooled by the dialectic, John.
[01:17:18.985 --> 01:17:28.335]  Well, I really am not an expert on Hitler and haven't read Mein Kampf, and that's one question I don't feel qualified to answer.
[01:17:28.335 --> 01:17:31.299]  Oh, he did have a bunch of anti-global statements.
[01:17:31.299 --> 01:17:35.103]  That's why he had to have his own New World Order to defeat the New World Order.
[01:17:36.983 --> 01:17:40.424]  Well, if I could say one thing to Ruth, the caller.
[01:17:40.424 --> 01:17:47.647]  Ruth, I'm going to be doing what's billed as the National Truth Tour beginning October 11th in New Hampshire.
[01:17:47.647 --> 01:17:49.348]  And I'm going to go out for the last three weeks
[01:17:51.291 --> 01:17:51.691]  I think.
[01:18:08.985 --> 01:18:13.227]  I was going to say, Mr. Buchanan mentioned that what he was saying might sound strange to some people.
[01:18:39.540 --> 01:18:43.723]  And had I heard this maybe two years ago, it would have sounded strange to me.
[01:18:43.723 --> 01:18:50.929]  But I found 9-1-1, Road to Tyranny, is an invaluable tool for educating people, and that's what changed my way of thinking.
[01:18:50.929 --> 01:19:05.821]  And the links between the Nazis and the Bushes that Buchanan is talking about, if you look at how the Patriot Acts come about in the state that this nation is now, it's a carbon copy of Hitler and the Reichstag.
[01:19:07.924 --> 01:19:11.106]  I also want to say that people are waking up.
[01:19:11.106 --> 01:19:24.677]  I went to a reenactment this weekend where my organization was raising funds and our biggest seller was a bumper sticker that had a battle flag on it that said Fighting Terrorism 1861 and we sold out of those in no time.
[01:19:26.249 --> 01:19:27.630]  Alright, well thank you for the call.
[01:19:27.630 --> 01:19:29.151]  Hey, maybe if I could make one comment, Alex?
[01:19:29.151 --> 01:19:31.372]  Sure.
[01:19:31.372 --> 01:19:44.279]  You're right on, and what you need to do in your community, and then reach out to friends you have in other communities, is to make people understand that 9-1-1 was Bush's Reichstag fire.
[01:19:44.279 --> 01:19:45.980]  There is no doubt about it.
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:48.061]  The two events were identical.
[01:19:48.061 --> 01:19:49.662]  The problem... We gotta break!
[01:19:49.662 --> 01:19:50.263]  Gotta break.
[01:19:50.263 --> 01:19:51.303]  Time waits for no man.
[01:19:51.303 --> 01:19:53.925]  We'll be back with a third hour.
[01:19:53.925 --> 01:19:54.465]  Hello, folk!
[01:20:01.868 --> 01:20:03.189]  Big Brother.
[01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:04.951]  Mainstream media.
[01:20:04.951 --> 01:20:06.713]  Government cover-ups.
[01:20:06.713 --> 01:20:08.275]  You want answers?
[01:20:08.275 --> 01:20:09.856]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:09.856 --> 01:20:14.041]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:20:14.041 --> 01:20:18.105]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:20:21.258 --> 01:20:24.820]  Alright, my friends, now into the third and final hour.
[01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:27.941]  Boy, you sure missed it in the last two hours.
[01:20:27.941 --> 01:20:28.981]  He's still with us, though.
[01:20:28.981 --> 01:20:32.043]  We're going to recap and get into some more detail.
[01:20:32.043 --> 01:20:34.384]  John Buchanan, investigative journalist, is with us.
[01:20:34.384 --> 01:20:35.804]  This is the London Guardian.
[01:20:35.804 --> 01:20:38.746]  He told me about this article three weeks ago, how it was going to be coming out.
[01:20:38.746 --> 01:20:40.226]  It did come out last Friday.
[01:20:40.226 --> 01:20:43.608]  How Bush's grandfather helped Hitler's rise to power.
[01:20:44.528 --> 01:21:06.714]  And they're now being sued by Auschwitz survivors for actually being shareholders in IG Farben and being intimately involved in it and then helping get Nazis out of the country, controlling their wealth up into the early 1950s and evidence is clear still today, using that to take over and create the CIA and take over intelligence agencies in this nation.
[01:21:06.714 --> 01:21:08.655]  Let's get some more of these callers we've been holding
[01:21:09.554 --> 01:21:14.997]  I agree that it's vitally important that people understand the Nazi links to the Bush family and historically what the Bushes have done.
[01:21:37.546 --> 01:21:43.012]  You know, I think General Smetley Butler was given a Hobson's choice back in the 30s.
[01:21:43.012 --> 01:21:54.503]  He could either lead the nation into fascism, or he could watch the nation be taken over by communists like FDR, and then die by a million cuts.
[01:21:54.503 --> 01:21:56.786]  So I'm not sure that we got the better end of that bargain.
[01:21:56.786 --> 01:21:57.747]  Well, let me stop you.
[01:21:57.747 --> 01:22:00.470]  For those that just joined us, we'll hold you over if need be, Mike.
[01:22:01.523 --> 01:22:11.675]  Uh, they've now gotten more National Archives documents from these hearings in 34, where the Bushes and others thought Smedley Butler would go with them for a coup d'etat.
[01:22:11.675 --> 01:22:16.020]  This Marine Corps officer, he later wrote a book, wore as a racket and went public
[01:22:16.540 --> 01:22:18.402]  And now these coup documents are open.
[01:22:18.402 --> 01:22:20.824]  In the 80's we learned of coups they planned.
[01:22:20.824 --> 01:22:23.987]  Now we're learning of new martial law coups.
[01:22:23.987 --> 01:22:30.233]  And the point is, is the very same people saying we've got to overthrow America to fight the commies, we're also funding the commies.
[01:22:30.233 --> 01:22:38.021]  These big international bankers fund anybody, as Professor Carl Quigley said, who will overthrow existing liberties and freedom.
[01:22:38.021 --> 01:22:38.642]  Go ahead, Mike.
[01:22:40.939 --> 01:22:43.021]  I think Ruth was essentially correct.
[01:22:43.021 --> 01:22:50.809]  You know, this satanic New World Order has picked off one Christian nation or empire after another from Russia, from France to Russia to...
[01:22:51.622 --> 01:22:52.222]  We're good to go.
[01:23:14.393 --> 01:23:16.935]  Well, that's the plan is World War III.
[01:23:16.935 --> 01:23:19.036]  They're getting ready to go into Iran and Syria.
[01:23:19.036 --> 01:23:22.258]  They're going to let China grab some countries while we're busy doing that.
[01:23:22.258 --> 01:23:24.200]  This will come after a terror attack.
[01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:25.901]  Then we'll have the national draft.
[01:23:25.901 --> 01:23:37.208]  But for Mr. Buchanan, you spoke earlier of John Loftus at Justice in almost reverential tones, and I think you need to do a little investigating there.
[01:23:37.208 --> 01:23:42.952]  My understanding is that he has led a death squad operating out of the Justice Department
[01:23:43.730 --> 01:23:54.882]  And with strong ties back to Israel that may have been responsible for the death of, I can't remember his name now, an Italian named freelance reporter down in Florida investigating
[01:23:59.183 --> 01:24:00.923]  You're talking about Danny Casolaro?
[01:24:00.923 --> 01:24:09.506]  I happen to be something of an expert on the Danny Casolaro case, apart from Mr. Loftus.
[01:24:09.506 --> 01:24:16.509]  And Mike, you're a caller into a radio program, and I hope that you'll take this comment in the spirit that it's offered.
[01:24:17.009 --> 01:24:40.272]  And that is that from your knowledge of things and your attention to programs like Alex Jones, if you could say that in 1934 the choice between FDR or a Hitler-type fascist state was up for grabs, and then you could buy into a vicious rumor like John Loftus would have anything to do with death squads,
[01:24:40.972 --> 01:24:45.174]  You've... I hate to be blunt, but you are a victim of brainwashing.
[01:24:45.174 --> 01:24:51.057]  Mr. Aloft just went to bat for me when I was under... I'll tell you what, let's debate this on the other side of the break.
[01:24:51.057 --> 01:24:53.038]  I want to give Mike a chance to respond.
[01:24:53.038 --> 01:24:53.858]  He'll be right back.
[01:24:53.858 --> 01:24:54.298]  Stay with us.
[01:24:54.298 --> 01:24:54.819]  PresidentPlanet.TV.
[01:24:57.336 --> 01:25:00.279]  Are you one of the millions who suffer from arthritis or chronic back pain?
[01:25:00.279 --> 01:25:01.240]  Michael Trudeau here.
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:04.723]  I speak from personal experience when I say living with either one isn't any fun.
[01:25:04.723 --> 01:25:10.529]  You see, a little over 20 years ago, I was involved in a car accident that injured some vertebrae and discs in my back.
[01:25:10.529 --> 01:25:13.552]  The damage led to degenerative arthritis in my upper back and neck.
[01:25:13.812 --> 01:25:18.276]  I tried physical therapy and chiropractors for years, usually with little or no positive results.
[01:25:18.276 --> 01:25:20.318]  The chronic everyday pain was miserable.
[01:25:20.318 --> 01:25:27.564]  Many friends offered advice on how to get relief, and I humored most, again with little or no success, until my friend Cliff Scott recommended his MSM.
[01:25:27.564 --> 01:25:30.347]  He said it was all natural and worked to relieve inflammation.
[01:25:30.347 --> 01:25:34.951]  Once again, albeit reluctantly, I took another friend's advice, only this time it changed my life.
[01:25:34.951 --> 01:25:38.814]  After six weeks, I noticed some improvement, and after 12 weeks, measurable improvement.
[01:25:38.914 --> 01:25:44.438]  Well, that was two years ago, and I've been taking MSM ever since, and today, my quality of life has improved dramatically.
[01:25:44.438 --> 01:25:45.139]  Side effects?
[01:25:45.139 --> 01:25:47.581]  Yeah, my knee used to bug me, and that's better now, too.
[01:25:47.581 --> 01:25:49.082]  Call Piscot Enterprises at 800-569-4340.
[01:25:49.082 --> 01:25:49.402]  That's 1-800-569-4340.
[01:25:49.402 --> 01:25:50.723]  If you're suffering, try MSM.
[01:25:50.723 --> 01:25:51.364]  It worked for me.
[01:25:57.288 --> 01:26:06.118]  Berkey water filters are the ultimate filters used worldwide for normal or hostile filtration environments to provide the most delicious, sparkling, clean water possible.
[01:26:06.118 --> 01:26:11.885]  The Berkey Light self-sterilizing filter elements remove pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, chemicals,
[01:26:12.125 --> 01:26:17.547]  And they reduce lead, mercury, aluminum, nitrate, salt for odors, fowl tastes, and much, much more.
[01:26:17.547 --> 01:26:20.588]  Yet, they leave in the nutritional minerals that your body needs.
[01:26:20.588 --> 01:26:27.210]  The Berkey Light has ridges to deflect water if the upper chamber is overfilled and it can be used anywhere on a flat surface.
[01:26:27.210 --> 01:26:29.290]  That's because it has an elevated base.
[01:26:29.290 --> 01:26:35.572]  The entire system joins together to make the Berkey Light convenient to transport, even while it's filtering water.
[01:26:35.572 --> 01:26:41.194]  Its rechargeable bright white LED lamps allow for optimum use at night or during emergency conditions.
[01:26:41.554 --> 01:26:45.498]  Get the Berkey Light, the ultimate filter for only $259 by calling New Millennium at 888-803-4438.
[01:26:45.498 --> 01:26:46.219]  That's toll-free, 888-803-4438.

[01:26:57.182 --> 01:26:58.882]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[01:26:58.882 --> 01:27:02.103]  And the behavior of our police is a reflection of our government.
[01:27:02.103 --> 01:27:06.044]  One look in the mirror and we know our country is entering a high-tech police state.
[01:27:06.044 --> 01:27:10.625]  Here's just a sample from my documentary film, Police State 2 The Takeover.
[01:27:10.625 --> 01:27:14.326]  In downtown Seattle today, the First Amendment ended.
[01:27:14.326 --> 01:27:16.367]  A civil emergency was created by the police.
[01:27:16.687 --> 01:27:19.890]  Riot police attack people on the street indiscriminately.
[01:27:19.890 --> 01:27:24.754]  The medical bills are going to be enormous for me.
[01:27:24.754 --> 01:27:27.976]  You see them here with their hands cupped behind their backs.
[01:27:27.976 --> 01:27:31.339]  They are being led into the Sandpoint Brig.
[01:27:31.339 --> 01:27:37.464]  The neighbors in that area, Sandpoint Naval Air Station, were shocked to hear that the old brig was being reopened.
[01:27:37.984 --> 01:27:42.185]  This information is absolutely vital for all freedom lovers in the United States.
[01:27:42.185 --> 01:27:43.886]  Order your video today.

[01:27:52.068 --> 01:27:57.029]  Or go to my website, InfoWars.com.
[01:27:57.029 --> 01:28:02.450]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[01:28:02.450 --> 01:28:04.711]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:28:07.839 --> 01:28:25.415]  Just a program note, I've been getting emails the last few weeks that people are having trouble listening on the net and that's because this broadcast I think has like four streams and at several thousand a stream will max out and so you won't be able to get on that stream.
[01:28:25.415 --> 01:28:27.557]  We've looked at streams that are maxed out.
[01:28:27.557 --> 01:28:31.841]  You'll just need to go to GCNlive.com and click link onto one of the backup streams.
[01:28:33.237 --> 01:28:41.066]  But obviously, for ease of listening, we should probably expand some of those main streams, but no pun intended.
[01:28:42.290 --> 01:28:46.411]  This is very important and the listenership is just exploding.
[01:28:46.411 --> 01:28:54.034]  This broadcast is routinely number one on ShopCast out of 3,400 networks and radio broadcasts.
[01:28:54.034 --> 01:28:58.676]  That's just one of our streams is routinely the number one show in the country.
[01:28:58.676 --> 01:29:00.816]  Then we have all these other streams.
[01:29:00.816 --> 01:29:04.678]  It'll be, you know, number 8, number 12, number 15, number 25.
[01:29:04.678 --> 01:29:11.280]  You combine all our streams on any one day, this broadcast is almost always number one on the net.
[01:29:12.100 --> 01:29:14.962]  And it's no brag, it's just fact.
[01:29:14.962 --> 01:29:19.624]  As John Wayne would say, and we're so blessed to be reaching so many people.
[01:29:19.624 --> 01:29:22.506]  And that's just on the internet, a small part of our listenership.
[01:29:22.506 --> 01:29:29.430]  Then there's the shortwave and the satellite and of course our AM and FM stations that comprise the largest bulk of our listenership.
[01:29:29.890 --> 01:29:36.856]  And if you're listening on satellite, internet, or shortwave and don't have a local AM or FM station, call local mom-and-pop stations.
[01:29:36.856 --> 01:29:40.499]  Don't waste your time with Clear Channel or Infinity.
[01:29:40.499 --> 01:29:41.519]  And ask them.
[01:29:41.519 --> 01:29:44.222]  Pick up an hour or two a day of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:44.222 --> 01:29:44.842]  Oh, don't worry.
[01:29:44.842 --> 01:29:46.203]  You'll get the ratings.
[01:29:46.203 --> 01:29:48.145]  People are very hungry for the truth.
[01:29:48.145 --> 01:29:50.467]  And if you're listening to us on an AM or FM affiliate,
[01:29:51.127 --> 01:29:52.908]  Thank them for carrying the broadcast.
[01:29:52.908 --> 01:29:54.269]  Thank their sponsors.
[01:29:54.269 --> 01:29:55.150]  Sponsor them.
[01:29:55.150 --> 01:29:56.331]  Support them.
[01:29:56.331 --> 01:29:57.312]  Spread the word.
[01:29:57.312 --> 01:29:59.173]  Get some of the local bumper stickers.
[01:29:59.173 --> 01:30:00.654]  Put them on your car.
[01:30:00.654 --> 01:30:05.638]  Because those are precious to us, the growing list of AM and FM stations that we have.
[01:30:05.638 --> 01:30:11.282]  It is so precious to be reaching people as they scan around on their AM and FM car radios.
[01:30:11.282 --> 01:30:16.946]  Radio has more listeners than any other form of media out there because everybody's got an AM and FM radio.
[01:30:17.890 --> 01:30:27.513]  Alright, going back to Mike in Arizona, and then we'll go to Sue and Tom and John and Kathy and others, and then I want to get back in the news with John Buchanan.
[01:30:27.513 --> 01:30:32.574]  But Mike, you want to counter, or do you have any comments to what John Buchanan was just saying?
[01:30:32.574 --> 01:30:40.876]  Yeah, I appreciate Mr. Buchanan's concern from the state of my mental health, but the listeners to Alex's show here know that Israel has been very
[01:30:42.669 --> 01:30:48.211]  It will reach out and kill people that it considers its enemies, no matter where they are.
[01:30:48.211 --> 01:30:54.814]  They didn't exclude the United States, so I took that seriously, and I'm basing my comments on that.
[01:30:54.814 --> 01:30:55.694]  That's a serious point.
[01:30:55.694 --> 01:31:03.317]  Now, on that point, I agree with you absolutely, and I fear the Mossad as much as I fear the CIA, literally.
[01:31:03.317 --> 01:31:07.019]  And on that point, John Loftus is quite vulnerable.
[01:31:07.019 --> 01:31:09.580]  He is a stringent Zionist.
[01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:16.983]  And a pro-Israel propagandist, and on that level, he does not have extreme credibility.
[01:31:16.983 --> 01:31:18.464]  I agree with you 100% on that.
[01:31:18.464 --> 01:31:23.026]  It just makes me nervous that there's information out there that he led death squads.
[01:31:23.026 --> 01:31:35.351]  And strangely enough, if you heard the first hour, I believe from my own investigation, including talking to the Martinsburg, West Virginia homicide detectives who investigated Danny Consolaro's death,
[01:31:35.811 --> 01:31:41.755]  That he was killed by Ted Shockley, the rogue CIA operative I spoke of earlier from the book, Prelude to Terror.
[01:31:41.755 --> 01:31:43.617]  But I have no evidence to prove that.
[01:31:43.617 --> 01:31:46.018]  Okay, Mike, thank you for the call.
[01:31:46.018 --> 01:31:54.965]  Look, you know, the Bible says that the Lord of this planet, the God of this world, is the Old Servant.
[01:31:56.027 --> 01:32:01.333]  And I'm telling you, when you get to the top of the New World Order, this is just the facts, folks.
[01:32:01.333 --> 01:32:11.743]  You got Jews working with Nazis, Nazis working with blacks, Chinese working with Japanese, working with the Russians, working with, you know, good ol' Irish boys.
[01:32:12.424 --> 01:32:15.727]  I mean, it is, across the board, evil people.
[01:32:15.727 --> 01:32:17.589]  Israel's busy arming Iran.
[01:32:17.589 --> 01:32:19.331]  I've got mainstream news articles.
[01:32:19.331 --> 01:32:20.933]  Israel's busy arming China.
[01:32:20.933 --> 01:32:22.935]  Our government's busy arming China.
[01:32:22.935 --> 01:32:24.696]  Russia's busy arming China.
[01:32:24.696 --> 01:32:26.999]  They're busy arming North Korea.
[01:32:26.999 --> 01:32:31.964]  We've got the head of ABB, the Swiss company giving nuclear reactors to North Korea.
[01:32:32.524 --> 01:32:34.625]  None other than our Defense Secretary.
[01:32:34.625 --> 01:32:52.851]  I mean, folks, at the top, you've got a bunch of ruthless, wicked people who will use Communists, who will use Nazis, who will use well-meaning Marine Corps officers, who will use well-meaning Zionists, who will use anybody, who will use well-meaning, you know, anti-Communist Cubans.
[01:32:54.205 --> 01:33:04.988]  That's why you've always got to stand for the Bill of Rights, the Constitution that limits government power and control, because any mechanism of power will be abused.
[01:33:04.988 --> 01:33:06.588]  You've got to limit it.
[01:33:06.588 --> 01:33:13.610]  And whether it's the Communists or the Fascists, it always leads back to the New World Order.
[01:33:13.610 --> 01:33:20.212]  And we're going to go to Sue and Tom and John and Kathy here in a few minutes, but for stations that just joined us, who missed it?
[01:33:21.098 --> 01:33:25.440]  I want you to recap just in five minutes, then we'll go back to calls.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.901]  Your research on the Nazis totally borne out.
[01:33:27.901 --> 01:33:33.664]  Everything John told me six months ago, three weeks ago in a New York hotel room, he said, you'll be in the Guardian.
[01:33:33.664 --> 01:33:34.544]  This is what it'll say.
[01:33:34.544 --> 01:33:35.725]  I gave him the info.
[01:33:35.725 --> 01:33:37.646]  They went to the National Archives with me.
[01:33:37.646 --> 01:33:38.366]  Now it's there.
[01:33:40.367 --> 01:33:44.210]  Now the Bush's wanted martial law in 1934, now they want it again.
[01:33:44.210 --> 01:33:51.715]  And the Bush's martial law comments came up, I have it on video, from 1986 in a congressional hearing.
[01:33:51.715 --> 01:34:04.844]  So this is a system, over and over again, the globalists are infatuated with the Nazi intelligence domestic control model, now bringing out on Friday the bill for the National ID Card.
[01:34:04.844 --> 01:34:06.745]  But John, you've got the floor.
[01:34:06.745 --> 01:34:08.927]  Encapsulate what we've covered in five minutes.
[01:34:09.864 --> 01:34:14.907]  What we've covered, Alex, is the historical facts supported by documents at the U.S.
[01:34:14.907 --> 01:34:29.997]  National Archives and the Library of Congress that, beginning in 1924, the Bush family, in partnership with the Harrimans and George Herbert Walker, this president's maternal great-grandfather, were Adolf Hitler's de facto U.S.
[01:34:29.997 --> 01:34:39.804]  business partners and engineered his rise to power and helped build the Nazi war machine through a German Nazi steel and coal baronet.
[01:34:40.344 --> 01:34:42.065]  Let me stop you.
[01:34:42.065 --> 01:34:53.010]  Not just in business with them as Ford and others were, but the key people over the banks directing it, and then even up into the 50s getting the Nazis out and controlling their wealth.
[01:34:53.010 --> 01:34:54.170]  Correct, correct.
[01:34:54.170 --> 01:34:59.613]  And then after the war, smuggling Nazi assets into Switzerland, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Panama.
[01:35:00.313 --> 01:35:17.926]  After the war, which was admitted today finally by the CIA and reported by UPI, Reinhard Galen, a notorious Nazi war criminal, was the de facto founder of the CIA with Alan Dulles through the influence of Prescott Bush, the grandfather of this president.
[01:35:17.926 --> 01:35:19.848]  Their Nazi dealings continued into the
[01:35:20.168 --> 01:35:20.368]  I think?
[01:35:50.128 --> 01:35:51.149]  Freedom Loving American
[01:36:20.128 --> 01:36:21.068]  We're good to go.
[01:36:51.398 --> 01:37:02.483]  Now, we also have How Bush's Grandfather Helped Hitler's Rise to Power, a detailed 13-page article in the London Guardian, the big paper, the biggest paper in Europe.
[01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:09.065]  This is on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com and PrisonPlanet.tv and Infowars.net.
[01:37:09.065 --> 01:37:11.426]  Right now, folks, you need to get it.
[01:37:11.926 --> 01:37:18.775]  You need to get our copy of this because we added a bunch of links at the bottom to even more pertinent, hardcore information.
[01:37:18.775 --> 01:37:24.462]  And how our media can ignore this is a startling example of how controlled it is.
[01:37:24.462 --> 01:37:29.829]  But they cannot control you from going out and sending this to your entire email list, can they John?
[01:37:30.229 --> 01:37:40.775]  Absolutely not, and not only that, that gives me a perfect moment to interject one thought, Alex, and with five minutes of their time, your listening audience can bring down the New York Times.
[01:37:40.775 --> 01:37:43.496]  They need to write down this email address.
[01:37:43.496 --> 01:37:49.159]  It's executive-editor at nytimes.com.
[01:37:49.159 --> 01:37:50.960]  Executive-editor.
[01:37:52.481 --> 01:37:54.542]  at nytimes.com.
[01:37:54.542 --> 01:37:56.563]  His name is Bill Keller.
[01:37:56.563 --> 01:38:17.090]  If we can flood Bill Keller at the New York Times with emails today and tomorrow and Wednesday demanding that the New York Times cover this story, then we can bring down the Bush administration prior to the election and lead directly to the 911 investigation that the people of this country are crying out for and that the
[01:38:17.090 --> 01:38:17.550]  Well John, I...
[01:38:36.149 --> 01:38:37.170]  John, I appreciate that.
[01:38:37.170 --> 01:38:42.436]  We do share the common cause of the truth, but not just emailing to the New York Times because they can ignore it.
[01:38:42.436 --> 01:38:43.337]  I know you've talked to them.
[01:38:43.337 --> 01:38:49.043]  They refuse to do it, even though it's in a more respected paper, The Guardian, and the documents are public.
[01:38:49.043 --> 01:38:51.906]  We need to get these to every radio and TV station.
[01:38:51.906 --> 01:38:53.948]  We need to email these out to everyone.
[01:38:53.948 --> 01:38:57.752]  We've got to make sure this is top story on all the big websites out there.
[01:38:58.132 --> 01:39:00.274]  That's an even better idea, actually.
[01:39:00.274 --> 01:39:06.540]  I totally agree with you, and I mentioned I'm going out on this National Truth Tour beginning October 11th, right up through Election Day.
[01:39:06.540 --> 01:39:13.546]  What's interesting is that although I have not been able to get the three TV networks on any of this stuff, the network of
[01:39:13.626 --> 01:39:22.612]  Affiliates in everywhere from Seattle to Denver to Coeur d'Alene, Idaho to Philadelphia have committed to covering my National Truth Tour.
[01:39:22.612 --> 01:39:37.063]  So if your listeners will go to FixingAmerica.org and look where I'm headed, first of all, and go to your local press and your local TV stations and demand that they give me a fair chance in their cities to get the truth out.
[01:39:37.063 --> 01:39:42.086]  And then that can spread out across the entire country to every community newspaper, weekly paper.
[01:39:43.107 --> 01:39:45.591]  Local radio station, etc.
[01:39:45.591 --> 01:39:47.294]  TV affiliate radio stations.
[01:39:47.294 --> 01:39:50.538]  We can do it at the grassroots level and that's an even better idea.
[01:39:50.538 --> 01:39:52.361]  Alright, we got a break.
[01:39:52.361 --> 01:39:52.982]  We got a break.
[01:39:52.982 --> 01:39:54.043]  We'll be back with more calls.
[01:39:54.043 --> 01:39:54.524]  Stay with us.

[01:40:57.148 --> 01:40:58.049]  Terrorism!
[01:40:58.049 --> 01:40:58.909]  Terrorism!
[01:40:58.909 --> 01:41:05.214]  Chemical attacks, dirty bombs, fallout, biological attack, hand threats, and to top it all off, duct tape and plastic!
[01:41:05.214 --> 01:41:07.055]  Alarming words for our time!
[01:41:07.055 --> 01:41:09.937]  But how do you protect your family during such a crisis?
[01:41:09.937 --> 01:41:24.548]  The video sheltering in place surviving acts of terrorism from biological, chemical, and radioactive fallout was developed by Wayne LeBaron, a health physicist who has served as a specialist in environmental health, communicable diseases, and has worked as a nuclear specialist for the U.S.
[01:41:24.548 --> 01:41:25.028]  government.

[01:41:27.190 --> 01:41:33.253]  It's presented by a housewife as they walk you step-by-step through the process of preparing your home as a shelter.
[01:41:33.253 --> 01:41:37.996]  If you're not the type who waits till it's too late, then you need the video Sheltering in Place.

[01:41:57.867 --> 01:42:00.128]  Jack Brownring for Midas Resources.
[01:42:00.128 --> 01:42:04.051]  Last summer we did some two-year comparisons between the equity markets and gold.
[01:42:04.051 --> 01:42:05.251]  Let's update.
[01:42:05.251 --> 01:42:08.813]  January of 2002 to January of 2004, the Dow was up a whopping 2.2%.
[01:42:08.813 --> 01:42:13.756]  The Nasdaq in that same time frame is flat.
[01:42:13.756 --> 01:42:14.737]  Two years ago the U.S.
[01:42:14.737 --> 01:42:16.177]  dollar was worth 17% more than a year old.
[01:42:17.558 --> 01:42:18.519]  Today, the U.S.
[01:42:18.519 --> 01:42:21.120]  dollar is worth 28% less than the Euro.
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:23.221]  Guess which one has gold backing?
[01:42:23.221 --> 01:42:26.562]  January of 2002, gold's spot was 283.
[01:42:26.562 --> 01:42:32.425]  January of 2004, it's well over $400 at a 13-year high, up near 40%.
[01:42:32.425 --> 01:42:33.425]  Gold is moving.
[01:42:33.425 --> 01:42:34.986]  Equities are treading water.
[01:42:34.986 --> 01:42:37.627]  To say little of the billions lost in market scandals.
[01:42:38.183 --> 01:42:39.984]  Put your money in a safe haven.
[01:42:39.984 --> 01:42:42.105]  Physical possession, private gold.
[01:42:42.105 --> 01:42:44.485]  Remember, gold cannot go bankrupt.
[01:42:44.485 --> 01:42:48.767]  Call Midas Resources today, 800-686-2237.
[01:42:48.767 --> 01:42:51.308]  Protect yourself, protect your loved ones.
[01:42:51.308 --> 01:42:51.608]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:42:57.153 --> 01:42:58.835]  Hi folks, this is Michael Trudeau.
[01:42:58.835 --> 01:43:06.481]  Jerry Guadetti from the Ark Institute just called to tell me their new 100% non-hybrid family seed packages are ready right now.
[01:43:06.481 --> 01:43:11.165]  You've heard me rave about the great gardens I've grown from the Ark Institute's heirloom seeds.
[01:43:11.165 --> 01:43:21.014]  Tomatoes with real old-time tomato taste, big sweet onions, bright red and green lettuces, sweet corn, peppers, melons, cukes, beans, peas, pumpkins, popcorn, and so much more.
[01:43:21.755 --> 01:43:25.759]  50 generous seed packets in all for the best tasting, healthiest garden ever.
[01:43:25.759 --> 01:43:28.262]  And there's no need to buy vegetable seeds ever again.
[01:43:28.262 --> 01:43:34.729]  These non-hybrid seeds can be saved from your own fruits and veggies year after year for family food security.
[01:43:34.729 --> 01:43:36.291]  These days, that's just plain smart.
[01:43:36.531 --> 01:43:37.512]  Friends, don't wait.
[01:43:37.512 --> 01:43:40.654]  The Ark Institute runs out of these rare seeds every year.
[01:43:40.654 --> 01:43:41.595]  Call them today at 800-255-1912.
[01:43:41.595 --> 01:43:41.835]  That's 800-255-1912.
[01:43:41.835 --> 01:43:45.797]  Don't forget to visit arkinstitute.com and read Jerry's Food Supply Updates.
[01:43:45.797 --> 01:43:46.518]  It's powerful stuff.
[01:44:01.543 --> 01:44:05.284]  Twenty-four minutes and five seconds into this third hour.
[01:44:05.284 --> 01:44:07.745]  Thank you for joining us on this Monday edition.
[01:44:07.745 --> 01:44:14.867]  I'm going to take some more calls and I'm going to blitz through a bunch of news, pun intended, with our Nazi friends the Bushes.
[01:44:14.867 --> 01:44:22.469]  I'm involved in every type of criminal enterprise you can imagine, ladies and gentlemen, but they're just a high-level servant family to these globalists.
[01:44:23.371 --> 01:44:25.752]  Sue in Pennsylvania.
[01:44:25.752 --> 01:44:27.452]  Thanks for holding her on the air, Sue.
[01:44:27.452 --> 01:44:28.973]  Yeah, hi Alex.
[01:44:28.973 --> 01:44:48.559]  I think you kind of answered my question a little bit before, but my misunderstanding or my confusion is how does the neocons, the Wolfowitzs, the Pearls, and all of them kind of reconcile working within the Nazi connection of the Bush family?
[01:44:48.559 --> 01:44:51.180]  I know it's a lot bigger than what I
[01:44:52.714 --> 01:45:09.267]  How do they basically reconcile that whole, you know, promoting the United States agenda, Israel's agenda as the United States, and obviously the connection with the Nazis
[01:45:10.409 --> 01:45:19.915]  Well that's what I said earlier, is if you look at the neocons, and a lot of them do happen to claim that they're Jewish, most of them have blonde hair and blue eyes, it's kind of funny.
[01:45:19.915 --> 01:45:25.899]  They're up there claiming that everything they're doing is for Israel, but meanwhile they're setting up this big police state here.
[01:45:25.899 --> 01:45:29.882]  That's how they manipulate their foot soldiers who think they're doing the right things.
[01:45:30.262 --> 01:45:30.502]  We're good.
[01:45:49.284 --> 01:46:02.743]  Just like they were also admirers of Trotsky and the Fourth International, how Trotsky wanted to do things very similar to Hitler, a different model than what Lenin had.
[01:46:03.729 --> 01:46:08.452]  And so, what you've got is, it's like in my article I wrote about Arnold.
[01:46:08.452 --> 01:46:10.714]  The New World Order has big plans for Arnold.
[01:46:10.714 --> 01:46:22.663]  In that article I say, you know, the New World Order is the remnants of Emperor Kings, and royalty, and Nazis, and just all these different groups coming together wanting world empire.
[01:46:22.663 --> 01:46:29.748]  And the seed, the seed money to overthrow our intelligence agencies fully, they were already corrupt,
[01:46:30.348 --> 01:46:42.278]  To set up new ones, to set up the National Security Dictatorship with Clark Clifford and then BCCI and this whole train of events was predominantly done with Nazi money.
[01:46:42.278 --> 01:46:49.083]  And everybody knows that the Nazis ran our rocket programs and our intelligence, but quote, they were just advisors.
[01:46:49.083 --> 01:46:53.106]  You know, the Goddard Space Center and Wernher von Braun and all of this.
[01:46:53.106 --> 01:46:58.611]  But whether it was Klaus Barbie or Joseph Mingala or, you know, any of these characters,
[01:46:59.091 --> 01:47:10.119]  They were well taken care of, and they helped set it up here, because they were agents to begin with of the New World Order, even throughout Hitler's rise.
[01:47:10.119 --> 01:47:11.600]  John Buchanan comments?
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:23.928]  Yeah, I'd like to add a contemporary component to that answer, Sue, because that's a very good question that you ask, and many people find that baffling, and I would like to preface my answer by telling you
[01:47:24.068 --> 01:47:24.708]  I don't think so.
[01:47:44.779 --> 01:48:10.330]  which called for the New Pearl Harbor attack has aligned itself for reasons of greed having to do with war profiteering and ideology not religion or spirituality have aligned themselves with an extreme right-wing group of Christians called the Dominionists and they take their name from the biblical passage that God will give Christians dominion over the earth
[01:48:11.130 --> 01:48:22.538]  They believe, or they profess to believe, that the Jews have broken their covenant with God and that they, the Dominionists, are God's new elect or chosen people.
[01:48:22.538 --> 01:48:36.788]  The reason we are in Iraq, the reason we are in Afghanistan, the reason, as Alex mentioned, that we will invade Iran as soon as he is re-elected, if not before, is that they want to provoke World War III in the Middle East
[01:48:37.288 --> 01:48:44.693]  To annihilate all Jews and Muslims who do not accept Jesus as their personal savior in the final days.
[01:48:44.693 --> 01:48:45.714]  Now let me stop you.
[01:48:45.714 --> 01:48:46.775]  Let me stop you.
[01:48:46.775 --> 01:48:47.856]  What we have is...
[01:48:49.224 --> 01:48:57.967]  Nazi groups, Christian groups, Jewish groups, who are really just globalists at the top, cynically manipulating good Christians, Jews.
[01:48:57.967 --> 01:49:03.889]  It's just like the globalists funded the radical Muslim groups, we catch them funding the Al Qaeda's, the Taliban's.
[01:49:03.889 --> 01:49:08.771]  Anything to radicalize, just like creating Hitler or the Communists,
[01:49:09.111 --> 01:49:12.153]  To all get us fighting with each other.
[01:49:12.153 --> 01:49:18.438]  And so, what they do is they twist all of this, when in truth we research them, they're at Bohemian Grove.
[01:49:18.438 --> 01:49:20.339]  They're at Stone and Bones.
[01:49:20.339 --> 01:49:22.400]  Let me finish.
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:25.503]  When they're really at church, it's devil worship.
[01:49:25.503 --> 01:49:26.784]  That's what they really are.
[01:49:26.784 --> 01:49:34.489]  They're devil worshipers putting on outfits to manipulate their own little subgroup to make their subgroup go along with it.
[01:49:34.489 --> 01:49:36.791]  And that's what Albert Pike said in 1878, the Supreme Grand Mason.
[01:49:39.025 --> 01:49:41.146]  And I'll let you finish up when we get back.
[01:49:41.146 --> 01:49:44.267]  Sorry to interrupt you there, Mr. Buchanan.
[01:49:44.267 --> 01:49:44.767]  Stay with us.
[01:49:44.767 --> 01:49:47.728]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:47.728 --> 01:49:48.708]  We're on the march.
[01:49:48.708 --> 01:49:50.749]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:49:50.749 --> 01:49:54.330]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:49:57.441 --> 01:50:02.845]  I'm a nurse and I injured my back and I've lost 22 pounds and 9 inches.
[01:50:02.845 --> 01:50:04.987]  I would definitely recommend Vim and Vigor.
[01:50:04.987 --> 01:50:10.371]  As far as losing weight, Vim and Vigor is the best investment I ever made.
[01:50:10.371 --> 01:50:12.212]  It actually works.
[01:50:12.212 --> 01:50:15.654]  I have tried and been on so many weight loss things over the years.
[01:50:15.654 --> 01:50:17.336]  I've tried many, many products.
[01:50:17.336 --> 01:50:19.958]  I have never experienced anything like College Naked.
[01:50:19.958 --> 01:50:24.000]  I have lost 17 pounds in a little less than 8 weeks.
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:24.661]  It truly works.
[01:50:25.014 --> 01:50:26.575]  Collagenate is wonderful.
[01:50:26.575 --> 01:50:32.377]  Join the crowd of people that have been telling us how much weight they've been losing through Collagenate from Vim and Vigor.
[01:50:32.377 --> 01:50:38.320]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate works with your body to improve fat metabolism and that means a leaner, healthier you.
[01:50:38.320 --> 01:50:41.281]  Vim and Vigor's Collagenate really does work.
[01:50:41.281 --> 01:50:42.501]  It's healthy for you too.
[01:50:42.501 --> 01:50:43.542]  Call Vim and Vigor today.
[01:50:43.542 --> 01:50:43.782]  1-800-622-THIN.
[01:50:43.782 --> 01:50:44.022]  That's 1-800-622-8446.
[01:50:48.464 --> 01:50:51.428]  Get $25 off a 3 month supply of Collagenate.

[01:50:54.431 --> 01:50:57.915]  Again, 1-800-622-8446.
[01:50:57.915 --> 01:51:02.861]  Now you can bring Berkey purification power anywhere with the Sport Berkey filtration bottle.
[01:51:03.422 --> 01:51:08.647]  It's ideal for sporting games, camping or boating, or sport Berkey is small enough to store in your glove box.
[01:51:08.647 --> 01:51:13.292]  So it's ideal backup for unexpected emergencies like blackouts, floods or earthquakes.
[01:51:13.292 --> 01:51:16.615]  It's simply the best personal water filtration system available.
[01:51:16.615 --> 01:51:20.059]  So effective you can drink raw untreated water from lakes, rivers and streams.
[01:51:20.379 --> 01:51:29.981]  Unlike other sport bottles, the Sport Berkey's patented filter formulation is so powerful it removes cysts, parasites, harmful bacteria, and chemicals like herbicides and pesticides.
[01:51:29.981 --> 01:51:33.721]  It even reduces radon-222, lead, and other heavy metals.
[01:51:33.721 --> 01:51:41.083]  This lightweight, rugged 22-ounce filter is small enough to go everywhere, so take one to work and keep another in your glove box for emergencies.

[01:51:57.008 --> 01:51:58.709]  So, what's in your shampoo?
[01:51:58.709 --> 01:52:00.010]  Sodium lauryl sulfate?
[01:52:00.010 --> 01:52:03.532]  Exposure can lead to coughing, wheezing, shortness of breath, headache, and nausea.
[01:52:03.532 --> 01:52:04.292]  Phenol!
[01:52:04.292 --> 01:52:11.316]  Ingestion of even small amounts may cause circulatory collapse, paralysis, convulsions, coma, respiratory failure, and cardiac arrest.
[01:52:11.676 --> 01:52:15.898]  EDTA may be irritating the skin and mucous membranes and cause allergies such as asthma.
[01:52:15.898 --> 01:52:16.718]  Fragrance?
[01:52:16.718 --> 01:52:21.621]  Fragrance on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[01:52:21.621 --> 01:52:26.523]  Symptoms reported to the FDA include headache, dizziness, rashes, and skin discolorations to name a few.
[01:52:26.523 --> 01:52:28.944]  Now by contrast, here's what's in my Cal Bend shampoo.
[01:52:29.344 --> 01:52:32.905]  Well, like all of the products from the Calden Pure Soap Company, it's all natural.
[01:52:32.905 --> 01:52:36.646]  It contains extra virgin cocoa butter oils and vegetable protein oil.
[01:52:36.646 --> 01:52:39.166]  No harsh chemicals, no pork or beef tallow.
[01:52:39.166 --> 01:52:40.166]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:52:40.166 --> 01:52:50.109]  Call now 1-800-340-7091 and find out how a family of four can save over $1,000 per year on all of your cleaning products with Calden Pure Soaps.

[01:52:58.274 --> 01:53:01.036]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation.
[01:53:01.036 --> 01:53:08.141]  It's Alex Jones, only on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:53:08.141 --> 01:53:18.149]  And I want to make it clear that any Christian that considers themselves a Dominionist, that term of we should occupy and educate and proselytize, that's a good thing.
[01:53:19.113 --> 01:53:22.376]  We're talking about, like, clones, counterfeits.
[01:53:22.376 --> 01:53:23.517]  That's what the globalists do.
[01:53:23.517 --> 01:53:25.639]  That's what their father does.
[01:53:25.639 --> 01:53:27.981]  Is they create clones, counterfeits of everything.
[01:53:27.981 --> 01:53:33.306]  I mean, I knew about this ten years ago and I was shocked by it, but Salon Magazine had a big article.
[01:53:34.361 --> 01:54:02.245]  about these top supposed Zionists uh... who were friends with Hitler and their public documents that they put out in magazines about we need to get Hitler in and we need Hitler to take over and let Hitler kill a bunch of Jews, he'll teach these Jews to follow us these Orthodox Jews uh... you know uh... we like Hitler that's public record and people just can't compute that you know why is Lord Rothschild funding Arnold Schwarzenegger when he says he loves Hitler and Kurt Voltheim?
[01:54:02.905 --> 01:54:07.389]  And then we're anti-semitic because we're against Hitler.
[01:54:07.389 --> 01:54:10.272]  I'm not even trying to be sarcastic there, folks.
[01:54:10.272 --> 01:54:20.701]  It's gotten to this craziness where these counterfeits are running everything, and then oh, Arnold's good, the people that criticize him, why they're not friends of Israel.
[01:54:20.701 --> 01:54:22.803]  So it's a sick, sick, sick joke.
[01:54:23.583 --> 01:54:26.105]  John Buchanan, finish up what you were saying, we're getting a few more calls.
[01:54:26.105 --> 01:54:32.628]  Yeah, two more quick points, Alex, and one goes to what you just said, but first I'd like to go back to the caller who asked.
[01:54:32.628 --> 01:54:34.409]  You need to do the research.
[01:54:34.409 --> 01:54:39.391]  If you go to Google and put in Dominionism or Dominionists, it'll come up.
[01:54:39.391 --> 01:54:45.214]  The best website in terms of knowing about what they're doing is Eureka Report.
[01:54:45.214 --> 01:54:49.196]  Y-U-R-I-C-A report.com.
[01:54:49.196 --> 01:54:50.297]  Catherine Eureka,
[01:54:51.077 --> 01:54:55.100]  The editor of that site is the world's leading expert on the religious right.
[01:54:55.100 --> 01:55:05.666]  She's been studying Pat Robertson for 20 years and she will be appearing with me October 26th at the National Press Club in Washington.
[01:55:05.666 --> 01:55:08.588]  To explain this though, this is a co-opting arm.
[01:55:09.148 --> 01:55:11.230]  Co-opting arm, absolutely.
[01:55:11.230 --> 01:55:27.064]  But to go to your point, the point you just made Alex, to me the most incredible thing about the Guardian article was they cited the fact that the Anti-Defamation League, now that the Guardian knows the Bushes were Nazis and they have these documents,
[01:55:27.464 --> 01:55:40.895]  That the Anti-Defamation League, the ADL, has furiously claimed that this is a smear against the Bush family, these documents are fakes, my whole story is a fraud, etc.
[01:55:40.895 --> 01:55:48.942]  And this afternoon I'm going to call Abe Foxman at the ADL, who refused last year to help me get the story out, and take him to task.
[01:55:49.042 --> 01:55:56.707]  Understand, understand, we have mainstream East Coast big papers, 1942, Prescott Bush grabbed by police.
[01:55:56.707 --> 01:55:58.889]  It's not like this is debatable.
[01:55:58.889 --> 01:56:01.731]  The London Guardian and others have been to the National Archives.
[01:56:01.731 --> 01:56:03.712]  The documents are there in public.
[01:56:03.712 --> 01:56:06.034]  Anybody, you know, we're not Dan Rather.
[01:56:06.034 --> 01:56:10.417]  Also, we're not the Bush Administration creating all these fake Niger weapons dossiers.
[01:56:10.417 --> 01:56:17.182]  So you're telling me Foxman is trying to claim that the Bushes and Brown Brother Harriman were not grabbed for trading with the enemy?
[01:56:17.182 --> 01:56:18.023]  That's public!
[01:56:18.023 --> 01:56:18.303]  Correct.
[01:56:18.903 --> 01:56:19.464]  Absolutely.
[01:56:19.464 --> 01:56:22.427]  But incredible as that sounds, Alex, that is the case, number one.
[01:56:22.427 --> 01:56:26.411]  And number two, to go back to Sue... Well, no, it's not incredible.
[01:56:26.411 --> 01:56:29.534]  They say Arnold is just wonderful.
[01:56:29.534 --> 01:56:29.915]  Agreed.
[01:56:29.915 --> 01:56:33.378]  To recapitulate a different form of Sue's question...
[01:56:34.079 --> 01:56:45.849]  Since a lot of major newspapers, including the New York Times, are owned by Jewish families and edited by Jewish editors, how could it not be an eight-column banner headline in this morning's New York Times?
[01:56:45.849 --> 01:56:49.732]  Bush family profited from slave labor at Auschwitz.
[01:56:49.732 --> 01:56:54.396]  And you hit it right on the head several times that I've just been listening to you, Alex, without being on.
[01:56:54.396 --> 01:56:56.258]  The Zionists are the new Nazis.
[01:56:56.578 --> 01:57:12.003]  The Zionists believe they're superior, they use the Holocaust as their invocation of superiority so that the Jews can survive, and they don't understand, or they don't accept, that the Bush administration and the neocons have a plan for wiping them out.
[01:57:12.003 --> 01:57:16.845]  And if they do it this time, the Holocaust is going to be successful, and the Jews will be gone.
[01:57:16.845 --> 01:57:22.247]  And if the Jews are too stupid to understand that, then I think they should be gone.
[01:57:22.247 --> 01:57:25.848]  Under Darwin's laws of survival, they don't have the will to survive.
[01:57:25.848 --> 01:57:26.248]  Too bad.
[01:57:26.508 --> 01:57:27.929]  Why?
[01:57:27.929 --> 01:57:29.090]  Well, I know you're being sarcastic.
[01:57:29.090 --> 01:57:31.671]  I'm being sarcastic, of course, but you know what I mean.
[01:57:31.671 --> 01:57:33.513]  Everyone has to stand up for truth.
[01:57:33.513 --> 01:57:37.175]  The truth is non-partisan.
[01:57:37.175 --> 01:57:42.719]  The truth is universal and applies equally to every human being on this planet.
[01:57:42.719 --> 01:57:49.043]  And until the truth can be comprehended by all of us, all of us are doomed, in my opinion.
[01:57:49.588 --> 01:57:52.750]  Well, it's all out of control.
[01:57:52.750 --> 01:57:54.372]  Tom in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:57:54.372 --> 01:57:55.613]  Go ahead, Tom.
[01:57:55.613 --> 01:57:56.854]  Yes, sir.
[01:57:56.854 --> 01:58:07.982]  Hitler, in his own words, in Mein Kampf, Volume 1, 1925, the art of leadership is to consolidate the attention of the people against a single adversary.
[01:58:07.982 --> 01:58:11.285]  Taking care that nothing will split up that attention.
[01:58:12.250 --> 01:58:14.953]  That's a quote from Mein Kampf and Hitler's own words.
[01:58:14.953 --> 01:58:21.619]  Well, we posted a Goebbels text last week and it sounded like George Bush's speech.
[01:58:21.619 --> 01:58:26.563]  Just take out Jews or Communists and put in Muslims.
[01:58:26.563 --> 01:58:32.769]  Meanwhile, all the radical Muslim groups, every time we follow it back, it's MI6 or CIA.
[01:58:35.492 --> 01:58:37.353]  Why don't we just organize a march?
[01:58:37.353 --> 01:58:46.258]  We're doing a lot of informing people and talking a lot, but we need to get on our feet and do something here.
[01:58:46.258 --> 01:58:48.179]  They've got me down where I'm broke all the time.
[01:58:48.179 --> 01:58:50.160]  I can't buy the videos.
[01:58:50.160 --> 01:58:55.042]  I could probably find somebody to record them for me and what have you.
[01:58:55.042 --> 01:59:00.465]  But I've been doing a lot of research for years on this and I feel like I haven't done enough.
[01:59:00.465 --> 01:59:03.987]  I think that maybe I should have done more back in the early days when I had that
[01:59:05.068 --> 01:59:08.611]  It's going to happen in, you know, a job I've talked about before.
[01:59:08.611 --> 01:59:13.756]  About that church with the swastika and all this other... Yeah, Bush's church in Houston with a swastika.
[01:59:13.756 --> 01:59:14.836]  Thanks for the call, sir.
[01:59:14.836 --> 01:59:16.558]  I appreciate it.
[01:59:16.558 --> 01:59:20.701]  Let's see, if you want to talk to him, he gave Tex Marsh the documents.
[01:59:20.701 --> 01:59:21.902]  Pretty wild stuff.
[01:59:21.902 --> 01:59:23.083]  John in Ohio.
[01:59:23.083 --> 01:59:24.024]  John, you're on the air.
[01:59:24.024 --> 01:59:25.165]  Go ahead.
[01:59:25.165 --> 01:59:32.231]  The last lady that called, I would take her question to be that, what was the common denominator between Prescott Bush
[01:59:32.976 --> 01:59:37.701]  Wall Street and all the big industrialists, the military-industrial complex supporting Hitler.
[01:59:37.701 --> 01:59:39.823]  And that occurred back then.
[01:59:39.823 --> 01:59:42.766]  The plot to seize the White House by Jules Archer documents that.
[01:59:42.766 --> 01:59:45.108]  But sir, let me finish.
[01:59:45.108 --> 01:59:48.852]  The Bushes just weren't part of the money-making like a bunch of other people.
[01:59:48.852 --> 01:59:51.995]  They were the center of it, protecting it, running it.
[01:59:51.995 --> 01:59:54.197]  After the war, getting the Nazis out.
[01:59:54.677 --> 01:59:55.397]  Right.
[01:59:55.397 --> 01:59:58.818]  And I know I'll probably be attacked by the ADL for wanting to fight Nazis.
[01:59:58.818 --> 01:59:59.819]  I understand that.
[01:59:59.819 --> 02:00:10.242]  But the point I'm making here is that it was Prescott Bush as well as some of the Fortune 500s who had this comedy nominator of policy and ideology with the Nazis.
[02:00:10.242 --> 02:00:14.683]  And that comedy nominator, as John Buchanan said, was anti-communism.
[02:00:15.083 --> 02:00:16.484]  John, you're not very sophisticated.
[02:00:16.484 --> 02:00:17.344]  You call once a week or so.
[02:00:17.344 --> 02:00:17.745]  I think I am.
[02:00:17.745 --> 02:00:21.827]  Don't you understand they fund both sides of command and control, as Professor Carol Quigley said?
[02:00:33.874 --> 02:00:42.745]  You know, I think because you've been steeped inside that kind of virtue society, rabid anti-communist... No, because I know history, Bubba!
[02:00:42.745 --> 02:00:46.469]  Our government gave communist Russia nuclear weapons!
[02:00:46.469 --> 02:00:48.652]  Our government put Mao in!
[02:00:48.652 --> 02:00:51.195]  You're going to end up on the side of the neo-fascists.
[02:00:51.195 --> 02:00:51.916]  That was their...
[02:00:53.336 --> 02:01:00.839]  Anti-Communism, when they were in the Reagan-Bush administration, and when it comes to an attack on China... Put him on hold, put him on hold, put him on hold.
[02:01:00.839 --> 02:01:03.480]  They're command and controllers, sir.
[02:01:03.480 --> 02:01:05.621]  I'm not emotional about this.
[02:01:05.621 --> 02:01:06.921]  I've researched it.
[02:01:06.921 --> 02:01:15.965]  The big banks put Hitler in, they put Lenin in, they put Mao in, they put Fidel Castro in, they shut them up and they knock them down.
[02:01:16.840 --> 02:01:19.342]  They build up an enemy and they knock it down.
[02:01:19.342 --> 02:01:22.384]  Problem, reaction, solution.
[02:01:22.384 --> 02:01:31.431]  It'd be like if somebody was from the Taliban, and I tried to explain to them, I've had Muslims call them, well, you're right about Bush, but you're wrong saying that the Muslims are bad.
[02:01:31.431 --> 02:01:34.354]  Well, no, most Muslim countries, they'll kill Christians.
[02:01:34.354 --> 02:01:35.094]  It is bad.
[02:01:35.094 --> 02:01:36.655]  Saudi Arabia is bad.
[02:01:36.655 --> 02:01:38.057]  What they do is bad.
[02:01:38.057 --> 02:01:40.679]  How they want to kill everybody in Israel is bad.
[02:01:40.679 --> 02:01:42.800]  But that doesn't mean Israel's good either.
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:45.622]  I'm showing, see, look, I hear people say this.
[02:01:46.443 --> 02:01:51.266]  We ought to kill all the Iraqis and bomb them and cut all their heads off because they're cutting our people's heads off.
[02:01:51.266 --> 02:01:52.286]  It's total war.
[02:01:52.286 --> 02:01:54.528]  Well, you just made their argument for them.
[02:01:54.528 --> 02:01:59.030]  You see, it's this bestial, mindless war that makes you switch your brain off.
[02:01:59.030 --> 02:02:05.614]  The communists were funded by the elites to con the serfs back into slavery, John.
[02:02:05.614 --> 02:02:07.155]  And why you can't figure that out.
[02:02:07.155 --> 02:02:08.316]  Go ahead.
[02:02:08.316 --> 02:02:12.038]  I had one thing there, John Pollack, and I just had one quick point so you'll know it's a fact.
[02:02:12.038 --> 02:02:13.559]  I haven't talked about it on Alex's show before.
[02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:15.760]  I'd like to comment, too.
[02:02:15.760 --> 02:02:17.981]  Go ahead.
[02:02:17.981 --> 02:02:26.122]  From the documents I have seen at the National Archives, and everybody got caught up in the Bush Nazi documents because of the Nazi word.
[02:02:26.122 --> 02:02:36.404]  I've also seen thousands of pages of documents that, beginning with the Russian Revolution, they funded the Bolsheviks, they funded Stalin.
[02:02:36.404 --> 02:02:43.045]  W. Averill Harriman worked personally with Stalin, with companies in Russia that extracted resources from Russia.
[02:02:45.586 --> 02:02:46.467]  Exactly.
[02:02:46.467 --> 02:02:54.094]  Stalin murdered 6-8 million innocent people while W. Averill Harriman was his business partner.
[02:02:54.094 --> 02:03:06.885]  And his reward was that in 1943, W. Averill Harriman was appointed ambassador to the USSR, made hundreds of millions of dollars in blood money profits in Russia,
[02:03:07.325 --> 02:03:12.867]  And then what happens after W. Averill Harriman in 1943 is appointed ambassador to Russia?
[02:03:12.867 --> 02:03:15.127]  We win the war with our ally Russia.
[02:03:15.127 --> 02:03:23.850]  Common sense would dictate to any reasonable person that W. Averill Harriman would sit down with his buddy Stalin and say, gee, we won the war together.
[02:03:23.850 --> 02:03:24.550]  Let's be friends.
[02:03:24.550 --> 02:03:26.490]  Let's crack open a bottle of beer.
[02:03:26.490 --> 02:03:29.431]  And what happened is they were immediately demonized.
[02:03:29.431 --> 02:03:31.572]  We turned on Stalin and we got the Cold War.
[02:03:31.572 --> 02:03:36.313]  Because that makes more money and centralizes power for both sides that are controlled by the same people.
[02:03:37.574 --> 02:03:52.488]  Well, look, what I'm saying here is that, you know, I don't think that Stalin was anything but a dictator who perverted that revolution, but you have 14 capitalist countries invading the Soviet Union immediately after the war to strangle the Soviet Union.
[02:03:52.488 --> 02:03:57.913]  That completely throws into contact this claim that it was the industrialists who were behind the Soviet Union.
[02:03:57.913 --> 02:04:00.596]  Who in their right mind is the Soviet Union?
[02:04:01.229 --> 02:04:07.894]  Fourteen capitalist countries, including the United States, sent troop divisions to Murmansk and Vladivostok to strangle the Soviet Union.
[02:04:07.894 --> 02:04:09.395]  No, they gave half of it to them.
[02:04:09.395 --> 02:04:11.276]  Sir, you don't know what you're talking about.
[02:04:11.276 --> 02:04:12.457]  Thanks for the call.
[02:04:12.457 --> 02:04:14.178]  Man, you just never get it through their head.
[02:04:14.178 --> 02:04:16.080]  Let me read what Professor Carl Quigley said.
[02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:16.160]  Okay?
[02:04:18.405 --> 02:04:20.568]  Let me just read what Professor Carol Quigley said.
[02:04:20.568 --> 02:04:21.990]  Let me find it in my book.
[02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.791]  I've got a quote of this.
[02:04:36.528 --> 02:04:41.911]  Has no aversion to cooperating with the Communists and or any other group and frequently does so.
[02:04:41.911 --> 02:04:50.897]  I know the operations of this network because I have studied it for 20 years and was permitted for 2 years in the early 60's to examine its papers and secret records.
[02:04:50.897 --> 02:04:57.181]  I have no aversion to it or to most of its aims and have for much of my life been close to it and to many of its instruments.
[02:04:57.581 --> 02:05:09.165]  I have objected, both in the past and recently, to a few of its policies, but in general my chief difference of opinion is that it wishes to remain unknown, and I believe its role in history is significant enough to be known.
[02:05:09.165 --> 02:05:12.486]  Professor Carol Quigley in his book, Tragedy and Hope, 1966.
[02:05:12.486 --> 02:05:22.530]  So while we're talking about liberals and conservatives and Zionists and Nazis and communists and everything else, we're dealing with organized crime.
[02:05:22.530 --> 02:05:23.170]  Go ahead, John.
[02:05:24.584 --> 02:05:44.015]  I agree with you 100%, Alex, and you just brought up another really interesting, very important point that your listeners, including John, need to get comfortable with, and that is that all of those labels you just mentioned are a complicating factor to make them overlook the fact that there's them,
[02:05:45.496 --> 02:05:46.658]  And there's us.
[02:05:46.658 --> 02:05:51.943]  And the them is about one-third of one percent of the American population.
[02:05:51.943 --> 02:05:56.569]  The ruling white elite that control everything.
[02:05:56.569 --> 02:05:58.411]  You said it yourself earlier, Alex.
[02:05:58.411 --> 02:06:01.054]  They have twisted the Bible at this point.
[02:06:01.514 --> 02:06:11.096]  To confuse and terrify millions and millions of honest, God-fearing American Christians, Jews, and Muslims.
[02:06:11.096 --> 02:06:19.238]  They have turned all of us against one another in the name of fighting terrorism, and they are brilliant at what they do.
[02:06:19.238 --> 02:06:22.619]  They have completely, as George Orwell wrote about 70 years ago,
[02:06:23.599 --> 02:06:26.623]  Subverted the entire notion of what truth is.
[02:06:26.623 --> 02:06:32.570]  And I would point out, if you didn't see it and your listeners didn't see it, I bought it this morning, but I haven't read it yet.
[02:06:32.570 --> 02:06:41.160]  Believe it or not, the cover story in the new issue of Time Magazine, the cover line is, Who Owns The Truth?
[02:06:42.600 --> 02:06:44.741]  Well, I'm going to write a letter to Time Magazine.
[02:06:44.741 --> 02:06:49.764]  The fact is that the truth is the truth, and everything else is propaganda.
[02:06:49.764 --> 02:06:57.788]  So Time Magazine now has come out with a cover story, ten pages long, on the concept of the truth doesn't even exist anymore.
[02:06:57.788 --> 02:06:59.289]  It's all spin.
[02:06:59.289 --> 02:07:01.270]  It's all moral relativism.
[02:07:01.270 --> 02:07:04.092]  Alright, let's talk to Kathy in Texas.
[02:07:04.092 --> 02:07:05.813]  You're on the air, Kathy, go ahead.
[02:07:05.813 --> 02:07:06.453]  Yes, thank you.
[02:07:06.453 --> 02:07:11.936]  Good afternoon, Alex, Mr. Buchanan, and I appreciate you accepting my call.
[02:07:13.281 --> 02:07:19.767]  Alex, I have all of your videos with the exception of one, and they're unbelievable.
[02:07:19.767 --> 02:07:21.408]  Thank you.
[02:07:21.408 --> 02:07:25.511]  But true, and I'm amazed at what's going on in our country.
[02:07:25.511 --> 02:07:30.655]  I go to many public places where there really isn't any access to VCRs.
[02:07:30.655 --> 02:07:37.701]  My question is, do you record your radio talk show guests on cassette tapes?
[02:07:38.735 --> 02:07:44.197]  The network sells them on cassette and CD.
[02:07:44.197 --> 02:07:47.379]  Go to GCNlive.com, there's a phone number there.
[02:07:47.379 --> 02:07:52.581]  Or, some of the best interviews, we post them on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:07:52.581 --> 02:07:54.482]  This one will be posted.
[02:07:54.482 --> 02:07:58.643]  Okay, I don't have an internet, so which would be the best way to go?
[02:07:58.643 --> 02:08:00.104]  To call the network.
[02:08:00.104 --> 02:08:01.164]  Call the network.
[02:08:01.164 --> 02:08:02.325]  That number is...
[02:08:03.174 --> 02:08:07.197]  You can get like a whole month recorded on MP3 for twenty-something dollars.
[02:08:07.197 --> 02:08:09.179]  I mean, hundreds of hours.
[02:08:09.179 --> 02:08:13.643]  Well, I would like to get all, as many as I can of your cassettes of your value tapes.
[02:08:13.643 --> 02:08:19.248]  Yeah, it costs more because they have to do individual hours on individual cassettes or CDs, but you can call them.
[02:08:19.248 --> 02:08:23.151]  In fact, John's running the show, not John Buchanan, but the other John.
[02:08:23.151 --> 02:08:26.674]  John, can you give me that particular extension of the network for folks that want to buy tapes?
[02:08:28.419 --> 02:08:30.180]  It's extension 193.
[02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:30.401]  193.
[02:08:30.401 --> 02:08:33.083]  Let me give you that toll free number to call.
[02:08:33.083 --> 02:08:35.324]  Extension 193 once you call it.
[02:08:35.324 --> 02:08:41.049]  It's 877.
[02:08:41.049 --> 02:08:41.409]  877.
[02:08:41.409 --> 02:08:42.290]  996.
[02:08:42.290 --> 02:08:42.310]  996.
[02:08:42.310 --> 02:08:42.330]  4327.
[02:08:42.330 --> 02:08:44.271]  4327.
[02:08:44.271 --> 02:08:48.555]  I would especially like this cassette of your program today.
[02:08:48.555 --> 02:08:53.358]  There's a lot to cover and go over and there's just so much valuable information.
[02:08:53.358 --> 02:08:53.879]  Well thank you.
[02:08:54.438 --> 02:09:01.767]  And I really appreciate it and God bless you and your good work and your efforts and keep up the strength and all you can do.
[02:09:01.767 --> 02:09:03.809]  We're behind you.
[02:09:03.809 --> 02:09:09.756]  Even though we little people don't seem to come out of the woodwork fast enough, but we are behind you and we'll do all I can.
[02:09:09.756 --> 02:09:14.461]  I want to play these cassettes in public places such as restaurants where they don't have access to VCRs.
[02:09:16.127 --> 02:09:17.628]  and other areas.
[02:09:17.628 --> 02:09:27.212]  Start a little group and once every two weeks meet for three hours at the library and everybody educate each other and share information and get plans of action.
[02:09:27.212 --> 02:09:29.853]  Thanks for the call Kathy, that was a great call John.
[02:09:29.853 --> 02:09:38.316]  Absolutely Kathy and God bless you for that sentiment and God bless you for being that creative to think of doing that in public places because
[02:09:38.817 --> 02:09:43.123]  We can expand the awareness base exponentially in the next five weeks.
[02:09:43.123 --> 02:09:47.329]  The election is five weeks from tomorrow, and the future belongs to us.
[02:09:47.329 --> 02:09:48.731]  We can change history, Kathy.
[02:09:50.154 --> 02:09:59.684]  Now again, John, you've written and talked about how Kerry is part of this same globalist cabal, but by the election coming up, what are you saying, John?
[02:09:59.684 --> 02:10:09.553]  Well, that also is in my book, Fixing America, and I would encourage your listeners to buy the book when it comes out through my website or at my events on the tour.
[02:10:09.553 --> 02:10:13.237]  But I'm an equal opportunity trasher, Alex.
[02:10:13.237 --> 02:10:13.898]  I trash both
[02:10:14.318 --> 02:10:15.119]  We're good to go.
[02:10:30.274 --> 02:10:35.679]  Who wouldn't understand the needs of a common American citizen if he bumped into them in a back alley.
[02:10:35.679 --> 02:10:40.222]  And that's why I believe that the country is in such a state of crisis.
[02:10:40.222 --> 02:10:54.074]  We face an election where on one side we have the descendant of Nazi war criminals who wants to declare martial law and suspend the Constitution for all intents and purposes, who is a mass murderer from the attacks of 9-1-1.
[02:10:54.074 --> 02:10:55.195]  Stay there, we got a break.
[02:11:02.090 --> 02:11:06.600]  Police State 3 details the architecture, goals and operations of the New World Order.
[02:11:06.600 --> 02:11:11.230]  There is a chance to use this disaster with a New World Order.
[02:11:11.230 --> 02:11:12.392]  New World Order.
[02:11:13.172 --> 02:11:14.153]  Panama.
[02:11:14.153 --> 02:11:18.437]  The film documents dozens of confirmed cases of government-sponsored terrorism worldwide.
[02:11:18.437 --> 02:11:25.503]  We rip the Sinister Patriot Act legislation one and two apart, piece by piece, and reveal the arrogance of what Ashcroft has to say about your liberty.
[02:11:25.503 --> 02:11:27.865]  You will lose your liberty.
[02:11:27.865 --> 02:11:38.154]  Homeland Security, executive orders, forced vaccinations, the new prison economy, the Total Information Society, the Pan-American Union, federal gun grabs, government-run white slavery rings, and much, much more.
[02:11:40.882 --> 02:11:44.364]  And my new two and a half hour video, Police Day 3, is for you!

[02:12:10.138 --> 02:12:16.606]  The revolutionary Berkey Light removes pathogenic bacteria, cysts, parasites, and harmful or unwanted chemicals.
[02:12:16.826 --> 02:12:18.387]  ...to below detectable levels.
[02:12:18.387 --> 02:12:22.551]  It also removes foul tastes and odors like that rotten egg smell of sulfide.
[02:12:22.551 --> 02:12:29.297]  And it reduces nitrates and unhealthy minerals like lead and mercury while leaving in the healthful and nutritional minerals your body needs.
[02:12:29.297 --> 02:12:35.022]  The Berkey Light is so powerful it can purify raw, untreated water from remote lakes, streams, and stagnant ponds.
[02:12:35.022 --> 02:12:42.168]  The Berkey Light is transparent and glows in the dark with its rechargeable LED lighting system so it can be used as a night light or camp light.

[02:14:02.270 --> 02:14:04.672]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:14:04.672 --> 02:14:08.395]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:14:08.395 --> 02:14:14.500]  Look, what we're dealing with is evil people, whether they're black or white, old or young, and they serve the new world order, they're evil.
[02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:15.321]  Period.
[02:14:15.321 --> 02:14:17.503]  There's just different degrees of that evil.
[02:14:17.503 --> 02:14:19.024]  Are they conscious or unconscious?
[02:14:19.024 --> 02:14:24.909]  I mean, take John Shelley Cachevely, the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff under Clinton, whose dad ran death camps in Poland.
[02:14:24.909 --> 02:14:25.410]  That's admitted.
[02:14:26.109 --> 02:14:33.735]  And then you've got Madeleine Albright, whose father was the chief communist in one of those major satellite states.
[02:14:33.735 --> 02:14:50.749]  And it's all admitted, and they looted a bunch of people, and then they ran, once the Nazis came after them, they ran out of Czechoslovakia into the Balkans, and then they saved them, and then later they attacked the very people that helped them.
[02:14:51.727 --> 02:14:56.812]  So it doesn't matter whether you're a Nazi or a Communist or a Fascist, whatever.
[02:14:56.812 --> 02:15:05.920]  If you are a thug and you want power and control, and you're part of one of these little gangs, they all team up together.
[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:08.462]  And they use the threat of terrorism to get that done.
[02:15:08.462 --> 02:15:10.444]  That's the current threat.
[02:15:10.444 --> 02:15:12.926]  If you want to get my films, I've made eleven films.
[02:15:12.926 --> 02:15:16.770]  The newest film, American Dictators, documenting the staged election of 2004, is out.
[02:15:18.813 --> 02:15:19.554]  90 minutes long, 1995.
[02:15:19.554 --> 02:15:25.861]  I've got my 9-11 The Road to Tyranny, my Masters of Terror films on September 11th, the best out there.
[02:15:25.861 --> 02:15:29.224]  You're authorized to make copies of them for non-profit educational purposes.
[02:15:29.224 --> 02:15:33.128]  I carry a bunch of other 9-11 books and videos by other researchers.
[02:15:33.128 --> 02:15:39.255]  They're available through InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or you can watch all of them if you're a member at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[02:15:43.717 --> 02:15:48.798]  Or just write to me, Alex Jones, at 3001 South Lamar, Suite 100, Austin, TX 78704.
[02:15:48.798 --> 02:15:50.778]  Again, that number if you missed it, 888-253-3139.
[02:15:50.778 --> 02:15:53.579]  I want to take a few final calls here, John Buchanan.
[02:15:53.579 --> 02:15:54.799]  I want to thank you for joining us.
[02:16:10.423 --> 02:16:13.704]  You described the choice of Bush, now give us the choice of Kerry.
[02:16:14.139 --> 02:16:16.359]  Officer, I'm glad you're giving me one more chance, Alex.
[02:16:16.359 --> 02:16:17.280]  Go ahead.
[02:16:17.280 --> 02:16:24.361]  With five weeks to go toward the election, we the people and your listening audience can give John Kerry a choice.
[02:16:24.361 --> 02:16:32.383]  And that is, will he speak out publicly about these Bush-Nazi documents and the attacks of 9-1-1 and the Zogby Poll?
[02:16:32.383 --> 02:16:42.885]  And if he has the courage to acknowledge the Zogby Poll in a major campaign speech or in the debates this week, and if he will demand a congressional inquiry of the attacks of 9-1-1,
[02:16:44.085 --> 02:16:52.667]  And if he will go public with the Nazi past of the Bush family and their ownership of Auschwitz, then perhaps he's fit to be President of the United States.
[02:16:52.667 --> 02:16:53.707]  Gotta stop you right there.
[02:16:53.707 --> 02:16:54.647]  That isn't gonna happen.
[02:16:54.647 --> 02:16:55.567]  He's showing bones.
[02:16:55.567 --> 02:16:56.468]  It's staged.
[02:16:56.468 --> 02:16:57.928]  The debates are totally scripted.
[02:16:57.928 --> 02:16:58.868]  That's admitted.
[02:16:58.868 --> 02:17:03.369]  Let's go ahead and talk to, uh... Oh, up next here is James in Rhode Island.
[02:17:03.369 --> 02:17:04.429]  Go ahead, James.
[02:17:04.429 --> 02:17:05.570]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:17:05.570 --> 02:17:05.790]  Good.
[02:17:05.790 --> 02:17:07.210]  Turn your radio off.
[02:17:07.210 --> 02:17:08.290]  I'll turn the radio off.
[02:17:08.290 --> 02:17:09.350]  Anyway, that's fine.
[02:17:09.350 --> 02:17:10.591]  Turn it off.
[02:17:10.591 --> 02:17:11.451]  Go ahead, sir.
[02:17:11.451 --> 02:17:11.831]  Sorry, Alex.
[02:17:12.806 --> 02:17:17.268]  I want to God bless you and God bless everyone at Infowars.com for doing what you're doing.
[02:17:17.268 --> 02:17:17.689]  Thank you.
[02:17:17.689 --> 02:17:19.450]  I think you're doing an excellent job.
[02:17:19.450 --> 02:17:20.810]  I listen to your tapes all the time.
[02:17:20.810 --> 02:17:24.492]  It doesn't seem like I can get the bell without listening to your tapes.
[02:17:24.492 --> 02:17:31.656]  You seem to be the only hope that Rhode Islanders have out here because we really don't know too much about what's going on.
[02:17:31.656 --> 02:17:35.058]  A lot of people are waking up in Rhode Island because of you.
[02:17:35.058 --> 02:17:41.101]  And I just want to tell you that a lot of people in Rhode Island are very, very fearful of what's coming down the pike.
[02:17:42.168 --> 02:17:45.251]  I'm not an expert on the New Orleans myself, but I do read a lot about it.
[02:17:45.251 --> 02:17:53.300]  I have heard that Spritz Springmeyer was imprisoned for his book, Bloodlines of Wim Laddy.
[02:17:53.300 --> 02:17:53.800]  Yes.
[02:17:53.800 --> 02:17:57.584]  And I think he is a very good patriot also.
[02:17:57.584 --> 02:18:01.248]  But I would like to know, Alex, what do people view
[02:18:04.016 --> 02:18:07.338]  We're out of time.
[02:18:07.338 --> 02:18:14.962]  Tell people, thanks for the call, beforehand that the Globalists stand to gain from the terror and have been behind the other events in the past.
[02:18:14.962 --> 02:18:16.403]  Know who has the motive.
[02:18:16.403 --> 02:18:18.905]  Get the word out on that now and they may back off.
[02:18:20.022 --> 02:18:22.644]  John Buchanan, I look forward to talking to you again soon.
[02:18:22.644 --> 02:18:23.745]  Thank you for coming on with us.
[02:18:23.745 --> 02:18:25.226]  Thank you, Alex, very much.
[02:18:25.226 --> 02:18:26.306]  God bless you and your listeners.
[02:18:26.306 --> 02:18:26.947]  Thanks a lot.
[02:18:26.947 --> 02:18:27.167]  Great.
[02:18:27.167 --> 02:18:29.769]  Good having you on for two and a half hours today.
[02:18:29.769 --> 02:18:35.592]  We'll be back tonight, 9 to midnight Central Standard Time on the shortwave at 3210 and during the day at 9475.
[02:18:35.592 --> 02:18:44.538]  I want to thank all the sponsors, the affiliates, the listeners, the folks running the broadcast, and number one, God, Yahweh.
[02:18:44.538 --> 02:18:45.399]  Take care, my friends.
