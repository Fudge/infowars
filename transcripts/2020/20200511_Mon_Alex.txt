[00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:11.577]  So what Susan Wojcicki and Zuckerberg are doing is they're facilitating and advancing and making possible fascism.
[00:00:12.097 --> 00:00:13.498]  And what does that make them?
[00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:19.322]  Gates is absolutely fascistic in what he's doing.
[00:00:19.923 --> 00:00:21.023]  Who is this guy?
[00:00:21.604 --> 00:00:29.009]  He's a bloke that's come through selling software and now suddenly he's dictating global health policy.
[00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.191]  It's ridiculous.
[00:00:31.412 --> 00:00:32.332]  It's crazy.
[00:00:32.392 --> 00:00:33.754]  It's Alice in Wonderland.
[00:00:34.194 --> 00:00:41.540]  These people are creating a fascist global state and they need to be called out on that.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.785]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:53.010]  Well, everything has come clearly into view.
[00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.213]  We have a crystal clear image of exactly what the globalists are up to.
[00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:04.715]  And yes, it's overwhelming at many levels and quite frightening, but we have a chance to stop it if we take action now.
[00:01:05.736 --> 00:01:08.258]  And we've not been caught flat-footed by the world government.
[00:01:08.918 --> 00:01:17.404]  If you're a radio listener, well, you're not having to look at me right now, but I am wearing the Bill Gates uniform that now Mark Zuckerberg wears.
[00:01:17.524 --> 00:01:20.126]  It is a pink cashmere sweater.
[00:01:21.351 --> 00:01:28.474]  With a white collared shirt to look like Mr. Rogers or to look non-threatening.
[00:01:29.475 --> 00:01:35.398]  I've said it many times that if Hitler wore a pink uniform he would have won the war because he would have looked non-threatening.
[00:01:36.138 --> 00:01:43.642]  This is all done by image consultants and now you can notice that again Bill Gates is a front for the globalists so is Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:01:44.142 --> 00:01:48.204]  Now the two even appear on stage together wearing the pink uniform.
[00:01:49.502 --> 00:02:06.544]  And I think a week and a half ago when they had that record online stream at London Real with David Icke, over 1,300,000 viewers, outside of the YouTube, Twitter, Facebook combine, David Icke wore the Bill Gates uniform, I think to throw it back in their face.
[00:02:07.523 --> 00:02:15.830]  Maybe it was just a coincidence, but he's joining us in the third hour today, maybe a little bit in the fourth hour that Gerald Solentik takes over.
[00:02:16.331 --> 00:02:24.518]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us with big developments from the UK coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:33.565]  Okay, that said, you've noticed these stacks of articles and documents and things here in front of me, maybe with an overhead panning shot.
[00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:35.067]  This is not a prop.
[00:02:36.434 --> 00:02:38.255]  I have read over and looked at all of these.
[00:02:38.756 --> 00:02:51.105]  This is enough to do 20 hours straight, not ever going back over one piece of information again, but I'm going to do my best to condense all of this down today, but the quickening is certainly here in many, many ways.
[00:02:52.526 --> 00:02:58.551]  Out of everything we have to cover, the most important is the big picture.
[00:02:59.738 --> 00:03:01.659]  COVID-19 is a hysteria.
[00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:20.166]  It is designed to usher in total surveillance, total control, medical tyranny, forced inoculation, and the tracking systems to make sure you've submitted to inoculation that is going to be used as the basis of a global social credit score and the cashless society with all the nightmare authoritarian ramifications.
[00:03:20.246 --> 00:03:24.107]  Because of course, many say, well, what do I have to hide?
[00:03:24.187 --> 00:03:28.969]  Many people will say, I'm going to go along with the system.
[00:03:31.015 --> 00:03:35.417]  But when you go along with the system and it's predatory, that doesn't get you ahead.
[00:03:35.477 --> 00:03:45.341]  If you were a sheep and there was a slaughter going on and you were conscious and knew that there was a slaughter, complying with going into the slaughterhouse is not brave.
[00:03:45.381 --> 00:03:46.421]  It's not altruistic.
[00:03:46.501 --> 00:03:47.482]  It's not stunning.
[00:03:47.542 --> 00:03:48.842]  It's not cool.
[00:03:49.242 --> 00:03:50.823]  It's stupid.
[00:03:52.424 --> 00:03:55.345]  And so that's exactly what's going on here.
[00:03:56.345 --> 00:04:04.228]  Now the big takeaway, well, everybody's obsessed with General Flynn being exonerated and obsessed with, oh, a couple people might have coronavirus in the White House.
[00:04:04.308 --> 00:04:05.229]  Oh, it's so scary.
[00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:08.570]  Oh, the coronavirus is making a comeback.
[00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.552]  Funny, it never reached one-tenth of what they said it would, one-twentieth.
[00:04:14.272 --> 00:04:16.713]  But now they add all death statistics into the column.
[00:04:16.933 --> 00:04:18.694]  They can, oh, look, it came back.
[00:04:18.754 --> 00:04:19.394]  A hundred dead.
[00:04:19.474 --> 00:04:20.394]  Oh, a thousand dead.
[00:04:20.715 --> 00:04:21.275]  It came back.
[00:04:22.458 --> 00:04:24.180]  Almost everyone's had two, three surgeries.
[00:04:25.241 --> 00:04:28.044]  Heart failure, cancer, over 80 years old.
[00:04:28.725 --> 00:04:35.112]  But none of those facts, none of those realities matter because it's so fun to get into the hysteria.
[00:04:36.613 --> 00:04:41.639]  While the real fact is the third world is completely in cardiac arrest financially.
[00:04:43.117 --> 00:04:46.919]  Going into total starvation, and we are going into collapse here as well.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:58.947]  And so just like I told you 13 weeks ago, back in mid-January, that this COVID thing was the big globalist move to lock down society and get ready, and it took five, six weeks to see that happen.
[00:04:59.587 --> 00:05:00.288]  I'm telling you!
[00:05:01.271 --> 00:05:04.314]  A lot of folks are like, hey, a lot of folks are waking up to the COVID hysteria.
[00:05:04.354 --> 00:05:06.756]  Hey, this thing might dissipate.
[00:05:06.957 --> 00:05:10.200]  Oh no, they have already triggered the global depression.
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:23.112]  And unless they get the blame for it, the globalists, they're going to continue to press the global depression while posing as saviors, giving us all the reasons we need to take forced inoculations and national ID cards to be able to go outside again.
[00:05:23.312 --> 00:05:24.433]  It's called being held hostage.
[00:05:25.558 --> 00:05:31.060]  Oh my gosh, we're told that Tim Downing Street had to quarantine people in the last few months and have lockdown.
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:42.525]  And we're also told that up to eight Secret Service agents have tested positive for COVID and the President is refusing to quarantine and so is the Vice President.
[00:05:42.565 --> 00:05:43.905]  What incredible traitors!
[00:05:45.866 --> 00:05:53.749]  Meanwhile, flights still bringing 15,000 people a day into the UK without virus testing, including travelers from China, Italy and the US.
[00:05:54.622 --> 00:06:05.788]  Oh, but you've got to stay in your home, and they've got a national poll out showing that 9 out of 10 in the UK want lockdown to carry on.
[00:06:07.148 --> 00:06:12.551]  Because they are such incredible heroes saving lives.
[00:06:13.332 --> 00:06:18.954]  Stay home, wear a mask, don't go outside and save lives.
[00:06:19.775 --> 00:06:21.336]  It's like you're in World War II.
[00:06:23.231 --> 00:06:26.034]  said Tom Hanks in a video yesterday.
[00:06:26.054 --> 00:06:28.096]  You all the heroes.
[00:06:28.196 --> 00:06:30.138]  Incredibly devastating.
[00:06:30.158 --> 00:06:42.871]  And as I've always said, if Hitler wore a pink uniform, he would have won World War II because people would have bowed down and said, somebody wearing pink is nothing but good.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.022]  That's why Bill and Melinda Gates always wear pink in public.
[00:06:47.083 --> 00:06:56.751]  It's why Mark Zuckerberg's gotten rid of his characteristic gray or black t-shirt and he now wears pink sweaters under his mentor Bill Gates.
[00:06:58.113 --> 00:07:01.216]  And see, I'm wearing a pink sweater if you're a TV viewer.
[00:07:01.616 --> 00:07:04.258]  I'm wearing the Bill Gates uniform.
[00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:08.963]  So it doesn't matter I get up on TV and say I want to reduce the world population.
[00:07:10.367 --> 00:07:12.209]  Doesn't matter if I say I want death panels.
[00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:15.093]  Doesn't matter if I say I want more childhood death.
[00:07:15.713 --> 00:07:17.656]  Doesn't matter if I run Planned Parenthood.
[00:07:17.856 --> 00:07:21.801]  Doesn't matter if I've been caught sterilizing people all over the world.
[00:07:22.521 --> 00:07:24.484]  He's wearing a pink shirt!
[00:07:26.954 --> 00:07:29.316]  After all, we know anyone wearing a pink shirt's gotta be good.
[00:07:29.736 --> 00:07:35.960]  Warren Buffett more and more wears pink shirts and almost always poses with an ice cream cone.
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:36.780]  Look!
[00:07:37.141 --> 00:07:38.201]  Ice cream cone!
[00:07:38.221 --> 00:07:40.403]  And it's like, oh, ice cream!
[00:07:40.443 --> 00:07:41.624]  He's like a little boy.
[00:07:41.644 --> 00:07:43.845]  He's like a little child.
[00:07:43.885 --> 00:07:46.527]  He doesn't launder hundreds of billions in drug money.
[00:07:46.707 --> 00:07:48.548]  Got caught doing it in 2010.
[00:07:51.576 --> 00:07:57.040]  No, Warren Buffett wears pink and he has an ice cream cone.
[00:07:58.582 --> 00:08:01.224]  David Icke is going to be joining us in the third hour.
[00:08:01.524 --> 00:08:12.653]  He got massively censored and banned off the internet for questioning COVID-19 and pointing out they're putting deaths from a bunch of other diseases in the same column in Europe, the US, in Canada, in Australia.
[00:08:12.873 --> 00:08:16.216]  It's all globally run by the standards of the WHO.
[00:08:17.837 --> 00:08:20.499]  And when San Antonio
[00:08:21.667 --> 00:08:25.890]  Passed a law last Thursday saying you'll be arrested if you say Chinese virus.
[00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:28.952]  They said because the W.H.O.
[00:08:29.052 --> 00:08:30.913]  says it doesn't come from China.
[00:08:32.234 --> 00:08:33.415]  And I guess the W.H.O.
[00:08:33.455 --> 00:08:35.557]  could say the moon is made of cheese.
[00:08:35.677 --> 00:08:39.640]  So, David Icke had his little nod to Bill Gates with his little pink shirt.
[00:08:40.280 --> 00:08:42.341]  Well, now I am wearing the pink shirt.
[00:08:43.682 --> 00:08:46.524]  Just to all show that we can be trusted.
[00:08:46.604 --> 00:08:47.905]  Look, I'm wearing pink.
[00:08:49.346 --> 00:08:50.067]  Let's get serious.
[00:08:52.110 --> 00:09:03.341]  If you go back to the middle of January and we saw the buildings being locked down, people being welded into their homes, the drones, women being shot at checkpoints, and I came on air and I said, folks, the UN's running this.
[00:09:03.801 --> 00:09:05.383]  They're going to hype this here domestically.
[00:09:06.003 --> 00:09:11.628]  When Trump doesn't respond and tries to say it's a hoax, they're going to blame him and say every death is his fault.
[00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.153]  So Trump has to at least come out and take control of it.
[00:09:17.304 --> 00:09:19.165]  Or the NIH will be in complete control.
[00:09:19.205 --> 00:09:21.667]  The states and counties and blue cities will be in control.
[00:09:22.028 --> 00:09:27.752]  They'll create the precedent for total complete lockdown outside of the federal government's control.
[00:09:28.572 --> 00:09:38.940]  So Trump's got to jump in, take control of it to ride the tiger, and then at a proper time, come out and expose the fake numbers and try to turn the economy back on.
[00:09:39.801 --> 00:09:42.263]  Because the public wanted to buy into the hoax.
[00:09:42.723 --> 00:09:46.706]  They saw the science fiction dystopic images out of China, all choreographed.
[00:09:47.694 --> 00:09:49.935]  And now we know exactly what happened.
[00:09:49.955 --> 00:09:51.616]  We'll be breaking it all down today.
[00:09:53.077 --> 00:09:56.059]  But what's the real agenda behind COVID-19?
[00:09:56.379 --> 00:10:07.146]  Global cashless society surveilling everything you do, tied to the fact that you have been inoculated with a digital ink tattoo that Villamona Gates have patented under the skin.
[00:10:08.006 --> 00:10:17.072]  Now they've officially put out those patents, but the media will look at another patent they have for a bracelet, a watch, or a chip to track you in live time using wireless
[00:10:18.629 --> 00:10:24.578]  Patent 2020-06-06-06, and they'll go, oh, that's not a chip necessarily, it's fake news.
[00:10:25.059 --> 00:10:31.770]  Even though they have the other MIT push patent with Bill and Melinda Gates saying it's under the skin.
[00:10:33.476 --> 00:10:35.017]  That all got put to bed yesterday.
[00:10:35.537 --> 00:10:49.726]  Benjamin Netanyahu came out and said he has Shin Bet, the internal Israeli security force, looking at making every child in Israel take an implantable chip for COVID-19, of course, to make sure you stay separated.
[00:10:51.026 --> 00:10:53.708]  That, by the way, is the Jerusalem Post.
[00:10:54.128 --> 00:10:58.111]  Benjamin Netanyahu suggests microchipping kids slammed by experts.
[00:11:00.052 --> 00:11:01.733]  Elion Musk says put them in your brain.
[00:11:03.539 --> 00:11:05.399]  So, that's where we are.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:16.122]  Any excuse for COVID-19, and now you're locked down, you're a hero for not leaving your house in the UK, but 15,000 people a day flying in totally untested.
[00:11:16.462 --> 00:11:30.105]  It's all complete theater training you that you are obsolete and that you are not essential for the robot takeover, the end of the carbon-based life form, the rise of the silicon life form, as all the top globalists say they believe is about to happen.
[00:11:30.905 --> 00:11:32.346]  But the big news when we come back
[00:11:33.351 --> 00:11:35.572]  It's much worse than you're being told.
[00:11:35.692 --> 00:11:37.853]  Very powerful article on InfoWars.com.
[00:11:40.094 --> 00:11:45.456]  Laying all of what's really going on out with the economy.
[00:11:48.157 --> 00:11:48.458]  U.S.
[00:11:48.578 --> 00:11:50.518]  risking a second wave and depression.
[00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:53.960]  Mark Zandi says, that's right.
[00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:56.901]  The wave was tiny compared to what they said it would be.
[00:11:57.261 --> 00:12:00.803]  But now because they count all deaths as COVID-19, they're going to hype it up again.
[00:12:02.523 --> 00:12:07.026]  At the end of the summer and say the lockdown can never stop or all of you not locking down our murderers.
[00:12:07.407 --> 00:12:14.892]  And then the hospitals will all have the testing kits now that test positive if you've ever had the flu or the coronavirus in the last decade.
[00:12:15.333 --> 00:12:17.294]  Coronavirus most common cold virus there is.
[00:12:17.755 --> 00:12:19.376]  And so there'll be even more hysteria.
[00:12:21.638 --> 00:12:33.184]  And more finger-pointing and more mask-wearing, ensuring a long, dark depression they believe will remove President Trump, bankrupt the Western world, and put us fully under servitude, like the Third World.
[00:12:33.685 --> 00:12:38.907]  That's why Bill Gates gets so excited when he was on with Fareed Zarkaria, when they talk about total economic collapse.
[00:12:40.068 --> 00:12:50.554]  Because this means, with all their stolen wealth, when things collapse, they can buy everything up for pennies on the dollar, and then exercise total control over the population.
[00:12:52.639 --> 00:12:56.582]  That's why now it's so essential for all of us to become self-sufficient.
[00:12:56.682 --> 00:13:14.658]  And the first thing you can do is learn how to use a firearm to protect yourself in a defensive way, and to learn some basic defense moves, and to have water filtration, air filtration, and high-quality storable foods, all available, highest quality, ready to ship to you at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:13:14.758 --> 00:13:15.539]  And please don't forget,
[00:13:17.483 --> 00:13:21.184]  These aren't just great products you need that make your life better, that make you healthier.
[00:13:21.765 --> 00:13:32.529]  They also fund this operation, which is, as you can see, so important now that everybody else is getting censored and shut down unless they bend the knee to Bill Gates and say he's the Lord and Savior, like Jack Posobiec's done.
[00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:36.991]  Unless you bow to the New World Order, you will be taken off the main internet.
[00:13:37.471 --> 00:13:40.672]  That's why we have Band.Video.
[00:13:40.712 --> 00:13:42.133]  That's why we have InfoWars.com.
[00:13:42.153 --> 00:13:44.374]  That's why it's critical you share those links.
[00:13:45.629 --> 00:13:47.671]  We have the biggest sale yet of the year.
[00:13:50.114 --> 00:13:53.098]  Won't have a sale this big until Christmas.
[00:13:53.979 --> 00:13:56.102]  30 to 60% off across the board.
[00:13:56.162 --> 00:13:57.443]  It has to end this weekend.
[00:13:57.463 --> 00:14:03.490]  There'll still be a few things for sale next week, but this has to end because a lot of these items are very close to selling out.
[00:14:04.338 --> 00:14:05.740]  Ultimate Krill oil back in stock.
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.861]  So incredibly good for you.
[00:14:07.702 --> 00:14:08.844]  50% off in stock.
[00:14:08.864 --> 00:14:09.605]  Survival Shield X2.
[00:14:09.645 --> 00:14:10.946]  Been sold out for months now.
[00:14:10.966 --> 00:14:11.847]  Back in stock.

[00:15:08.134 --> 00:15:09.916]  We have the headlines today.
[00:15:10.236 --> 00:15:16.063]  California braces as coronavirus numbers explode.
[00:15:16.864 --> 00:15:18.085]  Dreaded comeback.
[00:15:18.206 --> 00:15:27.556]  Wuhan reports five new coronavirus cases, its highest surge in two months.
[00:15:29.096 --> 00:15:31.839]  Coronavirus spread accelerates in Germany.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:36.344]  Contagion within the White House would be catastrophic for U.S.
[00:15:36.424 --> 00:15:37.465]  national security.
[00:15:38.026 --> 00:15:42.891]  GOP senators worry Trump COVID-19 could cost them the majority.
[00:15:42.911 --> 00:15:51.020]  AP exclusive, doc show, top White House officials buried, CDC report.
[00:15:53.336 --> 00:16:00.762]  But depending on the graph, they're 50 to 10 times lower COVID-19 death rates than they predicted.
[00:16:00.782 --> 00:16:04.125]  And the very same groups now put out all these new fake numbers.
[00:16:04.525 --> 00:16:09.449]  And Trump's like, no, I'm not putting these numbers out predicting giant deaths and millions more cases.
[00:16:09.529 --> 00:16:12.471]  Because he goes, I don't trust your testing.
[00:16:13.092 --> 00:16:13.792]  Because he knows.
[00:16:14.833 --> 00:16:23.415]  Biologists in Australia and Africa and other areas have tested people and found that these tests are all wrong, the way they're designed.
[00:16:24.576 --> 00:16:31.398]  That's why, quote, Fauci at the NIH, remember, three months ago, approved unapproved tests from China.
[00:16:32.838 --> 00:16:36.759]  Because they want everyone to be positive so they can test everyone dying.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.401]  Look up the number, the average number of people that die daily on planet Earth.
[00:16:43.203 --> 00:16:43.663]  The estimate.
[00:16:44.423 --> 00:16:46.644]  Versus the average number that die every day in the United States.
[00:16:47.784 --> 00:16:48.684]  And they've got the graphs.
[00:16:48.824 --> 00:16:49.825]  Again, I keep harping on this.
[00:16:49.885 --> 00:16:57.547]  They move the dead that die of heart attacks and car wrecks and cancer and pneumonia over into the COVID column.
[00:16:58.387 --> 00:17:05.769]  And Berks admitted two months ago, and again a month ago, on the stand, on the stage, that they do that!
[00:17:07.749 --> 00:17:09.530]  This is conclusive.
[00:17:13.962 --> 00:17:16.965]  It's simply amazing.
[00:17:18.927 --> 00:17:21.730]  So the average number of deaths by world region.
[00:17:25.333 --> 00:17:26.674]  Wow.
[00:17:26.694 --> 00:17:29.117]  50 million deaths every year.
[00:17:31.519 --> 00:17:38.506]  And so I guess if they just, this is more than 50 million going up towards 60 million, I guess if they just count
[00:17:41.286 --> 00:17:42.187]  Everybody dying.
[00:17:42.267 --> 00:17:45.670]  Let's say 56 million people are going to die this year from COVID.
[00:17:47.912 --> 00:17:49.273]  That's fraction magic.
[00:17:49.293 --> 00:17:50.434]  That's statistic magic.
[00:17:51.836 --> 00:17:56.980]  But oh, I want to pull this article up from California Globe on April 14th.
[00:17:57.561 --> 00:18:01.725]  Experts significantly lower coronavirus death projections in California.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:11.064]  So then they lower them down to nothing, and then now that it's, oh, going up a little higher than they thought, once they lowered it down, now they say it's exploding.
[00:18:13.245 --> 00:18:17.147]  So first they say it's gonna be 100 feet tall, and they go, oh, actually it's gonna be a centimeter high.
[00:18:17.267 --> 00:18:18.948]  They go, oh, actually it's two centimeters high.
[00:18:18.968 --> 00:18:24.511]  And they play those games with you and I every single day.
[00:18:26.132 --> 00:18:27.613]  But there are reports coming out
[00:18:29.807 --> 00:18:42.032]  That Dr. Fauci's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, NIAID, funded the Communist Chinese government and was the main funder of the Wuhan Virus Laboratory.
[00:18:42.493 --> 00:18:47.335]  We reported that, of course, three months ago, but now it's in AP, it's in Reuters, it's in Newsweek.
[00:18:48.395 --> 00:18:49.256]  But does it matter?
[00:18:49.596 --> 00:18:52.757]  When you tune into CNN or MSNBC, they say it's fake news.
[00:18:54.198 --> 00:18:56.859]  So the very people that stand to make all this money off of it,
[00:18:57.927 --> 00:19:06.675]  The very people that stand to control our lives, that admit they want to depopulate us, are the ones now wanting to put these things in our bodies.
[00:19:07.276 --> 00:19:09.318]  People go, oh, no, Bill Gates is a philanthropist.
[00:19:10.419 --> 00:19:18.346]  Yeah, 20-something years ago, he put his $100-plus billion into a tax-free foundation with Warren and Buffett, so his companies all run profits.
[00:19:18.806 --> 00:19:22.850]  He keeps the profits and then only gives maybe 1% a year
[00:19:26.201 --> 00:19:32.822]  of the money into, quote, charity, which is sterilizing people and controlling the population.
[00:19:33.082 --> 00:19:41.244]  Here's a few clips of Bill Gates talking about childhood death and depopulation.
[00:19:41.264 --> 00:19:44.245]  And of course, we have clips of him talking about death panels, get rid of old people.
[00:19:44.945 --> 00:19:46.345]  Here's some of the things he said recently.
[00:19:47.065 --> 00:19:50.046]  We see a lot of things that are going very well.
[00:19:50.606 --> 00:19:52.426]  Things like reducing childhood death.
[00:19:53.166 --> 00:19:55.607]  Things like reducing childhood death.
[00:19:56.035 --> 00:19:58.779]  The economy is not going to be anything like it was.
[00:19:58.819 --> 00:20:01.383]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[00:20:01.843 --> 00:20:05.429]  People are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful this is.
[00:20:05.749 --> 00:20:11.798]  Let's watch that video one more time, where Bill Gates becomes visibly
[00:20:12.819 --> 00:20:25.191]  Joyful, excited, almost having an orgasm when Fareed Zarkaria, the other fellow globalist of the Bilderberg Group, on CNN talks about how horrible the economy is and how we better get used to it.
[00:20:25.712 --> 00:20:28.395]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[00:20:28.495 --> 00:20:34.421]  It's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how fruitful this is.
[00:20:37.222 --> 00:21:04.168]  Here we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they're most at risk of that and doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people and yet you don't have side effects you know if we have you know one in 10,000 side effects that's you know way more 700,000 you know people who will suffer from that so
[00:21:04.927 --> 00:21:17.992]  Really understanding the safety at gigantic scale across all age ranges, you know, pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities, it's very, very hard.
[00:21:18.032 --> 00:21:32.698]  And that actual decision of, okay, let's go and give this vaccine to the entire world, governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on.
[00:21:33.198 --> 00:21:47.624]  Well, Bill, since you tried to warn us about this pandemic and we didn't listen, what's the next thing you're warning us about that's going to happen five years from now that we're not listening to at the present?
[00:21:48.851 --> 00:21:51.934]  Well, I didn't want to be right.
[00:21:52.014 --> 00:21:54.337]  What I wanted to do was... I understand.
[00:21:54.397 --> 00:21:55.738]  I'm not saying you won.
[00:21:56.278 --> 00:21:57.139]  Everybody loses.
[00:21:57.199 --> 00:21:57.980]  Nobody wins with us.
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.803]  And I'm not saying that this is not an end zone dance.
[00:22:01.243 --> 00:22:06.248]  I'm just saying, what else are we not listening to that we need to take action on now?
[00:22:09.588 --> 00:22:17.395]  The idea of a bioterrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario because there, a pathogen with a high death rate would be picked.
[00:22:17.415 --> 00:22:35.672]  Now the good news is, not trying to depress you, it's tough enough right now, that most of the work we're going to do to be ready for Pandemic 2, I call this Pandemic 1, most of the work we'll do to be ready for that are also the things we need to do to minimize the threat of
[00:22:36.052 --> 00:22:36.652]  Stop right there.
[00:22:36.832 --> 00:22:39.093]  Folks, it's all in Event 201.
[00:22:39.213 --> 00:22:41.074]  It's all in lockstep, the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:22:41.554 --> 00:22:47.617]  This is just putting the handcuffs on you and locking you down and getting you ready for the national ID, the global ID, the implantable chip.
[00:22:48.137 --> 00:22:57.961]  Then the terrorists strike, but thank God Bill Gates is there to make sure you take the next shot that lowers your immunity even more so that the next binary weapon they release does kill you and your family.
[00:22:58.181 --> 00:22:58.902]  And that is his plan.
[00:22:59.942 --> 00:23:04.125]  And they'll probably kill me or put me in prison for doing this, but I'm telling the truth, so you know who killed you at least.
[00:23:04.445 --> 00:23:06.466]  Once you're dying, just remember who did it to you, okay?
[00:23:06.706 --> 00:23:07.247]  Alright, thanks.
[00:23:09.068 --> 00:23:14.251]  Well, there's a new article that just went live at newswars.com and infowars.com by Ron Paul.
[00:23:15.271 --> 00:23:19.974]  Ron Paul, authoritarians using coronavirus fear to destroy America.
[00:23:21.035 --> 00:23:24.817]  His next article will be, the sky is blue at high noon in Arizona.
[00:23:26.798 --> 00:23:27.799]  Yes, it's all true.
[00:23:28.868 --> 00:23:29.668]  Another key report.
[00:23:30.128 --> 00:23:33.090]  President Trump's betting on you needs to be seen, needs to be shared.
[00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:35.470]  Only way the dog hunts is you take action.
[00:23:36.451 --> 00:23:40.752]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us for the rest of the hour with Summit.News.
[00:23:40.792 --> 00:23:54.938]  Wanted to get Paul on because we see the UK flying in 15,000 people a day with no virus testing, including travelers from China, Italy, and the US, three of the supposedly hardest hit areas.
[00:23:56.418 --> 00:23:57.819]  But then you're not supposed to leave.
[00:23:58.854 --> 00:23:59.415]  Your houses.
[00:23:59.435 --> 00:24:02.038]  He wrote another article for Infowars.com.
[00:24:02.099 --> 00:24:05.363]  Thousands of people are dying at home due to the lockdown.
[00:24:07.186 --> 00:24:11.111]  Meanwhile, Poll finds that 9 out of 10 in the UK want lockdown to carry on.
[00:24:12.861 --> 00:24:27.531]  We'll be looking at those reports with Paul Joseph Watson and ask where he thinks this is going because we see numbers out of the UK at least 20 times, 30 times, depending on the study, lower than what they said the death rate would be.
[00:24:28.071 --> 00:24:29.472]  Same thing in Canada.
[00:24:29.972 --> 00:24:30.933]  Same thing in the US.
[00:24:30.973 --> 00:24:31.853]  Same thing in Australia.
[00:24:31.893 --> 00:24:32.634]  Same thing in Germany.
[00:24:33.094 --> 00:24:37.157]  But they call it explosions in cases.
[00:24:37.337 --> 00:24:39.158]  Five new coronavirus cases.
[00:24:40.599 --> 00:24:43.081]  In Wuhan, the most deadly in months!
[00:24:43.181 --> 00:24:44.642]  It's the end of the world!
[00:24:46.084 --> 00:24:48.686]  Coronavirus spreads in Germany and accelerates.
[00:24:49.366 --> 00:24:54.570]  No, the truth is, they're counting all the deaths from other things as COVID-19.
[00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:55.571]  They admit the tests are fake.
[00:24:56.172 --> 00:25:03.457]  A major biologist, the president of Tanzania, sent off a papaya and a goat to the national testing lab run by the UN, and they found it had coronavirus.
[00:25:04.562 --> 00:25:06.804]  So now we know it's about shutting down the West.
[00:25:07.384 --> 00:25:09.025]  It's about making sure we lose that trade war.
[00:25:09.065 --> 00:25:10.967]  It's about bringing in the national and global IDs.
[00:25:11.307 --> 00:25:16.170]  It's about the forced inoculations Netanyahu proposes, implantable chips for all the Israeli children.
[00:25:16.911 --> 00:25:17.992]  This is the dam breaking.
[00:25:18.032 --> 00:25:19.273]  This is the globalist takeover.
[00:25:19.653 --> 00:25:21.735]  Paul Joseph Watson from London.
[00:25:22.634 --> 00:25:33.721]  Describe what it's like to be in the month number two of the lockdown and the Tom Hanks and others are describing it like winning World War Two, everyone's heroes for staying in their houses.
[00:25:33.741 --> 00:25:39.945]  Is this true that nine out of 10 folks in the UK want to want to stay locked in their houses, buried alive?
[00:25:41.894 --> 00:25:42.995]  Yes, it's true.
[00:25:43.055 --> 00:25:48.720]  According to the polls, Alex, vast support for the lockdown to continue even beyond July.
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.444]  And I bet if you ask a lot of these people, they probably just want it to continue permanently, Alex.
[00:25:54.005 --> 00:25:57.148]  Mainly because they're getting paid by the government.
[00:25:57.208 --> 00:26:00.451]  This is like an insight into what universal basic income might be.
[00:26:01.095 --> 00:26:13.964]  They're happy to take 80% of their payment from the government to stay at home, to sit on their backsides and do nothing, even though there's probably not going to be much of an economy to come back to, and even though this whole thing
[00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.671]  is costing more lives than it is saving.
[00:26:18.112 --> 00:26:22.774]  We were told that we had to endure this lockdown Alex, which by the way I support at the start.
[00:26:22.814 --> 00:26:26.276]  I could see the sense in limited lockdown for a short period of time.
[00:26:26.616 --> 00:26:31.558]  We were told we needed to do it to stay at home, save lives and protect the NHS.
[00:26:32.158 --> 00:26:44.024]  Okay, the NHS, National Health Service, the overspill hospitals they built to deal with the coronavirus because they thought and they told us the hospitals would be completely overwhelmed like they were in Italy.
[00:26:45.483 --> 00:26:47.005]  Half of them didn't even open.
[00:26:47.045 --> 00:26:48.766]  They're closing down the remaining ones.
[00:26:49.066 --> 00:26:54.331]  Acute hospital beds across the United Kingdom are four times emptier than normal.
[00:26:54.751 --> 00:26:55.532]  And why is that?
[00:26:55.812 --> 00:27:03.238]  Because many of the people who are staying at home are cancer victims, heart attack victims and stroke victims.
[00:27:03.298 --> 00:27:05.420]  And you mentioned the article which we put out today.
[00:27:06.798 --> 00:27:18.132]  At least 10,000 excess deaths already due to people staying at home and not going into hospital for treatment, either because the treatment's not available or because they're scared of the coronavirus.
[00:27:18.513 --> 00:27:24.320]  You have cancer experts, the professor of cancer at King's College University, Richard Sullivan,
[00:27:25.094 --> 00:27:32.039]  Saying there will be more excess cancer deaths than total coronavirus deaths across the United Kingdom.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:44.929]  And in fact, an NHS consultant, Professor Carol Sikora, has said that there will be 50,000 excess deaths from cancer as a result of screenings being suspended in the UK.
[00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:52.015]  Let's bear in mind, Alex, around, I think it's the latest numbers, about 32,000 COVID deaths in the UK.
[00:27:52.115 --> 00:27:53.136]  But as you said, we know
[00:27:53.817 --> 00:28:03.024]  The vast majority of those deaths are people with severe debilitating diseases, illnesses, who, tragically enough, would have died anyway.
[00:28:03.845 --> 00:28:08.068]  But they're all counted as COVID deaths, because it's a similar situation in America.
[00:28:08.709 --> 00:28:14.471]  Where the doctors actually get increased promises of funding if they count the death as a COVID death.
[00:28:14.931 --> 00:28:18.612]  So you've got 50,000 excess cancer deaths.
[00:28:18.632 --> 00:28:23.113]  You've already got 10,000 deaths so far just in the past six weeks alone.
[00:28:23.533 --> 00:28:36.356]  Because people who have strokes and heart attacks, when they do call an ambulance, they're waiting an hour, two hours, even three hours sometimes because of the supposed focus on coronavirus, even though hospitals are half empty.
[00:28:36.957 --> 00:28:37.857]  Then you have the TB.
[00:28:38.999 --> 00:28:41.460]  And we wrote about this last week.
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:49.943]  1.4 million people, Alex, this is globally, are going to die according to TB experts from tuberculosis.
[00:28:50.523 --> 00:28:54.044]  1.4 million because they couldn't get hospital treatment.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:29:05.835]  So the current global coronavirus death figure is the official figure anyway, and again, this is people, many of them died with debilitating diseases that were more of a factor than coronavirus, is 280,000.
[00:29:05.895 --> 00:29:07.277]  So even if that were to double
[00:29:10.143 --> 00:29:19.333]  Total global coronavirus deaths, that would still only represent one third of total TB deaths caused by these lockdowns.
[00:29:19.753 --> 00:29:29.503]  We were told to lock down to save lives, yet the very process of doing that is going to cause the loss of significantly more lives.
[00:29:29.783 --> 00:29:31.025]  So what was the point Alex?
[00:29:32.981 --> 00:29:39.988]  Well, Paul, I'm not putting you on the spot because a lot of times you've been right and I've been wrong on, let's say, four or five big subjects.
[00:29:40.008 --> 00:29:40.969]  So I really respect you.
[00:29:41.930 --> 00:29:46.915]  But you remember two and a half months ago, you're like, Alex, come on, the hospitals aren't empty.
[00:29:46.935 --> 00:29:48.357]  You better watch running these stories.
[00:29:48.397 --> 00:29:50.139]  And I said, no, these are real people going out there.
[00:29:50.559 --> 00:29:51.560]  I know it was hard to believe.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:52.881]  Now they admit that's true.
[00:29:53.542 --> 00:29:53.802]  It's
[00:30:12.699 --> 00:30:19.502]  And it's all been concerted to hype it up, to not open the economy, to tell us only two weeks so the hospitals don't get overwhelmed.
[00:30:20.262 --> 00:30:22.483]  Then we're told, oh, actually, two months, two years.
[00:30:23.364 --> 00:30:24.124]  It never ends.
[00:30:25.064 --> 00:30:26.605]  And so the handcuffs were put on us.
[00:30:27.005 --> 00:30:27.825]  We were set up.
[00:30:28.366 --> 00:30:30.807]  I wasn't sure three months ago how deadly it really was.
[00:30:31.867 --> 00:30:34.610]  And so I was saying, hey, we better get ready because it looks really bad.
[00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:39.514]  But it looks like they may use it as a way to lock down and then blame Trump and then try to throw him out of office.
[00:30:39.534 --> 00:30:42.097]  Well, now the Democrats admit that's their whole way of running.
[00:30:42.477 --> 00:30:46.401]  Now, you can say, well, it's don't let a good crisis go to waste, like Hillary said about COVID-19.
[00:30:46.781 --> 00:30:49.103]  Regardless, they're using it to keep things locked down.
[00:30:49.543 --> 00:30:51.105]  They're using it for a total takeover.
[00:30:51.405 --> 00:30:53.107]  What do you think's really behind this whole thing?
[00:30:54.898 --> 00:31:21.241]  I think it's creating the precedent to have these powers become permanent where the government says jump and you say how high, which is why yesterday during Boris Johnson's announcement he's introduced this kind of George W. Bush style colour coded alert level system and they say if it ticks above 2 then we have to re-impose these measures so of course that makes it, that colour coded alert is now going to become permanent
[00:31:21.855 --> 00:31:26.397]  So they can lower it, they can raise it whenever they want people to start obeying.
[00:31:26.457 --> 00:31:27.658]  And think of the perfect plan.
[00:31:27.698 --> 00:31:30.539]  This is martial law, click of a button, flip of a switch.
[00:31:30.939 --> 00:31:34.260]  You just, whenever you want, you just say, oh, there's a deadly virus or there's a problem.
[00:31:34.561 --> 00:31:35.361]  Stay in your homes.
[00:31:35.441 --> 00:31:39.783]  And all of a sudden, out of a Black Mirror episode, here are the robots enforcing it.
[00:31:41.451 --> 00:31:51.577]  Yeah, which of course gives the government de facto permission to criminalise any protest whatsoever by declaring a coronavirus alert in the few days before.
[00:31:51.837 --> 00:31:57.300]  And even if the current government is not going to abuse that power, an infinite number of future governments could.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:03.705]  Meanwhile, you have people, Alex, literally clapping and obeying, worshipping the NHS every Thursday at 8pm.
[00:32:04.105 --> 00:32:08.408]  Then they all go out and cram the parks and violate social distancing.
[00:32:08.488 --> 00:32:09.849]  It's complete hypocrisy.
[00:32:10.269 --> 00:32:14.412]  They're doing it for social media clout, just like the dancing TikTok nurses.
[00:32:14.853 --> 00:32:23.839]  We're going to show all that video when we come back, and your robot enforcers and babies being ripped out of women's arms from Germany to Australia when they dare leave their houses without authorisation.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:25.681]  But all the bureaucrats, they do whatever they want.
[00:32:26.462 --> 00:32:26.902]  Welcome back.
[00:32:26.922 --> 00:32:27.823]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:32:27.863 --> 00:32:30.685]  Paul Joseph Watson of Summit.News is our guest here today.
[00:32:30.705 --> 00:32:43.594]  And I'm sure you've seen the countless videos of police officers beating up innocent citizens that are out on the streets of Germany or New York City in the United States or Sydney, Australia.
[00:32:44.395 --> 00:32:47.497]  Meanwhile, PA sheriffs refused to enforce business shutdown.
[00:32:47.517 --> 00:32:50.679]  They say all businesses are essential.
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.581]  How can only big box stores stay open?
[00:32:53.609 --> 00:32:55.729]  But let's go ahead and roll footage with the audio.
[00:32:56.290 --> 00:33:01.691]  Australian police rip terrified child from mother for protesting lockdown.
[00:33:01.731 --> 00:33:07.172]  I guess Australia, a lot of great people, but it always was a prisoner colony.
[00:33:08.212 --> 00:33:12.974]  Kind of like Hawaii is a beautiful state, but it's still under martial law.
[00:33:13.574 --> 00:33:14.974]  That's why they're totally locked down.
[00:33:15.974 --> 00:33:17.175]  This is totally sick.
[00:33:17.235 --> 00:33:18.595]  Of course, the police aren't wearing masks.
[00:33:18.615 --> 00:33:22.276]  They all know it's a fraud, but they follow their illegal orders.
[00:33:22.516 --> 00:33:23.096]  Here's that video.
[00:33:24.738 --> 00:33:27.600]  The police aren't wearing masks either.
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:28.421]  They're God.
[00:33:28.481 --> 00:33:32.483]  Screaming mother with her child, being on the streets, disappearing.
[00:33:50.449 --> 00:33:52.690]  With the child getting used to these images.
[00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:58.711]  This was all premeditated.
[00:34:02.052 --> 00:34:11.414]  Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, they all said they'd use a global pandemic to bring in the Cashless Society, the surveillance, the forced inoculations, and it's here!
[00:34:11.734 --> 00:34:13.535]  So it is on purpose, it is by design.
[00:34:14.448 --> 00:34:18.769]  And you know, I'm not attacking Jack Posobiec, he's a smart guy, and I like Jack.
[00:34:20.029 --> 00:34:26.891]  But he put out this tweet, he's put out a bunch of these, and so when I make a film about this, which we're making very, very quickly, this is going to be part of the film.
[00:34:27.991 --> 00:34:33.192]  To be clear, COVID-19 is not a deep state Soros-Bill Gates population control conspiracy.
[00:34:33.913 --> 00:34:35.453]  Oh, the CIA termed conspiracy theory.
[00:34:35.953 --> 00:34:37.713]  There is no evidence of this whatsoever.
[00:34:38.854 --> 00:34:43.975]  It is a virus, a terrible global virus, that geez China tried to cover up.
[00:34:45.776 --> 00:34:47.197]  Well, I mean, they admit it came out of Wuhan.
[00:34:47.217 --> 00:34:48.318]  I reported that three months ago.
[00:34:48.338 --> 00:34:53.322]  I broke it all, but we're being told that there just is no proof authoritatively.
[00:34:54.043 --> 00:34:57.246]  Just stated, like the great and powerful laws.
[00:34:57.286 --> 00:35:00.929]  Well, this is going to be what we disprove in the film right here.
[00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:06.434]  And all the other mainstream media dutifully telling us that he's not even connected to Wuhan.
[00:35:06.454 --> 00:35:07.234]  Neither is Fauci.
[00:35:07.274 --> 00:35:08.215]  It's all a conspiracy.
[00:35:08.796 --> 00:35:09.536]  Don't look into that.
[00:35:09.596 --> 00:35:10.477]  Don't look into Fauci.
[00:35:10.497 --> 00:35:11.258]  Don't look into Fauci.
[00:35:12.722 --> 00:35:15.064]  Don't look at the Fauci, we're going to put your ass in prison, Jones.
[00:35:15.985 --> 00:35:16.426]  Go ahead!
[00:35:16.446 --> 00:35:21.291]  Because I'm worried about God, not you.
[00:35:21.891 --> 00:35:25.815]  Paul Joseph Watson, I have the article here, U.S.
[00:35:26.196 --> 00:35:30.961]  risking a second wave and a depression, Mark Zandi says, of Moody's!
[00:35:31.621 --> 00:35:33.643]  And he says if we don't stay locked down,
[00:35:34.872 --> 00:35:37.934]  There'll be mass death, and then the economy will have a depression.
[00:35:38.114 --> 00:35:46.060]  But these very same people continue that are telling us, stay locked down or we're all dead, are the ones that we keep learning or betting against the stock market, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.501]  It's simple math.
[00:35:47.601 --> 00:35:50.223]  You stay locked down, we have a global depression.
[00:35:50.263 --> 00:35:51.944]  You open up, we don't have a depression.
[00:35:52.164 --> 00:35:53.045]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:35:54.526 --> 00:36:02.792]  Yeah, this whole second wave fear-mongering is based on the R-rate, which is the rate of reinfection, the rate of infection for coronavirus.
[00:36:03.564 --> 00:36:10.568]  No government knows the R8 because nobody knows how many people in any given country are infected with coronavirus.
[00:36:10.868 --> 00:36:19.634]  So the UK's entire model, which is when they say, oh, when the R8 gets above one, then we can reimpose lockdown.
[00:36:19.954 --> 00:36:21.935]  They don't know what the R8 is.
[00:36:22.355 --> 00:36:23.436]  It's speculative.
[00:36:23.476 --> 00:36:27.979]  It's complete speculation because they don't know how many people are infected with the virus.
[00:36:28.419 --> 00:36:35.585]  So their entire strategy of, oh, if there's a second wave, if the R number goes back above one, we have to reimpose these measures.
[00:36:36.005 --> 00:36:37.906]  Nobody knows what that figure is.
[00:36:38.307 --> 00:36:39.588]  So again, it's complete BS.
[00:36:39.628 --> 00:36:46.373]  And then you look at Sweden, Alex, you look at Japan, you look at Belarus, countries which did not impose lockdowns.
[00:36:46.793 --> 00:36:47.294]  Sweden,
[00:36:48.166 --> 00:36:59.212]  Now has largely herd immunity without having to destroy their economy, without tens of thousands of potential cancer victims not getting treatment, without stroke heart attack victims not getting treatment.
[00:37:00.013 --> 00:37:01.634]  They did not impose a lockdown.
[00:37:01.854 --> 00:37:05.256]  They have a lower death rate per capita than the UK.
[00:37:05.476 --> 00:37:09.098]  They have a lower RA infection rate compared to the UK.
[00:37:09.518 --> 00:37:10.559]  You can look at Japan.
[00:37:11.215 --> 00:37:16.562]  Population 126 million compared to the UK's population which is 66 million.
[00:37:17.022 --> 00:37:19.165]  We've had 32,000 COVID deaths.
[00:37:19.605 --> 00:37:20.887]  They've had 624.
[00:37:20.967 --> 00:37:25.092]  They had international air traffic coming in just as we did.
[00:37:25.653 --> 00:37:26.754]  They didn't lock down.
[00:37:27.735 --> 00:37:28.116]  So again,
[00:37:28.855 --> 00:37:40.204]  New studies now coming out, Alex, show that this social distancing, that you have to be in extremely close proximity with somebody for an extended period of time to have the virus be transmitted.
[00:37:40.724 --> 00:37:49.371]  Studies showing that social distancing had no impact on the rates of deaths, the rates of infections, yet they haven't updated the science.
[00:37:49.711 --> 00:37:58.398]  Our entire model in the UK was based on this prediction by Professor Neil Ferguson, Imperial College, that half a million people would die.
[00:37:59.013 --> 00:38:07.917]  This same guy's predictions for foot and mouth disease, for SARS, for all these other epidemics, were used by UK governments going back 10-15 years.
[00:38:08.217 --> 00:38:10.338]  They were all spectacularly wrong.
[00:38:10.778 --> 00:38:17.701]  Yet this is the guy, the authority that has been used for the model, not only for the UK, but for countries like South Africa.
[00:38:18.221 --> 00:38:19.482]  We had the article last week.
[00:38:20.002 --> 00:38:34.307]  Experts now say the lockdown will cause 29 times more deaths than coronavirus in South Africa, based on this debunked, ridiculous model from a guy who's been spectacularly wrong time and time again.
[00:38:34.687 --> 00:38:43.250]  The same guy, by the way, who violated his own lockdown to have his married mistress, mother of two, come visit him for some hanky-panky.
[00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:47.954]  So he took it that seriously that he broke it himself at the first opportunity.
[00:38:48.394 --> 00:38:49.495]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:38:52.117 --> 00:38:55.740]  Paul, again, I've got all the graphs here.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:01.385]  California had one twentieth or less the number of deaths they projected.
[00:39:02.466 --> 00:39:05.908]  But they have headlines out, California worse than expected.
[00:39:06.409 --> 00:39:07.990]  California level spike.
[00:39:09.571 --> 00:39:11.033]  And it's just totally made up.
[00:39:12.008 --> 00:39:15.611]  The graph was way up here, now it's way down here because there's a tiny little bump.
[00:39:15.891 --> 00:39:16.832]  They go, oh look!
[00:39:18.294 --> 00:39:19.395]  It'd be like if you had a weatherman.
[00:39:20.484 --> 00:39:30.308]  Out in the Mojave Desert, and there's no clouds in the sky, and he's on the news saying, tomorrow we're going to have 20 inches of rain and giant thunderstorms for a month.
[00:39:30.908 --> 00:39:40.452]  And you have a month of no precipitation, totally blue skies, and still the weatherman's on, but the weatherman tells you don't leave your house because of the floods.
[00:39:40.852 --> 00:39:43.393]  So everybody's staying in their houses, you look outside, it's sunny.
[00:39:44.192 --> 00:39:48.974]  But nobody goes out because the weatherman says there's tornadoes and floods and Noah's Ark.
[00:39:49.034 --> 00:39:51.034]  That's the level of this hoax.
[00:39:51.154 --> 00:39:54.876]  And now the weatherman says, to leave your house, you gotta have a microchip in your body.
[00:39:56.196 --> 00:39:57.296]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[00:39:57.797 --> 00:40:02.818]  Benjamin Netanyahu is saying, you know, put microchips in kids.
[00:40:02.838 --> 00:40:04.099]  And we're showing Sweden right now.
[00:40:04.399 --> 00:40:05.459]  You can show California.
[00:40:05.679 --> 00:40:06.600]  You can show the UK.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.640]  You can show Canada.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:08.680]  You can show the US.
[00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:09.561]  It's all the same.
[00:40:09.601 --> 00:40:10.521]  The graph looks the same.
[00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:12.101]  They're way up here prediction.
[00:40:12.321 --> 00:40:13.422]  We're way down here.
[00:40:14.548 --> 00:40:21.296]  Then they call hills and valleys of supposed COVID, they call that the ups.
[00:40:21.696 --> 00:40:27.923]  They report on the ups of that when all it is is them reporting normal people that died of pre-existing conditions.
[00:40:27.964 --> 00:40:31.167]  Paul, this is the biggest hoax on the planet's ever seen.
[00:40:31.688 --> 00:40:34.011]  My God, where do you think this is going and how do we stop this?
[00:40:35.546 --> 00:40:40.988]  I mean, it's going to having mandatory government apps on your phone that listen to your conversations.
[00:40:41.068 --> 00:40:45.811]  We know they've already got the technology for that and the microchip, which is what they've proposed.
[00:40:46.471 --> 00:40:49.472]  The fact is, somebody did a study.
[00:40:49.832 --> 00:40:55.975]  Eight people under the age of 19 die in the UK every year from putting their trousers on.
[00:40:56.525 --> 00:41:01.473]  That's the same number of people under the age of 19 who have died from Covid in the UK.
[00:41:01.893 --> 00:41:06.040]  You had the director of the Department of Public Health, Dr Iziki,
[00:41:06.741 --> 00:41:07.662]  But Paul, they're not
[00:41:34.656 --> 00:41:43.123]  We're not doing it because it's the same big pharma that funds the NIH and funds the National Health Service and funds the UN that has the giant power grab.
[00:41:43.163 --> 00:41:44.263]  Do five more minutes with us.
[00:41:44.524 --> 00:41:45.404]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:41:45.444 --> 00:41:48.407]  I want to cover another subject with you as we start the next hour.
[00:41:48.447 --> 00:41:50.348]  Then I'm going to open the phones up and cover a ton of news.
[00:41:50.628 --> 00:41:51.609]  And then David Ickes joining us.
[00:41:51.649 --> 00:41:52.310]  Please don't forget.
[00:41:53.627 --> 00:42:02.393]  Infowars.com and Newswars.com are some of the only independent pro-freedom, pro-human sites that actually have audio and video and reports and crew and guests.
[00:42:02.973 --> 00:42:05.395]  All the major platforms are shutting everybody down.
[00:42:06.530 --> 00:42:08.091]  They're shutting medical doctors down.
[00:42:08.111 --> 00:42:09.952]  They're shutting down prestigious scientists.
[00:42:10.193 --> 00:42:14.436]  They're shutting down Cedars-Sinai when they come out and say Trump is right about light therapy.
[00:42:14.996 --> 00:42:17.418]  This is total control to push this agenda.
[00:42:17.498 --> 00:42:18.578]  It's by design.
[00:42:18.919 --> 00:42:19.739]  It's draconian.
[00:42:19.819 --> 00:42:20.700]  It's all admitted.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:21.861]  No more denial.
[00:42:21.981 --> 00:42:26.344]  And don't forget, Paul has his excellent site, summit.news.
[00:42:26.944 --> 00:42:31.728]  And don't forget, we have the big mega sale, the biggest of the year yet, that has to end this weekend.
[00:42:33.364 --> 00:42:39.169]  30 to 60% off on the high-quality supplements at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:42:39.229 --> 00:42:40.390]  Krill Oil's back in stock.
[00:42:41.031 --> 00:42:42.172]  X2 is back in stock.
[00:42:42.292 --> 00:42:44.874]  And these are great products that fund our operation.
[00:42:45.274 --> 00:42:46.555]  VazoVeet's back in stock.
[00:42:46.595 --> 00:42:50.418]  Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus are selling out, but they're still 50% off.
[00:42:50.718 --> 00:42:51.659]  Take advantage of that now.
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:55.883]  So now, mainline reporters.
[00:42:57.162 --> 00:43:07.551]  That just do stories covering the different ideas and theories about where COVID-19 came from, as the evidence mounts, it was made in the lab and released on purpose, are being blocked by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.
[00:43:08.352 --> 00:43:13.917]  Now, Twitter announced last week that they're gonna be blocking tweets in live time with AI before you can even send them out.
[00:43:13.997 --> 00:43:23.185]  And a bunch of people I've talked to, like Millie Weaver, Kaitlin Bennett, and others, are trying to just put out reports, and if they say hydroxychloroquine,
[00:43:24.068 --> 00:43:27.990]  Anywhere in there, just covering what Trump says, they're not allowed to upload it.
[00:43:28.651 --> 00:43:31.012]  So this is the total censorship.
[00:43:31.052 --> 00:43:49.663]  But in the UK, Paul Watson's written for summit.news, they are now sending people to your house, including Nigel Farage, the shadow prime minister, the man behind Boris Johnson, because he dared as a journalist, go show where the Muslims are still invading at the coastline.
[00:43:51.010 --> 00:43:52.591]  This is total tyranny.
[00:43:52.651 --> 00:43:53.912]  This is the power grab.
[00:43:54.353 --> 00:43:57.595]  This is the great leap forward of the post-human era.
[00:43:57.855 --> 00:44:00.818]  Paul Watson, tell us about the latest developments in the UK that we know is a beta test.
[00:44:02.455 --> 00:44:12.742]  Well of course over the past few weeks we've had numerous stories about police using surveillance drones to harass and publicly shame people for walking their dogs in remote areas of the countryside.
[00:44:12.762 --> 00:44:14.022]  They were very proud about that.
[00:44:14.423 --> 00:44:29.492]  We had numerous reports of people having their shopping bags inspected and in one case, in fact several cases, if you'd purchased wine or snacks, crisps, chips, stuff like that, they said they claimed that was an inessential purchase.
[00:44:29.972 --> 00:44:30.613]  Completely
[00:44:31.594 --> 00:44:37.497]  In a complete misunderstanding of the law, any shop that's open is selling essential goods.
[00:44:37.557 --> 00:44:41.498]  And that's because the police are rabid communist globalist enforcers.
[00:44:42.759 --> 00:44:45.720]  Yeah, and now I put up this article on Saturday.
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:51.543]  They're investigating people who make tweets dissenting against social distancing and lockdown.
[00:44:51.963 --> 00:44:53.904]  Somebody who was quite vehement in doing so.
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:45:05.548]  Notice that after he had tweeted critical messages against the police, the law, he went onto his LinkedIn profile and it said he had nine visits from the Metropolitan Police.
[00:45:06.049 --> 00:45:22.621]  So we've literally got a hundred thousand people from foreign countries still landing at UK airports with no health checks, no quarantine, they only just changed that law now, coming straight into the country, dispersing amongst the transport system, no checks whatsoever,
[00:45:23.382 --> 00:45:36.450]  We've got record numbers of boat migrants coming in from France, from Calais, into Dover, into the South Coast, with the government again acting as a taxi service to rescue them and bring them into the country.
[00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:38.511]  Meanwhile, we're under house arrest.
[00:45:38.951 --> 00:45:44.535]  Meanwhile, Nigel Farage goes and reports on it, takes a cameraman, does a two-minute piece to camera.
[00:45:45.242 --> 00:45:49.986]  The day after he gets a visit from the police, even though he's part of the media.
[00:45:50.326 --> 00:45:52.188]  He's got a national newspaper column.
[00:45:52.508 --> 00:45:55.691]  He's a national syndicator radio host with LBC.
[00:45:56.251 --> 00:46:00.595]  That is, under the government's own law, an essential key worker.
[00:46:00.915 --> 00:46:05.319]  He's in the media, yet he still gets a visit from the police warning him not to do that.
[00:46:05.359 --> 00:46:06.941]  He said he's going to ignore that warning.
[00:46:07.281 --> 00:46:09.503]  And again, that's because of people tackling on him.
[00:46:09.823 --> 00:46:10.724]  You also have Alex
[00:46:11.567 --> 00:46:15.513]  This kind of new high priest class of the people who are wearing the masks.
[00:46:15.993 --> 00:46:21.060]  It's become this kind of status symbol of them being better than you because they're obeying the law better than you.
[00:46:21.381 --> 00:46:24.625]  They get to preach that you're not obeying social distancing.
[00:46:25.046 --> 00:46:25.687]  Funny thing is,
[00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:28.171]  Oh, it's all virtue signaling.
[00:46:48.846 --> 00:46:50.108]  It's all virtue signaling crap.
[00:46:50.528 --> 00:46:59.999]  Isn't the key, though, the UN's own admission that 100 million are set to starve, 30 million right now, and pointing out to their face you're causing mass collapse worldwide while you sit here on welfare?
[00:47:00.299 --> 00:47:01.381]  We've got to get back to work, Paul.
[00:47:03.413 --> 00:47:07.054]  Yeah, but the irony is that the lockdown is causing mass death.
[00:47:07.114 --> 00:47:13.455]  It's going to cause 1.4 million TB deaths across the whole world because people can't get treatment.
[00:47:13.755 --> 00:47:17.576]  The lockdown is the mass killer, way more than coronavirus.
[00:47:17.596 --> 00:47:17.876]  That's right.
[00:47:17.896 --> 00:47:23.998]  All the experts who are not getting much media play, but they're saying this, are desperately trying to warn people of that fact.
[00:47:24.038 --> 00:47:24.458]  Well, that's right.
[00:47:24.478 --> 00:47:26.959]  The media goes, COVID-19 causing global starvation.
[00:47:26.979 --> 00:47:28.059]  No, the lockdown is.
[00:47:28.379 --> 00:47:29.239]  Summit.News.
[00:47:29.519 --> 00:47:31.540]  Paul Joseph Watson, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:47:32.560 --> 00:47:32.960]  Thanks, Alex.
[00:47:33.626 --> 00:47:34.166]  Stay with us.
[00:47:34.647 --> 00:47:39.530]  Your phone calls, a ton of news, and then David Icke on the most censored broadcast in the world.
[00:47:39.850 --> 00:47:41.611]  Whatever you do, don't spread the word.
[00:47:42.011 --> 00:47:43.192]  Lay down and die.
[00:47:44.493 --> 00:47:50.737]  Well, you know Bill and Melinda Gates' patent to track you by microchip or arm bracelet to buy and sell under COVID-19.
[00:47:50.917 --> 00:47:55.780]  They have another patent to put an implantable chip in your skin that's ink inside the vaccine.
[00:47:57.278 --> 00:48:11.552]  Well, now a bill has been introduced for $100 million by the Democrats to have contract tracers that track and trace and enforce the next wave of the lockdowns that are coming and the big bio-attack that is phase two that Bill Gates says is coming.
[00:48:11.792 --> 00:48:13.654]  And believe me, he should know.
[00:48:13.754 --> 00:48:20.100]  This is just a drill to make sure you shelter in place and die inside your home when they launch the real bio-attack.
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.442]  All the evidence shows.
[00:48:22.022 --> 00:48:24.046]  But this powerful report is on Bandot Video.
[00:48:24.066 --> 00:48:27.291]  There's a new bill that has 666 in the title.
[00:48:27.331 --> 00:48:28.633]  They seem to always do this.
[00:48:29.194 --> 00:48:33.020]  That's HR 6666, the bill of the beast.
[00:48:33.060 --> 00:48:33.461]  Here it is.
[00:48:34.454 --> 00:48:41.920]  The World Health Organization recommended forcibly removing family members from their homes and putting them in quarantine.
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:52.427]  Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[00:48:52.707 --> 00:48:56.330]  Queen Elizabeth seemed to be echoing this idea to the UK.
[00:48:56.550 --> 00:49:02.635]  It reminds me of the very first broadcast I made in 1940, helped by my sister.
[00:49:04.178 --> 00:49:12.647]  We as children spoke from here at Windsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety.
[00:49:14.189 --> 00:49:20.315]  Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones.
[00:49:22.025 --> 00:49:26.966]  But now as in, we know deep down that it is the right thing to do.
[00:49:26.986 --> 00:49:31.967]  Bill Gates has been pushing the idea of tracking people with digital tattoos.
[00:49:32.767 --> 00:49:42.749]  And Microsoft was recently granted patent number 060606 for a cryptocurrency surveillance system connected to the human body.
[00:49:44.649 --> 00:49:46.230]  Now enter HR6666.
[00:49:49.352 --> 00:50:10.871]  To authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19 and related activities such as contact tracing through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals' residences and for other purposes.
[00:50:12.173 --> 00:50:18.500]  On May 1st of 2020, Illinois Congressman Bobby Rush introduced H.R.
[00:50:19.381 --> 00:50:18.500]  6666.
[00:50:20.342 --> 00:50:27.230]  This act is essentially setting up a nationwide contact tracing and quarantine program run by Big Pharma.
[00:50:28.331 --> 00:50:52.025]  Section 2, COVID-19 testing and contact tracing using mobile health units, will allow Bill Gates loyalist Alex Azar and the CDC to fund eligible entities to conduct tests, trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals and to support the quarantine of these contacts via mobile health units.
[00:50:53.103 --> 00:50:56.706]  Who are the eligible entities qualified to receive this funding?
[00:50:57.466 --> 00:51:04.652]  Health centers, non-profit organizations, high schools, and anyone else that Alex Azar deems eligible.
[00:51:05.592 --> 00:51:13.678]  The amount of taxpayer dollars being asked for to trace the public and force quarantines is $100 billion for 2020 alone.
[00:51:14.419 --> 00:51:18.742]  And whatever may be necessary as long as the emergency period continues.
[00:51:20.083 --> 00:51:22.345]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:51:25.715 --> 00:51:36.620]  By the way, if you want to see his amazing reports, you simply go to Bandot Video, click on the left-hand corner, go to the Gregory's section, and you can see all of those reports there.
[00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:42.083]  The average report has about 170,000 views, which is a real shame.
[00:51:42.523 --> 00:51:45.505]  They need to be seen by millions and millions and millions of people.
[00:51:46.685 --> 00:51:47.746]  They're absolutely critical.
[00:51:47.766 --> 00:51:51.968]  He's got a big one he's getting ready that we're going to air in the second segment
[00:51:53.198 --> 00:51:55.079]  of the fourth hour today.
[00:51:55.379 --> 00:51:59.901]  And then, Gerald Solente will take over until the war room with Owen Schroer.
[00:52:01.262 --> 00:52:03.243]  This is causing a worldwide meltdown.
[00:52:03.263 --> 00:52:06.004]  Now Hollywood and the globalists admit, oh, it's for the earth.
[00:52:06.204 --> 00:52:07.505]  It's good to have the lockdown.
[00:52:07.845 --> 00:52:09.466]  You're never going to have your job again.
[00:52:09.786 --> 00:52:14.188]  First, they told you that industry and farming was bad, that you would be a service person.
[00:52:14.728 --> 00:52:15.709]  That would be the new economy.
[00:52:15.749 --> 00:52:17.810]  Now they got you to be obsolete.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:22.964]  They're replacing you with robots and saying, don't worry, you'll get a universal income.
[00:52:24.285 --> 00:52:26.807]  That's a pittance, but you got to take the vaccines.
[00:52:26.827 --> 00:52:27.588]  You got to do what we say.
[00:52:28.088 --> 00:52:34.493]  Now the new DNA vaccines go into your cells and reprogram them at the cellular level.
[00:52:35.775 --> 00:52:37.016]  That's called cancer.
[00:52:38.397 --> 00:52:39.698]  And it's so incredibly dangerous.
[00:52:42.642 --> 00:52:48.467]  Meanwhile, 1.4 million people to die from untreated TB due to coronavirus lockdown.
[00:52:48.487 --> 00:53:01.317]  Scientists in Brazil have found that countries most affected by the coronavirus spread are the ones continuing to allow unrestricted travel across their borders, prompting further arguments that the most effective method of preventing the spread is tighter frontier controls.
[00:53:01.337 --> 00:53:03.739]  The research carried out by the Federal University of
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:10.323]  Salvador suggests that screening and quarantining those coming into countries from the outside could be the best way.
[00:53:10.343 --> 00:53:20.709]  The bit goes in to break down the fact that TB now is exploding and because of people not getting treatment from it, they estimate 1.4 million additional will die.
[00:53:20.729 --> 00:53:23.550]  In fact, even the London Guardian has reported that as well.
[00:53:25.091 --> 00:53:26.752]  So, let's go ahead and look at the facts.
[00:53:27.232 --> 00:53:31.154]  Why are 15,000 people a day flying into the UK unrestricted, untested?
[00:53:31.174 --> 00:53:32.335]  Because it's all a hoax!
[00:53:33.407 --> 00:53:40.611]  They count all normal deaths from cancer or heart attacks or other diseases in the column.
[00:53:41.952 --> 00:53:43.053]  That's all admitted.
[00:53:43.073 --> 00:53:49.036]  And I keep harping on that because this is designed to bring down our economy.
[00:53:51.038 --> 00:53:55.360]  Now, what I wanna do is open the phones up and I wanna discuss this with everybody.
[00:53:56.321 --> 00:53:59.243]  In the next segment, I'm gonna get into this really important piece.
[00:54:00.111 --> 00:54:04.955]  Because we've seen these Moody's and Barron's and all the people that rape the stock market.
[00:54:04.975 --> 00:54:12.882]  Talk about insiders come out and say, oh, if we open things, it'll cause a depression because we'll never get rid of COVID.
[00:54:13.443 --> 00:54:18.527]  They chose the common cold that they patented and own so that it never goes away.
[00:54:18.567 --> 00:54:19.749]  So everyone's suspect.
[00:54:20.729 --> 00:54:22.651]  And so they can attribute it to every death.
[00:54:22.811 --> 00:54:24.493]  That's how the scam works.
[00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.629]  U.S.
[00:54:27.070 --> 00:54:30.892]  risking a second wave and a depression, Mark Zandi warns.
[00:54:31.193 --> 00:54:32.794]  We're going to cover this and then go to your calls.
[00:54:33.254 --> 00:54:34.155]  Start of the next segment.
[00:54:35.696 --> 00:54:41.480]  I want to give first time callers a chance to call in, particularly medical workers, law enforcement, military.
[00:54:43.424 --> 00:54:45.025]  You'll go to the head of the line because I want to hear from you.
[00:54:45.045 --> 00:54:45.925]  We're going to go to everybody.
[00:54:45.985 --> 00:54:49.687]  First-time callers, please give us your take on the situation.
[00:54:49.707 --> 00:54:49.867]  877-789-2539.
[00:54:49.887 --> 00:54:50.087]  877-789-Alex.
[00:54:50.107 --> 00:54:50.147]  877-789-2539.
[00:54:50.167 --> 00:54:51.908]  Some folks don't have 1-800 calling from outside the U.S.
[00:54:51.928 --> 00:54:53.469]  So you dial your country code and then 512-646-1776.
[00:54:53.489 --> 00:54:53.549]  512-646-1776.
[00:54:53.569 --> 00:54:55.389]  And we'll go to your phone calls.
[00:55:11.374 --> 00:55:12.415]  And I'm not going to be rude.
[00:55:12.655 --> 00:55:13.756]  What's rude is making you hold.
[00:55:13.776 --> 00:55:17.218]  I'm going to try to go to you quickly and move the next person without the pleasantries.
[00:55:17.778 --> 00:55:20.180]  So in the interest of that, I'm not going to thank you for calling.
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:21.721]  I'm just going to go to you.
[00:55:21.741 --> 00:55:26.644]  We're going to test that out today because by the time I thank you and you thank me, we've blown 20 seconds of what you could be saying.
[00:55:26.664 --> 00:55:28.125]  So I'm just going to say, boom, you're on.
[00:55:28.325 --> 00:55:28.946]  Boom, you're gone.
[00:55:29.006 --> 00:55:29.566]  Boom, you're on.
[00:55:29.786 --> 00:55:30.367]  Boom, you're gone.
[00:55:30.687 --> 00:55:32.048]  Like I used to do 25 years ago.
[00:55:32.408 --> 00:55:33.268]  We'll see if we can do that.
[00:55:33.288 --> 00:55:33.328]  877-789-2539.
[00:55:34.169 --> 00:55:35.090]  Okay.
[00:55:40.549 --> 00:55:47.294]  I'm also going to be interviewing David Icke coming up in the next hour.
[00:55:47.314 --> 00:56:00.624]  And then, of course, we've got the situation coming out with General Flynn and some of the articles dealing with that on Infowars.com.
[00:56:01.264 --> 00:56:07.549]  How now even the DOJ is slamming NBC's Chuck Todd over deceptive editing of AG Barr interview.
[00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:09.671]  Yeah, how's that feel, Barr?
[00:56:11.189 --> 00:56:17.032]  When the media lies about what you say, and then comes after you.
[00:56:20.314 --> 00:56:27.798]  I've had the Attorney General in New York, who we're considering legal action against right now, say that I claim I have a cure to COVID-19 or a treatment.
[00:56:27.878 --> 00:56:29.759]  I never said any such thing.
[00:56:30.639 --> 00:56:33.401]  And then she used the claims that I was committing crimes
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:34.720]  We're good to go.
[00:57:04.963 --> 00:57:05.724]  I'm so sick of it.
[00:57:05.784 --> 00:57:12.108]  CBS just got caught staging people going into hospitals and fake lines of cars as we first reported.
[00:57:12.748 --> 00:57:15.850]  There's no depth to which these criminals will not sink.
[00:57:16.651 --> 00:57:19.593]  And now they're telling us we're locked down under martial law forever.
[00:57:21.434 --> 00:57:22.535]  What are we doing today?
[00:57:25.196 --> 00:57:26.878]  Doing the same thing we do every day, Pinky.
[00:57:27.078 --> 00:57:28.058]  Taking over the world.
[00:57:29.179 --> 00:57:30.200]  That's Pinky and the Brain.
[00:57:31.738 --> 00:57:34.499]  There are always people that want to dominate and take control of everything.
[00:57:34.559 --> 00:57:35.179]  It's their nature.
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:39.201]  And globalism is a corporate takeover of the nation-state.
[00:57:40.762 --> 00:57:43.623]  Globalism is total domination.
[00:57:45.484 --> 00:57:46.624]  For domination's sake.
[00:57:48.245 --> 00:57:58.589]  Anti-God, anti-family, because people that have God and have family are self-sufficient and strong and they're not easily malleable like clay to the potter.
[00:58:01.209 --> 00:58:17.717]  And so we watched, going back three months ago, four months ago, all these financial experts, all these billionaires, going on CNBC, going on MSNBC, going on CNN, saying, if Trump doesn't lock the economy down, we're going to have a total depression.
[00:58:18.558 --> 00:58:20.558]  We're like, really, if you lock it down, it'll cause depression.
[00:58:22.119 --> 00:58:23.400]  Then it turned out those individuals,
[00:58:25.748 --> 00:58:31.151]  Had done giant put options against the stock market, and when it plunged, they made billions of dollars.
[00:58:31.272 --> 00:58:33.033]  One guy made $2 billion in one day.
[00:58:34.694 --> 00:58:38.476]  Oh, but Martha Stewart went to jail for selling a million dollars or whatever of her stock, 800,000.
[00:58:38.636 --> 00:58:41.778]  Oh, but when they do it, it's okay, it's good.
[00:58:42.258 --> 00:58:45.581]  Well, Moody's, that tells you what everything's valued.
[00:58:46.761 --> 00:58:51.764]  Mark Zandi has come out and said, oh, the states are opening too soon.
[00:58:52.819 --> 00:58:58.343]  And if that happens, why, it's gonna cause another wave, which they're always planning to say is another wave.
[00:58:59.063 --> 00:59:01.425]  Again, all their numbers were 40, 50 times off.
[00:59:02.546 --> 00:59:06.788]  They adjusted them, and now they zoom way down to the little tiny number and make it huge.
[00:59:06.828 --> 00:59:07.109]  Why?
[00:59:07.569 --> 00:59:08.890]  Why, we've got an emergency!
[00:59:09.210 --> 00:59:11.151]  Five new cases in Wuhan!
[00:59:11.211 --> 00:59:12.572]  Everybody run for the hills!
[00:59:15.074 --> 00:59:16.955]  Why, Germany's got 50 new cases!
[00:59:16.975 --> 00:59:18.036]  We're all dead!
[00:59:19.297 --> 00:59:20.738]  For seven and a half billion people.
[00:59:22.267 --> 00:59:23.808]  Up to 60 million die a year.
[00:59:26.009 --> 00:59:31.171]  Millions are dying from TB, they can't get treatment, and heart attacks, and cancer, and suicide, but that's okay!
[00:59:32.172 --> 00:59:33.832]  Let's put up the world map here, can we?
[00:59:33.892 --> 00:59:35.713]  Of the supposed dead worldwide.
[00:59:36.754 --> 00:59:37.754]  Not even near a million.
[00:59:38.755 --> 00:59:40.996]  And that's with them appropriating every death.
[00:59:41.036 --> 00:59:49.720]  But I predict, by the end of this year, they'll say 20 million worldwide, because they incentivize money by global standardization to the WHO.
[00:59:52.961 --> 00:59:55.842]  Or everyone's going to say it's a COVID death to get that money.
[00:59:55.862 --> 00:59:57.383]  Because we have a global government.
[00:59:58.044 --> 00:59:59.664]  We have private corporate groups dictating.
[00:59:59.844 --> 01:00:02.105]  So let's put it back on screen.
[01:00:02.126 --> 01:00:04.247]  283,000 deaths globally.
[01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:07.708]  79,000 in the US.
[01:00:07.728 --> 01:00:09.209]  32,000 in the UK.
[01:00:09.229 --> 01:00:10.850]  30,000 in Italy.
[01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:13.991]  46,000 in Spain, France, Brazil.
[01:00:14.912 --> 01:00:18.854]  Brazil was going to be a million dead because Palosaro didn't lock it down.
[01:00:18.914 --> 01:00:19.254]  Now it's 11,207.
[01:00:23.729 --> 01:00:24.611]  Let's look at Sweden.
[01:00:25.512 --> 01:00:26.394]  They didn't do anything.
[01:00:26.734 --> 01:00:27.877]  They've got one of the lowest deaths.
[01:00:27.897 --> 01:00:30.121]  That's because they're not doing fraudulent testing.
[01:00:33.126 --> 01:00:35.010]  It's all a giant scam.
[01:00:38.131 --> 01:00:48.841]  And they're gonna have the blue cities and the blue states first, and the big corporations not let you leave your house, not let you have a job, unless you've got that ID card or that digital app on your phone saying you're kosher.
[01:00:49.521 --> 01:01:02.754]  And morons that opt into this, like they're the good people, they're the heroes, they need to be confronted with the fact that they're schmucks, engineering a global financial collapse and mass death in the third world of tens of millions!
[01:01:04.226 --> 01:01:05.727]  Who can't get basic medicine!
[01:01:06.468 --> 01:01:07.689]  And who are starving to death!
[01:01:07.929 --> 01:01:09.230]  That's the real world!
[01:01:09.410 --> 01:01:11.272]  You delicate geniuses!
[01:01:12.092 --> 01:01:13.934]  You beautiful leftist losers!
[01:01:14.294 --> 01:01:15.815]  You dumbass followers!
[01:01:18.257 --> 01:01:20.519]  Oh, but here's Mark Zandy!
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:25.301]  Mark Zandi, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:01:26.201 --> 01:01:27.922]  Yeah, blow that up on screen for me over here, please.
[01:01:28.582 --> 01:01:29.602]  My eyes aren't what they used to be.
[01:01:29.642 --> 01:01:30.443]  I can't see it over there.
[01:01:31.143 --> 01:01:33.203]  How many people we got dead in Sweden?
[01:01:33.243 --> 01:01:34.624]  Let's see the numbers in Sweden for me.
[01:01:35.824 --> 01:01:39.826]  Pretty please, cupcakes on top.
[01:01:39.846 --> 01:01:43.587]  3,256 in Sweden.
[01:01:45.428 --> 01:01:47.388]  What's the flu usually killing Sweden every year?
[01:01:47.428 --> 01:01:48.169]  I was looking it up, about 15,000.
[01:01:51.220 --> 01:01:52.761]  Of course, there's no deaths now in the U.S.
[01:01:52.781 --> 01:01:57.904]  from flu, because they're all attributed to COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID.
[01:01:57.924 --> 01:02:03.567]  They ought to have that as the new European siren on police cars, instead of, nyeh-oh, nyeh-oh, nyeh-oh.
[01:02:04.067 --> 01:02:06.609]  It's COVID, COVID, COVID.
[01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:07.149]  Oh, what?
[01:02:07.189 --> 01:02:08.049]  It is civilization.
[01:02:08.310 --> 01:02:17.735]  Oh, a panic over a virus run by Bill and Melinda Gates' psychotics that said they want a global reset and to shut the economy down, and now Hollywood's celebrating it, saying we all deserve to starve to death.
[01:02:19.104 --> 01:02:19.824]  But it's okay.
[01:02:20.105 --> 01:02:26.168]  Here's Mark Zandi on CNBC telling you he doesn't want a depression.
[01:02:26.969 --> 01:02:28.509]  So just keep the economy shut down.
[01:02:28.549 --> 01:02:34.413]  It's like saying, I don't want you to die, so let me shoot you in the head with a 12 gauge shotgun at point-blank range.
[01:02:34.433 --> 01:02:35.694]  You're like, that'll kill me.
[01:02:35.874 --> 01:02:36.354]  No, it won't.
[01:02:38.155 --> 01:02:39.336]  He's like, I love your thumb.
[01:02:39.356 --> 01:02:40.837]  Let me smash it with a hammer.
[01:02:43.258 --> 01:02:44.819]  Oh, but he's a hero.
[01:02:45.993 --> 01:02:47.673]  Here's the you, Mr. Hero.
[01:02:47.913 --> 01:02:49.214]  Here's the you, Mark Zandi.
[01:02:49.254 --> 01:02:49.794]  Here he is.
[01:02:51.014 --> 01:02:54.135]  The prospect of a depression, given the data we have today, Mark.
[01:02:54.175 --> 01:02:54.775]  Your thoughts there?
[01:02:56.255 --> 01:03:11.238]  Well, I think if we reopen too quickly and we see infections rise, get a second wave, and that causes more business disruption, we may not shut down again, but certainly it will scare people, spook people, and weigh on the economy.
[01:03:11.278 --> 01:03:13.319]  That would be the fodder for a depression.
[01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:17.726]  Nomenclature depression would be double-digit unemployment for more than a year.
[01:03:17.746 --> 01:03:18.586]  We already have that.
[01:03:18.706 --> 01:03:24.769]  You know, if we get through this period without another wave, then this will end up being a really bad recession.
[01:03:24.809 --> 01:03:27.531]  But if we get a second wave, it'll be depression.
[01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:32.253]  And of course they're gonna call it a second wave and a third and a fourth and a fifth.
[01:03:32.273 --> 01:03:35.655]  Bill Gates said last week, I played the clip last hour, he said,
[01:03:37.469 --> 01:03:46.253]  Talking to Stephen Colbert, the comic that poses a newsman that now poses as our doctor, he said, oh, this is just wave one.
[01:03:46.293 --> 01:03:47.774]  The next wave's a bio-attack.
[01:03:48.354 --> 01:03:50.495]  As I've told you for years, a real bio-attack.
[01:03:51.135 --> 01:03:57.578]  This is just making sure you behave yourself, because they don't want things to get out of hand when they really take an axe to your ass.
[01:03:58.779 --> 01:04:00.239]  And so that's what I've been telling listeners.
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:02.520]  I'm actually now moving to the country.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:05.762]  I'm actually building the Armored Fortress.
[01:04:06.977 --> 01:04:09.038]  Looked like a farmhouse, but it's gonna have steel walls.
[01:04:10.058 --> 01:04:12.198]  I'm actually giving up on folks.
[01:04:12.258 --> 01:04:14.559]  I mean, spiritually, we gotta get people right with God.
[01:04:14.579 --> 01:04:19.240]  We're gonna try to fix things, but we failed to stop the globalist takeover at this level.
[01:04:19.460 --> 01:04:21.160]  We knew it'd be a biological weapon attack.
[01:04:21.461 --> 01:04:23.601]  We first said it'd be a simulant to lock you down.
[01:04:23.621 --> 01:04:25.381]  Been telling you that since Endgame, 2007.
[01:04:28.122 --> 01:04:29.803]  And then the real bio-attacks come after this.
[01:04:30.363 --> 01:04:32.023]  Word for word what I've told you.
[01:04:32.543 --> 01:04:35.564]  In fact, do get that Archivist we've got that's so good at finding things.
[01:04:37.307 --> 01:04:39.953]  Get him to go back for the Bill Gates film we're making right now.
[01:04:40.073 --> 01:04:40.995]  This is his main job.
[01:04:41.155 --> 01:04:45.925]  And find all the times I said the first bio-attack will only kill maybe a couple hundred thousand worldwide.
[01:04:46.726 --> 01:04:48.370]  That'll be the simulant to lock everybody down.
[01:04:49.278 --> 01:04:54.481]  Then we'll have IDs and tracker chips and apps and drones and robots controlling us.
[01:04:54.621 --> 01:05:01.524]  And then the next wave will kill a couple hundred million and we'll really get locked down under that and legitimize the lockdown.
[01:05:01.544 --> 01:05:04.206]  And you wear your damn mask and you take your inoculation.
[01:05:04.226 --> 01:05:05.066]  We lost millions.
[01:05:05.566 --> 01:05:06.367]  I lost my mom.
[01:05:06.427 --> 01:05:07.227]  I lost my brother.
[01:05:07.647 --> 01:05:08.128]  You do it.
[01:05:08.408 --> 01:05:12.590]  You'll have the contact tracers ready, the malice enforcer brigades.
[01:05:14.918 --> 01:05:31.609]  And then after we're all locked down and behaving ourselves, they won't wait long, like five years after it's all locked down, and they've purged the anti-vaxxers, they're going to release a chemical weapon that they're going to say is biological, but they'll have the cure for themselves and they're just going to kill.
[01:05:32.423 --> 01:05:33.464]  I think they'll just go for it all.
[01:05:33.484 --> 01:05:34.864]  I think they'll kill six billion then.
[01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:35.965]  You're all dead.
[01:05:36.465 --> 01:05:47.670]  And just remember, you won't listen now, but when you're dying, flopping around like a fish, vomiting your guts out with blood coming out of your eyes, remember the devil did this to you and that Jesus is real.
[01:05:49.171 --> 01:05:50.091]  I hate censors.
[01:05:50.591 --> 01:05:51.392]  I hate tyranny.
[01:05:52.032 --> 01:05:53.052]  I love America.
[01:05:53.072 --> 01:05:55.213]  Duhasmich.
[01:05:56.894 --> 01:05:58.155]  Now, let's talk about this.
[01:05:59.562 --> 01:06:02.284]  Start of the next segment, I have a little surprise for everybody.
[01:06:03.245 --> 01:06:07.088]  You know San Antonio said they'll arrest you if you say the words Chinese virus.
[01:06:09.810 --> 01:06:12.973]  Well, let's just say we got a surprise up our sleeves.
[01:06:15.235 --> 01:06:17.317]  Coming up next segment, we'll show you what's going on.
[01:06:17.797 --> 01:06:19.859]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls here in 60 seconds.
[01:06:20.679 --> 01:06:25.683]  Just don't forget, we've got the biggest sale that we've run in the year so far.
[01:06:25.704 --> 01:06:28.105]  We won't have a sale this big, this wide.
[01:06:29.136 --> 01:06:32.538]  Until Christmas, until after Thanksgiving.
[01:06:33.659 --> 01:06:43.704]  It's basically all of our best-selling supplements, even the ones that are closest selling out, like Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, with the Preglanone, for 30 to 60% off.
[01:06:43.724 --> 01:06:47.666]  8-pack Power Stack is amazing.
[01:06:47.826 --> 01:06:48.347]  It's an a.m.
[01:06:48.387 --> 01:06:48.827]  and p.m.
[01:06:48.847 --> 01:06:51.789]  pack, 13 different pills, 13 different supplements.
[01:06:52.745 --> 01:06:59.027]  This is a way for you to give friends, family, yourself, to boost your overall body's defenses, to be healthy, to sleep better, everything.
[01:06:59.747 --> 01:07:04.988]  It's 60% off, but when they ordered it, there was a mistake last year.
[01:07:05.008 --> 01:07:06.569]  They double ordered the amount.
[01:07:06.729 --> 01:07:09.450]  Well, we've sold down now the extra amount.
[01:07:10.630 --> 01:07:12.531]  So now it's going to go back to maybe 20% off or so.
[01:07:14.298 --> 01:07:14.899]  I don't think so.
[01:07:34.758 --> 01:07:41.239]  60% off Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, 50% off Azobeat, 40% off Limited Edition InfoWars Mask, $9.95.
[01:07:41.740 --> 01:07:43.700]  Living Defense Plus, 50% off.
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:44.440]  That's so important.
[01:07:44.460 --> 01:07:45.900]  DNA Force Plus, back in stock.
[01:07:46.201 --> 01:07:47.301]  It's the number one product you should get.
[01:07:47.321 --> 01:07:50.841]  50% off X2, back in stock.
[01:07:51.402 --> 01:07:53.002]  50% off Ultimate Crillol, back in stock.
[01:07:53.242 --> 01:07:54.242]  50% off and a bunch of other things.
[01:07:54.282 --> 01:07:56.363]  Take advantage of that now and get scorable food.
[01:07:57.183 --> 01:08:02.604]  Because again, COVID-19's hyped up and we now understand the takeover plan.
[01:08:05.323 --> 01:08:09.225]  They chose a patented cold virus so they could say everybody was suspect.
[01:08:09.465 --> 01:08:11.747]  And so they can always say all deaths are being caused by it.
[01:08:11.967 --> 01:08:18.050]  It's built in so they can use the statistics and ramp them up with the normal death rates or ramp them down not counting the death rates.
[01:08:18.570 --> 01:08:20.652]  So this is all absolutely a scam.
[01:08:20.672 --> 01:08:21.532]  We've cracked the code.
[01:08:21.792 --> 01:08:22.853]  The president understands it.
[01:08:22.893 --> 01:08:23.753]  That's in the news now.
[01:08:24.334 --> 01:08:28.556]  But we got to go further than just sidelining the fraudulent Fauci NIH crime syndicate.
[01:08:28.796 --> 01:08:30.017]  They've got to be prosecuted.
[01:08:30.797 --> 01:08:35.099]  AP exclusive docs show that White House officials buried CDC report.
[01:08:35.159 --> 01:08:35.399]  No.
[01:08:36.759 --> 01:08:37.560]  He sidelined them.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.922]  He was thinking about getting rid of it completely, but instead of making them victims, he just sidelined these lying monsters.
[01:08:41.962 --> 01:08:49.705]  So Fauci, to get headlines again, goes, I'm self-quarantining because eight people in the White House tested positive for coronavirus.
[01:08:50.225 --> 01:08:53.086]  Which again, a papaya or a goat will test positive.
[01:08:53.726 --> 01:09:00.129]  This is part of him grabbing headlines again when it comes out that he jailed a top scientist that exposed him profiting off HIV drugs.
[01:09:01.869 --> 01:09:03.790]  But their attempt to silence her has only failed as well.
[01:09:04.730 --> 01:09:06.470]  Word is she's going to be testifying in Congress.
[01:09:07.030 --> 01:09:08.551]  So the globalists are in a lot of trouble.
[01:09:08.851 --> 01:09:10.931]  The problem is they're going to launch even bigger attacks now.
[01:09:11.392 --> 01:09:13.172]  What's coming next after the COVID hoax?
[01:09:13.752 --> 01:09:14.392]  Depression!
[01:09:14.592 --> 01:09:15.873]  And then more COVID hoax!
[01:09:16.293 --> 01:09:19.354]  Because it's built in because it's the cold virus.
[01:09:20.694 --> 01:09:21.414]  Unbelievable.
[01:09:22.154 --> 01:09:22.514]  Okay.
[01:09:25.555 --> 01:09:26.816]  Makayla in Florida.
[01:09:26.856 --> 01:09:27.856]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:09:27.896 --> 01:09:28.156]  Welcome.
[01:09:29.455 --> 01:09:34.962]  Hi, I just want to say I've been watching you since 2014 and you're so brave and you're such an inspiration.
[01:09:35.643 --> 01:09:38.767]  What can we do to wake up fellow Americans to what's going on?
[01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:41.612]  Well, Michaela, let me just say something.
[01:09:41.672 --> 01:09:42.493]  I'm not brave.
[01:09:42.693 --> 01:09:51.781]  I'd have to be stupidly brave when they're coming with forced inoculations, world government, pedophilia, total Satanism, to like go along with it.
[01:09:51.841 --> 01:10:01.831]  I mean, you and I, all of us are like together in this, like in Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the walls are closing in on us, and we're just trying to get out of this, you know?
[01:10:01.851 --> 01:10:04.774]  Yeah, I'm crying on the phone at work, so.
[01:10:06.397 --> 01:10:07.298]  Well, we should be crying.
[01:10:07.318 --> 01:10:08.179]  You know, I'll be honest with you.
[01:10:08.199 --> 01:10:09.840]  I've cried for my children at night.
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:10.661]  I just can't help it.
[01:10:10.961 --> 01:10:11.441]  I've cried.
[01:10:11.922 --> 01:10:13.063]  And I'm not somebody that cries a lot.
[01:10:13.083 --> 01:10:13.763]  I usually cry on air.
[01:10:13.783 --> 01:10:15.024]  I think about grandparents or something.
[01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:17.727]  But I've been having tears of concern.
[01:10:18.407 --> 01:10:20.029]  Quietly, just tears start coming out.
[01:10:20.369 --> 01:10:24.032]  I'm not sobbing, but I'm really going through grief.
[01:10:24.092 --> 01:10:25.433]  We should all be going through grief.
[01:10:25.693 --> 01:10:27.255]  We're going into a hardcore tyranny.
[01:10:27.295 --> 01:10:28.295]  We're all in grave danger.
[01:10:29.336 --> 01:10:30.377]  It says you're a medical worker.
[01:10:30.417 --> 01:10:31.378]  What's your view on the lockdown?
[01:10:32.219 --> 01:10:34.681]  I just check in patients at an MRI office.
[01:10:37.401 --> 01:10:38.481]  What is your view on all this?
[01:10:39.121 --> 01:10:39.722]  My view?
[01:10:40.322 --> 01:10:41.462]  It's over-exaggerated.
[01:10:43.503 --> 01:10:45.663]  What do the doctors and other medical workers around you think?
[01:10:45.703 --> 01:10:46.444]  What's the consensus?
[01:10:47.704 --> 01:10:49.564]  They're just taking extreme precautions.
[01:10:49.624 --> 01:10:51.065]  I feel like it's half and half.
[01:10:51.105 --> 01:10:52.345]  Some of them are buying into it.
[01:10:52.365 --> 01:10:52.965]  Some aren't.
[01:10:56.666 --> 01:10:58.027]  Well, I appreciate you calling today.
[01:10:58.047 --> 01:10:58.907]  Anything else on your mind?
[01:10:59.567 --> 01:10:59.807]  No.
[01:11:00.628 --> 01:11:01.728]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:11:02.495 --> 01:11:03.456]  I appreciate you calling.
[01:11:04.256 --> 01:11:07.098]  And again, I said I'm not going to say thanks for calling, but then I do still say it.
[01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:07.879]  It burns up times.
[01:11:07.899 --> 01:11:08.760]  Let's just go to the callers.
[01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:09.340]  I love you all.
[01:11:10.061 --> 01:11:12.983]  Angela, or no, that's Angel, in Florida.
[01:11:13.003 --> 01:11:13.443]  You're on the air.
[01:11:13.463 --> 01:11:13.803]  Go ahead.
[01:11:14.844 --> 01:11:15.304]  How are you?
[01:11:15.665 --> 01:11:16.125]  Welcome, sir.
[01:11:16.145 --> 01:11:18.166]  It says you're an immigrant on the Venezuela situation.
[01:11:18.206 --> 01:11:18.507]  Go ahead.
[01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:19.547]  Yeah, man.
[01:11:19.848 --> 01:11:24.311]  I've been hearing you for some time, and I really admire you and what you're doing.
[01:11:25.131 --> 01:11:33.734]  I came to this country, I'm an immigrant, and I'm from Venezuela, and what I'm looking at in my country is pretty much a pilot program for global control.
[01:11:34.534 --> 01:11:45.597]  And what happened is the Chinese took over our resources over there, like the government, the corrupt government, they sold like 10, 20 years of oil without taking it out.
[01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:51.298]  So the Chinese government, they give the money, so they own the land and the extraction.
[01:11:51.999 --> 01:11:53.159]  So the problem is that
[01:11:53.655 --> 01:11:55.216]  The United States is very hard for the U.S.
[01:11:55.256 --> 01:12:02.860]  to get in the country and help us because the Chinese are there and they don't allow anyone to come in because they have investments in the country.
[01:12:03.481 --> 01:12:10.605]  So what happens is the government is having the Chinese as a shield, protection, because now they know no one can touch them.
[01:12:11.265 --> 01:12:13.727]  And that's pretty much what is happening in the country.
[01:12:15.147 --> 01:12:16.228]  There's a lot of starvation.
[01:12:16.248 --> 01:12:22.312]  I have my family over there and I've been sending food over there and the situation there, COVID-19,
[01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:25.571]  For them, it's nothing against what is going on.
[01:12:26.052 --> 01:12:32.736]  The level of starvation and people dying because they don't have access to the hospitals or anything else.
[01:12:33.256 --> 01:12:34.157]  No access at all.
[01:12:34.257 --> 01:12:36.358]  I mean, what is happening over there is amazing.
[01:12:36.498 --> 01:12:36.999]  It's amazing.
[01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:38.259]  People are dying every day.
[01:12:38.339 --> 01:12:39.340]  Thousands of people are dying.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.301]  And by the way, what you're saying is accurate.
[01:12:41.321 --> 01:12:44.643]  I remember five years ago they were saying 2,000 die a week of starvation.
[01:12:44.663 --> 01:12:46.064]  I'm hearing those numbers are way up.
[01:12:47.205 --> 01:12:49.226]  The zoo animals were eaten many years ago.
[01:12:49.667 --> 01:12:51.408]  Communist China has praised
[01:12:52.448 --> 01:13:06.920]  Your dictator Maduro, he's traveled to Beijing and been praised by Xi Jinping, and I know you're one of the richest countries resources-wise in the world, but under communism you've been stripped down to nothing, and now they're just preying on you.
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:07.580]  It's so sad.
[01:13:08.481 --> 01:13:13.986]  Yeah, I mean, we didn't have the need to immigrate to any country.
[01:13:14.246 --> 01:13:20.751]  Our country was so rich that we didn't have the need to immigrate anywhere, so we're the biggest diaspora right now in the whole world.
[01:13:21.491 --> 01:13:24.372]  We have more than 5 million people out of the country.
[01:13:24.912 --> 01:13:33.595]  So what I'm saying is that there's a big global elite behind this, like the Global Economic Forum and the IMF.
[01:13:33.975 --> 01:13:37.756]  The IMF is getting so much profit about all this, what is happening.
[01:13:38.396 --> 01:13:44.758]  And I remember that they are the ones that give the money or give the debts to our countries.
[01:13:45.298 --> 01:13:47.259]  And now we're like a slave for them.
[01:13:47.619 --> 01:13:50.400]  Behind everything that is happening in the US, the IMF,
[01:13:50.905 --> 01:13:53.026]  And the global economic form is behind this.
[01:13:53.167 --> 01:13:57.269]  It's very hard to get out of this because it's a huge... Well, that's right.
[01:13:57.329 --> 01:14:05.695]  And then people like Sean Penn go and praise Hugo Chavez and Maduro when they literally live in palaces and have enslaved the people and destroyed the middle class.
[01:14:06.776 --> 01:14:11.699]  And then it's the communists that work with the IMF and World Bank to actually exploit them.
[01:14:11.739 --> 01:14:16.702]  So it's crony capitalists working with communists to oppress their people.
[01:14:16.762 --> 01:14:17.783]  It's absolutely sick.
[01:14:18.789 --> 01:14:20.110]  Hey Alex, and you know what happened?
[01:14:20.191 --> 01:14:28.159]  When you go to Europe and you ask for what is going on in Venezuela, for the whole European mind, everything that is happening in Venezuela is correct.
[01:14:28.179 --> 01:14:30.682]  We have the best health system.
[01:14:30.722 --> 01:14:32.844]  We have the best leadership.
[01:14:33.553 --> 01:14:41.901]  But these people are all socialists and communists, and all that leadership in Europe and Asia, they praise what is happening in Venezuela.
[01:14:42.401 --> 01:14:45.664]  But what's happening is that we are the model.
[01:14:45.904 --> 01:14:52.831]  We're a pilot model for them, because that's exactly how they want to control the whole population, by telling them what to eat and what not to eat.
[01:14:53.171 --> 01:14:54.853]  And the government is the one that gives the food.
[01:14:56.351 --> 01:14:59.373]  In fact, they make people pray to Hugo Chavez to get their school lunches.
[01:14:59.413 --> 01:15:00.214]  God bless you, Angel.
[01:15:00.234 --> 01:15:02.075]  All right, powerful call.
[01:15:02.736 --> 01:15:08.780]  David, Casey, Sy, Jordan, Brett, Greg, Tyler, your calls are all straight ahead.
[01:15:09.741 --> 01:15:13.184]  Brett wants to make the point that all the big shops are closed and all the small ones are locked down.
[01:15:13.504 --> 01:15:14.665]  How obvious is this?
[01:15:15.085 --> 01:15:16.907]  It's a total global corporate takeover.
[01:15:17.167 --> 01:15:17.767]  We'll be right back.
[01:15:18.608 --> 01:15:22.351]  All right, David Icke has now been unpersoned like I was two years ago.
[01:15:24.332 --> 01:15:30.053]  And I've invited him to do a show here on the weekend or whenever he wants, because that's who we want on air, is who's been deplatformed.
[01:15:30.073 --> 01:15:31.754]  That's why Banned.Video is so incredible.
[01:15:31.774 --> 01:15:35.995]  We've got the press conferences that medical doctors have exposing COVID-19 as a hoax.
[01:15:37.115 --> 01:15:40.776]  We've got the videos from Cedars-Sinai that have been banned up there.
[01:15:40.836 --> 01:15:46.217]  We've got the documentary that's been banned off dozens of platforms.
[01:15:46.597 --> 01:15:49.058]  Doctors in Black up at Banned.Video.
[01:15:49.238 --> 01:15:50.038]  That's what we're doing.
[01:15:50.058 --> 01:15:52.659]  In fact, we should create a section that's Banned Films.
[01:15:53.404 --> 01:15:55.888]  Because all the films we've got are kind of scattered around.
[01:15:55.908 --> 01:15:57.631]  We should put them all in one place.
[01:15:57.691 --> 01:15:59.834]  There's so much on the site every day.
[01:16:00.114 --> 01:16:00.876]  And the site's free!
[01:16:02.077 --> 01:16:04.541]  That's why you buy the products, finances, all of this.
[01:16:04.581 --> 01:16:08.427]  And our bandwidth costs are just off the charts right now because
[01:16:09.736 --> 01:16:16.102]  As censorship explodes, people are driven to info wars now, which is not what I wanted to happen, but I knew it would happen.
[01:16:16.662 --> 01:16:18.404]  Two years ago, people said, how are you handling this?
[01:16:18.464 --> 01:16:29.213]  I said, we're going to get in place and have our own independent system of folks support us, because when it gets really bad, they make their big power move, probably with a controlled bioweapon release to bring in world government and world ID.
[01:16:29.494 --> 01:16:30.615]  We've got to stay on air to fight it.
[01:16:31.295 --> 01:16:34.659]  And now, here we are, inside the dystopia.
[01:16:35.039 --> 01:16:36.140]  It's not theoretical now.
[01:16:36.481 --> 01:16:40.345]  World government, forced inoculation, forced microchipping being announced.
[01:16:40.925 --> 01:16:43.969]  In Israel, in Sweden, it's all going down.
[01:16:46.792 --> 01:16:48.894]  Cy in Florida, then Tyler, then Brett.
[01:16:49.174 --> 01:16:50.396]  Cy, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.401]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on.
[01:16:52.901 --> 01:16:59.165]  Hey listen, I just wanted to basically go over the falsifying of the numbers by the CDC and then obviously the World Health Organization.
[01:16:59.445 --> 01:17:01.446]  And then you've got all of America on house arrest.
[01:17:01.746 --> 01:17:02.887]  It's not even a quarantine, you know.
[01:17:02.907 --> 01:17:04.488]  Quarantine is for sick people.
[01:17:04.868 --> 01:17:06.129]  I wish people would get that through their head.
[01:17:06.209 --> 01:17:06.729]  Exactly!
[01:17:06.749 --> 01:17:09.271]  You usually quarantine who's sick and confirmed.
[01:17:09.651 --> 01:17:11.072]  Instead we're all locked down.
[01:17:11.292 --> 01:17:12.473]  This has never been done before.
[01:17:13.313 --> 01:17:13.714]  That's right.
[01:17:13.994 --> 01:17:16.515]  And then also you've got, I mean this is all a part of the lockstep like you said.
[01:17:16.535 --> 01:17:17.556]  You always preach it, you know.
[01:17:17.976 --> 01:17:20.698]  All about the Rockefeller Foundation and then you've got the Bilderberg meetings.
[01:17:21.218 --> 01:17:26.802]  Listen, this is also the same people that are pushing for lockdown are the same ones pushing for everybody on a fixed income.
[01:17:26.822 --> 01:17:32.205]  You got socialism, mass inoculation of the people, the open borders, mass abortions, child sacrifice.
[01:17:32.386 --> 01:17:34.347]  I mean, the list goes on, Alex.
[01:17:34.387 --> 01:17:34.847]  You already know.
[01:17:35.287 --> 01:17:37.029]  But, you know, it's so funny.
[01:17:37.089 --> 01:17:43.613]  Before this whole thing happened, you had the Trump rallies packed out, and now you've got people, you know, vying for everything.
[01:17:43.633 --> 01:17:46.595]  Let's just shoot it over to Zoom and have everybody speak online.
[01:17:47.035 --> 01:17:48.036]  I just think it's very funny.
[01:17:52.261 --> 01:17:55.282]  They're switching the train from one train to the other, teaching you.
[01:17:55.302 --> 01:17:56.523]  You don't go out and get a job.
[01:17:56.563 --> 01:17:57.623]  You don't go out and start a business.
[01:17:58.023 --> 01:18:00.844]  You work for us, but you're obsolete.
[01:18:00.984 --> 01:18:02.945]  People need to understand this is an admitted trap.
[01:18:03.385 --> 01:18:08.447]  And the Democrats and the Hollywood scum have jumped the gun.
[01:18:08.487 --> 01:18:10.728]  They're admitting, oh, this is good for the earth.
[01:18:11.268 --> 01:18:13.209]  It's good that the old economy is going away.
[01:18:13.549 --> 01:18:15.310]  Well, how obvious is that, my friend?
[01:18:15.610 --> 01:18:17.291]  How do you think it's going for them, Cy?
[01:18:18.274 --> 01:18:20.255]  Yeah, and now you can see everybody's true colors.
[01:18:20.315 --> 01:18:21.575]  Each state's a little bit different, you know.
[01:18:21.855 --> 01:18:24.916]  They put in a certain governor, and now you see whose side they're on.
[01:18:24.936 --> 01:18:27.817]  So it's really, actually, and a lot of this is about a lot of good things for light.
[01:18:28.277 --> 01:18:32.999]  But you've got, you know, people like, even the FBI and the CIA, they're all militarized, you know, operations.
[01:18:33.179 --> 01:18:38.301]  So, I mean, just to see, it's really, it's really not even about a Republican and a Democrat anymore.
[01:18:38.321 --> 01:18:40.062]  It's a fight between light and darkness.
[01:18:40.462 --> 01:18:43.903]  Well, that's right, and everybody in the agencies and the corporations have to understand
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:46.681]  Governments are going to be made obsolete.
[01:18:46.801 --> 01:18:48.242]  The family's being made obsolete.
[01:18:48.503 --> 01:18:50.944]  You can pretend you're going along with this to be in charge.
[01:18:51.305 --> 01:18:52.606]  You're a schmuck if you do that.
[01:18:53.046 --> 01:18:54.307]  We have to resist this.
[01:18:54.327 --> 01:18:55.848]  This is an anti-human takeover.
[01:18:55.888 --> 01:18:56.989]  Cy, great points.
[01:18:57.469 --> 01:18:59.431]  Tyler in Arizona says his wife's a nurse.
[01:18:59.951 --> 01:19:00.992]  Tell us what's going on, Tyler.
[01:19:02.053 --> 01:19:03.534]  Alex, what a pleasure to talk to you, Bob.
[01:19:04.034 --> 01:19:05.075]  Yeah, my wife is a nurse.
[01:19:05.095 --> 01:19:09.599]  She's pregnant, about six months pregnant with my second child, a little girl coming out.
[01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:12.120]  It's going to be really interesting to see how that unfolds.
[01:19:13.806 --> 01:19:22.129]  You know, that being said, she's taken standby, which is, you know, leaving, you know, you get to leave without pay or whatever, just, you know, you take the day off.
[01:19:22.929 --> 01:19:38.714]  She's taken standby three, four, maybe five times since this pandemic's come off, and that's because they were exactly like you predicted, slowly but surely furloughing and laying off their employees because they weren't having the income rate, because the hospitals are slow and empty.
[01:19:43.149 --> 01:19:43.669]  Absolutely.
[01:19:43.709 --> 01:19:47.450]  Remember a few months ago, we'd show all the footage of the empty hospitals and they said it was a lie.
[01:19:47.470 --> 01:19:54.373]  We showed the footage that looked like fake hazmat gear crews and it turns out those very hospitals were staging events with CBS News.
[01:19:54.433 --> 01:19:57.294]  I mean, how long can the media get caught staging things?
[01:19:59.234 --> 01:20:00.455]  As long as we let them, boss.
[01:20:00.735 --> 01:20:02.215]  What was the president that said?
[01:20:02.235 --> 01:20:04.396]  I think it was James Madison.
[01:20:04.416 --> 01:20:06.297]  He said, how long, how far would charity go?
[01:20:06.397 --> 01:20:07.257]  As far as we let them go.
[01:20:08.919 --> 01:20:09.560]  That's it, brother.
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.161]  God bless you.
[01:20:10.202 --> 01:20:11.123]  I appreciate your call.
[01:20:11.684 --> 01:20:13.488]  Senator Rand Paul just put out a tweet.
[01:20:13.728 --> 01:20:14.169]  Oh, look!
[01:20:14.510 --> 01:20:18.458]  The anti-real Donald Trump Deep State just signed their names to a public letter.
[01:20:18.878 --> 01:20:20.361]  ABC News, Justice Department.
[01:20:21.203 --> 01:20:42.109]  Nearly 2,000 Justice Department officials have signed onto a letter calling for Attorney General William Barr to resign over what they describe as an improper intervention in the criminal case of former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, who did nothing wrong, who they said they were targeting to get fired, who they then set up and threatened to put his son in prison if he didn't plead guilty to a crime he didn't commit.
[01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:47.271]  And these 2,000 criminals, commanded by Comey and Obama and the deep state,
[01:20:48.956 --> 01:20:51.240]  Are the list of the people that need to have their asses fired.
[01:20:51.260 --> 01:20:55.589]  Nearly 2,000 former DOJ officials called for AG Barr to resign over Flynn case.
[01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:56.931]  ABC News.
[01:20:59.171 --> 01:21:00.552]  Unbelievable.
[01:21:01.453 --> 01:21:02.894]  They've just started fighting, folks.
[01:21:03.494 --> 01:21:04.335]  They're not going to give up.
[01:21:04.595 --> 01:21:05.536]  They're CHICOM-funded.
[01:21:05.556 --> 01:21:06.696]  They've committed so many crimes.
[01:21:07.277 --> 01:21:09.018]  They're totally committed to bringing this country down.
[01:21:09.959 --> 01:21:10.999]  They're not FBI agents.
[01:21:11.019 --> 01:21:12.280]  They're not just department officials.
[01:21:12.721 --> 01:21:13.481]  They're globalists.
[01:21:13.561 --> 01:21:15.462]  The globalists want America gone.
[01:21:15.703 --> 01:21:16.643]  They want a depression.
[01:21:17.324 --> 01:21:24.689]  Everybody out there in private life, in corporations, in the government, you better decide right now which side you're on, and you better be heard!
[01:21:26.910 --> 01:21:27.591]  It's that simple.
[01:21:30.794 --> 01:21:31.854]  And again, you can't argue with me.
[01:21:31.894 --> 01:21:33.755]  I'm dressed like Bill Gates in a non-threatening pink sweater.
[01:21:33.775 --> 01:21:36.776]  So even though I'm going to eat my neighbors, it's okay.
[01:21:36.796 --> 01:21:37.616]  I'm wearing a pink sweater.
[01:21:38.496 --> 01:21:39.077]  Eat your neighbors?
[01:21:39.157 --> 01:21:42.018]  Again, that's Jonathan Swift.
[01:21:42.258 --> 01:21:43.058]  Modest proposal.
[01:21:43.078 --> 01:21:44.858]  Don't want to really eat the neighbors.
[01:21:44.998 --> 01:21:46.159]  I want the collapse to stop.
[01:21:46.479 --> 01:21:47.579]  It is causing mass death.
[01:21:47.979 --> 01:21:52.541]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Brett in Chicago.
[01:21:52.841 --> 01:21:53.641]  You're on the air, Brett.
[01:21:53.661 --> 01:21:53.981]  Thank you.
[01:21:54.421 --> 01:21:56.102]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:21:56.894 --> 01:22:00.736]  Man, I am just seeing everything we knew they were building behind the scenes emerge.
[01:22:01.156 --> 01:22:02.557]  I knew exactly what they do.
[01:22:02.897 --> 01:22:07.939]  So it's not a surprise, but it still is a surprise because I can't believe they're really that evil, brother.
[01:22:08.939 --> 01:22:09.760]  Oh, they are that evil.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:10.340]  Think about it.
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:13.301]  So I guess two things I want to get across here.
[01:22:13.321 --> 01:22:19.304]  The one thing in Chicago, you know, you look at the Walmart, there's no social distancing at all going on there.
[01:22:19.524 --> 01:22:20.925]  They're letting people in by the herd.
[01:22:21.265 --> 01:22:21.885]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:22:22.912 --> 01:22:29.058]  It's insane, you know, and then you got the local mom-and-pop shop down the street, and they're closed down.
[01:22:29.318 --> 01:22:31.440]  Sir, 15,000 people a day fly into the UK.
[01:22:31.861 --> 01:22:33.582]  Over 50,000 drive in.
[01:22:34.223 --> 01:22:34.703]  The Channel.
[01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:36.325]  No one's being checked.
[01:22:37.065 --> 01:22:38.346]  But you can't leave your house.
[01:22:38.386 --> 01:22:40.809]  They'll grab a woman and slam her head in the ground.
[01:22:41.689 --> 01:22:44.112]  But you can fly in all you want.
[01:22:44.232 --> 01:22:44.992]  It's a hoax.
[01:22:45.353 --> 01:22:47.575]  You can fly from Wuhan to London.
[01:22:49.147 --> 01:22:52.772]  And all, it's in the news that the British police won't mess with you if you're Asian.
[01:22:53.292 --> 01:22:56.757]  But if you're white, you're done because you're there to be taught you're scum.
[01:22:56.777 --> 01:22:57.377]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:22:58.118 --> 01:23:02.404]  And then the mayor of Chicago wants to say, she's gonna, she's gonna prosecute us.
[01:23:02.424 --> 01:23:03.986]  We're criminals, we're this, we're that.
[01:23:04.006 --> 01:23:06.549]  But then she gets caught going to an illegal hair salon.
[01:23:07.521 --> 01:23:08.381]  Exactly, right?
[01:23:08.442 --> 01:23:11.363]  And then, but of course, you know, let's open up Walmart.
[01:23:11.903 --> 01:23:13.964]  Everyone shop at Walmart, Walmart, Walmart.
[01:23:14.084 --> 01:23:15.965]  Big corporations, big corporations.
[01:23:16.566 --> 01:23:19.187]  Yeah, they're waging war against small mom and pops.
[01:23:19.207 --> 01:23:23.089]  That's why in the future, I used to go to the grocery store, the regular one.
[01:23:23.189 --> 01:23:28.431]  I've told my wife, and she agreed with me, I said, let's just practice going to this little bodega down the street.
[01:23:28.572 --> 01:23:32.493]  It costs more because they can't scale up, but let's try to just eat food out of there.
[01:23:33.014 --> 01:23:34.875]  And so we've stopped going to the big grocery stores.
[01:23:35.755 --> 01:23:40.658]  I mean, I never go in Target, hardly ever, or Walmart, but now I'm done with all of them.
[01:23:40.738 --> 01:23:44.841]  I'm done with all chains, all big hotels, all the big establishments.
[01:23:45.261 --> 01:23:46.362]  You want to wage war on me?
[01:23:46.382 --> 01:23:47.603]  I wage war on you!
[01:23:50.137 --> 01:23:51.098]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:24:13.979 --> 01:24:16.080]  Oh, he's super creepy and super evil.
[01:24:17.060 --> 01:24:22.181]  And he's up there telling college commencements where there's no people.
[01:24:22.781 --> 01:24:24.222]  You know, you are the chosen ones.
[01:24:24.262 --> 01:24:25.982]  You're like World War combat vets.
[01:24:26.022 --> 01:24:27.123]  You survived this.
[01:24:27.463 --> 01:24:30.143]  And it's all a giant hoax on record.
[01:24:30.223 --> 01:24:32.484]  We must expose the hoax or be totally enslaved.
[01:24:32.804 --> 01:24:33.804]  This is their big play.
[01:24:34.224 --> 01:24:35.205]  This is their big move.
[01:24:35.285 --> 01:24:35.925]  They use fear.
[01:24:35.965 --> 01:24:36.705]  They use control.
[01:24:36.745 --> 01:24:37.605]  They use compliance.
[01:24:37.925 --> 01:24:39.066]  We must say no, Brett.
[01:24:39.086 --> 01:24:39.606]  God bless you.
[01:24:40.549 --> 01:24:45.811]  All right, I got David, and I got Casey, and I got Bob, and I got Mike, and I got Greg, and I got Ryan, and I want to get to all of you.
[01:24:46.411 --> 01:24:48.292]  And David Icke says he can only do an hour with us.
[01:24:49.892 --> 01:25:00.176]  And I also have this Bill Gates piece that we put together that I want to play, and we have a very special video that I'm going to premiere at 6 after in the fourth hour.
[01:25:00.196 --> 01:25:00.976]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:25:01.016 --> 01:25:01.896]  Believe me, it's important.
[01:25:02.977 --> 01:25:04.137]  But what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to break.
[01:25:04.157 --> 01:25:07.018]  I'm going to come back and jam a few more calls in this next segment.
[01:25:08.405 --> 01:25:10.426]  Ahead of David Icke.
[01:25:11.546 --> 01:25:16.489]  And again, if you're a TV viewer, I'm wearing a pink Bill Gates shirt, which means you can trust me.
[01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:20.591]  Now, the vaccine's gonna kill 700,000 people.
[01:25:20.631 --> 01:25:22.051]  He admitted that, or maimed them.
[01:25:22.512 --> 01:25:23.192]  But it's okay.
[01:25:23.312 --> 01:25:24.893]  I'm wearing a pink shirt.
[01:25:25.793 --> 01:25:27.174]  And Bill Gates can't argue with me either.
[01:25:27.554 --> 01:25:29.535]  Bill Gates, you're a eugenicist, you're a criminal.
[01:25:30.155 --> 01:25:30.755]  You can't argue.
[01:25:30.775 --> 01:25:31.976]  I'm not threatening wearing a pink shirt.
[01:25:32.736 --> 01:25:33.016]  You see?
[01:25:33.657 --> 01:25:36.318]  Only one thing trumps Gates, and that's a pink shirt.
[01:25:37.461 --> 01:25:53.655]  And just like that, world governments announced forced inoculations and plentiful microchips, tracer teams to come inspect your home, mothers having their children pulled out of their arms, screaming and crying, taken away to prison camps because they dared go out on the street.
[01:25:54.576 --> 01:25:58.960]  Oh, but the borders are open and the flights are wide open, and the tunnel
[01:26:00.114 --> 01:26:00.314]  Hey Alex.
[01:26:00.334 --> 01:26:04.275]  Hey I was at the Walmart just now and you know how they have the cattle guards out and the little
[01:26:28.484 --> 01:26:33.287]  The people with their masks on and their little tablets?
[01:26:33.727 --> 01:26:34.427]  Yes.
[01:26:34.567 --> 01:26:38.069]  So I asked the guy, I said, hey, what are you doing with that tablet there?
[01:26:38.229 --> 01:26:42.572]  Are you checking to, are you marking down whether people have masks on or not?
[01:26:43.552 --> 01:26:45.453]  And he said, actually, yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[01:26:46.354 --> 01:26:48.415]  I said, well, who gets that information?
[01:26:48.435 --> 01:26:49.596]  Oh, it goes to corporate.
[01:26:50.136 --> 01:26:56.059]  And then I'd assume corporate's giving it to the CDC and the National Health Institute.
[01:26:56.479 --> 01:26:57.340]  I said, oh, really?
[01:26:57.947 --> 01:26:58.987]  Well, that's good to know.
[01:26:59.688 --> 01:27:02.688]  I said, why don't you tell Bill Gates to kiss my you-know-what?
[01:27:03.289 --> 01:27:05.409]  And why don't you tell corporate to knock this off?
[01:27:06.109 --> 01:27:08.810]  And, uh, because it's like, it's communism.
[01:27:08.830 --> 01:27:10.571]  This is like the beginning of communism.
[01:27:10.671 --> 01:27:14.692]  Well, what it really is is the merger of the government and corporations is fascism.
[01:27:15.012 --> 01:27:15.452]  But you're right.
[01:27:15.492 --> 01:27:16.592]  They call it communism.
[01:27:16.632 --> 01:27:18.613]  It's communist nomenclature at the grassroots.
[01:27:18.633 --> 01:27:21.854]  But it's really corporate fascism sitting up on top of it.
[01:27:21.894 --> 01:27:22.994]  Thank you so much, David.
[01:27:23.014 --> 01:27:23.554]  God bless you.
[01:27:24.035 --> 01:27:25.175]  Shoot video of it next time.
[01:27:27.082 --> 01:27:30.464]  Again, Walmart already de-industrialized and shut down our farming communities.
[01:27:31.305 --> 01:27:35.127]  And now they're leveraging their power, and Big Tech's leveraging their power to surveil us.
[01:27:35.327 --> 01:27:36.588]  They were always gonna abuse it.
[01:27:37.128 --> 01:27:39.950]  And now that they think they've got enough power, they're censoring everybody.
[01:27:40.030 --> 01:27:42.092]  Medical doctors, scientists.
[01:27:43.232 --> 01:27:45.514]  There's all these medical doctors, all these scientists.
[01:27:45.994 --> 01:27:51.578]  You know, in Hamburg, the head coroner's come out and said, everybody dying has two or three deadly diseases.
[01:27:51.598 --> 01:27:52.338]  The average age is 80.
[01:27:52.578 --> 01:27:54.700]  YouTube took that video down.
[01:27:55.779 --> 01:27:57.460]  Another doctor stood up at a rally in L.A.
[01:27:57.500 --> 01:27:58.600]  last week, said it's all fraud.
[01:27:58.801 --> 01:27:59.801]  They took that video down.
[01:28:01.142 --> 01:28:03.363]  Cedars-Sinai said Trump was right about light therapy.
[01:28:03.843 --> 01:28:05.084]  Cedars-Sinai can't talk.
[01:28:05.604 --> 01:28:06.325]  Only the U.N.
[01:28:06.345 --> 01:28:10.026]  and Bill and Melinda Gates and John Hopkins that all cooked up the fraud together.
[01:28:11.167 --> 01:28:13.989]  Click just like that, you're inside The Trap with David Icke, who's joining us.
[01:28:14.249 --> 01:28:16.490]  The next segment is Trailblazing Exposed.
[01:28:16.770 --> 01:28:18.491]  Bob in Florida, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:28:18.511 --> 01:28:18.891]  Go ahead.
[01:28:19.491 --> 01:28:19.832]  Hey, buddy.
[01:28:19.852 --> 01:28:20.392]  How you doing?
[01:28:21.502 --> 01:28:23.723]  Hey listen, I've been thinking about this.
[01:28:24.744 --> 01:28:29.586]  The hospital's taking money for the COVID payments for patients.
[01:28:30.026 --> 01:28:36.549]  So they get to what, the $13,000 if they label a patient as COVID and then they get the $39,000 if they put a ventilator tube in them?
[01:28:38.191 --> 01:28:47.040]  Yes, and then if they have so many, depending on the size of the hospital, they get millions of dollars, hundreds of thousands to millions, depending if they shut their hospital down and just make it about COVID.
[01:28:47.301 --> 01:28:50.224]  That's why they're all empty, because there's not that many COVID patients.
[01:28:50.264 --> 01:28:59.273]  So then they incentivize to say everyone coming in has COVID, which the main test they've done in about 90% of the cases just tests for genetic material that almost everyone has in it.
[01:28:59.293 --> 01:29:00.534]  That's why the Tanzanian president
[01:29:01.445 --> 01:29:04.286]  Well, my question is, where is that money coming from?
[01:29:04.306 --> 01:29:05.266]  Who's coughing up that money?
[01:29:25.009 --> 01:29:28.170]  But doesn't that make the hospitals complicit in the cover-up?
[01:29:28.630 --> 01:29:30.871]  Sir, it is a massive criminal conspiracy.
[01:29:31.232 --> 01:29:33.653]  And I gotta say, red states are corrupt, but nothing compared to blue.
[01:29:34.073 --> 01:29:36.074]  You notice almost all the deaths are, like, in New York.
[01:29:36.914 --> 01:29:39.735]  That's because New York is just so corrupt it'll make your head spin.
[01:29:39.775 --> 01:29:40.515]  No one denies that.
[01:29:40.575 --> 01:29:41.696]  It is a cesspit of evil.
[01:29:42.156 --> 01:29:44.177]  A lot of good folks live there, but the people in charge are evil.
[01:29:44.697 --> 01:29:47.218]  They are listing everyone that dies as COVID.
[01:29:47.478 --> 01:29:51.620]  And Project Veritas has funeral homeowners and others confirming it, and nurses.
[01:29:52.955 --> 01:29:57.839]  And CBS just got caught staging people coming in and staging vehicles.
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:07.047]  We reported that two months ago, and I got a threatening phone call from some folks saying, we're gonna sue you, you claim our hospital's doing that.
[01:30:07.307 --> 01:30:09.449]  Turns out, it was fake at that hospital.
[01:30:10.205 --> 01:30:13.148]  So it's just because people be out front, they notice no one would be there for days.
[01:30:13.468 --> 01:30:19.915]  All of a sudden, 20 people in hazmat suits and a line of cars for the media and the same people were going in and out in circles.
[01:30:20.956 --> 01:30:28.844]  David Icke, who has now reached that epic level as only few have been totally banned on the internet, joins us straight ahead.
[01:30:28.904 --> 01:30:29.885]  Stay with us in 60 seconds.
[01:30:31.471 --> 01:30:34.073]  Let's hear from Boris Johnson last night.
[01:30:34.113 --> 01:30:36.215]  That's the first thing that David Icke wants to get into.
[01:30:36.255 --> 01:30:44.902]  Announcing a national tracking code system for COVID-19 and other diseases into the future and when you're allowed to leave your home.
[01:30:44.942 --> 01:30:50.006]  A national poll says 90% of Britons don't ever want to leave their houses again.
[01:30:50.086 --> 01:30:50.606]  Here it is.
[01:30:51.747 --> 01:30:57.912]  It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom.
[01:30:58.512 --> 01:30:59.113]  Your freedom.
[01:30:59.813 --> 01:31:03.255]  Of a kind that we have never seen before in peace or war.
[01:31:04.195 --> 01:31:08.338]  And you have shown the good sense to support those rules overwhelmingly.
[01:31:08.658 --> 01:31:25.807]  You've put up with all the hardships of that programme of social distancing because you understand that as things stand, and as the experience of every other country has shown, it's the only way to defeat the coronavirus, the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime.
[01:31:26.883 --> 01:31:42.517]  And though the death toll has been tragic and the suffering immense, and though we grieve for all those we have lost, it is a fact that by adopting those measures we prevented this country from being engulfed by what could
[01:31:43.775 --> 01:31:48.540]  So they took everybody's rights away and kept us all from being engulfed by mass death.
[01:31:48.580 --> 01:31:52.103]  So, doesn't matter the projections were 50 times, 30 times, 20 times off.
[01:31:52.423 --> 01:31:56.047]  Doesn't matter it was all fraud and they're counting all the regular deaths as COVID-19.
[01:31:56.547 --> 01:32:08.639]  Oh no, no, them taking all your rights is the reason they weren't completely engulfed, but now it's a permanent emergency and there's this, the big tech companies already have the apps that are going to track you in real time and right where David
[01:32:09.519 --> 01:32:12.740]  Ike lives in the UK, is where they first are pilot testing it.
[01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:20.482]  So David, you've been a very busy man after being banned off Facebook, being banned off of YouTube for refusing to stay silent.
[01:32:20.502 --> 01:32:26.224]  But you were saying this months ago, you've been vindicated by all the doctors and scientists and epidemiologists and...
[01:32:26.724 --> 01:32:39.235]  Coroners coming out and saying, you're absolutely right, no one's dying of COVID, they just are infected with something like COVID, a coronavirus, and so they're attributing basically anybody that's ever had a cold to coronavirus when they die.
[01:32:40.916 --> 01:32:50.585]  Yeah, I mean, that statement last night from Boris Johnson, unfortunately I missed the last part because I was throwing up at the time.
[01:32:51.394 --> 01:32:53.876]  I mean, talk about a lie-fest.
[01:32:54.496 --> 01:33:00.100]  It was absolutely sickening and cynical beyond belief.
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:16.170]  He's locked down Britain, as other countries like America have been locked down, on the basis of totally fraudulent computer models by a guy called Neil Ferguson at Imperial College in London.
[01:33:16.611 --> 01:33:19.953]  And no one's going to tell me, Alex, that
[01:33:20.643 --> 01:33:40.131]  Given that his paymaster, Bill Gates, wanted lockdowns as part of this whole strategy of vaccination and destroying people's livelihoods and making them dependent on the state, there's no way that he produced the
[01:33:41.815 --> 01:33:47.399]  Catastrophic, if they were true, projections which cause lockdown.
[01:33:47.459 --> 01:33:50.922]  Half a million people will die in Britain if there's no lockdown.
[01:33:51.022 --> 01:33:52.222]  Two million in America.
[01:33:52.503 --> 01:33:56.526]  There's no way he did that by chance or by accident.
[01:33:57.406 --> 01:34:01.729]  He was producing what was necessary to make that happen.
[01:34:02.170 --> 01:34:06.733]  And what is sickening after all these weeks of lockdown and destroyed lives
[01:34:07.765 --> 01:34:19.829]  Um, is that last night and still today in the Houses of Parliament, Johnson was still saying that without the lockdown up to half a million people in Britain could have died.
[01:34:20.289 --> 01:34:21.950]  It's absolutely sickening.
[01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:26.111]  And that guy has to go because he's overseen
[01:34:27.173 --> 01:34:45.848]  The destruction of this country and goodness knows how vast numbers of people are going to recover from this because he's doing what I've been saying he would do for weeks and that is roll it back a little bit because the pressure is starting to push the other way.
[01:34:48.172 --> 01:34:50.893]  As little as he can get away with, and that's what's happening.
[01:34:50.953 --> 01:35:12.184]  And this slight easing that he's announced has the rider, which he keeps emphasizing, that if the numbers go up again, and of course they're fixing the bloody figures so they can make them go up as much as they like and down when they like, if it goes up again then he'll have to go back into the lockdown as it was before.
[01:35:12.564 --> 01:35:17.106]  So how can businesses, even as they're trying to recover from this catastrophe,
[01:35:17.791 --> 01:35:22.238]  Make any plans and commit any money, any investment.
[01:35:23.163 --> 01:35:28.527]  When they don't know if they're going to put the telly on tomorrow and see it's gone back to lockdown.
[01:35:28.587 --> 01:35:31.850]  And David, I want to go over that, but you said it three months ago.
[01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:32.810]  I said it three months ago.
[01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:35.212]  I'm not bragging, but you and I were the ones that were dead on about this.
[01:35:35.953 --> 01:35:38.074]  This is clearly the post-human takeover.
[01:35:38.154 --> 01:35:42.638]  Hollywood now admits that we want to save the earth, the whole green agenda.
[01:35:42.958 --> 01:35:49.843]  They're now admitting that this is a way to devastate the average public, get us dependent, get us on the dole, so they can dictate
[01:35:50.183 --> 01:35:50.824]  Well, the idea is to
[01:36:10.502 --> 01:36:13.304]  Roll it back, but as little as they can get away with.
[01:36:13.824 --> 01:36:25.670]  And having set the precedent of the lockdown, when the second wave comes, which, because they're fixing the figures, they can make happen when they like or appear to, then they'll go straight back into lockdown.
[01:36:26.851 --> 01:36:37.997]  And the big thing, I think you've covered it on your show as well, the big thing that they want in this next phase is control of food.
[01:36:39.020 --> 01:36:44.505]  Control of people's incomes, well they've got that for vast numbers of people, but control of food as well.
[01:36:44.865 --> 01:36:54.652]  Controlling all the necessities of life, which if you want them, will dangle you a bit, but you have to do exactly what we say.
[01:36:55.113 --> 01:37:04.100]  And this is what it's all about, and Johnson is just fronting up for the dark suits, because
[01:37:05.433 --> 01:37:09.034]  Democracy in Britain, as in other countries around the world, has been suspended.
[01:37:09.767 --> 01:37:14.251]  The Dark Suits, who've never seen a ballot box in their life, they're the ones who are driving it.
[01:37:14.611 --> 01:37:17.454]  The medical technocrats, the science technocrats.
[01:37:18.095 --> 01:37:27.723]  And they are advancing agenda in cohorts with Bill Gates, who owns most of them, financially.
[01:37:27.763 --> 01:37:29.745]  And by the way, it's so obvious now.
[01:37:29.825 --> 01:37:31.727]  Bill Gates has been destroyed online.
[01:37:32.127 --> 01:37:34.910]  Every tweet, every article that attempts to prop him up is just
[01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:36.771]  Flamed with the truth.
[01:37:37.032 --> 01:37:43.639]  So there does seem to be the inverse here, way beyond a silver lining here, that there's a humongous awakening.
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:50.306]  Well, that's why I've been, every time I've had an opportunity, I've been focusing it on Gates.
[01:37:51.047 --> 01:37:53.068]  Because Gates is the key.
[01:37:53.128 --> 01:37:56.108]  If you can discredit Gates, and my God, how easy is that?
[01:37:56.608 --> 01:37:59.829]  Then you can discredit the vaccination which Gates is pushing.
[01:38:00.269 --> 01:38:05.671]  And, you know, you mentioned I've just been deleted from Facebook and deleted from YouTube.
[01:38:06.931 --> 01:38:08.372]  And this is how it's working.
[01:38:08.432 --> 01:38:09.192]  Real simple.
[01:38:10.512 --> 01:38:12.993]  Gates controls the World Health Organization.
[01:38:13.773 --> 01:38:17.334]  Ted Ross, the Director General, is a former Gates employee.
[01:38:18.380 --> 01:38:23.663]  Tedros was on the board of Gavi, the vaccine alliance funded into existence by Gates.
[01:38:23.763 --> 01:38:25.764]  It's very much involved in all this.
[01:38:25.824 --> 01:38:45.094]  So what they do is they say, OK, the World Health Organization, created by the Rockefellers originally, of course, is the centre of knowledge and the centre of all statements and truth about this alleged virus.
[01:38:45.154 --> 01:38:45.935]  And it is alleged.
[01:38:46.627 --> 01:39:03.529]  And then what happens on the other side of the world, or on the other side of America, in Silicon Valley, is these internet giants controlled by the same people and the forces that control the World Health Organization, people like
[01:39:05.712 --> 01:39:09.475]  Susan Wojcicki at YouTube and Zuckerberg at Facebook.
[01:39:09.835 --> 01:39:23.408]  They then say we're going to censor anyone who is challenging, questioning, or exposing... And by the way, including prestigious medical doctors, major hospital heads, and what's crazy is now...
[01:39:24.881 --> 01:39:29.885]  Zuckerberg works directly under Gates and admits he takes orders from him and wears the same pink sweater.
[01:39:30.146 --> 01:39:31.607]  That's why I wore this pink sweater today.
[01:39:31.627 --> 01:39:37.232]  Did you wear your pink sweater in the last London Reel as an ode to Bill Gates, a little non-threatening pink sweater?
[01:39:38.305 --> 01:39:48.812]  Well, no, but this connection between Silicon Valley and the World Health Organization can never be more blatant.
[01:39:49.173 --> 01:40:02.362]  To actually come out, as Wachowski has at YouTube, and say we are going to censor that which challenges the World Health Organization, what it means is... The United Nations is in control of what we can say already.
[01:40:02.382 --> 01:40:03.603]  We're already under UN control.
[01:40:03.843 --> 01:40:04.823]  David Icke, stay right there.
[01:40:04.843 --> 01:40:06.685]  In fact, cue up that clip of Wachowski, folks.
[01:40:07.645 --> 01:40:19.273]  Wojcicki, whose sister heads up 23andMe, the DNA testing company that's been caught taking and using your DNA, also is on the board of GlaxoSmithKline.
[01:40:20.414 --> 01:40:24.577]  And so what started happening about 10 years ago is big tech began to merge with big pharma.
[01:40:24.897 --> 01:40:27.979]  And now they don't let you do consumer reviews, they don't let people challenge it.
[01:40:28.479 --> 01:40:31.882]  Mothers that talk about their kids getting damaged by vaccines, they're just deleted off Facebook.
[01:40:33.163 --> 01:40:36.867]  Off Twitter, off YouTube, it is a total takeover.
[01:40:37.468 --> 01:40:45.136]  And there's the article, you can see the full video there, YouTube CEO, anything that goes against the WHO is a violation of YouTube's policies.
[01:40:45.536 --> 01:40:46.317]  That is the quote.
[01:40:46.377 --> 01:40:54.746]  So literally, David Icke of DavidIcke.com and IkeConnick.com, now we're being told we wake up one day and the WHO
[01:40:56.129 --> 01:40:59.570]  San Antonio just passed a law that if you say Chinese virus, you're arrested.
[01:40:59.911 --> 01:41:04.072]  And they said, because the WHO says it's not Chinese.
[01:41:04.132 --> 01:41:08.574]  So now we've learned the WHO, run by Bill and Melinda Gates, is king of Earth.
[01:41:08.814 --> 01:41:09.234]  David Icke.
[01:41:10.815 --> 01:41:13.876]  Well, that's what it was created to do.
[01:41:13.896 --> 01:41:19.639]  Of course, the idea is to have everything globally centrally controlled.
[01:41:19.879 --> 01:41:22.900]  And so what they want under their world government
[01:41:23.762 --> 01:41:27.876]  ...is all the major subject areas of human life.
[01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:30.171]  Controlled under one roof.
[01:41:30.231 --> 01:41:32.671]  That's why we have the World Trade Organization.
[01:41:32.711 --> 01:41:35.432]  That's why we have the World Health Organization.
[01:41:35.492 --> 01:41:51.437]  What's happening now is what it was originally created to do and they've gone stepping stones what I call the totalitarian tiptoe to where it's become the the arbiter of health policy and health truth the world over.
[01:41:52.038 --> 01:41:55.899]  And if you can first of all dominate
[01:41:56.679 --> 01:42:08.386]  The narrative and then censor all challenges to that narrative, then basically all most people here are what you want them to hear and want them to believe.
[01:42:08.807 --> 01:42:19.393]  And you know, we have to not let these people like Susan Wojcicki and Zuckerberg get away with what they're doing.
[01:42:19.813 --> 01:42:25.477]  Because what they are, it's not beat about the bush, they are facilitators of fascism.
[01:42:26.346 --> 01:42:38.961]  If you look at any situation in history equivalent to medical doctors being deleted
[01:42:40.290 --> 01:42:57.157]  Because not what they're saying is wrong, but because it's not in sync with the official narrative through the World Health Organization, the only time you see that happen is in fascist and communist regimes.
[01:42:57.177 --> 01:42:58.518]  They're basically the same anyway.
[01:42:58.838 --> 01:43:00.259]  That's the only time you see it.
[01:43:00.699 --> 01:43:05.881]  So what Susan Wojcicki and Zuckerberg are doing
[01:43:06.563 --> 01:43:12.084]  is they're facilitating and advancing and making possible fascism.
[01:43:12.604 --> 01:43:14.005]  And what does that make them?
[01:43:15.405 --> 01:43:19.826]  Gates is absolutely fascistic in what he's doing.
[01:43:20.426 --> 01:43:21.506]  Who is this guy?
[01:43:22.106 --> 01:43:29.568]  He's a bloke that's come through selling software and now suddenly he's dictating global health policy.
[01:43:30.348 --> 01:43:31.448]  It's ridiculous.
[01:43:31.928 --> 01:43:32.828]  It's crazy.
[01:43:32.908 --> 01:43:34.269]  It's Alice in Wonderland.
[01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:35.489]  These people are
[01:43:36.764 --> 01:43:48.129]  Creating a fascist global state and they need to be called out on that, not, you know, beating about the bush and, you know, watching your language.
[01:43:48.349 --> 01:44:03.836]  They are fascists in what they're doing and they need to be called out on it and eventually brought to book about it because they have, in the last two months or so, together a handful of people
[01:44:04.562 --> 01:44:11.029]  Destroyed the livelihoods and the lives of vast numbers of people worldwide.
[01:44:12.011 --> 01:44:17.016]  And they all have to go to jail for crimes against humanity.
[01:44:17.917 --> 01:44:20.600]  When we get back power from this
[01:44:21.747 --> 01:44:31.451]  Fascistic network and we will eventually if people stiffen their backbone and stop sitting there hoping that something will come up.
[01:44:31.611 --> 01:44:37.654]  It's not going to come up unless you make it come up because this is not where it's meant to end.
[01:44:38.074 --> 01:44:46.398]  This is just the stepping stone towards something far more extreme if we sit here and do nothing now.
[01:44:48.846 --> 01:44:49.866]  Extremely powerful.
[01:44:50.007 --> 01:44:59.251]  And looking into Wojcicki's sister, with 23andMe, that's on record being caught taking people's DNA tests for secret operations, selling them, doing weird things.
[01:44:59.671 --> 01:45:03.092]  She got $300 million from Blacksoe SmithKline.
[01:45:03.152 --> 01:45:08.535]  And when you look into Google, Facebook, all of them, they are literally merging with Big Pharma.
[01:45:09.235 --> 01:45:21.415]  And now all these studies, all this research showing vaccine damage, even videos of the World Health Organization chief scientists last year saying vaccines are hurting people and that the cover-up needs to end, they will delete that off YouTube.
[01:45:21.435 --> 01:45:21.956]  So they've gone...
[01:45:23.095 --> 01:45:23.876]  Full fascist.
[01:45:23.896 --> 01:45:30.140]  We hear about Chinese doctors getting in trouble for talking about COVID-19 and getting arrested.
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:31.081]  That's big news here.
[01:45:31.121 --> 01:45:32.902]  But they're already doing that here.
[01:45:33.382 --> 01:45:34.843]  They're already shutting everybody down.
[01:45:34.883 --> 01:45:38.506]  There's this emergence, this leap into evil.
[01:45:38.526 --> 01:45:41.208]  You talked about it 30 years ago, Dan, when you first went public.
[01:45:41.228 --> 01:45:49.073]  You said, this will build underneath the water for a while, but when it finally explodes out, there's a point where it must emerge.
[01:45:49.113 --> 01:45:51.495]  And is this not the great emergence of the New World Order?
[01:45:52.682 --> 01:45:53.443]  Well, it is.
[01:45:53.543 --> 01:45:56.865]  It's walked into the room, but the doors clicked behind it.
[01:45:57.265 --> 01:45:58.426]  It's come out of the shadows.
[01:45:58.446 --> 01:46:09.734]  At least we can see it now, and vast numbers of people who couldn't see it before have no choice but to acknowledge the world is not like they thought it was, and the force is in control.
[01:46:10.434 --> 01:46:12.477]  Not what they thought those forces were.
[01:46:12.777 --> 01:46:31.137]  But the thing about black so Smith Klein is that has enormous fundamental connections to Bill Gates and Bill Gates, of course, has fundamental connections to all these dark suits who are pushing the the quote virus policy in all the different countries.
[01:46:31.557 --> 01:46:43.890]  We have the science advisor to Johnson, in other words, he's Buddy Handler, a guy called Valance, who was a long, long time executive of Blackstone SmithKline.
[01:46:44.351 --> 01:46:47.374]  We have the chief medical officer, a guy called Whitty,
[01:46:47.854 --> 01:46:48.555]  We're good to go.
[01:47:04.614 --> 01:47:06.055]  They're just looking on.
[01:47:06.355 --> 01:47:12.258]  Or they might make the statements, but it's the technocrats answering to the same message.
[01:47:12.278 --> 01:47:21.343]  And I totally agree with you, and I know you've got problems with Trump, so do I, but he's come out and said he thinks the numbers are overblown, he thinks it's meant to kill the economy, he's trying to get the public not to go along.
[01:47:21.683 --> 01:47:23.644]  What do you make of Trump not going along with it?
[01:47:24.505 --> 01:47:24.925]  Partially.
[01:47:25.905 --> 01:47:30.508]  I think that any politician, wherever they may be,
[01:47:31.221 --> 01:47:35.503]  Who looks upon the situation that we face.
[01:47:36.603 --> 01:47:40.705]  We'll see that we're facing an absolute catastrophe.
[01:47:41.605 --> 01:47:47.387]  You know, Johnson came to power just before Christmas with a massive majority.
[01:47:47.928 --> 01:47:50.509]  Big honeymoon period in front of him.
[01:47:51.569 --> 01:47:56.171]  And now the economy, as in America, has been devastated
[01:47:56.711 --> 01:48:01.516]  And the politicians are going to be stuck with trying to pick up the pieces as best they can.
[01:48:01.536 --> 01:48:07.642]  And when the economy goes down, it's going to be Trump and Johnson and Balasaro that get blamed by the very same medical tyranny that engineered it.
[01:48:07.962 --> 01:48:12.627]  That's why the politicians need to stop being politicians and be statesmen and expose these bastards.
[01:48:13.453 --> 01:48:17.434]  Exactly, that's the idea, that the politicians get the blame.
[01:48:18.335 --> 01:48:30.419]  But, you know, when it comes down to it, people like Johnson, and his like around the world, well, you know, don't start complaining when you get blamed for it, because in the end, you have to sign the papers.
[01:48:30.579 --> 01:48:33.540]  Officially, legally, you are the Prime Minister.
[01:48:33.900 --> 01:48:36.201]  So therefore, you could have stood up to this.
[01:48:36.661 --> 01:48:40.442]  You could have said to Ferguson, hold on a minute, half a million people
[01:48:41.102 --> 01:48:45.785]  David, I stay there because I want to ask what's coming next and how we can stop this if there's still time.
[01:48:46.826 --> 01:48:49.928]  Well, I knew that the massive draconian censorship was coming.
[01:48:51.448 --> 01:48:56.511]  And I knew they were going to launch the medical tyranny because I could read what the Rockefeller Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation were saying.
[01:48:57.112 --> 01:48:58.493]  I made a film about Bill Gates.
[01:48:58.813 --> 01:49:00.774]  He's a big part of it, Endgame, in 2007.
[01:49:03.035 --> 01:49:04.856]  And it predicts a worldwide medical tyranny.
[01:49:05.577 --> 01:49:06.518]  And I know about Bill Gates.
[01:49:06.558 --> 01:49:08.359]  His dad ran Planned Parenthood.
[01:49:08.379 --> 01:49:10.341]  His mom's on the IBM board.
[01:49:11.102 --> 01:49:14.384]  IBM was set up to carry out depopulation.
[01:49:14.945 --> 01:49:15.885]  This is all on record.
[01:49:15.905 --> 01:49:17.447]  There's Pulitzer Prize winning books on it.
[01:49:18.047 --> 01:49:21.110]  And so Gates is a front man for this larger network.
[01:49:22.174 --> 01:49:29.244]  And David Icke really scared them and hit the zeitgeist and was reaching, I don't know, extra 10 million people a week conservatively.
[01:49:29.904 --> 01:49:31.246]  They've tried to ban him now.
[01:49:31.346 --> 01:49:32.067]  It's backfiring.
[01:49:32.087 --> 01:49:33.469]  People are going to DavidIcke.com.
[01:49:33.489 --> 01:49:35.992]  They're going to I-C-K-O-N-I-C.com.
[01:49:36.153 --> 01:49:37.014]  Iconic.com.
[01:49:39.597 --> 01:49:40.618]  And that's what I love seeing.
[01:49:40.998 --> 01:49:42.159]  He's working with London Real.
[01:49:42.699 --> 01:49:43.640]  He's doing more shows.
[01:49:43.700 --> 01:49:49.685]  I noticed as they tried to oppress David and suppress David, I've never seen David look so happy and so sparkly-eyed.
[01:49:50.125 --> 01:49:54.729]  I'm the same way, because we've been proven right, and we see the fear of the globalists.
[01:49:54.749 --> 01:49:58.772]  If they were so powerful, they would just ignore us like they used to, but now...
[01:49:59.392 --> 01:50:05.174]  They can't ignore us because, as David said a few weeks ago, I am more powerful than these New World Order people.
[01:50:05.234 --> 01:50:07.315]  And you, the listeners, are more powerful.
[01:50:07.395 --> 01:50:08.255]  And they know that.
[01:50:08.595 --> 01:50:10.116]  That's why they want to make you dependent.
[01:50:10.456 --> 01:50:11.856]  That's why they want to poison you.
[01:50:12.136 --> 01:50:14.437]  That's why they want to shutter the doors of perception.
[01:50:14.477 --> 01:50:19.619]  So, David, I want to get into solutions and what's technically happening in the world in the limited time we have with you today.
[01:50:19.639 --> 01:50:20.359]  We're very appreciative.
[01:50:21.159 --> 01:50:31.964]  But speak to, you are more powerful, we are more powerful than they are, and that unconditional love, instead of being scared, opening up to the universe, and why they're so afraid of that.
[01:50:34.145 --> 01:50:40.788]  Well, you know, when you look at any situation, it can look a certain way if you look at it from a particular angle.
[01:50:41.568 --> 01:50:48.131]  And you look at what's happening with the censorship, and you can say, oh, look how powerful they are, they can censor people.
[01:50:49.170 --> 01:50:53.032]  But you look at it from another angle, and it's saying something very different.
[01:50:53.872 --> 01:50:55.113]  You know, just take me.
[01:50:55.293 --> 01:50:55.773]  I'm a guy.
[01:50:55.833 --> 01:51:00.215]  I'm living in a little flat on the Isle of Wight, just off the south coast of England.
[01:51:00.776 --> 01:51:09.620]  By the way, where they've chosen the Isle of Wight, where I live, to run the tracking trial for the, quote, virus.
[01:51:12.021 --> 01:51:14.722]  Which, of course, I'm having nothing to do with it.
[01:51:14.842 --> 01:51:18.244]  But I'm on this little island in this little flat.
[01:51:19.088 --> 01:51:22.831]  And I put out information and I put out videos.
[01:51:23.551 --> 01:51:24.292]  I write books.
[01:51:24.852 --> 01:51:46.427]  But they, powerful, so powerful, control Silicon Valley, they control governments, they control the banking system, they control the big pharma cartel, they control the whole institutions of controlling society.
[01:51:47.008 --> 01:51:47.468]  And yet,
[01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:59.449]  With all that control, they have to run around like someone shouted fire to stop someone being heard in a little flat on the Isle of Wight.
[01:52:00.009 --> 01:52:04.373]  Now that tells you where the real power is, and the real power is with the truth.
[01:52:05.006 --> 01:52:09.428]  Which has a much more powerful frequency than lies and mendacity.
[01:52:09.968 --> 01:52:18.572]  And what we're looking at here, while it may seem all we're imposing our power, actually what we're looking at is desperation for this reason.
[01:52:20.113 --> 01:52:22.154]  They have played their hand now.
[01:52:22.674 --> 01:52:26.656]  They've walked in the room, the doors click behind them, they've played their hand.
[01:52:27.236 --> 01:52:28.457]  And now they're running for home.
[01:52:29.862 --> 01:52:38.828]  And they're hoping they get to the line, complete control through AI, before enough people have woken up to stop them.
[01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:55.581]  But what they are building this on, their run for home, is a narrative about this virus that is absolutely insane.
[01:52:55.601 --> 01:52:56.722]  It's built on sand.
[01:52:57.765 --> 01:53:02.307]  Oh, it's built on absolute air.
[01:53:02.828 --> 01:53:11.352]  All you have to do is just pull a few little threads and the whole thing collapses, because the story is insane.
[01:53:11.692 --> 01:53:18.816]  They're selling a deadly virus that doesn't freaking exist, and they're only managing to make it appear exist
[01:53:19.396 --> 01:53:28.481]  And by the way, just briefly, David, when you were saying that already three months ago, I thought, OK, there's real weaponized viruses.
[01:53:28.501 --> 01:53:29.242]  They want to own it.
[01:53:29.262 --> 01:53:30.142]  They want to control it.
[01:53:30.382 --> 01:53:31.243]  But now it's coming out.
[01:53:31.283 --> 01:53:38.167]  They admit they authorize totally fake tests that say everybody is infected.
[01:53:38.707 --> 01:53:43.369]  And I'm sure you know Tanzania sent it off and said papayas and goats came up positive.
[01:53:43.570 --> 01:53:44.450]  It's totally fake.
[01:53:45.471 --> 01:53:47.792]  Yeah, they they they sent off
[01:53:48.451 --> 01:53:50.072]  A sample from pawpaw!
[01:53:50.693 --> 01:53:54.216]  And it came back positive for COVID-19.
[01:53:54.716 --> 01:53:55.637]  It's insane.
[01:53:56.037 --> 01:54:04.223]  So all this testing is merely to try to make it look as if it's everywhere, when actually it's nowhere.
[01:54:04.664 --> 01:54:10.388]  So when you look at that Alex, the whole foundation is air and wind,
[01:54:12.933 --> 01:54:18.599]  How can they defend that without censoring people exposing that?
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:19.800]  They have to.
[01:54:20.221 --> 01:54:23.364]  It's not that oil will impose our power.
[01:54:23.645 --> 01:54:24.305]  Here's another one.
[01:54:24.405 --> 01:54:25.767]  All these meatpacking plants.
[01:54:25.787 --> 01:54:26.948]  No one's gotten sick.
[01:54:26.988 --> 01:54:27.929]  They test thousands.
[01:54:28.249 --> 01:54:28.950]  Hundreds have it.
[01:54:29.190 --> 01:54:30.352]  Everyone's asymptomatic.
[01:54:30.392 --> 01:54:31.112]  Nobody's sick.
[01:54:32.025 --> 01:54:33.546]  Well, a couple of things, Alex, right?
[01:54:34.087 --> 01:54:37.509]  First of all, they have no symptoms because there is no virus.
[01:54:37.749 --> 01:54:44.134]  And here's another thing, which might lead us into another area, because they're using this to kill vast numbers of old people in this country.
[01:54:44.174 --> 01:54:45.856]  It's absolutely unbelievable.
[01:54:46.476 --> 01:54:54.102]  But why do old people die from this virus and young people don't?
[01:54:54.643 --> 01:54:55.443]  Oh, well, it's this.
[01:54:55.463 --> 01:54:55.984]  No, no.
[01:54:56.004 --> 01:54:57.445]  I'll tell you why it is.
[01:54:58.180 --> 01:55:07.315]  Because young people overwhelmingly do not have other conditions that threaten their life.
[01:55:07.655 --> 01:55:08.376]  Which really kills them.
[01:55:09.898 --> 01:55:10.978]  They don't have them.
[01:55:11.338 --> 01:55:22.580]  So because young people don't have other morbidities, those other reasons why they die don't exist overwhelmingly to be labeled COVID-19 deaths.
[01:55:23.060 --> 01:55:31.702]  But older people, and the older you get, the more of these other conditions and morbidities you have that are going to end your life.
[01:55:32.102 --> 01:55:34.903]  So they have endless potential with old people to
[01:55:36.963 --> 01:55:38.263]  Say it's a COVID-19 death.
[01:55:38.323 --> 01:55:47.065]  And by the way, now the president agrees with you and that's been proven right, but those of us that know this must get this out to everyone else that doesn't know, or this fraud is going to succeed.
[01:55:49.665 --> 01:55:59.647]  But the other thing is, I hear them saying, well, it seems as if people aren't getting immunity, even people that have had it, they're not getting immunity.
[01:55:59.867 --> 01:56:01.348]  Well, why aren't they getting immunity?
[01:56:01.368 --> 01:56:03.268]  Because they never had anything to get immunity of.
[01:56:05.886 --> 01:56:10.780]  That's why it doesn't act like any virus that ever acted before, because you're right, it's just completely made up!
[01:56:11.795 --> 01:56:15.478]  They're testing people for a genetic material, not a virus.
[01:56:15.658 --> 01:56:16.498]  Provable fact.
[01:56:16.938 --> 01:56:19.080]  And then they're testing positive.
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:21.582]  Oh, isolate for 14 days.
[01:56:21.982 --> 01:56:26.645]  Then they test them again for the genetic material that's in their body, not the virus.
[01:56:27.105 --> 01:56:28.906]  Oh, they've tested positive again.
[01:56:28.967 --> 01:56:29.907]  There's no immunity.
[01:56:30.127 --> 01:56:32.449]  But of course they've tested positive twice.
[01:56:32.869 --> 01:56:37.152]  They've tested positive for the same genetic material they had then and they've still got.
[01:56:37.552 --> 01:56:38.393]  It's crazy.
[01:56:38.473 --> 01:56:39.794]  And so would a papaya.
[01:56:40.134 --> 01:56:41.495]  And so would a turtle out of the yard.
[01:56:42.855 --> 01:56:43.616]  That's crazy!
[01:56:44.156 --> 01:56:58.641]  But this is why they have to censor on the extraordinary scale that they are, because their narrative is so shot full of holes.
[01:56:58.721 --> 01:57:00.501]  Why would they go with such a shoddy narrative?
[01:57:00.521 --> 01:57:02.402]  Because you've been proven right, it is a giant hoax.
[01:57:02.822 --> 01:57:04.543]  Why would they go with something so ridiculous?
[01:57:04.583 --> 01:57:06.083]  I guess because you can't ever prove it?
[01:57:06.343 --> 01:57:08.144]  So it just becomes a war of propaganda?
[01:57:09.229 --> 01:57:13.474]  Well, I mentioned this the last time we spoke.
[01:57:14.174 --> 01:57:22.543]  If you release, and I'm not saying these bioweapons don't exist, my God they exist, but if you release one of them you lose control of it.
[01:57:23.024 --> 01:57:26.868]  If you have a fake virus which you're actually manipulating,
[01:57:27.914 --> 01:57:28.434]  I don't
[01:57:48.391 --> 01:57:50.792]  A virus that doesn't exist, you're making it appear to exist.
[01:57:51.093 --> 01:57:51.973]  So you have control.
[01:57:52.193 --> 01:57:56.976]  You can make the numbers go up, you can make it flatline, or second wave, you can make it go again.
[01:57:57.676 --> 01:57:58.857]  So you have control of it.
[01:57:59.578 --> 01:58:05.121]  But in doing that, it means you're very, very vulnerable to the fact that you're lying.
[01:58:06.522 --> 01:58:10.364]  And, you know, when you've got... All right, final segment, David Icke.
[01:58:10.384 --> 01:58:11.344]  You're on fire as usual.
[01:58:11.364 --> 01:58:14.026]  We'll come back and talk about solutions when we come back with David Icke.
[01:58:15.219 --> 01:58:18.181]  Final segment with David Icke, who needs no introduction.
[01:58:18.221 --> 01:58:19.421]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:58:19.901 --> 01:58:22.463]  Please remember, we knew the censorship was coming.
[01:58:22.963 --> 01:58:24.404]  We built this infrastructure.
[01:58:25.004 --> 01:58:32.888]  We built the satellite uplinks, the giant streaming systems, all of it, knowing mass censorship was coming and we needed to have our own system.
[01:58:33.288 --> 01:58:35.629]  Google's worth $700 billion.
[01:58:35.769 --> 01:58:36.770]  Apple's worth a trillion.
[01:58:37.190 --> 01:58:38.692]  And they've got all their big fancy systems.
[01:58:38.712 --> 01:58:43.978]  We've done this with millions of dollars, and it costs millions and millions and millions of bandwidth to do what we're doing.
[01:58:44.398 --> 01:58:49.684]  In fact, I had the crew come in last week and they said, even though we got better deals on bandwidth, they said, look at what this is costing.
[01:58:50.906 --> 01:58:55.251]  Just some David Icke interviews we mirrored have like 5 million views on Band.Video.
[01:58:56.246 --> 01:59:00.069]  The doctor's press conference that got censored, that's got almost 2 million views.
[01:59:00.569 --> 01:59:03.731]  All these other things that have been taken down now have a place to go.
[01:59:04.252 --> 01:59:07.274]  Now it's making me a major target, and I'm not going to get into that yet.
[01:59:07.354 --> 01:59:09.475]  I may have to, though, but they're coming after me, folks.
[01:59:09.835 --> 01:59:16.760]  You saw they put this woman in jail that worked for Fauci, this virologist that's been exposing him for putting cancer viruses in vaccines.
[01:59:17.501 --> 01:59:22.945]  This is a very dangerous place to be, but we're all in danger, and so getting on our knees is not the way to go.
[01:59:23.025 --> 01:59:24.165]  So, info or storm.
[01:59:26.086 --> 01:59:28.807]  We've got the biggest sales that we've run since last Christmas.
[01:59:29.447 --> 01:59:31.327]  We won't have a sale this big until Christmas again.
[01:59:32.007 --> 01:59:35.188]  All current high-quality products are 30 to 60% off.
[01:59:35.648 --> 01:59:42.069]  Stuff like 8-pack Power Stack, 13 different vitamins and minerals every day, two different packs, A and B. That is so close to cost.
[01:59:42.130 --> 01:59:42.710]  It's incredible.
[01:59:44.070 --> 01:59:46.390]  We have the Triionine back in stock, 60% off.
[01:59:46.950 --> 01:59:48.451]  X2 back in stock, 50% off.
[01:59:48.591 --> 01:59:49.891]  Vazo beats 40% off.
[01:59:50.191 --> 01:59:51.571]  These are really all high-quality products.
[01:59:51.591 --> 01:59:53.972]  We have the new 5G Kills t-shirts.
[01:59:55.540 --> 01:59:57.841]  Where they're trying to censor you if you expose 5G everywhere?
[01:59:58.421 --> 02:00:00.521]  Well, simply wear the shirt.
[02:00:00.621 --> 02:00:02.222]  And it's got InfoWars.com on the back.
[02:00:02.522 --> 02:00:06.963]  And don't forget, you can also go to DavidIke.com and find all of his censored books and information as well.
[02:00:07.343 --> 02:00:12.084]  Okay, in the nine minutes we have left, David, you wanted to get into the evil of Bill Gates.
[02:00:12.184 --> 02:00:13.905]  We're going to play a few clips of him.
[02:00:13.925 --> 02:00:17.345]  And you wanted to get into their targeting old people, which Bill Gates admits they're doing.
[02:00:17.365 --> 02:00:19.826]  But here's Bill Gates last week on CNN.
[02:00:20.226 --> 02:00:21.406]  Radio listeners can't see it.
[02:00:21.666 --> 02:00:23.567]  Fareed Zarkaria, the Bilderberg Group member,
[02:00:24.485 --> 02:00:25.905]  He says, oh, things are coming back to normal.
[02:00:25.925 --> 02:00:27.486]  This is going to be horrible and long.
[02:00:27.826 --> 02:00:33.347]  And Bill Gates looks like he has this murderous, psychotic smile on his face.
[02:00:34.147 --> 02:00:34.607]  Here it is.
[02:00:35.227 --> 02:00:37.888]  The economy is not going to be anything like it was.
[02:00:37.908 --> 02:00:39.948]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[02:00:40.028 --> 02:00:44.549]  It's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful this is.
[02:00:44.709 --> 02:00:47.410]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:53.211]  It's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful this is.
[02:00:53.991 --> 02:00:59.452]  That's a trade-off society is making because of very, very high medical costs.
[02:00:59.933 --> 02:01:13.796]  And a lack of willingness to say, you know, is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade-off in medical costs?
[02:01:13.816 --> 02:01:17.977]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[02:01:18.837 --> 02:01:20.778]  Teaching people that if we kill old people,
[02:01:22.632 --> 02:01:24.432]  Well, I've been writing my books for, well, decades now.
[02:01:47.347 --> 02:01:58.669]  That this network is not human as we perceive human, and what I say they are, and I explain why in the books, is biological AI.
[02:01:59.489 --> 02:02:12.431]  See, where they're pushing the human race, you know, all this synthetic biology and all that, the human form, the human body, is being pushed in the same direction of where they already are.
[02:02:13.351 --> 02:02:16.352]  So when you look at these psychopaths,
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:36.668]  You look at Zuckerberg and look at Tony Blair even, even though he's way down the pecking order he is, and you see their mouth smile in terms of Gates, bloody rarely, but their eyes don't smile with their mouth.
[02:02:37.449 --> 02:02:45.352]  And when your eyes and your mouth are not speaking the same language, then you're dealing with some level of fraud.
[02:02:46.002 --> 02:02:49.486]  And in terms of Gates it's absolutely fantastic.
[02:02:50.007 --> 02:02:58.076]  Now if you think of this biological AI concept, what do these people not have?
[02:02:58.826 --> 02:03:02.230]  They don't have any, what we would call, humanity.
[02:03:02.310 --> 02:03:03.832]  They have no empathy.
[02:03:04.132 --> 02:03:05.494]  They have no compassion.
[02:03:05.854 --> 02:03:07.016]  What am I describing?
[02:03:07.316 --> 02:03:09.679]  I'm describing basically a computer program.
[02:03:10.100 --> 02:03:17.709]  You know, when you put a computer program into a computer that has the effect of doing horrendous things,
[02:03:18.450 --> 02:03:25.233]  The computer doesn't have any emotional filter or consequence, it just does it.
[02:03:25.253 --> 02:03:26.894]  It's like press enter does it.
[02:03:27.314 --> 02:03:28.714]  And that's what these people are like.
[02:03:28.934 --> 02:03:32.556]  This is why they have no compassion, they have no empathy.
[02:03:32.916 --> 02:03:44.621]  So you've got Gates, this man with the dead eyes, there's no life, there's no soul there, is quite happy, in fact he'll be getting off on it,
[02:03:45.433 --> 02:03:53.839]  To see literally billions of people in terrible straits just so he can get a vaccine inside them for the next stage.
[02:03:54.099 --> 02:03:57.862]  And he admits, oh, 700,000 will get sick, which we know is a way under us.
[02:03:57.882 --> 02:03:59.763]  But I agree with you, but there's a subtlety here.
[02:04:00.163 --> 02:04:01.664]  They don't have emotion about hurting us.
[02:04:01.725 --> 02:04:03.126]  In fact, they actually do have emotion.
[02:04:03.426 --> 02:04:04.987]  They enjoy hurting people.
[02:04:05.987 --> 02:04:10.189]  Yeah, that's what they're programmed to do, that's what psychopaths do.
[02:04:10.769 --> 02:04:25.136]  You look at the hair test of psychopathic traits, named after the guy who came up with it, and you tick off all the psychopathic traits, no empathies right at the top, and you are looking at the character traits of these people.
[02:04:25.822 --> 02:04:38.193]  You know, I mean, someone like Wojcicki and Zuckerberg, what level of psychopathy and lack of empathy do you need to have to just delete
[02:04:38.985 --> 02:04:42.687]  Vast numbers of people's right to a free opinion.
[02:04:43.107 --> 02:04:55.774]  Just to wipe away medical doctors from your platform for this only reason that they are saying the wrong things by the agenda that you are... That, by the way, has been proven true in the limited time we have left.
[02:04:55.894 --> 02:05:01.037]  Get into killing old people, recapping that, because they admit that's really the agenda.
[02:05:01.758 --> 02:05:08.222]  This is really important, and that clip was very appropriate there of Bill Gates talking about this.
[02:05:09.343 --> 02:05:24.012]  I have quoted a man in my books over the years whose name was Dr Richard Day, and he was an executive of Planned Parenthood, the same as Gates' father was involved in, as you mentioned earlier.
[02:05:24.850 --> 02:05:33.297]  And Richard Day stood up in front of a meeting of pediatricians in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1969.
[02:05:34.318 --> 02:05:36.900]  And no one knows why he did this, but I'm glad he did.
[02:05:37.861 --> 02:05:46.589]  He asked them to turn off recording equipment and not take notes, because he was going to tell them how the world was going to change, because basically what he represented as a gopher was going to change it.
[02:05:47.145 --> 02:05:53.729]  And what he said that night, and in a book I wrote called Phantom Self, I detail at length what he said.
[02:05:54.169 --> 02:05:57.251]  It's unbelievable when you look at current events.
[02:05:58.312 --> 02:06:05.436]  And he talked, he described the internet in 1969, that's supposed to have been invented in the, what, 1980s.
[02:06:06.556 --> 02:06:11.319]  And he said a stream of things in detail that have actually happened.
[02:06:11.959 --> 02:06:16.302]  And one of the things he talked about was what he called the demise pill.
[02:06:17.153 --> 02:06:25.500]  Where the plan was, eventually, that you'll only be allowed to live a certain amount of time, and when you reach that point, you take a demise pill.
[02:06:26.141 --> 02:06:28.102]  He even described it.
[02:06:28.142 --> 02:06:29.664]  This is the level of psychopathy.
[02:06:30.865 --> 02:06:45.357]  Oh, you know, what would happen is mum and dad, they'd have a party with their kids, and oh, mum and dad have done very well, what a good life, and then at the end of the party, they'd take the demise pill, when you reach a certain age.
[02:06:45.857 --> 02:06:53.259]  So, they've had this targeting of old people for a long time and this fake virus has given them the chance to do it.
[02:06:53.719 --> 02:07:02.942]  So, we at DavidEye.com have been approached by nurses who work in care homes who are saying that basically it's murder.
[02:07:03.022 --> 02:07:04.242]  That's the word they use.
[02:07:04.602 --> 02:07:06.302]  And that's why they suddenly have higher numbers.
[02:07:06.362 --> 02:07:08.163]  They kick the families out and they kill them.
[02:07:09.068 --> 02:07:10.568]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:07:10.628 --> 02:07:26.712]  What they're doing, according to these nurses, is they're designating people with COVID-19, old people in nursing homes and care homes, with no test, even though the test is nonsense, they don't even go through that, you know, facade, just say they've got it.
[02:07:26.852 --> 02:07:33.473]  And if one has it, or is said to have had it, then by definition they take it that they've all got it.
[02:07:34.033 --> 02:07:36.574]  And when that happens, doctors stop coming in.
[02:07:37.865 --> 02:07:45.232]  And, you know, this one nurse was saying, we're begging for antibiotics for our old people, but we can't get them.
[02:07:45.673 --> 02:07:46.674]  And then they die.
[02:07:46.794 --> 02:07:49.777]  And when they die, they designate them COVID-19.
[02:07:49.837 --> 02:07:55.323]  But one of the other things that's happening, and this is now even hit the mainstream media in this country.
[02:07:55.623 --> 02:07:56.344]  Hallelujah.
[02:07:57.037 --> 02:08:12.367]  Is the pressure on old people from doctors, their family doctors, and from hospital doctors and medical staff, for old people to sign do not resuscitate forms.
[02:08:13.167 --> 02:08:16.690]  So when they need to be, you know,
[02:08:17.836 --> 02:08:18.196]  That's right.
[02:08:18.276 --> 02:08:19.056]  Be a hero.
[02:08:19.276 --> 02:08:21.757]  Die so there's room in the hospitals that are actually empty.
[02:08:21.837 --> 02:08:22.937]  I know you said you could only an hour.
[02:08:22.957 --> 02:08:23.417]  You gotta go.
[02:08:23.698 --> 02:08:24.318]  Two minute break.
[02:08:24.398 --> 02:08:24.698]  Finish.
[02:08:25.078 --> 02:08:26.158]  Finish this point on the other side.
[02:08:26.178 --> 02:08:27.378]  You'll be gone at five after.
[02:08:27.779 --> 02:08:28.499]  David Icke's our guest.
[02:08:28.559 --> 02:08:35.040]  We have a very special report that we've not aired yet that will air at six after that we put a lot of work into.
[02:08:35.080 --> 02:08:35.961]  It's very important.
[02:08:36.461 --> 02:08:37.241]  That's coming up.
[02:08:37.381 --> 02:08:38.961]  And then I'm going to San Antonio.
[02:08:39.322 --> 02:08:40.662]  I haven't told you about this yet.
[02:08:40.722 --> 02:08:41.862]  I'm gonna get to it, I promise.
[02:08:42.302 --> 02:08:42.762]  Stay with us.
[02:08:42.802 --> 02:08:44.663]  Back in two minutes with David Icke of DavidIcke.com.
[02:08:45.569 --> 02:08:47.470]  All right, folks, last five minutes with David Icke.
[02:08:47.490 --> 02:08:49.770]  We have a special report coming up, and then Gerald Cilente.
[02:08:50.490 --> 02:08:51.431]  Let's go right to him.
[02:08:52.191 --> 02:08:55.252]  David, finish up your point about targeting the old, dehumanizing them.
[02:08:55.512 --> 02:08:56.332]  It's in the news today.
[02:08:56.532 --> 02:09:04.034]  Oh, I'm not resuscitating to make more room for the COVID, even though we're not going to help people that have heart attacks in the U.S.
[02:09:05.174 --> 02:09:05.874]  and the U.K.
[02:09:06.454 --> 02:09:07.135]  It's global.
[02:09:07.595 --> 02:09:09.135]  Who standardizes all of this?
[02:09:09.155 --> 02:09:12.476]  And then you were getting into the groups and organizations that are banning you right now.
[02:09:13.464 --> 02:09:16.732]  Yeah, well, it's centrally dictated.
[02:09:16.752 --> 02:09:19.739]  I mean, you know, it's like a transnational corporation.
[02:09:19.779 --> 02:09:23.567]  You know, you have a headquarters in the shadows in this case.
[02:09:24.258 --> 02:09:35.266]  And then you have the different subsidiary networks in each country that impose the will of the central, if you like, headquarters of this cult in their particular area.
[02:09:35.286 --> 02:09:38.989]  That's why the same things are happening in all the different countries.
[02:09:39.069 --> 02:09:42.651]  And the old people are absolutely being targeted.
[02:09:42.811 --> 02:09:45.133]  And, you know, when you look
[02:09:46.031 --> 02:09:57.513]  At the goals of the climate hoax, the human-caused climate hoax, and you look at the goals and the happenings of this virus scam, they are the same.
[02:09:58.114 --> 02:10:03.795]  And one of the things, of course, that the climate cult has been doing is demonizing old people.
[02:10:04.195 --> 02:10:07.055]  It's those old people, they've destroyed our world.
[02:10:07.095 --> 02:10:09.196]  This is what Greta Thunberg's always talking about.
[02:10:09.476 --> 02:10:13.297]  The old people, they're the ones that, you know, they're the ones that destroyed our world.
[02:10:13.357 --> 02:10:14.137]  How dare you?
[02:10:15.458 --> 02:10:22.643]  And all the pressure, all the propaganda is to demonize old people.
[02:10:22.743 --> 02:10:24.784]  And you know, what do we need old people for?
[02:10:25.045 --> 02:10:26.406]  You know, they're no use anymore.
[02:10:26.446 --> 02:10:28.967]  This is the whole propaganda narrative.
[02:10:29.188 --> 02:10:31.649]  And now they've got their opportunity.
[02:10:32.790 --> 02:10:38.014]  And I say this to any younger people that think old people don't matter.
[02:10:38.786 --> 02:10:44.008]  Um, they had decades and decades and decades and decades and decades of experience.
[02:10:44.589 --> 02:10:54.833]  They've been there, done it, got the t-shirt and the jacket, and maybe there's something you might be able to learn from them instead of demonizing them.
[02:10:55.794 --> 02:10:56.614]  Because, um,
[02:10:57.541 --> 02:11:12.164]  If you listen to the older people, you might not be scammed in the way you are being scammed currently to push for the very happenings, the very policy changes, the very society that is going to take your people.
[02:11:12.184 --> 02:11:22.627]  That's another reason they want to get rid of the old people is they didn't grow up under this and they want to be able just to erase the past and now with all the AI censorship, they can actually go in and digitally erase the past.
[02:11:23.717 --> 02:11:32.861]  Yeah, they don't want young people and old people interacting because of the experience that older people have.
[02:11:33.662 --> 02:11:37.683]  Older people knew the world before it became what it is.
[02:11:38.144 --> 02:11:41.805]  Younger people now being born into it, this is all they've ever known.
[02:11:41.865 --> 02:11:42.906]  This is their real.
[02:11:42.946 --> 02:11:43.986]  This is their normal.
[02:11:44.266 --> 02:11:45.967]  Whereas to older people, it's not.
[02:11:46.067 --> 02:11:47.448]  We have the radar to see.
[02:11:50.369 --> 02:11:57.295]  What a phenomenal transformation has taken place and what freedom there was before and isn't now.
[02:11:58.096 --> 02:12:02.720]  People need to listen to old people and they might learn something.
[02:12:03.000 --> 02:12:03.340]  That's right.
[02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:05.662]  Old people need to get very vocal and very active.
[02:12:05.682 --> 02:12:09.045]  If all of us just start speaking out...
[02:12:10.714 --> 02:12:14.917]  There's this phrase, there's no fool like an old fool, and that is true.
[02:12:14.937 --> 02:12:19.281]  You know, if you've lived 70, 80 years and learned nothing, that's true.
[02:12:19.741 --> 02:12:36.895]  But there's vast numbers of people of that age who have learned something and have experience that needs to be listened to and not just waved away with an arrogant wave of the hand, which is what's happening to so many old people now.
[02:12:37.195 --> 02:12:39.657]  And my grandparents were all so incredibly smart.
[02:12:40.417 --> 02:12:41.878]  Life matters.
[02:12:42.539 --> 02:12:47.363]  All life matters, no matter what its color is and no matter what its age is.
[02:12:47.803 --> 02:12:57.470]  That's something that maybe we could learn and realize we're all part of one family, no matter what our age, no matter what our color, no matter what our background.
[02:12:57.891 --> 02:13:07.058]  And if we did that, then we could come together in unity instead of being divided and ruled so the few can control the many, because the many are at war with each other.
[02:13:07.944 --> 02:13:09.085]  Everyone, take action.
[02:13:09.305 --> 02:13:12.686]  Infowars.com, DavidIke.com, Iconic.com.
[02:13:13.186 --> 02:13:16.728]  You're the only way this gets out, and you're doing a great job getting it out, so we salute you and thank you.
[02:13:17.008 --> 02:13:17.888]  David, thanks for the time.
[02:13:17.909 --> 02:13:18.649]  We really appreciate it.
[02:13:18.669 --> 02:13:19.629]  Look forward to talking to you soon.
[02:13:20.550 --> 02:13:20.910]  See you, mate.
[02:13:20.950 --> 02:13:21.150]  Bye.
[02:13:21.510 --> 02:13:22.190]  There goes David Ike.
[02:13:22.270 --> 02:13:23.331]  Okay, great job to the crew.
[02:13:23.511 --> 02:13:24.912]  I have this special report coming up.
[02:13:25.392 --> 02:13:30.174]  And yes, we've got airplanes flying over San Antonio that say, SayChineseVirus.com.
[02:13:30.854 --> 02:13:32.235]  SayChineseVirus.com.
[02:13:32.275 --> 02:13:33.575]  It takes you to Infowars.com.
[02:13:33.816 --> 02:13:35.696]  I'm about to drive down to San Antonio to say it.
[02:13:35.957 --> 02:13:36.597]  They may arrest me.
[02:13:38.237 --> 02:13:42.118]  There's a new Twilight Zone episode that's premiering here in about 20 seconds.
[02:13:43.553 --> 02:13:44.974]  New Twilight Zone Episode 666.
[02:13:45.234 --> 02:13:47.234]  It's on Bandot.
[02:13:47.254 --> 02:13:48.255]  Video just went live.
[02:13:48.335 --> 02:13:48.935]  Please share it.
[02:13:49.455 --> 02:13:51.356]  But I'm about to get in the car and drive down to San Antonio.
[02:13:51.376 --> 02:13:52.676]  I'll be at the Alamo in about an hour and a half.
[02:13:53.017 --> 02:13:55.578]  They say they'll arrest you if you say the words, Chinese virus.
[02:13:55.898 --> 02:14:01.980]  So we have airplanes above San Antonio right now with the words, SayChineseVirus.com.
[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:03.921]  SayChineseVirus.com.
[02:14:04.361 --> 02:14:06.162]  Exercise the First Amendment or lose it.
[02:14:06.382 --> 02:14:07.982]  I'll see you in San Antonio in about an hour and a half.
[02:14:08.302 --> 02:14:09.643]  Here is the new special report.
[02:14:24.042 --> 02:14:33.484]  You live on a planet where the governments of the world are openly telling you that you are non-essential, obsolete.
[02:14:34.684 --> 02:14:49.006]  Imagine living on that planet in the year 2020 that major world leaders in places like Israel and Sweden are proposing everyone be implanted with a microchip and be tracked by the state.
[02:14:50.687 --> 02:14:53.107]  Imagine living in a world
[02:14:54.394 --> 02:15:01.919]  Where the third world population is already starving to death and where the general public has been locked in their homes for at least two months.
[02:15:03.280 --> 02:15:16.188]  And the people are being told that now robot drones and robot dogs are going to be enforcers and make sure they follow the new rules and that things are never going back to the way they were.
[02:15:17.449 --> 02:15:24.878]  Imagine that at first you were told it's only two weeks to cut the curve of two million projected dead in America.
[02:15:25.618 --> 02:15:29.343]  And then it turns out that was all completely exaggerated at least 30 times.
[02:15:31.305 --> 02:15:37.672]  And then imagine that it turns out it's not a Twilight Zone episode, but it's the real world in 2020.
[02:15:39.591 --> 02:15:47.883]  The man leading the initiative for the United Nations, Bill Gates, is openly obsessed with population reduction.
[02:15:49.614 --> 02:15:54.136]  And he's openly said that vaccines will contribute to depopulating the world.
[02:15:54.196 --> 02:15:57.157]  We see a lot of things that are going very well.
[02:15:57.737 --> 02:15:59.538]  Things like reducing childhood death.
[02:16:00.278 --> 02:16:02.579]  Things like reducing childhood death.
[02:16:02.839 --> 02:16:09.902]  And he even admits in 2020 that there are going to be 700,000 people that get sick or who die from the vaccine.
[02:16:10.002 --> 02:16:11.742]  We have 1 in 10,000 side effects.
[02:16:11.783 --> 02:16:13.283]  That's way more, 700,000.
[02:16:18.785 --> 02:16:20.966]  Uh, you know, people who will suffer from that.
[02:16:21.046 --> 02:16:24.667]  But nevertheless, life won't ever return to normal.
[02:16:25.027 --> 02:16:29.748]  But if you want to be able to go outside, you're gonna be forced to take this shot.
[02:16:30.748 --> 02:16:33.809]  And then, of course, now they're announcing it's gonna be hundreds of shots.
[02:16:34.049 --> 02:16:38.030]  And it's worse than just the chip now being openly pushed.
[02:16:39.440 --> 02:16:49.087]  No, now they're saying they have a special vaccine for you called a DNA vaccine that goes into the nucleus of your cell and reprograms it.
[02:16:49.907 --> 02:16:54.651]  And in the rat studies and other studies, it causes all sorts of mutations and cancer.
[02:16:56.772 --> 02:16:57.993]  But you don't have to imagine it.
[02:16:58.854 --> 02:16:59.994]  It's the real world in 2020.
[02:17:00.135 --> 02:17:02.936]  And it's what you and I and all of us face.
[02:17:04.187 --> 02:17:17.857]  A nightmare dystopia that's been prepared and tested on third world populations and on the victims of the communist Chinese regime that's now leaving beta and going into full operations.
[02:17:18.717 --> 02:17:23.340]  You see, the chip is meant to track you and control you and keep you locked down.
[02:17:25.022 --> 02:17:25.902]  That's just the beginning.
[02:17:27.123 --> 02:17:30.746]  The scientific dictatorship wants the precedent to be able to put in your body
[02:17:31.778 --> 02:17:38.761]  Whatever they want, whenever they want, and have you not be able to challenge it and speak out against it.
[02:17:39.321 --> 02:17:46.944]  And in Bill Gates' own words, they want liability protection for these new so-called vaccines being introduced in the body.
[02:17:48.271 --> 02:18:03.619]  For more than 20 years, they've developed and tested vaccines that actually go into parts of the brain and carry out a high-tech lobotomy to eat certain nerve-ending receptor sites associated with spiritual experiences and high brain waves.
[02:18:04.379 --> 02:18:14.725]  Those are the same receptor sites that your body naturally produces endorphins when you do a good job or win that promotion at work or end up finding the woman or man of your dreams.
[02:18:16.428 --> 02:18:23.609]  These are literally behavioral vaccines that reprogram the way our brains work by destroying parts of our mind.
[02:18:24.049 --> 02:18:27.890]  And they're being pushed as anti-stress and anti-drug addiction vaccines.
[02:18:28.510 --> 02:18:34.471]  Yes, you won't want alcohol or heroin or nicotine ever again because those receptor sites would have been destroyed.
[02:18:35.011 --> 02:18:37.192]  But those receptor sites were there for a reason.
[02:18:37.612 --> 02:18:44.213]  They were picking up natural chemicals and endorphins that your body produces when it sees you doing the right thing.
[02:18:45.765 --> 02:19:10.911]  But you see, the globalists know that when we have a conscience, and we feel good, and the universe that God created, that programmed us, rewards us with those spiritual experiences that we don't want the New World Order, we don't want their false system, we don't want their materialistic control grid, and so that's why they want to literally burn that out of our brains, so we will become psychotic automatons like they are.
[02:19:11.531 --> 02:19:17.398]  Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, is proposing microchips for all the children in Israel.
[02:19:17.919 --> 02:19:24.086]  Because after all, all your cars in Israel are already tracked by the Israeli intelligence agencies for your safety.
[02:19:24.306 --> 02:19:27.650]  So why shouldn't the people all be tracked as well?
[02:19:28.351 --> 02:19:28.571]  I think?
[02:19:44.915 --> 02:19:51.859]  At a common sense level, that this is beyond a science fiction nightmare novel and must absolutely be opposed.
[02:19:52.399 --> 02:19:54.941]  It's not that we have something to hide or that we've done something wrong.
[02:19:55.401 --> 02:20:07.528]  We know that powerful corporations and governments from the beginning of the internet age have been spying on the public, have been manipulating the public, and have been twisting information and choices so the public is not informed.
[02:20:08.268 --> 02:20:29.908]  We see massive censorship taking place, not just of InfoWars now, but of major journalists and doctors and famous virologists that are coming out and pointing out that COVID-19 is not even that deadly and that all the regular deaths from flus and the cold and heart attacks and cancers are being put in the COVID-19 column.
[02:20:30.629 --> 02:20:30.829]  Even
[02:20:32.136 --> 02:20:34.837]  Fauci's own team admits that that's the case.
[02:20:35.457 --> 02:20:37.597]  But if you point it out, you get banned.
[02:20:38.118 --> 02:20:45.219]  So we're not just seeing the rollout of implantable microchips and forced high-tech deadly inoculations that reprogram our bodies.
[02:20:45.539 --> 02:20:46.460]  That's what cancer does.
[02:20:47.320 --> 02:20:54.922]  We're now seeing a total control grid of AI going in and even censoring what people can send on their own private text messages.
[02:20:56.175 --> 02:20:58.797]  The globalists know that their whole program has been exposed.
[02:20:59.197 --> 02:21:00.398]  They know that they're in trouble.
[02:21:00.638 --> 02:21:18.428]  They know the UN's own World Health Organization group last December met for a two-day conference and admitted that vaccines are hurting people and they're not being properly tested and that there's a cover-up and that the doctors who are the front line have become quote wobbly and don't believe in them.
[02:21:19.149 --> 02:21:21.050]  So instead of backing off and admitting
[02:21:22.128 --> 02:21:22.288]  I think?
[02:21:39.315 --> 02:21:43.837]  You don't live until you accept in your body whatever we want to put in it.
[02:21:44.138 --> 02:21:49.701]  Oh, and by the way, there's liability protection for those companies so they can hurt you and get away with it.
[02:21:49.961 --> 02:21:55.664]  And then if you try to complain about it online, we will ban your internet identity and not even let you communicate with other humans.
[02:21:56.324 --> 02:21:57.025]  So just like that.
[02:21:57.645 --> 02:21:59.186]  We're inside the New World Order, just like that.
[02:21:59.506 --> 02:22:01.247]  We're inside Revelations, just like that.
[02:22:01.287 --> 02:22:02.328]  We're inside the dystopia.
[02:22:02.748 --> 02:22:06.210]  And they are testing and tracking and seeing how much we will put up with.
[02:22:06.451 --> 02:22:10.593]  That's why they sycophantically sit up there on the news and say, you're a hero when you wear the mask.
[02:22:10.933 --> 02:22:12.394]  You're a hero when you don't go out.
[02:22:12.835 --> 02:22:14.816]  You're a hero in this new paradigm.
[02:22:15.176 --> 02:22:16.017]  And you're the leaders.
[02:22:16.057 --> 02:22:17.517]  You've done such a good job.
[02:22:17.558 --> 02:22:21.920]  And Hollywood says it's permanent now to save the Earth, to lower our carbon footprint.
[02:22:21.960 --> 02:22:23.541]  And this is the new Green Deal.
[02:22:23.601 --> 02:22:25.522]  The post-human era is here.
[02:22:26.463 --> 02:22:33.128]  By a bunch of selfish rich billionaires with huge estates and private jets telling you you can't have a car, go on vacation.
[02:22:33.789 --> 02:22:37.211]  This is a giant authoritarian power grab by eugenicists.
[02:22:37.592 --> 02:22:39.813]  I've been aware of their operation for decades.
[02:22:39.913 --> 02:22:43.096]  I've made films, I've written books, I've exposed them in their own words.
[02:22:43.696 --> 02:22:46.579]  But now it's not all beta test, it's not all theoretical.
[02:22:47.499 --> 02:23:03.175]  Now they're going operational against you and your family, and you can decide to have Stockholm Syndrome, and love your abusers, and lie to yourself, or you can decide to have the power that God gave you to start speaking out, to start saying no, and to start researching all this information and educating others.
[02:23:04.336 --> 02:23:05.818]  The choice is now out in the open.
[02:23:07.854 --> 02:23:17.457]  Decide, whether you want to have a pro-human future, or whether you're going to allow these anti-human monsters to take control of human destiny, and the future of all our lives.
[02:23:18.638 --> 02:23:23.119]  The good news is, for those of you in denial, you're not going to have to wait for the dystopia anymore.
[02:23:23.580 --> 02:23:24.740]  It's going to come very, very quickly.
[02:23:24.760 --> 02:23:31.502]  And you're going to find that compliance with this... Hello, hello!
[02:23:31.903 --> 02:23:34.083]  Great to be on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:23:34.103 --> 02:23:35.904]  And here we are!
[02:23:38.781 --> 02:23:40.462]  It's so sad what's going on.
[02:23:40.482 --> 02:23:49.585]  To think, in just a few months, they've sapped joy out of life.
[02:23:50.445 --> 02:23:52.726]  I shouldn't be smiling, I might get arrested.
[02:23:53.926 --> 02:23:55.707]  They sapped joy out of life.
[02:23:57.167 --> 02:24:00.688]  And they've come up with their new abnormal.
[02:24:02.769 --> 02:24:06.410]  And we're supposed to behave like these freaks that are freaks.
[02:24:07.250 --> 02:24:09.532]  That's their normal, is to be a freak.
[02:24:09.912 --> 02:24:16.258]  The politicians, polytics, many tics, sucking the life out of us, right in front of our eyes.
[02:24:17.699 --> 02:24:18.921]  And most people believe it.
[02:24:21.203 --> 02:24:24.586]  It's so dark in what's going on.
[02:24:26.547 --> 02:24:28.489]  Again, they've sapped the joy out of life.
[02:24:28.529 --> 02:24:29.650]  You can't make this up.
[02:24:31.492 --> 02:24:33.634]  Because that's all they're doing, is they're making it up.
[02:24:35.083 --> 02:24:36.523]  You know, we have the Trends Journal.
[02:24:36.543 --> 02:24:37.783]  It's a weekly magazine.
[02:24:38.704 --> 02:24:40.344]  And we're finishing this issue.
[02:24:40.424 --> 02:24:41.724]  It goes out tomorrow.
[02:24:42.904 --> 02:24:45.965]  And I'm writing about all the lockdowns that are going on.
[02:24:48.425 --> 02:24:49.626]  And now they're opening them up.
[02:24:52.146 --> 02:24:53.126]  And they're making it up.
[02:24:54.086 --> 02:24:57.067]  There's no scientific data for what they're doing.
[02:24:58.127 --> 02:25:00.048]  It's a science fiction movie.
[02:25:01.328 --> 02:25:02.668]  Right in front of our eyes.
[02:25:04.252 --> 02:25:09.855]  Oh, in this state we're going to say 50% occupancy.
[02:25:10.255 --> 02:25:13.436]  Well, no, we're going to say 25% occupancy.
[02:25:14.977 --> 02:25:21.420]  We're going to call like that little gruesome Newsome over there and the other daddy's boy Cuomo over here.
[02:25:21.440 --> 02:25:27.202]  We're going to tell you what businesses are essential and who isn't.
[02:25:28.923 --> 02:25:33.145]  So now in California, they opened up some businesses, but only curbside service.
[02:25:34.363 --> 02:25:35.643]  And among them, florists.
[02:25:37.024 --> 02:25:39.645]  Oh, florists, they're essential businesses.
[02:25:40.485 --> 02:25:43.606]  What is Newsom's family in the flower business?
[02:25:45.806 --> 02:25:56.490]  And in a lot of states, New York included, can't go to bars, can't go to restaurants and have a good time, but you can buy all the booze you want from the stores.
[02:25:56.990 --> 02:25:58.530]  That's an essential business.
[02:25:59.431 --> 02:26:04.172]  These are the same low-life pieces of garbage crap from that political family
[02:26:04.650 --> 02:26:09.351]  That gave us prohibition in the 1920s.
[02:26:12.212 --> 02:26:14.152]  Roaring 20s to be prohibition.
[02:26:14.172 --> 02:26:15.413]  Then the depression happens.
[02:26:16.773 --> 02:26:18.213]  Let's get rid of prohibition.
[02:26:18.233 --> 02:26:24.175]  You know, we'll do with politicians, politics will suck the life out of you.
[02:26:24.215 --> 02:26:25.755]  We'll suck taxes from you.
[02:26:26.495 --> 02:26:32.237]  We have a Great Depression, but now we're going to lift prohibition and we're going to make it OK to drink.
[02:26:33.337 --> 02:26:33.577]  Great.
[02:26:35.213 --> 02:26:36.974]  And we're going to tax the hell out of you.
[02:26:38.835 --> 02:26:45.719]  We'll cost you $10, you cost you $2, but we got all these different taxes on there.
[02:26:46.560 --> 02:26:48.041]  So we're poly-tics.
[02:26:48.101 --> 02:26:51.243]  We suck it out of you, so we don't have to work.
[02:26:52.263 --> 02:26:58.687]  We don't have to worry about losing our jobs, paying for our health care, our rent, our mortgages, or our retirement.
[02:26:58.727 --> 02:26:59.488]  We got the best.
[02:26:59.548 --> 02:27:00.528]  We're poly-tics.
[02:27:00.949 --> 02:27:03.130]  So we steal your money in the name of taxes.
[02:27:04.025 --> 02:27:06.806]  And that's what they've done over here in New York and other states.
[02:27:08.826 --> 02:27:12.247]  So buying booze is an essential business.
[02:27:13.708 --> 02:27:17.829]  I'm mentioning this because they're opening up bit by bit and piece by piece.
[02:27:20.570 --> 02:27:24.951]  As I well said on David's night show on Infowars.
[02:27:26.932 --> 02:27:28.412]  Over a year ago, March.
[02:27:30.753 --> 02:27:32.073]  A year ago this last March.
[02:27:35.623 --> 02:27:37.324]  We're going into the greatest depression.
[02:27:39.165 --> 02:27:41.147]  There's a slowdown going on globally.
[02:27:41.207 --> 02:27:42.988]  I only put out the numbers and the facts.
[02:27:44.188 --> 02:27:46.370]  There was a recession down there in Mexico.
[02:27:46.390 --> 02:27:49.892]  Oh, and how about that place over there called Germany?
[02:27:50.472 --> 02:27:50.833]  Oh, yeah.
[02:27:50.893 --> 02:27:55.976]  One of the biggest industrial centers in the world, the highest quality product of industrialization.
[02:27:56.496 --> 02:27:59.218]  Oh, they were going into recession, too, as was the eurozone.
[02:28:01.681 --> 02:28:13.808]  Now, opening up businesses bit by bit and piece by piece, and having these political freaks make up these laws, like you got this jerk over here in Ocean City, New Jersey.
[02:28:13.828 --> 02:28:19.811]  Oh, you could go surfing and this and that, but you can't lie on the beach.
[02:28:21.792 --> 02:28:23.993]  Other places, you can't walk on the boardwalk.
[02:28:25.434 --> 02:28:28.796]  Hey, stupid moron, imbecile jerk!
[02:28:30.092 --> 02:28:32.673]  Low-life piece of garbage.
[02:28:33.953 --> 02:28:36.594]  Governor this, mayor that.
[02:28:39.075 --> 02:28:41.956]  Controller you-know-who or whatever.
[02:28:43.256 --> 02:28:45.777]  Did you ever hear of vitamin D?
[02:28:47.918 --> 02:28:48.478]  Dopey.
[02:28:53.019 --> 02:28:53.419]  Jerk.
[02:28:56.020 --> 02:28:58.441]  One study coming out after another.
[02:28:59.093 --> 02:29:01.294]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[02:29:01.314 --> 02:29:15.018]  How vitamin D helps prevent diseases, including COVID-19.
[02:29:15.038 --> 02:29:19.039]  Hey, how about that place called Haiti?
[02:29:19.939 --> 02:29:22.720]  Oh yeah, one of the highest living standards in the world, huh?
[02:29:22.740 --> 02:29:25.421]  Yeah, I'm saying that facetiously.
[02:29:26.821 --> 02:29:28.882]  Do they have a COVID epidemic?
[02:29:32.179 --> 02:29:34.460]  How about Cambodia?
[02:29:36.361 --> 02:29:38.521]  No, no, hardly anybody dead over there either.
[02:29:41.442 --> 02:29:44.784]  Couldn't like being out there in the sunlight's good for you, huh?
[02:29:45.764 --> 02:29:47.345]  No, we're going to be morons.
[02:29:47.825 --> 02:29:51.226]  We're imbecile, arrogant jerks.
[02:29:52.607 --> 02:29:53.767]  Polytics.
[02:29:54.487 --> 02:29:57.068]  I tell people, Google up the definition of politician.
[02:29:57.549 --> 02:30:01.210]  Someone who's manipulative and devious, typically to gain advancement within an organization.
[02:30:02.125 --> 02:30:07.228]  Morons, imbeciles, the people you hated in high school and college that wanted to be class president.
[02:30:09.069 --> 02:30:13.631]  The way they're opening up this economy is only going to drag it down.
[02:30:14.411 --> 02:30:17.193]  The equity markets have nothing to do with the real world.
[02:30:18.374 --> 02:30:22.736]  You saw the numbers coming out last week on unemployment.
[02:30:23.556 --> 02:30:29.079]  And then the Labor Department admitted, the Labor Department admitted that that number of 14.5% unemployment is off.
[02:30:31.397 --> 02:30:32.017]  It's more like 20%.
[02:30:32.217 --> 02:30:36.920]  Hey, what was it during the Great Depression?
[02:30:36.940 --> 02:30:39.861]  Hmm.
[02:30:40.361 --> 02:30:39.861]  25%.
[02:30:42.062 --> 02:30:44.003]  The Greatest Depression has just begun.
[02:30:45.664 --> 02:30:47.485]  It's time to prepare for the future.
[02:30:47.505 --> 02:30:51.627]  They're leading us into hell.
[02:30:52.928 --> 02:30:54.428]  Right in front of our eyes.
[02:30:59.311 --> 02:30:59.991]  You better start
[02:31:00.427 --> 02:31:01.927]  Getting in the best shape you can.
[02:31:03.668 --> 02:31:05.688]  Physically, spiritually, emotionally.
[02:31:05.708 --> 02:31:11.650]  And on the physical end, of course, InfoWars stores have some great products.
[02:31:14.531 --> 02:31:21.993]  And on preparing for the future, Trends Journal brings you their history before it happens.
[02:31:23.613 --> 02:31:25.914]  So InfoWars, Trends Journal.
[02:31:26.754 --> 02:31:27.534]  Be prepared.
[02:31:28.735 --> 02:31:36.236]  We're going into a crisis beyond the imagination of the wildest dream.
[02:31:37.217 --> 02:31:45.158]  And if you don't believe in a wildest dream, let's go back three months ago when the COVID crisis began.
[02:31:45.178 --> 02:31:49.699]  The first thing people did was go out and buy toilet paper.
[02:31:50.579 --> 02:31:51.619]  That's how bad it is.
[02:31:52.420 --> 02:31:54.340]  We'll be back in just a few.
[02:31:55.600 --> 02:31:56.540]  Hello, hello!
[02:31:56.780 --> 02:31:58.961]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show!
[02:32:00.141 --> 02:32:04.463]  I was talking about the, um, the freaks in charge.
[02:32:06.463 --> 02:32:14.486]  And then there's the, uh, the media, who really started hyping this COVID-19.
[02:32:15.346 --> 02:32:20.988]  We did a story back on January 28th in the Trends Journal, the cover read, Coronavirus!
[02:32:21.688 --> 02:32:23.349]  106 dead in China!
[02:32:23.709 --> 02:32:24.129]  And we put,
[02:32:24.925 --> 02:32:27.086]  1.4 billion still alive.
[02:32:28.666 --> 02:32:39.290]  So it was the media that hyped this and we showed how Jeff Zucker with the CNN, the guy that runs the show, told his staff to keep promoting it, keep pumping it.
[02:32:40.130 --> 02:32:42.991]  And then there's the toilet paper record, the New York Times.
[02:32:43.832 --> 02:32:45.212]  You see all these marks on the paper?
[02:32:45.232 --> 02:32:45.972]  That's how I read.
[02:32:46.032 --> 02:32:49.013]  I mark up important points and stories.
[02:32:50.514 --> 02:32:51.734]  This story last week.
[02:32:52.114 --> 02:32:53.895]  Virus batters some areas.
[02:32:55.373 --> 02:32:56.694]  Why does it spare others?
[02:32:58.235 --> 02:33:02.919]  Researchers hunting for patterns to explain wide variations in infection rate.
[02:33:04.040 --> 02:33:09.105]  The Dominican Republic has reported nearly 7,600 cases of the virus.
[02:33:10.326 --> 02:33:14.789]  Just across the border, Haiti has about 85.
[02:33:15.210 --> 02:33:18.412]  Okay, Haiti has about 85.
[02:33:18.452 --> 02:33:19.273]  15 dead as we speak.
[02:33:23.953 --> 02:33:25.935]  You can't get poorer than Haiti, right?
[02:33:27.596 --> 02:33:30.398]  And again, they are making this point because they're locking us down.
[02:33:35.802 --> 02:33:37.203]  And sun is good for you.
[02:33:37.223 --> 02:33:38.844]  The vitamin D facts are there.
[02:33:38.884 --> 02:33:44.048]  But here's how also the toilet paper record, they call themselves the paper record.
[02:33:44.349 --> 02:33:46.050]  But this thing's only good for one thing.
[02:33:46.470 --> 02:33:47.691]  It may be the next crisis.
[02:33:47.731 --> 02:33:53.676]  People will run out and get the New York Times rather than those other toilet papers.
[02:33:55.154 --> 02:34:08.557]  Many developing nations with hot climates and young populations have escaped the worst, suggesting that the temperatures and demographics could be factors.
[02:34:09.438 --> 02:34:21.821]  But countries like Peru, Indonesia and Brazil, tropical countries in the throes of growing epidemics,
[02:34:24.013 --> 02:34:26.595]  Throw cold water on that idea.
[02:34:28.217 --> 02:34:30.138]  Throw cold water on that idea.
[02:34:31.619 --> 02:34:32.220]  Brazil.
[02:34:34.061 --> 02:34:34.702]  Let's see.
[02:34:35.142 --> 02:34:36.423]  Brazil has about 212 million people.
[02:34:36.443 --> 02:34:37.744]  212 million people.
[02:34:37.784 --> 02:34:39.406]  They have a grand total of 11,207 deaths.
[02:34:54.139 --> 02:34:54.720]  As of now.
[02:34:56.341 --> 02:34:57.902]  That's no percentage at all.
[02:34:58.502 --> 02:35:03.726]  How many people got killed in those Brazilian slums yesterday or for the year so far?
[02:35:05.147 --> 02:35:16.296]  How about the other poverty issues and other illnesses affecting probably tens of millions of Brazilians?
[02:35:16.994 --> 02:35:21.816]  We won't say that, Salenti, because we're the toilet paper of record.
[02:35:22.296 --> 02:35:23.876]  The New York slime.
[02:35:26.677 --> 02:35:29.158]  Oh, and what other did they mention?
[02:35:29.578 --> 02:35:29.778]  Peru.
[02:35:29.798 --> 02:35:30.198]  Peru.
[02:35:30.218 --> 02:35:31.899]  33 million people.
[02:35:31.919 --> 02:35:33.460]  7,887 deaths.
[02:35:33.540 --> 02:35:35.180]  Out of 30 million people.
[02:35:47.131 --> 02:35:47.891]  Well, 33 million.
[02:35:50.072 --> 02:35:53.253]  And how about the poverty issues over there in Peru?
[02:35:54.713 --> 02:35:57.114]  How about the other things that are bringing people down?
[02:35:58.594 --> 02:36:01.835]  And like, maybe they're doing what they're doing in the United States.
[02:36:03.416 --> 02:36:04.856]  And I'm not making this up.
[02:36:05.877 --> 02:36:13.819]  Matter of fact, they tried to make fun of it and call it a conspiracy theory as this
[02:36:14.457 --> 02:36:20.920]  Clown that America loves so much, the guy that plays the greatest health expert in the world, this guy Fauci.
[02:36:21.220 --> 02:36:27.582]  Fauci means jaw in Italian, and all this little boy is doing is jawboning that Fauci jaw, yeah.
[02:36:28.743 --> 02:36:40.568]  He made fun of this Dr. Jensen from Michigan who's noted that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
[02:36:43.564 --> 02:36:53.091]  Have added, quote, presumed cause of death, even if a diagnosis is not confirmed by a test.
[02:36:56.174 --> 02:36:56.374]  Huh.
[02:37:00.437 --> 02:37:01.158]  Isn't that something?
[02:37:02.539 --> 02:37:03.239]  Presumed.
[02:37:03.900 --> 02:37:05.221]  We don't have to test you.
[02:37:06.882 --> 02:37:10.525]  So going back to the numbers in Columbia,
[02:37:11.488 --> 02:37:13.809]  Even at 11,000, how many have been tested?
[02:37:19.972 --> 02:37:23.514]  Then we go to Indonesia, they mentioned.
[02:37:23.754 --> 02:37:24.755]  Oh, Indonesia.
[02:37:24.775 --> 02:37:25.415]  Hmm.
[02:37:27.096 --> 02:37:28.077]  Indonesia.
[02:37:28.997 --> 02:37:29.397]  You ready?
[02:37:29.417 --> 02:37:30.718]  273,526,000 deaths.
[02:37:42.500 --> 02:37:45.182]  They have the grand total of 911 deaths.
[02:37:45.202 --> 02:37:45.682]  That's right.
[02:37:45.702 --> 02:37:47.063]  911 deaths.
[02:37:47.143 --> 02:37:50.865]  In a country of 274 million people.
[02:37:50.885 --> 02:37:55.128]  Yet, the toilet paper pumps this up
[02:38:14.139 --> 02:38:18.381]  As though it's a mystery of who's dying.
[02:38:18.401 --> 02:38:22.323]  The facts are in the numbers.
[02:38:25.464 --> 02:38:36.669]  The Kaiser Health Foundation came out and said between a half to 30% of the deaths in America
[02:38:41.448 --> 02:38:44.290]  Are from chronically ill people from nursing homes.
[02:38:45.871 --> 02:39:10.469]  The other facts, documented facts, in Utrends Journal, and I'm sure they've said it on InfoWars, obesity, diabetics, people suffering from lung disease, heart ailments, respiratory problems,
[02:39:11.650 --> 02:39:15.733]  People that are chronically ill are the ones that are going.
[02:39:17.674 --> 02:39:18.775]  These are facts.
[02:39:20.075 --> 02:39:25.399]  The obesity numbers are real, as are the other ones, diabetics, lung disease.
[02:39:26.019 --> 02:39:28.141]  Healthy people aren't dying of this.
[02:39:32.163 --> 02:39:37.427]  In the reporting from Associated Press,
[02:39:39.735 --> 02:39:59.381]  They keep mentioning over and over that, quote, in their articles, after they report something, in the middle of it, for most people the coronavirus causes mild or modest symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two or three weeks.
[02:40:00.301 --> 02:40:09.464]  For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe life-threatening illnesses, including
[02:40:10.174 --> 02:40:12.574]  Pneumonia and death.
[02:40:14.055 --> 02:40:14.395]  All right?
[02:40:15.555 --> 02:40:16.715]  That's who's dying.
[02:40:17.875 --> 02:40:38.339]  However, the economic devastation brought to the United States of America with a K in there, take out the C because we become the Nazi Stasi state and a combination of the Soviet Union and China.
[02:40:41.852 --> 02:40:48.256]  With the loss of our freedoms, our Bill of Rights, our Constitution robbed from us.
[02:40:51.778 --> 02:40:52.959]  All the facts are there.
[02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:57.421]  But all they do is keep selling fear and hype.
[02:40:58.442 --> 02:41:00.323]  Just like they did after 9-11.
[02:41:01.584 --> 02:41:02.725]  Coronavirus 9-11.
[02:41:02.845 --> 02:41:07.067]  That was one of our other Transjournal covers.
[02:41:09.108 --> 02:41:09.949]  Selling terror.
[02:41:11.049 --> 02:41:12.489]  And they've terrorized the people.
[02:41:13.590 --> 02:41:15.130]  But we're born to be free.
[02:41:15.950 --> 02:41:17.431]  And that's why we're on InfoWars.
[02:41:18.231 --> 02:41:20.312]  Back on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:41:20.372 --> 02:41:21.172]  Great being here.
[02:41:21.192 --> 02:41:26.833]  I want to thank everybody for tuning in and all the staff and all the great work that InfoWars does.
[02:41:26.873 --> 02:41:35.496]  Remember, to keep the truth alive, you got to put your money where your mind and heart and soul is because we're losing a big time.
[02:41:36.316 --> 02:41:39.297]  InfoWars stores has some great deals like
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:47.622]  Living Defense Plus with 50% off their incredible high demand intestinal cleanse product.
[02:41:47.722 --> 02:41:52.964]  Living Defense Plus is quickly selling out at 50% off.
[02:41:53.884 --> 02:42:02.547]  Alongside DNA Force Plus, it can help boost your defenses and change your life while funding the InfoWars team.
[02:42:02.607 --> 02:42:03.968]  And that's really important.
[02:42:04.028 --> 02:42:05.668]  Two big issues here.
[02:42:06.448 --> 02:42:08.409]  Boosting your defense and changing
[02:42:09.116 --> 02:42:12.560]  Your life while funding the InfoWars team.
[02:42:13.020 --> 02:42:19.348]  So there's no more important time than today to make sure you're supporting your body and helping your gut.
[02:42:20.008 --> 02:42:29.319]  By securing your bottle today, you'll start eliminating toxic organisms from your body naturally without harmful chemicals.
[02:42:30.276 --> 02:42:37.219]  Keep unwarranted vaders out and promote a healthy intestinal micro-balance for a happier healthy gut.
[02:42:37.699 --> 02:42:45.862]  Living Defense uses organic herbs and enzymes to help naturally cleanse harmful organisms from the body.
[02:42:46.542 --> 02:42:54.765]  Just read some of the reviews on InfoWarsLife.com and see what Living Defense is doing for listeners.
[02:42:55.525 --> 02:42:59.367]  Stock up and start cleansing now at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:43:00.091 --> 02:43:04.353]  Before they sell out again of this incredible 50% off deal.
[02:43:04.933 --> 02:43:07.755]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[02:43:09.475 --> 02:43:17.039]  So, again, put your money where your heart is, because you can see how they're trying to censor us.
[02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:24.042]  Again, I read to you the New York Times, how they go after people, make statements without facts.
[02:43:25.543 --> 02:43:29.445]  It went after that Dr. Jensen, from him saying that
[02:43:31.203 --> 02:43:42.111]  What they were doing is putting suspected deaths in as COVID deaths without testing.
[02:43:42.892 --> 02:43:52.179]  And also they did that because when somebody dies of COVID in the hospital, they get more money.
[02:43:52.199 --> 02:43:54.000]  That's right.
[02:43:54.020 --> 02:43:55.221]  And I'm not making that up.
[02:43:55.942 --> 02:43:59.024]  In fact, even USA Today did a story on that one.
[02:44:00.552 --> 02:44:07.896]  So, we're looking here at what's going on, what's real, and what they're telling us.
[02:44:09.577 --> 02:44:23.105]  And when you look at the facts, you can see how easy it is to send people to war based on lies, because that's all they're doing again, is selling us more and more lies.
[02:44:24.046 --> 02:44:29.889]  Alex Jones is saying, on that piece of intro, some of the
[02:44:30.987 --> 02:44:32.347]  Products that are being sold.
[02:44:32.848 --> 02:44:35.589]  About how this economy is going down so badly.
[02:44:36.489 --> 02:44:38.890]  As I said, we're going into the greatest depression.
[02:44:38.930 --> 02:44:42.311]  This is going to be worse than the Great Depression.
[02:44:45.272 --> 02:44:48.393]  Neiman Marcus seeks bankruptcy protection.
[02:44:48.613 --> 02:44:49.413]  This is last week.
[02:44:50.173 --> 02:44:53.114]  Virus spurs bankruptcy for Canadian chain.
[02:44:54.535 --> 02:44:55.195]  Aldo Group.
[02:44:57.256 --> 02:44:58.256]  That was last Thursday.
[02:45:00.467 --> 02:45:05.408]  Up to 15% of Rolls-Royce jobs face acts in planned shake-up.
[02:45:06.388 --> 02:45:10.649]  Virgin Atlantic to slash a third of staff and leave Gatwick.
[02:45:11.729 --> 02:45:14.009]  Wish they'd been there for some 35 years.
[02:45:14.910 --> 02:45:16.070]  Glassdoor.
[02:45:17.570 --> 02:45:18.710]  That crashed.
[02:45:18.730 --> 02:45:21.131]  They're laying off 30% of their staff.
[02:45:22.291 --> 02:45:27.832]  Raytheon to cut costs $2 billion furlough staff.
[02:45:29.503 --> 02:45:35.344]  EU forecasts a sharp slide into recession.
[02:45:37.105 --> 02:45:39.225]  Euro weakens after Germans.
[02:45:39.905 --> 02:45:40.725]  Oh, that's a different one.
[02:45:40.745 --> 02:45:41.446]  I'll talk about that.
[02:45:41.506 --> 02:45:43.946]  Germans challenge on ECB stimulus.
[02:45:44.546 --> 02:45:50.727]  Eurozone stability falters under pandemic impact warns Brussels.
[02:45:51.588 --> 02:45:53.608]  It's not the pandemic impact.
[02:45:54.128 --> 02:45:57.909]  It's the impact brought to us by demented
[02:45:58.362 --> 02:45:59.383]  Politicians.
[02:46:00.663 --> 02:46:05.506]  By psychopaths, sociopaths, and pathological liars.
[02:46:07.187 --> 02:46:09.389]  It's not the coronavirus that did this.
[02:46:12.190 --> 02:46:14.031]  It's the sick people in charge.
[02:46:15.532 --> 02:46:26.179]  Again, going back to the United States and going back to the other countries I was talking about, like a place like Haiti, where poverty is rampant and they only have 35 or 19 deaths
[02:46:31.678 --> 02:46:42.441]  America's suffering from obesity, and that's one of the major causes of death other than the elderly in nursing homes.
[02:46:42.921 --> 02:46:46.202]  42% of Americans are obese.
[02:46:46.222 --> 02:46:47.703]  70% are overweight.
[02:46:51.484 --> 02:46:55.845]  And then there's smoking-related diseases that are adding up to this.
[02:46:56.226 --> 02:47:00.867]  Again, quarantine the ill, free the healthy.
[02:47:05.123 --> 02:47:11.868]  Eurozone recovery will take three years, warns European Central Bank economist.
[02:47:13.729 --> 02:47:20.673]  Mortgage-backed debt under pressure as hotel owners fail to make payments.
[02:47:22.114 --> 02:47:25.657]  Look at the stupid freaks that are making up these things.
[02:47:26.257 --> 02:47:28.939]  Now when you get on an airplane, you have to wear a mask.
[02:47:30.059 --> 02:47:31.841]  Isn't it fun to fly already?
[02:47:31.861 --> 02:47:33.802]  You get felt up when you go to the airport.
[02:47:34.124 --> 02:47:36.026]  And they pack you in like sardines?
[02:47:37.527 --> 02:47:40.169]  Because I go back to the days when flying was fun.
[02:47:43.411 --> 02:47:43.752]  Yeah.
[02:47:45.153 --> 02:47:45.753]  Anyway.
[02:47:47.254 --> 02:47:48.796]  Now you gotta wear masks.
[02:47:49.596 --> 02:47:52.018]  Won't it be fun to eat and drink with masks?
[02:47:52.719 --> 02:47:54.140]  And to socially distance?
[02:47:55.941 --> 02:47:59.464]  The tourism business is... It's hit hard.
[02:47:59.484 --> 02:48:01.706]  I gotta tell you, man.
[02:48:02.426 --> 02:48:04.707]  Trump is really taking a hit on this too.
[02:48:05.287 --> 02:48:11.290]  All them hotels at Mar-a-Lago and that one down in D.C.
[02:48:11.330 --> 02:48:12.990]  that was doing booming business.
[02:48:15.771 --> 02:48:18.813]  So this is hurting a lot of people up and down the line.
[02:48:19.653 --> 02:48:21.094]  This isn't going to come back.
[02:48:26.076 --> 02:48:27.096]  What else do we have here?
[02:48:27.776 --> 02:48:29.037]  Ah, virus threats.
[02:48:30.713 --> 02:48:33.815]  10 billion euro hit to footballers' value.
[02:48:33.835 --> 02:48:37.337]  These are the teams out there, just like the ones in the United States.
[02:48:38.418 --> 02:48:40.319]  People aren't going to want to go to stadiums.
[02:48:41.800 --> 02:48:42.801]  Music industry?
[02:48:43.601 --> 02:48:46.763]  Our musicians are struggling even in the best of time.
[02:48:48.424 --> 02:48:49.345]  And now they're out of work.
[02:48:50.185 --> 02:48:59.471]  And now these moron, jerk, imbecile, low-life pieces of garbage crap, politicians, politics, sucking the blood out of us, make up stuff.
[02:49:00.114 --> 02:49:01.755]  This is from the Wall Street Journal.
[02:49:02.676 --> 02:49:05.017]  Berlin moves to reopen nation's economy.
[02:49:06.979 --> 02:49:14.444]  Some restaurants will be permitted to open by end of May if they keep tables six and a half feet apart.
[02:49:16.285 --> 02:49:16.905]  Oh, yeah, great.
[02:49:16.985 --> 02:49:17.966]  Who's making up six?
[02:49:18.426 --> 02:49:19.807]  I say six feet.
[02:49:21.408 --> 02:49:22.149]  Twelve inches.
[02:49:23.390 --> 02:49:23.930]  No, no.
[02:49:24.650 --> 02:49:25.431]  Six and a half feet.
[02:49:26.011 --> 02:49:26.452]  No, no, no.
[02:49:27.993 --> 02:49:28.313]  All right.
[02:49:28.905 --> 02:49:30.265]  You're making this crap up.
[02:49:30.325 --> 02:49:30.725]  You ready?
[02:49:33.646 --> 02:49:36.607]  Many restrictions will remain.
[02:49:36.947 --> 02:49:46.829]  Only people from no more than two separate households will be allowed to meet outside their home between now and June 5th.
[02:49:47.929 --> 02:49:52.270]  People will have to keep about six feet apart when outside.
[02:49:52.290 --> 02:49:54.230]  Hey, wait a minute.
[02:49:54.550 --> 02:49:55.851]  In America, six feet apart.
[02:49:56.251 --> 02:49:57.531]  Why five feet apart?
[02:49:59.964 --> 02:50:00.504]  Belgium!
[02:50:02.085 --> 02:50:14.211]  Families and friends would be allowed to meet again under one roof, but only under a maximum of four guests for each home, and always with the same people.
[02:50:17.292 --> 02:50:18.993]  You're making this crap up!
[02:50:20.733 --> 02:50:23.034]  You can't... This is a grade B movie!
[02:50:26.016 --> 02:50:26.296]  This is...
[02:50:26.994 --> 02:50:30.316]  Yeah, they got a farmer's market out here now, and they used to be on the street.
[02:50:30.336 --> 02:50:33.558]  They put it in the parking lot across the street, the county office building.
[02:50:34.439 --> 02:50:36.360]  You gotta give your name before you go there.
[02:50:37.821 --> 02:50:38.962]  You gotta wear a mask.
[02:50:40.883 --> 02:50:42.364]  And you have to be six foot apart.
[02:50:43.444 --> 02:50:45.085]  The wind is blowing everywhere.
[02:50:45.105 --> 02:50:49.688]  Oh, you don't need a mask mask.
[02:50:50.029 --> 02:50:54.371]  You can wear a bandana, you can wear... They're making this stuff up.
[02:50:54.411 --> 02:50:55.352]  The wind is blowing.
[02:50:56.701 --> 02:51:02.505]  These masks aren't, and what some organizations are saying, you shouldn't be wearing masks.
[02:51:03.426 --> 02:51:05.388]  No, you're a conspiracy theorist for saying that.
[02:51:06.208 --> 02:51:07.789]  They don't know what they're doing.
[02:51:08.470 --> 02:51:14.855]  They have destroyed our lives, destroyed joy, beauty, love, and liberty, and they've destroyed the global economy.
[02:51:16.716 --> 02:51:18.398]  The Greatest Depression has begun.
[02:51:19.078 --> 02:51:20.199]  You better prepare now.
[02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:23.301]  Stock up with InfoWars.
[02:51:23.942 --> 02:51:25.363]  Be prepared for the future.
[02:51:28.041 --> 02:51:29.722]  Remember they used to make fun of preppers.
[02:51:30.462 --> 02:51:34.264]  And prepare for the future by subscribing to the Trends Journal.
[02:51:45.770 --> 02:51:49.072]  We told you what was going to happen and it did.
[02:51:49.492 --> 02:51:51.813]  Now we're telling you what's coming.
[02:51:51.873 --> 02:51:52.153]  Band.Video.
[02:52:00.211 --> 02:52:02.854]  I'm cutting this ad on May 10th, 2020.
[02:52:03.014 --> 02:52:10.300]  And within a week or so, many of the best-selling items that we're selling at InfoWareStore.com will no longer be at 50% off.
[02:52:10.801 --> 02:52:17.467]  In fact, last year I said I can't get 50% off anymore because our markup just isn't enough for us to be able to get enough profit to operate this operation.
[02:52:17.928 --> 02:52:20.890]  But I want you to get the ultimate krill oil.
[02:52:21.010 --> 02:52:22.952]  I want you to get Bazzo Beets.
[02:52:23.052 --> 02:52:25.114]  I want you to get DNA Force Plus.
[02:52:25.234 --> 02:52:25.755]  I want you
[02:52:26.075 --> 02:52:27.036]  We're good to go.
[02:53:00.109 --> 02:53:04.153]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history.
[02:53:04.674 --> 02:53:07.617]  The globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off.
[02:53:07.857 --> 02:53:10.480]  And they're like, yeah, you're taking implantable chips.
[02:53:10.880 --> 02:53:12.422]  Yeah, we're into pedophilia.
[02:53:12.662 --> 02:53:14.224]  Yeah, we're into world government.
[02:53:14.424 --> 02:53:15.645]  Yeah, you're obsolete.
[02:53:16.306 --> 02:53:17.347]  You are non-essential.
[02:53:18.328 --> 02:53:19.850]  We are shutting your ass down.
[02:53:20.130 --> 02:53:24.775]  Yeah, we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore.
[02:53:24.995 --> 02:53:26.336]  You're going to be the service economy.
[02:53:26.657 --> 02:53:31.842]  And now the globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy and you're obsolete.
[02:53:32.042 --> 02:53:37.187]  So you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance income so they can dictate your life.
[02:53:37.748 --> 02:53:40.010]  The handcuffs are going on right now.
[02:53:40.370 --> 02:53:42.852]  We have to resist and say no to the New World Order.
[02:53:43.032 --> 02:53:45.333]  And that takes you understanding you were right.
[02:53:45.714 --> 02:53:46.954]  And understanding I was right.
[02:53:47.215 --> 02:53:51.738]  And getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can.
[02:53:51.978 --> 02:53:53.299]  Now is the time for action.
[02:53:53.779 --> 02:53:57.562]  Now is the time for you to shine and be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[02:54:27.102 --> 02:54:32.706]  It's now more critical than ever to keep InfoWars on the air.
[02:54:33.406 --> 02:54:37.269]  Everything we warned of for decades is now emerged.
[02:54:37.609 --> 02:54:39.870]  It was always there, but now it's uncloaked.
[02:54:40.230 --> 02:54:41.171]  It's out in the open.
[02:54:41.431 --> 02:54:44.673]  And our credibility, your credibility, has gone to the stars.
[02:54:45.814 --> 02:54:52.420]  That's why they want to expunge and erase every documentary, every film, every article, every report, every interview.
[02:54:52.840 --> 02:54:54.662]  That's why they don't want to just silence Infowars.
[02:54:54.682 --> 02:55:01.128]  They want to silence medical doctors and scientists and members of Congress and leaders who tell the truth.
[02:55:01.988 --> 02:55:06.553]  But humanity is rallying against this threat.
[02:55:07.651 --> 02:55:12.616]  And now, ladies and gentlemen, is the time to spread the word like never before.
[02:55:12.636 --> 02:55:15.019]  I know I get up here and I say you are the Paul Reveres.
[02:55:15.719 --> 02:55:16.300]  But you know what?
[02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:20.684]  The evil we're facing is much more wicked and much more diabolical than King George III.
[02:55:23.517 --> 02:55:24.438]  260 years ago.
[02:55:25.099 --> 02:55:30.103]  These globalists want to dominate and take control of our very genetic code.
[02:55:30.443 --> 02:55:31.584]  They want to sterilize us.
[02:55:31.624 --> 02:55:32.545]  They want to erase us.
[02:55:32.565 --> 02:55:34.226]  They want to destroy our seed.
[02:55:34.626 --> 02:55:38.549]  They want hegemonic domination over every life form on the planet.
[02:55:38.790 --> 02:55:41.772]  They want to override it in their selfishness.
[02:55:43.053 --> 02:55:45.055]  And we can't let them do that.
[02:55:45.135 --> 02:55:47.757]  So I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, however you can,
[02:55:48.755 --> 02:55:49.676]  Realize you're a leader.
[02:55:50.276 --> 02:56:00.262]  Listening to local radio stations, watching local TV stations, going to newswars.com, going to band.video and finding the articles and the videos that you think are most important and most informative.
[02:56:01.252 --> 02:56:08.774]  And sharing those at the grocery store and at church and to your neighbors and to your friends and saying, hey, here's what's banned.
[02:56:09.054 --> 02:56:10.835]  Here's what they don't want you to know about.
[02:56:10.855 --> 02:56:14.596]  That's changing the world and that brings hope into the world.
[02:56:14.696 --> 02:56:18.897]  And people that weren't ready to wake up years ago, they're ready to wake up now.
[02:56:20.185 --> 02:56:22.786]  That's why the globalists wanted to shut us down all these years.
[02:56:22.846 --> 02:56:25.047]  That's why they wanted to silence us all these years.
[02:56:25.567 --> 02:56:29.529]  Because they knew that once their system emerged, we would have massive credibility.
[02:56:29.789 --> 02:56:32.770]  And so they hope people forget about what we said.
[02:56:33.170 --> 02:56:36.172]  They hope they forget about all the warnings.
[02:56:37.032 --> 02:56:38.133]  But people aren't forgetting.
[02:56:38.193 --> 02:56:39.353]  People are remembering.
[02:56:39.393 --> 02:56:44.395]  And remember what Jonathan Gruber said six years ago about Obamacare, who he wrote Obamacare.
[02:56:44.415 --> 02:56:45.576]  He said, Obama chose me.
[02:56:46.936 --> 02:56:53.399]  Because I came up with the best plan to triple prices and rip everyone off, and I was the most deceptive person.
[02:56:53.419 --> 02:56:55.379]  And he said, thank God they don't have memories.
[02:56:55.799 --> 02:56:57.140]  Thank God they're so stupid.
[02:56:57.200 --> 02:57:01.101]  But you do have memories for baseball or movies or things you like.
[02:57:01.502 --> 02:57:10.725]  Well, start focusing on politics and the world and the globalists, not because you like them, but because you want to defeat them and remember what they've done and expose them and see
[02:57:10.845 --> 02:57:17.290]  Celebrate exposing them and celebrate the First Amendment and the free speech that veterans fought and died to defend.
[02:57:17.570 --> 02:57:25.877]  Because those veterans and our forebears didn't create those rights, but they fought and bled to enshrine them and to get them openly practiced.
[02:57:27.446 --> 02:57:33.829]  So that they would become part of our culture and so that freedom would not pass from the world and so that we would not be slaves.
[02:57:34.469 --> 02:57:46.695]  So I tell you again, exercise these freedoms or lose them forever and tell everyone you know about the fight for freedom that goes on here, now more important than ever at InfoWars!
[02:57:47.395 --> 02:57:48.997]  We're going to be true until the end.
[02:57:49.338 --> 02:57:50.379]  I'm not going to back down.
[02:57:50.480 --> 02:57:51.501]  I'm not going to compromise.
[02:57:51.521 --> 02:57:59.292]  And I'm asking you not to back down or compromise because compromising with this, submitting to this, is worse than living death.
