[00:00:09.936 --> 00:00:11.037]  Big Brother.
[00:00:11.037 --> 00:00:12.898]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:12.898 --> 00:00:14.779]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:16.501]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:16.501 --> 00:00:18.162]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:18.162 --> 00:00:23.806]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.806 --> 00:00:25.847]  Well, everything has come clearly into view.
[00:00:25.847 --> 00:00:28.970]  We have a crystal clear image of exactly what the globalists are up to.
[00:00:29.935 --> 00:00:38.518]  And yes, it's overwhelming at many levels and quite frightening, but we have a chance to stop it if we take action now.
[00:00:38.518 --> 00:00:41.679]  And we've not been caught flat-footed by the world government.
[00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:50.321]  If you're a radio listener, well, you're not having to look at me right now, but I am wearing the Bill Gates uniform that now Mark Zuckerberg wears.
[00:00:50.321 --> 00:00:52.922]  It is a pink cashmere sweater.
[00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:02.275]  With a white collared shirt to look like Mr. Rogers or to look non-threatening.
[00:01:02.275 --> 00:01:08.938]  I've said it many times that if Hitler wore a pink uniform he would have won the war because he would have looked non-threatening.
[00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:16.943]  This is all done by image consultants and now you can notice that again Bill Gates is a front for the globalists so is Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:01:16.943 --> 00:01:21.005]  Now the two even appear on stage together wearing the pink uniform.
[00:01:22.301 --> 00:01:39.336]  And I think a week and a half ago when they had that record online stream at London Real with David Icke, over 1,300,000 viewers, outside of the YouTube, Twitter, Facebook combine, David Icke wore the Bill Gates uniform, I think to throw it back in their face.
[00:01:40.305 --> 00:01:49.127]  Maybe it was just a coincidence, but he's joining us in the third hour today, maybe a little bit in the fourth hour, then Gerald Cilente takes over.
[00:01:49.127 --> 00:01:58.529]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us with big developments from the UK coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:06.851]  Okay, that said, you've noticed these stacks of articles and documents and things here in front of me, maybe with an overhead panning shot.
[00:02:06.851 --> 00:02:07.851]  This is not a prop.
[00:02:09.232 --> 00:02:11.554]  I have read over and looked at all of these.
[00:02:11.554 --> 00:02:17.318]  This is enough to do 20 hours straight, not ever going back over one piece of information again.
[00:02:17.318 --> 00:02:20.721]  But I'm going to do my best to condense all of this down today.
[00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:25.324]  But the quickening is certainly here in many, many ways.
[00:02:25.324 --> 00:02:31.349]  Out of everything we have to cover, the most important is the big picture.
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.021]  COVID-19 is a hysteria.
[00:02:35.021 --> 00:02:53.046]  It is designed to usher in total surveillance, total control, medical tyranny, forced inoculation, and the tracking systems to make sure you've submitted to inoculation that is going to be used as the basis of a global social credit score and the cashless society with all the nightmare authoritarian ramifications.
[00:02:53.046 --> 00:02:56.987]  Because of course, many say, well, what do I have to hide?
[00:02:56.987 --> 00:03:01.748]  Many people will say, I'm going to go along with the system.
[00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:08.281]  But when you go along with the system and it's predatory, that doesn't get you ahead.
[00:03:08.281 --> 00:03:25.215]  If you were a sheep and there was a slaughter going on and you were conscious and knew that there was a slaughter, complying with going into the slaughterhouse is not brave, it's not altruistic, it's not stunning, it's not cool, it's stupid.
[00:03:25.215 --> 00:03:28.138]  And so that's exactly what's going on here.
[00:03:29.147 --> 00:03:37.115]  Now the big takeaway, well, everybody's obsessed with General Flynn being exonerated and obsessed with, oh, a couple people might have coronavirus in the White House.
[00:03:37.115 --> 00:03:38.796]  Oh, it's so scary.
[00:03:38.796 --> 00:03:42.600]  Oh, the coronavirus is making a comeback.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.064]  Funny, it never reached one-tenth of what they said it would, one-twentieth.
[00:03:47.064 --> 00:03:49.746]  But now they add all death statistics into the column.
[00:03:49.746 --> 00:03:51.548]  They can, oh, look, it came back.
[00:03:51.548 --> 00:03:52.289]  A hundred dead.
[00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:53.530]  Oh, a thousand dead.
[00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:54.091]  It came back.
[00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:58.020]  Almost everyone's had two, three surgeries.
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.501]  Heart failure, cancer, over 80 years old.
[00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:07.902]  But none of those facts, none of those realities matter because it's so fun to get into the hysteria.
[00:04:07.902 --> 00:04:14.424]  While the real fact is the third world is completely in cardiac arrest financially.
[00:04:15.916 --> 00:04:20.420]  Going into total starvation and we are going into collapse here as well.
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:29.508]  And so just like I told you 13 weeks ago, back in mid-January, that this COVID thing was the big globalist move to lock down society and get ready.
[00:04:29.508 --> 00:04:32.371]  And it took five, six weeks to see that happen.
[00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:33.071]  I'm telling you.
[00:04:34.053 --> 00:04:37.154]  A lot of folks are like, hey, a lot of folks are waking up to the COVID hysteria.
[00:04:37.154 --> 00:04:39.734]  Hey, this thing might dissipate.
[00:04:39.734 --> 00:04:40.775]  Oh, no.
[00:04:40.775 --> 00:04:43.015]  They have already triggered the global depression.
[00:04:43.015 --> 00:04:56.119]  And unless they get the blame for it, the globalists, they're going to continue to press the global depression while posing as saviors, giving us all the reasons we need to take forced inoculations and national ID cards to be able to go outside again.
[00:04:56.119 --> 00:04:57.199]  It's called being held hostage.
[00:04:59.198 --> 00:05:08.254]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chi-coms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[00:05:08.254 --> 00:05:12.241]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world.
[00:05:12.895 --> 00:05:19.441]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going to be.
[00:05:19.441 --> 00:05:25.407]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy.
[00:05:25.407 --> 00:05:33.855]  That's why we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[00:05:34.736 --> 00:05:36.597]  They've admitted all of this.
[00:05:36.597 --> 00:05:44.218]  So remember, how does Infowars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen?
[00:05:44.218 --> 00:05:48.399]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan.
[00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:49.620]  And yes, it's dystopic.
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.880]  And yes, it's scary.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.101]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[00:05:55.101 --> 00:05:58.102]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:13.554]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:13.554 --> 00:06:19.137]  Oh my gosh, we're told that Tim Downing Street had to quarantine people in the last few months and have lockdown.
[00:06:19.137 --> 00:06:30.603]  And we're also told that up to eight Secret Service agents have tested positive for COVID and the President is refusing to quarantine and so is the Vice President.
[00:06:30.603 --> 00:06:31.904]  What incredible traitors!
[00:06:33.905 --> 00:06:42.675]  Meanwhile, flights still bringing 15,000 people a day into the UK without virus testing, including travellers from China, Italy and the US.
[00:06:42.675 --> 00:06:44.578]  Oh, but you've got to stay in your home!
[00:06:44.578 --> 00:06:53.688]  And they've got a national poll out showing that 9 out of 10 in the UK want lockdown to carry on.
[00:06:55.188 --> 00:07:01.376]  Because they are such incredible heroes saving lives!
[00:07:01.376 --> 00:07:07.804]  Stay home, wear a mask, don't go outside and save lives!
[00:07:07.804 --> 00:07:09.326]  It's like you're in World War II!
[00:07:11.249 --> 00:07:14.092]  said Tom Hanks in a video yesterday.
[00:07:14.092 --> 00:07:16.234]  You all the heroes.
[00:07:16.234 --> 00:07:18.196]  Incredibly devastating.
[00:07:18.196 --> 00:07:30.908]  And as I've always said, if Hitler wore a pink uniform, he would have won World War II because people would have bowed down and said, somebody wearing pink is nothing but good.
[00:07:32.438 --> 00:07:35.119]  That's why Bill and Melinda Gates always wear pink in public.
[00:07:35.119 --> 00:07:46.141]  It's why Mark Zuckerberg's gotten rid of his characteristic gray or black t-shirt and he now wears pink sweaters under his mentor Bill Gates.
[00:07:46.141 --> 00:07:49.621]  And see, I'm wearing a pink sweater of your TV viewer.
[00:07:49.621 --> 00:07:53.142]  I'm wearing the Bill Gates uniform.
[00:07:53.142 --> 00:07:56.983]  So it doesn't matter I get up on TV and say I want to reduce the world population.
[00:07:58.404 --> 00:08:00.948]  Doesn't matter if I say I want death panels.
[00:08:00.948 --> 00:08:03.752]  Doesn't matter if I say I want more childhood death.
[00:08:03.752 --> 00:08:05.895]  Doesn't matter if I run Planned Parenthood.
[00:08:05.895 --> 00:08:10.562]  Doesn't matter if I've been caught sterilizing people all over the world.
[00:08:10.562 --> 00:08:12.525]  He's wearing a pink shirt!
[00:08:14.992 --> 00:08:17.774]  After all, we know anyone wearing a pink shirt's gotta be good.
[00:08:17.774 --> 00:08:24.498]  Warren Buffett more and more wears pink shirts and almost always poses with an ice cream cone.
[00:08:24.498 --> 00:08:25.159]  Look!
[00:08:25.159 --> 00:08:26.259]  Ice cream cone!
[00:08:26.259 --> 00:08:28.481]  And it's like, oh, ice cream!
[00:08:28.481 --> 00:08:29.682]  He's like a little boy.
[00:08:29.682 --> 00:08:31.923]  He's like a little child.
[00:08:31.923 --> 00:08:34.745]  He doesn't launder hundreds of billions in drug money.
[00:08:34.745 --> 00:08:36.606]  Got caught doing it in 2010.
[00:08:39.617 --> 00:08:46.618]  No, Warren Buffett wears pink and he has an ice cream cone.
[00:08:46.618 --> 00:08:49.539]  David Icke is going to be joining us in the third hour.
[00:08:49.539 --> 00:09:00.901]  He got massively censored and banned off the Internet for questioning COVID-19 and pointing out they're putting deaths from a bunch of other diseases in the same column in Europe, the U.S., in Canada, in Australia.
[00:09:00.901 --> 00:09:05.861]  It's all globally run by the standards of the WHO.
[00:09:05.861 --> 00:09:08.522]  And when San Antonio
[00:09:09.707 --> 00:09:14.730]  Passed a law last Thursday saying you'll be arrested if you say Chinese virus.
[00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:17.091]  They said because the W.H.O.
[00:09:17.091 --> 00:09:20.273]  says it doesn't come from China.
[00:09:20.273 --> 00:09:21.473]  And I guess the W.H.O.
[00:09:21.473 --> 00:09:23.714]  could say the moon is made of cheese.
[00:09:23.714 --> 00:09:28.297]  So, David Icke had his little nod to Bill Gates with his little pink shirt.
[00:09:28.297 --> 00:09:31.719]  Well, now I am wearing the pink shirt.
[00:09:31.719 --> 00:09:34.640]  Just to all show that we can be trusted.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:37.381]  Look, I'm wearing pink.
[00:09:37.381 --> 00:09:38.102]  Let's get serious.
[00:09:40.148 --> 00:09:51.839]  If you go back to the middle of January and we saw the buildings being locked down, people being welded into their homes, the drones, women being shot at checkpoints, and I came on there and I said, folks, the UN's running this.
[00:09:51.839 --> 00:09:54.041]  They're going to hype this here domestically.
[00:09:54.041 --> 00:10:00.908]  When Trump doesn't respond and tries to say it's a hoax, they're going to blame him and say every death is his fault.
[00:10:00.908 --> 00:10:04.191]  So Trump has to at least come out and take control of it.
[00:10:05.342 --> 00:10:07.222]  Or the NIH will be in complete control.
[00:10:07.222 --> 00:10:10.083]  The states and counties and blue cities will be in control.
[00:10:10.083 --> 00:10:16.605]  They'll create the precedent for total complete lockdown outside of the federal government's control.
[00:10:16.605 --> 00:10:27.827]  So Trump's got to jump in, take control of it to ride the tiger, and then at a proper time, come out and expose the fake numbers and try to turn the economy back on.
[00:10:27.827 --> 00:10:30.748]  Because the public wanted to buy into the hoax.
[00:10:30.748 --> 00:10:34.729]  They saw the science fiction dystopic images out of China, all choreographed.
[00:10:35.731 --> 00:10:37.992]  And now we know exactly what happened.
[00:10:37.992 --> 00:10:41.114]  We'll be breaking it all down today.
[00:10:41.114 --> 00:10:44.415]  But what's the real agenda behind COVID-19?
[00:10:44.415 --> 00:10:56.041]  Global cashless society surveilling everything you do, tied to the fact that you have been inoculated with a digital ink tattoo that Villamona Gates have patented under the skin.
[00:10:56.041 --> 00:11:05.106]  Now they've officially put out those patents, but the media will look at another patent they have for a bracelet, a watch, or a chip to track you in live time using wireless
[00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:11.892]  Patent 2020-06-06-06, and they'll go, oh, that's not a chip necessarily.
[00:11:11.892 --> 00:11:13.093]  It's fake news.
[00:11:13.093 --> 00:11:19.799]  Even though they have the other MIT push patent with Bill and Melinda Gates saying it's under the skin.
[00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:23.571]  That all got put to bed yesterday.
[00:11:23.571 --> 00:11:39.080]  Benjamin Netanyahu came out and said he has Shin Bet, the internal Israeli security force, looking at making every child in Israel take an implantable chip for COVID-19, of course, to make sure you stay separated.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.182]  That, by the way, is the Jerusalem Post.
[00:11:42.182 --> 00:11:48.086]  Benjamin Netanyahu suggests microchipping kids slammed by experts.
[00:11:48.086 --> 00:11:49.787]  Elion Musk says, put them in your brain.
[00:11:51.576 --> 00:11:55.037]  So that's where we are.
[00:11:55.037 --> 00:12:04.500]  Any excuse for COVID-19, and now you're locked down, you're a hero for not leaving your house in the UK, but 15,000 people a day fly in totally untested.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:18.943]  It's all complete theater training you that you are obsolete and that you are not essential for the robot takeover, the end of the carbon-based life form, the rise of the silicon life form, as all the top globalists say they believe is about to happen.
[00:12:18.943 --> 00:12:20.384]  But the big news when we come back
[00:12:21.388 --> 00:12:23.730]  It's much worse than you're being told.
[00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:28.132]  Very powerful article on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:28.132 --> 00:12:36.198]  Laying all of what's really going on out with the economy.
[00:12:36.198 --> 00:12:36.618]  U.S.
[00:12:36.618 --> 00:12:39.840]  risking a second wave and depression.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.542]  Mark Zandi says, that's right.
[00:12:42.542 --> 00:12:45.303]  The wave was tiny compared to what they said it would be.
[00:12:45.303 --> 00:12:48.846]  But now because they count all deaths as COVID-19, they're going to hype it up again.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.443]  At the end of the summer and say the lockdown can never stop or all of you not locking down our murderers.
[00:12:55.443 --> 00:13:03.368]  And then the hospitals will all have the testing kits now that test positive if you've ever had the flu or the coronavirus in the last decade.
[00:13:03.368 --> 00:13:05.790]  Coronavirus was common, cold virus there is.
[00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:07.411]  And so there'll be even more hysteria.
[00:13:09.676 --> 00:13:21.725]  And more finger-pointing and more mask-wearing, ensuring a long, dark depression they believe will remove President Trump, bankrupt the Western world, and put us fully under servitude like the Third World.
[00:13:21.725 --> 00:13:28.109]  That's why Bill Gates gets so excited when he was on with Fareed Zakaria when they talk about total economic collapse.
[00:13:28.109 --> 00:13:38.597]  Because this means with all their stolen wealth, when things collapse, they can buy everything up for pennies on the dollar and then exercise total control over the population.
[00:13:40.677 --> 00:13:44.718]  That's why now it's so essential for all of us to become self-sufficient.
[00:13:44.718 --> 00:14:02.781]  And the first thing you can do is learn how to use a firearm to protect yourself in a defensive way, and to learn some basic defense moves, and to have water filtration, air filtration, and high quality storable foods, all available, highest quality, ready to ship to you at infowarestore.com.
[00:14:02.781 --> 00:14:09.162]  And please don't forget, these aren't just great products you need that make your life better, that make you healthier.
[00:14:09.815 --> 00:14:21.305]  They also fund this operation, which is, as you can see, so important now that everybody else is getting censored and shut down unless they bend the knee to Bill Gates and say he's Lord and Savior, like Jack Posobiec's done.
[00:14:21.305 --> 00:14:25.529]  Unless you bow to the New World Order, you will be taken off the main internet.
[00:14:25.529 --> 00:14:28.772]  That's why we have Band.Video.
[00:14:28.772 --> 00:14:30.193]  That's why we have InfoWars.com.

[00:15:54.305 --> 00:15:54.885]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:56.536 --> 00:16:04.458]  Globalism is all about making the nation-state and the population itself obsolete, non-essential.
[00:16:04.458 --> 00:16:16.921]  That's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes, and controls to where family farms and industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate.
[00:16:16.921 --> 00:16:22.942]  That's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out,
[00:16:23.522 --> 00:16:27.825]  They can simply look at us and say, because again, you are not essential.
[00:16:27.825 --> 00:16:30.846]  That's what the robots and all of this is about.
[00:16:30.846 --> 00:16:35.009]  It's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives.
[00:16:35.009 --> 00:16:38.831]  We can be told to stay in our houses, and after all, shut up!
[00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:44.995]  This world doesn't belong to people anyways, it belongs to the new AI gods, the rich elitists that have merged with machines.
[00:16:44.995 --> 00:16:46.796]  Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[00:16:47.591 --> 00:16:50.713]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing.
[00:16:50.713 --> 00:16:59.498]  These people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[00:16:59.498 --> 00:17:02.100]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:17:22.242 --> 00:17:29.631]  Today, California braces as coronavirus numbers explode.
[00:17:29.631 --> 00:17:30.993]  Dreaded comeback.
[00:17:30.993 --> 00:17:40.284]  Wuhan reports five new coronavirus cases, its highest surge in two months.
[00:17:41.846 --> 00:17:45.228]  Coronavirus spread accelerates in Germany.
[00:17:45.228 --> 00:17:49.171]  Contagion within the White House would be catastrophic for U.S.
[00:17:49.171 --> 00:17:50.772]  national security.
[00:17:50.772 --> 00:17:57.197]  GOP senators worry Trump COVID-19 could cost them the majority.
[00:17:57.197 --> 00:18:03.722]  AP exclusive, doc show, top White House officials buried, CDC report.
[00:18:06.087 --> 00:18:13.492]  But depending on the graph, they're 50 to 10 times lower COVID-19 death rates than they predicted.
[00:18:13.492 --> 00:18:17.274]  And the very same groups now put out all these new fake numbers.
[00:18:17.274 --> 00:18:22.298]  And Trump's like, no, I'm not putting these numbers out predicting giant deaths and millions more cases.
[00:18:22.298 --> 00:18:25.840]  Because he goes, I don't trust your testing.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:26.540]  Because he knows.
[00:18:27.581 --> 00:18:37.323]  Biologists in Australia and Africa and other areas have tested people and found that these tests are all wrong, the way they're designed.
[00:18:37.323 --> 00:18:45.584]  That's why, quote, Fauci at the NIH, remember, three months ago, approved unapproved tests from China.
[00:18:45.584 --> 00:18:50.945]  Because they want everyone to be positive so they can test everyone dying.
[00:18:50.945 --> 00:18:55.166]  Look up the number, the average number of people that die daily on planet Earth.
[00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:57.190]  The estimate.
[00:18:57.190 --> 00:19:00.531]  Versus the average number that die every day in the United States.
[00:19:00.531 --> 00:19:01.592]  And they've got the graphs.
[00:19:01.592 --> 00:19:02.632]  Again, I keep harping on this.
[00:19:02.632 --> 00:19:11.155]  They move the dead that die of heart attacks and car wrecks and cancer and pneumonia over into the COVID column.
[00:19:11.155 --> 00:19:20.517]  And Berks admitted two months ago, and again a month ago, on the stand, on the stage, that they do that!
[00:19:20.517 --> 00:19:22.278]  This is conclusive.
[00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:31.674]  It's simply amazing.
[00:19:31.674 --> 00:19:38.099]  So the average number of deaths by world region.
[00:19:38.099 --> 00:19:39.460]  Wow.
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:44.284]  50 million deaths every year.
[00:19:44.284 --> 00:19:49.769]  And so I guess if they just, this is more than 50 million going up towards 60 million.
[00:19:49.769 --> 00:19:51.270]  I guess if they just count
[00:19:54.051 --> 00:19:55.032]  Everybody dying.
[00:19:55.032 --> 00:20:00.677]  Let's say 56 million people are going to die this year from COVID.
[00:20:00.677 --> 00:20:02.058]  That's fraction magic.
[00:20:02.058 --> 00:20:04.601]  That's statistic magic.
[00:20:04.601 --> 00:20:10.346]  But oh, I want to pull this article up from California Globe on April 14th.
[00:20:10.346 --> 00:20:14.490]  Experts significantly lower coronavirus death projections in California.
[00:20:16.004 --> 00:20:26.011]  So then they lower them down to nothing, and then now that it's, oh, going up a little higher than they thought, once they lowered it down, now they say it's exploding.
[00:20:26.011 --> 00:20:30.033]  So first they say it's gonna be 100 feet tall, and they go, oh, actually, it's gonna be a centimeter high.
[00:20:30.033 --> 00:20:31.734]  They go, oh, actually, it's two centimeters high.
[00:20:31.734 --> 00:20:38.899]  And they play those games with you and I every single day.
[00:20:38.899 --> 00:20:40.380]  But there are reports coming out
[00:20:42.571 --> 00:20:55.259]  That Dr. Fauci's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, NIAID, funded the Communist Chinese government and was the main funder of the Wuhan Virus Laboratory.
[00:20:55.259 --> 00:21:01.163]  We reported that, of course, three months ago, but now it's in AP, it's in Reuters, it's in Newsweek.
[00:21:01.163 --> 00:21:02.364]  But does it matter?
[00:21:02.364 --> 00:21:06.967]  When you tune into CNN or MSNBC, they say it's fake news.
[00:21:06.967 --> 00:21:09.629]  So the very people that stand to make all this money off of it,
[00:21:10.691 --> 00:21:20.034]  The very people that stand to control our lives, that admit they want to depopulate us, are the ones now wanting to put these things in our bodies.
[00:21:20.034 --> 00:21:23.174]  People go, oh, no, Bill Gates is a philanthropist.
[00:21:23.174 --> 00:21:31.557]  Yeah, 20-something years ago, he put his $100-plus billion into a tax-free foundation with Warren and Buffett, so his companies all run profits.
[00:21:31.557 --> 00:21:35.598]  He keeps the profits and then only gives maybe 1% a year
[00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:45.852]  of the money into, quote, charity, which is sterilizing people and controlling the population.
[00:21:45.852 --> 00:21:54.061]  Here's a few clips of Bill Gates talking about childhood death and depopulation.
[00:21:54.061 --> 00:21:57.724]  And of course, we have clips of him talking about death panels, get rid of old people.
[00:21:57.724 --> 00:21:59.106]  Here's some of the things he said recently.
[00:21:59.923 --> 00:22:07.491]  It's a chance for us to share things like reducing childhood death and improving the nutrition.
[00:22:07.491 --> 00:22:11.034]  So it's a chance to travel to Africa, meet with scientists.
[00:22:11.034 --> 00:22:14.578]  We see a lot of things that are going very well.
[00:22:14.578 --> 00:22:19.603]  Things like reducing childhood death and improving the nutrition.
[00:22:19.603 --> 00:22:22.166]  So travel to Africa, meet with scientists.
[00:22:22.166 --> 00:22:23.006]  We see a lot of things
[00:22:23.787 --> 00:22:25.508]  Uh, that are going very well.
[00:22:25.508 --> 00:22:30.711]  Uh, things like reducing childhood death and, uh, improving the nutrition.
[00:22:30.711 --> 00:22:31.952]  So, it's a chance.
[00:22:31.952 --> 00:22:33.953]  Travel to Africa, meet with scientists.
[00:22:33.953 --> 00:22:37.335]  We see a lot of things, uh, that are going very well.
[00:22:37.335 --> 00:22:42.638]  Uh, things like reducing childhood death and... Uh, things like reducing childhood death and...
[00:22:42.938 --> 00:22:45.661]  The economy is not going to be anything like it was.
[00:22:45.661 --> 00:22:47.803]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[00:22:47.803 --> 00:22:52.647]  It's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful this is.
[00:22:52.647 --> 00:22:58.673]  Let's watch that video one more time where Bill Gates becomes visibly
[00:22:59.714 --> 00:23:12.603]  Joyful, excited, almost having an orgasm when Fareed Zarkaria, the other fellow globalist of the Bilderberg Group, on CNN talks about how horrible the economy is and how we better get used to it.
[00:23:12.603 --> 00:23:15.385]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[00:23:15.385 --> 00:23:21.309]  It's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how fruitful this is.
[00:23:21.869 --> 00:23:24.110]  In the video Gates gets more excited.
[00:23:24.110 --> 00:23:51.060]  Here we clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they're most at risk of that and doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people and yet you don't have side effects you know if we have you know one in 10,000 side effects that's you know way more 700,000 you know people who will suffer from that so
[00:23:51.821 --> 00:24:04.930]  Really understanding the safety at gigantic scale across all age ranges, you know, pregnant, male, female, undernourished, existing comorbidities, it's very, very hard.
[00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:19.600]  And that actual decision of, okay, let's go and give this vaccine to the entire world, governments will have to be involved because there will be some risk and indemnification needed before that can be decided on.
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:34.541]  Well, Bill, since you tried to warn us about this pandemic and we didn't listen, what's the next thing you're warning us about that's going to happen five years from now that we're not listening to at the present?
[00:24:35.745 --> 00:24:38.909]  Well, I didn't want to be right.
[00:24:38.909 --> 00:24:41.211]  What I wanted to do was run the investments.
[00:24:41.211 --> 00:24:41.792]  I understand.
[00:24:41.792 --> 00:24:43.174]  I'm not saying you won.
[00:24:43.174 --> 00:24:44.095]  Everybody loses.
[00:24:44.095 --> 00:24:44.916]  Nobody wins with this.
[00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:48.139]  And I'm not saying that this is not an end zone dance.
[00:24:48.139 --> 00:24:53.145]  I'm just saying, what else are we not listening to that we need to take action on now?
[00:24:56.482 --> 00:25:04.305]  The idea of a bioterrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario because there, a pathogen with a high death rate would be picked.
[00:25:04.305 --> 00:25:08.667]  Now the good news is, not getting into depression is tough enough right now.
[00:25:08.667 --> 00:25:09.808]  Too late!
[00:25:09.808 --> 00:25:22.553]  Most of the work we're going to do to be ready for Pandemic 2, I call this Pandemic 1, most of the work we'll do to be ready for that are also the things we need to do to minimize the threat of
[00:25:22.813 --> 00:25:23.734]  Let's stop right there.
[00:25:23.734 --> 00:25:26.116]  Folks, it's all in Event 201.
[00:25:26.116 --> 00:25:28.458]  It's all in lockstep, the Rockefeller Foundation.
[00:25:28.458 --> 00:25:35.024]  This is just putting the handcuffs on you and locking you down and getting you ready for the national ID, the global ID, the implantable chip.
[00:25:35.024 --> 00:25:45.093]  Then the terrorists strike, but thank God Bill Gates is there to make sure you take the next shot that lowers your immunity even more so that the next binary weapon they release does kill you and your family.
[00:25:45.093 --> 00:25:45.773]  And that is his plan.
[00:25:46.854 --> 00:25:51.599]  And they'll probably kill me or put me in prison for doing this, but I'm telling the truth, so you know who killed you at least.
[00:25:51.599 --> 00:25:53.601]  Once you're dying, just remember who did it to you, okay?
[00:25:53.601 --> 00:25:54.281]  Alright, thanks.
[00:25:54.281 --> 00:25:58.866]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history.
[00:25:58.866 --> 00:26:01.828]  The globalists have taken the gloves off, and they've taken the mask off.
[00:26:01.828 --> 00:26:05.051]  And they're like, yeah, you're taking implantable chips.
[00:26:05.051 --> 00:26:06.833]  Yeah, we're into pedophilia.
[00:26:06.833 --> 00:26:08.615]  Yeah, we're into world government.
[00:26:08.615 --> 00:26:10.476]  Yeah, you're obsolete.
[00:26:10.476 --> 00:26:11.537]  You are non-essential.
[00:26:12.498 --> 00:26:14.320]  We are shutting your ass down.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:19.164]  Yeah, we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore.
[00:26:19.164 --> 00:26:20.845]  You're going to be the service economy.
[00:26:20.845 --> 00:26:26.209]  And now the globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy and you're obsolete.
[00:26:26.209 --> 00:26:31.354]  So you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance income so they can dictate your life.
[00:26:31.934 --> 00:26:34.535]  The handcuffs are going on right now.
[00:26:34.535 --> 00:26:37.217]  We have to resist and say no to the New World Order.
[00:26:37.217 --> 00:26:39.898]  And that takes you understanding you were right.
[00:26:39.898 --> 00:26:41.399]  And understanding I was right.
[00:26:41.399 --> 00:26:46.142]  And getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can.
[00:26:46.142 --> 00:26:47.943]  Now is the time for action.
[00:26:47.943 --> 00:26:49.744]  Now is the time for you to shine.
[00:26:49.744 --> 00:26:51.745]  And be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[00:26:54.161 --> 00:26:59.565]  One of the best nutrients nature has provided, beetroot, has been used for hundreds of years in natural medicine.

[00:27:57.246 --> 00:28:05.034]  And within a week or so, many of the best-selling items that we're selling at InfoWareStore.com will no longer be at 50% off.
[00:28:05.034 --> 00:28:11.682]  In fact, last year I said I can't do 50% off anymore because our markup just isn't enough for us to be able to get enough profit to operate this operation.
[00:28:12.162 --> 00:28:15.244]  But I want you to get the Ultimate Krill Oil.

[00:28:29.973 --> 00:28:42.221]  More than 20 items are 50% off right now, but we're going to have to end the sale on most items in about a week, because a lot of the products are getting close to selling out, like Real Redfield, Real Redfield Plus, and Azo Beats.

[00:28:57.302 --> 00:29:07.273]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:29:07.273 --> 00:29:18.625]  Say allegiance to the flag, whatever flag they offer.
[00:29:36.244 --> 00:29:42.428]  Well, there's a new article that just went live at newswars.com and infowars.com by Ron Paul.
[00:29:42.428 --> 00:29:48.191]  Ron Paul, authoritarians using coronavirus fear to destroy America.
[00:29:48.191 --> 00:29:53.955]  His next article will be, the sky is blue at high noon in Arizona.
[00:29:53.955 --> 00:29:55.015]  Yes, it's all true.
[00:29:55.015 --> 00:30:00.739]  Another key report, President Trump's betting on you needs to be seen, needs to be shared.
[00:30:00.739 --> 00:30:02.600]  Only way the dog hunts is you take action.
[00:30:03.612 --> 00:30:07.955]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us for the rest of the hour with Summit.News.
[00:30:07.955 --> 00:30:23.586]  Wanted to get Paul on because we see the UK flying in 15,000 people a day with no virus testing, including travelers from China, Italy, and the US, three of the supposedly hardest hit areas.
[00:30:23.586 --> 00:30:26.629]  But then you're not supposed to leave your houses.
[00:30:26.629 --> 00:30:29.270]  He wrote another article for InfoWars.com.
[00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.493]  Thousands of people are dying at home due to the lockdown.
[00:30:34.346 --> 00:30:38.260]  Meanwhile, Poll finds that 9 out of 10 in the UK want lockdown to carry on.
[00:30:40.026 --> 00:30:55.215]  We'll be looking at those reports with Paul Joseph Watson and ask where he thinks this is going because we see numbers out of the UK at least 20 times, 30 times, depending on the study, lower than what they said the death rate would be.
[00:30:55.215 --> 00:30:57.137]  Same thing in Canada.
[00:30:57.137 --> 00:30:58.137]  Same thing in the US.
[00:30:58.137 --> 00:30:59.058]  Same thing in Australia.
[00:30:59.058 --> 00:31:00.259]  Same thing in Germany.
[00:31:00.259 --> 00:31:04.501]  But they call it explosions in cases!
[00:31:04.501 --> 00:31:06.302]  Five new coronavirus cases!
[00:31:07.763 --> 00:31:13.251]  In Wuhan, the most deadly in months, it's the end of the world!
[00:31:13.251 --> 00:31:16.516]  Coronavirus spreads in Germany and accelerates.
[00:31:16.516 --> 00:31:18.638]  No, the truth is, they're counting all the deaths.
[00:31:20.148 --> 00:31:21.749]  from other things as COVID-19.
[00:31:21.749 --> 00:31:23.309]  They admit the tests are fake.
[00:31:23.309 --> 00:31:31.712]  A major biologist, the President of Tanzania, sent off a papaya and a goat to the National Testing Lab run by the UN, and they found it had coronavirus.
[00:31:31.712 --> 00:31:34.553]  So now we know it's about shutting down the West.
[00:31:34.553 --> 00:31:36.234]  It's about making sure we lose that trade war.
[00:31:36.234 --> 00:31:38.475]  It's about bringing in the national and global IDs.
[00:31:38.475 --> 00:31:40.316]  It's about the forced inoculations.
[00:31:40.316 --> 00:31:44.077]  Netanyahu proposes implantable chips for all the Israeli children.
[00:31:44.077 --> 00:31:45.177]  This is the dam breaking.
[00:31:45.177 --> 00:31:46.818]  This is the globalist takeover.
[00:31:46.818 --> 00:31:48.899]  Paul Joseph Watson from London
[00:31:49.799 --> 00:31:58.085]  Describe what it's like to be in the month number two of the lockdown and the Tom Hanks and others are describing it like winning World War Two.
[00:31:58.085 --> 00:32:00.907]  Everyone's heroes for staying in their houses.
[00:32:00.907 --> 00:32:07.112]  Is this true that nine out of ten folks in the UK want to want to stay locked in their houses, buried alive?
[00:32:09.059 --> 00:32:10.220]  Yes, it's true.
[00:32:10.220 --> 00:32:15.946]  According to the polls, Alex, vast support for the lockdown to continue even beyond July.
[00:32:15.946 --> 00:32:21.171]  And I bet if you ask a lot of these people, they probably just want it to continue permanently, Alex.
[00:32:21.171 --> 00:32:24.395]  Mainly because they're getting paid by the government.
[00:32:24.395 --> 00:32:27.618]  This is like an insight into what universal basic income might be.
[00:32:28.263 --> 00:32:41.131]  They're happy to take 80% of their payment from the government to stay at home, to sit on their backsides and do nothing, even though there's probably not going to be much of an economy to come back to, and even though this whole thing
[00:32:41.957 --> 00:32:45.279]  is costing more lives than it is saving.
[00:32:45.279 --> 00:32:50.021]  We were told that we had to endure this lockdown Alex, which by the way I supported at the start.
[00:32:50.021 --> 00:32:53.783]  I could see the sense in limited lockdown for a short period of time.
[00:32:53.783 --> 00:32:59.325]  We were told we needed to do it to stay at home, save lives and protect the NHS.
[00:32:59.325 --> 00:33:11.191]  Okay, the NHS, National Health Service, the overspill hospitals they built to deal with the coronavirus because they thought and they told us the hospitals would be completely overwhelmed like they were in Italy.
[00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:14.211]  Half of them didn't even open.
[00:33:14.211 --> 00:33:16.233]  They're closing down the remaining ones.
[00:33:16.233 --> 00:33:21.917]  Acute hospital beds across the United Kingdom are four times emptier than normal.
[00:33:21.917 --> 00:33:22.977]  And why is that?
[00:33:22.977 --> 00:33:30.462]  Because many of the people who are staying at home are cancer victims, heart attack victims and stroke victims.
[00:33:30.462 --> 00:33:32.584]  And you mentioned the article which we put out today.
[00:33:33.965 --> 00:33:45.680]  At least 10,000 excess deaths already due to people staying at home and not going into hospital for treatment, either because the treatment's not available or because they're scared of the coronavirus.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:51.527]  You have cancer experts, the professor of cancer at King's College University, Richard Sullivan,
[00:33:52.262 --> 00:33:59.547]  Saying there will be more excess cancer deaths than total coronavirus deaths across the United Kingdom.
[00:33:59.547 --> 00:34:12.515]  And in fact, an NHS consultant, Professor Carol Sikora, has said that there will be 50,000 excess deaths from cancer as a result of screenings being suspended in the UK.
[00:34:12.515 --> 00:34:19.259]  Let's bear in mind, Alex, around, I think it's the latest numbers, about 32,000 Covid deaths in the UK.
[00:34:19.259 --> 00:34:20.300]  But as you said, we know
[00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:31.013]  The vast majority of those deaths are people with severe debilitating diseases, illnesses, who, tragically enough, would have died anyway.
[00:34:31.013 --> 00:34:35.235]  But they're all counted as COVID deaths, because it's a similar situation in America.
[00:34:35.876 --> 00:34:42.098]  Where the doctors actually get increased promises of funding if they count the death as a COVID death.
[00:34:42.098 --> 00:34:45.819]  So you've got 50,000 excess cancer deaths.
[00:34:45.819 --> 00:34:50.700]  You've already got 10,000 deaths so far, just in the past six weeks alone.
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:35:04.124]  Because people who have strokes and heart attacks, when they do call an ambulance, they're waiting an hour, two hours, even three hours sometimes, because of the supposed focus on coronavirus, even though hospitals are half empty.
[00:35:04.124 --> 00:35:05.024]  Then you have the TV.
[00:35:06.167 --> 00:35:09.008]  And we wrote about this last week.
[00:35:09.008 --> 00:35:17.672]  1.4 million people, Alex, this is globally, are going to die according to TB experts from tuberculosis.
[00:35:17.672 --> 00:35:21.214]  1.4 million because they couldn't get hospital treatment.
[00:35:21.767 --> 00:35:33.062]  So the current global coronavirus death figure is the official figure anyway, and again, this is people, many of them died with debilitating diseases that were more of a factor than coronavirus, is 280,000.
[00:35:33.062 --> 00:35:34.444]  So even if that were to double
[00:35:37.307 --> 00:35:46.910]  Total global coronavirus deaths, that would still only represent one third of total TB deaths caused by these lockdowns.
[00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:56.933]  We were told to lock down to save lives, yet the very process of doing that is going to cause the loss of significantly more lives.
[00:35:56.933 --> 00:35:58.173]  So what was the point Alex?
[00:36:00.148 --> 00:36:07.175]  Well, Paul, I'm not putting you on the spot because a lot of times you've been right and I've been wrong on, let's say, four or five big subjects.
[00:36:07.175 --> 00:36:09.097]  So I really respect you.
[00:36:09.097 --> 00:36:14.102]  But you remember two and a half months ago, you're like, Alex, come on, the hospitals aren't empty.
[00:36:14.102 --> 00:36:15.564]  You better watch running these stories.
[00:36:15.564 --> 00:36:17.726]  And I said, no, these are real people going out there.
[00:36:17.726 --> 00:36:18.847]  I know it was hard to believe.
[00:36:18.847 --> 00:36:20.048]  Now they admit that's true.
[00:36:21.129 --> 00:36:26.352]  Project Veritas has caught them staging actors going in, caught them staging lines of cars.
[00:36:26.352 --> 00:36:29.094]  I know that's hard to believe, but they now admit they did it.
[00:36:29.094 --> 00:36:30.434]  They got caught.
[00:36:30.434 --> 00:36:38.639]  And so this whole thing had to be premeditated through the WHO as the authority, through the National Health Service, through the NIH, through all the National Health Boards.
[00:36:39.870 --> 00:36:47.412]  And it's all been concerted to hype it up, to not open the economy, to tell us only two weeks so the hospitals don't get overwhelmed.
[00:36:47.412 --> 00:36:52.233]  Then we're told, oh actually two months, two years, it never ends.
[00:36:52.233 --> 00:36:54.174]  And so the handcuffs were put on us.
[00:36:54.174 --> 00:36:55.514]  We were set up.
[00:36:55.514 --> 00:36:57.975]  I wasn't sure three months ago how deadly it really was.
[00:36:59.035 --> 00:37:02.018]  And so I was saying, hey, we better get ready because it looks really bad.
[00:37:02.018 --> 00:37:06.701]  But it looks like they may use it as a way to lock down and then blame Trump and then try to throw him out of office.
[00:37:06.701 --> 00:37:09.623]  Well, now the Democrats admit that's their whole way of running.
[00:37:09.623 --> 00:37:13.947]  Now, you can say, well, it's don't let a good crisis go to waste, like Hillary said about COVID-19.
[00:37:13.947 --> 00:37:16.709]  Regardless, they're using it to keep things locked down.
[00:37:16.709 --> 00:37:18.570]  They're using it for a total takeover.
[00:37:18.570 --> 00:37:20.272]  What do you think's really behind this whole thing?
[00:37:22.085 --> 00:37:43.982]  I think it's creating the precedent to have these powers become permanent, where the government says jump and you say how high, which is why yesterday, during Boris Johnson's announcement, he's introduced this kind of George W. Bush-style colour-coded alert level system, and they say if it ticks above 2, then we have to re-impose these measures.
[00:37:43.982 --> 00:37:48.406]  So of course that makes it, that colour-coded alert is now going to become permanent.
[00:37:49.022 --> 00:37:53.625]  So they can lower it, they can raise it, whenever they want people to start obeying.
[00:37:53.625 --> 00:37:54.866]  And think of the perfect plan.
[00:37:54.866 --> 00:37:58.108]  This is martial law, click of a button, flip of a switch.
[00:37:58.108 --> 00:38:01.750]  You just, whenever you want, you just say, oh, there's a deadly virus or there's a problem.
[00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:02.610]  Stay in your homes.
[00:38:02.610 --> 00:38:06.953]  And all of a sudden, out of a Black Mirror episode, here are the robots enforcing it.
[00:38:08.601 --> 00:38:19.005]  Yeah, which of course gives the government de facto permission to criminalise any protest whatsoever by declaring a coronavirus alert in the few days before.
[00:38:19.005 --> 00:38:24.467]  And even if the current government is not going to abuse that power, an infinite number of future governments could.
[00:38:25.007 --> 00:38:31.272]  Meanwhile, you have people, Alex, literally clapping, you know, obeying, worshipping the NHS every Thursday at 8 p.m.
[00:38:31.272 --> 00:38:35.656]  Then they all go out and cram the parks and violate social distancing.
[00:38:35.656 --> 00:38:37.437]  It's complete hypocrisy.
[00:38:37.437 --> 00:38:42.020]  They're doing it for social media clout just with the, like, the dancing TikTok nurses.
[00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:44.222]  We're going to show all that video when we come back.
[00:38:44.222 --> 00:38:51.308]  And your robot enforcers and babies being ripped out of women's arms from Germany to Australia when they dare leave their houses without authorization.
[00:38:51.308 --> 00:38:52.849]  But all the bureaucrats, they do whatever they want.
[00:38:53.484 --> 00:38:55.848]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[00:38:55.848 --> 00:38:56.429]  They're amazing.
[00:38:56.429 --> 00:38:57.111]  They're cutting edge.
[00:38:57.111 --> 00:38:57.531]  You love them.
[00:38:57.531 --> 00:38:58.173]  I love them.
[00:38:58.173 --> 00:39:01.819]  And they fund the InfoWars in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[00:39:01.819 --> 00:39:05.766]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development.
[00:39:06.932 --> 00:39:08.573]  That is amazing.
[00:39:08.573 --> 00:39:16.236]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[00:39:16.236 --> 00:39:18.557]  And there's another innovation.
[00:39:18.557 --> 00:39:20.657]  It's the spray cap.
[00:39:20.657 --> 00:39:26.060]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality.
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:28.240]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.141]  I like to put it on my hands.
[00:39:29.901 --> 00:39:31.403]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[00:39:31.403 --> 00:39:34.226]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so don't spray it right in your eyes.
[00:39:34.226 --> 00:39:38.610]  But I just love it, personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:40.412]  So, this is a real innovation.
[00:39:40.412 --> 00:39:46.798]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out.
[00:39:46.798 --> 00:39:48.300]  It smells great.
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:50.122]  It's so refreshing.
[00:39:50.122 --> 00:39:50.983]  This is a big winner.
[00:39:53.416 --> 00:40:04.404]  I was talking to my wife tonight and I was saying our economy slowing down and shutting down is like shooting a deer and it runs 100 yards before it knows it's been shot and then it finally dies.
[00:40:04.404 --> 00:40:11.610]  She said, well yeah, when I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, one time there was an argument in the street and another man shot another man in the head.
[00:40:12.330 --> 00:40:22.657]  And the man that got shot in the head had blood pouring out of a huge hole, and he was holding it, and he walked around gibbering, talking nonsense for about 60 seconds, and then just fell over dead.
[00:40:22.657 --> 00:40:25.219]  Well, that's what's going to happen with our economy.
[00:40:25.219 --> 00:40:27.200]  It is in cardiac arrest.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:34.865]  This has been done by design, and the UN, the CHICOMS, the mainstream media orchestrated it, hyped it, and tried to keep the economy closed.
[00:40:35.425 --> 00:40:46.270]  So remember, the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on the UN, on Bill and Melinda Gates, on Obama, on Hillary, on Biden, on the Democrats.
[00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:52.353]  We tried to stop it, we tried to fight it, but you guys said you wanted to wreck America and the world and now you've done it.
[00:40:52.353 --> 00:40:53.073]  Congratulations.
[00:40:54.508 --> 00:41:00.852]  I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen to a song and telling you all these horrible things.
[00:41:00.852 --> 00:41:04.975]  But you notice, almost everything we've talked about, horrible, has come true.
[00:41:04.975 --> 00:41:08.797]  We were warning everybody to try to stop it.
[00:41:08.797 --> 00:41:16.202]  It's like telling somebody if you got a pool, put a fence around it if you have little kids, because even if they're good swimmers, they can hit their head and drown.
[00:41:16.202 --> 00:41:18.524]  People don't listen, they go out and their kid's dead in the pool.
[00:41:19.204 --> 00:41:23.487]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the death of the third world and the collapse of the first world.
[00:41:23.487 --> 00:41:27.330]  And this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalists.
[00:41:27.330 --> 00:41:29.931]  And they admit they've orchestrated it.
[00:41:29.931 --> 00:41:32.413]  They admit it's, quote, good to save the Earth.
[00:41:32.413 --> 00:41:34.354]  And they're teaching us to be more frugal.
[00:41:34.354 --> 00:41:39.298]  And they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy.
[00:41:39.978 --> 00:41:47.445]  I know all this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public because it's their operations manual.
[00:41:47.445 --> 00:41:53.531]  I wish this wasn't the case, but there really are evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions and we've got to stop them.
[00:41:54.588 --> 00:42:01.191]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy to where it is.
[00:42:01.191 --> 00:42:17.118]  Every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months, it is going to be a death sentence to the third world, and a horrible, nightmarish collapse for the first world, and that the general public is going to go into deep, deep debt to the megabanks.
[00:42:17.118 --> 00:42:20.399]  They're not going to have medical ID cards, forced inoculations.
[00:42:20.399 --> 00:42:23.681]  We are now in a giant dystopia.
[00:42:24.241 --> 00:42:43.236]  But a lot of people are waking up, and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny, and we must all rediscover our Bill of Rights, rediscover our Constitution and our backbone, and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say, shut your business down, shut your life down, it'll save lives.
[00:42:43.236 --> 00:42:43.757]  No.
[00:42:43.757 --> 00:42:47.840]  It's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions more.
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:52.704]  So the cowards who went along with this with your virtue signaling, you have destroyed your lives and our lives.
[00:42:52.704 --> 00:42:53.565]  Congratulations.
[00:42:57.290 --> 00:43:15.678]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:43:15.678 --> 00:43:16.138]  Welcome back.
[00:43:16.138 --> 00:43:16.698]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:43:16.698 --> 00:43:19.860]  Your host, Paul Joseph Watson of Summit.News is our guest here today.
[00:43:20.816 --> 00:43:33.590]  And I'm sure you've seen the countless videos of police officers beating up innocent citizens that are out on the streets of Germany or New York City in the United States or Sydney, Australia.
[00:43:33.590 --> 00:43:37.554]  Meanwhile, PA sheriffs refuse to enforce business shutdown.
[00:43:37.554 --> 00:43:40.097]  They say all businesses are essential.
[00:43:40.097 --> 00:43:41.779]  How can only big box stores stay open?
[00:43:42.807 --> 00:43:45.487]  But let's go ahead and roll footage with the audio.
[00:43:45.487 --> 00:43:50.928]  Australian police rip terrified child from mother for protesting lockdown.
[00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:57.409]  I guess Australia, a lot of great people, but it always was a prisoner colony.
[00:43:57.409 --> 00:44:02.770]  Kind of like Hawaii is a beautiful state, but it's still under martial law.
[00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:05.171]  That's why they're totally locked down.
[00:44:05.171 --> 00:44:06.371]  This is totally sick.
[00:44:06.371 --> 00:44:07.811]  Of course, the police aren't wearing masks.
[00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:11.712]  They all know it's a fraud, but they follow their illegal orders.
[00:44:11.712 --> 00:44:12.312]  Here's that video.
[00:44:16.877 --> 00:44:18.579]  The police aren't wearing masks either.
[00:44:18.579 --> 00:44:18.999]  They're God.
[00:44:18.999 --> 00:44:20.401]  Screaming mother with her child.
[00:44:20.401 --> 00:44:21.882]  Being on the streets.
[00:44:21.882 --> 00:44:22.423]  Disappearing.
[00:44:39.644 --> 00:44:41.905]  With the child getting used to these images.
[00:44:41.905 --> 00:44:50.049]  This was all premeditated.
[00:44:50.049 --> 00:45:00.955]  The Rockefeller Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, they all said they'd use a global pandemic to bring in the Cashless Society, the surveillance, the forced inoculations, and it's here!
[00:45:00.955 --> 00:45:02.736]  So it is on purpose, it is by design.
[00:45:03.646 --> 00:45:05.626]  And you know, I'm not attacking Jack Posobiec.
[00:45:05.626 --> 00:45:09.227]  He's a smart guy, and I like Jack.
[00:45:09.227 --> 00:45:11.388]  But he put out this tweet.
[00:45:11.388 --> 00:45:12.308]  He's put out a bunch of these.
[00:45:12.308 --> 00:45:17.189]  And so when I make a film about this, which we're making very, very quickly, this is going to be part of the film.
[00:45:17.189 --> 00:45:23.111]  To be clear, COVID-19 is not a deep state Soros-Bill Gates population control conspiracy.
[00:45:23.111 --> 00:45:25.151]  Oh, the CIA termed conspiracy theory.
[00:45:25.151 --> 00:45:28.052]  There is no evidence of this whatsoever.
[00:45:28.052 --> 00:45:33.173]  It is a virus, a terrible global virus that, jeez, China tried to cover up.
[00:45:34.991 --> 00:45:36.452]  Well, I mean, they admit it came out of Wuhan.
[00:45:36.452 --> 00:45:37.532]  I reported that three months ago.
[00:45:37.532 --> 00:45:43.235]  I broke it all, but we're being told that there just is no proof authoritatively.
[00:45:43.235 --> 00:45:46.477]  Just stated, like the great and powerful laws.
[00:45:46.477 --> 00:45:51.399]  Well, this is going to be what we disprove in the film right here.
[00:45:51.399 --> 00:45:55.641]  And all the other mainstream media dutifully telling us that he's not even connected to Wuhan.
[00:45:55.641 --> 00:45:56.462]  Neither is Fauci.
[00:45:56.462 --> 00:45:57.983]  It's all a conspiracy.
[00:45:57.983 --> 00:45:58.783]  Don't look into that.
[00:45:58.783 --> 00:45:59.683]  Don't look into Fauci.
[00:45:59.683 --> 00:46:01.925]  Don't look into Fauci.
[00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:04.246]  Don't look into Fauci or we're going to put your ass in prison, Jones.
[00:46:05.182 --> 00:46:05.662]  Go ahead.
[00:46:05.662 --> 00:46:11.088]  I'm worried about God, not you.
[00:46:11.088 --> 00:46:15.392]  Paul Joseph Watson, I have the article here, U.S.
[00:46:15.392 --> 00:46:20.817]  risking a second wave and a depression, Mark Zandi says, of Moody's.
[00:46:20.817 --> 00:46:22.838]  And he says if we don't stay locked down,
[00:46:24.070 --> 00:46:27.312]  There'll be mass death, and then the economy will have a depression.
[00:46:27.312 --> 00:46:35.598]  But these very same people continue that are telling us, stay locked down or we're all dead, are the ones that we keep learning or betting against the stock market, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:46:35.598 --> 00:46:36.799]  It's simple math.
[00:46:36.799 --> 00:46:39.461]  You stay locked down, we have a global depression.
[00:46:39.461 --> 00:46:41.362]  You open up, we don't have a depression.
[00:46:41.362 --> 00:46:43.724]  Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:46:43.724 --> 00:46:51.990]  Yeah, this whole second wave fear-mongering is based on the R-rate, which is the rate of reinfection, the rate of infection for coronavirus.
[00:46:52.765 --> 00:47:00.069]  No government knows the R-rate because nobody knows how many people in any given country are infected with coronavirus.
[00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:09.153]  So the UK's entire model, which is when they say, when the R-rate gets above one, then we can reimpose lockdown.
[00:47:09.153 --> 00:47:11.554]  They don't know what the R-rate is.
[00:47:11.554 --> 00:47:12.675]  It's speculative.
[00:47:12.675 --> 00:47:17.177]  It's complete speculation because they don't know how many people are infected with the virus.
[00:47:17.617 --> 00:47:25.204]  So their entire strategy of, oh, if there's a second wave, if the R number goes back above one, we have to reimpose these measures.
[00:47:25.204 --> 00:47:27.506]  Nobody knows what that figure is.
[00:47:27.506 --> 00:47:28.828]  So again, it's complete BS.
[00:47:28.828 --> 00:47:35.994]  And then you look at Sweden, Alex, you look at Japan, you look at Belarus, countries which did not impose lockdowns.
[00:47:35.994 --> 00:47:36.495]  Sweden,
[00:47:37.364 --> 00:47:49.211]  Now has largely herd immunity without having to destroy their economy, without tens of thousands of potential cancer victims not getting treatment, without stroke heart attack victims not getting treatment.
[00:47:49.211 --> 00:47:51.052]  They did not impose a lockdown.
[00:47:51.052 --> 00:47:54.674]  They have a lower death rate per capita than the UK.
[00:47:54.674 --> 00:47:58.716]  They have a lower RA infection rate compared to the UK.
[00:47:58.716 --> 00:47:59.757]  You can look at Japan.
[00:48:00.416 --> 00:48:06.222]  Population 126 million compared to the UK's population which is 66 million.
[00:48:06.222 --> 00:48:08.805]  We've had 32,000 COVID deaths.
[00:48:08.805 --> 00:48:10.166]  They've had 624.
[00:48:10.166 --> 00:48:14.851]  They had international air traffic coming in just as we did.
[00:48:14.851 --> 00:48:16.933]  They didn't lock down.
[00:48:16.933 --> 00:48:17.314]  So again,
[00:48:18.052 --> 00:48:29.922]  New studies now coming out, Alex, show that this social distancing, that you have to be in extremely close proximity with somebody for an extended period of time to have the virus be transmitted.
[00:48:29.922 --> 00:48:38.909]  Studies showing that social distancing had no impact on the rates of deaths, the rates of infections, yet they haven't updated the science.
[00:48:38.909 --> 00:48:47.596]  Our entire model in the UK was based on this prediction by Professor Neil Ferguson, Imperial College, that half a million people would die
[00:48:48.231 --> 00:48:57.416]  This same guy's predictions for foot and mouth disease, for SARS, for all these other epidemics, were used by UK governments going back 10-15 years.
[00:48:57.416 --> 00:48:59.978]  They were all spectacularly wrong.
[00:48:59.978 --> 00:49:06.922]  Yet this is the guy, the authority that has been used for the model, not only for the UK, but for countries like South Africa.
[00:49:07.422 --> 00:49:09.202]  We had the article last week.
[00:49:09.202 --> 00:49:17.004]  Experts now say the lockdown will cause 29 times more deaths than coronavirus in South Africa.
[00:49:17.004 --> 00:49:23.886]  Based on this debunked, ridiculous model from a guy who's been spectacularly wrong time and time again.
[00:49:23.886 --> 00:49:32.448]  The same guy, by the way, who violated his own lockdown to have his married mistress, mother of two, come visit him for some hanky-panky.
[00:49:32.948 --> 00:49:37.591]  So he took it that seriously that he broke it himself at the first opportunity.
[00:49:37.591 --> 00:49:41.314]  Absolutely incredible.
[00:49:41.314 --> 00:49:45.156]  Paul, again, I've got all the graphs here.
[00:49:45.156 --> 00:49:51.660]  California had one twentieth or less the number of deaths they projected.
[00:49:51.660 --> 00:49:55.603]  But they have headlines out, California worse than expected.
[00:49:55.603 --> 00:49:58.765]  California level spike.
[00:49:58.765 --> 00:50:00.226]  And it's just totally made up.
[00:50:01.206 --> 00:50:05.089]  The graph was way up here, now it's way down here because there's a tiny little bump.
[00:50:05.089 --> 00:50:07.512]  They go, oh look!
[00:50:07.512 --> 00:50:20.203]  It'd be like if you had a weatherman out in the Mojave Desert, and there's no clouds in the sky, and he's on the news saying, tomorrow we're going to have 20 inches of rain and giant thunderstorms for a month.
[00:50:20.203 --> 00:50:25.747]  You have a month of no precipitation, totally blue skies, and still the weatherman's on
[00:50:26.806 --> 00:50:30.030]  But the weatherman tells you don't leave your house because of the floods.
[00:50:30.030 --> 00:50:31.411]  So everybody's staying in their houses.
[00:50:31.411 --> 00:50:33.393]  You look outside, it's sunny.
[00:50:33.393 --> 00:50:38.239]  But nobody goes out because the weatherman says there's tornadoes and floods and Noah's Ark.
[00:50:38.239 --> 00:50:40.361]  That's the level of this hoax.
[00:50:40.361 --> 00:50:44.085]  And now the weatherman says to leave your house, you got to have a microchip in your body.
[00:50:44.085 --> 00:50:47.008]  I mean, this is getting crazy.
[00:50:47.008 --> 00:50:48.070]  Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:50:50.049 --> 00:50:53.574]  Is saying, you know, put microchips in kids and we're showing Sweden right now.
[00:50:53.574 --> 00:50:57.939]  You can show California, you can show the UK, you can show Canada, you can show the US.
[00:50:57.939 --> 00:50:58.800]  It's all the same.
[00:50:58.800 --> 00:50:59.942]  The graph looks the same.
[00:50:59.942 --> 00:51:01.524]  They're way up here prediction.
[00:51:01.524 --> 00:51:03.667]  We're way down here.
[00:51:03.667 --> 00:51:07.652]  But then they call hills and valleys of supposed COVID.
[00:51:09.158 --> 00:51:10.880]  They call that the ups.
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:17.145]  They report on the ups of that when all it is is them reporting normal people that died of pre-existing conditions.
[00:51:17.145 --> 00:51:20.889]  Paul, this is the biggest hoax on the planet's ever seen.
[00:51:20.889 --> 00:51:24.752]  My God, where do you think this is going and how do we stop this?
[00:51:24.752 --> 00:51:30.277]  I mean, it's going to having mandatory government apps on your phone that listen to your conversations.
[00:51:30.277 --> 00:51:35.022]  We know they've already got the technology for that and the microchip, which is what they've proposed.
[00:51:35.652 --> 00:51:39.034]  The fact is, somebody did a study.
[00:51:39.034 --> 00:51:45.737]  Eight people under the age of 19 die in the UK every year from putting their trousers on.
[00:51:45.737 --> 00:51:51.079]  That's the same number of people under the age of 19 who have died from Covid in the UK.
[00:51:51.079 --> 00:51:55.241]  You had the director of the Department of Public Health, Dr Iziki,
[00:51:55.939 --> 00:52:06.305]  Come out and say, quote, it means technically even if you died of a clear alternate cause, but you had COVID at the same time, it's still listed as a COVID death.
[00:52:06.305 --> 00:52:07.745]  She admitted to it.
[00:52:07.745 --> 00:52:11.587]  There's a meme, man killed by shark dies of coronavirus.
[00:52:11.587 --> 00:52:13.108]  That's literally what it is.
[00:52:13.108 --> 00:52:16.490]  The vast majority of these people would tragically have died anyway.
[00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:18.731]  They're all being counted as COVID deaths.
[00:52:18.731 --> 00:52:22.733]  There needs to be a separation in the data of those deaths.
[00:52:22.733 --> 00:52:23.694]  But no, they're not.
[00:52:23.854 --> 00:52:24.394]  We're good to go.
[00:52:42.822 --> 00:52:52.177]  Infowars.com and Newswars.com are some of the only independent pro-freedom, pro-human sites that actually have audio and video and reports and crew and guests.
[00:52:52.177 --> 00:52:54.601]  All the major platforms are shutting everybody down.
[00:52:55.728 --> 00:52:57.308]  They're shutting medical doctors down.
[00:52:57.308 --> 00:52:59.389]  They're shutting down prestigious scientists.
[00:52:59.389 --> 00:53:04.190]  They're shutting down Cedars-Sinai when they come out and say Trump is right about light therapy.
[00:53:04.190 --> 00:53:06.690]  This is total control to push this agenda.
[00:53:06.690 --> 00:53:08.130]  It's by design.
[00:53:08.130 --> 00:53:09.011]  It's draconian.
[00:53:09.011 --> 00:53:10.271]  It's all admitted.
[00:53:10.271 --> 00:53:11.171]  No more denial.
[00:53:11.171 --> 00:53:16.132]  And don't forget, Paul has his excellent site, summit.news.
[00:53:16.132 --> 00:53:20.913]  And don't forget, we have the big mega-sale, the biggest of the year yet, that has to end this weekend.

[00:53:51.046 --> 00:53:55.867]  It's not just myself or the host at InfoWars, or the researchers, or the journalists.
[00:53:55.867 --> 00:54:00.409]  It's you, the listeners, the activists, the people on the front lines, in the arena.
[00:54:00.409 --> 00:54:04.510]  And it's the amazing guests and individuals that we interview.
[00:54:04.870 --> 00:54:09.772]  They make InfoWars so special because we're not putting a filter in front of free minds.
[00:54:09.772 --> 00:54:20.336]  We're having an open discussion about the real state of the world, not the establishment and talking points that are put out by the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group, the Davos Group, and other globalists.
[00:54:20.956 --> 00:54:29.119]  We're pushing for a pro-human future where we build a planet and beyond based on humans, for humans, by humans.
[00:54:29.119 --> 00:54:36.342]  Not a world where the establishment take themselves, project their hate onto us and decide we're going to have a post-human world.
[00:54:36.342 --> 00:54:39.303]  I'm really excited to know that InfoWars has your support.
[00:54:39.303 --> 00:54:45.125]  I want to thank you all for being pro-human and pro-God.
[00:54:45.125 --> 00:54:49.927]  Serving with InfoWars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[00:54:51.300 --> 00:55:00.707]  And luckily, our break room at the InfoWars headquarters is stocked full of high-quality InfoWars store Patriot Blend coffee.
[00:55:00.707 --> 00:55:12.355]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic, non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[00:55:12.355 --> 00:55:16.539]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[00:55:17.459 --> 00:55:21.481]  There has never been a more important time to support InfoWars.
[00:55:21.481 --> 00:55:28.383]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.
[00:55:28.383 --> 00:55:31.304]  Order now at the InfoWars store.

[00:55:47.350 --> 00:55:53.714]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:55:53.714 --> 00:56:00.317]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:56:00.317 --> 00:56:14.986]  So now, mainline reporters that just do stories covering the different ideas and theories about where COVID-19 came from, as the evidence amounts it was made in a lab and released on purpose, are being blocked by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.
[00:56:15.788 --> 00:56:21.431]  Now Twitter announced last week that they're going to be blocking tweets in live time with AI before you can even send them out.
[00:56:21.431 --> 00:56:36.100]  And a bunch of people I've talked to, like Millie Weaver, Caitlin Bennett and others, are trying to just put out reports and if they say hydroxychloroquine anywhere in there, just covering what Trump says, they're not allowed to upload it.
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:38.501]  So this is the total censorship.
[00:56:38.501 --> 00:56:41.263]  But in the UK, Paul Watson's written for Summit.News,
[00:56:42.281 --> 00:56:58.448]  They are now sending people to your house, including Nigel Farage, the shadow prime minister, the man behind Boris Johnson, because he dared, as a journalist, go show where the Muslims are still invading, at the coastline.
[00:56:58.448 --> 00:57:00.108]  This is total tyranny.
[00:57:00.108 --> 00:57:01.809]  This is the power grab.
[00:57:01.809 --> 00:57:05.311]  This is the great leap forward of the post-human era.
[00:57:05.311 --> 00:57:08.272]  Paul Watson, tell us about the latest developments in the UK that we know is a beta test.
[00:57:09.915 --> 00:57:20.222]  Well, of course, over the past few weeks, we've had numerous stories about police using surveillance drones to harass and publicly shame people for walking their dogs in remote areas of the countryside.
[00:57:20.222 --> 00:57:21.863]  They were very proud about that.
[00:57:21.863 --> 00:57:26.486]  We had numerous reports of people having their shopping bags inspected.
[00:57:26.486 --> 00:57:37.412]  And in one case, in fact, several cases, if you'd purchased wine or snacks, crisps, chips, stuff like that, they said they claimed that was an inessential purchase.
[00:57:37.412 --> 00:57:38.053]  Completely
[00:57:39.032 --> 00:57:45.016]  In a complete misunderstanding of the law, any shop that's open is selling essential goods.
[00:57:45.016 --> 00:57:50.220]  And that's because the police are rabid communist globalist enforcers.
[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:53.622]  Yeah, and now I put up this article on Saturday.
[00:57:53.622 --> 00:57:59.406]  They're investigating people who make tweets dissenting against social distancing and lockdown.
[00:57:59.406 --> 00:58:01.347]  Somebody who was quite vehement in doing so.
[00:58:02.060 --> 00:58:13.488]  Notice that after he had tweeted critical messages against the police, the law, he went onto his LinkedIn profile and it said he had nine visits from the Metropolitan Police.
[00:58:13.488 --> 00:58:30.059]  So we've literally got a hundred thousand people from foreign countries still landing at UK airports with no health checks, no quarantine, they only just changed that law now, coming straight into the country, dispersing amongst the transport system, no checks whatsoever,
[00:58:30.822 --> 00:58:44.251]  We've got record numbers of boat migrants coming in from France, from Calais, into Dover, into the South Coast, with the government again acting as a taxi service to rescue them and bring them into the country.
[00:58:44.251 --> 00:58:46.412]  Meanwhile, we're under house arrest.
[00:58:46.412 --> 00:58:51.996]  Meanwhile, Nigel Farage goes and reports on it, takes a cameraman, talked us a two-minute piece to camera.
[00:58:52.682 --> 00:58:57.766]  The day after he gets a visit from the police even though he's part of the media.
[00:58:57.766 --> 00:58:59.968]  He's got a national newspaper column.
[00:58:59.968 --> 00:59:03.691]  He's a national syndicator radio host with LBC.
[00:59:03.691 --> 00:59:08.354]  That is under the government's own law an essential key worker.
[00:59:08.354 --> 00:59:12.818]  He's in the media yet he still gets a visit from the police warning him not to do that.
[00:59:12.818 --> 00:59:17.261]  He said he's going to ignore that warning and again that's because of people tackling on him.
[00:59:17.261 --> 00:59:18.162]  You also have Alex
[00:59:19.013 --> 00:59:32.486]  This kind of new high priest class of the people who are wearing the masks and it's become this kind of status symbol of them being better than you because they're obeying the law better than you and they get to preach that you're not obeying social distancing.
[00:59:32.486 --> 00:59:33.127]  Funny thing is
[00:59:34.151 --> 00:59:46.019]  Over the entire UK, people are noticing these PPE, these masks are being just thrown on the floor as litter across the entire country, potentially infecting anyone who picks them up.
[00:59:46.019 --> 00:59:55.165]  So the people who are so, you know, uptight about not spreading the disease, once they've done with the masks, are just discarding it onto the side of the road.
[00:59:55.165 --> 00:59:56.046]  Oh, it's all virtue signaling.
[00:59:56.306 --> 00:59:57.968]  It's all virtue signaling crap.
[00:59:57.968 --> 01:00:07.759]  Isn't the key though, the UN's on admission that 100 million are set to starve, 30 million right now, and pointing out to their face you're causing mass collapse worldwide while you sit here on welfare?
[01:00:07.759 --> 01:00:08.841]  We've got to get back to work, Paul.
[01:00:10.854 --> 01:00:14.555]  Yeah, but the irony is that the lockdown is causing mass death.
[01:00:14.555 --> 01:00:21.216]  It's going to cause 1.4 million TB deaths across the whole world because people can't get treatment.
[01:00:21.216 --> 01:00:25.037]  The lockdown is the mass killer, way more than coronavirus.
[01:00:25.037 --> 01:00:25.337]  That's right.
[01:00:25.337 --> 01:00:31.478]  All the experts, who are not getting much media play, but they're saying this, are desperately trying to warn people of that fact.
[01:00:31.478 --> 01:00:31.918]  Well, that's right.
[01:00:31.918 --> 01:00:34.419]  The media goes, COVID-19 causing global starvation.
[01:00:34.419 --> 01:00:35.819]  No, the lockdown is.
[01:00:35.819 --> 01:00:36.959]  Summit.News.
[01:00:36.959 --> 01:00:40.000]  Paul Joseph Watson, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:40.400]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:00:41.067 --> 01:00:42.108]  Stay with us.
[01:00:42.108 --> 01:00:47.292]  Your phone calls, a ton of news, and then David Icke on the most censored broadcast in the world.
[01:00:47.292 --> 01:00:49.454]  Whatever you do, don't spread the word.
[01:00:49.454 --> 01:00:50.575]  Lay down and die.
[01:00:52.378 --> 01:01:07.087]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles, and when you shoot an elk at say 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run 50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards.
[01:01:07.087 --> 01:01:17.593]  They've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins, but all of a sudden they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over, and they die.
[01:01:17.593 --> 01:01:19.815]  Then you go bag them and haul them back in.
[01:01:20.675 --> 01:01:24.176]  Well, that's what's going to happen to the entire world now.
[01:01:24.176 --> 01:01:30.059]  And that's what the economic numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the heart.
[01:01:30.059 --> 01:01:35.141]  And for the first world, it's going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[01:01:35.141 --> 01:01:39.343]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead, according to the UN, and I believe their numbers.
[01:01:39.983 --> 01:01:44.712]  Because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world.
[01:01:44.712 --> 01:01:51.024]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're a bunch of suckers and you bought into something bigger than what Hitler did.
[01:02:04.662 --> 01:02:14.631]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:02:14.631 --> 01:02:21.237]  Well, you know Bill and Melinda Gates' patent to track you by microchip or arm bracelet to buy and sell under COVID-19.
[01:02:21.237 --> 01:02:25.942]  They have another patent to put an implantable chip in your skin that's ink inside the vaccine.
[01:02:27.415 --> 01:02:41.947]  Well, now a bill's been introduced for $100 million by the Democrats to have contract tracers that track and trace and enforce the next wave of the lockdowns that are coming and the big bio-attack that is phase two that Bill Gates says is coming.
[01:02:41.947 --> 01:02:43.888]  And believe me, he should know.
[01:02:43.888 --> 01:02:50.234]  This is just a drill to make sure you shelter in place and die inside your home when they launch the real bio-attack.
[01:02:50.734 --> 01:02:52.176]  All the evidence shows.
[01:02:52.176 --> 01:02:54.199]  But this powerful report is on Band.Video.
[01:02:54.199 --> 01:02:57.483]  There's a new bill that has 666 in the title.
[01:02:57.483 --> 01:02:59.326]  They seem to always do this.
[01:02:59.326 --> 01:03:03.191]  That's HR6666, the bill of the beast.
[01:03:03.191 --> 01:03:03.611]  Here it is.
[01:03:04.588 --> 01:03:12.653]  The World Health Organization recommended forcibly removing family members from their homes and putting them in quarantine.
[01:03:12.653 --> 01:03:22.860]  Now we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:26.682]  Queen Elizabeth seemed to be echoing this idea to the UK.
[01:03:26.682 --> 01:03:32.766]  It reminds me of the very first broadcast I made in 1940, helped by my sister.
[01:03:34.312 --> 01:03:44.339]  We as children spoke from here at Windsor to children who had been evacuated from their homes and sent away for their own safety.
[01:03:44.339 --> 01:03:50.444]  Today, once again, many will feel a painful sense of separation from their loved ones.
[01:03:52.182 --> 01:03:57.805]  But now as in, we know deep down that it is the right thing to do.
[01:03:57.805 --> 01:04:02.929]  Bill Gates has been pushing the idea of tracking people with digital tattoos.
[01:04:02.929 --> 01:04:14.796]  And Microsoft was recently granted patent number 060606 for a cryptocurrency surveillance system connected to the human body.
[01:04:14.796 --> 01:04:16.377]  Now enter HR6666.
[01:04:19.488 --> 01:04:41.011]  To authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID-19 and related activities such as contact tracing through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals' residences and for other purposes.
[01:04:42.312 --> 01:04:49.518]  On May 1st of 2020, Illinois Congressman Bobby Rush introduced H.R.
[01:04:49.518 --> 01:04:50.479]  6666.
[01:04:50.479 --> 01:04:57.364]  This act is essentially setting up a nationwide contact tracing and quarantine program run by Big Pharma.
[01:04:58.485 --> 01:05:22.161]  Section 2 COVID-19 testing and contact tracing using mobile health units will allow Bill Gates loyalist Alex Azar and the CDC to fund eligible entities to conduct tests, trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals and to support the quarantine of these contacts via mobile health units.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:27.603]  Who are the eligible entities qualified to receive this funding?
[01:05:27.603 --> 01:05:35.728]  Health centers, non-profit organizations, high schools, and anyone else that Alex Azar deems eligible.
[01:05:35.728 --> 01:05:44.554]  The amount of taxpayer dollars being asked for to trace the public and force quarantines is $100 billion for 2020 alone.
[01:05:44.554 --> 01:05:50.237]  And whatever may be necessary as long as the emergency period continues.
[01:05:50.237 --> 01:05:52.479]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:05:55.868 --> 01:06:06.790]  By the way, if you want to see his amazing reports, you simply go to Bandot Video, click on the left-hand corner, go to the Gregory's section, and you can see all of those reports there.
[01:06:06.790 --> 01:06:12.651]  The average report has about 170,000 views, which is a real shame.
[01:06:12.651 --> 01:06:16.832]  They need to be seen by millions and millions and millions of people.
[01:06:16.832 --> 01:06:17.912]  They're absolutely critical.
[01:06:17.912 --> 01:06:22.113]  He's got a big one he's getting ready that we're going to air in the second segment
[01:06:23.334 --> 01:06:25.515]  of the fourth hour today.
[01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:31.396]  And then, Gerald Cilente will take over into the war room with Owen Schroer.
[01:06:31.396 --> 01:06:33.457]  This is causing a worldwide meltdown.
[01:06:33.457 --> 01:06:36.358]  Now Hollywood and the globalists admit, oh, it's for the earth.
[01:06:36.358 --> 01:06:37.998]  It's good to have the lockdown.
[01:06:37.998 --> 01:06:39.919]  You're never going to have your job again.
[01:06:39.919 --> 01:06:44.860]  First, they told you that industry and farming was bad, that you would be a service person.
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:45.900]  That would be the new economy.
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:47.941]  Now that they got you to be obsolete.
[01:06:48.953 --> 01:06:54.438]  They're replacing you with robots and saying, don't worry, you'll get a universal income.
[01:06:54.438 --> 01:06:56.960]  That's a pittance, but you got to take the vaccines.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:06:58.221]  You got to do what we say.
[01:06:58.221 --> 01:07:05.908]  Now the new DNA vaccines go into your cells and reprogram them at the cellular level.
[01:07:05.908 --> 01:07:08.550]  That's called cancer.
[01:07:08.550 --> 01:07:09.831]  And it's so incredibly dangerous.
[01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:18.622]  Meanwhile, 1.4 million people to die from untreated TB due to coronavirus lockdown.
[01:07:18.622 --> 01:07:31.468]  Scientists in Brazil have found that countries most affected by the coronavirus spread are the ones continuing to allow unrestricted travel across their borders, prompting further arguments that the most effective method of preventing the spread is tighter frontier controls.
[01:07:31.468 --> 01:07:33.870]  The research carried out by the Federal University of
[01:07:34.790 --> 01:07:41.092]  Salvador suggests that screening and quarantining those coming into countries from the outside could be the best way.
[01:07:41.092 --> 01:07:51.274]  But it goes into break down the fact that TB now is exploding and because of people not getting treatment from it, they estimate 1.4 million additional will die.
[01:07:51.274 --> 01:07:55.235]  In fact, even the London Guardian has reported that as well.
[01:07:55.235 --> 01:07:57.376]  So, let's go ahead and look at the facts.
[01:07:57.376 --> 01:08:01.317]  Why are 15,000 people a day flying into the UK unrestricted, untested?
[01:08:01.317 --> 01:08:02.457]  Because it's all a hoax!
[01:08:03.544 --> 01:08:12.108]  They count all normal deaths from cancer or heart attacks or other diseases in the column.
[01:08:12.108 --> 01:08:13.229]  That's all admitted.
[01:08:13.229 --> 01:08:21.173]  And I keep harping on that because this is designed to bring down our economy.
[01:08:21.173 --> 01:08:26.455]  Now, what I wanna do is open the phones up and I wanna discuss this with everybody.
[01:08:26.455 --> 01:08:29.377]  In the next segment, I'm gonna get into this really important piece.
[01:08:30.265 --> 01:08:36.710]  Because we've seen these Moody's and Barron's and all the people that rape the stock market.
[01:08:36.710 --> 01:08:43.576]  Talk about insiders come out and say, oh, if we open things, it'll cause a depression because we'll never get rid of COVID.
[01:08:43.576 --> 01:08:48.721]  They chose the common cold that they patented and own so that it never goes away.
[01:08:48.721 --> 01:08:50.883]  So everyone's suspect.
[01:08:50.883 --> 01:08:52.964]  And so they can attribute it to every death.
[01:08:52.964 --> 01:08:54.626]  That's how the scam works.
[01:08:56.443 --> 01:08:57.224]  U.S.
[01:08:57.224 --> 01:09:01.347]  risking a second wave and a depression, Mark Zandi warns.
[01:09:01.347 --> 01:09:03.408]  We're going to cover this and then go to your calls.
[01:09:03.408 --> 01:09:05.850]  Start of the next segment.
[01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:11.634]  I want to give first time callers a chance to call in, particularly medical workers, law enforcement, military.
[01:09:13.558 --> 01:09:15.179]  You'll go to the head of the line because I want to hear from you.
[01:09:15.179 --> 01:09:16.119]  We're going to go to everybody.
[01:09:16.119 --> 01:09:19.862]  First-time callers, please give us your take on the situation.
[01:09:19.862 --> 01:09:20.042]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:20.042 --> 01:09:20.242]  877-789-Alex.
[01:09:20.242 --> 01:09:20.302]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:20.302 --> 01:09:21.883]  Some folks don't have 1-800-CALLING from outside the U.S.
[01:09:21.883 --> 01:09:23.624]  So you dial your country code and then 512-646-1776.
[01:09:23.624 --> 01:09:23.704]  512-646-1776.
[01:09:23.704 --> 01:09:25.265]  And we'll go to your phone calls.
[01:09:41.547 --> 01:09:42.808]  And I'm not going to be rude.
[01:09:42.808 --> 01:09:43.969]  What's rude is making a hold.
[01:09:43.969 --> 01:09:47.933]  I'm going to try to go to you quickly and move the next person without the pleasantries.
[01:09:47.933 --> 01:09:51.035]  So in the interest of that, I'm not going to thank you for calling.
[01:09:51.035 --> 01:09:51.876]  I'm just going to go to you.
[01:09:51.876 --> 01:09:56.820]  We're going to test that out today, because by the time I thank you and you thank me, we've blown 20 seconds of what you could be saying.
[01:09:56.820 --> 01:10:00.844]  So I'm just going to say, boom, you're on, boom, you're gone, boom, you're on, boom, you're gone.
[01:10:00.844 --> 01:10:02.565]  Like I used to do 25 years ago.
[01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:03.446]  We'll see if we can do that.
[01:10:03.446 --> 01:10:05.148]  877-789-2539.
[01:10:05.148 --> 01:10:05.248]  Okay.
[01:10:10.686 --> 01:10:19.552]  I'm also going to be interviewing David Icke coming up in the next hour.
[01:10:19.552 --> 01:10:31.399]  And then, of course, we've got the situation coming out with General Flynn and some of the articles dealing with that on InfoWars.com.
[01:10:31.399 --> 01:10:38.604]  How now even the DOJ is slamming NBC's Chuck Todd over deceptive editing of AG Barr interview.
[01:10:38.604 --> 01:10:39.825]  Yeah, how's that feel, Barr?
[01:10:41.325 --> 01:10:47.138]  When the media lies about what you say, and then comes after you.
[01:10:50.458 --> 01:10:57.999]  I've had the Attorney General of New York, who we're considering legal action against right now, say that I claim I have a cure to COVID-19 or a treatment.
[01:10:57.999 --> 01:11:00.780]  I never said any such thing.
[01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:06.121]  And then she used the claims that I was committing crimes to try to get my operation shut down.
[01:11:06.121 --> 01:11:10.762]  And I'll be talking about it soon, but folks, these people are monsters.
[01:11:10.762 --> 01:11:13.702]  And they've gotten away with all this crime and they think they're invincible.
[01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:16.322]  It's unbelievable.
[01:11:16.322 --> 01:11:19.003]  And now they've been caught editing with jump cuts over him.
[01:11:21.121 --> 01:11:23.022]  That's what Megyn Kelly did to me.
[01:11:23.022 --> 01:11:25.824]  I told Megyn Kelly I thought that Sandy Hook happened.
[01:11:25.824 --> 01:11:26.444]  She edited it.
[01:11:26.444 --> 01:11:28.485]  Probably have to sue NBC.
[01:11:28.485 --> 01:11:29.025]  That's coming up.
[01:11:29.025 --> 01:11:31.727]  I mean, these people are just crooks, man.
[01:11:31.727 --> 01:11:35.109]  Everybody knows it, and I'm so tired of it.
[01:11:35.109 --> 01:11:35.929]  I'm so sick of it.
[01:11:35.929 --> 01:11:42.913]  CBS just got caught staging people going into hospitals and fake lines of cars, as we first reported.
[01:11:42.913 --> 01:11:46.815]  There's no depth to which these criminals will not sink.
[01:11:46.815 --> 01:11:49.677]  And now they're telling us we're locked down under martial law forever.
[01:11:50.197 --> 01:11:55.044]  Ten weeks ago, I began to tell listeners that they needed to get high-quality, storable food.
[01:11:55.044 --> 01:12:06.219]  Not because of the virus, but because of the crises and the economic shutdown it would cause, because the Globals were planning to hold America hostage and run a blockade through the blue cities and blue states.
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:11.403]  Now that prediction has come true because the globalists are running an operation.
[01:12:11.403 --> 01:12:13.364]  It's not predictions.
[01:12:13.364 --> 01:12:15.665]  We have their battle plans.
[01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:23.910]  So, going back more than eight weeks ago, all major storable food companies were sold out except My Patriot Supply because they're the biggest and were prepositioned.
[01:12:23.910 --> 01:12:31.935]  When it got to the point that they had so many orders coming in that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them in a timely manner, they stopped taking orders until they got caught back up.
[01:12:31.935 --> 01:12:32.075]  Well,
[01:12:32.595 --> 01:12:33.576]  Now they're caught back up.
[01:12:33.576 --> 01:12:37.378]  They've got high-quality storable food in stock, ready to be packaged and shipped to you.
[01:12:37.378 --> 01:12:45.783]  Get your orders in now at InfoWarStore.com to go right at the head of the queue and get delivered to you as fast as possible and from the InfoWar.
[01:12:45.783 --> 01:12:48.065]  Get your storable food now at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:12:49.205 --> 01:12:52.467]  I'm cutting this ad on May 10th, 2020.
[01:12:52.467 --> 01:12:59.792]  And within a week or so, many of the best-selling items that we're selling at InfoWareStore.com will no longer be at 50% off.
[01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:06.437]  In fact, last year I said I can't get 50% off anymore because our markup just isn't enough for us to be able to get enough profit to operate this operation.
[01:13:06.917 --> 01:13:09.998]  But I want you to get the Ultimate Krill Oil.
[01:13:09.998 --> 01:13:12.018]  I want you to get Bazo Beats.
[01:13:12.018 --> 01:13:14.199]  I want you to get DNA Force Plus.
[01:13:14.199 --> 01:13:16.360]  I want you to experience X2.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:19.461]  I want you to get Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus.
[01:13:19.461 --> 01:13:21.801]  They're all in stock right now and they're 30 to 60% off.
[01:13:24.722 --> 01:13:36.973]  More than 20 items are 50% off right now, but we're going to have to end the sale on most items in about a week, because a lot of the products are getting close to selling out, like Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, and Azobeats.
[01:13:36.973 --> 01:13:42.217]  So take action, be healthier, boost your body's natural defenses, and fund the InfoWar.
[01:13:42.217 --> 01:13:44.239]  Get these great products at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:13:52.443 --> 01:14:02.973]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:14:02.973 --> 01:14:04.675]  Big Brother.
[01:14:04.675 --> 01:14:07.017]  Mainstream media.
[01:14:07.017 --> 01:14:08.799]  Government cover-ups.
[01:14:08.799 --> 01:14:10.880]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.022]  Well, so does he.
[01:14:13.022 --> 01:14:17.627]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:14:25.077 --> 01:14:26.758]  The same thing we do every day, Pinky.
[01:14:26.758 --> 01:14:28.859]  Taking over the world.
[01:14:28.859 --> 01:14:31.440]  That's Pinky and the Brain.
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:34.261]  There are always people that want to dominate and take control of everything.
[01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:35.482]  It's their nature.
[01:14:35.482 --> 01:14:40.444]  And globalism is a corporate takeover of the nation-state.
[01:14:40.444 --> 01:14:45.186]  Globalism is total domination.
[01:14:45.186 --> 01:14:46.287]  For domination's sake.
[01:14:47.924 --> 01:15:00.909]  Anti-God, anti-family, because people that have God and have family are self-sufficient and strong and they're not easily malleable like clay to the potter.
[01:15:00.909 --> 01:15:13.094]  And so we watched, going back three months ago, four months ago, all these financial experts, all these billionaires, going on CNBC, going on MSNBC, going on CNN saying,
[01:15:14.082 --> 01:15:18.247]  If Trump doesn't lock the economy down, we're going to have a total depression.
[01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:21.811]  We're like, really, if you lock it down, it'll cause a depression.
[01:15:21.811 --> 01:15:30.982]  Then it turned out those individuals had done giant put options against the stock market, and when it plunged, they made billions of dollars.
[01:15:30.982 --> 01:15:32.684]  One guy made $2 billion in one day.
[01:15:34.389 --> 01:15:38.331]  Oh, but Martha Stewart went to jail for selling a million dollars or whatever of her stock, 800,000.
[01:15:38.331 --> 01:15:41.933]  Oh, but when they do it, it's okay, it's good.
[01:15:41.933 --> 01:15:46.436]  Well, Moody's, that tells you what everything's valued.
[01:15:46.436 --> 01:15:52.520]  Mark Zandi has come out and said, oh, the states are opening too soon.
[01:15:52.520 --> 01:15:58.763]  And if that happens, why, it's going to cause another wave, which they're always planning to say is another wave.
[01:15:58.763 --> 01:16:00.344]  Again, all their numbers were 40, 50 times off.
[01:16:02.230 --> 01:16:06.512]  They adjusted them, and now they zoom way down to the little tiny number and make it huge.
[01:16:06.512 --> 01:16:07.252]  What?
[01:16:07.252 --> 01:16:08.913]  Well, we've got an emergency!
[01:16:08.913 --> 01:16:10.894]  Five new cases in Wuhan!
[01:16:10.894 --> 01:16:14.756]  Everybody run for the hills!
[01:16:14.756 --> 01:16:16.676]  My Germany's got 50 new cases.
[01:16:16.676 --> 01:16:18.978]  We're all dead!
[01:16:18.978 --> 01:16:21.979]  For seven and a half billion people.
[01:16:21.979 --> 01:16:25.721]  Up to 60 million die a year.
[01:16:25.721 --> 01:16:30.062]  Millions are dying from TB that can't get treatment, and heart attacks, and cancer, and suicide.
[01:16:30.062 --> 01:16:30.803]  But that's okay!
[01:16:31.869 --> 01:16:33.431]  Let's put up the world map here, Ken.
[01:16:33.431 --> 01:16:36.455]  We have the supposed dead worldwide.
[01:16:36.455 --> 01:16:38.458]  Not even near a million.
[01:16:38.458 --> 01:16:40.741]  And that's with them appropriating every death.
[01:16:40.741 --> 01:16:49.412]  But I predict by the end of this year, they'll say 20 million worldwide because they incentivize money by global standardization to the WHO.
[01:16:52.534 --> 01:16:55.576]  Where everyone's going to say it's a COVID death to get that money.
[01:16:55.576 --> 01:16:57.717]  Because we have a global government.
[01:16:57.717 --> 01:16:59.538]  We have private corporate groups dictating.
[01:16:59.538 --> 01:17:01.880]  So let's put it back on screen.
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:03.961]  283,000 deaths globally.
[01:17:03.961 --> 01:17:07.423]  79,000 in the U.S.
[01:17:07.423 --> 01:17:08.924]  32,000 in the U.K.
[01:17:08.924 --> 01:17:10.565]  30,000 in Italy.
[01:17:10.565 --> 01:17:14.607]  26,000 in Spain, France, Brazil.
[01:17:14.607 --> 01:17:18.609]  Brazil was going to be a million dead because Palosaro didn't lock it down.
[01:17:18.609 --> 01:17:18.970]  Now it's 11,207.
[01:17:23.442 --> 01:17:25.206]  Let's look at Sweden.
[01:17:25.206 --> 01:17:26.448]  They didn't do anything.
[01:17:26.448 --> 01:17:27.591]  They've got one of the lowest deaths.
[01:17:27.591 --> 01:17:32.802]  That's because they're not doing fraudulent testing.
[01:17:32.802 --> 01:17:34.726]  It's all a giant scam.
[01:17:37.824 --> 01:17:49.235]  And they're gonna have the blue cities and the blue states first, and the big corporations not let you leave your house, not let you have a job, unless you've got that ID card or that digital app on your phone saying you're kosher.
[01:17:49.235 --> 01:18:02.447]  And morons that opt into this, like they're the good people, they're the heroes, they need to be confronted with the fact that they're schmucks, engineering a global financial collapse and mass death in the third world of tens of millions!
[01:18:03.919 --> 01:18:06.160]  Who can't get basic medicine!
[01:18:06.160 --> 01:18:07.621]  And who are starving to death!
[01:18:07.621 --> 01:18:09.102]  That's the real world!
[01:18:09.102 --> 01:18:11.764]  You delicate geniuses!
[01:18:11.764 --> 01:18:13.985]  You beautiful leftist losers!
[01:18:13.985 --> 01:18:17.947]  You dumbass followers!
[01:18:17.947 --> 01:18:20.209]  Oh, but here's Mark Zandy!
[01:18:22.952 --> 01:18:25.893]  Mark Zandi, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:25.893 --> 01:18:28.273]  Yeah, blow that up on screen for me over here, please.
[01:18:28.273 --> 01:18:30.854]  My eyes aren't what they used to be, I can't see it over there.
[01:18:30.854 --> 01:18:32.935]  How many people we got dead in Sweden?
[01:18:32.935 --> 01:18:35.515]  Let's see the numbers in Sweden for me.
[01:18:35.515 --> 01:18:40.037]  Pretty please, cupcakes on top.
[01:18:40.037 --> 01:18:45.118]  3,256 in Sweden.
[01:18:45.118 --> 01:18:47.119]  What's the flu usually killing Sweden every year?
[01:18:47.119 --> 01:18:47.879]  I was looking it up, about 15,000.
[01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:52.471]  Of course, there's no deaths now in the U.S.
[01:18:52.471 --> 01:18:54.994]  from flu, because they're all attributed to COVID!
[01:18:54.994 --> 01:18:56.095]  COVID!
[01:18:56.095 --> 01:18:57.156]  COVID!
[01:18:57.156 --> 01:18:57.616]  COVID!
[01:18:57.616 --> 01:19:04.863]  They ought to have that as the new European siren on police cars, instead of... There's COVID!
[01:19:04.863 --> 01:19:05.783]  COVID!
[01:19:05.783 --> 01:19:06.584]  COVID!
[01:19:06.584 --> 01:19:08.005]  Oh, what in a civilization!
[01:19:08.005 --> 01:19:17.434]  Oh, a panic over a virus, run by Bill and Melinda Gates' psychotics that said they want a global reset, and to shut the economy down, and now Hollywood's celebrating it, saying we all deserve to starve to death!
[01:19:18.814 --> 01:19:19.795]  But it's okay.
[01:19:19.795 --> 01:19:26.659]  Here's Mark Zandi on CNBC telling you he doesn't want a depression.
[01:19:26.659 --> 01:19:28.241]  So just keep the economy shut down.
[01:19:28.241 --> 01:19:34.125]  It's like saying, I don't want you to die, so let me shoot you in the head with a 12 gauge shotgun at point blank range.
[01:19:34.125 --> 01:19:35.566]  You're like, that'll kill me.
[01:19:35.566 --> 01:19:37.847]  No, it won't.
[01:19:37.847 --> 01:19:39.148]  He's like, I love your thumb.
[01:19:39.148 --> 01:19:42.971]  Let me smash it with a hammer.
[01:19:42.971 --> 01:19:44.512]  Oh, but he's a hero.
[01:19:45.666 --> 01:19:47.607]  Here's to you, Mr. Hero!
[01:19:47.607 --> 01:19:48.947]  Here's to you, Mark Zandi!
[01:19:48.947 --> 01:19:50.708]  Here he is!
[01:19:50.708 --> 01:19:53.569]  The prospect of a depression, given the data we have today.
[01:19:53.569 --> 01:19:55.949]  Mark, your thoughts there?
[01:19:55.949 --> 01:20:06.233]  Well, I think if we reopen too quickly and we see infections rise, get a second wave, that causes more business disruption.
[01:20:06.233 --> 01:20:10.974]  We may not shut down again, but certainly it will scare people, spook people, and weigh on the economy.
[01:20:10.974 --> 01:20:13.015]  That would be the fodder for a depression.
[01:20:14.036 --> 01:20:17.439]  Nomenclature depression would be double-digit unemployment for more than a year.
[01:20:17.439 --> 01:20:18.400]  We already have that.
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:24.505]  You know, if we get through this period without another wave, then this will end up being a really bad recession.
[01:20:24.505 --> 01:20:28.968]  But if we get a second wave, it'll be depression.
[01:20:28.968 --> 01:20:31.991]  And of course they're gonna call it a second wave and a third and a fourth and a fifth.
[01:20:31.991 --> 01:20:35.354]  Bill Gates said last week, I played the clip last hour, he said,
[01:20:37.182 --> 01:20:45.987]  Talking to Stephen Colbert, the comic that poses a newsman that now poses as our doctor, he said, oh, this is just wave one.
[01:20:45.987 --> 01:20:48.048]  The next wave's a bio-attack.
[01:20:48.048 --> 01:20:50.830]  As I've told you for years, a real bio-attack.
[01:20:50.830 --> 01:20:58.474]  This is just making sure you behave yourself, because they don't want things to get out of hand when they really take an axe to your ass.
[01:20:58.474 --> 01:21:00.635]  And so that's what I've been telling listeners.
[01:21:00.635 --> 01:21:02.236]  I'm actually now moving to the country.
[01:21:02.236 --> 01:21:05.458]  I'm actually building the armored fortress.
[01:21:06.670 --> 01:21:09.753]  Look like a farmhouse, but it's gonna have steel walls.
[01:21:09.753 --> 01:21:11.954]  I'm actually giving up on folks.
[01:21:11.954 --> 01:21:14.276]  I mean, spiritually, we gotta get people right with God.
[01:21:14.276 --> 01:21:16.038]  We're gonna try to fix things.
[01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:19.160]  But we failed to stop the globalist takeover at this level.
[01:21:19.160 --> 01:21:21.162]  We knew it'd be a biological weapon attack.
[01:21:21.162 --> 01:21:23.324]  We first said it'd be a simulant to lock you down.
[01:21:23.324 --> 01:21:27.828]  Been telling you that since Endgame, 2007.
[01:21:27.828 --> 01:21:30.069]  And then the real bio-attacks come after this.
[01:21:30.069 --> 01:21:32.251]  Word for word what I've told you.
[01:21:32.251 --> 01:21:35.274]  In fact, do get that Archivist we've got that's so good at finding things.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.784]  Get him to go back for the Bill Gates film we're making right now.
[01:21:39.784 --> 01:21:40.865]  This is his main job.
[01:21:40.865 --> 01:21:46.412]  And find all the times I said the first bio-attack will only kill maybe a couple hundred thousand worldwide.
[01:21:46.412 --> 01:21:48.054]  That'll be the simulant to lock everybody down.
[01:21:48.973 --> 01:21:54.315]  Then we'll have IDs and tracker chips and apps and drones and robots controlling us.
[01:21:54.315 --> 01:22:01.238]  And then the next wave will kill a couple hundred million and we'll really get locked down under that and legitimize the lockdown.
[01:22:01.238 --> 01:22:03.919]  And you wear your damn mask and you take your inoculation.
[01:22:03.919 --> 01:22:05.259]  We lost millions.
[01:22:05.259 --> 01:22:06.120]  I lost my mom.
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:06.960]  I lost my brother.
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:08.100]  You do it.
[01:22:08.100 --> 01:22:10.061]  You'll have the contact tracers ready.
[01:22:10.061 --> 01:22:12.262]  You know, the malice enforcer brigades.
[01:22:14.611 --> 01:22:31.301]  And then after we're all locked down and behaving ourselves, they won't wait long, like five years after it's all locked down, and they've purged the anti-vaxxers, they're going to release a chemical weapon that they're going to say is biological, but they'll have the cure for themselves and they're just going to kill.
[01:22:32.116 --> 01:22:34.858]  I think they'll just go for it all, that they'll kill six billion men.
[01:22:34.858 --> 01:22:35.658]  You're all dead.
[01:22:35.658 --> 01:22:48.347]  And just remember, you won't listen now, but when you're dying, flopping around like a fish, vomiting your guts out with blood coming out of your eyes, remember the devil did this to you and that Jesus is real.
[01:22:48.347 --> 01:22:52.690]  The America that we've known and loved, the America that was the land of the free, home of the brave, is dying.
[01:22:54.315 --> 01:23:01.059]  And everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating us, shutting us down, and making us dependent on them.
[01:23:01.059 --> 01:23:03.120]  The food shortages have begun.
[01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:06.042]  The depression is going to be long and very, very serious.
[01:23:06.042 --> 01:23:08.143]  In fact, it's probably too late now to even turn back.
[01:23:08.143 --> 01:23:09.184]  Trump tried to stop it.
[01:23:09.764 --> 01:23:12.306]  But the mainstream media working with the Stratcom has blocked it.
[01:23:12.306 --> 01:23:16.830]  That's why you and myself and everybody else has to get prepared now.
[01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:17.630]  Do not wait.
[01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:18.551]  It's not about the virus.
[01:23:18.551 --> 01:23:23.215]  It's about the economic chaos that's going to be unleashed in the next six months to a year.
[01:23:23.215 --> 01:23:25.817]  Get your high-quality, storable foods at InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:23:25.817 --> 01:23:28.239]  They're available again, but for a limited time.
[01:23:28.239 --> 01:23:30.180]  The food supply is running out.
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:31.662]  There are major shortages.
[01:23:32.202 --> 01:23:37.106]  This is a globalist siege, a globalist lockdown, globalist terrorism.
[01:23:37.106 --> 01:23:40.369]  But we the people, the patriots, have to be prepared.
[01:23:40.369 --> 01:23:42.270]  We've already been proven right about prepping so far.
[01:23:42.270 --> 01:23:43.711]  We'll get ready to be really proven right.
[01:23:43.711 --> 01:23:45.973]  Get your storable foods now at infowarestore.com.
[01:23:47.708 --> 01:23:50.849]  The lockdown is permanent dictatorship.
[01:23:50.849 --> 01:24:05.574]  The lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic rights being suspended and a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in full control.
[01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:07.695]  Many will submit through fear.
[01:24:07.695 --> 01:24:09.375]  Others will be bought off.
[01:24:09.375 --> 01:24:11.896]  But in the end, the globalists admit their
[01:24:12.076 --> 01:24:12.797]  We're good to go.
[01:24:47.385 --> 01:24:54.889]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[01:24:54.889 --> 01:25:01.073]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast, and I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[01:25:01.073 --> 01:25:02.494]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[01:25:02.734 --> 01:25:05.436]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[01:25:05.436 --> 01:25:07.658]  I went in a VA hospital out here in Boyston.
[01:25:07.658 --> 01:25:08.919]  I was in there until June.
[01:25:08.919 --> 01:25:14.503]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to InfoWars three hours a day.
[01:25:14.503 --> 01:25:18.186]  And I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[01:25:18.186 --> 01:25:19.067]  Let me tell you something, man.
[01:25:19.187 --> 01:25:26.028]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years and the doctors, they tried every test.
[01:25:26.028 --> 01:25:27.529]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[01:25:27.529 --> 01:25:31.510]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[01:25:31.510 --> 01:25:33.690]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[01:25:33.690 --> 01:25:38.571]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals because they don't want you to have that stuff, but I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[01:25:38.571 --> 01:25:39.111]  I got it.
[01:25:39.111 --> 01:25:40.352]  I hid it from the nurses.
[01:25:40.352 --> 01:25:41.392]  I started taking it.
[01:25:41.392 --> 01:25:43.432]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[01:25:43.432 --> 01:25:44.372]  It saved my life.
[01:25:44.372 --> 01:25:47.093]  Alex Jones and InfoWars saved my life.
[01:25:51.129 --> 01:26:04.583]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:26:04.583 --> 01:26:07.527]  On your phone calls!
[01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:16.687]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:26:16.687 --> 01:26:18.107]  I hate censors.
[01:26:18.107 --> 01:26:19.548]  I hate tyranny.
[01:26:19.548 --> 01:26:24.390]  I love America.
[01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:27.091]  Now, let's talk about this.
[01:26:27.091 --> 01:26:30.752]  Start of the next segment, I have a little surprise for everybody.
[01:26:30.752 --> 01:26:34.554]  You know San Antonio said they'll arrest you if you say the words Chinese virus.
[01:26:37.313 --> 01:26:42.756]  Well, let's just say we got a surprise up our sleeves.
[01:26:42.756 --> 01:26:45.317]  Coming up next segment, we'll show you what's going on.
[01:26:45.317 --> 01:26:48.198]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls here in 60 seconds.
[01:26:48.198 --> 01:26:53.200]  Just don't forget, we've got the biggest sale that we've run in the year so far.
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:27:01.183]  We won't have a sale this big, this wide, until Christmas, till after Thanksgiving.
[01:27:01.183 --> 01:27:03.164]  It's basically all of our best-selling supplements.
[01:27:04.612 --> 01:27:11.239]  Even the ones that are close to selling out, like Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, with the pregnant one on, for 30 to 60% off.
[01:27:11.239 --> 01:27:15.343]  8-pack Power Stack is amazing.
[01:27:15.343 --> 01:27:20.268]  It's an AM and PM pack, 13 different pills, 13 different supplements.
[01:27:20.268 --> 01:27:27.294]  This is a way for you to give friends, family, yourself, to boost your overall body's defenses, to be healthy, to sleep better, everything.
[01:27:27.294 --> 01:27:27.555]  It's 60% off.
[01:27:30.589 --> 01:27:32.510]  When they ordered it, there was a mistake last year.
[01:27:32.510 --> 01:27:34.252]  They double ordered the amount.
[01:27:34.252 --> 01:27:38.155]  Well, we've sold down now the extra amount.
[01:27:38.155 --> 01:27:40.036]  So now it's going to go back to maybe 20% off or so.
[01:27:41.824 --> 01:27:47.266]  Uh, coming up in a couple weeks because now we're not close to selling it out, but within three or four or five months will be sold out.
[01:27:47.266 --> 01:27:55.608]  So we're now going to start going back to more of a regular price to bring in some money and fund ourselves so that this thing isn't a loss because we ordered so much, but it's really a great product, a great value.
[01:27:55.608 --> 01:27:58.349]  We're selling it very close to cost at 60% off.
[01:27:58.349 --> 01:27:59.849]  It's really our best value.
[01:27:59.849 --> 01:28:01.010]  So eight pack power stack.
[01:28:02.290 --> 01:28:14.838]  60% off Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, 50% off Bazoobeat, 40% off Limited Edition InfoWars Mask, $9.95, Living Defense Plus, 50% off, that's so important, DNA Force Plus, back in stock, it's the number one product you should get.
[01:28:14.838 --> 01:28:21.822]  50% off X2, back in stock, 50% off Ultimate Crillol, back in stock, 50% off, and a bunch of other things.
[01:28:21.822 --> 01:28:30.147]  Take advantage of that now and get scorable food, because again, COVID-19's hyped up and we now understand the takeover plan.
[01:28:32.849 --> 01:28:36.992]  They chose a patented cold virus so they can say everybody was suspect.
[01:28:36.992 --> 01:28:39.494]  And so they can always say all deaths are being caused by it.
[01:28:39.494 --> 01:28:46.099]  It's built in so they can use the statistics and ramp them up with the normal death rates or ramp them down not counting the death rates.
[01:28:46.099 --> 01:28:48.201]  So this is all absolutely a scam.
[01:28:48.201 --> 01:28:49.321]  We've cracked the code.
[01:28:49.321 --> 01:28:50.402]  The president understands it.
[01:28:50.402 --> 01:28:51.883]  That's in the news now.
[01:28:51.883 --> 01:28:56.327]  But we got to go further than just sidelining the fraudulent Fauci NIH crime syndicate.
[01:28:56.327 --> 01:28:57.548]  They've got to be prosecuted.
[01:28:58.328 --> 01:29:02.690]  AP exclusive docs show that White House officials buried CDC report.
[01:29:02.690 --> 01:29:04.270]  No.
[01:29:04.270 --> 01:29:05.110]  He sidelined them.
[01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:09.472]  He was thinking about getting rid of it completely, but instead of making them victims, he just sidelined these lying monsters.
[01:29:09.472 --> 01:29:17.755]  So, Fauci, to get headlines again, goes, I'm self-quarantining because eight people in the White House tested positive for coronavirus.
[01:29:17.755 --> 01:29:21.236]  Which, again, a papaya or a goat will test positive.
[01:29:21.236 --> 01:29:27.638]  This is part of him grabbing headlines again when it comes out that he jailed a top scientist that exposed him profiting off HIV drugs.
[01:29:29.394 --> 01:29:32.235]  But their attempt to silence her has only failed as well.
[01:29:32.235 --> 01:29:34.556]  Word is she's going to be testifying in Congress.
[01:29:34.556 --> 01:29:36.357]  So the globalists are in a lot of trouble.
[01:29:36.357 --> 01:29:38.918]  The problem is they're going to launch even bigger attacks now.
[01:29:38.918 --> 01:29:41.279]  What's coming next after the COVID hoax?
[01:29:41.279 --> 01:29:42.119]  Depression!
[01:29:42.119 --> 01:29:43.840]  And then more COVID hoax!
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:48.222]  Because it's built in because it's the cold virus.
[01:29:48.222 --> 01:29:49.682]  Unbelievable.
[01:29:49.682 --> 01:29:53.064]  Okay.
[01:29:53.064 --> 01:29:54.384]  Makayla in Florida.
[01:29:54.384 --> 01:29:55.425]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:29:55.425 --> 01:29:55.685]  Welcome.
[01:29:56.980 --> 01:30:03.166]  Hi, I just want to say I've been watching you since 2014 and you're so brave and you're such an inspiration.
[01:30:03.166 --> 01:30:06.290]  What can we do to wake up fellow Americans to what's going on?
[01:30:07.159 --> 01:30:09.181]  Well, Michaela, let me just say something.
[01:30:09.181 --> 01:30:10.221]  I'm not brave.
[01:30:10.221 --> 01:30:19.369]  I'd have to be stupidly brave when they're coming with forced inoculations, world government, pedophilia, total Satanism, to, like, go along with it.
[01:30:19.369 --> 01:30:30.297]  I mean, you and I, all of us are, like, together in this, like in Raiders of the Lost Ark, and the walls are closing in on us, and we're just trying to get out of this, you know?
[01:30:30.297 --> 01:30:31.878]  Yeah, I'm crying on the phone at work.
[01:30:33.902 --> 01:30:35.043]  Well, we should be crying.
[01:30:35.043 --> 01:30:35.743]  I'll be honest with you.
[01:30:35.743 --> 01:30:37.405]  I've cried for my children at night.
[01:30:37.405 --> 01:30:38.485]  I just can't help it.
[01:30:38.485 --> 01:30:39.446]  I've cried.
[01:30:39.446 --> 01:30:40.607]  And I'm not somebody that cries a lot.
[01:30:40.607 --> 01:30:42.568]  I usually cry on air and think about grandparents or something.
[01:30:42.568 --> 01:30:45.931]  But I've been having tears of concern.
[01:30:45.931 --> 01:30:47.892]  Quietly, just tears start coming out.
[01:30:47.892 --> 01:30:51.615]  I'm not sobbing, but I'm really going through grief.
[01:30:51.615 --> 01:30:53.196]  We should all be going through grief.
[01:30:53.196 --> 01:30:54.797]  We're going into a hardcore tyranny.
[01:30:54.797 --> 01:30:56.198]  We're all in grave danger.
[01:30:56.198 --> 01:30:57.940]  It says you're a medical worker.
[01:30:57.940 --> 01:30:59.741]  What's your view on the lockdown?
[01:30:59.741 --> 01:31:02.183]  I just check in patients at an MRI office.
[01:31:04.926 --> 01:31:06.646]  What is your view on all this?
[01:31:06.646 --> 01:31:07.827]  My view?
[01:31:07.827 --> 01:31:11.028]  It's over-exaggerated.
[01:31:11.028 --> 01:31:13.228]  What do the doctors and other medical workers around you think?
[01:31:13.228 --> 01:31:15.229]  What's the consensus?
[01:31:15.229 --> 01:31:17.149]  They're just taking extreme precautions.
[01:31:17.149 --> 01:31:18.630]  I feel like it's half and half.
[01:31:18.630 --> 01:31:19.870]  Some of them are buying into it.
[01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:24.211]  Some aren't.
[01:31:24.211 --> 01:31:25.571]  Well, I appreciate you calling today.
[01:31:25.571 --> 01:31:27.072]  Anything else on your mind?
[01:31:27.072 --> 01:31:28.152]  No.
[01:31:28.152 --> 01:31:30.013]  Thank you for taking my call.
[01:31:30.013 --> 01:31:30.973]  I appreciate you calling.
[01:31:31.878 --> 01:31:34.659]  And again, I said I'm not going to say thanks for calling, but then I do still say it.
[01:31:34.659 --> 01:31:35.420]  It burns up times.
[01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:36.320]  Let's just go to the callers.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.581]  I love you all.
[01:31:37.581 --> 01:31:40.522]  Angela, or no, that's Angel, in Florida.
[01:31:40.522 --> 01:31:40.982]  You're on the air.
[01:31:40.982 --> 01:31:41.702]  Go ahead.
[01:31:41.702 --> 01:31:42.383]  Good evening, Alex.
[01:31:42.383 --> 01:31:43.183]  How are you?
[01:31:43.183 --> 01:31:43.683]  Welcome, sir.
[01:31:43.683 --> 01:31:45.704]  It says you're an immigrant on the Venezuela situation.
[01:31:45.704 --> 01:31:46.404]  Go ahead.
[01:31:46.404 --> 01:31:47.525]  Yeah, man.
[01:31:47.525 --> 01:31:52.667]  I've been hearing you for some time, and I really admire you and what you're doing.
[01:31:52.667 --> 01:31:53.448]  I came to this country.
[01:31:53.448 --> 01:31:56.649]  I'm an immigrant, and I'm from Venezuela.
[01:31:56.649 --> 01:32:01.191]  And what I'm looking in my country is pretty much a pilot program for global control.
[01:32:02.043 --> 01:32:02.364]  I don't know.
[01:32:19.511 --> 01:32:22.772]  So the problem is that the United States is very hard for the U.S.
[01:32:22.772 --> 01:32:30.994]  to get in the country and help us because the Chinese are there and they don't allow anyone to come in because they have investments in the country.
[01:32:30.994 --> 01:32:38.796]  So what happens is the government is having the Chinese as a shield, protection, because now they know no one can touch them.
[01:32:38.796 --> 01:32:42.677]  And that's pretty much what is happening in the country.
[01:32:42.677 --> 01:32:43.758]  There's a lot of starvation.
[01:32:43.758 --> 01:32:45.258]  I have my family over there.
[01:32:46.082 --> 01:32:53.714]  And I've been sending food over there and the situation there, COVID-19, for them is nothing against what is going on.
[01:32:53.714 --> 01:33:00.184]  The level of starvation and people dying because they don't have access to the hospitals or anything else, no.
[01:33:00.774 --> 01:33:01.775]  No access at all.
[01:33:01.775 --> 01:33:04.017]  I mean, what is happening over there is amazing.
[01:33:04.017 --> 01:33:04.537]  It's amazing.
[01:33:04.537 --> 01:33:05.859]  People are dying every day.
[01:33:05.859 --> 01:33:07.080]  Thousands of people are dying.
[01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:08.861]  And by the way, what you're saying is accurate.
[01:33:08.861 --> 01:33:12.184]  I remember five years ago they were saying 2,000 die a week of starvation.
[01:33:12.184 --> 01:33:14.707]  I'm hearing those numbers are way up.
[01:33:14.707 --> 01:33:17.189]  The zoo animals were eaten many years ago.
[01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:21.973]  Communist China has praised your dictator Maduro.
[01:33:21.973 --> 01:33:24.916]  He's traveled to Beijing and been praised by Xi Jinping.
[01:33:25.456 --> 01:33:34.480]  And I know you're one of the richest countries resources-wise in the world, but under communism you've been stripped down to nothing, and now they're just preying on you.
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:36.001]  It's so sad.
[01:33:36.001 --> 01:33:41.743]  Yeah, I mean, we didn't have the need to immigrate to any country.
[01:33:41.743 --> 01:33:45.065]  Our country was so rich that we didn't have the need to immigrate anywhere.
[01:33:45.065 --> 01:33:49.007]  So we're the biggest diaspora right now in the whole world.
[01:33:49.007 --> 01:33:51.848]  We have more than 5 million people out of the country.
[01:33:52.461 --> 01:34:01.484]  So what I'm saying is that there's a big global elite behind this, like the Global Economic Forum and the IMF.
[01:34:01.484 --> 01:34:05.925]  The IMF is getting so much profit about all this, what is happening.
[01:34:05.925 --> 01:34:12.827]  And I remember that they are the ones that give the money or give the debts to our countries.
[01:34:12.827 --> 01:34:15.148]  And now we're like a slave for them.
[01:34:15.148 --> 01:34:20.570]  Behind everything that is happening in the US, the IMF and the Global Economic Forum is behind this.
[01:34:20.570 --> 01:34:21.510]  It's very hard.
[01:34:22.150 --> 01:34:23.330]  Hey Alex, and you know what happened?
[01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:26.271]  When you go to Europe, and you ask for what is going on in Venezuela,
[01:34:51.889 --> 01:34:55.693]  For the whole European mind, everything that is happening in Venezuela is correct.
[01:34:55.693 --> 01:34:58.236]  We have the best health system.
[01:34:58.236 --> 01:35:01.078]  We have the best leadership.
[01:35:01.078 --> 01:35:03.421]  But these people are all socialists and communists.
[01:35:03.903 --> 01:35:09.930]  And all that leadership in Europe and Asia, they praise what is happening in Venezuela.
[01:35:09.930 --> 01:35:13.414]  But what happened is that we are the model.
[01:35:13.414 --> 01:35:20.683]  We're a pilot model for them because that's exactly how they want to control the whole population by telling them what to eat and what not to eat.
[01:35:20.683 --> 01:35:22.365]  And the government is the one that gives the food.
[01:35:23.052 --> 01:35:26.935]  In fact, they make people pray to Hugo Chavez to get their school lunches.
[01:35:26.935 --> 01:35:27.755]  God bless you, Angel.
[01:35:27.755 --> 01:35:30.257]  Alright, powerful call.
[01:35:30.257 --> 01:35:37.241]  David, Casey, Sy, Jordan, Brett, Greg, Tyler, your calls are all straight ahead.
[01:35:37.241 --> 01:35:41.023]  Brett wants to make the point that all the big shops are closed and all the small ones are locked down.
[01:35:41.023 --> 01:35:42.604]  How obvious is this?
[01:35:42.604 --> 01:35:44.686]  It's a total global corporate takeover.
[01:35:44.686 --> 01:35:45.226]  We'll be right back.
[01:35:46.818 --> 01:35:53.423]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy to where it is.
[01:35:53.423 --> 01:36:09.135]  Every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months, it is going to be a death sentence to the third world, and a horrible, nightmarish collapse for the first world, and that the general public is going to go into deep, deep debt to the megabanks.
[01:36:09.135 --> 01:36:12.637]  They're not going to have medical ID cards, forced inoculations.
[01:36:12.637 --> 01:36:15.920]  We are now in a giant dystopia.
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:35.430]  But a lot of people are waking up, and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny, and we must all rediscover our Bill of Rights, rediscover our Constitution and our backbone, and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say, shut your business down, shut your life down, it'll save lives.
[01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.990]  No.
[01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:40.052]  It's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions more.
[01:36:40.052 --> 01:36:44.934]  So the cowards who went along with this with your virtue signaling, you have destroyed your lives and our lives.
[01:36:44.934 --> 01:36:45.795]  Congratulations.

[01:38:09.406 --> 01:38:14.393]  It was I, the leader of Cobra, that foresaw your inner cowardice.
[01:38:14.873 --> 01:38:16.014]  We're good to go.

[01:39:06.318 --> 01:39:07.758]  Infowarsstore.com.

[01:39:20.621 --> 01:39:22.261]  Both formulas, we're really close to selling out.
[01:39:22.261 --> 01:39:25.002]  Real Red Pill Plus, it's got some stimulant in it, natural caffeine.
[01:39:25.002 --> 01:39:26.942]  That's close to selling out, 50% off still.
[01:39:27.122 --> 01:39:33.425]  Infowarsstore.com and we're already talking to our suppliers and some of them are saying we may not take orders in a few months.
[01:39:33.425 --> 01:39:35.486]  I may not ever be able to get products again.
[01:39:35.486 --> 01:39:37.567]  Things are collapsing so bad folks.
[01:39:37.567 --> 01:39:39.208]  This is total depression.
[01:39:39.208 --> 01:39:40.849]  The infrastructure is going down.
[01:39:40.849 --> 01:39:50.693]  Get the products while you still can.
[01:39:50.693 --> 01:39:53.355]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:40:06.471 --> 01:40:14.940]  Leading a frontal assault on the lives of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:21.628]  All right, David Icke has now been unpersoned like I was two years ago.
[01:40:23.564 --> 01:40:30.566]  And I've invited him to do a show here on the weekend or whenever he wants because that's who we want on air is who's been de-platformed by Bandot Video.
[01:40:30.566 --> 01:40:31.046]  So incredible.
[01:40:31.046 --> 01:40:36.387]  We've got the press conferences that medical doctors have exposing COVID-19 as a hoax.
[01:40:36.387 --> 01:40:40.088]  We've got the videos from Cedars-Sinai that have been banned up there.
[01:40:40.088 --> 01:40:45.869]  We've got the documentary that's been banned off dozens of platforms.
[01:40:45.869 --> 01:40:48.510]  Doctors in Black up at Bandot Video.
[01:40:48.510 --> 01:40:49.470]  That's what we're doing.
[01:40:49.470 --> 01:40:51.911]  We should create a section that's Banned Films.
[01:40:52.654 --> 01:40:55.178]  Because all the films we've got are kind of scattered around.
[01:40:55.178 --> 01:40:56.940]  We should put them all in one place.
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:40:59.384]  There's so much on the site every day.
[01:40:59.384 --> 01:41:01.347]  And the site's free!
[01:41:01.347 --> 01:41:03.831]  That's why you buy the products, finances, all of this.
[01:41:03.831 --> 01:41:07.696]  And our bandwidth costs are just off the charts right now because
[01:41:09.002 --> 01:41:15.908]  As censorship explodes, people are driven to info wars now, which is not what I wanted to happen, but I knew it would happen.
[01:41:15.908 --> 01:41:17.710]  Two years ago, people said, how are you handling this?
[01:41:17.710 --> 01:41:28.740]  I said, we're going to get in place and have our own independent system of folks support us, because when it gets really bad, they make their big power move, probably with a controlled bioweapon release to bring in world government and world ID.
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:29.881]  We've got to stay on air to fight it.
[01:41:30.541 --> 01:41:34.302]  And now, here we are, inside the dystopia.
[01:41:34.302 --> 01:41:35.742]  It's not theoretical now.
[01:41:35.742 --> 01:41:40.163]  World government, forced inoculation, forced microchipping being announced.
[01:41:40.163 --> 01:41:46.045]  In Israel, in Sweden, it's all going down.
[01:41:46.045 --> 01:41:48.406]  Cy in Florida, then Tyler, then Brett.
[01:41:48.406 --> 01:41:49.646]  Cy, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:41:50.546 --> 01:41:52.227]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on.
[01:41:52.227 --> 01:41:58.712]  Listen, I just wanted to basically go over the falsifying of the numbers by the CDC and then obviously the World Health Organization.
[01:41:58.712 --> 01:42:01.013]  And then you've got all of America on house arrest.
[01:42:01.013 --> 01:42:02.174]  It's not even a quarantine, you know.
[01:42:02.174 --> 01:42:04.116]  Quarantine is for sick people.
[01:42:04.116 --> 01:42:05.477]  I wish people would get that through their head.
[01:42:05.477 --> 01:42:06.017]  Exactly!
[01:42:06.017 --> 01:42:08.899]  You usually quarantine who's sick and confirmed.
[01:42:08.899 --> 01:42:10.560]  Instead, we're all locked down.
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:12.582]  This has never been done before.
[01:42:12.582 --> 01:42:13.262]  That's right.
[01:42:13.262 --> 01:42:15.804]  And then also you've got, I mean, this is all a part of the lockstep, like you said.
[01:42:15.804 --> 01:42:17.245]  You always preach it, you know.
[01:42:17.245 --> 01:42:19.987]  All about the Rockefeller Foundation and then you've got the Bilderberg meetings.
[01:42:20.464 --> 01:42:26.088]  Listen, this is also the same people that are pushing for lockdown are the same ones pushing for everybody on a fixed income.
[01:42:26.088 --> 01:42:31.533]  You got socialism, mass inoculation of the people, the open borders, mass abortions, child sacrifice.
[01:42:31.533 --> 01:42:32.713]  I mean, the pedophilia.
[01:42:32.713 --> 01:42:33.634]  The list goes on, Alex.
[01:42:33.634 --> 01:42:34.555]  You already know.
[01:42:34.555 --> 01:42:36.356]  But, you know, it's so funny.
[01:42:36.356 --> 01:42:39.679]  Before this whole thing happened, you had the Trump rallies packed out.
[01:42:39.679 --> 01:42:42.881]  And now, you know, you've got people, you know, vying for everything.
[01:42:42.881 --> 01:42:46.304]  Let's just shoot it over to Zoom and have everybody speak online.
[01:42:46.304 --> 01:42:47.305]  I just think it's very funny.
[01:42:51.607 --> 01:42:54.568]  Switching the train from one train to the other, teaching you.
[01:42:54.568 --> 01:42:55.829]  You don't go out and get a job.
[01:42:55.829 --> 01:42:57.269]  You don't go out and start a business.
[01:42:57.269 --> 01:43:00.250]  You work for us, but you're obsolete.
[01:43:00.250 --> 01:43:02.651]  People need to understand this is an admitted trap.
[01:43:02.651 --> 01:43:07.753]  And the Democrats and the Hollywood scum have jumped the gun.
[01:43:07.753 --> 01:43:10.534]  They're admitting, oh, this is good for the earth.
[01:43:10.534 --> 01:43:12.815]  It's good that the old economy is going away.
[01:43:12.815 --> 01:43:14.876]  Well, how obvious is that, my friend?
[01:43:14.876 --> 01:43:16.537]  How do you think it's going for them, Cy?
[01:43:17.543 --> 01:43:19.584]  Yeah, and now you can see everybody's true colors.
[01:43:19.584 --> 01:43:21.106]  Each state's a little bit different, you know.
[01:43:21.106 --> 01:43:24.208]  They put in a certain governor, and now you see whose side they're on.
[01:43:24.208 --> 01:43:27.530]  So it's really, actually, and a lot of this is about a lot of good things for life.
[01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:32.453]  But you've got, you know, people like even the FBI and the CIA, they're on both sides, you know, operations.
[01:43:32.453 --> 01:43:37.577]  So, I mean, just to see, it's really, it's really not even about a Republican and a Democrat anymore.
[01:43:37.577 --> 01:43:39.718]  It's a fight between light and darkness.
[01:43:39.718 --> 01:43:43.161]  Well, that's right, and everybody in the agencies and the corporations have to understand
[01:43:44.426 --> 01:43:46.047]  Governments are going to be made obsolete.
[01:43:46.047 --> 01:43:47.769]  The family's being made obsolete.
[01:43:47.769 --> 01:43:50.571]  You can pretend you're going along with this to be in charge.
[01:43:50.571 --> 01:43:52.313]  You're a schmuck if you do that.
[01:43:52.313 --> 01:43:53.594]  We have to resist this.
[01:43:53.594 --> 01:43:55.155]  This is an anti-human takeover.
[01:43:55.155 --> 01:43:56.737]  Cy, great points.
[01:43:56.737 --> 01:43:59.219]  Tyler in Arizona says his wife's a nurse.
[01:43:59.219 --> 01:44:01.321]  Tell us what's going on, Tyler.
[01:44:01.321 --> 01:44:03.302]  Alex, what a pleasure to talk to you, Bob.
[01:44:03.302 --> 01:44:04.363]  Yeah, my wife is a nurse.
[01:44:04.363 --> 01:44:08.867]  She's pregnant, about six months pregnant with my second child, a little girl coming out.
[01:44:08.867 --> 01:44:11.349]  It's going to be really interesting to see how that unfolds.
[01:44:13.072 --> 01:44:22.196]  You know, that being said, she's taken standby, which is, you know, leaving, you know, you get to leave without pay or however, just, you know, you take the day off.
[01:44:22.196 --> 01:44:37.963]  She's taken standby three, four, maybe five times since this pandemic's come off, and that's because they were exactly like you predicted, slowly but surely furloughing and laying off their employees because they weren't having the income rate, because the hospitals are slow and empty.
[01:44:42.418 --> 01:44:42.959]  Absolutely.
[01:44:42.959 --> 01:44:45.801]  Remember a few months ago, we'd show all the footage of the empty hospitals.
[01:44:45.801 --> 01:44:46.742]  They said it was a lie.
[01:44:46.742 --> 01:44:49.905]  We showed the footage that looked like fake hazmat gear crews.
[01:44:49.905 --> 01:44:53.688]  And it turns out those very hospitals were staging events with CBS News.
[01:44:53.688 --> 01:44:58.493]  I mean, how long can the media get caught staging things?
[01:44:58.493 --> 01:45:00.014]  As long as we let them, boss.
[01:45:00.014 --> 01:45:01.515]  Now, what was the president that said?
[01:45:01.515 --> 01:45:03.677]  I think it was James Madison.
[01:45:03.677 --> 01:45:05.659]  He said, how long, how far would tyranny go?
[01:45:05.659 --> 01:45:06.540]  As far as we let them go.
[01:45:08.188 --> 01:45:08.869]  That's it, brother.
[01:45:08.869 --> 01:45:09.450]  God bless you.
[01:45:09.450 --> 01:45:10.953]  I appreciate your call.
[01:45:10.953 --> 01:45:12.997]  Senator Rand Paul just put out a tweet.
[01:45:12.997 --> 01:45:13.778]  Oh, look!
[01:45:13.778 --> 01:45:18.126]  The anti-real Donald Trump Deep State just signed their names to a public letter.
[01:45:18.126 --> 01:45:19.608]  ABC News, Justice Department.
[01:45:20.472 --> 01:45:43.239]  Nearly 2,000 Justice Department officials have signed onto a letter calling for Attorney General William Barr to resign over what they describe as an improper intervention in the criminal case of former Trump National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, who did nothing wrong, who they said they were targeting to get fired, who they then set up and threatened to put his son in prison if he didn't plead guilty to a crime he didn't commit.
[01:45:43.239 --> 01:45:46.520]  And these 2,000 criminals, commanded by Comey and Obama in the deep state,
[01:45:48.206 --> 01:45:50.874]  Are the list of the people that need to have their asses fired.
[01:45:50.874 --> 01:45:53.381]  Nearly 2,000 former DOJ officials called for A.G.
[01:45:53.381 --> 01:45:55.607]  Barr to resign over Flynn case.
[01:45:55.607 --> 01:45:56.189]  ABC News.
[01:45:58.417 --> 01:46:00.718]  Unbelievable.
[01:46:00.718 --> 01:46:02.740]  They've just started fighting, folks.
[01:46:02.740 --> 01:46:03.840]  They're not going to give up.
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:04.821]  They're CHICOM-funded.
[01:46:04.821 --> 01:46:06.542]  They've committed so many crimes.
[01:46:06.542 --> 01:46:09.224]  They're totally committed to bringing this country down.
[01:46:09.224 --> 01:46:10.264]  They're not FBI agents.
[01:46:10.264 --> 01:46:11.985]  They're not just department officials.
[01:46:11.985 --> 01:46:12.806]  They're globalists.
[01:46:12.806 --> 01:46:14.967]  The globalists want America gone.
[01:46:14.967 --> 01:46:16.568]  They want a depression.
[01:46:16.568 --> 01:46:26.174]  Everybody out there in private life, in corporations, in the government, you better decide right now which side you're on, and you better be heard!
[01:46:26.174 --> 01:46:26.854]  It's that simple.
[01:46:30.060 --> 01:46:31.141]  And again, you can't argue with me.
[01:46:31.141 --> 01:46:34.342]  I'm dressed like Bill Gates in a non-threatening pink sweater.
[01:46:34.342 --> 01:46:36.063]  So even though I'm going to eat my neighbors, it's okay.
[01:46:36.063 --> 01:46:37.764]  I'm wearing a pink sweater.
[01:46:37.764 --> 01:46:38.405]  Eat your neighbors?
[01:46:38.405 --> 01:46:41.526]  Again, that's Jonathan Swift.
[01:46:41.526 --> 01:46:42.347]  Modest proposal.
[01:46:42.347 --> 01:46:44.248]  Don't want to really eat the neighbors.
[01:46:44.248 --> 01:46:45.749]  I want the collapse to stop.
[01:46:45.749 --> 01:46:47.249]  It is causing mass death.
[01:46:47.249 --> 01:46:52.112]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Brett in Chicago.
[01:46:52.112 --> 01:46:52.912]  You're on the air, Brett.
[01:46:52.912 --> 01:46:53.673]  Thank you.
[01:46:53.673 --> 01:46:55.374]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:46:56.161 --> 01:47:00.403]  Man, I am just seeing everything we knew they were building behind the scenes emerge.
[01:47:00.403 --> 01:47:02.143]  I knew exactly what they do.
[01:47:02.143 --> 01:47:08.186]  So, I mean, it's not a surprise, but it still is a surprise because I can't believe they're really that evil, brother.
[01:47:08.186 --> 01:47:09.066]  Oh, they are that evil.
[01:47:09.066 --> 01:47:09.726]  Think about it.
[01:47:09.726 --> 01:47:12.588]  So, I guess two things I want to get across here.
[01:47:12.588 --> 01:47:18.770]  The one thing in Chicago, you know, you look at the Walmart, there's no social distancing at all going on there.
[01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:20.531]  They're letting people in by the herd.
[01:47:20.531 --> 01:47:21.131]  You know what I'm saying?
[01:47:22.178 --> 01:47:28.584]  It's insane, you know, and then you got the local mom posh shops down the street, and they're closed down.
[01:47:28.584 --> 01:47:31.107]  Sir, 15,000 people a day fly into the UK.
[01:47:31.107 --> 01:47:33.469]  Over 50,000 drive in.
[01:47:33.469 --> 01:47:34.350]  The Channel.
[01:47:34.350 --> 01:47:36.312]  No one's being checked!
[01:47:36.312 --> 01:47:37.633]  But you can't leave your house!
[01:47:37.633 --> 01:47:40.956]  They'll grab a woman and slam her head in the ground.
[01:47:40.956 --> 01:47:43.499]  But you can fly in all you want.
[01:47:43.499 --> 01:47:44.600]  It's a hoax.
[01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:46.822]  You can fly from Wuhan to London.
[01:47:48.393 --> 01:47:52.558]  And all, it's in the news that the British police won't mess with you if you're Asian.
[01:47:52.558 --> 01:47:56.041]  But if you're white, you're done because you're there to be taught you're scum.
[01:47:56.041 --> 01:47:57.383]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:47:57.383 --> 01:48:01.387]  And then the mayor of Chicago wants to say she's gonna, she's gonna prosecute us.
[01:48:01.387 --> 01:48:03.249]  We're criminals, we're this, we're that.
[01:48:03.249 --> 01:48:05.812]  But then she gets caught going to an illegal hair salon.
[01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:07.710]  Exactly, right?
[01:48:07.710 --> 01:48:11.152]  And then, but of course, you know, let's open up Walmart.
[01:48:11.152 --> 01:48:13.353]  Everyone shop at Walmart, Walmart, Walmart.
[01:48:13.353 --> 01:48:15.834]  Big corporations, big corporations.
[01:48:15.834 --> 01:48:18.475]  Yeah, they're waging war against small mom and pops.
[01:48:18.475 --> 01:48:22.456]  That's why in the future, I used to go to the grocery store, the regular one.
[01:48:22.456 --> 01:48:27.838]  I've told my wife, and she agreed with me, I said, let's just practice going to this little bodega down the street.
[01:48:27.838 --> 01:48:32.260]  It costs more because they can't scale up, but let's try to just eat food out of there.
[01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:34.141]  And so we've stopped going to the big grocery stores.
[01:48:35.021 --> 01:48:40.004]  I mean, I never go and target Hardly Ever or Walmart, but now I'm done with all of them.
[01:48:40.004 --> 01:48:44.527]  I'm done with all chains, all big hotels, all the big establishments.
[01:48:44.527 --> 01:48:45.648]  You want to wage war on me?
[01:48:45.648 --> 01:48:46.869]  I wage war on you!
[01:48:49.463 --> 01:48:52.025]  Oh, he's super creepy and super evil.
[01:49:17.645 --> 01:49:22.026]  He's up there telling college commitments, commencements, where there's no people.
[01:49:22.026 --> 01:49:23.507]  You know, you are the chosen ones.
[01:49:23.507 --> 01:49:25.287]  You're like World War combat vets.
[01:49:25.287 --> 01:49:26.708]  You survived this.
[01:49:26.708 --> 01:49:29.468]  And it's all a giant hoax on record.
[01:49:29.468 --> 01:49:32.069]  We must expose the hoax or be totally enslaved.
[01:49:32.069 --> 01:49:33.470]  This is their big play.
[01:49:33.470 --> 01:49:34.530]  This is their big move.
[01:49:34.530 --> 01:49:35.230]  They use fear.
[01:49:35.230 --> 01:49:36.010]  They use control.
[01:49:36.010 --> 01:49:37.191]  They use compliance.
[01:49:37.191 --> 01:49:38.351]  We must say no, Brett.
[01:49:38.351 --> 01:49:39.831]  God bless you.
[01:49:39.831 --> 01:49:40.252]  All right.
[01:49:40.252 --> 01:49:44.293]  I got David and I got Casey and I got Bob and I got Mike and I got Greg and I got Ryan.
[01:49:44.293 --> 01:49:45.053]  I want to get to all of you.
[01:49:45.780 --> 01:49:49.162]  David Icke says he can only do an hour with us.
[01:49:49.162 --> 01:49:53.704]  And I also have this Bill Gates piece that we put together that I want to play.
[01:49:53.704 --> 01:49:59.446]  And we have a very special video that I'm going to premiere at 6 after in the fourth hour.
[01:49:59.446 --> 01:50:00.267]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[01:50:00.267 --> 01:50:02.248]  Believe me, it's important.
[01:50:02.248 --> 01:50:03.408]  But what I'm going to do is I'm going to go to break.
[01:50:03.408 --> 01:50:09.671]  I'm going to come back and jam a few more calls in this next segment ahead of David Icke.
[01:50:10.814 --> 01:50:17.397]  And again, if you're a TV viewer, I'm wearing a pink Bill Gates shirt, which means you can trust me.
[01:50:17.397 --> 01:50:19.898]  Now, the vaccine's gonna kill 700,000 people.
[01:50:19.898 --> 01:50:21.759]  He admitted that, or maimed them.
[01:50:21.759 --> 01:50:22.559]  But it's okay.
[01:50:22.559 --> 01:50:25.060]  I'm wearing a pink shirt.
[01:50:25.060 --> 01:50:26.821]  And Bill Gates can't argue with me either.
[01:50:26.821 --> 01:50:29.422]  Bill Gates, you're a eugenicist, you're a criminal.
[01:50:29.422 --> 01:50:30.042]  You can't argue.
[01:50:30.042 --> 01:50:31.983]  I'm not threatening wearing a pink shirt.
[01:50:31.983 --> 01:50:32.924]  You see?
[01:50:32.924 --> 01:50:35.565]  Only one thing trumps Gates, and that's a pink shirt.
[01:50:36.949 --> 01:50:43.916]  Feudalism in the ancient world, from Asia to Europe, from Africa to Latin America, was the most common form of government.
[01:50:43.916 --> 01:50:52.485]  You had a ruling class, the nobility, with a king and queen sitting on top of it, and the rest of the public were kept at a subsistence, starving level.
[01:50:53.246 --> 01:50:54.907]  For control.
[01:50:54.907 --> 01:51:06.390]  In fact, in most cultures, they called the peasants the little people because they were usually a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them, again, at a starving level.
[01:51:06.390 --> 01:51:10.792]  They were so busy trying to survive, they would never try to challenge the entrenched elite.
[01:51:11.172 --> 01:51:28.398]  Well, now all the big Google owners and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, the Jeff Bezoses of the world, they're sitting back on their giant estates with their jet helicopters and private jets, living the life, laughing at you, shut down, going bankrupt in the third world, starving to death.
[01:51:28.398 --> 01:51:34.179]  Their religion is power and control, and they are pressing that advantage against us.
[01:51:34.179 --> 01:51:35.840]  We must break free from these monsters.
[01:51:37.808 --> 01:51:45.553]  InfoWars has become a symbol, an emblem, of not just American freedom, but worldwide maverick spirit.
[01:51:45.553 --> 01:51:50.396]  It's not just myself or the host at InfoWars, or the researchers, or the journalists.
[01:51:50.396 --> 01:51:54.918]  It's you, the listeners, the activists, the people on the front lines, in the arena.
[01:51:54.918 --> 01:51:59.081]  And it's the amazing guests and individuals that we interviewed.
[01:51:59.401 --> 01:52:03.888]  They make InfoWars so special because we're not putting a filter in front of free minds.
[01:52:03.888 --> 01:52:14.845]  We're having an open discussion about the real state of the world, not the establishment talking points that are put out by the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group, Davos Group, and other globalists.
[01:52:15.465 --> 01:52:23.629]  We're pushing for a pro-human future where we build a planet and beyond based on humans, for humans, by humans.
[01:52:23.629 --> 01:52:30.833]  Not a world where the establishment, who hate themselves, project their hate onto us and decide we're going to have a post-human world.
[01:52:30.833 --> 01:52:40.658]  I'm really excited to know that InfoWars has your support and I want to thank you all for being pro-human and pro-God.
[01:52:40.658 --> 01:52:43.300]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:52:51.454 --> 01:53:08.564]  And just like that, world governments announced forced inoculations and plentiful microchips, tracer teams to come inspect your home, mothers having their children pulled out of their arms, screaming and crying, taken away to prison camps because they dared go out on the street.
[01:53:08.564 --> 01:53:12.947]  Oh, but the borders are open and the flights are wide open, and the tunnel
[01:53:14.150 --> 01:53:18.633]  I was at the Walmart just now, and you know how they have the cattle guards out and the little
[01:53:42.475 --> 01:53:47.738]  The people with their masks on and their little tablets?
[01:53:47.738 --> 01:53:47.958]  Yes.
[01:53:47.958 --> 01:53:52.241]  Well, I asked the guy, I said, hey, I said, what are you doing with that tablet there?
[01:53:52.241 --> 01:53:57.564]  Are you checking to, are you marking down whether people have masks on or not?
[01:53:57.564 --> 01:54:00.366]  And he said, actually, yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[01:54:00.366 --> 01:54:02.047]  I said, well, who gets that information?
[01:54:02.047 --> 01:54:04.148]  Well, it goes to corporate.
[01:54:04.148 --> 01:54:10.492]  And then I'd assume corporate's giving it to the CDC and the National Health Institute.
[01:54:10.492 --> 01:54:11.333]  I said, oh, really?
[01:54:11.957 --> 01:54:13.697]  Well, that's good to know.
[01:54:13.697 --> 01:54:17.298]  I said, why don't you tell Bill Gates to kiss my you-know-what?
[01:54:17.298 --> 01:54:20.098]  And why don't you tell corporate to knock this off?
[01:54:20.098 --> 01:54:22.779]  And, uh, because it's like, it's communism.
[01:54:22.779 --> 01:54:24.679]  This is like the beginning of communism.
[01:54:24.679 --> 01:54:29.000]  Well, what it really is is the merger of the government and corporations is fascism.
[01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:29.480]  But you're right.
[01:54:29.480 --> 01:54:30.640]  They call it communism.
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:32.901]  It's communist nomenclature at the grassroots.
[01:54:32.901 --> 01:54:35.901]  But it's really corporate fascism sitting up on top of it.
[01:54:35.901 --> 01:54:37.002]  Thank you so much, David.
[01:54:37.002 --> 01:54:38.042]  God bless you.
[01:54:38.042 --> 01:54:39.162]  Shoot video of it next time.
[01:54:41.095 --> 01:54:45.298]  Again, Walmart already de-industrialized and shut down our farming communities.
[01:54:45.298 --> 01:54:49.340]  And now they're leveraging their power, and big tech's leveraging their power to surveil us.
[01:54:49.340 --> 01:54:51.121]  They were always gonna abuse it.
[01:54:51.121 --> 01:54:54.023]  And now that they think they've got enough power, they're censoring everybody.
[01:54:54.023 --> 01:54:57.225]  Medical doctors, scientists.
[01:54:57.225 --> 01:55:00.307]  There's all these medical doctors, all these scientists.
[01:55:00.307 --> 01:55:05.611]  Hamburg, the head coroner's come out and said, everybody dying has two or three deadly diseases.
[01:55:05.611 --> 01:55:07.492]  The average age is 80.
[01:55:07.492 --> 01:55:08.693]  YouTube took that video down.
[01:55:09.790 --> 01:55:11.511]  Another doctor stood up at a rally in L.A.
[01:55:11.511 --> 01:55:12.812]  last week, said it's all fraud.
[01:55:12.812 --> 01:55:15.154]  They took that video down.
[01:55:15.154 --> 01:55:17.836]  Cedars-Sinai said Trump was right about light therapy.
[01:55:17.836 --> 01:55:19.617]  Cedars-Sinai can't talk!
[01:55:19.617 --> 01:55:20.358]  Only the U.N.
[01:55:20.358 --> 01:55:25.161]  and Bill and Melinda Gates and John Hopkins that all cooked up the fraud together.
[01:55:25.161 --> 01:55:28.263]  Click just like that, you're inside The Trap as David Icke is joining us.
[01:55:28.263 --> 01:55:30.785]  The next segment is Trailblazing Exposed.
[01:55:30.785 --> 01:55:32.527]  Bob in Florida, you're on the air worldwide.
[01:55:32.527 --> 01:55:33.507]  Go ahead.
[01:55:33.507 --> 01:55:33.868]  Hey, buddy.
[01:55:33.868 --> 01:55:34.388]  How you doing?
[01:55:35.515 --> 01:55:38.736]  Hey listen, I've been thinking about this.
[01:55:38.736 --> 01:55:44.018]  The hospital's taking money for the COVID payments for patients.
[01:55:44.018 --> 01:55:50.540]  So they get to what, the $13,000 if they label a patient as COVID and then they get the $39,000 if they put a ventilator tube in them?
[01:55:52.202 --> 01:56:01.290]  Yes, and then if they have so many, depending on the size of the hospital, they get millions of dollars, hundreds of thousands to millions, depending if they shut their hospital down and just make it about COVID.
[01:56:01.290 --> 01:56:04.253]  That's why they're all empty, because there's not that many COVID patients.
[01:56:04.253 --> 01:56:13.281]  So then they incentivize to say everyone coming in has COVID, which the main test they've done in about 90% of the cases, just test for genetic material that almost everyone has in it.
[01:56:13.281 --> 01:56:14.543]  That's why the Tanzanian president
[01:56:15.438 --> 01:56:18.299]  Well, my question is, where is that money coming from?
[01:56:18.299 --> 01:56:19.259]  Who's coughing up that money?
[01:56:39.022 --> 01:56:42.625]  But doesn't that make the hospitals complicit in the cover-up?
[01:56:42.625 --> 01:56:45.226]  Sir, it is a massive criminal conspiracy.
[01:56:45.226 --> 01:56:48.088]  And I gotta say, red states are corrupt, but nothing compared to blue.
[01:56:48.088 --> 01:56:50.930]  You notice almost all the deaths are like in New York.
[01:56:50.930 --> 01:56:53.772]  But that's because New York is just so corrupt it'll make your head spin.
[01:56:53.772 --> 01:56:54.573]  No one denies that.
[01:56:54.573 --> 01:56:55.694]  It is a cesspit of evil.
[01:56:55.694 --> 01:56:58.716]  A lot of good folks live there, but the people in charge are evil.
[01:56:58.716 --> 01:57:01.478]  They are listing everyone that dies as COVID.
[01:57:01.478 --> 01:57:05.621]  And Project Veritas has funeral homeowners and others confirming it, and nurses.
[01:57:06.966 --> 01:57:12.809]  And CBS just got caught staging people coming in and staging vehicles.
[01:57:12.809 --> 01:57:14.830]  We reported that two months ago.
[01:57:14.830 --> 01:57:19.612]  And I got a threatening phone call from some folks saying, we're gonna sue you.
[01:57:19.612 --> 01:57:21.312]  You claim our hospital's doing that.
[01:57:21.312 --> 01:57:24.214]  Turns out it was fake at that hospital.
[01:57:24.214 --> 01:57:25.814]  So it's just because people be out front.
[01:57:25.814 --> 01:57:27.475]  They noticed no one would be there for days.
[01:57:27.475 --> 01:57:31.757]  All of a sudden, 20 people in hazmat suits and a line of cars for the media.
[01:57:31.757 --> 01:57:34.959]  And the same people were going in and out in circles.
[01:57:34.959 --> 01:57:35.419]  David Icke.
[01:57:36.513 --> 01:57:38.135]  Make a friend with death.
[01:57:38.135 --> 01:57:40.697]  It's a saying so old that no one knows who first said it.
[01:57:40.697 --> 01:57:42.179]  Every culture has their own way of...
[01:57:55.031 --> 01:58:03.854]  Memorializing that simple statement, but you don't want to make a friend of the death of civilization and the death of the human species.
[01:58:03.854 --> 01:58:06.314]  The moment of truth is now here.
[01:58:06.314 --> 01:58:17.298]  We are facing the post-human era, and I've been warning you for many years that they would use a global viral crisis to click, put us in the cage, and then roll out the robot takeover.
[01:58:18.158 --> 01:58:20.759]  This is just the beta test.
[01:58:20.759 --> 01:58:25.221]  China's moving out of beta and into operational control.
[01:58:25.221 --> 01:58:29.603]  In just a few years, we will be under full globalist control.
[01:58:29.603 --> 01:58:32.004]  Forced inoculations, total surveillance.
[01:58:32.004 --> 01:58:34.785]  We're all being taught that we are obsolete.
[01:58:34.785 --> 01:58:37.926]  The term they use is non-essential.
[01:58:37.926 --> 01:58:40.267]  This is not some dystopian novel.
[01:58:40.267 --> 01:58:41.808]  This is reality.
[01:58:41.808 --> 01:58:43.848]  This is the New World Order.
[01:58:43.848 --> 01:58:45.209]  This is Satanism.
[01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.798]  Yeah.
[01:59:08.593 --> 01:59:11.215]  Let's hear from Boris Johnson last night.
[01:59:11.215 --> 01:59:13.396]  That's the first thing that David Icke wants to get into.
[01:59:13.396 --> 01:59:22.081]  Announcing a national tracking code system for COVID-19 and other diseases into the future and when you're allowed to leave your home.
[01:59:22.081 --> 01:59:27.124]  A national poll says 90% of Britons don't ever want to leave their houses again.
[01:59:27.124 --> 01:59:28.845]  Here it is.
[01:59:28.845 --> 01:59:35.628]  It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom.
[01:59:35.628 --> 01:59:36.209]  Your freedom.
[01:59:36.929 --> 01:59:41.312]  Of a kind that we have never seen before in peace or war.
[01:59:41.312 --> 01:59:45.776]  And you have shown the good sense to support those rules overwhelmingly.
[01:59:45.776 --> 02:00:02.929]  You've put up with all the hardships of that programme of social distancing because you understand that as things stand, and as the experience of every other country has shown, it's the only way to defeat the coronavirus, the most vicious threat this country has faced in my lifetime.
[02:00:03.999 --> 02:00:19.627]  And though the death toll has been tragic and the suffering immense, and though we grieve for all those we have lost, it is a fact that by adopting those measures we prevented this country from being engulfed by what could
[02:00:20.888 --> 02:00:25.689]  So they took everybody's rights away and kept us all from being engulfed by mass death.
[02:00:25.689 --> 02:00:29.550]  So doesn't matter the projections were 50 times, 30 times, 20 times off.
[02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:33.652]  Doesn't matter it was all fraud and they're counting all the regular deaths as COVID-19.
[02:00:33.652 --> 02:00:37.713]  Oh no, no, them taking all your rights is the reason they weren't completely engulfed.
[02:00:37.713 --> 02:00:45.755]  But now it's a permanent emergency and there's this, the big tech companies already have the apps that are going to track you in real time and right where David
[02:00:46.635 --> 02:00:49.896]  Ike lives in the UK, that's where they first are pilot testing it.
[02:00:49.896 --> 02:00:57.618]  So David, you've been a very busy man after being banned off Facebook, being banned off of YouTube for refusing to stay silent.
[02:00:57.618 --> 02:01:03.340]  But you were saying this months ago, you've been vindicated by all the doctors and scientists and epidemiologists and...
[02:01:03.860 --> 02:01:18.032]  Coroners coming out and saying, you're absolutely right, no one's dying of COVID, they just are infected with something like COVID, a coronavirus, and so they're attributing basically anybody that's ever had a cold to coronavirus when they die.
[02:01:18.032 --> 02:01:27.701]  Yeah, I mean, that statement last night from Boris Johnson, unfortunately I missed the last part because I was throwing up at the time.
[02:01:28.507 --> 02:01:31.608]  I mean, talk about a lie-fest.
[02:01:31.608 --> 02:01:38.091]  It was absolutely sickening and cynical beyond belief.
[02:01:38.091 --> 02:01:53.717]  He's locked down Britain, as other countries like America have been locked down, on the basis of totally fraudulent computer models by a guy called Neil Ferguson at Imperial College in London.
[02:01:53.717 --> 02:01:55.818]  And no one's going to tell me, Alex,
[02:01:56.852 --> 02:02:17.263]  That given that his paymaster, Bill Gates, wanted lockdowns as part of this whole strategy of vaccination and destroying people's livelihoods and making them dependent on the state, there's no way that he produced the
[02:02:18.951 --> 02:02:24.575]  Catastrophic, if they were true, projections which cause lockdown.
[02:02:24.575 --> 02:02:28.138]  Half a million people will die in Britain if there's no lockdown.
[02:02:28.138 --> 02:02:29.619]  Two million in America.
[02:02:29.619 --> 02:02:34.522]  There's no way he did that by chance or by accident.
[02:02:34.522 --> 02:02:39.286]  He was producing what was necessary to make that happen.
[02:02:39.286 --> 02:02:43.849]  And what is sickening after all these weeks of lockdown and destroyed lives
[02:02:44.881 --> 02:02:57.405]  Um, is that last night and still today in the houses of Parliament, Johnson was still saying that without the lockdown, up to half a million people in Britain could have died.
[02:02:57.405 --> 02:02:59.246]  It's absolutely sickening.
[02:02:59.246 --> 02:03:03.247]  And that guy has to go because he's overseen
[02:03:04.289 --> 02:03:24.265]  The destruction of this country and goodness knows how vast numbers of people are going to recover from this because he's doing what I've been saying he would do for weeks and that is roll it back a little bit because the pressure is starting to push the other way but
[02:03:25.288 --> 02:03:28.069]  As little as he can get away with, and that's what's happening.
[02:03:28.069 --> 02:03:43.797]  And this slight easing that he's announced has the rider, which he keeps emphasising, that if the numbers go up again, and of course they're fixing the bloody figures so they can make them go up as much as they like and down when they like.
[02:03:43.797 --> 02:03:49.680]  If it goes up again, then he'll have to go back into the lockdown as it was before.
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:54.242]  So how can businesses, even as they're trying to recover from this catastrophe,
[02:03:54.904 --> 02:03:59.374]  Make any plans and commit any money, any investment.
[02:04:00.299 --> 02:04:05.703]  When they don't know if they're going to put the telly on tomorrow and see it's gone back to lockdown.
[02:04:05.703 --> 02:04:09.046]  And David, I want to go over that, but you said it three months ago.
[02:04:09.046 --> 02:04:09.946]  I said it three months ago.
[02:04:09.946 --> 02:04:13.069]  I'm not bragging, but you and I were the ones that were dead on about this.
[02:04:13.069 --> 02:04:15.270]  This is clearly the post-human takeover.
[02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:20.094]  Hollywood now admits that we want to save the earth, the whole green agenda.
[02:04:20.094 --> 02:04:26.959]  They're now admitting that this is a way to devastate the average public, get us dependent, get us on the dole, so they can dictate
[02:04:27.319 --> 02:04:27.940]  Well, the idea is to
[02:04:47.618 --> 02:04:50.940]  Roll it back, but as little as they can get away with.
[02:04:50.940 --> 02:05:03.967]  And having set the precedent of the lockdown, when the second wave comes, which, because they're fixing the figures, they can make happen when they like or appear to, then they'll go straight back into lockdown.
[02:05:03.967 --> 02:05:15.113]  And the big thing, I think you covered it on your show as well, the big thing that they want in this next phase is control of food.
[02:05:16.136 --> 02:05:17.597]  Control of people's incomes.
[02:05:17.597 --> 02:05:20.199]  Well, they've got that for vast numbers of people.
[02:05:20.199 --> 02:05:21.981]  But control of food as well.
[02:05:21.981 --> 02:05:32.229]  Controlling all the necessities of life, which, if you want them, will dangle you a bit, but you have to do exactly what we say.
[02:05:32.229 --> 02:05:35.471]  And this is what it's all about.
[02:05:35.471 --> 02:05:41.216]  And Johnson is just fronting up for the dark suits, because
[02:05:42.549 --> 02:05:46.147]  Democracy in Britain, as in other countries around the world, has been suspended.
[02:05:46.883 --> 02:05:51.725]  The Dark Suits, who've never seen a ballot box in their life, they're the ones who are driving it.
[02:05:51.725 --> 02:05:55.207]  The medical technocrats, the science technocrats.
[02:05:55.207 --> 02:06:04.871]  And they are advancing agenda in cohorts with Bill Gates, who owns most of them, financially.
[02:06:04.871 --> 02:06:09.234]  And by the way, it's so obvious now, Bill Gates has been destroyed online.
[02:06:09.234 --> 02:06:12.015]  Every tweet, every article that attempts to prop him up is just
[02:06:12.595 --> 02:06:14.156]  Flamed with the truth.
[02:06:14.156 --> 02:06:21.579]  So there does seem to be the inverse here way beyond a silver lining here that there's a humongous awakening.
[02:06:21.579 --> 02:06:25.821]  Well, that's that's why I've been every time I've had an opportunity.
[02:06:25.821 --> 02:06:27.422]  I've been focusing it on Gates.
[02:06:28.163 --> 02:06:30.244]  Because Gates is the key.
[02:06:30.244 --> 02:06:33.724]  If you can discredit Gates, and my God, how easy is that?
[02:06:33.724 --> 02:06:37.385]  Then you can discredit the vaccination which Gates is pushing.
[02:06:37.385 --> 02:06:44.047]  And, you know, you've mentioned I've just been deleted from Facebook and deleted from YouTube.
[02:06:44.047 --> 02:06:45.548]  And this is how it's working.
[02:06:45.548 --> 02:06:47.628]  Real simple.
[02:06:47.628 --> 02:06:50.889]  Gates controls the World Health Organization.
[02:06:50.889 --> 02:06:54.450]  Ted Ross, the Director General, is a former Gates employee.
[02:06:55.496 --> 02:07:00.879]  Tedros was on the board of Gavi, the vaccine alliance funded into existence by Gates.
[02:07:00.879 --> 02:07:02.940]  It's very much involved in all this.
[02:07:02.940 --> 02:07:22.270]  So what they do is they say, OK, the World Health Organization, created by the Rockefellers originally, of course, is the centre of knowledge and the centre of all statements and truth about this alleged virus.
[02:07:22.270 --> 02:07:23.051]  And it is alleged.
[02:07:23.763 --> 02:07:40.645]  And then what happens on the other side of the world, or on the other side of America, in Silicon Valley, is these internet giants controlled by the same people and the forces that control the World Health Organization, people like
[02:07:42.848 --> 02:07:46.971]  Susan Wojcicki at YouTube and Zuckerberg at Facebook.
[02:07:46.971 --> 02:08:00.538]  They then say we're going to censor anyone who is challenging, questioning, or exposing... And by the way, including prestigious medical doctors, major hospital heads, and what's crazy is now...
[02:08:01.997 --> 02:08:07.259]  Zuckerberg works directly under Gates and admits he takes orders from him and wears the same pink sweater.
[02:08:07.259 --> 02:08:08.740]  That's why I wore this pink sweater today.
[02:08:08.740 --> 02:08:14.362]  Did you wear your pink sweater in the last London Reel as an ode to Bill Gates, a little non-threatening pink sweater?
[02:08:15.421 --> 02:08:26.310]  Well, no, but this connection between Silicon Valley and the World Health Organization can never be more blatant.
[02:08:26.310 --> 02:08:36.198]  To actually come out, as Wojcicki has at YouTube, and say we are going to censor that which challenges the World Health Organization, what it means is
[02:08:36.937 --> 02:08:39.498]  The United Nations is in control of what we can say already.
[02:08:39.498 --> 02:08:40.699]  We're already under UN control.
[02:08:40.699 --> 02:08:41.960]  David, I'd stay right there.
[02:08:41.960 --> 02:08:43.981]  In fact, cue up that clip of Wachowski, folks.
[02:08:43.981 --> 02:08:48.544]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history.
[02:08:48.544 --> 02:08:51.585]  The globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off.
[02:08:51.585 --> 02:08:54.727]  And they're like, yeah, you're taking implantable chips.
[02:08:54.727 --> 02:08:56.508]  Yeah, we're into pedophilia.
[02:08:56.508 --> 02:08:58.289]  Yeah, we're into world government.
[02:08:58.289 --> 02:09:00.150]  Yeah, you're obsolete.
[02:09:00.150 --> 02:09:01.211]  You are non-essential.
[02:09:02.171 --> 02:09:03.992]  We are shutting your ass down.
[02:09:03.992 --> 02:09:08.856]  Yeah, we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore.
[02:09:08.856 --> 02:09:10.517]  You're going to be the service economy.
[02:09:10.517 --> 02:09:15.900]  And now the globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy and you're obsolete.
[02:09:15.900 --> 02:09:21.044]  So you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance income so they can dictate your life.
[02:09:21.604 --> 02:09:24.225]  The handcuffs are going on right now.
[02:09:24.225 --> 02:09:26.905]  We have to resist and say no to the New World Order.
[02:09:26.905 --> 02:09:29.586]  And that takes you understanding you were right.
[02:09:29.586 --> 02:09:31.086]  And understanding I was right.
[02:09:31.086 --> 02:09:35.808]  And getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can.
[02:09:35.808 --> 02:09:37.608]  Now is the time for action.
[02:09:37.608 --> 02:09:39.428]  Now is the time for you to shine.
[02:09:39.428 --> 02:09:41.429]  And be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[02:09:45.134 --> 02:09:50.357]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[02:09:50.357 --> 02:09:54.640]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[02:09:54.640 --> 02:09:59.082]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[02:09:59.082 --> 02:10:07.488]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breathe air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[02:10:07.488 --> 02:10:14.712]  Powerful, quiet, and effective, the Breathe uses a four-step purification process to help you breathe easier and cleaner.
[02:10:15.132 --> 02:10:18.734]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars.
[02:10:18.734 --> 02:10:24.056]  But the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.
[02:10:24.056 --> 02:10:32.120]  The breeze and the ion cluster patented technology used in the system eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.
[02:10:32.120 --> 02:10:37.503]  Get the Alexa Pure Breeze today and save big on a world-class air filtration system for your home.
[02:10:37.503 --> 02:10:39.764]  Don't keep breathing toxic or dangerous air.
[02:10:39.764 --> 02:10:41.805]  Get this special today at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:10:46.937 --> 02:10:55.743]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:10:55.743 --> 02:11:15.717]  Lewczynski, whose sister heads up 23andMe, the DNA testing company that's been caught taking and using your DNA, also is on the board of Blacksoe Smith-Klein.
[02:11:16.926 --> 02:11:21.411]  And so what started happening about 10 years ago is big tech began to merge with big pharma.
[02:11:21.411 --> 02:11:24.996]  And now they don't let you do consumer reviews, they don't let people challenge it.
[02:11:24.996 --> 02:11:28.380]  Mothers that talk about their kids getting damaged by vaccines, they're just deleted off Facebook.
[02:11:29.662 --> 02:11:30.323]  Off Twitter.
[02:11:30.323 --> 02:11:31.664]  Off YouTube.
[02:11:31.664 --> 02:11:33.966]  It is a total takeover.
[02:11:33.966 --> 02:11:34.946]  And there's the article.
[02:11:34.946 --> 02:11:36.167]  You can see the full video there.
[02:11:36.167 --> 02:11:37.308]  YouTube CEO.
[02:11:37.308 --> 02:11:42.052]  Anything that goes against the WHO is a violation of YouTube's policies.
[02:11:42.052 --> 02:11:42.893]  That is the quote.
[02:11:42.893 --> 02:11:48.177]  So literally, David Icke of DavidIcke.com and IkeConnick.com.
[02:11:48.177 --> 02:11:51.260]  Now we're being told we wake up one day and the WHO
[02:11:52.631 --> 02:11:56.413]  San Antonio just passed a law that if you say Chinese virus, you're arrested.
[02:11:56.413 --> 02:12:00.634]  And they said, because the WHO says it's not Chinese.
[02:12:00.634 --> 02:12:05.336]  So now we've learned the WHO, run by Bill and Melinda Gates, is king of Earth.
[02:12:05.336 --> 02:12:07.337]  David Icke.
[02:12:07.337 --> 02:12:10.398]  Well, that's what it was created to do.
[02:12:10.398 --> 02:12:16.401]  Of course, the idea is to have everything globally, centrally controlled.
[02:12:16.401 --> 02:12:19.422]  And so what they want under their world government
[02:12:20.281 --> 02:12:24.395]  ...is all the major subject areas of human life.
[02:12:25.329 --> 02:12:26.750]  Controlled under one roof.
[02:12:26.750 --> 02:12:29.231]  That's why we have the World Trade Organization.
[02:12:29.231 --> 02:12:32.012]  That's why we have the World Health Organization.
[02:12:32.012 --> 02:12:48.559]  What's happening now is what it was originally created to do, and they've gone stepping stones, what I call the totalitarian tiptoe, to where it's become the arbiter of health policy and health truth the world over.
[02:12:48.559 --> 02:12:52.401]  And if you can, first of all, dominate
[02:12:53.201 --> 02:13:05.327]  The narrative and then censor all challenges to that narrative then basically all most people here are what you want them to hear and want them to believe.
[02:13:05.327 --> 02:13:16.333]  And you know, we have to not let these people like Susan Wojcicki and Zuckerberg get away with what they're doing.
[02:13:16.333 --> 02:13:21.996]  Because what they are, it's not beat about the bush, they are facilitators of fascism.
[02:13:22.865 --> 02:13:35.482]  If you look at any situation in history equivalent to medical doctors being deleted
[02:13:36.808 --> 02:13:53.701]  Because not what they're saying is wrong, but because it's not in sync with the official narrative through the World Health Organization, the only time you see that happen is in fascist and communist regimes.
[02:13:53.701 --> 02:13:55.363]  They're basically the same anyway.
[02:13:55.363 --> 02:13:57.204]  That's the only time you see it.
[02:13:57.204 --> 02:14:02.408]  So what Susan Wojcicki and Zuckerberg are doing
[02:14:03.061 --> 02:14:09.102]  Is there facilitating and advancing and making possible fascism?
[02:14:09.102 --> 02:14:11.923]  And what does that make them?
[02:14:11.923 --> 02:14:16.924]  Gates is absolutely fascistic in what he's doing.
[02:14:16.924 --> 02:14:18.625]  Who is this guy?
[02:14:18.625 --> 02:14:26.847]  He's a bloke that's come through selling software and now suddenly he's dictating global health policy.
[02:14:26.847 --> 02:14:28.067]  It's ridiculous.
[02:14:28.067 --> 02:14:29.407]  It's crazy.
[02:14:29.407 --> 02:14:31.228]  It's Alice in Wonderland.
[02:14:31.228 --> 02:14:31.988]  These people are
[02:14:33.266 --> 02:14:44.849]  Creating a fascist global state and they need to be called out on that, not, you know, beating about the bush and, you know, watching your language.
[02:14:44.849 --> 02:15:00.352]  They are fascists in what they're doing and they need to be called out on it and eventually brought to book about it because they have, in the last two months or so, together a handful of people
[02:15:01.081 --> 02:15:08.529]  Destroyed the livelihoods and the lives of vast numbers of people worldwide.
[02:15:08.529 --> 02:15:14.436]  And they all have to go to jail for crimes against humanity.
[02:15:14.436 --> 02:15:17.118]  When we get back power from this
[02:15:18.246 --> 02:15:28.130]  Fascistic network and we will eventually if people stiffen their backbone and start sitting there hoping that something will come up.
[02:15:28.130 --> 02:15:34.593]  It's not going to come up unless you make it come up because this is not where it's meant to end.
[02:15:34.593 --> 02:15:42.917]  This is just the stepping stone towards something far more extreme if we sit here and do nothing now.
[02:15:45.365 --> 02:15:46.506]  Extremely powerful.
[02:15:46.506 --> 02:15:56.170]  And looking into Wojcicki's sister, with 23andMe that's on record being caught taking people's DNA tests for secret operations, selling them, doing weird things.
[02:15:56.170 --> 02:15:59.651]  She got $300 million from Blacksoe SmithKline.
[02:15:59.651 --> 02:16:05.034]  And when you look into Google, Facebook, all of them, they are literally merging with Big Pharma.
[02:16:05.754 --> 02:16:17.931]  And now all these studies, all this research showing vaccine damage, even videos of the World Health Organization chief scientists last year saying vaccines are hurting people and that the cover-up needs to end, they will delete that off YouTube.
[02:16:17.931 --> 02:16:18.472]  So they've gone...
[02:16:19.614 --> 02:16:20.415]  Full fascist.
[02:16:20.415 --> 02:16:26.699]  We hear about Chinese doctors getting in trouble for talking about COVID-19 and getting arrested.
[02:16:26.699 --> 02:16:27.640]  That's big news here.
[02:16:27.640 --> 02:16:29.881]  But they're already doing that here.
[02:16:29.881 --> 02:16:31.402]  They're already shutting everybody down.
[02:16:31.402 --> 02:16:35.045]  There's this emergence, this leap into evil.
[02:16:35.045 --> 02:16:37.747]  You talked about it 30 years ago when you first went public.
[02:16:37.747 --> 02:16:42.010]  You said, this will build underneath the water for a while.
[02:16:42.010 --> 02:16:45.632]  But when it finally explodes out, there's a point where it must emerge.
[02:16:45.632 --> 02:16:48.014]  And is this not the great emergence of the New World Order?
[02:16:49.184 --> 02:16:50.044]  Well, it is.
[02:16:50.044 --> 02:16:53.786]  It's walked into the room, but the doors clicked behind it.
[02:16:53.786 --> 02:16:54.946]  It's come out of the shadows.
[02:16:54.946 --> 02:17:09.292]  At least we can see it now, and vast numbers of people who couldn't see it before have no choice but to acknowledge the world is not like they thought it was, and the forces in control are not what they thought those forces were.
[02:17:09.292 --> 02:17:15.454]  But the thing about GlaxoSmithKline is that has enormous, fundamental,
[02:17:15.834 --> 02:17:28.057]  Connections to Bill Gates and Bill Gates, of course, has fundamental connections to all these dark suits who are pushing the the quote virus policy in all the different countries.
[02:17:28.057 --> 02:17:31.838]  We have a the science advisor to Johnson.
[02:17:31.838 --> 02:17:33.719]  In other words, he's bloody handler.
[02:17:33.719 --> 02:17:37.820]  Guy called Valens, who was a long, long time executive
[02:17:38.500 --> 02:17:39.521]  We're good to go.
[02:18:01.130 --> 02:18:02.871]  They're just looking on.
[02:18:02.871 --> 02:18:18.182]  Or they might make the statements, but it's the technocrats answering to the same... And I totally agree with you, and I know you've got problems with Trump, so do I, but he's come out and said he thinks the numbers are overblown, he thinks it's meant to kill the economy, he's trying to get the public not to go along.
[02:18:18.182 --> 02:18:21.024]  What do you make of Trump not going along with it?
[02:18:21.024 --> 02:18:22.425]  Partially.
[02:18:22.425 --> 02:18:27.029]  I think that any politician, wherever they may be,
[02:18:27.739 --> 02:18:33.121]  Who looks upon the situation that we face.
[02:18:33.121 --> 02:18:38.104]  We'll see that we're facing an absolute catastrophe.
[02:18:38.104 --> 02:18:44.446]  You know, Johnson came to power just before Christmas with a massive majority.
[02:18:44.446 --> 02:18:48.088]  Big honeymoon period in front of him.
[02:18:48.088 --> 02:18:52.670]  And now the economy, as in America, has been devastated
[02:18:53.230 --> 02:18:58.035]  And the politicians are going to be stuck with trying to pick up the pieces as best they can.
[02:18:58.035 --> 02:19:04.460]  And when the economy goes down, it's going to be Trump and Johnson and Malasaro that get blamed by the very same medical tyranny that engineered it.
[02:19:04.460 --> 02:19:09.125]  That's why the politicians need to stop being politicians and be statesmen and expose these bastards.
[02:19:09.955 --> 02:19:14.857]  Exactly, that's the idea, that the politicians get the blame.
[02:19:14.857 --> 02:19:27.103]  But, you know, when it comes down to it, people like Johnson, and his like around the world, well, you know, don't start complaining when you get blamed for it, because in the end, you have to sign the papers.
[02:19:27.103 --> 02:19:30.404]  Officially, legally, you are the Prime Minister.
[02:19:30.404 --> 02:19:33.165]  So therefore, you could have stood up to this.
[02:19:33.165 --> 02:19:36.967]  You could have said to Ferguson, hold on a minute, half a million people
[02:19:37.567 --> 02:19:43.456]  David, I'd stay there because I want to ask what's coming next and how we can stop this if there's still time.
[02:19:43.456 --> 02:19:51.627]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[02:19:52.918 --> 02:19:57.662]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[02:19:57.662 --> 02:20:00.004]  Super Male Vitality!
[02:20:00.004 --> 02:20:08.852]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[02:20:08.852 --> 02:20:19.721]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[02:20:20.001 --> 02:20:20.702]  Yes.
[02:20:20.702 --> 02:20:25.608]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[02:20:25.608 --> 02:20:32.456]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[02:20:32.456 --> 02:20:33.597]  So what are you waiting for?
[02:20:33.597 --> 02:20:35.439]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[02:20:35.439 --> 02:20:38.262]  Never been a better time than right now.
[02:20:38.262 --> 02:20:38.683]  Super!
[02:20:42.789 --> 02:20:53.584]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an elk at say 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run.
[02:20:54.945 --> 02:21:02.066]  50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards, they've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins.
[02:21:02.066 --> 02:21:08.048]  But all of a sudden, they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over, and they die.
[02:21:08.048 --> 02:21:11.128]  Then you go back them and haul them back in.
[02:21:11.128 --> 02:21:14.649]  Well, that's what's going to happen to the entire world now.
[02:21:14.649 --> 02:21:19.570]  And that's what the economic numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the heart,
[02:21:20.510 --> 02:21:25.594]  And for the first world, it's going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[02:21:25.594 --> 02:21:30.438]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead, according to the UN, and I believe their numbers.
[02:21:30.438 --> 02:21:35.182]  Because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world.
[02:21:35.182 --> 02:21:41.467]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're a bunch of suckers and you've bought into something bigger than what Hitler did.
[02:21:42.368 --> 02:21:47.791]  Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars can now offer high-quality, storable food again.
[02:21:47.791 --> 02:21:53.334]  Other manufacturers were sold out eight weeks ago, and they told people they had food.
[02:21:53.334 --> 02:21:55.135]  Most folks never would deliver their food.
[02:21:55.135 --> 02:22:04.421]  Well, when our sponsors' food began to run short, they just suspended sales, so they opened more factories and secured more food.
[02:22:04.801 --> 02:22:10.063]  So if you get your orders in right now, they can take new orders and get it to you quickly.
[02:22:10.063 --> 02:22:23.189]  They'll probably have to suspend orders very, very soon again because the lockdown of the economy is killing food distribution, farming, you name it, and now it's mainstream news that food shortages and delivery are already starting to happen.
[02:22:23.949 --> 02:22:30.652]  If Trump can turn the economy back on and wrest control of our system away from the globalists, things may be okay.
[02:22:30.652 --> 02:22:32.893]  But it looks like it's going to get very, very rough.
[02:22:32.893 --> 02:22:39.516]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to secure the number one thing you need, high quality, storable food, ready to get to you and your family.
[02:22:39.516 --> 02:22:45.039]  Now, if you get your orders in at 4store.com.
[02:22:45.039 --> 02:22:47.660]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:03.058 --> 02:23:13.087]  Alex Jones, the cure to fake news, coming to you live from Austin, Texas.
[02:23:13.087 --> 02:23:16.130]  Well, I knew that the massive draconian censorship was coming.
[02:23:17.657 --> 02:23:22.743]  And I knew they were going to launch the medical tyranny because I could read what the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation were saying.
[02:23:22.743 --> 02:23:25.046]  I made a film about Bill Gates.
[02:23:25.046 --> 02:23:25.807]  He's a big part of it.
[02:23:25.807 --> 02:23:26.949]  Endgame.
[02:23:26.949 --> 02:23:27.029]  In 2007.
[02:23:29.284 --> 02:23:31.846]  And it predicts a worldwide medical tyranny.
[02:23:31.846 --> 02:23:32.846]  And I know about Bill Gates.
[02:23:32.846 --> 02:23:35.127]  His dad ran Planned Parenthood.
[02:23:35.127 --> 02:23:37.329]  His mom's on the IBM board.
[02:23:37.329 --> 02:23:41.191]  IBM was set up to carry out depopulation.
[02:23:41.191 --> 02:23:42.152]  This is all on record.
[02:23:42.152 --> 02:23:44.293]  There's Pulitzer Prize winning books on it.
[02:23:44.293 --> 02:23:47.355]  And so Gates is a front man for this larger network.
[02:23:48.420 --> 02:23:56.122]  And David Icke really scared them and hit the zeitgeist and was reaching, I don't know, extra 10 million people a week conservatively.
[02:23:56.122 --> 02:23:57.563]  They've tried to ban him now.
[02:23:57.563 --> 02:23:58.323]  It's backfiring.
[02:23:58.323 --> 02:23:59.723]  People are going to DavidIcke.com.
[02:23:59.723 --> 02:24:02.384]  They're going to I-C-K-O-N-I-C.com.
[02:24:02.384 --> 02:24:03.244]  Iconic.com.
[02:24:05.845 --> 02:24:07.246]  And that's what I love seeing.
[02:24:07.246 --> 02:24:08.946]  He's working with London Real.
[02:24:08.946 --> 02:24:09.947]  He's doing more shows.
[02:24:09.947 --> 02:24:16.369]  I noticed as they tried to oppress David and suppress David, I've never seen David look so happy and so sparkly-eyed.
[02:24:16.369 --> 02:24:20.971]  I'm the same way, because we've been proven right, and we see the fear of the globalists.
[02:24:20.971 --> 02:24:24.993]  If they were so powerful, they would just ignore us like they used to, but now...
[02:24:25.633 --> 02:24:31.477]  They can't ignore us because, as David said a few weeks ago, I am more powerful than these New World Order people.
[02:24:31.477 --> 02:24:33.639]  And you, the listeners, are more powerful.
[02:24:33.639 --> 02:24:34.840]  And they know that.
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:36.701]  That's why they want to make you dependent.
[02:24:36.701 --> 02:24:38.382]  That's why they want to poison you.
[02:24:38.382 --> 02:24:40.724]  That's why they want to shutter the doors of perception.
[02:24:40.724 --> 02:24:45.887]  So, David, I want to get into solutions and what's technically happening in the world in the limited time we have with you today.
[02:24:45.887 --> 02:24:46.608]  We're very appreciative.
[02:24:47.388 --> 02:25:00.392]  But speak to, you are more powerful, we are more powerful than they are, and that unconditional love, instead of being scared, opening up to the universe, and why they're so afraid of that.
[02:25:00.392 --> 02:25:07.795]  Well, you know, when you look at any situation, it can look a certain way if you look at it from a particular angle.
[02:25:07.795 --> 02:25:14.377]  And you look at what's happening with the censorship, and you can say, oh, look how powerful they are, they can censor people.
[02:25:15.396 --> 02:25:20.119]  But you look at it from another angle, and it's saying something very different.
[02:25:20.119 --> 02:25:21.520]  You know, just take me.
[02:25:21.520 --> 02:25:22.060]  I'm a guy.
[02:25:22.060 --> 02:25:27.023]  I'm living in a little flat on the Isle of Wight, just off the south coast of England.
[02:25:27.023 --> 02:25:41.091]  By the way, where they've chosen the Isle of Wight, where I live, to run the tracking trial for the, quote, virus, which, of course, I'm having nothing to do with it.
[02:25:41.091 --> 02:25:44.493]  But I'm on this little island in this little flat.
[02:25:46.055 --> 02:26:13.713]  I put out information and I put out videos and write books but they, powerful, so powerful, control Silicon Valley, they control governments, they control the banking system, they control the big pharma cartel, they control the whole institutions of controlling society and yet
[02:26:14.426 --> 02:26:26.258]  With all that control, they have to run around like someone shouted fire to stop someone being heard in a little flat on the Isle of Wight.
[02:26:26.258 --> 02:26:30.622]  Now that tells you where the real power is, and the real power is with the truth.
[02:26:31.252 --> 02:26:36.214]  Which has a much more powerful frequency than lies and mendacity.
[02:26:36.214 --> 02:26:46.359]  And what we're looking at here, while it may seem all we're imposing our power, actually what we're looking at is desperation for this reason.
[02:26:46.359 --> 02:26:48.920]  They have played their hand now.
[02:26:48.920 --> 02:26:53.482]  They've walked in the room, the doors click behind them, they've played their hand.
[02:26:53.482 --> 02:26:54.703]  And now they're running for home.
[02:26:56.088 --> 02:27:06.777]  And they're hoping they get to the line, complete control through AI, before enough people have woken up to stop them.
[02:27:06.777 --> 02:27:21.850]  But what they are building this on, their run for home, is a narrative about this virus that is absolutely insane.
[02:27:21.850 --> 02:27:22.971]  It's built on sand.
[02:27:24.011 --> 02:27:29.073]  Oh, it's built on absolute air.
[02:27:29.073 --> 02:27:35.075]  All you have to do is just pull a few little threads and the whole thing collapses.
[02:27:35.075 --> 02:27:37.916]  Because the story is insane.
[02:27:37.916 --> 02:27:42.158]  They're selling a deadly virus that doesn't freaking exist.
[02:27:42.158 --> 02:27:45.039]  And they're only managing to make it appear exist
[02:27:45.619 --> 02:27:54.745]  Uh, to exist with a test that doesn't test... And by the way, just briefly, David, when you were saying that already three months ago, I thought, okay, there's real weaponized viruses.
[02:27:54.745 --> 02:27:55.506]  They want to own it.
[02:27:55.506 --> 02:27:56.626]  They want to control it.
[02:27:56.626 --> 02:27:57.527]  But now it's coming out.
[02:27:57.527 --> 02:28:04.932]  They admit they authorize totally fake tests that say everybody is, uh, infected.
[02:28:04.932 --> 02:28:09.815]  And I'm sure you know Tanzania sent it off and said papayas and goats came up positive.
[02:28:09.815 --> 02:28:11.716]  It's totally fake!
[02:28:11.716 --> 02:28:14.058]  Yeah, they, they, they sent off
[02:28:14.697 --> 02:28:20.963]  A sample from Pawpaw and it came back positive for Covid-19.
[02:28:20.963 --> 02:28:22.284]  It's insane.
[02:28:22.284 --> 02:28:30.892]  So all this testing is merely to try to make it look as if it's everywhere when actually it's nowhere.
[02:28:30.892 --> 02:28:36.637]  So when you look at that, Alex, the whole foundation is air and wind.
[02:28:39.179 --> 02:28:45.222]  How can they defend that without censoring people exposing that?
[02:28:45.222 --> 02:28:46.462]  They have to.
[02:28:46.462 --> 02:28:49.844]  It's not that oil will impose our power.
[02:28:49.844 --> 02:28:57.347]  What if another one, all these meatpacking plants, no one's gotten sick, they test thousands, hundreds have it, everyone's asymptomatic, nobody's sick!
[02:28:58.271 --> 02:29:00.333]  Well, a couple of things, Alex, right?
[02:29:00.333 --> 02:29:03.995]  First of all, they have no symptoms because there is no virus.
[02:29:03.995 --> 02:29:10.420]  And here's another thing, which might lead us into another area, because they're using this to kill vast numbers of old people in this country.
[02:29:10.420 --> 02:29:12.702]  It's absolutely unbelievable.
[02:29:12.702 --> 02:29:20.889]  But why do old people die from this virus and young people don't?
[02:29:20.889 --> 02:29:21.709]  Oh, well, it's this.
[02:29:21.709 --> 02:29:22.750]  No, no.
[02:29:22.750 --> 02:29:23.691]  I'll tell you why it is.
[02:29:24.426 --> 02:29:33.907]  Because young people overwhelmingly do not have other conditions that threaten their life.
[02:29:33.907 --> 02:29:34.608]  Which really kills them.
[02:29:36.147 --> 02:29:37.588]  They don't have them.
[02:29:37.588 --> 02:29:49.299]  So because young people don't have other morbidities, those other reasons why they die don't exist overwhelmingly to be labelled COVID-19 deaths.
[02:29:49.299 --> 02:29:58.367]  But older people, and the older you get, the more of these other conditions and morbidities you have that are going to end your life.
[02:29:58.367 --> 02:30:01.750]  So they have endless potential with old people to
[02:30:03.211 --> 02:30:15.920]  Say it's a COVID-19 death... And by the way, now the president agrees with you and that's been proven right, but those of us that know this must get this out to everyone else that doesn't know, or this fraud is going to succeed.
[02:30:15.920 --> 02:30:26.127]  But the other thing is, I hear them saying, well, it seems as if people aren't getting immunity, even people that have had it, they're not getting immunity.
[02:30:26.127 --> 02:30:27.768]  Well, why aren't they getting immunity?
[02:30:27.768 --> 02:30:29.730]  Because they never had anything to get immunity of.
[02:30:32.071 --> 02:30:37.025]  That's why it doesn't act like any virus that ever acted before, because you're right, it's just completely made up!
[02:30:38.041 --> 02:30:41.904]  They're testing people for a genetic material, not a virus.
[02:30:41.904 --> 02:30:43.204]  Provable fact.
[02:30:43.204 --> 02:30:45.686]  And then they're testing positive.
[02:30:45.686 --> 02:30:48.208]  Oh, isolate for 14 days.
[02:30:48.208 --> 02:30:53.351]  Then they test them again for the genetic material that's in their body, not the virus.
[02:30:53.351 --> 02:30:55.192]  Oh, they've tested positive again.
[02:30:55.192 --> 02:30:56.373]  There's no immunity.
[02:30:56.373 --> 02:30:59.115]  But of course they've tested positive twice.
[02:30:59.115 --> 02:31:03.778]  They've tested positive for the same genetic material they had then and they still got.
[02:31:03.778 --> 02:31:04.719]  It's crazy.
[02:31:04.719 --> 02:31:06.360]  And so would a papaya.
[02:31:06.360 --> 02:31:07.741]  And so would a turtle out of the yard.
[02:31:09.101 --> 02:31:10.402]  That's crazy!
[02:31:10.402 --> 02:31:24.967]  But this is why they have to censor on the extraordinary scale that they are, because their narrative is so shot full of holes.
[02:31:24.967 --> 02:31:26.767]  Why would they go with such a shoddy narrative?
[02:31:26.767 --> 02:31:29.068]  Because you've been proven right, it is a giant hoax.
[02:31:29.068 --> 02:31:30.829]  Why would they go with something so ridiculous?
[02:31:30.829 --> 02:31:32.589]  I guess because you can't ever prove it?
[02:31:32.589 --> 02:31:34.390]  So it just becomes a war of propaganda?
[02:31:35.475 --> 02:31:40.420]  Well, I mentioned this the last time we spoke.
[02:31:40.420 --> 02:31:49.250]  If you release, and I'm not saying these bioweapons don't exist, my God they exist, but if you release one of them you lose control of it.
[02:31:49.250 --> 02:31:53.114]  If you have a fake virus which you're actually manipulating,
[02:31:54.160 --> 02:31:54.680]  I don't
[02:32:14.640 --> 02:32:17.342]  A virus that doesn't exist, you'll make it appear to exist.
[02:32:17.342 --> 02:32:18.443]  So you have control.
[02:32:18.443 --> 02:32:23.927]  You can make the numbers go up, you can make it flatline, or second wave, you can make it go again.
[02:32:23.927 --> 02:32:25.829]  So you have control of it.
[02:32:25.829 --> 02:32:32.754]  But in doing that, it means you're very, very vulnerable to the fact that you're lying.
[02:32:32.754 --> 02:32:36.637]  And, you know, when you've got... Alright, final segment, David Icke.
[02:32:36.637 --> 02:32:37.658]  You're on fire as usual.
[02:32:37.658 --> 02:32:40.280]  We'll come back and talk about solutions when we come back with David Icke.
[02:32:41.926 --> 02:32:49.851]  Globalism is all about making the nation-state and the population itself obsolete, non-essential.
[02:32:49.851 --> 02:33:02.338]  That's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes, and controls to where family farms and industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate.
[02:33:02.338 --> 02:33:08.362]  That's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out,
[02:33:08.922 --> 02:33:13.226]  They can simply look at us and say, because again, you are not essential.
[02:33:13.226 --> 02:33:16.249]  That's what the robots and all of this is about.
[02:33:16.249 --> 02:33:20.414]  It's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives.
[02:33:20.414 --> 02:33:24.238]  We can be told to stay in our houses, and after all, shut up!
[02:33:24.238 --> 02:33:25.879]  This world doesn't belong to people anyways.
[02:33:25.879 --> 02:33:30.404]  It belongs to the new AI gods, the rich elitists that have merged with machines.
[02:33:30.404 --> 02:33:32.206]  Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[02:33:33.004 --> 02:33:36.127]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing.
[02:33:36.127 --> 02:33:41.351]  These people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[02:33:41.351 --> 02:33:44.153]  I'm cutting this ad on May 10th, 2020.
[02:33:44.153 --> 02:33:51.939]  And within a week or so, many of the best-selling items that we're selling at InfoWareStore.com will no longer be at 50% off.
[02:33:51.939 --> 02:33:58.585]  In fact, last year I said I can't do 50% off anymore because our markup just isn't enough for us to be able to get enough profit to operate this operation.
[02:33:59.065 --> 02:34:02.147]  But I want you to get the Ultimate Krill Oil.
[02:34:02.147 --> 02:34:04.169]  I want you to get Bazo Beats.
[02:34:04.169 --> 02:34:06.350]  I want you to get DNA Force Plus.
[02:34:06.350 --> 02:34:08.912]  I want you to experience X2.
[02:34:08.912 --> 02:34:11.614]  I want you to get Real Red Pill and Real Red Pill Plus.
[02:34:11.614 --> 02:34:13.956]  They're all in stock right now and they're 30 to 60% off.
[02:34:16.878 --> 02:34:29.127]  More than 20 items are 50% off right now, but we're going to have to end the sale on most items in about a week, because a lot of the products are getting close to selling out, like Real Red Pill, Real Red Pill Plus, and Vazo Beats.
[02:34:29.127 --> 02:34:34.370]  So take action, be healthier, boost your body's natural defenses, and fund the InfoWar.
[02:34:34.370 --> 02:34:36.392]  Get these great products at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:34:43.097 --> 02:34:48.880]  The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think, even if it ends up hurting me short term.
[02:34:48.880 --> 02:34:54.662]  I believe in God, and I believe in the long run, it'll end up being better for myself and everybody else in this world we live together in.
[02:34:54.662 --> 02:34:56.943]  I understand what comes around and goes around.
[02:34:56.943 --> 02:34:58.804]  You reap what you sow, and I live that.
[02:34:58.804 --> 02:35:01.565]  And I fundamentally, at a cellular level, understand it.
[02:35:01.565 --> 02:35:03.086]  Now, if I would have hyped
[02:35:05.734 --> 02:35:06.255]  I don't know.
[02:35:29.418 --> 02:35:36.712]  Because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis to make sure people were incentivized to up their body's defenses.
[02:35:36.712 --> 02:35:40.418]  But now I'm telling you, with the economic crisis going on, get your storable food now.
[02:35:42.588 --> 02:35:45.730]  The lockdown is permanent dictatorship.
[02:35:45.730 --> 02:36:00.460]  The lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic rights being suspended and a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in full control.
[02:36:00.460 --> 02:36:02.561]  Many will submit through fear.
[02:36:02.561 --> 02:36:04.282]  Others will be bought off.
[02:36:04.282 --> 02:36:09.726]  But in the end, the globalists admit they're building a post-human world.
[02:36:09.726 --> 02:36:12.488]  And now that we're inside the cage, it's going to move.
[02:36:12.568 --> 02:36:29.839]  Very quickly submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing this.
[02:36:29.839 --> 02:36:34.543]  This is your dignity, your soul, your future being poured inside out.
[02:36:34.543 --> 02:36:38.265]  This is a scientific dictatorship taking full control of humanity.
[02:36:45.928 --> 02:36:48.538]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[02:37:01.107 --> 02:37:03.049]  Final segment with David Icke.
[02:37:03.049 --> 02:37:04.109]  We need your introduction.
[02:37:04.109 --> 02:37:05.771]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:37:05.771 --> 02:37:08.833]  Please remember, we knew the censorship was coming.
[02:37:08.833 --> 02:37:10.875]  We built this infrastructure.
[02:37:10.875 --> 02:37:19.161]  We built the satellite uplinks, the giant streaming systems, all of it, knowing that censorship was coming, and we need to have our own system.
[02:37:19.161 --> 02:37:21.643]  Google's worth $700 billion.
[02:37:21.643 --> 02:37:23.084]  Apple's worth a trillion.
[02:37:23.084 --> 02:37:24.606]  And they've got all their big fancy systems.
[02:37:24.606 --> 02:37:29.830]  We've done this with millions of dollars, and it costs millions and millions and millions of bandwidth to do what we're doing.
[02:37:30.270 --> 02:37:36.755]  In fact, I had the crew come in last week and they said, even though we got better deals on bandwidth, they said, look at what this is costing.
[02:37:36.755 --> 02:37:41.098]  Just some David Icke interviews we mirrored have like 5 million views on Band.Video.
[02:37:42.116 --> 02:37:44.378]  The doctor's press conference that got censored.
[02:37:44.378 --> 02:37:46.439]  That's got almost 2 million views.
[02:37:46.439 --> 02:37:50.122]  All these other things that have been taken down now have a place to go.
[02:37:50.122 --> 02:37:53.224]  Now it's making me a major target, and I'm not going to get into that yet.
[02:37:53.224 --> 02:37:55.705]  I may have to, though, but they're coming after me, folks.
[02:37:55.705 --> 02:38:03.371]  You saw they put this woman in jail that worked for Fauci, this virologist that's been exposing him for putting cancer viruses in vaccines.
[02:38:03.371 --> 02:38:08.895]  This is a very dangerous place to be, but we're all in danger, and so getting on our knees is not the way to go.
[02:38:08.895 --> 02:38:10.015]  So, InfoWarstorm,
[02:38:11.956 --> 02:38:15.317]  We've got the biggest sales that we've run since last Christmas.
[02:38:15.317 --> 02:38:17.877]  We won't have a sale this big until Christmas again.
[02:38:17.877 --> 02:38:21.518]  All current high-quality products are 30 to 60% off.
[02:38:21.518 --> 02:38:26.759]  Stuff like 8-Pack Power Stack, 13 different vitamins and minerals every day, two different packs, AM, PM.
[02:38:26.759 --> 02:38:28.000]  That is so close to cost.
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:29.960]  It's incredible.
[02:38:29.960 --> 02:38:32.820]  We have the Triionine back in stock, 60% off.
[02:38:32.820 --> 02:38:34.461]  X2 back in stock, 50% off.
[02:38:34.461 --> 02:38:36.061]  Vazo beats 40% off.
[02:38:36.061 --> 02:38:37.461]  These are really all high-quality products.
[02:38:37.461 --> 02:38:39.842]  We have the new 5G Kills t-shirts.
[02:38:41.414 --> 02:38:44.296]  Where they're trying to censor you if you expose 5G everywhere?
[02:38:44.296 --> 02:38:46.517]  Well, simply wear the shirt.
[02:38:46.517 --> 02:38:48.398]  And it's got Infowars.com on the back.
[02:38:48.398 --> 02:38:53.220]  And don't forget, you can also go to DavidIke.com and find all of his censored books and information as well.
[02:38:53.220 --> 02:38:57.963]  OK, in the nine minutes we have left, David, you wanted to get into the evil of Bill Gates.
[02:38:57.963 --> 02:38:59.784]  We're going to play a few clips of him.
[02:38:59.784 --> 02:39:03.246]  And you wanted to get into their targeting old people, which Bill Gates admits they're doing.
[02:39:03.246 --> 02:39:06.107]  But here's Bill Gates last week on CNN.
[02:39:06.107 --> 02:39:07.548]  Radio listeners can't see it.
[02:39:07.548 --> 02:39:09.449]  Fareed Zarkaria, the Bilderberg Group member,
[02:39:10.333 --> 02:39:11.794]  He says, oh, things are coming back to normal.
[02:39:11.794 --> 02:39:13.695]  This is going to be horrible and long.
[02:39:13.695 --> 02:39:19.239]  And Bill Gates looks like he has this murderous, psychotic smile on his face.
[02:39:19.239 --> 02:39:21.100]  Here it is.
[02:39:21.100 --> 02:39:23.782]  The economy is not going to be anything like it was.
[02:39:23.782 --> 02:39:25.904]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[02:39:25.904 --> 02:39:30.587]  It's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful this is.
[02:39:30.587 --> 02:39:33.389]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[02:39:33.389 --> 02:39:39.093]  It's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful this is.
[02:39:39.853 --> 02:39:45.796]  That's a trade-off society is making because of very, very high medical costs.
[02:39:45.796 --> 02:39:59.704]  And a lack of willingness to say, you know, is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would it be better not to lay off those ten teachers and to make that trade-off in medical costs?
[02:39:59.704 --> 02:40:04.727]  But that's called the death panel, and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[02:40:04.727 --> 02:40:06.668]  Teaching people that if we kill old people,
[02:40:08.502 --> 02:40:10.304]  Well, I've been writing my books for, well, decades now.
[02:40:33.220 --> 02:40:45.362]  That this network is not human as we perceive human, and what I say they are, and I explain why in the books, is biological AI.
[02:40:45.362 --> 02:40:59.224]  See, where they're pushing the human race, you know, all this synthetic biology and all that, the human form, the human body, is being pushed in the same direction of where they already are.
[02:40:59.224 --> 02:41:02.225]  So, when you look at these psychopaths,
[02:41:02.870 --> 02:41:11.353]  You look at Zuckerberg and look at Tony Blair even, even though he's way down the pecking order he is.
[02:41:11.353 --> 02:41:23.316]  And you see their mouth smile in terms of Gates, bloody rarely, but their eyes don't smile with their mouth.
[02:41:23.316 --> 02:41:31.219]  And when your eyes and your mouth are not speaking the same language, then you're dealing with some level of fraud.
[02:41:31.872 --> 02:41:32.012]  Okay.
[02:41:44.693 --> 02:41:48.174]  They don't have any, what we would call, humanity.
[02:41:48.174 --> 02:41:49.995]  They have no empathy.
[02:41:49.995 --> 02:41:51.715]  They have no compassion.
[02:41:51.715 --> 02:41:53.176]  What am I describing?
[02:41:53.176 --> 02:41:55.957]  I'm describing basically a computer program.
[02:41:55.957 --> 02:42:03.559]  You know, when you put a computer program into a computer that has the effect of doing horrendous things,
[02:42:04.321 --> 02:42:11.123]  The computer doesn't have any emotional filter or consequence, it just does it.
[02:42:11.123 --> 02:42:13.184]  It's like press enter does it.
[02:42:13.184 --> 02:42:14.804]  And that's what these people are like.
[02:42:14.804 --> 02:42:18.785]  This is why they have no compassion, they have no empathy.
[02:42:18.785 --> 02:42:30.489]  So you've got Gates, this man with the dead eyes, there's no life, there's no soul there, is quite happy, in fact he'll be getting off on it,
[02:42:31.303 --> 02:42:39.972]  To see literally billions of people in terrible straits just so he can get a vaccine inside them for the next stage.
[02:42:39.972 --> 02:42:43.776]  And he admits, oh, 700,000 will get sick, which we know is a way under us.
[02:42:43.776 --> 02:42:46.059]  But I agree with you, but there's a subtlety here.
[02:42:46.059 --> 02:42:47.600]  They don't have emotion about hurting us.
[02:42:47.600 --> 02:42:49.302]  In fact, they actually do have emotion.
[02:42:49.302 --> 02:42:50.864]  They enjoy hurting people.
[02:42:51.857 --> 02:42:56.639]  Yeah, that's what they're programmed to do, that's what psychopaths do.
[02:42:56.639 --> 02:43:11.006]  You look at the hair test of psychopathic traits, named after the guy who came up with it, and you tick off all the psychopathic traits, no empathies right at the top, and you are looking at the character traits of these people.
[02:43:11.693 --> 02:43:24.076]  You know, I mean, someone like Wojcicki and Zuckerberg, what level of psychopathy and lack of empathy do you need to have to just delete
[02:43:24.855 --> 02:43:28.977]  Vast numbers of people's right to a free opinion.
[02:43:28.977 --> 02:43:39.382]  Just to wipe away medical doctors from your platform for this only reason that they are saying the wrong things by the agenda that you are.
[02:43:39.382 --> 02:43:40.502]  By the way, it's been proven true.
[02:43:40.502 --> 02:43:46.905]  The limited time we have left, get into killing old people, recapping that, because they admit that's really the agenda.
[02:43:47.645 --> 02:43:55.190]  This is really important, and that clip was very appropriate there of Bill Gates talking about this.
[02:43:55.190 --> 02:44:09.880]  I have quoted a man in my books over the years whose name was Dr Richard Day, and he was an executive of Planned Parenthood, the same as Gates' father was involved in, as you mentioned earlier.
[02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:20.199]  And Richard Day stood up in front of a meeting of pediatricians in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1969.
[02:44:20.199 --> 02:44:22.623]  And no one knows why he did this, but I'm glad he did.
[02:44:23.725 --> 02:44:33.027]  He asked him to turn off recording equipment and not take notes because he was going to tell him how the world was going to change, because basically what he represented as a gopher was going to change it.
[02:44:33.027 --> 02:44:40.029]  And what he said that night, and in a book I wrote called Phantom Self, I detail at length what he said.
[02:44:40.029 --> 02:44:44.170]  It's unbelievable when you look at current events.
[02:44:44.170 --> 02:44:49.331]  And he talked, he described the internet in 1969 that's supposed to have been invented in the
[02:44:49.958 --> 02:45:15.502]  What 1980s and he said a stream of things in detail that have actually happened and one of the things he talked about was what he called the demise pill where the plan was eventually that you'll only be allowed to live a certain amount of time and when you reach that point you take a demise pill and he even described it this is the level of psychopathy
[02:45:16.722 --> 02:45:26.409]  Oh, you know, what would happen is mum and dad, they would have a party with their kids and, oh, mum and dad have done very well.
[02:45:26.409 --> 02:45:27.250]  What a good life.
[02:45:27.250 --> 02:45:31.733]  And then at the end of the party, they'd take the demise pill when you reach a certain age.
[02:45:31.733 --> 02:45:35.616]  So they've had this targeting of old people for a long time.
[02:45:35.616 --> 02:45:39.619]  And this fake virus has given them the chance to do it.
[02:45:39.619 --> 02:45:45.664]  So we at DavidEye.com have been approached by nurses who work in care homes.
[02:45:46.264 --> 02:45:48.887]  Who are saying that basically it's murder.
[02:45:48.887 --> 02:45:50.489]  That's the word they use.
[02:45:50.489 --> 02:45:52.231]  And that's why they suddenly have higher numbers.
[02:45:52.231 --> 02:45:54.034]  They kick the families out and they kill them.
[02:45:54.918 --> 02:45:56.499]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:45:56.499 --> 02:46:11.592]  What they're doing, according to these nurses, is they're designating people with Covid-19, old people in nursing homes and care homes, with no test, even though the test is nonsense, they don't even go through that, you know, facade.
[02:46:11.592 --> 02:46:12.733]  Just say they've got it.
[02:46:12.733 --> 02:46:19.900]  And if one has it, or is said to have had it, then by definition they take it that they've all got it.
[02:46:19.900 --> 02:46:22.462]  And when that happens, doctors stop coming in.
[02:46:23.734 --> 02:46:31.537]  And, you know, this one nurse was saying, we're begging for antibiotics for our old people, but we can't get them.
[02:46:31.537 --> 02:46:32.537]  And then they die.
[02:46:32.537 --> 02:46:35.698]  And when they die, they designate them Covid-19.
[02:46:35.698 --> 02:46:41.480]  But one of the other things that's happening, and this is now even hit the mainstream media in this country.
[02:46:41.480 --> 02:46:42.200]  Hallelujah.
[02:46:42.905 --> 02:46:59.038]  is the pressure on old people from doctors, their family doctors, and from hospital doctors and medical staff, for old people to sign do not resuscitate forms.
[02:46:59.038 --> 02:47:02.561]  So when they need to be, you know,
[02:47:03.706 --> 02:47:04.146]  That's right.
[02:47:04.146 --> 02:47:05.147]  Be a hero.
[02:47:05.147 --> 02:47:07.707]  Die so there's room in the hospitals that are actually empty.
[02:47:07.707 --> 02:47:08.828]  I know you said you could only in an hour.
[02:47:08.828 --> 02:47:09.568]  You gotta go.
[02:47:09.568 --> 02:47:10.268]  Two-minute break.
[02:47:10.268 --> 02:47:10.949]  Finish.
[02:47:10.949 --> 02:47:12.049]  Finish this point on the other side.
[02:47:12.049 --> 02:47:13.650]  You'll be gone at five after.
[02:47:13.650 --> 02:47:14.370]  David Icke's our guest.
[02:47:14.370 --> 02:47:20.952]  We have a very special report that we've not aired yet that will air at six after that we put a lot of work into.
[02:47:20.952 --> 02:47:22.333]  It's very important.
[02:47:22.333 --> 02:47:23.253]  That's coming up.
[02:47:23.253 --> 02:47:25.194]  And then I'm going to San Antonio.
[02:47:25.194 --> 02:47:26.594]  I haven't told you about this yet.
[02:47:26.594 --> 02:47:28.175]  I'm gonna get to it, I promise.
[02:47:28.175 --> 02:47:28.675]  Stay with us.
[02:47:28.675 --> 02:47:30.536]  Back in two minutes with David Icke of DavidIcke.com.
[02:47:31.673 --> 02:47:46.502]  Hiding in plain view, Politico, the Associated Press, you name it, admit that a half a billion people, extra 500 million, are now at the subsistence starvation level on top of all the millions already starving because of the global lockdown.
[02:47:46.502 --> 02:47:46.822]  That is
[02:47:47.282 --> 02:48:03.370]  Hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19, and the very people that cooked it up and gave me the chi-coms at the World Health Organization, with Bill Gates involved, are now the ones running the operation to shut down society, create a depression, and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[02:48:03.510 --> 02:48:04.551]  This is insane.
[02:48:04.551 --> 02:48:07.252]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[02:48:07.252 --> 02:48:08.713]  You need to get prepared now.
[02:48:08.713 --> 02:48:10.114]  You need to get high-quality, storable food.
[02:48:10.114 --> 02:48:13.216]  Now back in stock at InfowarStore.com.
[02:48:13.216 --> 02:48:17.319]  And you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[02:48:17.319 --> 02:48:23.583]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing.
[02:48:23.583 --> 02:48:25.584]  This is beyond 1984.
[02:48:25.584 --> 02:48:27.185]  The tyranny of the dual order is here.
[02:48:27.185 --> 02:48:29.607]  Get prepared now and spread the word in the Infowar.
[02:48:29.607 --> 02:48:31.008]  You are the Paul Reveres!
[02:48:32.754 --> 02:48:37.316]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history.
[02:48:37.316 --> 02:48:40.497]  The globalists have taken the gloves off and they've taken the mask off.
[02:48:40.497 --> 02:48:43.499]  And they're like, yeah, you're taking implantable chips.
[02:48:43.499 --> 02:48:45.280]  Yeah, we're into pedophilia.
[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:47.060]  Yeah, we're into world government.
[02:48:47.060 --> 02:48:48.921]  Yeah, you're obsolete.
[02:48:48.921 --> 02:48:49.982]  You are non-essential.
[02:48:50.962 --> 02:48:52.764]  We are shutting your ass down.
[02:48:52.764 --> 02:48:57.628]  Yeah, we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore.
[02:48:57.628 --> 02:48:59.289]  You're going to be the service economy.
[02:48:59.289 --> 02:49:04.674]  And now the globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy and you're obsolete.
[02:49:04.674 --> 02:49:09.819]  So you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance income so they can dictate your life.
[02:49:10.399 --> 02:49:13.001]  The handcuffs are going on right now.
[02:49:13.001 --> 02:49:15.682]  We have to resist and say no to the New World Order.
[02:49:15.682 --> 02:49:18.364]  And that takes you understanding you were right.
[02:49:18.364 --> 02:49:19.865]  And understanding I was right.
[02:49:19.865 --> 02:49:24.608]  And getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can.
[02:49:24.608 --> 02:49:26.409]  Now is the time for action.
[02:49:26.409 --> 02:49:28.210]  Now is the time for you to shine.
[02:49:28.210 --> 02:49:35.514]  And be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[02:49:35.514 --> 02:49:38.156]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:49:46.241 --> 02:49:48.123]  Alright, folks, last five minutes with David Icke.
[02:49:48.123 --> 02:49:51.185]  We have a special report coming up, and then Gerald Cilente.
[02:49:51.185 --> 02:49:52.827]  Let's go right to him.
[02:49:52.827 --> 02:49:56.189]  David, finish up your point about targeting the old, dehumanizing them.
[02:49:56.189 --> 02:49:57.210]  It's in the news today.
[02:49:57.210 --> 02:50:05.858]  Oh, I'm not resuscitating to make more room for the COVID, even though we're not going to help people that have heart attacks in the U.S.
[02:50:05.858 --> 02:50:07.139]  and the U.K.
[02:50:07.139 --> 02:50:08.280]  It's global.
[02:50:08.280 --> 02:50:09.841]  Who standardizes all of this?
[02:50:09.841 --> 02:50:13.164]  And then you were getting into the groups and organizations that are banning you right now.
[02:50:14.130 --> 02:50:17.418]  Yeah, well, it's centrally dictated.
[02:50:17.418 --> 02:50:20.445]  I mean, you know, it's like a transnational corporation.
[02:50:20.445 --> 02:50:24.233]  You know, you have a headquarters in the shadows in this case.
[02:50:24.921 --> 02:50:35.970]  And then you have the different subsidiary networks in each country that impose the will of the central, if you like, headquarters of this cult in their particular area.
[02:50:35.970 --> 02:50:39.733]  That's why the same things are happening in all the different countries.
[02:50:39.733 --> 02:50:43.476]  And the old people are absolutely being targeted.
[02:50:43.476 --> 02:50:45.798]  And, you know, when you look
[02:50:46.716 --> 02:50:58.780]  At the goals of the climate hoax, the human-caused climate hoax, and you look at the goals and the happenings of this virus scam, they are the same.
[02:50:58.780 --> 02:51:04.862]  And one of the things, of course, that the climate cult has been doing is demonising old people.
[02:51:04.862 --> 02:51:07.763]  It's those old people, they've destroyed our world.
[02:51:07.763 --> 02:51:10.143]  This is what Greta Thunberg's always talking about.
[02:51:10.143 --> 02:51:14.025]  The old people, they're the ones that have destroyed our world.
[02:51:14.025 --> 02:51:14.805]  How dare you?
[02:51:16.126 --> 02:51:23.410]  And all the pressure, all the propaganda is to demonize old people.
[02:51:23.410 --> 02:51:25.711]  And you know, what do we need old people for?
[02:51:25.711 --> 02:51:27.112]  You know, they're no use anymore.
[02:51:27.112 --> 02:51:29.854]  This is the whole propaganda narrative.
[02:51:29.854 --> 02:51:33.076]  And now they've got their opportunity.
[02:51:33.076 --> 02:51:38.679]  And I'll say this to any younger people that think old people don't matter.
[02:51:39.989 --> 02:51:45.253]  They've had decades and decades and decades and decades and decades of experience.
[02:51:45.253 --> 02:51:56.840]  They've been there, done it, got the t-shirt and the jacket, and maybe there's something you might be able to learn from them instead of demonising them, because
[02:51:58.206 --> 02:52:12.869]  If you listen to the older people, you might not be scammed in the way you are being scammed currently, to push for the very happenings, the very policy changes, the very society that is going to take your people.
[02:52:12.869 --> 02:52:23.312]  Well, that's another reason they want to get rid of the old people, is they didn't grow up under this, and they want to be able just to erase the past, and now with all the AI censorship, they can actually go in and digitally erase the past.
[02:52:24.383 --> 02:52:34.336]  Yeah, they don't want young people and old people interacting because of the experience that older people have.
[02:52:34.336 --> 02:52:38.822]  Older people knew the world before it became what it is.
[02:52:38.822 --> 02:52:39.143]  Younger
[02:52:39.343 --> 02:52:39.843]  That's right.
[02:52:39.843 --> 02:52:42.163]  Old people need to get very vocal and very active.
[02:52:42.163 --> 02:52:42.624]  If all of us
[02:53:07.996 --> 02:53:09.346]  Yes, exactly.
[02:53:09.346 --> 02:53:10.353]  Just start speaking out.
[02:53:11.380 --> 02:53:15.621]  There's this phrase, there's no fool like an old fool, and that is true.
[02:53:15.621 --> 02:53:20.402]  You know, if you've lived 70, 80 years and learned nothing, that's true.
[02:53:20.402 --> 02:53:37.965]  But there's vast numbers of people of that age who have learned something and have experience that needs to be listened to and not just waved away with an arrogant wave of the hand, which is what's happening to so many old people now.
[02:53:37.965 --> 02:53:40.286]  My grandparents were all so incredibly smart.
[02:53:40.806 --> 02:53:43.208]  Life matters.
[02:53:43.208 --> 02:53:48.492]  All life matters, no matter what its color is and no matter what its age is.
[02:53:48.492 --> 02:53:58.560]  That's something that maybe we could learn and realize we're all part of one family, no matter what our age, no matter what our color, no matter what our background.
[02:53:58.560 --> 02:54:07.727]  And if we did that, then we could come together in unity instead of being divided and ruled so the few can control the many, because the many are at war with each other.
[02:54:08.610 --> 02:54:09.971]  Everyone, take action.
[02:54:09.971 --> 02:54:13.853]  Infowars.com, DavidIke.com, Iconic.com.
[02:54:13.853 --> 02:54:17.675]  You're the only way this gets out, and you're doing a great job getting it out, so we salute you and thank you.
[02:54:17.675 --> 02:54:18.575]  David, thanks for the time.
[02:54:18.575 --> 02:54:19.336]  We really appreciate it.
[02:54:19.336 --> 02:54:21.217]  Look forward to talking to you soon.
[02:54:21.217 --> 02:54:21.617]  See you, mate.
[02:54:21.617 --> 02:54:22.177]  Bye.
[02:54:22.177 --> 02:54:22.957]  There goes David Ike.
[02:54:22.957 --> 02:54:24.178]  Okay, great job with the crew.
[02:54:24.178 --> 02:54:26.059]  I have this special report coming up.
[02:54:26.059 --> 02:54:31.522]  And yes, we've got airplanes flying over San Antonio that say, SayChineseVirus.com.
[02:54:31.522 --> 02:54:32.522]  SayChineseVirus.com.
[02:54:32.522 --> 02:54:34.123]  It takes you to Infowars.com.
[02:54:34.123 --> 02:54:36.624]  I'm about to drive down to San Antonio to say it.
[02:54:36.624 --> 02:54:37.265]  They may arrest me.
[02:54:40.447 --> 02:54:42.831]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[02:54:42.831 --> 02:54:48.802]  They're amazing, they're cutting edge, you love them, I love them, and they fund the InfoWar in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[02:54:48.802 --> 02:54:52.749]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development
[02:54:53.891 --> 02:54:55.532]  That is amazing.
[02:54:55.532 --> 02:55:03.216]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[02:55:03.216 --> 02:55:05.537]  And there's another innovation.
[02:55:05.537 --> 02:55:07.618]  It's the spray cap.
[02:55:07.618 --> 02:55:13.021]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality.
[02:55:13.021 --> 02:55:15.202]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[02:55:15.202 --> 02:55:16.123]  I like to put it on my hands.
[02:55:16.863 --> 02:55:18.344]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[02:55:18.344 --> 02:55:21.186]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so don't spray it right in your eyes.
[02:55:21.186 --> 02:55:25.588]  But I just love it, personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[02:55:25.588 --> 02:55:27.369]  So, this is a real innovation.
[02:55:27.369 --> 02:55:33.713]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out.
[02:55:33.713 --> 02:55:35.254]  It smells great.
[02:55:35.254 --> 02:55:37.075]  It's so refreshing.
[02:55:37.075 --> 02:55:37.936]  This is a big winner.
[02:55:45.629 --> 02:55:49.494]  There's a new Twilight Zone episode that's premiering here in about 20 seconds.
[02:55:50.928 --> 02:55:52.969]  New Twilight Zone episode 666.
[02:55:52.969 --> 02:55:54.629]  It's on Bandot.
[02:55:54.629 --> 02:55:55.730]  Video just went live.
[02:55:55.730 --> 02:55:56.910]  Please share it.
[02:55:56.910 --> 02:55:58.751]  I'm about to get in the car and drive down to San Antonio.
[02:55:58.751 --> 02:56:00.412]  I'll be at the Alamo in about an hour and a half.
[02:56:00.412 --> 02:56:03.333]  They say they'll arrest you if you say the words, Chinese virus.
[02:56:03.333 --> 02:56:09.795]  We have airplanes above San Antonio right now with the words, SayChineseVirus.com.
[02:56:09.795 --> 02:56:11.756]  SayChineseVirus.com.
[02:56:11.756 --> 02:56:13.777]  Exercise the First Amendment or lose it.
[02:56:13.777 --> 02:56:15.697]  I'll see you in San Antonio in about an hour and a half.
[02:56:15.697 --> 02:56:17.038]  Here is the new special report.
[02:56:31.448 --> 02:56:42.073]  You live on a planet where the governments of the world are openly telling you that you are non-essential, obsolete.
[02:56:42.073 --> 02:56:58.081]  Imagine living on that planet in the year 2020 that major world leaders in places like Israel and Sweden are proposing everyone be implanted with a microchip and be tracked by the state.
[02:56:58.081 --> 02:57:00.502]  Imagine living in a world
[02:57:01.803 --> 02:57:10.672]  Where the third world population is already starving to death and where the general public has been locked in their homes for at least two months.
[02:57:10.672 --> 02:57:23.585]  And the people are being told that now robot drones and robot dogs are going to be enforcers and make sure they follow the new rules and that things are never going back to the way they were.
[02:57:24.838 --> 02:57:33.006]  Imagine that at first you were told it's only two weeks to cut the curve of two million projected dead in America.
[02:57:33.006 --> 02:57:38.691]  And then it turns out that was all completely exaggerated at least 30 times.
[02:57:38.691 --> 02:57:45.077]  And then imagine that it turns out it's not a Twilight Zone episode, but it's the real world in 2020.
[02:57:46.673 --> 02:57:55.271]  And that the man leading the initiative for the United Nations, Bill Gates, is openly obsessed with population reduction.
[02:57:57.000 --> 02:58:01.584]  And he's openly said that vaccines will contribute to depopulating the world.
[02:58:01.584 --> 02:58:05.126]  We see a lot of things that are going very well.
[02:58:05.126 --> 02:58:07.668]  Things like reducing childhood death.
[02:58:07.668 --> 02:58:10.230]  Things like reducing childhood death.
[02:58:10.230 --> 02:58:17.396]  And he even admits in 2020 that there are going to be 700,000 people that get sick or who die from the vaccine.
[02:58:17.396 --> 02:58:21.859]  We have, you know, one in 10,000 side effects.
[02:58:21.859 --> 02:58:23.881]  That's, you know, way more, 700,000.
[02:58:26.182 --> 02:58:28.444]  Uh, you know, people who will suffer from that.
[02:58:28.444 --> 02:58:32.427]  But nevertheless, life won't ever return to normal.
[02:58:32.427 --> 02:58:38.151]  But if you want to be able to go outside, you're going to be forced to take this shot.
[02:58:38.151 --> 02:58:41.433]  And then, of course, now they're announcing it's going to be hundreds of shots.
[02:58:41.433 --> 02:58:45.416]  And it's worse than just the chip now being openly pushed.
[02:58:46.809 --> 02:58:57.279]  No, now they're saying they have a special vaccine for you called a DNA vaccine that goes into the nucleus of your cell and reprograms it.
[02:58:57.279 --> 02:59:04.165]  And in the rat studies and other studies, it causes all sorts of mutations and cancer.
[02:59:04.165 --> 02:59:06.247]  But you don't have to imagine it.
[02:59:06.247 --> 02:59:07.529]  It's the real world in 2020.
[02:59:07.529 --> 02:59:10.331]  And it's what you and I and all of us face.
[02:59:11.576 --> 02:59:20.702]  A nightmare dystopia that's been prepared and tested on third world populations and on the victims of the communist Chinese regime.
[02:59:20.702 --> 02:59:26.106]  That's now leaving beta and going into full operations.
[02:59:26.106 --> 02:59:32.251]  You see, the chip is meant to track you and control you and keep you locked down.
[02:59:32.251 --> 02:59:34.512]  But that's just the beginning.
[02:59:34.512 --> 02:59:38.135]  The scientific dictatorship wants the precedent to be able to put in your body
[02:59:39.170 --> 02:59:46.694]  Whatever they want, whenever they want, and have you not be able to challenge it and speak out against it.
[02:59:46.694 --> 02:59:54.339]  And in Bill Gates' own words, they want liability protection for these new so-called vaccines being introduced in the body.
[02:59:55.677 --> 03:00:11.749]  For more than 20 years, they've developed and tested vaccines that actually go into parts of the brain and carry out a high-tech lobotomy to eat certain nerve-ending receptor sites associated with spiritual experiences and high brainwaves.
[03:00:11.749 --> 03:00:22.117]  Those are the same receptor sites that your body naturally produces endorphins when you do a good job or win that promotion at work or end up finding the woman or man of your dreams.
[03:00:23.817 --> 03:00:31.438]  These are literally behavioral vaccines that reprogram the way our brains work by destroying parts of our mind.
[03:00:31.438 --> 03:00:35.899]  And they're being pushed as anti-stress and anti-drug addiction vaccines.
[03:00:35.899 --> 03:00:42.460]  Yes, you won't want alcohol or heroin or nicotine ever again because those receptor sites would have been destroyed.
[03:00:42.460 --> 03:00:45.001]  But those receptor sites were there for a reason.
[03:00:45.001 --> 03:00:51.602]  They were picking up natural chemicals and endorphins that your body produces when it sees you doing the right thing.
[03:00:53.154 --> 03:01:18.300]  But you see, the globalists know that when we have a conscience, and we feel good, and the universe that God created, that programmed us, rewards us with those spiritual experiences that we don't want the New World Order, we don't want their false system, we don't want their materialistic control grid, and so that's why they want to literally burn that out of our brains, so we will become psychotic automatons like they are.
[03:01:18.920 --> 03:01:25.283]  Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister, is proposing microchips for all the children in Israel.
[03:01:25.283 --> 03:01:31.686]  Because after all, all your cars in Israel are already tracked by the Israeli intelligence agencies for your safety.
[03:01:31.686 --> 03:01:35.028]  So why shouldn't the people all be tracked as well?
[03:01:35.808 --> 03:01:39.392]  Netanyahu's doing that because this is part of a larger globalist agenda.
[03:01:39.392 --> 03:01:44.378]  And Netanyahu is on the verge of being removed from office because of corruption charges.
[03:01:44.378 --> 03:01:47.782]  He is a compromised, blackmailed, lame duck.
[03:01:47.782 --> 03:01:51.586]  But regardless of the reasons he's personally doing it, we all know
[03:01:52.307 --> 03:01:59.791]  At a common sense level, that this is beyond a science fiction nightmare novel and must absolutely be opposed.
[03:01:59.791 --> 03:02:02.792]  It's not that we have something to hide or that we've done something wrong.
[03:02:02.792 --> 03:02:14.918]  We know that powerful corporations and governments from the beginning of the internet age have been spying on the public, have been manipulating the public, and have been twisting information and choices so the public is not informed.
[03:02:15.658 --> 03:02:38.007]  We see massive censorship taking place, not just of InfoWars now, but of major journalists and doctors and famous virologists that are coming out and pointing out that COVID-19 is not even that deadly and that all the regular deaths from flus and the cold and heart attacks and cancers are being put in the COVID-19 column.
[03:02:38.007 --> 03:02:38.207]  Even
[03:02:39.508 --> 03:02:42.851]  Fauci's own team admits that that's the case.
[03:02:42.851 --> 03:02:45.513]  But if you point it out, you get banned.
[03:02:45.513 --> 03:02:52.940]  So we're not just seeing the rollout of implantable microchips and forced high-tech deadly inoculations that reprogram our bodies.
[03:02:52.940 --> 03:02:54.721]  That's what cancer does.
[03:02:54.721 --> 03:03:02.328]  We're now seeing a total control grid of AI going in and even censoring what people can send on their own private text messages.
[03:03:03.564 --> 03:03:06.605]  The globalists know that their whole program has been exposed.
[03:03:06.605 --> 03:03:08.026]  They know that they're in trouble.
[03:03:08.026 --> 03:03:26.532]  They know the UN's own World Health Organization group last December met for a two-day conference and admitted that vaccines are hurting people and they're not being properly tested and that there's a cover-up and that the doctors who are the front line have become quote wobbly and don't believe in them.
[03:03:26.532 --> 03:03:28.433]  So instead of backing off and admitting
[03:03:29.517 --> 03:03:29.677]  I think?
[03:03:46.704 --> 03:03:51.547]  You don't live until you accept in your body whatever we want to put in it.
[03:03:51.547 --> 03:03:57.350]  Oh, and by the way, there's liability protection for those companies so they can hurt you and get away with it.
[03:03:57.350 --> 03:04:03.713]  And then if you try to complain about it online, we will ban your internet identity and not even let you communicate with other humans.
[03:04:03.713 --> 03:04:04.414]  So just like that.
[03:04:05.034 --> 03:04:06.895]  We're inside the New World Order, just like that.
[03:04:06.895 --> 03:04:08.677]  We're inside Revelations, just like that.
[03:04:08.677 --> 03:04:10.138]  We're inside the dystopia.
[03:04:10.138 --> 03:04:13.840]  And they are testing and tracking and seeing how much we will put up with.
[03:04:13.840 --> 03:04:18.324]  That's why they sycophantically sit up there on the news and say, you're a hero when you wear the mask.
[03:04:18.324 --> 03:04:20.225]  You're a hero when you don't go out.
[03:04:20.225 --> 03:04:22.567]  You're a hero in this new paradigm.
[03:04:22.567 --> 03:04:23.448]  And you're the leaders.
[03:04:23.448 --> 03:04:24.949]  You've done such a good job.
[03:04:24.949 --> 03:04:29.332]  And Hollywood says it's permanent now to save the Earth, to lower our carbon footprint.
[03:04:29.332 --> 03:04:30.993]  And this is the new Green Deal.
[03:04:30.993 --> 03:04:32.914]  The post-human era is here.
[03:04:33.835 --> 03:04:41.160]  By a bunch of selfish rich billionaires with huge estates and private jets telling you you can't have a car, go on vacation.
[03:04:41.160 --> 03:04:44.982]  This is a giant authoritarian power grab by eugenicists.
[03:04:44.982 --> 03:04:47.303]  I've been aware of their operation for decades.
[03:04:47.303 --> 03:04:51.086]  I've made films, I've written books, I've exposed them in their own words.
[03:04:51.086 --> 03:04:53.968]  But now it's not all beta test, it's not all theoretical.
[03:04:54.888 --> 03:05:11.725]  Now they're going operational against you and your family, and you can decide to have Stockholm Syndrome, and love your abusers, and lie to yourself, or you can decide to have the power that God gave you to start speaking out, to start saying no, and to start researching all this information and educating others.
[03:05:11.725 --> 03:05:13.207]  The choice is now out in the open.
[03:05:15.194 --> 03:05:26.021]  Decide whether you want to have a pro-human future, or whether you're going to allow these anti-human monsters to take control of human destiny and the future of all our lives.
[03:05:26.021 --> 03:05:30.524]  The good news is, for those of you in denial, you're not going to have to wait for the dystopia anymore.
[03:05:30.524 --> 03:05:32.145]  It's going to come very, very quickly.
[03:05:32.145 --> 03:05:43.152]  And you're going to find that compliance with this... What are champions made of?
[03:05:43.152 --> 03:05:44.293]  Here's a man who can show you
[03:05:50.862 --> 03:05:52.522]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[03:05:52.522 --> 03:05:53.763]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[03:05:53.763 --> 03:05:54.683]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[03:05:54.683 --> 03:05:55.843]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store... Wait!
[03:05:55.843 --> 03:05:57.344]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store hotline.
[03:05:57.344 --> 03:05:58.184]  AAA-253-3139 is the InfoWars store...
[03:06:17.049 --> 03:06:20.530]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[03:06:20.530 --> 03:06:22.151]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[03:06:22.151 --> 03:06:24.131]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139 is the InfoWars Store hotline.
[03:06:24.131 --> 03:06:25.212]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, that's InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:06:37.876 --> 03:06:44.218]  I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen to a song and telling you all these horrible things.
[03:06:44.218 --> 03:06:48.339]  But you notice, almost everything we've talked about, horrible, has come true.
[03:06:48.339 --> 03:06:52.160]  We were warning everybody to try to stop it.
[03:06:52.160 --> 03:06:56.741]  It's like telling somebody, if you got a pool, put a fence around it if you have little kids.
[03:06:56.741 --> 03:06:59.562]  Because even if they're good swimmers, they can hit their head and drown.
[03:06:59.562 --> 03:07:01.863]  People don't listen, they go out and their kid's dead in the pool.
[03:07:02.563 --> 03:07:06.844]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the death of the third world and the collapse of the first world.
[03:07:06.844 --> 03:07:10.685]  And this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalists.
[03:07:10.685 --> 03:07:13.306]  And they admit they've orchestrated it.
[03:07:13.306 --> 03:07:15.766]  They admit it's, quote, good to save the Earth.
[03:07:15.766 --> 03:07:17.707]  And they're teaching us to be more frugal.
[03:07:17.707 --> 03:07:22.668]  And they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy.
[03:07:23.328 --> 03:07:30.812]  I know all this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public because it's their operations manual.
[03:07:30.812 --> 03:07:40.877]  I wish this wasn't the case, but there really are evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions and we've got to stop them.
[03:07:40.877 --> 03:07:43.499]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:07:59.654 --> 03:08:03.115]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:03.115 --> 03:08:07.775]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:08:07.775 --> 03:08:11.896]  Hello, hello.
[03:08:11.896 --> 03:08:13.957]  Great to be on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:13.957 --> 03:08:17.337]  And here we are.
[03:08:17.337 --> 03:08:22.178]  It's so sad what's going on.
[03:08:22.178 --> 03:08:27.579]  To think, in just a few months, they've sapped
[03:08:28.189 --> 03:08:30.410]  They sap joy out of life.
[03:08:30.410 --> 03:08:31.691]  I shouldn't be smiling.
[03:08:31.691 --> 03:08:33.912]  I might get arrested.
[03:08:33.912 --> 03:08:37.154]  They sap joy out of life.
[03:08:37.154 --> 03:08:42.857]  And they've come up with their new abnormal.
[03:08:42.857 --> 03:08:47.240]  We're supposed to behave like these freaks that are freaks.
[03:08:47.240 --> 03:08:49.921]  That's their normal, is to be a freak.
[03:08:49.921 --> 03:08:56.185]  The politicians, politics, many tics, sucking the life out of us right in front of our eyes.
[03:08:57.677 --> 03:09:01.179]  And most people believe it.
[03:09:01.179 --> 03:09:06.262]  It's so dark in what's going on.
[03:09:06.262 --> 03:09:08.504]  They just, again, they've sapped the joy out of life.
[03:09:08.504 --> 03:09:11.466]  You can't make this up.
[03:09:11.466 --> 03:09:15.088]  Because that's all they're doing is they're making it up.
[03:09:15.088 --> 03:09:16.549]  You know, we have the Trends Journal.
[03:09:16.549 --> 03:09:18.710]  It's a weekly magazine.
[03:09:18.710 --> 03:09:20.431]  And we're finishing this issue.
[03:09:20.431 --> 03:09:21.712]  It goes out tomorrow.
[03:09:21.712 --> 03:09:25.895]  And I'm writing about all the lockdowns that are going on.
[03:09:28.424 --> 03:09:32.126]  And now they're opening them up.
[03:09:32.126 --> 03:09:34.087]  And they're making it up.
[03:09:34.087 --> 03:09:38.109]  There's no scientific data for what they're doing.
[03:09:38.109 --> 03:09:41.310]  It's a science fiction movie.
[03:09:41.310 --> 03:09:44.252]  Right in front of our eyes.
[03:09:44.252 --> 03:09:50.254]  Oh, in this state we're going to say, um, 50% occupancy.
[03:09:50.254 --> 03:09:52.035]  Well, no, we're going to say 25% occupancy.
[03:09:54.966 --> 03:10:01.428]  We're going to call like that little gruesome Newsome over there and the other daddy's boy Cuomo over here.
[03:10:01.428 --> 03:10:08.891]  We're going to tell you what businesses are essential and who isn't.
[03:10:08.891 --> 03:10:14.353]  So now in California, they opened up some businesses, but only curbside service.
[03:10:14.353 --> 03:10:17.014]  And among them, florists.
[03:10:17.014 --> 03:10:20.495]  Oh, florists, they're essential businesses.
[03:10:20.495 --> 03:10:23.496]  What is Newsome's family in the flower business?
[03:10:25.802 --> 03:10:36.970]  And in a lot of states, New York included, can't go to bars, can't go to restaurants and have a good time, but you can buy all the booze you want from the stores.
[03:10:36.970 --> 03:10:39.411]  That's an essential business.
[03:10:39.411 --> 03:10:52.220]  These are the same low-life pieces of garbage crap from that political family that gave us Prohibition in the 1920s.
[03:10:52.220 --> 03:10:54.181]  Roaring 20s to beat Prohibition.
[03:10:54.181 --> 03:10:55.142]  Then the Depression happened.
[03:10:56.561 --> 03:10:58.542]  Yeah, let's get rid of prohibition, you know?
[03:10:58.542 --> 03:11:02.705]  We'll do... We're politicians, politics.
[03:11:02.705 --> 03:11:04.207]  We'll suck the life out of you.
[03:11:04.207 --> 03:11:06.488]  We'll suck taxes from you.
[03:11:06.488 --> 03:11:13.333]  We have a Great Depression, but now we're going to lift prohibition and we're going to make it okay to drink.
[03:11:13.333 --> 03:11:15.214]  Great.
[03:11:15.214 --> 03:11:18.817]  And we're going to tax the hell out of you.
[03:11:18.817 --> 03:11:25.702]  We're going to cost you $10, you cost your $2, but we got all these different taxes on there.
[03:11:26.531 --> 03:11:28.073]  So we're politics.
[03:11:28.073 --> 03:11:32.256]  We suck it out of you so we don't have to work.
[03:11:32.256 --> 03:11:38.702]  We don't have to worry about losing our jobs, paying for our health care, our rent, our mortgages, our retirement.
[03:11:38.702 --> 03:11:39.523]  We got the best.
[03:11:39.523 --> 03:11:40.924]  We're politics.
[03:11:40.924 --> 03:11:44.027]  So we steal your money in the name of taxes.
[03:11:44.027 --> 03:11:48.832]  And that's what they've done over here in New York and other states.
[03:11:48.832 --> 03:11:52.215]  So buying booze is an essential business.
[03:11:53.703 --> 03:12:00.568]  I'm mentioning this because they're opening up bit by bit and piece by piece.
[03:12:00.568 --> 03:12:10.756]  As I well said on David's night show on InfoWars over a year ago, March.
[03:12:10.756 --> 03:12:15.620]  A year ago this last March.
[03:12:15.620 --> 03:12:19.163]  We're going into the Greatest Depression.
[03:12:19.163 --> 03:12:21.224]  There's a slowdown going on globally.
[03:12:21.224 --> 03:12:22.966]  I only put out the numbers and the facts.
[03:12:24.189 --> 03:12:26.371]  There was a recession down there in Mexico.
[03:12:26.371 --> 03:12:30.454]  Oh, and how about that place over there called Germany?
[03:12:30.454 --> 03:12:36.498]  Oh yeah, one of the biggest industrial centers in the world, the highest quality product of industrialization.
[03:12:36.498 --> 03:12:41.682]  Oh, they were going into recession too, as was the Eurozone.
[03:12:41.682 --> 03:12:53.771]  Now, opening up businesses bit by bit and piece by piece, and having these political freaks make up these laws, like you got this jerk over here in Ocean City, New Jersey.
[03:12:55.126 --> 03:13:01.790]  Oh, you can go surfing and this and that, but you can't lie on the beach.
[03:13:01.790 --> 03:13:05.412]  Other places you can't walk on the boardwalk.
[03:13:05.412 --> 03:13:21.862]  Hey, stupid moron, imbecile, jerk, low-life piece of garbage, governor this, mayor that, controller you-know-who, or whatever,
[03:13:23.246 --> 03:13:27.907]  Did you ever hear of vitamin D?
[03:13:27.907 --> 03:13:32.989]  Dopey.
[03:13:32.989 --> 03:13:36.009]  Jerk.
[03:13:36.009 --> 03:13:39.070]  One study coming out after another.
[03:13:39.070 --> 03:13:41.251]  This is not a conspiracy theory.
[03:13:41.251 --> 03:13:52.534]  How vitamin D helps prevent diseases, including
[03:13:54.073 --> 03:13:55.314]  COVID-19.
[03:13:55.314 --> 03:13:59.917]  Hey, how about that place called Haiti?
[03:13:59.917 --> 03:14:03.720]  Oh yeah, one of the highest living standards in the world, huh?
[03:14:03.720 --> 03:14:06.802]  Yeah, I'm saying that facetiously.
[03:14:06.802 --> 03:14:12.166]  Do they have a COVID epidemic?
[03:14:12.166 --> 03:14:16.369]  How about Cambodia?
[03:14:16.369 --> 03:14:18.490]  No, not hardly anybody dead over there either.
[03:14:21.428 --> 03:14:25.751]  Couldn't like being out there in the sunlight's good for you, huh?
[03:14:25.751 --> 03:14:27.812]  No, we're going to be morons.
[03:14:27.812 --> 03:14:32.595]  We're imbecile, arrogant jerks.
[03:14:32.595 --> 03:14:34.476]  Poly-tics.
[03:14:34.476 --> 03:14:37.538]  I tell people, Google up the definition of politician.
[03:14:37.538 --> 03:14:42.141]  Someone who's manipulative and devious, typically to gain advancement within an organization.
[03:14:42.141 --> 03:14:44.282]  Morons, imbeciles.
[03:14:44.282 --> 03:14:49.065]  The people you hated in high school and college that wanted to be class president.
[03:14:49.065 --> 03:14:51.026]  The way they're opening up this economy
[03:14:52.025 --> 03:14:54.387]  He's only going to drag it down.
[03:14:54.387 --> 03:14:58.369]  The equity markets have nothing to do with the real world.
[03:14:58.369 --> 03:15:03.533]  You saw the numbers coming out last week on unemployment.
[03:15:03.533 --> 03:15:06.475]  And then the Labor Department admitted that that number of 14.5% unemployment is off.
[03:15:06.475 --> 03:15:07.595]  It's more like 20%.
[03:15:07.595 --> 03:15:09.016]  What was it during the Great Depression? 25%.
[03:15:22.059 --> 03:15:25.661]  The greatest depression has just begun.
[03:15:25.661 --> 03:15:29.804]  It's time to prepare for the future.
[03:15:29.804 --> 03:15:32.906]  You're leading us into hell.
[03:15:32.906 --> 03:15:39.309]  Right in front of our eyes.
[03:15:39.309 --> 03:15:43.672]  You better start getting in the best shape you can.
[03:15:43.672 --> 03:15:45.713]  Physically, spiritually, emotionally.
[03:15:45.713 --> 03:15:51.637]  And on the physical end, of course, InfoWars stores have some great products.
[03:15:54.502 --> 03:16:03.606]  And on preparing for the future, Transjournal brings you their history before it happens.
[03:16:03.606 --> 03:16:08.728]  So InfoWars, Transjournal, be prepared.
[03:16:08.728 --> 03:16:17.212]  We're going into a crisis beyond the imagination of the wildest dream.
[03:16:17.212 --> 03:16:22.434]  And if you don't believe in a wildest dream, let's go back three months ago.
[03:16:23.524 --> 03:16:30.590]  When the COVID crisis began, the first thing people did was go out and buy toilet paper.
[03:16:30.590 --> 03:16:32.432]  That's how bad it is.
[03:16:32.432 --> 03:16:34.254]  We'll be back in just a few.
[03:16:35.819 --> 03:16:46.782]  I was talking to my wife tonight and I was saying, our economy slowing down and shutting down is like shooting a deer and it runs a hundred yards before it knows it's been shot and then it finally dies.
[03:16:46.782 --> 03:16:58.685]  She said, well yeah, when I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, one time there was an argument in the street and another man shot another man in the head and the man that got shot in the head had blood pouring out a huge hole.
[03:16:58.685 --> 03:17:04.346]  He was holding it and he walked around gibbering, talking nonsense for about 60 seconds and then just fell over dead.
[03:17:05.046 --> 03:17:07.609]  Well, that's what's going to happen with our economy.
[03:17:07.609 --> 03:17:09.591]  It is in cardiac arrest.
[03:17:09.591 --> 03:17:17.839]  This has been done by design, and the UN, the chi-coms, the mainstream media orchestrated it, hyped it, and tried to keep the economy closed.
[03:17:17.839 --> 03:17:28.190]  So remember, the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on the UN, on Bill and Melinda Gates, on Obama, on Hillary, on Biden, on the Democrats.
[03:17:28.650 --> 03:17:34.731]  We tried to stop it, we tried to fight it, but you guys said you wanted to wreck America and the world, and now you've done it.
[03:17:34.731 --> 03:17:36.132]  Congratulations.
[03:17:36.132 --> 03:17:43.133]  Feudalism in the ancient world, from Asia to Europe, from Africa to Latin America, was the most common form of government.
[03:17:43.133 --> 03:17:51.675]  You had a ruling class, the nobility, the king and queen sitting on top of it, and the rest of the public were kept at a subsistence, starving level.
[03:17:52.435 --> 03:17:54.116]  For control.
[03:17:54.116 --> 03:18:05.604]  In fact, in most cultures, they called the peasants the little people because they were usually a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them, again, at a starving level.
[03:18:05.604 --> 03:18:10.007]  They were so busy trying to survive, they would never try to challenge the entrenched elite.
[03:18:10.367 --> 03:18:27.599]  Well, now all the big Google owners and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, the Jeff Bezoses of the world, they're sitting back on their giant estates with their jet helicopters and private jets, living the life, laughing at you, shut down, going bankrupt in the third world, starving to death.
[03:18:27.599 --> 03:18:33.403]  Their religion is power and control, and they are pressing that advantage against us.
[03:18:33.403 --> 03:18:35.044]  We must break free from these monsters.
[03:18:39.082 --> 03:18:42.987]  Please remember that we have a lot of great products that have been out of stock, back in stock, like krill oil.
[03:18:42.987 --> 03:18:44.149]  We have the ultimate krill oil.
[03:18:44.149 --> 03:18:47.393]  If you don't know the benefits of krill oil, it's incredible.
[03:18:47.393 --> 03:18:53.401]  Everything in your body, for your heart, your skin, your libido, your stamina, your dreams, at least before you go to sleep, it's well known.
[03:18:53.401 --> 03:18:53.962]  Experience
[03:18:54.002 --> 03:18:54.603]  We're good to go.
[03:19:15.683 --> 03:19:22.004]  Infowarsstore.com and we're already talking to our suppliers and some of them are saying we may not take orders in a few months.
[03:19:22.004 --> 03:19:24.065]  I may not ever be able to get products again.
[03:19:24.065 --> 03:19:26.145]  Things are collapsing so bad folks.
[03:19:26.145 --> 03:19:27.786]  This is total depression.
[03:19:27.786 --> 03:19:29.406]  The infrastructure is going down.
[03:19:29.406 --> 03:19:38.808]  Get the products while you still can.
[03:19:38.808 --> 03:19:41.429]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:47.045 --> 03:19:48.045]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:19:48.045 --> 03:19:52.926]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:19:52.926 --> 03:19:58.527]  Hello, hello, it's great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:16.800 --> 03:20:23.205]  I was talking about the freaks in charge.
[03:20:23.205 --> 03:20:32.092]  And then there's the media, who really started hyping this COVID-19.
[03:20:32.092 --> 03:20:38.758]  We did a story back on January 28th in the Trends Journal, the cover read, coronavirus, 106 dead in China.
[03:20:38.758 --> 03:20:40.659]  And we put 1.4 billion still alive.
[03:20:45.410 --> 03:20:50.414]  So it was the media that hyped this, and we showed how Jeff's a sucker.
[03:20:50.414 --> 03:20:56.879]  With CNN, the guy that runs the show, told his staff to keep promoting it, keep pumping it.
[03:20:56.879 --> 03:21:00.562]  And then there's the toilet paper record, the New York Times.
[03:21:00.562 --> 03:21:01.983]  You see all these marks on the paper?
[03:21:01.983 --> 03:21:02.784]  That's how I read.
[03:21:02.784 --> 03:21:07.267]  I mark up important points and stories.
[03:21:07.267 --> 03:21:08.888]  This story last week.
[03:21:08.888 --> 03:21:12.151]  Virus batters some areas.
[03:21:12.151 --> 03:21:13.392]  Why does it spare others?
[03:21:14.980 --> 03:21:20.785]  Research is hunting for patterns to explain wide variations in infection rate.
[03:21:20.785 --> 03:21:27.070]  The Dominican Republic has reported nearly 7,600 cases of the virus.
[03:21:27.070 --> 03:21:34.816]  Just across the border, Haiti has about 85.
[03:21:34.816 --> 03:21:36.997]  Okay, Haiti has about 85.
[03:21:36.997 --> 03:21:40.720]  15 dead as we speak.
[03:21:40.720 --> 03:21:42.622]  You can't get poorer than Haiti, right?
[03:21:44.346 --> 03:21:52.548]  And again, they are making this point because they're locking us down.
[03:21:52.548 --> 03:21:53.968]  And sun is good for you.
[03:21:53.968 --> 03:21:55.629]  The vitamin D facts are there.
[03:21:55.629 --> 03:22:03.210]  But here's how also the toilet paper record, they call themselves the paper record, but this thing's only good for one thing.
[03:22:03.210 --> 03:22:04.471]  It may be the next crisis.
[03:22:04.471 --> 03:22:11.913]  People will run out and get the New York Times rather than those other toilet papers.
[03:22:11.913 --> 03:22:13.673]  Many developing nations
[03:22:14.209 --> 03:22:26.198]  With hot climates and young populations have escaped the worst, suggesting that the temperatures and demographics could be factors.
[03:22:26.198 --> 03:22:43.290]  But countries like Peru, Indonesia and Brazil, tropical countries in the throes of growing epidemics, throw cold water on that idea.
[03:22:44.983 --> 03:22:48.365]  Throw cold water on that idea.
[03:22:48.365 --> 03:22:50.807]  Brazil.
[03:22:50.807 --> 03:22:51.888]  Let's see.
[03:22:51.888 --> 03:22:55.671]  Brazil has about 212 million people.
[03:22:55.671 --> 03:22:58.292]  212 million people.
[03:22:58.292 --> 03:23:02.796]  They have a grand total of 11,207 deaths as of now.
[03:23:02.796 --> 03:23:03.736]  That's no percentage at all.
[03:23:15.259 --> 03:23:21.902]  How many people got killed in those Brazilian slums yesterday or for the year so far?
[03:23:21.902 --> 03:23:33.747]  How about the other poverty issues and other illnesses affecting probably tens of millions of Brazilians?
[03:23:33.747 --> 03:23:39.050]  We won't say that, Salenti, because we're the toilet paper of record.
[03:23:39.050 --> 03:23:40.611]  The New York slime.
[03:23:40.611 --> 03:23:40.651]  Oh!
[03:23:44.608 --> 03:23:46.328]  And what other did I mention?
[03:23:46.328 --> 03:23:46.548]  Peru!
[03:23:46.548 --> 03:23:46.968]  Peru.
[03:23:46.968 --> 03:23:48.689]  33 million people.
[03:23:48.689 --> 03:23:50.109]  7,887 deaths.
[03:23:50.109 --> 03:23:51.969]  Out of 30 million people.
[03:23:51.969 --> 03:23:55.370]  Or 33 million.
[03:23:55.370 --> 03:23:56.970]  And how about the poverty issues over there?
[03:23:56.970 --> 03:23:57.370]  In Peru?
[03:23:57.370 --> 03:24:03.811]  How about the other things that are bringing people down?
[03:24:15.350 --> 03:24:20.171]  And like, maybe they're doing what they're doing in the United States.
[03:24:20.171 --> 03:24:22.612]  And I'm not making this up.
[03:24:22.612 --> 03:24:37.975]  Matter of fact, they tried to make fun of it and call it a conspiracy theory as this clown that America loves so much, the guy that plays the greatest health expert in the world, this guy Fauci.
[03:24:37.975 --> 03:24:40.396]  Fauci means jaw in Italian.
[03:24:40.396 --> 03:24:44.217]  And all this little boy is doing is jawboning that Fauci jaw, yeah.
[03:24:45.489 --> 03:25:09.757]  He made fun of this Dr. Jensen from Michigan who's noted that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have added, quote, presumed cause of death even if a diagnosis is not confirmed by a test.
[03:25:17.165 --> 03:25:19.285]  Isn't that something?
[03:25:19.285 --> 03:25:20.646]  Presumed.
[03:25:20.646 --> 03:25:23.606]  We don't have to test you.
[03:25:23.606 --> 03:25:36.729]  So going back to the numbers in Colombia, even at 11,000, how many had been tested?
[03:25:36.729 --> 03:25:40.510]  Then we go to Indonesia, they mentioned.
[03:25:40.510 --> 03:25:41.910]  Oh, Indonesia.
[03:25:41.910 --> 03:25:43.851]  Hmm.
[03:25:43.851 --> 03:25:45.751]  Indonesia.
[03:25:45.751 --> 03:25:46.131]  You ready?
[03:25:47.261 --> 03:25:47.541]  273,526,000 deaths.
[03:25:47.541 --> 03:25:50.683]  They have a grand total of 911 deaths.
[03:25:50.683 --> 03:25:51.144]  That's right.
[03:25:51.144 --> 03:25:52.465]  911 deaths.
[03:25:52.465 --> 03:25:52.965]  In a country
[03:26:16.157 --> 03:26:23.143]  Of 274 million people.
[03:26:23.143 --> 03:26:37.776]  Yet, the toilet paper pumps this up as though it's a mystery of who's dying.
[03:26:37.776 --> 03:26:42.239]  The facts are in the numbers.
[03:26:42.239 --> 03:26:44.061]  The Kaiser Health Foundation
[03:26:45.728 --> 03:27:02.640]  Came out and said between a half to 30% of the deaths in America are from chronically ill people from nursing homes.
[03:27:02.640 --> 03:27:15.509]  The other facts, documented facts, in your Trends Journal, and I'm sure they've said it on InfoWars, obesity,
[03:27:18.680 --> 03:27:34.433]  Diabetics, people suffering from lung disease, heart ailments, respiratory problems, people that are chronically ill are the ones that are going.
[03:27:34.433 --> 03:27:36.835]  These are facts.
[03:27:36.835 --> 03:27:42.800]  The obesity numbers are real, as are the other ones, diabetics, lung disease.
[03:27:42.800 --> 03:27:44.862]  Healthy people aren't dying of this.
[03:27:48.900 --> 03:28:16.131]  In the reporting from Associated Press, they keep mentioning over and over that, quote, in their articles, after they report something, in the middle of it, for most people, the coronavirus causes mild or modest symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two or three weeks.
[03:28:17.042 --> 03:28:30.807]  For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe life-threatening illnesses, including pneumonia and death.
[03:28:30.807 --> 03:28:32.307]  Alright?
[03:28:32.307 --> 03:28:34.628]  That's who's dying.
[03:28:34.628 --> 03:28:42.331]  However, the economic devastation brought to the United States
[03:28:44.045 --> 03:28:58.597]  Of America with a K in there, take out the C because we've become the Nazi Stasi state and a combination of the Soviet Union and China.
[03:28:58.597 --> 03:29:08.526]  With the loss of our freedoms, our Bill of Rights, our Constitution robbed from us.
[03:29:08.526 --> 03:29:09.687]  All the facts are there.
[03:29:11.084 --> 03:29:15.208]  But all they do is keep selling fear and hype.
[03:29:15.208 --> 03:29:18.350]  Just like they did after 9-11.
[03:29:18.350 --> 03:29:21.653]  Coronavirus 9-11.
[03:29:21.653 --> 03:29:25.877]  That was one of our other Trans Journal covers.
[03:29:25.877 --> 03:29:27.819]  Selling terror.
[03:29:27.819 --> 03:29:30.281]  And they've terrorized the people.
[03:29:30.281 --> 03:29:31.883]  But we're born to be free.
[03:29:31.883 --> 03:29:34.185]  And that's why we're on InfoWars.
[03:29:35.512 --> 03:29:44.563]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chi-coms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[03:29:44.563 --> 03:29:48.527]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world.
[03:29:49.192 --> 03:29:55.739]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going to be.
[03:29:55.739 --> 03:30:01.706]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy.
[03:30:01.706 --> 03:30:10.175]  That's why we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[03:30:11.016 --> 03:30:12.898]  They've admitted all of this.
[03:30:12.898 --> 03:30:20.525]  So remember, how does Infowars continue years and decades, in many cases, to be able to predict things before they happen?
[03:30:20.525 --> 03:30:24.709]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan.
[03:30:24.709 --> 03:30:25.930]  And yes, it's dystopic.
[03:30:25.930 --> 03:30:27.191]  And yes, it's scary.
[03:30:27.191 --> 03:30:31.415]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[03:30:31.415 --> 03:30:34.418]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[03:30:34.898 --> 03:30:39.480]  I don't have to tell you that we are in the most important point in human history.
[03:30:39.480 --> 03:30:42.662]  The globalists have taken the gloves off, and they've taken the mask off.
[03:30:42.662 --> 03:30:45.683]  And they're like, yeah, you're taking implantable chips.
[03:30:45.683 --> 03:30:47.464]  Yeah, we're into pedophilia.
[03:30:47.464 --> 03:30:49.225]  Yeah, we're into world government.
[03:30:49.225 --> 03:30:51.106]  Yeah, you're obsolete.
[03:30:51.106 --> 03:30:52.147]  You are non-essential.
[03:30:53.127 --> 03:30:54.949]  We are shutting your ass down.
[03:30:54.949 --> 03:30:59.793]  Yeah, we told you don't be farmers and don't be ranchers and don't work in industry anymore.
[03:30:59.793 --> 03:31:01.474]  You're going to be the service economy.
[03:31:01.474 --> 03:31:06.858]  And now the globalists are telling you that there's no more service economy and you're obsolete.
[03:31:06.858 --> 03:31:11.983]  So you better bow down to them and get your universal pittance income so they can dictate your life.
[03:31:12.563 --> 03:31:15.166]  The handcuffs are going on right now.
[03:31:15.166 --> 03:31:17.848]  We have to resist and say no to the New World Order.
[03:31:17.848 --> 03:31:20.531]  And that takes you understanding you were right.
[03:31:20.531 --> 03:31:22.032]  And understanding I was right.
[03:31:22.032 --> 03:31:26.776]  And getting in people's faces and raising the alarm now while you still can.
[03:31:26.776 --> 03:31:28.578]  Now is the time for action.
[03:31:28.578 --> 03:31:30.400]  Now is the time for you to shine.
[03:31:30.400 --> 03:31:32.382]  And be the Paul Revere's you know you are.
[03:31:36.710 --> 03:31:40.373]  It's time to take a new, healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.

[03:32:36.182 --> 03:32:42.065]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy to where it is.
[03:32:42.765 --> 03:32:58.289]  Every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months, it is going to be a death sentence to the third world, and a horrible, nightmarish collapse for the first world, and that the general public is going to go into deep, deep debt to the megabanks.
[03:32:58.289 --> 03:33:01.970]  They're not going to have medical ID cards, forced inoculation.
[03:33:01.970 --> 03:33:05.251]  We are now in a giant dystopia.
[03:33:05.831 --> 03:33:24.821]  But a lot of people are waking up, and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny, and we must all rediscover our Bill of Rights, rediscover our Constitution and our backbone, and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say, shut your business down, shut your life down, it'll save lives.
[03:33:24.821 --> 03:33:25.341]  No.
[03:33:25.341 --> 03:33:29.423]  It's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions more.
[03:33:29.423 --> 03:33:34.285]  So the cowards who went along with this with your virtue signaling, you have destroyed your lives and our lives.
[03:33:34.285 --> 03:33:35.146]  Congratulations.
[03:33:38.436 --> 03:33:55.444]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.

[03:35:47.788 --> 03:35:52.070]  Before they sell out again of this incredible 50% off deal.
[03:35:52.070 --> 03:35:57.172]  That's Infowarslife.com.
[03:35:57.172 --> 03:36:06.076]  So, again, put your money where your heart is, because you can see how they're trying to censor us.
[03:36:06.076 --> 03:36:13.259]  Again, I read to you the New York Times, how they go after people, make statements without facts.
[03:36:13.259 --> 03:36:17.161]  It went after that Dr. Jensen, from him saying that
[03:36:18.899 --> 03:36:30.607]  What they were doing is putting suspected deaths in as COVID deaths without testing.
[03:36:30.607 --> 03:36:39.913]  And also they did that because when somebody dies of COVID in the hospital, they get more money.
[03:36:39.913 --> 03:36:41.734]  That's right.
[03:36:41.734 --> 03:36:43.635]  And I'm not making that up.
[03:36:43.635 --> 03:36:46.737]  In fact, even USA Today did a story on that one.
[03:36:48.268 --> 03:36:57.292]  So we're looking here at what's going on, what's real, and what they're telling us.
[03:36:57.292 --> 03:37:11.739]  And when you look at the facts, you can see how easy it is to send people to war based on lies, because that's all they're doing again is selling us more and more lies.
[03:37:11.739 --> 03:37:17.602]  Alex Jones is saying on that piece of intro, some of the
[03:37:18.680 --> 03:37:20.561]  Products that are being sold.
[03:37:20.561 --> 03:37:24.202]  About how this economy is going down so badly.
[03:37:24.202 --> 03:37:26.643]  As I said, we're going into the greatest depression.
[03:37:26.643 --> 03:37:32.985]  This is going to be worse than the Great Depression.
[03:37:32.985 --> 03:37:36.326]  Neiman Marcus seeks bankruptcy protection.
[03:37:36.326 --> 03:37:37.866]  This is last week.
[03:37:37.866 --> 03:37:42.248]  Virus spurs bankruptcy for Canadian chain.
[03:37:42.248 --> 03:37:44.969]  Aldo Group.
[03:37:44.969 --> 03:37:45.989]  That was last Thursday.
[03:37:48.186 --> 03:37:54.110]  Up to 15% of Rolls-Royce jobs face acts in planned shake-up.
[03:37:54.110 --> 03:38:02.636]  Virgin Atlantic to slash a third of staff and leave Gatwick, which they've been there for some 35 years.
[03:38:02.636 --> 03:38:10.021]  Glassdoor, crash, they're laying off 30% of their staff.
[03:38:10.021 --> 03:38:15.565]  Raytheon to cut costs $2 billion, furlough staff.
[03:38:17.219 --> 03:38:24.825]  EU forecasts a sharp slide into recession.
[03:38:24.825 --> 03:38:27.607]  Euro weakens after Germans.
[03:38:27.607 --> 03:38:28.468]  Oh, that's a different one.
[03:38:28.468 --> 03:38:29.229]  I'll talk about that.
[03:38:29.229 --> 03:38:32.271]  Germans challenge on ECB stimulus.
[03:38:32.271 --> 03:38:39.297]  Eurozone stability falters under pandemic impact, warns Brussels.
[03:38:39.297 --> 03:38:41.839]  It's not the pandemic impact.
[03:38:41.839 --> 03:38:45.622]  It's the impact brought to us by demented
[03:38:46.075 --> 03:38:48.376]  Politicians.
[03:38:48.376 --> 03:38:54.880]  By psychopaths, sociopaths, and pathological liars.
[03:38:54.880 --> 03:38:59.903]  It's not the coronavirus that did this.
[03:38:59.903 --> 03:39:03.245]  It's the sick people in charge.
[03:39:03.245 --> 03:39:13.512]  Again, going back to the United States, and going back to the other countries I was talking about, like a place like Haiti, where poverty is rampant, and they only have 35 or 19 deaths
[03:39:19.392 --> 03:39:30.155]  America's suffering from obesity, and that's one of the major causes of death other than the elderly in nursing homes.
[03:39:30.155 --> 03:39:33.936]  42% of Americans are obese.
[03:39:33.936 --> 03:39:39.197]  70% are overweight.
[03:39:39.197 --> 03:39:43.939]  And then there's smoking-related diseases that are adding up to this.
[03:39:43.939 --> 03:39:48.580]  Again, quarantine the ill, free the healthy.
[03:39:52.837 --> 03:40:01.443]  Eurozone recovery will take three years, warns European Central Bank economist.
[03:40:01.443 --> 03:40:09.829]  Mortgage-backed debt under pressure as hotel owners fail to make payments.
[03:40:09.829 --> 03:40:13.952]  Look at the stupid freaks that are making up these things.
[03:40:13.952 --> 03:40:17.775]  Now when you get on an airplane, you have to wear a mask.
[03:40:17.775 --> 03:40:19.556]  Isn't it fun to fly already?
[03:40:19.556 --> 03:40:21.518]  You get felt up when you go to the airport.
[03:40:21.837 --> 03:40:23.739]  And they pack you in like sardines.
[03:40:23.739 --> 03:40:31.105]  Of course, I go back to the days when flying was fun.
[03:40:31.105 --> 03:40:32.886]  Yeah.
[03:40:32.886 --> 03:40:37.310]  Anyway, now you gotta wear masks.
[03:40:37.310 --> 03:40:43.655]  Won't it be fun to eat and drink with masks and to socially distance?
[03:40:43.655 --> 03:40:47.198]  The tourism business is, it's hit hard.
[03:40:47.198 --> 03:40:49.420]  I gotta tell you, man,
[03:40:50.140 --> 03:40:52.981]  Trump is really taking a hit on this too.
[03:40:52.981 --> 03:40:59.044]  All them hotels at Mar-a-Lago and one down in D.C.
[03:40:59.044 --> 03:41:03.486]  that was doing booming business.
[03:41:03.486 --> 03:41:07.348]  So this is hurting a lot of people up and down the line.
[03:41:07.348 --> 03:41:13.791]  This isn't going to come back.
[03:41:13.791 --> 03:41:15.492]  What else do we have here?
[03:41:15.492 --> 03:41:16.753]  Ah, virus threats.
[03:41:18.426 --> 03:41:22.088]  10 billion euro hit to footballers' value.
[03:41:22.088 --> 03:41:26.131]  These are the teams out there, just like the ones in the United States.
[03:41:26.131 --> 03:41:29.513]  People aren't going to want to go to stadiums.
[03:41:29.513 --> 03:41:31.314]  Music industry?
[03:41:31.314 --> 03:41:34.476]  Our musicians are struggling even in the best of time.
[03:41:34.476 --> 03:41:37.878]  And now they're out of work.
[03:41:37.878 --> 03:41:47.104]  And now these moron, jerk, imbecile, low-life pieces of garbage crap, politicians, politics, sucking the blood out of us, make up stuff.
[03:41:47.827 --> 03:41:50.389]  This is from the Wall Street Journal.
[03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:54.251]  Berlin moves to reopen nation's economy.
[03:41:54.251 --> 03:42:03.997]  They manage some restaurants will be permitted to open by end of May if they keep tables six and a half feet apart.
[03:42:03.997 --> 03:42:04.698]  Oh, yeah, great.
[03:42:04.698 --> 03:42:06.059]  Who's making up six?
[03:42:06.059 --> 03:42:09.121]  I say six feet.
[03:42:09.121 --> 03:42:11.102]  Twelve inches.
[03:42:11.102 --> 03:42:12.363]  No, no.
[03:42:12.363 --> 03:42:13.724]  Six and a half feet.
[03:42:13.724 --> 03:42:14.084]  No, no, no.
[03:42:15.706 --> 03:42:16.627]  All right?
[03:42:16.627 --> 03:42:18.028]  You're making this crap up.
[03:42:18.028 --> 03:42:21.350]  You ready?
[03:42:21.350 --> 03:42:24.672]  Many restrictions will remain.
[03:42:24.672 --> 03:42:35.640]  Only people from no more than two separate households will be allowed to meet outside their home between now and June 5th.
[03:42:35.640 --> 03:42:40.003]  People will have to keep about six feet apart when outside.
[03:42:40.003 --> 03:42:42.265]  Hey, wait a minute.
[03:42:42.265 --> 03:42:43.966]  In America, six feet apart.
[03:42:43.966 --> 03:42:45.247]  Why five feet apart?
[03:42:47.681 --> 03:42:49.782]  Belgium.
[03:42:49.782 --> 03:43:05.008]  Families and friends would be allowed to meet again under one roof, but only under a maximum of four guests for each home, and always with the same people.
[03:43:05.008 --> 03:43:08.430]  You're making this crap up!
[03:43:08.430 --> 03:43:13.712]  You can't- this is a grade B movie!
[03:43:13.712 --> 03:43:14.032]  This is-
[03:43:14.707 --> 03:43:18.049]  Yeah, they got a farmer's market out here now and they used to be on the street.
[03:43:18.049 --> 03:43:22.152]  They put it in the parking lot across the street, the county office building.
[03:43:22.152 --> 03:43:25.534]  You got to give your name before you go there.
[03:43:25.534 --> 03:43:28.596]  You got to wear a mask.
[03:43:28.596 --> 03:43:31.158]  And you have to be six foot apart.
[03:43:31.158 --> 03:43:32.799]  The wind is blowing everywhere.
[03:43:32.799 --> 03:43:37.742]  Oh, you don't wear a mask, mask.
[03:43:37.742 --> 03:43:42.125]  You can wear a bandana, you can wear... They're making this stuff up.
[03:43:42.125 --> 03:43:43.046]  The wind is blowing.
[03:43:44.414 --> 03:43:51.139]  These masks aren't, and what some organizations are saying, you shouldn't be wearing masks.
[03:43:51.139 --> 03:43:53.922]  No, you're a conspiracy theorist to say that.
[03:43:53.922 --> 03:43:56.183]  They don't know what they're doing.
[03:43:56.183 --> 03:44:04.430]  They have destroyed our lives, destroyed joy, beauty, love, and liberty, and they've destroyed the global economy.
[03:44:04.430 --> 03:44:06.792]  The Greatest Depression has begun.
[03:44:06.792 --> 03:44:08.713]  You better prepare now.
[03:44:08.713 --> 03:44:11.656]  Stock up with InfoWars.
[03:44:11.656 --> 03:44:13.077]  Be prepared for the future.
