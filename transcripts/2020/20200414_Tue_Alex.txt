[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:05.110]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:20.594]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have a feeling today's Alex Jones Show is going to be pivotal information dispersed today.
[00:00:22.514 --> 00:00:27.095]  And yeah, it'll be important for you to hear this and share this, but most of it you already know.
[00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:38.847]  It's going to be more pivotal for the White House to hear this, for President Trump to hear this, and understand it's time to make a move.
[00:00:39.647 --> 00:00:44.048]  The traitors among us have been fully exposed, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:00:44.108 --> 00:00:51.190]  Now look, I'm going to tell you what's going on here at InfoWars today and what you can expect coming up.
[00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.872]  Alex Jones meant to take a short trip, get out of the hurricane for a minute,
[00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:01.770]  Recharge the batteries, we all need that.
[00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.971]  Quite frankly, I wish Alex could do it.
[00:01:04.752 --> 00:01:06.633]  But, wild horses couldn't drag him away.
[00:01:06.993 --> 00:01:08.894]  They're actually dragging him back into studio.
[00:01:10.275 --> 00:01:14.877]  So, Alex Jones is on his way back into studio and he's got breaking news.
[00:01:16.378 --> 00:01:18.620]  Now, I don't even know what his breaking news is.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.244]  I've been like a busy beaver last night and tonight with a lot of the new information that was coming in yesterday.
[00:01:28.331 --> 00:01:39.179]  But then, this morning, tying it into what we already know, and then it was like... You know how, when you're driving down a highway, like 6, 7 in the morning, and the fog is there?
[00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:51.748]  But the longer you drive, and maybe you get to higher ground, and then the fog clears, and it's a beautiful, sunny day, and you can see the dew on the blades of grass, uh, grass, and the crisp...
[00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:55.300]  Air with the sun beaming down.
[00:01:56.361 --> 00:02:14.214]  It was so clear to me and what I discovered with mainstream media, American academia and the Democrat Party, 110% never been clearer, never been more exposed.
[00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:17.336]  Chinese communist agents.
[00:02:18.388 --> 00:02:24.031]  At worst, colluding with the Chinese Communist Party at best.
[00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:29.954]  110% connections have been made, it's all out there, deep state, fully exposed, ties to China.
[00:02:31.675 --> 00:02:46.302]  And then I'm getting more intel coming in today that I'm trying to back check, that not only are we sitting here watching the full rollout of Bill Gates, 7.5 billion vaccines for the whole world,
[00:02:47.461 --> 00:02:51.624]  Everything goes on to his Zoom platform and how that all ties into China.
[00:02:53.566 --> 00:02:59.731]  But also how Fauci was using Bill and Melinda Gates models
[00:03:01.454 --> 00:03:06.615]  And Bill and Melinda Gates propaganda to roll out his entire response to this.
[00:03:07.155 --> 00:03:08.876]  And again, I'm checking on this.
[00:03:08.956 --> 00:03:09.936]  This would be breaking now.
[00:03:11.156 --> 00:03:15.758]  The White House is now pulling away from those models and using real-time data.
[00:03:16.378 --> 00:03:21.499]  But that's probably going to be a story for tomorrow, quite frankly, the way this news is developing.
[00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:25.320]  But folks, they're not even hiding it anymore.
[00:03:26.977 --> 00:03:33.842]  Direct Democrat connections to the Chinese Communist Party, fully exposed, and they're still trying to go with it.
[00:03:35.784 --> 00:03:51.176]  You have media connections to the Chinese Communist Party, fully exposed after yesterday's lambasting, scorch fest, President Trump against the anti-American mainstream news, and then
[00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:05.324]  The ties from the Obama administration selling these bioweapon research viruses to the Chinese government.
[00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:07.847]  And I got it all right here, folks.
[00:04:08.328 --> 00:04:09.589]  I got it all tied together.
[00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:11.732]  It cannot be denied.
[00:04:11.872 --> 00:04:13.554]  It's time for the president to take action.
[00:04:15.043 --> 00:04:31.509]  I'm gonna do my due diligence and hopefully I can even get to that with whatever breaking news Alex Jones has coming up as well as he has canceled yet another trip to come in here and deliver the breaking news that he has for you today.
[00:04:31.549 --> 00:04:32.009]  But folks,
[00:04:33.837 --> 00:04:51.162]  The average American that wasn't involved in politics or red-pilled or knew about any of this stuff is now looking squarely at Bill Gates, looking squarely at the CDC and the WHO and the Chinese Communists, and their middle finger is starting to get exposed.
[00:04:54.935 --> 00:04:59.860]  Alex Jones here on this Tuesday, April 14th, worldwide broadcast.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.281]  Owen Schroeder is about to take over.
[00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.283]  I'll be back in studio live next hour.
[00:05:04.063 --> 00:05:10.929]  But as predicted, the globalist takedown of the West and America is proceeding according to their plan.
[00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.894]  As we've been telling you since before, the artificial shutdown, when Trump
[00:05:17.304 --> 00:05:18.807]  Tries to reopen the economy.
[00:05:19.127 --> 00:05:27.381]  The leftist controlled states of California and New York and their satellite neighbors, their axis of loose state corruption.
[00:05:28.612 --> 00:05:33.433]  We'll then hold the states hostage and say we're not going to reopen.
[00:05:33.593 --> 00:05:41.394]  Major globalist corporations will also refuse to reopen, along with blue cities in red states.
[00:05:42.315 --> 00:05:45.895]  This is being called an alliance of the West Coast and the East Coast.
[00:05:46.615 --> 00:05:53.737]  This is a globalist-financed, globalist-run civil war inside the United States
[00:05:54.867 --> 00:05:56.271]  America was almost done.
[00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:57.273]  We've been sold out to China.
[00:05:57.293 --> 00:05:58.376]  We were industrialized.
[00:05:58.396 --> 00:05:59.519]  We're being set up for a race war.
[00:06:00.711 --> 00:06:05.894]  The American people rallied, we got Trump in, he turned the economy back on, showed people it was artificial suppression.
[00:06:06.755 --> 00:06:19.063]  They tried to remove him as a Russian agent, then as the Ukrainian corruption, and as impeachment they knew was failing, they launched COVID-19 that is an engineered bioweapon, but still not as deadly as they're saying it is.
[00:06:19.323 --> 00:06:25.567]  They know the trajectory of it, and they know it'll come back year after year, so they're saying it's a permanent shutdown that has to be cycled.
[00:06:26.698 --> 00:06:27.038]  I don't
[00:06:47.176 --> 00:06:47.716]  I don't know.
[00:07:15.084 --> 00:07:15.844]  Does not exist.
[00:07:16.484 --> 00:07:19.885]  So the power to control the economy is the power to destroy.
[00:07:19.905 --> 00:07:22.226]  The power to tax is the power to destroy.
[00:07:22.886 --> 00:07:26.827]  And we are seeing America and the West brought to its knees by the globalists.
[00:07:27.147 --> 00:07:28.508]  How dare you want sovereignty?
[00:07:28.548 --> 00:07:29.908]  How dare you want prosperity?
[00:07:30.408 --> 00:07:31.968]  How dare you want all of this?
[00:07:32.949 --> 00:07:34.509]  How dare you not turn your guns in?
[00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:37.030]  How dare you not sterilize your sons?
[00:07:38.132 --> 00:07:40.173]  And so now they're moving ahead.
[00:07:40.593 --> 00:07:47.817]  The next phase will be trying to remove the president during the depression that they'll blame on him because he still doesn't control the Justice Department.
[00:07:48.818 --> 00:07:55.222]  And they will then also accelerate the prosecution of talk show hosts and people loyal to the president.
[00:07:56.062 --> 00:08:04.467]  I've obviously been told, as I've been telling you the last few months, that I will be indicted by federal and state grand juries in the near future.
[00:08:06.127 --> 00:08:13.152]  I've been told you will roll over against Trump or we will destroy you either with these lawsuits or we will find a way to indict you.
[00:08:14.232 --> 00:08:17.374]  And Democrats walk me in the street and they go, you're going to get arrested.
[00:08:18.135 --> 00:08:23.478]  Because these are authoritarians, folks, and they can have a grand jury indict a ham sandwich.
[00:08:23.518 --> 00:08:25.720]  So understand, they think you're cowards.
[00:08:26.590 --> 00:08:46.203]  And they think that when you see talk show hosts indicted, and you see more Trump supporters like Senator Paul with his ribs kicked in, and you see Congressman Scalise shot up at that baseball game, and you're going to see a lot more of that by the left, they think that as all of that unfolds,
[00:08:47.130 --> 00:08:51.613]  That you're just going to roll over in total abject fear.
[00:08:52.294 --> 00:08:53.635]  They think you're a bunch of cowards.
[00:08:54.295 --> 00:09:02.421]  That you're going to be overwhelmed by the, quote, authorities at the UN, the World Health Organization, telling you when you can leave your house and what you can do.
[00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:12.008]  And then, as you see the tyranny rolling behind this, that you'll stand down during the unending crisis, the unending emergency.
[00:09:12.888 --> 00:09:14.930]  That with it, carries a depression.
[00:09:15.649 --> 00:09:30.238]  But you see, those that are loyal to the bureaucracy controlled by the foreign megabanks and the bureaucrats of the UN backed up by the industrial giant China, you will still have your jobs for now because you will subserve.
[00:09:30.898 --> 00:09:31.879]  You will bow.
[00:09:32.019 --> 00:09:33.340]  You will grovel like good slaves.
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:48.005]  And then we're off the edge of the cliff and real tyranny and the Venezuelization, the North Korea-ization, the Chi-com-ization, the Soviet-ization, the true tyranny can begin.
[00:09:48.705 --> 00:09:53.047]  So make no mistake, ladies and gentlemen, read the headlines for yourself.
[00:09:53.087 --> 00:09:56.728]  States unite on reopening economies.
[00:09:57.878 --> 00:09:59.479]  Perfect double speak from NPR.
[00:09:59.819 --> 00:10:02.960]  Science, not politics, will guide decisions.
[00:10:03.461 --> 00:10:07.823]  The scientific dictatorship that Eisenhower warned of that tells you the way it is.
[00:10:08.303 --> 00:10:23.490]  The governors of New York and California, two of the largest economies in the U.S., have formed alliances with respective alliances with states and neighbors to coordinate an eventual easing of COVID-19 shutdowns.
[00:10:24.537 --> 00:10:24.958]  I think?
[00:10:39.637 --> 00:10:42.199]  That literally under Obama allowed us to transfer to China.
[00:10:42.239 --> 00:10:43.139]  That's mainstream news.
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:45.081]  Now China's come out and said, don't blame us.
[00:10:45.501 --> 00:10:49.483]  Obama and the NIH and Fauci gave it to us in 2012, 2015.
[00:10:50.044 --> 00:10:58.549]  If we don't listen to the very people that are holding us hostage, if we don't listen to the very people that have taken over our society, well, then the economy will never reopen.
[00:10:59.470 --> 00:11:05.694]  With separate announcements, the governor said they agreed to let science, not politics, determine when to lift the
[00:11:06.761 --> 00:11:08.283]  Social and business restrictions.
[00:11:08.823 --> 00:11:16.711]  Any plan to reopen society must be driven by data and experts and not opinion and policies, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said.
[00:11:17.031 --> 00:11:19.133]  And of course, Newsom said the exact same thing.
[00:11:19.714 --> 00:11:29.484]  Of course, remember that Cuomo just came out a couple days ago and said that all the projections were wrong and were 9, 10, 15 times higher than what's really done.
[00:11:30.626 --> 00:11:31.046]  They don't care.
[00:11:31.086 --> 00:11:32.487]  They're still going ahead with all this.
[00:11:32.567 --> 00:11:36.148]  Even if it was 100,000 dead by now, we shouldn't allow the total shutdown.
[00:11:36.188 --> 00:11:37.029]  It's unconstitutional.
[00:11:37.349 --> 00:11:39.249]  And the First Amendment violation is shutting down the churches.
[00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:42.111]  But that's where all this is going.
[00:11:42.171 --> 00:11:46.032]  So America is fighting for its very heart, fighting for its very soul.
[00:11:46.472 --> 00:11:50.194]  I'm going to play the Cuomo clip here in a moment, but first I'm going to play
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:12:00.325]  Bill Gates saying just a few days ago that we're going to vaccinate everybody on the planet, and it's going to hurt and maim and, you know, obviously kill 700,000 people.
[00:12:00.365 --> 00:12:05.868]  So it will lead government to indemnify the companies and corporations that carry out the inoculations.
[00:12:05.908 --> 00:12:10.691]  So they're telling you, they're coming at you with his numbers of a vaccine that only hurts one in 10,000.
[00:12:10.731 --> 00:12:18.095]  Well, anybody that's had vaccines knows that it hurts a lot of people and lowers everybody's immunity and has a lot of Trojan horse garbage added to it.
[00:12:18.655 --> 00:12:20.196]  So this is a tyrannical takeover.
[00:12:21.201 --> 00:12:23.824]  I am proud to have stood against these individuals.
[00:12:24.745 --> 00:12:27.848]  I am proud to have stood against their takeover.
[00:12:28.128 --> 00:12:32.373]  We've rallied a lot of people together, and I salute the listeners, and I say God bless you all.
[00:12:33.193 --> 00:12:36.417]  But these are the times that try men's souls, so please pray for him for worse.
[00:12:36.777 --> 00:12:38.119]  Please pray for myself and the crew.
[00:12:38.399 --> 00:12:39.280]  Please pray for America.
[00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.461]  Please pray for President Trump.
[00:12:40.861 --> 00:12:41.882]  Trump is the real deal.
[00:12:41.922 --> 00:12:42.843]  He's totally surrounded.
[00:12:43.504 --> 00:12:43.965]  I don't
[00:13:05.405 --> 00:13:07.106]  America can only come up from here.
[00:13:07.547 --> 00:13:10.109]  We've got to start saying no to this mind control.
[00:13:10.469 --> 00:13:14.552]  We've got to start saying no to the endless emergency, the permanent martial law.
[00:13:14.812 --> 00:13:18.375]  We've got to find our soul again and find out who we are and find our courage.
[00:13:18.735 --> 00:13:20.256]  They can't take you all down.
[00:13:20.537 --> 00:13:21.717]  They can't arrest you all.
[00:13:22.478 --> 00:13:26.282]  Well, they let the murderers and rapists out of jails and try to put the patriots in jail.
[00:13:26.582 --> 00:13:29.706]  They can't intimidate everybody, and somebody's got to stand up to them.
[00:13:30.226 --> 00:13:31.187]  And I'm not intimidated.
[00:13:31.267 --> 00:13:33.750]  I'm going to do the right thing until the end, and I will not be silenced.
[00:13:34.191 --> 00:13:39.736]  I will expose the deep state that produced this bioweapon and transferred it to China to do exactly what they're doing now.
[00:13:39.776 --> 00:13:41.518]  They were planning to do this whether Trump got in or not.
[00:13:42.279 --> 00:13:43.100]  This was the takedown.
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:44.080]  This was the global government.
[00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:45.441]  This was the worldwide medical tyranny.
[00:13:45.641 --> 00:13:47.042]  This is everything we exposed.
[00:13:47.662 --> 00:13:49.803]  Please, please, please take action.
[00:13:50.164 --> 00:13:51.524]  Please tell everyone to tune in right now.
[00:13:52.045 --> 00:13:53.786]  This is the Modern Paul Revere Transmission.
[00:13:54.938 --> 00:14:01.160]  And if you're watching and listening, you are the hope, you are the future, you are the resistance, you are the spirit of 1776.
[00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:06.763]  The efficacy of vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge.
[00:14:06.963 --> 00:14:11.484]  You know, it turns out the flu vaccine isn't that effective in elderly people.
[00:14:11.724 --> 00:14:18.827]  We clearly need a vaccine that works in the upper age range because they're most at risk of that.
[00:14:19.167 --> 00:14:23.569]  And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people and yet
[00:14:24.204 --> 00:14:26.585]  What a time to be alive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:57.079 --> 00:15:21.190]  The enemies of America have been fully exposed and they've exposed themselves by fighting back or trying to stymie or stop this American Revolution 2.0 that's happening, this resurgence of patriotism under President Donald Trump that's happening, this
[00:15:23.118 --> 00:15:26.301]  Ignition of the US economy under President Trump.
[00:15:26.401 --> 00:15:27.942]  They're trying to stop all of it.
[00:15:28.342 --> 00:15:29.984]  They've pulled out all the stops.
[00:15:32.586 --> 00:15:34.787]  And now they've been fully exposed.
[00:15:36.028 --> 00:15:45.436]  And I'm about to lay out for you how academia, media, and politics
[00:15:46.496 --> 00:15:59.384]  Have all been corrupted by the Chinese communists and it's sitting right in front of our face and we have at least one senator who is ready and willing to act.
[00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:03.067]  But let's take a look at this cut and dry.
[00:16:05.448 --> 00:16:14.254]  How Chinese agents are trying to manipulate the will
[00:16:16.201 --> 00:16:19.563]  And the fate of the United States of America.
[00:16:20.763 --> 00:16:26.146]  Let's start in politics with Adam Schiff.
[00:16:27.447 --> 00:16:44.456]  Now, we all know Adam Schiff, the dirtbag, pencil-necked, demon, fraud, liar, who is friends with Ed Buck, who has a rape drug orgy where dead men turn up.
[00:16:45.091 --> 00:16:46.833]  Yeah, Adam Schiff hangs out with that guy.
[00:16:48.535 --> 00:16:50.638]  Yes, the Adam Schiff that made up Russian collusion.
[00:16:51.238 --> 00:16:56.965]  Yes, the Adam Schiff that has committed every fiber of his being to destroying America and President Trump.
[00:16:56.985 --> 00:17:02.191]  Well, Adam Schiff has now fully exposed himself, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:17:02.211 --> 00:17:02.792]  Let me explain.
[00:17:05.899 --> 00:17:07.580]  Headline from Michael Isikoff.
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:10.861]  Now, again, it's key to know all these names and players.
[00:17:10.881 --> 00:17:11.782]  Who is Michael Isikoff?
[00:17:12.142 --> 00:17:14.823]  Deep state agent working inside the media for decades.
[00:17:15.703 --> 00:17:19.605]  Spiked the Monica Lewinsky story for the Clintons.
[00:17:20.706 --> 00:17:25.528]  Started the Russian collusion story, which was then used to get a FISA warrant.
[00:17:25.828 --> 00:17:27.569]  Yes, same guy.
[00:17:28.529 --> 00:17:32.371]  And then he publishes this for Yahoo just, I think, two days ago or even yesterday.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:39.963]  Adam Schiff says intelligence committee may conduct Zoom hearings during coronavirus pandemic.
[00:17:41.184 --> 00:17:42.384]  So what is Adam Schiff saying?
[00:17:42.424 --> 00:17:43.925]  Well, we can't meet in person.
[00:17:43.945 --> 00:17:46.766]  We shut down everything and we're making people social distance.
[00:17:46.786 --> 00:17:48.647]  So we'll do digital meetings on Zoom.
[00:17:48.727 --> 00:17:49.508]  Well, what is Zoom?
[00:17:49.548 --> 00:18:00.113]  Of course, it's a Microsoft product that Bill Gates is now pushing to further enrich himself and empower himself in his attempt at a 100% totalitarian surveillance grid.
[00:18:01.766 --> 00:18:11.052]  But so why now is Adam Schiff shifting Intelligence Committee meetings to the Zoom platform?
[00:18:11.573 --> 00:18:20.018]  Well, let me go through a series of headlines here that are all actually from before Adam Schiff's announcement.
[00:18:21.099 --> 00:18:26.723]  So Adam Schiff made this announcement after all of this has already been exposed.
[00:18:28.752 --> 00:18:33.295]  Chinese spies are trying to snoop on Zoom conversations, U.S.
[00:18:33.415 --> 00:18:34.516]  intel experts say.
[00:18:36.758 --> 00:18:40.401]  Zoom under fire for security vulnerabilities ties to China.
[00:18:41.642 --> 00:18:45.484]  Zoom CEO acknowledges security missteps in live streams.
[00:18:46.585 --> 00:18:52.570]  Zoom encryption not suited for secrets has surprising links to China, researchers discover.
[00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:56.911]  Zoom security fears prompt Taiwan government ban.
[00:18:57.011 --> 00:19:00.453]  So it's been banned in Taiwan, which China is trying to take over right now.
[00:19:01.454 --> 00:19:09.599]  Zoom is giving paid users more control over where their calls are routed after it got slammed for mistakenly using data centers in China.
[00:19:10.119 --> 00:19:14.862]  Now again, post all of that.
[00:19:16.053 --> 00:19:23.698]  Adam Schiff says the Intelligence Committee will be conducting Zoom hearings during the coronavirus pandemic.
[00:19:23.838 --> 00:19:27.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, Adam Schiff is openly trying to host U.S.
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:31.742]  intelligence classified meetings with China in the room.
[00:19:35.484 --> 00:19:43.692]  I'd like to get up here and start screaming and shouting and smashing things because this is open treason against this country by Adam Schiff, committed again.
[00:19:44.292 --> 00:19:46.674]  And he hasn't faced a single day in jail.
[00:19:47.035 --> 00:19:50.778]  He deserves to rot in jail, his corpse rotting.
[00:19:50.938 --> 00:19:52.099]  He doesn't deserve a funeral.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:53.421]  He doesn't deserve a burial.
[00:19:53.581 --> 00:19:54.562]  He doesn't deserve water.
[00:19:54.782 --> 00:19:55.763]  He doesn't deserve food.
[00:19:55.983 --> 00:19:58.986]  He deserves to sit in a cell and rot until he's dead!
[00:20:01.544 --> 00:20:06.785]  And here he is showing you his true colors, folks, because you see, Adam Schiff has nothing left to lose.
[00:20:07.125 --> 00:20:14.407]  He's already been exposed as an anti-American agent with the Russian collusion investigation, the total hoax that he knowingly went along with.
[00:20:14.807 --> 00:20:21.268]  His connections to Ed Buck and his little drug dungeon, drug sex dungeon, where people turn up dead.
[00:20:21.728 --> 00:20:23.529]  Adam Schiff has nothing left to lose.
[00:20:23.749 --> 00:20:26.249]  He's openly showing you he's an agent of China.
[00:20:26.489 --> 00:20:30.050]  He's openly trying to have meetings with China in the room.
[00:20:32.964 --> 00:20:33.604]  Let's move on.
[00:20:35.125 --> 00:20:38.647]  Now, we're going to go back in time, but it's very important to make these connections now.
[00:20:40.028 --> 00:20:44.711]  Remember, Chinese researcher tried to smuggle biological material out of U.S.
[00:20:44.931 --> 00:20:47.793]  That is Zhang Xiaosong back in December.
[00:20:48.689 --> 00:20:51.731]  Who is Zhao Song connected with?
[00:20:52.211 --> 00:20:57.534]  Harvard University professor and two Chinese nationals charged in three separate Chinese-related cases.
[00:20:57.574 --> 00:20:58.655]  That was in January.
[00:20:58.975 --> 00:21:10.762]  Dr. Charles Lieber of Harvard, who was working with China, working with Obama, and working with them, studying and testing with the COVID virus, the bat virus.
[00:21:11.703 --> 00:21:13.124]  He's been arrested.
[00:21:14.767 --> 00:21:20.569]  Even Snopes basically is admitting, was Charles Lieber arrested for selling COVID-19 coronavirus to China?
[00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:29.493]  Snopes' only defense is they're saying, yes, he was arrested, yes, he was transferring biological material, but we don't know that the COVID-19 came from a lab.
[00:21:29.933 --> 00:21:32.034]  Oh, came from a bat.
[00:21:33.775 --> 00:21:35.435]  But they already knew all this, folks.
[00:21:35.475 --> 00:21:39.597]  Remember Fauci in 2017 saying Trump will face a global pandemic?
[00:21:40.517 --> 00:21:41.878]  Well, the US State Department
[00:21:42.856 --> 00:21:48.980]  Warned of potential SARS-like pandemic after visiting Wuhan lab experimenting with bat coronavirus.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:51.582]  Now, let's continue down this line.
[00:21:51.602 --> 00:21:52.082]  So there you go.
[00:21:52.723 --> 00:21:57.206]  Harvard, Chinese agent transferring biological materials, already been arrested.
[00:21:58.506 --> 00:22:01.428]  But here's the Obama-Fauci deep state connection.
[00:22:02.869 --> 00:22:08.133]  Fauci's NIAID funded Wuhan lab scientists to research bat coronavirus.
[00:22:08.553 --> 00:22:09.614]  All the data is published.
[00:22:10.546 --> 00:22:18.028]  Here's even the statement and the data from the official NIH website from October 16, 2014 under Obama.
[00:22:18.368 --> 00:22:23.069]  Statement on funding pause on certain types of gain-of-function research.
[00:22:23.349 --> 00:22:26.450]  What did we have Dr. Francis Boyle talking about back in January?
[00:22:26.550 --> 00:22:30.331]  Gain-of-function in this bioweapon lab-made virus.
[00:22:31.897 --> 00:22:33.058]  And so that all happened.
[00:22:33.499 --> 00:22:33.739]  U.S.
[00:22:33.759 --> 00:22:38.623]  government gave 3.7 million grant to Wuhan lab that experimented on coronavirus source bats.
[00:22:38.663 --> 00:22:42.647]  And they can deny it, but it became a national story at the time, very controversial.
[00:22:42.667 --> 00:22:45.389]  That's why the NIH published this story.
[00:22:45.810 --> 00:22:47.591]  Here were some of the headlines at the time.
[00:22:48.032 --> 00:22:50.394]  Lab made coronavirus triggers debate.
[00:22:50.994 --> 00:22:54.116]  Engineered bat virus stirs debate over risky research.
[00:22:54.396 --> 00:23:03.100]  So you see the players, you see the game, you see the Chinese connection, you see the treason and the anti-American agenda right in front of your eyes.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.341]  It's all exposed.
[00:23:04.621 --> 00:23:05.582]  Will Trump act?
[00:23:06.222 --> 00:23:08.983]  Josh Hawley, Senator from Missouri, is ready to act.
[00:23:09.264 --> 00:23:10.264]  We are ready to act.
[00:23:10.404 --> 00:23:11.985]  But that's not all the Chinese connections.
[00:23:12.005 --> 00:23:13.206]  They're in the mainstream media too.
[00:23:13.266 --> 00:23:13.786]  That's next.
[00:23:14.626 --> 00:23:19.309]  Facing the greatest threat since our founding and the Civil War.
[00:23:20.509 --> 00:23:25.159]  The United States is now in a form of high-tech civil war.
[00:23:26.201 --> 00:23:29.849]  It's soft but being escalated and turned up now.
[00:23:31.169 --> 00:23:44.841]  This is a multinational corporate criminal takeover between the CHICOMs, the EU, the corrupt blue states, the cities, with major global corporations and big tech surveilling the population with AI control.
[00:23:45.542 --> 00:23:48.684]  This is a mass breaking of the American people's will.
[00:23:49.185 --> 00:23:51.167]  They want you to submit and roll over.
[00:23:51.727 --> 00:23:54.851]  If you roll over, it will only get worse.
[00:23:55.291 --> 00:23:58.194]  Mayday, mayday, mayday, mayday.
[00:23:58.535 --> 00:24:01.058]  This is a new world war.
[00:24:01.698 --> 00:24:04.442]  This is next-generational warfare.
[00:24:05.162 --> 00:24:09.447]  The criminals engaged in this believe you're weak and believe they can break your will.
[00:24:10.248 --> 00:24:13.351]  We can defeat them, but this is the main assault.
[00:24:13.831 --> 00:24:15.652]  President Trump is the target.
[00:24:16.193 --> 00:24:17.874]  President Trump is the target.
[00:24:18.575 --> 00:24:24.680]  Once he's removed, they are going to clamp down full martial law forever and release even more deadly viruses.
[00:24:25.734 --> 00:24:27.035]  This is the truth.
[00:24:27.775 --> 00:24:28.976]  This is the reality.
[00:24:29.496 --> 00:24:35.979]  And the credibility of Infowars reading globalist documents on air is so high, they are not going to allow us to be on air much longer.
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:40.262]  America must let Congress, the courts, and the state governors know.
[00:24:40.762 --> 00:24:49.607]  An alliance of the people, an alliance of the republic must be formed against the globalists that seek to end the republic and the nation's very existence.
[00:24:50.447 --> 00:24:56.550]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is my emergency message to the people of the world, the President, and the people of America.
[00:24:57.191 --> 00:25:00.553]  And those in the government must now choose which side they're on.
[00:25:01.273 --> 00:25:01.713]  It's here.
[00:25:02.153 --> 00:25:03.614]  Toe-to-toe with the New World Order.
[00:25:03.974 --> 00:25:05.135]  Toe-to-toe with the globalists.
[00:25:05.615 --> 00:25:19.323]  The United States is now under soft martial law, being carried out by the NIH, the World Health Organization, the United Nations, the Blue Cities, and Blue States.
[00:25:20.287 --> 00:25:29.893]  The alliance that's been announced by the West and East Coast against Trump and against the flyover country is a giant criminal power grab.
[00:25:30.851 --> 00:25:53.090]  They have full page articles in the New York Times saying Trump's crazy because he's questioned the NIH saying we need this giant lockdown when it turns out their projections were way overblown and that they themselves have been intimately involved in the level four bioweapons labs that transferred this very virus and systems to the communist Chinese.
[00:25:54.511 --> 00:25:56.753]  The globalists want total submission.
[00:25:58.533 --> 00:26:04.942]  And they are about to move against President Trump because he's trying to block the permanent shutdown and the depression.
[00:26:05.963 --> 00:26:08.226]  America is under economic siege.
[00:26:09.488 --> 00:26:12.612]  I can tell you that Fox News is now turning against President Trump.
[00:26:13.613 --> 00:26:23.043]  And different major talk show hosts on Fox News are so loyal to America and common sense are being threatened and not just threatened with their jobs.
[00:26:23.824 --> 00:26:25.766]  They're being threatened with more than that.
[00:26:26.566 --> 00:26:30.791]  The globalists are making their move to take down the country forever.
[00:26:32.312 --> 00:26:36.376]  They are devastating flyover country while keeping the mega corporations open.
[00:26:37.495 --> 00:26:40.161]  It is time to contact Governor Abbott.
[00:26:40.361 --> 00:26:47.397]  It is time to contact President Trump and other patriot governors, and they must form a public alliance against the shy comms.
[00:26:48.763 --> 00:26:55.808]  And against the globalists in Hollywood and the leftist governors who are enemies of the Republic, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:56.489 --> 00:27:02.573]  First, they denied there was a problem with the virus to lull Trump into a sense of complacency.
[00:27:03.334 --> 00:27:07.277]  Then they announced it was the end of the world and demanded he clamp total controls on.
[00:27:07.917 --> 00:27:10.179]  When he went along with that, they said, OK, you've done a good job.
[00:27:10.699 --> 00:27:15.462]  Now they're going to move into the phase of saying he's done a terrible job and needs to be removed from office.
[00:27:16.383 --> 00:27:18.343]  And they're going to then go after everybody.
[00:27:18.363 --> 00:27:22.324]  They're going to get your Second Amendment, your children, everything.
[00:27:23.004 --> 00:27:26.905]  And again, I'm not at liberty to tell you what's going on behind the scenes, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:27:26.985 --> 00:27:31.426]  But in the last few months, I've broken it down here that the globalists are pissed.
[00:27:31.486 --> 00:27:34.046]  And they're mad that all their fake lawsuits against us are failing.
[00:27:34.486 --> 00:27:36.326]  So they run fake news saying that they're winning.
[00:27:36.346 --> 00:27:36.727]  They're not.
[00:27:37.627 --> 00:27:40.067]  So now they're going to move into other realms.
[00:27:40.607 --> 00:27:41.347]  And that's OK.
[00:27:41.787 --> 00:27:44.348]  Because I've understood what the globalists are up to.
[00:27:45.327 --> 00:27:50.318]  I've understood their operations and I've known what I was getting into fighting these tyrants and monsters.
[00:27:50.899 --> 00:27:52.883]  So it's not about Alex Jones, it's about all of us.
[00:27:53.745 --> 00:27:54.867]  Here's my message to the President.
[00:27:56.343 --> 00:27:58.204]  Mr. President, your instincts are dead on.
[00:27:58.264 --> 00:28:04.488]  You've done a great job fighting these people, but you haven't had enough folks that had courage around you to carry out the restoration of the Republic.
[00:28:05.169 --> 00:28:06.589]  But you got the economy restarted.
[00:28:06.609 --> 00:28:11.512]  You showed the people that globalism was an artificial system meant to shut us down.
[00:28:12.333 --> 00:28:16.556]  So now they're involved in total economic warfare and siege against the Republic.
[00:28:17.156 --> 00:28:21.218]  And this country is facing its greatest threat since its founding in the Civil War.
[00:28:21.979 --> 00:28:23.240]  We are in the middle
[00:28:24.594 --> 00:28:37.670]  of a world war, an economic, cultural war, and they're using warfare and they're using seized areas of the Justice Department to carry out these operations.
[00:28:38.795 --> 00:28:50.322]  Just as I warned in the last few years, they would do that their next phase when Russiagate failed would be to use the Southern District of New York and the Feds to again go after the President.
[00:28:50.342 --> 00:28:51.783]  But these folks are not Feds.
[00:28:52.723 --> 00:28:58.027]  On the East Coast, places like Boston, the Feds protected Whitey Bulger, who carried out murders for them.
[00:28:58.848 --> 00:29:00.009]  It's the same thing in New York.
[00:29:00.969 --> 00:29:05.332]  And they want to project that tyranny they already have over those areas to the rest of the country.
[00:29:05.372 --> 00:29:19.082]  And so now, with allied criminals inside the federal government, allied criminals inside state governments, in blue city areas, in blue state areas, they are moving with their blockade against the Constitutional Republic.
[00:29:19.802 --> 00:29:23.505]  America rolling over to this will only get you enslaved and destroyed.
[00:29:25.011 --> 00:29:31.816]  President Trump, you must come out like you did, your instincts are right, last week and expose the WHO as being communist Chinese hell.
[00:29:32.637 --> 00:29:37.420]  You must expose Dianne Feinstein and the communist Chinese agents inside her Senate offices.
[00:29:37.941 --> 00:29:46.027]  You must hit them with everything you've got yourself now and expose that they are globalists working to destroy the country.
[00:29:46.607 --> 00:29:52.369]  You must devastate them with the truth now or they are going to trigger a hot civil war.
[00:29:52.869 --> 00:30:00.172]  This is their plan and they're trying to drive you from office hoping your cabinet is scared and being threatened behind the scenes and that they will stand down.
[00:30:00.192 --> 00:30:04.573]  I think your cabinet's smart enough to understand that you finally got some decent people in.
[00:30:04.893 --> 00:30:06.434]  They can't play both sides of this.
[00:30:07.174 --> 00:30:08.754]  They have to join with the Republican.
[00:30:08.794 --> 00:30:10.255]  They have to do the right thing and have courage.
[00:30:10.455 --> 00:30:11.115]  I have courage.
[00:30:11.655 --> 00:30:12.716]  Our listeners have courage.
[00:30:12.736 --> 00:30:15.597]  The American people have courage and they stand with you, President Trump.
[00:30:16.517 --> 00:30:18.439]  And I stand with you.
[00:30:19.339 --> 00:30:27.085]  No matter what they're doing to myself and my family behind the scenes, that of course obviously will soon be revealed to the world, I understand the cost.
[00:30:27.145 --> 00:30:30.808]  And I know what our forebears had to go through, what our veterans had to fight and die for.
[00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:34.851]  And so I've done the best job I could trying to mobilize the American people.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:44.023]  And they now are moving against me to ensure that I won't be there when they try to take you down in the next three to six months.
[00:30:44.823 --> 00:30:46.003]  This is the real coup.
[00:30:47.304 --> 00:30:50.585]  The global civil war being launched against America by the axis of evil.
[00:30:50.845 --> 00:30:57.727]  Communist China, the EU, Hollywood, and the blue states, the captured blue cities, are now throwing their full force against us.
[00:30:58.687 --> 00:30:59.848]  Everybody pray for America.
[00:30:59.968 --> 00:31:00.828]  Pray for President Trump.
[00:31:00.868 --> 00:31:01.868]  Pray for a global awakening.
[00:31:02.229 --> 00:31:03.069]  And pray for him full force.
[00:31:03.829 --> 00:31:25.781]  I'm Alex Jones, faithfully defending the Constitutional Republicans' enemies, foreign and domestic, faithfully trying to help people be prepared for what's happening, and I trust in God and put my providence in God, and I turn things over to God now and recommit my life, more than ever, that my life is in God's hands and I commit my destiny into God's hands and His Son, Jesus Christ.
[00:31:26.701 --> 00:31:27.862]  God bless and good luck.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:35.862]  So we've seen the connections, ladies and gentlemen, with the Democrat Party and Dianne Feinstein and her Chinese spy openly acting for China.
[00:31:35.882 --> 00:31:41.404]  We've seen it on social media where they censor American communications but promote Chinese propaganda.
[00:31:41.964 --> 00:31:43.825]  Now it's being exposed in the media.
[00:31:43.905 --> 00:31:51.907]  You see some of these media members during the press briefings heckling President Trump, trying to get under his skin, attacking him, making him look weak and bad.
[00:31:52.227 --> 00:31:53.108]  He wins every time.
[00:31:53.948 --> 00:32:00.029]  But he shows a video montage of all the fake news media back months ago saying, oh, don't worry about the coronavirus.
[00:32:00.069 --> 00:32:00.790]  Nothing to see here.
[00:32:00.890 --> 00:32:02.290]  Then they tell him, wow, it's your fault.
[00:32:02.330 --> 00:32:03.170]  Thousands died.
[00:32:03.950 --> 00:32:09.852]  But then Paula Reid, one of the news hags heckling President Trump, has been totally exposed.
[00:32:10.592 --> 00:32:14.013]  She is married to a Chinese government operative.
[00:32:14.918 --> 00:32:15.298]  Yes!
[00:32:16.019 --> 00:32:16.819]  Can you believe it?
[00:32:17.499 --> 00:32:25.704]  Paula Reid from CBS married to a known Chinese government operative and an agent of China.
[00:32:27.575 --> 00:32:28.837]  In DC.
[00:32:29.157 --> 00:32:35.243]  And you look at him, you look at her, and you say, yeah, I think we know why she married that guy and is now working in the White House.
[00:32:35.283 --> 00:32:38.347]  But the scary part is, the scariest part is this, folks.
[00:32:39.027 --> 00:32:44.613]  China takes advantage of USS Roosevelt being crippled by coronavirus and sends jets close to Taiwan.
[00:32:45.174 --> 00:32:46.916]  Wow, was that a strategic move?
[00:32:56.966 --> 00:33:01.152]  Ladies and gentlemen, fellow info warriors here in the United States and around the world, Alex Jones here.
[00:33:01.272 --> 00:33:08.362]  Owen Shorter is about to take over live and I should be in studio about 15 minutes into the second hour with the most critical information ever.
[00:33:08.382 --> 00:33:09.563]  The quickening is here.
[00:33:10.224 --> 00:33:12.387]  I'm overall proud of the work we've done the last 26 years.
[00:33:13.939 --> 00:33:17.062]  That I've made mistakes, but I've always done it from a good place in my heart.
[00:33:17.763 --> 00:33:20.186]  And I feel good and I'm right with God.
[00:33:21.187 --> 00:33:25.011]  I can tell you that the greatest threat this nation's ever faced is now upon us.
[00:33:25.031 --> 00:33:30.517]  I was thinking about it earlier, it's worse than our founding, more dangerous than that point, more dangerous than the Civil War.
[00:33:31.318 --> 00:33:31.618]  Because
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:36.804]  The two sides fighting each other were fighting over who would control western expansion.
[00:33:37.445 --> 00:33:40.328]  At least it was about the nation still existing in some form.
[00:33:41.029 --> 00:33:44.312]  The globalists are anti-human and absolutely committed to evil.
[00:33:44.933 --> 00:33:50.299]  And by increments they've domesticated Americans and gotten us to give up on our basic Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:33:51.790 --> 00:33:54.173]  And now the bottom has just absolutely fallen out.
[00:33:54.253 --> 00:34:04.562]  So now, like never before, tell everyone you know via word of mouth, via text message, via email, and however you can about this live show because I don't know how much longer we're going to be on the air.
[00:34:05.924 --> 00:34:07.645]  And again, I'm not even worried about InfoWars.
[00:34:08.286 --> 00:34:09.167]  I am worried about the crew.
[00:34:09.187 --> 00:34:10.408]  They're good people and you're the listeners.
[00:34:11.469 --> 00:34:13.471]  It's America and the world and our children.
[00:34:14.761 --> 00:34:22.786]  We should be worried about Bill Gates is on TV saying the vaccine they're coming out with is going to hurt at least 700,000 people.
[00:34:23.767 --> 00:34:26.108]  And there's going to be liability protection for the companies that do it.
[00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:32.713]  They're telling you up front that they're going to bring you a vaccine that's going to hurt and kill more people than the stupid virus.
[00:34:33.633 --> 00:34:42.140]  And that you can't leave your houses, and it's a scientific tyranny, and that the states are saying that they're organizing against Trump to block, ever turn the economy back on.
[00:34:42.180 --> 00:34:46.003]  We told you they were going to do that, because they're evil, and we know what they're going to do!
[00:34:46.023 --> 00:34:52.509]  And people couldn't believe that eight weeks ago, and I told you that was what was going to happen, because folks don't understand.
[00:34:52.569 --> 00:34:53.610]  The party's over.
[00:34:54.370 --> 00:34:56.592]  We didn't stand up for the Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[00:34:57.293 --> 00:34:58.414]  Now hell's being released.
[00:34:59.662 --> 00:35:06.103]  So, if you ever wanted to wear your InfoWars colors loud and proud into the future, get your t-shirts now.
[00:35:06.643 --> 00:35:07.523]  Get a piece of history.
[00:35:08.064 --> 00:35:19.566]  And if you want to get high quality supplements like X3, the real red pill, and our Winter Sun Vitamin D3 with K, and all of it, it's 50 to 60% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:35:20.286 --> 00:35:25.847]  And I just hope that you take action and help fund InfoWars into the future, because
[00:35:26.627 --> 00:35:30.089]  The globalists are moving against us and want to shut us down.
[00:35:30.169 --> 00:35:33.252]  And that means they're moving against Trump and the whole enchilada.
[00:35:34.152 --> 00:35:36.714]  And I would expect them to trigger more of their sleeper cells.
[00:35:37.254 --> 00:35:39.236]  Congressmen better, and women, better be safe.
[00:35:39.776 --> 00:35:43.679]  If they're members of the Liberty Caucus, Trump better be watching everything he does.
[00:35:43.699 --> 00:35:46.320]  The Secret Service better be watching his every move.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.382]  I know they are because, man, I'm telling you folks.
[00:35:49.042 --> 00:35:54.928]  If you knew what was going on behind the scenes, and I'm not allowed to tell you about, it would just absolutely set a chill up your spine.
[00:35:55.769 --> 00:35:58.392]  And they are threatening every major talk show host right now.
[00:35:59.273 --> 00:36:03.557]  And I got to say, I'm proud of people holding the line and not buckling to these terrorists.
[00:36:03.617 --> 00:36:08.883]  But the government is just full of yes men and women that will carry out any criminal order
[00:36:09.503 --> 00:36:10.104]  We're good to go.
[00:36:30.509 --> 00:36:36.994]  And once the depression fully hits, as I warned a month ago, I said within a month or so it would be too late, they're going to blame the President.
[00:36:37.935 --> 00:36:39.135]  And so, this is it.
[00:36:39.776 --> 00:36:44.519]  I just can't believe they had so much scum working with them and so much trash that was willing to do all this.
[00:36:44.599 --> 00:36:54.947]  But, you know, we killed 60 plus million babies in this country and we go along with China with their one child policy and we have pedophile story time for kids and we're just a damn evil country.
[00:36:55.588 --> 00:36:59.451]  A lot of good people left in it but they kind of hide out in the countryside, Lord knows I want to.
[00:37:00.849 --> 00:37:03.470]  And they just think going along and rolling over is how you get ahead.
[00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:06.710]  And really all that did was bring the wolves into our country and destroy us.
[00:37:06.770 --> 00:37:14.652]  But if you ever wanted to support InfoWars, if you ever wanted to get high quality products, if you ever wanted to keep us in the game, you need to get the products right now.
[00:37:14.872 --> 00:37:19.433]  And you need to vote, a vote of confidence for us to stay the course and get those products.
[00:37:19.473 --> 00:37:27.375]  Because that's not just great products for you, that's money to fund us into the future with some of the biggest obstacles yet that we've got to face.
[00:37:27.935 --> 00:37:28.595]  So pray for us.
[00:37:29.475 --> 00:37:31.136]  I'm not going to back down because I can't back down.
[00:37:31.176 --> 00:37:32.257]  There's nowhere to run from this.
[00:37:32.617 --> 00:37:34.559]  It's an anti-human, New World Order takeover.
[00:37:35.159 --> 00:37:36.460]  The AI takeover is here.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:37.681]  The robot takeover is here.
[00:37:37.721 --> 00:37:38.962]  The forced inoculation is here.
[00:37:39.482 --> 00:37:41.043]  Half the world is under house arrest.
[00:37:41.143 --> 00:37:44.265]  I mean, my God, ladies and gentlemen, we're all becoming prisoners.
[00:37:44.885 --> 00:37:46.086]  And it's a very, very sad thing.
[00:37:46.567 --> 00:37:49.549]  But it's good to know the good people and to meet all these great souls.
[00:37:50.369 --> 00:37:58.635]  The crew and people like Owen Schroyer and just all the rest of the folks because it just lets you know who the real men and women are in this world that love God and love justice.
[00:37:59.475 --> 00:38:14.598]  That's why they're telling you I'm the bad man, and why they're always salivating and talking about how evil I am, and why they want to, you know, tell you I'm the bad guy, because they want to intimidate everybody else that's good from standing up and saying, look what we did to Donald Trump, look what we did to Alex Jones, and you know what?
[00:38:15.078 --> 00:38:16.498]  We wouldn't have any freedom.
[00:38:17.018 --> 00:38:20.359]  We wouldn't stand on the shoulders of people who came before us if they hadn't done the right thing.
[00:38:21.059 --> 00:38:24.840]  And so I'm, quite frankly, feel good, feel close to God, and feel strong.
[00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:33.146]  And I know you feel strong as well, so let's pray, then let's take political action, and let's let the world know what's happening, and we're not going to back down to evil.
[00:38:33.786 --> 00:38:37.088]  It's always darkest before the dawn, folks, but we're a long way from the dawn right now.
[00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:38.930]  We're going to put our heads down and do the right thing.
[00:38:39.590 --> 00:38:41.212]  Back down with Schroyer and the ATX.
[00:38:41.292 --> 00:38:42.032]  I'll be in studio soon.
[00:38:43.373 --> 00:38:48.277]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's hit a couple more of these headlines before Alex Jones does join us again.
[00:38:48.377 --> 00:38:54.842]  Josh Hawley leading the way, leading the charge, sticking his neck out there to fight against the Chinese communists.
[00:38:55.725 --> 00:38:57.146]  We're trying to take America down.
[00:39:14.545 --> 00:39:18.391]  Senator from Missouri, it's time to put some more wind in his sails.
[00:39:18.452 --> 00:39:26.244]  But who is trying to take advantage of this and put a foreign substance into every human on the planet's bloodstream?
[00:39:26.284 --> 00:39:28.909]  Well, it's the Will and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:39:30.379 --> 00:39:40.171]  And Melinda Gates is now doing her media tour and she says, you'll see bodies in the streets of Africa, warns Melinda Gates, says vaccine is the ultimate solution to coronavirus.
[00:39:40.191 --> 00:39:48.761]  But wait a second, remember, it was the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that pushed Gardasil in Africa that ended up having dead bodies in the streets.
[00:39:49.702 --> 00:39:57.350]  And by the way, folks, you can go look at the Bill Gates and Melinda Gates and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's posts on YouTube and Instagram and social media.
[00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:03.696]  I mean, 98% negative, 98% of the people are saying, F you, leave us alone, get out of our lives.
[00:40:03.716 --> 00:40:05.257]  We don't want your poison vaccines.
[00:40:05.958 --> 00:40:08.180]  Across the media landscape, people are saying it now.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:11.023]  So people are catching on to Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:40:11.283 --> 00:40:12.825]  We don't want your dirty vaccines.
[00:40:13.045 --> 00:40:13.986]  We don't want your death.
[00:40:15.728 --> 00:40:17.569]  We know what you're pushing, Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:40:18.209 --> 00:40:19.770]  It's slavery and death!
[00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.251]  But you're too cowardly!
[00:40:22.291 --> 00:40:24.091]  You can't do it with the barrel of a gun!
[00:40:24.412 --> 00:40:32.335]  You gotta come after us with a secret little weapon, telling us you love us and it's good for us, and then you inject us with the most poisonous thing ever on this planet!
[00:40:35.596 --> 00:40:37.817]  But it's totally rejected, but they do it anyway.
[00:40:37.857 --> 00:40:40.218]  Not because they love you, because they hate you.
[00:40:41.499 --> 00:40:45.161]  Microsoft pulls ad featuring spirit cooker Marina Abramovich.
[00:40:45.621 --> 00:40:59.086]  Oh, the spirit cooker, the satanist, the big satanist Alistair Crowley devil was teaming up with Microsoft to do her next real life art project, which is just her and some digital simulation.
[00:40:59.106 --> 00:41:07.230]  You put the glasses over your head, just, you know, some new BS way of them cutting you off from going next level by giving you a fake next level projection.
[00:41:08.413 --> 00:41:09.474]  Of course it's Microsoft!
[00:41:09.794 --> 00:41:12.215]  Of course it's the devil worshipper Marina Abramovich!
[00:41:12.435 --> 00:41:13.876]  Of course it's totally rejected!
[00:41:15.357 --> 00:41:18.259]  So this is what is going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:19.219 --> 00:41:22.841]  And the United States is finally seeing it, calling it out.
[00:41:22.921 --> 00:41:27.324]  Roger Stone says Bill Gates may have created coronavirus to microchip people.
[00:41:27.784 --> 00:41:31.006]  Well, you can say that's a conspiracy theory, but that's what's happening.
[00:41:31.506 --> 00:41:35.708]  You can say it's wittingly or unwittingly, that is what's happening.
[00:41:35.748 --> 00:41:36.169]  And now,
[00:41:37.398 --> 00:41:41.940]  They're saying, well, Trump's thinking about reopening the country, so we have to tell him, no.
[00:41:42.741 --> 00:41:44.862]  So now they're telling us, we don't know when we can reopen.
[00:41:44.922 --> 00:41:47.123]  Maybe May, maybe next year, maybe never.
[00:41:47.783 --> 00:41:49.044]  Maybe never we can reopen.
[00:41:49.084 --> 00:41:50.185]  You just have to live like this.
[00:41:51.301 --> 00:41:54.723]  But governors in the White House are saying, no, we need to reopen.
[00:41:55.284 --> 00:41:57.845]  And Representative Massey has warned the U.S.
[00:41:57.925 --> 00:42:01.007]  weeks away from food shortages if we don't reopen.
[00:42:01.047 --> 00:42:02.328]  And he's 100% right.
[00:42:03.388 --> 00:42:06.490]  The supply lines will be dry, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:09.432]  We've been fortunate to this point.
[00:42:09.752 --> 00:42:11.894]  But I'm sick of the shutdown.
[00:42:12.791 --> 00:42:25.960]  I'm ready to fight it and so that's why I've officially now launched this Saturday at the Texas State Capitol in Austin, Texas, you can't close America rally at noon.
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:34.846]  At noon this Saturday for two hours on the Capitol steps, it's time for Americans to show up and say you cannot close America.
[00:42:35.106 --> 00:42:35.887]  Technically, the U.S.
[00:42:35.927 --> 00:42:37.348]  Capitol building is closed right now.
[00:42:38.089 --> 00:42:38.590]  So that's fine.
[00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:39.391]  They can lock the doors.
[00:42:39.631 --> 00:42:41.573]  They cannot tell us we can't be on the ground.
[00:42:41.593 --> 00:42:42.594]  This is public land.
[00:42:42.954 --> 00:42:43.976]  This is self-government.
[00:42:44.156 --> 00:42:45.037]  This is a republic.
[00:42:45.277 --> 00:42:46.658]  You cannot close America.
[00:42:46.859 --> 00:42:48.841]  You cannot tell us to shut down our business.
[00:42:49.001 --> 00:42:50.903]  You cannot tell us to shelter in place.
[00:42:51.103 --> 00:42:53.105]  You cannot tell us we need papers to travel.
[00:42:53.285 --> 00:42:55.488]  You cannot tell us we need a vaccine to travel.
[00:42:55.868 --> 00:42:58.529]  No, this is where we make our stand.
[00:42:58.749 --> 00:43:05.811]  And it's time for Americans to make their stand loud and clear so that the President can see that and act on that.
[00:43:07.071 --> 00:43:09.152]  And know that America has his back.
[00:43:09.532 --> 00:43:15.334]  This Saturday, noon, Texas Capitol Building in Austin, Texas.
[00:43:16.345 --> 00:43:18.487]  You can't close America Rally.
[00:43:18.928 --> 00:43:21.191]  I'm seeing these protests happening nationwide.
[00:43:21.251 --> 00:43:22.552]  It's time to make it go viral.
[00:43:22.812 --> 00:43:24.534]  Reopen the country, now!
[00:43:25.315 --> 00:43:30.421]  You, the so-called media, has been foaming at the mouth to get me further deplatformed so I can't respond to the lies.
[00:43:30.521 --> 00:43:31.642]  Think about this in America.
[00:43:32.143 --> 00:43:34.385]  Think about this in America, that I have been unable
[00:43:35.692 --> 00:43:49.732]  This is the 11th hearing that they've had in the last year and a half where I'm one of the main focuses and I have not ever been called to testify when they say outrageous, slanderous, defamatory things when they've had in the House Intelligence Committee, Senate Intelligence Committee, and others.
[00:43:49.973 --> 00:43:51.254]  They'll have people point blank.
[00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:55.797]  All I want to do is stay in this fight, and I see so many good men and women of every race, color, and creed who believe
[00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:26.474]  Made to where you don't realize your destiny and the spark of humanity you have and what it is you can do and your potential.
[00:44:27.095 --> 00:44:43.626]  Donnie was right that in each of us is a seed of the universe but you have to plant that seed, you have to water that seed, you have to commit to that and you have to not care what slaves of the system say to you when they try to intimidate you and try to laugh
[00:44:43.666 --> 00:44:54.432]  Should it ever appear that the inter-American doctrine of non-interference merely conceals or excuses a policy of non-action, if the nations of this hemisphere
[00:45:12.938 --> 00:45:17.461]  Those attempts to oppress you and control you and lie to you is the system failing.
[00:45:37.393 --> 00:45:38.754]  It knows we love each other.
[00:45:39.274 --> 00:45:40.475]  It knows we're coming together.
[00:45:40.995 --> 00:45:46.239]  It knows we have a fabulous world and things we can do that are so amazing.
[00:45:46.259 --> 00:45:48.060]  We've just begun to discover our power.
[00:45:49.221 --> 00:45:50.542]  And it doesn't want you to have that.
[00:45:50.602 --> 00:45:56.506]  It wants to steal that and capture your soul and use it because it's not creative.
[00:45:57.366 --> 00:46:01.569]  The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society.
[00:46:02.490 --> 00:46:05.952]  And we are as a people, inherently and historically,
[00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:09.413]  The spirit of the New World Order is not creative.
[00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:10.854]  It needs to capture you.
[00:46:33.010 --> 00:46:50.501]  And make you beg it and plead so that you can even be on its platform and show your creativity and then it sits in judgment like a satanic American idol and tells you how good you are because you've served it and you bow to it when it couldn't produce one original thought in the universe.
[00:46:51.441 --> 00:46:56.525]  Innovation and courage and the exercise of will
[00:46:57.521 --> 00:47:03.923]  And learning to be attacked and learning to not submit to that is what makes us grow.
[00:47:08.964 --> 00:47:23.007]  And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why this Saturday I've decided, announcing it today, we're going to be holding the You Can't Close America rally.
[00:47:24.218 --> 00:47:27.239]  At the Texas State Capitol in downtown Austin, Texas.
[00:47:27.259 --> 00:47:37.524]  It's time for citizens to stand up and take our country back, just like President Trump promised during his inaugural address.
[00:47:38.144 --> 00:47:42.346]  You can't close America Rally this Saturday at noon in Austin.
[00:47:43.226 --> 00:47:44.267]  We're into the second hour.
[00:47:44.407 --> 00:47:45.727]  Alex Jones is in the building.
[00:47:45.807 --> 00:47:52.370]  He could come crashing into his studio with breaking news any moment, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:47:56.121 --> 00:47:57.502]  I mean, I'll be perfectly honest with you.
[00:47:57.522 --> 00:48:02.564]  I got to all the desperate news that I wanted to get out and I said, look, I'm going to come on.
[00:48:02.664 --> 00:48:03.824]  I'm not going to rant and rave.
[00:48:03.844 --> 00:48:06.065]  I'm going to be focused and I'm going to hammer it out of the park.
[00:48:06.585 --> 00:48:07.846]  And we did that in the first hour.
[00:48:07.906 --> 00:48:08.906]  So I'm debating now.
[00:48:09.266 --> 00:48:10.847]  Should I open up the phone lines, guys?
[00:48:10.867 --> 00:48:13.648]  Do you think that's a safe bet to open up the phone lines as well?
[00:48:15.689 --> 00:48:22.832]  Yeah, let's do that, because I can sit here and be redundant, but we're going to put the report up in full at Band.Video and at Infowars.com.
[00:48:24.403 --> 00:48:26.310]  It's just so cut and dry it's ridiculous now.
[00:48:28.030 --> 00:48:31.191]  Academia colluding with China, with Harvard and Charles Lieber.
[00:48:31.891 --> 00:48:35.292]  Politicians colluding with China, with Dianne Feinstein and Adam Schiff.
[00:48:36.392 --> 00:48:44.214]  The Deep State colluding with China, with Obama and Fauci and their deal in 2014, which was scrutinized then and covered them.
[00:48:44.834 --> 00:48:46.734]  Dealing in bio-agents.
[00:48:47.674 --> 00:48:53.916]  Dealing in bio-material to China in that lab in Wuhan, specifically COVID viruses.
[00:48:54.236 --> 00:48:55.556]  It's all confirmed!
[00:48:56.929 --> 00:49:00.093]  And it's everything InfoWars first reported.
[00:49:02.736 --> 00:49:13.367]  So, if you want to call in and weigh in on this or weigh in on the idea that this Saturday I'm hosting the You Can't Close America rally at the Austin State Capitol.
[00:49:14.127 --> 00:49:18.431]  Which, I actually had people call into the War Room Show that I host, normally 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:49:18.451 --> 00:49:20.813]  Central, saying, hey, we should do it this Saturday.
[00:49:21.513 --> 00:49:26.477]  And after more further consideration and more research, I determined, yep, that's what we have to do.
[00:49:26.738 --> 00:49:27.518]  Now, here's the thing.
[00:49:28.659 --> 00:49:30.521]  People say, oh, aren't you worried about getting arrested?
[00:49:30.601 --> 00:49:32.723]  Or, you know, you're violating the law, you're gonna catch a virus.
[00:49:32.983 --> 00:49:33.263]  Uh, no.
[00:49:34.024 --> 00:49:34.664]  Zero fears.
[00:49:35.525 --> 00:49:36.666]  Not afraid of catching a virus.
[00:49:37.487 --> 00:49:38.748]  And I'm not afraid of getting arrested.
[00:49:39.368 --> 00:49:40.869]  And if they do want to arrest me, folks,
[00:49:41.837 --> 00:49:44.699]  Well, I think that just, again, exposes everything.
[00:49:44.880 --> 00:49:45.320]  Does it not?
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:49.403]  Are we in martial law right now because we're acting like it?
[00:49:51.305 --> 00:49:53.927]  Are we in martial law right now, or do I still have a First Amendment?
[00:49:56.089 --> 00:50:03.716]  Are we in martial law right now, instituted by the Chinese Communists and the Deep State, or am I still allowed
[00:50:05.216 --> 00:50:09.179]  To have free speech and redress my grievances with government.
[00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:10.921]  It's time to reopen the country, folks.
[00:50:11.722 --> 00:50:14.404]  And obviously, D.C.
[00:50:14.704 --> 00:50:21.390]  and the political hacks and the deep state and all the chi-coms in the media are not going to allow that narrative to come out.
[00:50:21.450 --> 00:50:22.611]  They want to stifle that.
[00:50:22.831 --> 00:50:27.235]  They want to put out fake propaganda on Twitter, pretending like everyone's dying.
[00:50:27.455 --> 00:50:31.300]  They want to tell you the hospitals are like war zones, but all we see is dance routine videos.
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:33.423]  It's all Chinese Communist propaganda.
[00:50:33.623 --> 00:50:39.751]  The Chi-Coms and the Deep State have colluded to crash the American economy in their latest attempt to get Trump out of office.
[00:50:39.951 --> 00:50:41.253]  What more do you need to know?
[00:50:43.530 --> 00:50:52.975]  And by the way, the perfect distraction as it all comes out, how Barack Obama committed treason and illegally spied on the Trump campaign.
[00:50:53.175 --> 00:51:07.822]  But right now as we speak, folks, the dirty Democrats and the Chinese communist agents and the deep state are working around the clock to scrub this turd that is Barack Obama.
[00:51:08.663 --> 00:51:12.945]  They're going to tell you, just get ready for the ultimate irony on this deal.
[00:51:14.172 --> 00:51:17.454]  Because again, it's undeniable that the Obama administration illegally spied on Trump.
[00:51:17.734 --> 00:51:21.477]  They've now admitted it, but they're getting ready to twist the narrative, folks.
[00:51:22.037 --> 00:51:27.621]  They may do it at the end of this week, like on a Friday, or they may just wait and do it next week, but they're going to twist it.
[00:51:27.641 --> 00:51:29.542]  They're going to say, oh, we were fooled by Russia.
[00:51:29.842 --> 00:51:30.442]  You watch!
[00:51:30.963 --> 00:51:34.245]  Because remember, the only Russian collusion was with Hillary Clinton.
[00:51:35.236 --> 00:51:38.037]  The only Russian collusion was with the Mueller investigation.
[00:51:38.057 --> 00:51:41.318]  They don't even have an investigation if it wasn't for Russian intelligence.
[00:51:41.578 --> 00:51:45.220]  So they're going to turn around and blame Russia and say, oh, Russia gave us bad intel.
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:48.861]  And they're going to think you're so stupid that you're actually going to believe that.
[00:51:49.824 --> 00:52:08.878]  They're going to assume that their media has enough power to sell you the bill of goods, that they unwittingly took bad information from Russia and then used that to illegally spy on Trump, with the backdrop of Russian collusion as the narrative, saying Trump did it, when they're admitting they did it, but they're saying, oh no, we can do it, we love America, not Trump.
[00:52:09.338 --> 00:52:10.579]  Which of course is baseless.
[00:52:11.279 --> 00:52:11.920]  On its face.
[00:52:12.700 --> 00:52:13.861]  On its surface value.
[00:52:16.383 --> 00:52:17.444]  And it's all
[00:52:18.513 --> 00:52:21.195]  Being ignored because of this coronavirus.
[00:52:22.455 --> 00:52:27.098]  Trump should be rounding up these people and arresting them yesterday.
[00:52:27.818 --> 00:52:34.822]  Every day Barack Obama and Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton are not arrested, every day this whole country is at stake.
[00:52:36.303 --> 00:52:44.648]  And until Clapper and Brennan and Comey and Obama and Clinton and Biden are brought in for questioning and arrested,
[00:52:46.061 --> 00:52:47.762]  Or even have a military tribunal.
[00:52:47.962 --> 00:52:48.582]  I don't care.
[00:52:48.882 --> 00:52:52.584]  Those treasonous dirtbags need to be on the stand.
[00:52:52.985 --> 00:52:54.045]  Not America!
[00:52:54.886 --> 00:52:56.486]  See, America's on the stand right now.
[00:52:56.807 --> 00:52:57.887]  Oh, you might have a virus.
[00:52:58.087 --> 00:52:59.048]  You can't leave your home.
[00:52:59.388 --> 00:53:00.488]  Oh, you might have a virus.
[00:53:00.749 --> 00:53:01.769]  You can't go shopping.
[00:53:02.149 --> 00:53:03.210]  Oh, you might have a virus.
[00:53:03.270 --> 00:53:04.190]  You have to wear a mask.
[00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:05.311]  You have to wear gloves.
[00:53:05.611 --> 00:53:06.572]  Oh, you might have a virus.
[00:53:06.772 --> 00:53:07.672]  Shut down everything.
[00:53:07.852 --> 00:53:08.913]  Shut down the economy.
[00:53:09.173 --> 00:53:10.614]  So now you're the enemy!
[00:53:11.474 --> 00:53:17.859]  Because you might have a virus that probably 80% of people either already have or still have in their microbiome.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.441]  And that's all coming out.
[00:53:20.501 --> 00:53:22.382]  They tested people in Chicago at a hospital.
[00:53:22.703 --> 00:53:25.965]  Most people didn't have coronavirus, but they had the antibodies for it.
[00:53:26.145 --> 00:53:27.506]  That means they recovered, folks.
[00:53:29.147 --> 00:53:35.953]  Same thing happened with, I'm not trying to be gross, but I think it was Seattle or somewhere, they literally tested human feces and they found the same thing.
[00:53:36.493 --> 00:53:38.835]  Most people have already had the coronavirus.
[00:53:40.322 --> 00:53:42.843]  And then you have Birx admitting it, and all the other people admitting it.
[00:53:43.083 --> 00:53:45.645]  If you die of anything, we just say coronavirus.
[00:53:45.845 --> 00:53:52.128]  You could get lugged into the hospital, a dead corpse, three shots to the chest, and they'd say, test him for coronavirus.
[00:53:52.648 --> 00:53:54.749]  And then they'd report it as a coronavirus death.
[00:53:57.338 --> 00:53:59.881]  You've seen the Chinese propaganda being promoted on Twitter.
[00:54:00.102 --> 00:54:03.526]  Fake Twitter accounts saying, my mammy died of coronavirus, this is serious.
[00:54:03.786 --> 00:54:06.069]  My pappy died of coronavirus, this is serious.
[00:54:06.329 --> 00:54:09.273]  Oh my gosh, I just had to pick up my dead kid because coronavirus.
[00:54:09.754 --> 00:54:10.295]  All fake!
[00:54:11.136 --> 00:54:12.637]  And Twitter allows this to happen.
[00:54:12.698 --> 00:54:13.018]  Why?
[00:54:13.298 --> 00:54:15.121]  Twitter is an anti-American agency.
[00:54:16.633 --> 00:54:17.914]  Folks, it's all been exposed.
[00:54:18.054 --> 00:54:19.675]  All the pieces have been put together, okay?
[00:54:20.175 --> 00:54:21.216]  What are we going to do about it?
[00:54:21.936 --> 00:54:23.697]  I can sit here and I can talk about Trump.
[00:54:24.117 --> 00:54:25.298]  I can ask Trump to do things.
[00:54:25.318 --> 00:54:26.519]  We can request Trump to do things.
[00:54:26.539 --> 00:54:27.659]  We can push Trump to do things.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:30.001]  Hell, we can sit here and scold Trump if he doesn't do them.
[00:54:30.221 --> 00:54:31.121]  And he probably deserves that.
[00:54:31.362 --> 00:54:34.043]  But if we don't take action, then what do we deserve?
[00:54:34.584 --> 00:54:36.905]  If we go along with all this, then what do we deserve?
[00:54:38.553 --> 00:54:49.501]  If we don't stand up for our rights and our freedoms and our civil liberties and our Bill of Rights and our Constitution and our right to self-government and our Republic, it's dead!
[00:54:49.941 --> 00:54:55.405]  And the Chinese Communists and their agents in the Deep State will come roll us up, just like they're doing.
[00:54:55.465 --> 00:54:57.366]  And let me, here's the one other thing, folks.
[00:54:58.347 --> 00:55:02.370]  And it's so bombshell, it's just like, you know, how do you even, how do people even comprehend it?
[00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.930]  They can't.
[00:55:03.951 --> 00:55:05.572]  You know, it's like finding out you have cancer.
[00:55:05.592 --> 00:55:06.933]  It's like, well, what can you do after that?
[00:55:08.456 --> 00:55:12.897]  Folks, all of this that we're seeing was already planned out years ago.
[00:55:14.118 --> 00:55:16.898]  That's why Obama sold China the Wuhan virus.
[00:55:18.239 --> 00:55:22.060]  That's why you had Chinese working with Harvard scientists to develop it.
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:24.461]  Okay, it was already going on.
[00:55:25.281 --> 00:55:26.041]  Here's the problem.
[00:55:26.601 --> 00:55:27.882]  They're rolling out their plan.
[00:55:27.942 --> 00:55:30.823]  Donald Trump has just been a roadblock for them.
[00:55:30.863 --> 00:55:32.183]  He's just been a speed bump for them.
[00:55:34.813 --> 00:55:39.599]  The biggest obstacle President Trump put in front of them was banning Huawei from the United States.
[00:55:42.002 --> 00:55:51.513]  Ladies and gentlemen, if Hillary Clinton would have won, Huawei would have been allowed in the U.S., they would have put their 5G technology everywhere, and we would have seen the same stuff here that we saw in Wuhan.
[00:55:52.455 --> 00:55:53.675]  You would have seen the seizures.
[00:55:53.695 --> 00:55:55.215]  You would have seen the coughing up of blood.
[00:55:55.235 --> 00:55:56.756]  You would have seen the collapsing in the streets.
[00:55:56.776 --> 00:55:58.416]  You would have seen the deadly outbreak.
[00:55:58.476 --> 00:55:58.816]  Why?
[00:55:59.076 --> 00:56:03.257]  Because the 5G radio waves are deadly.
[00:56:03.577 --> 00:56:08.098]  And it's a guarantee China has turned them into a weapon.
[00:56:08.378 --> 00:56:09.758]  A frequency weapon.
[00:56:09.958 --> 00:56:12.018]  And they tested it on their own people in Wuhan.
[00:56:12.239 --> 00:56:15.479]  That's why you only see the outbreak in Wuhan and nowhere else.
[00:56:16.039 --> 00:56:20.200]  That's why the Navy, which has now docked four Navy ships,
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:27.943]  And now the Chinese Navy is rolling back outside of Thailand, rolling back into the South China Sea.
[00:56:31.825 --> 00:56:37.127]  That's why the cruise ships that had the 5G technology on them had coronavirus outbreaks.
[00:56:37.367 --> 00:56:42.530]  That's why the 5G towers they put on children's schools so children develop cancer.
[00:56:44.668 --> 00:56:53.610]  If Hillary Clinton would have won, Huawei would have been allowed in the U.S., their 5G frequency weapon would have been blasting us, and all of the United States would have looked like Wuhan.
[00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:59.211]  Thank God President Trump is in the White House and not that demon Hillary Clinton.
[00:56:59.231 --> 00:57:01.031]  It would have been death for America, folks.
[00:57:02.172 --> 00:57:03.652]  And Trump has been a great speed block.
[00:57:04.492 --> 00:57:08.253]  But it's time for that speed block to turn into an absolute savage.
[00:57:09.284 --> 00:57:11.145]  Just like we saw in the press briefing yesterday.
[00:57:11.165 --> 00:57:12.786]  So phone lines coming up 877-789-2539.
[00:57:12.806 --> 00:57:12.846]  877-789-2539.
[00:57:12.886 --> 00:57:15.308]  How do we take America back?
[00:57:15.428 --> 00:57:24.754]  And I'm here to tell you I don't need you to thank me and tell me I've done a good job.
[00:57:24.854 --> 00:57:27.015]  I've done nothing but my duty!
[00:57:27.035 --> 00:57:31.678]  I discovered a bunch of bloodthirsty scum coming after innocent people!
[00:57:31.738 --> 00:57:33.680]  And I've been fighting them for 13 years!
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:36.501]  And I'll never stop while I'm drawing breath!
[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:45.463]  For 26 years, Alex Jones and Infowars have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide.
[00:57:46.203 --> 00:58:03.869]  Waking people up to the New World Order, Bohemian Grove, the American Deep State, the rise of Communist China, the plan for global depopulation, and global elite pedophiles who prey off of our young.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:10.904]  The enemy has done their best to destroy us, but because of your support, our fight continues.
[00:58:11.604 --> 00:58:12.045]  Join us.
[00:58:12.065 --> 00:58:16.688]  Support the InfoWars, and together, we will slay the dragon.
[00:58:16.908 --> 00:58:19.030]  Keep fighting Alex, you're the gladiator.
[00:58:19.050 --> 00:58:28.096]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, we're back live from the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas, where this Saturday, I am
[00:58:31.087 --> 00:58:34.209]  Hosting and attending the You Can't Close America rally.
[00:58:34.229 --> 00:58:43.214]  Now it was just sent to me, apparently there's already a rally planned for Thursday at noon at the Governor's Mansion, which is basically right next door to the state capitol.
[00:58:44.375 --> 00:58:45.936]  Obviously the capitol grounds are large.
[00:58:47.265 --> 00:58:53.491]  For all intents and purposes, it's just catty corner to the state capitol on the south side.
[00:58:54.372 --> 00:58:56.313]  So that's Thursday.
[00:58:56.353 --> 00:58:57.594]  Now, I didn't know anything about that.
[00:58:57.614 --> 00:59:00.717]  That was just sent to me, so may attend that as well.
[00:59:01.558 --> 00:59:03.780]  But Saturday, I want this to be the big one.
[00:59:03.820 --> 00:59:04.741]  I want people to show up.
[00:59:04.761 --> 00:59:05.802]  We're promoting it here today.
[00:59:05.842 --> 00:59:06.542]  We just decided.
[00:59:07.469 --> 00:59:14.695]  You can't close America Rally this Saturday noon at the Texas State Capitol.
[00:59:15.055 --> 00:59:17.557]  Are we under martial law or do we still have a First Amendment?
[00:59:18.498 --> 00:59:20.179]  Only one way to find out.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:26.003]  But I cannot emphasize this enough, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:59:27.404 --> 00:59:32.048]  This has been an exercise in tyranny and we've gone along with it.
[00:59:34.258 --> 00:59:35.039]  We've gone along with it.
[00:59:35.579 --> 00:59:37.220]  And they've put the gun to our head.
[00:59:37.841 --> 00:59:39.582]  Actually, they've put multiple guns to our head.
[00:59:39.982 --> 00:59:42.264]  They put the coronavirus gun to our head.
[00:59:42.644 --> 00:59:44.586]  Then they put the we'll find you gun to our head.
[00:59:44.866 --> 00:59:46.868]  Then they put the we'll arrest you gun to our head.
[00:59:48.649 --> 00:59:51.031]  So they're holding us hostage, folks, illegally.
[00:59:52.011 --> 00:59:53.673]  The government cannot tell you to shut down.
[00:59:54.093 --> 00:59:56.295]  The government can't shut down the private free market.
[00:59:56.335 --> 00:59:58.556]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:00:00.635 --> 01:00:04.278]  It's like, I can't believe people don't see this total tyranny rollout that we're dealing with.
[01:00:04.998 --> 01:00:08.881]  But before I end up babbling for the rest of the segment, I'm going to go to your calls here.
[01:00:08.921 --> 01:00:10.863]  Remember folks, InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:00:13.384 --> 01:00:13.985]  Here's the story.
[01:00:14.125 --> 01:00:18.008]  InfoWars is a rock in the flow of tyranny.
[01:00:18.588 --> 01:00:20.210]  We will not be moved.
[01:00:22.091 --> 01:00:25.954]  And the only way we can be ineffective is if we are removed.
[01:00:26.650 --> 01:00:33.285]  But as long as you support us at InfowarsStore.com, we cannot and will not be moved.
[01:00:33.425 --> 01:00:34.247]  We know our role.
[01:00:36.021 --> 01:00:39.584]  And the good news is, hey, we sell the best supplements at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:00:39.904 --> 01:00:41.225]  The enemy of America knows that.
[01:00:41.245 --> 01:00:42.666]  That's why they go after our store.
[01:00:42.706 --> 01:00:43.947]  They don't want you to be healthy.
[01:00:43.987 --> 01:00:49.612]  They don't want you to see the powerful documents, documentaries at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:00:49.632 --> 01:00:53.275]  They don't want you to have access to the powerful supplements at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:00:53.295 --> 01:00:58.979]  They don't want you to have access to the air filters, to the water filters, to the emergency food supplies.
[01:00:59.219 --> 01:01:00.920]  They're going after your health, folks.
[01:01:01.701 --> 01:01:03.103]  We knew this a long time ago.
[01:01:03.143 --> 01:01:05.386]  That's why we created Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:01:05.906 --> 01:01:08.930]  With all the vitamins and minerals to start your day off.
[01:01:08.950 --> 01:01:10.211]  That's how I drink it every morning.
[01:01:10.652 --> 01:01:11.253]  Start my day.
[01:01:12.536 --> 01:01:15.500]  50% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:19.043]  We said, hey, in the winter you're not getting much vitamin D from the sun.
[01:01:19.183 --> 01:01:20.905]  Vitamin D is good for your immune system.
[01:01:21.526 --> 01:01:24.729]  Let's have winter sun plus vitamin D supplement.
[01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:28.733]  50% off at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:01:28.773 --> 01:01:34.580]  And then the elite of the supplements, the DNA Force Plus, look up telomeres and what

[01:01:39.268 --> 01:01:40.549]  Read all the reviews for yourself.
[01:01:40.569 --> 01:01:42.791]  DNA Force Plus also 50% off.
[01:01:42.811 --> 01:01:44.253]  But hey, we got household items too.
[01:01:44.933 --> 01:01:46.114]  I drink the coffee.
[01:01:46.154 --> 01:01:47.135]  It's my favorite coffee.
[01:01:47.596 --> 01:01:52.120]  The Wake Up America Patriot Blend Coffee from InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:54.122]  I'm on my second cup so far today.
[01:01:54.182 --> 01:01:55.983]  I think I'll probably have a third.
[01:01:56.424 --> 01:01:57.625]  That's how much I enjoy it.
[01:01:58.325 --> 01:01:59.346]  Goes great with a donut.
[01:01:59.506 --> 01:02:01.688]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:02.089]  Okay.
[01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:08.232]  Let's go out to the phone lines now and start with Carlos in Canada.
[01:02:08.272 --> 01:02:10.413]  We start in the Great North today.
[01:02:10.493 --> 01:02:11.513]  Go ahead, Carlos.
[01:02:11.533 --> 01:02:13.414]  Hi, thank you very much.
[01:02:13.994 --> 01:02:22.037]  I just want to bring up a couple of items to the discussion, which are not really prominent at this stage.
[01:02:22.117 --> 01:02:29.780]  Of course, I understand that the economy must be restored, but the issue of the economy, depending on the biological invasion of a virus,
[01:02:30.578 --> 01:02:34.579]  Has to be tampered by the reality that we're trying to place blame.
[01:02:34.899 --> 01:02:42.960]  Now, the Chinese have admitted that they were, in fact, mandated from the United States itself to go ahead and research the coronavirus.
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:49.721]  Coronavirus issue was relating to whether it was transmissible from animals to humans.
[01:02:50.702 --> 01:02:54.742]  It happened to be so that they discovered that it was, and there was a release.
[01:02:55.422 --> 01:02:58.483]  And now, once it was released to the human population,
[01:02:58.962 --> 01:03:00.762]  And it was human-to-human transmission.
[01:03:01.102 --> 01:03:04.263]  I think the Chinese government tried to cover that up and they got themselves into trouble.
[01:03:04.303 --> 01:03:05.463]  So here's my problem.
[01:03:05.623 --> 01:03:09.204]  I'm not with what you're saying, Carlos, because I don't disagree with you.
[01:03:09.764 --> 01:03:10.705]  My problem is this.
[01:03:12.865 --> 01:03:26.688]  Knowing what we know, if the president knows that this is essentially a bio-release, call it a bio-weapon or whatever you want, but if this was originated and developed in a Chinese lab and then intentionally released,
[01:03:27.699 --> 01:03:30.482]  Or even if there's a 50% chance of that, which it's beyond that.
[01:03:30.522 --> 01:03:33.584]  That's 99.9% what we know happened.
[01:03:34.545 --> 01:03:36.947]  I think it's time for the president to be honest about this.
[01:03:37.007 --> 01:03:42.412]  Because that's the only way you can say, hey look, we need to do this.
[01:03:42.472 --> 01:03:44.093]  China just released a bioweapon.
[01:03:44.354 --> 01:03:46.095]  The Obama administration sold it to them.
[01:03:46.736 --> 01:03:47.897]  These are the enemies of America.
[01:03:47.917 --> 01:03:48.878]  We're going to have to deal with this.
[01:03:49.318 --> 01:03:58.301]  But because they don't give us the full rollout and they treat us like toddlers, we're left here drooling all over ourselves in a little enclosure.
[01:03:58.321 --> 01:03:58.301]  100%.
[01:04:01.443 --> 01:04:02.643]  I think you're 100% correct.
[01:04:02.943 --> 01:04:05.484]  However, I think it was out of sheer desperation.
[01:04:06.024 --> 01:04:13.427]  The timing being that the president was going to be re-elected and they really were in a position where as a political party, they were in real, real trouble.
[01:04:13.843 --> 01:04:17.446]  So I think, yeah, I think the timing is absolutely something that should be investigated.
[01:04:17.746 --> 01:04:34.900]  But there's another element which is not mentioned in the literature, is not mentioned externally, and that is that there is a company in that same Wuhan area, in the same almost industrial park, called WXI, Wuxi Pharmatech Cayman Inc.
[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.261]  Yeah, the Soros Pharmatech.
[01:04:36.942 --> 01:04:38.283]  Yeah, incorporated.
[01:04:38.463 --> 01:04:41.045]  At 666 whatever Geograph Avenue or whatever?
[01:04:41.946 --> 01:04:42.326]  That's right.
[01:04:42.853 --> 01:04:45.235]  Incorporated by George Soros.
[01:04:46.035 --> 01:05:00.264]  And an agreement was made between Wuxi and a company also owned largely by George Soros called Gilead, which was initially responsible for Tamiflu, the vaccine against H1N1.
[01:05:00.764 --> 01:05:09.470]  So we have to be very, very careful when we throw aspersions that in fact, I think the warning shot sent by the Chinese was
[01:05:10.111 --> 01:05:10.852]  Wait a second.
[01:05:10.932 --> 01:05:28.828]  Yes, we admit that we were doing this research in the Virology Institute of Wuhan, but careful, because if they really want to investigate and show where it came from, why it was released, and who released it, if it was deliberate, as a bioweapon, the Chinese have no interest in killing Iranians.
[01:05:29.266 --> 01:05:31.811]  The Chinese have no interest in contaminating Russians.
[01:05:32.211 --> 01:05:41.868]  The Chinese have no interest in having a world war with America any more than Cuba had interest in having a world war with America during the crisis.
[01:05:43.094 --> 01:05:50.421]  And you know, I'm so glad you said that before we hit break because that's the other outlier here that is tough to comprehend, but it's the situation we're in.
[01:05:50.461 --> 01:05:56.726]  Folks, the globalists were going to start World War III with China, the United States versus China, but it was going to be another fake war.
[01:05:57.366 --> 01:06:02.851]  Not like a real war that's good for the Chinese people to free them and good for the American people to get a fair trade deal.
[01:06:03.111 --> 01:06:06.995]  It would've been a fake war to bring in global tyranny and population control.
[01:06:07.695 --> 01:06:09.136]  But thank God Trump instead of Hillary.
[01:06:09.156 --> 01:06:10.798]  Alright, the phone lines are lit up.
[01:06:12.824 --> 01:06:26.532]  We're going to focus on the phone lines today, but another example of how it's failing, this deep state Chinese Communist shutdown of America that we're all falling for, thanks to our enemies in the media.
[01:06:28.587 --> 01:06:35.471]  Bill Gates has almost 0% support for his forced vaccinations worldwide.
[01:06:35.531 --> 01:06:42.196]  He posts on social media and 95% of the comments are anti-Bill Gates, anti-forced vaccinations.
[01:06:42.496 --> 01:06:43.216]  Incredible.
[01:06:43.556 --> 01:06:44.397]  Why is that?
[01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:47.659]  I'm gonna calm down before I start cursing.
[01:06:48.259 --> 01:06:52.202]  But seriously, like what kind of jerk-off, what kind of a-hole,
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:58.845]  When nobody wants you, nobody wants your products, nobody wants your poison, and yet you still want to shove it down our throats?
[01:06:59.626 --> 01:07:01.347]  That's a tyrant, folks.
[01:07:01.728 --> 01:07:03.849]  That's an evil, evil man right there.
[01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:06.071]  Leave us alone, Bill Gates.
[01:07:06.612 --> 01:07:07.753]  Leave us alone.
[01:07:08.794 --> 01:07:10.015]  But he just can't do it, can he?
[01:07:10.035 --> 01:07:12.637]  Because he wants that population control.
[01:07:13.017 --> 01:07:16.641]  He wants that access right into your human genome.
[01:07:18.522 --> 01:07:19.163]  I'm getting mad.
[01:07:20.916 --> 01:07:23.217]  But again, the good news is everyone's rejecting him.
[01:07:23.938 --> 01:07:28.060]  And now you have petition to recall Michigan governor passes 150,000 signatures.
[01:07:28.281 --> 01:07:34.144]  Yeah, people almost died because that bitch made it so you couldn't get hydroxychloroquine.
[01:07:35.685 --> 01:07:41.909]  By the way, her fellow Democrats went on air saying, yeah, the Michigan governor almost cost me my life.
[01:07:43.310 --> 01:07:44.891]  Do you know who we're dealing with, folks?
[01:07:44.971 --> 01:07:46.912]  This is war!
[01:07:49.830 --> 01:07:52.931]  Folks, they're all acting like it's war because the war is on.
[01:07:52.971 --> 01:07:55.451]  They all know the war to get America dead is on.
[01:07:56.092 --> 01:08:06.614]  The Chinese Communists, the Deep State, the Adam Schiff's, the media, Twitter, all these people are in war mode coming after you and your family and your freedoms.
[01:08:07.814 --> 01:08:09.555]  It's time for us to get into war mode.
[01:08:10.215 --> 01:08:11.395]  I'm not calling for violence.
[01:08:12.275 --> 01:08:14.356]  And this Saturday's protest is peaceful.
[01:08:16.348 --> 01:08:27.433]  But if we don't start behaving like there are acts of war coming at us every single day in this country and against the president every single day in this country, we will lose.
[01:08:29.333 --> 01:08:37.577]  It's like if you're playing basketball and the tip-off happens and the other team's playing for 10 minutes and then you look up and you're losing and you're like, huh?
[01:08:37.797 --> 01:08:39.617]  Are we playing a basketball game here?
[01:08:39.638 --> 01:08:42.599]  It's like, yeah, tip-off happened 10 minutes ago.
[01:08:42.699 --> 01:08:43.099]  Wake up!
[01:08:47.184 --> 01:08:48.304]  Let's go out to the phone lines.
[01:08:49.906 --> 01:08:51.246]  Judy in Florida.
[01:08:51.427 --> 01:08:52.527]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:52.567 --> 01:08:52.968]  Go ahead.
[01:08:54.649 --> 01:08:56.750]  Hey, thank you for taking my call.
[01:08:57.551 --> 01:09:03.695]  I received some information last night which gives a different slant on everything.
[01:09:05.997 --> 01:09:13.022]  When Trump signed the emergency provision, this
[01:09:15.638 --> 01:09:17.339]  Is this the report from Richie in Boston?
[01:09:17.379 --> 01:09:17.539]  Yes.
[01:09:38.336 --> 01:09:39.618]  Yeah, I've been following his reports.
[01:09:39.638 --> 01:09:40.919]  A lot of bombshell stuff.
[01:09:40.959 --> 01:09:45.184]  He's getting bombarded with censorship so you know there's reality to it.
[01:09:46.806 --> 01:09:48.368]  And he's reporting real stuff.
[01:09:48.388 --> 01:09:49.510]  Here's the thing to understand though.
[01:09:50.938 --> 01:09:54.802]  Most of the stuff that he's reporting on has already been going on for decades.
[01:09:55.442 --> 01:09:58.625]  And so all these powers have already been signed over to FEMA.
[01:09:59.325 --> 01:10:03.909]  And so what people are discovering now with Richie in Boston is how this is all happening.
[01:10:03.949 --> 01:10:10.595]  So people are kind of in this panic mode like seeing how FEMA has basically usurped all authority in the United States and they're panicking.
[01:10:10.995 --> 01:10:17.761]  Most of that's already happened already and now Trump is kind of realizing it and trying to figure out how to leverage that or what to do about it.
[01:10:18.783 --> 01:10:21.344]  Well, the state of emergency has been signed recently.
[01:10:21.825 --> 01:10:22.905]  He's met with FEMA.
[01:10:23.085 --> 01:10:24.526]  He's on camera with them.
[01:10:25.126 --> 01:10:32.951]  And he's talking about how you have to look at the verbiage, what he said for himself, that basically the old rules do not apply right now.
[01:10:33.751 --> 01:10:36.192]  And that we're in a new phase of action.
[01:10:36.673 --> 01:10:38.554]  I mean, what he says is kind of ominous.
[01:10:38.834 --> 01:10:39.614]  I'm not panicked.
[01:10:39.854 --> 01:10:43.837]  I'm looking at the fact that, you know, that's why Fauci's not gone now.
[01:10:44.237 --> 01:10:46.598]  But so here's the question that you have to be asking yourself.
[01:10:46.818 --> 01:10:48.219]  Do you support Trump?
[01:10:49.679 --> 01:10:50.980]  I support the United States.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:53.161]  I support the Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[01:10:53.201 --> 01:10:54.061]  No, I understand that.
[01:10:54.081 --> 01:10:54.981]  We're on the same page.
[01:10:55.462 --> 01:10:58.703]  But that's why I'm saying, look, President Trump will decide his own destiny.
[01:10:58.743 --> 01:11:05.666]  The name Trump will either live in gold letters throughout American history, or he'll be known as the greatest traitor to this country.
[01:11:06.067 --> 01:11:06.667]  That's on him.
[01:11:07.087 --> 01:11:08.588]  Americans have to decide our fate.
[01:11:08.888 --> 01:11:12.750]  Just like Trump has to decide his fate, Americans have to decide our fate.
[01:11:13.570 --> 01:11:18.893]  I would say that the president is, I mean, he's in the swamp, he's knee deep, he's dealing with these people.
[01:11:19.273 --> 01:11:24.195]  Maybe he thinks he can leverage these powers in FEMA to his advantage to help America.
[01:11:24.595 --> 01:11:26.556]  Maybe he doesn't realize how drastic it is.
[01:11:29.477 --> 01:11:38.482]  I would much rather have Trump in power than anybody else inside FEMA or anybody else saying that we need to give the states authority.
[01:11:38.722 --> 01:11:39.902]  First of all, the states don't have authority.
[01:11:39.942 --> 01:11:41.163]  The federal government doesn't have authority.
[01:11:41.323 --> 01:11:42.544]  Only we the people have authority.
[01:11:43.624 --> 01:11:44.345]  Anything else, Judy?
[01:11:46.045 --> 01:11:47.706]  FEMA is for an emergency.
[01:11:48.266 --> 01:11:51.188]  It's an emergency conglomerate.
[01:11:51.867 --> 01:11:59.589]  And from what I understand, and needs to be researched and brought out on InfoWars for itself, they are now over the presidency.
[01:11:59.849 --> 01:12:01.870]  As in, over the presidency.
[01:12:02.770 --> 01:12:12.572]  So, I mean, you know, whether Trump did it unwittingly, or he was given bad information about this, this whole outbreak, because I know it's bogus, you know it's bogus, but we're living in it.
[01:12:13.412 --> 01:12:14.513]  FEMA has control.
[01:12:14.993 --> 01:12:16.553]  That's what I'm trying to say, Owen.
[01:12:16.953 --> 01:12:19.294]  With all love and respect for you and InfoWars.
[01:12:19.838 --> 01:12:23.121]  Well, hold on, I'm not denying that, but I'm saying, who in FEMA?
[01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:24.442]  Who is Trump meeting with?
[01:12:24.542 --> 01:12:25.723]  Where do you see FEMA?
[01:12:26.263 --> 01:12:28.705]  And how is FEMA impacting your life today?
[01:12:30.466 --> 01:12:31.807]  Well, we can take a look around us.
[01:12:32.408 --> 01:12:38.493]  Number one, and let me say this, three 5G towers, I'm assuming they're 5G because they're brand spanking new.
[01:12:38.773 --> 01:12:42.616]  They're less than a mile from my house, and they're within a quarter mile of each other.
[01:12:42.796 --> 01:12:47.640]  They are standing out less than a mile away from where I live, okay?
[01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:48.881]  So, I don't know.
[01:12:49.528 --> 01:12:57.955]  And I know about the hardware movements, all of the big trucks, the troop trucks, all this stuff being dispersed around the United States.
[01:12:58.655 --> 01:13:02.878]  If you get down to brass tacks, we don't know what's going on because we're in lockdown.
[01:13:03.639 --> 01:13:13.046]  But I'm saying what Richie in Boston and what other people are putting forth while we still have information access as to what's happening within our borders.
[01:13:13.687 --> 01:13:16.689]  Everybody's been infiltrated in here also.
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.002]  I mean, I'm not saying this in panic.
[01:13:19.302 --> 01:13:21.644]  I'm looking at reality and saying, whoa!
[01:13:21.665 --> 01:13:25.208]  I mean, this is my country, too.
[01:13:27.551 --> 01:13:29.193]  Well, I'm not disagreeing with you.
[01:13:29.973 --> 01:13:31.295]  What do you think the solution is?
[01:13:35.119 --> 01:13:38.443]  I think the people that had the levers of power missed their chance.
[01:13:41.476 --> 01:13:45.419]  Well, the only person I trust with any leverage of power right now is Donald Trump.
[01:13:46.039 --> 01:13:58.849]  I mean, we've got great senators like Howley and Paul and Jim Jordan and all these things, but the lack of action on their behalf when it comes to the deep state corruption is not something I'm excited about.
[01:14:01.070 --> 01:14:03.172]  Trump is the one to take the lead role in this.
[01:14:03.792 --> 01:14:06.234]  And so again, I say, well, what is our solution to this?
[01:14:06.274 --> 01:14:07.835]  Yeah, FEMA's usurped power.
[01:14:08.155 --> 01:14:11.077]  Yeah, the deep state Chinese communists have shut down America.
[01:14:11.317 --> 01:14:13.019]  So again, my question remains the same.
[01:14:13.079 --> 01:14:14.400]  What do you think the solution is, Judy?
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:18.443]  I'm hosting a protest this weekend saying you can't close America.
[01:14:18.463 --> 01:14:22.606]  I'm on air every day exposing this, exposing the Chai Com connections, exposing the treason.
[01:14:22.626 --> 01:14:24.427]  I mean, what do you think you should do?
[01:14:25.986 --> 01:14:31.028]  There are people that are going to be doing the exact same thing in small pockets, and the pockets are going to grow.
[01:14:31.509 --> 01:14:37.792]  What happens later on is very questionable because we have armaments that are being shipped around the country.
[01:14:37.972 --> 01:14:41.733]  I'm not saying not to just relinquish freedom, okay?
[01:14:42.394 --> 01:14:48.236]  But I have a son that's brainwashed, and I don't know what condition my daughter's in in the state of Virginia, okay?
[01:14:48.436 --> 01:14:51.558]  She's supposedly in lockdown until June 10th, which is so
[01:14:52.788 --> 01:14:53.949]  And again, that's just illegal.
[01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:54.729]  That's just illegal.
[01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:57.992]  But Judy, let me ask you a question for perspective real quick.
[01:14:58.032 --> 01:15:00.453]  How long have you been listening or following InfoWars?
[01:15:01.674 --> 01:15:03.015]  Oh my gosh.
[01:15:06.658 --> 01:15:07.038]  I don't know.
[01:15:07.058 --> 01:15:10.500]  It's closing in on 16 years, 17 years.
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:11.761]  But that's my point.
[01:15:12.262 --> 01:15:13.823]  We've known about this.
[01:15:13.863 --> 01:15:15.904]  We've known about FEMA usurping power.
[01:15:15.924 --> 01:15:17.265]  We've known about all this corruption.
[01:15:17.285 --> 01:15:18.126]  No, no, no.
[01:15:18.246 --> 01:15:18.566]  I didn't.
[01:15:19.621 --> 01:15:22.923]  The emergency provision that was just signed was just signed.
[01:15:23.683 --> 01:15:31.107]  And from what I understand, that's when he gave away the authority of the presidency, whether he did it wittingly or not.
[01:15:31.687 --> 01:15:41.072]  Well, it's interesting because he's now saying in these press conferences, powerful call, Judy, thank you, Trump is now saying in these press conferences, I have total power, I have ultimate power.
[01:15:41.652 --> 01:15:47.795]  Is that him maybe kind of realizing he signed a bad deal with FEMA and he's now trying to just claim it by bully pulpit?
[01:15:49.229 --> 01:15:55.571]  Look, Judy's response to the news and information is organic and legit.
[01:15:58.712 --> 01:16:02.434]  And the frustration that we have is, it's a good frustration though.
[01:16:03.328 --> 01:16:05.470]  That so many people are waking up to all this.
[01:16:05.530 --> 01:16:16.498]  I'm not talking about Judy specifically, but so many people are waking up and seeing all this during this coronavirus pandemic and they're opening their eyes and they're saying, holy smokes, this is not the country I thought it was.
[01:16:16.678 --> 01:16:18.399]  This is not the media I thought it was.
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:20.501]  This is not the government I thought it was.
[01:16:23.183 --> 01:16:27.046]  And so for us, it's like, hey, this has been the case for decades.
[01:16:28.339 --> 01:16:30.260]  But it's good that people are fired up.
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:32.861]  It's good that they have that fire and fury and passion.
[01:16:33.501 --> 01:16:35.142]  That's how we're going to take this country back.
[01:16:35.582 --> 01:16:45.587]  See, the globalists and the Chinese and the deep state have culled us into this trance state where it's like we're not even alive anymore.
[01:16:46.687 --> 01:16:48.768]  That's how we've gotten to this point, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:48.808 --> 01:16:50.369]  Now, she was also talking about
[01:16:52.315 --> 01:16:54.897]  She was also talking about 5G towers in Florida.
[01:16:54.917 --> 01:17:04.463]  And by the way, this is just an Alex Jones documentary with all the InfoWars articles highlighting the FEMA usurpation of our country and everything just from decades ago, folks.
[01:17:06.204 --> 01:17:08.185]  But she was talking about 5G towers in Florida.
[01:17:08.245 --> 01:17:10.447]  Greg has called in from Florida, wants to talk about that as too.
[01:17:10.507 --> 01:17:11.368]  Go ahead, Greg.
[01:17:13.529 --> 01:17:13.829]  Hello.
[01:17:14.770 --> 01:17:15.070]  Hello.
[01:17:18.392 --> 01:17:18.692]  Hello.
[01:17:19.353 --> 01:17:19.593]  Hello.
[01:17:22.458 --> 01:17:23.299]  Yes, this is Greg.
[01:17:24.300 --> 01:17:25.161]  You're on the air.
[01:17:25.781 --> 01:17:26.862]  Hey, how you doing, Warren?
[01:17:26.902 --> 01:17:27.222]  Sorry.
[01:17:28.704 --> 01:17:34.289]  Yeah, a couple weeks ago, I just want to touch on a couple things with you, Owen, and you're doing a great job out there.
[01:17:35.170 --> 01:17:36.991]  I love your intensity, your fire.
[01:17:37.852 --> 01:17:44.278]  A couple weeks ago, and I didn't see it anywhere in the media, 3,760 vehicles burst into flames out near
[01:17:49.738 --> 01:17:53.281]  It was all the rental cars, new rental cars at Fort Myers Airport.
[01:17:55.283 --> 01:17:56.444]  I did not see that.
[01:17:56.864 --> 01:17:58.365]  Guys, let's see if we can find that story.
[01:17:59.046 --> 01:18:14.578]  Yeah, News-Press.com was carrying it and I saw that the weather station said that five cars caught on fire and they said that it was Florida's driest season of the year.
[01:18:14.618 --> 01:18:15.699]  Well, that's nonsense.
[01:18:16.221 --> 01:18:28.345]  Because if you look at all the videos that were taken from people, these things burst into flames, they were surrounded by trees, all these rental cars, and not one tree got burned.
[01:18:28.365 --> 01:18:30.706]  And you're saying it was a brush fire?
[01:18:30.746 --> 01:18:32.607]  I've never seen a brush fire ignite cars.
[01:18:33.327 --> 01:18:34.787]  It was not a brush fire, it was not.
[01:18:34.847 --> 01:18:39.129]  What it was, what I believe it was, I'm in the car business for 31 years.
[01:18:40.629 --> 01:18:44.791]  What I believe it was, was the 5G technology that they have in these cars now.
[01:18:45.937 --> 01:18:49.278]  And I understand they're ramping this stuff up at the airports.
[01:18:50.398 --> 01:18:52.439]  But yeah, you want to check into that.
[01:18:53.539 --> 01:18:55.720]  It was two weeks ago on a Friday.
[01:18:56.100 --> 01:18:58.201]  Yeah, we've got the stories and the videos and everything up.
[01:18:58.281 --> 01:18:58.661]  It's funny.
[01:18:58.801 --> 01:19:01.081]  Every headline is brush fire, brush fire.
[01:19:01.722 --> 01:19:02.302]  Not at all.
[01:19:02.682 --> 01:19:06.343]  I've never seen a brush fire start a car on fire.
[01:19:06.983 --> 01:19:09.404]  Yeah, you could just hear these things just popping.
[01:19:09.824 --> 01:19:13.805]  And I understand the glass pops, but these cars ignited.
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:18.282]  And not one tree, not one shrub was damaged.
[01:19:18.322 --> 01:19:23.745]  The other thing I want to mention, Owen, is I'm a former pro athlete.
[01:19:23.946 --> 01:19:30.349]  I've traveled the world a lot playing tennis back in the early, mid, late 80s.
[01:19:31.030 --> 01:19:32.230]  And I never forget this.
[01:19:32.831 --> 01:19:39.515]  I was out of the country for several months, either traveling all throughout Europe.
[01:19:40.015 --> 01:19:42.856]  I stayed away from the, you know,
[01:19:44.167 --> 01:19:48.588]  The cold block countries, the communist countries, but I never forget, I had a couple weeks off.
[01:19:48.648 --> 01:19:59.651]  I stopped back in to see my father back in the States here and I told him, I said, you know, what you see on the news, I said, really, you want to believe the opposite?
[01:19:59.791 --> 01:20:01.711]  I said, that's not what's happening out there.
[01:20:02.712 --> 01:20:05.232]  And, uh, and then I made another statement to him.
[01:20:05.272 --> 01:20:12.274]  I said, you know, we're, we're, we're grown up in this country to believe Russia is this big, uh,
[01:20:13.361 --> 01:20:16.483]  Uh, you know, evil place that the corruption is so bad.
[01:20:17.183 --> 01:20:22.386]  Well, what I've learned over the years, Owen, is no, the United States is number one.
[01:20:23.226 --> 01:20:36.192]  And, uh, you know, and I hate, I almost hate to say this, but the last several years, 90, 95% of my business has been in China, uh, dealing with the Chinese.
[01:20:37.133 --> 01:20:41.535]  And that was with, you know, high end vehicles, um, you know, anything from used
[01:20:42.236 --> 01:20:44.057]  Use commercial aircraft, things like this.
[01:20:44.717 --> 01:20:48.319]  And so I do understand how these people operate over there.
[01:20:49.340 --> 01:20:55.323]  And it's, you know, and you're right in what you just said a few minutes ago.
[01:20:56.344 --> 01:21:00.906]  The Chinese don't want to lose us as a business, you know, by a partner.
[01:21:00.946 --> 01:21:03.248]  We're their biggest customer, the United States.
[01:21:04.348 --> 01:21:10.972]  And that gives me, you know, it gives more fuel to the fire that, hey, maybe all this is to lay out the 5G and
[01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:15.332]  You know, maybe this Bill Gates with his chip technology BS and everything.
[01:21:15.352 --> 01:21:18.313]  Yeah, they're pushing it through, but I gotta tell you something.
[01:21:18.453 --> 01:21:22.275]  I've done business with, I've been friends with several people.
[01:21:23.295 --> 01:21:25.736]  This is back in the, you know, 90s.
[01:21:27.817 --> 01:21:34.340]  There were friends and business partners with Donald Trump, who was back then, of course, was the big real estate mogul.
[01:21:34.981 --> 01:21:40.263]  And these were all, what I know about this guy, President Trump now,
[01:21:41.238 --> 01:21:52.295]  Is this guy thinks outside the box and he's a genius and I just hope to hell that this guy has the wagon circled over you know three or four times and he could
[01:21:53.311 --> 01:21:57.113]  Finally pull in and collapse this deal before it gets too far out of hand.
[01:21:57.253 --> 01:22:01.956]  Well as far as the Office of President is concerned, he may be the last hope this country has.
[01:22:02.837 --> 01:22:08.160]  And that's why we're all watching him and just begging him to make the right move at every turn.
[01:22:08.580 --> 01:22:10.962]  But you know, he said a couple things here that are key and that's
[01:22:12.125 --> 01:22:18.826]  You know, the purveyors of evil in this world fly the American flag as if they represent America, but that's a lie.
[01:22:19.527 --> 01:22:27.968]  And so just like the American people have been duped and have been goose-stepped and have been misled, so have the people of China.
[01:22:28.709 --> 01:22:32.049]  And it's obviously much worse for the people of China, but it's important to point that out.
[01:22:32.069 --> 01:22:39.271]  It's like, yeah, we've had the military-industrial complex, we've had the corrupt presidents, we've had all these crimes against humanity.
[01:22:41.175 --> 01:22:50.464]  With the false premise that this is what America wants, while the media is lying to us about it, and then they try to make us feel bad for these things when we had nothing to do with it.
[01:22:52.426 --> 01:22:55.068]  But the people in China are dealing with the same thing.
[01:22:56.009 --> 01:23:05.218]  And so we need to free the people of China, just like we need to free ourselves from these globalist traitors that have
[01:23:06.337 --> 01:23:11.318]  Lied us into wars, poisoned our water supply, all the same stuff.
[01:23:11.719 --> 01:23:17.300]  Just like we need to free ourselves of them, we need to help the Chinese people free themselves of the Chinese Communist Party.
[01:23:17.320 --> 01:23:18.160]  Thank you for the call, Greg.
[01:23:18.580 --> 01:23:20.461]  Let's go to Alex in New York.
[01:23:20.841 --> 01:23:21.521]  Go ahead, Alex.
[01:23:23.902 --> 01:23:25.002]  Hello, you can hear me?
[01:23:25.362 --> 01:23:25.943]  Yep, go ahead.
[01:23:27.443 --> 01:23:27.743]  Great.
[01:23:27.943 --> 01:23:28.983]  How are you doing, Alan?
[01:23:29.344 --> 01:23:30.684]  I have a small information.
[01:23:31.508 --> 01:23:47.554]  If you look back in 2010, the Mexican Gulf, British Petroleum spilled a bunch of oil, and they were asking scientists to make some bacteria that was going to help to clean up this spill all over.
[01:23:48.895 --> 01:23:53.137]  And they created a bacteria called Finti.
[01:23:54.077 --> 01:23:56.798]  You can look online, you can find all the information.
[01:23:57.679 --> 01:24:01.100]  And Finti is supposed to clean up the Gulf from the oil spill and help
[01:24:01.604 --> 01:24:02.244]  We're good.
[01:24:31.658 --> 01:24:35.962]  And it's exactly Cynthia killing stomach and gut of the human.
[01:24:36.603 --> 01:24:47.833]  In the beginning, right now, she's in the fish right now, but as temperature is raising up in the ocean right now, especially with summer coming, Cynthia is going to spread much more.
[01:24:48.174 --> 01:24:54.860]  It's also right now on the south of the Florida, on the east side, also on the west side of the Florida and south.
[01:24:55.472 --> 01:25:04.138]  Well, and remember, too, where you had Fukushima radiation leaking into the ocean as well, reaching, I mean, eventually it would reach California.
[01:25:04.198 --> 01:25:05.739]  Then they did the test of the beaches out there.
[01:25:05.759 --> 01:25:09.162]  They found all kinds of radiation and isotopes.
[01:25:09.902 --> 01:25:12.164]  They claimed none of it was from Fukushima, though.
[01:25:12.604 --> 01:25:14.686]  But yeah, that was killing the aquatic life.
[01:25:15.707 --> 01:25:18.829]  And, you know, nobody really is just like, oh, OK.
[01:25:19.869 --> 01:25:21.631]  Total nuclear disaster over there.
[01:25:22.981 --> 01:25:30.366]  And, you know, all the effects to the earth and the fish, but it's like, oh, global warming though.
[01:25:30.446 --> 01:25:33.348]  Yes, we all need to change our lifestyles for global warming.
[01:25:33.808 --> 01:25:39.192]  Don't worry about the radio leaks with Fukushima or whatever.
[01:25:39.232 --> 01:25:40.933]  Who even knows what's going on in California?
[01:25:40.953 --> 01:25:45.276]  They just, random radio isotopes show up on the beach and it's like, oh, okay, yeah.
[01:25:45.336 --> 01:25:46.237]  Where did these come from?
[01:25:46.337 --> 01:25:46.737]  Oh, I don't know.
[01:25:47.197 --> 01:25:50.800]  And then they test like bluefin tuna and they test all these fish.
[01:25:53.383 --> 01:26:01.768]  We're in the fallout zone from Fukushima and they're like all testing for cesium-137 and all this stuff and it's like nobody freaks out about that.
[01:26:02.368 --> 01:26:09.032]  Nobody panics about the nuclear plants that are literally called the devil, El Diablo, in California.
[01:26:09.152 --> 01:26:11.093]  One earthquake and it's total nuclear fallout.
[01:26:11.414 --> 01:26:18.298]  But no, you know, you are responsible for global warming so change your lifestyles and we're going to put nuclear plants on fault lines.
[01:26:19.537 --> 01:26:39.103]  The technocratic, globalist, enemy of humanity had this plan a long time ago to release this bio-agent, cause a worldwide panacdemic, and then usurp all powers unilaterally, funneling towards a one-world government with forced vaccinations and papers that you need to travel.
[01:26:39.663 --> 01:26:46.105]  Now, they went ahead with that anyway, even though Hillary Clinton, as the United States President, was a cornerstone of that plan.
[01:26:46.185 --> 01:26:47.425]  Trump has been a major roadblock.
[01:26:50.011 --> 01:26:54.813]  But understand this, the plan was for World War III with China this entire time.
[01:26:55.854 --> 01:27:01.256]  But it was going to be a fake war where the only real victor was the power structure.
[01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:07.739]  The only real victor were the elite that were responsible for starting this fake war.
[01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:17.644]  Now that Trump is in and it's all being exposed in America's awakening, we're looking at either a real World War III with China where the people of China could benefit
[01:27:18.376 --> 01:27:20.478]  With the Chinese Communist Party being abolished?
[01:27:21.559 --> 01:27:23.260]  In worldwide military tribunals?
[01:27:24.221 --> 01:27:29.706]  Where the American people can be financially free from the burdens placed on them by the unfair trade deals with China?
[01:27:29.986 --> 01:27:31.507]  The slave labor happening in China?
[01:27:31.568 --> 01:27:32.809]  All the manufacturing in China?
[01:27:33.669 --> 01:27:35.291]  That would be how the real war goes down.
[01:27:35.331 --> 01:27:37.132]  We'll see if Trump goes down that path or not.
[01:27:37.973 --> 01:27:42.998]  But if it would have been a fake war, World War III with China, potentially a billion would have died.
[01:27:43.956 --> 01:27:44.756]  Hey Owen, can you hear me?
[01:27:44.776 --> 01:27:44.916]  Great.
[01:27:44.936 --> 01:27:48.118]  Yeah, I just wanted to call in and you know, I've been all over this country pretty much and
[01:28:09.352 --> 01:28:23.322]  You know, when I went down to Florida a couple weeks ago, I was watching Fox News just right before I got there, and they're saying how the weigh stations are closed, cars are piling into the weigh station, getting checked and all that, blah blah blah blah.
[01:28:23.342 --> 01:28:26.125]  Of course, none of that's true at all whatsoever.
[01:28:26.145 --> 01:28:30.208]  And I was driving around Miami, you know, they said the military was on the ground.
[01:28:30.608 --> 01:28:35.832]  I didn't see nothing personally, which is another bunch of BS from, of course, our media.
[01:28:36.372 --> 01:28:38.514]  But, you know, throughout my travels,
[01:28:40.273 --> 01:28:45.437]  Every single person that I have talked to is so sick and tired of the shutdown.
[01:28:45.457 --> 01:28:49.560]  And, you know, I think it's great that you're holding that rally there in Austin.
[01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:50.821]  I wish I could be there for it.
[01:28:51.962 --> 01:28:55.685]  But there is more people than you absolutely know.
[01:28:56.385 --> 01:28:58.027]  People that don't even watch your show.
[01:28:58.567 --> 01:28:59.908]  I'll sit there and I'll talk to them.
[01:28:59.928 --> 01:29:01.509]  You know, they don't know nothing about Infant Wars.
[01:29:01.849 --> 01:29:03.531]  But they all come to the same conclusion.
[01:29:03.891 --> 01:29:04.792]  We're being duped.
[01:29:05.432 --> 01:29:06.853]  And that kind of gives me hope.
[01:29:07.394 --> 01:29:09.095]  Now, what should we do about it?
[01:29:10.001 --> 01:29:15.605]  Um, I think we should hold a, it's gotta be planned, you know, but hold a big ol' rally in Washington, D.C.
[01:29:15.645 --> 01:29:17.226]  Hats people ain't working anyways.
[01:29:17.926 --> 01:29:21.389]  You know, they can't stop us off from getting out there and rallying around.
[01:29:22.009 --> 01:29:28.293]  And, uh, as far as, uh, what Trump should do, um, Alex mentioned this a few, uh, while ago.
[01:29:28.313 --> 01:29:33.776]  Time to bring in the black ops and just put a bullet to each one of these sons of a gun's heads.
[01:29:34.317 --> 01:29:36.038]  You know, starting with Bill Gates on down.
[01:29:36.058 --> 01:29:37.499]  End it all, right there.
[01:29:39.121 --> 01:29:41.885]  Well look, a proper investigation of Bill Gates should be done.
[01:29:42.085 --> 01:29:43.106]  Zero doubt about that.
[01:29:43.206 --> 01:29:46.651]  Bill, thank you so much for that call and the analysis there.
[01:29:48.041 --> 01:29:50.343]  America is definitely fed up with this, folks.
[01:29:50.363 --> 01:29:53.625]  Apparently North Carolina's reopened after they had massive rallies this morning.
[01:29:53.685 --> 01:29:58.208]  Again, I'm hosting a rally in Austin, Texas, Saturday at noon at the Capitol building.
[01:29:58.228 --> 01:30:04.913]  Apparently there's already one happening Thursday at noon outside of the Governor's Mansion, which is just catty-cornered of the Capitol, so it's right there.
[01:30:05.653 --> 01:30:08.916]  So America's rising up against this, there's no doubt.
[01:30:09.136 --> 01:30:11.718]  And all these people that are waking up are probably freshly
[01:30:12.842 --> 01:30:17.846]  Let's call it red-pilled that are realizing how corrupt it's become and how out of control it's become.
[01:30:20.388 --> 01:30:32.118]  And so I guess we just kind of wait and see what our next response is if the government doesn't listen to we the people and reopen the country as it's due time.
[01:30:32.158 --> 01:30:33.479]  We can't take this anymore folks.
[01:30:33.659 --> 01:30:34.480]  One more week of this
[01:30:35.720 --> 01:30:37.742]  And supply lines will run dry.
[01:30:37.762 --> 01:30:40.584]  The meat plants are already not producing meat.
[01:30:41.084 --> 01:30:45.368]  The logistics companies that do freight and shipping are already shutting down.
[01:30:45.628 --> 01:30:47.469]  So you got about two weeks left.
[01:30:47.509 --> 01:30:52.653]  If we don't reopen this government, or if we don't reopen this country and this economy, it's not good.
[01:30:52.673 --> 01:30:54.575]  All right, special reports coming up then, Alex Jones.
[01:30:59.093 --> 01:31:06.115]  Nearly 2400 years ago in ancient Greece, Plato discussed the importance of population control.
[01:31:07.555 --> 01:31:11.396]  Aristotle advocated the use of abortion and infanticide.
[01:31:12.956 --> 01:31:18.798]  In 1798, an essay on the principle of population was written by Thomas Malthus.
[01:31:20.083 --> 01:31:27.992]  He outlined the idea of positive checks, which are diseases, wars, disasters, famines, and genocides.
[01:31:28.873 --> 01:31:38.044]  Malthus believed that these things should be utilized to increase the death rate, and believed that human misery was an absolute necessary consequence.
[01:31:40.669 --> 01:31:43.871]  In 1859, Charles Darwin published The Origin of Species.
[01:31:44.411 --> 01:31:53.057]  In it, Darwin only hinted at the implications of human populations, but his cousin, Sir Francis Galton, became obsessed with the idea.
[01:31:53.938 --> 01:32:09.108]  In 1883, Galton published Inquiries into Human Faculty and its Development, wherein he wrote that his intention is to touch on various topics more or less connected with that of the cultivation of race or, as we might call it,
[01:32:09.629 --> 01:32:15.567]  with eugenic the term comes from the greek word eugenics of noble birth
[01:32:17.239 --> 01:32:22.003]  In the early 20th century, eugenics became an academic discipline in universities.
[01:32:22.724 --> 01:32:26.307]  Organizations were formed and funded to win public support.
[01:32:27.068 --> 01:32:40.561]  The Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and the Cold Spring Harbor Institute rejected the idea that all humans are born equal and began selling the idea of cultivating a new master race of noble bloodlines.
[01:32:42.065 --> 01:32:47.247]  Planned Parenthood was formed in America by racial eugenics advocate Margaret Sanger.
[01:32:48.247 --> 01:32:59.311]  President of IBM, Thomas J. Watson, established a special subsidiary in Poland called Watson Business Machines to assist in the Nazi invasion of Poland.
[01:33:00.495 --> 01:33:07.181]  This business continued throughout the war, and IBM managed the entire operation from their headquarters in New York.
[01:33:08.282 --> 01:33:11.364]  During the Nuremberg trials, the Nazis quoted U.S.
[01:33:11.945 --> 01:33:15.708]  Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in their own defense.
[01:33:16.349 --> 01:33:20.692]  They claimed that their eugenics program was being run from the United States.
[01:33:21.873 --> 01:33:26.577]  The Nazis were rightly admonished for war crimes, but not Thomas Watson.
[01:33:27.198 --> 01:33:32.923]  He went on to create the IBM World Trade Corporation and passed IBM on to his son.
[01:33:33.804 --> 01:33:37.567]  His granddaughter ended up marrying Margaret Sanger's grandson.
[01:33:38.728 --> 01:33:48.517]  Bill Gates' father worked on the board for Planned Parenthood, and his mother worked on the corporate board for IBM, who Bill partnered with to create Microsoft.
[01:33:50.037 --> 01:33:58.320]  With no medical background, Bill Gates then went on to become the world's foremost pusher of vaccines and population control.
[01:34:00.101 --> 01:34:01.742]  Do you think this is all coincidence?
[01:34:03.643 --> 01:34:11.466]  The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation funds the WHO, the NIH, the CDC, and the UN.
[01:34:12.366 --> 01:34:18.929]  And now he is saying that until we get mass vaccinations, we might never be able to gather in groups.
[01:34:19.269 --> 01:34:24.791]  And which activities, like mass gatherings, may be, in a certain sense, more optional.
[01:34:24.951 --> 01:34:31.874]  And so until you're widely vaccinated, those may not come back at all.
[01:34:32.094 --> 01:34:37.517]  The president's coronavirus response team are all pushing the Bill Gates vaccination agenda.
[01:34:38.177 --> 01:34:42.420]  Dr. Fauci is on the leadership council for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:52.826]  In January of 2017, Anthony Fauci told a crowd at Georgetown University that there would be a surprise outbreak during the Trump presidency.
[01:34:53.266 --> 01:35:09.894]  There is no question that there will be a challenge to the coming administration in the arena of infectious diseases, both chronic infectious diseases in the sense of already ongoing disease, and we have certainly a large burden of that, but also there will be a surprise outbreak.
[01:35:10.834 --> 01:35:22.440]  Deborah Birx is a board member for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria, which was founded by the Gates Foundation and known for millions of dollars of fraudulent misuse of funds.
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:33.108]  In October of 2019, Bill Gates sponsored Event 201, a simulation that estimated 65 million people killed by coronavirus.
[01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:50.743]  In November of 2019, the Peer Bright Institute, funded by Bill Gates, was granted European patent number EP3172319B1 for a coronavirus vaccine that may be used to treat humans.
[01:35:51.684 --> 01:35:58.650]  Today, Dr. Fauci says the virus will keep coming back, and he says the ultimate game-changer will be a new vaccine.
[01:35:59.651 --> 01:36:10.821]  In Australia, the Prime Minister is telling people the shutdown will last months, that it's the new normal, and that the only way out of your homes is to accept the vaccine.
[01:36:12.011 --> 01:36:14.552]  There is no proof that vaccines are the answer.
[01:36:15.132 --> 01:36:23.153]  In fact, the CDC admitted in federal court that it does not have studies to support the claim that vaccines do not cause autism.
[01:36:24.654 --> 01:36:28.674]  A top UN scientist admitted that vaccines are killing people.
[01:36:30.175 --> 01:36:32.015]  It is time to do some hard thinking.
[01:36:32.895 --> 01:36:36.296]  Will you allow your government to impose forced vaccinations?
[01:36:38.196 --> 01:36:40.377]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:36:46.684 --> 01:36:59.207]  In the intelligence community, a limited hangout is the deliberate revelation of some information about malfeasance to try to confuse and or prevent discovery of other information.
[01:37:00.087 --> 01:37:12.850]  In a recent Daily Mail article, the Communist Chinese admit, after four months of denial, that the COVID-19 virus resulted from work being done in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:15.671]  and was paid for by the U.S.
[01:37:15.731 --> 01:37:22.873]  National Institute of Health, run by none other than Anthony Fauci during the Obama administration.
[01:37:23.833 --> 01:37:42.539]  In the article, the CCP admits to harvesting their bats from a single cave in Yunnan, China, thereby vindicating the work of Indian researchers who scanned its genome and found evidence that COVID-19 is a man-made hybrid, also known as a chimera virus.
[01:37:43.499 --> 01:37:58.116]  Controversy sparked in 2015 over the creation of a chimeric SARS-like virus at the University of North Carolina, and a moratorium was enacted to end gain-of-function research in the United States.
[01:37:59.384 --> 01:38:06.109]  Gain-of-function research involves genetically increasing the transmissibility of deadly pathogens.
[01:38:07.050 --> 01:38:19.639]  Immediately following this moratorium, the Obama administration and the National Institute of Health under Dr. Anthony Fauci outsourced the work to the Wuhan Virology Lab in China.
[01:38:20.499 --> 01:38:31.927]  The NIH awarded $3.7 million in research grants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology for gain-of-function coronavirus experimentation on bats.
[01:38:32.888 --> 01:38:45.556]  The Wuhan Institute lists the NIH as a partner, as well as the University of Alabama, the University of North Texas, Harvard University, and the National Wildlife Federation.
[01:38:46.577 --> 01:38:55.124]  The CCP still claims that it was an accident, suggesting that the innocent bat experiments may have gotten out of control.
[01:38:55.725 --> 01:39:05.632]  But the admission is that COVID-19 came from the Wuhan laboratory and it was paid for and directed by Anthony Fauci and the NIH.
[01:39:06.453 --> 01:39:14.700]  The very same Fauci who is now suggesting extended lockdowns and mandatory vaccinations in the United States.
[01:39:16.391 --> 01:39:30.182]  As the world increasingly blames China for the COVID-19 virus, the CCP has fired a not-so-subtle warning shot across the bow of their American deep state accomplices.
[01:39:31.483 --> 01:39:37.807]  A massive war with China could potentially make all talk of deep state corruption vanish.
[01:39:39.729 --> 01:39:42.371]  Reporting for InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:39:49.019 --> 01:39:53.382]  I saved tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of lives by putting it on.
[01:39:53.402 --> 01:39:58.887]  The argument is that you bought yourself some time, you didn't use it to prepare hospitals, you didn't use it to ramp up testing.
[01:39:59.247 --> 01:40:01.509]  You're so disgraceful.
[01:40:01.609 --> 01:40:03.430]  It's so disgraceful the way you say that.
[01:40:03.490 --> 01:40:06.773]  Let me just... Listen, I just went over it.
[01:40:06.853 --> 01:40:07.933]  I just went over it.
[01:40:07.954 --> 01:40:09.275]  Nobody thought we should do it.
[01:40:09.335 --> 01:40:10.475]  And when I did it...
[01:40:15.339 --> 01:40:16.881]  You know what we did?
[01:40:18.283 --> 01:40:20.747]  You know what we did?
[01:40:20.847 --> 01:40:27.857]  What do you do, what do you do when you have no case in the whole United States, when you, excuse me, you reported it.
[01:40:28.397 --> 01:40:31.341]  Zero cases, zero deaths on January 17th.
[01:40:33.284 --> 01:40:35.327]  January.
[01:40:35.707 --> 01:40:37.009]  I said in January.
[01:40:38.410 --> 01:40:40.953]  On January 30th.
[01:40:40.974 --> 01:40:41.935]  A lot.
[01:40:41.955 --> 01:40:42.335]  A lot.
[01:40:42.616 --> 01:40:44.818]  And in fact, we'll give you a list what we did.
[01:40:44.858 --> 01:40:46.160]  In fact, part of it was up there.
[01:40:46.641 --> 01:40:47.542]  We did a lot.
[01:40:47.822 --> 01:40:48.383]  Look, look.
[01:40:49.482 --> 01:40:50.323]  You know you're a fake.
[01:40:50.683 --> 01:40:53.666]  You know that your whole network, the way you cover it, is fake.
[01:40:53.986 --> 01:40:57.250]  And most of you, and not all of you, but the people are wise to you.
[01:40:57.290 --> 01:41:02.535]  That's why you have a lower approval rating than you've ever had before, times probably three.
[01:41:03.156 --> 01:41:09.181]  And when you ask me that question, let me ask you this, why didn't Biden, why didn't Biden apologize?
[01:41:09.502 --> 01:41:11.424]  Why did he write a letter of apology?
[01:41:11.444 --> 01:41:13.286]  No, that's very important.
[01:41:13.846 --> 01:41:16.489]  Why did the Democrats think that I acted too quickly?
[01:41:16.790 --> 01:41:17.350]  You know why?
[01:41:17.731 --> 01:41:19.854]  Because they really thought that I acted too quickly.
[01:41:20.775 --> 01:41:21.976]  We have done a great job.
[01:41:22.056 --> 01:41:23.118]  Now, I could have.
[01:41:23.879 --> 01:41:25.481]  I could have kept it open.
[01:41:26.081 --> 01:41:28.644]  And I could have done what some countries are doing.
[01:41:28.725 --> 01:41:29.205]  They're getting
[01:41:30.006 --> 01:41:30.326]  I think so.
[01:41:53.905 --> 01:41:54.646]  Doesn't cover it.
[01:41:55.206 --> 01:42:02.331]  Ladies and gentlemen, the press in this country, the corporate press, is bought and paid for by multinational corporations outlawed by Communist China.
[01:42:02.351 --> 01:42:02.991]  We all know that.
[01:42:04.993 --> 01:42:11.797]  And as it all begins to come out and unfold, they're going to get more desperate, they're going to get more out of control.
[01:42:13.398 --> 01:42:16.781]  And what they're doing right now is, in blue states they control
[01:42:17.887 --> 01:42:18.387]  And in U.S.
[01:42:18.447 --> 01:42:20.028]  attorney's offices they control.
[01:42:20.908 --> 01:42:35.313]  They're going around through everybody's bank records, their tax records over the decades, and they are calling up people saying, if you don't come out against Trump and if you don't support the destruction of the country, we're going to indict you.
[01:42:36.393 --> 01:42:40.995]  And because Trump hasn't gotten control of the Justice Department, and it just operates
[01:42:42.225 --> 01:42:44.546]  Still run by Hillary and Obama in the deep state.
[01:42:45.106 --> 01:42:47.228]  They were allowed to terrorize the American people.
[01:42:47.748 --> 01:42:52.850]  And most people, when they get threatened with indictments or worse, back down.
[01:42:54.431 --> 01:43:01.755]  And so it's a real miracle that members of Congress, after being lied about having people come to their houses, threatened to kill them.
[01:43:02.844 --> 01:43:11.191]  Like the Senate Majority Leader, after having their ribs broken, like Rand Paul, after being shot with bullets by Congressman Scalise, that they're holding the line.
[01:43:11.911 --> 01:43:16.535]  But, you see, they're holding the line instead of ever going on the offense against these criminals.
[01:43:17.916 --> 01:43:31.586]  And so, because all those indictments we heard about for people that committed massive crimes, because that never happened, by extension, Trump and the Justice Department at the top are authorizing this scorched earth policy
[01:43:32.563 --> 01:43:33.323]  It's being carried out.
[01:43:33.423 --> 01:43:38.985]  It's now a stay-at-home order for most Americans and a death sentence for small businesses.
[01:43:39.785 --> 01:43:41.805]  And now the Democrats are putting strings on all the money.
[01:43:42.685 --> 01:43:45.126]  And so we're going into economic depression.
[01:43:46.786 --> 01:43:50.347]  And so as bad as the persecution has been against Infowars, I expected this.
[01:43:50.907 --> 01:43:52.968]  I even predicted they'd use a bioweapon to carry it out.
[01:43:54.688 --> 01:43:57.769]  But now people ask, well, how are you handling it?
[01:43:59.069 --> 01:44:00.490]  Well, I know how the president's handling it.
[01:44:00.890 --> 01:44:01.790]  He's completely surrounded.
[01:44:03.467 --> 01:44:19.612]  And so are the American people, by criminals, who've never gotten in trouble and who are like spoiled three-year-olds throwing fits and overturning the dinner table and kicking their parents in the shins because they've never been put in their place.
[01:44:20.993 --> 01:44:28.115]  And they are collections of soft, stupid, corrupt, blackmailed individuals in corporate America and in
[01:44:29.417 --> 01:44:33.539]  Main Street America and in Wall Street America and in Washington, D.C.
[01:44:35.380 --> 01:44:37.020]  And so this country really has cancer.
[01:44:38.441 --> 01:44:39.862]  And we've seen a lot of good happen.
[01:44:39.882 --> 01:44:41.282]  A lot of this has been turned around.
[01:44:41.342 --> 01:44:44.064]  A lot of what the globalists have been up to is being exposed.
[01:44:44.124 --> 01:44:51.487]  But that's only elicited them to come charging out of their rat's nest, attacking even more ferociously.
[01:44:52.647 --> 01:44:58.190]  See, America for the last 50 years or so has just been go along to get along while we were being robbed blind.
[01:44:59.161 --> 01:45:03.506]  And a lot of adults, a lot of older people think, well if you just go on and get along, it'll be like last time, it'll be okay.
[01:45:03.546 --> 01:45:03.706]  No.
[01:45:04.447 --> 01:45:07.210]  We're up to slaughtering the pig time at Christmas.
[01:45:07.690 --> 01:45:10.673]  The pig's been out there for a couple years, growing, getting fattened up.
[01:45:11.254 --> 01:45:18.482]  And the next time it gets let out of the gate, it doesn't know it's being led to be, you know, hauled up by its feet and its throat slit and be cut up into pork chops.
[01:45:19.585 --> 01:45:25.768]  We're now at the pork chop level, and they're walking over with the knife to reach down and pat us.
[01:45:25.788 --> 01:45:32.850]  You know, they usually give you a carrot, or a tomato, or something, or maybe a radish, or an apple.
[01:45:32.910 --> 01:45:38.093]  But this time, it's just a quick knife, razor sharp, across the carotid arteries.
[01:45:38.953 --> 01:45:44.675]  And I'm sitting there, watching history, knowing what's happening, and I'm watching them sharpen the knife up on the front porch.
[01:45:47.839 --> 01:45:49.200]  And they're saying, I'm gonna go slip them.
[01:45:49.620 --> 01:45:50.601]  I'm gonna go butcher.
[01:45:50.621 --> 01:45:57.146]  I'm gonna go butcher Candy or Brady or whatever the pig's name is.
[01:45:58.787 --> 01:45:59.388]  And they do it.
[01:46:02.090 --> 01:46:03.591]  You know, that's part of growing up on a farm.
[01:46:03.671 --> 01:46:18.363]  I didn't grow up on a farm, but my grandparents were on a farm, and my dad's parents, and you know, it wasn't a big deal, but a few times I happened to be there when they were slaughtering an animal, and they were like, yeah, we like old such and such, but it's time to chop them up, put them in the deep freeze, we'll have some good steaks tonight.
[01:46:19.278 --> 01:46:29.421]  You just go out and shoot him, shoot your cow, right in the head with a .22, just walk up, shoot, falls right over, haul it up with a tractor on chains, slit its throat, bleed the meat out, and butcher it right there.
[01:46:29.441 --> 01:46:33.043]  You spend like five hours butchering the cow and eat fresh steaks that night.
[01:46:33.603 --> 01:46:36.184]  This meat goes to hamburger, you grind that up, this goes to that.
[01:46:36.564 --> 01:46:44.707]  And this is just a process of rendering down America, breaking your will, making you desperate, absolutely teaching you total submission.
[01:46:46.787 --> 01:46:48.228]  So I have a lot of sorrow
[01:46:49.636 --> 01:46:56.320]  For the fact that we're run by these psychotics, but if America doesn't stand up and say no, it's really what we deserve.
[01:46:58.222 --> 01:47:00.283]  So I'm going to cover some of this news when we come back.
[01:47:00.723 --> 01:47:01.944]  I was going to take two days off.
[01:47:01.964 --> 01:47:05.466]  It's like every time I take off, take my children fishing or something.
[01:47:08.126 --> 01:47:08.886]  Out at that very farm.
[01:47:08.946 --> 01:47:10.067]  I was talking about having been there in years.
[01:47:10.207 --> 01:47:10.767]  Family farm.
[01:47:11.387 --> 01:47:16.349]  The minute I'm going to go do something like that, this all happens and stuff breaks loose.
[01:47:17.210 --> 01:47:21.451]  And, you know, behind the scenes, the establishment's like, OK, well, you defeated this.
[01:47:21.511 --> 01:47:22.171]  You defeated that.
[01:47:22.211 --> 01:47:23.252]  You stood up to this.
[01:47:23.892 --> 01:47:26.753]  How about we put your ass in prison?
[01:47:27.213 --> 01:47:28.534]  Well, the whole country's in prison.
[01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:30.640]  You know, what's next?
[01:47:30.660 --> 01:47:31.541]  We'll put a bullet in your head?
[01:47:31.901 --> 01:47:33.582]  I mean, you're putting a bullet in the country's head.
[01:47:33.942 --> 01:47:37.964]  You want to put a forced vaccine in all of us that Bill Gates admits will kill a bunch of people?
[01:47:38.304 --> 01:47:40.945]  I mean, it's like, what do you think's going on here?
[01:47:41.005 --> 01:47:49.530]  Just because organized crime took this country over and you think every place is New York or LA or Baltimore, Maryland, it's not.
[01:47:50.373 --> 01:47:52.274]  And they've taken our restraint as weakness.
[01:47:52.314 --> 01:47:53.395]  That's not what's happening.
[01:47:54.175 --> 01:47:54.855]  They're going to lose.
[01:47:54.895 --> 01:47:55.616]  They are losing.
[01:47:56.116 --> 01:47:58.817]  But for those of us at the tip of the spear, it's going to be hard.
[01:47:58.857 --> 01:47:59.338]  But you know what?
[01:47:59.758 --> 01:48:01.459]  I'm glad to be here and I'm proud to be in this position.
[01:48:01.919 --> 01:48:03.080]  I'm more happy than I've ever been.
[01:48:03.460 --> 01:48:04.180]  I'm more fulfilled.
[01:48:05.301 --> 01:48:06.041]  I can face God.
[01:48:06.581 --> 01:48:07.002]  You can't.
[01:48:09.143 --> 01:48:12.945]  You go out looking for dragons to slay, someday you'll find them.
[01:48:14.265 --> 01:48:15.706]  And you'll get what you wanted.
[01:48:16.466 --> 01:48:17.467]  Your destiny.
[01:48:19.915 --> 01:48:23.320]  Well, I got up this morning and there was a headline.
[01:48:23.841 --> 01:48:28.146]  Governors on the West and East Coast form an alliance!
[01:48:29.702 --> 01:48:30.522]  Against Trump.
[01:48:31.482 --> 01:48:32.723]  They said science!
[01:48:33.063 --> 01:48:39.564]  That means the UN, the CHICOMS, FAUCI that allow the NIH to transfer the bioweapons to China on record.
[01:48:40.084 --> 01:48:50.786]  The scientific dictatorship will dictate not the president, not Congress, but the governors interpreting what scientists they want to hear from.
[01:48:50.806 --> 01:48:57.208]  But we have Cuomo saying just two days ago that all the projections were wrong between 9, 10, 15, 20 times higher.
[01:48:59.847 --> 01:49:02.409]  In their death rates, that won't really happen.
[01:49:03.990 --> 01:49:11.554]  And you look at the governor of Michigan walking around like a crazed jack-o'-lantern loon, and Cuomo all jacked up and crazy.
[01:49:14.276 --> 01:49:25.563]  Cuomo's brother, Chris Cuomo, came out in an interview that we should air next segment, and he said, you know, people hate me out in public now, but I let them know I hate them too, but this isn't what I wanted.
[01:49:25.663 --> 01:49:27.224]  I mean, I want to be nice.
[01:49:27.284 --> 01:49:28.444]  I want to be bipartisan.
[01:49:28.885 --> 01:49:29.305]  Yeah, right.
[01:49:30.728 --> 01:49:32.109]  They're feeling the heat, folks.
[01:49:33.649 --> 01:49:39.572]  They think they're going to break all the rules and commit all these crimes and do all these things and that it won't come back on them.
[01:49:41.573 --> 01:49:45.635]  They're nothing but scared little puppets that go to other little puppets.
[01:49:46.215 --> 01:49:57.560]  And they have these roundtables, these committees of corrupt, mainly men and big corporations that sit around and do deals with dictators and do deals with authoritarian regimes.
[01:49:57.900 --> 01:49:59.541]  They don't like open, free countries.
[01:50:01.752 --> 01:50:10.237]  And they've decided to get rid of the checks and balances because they believe their multinational corporations can play the countries off against each other and the people off against each other and be the new robber barons of the planet.
[01:50:10.517 --> 01:50:11.538]  It's not going to go that way.
[01:50:13.379 --> 01:50:22.365]  You go to any Cuomo comment page that's open, you go to any place where they're talking about Bill Gates, and it's 99% negative.
[01:50:24.666 --> 01:50:25.607]  Look at their champion.
[01:50:26.507 --> 01:50:27.388]  He can't even talk.
[01:50:28.068 --> 01:50:28.488]  Joe Biden.
[01:50:28.889 --> 01:50:30.690]  He's so emblematic of their delusion.
[01:50:33.055 --> 01:50:40.919]  And so they peck and scrape in the dust trying to find some plan, some idea to blackmail or intimidate their opposition.
[01:50:41.179 --> 01:50:43.140]  And now they're noticing it isn't working anymore.
[01:50:43.740 --> 01:50:45.441]  So they have to up the intimidation.
[01:50:45.461 --> 01:50:46.862]  They have to up the threats.
[01:50:46.902 --> 01:50:50.864]  They have to up the scams in a hope that people will finally bow down to them again.
[01:50:53.462 --> 01:51:05.528]  This country is in a civil war with one faction that hates the country, doesn't want it to exist, and that has literally been feeding off it for decades, and another faction that just wants to stop being bullied and lied about.
[01:51:08.089 --> 01:51:17.254]  So you have the states on the West Coast, the East Coast, that don't believe countries and borders even exist, coming out and saying, we're going to block Trump reopening the country.
[01:51:17.594 --> 01:51:20.395]  How many times did I say the last 8, 9, 10 weeks that
[01:51:22.841 --> 01:51:25.704]  They'll say Trump didn't do enough, even though he's the one doing something.
[01:51:25.724 --> 01:51:30.429]  Then they'll say that he's doing a good job when he finally shuts things down completely.
[01:51:32.371 --> 01:51:33.713]  See, they want it to get bad first.
[01:51:34.093 --> 01:51:35.094]  First, like, oh, everything's fine.
[01:51:35.134 --> 01:51:35.895]  Don't block the borders.
[01:51:36.196 --> 01:51:37.117]  Don't block Chinese flights.
[01:51:37.197 --> 01:51:39.559]  Once they have some death, oh my God, it's your fault.
[01:51:39.579 --> 01:51:40.781]  You've got to shut everything down completely.
[01:51:41.021 --> 01:51:42.823]  And then, by the way, you're never going to reopen it.
[01:51:44.298 --> 01:51:53.304]  Even though all the metrics show it's already causing millions of people to be at starvation and to starve to death, half a billion people sliding into absolute near starvation levels.
[01:51:54.685 --> 01:51:59.608]  But they won't be memorialized or humanized or focused on.
[01:52:00.749 --> 01:52:07.193]  They won't be spotlighted, those actually starving to death, the mother that has to decide which one of her three children to feed and which other two to allow die.
[01:52:07.293 --> 01:52:08.054]  That's confirmed.
[01:52:11.271 --> 01:52:11.991]  Now there's the New York Times.
[01:52:12.092 --> 01:52:14.053]  Death by coronavirus or hunger?
[01:52:14.253 --> 01:52:15.774]  Well, millions of dead from hunger.
[01:52:16.374 --> 01:52:17.695]  They're saying like two million about to die.
[01:52:18.176 --> 01:52:19.456]  More than, you know, double the normal.
[01:52:19.797 --> 01:52:20.697]  But that's okay.
[01:52:20.757 --> 01:52:22.478]  Ten plus million die a year anyways, right?
[01:52:23.439 --> 01:52:24.540]  They're saying tens of millions.
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:27.402]  If it continues, there's a global depression, which is already in most areas.
[01:52:29.155 --> 01:52:31.978]  But it's about the corporations grabbing power and control.
[01:52:32.279 --> 01:52:33.019]  They're essential.
[01:52:33.300 --> 01:52:37.545]  Your business, your home, your right to travel, your right to whatever does it.
[01:52:37.685 --> 01:52:45.534]  They decide with an app they've already got for you with Google and Apple merging to carry that out.
[01:52:47.639 --> 01:52:50.040]  Because it turns out those companies weren't separate all along, folks.
[01:52:50.060 --> 01:52:51.560]  That was a con game for the stockholders.
[01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:52.981]  That was to get around the monopoly laws.
[01:52:53.221 --> 01:52:59.923]  They're not going to need that anymore because they're all unifying, just like China did five years ago, making Xi Jinping dictator for life.
[01:53:01.064 --> 01:53:12.988]  He was already a dictator, but it always consolidates down, demanding more fealty, more subservience, more slavery in any system until you vertically integrate into an absolute top-down North Korean nightmare.
[01:53:14.514 --> 01:53:18.037]  What did President Trump say about this this morning in probably one of his most epic tweets?
[01:53:19.478 --> 01:53:24.962]  Tell the Democrat governors that Mutiny on the Bounty was one of my all-time favorite movies.
[01:53:25.022 --> 01:53:29.926]  A good old-fashioned mutiny every now and then is exciting and invigorating thing to watch.
[01:53:30.927 --> 01:53:35.090]  Especially when the mutineers need so much from the captain too easy.
[01:53:38.234 --> 01:53:45.259]  Well, I hope that's the case, Mr. President, because they still think they're going to remove you and then they'll charge Stone and throw him in jail for 20 years.
[01:53:45.939 --> 01:53:49.962]  They still think they're going to remove you and then shut down what's left of Fox News.
[01:53:51.563 --> 01:53:56.646]  They still think they're going to remove you and then be able to throw my ass in prison for no reason.
[01:53:59.328 --> 01:54:02.330]  And have a reign of terror against the American people, who the globalists hate.
[01:54:03.131 --> 01:54:07.914]  Because the idea of our spirit, if we ever realized our birthright and rediscovered it, could defeat them.
[01:54:10.083 --> 01:54:11.804]  So we need bold action, Mr. President.
[01:54:12.264 --> 01:54:16.767]  You try to play ball with these people, you try to be nice to them, share power with them, they take it as weakness.
[01:54:18.348 --> 01:54:22.390]  Why haven't you pardoned Julian Assange that you told to release the WikiLeaks?
[01:54:24.911 --> 01:54:25.151]  Why?
[01:54:27.793 --> 01:54:34.737]  Why have you sat there and allowed the globalists to commit all these incredible crimes?
[01:54:36.556 --> 01:54:38.517]  I understand you're surrounded by a bunch of cowards.
[01:54:38.537 --> 01:54:40.939]  If they tell you one thing and do another, that's come out.
[01:54:40.979 --> 01:54:41.520]  We understand.
[01:54:41.740 --> 01:54:44.522]  You sign an executive order, they think you forget about it and put it under a piece of paper.
[01:54:45.282 --> 01:54:51.927]  That disdain they have for you, that seizure of power at the managerial role is criminal mutiny.
[01:54:52.587 --> 01:55:04.596]  So I'm glad you talk about mutiny, Mr. President, because I've called it mutiny within the federal government by the bureaucracy, and a coup not just against you, but against the American people and the very rule of law.
[01:55:07.349 --> 01:55:08.389]  That's where we are right now.
[01:55:09.310 --> 01:55:11.591]  We are not going over the edge of the cliff.
[01:55:11.731 --> 01:55:13.051]  We've gone over the edge of the cliff.
[01:55:14.412 --> 01:55:20.234]  And listeners and viewers of this broadcast need to know, you are not spectators.
[01:55:20.254 --> 01:55:21.514]  You are men and women in the arena.
[01:55:21.714 --> 01:55:35.159]  And now that hypothetical medical tyranny, world government complete with enforced inoculations and implantable microchips isn't a thing of the future.
[01:55:35.559 --> 01:55:36.540]  It's a thing of the now.
[01:55:38.203 --> 01:55:46.348]  And I cannot be allowed to be on air much longer when everything we've talked about is now becoming manifest reality, which was already reality behind the scenes.
[01:55:46.709 --> 01:55:59.057]  You ever seen the old films of a big ship or a battleship or a frigate, a submarine, and it's on the blocks and they unveil the curtains and they cut the blocks and the big ship slides into the water?
[01:56:01.388 --> 01:56:02.329]  I was behind the curtain.
[01:56:02.369 --> 01:56:04.132]  I saw the attack ship.
[01:56:04.192 --> 01:56:05.113]  I saw the armies.
[01:56:05.173 --> 01:56:06.034]  I saw the globalists.
[01:56:06.074 --> 01:56:08.738]  I saw their plans beta-tested on innocent populations.
[01:56:09.198 --> 01:56:11.381]  I came out and told you, hey, behind those curtains is this.
[01:56:11.802 --> 01:56:19.471]  A medical tyranny, forced inoculation, robots controlling you, forced sterilization of your children if you want to get your universal income.
[01:56:20.768 --> 01:56:28.310]  And now they've unveiled it, cut the blocks, it hit the water, and now it swings guns around, it's firing at us right now.
[01:56:29.010 --> 01:56:32.851]  And I'm just here going, wow, ladies and gentlemen, what are we gonna do?
[01:56:33.732 --> 01:56:36.752]  They pulled back the curtains, they cut the blocks, they launched the ship.
[01:56:38.013 --> 01:56:38.993]  And now it's running us over.
[01:56:43.746 --> 01:56:47.027]  They're not busting a bottle of champagne on the bowel of it.
[01:56:47.347 --> 01:56:47.927]  They're christening it.
[01:56:47.947 --> 01:56:49.128]  They're busting it over our head.
[01:56:49.528 --> 01:56:50.948]  People ask, how are you handling it, Alex?
[01:56:50.968 --> 01:56:51.689]  How are you handling it?
[01:56:52.289 --> 01:56:54.230]  I mean, I'm already prepared to die.
[01:56:54.250 --> 01:56:56.650]  I mean, I'm not worried about me.
[01:56:57.010 --> 01:56:58.211]  I'm worried about our children, folks.
[01:56:58.231 --> 01:57:00.952]  They're coming with sterilization cancer vaccines.
[01:57:01.132 --> 01:57:03.293]  They're coming to kill us with a soft kill weapon.
[01:57:04.953 --> 01:57:07.134]  Well, if you're driving down the highway through New Mexico,
[01:57:08.786 --> 01:57:16.231]  You come up to a rise, and you got a road map that tells you Albuquerque is right over those hills as you go down into that basin.
[01:57:17.051 --> 01:57:24.316]  And sure enough, you may have never been there in your life, but you crest the top, and there's the city at night down beneath you.
[01:57:25.596 --> 01:57:26.417]  Sure enough, it's there.
[01:57:28.498 --> 01:57:33.161]  But that's a happy thing, a nice destination you're going to.
[01:57:34.702 --> 01:57:35.583]  Well, imagine
[01:57:36.860 --> 01:58:01.324]  If you're looking at the roadmap and you know it leads to depopulation, human slavery, a post-human world, a medical tyranny that takes control of civilization and then slowly poisons the population to death while posing as their saviors, what would you do if you were on a bus being taken to that place and you'd been there before and you'd escaped it
[01:58:04.372 --> 01:58:12.975]  And now you're warning people on the bus that they're not being taken to a seaside resort or to a mountain retreat or to a pretty basin.
[01:58:13.675 --> 01:58:15.455]  They're being taken to a very bad place.
[01:58:16.396 --> 01:58:23.018]  What would it be like to know your wife, your children, your culture, your country, the whole world was being taken to a horrible place?
[01:58:24.278 --> 01:58:30.520]  You wouldn't care about yourself because there's not going to be a world to live in by yourself if this thing wins.
[01:58:31.502 --> 01:58:43.226]  And it's so frustrating to know this thing is so evil and so bad, and it's got so many cowards following its orders, that it ensures our destruction, at least for a long time to come.
[01:58:45.427 --> 01:58:46.927]  And there's no point in going there.
[01:58:47.447 --> 01:58:51.789]  All we had to do was have our chivalry, have our honor, have our courage, have our truth.
[01:58:53.069 --> 01:58:53.970]  And then exercise it.
[01:58:54.970 --> 01:58:57.891]  I can follow trajectories like anybody can.
[01:58:59.391 --> 01:59:00.192]  That road we're on.
[01:59:01.266 --> 01:59:07.891]  And if you look at the attacks that the election was illegitimate and then that Trump was a tyrant and all that.
[01:59:09.953 --> 01:59:19.880]  That was the beta test because they thought well if this works it doesn't destabilize things as bad and then we can carry out our plans later to shut down the world economy and bring the public to their knees.
[01:59:20.181 --> 01:59:24.064]  We need to get rid of Trump first because if he's in there we don't want to carry this out yet.
[01:59:24.264 --> 01:59:30.629]  They had the white papers and the blueprints and the event 201 things on the drawing board and
[01:59:31.872 --> 01:59:43.478]  Operations like Lockstep, the Rockefeller Foundation, and they were intending right around this time, 2020, to be launching the virus scare and that's why they cooked it up in China and got it all ready and Fauci oversaw those operations.
[01:59:45.759 --> 01:59:55.964]  But they were so feverish about getting Trump out of office and isolating him because they wanted to carry this out with him not in power.
[01:59:57.985 --> 02:00:01.347]  Because now having him there, even surrounded by a bunch of cowards and dunces,
[02:00:04.295 --> 02:00:09.657]  They're using the media and the big corporations to coordinate the lockdown, but he's there challenging it.
[02:00:10.297 --> 02:00:23.302]  When he realized the public had been caught in the hysteria, he went with it, but only to have credibility to be able to try to turn it back, as he's now doing with an alliance of Republican governors led by folks like Mr. Abbott, Governor Abbott.
[02:00:26.443 --> 02:00:28.204]  So if you follow this trajectory,
[02:00:32.347 --> 02:00:33.907]  This is the time they'll kill Trump.
[02:00:34.587 --> 02:00:36.168]  In the next couple weeks, the next few months.
[02:00:38.808 --> 02:00:41.589]  And this is the time that they'll drug him and say he had a stroke.
[02:00:42.009 --> 02:00:43.169]  That's another road.
[02:00:43.549 --> 02:00:46.249]  And then have, you know, his cabinet bring in a new president.
[02:00:46.590 --> 02:00:48.670]  But they're not sure they've got Pence.
[02:00:49.330 --> 02:00:54.311]  There's been a lot of whisper campaigns against Pence from the fake right wing, because Pence looks like he's actually good.
[02:00:55.891 --> 02:00:58.792]  And Trump daily is gaining more control over the executive branch.
[02:00:58.812 --> 02:01:00.172]  They don't know what to do, but I can tell you,
[02:01:02.674 --> 02:01:05.635]  That the establishment is losing power and they're really scared.
[02:01:05.655 --> 02:01:08.855]  They know they've committed all these crimes and they launched COVID-19.
[02:01:08.895 --> 02:01:25.299]  Which they already have again on the drawing board and off the shelf ready to go later to bring in world government, bring in medical tyranny, bring in forced inoculation, bring in depopulation, bring in the digital global ID to track you, the implantable ink microchip.
[02:01:25.319 --> 02:01:26.719]  I mean it's all now here.
[02:01:29.244 --> 02:01:41.149]  But they've now executed it to hold the country fully hostage and to have the Democrat governors say, we're going to hold you hostage, and we're going to run a blockade, a naval blockade.
[02:01:41.470 --> 02:01:48.153]  You know, Trump's using mutiny on the bounty as a naval analogy, so I use the naval analogy of big ships on their blocks.
[02:01:48.793 --> 02:01:57.337]  But how about the analogy of a blockade, a naval blockade, where you lay siege to, say, Gibraltar?
[02:02:00.285 --> 02:02:00.926]  We're good to go.
[02:02:17.537 --> 02:02:20.339]  They're gonna block ships with food and material coming in.
[02:02:20.639 --> 02:02:21.279]  An act of war.
[02:02:21.600 --> 02:02:26.503]  So what the Democrats are really saying is, we're going to lay siege to America.
[02:02:26.543 --> 02:02:27.203]  That's the headline.
[02:02:27.223 --> 02:02:34.348]  It's like, the media's like, well look out Trump, you say you'll stand up to the Democrat governors on the East and West Coast, we control all the ports.
[02:02:34.968 --> 02:02:38.951]  We'll cut America off like happened in the Civil War against the South.
[02:02:39.471 --> 02:02:44.134]  I mean, you see how this rapidly, day by day, is escalating into insane times?
[02:02:46.906 --> 02:02:48.847]  But you could argue who was in the right in the Civil War.
[02:02:51.248 --> 02:02:55.609]  And some said, oh, they thought Obama would have a Civil War and be Lincoln-esque and dominate America.
[02:02:55.629 --> 02:03:00.691]  But no, instead, the real Abraham Lincoln, I mean, one that you could actually believe in, is Donald Trump.
[02:03:00.751 --> 02:03:06.313]  I mean, he's really trying to unify the country against an outside foreign threat, not just to break away states that weren't happy with what was happening.
[02:03:06.673 --> 02:03:08.914]  And he's really battling for the heart and soul of the nation.
[02:03:09.955 --> 02:03:10.835]  And he is a Yankee.
[02:03:11.695 --> 02:03:13.016]  And he's got the South's support.
[02:03:15.540 --> 02:03:16.501]  And the Midwest support.
[02:03:16.581 --> 02:03:20.843]  And so the East and West Coast have declared war on him.
[02:03:22.184 --> 02:03:24.606]  And I kept saying, the Chi-Coms are running a civil war.
[02:03:25.186 --> 02:03:26.447]  They're running a breakup of the country.
[02:03:26.487 --> 02:03:27.868]  They're wargaming it through the media.
[02:03:27.888 --> 02:03:28.548]  They're financing.
[02:03:28.588 --> 02:03:29.869]  They own almost all of Hollywood.
[02:03:30.469 --> 02:03:31.330]  And people say, really?
[02:03:31.370 --> 02:03:32.971]  The Chi-Coms are fighting a civil war?
[02:03:33.031 --> 02:03:33.832]  Well, you're here now.
[02:03:34.492 --> 02:03:40.556]  The governors, the big tech companies, the blue cities, the 40 million illegal aliens they control,
[02:03:43.703 --> 02:03:59.117]  CHICOM funded, and now I've talked to a lot of national talk show hosts, some of the biggest, the biggest, and they're like, man, we're now getting the threats, or you're getting the threats, but my phone's been ringing off the hook.
[02:04:00.298 --> 02:04:06.944]  And people are showing up in like, you know, dudes in like vans, it'll just say something really threatening to their wife.
[02:04:08.405 --> 02:04:12.668]  And then, you know, somebody will call their house and, you know, say, I saw your little dog in the back there.
[02:04:13.009 --> 02:04:15.951]  They're like, yeah, little spotted dog, we're going to cut your head off.
[02:04:16.711 --> 02:04:18.373]  I mean, that's what's been going on, folks.
[02:04:18.633 --> 02:04:21.275]  And a lot of people just go, whoa, I'm out.
[02:04:21.855 --> 02:04:24.377]  Listen, they're going to cut the whole country's head off and our freedom.
[02:04:24.417 --> 02:04:24.978]  You give in to this.
[02:04:25.518 --> 02:04:27.480]  You can't give in to this intimidation.
[02:04:27.520 --> 02:04:29.241]  They're doing this because they're losing.
[02:04:30.402 --> 02:04:33.784]  But that's why I called for Trump, like Lincoln,
[02:04:34.724 --> 02:04:39.749]  But Lincoln facing a real threat that wants to destroy the children and the country itself.
[02:04:41.790 --> 02:04:49.978]  To understand we're already under globalist imposed martial law and siege, an economic blockade.
[02:04:50.759 --> 02:04:52.640]  And we're facing a military operation.
[02:04:53.521 --> 02:04:54.963]  He's pointed out this is criminal mutiny.
[02:04:55.973 --> 02:04:57.954]  And they're saying they're going to blockade our shores.
[02:04:58.274 --> 02:04:59.695]  It has to stop, Mr. President.
[02:05:00.275 --> 02:05:04.397]  I understand you thought you could back them down beating Russiagate and beating Ukrainegate and beating all the other stuff.
[02:05:04.437 --> 02:05:05.098]  You can't, sir.
[02:05:05.338 --> 02:05:06.198]  They're not going to stop.
[02:05:06.298 --> 02:05:07.579]  Now, this is their military move.
[02:05:08.119 --> 02:05:11.461]  And so people are all asking me, I had to tell the crew today what was going on behind the scenes.
[02:05:12.542 --> 02:05:14.423]  And I'll be able to talk about it soon on air.
[02:05:16.243 --> 02:05:24.848]  But when I learned they're imminently trying to arrest the leadership of the hardliner resistance movement,
[02:05:25.802 --> 02:05:26.922]  It's going to chill up my spine.
[02:05:28.342 --> 02:05:28.843]  You understand?
[02:05:28.863 --> 02:05:39.624]  They're giving their orders in their deep state, in their partially controlled Justice Department and other areas to move against the American people when they kill Trump.
[02:05:39.764 --> 02:05:41.245]  See, they want the country shut down.
[02:05:41.305 --> 02:05:42.005]  You're in your house.
[02:05:42.045 --> 02:05:42.905]  You don't know what to do.
[02:05:43.365 --> 02:05:48.046]  Your new bosses are Bill Gates and Fauci.
[02:05:48.086 --> 02:05:49.866]  And then Trump has a stroke or Trump dies.
[02:05:50.226 --> 02:05:53.367]  And then, by the way, all these people get arrested or whatever for crimes they've committed.
[02:05:53.727 --> 02:05:55.127]  This is called a hot coup.
[02:05:58.897 --> 02:06:03.118]  So, these criminals love to brag too, like Fauci 2017.
[02:06:03.478 --> 02:06:06.059]  Oh, Trump's gonna get hit with a big bio event.
[02:06:06.099 --> 02:06:07.680]  Watch that, that'll cut him down to size.
[02:06:08.700 --> 02:06:09.820]  Well, Trump didn't know about that clip.
[02:06:09.880 --> 02:06:11.401]  Once he found out about it, he's that close to being fired.
[02:06:11.921 --> 02:06:13.461]  And, you know, Bill Gates is acting friendly.
[02:06:13.762 --> 02:06:15.022]  Trump doesn't understand all that.
[02:06:15.042 --> 02:06:15.962]  He hasn't studied it his whole life.
[02:06:17.303 --> 02:06:18.423]  But Trump gets it now.
[02:06:18.443 --> 02:06:19.963]  That's why the New York Times says Trump's crazy.
[02:06:20.324 --> 02:06:21.724]  He doesn't trust the deep state.
[02:06:21.744 --> 02:06:23.785]  At first, there wasn't a deep state.
[02:06:23.825 --> 02:06:24.905]  Now he doesn't trust them.
[02:06:27.628 --> 02:06:28.729]  So this is it, folks.
[02:06:28.850 --> 02:06:32.013]  This is the battle for the Republic, the New World Order, the whole nine yards.
[02:06:32.254 --> 02:06:39.643]  And the Republican arms of the Justice Department are paralyzed and scared.
[02:06:42.611 --> 02:06:52.036]  And blackmailed, and the Democrat ones work for MS-13, and, you know, the jihadi terrorists and the chi-coms are on the payroll already, so they're all going to prison if we ever get the country back.
[02:06:52.116 --> 02:06:59.881]  So, they're fully committed, like crazed criminals of the most savage type you've ever imagined in your life.
[02:07:00.501 --> 02:07:02.882]  And they'll follow any orders once the takeover is complete.
[02:07:03.102 --> 02:07:04.242]  And they're not going to stop there.
[02:07:04.262 --> 02:07:05.283]  They're going to finish the job.
[02:07:05.543 --> 02:07:07.163]  They're going to bankrupt every one of you.
[02:07:07.183 --> 02:07:08.323]  They're going to break your will.
[02:07:08.624 --> 02:07:13.105]  They're going to come take your sons especially, because we're going into bondage just like in ancient Egypt.
[02:07:13.125 --> 02:07:14.665]  It's all a repeat.
[02:07:16.106 --> 02:07:18.467]  But you know, God is going to send the angel of death.
[02:07:19.087 --> 02:07:20.447]  Not delivered by men, but by God.
[02:07:20.507 --> 02:07:22.108]  I pray for the angel of death.
[02:07:23.268 --> 02:07:24.708]  Nature abhors a vacuum.
[02:07:24.748 --> 02:07:25.809]  God abhors it even more.
[02:07:25.829 --> 02:07:28.810]  Because the God of nature
[02:07:29.847 --> 02:07:33.148]  Establish the universe and its limits, its boundaries, its laws.
[02:07:36.548 --> 02:07:44.169]  So this long, sick rotting of our Republic and our planet is nearing its climactic battle of the gods.
[02:07:44.309 --> 02:07:52.991]  So when I pray for God to send justice, I don't even mean death upon our enemies, but a death to their system, a death to the worship of death.
[02:07:54.251 --> 02:07:59.032]  I want abortion and the murder of children, that horrible practice, to be ceased and put to death.
[02:08:02.540 --> 02:08:05.921]  I look at how folks that serve evil become dead in the eyes.
[02:08:07.361 --> 02:08:08.501]  And how they lose their soul.
[02:08:09.842 --> 02:08:11.402]  They lose their connection to the universe.
[02:08:12.102 --> 02:08:13.182]  It's a fate worse than death.
[02:08:15.443 --> 02:08:17.563]  And so, someone's got to call them on their plan.
[02:08:17.883 --> 02:08:20.224]  Paul Watson's about to take over, then the war room's coming up.
[02:08:23.625 --> 02:08:25.405]  I just have to tell you, this is a spiritual battle.
[02:08:27.905 --> 02:08:32.968]  And America is now in a civil war, officially.
[02:08:33.749 --> 02:08:39.313]  When governors from... Guys, pull up a map of the Democrat-Governor alliances.
[02:08:40.013 --> 02:08:40.333]  What is it?
[02:08:40.453 --> 02:08:45.216]  Four states on the West Coast.
[02:08:49.039 --> 02:08:53.402]  And it's a bunch of states on the East Coast, and they just announced
[02:08:54.574 --> 02:08:55.255]  A blockade!
[02:08:55.855 --> 02:08:57.497]  And Trump says, well, I'm gonna stop it.
[02:08:57.537 --> 02:08:59.499]  Oh, we'll control the ports, so the Chinese.
[02:09:00.139 --> 02:09:02.962]  I mean, I have the articles right here that are so surreal.
[02:09:04.183 --> 02:09:10.909]  It's like reading about the start of the Civil War in the early 1860s and blockades and all this, and it's just right there.
[02:09:12.911 --> 02:09:19.177]  But because people haven't lived through this before,
[02:09:26.383 --> 02:09:27.524]  They don't know what they're facing.
[02:09:29.866 --> 02:09:32.869]  Tell Democrat governors that Mutiny on the Bounty was one of my all-time favorite movies.
[02:09:32.929 --> 02:09:39.996]  A good old-fashioned mutiny every now and then is an exciting and invigorating thing to watch, especially when the mutineers need so much from the captain.
[02:09:43.260 --> 02:09:49.427]  My administration is committed to protecting the homeland from the scourge of narco-terrorists and traffickers seeking to stabilize the United States and our hemisphere.
[02:09:49.467 --> 02:09:54.453]  Our military deployments in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific will ensure these threats are neutralized.
[02:09:55.174 --> 02:10:03.104]  And yeah, Trump can nationalize those ports like that and take them back from Cuomo and the governor out in California.
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:07.544]  But think about them saying that and doing that, how crazy that is.
[02:10:07.564 --> 02:10:14.173]  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo says he would refuse to challenge any order from Trump to reopen New York's economy if it puts residents' health at risk.
[02:10:14.253 --> 02:10:16.036]  And Fauci said one death's too many.
[02:10:17.098 --> 02:10:19.621]  And they test everybody that has the common cold and say it's COVID-19.
[02:10:21.696 --> 02:10:23.558]  States unite on reopening economies.
[02:10:24.639 --> 02:10:26.941]  Science, not politics, will guide our decisions.
[02:10:27.402 --> 02:10:28.943]  That means the sign of a dictatorship will tell us.
[02:10:29.284 --> 02:10:29.924]  Not the president.
[02:10:30.405 --> 02:10:34.288]  Governor's coronavirus pact could thwart Trump's goal of reopening the country.
[02:10:34.328 --> 02:10:34.869]  Politico.
[02:10:35.790 --> 02:10:38.633]  Democrats holding COVID-19 bill hostage over unrelated demands.
[02:10:39.824 --> 02:10:41.085]  We're being held hostage.
[02:10:41.425 --> 02:10:42.546]  We're under siege.
[02:10:42.606 --> 02:10:43.927]  We're under blockade.
[02:10:44.688 --> 02:10:45.428]  I've got articles here.
[02:10:45.448 --> 02:10:47.009]  Just type it in because I couldn't find it in my stack.
[02:10:47.029 --> 02:10:47.510]  I had it earlier.
[02:10:47.970 --> 02:10:52.613]  Democrats threaten to close ports, block shipments into the U.S.
[02:10:52.633 --> 02:10:55.896]  I mean, that's an actual headline.
[02:10:57.317 --> 02:10:57.917]  Here, I'll find it.
[02:10:58.838 --> 02:11:05.503]  I mean, this is getting crazier and crazier and crazier by the minute.
[02:11:07.796 --> 02:11:23.004]  Watson's going to take over, but just remember in this critical historic time, your word of mouth and however you can get people to tune in to InfoWars.com, Porn Slash Show, or Banned.Video, however you share that, however you get that information out, or however you transcribably say it, and share it, and take my name off it, I don't care.
[02:11:23.064 --> 02:11:24.385]  Just get it out there.
[02:11:24.845 --> 02:11:29.168]  Get it past the censors and be the Paul Revere's you are, no matter what color you are, where you came from.
[02:11:29.488 --> 02:11:31.449]  If you see what's happening, you understand how dangerous it is.
[02:11:32.748 --> 02:11:35.089]  Then get the word out because this is the globalist revolution.
[02:11:35.129 --> 02:11:35.830]  They prepared us.
[02:11:35.850 --> 02:11:36.490]  They got us ready.
[02:11:36.730 --> 02:11:37.471]  They beta tested.
[02:11:37.511 --> 02:11:41.013]  Now they're launching on every single front.
[02:11:42.974 --> 02:11:45.336]  And we just can't let this continue.
[02:11:45.376 --> 02:11:47.257]  We just can't roll over to this.
[02:11:47.297 --> 02:11:48.918]  We cannot bow to this.
[02:11:48.958 --> 02:11:53.481]  We cannot let the home of the free, land of the free, home of the brave turn into this.
[02:11:54.494 --> 02:11:54.754]  I mean, I...
[02:12:15.772 --> 02:12:34.424]  Everybody is wondering when everything is going to reopen, if life indeed will ever get back to normal, if indeed there will be anything left to reopen after the absolute damage that's been done to the economy and will continue to be done to the economy over the next two, three, four years going forward.
[02:12:34.484 --> 02:12:36.065]  The World Health Organization
[02:12:37.003 --> 02:13:01.100]  The same organisation that helped China cover up the outbreak of coronavirus from the very beginning, that amplified fake news Chinese propaganda via Twitter, which allowed it, that there was no human-to-human transmission of coronavirus back on January 14th, that told countries not to lock down their borders, that told countries not to profile Chinese people because that might be racist and hurt their feelings.
[02:13:01.781 --> 02:13:04.723]  That organisation is now saying that
[02:13:05.413 --> 02:13:15.095]  Things will never get back to normal until Americans, until Brits, until everybody affected by this accepts the new norm.
[02:13:15.635 --> 02:13:22.436]  And in their own words, accepts being educated or re-educated on exactly what that new norm is.
[02:13:23.396 --> 02:13:26.557]  Could it be a government app on your phone, which is mandatory?
[02:13:27.017 --> 02:13:28.537]  Could it be a government vaccine?
[02:13:28.677 --> 02:13:31.258]  Could it indeed be a government microchip?
[02:13:31.438 --> 02:13:33.338]  What exactly is the new norm?
[02:13:34.088 --> 02:13:36.850]  And will the old norm ever be put back in place?
[02:13:36.911 --> 02:13:43.116]  I'm going to go through some articles over the past week, because there's literally been probably about two dozen.
[02:13:43.156 --> 02:13:44.857]  I've written about half of them myself.
[02:13:45.778 --> 02:13:58.609]  The kind of increasingly draconian enforcement measures that police, mainly in the United Kingdom, also across Europe and Australia too, have been imposing as a result of this coronavirus lockdown.
[02:13:59.170 --> 02:14:01.532]  Let's bear in mind that the polls show here in the UK
[02:14:02.563 --> 02:14:08.548]  The vast majority of people still support the coronavirus lockdown, the quarantine, the entire thing.
[02:14:08.988 --> 02:14:21.038]  Now people have been psychologically prepared from bits and pieces that have come out that that's all going to end at the end of this month or the start of May and that everything is gradually going to get back to normal.
[02:14:21.639 --> 02:14:22.580]  Doesn't look like it.
[02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:31.347]  And now Ron Paul over in the US is warning about a health care Patriot Act and that appears to be what we're about to be dealing with because
[02:14:32.088 --> 02:14:33.189]  This is going to come back.
[02:14:33.229 --> 02:14:43.594]  This is going to be a rolling thing where on the proviso of any threat, any perceived threat from any virus, they can bring these measures which have already been established back in on a whim.
[02:14:44.074 --> 02:14:46.715]  And just to see some of the effects of this in the UK.
[02:14:47.676 --> 02:14:49.236]  I mean let's start from last week.
[02:14:49.817 --> 02:14:57.080]  They're literally inspecting people's shopping baskets to check if they've made purchases which are deemed essential.
[02:14:57.460 --> 02:14:59.201]  Now that's not even in the law.
[02:14:59.221 --> 02:15:00.602]  Bear in mind
[02:15:01.317 --> 02:15:03.678]  The only stores that are open are selling food.
[02:15:03.838 --> 02:15:06.100]  Those stores are deemed essential.
[02:15:06.820 --> 02:15:11.003]  So, by proxy, everything being sold in those stores is essential.
[02:15:11.483 --> 02:15:18.687]  Now, I know in Spain and places like that, they actually... My parents, because they're obviously on lockdown, they're in their 60s.
[02:15:18.787 --> 02:15:20.028]  If anyone's at risk, it's them.
[02:15:20.488 --> 02:15:23.810]  They wanted to paint their house while they couldn't leave it.
[02:15:24.450 --> 02:15:27.872]  So they went to the supermarket, which sells food, and it sells paint.
[02:15:28.272 --> 02:15:29.453]  They roped off the paint.
[02:15:30.029 --> 02:15:31.569]  Can't buy paint for some reason.
[02:15:32.389 --> 02:15:34.530]  In the UK, I don't think that's the case from what I've seen.
[02:15:35.510 --> 02:15:40.891]  But the police, and bear in mind, the government had to come out and say, no, you don't even know the law.
[02:15:41.171 --> 02:15:48.433]  It's not in the law that you can set up roadblocks and patrol supermarket aisles to check what people are buying.
[02:15:48.813 --> 02:15:50.633]  But that's happening across the country.
[02:15:50.673 --> 02:15:56.694]  And these stories are only getting increasing in density over the past couple of weeks.
[02:15:56.774 --> 02:15:59.755]  I mean, I've written about 12 stories about this over the past couple of weeks.
[02:16:00.450 --> 02:16:07.332]  One from last week headlines, Second UK police force threatens to check if public are making non-essential purposes.
[02:16:08.232 --> 02:16:21.276]  This is Cambridge Police, just north of London, who tweeted they were monitoring non-essential supermarket aisles in a branch of Tesco, which is a supermarket, to make sure people weren't purchasing frivolous items.
[02:16:21.316 --> 02:16:25.498]  And again, they got the law completely wrong, but again, it was the threat.
[02:16:25.558 --> 02:16:29.499]  Despite the fact that the vast majority of people have been completely obedient
[02:16:29.932 --> 02:16:31.793]  They're following these quarantine rules.
[02:16:32.713 --> 02:16:39.656]  They're now saying they may set up roadblocks to stop people from buying what they deem non-essential items.
[02:16:40.256 --> 02:16:42.477]  Another story from yesterday.
[02:16:42.577 --> 02:16:46.739]  Police fine UK shopper for buying wine during coronavirus lockdown.
[02:16:46.779 --> 02:16:51.521]  Again, they're tracking people as they come out of the supermarket and checking what they've bought.
[02:16:52.021 --> 02:16:53.962]  And these are just the stories that have come out.
[02:16:55.002 --> 02:16:57.343]  These are just the tweets that people have picked up.
[02:16:57.923 --> 02:16:59.624]  This is going on across the country.
[02:17:01.249 --> 02:17:03.310]  And we're not even finding out about most cases.
[02:17:03.330 --> 02:17:04.951]  This happened in Edinburgh, Scotland.
[02:17:04.971 --> 02:17:06.612]  Last weekend, somebody tweeted,
[02:17:20.856 --> 02:17:30.181]  On my way back from Morrison's, the supermarket, two officers asked to look inside my bag and then fined me for only having snacks and a bottle of wine.
[02:17:30.581 --> 02:17:35.644]  So they're going to determine what's a non-essential item despite, again, the fact that that's not even in the law.
[02:17:35.944 --> 02:17:37.805]  The police don't even know the law.
[02:17:37.825 --> 02:17:44.288]  And in fact, added to this article, there's probably about eight other individual cases of similar
[02:17:44.853 --> 02:17:45.413]  Incidents.
[02:17:45.633 --> 02:17:54.657]  Another person in West Lothian tweeted to report a nurse in uniform being fined after leaving a patient's house and someone who left a shop after purchasing a bottle of wine.
[02:17:55.037 --> 02:17:55.857]  Both were fined £30.
[02:17:55.897 --> 02:18:02.720]  Another man reported that his friend's daughter had also been fined £30 for buying wine and snacks.
[02:18:03.460 --> 02:18:08.462]  Another London resident claimed he had been fined simply for taking his dog for a walk late at night.
[02:18:08.962 --> 02:18:12.524]  Which again, is perfectly within their rules.
[02:18:13.564 --> 02:18:17.287]  Now, bear in mind, they may get even more stringent if people misbehave more.
[02:18:18.527 --> 02:18:24.151]  They literally said, when they made the announcement, you can exercise and take your dog for a walk.
[02:18:24.552 --> 02:18:31.356]  Now we've got some arbitrary curfew where the police can decide, no, you can't walk your dog after 8pm or whatever.
[02:18:32.297 --> 02:18:38.141]  A woman who had finished walking her dog and was about to buy groceries for a 74-year-old mother was also fined.
[02:18:38.662 --> 02:18:40.183]  So again, it's all arbitrary.
[02:18:40.403 --> 02:18:42.044]  They have no idea what they're doing.
[02:18:43.359 --> 02:18:45.079]  We had this one from yesterday too.
[02:18:46.060 --> 02:18:50.681]  UK police force brags about hiding in the shadows to catch picnic goers.
[02:18:51.101 --> 02:19:01.983]  They literally put out a tweet saying, watch out, we're going to be monitoring remote countryside rural locations for people having picnics with their family.
[02:19:02.003 --> 02:19:05.664]  Like, how is that even going to impact social distancing?
[02:19:05.704 --> 02:19:10.545]  You're in a field somewhere in the middle of frigging nowhere, having a picnic with your family.
[02:19:11.437 --> 02:19:14.519]  And the police are hiding in the bushes waiting to catch you.
[02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:21.243]  Bedfordshire Police tweeted out an ominous message that sounds like it could have been ripped straight from the pages of Orwell's 1984.
[02:19:21.623 --> 02:19:29.708]  If you think that by going for a picnic in a rural location, no one will find you, don't be surprised if an officer appears from the shadows.
[02:19:29.748 --> 02:19:31.470]  We are covering the whole county.
[02:19:32.450 --> 02:19:36.933]  In fact, there's a meme, which I retweeted, I think, or liked earlier.
[02:19:37.881 --> 02:19:48.167]  And it says grooming gangs with a stationary police car, and then it says something like buying non-essential items with the police car zooming to the location to arrest the dissident.
[02:19:48.187 --> 02:19:58.493]  And again, it's different to countries like Spain and Italy, because their police forces have a reputation of being more fearsome, more jacked.
[02:19:59.274 --> 02:20:07.559]  The reputation of the police in the United Kingdom, thanks to decades of them being figuratively castrated by laws which favoured criminals,
[02:20:08.012 --> 02:20:18.896]  Is Benny Hill, where they're literally chasing around mental deranged patients on the streets trying to catch them, falling over, rolling over because they're all overweight.
[02:20:19.236 --> 02:20:20.076]  It's ridiculous.
[02:20:20.736 --> 02:20:23.257]  People don't respect the police and that's a different problem.
[02:20:23.697 --> 02:20:30.480]  But now they're getting their revenge apparently by hiding in the bushes for families having picnics in rural locations.
[02:20:31.360 --> 02:20:34.041]  Again, the whole idea of this lockdown
[02:20:35.209 --> 02:20:38.750]  By their own rhetoric, it can only work with the consent of the governed.
[02:20:39.650 --> 02:20:49.992]  If people stop respecting the police, because they're enforcing it in these petty, arbitrary, draconian ways, then everyone's not going to respect it, and it's going to be a complete failure.
[02:20:50.012 --> 02:20:51.012]  There's going to be no point.
[02:20:52.612 --> 02:20:57.333]  Another story, UK police break into a man's house to check he's not having a social gathering.
[02:20:58.253 --> 02:21:04.334]  Again, people said, when I posted this video, they started, oh, but he was being mean to them, he swore at them.
[02:21:05.069 --> 02:21:12.154]  Yeah, does that give them the right to smash down his door because they think he might be having a party when there's nobody in the house?
[02:21:12.594 --> 02:21:16.477]  No warrant, they just smash down his door and search the house.
[02:21:18.178 --> 02:21:22.922]  Is that going to increase if these lockdown measures aren't put under control?
[02:21:22.942 --> 02:21:28.326]  Another article, COVID-19 police threatened neighbour who cut disabled man's lawn.
[02:21:28.406 --> 02:21:30.247]  It goes on and on and on.
[02:21:30.856 --> 02:21:46.939]  In Australia, they're using a surveillance helicopter, normally used to rescue people in remote locations, to track down people who are camping, like a husband and wife team who went camping on the Easter weekend, and apparently that's going to defeat coronavirus.
[02:21:47.339 --> 02:21:51.440]  Meanwhile, in London, flights are coming in from Wuhan, China!
[02:21:51.880 --> 02:21:54.921]  But you might get arrested for having a picnic in a field.
[02:21:55.041 --> 02:21:56.361]  Don't go away, we'll be back.
[02:21:57.389 --> 02:22:02.718]  We're live and I was getting into this article before the break on the subject of the UK lockdown.
[02:22:03.499 --> 02:22:07.185]  This is an article out of able2uk.com.
[02:22:07.265 --> 02:22:09.689]  Police threaten neighbour who cut disabled man's lawn.
[02:22:10.330 --> 02:22:12.190]  And it's Derbyshire Police once again.
[02:22:12.370 --> 02:22:25.993]  It's the same police force that used a surveillance drone to publicly shame people who walked their dogs, God forbid, in remote locations in fields in the Peak District, where obviously millions of people congregate, don't they?
[02:22:26.053 --> 02:22:27.153]  No, literally nobody does.
[02:22:28.013 --> 02:22:33.774]  And then they put it on Twitter and bragged about it and said, look, we tracked down their addresses via their number plates.
[02:22:34.574 --> 02:22:39.055]  This is the same police force who dyed a blue lagoon black
[02:22:39.676 --> 02:22:41.257]  to prevent people from gathering there.
[02:22:41.817 --> 02:22:55.184]  So all their most invasive enforcement measures are in places where social distancing naturally exists anyway and it's completely unnecessary, over-the-top, draconian, out-of-control to do this kind of thing.
[02:22:55.204 --> 02:22:56.444]  And here we have another example.
[02:22:57.485 --> 02:23:01.947]  Derbyshire police have used threatening behavior to a neighbor who cut the grass for a disabled man.
[02:23:02.547 --> 02:23:02.807]  Again.
[02:23:04.008 --> 02:23:07.710]  These areas all have massive problems with
[02:23:08.436 --> 02:23:09.557]  Islamic grooming gangs.
[02:23:09.637 --> 02:23:10.417]  Nothing was done.
[02:23:10.477 --> 02:23:14.400]  The people blowing the whistle on the Islamic grooming gangs were often targeted by the police.
[02:23:14.760 --> 02:23:20.444]  But if you cut the grass for your disabled neighbour, they're going to bang on your door within hours.
[02:23:21.124 --> 02:23:30.250]  Adrian Rimmington from Chesterfield received a visit from a friend who lives next door to him, offering to help with the kind deed on March 31st, a week after the lockdown was put in force.
[02:23:30.950 --> 02:23:33.392]  Rimmington, 63 years old, told the Derbyshire Times,
[02:23:38.567 --> 02:23:44.272]  One said, we've had a report from someone that your gardener entered your house in order to plug in your lawnmower.
[02:23:44.552 --> 02:23:45.392]  God forbid!
[02:23:46.253 --> 02:23:49.315]  Adrian corrected the officers, telling them my friend never entered the house.
[02:23:49.836 --> 02:23:52.138]  I opened the window, my friend reached in with a lawnmower plug.
[02:23:53.258 --> 02:24:00.364]  Despite being explained the situation, the police went to the neighbor's house, issued them a warning and threatened the Good Samaritan with a fine if it happened again.
[02:24:01.084 --> 02:24:03.046]  And you know that all this is being done.
[02:24:04.104 --> 02:24:09.686]  Through neighbours snitching on other neighbours because of all their little petty resentments over the years.
[02:24:09.726 --> 02:24:13.627]  You know, maybe they've had a couple of house parties that were too loud or something.
[02:24:14.207 --> 02:24:21.450]  Can't really snitch on them for that, but now it's free reign and the Karens of the world get to empower themselves.
[02:24:22.062 --> 02:24:27.748]  With the power of something similar to what the Stasi had back in East Germany.
[02:24:28.188 --> 02:24:33.554]  Now obviously I'm not saying it's anywhere near that bad yet, but it's the same kind of mentality.
[02:24:33.754 --> 02:24:35.316]  This tattletale society.
[02:24:36.257 --> 02:24:37.138]  Another example.
[02:24:38.259 --> 02:24:38.700]  Video.
[02:24:38.800 --> 02:24:43.665]  Journalist gets home visit from UK police after he reported mosques flouting lockdown law.
[02:24:44.485 --> 02:24:57.795]  This was a radio host who filed a complaint with West Yorkshire police after he saw reports in local media that Muslims in Bradford and Leeds were gathering at mosques for Friday prayers in violation of Covid-19 isolation rules.
[02:24:58.175 --> 02:25:01.017]  Which by the way is happening across the Muslim world.
[02:25:01.337 --> 02:25:07.662]  In Egypt they literally had a giant march down the street protesting against coronavirus.
[02:25:08.663 --> 02:25:11.185]  Literally demonstrating against a viral infection.
[02:25:12.005 --> 02:25:12.906]  In Pakistan
[02:25:13.649 --> 02:25:16.131]  The health authorities there tried to shut down a mosque.
[02:25:16.171 --> 02:25:17.011]  That was the law.
[02:25:17.071 --> 02:25:19.073]  They tried to shut it down under quarantine rules.
[02:25:19.553 --> 02:25:22.435]  A giant mob of a thousand people chased them away.
[02:25:22.796 --> 02:25:24.617]  We had that article a couple of weeks ago.
[02:25:25.057 --> 02:25:27.799]  In India, the same thing happened a couple of days ago.
[02:25:28.300 --> 02:25:35.665]  There's the one out of India, which is up on Summit.News today, where again, they found a local imam
[02:25:36.434 --> 02:25:40.517]  who was thought to have been infected with coronavirus along with about two dozen other people.
[02:25:40.977 --> 02:25:52.585]  They tried to go and talk to them about quarantining themselves and then 300 screaming Muslim worshippers came running out onto the street and chased the authorities away.
[02:25:53.085 --> 02:25:54.786]  But again, it's not just in Pakistan.
[02:25:54.866 --> 02:25:55.927]  It's not just in India.
[02:25:56.007 --> 02:25:57.668]  It's in Berlin, Germany.
[02:25:58.468 --> 02:26:02.191]  And I had the footage in my video from last week.
[02:26:02.731 --> 02:26:05.173]  We're outside one of the biggest mosques in Berlin.
[02:26:05.942 --> 02:26:23.114]  Not only crowds of people around the mosques engaging in worship, not social distancing as the Islamic call to prayer rings out, the streets were all crammed with people and then at the end of the prayer they all got in their cars and drove home, even though the mosque was supposed to be closed.
[02:26:23.434 --> 02:26:28.837]  Again, these measures aren't being enforced on certain demographics across Europe.
[02:26:29.438 --> 02:26:34.061]  So this radio host in the UK saw reports about that in local media
[02:26:35.143 --> 02:26:41.026]  made a complaint to police that Muslims at these mosques were violating quarantine rules.
[02:26:41.707 --> 02:26:42.727]  What did the police do?
[02:26:43.067 --> 02:26:44.048]  They visited him!
[02:26:46.229 --> 02:26:51.692]  Similar to how people who report Muslim grooming gangs often get visited and targeted themselves by the authorities.
[02:26:52.252 --> 02:26:57.735]  They visited him, told him that he couldn't drive around, told him that that wasn't an essential journey.
[02:26:58.095 --> 02:27:02.818]  So again, the guy reporting the crime got investigated by the police himself.
[02:27:03.627 --> 02:27:07.788]  That's just a few examples of what's been happening in the UK over the past week.
[02:27:08.328 --> 02:27:27.414]  Again, if these continue to build in severity and intensity, and if these lockdown measures don't end or at least are beginning to be scaled down in the next two, three weeks, the resentment is going to build and people are just going to start flouting the lockdown measures because they're going to see them not being enforced against some groups,
[02:27:28.553 --> 02:27:39.520]  And they're going to see them being overly enforced to a draconian degree against people having picnics, people buying a bottle of wine at the shop, and the police are no longer going to have the public support.
[02:27:40.401 --> 02:27:49.187]  So Downing Street was actually right and correct to come out and say, no, this is not in the law that you can only buy certain items in the supermarket.
[02:27:49.227 --> 02:27:56.572]  But some of these police chiefs are so idiotic and so power mad, they think they can make up the rules as they go along.
[02:27:57.819 --> 02:28:04.282]  Meanwhile, sticking in the UK, NHS hospitals have four times more empty beds than normal.
[02:28:05.223 --> 02:28:17.569]  Tens of thousands of NHS hospital beds remain unoccupied amid the coronavirus crisis, about four times the normal number, due to huge ongoing efforts to free up space and a slowdown in admissions from other causes.
[02:28:18.350 --> 02:28:26.314]  This is one of the problems with what some people may see as over-preparation or over-exaggeration of the dangers of
[02:28:26.857 --> 02:28:43.735]  Coronavirus overwhelming the NHS and healthcare systems because people with other conditions, some of them may turn out to be life-threatening in the longer term, are not going to hospital because they think they will be a burden on hospitals, on nurses and doctors.
[02:28:44.155 --> 02:28:47.298]  Some of those people, unfortunately, are going to die.
[02:28:48.099 --> 02:28:48.720]  So now we've got
[02:28:49.346 --> 02:29:05.350]  Tens of thousands of empty beds, four times more empty beds than normal throughout the United Kingdom, despite the fact that we were told for weeks that this would overwhelm the NHS and the healthcare system, which is why we needed these quarantine lockdown measures in the first place.
[02:29:05.890 --> 02:29:12.112]  Turns out that hasn't happened, and seemingly we have more empty hospital beds than ever before.
[02:29:13.160 --> 02:29:27.405]  Now part of the reason for that is, of course, because they built some of these temporary hospitals in major cities across the country, just as they did in the United States of America, and with things like the ships coming into New York Harbor to take the overspill.
[02:29:28.245 --> 02:29:30.626]  But then we see this headline out, Sky News, coronavirus.
[02:29:31.126 --> 02:29:35.628]  New Washington Nightingale Hospital may never open, says NHS chief.
[02:29:36.357 --> 02:29:43.943]  A new Nightingale hospital being built in Tyne and Weo, which is in the northeast of England, may never need to open, an AHS boss has said.
[02:29:44.284 --> 02:29:53.091]  The 460-bed site in Washington could be ready to take patients at the end of the month, but only if hospitals in the northeast are unable to cope during the coronavirus pandemic.
[02:29:53.892 --> 02:29:57.735]  So it's proven that they have been able to cope, and even
[02:29:59.205 --> 02:30:06.386]  Most of these overspill hospitals that have been built throughout the country are completely empty and not being used.
[02:30:06.446 --> 02:30:21.869]  Again, you could argue that was over-preparation, you could argue that that's partly because people with other health conditions aren't going to hospital, and that may indeed end up being fatal for some of them, or you could argue that the coronavirus pandemic was exaggerated.
[02:30:22.209 --> 02:30:25.790]  Take your pick, but many empty hospital beds in the United Kingdom.
[02:30:26.070 --> 02:30:27.770]  Don't go away, Summit.News will be back.
[02:30:28.590 --> 02:30:39.060]  So NHS hospitals in the United Kingdom have four times more empty beds than normal, than usual times, and bear in mind we're coming out of a normal flu season.
[02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:50.710]  The overspill hospitals that have been built in major cities throughout the country are empty and now Sky News is reporting that one of them in the northeast of England may never open.
[02:30:51.651 --> 02:30:53.173]  Meanwhile if you look at the graphs
[02:30:54.341 --> 02:31:01.282]  Total number of deaths in England and Wales from 2010 to 2020, including up until week 13 of that year, says for 2020 the number of deaths is 150,000 people.
[02:31:01.302 --> 02:31:03.743]  Now if you look at 2018, up until this point in 2018 it was 164,000 people.
[02:31:03.763 --> 02:31:05.143]  2017 it was 153,000 people.
[02:31:05.163 --> 02:31:05.803]  2019 it was slightly below 146,000 people.
[02:31:05.823 --> 02:31:06.184]  2015 it was higher
[02:31:23.557 --> 02:31:24.738]  160,000 people.
[02:31:25.499 --> 02:31:35.106]  So in most of the previous years, over the past five, six years in England and Wales, more people have died up until this point.
[02:31:35.626 --> 02:31:46.054]  Bearing in mind they're treating deaths of people who already had underlying health conditions, many of whom would have probably died anyway, as COVID deaths just because they caught COVID.
[02:31:46.535 --> 02:31:51.419]  So the graph shows that in fact it's an average or below average
[02:31:52.369 --> 02:31:57.571]  First 13 weeks of the year in England and Wales in terms of deaths.
[02:31:58.691 --> 02:32:06.154]  And yet still, headline out of Breitbart, coronavirus Robb expected to announce lockdown will last three more weeks.
[02:32:06.574 --> 02:32:07.054]  Minimum.
[02:32:07.634 --> 02:32:09.155]  They're not even going to address it.
[02:32:09.215 --> 02:32:11.735]  They're not even going to talk about it for another three weeks.
[02:32:12.996 --> 02:32:19.038]  In the UK, Senior Minister Dominic Robb is expected to announce that the coronavirus lockdown will continue for another three weeks.
[02:32:19.574 --> 02:32:22.756]  The First Secretary of State is deputising for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
[02:32:22.776 --> 02:32:29.820]  There's a report to be planning to announce on Thursday that the government-enforced social distancing measures will go on until May 7th.
[02:32:31.021 --> 02:32:36.324]  Bearing in mind Austria, which is one of the countries that closed its border early and took strong measures,
[02:32:37.083 --> 02:32:54.915]  is reopening everything today not everything all at once but starting to reopen businesses today and in fact over the next two weeks will it looks like have reopened everything yet here in the UK we're not we're saying we can't even have a discussion about opening anything for another three weeks.
[02:32:55.656 --> 02:33:02.801]  The War Cabinet of Mr Robb, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak
[02:33:03.812 --> 02:33:14.439]  He's anticipated to agree to the extension on Thursday, according to the Times, with the next review expected by the time the Prime Minister is recovered, which is not likely to be soon.
[02:33:14.459 --> 02:33:22.365]  So again, despite the four times more empty hospital beds than normal, these overspill hospitals across the country
[02:33:23.172 --> 02:33:25.793]  May never open because there's no demand for them.
[02:33:26.193 --> 02:33:42.220]  The number of deaths in the United Kingdom for 2020, or England and Wales for 2020, the first 13 weeks of 2020, are below average compared to previous years, yet we're still not talking about reopening anything for at least three weeks.
[02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:43.900]  Interesting.
[02:33:44.521 --> 02:33:51.523]  Given this headline out of the Financial Times, UK economy faces 35% quarterly plunge if lockdown lasts.
[02:33:52.444 --> 02:33:52.764]  And again,
[02:33:53.874 --> 02:34:01.776]  We know long-term economic decline leads to depression, leads to suicide, leads to poverty, leads to more death.
[02:34:02.816 --> 02:34:13.419]  Will absolutely devastating the economy lead to more deaths than coronavirus would have killed, if you include the people with those pre-existing health conditions that would have died anyway.
[02:34:14.119 --> 02:34:18.520]  The UK economy faces a 35% plunge in output in the second quarter of 2020.
[02:34:19.640 --> 02:34:21.581]  If a lockdown to fight the spread of coronavirus
[02:34:22.011 --> 02:34:25.234]  Remains in place for three months, the country's fiscal watchdog has warned.
[02:34:25.254 --> 02:34:40.445]  It says that in this scenario, government borrowing would rise by $218 billion to $273 billion, taking the deficit to 14% of gross domestic product, the highest since the Second World War, and well above the financial crisis peak of 10%.
[02:34:40.866 --> 02:34:48.512]  The IMF is also warning the world will very likely experience the worst recession since the 1930s.
[02:34:50.675 --> 02:35:03.387]  Given this, given that the hospitals don't seem to be overwhelmed, is it time to start talking about relaxing these lockdown measures way earlier than they're telling us that they're even going to begin to discuss it?
[02:35:03.848 --> 02:35:05.209]  That's going to be a big question.
[02:35:06.130 --> 02:35:14.058]  Meanwhile, also in Britain, Reuters reports Britain's ITV under fire over presenters 5G coronavirus comments.
[02:35:14.713 --> 02:35:26.400]  Britain's biggest free-to-air broadcaster, ITV, came under fire on Tuesday after one of its leading presenters said no one knew whether a conspiracy theory that 5G masks helped spread the novel coronavirus was true or not.
[02:35:27.781 --> 02:35:30.923]  Now this is Eamon Holmes, a veteran presenter on ITV.
[02:35:31.943 --> 02:35:37.547]  The presenter, in fact, of This Morning, which is one of the biggest shows in the entire country.
[02:35:39.085 --> 02:35:50.412]  He said it's very easy to say it's not true because it suits the state narrative and he basically said what I don't accept is mainstream media immediately slapping that down as not true when they don't know that it's not true.
[02:35:51.473 --> 02:35:55.775]  Now to be clear, I don't think that 5G towers are linked to coronavirus.
[02:35:55.795 --> 02:35:59.838]  They may be linked to a number of other health complaints, probably not coronavirus.
[02:36:00.378 --> 02:36:01.259]  What's interesting
[02:36:02.347 --> 02:36:12.049]  Is the very fact that the media is editorializing by saying these ridiculous conspiracy theories about 5G, they're dangerous, we need to shut them down.
[02:36:12.489 --> 02:36:15.929]  Because people don't trust the media to such a great extent.
[02:36:16.389 --> 02:36:23.591]  The fact that the media is putting that in their articles, in their news clips, makes people believe the conspiracy theory more.
[02:36:25.031 --> 02:36:31.752]  For example, Sky News headline, coronavirus attacks on 5G mobile masks surge over Easter weekend.
[02:36:32.415 --> 02:36:39.059]  Attacks on mobile mass surged over the Easter weekend with a further 20 suspected arson cases being reported.
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:40.660]  Then listen.
[02:36:41.661 --> 02:36:51.646]  It says the attacks come as a deeply flawed and scientifically ignorant conspiracy theory is spreading linking the deployment of 5G antennas to the COVID-19 outbreak.
[02:36:51.987 --> 02:36:53.568]  That's not a news report.
[02:36:54.308 --> 02:36:55.829]  That's editorialising.
[02:36:56.529 --> 02:37:00.672]  So because the media, and it's a similar situation in the US, but because the media in the UK
[02:37:01.548 --> 02:37:06.169]  is not a trusted institution, hasn't been a trusted institution for so long.
[02:37:06.969 --> 02:37:15.771]  The fact that they editorialize and say these horrible, dangerous, ignorant conspiracy theories and put that in their articles, there's such little trust for them.
[02:37:16.432 --> 02:37:19.492]  That makes people believe the conspiracy even more.
[02:37:20.633 --> 02:37:30.155]  So the more the media talks about this, the more videos YouTube deletes on this, like they did with the David Icke interview, the more they claim that this is
[02:37:31.084 --> 02:37:31.564]  BS.
[02:37:32.505 --> 02:37:37.988]  The more 5G towers are going to be attacked because people hate the media and don't trust the media.
[02:37:38.748 --> 02:37:42.610]  In fact, I've got this poll up from YouGov.
[02:37:43.091 --> 02:37:44.631]  Do Britons trust the press?
[02:37:44.651 --> 02:37:53.996]  It says less than half of Britons, 44%, now say they trust the institution to tell the truth despite its public charter to remain politically neutral.
[02:37:54.397 --> 02:37:55.637]  Talking about the BBC.
[02:37:56.318 --> 02:38:00.460]  And again, this holds true generally for the other mainstream news channels.
[02:38:01.809 --> 02:38:15.718]  So if the media wants to stop people from attacking 5G towers, probably best to stop reporting on these conspiracy theories about the link between coronavirus and 5G, because they don't trust you.
[02:38:16.278 --> 02:38:24.884]  When you say it's debunked, people then believe it, because you have such little authority remaining, because you've lied about so many other things.
[02:38:25.704 --> 02:38:26.825]  By the way, the reason this
[02:38:28.044 --> 02:38:37.731]  Eamon Holmes guy is talking about it is because he's friends with David Icke, who basically started the conspiracy theory, if you want to call it that, back a few weeks ago.
[02:38:37.791 --> 02:38:46.918]  In fact, there was a broadcast of one of his interviews on London Real, which is another semi-mainstream television channel in the United Kingdom.
[02:38:46.978 --> 02:38:52.422]  That's now being investigated by Ofcom, and there's going to be further punishment for that.
[02:38:52.502 --> 02:38:56.145]  So this story is just going to drag on, and more 5G towers are going to get attacked.
[02:38:57.003 --> 02:39:08.671]  Not because people, not because the conspiracy theory is true, but because the media is so distrusted, and they continue to talk about it, that people believe the opposite.
[02:39:08.771 --> 02:39:10.532]  Very interesting social phenomenon.
[02:39:12.314 --> 02:39:20.059]  Meanwhile, Chinese spokesman that blamed US Army for coronavirus calls WHO objective and just.
[02:39:20.139 --> 02:39:24.322]  I'm going to get into this after the break, because the WHO has come out
[02:39:24.841 --> 02:39:29.925]  with a new list of provisions that need to be in place before life gets back to normal.
[02:39:30.245 --> 02:39:39.112]  But then they say basically life is never going to get back to normal and that people need to be re-educated into the new way of doing things.
[02:39:39.172 --> 02:39:40.553]  What is the new way of doing things?
[02:39:40.593 --> 02:39:47.138]  Well, it could be a government app on your phone which tracks your location to protect other people from coronavirus.
[02:39:47.218 --> 02:39:48.119]  It could be the vaccine.
[02:39:48.179 --> 02:39:49.300]  Is that going to be mandatory?
[02:39:50.658 --> 02:39:52.278]  Is it going to be the chip?
[02:39:52.418 --> 02:39:54.419]  Is that eventually going to be mandatory?
[02:39:54.459 --> 02:39:56.679]  We'll talk about that and other news stories on the other side.
[02:39:57.379 --> 02:39:58.880]  Breaking news at summit.news.
[02:39:58.920 --> 02:39:59.540]  Don't go away.
[02:39:59.820 --> 02:40:00.500]  We'll be right back.
[02:40:00.520 --> 02:40:09.222]  I'm going to get to what the WHO is saying is the new norm and how Americans and everyone across the world will need to adapt to that new norm.
[02:40:09.282 --> 02:40:13.523]  First, I want to tell you about the great products available at infowarsstore.com.

[02:41:15.738 --> 02:41:25.005]  And given that we're not allowed to go outside that much anymore, maybe it's time to stock up on some of that Vitamin D. InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:41:25.065 --> 02:41:27.107]  Please go there and support us today.
[02:41:28.668 --> 02:41:36.714]  Now, the WHO has published a list of six criteria for countries to consider when lifting the lockdown.
[02:41:37.913 --> 02:41:45.676]  Number six is that communities are fully educated and engaged and empowered to adjust to the new norm.
[02:41:45.896 --> 02:41:46.876]  What is the new norm?
[02:41:46.936 --> 02:41:55.500]  Well, CBS Miami reports Florida Surgeon General coronavirus could force residents to continue social distancing for a year.
[02:41:56.460 --> 02:42:01.922]  State's top public health officer said Florida residents could be social distancing and wearing facial coverings for a year.
[02:42:02.628 --> 02:42:07.672]  It says, until we get a vaccine, which is a while off, this is going to be our new normal.
[02:42:07.732 --> 02:42:14.256]  So again, when they talk about opening things up, it isn't really going to happen that quickly from what they're saying.
[02:42:15.397 --> 02:42:25.524]  CNN, a new study from Harvard researchers published today in the journal Science, finds that prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022.
[02:42:26.525 --> 02:42:29.567]  Harvard researchers say under current critical care capacities,
[02:42:30.145 --> 02:42:40.070]  The overall duration of the COVID epidemic could last into 2022, requiring social distancing measures to be in place between 25% and 75% of that time.
[02:42:40.470 --> 02:42:47.953]  So again, it's this whole idea of intermittent and they can just roll it back in at any point they like.
[02:42:48.533 --> 02:42:54.436]  Do you think that may be exploited for political purposes, especially as we come up to a presidential election?
[02:42:54.796 --> 02:42:56.157]  Yes, I think it probably will.
[02:42:57.205 --> 02:43:07.650]  Meanwhile, Breitbart reports unfathomable Australia hits WHO support for China wet markets and coronavirus epicenter.
[02:43:08.090 --> 02:43:13.073]  The WHO has literally come out and said that it supports keeping these wet markets open.
[02:43:13.493 --> 02:43:16.074]  Now if you believe it came from the wet market,
[02:43:16.778 --> 02:43:17.619]  Then fair enough.
[02:43:18.079 --> 02:43:34.555]  It's interesting, isn't it, how they've made this narrative that if you say it came from the wet market, if you say these disgusting places, unhygienic, dangerous places need to be closed down, if you say that eating bats is disgusting, you're called racist, you're called a bigot,
[02:43:35.868 --> 02:43:38.429]  But then if you say, oh, OK, then leave that.
[02:43:38.549 --> 02:43:51.417]  Let's say it came from a certain lab located in Wuhan, given that the bat that this coronavirus supposedly came from was the horseshoe bat, which they say was never even sold in the Wuhan meat market.
[02:43:51.777 --> 02:43:54.638]  No, you can't say that either, because that's a dangerous conspiracy theory.
[02:43:55.359 --> 02:43:57.900]  You can't talk about it from wherever it came.
[02:43:57.960 --> 02:43:58.580]  Just shut up.
[02:43:58.680 --> 02:43:59.441]  Don't say anything.
[02:43:59.541 --> 02:44:01.282]  OK, well, Australia now.
[02:44:02.691 --> 02:44:08.853]  has confronted the World Health Organization, which helped China cover up the outbreak of coronavirus for months on end.
[02:44:09.553 --> 02:44:12.854]  But they're the authority that we all need to bow down to, don't question them.
[02:44:14.035 --> 02:44:21.777]  Australia confronted them on Tuesday over claims it supports the so-called wet markets reopening in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the source of the global coronavirus outbreak.
[02:44:22.297 --> 02:44:31.680]  Prime Minister Scott Morrison demanded answers about the markets, saying it was unfathomable for the WHO to back live animal markets at a time when the Chinese coronavirus pandemic is
[02:44:32.307 --> 02:44:33.147]  Sweeping the world.
[02:44:33.627 --> 02:44:49.752]  So they've literally come out and said, yep, you can continue running these wet markets despite the actual state of them, with literal rats crawling all over everything, people eating diseased bats which cause global pandemics, but you can open them up again.
[02:44:49.932 --> 02:44:55.154]  Americans though, they'll still be locked inside their houses as the flights literally land from Wuhan, China.
[02:44:56.434 --> 02:44:59.035]  Meanwhile, Fox News reports
[02:44:59.548 --> 02:45:03.810]  Coronavirus stay-at-home orders stir protest nationwide amid fears of economic collapse.
[02:45:04.430 --> 02:45:15.275]  We're now starting to see, and I saw one of these in Toronto, very, very small, but there's one in Michigan a couple of days ago, protests against this lockdown.
[02:45:15.635 --> 02:45:27.841]  At least 15,000 cars and trucks are expected to descend on Michigan's state capital on Wednesday to protest what they're calling Governor Gretchen Whitmer's tyrannical new guidelines to slow the spread of the coronavirus in the state.
[02:45:28.843 --> 02:45:49.732]  The so-called drive-by demonstration in order to maintain social distancing aims to bring traffic to a gridlock and protest the stay-at-home, stay-safe executive order by Whitmer, a Democrat, mandating what businesses could stay home, what some businesses could sell, and ordering people in her state against any gatherings, no matter the size or family ties.
[02:45:50.856 --> 02:45:58.061]  One of the organizers said, quote, quarantine is when you restrict movement of sick people, tyranny is when you restrict the movement of healthy people.
[02:45:58.101 --> 02:45:59.362]  So we're going to see more of this.
[02:45:59.823 --> 02:46:07.528]  And again, if they lose the consent of the governed to be obedient to these lockdown measures, then nobody's going to obey them.
[02:46:08.689 --> 02:46:19.757]  So if you keep pushing this tyrannical, draconian measure, and individually targeting people for having picnics, or for buying bottles of wine, then the rest of the population
[02:46:20.427 --> 02:46:21.588]  is going to lose your trust.
[02:46:22.869 --> 02:46:49.089]  Frybar reports Chinese spokesman that blamed US Army for coronavirus calls WHO objective and just again the circle jerk between the WHO and China continues which is no surprise given that they helped each other cover it up given that the leader of the WHO is basically a Chinese puppet who was once a member of a violent revolutionary communist party in Ethiopia that literally denied health treatment to certain ethnic groups
[02:46:50.188 --> 02:46:53.490]  No surprise that those two are still joined at the hip.
[02:46:54.850 --> 02:47:01.673]  Meanwhile, National File reports China restricts research into COVID-19 origin as coronavirus cases reappear.
[02:47:02.234 --> 02:47:08.377]  So they're covering it up yet again, as the world has begun to point the finger at China over the origin of COVID-19.
[02:47:09.197 --> 02:47:15.260]  Beijing has announced tightening restrictions over academic publications addressing the origin of the current global pandemic.
[02:47:16.260 --> 02:47:17.681]  And again, one of those academic
[02:47:18.965 --> 02:47:26.288]  Publications that came out of China pointing the finger at the Wuhan laboratory was deleted by the Chinese authorities as well.
[02:47:26.348 --> 02:47:29.449]  And now they're saying they're going to do more of that going forward.
[02:47:29.710 --> 02:47:31.650]  But don't worry, you can trust them.
[02:47:31.970 --> 02:47:36.632]  And the WHO says that you can trust them and says that they've got coronavirus under control.
[02:47:36.772 --> 02:47:37.113]  Okay.
[02:47:38.493 --> 02:47:42.435]  Emmanuel Macron extends French coronavirus lockdown until May 11th.
[02:47:43.615 --> 02:47:47.357]  He's announced the emergency measures to send spread of Wuhan virus will be kept in place.
[02:47:48.092 --> 02:47:52.434]  for an additional month while admitting the government was not prepared for the pandemic.
[02:47:53.434 --> 02:48:12.162]  Those measures aren't in place in some areas of France and as we reported a couple of weeks ago in the migrant ghettos of Paris, French officials even suggested just letting them keep all the shops open and go about their business as normal because some cultures are evidently better than others.
[02:48:12.202 --> 02:48:13.483]  The reality of course is that
[02:48:14.045 --> 02:48:30.057]  Those people don't obey lockdown measures because they have a streak of criminality in many areas of those sensitive regions, and so it's easier to just let them do what they want, because in the words of this French official, he wanted to prevent riots.
[02:48:31.218 --> 02:48:42.727]  So you have to stay home, you have to have the police check your shopping basket, you have to have the police knock on your door if your family's out in the front garden, if you're mowing the lawn for your disabled neighbour,
[02:48:43.447 --> 02:48:46.289]  But in certain areas, they don't even go near them.
[02:48:47.310 --> 02:48:50.732]  India, huge crowd stops Islamic cleric from being quarantined.
[02:48:51.172 --> 02:48:55.075]  Talked about this earlier video footage shows a huge crowd of Muslims in India flooding the street.
[02:48:55.936 --> 02:48:59.738]  And by the way, before this incident even began, they were all just milling around as normal.
[02:49:02.480 --> 02:49:03.741]  It's just a complete joke.
[02:49:04.242 --> 02:49:08.765]  There's literally no social distancing in that country, at least out of these videos here.
[02:49:10.387 --> 02:49:15.408]  Report Turkey plans to send fresh wave of corona infected migrants to Europe of course.
[02:49:16.488 --> 02:49:19.989]  We're constantly told that mass migration is cultural enrichment.
[02:49:20.529 --> 02:49:35.271]  Meanwhile the European Union literally had to pay Turkey and its dictator leader six billion euros to stop migrants coming into Europe because they're such a helpful form of cultural enrichment.
[02:49:35.291 --> 02:49:38.992]  You have to literally pay six billion in blackmail money to stop them from coming.
[02:49:39.847 --> 02:49:51.415]  But now the Turkish leader wants more concessions and Voice of America reports that Erdogan is planning to send a fresh wave of migrants to Europe with officials fearing many of them will be infected with coronavirus.
[02:49:52.116 --> 02:50:01.622]  So the Greek Air Force Navy have stepped up patrols against what they see as another organised effort to unleash thousands of migrants as a political weapon.
[02:50:01.663 --> 02:50:04.925]  Again, you pay six billion euros to keep them away
[02:50:05.543 --> 02:50:14.488]  The Turkish dictator continues to use them as a political weapon, yet culturally we're told continually that they're so very enriching.
[02:50:14.568 --> 02:50:16.209]  Doesn't really seem to be the case, does it?
[02:50:16.229 --> 02:50:17.689]  That's going to wrap it up for now.
[02:50:17.729 --> 02:50:19.830]  Coming up next is War Room with Owen Schroyer.
[02:50:20.251 --> 02:50:21.471]  Breaking news at summit.news.

[02:50:42.628 --> 02:50:45.290]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[02:50:45.910 --> 02:50:48.792]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[02:50:49.452 --> 02:50:51.113]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[02:50:51.693 --> 02:50:53.153]  I suggest BAN.VIDEO.
[02:50:53.773 --> 02:50:58.874]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[02:50:59.254 --> 02:51:07.196]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[02:51:07.716 --> 02:51:14.097]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[02:51:14.437 --> 02:51:17.238]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[02:51:25.243 --> 02:51:33.231]  We're going to sell out of X3.
[02:51:33.251 --> 02:51:34.091]  We sold out of X2.
[02:51:34.192 --> 02:51:36.273]  It's a long time until we get more X2.
[02:51:36.574 --> 02:51:37.094]  X3 is amazing.
[02:51:37.174 --> 02:51:38.355]  It's three types of iodine.
[02:51:38.415 --> 02:51:39.777]  All X, including the D3 crystals.
[02:51:39.877 --> 02:51:40.657]  It's apples and oranges.
[02:51:40.697 --> 02:51:41.778]  They both do the same thing.
[02:51:41.798 --> 02:51:43.160]  But some people like this formula better.
[02:51:43.180 --> 02:51:43.840]  I talked to scientists.
[02:51:43.860 --> 02:51:45.202]  They said some people need all three types.
[02:51:45.342 --> 02:51:45.942]  So it's here.
[02:51:46.082 --> 02:51:48.144]  And it's going to run out in the one ounce in the next couple of days.
[02:51:48.204 --> 02:51:50.947]  The two ounce in probably about a week or two at this current rate.
[02:51:51.067 --> 02:51:51.167]  Yeah.
[02:52:21.727 --> 02:52:26.590]  That's all 50% off at InfoWarsTore.com right now.
[02:52:26.790 --> 02:52:28.411]  And go out and consult physicians.
[02:52:29.032 --> 02:52:31.493]  And they'll, every physician I've talked to, I've talked to a lot of them.
[02:52:31.513 --> 02:52:36.236]  I ran into an airplane, an airline pilot, flies for American yesterday.
[02:52:36.276 --> 02:52:38.497]  And then I was talking to a medical doctor.
[02:52:38.657 --> 02:52:39.998]  I'm going to see where I was, what I was doing.
[02:52:40.018 --> 02:52:42.460]  And he was like, Oh, absolutely.
[02:52:42.520 --> 02:52:43.680]  You can't find zinc anywhere.
[02:52:43.700 --> 02:52:45.782]  I'm telling my patients, you know, take zinc.
[02:52:45.842 --> 02:52:47.303]  And I said, well, how much?
[02:52:48.023 --> 02:52:49.204]  He said, 100 milligrams a day.
[02:52:50.137 --> 02:52:52.818]  He goes, if you taste it later, it tastes kind of acidy, means you're on too much.
[02:52:52.878 --> 02:52:55.559]  But, you know, they're giving 250 to people that already have it.
[02:52:55.879 --> 02:52:57.860]  That's not good for your kidneys, but it's better than dying.
[02:52:57.880 --> 02:52:59.140]  But wouldn't do it long term.
[02:52:59.400 --> 02:53:01.581]  And I said, well, I've been taking 30 milligrams a day.
[02:53:01.721 --> 02:53:04.062]  They said, yeah, I'd probably load up more than that.
[02:53:04.082 --> 02:53:05.162]  And on to 100 milligrams.
[02:53:05.382 --> 02:53:06.703]  That's what I'm doing.
[02:53:06.844 --> 02:53:13.971]  If you go to the NIH and type in zinc, it'll tell you right there that it's an immune booster, you gotta have it to live, cleans out the cells, protects the mitochondria.
[02:53:13.991 --> 02:53:15.512]  But that's the NIH, listen to them.
[02:53:16.033 --> 02:53:21.438]  Only listen to CNN, who's still saying hydroxychloroquine's bad, and there's no hope and you're all dead.
[02:53:22.700 --> 02:53:24.862]  Because only a vaccine will save you.
[02:53:25.831 --> 02:53:26.031]  Bio PQQ.
[02:53:56.075 --> 02:53:56.696]  Research that.
[02:53:57.016 --> 02:53:57.998]  Look into it for yourself.
[02:53:58.779 --> 02:54:00.702]  Big Brother and The Globalist don't want you to.
[02:54:01.343 --> 02:54:02.004]  CoQ10.
[02:54:02.124 --> 02:54:05.008]  Oh, you probably want to spend some time researching CoQ10.
[02:54:05.729 --> 02:54:10.056]  And then research DNA Force Plus and the types that we have in here.
[02:54:17.137 --> 02:54:22.299]  Natural ingredients from Mother Nature that are known to supercharge it all.
[02:54:22.840 --> 02:54:26.521]  This is our best-selling overall formula.
[02:54:26.901 --> 02:54:35.525]  And I've told listeners at the end of last year that we can't sell products at 50% off anymore because there's not enough markup in them to fund our operations.
[02:54:36.346 --> 02:54:39.107]  But because of what's happening and going on in the world right now,
[02:54:40.510 --> 02:54:49.226]  I really want everybody who hasn't used or tried or enjoyed the benefits of DNA Force Plus to have DNA Force Plus for yourself and your family.
[02:54:58.314 --> 02:55:03.880]  Does your shampoo leave your scalp itchy and your hair dry and frizzy?
