[00:00:22.862 --> 00:00:23.383]  99 days.
[00:00:23.383 --> 00:00:30.286]  99 days until the historic election.
[00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:39.811]  The way Fox News counts it, they count the day of the election as well, so that'd be 100 days, but... Anyway, you slice it, we're getting close into this historic event.
[00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:44.313]  Okay, I have done a lot of preparation for this Sunday transmission.
[00:00:44.313 --> 00:00:49.476]  Also, Ted Nugent's gonna be calling in at the start of the second hour today with some really huge news.
[00:00:50.441 --> 00:00:57.826]  The Democrats banned a pro-police rally in New York.
[00:00:57.826 --> 00:01:01.528]  The governor just said you can't have it.
[00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:05.010]  And said any police that, you know, show up or give you support, they'll be fired.
[00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.211]  Any state police will be fired.
[00:01:06.211 --> 00:01:07.732]  He's God now.
[00:01:07.732 --> 00:01:08.852]  He said because of COVID.
[00:01:08.852 --> 00:01:11.894]  But everybody else can demonstrate and have your protest.
[00:01:11.894 --> 00:01:17.458]  This is how the globalist, communist, Illuminati system operates.
[00:01:18.595 --> 00:01:20.418]  He'll be popping in.
[00:01:20.418 --> 00:01:22.362]  Okay, so it's now official.
[00:01:22.362 --> 00:01:27.411]  We've had Pelosi, we've had Biden, we've had Schiff, we've had...
[00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:49.513]  Eric Holder, the former Attorney General, we've had them all come out and say, Trump's a dictator already, he works for the Russians, and he's going to lose the election, and then if he challenges it in any way, he is a dictator, and the military is going to remove him, and if the military doesn't remove him, we'll have them arrested.
[00:01:49.513 --> 00:01:50.614]  And we'll burn down all the cities.
[00:01:54.085 --> 00:01:57.588]  Next, Atlantic Monthly, which is the mouth of the New World Order.
[00:01:57.588 --> 00:01:58.969]  Even more than the New York Times here in the U.S.
[00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:01.451]  It's the Financial Times of London.
[00:02:01.451 --> 00:02:03.093]  Over in England, that's the Rothschild mouthpiece.
[00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:10.420]  They're openly saying violence and riots will skyrocket if Trump wins election.
[00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.961]  You better not do it.
[00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:20.784]  And then Moody's and Barron's and all of the ratings agencies and Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan all say this will be a contested election.
[00:02:20.784 --> 00:02:22.164]  It's going to be a disaster.
[00:02:22.164 --> 00:02:24.925]  The mail-in ballots, the fraud.
[00:02:24.925 --> 00:02:29.066]  And if Trump points any of that out or you do, you're a dictator.
[00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:34.108]  Even though the Democrats win and if they lose, I think right now there's anywhere near a fair election they're going to lose.
[00:02:35.811 --> 00:02:40.372]  The asylum majority is really pissed, but they don't care.
[00:02:40.372 --> 00:03:00.618]  They will contest it, and when Trump says, you're there wrong, they're going to activate folks to burn the country down, and with 99 days out, this is all a beta test drill for that, and the censorship's in place, and the AI kill switch is in place, and Trump has not gotten control of the Obama kill switch, but the deep state still has, or the globalists that are installed at all those levels.
[00:03:02.554 --> 00:03:06.656]  What they call stay behind networks or embeds.
[00:03:06.656 --> 00:03:10.037]  So that is all coming up here tonight.
[00:03:10.037 --> 00:03:11.818]  We will break it down.
[00:03:11.818 --> 00:03:15.240]  The country and the entire world is in really unparalleled.
[00:03:16.786 --> 00:03:21.787]  Harold, and I do not have words to describe to you how serious the situation is.
[00:03:21.787 --> 00:03:25.208]  They've done everything they can to try to take us off air at this time.
[00:03:25.208 --> 00:03:34.171]  We're still on hundreds of radio stations, over 100 cable and TV stations, and we have huge audiences at BandOnVideo and InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:03:34.171 --> 00:03:38.432]  But remember, you are critical in this fight.
[00:03:38.432 --> 00:03:43.194]  Without you taking action and getting excited and telling people via email, via text message and word of mouth,
[00:03:44.136 --> 00:03:48.639]  About Bandot video, about Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:56.604]  Without you telling that all the doctors and scientists and whistleblowers that have been exposing the COVID-19 takeover hoax.
[00:03:56.604 --> 00:04:00.786]  Without you getting that information out, we're going to lose this fight.
[00:04:00.786 --> 00:04:03.528]  And I've got some incredible examples of that.
[00:04:03.528 --> 00:04:05.789]  Eric Bolling is going to be back on the show soon.
[00:04:05.789 --> 00:04:07.490]  He, of course, left Fox.
[00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:11.072]  The left celebrated it when his son overdosed on an opiate.
[00:04:11.072 --> 00:04:11.753]  He's a good guy.
[00:04:13.447 --> 00:04:25.510]  He was doing a report for Sinclair, it's as big as Fox or bigger around the country, the broadcast stations, about gain of function and how Fauci was involved with the Wuhan lab, weaponizing all of it.
[00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.872]  You know, I personally have sent him and Tucker Carlson and a bunch of other people hundreds of articles.
[00:04:30.872 --> 00:04:31.912]  I'll show you some of them today.
[00:04:33.015 --> 00:04:35.157]  Hell, from the NIH website, how Fauci did this.
[00:04:35.157 --> 00:04:36.117]  It's not even hidden.
[00:04:36.117 --> 00:04:38.119]  But CNN's policing it.
[00:04:38.119 --> 00:04:41.901]  And they made some calls, and Sinclair's not gonna air it now.
[00:04:41.901 --> 00:04:44.603]  Because, you know, Fauci's God.
[00:04:44.603 --> 00:04:46.645]  Everything he says is a lie, a fraud.
[00:04:46.645 --> 00:04:51.408]  He threw in the first pitch at a baseball game, was like 30 feet off the mound, in left field.
[00:04:51.408 --> 00:04:54.431]  I mean, they all cheered for him.
[00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:57.453]  I mean, the guy is a frickin' criminal who needs to be indicted.
[00:05:00.933 --> 00:05:05.137]  The reasons that the globalists launch this planetary lockdown.
[00:05:05.137 --> 00:05:09.320]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.804]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[00:05:13.804 --> 00:05:19.870]  The cashless society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:27.697]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential as we begin to
[00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:36.096]  Witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[00:05:36.096 --> 00:05:40.159]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:45.543]  It's been pre-planned, organized globally, and it's extremely predatory.
[00:05:45.543 --> 00:05:56.752]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[00:05:57.313 --> 00:06:02.596]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[00:06:02.596 --> 00:06:23.606]  Thank you so much for joining us on this July 26th Sunday live broadcast.
[00:06:23.606 --> 00:06:26.668]  99 days out from this historic election.
[00:06:27.881 --> 00:06:36.103]  Well, I have here in my hands, and I'm your host Alex Jones, thank you for joining us, CNN, the police dogs of thought crime.
[00:06:36.103 --> 00:06:43.964]  Sinclair says it will postpone and rework segment featuring conspiracy theory about Fauci.
[00:06:43.964 --> 00:06:52.246]  And it says that without any proof, though they don't show the piece, they were going to look at Fauci at the NIH for 45 years.
[00:06:54.187 --> 00:07:04.332]  Involving gain-of-function transfers of weaponized coronavirus during the Obama administration.
[00:07:04.332 --> 00:07:06.493]  Now, Dr. McCamshaw, please.
[00:07:06.493 --> 00:07:10.115]  Look right here.
[00:07:10.115 --> 00:07:15.858]  NIH lifts funding pause on gain-of-function research.
[00:07:15.858 --> 00:07:17.498]  NIH.gov.
[00:07:17.498 --> 00:07:22.561]  And it gets into Fauci, and the programs, and Bill O'Malley and the Gates, and the actual gain-of-function.
[00:07:23.905 --> 00:07:25.166]  Here's Newsweek.
[00:07:25.166 --> 00:07:27.868]  Dr. Fauci back controversial Wuhan lab with U.S.
[00:07:27.868 --> 00:07:36.215]  dollars for risky coronavirus research with spliced virus chimeras using weaponized bat viruses.
[00:07:36.215 --> 00:07:36.335]  Oh.
[00:07:36.335 --> 00:07:38.296]  Okay.
[00:07:38.296 --> 00:07:39.698]  Here's another one.
[00:07:39.698 --> 00:07:39.758]  2015.
[00:07:39.758 --> 00:07:42.360]  Lab-made coronavirus triggers debate.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:48.905]  Gain-of-function weaponized SARS COVID-2 virus.
[00:07:48.905 --> 00:07:51.287]  And it goes into how deadly it is to transfer it.
[00:07:53.112 --> 00:07:56.373]  I'll be getting into that a little bit later.
[00:07:56.373 --> 00:07:58.614]  The Emperor has no clothes.
[00:07:58.614 --> 00:08:04.937]  Everything Fauci has told us has been a giant, galactic-sized lie.
[00:08:04.937 --> 00:08:09.158]  He told us 2.5 million would be dead in America, then 2.2 million.
[00:08:09.158 --> 00:08:13.320]  Then he told us all the hospitals would be full and we needed hundreds of thousands of ventilators.
[00:08:15.697 --> 00:08:22.364]  And now as they test everybody, the number of positives goes up, the number of deaths goes down, but they put out the septum headlines saying record deaths.
[00:08:22.364 --> 00:08:25.707]  Then they'll say, oh, because it's some little town had three deaths.
[00:08:25.707 --> 00:08:28.029]  They didn't have any before, so now it's record deaths.
[00:08:28.029 --> 00:08:32.574]  They're all playing semantical games.
[00:08:32.574 --> 00:08:40.682]  And Greg Reeves did an excellent report that we're going to air coming up at the bottom of the hour, where he shows the NIH website currently.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:54.911]  Admitting that if you've ever had a bacterial infection, I didn't know that, they've added that, or a coronavirus, that's the common cold, or the flu, usually in about a decade, you will test positive for COVID-19.
[00:08:54.911 --> 00:09:02.938]  So when you see stories about there's 60% false positives, bull, you know what?
[00:09:02.938 --> 00:09:07.022]  Unbelievable fraud, because it was the Wuhan lab
[00:09:08.305 --> 00:09:19.992]  That had a Bill of Melinda Gates finance directive in it that created the test that was then approved seven months ago in China that we then adopted.
[00:09:19.992 --> 00:09:22.374]  Look it up.
[00:09:22.374 --> 00:09:24.855]  Unbelievable.
[00:09:24.855 --> 00:09:30.319]  And medical doctors are trying to write books and publish them and Amazon won't even let them sell them.
[00:09:30.319 --> 00:09:32.260]  But it's all NIH, it's all admitted.
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.462]  That's what's crazy is none of this is even hidden.
[00:09:39.781 --> 00:09:42.082]  I just showed you New Scientist.
[00:09:42.082 --> 00:09:45.044]  I just showed you NIH.
[00:09:45.044 --> 00:10:08.375]  I just showed you Newsweek saying Fauci ran the programs with Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation grants from them to the NIH and then given to the Wuhan lab in the hundreds of millions of dollars illegal gain-of-function weaponized testing that they shipped to China to do it there.
[00:10:09.565 --> 00:10:15.389]  Just like the CIA has black portrait sites in China under Obama.
[00:10:15.389 --> 00:10:31.760]  But then Sinclair, bigger than Fox, thousands of TV stations around the country, tried to air it, CNN tattled, and so now they're not gonna do it right.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.682]  Now this is how crazy this is.
[00:10:35.427 --> 00:10:43.772]  It's like if Eric Bolling wanted to have a thing on Sinclair saying Santa Claus has a big white beard and Santa Claus wears a red and white outfit.
[00:10:43.772 --> 00:10:44.973]  He's a jolly old elf.
[00:10:44.973 --> 00:10:46.634]  They'd say, oh, you can't talk about that.
[00:10:46.634 --> 00:10:50.076]  Santa Claus wears a green outfit.
[00:10:50.076 --> 00:10:52.958]  It's unbelievable fraud.
[00:10:52.958 --> 00:10:55.379]  Let me just stop there.
[00:10:55.379 --> 00:10:56.120]  Let me just stop there.
[00:11:05.305 --> 00:11:30.226]  The very same criminal groups that have brought you the overblown hoax of COVID-19, the very same groups that are telling us that we can never reopen the country again, but China's wide open, are the same ones telling you that every day when Black Lives Matter
[00:11:31.573 --> 00:11:37.756]  And Antifa shoot up innocent people's cars, in many cases brain damaging them and killing them.
[00:11:37.756 --> 00:11:41.398]  A whole bunch of deaths in the last three days.
[00:11:41.398 --> 00:11:50.522]  That that's peaceful, while simultaneously saying, we're gonna burn the country down if Trump gets re-elected in Atlantic Monthly.
[00:11:50.522 --> 00:11:57.065]  Oh, and we're gonna use the military to take Trump out if we challenge the election and he doesn't bow to that.
[00:11:57.065 --> 00:11:58.486]  I've got a bunch of compilations
[00:11:59.631 --> 00:12:05.933]  Of people being shot and shot at when we come back.
[00:12:05.933 --> 00:12:20.799]  And I'm going to go over for radio listeners and narrate it, but you have to understand that this is systematic, terroristic activity being done to bring this nation to its knees and intimidate Americans.
[00:12:20.799 --> 00:12:22.919]  And people say, well, Americans won't be intimidated.
[00:12:22.919 --> 00:12:23.720]  This will backfire.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:23.960]  Really?
[00:12:27.028 --> 00:12:33.971]  Public schools and colleges all over the country, if you try to say man or woman on the entrance form, we'll throw you out!
[00:12:33.971 --> 00:12:36.171]  We live in a cult!
[00:12:36.171 --> 00:12:41.293]  Look at political correctness!
[00:12:41.293 --> 00:12:49.737]  On YouTube, they get strikes on famous chess channels if white knight takes black pawn, because that could be seen as racist.
[00:12:49.737 --> 00:12:51.617]  I was telling a lawyer that, and he didn't believe me.
[00:12:51.617 --> 00:12:53.298]  He pulled it up and his mouth fell open.
[00:12:55.851 --> 00:13:07.874]  That's the level of the cult and we've bowed to them so much for so long they think we're going to bow to them again and forever.
[00:13:07.874 --> 00:13:11.395]  But one young man last night in Austin thought that too.
[00:13:11.395 --> 00:13:13.015]  We'll play that when we come back.
[00:13:13.015 --> 00:13:15.156]  He's got his AK-47.
[00:13:15.156 --> 00:13:17.117]  He's too ignorant to know that it's actually like a Mac 90.
[00:13:17.117 --> 00:13:18.377]  It's semi-auto.
[00:13:20.014 --> 00:13:22.815]  And he says, you know, I'd like to kill some police.
[00:13:22.815 --> 00:13:25.977]  If I kill cops, they'll kill me, so we'll see.
[00:13:25.977 --> 00:13:31.700]  He goes, none of these people out here that we're going to be menacing or threatening have got any balls.
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:35.541]  And so he said, well, you'll see what he said when we come back.
[00:13:35.541 --> 00:13:37.222]  We'll play that first.
[00:13:37.222 --> 00:13:41.344]  And then he runs out into traffic and blocks people's cars.
[00:13:41.344 --> 00:13:42.985]  And the witnesses say he raised the gun.
[00:13:42.985 --> 00:13:45.146]  And there's video of him raising it up towards the window.
[00:13:45.146 --> 00:13:48.888]  And then you hear what sounds like rifle shots and then handgun shots.
[00:13:49.688 --> 00:13:56.770]  And some journalists are saying that that's why the news is being suppressed is what happened because it looks like it's like a Somali in Seattle drove through.
[00:13:56.770 --> 00:13:58.271]  They were running around on the road at night.
[00:13:58.271 --> 00:13:59.051]  He hit two women.
[00:13:59.051 --> 00:14:00.711]  They wanted to say it was a white supremacist.
[00:14:00.711 --> 00:14:02.792]  For days they wouldn't say what color he was.
[00:14:02.792 --> 00:14:08.174]  It was a Somali guy that just got on the highway and people ran out in front of him at night.
[00:14:08.174 --> 00:14:10.895]  And you saw that story go away?
[00:14:10.895 --> 00:14:12.135]  But the point is is that
[00:14:14.482 --> 00:14:18.784]  You heard, oh, a white supremacist attacked somebody for no reason in Austin last night.
[00:14:18.784 --> 00:14:31.548]  And then we've got all this footage of BLM, mainly white people, and Antifa all over the country running out in roads and just shooting at vehicles.
[00:14:31.548 --> 00:14:37.751]  But I kept saying, man, in a lot of areas of Texas, you run up and surround somebody's car and then point a rifle at them?
[00:14:39.326 --> 00:14:44.791]  It's not going to go well, but that's why the orders from Soros have come down in places like St.
[00:14:44.791 --> 00:14:49.915]  Louis with the McCluskey family, where they broke down their gate, came on their yard, were threatening to kill them.
[00:14:49.915 --> 00:14:51.096]  It's on the video.
[00:14:51.096 --> 00:14:52.437]  They pointed guns at them.
[00:14:52.437 --> 00:14:53.699]  One of them was a prop.
[00:14:53.699 --> 00:14:54.840]  They were lawyers.
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:56.281]  It was a prop from a case they had.
[00:14:59.738 --> 00:15:10.762]  And they SWAT teamed them, now they've indicted them, because they want the message that when we come to burn your house, you bow down and don't fight back, so the riots can get steam and really burn down the country.
[00:15:10.762 --> 00:15:25.406]  Because they want the citizens to stand down, and the police to stand down, so they can take full control of all the government buildings, just like the Bolsheviks did in 1917, and refuse fascism, and all the Soros-funded groups admit that's their plan.
[00:15:25.406 --> 00:15:26.907]  And they just overthrew Ukraine!
[00:15:27.367 --> 00:15:33.573]  Five years ago, with the very same groups, and the very same tactics!
[00:15:33.573 --> 00:15:40.220]  And now, Atlantic Monthly and others are saying, and remember what Maxine Waters said, confront these people everywhere, attack them everywhere!
[00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:44.845]  And now they've gone to the head of DHS's house, and they're threatening him!
[00:15:44.845 --> 00:15:46.786]  Because that's what they do!
[00:15:46.786 --> 00:15:48.909]  They went to Mitch McConnell's house and said, we're gonna murder you!
[00:15:50.063 --> 00:15:55.158]  When Mitch said it was wrong, Twitter censored him and Mitch McConnell faint twittering on his knees.
[00:15:55.158 --> 00:15:57.364]  So you're capitulating as asking for this.
[00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:04.311]  Storeable food is again available for shipping within three to four weeks.
[00:16:04.311 --> 00:16:04.952]  We have it.
[00:16:04.952 --> 00:16:08.433]  It's high quality, but it's got to be packaged and shipped out to you.
[00:16:08.433 --> 00:16:10.973]  Some items are shipping in a week, some in four weeks.
[00:16:10.973 --> 00:16:12.314]  So they're saying three to four weeks.
[00:16:12.314 --> 00:16:13.374]  It's my Patriot.
[00:16:13.374 --> 00:16:14.434]  We have their full catalog.
[00:16:14.434 --> 00:16:17.355]  They're in our back end at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:16:17.355 --> 00:16:22.397]  Get your orders in now before the next big surge comes in.
[00:16:22.397 --> 00:16:27.218]  Believe me, every angle I've looked at tells me that really, really serious times are ahead.
[00:16:27.538 --> 00:16:35.488]  Whether Trump wins or loses, the globalists have already created a worldwide depression, lockdowns on a planetary scale, and it's only intensifying.
[00:16:35.488 --> 00:16:38.693]  This is one of the big boxes you've got to get checked off.
[00:16:38.693 --> 00:16:40.155]  It's high quality, affordable food.
[00:16:40.155 --> 00:16:44.180]  My Patriot has really good, high quality food at a very affordable price.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:47.402]  And the packaging is the best you're going to find out there.
[00:16:47.402 --> 00:16:50.483]  Check it out for yourself at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:16:50.483 --> 00:16:57.127]  And then, the money that comes in that's extra helps us fund the information warfare operation that fights the globalist toe-to-toe.
[00:16:57.127 --> 00:16:59.608]  Get your storable food now at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:16:59.608 --> 00:17:04.830]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:17:04.830 --> 00:17:06.451]  You can wear them out to political events.
[00:17:06.451 --> 00:17:08.152]  You can trigger LibTards.
[00:17:08.152 --> 00:17:13.515]  One of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or
[00:17:14.241 --> 00:17:15.301]  At Halloween.
[00:17:15.301 --> 00:17:21.543]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[00:17:21.543 --> 00:17:28.144]  It's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the forced inoculations and contact tracing that they're openly announcing.
[00:17:28.144 --> 00:17:29.945]  It's an act of submission.
[00:17:29.945 --> 00:17:33.366]  It's an act of like putting a burka on your head and bowing down.
[00:17:33.366 --> 00:17:38.247]  But a big reason to wear these is then into stores when people ask you why you're wearing a Halloween mask, say,
[00:17:38.706 --> 00:17:43.108]  It's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing.
[00:17:43.108 --> 00:17:46.909]  And the M95 mask only controls what's coming in, not what's going out.
[00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:48.990]  So they quote, spread COVID-19.
[00:17:48.990 --> 00:17:50.490]  They don't protect from it.
[00:17:50.490 --> 00:17:53.451]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back in these control freak spaces.
[00:17:53.451 --> 00:17:56.092]  You buy one for $9.95, you get four more free.
[00:17:56.092 --> 00:17:57.092]  They're at cost.
[00:17:57.092 --> 00:17:58.493]  Infowarrestore.com.
[00:18:00.151 --> 00:18:10.466]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[00:18:10.466 --> 00:18:15.173]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[00:18:15.854 --> 00:18:24.217]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[00:18:24.217 --> 00:18:44.104]  And the good news is there are still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, paulwatsonsite, summit.news, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own
[00:18:44.744 --> 00:18:45.785]  Destinies.
[00:18:45.785 --> 00:18:52.708]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy.
[00:18:52.708 --> 00:18:57.211]  But being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it will defeat it.
[00:18:57.211 --> 00:19:00.933]  So take action or be slaves.
[00:19:00.933 --> 00:19:09.057]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[00:19:10.393 --> 00:19:15.137]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[00:19:15.137 --> 00:19:17.479]  Super Male Vitality!
[00:19:17.479 --> 00:19:26.346]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[00:19:26.346 --> 00:19:37.195]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[00:19:37.495 --> 00:19:38.175]  Yes.
[00:19:38.175 --> 00:19:43.077]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[00:19:43.077 --> 00:19:49.838]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[00:19:49.838 --> 00:19:51.039]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:19:51.039 --> 00:19:52.899]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[00:19:52.899 --> 00:19:55.720]  Never been a better time than right now.
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:20:03.782]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:20:03.782 --> 00:20:06.463]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:24.044 --> 00:20:36.832]  The social engineers, the globalists, and their bought-and-paid-for corporate media that's back on the chi-coms and every other America-hating institution are counting on sucker-punching the American people.
[00:20:37.639 --> 00:21:01.181]  But I've been reading the Council on Foreign Relations reports and tracking them since Trump got elected, and they talked about triggering nationwide riots, calling it racial, and then using that as the pretext to have a coup against the President, and then they think everybody will just sit down in fear and accept it, but they need a lockdown in place first, and that's what they're using the virus for, so you're used to being told, stay in your home, do what we say.
[00:21:02.227 --> 00:21:05.548]  We've already put you into that artificial martial law.
[00:21:05.548 --> 00:21:07.189]  So here's the headline for the live show today.
[00:21:07.189 --> 00:21:07.949]  I hope you'll share it.
[00:21:07.949 --> 00:21:09.990]  That's how we reach new people and stop this.
[00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.510]  Red alert!
[00:21:10.510 --> 00:21:14.312]  Deep state Dems have already launched a violent plan to overthrow the U.S.
[00:21:14.312 --> 00:21:16.072]  government.
[00:21:16.072 --> 00:21:20.134]  Now let me show you some news articles and I'm going to play the clips proving it all.
[00:21:20.134 --> 00:21:20.934]  Schiff!
[00:21:20.934 --> 00:21:31.238]  Trump will refuse to accept election results and allow peaceful transition, though they're the ones gearing up for total violence now with people being killed every couple hours and the media in lockstep covering it up.
[00:21:31.997 --> 00:21:36.779]  Leftist mag issues threat violence and riots will skyrocket if Trump wins election.
[00:21:36.779 --> 00:21:38.400]  That's Atlantic Monthly.
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:42.722]  Black Trump supporter executed in broad daylight for holding up a Trump sign in Wisconsin.
[00:21:42.722 --> 00:21:47.145]  Leftist pledge anyone supporting Trump will be murdered.
[00:21:47.145 --> 00:21:49.426]  All they want to do is condemn law enforcement.
[00:21:49.426 --> 00:21:53.108]  DHS Secretary Chad Wolf blasts Democrats on Fox News.
[00:21:53.108 --> 00:21:54.969]  They come to his house, threaten to kill him.
[00:21:55.882 --> 00:21:57.842]  That's right, townhall.com.
[00:21:57.842 --> 00:22:04.524]  Meanwhile, Portland rioters occupy exterior of federal courthouse, raise American flag upside down, because they're inverting it.
[00:22:04.524 --> 00:22:05.164]  Actually, it's true.
[00:22:05.164 --> 00:22:07.404]  The country is in crisis.
[00:22:07.404 --> 00:22:09.405]  That's coming up.
[00:22:09.405 --> 00:22:15.266]  Radio host mocks Trump by claiming Seattle's peaceful, then rioters burn down his apartment building.
[00:22:15.266 --> 00:22:21.587]  Video, Colorado BLM protester shoots fellow demonstrator while aiming at a car that sped through the crowd.
[00:22:21.587 --> 00:22:23.628]  They just ran on the highway trying to be hit.
[00:22:24.636 --> 00:22:27.477]  And the glass from a Somali hit him so they couldn't say white supremacist.
[00:22:27.477 --> 00:22:28.477]  The guy didn't know what was happening.
[00:22:28.477 --> 00:22:30.478]  He just ran out in front of him at night.
[00:22:30.478 --> 00:22:32.118]  Protests erupt across country.
[00:22:32.118 --> 00:22:35.099]  Black militia member accidentally shoots comrades in parts.
[00:22:35.099 --> 00:22:37.860]  Promptly blames white supremacism.
[00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:43.902]  Black Lives Matter activists have their toddlers carry F the police signs and use them as human shields.
[00:22:43.902 --> 00:22:47.783]  Black conservatives stabbed by anti-med during Portland Black Lives Matter riots.
[00:22:47.783 --> 00:22:48.583]  Shocking video.
[00:22:48.583 --> 00:22:50.104]  We're going to play all this next segment.
[00:22:51.161 --> 00:22:52.922]  And the flag upside down.
[00:22:52.922 --> 00:22:54.563]  Austin Protester.
[00:22:54.563 --> 00:22:55.823]  Allegedly armed with AK-47.
[00:22:55.823 --> 00:22:58.024]  I don't know why it says allegedly.
[00:22:58.024 --> 00:22:59.185]  He said he had an AK-47.
[00:22:59.185 --> 00:23:01.426]  It was a semi-automatic version of that.
[00:23:01.426 --> 00:23:06.289]  Shot by a driver while blocking traffic and approaching vehicle.
[00:23:06.289 --> 00:23:09.850]  We're gonna get to that first, right now.
[00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:12.612]  Listen to what... By the way, look at this guy's background.
[00:23:12.612 --> 00:23:15.033]  You talk about a creep.
[00:23:15.033 --> 00:23:15.913]  I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[00:23:17.776 --> 00:23:21.299]  You talk about bizarre and stupid.
[00:23:21.299 --> 00:23:24.981]  LARPing out at night, blocking traffic with a gun, pointing it at somebody.
[00:23:24.981 --> 00:23:25.362]  A threat.
[00:23:25.362 --> 00:23:27.303]  People have a right to defend themselves.
[00:23:27.303 --> 00:23:30.725]  But this individual, we've got his name, all the information is on Infowars.com.
[00:23:30.725 --> 00:23:38.911]  Here's what he said about ten minutes before he ran out with a mob to stop cars, pointed his gun reportedly at somebody and got shot.
[00:23:38.911 --> 00:23:39.212]  Here it is.
[00:23:43.032 --> 00:23:44.254]  Oh, it's AK-47.
[00:23:44.254 --> 00:23:48.101]  Why'd you got it out tonight?
[00:23:48.101 --> 00:23:52.049]  They don't let us march in the streets anymore, so I got to practice some of our rights.
[00:23:54.213 --> 00:23:57.436]  Do you feel like you'll need to use it?
[00:23:57.436 --> 00:24:03.982]  Nah, I think the uh... I mean if I use it against the cops I'm dead.
[00:24:03.982 --> 00:24:13.650]  And I think all the people that hate us and you know want to say s*** to us are too big of a pussies to stop and actually do anything about it.
[00:24:14.711 --> 00:24:16.572]  Why'd you start carrying?
[00:24:16.572 --> 00:24:21.796]  Well, our roommate got arrested and they stopped letting us march anywhere, so I started carrying.
[00:24:21.796 --> 00:24:21.916]  Thanks.
[00:24:45.312 --> 00:24:51.880]  But you hear in the video it sounds like he's shooting first, you hear a rifle shoot, then you hear three shots return that are muffled.
[00:24:52.762 --> 00:24:58.647]  And that's what experts that are looking at the tape are saying, but of course it will be covered up by the leftist city of Austin, if that is indeed the case.
[00:24:58.647 --> 00:25:02.970]  But regardless, run out in traffic, block somebody, point a gun at them, this is what happens.
[00:25:02.970 --> 00:25:08.555]  We have all these videos that just happened of them shooting at cars and actually shooting people.
[00:25:08.555 --> 00:25:10.737]  And when it happens, it's hardly on the news.
[00:25:10.737 --> 00:25:16.341]  It's a little blip on the radar screen that, oh, peaceful protesters shot somebody else today.
[00:25:16.341 --> 00:25:17.803]  Here's one shock video.
[00:25:17.803 --> 00:25:20.345]  BLM Antifa rioter shoots driver
[00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:26.150]  Trying to pass protests across the country.
[00:25:26.150 --> 00:25:30.291]  Black militia member accidentally shoots comrades in a park.
[00:25:30.291 --> 00:25:39.773]  And we're showing all this for TV viewers.
[00:25:39.773 --> 00:25:40.394]  Let's do this.
[00:25:40.394 --> 00:25:41.514]  Let's let's do this.
[00:25:41.514 --> 00:25:43.014]  Let's start over.
[00:25:43.014 --> 00:25:49.136]  Let's start over to the beginning and let's roll compilation clip.
[00:25:49.136 --> 00:25:49.596]  One place.
[00:25:49.596 --> 00:25:49.916]  Here it is.
[00:25:52.915 --> 00:25:56.196]  So a guy's driving down the road, and they just shoot at him.
[00:25:56.196 --> 00:25:58.757]  There's your peaceful sorrows, folks.
[00:25:58.757 --> 00:26:03.438]  Now, here's Kentucky yesterday.
[00:26:03.438 --> 00:26:05.539]  And they just fire a shotgun at people.
[00:26:05.539 --> 00:26:12.541]  And they tell everybody to get down.
[00:26:12.541 --> 00:26:17.923]  And these folks are also on video coming up to random cars and saying, I'll kill you, to white people.
[00:26:19.133 --> 00:26:23.377]  Here's some more BLM, mainly white trendies in Aurora, Colorado.
[00:26:23.377 --> 00:26:24.438]  There's chopper footage.
[00:26:24.438 --> 00:26:29.702]  They just run out on the highway and the car doesn't know what to do, so they shoot at it.
[00:26:29.702 --> 00:26:32.725]  Here's the Austin protester with his AK-47.
[00:26:34.983 --> 00:26:49.175]  Who runs out, and again, we've got paused still shots on InfoWars.com from the video showing him with the rifle up to the window of the car with people beating on it, screaming, going, he's white, he's white, trying to pull the white person out.
[00:26:49.175 --> 00:26:51.878]  And it's white people mainly saying and doing it.
[00:26:51.878 --> 00:26:56.502]  It's like when H3LX famously yells at Owen Schroyer and says, you don't have a right to speak!
[00:26:56.502 --> 00:26:57.763]  You're an effing white male!
[00:26:59.636 --> 00:27:07.618]  That's the craziness of you're just downtown Austin driving, and there are people with guns and hatchets and hammers, and they've attacked us with hammers.
[00:27:07.618 --> 00:27:09.479]  And the media goes, well, Jones deserves it!
[00:27:09.479 --> 00:27:11.199]  This is peaceful!
[00:27:11.199 --> 00:27:23.483]  And all these armchair leftists, like the mayor of Portland, went out to support them, burning down the courthouse, and then they attack him because he's an old white dude.
[00:27:23.483 --> 00:27:25.204]  They go, look, he's white!
[00:27:25.204 --> 00:27:29.085]  They don't even know he's the mayor under Soros, commanding them!
[00:27:31.328 --> 00:27:38.913]  They don't even know he's their general come to praise them while they pull down the American flag and hoist it upside down.
[00:27:38.913 --> 00:27:45.857]  Not even knowing they put up the right symbol that America is in grave distress and is in grave crisis.
[00:27:45.857 --> 00:27:54.502]  We're going to go to break and I'm going to come back and go through more videos and individual videos of them shooting people in the head with pleasure.
[00:27:54.502 --> 00:27:55.683]  You're just driving your truck.
[00:27:55.683 --> 00:27:57.544]  They run out in front of you.
[00:27:57.544 --> 00:27:58.545]  Here's Utah right here.
[00:28:00.973 --> 00:28:04.816]  And boom, and we've got Colorado, another Colorado.
[00:28:04.816 --> 00:28:10.562]  Oh wait, there's more, not just yesterday's Colorado, we have another Colorado, where they shoot the man.
[00:28:10.562 --> 00:28:15.065]  Last time I heard, he's in critical condition, brain dead.
[00:28:15.065 --> 00:28:22.152]  And it was a liberal white lawyer, did it, and he, in his mug shot, he's so proud of what he did, he shot a Nazi.
[00:28:23.467 --> 00:28:27.751]  And oh, by the way, when they shot him in the head, he drove a few blocks and passed out.
[00:28:27.751 --> 00:28:31.894]  They went to the police and said, a white supremacist attacked us.
[00:28:31.894 --> 00:28:33.836]  Oh, yes, yes.
[00:28:33.836 --> 00:28:39.061]  That's what happens when they run and jump on your car, right out on the highway in front of a Somali.
[00:28:39.061 --> 00:28:40.202]  Oh, look, there's a car going at you.
[00:28:40.202 --> 00:28:41.162]  Let me, let me run after him.
[00:28:41.162 --> 00:28:41.483]  Bleh!
[00:28:41.483 --> 00:28:43.825]  A few people, you know, one lady gets killed, another one almost does.
[00:28:43.825 --> 00:28:45.186]  They're like, white supremacist!
[00:28:45.186 --> 00:28:46.407]  White supremacist!
[00:28:46.407 --> 00:28:47.348]  White supremacist!
[00:28:47.348 --> 00:28:48.489]  They're trying to drag him out of the car.
[00:28:48.489 --> 00:28:49.290]  They go, wait, he's black!
[00:28:49.930 --> 00:28:52.474]  And still they cover it up and go, WHITES ARE ATTACKING!
[00:28:52.474 --> 00:28:53.616]  WHITES ARE KILLING ME!
[00:29:00.783 --> 00:29:18.530]  Imagine telling someone just a year ago that in the middle of 2020, the Democrats, as well as many Republican leaders, will be calling for the United Nations WHO edict that all Americans wear masks, be a quote, federal order and mandate.
[00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:22.012]  Totally unconstitutional, annihilating states' rights.
[00:29:23.132 --> 00:29:23.933]  Think about that.
[00:29:23.933 --> 00:29:26.054]  A woman can kill her baby.
[00:29:26.054 --> 00:29:28.456]  We paid for illegal aliens healthcare.
[00:29:28.456 --> 00:29:37.222]  But you've got to wear a mask for a virus that killed 20 plus times less than what they said, even if you believe the official story.
[00:29:37.222 --> 00:29:46.048]  This is about the WHO, the globalists, testing their power through the media over the federal government to set policy in the United States.
[00:29:46.048 --> 00:29:50.952]  This is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the Paris Accord and all of it.
[00:29:51.232 --> 00:29:52.793]  And by the way, they admit that.
[00:29:52.793 --> 00:30:00.639]  They say, now your carbon's down one way or another, you stupid Americans.
[00:30:00.639 --> 00:30:05.282]  There are a lot of signs that people are really waking up to the new world order and global government.
[00:30:05.282 --> 00:30:08.405]  But one of the biggest is privacy pouches.
[00:30:08.405 --> 00:30:11.307]  I've been selling these for more than 10 years.
[00:30:11.307 --> 00:30:13.388]  In the old days, they weren't 100% effective.
[00:30:13.388 --> 00:30:14.189]  Now they are.
[00:30:14.189 --> 00:30:16.971]  They're little bitty, lightweight Faraday cages that
[00:30:16.971 --> 00:30:17.551]  I think so.
[00:30:40.299 --> 00:30:42.860]  Well, I gotta tell you, normally we probably sold a couple hundred a month.
[00:30:42.860 --> 00:30:46.421]  We're selling upwards of a thousand of these a day.
[00:30:46.421 --> 00:30:48.562]  Plus, we have a good unit and it's also a good price.
[00:30:48.562 --> 00:30:50.123]  We have it in four different colors.
[00:30:50.123 --> 00:30:53.304]  It's the Privacy Pockets at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:53.304 --> 00:30:54.584]  People are really waking up.
[00:30:54.584 --> 00:30:58.566]  I'm seeing it all over the news that folks are aware of this and are now using these.
[00:30:58.566 --> 00:30:59.666]  Get yours at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:09.952 --> 00:31:14.895]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[00:31:14.895 --> 00:31:19.518]  Where did it come from?
[00:31:19.518 --> 00:31:24.901]  InfoWarsTore.com We can't survive without pure, clean drinking water.

[00:32:01.284 --> 00:32:16.807]  CNN, USA Today, and other mainstream media fake news outlets came out and said that a new Trump campaign t-shirt that has an American eagle spreading its wings standing on top of an American flag is Nazi!
[00:32:16.807 --> 00:32:24.689]  And they had the Soros-funded Snopes groups and others fact-check it and say, yes, now the American flag and yes, the American eagle are Nazis.
[00:32:24.689 --> 00:32:25.569]  No, George Soros
[00:32:25.589 --> 00:32:26.189]  We're good to go.
[00:33:03.295 --> 00:33:12.121]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:12.121 --> 00:33:12.922]  Another world.
[00:33:12.922 --> 00:33:14.463]  Another time.
[00:33:14.463 --> 00:33:15.144]  Another time.
[00:33:15.144 --> 00:33:17.125]  In the age of wonder.
[00:33:17.125 --> 00:33:18.086]  In the age of wonder.
[00:33:35.988 --> 00:33:39.450]  Power of our source is the truth, and it will prevail.
[00:33:57.668 --> 00:33:58.448]  All right.
[00:33:58.448 --> 00:34:00.589]  Anybody can just type into a search engine.
[00:34:00.589 --> 00:34:02.831]  Virginia gun rally ends peacefully.
[00:34:02.831 --> 00:34:04.351]  Mother Jones had to admit it.
[00:34:04.351 --> 00:34:06.192]  The Associated Press had to admit it.
[00:34:06.192 --> 00:34:07.333]  The state police estimated 28,000.
[00:34:07.333 --> 00:34:10.414]  I estimated about 40,000 people.
[00:34:10.414 --> 00:34:14.836]  White, black, Hispanic, Asian, old, young, all came out together.
[00:34:14.836 --> 00:34:20.239]  Even though they closed half the Capitol grounds so it wouldn't look like a big crowd.
[00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:23.580]  They filled five, six, seven, eight, nine streets in all directions.
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:24.221]  It was amazing.
[00:34:25.317 --> 00:34:30.079]  One arrest of somebody getting in a fist fight who was a leftist.
[00:34:30.079 --> 00:34:33.721]  And it totally freaked the globalists out.
[00:34:33.721 --> 00:34:42.846]  And now they gave you COVID-19, and they say conservatives aren't allowed to have demonstrations, but the left and the communists, they can go out and burn and attack and do what they want.
[00:34:42.846 --> 00:34:46.948]  So, no one hurt, incredibly safe, the left scared to death.
[00:34:46.948 --> 00:34:51.490]  Meanwhile, there are so many stabbings and shootings and murders every day.
[00:34:52.429 --> 00:34:59.672]  Of white people at the hands of whites and blacks saying they deserve it because they're white.
[00:34:59.672 --> 00:35:02.014]  And there are black people that are Trump supporters being murdered.
[00:35:02.014 --> 00:35:07.596]  Another man shot multiple times for holding up a Trump sign in Milwaukee and trying to talk to crowds of people.
[00:35:07.596 --> 00:35:15.220]  And folks thought Trump was so bad, they went and they killed him and left us in the news saying, bring in the federal troops, we're ready to kill you!
[00:35:16.886 --> 00:35:26.615]  And there are people on Twitter saying, we're going to get Jones, bounties for Jones, publicly, who are real people, even though that's soliciting murder.
[00:35:26.615 --> 00:35:27.896]  Murder for hire.
[00:35:27.896 --> 00:35:29.457]  They're making their move.
[00:35:29.457 --> 00:35:35.202]  And the Democrat Deep State is saying, you don't submit to us, we'll put you in prison.
[00:35:35.202 --> 00:35:43.610]  When we remove Trump by force, anybody stands with him, including cabinet members, and shows his side, you will be put in prison.
[00:35:45.051 --> 00:35:46.012]  Oh, I feel so safe.
[00:35:46.012 --> 00:35:49.054]  Let me submit to you and put your communist handcuffs on.
[00:35:49.054 --> 00:35:51.796]  I'm sure you'll be real nice once I let you take over.
[00:35:51.796 --> 00:35:56.280]  No, I think it'll be the other way around.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.201]  People, oh, Jones, you better watch it.
[00:35:58.201 --> 00:35:59.342]  They could get you.
[00:35:59.342 --> 00:36:00.503]  That's the whole point.
[00:36:00.503 --> 00:36:03.065]  Bowing down to this evil goddess here.
[00:36:03.065 --> 00:36:06.267]  I know InfoWars is under attack.
[00:36:06.267 --> 00:36:08.069]  People say, what do you have your son on air?
[00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:11.571]  I mean, he's three inches taller than me.
[00:36:11.571 --> 00:36:12.252]  He's about to be 18.
[00:36:12.252 --> 00:36:13.553]  He wants to be on air.
[00:36:16.152 --> 00:36:20.637]  About a third of George Washington's troops were like 13, 14 years old.
[00:36:20.637 --> 00:36:25.102]  Since when do we domesticate our children?
[00:36:25.102 --> 00:36:26.823]  Well, you got your son out at these rallies.
[00:36:26.823 --> 00:36:27.985]  He's out at those rallies!
[00:36:30.549 --> 00:36:32.551]  And it's everybody thinking they're so smart.
[00:36:32.551 --> 00:36:34.793]  I see all these so-called conservative videos on YouTube.
[00:36:34.793 --> 00:36:40.618]  People sending in one, Jones needs to watch himself, and you know, he shouldn't have his son out there.
[00:36:40.618 --> 00:36:41.779]  Something bad could happen.
[00:36:41.779 --> 00:36:43.340]  Yeah, like a New World Order takeover?
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:48.405]  Because we all just keep bending over and trying to keep safe and trying to keep our heads down?
[00:36:48.405 --> 00:36:51.708]  That's not what it is to be an American.
[00:36:51.708 --> 00:36:52.608]  I'm all in.
[00:36:52.608 --> 00:36:53.749]  My son's all in.
[00:36:53.749 --> 00:36:55.431]  I pray for my family every day.
[00:36:55.431 --> 00:36:56.512]  It's in God's hands now.
[00:36:58.874 --> 00:37:03.258]  At least he'll be dying on his feet and not on his knees!
[00:37:03.258 --> 00:37:05.761]  A thousand deaths!
[00:37:05.761 --> 00:37:14.029]  Do you understand this groveling to the system has conjured the communists and the devil worshippers and the child molesters and all the evil?
[00:37:20.011 --> 00:37:25.375]  They think going to everybody's house and death threatening them, Tucker Carlson, myself, DHS had all of them.
[00:37:25.375 --> 00:37:28.597]  They think that that will intimidate everybody.
[00:37:28.597 --> 00:37:29.558]  And maybe they're right.
[00:37:29.558 --> 00:37:32.080]  Maybe we're not made of what we were before.
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:34.141]  Maybe people think laying down is the way to go.
[00:37:34.141 --> 00:37:37.904]  But I didn't bring that up to act like I'm Billy Badass.
[00:37:37.904 --> 00:37:38.604]  I'm not.
[00:37:38.604 --> 00:37:42.567]  I understand the threat so bad, I better stand up against it.
[00:37:42.567 --> 00:37:43.888]  Rather than wait.
[00:37:43.888 --> 00:37:46.970]  Guys, print me the Alexander Shultz and Edson quote, please.
[00:37:46.970 --> 00:37:48.031]  Oh, how we burned the camps.
[00:37:48.031 --> 00:37:49.052]  I'm going to read that next segment.
[00:37:50.452 --> 00:37:52.394]  It's about two paragraphs long.
[00:37:52.394 --> 00:37:53.114]  I want the full quote.
[00:37:53.114 --> 00:37:53.635]  Thank you.
[00:37:53.635 --> 00:37:55.657]  From Gulag Archipelago.
[00:37:55.657 --> 00:38:04.204]  Oh, later how we burned in the camps wishing we could have done something at the beginning when they started coming for us.
[00:38:04.204 --> 00:38:10.810]  Well, I'm doing everything I can in the information war to shape the battle space, to fix this peacefully.
[00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:13.813]  But if it's war they've been looking for, it's war they're going to get.
[00:38:15.253 --> 00:38:18.296]  And you make sure, folks, you don't follow the media's programming.
[00:38:18.296 --> 00:38:22.400]  If a real civil war breaks out, which we're already in the early stages of now, they're igniting it.
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:27.886]  You don't go fight anti for trash and people in downtown with morons brainwashed.
[00:38:27.886 --> 00:38:29.988]  It's who sent them.
[00:38:29.988 --> 00:38:33.492]  And they want to come to our houses?
[00:38:38.783 --> 00:38:43.968]  That's why all the real establishment are on private islands hiding out right now, saying for COVID.
[00:38:43.968 --> 00:38:46.030]  They're not hiding out from COVID.
[00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:50.034]  They're all in New Zealand because this is their communist overthrow.
[00:38:50.034 --> 00:38:51.495]  And they're not going to do the fighting and dying.
[00:38:51.495 --> 00:38:56.480]  Well, I assure you in Kauai and in Tasmania,
[00:38:57.885 --> 00:39:05.230]  And in New Zealand, and in Switzerland, that you're being watched right now by the people that are cooking your food.
[00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:12.315]  And the first thing they're gonna do once it all kicks off is slit your throat ear to ear.
[00:39:12.315 --> 00:39:14.236]  Is bash your brains out.
[00:39:14.236 --> 00:39:20.160]  And they won't be like some uncoordinated leftist.
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:22.622]  You're all dead.
[00:39:22.622 --> 00:39:26.585]  So, I would advise you to stop now.
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:36.774]  Because the Russians are strong, good, smart people, but they were serfs for 500 years and hadn't had a real revolution yet.
[00:39:36.774 --> 00:39:39.659]  You won't go the way your little commie revolution went.
[00:39:41.055 --> 00:39:45.559]  In Russia, where you got to piss on Christians for 85 years and kill 50 million of them.
[00:39:45.559 --> 00:39:47.141]  It won't go that way.
[00:39:47.141 --> 00:39:55.248]  You dirty, Jacobin, Bolshevik trash and your billionaire owners are all gonna pay.
[00:39:55.248 --> 00:40:06.318]  And when we're done, it may not be me around to see it, we're gonna dig you out of your holes and we're gonna make sure you face trial before you get marched up there.
[00:40:08.018 --> 00:40:26.813]  On that platform, on that gantry, and before the man in that black face hood pulls that lever, and your neck snaps at the bottom of that rope, and you're transported to the dimension of your choosing.
[00:40:26.813 --> 00:40:28.454]  We know what you've chosen.
[00:40:28.454 --> 00:40:29.395]  Of your father the devil.
[00:40:30.532 --> 00:40:34.833]  So you want your big bloody communist dream!
[00:40:34.833 --> 00:40:36.114]  And you think it's gonna be so great.
[00:40:36.114 --> 00:40:38.174]  You know, the Red Terror was senseless.
[00:40:38.174 --> 00:40:39.475]  They said, why are we killing random people?
[00:40:39.475 --> 00:40:41.115]  And Lenin said, I want terror!
[00:40:41.115 --> 00:40:42.075]  I want fear!
[00:40:42.075 --> 00:40:45.796]  I want total collapse!
[00:40:45.796 --> 00:40:48.097]  And so let's show you some video here.
[00:40:48.097 --> 00:40:49.498]  This is Aurora yesterday.
[00:40:49.498 --> 00:40:51.218]  There's chopper footage on InfoWars.com.
[00:40:51.218 --> 00:40:52.959]  You see the whole thing.
[00:40:52.959 --> 00:40:53.719]  This is from the ground.
[00:40:53.719 --> 00:40:54.279]  Let's play it with audio.
[00:40:57.338 --> 00:41:05.523]  And they just run out on the highway in a car that doesn't know what's going on and they shoot the tire out and then shoot their own people!
[00:41:05.523 --> 00:41:08.145]  Yeah, is everybody okay over there?
[00:41:08.145 --> 00:41:11.226]  Because you're all such heroes fighting Nazis.
[00:41:11.226 --> 00:41:13.968]  They think they're Captain America and they're funded by George Soros.
[00:41:13.968 --> 00:41:18.171]  I mean, imagine, you pull into this...
[00:41:19.369 --> 00:41:20.450]  And the person panics.
[00:41:20.450 --> 00:41:21.451]  Suddenly they're on the highway.
[00:41:21.451 --> 00:41:23.072]  You see them in the full chopper video.
[00:41:23.072 --> 00:41:24.634]  They're beating one car.
[00:41:24.634 --> 00:41:26.095]  And the person goes, this is scary.
[00:41:26.095 --> 00:41:32.560]  I'm not going to stop with a couple thousand people attacking me.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:33.681]  And so they drive on through.
[00:41:33.681 --> 00:41:42.128]  And then they start shooting at them.
[00:41:42.128 --> 00:41:43.649]  Let's go ahead and go to the next clip.
[00:41:43.649 --> 00:41:46.412]  Colorado driver shot in the head by protester.
[00:41:47.611 --> 00:41:50.633]  And he's a local liberal lawyer activist.
[00:41:50.633 --> 00:41:52.234]  Oh, those loving liberal.
[00:41:52.234 --> 00:41:53.455]  He's got this crazy look.
[00:41:53.455 --> 00:41:57.098]  He's being booked on capital murder.
[00:41:57.098 --> 00:41:59.379]  And he just looks like he just won the lottery.
[00:41:59.379 --> 00:42:02.081]  He's got this pride.
[00:42:02.081 --> 00:42:04.403]  He just ran up to a random car.
[00:42:04.403 --> 00:42:05.303]  It was a white guy.
[00:42:05.303 --> 00:42:06.844]  He shot him in the head.
[00:42:06.844 --> 00:42:07.265]  Here it is.
[00:42:08.387 --> 00:42:16.172]  As in a Colorado Springs hospital, police say he was shot in the head while passing near a George Floyd protest in Alamosa.
[00:42:16.172 --> 00:42:26.298]  Well, Heather, Alamosa police told me that a 27-year-old defense attorney shot a driver in the head during a protest right here on Main Street last night.
[00:42:26.298 --> 00:42:30.901]  Police say this man, 27-year-old James Marshall, was on the streets protesting.
[00:42:30.901 --> 00:42:33.363]  Look how satisfied he is!
[00:42:33.363 --> 00:42:36.825]  By the way, last time I heard that guy shot was on live support.
[00:42:38.069 --> 00:42:39.671]  Is that person even alive?
[00:42:39.671 --> 00:42:51.182]  And you look at the guy, he's been given a mug shot for capital murder and he looks like he's having an orgasm because he believes he'll be released from prison after the communist overthrow and he'll be in a gulag over you and your family.
[00:42:51.182 --> 00:42:52.704]  Sneak again, boy!
[00:42:52.704 --> 00:42:55.386]  Ain't gonna happen!
[00:42:55.386 --> 00:42:56.648]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:43:00.146 --> 00:43:01.586]  It's Christmas in July.
[00:43:01.586 --> 00:43:02.827]  We ran the sale last year.
[00:43:02.827 --> 00:43:04.587]  It was very, very popular.
[00:43:04.587 --> 00:43:10.869]  And so I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election year.
[00:43:10.869 --> 00:43:16.390]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[00:43:16.390 --> 00:43:22.011]  It's the American Eagle, boldly spreading its wings, sitting atop a Betsy Ross flag.
[00:43:22.011 --> 00:43:24.672]  And the shirts are on sale right now at InfoWarstore.com.
[00:43:25.812 --> 00:43:31.937]  I got the idea from the Trump campaign of having a similar sort of media called Nazi, which of course it isn't.
[00:43:31.937 --> 00:43:36.580]  And since it's so triggering to the leftists and the globalists, well, we're going to make sure there's even more of these on the streets.
[00:43:37.423 --> 00:43:37.963]  We're good to go.
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:01.621]  The people are awakening.
[00:44:01.621 --> 00:44:04.343]  They're taking control of their own environment.
[00:44:04.343 --> 00:44:06.405]  Cell phones are an amazing tool.
[00:44:06.405 --> 00:44:08.747]  Really, they're a supercomputer that's handheld.
[00:44:08.747 --> 00:44:18.154]  But big tech, large corporations, hackers, governments, foreign governments, the Chai Coms especially, are using this to steal your data, to share your data.
[00:44:18.394 --> 00:44:26.981]  To be able to rig markets when they're able to scoop up billions of people's data, they can actually predict on record what's going to happen in mass movements.
[00:44:26.981 --> 00:44:33.707]  Cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their AI takeover.
[00:44:33.707 --> 00:44:35.128]  In their own words, they admit it.
[00:44:35.128 --> 00:44:39.572]  Show, I've been selling privacy pouches and locket pockets and things like that for more than a decade.
[00:44:40.032 --> 00:44:41.953]  And now the units have gotten really lightweight.
[00:44:41.953 --> 00:44:43.054]  They're Faraday cages.
[00:44:43.054 --> 00:44:44.715]  They just look like a cloth envelope.
[00:44:44.715 --> 00:44:46.756]  They work absolutely great.
[00:44:46.756 --> 00:44:55.881]  And it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity when you are traveling and don't want Big Brother to know what you're up to because it's none of their business.
[00:44:55.881 --> 00:44:58.303]  Get yours at InfoWarsTore.com today.
[00:45:00.316 --> 00:45:11.126]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history, that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[00:45:11.126 --> 00:45:20.334]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property, because we've had it so long, and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[00:45:20.694 --> 00:45:34.858]  Ladies and gentlemen, the renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[00:45:34.858 --> 00:45:49.062]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be culled and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[00:45:49.522 --> 00:45:51.204]  And that's what COVID-19 is.
[00:45:51.204 --> 00:45:58.091]  A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity, and against your future.
[00:45:58.091 --> 00:45:59.712]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[00:46:05.945 --> 00:46:06.625]  Fair.
[00:46:06.625 --> 00:46:07.125]  Wonderful.
[00:46:07.125 --> 00:46:15.928]  Because an all-seeing, all-loving computer that doesn't discriminate is going to decide who gets what resources, who gets what jobs.
[00:46:15.928 --> 00:46:29.591]  But in reality, it's building a post-human world so that you can be made obsolete, domesticated, dumbed down, drugged, distracted, atomized, and then slowly killed.
[00:46:29.591 --> 00:46:31.672]  This is the brave new world.
[00:46:32.429 --> 00:46:34.030]  It's the post-human world.
[00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:41.075]  It's the dreaming of the post-human world that Wired Magazine and the Wall Street Journal all tell us about.
[00:46:41.075 --> 00:46:44.258]  Oh, now they tell us our smartphones don't just track our every move.
[00:46:44.258 --> 00:46:49.862]  They're monitoring our psychology and sending it back to a corporate database globally.
[00:46:49.862 --> 00:46:53.985]  You see, the bear trap closed on our lead now.
[00:46:53.985 --> 00:46:59.569]  And the vampire walked out of the bushes and is explaining to us how he's slowly gonna bleed us and destroy us.
[00:47:03.263 --> 00:47:15.873]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:15.873 --> 00:47:20.997]  The Civil War isn't coming!
[00:47:20.997 --> 00:47:23.659]  The Civil War is here!
[00:47:23.659 --> 00:47:29.424]  And it's run by the Chi-Coms, the EU, the Globalists, Hollywood, the Democratic Party, and all the big banks!
[00:47:30.879 --> 00:47:39.106]  And that's why all the corporations line up and beg, because they want that free fiat money the central banks give them, that's backed up by who?
[00:47:39.106 --> 00:47:42.829]  By you and I, the taxpayers!
[00:47:42.829 --> 00:47:45.050]  That's how it's all centralized.
[00:47:45.050 --> 00:47:46.892]  How the UN runs our medicine.
[00:47:46.892 --> 00:47:48.653]  How the UN runs our schools.
[00:47:48.653 --> 00:47:50.715]  How all its regulations control us.
[00:47:50.715 --> 00:47:51.716]  Who set up the UN?
[00:47:51.716 --> 00:47:58.061]  The Rockefellers, on record!
[00:47:58.061 --> 00:47:59.302]  A giant spider web.
[00:48:00.521 --> 00:48:02.702]  A new world order.
[00:48:02.702 --> 00:48:04.803]  A big idea.
[00:48:04.803 --> 00:48:06.624]  A post-human future.
[00:48:06.624 --> 00:48:12.787]  But to build that nightmare world, the Renaissance and the liberal West must be pulled down.
[00:48:12.787 --> 00:48:20.031]  No better way to destroy true liberalism than to bring in the left-hand path and destroy free, open societies.
[00:48:20.031 --> 00:48:22.732]  That's why Soros captains the open society.
[00:48:22.732 --> 00:48:24.533]  Everything with him is an inversion.
[00:48:24.533 --> 00:48:26.494]  It's the closed society.
[00:48:26.494 --> 00:48:27.675]  The poor society.
[00:48:28.615 --> 00:48:33.177]  The society under his and other globalist iron rule.
[00:48:33.177 --> 00:48:37.540]  Because they want to dominate your soul.
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:40.081]  They want you to beg for every crime.
[00:48:40.081 --> 00:48:42.302]  They want you to submit to them.
[00:48:42.302 --> 00:48:46.464]  Because they're fallen and ugly and want you to be beneath them.
[00:48:46.464 --> 00:48:48.445]  But you will never be beneath them.
[00:48:48.445 --> 00:48:48.986]  Remember that.
[00:48:48.986 --> 00:48:51.487]  Now let's get into it.
[00:48:52.521 --> 00:48:57.462]  I have countless more videos, but why don't we just show the video, the radio listeners, a few weeks ago.
[00:48:57.462 --> 00:49:04.064]  White supremacist runs over peaceful protester that had run out on the highway, blocked it in a dark area of the road.
[00:49:04.064 --> 00:49:08.585]  Two women, two white women, live streaming, get run over.
[00:49:08.585 --> 00:49:11.145]  They run to attack the guy, start beating his car.
[00:49:11.145 --> 00:49:15.847]  He drives off, they call it a hit and run, until they find out it's a black guy.
[00:49:15.847 --> 00:49:17.627]  And then the whole story got shut down.
[00:49:20.063 --> 00:49:27.686]  But that's what happens here, ladies and gentlemen, when you're out on the highway at 1.30 and somebody that's been out partying comes driving on the road.
[00:49:27.686 --> 00:49:29.047]  And boy, would it have been a white guy?
[00:49:29.047 --> 00:49:31.568]  Woo!
[00:49:31.568 --> 00:49:33.669]  And we'd have pointed out, you know, that it was an accident.
[00:49:33.669 --> 00:49:44.254]  I'd have been sued by a university right there in Seattle, just like I was by Georgetown for pointing out that Soros collided all the people together a few years ago in Virginia.
[00:49:45.151 --> 00:49:47.653]  To create a crisis and one woman got killed.
[00:49:47.653 --> 00:49:51.615]  They're suing me saying I'm saying they actually killed the woman physically themselves.
[00:49:51.615 --> 00:49:53.176]  No, I said like a chemistry set.
[00:49:53.176 --> 00:49:58.099]  You set up the collision and then had the police push them together for the crisis.
[00:49:58.099 --> 00:50:06.224]  And the Democrats are now on record saying in the news, we're going to create explosions all over the US to drive Trump from power.
[00:50:06.224 --> 00:50:10.707]  And they bought full page ads in the New York Times.
[00:50:10.707 --> 00:50:13.329]  While they simultaneously have Frontline coming out.
[00:50:14.633 --> 00:50:18.935]  With a multi-series show of complete fiction.
[00:50:18.935 --> 00:50:21.997]  Because I've talked to people that have been involved in the production.
[00:50:21.997 --> 00:50:23.297]  Unbelievable.
[00:50:23.297 --> 00:50:28.900]  They're actually going to say, I'm told, that Russians fund InfoWars.
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:30.861]  Wonder how much they had to pay people to say that.
[00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:31.922]  Look at this headline.
[00:50:31.922 --> 00:50:41.547]  United States of Conspiracy examines how three men, Alex Jones, Roger Stone, and President Trump,
[00:50:42.472 --> 00:50:51.862]  Helped to lay the foundation for the conspiracy theories to take center stage in America's national conversation.
[00:50:51.862 --> 00:51:01.633]  And on the front page of their Twitter, front page of Frontline, it's me, at the evil Austin rallies against compulsory masks.
[00:51:01.633 --> 00:51:03.575]  How horrible we are.
[00:51:06.872 --> 00:51:10.835]  Here, let's roll some footage of them a few weeks ago attacking an armored vehicle while making jokes.
[00:51:10.835 --> 00:51:11.915]  Why do you have an armored vehicle?
[00:51:11.915 --> 00:51:24.884]  Well, if we're going to go downtown and cover all this, and you're going to come up armed with clubs and hammers and guns and then try to bash the windows out, we need to be able to peacefully show how violent and evil you are.
[00:51:24.884 --> 00:51:29.847]  So the media spun this and said we attacked our own vehicle in a false flag.
[00:51:29.847 --> 00:51:32.388]  And then the media said we put fake bullet holes in the window.
[00:51:32.388 --> 00:51:33.529]  No, it was hammer holes.
[00:51:33.529 --> 00:51:34.050]  They did it.
[00:51:34.050 --> 00:51:34.410]  Antifa.
[00:51:35.908 --> 00:51:41.332]  And then they said that we burned down a homeless camp because Antifa isn't violent.
[00:51:41.332 --> 00:51:41.872]  That's right.
[00:51:41.872 --> 00:51:46.536]  We burned a homeless camp because we shot the footage of them burning the homeless camp.
[00:51:46.536 --> 00:51:49.198]  Uh-huh.
[00:51:49.198 --> 00:51:53.501]  Talk about being conspiracy theorists, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:51:53.501 --> 00:51:57.303]  This is how they operate each and every time.
[00:51:57.303 --> 00:51:59.205]  So Schiff has now joined
[00:52:00.353 --> 00:52:04.596]  Pelosi and the former Attorney General Eric Holder and all the rest of them.
[00:52:04.596 --> 00:52:09.118]  Joe Biden's saying Trump is a dictator.
[00:52:09.118 --> 00:52:13.021]  The federal police guarding courthouses are Nazis.
[00:52:13.021 --> 00:52:19.084]  Why, everybody's a Nazi now except the real Nazi collaborator, George Soros.
[00:52:19.084 --> 00:52:22.326]  Remember just six months ago they had articles going, Jones is insane.
[00:52:22.326 --> 00:52:24.167]  George Soros is a philanthropist.
[00:52:24.167 --> 00:52:26.429]  He doesn't fund Black Lives Matter or Antifa.
[00:52:26.429 --> 00:52:27.690]  Now Soros is proud of this.
[00:52:27.690 --> 00:52:29.771]  He's like, I am doubling my funding.
[00:52:31.926 --> 00:52:36.748]  Hundreds of millions of dollars a year to this.
[00:52:36.748 --> 00:52:44.330]  200 million this year so far to Black Lives Matter and Antifa that we know of.
[00:52:44.330 --> 00:52:54.134]  I'm being sued by a Soros-backed suit, and it says Jones falsely claims that Soros funded Antifa in Charlottesville.
[00:52:54.134 --> 00:52:58.275]  And it's on the damn record, in his own family name, they gave the money.
[00:53:00.723 --> 00:53:04.865]  I mean, this is next level, ladies, but they don't care.
[00:53:04.865 --> 00:53:06.185]  They don't care.
[00:53:06.185 --> 00:53:19.990]  Because they've got systems that will rout us, and they believe shut us down, as if I can't jack into our awesome, incredible supporters and listeners who are loyal to the truth and justice, who will always amplify, as long as they're alive, our message.
[00:53:19.990 --> 00:53:22.771]  And as they try to suppress our message, it only becomes stronger.
[00:53:23.735 --> 00:53:25.217]  Historically.
[00:53:25.217 --> 00:53:27.461]  The Streisand effect is active now.
[00:53:27.461 --> 00:53:28.502]  I'm going to give you some good news.
[00:53:28.502 --> 00:53:30.566]  I'm going to hit this other news.
[00:53:30.566 --> 00:53:31.948]  I took off six days.
[00:53:31.948 --> 00:53:33.089]  I went to the floor to panhandle.
[00:53:34.261 --> 00:53:38.104]  Really Southern Alabama, Southern Georgia, great people, best part of Florida.
[00:53:38.104 --> 00:53:44.329]  And I was mobbed by black people, mobbed by brown people, mobbed by white people, mobbed, mobbed, mobbed.
[00:53:44.329 --> 00:53:46.711]  Everybody in the South's getting along so good.
[00:53:46.711 --> 00:53:49.534]  Folks in the Northeast really ought to go see how it's done.
[00:53:49.534 --> 00:53:50.995]  And I was just mobbed.
[00:53:50.995 --> 00:53:56.360]  I mean, and people were just elect, I know people from Brazil I ran into, Mexico that I ran into.
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.041]  They had loving eyes.
[00:53:58.041 --> 00:54:00.543]  Everybody had loving eyes, was awake, was alive.
[00:54:00.543 --> 00:54:01.284]  I got so many hugs.
[00:54:03.326 --> 00:54:11.229]  And people are just so aware of the whole New World Order and the pedophile rings and the COVID hoax and just all of it.
[00:54:11.229 --> 00:54:16.090]  But still, many of them are nice and are complying because they don't want to ruffle feathers.
[00:54:16.090 --> 00:54:19.131]  No, we have to ruffle feathers and not submit to this tyranny.
[00:54:19.131 --> 00:54:22.292]  Ted Nugent is scheduled to come up.
[00:54:22.292 --> 00:54:24.253]  You know, folks, we are not funded
[00:54:25.848 --> 00:54:27.369]  By the Russians.
[00:54:27.369 --> 00:54:28.750]  I have no connections to the Russians.
[00:54:28.750 --> 00:54:30.631]  That's all been completely disproven.
[00:54:30.631 --> 00:54:32.753]  Roger Stone was not convicted for any connection to the Russians.
[00:54:32.753 --> 00:54:37.356]  He was convicted for trying to get Julian Assange on my show.
[00:54:37.356 --> 00:54:37.936]  Literally.
[00:54:37.936 --> 00:54:45.402]  I mean, I was here when Assange wouldn't give us the time of day and he was trying to talk to Randy Credico and I was mad at Assange calling him Hillary Clinton's butt plug.
[00:54:45.402 --> 00:54:46.702]  Remember all that?
[00:54:46.702 --> 00:54:47.143]  I was here.
[00:54:48.888 --> 00:54:58.176]  But imagine saying, I am this evil Russian, but by doing that they make me an enemy and they could use CIA money and propaganda to try to shut us down and sue us and do all this.
[00:54:58.176 --> 00:55:01.499]  And Trump's never gotten full control of the COG system.
[00:55:01.499 --> 00:55:09.586]  And maybe he'll wake up now with 99 days left because Pelosi's on TV saying, I met with COG last week and we've got a plan to forcibly remove him.
[00:55:09.586 --> 00:55:12.028]  The COG's under the President and Congress.
[00:55:12.028 --> 00:55:14.491]  What were you doing in a meeting without the President there, you monster?
[00:55:15.111 --> 00:55:22.074]  They're openly doing that, though, to look confident in front of everybody, so they'll carry out the damn coup!
[00:55:22.074 --> 00:55:29.137]  Well, the Washington Post says, front page, anyone that doesn't submit to us will serve prison time.
[00:55:29.137 --> 00:55:31.238]  Oh, with antifa jail guards?
[00:55:31.238 --> 00:55:35.840]  You know, I think I'll just go ahead and take my chances fighting.
[00:55:35.840 --> 00:55:38.321]  And that's all I'm going to say.
[00:55:38.321 --> 00:55:40.282]  I guess, oh, I said I'd read this.
[00:55:40.282 --> 00:55:44.524]  I've already lost my Alexander Solzhenitsyn quote.
[00:55:47.210 --> 00:55:48.512]  Let me just say this.
[00:55:48.512 --> 00:55:50.295]  We're funded by you.
[00:55:50.295 --> 00:55:51.997]  If you need water filtration, we've got the best.
[00:55:51.997 --> 00:55:53.099]  The best price you're going to find.
[00:55:53.099 --> 00:55:54.802]  Air filtration, best you're going to find.
[00:55:54.802 --> 00:55:58.768]  At the price, you can pay five times more, get something better, but it's a forced-age ion filter.
[00:55:58.768 --> 00:55:59.749]  Loves the pure breeze.
[00:55:59.749 --> 00:56:01.352]  Loves the pure water filters as well.
[00:56:02.441 --> 00:56:03.981]  Everybody needs to be self-sufficient.
[00:56:03.981 --> 00:56:06.822]  Storeable Food now is shipping within two to three weeks.
[00:56:06.822 --> 00:56:09.823]  I would get it during this low, if you can call it this, and get it in.
[00:56:09.823 --> 00:56:11.663]  Last 25 years, super high quality.
[00:56:11.663 --> 00:56:13.864]  We have the best at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:56:13.864 --> 00:56:15.124]  Partner with MyPatriotSupply.
[00:56:15.124 --> 00:56:17.225]  You get it quickest ordering it from us.
[00:56:17.225 --> 00:56:18.985]  I would take action now on that.
[00:56:18.985 --> 00:56:25.386]  And we have Christmas Comes in July sale that will be ending sometime this week because so many of these items are about to sell out.
[00:56:25.386 --> 00:56:26.907]  Storewide free shipping.
[00:56:26.907 --> 00:56:29.527]  Double Patriot points.
[00:56:29.527 --> 00:56:31.548]  And the sale is going to end within just a few days because
[00:56:33.123 --> 00:56:33.924]  I have to.
[00:56:33.924 --> 00:56:36.868]  The free shipping's killing us, and then also all these items are about to sell out.
[00:56:36.868 --> 00:56:39.751]  Bodies, Ultimate Turmeric Formula, selling out.
[00:56:39.751 --> 00:56:42.154]  Living Defense, 50% off, selling out.

[00:57:00.153 --> 00:57:01.914]  They're telling me, Alex, you've got to launch the new special.
[00:57:01.914 --> 00:57:03.495]  You've got to launch the new product.
[00:57:03.495 --> 00:57:04.677]  And I've just been too busy to do it.
[00:57:04.677 --> 00:57:06.178]  So we're just selling out of all this stuff.
[00:57:06.178 --> 00:57:08.900]  Survival Shield X2 Niacin Iodine Spray.

[00:57:30.418 --> 00:57:31.618]  And so much more.
[00:57:31.618 --> 00:57:33.280]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:33.280 --> 00:57:37.103]  Ted Nugent, the governor said, we'll arrest you if you come to New York.
[00:57:37.103 --> 00:57:38.283]  You don't have speech.
[00:57:38.283 --> 00:57:39.104]  He's coming up.
[00:57:39.104 --> 00:57:41.186]  I mean, the commies are making their move.
[00:57:41.186 --> 00:57:42.487]  Second hour, straight ahead.
[00:57:42.487 --> 00:57:43.487]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:57:43.487 --> 00:57:44.708]  You are the Paul Revere.
[00:57:44.708 --> 00:57:46.149]  Spread the word now.
[00:57:46.149 --> 00:57:46.590]  Do it!
[00:57:46.590 --> 00:57:47.951]  Tell folks to do it now!
[00:57:49.804 --> 00:57:54.988]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at infowarestore.com.
[00:57:54.988 --> 00:57:56.609]  You can wear them out to political events.
[00:57:56.609 --> 00:57:58.170]  You can trigger lib darts.
[00:57:58.170 --> 00:58:05.455]  But one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween.
[00:58:05.455 --> 00:58:11.719]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[00:58:11.719 --> 00:58:17.283]  It's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the forced inoculations and contact tracing of their openly
[00:58:17.645 --> 00:58:17.965]  I think so.
[00:58:28.860 --> 00:58:33.265]  It's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing.
[00:58:33.265 --> 00:58:37.089]  And the M95 mask only controls what's coming in, not what's going out.
[00:58:37.089 --> 00:58:39.171]  So they quote, spread COVID-19.
[00:58:39.171 --> 00:58:40.652]  They don't protect from it.
[00:58:40.652 --> 00:58:43.615]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back in these control freak spaces.
[00:58:43.615 --> 00:58:46.258]  You buy one for $9.95, you get four more free.
[00:58:46.258 --> 00:58:47.259]  They're at cost.
[00:58:47.259 --> 00:58:48.681]  Infowarrestore.com.
[00:58:50.919 --> 00:58:52.960]  You can't make this stuff up.
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:59:13.855]  A consortium of the UNWHO, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and of course the Clinton Global Initiative, headed up by Chelsea Clinton on the board, are in control of Apple and Google with a hidden app on all phones that you cannot turn off to track and trace everywhere you go.
[00:59:13.855 --> 00:59:18.738]  They claim for COVID, but of course it's really the Chinese Communist social score rollout.
[00:59:18.738 --> 00:59:19.239]  These people
[00:59:19.679 --> 00:59:23.586]  Are sick, filthy criminals and they want total control over society.
[00:59:25.951 --> 00:59:26.792]  We're good to go.
[00:59:53.300 --> 01:00:04.391]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.391 --> 01:00:06.313]  Folks, we are back live.
[01:00:06.313 --> 01:00:07.454]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:00:07.454 --> 01:00:09.677]  Ted Nugent's gonna be calling in the next five minutes or so.
[01:00:10.930 --> 01:00:17.452]  And if you just heard me mention, oh, the governor said they'll arrest Ted Nugent and this congressman if they come to New York.
[01:00:17.452 --> 01:00:21.033]  It blocks the quarantine, but Antifa can riot and attack police.
[01:00:21.033 --> 01:00:25.035]  And so they canceled a pro-police rally.
[01:00:25.035 --> 01:00:27.916]  And again, you could go there and, you know, let them come after Ted Nugent.
[01:00:27.916 --> 01:00:31.957]  The point is, is that the organizers shut it down so Ted Nugent didn't go to it.
[01:00:31.957 --> 01:00:34.018]  That's how the communists have us paralyzed.
[01:00:35.265 --> 01:00:36.025]  And that's why the L.A.
[01:00:36.025 --> 01:00:42.149]  Mayor says, oh, it's good of you to protest the police, just no one else can, you know, protest, though, anything else.
[01:00:42.149 --> 01:00:44.151]  Only communists are allowed to protest.
[01:00:44.151 --> 01:00:46.792]  And they're all just teaching you these major contradictions.
[01:00:46.792 --> 01:00:48.834]  This is done in psych warfare.
[01:00:48.834 --> 01:00:51.776]  This is done to train you to accept garbage.
[01:00:51.776 --> 01:00:53.837]  You're not supposed to like it.
[01:00:53.837 --> 01:00:58.420]  You're supposed to learn to accept it, that it's peaceful to run up to you in a car and shoot you in the head.
[01:01:01.055 --> 01:01:08.408]  Now here's a very powerful report, before we go to Ted Nugent, since we're getting, that Gregory's put together called, Everyone Will Soon Test Positive for COVID.
[01:01:08.408 --> 01:01:10.632]  And it shows all the CDC documents.
[01:01:10.632 --> 01:01:11.554]  Well, just see it for yourself.
[01:01:11.554 --> 01:01:12.957]  This is beyond critical, banned on video.
[01:01:15.467 --> 01:01:22.454]  We know that the prescribed PCR tests are not detecting the COVID-19 genome.
[01:01:22.454 --> 01:01:31.002]  According to the CDC's own literature, the tests do not rule out bacterial infection or other viruses.
[01:01:31.002 --> 01:01:38.269]  They are detecting all varieties of coronavirus, including the common cold, and counting it as COVID-19.
[01:01:39.790 --> 01:01:51.361]  And it has been pointed out for months that the geographical locations experiencing the most cases of COVID also seem to have active 5G technology.
[01:01:51.361 --> 01:02:01.211]  After a video went viral in which David Icke suggested that 5G is somehow responsible for positive cases of COVID-19, YouTube deleted it.
[01:02:01.631 --> 01:02:15.772]  And began deleting all videos on the subject, including a video we made that pointed out how on October 31st of 2019, Wuhan, China became the first major testbed of 5G technology.
[01:02:18.379 --> 01:02:28.741]  In late June, a new scientific research paper entitled, 5G Technology and Induction of Coronavirus in Skin Cells was published.
[01:02:28.741 --> 01:02:37.003]  This paper gives a scientific explanation of the relationship between 5G technology and the coronavirus.
[01:02:37.003 --> 01:02:44.925]  Unlike 4G or other radio waves, the 5G millimeter waves can penetrate the nucleus of a cell.
[01:02:45.965 --> 01:02:49.449]  The DNA then acts as an inductor.
[01:02:49.449 --> 01:02:54.695]  It reacts to the 5G waves by producing an electromagnetic field.
[01:02:54.695 --> 01:03:02.845]  Like a shadow, the shape of the electromagnetic field reflects the hexagonal and pentagonal shapes of the DNA base pairs.
[01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:08.710]  This electromagnetic field produces holes in the cellular liquid.
[01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:13.473]  Hexagonal, pentagonal voids are created in the nucleoplasm.
[01:03:13.473 --> 01:03:19.117]  And to remedy this disturbance, extra bases are created to fill the voids.
[01:03:19.117 --> 01:03:29.845]  These bases then join together to produce coronavirus-like structures within the cell, which the PCR test will read as a positive case of COVID-19.
[01:03:33.311 --> 01:03:34.652]  The exosome.
[01:03:34.652 --> 01:03:37.054]  The exosome was discovered in 1983.
[01:03:37.054 --> 01:03:43.739]  Exosomes are created naturally within the cell to clean and repair cellular damage.
[01:03:45.129 --> 01:03:50.570]  Both exosomes and COVID-19 are the same size and shape.
[01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:56.792]  They both have the same ACE2 receptor and they both contain RNA.
[01:03:56.792 --> 01:04:00.633]  Exosomes behave and appear the same as a virus.
[01:04:00.633 --> 01:04:06.054]  Some scientists even claim that the so-called virus is in fact the exosome.
[01:04:07.483 --> 01:04:19.133]  Since the discovery of the exosome, over 200 microbiologists have been murdered, committed suicide, or died in a suspicious manner.
[01:04:19.133 --> 01:04:23.877]  If you question this mystery, you are undoubtedly labeled a conspiracy theorist.
[01:04:25.307 --> 01:04:32.051]  And if you question the current unproven virus theory, you are labeled a science denier.
[01:04:32.051 --> 01:04:47.919]  The only socially acceptable solution that you are allowed to accept is an experimental vaccine that will alter your DNA, which ultimately raises the question, who owns your body?
[01:04:47.919 --> 01:04:51.922]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[01:04:51.922 --> 01:04:54.023]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[01:04:55.546 --> 01:04:58.927]  Coming up, Ted Nugent.
[01:04:58.927 --> 01:05:10.852]  Another part of the Great Awakening that's taking place is people that haven't even been religious or Christian now see how evil is out in the open, how hundreds of churches have been burned in Europe and the U.S.
[01:05:10.852 --> 01:05:14.553]  Hundreds of Christian icons have been burnt and destroyed.
[01:05:14.553 --> 01:05:18.915]  Jesuses have had their heads cut off all over the country, all over the Philippines, all over Europe.
[01:05:19.315 --> 01:05:20.836]  Virgin Mary's are getting torn down.
[01:05:20.836 --> 01:05:22.858]  I mean, crosses are being torn down.
[01:05:22.858 --> 01:05:28.063]  It's absolutely out of control, but people now understand that evil was always real.
[01:05:28.063 --> 01:05:29.324]  It is spiritual.
[01:05:29.324 --> 01:05:34.449]  And it was just waiting to make its move, building beneath the surface, and now it's emerged.
[01:05:34.949 --> 01:05:37.731]  That's why when I ask listeners and viewers for your prayer, I mean it.
[01:05:37.731 --> 01:05:38.632]  I'm praying for America.
[01:05:38.632 --> 01:05:39.713]  I'm praying for you.
[01:05:39.713 --> 01:05:42.835]  And I know the power of prayer is real and God hears it.
[01:05:42.835 --> 01:05:45.838]  We need to come together and pray for an even greater awakening.
[01:05:45.838 --> 01:05:48.239]  Pray for Donald Trump to be protected.
[01:05:48.239 --> 01:05:55.785]  Pray for him to win in a landslide and pray for the people under deception of the globalists to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom.
[01:05:55.785 --> 01:05:56.486]  God bless you all.
[01:05:56.486 --> 01:05:57.667]  Please pray for him for us as well.
[01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:11.009]  Alright, I got a lot of questions for Ted Nugent at this critical time with 99 days out from the election on this Sunday, July 26.
[01:06:11.009 --> 01:06:14.851]  Check it out on the live broadcast.
[01:06:22.958 --> 01:06:26.481]  I went to him just during the one minute break and I said, what do you want to hit first?
[01:06:26.481 --> 01:06:30.225]  He said, everything in our lifetimes has been building towards what is happening now.
[01:06:31.343 --> 01:06:32.964]  This is America fighting for its life.
[01:06:32.964 --> 01:06:39.467]  Ted Nugent joins us to talk about a story that I'm reading out of law enforcement today.
[01:06:39.467 --> 01:06:40.928]  And I went and looked at the local news.
[01:06:40.928 --> 01:06:46.351]  They are proudly announcing that the governor said in New York, you're not allowed to have a pro-police rally.
[01:06:46.351 --> 01:06:48.092]  The state police help, you're fired.
[01:06:48.092 --> 01:06:50.213]  If cops come out, you're fired.
[01:06:50.213 --> 01:06:53.075]  You don't have speech, but the communists, everybody else do.
[01:06:53.675 --> 01:06:54.095]  My pleasure, Alex.
[01:06:54.095 --> 01:06:56.497]  I'm here to celebrate the good, but it's not easy to find right now.
[01:06:56.497 --> 01:06:57.558]  There's an awful lot of bad and ugly.
[01:07:24.216 --> 01:07:47.641]  I really get the unique and humbling experience to maximize the good with the best of the best hard-working American families every day of my life, but I was just returning from New York where another great family spent a fortune to get me and the good congressman Clay Higgins to a pro-law enforcement rally, a pro-law and order rally, the biggest one.
[01:07:47.641 --> 01:07:49.642]  It was purported to be the biggest pro-law
[01:07:50.402 --> 01:07:51.523]  We're good to go.
[01:08:12.535 --> 01:08:19.139]  Have destroyed the morale of the law enforcement sheepdog heroes across this country.
[01:08:19.139 --> 01:08:24.841]  Most heartbreakingly, Alex, we witnessed the great heroes of the New York Police Department.
[01:08:24.841 --> 01:08:26.382]  So we were ready to go.
[01:08:26.382 --> 01:08:28.563]  Like I said, my buddy jetted us up there.
[01:08:28.563 --> 01:08:30.164]  I had the guitar and amp.
[01:08:30.164 --> 01:08:31.325]  We had the good congressmen.
[01:08:31.325 --> 01:08:35.407]  We had great, great law enforcement heroes and their families gathering.
[01:08:35.407 --> 01:08:39.189]  And I literally was threatened by Governor Cuomo.
[01:08:41.838 --> 01:09:07.098]  And his hand-picked Marxist Health Department Nazis, that if I set foot in New York to play the national anthem and thank the law enforcement heroes, if I dare enter his communist New York area, I would be put under house arrest and quarantine for 14 days, thereby destroying the only chance
[01:09:07.665 --> 01:09:16.530]  To have a morale boost by the heroes of the NYPD, and boy are they pissed!
[01:09:16.530 --> 01:09:27.997]  And I'm just speechless at this point, that he literally says, Communists can march, you can attack the police, they beat up the police commissioner, and the news called it peaceful.
[01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:29.698]  I mean, this is crazy!
[01:09:29.698 --> 01:09:36.181]  And then now, you'll be arrested, you'll be placed on house arrest, you'll be kidnapped, if you try to come play the national anthem.
[01:09:36.181 --> 01:09:36.862]  This is next level.
[01:09:37.827 --> 01:09:51.611]  You know, we've known each other a long time, Alex, and we've seen just indescribable, bizarre levels of criminal corruption and abuse of power by every alphabet soup, you know, government bureaucracy.
[01:09:51.611 --> 01:09:54.852]  I mean, who the hell trusts the CDC?
[01:09:54.852 --> 01:09:57.313]  Do you know anybody that trusts the CDC?
[01:09:57.313 --> 01:10:03.275]  How about the James Comey, J. Edgar Hoover, Al Capone FBI punks?
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:12.607]  That obeyed an order to have a commando, brown shirt, Gestapo attack on Roger Stone's house.
[01:10:12.607 --> 01:10:13.027]  Really?
[01:10:13.027 --> 01:10:18.071]  You gotta bring machine guns to arrest Roger Stone?
[01:10:18.071 --> 01:10:20.173]  And here's the horror of it.
[01:10:20.173 --> 01:10:30.122]  These soulless, dickless sheep of the FBI obeyed the immoral order.
[01:10:30.757 --> 01:10:32.460]  That's what's frightening.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:34.143]  Now, I know a bunch of guys in the FBI.
[01:10:34.143 --> 01:10:38.551]  In fact, I went up there to New York with some good heroes of the FBI.
[01:10:38.551 --> 01:10:40.875]  And, God, are they pissed off!
[01:10:41.539 --> 01:10:48.083]  So any alphabet soup bureaucracy in the United States government right now, whether it's the IRS... It's just like America.
[01:10:48.083 --> 01:10:48.664]  It's divided.
[01:10:48.664 --> 01:10:52.326]  It's got the America-hating globalist in it that ran the attempted coup against Trump.
[01:10:52.326 --> 01:10:53.487]  Then it's got the good guys.
[01:10:53.487 --> 01:10:58.750]  But the bad guys are getting more and more control, and we've got to route them because they're not Americans.
[01:10:58.750 --> 01:11:02.233]  The Democrats openly now say they don't want the country to exist.
[01:11:02.233 --> 01:11:05.435]  And so law enforcement and everybody else has to decide, which side are you on?
[01:11:05.435 --> 01:11:06.355]  Are you crazy?
[01:11:06.355 --> 01:11:07.556]  They want to bring the country down.
[01:11:07.556 --> 01:11:08.277]  This is insane!
[01:11:09.042 --> 01:11:16.070]  Yeah, you know, there were six bureaucrats, soulless punks, traitors, yet glaringly guilty of treason.
[01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:26.741]  Their names are Kevin Abrahams, Sila Boyne, Kerry Salagas, Deborah Muell, Ellen Burnham, and Arne Drucker.
[01:11:26.741 --> 01:11:27.582]  They signed
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.081]  A lie.
[01:11:29.081 --> 01:11:31.562]  A hate-stinking lie.
[01:11:31.562 --> 01:11:32.963]  Dig this.
[01:11:32.963 --> 01:11:38.246]  That Ted Nugent is a racist, a homophobe, and an anti-Semite.
[01:11:38.246 --> 01:11:45.811]  You know, I was wondering, Alex, maybe they should have probably talked to some of my black, gay, or Jewish friends before they made those nasty allegations.
[01:11:45.811 --> 01:11:46.792]  They know it's all lies.
[01:11:46.792 --> 01:11:48.513]  They're the ones engaged in race-baiting.
[01:11:48.513 --> 01:11:50.594]  Sure, and here's the thing.
[01:11:50.594 --> 01:11:56.958]  What worse thing can a human do to another human than to falsely accuse
[01:11:57.708 --> 01:12:05.503]  And officially make a government document lying with that level of hate, and they're doing it?
[01:12:06.016 --> 01:12:07.477]  With impunity.
[01:12:07.477 --> 01:12:18.701]  And again, you know, Alex, I gotta tell you, my buddy flew me back home and I got out my bow and arrow and my fishing rod and I spent a wonderful couple days with my dogs on my miraculous paradise here in Texas.
[01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:21.782]  So they didn't hurt Ted Nugent at all.
[01:12:21.782 --> 01:12:22.722]  I mean, are you kidding me?
[01:12:22.722 --> 01:12:24.283]  What can they possibly do to me?
[01:12:24.283 --> 01:12:25.583]  And I'll tell you what, nothing.
[01:12:25.583 --> 01:12:27.304]  But you know what they hurt?
[01:12:27.304 --> 01:12:29.325]  They hurt the spirit
[01:12:29.975 --> 01:12:35.177]  And the morale of the New York Police Department heroes and their families.
[01:12:35.177 --> 01:12:37.498]  Well that's the next thing is, they're open season.
[01:12:37.498 --> 01:12:39.718]  The left wants to brutalize the police.
[01:12:39.718 --> 01:12:42.179]  Not to get rid of them, but to take them over.
[01:12:42.179 --> 01:12:46.161]  Can you imagine the left when the Antifa is now going to have the badges and the guns?
[01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:47.141]  Because that's the goal of this.
[01:12:47.759 --> 01:13:02.327]  You know, I gotta tell you, the leader of the Democrat Party has made it perfectly clear, I mean, in between her felonies, you know, you don't need to read this, you need to sign it, that Nancy Pelosi committed a felony on TV ripping up your and my State of the Union address right there on TV.
[01:13:02.327 --> 01:13:04.648]  And she hasn't been tackled and handcuffed yet.
[01:13:04.648 --> 01:13:05.469]  Historic document, yeah.
[01:13:06.654 --> 01:13:15.179]  She leading the Democrat Party went into a tirade trying to find value and goodness in MS-13!
[01:13:15.179 --> 01:13:19.001]  She said all God's children!
[01:13:19.001 --> 01:13:20.221]  Alex!
[01:13:20.221 --> 01:13:32.527]  What planet are these Democrats and the, by the way, there's no difference between Democrats, Antifa, MS-13, the Jihadists, and the Black Lives Matter.
[01:13:32.527 --> 01:13:35.309]  They're all, they're dedicated to
[01:13:36.328 --> 01:13:40.870]  Well that's my next question for you, and we only got you one more segment here, and I appreciate the time on this Sunday.
[01:13:40.870 --> 01:13:56.797]  The Democrats are now saying, Schiff is now saying, Pelosi, all of them, that Trump's a dictator, and that when, if he challenges the election, that they say they're going to challenge it regardless, if there's like a 2000 argument, that the Pentagon's going to remove Trump, and that anyone that stands with Trump will quote be put in prison.
[01:13:56.797 --> 01:13:58.298]  That's the Washington Post headline.
[01:13:58.298 --> 01:14:00.959]  So they're now planning a hot coup against the President.
[01:14:00.959 --> 01:14:02.200]  How do you think we counter this?
[01:14:03.018 --> 01:14:05.119]  Well, I hope everybody writes this down.
[01:14:05.119 --> 01:14:06.059]  I gotta come back out.
[01:14:06.059 --> 01:14:07.500]  We gotta repeat this.
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:08.980]  Everybody listen.
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:11.862]  HuntTheVote.org.
[01:14:11.862 --> 01:14:13.142]  I'll say it again.
[01:14:13.142 --> 01:14:15.383]  HuntTheVote.org.
[01:14:15.383 --> 01:14:16.844]  You don't have to pay any money.
[01:14:16.844 --> 01:14:18.845]  We already got the money behind it.
[01:14:18.845 --> 01:14:26.908]  You need to register and vote if you believe in God, family, country, Constitution, and freedom.
[01:14:26.908 --> 01:14:28.809]  HuntTheVote.org.
[01:14:28.809 --> 01:14:31.830]  And you gotta get a bunch of other people off their butt to vote.
[01:14:33.188 --> 01:14:36.171]  This revolution will be won on November 3rd, 2020.
[01:14:36.171 --> 01:14:38.954]  HuntTheVote.org.
[01:14:38.954 --> 01:14:44.419]  I'm telling you, it sounds ridiculously simple because it is!
[01:14:44.419 --> 01:14:46.020]  HuntTheVote.org.
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:48.803]  Just register and get to the front lines!
[01:14:48.803 --> 01:14:50.505]  This is the Alamo!
[01:14:50.505 --> 01:14:52.567]  We need to shoot Santa Ana's men!
[01:14:55.151 --> 01:14:55.651]  Absolutely.
[01:14:55.651 --> 01:14:56.332]  We've got to go to break.
[01:14:56.332 --> 01:14:57.132]  We'll do one more segment.
[01:14:57.132 --> 01:15:00.893]  Again, please come back for longer in the week because things are so hot.
[01:15:00.893 --> 01:15:05.795]  With nine days left, we've got 40 seconds to break, but what happens if Trump gets re-elected?
[01:15:05.795 --> 01:15:08.976]  I think he will, but what are they going to do next?
[01:15:08.976 --> 01:15:15.419]  Well, we've seen where the Antifa operates with impunity, and Trump has already
[01:15:16.192 --> 01:15:18.714]  Of mobilizing counter-forces.
[01:15:18.714 --> 01:15:31.862]  You know, how dare the President bring in troops and bring back law and order as the Democrat mayors and governors go, no, no, don't stop the arsonists, don't stop the rioters, don't stop the murderers and the assault.
[01:15:31.862 --> 01:15:37.106]  No, Mr. President, you must let them destroy my city.
[01:15:37.106 --> 01:15:40.128]  I don't know how to process that information.
[01:15:40.128 --> 01:15:44.751]  So what's going to happen is that when we once again prove that God, family, country
[01:15:45.507 --> 01:15:51.955]  wins the election on November 3rd, the savages are going to be corralled and put in cages where they belong.
[01:15:51.955 --> 01:15:52.936]  There's going to be a reckoning.
[01:15:52.936 --> 01:15:53.356]  I agree.
[01:15:53.356 --> 01:15:54.177]  Chad Nugent's our guest.
[01:15:54.177 --> 01:15:54.558]  Stay with us.
[01:15:57.799 --> 01:16:00.760]  I know what we'll do to make them conform to our cult.
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:03.282]  We'll all tell them to wear masks or they're gonna die.
[01:16:03.282 --> 01:16:09.344]  And then we'll release the pressure for a while, then bring it back and squeeze it harder, and release it again, and we'll be the virtue-signalers.
[01:16:09.344 --> 01:16:14.087]  We'll be the angels, even though our lord and master Bill Gates helped fund the whole COVID-19, oh.
[01:16:14.087 --> 01:16:14.327]  No!
[01:16:14.327 --> 01:16:15.887]  Don't Sedukey me!
[01:16:19.389 --> 01:16:29.281]  That's right, that's the code word for Bill Gates' operation he carries out with his good little buddy Dr. Fauci in the surgeon cult.
[01:16:29.281 --> 01:16:35.588]  As you know for girls there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance novels.
[01:16:35.588 --> 01:16:37.871]  One of them is the vampire, the werewolf, the
[01:16:38.371 --> 01:16:41.334]  Psychopaths are so hot.
[01:16:41.334 --> 01:16:41.614]  Oh yeah.
[01:16:58.089 --> 01:17:01.934]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:17:01.934 --> 01:17:06.640]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:11.807]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[01:17:11.807 --> 01:17:12.889]  And I feel fine.
[01:17:14.028 --> 01:17:18.650]  It's the end of the world as we know it, and I don't feel fine.
[01:17:18.650 --> 01:17:29.673]  This entire takeover has been battle-planned, blueprinted, war-gamed, field-martialed by the psychological war chiefs at the United Nations and the Fortune 100.
[01:17:29.673 --> 01:17:31.774]  This is the post-human takeover.
[01:17:31.774 --> 01:17:35.455]  The noose gets tighter when you comply, not looser.
[01:17:36.255 --> 01:17:39.258]  The entire COVID-19 operation is a hoax.
[01:17:39.258 --> 01:17:44.544]  Now they admit that, quote, death numbers are dropping because those are fake, where they count people that died of something else.
[01:17:44.544 --> 01:17:46.346]  But it's all about how many cases there are.
[01:17:46.346 --> 01:17:50.170]  And now they're saying most of the population will get it.
[01:17:50.170 --> 01:17:52.693]  And then no one can go outside ever again.
[01:17:52.693 --> 01:17:54.835]  It's totally insane.
[01:17:54.835 --> 01:17:55.977]  It's a fraud.
[01:17:55.977 --> 01:17:56.858]  It's all a lie.
[01:17:58.959 --> 01:18:10.525]  Vicki Gibbs, 57-year-old lesbian preacher in Houston, went in with a cough, got intubated, and then died.
[01:18:10.525 --> 01:18:15.868]  And as soon as I saw her face, as soon as I saw the report, I said, watch, it'll be intubation.
[01:18:15.868 --> 01:18:17.189]  We know what's gonna happen.
[01:18:17.189 --> 01:18:18.590]  It's a blue city.
[01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:19.811]  Same story yet again.
[01:18:19.811 --> 01:18:21.792]  And they say her heart gave out.
[01:18:22.772 --> 01:18:27.635]  If you put somebody on a breathing tube of COVID-19 as a death sentence, it's on record.
[01:18:27.635 --> 01:18:30.357]  Warn everyone you know before they go into the hospital and get killed.
[01:18:30.357 --> 01:18:33.939]  Why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities and blue states?
[01:18:33.939 --> 01:18:40.903]  It's because they intubate them, putting a tube in their lungs, and COVID-19 is causing an autoimmune response.
[01:18:40.903 --> 01:18:45.026]  And if you do that with oxygen, the doctors are on record saying it will kill you.
[01:18:45.686 --> 01:18:50.333]  But all these doctors in blue cities and blue states follow their orders.

[01:20:00.814 --> 01:20:03.437]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:25.741 --> 01:20:26.282]  Yeah.
[01:20:38.109 --> 01:20:42.234]  Well, there is Ted Nugent years ago on Fox News playing with Star Spangled Banner.
[01:20:42.234 --> 01:20:45.858]  Now the NFL's talking about getting rid of it entirely and the American flag's bad.
[01:20:45.858 --> 01:20:52.366]  Ted Nugent, this is an attempt to overthrow the country and you told me before it went on air that this is the moment of history.
[01:20:52.366 --> 01:20:54.228]  This is the attempt to take down the country.
[01:20:54.228 --> 01:20:55.249]  Can you elaborate on that?
[01:20:55.249 --> 01:20:57.912]  And then you were talking off-air to me about how angry you are about...
[01:20:58.888 --> 01:20:58.948]  The
[01:21:30.389 --> 01:21:38.895]  Well, Alex, I think I have a reasonable and accurate overview of what we have here in the United States of America in 2020.
[01:21:38.895 --> 01:21:44.760]  I was born in Detroit in 1948 when it was universally known as the Arsenal of Democracy.
[01:21:44.760 --> 01:21:47.902]  A lot of people don't know that because they went to school in America.
[01:21:47.902 --> 01:21:51.745]  But Detroit was the Arsenal of Democracy!
[01:21:51.745 --> 01:21:56.689]  And the way the Nugent family conducts our life, we continue in our homes to be the Arsenal of Democracy.
[01:21:56.689 --> 01:21:57.409]  But I was there in 67.
[01:21:58.832 --> 01:22:04.340]  When all my buddies, all my black musician friends, we always jam together and collaborate.
[01:22:04.340 --> 01:22:06.123]  We always hung out together.
[01:22:06.123 --> 01:22:11.391]  And I had friends of every imaginable ethnicity and color and creed and walk of life.
[01:22:11.391 --> 01:22:11.772]  And then in 67,
[01:22:13.365 --> 01:22:15.046]  They burnt down the city.
[01:22:15.046 --> 01:22:20.389]  The rioters went berserk and burnt down their own city, this beautiful architecture.
[01:22:20.389 --> 01:22:27.572]  So I have a good perspective of the goodwill and the positive brotherhood that existed amongst all of us in Detroit.
[01:22:27.572 --> 01:22:33.275]  And then a lunatic fringe segment went nuts, much like precursors to Antipa Ven.
[01:22:33.275 --> 01:22:37.437]  I was in Los Angeles in 92 when the Rodney King verdict came in.
[01:22:37.437 --> 01:22:38.878]  And once again, the idiots
[01:22:39.491 --> 01:22:46.718]  Committed cultural suicide and destroyed their own neighborhoods and lives and viciously attacked and murdered people.
[01:22:46.718 --> 01:22:54.887]  So what I'm seeing today, it breaks my heart to admit, but it's bigger and worse and uglier and more evil.
[01:22:54.887 --> 01:23:02.054]  And it's best presented by the propaganda ministry of the network
[01:23:03.371 --> 01:23:07.973]  News, state and network, television stations, and pretty much all of them except Fox.
[01:23:07.973 --> 01:23:12.494]  And Fox is no angel, believe me, but compared to the rest of them, they almost appear to be.
[01:23:12.494 --> 01:23:19.417]  But I watched CBS this morning where they showed, you know, with this harsh accusation against the troops going after rioters.
[01:23:19.417 --> 01:23:22.698]  You know, only they called them peaceful protesters.
[01:23:23.138 --> 01:23:33.105]  Peaceful protesters don't destroy buildings, they don't have Molotov cocktails, they don't kill retired cops, and they don't wear helmets and have weapons on them.
[01:23:33.105 --> 01:23:34.866]  That's not a peaceful protest.
[01:23:34.866 --> 01:23:38.048]  But the way the propaganda ministry twists it,
[01:23:38.488 --> 01:23:56.864]  If you're dumb enough, and if you're stoned or drunk enough, or just mentally deranged enough, I suppose you can buy into that Antifa might actually be anti-fascist when they actually are the fascists, and Black Lives Matter has absolutely nothing to do with black lives!
[01:23:58.496 --> 01:24:04.401]  And by the way, while you're talking, we're showing footage from just two days ago of them burning the outside of the courthouse.
[01:24:04.401 --> 01:24:06.222]  There's even more dramatic footage.
[01:24:06.222 --> 01:24:07.323]  I mean, this is crazy.
[01:24:07.323 --> 01:24:14.029]  And I have video after video of them randomly running out on highways and shooting at random vehicles.
[01:24:14.029 --> 01:24:18.753]  I have footage of them jumping on an old lady's car, trying to pull her out of the car in Austin last night.
[01:24:18.973 --> 01:24:20.877]  And the media says this is good!
[01:24:20.877 --> 01:24:24.022]  A bunch of thugs attacking old ladies!
[01:24:24.022 --> 01:24:25.886]  What in the hell has happened to the left?
[01:24:25.886 --> 01:24:27.589]  They have gone completely crazy!
[01:24:27.589 --> 01:24:28.911]  Or were they always this nuts?
[01:24:30.154 --> 01:24:41.607]  They've always been this much, but it's reached a new peak because of the tolerance to their escalating danger, their escalating insanity, their escalating corruption, their escalating criminality.
[01:24:41.607 --> 01:24:48.756]  And again, you've got the Speaker of the House committing felonies on TV and trying to find worth and loving value in MS-13.
[01:24:50.157 --> 01:25:01.341]  That's a green light and an open door to go ahead and be as nasty and rotten and dangerous and evil as you want to be because the Democrats, we got your back.
[01:25:01.341 --> 01:25:03.382]  Antifa, we're with you.
[01:25:03.382 --> 01:25:11.846]  And if that doggone President Trump tries to stop you from burning down the city, we're going to try to stop him because we like it when you burn down the city.
[01:25:11.846 --> 01:25:18.168]  So, and again, what they said about me being a racist and a homophobe and an anti-Semite,
[01:25:18.835 --> 01:25:22.918]  Alex, I've been surrounded by blacks and Jews my entire life.
[01:25:22.918 --> 01:25:24.259]  They own every record company.
[01:25:24.259 --> 01:25:25.159]  They're my producers.
[01:25:25.159 --> 01:25:25.860]  They're my friends.
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:27.161]  They're my musicians.
[01:25:27.161 --> 01:25:28.602]  They're my promoters.
[01:25:28.602 --> 01:25:30.783]  They're my bandmates.
[01:25:30.783 --> 01:25:35.647]  It's unbelievable the depth of dishonesty and hate.
[01:25:35.647 --> 01:25:38.168]  And once again, I'm going to read their names up in New York.
[01:25:38.168 --> 01:25:39.009]  They are just
[01:25:39.625 --> 01:25:40.346]  Evil.
[01:25:40.346 --> 01:25:58.688]  Kevin Abrahams and Sila Boyne, Terry Sullivan, Deborah Muell, Ellen Burnham, and Arne Drucker lied and falsely accused me of those nasty conditions while they continue with their support for arson, murder, assault,
[01:25:59.388 --> 01:26:03.033]  Well, last time you were on your wife, she's absolutely right.
[01:26:18.513 --> 01:26:23.594]  In these times, we've got to stay focused and just appreciate God and family and not get too upset.
[01:26:23.594 --> 01:26:30.776]  I get too upset, and I know it upsets you, but at a certain point, those of us that have been upset have been holding back the total takeover.
[01:26:30.776 --> 01:26:37.658]  I think a lot of people that have been on the fence now know that this New World Order takeover, this Communist takeover is real, but they're wondering, what can they do?
[01:26:37.658 --> 01:26:38.959]  Well, go vote.
[01:26:38.959 --> 01:26:39.999]  Register others to vote.
[01:26:40.319 --> 01:26:41.200]  Speak out.
[01:26:41.200 --> 01:26:42.080]  Stand up.
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:43.601]  Run for office locally.
[01:26:43.601 --> 01:26:44.662]  Go to your city council.
[01:26:44.662 --> 01:26:46.803]  Speak out against Antifa and BLM.
[01:26:46.803 --> 01:26:49.064]  All of us have to have our voices heard.
[01:26:49.064 --> 01:26:50.365]  Call into talk radio.
[01:26:50.365 --> 01:26:51.506]  Call into C-SPAN.
[01:26:51.506 --> 01:26:55.388]  Call to your members of Congress and tell them that you support law and order.
[01:26:55.388 --> 01:26:58.770]  It's really just all of us, the silent majority, have to stop being silent.
[01:26:58.770 --> 01:26:59.891]  Is that accurate, Ted Nugent?
[01:27:00.251 --> 01:27:17.118]  That's 100% the dream of the Founding Fathers, that this is an experiment in self-government where every American has a moral and spiritual obligation to be engaged in the process of determining who will represent we the people CONSTITUTIONALLY!
[01:27:17.671 --> 01:27:32.319]  The pillars of God, family, country, individual freedoms from God, if you don't hammer that home to your elected employees, and if you don't vote for God, family, and country, then the Antifa thinks you're one of them!
[01:27:32.319 --> 01:27:33.560]  That's how nasty it is!
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:45.286]  I have a Monday and Thursday night Ted Nugent spirit campfire every week as I broadcast on my Facebook and all over social media, but my God, after this debacle by Cuomo and all the liberal
[01:27:46.448 --> 01:27:52.081]  Uh, Democrat Antifa, MS-13, Black Lives Matter terrorists in New York.
[01:27:52.785 --> 01:28:07.373]  The real heartbreak are those heroes of law enforcement and the NYPD and their families who feel spat upon, who feel bludgeoned by the people in charge because they're the Cuomos and the de Blasios and the Health Department.
[01:28:07.373 --> 01:28:14.657]  And even the upper echelon, the police commissioner and some of the Police Benevolent Association turncoats.
[01:28:14.657 --> 01:28:20.300]  They've turned on the men and women of the NYPD, and it's, Alex, it's in almost every
[01:28:21.721 --> 01:28:22.121]  That's right.
[01:28:22.121 --> 01:28:32.106]  They've sided with the globalist takeover because they think America's done and they've sided with the wrong side and good police officers have to stay in there because they want to run you out.
[01:28:32.106 --> 01:28:33.147]  They want to have a takeover.
[01:28:33.147 --> 01:28:36.408]  TedNugent.com is also a place to find everything Ted Nugent.
[01:28:36.408 --> 01:28:41.251]  Ted, join us soon in the next few weeks as all this develops because there's so much to talk about.
[01:28:41.251 --> 01:28:42.551]  I'm sure you can go on for another hour.
[01:28:42.551 --> 01:28:44.772]  Thank you so much and say hi to your family for me.
[01:28:44.772 --> 01:28:45.092]  Thanks.
[01:28:45.092 --> 01:28:46.933]  HuntTheVote.org everybody.
[01:28:46.933 --> 01:28:48.034]  God bless real America.
[01:28:48.396 --> 01:28:49.036]  God bless you.
[01:28:49.036 --> 01:28:58.320]  There goes Ted Nugent, banned from New York by Cuomo, but commies and antifa, they can do whatever the hell they want.
[01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:13.706]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years, and if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict,
[01:29:14.346 --> 01:29:15.166]  We're good to go.
[01:29:34.272 --> 01:29:38.254]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up.
[01:29:38.254 --> 01:29:43.496]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents.
[01:29:43.496 --> 01:29:51.299]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[01:29:51.299 --> 01:29:55.180]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[01:29:55.180 --> 01:29:58.862]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[01:29:58.862 --> 01:30:01.703]  We are selling more privacy pockets.
[01:30:03.387 --> 01:30:14.736]  We were previously selling in a month because of the Clinton Foundation running the contact tracing and admittedly with Google and Apple tracking all Americans on their phones even if you opt out of it or get rid of the apps.
[01:30:14.736 --> 01:30:29.388]  People realize these criminal groups are surveilling you and selling your data and using it to control your life, sharing it with Antifa, sharing it with Black Lives Matter, sharing it with the deep state to oppress not just high-profile people but the general public.
[01:30:29.388 --> 01:30:31.830]  That's why folks are taking back control of their lives.
[01:30:32.150 --> 01:30:41.297]  We have these little Faraday cages that you can put your cell phones in that knock out the ability of the cell towers to ping it every few seconds and track your location.
[01:30:41.297 --> 01:30:46.861]  This is the only way to have your privacy and people are taking their privacy back and it's very, very exciting.
[01:30:46.861 --> 01:30:50.604]  They're at $19.95 a piece at InfoWareStore.com.

[01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:12.287]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[01:31:12.287 --> 01:31:17.331]  That's why InfoWars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula.

[01:33:01.838 --> 01:33:04.441]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.539 --> 01:33:25.243]  This is the Alex Jones Show, because there is a war on for your mind.
[01:33:25.243 --> 01:33:33.967]  Can you believe how we've been trained to not leave our houses when we're told, wear a mask even though it's all a fraud?
[01:33:33.967 --> 01:33:40.830]  And then I was watching a Joe Rogan clip yesterday, because it was all over the news, Joe Rogan's moving to Texas.
[01:33:40.830 --> 01:33:43.511]  You know, I told you that a couple months ago, remember?
[01:33:43.511 --> 01:33:45.852]  And of course, Joe won't say where he's moving in Texas.
[01:33:48.407 --> 01:33:53.010]  He's, I guess, lengthening out the announcement that he's already moved to Texas.
[01:33:53.010 --> 01:33:56.151]  But, oh wait, I'm just joking.
[01:33:56.151 --> 01:33:59.493]  And I wonder where he moved in Texas.
[01:33:59.493 --> 01:34:06.377]  But, uh, I don't know, Spotify went completely crazy when Joe told me I could say all that stuff.
[01:34:06.377 --> 01:34:13.021]  Then I kind of elaborated on it and kind of added some hyperbole, probably.
[01:34:13.021 --> 01:34:17.524]  Because, you know, I took what Joe said as, wow, he's standing up to YouTube, standing up to censors.
[01:34:19.193 --> 01:34:30.838]  The stuff he told me, but I'm not going to pontificate on that right now, because it's part of a larger story that I want to hit at the start of the next segment.
[01:34:30.838 --> 01:34:39.242]  But I will play the clip of Joe talking about moving to Texas, because then he and his guests talk about, you know, is COVID really bad?
[01:34:39.242 --> 01:34:43.464]  And the New York Times guy's like, oh, Texas is now wearing masks because they figured out they were wrong.
[01:34:43.464 --> 01:34:44.664]  It's really bad.
[01:34:44.664 --> 01:34:48.306]  No, there are past laws with $2,000 fines in places like Austin, if you know.
[01:34:49.346 --> 01:34:59.674]  People are also online going, why does Jones sell a COVID mask with InfoWars on it if he doesn't think it's real?
[01:34:59.674 --> 01:35:01.176]  Well, A, I do believe it's real.
[01:35:01.176 --> 01:35:02.237]  We pioneered exposing it.
[01:35:02.237 --> 01:35:03.618]  It was man-made.
[01:35:03.618 --> 01:35:06.820]  It's meant to infect everyone so you can all be suspect.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:10.163]  And so Bill Gates can patent a vaccine to bring you.
[01:35:10.163 --> 01:35:12.445]  And that's all being confirmed now.
[01:35:12.445 --> 01:35:15.948]  And if you've got to wear the mask, have an InfoWars.com on it.
[01:35:17.256 --> 01:35:24.259]  So you can educate people and use their own suppression they're using against you on them.
[01:35:24.259 --> 01:35:40.545]  But the reason I'm kicking this to the last segment is I forgot to tell the great crew that's been putting up with me tonight to find some clips of Sharia police in Saudi Arabia or in Iran, Shiite and Sunni.
[01:35:40.545 --> 01:35:43.606]  There's footage everywhere of Burqa police.
[01:35:44.707 --> 01:35:49.110]  Or hijab police arresting women that aren't wearing face coverings.
[01:35:49.110 --> 01:35:54.835]  And then we've got footage of people being arrested or ticketed for not wearing masks or not wearing it correctly.
[01:35:54.835 --> 01:35:59.538]  There's always more, more, more they want to get your submissions.
[01:35:59.538 --> 01:36:06.003]  So, literally, Fauci is the hijab burqa police.
[01:36:06.003 --> 01:36:12.488]  So we'll get some of those clips together and then I'll respond to what Joe Rogan's guest had to say coming up next segment.
[01:36:14.219 --> 01:36:15.480]  Joe is bucking the mask.
[01:36:15.480 --> 01:36:17.501]  He knows it's a bunch of bull.
[01:36:17.501 --> 01:36:18.962]  He knows the virus is way overblown.
[01:36:18.962 --> 01:36:25.966]  I had a long talk with him a few weeks ago, but I'm going to leave it at that.
[01:36:25.966 --> 01:36:29.908]  But Joe is very influential, and so I'd like to educate his listeners.
[01:36:29.908 --> 01:36:36.572]  And when we do respond to Joe, I just want to show that it goes viral, and so I can kind of piggyback on there and educate some people before it's too late.
[01:36:36.572 --> 01:36:38.353]  So that's coming up next segment.
[01:36:38.353 --> 01:36:40.574]  But let me hit this right now, since I said I would do it.
[01:36:43.188 --> 01:36:51.732]  And maybe we'll take this little clip and put it at the end of the segment when we put out the last segment of the last hour where I was talking about this.
[01:36:51.732 --> 01:37:06.338]  Alexander Solzhenitsyn was sent for many, many years to a frozen slave camp, what he called the Gulag Archipelago and the little islands all across the frozen tundra landscape.
[01:37:06.338 --> 01:37:11.460]  And he came out and wrote a best-selling book titled Gulag
[01:37:12.699 --> 01:37:16.261]  Archipelago.
[01:37:16.261 --> 01:37:25.626]  And here is a quote from the Google Archipelago, 1918 to 1956.
[01:37:25.626 --> 01:37:38.413]  And how we burned in the camps later, thinking what would things have been like if every security operative, when he went out at night to make an arrest, had been uncertain whether he would return alive.
[01:37:39.301 --> 01:37:39.501]  I think?
[01:37:49.025 --> 01:38:10.892]  People had not simply sat there in their lairs, pawling with care at every bang on the downstairs door, at every step on the staircase, but had understood they had nothing left to lose and had boldly set up in the downstairs hall an ambush of half a dozen people with axes, hammers, pokers, or whatever else they had.
[01:38:10.892 --> 01:38:11.452]  The organs
[01:38:12.639 --> 01:38:24.630]  would very quickly have suffered a shortage of officers and transport, and notwithstanding all of Stalin's thirst, the curse machine would have ground to a halt.
[01:38:24.630 --> 01:38:36.120]  If, if we didn't love freedom enough, and even more, we had no awareness of the real situation, we purely and simply deserve everything that happened afterward.
[01:38:40.802 --> 01:38:44.746]  Now that's when the commies came in and took over the government with rioters and burning.
[01:38:44.746 --> 01:38:47.469]  And then they got the government, the police and military to capitulate.
[01:38:47.469 --> 01:38:50.231]  Okay, you're the boss!
[01:38:50.231 --> 01:38:51.473]  And then they took over Moscow.
[01:38:51.473 --> 01:38:54.476]  It took them two years to take over, really five years the rest of the country.
[01:38:54.476 --> 01:38:56.738]  And then they just started raping and killing and murdering.
[01:38:56.738 --> 01:39:00.642]  And they're modeling all of it off of this and what Mao did in China.
[01:39:03.331 --> 01:39:08.692]  And Kim Jong-un and his father and grandfather, they set up the same system.
[01:39:08.692 --> 01:39:11.573]  And Xi Jinping denounced his own father.
[01:39:11.573 --> 01:39:14.694]  His sister was beaten to death in front of him by a youth brigade.
[01:39:14.694 --> 01:39:16.874]  He praised it.
[01:39:16.874 --> 01:39:25.676]  And so now he runs the country because he literally sacrificed his family, who were good people, for nothing to worship communism.
[01:39:28.936 --> 01:39:31.818]  Because his father had been a communist and helped get them in power.
[01:39:31.818 --> 01:39:33.080]  He was like the number three in the government.
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:34.881]  But he said, let's not murder all the farmers.
[01:39:34.881 --> 01:39:35.922]  Let's not kill the family.
[01:39:35.922 --> 01:39:41.707]  And Mao Zedong said, I'm taking orders from the Rockefellers.
[01:39:41.707 --> 01:39:44.189]  We're going to kill a large portion of our people.
[01:39:44.189 --> 01:39:46.331]  That's the deal.
[01:39:46.331 --> 01:39:47.752]  And so, you know, the rest of the story.
[01:39:47.752 --> 01:39:50.855]  And now ZZ Pink sits on top of it because he's one evil monster.
[01:39:52.486 --> 01:39:58.651]  He took part multiple times in pilloring his father after he spent a decade in a forced labor camp.
[01:39:58.651 --> 01:40:02.114]  And they would do public humiliations when his father came back.
[01:40:02.114 --> 01:40:06.037]  And Xi Jinping would scream and yell and throw things at his father in front of everyone.
[01:40:06.037 --> 01:40:10.540]  And the little 12-year-old girls would run up and spit on him and throw rocks on him.
[01:40:10.540 --> 01:40:14.904]  And Xi Jinping would sit there and denounce his father.
[01:40:14.904 --> 01:40:18.747]  That's the type of trash.
[01:40:18.747 --> 01:40:19.727]  That's Xi Jinping.
[01:40:19.727 --> 01:40:21.469]  He lives on his knees to Satan.
[01:40:22.455 --> 01:40:30.879]  And so he's rewarded with being able to kill his own people en masse and spin up that virus with Fauci and all the rest of it.
[01:40:30.879 --> 01:40:40.664]  So when we come back, I'm going to respond to what's really going on with the mask and the hijab.
[01:40:40.664 --> 01:40:45.086]  Because that's all any of this is, is a burqa.
[01:40:45.086 --> 01:40:46.186]  And this is a submission.
[01:40:46.186 --> 01:40:47.047]  What does Islam mean?
[01:40:47.047 --> 01:40:47.487]  Submission.
[01:40:49.184 --> 01:40:52.046]  Separately, ladies and gentlemen, we've got a solution to tyranny.
[01:40:52.046 --> 01:40:55.909]  It's only one part of the overall solution, and it funds the InfoWarp.
[01:40:55.909 --> 01:41:00.713]  These privacy pockets I have are almost 100% effective.
[01:41:00.713 --> 01:41:01.454]  We've tested them out.
[01:41:01.454 --> 01:41:03.015]  They're one of the best units out there.
[01:41:03.015 --> 01:41:10.081]  Sometimes right up next to a cell tower, it'll still penetrate through and be able to ping your cell phone, track your location, steal your data.
[01:41:10.081 --> 01:41:11.102]  Stop Bill Clinton.
[01:41:12.617 --> 01:41:24.464]  And Hillary Clinton and their global initiative with the NIH and the UNWHO running the contact tracers or beta testing in blue cities that are going to come to force inoculations as early as next year.
[01:41:24.464 --> 01:41:25.584]  They've already got your data.
[01:41:25.584 --> 01:41:28.346]  The apps are already on your phone whether you take them off or not.
[01:41:28.346 --> 01:41:31.728]  Google and Apple admit they're doing it together four months ago.
[01:41:31.728 --> 01:41:33.189]  Everything is tracked.
[01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:36.911]  And so when you put your phone in this, it's a way to control it.
[01:41:36.911 --> 01:41:38.972]  It's a way to not let it run your life.
[01:41:40.342 --> 01:41:43.726]  It's a way to not let it dominate you, and it slips right in your pocket.
[01:41:43.726 --> 01:41:45.548]  It's a thin Faraday cage.
[01:41:45.548 --> 01:41:51.774]  They have units out there that are similar to this one or the same unit they're selling for $35 online.
[01:41:51.774 --> 01:41:56.059]  Amazon sells them for like $22, and you know they always try to have the lowest price.
[01:41:56.059 --> 01:41:56.399]  $19.95.
[01:41:56.399 --> 01:41:57.781]  These cost us almost $12 a piece.
[01:41:59.226 --> 01:42:05.709]  So the $8 comes in to fund our operation, but I want you to get these and get in the habit to think about how evil these cell phones are.
[01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:09.331]  Now they're Trojan horses and how they literally spy on us and control us.
[01:42:09.331 --> 01:42:13.954]  And then start thinking about the features and the functions and how even when you turn off the tracking, it's still doing it.
[01:42:13.954 --> 01:42:14.874]  That's admitted.
[01:42:14.874 --> 01:42:20.097]  So you take control, except when you want to use the phone or take photos or do something, then it makes you think about
[01:42:20.962 --> 01:42:21.783]  I'm being tracked.
[01:42:21.783 --> 01:42:23.023]  I'm being controlled.
[01:42:23.023 --> 01:42:23.984]  They lied to me about that.
[01:42:23.984 --> 01:42:25.345]  They now admit it.
[01:42:25.345 --> 01:42:26.166]  Give it to your children.
[01:42:26.166 --> 01:42:27.126]  Give it to your wife, your husband.
[01:42:27.126 --> 01:42:28.207]  Give them people your work.
[01:42:28.207 --> 01:42:34.872]  And say, hey, when you want to be tracked and followed and when you want to have location services on, you go ahead and take it out of the bag.
[01:42:34.872 --> 01:42:39.415]  But when you want to take control of Big Brother and at least take some ground back from the enemy,
[01:42:41.127 --> 01:42:45.091]  You put the cell phone in the prison it needs to be in, in the Phantom Zone.
[01:42:45.091 --> 01:42:48.794]  Infowarsstore.com, the best price, the highest quality units.
[01:42:48.794 --> 01:42:50.675]  $19.95 with your privacy pockets.
[01:42:50.675 --> 01:42:51.696]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:51.696 --> 01:42:52.137]  Stay with us.
[01:42:58.533 --> 01:43:14.076]  CNN, USA Today, and other mainstream media fake news outlets came out and said that a new Trump campaign t-shirt that has an American eagle spreading its wings standing on top of an American flag is Nazi!
[01:43:14.076 --> 01:43:21.558]  And they had the Soros-funded Snopes groups and others fact-check it and say, yes, now the American flag and yes, the American eagle are Nazi.
[01:43:21.958 --> 01:43:26.201]  No, George Soros that funds Snopes and Media Matters and the rest of them.
[01:43:26.201 --> 01:43:28.643]  He's the real Nazi collaborator.
[01:43:28.643 --> 01:43:31.685]  But, this shirt I think is really the perfect campaign shirt.
[01:43:31.685 --> 01:43:34.487]  We've made one even better than what Trump's people came up with.
[01:43:34.487 --> 01:43:37.068]  Two different versions of it, with something even worse.
[01:43:37.068 --> 01:43:38.689]  The Betsy Ross flag.
[01:43:38.689 --> 01:43:43.513]  Our first flag that they also say is racist, even though she was a famous abolitionist.
[01:43:43.513 --> 01:43:46.254]  So, these shirts are at Infowars.com.
[01:43:46.254 --> 01:43:48.996]  They're the American Eagle, Betsy Ross flags.
[01:43:48.996 --> 01:43:51.258]  Two different designs, guaranteed to spread the word,
[01:43:51.978 --> 01:44:01.081]  Ultra 12 is already our overall number one bestseller.
[01:44:01.081 --> 01:44:14.466]  Ultra 12 is twice as strong as Secret 12 for an even lower price because I signed a huge multi-year contract to guarantee to buy a ton of it and my bet ended up to be successful so far.
[01:44:15.046 --> 01:44:17.129]  Folks are ordering it in mass.
[01:44:17.129 --> 01:44:18.710]  They're getting great responses.
[01:44:18.710 --> 01:44:25.999]  They're giving us incredible reviews because we know what vitamin B12 of this type does, taken out of the tongue, where it's more absorbable.
[01:44:25.999 --> 01:44:30.004]  It supports healthy nerve and brain cells, helps make DNA, help
[01:44:30.464 --> 01:44:37.167]  The body produce more energy, help produce healthy blood cells, essential for proper nervous system function, and so much more.
[01:44:37.167 --> 01:44:44.430]  You can take all the energy drinks and they won't do anything if you don't have the basics already in your body, like vitamin B12.
[01:44:44.430 --> 01:44:52.474]  Whether you're old, whether you're young, whether you're black, whether you're white, whether you live in Japan or the United States, Ultra 12 is the best vitamin B12 you can find out there.
[01:44:52.474 --> 01:44:56.816]  It's uber absorbable and it's 50% off right now at InfoWarsLive.com.
[01:44:58.732 --> 01:45:06.904]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[01:45:08.208 --> 01:45:12.949]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[01:45:12.949 --> 01:45:15.289]  Super Male Vitality!
[01:45:15.289 --> 01:45:24.151]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:35.073]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[01:45:35.313 --> 01:45:35.994]  Yes.
[01:45:35.994 --> 01:45:40.898]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[01:45:40.898 --> 01:45:47.623]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[01:45:47.623 --> 01:45:48.864]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:45:48.864 --> 01:45:50.745]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[01:45:50.745 --> 01:45:53.548]  Never been a better time than right now.
[01:45:53.548 --> 01:45:57.051]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com
[01:45:59.537 --> 01:46:06.641]  Starting about 24 years ago, I began to get calls from major Hollywood directors, producers, actors.
[01:46:06.641 --> 01:46:07.862]  They wanted to meet with me.
[01:46:07.862 --> 01:46:10.263]  And they said, what is your formal education?
[01:46:10.263 --> 01:46:12.404]  And I said, well, really nothing but a few years of college.
[01:46:12.404 --> 01:46:19.028]  They said, well, how are you one of the best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard?
[01:46:19.028 --> 01:46:22.810]  The stuff you come up with is just unbelievable.
[01:46:22.810 --> 01:46:23.830]  We'd like you to be in movies.
[01:46:23.830 --> 01:46:25.071]  We'd like you to write with us.
[01:46:25.071 --> 01:46:26.532]  We'd like you to do voiceovers.
[01:46:27.008 --> 01:46:28.228]  You're just a renaissance man.
[01:46:28.228 --> 01:46:31.829]  Folks know I was in some movies and Harry Shearer makes statements like that and a lot of others.
[01:46:31.829 --> 01:46:33.129]  I'm not bragging.
[01:46:33.129 --> 01:46:34.169]  And I kept explaining to them.
[01:46:34.169 --> 01:46:38.230]  I said, do you understand I didn't come up with any of this?
[01:46:38.230 --> 01:46:43.171]  I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents.
[01:46:43.171 --> 01:46:45.492]  And they would just laugh at me and say, oh, no way.
[01:46:45.492 --> 01:46:47.292]  Then I would give them the documents.
[01:46:47.292 --> 01:46:51.773]  They would get very, very scared the next time I saw them in a few months and say, man, you're right.
[01:46:51.773 --> 01:46:52.953]  This is just topic.
[01:46:52.953 --> 01:46:55.214]  Folks, I didn't make any of this up.
[01:46:55.214 --> 01:46:56.314]  OK, it's real.
[01:46:56.314 --> 01:46:56.734]  It's real.
[01:47:01.327 --> 01:47:03.942]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:26.522 --> 01:47:27.262]  Welcome back!
[01:47:27.262 --> 01:47:32.384]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, Austin.
[01:47:32.384 --> 01:47:36.766]  Here's the Zero Hedge headline, The Exodus Begins!
[01:47:36.766 --> 01:47:38.487]  Well, it actually began a long time ago.
[01:47:38.487 --> 01:47:46.370]  Joe Rogan is leaving LA for Texas, and he's already here, because he wants a little bit more freedom.
[01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:50.651]  He had a New York Times writer on, and they discussed it, then they got into wearing masks.
[01:47:50.651 --> 01:47:52.112]  It all ties together.
[01:47:52.112 --> 01:47:55.013]  I'm gonna get into that right now.
[01:47:55.013 --> 01:47:55.133]  But,
[01:47:56.089 --> 01:48:08.052]  Think about this, in Iran, in Saudi Arabia, in Sudan, in more than 20 countries, women have to fully cover their faces and wear burqas, full beekeeper suits.
[01:48:08.052 --> 01:48:14.394]  In the other countries, they have to partially cover themselves up, because, you know, a woman showing herself as very evil if another man sees it.
[01:48:15.074 --> 01:48:23.236]  Now they have a movement in Iran where women take them off and they get arrested, they even get shot, they even get killed.
[01:48:23.236 --> 01:48:26.636]  But see, that's because a woman's dirty, she's bad, she deserves it, I guess, under Sharia law.
[01:48:26.636 --> 01:48:35.738]  The left thinks that's really fashionable and cool and all these big leftist stores, you know, show hijabs and the burkinis where women cover up their whole bodies to go swimming.
[01:48:35.738 --> 01:48:42.640]  But now, because we're all dirty and can have the evil COVID, we all have to
[01:48:43.973 --> 01:48:49.236]  cover ourselves because Fauci, who's been wrong about everything and totally lied to us, he says so.
[01:48:49.236 --> 01:48:55.258]  And because the head of the UN says it's only getting worse, it's never getting better.
[01:48:55.258 --> 01:48:56.779]  So that's where all this is going.
[01:48:56.779 --> 01:49:06.284]  And police are brutalizing people in New York and places like Miami, Florida, all leftist areas, if they don't wear their new little sign of submission.
[01:49:06.284 --> 01:49:10.125]  Islam means submission.
[01:49:10.125 --> 01:49:12.867]  Well, I'm not submitting to Islam or to the NIH.
[01:49:14.608 --> 01:49:24.114]  Or any of this, but you know the WHO head is a communist islamicist on top of it, and they know this is a sign of total control and slavery, so boy!
[01:49:25.011 --> 01:49:26.852]  Never thought it'd come here.
[01:49:26.852 --> 01:49:28.913]  Now they're saying the masks are basically permanent.
[01:49:28.913 --> 01:49:32.375]  I played that clip in a special Saturday show, but you can pull it up.
[01:49:32.375 --> 01:49:35.577]  WHO head says lockdown will never end.
[01:49:35.577 --> 01:49:38.479]  Trump said Fauci'd have us shut down for years.
[01:49:38.479 --> 01:49:41.961]  He said 2.5 million would be dead.
[01:49:41.961 --> 01:49:42.921]  It's 150,000.
[01:49:42.921 --> 01:49:44.502]  Most of them died of other diseases.
[01:49:44.502 --> 01:49:46.403]  I heard a five-year-old died.
[01:49:46.403 --> 01:49:47.384]  My wife was sitting there.
[01:49:47.384 --> 01:49:48.284]  I said, let me guess.
[01:49:48.284 --> 01:49:49.525]  It says he had underlying conditions.
[01:49:49.525 --> 01:49:49.965]  Yeah.
[01:49:49.965 --> 01:49:51.486]  It says multiple underlying conditions.
[01:49:54.258 --> 01:49:55.979]  Then you test false positive.
[01:49:55.979 --> 01:49:58.080]  Well, stubborn false positive.
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:49:58.720]  It's incredible.
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:49:59.801]  So we have to challenge this.
[01:49:59.801 --> 01:50:01.621]  But here is the mask Nazi.
[01:50:01.621 --> 01:50:02.962]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:50:02.962 --> 01:50:10.466]  Woman, Macy's couple with their children not wearing masks while eating at a park.
[01:50:10.466 --> 01:50:15.908]  I've been in restaurants in Austin now where women come in in hijabs and they're eating spaghetti under it like this.
[01:50:15.908 --> 01:50:16.949]  What a clown show!
[01:50:16.949 --> 01:50:21.591]  But now there's a crazy woman at a park in San Diego, a good liberal, where they submit
[01:50:22.779 --> 01:50:25.084]  This is what she did to the family, daring to go outside.
[01:50:25.084 --> 01:50:25.384]  Here it is.
[01:50:29.810 --> 01:50:34.891]  What are you doing?
[01:50:34.891 --> 01:50:38.172]  You cannot be serious.
[01:50:38.172 --> 01:50:39.352]  You just maced him.
[01:50:39.352 --> 01:50:42.473]  You just maced him.
[01:50:42.473 --> 01:50:44.114]  You just maced him.
[01:50:44.114 --> 01:50:47.295]  You just maced him and their food because you disagreed.
[01:50:47.295 --> 01:50:48.935]  Don't worry, I'm videotaping.
[01:50:48.935 --> 01:50:49.415]  Don't worry.
[01:50:49.415 --> 01:50:50.255]  I'm not going to.
[01:50:50.255 --> 01:50:51.256]  This is not fair.
[01:50:51.256 --> 01:50:51.676]  Not okay.
[01:50:57.057 --> 01:50:58.578]  What's wrong with you, lady?
[01:50:58.578 --> 01:50:59.918]  That is wrong.
[01:50:59.918 --> 01:51:01.319]  You're getting your ass beat.
[01:51:01.319 --> 01:51:02.079]  I don't care who you are.
[01:51:02.079 --> 01:51:04.660]  It's okay, guys.
[01:51:04.660 --> 01:51:05.701]  They want that power.
[01:51:05.701 --> 01:51:08.162]  They want that control.
[01:51:08.162 --> 01:51:08.982]  Don't worry, I got it.
[01:51:08.982 --> 01:51:11.683]  You weren't defending yourself, lady, and I've got this.
[01:51:11.683 --> 01:51:13.464]  Did she hurt her?
[01:51:13.464 --> 01:51:14.285]  I didn't do anything!
[01:51:14.285 --> 01:51:20.727]  But see, they say you're bad, you're all suspect, and so they're gonna come literally spray your food like the Wicked Witch.
[01:51:20.727 --> 01:51:21.728]  She's hiked her leg on you.
[01:51:23.083 --> 01:51:24.063]  Now, let's shift gears.
[01:51:24.063 --> 01:51:31.026]  Joe Rogan had Joe Decina of the New York Times on, and he's talking about, I'm coming to Texas.
[01:51:31.026 --> 01:51:34.667]  I heard Davy Crockett's coming to Texas sometime, too.
[01:51:34.667 --> 01:51:37.068]  I think he already got there, sorry.
[01:51:37.068 --> 01:51:42.850]  And then they get into, oh, Texans are wearing their masks now.
[01:51:42.850 --> 01:51:45.191]  Well, yeah, in Austin, because it's basically LA.
[01:51:47.076 --> 01:51:49.939]  And there's $2,000 fines if a business doesn't have people do it.
[01:51:49.939 --> 01:51:52.181]  500% is totally unconstitutional.
[01:51:52.181 --> 01:51:55.284]  It's got medical waivers in there, but nobody tells you that.
[01:51:55.284 --> 01:51:57.005]  If you say you have anxiety or whatever.
[01:51:57.005 --> 01:51:58.066]  It's totally ineffective.
[01:51:58.066 --> 01:51:59.367]  All the studies show it.
[01:51:59.367 --> 01:52:03.291]  But notice the New York Times guy goes, Oh, Texas got reality.
[01:52:03.291 --> 01:52:04.612]  Texas figured it out.
[01:52:05.598 --> 01:52:08.000]  And they're wearing their masks now because it's so serious.
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.322]  You mean they're doing 100 times the testing?
[01:52:10.322 --> 01:52:11.783]  And the tests are fraudulent on record?
[01:52:11.783 --> 01:52:15.306]  I played a report earlier where the CDC admits it's not COVID.
[01:52:15.306 --> 01:52:18.669]  It's any type of viral or bacterial infection they're now saying picks it up?
[01:52:18.669 --> 01:52:19.970]  The test is a fraud!
[01:52:22.108 --> 01:52:23.769]  But we just barrel forward with it.
[01:52:23.769 --> 01:52:26.351]  They're counting people that died of other things in it.
[01:52:26.351 --> 01:52:28.933]  It's 20-something times less than what they said would die.
[01:52:28.933 --> 01:52:30.714]  But notice, it's never ending, though.
[01:52:30.714 --> 01:52:32.015]  It's not the 15 days.
[01:52:32.015 --> 01:52:33.396]  The hospitals weren't filled.
[01:52:33.396 --> 01:52:34.397]  It's forever.
[01:52:34.397 --> 01:52:37.579]  Because once you let a group take over like this, they never turn loose.
[01:52:37.579 --> 01:52:39.381]  We have a medical global tyranny.
[01:52:39.381 --> 01:52:40.562]  This is the U.N.
[01:52:40.562 --> 01:52:41.702]  running this.
[01:52:41.702 --> 01:52:43.424]  Telling us we must follow what the U.N.
[01:52:43.424 --> 01:52:43.944]  says.
[01:52:43.944 --> 01:52:45.245]  Oh, that's not W.H.O.
[01:52:45.245 --> 01:52:47.747]  approved.
[01:52:47.747 --> 01:52:49.148]  A communist.
[01:52:49.148 --> 01:52:50.249]  The guy that heads up the W.H.O.
[01:52:50.249 --> 01:52:51.710]  is an admitted communist.
[01:52:53.902 --> 01:52:56.904]  Bill Gates is financing it all on record!
[01:52:56.904 --> 01:53:01.826]  I'll show you something after this Joe Rogan clip, but here, let's go ahead and roll the clip with Joe talking about he's coming to Texas.
[01:53:01.826 --> 01:53:02.727]  Here it is.
[01:53:02.727 --> 01:53:03.287]  And what's the story?
[01:53:03.287 --> 01:53:04.348]  You moving?
[01:53:04.348 --> 01:53:05.328]  I'm out of here.
[01:53:05.328 --> 01:53:06.028]  When do you leave?
[01:53:06.028 --> 01:53:07.109]  Soon.
[01:53:07.109 --> 01:53:07.569]  Texas?
[01:53:07.569 --> 01:53:08.710]  Yeah, I'm gonna go to Texas.
[01:53:09.465 --> 01:53:10.526]  I got a farm in Vermont.
[01:53:10.526 --> 01:53:12.127]  It's a little cold.
[01:53:12.127 --> 01:53:14.248]  Vermont's cold.
[01:53:14.248 --> 01:53:21.373]  I just want to go somewhere in the center of the country, somewhere it's easier to travel to both places and somewhere we have a little bit more freedom.
[01:53:21.373 --> 01:53:26.237]  Also, I think that where we live right here in Los Angeles is overcrowded and I think
[01:53:27.017 --> 01:53:28.799]  Most of the time, that's not a problem.
[01:53:28.799 --> 01:53:31.921]  But I think it's exposing the fact that it's a real issue.
[01:53:31.921 --> 01:53:48.094]  When you look at the number of people that are catching COVID because of this overpopulation issue, when you look at the traffic, when you look at the economic despair, when you look at the homelessness problem that's accelerated radically over the last 6, 7, 10 years,
[01:53:50.496 --> 01:53:51.877]  I think there's too many people here.
[01:53:51.877 --> 01:53:53.078]  I think it's not tenable.
[01:53:53.078 --> 01:53:54.419]  I don't think it's manageable.
[01:53:54.419 --> 01:53:59.302]  And I think every mayor does a shit job of doing it because I don't think anybody could do a great job of it.
[01:53:59.302 --> 01:54:05.186]  I think there's like certain things you're gonna have to deal with when you have a population of whatever the fuck LA is.
[01:54:05.186 --> 01:54:07.368]  It's like 20 million plus people.
[01:54:07.368 --> 01:54:07.968]  It's too many people.
[01:54:07.968 --> 01:54:08.889]  It's too many people.
[01:54:08.889 --> 01:54:10.410]  Yeah, that's what I think.
[01:54:10.410 --> 01:54:12.311]  I think where you're living is probably the perfect way to do it.
[01:54:12.311 --> 01:54:12.631]  It's 500 people.
[01:54:13.912 --> 01:54:14.732]  That's nuts.
[01:54:14.732 --> 01:54:17.594]  But then you got those dudes yelling at you, where's the deer?
[01:54:17.594 --> 01:54:19.255]  Do you understand the language?
[01:54:19.255 --> 01:54:19.875]  I could go on.
[01:54:19.875 --> 01:54:24.817]  We could do hours of the negatives of a small town.
[01:54:24.817 --> 01:54:26.098]  Oh yeah, there's negatives.
[01:54:26.098 --> 01:54:27.619]  Everybody knows your business.
[01:54:27.619 --> 01:54:28.339]  Yeah.
[01:54:28.339 --> 01:54:30.920]  Everybody knows what you're doing, where you're going.
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:32.901]  You know, there's pros and cons to everything.
[01:54:32.901 --> 01:54:37.984]  But I think you have a better opportunity at more pros when there's less folks.
[01:54:38.444 --> 01:54:39.484]  I agree.
[01:54:39.484 --> 01:54:41.385]  So small town Texas or?
[01:54:41.385 --> 01:54:42.946]  Let's just leave it at that.
[01:54:42.946 --> 01:54:44.307]  I got ideas.
[01:54:44.307 --> 01:54:46.268]  Jamie's coming.
[01:54:46.268 --> 01:54:47.208]  He's all excited.
[01:54:47.208 --> 01:54:48.529]  It doesn't affect the business?
[01:54:48.529 --> 01:54:50.209]  No, we're just going to do it from there.
[01:54:50.209 --> 01:54:52.110]  That's the other thing is Texas has comedy.
[01:54:52.110 --> 01:54:52.971]  They have stand-up comedy.
[01:54:52.971 --> 01:54:58.153]  I've been doing, I did, well I haven't been doing, but I did one weekend in Texas while all this was going on.
[01:54:58.153 --> 01:55:00.154]  It was the first weekend I was able to do stand-up.
[01:55:01.134 --> 01:55:05.058]  But then my friends were in San Antonio and they got COVID down there.
[01:55:05.058 --> 01:55:09.982]  But those knuckleheads were out there talking to people and shaking hands and taking pictures and stuff.
[01:55:09.982 --> 01:55:14.846]  Texas would be the last stand place to ever wear a mask or not shake a hand.
[01:55:14.846 --> 01:55:16.068]  They wear masks though.
[01:55:16.068 --> 01:55:17.369]  People are wearing masks.
[01:55:17.369 --> 01:55:18.209]  Last time I was there.
[01:55:18.209 --> 01:55:19.931]  I think now they're woken up, right?
[01:55:19.931 --> 01:55:21.913]  Well, this is a weird disease, man.
[01:55:24.238 --> 01:55:29.803]  Alright, and you know, I've talked to Joe about this, and he said, no, you're the first person to tell me it was man-made, so doesn't that make it deadly?
[01:55:29.803 --> 01:55:36.710]  No, it's man-made, so it's a chimera, so it's artificial, so these labs can own it, and control it, and own the testing for it, and it's all fraud.
[01:55:36.710 --> 01:55:37.711]  And we've detailed this.
[01:55:37.711 --> 01:55:39.613]  Here's an example, right here.
[01:55:39.613 --> 01:55:49.021]  Sinclair, bigger than Fox News, thousands of stations across the country, says it will postpone and rework segment featuring conspiracy theory about Fauci with the Eric Bolling Show.
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:52.681]  I personally sent Bowling articles about this in the last few months.
[01:55:52.681 --> 01:55:54.462]  He knew all about it already!
[01:55:54.462 --> 01:55:56.103]  And what did he cover?
[01:55:56.103 --> 01:55:58.504]  NIH.gov!
[01:55:58.504 --> 01:56:02.726]  NIH lifts funding pause on gain-of-function research with coronaviruses.
[01:56:02.726 --> 01:56:05.487]  Dr. Fauci backed controversial Wuhan lab with U.S.
[01:56:05.487 --> 01:56:08.268]  dollars for risky coronavirus research at Wuhan lab.
[01:56:08.268 --> 01:56:09.289]  Newsweek!
[01:56:09.289 --> 01:56:09.889]  Newsweek!
[01:56:09.889 --> 01:56:11.210]  Look right there, that's Newsweek!
[01:56:13.598 --> 01:56:16.099]  This is the reality to Joe's guests at the New York Times.
[01:56:16.099 --> 01:56:18.440]  The cases are skyrocketing, the deaths are going way down.
[01:56:32.176 --> 01:56:43.066]  I predict they'll go spiking again when the numbers come in at the end of the month because July is when the new doctors and nurses come in for their residencies and they call it the July effect.
[01:56:43.066 --> 01:56:47.129]  I get into real statistics, real information, real research.
[01:56:47.129 --> 01:56:52.033]  It was a major scientific scandal that our government said we've got to make it illegal
[01:56:52.694 --> 01:56:56.316]  The scientist told Obama, you can't have these weaponized coronaviruses in our labs.
[01:56:56.316 --> 01:56:58.057]  So he just took it to China.
[01:56:58.057 --> 01:57:00.239]  And Fauci ran it with Bill Gates.
[01:57:00.239 --> 01:57:01.740]  Look up who funded Wuhan.
[01:57:01.740 --> 01:57:04.582]  And now Sinclair is under criticism for this.
[01:57:04.582 --> 01:57:08.904]  And they go, oh, we'll rework it or won't air it.
[01:57:08.904 --> 01:57:12.687]  And I just showed you Newsweek, NIH, New Scientist.
[01:57:12.687 --> 01:57:14.008]  I could show you a hundred more.
[01:57:15.438 --> 01:57:27.207]  Was a major, major controversy, but since when is Oliver Darcy, the guy that brags he helped get me banned off the internet, since when is that rat, that possum, the guy that goes around and decides what can be on air and what can't?
[01:57:27.207 --> 01:57:31.130]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, this full show will be posted, the banned-out video.
[01:57:31.130 --> 01:57:32.891]  Please promote all our local stations.
[01:57:32.891 --> 01:57:40.617]  Thank the local sponsors, become a sponsor, but realize the globalists are fighting to keep us from getting out, but thanks to you, the broadcast is actually exploding!
[01:57:40.617 --> 01:57:41.718]  God bless you all!
[01:57:41.718 --> 01:57:43.619]  Retransmission starts now!
[01:57:43.619 --> 01:57:44.680]  Spread those live links!
[01:57:47.824 --> 01:57:52.988]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at infowarestore.com.
[01:57:52.988 --> 01:57:54.610]  You can wear them out to political events.
[01:57:54.610 --> 01:57:56.171]  You can trigger lib darts.
[01:57:56.171 --> 01:58:03.457]  But one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween.
[01:58:03.457 --> 01:58:09.722]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[01:58:09.722 --> 01:58:15.307]  It's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the forced inoculations and contact tracing of their openly.
[01:58:15.649 --> 01:58:15.989]  I don't know.
[01:58:26.863 --> 01:58:31.265]  It's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing.
[01:58:31.265 --> 01:58:35.066]  And the M95 mask only controls what's coming in, not what's going out.
[01:58:35.066 --> 01:58:37.147]  So they quote, spread COVID-19.
[01:58:37.147 --> 01:58:38.648]  They don't protect from it.
[01:58:38.648 --> 01:58:41.609]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back at these control freak spaces.
[01:58:41.609 --> 01:58:44.250]  You buy one for $9.95, you get four more free.
[01:58:44.250 --> 01:58:45.250]  They're at cost.
[01:58:45.250 --> 01:58:46.651]  Infowarrestore.com.
[01:58:48.191 --> 01:58:52.816]  There are a lot of signs that people are really waking up to the new world order and global government.
[01:58:52.816 --> 01:58:55.939]  But one of the biggest is privacy pouches.
[01:58:55.939 --> 01:58:58.842]  I've been selling these for more than 10 years.
[01:58:58.842 --> 01:59:00.924]  In the old days, they weren't 100% effective.
[01:59:00.924 --> 01:59:01.805]  Now they are.
[01:59:01.805 --> 01:59:04.528]  They're little bitty, lightweight Faraday cages that
[01:59:04.628 --> 01:59:10.051]  Small phones and even large cell phones fit into very, very comfortably and then slip right into your pocket.
[01:59:10.051 --> 01:59:11.912]  And these things work great that way.
[01:59:11.912 --> 01:59:12.593]  You're not tracked.
[01:59:12.593 --> 01:59:17.236]  You're not traced by government, by big corporations, by big tech, by hackers, by criminals.
[01:59:17.236 --> 01:59:18.576]  They're selling your data.
[01:59:18.576 --> 01:59:20.318]  They're using it against you.
[01:59:20.318 --> 01:59:23.579]  AI uses this to be able to predict the future, manipulate markets.
[01:59:23.579 --> 01:59:27.382]  It's critical that everyone stop going around with your cell phones being naked.
[01:59:27.842 --> 01:59:30.404]  Well, I gotta tell you, normally we probably sold a couple hundred a month.
[01:59:30.404 --> 01:59:33.967]  We're selling upwards of a thousand of these a day.
[01:59:33.967 --> 01:59:36.149]  Plus, we have a good unit and it's also a good price.
[01:59:36.149 --> 01:59:37.690]  We have it in four different colors.
[01:59:37.690 --> 01:59:40.852]  It's the Privacy Pockets at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:40.852 --> 01:59:42.153]  People are really waking up.
[01:59:42.153 --> 01:59:46.117]  I'm seeing it all over the news that folks are aware of this and are now using these.
[01:59:46.117 --> 01:59:51.301]  Get yours at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:59:51.301 --> 01:59:53.923]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
