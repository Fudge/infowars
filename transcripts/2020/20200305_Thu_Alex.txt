[00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:11.117]  Big Brother.
[00:00:11.117 --> 00:00:12.918]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:12.918 --> 00:00:14.799]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.500]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.161]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:18.161 --> 00:00:22.865]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:40.346]  And they're taking away fundamental rights.
[00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:53.850]  I want to tell you, Gorsuch, I want to tell you, Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price!
[00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.971]  You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.
[00:00:58.971 --> 00:01:04.173]  I don't care about your weird, very narrow definition of what a baby is and when life occurs.
[00:01:04.173 --> 00:01:04.973]  Weren't you a baby once?
[00:01:05.919 --> 00:01:07.160]  What does that have to do with anything?
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.041]  I don't know.
[00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:09.342]  Are you going to have babies someday?
[00:01:09.342 --> 00:01:10.403]  I'm not going to have children.
[00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:11.624]  I don't want to have children.
[00:01:11.624 --> 00:01:17.269]  I know that's something that very confuses y'all, but there are some people that truly do not decide to have children in this world.
[00:01:17.269 --> 00:01:19.952]  That's why I've had three abortions, because I don't want to have children.
[00:01:19.952 --> 00:01:22.214]  Well, thank you for talking to us.
[00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:26.438]  Yeah, and please, I can't wait to see your heavily edited and bullsh** interview when it's online.
[00:01:27.178 --> 00:01:28.339]  Oh great!
[00:01:28.339 --> 00:01:29.760]  Wonderful!
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.901]  You got all this teal on, lipstick, scarf.
[00:01:31.901 --> 00:01:32.682]  Who are you with?
[00:01:32.682 --> 00:01:33.482]  DC News Foundation.
[00:01:33.482 --> 00:01:37.345]  Can you tell us what you're doing here today?
[00:01:37.345 --> 00:01:38.465]  We're rallying.
[00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:40.447]  For what?
[00:01:40.447 --> 00:01:42.448]  For abortion access.
[00:01:42.448 --> 00:01:45.670]  That's what I thought.
[00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.931]  What are you saying about us?
[00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:47.631]  That's not nice!
[00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:50.173]  She wants to be the new gun girl.
[00:01:50.173 --> 00:01:52.354]  What?
[00:01:52.354 --> 00:01:53.255]  Who's the gun girl?
[00:01:55.663 --> 00:01:56.123]  I don't.
[00:01:56.123 --> 00:01:57.704]  Okay.
[00:01:57.704 --> 00:01:59.004]  Alright, well.
[00:01:59.004 --> 00:02:02.426]  I thought you guys would want to stand up for what you believe in, but nobody's going to talk to us.
[00:02:02.426 --> 00:02:08.148]  Well, it's because you're doing, as I said earlier, you're doing a biased and coercive interview.
[00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:09.748]  You're asking leading questions.
[00:02:09.748 --> 00:02:12.269]  That's not journalism.
[00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.851]  I'm here to defend abortion rights because I've had abortions and abortion is f***ing cool.
[00:02:17.523 --> 00:02:18.484]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:02:18.484 --> 00:02:23.128]  I'm giving you some good stuff for your YouTube channel or whatever the f**k it is.
[00:02:23.128 --> 00:02:24.369]  Yeah.
[00:02:24.369 --> 00:02:28.893]  Because liberation is fantastic and abortion allowed me to be the liberated woman that I am.
[00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:31.282]  Yeah.
[00:02:31.282 --> 00:02:35.445]  Well, you know, and I'm asking you this straight, so you tell me your straight answers.
[00:02:35.445 --> 00:02:37.186]  We're not messing around here.
[00:02:37.186 --> 00:02:39.627]  A lot of people here are saying... No, I don't care what a lot of people are saying.
[00:02:39.627 --> 00:02:39.847]  Okay.
[00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:41.408]  So I won't engage in that conversation.
[00:02:41.408 --> 00:02:41.929]  Okay.
[00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:43.109]  Yeah, that's not what I'm here about.
[00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.250]  I'm not here about what they're saying.
[00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.152]  I'm here about what I'm saying, which is abortion is a human right.
[00:02:47.152 --> 00:02:48.593]  Abortion should remain legal.
[00:02:48.593 --> 00:02:51.855]  Abortion should have extra protections.
[00:02:51.855 --> 00:02:54.416]  Why are you here if you don't care about anything going on here?
[00:02:54.416 --> 00:02:58.219]  Because I'm here to witness what's happening at the Supreme Court and to stand with other supporters.
[00:03:00.666 --> 00:03:02.207]  I do care about what's going on in Louisiana.
[00:03:02.207 --> 00:03:03.728]  See, this is why I didn't want to talk to you.
[00:03:03.728 --> 00:03:09.352]  I'm saying very clear, very succinct things, and you're being, but you're saying, and that's not what I'm saying.
[00:03:09.352 --> 00:03:11.454]  Quit trying, no, no, we're not going to do this.
[00:03:11.454 --> 00:03:12.755]  You're not going to manipulate my words.
[00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:14.576]  I care about what's happening in Louisiana.
[00:03:14.576 --> 00:03:16.537]  I care about what's happening in other states, too.
[00:03:16.537 --> 00:03:17.598]  I'm from North Carolina.
[00:03:17.598 --> 00:03:18.339]  I live in the South.
[00:03:18.339 --> 00:03:20.740]  I know what abortion access is like in the South.
[00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.021]  You want to?
[00:03:22.021 --> 00:03:25.363]  I want to talk about what I want to talk about.
[00:03:25.363 --> 00:03:27.425]  I don't want to talk about what you want to talk about.
[00:03:27.425 --> 00:03:30.027]  Okay, so, do you want to talk about Louisiana?
[00:03:30.527 --> 00:03:31.228]  What do you want to know?
[00:03:31.228 --> 00:03:32.268]  What do you want to talk about?
[00:03:32.268 --> 00:03:36.411]  Do you think that abortion clinics should be held to the same medical standards as hospitals?
[00:03:36.411 --> 00:03:37.272]  They already are.
[00:03:37.272 --> 00:03:38.132]  So yes, absolutely.
[00:03:38.132 --> 00:03:39.093]  Oh, that's incorrect.
[00:03:39.093 --> 00:03:39.433]  They're not.
[00:03:39.433 --> 00:03:42.395]  Well, they're not held to the same standards as hospitals because they're not hospitals.
[00:03:42.395 --> 00:03:48.639]  They are not providing all-inclusive care for a variety of illnesses and diseases, nor are they providing a variety of surgeries.
[00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.863]  They are providing invasive but not dangerous, quick, quality health care.
[00:03:53.863 --> 00:03:55.524]  Abortion procedures are safe.
[00:03:55.524 --> 00:03:59.667]  They are not a surgical procedure in the sense you are being cut open and you need a sterile
[00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:00.247]  I don't
[00:04:19.343 --> 00:04:19.643]  Thank you.
[00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:40.942]  Some reason an ER doctor knows how to treat a healthcare complication with any other routine patient.
[00:04:40.942 --> 00:04:46.484]  By the way, ladies and gentlemen, Chuckie Schumer was at this rally saying we're going to basically attack the Supreme Court.
[00:04:46.484 --> 00:04:48.244]  That shows who these bullies and people are.
[00:04:48.244 --> 00:04:54.426]  And women at the rally had signs of babies being chopped up and alligators eating babies and celebrated the murder of babies.
[00:04:54.426 --> 00:04:59.048]  This is a culture of satanists.
[00:04:59.048 --> 00:04:59.888]  Rich in Alabama.
[00:04:59.888 --> 00:05:00.648]  Rich, thanks for calling.
[00:05:01.852 --> 00:05:02.512]  I appreciate it.
[00:05:02.512 --> 00:05:05.174]  First thing, I love the turbo force.
[00:05:05.174 --> 00:05:08.716]  I drive truck for a living, and it's amazing.
[00:05:08.716 --> 00:05:13.579]  Coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end, but that turbo force is amazing.
[00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:16.160]  How is turbo force different than coffee?
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.821]  I'll tell you what.
[00:05:17.521 --> 00:05:21.065]  Sustainable, anywhere from 18 hours.
[00:05:21.065 --> 00:05:24.609]  I don't feel the jitters like I do drinking coffee.
[00:05:24.609 --> 00:05:28.434]  And it's just, you know, at the end of the day, I don't need anything to go to bed.
[00:05:28.434 --> 00:05:31.797]  I'll, you know, I'll pop a knockout, boom, I'm out cold.
[00:05:32.398 --> 00:05:39.283]  So that's what we went out to a top developer who didn't want his name on it, and I said, what would the ultimate long, say, 10-hour energy be?
[00:05:39.283 --> 00:05:40.224]  Is that possible?
[00:05:40.224 --> 00:05:46.468]  That's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are healthy and natural that are time-released.
[00:05:46.468 --> 00:05:49.790]  And there's more money in it than anybody else puts in their product.
[00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:53.133]  So that's why TurboForce has such a great effect.
[00:05:53.133 --> 00:05:55.795]  And so I really appreciate you, and I'm glad that you like TurboForce.
[00:06:23.328 --> 00:06:34.676]  Live on this March 5th, Thursday broadcast, the year is 2020 with 242 days left until the historic election.
[00:06:34.676 --> 00:06:40.920]  And things are not normal.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:46.844]  Things are not in a state of just regular globalist activity.
[00:06:46.844 --> 00:06:50.166]  The world is at a major crossroads right now.
[00:06:51.474 --> 00:06:54.635]  And things are not the same.
[00:06:54.635 --> 00:06:56.636]  And things are not going to be stable.
[00:06:56.636 --> 00:07:00.417]  They're going to be extremely explosive.
[00:07:00.417 --> 00:07:01.617]  Now, I've been predicting that about 2020.
[00:07:01.617 --> 00:07:20.704]  It wasn't hard to predict, but now it's very, very, very clear that we are going to see turmoil and revolution and economic crises and biological crises and cultural crises and spiritual crises on a level never before seen as we go through
[00:07:23.956 --> 00:07:26.718]  He's trying.
[00:07:26.718 --> 00:07:27.699]  Times.
[00:07:27.699 --> 00:07:31.862]  Well, global tourism has crashed due to coronavirus.
[00:07:31.862 --> 00:07:36.426]  Italy has cancelled sporting events and other nations are following suit.
[00:07:36.426 --> 00:07:39.448]  Over 120 people have died in Italy and that's just what we're learning about now.
[00:07:39.448 --> 00:07:46.994]  There's videos of rooms and hospitals just full of body bags with dead people inside of them.
[00:07:46.994 --> 00:07:48.576]  Something big is going on.
[00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:54.312]  And it's because the virus is killing a lot more people than the flu does.
[00:07:54.312 --> 00:07:56.974]  Maybe one-tenth of 1% with the flu, the CDC estimates.
[00:07:56.974 --> 00:07:58.375]  That's probably an accurate estimate.
[00:07:58.375 --> 00:07:59.876]  And most of those people are run down.
[00:07:59.876 --> 00:08:00.396]  They're old.
[00:08:00.396 --> 00:08:01.857]  They've got pre-existing conditions.
[00:08:01.857 --> 00:08:04.859]  Still, it's serious.
[00:08:04.859 --> 00:08:08.381]  The coronavirus looks like it kills 2% of people.
[00:08:08.381 --> 00:08:12.123]  As if you average Asians and Anglos and everybody else in together.
[00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:25.064]  And so, you're seeing governments use this as a crackdown, and use this as a police state, and obviously, they're hyping up the fear in China and other areas for control.
[00:08:25.064 --> 00:08:41.794]  Trump's tried to tap down the fear, but while quietly blocking airline flights from China three weeks ago, and getting criticized for it, meanwhile, Israel and so many other countries are totally blocking flights, not just out of China, but now out of Europe.
[00:08:41.794 --> 00:08:42.335]  And how long
[00:08:43.353 --> 00:08:44.714]  But they block flights out of the US.
[00:08:44.714 --> 00:08:46.315]  So I'm going to say this again.
[00:08:46.315 --> 00:08:50.158]  Coronavirus is a giant global disaster.
[00:08:50.158 --> 00:08:56.843]  It is a historic event of massive implications and proportions.
[00:08:56.843 --> 00:09:04.689]  On the supply chain destabilization front alone, it's the equivalent of Godzilla destroying Tokyo.
[00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:10.252]  And you've got our own government saying, don't get masks.
[00:09:10.252 --> 00:09:15.436]  You don't need them when you damn well, many of these masks do massively restrict the amount of virus you would get.
[00:09:15.436 --> 00:09:17.098]  They're on 100%.
[00:09:17.098 --> 00:09:21.461]  But 99.9999 is better than nothing.
[00:09:21.461 --> 00:09:22.282]  Like a water filter.
[00:09:22.282 --> 00:09:26.185]  Oh, your water filter only gets out 99.99% of lead and mercury.
[00:09:26.185 --> 00:09:30.488]  Yeah, that's a lot better than all of it going through.
[00:09:30.488 --> 00:09:30.669]  So,
[00:09:32.079 --> 00:09:32.920]  This is a big deal.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:37.062]  Now, Macron is seizing the mask nationwide because obviously the hospitals need them.
[00:09:37.062 --> 00:09:42.445]  And that's why Trump had the CDC come out and say, hey, you don't really need those masks.
[00:09:42.445 --> 00:09:50.970]  Well, that's because they want you grabbing them all so they can have them at the hospitals and the emergency centers getting ready for what's coming.
[00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:56.554]  And China covered up what was happening, but then used it as a power grab once it was apparent that it caused a panic and killed.
[00:09:57.850 --> 00:09:59.151]  It's probably hundreds of thousands.
[00:09:59.151 --> 00:10:04.253]  I mean, the footage out of the cities is just body bags and exhausted doctors and piles of dead people.
[00:10:04.253 --> 00:10:06.694]  And I mean, you said folks dropping dead on the street.
[00:10:06.694 --> 00:10:07.934]  Most of the footage is real.
[00:10:07.934 --> 00:10:12.657]  There's fake footage where folks are just jumping on or two people fall down the street side by side.
[00:10:12.657 --> 00:10:15.418]  Either it's fake or they got sprayed with something else.
[00:10:15.418 --> 00:10:22.341]  And we know the stuff that the government of China has been driving around spraying on everybody is toxic and is killing animals and probably killing people.
[00:10:22.341 --> 00:10:24.822]  So who knows what they're piggybacking on this?
[00:10:26.209 --> 00:10:30.332]  Who knows what the binary weapons are that are being added to this witch's brew?
[00:10:30.332 --> 00:10:32.833]  Dr. Francis Boyle, who's the author of the U.S.
[00:10:32.833 --> 00:10:36.676]  Biological Weapons Treaty that became world law, has been proven absolutely on target.
[00:10:36.676 --> 00:10:38.357]  He's with us for the third hour today.
[00:10:38.357 --> 00:10:46.082]  But I intend to open the phones up in the first two hours here for you to give us your take on the coronavirus.
[00:10:46.082 --> 00:10:52.926]  But even prominent folks that I know, and I'm not going to name names because they're friends of mine, that think the coronavirus was a hoax.
[00:10:52.926 --> 00:10:53.927]  I talked to one of them this morning.
[00:11:01.383 --> 00:11:10.649]  They now believe that people are dying, but that maybe it's being sprayed in the atmosphere, or there's another weapon, and that could be.
[00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:26.300]  But the point is, even the biggest skeptics now are going, okay, I know somebody who'd deathly ill, or I know somebody that died, and they're trying to cover up the deaths, and the government is on record trying to block the kits going out, and Obama put out bad kits, and Obama's the one that transferred it to China five years ago, that's just a fact, that's in science.
[00:11:27.301 --> 00:11:29.302]  The Journal of Science five years ago.
[00:11:29.302 --> 00:11:30.562]  What are you doing transferring this to them?
[00:11:30.562 --> 00:11:32.582]  So you add all this together.
[00:11:32.582 --> 00:11:39.524]  It is a perfect storm of insanity.
[00:11:39.524 --> 00:11:44.526]  So I want to give first-time callers a chance and also first responders a chance.
[00:11:44.526 --> 00:11:51.188]  And people in China or in Italy or in the hardest-hit areas like Hong Kong, we'd like to hear from you front of the lines.
[00:11:51.188 --> 00:11:52.228]  You tell us that you're calling
[00:11:53.223 --> 00:11:55.005]  From an area hard hitter, do you have any intel?
[00:11:55.005 --> 00:11:58.008]  You'll go to the head of the line, just please tell us so we'll know.
[00:11:58.008 --> 00:12:03.934]  To put you to the head of the line, 877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[00:12:03.934 --> 00:12:09.199]  And again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:12:09.199 --> 00:12:13.844]  Very honored to be here with you, but we are not in normal times.
[00:12:13.844 --> 00:12:15.645]  And I just wanted to signify that today.
[00:12:16.775 --> 00:12:21.197]  Any way I can to just visually let folks know that this isn't a drill.
[00:12:21.197 --> 00:12:21.798]  This is 2020.
[00:12:21.798 --> 00:12:33.323]  And if you think the coronavirus is the end of all the craziness, the Islamic invasion launched by Turkey into Europe, the Greeks fighting back and turning back the hordes that the government was trying to back against them.
[00:12:33.323 --> 00:12:36.045]  Just insane stock market gyrations.
[00:12:36.045 --> 00:12:40.887]  The Dow Jones Industrial Average down 700 points.
[00:12:40.887 --> 00:12:42.648]  The left tried to trigger a race war.
[00:12:42.648 --> 00:12:44.309]  The left nominating.
[00:12:44.309 --> 00:12:45.389]  They've basically done it now.
[00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:46.190]  Warren's dropped out.
[00:12:48.427 --> 00:12:52.950]  Joe Biden, who obviously has mid-stage dementia.
[00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:59.294]  This is an incredible time to be alive right now, and nobody is a spectator on planet Earth.
[00:12:59.294 --> 00:13:03.998]  You are in the middle of the fight to determine the rest of human future.
[00:13:03.998 --> 00:13:05.639]  And let me then make two points before we go to break.
[00:13:05.639 --> 00:13:07.960]  Come back with your calls at 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[00:13:22.193 --> 00:13:37.105]  It's more important than ever to be focused on God and focused on your center and not worrying about the establishment and not worrying about what the left does and not worrying about their legal terrorism or just anything they do to attack you and just get right with God.
[00:13:37.105 --> 00:13:37.765]  That's my advice.
[00:13:37.765 --> 00:13:38.306]  That's what I'm doing.
[00:13:39.039 --> 00:13:43.061]  And then separately, when you get right with God, you then focus and you say, I need clean water.
[00:13:43.061 --> 00:13:44.382]  I need plenty of sleep.
[00:13:44.382 --> 00:13:46.583]  I need to spend time praying.
[00:13:46.583 --> 00:13:47.844]  That boosts your immune system on record.
[00:13:47.844 --> 00:13:49.024]  Even if you don't believe in God, it does.
[00:13:49.024 --> 00:13:49.825]  Look at the studies.
[00:13:49.825 --> 00:13:51.325]  Type in prayer, boost immune system.
[00:13:51.325 --> 00:13:52.266]  Those that pray live longer.
[00:13:54.528 --> 00:13:59.433]  And hug your family and just get together and know that it's not the virus that everybody's fearing.
[00:13:59.433 --> 00:14:00.634]  People know there's a big threat.
[00:14:00.634 --> 00:14:03.076]  It's the globalists are going to make a bunch of moves this year.
[00:14:03.076 --> 00:14:04.978]  And everybody's secretly scared.
[00:14:04.978 --> 00:14:10.603]  So they see the virus, which is obviously really serious, but then they go, oh, that's why I'm feeling so much trepidation.
[00:14:10.603 --> 00:14:11.284]  No.
[00:14:11.284 --> 00:14:18.130]  Open world government, Antichrist, Mark of the Beast, anti-family, pedophilia out in the open, Hollywood demons attacking.
[00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:19.532]  It's now all clear.
[00:14:21.169 --> 00:14:26.152]  That the Bible's right, and there is a devil, and there is a God, and we're on this planet being tested.
[00:14:26.152 --> 00:14:28.074]  And so, it's okay you have that fear.
[00:14:28.074 --> 00:14:29.795]  That's your spirit getting concerned.
[00:14:29.795 --> 00:14:31.896]  Run up underneath God's wings.
[00:14:31.896 --> 00:14:32.737]  You won't have fear anymore.
[00:14:32.737 --> 00:14:35.239]  You'll have a spirit of strength, and not of an overcomer.
[00:14:35.239 --> 00:14:38.461]  And then, spread the word about beacons of truth.
[00:14:38.461 --> 00:14:45.006]  Big spotlights in the night that are telling the truth, like Band.Video and Infowars.com, Ford Slash Show, and Summit.News.
[00:14:46.109 --> 00:14:48.013]  Newswars.com and all the other great sites.
[00:14:48.013 --> 00:14:49.576]  National File, not our site.
[00:14:49.576 --> 00:14:50.498]  Great folks.
[00:14:50.498 --> 00:14:51.500]  Summit, not my site.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.001]  Paul's site.
[00:14:52.001 --> 00:14:53.163]  But we promote it.
[00:14:53.163 --> 00:14:54.225]  Great work.
[00:14:54.225 --> 00:14:55.929]  And realize that's a true act of resistance.
[00:14:55.929 --> 00:14:56.710]  And then go further.
[00:14:58.564 --> 00:14:59.945]  Get the products you need.
[00:14:59.945 --> 00:15:03.906]  We have DNA Force Plus back in stock with PQQ and CoQ10.

[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.582]  They just gotta package it.

[00:17:28.389 --> 00:17:32.312]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[00:17:32.312 --> 00:17:33.853]  I sued the IRS and won.
[00:17:33.853 --> 00:17:36.815]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[00:17:36.815 --> 00:17:42.378]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[00:17:42.378 --> 00:17:43.579]  I can help you, too.
[00:17:43.579 --> 00:17:46.521]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[00:17:46.521 --> 00:17:48.743]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[00:17:48.743 --> 00:17:53.186]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[00:17:53.186 --> 00:17:55.527]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.

[00:18:59.204 --> 00:18:59.965]  Real stuff, man.
[00:18:59.965 --> 00:19:01.145]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[00:19:01.145 --> 00:19:06.609]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[00:19:06.609 --> 00:19:09.471]  Everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[00:19:09.471 --> 00:19:11.193]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[00:19:11.193 --> 00:19:14.435]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[00:19:14.975 --> 00:19:18.817]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[00:19:18.817 --> 00:19:20.058]  20 different stickers.
[00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:21.679]  Impeach the Democrats.
[00:19:21.679 --> 00:19:22.760]  Save the Second Amendment.
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:23.840]  Defend the First Amendment.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.181]  Infowars.com.
[00:19:25.181 --> 00:19:27.343]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[00:19:27.343 --> 00:19:32.125]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[00:19:32.125 --> 00:19:33.706]  People say, why are you doing this?
[00:19:33.706 --> 00:19:34.227]  What's happening?
[00:19:34.227 --> 00:19:37.989]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored, and, you know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[00:19:37.989 --> 00:19:41.131]  And Dr. Pucinich, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[00:19:41.391 --> 00:19:42.152]  Brilliant.
[00:19:42.152 --> 00:19:49.258]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made it into a weapon.
[00:19:49.258 --> 00:19:52.201]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[00:19:52.201 --> 00:19:55.023]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[00:19:55.023 --> 00:20:01.389]  Silence.
[00:20:01.389 --> 00:20:04.051]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:09.389 --> 00:20:09.990]  We've got it.
[00:20:09.990 --> 00:20:16.517]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:20:16.517 --> 00:20:20.921]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:20:20.921 --> 00:20:26.567]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:20:45.187 --> 00:20:58.999]  We are back live on this live Thursday March 5th 2020 transmission and we're gonna be going to your phone calls Barbara and Hanneman and many others on the coronavirus.
[00:20:58.999 --> 00:21:01.721]  This morning I got up at about 5 a.m.
[00:21:01.721 --> 00:21:09.168]  read a bunch of news talked to some of my sources in the last few days reflecting on what what their perspective is.
[00:21:10.976 --> 00:21:12.897]  And it just hit me.
[00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:13.498]  It's true.
[00:21:13.498 --> 00:21:16.119]  Coronavirus is absolutely horrible.
[00:21:16.119 --> 00:21:20.762]  And it is killing a lot more people than the flu, statistically, for those that get it.
[00:21:20.762 --> 00:21:23.383]  Not overall, because the flu is already distributed.
[00:21:23.383 --> 00:21:26.345]  And governments have covered it up so far.
[00:21:26.345 --> 00:21:33.849]  But if you watch the government ministers and stuff, even when they don't know they're on camera, refusing to shake each other's hands and things in Europe,
[00:21:35.325 --> 00:21:40.308]  And in China, they are scared of this, because it's killing a lot of people.
[00:21:40.308 --> 00:21:47.932]  And yeah, mainly folks that are older, over 70, people that have diabetes, people that have pre-existing conditions, people that just had surgery.
[00:21:47.932 --> 00:21:50.393]  But it's killing healthy people as well.
[00:21:50.393 --> 00:21:57.057]  Hundreds are now admitted dead in Italy, and you know that number is going to get much higher, and it just showed up there two weeks ago.
[00:22:00.188 --> 00:22:02.370]  It's barely spread any.
[00:22:02.370 --> 00:22:06.913]  It's not hit large populations yet and it's already killing a lot of people.
[00:22:06.913 --> 00:22:10.535]  Now clearly governments are using it to crack down on populations.
[00:22:10.535 --> 00:22:20.783]  But the attack on the infrastructure and the attack on the just-on-time delivery systems is going and
[00:22:21.581 --> 00:22:22.361]  Well, it's not going to.
[00:22:22.361 --> 00:22:26.484]  It already has really hurt the economy and the stock market's down 700 points today.
[00:22:26.484 --> 00:22:43.534]  Trump is propping it up, which is fine with me because it's all fiat to begin with, but as the numbers grow and as more people get sick and as more die, you already have the precedent set of the panic we saw in China, boarding up people's houses, welding them shut like it's a horror movie and there's zombies.
[00:22:45.373 --> 00:22:49.218]  When things happen like that, humans are mammals.
[00:22:49.218 --> 00:22:53.484]  And we see what other humans do, and we behave the same way at a very deep level.
[00:22:53.484 --> 00:22:54.906]  We believe in the knowledge of the crowd.
[00:22:55.794 --> 00:22:57.255]  I'll have to use this analogy a hundred times.
[00:22:57.255 --> 00:22:58.355]  I'll do it again.
[00:22:58.355 --> 00:23:00.236]  You don't know where you are in some small town.
[00:23:00.236 --> 00:23:04.078]  Back before Google was ubiquitous with reviews, which you can now believe.
[00:23:04.078 --> 00:23:06.059]  At first they were good, because Google let you actually vote.
[00:23:06.059 --> 00:23:07.359]  Now it's all scam in most cases.
[00:23:07.359 --> 00:23:14.563]  But before that, you pulled into a small town in Colorado or Michigan or New York, and you see the restaurant with lines out the door.
[00:23:14.563 --> 00:23:16.404]  That's got the good food.
[00:23:16.404 --> 00:23:20.366]  Restaurant with four or five cars, you're going to get food poisoning there.
[00:23:20.366 --> 00:23:20.886]  Just the way it is.
[00:23:22.022 --> 00:23:28.263]  You don't need to go into that restaurant that has four cars in it to find out there's a meth head running it and they're dealing drugs out of the back.
[00:23:28.263 --> 00:23:34.224]  You just know that's a creepy looking place.
[00:23:34.224 --> 00:23:35.165]  Well, it's the same thing.
[00:23:35.165 --> 00:23:47.647]  You watch the Chinese shooting people at checkpoints and people collapsing on the street and wailing and screaming and body bags piled up and you know something big hit China.
[00:23:50.515 --> 00:23:54.616]  And so even the people that I know, who are friends of mine, that thought it was all BS.
[00:23:54.616 --> 00:23:56.796]  I talked to one of them this morning and another one last night.
[00:23:56.796 --> 00:23:59.477]  They're like, actually, I think they're spraying something in the air.
[00:23:59.477 --> 00:24:00.857]  I think it's what the Chinese released.
[00:24:00.857 --> 00:24:04.758]  And I think there's a cover for something else, but something big's going on.
[00:24:04.758 --> 00:24:06.098]  Yeah, that's totally legitimate.
[00:24:06.098 --> 00:24:08.398]  A lot of times they'll say it's one thing, it's another.
[00:24:08.398 --> 00:24:11.599]  All I know is it's admitted that virus is man-made.
[00:24:11.599 --> 00:24:13.019]  And it's now spreading really fast.
[00:24:13.019 --> 00:24:15.140]  It's super communicable.
[00:24:15.140 --> 00:24:17.080]  And it is a Frankenstein creation.
[00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:24.594]  Complete with the microscopic cuts on it, where they sandwich it together like a pie.
[00:24:24.594 --> 00:24:31.518]  And... The question is, how bad is it gonna get?
[00:24:31.518 --> 00:24:32.759]  How big is it?
[00:24:32.759 --> 00:24:34.100]  Who's really behind it?
[00:24:34.100 --> 00:24:35.180]  And what's the endgame?
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:44.066]  Because if it's man-made, and it popped up right on time, and they're trying to blame... And they're trying to blame Trump for it, as we predicted,
[00:24:45.390 --> 00:25:01.399]  It's really crazy how InfoWars Wargaming, our audience, our guests, because your wargaming has been as good as mine or anybody's callers, that's why I love taking your calls, that our information has absolutely been spot on.
[00:25:01.399 --> 00:25:08.924]  With the Peace Shuttle gene and the protein points where it was injected in the HIV delivery system.
[00:25:08.924 --> 00:25:11.265]  But just don't believe Alex Jones.
[00:25:11.265 --> 00:25:14.367]  Believe the epidemiologist and the virologist and
[00:25:16.104 --> 00:25:23.388]  Dr. Francis Boyle joining us in the third hour, who is the leading legal expert on this, and talking to the top medical experts on it.
[00:25:23.388 --> 00:25:29.971]  And he said, a month ago here, he said, this is really bad, it's man-made, and has a high kill rate, probably 2%.
[00:25:29.971 --> 00:25:33.513]  And now that's exactly the latest numbers, and we hope it's way lower than that.
[00:25:34.193 --> 00:25:38.235]  You know, Lancet had a limited thing five weeks ago of just 47 deaths.
[00:25:38.235 --> 00:25:41.596]  They needed at least 65 to get a decent reading.
[00:25:41.596 --> 00:25:45.057]  But with the ones they had, it was a 15% death rate or so.
[00:25:45.057 --> 00:25:47.878]  But obviously, those people are already super sick, and so it's not a good focus group.
[00:25:47.878 --> 00:25:48.779]  It's not a good test group.
[00:25:48.779 --> 00:25:50.819]  It's a proper term.
[00:25:50.819 --> 00:25:52.280]  So, phew!
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.801]  Because, I mean, if it was 15%, I would be in a bunker somewhere.
[00:25:55.801 --> 00:25:57.502]  I mean, I don't want to lose any of my kids, man.
[00:25:57.502 --> 00:26:01.223]  I tell you, you talk about Russian roulette, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:26:01.223 --> 00:26:02.644]  15% is basically Russian roulette.
[00:26:07.054 --> 00:26:09.136]  Six cylinders, eight cylinders in the revolver.
[00:26:09.136 --> 00:26:19.023]  You know, you spin it and hope you don't, hope you don't pull the wrong, hope you don't pull the wrong cylinder.
[00:26:19.023 --> 00:26:27.429]  So we're going to take your phone calls on this when we come back with Melinda and Dennis and Patrick and Hanneman and many, many others.
[00:26:27.429 --> 00:26:27.589]  877-789-2539.
[00:26:27.589 --> 00:26:30.451]  We can get into the economy.
[00:26:30.451 --> 00:26:32.392]  We can get into the democratic field.
[00:26:32.392 --> 00:26:33.033]  We can get into
[00:26:34.341 --> 00:26:42.123]  A man that cannot string one coherent sentence together is who is going to be the nominee.
[00:26:42.123 --> 00:26:46.304]  I mean, call him the nominee for a week, but he won Super Tuesday.
[00:26:46.304 --> 00:26:48.645]  They obviously cheated, just like last time with Hillary.
[00:26:48.645 --> 00:26:51.726]  The Democrats control the delegates, the superdelegates.
[00:26:51.726 --> 00:26:53.846]  And that's it.
[00:26:53.846 --> 00:26:56.167]  It's his turn.
[00:26:56.167 --> 00:27:00.128]  The aging Skeksy to take a turn at being Emperor of the Dark Crystal.
[00:27:03.171 --> 00:27:04.712]  What are they planning behind that?
[00:27:04.712 --> 00:27:07.154]  You don't know.
[00:27:07.154 --> 00:27:12.478]  She admits that they're trying to sell Hillary to flutter in as the VP and then he has a stroke.
[00:27:15.188 --> 00:27:28.875]  Other presidents have had Woodrow Wilson, who brought us the New World Order first, and then in there's Hillary, because there's a cult of Hillary in the bureaucracy and a messianic vision that she's supposed to, you know, take over and rule everyone.
[00:27:28.875 --> 00:27:37.180]  These leftists still believe in the cult of Hillary, so we'll discuss all of that as well today.
[00:27:39.158 --> 00:27:43.242]  The global terrorism is something we have to look at as well.
[00:27:43.242 --> 00:27:51.130]  The terrorism of masses of people with using children as human seals pouring across the border en masse.
[00:27:52.754 --> 00:28:07.988]  And making us then pay for them and then setting up shop on average 80 plus percent military age men, criminal enterprises of drug dealing and prostitution and rigging the welfare system, a cancer to bring down Europe and the United States.
[00:28:07.988 --> 00:28:10.110]  This is a directed system.
[00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:14.173]  You add to that the global tourism is crashing due to coronavirus.
[00:28:14.173 --> 00:28:16.215]  That story up on Infowars.com.
[00:28:16.215 --> 00:28:19.018]  Global spread of new virus brings more travel woes, bans.
[00:28:22.793 --> 00:28:26.618]  So there's just some of what we're going to be laying out today.
[00:28:26.618 --> 00:28:28.821]  I want to be totally clear.
[00:28:28.821 --> 00:28:30.203]  How deadly the virus is, we're not sure.
[00:28:30.203 --> 00:28:31.204]  We know it spreads easily.
[00:28:31.204 --> 00:28:34.649]  We know it's man-made, but we know the response is tanking.
[00:28:36.618 --> 00:28:52.413]  The supply chain, and travel, and tourism, and it's going to be massive because as the numbers of death increase, even if it's a very low number, the way things have been pre-positioned, it's going to create a loss of confidence, which the Democrats and globalists called for to hurt Trump, Balasaro, and other nationalists.
[00:28:52.413 --> 00:28:54.194]  This is the empire striking back.
[00:28:54.194 --> 00:28:54.575]  Stay with us.
[00:28:57.330 --> 00:29:01.873]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[00:29:01.873 --> 00:29:03.974]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[00:29:03.974 --> 00:29:05.695]  I had a problem like you once.
[00:29:05.695 --> 00:29:12.258]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[00:29:12.258 --> 00:29:17.341]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[00:29:17.341 --> 00:29:22.044]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[00:29:22.484 --> 00:29:25.585]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[00:29:25.585 --> 00:29:32.588]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[00:29:32.588 --> 00:29:37.771]  And if you have PPO private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[00:29:37.771 --> 00:29:41.072]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[00:29:41.072 --> 00:29:42.032]  Get clean.
[00:29:42.032 --> 00:29:43.853]  Call now and learn more.
[00:29:43.853 --> 00:29:43.893]  800-506-6740.
[00:29:47.875 --> 00:29:48.135]  800-506-6740.
[00:29:48.135 --> 00:29:48.355]  That's 800-506-6740.
[00:29:59.321 --> 00:30:01.763]  We know that the globalists are in trouble.
[00:30:01.763 --> 00:30:08.768]  Humanity's waking up to their tyranny, how they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes, how they're building a post-human world.
[00:30:08.768 --> 00:30:10.649]  But we know they're going to strike back.
[00:30:10.649 --> 00:30:25.801]  And the UN has said that they're going to absolutely implode third-world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the West and collapse our social services in a giant Cloward and Piven program.
[00:30:26.281 --> 00:30:34.130]  The UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government in a coronavirus.
[00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:41.098]  This is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading the word because people
[00:30:41.118 --> 00:30:51.430]  People are waking up like never before, but this fight against tyranny is neck and neck, so spread the word about Band.Video and Infowars.com forward slash show.
[00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:53.452]  That is so important.
[00:30:53.452 --> 00:30:55.955]  You are at the center of the resistance.
[00:30:55.955 --> 00:30:57.357]  You are our only hope.
[00:30:59.384 --> 00:31:04.587]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[00:31:04.587 --> 00:31:08.889]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[00:31:08.889 --> 00:31:13.332]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[00:31:13.332 --> 00:31:21.737]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breathe air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[00:31:21.737 --> 00:31:28.961]  Powerful, quiet, and effective, the Breathe uses a four-step purification process to help you breathe easier and cleaner.
[00:31:29.381 --> 00:31:32.984]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars.
[00:31:32.984 --> 00:31:38.287]  But the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.
[00:31:38.287 --> 00:31:46.373]  The breeze and the ion cluster patented technology used in the system eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.
[00:31:46.373 --> 00:31:51.756]  Get the Alexa Pure Breeze today and save big on a world-class air filtration system for your home.
[00:31:51.756 --> 00:31:54.018]  Don't keep breathing toxic or dangerous air.

[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:06.365]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness, and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[00:32:06.365 --> 00:32:06.945]  That's good.
[00:32:06.945 --> 00:32:09.327]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[00:32:09.327 --> 00:32:16.311]  The average person is living hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck, and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[00:32:16.311 --> 00:32:19.993]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared.
[00:32:19.993 --> 00:32:26.958]  And that means, even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply that you know is always there, that you only go to in emergencies.
[00:32:27.578 --> 00:32:32.762]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical, or even more so.
[00:32:32.762 --> 00:32:41.048]  And things like DNA Force Plus, that's now back in stock, is so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.

[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:56.520]  A total 360 win.
[00:33:01.475 --> 00:33:04.071]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:20.535 --> 00:33:37.907]  Recently, conservative impersonator Sebastian Gorka applauded the removal of some of President Donald Trump's biggest supporters at CPAC, the annual political conference attended by conservative activists from across the United States and beyond.
[00:33:38.467 --> 00:33:50.780]  Gorka was ridiculed after calling for the removal of popular CPAC personalities that he doesn't like, including people he says should have never been let in to begin with.
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:57.787]  And that means independent and conservative voices outside the establishment conservative mainstream.
[00:33:57.787 --> 00:34:01.051]  It's a big club, as George Carlin would say, and we ain't in it.
[00:34:01.351 --> 00:34:05.795]  Look, Seb Gorka doesn't stand for free speech.
[00:34:05.795 --> 00:34:08.177]  And neither does CPAC, for that matter.
[00:34:08.177 --> 00:34:13.682]  Because when it comes down to it, they're no different from the gatekeepers on the radical left.
[00:34:13.682 --> 00:34:19.007]  Both actively working to de-platform and censor their competition.
[00:34:19.007 --> 00:34:24.092]  And this year, for example, the CPAC blacklist has extended all the way out to
[00:34:24.212 --> 00:34:30.034]  Conservative icons like Michelle Malkin and Ann Coulter, who were not invited.
[00:34:30.034 --> 00:34:43.058]  And although Alex Jones and InfoWars did receive invitations, it wasn't long before the entitled gatekeepers on the radical right did everything in their power to remove the outsiders.
[00:34:43.058 --> 00:34:50.780]  Like InfoWars reporter Owen Schroyer and censored TV's Gavin McGinnis, who were promptly kicked out of CPAC.
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.301]  But hey, at least they went out with style.
[00:34:53.701 --> 00:34:57.227]  We've now been kicked out of CPAC.
[00:34:57.227 --> 00:34:59.391]  We're now being kicked out of reality.
[00:34:59.391 --> 00:35:00.212]  Should we continue this?
[00:35:00.212 --> 00:35:02.617]  I didn't want to come to CPAC anyway.
[00:35:02.617 --> 00:35:03.718]  I'm having my own pack.
[00:35:05.055 --> 00:35:06.316]  With blackjack and hookers.
[00:35:06.316 --> 00:35:08.338]  Tell CPAC that we're having a bigger party.
[00:35:08.338 --> 00:35:10.700]  It's going to be more fun and there's going to be naked ladies.
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:14.523]  I just want everyone to know that CPAC is now kicking InfoWars out.
[00:35:14.523 --> 00:35:17.986]  I just want everyone to know CPAC is now kicking InfoWars out.
[00:35:17.986 --> 00:35:19.247]  God bless you guys.
[00:35:19.247 --> 00:35:20.308]  We love CPAC.
[00:35:20.308 --> 00:35:21.749]  God bless America.
[00:35:21.749 --> 00:35:23.291]  God bless Donald Trump.
[00:35:23.291 --> 00:35:27.454]  This is Harrison Smith going to a much cooler CPAC somewhere else with Gavin McGinnis.
[00:35:27.454 --> 00:35:29.156]  Our CPAC is COOLPAC.
[00:35:29.156 --> 00:35:30.617]  That's what the acronym stands for.
[00:35:30.757 --> 00:35:31.358]  That's right.
[00:35:31.358 --> 00:35:36.882]  So a conservative political action committee is censoring itself in the age of censorship.
[00:35:36.882 --> 00:35:41.326]  They have panels discussing free speech as they censor themselves.
[00:35:41.326 --> 00:35:42.728]  And look at the media coverage here.
[00:35:42.728 --> 00:35:45.210]  InfoWars is the most popular group here.
[00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:53.597]  Meanwhile, Sebastian Gorka continues to publicly claim that he is a supporter of the First Amendment and free speech.
[00:35:53.597 --> 00:35:56.660]  I am for free speech.
[00:35:56.980 --> 00:36:01.542]  But just like the radical left, his actions speak louder than words.
[00:36:01.542 --> 00:36:03.682]  Go away, alright?
[00:36:03.682 --> 00:36:05.083]  You guys are kooks.
[00:36:05.083 --> 00:36:10.125]  And once he figures out he can't win an argument, he wants you silent!
[00:36:10.125 --> 00:36:12.325]  So we shouldn't be allowed to be here?
[00:36:12.325 --> 00:36:19.328]  People, this is for real conservatives, not people who are snake oil merchants and conspiracy theorists like you.
[00:36:19.608 --> 00:36:22.069]  Sebastian Gorka here for Relief Factor.
[00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:26.411]  And first of all, let me say that I have never before endorsed a pain reliever.
[00:36:26.411 --> 00:36:35.015]  But when Pete and Seth Talbot, the father and son owners of Relief Factor, asked me to endorse their 100% drug-free product, I absolutely couldn't say no.
[00:36:35.015 --> 00:36:44.300]  And ironically, the people he is trying to keep quiet are the very same voices who are widely credited for helping Donald Trump get elected to begin with.
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:48.362]  Infowars is the most popular group in the Trump movement, and they're kicking Infowars out.
[00:36:48.462 --> 00:36:50.663]  Trump didn't divide American society.
[00:36:50.663 --> 00:36:56.084]  Alex Jones didn't cause our widespread and, by the way, justified distrusting institutions.
[00:36:56.084 --> 00:36:59.305]  The elites did that with their spectacular failures.
[00:36:59.305 --> 00:37:04.267]  It is Gorka that doesn't fit the description as a true conservative.
[00:37:04.267 --> 00:37:10.469]  He has now taken the role as an establishment insider and entitled gatekeeper.
[00:37:10.469 --> 00:37:13.750]  He is the enemy inside of the gates.
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:36.282]  Agent Gorka.
[00:37:36.282 --> 00:37:37.543]  Conservative inks.
[00:37:37.543 --> 00:37:39.744]  Enemy inside the gates.
[00:37:39.744 --> 00:37:43.727]  That important report is powerful and it needs legs.
[00:37:43.727 --> 00:37:52.413]  Only you can provide that by sharing the link from BAN.VIDEO in the Darren McBrain section or on the front page of InfoWars.com.
[00:37:52.413 --> 00:37:53.974]  I suggest you share BAN.VIDEO.
[00:37:53.974 --> 00:37:55.795]  It's not as censored or restricted.
[00:37:57.287 --> 00:38:01.189]  There it is, right on the front page of Bandot Video, Conservative Inc., Agent Gorka.
[00:38:01.189 --> 00:38:04.251]  In fact, let's make that the top featured video.
[00:38:04.251 --> 00:38:17.118]  Now, I'm going to go to your phone calls, but this is such a heavy subject, the coronavirus, and the fact that it is super bad, and is spreading fast, and is man-made, and is devastating the economy, and is a globalist weapon, is now overwhelmingly factual.
[00:38:18.228 --> 00:38:23.670]  I've talked to a lot of prominent people off air that I don't want to get in fights with, and I called up and said, you really don't think it's deadly?
[00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:24.391]  You think it's a hoax?
[00:38:24.391 --> 00:38:26.992]  They're like, well, no, actually, I think it's, they're spraying something.
[00:38:26.992 --> 00:38:29.513]  Yeah, probably, who knows?
[00:38:29.513 --> 00:38:33.215]  But almost no one thinks it's a hoax anymore, okay?
[00:38:33.215 --> 00:38:39.938]  My gut tells me, I mean, I told my personal assistant,
[00:38:40.891 --> 00:38:42.572]  Three months ago I said the time has come.
[00:38:42.572 --> 00:38:56.322]  Before this I said I just have a feeling that things are dangerous for the economy and even if Trump wins I guess I gotta get a farmhouse a hundred miles middle of nowhere around no towns in the crappiest brush area where no one even knows where I'm at.
[00:38:56.322 --> 00:39:01.125]  I need to just load it with storable food and an underground safe with guns in it just to have that
[00:39:04.795 --> 00:39:06.837]  That box check, because I don't have that.
[00:39:06.837 --> 00:39:10.379]  We've got family property in East Texas, but that's three hours away.
[00:39:10.379 --> 00:39:15.883]  The maps show that if there's a big breakdown of society, Houston's just going to flood up, Dallas is going to flood down.
[00:39:15.883 --> 00:39:20.386]  There's a hurricane in Houston, and it looks like a war zone in East Texas where my family's from.
[00:39:20.386 --> 00:39:26.390]  Robberies in cars, carjackings, people running through your property in the middle of nowhere, people robbing your farmhouse.
[00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:27.471]  I mean, it's just bad.
[00:39:27.471 --> 00:39:28.972]  This country is a time bomb.
[00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:33.231]  Maybe it's a big war that's about to start.
[00:39:33.231 --> 00:39:40.077]  The Islamists have launched big invasions now in phase two into Europe, with Erdogan right behind it.
[00:39:40.077 --> 00:39:41.979]  I know I get calls every time it's Erdogan.
[00:39:41.979 --> 00:39:42.399]  Whatever.
[00:39:42.399 --> 00:39:44.280]  Some say Erdogan, others say Erdogan.
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:45.461]  I'll get a linguist to tell me.
[00:39:45.461 --> 00:39:46.302]  We got a linguist in there.
[00:39:46.302 --> 00:39:51.126]  Daria, is it Erdogan or Erdogan?
[00:39:51.126 --> 00:39:52.107]  Erdogan is correct.
[00:39:52.107 --> 00:39:53.148]  Okay.
[00:39:53.148 --> 00:39:55.950]  There you go.
[00:39:55.950 --> 00:39:57.871]  I'm not very good at pronouncing some things sometimes.
[00:39:57.871 --> 00:39:58.672]  At least I got that right.
[00:40:00.188 --> 00:40:07.691]  Erdogan's gamble backfires as EU gives iron-willed Greeks $780 million to secure their border.
[00:40:07.691 --> 00:40:16.835]  Sometime today, after I take a bunch of calls, but let's just say, bottom of the next hour, I'm going to play a bunch of clips that I was watching this morning and today.
[00:40:16.835 --> 00:40:17.575]  They're unbelievable.
[00:40:19.264 --> 00:40:30.969]  of what the Islamists are doing, the crimes they're committing, not just torturing their children to then blame the police caught doing it and mainstream media now caught staging photo ops with them.
[00:40:30.969 --> 00:40:38.012]  It's just all confirmed and then just raping and murdering and burning things and then the Greeks valiantly fighting back.
[00:40:38.012 --> 00:40:42.114]  So the local leftist government sent a ship full of riot police of leftist
[00:40:43.308 --> 00:40:58.132]  To attack Lesbos, and so Lesbos over a day period ran over 500 armed troops, who were local leftist police, into the ocean, like 300, and then the Greek military swooped in and sealed the border and sealed Lesbos.
[00:40:58.132 --> 00:41:04.153]  So the central government's doing its job, but they have leftist cities helping aid the overrun.
[00:41:04.153 --> 00:41:06.874]  Oh, where have I heard of that before?
[00:41:06.874 --> 00:41:07.734]  Sanctuary cities.
[00:41:08.971 --> 00:41:15.460]  And I'm not liking poor folks that come here from Latin America wanting a better life to the Islamic invaders.
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:17.924]  Most people coming here from Latin America want a better job, want a better life.
[00:41:17.924 --> 00:41:21.950]  They're being exploited, they're being used to drive down wages, they're being used to become leftist political voters.
[00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:23.793]  That's why it's out of control, gotta be controlled.
[00:41:23.793 --> 00:41:25.014]  And there's some crime coming across too.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:31.722]  With the Islamic invasion, it's... I keep saying 80% military-age men, and I looked it up.
[00:41:31.722 --> 00:41:34.483]  It's almost 90% military-age men.
[00:41:34.483 --> 00:41:38.005]  In the last invasion, 2015, 16, 17, it never stopped.
[00:41:38.005 --> 00:41:41.026]  And now it's probably over 90% military-age men.
[00:41:41.026 --> 00:41:47.049]  There's articles on Infowars.com, the one we just showed on Newswars.com.
[00:41:47.049 --> 00:41:47.469]  There it is.
[00:41:47.469 --> 00:41:49.109]  You guys did it before I even said it.
[00:41:49.109 --> 00:41:50.690]  It's almost all men.
[00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:53.531]  Video after video after video.
[00:41:53.531 --> 00:41:55.272]  This is an invasion.
[00:41:57.984 --> 00:42:05.195]  And they're blocking roads, and grabbing families out of their cars, and raping and killing people, and folks are getting pissed, man!
[00:42:05.195 --> 00:42:11.885]  If I was there, and I was Greek, and somebody raped my wife, listen, you know what I'm gonna do to at least 10 of those invaders.
[00:42:14.639 --> 00:42:18.362]  By the way, Poland and places don't have one terror attack or anything.
[00:42:18.362 --> 00:42:22.845]  You're an Islamic military man, you get there illegally, you're never found again.
[00:42:22.845 --> 00:42:26.047]  And that's how Poland survived a thousand years of invasion.
[00:42:26.047 --> 00:42:29.329]  You either start protecting yourself or you die.
[00:42:29.329 --> 00:42:30.971]  You either fight or die!
[00:42:30.971 --> 00:42:36.975]  And that's why, folks, there's a lot of changes around here because I'm in war mode.
[00:42:38.015 --> 00:42:44.139]  And nobody in a fight is gonna grab me like a woman by the hair and slam my head in the ground like I'm a bitch.
[00:42:44.139 --> 00:42:46.240]  They're gonna get nothing but pure war.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:49.663]  Because the season of war is now upon us!
[00:42:49.663 --> 00:42:50.603]  Information war!
[00:42:50.603 --> 00:42:52.664]  Culture war!
[00:42:52.664 --> 00:42:53.765]  Spiritual war!
[00:42:53.765 --> 00:42:54.706]  Economic war!
[00:42:54.706 --> 00:42:56.127]  It is here, so prepare!
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:09.308]  Across the Western world, from high school to college sports, to even the Olympics, men, biological men, are winning almost all of the sporting events.
[00:43:09.308 --> 00:43:17.994]  This is men invading women's spaces and bullying them and taking their rights away, all in the name of liberalism and openness.
[00:43:18.314 --> 00:43:28.880]  And then every day I have stacks of news articles just like today, UK teen fined under house arrest for asking trans police officers gender and it hurt their feelings.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:40.106]  UK mother spared jail for misgendering trans woman ordered to pay thousand pound fine because it could have caused anxiety in the new royalty.
[00:43:40.706 --> 00:43:42.408]  That's the thought police.
[00:43:42.408 --> 00:43:47.553]  If a leftist has their feelings hurt for any reason, you get fined and you go to jail.
[00:43:47.553 --> 00:43:48.855]  This is tyranny.
[00:43:48.855 --> 00:43:55.121]  These people are bullies, and it's sick, and it's evil, and it's part of a scientific anti-human takeover.
[00:43:55.121 --> 00:43:55.742]  Resist it.
[00:43:55.742 --> 00:43:56.543]  Speak out against it.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:00.181]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[00:44:00.181 --> 00:44:07.163]  Ultra 12 and Vitamin Mineral Fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[00:44:07.163 --> 00:44:17.607]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other key cofactors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[00:44:18.047 --> 00:44:24.331]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken sublingually under the tongue.
[00:44:24.331 --> 00:44:25.292]  It is back in stock.
[00:44:25.292 --> 00:44:34.518]  You can get them both individually for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[00:44:34.518 --> 00:44:41.962]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[00:44:41.962 --> 00:44:42.443]  And of course,
[00:44:43.283 --> 00:44:50.007]  Vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[00:44:50.007 --> 00:44:51.248]  And they're both back in stock.
[00:44:51.248 --> 00:44:55.911]  40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:44:58.228 --> 00:45:06.555]  I also want to say that I'm happy to be helping out with an enterprise that is supported by all the work to help people be prepared.
[00:45:06.555 --> 00:45:13.500]  And instead of just giving into sickness care, take care of their health, take care of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality.
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.622]  And I say that from personal experience.
[00:45:15.742 --> 00:45:30.589]  Because I know that the products that are being offered here, I've tried them and I use them every day, and that power pack that they have, the AM-PM power pack, well I wouldn't be so energetic this morning, except that I have been on a regular customer in that regard.
[00:45:31.209 --> 00:45:50.440]  Let me start out by saying that, because I think it's important to remember that beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think about these great events in the world, one of the priorities has to be to take care of yourself, remembering that our lives are a gift from God that He intends us to use for good purpose.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:50.860]  I think?
[00:46:13.353 --> 00:46:14.054]  We're good to go.
[00:46:34.093 --> 00:46:37.914]  Okay, at InfoWarsTore.com, you go right in the queue, first come, first served.
[00:46:37.914 --> 00:46:41.815]  But the fact that the orders are so ultra-massive, it's dizzying.
[00:46:41.815 --> 00:46:43.236]  I mean, this is just insane.
[00:46:43.236 --> 00:46:50.498]  We're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe, and then, if it continues like this, we're looking at having to suspend food sales.
[00:46:50.498 --> 00:46:54.199]  But everybody gets their order in, we'll get your food, but that's how big this is.
[00:46:54.199 --> 00:46:57.980]  So what you're getting is 100% the straight deal of what's going on, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:47:01.357 --> 00:47:11.444]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:11.444 --> 00:47:27.416]  Are you in the mirror today?
[00:47:35.844 --> 00:47:47.151]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are broadcasting worldwide on this transmission brought to you by Beluga Whales.
[00:47:47.151 --> 00:47:52.815]  I woke up this morning and I said, I kind of look like a cute little beluga.
[00:47:52.815 --> 00:47:54.976]  You couldn't be mean to a cute little beluga, could you?
[00:47:56.246 --> 00:48:05.781]  Now things are so serious I got up this morning and I said what can I do to note to everybody that we're in a very serious time now that we're already making jokes.
[00:48:07.421 --> 00:48:08.782]  And well, that's what we've done here on air.
[00:48:08.782 --> 00:48:14.846]  If you're a radio listener, you might want to go to npolwars.com forward slash show or newswars.com forward slash show and check it out and share that link.
[00:48:14.846 --> 00:48:19.850]  A little something different here on the set of the radio slash TV transmission today, but I'm going to leave it at that.
[00:48:19.850 --> 00:48:23.252]  I told the crew not to really make a note of it, but they had their beluga joke ready.
[00:48:23.252 --> 00:48:25.213]  So I let them go with it.
[00:48:25.213 --> 00:48:27.435]  I must look like a beluga because I already thought of myself.
[00:48:27.435 --> 00:48:29.316]  They already spontaneously had a beluga ready.
[00:48:29.316 --> 00:48:31.978]  So that's my new spirit animal is a beluga.
[00:48:31.978 --> 00:48:33.699]  Well, there's a nice little creatures.
[00:48:33.699 --> 00:48:34.660]  Okay, let's get serious.
[00:48:35.967 --> 00:48:38.490]  With something that segues from humor to seriousness.
[00:48:38.490 --> 00:48:45.737]  Here's that video of the now defeated master of the universe, the technocrat in chief, who was going to tell us how to live our lives.
[00:48:45.737 --> 00:48:51.183]  He said, I'm going to go across the country to tell you how to live your life and quote, how to behave.
[00:48:51.183 --> 00:48:53.965]  I can make Americans behave.
[00:48:53.965 --> 00:48:56.388]  He wasn't joking, but he's totally disconnected from reality.
[00:48:56.388 --> 00:48:57.629]  He shakes dogs' faces.
[00:48:58.939 --> 00:49:03.101]  He goes to like a buffet and sticks his fingers in and then eats it and licks them and sticks them back in.
[00:49:03.101 --> 00:49:07.142]  So you talk about who to restrain, who to quarantine, who to lock up during the coronavirus.
[00:49:07.142 --> 00:49:09.323]  Well, I give you patient zero.
[00:49:09.323 --> 00:49:10.583]  That's right.
[00:49:10.583 --> 00:49:23.108]  The now defeated, not successful like Trump, but the failure Mike Bloomberg.
[00:49:23.108 --> 00:49:23.668]  Listen to that.
[00:49:27.555 --> 00:49:32.278]  In front of news cameras, sticking his finger in plates, in the serving dishes.
[00:49:32.278 --> 00:49:33.738]  Disturbing.
[00:49:33.738 --> 00:49:42.923]  And then rubbing.
[00:49:42.923 --> 00:49:46.325]  You know, have you ever been like an apple tree?
[00:49:46.325 --> 00:49:47.506]  Certain types of caterpillars.
[00:49:47.506 --> 00:49:51.528]  That boy is a P.I.G.
[00:49:51.528 --> 00:49:52.489]  pig.
[00:49:52.489 --> 00:49:54.129]  Mini Mike!
[00:49:54.129 --> 00:49:55.610]  Now Mike didn't do too well.
[00:49:55.610 --> 00:49:56.411]  He went way down.
[00:49:57.284 --> 00:50:17.939]  If it's a real still early fall day, and you're in an apple orchard, at least the one I was in when I was a little kid, and there's all these big caterpillars eating leaves that time of year, and if you sit back, you hear all the quack, quack, quack, because there's so many of them, and they're crunching, and you hear the crunch, crunch of the caterpillars, and that's what a very hungry caterpillar indeed
[00:50:19.588 --> 00:50:23.190]  Who did not turn into a beautiful butterfly and become the president.
[00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:24.391]  No, he did not.
[00:50:24.391 --> 00:50:32.216]  He slinked back off to his stolen, rigged stock market scam and his anti-gun operations trying to buy off all local governments.
[00:50:32.216 --> 00:50:34.398]  Okay, I'm going to stop.
[00:50:34.398 --> 00:50:36.639]  And now I'm going to start taking your calls right through the next hour.
[00:50:36.639 --> 00:50:38.200]  We've got a lot of news to cover.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.002]  Dr. Francis Boyle is joining us.
[00:50:41.002 --> 00:50:42.383]  But you know what's going on right now.
[00:50:42.383 --> 00:50:48.948]  The coronavirus news is so intense, so horrible, so scary for me that I'm eating around the edges of it like a
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:53.082]  Not so hungry, Caterpillar, and not getting into it.
[00:50:53.082 --> 00:50:55.723]  But it's killing a lot of people around the world.
[00:50:55.723 --> 00:50:56.783]  It's very communicable.
[00:50:56.783 --> 00:50:57.624]  It's man-made.
[00:50:57.624 --> 00:50:58.785]  I want to know your take on it.
[00:50:58.785 --> 00:50:59.785]  Do you disagree?
[00:50:59.785 --> 00:51:00.345]  Do you agree?
[00:51:00.345 --> 00:51:01.246]  Where do you think it's going?
[00:51:01.246 --> 00:51:02.867]  How bad do you think it's going to get?
[00:51:02.867 --> 00:51:05.808]  And then we have another footage we're going to get to next hour.
[00:51:05.808 --> 00:51:09.870]  It's up on InfoWars.com of a truck driver showing one of the big seaports of the U.S.
[00:51:09.870 --> 00:51:11.371]  just empty of containers.
[00:51:11.371 --> 00:51:12.251]  You never see that.
[00:51:12.251 --> 00:51:14.813]  And of course, we know China's basically shipping almost nothing now.
[00:51:15.745 --> 00:51:21.709]  But it's the visual of that that's extremely powerful, so that's coming up as well next hour.
[00:51:21.709 --> 00:51:25.232]  Okay, without further ado, let's go to Phil in Virginia.
[00:51:25.232 --> 00:51:26.973]  He's a Navy vet on the coronavirus.
[00:51:26.973 --> 00:51:29.074]  Thanks for calling and holding.
[00:51:29.074 --> 00:51:29.675]  Hey, Alex.
[00:51:29.675 --> 00:51:29.955]  Really?
[00:51:29.955 --> 00:51:31.276]  I gotta follow Bloomberg?
[00:51:31.276 --> 00:51:33.257]  I gotta be better than that, right?
[00:51:33.257 --> 00:51:33.698]  Yes, sir.
[00:51:33.698 --> 00:51:35.759]  Well, that's not too hard, is it?
[00:51:35.759 --> 00:51:36.399]  Right on.
[00:51:36.399 --> 00:51:39.862]  Jokes aside, I'm actually nervous to air what
[00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:43.113]  What I think about the coronavirus, even on this show.
[00:51:43.113 --> 00:51:44.114]  So that should tell you something.
[00:51:44.114 --> 00:51:46.137]  Well, lay it on me, brother, because I feel something big.
[00:51:46.137 --> 00:51:47.178]  Yes, sir.
[00:51:47.178 --> 00:51:48.179]  Yes, sir.
[00:51:48.179 --> 00:51:52.844]  So they keep saying that we shouldn't worry about it if we're young and healthy.
[00:51:52.844 --> 00:51:56.569]  It's only old people and compromised people that should worry, right?
[00:51:58.098 --> 00:52:01.859]  What is our largest unfunded liability in this country?
[00:52:01.859 --> 00:52:04.140]  We're 23 trillion dollars in debt.
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:06.901]  And all I hear on the mainstream media... It's people over 70.
[00:52:06.901 --> 00:52:10.062]  And hell, Bill Gates says get rid of the old people.
[00:52:10.062 --> 00:52:12.823]  The liberals said the case for killing Granny.
[00:52:12.823 --> 00:52:19.285]  So, yesterday on Fox News, they had a doctor on that said, hey, I expect to get this and you should too.
[00:52:19.285 --> 00:52:21.766]  But unless you're old, don't worry about it.
[00:52:21.766 --> 00:52:25.147]  So, what would happen if, you know, we know that the
[00:52:26.039 --> 00:52:33.686]  Biggest transfer of wealth in the country is going to occur as the older generation passes, the baby boomer generation passes.
[00:52:33.686 --> 00:52:37.389]  What if the government was able to receive some of that money, i.e.
[00:52:37.389 --> 00:52:40.132]  have a huge crisis with this coronavirus thing?
[00:52:41.916 --> 00:52:49.540]  Sir, I totally agree with you that it's at least a beta test for that because China already had a one-child policy and killed almost 400 million girls.
[00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:52.142]  So don't think that governments don't think like this.
[00:52:52.142 --> 00:52:55.823]  Bill Gates has said this at TED Talks and at other events.
[00:52:55.823 --> 00:52:56.984]  We could play the clips.
[00:52:56.984 --> 00:52:58.045]  So they're saying it.
[00:52:58.045 --> 00:52:59.505]  You better damn well believe.
[00:52:59.505 --> 00:53:04.908]  Oh, and who is involved cooking up a vaccine for it and who owns the Chimera virus?
[00:53:04.908 --> 00:53:06.649]  Oh, a subgroup Bill Gates funds.
[00:53:06.649 --> 00:53:08.090]  Wow, you just can't make that up.
[00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:18.492]  So I haven't heard anyone say that yet, and just to come out of my mouth, it's so disturbing having, you know, parents that are... No, we're going to post this as a video report, a band-aid video.
[00:53:18.492 --> 00:53:28.115]  The headline is, is Corona an age-specific bioweapon to kill the elderly before they get Social Security?
[00:53:28.115 --> 00:53:33.377]  Is coronavirus an age-specific weapon targeting the elderly?
[00:53:35.104 --> 00:53:39.747]  I think that's a very reasonable statement, because it's man-made.
[00:53:39.747 --> 00:53:41.709]  Thank you, sir.
[00:53:41.709 --> 00:53:47.392]  Yeah, if you go to somebody's house, because the neighbor says they haven't come out in a few days, and they're beat to death with a hammer.
[00:53:47.392 --> 00:53:48.453]  And there's a bloody hammer there.
[00:53:48.453 --> 00:53:50.074]  You know it's a murder.
[00:53:50.074 --> 00:53:53.256]  You're like, well, there's a homicide, somebody beat this person to death.
[00:53:53.256 --> 00:53:56.558]  Well, it's a man-made virus!
[00:53:56.558 --> 00:53:59.260]  And it mainly targets old people, so that's a simple investigation.
[00:53:59.260 --> 00:54:01.321]  And we're not saying that's the case.
[00:54:01.321 --> 00:54:03.963]  That it's targeting them on purpose, but that's what it does.
[00:54:05.154 --> 00:54:11.658]  Next on Pawn Stars, we've got Chumlee coming up today.
[00:54:11.658 --> 00:54:13.360]  You gotta sit and know what I'm talking about.
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:14.520]  All right, let's take another one.
[00:54:14.520 --> 00:54:15.861]  Patrick in Washington, you're on the air.
[00:54:15.861 --> 00:54:19.384]  Thanks for holding.
[00:54:19.384 --> 00:54:20.184]  Alex.
[00:54:20.184 --> 00:54:21.465]  Yes, sir.
[00:54:21.465 --> 00:54:25.768]  Yes, thank you for your service, sir, to our country and to the rest of the free world.
[00:54:25.768 --> 00:54:27.289]  Well, thank you, brother.
[00:54:27.289 --> 00:54:30.871]  Hey, I'm right here in Everett, Washington.
[00:54:30.871 --> 00:54:34.874]  I'm a former Marine and I'm, you know, I'm dialed in like you are.
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:40.803]  I want to let you know that the shelves have been really clearing out.
[00:54:40.803 --> 00:54:45.426]  Costco and all the places where you can buy the dry bulk foods, they're empty.
[00:54:45.426 --> 00:54:53.310]  People don't seem to be in too much of a panic, but there are people dialed in that have cleaned the shelves off.
[00:54:53.310 --> 00:55:04.817]  As far as my personal experience with this thing, I've got a coworker who is friends with the woman who managed the healthcare facility in Kirkland, Washington, where we had our first death.
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.121]  And they sent her home.
[00:55:07.121 --> 00:55:08.281]  She's sick.
[00:55:08.281 --> 00:55:09.321]  They haven't tested her.
[00:55:09.321 --> 00:55:10.922]  They refused to test her.
[00:55:10.922 --> 00:55:12.142]  She's at home sick.
[00:55:12.142 --> 00:55:17.064]  Whether she has the virus or not, we don't know, but we can pretty much assume she does.
[00:55:17.064 --> 00:55:21.006]  Also, Jackson High School had a student come down with the virus.
[00:55:21.006 --> 00:55:23.026]  He was sent home for a week.
[00:55:23.026 --> 00:55:30.449]  He felt a little better, came back to school, spent half a day in the school, and then went back home feeling ill.
[00:55:30.449 --> 00:55:31.570]  Well, that's the thing about HIV.
[00:55:33.143 --> 00:55:35.364]  Is that it comes back over and over again.
[00:55:35.364 --> 00:55:38.804]  This has an HIV delivery system, but that wouldn't be enough.
[00:55:38.804 --> 00:55:44.666]  It's then got a whole bunch of different viruses together that do different things and attack different parts.
[00:55:44.666 --> 00:55:49.207]  So yeah, it's a nightmare virus because it hits you and hits you and hits you.
[00:55:49.207 --> 00:55:50.668]  But no one wants to discuss that.
[00:55:50.668 --> 00:55:52.928]  No one's supposed to talk about that.
[00:55:52.928 --> 00:55:54.549]  And that's why I am so pissed.
[00:55:54.549 --> 00:56:00.010]  And let me tell you, it's not a threatening thing to say, but any of my family dies from this.
[00:56:02.807 --> 00:56:04.849]  Well, you just fill in the blank.
[00:56:04.849 --> 00:56:08.992]  It's time to start holding certain people responsible for this type of crap.
[00:56:08.992 --> 00:56:14.116]  And Obama shipped that garbage in 2015.
[00:56:14.116 --> 00:56:16.358]  In fact, bring me my coronavirus file, please.
[00:56:16.358 --> 00:56:17.619]  All three of them, please.
[00:56:17.619 --> 00:56:19.080]  Pull up the Journal of Science.
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:22.002]  I mean, there was a big stir when he did that.
[00:56:22.002 --> 00:56:24.064]  And so, again, I'm not even trying to blame Obama.
[00:56:24.064 --> 00:56:30.669]  I'm saying that obviously this is man-made and something big's about to happen, Patrick.
[00:56:30.669 --> 00:56:31.970]  Tell us something already big is happening.
[00:56:33.277 --> 00:56:39.478]  And that's what I try to remind people because there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of denial up here in Washington State in this left side.
[00:56:39.478 --> 00:56:45.259]  And, you know, people just want to deny things and continue that normalcy bias, right?
[00:56:45.259 --> 00:56:48.880]  That the Jews got on the trains willingly.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:49.660]  Same sort of thing.
[00:56:49.660 --> 00:56:50.980]  They want to keep going with their lives.
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:55.461]  And I understand that, but they got to realize it's a man-made virus.
[00:56:55.461 --> 00:56:57.001]  It's genetically engineered.
[00:56:57.001 --> 00:57:01.022]  They patched in that HIV so it shuts down your immune system's alarm response.
[00:57:02.935 --> 00:57:05.437]  You know, it's much more effective than a natural virus.
[00:57:05.437 --> 00:57:05.978]  Absolutely.
[00:57:05.978 --> 00:57:06.858]  Patrick, God bless you.
[00:57:06.858 --> 00:57:07.319]  Great points.
[00:57:07.319 --> 00:57:07.979]  We're going to go to break.
[00:57:07.979 --> 00:57:09.841]  Come back, go right back to your calls with amazing points.

[00:57:37.841 --> 00:57:39.541]  We have it in supply.
[00:57:39.541 --> 00:57:41.042]  Nobody else does.
[00:57:41.042 --> 00:57:43.483]  It just takes us six to eight weeks to ship it to you because we've got to package it.
[00:57:47.310 --> 00:57:48.351]  Everybody's calling me.
[00:57:48.351 --> 00:57:55.676]  I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really deadly?
[00:57:55.676 --> 00:57:57.117]  How bad is it really?
[00:57:57.117 --> 00:57:59.819]  So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high quality, storable foods.
[00:57:59.819 --> 00:58:02.781]  We have the only company, the biggest in the nation that actually still has food.
[00:58:02.781 --> 00:58:05.503]  It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got to package it.
[00:58:05.503 --> 00:58:06.123]  They got the food.
[00:58:06.123 --> 00:58:08.845]  But I want to encourage listeners to do the most important.

[01:00:05.623 --> 01:00:13.410]  Here are the headlines as they come in.
[01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:14.931]  This is on Infowars.com.
[01:00:14.931 --> 01:00:18.073]  Iran closing schools and universities due to coronavirus outbreak.
[01:00:19.025 --> 01:00:23.987]  They closed all the schools in Italy yesterday and have now banned all sporting events that people can attend.
[01:00:23.987 --> 01:00:25.847]  They're still having sporting events.
[01:00:25.847 --> 01:00:28.688]  Global tourism crashes due to coronavirus.
[01:00:28.688 --> 01:00:33.310]  So the response and the hysteria is seismic and has the stock market downhill.
[01:00:33.310 --> 01:00:34.711]  An hour ago it was 700 points.
[01:00:34.711 --> 01:00:37.291]  What is the Dow Jones Industrial right now?
[01:00:37.291 --> 01:00:38.212]  We'll find out.
[01:00:39.052 --> 01:00:46.177]  Let's go ahead and go to Hanneman, if I'm pronouncing that right, from Oregon, right there in the epicenter of the U.S.
[01:00:46.177 --> 01:00:47.258]  outbreak.
[01:00:47.258 --> 01:00:48.399]  What do you think's really going on?
[01:00:48.399 --> 01:00:50.020]  And thanks for calling.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:51.240]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:52.701]  I've been listening to you since about 2015.
[01:00:52.701 --> 01:00:57.785]  Can I talk about something that happened with me on your products?
[01:00:57.785 --> 01:00:58.165]  Sure, brother.
[01:00:58.165 --> 01:00:59.886]  We're not censoring your... I mean, we're not screening you.
[01:00:59.886 --> 01:01:01.207]  As long as you're calling about the topic.
[01:01:01.207 --> 01:01:02.208]  Go ahead.
[01:01:02.208 --> 01:01:02.688]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:02.688 --> 01:01:04.990]  So, I've been... I got about...
[01:01:06.034 --> 01:01:10.218]  11 of your products in front of me and bodies silver bullets.
[01:01:10.218 --> 01:01:19.925]  I got some of the Super Bowl blue silver before it was sold out and Michael ZX DNA Force X2 Z shield super female vitality.
[01:01:19.925 --> 01:01:27.692]  My wife takes selenium chill force toothpaste was using the super blue and then got the super silver, which is even just even greater.
[01:01:28.846 --> 01:01:39.971]  But I had surgery last fall and had a shoulder replacement, and about two weeks after the surgery, I developed this respiratory issue in my bronchiole.
[01:01:39.971 --> 01:01:41.212]  And nothing was happening.
[01:01:41.212 --> 01:01:43.193]  The doctors weren't able to help me with anything.
[01:01:43.193 --> 01:01:44.173]  It just went on and on.
[01:01:44.173 --> 01:01:47.175]  I couldn't talk without coughing and coughing and coughing.
[01:01:47.175 --> 01:01:50.236]  And I thought, well, maybe this is a fungal thing.
[01:01:50.236 --> 01:01:56.899]  And so I started taking the Micro ZX last week.
[01:01:56.899 --> 01:01:57.520]  I started taking it.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:01.202]  Was on it for, oh, four or five days.
[01:02:01.202 --> 01:02:03.863]  And then I had the DNA force.
[01:02:03.863 --> 01:02:10.408]  I had it and I stopped taking it for some reason after the surgery because I thought, well, maybe I'm having some reaction to that.
[01:02:10.408 --> 01:02:14.570]  But I started taking the DNA force four days ago again.
[01:02:14.570 --> 01:02:22.796]  And just two days ago, I had just a terrible coughing fit, just cough and cough and cough and coughing stuff up.
[01:02:22.796 --> 01:02:25.037]  And then my lungs have been better.
[01:02:25.037 --> 01:02:25.918]  I'm breathing better.
[01:02:26.972 --> 01:02:42.796]  And not having the tension that was in my breathing, and I just attribute it to the micro-ZX and the DNA force, thinking that it was... Well, sir, listen, we have callers calling and they go, you know, I've been listening for years and love your info, but I thought you were just teasing, this is good stuff.
[01:02:42.796 --> 01:02:50.378]  DNA force has proven PQQ and CoQ10, and then other factors that Dr. Griggs came up with, that turbocharge those dosages to get them into the cells.
[01:02:50.378 --> 01:02:52.899]  They literally regrow mitochondria.
[01:02:53.783 --> 01:02:56.945]  Okay, and that's the engines of the cell, the mitochondrial DNA.
[01:02:56.945 --> 01:03:02.509]  So, yeah, my finger got chopped off like 18 years ago, and it was numb for six, seven years.
[01:03:02.509 --> 01:03:07.193]  When I finally got on DNA Force, the feeling came back in about six months.
[01:03:07.193 --> 01:03:10.876]  The danger is, a lot of people have had nerve damage, it was so painful.
[01:03:11.576 --> 01:03:13.437]  That they put up with it, it goes away.
[01:03:13.437 --> 01:03:17.878]  You can take DNA force and the nerves start growing back and the old pain comes back.
[01:03:17.878 --> 01:03:20.899]  So let's not just tell people it's a panacea.
[01:03:20.899 --> 01:03:24.941]  Sometimes old pain comes back because it's regrowing nerves all over the body.
[01:03:24.941 --> 01:03:29.062]  And then usually it gets better after a while, but people call me and go, yeah, you're right, man.
[01:03:29.062 --> 01:03:31.583]  My leg was broken or I had an Achilles tear and kind of ignored it.
[01:03:31.583 --> 01:03:34.364]  And, you know, I got on this and the pain came back.
[01:03:34.364 --> 01:03:37.045]  But now, you know, now, now overall, I have more use of my Achilles.
[01:03:37.045 --> 01:03:38.086]  And I'm talking about myself as well.
[01:03:39.386 --> 01:03:40.447]  Achilles is blown 90%.
[01:03:40.447 --> 01:03:42.068]  People can't believe I walk around on it.
[01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:43.690]  But absolutely, sir.
[01:03:43.690 --> 01:03:45.011]  That's what we're talking about.
[01:03:45.011 --> 01:03:47.673]  What's your view on coronavirus on the West Coast?
[01:03:47.673 --> 01:03:58.002]  Well, you know, I was in Costco a couple weeks ago and I had the show going on across my speakerphone while I was going through Costco.
[01:03:58.002 --> 01:04:02.485]  And I came across this lady and she said, well, who are you listening to?
[01:04:02.485 --> 01:04:04.287]  I said, that's Alex Jones.
[01:04:04.287 --> 01:04:05.608]  She said, I thought he was off the air.
[01:04:07.031 --> 01:04:09.815]  And so I went ahead and educated her and told her where to go.
[01:04:24.739 --> 01:04:32.721]  I run into people at the grocery store, at the mall, at church, at the doctor, on the hike and bike trail, and they go, oh Alex, I used to love you.
[01:04:32.721 --> 01:04:33.841]  I wish you were still on air.
[01:04:33.841 --> 01:04:34.841]  Are you ever going to go back on air?
[01:04:34.841 --> 01:04:38.862]  And I'm like, we're on hundreds of radio stations, over 100 TV stations and cable stations.
[01:04:38.862 --> 01:04:40.922]  We have our own streams at InfoWars.com and Band.TV.
[01:04:40.922 --> 01:04:42.303]  And they go, really?
[01:04:42.303 --> 01:04:43.963]  They said you were off the air.
[01:04:43.963 --> 01:04:47.584]  Because they took the deplatforming as off the air.
[01:04:47.584 --> 01:04:51.585]  Because everybody always thinks of things like talk show hosts, like Matt Lauer gets taken off, he's off.
[01:04:51.585 --> 01:04:53.045]  No, we have our own platform.
[01:04:53.445 --> 01:04:54.385]  Info Wars!
[01:04:54.385 --> 01:04:55.225]  Info Wars!
[01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:56.646]  Info Wars!
[01:04:56.646 --> 01:05:05.367]  I always promote DNA Force Plus with PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans out the cells and empowers the telomeres and the mitochondria.
[01:05:05.367 --> 01:05:11.089]  It's the most powerful formula out there sold over the counter that is known to energize the body.
[01:05:11.089 --> 01:05:14.669]  I'm not going to jack up prices during crisis, but I am going to end up running out.

[01:06:38.186 --> 01:06:40.727]  Because the fight is now.
[01:06:40.727 --> 01:06:46.790]  And only God can sustain us in the victory against Satan and the A.I.
[01:06:46.790 --> 01:06:49.032]  Machine war that's coming.
[01:06:49.032 --> 01:06:51.073]  But in the end, we're gonna win.
[01:06:51.073 --> 01:06:54.915]  And then, the next level of the transformation will be upon us.
[01:06:56.095 --> 01:06:58.698]  We belong to the stars and God.
[01:06:58.698 --> 01:07:03.142]  And that's from whence we came, and that is to where we'll go.
[01:07:03.142 --> 01:07:05.124]  Ashes to ashes.
[01:07:05.124 --> 01:07:07.246]  Star to star.
[01:07:07.246 --> 01:07:11.229]  The universe opens before us.
[01:07:11.229 --> 01:07:13.351]  Look at this headline on InfoWars.com.
[01:07:13.351 --> 01:07:16.434]  Very important Astute Report.
[01:07:16.434 --> 01:07:17.055]  Says it all.
[01:07:19.093 --> 01:07:29.799]  Coronavirus emerges amid hype of anti-globalist revolution and rebellion against globalist tyranny.
[01:07:29.799 --> 01:07:31.900]  From All Thinker News, the great Daniel Taylor.
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:33.661]  We should get him on.
[01:07:33.661 --> 01:07:34.442]  Mankind Now.
[01:07:35.689 --> 01:07:38.070]  Never-before-seen fight for survival.
[01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:43.773]  The globalists are giving us a little taste of what they'll do to make us submit to their control grid.
[01:07:43.773 --> 01:07:49.497]  Just as I exposed in the first six minutes of Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:07:49.497 --> 01:07:53.039]  How they will use bio-weapons and the fear of bio-weapons for total control.
[01:07:53.039 --> 01:07:59.222]  That's how China will try to stop an uprising, which was happening not just in Hong Kong, but inside China.
[01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:02.521]  They released a bio of it.
[01:08:02.521 --> 01:08:05.143]  Has a low kill rate, but still, you get killed by it.
[01:08:05.143 --> 01:08:10.047]  It's like, one man's recession is a depression.
[01:08:10.047 --> 01:08:13.009]  If you're out of work, going bankrupt, about to be homeless, you're in a depression.
[01:08:13.009 --> 01:08:15.170]  Your neighbor, well, that's a recession.
[01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:21.595]  Well, if you're the 2%, it looks like that's what they're saying now, this kills.
[01:08:21.595 --> 01:08:29.140]  Walk out of the door every day, and you're on your block, let's say there's 100 people live on your block, and you come back every day and two people aren't there, that's a big deal.
[01:08:30.902 --> 01:08:33.888]  That's what the Pentagon has been told they believe is going on.
[01:08:33.888 --> 01:08:42.126]  Now, the military people I've talked to, they know just because it comes from on high doesn't mean it's accurate, but that's what they're being told to prepare for, and that's pretty big news, isn't it?
[01:08:44.793 --> 01:08:46.074]  And that's the numbers you see, too.
[01:08:46.074 --> 01:08:47.014]  That's the best numbers.
[01:08:47.014 --> 01:08:51.796]  I mean, what I got from the Pentagon is what we already know, just that's what they're saying.
[01:08:51.796 --> 01:08:59.140]  And they believe three plus million dead Americans the next six months is going to absolutely create a crisis that's even bigger than we currently see.
[01:08:59.140 --> 01:09:05.002]  This is all about suspending the election and then trying to say Trump is illegitimate.
[01:09:05.002 --> 01:09:08.464]  And having government not committing, you can smell it from a mile away.
[01:09:08.464 --> 01:09:08.864]  This is it.
[01:09:14.622 --> 01:09:22.164]  Hanuman from Oregon called in, he hit the brake, he was telling a story that I want him to repeat from the beginning because he got cut off.
[01:09:22.164 --> 01:09:25.625]  Because this is what happens to me every day, everywhere I go.
[01:09:25.625 --> 01:09:27.526]  And again, it's perception.
[01:09:27.526 --> 01:09:29.766]  You know media lies about a lot of things.
[01:09:29.766 --> 01:09:33.007]  They lie about Trump, or they lie about abortion, or they lie about guns.
[01:09:33.007 --> 01:09:40.790]  But when you hear them say, a plane crash and this happened here, or this happened there, you think, well that means they can't lie about something that big.
[01:09:40.790 --> 01:09:41.870]  Oh yeah, they do that too.
[01:09:43.558 --> 01:09:50.260]  There's a lot of examples, not just Jesse Smollett, but ABC saying Trump allowed Turkey to blow up a whole city and it was really a machine gun shootout event.
[01:09:50.260 --> 01:09:56.602]  They blew the video up to make it look like, again, a giant dinosaur was attacking a city or something.
[01:09:56.602 --> 01:10:01.364]  Complete with mushroom clouds, they said, were 5,000 feet tall that were 10 feet tall.
[01:10:01.364 --> 01:10:02.965]  Look at that, army men on the table fighting.
[01:10:02.965 --> 01:10:03.985]  I told you they were real.
[01:10:03.985 --> 01:10:09.687]  That's the culture of disdain and arrogance for these people.
[01:10:09.687 --> 01:10:10.067]  And so,
[01:10:12.585 --> 01:10:21.373]  When you pull back from this and you see the public, yeah, they get they're being lied to, but they don't get how it's now at another level.
[01:10:21.373 --> 01:10:33.263]  So people walk up to me everywhere and they say, Alex, I wish you were still on air because they would watch me on YouTube or they would watch me on Twitter or they would watch me or they would pick up the feeds of our podcast, all of that.
[01:10:33.263 --> 01:10:34.664]  Our podcast is still there, still free.
[01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:38.171]  InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[01:10:38.171 --> 01:10:39.232]  You can watch the feeds.
[01:10:39.232 --> 01:10:43.354]  But for them to hear I was the platform, to hear I was off air, they always saw...
[01:10:44.491 --> 01:10:48.173]  A Chris Matthews, or a Matt Lauer, or whoever, or a Bill O'Reilly.
[01:10:48.173 --> 01:10:48.994]  Well, they're off the air!
[01:10:48.994 --> 01:10:50.394]  Well, you think, well, they're off the air.
[01:10:50.394 --> 01:10:55.957]  Because there isn't really anybody that has their own radio, TV, satellites, and affiliates that they do.
[01:10:55.957 --> 01:10:57.938]  It's only two or three other networks.
[01:10:57.938 --> 01:10:59.279]  And that's all establishment.
[01:10:59.279 --> 01:11:04.742]  And they all try to line up, like Gorka and others do, to be with the New World Order, so they don't get taken off air.
[01:11:04.742 --> 01:11:07.664]  They all subserviate themselves.
[01:11:07.664 --> 01:11:08.804]  They all bootlick.
[01:11:08.804 --> 01:11:10.886]  They have a better word for it called butlick.
[01:11:10.886 --> 01:11:12.607]  But, sorry, family show.
[01:11:13.595 --> 01:11:18.789]  Let's just say their noses are not covered in chocolate.
[01:11:18.789 --> 01:11:21.035]  And so that's the world these people live in.
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:23.961]  But the general public doesn't know.
[01:11:23.961 --> 01:11:27.322]  So if you tell them, hey, you heard that show that's the most hated, most attacked everywhere?
[01:11:27.322 --> 01:11:29.022]  You know it's still on the air.
[01:11:29.022 --> 01:11:32.063]  That is the power of person-to-person.
[01:11:32.063 --> 01:11:33.984]  It isn't coronavirus, but it's knowledge.
[01:11:33.984 --> 01:11:40.185]  Like a fire being lit in the minds of men, as Thomas Jefferson said, we need to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere.
[01:11:40.185 --> 01:11:43.967]  So start your story over again, please, sir, from Oregon.
[01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:44.587]  And you men, go ahead.
[01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:48.556]  I, so yes, I was in Costco a couple weeks ago.
[01:11:48.556 --> 01:11:49.236]  I was getting ready.
[01:11:49.236 --> 01:11:54.059]  I went to buy a bunch of toilet paper and some things before the crowds really hit.
[01:11:54.059 --> 01:11:59.603]  And I had my phone, I had my show going on, sticking it in my pocket so I could hear it.
[01:11:59.603 --> 01:12:02.204]  I wasn't using headphones.
[01:12:02.204 --> 01:12:05.666]  And I, this lady stops and says, who's, who are you listening to?
[01:12:05.666 --> 01:12:06.427]  Who's that talking?
[01:12:07.145 --> 01:12:31.532]  And I expected at first I thought because of where I live it's quite a leftist city and I thought I might get some flack but I said this is Alex Jones and she just got her eyes got wide open and she says really I thought he was off the air and I said no and I told her I explained you know the whole situation and told her where to go she wrote down you know band.video and also Infowars.com and just said he's still on.
[01:12:32.384 --> 01:12:38.808]  And we talked for about 20 minutes about things, and it was really quite a wonderful connection, you know, to have that.
[01:12:38.808 --> 01:12:45.253]  And she was really grateful, and I just, you know, it was great to have that.
[01:12:45.253 --> 01:12:51.597]  And by the way, Alex, I was watching the show when you said something sometime back about sure in your head.
[01:12:52.601 --> 01:12:54.082]  And I kept looking.
[01:12:54.082 --> 01:12:55.122]  I said, when's he going to do that?
[01:12:55.122 --> 01:12:55.962]  When's he going to do that?
[01:12:55.962 --> 01:12:57.203]  And I said, looked at you this morning.
[01:12:57.203 --> 01:12:58.623]  I thought, man, you did it.
[01:12:58.623 --> 01:12:59.884]  And I think you look great.
[01:12:59.884 --> 01:13:01.024]  You know, you look like a warrior.
[01:13:01.024 --> 01:13:01.925]  It's just so much.
[01:13:01.925 --> 01:13:04.065]  It's just such a weight to be off the head.
[01:13:04.065 --> 01:13:06.166]  And so I commend you.
[01:13:06.166 --> 01:13:10.148]  I tell you, I don't really like how it looks, but man, does it feel good?
[01:13:10.148 --> 01:13:10.508]  No, no, no.
[01:13:10.508 --> 01:13:11.428]  It doesn't matter.
[01:13:11.428 --> 01:13:14.889]  I mean, it's beyond beyond that.
[01:13:14.889 --> 01:13:21.772]  And but I I wanted to ask you something about you were talking about the coronavirus.
[01:13:21.772 --> 01:13:22.032]  You know, I
[01:13:22.577 --> 01:13:23.618]  About all kinds of masks.
[01:13:23.618 --> 01:13:28.821]  I went to the Lowe's, you know, about three or four weeks ago and looking for masks.
[01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:33.644]  And I said to the girl, where, you know, where are the N95 masks?
[01:13:33.644 --> 01:13:35.346]  And she said, well, they're right here.
[01:13:35.346 --> 01:13:36.246]  I said, are you selling them?
[01:13:36.246 --> 01:13:38.668]  She said, yeah, we can't keep them in stock.
[01:13:38.668 --> 01:13:44.412]  And I'm in this situation where, you know, we're in the heart of it.
[01:13:44.412 --> 01:13:48.875]  And I just, I'm taking all these things to build my immune system.
[01:13:48.875 --> 01:13:52.257]  I'm pushing 70 years old and I'm
[01:13:53.212 --> 01:13:55.233]  I don't know what to make of it all.
[01:13:55.233 --> 01:13:58.274]  I don't believe what I hear, you know, through the media.
[01:13:58.274 --> 01:14:00.215]  I don't listen to the news anyway.
[01:14:00.215 --> 01:14:04.116]  I get my sources, you know, online and from you.
[01:14:04.116 --> 01:14:07.278]  But I, it's like, have I already got it?
[01:14:07.278 --> 01:14:09.939]  You know, am I exposed?
[01:14:09.939 --> 01:14:17.602]  Well, we know, I mean, you can blame the CDC, Trump, and I'm never for cover-ups, but I get why they're doing it, whether it's Trump or the CDC, but I think Trump's involved, let's just be honest.
[01:14:18.842 --> 01:14:19.923]  They're not sitting out cats.
[01:14:19.923 --> 01:14:21.724]  They sent out faulty ones on purpose.
[01:14:21.724 --> 01:14:22.484]  They know it's been here.
[01:14:22.484 --> 01:14:23.985]  Steve Pachinick's really is smart.
[01:14:23.985 --> 01:14:26.707]  He is tied into special operations and all of them.
[01:14:26.707 --> 01:14:27.347]  And he said it on air.
[01:14:27.347 --> 01:14:28.668]  He said, it's been here for six months.
[01:14:28.668 --> 01:14:30.469]  It's already killed a bunch of people.
[01:14:30.469 --> 01:14:31.970]  And we're just going to make it through it.
[01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:34.731]  So he tries to get ahead of the panic, saying everything's OK.
[01:14:34.731 --> 01:14:38.853]  And I get as a psychiatrist, you know, he doesn't want to yell fire in a theater as an authority figure.
[01:14:38.853 --> 01:14:43.876]  I just think it's important for us to go ahead and just kind of tell people, looks like this is pretty bad.
[01:14:43.876 --> 01:14:46.277]  Because if it is killing 2%, that's no game.
[01:14:47.598 --> 01:14:49.680]  I don't want to say I have, but I haven't gone and gotten tested.
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:51.182]  They won't even really test you.
[01:14:51.182 --> 01:14:51.782]  It's all over the news.
[01:14:51.782 --> 01:14:52.944]  They're just refusing people.
[01:14:52.944 --> 01:15:06.017]  I just hadn't had a cold in almost five years, four plus years, and sure as the devil, man, I've had a fever, went away, came back again, and I've been coughing, coughing, coughing, taking a ton of silver and a bunch of DNA for us.
[01:15:06.017 --> 01:15:10.942]  It looks like it's pretty much gone now, hopefully, but I thought that about a couple days in, three or four weeks ago, then it came back.
[01:15:11.782 --> 01:15:14.443]  Uh, and so, uh, everybody I know is hacking.
[01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:16.244]  There's a bunch of weird stuff going on.
[01:15:16.244 --> 01:15:21.906]  So, again, they could be using the Hunan virus as a cover for other stuff.
[01:15:21.906 --> 01:15:24.026]  I mean, something big's going on, brother.
[01:15:24.026 --> 01:15:26.167]  I really appreciate your call and great points.
[01:15:26.167 --> 01:15:26.807]  That was a great caller.
[01:15:26.807 --> 01:15:29.568]  We just spent two segments with him, but I'm gonna get to everybody else.
[01:15:29.568 --> 01:15:32.609]  Ernie and Jim and Rick and Dennis and Barbara.
[01:15:32.609 --> 01:15:33.990]  In fact, Barbara's up next.
[01:15:33.990 --> 01:15:34.690]  When we come back,
[01:15:35.643 --> 01:15:44.574]  But absolutely, it's crazy how they tried to get us off the air, it didn't work, and now the show is just resurging and exploding.
[01:15:44.574 --> 01:15:47.076]  And the enemy knows that, so they'll probably take a physical shot at me.
[01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:51.762]  So, I am in God's hands, I give it to Jesus, and I have no fear.
[01:15:51.762 --> 01:15:53.264]  I am committed to the Lord's hands.
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:58.562]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[01:15:58.562 --> 01:16:01.484]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[01:16:01.484 --> 01:16:08.708]  Whether it's a big company selling your data, or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.

[01:16:55.037 --> 01:16:58.480]  I'm here with Scott Youseum, founder of OMG Tax.
[01:16:58.480 --> 01:17:03.344]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[01:17:03.344 --> 01:17:09.749]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garnishments sometimes in the same day.
[01:17:09.749 --> 01:17:15.133]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[01:17:15.213 --> 01:17:17.634]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[01:17:17.634 --> 01:17:19.075]  Oh, can I ever?
[01:17:19.075 --> 01:17:24.238]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[01:17:24.238 --> 01:17:24.998]  Guess what?
[01:17:24.998 --> 01:17:30.061]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[01:17:30.061 --> 01:17:40.326]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.

[01:17:40.947 --> 01:17:41.207]  That's 800-486-8112.
[01:17:56.685 --> 01:18:02.207]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[01:18:02.207 --> 01:18:05.628]  Now, could somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong?
[01:18:05.628 --> 01:18:06.188]  Yeah.
[01:18:06.188 --> 01:18:07.909]  Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man.
[01:18:07.909 --> 01:18:08.769]  I love women.
[01:18:08.769 --> 01:18:10.370]  You ought to go out and get a girlfriend.
[01:18:10.370 --> 01:18:11.750]  You may have problems with her.
[01:18:11.750 --> 01:18:13.031]  You may get a divorce.
[01:18:13.031 --> 01:18:13.891]  You may whatever.
[01:18:13.891 --> 01:18:18.672]  The point is, I'm just steering you in the direction I went that was successful when I left.
[01:18:18.672 --> 01:18:22.714]  Well, when it comes to supplements and when it comes to storable foods,
[01:18:23.294 --> 01:18:32.587]  We've got the best out there, because I want you to get a great result, and to come back again and again as a customer, and fund our political, spiritual operations against the globalists.
[01:18:32.587 --> 01:18:38.796]  So if you want storable food that everybody else has sold out, and you want them delivered to your door, and you want them to be high quality, then take action now.
[01:18:39.136 --> 01:18:39.556]  The best product.
[01:18:39.556 --> 01:18:44.799]  I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[01:18:44.799 --> 01:18:45.840]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[01:19:03.868 --> 01:19:05.569]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[01:19:05.569 --> 01:19:07.230]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[01:19:07.230 --> 01:19:08.170]  That was a crazy week.
[01:19:08.170 --> 01:19:19.855]  I don't remember sleeping, but... As far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the InfoWars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, and not relying on other people to do it for you.
[01:19:19.855 --> 01:19:21.156]  Nobody wakes up in the morning...
[01:19:22.662 --> 01:19:25.043]  And thinks, I'm gonna give that person over there a better life.
[01:19:25.043 --> 01:19:26.444]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what?
[01:19:26.444 --> 01:19:30.686]  I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[01:19:30.686 --> 01:19:32.927]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[01:19:32.927 --> 01:19:34.428]  I don't think that happens very often.
[01:19:34.428 --> 01:19:35.229]  It's never happened to me.
[01:19:35.229 --> 01:19:38.150]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[01:19:38.150 --> 01:19:39.851]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[01:19:39.991 --> 01:19:42.754]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[01:19:42.754 --> 01:19:50.741]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com and take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[01:19:50.741 --> 01:19:54.045]  Don't buy into the groupthink, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the TurboForce.
[01:19:54.045 --> 01:19:59.790]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[01:19:59.790 --> 01:20:02.473]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:21.267 --> 01:20:30.829]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:30.829 --> 01:20:36.050]  Everybody knows I've been trying to stabilize the United States and trying to stabilize the planet.
[01:20:36.050 --> 01:20:36.890]  That's what you want.
[01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:39.971]  You want stability for you and your children.
[01:20:39.971 --> 01:20:45.372]  So I don't get up here and say the coronavirus is super bad news just because we have increased viewers.
[01:20:47.938 --> 01:20:51.140]  When I do that, I feel the angel of death flapping around me.
[01:20:51.140 --> 01:20:52.021]  That's bad luck.
[01:20:52.021 --> 01:20:54.622]  I wouldn't do that anyways.
[01:20:54.622 --> 01:20:56.824]  I have children.
[01:20:56.824 --> 01:20:59.946]  You get up there and hope something's bad, so you make money?
[01:20:59.946 --> 01:21:04.328]  You put a big-ass target on your head, that's the analogy of God hitting you with a bolt of lightning.
[01:21:04.328 --> 01:21:04.909]  No!
[01:21:04.909 --> 01:21:06.350]  No!
[01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:07.390]  Here's an example.
[01:21:07.390 --> 01:21:09.652]  We've been all over the country.
[01:21:09.652 --> 01:21:14.875]  In Texas, and in Virginia, and in D.C., and a bunch of other places with the armored vehicle.
[01:21:14.875 --> 01:21:16.276]  Pennsylvania, the list goes on and on.
[01:21:18.427 --> 01:21:22.109]  And the police like us, and we go and bullhorn, and it's a big driving billboard.
[01:21:22.109 --> 01:21:23.149]  It's been very successful.
[01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:25.911]  I want to thank the Lizards for supporting us so we could get it.
[01:21:25.911 --> 01:21:26.811]  We rented it first.
[01:21:26.811 --> 01:21:27.752]  It got huge effect.
[01:21:27.752 --> 01:21:29.172]  Huge national headlines.
[01:21:29.172 --> 01:21:31.694]  I mean, it's incredible.
[01:21:31.694 --> 01:21:34.675]  Paid for itself in four or five events.
[01:21:34.675 --> 01:21:36.476]  We're driving.
[01:21:36.476 --> 01:21:38.197]  We've driven past the Capitol.
[01:21:38.197 --> 01:21:42.659]  I'm bullhorning the corrupt judge, Amy Berman Jackson, who literally rigged the jury and got caught.
[01:21:45.993 --> 01:21:50.120]  I've stopped bullhorning out of the top of the tank.
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:54.727]  And the two drivers, former Special Forces hero Patrick, is a great guys.
[01:21:57.861 --> 01:21:59.342]  Like, man, it's great the cops wave at us.
[01:21:59.342 --> 01:22:01.223]  People drive by holding out your X2 out the window.
[01:22:01.223 --> 01:22:02.404]  You know, they love you.
[01:22:02.404 --> 01:22:03.945]  Man, look at all the black folks.
[01:22:03.945 --> 01:22:04.865]  They seem to be the biggest fans.
[01:22:04.865 --> 01:22:05.946]  I mean, it's just like crazy in D.C.
[01:22:05.946 --> 01:22:07.287]  The black folks are like, there's the black men.
[01:22:07.287 --> 01:22:08.427]  They're almost like, Alex Jones!
[01:22:08.427 --> 01:22:09.468]  Yeah, yeah, Trump!
[01:22:09.468 --> 01:22:09.968]  Roger Stone!
[01:22:09.968 --> 01:22:10.669]  We know it's BS!
[01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:13.190]  I mean, that's why the Democrats are panicking, folks.
[01:22:13.190 --> 01:22:15.151]  30% of black men support Trump.
[01:22:15.151 --> 01:22:16.392]  It's way higher.
[01:22:16.392 --> 01:22:21.655]  The system, because they all knew Trump was an anti-black, was pro-America before.
[01:22:21.655 --> 01:22:24.157]  So the hoax is dropping.
[01:22:24.157 --> 01:22:27.219]  And I literally, I'm sitting in the armored vehicle, drinking some water, driving back to the hotel.
[01:22:29.028 --> 01:22:31.949]  And I go, yeah, it's crazy.
[01:22:31.949 --> 01:22:32.809]  I've been pulled over by the cops.
[01:22:32.809 --> 01:22:33.149]  You're right.
[01:22:33.149 --> 01:22:35.630]  But I said, that's probably bad luck, though, to even say it.
[01:22:35.630 --> 01:22:44.932]  Now, one minute after I say this, the Secret Service pulls over the vehicle behind us.
[01:22:44.932 --> 01:22:48.533]  We had another car trailing us, a black minivan.
[01:22:48.533 --> 01:22:49.474]  We had a Suburban in front of us.
[01:22:52.617 --> 01:22:57.003]  They'd been sent over there, not by Trump, but by whoever put in a false report that we were doing something illegal.
[01:22:57.003 --> 01:22:59.727]  We had other folks claim we had guns on us and were brandishing them.
[01:22:59.727 --> 01:23:01.590]  We later learned that happened in another place.
[01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:04.433]  And the left goes, they're on an armored vehicle pointing guns at us.
[01:23:04.433 --> 01:23:06.616]  Well, here comes the Secret Service, a whole bunch of them.
[01:23:06.616 --> 01:23:07.738]  And at first, they were all tense.
[01:23:09.800 --> 01:23:12.681]  Once they figured out what was going on, they were real nice, we shook hands.
[01:23:12.681 --> 01:23:25.525]  It was the uniformed Secret Service, but they had like six vehicles total that came down on us because some leftists, they wouldn't say what was said, but we learned later at the hotel a leftist said that our guys had guns out.
[01:23:25.525 --> 01:23:28.367]  We had DC police hired that had guns in DC.
[01:23:28.367 --> 01:23:33.268]  Our security guys didn't have guns because even security guys, even cops can't have guns in DC if you're not from DC.
[01:23:33.268 --> 01:23:34.209]  So we were dealing with that.
[01:23:35.714 --> 01:23:37.435]  That's not the reason I'm telling the story.
[01:23:37.435 --> 01:23:44.461]  The minute we said, man, the cops always love us, we never get pulled over, it happened.
[01:23:44.461 --> 01:23:47.023]  So that's this whole tempting fate situation.
[01:23:47.023 --> 01:23:51.106]  And I've not wanted this to be bad.
[01:23:51.106 --> 01:23:53.708]  I said SARS was a bunch of hype.
[01:23:53.708 --> 01:23:57.331]  I've made films how they're going to use bio-attacks for political control to crack down.
[01:23:57.331 --> 01:24:01.074]  But when they really start doing it, I've said it's going to be stronger and stronger.
[01:24:01.074 --> 01:24:04.277]  At first, a little deadly, then more deadly, then more communicable.
[01:24:05.325 --> 01:24:07.146]  And we know the Globals released HIV.
[01:24:07.146 --> 01:24:13.771]  It's a mutation virus that keeps attacking over and over again and attacks the T-lymphocyte white blood cells.
[01:24:13.771 --> 01:24:15.072]  This thing's man-made.
[01:24:15.072 --> 01:24:16.653]  It's got the HIV delivery system.
[01:24:16.653 --> 01:24:18.454]  Yeah, I'm concerned.
[01:24:18.454 --> 01:24:21.777]  But I don't just go off all the intellectual stuff.
[01:24:21.777 --> 01:24:29.962]  Right here, man, I'm pissed at the Globalists and want to tear somebody's head off.
[01:24:29.962 --> 01:24:33.625]  So as a father and as a man, I feel sickeningly angry.
[01:24:34.522 --> 01:24:36.130]  Not the type of anger where you're out of control.
[01:24:36.130 --> 01:24:38.019]  The type of anger where you just tear somebody's head off.
[01:24:38.019 --> 01:24:38.863]  You know what I'm talking about?
[01:24:40.524 --> 01:24:51.491]  And I rarely feel that kind of anger, unless, you know, so my brain looks, my spirit looks at this and just goes, oh, oh, oh, this is bad.
[01:24:51.491 --> 01:24:52.812]  And you now see it.
[01:24:52.812 --> 01:24:56.675]  It's devastating economies around the world, devastating terrorism.
[01:24:56.675 --> 01:24:58.516]  Countries all over are using it to crack down.
[01:24:58.516 --> 01:25:00.197]  Notice Italy's run by authoritarians now.
[01:25:00.197 --> 01:25:01.598]  They took it over from the populist.
[01:25:01.598 --> 01:25:02.198]  China is.
[01:25:02.198 --> 01:25:03.239]  They're all doing it.
[01:25:03.239 --> 01:25:05.321]  So that's why they're shutting down sports stadiums and
[01:25:06.161 --> 01:25:25.838]  Events and all of this but we'd have a discussion about how bad this is really gonna get and what its real motive is and where you think it came from but I Legitimately in the pit of my stomach and just I'm just like I'm not I'm not scared.
[01:25:25.838 --> 01:25:31.904]  I'm like ready to get in the fight and I think that's that's what all this symbolizes You know shaving my head this morning.
[01:25:31.904 --> 01:25:33.105]  I got up and said I'm shaving my head and
[01:25:34.346 --> 01:25:36.387]  And I said, it's just a symbol of we're in a war, folks.
[01:25:36.387 --> 01:25:39.549]  And when you really go into a war, you shave your head so people don't grab your hair.
[01:25:39.549 --> 01:25:42.531]  And that's just an archetypal image of this is not normal.
[01:25:42.531 --> 01:25:44.032]  We're not in normal waters here.
[01:25:44.032 --> 01:25:44.832]  We're in a war.
[01:25:44.832 --> 01:25:46.573]  People better get that through their heads.
[01:25:46.573 --> 01:25:47.434]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:25:47.434 --> 01:25:49.295]  I think you all know that as well.
[01:25:49.295 --> 01:25:50.936]  We don't want to get played into hysteria.
[01:25:50.936 --> 01:25:51.816]  No, no, no.
[01:25:51.816 --> 01:25:55.398]  We're concerned because our gut knows something big's going on.
[01:25:55.398 --> 01:25:56.619]  The question is, what is it?
[01:25:56.619 --> 01:25:58.460]  Barbara in Florida, thanks for holding.
[01:25:58.460 --> 01:25:59.440]  We love you and appreciate you.
[01:25:59.440 --> 01:26:00.181]  What's your take on this?
[01:26:00.862 --> 01:26:07.325]  Hi, well first we want to say we love you and you're saving lives and we thank Jesus for you.
[01:26:07.325 --> 01:26:09.567]  Back at you.
[01:26:09.567 --> 01:26:17.351]  We didn't hear you saying anything about this so we wanted to call two girls from Florida.
[01:26:17.351 --> 01:26:27.536]  Flew back from Milan and we got a breaking news the other night from Channel 13 so we read it and the girls were saying they were sick on the plane.
[01:26:28.459 --> 01:26:35.421]  So when they got to New York to fly to Florida, they stopped because they didn't think they should.
[01:26:35.421 --> 01:26:36.721]  They called the CDC.
[01:26:36.721 --> 01:26:40.562]  CDC didn't know what they were talking about.
[01:26:40.562 --> 01:26:43.503]  Didn't sound like they knew what they were doing.
[01:26:43.503 --> 01:26:52.005]  And they told them, it's okay, you're cleared to go from, we don't know which airport in New York, to Tampa, Florida.
[01:26:52.005 --> 01:26:54.766]  They flew here, they ended up getting tested, they both had it.
[01:26:55.814 --> 01:27:04.698]  So we're just imagining how many people... Ma'am, I did not know about that and that's what I'm being told is we're not being told 1-100 of what's really going on.
[01:27:04.698 --> 01:27:06.159]  Did you see that in the national news?
[01:27:06.159 --> 01:27:07.239]  I never did.
[01:27:07.239 --> 01:27:13.883]  It was a news report out of Channel 13 in Tampa.
[01:27:13.883 --> 01:27:15.623]  Guys, look that up.
[01:27:15.623 --> 01:27:18.325]  A two-woman test positive from a lawn flight in Tampa.
[01:27:18.325 --> 01:27:20.526]  Is that the headline?
[01:27:20.526 --> 01:27:21.786]  Two days ago.
[01:27:21.786 --> 01:27:23.087]  I'm just going with a headline.
[01:27:23.087 --> 01:27:24.908]  Do you remember what the headline was?
[01:27:26.783 --> 01:27:28.705]  Uh, let me ask my husband.
[01:27:28.705 --> 01:27:29.766]  We'll look it up, it's okay.
[01:27:29.766 --> 01:27:35.251]  But was something like two women test positive from flight from Milan?
[01:27:35.251 --> 01:27:44.438]  And they were front, they stopped in New York to call the CDC because they were, they didn't want to get on the flight to Tampa and they were told they should get on the flight to Tampa.
[01:27:44.438 --> 01:27:44.979]  So they did.
[01:27:46.550 --> 01:27:52.071]  But you imagine all the people in both airports that the Baggage Channel is the people there.
[01:27:52.071 --> 01:27:52.832]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:27:52.832 --> 01:27:53.252]  There it is.
[01:27:53.252 --> 01:27:59.693]  Just like you said, out of Florida, Tampa Bay woman who tested positive for coronavirus flew into Tampa International Airport.
[01:27:59.693 --> 01:28:04.174]  The airport said staff had increased cleaning and sanitation on high touch areas.
[01:28:04.174 --> 01:28:05.475]  It's coming out of your nose.
[01:28:05.475 --> 01:28:07.115]  It's coming out of your mouth.
[01:28:07.115 --> 01:28:09.756]  And her sister also tested positive now.
[01:28:09.756 --> 01:28:10.436]  Says two people.
[01:28:10.436 --> 01:28:10.996]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:28:10.996 --> 01:28:12.757]  There's the local Channel 4.
[01:28:12.757 --> 01:28:14.037]  Exactly what you're saying.
[01:28:14.037 --> 01:28:14.217]  Yeah.
[01:28:15.779 --> 01:28:28.004]  So just wanted to let you know, and then there's a third man, and then there's a place in Sarasota that the woman was a nurse for the man that's in the hospital.
[01:28:28.004 --> 01:28:31.345]  By the way, ma'am, as you're saying this, they're pulling up exactly what you're saying.
[01:28:31.345 --> 01:28:33.846]  This has not been in the national news.
[01:28:33.846 --> 01:28:34.646]  Wow.
[01:28:34.646 --> 01:28:35.286]  Wow.
[01:28:35.286 --> 01:28:36.907]  Yeah, we thought it was big.
[01:28:36.907 --> 01:28:40.368]  We're in Fentanyl in North of Tampa.
[01:28:40.368 --> 01:28:44.930]  But we're not going down to Tampa, and thanks to you, we've been getting ready ever since January.
[01:28:46.377 --> 01:28:47.561]  Well thank you Barbara so much.
[01:28:47.561 --> 01:28:49.347]  Tell your husband we really appreciate him as well.
[01:28:49.347 --> 01:28:51.174]  We're going to take more calls to find out what else is going on.
[01:28:51.174 --> 01:28:52.077]  That's why we take these calls.
[01:28:55.455 --> 01:28:56.676]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:56.676 --> 01:29:00.598]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:00.598 --> 01:29:02.138]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:02.138 --> 01:29:05.100]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:10.643]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:10.643 --> 01:29:11.863]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:11.863 --> 01:29:14.785]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:14.785 --> 01:29:17.006]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:17.006 --> 01:29:21.448]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.

[01:29:27.857 --> 01:29:31.598]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.

[01:30:04.585 --> 01:30:06.026]  How bad is it really?
[01:30:06.026 --> 01:30:08.708]  So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high quality, storable foods.

[01:30:14.393 --> 01:30:15.034]  They got the food.
[01:30:15.034 --> 01:30:17.736]  But I want to encourage listeners to do the most important.

[01:31:01.663 --> 01:31:02.243]  Go ahead.
[01:31:02.243 --> 01:31:05.026]  Alex, hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again.
[01:31:05.026 --> 01:31:08.108]  And I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[01:31:08.108 --> 01:31:13.372]  So that's super blue fluoride free toothpaste and that super blue whitening toothpaste is on another level.
[01:31:13.372 --> 01:31:18.536]  I use the one I use the super blue in the morning and then the whitening at night and it absorbs into your gum.
[01:31:18.536 --> 01:31:21.359]  It is by far the best product I've ever used in my life.
[01:31:21.359 --> 01:31:24.001]  I literally just took turbo force on my way to the gym right now.
[01:31:24.381 --> 01:31:32.283]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery, and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[01:31:32.283 --> 01:31:33.624]  So I just want to get that out of the way.
[01:31:33.624 --> 01:31:34.604]  Support this man.
[01:31:34.604 --> 01:31:36.045]  Everything that he exposed.
[01:31:36.045 --> 01:31:37.465]  Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove.
[01:31:37.465 --> 01:31:38.585]  Nobody knew about Epstein.
[01:31:38.585 --> 01:31:39.886]  Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[01:31:39.886 --> 01:31:42.727]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened in July 2001.
[01:31:42.727 --> 01:31:44.387]  Go look it up yourself.
[01:31:44.387 --> 01:31:45.547]  Well, we try our best, sir.
[01:31:45.547 --> 01:31:46.768]  They definitely want us off the air.
[01:31:46.768 --> 01:31:47.668]  Without you, we're not here.
[01:31:47.668 --> 01:31:49.569]  But yeah, these are all great products, so thank you, sir.
[01:31:57.739 --> 01:32:01.002]  This should really be easier than it is.
[01:32:01.002 --> 01:32:03.123]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[01:32:03.123 --> 01:32:05.605]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[01:32:05.605 --> 01:32:18.875]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself you will see how amazing it is and then your support of the product we're selling will help you
[01:32:19.736 --> 01:32:19.796]  Yes.
[01:32:36.152 --> 01:32:41.156]  Eight years ago, I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[01:32:41.156 --> 01:32:48.841]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWareStore.com, and I'm telling you folks, get it.
[01:32:48.841 --> 01:32:50.022]  It's amazing.
[01:32:50.022 --> 01:32:53.605]  Discover the benefits, and it funds the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[01:32:53.605 --> 01:32:59.289]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[01:32:59.289 --> 01:33:01.910]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:13.149 --> 01:33:20.852]  The answer to 1984 is... The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:33:20.852 --> 01:33:24.654]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:24.654 --> 01:33:40.681]  It is my duty as an American citizen sworn to defend against the Satanist operation that this platform launched UKIP to Brexit victory, launched
[01:33:42.765 --> 01:33:53.627]  The new Brazilian president to victory, launched Trump to victory, and has ignited the giant Eastern Europe resistance to the New World Order.
[01:33:53.627 --> 01:34:10.211]  Every one of those leaders has acknowledged that InfoWars was the catalyst to quote, energize and radicalize them, and then created the template messaging blueprint
[01:34:11.311 --> 01:34:14.612]  To carry the fight to victory.
[01:34:14.612 --> 01:34:18.074]  It is my duty to report to you.
[01:34:18.074 --> 01:34:23.416]  My son wants to start a podcast called, I'm Not Bragging.
[01:34:23.416 --> 01:34:26.437]  And I got busy, we never got around to it.
[01:34:26.437 --> 01:34:29.879]  But I always want to say, I'm not tooting my horn about bragging.
[01:34:29.879 --> 01:34:31.760]  That's not what this is.
[01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:36.462]  It'd be like Battle of the Bulge if we turned the Nazis back and finally we're winning the war, or at
[01:34:37.858 --> 01:34:40.640]  What happened in Russia at Stalingrad turned the Nazis back.
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:46.485]  It's not bragging when you announce you're beginning to turn the tide.
[01:34:46.485 --> 01:34:48.147]  And so, it is Twilight Zone.
[01:34:48.147 --> 01:34:55.894]  You know, sometimes I sit there and I think, is this like that 1980s movie?
[01:34:55.894 --> 01:34:56.734]  Total Recall.
[01:34:56.734 --> 01:35:00.398]  Philip K. Dick book.
[01:35:00.398 --> 01:35:01.218]  He was a smart guy.
[01:35:01.218 --> 01:35:02.459]  PKD.
[01:35:05.601 --> 01:35:27.525]  And you got a local cop, and he goes in to have his virtual reality deal where they jack you in, and oh, he wants to be a secret agent, and then they put him in it, and then it totally freaks him out, and secret agents come to kill him, but really he has a psychotic break, and you know, at the end, did he really save Mars, and you know, did they really activate the, you know, the reactor?
[01:35:27.525 --> 01:35:32.326]  And it ends, like a lot of PKD books, the un-teleported man, the list goes on and on.
[01:35:32.326 --> 01:35:33.266]  You don't know
[01:35:34.918 --> 01:35:39.140]  If it was a hallucination from the machine or whether it really happened.
[01:35:39.140 --> 01:35:46.603]  And, but I know you're real, but let me tell you, it's kind of like that, like, okay, and then InfoWars launched, but you kept takeover.
[01:35:46.603 --> 01:35:51.225]  And then we launched Balasaro and then Trump before that, and then it's acknowledged.
[01:35:51.225 --> 01:35:54.107]  But see, it's not Alex Jones that did it.
[01:35:54.107 --> 01:36:02.691]  I was just a focal point and a catalyst and somebody that wanted to go in with good intention and did the right thing, created a system and had a vision that God gave me.
[01:36:02.691 --> 01:36:02.951]  You!
[01:36:05.865 --> 01:36:08.266]  Got the Nationalists and Patriots elected worldwide.
[01:36:08.266 --> 01:36:09.287]  You spread the links.
[01:36:09.287 --> 01:36:10.348]  You spread the articles.
[01:36:10.348 --> 01:36:11.508]  You did the videos.
[01:36:11.508 --> 01:36:12.329]  You spoke up.
[01:36:12.329 --> 01:36:13.249]  You got ridiculed.
[01:36:13.249 --> 01:36:16.892]  And you've done incredible things.
[01:36:16.892 --> 01:36:21.775]  Amazing things.
[01:36:21.775 --> 01:36:27.798]  And that's why they're launching this virus that is the answer.
[01:36:27.798 --> 01:36:30.020]  The answer to 1776 by the 1984 crowd is the coronavirus.
[01:36:37.403 --> 01:36:41.546]  See, we have the answer to 1984 is 1776, but their answer to 1776 is the coronavirus.
[01:36:41.546 --> 01:36:43.467]  Think about that.
[01:37:01.704 --> 01:37:02.904]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:37:02.904 --> 01:37:04.385]  Let's rack them and stack them.
[01:37:04.385 --> 01:37:06.385]  We've got all these great people on here.
[01:37:06.385 --> 01:37:07.446]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:37:07.446 --> 01:37:09.086]  Would it be Rick?
[01:37:09.086 --> 01:37:11.387]  Would it be Jim?
[01:37:11.387 --> 01:37:12.487]  It would be Jim.
[01:37:12.487 --> 01:37:15.008]  And we'll go to Nathaniel, Robert, and everybody else.
[01:37:15.008 --> 01:37:16.689]  Jim in Indiana, thanks for holding it on the air.
[01:37:16.689 --> 01:37:18.189]  Welcome.
[01:37:18.189 --> 01:37:19.469]  Hey, good morning, Alex.
[01:37:19.469 --> 01:37:19.869]  Welcome, sir.
[01:37:22.133 --> 01:37:27.914]  Real quick, thank you for, first of all, may God bless you, your family, your crew, and their families.
[01:37:27.914 --> 01:37:35.395]  And thank you for providing the symbiotic relationship where we provide you with ammunition, you provide us with ammunition.
[01:37:35.395 --> 01:37:37.576]  And I'm going to make two quick points.
[01:37:37.576 --> 01:37:39.116]  Brother, that's how families work.
[01:37:39.116 --> 01:37:40.396]  That's how Christ works.
[01:37:40.396 --> 01:37:41.416]  We're all together.
[01:37:41.416 --> 01:37:44.197]  You can feel the power, can't you?
[01:37:44.197 --> 01:37:46.177]  Yes, sir.
[01:37:46.177 --> 01:37:47.577]  Two quick points.
[01:37:47.577 --> 01:37:50.798]  First of all, I've been hearing a lot, one of the
[01:37:51.641 --> 01:37:55.763]  There's theories out there that this is going to burn itself out when the weather gets warm.
[01:37:55.763 --> 01:37:59.505]  Well, my concern is, when the weather gets warm, what else comes out?
[01:37:59.505 --> 01:38:01.166]  Mosquitoes.
[01:38:01.166 --> 01:38:01.706]  Ticks.
[01:38:01.706 --> 01:38:02.387]  Oh my gosh.
[01:38:02.387 --> 01:38:04.368]  And they can spread it.
[01:38:04.368 --> 01:38:09.890]  What happens when you supercharge mosquitoes with the coronavirus?
[01:38:09.890 --> 01:38:13.172]  How is the weather getting warm going to dull it down?
[01:38:13.172 --> 01:38:16.774]  I think it's going to pump it with nitrous oxide, like a race car.
[01:38:19.517 --> 01:38:21.378]  Man, that's why I love taking calls.
[01:38:21.378 --> 01:38:24.480]  The other caller calls in and brings up angles we hadn't gone with.
[01:38:24.480 --> 01:38:31.104]  Is it an age-specific bioweapon to get rid of retirees ahead of their payouts, which Bill Gates is salivating over?
[01:38:31.104 --> 01:38:35.506]  And then you bring up, they're saying, oh, hopefully, they don't know, hopefully it gets better in warm weather.
[01:38:35.506 --> 01:38:36.727]  It's like the flu, but it's not.
[01:38:36.727 --> 01:38:39.309]  It's like HIV, which doesn't get affected by the temperature.
[01:38:39.309 --> 01:38:41.830]  Warm weather is not going to get rid of it.
[01:38:44.600 --> 01:38:46.881]  And in fact, it could actually make it worse.
[01:38:46.881 --> 01:38:53.885]  And my wife and I have been following you and Mike from the beginning on this, and I haven't heard anybody mention this.
[01:38:53.885 --> 01:38:56.066]  That's why I didn't know you could correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:38:56.066 --> 01:38:59.287]  No, that's why I can't call it, brother, because you just come up with angles.
[01:38:59.287 --> 01:39:03.069]  Like, why didn't I think of that?
[01:39:03.069 --> 01:39:09.272]  Well, that, and you couple that with, well, like, well, obviously, UN, EVO, all that.
[01:39:09.272 --> 01:39:12.154]  Why aren't they telling Erdogan to stand down with this invasion?
[01:39:12.154 --> 01:39:14.115]  So it's like, do you realize we're in a pandemic?
[01:39:15.246 --> 01:39:16.927]  Uh, there's this stuff spreading.
[01:39:16.927 --> 01:39:18.047]  Uh, stop it.
[01:39:18.047 --> 01:39:21.168]  No, they're not saying a dang thing to them.
[01:39:21.168 --> 01:39:23.189]  And, and our borders are wide open.
[01:39:23.189 --> 01:39:25.109]  You guys were just talking about that.
[01:39:25.109 --> 01:39:26.790]  Yes, uh, yesterday.
[01:39:26.790 --> 01:39:29.531]  About, uh, Mr. Rhodes.
[01:39:29.531 --> 01:39:30.731]  The borders are wide open.
[01:39:30.731 --> 01:39:36.473]  Why don't we bring our troops back from Afghanistan, put them on the dang border, seal all four borders.
[01:39:37.290 --> 01:39:38.270]  I totally agree Jim.
[01:39:38.270 --> 01:39:47.873]  What do you make of the EU capitulating to reality and giving 700 plus million dollars and praising Greece stopping on a giant Islamic invasion by Turkey?
[01:39:47.873 --> 01:39:52.775]  I mean finally reality is dawning because Europe is revolting.
[01:39:52.775 --> 01:39:56.256]  Right and then if Trump were to take advantage of this now he could
[01:39:57.116 --> 01:40:02.599]  He could really come out of this on top if he just sticks to what he says he was going to do.
[01:40:02.599 --> 01:40:04.240]  Oh, Pat Buchanan said it last week.
[01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:16.647]  Trump's missing a grand opportunity to prove that globalism is the problem and that nationalism and compartmentalization, freedom but walls to compartmentalize, is the answer.
[01:40:16.647 --> 01:40:18.388]  Good walls make good neighbors.
[01:40:18.388 --> 01:40:19.168]  Thank you so much, sir.
[01:40:19.168 --> 01:40:19.949]  I appreciate your call.
[01:40:20.785 --> 01:40:24.488]  Like firewalls in a ship, or firewalls in an apartment complex.
[01:40:24.488 --> 01:40:27.490]  You put it there, so if a fire starts in one apartment, it doesn't spread to the next.
[01:40:27.490 --> 01:40:28.791]  It's simple.
[01:40:28.791 --> 01:40:30.212]  That's why you put barriers up.
[01:40:30.212 --> 01:40:37.078]  That's why you put speed bumps up in your neighborhood, so some idiot teenager doesn't run your five-year-old over, when they're riding their tricycle, or their bicycle.
[01:40:38.004 --> 01:40:45.568]  I mean, it's, it's, and all the libertarians, and I'm a libertarian in ideas, but they're always like, oh, we need borders, no borders, and everything's too much.
[01:40:45.568 --> 01:40:48.830]  There's other governments spin up and then come attack you.
[01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:50.491]  That's just an organization.
[01:40:50.491 --> 01:40:54.233]  We need government to limit government, very limited, to protect our freedoms.
[01:40:54.233 --> 01:40:55.074]  That's America.
[01:40:56.212 --> 01:41:06.498]  And yeah, we've gotten away from that, but there's not a realism to people that are constantly saying, oh, I'm an anarchic capitalist, I don't want any government.
[01:41:06.498 --> 01:41:08.419]  I want capitalism and the market to side.
[01:41:08.419 --> 01:41:10.100]  Yeah!
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:12.101]  But we don't even have a free market right now.
[01:41:12.101 --> 01:41:21.086]  We have Soros and the globalists rigging everything, and so it's a fascist model living on top of the ruins of a free market system that was never perfect.
[01:41:21.086 --> 01:41:22.927]  It's the ideals we have to strive for.
[01:41:24.193 --> 01:41:27.318]  Always there's people that want the perfection of an idea.
[01:41:27.318 --> 01:41:38.855]  I know so many people will never launch an operation, they'll never go do an interview, they'll never take action because they're always waiting to get it just right and have meetings about it and talk about it all day and then debating, well is it this way or that way theoretically?
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:49.388]  Action is what builds momentum, and what builds force, and what builds destiny, and what builds training in the real universe.
[01:41:49.388 --> 01:41:54.813]  So have good will, study history, ask God for guidance, and then go out and do what's right.
[01:41:54.813 --> 01:41:57.856]  And then as things happen, you can change your angle.
[01:41:57.856 --> 01:42:03.520]  You're always going for justice and truth, but you have to use the systems that are there to then get to the goal.
[01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:06.954]  You have to adapt, and improvise, and overcome.
[01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:20.051]  Not adapt to the tyranny, not adapt by getting on your knees, but adapt by, I can't push that whole thing over right now, but this little enemy, I can start getting strong on this guy, and the next you're toppling this guy, and the next it's this guy, and next it's...
[01:42:21.944 --> 01:42:23.426]  And you know what?
[01:42:23.426 --> 01:42:28.230]  Even if you get destroyed when you take on that big one, everybody else is watching by that example.
[01:42:28.230 --> 01:42:32.895]  And they're not scared when they watch you getting torn apart by the big enemy juggernaut.
[01:42:32.895 --> 01:42:34.076]  That doesn't scare men.
[01:42:34.076 --> 01:42:36.038]  The truth is it inspires them.
[01:42:36.038 --> 01:42:40.141]  And it's in the jaws of the enemy that we find real victory.
[01:42:40.902 --> 01:42:50.435]  It's in that, not wanting to be destroyed, but being willing to do it, that inspires, inspires that spirit, that Alamo spirit, that is unstoppable.
[01:42:50.435 --> 01:42:53.759]  And I am here with you to invoke it.
[01:42:55.180 --> 01:42:55.961]  Everybody needs food.
[01:42:55.961 --> 01:42:57.562]  I'm proud we're selling high-quality food.
[01:42:57.562 --> 01:43:02.785]  Elections, globalism, the economy, the bubble, this is something you need on your checklist to have done.
[01:43:02.785 --> 01:43:07.328]  But for me, it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food.
[01:43:07.328 --> 01:43:15.774]  And I had long discussions this morning, over an hour-long discussion with different individuals at different levels of this, right down to the folks who run the plants, to get the best idea we have.
[01:43:15.774 --> 01:43:16.354]  But they want me to
[01:43:16.374 --> 01:43:16.594]  I don't
[01:43:41.029 --> 01:43:41.489]  I don't know.
[01:43:55.911 --> 01:43:59.892]  It's really smart to get high quality storable food at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:43:59.892 --> 01:44:03.633]  It's also smart to drink filtered water with an Alexa Pure system.

[01:44:06.734 --> 01:44:11.595]  And it's just as important to have your immune system boosted during times like this.

[01:44:34.064 --> 01:44:37.226]  I'm so proud of it, and I had run out of it as well.
[01:44:37.226 --> 01:44:40.649]  So when I got it last week, when it came back in, I was so excited.
[01:44:40.649 --> 01:44:43.310]  It's now available at InfoWarsTore.com.

[01:44:56.219 --> 01:45:02.886]  There's roughly only 260 days left until the 2020 election and already you've seen all sorts of crazy things happen.
[01:45:02.886 --> 01:45:13.456]  The globalists are trying to plunge the economy, they're trying to start wars, they're trying to overthrow the president, they're trying to silence free speech, they're trying to trigger riots in the streets, but everything they do is blowing up in the
[01:45:13.956 --> 01:45:23.280]  We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word, keep countering their lies, and we have to be prepared in case things go south.
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:35.144]  That's why it's so critical to go to InfoWarStore.com and stock up on high-quality preparedness items from storable foods, high-quality water filtration, air filtration, to the very best supplements and silver products you're going to find.

[01:45:43.387 --> 01:45:44.987]  You want to break some globalist ribs?
[01:45:44.987 --> 01:45:46.788]  You want to crush some skulls politically?
[01:45:46.788 --> 01:45:49.188]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually?
[01:45:49.188 --> 01:45:50.929]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[01:45:50.929 --> 01:45:52.769]  There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[01:46:09.124 --> 01:46:09.224]  Yeah.
[01:46:39.264 --> 01:46:41.185]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:47:16.115 --> 01:47:17.256]  Big Brother.
[01:47:17.256 --> 01:47:19.037]  Mainstream media.
[01:47:19.037 --> 01:47:20.938]  Government cover-ups.
[01:47:20.938 --> 01:47:22.639]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:47:22.639 --> 01:47:24.400]  Well, so does he.
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:30.664]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:48.337 --> 01:47:50.178]  It's official.
[01:47:50.178 --> 01:47:52.380]  March 5th, Thursday, 2020.
[01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:55.462]  242 out from the election.
[01:47:55.462 --> 01:47:59.125]  Coronavirus is the big one.
[01:47:59.125 --> 01:48:02.867]  So far, for bioweapons, man-made, creating total fear.
[01:48:02.867 --> 01:48:07.531]  Governments using it to create hysteria and lockdowns of civilization.
[01:48:07.531 --> 01:48:09.252]  Trump trying to play it down.
[01:48:09.252 --> 01:48:10.113]  I understand why.
[01:48:10.113 --> 01:48:11.914]  I can't fault him for it.
[01:48:11.914 --> 01:48:13.915]  But they are suppressing the testing.
[01:48:13.915 --> 01:48:14.916]  They are covering it up.
[01:48:14.916 --> 01:48:15.877]  That's even in the news now.
[01:48:16.778 --> 01:48:23.380]  And the left is using it against the president, just like we predicted.
[01:48:23.380 --> 01:48:28.761]  Listen to this for just a second, this is really good music.
[01:48:28.761 --> 01:48:32.302]  For whom the bell tolls from Ride the Lightning.
[01:48:32.302 --> 01:48:42.705]  I remember listening to this when I was like 12 years old, and I'm like, man, this sounds good.
[01:48:42.705 --> 01:48:44.726]  Alright, let's get back into the news and your phone calls.
[01:48:47.938 --> 01:48:50.459]  But I want to air this just one more time, then I'm going to stop.
[01:48:50.459 --> 01:48:53.461]  I've probably aired it four times already since yesterday.
[01:48:53.461 --> 01:48:59.404]  This is Mike Bloomberg, who is the reverse Howard Hughes.
[01:48:59.404 --> 01:49:05.507]  As our great boom operator John was saying earlier, that's something I stole from him.
[01:49:05.507 --> 01:49:09.509]  Imagine, Howard Hughes would lock himself up, scared of germs.
[01:49:09.509 --> 01:49:11.650]  He'd have sex with prostitutes all day at the same time.
[01:49:11.650 --> 01:49:14.231]  It's a paradox, isn't it?
[01:49:16.107 --> 01:49:19.149]  Then you've got Bloomberg, who's always caught on tape.
[01:49:19.149 --> 01:49:23.331]  Joe Biden likes to kiss little girls on the lips and tell them that they make him horny.
[01:49:23.331 --> 01:49:25.292]  That's audio of that.
[01:49:25.292 --> 01:49:28.413]  Chris Matthews tells a woman that's a guest, you look very beautiful, and he's fired.
[01:49:28.413 --> 01:49:37.158]  I mean, again, just normal human activity is illegal, but, you know, pedophiles having kids bounce on their laps at pedophile story time is okay.
[01:49:37.158 --> 01:49:44.362]  But him sticking his fingers, if you're a radio listener, there's like a buffet he's at, people went to the campaign event, and he's just, they said, oh sir, have some food, so he's like,
[01:49:45.600 --> 01:49:52.424]  Getting food, eating it, licking his fingers, and sticking his fingers back in it like a giant fly.
[01:49:52.424 --> 01:50:00.789]  And again, this is just emblematic of this control freak that wants to run our lives, but he's so tone-deaf that he's got the etiquette of a three-year-old.
[01:50:00.789 --> 01:50:07.653]  Here it is.
[01:50:07.653 --> 01:50:08.794]  He also eats with his mouth open.
[01:50:08.794 --> 01:50:09.234]  Listen to this.
[01:50:19.002 --> 01:50:20.723]  And then he wipes.
[01:50:20.723 --> 01:50:22.004]  Hey, back up a little.
[01:50:22.004 --> 01:50:28.468]  He's wiping his hands on the ice tea pitcher.
[01:50:28.468 --> 01:50:31.530]  Top.
[01:50:31.530 --> 01:50:36.013]  Watch, he puts his hands on where you get your tea from.
[01:50:36.013 --> 01:50:38.515]  Dude, if I saw somebody at a buffet doing that, I'd say, what?
[01:50:38.515 --> 01:50:43.038]  I mean, I'm out of control for it, but hey, dude, do you wash your hands when you wipe your ass?
[01:50:43.038 --> 01:50:44.219]  What is your problem?
[01:50:46.781 --> 01:50:47.381]  That gets worse.
[01:50:47.381 --> 01:50:55.527]  The video goes on, he starts sticking his fingers back in the containers.
[01:50:55.527 --> 01:51:06.755]  And the reason I play it is the creepiness of this dude is evident.
[01:51:06.755 --> 01:51:09.117]  I mean, who raised this person?
[01:51:09.117 --> 01:51:13.020]  And again, that leaves credence that he might be a reptile from Planet Pop-Tart.
[01:51:13.020 --> 01:51:13.360]  Because...
[01:51:16.058 --> 01:51:17.819]  Everything he does is like something a space alien would do.
[01:51:17.819 --> 01:51:19.540]  Like a space alien acts like that.
[01:51:19.540 --> 01:51:25.843]  This guy's worth $78 million and he's like at a buffet, sticking it in his lip.
[01:51:25.843 --> 01:51:26.804]  But I'm gonna stop now.
[01:51:26.804 --> 01:51:27.144]  I'm done.
[01:51:27.144 --> 01:51:29.325]  I'm not playing that again, at least for a while.
[01:51:29.325 --> 01:51:31.546]  Let's move on to another demon, Chuckie Schumer.
[01:51:31.546 --> 01:51:34.988]  Because all these guys don't act normal.
[01:51:34.988 --> 01:51:37.029]  Biden's acting completely insane.
[01:51:37.029 --> 01:51:38.890]  Ah, corn pop!
[01:51:38.890 --> 01:51:41.111]  Vote Thursday on Super Thursday!
[01:51:41.111 --> 01:51:43.633]  I like fly legs and fly hair!
[01:51:43.633 --> 01:51:45.174]  Little black kids and roaches!
[01:51:46.920 --> 01:51:51.882]  You're like, listen to this stuff, and you're like, is this really happening?
[01:51:51.882 --> 01:52:04.766]  But Schumer gets up in a bonafide threat yesterday and says the Supreme Court to Gorsuch and to Kavanaugh, who they've already tried to destroy, and says, we're gonna get you.
[01:52:04.766 --> 01:52:05.786]  You're gonna pay.
[01:52:05.786 --> 01:52:07.907]  Well, you can't impeach him.
[01:52:07.907 --> 01:52:09.507]  They're appointed for life.
[01:52:09.507 --> 01:52:14.049]  You can't, so it's, I mean, folks, I only exposed that the judge
[01:52:17.714 --> 01:52:27.199]  In the Stone case, Judge, the definition of a corrupt judge, dirty Judge Jackson, was appointing Democrat Party officials to head up the jury.
[01:52:27.199 --> 01:52:31.702]  And she had to make one of them step down, and now they caught the second one she put in being just as bad.
[01:52:31.702 --> 01:52:32.542]  He wants me arrested!
[01:52:32.542 --> 01:52:36.244]  And it's been all over the news!
[01:52:36.244 --> 01:52:41.987]  Crooked judge covers for biased and lying juror in Roger Stone case appoints a lawyer.
[01:52:41.987 --> 01:52:42.647]  No one's ever done that.
[01:52:42.647 --> 01:52:44.328]  I checked into it to represent a juror.
[01:52:44.328 --> 01:52:45.009]  The jury's over!
[01:52:46.069 --> 01:52:52.192]  They've already railroaded Stone, but they don't want you to know who they are or the notes they filed when they lied on the jury applications.
[01:52:52.192 --> 01:52:55.494]  Because you know it's just not the two that she first put in that are bad news, man.
[01:52:55.494 --> 01:53:04.679]  It's the whole dirty enchilada, and she's fighting to suppress that!
[01:53:04.679 --> 01:53:07.860]  And is days away from making Stone report to jail.
[01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:08.801]  So here's Chuckie Schumer.
[01:53:10.538 --> 01:53:13.560]  They're all over the news saying, I'm threatening the judge, I'm threatening jurors.
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:18.762]  If I go bullhorn a courthouse and say, you're corrupt and I believe you're bad, that's not intimidating somebody.
[01:53:18.762 --> 01:53:29.068]  But when you say, I'm gonna get you, you're gonna pay, and you're one of the top Democrat senators?
[01:53:29.068 --> 01:53:33.490]  The Chief Justice put out a letter saying, this is a real threat by somebody at your level.
[01:53:33.490 --> 01:53:34.670]  But we will not be intimidated.
[01:53:34.670 --> 01:53:39.593]  That's how crazy the dialogue has gotten in this country, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:53:40.848 --> 01:53:44.370]  But see, why did Chuckie Schumer get so upset?
[01:53:44.370 --> 01:53:48.593]  He always acts like he's half-dead, but we're talking about killing millions of babies a year?
[01:53:48.593 --> 01:53:59.700]  The demon in that man just gets all excited over that blood of those babies, and he wants that goody, and his daddy Satan tells him, you get up there, demon, and you threaten them.
[01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:01.861]  I want more dead kids!
[01:54:01.861 --> 01:54:03.582]  I want to dehumanize people!
[01:54:03.582 --> 01:54:05.223]  I want no value on human life!
[01:54:05.223 --> 01:54:07.825]  So you get up there, you red pajama devil!
[01:54:09.013 --> 01:54:13.035]  And you get me more babies!
[01:54:13.035 --> 01:54:20.019]  Or you and Governor Northam are going to be exposed.
[01:54:20.019 --> 01:54:23.662]  Keep those babies coming and keep them comfortable.
[01:54:23.662 --> 01:54:25.463]  Here he is.
[01:54:25.463 --> 01:54:28.204]  And they're taking away fundamental rights.
[01:54:28.204 --> 01:54:30.525]  I want to tell you, Gorsuch.
[01:54:30.525 --> 01:54:32.667]  I want to tell you, Kavanaugh.
[01:54:32.667 --> 01:54:37.850]  You have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price.
[01:54:41.670 --> 01:54:47.555]  You won't know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.
[01:54:47.555 --> 01:54:50.798]  Yeah, just like you said, the intelligence agencies have seven ways to Sunday.
[01:54:50.798 --> 01:54:51.378]  To what?
[01:54:51.378 --> 01:54:52.339]  Get Trump.
[01:54:52.339 --> 01:54:55.221]  And then they committed a bunch of crimes to try to get him.
[01:54:55.221 --> 01:54:56.482]  And he still hasn't got in trouble.
[01:54:56.482 --> 01:54:57.643]  So he's so arrogant now.
[01:54:57.643 --> 01:55:02.827]  Hell, he'll probably call the same Kavanaugh as a Russian agent.
[01:55:02.827 --> 01:55:03.868]  Robert stood up to him.
[01:55:03.868 --> 01:55:05.470]  He's probably a Russian agent now too, huh?
[01:55:06.519 --> 01:55:11.283]  Everybody's a Russian agent, but you dirty Democrats that openly have told us you hate this country.
[01:55:11.283 --> 01:55:15.446]  We're going to go to... Who's been home the longest here?
[01:55:15.446 --> 01:55:20.771]  We're going to go to Dennis and then Rick and then Nathaniel, Robert and Dan here in a moment ahead of our big guest joining us.
[01:55:20.771 --> 01:55:22.692]  Francis Boyle with huge coronavirus developments.
[01:55:22.692 --> 01:55:23.553]  Please tell people to tune in.
[01:55:23.553 --> 01:55:24.574]  That's how we reach more people.
[01:55:24.574 --> 01:55:26.435]  You are the resistance with this.
[01:55:27.523 --> 01:55:35.815]  Callers call in all the time and they go, uh, man, I, um, actually finally ordered some of your X2 or X3 or your TurboForce, your RainForce, your knockout.
[01:55:35.815 --> 01:55:37.397]  It works incredibly good.
[01:55:37.397 --> 01:55:38.479]  Well, I thought it was BS.
[01:55:38.479 --> 01:55:40.081]  What, because the news said it was BS?
[01:55:41.047 --> 01:55:47.851]  I don't know of anyone that puts as much high-quality energy and product into a pack as this, and it's pretty much over the top.
[01:55:47.851 --> 01:55:50.672]  Most people take a quarter or a half, and it's like five, six hours of energy.
[01:55:50.672 --> 01:55:53.314]  It's ten hours of clean energy for the average metabolic system.
[01:55:53.314 --> 01:55:54.875]  It's insane.
[01:55:54.875 --> 01:55:59.817]  No one in the industry that we can find has put as much product in something as we have with TurboForce.
[01:55:59.817 --> 01:56:00.618]  It's been sold out.
[01:56:00.618 --> 01:56:01.498]  It's back in stock.
[01:56:01.498 --> 01:56:02.559]  Forty percent off.
[01:56:02.559 --> 01:56:03.700]  Get yours at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:09.023]  I don't know if jacking your metabolic system up like this boosts your immune system, though.
[01:56:09.023 --> 01:56:10.344]  I'm not going to tell you that.
[01:56:10.344 --> 01:56:13.926]  But the DNA Force Plus back in stock, 40% off, does on record.
[01:56:13.926 --> 01:56:15.327]  And we have all the super silver products.
[01:56:15.327 --> 01:56:17.769]  And we still have food that we're able to ship.
[01:56:17.769 --> 01:56:20.190]  But it's such back order, we've got to package it.
[01:56:20.190 --> 01:56:20.911]  But we have it.
[01:56:20.911 --> 01:56:21.711]  Other folks don't.
[01:56:21.711 --> 01:56:23.773]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:56:23.773 --> 01:56:25.053]  But there is a wait.
[01:56:25.053 --> 01:56:26.574]  Okay.
[01:56:26.574 --> 01:56:33.039]  Let's go ahead and go to... You know, let's not cut Dennis and Rick.
[01:56:34.099 --> 01:56:34.860]  Sure.
[01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:42.190]  We're gonna go to them next segment, give them each about two minutes, and then we'll get to the others while we have Dr. Boyle on with us today.
[01:56:42.190 --> 01:56:48.819]  And yeah, a lot of folks want me to comment about my new hairstyle, or lack thereof.
[01:56:49.793 --> 01:56:53.154]  Uh, you know, I've always not liked messing with my hair.
[01:56:53.154 --> 01:56:54.715]  And it used to be nice and thick and pretty.
[01:56:54.715 --> 01:56:57.736]  Well, I was just almost as handsome as Owen 20 years ago.
[01:56:57.736 --> 01:56:59.697]  I even had a duck's ass in my hair.
[01:56:59.697 --> 01:57:00.197]  But you know what?
[01:57:00.197 --> 01:57:00.917]  I can't compete with Owen.
[01:57:00.917 --> 01:57:05.379]  So, I just saw his duck's ass the other day here on air and I just was so blown away by it.
[01:57:05.379 --> 01:57:06.919]  It looked like Elvis was in there.
[01:57:06.919 --> 01:57:11.821]  I said, the only way to counter Superman and Superman hair is Lex Luthor.
[01:57:11.821 --> 01:57:14.802]  And so, Owen bowed up and he said, my hair is more powerful than yours.
[01:57:14.802 --> 01:57:16.263]  And I said, okay!
[01:57:16.263 --> 01:57:16.663]  That's it!
[01:57:17.881 --> 01:57:19.962]  Lex Luthor is coming!
[01:57:19.962 --> 01:57:24.385]  And now, you'll face it.
[01:57:24.385 --> 01:57:32.050]  Truth is, I just said I need to shave my head as a message to folks that things are different here, and things are crazy.
[01:57:32.050 --> 01:57:33.371]  And so, I did it.
[01:57:33.371 --> 01:57:34.051]  And it is weird, man.
[01:57:34.051 --> 01:57:40.496]  I've never done it before, and not since I was a baby was I as bald as a Q. In fact, when I was born, I had a little bit of blonde hair.
[01:57:40.496 --> 01:57:43.177]  So let me tell you, I'm as naked as I've ever been.
[01:57:43.177 --> 01:57:43.958]  Like a mole rat.
[01:57:46.283 --> 01:57:47.064]  Real stuff, man.
[01:57:47.064 --> 01:57:48.225]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[01:57:48.225 --> 01:57:53.690]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[01:57:53.690 --> 01:57:56.552]  Everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[01:57:56.552 --> 01:57:58.274]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[01:57:58.274 --> 01:58:01.497]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[01:58:02.057 --> 01:58:05.319]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[01:58:05.319 --> 01:58:07.141]  20 different stickers.
[01:58:07.141 --> 01:58:08.762]  Impeach the Democrats.
[01:58:08.762 --> 01:58:09.843]  Save the Second Amendment.
[01:58:09.843 --> 01:58:10.923]  Defend the First Amendment.
[01:58:10.923 --> 01:58:12.264]  Infowars.com.
[01:58:12.264 --> 01:58:14.426]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[01:58:14.426 --> 01:58:19.169]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[01:58:19.169 --> 01:58:20.791]  People say, why are you doing this?
[01:58:20.791 --> 01:58:21.311]  What's happening?
[01:58:21.311 --> 01:58:22.852]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[01:58:22.852 --> 01:58:25.094]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[01:58:25.094 --> 01:58:28.196]  And Dr. Puccinich, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet.
[01:58:28.456 --> 01:58:29.236]  Brilliant.
[01:58:29.236 --> 01:58:36.320]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made it into a weapon.
[01:58:36.320 --> 01:58:39.281]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[01:58:39.281 --> 01:58:42.103]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[01:58:42.103 --> 01:58:45.925]  Silence.
[01:58:45.925 --> 01:58:47.646]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[01:58:47.646 --> 01:58:49.747]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer.
[01:58:49.747 --> 01:58:51.508]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[01:58:51.508 --> 01:58:53.249]  But I'll be honest with you.
[01:58:53.249 --> 01:58:57.611]  We run, during the breaks, a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[01:58:58.587 --> 01:59:00.453]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[01:59:00.453 --> 01:59:01.757]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[01:59:01.757 --> 01:59:02.500]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:59:03.516 --> 01:59:04.976]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[01:59:04.976 --> 01:59:07.677]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[01:59:07.677 --> 01:59:08.837]  I don't want them to win.
[01:59:08.837 --> 01:59:11.758]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[01:59:11.758 --> 01:59:14.858]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[01:59:14.858 --> 01:59:18.019]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[01:59:18.019 --> 01:59:21.540]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[01:59:21.540 --> 01:59:23.380]  These will change your life.
[01:59:23.380 --> 01:59:24.800]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:26.801]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[01:59:26.801 --> 01:59:27.501]  Check it all out.
[01:59:27.501 --> 01:59:29.441]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[01:59:29.441 --> 01:59:31.222]  Be part of the second American revolution.
[01:59:31.222 --> 01:59:32.422]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[01:59:32.802 --> 01:59:34.783]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:05.803 --> 02:00:06.523]  Yes, thank you.
[02:00:32.600 --> 02:00:36.381]  Hey Alex, it's my first time caller ever, you know.
[02:00:36.381 --> 02:00:47.804]  But what I want to get at is the Chuckles, the Clown Schumer, and Pelosi, the Vodka Drunk, and the Obama Holdover that brought sick people back.
[02:00:47.804 --> 02:00:49.705]  Absolutely, they're the herpes of Obama.
[02:00:49.705 --> 02:00:51.625]  They just keep giving and giving.
[02:00:51.625 --> 02:00:56.807]  Yeah, see what gets me is they don't give a damn about the American people.
[02:00:56.807 --> 02:00:57.667]  They don't.
[02:00:57.667 --> 02:00:58.007]  They don't.
[02:00:58.803 --> 02:01:01.245]  Well, in fact, they don't just dislike America.
[02:01:01.245 --> 02:01:04.007]  They hate us because we won't submit to them.
[02:01:04.007 --> 02:01:12.914]  Well, see, another thing, too, is my uncle, all my uncles and my dad, everybody fought in World War II.
[02:01:12.914 --> 02:01:27.246]  And my Uncle Jim always said, now this is way back in 71, 72-ish, you know, that he said that Russia would take over America without firing a bullet.
[02:01:27.246 --> 02:01:28.167]  I mean, I mean,
[02:01:28.832 --> 02:01:31.272]  And so far, he's been right on everything.
[02:01:31.272 --> 02:01:32.613]  Well, let's be clear.
[02:01:32.613 --> 02:01:35.693]  The globalist leftists had taken over Russia in 1917.
[02:01:35.693 --> 02:01:40.054]  So the same globalist group was actually using Russia to attack us.
[02:01:40.054 --> 02:01:41.354]  But I wouldn't even say it was the Russians.
[02:01:41.354 --> 02:01:44.575]  It was that communist globalist group.
[02:01:44.575 --> 02:01:44.935]  Oh, yeah.
[02:01:44.935 --> 02:01:45.575]  I'll tell you what.
[02:01:45.575 --> 02:01:50.896]  See, I want to tell him myself now.
[02:01:50.896 --> 02:01:53.456]  Back in the day, I used to vote Democrat.
[02:01:53.456 --> 02:01:54.537]  Used to.
[02:01:54.537 --> 02:01:56.317]  That was back during
[02:01:57.642 --> 02:02:00.705]  Clinton's first term and after that... But see, don't count on yourself.
[02:02:00.705 --> 02:02:03.427]  People didn't know how bad Democrats were back then.
[02:02:03.427 --> 02:02:05.408]  Republicans were bluebloods and bad then too.
[02:02:05.408 --> 02:02:07.110]  I mean, it's just now we have Trump.
[02:02:07.110 --> 02:02:08.311]  It's a little more populist.
[02:02:08.311 --> 02:02:09.172]  There's a better choice.
[02:02:09.172 --> 02:02:10.533]  But I mean, yeah, exactly.
[02:02:10.533 --> 02:02:15.677]  I don't blame anybody who voted Democrat before, as long as people now see what's happening.
[02:02:15.677 --> 02:02:21.962]  Yeah, see, what gets me is why... Well, see, I blame it basically on our academia.
[02:02:21.962 --> 02:02:23.163]  You think about it.
[02:02:23.163 --> 02:02:26.566]  Right now, our academics only teach the liberal
[02:02:27.765 --> 02:02:30.487]  Communist ideology and not academics.
[02:02:30.487 --> 02:02:35.970]  I mean, they've done already got past the academic part of it.
[02:02:35.970 --> 02:02:43.234]  Yeah, they teach a neoliberal system to sabotage real nationalism, real liberalism, real conservatism, anything authentic.
[02:02:43.234 --> 02:02:43.674]  God bless you.
[02:02:43.674 --> 02:02:44.654]  Thanks for the call.
[02:02:44.654 --> 02:02:45.695]  Rick in Colorado.
[02:02:45.695 --> 02:02:46.475]  You're on the air.
[02:02:46.475 --> 02:02:48.657]  Welcome, sir.
[02:02:48.657 --> 02:02:50.458]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[02:02:50.458 --> 02:02:50.858]  Thank you, sir.
[02:02:51.752 --> 02:02:54.637]  Hey, first off, I wanted to say that I've bought storable food.
[02:02:54.637 --> 02:03:00.226]  I've bought a lot of products, but the best thing I've ever bought from you was the Alexa Pure Water System.
[02:03:00.226 --> 02:03:03.731]  I've got one for my daughter with my grandkids, and that thing is the best thing.
[02:03:03.731 --> 02:03:06.296]  It's better than any bottled water or anything you can get.
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:09.341]  Well, it's top-rated by third-party groups.
[02:03:09.341 --> 02:03:11.582]  People go, why is yours the best?
[02:03:11.582 --> 02:03:13.283]  Because it's really low-priced and the best.
[02:03:13.283 --> 02:03:14.564]  Why the hell wouldn't I sell some?
[02:03:14.564 --> 02:03:17.326]  People ask, why does Jones always sell the best products?
[02:03:17.326 --> 02:03:18.446]  Because that's what I use.
[02:03:18.446 --> 02:03:21.768]  Whatever we go out and thinks the best, I strike a deal with them and that's what I sell.
[02:03:21.768 --> 02:03:23.930]  It's not rocket science.
[02:03:23.930 --> 02:03:24.310]  I agree.
[02:03:25.242 --> 02:03:34.191]  The thing I wanted to say was I haven't heard anybody even comment on what's going to happen to the prison systems if this corona breaks out in the prisons.
[02:03:34.191 --> 02:03:37.195]  Prison here in Colorado and you know a lot of big big-time convicts are in there and
[02:03:48.396 --> 02:03:49.637]  You know, the guards get sick.
[02:03:49.637 --> 02:03:51.017]  Who's going to replace the guards?
[02:03:51.017 --> 02:03:52.578]  And what happens in the prison systems?
[02:03:52.578 --> 02:03:55.119]  Because it'll fly around like a petri dish in them.
[02:03:55.119 --> 02:03:56.239]  You just said it.
[02:03:56.239 --> 02:04:06.823]  Boy, there's footage I haven't aired yet of a homeless person eating poop that DrudgeReport.com linked to, and I meant to start the show with it, but I just... viewer discretion is advised, but we're talking about a petri dish.
[02:04:06.823 --> 02:04:12.025]  We're going to get to that when we come back with Dr. Francis Boyle here, and we'll get to Robert and Nathaniel and Dan.
[02:04:12.025 --> 02:04:13.886]  Rick, what are you and your family doing to get prepared?
[02:04:15.287 --> 02:04:20.220]  Well, I've always been a prepper, but you know, I got my daughters on board and all that.
[02:04:20.220 --> 02:04:22.667]  And I mean, we don't go crazy and go insane, but.
[02:04:23.496 --> 02:04:28.919]  You know, I have all the essentials and everything I need to take care of me and my family, and that's all I care about.
[02:04:28.919 --> 02:04:34.322]  Well, you know, the most important thing is a relationship with God and guns and being willing to use it.
[02:04:34.322 --> 02:04:34.982]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:34.982 --> 02:04:35.742]  We love you.
[02:04:35.742 --> 02:04:39.484]  It comes down to God, guts, and family, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:39.484 --> 02:04:41.305]  God, guts, and family.
[02:04:41.305 --> 02:04:43.627]  You got that, you got everything.
[02:04:43.627 --> 02:04:47.128]  We'll be right back with Dr. Francis Boyle and breaking news.
[02:04:47.128 --> 02:04:47.709]  Stay with us.
[02:04:47.709 --> 02:04:49.049]  Infowars.com.
[02:04:49.049 --> 02:04:50.070]  Tomorrow's news today.
[02:04:54.727 --> 02:04:55.587]  Rich in Alabama.
[02:04:55.587 --> 02:04:56.728]  Rich, thanks for calling.
[02:04:56.728 --> 02:04:57.448]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[02:04:57.448 --> 02:04:58.228]  Appreciate it.
[02:04:58.228 --> 02:05:00.889]  First thing, I love the turbo force.
[02:05:00.889 --> 02:05:04.451]  I drive truck for a living, and it's amazing.
[02:05:04.451 --> 02:05:09.293]  Coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end, but that turbo force is amazing.
[02:05:09.293 --> 02:05:11.854]  How is turbo force different than coffee?
[02:05:11.854 --> 02:05:12.674]  I'll tell you what.
[02:05:12.674 --> 02:05:12.754]  It's
[02:05:13.234 --> 02:05:16.778]  Sustainable, anywhere from 8-10 hours.
[02:05:16.778 --> 02:05:20.322]  I don't feel the jitters like I do drinking coffee.
[02:05:20.322 --> 02:05:24.167]  And it's just, you know, at the end of the day, I don't need anything to go to bed.
[02:05:24.167 --> 02:05:27.510]  I'll, you know, I'll pop a knockout, and boom, I'm out cold.
[02:05:28.131 --> 02:05:34.994]  So that's when we went out to a top developer who didn't want his name on it, and I said, what would the ultimate long, say, 10-hour energy be?
[02:05:34.994 --> 02:05:36.315]  Is that possible?
[02:05:36.315 --> 02:05:42.178]  That's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy that are healthy and natural that are time-released.
[02:05:42.178 --> 02:05:45.500]  And there's more money in it than anybody else puts in their product.
[02:05:45.500 --> 02:05:48.842]  So that's why TurboForce has such a great effect.
[02:05:48.842 --> 02:05:51.503]  And so I really appreciate you, and I'm glad that you like TurboForce.
[02:06:05.129 --> 02:06:22.060]  I am a shotgun rider for the San Jacinto Line The desert is my brother, my skin is cracked and dry I was riding on a cold coast and everything was fine Till we took a shorter road to save some time
[02:06:24.062 --> 02:06:29.190]  We're gonna go to Dr. Francis Boyle here in just a moment who...
[02:06:39.241 --> 02:06:46.768]  There's only two people out there that have done more in the last five weeks exposing this accurately, and that's Dr. Francis Boyle and Mike Adams.
[02:06:46.768 --> 02:06:48.690]  I mean, they're just right at the tip of the spear.
[02:06:48.690 --> 02:06:59.139]  The Indian Institute that came out and scanned it and said it was man-made with a gene and the RNA of the delivery system of HIV, that's been confirmed now.
[02:06:59.139 --> 02:07:01.682]  And what's the big new developments here?
[02:07:01.682 --> 02:07:02.923]  This is just unbelievable.
[02:07:04.042 --> 02:07:04.342]  Yes, sir.
[02:07:32.341 --> 02:07:34.842]  Yeah, I work at the airport.
[02:07:34.842 --> 02:07:39.244]  We haven't had any kind of work, because normally we'll get word from security and whatnot.
[02:07:39.244 --> 02:07:42.785]  I haven't even heard anything from staff, because we work in the food industry.
[02:07:42.785 --> 02:07:47.507]  Me and my wife, we both work here actually, and we both work on the airside.
[02:07:47.507 --> 02:07:52.909]  And normally, any time a thing happens, we get first word, right directly from security.
[02:07:52.909 --> 02:07:54.950]  We haven't gotten anything yet.
[02:07:54.950 --> 02:07:58.172]  As I was going to state about the lady that called earlier, Barbara.
[02:07:59.958 --> 02:08:05.863]  About being careful with, like you talk about sometimes with these false flag news reports that they have.
[02:08:05.863 --> 02:08:10.226]  You know, we have not had no word on any of that stuff in our report yet.
[02:08:10.226 --> 02:08:17.251]  And, like, two nights ago, a whole news thing from ABC Action News over here in Hillsborough County.
[02:08:17.251 --> 02:08:25.097]  They're in front of a Dollar Tree talking about, you know, there's no supplies, anything, everything's sold out, signs are on the windows.
[02:08:25.097 --> 02:08:25.838]  I was there today.
[02:08:25.838 --> 02:08:27.259]  Everything's in stock.
[02:08:27.259 --> 02:08:28.700]  There's nothing wrong at all.
[02:08:29.266 --> 02:08:32.628]  Like, there's nothing in the stores that are out of stock.
[02:08:32.628 --> 02:08:38.611]  You know, more so on the news end, they're doing a bunch of fear-mongering, because you really don't hear anything about that over here.
[02:08:38.611 --> 02:08:48.997]  Now, however, there is a case, though, in Hillsborough County, where I'm at, but this is all the way around Mango County, and where my mother stays in Sarasota, there's one case.
[02:08:48.997 --> 02:08:56.521]  But so far, as far as the airport goes, we haven't had any kind of communication with security, Homeland Security, TSA, anything like that.
[02:08:58.527 --> 02:08:59.728]  Well, thank you so much, Robert.
[02:08:59.728 --> 02:09:00.769]  I appreciate your call.
[02:09:00.769 --> 02:09:07.396]  And obviously, I've seen hundreds of videos, so have you, of grocery stores and Costco's and big lines of people outside.
[02:09:07.396 --> 02:09:08.517]  Those are real.
[02:09:08.517 --> 02:09:14.464]  A lot of the footage, though, looks like employees, because they all are kind of being directed, but they're in plainclothes throwing
[02:09:17.000 --> 02:09:18.421]  Carts full of things.
[02:09:18.421 --> 02:09:28.746]  And that was an old trick on that 50 years ago, is a toy maker about two months before Christmas would pay off a local newscaster to go and say, this doll or this toy is sold out here.
[02:09:28.746 --> 02:09:30.867]  There's runs on Cabbage Patch dolls.
[02:09:30.867 --> 02:09:33.028]  And then it would cause a run nationwide.
[02:09:33.028 --> 02:09:35.529]  Sold out, sold out.
[02:09:35.529 --> 02:09:38.870]  And so yeah, a lot of this looks fake.
[02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:42.512]  In fact, if you look, that's a bunch of Costco workers doing it.
[02:09:42.512 --> 02:09:44.133]  Costco, welcome to Costco, I love you.
[02:09:45.058 --> 02:09:46.079]  As they say in Idiocracy.
[02:09:46.079 --> 02:09:46.699]  So, yeah.
[02:09:46.699 --> 02:09:49.521]  In fact, the crew is so good, I didn't even tell them to do that.
[02:09:49.521 --> 02:09:51.423]  I never even told them I thought that was fake.
[02:09:51.423 --> 02:09:57.407]  They knew out of, like, probably 50 videos they've got of that, they pulled out the one that looks fake.
[02:09:57.407 --> 02:09:58.828]  The others look real.
[02:09:58.828 --> 02:09:59.808]  That's like HUMET, man.
[02:09:59.808 --> 02:10:02.690]  They didn't even need to know which one I was talking about.
[02:10:02.690 --> 02:10:04.131]  They just, boom, went to it.
[02:10:04.131 --> 02:10:06.653]  So, yeah, that's fake right there, folks.
[02:10:06.653 --> 02:10:09.115]  The issue here, though, is... Let's go back to the camera here.
[02:10:12.711 --> 02:10:16.013]  The huge response by the Chinese Communist.
[02:10:16.013 --> 02:10:17.394]  Over 100 dead in Italy.
[02:10:17.394 --> 02:10:18.975]  The lockdown of all their schools.
[02:10:18.975 --> 02:10:20.596]  It crippling air travel.
[02:10:20.596 --> 02:10:23.337]  It crippling the supply chain.
[02:10:23.337 --> 02:10:24.518]  That's real.
[02:10:24.518 --> 02:10:26.019]  Whether it's an over response or not, it's real.
[02:10:26.019 --> 02:10:27.780]  And we know it's man-made.
[02:10:27.780 --> 02:10:32.983]  We know the genetic engineers look at it and clearly they can see where it was inserted, it was built, different families of viruses.
[02:10:32.983 --> 02:10:37.585]  This is ridiculously phony, like plastic banana or a $3 bill.
[02:10:38.746 --> 02:10:42.048]  So Dr. Francis Boyle is a Ph.D.
[02:10:42.048 --> 02:10:45.810]  lawyer, teaches major college at Harvard, top Ph.D.
[02:10:45.810 --> 02:10:47.531]  I'm not going to go into his whole background.
[02:10:47.531 --> 02:10:48.192]  Author of the U.S.
[02:10:48.192 --> 02:10:50.753]  Law on Bioweapons that got adopted by the U.N.
[02:10:50.753 --> 02:10:54.555]  And he's been, for five weeks here, charting what's happening.
[02:10:54.555 --> 02:10:56.236]  He's been dead on.
[02:10:56.236 --> 02:11:03.140]  So the best thing to do is just turn over the next five minutes and we'll come back with a 10-minute segment to Dr. Francis Boyle, who took off teaching.
[02:11:03.140 --> 02:11:06.362]  We appreciate him to be here and lay out the newest developments.
[02:11:06.362 --> 02:11:07.503]  But can you just recap
[02:11:09.160 --> 02:11:14.984]  The latest approximation of exactly what this is, where it came from, and what we're facing.
[02:11:14.984 --> 02:11:18.406]  Well, okay, Alex, thank you for having me on.
[02:11:18.406 --> 02:11:23.069]  Obviously, we've done several interviews here before.
[02:11:23.069 --> 02:11:34.277]  I can't recap all of that, but I did want to make some current observations for your listeners, your viewers, to decide for themselves.
[02:11:35.254 --> 02:11:46.257]  As you know, last week, President Trump had a press conference where he brought in his team dealing with this.
[02:11:46.257 --> 02:11:54.799]  And when it was all over, they proceeded to march out stage left.
[02:11:54.799 --> 02:11:57.139]  Sorry, their stage right.
[02:11:57.139 --> 02:11:59.880]  And as they were going out,
[02:12:00.854 --> 02:12:21.605]  The director of the CDC, Redfield, stopped, turned and looked at the American people, smirked, and then said, it's perfectly safe for everyone to fly to Washington, Oregon, and California.
[02:12:21.605 --> 02:12:23.466]  About two hours later,
[02:12:24.677 --> 02:12:31.103]  Uh, the state of Washington declared a coronavirus emergency.
[02:12:31.103 --> 02:12:37.709]  So they knew that was coming and tried to block it or tried to like overshadow it?
[02:12:37.709 --> 02:12:42.514]  Well, Alex, you can interpret that however you want, but... Well, you're a smart guy.
[02:12:42.514 --> 02:12:44.335]  How do you interpret it?
[02:12:44.335 --> 02:12:48.219]  I think he's an idiot between you and me, first, and second,
[02:12:48.726 --> 02:13:03.068]  I think this criminal malpractice by the CDC, which is typical because we have to understand the CDC has been up to its eyeballs in this Nazi biological warfare work.
[02:13:03.715 --> 02:13:12.584]  Since the Reagan administration, under the influence of... I'm sorry to direct you here, but let's recap with what you broke that was hiding in plain view three weeks ago here.
[02:13:12.584 --> 02:13:15.527]  Science Journal, others reported five years ago the U.S.
[02:13:15.527 --> 02:13:19.631]  allowed the transfer of this very virus, the Chimera, of the type to China.
[02:13:19.631 --> 02:13:23.215]  So to me, that's kind of epicenter of investigation, or am I wrong?
[02:13:23.215 --> 02:13:25.397]  Like, we should look at that.
[02:13:25.397 --> 02:13:26.798]  You're perfectly correct, Alex.
[02:13:28.448 --> 02:13:38.093]  University of North Carolina lab should be shut down immediately by state and local law enforcement authorities.
[02:13:38.093 --> 02:13:42.275]  It should be sealed to preserve the evidence.
[02:13:42.275 --> 02:13:52.781]  And everyone involved in this coronavirus gain-of-function Nazi biological warfare activity
[02:13:54.062 --> 02:14:07.170]  Should be investigated by law enforcement authorities and interrogated and I think prosecuted for violating my Biological Weapons Anti-Terrorism Act of 1989 that provides for life imprisonment.
[02:14:11.977 --> 02:14:20.602]  But the point of my story is, Alex, we cannot trust the CDC to do the right thing here.
[02:14:20.602 --> 02:14:22.463]  And how did you know that?
[02:14:22.463 --> 02:14:24.844]  It's not tooting your horn, but it shows your knowledge.
[02:14:24.844 --> 02:14:26.485]  How did you know a month ago they were covering it up?
[02:14:26.485 --> 02:14:30.667]  Because that's now admitted that they've been covering up and not letting people get tested and all of this.
[02:14:33.078 --> 02:14:53.911]  Well, actually, it just goes back to my involvement in trying to stop DNA genetically engineering biological warfare by the United States government, starting shortly after the Council for Responsible Genetics asked me to serve as their
[02:14:54.611 --> 02:14:58.976]  You've not been following it, you've been right at the center of it.
[02:15:15.117 --> 02:15:16.138]  That's correct.
[02:15:16.138 --> 02:15:19.019]  You know, I'm not here to toot my horn one way or the other.
[02:15:19.019 --> 02:15:21.761]  No, but we need to say somebody's expertise when they're on.
[02:15:21.761 --> 02:15:28.445]  I mean, somebody's an expert in a certain type of brain surgery or somebody invented something, you have them on, say this is the inventor or this is a top person.
[02:15:28.445 --> 02:15:30.346]  So we just need to state that, like you've been right at the center of this.
[02:15:30.346 --> 02:15:35.629]  When we come back, let's project forward then on what we currently are seeing, the new developments with Dr. Francis Boyle.
[02:15:35.629 --> 02:15:41.432]  We'll try to give him the floor when we come back, but I just got so many questions for him because I got four children, man, at the end of the day.
[02:15:41.752 --> 02:15:43.215]  I don't give a damn about myself.
[02:15:43.215 --> 02:15:45.219]  I mean, I just, any parent knows that.
[02:15:45.219 --> 02:15:48.305]  But my children, I just, I'm really concerned.
[02:15:48.305 --> 02:15:49.728]  I'm just gut level.
[02:15:49.728 --> 02:15:50.670]  Aren't you concerned, folks?
[02:15:53.243 --> 02:15:58.988]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.

[02:16:04.092 --> 02:16:11.838]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[02:16:11.838 --> 02:16:19.704]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[02:16:19.864 --> 02:16:21.666]  Not a security IPO or note.

[02:16:45.206 --> 02:16:47.910]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk.
[02:16:47.910 --> 02:16:49.913]  Owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[02:16:49.913 --> 02:16:52.437]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.

[02:18:53.913 --> 02:18:59.717]  I wanted to talk about Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[02:18:59.717 --> 02:19:03.439]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[02:19:03.439 --> 02:19:05.600]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:07.401]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[02:19:07.401 --> 02:19:09.002]  So here I am telling people.
[02:19:09.762 --> 02:19:19.909]  Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried and I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free.
[02:19:19.909 --> 02:19:31.437]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the Coral Calcium because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean and the toothpaste, I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[02:19:31.437 --> 02:19:33.818]  It feels so good.
[02:19:33.818 --> 02:19:36.880]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:39.182]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth
[02:19:39.922 --> 02:19:43.064]  Three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now.
[02:19:43.064 --> 02:19:56.733]  Because I like the way it feels.
[02:19:56.733 --> 02:19:59.375]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:24.447 --> 02:20:27.248]  Alright, Dr. Francis Boyle, author of the U.S.
[02:20:27.248 --> 02:20:36.191]  Biological Weapons Law, was then adopted by the United Nations.
[02:20:54.815 --> 02:20:57.604]  I'll stop asking questions for now and do some recaps.
[02:20:57.604 --> 02:21:01.275]  The current developments, what you think is really happening now, the latest info you have.
[02:21:03.263 --> 02:21:08.405]  Well, again, Alex, let me just go back to President Trump's press conference.
[02:21:08.405 --> 02:21:12.867]  And since then, we've been inundated by all these comments.
[02:21:12.867 --> 02:21:17.269]  I've already dismissed the CDC and Redfield.
[02:21:17.269 --> 02:21:26.273]  They're completely, fatally compromised to give any reputable advice to the American people.
[02:21:26.273 --> 02:21:31.796]  We've also been inundated by interviews with Tony Fauci.
[02:21:32.563 --> 02:21:56.469]  Well, on that University of North Carolina smoking gun I already provided to you, where it is clear the Chinese government paid for access to the Nazi biological warfare work at the University of North Carolina and took it back to them, it clearly says, quote, research in this manuscript
[02:21:56.949 --> 02:22:05.382]  Was supported by grants from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, whose director is Tony Fauci.
[02:22:05.382 --> 02:22:09.488]  So Fauci is up to his eyeballs in this.
[02:22:09.488 --> 02:22:11.110]  He's lying about it.
[02:22:11.110 --> 02:22:12.152]  He's covering it up.
[02:22:12.910 --> 02:22:16.593]  He's doing damage control and damage limitations.
[02:22:16.593 --> 02:22:19.055]  We cannot believe one word he said.
[02:22:19.055 --> 02:22:20.076]  By the way, let me just stop you.
[02:22:20.076 --> 02:22:21.757]  I said I wouldn't interrupt, but I'm going to.
[02:22:21.757 --> 02:22:23.458]  You started saying this three weeks ago.
[02:22:23.458 --> 02:22:25.860]  So I went and looked into who Fauci is.
[02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:31.424]  He's been there for 40 years, involved in all this secretive operations.
[02:22:31.424 --> 02:22:36.548]  So I didn't realize just how prestigious he is in all this illegal operations.
[02:22:36.548 --> 02:22:39.491]  I mean, he has run basically biological weapons operations.
[02:22:39.491 --> 02:22:39.851]  Am I wrong?
[02:22:41.673 --> 02:22:46.035]  You're correct for NIAID and the National Institutes of Health.
[02:22:46.035 --> 02:22:51.879]  And likewise, we really can't trust these people at the National Institutes of Health.
[02:22:51.879 --> 02:23:07.988]  This UNC Wuhan Virology Lab also says, supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health, along with the National Science Foundation of China.
[02:23:08.664 --> 02:23:11.666]  So they're up to their eyeballs in this too.
[02:23:11.666 --> 02:23:15.468]  Let me also comment on the Surgeon General.
[02:23:15.468 --> 02:23:22.453]  The Surgeon General wrote an op-ed piece saying, well, the American people don't need face masks.
[02:23:22.453 --> 02:23:24.014]  That's just preposterous.
[02:23:24.014 --> 02:23:29.677]  There's a brand new article just came out from China today.
[02:23:29.677 --> 02:23:33.640]  China scientists saying, quote,
[02:23:36.827 --> 02:24:01.825]  If the neuroinvasion of SARS-CoV-2 does take a part in the development of respiratory failure in COVID-19 patients, which they established, the precaution with masks will absolutely be the most effective measure to protect against the possible entry of the virus into the central nervous system.
[02:24:03.214 --> 02:24:07.657]  So, obviously, he's not telling the truth to us either.
[02:24:07.657 --> 02:24:08.958]  And by the way, I've got to stop you again.
[02:24:08.958 --> 02:24:12.521]  This is like somebody at the Indy 500 saying cars don't need tires.
[02:24:12.521 --> 02:24:17.725]  I'm not a scientist or a top bioweapons lawyer like you, but I've studied the virus.
[02:24:17.725 --> 02:24:18.525]  I know it's very small.
[02:24:18.525 --> 02:24:20.327]  It goes down deep into the lungs.
[02:24:20.327 --> 02:24:22.729]  And that, obviously, it's very small.
[02:24:22.729 --> 02:24:24.410]  Technically, it can go through a mask.
[02:24:24.410 --> 02:24:27.052]  But it's going to be carried in some water vapor.
[02:24:27.052 --> 02:24:29.594]  It's going to be carried in some spittle or a sneeze.
[02:24:30.234 --> 02:24:33.257]  A lot of it will get caught and blocked in the nose, but not in the throat.
[02:24:33.257 --> 02:24:35.799]  It'll go down the windpipe into the lungs.
[02:24:35.799 --> 02:24:38.242]  And so, of course, a high-end mask.
[02:24:38.242 --> 02:24:39.663]  It's like we sell water filters.
[02:24:39.663 --> 02:24:42.966]  They cut back 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9 percent, depending on the thing.
[02:24:42.966 --> 02:24:46.149]  It's better to cut down the 9, 9.9, 9, 9, 9, 9.
[02:24:46.149 --> 02:24:50.293]  The idea of, well, they could technically, the virus is so small, it could go through.
[02:24:50.293 --> 02:24:52.055]  Isn't that a red herring canard, doctor?
[02:24:53.806 --> 02:24:59.869]  Well, the Chinese scientists who are over there dealing with it say you have to have masks.
[02:24:59.869 --> 02:25:01.670]  What else can I say?
[02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:06.912]  So why the hell would Trump's people be saying no masks?
[02:25:06.912 --> 02:25:15.277]  Well, Alex, I just think we're getting criminal malpractice by the Trump advisors.
[02:25:15.277 --> 02:25:17.258]  That's all I can say.
[02:25:17.258 --> 02:25:19.659]  And in the case, certainly in the case of
[02:25:20.771 --> 02:25:24.672]  Fauci and the CBC and the NIH.
[02:25:24.672 --> 02:25:28.513]  This is all covering your rear end.
[02:25:28.513 --> 02:25:31.794]  And by the way, you're being politically agnostic here, right?
[02:25:31.794 --> 02:25:33.114]  You're not against or for.
[02:25:33.114 --> 02:25:44.757]  You're just reporting what you see here, that this is really a danger to America and Trump, that he's letting all these insiders, like he did with the neocons, running Russiagate, like he did with Fiona Hill and all these people.
[02:25:44.757 --> 02:25:45.918]  We warned him then, didn't we?
[02:25:48.228 --> 02:25:49.409]  Well, you're correct, Alex.
[02:25:49.409 --> 02:25:50.750]  I'm a political independent.
[02:25:50.750 --> 02:25:53.311]  To be honest with you, I didn't vote for Mrs. Clinton.
[02:25:53.311 --> 02:25:55.713]  I didn't vote for Mr. Trump.
[02:25:55.713 --> 02:26:01.797]  I usually pick a third party, so I'm not here to beat up on President Trump.
[02:26:01.797 --> 02:26:06.620]  Sure, you're telling it like it is, because some callers are like, hey, why are you bashing Trump?
[02:26:06.620 --> 02:26:08.001]  I'm just talking reality here.
[02:26:08.001 --> 02:26:08.562]  That's all we do.
[02:26:09.724 --> 02:26:10.004]  Right.
[02:26:10.004 --> 02:26:19.253]  And then finally, Alex, we have the Health and Human Services Secretary Azar that I told you before we agreed.
[02:26:19.253 --> 02:26:24.398]  He's an employee and lobbyist for the drug industry.
[02:26:24.398 --> 02:26:33.466]  So in this latest bill that was just passed by Congress, he made sure, you can read this in today's New York Times,
[02:26:34.196 --> 02:26:46.864]  That there will be no bulk sales free of charge to any anti-COVID therapeutics or cures or anything else to the American people.
[02:26:46.864 --> 02:26:53.769]  We are going to have to pay the drug companies whatever outrageous, exorbitant rates they charge us.
[02:26:53.769 --> 02:26:55.150]  Let's pull back from that.
[02:26:55.150 --> 02:26:58.272]  They're saying there's not going to be any government backing.
[02:26:58.272 --> 02:27:00.654]  When you want welfare, this is when you do it during a pandemic.
[02:27:01.548 --> 02:27:06.932]  No welfare, no helping the public during an emergency.
[02:27:06.932 --> 02:27:09.053]  It's not going to be provided free of charge.
[02:27:09.053 --> 02:27:09.694]  That's correct.
[02:27:09.694 --> 02:27:16.499]  You'll have to rely upon your insurance company if you have one, and if you don't, then too bad for you.
[02:27:16.499 --> 02:27:21.162]  Likewise, we see these enormous restrictions
[02:27:21.952 --> 02:27:30.736]  That the CDC has placed on coronavirus testing that, you know, technically they say they've just removed.
[02:27:30.736 --> 02:27:38.820]  Well, they're doing 10,000 tests a day in South Korea, and so far we've had 500 tests in America.
[02:27:38.820 --> 02:27:39.620]  Why?
[02:27:39.620 --> 02:27:50.526]  Again, I think this damage control, damage livertration, covering their own rear ends, and not being honest with the American people.
[02:27:51.426 --> 02:28:06.597]  Professor, I think you're dead on, and you're a top expert on this, and I get why Trump wants to play it down, he wants to save the stock market, but like China did, the covering up of it up front, I think creates more insecurity when it becomes apparent that it's deadly.
[02:28:06.597 --> 02:28:08.799]  You're right, Alex.
[02:28:08.799 --> 02:28:14.743]  Obviously, we're not as bad as communist China when it comes to propaganda.
[02:28:15.362 --> 02:28:31.214]  But I hate to say it, our mainstream news media is not much better, which is why I come here and give you my interviews, because at least you let me say what I want, you ask me some questions, you challenge me.
[02:28:31.214 --> 02:28:32.875]  Well, that's fine.
[02:28:32.875 --> 02:28:40.821]  I always get a fair and honest interview with you, where I've been completely blackballed off of mainstream news media ever since I started.
[02:28:40.821 --> 02:28:42.162]  Well, that shows you're doing the right thing.
[02:28:42.162 --> 02:28:42.682]  Stay there.
[02:28:42.682 --> 02:28:43.203]  I've got a few
[02:28:43.923 --> 02:28:44.766]  Selfish questions.
[02:28:44.766 --> 02:28:49.959]  I know you're trying to tell people how to protect themselves and what the White House should do, but I want to know about the Providence, where it came from.
[02:28:49.959 --> 02:28:50.962]  You've been spot-on about that.
[02:28:50.962 --> 02:28:51.443]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:53.519 --> 02:28:56.521]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[02:28:56.521 --> 02:28:59.442]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[02:28:59.442 --> 02:29:06.646]  Whether it's a big company selling your data, or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.
[02:29:06.646 --> 02:29:11.888]  That's why you need FlashRouters, a custom Wi-Fi router created for privacy.
[02:29:11.888 --> 02:29:19.492]  FlashRouters uses a virtual private network, or VPN, to protect your online activity from hackers, trackers, and large corporations.

[02:29:54.179 --> 02:30:02.443]  I also want to say that I'm happy to be helping out with an enterprise that is supported by all the work to help people be prepared.
[02:30:02.443 --> 02:30:09.406]  And instead of just giving into sickness care, take care of their health, take care of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality.
[02:30:09.406 --> 02:30:11.507]  And I say that from personal experience.
[02:30:11.647 --> 02:30:26.534]  Because I know that the products that are being offered here, I've tried them and I use them every day, and that power pack that they have, the AM-PM power pack, well I wouldn't be so energetic this morning, except that I have been on a regular customer in that regard.
[02:30:26.534 --> 02:30:35.699]  I just wanted to start out by saying that, because I think it's important to remember that beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help equip people to think about these great events in the world,
[02:30:35.959 --> 02:30:48.604]  One of the priorities has to be to take care of yourself, remembering that our lives are a gift from God that he intends us to use for good purpose, for our families and for our communities.
[02:30:48.604 --> 02:30:53.886]  And right now, folks who are willing to think like we do are critical to the future of America.
[02:30:55.103 --> 02:30:57.543]  We know that the globalists are in trouble.
[02:30:57.543 --> 02:31:04.545]  Humanity's waking up to their tyranny, how they run their scams, their Ponzi schemes, how they're building a post-human world.
[02:31:04.545 --> 02:31:06.365]  But we know they're going to strike back.
[02:31:06.365 --> 02:31:21.588]  And the UN has said that they're going to absolutely implode third world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the West and collapse our social services in a giant cloward and piven program.
[02:31:22.068 --> 02:31:29.937]  The UN also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government, inner coronavirus.
[02:31:29.937 --> 02:31:37.005]  This is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading the word because people
[02:31:37.005 --> 02:31:47.229]  People are waking up like never before, but this fight against tyranny is neck and neck, so spread the word about Band.Video and Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:31:47.229 --> 02:31:49.229]  That is so important.
[02:31:49.229 --> 02:31:51.730]  You are at the center of the resistance.
[02:31:51.730 --> 02:31:53.131]  You are our only hope.
[02:31:54.011 --> 02:31:55.052]  Everybody's calling me.
[02:31:55.052 --> 02:32:02.380]  I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really deadly?
[02:32:02.380 --> 02:32:03.822]  How bad is it really?
[02:32:03.822 --> 02:32:06.525]  So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get Hi-Quality Swirlable Foods.
[02:32:06.525 --> 02:32:09.488]  We have the only company, the biggest in the nation, that actually still has food.
[02:32:09.488 --> 02:32:12.211]  It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got to package it.
[02:32:12.211 --> 02:32:12.852]  They got the food.
[02:32:12.852 --> 02:32:15.555]  But I want to encourage listeners to do the most important thing.
[02:32:15.815 --> 02:32:17.256]  And that's drink purified water.
[02:32:17.256 --> 02:32:17.976]  That's pray.
[02:32:17.976 --> 02:32:18.656]  That's get focused.
[02:32:18.656 --> 02:32:20.517]  That's not be stressed out because you're prepared.
[02:32:20.517 --> 02:32:28.060]  And that's get DNA Force Plus, the PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans out the mitochondria and the cells and is the biggest immune booster you can engage in.
[02:32:28.060 --> 02:32:30.422]  The X2, the X3, the foundation, everything.
[02:32:30.422 --> 02:32:34.843]  The Ultra 12 back in stock are nano silver, super silver and super blue toothpaste.
[02:32:34.843 --> 02:32:35.304]  It's still 50% off.
[02:32:36.104 --> 02:32:41.127]  Tumeric is known for doing a super job when it comes to cleaning out your cells.
[02:32:41.127 --> 02:32:43.888]  We have the strongest tumeric you're going to find out there.
[02:32:43.888 --> 02:32:45.689]  95% humanoid from bodies, ultimate tumeric formula.
[02:32:45.689 --> 02:32:46.610]  That's back in stock.
[02:32:46.610 --> 02:32:50.051]  And purchases at mfulworthstore.com are the highest quality supplements, desirable food.
[02:32:50.051 --> 02:32:52.913]  And you actually get them delivered in stock at mfulworthstore.com.
[02:32:52.913 --> 02:32:57.695]  So get those today.
[02:32:57.695 --> 02:33:00.297]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:13.624 --> 02:33:18.649]  He never gives up.
[02:33:18.649 --> 02:33:20.711]  He's Alex Jones.
[02:33:20.711 --> 02:33:23.835]  Broadcasting from deep in the heart of Texas.
[02:33:23.835 --> 02:33:24.395]  Worldwide.
[02:33:27.332 --> 02:33:34.495]  I'm not going to belabor this, but we have storable food, and we have it at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:33:34.495 --> 02:33:39.737]  We have great supplements that boost your immunity that you need regardless in this crazy world.
[02:33:39.737 --> 02:33:42.017]  All the other big manufacturers for four weeks have been sold out.
[02:33:42.017 --> 02:33:44.198]  They're lying to you, saying one-week delivery.
[02:33:44.198 --> 02:33:45.259]  That's not true.
[02:33:45.259 --> 02:33:48.680]  It's five to eight weeks, depending on what you order, when it's the storable foods.
[02:33:48.680 --> 02:33:51.601]  We're ready to ship the next day with the supplements.
[02:33:52.381 --> 02:33:57.586]  Like the turmeric and the DNA Force Plus at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:33:57.586 --> 02:34:00.910]  InfoWarsTore.com and that funds our operation.
[02:34:00.910 --> 02:34:02.632]  Okay, Dr. Boyle, author of the U.S.
[02:34:02.632 --> 02:34:05.494]  Biological Weapons Law, then got adopted by the U.N.
[02:34:07.163 --> 02:34:09.945]  I can see what a great professor you are and how you're a professional.
[02:34:09.945 --> 02:34:12.787]  Like my dad is a doctor, a medical doctor.
[02:34:12.787 --> 02:34:19.351]  You just try to lay out the current crisis and the fact that stuff's not being done right and you're just saying this is wrong.
[02:34:19.351 --> 02:34:22.573]  But everybody wants to know the providence.
[02:34:22.573 --> 02:34:28.036]  And the media is ignoring the Journal of Science five years ago saying Obama sold to China.
[02:34:28.036 --> 02:34:30.338]  They're ignoring the Institute saying it's man-made.
[02:34:30.338 --> 02:34:33.280]  But we can force that out.
[02:34:34.218 --> 02:34:36.098]  You're an expert in law and all this stuff.
[02:34:36.098 --> 02:34:38.379]  I'm an expert on how to get stuff out.
[02:34:38.379 --> 02:34:41.680]  If we can get it's providence out, who's it's daddy?
[02:34:41.680 --> 02:34:44.520]  And what it's endgame is, was it an accident?
[02:34:44.520 --> 02:34:46.120]  Was it on purpose?
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:49.421]  What does the evidence point towards right now?
[02:34:49.421 --> 02:34:54.942]  People want to know where this creature came from.
[02:34:54.942 --> 02:35:03.364]  Well, Alex, as you know, I gave that interview to Mr. Schroyer for a half hour and then two more.
[02:35:03.883 --> 02:35:04.664]  I don't think so.
[02:35:34.216 --> 02:35:52.642]  That was originally developed there at the University of North Carolina lab using the SARS coronavirus, which was already weaponized to begin with, and endowing it with gain-of-function properties.
[02:35:52.642 --> 02:35:56.364]  Indeed, it even travels through air, Alex.
[02:35:56.364 --> 02:36:00.045]  It's not just a question of droplets.
[02:36:00.045 --> 02:36:03.686]  That's why human excrement
[02:36:04.660 --> 02:36:07.942]  Uh, can spread this disease.
[02:36:07.942 --> 02:36:27.170]  We've had reports of that coming out of Hong Kong and China now, that when people poop in the toilet and flush the chain, and if the lines are not secure on the way down, it can spread this disease.
[02:36:27.170 --> 02:36:32.012]  And at UNC, it's clear China
[02:36:32.699 --> 02:36:48.247]  bought its way into that Nazi biological warfare work and took that Nazi biological warfare technology back with it to Wuhan in order to weaponize it.
[02:36:48.247 --> 02:36:51.488]  And I believe that that's what happened here.
[02:36:51.488 --> 02:36:55.110]  So far, I believe it was a leak that these
[02:36:55.839 --> 02:36:58.501]  BSL-4, BSL-3 facilities leaked.
[02:36:58.501 --> 02:37:04.185]  Even Fort Detrick, which is a BSL-4, had a leak and had to shut down.
[02:37:04.185 --> 02:37:07.387]  But regardless, that's why they're so scared it's a known bioweapon.
[02:37:07.387 --> 02:37:10.289]  Did you see where Merkel tried to shake hands with her Interior Minister?
[02:37:10.289 --> 02:37:10.729]  He wouldn't.
[02:37:10.729 --> 02:37:13.471]  I think what you're saying is it's not about shaking hands, it's in the air.
[02:37:15.051 --> 02:37:15.611]  That's correct.
[02:37:15.611 --> 02:37:18.073]  It's not just in the hands, but it's in the air.
[02:37:18.073 --> 02:37:19.634]  You're exactly correct.
[02:37:19.634 --> 02:37:24.478]  And so that is why it is so infectious.
[02:37:24.478 --> 02:37:35.766]  Indeed, there's another report just came out today from Los Alamos that one carrier can infect anywhere from five to seven other people.
[02:37:35.766 --> 02:37:41.890]  So you don't even have to shake someone's hands or be hit with a droplet.
[02:37:41.890 --> 02:37:44.012]  But Alex, let me say what I think
[02:37:44.764 --> 02:38:08.237]  We could do today, which is that I don't believe we can trust this team there in Washington, D.C., this team of feds who are up to their eyeballs in this, to properly advise the American people on how to protect themselves and their families from this.
[02:38:08.237 --> 02:38:08.517]  I would
[02:38:09.176 --> 02:38:33.833]  suggest that what needs to be done is the American people have to get organized on a state and local basis, even going down to cities and communities and villages and whatever, and put together a team of experts, medical doctor, microbiologist, public health official,
[02:38:34.734 --> 02:38:46.143]  And be sure to do your due diligence on them and make sure that they have not accepted one penny of Nazi biological warfare work
[02:38:46.858 --> 02:38:53.719]  from the United States government, because otherwise they're just going to sabotage whatever you're trying to do.
[02:38:53.719 --> 02:38:56.260]  And of course we can't believe the WHO either.
[02:38:56.260 --> 02:38:58.340]  We know they're up to their eyeballs here.
[02:38:58.340 --> 02:39:06.982]  This Wuhan BSL-4 was a WHO specially designated research laboratory.
[02:39:06.982 --> 02:39:13.583]  Yeah, research on the development, testing, and stockpiling of Nazi biological warfare weapons.
[02:39:14.003 --> 02:39:16.984]  So, we're going to have to do this for ourselves, Alex.
[02:39:16.984 --> 02:39:18.224]  We're going to have to go out.
[02:39:18.224 --> 02:39:20.365]  We're going to have to get our own experts.
[02:39:20.365 --> 02:39:23.566]  They are going to have to evaluate the situation.
[02:39:23.566 --> 02:39:29.288]  Of course, I guess they can listen to what CDC, Fauci, WHO is telling them.
[02:39:29.828 --> 02:39:33.730]  But I don't think they should pay attention to it.
[02:39:33.730 --> 02:39:40.432]  I think they need to make the judgments on their own, just like the state of Washington did, right?
[02:39:40.432 --> 02:39:51.516]  You had that CDC director say, oh, you American people go right ahead and fly out to Washington and Oregon and California.
[02:39:51.516 --> 02:39:56.318]  And two, three hours later, Washington declares a state of emergency.
[02:39:56.318 --> 02:39:58.279]  So we have to act
[02:39:58.974 --> 02:39:59.174]  I think?
[02:40:29.294 --> 02:40:30.756]  We know the federal government is doing that.
[02:40:30.756 --> 02:40:34.619]  So bringing this up, Dr. Boyle, look at Communist China.
[02:40:34.619 --> 02:40:36.400]  They weren't able to cover up.
[02:40:36.400 --> 02:40:38.442]  And look at other countries like Italy.
[02:40:38.442 --> 02:40:39.323]  They're not going to cover up.
[02:40:39.323 --> 02:40:40.624]  So I agree with you.
[02:40:40.624 --> 02:40:42.145]  They're not going to be able to cover this up.
[02:40:42.145 --> 02:40:47.910]  So what do you see speculating coming out of this?
[02:40:47.910 --> 02:40:54.496]  Well, Alex, right now, I think we are facing an American coronavirus pandemic.
[02:40:54.496 --> 02:40:55.156]  That's clear.
[02:40:55.156 --> 02:40:57.138]  This is going to sweep all over the country.
[02:40:58.519 --> 02:41:11.367]  And it won't, it's not going to be, I guess our government is not going to be able to do the same things that Communist China did, but the federal government very well might try.
[02:41:11.367 --> 02:41:13.068]  Right.
[02:41:13.068 --> 02:41:13.848]  What can I say?
[02:41:13.848 --> 02:41:20.332]  But I think, you know, the genie is now out of the bottle due to the criminal malpractice and incompetence
[02:41:20.931 --> 02:41:21.331]  I don't
[02:41:41.025 --> 02:41:45.807]  Uh, and doing damage control and damage limitation from the begin.
[02:41:45.807 --> 02:41:49.129]  And I'm not here bashing President Trump.
[02:41:49.129 --> 02:41:51.490]  I don't really know what President Trump knows.
[02:41:51.490 --> 02:41:52.070]  Exactly!
[02:41:52.070 --> 02:41:53.711]  We're just reporting what the facts are.
[02:41:54.850 --> 02:41:55.130]  Right.
[02:41:55.130 --> 02:41:58.112]  I mean, the people he has around him are worthless.
[02:41:58.112 --> 02:42:00.834]  They are more dangerous than worthless.
[02:42:00.834 --> 02:42:11.201]  And to be fair, again, Sean Farrah, I also seriously attacked President Obama for the way he handled that Ebola
[02:42:12.612 --> 02:42:13.333]  All right.
[02:42:13.333 --> 02:42:13.753]  Thank you.
[02:42:29.502 --> 02:42:37.544]  Projecting out the numbers, if there is a cover up, how bad it's going to get for death versus supply chain.
[02:42:37.544 --> 02:42:48.647]  And as long as it gets out of law and science, it's more like there's, I have footage when we come back of East Coast and West Coast ship ports are usually full or just empty of the containers.
[02:42:48.647 --> 02:42:50.067]  What does that signify?
[02:42:50.067 --> 02:42:51.368]  We'll talk about it when we come right back.
[02:42:51.368 --> 02:42:51.708]  Stay with us.
[02:42:54.653 --> 02:42:57.894]  This should really be easier than it is.
[02:42:57.894 --> 02:43:00.035]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[02:43:00.035 --> 02:43:02.516]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[02:43:02.516 --> 02:43:06.097]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work.
[02:43:06.097 --> 02:43:11.539]  That if you listen to me and try them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is.
[02:43:11.539 --> 02:43:15.781]  And then your support of the product we're selling will help you
[02:43:16.661 --> 02:43:16.801]  I hope
[02:43:33.067 --> 02:43:38.069]  Eight years ago, I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[02:43:38.069 --> 02:43:45.753]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at infowarestore.com, and I'm telling you folks, get it.
[02:43:45.753 --> 02:43:46.914]  It's amazing.
[02:43:46.914 --> 02:43:50.515]  Discover the benefits, and it funds the InfoWar, a 360 win.
[02:43:50.515 --> 02:43:53.477]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[02:43:53.477 --> 02:43:55.398]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[02:43:55.398 --> 02:44:00.340]  Coronavirus is a man-made bio-weapon designed to destroy nation-states,
[02:44:02.927 --> 02:44:03.727]  We're good to go.
[02:44:28.997 --> 02:44:32.178]  That's how major this is.
[02:44:32.178 --> 02:44:33.919]  Everyone needs to be prepared.
[02:44:33.919 --> 02:44:37.621]  2020 is not a year to play games.
[02:44:37.621 --> 02:44:46.864]  InfoWars will continue to report the latest information as it comes out, regardless of the fact that the establishment will try to punish us for telling the truth.
[02:44:46.864 --> 02:44:52.487]  We need you to step to the plate and help spread the word about Bandot Video and InfoWars.com today.
[02:44:54.369 --> 02:44:56.191]  We always promote being prepared.
[02:44:56.191 --> 02:45:02.136]  Having firearms, knowing how to use them, and be self-sufficient, and learn how to hunt, and learn how to garden.
[02:45:02.136 --> 02:45:03.678]  I mean, it's just, it's what we're meant to do.
[02:45:03.678 --> 02:45:04.919]  It feels good when we do it.
[02:45:04.919 --> 02:45:06.821]  But we do sell high-quality, affordable food.
[02:45:06.821 --> 02:45:10.004]  I told my Patriot a month ago, I said, what can you handle?
[02:45:10.004 --> 02:45:10.965]  I said, I think it's gonna be really big.
[02:45:10.965 --> 02:45:12.426]  And they said, well, we can handle probably this.
[02:45:12.426 --> 02:45:15.589]  We're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund.
[02:45:15.589 --> 02:45:17.031]  I said, no, I think this is going to be huge.
[02:45:17.031 --> 02:45:20.995]  I think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more food, even though the prices are going up for you.
[02:45:20.995 --> 02:45:22.237]  So those are the type of discussions we had.
[02:45:22.237 --> 02:45:24.279]  I'm just giving the inside baseball of all of us.
[02:45:24.279 --> 02:45:27.382]  This is a hundred times regular volume plus.
[02:45:27.382 --> 02:45:28.724]  It was a hundred times a few days ago.
[02:45:28.724 --> 02:45:29.485]  Now it's about 200 times, okay?
[02:45:30.706 --> 02:45:31.807]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:45:31.807 --> 02:45:33.188]  You go right in the queue.
[02:45:33.188 --> 02:45:34.009]  First come, first served.
[02:45:34.009 --> 02:45:37.913]  But the fact that the orders are so ultra-massive, it's dizzying.
[02:45:37.913 --> 02:45:39.234]  I mean, this is just insane.
[02:45:39.234 --> 02:45:42.016]  We're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe.
[02:45:42.016 --> 02:45:46.601]  And then, if it continues like this, we're looking at having to suspend food sales.
[02:45:46.601 --> 02:45:48.623]  But everybody gets their order in, we'll get your food.
[02:45:48.623 --> 02:45:50.284]  But that's how big this is.
[02:45:50.284 --> 02:45:53.127]  So what you're getting is 100% the straight deal of what's going on.
[02:45:53.127 --> 02:45:54.068]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:45:55.009 --> 02:45:57.611]  Alex Jones here with two big announcements.
[02:45:57.611 --> 02:46:04.596]  Ultra 12 and Vitamin Mineral Fusion are both back in stock after being sold out for months.
[02:46:04.596 --> 02:46:15.484]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids, and other key cofactors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[02:46:15.484 --> 02:46:19.567]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12.
[02:46:19.567 --> 02:46:22.750]  Taken sublingually under the tongue, it is back in stock.
[02:46:22.750 --> 02:46:24.191]  You can get them both individually.
[02:46:24.731 --> 02:46:31.934]  For 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[02:46:31.934 --> 02:46:39.376]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[02:46:39.376 --> 02:46:47.439]  And of course, vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[02:46:47.439 --> 02:46:53.541]  And they're both back in stock, 40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:46:57.159 --> 02:47:16.186]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:16.186 --> 02:47:19.787]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:19.787 --> 02:47:22.648]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:47:29.872 --> 02:47:33.035]  I'm your host, thanks for joining us.
[02:47:33.035 --> 02:47:38.120]  Alright, in closing, Dr. Francis Boyle, we really appreciate you, your author, research.
[02:47:38.120 --> 02:47:40.082]  People should check out the titles of your books.
[02:47:40.082 --> 02:47:41.984]  A lot of amazing things you write about.
[02:47:41.984 --> 02:47:47.309]  Just as a patriot, as a pro-human person, just as a professor, as a guy that wrote the U.S.
[02:47:47.309 --> 02:47:48.890]  Biological Weapons Law that the U.N.
[02:47:48.890 --> 02:47:49.371]  then adopted.
[02:47:52.452 --> 02:47:55.875]  What are your biggest concerns or final points you want to make about where this is going?
[02:47:55.875 --> 02:48:02.521]  Because, you know, Italy is shutting down all sporting events, tourism down by like 87% the number is.
[02:48:02.521 --> 02:48:07.785]  I mean, this is a giant panic if this isn't super deadly over nothing.
[02:48:07.785 --> 02:48:12.069]  So either way you cut it, something big is going on.
[02:48:12.069 --> 02:48:14.551]  I think you're correct.
[02:48:14.551 --> 02:48:17.314]  I think, you know, the fact that the Fed
[02:48:19.249 --> 02:48:25.573]  When Paul, Trump's old man, was asked, well, we might consider further rate cuts at the end of March.
[02:48:25.573 --> 02:48:31.798]  And then two days later, they cut it by half a point.
[02:48:31.798 --> 02:48:34.900]  I think they realize how dangerous this situation is.
[02:48:34.900 --> 02:48:45.268]  As I said, we, in my opinion, we are facing a coronavirus epidemic here in America.
[02:48:45.268 --> 02:48:46.749]  It will spread across the country.
[02:48:47.635 --> 02:48:48.315]  I think so.
[02:49:05.224 --> 02:49:16.754]  Senior citizens, you'll note Seattle just recently publicly said that anyone over 60 should stay home and avoid public gatherings.
[02:49:16.754 --> 02:49:19.516]  I think that is very good public health advice.
[02:49:19.516 --> 02:49:29.544]  Yes, and I'm doing the best I can to keep my wife at home and of course I come into my office until they shut us down.
[02:49:29.544 --> 02:49:31.606]  Yes, and avoid public gatherings for sure.
[02:49:33.036 --> 02:49:35.718]  And then, you know, do the best you can.
[02:49:35.718 --> 02:49:49.145]  But yes, masks, hand-washing, and realize that everyone, you know, everyone who's saying, oh well, the flu is more infectious, that's just a total lie.
[02:49:49.145 --> 02:49:53.147]  It's now been proven this is more... It's like 1.1% versus 2%.
[02:49:53.147 --> 02:49:53.847]  Here's my gut level.
[02:49:55.154 --> 02:49:58.156]  I get the shy comms use it to crack down on Taiwan and their own people.
[02:49:58.156 --> 02:50:04.801]  They would just shut down almost all their factories and all their major cities and lose tens of billions a day just for a power trip.
[02:50:04.801 --> 02:50:06.502]  This is crippling them for decades.
[02:50:06.502 --> 02:50:10.685]  I mean, this must be something really bad, doctor.
[02:50:10.685 --> 02:50:11.786]  Right, Alex.
[02:50:11.786 --> 02:50:19.772]  You really can't believe anything coming out of China between you and me and their statistics or anything like that.
[02:50:19.772 --> 02:50:20.653]  What do you think is happening?
[02:50:21.575 --> 02:50:25.273]  I think we're seeing a severe threat to the
[02:50:26.420 --> 02:50:27.661]  I'm not saying that's happening.
[02:50:27.661 --> 02:50:29.542]  I'm not positing that theory.
[02:50:29.542 --> 02:50:30.822]  People are saying that.
[02:50:30.822 --> 02:50:31.322]  What do you think?
[02:50:56.129 --> 02:51:05.566]  Well, Alex, what I see just from the record is University of North Carolina was doing this Nazi biological warfare work
[02:51:06.571 --> 02:51:13.137]  China bought and paid to get involved in it because they knew what was going on.
[02:51:13.137 --> 02:51:18.963]  And then they brought that Nazi technology back to China.
[02:51:18.963 --> 02:51:27.791]  They weaponized it, obviously for use against Daesh and or Russia, maybe Taiwan, I don't know.
[02:51:27.791 --> 02:51:29.613]  And they shot themselves in the foot.
[02:51:30.214 --> 02:51:32.355]  That's the way I see it now.
[02:51:32.355 --> 02:51:33.775]  It leaked out of there.
[02:51:33.775 --> 02:51:46.820]  Well, that's what a lot of the really smart people in the Pentagon I've talked to, and that's what a lot of people, even Joel Skousen, they all think it leaked out by maybe harvesters getting the gloves or whatever that were supposed to be burned.
[02:51:46.820 --> 02:51:48.241]  Why would you release this?
[02:51:48.241 --> 02:51:50.501]  It doesn't make sense.
[02:51:50.501 --> 02:51:50.721]  Right.
[02:51:50.721 --> 02:51:55.223]  Even from their perspective, it would not make sense what it has done to them.
[02:51:55.223 --> 02:51:57.664]  As I said, I think it's going to shake
[02:51:58.283 --> 02:52:00.044]  Well, that's the way I see it, yes.
[02:52:13.759 --> 02:52:16.961]  And it's far more serious than the flu.
[02:52:16.961 --> 02:52:18.782]  All these people saying, well, the flu is worse.
[02:52:18.782 --> 02:52:20.423]  That's just total propaganda.
[02:52:20.423 --> 02:52:29.387]  That's just a red herring designed to get the American people from focusing in, really, on what's happening here.
[02:52:29.387 --> 02:52:30.868]  Well, exactly.
[02:52:30.868 --> 02:52:33.769]  Usually the media creates a strawman of what Trump has said that isn't true.
[02:52:33.769 --> 02:52:34.690]  And I defend Trump.
[02:52:35.330 --> 02:52:37.231]  Well, he said, it's like the flu, 2%.
[02:52:37.231 --> 02:52:39.833]  Well, the flu is less than 1 to the 1%.
[02:52:39.833 --> 02:52:41.935]  That is an admittedly false statement.
[02:52:41.935 --> 02:52:42.795]  I'm not attacking Trump.
[02:52:42.795 --> 02:52:46.197]  It's just Fauci's obviously telling him this, and it's just not true.
[02:52:46.197 --> 02:52:48.979]  That's correct.
[02:52:48.979 --> 02:52:54.103]  I mean, how many times does 1 to the 1% do the math versus 2%?
[02:52:54.103 --> 02:52:57.345]  I mean, it's 20 times more powerful.
[02:52:57.345 --> 02:53:00.887]  We know that President Trump is a germaphobe.
[02:53:00.887 --> 02:53:02.328]  We know that for sure.
[02:53:02.328 --> 02:53:04.530]  So, I just don't think he's getting
[02:53:05.391 --> 02:53:07.952]  He's getting criminal advice from people like Fox News.
[02:53:07.952 --> 02:53:09.353]  Oh, that's one thing Roger Stone told me.
[02:53:09.353 --> 02:53:16.376]  It's not a secret, but Trump loves white people, black people, everybody, but he had to get over the phobia of shaking hands.
[02:53:16.376 --> 02:53:18.337]  So he is a germaphobe, or he used to be.
[02:53:19.375 --> 02:53:21.156]  I'm not here to defend Trump either.
[02:53:21.156 --> 02:53:31.462]  I'm just trying to objectively look at the situation and say the advice he's getting is more dangerous than useless when it comes to protecting the American people.
[02:53:31.462 --> 02:53:40.067]  And unfortunately, if he continues to rely on the same cast of characters, it's going to redound to his detriment.
[02:53:40.067 --> 02:53:42.328]  No, no, I agree.
[02:53:42.328 --> 02:53:43.269]  And at a gut level.
[02:53:44.349 --> 02:53:47.552]  To me, the way the media is saying it's Trump's fault, we predicted they would do that.
[02:53:47.552 --> 02:53:50.895]  I think this is the biggest threat to Trump's re-election coming up in six months.
[02:53:50.895 --> 02:53:52.656]  What do you think?
[02:53:52.656 --> 02:53:54.118]  Well, let me say this.
[02:53:54.118 --> 02:53:57.401]  This problem long preceded Trump.
[02:53:57.401 --> 02:54:02.025]  So this is the tip of the iceberg, and Trump is coming in on top of it.
[02:54:02.025 --> 02:54:02.345]  Exactly.
[02:54:02.345 --> 02:54:03.246]  Not defending him.
[02:54:03.246 --> 02:54:04.367]  He just inherited this.
[02:54:04.367 --> 02:54:06.589]  But if he does the wrong thing, he will then own it.
[02:54:08.194 --> 02:54:08.934]  That's correct.
[02:54:08.934 --> 02:54:24.059]  Trump is basically left holding the bag here for years of this Nazi biological warfare work, going back to the neocons under Reagan, and continuing today through Obama.
[02:54:24.059 --> 02:54:26.080]  You're perfectly correct on that.
[02:54:26.727 --> 02:54:38.942]  So, and I also, you know, a stockbroker friend of mine sent me a, you know, a Wells Fargo prediction on all this and asked me to take a look at it and give my comments.
[02:54:38.942 --> 02:54:46.831]  And, you know, Wells Fargo, they said out to all their investors, basically saying, well, we're not facing a recession.
[02:54:47.486 --> 02:54:54.351]  I don't see how we can avoid a recession, Alex, under these circumstances, the way things are going.
[02:54:54.351 --> 02:54:57.013]  Right now, it's out of control.
[02:54:57.013 --> 02:55:02.377]  And I don't think the team that President Trump has around him can
[02:55:03.126 --> 02:55:05.929]  Bring this under control between you and me.
[02:55:05.929 --> 02:55:15.940]  I could be wrong, but again, that goes back to my advice that we cannot rely, we American people cannot rely on the federal government to save us.
[02:55:15.940 --> 02:55:16.400]  No, you're right.
[02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:18.463]  They are not going to save us.
[02:55:18.463 --> 02:55:19.504]  They have made this
[02:55:20.184 --> 02:55:23.606]  Uh, almost out of control at this point.
[02:55:23.606 --> 02:55:29.370]  So, we... Well, you're right, and the Dow's down a thousand points despite a massive interest rate cut.
[02:55:29.370 --> 02:55:30.851]  Dr. Boyle, I know you're a very busy man.
[02:55:30.851 --> 02:55:34.693]  I want to thank you and your family and your wife and your students for the time you took out here.
[02:55:34.693 --> 02:55:37.755]  I know you never plug yourself, but you've written a lot of great books.
[02:55:37.755 --> 02:55:39.997]  Where do people find your books?
[02:55:39.997 --> 02:55:44.299]  Uh, you can just hit my name on Amazon.com.
[02:55:44.299 --> 02:55:45.200]  Go right ahead, sure.
[02:55:45.868 --> 02:55:48.429]  So you just look up Dr. Francis A. Boyle and you'll find it.
[02:55:48.429 --> 02:55:49.409]  I've read several of your books.
[02:55:49.409 --> 02:55:50.470]  That's right.
[02:55:50.470 --> 02:55:55.391]  That's my key book there dealing with the U.S.
[02:55:55.391 --> 02:56:01.273]  biological warfare programs going back to Reagan.
[02:56:01.273 --> 02:56:01.893]  Sure.
[02:56:01.893 --> 02:56:05.315]  So again, Trump is left holding the bat.
[02:56:05.315 --> 02:56:07.075]  He better take action.
[02:56:07.075 --> 02:56:10.756]  But unfortunately, that's politics.
[02:56:10.756 --> 02:56:12.417]  If he can't bring this under control,
[02:56:13.386 --> 02:56:15.968]  The American people are going to hold them responsible for it.
[02:56:15.968 --> 02:56:18.010]  That's just the way things work.
[02:56:18.010 --> 02:56:21.073]  Well, a month ago when you said it, it was somewhat speculation.
[02:56:21.073 --> 02:56:21.733]  Now it's happening.
[02:56:21.733 --> 02:56:22.294]  You've been proven right.
[02:56:22.294 --> 02:56:24.615]  Thank you, Dr. Boyle.
[02:56:24.615 --> 02:56:25.276]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:56:25.276 --> 02:56:30.140]  And again, I appreciate always the fair interview you gave me.
[02:56:30.140 --> 02:56:33.923]  Oh yeah, this is the real Alex Jones Show, not the edited clips.
[02:56:33.923 --> 02:56:35.905]  I used to have fun and act crazy on air like once a week.
[02:56:35.905 --> 02:56:38.447]  They just take that out of context, but everybody gets the real show.
[02:56:38.447 --> 02:56:40.288]  Thank you so much, Doctor.
[02:56:40.288 --> 02:56:40.749]  Thanks a lot.
[02:56:41.499 --> 02:56:44.962]  Believe me, I want to act crazy and silly and be really stupid right now, but I'm not going to do it.
[02:56:44.962 --> 02:56:47.624]  Because when I get stressed out, I tend to have fun and act out.
[02:56:47.624 --> 02:56:48.905]  But I barely do that anymore.
[02:56:48.905 --> 02:56:50.387]  You notice there's not satire anymore?
[02:56:50.387 --> 02:56:52.168]  We don't screw around very much.
[02:56:52.168 --> 02:56:57.213]  Because they take it out of context and say, oh look, Jones, you know, he really believes all this stuff.
[02:56:57.213 --> 02:56:58.414]  I'm really concerned about my children.
[02:56:58.414 --> 02:56:59.414]  I know you are.
[02:56:59.414 --> 02:57:06.881]  And when I told you five weeks ago the big institutions are buying up all this horrible food, it's because they were.
[02:57:06.881 --> 02:57:08.763]  We still have it at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:57:10.151 --> 02:57:12.872]  It's five to eight weeks, depending on what you order, because we're not going to lie to you.
[02:57:12.872 --> 02:57:13.892]  Everybody else has sold out.
[02:57:13.892 --> 02:57:14.372]  They're lying.
[02:57:14.372 --> 02:57:15.853]  They don't even have the food.
[02:57:15.853 --> 02:57:17.093]  We have the food.
[02:57:17.093 --> 02:57:18.153]  We have the factories.
[02:57:18.153 --> 02:57:19.714]  We have the top producer.
[02:57:19.714 --> 02:57:22.155]  They are five to eight weeks.
[02:57:22.155 --> 02:57:23.635]  They're really four weeks, OK?
[02:57:23.635 --> 02:57:26.316]  I mean, we're going to tell you, technically, five to eight weeks.
[02:57:26.316 --> 02:57:28.577]  They're like, Jones, just put extra weeks on it.
[02:57:28.577 --> 02:57:30.997]  Because they were worried the food orders would keep going totally crazy.
[02:57:30.997 --> 02:57:32.418]  And they kind of are, but not as much.
[02:57:33.178 --> 02:57:33.679]  Uh, whatever.
[02:57:33.679 --> 02:57:34.600]  InfoWars4.com.
[02:57:34.600 --> 02:57:36.462]  But get your body ready.
[02:57:36.462 --> 02:57:37.683]  Get your immune defenses.
[02:57:37.683 --> 02:57:39.065]  DNA force 40% off.

[02:57:44.090 --> 02:57:52.479]  I spend a lot of time reminding the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air.
[02:57:52.479 --> 02:57:53.961]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[02:57:54.755 --> 02:58:02.117]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern Paul Revere's.
[02:58:02.117 --> 02:58:09.618]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[02:58:09.618 --> 02:58:18.440]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[02:58:18.440 --> 02:58:22.961]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalists.
[02:58:23.888 --> 02:58:24.068]  This
[02:58:48.510 --> 02:58:48.690]  Go Q10

[03:00:05.220 --> 03:00:08.342]  Make no mistake, Alex Jones here back live.
[03:00:08.342 --> 03:00:09.703]  Crazy stuff's going on.
[03:00:09.703 --> 03:00:17.067]  Matt Bracken's taking over in 15 minutes, but right now I am holding over to take your calls.
[03:00:17.067 --> 03:00:21.210]  Sporting my new Britney Spears haircut and all.
[03:00:21.210 --> 03:00:25.032]  Let's go ahead and talk to Chris, then Nathaniel, then Dan, then Michael, then Trish.
[03:00:25.032 --> 03:00:26.733]  And that's it for me.
[03:00:26.733 --> 03:00:27.514]  Let's go ahead.
[03:00:27.514 --> 03:00:28.314]  Chris, thanks for holding.
[03:00:28.314 --> 03:00:29.575]  You're on the air from North Carolina.
[03:00:29.575 --> 03:00:30.456]  South Carolina, go ahead.
[03:00:31.894 --> 03:00:33.577]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[03:00:33.577 --> 03:00:34.378]  Long time listener.
[03:00:34.378 --> 03:00:35.219]  I love your show, dude.
[03:00:35.219 --> 03:00:36.140]  Thank you, brother.
[03:00:36.140 --> 03:00:39.746]  We're out here in upstate South Carolina engaging in the info war.
[03:00:39.746 --> 03:00:43.852]  Well done, Lord Vader.
[03:00:43.852 --> 03:00:45.775]  Well, earlier I heard you entertain the idea
[03:00:46.664 --> 03:00:50.347]  That Costco footage could be a gimmick like with the Cabbage Patch Dolls.
[03:00:50.347 --> 03:00:58.713]  Maybe it isn't real or something, but... Well, that's all because I sent out my crew to a bunch of places that were supposedly out of stuff in Austin, and they weren't.
[03:00:58.713 --> 03:01:00.935]  The crew's like, sir, they're not sold out.
[03:01:00.935 --> 03:01:02.736]  I go, but so put the report out.
[03:01:02.736 --> 03:01:04.717]  Like, we just want to show what's happening.
[03:01:04.717 --> 03:01:05.178]  So what do you think?
[03:01:06.670 --> 03:01:15.737]  Well, I went to Costco last night locally here and usually they've got lots of food items on sale and last night there were far fewer sale signs.
[03:01:15.737 --> 03:01:27.846]  When I got to the back of the store where they keep the cases of bottled water and paper towels and toilet paper and all that, they had the ground level pallets where you can pick those items off the pallet and put them in your cart.
[03:01:27.846 --> 03:01:32.770]  But in the shelves above where they usually store the extra inventory where the pallets are all wrapped up,
[03:01:33.294 --> 03:01:34.815]  It was all empty space.
[03:01:34.815 --> 03:01:38.898]  And one of the employees was back there consolidating pallets of their store-brand toilet paper.
[03:01:38.898 --> 03:01:42.660]  And I walked up and I said, hey man, I've never seen it looking so empty back here.
[03:01:42.660 --> 03:01:44.821]  And he replied, neither have I. Not in 12 years.
[03:01:46.756 --> 03:01:48.757]  Obviously there's pressure on the supply chain.
[03:01:48.757 --> 03:01:50.578]  There's a lot of panic buying going on.
[03:01:50.578 --> 03:01:57.963]  But like a communist country that Bernie Sanders would want, where you don't get multiple types of deodorant or toilet paper, there are too many types of deodorant.
[03:01:57.963 --> 03:01:58.864]  We need lines.
[03:01:58.864 --> 03:02:00.185]  Those are quotes.
[03:02:00.185 --> 03:02:04.468]  A free market system can leverage up or down during crises.
[03:02:04.468 --> 03:02:05.869]  That's why it's so hard to take us down.
[03:02:05.869 --> 03:02:08.931]  But I mean, I do think they've covered up how bad the virus is.
[03:02:08.931 --> 03:02:11.933]  What do you think is going to happen?
[03:02:11.933 --> 03:02:15.756]  Well, I mean, I think the virus is bad, but I think that
[03:02:16.485 --> 03:02:22.250]  You know, people have been saying, hey, you know, Chris, you're buying into the panic and the hype.
[03:02:22.250 --> 03:02:27.195]  But I think that getting ahead of this curve is super vital because
[03:02:27.901 --> 03:02:33.886]  You know, if you're ahead of the curve and you're prepared, then you don't have to panic when everybody else can't find anything.
[03:02:33.886 --> 03:02:34.807]  Well, that's it.
[03:02:34.807 --> 03:02:36.989]  There's a 10% chance this is really bad.
[03:02:36.989 --> 03:02:38.971]  That's why you get prepared.
[03:02:38.971 --> 03:02:40.192]  And then you're prepared.
[03:02:40.192 --> 03:02:41.773]  That's what preparedness is about.
[03:02:41.773 --> 03:02:42.674]  Like you have insurance.
[03:02:42.674 --> 03:02:45.836]  We have a gun, you know, by your bed at night, you know, in the drawer.
[03:02:45.836 --> 03:02:47.638]  You're not thinking somebody's going to break in that night.
[03:02:47.638 --> 03:02:53.303]  It's just there to know that you're secure, ready to defend yourself, because you're not a victim.
[03:02:53.303 --> 03:02:54.124]  But you just said it.
[03:02:54.864 --> 03:02:55.185]  Exactly.
[03:03:11.383 --> 03:03:12.685]  Well, I love your show, man.
[03:03:12.685 --> 03:03:14.207]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:03:14.207 --> 03:03:16.390]  I love the products, and you have a good one, okay?
[03:03:16.390 --> 03:03:17.051]  Godspeed.
[03:03:17.051 --> 03:03:17.631]  You too, Chris.
[03:03:17.631 --> 03:03:18.372]  Thanks for holding.
[03:03:18.372 --> 03:03:23.639]  All right, I don't want to cut Nathaniel short, so Nathaniel, we'll come back in 60 seconds.
[03:03:23.639 --> 03:03:28.145]  We'll go to you, and then Dan, Michael, and Trish for those callers, and then...
[03:03:29.192 --> 03:03:33.334]  We're going to have Matt Bracken take over for three segments the rest of the hour.
[03:03:33.334 --> 03:03:35.335]  Normally you have a guest host fourth hour.
[03:03:35.335 --> 03:03:36.015]  It's always fun.
[03:03:36.015 --> 03:03:36.996]  They're charged up.
[03:03:36.996 --> 03:03:37.896]  They've got the new news.
[03:03:37.896 --> 03:03:39.277]  They're ready to go on.
[03:03:39.277 --> 03:03:41.078]  Sometimes I commandeer a little bit of it.
[03:03:41.078 --> 03:03:48.581]  But then we're going to have Owen Troyer and the War Room all ready for you.
[03:03:48.581 --> 03:03:53.404]  But you know, I'm not only a HairClub International member.
[03:03:53.404 --> 03:03:55.244]  I'm also the owner.
[03:03:55.244 --> 03:03:58.386]  And so look what HairClub International did for me.
[03:03:59.775 --> 03:04:01.696]  You know, all these years I've been wearing a toupee.
[03:04:01.696 --> 03:04:03.736]  I actually never wore a toupee.
[03:04:03.736 --> 03:04:07.397]  But this toupee I'm wearing is the highest quality ever.
[03:04:07.397 --> 03:04:09.237]  It actually feels the best right now.
[03:04:09.237 --> 03:04:13.258]  You're saying, why are you talking about a toupee?
[03:04:13.258 --> 03:04:19.540]  Well, the truth is I've been a beluga whale all my life, but one that was bipedal.
[03:04:19.540 --> 03:04:27.082]  And so now I'm embracing my trans zoological nature that I am indeed a reentrant aquatic
[03:04:28.660 --> 03:04:31.683]  Having some fun today.
[03:04:31.683 --> 03:04:32.603]  It's Thursday, Thursday.
[03:04:52.515 --> 03:05:00.698]  It's wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness, and that we're seeing record food sales, not just here, but across the world.
[03:05:00.698 --> 03:05:01.278]  That's good.
[03:05:01.278 --> 03:05:03.658]  People need to be self-sufficient.
[03:05:03.658 --> 03:05:10.641]  The average person is living hand-to-mouth, paycheck-to-paycheck, and doesn't even know how to change their tire.
[03:05:10.641 --> 03:05:14.302]  We need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared.
[03:05:14.302 --> 03:05:21.284]  And that means even with just the basics, even a three-week food supply that you know is always there, that you only go to in emergencies.
[03:05:21.884 --> 03:05:27.108]  That said, boosting your immune system is just as critical, or even more so.
[03:05:27.108 --> 03:05:35.373]  And things like DNA Force Plus, that's now back in stock, is so good for your cells, your mitochondria, your telomeres, the engine of your body.
[03:05:35.373 --> 03:05:44.799]  It's back in stock, 40% off right now, along with Ultra 12, and along with Vitamin Mineral Fusion, and a bunch of other great products that are finally back in stock.

[03:05:53.666 --> 03:05:55.007]  Empire's on the run.
[03:05:55.007 --> 03:06:01.332]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[03:06:01.332 --> 03:06:02.092]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:17.463 --> 03:06:19.524]  Nathaniel in North Carolina.
[03:06:19.524 --> 03:06:26.108]  I agree with you the coronavirus could be the new 9-11.
[03:06:26.108 --> 03:06:27.749]  What do you think?
[03:06:27.749 --> 03:06:32.112]  Well God bless you Alex and it's great to chat with you.
[03:06:32.112 --> 03:06:41.558]  You know you've often said that your gut you know points you in the right direction and and typically it knows best and I just want to share what's in my gut.
[03:06:42.327 --> 03:06:52.609]  And this kind of feels to me like a global, slow-motion 9-11 event across multiple nations, obviously.
[03:06:52.609 --> 03:07:05.232]  But it seems that when really wicked things happen, that it involves a perfect storm where multiple large agendas are served by the large power blocks.
[03:07:05.232 --> 03:07:05.692]  That's right.
[03:07:05.692 --> 03:07:06.732]  The planets have to align.
[03:07:06.732 --> 03:07:09.353]  All the globalist bodies have to agree upon it.
[03:07:10.732 --> 03:07:18.063]  You know, you look back at just recent history, you know, when JFK got his head blown off, multiple agendas were served.
[03:07:18.063 --> 03:07:23.250]  When 9-11 happened in 2001, multiple agendas were served.
[03:07:23.250 --> 03:07:25.934]  And this has that feeling of it, and it stinks.
[03:07:27.316 --> 03:07:29.618]  So that's what my gut is telling me right now.
[03:07:29.618 --> 03:07:33.822]  There's a lot we don't know, but there's a lot we know about what's going on right now.
[03:07:33.822 --> 03:07:45.792]  And the key is that it is a man-made bioweapon, they've confirmed it, and that it reinfects with different aspects, like a Swiss Army knife, or like HIV, which it has the same delivery device, it keeps coming back.
[03:07:45.792 --> 03:07:47.273]  That's what's so deadly.
[03:07:47.273 --> 03:07:51.216]  Who knows what it does in phase 3, phase 4, phase 5?
[03:07:51.216 --> 03:07:52.097]  Precisely.
[03:07:52.097 --> 03:07:54.459]  And you know, whether it was, you know, leaked,
[03:07:55.353 --> 03:08:00.580]  Or whether it escaped.
[03:08:00.580 --> 03:08:03.184]  Ultimately, hopefully, we'll understand that.
[03:08:03.184 --> 03:08:03.825]  We'll know that.
[03:08:03.825 --> 03:08:07.931]  But it's almost irrelevant because at this point, it will be utilized.
[03:08:09.808 --> 03:08:13.390]  A good job of just going down the punch list of agenda.
[03:08:13.390 --> 03:08:13.951]  No, you're right.
[03:08:13.951 --> 03:08:17.413]  But you go back six weeks ago, before this was even news, I had this idea.
[03:08:17.413 --> 03:08:22.656]  I said, a man in an astronaut's outfit, I saw the images and said, yes, the Earth uninhabitable for humans.
[03:08:22.656 --> 03:08:24.137]  And I said, this is the future.
[03:08:24.137 --> 03:08:26.859]  And weeks later, that was what was... But it wasn't weeks later.
[03:08:26.859 --> 03:08:30.201]  It was already going on.
[03:08:30.201 --> 03:08:30.801]  It's your gut.
[03:08:30.801 --> 03:08:32.222]  It's the basic instinct.
[03:08:32.222 --> 03:08:36.845]  And, you know, a lot of folks are starting to get that awareness.
[03:08:37.538 --> 03:08:39.119]  And, you know, I'll just make the analogy.
[03:08:39.119 --> 03:08:45.662]  It's kind of crude, but it almost feels like the first tower just got hit and the fireball is still up in the air.
[03:08:45.662 --> 03:08:46.603]  Exactly.
[03:08:46.603 --> 03:08:50.304]  And we're all just tuning in now to see the second tower.
[03:08:50.304 --> 03:08:53.166]  And then we're going to watch them collapse in the other towers.
[03:08:53.166 --> 03:08:56.007]  And then the response that comes after.
[03:08:56.007 --> 03:09:02.130]  And it's going to play out over months and potentially over the next one to two years or even more.
[03:09:02.130 --> 03:09:07.053]  But agendas, this has the potential to serve a lot of wicked agendas and
[03:09:07.699 --> 03:09:11.460]  You just can't discount some of the things that are happening right now.
[03:09:11.460 --> 03:09:16.601]  Zero Hedge has linked to an article by a fellow named Professor Anthony Hall.
[03:09:16.601 --> 03:09:17.921]  I don't know his politics.
[03:09:17.921 --> 03:09:19.362]  I'll have Professor Anthony Hall on.
[03:09:19.362 --> 03:09:20.382]  I think he might be on tomorrow.
[03:09:20.382 --> 03:09:22.002]  Yeah, we really want him on.
[03:09:22.002 --> 03:09:23.262]  I scanned the article.
[03:09:23.262 --> 03:09:25.503]  I didn't do a deep dive on it.
[03:09:25.503 --> 03:09:30.724]  But, you know, he raises a lot of interesting questions and has some powerful info in there.
[03:09:31.463 --> 03:09:36.366]  I don't know much about his background, but we need to be asking the tough questions.
[03:09:36.366 --> 03:09:42.050]  We can't be cowed, and we have to be brave, and we have to be resilient.
[03:09:42.050 --> 03:09:48.675]  You know, you've often said, and many folks have said at its core, we're involved in a spiritual battle right now.
[03:09:48.675 --> 03:09:59.302]  And we need to pray to Almighty God in the name of Jesus Christ, not only for His shield of protection, but that God might bring His mighty sword of justice into this world.
[03:10:00.035 --> 03:10:11.842]  And to bind up and cast out into the fiery pit of abject failure all those wicked, sick, degenerate, evil entities that are looking to bring death, doom, destruction, and despair to humanity.
[03:10:11.842 --> 03:10:18.126]  The United States of America is the beacon of free humanity, and that's what this country is all about.
[03:10:18.126 --> 03:10:20.688]  That's right, and make no mistake, this is the globalist attack.
[03:10:20.688 --> 03:10:21.608]  Nathan, amazing.
[03:10:21.608 --> 03:10:22.889]  God bless you.
[03:10:22.889 --> 03:10:25.331]  Wow, that's four minutes exactly he was on.
[03:10:25.331 --> 03:10:28.933]  We're going to put that in there as a four-minute piece running during the
[03:10:31.152 --> 03:10:31.292]  Hello?
[03:10:31.292 --> 03:10:31.552]  Hi, Alex.
[03:10:31.552 --> 03:10:33.593]  I want to piggyback off the last fellow's point.
[03:10:33.593 --> 03:10:35.193]  Dr. Boyle did us a great service.
[03:10:35.193 --> 03:10:37.554]  He said that you can't trust anything that comes out of the WHO.
[03:10:37.554 --> 03:10:38.934]  Did you hear about the pandemic bonds?
[03:11:04.431 --> 03:11:14.236]  The pandemic bonds are bonds that were set aside for paying money out in case there's a pandemic.
[03:11:14.236 --> 03:11:18.617]  Well, I know after 9-11 they set up some different funds that are for emergencies.
[03:11:18.617 --> 03:11:20.138]  Those are way up.
[03:11:20.138 --> 03:11:28.682]  Well, the one that I'm talking about is going to be paid off like in April, and if they don't call a pandemic before then, then they get the money.
[03:11:29.713 --> 03:11:37.018]  I mean, why aren't we calling for a Taiwan Freedom March-sized occupation of the WHO?
[03:11:37.018 --> 03:11:37.999]  Now, that's confirmed.
[03:11:37.999 --> 03:11:38.539]  You're right.
[03:11:38.539 --> 03:11:42.282]  Even Wall Street created special bond funds for this.
[03:11:42.282 --> 03:11:43.522]  That's a good point, Dan.
[03:11:43.522 --> 03:11:45.784]  Tell folks more about that.
[03:11:45.784 --> 03:11:47.225]  I'd love to.
[03:11:47.225 --> 03:11:48.886]  It's totally unethical.
[03:11:48.886 --> 03:11:58.953]  It's so unethical that if you take where the WHO is positioned in the federal government, the total line of thinking is that you've got to stop
[03:11:59.625 --> 03:12:00.386]  Where are they?
[03:12:00.386 --> 03:12:02.247]  You gotta cut the head off the snake.
[03:12:02.247 --> 03:12:11.134]  You gotta... Why can't we occupy the OO to the point where mainstream media can't stop broadcasting it on television?
[03:12:11.134 --> 03:12:15.437]  Why can't we have a Million Man March or a Two Million Man March on the WHO?
[03:12:17.211 --> 03:12:18.252]  Great point, Dan.
[03:12:18.252 --> 03:12:25.534]  It's time to start exposing the power structure and who's behind all these biological weapons and the quote, treatment of them that's really the way to develop them.
[03:12:25.534 --> 03:12:30.396]  And that's why we had Dr. Francis Boyle on earlier saying he believes these agencies are committing criminal malfeasance.
[03:12:30.396 --> 03:12:31.317]  Thank you, Dan.
[03:12:31.317 --> 03:12:34.078]  Michael in Michigan, thanks for holding your own here.
[03:12:34.078 --> 03:12:36.079]  Hi, thank you.
[03:12:36.079 --> 03:12:42.601]  I'm a fairly new listener, so I'm just kind of playing catch-up, but I appreciate your interview with Dr. Boyle.
[03:12:42.601 --> 03:12:43.762]  I hope you'll have him on again.
[03:12:44.474 --> 03:12:47.656]  And also Mike Adams, I heard him the other day and he was fantastic.
[03:12:47.656 --> 03:12:49.057]  They're both amazing.
[03:12:49.057 --> 03:12:50.698]  They're good people.
[03:12:50.698 --> 03:12:51.698]  Absolutely.
[03:12:51.698 --> 03:12:53.679]  Please continue to have them on.
[03:12:53.679 --> 03:12:54.320]  I will.
[03:12:54.320 --> 03:12:57.962]  Here's the question I would have hoped to have asked Dr. Boyle.
[03:12:57.962 --> 03:13:03.605]  Perhaps you want to take a stab at the answer yourself or maybe you could ask him the next time and he can get back to us.
[03:13:03.605 --> 03:13:08.008]  So my question is, does Dr. Boyle see any scenario where this
[03:13:08.638 --> 03:13:13.659]  We still could be controlled if we had leadership that would do what Dr. Boyle suggests.
[03:13:13.659 --> 03:13:15.140]  That's the first part of my question.
[03:13:15.140 --> 03:13:24.142]  Second part, is this, does he believe this is the kind of infection or virus where people who so-called recover from it?
[03:13:24.142 --> 03:13:28.023]  Because like you said, we don't know what happens in stage five, for example.
[03:13:28.023 --> 03:13:37.266]  Is this something where once people, like, let's assume we could all hide out for six months, nine months, a year, whatever, and let it, you know, do its thing.
[03:13:37.918 --> 03:13:42.582]  But then people who were affected, are they going to still be contagious even though they are so-called recovered?
[03:13:42.582 --> 03:13:45.024]  Are they going to be contagious for the rest of their lives?
[03:13:45.024 --> 03:13:46.826]  This is like HIV.
[03:13:46.826 --> 03:13:49.628]  I can answer your question on that.
[03:13:49.628 --> 03:13:53.391]  Taking action and admitting what's happening is always the best way, and Will would say that.
[03:13:53.391 --> 03:13:55.233]  He actually talked about that a few days ago.
[03:13:55.233 --> 03:13:56.574]  He's been on like once a week last month.
[03:13:56.574 --> 03:13:58.656]  He's been on for, I'm sure, 20 years.
[03:13:58.656 --> 03:14:00.037]  But to answer your second question,
[03:14:03.234 --> 03:14:04.116]  What was your second question?
[03:14:04.116 --> 03:14:05.959]  I had the answer.
[03:14:05.959 --> 03:14:12.291]  I'm trying to, I'm trying to, I'm thinking about, okay, there's not a whole lot we can do at this point other than try to protect ourselves.
[03:14:12.291 --> 03:14:14.174]  I had the answer, then I forgot what you said.
[03:14:14.174 --> 03:14:14.515]  What was it?
[03:14:15.819 --> 03:14:22.242]  So, okay, does Dr. Boyle think that this will be eternally contagious?
[03:14:22.242 --> 03:14:23.903]  Okay, so not what he thinks.
[03:14:23.903 --> 03:14:27.745]  We know it's like HIV, it reinfects.
[03:14:27.745 --> 03:14:33.088]  It's an autoimmune thing, it's got HIV delivery systems, and a bunch of other viruses built in, so it's really bad.
[03:14:33.088 --> 03:14:35.509]  And yes, that's the problem, is it comes back.
[03:14:35.509 --> 03:14:40.951]  That's why people are so scared, is you don't just get it and maybe 2% die, is that it comes back and back.
[03:14:40.951 --> 03:14:41.972]  Thank you, great point, Michael.
[03:14:42.432 --> 03:14:43.932]  That's why people are so scared, folks.
[03:14:43.932 --> 03:14:44.753]  It's man-made.
[03:14:44.753 --> 03:14:46.313]  It's super creepy.
[03:14:46.313 --> 03:14:47.033]  And the U.S.
[03:14:47.033 --> 03:14:48.353]  made it, and China got it.
[03:14:48.353 --> 03:14:52.734]  So there's this weird Trump trying to be friends with China, because no one knows, really, who did it.
[03:14:52.734 --> 03:14:56.235]  And that's why this is so creepy, because it's like a science fiction movie.
[03:14:56.235 --> 03:14:57.255]  Trish, you got 50 seconds.
[03:14:57.255 --> 03:14:57.895]  Sorry, I went to you late.
[03:14:57.895 --> 03:14:59.315]  Go ahead, Trish.
[03:14:59.315 --> 03:15:01.376]  Hey, how are you doing, Alex?
[03:15:01.376 --> 03:15:01.896]  I'm all right.
[03:15:01.896 --> 03:15:05.457]  Yeah, I had a question.
[03:15:05.457 --> 03:15:11.398]  My concern is, if they do develop a vaccine for this coronavirus,
[03:15:12.150 --> 03:15:18.953]  What if that's a way for them to get us some kind of chip, like a Mark of the Beast?
[03:15:18.953 --> 03:15:20.094]  Oh, absolutely.
[03:15:20.094 --> 03:15:22.134]  It's all just more vaccine stuff.
[03:15:22.134 --> 03:15:25.356]  I totally agree.
[03:15:25.356 --> 03:15:30.278]  And that's why if they come up with one, I will not take it.
[03:15:30.278 --> 03:15:31.579]  I swear I won't.
[03:15:31.579 --> 03:15:34.040]  Well, because what they always come up with never protects you anyways.
[03:15:34.040 --> 03:15:34.520]  All right.
[03:15:34.520 --> 03:15:35.801]  I'm sorry we're out of time, Trish.
[03:15:35.801 --> 03:15:36.501]  Thank you so much.
[03:15:39.212 --> 03:15:40.114]  He's about to take over.
[03:15:40.114 --> 03:15:43.679]  Former Navy SEAL bestselling author Matt Bracken is really an informative guy.
[03:15:43.679 --> 03:15:48.367]  And The War Room is in 45 minutes with Owen Schroer, Savannah Hernandez and others.
[03:15:48.367 --> 03:15:49.729]  Whatever you do, spread the live links.
[03:15:49.729 --> 03:15:50.010]  Thank you.
[03:15:51.300 --> 03:15:57.044]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.

[03:16:02.147 --> 03:16:09.873]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[03:16:09.873 --> 03:16:17.738]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[03:16:17.898 --> 03:16:19.699]  Not a security IPO or note.
[03:16:19.699 --> 03:16:29.224]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[03:16:49.414 --> 03:16:49.934]  We're good to go.
[03:16:49.934 --> 03:16:50.354]  We're good to go.
[03:16:50.354 --> 03:16:51.174]  We're good to go.
[03:16:51.174 --> 03:16:51.695]  We're good to go.
[03:16:51.695 --> 03:16:52.415]  We're good to go.
[03:16:52.415 --> 03:16:52.935]  We're good to go.
[03:16:52.935 --> 03:16:53.635]  We're good to go.
[03:16:53.635 --> 03:16:54.175]  We're good to go.
[03:16:54.175 --> 03:16:54.936]  We're good to go.
[03:16:54.936 --> 03:16:55.496]  We're good to go.
[03:16:55.496 --> 03:16:56.176]  We're good to go.
[03:16:56.176 --> 03:16:56.696]  We're good to go.
[03:16:56.696 --> 03:16:57.336]  We're good to go.
[03:16:57.336 --> 03:16:57.777]  We're good to go.
[03:16:57.777 --> 03:16:58.157]  We're good to go.
[03:16:58.157 --> 03:16:58.817]  We're good to go.
[03:16:58.817 --> 03:16:59.797]  We're good to go.
[03:16:59.797 --> 03:17:00.458]  We're good to go.
[03:17:00.458 --> 03:17:01.338]  We're good to go.
[03:17:01.338 --> 03:17:01.878]  We're good to go.
[03:17:01.878 --> 03:17:02.458]  We're good to go.
[03:17:02.458 --> 03:17:03.058]  We're good to go.
[03:17:03.058 --> 03:17:03.599]  We're good to go.
[03:17:03.599 --> 03:17:04.079]  We're good to go.
[03:17:04.079 --> 03:17:04.799]  We're good to go.
[03:17:04.799 --> 03:17:04.939]  We're
[03:17:13.722 --> 03:17:21.967]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:17:21.967 --> 03:17:25.889]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:17:25.889 --> 03:17:27.430]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:17:27.430 --> 03:17:30.391]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:17:30.391 --> 03:17:35.574]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:35.934 --> 03:17:37.135]  I can help you, too.
[03:17:37.135 --> 03:17:40.057]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:17:40.057 --> 03:17:42.278]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:17:42.278 --> 03:17:46.721]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:17:46.721 --> 03:17:52.244]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:17:52.244 --> 03:17:55.506]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world.
[03:17:55.506 --> 03:17:57.887]  A lot of people that never deliver.
[03:17:57.887 --> 03:18:02.110]  Well, I'm here to tell you, InfoWars has delivered in royal flush.
[03:18:03.784 --> 03:18:11.111]  A handful of ace of spades because of God, because of the audience of activists, and because of the great team at M4 Wars.
[03:18:11.111 --> 03:18:14.455]  And we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:18:14.455 --> 03:18:16.236]  So right now, humanity's awakening.
[03:18:16.236 --> 03:18:17.057]  It's explosive.
[03:18:17.057 --> 03:18:17.818]  It's powerful.
[03:18:17.818 --> 03:18:18.358]  It's incredible.
[03:18:19.139 --> 03:18:28.504]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road, and the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game, like MFW is, is the tip of the spear, is your financial support.
[03:18:28.504 --> 03:18:31.345]  We make it really easy at mfwstore.com.
[03:18:31.345 --> 03:18:35.327]  But I am blowing through our backup money right now.
[03:18:37.552 --> 03:18:38.592]  Real stuff, man.
[03:18:38.592 --> 03:18:40.393]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[03:18:40.393 --> 03:18:45.234]  And I love Trump all day long, but, man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[03:19:01.894 --> 03:19:03.394]  I mean, I've got a problem.
[03:19:03.394 --> 03:19:05.115]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[03:19:05.115 --> 03:19:08.896]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[03:19:08.896 --> 03:19:12.757]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[03:19:12.757 --> 03:19:13.977]  20 different stickers.
[03:19:13.977 --> 03:19:15.618]  Impeach the Democrats.
[03:19:15.618 --> 03:19:16.678]  Save the Second Amendment.
[03:19:16.678 --> 03:19:17.778]  Defend the First Amendment.
[03:19:17.778 --> 03:19:19.099]  Infowars.com.
[03:19:19.099 --> 03:19:21.279]  And it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[03:19:21.279 --> 03:19:26.021]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[03:19:26.021 --> 03:19:27.621]  People say, why are you doing this?
[03:19:27.621 --> 03:19:28.161]  What's happening?
[03:19:28.161 --> 03:19:29.622]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[03:19:30.282 --> 03:19:31.763]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[03:19:31.763 --> 03:19:35.106]  And Dr. Puccini, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not watched this yet.
[03:19:35.106 --> 03:19:36.087]  It's brilliant.
[03:19:36.087 --> 03:19:43.173]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that's silence, and made it into a weapon.
[03:19:43.173 --> 03:19:46.115]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[03:19:46.115 --> 03:19:48.938]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[03:19:48.938 --> 03:19:55.263]  Silence.
[03:19:55.263 --> 03:19:57.925]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:14.569 --> 03:20:16.930]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:20:16.930 --> 03:20:21.253]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:20:21.253 --> 03:20:23.794]  Alright.
[03:20:23.794 --> 03:20:26.935]  Well, I'll tell you what.
[03:20:26.935 --> 03:20:29.497]  A couple calls ago, there was a caller.
[03:20:29.497 --> 03:20:34.599]  I mean, this is what a quality show to have callers like, um, I think his name was Adam.
[03:20:34.599 --> 03:20:39.342]  But, uh, he made some, he made some just really unbelievable points.
[03:20:39.342 --> 03:20:43.384]  And, um, and I hope that, uh, people take it to heart.
[03:20:44.167 --> 03:20:46.009]  Dr. Boyle, he was spot on.
[03:20:46.009 --> 03:20:47.990]  You know, I don't know the origins of this thing.
[03:20:47.990 --> 03:20:54.036]  I'm not a microbiologist, but it's absolutely a biological world war we're in right now.
[03:20:54.036 --> 03:21:00.401]  And you can say it's the Chinese fault or the American government earlier, or maybe it's just bat soup.
[03:21:00.401 --> 03:21:02.043]  Who the hell knows, really?
[03:21:02.043 --> 03:21:05.426]  But, I mean, because we're all going to be getting information from everywhere.
[03:21:06.181 --> 03:21:14.583]  But this is a biological world war, and it's the coronavirus versus humanity at this point.
[03:21:14.583 --> 03:21:15.643]  It's out.
[03:21:15.643 --> 03:21:33.406]  I think last week I mentioned Dr. Strangelove, where a crazy American general in the famous movie from the early 60s launches a B-52 strike because he's convinced he's got to start off Armageddon for the good of the West, and that other generals will have to follow.
[03:21:34.351 --> 03:21:38.995]  And that's, you know, in a sense, this is what China is now looking at.
[03:21:38.995 --> 03:21:42.618]  There's no other country on the planet that could lose 500 million people
[03:21:44.398 --> 03:21:48.241]  And still have a billion left over to repopulate the world.
[03:21:48.241 --> 03:21:51.443]  And if you don't think that they're thinking this way, they are.
[03:21:51.443 --> 03:21:55.466]  There's not anything you can trust out of the Chinese Communist Party.
[03:21:55.466 --> 03:21:56.746]  The figures are lies.
[03:21:56.746 --> 03:22:01.349]  People from inside that are getting the word out are saying that hospitals have quotas.
[03:22:01.349 --> 03:22:04.872]  It's all coming top down from the Chinese Communist Party.
[03:22:04.872 --> 03:22:11.856]  Your hospital may not say it has X. It can only say it has one quarter X. And we're getting it under control.
[03:22:11.856 --> 03:22:12.417]  This is
[03:22:13.240 --> 03:22:15.502]  Pure communist propaganda.
[03:22:15.502 --> 03:22:23.229]  What's really happening is what's happening in places like Iran, where it's rampant.
[03:22:23.229 --> 03:22:27.872]  If you can roll that tape, I want to talk while it rolls.
[03:22:27.872 --> 03:22:33.117]  This is what it really looks like when coronavirus gets loose in an ordinary city.
[03:22:33.598 --> 03:22:39.241]  Now China has the advantage that they can force people to quarantine or else.
[03:22:39.241 --> 03:22:45.204]  You either quarantine or we'll put you in a quarantine camp and you'll never be seen again.
[03:22:45.204 --> 03:22:50.026]  But in Iran, they're at the mass grave level.
[03:22:50.026 --> 03:23:02.032]  Back earlier in that video, they show a morgue, not even a morgue, I think it's the basement of a hospital, where there's just dozens of body bags.
[03:23:02.532 --> 03:23:06.714]  And they're at the level now of bulldozing mass grave pits in Iran.
[03:23:06.714 --> 03:23:08.855]  This is the real story.
[03:23:08.855 --> 03:23:10.976]  It's not getting out to the U.S.
[03:23:10.976 --> 03:23:11.717]  media.
[03:23:11.717 --> 03:23:14.898]  We are still in a pure cover-up mood.
[03:23:14.898 --> 03:23:20.061]  We're still in what I call the Jaws, Amity Island, you know, happy talk.
[03:23:20.061 --> 03:23:22.042]  Don't wreck the stock market.
[03:23:22.042 --> 03:23:23.963]  Don't cause people to panic.
[03:23:23.963 --> 03:23:25.944]  You know, there's no shark threat.
[03:23:26.565 --> 03:23:27.106]  Okay.
[03:23:27.106 --> 03:23:30.849]  What's important is that the Fourth of July Festival doesn't get ruined.
[03:23:30.849 --> 03:23:32.331]  That's the stock market.
[03:23:32.331 --> 03:23:34.633]  We don't want to wreck the airline industry.
[03:23:34.633 --> 03:23:36.215]  Well, folks, I'm sorry.
[03:23:36.215 --> 03:23:38.077]  That's all done.
[03:23:38.077 --> 03:23:40.599]  Our government is always behind the curve.
[03:23:40.599 --> 03:23:44.543]  Not only our government, but we're further behind the curve than most.
[03:23:44.543 --> 03:23:46.105]  I saw the Surgeon General today.
[03:23:47.031 --> 03:23:48.972]  He is still calling it.
[03:23:48.972 --> 03:23:51.213]  He's still saying that the flu is worse.
[03:23:51.213 --> 03:23:53.654]  He looks like he's right out of college.
[03:23:53.654 --> 03:23:56.495]  So he's probably a kind of a token kind of a guy.
[03:23:56.495 --> 03:23:58.856]  When you see him, you'll know what I'm talking about.
[03:23:58.856 --> 03:24:01.037]  He's just doing the party line.
[03:24:01.037 --> 03:24:01.798]  No problem.
[03:24:01.798 --> 03:24:02.858]  You don't need masks.
[03:24:02.858 --> 03:24:05.639]  If you're ordinary people, please don't buy masks.
[03:24:05.639 --> 03:24:07.120]  They'll only hurt you.
[03:24:07.120 --> 03:24:11.882]  But we need to save them for the medical personnel because they critically need them.
[03:24:12.620 --> 03:24:14.281]  Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.
[03:24:14.281 --> 03:24:15.482]  Which one is it?
[03:24:15.482 --> 03:24:20.364]  This is almost like Baghdad Bob level of bad messaging.
[03:24:20.364 --> 03:24:24.547]  And this can easily be Trump's Super Katrina.
[03:24:24.547 --> 03:24:31.290]  I even saw him a few days ago saying, I saw Trump a few days ago saying, it's just going to disappear like a miracle.
[03:24:31.290 --> 03:24:37.134]  Well, when you say stuff like this, if it turns out that it's a pandemic and it has awful casualties in the USA,
[03:24:38.268 --> 03:24:44.733]  They are going to play these clips of Trump non-stop leading up to the election.
[03:24:44.733 --> 03:24:51.818]  And we're going to have the money of Bloomberg behind the messaging of Joe Biden.
[03:24:51.818 --> 03:24:55.360]  And never mind that he's a senile old fool.
[03:24:55.360 --> 03:25:00.164]  He'll look like, you know, when they package him in all these ads, he's going to look great.
[03:25:00.164 --> 03:25:07.189]  And Trump's going to look terrible because they're going to be playing all these Trump clips saying, oh, the flu kills more people.
[03:25:07.629 --> 03:25:20.311]  You know, people that still say that the flu kills more people, they do not understand a geometric progression compared to a linear progression.
[03:25:20.311 --> 03:25:25.172]  They're like people who have never seen or heard of a tsunami.
[03:25:25.172 --> 03:25:35.474]  And you're trying to explain to them about the water rising and falling, and their only basis for comparison is a daily, like, two or three foot tide where they live.
[03:25:36.094 --> 03:25:38.735]  And you're trying to tell them, no, it's not like that.
[03:25:38.735 --> 03:25:40.095]  It's way worse.
[03:25:40.095 --> 03:25:42.216]  And they're saying, oh, come on.
[03:25:42.216 --> 03:25:43.536]  The tide, it's nothing.
[03:25:43.536 --> 03:25:44.336]  It's the flu.
[03:25:44.336 --> 03:25:46.177]  18,000 a year.
[03:25:46.177 --> 03:25:51.898]  But that 18 or 40, whatever it is per year, is steady like the daily tide.
[03:25:51.898 --> 03:25:55.079]  What's coming is a geometric progression.
[03:25:55.760 --> 03:26:03.004]  And those films from Iran, that's what it's going to be like in the USA because we're not even like Korea.
[03:26:03.004 --> 03:26:11.848]  In Korea, people will line up for miles or in an orderly fashion to buy masks, okay?
[03:26:11.848 --> 03:26:14.829]  And then probably like one or two per customer.
[03:26:14.829 --> 03:26:17.991]  They're not going to do that in America.
[03:26:17.991 --> 03:26:21.853]  In America, when this panic really hits,
[03:26:22.540 --> 03:26:25.642]  People are not going to line up for anything.
[03:26:25.642 --> 03:26:30.084]  They're going to storm the local supermarket and loot it for food.
[03:26:30.084 --> 03:26:34.886]  They're going to loot it for drinking water, the pharmacy, the gun store.
[03:26:34.886 --> 03:26:37.888]  You know, everything is going to be looted like that.
[03:26:37.888 --> 03:26:41.590]  And once things are looted, you can't just resupply.
[03:26:41.590 --> 03:26:50.855]  So as bad as the disease is going to be, our American social chaos reaction is probably going to be worse because
[03:26:52.150 --> 03:27:00.714]  The WHO, which we'll get to that in the next segment, the WHO's own numbers now are something like 3.5% fatality rate of people who are infected.
[03:27:00.714 --> 03:27:02.895]  Harvard said 40-70% of Americans will be infected.
[03:27:02.895 --> 03:27:02.935]  40-70%.
[03:27:02.935 --> 03:27:04.936]  3.5% of that is still millions dead.
[03:27:04.936 --> 03:27:06.516]  The Spanish flu killed 2.5 million people.
[03:27:20.382 --> 03:27:29.655]  But our society at the end of World War I was very rigid, traditional, had a high trust, was a high trust society.
[03:27:29.655 --> 03:27:37.226]  You know, if the government said everybody needs to stay inside or not go to ballgames, people did it.
[03:27:37.853 --> 03:27:39.214]  That trust is gone.
[03:27:39.214 --> 03:27:47.281]  A genius doctor, an Einstein of doctors, could invent the perfect vaccine if it was completely safe.
[03:27:47.281 --> 03:27:48.602]  The magic bullet.
[03:27:48.602 --> 03:27:52.765]  It still wouldn't work because in our low-trust society of 2020,
[03:27:54.261 --> 03:28:00.964]  There are so many Americans that have lost all trust in government that they wouldn't take a perfect vaccine.
[03:28:00.964 --> 03:28:06.366]  And it might be the kind of vaccine where if one-third of the population doesn't take it, it won't matter.
[03:28:06.366 --> 03:28:11.007]  And in any event, a vaccine is a minimum of a year away.
[03:28:11.007 --> 03:28:14.769]  So there will be waves of this pandemic sweeping over the globe.
[03:28:15.309 --> 03:28:16.350]  Mutating?
[03:28:16.350 --> 03:28:18.931]  There's already an S version and an L version.
[03:28:18.931 --> 03:28:30.798]  You know, we have such good genomic data capability now that they can track the mutations and find, like, whether it's Washington state or Italy and Germany,
[03:28:31.491 --> 03:28:32.632]  Who got it?
[03:28:32.632 --> 03:28:34.293]  What strand it is?
[03:28:34.293 --> 03:28:38.196]  All of this is knowable, but what they can't do is stop it.
[03:28:38.196 --> 03:28:47.424]  Because that thing, that little bump, that little probe on the outside of the virus is made to fit your lung receptor like a magic key.
[03:28:47.424 --> 03:28:48.905]  A perfect key.
[03:28:48.905 --> 03:28:51.627]  And we're going to keep going with this when we come back in a couple minutes.
[03:28:51.627 --> 03:28:54.009]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[03:28:54.489 --> 03:28:57.390]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[03:28:57.390 --> 03:29:04.614]  Whether it's a big company selling your data, or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.

[03:29:57.669 --> 03:29:58.249]  Go ahead.
[03:29:58.249 --> 03:30:01.009]  Alex, hey, I just want to say it's great to be back once again.
[03:30:01.009 --> 03:30:04.090]  And I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for your product.
[03:30:04.090 --> 03:30:09.371]  So that Super Blue Fluoride Free Toothpaste and that Super Blue Whitening Toothpaste is on another level.
[03:30:09.371 --> 03:30:14.533]  I use the one I use the Super Blue in the morning and then the whitening at night and it absorbs into your gum.
[03:30:14.533 --> 03:30:17.353]  It is by far the best product that I've ever used in my life.
[03:30:17.353 --> 03:30:19.994]  I literally just took turbo force on my way to the gym right now.
[03:30:20.194 --> 03:30:28.281]  I've had four shoulder surgeries and a back surgery, and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life.
[03:30:28.281 --> 03:30:29.622]  So I just want to get that out of the way.
[03:30:29.622 --> 03:30:30.563]  Support this man.
[03:30:30.563 --> 03:30:32.044]  Everything that he exposed.
[03:30:32.044 --> 03:30:33.465]  Nobody knew about Bohemian Grove.
[03:30:33.465 --> 03:30:34.586]  Nobody knew about Epstein.
[03:30:34.586 --> 03:30:35.887]  Nobody knew about Bilderberg.
[03:30:35.887 --> 03:30:38.730]  Nobody called 9-11 before it happened in July 2001.
[03:30:38.730 --> 03:30:40.411]  Go look it up yourself.
[03:30:40.411 --> 03:30:41.552]  Well, we try our best, sir.
[03:30:41.552 --> 03:30:42.773]  They definitely want us off the air.
[03:30:42.773 --> 03:30:43.654]  Without you, we're not here.
[03:30:43.654 --> 03:30:45.575]  But yeah, these are all great products, so thank you, sir.
[03:30:53.380 --> 03:30:58.602]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[03:30:58.602 --> 03:31:02.884]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[03:31:02.884 --> 03:31:07.325]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[03:31:07.325 --> 03:31:15.728]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breathe air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.

[03:31:23.371 --> 03:31:26.992]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars.

[03:31:51.820 --> 03:31:52.520]  The best product.
[03:31:52.520 --> 03:31:57.082]  I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[03:31:57.082 --> 03:31:59.804]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[03:31:59.804 --> 03:32:01.525]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[03:32:01.525 --> 03:32:03.185]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[03:32:03.185 --> 03:32:04.126]  That was a crazy week.
[03:32:04.126 --> 03:32:15.811]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the InfoWars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[03:32:15.811 --> 03:32:17.132]  Nobody wakes up in the morning
[03:32:18.618 --> 03:32:20.999]  And thinks, I'm gonna give that person over there a better life.
[03:32:20.999 --> 03:32:22.400]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what?
[03:32:22.400 --> 03:32:26.642]  I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[03:32:26.642 --> 03:32:28.883]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[03:32:28.883 --> 03:32:30.384]  I don't think that happens very often.
[03:32:30.384 --> 03:32:31.185]  It's never happened to me.
[03:32:31.185 --> 03:32:34.106]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[03:32:34.106 --> 03:32:35.807]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[03:32:35.947 --> 03:32:38.710]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[03:32:38.710 --> 03:32:46.697]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com and take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[03:32:46.697 --> 03:32:50.001]  Don't buy into the groupthink, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the TurboForce.
[03:32:50.001 --> 03:32:54.705]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[03:32:54.705 --> 03:32:57.348]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:12.455 --> 03:33:19.296]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:19.296 --> 03:33:26.358]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:33:26.358 --> 03:33:27.598]  All right.
[03:33:27.598 --> 03:33:30.798]  Coronavirus is going to take all the time that I've got.
[03:33:30.798 --> 03:33:39.220]  And I hope people do take it seriously because people who I have respected in the past, some national talk show hosts and so forth,
[03:33:40.677 --> 03:33:44.858]  They're still going with the flu comparison.
[03:33:44.858 --> 03:33:53.061]  You know, they're still, they're still, you know, the Amity Island Chamber of Commerce don't wreck the Fourth of July Festival.
[03:33:53.061 --> 03:33:55.002]  Sharks are, sharks are just hyped.
[03:33:55.002 --> 03:33:56.182]  There's no shark threat.
[03:33:56.182 --> 03:33:58.863]  The water is fine.
[03:33:58.863 --> 03:34:07.086]  A couple of, you know, callers back and Alex even said, I'm going to make this guy the, like a caller of the day.
[03:34:07.086 --> 03:34:08.466]  And I agree with that completely.
[03:34:09.540 --> 03:34:10.581]  His name might have been Adam.
[03:34:10.581 --> 03:34:12.102]  I didn't write it down, unfortunately.
[03:34:12.102 --> 03:34:18.808]  He called, he called this pandemic a slow motion 9-11.
[03:34:18.808 --> 03:34:23.092]  You know, we've seen the first tower collapse and we can't believe it.
[03:34:23.092 --> 03:34:28.316]  And we're not even prepared mentally to see the second tower collapse.
[03:34:28.316 --> 03:34:32.960]  But 9-11 only affected Manhattan directly.
[03:34:33.553 --> 03:34:43.175]  Yeah, there was economic spilloff, then we went charging into Afghanistan, which I could understand, at least to get rid of Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan.
[03:34:43.175 --> 03:34:53.318]  Then we went charging into Iraq, which was completely a mistake in my opinion, as bad as Saddam Hussein was, or today, as bad as Assad is in Syria.
[03:34:54.739 --> 03:34:59.482]  It's better than being a bull in a china shop, just smashing everything like the U.S.
[03:34:59.482 --> 03:35:00.343]  military did.
[03:35:00.343 --> 03:35:02.044]  With good intentions, all right?
[03:35:02.044 --> 03:35:06.106]  Of course, the industrial complex, they get their billions out of it.
[03:35:06.106 --> 03:35:13.211]  You know, so what's a couple ten thousand Americans missing limbs, traumatic brain injury?
[03:35:13.211 --> 03:35:19.775]  That's a small price to pay for our global elites to make billions of dollars on war contracts.
[03:35:19.775 --> 03:35:21.476]  Small price to pay.
[03:35:21.476 --> 03:35:21.936]  You know, we'll
[03:35:22.779 --> 03:35:28.604]  We'll have some specials on TV where we say, we love the veterans and salute the troops.
[03:35:28.604 --> 03:35:36.269]  But let's face it, as bad as Saddam Hussein was, in retrospect, what has happened is worse.
[03:35:36.269 --> 03:35:49.800]  Now, not only is Iraq still in turmoil, Syria is in a continuing civil war, flooding Turkey with refugees that Turkey is now sending straight into Europe.
[03:35:49.800 --> 03:35:52.402]  I mean, the chaos and destruction
[03:35:53.397 --> 03:35:58.862]  Since we got rid of Saddam, it has been much worse than putting up with Saddam.
[03:35:58.862 --> 03:36:02.005]  And to his credit, Trump said this all along.
[03:36:02.005 --> 03:36:17.158]  Now, Alex, talking to this caller that called this a slow-motion 9-11, even though this is a global pandemic, he said, it seems like the purpose of this is to make the planet uninhabitable for humans.
[03:36:17.782 --> 03:36:24.964]  You know, this isn't a quick, easy disease where you get over it, and you've got an immunity, and you go about your life.
[03:36:24.964 --> 03:36:32.126]  You know, X percent die, everybody else's health is healthy, and they've got an immunity, like Spanish flu.
[03:36:32.126 --> 03:36:34.887]  It's done, it's over, it's in the past.
[03:36:34.887 --> 03:36:37.128]  This thing keeps mutating.
[03:36:37.128 --> 03:36:39.309]  It has different characteristics.
[03:36:39.309 --> 03:36:44.590]  The video I showed from Iran shows sick children, it shows young people falling down.
[03:36:44.590 --> 03:36:46.131]  This is a real killer.
[03:36:47.301 --> 03:36:54.729]  Chris Martinson at Peak Prosperity, who I watch every day, every video he makes, he's extremely smart about this.
[03:36:54.729 --> 03:36:57.171]  He calls it the honey badger virus.
[03:36:57.171 --> 03:37:08.764]  And it really upsets me that Trump is still surrounded by, you know, lackeys and sycophants and Chamber of Commerce types who are low-balling this.
[03:37:09.600 --> 03:37:13.844]  Oh, you don't need masks because they'll only hurt you if you're an ordinary person.
[03:37:13.844 --> 03:37:18.949]  And we need to save them for the medical personnel because they're critically needed for them.
[03:37:18.949 --> 03:37:19.830]  Sorry.
[03:37:19.830 --> 03:37:22.593]  That's Baghdad Bob PR.
[03:37:22.593 --> 03:37:27.677]  And this is going to be Trump's Katrina if he keeps handling it this way.
[03:37:27.677 --> 03:37:32.242]  Because they're just going to annihilate him by playing back his own words.
[03:37:32.822 --> 03:37:36.684]  And he'll be at left saying, but I didn't know how bad it would be.
[03:37:36.684 --> 03:37:39.825]  Well, lots of people knew how bad it was going to be.
[03:37:39.825 --> 03:37:49.309]  From January on, people with eyes to see that could understand, you know, a geometric progression have understood this.
[03:37:49.309 --> 03:38:00.074]  The author of The Black Swan, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, he's been all over this, that governments just cannot react fast enough.
[03:38:00.074 --> 03:38:00.394]  It's like a
[03:38:02.961 --> 03:38:05.482]  The movie Starship Troopers.
[03:38:05.482 --> 03:38:07.242]  It's humans versus bugs.
[03:38:07.242 --> 03:38:08.442]  Giant bugs.
[03:38:08.442 --> 03:38:11.763]  Well, this is Starship Troopers on our planet.
[03:38:11.763 --> 03:38:14.583]  It's the humans versus the tiny bugs.
[03:38:14.583 --> 03:38:18.024]  And the sideshow is, where did the bug come from?
[03:38:18.024 --> 03:38:20.084]  Or who released the bug?
[03:38:20.084 --> 03:38:23.105]  The fact is, the bug is loose.
[03:38:23.105 --> 03:38:28.686]  And just like in Doctor Strangelove, at the point in the movie where the B-52s are flying,
[03:38:30.822 --> 03:38:35.165]  And our General Buck Tergesen says, look, we can't help that.
[03:38:35.165 --> 03:38:42.690]  You know, that's an unhappy incidence, but we've got to now make the best advantage for America.
[03:38:42.690 --> 03:38:53.517]  I am guaranteeing you that the very evil, way more evil than our American generals and Dr. Strangelove, the Chinese generals are saying, you know, Chairman Lee,
[03:38:56.326 --> 03:39:10.774]  This might not be the worst thing that ever happened because we've done the calculations and we can lose 500 million people and we can still win because the rest of the world will be depopulated.
[03:39:10.774 --> 03:39:16.378]  You know, China has basically bought Africa.
[03:39:16.378 --> 03:39:18.079]  It's a fact.
[03:39:18.079 --> 03:39:22.241]  There are African countries that have sovereignty in name only.
[03:39:22.984 --> 03:39:25.365]  Their leaders have been bought off.
[03:39:25.365 --> 03:39:31.948]  They've got, you know, millions and billions in Swiss bank accounts, and the Chinese own their countries.
[03:39:31.948 --> 03:39:51.376]  These countries, under their corrupt leadership, bribed and bought by the Chinese, these African countries, and not only Africa, also in South America and other places, but primarily in Africa, these countries have signed contracts to pay back loans to China that are impossible to pay.
[03:39:51.963 --> 03:40:03.546]  And it's not like America was perfect in this regard with our banned capitalism, but this is leveraged to put China in control of ownership of these countries.
[03:40:04.346 --> 03:40:09.169]  And when this gets loose in Africa, Africa is going to be depopulated.
[03:40:09.169 --> 03:40:12.591]  I mean, I'm worried about the United States of America.
[03:40:12.591 --> 03:40:28.059]  We have a leadership that is still in denial, either in denial or they're trying to like, you know, on the side quietly, warning their own family, warning their elite network, get ready, hoard food, because this is a killer.
[03:40:28.059 --> 03:40:29.980]  Meanwhile, they go on television.
[03:40:29.980 --> 03:40:31.741]  You don't need a face mask.
[03:40:31.741 --> 03:40:33.002]  Everything's great.
[03:40:33.002 --> 03:40:33.662]  Don't worry.
[03:40:34.062 --> 03:40:42.947]  This is like people on the Titanic saying to the ordinary people down in steerage, don't panic because they want a place in the lifeboat.
[03:40:42.947 --> 03:40:43.707]  Alright?
[03:40:43.707 --> 03:40:54.453]  So, if China ends up the winner of this, it could be a Chinese world in a century.
[03:40:54.453 --> 03:40:59.015]  And I'm not saying that's going to happen, but I am telling you, at the very top level,
[03:40:59.807 --> 03:41:09.415]  Like in the movie Dr. Strangelove, but that was, you know, B-52s going 500 miles an hour in a very short compressed time frame.
[03:41:09.415 --> 03:41:12.698]  This is a slow motion Dr. Strangelove.
[03:41:12.698 --> 03:41:20.765]  The missiles are flying, but the missiles are these coronavirus bugs, these mutating coronavirus bugs.
[03:41:20.765 --> 03:41:22.807]  And how this is going to end up
[03:41:23.334 --> 03:41:26.196]  In five or ten years, nobody knows.
[03:41:26.196 --> 03:41:51.029]  But one thing that I can tell you for sure, if you are still listening to American government and mainstream media, like that Surgeon General buffoon, if you are still listening to them and taking them seriously, all I can say is you are like a poor steerage class person down in the Titanic, that hears the crew say, don't worry, you don't need a life jacket.
[03:41:51.029 --> 03:41:52.410]  This ship is unsinkable.
[03:41:53.067 --> 03:41:58.589]  Meanwhile, the crew is all hoarding life jackets and heading for the lifeboats.
[03:41:58.589 --> 03:42:03.470]  In this case, there aren't enough lifeboat seats for the passengers.
[03:42:03.470 --> 03:42:05.071]  I guarantee you that.
[03:42:05.071 --> 03:42:13.433]  And when we come back on the other half, after the break, I'm going to talk about the medical consequences in the United States.
[03:42:13.433 --> 03:42:18.555]  How this is going to affect medical staff and people who are going to start having to make decisions.
[03:42:19.465 --> 03:42:25.106]  Do I just keep going to work and probably get infected, or do I start self-quarantining now?
[03:42:25.106 --> 03:42:27.187]  My government's never going to tell me that.
[03:42:27.187 --> 03:42:30.847]  They're saying there's no sharks in Amity Island.
[03:42:30.847 --> 03:42:32.008]  When do I start?
[03:42:32.008 --> 03:42:39.069]  Well, I've been out in the big box stores and fast food places, and they're getting empty.
[03:42:39.069 --> 03:42:44.670]  Regardless of what our government tells us, people are starting to do their own self-quarantine.
[03:42:44.670 --> 03:42:47.871]  And when I come back, we're going to keep going with this coronavirus.
[03:42:51.075 --> 03:42:54.916]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.

[03:43:50.163 --> 03:43:50.543]  By you.
[03:44:05.131 --> 03:44:08.536]  Riots in the streets, but everything they do is blowing up in their face.
[03:44:08.536 --> 03:44:17.848]  We the people have to pray, stay focused, be involved, keep spreading the word, keep countering their lies, and we have to be prepared in case things go south.

[03:44:52.033 --> 03:45:00.359]  I also want to say that I'm happy to be helping out with an enterprise that is supported by all the work to help people be prepared.
[03:45:00.359 --> 03:45:07.323]  And instead of just giving into sickness care, take care of their health, take care of their nutrition in a way that contributes to greater vitality.
[03:45:07.323 --> 03:45:09.445]  And I say that from personal experience.
[03:45:09.565 --> 03:45:24.379]  Because I know that the products that are being offered here, I've tried them and I use them every day, and that power pack that they have, the AM-PM power pack, well I wouldn't be so energetic this morning, except that I have been on a regular customer in that regard.
[03:45:25.020 --> 03:45:26.441]  Everybody's calling me, I'm getting
[03:45:53.712 --> 03:46:00.357]  Constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really deadly?
[03:46:00.357 --> 03:46:01.818]  How bad is it really?
[03:46:01.818 --> 03:46:04.500]  So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high quality, storable foods.
[03:46:04.500 --> 03:46:07.562]  We have the only company, the biggest in the nation, that actually still has food.
[03:46:07.562 --> 03:46:10.184]  It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got to package it.
[03:46:10.184 --> 03:46:10.824]  They got the food.
[03:46:10.824 --> 03:46:15.188]  But I want to encourage listeners to do the most important thing, and that's drink purified water.
[03:46:15.188 --> 03:46:15.968]  That's pray.
[03:46:15.968 --> 03:46:16.649]  That's get focused.
[03:46:16.649 --> 03:46:18.650]  That's not be stressed out because you're prepared.
[03:46:18.650 --> 03:46:22.773]  And that's get DNA Force Plus, the PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans out the mitochondria.
[03:46:22.793 --> 03:46:23.353]  We're good to go!
[03:46:55.689 --> 03:46:59.292]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:46:59.292 --> 03:47:08.178]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:47:08.178 --> 03:47:10.499]  It's Matt Bracken.
[03:47:10.499 --> 03:47:14.322]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:29.226 --> 03:47:34.729]  You know, for the last 15 or so years, I've been writing dystopian fiction.
[03:47:34.729 --> 03:47:41.672]  And in my novels, we have a lot of, you know, really difficult problems and bad outcomes.
[03:47:41.672 --> 03:47:44.754]  And I wrote them so that people would pay attention to me when it really mattered.
[03:47:44.754 --> 03:47:45.574]  That's why I wrote them.
[03:47:45.574 --> 03:47:47.535]  That was my motivation.
[03:47:47.535 --> 03:47:50.456]  When it really counts, I'll have some credibility.
[03:47:50.456 --> 03:47:51.637]  All right.
[03:47:51.637 --> 03:47:58.060]  And in my novels, there wasn't something as dangerous as an asymptomatic
[03:47:58.630 --> 03:48:07.895]  Spreader of a virus who could, you know, be a child that won't be affected, that brings it home and infects his parents who die.
[03:48:07.895 --> 03:48:12.297]  I mean, this is something that can get on an airplane.
[03:48:12.297 --> 03:48:17.720]  Nobody's coughing, nobody's sniffling, and half the people on the airplane are infected.
[03:48:17.720 --> 03:48:20.382]  This is like another order of magnitude.
[03:48:20.382 --> 03:48:26.225]  You know, that movie Starship Troopers with the bugs?
[03:48:26.225 --> 03:48:27.826]  At least you could see those bugs.
[03:48:28.587 --> 03:48:31.048]  And they were fighting on other planets.
[03:48:31.048 --> 03:48:35.429]  This is our home planet, and the bug is too small to see.
[03:48:35.429 --> 03:48:41.732]  And not only that, our own generals are saying, there's no bug problem.
[03:48:41.732 --> 03:48:44.793]  The old flu bug is worse than this invisible bug.
[03:48:44.793 --> 03:48:48.314]  It just, it blows my mind.
[03:48:48.314 --> 03:48:49.475]  It really does.
[03:48:49.475 --> 03:48:56.177]  You know, we're still, if you put on the news in this country,
[03:48:57.031 --> 03:48:59.111]  They're still covering the election.
[03:48:59.111 --> 03:49:01.012]  Okay, Bloomberg's out.
[03:49:01.012 --> 03:49:02.612]  Warren is out.
[03:49:02.612 --> 03:49:06.273]  You know, Biden is the man, even though he's got dementia.
[03:49:06.273 --> 03:49:13.974]  As if everything that's happening outside of America isn't going to affect what's happening inside of America.
[03:49:13.974 --> 03:49:20.216]  I don't understand people, how they can be so myopic, how they can channelize their thinking.
[03:49:20.216 --> 03:49:22.596]  Oh, it's terrible what happened in China.
[03:49:22.596 --> 03:49:26.617]  It's terrible what's spreading to like, you know, 70 other countries, half of the world.
[03:49:27.253 --> 03:49:28.793]  That we know of.
[03:49:28.793 --> 03:49:29.934]  It's, you know, it's terrible.
[03:49:29.934 --> 03:49:30.974]  Those Iran things.
[03:49:30.974 --> 03:49:32.454]  Look at those morgues in Iran.
[03:49:32.454 --> 03:49:33.895]  But those are Iranians.
[03:49:33.895 --> 03:49:34.695]  They're dumb.
[03:49:34.695 --> 03:49:37.335]  They believe, you know, they kiss shrines.
[03:49:37.335 --> 03:49:39.076]  That could never happen in America.
[03:49:39.076 --> 03:49:40.416]  Hello, folks.
[03:49:40.416 --> 03:49:44.437]  You know what happens in America when the EBT system goes down for an hour?
[03:49:44.437 --> 03:49:51.859]  You know, it'll be at least as bad in America because our stores will be looted.
[03:49:51.859 --> 03:49:56.520]  And we're at a point now, strategically thinking, where
[03:49:57.228 --> 03:50:06.512]  The long term, the long view, where the generals are thinking long view, and generals, what they do is come up with contingency planning.
[03:50:06.512 --> 03:50:24.880]  And one of the contingencies the generals are thinking about, even in PC America, they probably would never dare say it aloud or write it down, because if this pandemic fizzles out and somebody records or, you know, two years from now, they're afraid, well, boy, if I ever wrote this memo,
[03:50:25.894 --> 03:50:29.136]  I would be shafted, destroyed.
[03:50:29.136 --> 03:50:30.316]  So they won't even say it.
[03:50:30.316 --> 03:50:32.878]  So PC is working against us.
[03:50:32.878 --> 03:50:41.862]  Do you think that in China, the generals aren't having frank discussions about, just like Dr. Strangelove, okay, the B-52 wing, it's off.
[03:50:41.862 --> 03:50:44.264]  The bombs are gonna drop.
[03:50:44.264 --> 03:50:46.445]  How do we deal with it now?
[03:50:46.445 --> 03:50:50.587]  That's the pandemic world war we're in now.
[03:50:50.587 --> 03:50:51.607]  And in this sense,
[03:50:53.499 --> 03:51:10.771]  The failure is if you have your hospitals overrun and everything gets out of control, your stores are looted, and you're on a short count from there to just total chaos, anarchy, cannibalism.
[03:51:10.771 --> 03:51:19.337]  I guarantee you, bullets have a much longer shelf life than food, and there are probably as many bullets as cans of food in this country.
[03:51:20.126 --> 03:51:27.570]  When the supermarkets are looted, people will still be running around with guns, and that does not pretend well for the future.
[03:51:27.570 --> 03:51:40.078]  So in this context, to the Chinese Communist Party, truly evil men, you know, they look at Mao, and his picture is still up there, you know, at the square in China.
[03:51:40.078 --> 03:51:42.799]  His picture is there after Tiananmen Square.
[03:51:42.799 --> 03:51:46.742]  Mao oversaw the death of probably 60 to 80 million Chinese.
[03:51:47.506 --> 03:51:49.607]  Small price to pay for communism.
[03:51:49.607 --> 03:51:50.968]  They don't care.
[03:51:50.968 --> 03:52:02.115]  So to them, to the Chinese generals that are running their show, if they survive and we totally collapse, they win.
[03:52:02.115 --> 03:52:03.837]  Do you understand that?
[03:52:03.837 --> 03:52:15.244]  If America goes like Iran, except Iran where every house has a gun and more bullets than food, then America wipes itself out.
[03:52:15.928 --> 03:52:18.949]  And it will be so wounded, it won't be a factor.
[03:52:18.949 --> 03:52:30.694]  If they can maintain their rigid, hierarchical, you know, forced quarantine, where you either quarantine or you wind up in a quarantine camp where nobody comes back.
[03:52:30.694 --> 03:52:32.995]  You know, that's how you keep a quarantine.
[03:52:32.995 --> 03:52:39.197]  In China, the quarantine means you either quarantine or we take you away and you're never going to be seen again.
[03:52:39.864 --> 03:52:41.925]  Do you think that can work in America?
[03:52:41.925 --> 03:52:52.912]  What if the key element to surviving this coronavirus bug world war, what if the key factor is this social isolation?
[03:52:52.912 --> 03:52:57.995]  Then you're in a situation where your economy is dialed down to almost zero.
[03:52:57.995 --> 03:52:59.876]  There's no industrial output.
[03:52:59.876 --> 03:53:03.779]  Nobody's going to school like in Japan, Korea, Iran.
[03:53:04.463 --> 03:53:05.404]  Um, Italy.
[03:53:05.404 --> 03:53:06.584]  No school!
[03:53:06.584 --> 03:53:08.145]  Okay, that means kids are home.
[03:53:08.145 --> 03:53:10.126]  That means mom doesn't go to work.
[03:53:10.126 --> 03:53:11.707]  And people are afraid to go to work.
[03:53:11.707 --> 03:53:13.488]  They're afraid of being infected.
[03:53:13.488 --> 03:53:15.409]  And they're being told to self-quarantine.
[03:53:15.409 --> 03:53:17.530]  So our economies start dialing down.
[03:53:17.530 --> 03:53:19.331]  Screw the stock market!
[03:53:19.331 --> 03:53:22.292]  You know, we're talking about, will there be enough food?
[03:53:22.292 --> 03:53:27.315]  You know, Chris Martinson over at Peak Prosperity, he calls it this balancing act.
[03:53:27.315 --> 03:53:28.816]  You've got these three elements.
[03:53:29.986 --> 03:53:32.887]  You've got to get the R0 number below 1.
[03:53:32.887 --> 03:53:37.648]  With an R0 number above 1, it's still spreading.
[03:53:37.648 --> 03:53:40.409]  If it's below 1, it starts diminishing.
[03:53:40.409 --> 03:53:43.850]  But if you do that like China, you have no economy.
[03:53:43.850 --> 03:53:46.151]  And the economy starts dialing down to zero.
[03:53:47.020 --> 03:53:50.722]  And in between them, you can't have your hospitals overrun.
[03:53:50.722 --> 03:54:00.588]  If your hospitals were overrun, and they look like, you know, an Iranian morgue, if that's one story below the hospital, how do you think that hospital is doing next week?
[03:54:00.588 --> 03:54:10.874]  Because what happens when the hospital staff, and this is probably starting in Washington State and working out from there, what happens when the hospital staff become infected?
[03:54:10.874 --> 03:54:15.437]  Or they're working double shifts and they start having mistakes with their PPEs?
[03:54:16.544 --> 03:54:18.105]  Or they have nervous breakdowns.
[03:54:18.105 --> 03:54:19.146]  They're exhausted.
[03:54:19.146 --> 03:54:20.767]  They can't work anymore.
[03:54:20.767 --> 03:54:25.029]  They go home after their triple shift and they never come back to the hospital.
[03:54:25.029 --> 03:54:27.851]  That's the hospital being overrun scenario.
[03:54:27.851 --> 03:54:36.816]  So China, in this strategy of this pandemic world war, China's strategy is survive, no matter what it takes.
[03:54:37.483 --> 03:54:39.064]  Anybody suspected?
[03:54:39.064 --> 03:54:40.085]  Quarantine camp.
[03:54:40.085 --> 03:54:41.166]  Wuhan City?
[03:54:41.166 --> 03:54:41.926]  Quarantine.
[03:54:41.926 --> 03:54:42.267]  Dead.
[03:54:42.267 --> 03:54:42.887]  We don't care.
[03:54:42.887 --> 03:54:50.533]  The strategy for China is, we survive, the rest of the world dies.
[03:54:50.533 --> 03:54:53.555]  That's China's Dr. Strangelove strategy.
[03:54:54.404 --> 03:55:06.106]  And we're still in the Baghdad Bob phase with a buffoon Surgeon General saying, don't buy masks because they don't work for you, you ordinary civilian.
[03:55:06.106 --> 03:55:09.207]  And we need them critically for our medical people.
[03:55:09.207 --> 03:55:10.087]  Well, which is it?
[03:55:10.087 --> 03:55:15.769]  I mean, this is a very serious situation we're in.
[03:55:15.769 --> 03:55:17.389]  I hope it peters out.
[03:55:17.389 --> 03:55:19.189]  I don't want to inflict this on anybody.
[03:55:19.189 --> 03:55:22.590]  I don't want my children to suffer this, your children, anybody.
[03:55:23.243 --> 03:55:26.745]  You know, I'm over 60, so theoretically, I'm in the more at risk.
[03:55:26.745 --> 03:55:30.787]  There are probably people out there saying, great, the boomers will all die.
[03:55:30.787 --> 03:55:34.189]  But that's just the disease effect.
[03:55:34.189 --> 03:55:45.455]  The knock-on effects, socially, are going to be looted supermarkets, looted pharmacies, looted liquor stores, looted gun stores, and that's it, folks.
[03:55:45.455 --> 03:55:48.437]  Then we look like, what I've been saying, worst case,
[03:55:49.042 --> 03:55:57.327]  And now I've got to think of a new worst case, like instead of squared cubed, I've been saying Rwanda times Bosnia.
[03:55:57.327 --> 03:56:02.790]  Well, this is going to be Rwanda times Bosnia during a pandemic in America.
[03:56:02.790 --> 03:56:06.152]  How will you let your friends into your house?
[03:56:06.152 --> 03:56:09.114]  Your relatives from far away that are coming and need help.
[03:56:09.114 --> 03:56:12.096]  How can you afford to let them in your house if you're on quarantine?
[03:56:12.096 --> 03:56:15.418]  And they might be bringing a bug, even though they appear completely healthy.
[03:56:17.332 --> 03:56:20.473]  This is a really serious situation, folks.
[03:56:20.473 --> 03:56:21.273]  I hope I'm wrong.
[03:56:21.273 --> 03:56:24.815]  I hope that in a month, everybody's laughing at me and mocking me.
[03:56:24.815 --> 03:56:26.575]  Oh boy, Bracken went off the deep end.
[03:56:26.575 --> 03:56:29.296]  This is like a total joke.
[03:56:29.296 --> 03:56:30.857]  But it's real.
[03:56:30.857 --> 03:56:32.997]  It's very real.
[03:56:32.997 --> 03:56:35.638]  And week by week, we're going to see this.
[03:56:35.638 --> 03:56:45.041]  The difference between China and Iran and Italy and Washington State is just time.
[03:56:45.041 --> 03:56:46.842]  There's no more containment.
[03:56:47.492 --> 03:56:49.953]  Containment is done.
[03:56:49.953 --> 03:56:56.797]  This bug travels for up to three weeks or more asymptomatically while spreading.
[03:56:56.797 --> 03:56:59.679]  So there's no such thing as containment at this point.
[03:56:59.679 --> 03:57:05.021]  There's only social distancing, yeah, the hand washing, the masks, and here's a tip.
[03:57:05.021 --> 03:57:07.343]  Nobody has yet said I'm wrong.
[03:57:07.343 --> 03:57:13.546]  The key to a mask, an N95 mask, is what's called HEPA, HEPA cloth.
[03:57:14.204 --> 03:57:24.053]  It's the N95 is big enough, or the pores are small enough to stop a virus floating on a spit particle, okay?
[03:57:24.053 --> 03:57:32.280]  And vacuum cleaner bags that say HEPA, or any air conditioning filters, things that say HEPA, that's the key.
[03:57:32.280 --> 03:57:36.244]  That's the N95 right there, HEPA.
[03:57:36.244 --> 03:57:39.607]  Next week I hope I'm, we're all laughing at me next week, I hope.
