[00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:03.751]  22 days out from the election, my friends.
[00:00:05.012 --> 00:00:06.873]  And of course the Democrats are going to contest it.
[00:00:07.213 --> 00:00:09.534]  The inauguration is 100 days out.
[00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:11.656]  That's the real number to look at.
[00:00:11.676 --> 00:00:24.063]  Because Pelosi says, out of the 20th amendment, they are intending to hold up the inauguration so that the president then does not get
[00:00:25.416 --> 00:00:32.558]  Installed by the voters, but then the Democrat House will then vote on who becomes the president.
[00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:36.600]  And or they have other procedures where they can go to the states and have them vote and do it.
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.801]  It's going to be a fiasco of biblical, biblical proportions.
[00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:43.322]  And that's their plan.
[00:00:43.362 --> 00:00:44.502]  That's what they're pushing for.
[00:00:44.582 --> 00:00:47.723]  But let's get into it right now.
[00:00:48.143 --> 00:00:49.844]  I got up here about two and a half hours ago.
[00:00:49.864 --> 00:00:53.625]  I've already been getting prepared for a day and a half of this Sunday show.
[00:00:55.765 --> 00:00:58.287]  And I was going through the Gateway Pundit stack of articles.
[00:00:58.307 --> 00:00:59.989]  They had me print all the Gateway Pundit articles.
[00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.893]  And I just reeled back, because I recognized the name.
[00:01:04.793 --> 00:01:10.559]  It's the main global envoy, or the voice of the UN, on the COVID-19 response.
[00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:12.701]  He's in line to be the head of the WHO next.
[00:01:13.601 --> 00:01:17.105]  And he came out and said, we've got to end the lockdowns and end the COVID-19 responses.
[00:01:17.965 --> 00:01:19.887]  It's causing way more death than it's saving.
[00:01:19.907 --> 00:01:20.548]  This is insane.
[00:01:22.529 --> 00:01:26.451]  So, you hear the record skip, you hear the car crash noise right there.
[00:01:28.592 --> 00:01:37.216]  It was the UN back in December of last year said, hey, vaccines are killing people, they're untested, we need to pause vaccines, the public doesn't believe in them, the doctors don't believe in them.
[00:01:37.577 --> 00:01:40.818]  But they said, but we're just giving them by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told what to do.
[00:01:41.178 --> 00:01:43.940]  So even the UN, the global government system itself,
[00:01:45.387 --> 00:01:46.047]  It's just a puppet.
[00:01:46.707 --> 00:01:48.728]  And what they say is God.
[00:01:49.628 --> 00:01:55.150]  When they say it, Big Tech says, that's policy, that's the end of it, you're not allowed to go against that even if you're a medical doctor.
[00:01:55.871 --> 00:02:04.714]  They say you don't need vitamin D, then you can't say as a medical doctor you need vitamin D. They say you don't need vitamin C, the FBI will SWAT team you.
[00:02:06.994 --> 00:02:11.696]  But now Fauci said you need a certificate, oh wait, okay, we'll drop the charges, Fauci's God.
[00:02:11.976 --> 00:02:14.717]  So Fauci's God, Bill Gates is God, the UN's God,
[00:02:16.001 --> 00:02:16.902]  None of us have any rights.
[00:02:17.582 --> 00:02:26.888]  But now even the UN's head envoy for global COVID-19 response comes out, covered next segment, and says, we've got to stop this.
[00:02:26.969 --> 00:02:29.190]  This is causing millions to die already.
[00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.731]  Hundreds of millions are going to die.
[00:02:31.492 --> 00:02:32.933]  Well, what do you think the plan is?
[00:02:32.953 --> 00:02:36.835]  But see, I don't want to judge this individual, but he's up at this high level.
[00:02:36.855 --> 00:02:37.736]  I looked at his pedigree.
[00:02:37.936 --> 00:02:39.017]  It's pretty, pretty globalist.
[00:02:40.231 --> 00:02:40.631]  Obviously.
[00:02:41.452 --> 00:02:45.016]  But even some of these people get to a moment of truth and wake up finally.
[00:02:45.676 --> 00:02:49.540]  But regardless, the horse already left the barn.
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.281]  Cow's already left the barn.
[00:02:51.742 --> 00:02:52.703]  Genie's already out of the bottle.
[00:02:54.192 --> 00:02:55.173]  Train already left the station.
[00:02:55.993 --> 00:03:01.296]  And it's already going to be devastating, de-de-de-de-devastating to our economy.
[00:03:01.316 --> 00:03:03.717]  It's going to put millions of people out of work.
[00:03:03.777 --> 00:03:05.818]  It's going to bankrupt tens of millions in the Western world.
[00:03:06.218 --> 00:03:08.019]  But the third world, it's already a death sentence.
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.560]  Millions are already dead.
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.763]  And I want the left and the Democrats and Fauci and Gates to know, we know they're behind it.
[00:03:17.845 --> 00:03:19.926]  So they can be discredited and exposed for
[00:03:21.038 --> 00:03:22.739]  The progenitors of the Nazis.
[00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.601]  They're not sons of the Nazis.
[00:03:24.621 --> 00:03:26.102]  They're not neo-Nazis.
[00:03:26.362 --> 00:03:27.123]  They're not Nazis.
[00:03:27.523 --> 00:03:32.527]  They're the eugenics global scientific control freak cult that the Nazis were just a spinoff of.
[00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:35.989]  But the Nazis wanted to make it based around Aryan white people.
[00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:37.651]  The globalists want to kill everybody.
[00:03:39.392 --> 00:03:43.615]  In fact, they don't like people that they see as elitist or high IQ.
[00:03:43.635 --> 00:03:46.918]  So it's even more aggressive than the Nazis, if that's possible.
[00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:52.259]  So, truly sick, true elitism, we have this massive info.
[00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:54.781]  We're going to break it all down when we come back.
[00:03:56.403 --> 00:04:07.273]  And then the election, and then the ongoing COVID lockdowns, and then Keith Olbermann saying arrest Trump as a terrorist, arrest all his supporters, destroy us, put us in gulags.
[00:04:07.734 --> 00:04:08.955]  I mean, you talk about a crazy
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.241]  And you've got the New York Times calling for the U.N.
[00:04:12.261 --> 00:04:13.122]  to take over the U.S.
[00:04:13.422 --> 00:04:14.522]  More articles out on that.
[00:04:14.602 --> 00:04:22.467]  And you've got a left-wing Antifa security guard shooting an unarmed man to death in Denver at a demonstration at a Patriot prayer group.
[00:04:22.747 --> 00:04:23.948]  The media trying to cover that up.
[00:04:24.148 --> 00:04:27.150]  And those guys were going to kidnap the Michigan governor.
[00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.412]  It's now confirmed they're all Antifa and BLM.
[00:04:30.892 --> 00:04:31.753]  Not just a few of them.
[00:04:32.053 --> 00:04:34.915]  There are a bunch of leftist, libtard terrorists.
[00:04:35.255 --> 00:04:37.036]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:37.196 --> 00:04:38.197]  22 days to the election.
[00:04:39.298 --> 00:04:47.022]  But that date is now not important because the Democrats that each state have set on record, they're going to challenge the whole thing.
[00:04:47.902 --> 00:04:48.642]  And so we are 100 days out.
[00:04:50.896 --> 00:04:54.238]  After Election Day we'll be 79 days out.
[00:04:54.778 --> 00:04:56.259]  The 79 days of hell.
[00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.002]  The attempts to break up this country and bring us down and put us under world government.
[00:05:01.062 --> 00:05:02.282]  It's all been announced.
[00:05:03.123 --> 00:05:06.325]  More articles in the Boston Globe, the LA Times, you name it.
[00:05:06.825 --> 00:05:10.667]  Agreeing with the New York Times that the UN should come in and oversee our elections.
[00:05:11.427 --> 00:05:12.928]  That we should be put under world government.
[00:05:13.989 --> 00:05:16.770]  It's simply amazing to be living during this time.
[00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.951]  That's all coming up.
[00:05:20.526 --> 00:05:34.309]  Meanwhile, this is not a joke, the Major Mathematic Association of the United States says 2 plus 2 is racist, 2 plus 2 equals 4 is racist, and that mathematics is white and bad and is not real.
[00:05:35.609 --> 00:05:43.291]  So we've now officially, I'm not joking, entered 1984 where Winston's being tortured and he says the ability to say 2 plus 2 equals 4 is freedom.
[00:05:43.971 --> 00:05:47.572]  By the end of it, O'Brien tortures him so bad he believes it's whatever number O'Brien says.
[00:05:48.332 --> 00:05:53.333]  Math Association says math inherently carries human bias, citing critical race theory.
[00:05:55.933 --> 00:06:00.814]  Also, Ghislaine Maxwell, as we find out, attended anti-human trafficking summits.
[00:06:00.854 --> 00:06:01.654]  Well, of course she did.
[00:06:03.215 --> 00:06:03.775]  The head of, uh,
[00:06:05.592 --> 00:06:10.642]  The Amber Alert System that gives them the database was convicted of child trafficking and changed her name.
[00:06:10.662 --> 00:06:13.328]  I mean, who do you think these people are?
[00:06:13.368 --> 00:06:14.710]  They're in command!
[00:06:16.115 --> 00:06:25.197]  And there's no place you want to be when you're running this stuff better than in the position of tracking children and others that are missing.
[00:06:25.237 --> 00:06:27.438]  That's all coming up.
[00:06:27.498 --> 00:06:33.839]  And the left is so mad that Trump's got a huge bust of child trafficking, child rape, child murder, snuff films.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.281]  I've got a stack of news where they're just busting them all over the U.S., all over the world.
[00:06:38.621 --> 00:06:43.602]  And the desperate leftist media just gets more and more scared because their religion is pedophilia.
[00:06:44.926 --> 00:06:49.009]  They take over every major institution, not just the Catholic Church, not just Penn State.
[00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:51.290]  But we're learning everything.
[00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.291]  That's all coming up as well.
[00:06:54.712 --> 00:07:00.416]  And we also have a left-wing security guard charged with first-degree murder in Denver, shooting a Trump supporter.
[00:07:01.547 --> 00:07:02.768]  The media tried to spin it.
[00:07:03.529 --> 00:07:12.817]  First said it was a right-winger who killed somebody, then they had to admit that it was an Antifa supporter who worked for local Channel 9 who had bragged about how he was going to get right-wingers.
[00:07:13.437 --> 00:07:17.261]  And he executed a guy shooting him in the head at point-blank range.
[00:07:17.281 --> 00:07:22.605]  It's a very powerful report at Band.Video and Infowars.com by John Baum.
[00:07:22.825 --> 00:07:24.707]  Execution by liberal media in Denver.
[00:07:24.747 --> 00:07:28.911]  So it's not just Antifa or BLM that stalks
[00:07:29.943 --> 00:07:32.984]  Patriot Prayer Group meetings in Portland or in Denver.
[00:07:33.664 --> 00:07:35.204]  It's now Channel 9.
[00:07:36.864 --> 00:07:58.568]  They have a Black Lives Matter provocateur with a shirt saying Black Guns Matter screaming and starting a fight over and over again with a security guard and with somebody else and trying to start a fight and then finally he runs off and the security guard shoots the white guy dead in the head.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.761]  So that's all coming up.
[00:08:02.801 --> 00:08:04.082]  I don't know if we should show these videos.
[00:08:04.102 --> 00:08:04.802]  We probably will.
[00:08:04.822 --> 00:08:06.764]  They're all up on InfoWars.com.
[00:08:06.784 --> 00:08:08.665]  They're up on NewsWars.com.
[00:08:08.685 --> 00:08:13.088]  But yes, later, parental discretion advised, we will show this on air.
[00:08:13.148 --> 00:08:15.169]  But there you go.
[00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:18.392]  This is what they've turned us into.
[00:08:19.312 --> 00:08:19.652]  Okay.
[00:08:22.875 --> 00:08:23.415]  Let me do this.
[00:08:28.427 --> 00:08:34.850]  Let me get to Keith Olbermann first, and the climate the left's put out, and then all the different media outlets calling for a coup against President Trump.
[00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:40.972]  And not just a coup, but his supporters need to be destroyed, and need to be put in prisons as well.
[00:08:41.332 --> 00:08:43.913]  That censoring us off of the internet isn't enough.
[00:08:45.774 --> 00:08:53.037]  Now we need to be hunted down, and we need to be... we need to be killed.
[00:08:54.793 --> 00:08:57.914]  Trump can be and must be expunged.
[00:09:24.648 --> 00:09:30.231]  The hate he has triggered, the Pandora's box he has opened, they will not be so easily destroyed.
[00:09:31.512 --> 00:09:33.573]  So, let us brace ourselves.
[00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:35.374]  The task is twofold.
[00:09:35.754 --> 00:09:40.937]  The terrorist Trump must be defeated, must be destroyed, must be devoured at the ballot box.
[00:09:41.197 --> 00:09:53.384]  And then he, and his enablers, and his supporters, and his collaborators, and the Mike Lees, and the William Bars, and the Sean Hannity's, and the Mike Pence's, and the Rudy Giuliani's, and the Kyle Rittenhouse's,
[00:09:53.604 --> 00:10:07.473]  And the Amy Coney Barrett's must be prosecuted and convicted and removed from our society while we try to rebuild it and to rebuild the world Trump has nearly destroyed by turning it over to a virus.
[00:10:08.652 --> 00:10:16.096]  Remember it, even as we dream of a return to reality and safety and the country for which our forefathers died.
[00:10:16.396 --> 00:10:26.022]  That the fight is not just to win an election, but to win it by enough to chase, at least for a moment, Trump and the maggots off the stage.
[00:10:26.802 --> 00:10:28.763]  And then try to clean up what they left.
[00:10:29.484 --> 00:10:35.207]  Remember it, even though to remember it means remembering that the fight does not end November 3rd.
[00:10:35.867 --> 00:10:36.748]  But in many ways,
[00:10:37.472 --> 00:10:39.013]  We'll only begin that day.
[00:10:40.855 --> 00:10:49.542]  So, once they win the election, they think they're going to persecute us and put federal judges in prison and attack us because we're bad.
[00:10:51.023 --> 00:10:52.484]  This is what the universities have bred.
[00:10:52.604 --> 00:10:55.766]  Big money, big banks, the Communist Chinese.
[00:10:56.347 --> 00:10:57.428]  They want authoritarianism.
[00:10:58.933 --> 00:11:01.855]  And the whole world is run by these big corporations now.
[00:11:01.875 --> 00:11:04.557]  They look at America and think, well, we've already owned their debt.
[00:11:04.597 --> 00:11:06.699]  We already basically have control of their country.
[00:11:07.299 --> 00:11:08.260]  We control their media.
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:24.151]  So we can certainly now waltz in and have people say to them, we're going to arrest you.
[00:11:24.792 --> 00:11:25.892]  We're going to dominate you.
[00:11:25.912 --> 00:11:27.654]  We're going to destroy you.
[00:11:29.264 --> 00:11:30.266]  And that's just the way it is.
[00:11:31.969 --> 00:11:33.552]  But what's frustrating about that is...
[00:11:34.841 --> 00:11:39.705]  When you look at the left and the big corporations they work for, they're posing as if they're these underdogs.
[00:11:39.725 --> 00:11:42.908]  They're posing as if they're these little nobodies with no power.
[00:11:42.928 --> 00:12:01.765]  They've got the whole media behind them, the big banks behind them, all the big corporations behind them, all these foreign authoritarian governments, the communist Chinese, the EU, radical Islam behind them, all this power that doesn't like the fact that Americans still have a big middle class, or that America is one of the few countries where we can own guns and defend ourselves.
[00:12:02.742 --> 00:12:08.439]  And then meanwhile, all of the big tech companies, but particularly Apple, and particularly...
[00:12:09.522 --> 00:12:15.746]  Google are getting components from slave camps with Christians, Buddhists, and Muslims in them.
[00:12:16.166 --> 00:12:17.127]  They keep them segregated.
[00:12:17.447 --> 00:12:20.529]  Three million Muslims, a million Christians, a million Buddhists.
[00:12:20.749 --> 00:12:35.379]  They admit, they harvest their organs, they kill them for their religious beliefs, and the left sits there and celebrates it and thinks it's funny and thinks it's cute, and then tells us how President Trump, who didn't want one-sided trade deals with the Communist Chinese,
[00:12:36.943 --> 00:12:42.006]  And who doesn't like the human rights abuses, and who speaks out against it, that he's the bad guy.
[00:12:44.828 --> 00:12:47.970]  And they shake their fingers at us and tell us that we're Hitler.
[00:12:49.271 --> 00:13:01.318]  When it's Trump trying to end the global lockdown, and it's Trump trying to point out that COVID-19 is way overblown, and kills less than the flu on average, and they're counting flu deaths and pneumonia deaths in the COVID column.
[00:13:03.097 --> 00:13:07.660]  That only super obese, super sick people are dying from this.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.602]  And the idea that they can protect you from it is impossible!
[00:13:15.324 --> 00:13:16.425]  The left isn't the left.
[00:13:16.625 --> 00:13:17.366]  They're not liberals.
[00:13:17.646 --> 00:13:22.689]  They're just people that echo what these global corporate systems say.
[00:13:24.161 --> 00:13:26.784]  So there's the big headline up on InfoWars.com.
[00:13:27.284 --> 00:13:28.365]  Global bombshell!
[00:13:29.166 --> 00:13:32.990]  UN says COVID restrictions and lockdowns are killing millions.
[00:13:33.390 --> 00:13:34.311]  Must stop!
[00:13:35.533 --> 00:13:39.376]  And I'll show you the evidence of that and the head UN envoy saying it.
[00:13:40.373 --> 00:13:42.675]  When we come back, this is really a big deal.
[00:13:42.975 --> 00:13:44.817]  And National followed in a story about this as well.
[00:13:44.997 --> 00:13:46.198]  This is breaking all over the place.
[00:13:46.598 --> 00:13:57.848]  World Bank, UN, Harvard, think tanks, all warn COVID-19 lockdowns response leading to global starvation, food disruptions, 2 million already dead.
[00:13:59.707 --> 00:14:03.750]  Not even a million are dead from COVID worldwide, but two million dead from the lockdowns.
[00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:05.592]  And it's about the domino effect.
[00:14:05.852 --> 00:14:10.796]  When the third world collapses, they'll then flood us and the UN will control the crisis they created.
[00:14:11.036 --> 00:14:11.496]  Stay with us.
[00:14:13.358 --> 00:14:14.719]  All right, folks, we are back live.
[00:14:14.779 --> 00:14:15.820]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.201]  What I'm going to do is next hour.
[00:14:19.844 --> 00:14:22.785]  I'm going to get back into the just huge news that the U.N.
[00:14:22.825 --> 00:14:28.508]  admits the lockdown has already killed millions, it's going to kill tens of millions more, and needs to stop.
[00:14:28.648 --> 00:14:33.850]  That's the head envoy over the COVID operations from the U.N.
[00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.630]  to the nation states.
[00:14:35.471 --> 00:14:37.952]  Now, are they covering their ass for the global depression they started?
[00:14:38.312 --> 00:14:39.933]  And the mass death?
[00:14:41.433 --> 00:14:41.813]  Probably.
[00:14:42.554 --> 00:14:45.155]  But regardless, it vindicates what we already knew.
[00:14:46.288 --> 00:14:57.257]  We've got the footage of myself and Owen Schroyer going downtown and having about half the people flip us off and say, burn in hell, when we pointed out the COVID lockdowns are killing the third world.
[00:14:58.518 --> 00:15:00.579]  The other half of folks cheered us on and said, you're right.
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:04.722]  And there was a big rally also that we attended downtown to end the lockdown.
[00:15:06.404 --> 00:15:07.765]  That video is all at VanDotVideo.
[00:15:07.785 --> 00:15:08.285]  That's coming up.
[00:15:08.305 --> 00:15:12.769]  And let's talk about, let's talk about the civil war that the deep state
[00:15:14.045 --> 00:15:16.166]  And others are trying to trigger in this country.
[00:15:17.687 --> 00:15:26.652]  When one of the Patriot Prayer Group folks a month ago got executed in Portland, Oregon, the media tried to cover that up.
[00:15:27.752 --> 00:15:35.676]  And when a man yesterday got executed at another Patriot Prayer Group free speech rally in Denver, the media tried to spin it again.
[00:15:36.577 --> 00:15:38.758]  They also tried to say the people that tried to kidnap the
[00:15:39.997 --> 00:15:44.940]  Governor Whitmer, who the Supreme Court had just ruled is a tyrant, and she had to end her lockdown measures.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:45.801]  She doesn't care.
[00:15:45.841 --> 00:15:47.042]  She says she's not stopping.
[00:15:47.822 --> 00:15:52.545]  Well, as soon as she got in trouble, and as soon as it came out that she was a dictator, basically, what she was doing was illegal.
[00:15:53.005 --> 00:15:57.688]  Oh, they learned about 13 people that were trying to kill her, or trying to kidnap her.
[00:15:57.869 --> 00:16:00.770]  They were talking about both, reportedly.
[00:16:01.131 --> 00:16:03.712]  We learned their Black Lives Matter and Antifa.
[00:16:04.573 --> 00:16:05.934]  Could have known that from their videos with
[00:16:07.179 --> 00:16:07.680]  We're good to go.
[00:16:20.219 --> 00:16:26.682]  Meanwhile, left-wing security guard charged with first-degree murder in Denver shooting of Trump supporter.
[00:16:26.702 --> 00:16:32.404]  We've got his name, all the details up on InfoWars.com.
[00:16:32.424 --> 00:16:40.487]  Identified as Matthew Doloff, a big leftist who bragged about how he was going to deal with Trump supporters.
[00:16:40.967 --> 00:16:45.689]  The Trump supporter shot by leftist local news bodyguard in Denver has been identified.
[00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:49.611]  That's right, he was a bodyguard for Channel 9 News who executed this guy.
[00:16:50.862 --> 00:17:00.005]  The Trump supporters was shot by local news bodyguard in Denver on Saturday has been identified as veteran and cowboy hat designer Lee Kletner.
[00:17:02.947 --> 00:17:05.067]  So we're going to be covering more of that.
[00:17:05.127 --> 00:17:06.048]  Here's a screenshot.
[00:17:06.428 --> 00:17:12.550]  Denver local news bodyguard who killed Trump supporter bragged about harassing and confronting conservatives in the past.
[00:17:13.691 --> 00:17:19.593]  Now he executed one in broad daylight after the Patriot got attacked, shot some of his
[00:17:20.629 --> 00:17:24.012]  Bear spray when he was punched in the face, so he was executed.
[00:17:26.434 --> 00:17:32.039]  Let's go ahead and roll John Bowne's report dealing with this.
[00:17:32.099 --> 00:17:33.120]  It's very powerful.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:36.182]  The media now is executing American citizens.
[00:17:37.824 --> 00:17:41.847]  And then we're going to come back and play the raw footage of the execution on the other side.
[00:17:41.887 --> 00:17:43.409]  But here is the John Bowne report.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:54.584]  All the left needs is a Hitler-Mussolini-Pol Pot-Chairman Mao-style leader to rally them to a full-blown revolutionary violent overthrow of the United States.
[00:17:54.844 --> 00:18:05.929]  That voice will likely arise from the crumbling ESPN ranks that psychopaths like Keith Olbermann graduate from, jockeying for position with their political theater.
[00:18:06.209 --> 00:18:11.391]  The terrorist Trump must be defeated, must be destroyed, must be devoured at the ballot box.
[00:18:11.631 --> 00:18:32.139]  And then he, and his enablers, and his supporters, and his collaborators, and the Mike Lees, and the William Bars, and the Sean Hannity's, and the Mike Pence's, and the Rudy Giuliani's, and the Kyle Rittenhouse's, and the Amy Coney Barrett's must be prosecuted and convicted and removed from our society while we try to rebuild it.
[00:18:32.619 --> 00:18:36.821]  Spewing totalitarian nonsense that sounds vaguely familiar.
[00:18:36.961 --> 00:18:43.424]  Adolf Hitler's first written comments calling for the annihilation of Jews and it's signed by Hitler himself.
[00:18:43.804 --> 00:18:51.628]  The letter was penned decades before the Holocaust in 1919 when Hitler was a German soldier.
[00:18:52.168 --> 00:18:54.910]  But it reveals his early hatred of Jewish people.
[00:18:55.450 --> 00:19:03.275]  In one section he writes that Jews should be denied rights, with the final aim being the uncompromising removal of Jews altogether.
[00:19:03.295 --> 00:19:13.221]  The Mikhail Rittenhouses and the Amy Coney Barretts must be prosecuted and convicted and removed from our society while we try to rebuild it.
[00:19:13.461 --> 00:19:17.163]  The fight is not just to win an election, but to win it by enough.
[00:19:17.683 --> 00:19:22.905]  To chase, at least for a moment, Trump and the maggots off the stage.
[00:19:23.306 --> 00:19:33.890]  This purely un-American hysterical disinformation that continues to fuel what transpired at a Denver, Colorado communist soup drive for the homeless.
[00:19:34.131 --> 00:19:41.854]  A drive that should have been appropriately titled, A Hurl Soup Cans at Concerned Americans and Defunded Police Events.
[00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:45.476]  A lot of those guys were from UADF, the United American Defense Force.
[00:19:46.296 --> 00:19:50.478]  The other side, the Communist Party, started attacking the cops probably within, what, 20 minutes?
[00:19:50.899 --> 00:19:51.619]  Yeah.
[00:19:51.639 --> 00:19:51.939]  20 minutes.
[00:19:52.039 --> 00:19:53.100]  I saw soup cans.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.040]  I was up there speaking.
[00:19:54.441 --> 00:19:56.001]  Soup cans were flying at the cops.
[00:19:56.221 --> 00:19:58.042]  Again, they said they're doing a soup drive for the homeless.
[00:19:58.983 --> 00:19:59.443]  No, they weren't.
[00:19:59.643 --> 00:20:04.586]  And as a BLM mental patient hurled threats and insults at patriots,
[00:20:05.385 --> 00:20:12.090]  And as a patriot appeared to defend himself with pepper spray after the gun had been drawn, that patriot was shot point blank in the head.
[00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:17.013]  The BLM instigator celebrated as he left the scene, only to be detained shortly thereafter.
[00:20:36.303 --> 00:20:44.966]  The instigator had deceptively been wearing a Black Guns Matter shirt and appears to be the same agitator from a Bernie Sanders rally.
[00:20:45.086 --> 00:20:50.828]  Surprisingly, the shot was not fired by a left-wing radical Antifa BLM supporter.
[00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:57.531]  A patriot was reportedly murdered in cold blood by the bodyguard of a Denver 9 News producer.
[00:20:57.751 --> 00:21:10.579]  Just so we're clear on this, America, patriotic Americans aren't merely being shot in cold blood by Marxists that are supported by the Democratic Party and the Democratic candidates running for the highest office in the land.
[00:21:10.699 --> 00:21:12.901]  Antifa's an idea, not an organization.
[00:21:12.921 --> 00:21:13.361]  You got it.
[00:21:13.421 --> 00:21:13.942]  Not militia.
[00:21:13.962 --> 00:21:15.162]  They're not going to stop.
[00:21:15.563 --> 00:21:18.765]  And everyone beware, because they're not going to stop.
[00:21:18.885 --> 00:21:23.788]  They're not going to stop before Election Day in November, and they're not going to stop after Election Day.
[00:21:24.301 --> 00:21:27.585]  And that should be, everyone should take note of that on both levels.
[00:21:27.745 --> 00:21:30.388]  That this isn't, they're not going to let up, and they should not.
[00:21:30.828 --> 00:21:31.729]  And we should not.
[00:21:31.889 --> 00:21:44.703]  The Liberal 9 News Denver media has now become the center of an investigation where the life of an American citizen was snuffed out in broad daylight by the tyranny of a Mockingbird media goon.
[00:21:45.083 --> 00:21:50.967]  On the other side, the Denver Communist Party, along with self-described Black Lives Matter and Antifa.
[00:21:51.047 --> 00:21:59.973]  They call it a patriot muster, but that's, you know, they used patriot instead of saying racist, or patriot instead of saying nationalist.
[00:21:59.993 --> 00:22:01.634]  So, you know, we see through that.
[00:22:01.934 --> 00:22:08.058]  A security guard contracted by Nine News through the company Pinkerton got into an altercation with another man.
[00:22:08.219 --> 00:22:10.800]  There was a verbal altercation that transpired.
[00:22:12.441 --> 00:22:14.142]  Firearm was discharged.
[00:22:15.123 --> 00:22:17.824]  Individual was shot and later pronounced deceased.
[00:22:18.724 --> 00:22:25.687]  It has been a practice by Nine News to hire private security guards as our crews have been covering protests over the last several months in Denver.
[00:22:26.127 --> 00:22:29.308]  Denver police say no one else was arrested at the rallies.
[00:22:29.448 --> 00:22:32.829]  The bodies of people, groups of people, who nobody elected!
[00:22:32.849 --> 00:22:34.530]  Never!
[00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:39.712]  As a matter of fact, most of the people don't like them at all, and yet they exist.
[00:22:41.012 --> 00:22:42.352]  One of such group is media.
[00:22:43.033 --> 00:22:43.753]  Who elected them?
[00:22:46.938 --> 00:22:50.320]  How come they have so much power?
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.522]  Almost monopolistic power on your mind.
[00:22:53.862 --> 00:22:55.142]  They can rape your mind.
[00:22:55.843 --> 00:22:56.643]  But who elected them?
[00:22:56.743 --> 00:23:05.887]  How come they have a nerve to decide what is good and what is bad for the elected by you, President, and his administration?
[00:23:06.428 --> 00:23:07.268]  Who the hell are they?
[00:23:07.888 --> 00:23:09.169]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:23:11.075 --> 00:23:12.736]  That report is extremely powerful.
[00:23:12.816 --> 00:23:15.337]  It's on Band.Video and Infowars.com.
[00:23:15.397 --> 00:23:16.437]  I suggest you share it.
[00:23:16.997 --> 00:23:18.578]  Execution by liberal media in Denver.
[00:23:18.618 --> 00:23:21.699]  Now the leftist media is actually executing patriots in the street.
[00:23:22.159 --> 00:23:24.280]  Beyond Antifa, they are at war with us.
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:27.581]  We're going to come back into all the big campaign news.
[00:23:28.122 --> 00:23:29.902]  And China threatening to attack the United States.
[00:23:29.922 --> 00:23:30.462]  It's all coming up.
[00:23:31.703 --> 00:23:33.524]  Thank God for the renegades.
[00:23:34.324 --> 00:23:34.884]  Free today.
[00:23:44.791 --> 00:23:50.334]  Some would make him king.
[00:23:50.594 --> 00:23:51.734]  Others couldn't stand for that.
[00:23:51.774 --> 00:23:52.875]  The cross was a solution.
[00:23:52.975 --> 00:23:53.455]  It is October 11, 2020.
[00:24:00.726 --> 00:24:02.907]  On this Sunday Worldwide Transmission.
[00:24:03.647 --> 00:24:11.270]  And I'm very, very blessed to be here with you today and very thankful for you, the viewers and listeners, for being the InfoWar and keeping us on air.
[00:24:11.871 --> 00:24:15.212]  Thank God for you, the renegades against this global tyranny.
[00:24:15.552 --> 00:24:19.053]  Renegades against, literally, the satanic plan of the New World Order.
[00:24:20.374 --> 00:24:22.475]  Okay, I've got incredible stuff with the campaign.
[00:24:22.495 --> 00:24:23.995]  I can fill the two hours very easily.
[00:24:24.015 --> 00:24:27.637]  You've got two hours coming up, what we call Sunday Night Live.
[00:24:28.848 --> 00:24:32.469]  With Owen Schroyer, only six minutes of ads an hour for local stations.
[00:24:32.509 --> 00:24:33.430]  So that's coming up.
[00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:35.570]  I'm sure whatever I don't get to, he'll get to and more.
[00:24:35.610 --> 00:24:40.192]  But you got Biden up there saying just incredible stuff.
[00:24:40.212 --> 00:24:41.232]  I mean, you thought it was crazy.
[00:24:41.693 --> 00:24:44.014]  He said 200 million Americans died of COVID.
[00:24:45.414 --> 00:24:46.734]  Wait till you hear what he said next.
[00:24:46.775 --> 00:24:50.536]  But video tells a billion words.
[00:24:52.278 --> 00:24:54.158]  This is a video up on Infowars.com.
[00:24:54.238 --> 00:24:57.259]  Biden-Harris kickoff bus tour in Arizona.
[00:24:57.639 --> 00:24:59.420]  Not a single person shows up.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.581]  And this happens everywhere they go.
[00:25:05.261 --> 00:25:10.202]  And then Trump shows campaign videos showing no one's there, and Facebook bans them, saying they're misleading!
[00:25:11.422 --> 00:25:15.483]  We've sent people out to cover Democrat events with Joe Biden.
[00:25:15.683 --> 00:25:16.543]  No one's there!
[00:25:17.683 --> 00:25:20.064]  We're talking 50 people in San Antonio!
[00:25:22.691 --> 00:25:27.596]  So when he takes questions, one of our listeners gets the first one in, then the fourth questions one of our people.
[00:25:27.896 --> 00:25:36.686]  I mean, he's a joke, that's why he's hiding and not campaigning, because no one is showing up, which is indicative of what a paper tiger and what a fraud this is.
[00:25:36.706 --> 00:25:39.729]  So, here's part of the Fox News piece out of Arizona.
[00:25:41.155 --> 00:25:42.615]  Not much to see.
[00:25:42.875 --> 00:25:45.696]  I'll step out of the way, but it's kind of boring out here.
[00:25:45.776 --> 00:25:49.477]  So it's not your typical presidential campaign event.
[00:25:49.517 --> 00:25:52.218]  We don't see people rallying outside.
[00:25:52.278 --> 00:25:55.778]  We don't see signs or really much of what's going on.
[00:25:55.838 --> 00:26:07.021]  And I'm told by one of the Biden staffers, local staffers, is that they kind of kept the details about the visit as far as the timing and the exact locations.
[00:26:07.723 --> 00:26:12.444]  And pretty much all of the people that we saw enter into the parking lot about
[00:26:13.532 --> 00:26:19.898]  45 minutes ago, we're with the Biden-Harris campaign and the pool reporters.
[00:26:20.038 --> 00:26:30.508]  So you would expect to see, I mean, this is a pretty big event for the two of them to be campaigning together for the first time since the Democratic National Convention.
[00:26:30.868 --> 00:26:36.693]  Here in Arizona, we've established, our state has established itself as a battleground state.
[00:26:36.733 --> 00:26:37.294]  And so this is
[00:26:37.714 --> 00:26:40.395]  Technically a big event, but not a lot of fanfare.
[00:26:40.495 --> 00:26:43.435]  So we're getting information about what's going on with the media.
[00:26:43.455 --> 00:26:44.236]  Okay, so that's enough.
[00:26:44.376 --> 00:26:46.176]  The full video is on InfoWars.com.
[00:26:47.276 --> 00:26:49.017]  I suggest you share the article, okay?
[00:26:49.117 --> 00:26:50.417]  If you want to expose them.
[00:26:50.437 --> 00:26:53.138]  Because here's the deal, you think, oh, we'll beat them easily.
[00:26:53.538 --> 00:26:54.078]  Oh no!
[00:26:55.899 --> 00:27:00.100]  Oh no, because they're going to contest the election and they're going to call the United Nations in.
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:05.861]  They're going to have all the blue state governors secede according to John Podesta.
[00:27:09.192 --> 00:27:09.932]  Look at these headlines.
[00:27:11.633 --> 00:27:12.553]  Fake poll alert.
[00:27:12.633 --> 00:27:13.974]  Proof Biden's not winning.
[00:27:14.054 --> 00:27:15.614]  Town Hall breaks it all down.
[00:27:15.674 --> 00:27:17.935]  How Trump's really winning with the real poll numbers.
[00:27:17.995 --> 00:27:19.016]  Sure, just like four years ago.
[00:27:20.636 --> 00:27:21.957]  Powered by trust.
[00:27:22.717 --> 00:27:23.577]  ABC News.
[00:27:23.857 --> 00:27:24.477]  Oh, yes.
[00:27:25.538 --> 00:27:26.558]  Powered by trust.
[00:27:27.138 --> 00:27:28.739]  ABC News ought to change their slogan to that.
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.800]  Powered by trust in the pandemic.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.921]  Biden leads by 12 points.
[00:27:34.421 --> 00:27:34.641]  Really?
[00:27:34.681 --> 00:27:36.082]  Hillary was leading by like 35 points.
[00:27:39.465 --> 00:27:41.386]  Taliban slandered CBS fake news.
[00:27:42.007 --> 00:27:43.588]  Refutes claim they endorsed Trump.
[00:27:43.628 --> 00:27:44.288]  Just made up.
[00:27:45.689 --> 00:27:49.792]  Biden says chicanery at polls is the only way he can lose the U.S.
[00:27:49.852 --> 00:27:50.212]  election.
[00:27:52.947 --> 00:27:54.749]  Joe Biden, there's a video, but cue it up.
[00:27:55.409 --> 00:27:59.473]  Babbling about Supreme Court proves he knows nothing about the Constitution.
[00:27:59.853 --> 00:28:03.396]  He says that Trump's packing the court and it's unconstitutional.
[00:28:03.436 --> 00:28:07.640]  No, the Democrats adding four more justices to 13.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:13.525]  Or, I guess like Venezuela packed their court up like 40-something people last time I checked.
[00:28:15.126 --> 00:28:16.307]  That's how communists do it.
[00:28:16.868 --> 00:28:19.149]  Yeah, so go ahead and roll Biden lying.
[00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.510]  Here it is.
[00:28:39.111 --> 00:28:39.752]  Oh, stop this.
[00:28:39.772 --> 00:28:40.272]  Stop it again.
[00:28:41.397 --> 00:28:45.783]  Why am I covering the fact that they have a transcript you can barely understand of him saying it's unconstitutional?
[00:28:46.023 --> 00:28:47.785]  Trump's packing the court right now, which isn't true.
[00:28:48.246 --> 00:28:52.892]  He literally has to virtue signal on a tarmac in the sunshine with high wind.
[00:28:53.313 --> 00:28:55.956]  If you had a deadly disease, you couldn't get it, much less COVID.
[00:28:56.196 --> 00:28:57.118]  It's like a common cold.
[00:28:58.203 --> 00:28:59.624]  I mean, it's all a clown show!
[00:29:00.044 --> 00:29:03.287]  This is the traitors, the chi-coms, and the globalist guy.
[00:29:03.307 --> 00:29:03.907]  Sorry, start it over.
[00:29:03.927 --> 00:29:09.591]  Let's just see if we can understand any of it.
[00:29:27.779 --> 00:29:34.112]  Why wait until after the election?
[00:29:36.750 --> 00:30:01.281]  I mean, this is clown world!
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:08.781]  But it's like, oh, he's winning because he wears the mask.
[00:30:08.821 --> 00:30:09.501]  He's a hero.
[00:30:09.842 --> 00:30:16.845]  He's a subservient idiot of the CHICOMS that, with Bill Gates, started the hysteria, exaggerated the death toll 100-fold, and then did all this.
[00:30:19.946 --> 00:30:26.909]  Meanwhile, even Jake Tapper shreds the Biden campaign, saying that, no, it's not unconstitutional for them to do what they're doing.
[00:30:26.929 --> 00:30:30.611]  All right, now let's talk about what's really going on right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:32.517 --> 00:30:37.501]  Let's talk about what's really going on right here with a delicious overhead shot right here.
[00:30:38.842 --> 00:30:40.864]  Because that's what's really unfolding.
[00:30:43.706 --> 00:30:46.528]  Get ready to resist the Trump coup.
[00:30:47.869 --> 00:30:50.071]  Get ready to resist the Trump coup attempt.
[00:30:50.471 --> 00:30:51.833]  That's the Star Tribune.
[00:30:56.576 --> 00:31:02.121]  How we should defend against an impending Trump coup attempt.
[00:31:03.288 --> 00:31:03.968]  Common dreams.
[00:31:05.629 --> 00:31:10.451]  The Trump campaign is reportedly plotting an election coup to bypass the Biden win.
[00:31:10.851 --> 00:31:11.672]  Vanity fair.
[00:31:11.692 --> 00:31:16.154]  10 things we need to know to stop a coup.
[00:31:19.515 --> 00:31:20.476]  Here's one on the New York Times.
[00:31:20.876 --> 00:31:22.717]  There will be no Trump coup.
[00:31:23.857 --> 00:31:26.418]  And they go on to say we have the military and everybody we're going to remove him.
[00:31:26.638 --> 00:31:28.119]  So they admit a coup in this article.
[00:31:30.316 --> 00:31:35.568]  Meanwhile they attacked Stuart Rhodes for in September 30th saying there's a coup plot against the president.
[00:31:36.751 --> 00:31:38.796]  In Atlantic Monthly.
[00:31:40.526 --> 00:31:53.015]  Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal actually wrote a big, in-depth report called, An American Coup Attempt, and shows where they ran the attempted coup during the campaign, when he was president-elect, after and ever since then.
[00:31:53.055 --> 00:32:01.962]  It actually gives real, concrete examples of them trying the coup, calling it a coup, on TV to give confidence to the coup supporters.
[00:32:03.583 --> 00:32:07.946]  And then, of course, you've got, we'll play the clip in a moment, of good old
[00:32:10.367 --> 00:32:20.034]  Sports commentator they brought back out of retirement, Keith Olbermann, to say that all of Trump's supporters seem to be rounded up as well.
[00:32:21.475 --> 00:32:31.582]  So, they're saying we've got a coup plot, but they can't get anybody at their rallies, nobody shows up, they're mailing all these fake ballots to screw the election up, so they can just dispute it.
[00:32:31.642 --> 00:32:32.763]  They know they're losers.
[00:32:33.083 --> 00:32:35.625]  These are the traitors that sold out to foreign powers.
[00:32:35.665 --> 00:32:36.306]  These are the enemy.
[00:32:37.199 --> 00:32:38.360]  So he says we're the enemy?
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:45.163]  My God, we've got Channel 9 gunning an unarmed man down in Denver for Antifa.
[00:32:45.463 --> 00:32:46.664]  Charged with murder.
[00:32:47.745 --> 00:32:48.105]  Today.
[00:32:48.125 --> 00:32:51.767]  We got Antifa, BLM, and the media killing us.
[00:32:53.208 --> 00:32:55.529]  We got Keith Olbermann saying they're gonna wipe us out.
[00:32:55.809 --> 00:32:57.750]  And then wondering why people go out and do it.
[00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:59.291]  Here's what Keith Olbermann had to say.
[00:33:01.572 --> 00:33:04.794]  Trump can be, and must be, expunged.
[00:33:05.416 --> 00:33:11.018]  The hate he has triggered, the Pandora's box he has opened, they will not be so easily destroyed.
[00:33:12.298 --> 00:33:14.359]  So, let us brace ourselves.
[00:33:14.859 --> 00:33:16.159]  The task is twofold.
[00:33:16.539 --> 00:33:21.721]  The terrorist Trump must be defeated, must be destroyed, must be devoured at the ballot box.
[00:33:21.981 --> 00:33:31.424]  And then he, and his enablers, and his supporters, and his collaborators, and the Mike Lees, and the William Bars, and the Sean Hannity's, and the Mike Pence's,
[00:33:31.684 --> 00:33:42.470]  And the Rudy Giuliani's and the Kyle Rittenhouse's and the Amy Coney Barrett's must be prosecuted and convicted and removed from our society while we try to rebuild it.
[00:33:43.150 --> 00:33:44.051]  And to rebuild... Oh, that's enough.
[00:33:44.071 --> 00:33:44.651]  Did you hear that?
[00:33:44.711 --> 00:33:45.932]  We need to be convicted!
[00:33:46.372 --> 00:33:48.893]  And they've got grand juries open on everybody.
[00:33:48.973 --> 00:33:50.314]  Thousands of Trump supporters.
[00:33:52.355 --> 00:33:59.298]  They've got them open, literally just salivating for the Biden win to just arrest us the minute it happens.
[00:33:59.759 --> 00:34:00.019]  Watch.
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:15.482]  Just another day in 2020, a police shooting decision puts an American community on edge yet again.
[00:34:15.602 --> 00:34:23.765]  This time over the shooting death of 17-year-old Alvin Cole by Wauwatosa police officer Joseph Mensa back in February.
[00:34:23.885 --> 00:34:26.086]  Details of the incident became available.
[00:34:26.346 --> 00:34:33.428]  Officers spotted Cole, another man and a woman, leaving the parking garage south of the Nordstrom store at the local mall.
[00:34:43.088 --> 00:34:45.749]  Police detained the man with him but Cole kept running.
[00:34:45.909 --> 00:34:50.151]  He was pursued by three officers including Mensa and a mall security guard.
[00:34:50.351 --> 00:34:56.734]  A shot was discharged from Cole's vicinity and Cole went to the ground with a firearm in his right hand.
[00:34:59.786 --> 00:35:10.969]  All three officers said Cole was ordered to surrender the firearm, but he instead pointed it in their direction.
[00:35:22.833 --> 00:35:25.375]  Mensa fired five rounds killing Cole.
[00:35:25.515 --> 00:35:32.660]  Cole was too young to legally own a firearm, plus juvenile felony convictions barred him from legally possessing a gun.
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:40.926]  The report went on to say the consequences for illegal gun possession are significant and may have contributed to Mr. Cole's flight from police.
[00:35:41.246 --> 00:35:48.972]  According to the Milwaukee Journal-Senatel, this was the third shooting death by Mensa while in the line of duty in the last five years.
[00:35:49.232 --> 00:35:54.535]  Mensa also shot and killed Antonio Gonzalez in 2015 and Jay Anderson Jr.
[00:35:54.575 --> 00:35:54.975]  in 2016.
[00:35:55.615 --> 00:36:03.640]  Gonzalez went into a suicidal death by cop rage, reportedly brandishing kitchen knives and a sword, and Anderson Jr.
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.381]  was shot six times while sitting in his car.
[00:36:06.521 --> 00:36:09.763]  Whether or not Anderson lunged for a weapon is debatable.
[00:36:10.387 --> 00:36:18.131]  Well, police say a group of protesters showed up outside of a home where Joseph Mensah was staying and things quickly escalated from there.
[00:36:18.431 --> 00:36:24.534]  Police say a group of about 60 people gathered around the home near 100th and Vienna Street and vandalized it.
[00:36:24.894 --> 00:36:31.978]  They say as Mensah tried to talk with the crowd, that's when he was physically assaulted and a shot was fired at the back door.
[00:36:32.358 --> 00:36:41.103]  But of course, this case strays from the Derek Chauvin-George Floyd racist police narrative because both the officer and the victim are black.
[00:36:41.283 --> 00:36:45.546]  But that didn't stop the mob from ramping up the prejudicial poison.
[00:36:45.626 --> 00:36:46.666]  Black Lives Matter?
[00:36:46.686 --> 00:36:47.567]  Absolutely!
[00:36:54.259 --> 00:36:55.379]  As well as all lives.
[00:36:55.659 --> 00:37:00.741]  Wauwatosa authorities aren't taking any chances though, calling a 7 p.m.
[00:37:00.801 --> 00:37:01.561]  to 6 a.m.
[00:37:01.621 --> 00:37:14.904]  curfew, shutting down City Hall until Monday, barring hardware stores from selling anything that could be used to burn or loot property, and shutting down most businesses while the National Guard is on standby.
[00:37:15.124 --> 00:37:22.106]  And since the decision had enough time to marinate, the usual BLM Antifa agitators had time to mobilize.
[00:37:22.486 --> 00:37:29.937]  As CNN and Michelle Obama's fiery but mostly peaceful rioters literally attacked residential homes.
[00:37:49.659 --> 00:37:57.144]  Meanwhile, Kamala Harris used the Charlottesville hoax as a paramount point in her vice presidential debate strategy.
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:24.039]  The need for racial justice, where a young woman was killed, and on the other side there were neo-Nazis carrying tiki torches, shouting racial epithets, anti-Semitic slurs, and Donald Trump, when asked about it, said, there were fine people on both sides.
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.722]  This is who we have as the President of the United States.
[00:38:27.341 --> 00:38:33.805]  Senator Harris conveniently omitted after the President made comments about people on either side of the debate over monuments.
[00:38:34.886 --> 00:38:41.230]  He condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists and has done so repeatedly.
[00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:49.576]  The President of the United States took a debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists.
[00:38:50.757 --> 00:38:57.399]  A total lie used to draw in gullible voters and support the mob mentality destroying America.
[00:38:57.799 --> 00:39:00.779]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:39:17.571 --> 00:39:43.894]  Because we were bullhorning, and also on a loud PA system that was going like five, six blocks up, it's very loud, that the UN-directed, Bill Gates-directed, world government-directed lockdown has already starved two million people to death, according to the UN, and hundreds of millions are set to starve to death, and the world financial system and food supply and delivery supply chain
[00:39:45.666 --> 00:39:46.327]  Is breaking down.
[00:39:46.347 --> 00:39:47.427]  I mean, that's quite a headline.
[00:39:47.748 --> 00:39:48.568]  Global bombshell.
[00:39:48.668 --> 00:39:51.951]  UN says COVID restrictions and lockdowns are killing millions.
[00:39:53.952 --> 00:39:54.573]  Must stop.
[00:39:57.335 --> 00:40:01.098]  And I've got like a four-minute report we're going to play again of us driving through Austin.
[00:40:01.118 --> 00:40:05.541]  But I was out at the park two weeks ago.
[00:40:05.601 --> 00:40:06.242]  You saw the footage.
[00:40:06.262 --> 00:40:06.802]  We played it here.
[00:40:08.984 --> 00:40:15.209]  And I just launched a drone that had a little speaker on it over Zilker Park, downtown Austin, saying, hey, the UN admits
[00:40:16.533 --> 00:40:27.003]  The COVID-19 lockdowns are killing millions, but the UN doesn't ever say, in the lockdowns, they say, give us money to deliver food to people's houses, but they just keep the money and the people die.
[00:40:27.283 --> 00:40:28.284]  We've got the reports right here.
[00:40:29.363 --> 00:40:39.448]  So I came out and I said, how dare the UN COVID program and their head of rapid response and their head envoy and all of them, I said, they're guilty if they don't do something of murder.
[00:40:39.768 --> 00:40:47.952]  Two million have already starved to death, their own numbers, their accurate numbers, and they admit a hundred and something million can starve to death in the next year, 200 plus million in the next two years.
[00:40:48.212 --> 00:40:49.873]  And these are all headlines I'm about to show you.
[00:40:52.534 --> 00:40:54.615]  Because when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[00:40:55.996 --> 00:40:56.256]  Well,
[00:40:58.223 --> 00:40:59.103]  I'll be, you know what?
[00:40:59.123 --> 00:41:13.451]  The WHO Director General Special Envoy on COVID-19 Preparedness and Response came out yesterday, David Nabarro.
[00:41:14.611 --> 00:41:16.152]  Zoom a little bit closer on that for me, please.
[00:41:16.192 --> 00:41:18.593]  A lot of folks are watching on their phones.
[00:41:18.613 --> 00:41:19.234]  They can't see that.
[00:41:19.254 --> 00:41:19.654]  There it is.
[00:41:21.415 --> 00:41:23.616]  He came out and he said,
[00:41:24.952 --> 00:41:27.755]  It's causing a lot more harm than good and needs to stop.
[00:41:28.215 --> 00:41:30.578]  You can read his full statement, Gateway Pundit has an article about it.
[00:41:30.918 --> 00:41:36.083]  And there's the head of the UN vaccine program saying it's killing people, they're covering it up, it's got to stop.
[00:41:36.323 --> 00:41:37.364]  That was December last year.
[00:41:37.585 --> 00:41:48.736]  So they get orders from the big banks that own and run the UN, the Rockefellers set it up, they have Operation Lockstep that said they'll bring in world government and have the UN take over, but the UN itself is just a corporate front group.
[00:41:51.630 --> 00:41:54.311]  Big article on nationalfile.com.
[00:41:54.331 --> 00:42:02.913]  World Bank, UN, Harvard, think tanks all agree and warn COVID-19 lockdowns and response leading to global starvation, food disruptions.
[00:42:02.933 --> 00:42:03.514]  And here's the deal.
[00:42:05.114 --> 00:42:09.015]  Maybe you're a eugenicist like Bill Gates or the Rockefellers.
[00:42:09.455 --> 00:42:10.936]  You think, well, there are too many Africans.
[00:42:11.316 --> 00:42:16.978]  Let's cut off their supply chain and not buy the crops they sell us and not buy the flowers they sell us.
[00:42:16.998 --> 00:42:19.218]  One of the biggest things Africa grows is flowers.
[00:42:19.979 --> 00:42:20.839]  Let's just screw them.
[00:42:21.619 --> 00:42:28.902]  Okay, well the UN is going to use the refugee flows as a political weapon to bring them in and then use them as a political tool to bring us down as well.
[00:42:29.122 --> 00:42:32.484]  Because if you think Bill Gates hates people in Africa, he really hates you.
[00:42:32.744 --> 00:42:37.966]  I don't care what color you are, he wants power and control over everyone.
[00:42:38.266 --> 00:42:38.726]  Period.
[00:42:39.007 --> 00:42:40.767]  This is total domination.
[00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:46.830]  So that's it.
[00:42:48.715 --> 00:42:52.048]  But imagine you walk up to left and say, hey, I need your help.
[00:42:54.019 --> 00:42:54.619]  The U.N.
[00:42:54.779 --> 00:43:00.603]  ordered lockdowns killing millions and millions, hundreds of times more than COVID, and it's designed like that by Bill Gates.
[00:43:00.863 --> 00:43:03.125]  And they just go, shut up, you racist filth!
[00:43:03.885 --> 00:43:14.452]  And they flip you off and get really excited, like they do about abortion, like they do about infanticide or euthanasia of old people, because they have a satanic spirit.
[00:43:14.492 --> 00:43:15.193]  I've been around them.
[00:43:15.453 --> 00:43:17.374]  The average leftist loves death.
[00:43:17.854 --> 00:43:18.755]  They love power.
[00:43:19.335 --> 00:43:22.898]  They love the fact that they're first world and other people aren't.
[00:43:23.658 --> 00:43:24.258]  But here's the difference.
[00:43:24.419 --> 00:43:24.939]  You care.
[00:43:25.379 --> 00:43:26.079]  You might be old.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:26.720]  You might be young.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:27.400]  You might be black.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.041]  You might be white.
[00:43:28.381 --> 00:43:29.662]  You understand you have empathy.
[00:43:30.142 --> 00:43:33.044]  That what is allowed to be done to these poor people will be done to you.
[00:43:33.384 --> 00:43:35.285]  But here's the article at GatewayPundit.com.
[00:43:36.185 --> 00:43:45.131]  Someone tell the radical Democrats WHO backflips on lockdowns and global economy decimated and world's poor are starving to death.
[00:43:45.751 --> 00:43:46.452]  So important.
[00:43:46.512 --> 00:43:47.112]  Full video.
[00:43:47.152 --> 00:43:49.633]  Full articles on InfoWars.com.
[00:43:50.634 --> 00:43:51.895]  But let's roll out to break.
[00:43:53.032 --> 00:43:53.632]  Take your mask off!
[00:43:53.672 --> 00:43:54.213]  Be free again!
[00:43:54.233 --> 00:43:54.833]  Take your mask off!
[00:43:54.933 --> 00:43:55.354]  Be free again!
[00:44:18.632 --> 00:44:20.693]  You must remove your mask.
[00:44:21.733 --> 00:44:28.716]  The mask is a symbol of slavery and a symbol of collapse of the economic world.
[00:44:29.237 --> 00:44:31.478]  Take off your mask!
[00:44:32.398 --> 00:44:34.439]  Take off your mask!
[00:44:34.919 --> 00:44:38.401]  The third world is starving to death because of the lockdown.
[00:44:39.161 --> 00:44:41.002]  The lockdown is killing millions.
[00:44:41.382 --> 00:44:45.764]  COVID-19 is the Deimos Group's global reset.
[00:44:46.804 --> 00:44:48.006]  Free Texas now!
[00:44:48.046 --> 00:44:50.068]  Free Texas now!
[00:44:50.628 --> 00:44:52.050]  Free Texas now!
[00:44:52.670 --> 00:44:54.012]  Free Texas now!
[00:44:54.713 --> 00:44:55.914]  Free Texas now!
[00:45:03.208 --> 00:45:07.231]  And we must re-elect Trump and tell him that he must reject it, too.
[00:45:07.892 --> 00:45:14.597]  And if Governor Abbott doesn't reopen Texas, he's not gonna be living in that mansion anymore!
[00:45:15.137 --> 00:45:17.018]  Our message to Governor Abbott is this.
[00:45:17.639 --> 00:45:21.442]  We now know that they've exaggerated the COVID-19 deaths 99.9%.
[00:45:21.522 --> 00:45:27.226]  We now know they've had false testing that tells folks that died of other things as COVID deaths.
[00:45:27.907 --> 00:45:30.709]  And it's time to end the COVID hoax.
[00:45:36.632 --> 00:45:42.736]  If you continue this lockdown and these face mask orders, you will go down as one of the worst governors in the history of Texas.
[00:45:43.216 --> 00:45:45.037]  And I think it's a shame.
[00:45:54.786 --> 00:46:10.155]  The only time they got mad at me was when I started saying Abbott can turn back, they hate him so much now.
[00:46:12.048 --> 00:46:13.589]  Do not destroy your legacy.
[00:46:13.949 --> 00:46:15.209]  Do not enslave Texas.
[00:46:15.649 --> 00:46:16.629]  Do the right thing.
[00:46:17.250 --> 00:46:18.670]  Admit that you got conned.
[00:46:19.290 --> 00:46:22.191]  Please, you're making Texas hate you forever.
[00:46:23.091 --> 00:46:28.213]  Governor Abbott, the lockdown has already killed 2 million people in Africa.
[00:46:28.733 --> 00:46:29.113]  The U.N.
[00:46:29.193 --> 00:46:31.354]  admits hundreds of millions will starve to death.
[00:46:31.814 --> 00:46:36.276]  And the United Nations is the group with Davos orchestrating the lockdown.
[00:46:36.596 --> 00:46:39.677]  The lockdown is the killer, not COVID-19.
[00:46:40.837 --> 00:46:43.879]  The lockdown is the killer, not COVID-19.
[00:46:43.919 --> 00:46:48.002]  Governor Abbott, I know you're not stupid.
[00:46:48.502 --> 00:46:51.264]  I know you know 94% of the deaths were something else.
[00:46:52.731 --> 00:46:56.952]  In the lockdown, Bill Gates says we're never taking the mask off.
[00:46:57.513 --> 00:47:00.934]  Bill Gates says we're all going to take forced inoculations.
[00:47:01.514 --> 00:47:04.675]  Bill Gates says we are his slaves and he owns us.
[00:47:05.155 --> 00:47:09.376]  And I say Bill Gates can burn in hell!
[00:47:09.677 --> 00:47:10.757]  Burn in hell!
[00:47:11.237 --> 00:47:13.318]  Bill Gates, burn in hell!
[00:47:13.758 --> 00:47:15.919]  Bill Gates, burn in hell!
[00:47:16.319 --> 00:47:16.959]  Bill Gates,
[00:47:17.319 --> 00:47:19.481]  Burn in hell, Bill Gates!
[00:47:19.861 --> 00:47:21.983]  Burn in hell, Bill Gates!
[00:47:22.264 --> 00:47:25.206]  The lockdown is killing millions, not COVID.
[00:47:25.887 --> 00:47:29.270]  The lockdown is still happening in the third world.
[00:47:30.551 --> 00:47:32.273]  This is an economic weapon.
[00:47:32.673 --> 00:47:36.576]  We must stand against the globalists now.
[00:47:37.717 --> 00:47:39.899]  Free the world now.
[00:47:40.911 --> 00:47:43.114]  Free the world now!
[00:47:43.915 --> 00:47:47.960]  Infowars.com stands with human life.
[00:47:48.661 --> 00:47:49.882]  Bill Gates and the U.N.
[00:47:49.902 --> 00:47:55.349]  have launched COVID so they can make us all run into our houses and never leave again.
[00:47:56.221 --> 00:47:59.882]  And then, of course, it's Obama with the Cajuns lady, but look at this lady.
[00:48:00.402 --> 00:48:02.482]  But you don't care that it's Obama with the Cajuns.
[00:48:02.682 --> 00:48:04.283]  You like to live in delusional land.
[00:48:05.663 --> 00:48:06.703]  You say no more Cajuns.
[00:48:07.223 --> 00:48:12.365]  And it is the lockdown that is causing millions and millions to die.
[00:48:13.065 --> 00:48:14.325]  Take your mask off.
[00:48:14.705 --> 00:48:15.625]  Be free again.
[00:48:16.165 --> 00:48:17.326]  Take your mask off.
[00:48:17.706 --> 00:48:18.486]  Be free again.
[00:48:19.735 --> 00:48:24.037]  Alright, that full report is at InfoWars.com, but this is such a huge topic.
[00:48:24.137 --> 00:48:25.558]  Alright, Trump's on the offense.
[00:48:25.578 --> 00:48:26.499]  We'll talk about it when we come back.
[00:48:26.539 --> 00:48:26.959]  Stay with us.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:29.721]  Welcome back, folks.
[00:48:29.761 --> 00:48:30.721]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:48:30.761 --> 00:48:32.722]  Let's let this great music roll a little bit longer.
[00:48:34.964 --> 00:48:40.227]  You know, I talk about my own psychological point of view because it's the only way I can try to describe things to you.
[00:48:41.331 --> 00:48:45.093]  Like, I was doing a lot of research today and ready to come here and do a whole show.
[00:48:46.014 --> 00:48:56.460]  And about an hour and a half before I went live, I saw that the UN head envoy came out and said, yeah, we're killing a lot more people than we're saving with the lockdowns and with the mask and with the economic breakdown.
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:57.180]  We need to stop it.
[00:48:58.101 --> 00:49:01.763]  And then I did a deep dive researching that and who he was and the rest of it.
[00:49:01.783 --> 00:49:05.525]  And it was just, it was just them covering their ass for what they're about to do.
[00:49:05.545 --> 00:49:07.707]  So they can say it was all a big mistake.
[00:49:09.187 --> 00:49:09.568]  And I'm not,
[00:49:10.882 --> 00:49:13.983]  This isn't about me, but people need to get this part if you want to get everything.
[00:49:16.405 --> 00:49:26.009]  I'm not up here totally upset about this because I'm some bleeding heart goody two-shoe that wants to virtue signal that I love black people.
[00:49:31.352 --> 00:49:32.432]  I'm not a fake leftist.
[00:49:33.713 --> 00:49:37.295]  I fundamentally see people being cut off and starved to death as a threat to me.
[00:49:38.376 --> 00:49:42.900]  Yeah, I care about them, I have empathy, but I'm able to analyze why God gave me empathy.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:53.408]  Because if I see my neighbors or somebody 5,000 miles away being enslaved by a group that's already pretty much running my country, do I have solidarity with those people?
[00:49:53.689 --> 00:49:53.989]  Yeah.
[00:49:55.150 --> 00:49:57.992]  You think an admission they're killing them makes me happy?
[00:49:59.253 --> 00:50:02.396]  You think being confirmed again that it's going on?
[00:50:03.117 --> 00:50:03.317]  No!
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:09.582]  Because here's the thing, they admit much more, I'm not going to just be able to sit here anymore and talk about it.
[00:50:11.183 --> 00:50:12.464]  Because they're killing a bunch of people.
[00:50:13.124 --> 00:50:14.005]  And it's not funny!
[00:50:14.025 --> 00:50:21.208]  Let me tell you, people at the UN are scared.
[00:50:21.328 --> 00:50:22.689]  They know what they're putting in those vaccines.
[00:50:22.709 --> 00:50:28.952]  That's why they had that meeting in December, saying, we're told to do this, we're not allowed to test it, and a lot of folks are getting sick and dying.
[00:50:29.853 --> 00:50:31.574]  And then Associated Press comes out and says,
[00:50:33.069 --> 00:50:37.875]  Tens of thousands of kids are dying, hundreds of thousands are getting paralyzed for life!
[00:50:38.776 --> 00:50:50.189]  Well, their family's got to take care of them, where your little daughter or son you love has got no muscles and has got polio in a wheelchair for the rest of their life, because Bill Gates likes to do that to people.
[00:50:52.861 --> 00:50:55.303]  You think AP came out with that because they care?
[00:50:55.583 --> 00:50:56.984]  They did that to cover their ass.
[00:50:57.785 --> 00:51:02.749]  You think Bill Gates goes on CBS and says, yeah, 700,000 a year and get sick or die?
[00:51:03.690 --> 00:51:08.754]  You think they told you 100% get sick with one of his vaccines and 80% with the other because they like you?
[00:51:08.954 --> 00:51:13.438]  They're getting ready to make you take it and admit it all, even though it's going to hurt you!
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:20.824]  You know, if you studied the Aztecs, the Babylonians, all these other cultures, the Druids,
[00:51:22.208 --> 00:51:25.949]  Mothers and fathers willingly would lead their three-year-olds up to an altar.
[00:51:27.269 --> 00:51:28.990]  And there'd be the high priest in his outfit.
[00:51:30.430 --> 00:51:33.971]  Back in the day, in most cultures, he had his face covered in case somebody got pissed later.
[00:51:34.571 --> 00:51:44.013]  They'd give them their son or daughter, and they'd take that kid up there, and they'd tie their hands, or they'd give them a drink of drugs to make them submit, and they'd cut their heart out right in front of their parents.
[00:51:44.254 --> 00:51:46.054]  That's government wanting power.
[00:51:46.920 --> 00:51:51.443]  Every culture is taken over by sickos that make you- they're favorites of three-year-old.
[00:51:51.963 --> 00:51:56.166]  Lead your little three-year-old up there to get killed in front of the whole village.
[00:51:56.786 --> 00:51:58.507]  You think you're gonna question the village now?
[00:51:58.808 --> 00:52:01.749]  And it's never the- it's never the- the chiefs that do this.
[00:52:02.110 --> 00:52:07.173]  You'll have strong chiefs, strong group, organized, are good at whatever, good at agriculture, good at war.
[00:52:07.613 --> 00:52:09.394]  You'll build a little- little- little tribe.
[00:52:10.315 --> 00:52:13.437]  And right when the tribe hits about 5,000 people in anthropology,
[00:52:15.319 --> 00:52:16.420]  The priest class rises.
[00:52:17.381 --> 00:52:24.509]  And every time they serve dark entities, the priests are taking drugs that let them interface with the entities, interdimensionally.
[00:52:25.050 --> 00:52:26.571]  This is the best theory on what's going on.
[00:52:26.591 --> 00:52:27.573]  It's what the Pentagon believes.
[00:52:29.014 --> 00:52:32.538]  And they give them dark knowledge on how to control people, and that's what they do.
[00:52:33.099 --> 00:52:34.140]  And then the priests take over.
[00:52:35.742 --> 00:52:44.905]  Well, I'm not leading my family up that damn pit to have them thrown off into a pit of water, to have their heart cut out, to serve this satanic system.
[00:52:45.165 --> 00:52:49.506]  But that's all any of this is, and make no mistakes ever.
[00:52:51.727 --> 00:53:01.430]  That's what abortion is, it's what infanticide is, it's what euthanasia is, it's the same cult that every culture ends up following during their decline right before they collapse.
[00:53:04.912 --> 00:53:08.855]  And now they want us to lead our sons in, because that's what the vaccines are designed for, to target males.
[00:53:09.756 --> 00:53:12.858]  That's what, 95% of autism's boys, it's designed for them.
[00:53:13.539 --> 00:53:15.621]  Blood-brain barrier on boys is about a third as thick.
[00:53:16.982 --> 00:53:18.303]  And they hit our boys with lobotomy.
[00:53:18.863 --> 00:53:24.528]  The average boy gets an IQ reduction, health problems in life, neurological disorders, Parkinson's later.
[00:53:25.068 --> 00:53:31.233]  But, you know, if you get overcooked, like Gates talks about, he goes, yeah, some people get really sick so that all of you have the effect.
[00:53:31.633 --> 00:53:33.395]  And the effect is sterilization.
[00:53:34.701 --> 00:53:35.862]  But it can't be everybody.
[00:53:35.902 --> 00:53:36.962]  It's got to be a percentage.
[00:53:37.643 --> 00:53:40.445]  Then they hit you with enough things, nobody can tell what hit you.
[00:53:40.885 --> 00:53:43.186]  It's called killing you softly.
[00:53:44.147 --> 00:53:45.408]  Soft kill weapons.
[00:53:45.788 --> 00:53:46.989]  Killing you quietly.
[00:53:48.149 --> 00:53:50.251]  Brad Pitt had a stupid movie where he's a hitman.
[00:53:50.271 --> 00:53:51.131]  I forget the name.
[00:53:51.191 --> 00:53:52.772]  It's like killing you softly or something.
[00:53:53.213 --> 00:53:54.353]  It's not a term he came up with.
[00:53:54.393 --> 00:53:55.234]  It's a Pentagon term.
[00:53:56.315 --> 00:53:57.675]  He has a guy who helped him do a murder.
[00:53:57.976 --> 00:53:59.737]  He walks around, hey, thanks a lot, shoots him in the head.
[00:54:01.038 --> 00:54:01.618]  Never knew what hit him.
[00:54:02.398 --> 00:54:02.959]  Well, guess what?
[00:54:04.278 --> 00:54:05.339]  Guess what, Bill Gates?
[00:54:05.539 --> 00:54:06.280]  Guess what, world?
[00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:07.921]  We know what hit us.
[00:54:08.982 --> 00:54:12.885]  And we're not gonna play along with you just so I can get some seat at your table.
[00:54:16.488 --> 00:54:22.032]  And so, the UN head of vaccine program says, don't take vaccines, they're killing people.
[00:54:22.112 --> 00:54:30.559]  And then you see this huge Operation Gates launches for who he represents to like just say, okay, it is killing people and it is making you sick and you're gonna take it!
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:33.241]  You're gonna take it!
[00:54:35.285 --> 00:54:43.650]  Now does that mean as a man I'm going to let the UN weaponize Africa when it collapses and then march tens of millions, hundreds of millions of Africans in to take over?
[00:54:43.710 --> 00:54:43.911]  No.
[00:54:44.271 --> 00:54:45.992]  I'm against that and I'll fight them.
[00:54:46.992 --> 00:54:50.215]  But I want them to be free in their country and if they come here illegally that's fine.
[00:54:50.675 --> 00:54:55.378]  But I understand, see that's, people don't have third dimensional warfare which is even a base level.
[00:54:55.738 --> 00:54:56.859]  Much less fourth, fifth, sixth.
[00:54:58.462 --> 00:55:00.783]  They go, well, my God, if you're for the third world, you should let everybody in.
[00:55:00.883 --> 00:55:02.123]  Oh, so the Democrats can run them?
[00:55:02.543 --> 00:55:12.006]  See, the globalists are sterilizing, poisoning, euthanizing people all over the world, but then they brainwash certain groups and bring them here as a weapon, because they're attacking us, too.
[00:55:12.346 --> 00:55:15.047]  You think Bill Gates is just a white supremacist?
[00:55:15.647 --> 00:55:17.068]  He's an anti-humanist.
[00:55:18.828 --> 00:55:21.569]  He's a post-humanist exterminist.
[00:55:25.345 --> 00:55:27.789]  He believes humanity's broken because he's broken.
[00:55:28.109 --> 00:55:31.714]  He's projecting his hate of himself onto you and me.
[00:55:33.456 --> 00:55:40.566]  So I give human dignity to everybody because I demand it myself, and I will stand up for everybody's right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness, but not at my expense.
[00:55:42.059 --> 00:55:49.965]  And when they implode the third world, which they're doing with this, and as the collapse becomes evident and hundreds of millions are dying, by next year already millions are dead.
[00:55:50.646 --> 00:55:53.308]  It's a domino effect though, it's logarithmic.
[00:55:53.608 --> 00:55:59.253]  The UN is going, oh my god, everybody's starving to death, we need to stop this, because they're covering their demonic assets.
[00:56:01.690 --> 00:56:14.114]  And then, when they're surging over the borders, and things are being destroyed, and everything's collapsing, and we're permanently all screwed, Africans, Americans, it doesn't matter, remember who did it to you!
[00:56:15.055 --> 00:56:15.875]  Have a memory!
[00:56:17.776 --> 00:56:20.197]  What does the Globalist Minions always say?
[00:56:20.477 --> 00:56:22.317]  What does Jonathan Gruber say?
[00:56:22.617 --> 00:56:24.198]  What does Rothkopf say?
[00:56:24.238 --> 00:56:25.138]  What does Kissinger say?
[00:56:25.178 --> 00:56:29.880]  They say, thank God you don't have a memory.
[00:56:33.047 --> 00:56:36.891]  Africa can be a beautiful jewel, high-tech, incredible science, great people.
[00:56:37.071 --> 00:56:38.392]  They've never been allowed to have it.
[00:56:38.572 --> 00:56:43.096]  Just like we got it for a little bit with the Renaissance, it's about to be taken from us as well.
[00:56:43.777 --> 00:56:52.064]  And we'll be kept poor in shacks so the globalists can feel above us, then they'll just phase our ass out, robot police everywhere, hell on earth!
[00:56:52.765 --> 00:56:55.628]  But I say, no matter what color you are or where you came from, you've got red blood.
[00:56:55.848 --> 00:57:06.980]  And I say, as humans, we can come together and recognize this threat, and unify, and destroy the globalist, satanic takeover, and then we'll have unlimited living space in the stars!
[00:57:07.181 --> 00:57:10.845]  But we must first pass through the gate of Satan!
[00:57:12.828 --> 00:57:15.010]  I got no friends because they read the papers.
[00:57:15.050 --> 00:57:18.913]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:57:19.653 --> 00:57:30.282]  You know, I actually became a better person being persecuted by the globalists.
[00:57:30.302 --> 00:57:36.066]  I'm still not perfect, far from it, but I'm a much, much better person than I used to be.
[00:57:37.347 --> 00:57:39.029]  God, I used to care what people thought about me.
[00:57:40.663 --> 00:57:42.144]  Not as much as others, but I still did.
[00:57:42.785 --> 00:57:44.426]  It's so freeing not to give a damn.
[00:57:45.246 --> 00:57:48.769]  The only integrity I have is with God, and that's the only person that matters at the end of the day.
[00:57:49.949 --> 00:57:52.791]  And I'm ashamed of myself in front of God, but I'm getting better.
[00:57:55.293 --> 00:57:56.834]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:57:56.934 --> 00:58:00.317]  Okay, let's talk cold, hard facts in Turkey here.
[00:58:01.237 --> 00:58:02.098]  Let's look at these headlines.
[00:58:02.118 --> 00:58:05.020]  This is out of the Star Tribune, LA Times, New York Times.
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:06.281]  I mean, these are all the headlines right here.
[00:58:06.721 --> 00:58:08.983]  Get ready to resist the Trump coup attempt.
[00:58:09.889 --> 00:58:15.112]  Remember, the left doesn't want a coup, they just call it a coup, they've been caught doing a coup, but Trump's going to have a coup.
[00:58:15.693 --> 00:58:29.121]  And they define it in all these articles as the same talking point, that if Trump challenges the election in any way, or challenges fake ballots or dead cats voting, it's now dead cats voting, literally, that he's a dictator.
[00:58:30.882 --> 00:58:32.944]  Well that's oxymoronic.
[00:58:32.984 --> 00:58:36.446]  Well yeah, they don't care, they think their constituents are morons.
[00:58:37.659 --> 00:58:38.099]  Which they are.
[00:58:38.119 --> 00:58:40.160]  And they think they'll go out and riot.
[00:58:41.501 --> 00:58:46.123]  And then when it's a bunch of white meth heads out burning stuff down, they'll say, oh look, it's Black Lives Matter.
[00:58:46.423 --> 00:58:52.426]  Trump's attacking the black people in a desperate attempt to manipulate black Americans into this.
[00:58:52.486 --> 00:58:53.526]  And I don't see it working.
[00:58:53.566 --> 00:58:54.427]  What do you see happening?
[00:58:54.787 --> 00:58:55.627]  I see a backlash.
[00:58:56.628 --> 00:58:57.148]  Here's another one.
[00:58:57.188 --> 00:59:00.670]  How we should defend against the impending Trump coup.
[00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:05.772]  It's been the deep state trying to coup him with Russiagate and all the rest of it.
[00:59:07.469 --> 00:59:08.069]  Here's another one.
[00:59:08.489 --> 00:59:09.110]  Vanity Fair.
[00:59:09.450 --> 00:59:14.813]  The Trump campaign is reportedly plotting an election coup to bypass a Biden win.
[00:59:16.213 --> 00:59:16.753]  All made up.
[00:59:17.194 --> 00:59:18.434]  You read the articles, which you already knew.
[00:59:18.754 --> 00:59:21.356]  They're like, yeah, we're going to challenge it if there's evidence of fraud.
[00:59:21.656 --> 00:59:22.816]  They call that bypass.
[00:59:24.257 --> 00:59:26.158]  10 things you know about a way to stop a coup.
[00:59:27.378 --> 00:59:28.139]  Then there's this article.
[00:59:30.114 --> 00:59:31.355]  There will be no coup.
[00:59:32.096 --> 00:59:38.683]  And the article goes on to say he's a coward, he's a loser, he's a paper tiger, he's a fraud.
[00:59:42.427 --> 00:59:44.869]  Trump won't stand up when we take it from him.
[00:59:46.431 --> 00:59:47.672]  This is a classic story of
[00:59:48.692 --> 00:59:52.495]  Somebody in a newspaper that hates America trying to get other people to go out.
[00:59:52.575 --> 00:59:53.937]  Oh, you kicked that guy's ass?
[00:59:54.237 --> 00:59:55.598]  Like, well, he's about six foot five.
[00:59:55.618 --> 00:59:58.741]  He's got arms bigger than his tree trunks and legs are even bigger.
[00:59:58.761 --> 01:00:05.947]  I mean, he's over there like... He's like bending that steel bar like it's a pretzel.
[01:00:06.767 --> 01:00:08.169]  You go on over there and kick his ass.
[01:00:10.411 --> 01:00:11.932]  I mean, that's all this is.
[01:00:12.312 --> 01:00:13.133]  You ought to read the article.
[01:00:13.153 --> 01:00:14.354]  I mean, I'm not joking when I say that.
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:23.785]  They call him all these names, and they say, but don't worry, when we push him aside, he'll go.
[01:00:25.606 --> 01:00:31.812]  Or, like the Washington Post said a month ago, we'll arrest members of his cabinet who don't go along with our coup.
[01:00:32.012 --> 01:00:33.413]  And you just heard Oberman.
[01:00:33.934 --> 01:00:37.437]  He said, oh, we're going to arrest all his supporters, all the prominent ones.
[01:00:37.717 --> 01:00:42.141]  We're going to put the Supreme Court nominee in a prison cell.
[01:00:45.302 --> 01:00:52.224]  I mean, it's like Joseph Stalin or Adolf Hitler or Mao Tse Tung or Fidel Castro just got reborn.
[01:00:52.264 --> 01:00:56.705]  I mean, this isn't like, oh, they're showing authoritarian tendencies.
[01:00:59.286 --> 01:01:07.028]  This is like going to the Indy 500 and you see a race car and a driver and you go, I'm betting on that one.
[01:01:07.268 --> 01:01:09.868]  And then the last mile of the race, they take the pole position.
[01:01:10.149 --> 01:01:11.269]  I mean, it is the most...
[01:01:12.262 --> 01:01:17.483]  Naked authoritarianism I've ever seen anywhere.
[01:01:17.864 --> 01:01:21.785]  I mean, even Hitler and people didn't brag like this when they weren't in power.
[01:01:22.205 --> 01:01:25.146]  They kind of secretly did it later, once they were in power.
[01:01:30.327 --> 01:01:31.087]  These people are crazy.
[01:01:33.188 --> 01:01:33.788]  Really crazy.
[01:01:35.413 --> 01:01:39.197]  You see, they've got to keep all their moles and all their minions still in government.
[01:01:39.237 --> 01:01:43.601]  Like Comey said last year, oh stay in there, we're going to get rid of Trump, stay in there, don't leave.
[01:01:43.621 --> 01:01:49.586]  And that's all this is, because none of them have been held accountable, so why shouldn't they continue to do all this?
[01:01:50.384 --> 01:01:51.585]  And that's what's so dangerous about it.
[01:01:52.425 --> 01:01:54.347]  I don't care about retribution with these people.
[01:01:54.827 --> 01:01:56.709]  These people are soulless demons.
[01:01:56.969 --> 01:01:58.550]  They've got God to deal with.
[01:01:59.190 --> 01:02:00.811]  But the problem is they don't go away.
[01:02:01.492 --> 01:02:04.674]  They just stay there like undead zombies.
[01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:06.516]  Maybe I should read the article.
[01:02:10.058 --> 01:02:16.623]  Three weeks from now, we will reach an end to the speculation about what Donald Trump will do if he faces political defeat.
[01:02:17.875 --> 01:02:21.456]  Whether he will leave power like a normal president or attempt some wild resistance.
[01:02:22.356 --> 01:02:41.603]  Reality will intrude, substantially if not definitely, into an argument or whether the president is corrupt and incompetent who postures as a strong man on Twitter or a threat to the Republic to whom the words like authoritarianism and even autocrat can be reasonably applied.
[01:02:43.507 --> 01:02:46.834]  I've been on the first side of the argument since the early days of the presidency.
[01:02:47.174 --> 01:02:54.428]  And since we're nearing either an ending or some poll-defying reset, like last time, let me make the case one more time.
[01:02:55.387 --> 01:03:00.370]  Across the last four years, the Donald Trump administration has indeed displayed hallmarks of authoritarianism.
[01:03:01.351 --> 01:03:11.937]  It features egregious internal sycophantry and hacks in high positions, abusive presidential rhetoric, and bandacity on an unusual scale.
[01:03:12.437 --> 01:03:20.482]  The president's attempts to delegitimize the 2020 vote aren't novel, it goes on to say, but the coward will stand down.
[01:03:22.369 --> 01:03:23.370]  He will go away.
[01:03:24.210 --> 01:03:27.353]  He lacks power over the media, and it goes on.
[01:03:27.673 --> 01:03:29.134]  Even Fox News is against him.
[01:03:29.694 --> 01:03:34.037]  He lacks popularity and political skill, unlike other global strongmen.
[01:03:34.638 --> 01:03:35.458]  He's a coward.
[01:03:35.519 --> 01:03:36.259]  He's a fool.
[01:03:36.599 --> 01:03:38.521]  The CIA and FBI will take him out.
[01:03:38.541 --> 01:03:40.762]  I mean, you gotta go read this article.
[01:03:41.703 --> 01:03:47.287]  This is the most snot-nosed declaration of evil ever, other than Keith Olbermann saying they're gonna arrest everybody.
[01:03:48.788 --> 01:03:49.929]  But why is this so important?
[01:03:52.637 --> 01:04:07.122]  Well, the Wall Street Journal has an article, an American coup attempt, which actually lays out the real, on record, trying to overthrow the election, illegal spying, setting people up, putting innocent people in prison, what they really did.
[01:04:07.142 --> 01:04:10.503]  I mean, everything the Democrats say they are.
[01:04:14.245 --> 01:04:17.186]  Everything they say President Trump is, is what they are.
[01:04:19.235 --> 01:04:23.041]  And their God is a psychotic demon, Hillary Clinton.
[01:04:25.665 --> 01:04:26.726]  Now let me shift gears here.
[01:04:27.087 --> 01:04:29.551]  We're going to go to the final segment, and then I'm going to cover this.
[01:04:30.372 --> 01:04:33.376]  Trump is 22 days out, taking the gloves off.
[01:04:34.355 --> 01:04:39.197]  And he is excoriating members of his cabinet that are being cowards, and he's really hitting on all cylinders.
[01:04:39.217 --> 01:04:40.177]  We'll talk about when we come back.
[01:04:41.597 --> 01:04:43.498]  Separately, there's like 10 hours left.
[01:04:44.278 --> 01:04:48.760]  We want to get the highest quality storable foods out there at the lowest price and ready to ship within one week.
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:05:04.758]  With all this uncertainty and all the craziness going on and all the globalist activity, I would get a six-month, a year food supply of high-quality, swearable foods the last 25 years that are also Patriots, and then it also funds this operation.
[01:05:05.419 --> 01:05:08.402]  Nine hours, 17 minutes, 54 seconds left.
[01:05:10.779 --> 01:05:14.762]  To get the lowest price on the highest quality storable food on top of the lowest price.
[01:05:15.582 --> 01:05:20.605]  You haven't seen a sale in five years from my Patriot, but I got them to do it at preparewithalex.com.
[01:05:21.186 --> 01:05:22.286]  Preparewithalex.com.
[01:05:22.907 --> 01:05:23.927]  A one-year food supply.
[01:05:23.947 --> 01:05:25.428]  Already lowest price, highest quality.
[01:05:26.149 --> 01:05:26.829]  $600 off.
[01:05:27.570 --> 01:05:29.711]  A six-month, $300 off.
[01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:32.913]  A three-month, $160 off.
[01:05:33.293 --> 01:05:36.956]  And a bunch of other specials at preparewithalex.com.
[01:05:37.456 --> 01:05:39.958]  And when this sale is over,
[01:05:41.243 --> 01:05:55.647]  In the early morning hours of today, that is it, because they told me they can't do it anymore, because their other distributors are getting pissed off that I already have the lowest prices at InfoWareStore.com on their full catalog of food, and now I've got them to do this even lower price, which they think undercuts the market.
[01:05:55.987 --> 01:05:57.147]  I don't think it works like that.
[01:05:57.247 --> 01:06:01.569]  People tune into their shows, aren't tuning into mine, but they're a big sponsor out there for a lot of their big radio shows.
[01:06:01.949 --> 01:06:03.189]  We have the best price already.
[01:06:03.229 --> 01:06:05.370]  This is the best price on the best price.
[01:06:05.430 --> 01:06:06.610]  It ends in nine hours.
[01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:09.392]  At PrepareWithAlex.com.
[01:06:09.853 --> 01:06:12.076]  They put the PrepareWithAlex.com up there.
[01:06:12.196 --> 01:06:13.578]  I will also tell you the toll free number.
[01:06:14.653 --> 01:06:19.035]  You can call and have all of your questions answered and also get that food.
[01:06:19.055 --> 01:06:26.257]  But they have food ready to deliver to you right now at preparewithalex.com.
[01:06:26.317 --> 01:06:27.438]  Just throw the graphic back up, guys.
[01:06:27.458 --> 01:06:32.019]  The lower third, and it's got a lower third, a little toll-free number that is the specific number.
[01:06:32.039 --> 01:06:38.062]  You can always call my toll-free number to get the general food, but maybe we'll add it in post for folks.
[01:06:38.122 --> 01:06:41.643]  We're live right now, but it's just a preparewithalex.com graphic.
[01:06:42.808 --> 01:06:44.289]  And, uh, we put that up on the screen.
[01:06:44.829 --> 01:06:45.189]  There it is.
[01:06:45.209 --> 01:06:46.089]  888-411-0350.
[01:06:46.109 --> 01:06:46.329]  888-411-0350.
[01:06:46.349 --> 01:06:51.511]  We'll be right back.
[01:06:52.812 --> 01:06:54.273]  Let the good times roll.
[01:06:54.393 --> 01:06:58.534]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:06:59.295 --> 01:07:00.755]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:07:06.998 --> 01:07:07.758]  Let them wash.
[01:07:10.058 --> 01:07:20.109]  You know, when I'm being attacked, when I'm being lied about, only judge I've got is God.
[01:07:20.910 --> 01:07:23.192]  And almost always it's not even a real attack.
[01:07:24.153 --> 01:07:27.217]  So I just stay on target and just ignore the attacks.
[01:07:28.541 --> 01:07:34.383]  To the point of, the enemy cannot stand it, because you're my judge, as viewers and listeners, and you keep us on air.
[01:07:34.863 --> 01:07:44.667]  And I almost said this earlier, and then I got depressed reading another article, I didn't do it, about one African town of like 50,000 where 3,000 children starved to death last month.
[01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:48.128]  I mean, I can't be vitriolic.
[01:07:48.288 --> 01:07:50.769]  Hey, the UN admits they're murdering everybody!
[01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:54.410]  It's sick.
[01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:54.991]  It's sick.
[01:07:58.154 --> 01:08:00.276]  And it's going to come back on us unless we do something about it.
[01:08:01.517 --> 01:08:03.998]  I mean, I feel the spiritual danger of this.
[01:08:04.999 --> 01:08:06.080]  I'm not doing this as a hero.
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:07.501]  I'm doing this as survival.
[01:08:08.161 --> 01:08:09.302]  Physically and spiritually.
[01:08:09.803 --> 01:08:11.584]  It isn't heroic to stand up to this.
[01:08:11.824 --> 01:08:12.605]  You better do it.
[01:08:12.905 --> 01:08:14.006]  And I know you understand that.
[01:08:15.247 --> 01:08:16.568]  But, look at this.
[01:08:16.748 --> 01:08:18.990]  I mean, I've talked a lot about this because I just run into it.
[01:08:19.330 --> 01:08:27.016]  The UN runs the Operation Stopping Child Trafficking, and there's just thousands of articles of them caught all over the world, kidnapping kids, snuff filming them.
[01:08:27.276 --> 01:08:28.357]  I mean, the UN's the worst.
[01:08:29.578 --> 01:08:40.186]  The Sun newspaper reports Ghislaine Maxwell, the female pimp, she basically ran Epstein, pictured an anti-sex trafficking event,
[01:08:41.513 --> 01:08:45.236]  Before arrest for providing pedo-epstey with young girls.
[01:08:48.318 --> 01:08:55.903]  And when I started really exposing this five years ago, I was exposing it 20 years ago, but I got some visits by folks that have been involved actually taking these groups out.
[01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:57.764]  They said, listen, Jones, you got to be careful.
[01:08:57.784 --> 01:08:59.846]  A lot of the groups saying they're fighting and are running it.
[01:08:59.866 --> 01:09:06.250]  And then they exposed to me how the Amber Alert headlady changed her name and now runs it.
[01:09:06.290 --> 01:09:08.832]  But she got convicted of shipping kids out of Haiti.
[01:09:09.092 --> 01:09:11.174]  A bunch of them disappeared, some dead.
[01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:20.896]  So there she is, Ghislaine Maxwell, at the event for kidnapped children.
[01:09:21.296 --> 01:09:22.057]  This is sick.
[01:09:23.899 --> 01:09:24.479]  This is sick.
[01:09:24.499 --> 01:09:27.863]  And that ties into all this other news.
[01:09:28.363 --> 01:09:35.451]  FBI agent who found Wiener laptop with Clinton emails says FBI leadership ordered him to erase his findings.
[01:09:37.892 --> 01:09:43.835]  And we know that General Flynn and others, lawyers, have seen and talked to lawyers that have seen it and talked to the cops that saw it.
[01:09:43.895 --> 01:09:59.462]  I remember back four years ago during the campaign, four years ago plus, about four years and a month ago, about two months before the election, I was talking to people that were with the state police and stuff, man.
[01:10:00.362 --> 01:10:03.844]  Did you know that three of the five contacts are dead?
[01:10:04.825 --> 01:10:05.565]  And they're children!
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:10.164]  Oh, it's always a heroin overdose.
[01:10:14.549 --> 01:10:16.752]  Something like 10 of the 12 cops are dead.
[01:10:16.772 --> 01:10:18.694]  I mean, by the way, I'm not just up here saying that.
[01:10:18.895 --> 01:10:20.416]  Like, these are real people I talk to.
[01:10:20.657 --> 01:10:21.378]  They're dead!
[01:10:25.762 --> 01:10:27.083]  People ask, why are you still on air?
[01:10:27.123 --> 01:10:29.725]  It's like Jim Garrison, the DA in New Orleans.
[01:10:30.106 --> 01:10:32.528]  Famously told the media, he said, I stay in the spotlight.
[01:10:32.588 --> 01:10:33.248]  I'm prominent.
[01:10:33.569 --> 01:10:34.629]  It's the only reason I'm alive.
[01:10:34.930 --> 01:10:36.831]  Wolves don't come into the flame, the fire.
[01:10:37.091 --> 01:10:39.093]  They get you when you're out taking a piss in the woods.
[01:10:40.434 --> 01:10:41.555]  That's when the tiger gets you.
[01:10:41.575 --> 01:10:42.616]  That's when the bear gets you.
[01:10:42.636 --> 01:10:43.717]  That's when the wolf gets you.
[01:10:43.737 --> 01:10:46.900]  It's when you're out there at night, away from the fire.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.301]  The light keeps you safe.
[01:10:50.117 --> 01:10:51.277]  I'm riding around to the lights right now.
[01:10:51.618 --> 01:10:52.998]  I just prayed to Jesus to keep me safe.
[01:10:53.258 --> 01:10:54.599]  But if they want to take me, I'm not scared.
[01:10:54.859 --> 01:10:56.300]  And they hate the fact that I'm not scared.
[01:10:56.580 --> 01:10:57.820]  I don't say it that tough to people.
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:00.881]  It's not, that's not, no, that, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:11:00.901 --> 01:11:02.882]  It's not, oh no, you can do that too.
[01:11:03.322 --> 01:11:06.104]  Trust in Jesus and stop carrying that with your body.
[01:11:06.504 --> 01:11:07.504]  You're going to die anyways.
[01:11:08.344 --> 01:11:10.185]  And like dying, just like falling off a bicycle.
[01:11:11.066 --> 01:11:13.106]  And you hit the ground, you're dead, you're with God.
[01:11:13.807 --> 01:11:14.647]  It's not big, folks.
[01:11:15.727 --> 01:11:16.608]  As soon as you die,
[01:11:18.234 --> 01:11:19.315]  You're gonna laugh at this later.
[01:11:19.335 --> 01:11:20.595]  You're gonna have eternity.
[01:11:20.875 --> 01:11:21.976]  Time's not gonna matter anymore.
[01:11:24.257 --> 01:11:24.758]  Think about that.
[01:11:25.398 --> 01:11:26.899]  Stop giving Satan power.
[01:11:27.539 --> 01:11:28.259]  Stop caring.
[01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:29.560]  Don't commit suicide.
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:30.521]  Your life is precious.
[01:11:30.881 --> 01:11:31.841]  Stay here and do good work.
[01:11:32.522 --> 01:11:33.522]  Your life belongs to God.
[01:11:34.243 --> 01:11:35.964]  But stop caring if you die.
[01:11:35.984 --> 01:11:37.825]  See, I'm the opposite of suicidal.
[01:11:37.925 --> 01:11:38.965]  I love my life.
[01:11:39.465 --> 01:11:42.987]  I love beer and food and my family and everything.
[01:11:43.067 --> 01:11:43.968]  I love life.
[01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:45.889]  I love it so much that I'll give it up right now.
[01:11:47.486 --> 01:11:51.187]  Because I won't sell one person out for Satan.
[01:11:52.047 --> 01:11:58.409]  I won't sell one person out for another hundred years of life, another thousand years of life, because it's a scam!
[01:11:58.669 --> 01:11:59.509]  It's a lie!
[01:11:59.749 --> 01:12:01.289]  I was already given eternal life.
[01:12:01.929 --> 01:12:11.352]  I was already created and put on this planet in a test by the Supreme Being, and I have that connection, and I know that, and I choose that, and I am above Satan.
[01:12:11.972 --> 01:12:12.852]  Get behind me, Satan.
[01:12:16.613 --> 01:12:18.674]  But let's hit some of the positive news right now.
[01:12:19.294 --> 01:12:23.735]  Trump urges Attorney General Barr to indict Obama, Biden and Hillary.
[01:12:24.696 --> 01:12:29.237]  You notice Barr, Trump said this Thursday, Barr came out Friday and said, we will not before the election.
[01:12:30.237 --> 01:12:31.098]  He's a swamp creature.
[01:12:31.578 --> 01:12:33.939]  He doesn't want a war.
[01:12:34.119 --> 01:12:35.039]  There's already a war.
[01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:36.540]  I don't think Barr's bad.
[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:38.480]  He just thinks Trump is too aggressive.
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.921]  No, this is what we elected.
[01:12:40.181 --> 01:12:40.901]  This is what we want.
[01:12:43.479 --> 01:12:46.000]  Trump chewed into Pompeo, said release emails.
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:47.480]  They released like half of them yesterday.
[01:12:47.820 --> 01:12:48.620]  No media coverage.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:49.780]  We've been plowing through them.
[01:12:49.801 --> 01:12:51.521]  There's tens of thousands of them.
[01:12:52.821 --> 01:12:55.042]  Trump tells Iran, go ahead and attack somebody.
[01:12:55.062 --> 01:12:55.782]  We'll F you up.
[01:12:56.402 --> 01:12:58.563]  He said that because no president ever used that language.
[01:12:58.763 --> 01:12:59.803]  He wants them to know he's serious.
[01:13:00.083 --> 01:13:01.303]  Let's play a few of those clubs right now.
[01:13:03.444 --> 01:13:03.684]  Right.
[01:13:03.744 --> 01:13:05.744]  And Iran knows that and they've been put on notice.
[01:13:05.784 --> 01:13:12.846]  If you f*** around with us, if you do something bad to us, we are going to do things to you that have never been done before.
[01:13:14.176 --> 01:13:18.640]  They're in the State Department, but Mike Pompeo has been unable to get them out, which is very sad.
[01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:22.443]  Actually, I'm not happy about him for that reason.
[01:13:22.483 --> 01:13:23.504]  He was unable to get them out.
[01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:24.004]  I don't know why.
[01:13:24.044 --> 01:13:25.645]  You're running the State Department, you get them out.
[01:13:25.666 --> 01:13:27.527]  Forget about the fact that they were classified.
[01:13:27.947 --> 01:13:28.368]  Let's go.
[01:13:28.848 --> 01:13:31.090]  Maybe Mike Pompeo finally finds them, okay?
[01:13:33.092 --> 01:13:34.813]  So notice, Trump is doing what you gotta do.
[01:13:34.833 --> 01:13:35.874]  He's on the warpath.
[01:13:36.414 --> 01:13:38.296]  He's done with 20-something days out.
[01:13:38.316 --> 01:13:39.096]  He's on the attack.
[01:13:39.397 --> 01:13:41.879]  We should all be on the attack peacefully, but with the truth.
[01:13:43.362 --> 01:13:56.208]  And stop letting leftists waddle up and dictate to us that we're racist or we're bad when they're the ones supporting Chinese death camps for Muslims, Christians, and Buddhists, and when they're the ones that support pedophilia.
[01:13:56.728 --> 01:13:58.509]  Stop being afraid of the left.
[01:13:59.129 --> 01:14:04.331]  Stop being afraid of their bad housekeeping seal of approval.
[01:14:05.692 --> 01:14:09.574]  If you don't have the devil and the world and the left after you,
[01:14:10.879 --> 01:14:13.921]  I can tell you right now, like the Bible says, God's gonna say, I don't know you.
[01:14:14.421 --> 01:14:15.442]  What does Christ say?
[01:14:15.862 --> 01:14:20.265]  He who is with me is against he who has control of the world.
[01:14:20.565 --> 01:14:25.588]  You will be persecuted in my name, but you will be blessed.
[01:14:26.789 --> 01:14:34.774]  But you first must be persecuted, and those that are steadfast will be given eternal life.
[01:14:36.681 --> 01:14:44.509]  I mean, you don't think all of our souls, all of our bandwidth, all of who we are, is gonna get life with God.
[01:14:45.630 --> 01:14:49.293]  We're not gonna get like a song catalog.
[01:14:49.313 --> 01:14:52.476]  You don't think God's gonna keep us, unless we're a good song.
[01:14:53.397 --> 01:14:57.882]  And listen, don't worry, those of you that don't want God, you get eternal life too.
[01:14:59.175 --> 01:15:00.676]  You get to spend your time with each other.
[01:15:01.917 --> 01:15:03.298]  I mean, that sounds like hell to me.
[01:15:03.819 --> 01:15:10.064]  You get to go to your SJW parasite palace, and you get to be with each other forever.
[01:15:10.664 --> 01:15:12.986]  Listen, Newtonian physics, show it.
[01:15:14.027 --> 01:15:15.508]  Einsteinian physics, show it.
[01:15:15.908 --> 01:15:17.250]  Max Planck's physics, show it.
[01:15:19.631 --> 01:15:20.852]  Quantum mechanics, show it.
[01:15:21.813 --> 01:15:23.915]  And nobody that's a top mathematician doesn't believe in God.
[01:15:23.935 --> 01:15:25.236]  They all go, oh my God, this is God.
[01:15:27.827 --> 01:15:29.008]  And you gotta come to grips with that.
[01:15:29.028 --> 01:15:29.528]  God's real.
[01:15:31.309 --> 01:15:37.812]  And you gotta decide which side you're on because people that serve evil are crazy.
[01:15:39.022 --> 01:15:49.228]  They are going against God and God's math because they want to be God instead of you're part of what God expressed and that's your place in the universe.
[01:15:49.668 --> 01:16:02.296]  These idiots go, no, men are women and women are men and we're going to overturn everything and we're going to make a giant 5,000 foot red tree that stinks horribly to quote Time Bandits.
[01:16:02.316 --> 01:16:08.460]  And you're like, well, why wasn't there a 5,000 foot tree that stunk horribly?
[01:16:09.755 --> 01:16:10.855]  Because there's no point in it.
[01:16:11.335 --> 01:16:13.796]  It's like, why do we have thousands of species of parrots?
[01:16:14.476 --> 01:16:16.497]  Let's have laser beams day one.
[01:16:16.797 --> 01:16:18.197]  That's not how God operates.
[01:16:18.577 --> 01:16:20.178]  You don't get laser beams day one.
[01:16:21.798 --> 01:16:31.381]  You've got to first prove that you know how to put your socks on, your boots on, and build something big and strong and good that helps others.
[01:16:32.241 --> 01:16:33.342]  You have to be godly.
[01:16:34.142 --> 01:16:34.762]  You have to build.
[01:16:35.182 --> 01:16:37.843]  You can't be given the keys of the universe for no reason.
[01:16:39.485 --> 01:16:40.185]  I'm out of time.
[01:16:40.366 --> 01:16:41.926]  I really appreciate the crew coming in tonight.
[01:16:42.227 --> 01:16:54.014]  It's such a big victory that the head UN envoy of the COVID Global Task Force came out and said the lockdown's killing people and needs to stop and that the economic shutdown is going to murder tons of people.
[01:16:54.334 --> 01:16:57.956]  Whether it's to cover his butt or whether the guy has a soul, whatever it is, it's the truth.
[01:16:57.976 --> 01:16:59.597]  And it's a big devastating victory.
[01:16:59.617 --> 01:17:05.561]  So next time you see a libtard wearing a mask or bossing you around how holy they are, you can shove this up their globalist keister.
[01:17:06.702 --> 01:17:09.284]  Uh, but listen, I appreciate you all coming up.
[01:17:09.444 --> 01:17:12.968]  Owen Schroer and the rest of the A-Team have got Sunday Live.
[01:17:13.008 --> 01:17:17.352]  It's basically commercial-free, and it's coming up with your calls and a lot more.
[01:17:17.592 --> 01:17:20.115]  So spread those links and be part of the resistance.
[01:17:20.535 --> 01:17:25.621]  Band.video, 2020ElectionCenter.com, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Summit.News.
[01:17:27.093 --> 01:17:30.094]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[01:17:30.114 --> 01:17:31.614]  They're going to contest the election.
[01:17:31.634 --> 01:17:33.074]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[01:17:33.394 --> 01:17:34.775]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[01:17:34.875 --> 01:17:35.875]  I want them shut down.
[01:17:35.955 --> 01:17:36.835]  I want them silenced.
[01:17:36.915 --> 01:17:37.575]  I want them muted.
[01:17:37.615 --> 01:17:39.536]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:17:39.576 --> 01:17:40.496]  You kept us on air.
[01:17:40.616 --> 01:17:41.916]  We did the analysis first.
[01:17:42.197 --> 01:17:43.197]  It's now gone mainstream.
[01:17:43.257 --> 01:17:45.237]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[01:17:45.337 --> 01:17:51.199]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[01:17:51.459 --> 01:17:52.899]  And you need to stop right now.
[01:17:52.999 --> 01:17:54.039]  And they're very, very serious.
[01:17:54.199 --> 01:17:56.800]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[01:17:56.800 --> 01:17:59.381]  It's not gonna happen, so they are moving now to destroy me.
[01:17:59.401 --> 01:18:04.044]  I used to say, support InfoWars, rescue InfoWars, save yourself, save the world.
[01:18:04.384 --> 01:18:05.244]  We're in this together.
[01:18:05.565 --> 01:18:13.348]  Because let me tell you something, communism's up here, InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting, and you and I are all down here with our families.
[01:18:13.549 --> 01:18:15.109]  My children are right here!
[01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:17.531]  But I need money to fight a war!
[01:18:17.571 --> 01:18:18.831]  And I need word of mouth!
[01:18:19.051 --> 01:18:19.932]  And I need prayer!
[01:18:20.092 --> 01:18:21.052]  And I need action!
[01:18:21.433 --> 01:18:23.013]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[01:18:23.734 --> 01:18:25.675]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[01:18:29.827 --> 01:18:31.348]  Hey, you there.
[01:18:31.808 --> 01:18:33.730]  The battle for the Republic is on.
[01:18:34.170 --> 01:18:37.652]  The American Revolution 2.0 is happening right now.
[01:18:38.032 --> 01:18:43.176]  But the corrupt establishment doesn't want you to know, and they certainly don't want you to get involved.
[01:18:43.536 --> 01:18:46.238]  But you can at Banned.Video.
[01:18:46.438 --> 01:18:49.420]  The truth lives at Banned.Video.
[01:18:49.620 --> 01:18:54.043]  The information they don't want you to see is at Banned.Video.
[01:18:54.483 --> 01:18:55.624]  This is your destiny.
[01:18:55.984 --> 01:18:58.426]  This is the epic battle for the future of humanity.
[01:18:58.867 --> 01:19:01.673]  America will survive as long as you fight.
[01:19:02.575 --> 01:19:03.037]  I've gotta go.
[01:19:26.403 --> 01:19:32.751]  I've talked to the EMS and I've talked to medical doctors, and what makes you nauseated is not just the smell of piss, but what we call the smell of lung piss.
[01:19:32.771 --> 01:19:34.193]  It has this sweet nauseating smell.
[01:19:34.213 --> 01:19:35.234]  It's on your face.
[01:19:35.315 --> 01:19:37.417]  All it does, it's a sweet stench.
[01:19:37.557 --> 01:19:39.961]  It's like you want to throw up like rotten meat.
[01:19:40.041 --> 01:19:41.703]  It is the crap of dust mites.
[01:19:42.023 --> 01:19:46.186]  Have you noticed the stench of bum piss in your leftist-run neighborhoods?
[01:19:46.546 --> 01:19:53.090]  The crap of dust mites in bum piss is a real thing, and InfoWars Store has the solution.
[01:19:53.310 --> 01:20:05.738]  InfoWars has created the most powerful herbal lung cleanse and respiratory support product on the market, with over a thousand types of mold and mildew, toxic chemicals, and yes, dust mites.
[01:20:06.178 --> 01:20:19.554]  Our Lung Cleanse Plus, made with organic and wild cultivated herbs, is just what you need to survive the unprecedented surge of bum piss and other toxic substances in liberal leftist cities everywhere.
[01:20:19.855 --> 01:20:24.781]  Order the Infowars Life Lung Cleanse Plus supplement today at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:20:26.505 --> 01:20:31.109]  We need to get back to the land, back to self-sufficiency, and back to being prepared.
[01:20:31.389 --> 01:20:39.916]  And the way to start, ladies and gentlemen, is having friends and family with a bug-out plan if there is a total collapse, and water filtration, and food to last you at least a few months.
[01:20:40.556 --> 01:20:42.798]  And the food we have is very high quality.
[01:20:43.078 --> 01:20:45.439]  It's in great containers that are great to be mobile.
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:48.121]  They have wide selection, special diets, you name it.
[01:20:48.361 --> 01:20:49.942]  It's the best price you're going to find.
[01:20:50.062 --> 01:20:53.644]  But you need to get the orders in now, in the lull before the storm.
[01:20:53.964 --> 01:20:55.605]  I told you lockdown 2 was coming.
[01:20:55.765 --> 01:20:57.506]  The New World Order is making its move.
[01:20:57.686 --> 01:21:01.208]  Whether Trump loses or wins, things are just going to get more crazy.
[01:21:01.508 --> 01:21:04.550]  And this food lasts 25 years inside the containers.
[01:21:04.910 --> 01:21:16.856]  So it's something you can hide, something you can bury, something you know is an ace in the hole for you and your family in the future, and the little bit of profit that comes in funds the InfoWar to continue to warn the people.
[01:21:16.876 --> 01:21:23.099]  So you're also funding InfoWars, the most powerful Paul Revere organization in the world, and it's powered by you.
