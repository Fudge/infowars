[00:00:02.037 --> 00:00:03.737]  Big Brother.
[00:00:03.737 --> 00:00:06.058]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:07.818]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:07.818 --> 00:00:09.919]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:12.059]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:20.261]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:20.261 --> 00:00:22.782]  22 days out from the election, my friends.
[00:00:22.782 --> 00:00:25.943]  And of course, the Democrats are going to contest it.
[00:00:25.943 --> 00:00:28.803]  The inauguration is 100 days out.
[00:00:28.803 --> 00:00:30.364]  That's the real number to look at.
[00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:55.387]  Because Pelosi says, out of the 20th Amendment, they are intending to hold up the inauguration so that the President then does not get installed by the voters, but then the Democrat House will then vote on who becomes the President, and or they have other procedures where they can go to the states and have them vote and do it.
[00:00:55.387 --> 00:00:58.429]  It's going to be a fiasco of biblical
[00:00:59.363 --> 00:01:02.064]  Biblical proportions and that's their plan.
[00:01:02.064 --> 00:01:03.304]  That's what they're pushing for.
[00:01:03.304 --> 00:01:06.886]  But let's get into it right now.
[00:01:06.886 --> 00:01:12.348]  I got up here about two and a half hours ago and already been getting prepared for a day and a half of this Sunday show.
[00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:17.066]  And I was going through the Gateway Pundit stack of articles.
[00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:19.466]  They had me print all the Gateway Pundit articles.
[00:01:19.466 --> 00:01:23.507]  And I just reeled back, because I recognized the name.
[00:01:23.507 --> 00:01:29.309]  It's the main global envoy, or the voice of the UN, on the COVID-19 response.
[00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:32.309]  He's in line to be the head of the WHO next.
[00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:36.490]  And he came out and said, we've got to end the lockdowns and end the COVID-19 responses.
[00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.631]  It's causing way more death than it's saving.
[00:01:38.631 --> 00:01:39.251]  This is insane.
[00:01:41.269 --> 00:01:47.331]  So, you hear the record skip, you hear the car crash noise right there.
[00:01:47.331 --> 00:01:56.295]  It was the UN back in December of last year said, hey, vaccines are killing people, they're untested, we need to pause vaccines, the public doesn't believe in them, the doctors don't believe in them.
[00:01:56.295 --> 00:01:59.896]  But they said, but we're just giving them by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told what to do.
[00:01:59.896 --> 00:02:02.657]  So even the UN, the global government system itself,
[00:02:04.127 --> 00:02:05.427]  It's just a puppet.
[00:02:05.427 --> 00:02:08.348]  And what they say is God.
[00:02:08.348 --> 00:02:14.589]  When they say it, Big Tech says, that's policy, that's the end of it, you're not allowed to go against that even if you're a medical doctor.
[00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:25.732]  They say you don't need vitamin D, then you can't say as a medical doctor you need vitamin D. They say you don't need vitamin C, the FBI will SWAT team you.
[00:02:25.732 --> 00:02:30.693]  But now Fauci say you need to say, oh wait, okay, we'll drop the charges, Fauci's God.
[00:02:30.693 --> 00:02:33.454]  So Fauci's God, Bill Gates is God, the UN's God,
[00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:36.302]  None of us have any rights.
[00:02:36.302 --> 00:02:45.686]  But now even the UN's head envoy for global COVID-19 response comes out, cover next segment, and says, we've got to stop this.
[00:02:45.686 --> 00:02:48.187]  This is causing millions to die already.
[00:02:48.187 --> 00:02:50.208]  Hundreds of millions are going to die.
[00:02:50.208 --> 00:02:51.668]  Well, what do you think the plan is?
[00:02:51.668 --> 00:02:55.570]  But see, I don't want to judge this individual, but he's up at this high level.
[00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:56.650]  I looked at his pedigree.
[00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:57.731]  It's pretty, pretty globalist.
[00:02:58.951 --> 00:03:00.172]  Obviously.
[00:03:00.172 --> 00:03:04.396]  But even some of these people get to a moment of truth and wake up finally.
[00:03:04.396 --> 00:03:08.940]  But regardless, the horse already left the barn.
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.462]  Cow's already left the barn.
[00:03:10.462 --> 00:03:11.423]  Genie's already out of the bottle.
[00:03:12.932 --> 00:03:14.713]  Train already left the station.
[00:03:14.713 --> 00:03:20.055]  And it's already going to be devastating, de-de-de-de-devastating to our economy.
[00:03:20.055 --> 00:03:22.496]  It's going to put millions of people out of work.
[00:03:22.496 --> 00:03:24.937]  It's going to bankrupt tens of millions in the Western world.
[00:03:24.937 --> 00:03:27.299]  But the third world, it's already a death sentence.
[00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:28.539]  Millions are already dead.
[00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:36.563]  And I want the left and the Democrats and Fauci and Gates to know, we know they're behind it.
[00:03:36.563 --> 00:03:38.664]  So they can be discredited and exposed for
[00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:41.740]  The progenitors of the Nazis.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.341]  They're not sons of the Nazis.
[00:03:43.341 --> 00:03:45.102]  They're not neo-Nazis.
[00:03:45.102 --> 00:03:46.263]  They're not Nazis.
[00:03:46.263 --> 00:03:51.887]  They're the eugenics global scientific control freak cult that the Nazis were just a spinoff of.
[00:03:51.887 --> 00:03:55.070]  But the Nazis wanted to make it based around Aryan white people.
[00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.132]  The globalists want to kill everybody.
[00:03:58.132 --> 00:04:02.095]  In fact, they don't like people that they see as elitist or high IQ.
[00:04:02.095 --> 00:04:04.837]  So it's even more aggressive than the Nazis.
[00:04:04.837 --> 00:04:05.638]  If that's possible.
[00:04:06.351 --> 00:04:11.477]  So, truly sick, true elitism, we have this massive info.
[00:04:11.477 --> 00:04:15.141]  We're going to break it all down when we come back.
[00:04:15.141 --> 00:04:26.473]  And then the election, and then the ongoing COVID lockdowns, and then Keith Olbermann saying arrest Trump as a terrorist, arrest all his supporters, destroy us, put us in gulags.
[00:04:26.473 --> 00:04:27.695]  I mean, you talk about a crazy
[00:04:29.321 --> 00:04:30.982]  And you've got the New York Times calling for the U.N.
[00:04:30.982 --> 00:04:32.142]  to take over the U.S.
[00:04:32.142 --> 00:04:33.323]  More articles out on that.
[00:04:33.323 --> 00:04:41.467]  And you've got a left-wing Antifa security guard shooting an unarmed man to death in Denver at a demonstration at a Patriot prayer group.
[00:04:41.467 --> 00:04:42.867]  The media trying to cover that up.
[00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:45.889]  And those guys were going to kidnap the Michigan governor.
[00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:49.630]  It's now confirmed they're all Antifa and BLM.
[00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.791]  Not just a few of them.
[00:04:50.791 --> 00:04:53.972]  There are a bunch of leftist, libtard terrorists.
[00:04:53.972 --> 00:04:54.533]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:06.475]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much less in the entire world.
[00:05:06.475 --> 00:05:12.521]  InfoWars is standalone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks at hundreds of stations picking us up.
[00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:22.951]  Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense, and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda.
[00:05:23.732 --> 00:05:27.973]  That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at Band.Video.
[00:05:27.973 --> 00:05:32.414]  They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook.
[00:05:32.414 --> 00:05:47.737]  That's why it's so precious, because if censorship expands to everyone, which it is now, with AI monitoring and controlling what you can say and do, it's going to be the OACs like Band.Video and the now redesigned InfoWars.com that become more and more important, which they are.
[00:05:48.177 --> 00:05:56.191]  And the enemy is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now.
[00:05:56.191 --> 00:05:57.654]  They're coming after everyone.
[00:05:57.654 --> 00:05:58.595]  So spread the word now.
[00:06:18.795 --> 00:06:22.099]  22 days to the election.
[00:06:22.099 --> 00:06:31.313]  But that date is now not important because the Democrats that each state have set on record, they're going to challenge the whole thing.
[00:06:31.313 --> 00:06:32.214]  And so we are 100 days out.
[00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:38.171]  After Election Day will be 79 days out.
[00:06:38.171 --> 00:06:40.112]  The 79 days of hell.
[00:06:40.112 --> 00:06:44.475]  The attempts to break up this country and bring us down and put us under world government.
[00:06:44.475 --> 00:06:46.536]  It's all been announced.
[00:06:46.536 --> 00:06:50.238]  More articles in the Boston Globe, the LA Times, you name it.
[00:06:50.238 --> 00:06:54.840]  Agreeing with the New York Times that the UN should come in and oversee our elections.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.402]  That we should be put under world government.
[00:06:57.402 --> 00:07:00.523]  It's simply amazing to be living during this time.
[00:07:00.523 --> 00:07:01.344]  That's all coming up.
[00:07:03.939 --> 00:07:19.031]  Meanwhile, this is not a joke, the Major Mathematic Association of the United States says 2 plus 2 is racist, 2 plus 2 equals 4 is racist, and that mathematics is white and bad and is not real.
[00:07:19.031 --> 00:07:27.398]  So we've now officially, I'm not joking, entered 1984 where Winston's being tortured and he says the ability to say 2 plus 2 equals 4 is freedom.
[00:07:27.398 --> 00:07:30.941]  By the end of it, O'Brien tortures him so bad he believes it's whatever number O'Brien says.
[00:07:31.724 --> 00:07:39.351]  Math Association says math inherently carries human bias, citing critical race theory.
[00:07:39.351 --> 00:07:44.275]  Also, Ghislaine Maxwell, as we find out, attended anti-human trafficking summits.
[00:07:44.275 --> 00:07:46.637]  Well, of course she did.
[00:07:46.637 --> 00:07:54.083]  The head of the Amber Alert system that gives them the database was convicted of child trafficking and changed her name.
[00:07:54.083 --> 00:07:56.786]  I mean, who do you think these people are?
[00:07:56.786 --> 00:07:58.127]  They're in command.
[00:07:59.528 --> 00:08:08.656]  And there's no place you want to be when you're running this stuff better than in the position of tracking children and others that are missing.
[00:08:08.656 --> 00:08:10.918]  That's all coming up.
[00:08:10.918 --> 00:08:17.744]  And the left is so mad that Trump's got a huge bust of child trafficking, child rape, child murder, snuff films.
[00:08:17.744 --> 00:08:22.027]  I've got a stack of news where they're just busting them all over the U.S., all over the world.
[00:08:22.027 --> 00:08:27.032]  And the desperate leftist media just gets more and more scared because their religion is pedophilia.
[00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:33.762]  They took over every major institution, not just the Catholic Church, not just Penn State.
[00:08:33.762 --> 00:08:34.743]  But we're learning everything.
[00:08:34.743 --> 00:08:38.125]  That's all coming up as well.
[00:08:38.125 --> 00:08:43.829]  And we also have a left-wing security guard charged with first-degree murder in Denver, shooting a Trump supporter.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.941]  The media tried to spin it.
[00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:56.843]  First said it was a right-winger who killed somebody, then they had to admit that it was an Antifa supporter who worked for local Channel 9 who had bragged about how he was going to get right-wingers.
[00:08:56.843 --> 00:09:00.684]  And he executed a guy shooting him in the head at point-blank range.
[00:09:00.684 --> 00:09:06.225]  It's a very powerful report at Band.Video and Infowars.com by John Baum.
[00:09:06.225 --> 00:09:08.146]  Execution by liberal media in Denver.
[00:09:08.146 --> 00:09:12.307]  So it's not just Antifa or BLM that stalks
[00:09:13.356 --> 00:09:17.078]  Patriot Prayer Group meetings in Portland or in Denver.
[00:09:17.078 --> 00:09:20.281]  It's now Channel 9.
[00:09:20.281 --> 00:09:42.015]  They have a Black Lives Matter provocateur with a shirt saying Black Guns Matter screaming and starting a fight over and over again with a security guard and with somebody else and trying to start a fight and then finally he runs off and the security guard shoots the white guy dead in the head.
[00:09:44.833 --> 00:09:46.214]  So that's all coming up.
[00:09:46.214 --> 00:09:47.514]  I don't know if we should show these videos.
[00:09:47.514 --> 00:09:48.235]  We probably will.
[00:09:48.235 --> 00:09:50.196]  They're all up on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:50.196 --> 00:09:52.097]  They're up on NewsWars.com.
[00:09:52.097 --> 00:09:56.559]  But yes, later, parental discretion advised, we will show this on air.
[00:09:56.559 --> 00:10:00.081]  But there you go.
[00:10:00.081 --> 00:10:02.723]  This is what they've turned us into.
[00:10:02.723 --> 00:10:06.285]  Okay.
[00:10:06.285 --> 00:10:06.805]  Let me do this.
[00:10:11.837 --> 00:10:19.881]  Let me get to Keith Olbermann first, and the climate the left's put out, and then all the different media outlets calling for a coup against President Trump.
[00:10:19.881 --> 00:10:24.404]  And not just a coup, but his supporters need to be destroyed, and need to be put in prisons as well.
[00:10:24.404 --> 00:10:29.186]  That censoring us off of the internet isn't enough.
[00:10:29.186 --> 00:10:36.470]  Now we need to be hunted down, and we need to be... we need to be killed.
[00:10:38.326 --> 00:10:41.328]  Trump can be and must be expunged.
[00:11:08.058 --> 00:11:14.922]  The hate he has triggered, the Pandora's box he has opened, they will not be so easily destroyed.
[00:11:14.922 --> 00:11:17.483]  So, let us brace ourselves.
[00:11:17.483 --> 00:11:19.164]  The task is twofold.
[00:11:19.164 --> 00:11:24.607]  The terrorist Trump must be defeated, must be destroyed, must be devoured at the ballot box.
[00:11:24.607 --> 00:11:36.794]  And then he, and his enablers, and his supporters, and his collaborators, and the Mike Lees, and the William Bars, and the Sean Hannity's, and the Mike Pence's, and the Rudy Giuliani's, and the Kyle Rittenhouse's,
[00:11:37.014 --> 00:11:50.886]  And the Amy Coney Barrett's must be prosecuted and convicted and removed from our society while we try to rebuild it and to rebuild the world Trump has nearly destroyed by turning it over to a virus.
[00:11:52.065 --> 00:11:59.808]  Remember it, even as we dream of a return to reality and safety and the country for which our forefathers died.
[00:11:59.808 --> 00:12:12.892]  That the fight is not just to win an election, but to win it by enough to chase, at least for a moment, Trump and the maggots off the stage and then try to clean up what they left.
[00:12:12.892 --> 00:12:18.174]  Remember it, even though to remember it means remembering that the fight does not end November 3rd.
[00:12:19.261 --> 00:12:24.264]  But in many ways, we'll only begin that day.
[00:12:24.264 --> 00:12:34.431]  So, once they win the election, they think they're going to persecute us and put federal judges in prison and attack us because we're bad.
[00:12:34.431 --> 00:12:36.012]  This is what the universities have bred.
[00:12:36.012 --> 00:12:39.754]  Big money, big banks, the Communist Chinese.
[00:12:39.754 --> 00:12:40.875]  They want authoritarianism.
[00:12:42.346 --> 00:12:45.287]  And the whole world is run by these big corporations now.
[00:12:45.287 --> 00:12:48.007]  They look at America and think, well, we've already owned their debt.
[00:12:48.007 --> 00:12:50.708]  We already basically have control of their country.
[00:12:50.708 --> 00:12:52.388]  We control their media.
[00:12:52.388 --> 00:13:08.192]  So we can certainly now waltz in and have people say to them, we're going to arrest you.
[00:13:08.192 --> 00:13:10.153]  We're going to dominate you.
[00:13:10.153 --> 00:13:11.053]  We're going to destroy you.
[00:13:12.677 --> 00:13:15.390]  And that's just the way it is.
[00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:16.978]  But what's frustrating about that is...
[00:13:18.254 --> 00:13:23.137]  When you look at the left and the big corporations they work for, they're posing as if they're these underdogs.
[00:13:23.137 --> 00:13:26.359]  They're posing as if they're these little nobodies with no power.
[00:13:26.359 --> 00:13:45.172]  They've got the whole media behind them, the big banks behind them, all the big corporations behind them, all these foreign authoritarian governments, the communist Chinese, the EU, radical Islam behind them, all this power that doesn't like the fact that Americans still have a big middle class, or that America is one of the few countries where we can own guns and defend ourselves.
[00:13:46.155 --> 00:13:51.852]  And then meanwhile, all of the big tech companies, but particularly Apple, and particularly...
[00:13:52.935 --> 00:13:59.577]  Google are getting components from slave camps with Christians, Buddhists, and Muslims in them.
[00:13:59.577 --> 00:14:00.858]  They keep them segregated.
[00:14:00.858 --> 00:14:04.159]  Three million Muslims, a million Christians, a million Buddhists.
[00:14:04.159 --> 00:14:18.784]  They admit, they harvest their organs, they kill them for their religious beliefs, and the left sits there and celebrates it, and thinks it's funny, and thinks it's cute, and then tells us how President Trump, who didn't want one-sided trade deals with the Communist Chinese,
[00:14:20.356 --> 00:14:28.240]  And who doesn't like the human rights abuses, and who speaks out against it, that he's the bad guy.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:32.683]  And they shake their fingers at us and tell us that we're Hitler.
[00:14:32.683 --> 00:14:44.729]  When it's Trump trying to end the global lockdown, and it's Trump trying to point out that COVID-19 is way overblown and kills less than the flu on average, and they're counting flu deaths and pneumonia deaths in the COVID column.
[00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:51.472]  That only super obese, super sick people are dying from this.
[00:14:51.472 --> 00:14:58.756]  And the idea that they can protect you from it is impossible.
[00:14:58.756 --> 00:15:00.036]  The left isn't the left.
[00:15:00.036 --> 00:15:01.057]  They're not liberals.
[00:15:01.057 --> 00:15:06.099]  They're just people that echo what these global corporate systems say.
[00:15:07.574 --> 00:15:10.697]  So there's the big headline up on InfoWars.com.
[00:15:10.697 --> 00:15:12.599]  Global bombshell!
[00:15:12.599 --> 00:15:16.803]  UN says COVID restrictions and lockdowns are killing millions.
[00:15:16.803 --> 00:15:18.946]  Must stop!
[00:15:18.946 --> 00:15:22.789]  And I'll show you the evidence of that and the head UN envoy saying it.
[00:15:23.786 --> 00:15:26.388]  When we come back, this is really a big deal.
[00:15:26.388 --> 00:15:28.410]  And National File did a story about this as well.
[00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:30.011]  This is breaking all over the place.
[00:15:30.011 --> 00:15:41.261]  World Bank, UN, Harvard, think tanks, all warn COVID-19 lockdowns response leading to global starvation, food disruptions, 2 million already dead.
[00:15:43.117 --> 00:15:47.539]  Not even a million are dead from COVID worldwide, but two million dead from the lockdowns.
[00:15:47.539 --> 00:15:54.442]  And it's about to domino effect when the third world collapses, they'll then flood us, and the UN will control the crisis they created.
[00:15:54.442 --> 00:15:54.862]  Stay with us.
[00:15:58.911 --> 00:16:06.236]  InfoWars is a archetypal classic example of free, independent, organic resistance against tyranny.
[00:16:06.236 --> 00:16:07.677]  You built InfoWars.
[00:16:07.677 --> 00:16:09.198]  You spread the word.
[00:16:09.198 --> 00:16:10.399]  You prayed for us.
[00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:11.780]  You bought the products.
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:12.940]  You called in.
[00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.301]  You made recommendations.
[00:16:14.301 --> 00:16:16.963]  InfoWars is as much yours as it is mine.
[00:16:16.963 --> 00:16:25.129]  And that's why the enemy is so upset that under the deplatforming, under all the DNC lawsuits, under all the attack, in many ways, we've become stronger.
[00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:28.631]  With Band.Video, redesigned InfoWars, with all of our great crew,
[00:16:29.111 --> 00:16:30.092]  We're good to go.
[00:16:59.076 --> 00:17:05.721]  We're coming up in a few months on 14 years that My Patriot Supply has been our big food sponsor.
[00:17:05.721 --> 00:17:08.023]  In the past, I had a bunch of different sponsors.
[00:17:08.023 --> 00:17:11.206]  They'd be good for a while, then they'd become unreliable.
[00:17:11.206 --> 00:17:13.448]  And I just operate off listener reviews.
[00:17:13.448 --> 00:17:15.329]  I personally buy what I like.
[00:17:15.329 --> 00:17:16.850]  And they're the best.
[00:17:16.850 --> 00:17:22.275]  For the price you pay, no one can come even close to the quality of this food.
[00:17:22.275 --> 00:17:23.856]  A lot of it tastes gourmet.
[00:17:23.856 --> 00:17:25.718]  The rest of it tastes, you know, pretty good, okay.
[00:17:26.218 --> 00:17:31.119]  That compared to competition, stuff that costs the same amount, it all tastes like crap.
[00:17:31.119 --> 00:17:32.439]  And that's what you see in the reviews.
[00:17:32.439 --> 00:17:34.479]  That's what you see from the listeners.
[00:17:34.479 --> 00:17:40.200]  Now, they can't go lower, ever, than the prices at InfoWareStore.com because of other distributors.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:52.743]  But they have decided, this is very, very rare, to give us an even better deal at PrepareWithAlex.com, where you can get $600 off of your supply, $300 off six months, $160 off three months, and a bunch of other specials as well.
[00:17:52.743 --> 00:17:54.063]  But it's only for a limited time.
[00:17:54.063 --> 00:17:54.943]  It ends in three days.
[00:17:59.086 --> 00:18:12.657]  For more than a hundred years, the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world government, abolish nation states, dumb down the population by taking control of education, and most importantly, taking control of Western medicine.
[00:18:12.657 --> 00:18:14.659]  Now they had a bad name by the 1920s.
[00:18:14.659 --> 00:18:23.126]  They started converting over and funding other organizations and groups like IBM to continue on with their eugenics operations.
[00:18:23.826 --> 00:18:31.751]  Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates III.
[00:18:31.751 --> 00:18:33.972]  His father, of course, being the head of Planned Parenthood.
[00:18:33.972 --> 00:18:41.976]  And now, he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the world, every national health system.
[00:18:41.976 --> 00:18:44.038]  Bill Gates is in control.
[00:18:44.038 --> 00:18:44.558]  They have spent
[00:18:44.918 --> 00:18:51.948]  A hundred plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in your body.
[00:18:51.948 --> 00:18:59.098]  This is the holy grail of their operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type of DNA in your body.
[00:18:59.098 --> 00:19:01.441]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[00:19:02.282 --> 00:19:10.829]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence is going to be your most valuable asset.
[00:19:10.829 --> 00:19:14.412]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[00:19:14.412 --> 00:19:29.625]  The world being built by the technocrats and the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total and complete dehumanization.
[00:19:30.886 --> 00:19:37.148]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[00:19:37.148 --> 00:19:40.830]  This is their stated goal.
[00:19:40.830 --> 00:19:49.093]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[00:19:49.093 --> 00:19:51.093]  Let me turn this around.
[00:19:51.093 --> 00:19:56.495]  You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips with it.
[00:19:56.495 --> 00:19:58.116]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[00:20:01.112 --> 00:20:15.179]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:15.179 --> 00:20:21.622]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:21.622 --> 00:20:25.504]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and I have extremely good news for all of you.
[00:20:25.504 --> 00:20:28.666]  It's also very, very complex news.
[00:20:30.043 --> 00:20:37.167]  This is a window into the internal battles even going on inside the power structure right now between good and evil.
[00:20:37.167 --> 00:20:55.516]  It was the UN in December of last year that had a two-day emergency summit in an area of Europe where the United Nations likes to base a lot of its operations and where the WHO headquarters is actually based, Geneva, Switzerland.
[00:20:55.516 --> 00:20:58.558]  And they had a two-day conference and a few weeks later they released it.
[00:20:59.383 --> 00:21:01.184]  And then listeners made us aware of it.
[00:21:01.184 --> 00:21:11.248]  In late December, we did a bunch of reports on it, where the UN came out, the head of the WHO vaccine program and said, vaccines are actually harming people more than they're helping.
[00:21:11.248 --> 00:21:13.329]  We're not allowed to even really test them.
[00:21:13.329 --> 00:21:18.251]  We are simply told by big corporations what we are supposed to do.
[00:21:18.251 --> 00:21:23.073]  Well, that's now happened again, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:23.073 --> 00:21:25.054]  That's now happened again.
[00:21:25.054 --> 00:21:28.195]  And we have the head of the United Nations
[00:21:30.015 --> 00:21:50.983]  Envoy from the global COVID-19 response coming out and saying to the world, ladies and gentlemen, that COVID-19 response is killing
[00:21:52.697 --> 00:21:56.598]  More people than it's saving, which is what it's designed to do.
[00:21:56.598 --> 00:21:58.479]  It's the UN that ran the response.
[00:21:58.479 --> 00:22:00.140]  It's the UN we're told is the boss.
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:03.881]  It's the WHO that's in control of all of this.
[00:22:03.881 --> 00:22:05.902]  So look at this National File article.
[00:22:05.902 --> 00:22:17.966]  It has links to the video, World Bank, UN, Harvard, Think Tank, Warren, COVID-19 lockdowns response leading to global starvation, food disruptions.
[00:22:21.305 --> 00:22:24.647]  And then it goes on from there.
[00:22:24.647 --> 00:22:26.688]  We have a live show feed right here.
[00:22:26.688 --> 00:22:28.229]  Global bombshell.
[00:22:28.229 --> 00:22:31.651]  UN says COVID restrictions and lockdowns are killing millions.
[00:22:31.651 --> 00:22:32.551]  Must stop.
[00:22:32.551 --> 00:22:36.173]  This is such a big deal.
[00:22:36.173 --> 00:22:37.894]  Now let's get into who's actually saying it.
[00:22:37.894 --> 00:22:40.596]  Here's the Gateway Pundit article.
[00:22:40.596 --> 00:22:49.701]  Someone tell the Radical Democrats WHO backflips on lockdowns after global economy decimated and world's poor starving.
[00:22:53.274 --> 00:22:59.736]  The World Health Organization is often praised by left-wing radicals and crazy Dr. Fauci.
[00:22:59.736 --> 00:23:10.018]  The World Health Organization in pro-China outfit famously created a global panic by announcing the coronavirus had a mortality rate of 3.4% when it was hundreds of times lower.
[00:23:10.018 --> 00:23:21.241]  The World Health Organization recently backflipped on its horrific miscalculation and now admits the mortality rate of the coronavirus is slightly higher than the seasonal flu, which is really lower then.
[00:23:22.321 --> 00:23:32.244]  This past week, after a global economy was decimated, the World Health Organization backflipped again and admitted the lockdowns are a horrible idea.
[00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:35.565]  Now here's who actually said it.
[00:23:35.565 --> 00:23:36.845]  I went and found his actual statements.
[00:23:36.845 --> 00:23:39.086]  I didn't just believe Gateway Pundit, who's a great source.
[00:23:39.086 --> 00:23:39.646]  I went and got it.
[00:23:42.031 --> 00:23:44.814]  Lockdowns are not the answer to stopping COVID-19.
[00:23:44.814 --> 00:23:54.843]  Yesterday, Dr. David Nabarro from the World Health Organization told world leaders to stop using lockdowns as their primary method to control the spread of the virus.
[00:23:54.843 --> 00:24:04.612]  And they go on to say that it's causing a breakdown and collapse of civilization and that using it as your primary control method is not good and it should stop.
[00:24:06.072 --> 00:24:16.279]  Lockdowns just have one consequence that you must never ever belittle, and that is making poor people an awful lot poorer, he said, and then they starve to death.
[00:24:16.279 --> 00:24:17.220]  Okay?
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:22.563]  So, even people in the UN are coming out and saying this is wrong.
[00:24:22.563 --> 00:24:33.691]  But of course, those that control the UN above it, Bill Gates, the big robber baron foundations, the Rockefellers, that created the United Nations, they know exactly what they are doing.
[00:24:35.538 --> 00:24:49.405]  They create the global crisis, they bring in the cashless society, they bring in the surveillance system, they create a phobia of common colds and the flu, they bring in a work from home system to make humans obsolete, to teach you that you're non-essential.
[00:24:49.405 --> 00:24:58.190]  They are then able to roll out their entire cashless society, and it goes on and on from there.
[00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.512]  Then once the third world starts collapsing because of the supply chain breakdown,
[00:25:03.439 --> 00:25:21.612]  The first world goes into deep debt, the third world starts starving to death, they will then flood their borders to the west, and the UN will then organize them as a political weapon system to override and swamp the first world, and then the UN controls everyone through debt, through poverty, and through medical tyranny.
[00:25:21.612 --> 00:25:23.433]  And the AI surveillance grids.
[00:25:23.433 --> 00:25:26.855]  That is the admitted plan.
[00:25:26.855 --> 00:25:30.758]  And it's now come out that that is the admitted plan.
[00:25:32.662 --> 00:25:38.205]  And so we have the battle plan of this entire system now in our hands.
[00:25:38.205 --> 00:25:44.228]  And we even have the UN head of the WHO vaccine program saying, we don't do testing.
[00:25:44.228 --> 00:25:45.269]  It's hurting people.
[00:25:45.269 --> 00:25:46.850]  The doctors don't think it's good.
[00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:48.111]  Vaccines are killing people.
[00:25:48.111 --> 00:25:48.971]  They're maiming them.
[00:25:48.971 --> 00:25:50.352]  The coverup can't continue.
[00:25:50.352 --> 00:25:51.552]  That's December 2nd, 2019.
[00:25:51.552 --> 00:25:52.893]  Only 10, 11 months ago.
[00:25:52.893 --> 00:25:57.056]  And now you've got this.
[00:26:02.179 --> 00:26:20.447]  With the UN head envoy over COVID-19 response coming out and saying that this is killing way more than it's helping, it's destroying infrastructure, it's destroying economies, it's causing mass starvation, it's destroying poor people, and it's gotta stop!
[00:26:20.447 --> 00:26:22.789]  You can't kill a million people to save 5,000!
[00:26:28.695 --> 00:26:32.557]  But again, wearing the mask, having lockdowns, it doesn't protect you anyways.
[00:26:32.557 --> 00:26:35.658]  The studies show it makes it worse.
[00:26:35.658 --> 00:26:49.965]  But it was all cooked up to create phobias of going outside so we can all be locked up in our houses and be under rolling martial law and rolling house arrest, and that's all any of this has ever been.
[00:26:49.965 --> 00:26:50.866]  Here's another article.
[00:26:50.866 --> 00:26:56.369]  World Bank COVID-19 lockdowns will push as many as 150 million people to extreme poverty by 2021.
[00:26:58.422 --> 00:26:58.782]  The U.N.
[00:26:58.782 --> 00:27:01.223]  goes on to say 280 million people are on the edge of starvation.
[00:27:01.223 --> 00:27:02.803]  It was 135 million.
[00:27:02.803 --> 00:27:04.383]  Two million have already starved to death.
[00:27:04.383 --> 00:27:11.045]  The full video is at band.video and inside these articles.
[00:27:11.045 --> 00:27:17.106]  Learn how the great COVID-19 pandemic of 9-11 starved millions to death.
[00:27:17.106 --> 00:27:18.566]  Again, learn how the great COVID-19 panic of 9-11
[00:27:26.459 --> 00:27:28.641]  I don't understand that headline right there.
[00:27:28.641 --> 00:27:33.706]  Because I wrote that over the phone earlier today.
[00:27:33.706 --> 00:27:36.249]  Learn how the great COVID-19 panic of 9-11.
[00:27:36.249 --> 00:27:36.389]  It's 2020.
[00:27:36.389 --> 00:27:41.574]  That's bizarre.
[00:27:45.854 --> 00:27:46.835]  Anyways, we'll work on that.
[00:27:46.835 --> 00:27:47.775]  We're live on air here.
[00:27:47.775 --> 00:27:48.916]  We'll figure it all out.
[00:27:48.916 --> 00:27:49.976]  I'm the one writing most of this.
[00:27:49.976 --> 00:27:50.937]  I'm the one doing most of it.
[00:27:50.937 --> 00:27:52.858]  I guess I must have put a wrong thing in there.
[00:27:52.858 --> 00:27:55.580]  I'm so crazy, working so much, doing all this all the time.
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:27:57.641]  I'll tell you, I'm pretty much punch drunk right now.
[00:27:57.641 --> 00:28:00.502]  I mean, you know, this is just getting more and more insane by the minute.
[00:28:00.502 --> 00:28:02.624]  I'll just keep fighting as hard as I can.
[00:28:02.624 --> 00:28:07.967]  WHO Director General Special Envoys on COVID-19 Preparedness and Response.
[00:28:07.967 --> 00:28:09.468]  That's David Nabarro.
[00:28:10.575 --> 00:28:12.816]  that came out and said all of this.
[00:28:12.816 --> 00:28:20.461]  When we come back, I'm gonna go over this in more detail and lay it all out for you because it's beyond critical.
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:32.068]  But you go out and you talk to your average leftist out there, they laugh at you, they think it's funny, they think it's a giant, sickening joke, and they totally, absolutely flip you off and enjoy it.
[00:28:32.068 --> 00:28:37.653]  You go, hey, the UN is starving everybody to death, this is killing hundreds of times what COVID does, please.
[00:28:37.653 --> 00:28:40.355]  And they just go, F you Alex Jones, F you Nazi!
[00:28:40.355 --> 00:28:42.316]  And it's literally killing brown people mainly.
[00:28:42.316 --> 00:28:47.160]  It's totally sick, it's totally evil, and the chickens will come home to roost with us.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.502]  I've got so much more to cover on the other side of this quick break.
[00:28:50.502 --> 00:28:51.083]  Please stay with us.
[00:28:58.663 --> 00:29:05.086]  There has never, in my 26 years on air, been a more critical or important time to be self-sufficient.
[00:29:05.086 --> 00:29:08.047]  And listen, I don't sell firearms, I don't sell ammunition.
[00:29:08.047 --> 00:29:13.830]  That is one of the most important things you can have, along with a good relationship with God during times like this.
[00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:20.433]  But what I can help you with is high-quality storable food, high-quality water filtration, all at one place.
[00:29:20.433 --> 00:29:24.634]  Now, you always get the very best deals from my Patriot, memphillworkstore.com.
[00:29:24.634 --> 00:29:25.615]  We are their biggest distributor.
[00:29:26.235 --> 00:29:31.139]  But because of how crazy things are, they have agreed to give us a deal no one else has been able to get.
[00:29:31.139 --> 00:29:38.525]  So this is the lowest price on the lowest price, highest quality, storable food you're going to find at preparewithalex.com.
[00:29:38.525 --> 00:29:42.749]  Now, they've extended it out just three days this upcoming Monday.
[00:29:42.749 --> 00:29:47.893]  We're only 27 days out from the election, and it's about a week or so to be able to ship it to you.
[00:29:47.893 --> 00:29:49.034]  They've got the food on hand.
[00:29:49.454 --> 00:29:53.579]  But they cannot guarantee this one week ship rate in the next month or so.
[00:29:53.579 --> 00:29:55.761]  Things are so crazy and food prices are going up.
[00:29:55.761 --> 00:29:56.862]  So take action now.
[00:29:59.448 --> 00:30:16.140]  The Bible talks about there being ten kings of the earth that sit above the nation states and who give their power unto the one world leader, the Antichrist, and that he has a beast system that no one can buy or sell unless he has that mark in the forehead or in the palm of their hand.
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:23.325]  And we look back on all the warnings that were given and all just the common sense that even if we believe in God,
[00:30:24.085 --> 00:30:25.306]  Or prophecy.
[00:30:25.306 --> 00:30:35.293]  Giving governments and corporations the power to control who can buy and who can sell and to track everything we do is not just a recipe, it's a blueprint for total enslavement.
[00:30:35.293 --> 00:30:46.040]  And now you look at Bill Gates, you look at Bloomberg and others who openly say, we're technocrats, we should decide how much salt you get, how much alcohol you get, how much red meat you get.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:47.561]  We're technocrats, we know best.
[00:30:47.561 --> 00:30:51.423]  We're now going to set up the economy with a social score to totally control you.
[00:30:51.423 --> 00:30:53.165]  You snap your fingers, we're here.
[00:30:54.026 --> 00:30:55.873]  They're just rolling it out.
[00:30:55.873 --> 00:30:57.199]  And a lot of people are complying with it.
[00:30:57.199 --> 00:30:57.821]  It's insane.
[00:30:59.349 --> 00:31:02.270]  2020ElectionsCenter.com.
[00:31:02.270 --> 00:31:05.051]  Just type it in one time, and you've got it saved right there in your browser.
[00:31:05.051 --> 00:31:19.456]  And then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple platforms, and most importantly, via text message, email, or by word of mouth, because they have banned the links to ban.video.
[00:31:19.456 --> 00:31:27.779]  But 2020ElectionsCenter.com is a clone of the site, the exact same links, the exact same videos where you can comment, you can share them, everything.
[00:31:27.779 --> 00:31:28.319]  The system
[00:31:29.279 --> 00:31:34.023]  He's censoring because of the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[00:31:34.023 --> 00:31:38.847]  Trump has finally figured this out, since he's going to take action once re-elected against big tech.
[00:31:38.847 --> 00:31:40.348]  I mean, he's moderating the situation.
[00:31:40.348 --> 00:31:44.811]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry because he has to take an action.
[00:31:44.811 --> 00:31:55.659]  We the people are taking action now, and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com, and checking out the new, redesigned InfoWars.com and sharing that link.
[00:31:55.659 --> 00:31:56.960]  Oh, that really upsets them.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:57.501]  Oh, yeah.
[00:31:59.087 --> 00:32:16.378]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci, and I've been at the NIH and CDC for 45 years, and I've overseen, well, you know, the AIDS pandemic and so many other things, and I take my orders from Bill Gates, Dr. Bill Gates.
[00:32:16.378 --> 00:32:19.280]  I mean, he's not a doctor, but he controls
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.521]  Everything you do.
[00:32:21.521 --> 00:32:25.183]  And he now says, you're going to take the shots.
[00:32:25.183 --> 00:32:29.105]  And of course, in England, they are now saying what I told you.
[00:32:29.105 --> 00:32:30.866]  You will not be allowed to travel.
[00:32:30.866 --> 00:32:35.009]  Leave your home until you take all the shots.
[00:32:35.009 --> 00:32:36.370]  Dr. Gates, I mean Bill.
[00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:44.115]  Gates, your owner, your master, says you will have to take four to five COVID shots a year.
[00:32:44.115 --> 00:32:50.278]  For adult, two for baby, and baby much more manageable.
[00:32:50.278 --> 00:32:53.701]  Just like Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine.
[00:32:53.701 --> 00:33:02.126]  I'm Dr. Fauci, reminding you that we owe you.
[00:33:02.126 --> 00:33:04.788]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.537 --> 00:33:16.158]  Alright folks, we are back live.
[00:33:16.158 --> 00:33:18.158]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:33:18.158 --> 00:33:19.959]  What I'm going to do is...
[00:33:43.613 --> 00:33:48.577]  Next hour, I'm going to get back into the just huge news that the U.N.
[00:33:48.577 --> 00:33:54.401]  admits the lockdown has already killed millions, it's going to kill tens of millions more and needs to stop.
[00:33:54.401 --> 00:33:59.605]  That's the head envoy over the COVID operations from the U.N.
[00:33:59.605 --> 00:34:01.206]  to the nation states.
[00:34:01.206 --> 00:34:07.171]  Now, are they coming their ass for the global depression they started and the mass death?
[00:34:07.171 --> 00:34:08.292]  Probably.
[00:34:08.292 --> 00:34:10.894]  But regardless, it vindicates what we already knew.
[00:34:12.039 --> 00:34:24.262]  We've got the footage of myself and Owen Schroyer going downtown and having about half the people flip us off and say, burn in hell, when we pointed out the COVID lockdowns are killing the third world.
[00:34:24.262 --> 00:34:27.243]  The other half of folks cheered us on and said, you're right.
[00:34:27.243 --> 00:34:32.144]  And there was a big rally also that we attended downtown to end the lockdown.
[00:34:32.144 --> 00:34:33.505]  That video is all at Van.Video.
[00:34:33.505 --> 00:34:34.025]  That's coming up.
[00:34:34.025 --> 00:34:38.486]  And let's talk about, let's talk about the civil war that the deep state
[00:34:39.778 --> 00:34:43.420]  And others are trying to trigger in this country.
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:53.487]  When one of the Patriot Prayer Group folks a month ago got executed in Portland, Oregon, the media tried to cover that up.
[00:34:53.487 --> 00:35:02.332]  And when a man yesterday got executed at another Patriot Prayer Group free speech rally in Denver, the media tried to spin it again.
[00:35:02.332 --> 00:35:04.514]  They also tried to say the people who tried to kidnap the
[00:35:05.751 --> 00:35:10.934]  Governor Whitmer, who the Supreme Court had just ruled is a tyrant, and she had to end her lockdown measures.
[00:35:10.934 --> 00:35:12.054]  She doesn't care.
[00:35:12.054 --> 00:35:13.555]  She's not stopping.
[00:35:13.555 --> 00:35:18.738]  Well, as soon as she got in trouble, and as soon as it came out that she was a dictator, basically, what she was doing was illegal.
[00:35:18.738 --> 00:35:23.601]  Oh, they learned about 13 people that were trying to kill her, or trying to kidnap her.
[00:35:23.601 --> 00:35:26.862]  They were talking about both, reportedly.
[00:35:26.862 --> 00:35:30.304]  We learned their Black Lives Matter in Antifa.
[00:35:30.304 --> 00:35:31.665]  Could have known that from their videos with
[00:35:32.912 --> 00:35:33.372]  We're good to go.
[00:35:45.953 --> 00:35:52.456]  Meanwhile, left-wing security guard charged with first-degree murder in Denver shooting of Trump supporter.
[00:35:52.456 --> 00:35:58.158]  We've got his name, all the details up on InfoWars.com.
[00:35:58.158 --> 00:36:06.701]  Identified as Matthew Doloff, a big leftist who bragged about how he was going to deal with Trump supporters.
[00:36:06.701 --> 00:36:11.623]  The Trump supporter shot by leftist local news bodyguard in Denver has been identified.
[00:36:11.623 --> 00:36:15.345]  That's right, he was a bodyguard for Channel 9 News who executed this guy.
[00:36:16.616 --> 00:36:28.705]  The Trump supporters was shot by local news bodyguard in Denver on Saturday has been identified as veteran and cowboy hat designer Lee Kletner.
[00:36:28.705 --> 00:36:30.867]  So we're going to be covering more of that.
[00:36:30.867 --> 00:36:32.188]  Here's a screenshot.
[00:36:32.188 --> 00:36:39.433]  Denver local news bodyguard who killed Trump supporter bragged about harassing and confronting conservatives in the past.
[00:36:39.433 --> 00:36:45.338]  Now he executed one in broad daylight after the Patriot got attacked, shot some of his
[00:36:46.363 --> 00:36:52.167]  Bear spray when he was punched in the face, so he was executed.
[00:36:52.167 --> 00:36:57.851]  Let's go ahead and roll John Bowne's report dealing with this.
[00:36:57.851 --> 00:36:59.453]  It's very powerful.
[00:36:59.453 --> 00:37:03.556]  The media now is executing American citizens.
[00:37:03.556 --> 00:37:07.639]  And then we're going to come back and play the raw footage of the execution on the other side.
[00:37:07.639 --> 00:37:09.160]  But here is the John Bowne report.
[00:37:10.333 --> 00:37:20.596]  All the left needs is a Hitler-Mussolini-Pol Pot-Chairman Mao-style leader to rally them to a full-blown revolutionary violent overthrow of the United States.
[00:37:20.596 --> 00:37:31.680]  That voice will likely arise from the crumbling ESPN ranks that psychopaths like Keith Olbermann graduate from jockeying for position with their political theater.
[00:37:31.940 --> 00:37:37.382]  The terrorist Trump must be defeated, must be destroyed, must be devoured at the ballot box.
[00:37:37.382 --> 00:37:57.870]  And then he, and his enablers, and his supporters, and his collaborators, and the Mike Lees, and the William Bars, and the Sean Hannity's, and the Mike Pence's, and the Rudy Giuliani's, and the Kyle Rittenhouse's, and the Amy Coney Barrett's must be prosecuted and convicted and removed from our society while we try to rebuild it.
[00:37:58.370 --> 00:38:02.692]  Spewing totalitarian nonsense that sounds vaguely familiar.
[00:38:02.692 --> 00:38:09.536]  Adolf Hitler's first written comments calling for the annihilation of Jews and it's signed by Hitler himself.
[00:38:09.536 --> 00:38:17.361]  The letter was penned decades before the Holocaust in 1919 when Hitler was a German soldier.
[00:38:17.901 --> 00:38:21.203]  But it reveals his early hatred of Jewish people.
[00:38:21.203 --> 00:38:29.127]  In one section he writes that Jews should be denied rights, with the final aim being the uncompromising removal of Jews altogether.
[00:38:29.127 --> 00:38:39.192]  And the Kyle Rittenhouses and the Amy Coney Barretts must be prosecuted and convicted and removed from our society while we try to rebuild it.
[00:38:39.192 --> 00:38:42.894]  The fight is not just to win an election, but to win it by enough.
[00:38:43.434 --> 00:38:49.037]  To chase, at least for a moment, Trump and the maggots off the stage.
[00:38:49.037 --> 00:38:59.864]  This purely un-American hysterical disinformation that continues to fuel what transpired at a Denver, Colorado communist soup drive for the homeless.
[00:38:59.864 --> 00:39:07.588]  A drive that should have been appropriately titled, a hurl soup cans at concerned Americans and defunded police events.
[00:39:07.768 --> 00:39:12.032]  A lot of those guys were from UADF, the United American Defense Force.
[00:39:12.032 --> 00:39:17.117]  The other side, the Communist Party, started attacking the cops, probably within, what, 20 minutes?
[00:39:17.117 --> 00:39:17.398]  Yeah.
[00:39:17.398 --> 00:39:17.778]  20 minutes.
[00:39:17.778 --> 00:39:18.859]  I saw soup cans.
[00:39:18.859 --> 00:39:20.180]  I was up there speaking.
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.982]  Soup cans were flying at the cops.
[00:39:21.982 --> 00:39:24.745]  Again, they said they were doing a soup drive for the homeless.
[00:39:24.745 --> 00:39:25.386]  No, they weren't.
[00:39:25.386 --> 00:39:30.331]  And as a BLM mental patient hurled threats and insults at patriots...
[00:39:30.998 --> 00:39:37.919]  And as a patriot appeared to defend himself with pepper spray after the gun had been drawn, that patriot was shot point-blank in the head.
[00:39:37.919 --> 00:39:43.160]  The BLM instigator celebrated as he left the scene, only to be detained shortly thereafter.
[00:40:02.045 --> 00:40:10.832]  The instigator had deceptively been wearing a Black Guns Matter shirt and appears to be the same agitator from a Bernie Sanders rally.
[00:40:10.832 --> 00:40:16.917]  Surprisingly, the shot was not fired by a left-wing radical Antifa BLM supporter.
[00:40:16.917 --> 00:40:23.282]  A patriot was reportedly murdered in cold blood by the bodyguard of a Denver 9 News producer.
[00:40:23.482 --> 00:40:36.427]  Just so we're clear on this, America, patriotic Americans aren't merely being shot in cold blood by Marxists that are supported by the Democratic Party and the Democratic candidates running for the highest office in the land.
[00:40:36.427 --> 00:40:38.748]  Antifa's an idea, not an organization.
[00:40:38.748 --> 00:40:39.149]  Oh, you got it.
[00:40:39.149 --> 00:40:39.689]  Not militia.
[00:40:39.689 --> 00:40:41.590]  They're not going to stop.
[00:40:41.590 --> 00:40:44.611]  And everyone beware, because they're not going to stop.
[00:40:44.611 --> 00:40:49.513]  They're not going to stop before Election Day in November, and they're not going to stop after Election Day.
[00:40:50.034 --> 00:40:53.478]  And that should be, everyone should take note of that on both levels.
[00:40:53.478 --> 00:40:55.360]  That this isn't, they're not going to let up.
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.561]  And they should not.
[00:40:56.561 --> 00:40:57.643]  And we should not.
[00:40:57.643 --> 00:41:10.437]  The liberal 9 News Denver media has now become the center of an investigation where the life of an American citizen was snuffed out in broad daylight by the tyranny of a Mockingbird media goon.
[00:41:10.817 --> 00:41:16.781]  On the other side, the Denver Communist Party, along with self-described Black Lives Matter and Antifa.
[00:41:16.781 --> 00:41:25.727]  They call it a patriot muster, but that's, you know, they used patriot instead of saying racist, or patriot instead of saying nationalist.
[00:41:25.727 --> 00:41:27.688]  So, you know, we see through that.
[00:41:27.688 --> 00:41:33.973]  A security guard contracted by Nine News through the company Pinkerton got into an altercation with another man.
[00:41:33.973 --> 00:41:38.175]  There was a verbal altercation that transpired.
[00:41:38.175 --> 00:41:39.876]  Firearm was discharged.
[00:41:40.877 --> 00:41:44.479]  Individual was shot and later pronounced deceased.
[00:41:44.479 --> 00:41:51.862]  It has been a practice by Nine News to hire private security guards, as our crews have been covering protests over the last several months in Denver.
[00:41:51.862 --> 00:41:55.204]  Denver police say no one else was arrested at the rallies.
[00:41:55.204 --> 00:41:59.826]  The bodies of people, groups of people, who nobody elected.
[00:41:59.826 --> 00:42:00.586]  Never!
[00:42:00.586 --> 00:42:06.749]  As a matter of fact, most of the people don't like them at all, and yet they exist.
[00:42:06.749 --> 00:42:08.770]  One of such group is media.
[00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:09.510]  Who elected them?
[00:42:12.682 --> 00:42:16.724]  How come they have so much power?
[00:42:16.724 --> 00:42:19.606]  Almost monopolistic power on your mind.
[00:42:19.606 --> 00:42:21.588]  They can rape your mind.
[00:42:21.588 --> 00:42:22.488]  But who elected them?
[00:42:22.488 --> 00:42:32.175]  How come they have a nerve to decide what is good and what is bad for the elected by you, President, and his administration?
[00:42:32.175 --> 00:42:33.636]  Who the hell are they?
[00:42:33.636 --> 00:42:34.897]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:42:36.809 --> 00:42:38.570]  That report is extremely powerful.
[00:42:38.570 --> 00:42:41.133]  It's on Band.Video and Infowars.com.
[00:42:41.133 --> 00:42:42.734]  I suggest you share it.
[00:42:42.734 --> 00:42:44.355]  Execution by liberal media in Denver.
[00:42:44.355 --> 00:42:48.839]  Now the leftist media is actually executing patriots in the street beyond Antifa.
[00:42:48.839 --> 00:42:50.921]  They are at war with us.
[00:42:50.921 --> 00:42:53.843]  We're going to come back and get into all the big campaign news.
[00:42:53.843 --> 00:42:55.664]  And China threatening to attack the United States.
[00:42:55.664 --> 00:42:56.205]  It's all coming up.
[00:42:58.891 --> 00:43:05.414]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much less in the entire world.
[00:43:05.414 --> 00:43:11.437]  InfoWars is standalone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks and hundreds of stations picking us up.
[00:43:11.437 --> 00:43:21.523]  Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense, and exposing the anti-human globalist agenda.
[00:43:22.663 --> 00:43:26.906]  That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at Band.Video.
[00:43:26.906 --> 00:43:31.349]  They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook.
[00:43:31.349 --> 00:43:39.754]  That's why it's so precious, because the censorship expands to everyone, which it is now, with AI monitoring and controlling what you can say and do.
[00:43:39.754 --> 00:43:46.679]  It's going to be the OACs like Band.Video and the now redesigned InfoWars.com that become more and more important, which they are.
[00:43:47.119 --> 00:43:55.115]  And the enemy is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now.
[00:43:55.115 --> 00:43:56.598]  They're coming after everyone.
[00:43:56.598 --> 00:43:57.520]  So spread the word now.
[00:43:59.048 --> 00:44:06.373]  InfoWars is a archetypal classic example of free, independent, organic resistance against tyranny.
[00:44:06.373 --> 00:44:07.814]  You built InfoWars.
[00:44:07.814 --> 00:44:09.335]  You spread the word.
[00:44:09.335 --> 00:44:10.536]  You prayed for us.
[00:44:10.536 --> 00:44:11.917]  You bought the products.
[00:44:11.917 --> 00:44:13.077]  You called in.
[00:44:13.077 --> 00:44:14.438]  You made recommendations.
[00:44:14.438 --> 00:44:17.100]  InfoWars is as much yours as it is mine.
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:25.266]  And that's why the enemy is so upset that under the deplatforming, under all the DNC lawsuits, under all the attack, in many ways, we've become stronger.
[00:44:25.266 --> 00:44:28.768]  With Band.Video, the redesigned InfoWars, with all of our great crew,
[00:44:29.248 --> 00:44:35.212]  With documentary films and 10 hours of live radio and TV a day.
[00:44:35.212 --> 00:44:36.553]  We are the resistance.
[00:44:36.553 --> 00:44:37.433]  You are the resistance.
[00:44:37.433 --> 00:44:47.539]  So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for you to continue to spread the word about it and to continue for you to support because this is something we built together.
[00:44:47.539 --> 00:44:48.840]  It's not just a national treasure.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:53.303]  It's a treasure worldwide against the tyrants and they know it and they can't stand it.
[00:44:53.303 --> 00:44:55.124]  And it's everything we talked about comes true.
[00:44:55.124 --> 00:44:56.945]  Our credibility only goes up together.
[00:44:56.945 --> 00:44:57.846]  So I salute you all.
[00:44:58.843 --> 00:45:03.385]  Introducing InfoWars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[00:45:03.385 --> 00:45:05.927]  This is taken under the tongue.
[00:45:05.927 --> 00:45:08.128]  It is pure turmeric.
[00:45:08.128 --> 00:45:17.313]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[00:45:17.313 --> 00:45:23.176]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[00:45:23.176 --> 00:45:25.317]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[00:45:25.777 --> 00:45:29.000]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.842]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[00:45:30.842 --> 00:45:32.963]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[00:45:32.963 --> 00:45:35.165]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[00:45:35.165 --> 00:45:36.526]  Some like bodies better.
[00:45:36.526 --> 00:45:40.650]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[00:45:40.650 --> 00:45:41.851]  And they fund the InfoWar.
[00:45:41.851 --> 00:45:46.295]  So get our new liquid turmeric extract exclusively at InfoWarStore.com today.
[00:45:46.295 --> 00:45:47.136]  Get an additional 25% off.
[00:45:47.136 --> 00:45:47.676]  This is a 360 win.
[00:45:50.959 --> 00:45:56.043]  Turmeric is renowned for what it does for all of our bodies, for inflammation and so much more.
[00:45:56.043 --> 00:45:59.525]  Get yours today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[00:45:59.525 --> 00:46:02.027]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement.
[00:46:02.027 --> 00:46:04.448]  Everyone knows we need to be self-sufficient.
[00:46:04.448 --> 00:46:10.092]  Everyone with half a brain knows you need to have storable food that's high quality, nutritious, and lasts a long time.
[00:46:10.092 --> 00:46:11.333]  We've got the best sponsor.
[00:46:11.333 --> 00:46:12.854]  They've got the food.
[00:46:12.854 --> 00:46:18.738]  They're ready to ship it to you, but they're going to have to go up on prices in the next few months because of the shortages that have begun.
[00:46:18.738 --> 00:46:20.059]  They have the food on hand.
[00:46:20.439 --> 00:46:24.985]  They're ready to ship it out within a week to a week and a half, but not for much longer.
[00:46:24.985 --> 00:46:28.991]  So they are allowing us this last time big deal.
[00:46:28.991 --> 00:46:30.753]  It's been extended three days.
[00:46:30.753 --> 00:46:34.799]  Specials on top of their biggest specials ever at preparewithalex.com.
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:40.422]  PrepareWithAlex.com has even better deals than InfoWareStore.com.
[00:46:40.422 --> 00:46:46.845]  We're their biggest distributor, so contractually, we have to sell at the same price that they sell at and distributors do, which is already a great deal.
[00:46:46.845 --> 00:46:53.789]  But at PrepareWithAlex.com, they're able to do a promotion on one year, six months, and three months supplies.
[00:46:53.789 --> 00:46:56.590]  $600 off on a year, and it goes from there.
[00:46:56.590 --> 00:47:01.612]  Go to PrepareWithAlex.com.
[00:47:01.612 --> 00:47:04.254]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:17.912 --> 00:47:20.554]  Thank God for the renegades.
[00:47:20.554 --> 00:47:21.234]  Free today.
[00:47:21.234 --> 00:47:23.696]  Some would make him king.
[00:47:23.696 --> 00:47:28.218]  Others couldn't stand for that.
[00:47:28.218 --> 00:47:31.340]  The cross was the solution.
[00:47:31.340 --> 00:47:32.661]  It is October 11th, 2020.
[00:47:46.954 --> 00:47:49.896]  On this Sunday Worldwide Transmission.
[00:47:49.896 --> 00:47:58.121]  And I'm very, very blessed to be here with you today and very thankful for you, the viewers and listeners, for being the InfoWar and keeping us on air.
[00:47:58.121 --> 00:48:01.784]  Thank God for you, the renegades against this global tyranny.
[00:48:01.784 --> 00:48:06.607]  Renegades against, literally, the satanic plan of the New World Order.
[00:48:06.607 --> 00:48:08.748]  Okay, I've got incredible stuff with the campaign.
[00:48:08.748 --> 00:48:10.269]  I can fill the two hours very easily.
[00:48:10.269 --> 00:48:13.872]  You've got two hours coming up, what we call Sunday Night Live.
[00:48:15.094 --> 00:48:18.757]  With Owen Schroyer, only six minutes of ads an hour for local stations.
[00:48:18.757 --> 00:48:20.018]  So that's coming up.
[00:48:20.018 --> 00:48:21.859]  I'm sure whatever I don't get to, he'll get to and more.
[00:48:21.859 --> 00:48:26.462]  But you got Biden up there saying just incredible stuff.
[00:48:26.462 --> 00:48:27.943]  I mean, you thought it was crazy.
[00:48:27.943 --> 00:48:31.666]  He said 200 million Americans died of COVID.
[00:48:31.666 --> 00:48:33.027]  Wait till you hear what he said next.
[00:48:33.027 --> 00:48:36.770]  But video tells a billion words.
[00:48:38.507 --> 00:48:40.467]  This is a video up on Infowars.com.
[00:48:40.467 --> 00:48:43.888]  Biden-Harris kickoff buster in Arizona.
[00:48:43.888 --> 00:48:48.309]  Not a single person shows up.
[00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:51.490]  And this happens everywhere they go.
[00:48:51.490 --> 00:48:57.671]  And then Trump shows campaign videos showing no one's there, and Facebook bans them saying they're misleading.
[00:48:57.671 --> 00:49:01.912]  We've sent people out to cover Democrat events with Joe Biden.
[00:49:01.912 --> 00:49:03.912]  No one's there!
[00:49:03.912 --> 00:49:06.293]  We're talking 50 people in San Antonio!
[00:49:08.939 --> 00:49:12.002]  So when he takes questions, one of our listeners gets the first one in.
[00:49:12.002 --> 00:49:14.124]  Then the fourth questions one of our people.
[00:49:14.124 --> 00:49:15.104]  I mean, he's a joke.
[00:49:15.104 --> 00:49:22.951]  That's why he's hiding and not campaigning, because no one is showing up, which is indicative of what a paper tiger and what a fraud this is.
[00:49:22.951 --> 00:49:25.974]  So here's part of the Fox News piece out of Arizona.
[00:49:27.381 --> 00:49:29.103]  Not much to see.
[00:49:29.103 --> 00:49:32.005]  I'll step out of the way, but it's kind of boring out here.
[00:49:32.005 --> 00:49:35.768]  So it's not your typical presidential campaign event.
[00:49:35.768 --> 00:49:38.510]  We don't see people rallying outside.
[00:49:38.510 --> 00:49:42.073]  We don't see signs or really much of what's going on.
[00:49:42.073 --> 00:49:53.283]  And I'm told by one of the Biden staffers, local staffers, is that they kind of kept the details about the visit as far as the timing and the exact locations.
[00:49:53.964 --> 00:49:58.674]  And pretty much all of the people that we saw enter into the parking lot about...
[00:49:59.778 --> 00:50:06.264]  45 minutes ago, we're with the Biden-Harris campaign and the pool reporters.
[00:50:06.264 --> 00:50:17.114]  So you would expect to see, I mean, this is a pretty big event for the two of them to be campaigning together for the first time since the Democratic National Convention.
[00:50:17.114 --> 00:50:22.979]  Here in Arizona, we've established, our state has established itself as a battleground state.
[00:50:22.979 --> 00:50:23.540]  And so this is
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:26.741]  Technically a big event, but not a lot of fanfare.
[00:50:26.741 --> 00:50:29.701]  So, we're getting information about what's going on with these media.
[00:50:29.701 --> 00:50:30.421]  Okay, so that's enough.
[00:50:30.421 --> 00:50:33.522]  The full video is on InfoWars.com.
[00:50:33.522 --> 00:50:35.342]  I suggest you share the article, okay?
[00:50:35.342 --> 00:50:36.683]  If you want to expose them.
[00:50:36.683 --> 00:50:39.763]  Because, here's the deal, you think, oh, we'll beat them easily.
[00:50:39.763 --> 00:50:40.283]  Oh no!
[00:50:40.283 --> 00:50:46.365]  Oh no, because they're going to contest the election, and they're going to call the United Nations in.
[00:50:46.365 --> 00:50:52.086]  They're going to have all the blue state governors secede, according to John Podesta.
[00:50:55.418 --> 00:50:57.859]  Look at these headlines.
[00:50:57.859 --> 00:50:58.879]  Fake poll alert.
[00:50:58.879 --> 00:51:00.279]  Proof Biden's not winning.
[00:51:00.279 --> 00:51:01.900]  Town Hall breaks it all down.
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:04.220]  How Trump's really winning with the real poll numbers.
[00:51:04.220 --> 00:51:06.881]  Sure, just like four years ago.
[00:51:06.881 --> 00:51:08.941]  Powered by trust.
[00:51:08.941 --> 00:51:10.082]  ABC News.
[00:51:10.082 --> 00:51:11.762]  Oh, yes.
[00:51:11.762 --> 00:51:13.363]  Powered by trust.
[00:51:13.363 --> 00:51:16.563]  ABC News ought to change their slogan to that.
[00:51:16.563 --> 00:51:18.124]  Powered by trust in the pandemic.
[00:51:18.124 --> 00:51:20.664]  Biden leads by 12 points.
[00:51:20.664 --> 00:51:22.325]  Really, Hillary was leading by like 35 points.
[00:51:25.711 --> 00:51:28.233]  Taliban slain CBS fake news.
[00:51:28.233 --> 00:51:29.875]  Refutes claim they endorsed Trump.
[00:51:29.875 --> 00:51:31.937]  Just made up.
[00:51:31.937 --> 00:51:36.080]  Biden says chicanery at polls is the only way he can lose the U.S.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:36.441]  election.
[00:51:39.175 --> 00:51:41.657]  Joe Biden, there's a video, but cue it up.
[00:51:41.657 --> 00:51:46.079]  Babbling about Supreme Court proves he knows nothing about the Constitution.
[00:51:46.079 --> 00:51:49.682]  He says that Trump's packing the court and it's unconstitutional.
[00:51:49.682 --> 00:52:01.369]  No, the Democrats adding four more justices to 13, or I guess like Venezuela packed their court up like 40-something people last time I checked.
[00:52:01.369 --> 00:52:03.110]  That's how communists do it.
[00:52:03.110 --> 00:52:05.732]  Yeah, so go ahead and roll Biden lying, here it is.
[00:52:09.811 --> 00:52:11.212]  Oh, stop this.
[00:52:11.212 --> 00:52:15.714]  Stop it again.
[00:52:27.625 --> 00:52:32.250]  Why am I covering the fact that they have a transcript you can barely understand of him saying it's unconstitutional?
[00:52:32.250 --> 00:52:34.493]  Trell's packing the court right now, which isn't true.
[00:52:34.493 --> 00:52:39.138]  He literally has to virtue signal on a tarmac in the sunshine with high wind.
[00:52:39.138 --> 00:52:42.422]  If he had a deadly disease, you couldn't get it, much less COVID.
[00:52:42.422 --> 00:52:43.363]  It's like a common cold.
[00:52:44.411 --> 00:52:46.212]  Just Bill Gates patented it and owns it.
[00:52:46.212 --> 00:52:47.192]  With Fauci, literally.
[00:52:47.192 --> 00:52:48.173]  Look it up.
[00:52:48.173 --> 00:52:49.254]  At Wuhan.
[00:52:49.254 --> 00:52:50.774]  Even Newsweek reported on that.
[00:52:50.774 --> 00:52:54.656]  So, so, I love it.
[00:52:54.656 --> 00:52:57.078]  I'm Bane, Batman.
[00:52:57.078 --> 00:52:59.519]  Batman's not afraid of the dark.
[00:52:59.519 --> 00:53:01.860]  I live in the dark.
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:04.682]  I mean, it's all a clown show.
[00:53:04.682 --> 00:53:08.864]  This is the traitors, the chi-coms, and the globalist guy.
[00:53:08.864 --> 00:53:09.784]  Sorry, start it over.
[00:53:09.784 --> 00:53:11.145]  Let's just see if we can understand any of it.
[00:53:14.266 --> 00:53:20.103]  Why wait until after the election?
[00:53:32.523 --> 00:53:47.534]  I mean, this is clown world!
[00:53:52.449 --> 00:53:55.070]  But it's like, oh, he's winning because he wears the mask.
[00:53:55.070 --> 00:53:56.090]  He's a hero.
[00:53:56.090 --> 00:54:06.193]  He's a subservient idiot of the CHICOMS that, with Bill Gates, started the hysteria, exaggerated the death toll 100-fold, and then did all this.
[00:54:06.193 --> 00:54:13.175]  Meanwhile, even Jake Tapper shreds the Biden campaign, saying that, no, it's not unconstitutional for them to do what they're doing.
[00:54:13.175 --> 00:54:16.856]  All right, now let's talk about what's really going on right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:54:18.763 --> 00:54:25.068]  Let's talk about what's really going on right here with a delicious overhead shot right here.
[00:54:25.068 --> 00:54:29.952]  Because that's what's really unfolding.
[00:54:29.952 --> 00:54:34.115]  Get ready to resist the Trump coup.
[00:54:34.115 --> 00:54:36.717]  Get ready to resist the Trump coup attempt.
[00:54:36.717 --> 00:54:42.802]  That's the Star Tribune.
[00:54:42.802 --> 00:54:48.367]  How we should defend against an impending Trump coup attempt.
[00:54:49.534 --> 00:54:51.855]  Common dreams.
[00:54:51.855 --> 00:54:57.097]  The Trump campaign is reportedly plotting an election coup to bypass the Biden win.
[00:54:57.097 --> 00:54:57.918]  Vanity fair.
[00:54:57.918 --> 00:55:05.741]  10 things you need to know to stop a coup.
[00:55:05.741 --> 00:55:07.122]  Here's one of the New York Times.
[00:55:07.122 --> 00:55:08.963]  There will be no Trump coup.
[00:55:08.963 --> 00:55:12.884]  And they go on to say we have the military and everybody we're going to remove him.
[00:55:12.884 --> 00:55:14.345]  So they admit a coup in this article.
[00:55:16.561 --> 00:55:22.988]  Meanwhile they attacked Stuart Rhodes for in September 30th saying there's a coup plot against the president.
[00:55:22.988 --> 00:55:25.030]  In Atlantic Monthly.
[00:55:26.755 --> 00:55:39.302]  Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal actually wrote a big in-depth report called An American Coup Attempt and shows where they ran the attempted coup during the campaign when he was president-elect after and ever since then.
[00:55:39.302 --> 00:55:49.828]  It actually gives real concrete examples of them trying the coup, calling it a coup on TV to give confidence to the coup supporters.
[00:55:49.828 --> 00:55:54.171]  And then of course you've got, we'll play the clip in a moment, of good old
[00:55:56.613 --> 00:56:07.716]  Sports commentator they brought back out of retirement, Keith Olbermann, to say that all of Trump's supporters seem to be rounded up as well.
[00:56:07.716 --> 00:56:17.879]  So, they're saying we've got a coup plot, but they can't get anybody at their rallies, nobody shows up, they're mailing all these fake ballots to screw the election up, so they can just dispute it.
[00:56:17.879 --> 00:56:19.299]  They know they're losers.
[00:56:19.299 --> 00:56:21.880]  These are the traitors that sold out to foreign powers.
[00:56:21.880 --> 00:56:22.520]  These are the enemy.
[00:56:23.444 --> 00:56:24.905]  So he says we're the enemy?
[00:56:24.905 --> 00:56:31.711]  My God, we've got Channel 9 gunning an unarmed man down in Denver for Antifa.
[00:56:31.711 --> 00:56:33.973]  Charged with murder.
[00:56:33.973 --> 00:56:34.373]  Today.
[00:56:34.373 --> 00:56:39.458]  We got Antifa, BLM, and the media killing us.
[00:56:39.458 --> 00:56:42.060]  We got Keith Olbermann saying they're gonna wipe us out.
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:44.322]  And then wondering why people go out and do it.
[00:56:44.322 --> 00:56:45.523]  Here's what Keith Olbermann had to say.
[00:56:45.523 --> 00:56:51.048]  Trump can be, and must be, expunged.
[00:56:51.661 --> 00:56:58.527]  The hate he has triggered, the Pandora's box he has opened, they will not be so easily destroyed.
[00:56:58.527 --> 00:57:01.089]  So, let us brace ourselves.
[00:57:01.089 --> 00:57:02.791]  The task is twofold.
[00:57:02.791 --> 00:57:08.216]  The terrorist Trump must be defeated, must be destroyed, must be devoured at the ballot box.
[00:57:08.216 --> 00:57:17.684]  And then he, and his enablers, and his supporters, and his collaborators, and the Mike Lees, and the William Bars, and the Sean Hannity's, and the Mike Pence's,
[00:57:17.924 --> 00:57:29.392]  And the Rudy Giuliani's and the Kyle Rittenhouse's and the Amy Coney Barrett's must be prosecuted and convicted and removed from our society while we try to rebuild it.
[00:57:29.392 --> 00:57:30.313]  And to rebuild... Oh, that's enough.
[00:57:30.313 --> 00:57:30.953]  Did you hear that?
[00:57:30.953 --> 00:57:32.194]  We need to be convicted!
[00:57:32.194 --> 00:57:35.216]  And they've got grand juries open on everybody.
[00:57:35.216 --> 00:57:38.598]  Thousands of Trump supporters.
[00:57:38.598 --> 00:57:46.004]  They've got them open, literally just salivating for the Biden win to just arrest us the minute it happens.
[00:57:46.004 --> 00:57:46.264]  Watch.
[00:57:48.308 --> 00:57:53.832]  This is your last chance to get a Peck Power Stack, and I'm really bummed out about that.
[00:57:53.832 --> 00:57:58.975]  It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did order it loved it and started reordering it.
[00:57:58.975 --> 00:58:01.297]  They spread the word and became one of our best sellers.
[00:58:01.297 --> 00:58:03.899]  But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown,
[00:58:04.279 --> 00:58:07.760]  Because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:19.062]  We are unable to secure it anymore This is the highest in a MPM pack system You're gonna find where you take half the pills in the morning half the capitals and pills and gel caps at night.
[00:58:19.062 --> 00:58:25.844]  It's amazing I don't have time to go into everything that's in it But this gets people to remember to take it and that's why it's having such a great effect.
[00:58:25.844 --> 00:58:25.864]  I
[00:58:26.004 --> 00:58:27.966]  Because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing.

[00:59:51.648 --> 00:59:54.270]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:02.771 --> 01:00:09.658]  Just another day in 2020, a police shooting decision puts an American community on edge yet again.
[01:00:09.658 --> 01:00:17.946]  This time over the shooting death of 17-year-old Alvin Cole by Wauwatosa police officer Joseph Mensa back in February.
[01:00:17.946 --> 01:00:20.408]  Details of the incident became available.
[01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:27.495]  Officers spotted Cole, another man and a woman, leaving the parking garage south of the Nordstrom store at the local mall.
[01:00:37.139 --> 01:00:39.960]  Police detained the man with him but Cole kept running.
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:44.401]  He was pursued by three officers including Mensa and a mall security guard.
[01:00:44.401 --> 01:00:50.784]  A shot was discharged from Cole's vicinity and Cole went to the ground with a firearm in his right hand.
[01:00:51.904 --> 01:01:05.030]  All three officers said Cole was ordered to surrender the firearm, but he instead pointed it in their direction.
[01:01:17.216 --> 01:01:23.680]  According to the Milwaukee Journal-Senatel, this was the third shooting death by Mensa while in the line of duty in the last five years.
[01:01:43.274 --> 01:01:48.638]  Mensa also shot and killed Antonio Gonzalez in 2015 and Jay Anderson Jr.
[01:01:48.638 --> 01:01:49.678]  in 2016.
[01:01:49.678 --> 01:01:57.744]  Gonzalez went into a suicidal death by cop rage, reportedly brandishing kitchen knives and a sword, and Anderson Jr.
[01:01:57.744 --> 01:02:00.566]  was shot six times while sitting in his car.
[01:02:00.566 --> 01:02:03.808]  Whether or not Anderson lunged for a weapon is debatable.
[01:02:04.431 --> 01:02:12.474]  Well, police say a group of protesters showed up outside of a home where Joseph Mensah was staying and things quickly escalated from there.
[01:02:12.474 --> 01:02:18.937]  Police say a group of about 60 people gathered around the home near 100th and Vienna Street and vandalized it.
[01:02:18.937 --> 01:02:26.020]  They say as Mensah tried to talk with the crowd, that's when he was physically assaulted and a shot was fired at the back door.
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:35.326]  But of course, this case strays from the Derek Chauvin-George Floyd racist police narrative because both the officer and the victim are black.
[01:02:35.326 --> 01:02:39.689]  But that didn't stop the mob from ramping up the prejudicial poison.
[01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:40.729]  Black Lives Matter?
[01:02:40.729 --> 01:02:41.630]  Absolutely!
[01:02:48.124 --> 01:02:49.705]  As well as all lives.
[01:02:49.705 --> 01:02:54.847]  Wauwatosa authorities aren't taking any chances, though, calling a 7 p.m.
[01:02:54.847 --> 01:02:55.688]  to 6 a.m.
[01:02:55.688 --> 01:03:09.174]  curfew, shutting down City Hall until Monday, barring hardware stores from selling anything that could be used to burn or loot property, and shutting down most businesses while the National Guard is on standby.
[01:03:09.174 --> 01:03:16.177]  And since the decision had enough time to marinate, the usual BLM Antifa agitators had time to mobilize.
[01:03:16.538 --> 01:03:24.001]  As CNN and Michelle Obama's fiery but mostly peaceful rioters literally attacked residential homes.
[01:03:43.712 --> 01:03:51.202]  Meanwhile, Kamala Harris used the Charlottesville hoax as a paramount point in her vice presidential debate strategy.
[01:03:57.304 --> 01:04:14.621]  The need for racial justice, where a young woman was killed, and on the other side there were neo-Nazis carrying tiki torches, shouting racial epithets, anti-Semitic slurs, and Donald Trump when asked about it said,
[01:04:15.845 --> 01:04:18.467]  There were fine people on both sides.
[01:04:18.467 --> 01:04:21.389]  This is who we have as the President of the United States.
[01:04:21.389 --> 01:04:28.934]  Senator Harris conveniently omitted after the President made comments about people on either side of the debate over monuments.
[01:04:28.934 --> 01:04:35.858]  He condemned the KKK, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists and has done so repeatedly.
[01:04:35.858 --> 01:04:43.644]  The President of the United States took a debate stage in front of 70 million Americans and refused to condemn white supremacists.
[01:04:44.798 --> 01:04:51.849]  A total lie used to draw in gullible voters and support the mob mentality destroying America.
[01:04:51.849 --> 01:04:53.051]  John Bowne reporting.
[01:04:57.654 --> 01:05:11.205]  For more than a hundred years, the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world government, abolish nation states, dumb down the population by taking control of education, and most importantly, taking control of Western medicine.
[01:05:11.205 --> 01:05:13.206]  Now they had a bad name by the 1920s.
[01:05:13.206 --> 01:05:21.673]  They started converting over and funding other organizations and groups like IBM to continue on with their eugenics operations.
[01:05:22.373 --> 01:05:30.316]  Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates III.
[01:05:30.316 --> 01:05:32.517]  His father, of course, being the head of Planned Parenthood.
[01:05:32.517 --> 01:05:40.541]  And now, he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the world, every national health system.
[01:05:40.541 --> 01:05:42.582]  Bill Gates is in control.
[01:05:42.582 --> 01:05:43.102]  They have spent
[01:05:43.482 --> 01:05:50.507]  A hundred plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in your body.
[01:05:50.507 --> 01:05:56.731]  This is the holy grail of their operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type of DNA in your body.
[01:06:08.483 --> 01:06:14.993]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:28.642 --> 01:06:41.289]  All right, we're gonna play footage here in a few minutes of myself and Owen Schroer driving through Austin yesterday and a lot of folks supported us, a lot of people were ambivalent, others were telling us go to hell, they would hope we died.
[01:06:41.289 --> 01:06:44.971]  We've got footage of that we're gonna roll here in a few minutes.
[01:06:44.971 --> 01:06:51.574]  Because we were bullhorning and also on a loud PA system that was going like five, six blocks up, it's very loud.
[01:06:53.464 --> 01:07:13.750]  That the UN-directed, Bill Gates-directed, world government-directed lockdown has already starved two million people to death, according to the UN, and hundreds of millions are set to starve to death, and the world financial system and food supply and delivery supply chain is breaking down.
[01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:15.111]  I mean, that's quite a headline.
[01:07:15.111 --> 01:07:16.051]  Global bombshell.
[01:07:16.051 --> 01:07:21.333]  UN says COVID restrictions and lockdowns are killing millions.
[01:07:21.333 --> 01:07:21.893]  Must stop.
[01:07:24.764 --> 01:07:32.969]  I've got like a four minute report we're going to play again of us driving through Austin, but I was out at the park two weeks ago.
[01:07:32.969 --> 01:07:33.629]  You saw the footage.
[01:07:33.629 --> 01:07:36.351]  We played it here.
[01:07:36.351 --> 01:07:42.555]  And I just launched a drone that had a little speaker on it over Zilker Park, downtown Austin, saying, hey, the UN admits
[01:07:43.922 --> 01:07:54.647]  The COVID-19 lockdowns are killing millions, but the UN doesn't ever say, in the lockdowns, they say, give us money to deliver food to people's houses, but they just keep the money and the people die.
[01:07:54.647 --> 01:07:55.648]  We've got the reports right here.
[01:07:56.755 --> 01:08:03.959]  So I came out and I said, how dare the UN COVID program and their head of rapid response and their head envoy and all of them.
[01:08:03.959 --> 01:08:07.141]  I said, they're guilty if they don't do something of murder.
[01:08:07.141 --> 01:08:10.443]  Two million have already starved to death, their own numbers, their accurate numbers.
[01:08:10.443 --> 01:08:15.346]  And they admit a hundred and something million can starve to death the next year, 200 plus million in the next two years.
[01:08:15.346 --> 01:08:17.247]  And these are all headlines I'm about to show you.
[01:08:17.247 --> 01:08:23.391]  Because when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[01:08:23.391 --> 01:08:23.571]  Well,
[01:08:25.615 --> 01:08:26.515]  I'll be, you know what?
[01:08:26.515 --> 01:08:41.983]  The WHO Director General Special Envoy on COVID-19 Preparedness and Response came out yesterday, David Nabarro.
[01:08:41.983 --> 01:08:43.564]  Zoom in a little bit closer on that for me, please.
[01:08:43.564 --> 01:08:45.985]  A lot of folks are watching on their phones.
[01:08:45.985 --> 01:08:46.646]  They can't see that.
[01:08:46.646 --> 01:08:48.787]  There it is.
[01:08:48.787 --> 01:08:50.988]  He came out and he said,
[01:08:52.324 --> 01:08:55.587]  It's causing a lot more harm than good and needs to stop.
[01:08:55.587 --> 01:08:58.310]  You can read his full statement, Gateway Pundit has an article about it.
[01:08:58.310 --> 01:09:03.715]  And there's the head of the UN vaccine program saying it's killing people, they're covering it up, it's got to stop.
[01:09:03.715 --> 01:09:04.957]  That was December last year.
[01:09:04.957 --> 01:09:07.840]  So they get orders from the big banks that own and run the UN.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:09.201]  The Rockefellers set it up.
[01:09:09.201 --> 01:09:13.765]  They have Operation Lockstep that said they'll bring in world government and have the UN take over.
[01:09:13.765 --> 01:09:16.108]  But the UN itself is just a corporate front group.
[01:09:19.022 --> 01:09:21.723]  Big article on nationalfile.com.
[01:09:21.723 --> 01:09:30.305]  World Bank, UN, Harvard, think tanks all agree and warn COVID-19 lockdowns and response leading to global starvation, food disruptions.
[01:09:30.305 --> 01:09:32.486]  And here's the deal.
[01:09:32.486 --> 01:09:36.827]  Maybe you're a eugenicist like Bill Gates or the Rockefellers.
[01:09:36.827 --> 01:09:38.688]  You think, well, there are too many Africans.
[01:09:38.688 --> 01:09:44.630]  Let's cut off their supply chain and not buy the crops they sell us and not buy the flowers they sell us.
[01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:47.371]  One of the biggest things Africa grows is flowers.
[01:09:47.371 --> 01:09:48.211]  Let's just screw them.
[01:09:48.991 --> 01:09:56.476]  Okay, well the UN is going to use the refugee flows as a political weapon to bring them in, and then use them as a political tool to bring us down as well.
[01:09:56.476 --> 01:10:00.118]  Because if you think Bill Gates hates people in Africa, he really hates you.
[01:10:00.118 --> 01:10:05.642]  I don't care what color you are, he wants power and control over everyone.
[01:10:05.642 --> 01:10:06.383]  Period.
[01:10:06.383 --> 01:10:13.667]  This is total domination.
[01:10:13.667 --> 01:10:14.208]  So that's it.
[01:10:16.087 --> 01:10:19.417]  But imagine you walk up to left and say, hey, I need your help.
[01:10:21.411 --> 01:10:22.151]  The U.N.
[01:10:22.151 --> 01:10:28.515]  ordered lockdowns killing millions and millions, hundreds of times more than COVID, and it's designed like that by Bill Gates.
[01:10:28.515 --> 01:10:31.256]  And they just go, shut up, you racist filth!
[01:10:31.256 --> 01:10:41.882]  And they flip you off and get really excited, like they do about abortion, like they do about infanticide or euthanasia of old people, because they have a satanic spirit.
[01:10:41.882 --> 01:10:42.843]  I've been around them.
[01:10:42.843 --> 01:10:45.224]  The average leftist loves death.
[01:10:45.224 --> 01:10:46.725]  They love power.
[01:10:46.725 --> 01:10:50.287]  They love the fact that they're first world and other people aren't.
[01:10:51.027 --> 01:10:51.807]  But here's the difference.
[01:10:51.807 --> 01:10:52.748]  You care.
[01:10:52.748 --> 01:10:53.488]  You might be old.
[01:10:53.488 --> 01:10:54.129]  You might be young.
[01:10:54.129 --> 01:10:54.809]  You might be black.
[01:10:54.809 --> 01:10:55.769]  You might be white.
[01:10:55.769 --> 01:10:57.510]  You understand you have empathy.
[01:10:57.510 --> 01:11:00.772]  That what is allowed to be done to these poor people will be done to you.
[01:11:00.772 --> 01:11:03.553]  But here's the article at GatewayPundit.com.
[01:11:03.553 --> 01:11:13.138]  Someone tell the Radical Democrats WHO backflips on lockdowns and global economy decimated and world's poor are starving to death.
[01:11:13.138 --> 01:11:13.878]  So important.
[01:11:13.878 --> 01:11:14.518]  Full video.
[01:11:14.518 --> 01:11:18.000]  Full articles on InfoWars.com.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.281]  But let's roll out to break.
[01:11:20.404 --> 01:11:21.045]  Take your mask off!
[01:11:21.045 --> 01:11:21.625]  Be free again!
[01:11:21.625 --> 01:11:22.165]  Take your mask off!
[01:11:22.165 --> 01:11:22.546]  Be free again!
[01:11:46.001 --> 01:11:49.122]  You must remove your mask.
[01:11:49.122 --> 01:11:56.646]  The mask is a symbol of slavery and a symbol of collapse of the economic world.
[01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:59.787]  Take off your mask!
[01:11:59.787 --> 01:12:02.309]  Take off your mask!
[01:12:02.309 --> 01:12:06.531]  The third world is starving to death because of the lockdown.
[01:12:06.531 --> 01:12:08.772]  The lockdown is killing millions.
[01:12:08.772 --> 01:12:13.194]  COVID-19 is the Davos Group's global reset.
[01:12:14.187 --> 01:12:18.032]  ...to collapse the economy by design.
[01:12:18.032 --> 01:12:20.074]  Free Texas now!
[01:12:20.074 --> 01:12:22.116]  Free Texas now!
[01:12:22.116 --> 01:12:23.858]  Free Texas now!
[01:12:23.858 --> 01:12:25.280]  Free Texas now!
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:35.264]  And we must re-elect Trump and tell him that he must reject it, too.
[01:12:35.264 --> 01:12:42.509]  And if Governor Abbott doesn't reopen Texas, he's not gonna be living in that mansion anymore!
[01:12:42.509 --> 01:12:45.031]  Our message to Governor Abbott is this.
[01:12:45.031 --> 01:12:48.894]  We now know that they've exaggerated the COVID-19 deaths 99.9%.
[01:12:48.894 --> 01:12:55.280]  We now know they've had false testing that counted folks that died of other things as COVID deaths.
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:58.082]  And it's time to end the COVID hoax
[01:12:58.622 --> 01:13:02.465]  You're here in defiance of the Bill Gates U.N.
[01:13:02.465 --> 01:13:04.226]  lockdowns, and I salute you!
[01:13:21.736 --> 01:13:24.158]  Turn back and do the right thing, Abbott!
[01:13:24.158 --> 01:13:26.519]  And to free Texas now!
[01:13:26.519 --> 01:13:28.321]  Free Texas now!
[01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:30.042]  Free Texas now!
[01:13:30.042 --> 01:13:31.883]  Free Texas now!
[01:13:31.883 --> 01:13:32.603]  Free Texas now!
[01:13:32.603 --> 01:13:37.547]  The only time they got mad at me was when I started saying Abbott can turn back, they hate him so much now.
[01:13:39.417 --> 01:13:41.318]  Do not destroy your legacy.
[01:13:41.318 --> 01:13:43.019]  Do not enslave Texas.
[01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:44.620]  Do the right thing.
[01:13:44.620 --> 01:13:46.681]  Admit that you got conned.
[01:13:46.681 --> 01:13:50.483]  Please, you're making Texas hate you forever.
[01:13:50.483 --> 01:13:56.126]  Governor Abbott, the lockdown has already killed 2 million people in Africa.
[01:13:56.126 --> 01:13:56.566]  The U.N.
[01:13:56.566 --> 01:13:59.187]  admits hundreds of millions will starve to death.
[01:13:59.187 --> 01:14:03.990]  And the United Nations is the group with Davos orchestrating the lockdown.
[01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:06.891]  The lockdown is the killer, not COVID-19.
[01:14:08.232 --> 01:14:11.315]  The lockdown is the killer, not COVID-19.
[01:14:11.315 --> 01:14:15.899]  Governor Abbott, I know you're not stupid.
[01:14:15.899 --> 01:14:18.662]  I know you know 94% of the deaths were something else.
[01:14:20.123 --> 01:14:24.904]  In the lockdown, Bill Gates says we're never taking the mask off.
[01:14:24.904 --> 01:14:28.905]  Bill Gates says we're all going to take forced inoculations.
[01:14:28.905 --> 01:14:32.546]  Bill Gates says we are his slaves and he owns us.
[01:14:32.546 --> 01:14:37.046]  And I say Bill Gates can burn in hell!
[01:14:37.046 --> 01:14:38.607]  Burn in hell!
[01:14:38.607 --> 01:14:40.727]  Bill Gates, burn in hell!
[01:14:40.727 --> 01:14:43.708]  Bill Gates, burn in hell!
[01:14:43.708 --> 01:14:44.348]  Bill Gates,
[01:14:44.708 --> 01:14:47.251]  Burn in hell, Bill Gates!
[01:14:47.251 --> 01:14:49.654]  Burn in hell, Bill Gates!
[01:14:49.654 --> 01:14:53.278]  The lockdown is killing millions, not COVID.
[01:14:53.278 --> 01:14:57.923]  The lockdown is still happening in the third world.
[01:14:57.923 --> 01:15:00.065]  This is an economic weapon.
[01:15:00.065 --> 01:15:03.589]  We must stand against the globalists now.
[01:15:05.103 --> 01:15:08.286]  Free the world now!
[01:15:08.286 --> 01:15:11.288]  Free the world now!
[01:15:11.288 --> 01:15:16.032]  Infowars.com stands with human life.
[01:15:16.032 --> 01:15:22.718]  Bill Gates and the UN have launched COVID so they can make us all run into our houses and never leave again.
[01:15:23.593 --> 01:15:26.554]  And then, of course, it's Obama with the cages, lady.
[01:15:26.554 --> 01:15:30.074]  But you don't care that it's Obama with the cages.
[01:15:30.074 --> 01:15:33.035]  You like to live in delusional land.
[01:15:33.035 --> 01:15:34.615]  You say no more cages.
[01:15:34.615 --> 01:15:40.437]  And it is the lockdown that is causing millions and millions to die.
[01:15:40.437 --> 01:15:42.077]  Take your mask off.
[01:15:42.077 --> 01:15:43.557]  Be free again.
[01:15:43.557 --> 01:15:45.078]  Take your mask off.
[01:15:45.078 --> 01:15:45.898]  Be free again.
[01:15:47.108 --> 01:15:51.532]  Alright, then full reports at InfoWars.com, but this is such a huge topic.
[01:15:51.532 --> 01:15:52.833]  Alright, Trump's on the offense.
[01:15:52.833 --> 01:15:53.954]  We'll talk about it when we come back.
[01:15:53.954 --> 01:15:54.635]  Stay with us.
[01:15:56.786 --> 01:16:13.495]  The Bible talks about there being ten kings of the earth that sit above the nation states and who give their power unto the one world leader, the Antichrist, and he has a beast system that no one can buy nor sell unless he has that mark in the forehead or in the palm of their hand.
[01:16:13.495 --> 01:16:24.662]  And we look back on all the warnings that were given and all just the common sense that even if we don't believe in God or prophecy, giving governments and corporations the power
[01:16:25.342 --> 01:16:29.064]  To control who can buy and who can sell to track everything we do.
[01:16:29.064 --> 01:16:32.626]  It's not just a recipe, it's a blueprint for total enslavement.
[01:16:32.626 --> 01:16:43.372]  And now you look at Bill Gates, you look at Bloomberg and others who openly say, we're technocrats, we should decide how much salt you get, how much alcohol you get, how much red meat you get.
[01:16:43.372 --> 01:16:44.813]  We're technocrats, we know best.
[01:16:44.813 --> 01:16:48.756]  We're now going to set up the economy with a social score to totally control you.
[01:16:48.756 --> 01:16:50.517]  You snap your fingers, we're here.
[01:16:51.357 --> 01:16:53.221]  They're just rolling it out.
[01:16:53.221 --> 01:16:54.524]  And a lot of people are complying with it.
[01:16:54.524 --> 01:16:55.145]  It's insane.
[01:16:56.926 --> 01:17:03.571]  We're coming up in a few months on 14 years that My Patriot Supply has been our big food sponsor.
[01:17:03.571 --> 01:17:05.872]  In the past, I had a bunch of different sponsors.
[01:17:05.872 --> 01:17:09.075]  They'd be good for a while, then they'd become unreliable.
[01:17:09.075 --> 01:17:13.177]  And I just operate off listener reviews, and I personally buy what I like.
[01:17:13.177 --> 01:17:14.719]  And they're the best.
[01:17:14.719 --> 01:17:20.122]  For the price you pay, no one can come even close to the quality of this food.
[01:17:20.122 --> 01:17:21.703]  A lot of it tastes gourmet.
[01:17:21.703 --> 01:17:23.565]  The rest of it tastes, you know, pretty good, okay.
[01:17:24.065 --> 01:17:28.968]  That compared to competition, stuff that costs the same amount, it all tastes like crap.
[01:17:28.968 --> 01:17:30.309]  And that's what you see in the reviews.
[01:17:30.309 --> 01:17:32.330]  That's what you see from the listeners.
[01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:38.054]  Now, they can't go lower, ever, than the prices at InfoWarsTore.com because of other distributors.
[01:17:38.054 --> 01:17:50.402]  But they have decided, this is very, very rare, to give us an even better deal at PrepareWithAlex.com, where you can get $600 off your supply, $300 off six months, $160 off three months, and a bunch of other specials as well.
[01:17:50.402 --> 01:17:51.943]  But it's only for a limited time.
[01:17:51.943 --> 01:17:52.824]  It ends in three days.
[01:17:56.506 --> 01:17:59.867]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[01:17:59.867 --> 01:18:01.848]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[01:18:01.848 --> 01:18:05.570]  Is your city too safe?
[01:18:05.570 --> 01:18:07.311]  Well, not anymore!
[01:18:07.311 --> 01:18:09.732]  Introducing... Democrats!
[01:18:09.732 --> 01:18:13.995]  Politicians so incompetent, they'll fill your neighborhood with riots!
[01:18:13.995 --> 01:18:14.315]  Looting!
[01:18:15.442 --> 01:18:18.664]  Rampant violence and even homelessness.
[01:18:18.664 --> 01:18:23.688]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old-fashioned stupidity.
[01:18:23.688 --> 01:18:26.069]  No more pesky law and order.
[01:18:26.069 --> 01:18:29.732]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[01:18:29.732 --> 01:18:34.335]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back, and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[01:18:35.115 --> 01:18:36.076]  But wait!
[01:18:36.076 --> 01:18:44.940]  Vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes, and more taxes!
[01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:47.982]  Democrats, bringing chaos right to your front door!
[01:18:56.875 --> 01:18:59.776]  2020ElectionsCenter.com.
[01:18:59.776 --> 01:19:02.476]  Just type it in one time, and you've got it saved right there in your browser.
[01:19:02.476 --> 01:19:16.979]  And then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple platforms, but most importantly, via text message, email, or by word of mouth, because they have banned the links to banned video.
[01:19:16.979 --> 01:19:25.301]  But 2020ElectionsCenter.com is a clone of the site, the exact same links, the exact same videos, where you can comment, you can share them, everything.
[01:19:25.301 --> 01:19:25.841]  The system,
[01:19:26.721 --> 01:19:27.802]  Oh, that really upsets him.
[01:19:27.802 --> 01:19:28.162]  Oh, yeah.
[01:19:59.543 --> 01:20:12.429]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:20:12.429 --> 01:20:13.150]  Welcome back, folks.
[01:20:13.150 --> 01:20:14.150]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:20:14.150 --> 01:20:18.352]  Let's let this great music roll a little bit longer.
[01:20:18.352 --> 01:20:23.635]  You know, I talk about my own psychological point of view because it's the only way I can try to describe things to you.
[01:20:24.710 --> 01:20:28.492]  Like, I was doing a lot of research today and ready to come here and do a whole show.
[01:20:28.492 --> 01:20:39.897]  And about an hour and a half before I went live, I saw that the UN head envoy came out and said, yeah, we're killing a lot more people than we're saving with the lockdowns and with the mask and with the economic breakdown.
[01:20:39.897 --> 01:20:41.478]  We need to stop it.
[01:20:41.478 --> 01:20:45.160]  And then I did a deep dive researching that and who he was and the rest of it.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:48.922]  And it was just, it was just them covering their ass for what they're about to do.
[01:20:48.922 --> 01:20:52.563]  So they can say it was all a big mistake.
[01:20:52.563 --> 01:20:52.943]  And I'm not,
[01:20:54.281 --> 01:20:59.786]  This isn't about me, but people need to get this part if you want to get everything.
[01:20:59.786 --> 01:21:14.739]  I'm not up here totally upset about this because I'm some bleeding heart goody two-shoe that wants to virtue signal that I love black people.
[01:21:14.739 --> 01:21:17.101]  I'm not a fake leftist.
[01:21:17.101 --> 01:21:20.704]  I fundamentally see people being cut off and starved to death as a threat to me.
[01:21:21.752 --> 01:21:27.057]  Yeah, I care about them, I have empathy, but I'm able to analyze why God gave me empathy.
[01:21:27.057 --> 01:21:37.067]  Because if I see my neighbors or somebody 5,000 miles away being enslaved by a group that's already pretty much running my country, do I have solidarity with those people?
[01:21:37.067 --> 01:21:38.548]  Yeah.
[01:21:38.548 --> 01:21:42.652]  You think an admission they're killing them makes me happy?
[01:21:42.652 --> 01:21:45.775]  You think being confirmed again that it's going on?
[01:21:45.775 --> 01:21:45.815]  No!
[01:21:48.339 --> 01:21:53.000]  Because here's the thing, they admit much more, I'm not going to just be able to sit here anymore and talk about it.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:56.420]  Because they're killing a bunch of people.
[01:21:56.420 --> 01:21:57.421]  And it's not funny!
[01:21:57.421 --> 01:22:04.722]  Let me tell you, the people at the UN are scared.
[01:22:04.722 --> 01:22:06.322]  They know what they're putting in those vaccines.
[01:22:06.322 --> 01:22:13.224]  That's why they had that meeting in December, saying, we're told to do this, we're not allowed to test it, and a lot of folks are getting sick and dying.
[01:22:13.224 --> 01:22:14.964]  And then Associated Press comes out and says,
[01:22:16.465 --> 01:22:22.172]  Tens of thousands of kids are dying, hundreds of thousands are getting paralyzed for life!
[01:22:22.172 --> 01:22:33.585]  Well, their family's got to take care of them, where your little daughter or son you love has got no muscles and has got polio in a wheelchair for the rest of their life, because Bill Gates likes to do that to people.
[01:22:36.257 --> 01:22:38.979]  You think AP came out with that because they care?
[01:22:38.979 --> 01:22:41.180]  They did that to cover their ass.
[01:22:41.180 --> 01:22:47.085]  You think Bill Gates goes on CBS and says, yeah, 700,000 of you are going to get sick or die?
[01:22:47.085 --> 01:22:52.328]  You think they told you 100% get sick with one of his vaccines and 80% with the other because they like you?
[01:22:52.328 --> 01:22:59.774]  They're getting ready to make you take it and admit it all, even though it's going to hurt you!
[01:22:59.774 --> 01:23:04.217]  You know, if you studied the Aztecs, the Babylonians, all these other cultures, the Druids,
[01:23:05.603 --> 01:23:10.666]  Mothers and fathers willingly will lead their three-year-olds up to an altar.
[01:23:10.666 --> 01:23:13.648]  And there'd be the high priest in his outfit.
[01:23:13.648 --> 01:23:17.970]  Even back in the day, in most cultures, he had his face covered in case somebody got pissed later.
[01:23:17.970 --> 01:23:20.552]  They'd give them their son or daughter and they'd take that kid up there.
[01:23:21.425 --> 01:23:27.653]  And they tie their hands or they give them a drink of drugs to make them submit and they cut their heart out right in front of their parents.
[01:23:27.653 --> 01:23:30.316]  That's government wanting power.
[01:23:30.316 --> 01:23:35.382]  Every culture is taken over by sickos that make you... Their favorite's a three-year-old.
[01:23:35.382 --> 01:23:39.527]  Leave your little three-year-old up there to get killed in front of the whole village.
[01:23:40.188 --> 01:23:42.189]  You think you're going to question the village now?
[01:23:42.189 --> 01:23:45.490]  And it's never the chiefs that do this.
[01:23:45.490 --> 01:23:50.991]  You'll have strong chiefs, strong group, organized, good at whatever, good at agriculture, good at war.
[01:23:50.991 --> 01:23:56.813]  You'll build a little tribe, and right when the tribe hits about 5,000 people in anthropology,
[01:23:58.717 --> 01:24:00.778]  The priest class rises.
[01:24:00.778 --> 01:24:08.440]  And every time they serve dark entities, the priests are taking drugs that let them interface with the entities, interdimensionally.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.980]  This is the best theory on what's going on.
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:12.381]  It's what the Pentagon believes.
[01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:16.462]  And they give them dark knowledge on how to control people, and that's what they do.
[01:24:16.462 --> 01:24:17.502]  And then the priests take over.
[01:24:19.121 --> 01:24:28.563]  Well, I'm not leading my family up that damn pit to have them thrown off into a pit of water, to have their heart cut out, to serve this satanic system.
[01:24:28.563 --> 01:24:35.124]  But that's all any of this is, and make no mistakes ever.
[01:24:35.124 --> 01:24:44.806]  That's what abortion is, it's what infanticide is, it's what euthanasia is, it's the same cult that every culture ends up following during their decline right before they collapse.
[01:24:48.308 --> 01:24:53.152]  And now they want us to lead our sons in, because that's what the vaccines are designed for, to target males.
[01:24:53.152 --> 01:24:56.915]  That's why 95% of autism's boys, it's designed for them.
[01:24:56.915 --> 01:25:00.377]  Blood-brain barrier on boys is about a third as thick.
[01:25:00.377 --> 01:25:02.239]  And they hit our boys with lobotomy.
[01:25:02.239 --> 01:25:08.443]  The average boy gets an IQ reduction, health problems in life, neurological disorders, Parkinson's later.
[01:25:08.443 --> 01:25:11.306]  But, you know, a few get overcooked, like Gates talks about.
[01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:15.028]  He goes, yeah, some people get really sick so that all of you have the effect.
[01:25:15.028 --> 01:25:16.790]  And the effect is sterilization.
[01:25:18.080 --> 01:25:19.301]  But it can't be everybody.
[01:25:19.301 --> 01:25:21.021]  It's gotta be a percentage.
[01:25:21.021 --> 01:25:24.283]  Then they hit you with enough things, nobody can tell what hit you.
[01:25:24.283 --> 01:25:27.544]  It's called killing you softly.
[01:25:27.544 --> 01:25:29.185]  Soft kill weapons.
[01:25:29.185 --> 01:25:31.546]  Killing you quietly.
[01:25:31.546 --> 01:25:33.667]  Brad Pitt had a stupid movie where he's a hitman.
[01:25:33.667 --> 01:25:36.608]  I forget the name, but it's like killing you softly or something.
[01:25:36.608 --> 01:25:39.689]  It's not a term he came up with, it's a Pentagon term.
[01:25:39.689 --> 01:25:41.350]  He has a guy who helped him do a murder.
[01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:44.431]  He walks around, hey, thanks a lot, shoots him in the head.
[01:25:44.431 --> 01:25:45.792]  Never knew what hit him.
[01:25:45.792 --> 01:25:46.352]  Well, guess what?
[01:25:47.674 --> 01:25:48.935]  Guess what, Bill Gates?
[01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:50.096]  Guess what, world?
[01:25:50.096 --> 01:25:52.377]  We know what hit us.
[01:25:52.377 --> 01:25:59.882]  And we're not gonna play along with you just so I can get some C at your table.
[01:25:59.882 --> 01:26:05.506]  And so, the UN head of vaccine program says, don't take vaccines, they're killing people.
[01:26:05.506 --> 01:26:15.813]  And then you see this huge Operation Gates launches for who he represents to like just say, okay, it is killing people and it is making you sick and you're gonna take it!
[01:26:15.813 --> 01:26:16.634]  You're gonna take it!
[01:26:18.663 --> 01:26:27.106]  Now does that mean as a man I'm going to let the UN weaponize Africa when it collapses and then march tens of millions, hundreds of millions of Africans in to take over?
[01:26:27.106 --> 01:26:27.667]  No!
[01:26:27.667 --> 01:26:30.368]  I'm against that and I'll fight them.
[01:26:30.368 --> 01:26:34.069]  But I want them to be free in their country and if they come here legally that's fine.
[01:26:34.069 --> 01:26:39.131]  But I understand, see that's, people don't have third dimensional warfare which is even a base level.
[01:26:39.131 --> 01:26:40.232]  Much less fourth, fifth, sixth.
[01:26:41.837 --> 01:26:44.258]  They go, well my God, if you're for the third world, you should let everybody in.
[01:26:44.258 --> 01:26:45.938]  Oh, so the Democrats can run them?
[01:26:45.938 --> 01:26:50.900]  See, the globalists are sterilizing, poisoning, euthanizing people all over the world.
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:54.201]  But then they brainwash certain groups and bring them here as a weapon.
[01:26:54.201 --> 01:26:55.742]  Because they're attacking us too.
[01:26:55.742 --> 01:26:59.043]  You think Bill Gates is just a white supremacist?
[01:26:59.043 --> 01:27:02.224]  He's an anti-humanist.
[01:27:02.224 --> 01:27:04.965]  He's a post-humanist exterminist.
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:11.504]  He believes humanity's broken because he's broken.
[01:27:11.504 --> 01:27:16.850]  He's projecting his hate of himself onto you and me.
[01:27:16.850 --> 01:27:23.959]  So I give human dignity to everybody because I demand it myself, and I will stand up for everybody's right to life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness, but not at my expense.
[01:27:25.455 --> 01:27:34.042]  And when they implode the third world, which they're doing with this, and as the collapse becomes evident and hundreds of millions are dying, by next year already millions are dead.
[01:27:34.042 --> 01:27:37.004]  It's a domino effect though, it's logarithmic.
[01:27:37.004 --> 01:27:42.649]  The UN is going, oh my god, everybody's starving to death, we need to stop this, because they're covering their demonic asses.
[01:27:45.069 --> 01:27:58.452]  And then, when they're surging over the borders, and things are being destroyed, and everything's collapsing, and we're permanently all screwed, Africans, Americans, it doesn't matter, remember who did it to you!
[01:27:58.452 --> 01:28:01.153]  Have a memory!
[01:28:01.153 --> 01:28:03.874]  What does the Globalist Minions always say?
[01:28:03.874 --> 01:28:06.014]  What does Jonathan Gruber say?
[01:28:06.014 --> 01:28:07.635]  What does Rothkopf say?
[01:28:07.635 --> 01:28:08.555]  What does Kissinger say?
[01:28:08.555 --> 01:28:13.276]  They say, thank God you don't have a memory.
[01:28:16.443 --> 01:28:20.467]  Africa can be a beautiful jewel, high-tech, incredible science, great people.
[01:28:20.467 --> 01:28:21.969]  They've never been allowed to have it.
[01:28:21.969 --> 01:28:27.175]  Just like we got it for a little bit with the Renaissance, it's about to be taken from us as well!
[01:28:27.175 --> 01:28:35.463]  And we'll be kept poor in shacks so the globalists can feel above us, then they'll just phase our ass out, robot police everywhere, hell on earth!
[01:28:36.164 --> 01:28:39.247]  But I say, no matter what color you are or where you came from, you've got red blood.
[01:28:39.247 --> 01:28:50.580]  And I say, as humans, we can come together and recognize this threat and unify and destroy the globalist, satanic takeover, and then we'll have unlimited living space in the stars!
[01:28:50.580 --> 01:28:54.224]  But we must first pass through the gate of Satan!
[01:28:56.499 --> 01:29:02.901]  There has never, in my 26 years on air, been a more critical or important time to be self-sufficient.
[01:29:02.901 --> 01:29:05.882]  And listen, I don't sell firearms, I don't sell ammunition.
[01:29:05.882 --> 01:29:11.664]  That is one of the most important things you can have, along with a good relationship with God during times like this.
[01:29:11.664 --> 01:29:18.266]  But what I can help you with is high-quality storable food, high-quality water filtration, all at one place.
[01:29:18.266 --> 01:29:22.468]  Now, you always get the very best deals from my patreon, memphilmorestore.com.
[01:29:22.468 --> 01:29:23.428]  We are their biggest distributor.
[01:29:24.068 --> 01:29:28.972]  But because of how crazy things are, they have agreed to give us a deal no one else has been able to get.
[01:29:28.972 --> 01:29:36.358]  So this is the lowest price on the lowest price, highest quality, affordable food you're going to find at preparewithalex.com.
[01:29:36.358 --> 01:29:40.582]  Now, they've extended it out just three days this upcoming Monday.
[01:29:40.582 --> 01:29:45.726]  We're only 27 days out from the election, and it's about a week or so to be able to ship it to you.
[01:29:45.726 --> 01:29:49.710]  They've got the food on hand, but they cannot guarantee this one-week ship rate.
[01:29:50.330 --> 01:29:51.395]  In the next month or so.
[01:29:51.395 --> 01:29:53.585]  Things are so crazy and food prices are going up.
[01:29:53.585 --> 01:29:54.711]  So take action now!
[01:29:57.256 --> 01:30:04.581]  InfoWars is a archetypal classic example of free, independent, organic resistance against tyranny.
[01:30:04.581 --> 01:30:06.002]  You built InfoWars.
[01:30:06.002 --> 01:30:07.523]  You spread the word.
[01:30:07.523 --> 01:30:08.724]  You prayed for us.
[01:30:08.724 --> 01:30:10.105]  You bought the products.
[01:30:10.105 --> 01:30:11.265]  You called in.
[01:30:11.265 --> 01:30:12.626]  You made recommendations.
[01:30:12.626 --> 01:30:15.288]  InfoWars is as much yours as it is mine.
[01:30:15.288 --> 01:30:23.454]  And that's why the enemy is so upset that under the deplatforming, under all the DNC lawsuits, under all the attack, in many ways, we've become stronger.
[01:30:23.454 --> 01:30:26.956]  With Band.Video, the redesigned InfoWars, with all of our great crew,
[01:30:27.436 --> 01:30:28.436]  We're good to go.
[01:30:56.767 --> 01:30:59.948]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[01:30:59.948 --> 01:31:08.512]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence, is going to be your most valuable asset.
[01:31:08.512 --> 01:31:12.093]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[01:31:12.093 --> 01:31:24.778]  The world being built by the technocrats, and the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown, is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total
[01:31:25.978 --> 01:31:28.520]  Incomplete dehumanization.
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:34.664]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[01:31:34.664 --> 01:31:38.507]  This is their stated goal.
[01:31:38.507 --> 01:31:48.053]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy can we turn this around.
[01:31:48.773 --> 01:31:54.137]  You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips with it.
[01:31:54.137 --> 01:31:55.798]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[01:31:57.011 --> 01:32:03.533]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much less in the entire world.
[01:32:03.533 --> 01:32:09.576]  InfoWars is standalone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks at hundreds of stations picking us up.
[01:32:09.576 --> 01:32:20.020]  Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense, and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:25.024]  That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at Band.Video.
[01:32:25.024 --> 01:32:29.488]  They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook.
[01:32:29.488 --> 01:32:37.895]  That's why it's so precious, because the censorship expands to everyone, which it is now, with AI monitoring and controlling what you can say and do.
[01:32:37.895 --> 01:32:44.822]  It's going to be the OACs like Band.Video and the now redesigned Infowars.com that become more and more important, which they are.
[01:32:45.242 --> 01:32:52.849]  And the enemy is suing us, attacking us, attacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now.
[01:32:52.849 --> 01:32:54.711]  Because they're coming after everyone.
[01:32:54.711 --> 01:32:58.934]  So spread the word now.
[01:32:58.934 --> 01:33:01.577]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:16.178 --> 01:33:18.740]  I got no friends because they read the papers.
[01:33:18.740 --> 01:33:23.024]  From the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:23.024 --> 01:33:34.633]  You know, I actually became a better person being persecuted by the globalists.
[01:33:34.633 --> 01:33:40.717]  I'm still not perfect, far from it, but I'm a much, much better person than I used to be.
[01:33:40.717 --> 01:33:42.379]  God, I used to care what people thought about me.
[01:33:44.005 --> 01:33:46.145]  Not as much as others, but I still did.
[01:33:46.145 --> 01:33:48.606]  It's so freeing not to give a damn.
[01:33:48.606 --> 01:33:53.307]  The only integrity I have is with God, and that's the only person that matters at the end of the day.
[01:33:53.307 --> 01:33:58.648]  And I'm ashamed of myself in front of God, but I'm getting better.
[01:33:58.648 --> 01:34:00.288]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:34:00.288 --> 01:34:04.569]  Okay, let's talk cold, hard facts in Turkey here.
[01:34:04.569 --> 01:34:05.469]  Let's look at these headlines.
[01:34:05.469 --> 01:34:08.390]  This is out of the Star Tribune, LA Times, New York Times.
[01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:10.070]  I mean, these are all the headlines right here.
[01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:12.331]  Get ready to resist the Trump coup attempt.
[01:34:13.251 --> 01:34:19.055]  Remember, the left doesn't want a coup, they just call it a coup, they've been caught doing a coup, but Trump's gonna have a coup.
[01:34:19.055 --> 01:34:34.247]  And they define it in all these articles as the same talking point, that if Trump challenges the election in any way, or challenges fake ballots or dead cats voting, it's now dead cats voting, literally, that he's a dictator.
[01:34:34.247 --> 01:34:36.348]  Well that's oxymoronic.
[01:34:36.348 --> 01:34:39.791]  Well yeah, they don't care, they think their constituents are morons.
[01:34:41.001 --> 01:34:41.481]  Which they are.
[01:34:41.481 --> 01:34:44.863]  And they think they'll go out and riot.
[01:34:44.863 --> 01:34:49.766]  And then when it's a bunch of white meth heads out burning stuff down, they'll say, oh look, it's Black Lives Matter.
[01:34:49.766 --> 01:34:55.829]  Trump's attacking the black people in a desperate attempt to manipulate black Americans into this.
[01:34:55.829 --> 01:34:56.930]  And I don't see it working.
[01:34:56.930 --> 01:34:58.151]  What do you see happening?
[01:34:58.151 --> 01:34:59.972]  I see a backlash.
[01:34:59.972 --> 01:35:00.552]  Here's another one.
[01:35:00.552 --> 01:35:05.795]  How we should defend against the impending Trump coup.
[01:35:05.795 --> 01:35:09.117]  It's been the deep state trying to coup him with Russiagate and all the rest of it.
[01:35:10.831 --> 01:35:11.852]  Here's another one.
[01:35:11.852 --> 01:35:12.813]  Vanity Fair.
[01:35:12.813 --> 01:35:19.581]  The Trump campaign is reportedly plotting an election coup to bypass the Biden win.
[01:35:19.581 --> 01:35:20.562]  All made up.
[01:35:20.562 --> 01:35:22.123]  You read the articles, which you already knew.
[01:35:22.123 --> 01:35:25.027]  They're like, yeah, we're going to challenge it if there's evidence of fraud.
[01:35:25.027 --> 01:35:27.609]  They call that bypass.
[01:35:27.609 --> 01:35:30.753]  10 things you know about the way to stop a coup.
[01:35:30.753 --> 01:35:31.534]  Then there's this article.
[01:35:33.476 --> 01:35:35.459]  There will be no coup.
[01:35:35.459 --> 01:35:45.795]  And the article goes on to say he's a coward, he's a loser, he's a paper tiger, he's a fraud.
[01:35:45.795 --> 01:35:48.219]  Trump won't stand up when we take it from him.
[01:35:49.770 --> 01:35:55.934]  This is a classic story of somebody in a newspaper that hates America trying to get other people to go out.
[01:35:55.934 --> 01:35:57.596]  Oh, you can kick that guy's ass.
[01:35:57.596 --> 01:35:58.977]  Like, well, he's about six foot five.
[01:35:58.977 --> 01:36:02.099]  He's got arms bigger than his tree trunks and legs are even bigger.
[01:36:02.099 --> 01:36:09.984]  I mean, he's over there like... He's like bending that steel bar like it's a pretzel.
[01:36:09.984 --> 01:36:13.767]  You can go on over there and kick his ass.
[01:36:13.767 --> 01:36:15.668]  I mean, that's all this is.
[01:36:15.668 --> 01:36:16.509]  You ought to read the article.
[01:36:16.509 --> 01:36:17.710]  I mean, I'm not joking when I say that.
[01:36:22.242 --> 01:36:28.968]  They call him all these names and they say, but don't worry, when we push him aside, he'll go.
[01:36:28.968 --> 01:36:35.373]  Or like the Washington Post said a month ago, we'll arrest members of his cabinet who don't go along with our coup.
[01:36:35.373 --> 01:36:41.078]  And you just heard Oberman, he said, oh, we're going to arrest all his supporters, all the prominent ones.
[01:36:41.078 --> 01:36:45.502]  We're going to put the Supreme Court nominee in a prison cell.
[01:36:48.663 --> 01:36:55.605]  I mean, it's like Joseph Stalin, or Adolf Hitler, or Mao Tse Tung, or Fidel Castro just got reborn.
[01:36:55.605 --> 01:37:02.647]  I mean, this isn't like, oh, they're showing authoritarian tendencies.
[01:37:02.647 --> 01:37:10.629]  This is like going to the Indy 500, and you see a race car and a driver, and you go, I'm betting on that one.
[01:37:10.629 --> 01:37:13.510]  And then the last mile of the race, they take the pole position.
[01:37:13.510 --> 01:37:14.630]  I mean, it is the most...
[01:37:15.627 --> 01:37:21.230]  Naked authoritarianism I've ever seen anywhere.
[01:37:21.230 --> 01:37:25.572]  I mean, even Hitler and people didn't brag like this when they weren't in power.
[01:37:25.572 --> 01:37:33.676]  They kind of secretly did it later, once they were in power.
[01:37:33.676 --> 01:37:36.558]  These people are crazy.
[01:37:36.558 --> 01:37:37.118]  Really crazy.
[01:37:38.677 --> 01:37:42.582]  But you see, they gotta keep all their moles and all their minions still in government.
[01:37:42.582 --> 01:37:47.848]  Like Comey said last year, oh stay in there, we're gonna get rid of Trump, stay in there, don't leave.
[01:37:47.848 --> 01:37:51.352]  And that's all this is because none of them have been held accountable.
[01:37:51.352 --> 01:37:52.954]  So why shouldn't they continue to do all this?
[01:37:53.746 --> 01:37:55.788]  And that's what's so dangerous about it.
[01:37:55.788 --> 01:37:58.190]  I don't care about retribution with these people.
[01:37:58.190 --> 01:38:00.331]  These people are soulless demons.
[01:38:00.331 --> 01:38:02.553]  They've got God to deal with.
[01:38:02.553 --> 01:38:04.835]  But the problem is they don't go away.
[01:38:04.835 --> 01:38:08.918]  They just stay there like undead zombies.
[01:38:08.918 --> 01:38:13.422]  Maybe I should read the article.
[01:38:13.422 --> 01:38:19.987]  Three weeks from now, we will reach an end to the speculation about what Donald Trump will do if he faces political defeat.
[01:38:21.220 --> 01:38:25.701]  Whether he will leave power like a normal president or attempt some wild resistance.
[01:38:25.701 --> 01:38:44.965]  Reality will intrude substantially if not definitely into an argument or whether the president is corrupt and incompetent who postures as a strong man on Twitter or a threat to the Republic to whom the words like authoritarianism and even autocrat can be reasonably applied.
[01:38:46.869 --> 01:38:50.536]  I've been on the first side of the argument since the early days of the presidency.
[01:38:50.536 --> 01:38:57.769]  And since we're nearing either an ending or some pull-defying reset, like last time, let me make the case one more time.
[01:38:58.735 --> 01:39:04.716]  Across the last four years, the Donald Trump administration has indeed displayed hallmarks of authoritarianism.
[01:39:04.716 --> 01:39:15.779]  It features egregious internal sycophantry and hacks in high positions, abusive presidential rhetoric, and bandacity on an unusual scale.
[01:39:15.779 --> 01:39:23.841]  The president's attempts to delegitimize the 2020 vote aren't novel, it goes on to say, but the coward will stand down.
[01:39:25.734 --> 01:39:27.575]  He will go away.
[01:39:27.575 --> 01:39:31.038]  He lacks power over the media, and it goes on.
[01:39:31.038 --> 01:39:33.059]  Even Fox News is against him.
[01:39:33.059 --> 01:39:37.982]  He lacks popularity and political skill, unlike other global strongmen.
[01:39:37.982 --> 01:39:38.883]  He's a coward.
[01:39:38.883 --> 01:39:39.964]  He's a fool.
[01:39:39.964 --> 01:39:42.245]  The CIA and FBI will take him out.
[01:39:42.245 --> 01:39:45.067]  I mean, you gotta go read this article.
[01:39:45.067 --> 01:39:52.152]  This is the most snot-nosed declaration of evil ever, other than Keith Olbermann saying they're gonna arrest everybody.
[01:39:52.152 --> 01:39:53.293]  But why is this so important?
[01:39:55.998 --> 01:40:10.506]  Well, the Wall Street Journal has an article, an American coup attempt, which actually lays out the real, on record, trying to overthrow the election, illegal spying, setting people up, putting innocent people in prison, what they really did.
[01:40:10.506 --> 01:40:17.609]  I mean, everything the Democrats say they are.
[01:40:17.609 --> 01:40:20.551]  Everything they say President Trump is, is what they are.
[01:40:22.597 --> 01:40:29.021]  And their God is a psychotic demon, Hillary Clinton.
[01:40:29.021 --> 01:40:30.442]  Now let me shift gears here.
[01:40:30.442 --> 01:40:33.725]  We're going to go to the final segment, then I'm going to cover this.
[01:40:33.725 --> 01:40:35.986]  Trump is 22 days out.
[01:40:35.986 --> 01:40:36.787]  Taking the gloves off.
[01:40:37.717 --> 01:40:41.342]  And he is excoriating members of his cabinet that are being cowards.
[01:40:41.342 --> 01:40:42.583]  And he's really hitting on all cylinders.
[01:40:42.583 --> 01:40:44.966]  We'll talk about when we come back.
[01:40:44.966 --> 01:40:47.650]  Separately, there's like 10 hours left.
[01:40:47.650 --> 01:40:52.135]  We want to get the highest quality storable foods out there at the lowest price and ready to ship within one week.
[01:40:52.967 --> 01:41:08.784]  With all this uncertainty and all the craziness going on and all the globalist activity, I would get a six-month, a year food supply of high-quality, affordable foods in the last 25 years that are also Patriots, and then it also funds this operation.
[01:41:08.784 --> 01:41:11.748]  Nine hours, 17 minutes, 54 seconds left.
[01:41:14.141 --> 01:41:18.925]  To get the lowest price on the highest quality storable food on top of the lowest price.
[01:41:18.925 --> 01:41:24.509]  You haven't seen a sale in five years from my Patreon, but I got them to do it at preparewithalex.com.
[01:41:24.509 --> 01:41:26.230]  Preparewithalex.com.
[01:41:26.230 --> 01:41:27.271]  A one-year food supply.
[01:41:27.271 --> 01:41:29.472]  Already lowest price, highest quality.
[01:41:29.472 --> 01:41:30.893]  $600 off.
[01:41:30.893 --> 01:41:33.876]  A six-month, $300 off.
[01:41:33.876 --> 01:41:36.618]  A three-month, $160 off.
[01:41:36.618 --> 01:41:40.801]  And a bunch of other specials at preparewithalex.com.
[01:41:40.801 --> 01:41:43.283]  And when this sale is over,
[01:41:44.571 --> 01:41:59.325]  In the early morning hours of today, that is it, because they told me they can't do it anymore, because their other distributors are getting pissed off that I already have the lowest prices at InfoWareStore.com on their full catalog of food, and now I've got them to do this even lower price, which they think undercuts the market.
[01:41:59.325 --> 01:42:00.586]  I don't think it works like that.
[01:42:00.586 --> 01:42:05.290]  People tune into their shows, aren't tuning into mine, but they're a big sponsor out there for a lot of their big radio shows.
[01:42:05.290 --> 01:42:06.551]  We have the best price already.
[01:42:06.551 --> 01:42:08.793]  This is the best price on the best price.
[01:42:08.793 --> 01:42:09.955]  It ends in nine hours.
[01:42:11.317 --> 01:42:13.181]  At PrepareWithAlex.com.
[01:42:13.181 --> 01:42:15.525]  They put the PrepareWithAlex.com up there.
[01:42:15.525 --> 01:42:16.908]  I will also tell you the toll-free number.
[01:42:17.910 --> 01:42:22.392]  You can call and have all of your questions answered and also get that food.
[01:42:22.392 --> 01:42:29.655]  But they have food ready to deliver to you right now at preparewithalex.com.
[01:42:29.655 --> 01:42:30.776]  Just throw the graphic back up, guys.
[01:42:30.776 --> 01:42:35.938]  The lower third, and it's got a lower third, a little toll-free number that is the specific number.
[01:42:35.938 --> 01:42:41.440]  You can always call my toll-free number to get the general food, but maybe we'll add it in post for folks.
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:44.982]  We're live right now, but it's just a preparewithalex.com graphic.
[01:42:46.135 --> 01:42:48.638]  And when you put that up on the screen, there it is, 888-411-0350, 888-411-0350.
[01:42:48.638 --> 01:42:49.319]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:56.741 --> 01:43:01.142]  The globalists are very, very honest about their planetary goals.
[01:43:01.142 --> 01:43:09.863]  They want private corporate governance above nation states, above religious institutions, above the family.
[01:43:09.863 --> 01:43:12.684]  They want total corporate power.
[01:43:12.684 --> 01:43:19.685]  There was a great film back in the early 1970s called Rollerball with James Caan, and it's based on a novel set in the year 2020.
[01:43:19.685 --> 01:43:20.345]  And in the book,
[01:43:23.226 --> 01:43:28.550]  You have megacorporations that control the planet, and there are no longer nation-states.
[01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:33.053]  There are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations.
[01:43:33.053 --> 01:43:40.599]  Well, if you actually read what the Deimos Group and the CFR, the Trilateral Commission, say in the year 2020, that is their endgame.
[01:43:40.599 --> 01:43:41.300]  That is their goal.
[01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:49.485]  So we're talking about a Hunger Games type scenario here run by very, very, very ruthless people who see us as chattel.
[01:43:49.485 --> 01:43:53.948]  They're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy and Communist China as their model.
[01:43:53.948 --> 01:43:55.009]  We must reject it now.
[01:43:55.640 --> 01:43:57.702]  Stand back and stand by.
[01:43:57.702 --> 01:44:04.647]  During our Save America InfoWars money bond sale, we have all your favorite products up to 60% off plus free shipping.
[01:44:04.647 --> 01:44:10.512]  In order to help maximize our coverage of this historic election, we need your support during this crucial time.
[01:44:10.512 --> 01:44:14.776]  We have our vitamin D supplement Winter Sun Plus at 25% off.
[01:44:14.776 --> 01:44:20.060]  Winter Sun Plus works as a defense against attacks on your immune system, which will be great during the coming winter months.
[01:44:20.060 --> 01:44:20.661]  I don't know.
[01:44:36.914 --> 01:44:41.856]  All shirts in our apparel collection are currently set at the answers to $19.84, which is $17.76.
[01:44:41.856 --> 01:44:46.578]  And we also have Prostagard and Ultimate Fish Oil back in stock.
[01:44:46.578 --> 01:44:55.402]  So whether you're looking to stock up or thinking of adding something new to your daily routine, be sure to check out these deep discounts and more at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:44:57.534 --> 01:45:00.016]  2020ElectionsCenter.com.
[01:45:00.016 --> 01:45:02.717]  Just type it in one time and you've got it saved right there in your browser.
[01:45:02.717 --> 01:45:17.005]  And then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple platforms, but most importantly, via text message, email, or by word of mouth because they have banned the links to ban.video.
[01:45:17.005 --> 01:45:25.549]  But 2020ElectionsCenter.com is a clone of the site, the exact same links, the exact same videos where you can comment, you can share them, everything.
[01:45:25.549 --> 01:45:26.090]  The system
[01:45:27.050 --> 01:45:31.773]  He's censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[01:45:31.773 --> 01:45:36.616]  Trump has finally figured this out and says he's going to take action once re-elected against big tech.
[01:45:36.616 --> 01:45:38.116]  I mean, he's moderating the situation.
[01:45:38.116 --> 01:45:42.579]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry because he has to take an action.
[01:45:42.579 --> 01:45:53.405]  We the people are taking action now, and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com, and checking out the new, redesigned InfoWars.com and sharing that link.
[01:45:53.405 --> 01:45:54.706]  Oh, that really upsets them.
[01:45:54.706 --> 01:45:55.226]  Oh, yeah.
[01:45:56.966 --> 01:45:59.467]  Alex Jones here with a very important announcement.
[01:45:59.467 --> 01:46:01.909]  Everyone knows we need to be self-sufficient.
[01:46:01.909 --> 01:46:07.512]  Everyone with half a brain knows you need to have storable food that's high quality, nutritious, and lasts a long time.
[01:46:07.512 --> 01:46:08.993]  We've got the best sponsor.
[01:46:08.993 --> 01:46:10.274]  We've got the food.
[01:46:10.274 --> 01:46:16.117]  They're ready to ship it to you, but they're going to have to go up on prices in the next few months because of the shortages that have begun.
[01:46:16.437 --> 01:46:17.898]  They have the food on hand.
[01:46:17.898 --> 01:46:22.422]  They're ready to ship it out within a week to a week and a half, but not for much longer.
[01:46:22.422 --> 01:46:26.425]  So they are allowing us this last time big deal.
[01:46:26.425 --> 01:46:28.207]  It's been extended three days.
[01:46:28.207 --> 01:46:32.250]  Specials on top of their biggest specials ever at preparewithalex.com.
[01:46:33.171 --> 01:46:37.893]  PrepareWithAlex.com has even better deals than InfoWareStore.com.
[01:46:37.893 --> 01:46:44.296]  We're their biggest distributor, so contractually, we have to sell at the same price that they sell at the distributors do, which is already a great deal.
[01:46:44.296 --> 01:46:51.219]  But at PrepareWithAlex.com, they're able to do a promotion on one year, six months, and three months supplies.
[01:46:51.219 --> 01:46:54.020]  $600 off on a year, and it goes from there.
[01:46:54.020 --> 01:46:59.963]  Go to PrepareWithAlex.com.
[01:46:59.963 --> 01:47:02.584]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:09.629 --> 01:47:13.349]  Let the good times roll.
[01:47:13.349 --> 01:47:17.531]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:47:17.531 --> 01:47:21.091]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:21.091 --> 01:47:25.953]  Let them wash.
[01:47:25.953 --> 01:47:27.233]  Let them brush.
[01:47:27.233 --> 01:47:30.654]  Drop and roll hair.
[01:47:30.654 --> 01:47:33.895]  They say brush, then he says wash, and that's fine.
[01:47:33.895 --> 01:47:34.155]  You know,
[01:47:35.486 --> 01:47:39.869]  When I'm being attacked, when I'm being lied about, the only judge I've got is God.
[01:47:39.869 --> 01:47:43.132]  And almost always, it's not even a real attack.
[01:47:43.132 --> 01:47:46.194]  So I just stay on target and just ignore the attacks.
[01:47:46.194 --> 01:47:54.000]  To the point of, the enemy cannot stand it, because you're my judge, as viewers and listeners, and you keep us on air.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:48:02.266]  And I almost said this earlier, and then I got depressed reading another article, I didn't do it, about one African town of like 50,000, where 3,000 children starved to death last month.
[01:48:05.976 --> 01:48:07.256]  I can't be vitriolic.
[01:48:07.256 --> 01:48:13.479]  Hey, the UN admits they're murdering everybody!
[01:48:13.479 --> 01:48:14.499]  It's sick.
[01:48:14.499 --> 01:48:17.120]  It's sick.
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:19.261]  And it's going to come back on us unless we do something about it.
[01:48:19.261 --> 01:48:23.963]  I mean, I feel the spiritual danger of this.
[01:48:23.963 --> 01:48:25.083]  I'm not doing this as a hero.
[01:48:25.083 --> 01:48:28.764]  I'm doing this as survival, physically and spiritually.
[01:48:28.764 --> 01:48:30.785]  It isn't heroic to stand up to this.
[01:48:30.785 --> 01:48:31.866]  You better do it.
[01:48:31.866 --> 01:48:32.986]  And I know you understand that.
[01:48:34.206 --> 01:48:35.727]  But, look at this.
[01:48:35.727 --> 01:48:38.309]  I mean, I've talked a lot about this because I just run into it.
[01:48:38.309 --> 01:48:46.255]  The UN runs the Operation Stopping Child Trafficking and there's just thousands of articles of them caught all over the world, kidnapping kids, snuff filming them.
[01:48:46.255 --> 01:48:48.557]  I mean, the UN's the worst.
[01:48:48.557 --> 01:48:59.145]  The Sun newspaper reports Ghislaine Maxwell, the female pimp, she basically ran Epstein, pictured an anti-sex trafficking event
[01:49:00.489 --> 01:49:07.294]  Before arrest for providing pedo-epstey with young girls.
[01:49:07.294 --> 01:49:14.901]  And when I started really exposing this five years ago, I was exposing it 20 years ago, but I got some visits by folks that have been involved actually taking these groups out.
[01:49:14.901 --> 01:49:16.742]  They said, listen, Jones, you got to be careful.
[01:49:16.742 --> 01:49:18.784]  A lot of the groups saying they're fighting and running.
[01:49:18.784 --> 01:49:25.269]  And they exposed to me how the Amber Alert headlady changed her name and now runs it.
[01:49:25.269 --> 01:49:28.051]  But she got convicted of shipping kids out of Haiti.
[01:49:28.051 --> 01:49:30.133]  A bunch of them disappeared, some dead.
[01:49:34.389 --> 01:49:40.275]  So there she is, Ghislaine Maxwell, at the event for kidnapped children.
[01:49:40.275 --> 01:49:42.878]  This is sick.
[01:49:42.878 --> 01:49:43.478]  This is sick.
[01:49:43.478 --> 01:49:47.362]  And that ties into all this other news.
[01:49:47.362 --> 01:49:54.410]  FBI agent who found Wiener laptop with Clinton emails says FBI leadership ordered him to erase his findings.
[01:49:56.872 --> 01:50:02.857]  And we know that General Flynn and other lawyers have seen, and talked to lawyers that have seen it, and talked to the cops that saw it.
[01:50:02.857 --> 01:50:19.349]  I remember back four years ago during the campaign, four years ago plus, about four years and a month ago, about two months before the election, I was talking to people that were with the state police and stuff, man.
[01:50:19.349 --> 01:50:23.812]  Did you know that three of the five contacts are dead?
[01:50:23.812 --> 01:50:24.533]  And they're children!
[01:50:26.136 --> 01:50:33.502]  Oh, it's always a heroin overdose.
[01:50:33.502 --> 01:50:35.744]  Something like 10 of the 12 cops are dead.
[01:50:35.744 --> 01:50:37.866]  I mean, by the way, I'm not just up here saying that.
[01:50:37.866 --> 01:50:39.607]  Like, these are real people I talk to.
[01:50:39.607 --> 01:50:40.348]  They're dead!
[01:50:44.738 --> 01:50:46.079]  People ask, why are you still on air?
[01:50:46.079 --> 01:50:49.081]  It's like Jim Garrison, the DA in New Orleans.
[01:50:49.081 --> 01:50:51.563]  Famously told the media, he said, I stay in the spotlight.
[01:50:51.563 --> 01:50:52.523]  I'm prominent.
[01:50:52.523 --> 01:50:53.884]  It's the only reason I'm alive.
[01:50:53.884 --> 01:50:56.046]  Wolves don't come into the flame, the fire.
[01:50:56.046 --> 01:50:59.408]  They get you when you're out taking a piss in the woods.
[01:50:59.408 --> 01:51:00.549]  That's when the tiger gets you.
[01:51:00.549 --> 01:51:01.610]  That's when the bear gets you.
[01:51:01.610 --> 01:51:02.711]  That's when the wolf gets you.
[01:51:02.711 --> 01:51:05.933]  It's when you're out there at night, away from the fire.
[01:51:05.933 --> 01:51:07.254]  The light keeps you safe.
[01:51:09.096 --> 01:51:10.596]  I'm riding around in the lights right now.
[01:51:10.596 --> 01:51:12.237]  I just pray to Jesus to keep me safe.
[01:51:12.237 --> 01:51:13.817]  But if they want to take me, I'm not scared.
[01:51:13.817 --> 01:51:15.537]  And they hate the fact that I'm not scared.
[01:51:15.537 --> 01:51:17.358]  I don't say it that tough to people.
[01:51:17.358 --> 01:51:18.978]  It's not, that's not, no, that, no, no, no.
[01:51:18.978 --> 01:51:19.878]  No, no, no.
[01:51:19.878 --> 01:51:22.278]  It's not, oh no, you can do that too.
[01:51:22.278 --> 01:51:25.459]  Trust in Jesus and stop carrying what happens to your body.
[01:51:25.459 --> 01:51:27.319]  You're going to die anyways.
[01:51:27.319 --> 01:51:30.100]  And like dying is just like falling off a bicycle.
[01:51:30.100 --> 01:51:32.760]  You hit the ground, you're dead, you're gone.
[01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:34.681]  It's not big folks.
[01:51:34.681 --> 01:51:35.561]  As soon as you die,
[01:51:37.193 --> 01:51:38.294]  You're gonna laugh at this later.
[01:51:38.294 --> 01:51:39.834]  You're gonna have eternity.
[01:51:39.834 --> 01:51:43.236]  Time's not gonna matter anymore.
[01:51:43.236 --> 01:51:44.377]  Think about that.
[01:51:44.377 --> 01:51:46.518]  Stop giving Satan power.
[01:51:46.518 --> 01:51:47.539]  Stop caring.
[01:51:47.539 --> 01:51:48.579]  Don't commit suicide.
[01:51:48.579 --> 01:51:49.840]  Your life is precious.
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:51.481]  Stay here and do good work.
[01:51:51.481 --> 01:51:53.202]  Your life belongs to God.
[01:51:53.202 --> 01:51:54.943]  But stop caring if you die.
[01:51:54.943 --> 01:51:56.904]  See, I'm the opposite of suicidal.
[01:51:56.904 --> 01:51:58.424]  I love my life.
[01:51:58.424 --> 01:52:02.026]  I love beer and food and my family and everything.
[01:52:02.026 --> 01:52:02.987]  I love life.
[01:52:02.987 --> 01:52:04.868]  I love it so much that I'll give it up right now.
[01:52:06.445 --> 01:52:11.028]  Because I won't sell one person out for Satan.
[01:52:11.028 --> 01:52:17.632]  I won't sell one person out for another hundred years of life, another thousand years of life, because it's a scam!
[01:52:17.632 --> 01:52:18.712]  It's a lie!
[01:52:18.712 --> 01:52:20.894]  I was already given eternal life!
[01:52:20.894 --> 01:52:30.959]  I was already created and put on this planet in a test by the Supreme Being, and I have that connection, and I know that, and I choose that, and I am above Satan.
[01:52:30.959 --> 01:52:31.840]  Get behind me, Satan.
[01:52:35.589 --> 01:52:38.271]  But let's hit some of the positiveness right now.
[01:52:38.271 --> 01:52:43.676]  Trump urges Attorney General Barr to indict Obama, Biden and Hillary.
[01:52:43.676 --> 01:52:49.200]  You notice Barr, Trump said this Thursday, Barr came out Friday and said, we will not before the election.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:50.541]  He's a swamp creature.
[01:52:50.541 --> 01:52:53.083]  He doesn't want a war.
[01:52:53.083 --> 01:52:54.024]  There's already a war.
[01:52:54.024 --> 01:52:55.585]  I don't think Barr's bad.
[01:52:55.585 --> 01:52:57.507]  He just thinks Trump is too aggressive.
[01:52:57.507 --> 01:52:59.168]  No, this is what we elected.
[01:52:59.168 --> 01:52:59.889]  This is what we want.
[01:53:02.435 --> 01:53:04.996]  Trump chewed into Pompeo, said release emails.
[01:53:04.996 --> 01:53:06.776]  They released like half of them yesterday.
[01:53:06.776 --> 01:53:07.816]  No media coverage.
[01:53:07.816 --> 01:53:08.777]  We've been plowing through them.
[01:53:08.777 --> 01:53:11.797]  There's tens of thousands of them.
[01:53:11.797 --> 01:53:14.038]  Trump tells Iran, go ahead and attack somebody.
[01:53:14.038 --> 01:53:15.378]  We'll F you up.
[01:53:15.378 --> 01:53:17.739]  He said that because no president ever used that language.
[01:53:17.739 --> 01:53:19.059]  He wants them to know he's serious.
[01:53:19.059 --> 01:53:22.420]  Let's play a few of those clubs right now.
[01:53:22.420 --> 01:53:22.720]  Right.
[01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:24.760]  And Iran knows that and they've been put on notice.
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:31.822]  If you f*** around with us, if you do something bad to us, we are going to do things to you that have never been done before.
[01:53:33.152 --> 01:53:38.196]  They're in the State Department, but Mike Pompeo has been unable to get them out, which is very sad.
[01:53:38.196 --> 01:53:41.439]  Actually, I'm not happy about him for that reason.
[01:53:41.439 --> 01:53:42.500]  He was unable to get them out.
[01:53:42.500 --> 01:53:43.020]  I don't know why.
[01:53:43.020 --> 01:53:44.621]  You're running the State Department, you get them out.
[01:53:44.621 --> 01:53:46.923]  Forget about the fact that they were classified.
[01:53:46.923 --> 01:53:47.824]  Let's go.
[01:53:47.824 --> 01:53:52.068]  Maybe Mike Pompeo finally finds them, okay?
[01:53:52.068 --> 01:53:53.809]  So notice, Trump is doing what you gotta do.
[01:53:53.809 --> 01:53:55.390]  He's on the warpath.
[01:53:55.390 --> 01:53:57.272]  He's done with 20-something days out.
[01:53:57.272 --> 01:53:58.373]  He's on the attack.
[01:53:58.373 --> 01:54:00.855]  We should all be on the attack peacefully, but with the truth.
[01:54:02.338 --> 01:54:15.701]  And stop letting leftists waddle up and dictate to us that we're racist or we're bad when they're the ones supporting Chinese death camps for Muslims, Christians, and Buddhists, and when they're the ones that support pedophilia.
[01:54:15.701 --> 01:54:18.102]  Stop being afraid of the left.
[01:54:18.102 --> 01:54:24.643]  Stop being afraid of their bad housekeeping seal of approval.
[01:54:24.643 --> 01:54:28.544]  If you don't have the devil and the world and the left after you,
[01:54:29.838 --> 01:54:33.380]  I can tell you right now, like the Bible says, God's going to say, I don't know you.
[01:54:33.380 --> 01:54:34.821]  What does Christ say?
[01:54:34.821 --> 01:54:39.543]  He who is with me is against he who has control of the world.
[01:54:39.543 --> 01:54:45.747]  You will be persecuted in my name, but you will be blessed.
[01:54:45.747 --> 01:54:53.731]  But you first must be persecuted, and those that are steadfast will be given eternal life.
[01:54:55.660 --> 01:55:04.606]  I mean, you don't think all of our souls, all of our bandwidth, all of who we are, is going to get life with God.
[01:55:04.606 --> 01:55:08.289]  We're not going to get like a song catalog.
[01:55:08.289 --> 01:55:12.352]  You don't think God's going to keep us unless we're a good song.
[01:55:12.352 --> 01:55:16.935]  And listen, don't worry, those of you that don't want God, you get eternal life too.
[01:55:18.171 --> 01:55:20.873]  You get to spend your time with each other.
[01:55:20.873 --> 01:55:22.794]  I mean, that sounds like hell to me.
[01:55:22.794 --> 01:55:29.639]  You get to go to your SJW parasite palace and you get to be with each other forever.
[01:55:29.639 --> 01:55:33.001]  Listen, Newtonian physics show it.
[01:55:33.001 --> 01:55:34.863]  Einsteinian physics show it.
[01:55:34.863 --> 01:55:38.585]  Max Planck's physics show it.
[01:55:38.585 --> 01:55:40.787]  Quantum mechanics show it.
[01:55:40.787 --> 01:55:42.908]  And nobody that's a top man petition doesn't believe in God.
[01:55:42.908 --> 01:55:44.189]  They all go, oh my God, this is God.
[01:55:46.886 --> 01:55:48.009]  You gotta come to grips with that.
[01:55:48.009 --> 01:55:50.274]  God's real.
[01:55:50.274 --> 01:55:56.768]  And you gotta decide which side you're on because people that serve evil are crazy.
[01:55:57.998 --> 01:56:03.941]  They are going against God and God's math because they want to be God.
[01:56:03.941 --> 01:56:24.790]  Instead of you're part of what God expressed and that's your place in the universe, these idiots go, no, men are women and women are men and we're going to overturn everything and we're going to make a giant 5,000 foot red tree that stinks horribly to quote Time Bandits.
[01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:27.431]  And you're like, well, why wasn't there a 5,000 foot tree that stunk horribly?
[01:56:28.715 --> 01:56:30.296]  Because there's no point in it.
[01:56:30.296 --> 01:56:33.459]  It's like, why do we have thousands of species of parrots?
[01:56:33.459 --> 01:56:35.780]  Let's have laser beams day one.
[01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:37.542]  That's not how God operates.
[01:56:37.542 --> 01:56:40.764]  You don't get laser beams day one.
[01:56:40.764 --> 01:56:51.212]  You've got to first prove that you know how to put your socks on, your boots on, and build something big and strong and good that helps others.
[01:56:51.212 --> 01:56:53.133]  You have to be godly.
[01:56:53.133 --> 01:56:54.174]  You have to build.
[01:56:54.174 --> 01:56:56.836]  You can't be giving the keys of the universe for no reason.
[01:56:58.462 --> 01:56:59.342]  I'm out of time.
[01:56:59.342 --> 01:57:01.223]  I really appreciate the crew coming in tonight.
[01:57:01.223 --> 01:57:13.309]  It's such a big victory that the head UN envoy of the COVID Global Task Force came out and said the lockdown's killing people and needs to stop and that the economic shutdown is going to murder tons of people.
[01:57:13.309 --> 01:57:16.930]  Whether it's to cover his butt or whether the guy has a soul, whatever it is, it's the truth.
[01:57:16.930 --> 01:57:18.591]  And it's a big devastating victory.
[01:57:18.591 --> 01:57:24.554]  So next time you see a libtard wearing a mask or bossing you around how holy they are, you can shove this up their globalist keister.
[01:57:25.695 --> 01:57:28.417]  Uh, but listen, I appreciate you all coming up.
[01:57:28.417 --> 01:57:31.960]  Owen Schroer and the rest of the A-Team have got Sunday Live.
[01:57:31.960 --> 01:57:36.564]  It's basically commercial-free, and it's coming up with your calls and a lot more.
[01:57:36.564 --> 01:57:39.506]  So spread those links and be part of the resistance.
