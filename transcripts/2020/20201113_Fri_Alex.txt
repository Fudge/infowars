[00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:06.564]  It is Friday, November 13th.
[00:00:06.564 --> 00:00:08.926]  The year is 2020.
[00:00:08.926 --> 00:00:11.048]  Open world government is being announced.
[00:00:11.048 --> 00:00:13.631]  UN concentration camps are being publicly announced.
[00:00:13.631 --> 00:00:15.813]  We will break all the information now.
[00:00:15.813 --> 00:00:16.994]  Spread the word, Paul Reveres.
[00:00:16.994 --> 00:00:17.635]  This is not a drill.
[00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:26.024]  The hypocrisy of the left continues its criminal path toward completing the bidding of the New World Order.
[00:00:26.024 --> 00:00:34.987]  The World Federalist Association, or WFA, is one of the largest organizations that openly promote world government.
[00:00:34.987 --> 00:00:42.730]  1993, the WFA honored an editor for Time Magazine for an essay he had written entitled, The Birth of a Global Nation.
[00:00:49.706 --> 00:00:58.513]  And we are in the midst of one of the historic global transformations that is going to eventually lead to a new world order.
[00:00:58.513 --> 00:01:03.117]  The shape of that we don't know at this point, but we know the processes that are underway.
[00:01:03.117 --> 00:01:12.224]  The affirmative task we have now is to actually create a new world order.
[00:01:12.224 --> 00:01:13.565]  It's overwhelming our interest.
[00:01:15.032 --> 00:01:17.075]  That China prosper.
[00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:19.698]  That we have to level the playing field.
[00:01:19.698 --> 00:01:32.634]  I believe we, and particularly you, your class, has an incredible window of opportunity to lead in shaping a new world order for the 21st century.
[00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:50.791]  Democracy, freedom, openness that we cherish is under threat from within and from without by the siren call of this phony nationalism and populism and xenophobia that exists in many Western democracies today.
[00:01:50.791 --> 00:01:52.532]  All has changed.
[00:01:52.532 --> 00:01:53.372]  Changed utterly.
[00:01:54.693 --> 00:02:00.935]  In the last 15 years, and a terrible beauty has been born.
[00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:22.300]  As the Washington Examiner explains, just four years after the Obama administration authorized the secret surveillance of Michael Flynn for his communications with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, Ben Rhodes has boasted that Joe Biden is already talking to foreign leaders while another president rules the White House.
[00:02:22.908 --> 00:02:28.253]  Ready to congratulate you and congratulate Kamala Harris for this election.
[00:02:28.253 --> 00:02:40.022]  This, of course, violates the Logan Act, but Biden isn't wasting any time kneeling to his foreign overlords to dismantle everything President Trump did to protect the United States.
[00:02:40.282 --> 00:02:55.670]  And Mr. McCabe, yesterday on MSNBC, Ben Rhodes, the former Deputy National Security Advisor to President Obama, said that foreign leaders are already having conversations with Joe Biden, quote, talking about the agenda they're going to pursue January 20th.
[00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:00.012]  Mr. McCabe, based on that testimony, do you believe Joe Biden is violating the Logan Act?
[00:03:02.884 --> 00:03:05.085]  I'm not aware of Ben Rhodes' statements.
[00:03:05.085 --> 00:03:12.887]  He is talking with foreign leaders and it doesn't violate the Logan Act because the Logan Act is unconstitutional, which is why it's never been used to prosecute anyone.
[00:03:12.887 --> 00:03:18.589]  You authorized using it to go after General Flynn as part of a political persecution.
[00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:19.549]  I can give you the answer.
[00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:22.070]  Hell no, Joe Biden is not violating the Logan Act.
[00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:31.353]  The reason you won't say it is because that was your flimsy political basis to go after a decorated war hero because you disagreed politically with President Trump.
[00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:42.073]  Biden will reverse travel restrictions from countries sponsoring terrorism like Libya, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Yemen, and Iran.
[00:03:42.073 --> 00:03:46.095]  Biden also seeks to re-enter the Iranian nuclear deal.
[00:03:46.095 --> 00:03:48.796]  Biden plans to re-institute DACA.
[00:03:48.796 --> 00:03:54.599]  And Biden will also rejoin the Paris Climate Accord and resume funding for the World Health Organization.
[00:03:54.839 --> 00:04:04.308]  Of course, these are all initiatives by the Bilderberg Cartel promoting the disintegration of United States sovereignty in favor of their New World Order.
[00:04:04.308 --> 00:04:16.560]  About 140 participants this year, including the Chief Executive of Google, the Chancellor of this country, and the former head of the CIA-turned-executive for the private equity firm KKR.
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.723]  They're here at this event.
[00:04:19.723 --> 00:04:23.387]  If you've never heard of the Bilderberg Conference, don't be worried.
[00:04:23.387 --> 00:04:25.269]  I've been in the news business for about two decades.
[00:04:25.269 --> 00:04:26.130]  I'd never heard of it.
[00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.754]  That's because the organizers don't really want you to know about it.
[00:04:29.754 --> 00:04:32.297]  It is very secret, a very guarded affair.
[00:04:32.637 --> 00:04:40.988]  If Joe Biden does steal the Oval Office, he will face a country where at least half of the population despises him.
[00:04:40.988 --> 00:04:45.073]  Where a movement will exponentially grow against his occupation.
[00:04:45.073 --> 00:04:49.318]  Fertile ground for a false flag blamed on patriots.
[00:04:49.318 --> 00:04:50.460]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:04:51.874 --> 00:04:53.615]  Ladies and gentlemen, stay with us.
[00:04:53.615 --> 00:04:54.575]  Spread the word now.
[00:04:54.575 --> 00:04:56.055]  We are now in the new world order.
[00:04:56.055 --> 00:04:56.976]  We are fighting for our lives.
[00:04:56.976 --> 00:04:58.656]  It's only going to get worse from here unless you fight back.
[00:04:58.656 --> 00:05:00.737]  America is in crisis.
[00:05:00.737 --> 00:05:05.598]  Emergency lockdown 2 is coming under Biden.
[00:05:05.598 --> 00:05:06.979]  Support him for the fighting.
[00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:11.120]  It's total economic collapse and Biden's martial law disguised as lockdown 2.

[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.163]  These are things that are absolutely elemental to what you and your body
[00:05:37.483 --> 00:05:38.984]  You have to have to live.
[00:05:38.984 --> 00:05:43.107]  But regardless, buying these products from us funds the InfoWars, which is a 360 win.

[00:05:51.452 --> 00:05:52.633]  Again, I salute you and thank you all.
[00:05:52.633 --> 00:05:53.594]  The toll-free number is 888-253-3139.
[00:05:53.594 --> 00:05:56.096]  Please take action today in our emergency zone.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.422]  I'm good.
[00:06:29.874 --> 00:06:34.975]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are standing at the historic crossroads.
[00:06:34.975 --> 00:06:40.196]  And we are now passing out of the crossroad into a path of absolute hell on earth.
[00:06:40.196 --> 00:06:43.297]  Concentration camps, forced inoculations, and mass death.
[00:06:59.858 --> 00:07:01.218]  We are still at the crossroads.
[00:07:01.218 --> 00:07:04.519]  We still have a chance to go down another path.
[00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:14.221]  But if Trump cannot defeat this communist, globalist takeover, we are being sucked into the black hole vortex.
[00:07:14.221 --> 00:07:15.181]  Now, we have all the proof.
[00:07:15.181 --> 00:07:16.001]  It's all public.
[00:07:16.001 --> 00:07:19.462]  It's all hiding in plain view.
[00:07:19.462 --> 00:07:24.423]  And we all have to get very conscious about this.
[00:07:26.724 --> 00:07:33.827]  And understand that we're not in the normal, incremental, globalist takeover anymore that's already been horrible.
[00:07:33.827 --> 00:07:41.369]  Everything you've seen has been probing and conditioning and a readying process for what is now about to unfold.
[00:07:41.369 --> 00:07:48.572]  And I want to lay out for you at the bottom of the hour, as best I can, what is now going to unfold.
[00:07:48.572 --> 00:07:51.793]  The headline for the show today is a shocking headline.
[00:07:51.793 --> 00:07:52.713]  It's totally true.
[00:07:52.713 --> 00:07:53.633]  We have all the admissions.
[00:07:53.633 --> 00:07:54.274]  We have the U.N.
[00:07:54.274 --> 00:07:54.654]  saying it.
[00:07:55.623 --> 00:08:12.914]  We have them preparing it, now we have them implementing it, and we have the Democrats, the Communists, the Socialists, the labor parties of the world, all singing from the exact same sheets of music, with big tech enforcing it, along with mainstream corporate enemy, the people media.
[00:08:12.914 --> 00:08:22.860]  And the mainstream is authoritarianism, AI surveillance, social credit scores, children being taken from their parents by the state, forced inoculations,
[00:08:24.286 --> 00:08:27.688]  Medical passports to even have a job or leave your house.
[00:08:27.688 --> 00:08:33.051]  And then when you refuse to take the vaccine, you will be taken to an emergency camp.
[00:08:33.051 --> 00:08:34.552]  And many people will never be seen again.
[00:08:34.552 --> 00:08:36.593]  They're going to claim you died in the camp.
[00:08:36.593 --> 00:08:37.754]  They're going to inject you.
[00:08:37.754 --> 00:08:40.716]  They're going to innovate you and murder you.
[00:08:40.716 --> 00:08:41.857]  That is their plan.
[00:08:41.857 --> 00:08:43.177]  And the documents are out.
[00:08:43.177 --> 00:08:45.759]  So this is all the smoke screen cover.
[00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:48.741]  That's why suddenly you see massive fraud.
[00:08:49.983 --> 00:08:51.964]  Suddenly you see massive criminal activity.
[00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:55.446]  Everything you already witnessed is now turned up tenfold.
[00:08:55.446 --> 00:09:07.434]  And this morning I was sent a video of a doctor doing a online TV podcast answering listeners' questions.
[00:09:07.434 --> 00:09:15.519]  And he's talking about a document from six months ago when the Labour Party of Canada, and it's a confirmed document, I went and pulled it up in Reuters,
[00:09:16.971 --> 00:09:22.574]  We're talking about how the big lockdown's coming, how there's going to be exponential cases because of testing, which they already know, it's how it's set up.
[00:09:22.574 --> 00:09:24.695]  Everyone's going to end up getting COVID.
[00:09:24.695 --> 00:09:26.356]  It's designed to reinfect.
[00:09:26.356 --> 00:09:27.977]  We're all suspects.
[00:09:27.977 --> 00:09:35.181]  They can divide the public against each other, set up the secret police, the contact tracers, and give the leftists all badges and guns.
[00:09:35.181 --> 00:09:37.362]  That's why they're in the process of overthrowing the police.
[00:09:37.362 --> 00:09:38.943]  They're not getting rid of the police.
[00:09:38.943 --> 00:09:41.804]  You're about to be in a real police state.
[00:09:41.804 --> 00:09:46.307]  Everything you saw in the worst parts of Australia, run by leftist mayors under the UN command,
[00:09:48.078 --> 00:09:54.081]  And paid by the Communist Chinese government, one mayor over a billion dollars, in Australia.
[00:09:54.081 --> 00:09:57.523]  It's now been duplicated in Europe, the UK, and now here.
[00:09:57.523 --> 00:10:03.926]  The only presidents really fighting this are in Eastern Europe, and in Brazil, and the United States, and they're all under incredible attack.
[00:10:03.926 --> 00:10:08.168]  But Bolsonaro and Trump are absolute brigades.
[00:10:08.168 --> 00:10:12.130]  They are fortresses against this, and that's why they're under such attack.
[00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:13.310]  This is a very serious time.
[00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.171]  Everybody understand something?
[00:10:15.202 --> 00:10:16.683]  You don't get out of this by submitting.
[00:10:16.683 --> 00:10:18.103]  You don't get out of this by being scared.
[00:10:18.103 --> 00:10:20.684]  You don't get out of this by going along with them.
[00:10:20.684 --> 00:10:23.105]  They're coming for everyone.
[00:10:23.105 --> 00:10:25.105]  They're going to wipe out the third world.
[00:10:25.105 --> 00:10:26.546]  This is only phase one.
[00:10:26.546 --> 00:10:29.047]  Once you've gone under lockdown for about two or three years,
[00:10:30.222 --> 00:10:31.963]  Then the real bioweapons get released.
[00:10:31.963 --> 00:10:33.864]  I've told you this for decades.
[00:10:33.864 --> 00:10:35.885]  Gates said it a few months ago.
[00:10:35.885 --> 00:10:37.806]  He said, this is just a drill.
[00:10:37.806 --> 00:10:39.887]  The real thing's coming from terrorists.
[00:10:39.887 --> 00:10:47.011]  And he and Colbert began to have a visual, satanic type of gleeful orgasm.
[00:10:47.011 --> 00:10:48.451]  We have their battle plans.
[00:10:48.451 --> 00:10:49.832]  We know what they're doing.
[00:10:49.832 --> 00:10:53.474]  I know this has always sounded extreme and horrible.
[00:10:53.474 --> 00:10:54.935]  But it's the truth.
[00:10:54.935 --> 00:10:55.095]  Now,
[00:10:56.397 --> 00:10:58.259]  That's all coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:10:58.259 --> 00:10:58.940]  We have some video.
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:00.321]  I'm going to show you the Reuters articles.
[00:11:00.321 --> 00:11:06.347]  I'm going to show you local videos out of French Quebec, Montreal.
[00:11:06.347 --> 00:11:12.713]  And I'm going to show you the health department head saying, we're coming in your house, forcibly testing you, even if no one's sick.
[00:11:12.713 --> 00:11:14.234]  We're taking your children.
[00:11:14.234 --> 00:11:17.958]  If anyone is sick, we're going to separate your family.
[00:11:17.958 --> 00:11:18.539]  Now understand that.
[00:11:19.568 --> 00:11:21.349]  And remember, it's never going to go away.
[00:11:21.349 --> 00:11:29.774]  When people resist going to the camps, next year they're going to say, see, COVID didn't go away because you resisted and didn't go to the camps and take your shots.
[00:11:29.774 --> 00:11:30.715]  That's how the rollout works.
[00:11:30.715 --> 00:11:32.136]  Oh, you didn't wear your mask right.
[00:11:32.136 --> 00:11:34.177]  The lockdown wasn't long enough.
[00:11:34.177 --> 00:11:36.018]  Oh, you didn't submit enough.
[00:11:36.018 --> 00:11:39.540]  And then now here we are already into the next cycle.
[00:11:39.540 --> 00:11:40.801]  Okay?
[00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:42.682]  Here we are already into the next beginning of the next year.
[00:11:42.682 --> 00:11:45.344]  10 months into this, they're launching their new operation.
[00:11:45.344 --> 00:11:47.085]  Not in January, but in November.
[00:11:47.952 --> 00:11:50.734]  On the 5th of November when they launched it all over the world, the U.N.
[00:11:50.734 --> 00:12:00.401]  announcement that you're going to take the inoculations, you're going to be taken from your family, your business is not essential, the police are coming to watch you, they're backed up by leftist social workers.
[00:12:00.401 --> 00:12:03.663]  And they talk in these labor documents what the U.N.
[00:12:03.663 --> 00:12:04.383]  talks about.
[00:12:04.383 --> 00:12:05.324]  It's all just from the U.N.
[00:12:05.324 --> 00:12:12.049]  down, saying we started the big cities, we show everyone on TV that it's normal, we normalize it.
[00:12:12.944 --> 00:12:14.405]  It's how the communists took over Russia.
[00:12:14.405 --> 00:12:16.367]  They only had Moscow for a couple of years.
[00:12:16.367 --> 00:12:21.492]  Then they show you it's normal in the newsreels, on the radio, and now on the TV and the internet.
[00:12:21.492 --> 00:12:22.473]  Everyone else is blocked.
[00:12:22.473 --> 00:12:30.460]  And as we told you what happened, the media is asking, the independent media, oh is it true suddenly people can't send stop the steal videos on their iPhones?
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.562]  Oh suddenly people can't do instant messenger.
[00:12:32.562 --> 00:12:33.323]  Is it censorship?
[00:12:35.128 --> 00:12:42.486]  They announced last year on CNN that they were going to start blocking instant messages and text messages and now they're saying they're going to be monitoring you live time.
[00:12:42.486 --> 00:12:43.208]  The networks are.
[00:12:44.261 --> 00:12:49.645]  The big telecoms for what you're saying over the phone and cutting your phone off if you speak improperly.
[00:12:49.645 --> 00:12:55.188]  That's why they're making everyone stay at home so they can monitor everything over the Skype, over the Zoom, over the phones.
[00:12:55.188 --> 00:13:00.032]  This is AI, machine learning, forcing all of us into it.
[00:13:00.032 --> 00:13:03.694]  You know, like in the original Tron, when he wants all the little programs to be merged to him?
[00:13:03.694 --> 00:13:09.678]  And they're all being thrown in, they're all, I mean, that's the metaphor for tyranny.
[00:13:09.678 --> 00:13:13.741]  They're forcing everyone onto the phones, everyone onto the computers to live
[00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:20.336]  Which then forces everything over to robots and computers and automation so that it can actually take over.
[00:13:20.336 --> 00:13:23.720]  So we're having our legs cut out from under us, our voices taken away.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.986]  This isn't just, oh liberals that mean well and woke folks that went a little too far and ha ha ha.
[00:13:28.986 --> 00:13:30.548]  This is an incremental program.
[00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:46.534]  Where they change the Overton window and where they're always, again, pushing what's acceptable to narrow and narrower fields while they turn their rabble into a group of authoritarians that are there to bully us into submission.
[00:13:46.534 --> 00:13:48.454]  Now, thank God we still have a Constitution.
[00:13:48.454 --> 00:13:57.616]  That's why federal and state courts have ruled, and there was another ruling today against the Democrats, that they're not allowed to have these lockdowns, no matter what Biden says or what anybody says.
[00:13:57.616 --> 00:13:59.317]  But they just don't care.
[00:13:59.317 --> 00:14:00.797]  When the courts tell them they can't do this,
[00:14:02.227 --> 00:14:11.212]  When the courts pull this, pull the Constitution out, then the left just says, we don't care.
[00:14:11.212 --> 00:14:12.012]  We are the cities.
[00:14:12.012 --> 00:14:12.793]  We are the states.
[00:14:12.793 --> 00:14:13.653]  We are the bureaucrats.
[00:14:13.653 --> 00:14:15.034]  We are the businesses.
[00:14:15.034 --> 00:14:18.016]  We are in charge, and we're not budging.
[00:14:18.016 --> 00:14:25.960]  So it's a form of siege, of sabotage, of civil disobedience.
[00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:31.589]  This is civil disobedience, asymmetrical warfare.
[00:14:31.589 --> 00:14:39.135]  Sabotage comes from the French word of putting your sandal in the gears at a factory.
[00:14:39.135 --> 00:14:48.543]  And literally, because workers would get tired of working 18 hours a day during the start of the Industrial Revolution, and they would just throw their shoes into the machine.
[00:14:48.543 --> 00:14:49.824]  Sabotage.
[00:14:49.824 --> 00:14:53.206]  Putting your sandal into the machine.
[00:14:53.206 --> 00:14:55.028]  And so, but this is the big bankers.
[00:14:55.028 --> 00:14:56.108]  This is the robber barons.
[00:14:57.059 --> 00:15:05.845]  Who didn't know how to deal with people sabotaging them, so they built a system to control us, where they sabotage us, bring us to our knees, and hold us hostage.
[00:15:05.845 --> 00:15:08.127]  And they call it a lockdown.
[00:15:08.127 --> 00:15:14.892]  A term developed in the United States for when the people get unruly, when there's a riot, they learn, don't just punish the people that start it.
[00:15:15.956 --> 00:15:18.377]  Lock the whole prison down for a week or two.
[00:15:18.377 --> 00:15:21.558]  Don't let folks come out of their cells, make them eat in their cells.
[00:15:21.558 --> 00:15:22.538]  Don't let them go lift weights.
[00:15:22.538 --> 00:15:23.818]  Don't let them go work.
[00:15:23.818 --> 00:15:29.660]  Don't let them be a custodian and go mow the lawn of the state capitol or whatever.
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:30.880]  Make you stay in your house.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:32.521]  You're under lockdown.
[00:15:32.521 --> 00:15:34.461]  This was just baby training the last eight months.
[00:15:34.461 --> 00:15:39.623]  Now they're going to bring out what you saw in Australia, what you saw in Spain, and they admit that's the model.
[00:15:39.623 --> 00:15:43.564]  And they're coming with their special police political units to your house.
[00:15:44.164 --> 00:15:48.868]  And they are going to drag you out and they are going to take you to a facility in this phase.
[00:15:48.868 --> 00:15:52.730]  The next year, they're going to take you and kill you with a intubation.
[00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:56.473]  The new execution systems aren't guillotines, they're ventilators.
[00:15:56.473 --> 00:15:59.495]  Election 2020 is here, and whether Trump wins or loses,
[00:16:00.436 --> 00:16:11.600]  We have all won by exposing the communist Chinese, by exposing the globalists, by exposing the pedophile rings, by exposing the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:16.201]  Now I'm personally a Christian and I believe in God and I know God's real and I've experienced it in my life.
[00:16:16.201 --> 00:16:21.443]  But even if you don't believe in God, it's important to recognize that there is good in this world, there is evil.
[00:16:21.443 --> 00:16:24.724]  And there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing bad.
[00:16:25.584 --> 00:16:25.704]  Yes.
[00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:44.174]  Alex Jones here with an important message to all of our listeners and viewers.
[00:16:44.174 --> 00:16:46.275]  I want to thank you for your support over the years.
[00:16:46.275 --> 00:16:48.396]  I want to thank you for having skin in the game.
[00:17:03.542 --> 00:17:06.266]  No one has had more skin in the game than our president.
[00:17:06.266 --> 00:17:07.288]  And he needs our prayers.
[00:17:07.288 --> 00:17:08.230]  He needs our support.
[00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:10.072]  He is the president.
[00:17:10.072 --> 00:17:11.835]  Secretary of State Pompeo understands.
[00:17:11.835 --> 00:17:18.426]  That's why he said yesterday, there will be a smooth transition from this Trump administration into the next Trump administration.
[00:17:18.766 --> 00:17:23.990]  Because in all the major states where they're still counting, they are gaining ground.
[00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:36.178]  That is President Trump, Republican Party, the American people, the populace, the patriots, the enemy, the Democrats, backed by the shy comms, backed by the European Union, backed by Hollywood, backed by the left, the blue cities, the blue states.
[00:17:36.178 --> 00:17:38.980]  They are in a rage trying to gaslight us.
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:40.821]  Keep calling Biden president elect.
[00:17:40.821 --> 00:17:41.381]  He's not.
[00:17:41.381 --> 00:17:46.985]  President has to concede and or all of the states have to certify the vote, which hasn't happened yet.
[00:17:46.985 --> 00:17:48.326]  And then you have to have the electors
[00:17:48.806 --> 00:17:51.110]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:18:23.769 --> 00:18:29.271]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:18:29.271 --> 00:18:36.593]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:18:36.593 --> 00:18:39.254]  Alright, we come to you live from Washington, D.C.
[00:18:40.871 --> 00:18:41.872]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:18:41.872 --> 00:18:43.112]  I'm very, very honored to be here.
[00:18:43.112 --> 00:18:46.634]  We have the big historic march tomorrow.
[00:18:46.634 --> 00:18:48.616]  We caught Antifa on the way here.
[00:18:48.616 --> 00:18:54.279]  They were following us from Florida up into Virginia and now into D.C.
[00:18:54.279 --> 00:18:59.902]  posing as patriots and handing out white supremacist literature.
[00:18:59.902 --> 00:19:02.443]  So that's going to be their main mission tomorrow.
[00:19:02.443 --> 00:19:07.366]  We actually caught them on video red-handed and we actually intercepted their communications.
[00:19:09.059 --> 00:19:10.880]  Through a source.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.461]  And they threw a mole.
[00:19:13.461 --> 00:19:14.181]  I'll sell them.
[00:19:14.181 --> 00:19:15.381]  We've infiltrated them.
[00:19:15.381 --> 00:19:20.503]  And they're planning to dress like MAGA folks at the march tomorrow.
[00:19:20.503 --> 00:19:29.347]  They'll be wearing their red baseball caps backwards and wearing camouflage pants is how they're dressing.
[00:19:29.347 --> 00:19:31.267]  So we've got that to look forward to.
[00:19:31.267 --> 00:19:35.189]  This is the true scum who wants to deny us third dimensional access to the streets.
[00:19:36.977 --> 00:19:51.561]  You've got big tech everywhere, admittedly blocking everyone now online and then now over their phones and many text messages and email services not letting people send stop, steal or videos exposing election fraud.
[00:19:51.561 --> 00:19:55.042]  Because you can't have all these election officials coming out and saying they saw fraud.
[00:19:55.042 --> 00:20:01.703]  You can't have the racists that are going back to Republicans all over the country as they go in and look at the machines, everything flipping against Trump.
[00:20:01.703 --> 00:20:02.724]  They can't have this coming out.
[00:20:02.724 --> 00:20:03.724]  They have to just keep saying
[00:20:05.299 --> 00:20:08.402]  To everyone over and over and over again, it is a hoax.
[00:20:08.402 --> 00:20:10.423]  There is no election fraud.
[00:20:10.423 --> 00:20:13.246]  Even though Georgia officials looked about and said, yeah, we found a bunch of fraud.
[00:20:13.246 --> 00:20:16.769]  And there's thousands of dead people they've already found in Michigan and Pennsylvania.
[00:20:16.769 --> 00:20:23.054]  And we know the ballots were sent out so they could stuff the deck before and stuff it after.
[00:20:23.054 --> 00:20:26.918]  And we have the mathematicians that have looked at it and they tell you how it's two companies, Dominion.
[00:20:28.650 --> 00:20:45.679]  And, of course, Staple Street, they're having the, quote, anomalies and the patches that private companies came in and put on the day before the election in these battleground states and all the weird food trucks and other vehicles showing up middle of the night that had swipe guards after everything's closed and going in with the big boxes of ballots.
[00:20:45.679 --> 00:20:46.940]  This was insane.
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:48.661]  The globalists are in full panic mode.
[00:20:48.661 --> 00:20:50.082]  Yes, it's bad they're moving against us.
[00:20:50.082 --> 00:20:51.723]  Yes, it's bad they're totally criminal.
[00:20:51.723 --> 00:20:53.804]  Yes, it's bad they've taken the mask off, taken the gloves off.
[00:20:55.663 --> 00:21:00.465]  But this is because there was a landslide for Trump.
[00:21:00.465 --> 00:21:02.886]  They tried to manipulate the polls, but they still couldn't.
[00:21:02.886 --> 00:21:09.349]  Real internal polling shows as much as 50% of black males now supporting President Trump.
[00:21:09.349 --> 00:21:12.050]  That's five times whatever it was.
[00:21:12.050 --> 00:21:12.910]  Exit polls showed 36%.
[00:21:12.910 --> 00:21:15.971]  That's triple whatever it was.
[00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:17.792]  Black females, about 35%.
[00:21:17.792 --> 00:21:20.313]  That's about triple what it used to be.
[00:21:20.313 --> 00:21:22.034]  Same thing with Hispanics, it's even higher.
[00:21:22.034 --> 00:21:24.695]  There is a total awakening to what the Democrats do.
[00:21:25.646 --> 00:21:28.267]  They don't want a big tent for America.
[00:21:28.267 --> 00:21:41.193]  They want people to hate America and believe it's bad and evil, so that all the brown people that live here, that built this country, and the brown people that are coming to the country, hate their chance to be in a capitalist society and successful.
[00:21:41.193 --> 00:21:43.354]  And that's why it's total, absolute race baiting.
[00:21:43.354 --> 00:21:51.838]  That's why the Attorney General of Michigan, who's a Southern Poverty Law Center operative, is saying, it's racist to recount the votes, don't do it.
[00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:56.947]  It's why they're harassing all the lawyers and their families from law firms.
[00:21:56.947 --> 00:21:59.508]  And even the New York Times is saying, you shouldn't have law firms.
[00:21:59.508 --> 00:22:02.429]  You shouldn't be able to have representation and go, look at these things.
[00:22:02.429 --> 00:22:03.470]  That's the system.
[00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:07.152]  And the Democrats said they were going to contest all of this.
[00:22:07.152 --> 00:22:14.595]  So, again, if it was just old-fashioned Democrats earlier in the game who were just corrupt, I wouldn't be so concerned.
[00:22:14.595 --> 00:22:17.616]  We can make it out of that.
[00:22:17.616 --> 00:22:20.257]  The globalists want to break this country once and for all.
[00:22:20.257 --> 00:22:21.458]  I'm going to break it down next segment.
[00:22:22.915 --> 00:22:35.600]  But this is the admitted plan to only ratchet down the tourniquet, to only tighten up the noose around our necks every successive point as all of this unfolds.
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:40.162]  Now I want to play you a clip of Joe Biden conceding the election.
[00:22:40.162 --> 00:22:41.143]  That's right.
[00:22:41.143 --> 00:22:45.044]  Here's Joe Biden conceding the presidential election.
[00:22:45.044 --> 00:22:45.745]  This is a real video.
[00:22:45.745 --> 00:22:45.985]  Here it is.
[00:22:47.352 --> 00:22:50.834]  There is one less candidate in the race for the presidency tonight.
[00:22:50.834 --> 00:23:03.520]  Delaware Senator Joseph Biden dropped out of the hunt today, saying the disclosures about his plagiarism in law school and his exaggerations about his academic record made it impossible for him to continue.
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:09.162]  I do it with incredible reluctance, and it makes me angry.
[00:23:09.162 --> 00:23:16.446]  I'm angry with myself for having been put in the position, put myself in the position, of having to make this choice.
[00:23:17.608 --> 00:23:23.791]  The Delaware Democrat is the second candidate to be forced from the race by questions of character and integrity.
[00:23:23.791 --> 00:23:26.593]  Gary Hart dropped out earlier this year.
[00:23:26.593 --> 00:23:33.717]  Meantime, with Joseph Biden out of the race, Colorado Congresswoman Pat Schroeder may soon fill the spot vacated by the Delaware Senator.
[00:23:37.076 --> 00:23:38.717]  That was him, you know, decades ago.
[00:23:38.717 --> 00:23:40.698]  This is a disgraceful creature.
[00:23:40.698 --> 00:23:41.598]  That's why they put him in.
[00:23:41.598 --> 00:23:43.879]  This is the type of trash they have to get.
[00:23:43.879 --> 00:23:49.941]  Senile, doesn't know what planet he's on, an enemy of this country, who spent 47 years selling us out.
[00:23:49.941 --> 00:23:53.703]  And America did not reject President Trump.
[00:23:53.703 --> 00:24:03.147]  He didn't get triple the black votes and double the Hispanic votes he got.
[00:24:03.147 --> 00:24:05.388]  And he got record number four years ago.
[00:24:06.471 --> 00:24:13.895]  It's like five times the black male vote now than what other Republicans ever got.
[00:24:13.895 --> 00:24:19.178]  I mean, that's all you need to know right there, folks, is they lost control of people's minds.
[00:24:19.178 --> 00:24:24.381]  And I've talked to a ton of black folks here in D.C.
[00:24:24.381 --> 00:24:27.443]  and it's a black city.
[00:24:27.443 --> 00:24:29.584]  And I just ask them, hey, you like Trump?
[00:24:29.584 --> 00:24:30.684]  Absolutely, I like Trump.
[00:24:30.684 --> 00:24:34.807]  I'm driving down the road, I see black people all over the place wearing the Trump office, Trump gear.
[00:24:35.711 --> 00:24:37.852]  And they are just so pissed, man.
[00:24:37.852 --> 00:24:39.554]  So good luck, New World Order.
[00:24:39.554 --> 00:24:40.854]  Good luck.
[00:24:40.854 --> 00:24:45.998]  Because you may get some idiots buying into your BS and all your leftists running around preaching race and division.
[00:24:45.998 --> 00:24:47.579]  People see through your crap.
[00:24:47.579 --> 00:24:52.242]  And now when Biden takes the prosperity away, he's able to get in and puts us into a depression and starts rounding folks up.
[00:24:52.242 --> 00:24:52.942]  Oh, and guess what?
[00:24:52.942 --> 00:24:56.164]  Biden's got something really good for black folks.
[00:24:56.164 --> 00:24:59.026]  Ezekiel Emanuel, the same one that says kill people at 75.
[00:24:59.026 --> 00:24:59.547]  Death panels.
[00:24:59.547 --> 00:25:01.448]  His people are in the news.
[00:25:01.448 --> 00:25:03.789]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:04.450]  It's a big article.
[00:25:05.856 --> 00:25:07.857]  You can link right to the statements.
[00:25:07.857 --> 00:25:12.078]  It's an actual news article originally, and it's all right there.
[00:25:12.078 --> 00:25:14.099]  Vax the blacks.
[00:25:14.099 --> 00:25:22.702]  Joe Biden's COVID-19 task force recommends withholding food stamps and rent assistance from those who refuse coronavirus vaccines.
[00:25:22.702 --> 00:25:27.784]  And they specifically say blacks really need it because they're twice as likely to get COVID.
[00:25:27.784 --> 00:25:30.785]  Yeah, because black people need about three times the sun as a white person.
[00:25:31.545 --> 00:25:39.392]  People that aren't along around the sun have white skins, they absorb it and get vitamin D. Blacks from the equator, where they would get too much sun, so they got skin to reflect it.
[00:25:39.392 --> 00:25:51.982]  But when blacks live in northern clines, they tend to get more diseases and all sorts of problems because of vitamin D. So if you really want a virtue signal for real and help black folks, I walk around and tell black people.
[00:25:51.982 --> 00:25:55.325]  I just walk up and say, hey, they want to kill you, they don't want you to have vitamin D.
[00:25:56.363 --> 00:25:57.884]  And you need to get vitamin D if you want to stop COVID.
[00:25:57.884 --> 00:25:58.504]  And they go, what do you mean?
[00:25:58.504 --> 00:26:02.386]  And I go, well, you know, you've got black skin and you don't absorb as much light.
[00:26:02.386 --> 00:26:03.587]  And you need it.
[00:26:03.587 --> 00:26:04.087]  Look into it.
[00:26:04.087 --> 00:26:05.288]  A lot of black folks go, yeah, I know that.
[00:26:05.288 --> 00:26:05.648]  You're right.
[00:26:05.648 --> 00:26:08.309]  I was telling my mom that.
[00:26:08.309 --> 00:26:10.150]  Just look, you want to beat the enemy?
[00:26:10.150 --> 00:26:12.091]  Fauci and these murderers, they want to kill us all.
[00:26:12.091 --> 00:26:14.933]  But they got a special lichen for black folks.
[00:26:14.933 --> 00:26:15.994]  They're killing them in Africa.
[00:26:15.994 --> 00:26:20.996]  And by the way, the black folks here, they know Gates is running operations in Africa.
[00:26:20.996 --> 00:26:22.057]  So you globals are in a lot of trouble.
[00:26:23.607 --> 00:26:24.247]  Makes me sick.
[00:26:24.247 --> 00:26:26.128]  Makes me physically ill to watch this unfold.
[00:26:26.128 --> 00:26:30.449]  Another thing is, it's a stick in the eye of the enemy to keep us on air.
[00:26:30.449 --> 00:26:31.449]  I need your financial support.
[00:26:31.449 --> 00:26:32.390]  I love you and I appreciate it.
[00:26:32.390 --> 00:26:33.990]  We've got supplements you already need.
[00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:35.010]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.391]  We've got the fish oil.
[00:26:36.391 --> 00:26:38.331]  It's got all the D3 and the rest of it.
[00:26:38.331 --> 00:26:39.732]  We've got the DNA Force Plus.
[00:26:39.732 --> 00:26:40.892]  It's so good for your cells.
[00:26:40.892 --> 00:26:41.893]  You take in one product, it's that.
[00:26:41.893 --> 00:26:42.393]  We have X2.
[00:26:42.393 --> 00:26:44.393]  The big sale's got to end soon.
[00:26:44.393 --> 00:26:46.534]  It's the Emergency Stop Lockdown 2.
[00:26:46.534 --> 00:26:47.174]  Save the Republic.
[00:26:47.174 --> 00:26:49.355]  Stop the steel sale at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:26:49.355 --> 00:26:51.595]  Free shipping and more, but it's got to end in a couple days.
[00:26:51.595 --> 00:26:52.536]  InfoWareStore.com.
[00:26:52.536 --> 00:26:53.176]  We'll be right back.
[00:26:54.542 --> 00:26:55.703]  Remember Hillary Clinton?
[00:26:55.703 --> 00:26:56.623]  Remember Pelosi?
[00:26:56.623 --> 00:26:57.584]  Remember Bill Clinton?
[00:26:57.584 --> 00:26:59.005]  Remember Obama?
[00:26:59.005 --> 00:27:03.307]  All of them said we are not going to concede if there's a red mirage.
[00:27:03.307 --> 00:27:07.710]  We believe it's going to look like Trump's going to win in a landslide because they have the internal polls.
[00:27:07.710 --> 00:27:08.911]  And indeed, Trump won.
[00:27:09.671 --> 00:27:12.533]  Most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin.
[00:27:12.533 --> 00:27:19.079]  And when he was set to win the other ones, they froze these seven states on election night.
[00:27:19.079 --> 00:27:21.621]  And then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had.
[00:27:21.621 --> 00:27:22.542]  This is completely transparent.
[00:27:22.542 --> 00:27:25.644]  So when they say that he is president-elect, he's not.
[00:27:25.644 --> 00:27:26.565]  Trump has not conceded.
[00:27:26.565 --> 00:27:28.667]  None of the states have certified the vote.
[00:27:28.667 --> 00:27:30.869]  And now all these investigations have been opened up.
[00:27:30.869 --> 00:27:36.493]  And avalanches, mountains, oceans of election fraud has come out and already been documented.
[00:27:36.493 --> 00:27:37.074]  And in Georgia,
[00:27:37.794 --> 00:27:40.276]  Officials are on record saying we've already found fraud.
[00:27:40.276 --> 00:27:42.557]  So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in.
[00:27:42.557 --> 00:27:46.500]  They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time, because the last hoax failed.
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:50.642]  But now, this is the mother of all hoaxes, and if they get away with this, it's the end of America.
[00:27:50.642 --> 00:27:52.804]  As we know it, we will beat Venezuela.
[00:27:52.804 --> 00:27:53.584]  Infowars.com
[00:27:54.725 --> 00:27:58.989]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed.
[00:27:58.989 --> 00:28:00.190]  And why is that?
[00:28:00.190 --> 00:28:07.998]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree-like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds.
[00:28:07.998 --> 00:28:12.482]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[00:28:12.482 --> 00:28:13.763]  They didn't know why.
[00:28:13.763 --> 00:28:19.529]  Well, with modern science we know it's one of the purest, cleanest organic forms of selenium.
[00:28:20.109 --> 00:28:31.594]  We have BioTrue Selenium, sold out for months, back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com at 50% off, store-wide free shipping, and triple patriot points.
[00:28:31.594 --> 00:28:41.118]  BioTrue Selenium at InfoWarsStore.com is an amazing product, and it's even more amazing in that it funds our operation.
[00:28:41.118 --> 00:28:43.599]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it.
[00:28:43.599 --> 00:28:45.940]  It is an essential nutrient in the body
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:54.411]  You've absolutely have to have it's back in stock 50% off triple patriot points at Infowars.com and with free shipping.
[00:28:54.411 --> 00:28:58.936]  Introducing Infowars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[00:28:58.936 --> 00:29:01.480]  This is taken under the tongue.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.621]  It is pure turmeric.
[00:29:03.664 --> 00:29:12.867]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[00:29:12.867 --> 00:29:18.688]  This is absorbed under the tongue, into the bloodstream, and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[00:29:18.688 --> 00:29:20.849]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[00:29:21.309 --> 00:29:24.552]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[00:29:24.552 --> 00:29:26.393]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[00:29:26.393 --> 00:29:28.515]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[00:29:28.515 --> 00:29:30.696]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[00:29:30.696 --> 00:29:32.057]  Some like bodies better.
[00:29:32.057 --> 00:29:36.200]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.381]  And they fund the InfoWar.
[00:29:37.381 --> 00:29:42.005]  So get our new liquid turmeric extract exclusively at InfoWarStore.com today.

[00:29:57.532 --> 00:30:00.153]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:30:05.632 --> 00:30:06.233]  We've got it.
[00:30:06.233 --> 00:30:12.741]  This transmission is coming to you.
[00:30:12.741 --> 00:30:17.166]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:30:17.166 --> 00:30:22.813]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:30:29.767 --> 00:30:31.227]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:31.227 --> 00:30:33.688]  Thank you for joining me.
[00:30:33.688 --> 00:30:37.570]  I'm bringing you very, very grave information, and I know a lot of people are listening now.
[00:30:37.570 --> 00:30:38.650]  A lot more people are tuning in.
[00:30:38.650 --> 00:30:40.111]  They're paying a lot of attention to us.
[00:30:40.111 --> 00:30:44.013]  That's why we had to stay on air when they tried to silence us in the last few years.
[00:30:44.013 --> 00:30:48.014]  They were so scared of us because we had the blueprint of their takeover plan.
[00:30:48.014 --> 00:30:54.157]  That's why before they launched the COVID operation a year ago, they took in-game off of Amazon and many other platforms.
[00:30:55.239 --> 00:31:00.801]  And basically have the distributors, who are still selling in stores, stop restocking the DVDs.
[00:31:00.801 --> 00:31:03.481]  It's also taken off many other player services.
[00:31:03.481 --> 00:31:14.045]  Because in the film, we lay out how the UN and others say we're going to bring in planetary government using a real virus or the threat of a virus.
[00:31:14.045 --> 00:31:16.645]  And we know what COVID-19 is.
[00:31:16.645 --> 00:31:18.326]  If you go back to the H1N1 flu scare,
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:21.182]  Almost a decade ago.
[00:31:21.182 --> 00:31:25.229]  It later came out in white papers by pharmaceutical companies a year after that.
[00:31:25.229 --> 00:31:30.158]  A year before that, they created a simulant flu virus.
[00:31:31.434 --> 00:31:43.562]  That was a live flu virus that they claimed wasn't harmful that they could put in the regular vaccine so that they could quote track the spread of it and track how flu spread.
[00:31:43.562 --> 00:31:45.563]  That really wasn't what was going on.
[00:31:45.563 --> 00:31:51.747]  They had jacked into the RNA of the virus and it had a lot of mutagenic effects and cancer-causing effects.
[00:31:51.747 --> 00:31:53.348]  You can look that up.
[00:31:53.348 --> 00:32:00.092]  And so that's what they're doing with the vaccines is the vaccines are a cover for the Trojan horses they're putting in people just like, oh black folks we're gonna
[00:32:01.394 --> 00:32:03.715]  Give me a vaccine that's really live syphilis.
[00:32:03.715 --> 00:32:08.316]  But again, when they started coming out, they only focus on the black folks and people say, oh, it's just the black folks.
[00:32:08.316 --> 00:32:12.637]  No, it's everybody that was poor that they could target.
[00:32:12.637 --> 00:32:15.837]  So now, this is a giant planetary operation.
[00:32:15.837 --> 00:32:17.438]  Bill Gates has been thrown out of India.
[00:32:17.438 --> 00:32:18.818]  He's been thrown out of Tanzania.
[00:32:18.818 --> 00:32:20.139]  He's been thrown out of Kenya.
[00:32:20.139 --> 00:32:21.639]  He's been thrown out of over 20 countries.
[00:32:22.705 --> 00:32:25.067]  Because they caught him giving people cancer viruses.
[00:32:25.067 --> 00:32:27.349]  They caught him giving people HIV.
[00:32:27.349 --> 00:32:29.651]  They caught him giving people polio.
[00:32:29.651 --> 00:32:31.613]  And again, I'm on Joe Rogan three weeks ago.
[00:32:31.613 --> 00:32:39.620]  I go, Joe, AP reports that most of the polio cases are from the UN's own vaccine program paid for by Bill Gates.
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.201]  It's his specific vaccine.
[00:32:41.201 --> 00:32:43.723]  And Joe's like, there's no way that's true, man.
[00:32:43.723 --> 00:32:44.444]  Boom, pulls it right up.
[00:32:46.343 --> 00:32:48.528]  Because they don't even try to hide this now.
[00:32:48.528 --> 00:32:53.880]  So, when you're tuning in, I want everybody to understand, your life is over, as you know it, until you fight back.
[00:32:55.438 --> 00:32:59.641]  We need people every day surrounding the governor's mansion where Governor Abbott is.
[00:32:59.641 --> 00:33:02.203]  If he's in a restaurant eating, you don't go up and threaten him.
[00:33:02.203 --> 00:33:05.385]  You go up and you say, sir, we know you're being blackmailed.
[00:33:05.385 --> 00:33:06.686]  We know the lockdown's permanent.
[00:33:06.686 --> 00:33:07.586]  Be a leader and stop it.
[00:33:07.586 --> 00:33:09.347]  We need to start his recall.
[00:33:09.347 --> 00:33:10.308]  Okay?
[00:33:10.308 --> 00:33:15.491]  We need to see more state Supreme Courts and federal courts throw this out and say no.
[00:33:15.491 --> 00:33:17.433]  I know so many of you are in love with Amy Comey Barrett.
[00:33:17.433 --> 00:33:18.093]  I hope she's good.
[00:33:18.093 --> 00:33:20.575]  I hope she votes for Trump against the Supreme Court.
[00:33:20.575 --> 00:33:22.016]  But she's for lockdown.
[00:33:22.016 --> 00:33:23.597]  She's for far-fetched speculations.
[00:33:23.597 --> 00:33:24.197]  She supported a 1901
[00:33:31.043 --> 00:33:35.507]  That's what we need.
[00:33:35.507 --> 00:33:44.134]  But if we keep complying, if we keep rolling over, it's successive approximation of basic psychological operation.
[00:33:44.134 --> 00:33:47.658]  Now obviously, we all know this as listeners.
[00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:49.219]  We've got to get it out to others.
[00:33:49.219 --> 00:33:51.081]  We can't look at it and tell it's an incremental
[00:33:52.182 --> 00:33:53.043]  Fish trap.
[00:33:53.043 --> 00:34:04.513]  You know those fish traps where the hole looks like it's only so big, but once the fish gets in, it has a tendency to swim forward, and then it squeezes through, but won't go back through a hole that it sees as too small?
[00:34:04.513 --> 00:34:07.756]  It'll squeeze through it once it thinks it's trapped, and actually get trapped.
[00:34:07.756 --> 00:34:15.022]  But when it turns around and tries to leave, the hole's smaller, so even though it can still squeeze through, almost no species of fish will squeeze through.
[00:34:15.022 --> 00:34:16.583]  The globalists have studied us like fish.
[00:34:17.364 --> 00:34:31.652]  And they've had Stanford, they've had Yale, they've had Harvard, they've had Oxford, they've had Cambridge, all put out in the last year that years ago they did studies on how to make you accept lockdowns, how to make you accept forced evacuations, how to make you accept your children being taken from you.
[00:34:31.652 --> 00:34:33.253]  But that's just the takeover.
[00:34:33.253 --> 00:34:45.979]  Then they break the economy, put everyone on a universal income, and control every step of your life for that universal income you get, and now they have that giant mass of people that'll do whatever they're told for that universal income, and you are slaves.
[00:34:45.979 --> 00:34:46.620]  The chains are on.
[00:34:48.186 --> 00:34:56.391]  This is a systematic illegal program, and I don't want any offensive violence, but I see a lot of talk online, people saying, time to dust off the muskets.
[00:34:56.391 --> 00:35:01.894]  Here's the issue, existentially, and I'll give you these clips of the big news.
[00:35:01.894 --> 00:35:08.838]  Under common law, under common sense, you cannot come with experimental dangerous vaccines
[00:35:10.418 --> 00:35:14.642]  Whether they'd be safe or not, and they're not, they're deadly, and it's obviously the takeover.
[00:35:14.642 --> 00:35:20.267]  These people have liability protection, they have long histories of killing people with vaccines, they are eugenicists that want to depopulate you.
[00:35:20.267 --> 00:35:33.380]  When somebody says, I want to depopulate you, and he's spent hundreds of billions of dollars he got from big foundations and the robber barons to get control of the world health system, and most nation-state systems, he's been thrown out of over 20 countries, Gates has, but he's in another 140 or so.
[00:35:35.998 --> 00:35:52.074]  When you've got something of that magnitude going down, and he says he wants to do this, and it's what he comes out of, Cold Springs Harbor and the eugenics, and then he's coming, violating the Geneva Convention, violating the Nuremberg Code, violating international law.
[00:35:52.074 --> 00:35:58.400]  If the Nazis were coming to give you a deadly shot or take your kids away, you don't just have a right, you have a duty to fight them.
[00:35:59.241 --> 00:36:01.844]  So they've already shut down the communications almost everywhere.
[00:36:01.844 --> 00:36:02.584]  Now they're coming.
[00:36:02.584 --> 00:36:12.574]  Now they're going to beta test in Canada, and Europe in this round, and in California, and in New York, dragging people out of their homes, beating people up that don't wear masks, taking people's children away.
[00:36:12.574 --> 00:36:13.955]  The UN said that was the goal.
[00:36:13.955 --> 00:36:16.478]  It's already happened in Australia and Spain.
[00:36:16.478 --> 00:36:18.280]  Now it's happening in England.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:22.263]  And they're just normalizing that vans come, cops have guns, you disappear.
[00:36:23.063 --> 00:36:23.263]  I don't
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:49.802]  And the communist Chinese do this, and they put it down your lungs and they kill you.
[00:36:49.802 --> 00:36:52.083]  And they sit there and laugh at you while you're dying.
[00:36:52.083 --> 00:36:53.304]  And they turn it up way higher.
[00:36:53.304 --> 00:37:04.348]  In fact, a lot of the old folks in the blue city areas where they have these killer eugenics doctors, they're in cult bioethics boards like Ezekiel Emanuel, saying he wants to kill old people, he runs this.
[00:37:04.348 --> 00:37:07.189]  He hires for decades all these boards.
[00:37:07.189 --> 00:37:08.109]  These are psycho killers.
[00:37:09.830 --> 00:37:14.315]  Even the medical association said, why did you give people twice the pressure you're supposed to?
[00:37:14.315 --> 00:37:19.221]  And they're like, because they got to get kill numbers.
[00:37:19.221 --> 00:37:21.924]  So they're coming to kill you.
[00:37:21.924 --> 00:37:23.446]  They're coming to kill you.
[00:37:23.446 --> 00:37:25.068]  They're coming to kill you.
[00:37:25.068 --> 00:37:27.090]  And then they're like, oh, see death numbers.
[00:37:27.090 --> 00:37:28.071]  They're already beta tested.
[00:37:28.999 --> 00:37:30.320]  In the nursing homes.
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:32.121]  They already wouldn't let families in.
[00:37:32.121 --> 00:37:43.848]  Oh, you might have COVID, but if you have COVID, but we're healthy, asymptomatic, oh, we're going to bring you in to the nursing home where there's no sunlight and they eat crappy food to get half the death numbers in the country.
[00:37:43.848 --> 00:37:46.049]  So they're going to kill the old people.
[00:37:46.049 --> 00:37:46.830]  That's what COVID-19 is.
[00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:52.913]  That's why Ezekiel Emanuel is going to run the whole new system for Biden if he gets in.
[00:37:52.913 --> 00:37:55.775]  And that's why he's announcing, black folks, you want your welfare?
[00:37:55.775 --> 00:37:56.456]  You're going to take it.
[00:37:57.162 --> 00:38:00.486]  Poor white folks, poor black folks, you're going to take it.
[00:38:00.486 --> 00:38:03.949]  Old people, you can't come see your kids.
[00:38:03.949 --> 00:38:05.451]  Kids can't come see you.
[00:38:05.451 --> 00:38:09.075]  We're going to ship more people in and kill them.
[00:38:09.075 --> 00:38:12.278]  It's all a test to see if they can get away with not with guillotines.
[00:38:13.339 --> 00:38:16.201]  If they got guillotines out, you'd know you'd resist.
[00:38:16.201 --> 00:38:18.302]  They had guillotines in downtown D.C.
[00:38:18.302 --> 00:38:22.705]  chopping Trump's head off tomorrow, and chopping his family's head off, you'd rise up, we'd overthrow him.
[00:38:22.705 --> 00:38:32.311]  But it's not that, it's, oh, we're taking you to an emergency COVID center, and when you get to the emergency COVID center, you just disappear.
[00:38:32.311 --> 00:38:41.978]  And we already know it's been operating for six months in Canada, and the number of death statistics they're holding, but we know that the main deaths are happening in these centers.
[00:38:43.168 --> 00:38:46.990]  And they're beta testing on old people and on homeless who are run down.
[00:38:46.990 --> 00:38:49.851]  So at first to get the cops used to it, well, we take them to the center.
[00:38:49.851 --> 00:38:50.732]  They don't have any new process.
[00:38:50.732 --> 00:38:51.972]  No one knows who they are.
[00:38:51.972 --> 00:38:55.994]  They take them and then they have special doctors that believe they're saving the earth.
[00:38:55.994 --> 00:38:57.135]  Humans are bad.
[00:38:57.135 --> 00:38:58.555]  They're being paid money to do it.
[00:38:58.555 --> 00:39:01.217]  $3,000 extra here in the U.S.
[00:39:01.217 --> 00:39:02.517]  They're paid extra in Canada.
[00:39:02.517 --> 00:39:04.058]  These are very high paid doctors.
[00:39:04.058 --> 00:39:08.180]  Just like the organ harvesting doctors that keep baby comfortable.
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:09.621]  He says, mama doesn't want baby.
[00:39:09.621 --> 00:39:10.541]  We keep baby comfortable.
[00:39:10.541 --> 00:39:11.802]  We harvest organs.
[00:39:11.802 --> 00:39:12.362]  Governor Northam.
[00:39:13.829 --> 00:39:15.790]  And he's a baby harvester.
[00:39:15.790 --> 00:39:23.174]  And he's up there telling you, listen, police don't need to be involved, husband doesn't need to be involved, only the woman and the doctors.
[00:39:23.174 --> 00:39:28.216]  There should be at least two doctors in the room and we agree to say baby's not resuscitated.
[00:39:28.216 --> 00:39:29.737]  Now baby's still alive.
[00:39:29.737 --> 00:39:34.199]  Resuscitation means we don't say you're a viable life under eugenics, under bioethics.
[00:39:34.199 --> 00:39:40.182]  Then baby is taken and kept a week, two weeks, whatever, while they blood type it, get the organs ready for harvesting.
[00:39:40.862 --> 00:39:44.144]  And we're going to harvest, baby, they're going to harvest you.
[00:39:44.144 --> 00:39:48.065]  So, that's why we have a second amendment to defend ourselves, but this is it.
[00:39:48.065 --> 00:39:49.326]  They're coming for you and your family.
[00:39:49.326 --> 00:39:51.547]  They will murder you.
[00:39:51.547 --> 00:39:53.568]  They've got brainwashed nurses who don't even know what plans they're on.
[00:39:53.568 --> 00:39:55.269]  You know, something very sad is happening.
[00:39:55.269 --> 00:40:02.072]  It's very sad because it was all avoidable two and a half years ago when InfoWars got banned off of more than 60 major platforms.
[00:40:02.072 --> 00:40:03.393]  I warn everybody there was a precedent.
[00:40:04.073 --> 00:40:17.536]  For the upcoming presidential election and that they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship until effectively there was a total internet kill switch in place against conservatives, nationals and populists.
[00:40:17.536 --> 00:40:18.856]  And now that's happened.
[00:40:18.856 --> 00:40:32.339]  And then I told everybody that they would then start moving to arrest individuals that demonstrate and protest using a second COVID-19 lockdown and that Trump needed to get out front and fully repudiate COVID-19 as basically an overblown hoax.
[00:40:32.919 --> 00:40:39.943]  He started to do that the last few months of the campaign, but we have to understand that that's the pincer attack they're going to use.
[00:40:39.943 --> 00:40:48.727]  They're going to use Black Lives Matter and race war to stir up the American people and divide us, and they're going to use economic warfare, shutting down the economy, to try to control us.
[00:40:48.727 --> 00:40:53.529]  I hope people will listen now to my warnings, because I'm on air telling people what's coming next.
[00:40:53.529 --> 00:41:00.093]  The problem with social Darwinism is the so-called elites, the most cunning, smart bit of people,
[00:41:01.373 --> 00:41:04.314]  ...believe that chivalry doesn't exist anymore.
[00:41:04.314 --> 00:41:09.197]  They don't believe in being aristocrats, trying to hold up civilization and empower the people.
[00:41:09.197 --> 00:41:13.819]  And once the establishment has that predatory idea, civilization collapses very, very quickly.
[00:41:13.819 --> 00:41:19.061]  You can't treat the least of us like garbage and not treat your own family like that.
[00:41:19.061 --> 00:41:21.462]  And so it is this lack of empathy that's going to destroy us.
[00:41:22.851 --> 00:41:32.503]  The globalists can try to be heartless devil worshippers that commit rituals of all sorts of horrible crimes, try to get away from the humanity, but really, they can't escape the laws of the universe.
[00:41:32.503 --> 00:41:37.269]  They may train themselves to commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves, but...
[00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:43.613]  The repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and the very structure itself.
[00:41:43.613 --> 00:41:45.754]  Wealth is created by loving God.
[00:41:45.754 --> 00:41:47.955]  Wealth is created by having a connection to God.
[00:41:47.955 --> 00:41:50.736]  God is the source of all creation, all success, all power.
[00:41:50.736 --> 00:41:52.697]  If you deny that, you'll be destroyed.
[00:41:54.321 --> 00:41:56.802]  America is in crisis.
[00:41:56.802 --> 00:42:01.664]  Emergency lockdown 2 is coming under Biden.
[00:42:01.664 --> 00:42:07.926]  Support InfoWars, the fighting, it's total economic collapse and Biden's martial law disguised as lockdown 2.

[00:42:25.715 --> 00:42:29.998]  These are game-changing things that the globalists don't need to have.
[00:42:29.998 --> 00:42:35.062]  These are things that are absolutely elemental to what you and your body have to have to live.
[00:42:35.062 --> 00:42:39.425]  But regardless, buying these products from us funds the Info Wars, which is a 360 win.

[00:42:40.906 --> 00:42:42.808]  I want to ask you to redouble your efforts to spread the word.
[00:42:42.808 --> 00:42:44.509]  I want to ask you to buy the products.
[00:42:44.509 --> 00:42:47.491]  Nymphomorestore.com today, because without you, we won't be on the air.
[00:42:47.491 --> 00:42:48.852]  Again, I salute you and thank you all.
[00:42:48.852 --> 00:42:49.653]  The toll-free number is 888-253-3139.
[00:42:49.653 --> 00:42:54.157]  Please take action today in our emergency center.
[00:42:54.157 --> 00:43:05.686]  Look, we all know that CNN is the epitome of fake news, but there's a headline on their site today that says, there are disinformation groups and organizations saying Joe Biden is not president-elect.
[00:43:06.906 --> 00:43:15.452]  Well, on its face, he's not president-elect because the votes have not been certified by any of the 50 states.
[00:43:15.452 --> 00:43:18.995]  And counting is still going on, what, in seven of the states?
[00:43:18.995 --> 00:43:22.297]  And Trump is gaining ground in all but one of them.
[00:43:23.138 --> 00:43:32.425]  And then there's also going to be recounts, audits, and all the spot checks have already shown NASA fraud, but in comes the ace card, the ace of spades.
[00:43:32.425 --> 00:43:42.592]  Big Tech censorship is blocking not just the President, not just members of Congress, but tens of millions of Americans from even sharing local news stations confirming the fraud.
[00:43:42.592 --> 00:43:46.255]  This is a foreign-backed, multinational takeover of the United States.
[00:43:46.255 --> 00:43:48.076]  Trump is battling a Chinese-backed,
[00:43:48.997 --> 00:43:57.001]  New World Order system bent on keeping us locked down forever in an economic war and bringing us to our knees.
[00:43:57.001 --> 00:43:59.603]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:13.624 --> 00:44:18.026]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:44:18.026 --> 00:44:21.847]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:21.847 --> 00:44:30.891]  Alright, I want to be deadly straight with you and absolutely level with you a trillion percent, okay?
[00:44:30.891 --> 00:44:33.052]  I am not exaggerating about any of this.
[00:44:34.286 --> 00:44:37.088]  I know it sounds completely insane what I'm saying.
[00:44:37.088 --> 00:44:44.273]  I can prove every point of this in their own admissions, their own statements, their own preparation.
[00:44:44.273 --> 00:44:51.698]  But now we're 10 months into this global government, martial law, medical tyranny, fear machine takeover.
[00:44:53.004 --> 00:45:01.971]  And you've got archbishops saying it's a planetary new world order satanic takeover to kill you and your family and shut down the economy and start a third world.
[00:45:01.971 --> 00:45:02.972]  It's top scientists.
[00:45:02.972 --> 00:45:06.335]  It's thousands of prominent virologists, doctors, scientists.
[00:45:06.335 --> 00:45:08.917]  I just want to be clear.
[00:45:08.917 --> 00:45:15.402]  When I say that they have medical boards and special hospitals trained by Ezekiel Emanuel and others, this is on record.
[00:45:16.107 --> 00:45:18.008]  Okay, my dad used to own a hospital.
[00:45:18.008 --> 00:45:20.508]  My dad managed 200 dental offices at one time.
[00:45:20.508 --> 00:45:23.309]  My dad testified in the state legislature, okay?
[00:45:23.309 --> 00:45:27.291]  And so I grew up around medical management, alright?
[00:45:27.291 --> 00:45:31.492]  And my dad told me, he goes, there's certain hospitals in Dallas where they kill people and take their organs.
[00:45:32.978 --> 00:45:36.600]  Now, when I was 16 getting my driver's license, he said, don't sign the organ donor card.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.442]  There are certain hospitals in Dallas that kill people.
[00:45:39.442 --> 00:45:41.263]  I just thought it was crazy, but I still didn't sign it.
[00:45:41.263 --> 00:45:45.786]  Again, a few years later, 60 minutes back, went and did a good job.
[00:45:45.786 --> 00:45:54.572]  Talked about Dallas and Chicago, two specific cities, also Austin, killing people that could be saved for their organs.
[00:45:56.147 --> 00:45:59.349]  So it's certain hospitals, like anything, it's good and evil.
[00:45:59.349 --> 00:46:01.030]  Like you go to one Catholic church, it's good people.
[00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:02.871]  Go to another, it's run by child molesters.
[00:46:02.871 --> 00:46:05.053]  You go to one Baptist church, it's run by good people.
[00:46:05.053 --> 00:46:09.436]  Go to another, it's run by devil worshippers.
[00:46:09.436 --> 00:46:11.657]  Everything isn't what it seems.
[00:46:11.657 --> 00:46:15.400]  And so doctors are great people on average, like Dr. Ron Paul and so many others.
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.440]  And they have the Hippocratic Oath.
[00:46:17.591 --> 00:46:22.394]  People like Northam and people like Ezekiel have trained and created these bioethics boards.
[00:46:22.394 --> 00:46:27.938]  And they've gotten laws changed in New York and places where they can kill already born babies that are healthy.
[00:46:27.938 --> 00:46:29.219]  Now why do they want that?
[00:46:29.219 --> 00:46:32.541]  They don't want just the babies, they want you!
[00:46:32.541 --> 00:46:42.968]  So, the UN, with their Director of Global Crisis Response, we've played the clip of a bunch here, he said,
[00:46:44.642 --> 00:46:50.326]  Years ago, when the global pandemic hits and it's coming, so did Fauci, he said, we'll deal with Trump, there's a global pandemic coming.
[00:46:50.326 --> 00:46:52.748]  Trump didn't see that speech.
[00:46:52.748 --> 00:46:54.049]  Because Fauci was already there.
[00:46:54.049 --> 00:46:56.291]  People are like, why does Trump have Fauci?
[00:46:56.291 --> 00:46:58.913]  It's the whole bureaucracy.
[00:46:58.913 --> 00:47:04.417]  Fauci involved covering up what AIDS really was, what happened in Africa, he's been involved in all of it.
[00:47:04.417 --> 00:47:07.700]  He's been around longer than Gates in this.
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:10.082]  So if Gates is Darth Vader, he's Palpatine, okay?
[00:47:10.082 --> 00:47:12.644]  So, here's what I'm getting at.
[00:47:13.660 --> 00:47:24.302]  The UN recommended emergency centers be set up as prisons with special doctors and special staff for people that refuse to be tested or quarantined.
[00:47:24.302 --> 00:47:27.923]  So, like they've got special hospitals and special facilities.
[00:47:27.923 --> 00:47:31.743]  Like in New York, they have one hospital where more people died there than everywhere else in New York.
[00:47:31.743 --> 00:47:34.264]  Because that's where they're running the op.
[00:47:34.264 --> 00:47:37.425]  They're getting $53,000 for everybody they killed.
[00:47:37.425 --> 00:47:38.765]  I'm sorry, there's $2,000 extra you get.
[00:47:40.419 --> 00:47:42.040]  54,000 and change for one that kills.
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.241]  Sorry, it's a little bit extra.
[00:47:43.241 --> 00:47:45.202]  So, this is real.
[00:47:45.202 --> 00:47:46.322]  This has happened.
[00:47:46.322 --> 00:47:49.024]  This is for money at the low level.
[00:47:49.024 --> 00:48:01.710]  But creating these cadre corps of killers, assassins, they can then expand those cadre corps out and so the new system is not death by a firing squad.
[00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:02.471]  We need to create a meme.
[00:48:02.471 --> 00:48:03.791]  It's not firing squads.
[00:48:03.791 --> 00:48:05.652]  It's not guillotines.
[00:48:05.652 --> 00:48:06.413]  They don't hang you.
[00:48:07.403 --> 00:48:12.825]  They take you, and they intubate you, because that's the U.N.
[00:48:12.825 --> 00:48:14.185]  recommendation.
[00:48:14.185 --> 00:48:21.248]  If you have COVID, we stick a thing down your throat, down your airways, into your bronchia.
[00:48:21.248 --> 00:48:22.668]  And that's how they murder you.
[00:48:22.668 --> 00:48:24.649]  Now, that's the fast murder way.
[00:48:24.649 --> 00:48:30.811]  The slow murder is the vaccine, which is why you see the cancer rates up, and all the death, and all the disease, all the neurological problems, and that's in all the studies.
[00:48:32.031 --> 00:48:37.174]  So, in Africa, in places, they just come in and pay the village leaders to let us shoot up.
[00:48:37.174 --> 00:48:39.356]  People will give you half a million dollars.
[00:48:39.356 --> 00:48:42.678]  And the village leaders will stand up with machine guns and make a thousand people take it.
[00:48:42.678 --> 00:48:44.059]  And then, like, hundreds die the next day.
[00:48:44.059 --> 00:48:46.481]  You know, miscarriages, total death.
[00:48:46.481 --> 00:48:47.701]  It comes out in the local news.
[00:48:47.701 --> 00:48:49.683]  Well, now the villagers, when they see you in trucks, they just run.
[00:48:51.192 --> 00:48:52.413]  And they fight.
[00:48:52.413 --> 00:48:55.516]  And so the Africans now fight for their lives and they're having trouble.
[00:48:55.516 --> 00:49:03.763]  So now Bill Gates announced they're going to start shipping in free food, food aid that has live virus vaccine in the food.
[00:49:03.763 --> 00:49:08.308]  So everything being done to the Africans is now time for us.
[00:49:09.557 --> 00:49:12.920]  So when I tell you all of this, I want you to know we're not making this up.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:13.780]  Okay?
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:15.201]  I'm sorry it's this horrible.
[00:49:15.201 --> 00:49:18.364]  So at special hospitals, they're going to take political people they want.
[00:49:18.364 --> 00:49:24.429]  Oh, you went to this restaurant, gave us your QR code, or you know, gave us your, someone else in there had that.
[00:49:24.429 --> 00:49:26.390]  Then they come and say, sorry, we need to text you.
[00:49:26.390 --> 00:49:27.771]  Oh, it says you're positive.
[00:49:27.771 --> 00:49:29.132]  It's all fake.
[00:49:29.132 --> 00:49:32.415]  And they go, we need you to come with us.
[00:49:32.415 --> 00:49:33.396]  Now see in phase one,
[00:49:34.637 --> 00:49:36.258]  That we run it was just stay locked down.
[00:49:36.258 --> 00:49:36.798]  It's up to you.
[00:49:36.798 --> 00:49:38.079]  Everybody's kind of scared.
[00:49:38.079 --> 00:49:39.020]  We did it ourselves.
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:40.741]  Then phase two is what you already saw in Australia.
[00:49:40.741 --> 00:49:44.763]  They've already done phase two in Spain, where they come and threaten you.
[00:49:44.763 --> 00:49:45.683]  Your neighbor sees you out.
[00:49:45.683 --> 00:49:46.224]  They get money.
[00:49:46.224 --> 00:49:48.045]  You get taken away to a facility.
[00:49:48.045 --> 00:49:50.306]  Phase three, they're going to go, sorry, we just can't allow that.
[00:49:51.288 --> 00:49:55.670]  We're just creating a computer list of those that we think are dissenting against the lockdown.
[00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:59.892]  And that's the reason millions died of COVID, when they're really just gonna be killing you with ventilators.
[00:49:59.892 --> 00:50:02.353]  So that's why they're still going, we need ventilators!
[00:50:02.353 --> 00:50:06.975]  The New York mayor, the New York governor, because that's the murder weapon.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:08.960]  And again, the U.N.'
[00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:09.521]  's the boss.
[00:50:09.521 --> 00:50:11.682]  They say how to turn the air up.
[00:50:11.682 --> 00:50:12.663]  They say who to do it to.
[00:50:12.663 --> 00:50:17.145]  They say no family allowed in to the hospital or the nursing home so they can kill you.
[00:50:17.145 --> 00:50:23.149]  So they already made, in the U.S., the nursing homes the FEMA centers as a beta test.
[00:50:23.149 --> 00:50:25.190]  Now they're just going to move directly to FEMA centers.
[00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:26.751]  So let's go ahead and go back to October.
[00:50:26.751 --> 00:50:30.854]  Next hour I'm going to lay out the latest info, how to stop it, what we've got to do.
[00:50:35.029 --> 00:50:43.635]  Matt Hillier, out of Kingston, Canada, Member of Parliament, back on October 14th, talking about what was coming, now it's here.
[00:50:43.635 --> 00:50:46.177]  And again, they're just now going to Step 2.
[00:50:46.177 --> 00:50:48.139]  We're not going into Step 2 yet, but we will.
[00:50:48.139 --> 00:50:49.580]  This is all a laid out plan, here it is.
[00:50:51.073 --> 00:50:53.895]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[00:50:53.895 --> 00:50:55.816]  My question is to the Premier.
[00:50:55.816 --> 00:51:03.161]  In my supplemental question yesterday, I asked this government if the people of Ontario should prepare for internment camps.
[00:51:03.161 --> 00:51:17.471]  In September, the federal government posted a call for expressions of interest for contractors to supply, provide, and manage quarantine isolation camps throughout every province and every territory in Canada.
[00:51:17.471 --> 00:51:19.173]  These quarantine isolation camps
[00:51:20.225 --> 00:51:31.071]  However, are not limited to people with COVID, but provide a wide latitude for many people to be detained.
[00:51:31.071 --> 00:51:37.654]  Surely this government is aware of the intentions to build these isolation camps from coast to coast.
[00:51:37.654 --> 00:51:42.236]  And my question to the Premier is, how many of these camps will be built?
[00:51:42.236 --> 00:51:45.138]  And how many people does this government expect to detain?
[00:51:48.087 --> 00:51:48.787]  Thank you.
[00:51:48.787 --> 00:51:50.709]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[00:51:50.709 --> 00:52:01.937]  It is very true that when people leave the country and when they come back in, that the province is suggesting and in the federal government, in cooperation with the federal government, we are suggesting that people isolate themselves.
[00:52:01.937 --> 00:52:09.363]  That has been a practice that has been very successful, not only here in the province of Ontario, but across Canada and we will... Alright, that's enough of him.
[00:52:09.363 --> 00:52:10.684]  Shut him up.
[00:52:10.684 --> 00:52:13.967]  We're going to go through the actual documents when we start the next hour.
[00:52:13.967 --> 00:52:15.007]  But here it is in French.
[00:52:16.015 --> 00:52:16.455]  I don't know.
[00:52:39.679 --> 00:52:46.603]  Remember that Swedish couple was panicking and they come and she was organizing a demonstration and they arrested her.
[00:52:46.603 --> 00:52:47.243]  Her husband.
[00:52:47.243 --> 00:52:49.344]  They've never been seen again last time I heard.
[00:52:49.344 --> 00:52:50.665]  We need to check on them.
[00:52:50.665 --> 00:52:51.565]  Same thing in Australia.
[00:52:51.565 --> 00:52:53.306]  They've disappeared thousands of people.
[00:52:53.306 --> 00:52:55.387]  Members of city councils that said no.
[00:52:55.387 --> 00:52:56.948]  We're taking to military bases.
[00:52:56.948 --> 00:52:58.289]  Some were never seen again.
[00:52:59.696 --> 00:53:00.417]  See, that's the thing.
[00:53:00.417 --> 00:53:05.060]  We're used to being free in the US or Australia or the UK to a certain extent.
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:07.081]  We're all told, you know, it's cops killing black people.
[00:53:07.081 --> 00:53:08.442]  That's the big problem with police.
[00:53:08.442 --> 00:53:17.548]  No, it's leftist bureaucrats that are going out and grabbing everyone and now they're saying you can't go to a concert, you can't go to school unless you've had all the vaccines.
[00:53:17.548 --> 00:53:26.394]  You've got to have a government-issued phone, just like they have at the universities now in the US, that says you've got your digital passport, which also tracks you.
[00:53:27.446 --> 00:53:35.113]  And again, all that's just the police state takeover and the precedent of them being able to disappear anybody they want under you in command.
[00:53:35.113 --> 00:53:38.596]  That's the real issue is you in command, world government.
[00:53:38.596 --> 00:53:41.479]  The first world collapses, third world dies.
[00:53:41.479 --> 00:53:45.942]  And the Davos Group says in the Great Reset, in his book and in their own statements, go look it up.
[00:53:45.942 --> 00:53:47.904]  We've showed you the videos, we've shown you the articles.
[00:53:47.904 --> 00:53:50.727]  They say the third world is going to collapse because of COVID.
[00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:54.116]  No, it's the COVID lockdown.
[00:53:54.116 --> 00:53:58.838]  Hundreds of millions are going to starve to death, and they're going to flood us, and we've got to feed them now.
[00:53:58.838 --> 00:53:59.818]  But they're not really going to feed them.
[00:53:59.818 --> 00:54:05.880]  They're just going to bring in, they said 600 million people in the next 20 years in the U.S.
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:07.620]  because of COVID.
[00:54:07.620 --> 00:54:10.021]  250 million into France alone.
[00:54:10.021 --> 00:54:11.701]  France isn't even 100 million people.
[00:54:11.701 --> 00:54:13.442]  Did you just hear what I said?
[00:54:13.442 --> 00:54:17.683]  This is dystopia, hell, like you've never imagined.
[00:54:17.683 --> 00:54:18.463]  I'm going to explain it again.
[00:54:20.199 --> 00:54:22.860]  The track just snapped shut.
[00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:24.741]  Okay, and I'm not trying to scare you here.
[00:54:24.741 --> 00:54:26.282]  You're going to see all this happen.
[00:54:26.282 --> 00:54:29.343]  They're going to murder your neighbors with those damn ventilators.
[00:54:29.343 --> 00:54:31.524]  They're going to murder you if they can.
[00:54:31.524 --> 00:54:34.505]  And they're going to have ignorant people around them going, trust the science.
[00:54:34.505 --> 00:54:36.586]  The cops are like, well, I'll take you.
[00:54:36.586 --> 00:54:38.767]  We've got to get in their faces now.
[00:54:38.767 --> 00:54:41.148]  Lay it out before they roll out the next mode.
[00:54:41.148 --> 00:54:42.129]  That's our secret weapon.
[00:54:43.598 --> 00:54:48.963]  When President Trump said that the mainstream corporate media was the enemy of America, he really was telling the truth.
[00:54:48.963 --> 00:54:55.209]  They don't just work for the communist Chinese, and the globalists, and the EU, and the whole Hollywood, America-hating, God-hating crew.
[00:54:55.209 --> 00:55:04.638]  They literally say that they are in control of our minds, and believe that they do own us, and tell us who the president is, even though that's not in law.
[00:55:04.638 --> 00:55:08.761]  And they're just gaslighting the whole public over and over again, saying, Joe Biden is president-elect.
[00:55:09.645 --> 00:55:15.849]  Repeating it over and over again, like a brainwashing mantra, when it's up again to the state government to certify those votes.
[00:55:15.849 --> 00:55:17.089]  And those votes are being challenged.
[00:55:17.089 --> 00:55:18.730]  There's massive evidence of fraud.
[00:55:18.730 --> 00:55:21.672]  Again, this is so incredibly clear.
[00:55:21.672 --> 00:55:28.596]  Biden said, because he thought he was going to lose up front, that, oh, we're going to challenge the vote no matter what, until every vote's counted.
[00:55:28.596 --> 00:55:31.598]  Well, a lot of votes haven't been counted, and there's massive fraud being discovered.
[00:55:32.338 --> 00:55:35.721]  We're going to hold the course here because Joe Biden is a communist Chinese agent.
[00:55:35.721 --> 00:55:36.421]  He's a globalist.
[00:55:36.421 --> 00:55:37.582]  He wants carbon taxes.
[00:55:37.582 --> 00:55:41.865]  He will destroy this country by design to consolidate power and take control of us.
[00:55:41.865 --> 00:55:44.587]  This is war.
[00:55:44.587 --> 00:55:48.350]  Communist China has been fully open for business for more than six months.
[00:55:48.350 --> 00:55:53.494]  But the European Union and every other major Western nation is still under some form of lockdown.
[00:55:53.494 --> 00:56:00.720]  And the lockdowns are getting more intense and people are being told they're going to be arrested if they leave their houses, just like we've seen in Australia.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:04.842]  You see, the authoritarians want total control.
[00:56:04.842 --> 00:56:10.946]  And because they don't respect this, because the general public puts up with so much abuse, they're going for broke.
[00:56:10.946 --> 00:56:11.966]  Why shouldn't they?
[00:56:11.966 --> 00:56:13.907]  They never get in trouble for the big illegal wars.
[00:56:13.907 --> 00:56:16.229]  They never get in trouble for the Chinese slave camps.
[00:56:16.229 --> 00:56:19.911]  They never get in trouble for all the terrible exploitation in Africa.
[00:56:19.911 --> 00:56:23.333]  They never get in trouble for shipping fentanyl and other deadly drugs into our country.
[00:56:24.073 --> 00:56:27.114]  And so why shouldn't they go for broke?
[00:56:27.114 --> 00:56:29.815]  Because so many people are domesticated and they're soft.
[00:56:29.815 --> 00:56:31.355]  And they have Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:56:31.355 --> 00:56:32.956]  They love their abusers.
[00:56:32.956 --> 00:56:35.116]  They can't believe they're being lied to.
[00:56:35.116 --> 00:56:37.157]  They can't believe they're being conned.
[00:56:37.157 --> 00:56:39.178]  And so they're going into bondage.
[00:56:39.178 --> 00:56:41.558]  You see, there's always a minority that says no.
[00:56:41.558 --> 00:56:47.980]  And Infowars is that minority.
[00:56:47.980 --> 00:56:50.601]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:03.462 --> 00:57:10.030]  There are a further 135 million people facing crisis levels of hunger or worse.
[00:57:10.030 --> 00:57:17.079]  That means 135 million people on Earth are marching toward the brink of starvation.
[00:57:17.079 --> 00:57:18.081]  An additional 130 million people
[00:57:20.902 --> 00:57:23.523]  Could be pushed to the brink of starvation by the end of 2020.
[00:57:23.523 --> 00:57:27.204]  That's a total of 265 million people.
[00:57:27.204 --> 00:57:37.846]  Our analysis shows that 300,000 people could starve to death every single day over a three-month period.
[00:57:37.846 --> 00:57:39.306]  Three-month period.
[00:57:39.306 --> 00:57:40.767]  So that was six months ago.
[00:57:40.767 --> 00:57:43.688]  That's David Beasley, head of the UN Food Program.
[00:57:43.688 --> 00:57:44.748]  I don't just believe the UN.
[00:57:44.748 --> 00:57:45.388]  I've looked at the numbers.
[00:57:45.388 --> 00:57:47.228]  There's probably more people starving to death.
[00:57:47.228 --> 00:57:49.429]  Because they don't call it starvation unless it's on a tow tag.
[00:57:50.373 --> 00:57:55.217]  If it's malnutrition, you just die of the first virus comes along because of malnutrition.
[00:57:55.217 --> 00:57:58.759]  Just like so many Americans are obese, but they're not getting the right nutrition.
[00:57:58.759 --> 00:58:00.040]  I mean, I'm not perfect either.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:01.161]  I eat like a pig.
[00:58:01.161 --> 00:58:03.403]  At least I supplement on top of it, so I don't get sick hardly ever.
[00:58:03.403 --> 00:58:07.385]  I got a lot of stamina and libido, but again, they know what they're doing.
[00:58:07.385 --> 00:58:15.251]  Here's Richard Ryan, head of the UN Global Emergency Disease Response, saying, we're coming in your houses to take you out.
[00:58:15.251 --> 00:58:17.373]  Well, they started doing it in Spain,
[00:58:18.962 --> 00:58:25.163]  In Australia, everywhere they got people in line, in key cities, controlled by leftists.
[00:58:25.163 --> 00:58:30.444]  And they say that in this Labour Party secret document that leaked six months ago.
[00:58:30.444 --> 00:58:31.345]  It's now confirmed.
[00:58:31.345 --> 00:58:33.545]  Everything in that document, they now admit is real.
[00:58:33.545 --> 00:58:39.906]  They've had hearings in Parliament in Ottawa, admitting that it's all a takeover.
[00:58:39.906 --> 00:58:41.387]  It's a political operation.
[00:58:41.387 --> 00:58:43.067]  It's so damn criminal.
[00:58:43.067 --> 00:58:44.908]  Just like they're stealing the election.
[00:58:44.908 --> 00:58:46.868]  Here's what this monster Ryan had to say.
[00:58:48.101 --> 00:58:59.163]  At the moment, in most parts of the world, due to lockdown, most of the transmission that's actually happening in many countries now is happening in the household, at family level.
[00:58:59.163 --> 00:59:05.644]  In some senses, transmission has been taken off the streets and pushed back into family units.
[00:59:05.644 --> 00:59:15.126]  Now, we need to go and look in families to find those people who may be sick and remove them and isolate them in a safe and dignified manner.
[00:59:16.884 --> 00:59:23.409]  Oh, just like you keep the baby comfortable when you harvest his organs in a safe and dignified manner?
[00:59:23.409 --> 00:59:27.232]  Oh, it's like the CIA would say, we torture people in a very safe and dignified manner.
[00:59:27.232 --> 00:59:29.193]  It's very professional.
[00:59:29.193 --> 00:59:33.336]  This is all sycophantic bureaucrats and their takeover.
[00:59:33.336 --> 00:59:38.660]  And Klaus Schwab admits, running all this from the Davos Group, that COVID's just a cover.
[00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:40.742]  Bill Gates says COVID's just a drill.
[00:59:40.742 --> 00:59:41.983]  We're bringing in the new world order.
[00:59:41.983 --> 00:59:44.064]  We're cutting your carbon.
[00:59:44.064 --> 00:59:44.665]  And they're doing it all.
[00:59:45.762 --> 00:59:46.562]  Now this is a short segment.
[00:59:46.562 --> 00:59:54.387]  When we come back, I'm going to get to a doctor, Dr. Mattar, who again, this video goes viral.
[00:59:54.387 --> 00:59:56.428]  People ask, is this real?
[00:59:56.428 --> 01:00:00.009]  And I saw this and remembered the last eight months we saw this build up.
[01:00:00.009 --> 01:00:01.991]  It's 10 months now.
[01:00:01.991 --> 01:00:04.212]  And I'm like, yeah, of course it's real.
[01:00:04.212 --> 01:00:09.655]  But see, that's the thing is Joseph Goebbels, I've read some of his writings, the Nazi propagandists.
[01:00:09.655 --> 01:00:13.837]  He said, don't make your propaganda too complex.
[01:00:14.963 --> 01:00:19.206]  Don't get into the fine minutiae, because that trains people to think complex.
[01:00:19.206 --> 01:00:23.009]  You want to dumb them down with the propaganda and make it real simple.
[01:00:23.009 --> 01:00:24.511]  And so you want to speak to their laziness.
[01:00:25.751 --> 01:00:27.732]  And just say, oh, don't worry about it.
[01:00:27.732 --> 01:00:28.413]  It's not going on.
[01:00:28.413 --> 01:00:29.874]  That's probably not real.
[01:00:29.874 --> 01:00:37.139]  And that's the attitude when I'm like, hey, you know, Bill Gates ran the Wuhan lab with Fauci and all the bird flu, uh, gain of function, bat coronavirus research.
[01:00:37.139 --> 01:00:38.660]  You know, here it came out five years ago.
[01:00:38.660 --> 01:00:39.701]  They said it was really dangerous.
[01:00:39.701 --> 01:00:44.504]  And then China ran the cover up with them and the China admits it's a weapon and it's gain of function.
[01:00:44.504 --> 01:00:45.305]  So it never goes away.
[01:00:45.305 --> 01:00:46.446]  And it always reinfects.
[01:00:46.446 --> 01:00:47.927]  So we're always guilty forever.
[01:00:47.927 --> 01:00:50.709]  We're always fighting an enemy that can't be defeated.
[01:00:50.709 --> 01:00:52.630]  People just go, dude, nobody knows this stuff.
[01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:53.591]  Stop acting like you're smart.
[01:00:55.615 --> 01:00:58.377]  I'm like, I'm not acting like I'm smart.
[01:00:58.377 --> 01:00:59.878]  These are enemies.
[01:00:59.878 --> 01:01:01.198]  I've studied our enemy.
[01:01:01.198 --> 01:01:02.459]  I know what they're doing.
[01:01:02.459 --> 01:01:03.480]  I know what's coming next.
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:07.562]  And now, thanks to you, the listeners, I want to thank you so much.
[01:01:07.562 --> 01:01:11.605]  And thanks to God, first and foremost, you kept my crazy ass on the air.
[01:01:12.768 --> 01:01:17.290]  And now our listeners are just skyrocketing, which is dangerous for me.
[01:01:17.290 --> 01:01:19.371]  But I'm here to take my licks.
[01:01:19.371 --> 01:01:20.971]  I'm in Jesus Christ's hands.
[01:01:20.971 --> 01:01:22.472]  So I'm not up here going, oh, my show's big.
[01:01:22.472 --> 01:01:23.232]  I want to be the biggest.
[01:01:23.232 --> 01:01:25.673]  That's not... I want to go live on a farm.
[01:01:25.673 --> 01:01:27.454]  I'm sick of this, but I've got to fight.
[01:01:28.382 --> 01:01:30.783]  And I just want you to know, we were supposed to be off air.
[01:01:30.783 --> 01:01:32.663]  Everybody else is going to be off the air soon.
[01:01:32.663 --> 01:01:35.364]  And then finally they're going to come bust a cat in my ass, probably.
[01:01:35.364 --> 01:01:35.964]  But it doesn't matter.
[01:01:35.964 --> 01:01:36.805]  It's all in Jesus' hands.
[01:01:36.805 --> 01:01:37.685]  I can't wait to do the Lord.
[01:01:37.685 --> 01:01:38.305]  I don't want to die.
[01:01:38.305 --> 01:01:41.506]  I could commit suicide, but I don't fear these people at all.
[01:01:41.506 --> 01:01:43.447]  Except for the little children, though.
[01:01:43.447 --> 01:01:45.888]  But we're going to be here through it all.
[01:01:45.888 --> 01:01:46.808]  And you're going to face it all.
[01:01:46.808 --> 01:01:49.409]  The Antichrist, world government, brain-chipping, everything.
[01:01:50.009 --> 01:01:51.590]  And you're going to finally find out who you're going to serve.
[01:01:51.590 --> 01:01:52.931]  You're going to finally choose who you're going to join.
[01:01:52.931 --> 01:01:57.334]  Two Info Wars best-selling products are now back in stock for being sold out for months.
[01:01:57.334 --> 01:02:03.518]  Bio-True Selenium from the mustard seed, essential in all electrochemical activity in the cells in the body.
[01:02:03.518 --> 01:02:05.320]  That's every human activity.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:10.924]  And on top of it, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% curcuminoid.
[01:02:10.924 --> 01:02:13.746]  Leading competitors have 3% to 5%.
[01:02:13.746 --> 01:02:18.409]  The things that turmeric does, I don't have to tell you, this is the highest quality, the strongest you're going to find.
[01:02:18.889 --> 01:02:23.871]  So both these are amazing products, and they fund the InfoWar, which is a 360 win.
[01:02:23.871 --> 01:02:34.595]  On top of it, despite the fact they're in demand, they've been sold out for months, they're both 50% off, triple Patriot points, and free shipping at InfoWarStore.com.
[01:02:34.595 --> 01:02:37.757]  That's Bio True Selenium from the mustard seed.
[01:02:37.757 --> 01:02:39.057]  It's amazing.
[01:02:39.057 --> 01:02:41.058]  And on top of it, we also have bodies.
[01:02:41.118 --> 01:02:45.539]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones!
[01:03:09.125 --> 01:03:18.172]  It is Friday the 13th on this Friday edition, November 13th, 2020.
[01:03:18.172 --> 01:03:21.354]  And coming up at the bottom of the hour, I do want to open the phones up.
[01:03:21.354 --> 01:03:32.282]  We have Ezra Levant joining us from Canada, which is the first step in North America phase two lockdown, which is Nazi Germany, Soviet Russia.
[01:03:32.282 --> 01:03:34.043]  I mean, if you want to be there, you're going to be there.
[01:03:35.464 --> 01:03:43.571]  Very cold-blooded bureaucrats who want absolute control over everything, who've sold out, and who really, really enjoy what they're doing.
[01:03:43.571 --> 01:03:45.993]  So that's all coming up.
[01:03:45.993 --> 01:03:49.736]  Here is a video from six months ago, and now they're doing it.
[01:03:49.736 --> 01:03:59.364]  People criticizing the lockdown in Australia and Canada are now being arrested and taken to secret facilities and disappearing.
[01:03:59.364 --> 01:04:01.366]  And the Liberals are like, that's good, kill fascists!
[01:04:02.307 --> 01:04:05.229]  See, you tell a leftist, hey, lockdowns are fighting Nazis.
[01:04:05.229 --> 01:04:07.351]  Oh, good.
[01:04:07.351 --> 01:04:08.912]  Your country existing is Nazi.
[01:04:08.912 --> 01:04:11.593]  Oh, get rid of my country.
[01:04:11.593 --> 01:04:17.077]  These people are so sick, but they're millennials and others that have been given everything, and they just want to be on the winning team.
[01:04:17.077 --> 01:04:19.419]  They're not on the winning team.
[01:04:19.419 --> 01:04:22.721]  So again, I am your host, Alex Jones, on this Live Friday edition.
[01:04:22.721 --> 01:04:28.585]  If you pull up the headline of the live show today, it says it all.
[01:04:28.585 --> 01:04:30.707]  And the magnitude of this is just totally unspeakable.
[01:04:32.025 --> 01:04:49.592]  They are now officially rolling this system out with the AI surveillance grid, with all of it, to enforce this societal takeover that causes a global societal collapse, and then they will reorganize society with a universal income that makes you a slave.
[01:04:49.592 --> 01:05:00.277]  A slave in the bottom of a slave ship coming over from Africa, or in the back of a wagon out of Germany into Rome thousands of years ago, was given food to keep the slave alive.
[01:05:01.363 --> 01:05:03.463]  But you are not free.
[01:05:03.463 --> 01:05:08.465]  And so they admit that's what this is, and they say it's to get you ready for sterilization.
[01:05:08.465 --> 01:05:13.806]  And they're going to give you vaccines that sterilize you, bare minimum, and then also give you cancer.
[01:05:13.806 --> 01:05:21.707]  The way it works is they go embed in your cells, start replicating, your body defeats it the first few times, then it reinfects.
[01:05:21.707 --> 01:05:23.368]  And that's really what COVID-19 is.
[01:05:23.368 --> 01:05:28.089]  COVID-19 is the opening salvo for a whole family of viruses
[01:05:29.107 --> 01:05:33.688]  that are in the COVID Chimera family that are going to be brought out.
[01:05:33.688 --> 01:05:38.189]  COVID is like a starter pistol cartridge.
[01:05:38.189 --> 01:05:39.589]  It's got powder in it.
[01:05:39.589 --> 01:05:41.590]  It makes a gunshot noise.
[01:05:41.590 --> 01:05:49.191]  And if you put a starter pistol to your head, it'll blow gas out of the barrel into your brain and kill you.
[01:05:49.191 --> 01:05:52.792]  You know, that's how Bruce Lee's son died was playing around with a starter pistol.
[01:05:52.792 --> 01:05:55.852]  A lot of folks do that.
[01:05:55.852 --> 01:05:58.133]  But if you put a bullet in it, it's very deadly.
[01:05:59.594 --> 01:06:00.814]  And so that's what it is.
[01:06:00.814 --> 01:06:05.296]  It's a gain-of-function spreader system to infect everyone.
[01:06:05.296 --> 01:06:07.016]  So infection is what's bad.
[01:06:07.016 --> 01:06:08.637]  Infection is the crime.
[01:06:08.637 --> 01:06:10.897]  Infection is the big deal, not the death rate.
[01:06:10.897 --> 01:06:17.719]  They had to kill a lot of old folks, count folks that died of flu and gunshot wounds and car wrecks in the column.
[01:06:17.719 --> 01:06:24.702]  Now that local doctors know about that, they're refusing, when ordered, to put COVID-19 on the death certificates like they did six months ago.
[01:06:24.702 --> 01:06:25.762]  They understood it was political.
[01:06:25.762 --> 01:06:26.762]  They said no.
[01:06:26.762 --> 01:06:28.983]  The left's like, fine, we won't talk about increased deaths.
[01:06:30.779 --> 01:06:36.183]  We will simply say, look, the number of infections is going up correspondingly with the testing.
[01:06:36.183 --> 01:06:38.165]  Elon Musk took four tests.
[01:06:38.165 --> 01:06:40.367]  Two came up positive, two came up negative.
[01:06:40.367 --> 01:06:44.250]  The Tanzanian president, who's a scientist, sent off a bunch of tests.
[01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:49.474]  He sent off more than 20, but the ones that got attention was the goat and the papaya.
[01:06:49.474 --> 01:06:50.115]  Both the goat
[01:06:51.621 --> 01:06:53.862]  And the papaya came up positive.
[01:06:53.862 --> 01:07:01.767]  And you know, he thought this must be staged because something like 80% of the tests the UN was getting out of their country were saying the Tanzanians had this.
[01:07:01.767 --> 01:07:03.168]  But they weren't sick.
[01:07:03.168 --> 01:07:05.189]  He said, I think the test is faulty by design.
[01:07:05.189 --> 01:07:06.529]  He's a scientist.
[01:07:06.529 --> 01:07:16.435]  And sure enough, the goat, the papaya, the cabbage, some other animal, all had it, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:16.435 --> 01:07:16.955]  Look it up.
[01:07:16.955 --> 01:07:17.956]  Over 20 things they tested.
[01:07:18.874 --> 01:07:20.115]  It's all a fraud.
[01:07:20.115 --> 01:07:21.256]  It's all a lie.
[01:07:21.256 --> 01:07:22.437]  It's all a scam.
[01:07:22.437 --> 01:07:24.598]  And it's only going to get worse until we say no.
[01:07:24.598 --> 01:07:28.120]  So here's the health director of Quebec City, Canada.
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:28.721]  It's in French.
[01:07:28.721 --> 01:07:30.882]  I won't play the whole thing.
[01:07:30.882 --> 01:07:34.805]  But they say if you criticize the lockdown, you'll be taken to the FEMA Center.
[01:07:34.805 --> 01:07:36.166]  It's the same thing up there.
[01:07:36.166 --> 01:07:38.788]  And here's a little bit of this guy, this little tyrant.
[01:07:40.632 --> 01:07:40.872]  Yes.
[01:07:40.872 --> 01:07:42.133]  Alright, that's enough.
[01:07:42.133 --> 01:07:46.974]  Now, this is a medical tyranny, not, oh, listen to the doctors, they're the scientists, they know, you don't know.
[01:07:46.974 --> 01:07:49.655]  Well, most of the doctors say it's all a hoax and a fraud, a scam.
[01:08:09.761 --> 01:08:10.903]  Okay?
[01:08:10.903 --> 01:08:14.247]  Most of the doctors know it's a giant fraud.
[01:08:14.247 --> 01:08:15.509]  But they don't get to have voices.
[01:08:15.509 --> 01:08:21.797]  In fact, they get shut down online because we've got to listen to the scientists, these few select people like Fauci and this dirtbag.
[01:08:22.714 --> 01:08:27.098]  Let's listen to Dr. Buttar, who's a medical doctor.
[01:08:27.098 --> 01:08:30.922]  He has a show that's popular called Ask Buttar.
[01:08:30.922 --> 01:08:31.623]  And here he is.
[01:08:31.623 --> 01:08:34.125]  This is being censored off Facebook, off Twitter, off everywhere.
[01:08:34.125 --> 01:08:38.329]  So we're going to add it to the censored page at band.video.
[01:08:38.329 --> 01:08:39.871]  And he's reading a real document.
[01:08:39.871 --> 01:08:40.792]  I've got it all right here.
[01:08:40.792 --> 01:08:43.354]  It's in the news months after this came out.
[01:08:43.354 --> 01:08:44.535]  But this is going viral now.
[01:08:45.536 --> 01:08:46.957]  And so here's what they don't want you to see.
[01:08:46.957 --> 01:08:53.459]  The full video is posted in the live show feed today under my live show feed at Historic Friday Transmission.
[01:08:53.459 --> 01:08:57.521]  The UN announces planetary lockdown, concentration camps for dissenters.
[01:08:57.521 --> 01:09:05.084]  Only President Trump and we, the free people of the planet, stand in the way of world government depopulation plan.
[01:09:05.084 --> 01:09:08.745]  Alex Jones reports from deep in the swamp of D.C.
[01:09:08.745 --> 01:09:12.707]  on the eve of the Stop the Steal march on Saturday at the White House.
[01:09:13.706 --> 01:09:15.026]  A lot of folks are here.
[01:09:15.026 --> 01:09:16.047]  Big crowds are showing up.
[01:09:16.047 --> 01:09:17.547]  So be sure to get here, folks.
[01:09:17.547 --> 01:09:18.567]  This is historic.
[01:09:18.567 --> 01:09:19.788]  You won't show up for a peaceful march.
[01:09:19.788 --> 01:09:21.128]  You won't show up for the fight.
[01:09:21.128 --> 01:09:23.689]  This will stop the fight if it's big enough.
[01:09:23.689 --> 01:09:26.590]  But let's go to Dr. Batar.
[01:09:26.590 --> 01:09:27.970]  Here it is.
[01:09:27.970 --> 01:09:29.791]  Sent to me.
[01:09:29.791 --> 01:09:34.432]  And I'll just say her first name to protect her identity.
[01:09:34.432 --> 01:09:37.013]  Denise, D-E-N-Y-S-E.
[01:09:37.013 --> 01:09:39.414]  Maybe that's not protecting identity because that's not a common name.
[01:09:39.414 --> 01:09:41.834]  But anyway, Denise is her name.
[01:09:41.834 --> 01:09:43.075]  And she sent an email.
[01:09:44.096 --> 01:09:50.240]  And this email talked about something that's happening in Canada.
[01:09:50.240 --> 01:10:03.049]  The subject was leaked email from Liberal Party of Canada lays out the plan for what's going to happen in November, December, and then the first and second and third quarters of 2021.
[01:10:03.049 --> 01:10:09.134]  Now this is not based upon what a person's opinion is or conjecture is.
[01:10:09.134 --> 01:10:13.557]  This is based upon what actually happened at a meeting
[01:10:14.605 --> 01:10:22.492]  in the legislative bodies on the liberal side in Canada.
[01:10:22.492 --> 01:10:23.573]  So here's what it comes down to.
[01:10:23.573 --> 01:10:28.036]  The roadmap and aim was set out by the PMO and is as follows.
[01:10:28.036 --> 01:10:31.759]  And I hate looking down when I'm reading this, so let me see if I can read it this way.
[01:10:34.588 --> 01:10:43.416]  Phase in secondary lockdown restrictions on a rolling basis starting with major metropolitan areas first and expanding outward.
[01:10:43.416 --> 01:10:45.077]  Expected by November 2020.
[01:10:45.077 --> 01:10:47.860]  Next one.
[01:10:47.860 --> 01:10:54.305]  Rush the acquisition of or construction of isolation facilities across every province and territory.
[01:10:54.305 --> 01:10:55.386]  Expected by December 2020.
[01:10:55.386 --> 01:10:58.129]  These are concentration camps they're talking about.
[01:10:58.962 --> 01:11:03.125]  Daily new cases of COVID-19 will surge beyond capacity of testing.
[01:11:03.125 --> 01:11:05.487]  Interesting that they already know that they're going to surge, right?
[01:11:05.487 --> 01:11:05.727]  Why?
[01:11:05.727 --> 01:11:14.074]  Because they know that if there is such a virus out there, assuming that there's a real virus out there, the testing is already predetermined.
[01:11:14.074 --> 01:11:22.260]  They're testing, they're attenuating, they're basically amplifying the RT-PCR test to the point that every human being will test positive.
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:23.021]  That's what their goal is.
[01:11:23.681 --> 01:11:35.171]  All right, so the new daily cases of COVID will surge beyond capacity of testing, including increases in COVID-related deaths following the same growth curves expected by end of November 2020.
[01:11:35.171 --> 01:11:42.838]  Complete and total secondary lockdown much stricter than the first and second rolling phase restrictions expected by end of December 2020, early January 2021.
[01:11:45.020 --> 01:11:55.129]  Reform and expansion of the Unemployment Program to be transitioned into the Universal Basic Income Program, expected by Q1 2021.
[01:11:55.129 --> 01:12:08.881]  Projected COVID-19 mutation and or co-infection with secondary virus, referred to as COVID-21, leading to a third wave with much higher mortality rate and higher rate of infection, expected by February 2021.
[01:12:10.362 --> 01:12:19.388]  Daily new cases of COVID-21 hospitalizations and COVID-19 and COVID-21 related deaths will exceed medical facility capacities.
[01:12:19.388 --> 01:12:20.849]  Guys, bring me on.
[01:12:20.849 --> 01:12:23.210]  Guys, back that up 20 seconds and come back.
[01:12:23.210 --> 01:12:25.792]  And again, I have, this came out months and months ago.
[01:12:25.792 --> 01:12:27.053]  People go, oh, it's not real.
[01:12:27.053 --> 01:12:29.474]  Now I have Reuters, all of them saying the same thing.
[01:12:29.474 --> 01:12:30.595]  It was a real document.
[01:12:30.595 --> 01:12:36.879]  Labor Party calls for quarantines, forced inoculation, permanent lockdown, all of it.
[01:12:36.879 --> 01:12:38.760]  But did you hear the key?
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:39.321]  Did you hear the key?
[01:12:40.245 --> 01:12:44.851]  A more deadly mutation, because they've already got it loaded and ready, as I said 10 months ago.
[01:12:44.851 --> 01:12:45.872]  I studied the enemy.
[01:12:45.872 --> 01:12:47.735]  So they've got the new one.
[01:12:47.735 --> 01:12:51.439]  Once you accept lockdown, now they go, okay, they're accepting it?
[01:12:51.439 --> 01:12:51.720]  Hit them!
[01:13:02.950 --> 01:13:07.253]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[01:13:07.253 --> 01:13:10.735]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[01:13:10.735 --> 01:13:14.018]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[01:13:14.018 --> 01:13:17.560]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.802]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[01:13:19.802 --> 01:13:21.203]  I suggest Band.Video.
[01:13:21.883 --> 01:13:27.347]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[01:13:27.347 --> 01:13:35.832]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[01:13:35.832 --> 01:13:43.677]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want.
[01:13:43.677 --> 01:13:45.358]  Be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.

[01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:58.993]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:14:58.993 --> 01:15:15.042]  I want to be clear here, get Alex Jones back live from Washington D.C.
[01:15:15.042 --> 01:15:17.564]  on the eve of the big march tomorrow at 12 noon right outside the White House.
[01:15:20.561 --> 01:15:22.402]  Most people aren't inherently evil.
[01:15:22.402 --> 01:15:26.024]  We've all fallen, we've all sinned, we've all fallen short of the glory of God, but we still love God.
[01:15:26.024 --> 01:15:28.326]  We love justice.
[01:15:28.326 --> 01:15:30.727]  But there are people that love Satan.
[01:15:30.727 --> 01:15:34.529]  Take Fauci, right behind me if you're a TV viewer.
[01:15:34.529 --> 01:15:37.011]  He is acting like he is happy as a pig, and you know what?
[01:15:37.011 --> 01:15:44.135]  And I've been watching all the former Homeland Security heads talk about the permanent lockdown, how they're taking over, how great it is.
[01:15:44.135 --> 01:15:46.116]  It makes you all Al Qaeda suspects.
[01:15:47.168 --> 01:15:55.195]  And all they're doing is making the test more and more sensitive, where if there's any viral debris or bacterial debris, it says you have COVID.
[01:15:55.195 --> 01:15:56.796]  It's very simple.
[01:15:56.796 --> 01:15:57.677]  It's a little computer.
[01:15:57.677 --> 01:16:00.679]  Swab up your nose and the computer sees what's going on.
[01:16:00.679 --> 01:16:04.302]  And it's why one person says positive, one person says negative.
[01:16:04.302 --> 01:16:11.388]  But you get the flu, you get pneumonia, they're gonna kill your ass with the inhibition if you go to the wrong hospital.
[01:16:11.388 --> 01:16:13.910]  So this is life and death to warn everyone we know
[01:16:14.795 --> 01:16:18.376]  And stop being these people who just look at our phones all day, but talk to other people.
[01:16:18.376 --> 01:16:20.696]  That's the real fight here.
[01:16:20.696 --> 01:16:24.957]  I want to take your calls about the election, about the election fraud, about what President Trump should do.
[01:16:24.957 --> 01:16:29.858]  I saw an article last night where Trump will speak when the time is right.
[01:16:29.858 --> 01:16:33.539]  Now he's getting his evidence of fraud ready, and it's there.
[01:16:33.539 --> 01:16:34.699]  It's massive.
[01:16:34.699 --> 01:16:36.939]  But I want to be clear about something.
[01:16:36.939 --> 01:16:40.320]  The globalists have run this whole COVID exaggeration hoax situation.
[01:16:41.394 --> 01:16:43.315]  They have lied to us on so many fronts.
[01:16:43.315 --> 01:16:46.256]  Joe Biden is a communist Chinese agent.
[01:16:46.256 --> 01:16:53.380]  Even if Joe Biden had legally won this election, which he didn't, he's illegitimate because he's a communist Chinese agent.
[01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:57.302]  And that needs to be the tack of the president, that he's a communist Chinese agent.
[01:16:57.302 --> 01:17:03.024]  They said Trump was a Russian agent and was illegitimate, and he almost didn't get inaugurated with no evidence.
[01:17:03.024 --> 01:17:06.326]  You're talking about empty air, not one shred of proof.
[01:17:06.326 --> 01:17:07.887]  Empty air.
[01:17:07.887 --> 01:17:10.548]  But with the case of Trump,
[01:17:11.912 --> 01:17:15.634]  It's as solid as this table that he's a patriot.
[01:17:15.634 --> 01:17:22.578]  But with the case of Biden, we have him dead to rights, open and shut.
[01:17:22.578 --> 01:17:24.600]  But again, the globalists are going for broke.
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:25.680]  They're going to steal elections.
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:26.741]  They're going to lie.
[01:17:26.741 --> 01:17:29.883]  They're going to exaggerate COVID deaths hundreds of times they are.
[01:17:29.883 --> 01:17:35.986]  They're never going to let go once they get their teeth into you because they're ruthless and they want power.
[01:17:35.986 --> 01:17:38.288]  And they were brought into cults.
[01:17:38.288 --> 01:17:40.189]  How many times did I tell you about my dad?
[01:17:41.274 --> 01:17:50.698]  My dad volunteered, he thought, for a pre-induction system into NASA, okay?
[01:17:50.698 --> 01:18:01.864]  And by the time he was 15, he was at MD Anderson Cancer Research Facility in Houston, working in absolutely incredible stuff, okay?
[01:18:01.864 --> 01:18:03.765]  And then he was in Plan 2 UT by 16.
[01:18:06.465 --> 01:18:13.708]  And they were only letting a very small number of people in the whole state of Texas who tested the highest score levels into this.
[01:18:13.708 --> 01:18:20.931]  They called them in, they go, here's a secret reactor, nuclear reactor under UT, we don't tell the public about the nuclear reactor.
[01:18:20.931 --> 01:18:28.355]  And they took them in, they said, here's our computers, here's our CD-ROMs, weren't invented for 20 years, don't tell the public about this.
[01:18:28.355 --> 01:18:31.116]  My dad didn't tell me this stuff till I was older.
[01:18:32.324 --> 01:18:34.085]  I'd heard this and that when I was a kid.
[01:18:34.085 --> 01:18:41.769]  I knew that when he was 16, they delivered him an 18-wheeler with the parts to build a Ruby Laser as part of a Union Carbide thing.
[01:18:41.769 --> 01:18:45.371]  I mean, it was part of the Eisenhower's Whiz Kid program.
[01:18:45.371 --> 01:18:49.914]  But Eisenhower later learned what it really was, and all these kids wanted to be in NASA?
[01:18:49.914 --> 01:18:53.756]  Well, they weren't getting recruited for NASA, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:18:53.756 --> 01:18:57.598]  And so finally, my dad was top of the top of those groups.
[01:18:57.598 --> 01:18:59.439]  So they call him in.
[01:18:59.439 --> 01:18:59.999]  He's 17 years old.
[01:19:01.872 --> 01:19:08.395]  He's at the head of the botany department's house, and it's an old Jewish guy, Professor Speer.
[01:19:08.395 --> 01:19:13.137]  He closes the door and he goes, David, he goes, we don't like Hitler.
[01:19:13.137 --> 01:19:15.418]  He was only going to get certain people.
[01:19:15.418 --> 01:19:20.080]  But we do, eugenics is real, and we have to get rid of the bad people of every group.
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:23.642]  And you're part of the good group now, and we want you to be part of this.
[01:19:24.844 --> 01:19:27.786]  And my dad was involved in a few years and got out of it, okay?
[01:19:27.786 --> 01:19:30.268]  But they did this with millions of people.
[01:19:30.268 --> 01:19:33.910]  Fauci, all of them, were recruited by a Robert Barron scientist.
[01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:36.312]  He's 79 years old.
[01:19:36.312 --> 01:19:53.383]  So they bring him in and they go, there's too many people, Tony, and you are in charge, and you're an elitist, and you're 16, you're 17, you get recruited out of high school, before you're out of high school, and you're told that the Earth has a carrying capacity,
[01:19:54.517 --> 01:19:58.041]  Just like bacteria in a petri dish with a cure.
[01:19:58.041 --> 01:20:04.008]  And they're going to eat through that, and it's limited resources, and we're going to kill the planet, and humanity's going to die, Tony.
[01:20:04.008 --> 01:20:06.671]  Tony, we need you to join us and be part of this.
[01:20:06.671 --> 01:20:08.093]  There's going to be some hard stuff we've got to do.
[01:20:09.019 --> 01:20:18.307]  We're going to have to, just like breeding dogs, to get certain breeds, you'd have hundreds of breedings, and they would take the puppies that didn't have the traits they liked and put them in a cage and put them in water.
[01:20:18.307 --> 01:20:22.590]  And it looks really sad, but we got poodles, we got German Shepherds.
[01:20:22.590 --> 01:20:25.493]  We did the hard thing to get these cool dogs.
[01:20:25.493 --> 01:20:29.596]  Well, we're going to do it with humans, Tony.
[01:20:29.596 --> 01:20:31.137]  Tony, you're the best.
[01:20:31.137 --> 01:20:33.779]  We want to groom you for position of power.
[01:20:33.779 --> 01:20:37.783]  And here he is at almost 80 years old, and he's a planetary ruler.
[01:20:39.821 --> 01:20:44.482]  He's this little god, he knows best, like John P. Holdren and all of them.
[01:20:44.482 --> 01:20:46.063]  I've read their books, I've read their writings.
[01:20:46.063 --> 01:21:04.728]  John P. Holdren, Obama's science-art, said, use a virus to take over, put fluoride in the water to sterilize people, give them forced inoculations, dumb them down, use zip codes according to how low income somebody is, we'll give them this vaccine and this zip code, we'll give people this vaccine and that zip code, and that's why
[01:21:05.865 --> 01:21:12.170]  That's why Gates, again on Japanese TV, said, listen, you've heard we're sterilizing people who do this.
[01:21:12.170 --> 01:21:13.851]  He goes, don't worry about that.
[01:21:13.851 --> 01:21:15.973]  The third world gets a different vaccine.
[01:21:15.973 --> 01:21:22.858]  And the Japanese reporter went, oh, I mean, this is the real deal, folks.
[01:21:22.858 --> 01:21:23.859]  Okay.
[01:21:23.859 --> 01:21:26.882]  And so they tried to recruit everybody.
[01:21:26.882 --> 01:21:29.504]  I remember reading, having historians on, I read Anthony Sutton's book.
[01:21:30.566 --> 01:21:35.209]  And about how you'd have somebody at the top of their class in high school, and one story was Minnesota.
[01:21:35.209 --> 01:21:48.638]  It's a valedictorian in the lunch line, and David Rockefeller just pops up and goes, you've got the highest test scores in every field, and we know you went for some advanced testing that this group offered you, and we found you're really, we want you.
[01:21:48.638 --> 01:21:52.020]  And they just want every thinker for them.
[01:21:52.020 --> 01:21:54.241]  And so that's what Google and Facebook are telling you.
[01:21:54.241 --> 01:21:56.263]  Only our thinkers can talk.
[01:21:56.263 --> 01:21:57.603]  Only our thinkers can be heard.
[01:21:58.644 --> 01:22:01.425]  Only our thinkers can be on air.
[01:22:01.425 --> 01:22:02.486]  No one else can.
[01:22:02.486 --> 01:22:07.928]  And it's all about wiping out almost everybody and establishing a world government.
[01:22:07.928 --> 01:22:09.249]  But that was the old story.
[01:22:09.249 --> 01:22:10.549]  Oh, we're doing this to save the Earth.
[01:22:10.549 --> 01:22:12.710]  Now they're like, you know, humans are bad.
[01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:14.751]  We're going to be a silicon life form.
[01:22:14.751 --> 01:22:16.612]  We're going to override all the genetics of the planet.
[01:22:16.612 --> 01:22:18.873]  We're going to be gods.
[01:22:18.873 --> 01:22:20.394]  And people are like, well, I thought we were going to save the Earth.
[01:22:20.394 --> 01:22:21.334]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:22:21.334 --> 01:22:23.115]  We can build 100 Earths.
[01:22:23.115 --> 01:22:25.536]  Let's actually genetically engineer everything and change it all.
[01:22:26.852 --> 01:22:28.073]  Let's have human-animal hybrids.
[01:22:28.073 --> 01:22:28.493]  Let's do it all.
[01:22:28.493 --> 01:22:29.673]  It's all there, see?
[01:22:29.673 --> 01:22:30.954]  So it's all a lie, folks.
[01:22:30.954 --> 01:22:32.174]  It's all satanic.
[01:22:32.174 --> 01:22:33.335]  It's all evil.
[01:22:33.335 --> 01:22:35.756]  They try to dumb us down to control us.
[01:22:35.756 --> 01:22:38.697]  They're not trying to build us up.
[01:22:38.697 --> 01:22:42.198]  They're not trying to take the smart people to join them because they care about smart people.
[01:22:42.198 --> 01:22:44.599]  It's an alien evil spirit.
[01:22:44.599 --> 01:22:49.441]  An alien dimensional force, as the Bible says, that wants to kill, steal, and destroy.
[01:22:49.441 --> 01:22:53.063]  And it's come to get our intelligentsia so no one would stand against them.
[01:22:53.854 --> 01:22:54.655]  When the time came.
[01:22:54.655 --> 01:23:00.539]  And they came to flatter the intelligentsia when they were high school students.
[01:23:00.539 --> 01:23:02.241]  And to say, you're going to join NASA.
[01:23:02.241 --> 01:23:06.264]  It's like, well, the slots are filled for NASA for 15 year olds.
[01:23:06.264 --> 01:23:09.587]  But how would you like us to deliver you an 18-wheeler with a laser and see if you can build it?
[01:23:11.274 --> 01:23:12.914]  How'd you like to see the nuclear reactor?
[01:23:12.914 --> 01:23:14.315]  Nobody else gets to see this.
[01:23:14.315 --> 01:23:17.035]  How'd you like to cross humans with animals in our lab?
[01:23:17.035 --> 01:23:18.036]  I've had the scientists call in.
[01:23:18.036 --> 01:23:18.936]  I've had guests on.
[01:23:18.936 --> 01:23:23.717]  Same deal, where they're like research scientists now, 25 years old, getting their PhD.
[01:23:23.717 --> 01:23:24.937]  They're like, come on in here.
[01:23:24.937 --> 01:23:26.598]  Let me show you what's down here.
[01:23:26.598 --> 01:23:29.198]  I already had them approach me at UT.
[01:23:29.198 --> 01:23:31.619]  I was being given these tours and stuff in classified facilities.
[01:23:31.619 --> 01:23:33.399]  I was like, why am I being given this?
[01:23:33.399 --> 01:23:35.940]  They said, Jones, just come on.
[01:23:35.940 --> 01:23:36.380]  Join us.
[01:23:38.208 --> 01:23:40.532]  You're never, the public doesn't care about you, Jones.
[01:23:40.532 --> 01:23:41.454]  They're not going to help you.
[01:23:41.454 --> 01:23:44.660]  And I'm like, wait a minute, you're showing me this because you're one of them.
[01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:45.060]  They're like, yeah.
[01:23:50.199 --> 01:23:51.000]  Warning!
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:51.720]  Warning!
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:52.581]  Warning!
[01:23:52.581 --> 01:24:08.195]  There is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover, the giant third world collapse, and a new world war that is going to be triggered by the new COVID lockdown announced by globalist systems in Europe, in Asia, and now in the United States.
[01:24:09.136 --> 01:24:23.859]  Joe Biden is set to announce today that he has a new COVID task force that is calling for a national mask mandate to prove your servitude, contact tracing, forced inoculations coming, but most importantly, a new lockdown.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:31.941]  That way he can say that Trump is to blame for COVID and claim that only a new lockdown will stop COVID.
[01:24:31.941 --> 01:24:37.962]  Then of course, when that new lockdown doesn't work, those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it.
[01:24:37.962 --> 01:24:42.123]  And that's when all the mass arrests start sometime towards the end of next year.
[01:24:42.123 --> 01:24:44.703]  This is a permanent martial law plan.
[01:24:44.703 --> 01:24:50.204]  Trump must repudiate it, expose Fauci and Gates, and the UN takeover, not play games with it.
[01:24:50.204 --> 01:24:52.665]  America is in crisis.
[01:24:52.665 --> 01:24:54.065]  Emergency lockdown.
[01:24:54.705 --> 01:24:55.666]  I think so.
[01:25:16.676 --> 01:25:17.617]  We're good to go.
[01:25:35.518 --> 01:25:44.142]  Look, we all know that CNN is the epitome of fake news, but there's a headline on their site today that says, there are disinformation groups and organizations saying Joe Biden is not president-elect.
[01:26:02.841 --> 01:26:14.949]  Well, on its face, he's not president-elect, because the votes have not been certified by any of the 50 states, and counting is still going on, what, in seven of the states?
[01:26:14.949 --> 01:26:18.251]  And Trump is gaining ground in all but one of them.
[01:26:19.071 --> 01:26:24.676]  And then there's also going to be recounts, audits, and all the spot checks have already shown NASA fraud.
[01:26:24.676 --> 01:26:28.380]  But, in comes the ace card, the ace of spades.
[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:38.549]  Big tech censorship is blocking not just the President, not just members of Congress, but tens of millions of Americans from even sharing local news stations confirming the fraud.
[01:26:38.549 --> 01:26:42.193]  This is a foreign-backed, multinational takeover of the United States.
[01:26:42.193 --> 01:26:44.014]  Trump is battling a Chinese-backed,
[01:26:44.935 --> 01:26:53.059]  New World Order says to bet on keeping us locked down forever in an economic war and bring us to our knees.
[01:26:53.059 --> 01:26:55.681]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:27:14.662 --> 01:27:25.168]  So a scientific dictatorship has been established by the robber barons of the eugenicists, and they believe they're saving the earth from humans, and it's their right to do horrible things and do terrible things and consolidate control.
[01:27:25.168 --> 01:27:33.953]  And that's the attitude of these people, but they're Satanists, they're very dark, they're very wicked, and they just want power and control.
[01:27:33.953 --> 01:27:36.414]  And they aren't going to stop until we stop them.
[01:27:36.414 --> 01:27:38.555]  People wonder, like, why do the communists do what they do?
[01:27:38.555 --> 01:27:39.736]  Why do the Nazis do what they do?
[01:27:39.736 --> 01:27:40.917]  Why do Genghis Khan do what they do?
[01:27:42.961 --> 01:27:44.402]  Because they always want more power.
[01:27:44.402 --> 01:27:45.723]  They always want more control.
[01:27:45.723 --> 01:27:48.184]  They get off on running your life.
[01:27:48.184 --> 01:27:49.725]  I want to open the phones up.
[01:27:49.725 --> 01:27:50.985]  I have Ezra Levant joining us.
[01:27:50.985 --> 01:27:55.348]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:27:55.348 --> 01:27:56.929]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:27:56.929 --> 01:27:57.829]  877-789-2539.
[01:27:57.829 --> 01:27:59.590]  On Trump, the election, all of it.
[01:27:59.590 --> 01:28:01.832]  But this is the globalist takeover.
[01:28:01.832 --> 01:28:04.733]  We launched Trump trying to block their globalist takeover.
[01:28:04.733 --> 01:28:07.535]  That was the organic, psychic, spiritual resistance.
[01:28:08.541 --> 01:28:10.682]  Let's go back to this medical doctor.
[01:28:28.379 --> 01:28:29.099]  He does a great job.
[01:28:29.099 --> 01:28:30.300]  Everybody knows who this guy is.
[01:28:30.300 --> 01:28:32.361]  We were going to have him on one day, and then we got the wires crossed.
[01:28:32.361 --> 01:28:33.602]  I'm going to try to get him back on sometime.
[01:28:33.602 --> 01:28:34.122]  I apologize.
[01:28:34.122 --> 01:28:34.803]  We didn't get him on that day.
[01:28:34.803 --> 01:28:35.903]  We had him set.
[01:28:35.903 --> 01:28:48.571]  Let's go back to Dr. Bataar, medical doctor, laying out this incredible tyranny and how they're predicting the Labour Party of Canada, and it's the same thing with the UN, that, oh, a new, more deadly one's coming, you see?
[01:28:48.571 --> 01:28:49.891]  It's always more deadly.
[01:28:49.891 --> 01:28:51.312]  It's all premeditated.
[01:28:51.312 --> 01:28:52.173]  It's all a takeover.
[01:28:52.173 --> 01:28:54.694]  Just, oh, put the handcuffs on for 15 days.
[01:28:54.694 --> 01:28:55.855]  Ten months later, handcuffs are on.
[01:28:56.275 --> 01:28:57.395]  Oh, we let it off for a while.
[01:28:57.395 --> 01:28:59.056]  Now it's going to come back even tighter.
[01:28:59.056 --> 01:29:01.477]  But don't worry, we're going to let go the next time.
[01:29:01.477 --> 01:29:03.898]  Let us put you in handcuffs.
[01:29:03.898 --> 01:29:06.859]  That's actually how men train women for sex abuse.
[01:29:06.859 --> 01:29:08.219]  They go, oh, it's a bondage party.
[01:29:08.219 --> 01:29:09.340]  Here, put handcuffs on.
[01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:10.120]  There's nice women here.
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.181]  It'll be safe.
[01:29:11.181 --> 01:29:12.161]  Six months later, you're there.
[01:29:12.161 --> 01:29:12.621]  Nobody's there.
[01:29:12.621 --> 01:29:13.401]  You put the handcuffs on.
[01:29:13.401 --> 01:29:14.842]  He goes, listen, I'm going to kill you now.
[01:29:16.092 --> 01:29:22.595]  I told you that about Weinstein and the Globalists and people like them is that, remember the Huffington Post attacked me?
[01:29:22.595 --> 01:29:26.296]  And I said, the word is they brand women right down the bikini line.
[01:29:26.296 --> 01:29:28.837]  There's this whole group of cults, the Clintons, and people run.
[01:29:28.837 --> 01:29:30.618]  The Brothmans are involved, I was told.
[01:29:30.618 --> 01:29:32.139]  It's all on record.
[01:29:32.139 --> 01:29:36.621]  And they keep telling women, go to these parties, get in handcuffs, 50 Shades of Grey.
[01:29:36.621 --> 01:29:43.204]  And then finally, you're not at a party, and you get tied up, and you never get untied.
[01:29:43.204 --> 01:29:43.984]  You get chopped up.
[01:29:45.609 --> 01:29:50.252]  You don't just think they're raping women, right?
[01:29:50.252 --> 01:29:54.015]  But there was a Huffington Post, oh, Jones is insane, they're branding women.
[01:29:54.015 --> 01:29:55.116]  Remember that four years ago?
[01:29:55.116 --> 01:29:58.778]  Because we're wondering, how does Jones know all this?
[01:29:58.778 --> 01:30:00.459]  Well, I mean, we do the research.
[01:30:00.459 --> 01:30:02.141]  We know who you are.
[01:30:02.141 --> 01:30:03.882]  So they want to suppress us all.
[01:30:03.882 --> 01:30:05.583]  They want to put a mask on us all.
[01:30:05.583 --> 01:30:12.748]  They want to gag us because they're big, fat, demonic creatures that just, when I say big and fat, I mean just like, ugh, nasty.
[01:30:12.748 --> 01:30:13.849]  They want, they're just creepy.
[01:30:14.872 --> 01:30:19.094]  But we won't stand up to them, so Fauci and Gates and all of them are going to screw us.
[01:30:19.094 --> 01:30:22.175]  They're going to rape us with deadly needles full of deadly poison.
[01:30:22.175 --> 01:30:26.396]  And track everywhere we go and take our businesses and bankrupt us because we're not essential.
[01:30:26.396 --> 01:30:28.177]  Because why should they just sell products to all of us?
[01:30:28.177 --> 01:30:29.337]  Those are Trojan horses.
[01:30:29.337 --> 01:30:32.318]  They want control over everything.
[01:30:32.318 --> 01:30:37.000]  And when you implode something and you've got all the money and power, now your wealth gets bigger.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:39.521]  As we collapse, they can buy us up for nothing.
[01:30:41.513 --> 01:30:44.135]  So you trust these people and it only gets worse.
[01:30:44.135 --> 01:30:46.537]  It's not getting better until we wake up.
[01:30:46.537 --> 01:30:47.998]  We're not in Kansas anymore.
[01:30:47.998 --> 01:30:49.599]  We're not going back where we were.
[01:30:49.599 --> 01:30:52.081]  They've told you it's never going to end.
[01:30:52.081 --> 01:30:55.223]  It's going to end when they end up in a big Nuremberg trial.
[01:30:55.223 --> 01:30:58.586]  When they end up being punished for what they've done.
[01:30:58.586 --> 01:30:59.206]  Remember that.
[01:30:59.206 --> 01:31:02.449]  Geneva Convention against Illegal Secret Testing.
[01:31:02.449 --> 01:31:03.549]  Nuremberg Code.
[01:31:03.549 --> 01:31:04.770]  This is Nazi stuff.
[01:31:04.770 --> 01:31:06.171]  This is Angel of Death.
[01:31:06.171 --> 01:31:06.972]  Joseph Mengele.
[01:31:06.972 --> 01:31:08.033]  This is all textbook.
[01:31:09.477 --> 01:31:19.462]  All we need is some strong governors, and some strong legislators, and some strong pastors, and some strong black leaders, and white leaders, and Hispanic leaders to stand up and say no!
[01:31:19.462 --> 01:31:21.883]  Like this Archbishop that's come out and knocked it out of the park.
[01:31:21.883 --> 01:31:24.524]  And Bolsonaro, and Trump's finally getting it.
[01:31:24.524 --> 01:31:25.665]  Day late, dollar short.
[01:31:25.665 --> 01:31:28.006]  And Trump let him censor us.
[01:31:28.006 --> 01:31:31.388]  He was too confident.
[01:31:31.388 --> 01:31:32.188]  It doesn't matter.
[01:31:32.188 --> 01:31:33.169]  We wish we still had him.
[01:31:33.169 --> 01:31:33.849]  Hopefully we get him.
[01:31:36.607 --> 01:31:38.509]  In a way, let it get worse.
[01:31:38.509 --> 01:31:39.270]  Let them come.
[01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.870]  You'll see.
[01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:44.835]  They're already on El Paso TV saying, we're going to arrest you if you don't take your shot.
[01:31:44.835 --> 01:31:48.698]  We're coming to take you to a facility.
[01:31:48.698 --> 01:31:50.620]  This is the doctors we trust.
[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:54.404]  Not normal doctors, special doctors appointed for their evil.
[01:31:54.404 --> 01:31:55.605]  Let's go back to the video of the doctor.
[01:31:56.988 --> 01:32:12.258]  Projected COVID-19 mutation and or co-infection with secondary virus, referred to as COVID-21, leading to a third wave with much higher mortality rate and higher rate of infection, expected by February 2021.
[01:32:12.258 --> 01:32:21.324]  Daily new cases of COVID-21 hospitalizations and COVID-19 and COVID-21 related deaths will exceed medical facility capacities expected by Q1-Q2 of 2021.
[01:32:26.075 --> 01:32:30.499]  Enhanced lockdown restrictions, referred to as third lockdown, will be implemented.
[01:32:30.499 --> 01:32:34.843]  Full travel restrictions will be imposed, including inter-province and inter-city.
[01:32:34.843 --> 01:32:36.144]  Expected by Q2 2021.
[01:32:36.144 --> 01:32:37.945]  Guys, understand that.
[01:32:37.945 --> 01:32:43.931]  That means that if you're in British Columbia, you can't go to Quebec.
[01:32:43.931 --> 01:32:44.992]  Alright?
[01:32:44.992 --> 01:32:46.333]  This is what they're talking about.
[01:32:46.333 --> 01:32:51.898]  And if you're in one city and you're trying to go into another city in the same province, they're not going to allow you to do that.
[01:32:53.004 --> 01:32:57.027]  This is in Canada, of course they're going to try to roll this out and I'll get to that point here in a second.
[01:33:03.092 --> 01:33:08.094]  Transitioning of individuals into the Universal Basic Income Program.
[01:33:08.094 --> 01:33:11.335]  Expected mid-quarter to 2021.
[01:33:11.335 --> 01:33:21.058]  Projected supply chain breakdowns in inventory storage, large economic instability, all expected late second quarter 2021.
[01:33:21.058 --> 01:33:28.701]  Deployment of military personnel into major metropolitan areas as well as all major roadways to establish travel checkpoints.
[01:33:28.701 --> 01:33:32.282]  Restrict travel and movement, provide logistical support to the area,
[01:33:32.742 --> 01:33:37.185]  Alright guys, this is where it gets really disturbing.
[01:33:37.185 --> 01:33:38.726]  As if it's not already disturbing.
[01:33:38.726 --> 01:33:39.406]  What we are told
[01:33:59.673 --> 01:34:10.010]  Was that in order to offset what was essentially an economic collapse on an international scale, that the federal government was going to offer Canadians a total debt relief.
[01:34:10.010 --> 01:34:11.373]  So people are getting excited about that.
[01:34:11.373 --> 01:34:12.655]  That sounds good.
[01:34:12.655 --> 01:34:12.995]  But wait.
[01:34:14.363 --> 01:34:15.183]  This is how it works.
[01:34:15.183 --> 01:34:21.946]  The federal government will offer to eliminate all personal debts, all mortgages, all loans, all credit cards, etc.
[01:34:21.946 --> 01:34:29.450]  which all funding will be provided to Canada by the IMF under what will become known as the World Debt Reset Program.
[01:34:29.450 --> 01:34:38.314]  In exchange for acceptance of this total debt forgiveness, the individual would forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever.
[01:34:39.232 --> 01:34:49.235]  In exchange for acceptance of this total debt forgiveness, the individual would forfeit ownership of any and all property and assets forever!
[01:34:51.428 --> 01:35:05.596]  The individual would also have to agree to partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule, which will provide the individual with unrestricted travel and unrestricted living, even under a full lockdown.
[01:35:05.596 --> 01:35:16.742]  So, if you agree, you can go do anything you're doing, as long as you partake in the COVID-19 and COVID-21 vaccination schedule, regardless of the lockdown, magically you take this vaccine and boom!
[01:35:16.742 --> 01:35:17.162]  Guess what?
[01:35:17.702 --> 01:35:22.786]  You don't have to social distance, you don't have to wear a mask anymore because you have already gotten your vaccines.
[01:35:22.786 --> 01:35:23.627]  All right?
[01:35:23.627 --> 01:35:33.395]  So this is unrestricted living even under a full lockdown through the use of a photo identification referred to as Canada's Health Pass.
[01:35:33.395 --> 01:35:43.423]  Committee members asked who would become the owner of the forfeited property and assets in that scenario and what would happen to lenders or financial institutions
[01:35:45.157 --> 01:35:48.662]  We were simply told the World Debt Reset Program will handle all of the details.
[01:35:48.662 --> 01:35:54.270]  So when they were asked what happens to the property and what happens to the banks, don't worry about it, we're going to take care of it.
[01:35:54.270 --> 01:35:57.775]  That's what they were told.
[01:35:57.775 --> 01:36:01.280]  Alright, and now it gets really, really interesting.
[01:36:02.830 --> 01:36:04.091]  Wow.
[01:36:04.091 --> 01:36:07.673]  Committee members asked, who would become, I'm sorry, excuse me, I read that.
[01:36:07.673 --> 01:36:16.880]  Several committee members also questioned what would happen to individuals if they refused to participate in the World Debt Reset Program or the Health Pass or the vaccination schedule.
[01:36:17.762 --> 01:36:21.065]  The answer we got was very troubling.
[01:36:21.065 --> 01:36:32.515]  Essentially, we were told it was our duty to make sure we come up with a plan, meaning the Liberal Party was told that it was their duty to come up with a plan to ensure that would never happen.
[01:36:32.515 --> 01:36:37.640]  We were told it was in the individual's best interest to participate.
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:42.965]  When several committee members pushed relentlessly to get an answer... I want to come back and finish this up and go to your phone calls.
[01:36:44.693 --> 01:36:46.197]  Get ready for the news about Fred.
[01:36:46.197 --> 01:36:47.100]  Get ready for this information.
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:48.664]  You're not going to believe this next piece of information.
[01:36:49.642 --> 01:36:51.903]  Talk about tomorrow's news today.
[01:36:51.903 --> 01:36:55.084]  This is all very transparent when you war game it out.
[01:36:55.084 --> 01:37:00.745]  Six months ago, InfoWars predicted that the mail-in ballots would be used to steal the election from Trump.
[01:37:00.745 --> 01:37:08.787]  They would simply pause the voting at night and then have an unlimited number that they had in reserve to bring forward in battleground states to secure the victory.
[01:37:08.787 --> 01:37:09.928]  And now that happened.
[01:37:09.928 --> 01:37:14.949]  Now what else did I predict a few months ago and again last week and again last night, all on record?
[01:37:14.949 --> 01:37:17.030]  That when Joe Biden was president-elect,
[01:37:17.930 --> 01:37:18.551]  We're good to go.
[01:37:48.991 --> 01:37:50.172]  Remember Hillary Clinton?
[01:37:50.172 --> 01:37:51.093]  Remember Pelosi?
[01:37:51.093 --> 01:37:52.074]  Remember Bill Clinton?
[01:37:52.074 --> 01:37:53.475]  Remember Obama?
[01:37:53.475 --> 01:37:58.259]  All of them said, we are not going to concede if there's a red mirage.
[01:37:58.259 --> 01:38:02.182]  We believe it's going to look like Trump's going to win in a landslide if they have the internal polls.
[01:38:02.182 --> 01:38:07.026]  And indeed, Trump won most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin.
[01:38:07.026 --> 01:38:09.509]  And when he was set to win the other ones, they froze.
[01:38:10.169 --> 01:38:10.369]  I think?
[01:38:32.245 --> 01:38:34.747]  Officials are on record saying we've already found fraud.
[01:38:34.747 --> 01:38:37.028]  So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in.
[01:38:37.028 --> 01:38:40.970]  They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time, because the last hoax failed.
[01:38:40.970 --> 01:38:45.113]  But now, this is the mother of all hoaxes, and if they get away with this, it's the end of America.
[01:38:45.113 --> 01:38:47.274]  As we know it, we will beat Venezuela.
[01:38:47.274 --> 01:38:48.035]  Infowars.com
[01:38:50.066 --> 01:38:57.449]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired and even worshipped for thousands of years by ancient civilizations.
[01:38:57.449 --> 01:39:00.810]  With modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular.
[01:39:00.810 --> 01:39:07.813]  Its antioxidant effect, its anti-inflammatory effect, everything it does is simply amazing.
[01:39:07.813 --> 01:39:11.354]  And most turmerics out there are simply food products.
[01:39:11.354 --> 01:39:17.397]  They're 3-5% curcuminoid, but we have body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:39:18.317 --> 01:39:18.437]  Yeah.
[01:39:35.774 --> 01:39:36.395]  We're good to go.
[01:40:01.089 --> 01:40:05.372]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[01:40:05.372 --> 01:40:08.875]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[01:40:08.875 --> 01:40:12.157]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[01:40:12.157 --> 01:40:15.700]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:17.942]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[01:40:17.942 --> 01:40:19.343]  I suggest Band.Video.
[01:40:20.023 --> 01:40:25.486]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[01:40:25.486 --> 01:40:33.971]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[01:40:33.971 --> 01:40:40.675]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[01:40:40.675 --> 01:40:43.477]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[01:40:53.138 --> 01:40:55.753]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:22.404 --> 01:41:23.625]  Alex Jones here live.
[01:41:23.625 --> 01:41:26.926]  We're taking your phone calls right now for the next few segments.
[01:41:26.926 --> 01:41:31.589]  And then we've got Ezra Levant, who's up in Canada with Rebel Media.
[01:41:31.589 --> 01:41:35.250]  He's going to be joining us coming up.
[01:41:35.250 --> 01:41:37.111]  Again, I've just leveled with you today.
[01:41:37.111 --> 01:41:38.972]  I've really told you what's coming down.
[01:41:38.972 --> 01:41:42.734]  We already knew this was going to happen, but these people are going to go for total broke.
[01:41:42.734 --> 01:41:45.916]  They sit up with their hair all done, wearing their little suits.
[01:41:45.916 --> 01:41:50.578]  But a lot of psychopaths dress up in suits, too, because they can pick up women and take them to torture facilities.
[01:41:51.701 --> 01:42:08.851]  That's what these psychos do, is they sit there and say the most insane things straight up to you, and because they're so extreme, you don't respond back in an extreme way.
[01:42:08.851 --> 01:42:12.613]  They set the precedent, they move forward.
[01:42:12.613 --> 01:42:18.176]  So we've kicked God out of our lives, and Satan came into the room, and now the door just shut.
[01:42:19.437 --> 01:42:19.977]  We have to face it.
[01:42:19.977 --> 01:42:22.398]  I'm going to go to your phone calls just briefly.
[01:42:22.398 --> 01:42:25.179]  A lot of you bought storable food.
[01:42:25.179 --> 01:42:28.580]  We've got the best company that has the highest quality food for the lowest prices you're going to find.
[01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:32.641]  There's some stuff even better that costs four or five times more, but for what you pay, it's good food.
[01:42:32.641 --> 01:42:33.902]  It's high quality.
[01:42:33.902 --> 01:42:35.742]  It's got great containers, very portable.
[01:42:35.742 --> 01:42:36.762]  It's what I use for my family.
[01:42:36.762 --> 01:42:39.883]  And I can tell you, I'm going to be ordering more food now.
[01:42:39.883 --> 01:42:43.645]  I feel really good about telling you the last six months to get storable food.
[01:42:43.645 --> 01:42:45.045]  And there's not a wait now.
[01:42:45.045 --> 01:42:47.966]  By the time folks figure out we're in lockdown too, they're getting ready to start.
[01:42:48.874 --> 01:42:53.738]  By the time the food supply breaks down, I've talked to truckers all over the country already.
[01:42:53.738 --> 01:42:57.180]  They've got supply chain breakdowns that are worse than eight months ago.
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:43:01.904]  By the time folks figure it out, there's going to be rationing, there's going to be breakdown, I believe.
[01:43:01.904 --> 01:43:07.388]  You need to get a four-week, a three-month, a six-month, a year, whatever you can afford now.
[01:43:07.388 --> 01:43:11.011]  It funds the info war, and you get high-quality, affordable food at the lowest price you're going to find.
[01:43:12.213 --> 01:43:14.414]  Preparewithalex.com.
[01:43:14.414 --> 01:43:15.895]  Preparewithalex.com.
[01:43:15.895 --> 01:43:21.758]  You can go to InfoWars.com, get the full catalog of my Patreon at the lowest prices they sell.
[01:43:21.758 --> 01:43:24.920]  But under the contracts I have with them, because they have a lot of distributors,
[01:43:26.027 --> 01:43:32.552]  I can do specials and go even lower than they sell themselves or the distributors do with specials.
[01:43:32.552 --> 01:43:37.696]  So they've not just got the four-week supply, $100 off at preparewithalex.com.
[01:43:37.696 --> 01:43:43.621]  They have a bunch of other specials, the lowest of the low prices you're going to find at preparewithalex.com.
[01:43:43.621 --> 01:43:47.905]  Everything else is going to be the next lowest price that's available at infowrestore.com.
[01:43:47.905 --> 01:43:50.267]  But I would get your storable food orders in now.
[01:43:50.267 --> 01:43:51.608]  They're shipping within a day or two.
[01:43:52.762 --> 01:43:55.803]  And they're buying food forward, knowing that this is coming down.
[01:43:55.803 --> 01:43:59.865]  So, I hope everything, blue skies come up.
[01:43:59.865 --> 01:44:02.466]  Now, you know that's not about to happen.
[01:44:02.466 --> 01:44:07.888]  You need 25-year, portable, high-quality, storable food you can store and move.
[01:44:09.051 --> 01:44:11.511]  Infowarsstore.com, preparewithalex.com.
[01:44:11.511 --> 01:44:15.832]  We have the big stop lockdown twos, stop the steel sale.
[01:44:15.832 --> 01:44:25.334]  And infowarsstore.com, you need DNA Force Plus, you need X2, you need Body's Ultimate Tumor Formula, you need Natural Defense, you need X2.
[01:44:25.334 --> 01:44:26.174]  They're all amazing.
[01:44:26.174 --> 01:44:27.435]  Alpha Power, people are loving that.
[01:44:27.435 --> 01:44:28.315]  It's been sold out for a year.
[01:44:28.315 --> 01:44:30.555]  It was called Anthroplex before.
[01:44:30.555 --> 01:44:33.976]  It's just super high quality herbs for your libido, your stamina.
[01:44:35.009 --> 01:44:37.550]  It's got a bunch of patented special stuff in it.
[01:44:37.550 --> 01:44:41.232]  Look up the ingredients list at InfoWareStore.com for Alpha Power.
[01:44:41.232 --> 01:44:42.312]  It's back in stock.
[01:44:42.312 --> 01:44:43.593]  That's how we fund the operation.
[01:44:43.593 --> 01:44:44.754]  I want to thank you all.
[01:44:44.754 --> 01:44:46.995]  Water filtration, air filtration, all of it is there.
[01:44:46.995 --> 01:44:51.077]  Thank you for keeping us on air for this moment we're in right now.
[01:44:51.077 --> 01:44:52.517]  This is epic.
[01:44:52.517 --> 01:44:55.779]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to some phone calls here.
[01:44:56.834 --> 01:44:58.475]  Appreciate you calling in.
[01:44:58.475 --> 01:45:00.396]  Really appreciate you holding.
[01:45:00.396 --> 01:45:06.158]  Let's go ahead and we got Rick, we got Josh, we got Taylor, we got Todd, we got Chase, we got Mark and others.
[01:45:06.158 --> 01:45:07.379]  Let's go to Rick in Indiana.
[01:45:07.379 --> 01:45:09.540]  Rick, thanks for holding.
[01:45:09.540 --> 01:45:11.101]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:45:11.101 --> 01:45:25.107]  On November 1st, 2020, the CDC officially told all Americans that people who had recently tested positive for COVID and were currently in quarantine were free to go in person to the election polls and vote.
[01:45:25.689 --> 01:45:33.335]  My wife and I voted a local church here in Indianapolis, and we could not go to any church for much of 2020 because of COVID.
[01:45:33.335 --> 01:45:50.588]  Nevertheless, the CDC announced via the media, including CNN and Microsoft News MSN, that COVID-positive persons who were in quarantine were free to go into polling places inside churches all across our country, along with massive lines of uninfected voters.
[01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:59.896]  And these COVID infected people under quarantine could do this in order to protect the COVID positive voters constitutional right to vote.
[01:45:59.896 --> 01:46:17.488]  However, our first amendment constitutional rights to worship Jesus Christ in our churches here in Indianapolis during most of 2020 has been violated in an ongoing and massive way by our Republican governor, Eric Holcomb, and our Democrat mayor, Joe Hogsett.
[01:46:17.901 --> 01:46:31.356]  Furthermore, our Attorney General, Curtis Hill, here in Indiana, wrote an amazing legal opinion detailing this exact unconstitutional denial of our First Amendment rights to worship God in our churches.
[01:46:31.966 --> 01:46:40.871]  And the Attorney General's opinion verified these completely unconstitutional acts by both Governor Eric Holcomb and Mayor Joe Hogsett.
[01:46:40.871 --> 01:46:52.838]  Again, wasn't COVID the entire reason for mail-in ballots, which, as President Trump predicted, have now produced massive voter fraud on a scale we have never seen before here in the United States?
[01:46:52.838 --> 01:46:57.841]  Citizens were told we had to have massive fraudulent mail-in ballots to protect us from COVID.
[01:46:58.752 --> 01:47:19.979]  But now CDC's actions urging COVID positive people who were in quarantine to go in person and vote at polls located inside churches all across our nation has fully and forever exposed the entire COVID hoax and the massive deep state voter fraud of mail-in ballots in one single revealing act by the deep state and the CDC.
[01:47:22.042 --> 01:47:23.143]  Well, let me just say this.
[01:47:23.143 --> 01:47:25.044]  You want to be hired as a writer for InfoWars?
[01:47:25.044 --> 01:47:26.125]  That's total truth.
[01:47:26.125 --> 01:47:27.205]  Give this guy's name and number.
[01:47:27.205 --> 01:47:29.067]  I'd love to have you on as a guest.
[01:47:29.067 --> 01:47:30.628]  Callers are so incredible, but absolutely.
[01:47:31.687 --> 01:47:35.429]  With the left, it's all about killing common sense.
[01:47:35.429 --> 01:47:41.553]  Like, our churches can't be open, but bars can be open, or the porno shops, or Walmart.
[01:47:41.553 --> 01:47:48.537]  But then, your small business can't be, and now we're going to send contact tracers like they did in Europe to make sure you're not having too big a Christmas party.
[01:47:48.537 --> 01:47:53.300]  They all want to get good people that follow the rules to follow illegal rules.
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:54.300]  Well, you know, I
[01:48:21.154 --> 01:48:34.745]  First of all, I'm honored that you would say that because I would do anything to help this movement of the people of the United States who are trying their hearts out to honor God.
[01:48:34.745 --> 01:48:46.174]  And you know what's great about Trump is when he stands up at these rallies and he says, you know, minority unemployment is at the lowest rate, you know, in years and decades.
[01:48:46.174 --> 01:48:49.337]  And we're all saying, yay, you know, we want to get together.
[01:48:50.118 --> 01:48:51.599]  We want to have a great country.
[01:48:51.599 --> 01:48:56.280]  He's saying, you know, Latino unemployment is at the lowest rate.
[01:48:56.280 --> 01:48:58.261]  And the enemy wants to divide us.
[01:48:58.261 --> 01:49:00.361]  It's so obvious that they're evil.
[01:49:00.361 --> 01:49:01.842]  It's so obvious they're bad.
[01:49:01.842 --> 01:49:03.402]  And that's what it comes down to.
[01:49:03.402 --> 01:49:04.723]  Hey, we're doing that show soon.
[01:49:04.723 --> 01:49:05.463]  We're getting all the names.
[01:49:05.463 --> 01:49:06.123]  Get his name and number.
[01:49:06.123 --> 01:49:07.443]  I want to get him on as a guest.
[01:49:07.443 --> 01:49:08.604]  We're going to start.
[01:49:08.604 --> 01:49:08.904]  You know what?
[01:49:10.083 --> 01:49:12.264]  I'm going to get back Sunday, but start next weekend.
[01:49:12.264 --> 01:49:13.164]  I'm doing a Saturday show.
[01:49:13.164 --> 01:49:14.805]  We do take calls.
[01:49:14.805 --> 01:49:16.185]  We have special callers on with us.
[01:49:16.185 --> 01:49:16.926]  I appreciate you.
[01:49:16.926 --> 01:49:19.327]  I get to all these other folks, Rick, that you're dead on.
[01:49:19.327 --> 01:49:21.167]  This is a power grab.
[01:49:21.167 --> 01:49:22.468]  They've lied at every level.
[01:49:22.468 --> 01:49:23.928]  It's a hoax.
[01:49:23.928 --> 01:49:24.969]  But it's the corporate
[01:49:25.851 --> 01:49:32.892]  Bureaucracy with the blue states, blue cities, and leftist political parties worldwide, forcing their will on us.
[01:49:32.892 --> 01:49:33.652]  And they know it.
[01:49:33.652 --> 01:49:36.193]  Even their low-level people know it's a power grab.
[01:49:36.193 --> 01:49:41.014]  Well, what's the left going to think if Biden gets in and he keeps the lockdown going?
[01:49:41.014 --> 01:49:41.814]  They're delusional.
[01:49:41.814 --> 01:49:44.955]  They just decide to submit to it.
[01:49:44.955 --> 01:49:45.975]  John in North Carolina.
[01:49:45.975 --> 01:49:46.475]  Thanks for holding.
[01:49:46.475 --> 01:49:50.176]  Go ahead, John.
[01:49:50.176 --> 01:49:50.616]  Hey, John.
[01:49:50.616 --> 01:49:51.716]  Welcome, sir, from North Carolina.
[01:49:53.055 --> 01:49:54.576]  Hey, it's Josh, Alex.
[01:49:54.576 --> 01:49:55.536]  Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:49:55.536 --> 01:49:56.156]  I read this wrong.
[01:49:56.156 --> 01:49:56.436]  You're right.
[01:49:56.436 --> 01:49:57.336]  It's Josh.
[01:49:57.336 --> 01:49:58.177]  I apologize, sir.
[01:49:58.177 --> 01:49:59.297]  You're fine, man.
[01:49:59.297 --> 01:49:59.937]  No problem.
[01:49:59.937 --> 01:50:01.858]  Hey, quick question for you.
[01:50:01.858 --> 01:50:04.779]  I'm making the travel up tomorrow to D.C.
[01:50:04.779 --> 01:50:14.102]  from North Carolina, and I believe Ali Alexander put on Parler that we'll be meeting at Freedom Park.
[01:50:14.102 --> 01:50:15.842]  Is that correct?
[01:50:15.842 --> 01:50:16.363]  I believe so.
[01:50:16.363 --> 01:50:17.923]  Yes, sir.
[01:50:17.923 --> 01:50:18.483]  Okay.
[01:50:18.483 --> 01:50:19.984]  I just wanted to nail that down.
[01:50:21.562 --> 01:50:24.765]  At noon tomorrow, we meet by the White House.
[01:50:24.765 --> 01:50:26.826]  And then we, because they got a fence around the White House.
[01:50:26.826 --> 01:50:28.027]  That's as close as you can get.
[01:50:28.027 --> 01:50:29.748]  I'm in a hotel right by it.
[01:50:29.748 --> 01:50:32.931]  And then we're going to march down to the Supreme Court.
[01:50:32.931 --> 01:50:33.471]  Yes, sir.
[01:50:33.471 --> 01:50:33.912]  All right.
[01:50:33.912 --> 01:50:34.572]  Sounds great.
[01:50:34.572 --> 01:50:38.335]  I'll be looking for you guys in the morning.
[01:50:38.335 --> 01:50:41.878]  Now, the previous caller was excellent.
[01:50:41.878 --> 01:50:49.544]  To add to his point, a lot of what we're dealing with here in North Carolina, considering the lockdowns, it kind of depends on the region.
[01:50:50.923 --> 01:50:53.344]  North Carolina is so split.
[01:50:53.344 --> 01:50:55.744]  You know, a lot of your more rural countryside counties.
[01:50:55.744 --> 01:50:58.025]  Yeah, when you've got leftists, they keep you locked down.
[01:50:58.025 --> 01:51:00.566]  If you've got conservatives, they know, exactly.
[01:51:00.566 --> 01:51:02.966]  Right, exactly.
[01:51:02.966 --> 01:51:12.489]  But one thing, and I don't know if a lot of people are really paying as much attention, I know a lot of more people have gotten politically active this year, which is absolutely great.
[01:51:12.489 --> 01:51:18.150]  But they do need to be paying very close attention to your really local legislative
[01:51:19.651 --> 01:51:20.732]  Absolutely.
[01:51:20.732 --> 01:51:21.833]  The globalists know it.
[01:51:21.833 --> 01:51:23.315]  Everything is local.
[01:51:23.315 --> 01:51:24.616]  Act local, think global.
[01:51:37.609 --> 01:51:38.550]  Thank you so much, Jan.
[01:51:55.999 --> 01:52:12.603]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[01:52:12.603 --> 01:52:23.645]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[01:52:24.145 --> 01:52:32.639]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[01:52:32.639 --> 01:52:38.208]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:52:41.024 --> 01:52:46.189]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations, and different mixes of the two.
[01:52:46.189 --> 01:52:49.232]  One is born of renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[01:52:49.232 --> 01:52:58.320]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos, and a culture, and ingenuity, art, and skill, and strength.
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:03.705]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls, with a tiny elite above it.
[01:53:04.666 --> 01:53:12.755]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[01:53:12.755 --> 01:53:16.379]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[01:53:16.379 --> 01:53:20.644]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[01:53:21.204 --> 01:53:22.925]  A global permanent lockdown is here.
[01:53:22.925 --> 01:53:26.346]  It is already causing millions and millions to starve to death.
[01:53:26.346 --> 01:53:28.506]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[01:53:28.506 --> 01:53:36.369]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[01:53:36.369 --> 01:53:37.069]  That's the facts.
[01:53:37.069 --> 01:53:42.591]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[01:53:42.591 --> 01:53:45.212]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:02.253 --> 01:54:06.941]  All right, we have mega massive Trump news that's about to break.
[01:54:06.941 --> 01:54:12.450]  I am right down the street from the White House, Owen Troyer and my son Rex Jones, now a man 18 years.
[01:54:14.784 --> 01:54:16.025]  Are out there fighting hard.
[01:54:16.025 --> 01:54:18.846]  We got big news, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:18.846 --> 01:54:20.527]  And so, this is very exciting.
[01:54:20.527 --> 01:54:23.248]  Ezra Levant is coming up about 15 after.
[01:54:23.248 --> 01:54:26.610]  Let's go back to your calls right now.
[01:54:26.610 --> 01:54:29.392]  My wife is calling me, so I'm on the phone using that.
[01:54:29.392 --> 01:54:31.313]  Taylor, in New Jersey.
[01:54:31.313 --> 01:54:31.913]  You're on the air.
[01:54:31.913 --> 01:54:33.614]  Go ahead.
[01:54:33.614 --> 01:54:34.254]  Hello, Alex.
[01:54:34.254 --> 01:54:38.236]  I'm the breathwork guy that you said you would do a half-hour segment with.
[01:54:38.236 --> 01:54:38.636]  We do.
[01:54:38.636 --> 01:54:39.717]  We want to get you on soon.
[01:54:39.717 --> 01:54:40.477]  That's why we're going to start.
[01:54:40.477 --> 01:54:40.798]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:40.798 --> 01:54:41.338]  We want to get you on.
[01:54:42.352 --> 01:54:42.753]  Yes, sir.
[01:54:42.753 --> 01:54:43.113]  All right.
[01:54:43.113 --> 01:54:52.464]  What I want to say real quick was, I think that the left is, because the left obviously what they are, what they're aligned with, and that God creates itself and evil destroys itself.
[01:54:52.464 --> 01:54:55.167]  I feel like the left is winding up their people.
[01:54:55.167 --> 01:55:01.134]  They projected this win so that when Trump does win on the day of the eclipse, December 14th, when that all gets sorted out,
[01:55:01.594 --> 01:55:15.862]  I feel like it's just going to create bedlam in the streets, and that's why I feel like they're going right into the COVID news now to create a lockdown scenario in all those leftist areas, to lock those people down, to suppress them even more, so that they go crazy when Trump wins, to really stoke this civil war.
[01:55:15.862 --> 01:55:18.424]  And I feel like that's really what they've set up.
[01:55:18.424 --> 01:55:20.305]  I totally agree with you.
[01:55:20.305 --> 01:55:21.365]  I totally agree with you, sir.
[01:55:21.365 --> 01:55:23.486]  What else do you think is coming?
[01:55:23.486 --> 01:55:26.168]  I feel like what you were saying about the bio-attack thing, I feel like
[01:55:26.880 --> 01:55:30.842]  Just going with God here and looking at the alignments and God's handiwork here.
[01:55:30.842 --> 01:55:33.624]  There's a great conjunction on December 21st.
[01:55:33.624 --> 01:55:37.946]  And for me, my heart, I feel like they're going to try and do it.
[01:55:37.946 --> 01:55:42.908]  And as you said, the Bible says the evidence of God is in the firmament.
[01:55:42.908 --> 01:55:43.529]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:43.529 --> 01:55:44.509]  Psalms 19 and 1.
[01:55:44.509 --> 01:55:45.230]  Yes, sir.
[01:55:45.230 --> 01:55:54.094]  I feel like that on December 21st, from all the planets, from what I'm looking at astrologically, because that's just the handiwork of God, I feel like there's going to be an alignment.
[01:55:54.094 --> 01:55:55.335]  Obviously, there will be an alignment.
[01:55:56.036 --> 01:56:01.139]  On that day, they call it a great conjunction, it doesn't happen often, and it's a massive shift in the consciousness.
[01:56:01.139 --> 01:56:14.188]  I feel like there will be a coronal mass ejection on December 21st, and they'll call it a bio-attack, and all of the superpowers of the world will point fingers, and then they'll lock their people down, and then we'll really be in this thing.
[01:56:14.188 --> 01:56:18.951]  Well, I'll tell you, I look at the globalists, whether it's Zuckerberg, or whether it's... they look scared.
[01:56:18.951 --> 01:56:19.691]  Have you noticed that?
[01:56:19.691 --> 01:56:20.792]  They look really scared.
[01:56:20.792 --> 01:56:21.713]  What are they so scared of?
[01:56:23.709 --> 01:56:40.412]  I feel like they know that God, they are definitely aware of God, like you said, these people are not atheists, they're just, they have a malalignment or a misalignment, however you want to look at it, but these people are, you know, firmly aware that there is one source of power and all they can do is manipulate and try to
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:46.283]  Jade, the perspective of that power, but they're totally aware.
[01:56:46.283 --> 01:56:53.867]  I feel like they're just trying to get as many people as they can to create, you know, their flocks and try to absorb as much energy as they can while this is their time.
[01:56:53.867 --> 01:56:54.287]  This is it.
[01:56:54.287 --> 01:56:55.248]  This is their last shot.
[01:56:55.248 --> 01:56:59.430]  Like, this is the death throes of pure evil and, you know, in human form.
[01:56:59.430 --> 01:57:02.612]  And I think they're fully aware that, you know, love always wins.
[01:57:02.612 --> 01:57:03.272]  God always wins.
[01:57:03.272 --> 01:57:07.815]  It's just that through these challenges, we cultivate our divine nature.
[01:57:07.815 --> 01:57:10.056]  For us to reach heaven, we need these challenges.
[01:57:10.817 --> 01:57:11.517]  I hear you.
[01:57:11.517 --> 01:57:12.758]  I hear you, sir.
[01:57:12.758 --> 01:57:14.099]  Taylor, you make me feel so good.
[01:57:14.099 --> 01:57:15.560]  Josh, you make me feel so good.
[01:57:15.560 --> 01:57:18.701]  Nick, what you said is so beautiful because I just give it to God.
[01:57:18.701 --> 01:57:19.662]  I get so upset about this.
[01:57:19.662 --> 01:57:22.243]  I feel like I'm not doing enough, but we have to give it to God.
[01:57:22.243 --> 01:57:22.804]  Thank you so much.
[01:57:22.804 --> 01:57:23.924]  I really appreciate you.
[01:57:40.563 --> 01:57:43.604]  All right, we've got time to jam in one more quick call here.
[01:57:43.604 --> 01:57:45.844]  Let's go to Todd in Texas.
[01:57:45.844 --> 01:57:48.725]  Todd, thanks.
[01:57:48.725 --> 01:57:51.486]  Hey Alex, long time listener.
[01:57:51.486 --> 01:57:54.347]  Thank you, sir.
[01:57:54.347 --> 01:58:02.989]  Long time as in ACTV prank call days, but this is going to be quite a different call.
[01:58:02.989 --> 01:58:06.150]  I saw the live stream that you did with Tim Cole last night.
[01:58:06.150 --> 01:58:06.730]  Was that last night?
[01:58:08.648 --> 01:58:10.589]  To be honest with you, it was kind of sad, man.
[01:58:10.589 --> 01:58:11.450]  They didn't get it.
[01:58:11.450 --> 01:58:21.057]  You kept referencing Davos and the World Economic Forum, and I think the missing ingredient, you know, why do these globalists look so scared?
[01:58:21.057 --> 01:58:28.082]  People don't realize that Paul Krugman and other globalist economics have been forced to admit that globalization hurt America.
[01:58:29.045 --> 01:58:31.567]  There's a lot of articles... Hold on, don't hang up.
[01:58:31.567 --> 01:58:32.947]  Don't hang up, Todd.
[01:58:32.947 --> 01:58:35.749]  I'm gonna come right back to you in a few more callers.
[01:58:35.749 --> 01:58:38.671]  Chase and Mark, and then I've got Ezra Levant coming up.
[01:58:38.671 --> 01:58:43.994]  We have the big Trump announcement that just happened, coming up on the other side, back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:43.994 --> 01:58:48.196]  Newswars.com, band.video, infowars.com, tomorrow's news.
[01:58:48.196 --> 01:58:51.038]  DNA Force Plus, if you did one thing for your immune system...
[01:58:51.698 --> 01:58:53.259]  It would be get all the essential things.
[01:58:53.259 --> 01:58:55.601]  And that's the clean iodine, X2 or X3.
[01:58:55.601 --> 01:58:57.243]  That's the biotrichoselenium.
[01:58:57.243 --> 01:58:58.744]  That is the vitamin D3.
[01:58:58.744 --> 01:59:00.626]  That is the C. That is the zinc.
[01:59:00.626 --> 01:59:02.867]  There's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential without them you die.
[01:59:02.867 --> 01:59:04.429]  And studies show you really need the other ones too.
[01:59:04.429 --> 01:59:05.910]  But DNA force goes beyond that.
[01:59:05.910 --> 01:59:13.797]  It helps get all that in the cells and out the cells with PQQ and CoQ10 are the highest quality sources with other ingredients that clean out the cells.
[01:59:14.637 --> 01:59:17.460]  Unclog them so all that stuff can get in.
[01:59:17.460 --> 01:59:18.520]  Viruses don't get in.
[01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:19.561]  The good stuff gets in.
[01:59:19.561 --> 01:59:23.665]  As the NIH website says, that if you have all the proper things, they can't replicate like they could.
[01:59:23.665 --> 01:59:26.307]  But I do this because it's essential, like oxygen, like water.
[01:59:26.307 --> 01:59:28.469]  DNA Force sold out for months.
[01:59:28.469 --> 01:59:29.629]  50% off out of the gates.
[01:59:29.629 --> 01:59:30.670]  Triple Patriot Points.
[01:59:30.670 --> 01:59:31.531]  Free shipping.
[01:59:31.531 --> 01:59:32.932]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:59:32.932 --> 01:59:34.433]  DNA Force Election Special.
[01:59:34.433 --> 01:59:35.374]  That's gonna have to end in a week.
[01:59:35.374 --> 01:59:38.237]  We've got a limited supply and it was very hard to get the PQQ this time.
[01:59:38.237 --> 01:59:39.738]  A lot of our stuff isn't, can't get anymore.
[01:59:39.738 --> 01:59:42.500]  A lot of our products, because the supply chain's broken down, that's part of the global supply
[01:59:42.500 --> 01:59:43.120]  Well, President Trump
[02:00:05.862 --> 02:00:09.064]  One by a landslide four years ago, barely beat the fraud.
[02:00:09.064 --> 02:00:11.626]  This time, they froze the election, brought in the extra ballots.
[02:00:11.626 --> 02:00:13.667]  They've been caught red-handed.
[02:00:13.667 --> 02:00:16.269]  Plus, Biden's a CHICOM agent, so he's illegitimate regardless.
[02:00:16.269 --> 02:00:19.451]  But Trump just tweeted this 29 minutes ago.
[02:00:19.451 --> 02:00:24.294]  Heartwarming to see all of the... We'll put the tweet up on screen if we can.
[02:00:24.294 --> 02:00:28.677]  Heartwarming to see all of the tremendous support out there.
[02:00:29.517 --> 02:00:37.365]  Especially the organic rallies that are springing up all over the country, including the big one on Saturday in D.C.
[02:00:37.365 --> 02:00:40.308]  I may even try to stop by and say hello.
[02:00:40.308 --> 02:00:45.853]  The election was rigged from Dominion all the way up and down.
[02:00:45.853 --> 02:00:46.433]  And so that's good.
[02:00:47.298 --> 02:00:49.439]  Because that's why this is huge.
[02:00:49.439 --> 02:00:51.180]  Trump is building the evidence of fraud.
[02:00:51.180 --> 02:00:52.281]  It's there.
[02:00:52.281 --> 02:00:52.942]  It's incredible.
[02:00:52.942 --> 02:00:54.923]  I can't even keep track of there so much.
[02:00:54.923 --> 02:00:58.965]  And the blocking poll watchers and not certifying machines and flipping numbers.
[02:00:58.965 --> 02:01:00.726]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:01:00.726 --> 02:01:06.390]  That's why they're targeting his lawyers and threatening him to quit because they know they're in trouble.
[02:01:06.390 --> 02:01:11.393]  That's why they just keep like, you know, the Pope like, oh, Joe Biden's the greatest Catholic.
[02:01:11.393 --> 02:01:12.334]  He's pro-abortion.
[02:01:12.334 --> 02:01:14.195]  I mean, this is sick.
[02:01:14.195 --> 02:01:15.476]  That's not a real Pope, folks.
[02:01:16.718 --> 02:01:19.019]  I mean, I'm not Catholic, but I studied the Catholic Church.
[02:01:19.019 --> 02:01:20.179]  It's very famous, very important.
[02:01:20.179 --> 02:01:21.160]  I have a lot of friends that are Catholics.
[02:01:21.160 --> 02:01:26.222]  They do great work.
[02:01:26.222 --> 02:01:29.943]  Pope John Paul II was like 180 degrees away from this pope.
[02:01:29.943 --> 02:01:31.124]  He helped defeat communism.
[02:01:31.124 --> 02:01:32.164]  He was pro-life.
[02:01:32.164 --> 02:01:34.826]  And this new pope runs all these pedophile rings.
[02:01:34.826 --> 02:01:36.566]  I mean, that's not a pope, folks.
[02:01:36.566 --> 02:01:38.567]  That is a literal imposter.
[02:01:38.567 --> 02:01:40.148]  Whatever your church has been or was,
[02:01:41.224 --> 02:01:42.004]  This guy's bad.
[02:01:42.004 --> 02:01:43.545]  And Catholics see that.
[02:01:43.545 --> 02:01:44.465]  And it's the same thing.
[02:01:44.465 --> 02:01:47.707]  If your Protestant churches are speaking up, they're bad.
[02:01:47.707 --> 02:01:49.727]  If your universities are speaking up, they're bad.
[02:01:49.727 --> 02:01:52.568]  It's time for us to stop bowing to them like, oh, you're the liberals.
[02:01:52.568 --> 02:01:53.649]  Let me comply with you.
[02:01:53.649 --> 02:01:55.329]  It's like, don't say the N-word.
[02:01:55.329 --> 02:01:56.270]  Well, I never said that.
[02:01:56.270 --> 02:01:57.030]  I love black people.
[02:01:57.030 --> 02:01:57.930]  I love everybody.
[02:01:57.930 --> 02:01:58.450]  Good.
[02:01:58.450 --> 02:01:59.471]  Don't say mother and father.
[02:01:59.471 --> 02:02:00.491]  Well, why?
[02:02:00.491 --> 02:02:02.172]  Well, it hurts people's feelings.
[02:02:02.172 --> 02:02:03.712]  You may not have a mother and father.
[02:02:03.712 --> 02:02:04.573]  You see, it's always like,
[02:02:05.424 --> 02:02:08.187]  They get you to go, oh, you can't say that.
[02:02:08.187 --> 02:02:10.109]  And you're like, well, I don't like the KKK.
[02:02:10.109 --> 02:02:12.611]  OK, take their rights away.
[02:02:12.611 --> 02:02:14.093]  Now your rights are taken away.
[02:02:14.093 --> 02:02:16.876]  It's very elementary, my dear Watson.
[02:02:19.048 --> 02:02:20.529]  Ezra Revant is coming up.
[02:02:20.529 --> 02:02:21.269]  Very excited.
[02:02:21.269 --> 02:02:23.189]  I'm going to interview him for a segment.
[02:02:23.189 --> 02:02:25.070]  He's a great talk show host in his own right.
[02:02:25.070 --> 02:02:25.570]  The Rebel Media.
[02:02:25.570 --> 02:02:26.971]  He's going to take over two segments.
[02:02:26.971 --> 02:02:31.992]  And then we're going to have Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer hosting from D.C.
[02:02:31.992 --> 02:02:34.213]  Harrison's back in Austin, Texas.
[02:02:34.213 --> 02:02:42.236]  But let's go ahead and go back to that caller who was making a really, really important point about what's happening.
[02:02:42.236 --> 02:02:43.096]  Todd in Texas.
[02:02:43.096 --> 02:02:44.016]  Start over.
[02:02:44.016 --> 02:02:45.657]  Some stations don't carry that first five minutes.
[02:02:45.657 --> 02:02:45.957]  Start over.
[02:02:47.378 --> 02:03:16.637]  Okay, so what my point is is that, you know, why this is happening now is because it's kind of like all the chips are in, and people are starting to write articles such as Economist are on the run about Paul Krugman and the globalist economist that it hurt America, and now Paul Krugman is admitting he was wrong.
[02:03:17.373 --> 02:03:28.735]  And it's really absurd because he's saying that no one saw the pitfalls when we know that you've been doing it for the last 20 years, that we all, especially Ron Paul, was worrying about this.
[02:03:28.735 --> 02:03:38.597]  And now that it's kind of like in the Terminator when Skynet realizing it's losing and it has to drop the final nail.
[02:03:38.597 --> 02:03:45.999]  I was going to call in back in October and ask you, well, if they're admitting that globalism has failed, what's their next move?
[02:03:45.999 --> 02:03:46.939]  And I've realized
[02:03:47.621 --> 02:03:49.882]  This is it.
[02:03:49.882 --> 02:03:51.443]  There is nothing after.
[02:03:51.443 --> 02:03:53.043]  Let me say this, Todd.
[02:03:53.043 --> 02:03:55.324]  Never truer words have been spoken.
[02:03:55.324 --> 02:04:01.186]  The globalists admit they were a system that claimed egalitarianism, freedom, redistribution.
[02:04:01.186 --> 02:04:02.767]  They hoarded everything.
[02:04:02.767 --> 02:04:04.188]  They all made trillions of dollars.
[02:04:04.188 --> 02:04:05.328]  And then they go, oh, we're liberal.
[02:04:05.328 --> 02:04:06.569]  We love black men.
[02:04:06.569 --> 02:04:08.569]  Oh, a cop shot an innocent black guy.
[02:04:08.569 --> 02:04:12.251]  Oh, let's have a, you know, it's a total distraction while they run Chinese slave camps.
[02:04:13.524 --> 02:04:15.766]  For Christians, Buddhists and Muslims and others.
[02:04:15.766 --> 02:04:17.687]  So you're absolutely right.
[02:04:17.687 --> 02:04:36.440]  This is just unprecedented and this is their move to devastate the economy, to lock you in your house, to make you scared of a virus so you don't think about how they created all these derivatives and sold mortgages hundreds of times apiece and engaged in all this fraud and are involved in child kidnapping and child trafficking.
[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:39.641]  And Hollywood's collapsing.
[02:04:39.641 --> 02:04:41.321]  So they're collapsing.
[02:04:41.321 --> 02:04:45.922]  They want to hide their collapse by collapsing us, is what you're saying.
[02:04:45.922 --> 02:04:46.482]  That's it.
[02:04:46.482 --> 02:04:48.243]  And there's one other point I want to make.
[02:04:48.243 --> 02:05:00.905]  I saw a disgusting interview between Paul Krugman and Bill Moyers where they had a book and it was a bunch of statistics about inequality in America.
[02:05:00.905 --> 02:05:03.606]  And Paul Krugman, who, you know, is kind of the
[02:05:04.301 --> 02:05:08.604]  The architect of a lot of this, what we saw in American globalization.
[02:05:08.604 --> 02:05:11.986]  Oh yeah, Paul Krugman is an absolute demon.
[02:05:11.986 --> 02:05:20.511]  He is blaming the inequity that they created with their globalization on race.
[02:05:20.511 --> 02:05:22.292]  Oh yeah, listen, I'm going to let you go, Tom.
[02:05:22.292 --> 02:05:23.233]  You make great points.
[02:05:23.233 --> 02:05:27.736]  I remember like five years ago, the globalists were in the Financial Times and came out of WikiLeaks too.
[02:05:27.736 --> 02:05:29.096]  They said, we're in trouble.
[02:05:29.096 --> 02:05:30.217]  Everyone's on to us.
[02:05:30.217 --> 02:05:31.098]  Let's just have a race war.
[02:05:31.983 --> 02:05:35.024]  I mean, so that exactly, that's their rear guard action.
[02:05:35.024 --> 02:05:38.266]  That's their Scorched Earth policy.
[02:05:38.266 --> 02:05:40.407]  Let's go to Chase in California.
[02:05:40.407 --> 02:05:41.207]  Chase, thanks for holding.
[02:05:41.207 --> 02:05:42.788]  Go ahead.
[02:05:42.788 --> 02:05:44.468]  Alex, thanks for taking my call over there.
[02:05:44.468 --> 02:05:47.210]  Hey, everybody out there, you need to go support InfoWars.
[02:05:47.210 --> 02:05:53.432]  Go get you some emergency food supply to protect your family or go get you a hat or a shirt to spread the word.
[02:05:53.432 --> 02:05:55.473]  And here's the thing that you're going to get in there.
[02:05:55.473 --> 02:05:56.694]  You know, Alex, really cool.
[02:05:56.694 --> 02:05:59.655]  You send in a pocket constitution on every shipment.
[02:06:00.160 --> 02:06:05.962]  And right now is one of those times where that pocket constitution and that Declaration of Independence is very important.
[02:06:05.962 --> 02:06:09.944]  When you read that declaration, there's a long list of complaints.
[02:06:09.944 --> 02:06:12.605]  That was the main meat and potatoes of the declaration.
[02:06:12.605 --> 02:06:22.949]  And if you go to complaint number 13, it says, he has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution and acknowledged by our laws.
[02:06:23.536 --> 02:06:27.417]  Giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation.
[02:06:27.417 --> 02:06:31.139]  And that is exactly one of many that are being violated again today.
[02:06:31.139 --> 02:06:34.060]  But I want you guys... There's a little grain of good news, Alex.
[02:06:34.060 --> 02:06:39.902]  There's an article been going around by Reuters saying that 80% say that Biden won the White House.
[02:06:39.902 --> 02:06:43.003]  If you guys bring that article up, there's another little truth nugget in there.
[02:06:43.003 --> 02:06:44.783]  Something that gives me hope.
[02:06:44.783 --> 02:06:50.125]  It also says that 3% of Americans believe that President Trump won the election.
[02:06:51.515 --> 02:06:56.059]  3% of Americans are the original colonists that started the original revolution.
[02:06:56.059 --> 02:07:00.943]  So everyone out there, 3% can make a huge difference if you stand true.
[02:07:00.943 --> 02:07:03.325]  Patriots, you need to use this energy.
[02:07:03.325 --> 02:07:05.187]  You need to take action locally.
[02:07:05.187 --> 02:07:06.268]  Run for city council.
[02:07:06.727 --> 02:07:12.189]  Get on to Parler and start a national organization because they're actually allowing free speech.
[02:07:12.189 --> 02:07:19.252]  Local elections... I was about to say, though, the awakening I'm seeing now should shake the globalists to their very foundations.
[02:07:19.252 --> 02:07:20.792]  That's why they're going to launch everything they've got.
[02:07:20.792 --> 02:07:22.993]  They realize this is a desperate gamble.
[02:07:22.993 --> 02:07:23.553]  They're in trouble.
[02:07:23.553 --> 02:07:24.354]  But let me be clear with you, sir.
[02:07:25.735 --> 02:07:27.576]  3% did start the country and did win it.
[02:07:27.576 --> 02:07:28.797]  You're absolutely right.
[02:07:28.797 --> 02:07:32.039]  But man, let me tell you, Trump won on a landslide.
[02:07:32.039 --> 02:07:34.141]  Everyone I know believes Trump won.
[02:07:34.141 --> 02:07:36.462]  Black, white, Hispanic, old, young.
[02:07:36.462 --> 02:07:39.644]  I mean, it's like 60% support Trump.
[02:07:39.644 --> 02:07:41.886]  Everybody knew Trump was working his ass off.
[02:07:41.886 --> 02:07:48.250]  No one votes for that dead zombie Biden and Kamala that had half a percent support Democrats.
[02:07:48.250 --> 02:07:49.171]  Everyone hates them.
[02:07:49.171 --> 02:07:50.552]  That's why the globalists chose them.
[02:07:50.552 --> 02:07:53.754]  Because they're such weak puppets, they can control them.
[02:07:53.754 --> 02:07:54.494]  So I think we have 60%
[02:07:55.855 --> 02:07:59.737]  It's just we have to convince ourselves that we are the majority and start not complying.
[02:07:59.737 --> 02:08:01.738]  They think they've got civil disobedience?
[02:08:01.738 --> 02:08:04.019]  How about we all start going and shutting down Google buildings?
[02:08:04.019 --> 02:08:05.659]  How about we start shutting down Target?
[02:08:05.659 --> 02:08:08.981]  How about we start shutting down all their operations instead of saying kill the police?
[02:08:08.981 --> 02:08:17.945]  How about we peacefully go out and block them and go to the Democrat mayor's houses and the legislators and just live out in their yards and follow them around and never stop?
[02:08:17.945 --> 02:08:21.807]  How about they get real civil disobedience on their little bullying asses?
[02:08:21.807 --> 02:08:22.447]  I appreciate your call.
[02:08:23.780 --> 02:08:23.880]  As
[02:08:38.686 --> 02:08:43.668]  Concentration camps are announcing and where this is going is take on Trump and so much more.
[02:08:43.668 --> 02:08:52.933]  I'll interview him for one segment and then Ezra Levant is going to take over so I can go get ready with Owen Schroeder and others for operations here in DC tonight to expose what's happening with tomorrow high noon.
[02:08:52.933 --> 02:08:54.854]  What's the name of the park?
[02:08:54.854 --> 02:08:55.514]  It's right by uh...
[02:08:57.500 --> 02:08:58.521]  Freedom Plaza.
[02:08:58.521 --> 02:09:03.724]  And they can also go to Owen's parlor that he set up.
[02:09:03.724 --> 02:09:06.386]  Stop the Steel Caravan on Parlor.
[02:09:06.386 --> 02:09:11.550]  You can see all the updates, where we're going to be, what we're going to do.
[02:09:11.550 --> 02:09:17.054]  Owen and my son Rex Jones were out at the rally earlier at the White House and Trump tweeted out while they were there.
[02:09:17.054 --> 02:09:19.696]  We're going to be there again tonight.
[02:09:19.696 --> 02:09:20.857]  I'm going to go bullhorn the White House.
[02:09:21.818 --> 02:09:22.738]  Uh, and it has an effect.
[02:09:22.738 --> 02:09:23.919]  Every time I bulldoze, it's on the news.
[02:09:23.919 --> 02:09:24.639]  People pick it up.
[02:09:24.639 --> 02:09:25.480]  It's good.
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:26.080]  It's so simple.
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:26.780]  We're gonna be there.
[02:09:26.780 --> 02:09:28.041]  We're fighting hard.
[02:09:28.041 --> 02:09:30.702]  And Angie was telling Americans they better not show up.
[02:09:30.702 --> 02:09:32.983]  Screw you, you commies.
[02:09:32.983 --> 02:09:36.164]  Work for George Soros and the Chi-Coms.
[02:09:36.164 --> 02:09:37.404]  You claim you're the resistance.
[02:09:37.404 --> 02:09:39.425]  You work for the establishment.
[02:09:39.425 --> 02:09:40.806]  You are absolutely disgusting.
[02:09:42.202 --> 02:09:43.443]  And a joke.
[02:09:43.443 --> 02:09:46.425]  And the public sees right through everything you're doing.
[02:09:46.425 --> 02:09:47.005]  We'll be right back.
[02:09:47.005 --> 02:09:49.927]  Look, we all know that CNN is the epitome of fake news.
[02:09:49.927 --> 02:09:58.533]  But there's a headline on their site today that says, there are disinformation groups and organizations saying Joe Biden is not president-elect.
[02:09:59.738 --> 02:10:08.283]  Well, on its face, he's not president-elect because the votes have not been certified by any of the 50 states.
[02:10:08.283 --> 02:10:11.826]  And counting is still going on, what, in seven of the states?
[02:10:11.826 --> 02:10:15.148]  And Trump is gaining ground in all but one of them.
[02:10:15.967 --> 02:10:21.552]  And then there's also going to be recounts, audits, and all the spot checks have already shown massive fraud.
[02:10:21.552 --> 02:10:25.255]  But, in comes the ace card, the ace of spades.
[02:10:25.255 --> 02:10:35.444]  Big tech censorship is blocking not just the President, not just members of Congress, but tens of millions of Americans from even sharing local news stations confirming the fraud.
[02:10:35.444 --> 02:10:39.088]  This is a foreign-backed, multinational takeover of the United States.
[02:10:39.088 --> 02:10:41.029]  Trump is battling a Chinese-backed,
[02:10:47.093 --> 02:10:52.477]  When President Trump said that the mainstream corporate media was the enemy of America, he really was telling the truth.
[02:10:52.477 --> 02:10:58.720]  They don't just work for the Communist Chinese, and the globalists, and the EU, and the whole Hollywood, America-hating, God-hating crew.
[02:10:58.720 --> 02:11:07.326]  They literally say that they are in control of our minds, and believe that they do own us, and tell us who the President is, even though that's not in law.
[02:11:08.146 --> 02:11:16.434]  And they're just gaslighting the whole public over and over again saying, Joe Biden is president-elect, repeating it over and over again like a brainwashing mantra.
[02:11:16.434 --> 02:11:22.259]  When it's up again to the state government to certify those votes, and those votes are being challenged, there's massive evidence of fraud.
[02:11:22.259 --> 02:11:25.202]  Again, this is so incredibly clear.
[02:11:25.202 --> 02:11:31.568]  Biden said, because he thought he was going to lose up front, that, oh, we're going to challenge the vote no matter what, until every vote's counted.
[02:11:32.108 --> 02:11:35.172]  Well, a lot of votes haven't been counted and there's massive fraud being discovered.
[02:11:35.172 --> 02:11:39.256]  So we're going to hold the course here because Joe Biden is a communist Chinese agent.
[02:11:39.256 --> 02:11:39.937]  He's a globalist.
[02:11:39.937 --> 02:11:41.118]  He wants carbon taxes.
[02:11:41.118 --> 02:11:45.383]  He will destroy this country by design to consolidate power and take control of us.
[02:11:45.383 --> 02:11:50.609]  This is war.
[02:11:50.609 --> 02:11:53.232]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:06.269 --> 02:12:14.294]  All right, Ezra Levant, an amazing patriot up in Canada, was scheduled to be on this this hour, and I appreciate him coming on late because we got behind.
[02:12:14.294 --> 02:12:15.434]  We've got more breaking news.
[02:12:15.434 --> 02:12:22.539]  I'm going to interview him for a minute and then hand the baton over to him, but it's being coming on the Washington Examiner in just the news.
[02:12:22.539 --> 02:12:23.619]  Never bet against me.
[02:12:23.619 --> 02:12:27.722]  Trump makes first post-election comments, lays out path to victory.
[02:12:27.722 --> 02:12:30.763]  There's probably two weeks to three weeks to no.
[02:12:32.113 --> 02:12:41.096]  That's what President Trump told the Washington Examiner Report Brian York today in his first post-election comments on the state of the 2020 presidential election.
[02:12:41.096 --> 02:12:49.898]  Trump was optimistic, laying out a scenario in which he pulls out a key in battleground states and gets to the magic 270 votes in the Electoral College.
[02:12:49.898 --> 02:12:51.679]  We're going to win Wisconsin, the President said.
[02:12:52.847 --> 02:12:54.288]  We just lost a phone interview.
[02:12:54.288 --> 02:12:55.989]  Arizona, it's down to 8,000 votes.
[02:12:55.989 --> 02:12:57.751]  Yeah, he keeps trying to win.
[02:12:57.751 --> 02:13:02.814]  And if we can't do an audit of the millions of votes, we'll find 8,000 votes easily.
[02:13:02.814 --> 02:13:05.116]  If we can do an audit, we will be in good shape.
[02:13:05.116 --> 02:13:06.537]  Georgia, we're going to win.
[02:13:06.537 --> 02:13:09.599]  Because now we're going down to about 10,000, 11,000 votes.
[02:13:09.599 --> 02:13:14.443]  And we are hand counting, he said, referring to a call by Georgia's Secretary of State to perform a hand count.
[02:13:14.443 --> 02:13:16.064]  Hand counting is the best.
[02:13:16.064 --> 02:13:18.706]  To do a spin of the machine doesn't mean anything.
[02:13:19.724 --> 02:13:22.985]  You pick up 10 votes, then you hand count.
[02:13:22.985 --> 02:13:24.986]  I think we're going to win Georgia.
[02:13:24.986 --> 02:13:27.127]  And he goes on to lay out Pennsylvania.
[02:13:27.127 --> 02:13:34.929]  Trump also is in a rosy view of North Carolina, where he leads by more than 70,000 votes, but they won't call it because they don't want him to have a win.
[02:13:34.929 --> 02:13:39.111]  He predicts a win there unless, he said jokingly, they happen to find lots of votes like before.
[02:13:39.724 --> 02:13:42.506]  When are we going to put in these new North Carolina?
[02:13:42.506 --> 02:13:45.127]  When are they going to find a bunch from Charlotte?
[02:13:45.127 --> 02:13:46.168]  He goes into Pennsylvania.
[02:13:46.168 --> 02:13:47.528]  He goes into it all.
[02:13:47.528 --> 02:13:49.229]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[02:13:49.229 --> 02:13:51.050]  Ezra Levant from Rebel Media.
[02:13:51.050 --> 02:13:52.431]  Thank you for joining us.
[02:13:52.431 --> 02:13:56.233]  Let's talk a few minutes about the big picture, about lockdown too, about Trump.
[02:13:56.233 --> 02:13:57.154]  You're a smart cookie.
[02:13:57.154 --> 02:13:58.695]  What is your gut telling you?
[02:13:58.695 --> 02:14:00.616]  What is that noodle telling you, Ezra?
[02:14:01.926 --> 02:14:08.949]  Well, I think they're trying to condition Americans and the world to accept the fait accompli.
[02:14:08.949 --> 02:14:10.710]  That's why they're delaying these counts.
[02:14:10.710 --> 02:14:17.954]  That's why every, you know, when Biden himself stands in front of a made up thing, the office of the president-elect, that's not a thing.
[02:14:18.780 --> 02:14:22.423]  I mean, you may as well say I'm the king of the moon.
[02:14:22.423 --> 02:14:29.068]  Just because you put it in authoritative text on a banner behind you doesn't make it true.
[02:14:29.068 --> 02:14:33.391]  That was fake news and that image was not censored on Twitter or anywhere.
[02:14:33.391 --> 02:14:42.838]  And you'll notice the first people around the world to call Biden to congratulate him were all the anti-American world leaders, Justin Trudeau of Canada,
[02:14:43.616 --> 02:14:48.580]  Boasted about being the first, because they want to cement it.
[02:14:48.580 --> 02:14:50.301]  They want to project it.
[02:14:50.301 --> 02:14:53.584]  They want anyone to give up hope that it would be otherwise.
[02:14:53.584 --> 02:14:57.547]  And they want to curry favor with Biden if he actually does pull it off.
[02:14:57.547 --> 02:14:59.828]  They want to disparage Trump in any way.
[02:14:59.828 --> 02:15:04.852]  You'll notice that the savvier leaders, like the President of Mexico, the President of Russia, say, you know what?
[02:15:04.852 --> 02:15:06.773]  We'll actually wait till the thing's counted.
[02:15:06.773 --> 02:15:12.798]  But all your America haters who like a weak America... By the way, countries who are against Trump
[02:15:13.772 --> 02:15:26.276]  They're not against Trump so much personally as that Trump makes America stronger, demands from NATO allies that they spend more, demands from other countries that the trade deals are fair.
[02:15:26.276 --> 02:15:40.840]  So when you have a foreign leader cheering a Biden America, they're actually cheering for a pushover America, whether it's Iran or Venezuela or countries like that or China, which has been exhilarated these last two weeks.
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:42.742]  That's what's going on.
[02:15:42.742 --> 02:15:48.048]  And the only question is, will 72 million Americans buy the lie?
[02:15:48.048 --> 02:15:48.970]  Well, that's right, Ezra.
[02:15:48.970 --> 02:15:52.734]  Communist China saw their internal currency go up to all-time highs.
[02:15:52.734 --> 02:15:56.899]  They're celebrating, bragging, quote, Biden is in sync with us, we own him.
[02:15:56.899 --> 02:15:58.722]  I mean, they are just celebrating this.
[02:15:59.912 --> 02:16:07.216]  Well, and it's absolutely official state-run media from China, the People's Daily, Global Times.
[02:16:07.216 --> 02:16:12.479]  These are mouthpieces in English for propaganda to the outside world.
[02:16:12.479 --> 02:16:13.239]  So these aren't just...
[02:16:13.777 --> 02:16:36.791]  Independent pundits there is no such thing as an independent pundit in Chinese media there So when you see the mockery of Trump and the cheering of Biden that is that country's dictatorship saying Thankfully the trade battles over the skepticism of Huawei is over you know the pushing back against
[02:16:37.441 --> 02:16:39.622]  Chinese military expansionism.
[02:16:39.622 --> 02:16:48.845]  So what's happening is you see, and Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro himself tweeted how excited he was to have a dialogue with Biden and Harris.
[02:16:48.845 --> 02:16:57.749]  These people are telling you that if Biden actually pulls the thing off, and let's be candid Alex, there's a real chance of that.
[02:16:57.749 --> 02:17:02.931]  I'm just saying that those who are assuming it's a fait accompli, they're trying to undermine America.
[02:17:04.226 --> 02:17:05.567]  I mean, I totally agree.
[02:17:05.567 --> 02:17:07.067]  Clearly, there's a lot of election fraud.
[02:17:07.067 --> 02:17:08.208]  Clearly, they brought in votes later.
[02:17:08.208 --> 02:17:09.548]  It looks like they stole it.
[02:17:09.548 --> 02:17:15.091]  But if he's a Chinese agent, Biden, his son, we heard this whole time, if you're compromised, you get me president.
[02:17:15.091 --> 02:17:27.577]  Well, Russiagate was made up, but Chinagate, wow, are they really going to put this doddering, crazy, compromised puppet that brags that he got, you know, a billion bucks in Ukraine to drop investigations on his son?
[02:17:27.577 --> 02:17:30.138]  I mean, this just smells like a nightmare to me.
[02:17:31.383 --> 02:17:32.504]  Yeah, and that's the thing.
[02:17:32.504 --> 02:17:41.269]  If you look at Biden and, I mean, they give him a big injection in the tush of, I don't know, adrenaline and vitamin B, and he's good for half an hour, an hour.
[02:17:41.269 --> 02:17:45.932]  He actually managed not to stumble over himself too badly in the debates.
[02:17:45.932 --> 02:17:49.154]  But I don't believe he's going to be the de facto president.
[02:17:49.154 --> 02:17:51.576]  I think he's going to be more like a mascot.
[02:17:51.576 --> 02:17:53.077]  Trot him out there.
[02:17:53.077 --> 02:18:00.762]  And what's curious to me, and you're starting to see it as he puts together his transition team so confidently that he's going to win these recounts.
[02:18:01.679 --> 02:18:04.261]  Those are the people I think we have to scrutinize.
[02:18:04.261 --> 02:18:09.945]  I truly don't, I mean, yes, you're going to have the Chinese connection and Hunter Biden can't believe his luck.
[02:18:09.945 --> 02:18:12.446]  He's going to be a billionaire out of this.
[02:18:12.446 --> 02:18:15.668]  But who will actually be making the decision?
[02:18:15.668 --> 02:18:20.331]  The chiefs of staff, the chiefs of staff for the different cabinet ministers.
[02:18:20.331 --> 02:18:21.352]  Who's in control?
[02:18:21.352 --> 02:18:25.855]  Is it the Ilhan Omar AOC wing of the party?
[02:18:25.855 --> 02:18:30.298]  That, I mean, what Joe Biden says and does, I mean, half the time he doesn't even know where he is.
[02:18:30.982 --> 02:18:35.245]  He is the facade, like in the Wizard of Oz.
[02:18:35.245 --> 02:18:39.468]  I want to see who's behind the scene.
[02:18:39.468 --> 02:18:40.489]  I totally agree with you.
[02:18:40.489 --> 02:18:42.330]  He's the curtain.
[02:18:42.330 --> 02:18:48.715]  And behind the scenes is Obama, is Hillary, is the Muslim Brotherhood, is the Chi-Coms, is the Russians.
[02:18:48.715 --> 02:18:50.536]  I mean, this is just open for business.
[02:18:50.536 --> 02:18:53.078]  I mean, this is incredible.
[02:18:53.078 --> 02:18:57.101]  It's like Biden will be the pimp, and then we are the person that gets raped here.
[02:18:58.652 --> 02:19:07.917]  Well, the last count I saw is that more than 40 registered lobbyists have already joined the transition team with Trump.
[02:19:07.917 --> 02:19:16.662]  One of the reasons the deep state hated him was not so much that they disagreed with him, but they didn't know how to connect with him, how to schmooze him, how to bend his arm.
[02:19:16.662 --> 02:19:18.003]  He didn't have access points.
[02:19:18.323 --> 02:19:18.523]  We're good.
[02:19:39.697 --> 02:19:43.819]  With other swamp creatures before him and perhaps after him.
[02:19:43.819 --> 02:19:45.339]  So... Exactly!
[02:19:45.339 --> 02:19:59.444]  He was an island unto himself who really believed in America, was fair and pragmatic, believed in other countries' sovereignty, and that the bureaucracy didn't like the fact that they didn't have a president that they would come to with committees and have him agree to their policy, making them the president.
[02:19:59.444 --> 02:20:01.065]  They were pissed that there's actually a real president.
[02:20:02.196 --> 02:20:02.876]  Yeah.
[02:20:02.876 --> 02:20:07.399]  You know, I mean, log rolling is a word, and you can use it positively or negatively.
[02:20:07.399 --> 02:20:10.981]  It's basically, you do me a favor, I do you a favor.
[02:20:10.981 --> 02:20:13.143]  Trump doesn't really work that way.
[02:20:13.143 --> 02:20:26.651]  And I think Washington is excited, not just the Democrats, but all of Washington, every public sector bureaucrat, every government union, they're saying, oh good, that irritant is gone, let's go back to this
[02:20:27.131 --> 02:20:31.514]  You know, irreplaceable deep state that never comes and goes.
[02:20:31.514 --> 02:20:37.078]  I think it's sad, and I'm a Canadian, and I'm worried about the effect on our country, because as America goes... Absolutely.
[02:20:37.078 --> 02:20:38.759]  Errol Roman is the founder of Rebel Media.
[02:20:38.759 --> 02:20:39.600]  I'll tell you all about it.
[02:20:39.600 --> 02:20:41.041]  I'm going to introduce him next segment.
[02:20:41.041 --> 02:20:41.701]  He takes over.
[02:20:41.701 --> 02:20:45.263]  They've also got draconian lockdowns around the world, and Canada's the epicenter.
[02:20:45.263 --> 02:20:46.024]  Coming here next.
[02:20:46.024 --> 02:20:47.145]  Wait till you hear about that.
[02:20:47.785 --> 02:20:52.968]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when it comes to the show?
[02:20:52.968 --> 02:21:10.537]  And it's the fact that InfoWars, more than 25 years ago, doing basic research with what the Club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying, developed the hypothesis that Communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[02:21:10.537 --> 02:21:11.817]  Well, now China owns the debt.
[02:21:11.817 --> 02:21:14.579]  Now China owns Hollywood, all the one-sided trading deals.
[02:21:15.299 --> 02:21:19.942]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on, but again, it wasn't that hard.
[02:21:19.942 --> 02:21:25.586]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still, others didn't want to focus on that issue.
[02:21:25.586 --> 02:21:30.089]  We did, and you focused on it by supporting us at InfoWars.
[02:21:30.089 --> 02:21:41.156]  So when you go to InfoWarsStore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts, films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world of what's really happening.
[02:21:41.156 --> 02:21:42.957]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[02:21:42.957 --> 02:21:43.978]  I want to thank you for your support.
[02:21:47.139 --> 02:21:49.621]  America is in crisis.
[02:21:49.621 --> 02:21:54.466]  Emergency Lockdown 2 is coming under Biden.
[02:21:54.466 --> 02:22:01.072]  Support InfoWars, the fight against total economic collapse, and Biden's martial law disguised as Lockdown 2.

[02:22:18.529 --> 02:22:22.813]  These are game-changing things that the globalists don't need to have.
[02:22:22.813 --> 02:22:27.858]  These are things that are absolutely elemental to what you and your body have to have to live.
[02:22:27.858 --> 02:22:32.223]  But regardless, buying these products from us funds the Info Wars, so it's a 360 win.
[02:22:32.443 --> 02:22:33.704]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:22:33.704 --> 02:22:35.626]  I want to ask you to redouble your efforts to spread the word.
[02:22:35.626 --> 02:22:37.308]  I want to ask you to buy the products.

[02:22:40.311 --> 02:22:41.772]  Again, I salute you and thank you all.
[02:22:41.772 --> 02:22:44.855]  The toll-free number is 888-253-3139.
[02:22:44.855 --> 02:22:47.297]  Please take action today in our emergency center.
[02:22:47.297 --> 02:22:50.320]  Election 2020 is here, and whether Trump wins or loses,
[02:22:51.241 --> 02:23:02.425]  We have all won by exposing the communist Chinese, by exposing the globalists, by exposing the pedophile rings, by exposing the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil.
[02:23:02.425 --> 02:23:06.986]  Now I'm personally a Christian and I believe in God and I know God's real and I've experienced it in my life.
[02:23:06.986 --> 02:23:12.268]  But even if you don't believe in God, it's important to recognize that there is good in this world, there is evil.
[02:23:12.268 --> 02:23:15.509]  And there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing bad.
[02:23:16.469 --> 02:23:26.333]  And what I see happening across the spectrum of different political views is people finally get that, they finally understand that they're not being naive anymore.
[02:23:26.333 --> 02:23:32.995]  Don't ever project your decency and your goodness onto other people until they've proven what they stand for.
[02:23:32.995 --> 02:23:34.436]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:24:06.823 --> 02:24:08.304]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:24:08.304 --> 02:24:10.847]  I'm handing the baton over to Ezra LeVant of Rebel Media.
[02:24:10.847 --> 02:24:14.950]  He's got the new best-selling book, The China Virus, banned twice by Amazon.
[02:24:14.950 --> 02:24:16.051]  And it is the China virus.
[02:24:16.051 --> 02:24:17.132]  It is the globalist virus.
[02:24:17.132 --> 02:24:18.253]  It is the Wuhan virus.
[02:24:18.253 --> 02:24:19.734]  It is the Fauci virus.
[02:24:19.734 --> 02:24:20.735]  It is the Bill Gates virus.
[02:24:20.735 --> 02:24:22.177]  And I just hope none of this is said.
[02:24:23.217 --> 02:24:24.478]  I mean, I was on Tim Poole's show.
[02:24:24.478 --> 02:24:26.479]  Big show, big podcast last night.
[02:24:26.479 --> 02:24:33.524]  I'm like, hey, you know, it's in Newsweek, it's in the New York Post, it's in BBC, Wuhan, and The Lab, and Gates, and Fauci.
[02:24:33.524 --> 02:24:34.705]  You know, that's crazy.
[02:24:34.705 --> 02:24:35.806]  They pull it up, it's there.
[02:24:35.806 --> 02:24:37.988]  They don't even know that stuff.
[02:24:37.988 --> 02:24:39.689]  And Tim Poole's a smart guy.
[02:24:39.689 --> 02:24:42.671]  So it's crazy times to be alive right now.
[02:24:42.671 --> 02:24:45.173]  Ezra, you've got the floor of the next two segments.
[02:24:45.173 --> 02:24:46.254]  And I really appreciate it.
[02:24:46.254 --> 02:24:47.675]  I'll see everybody at the march tomorrow.
[02:24:47.675 --> 02:24:48.775]  We've got the war room coming up.
[02:24:48.775 --> 02:24:50.136]  I'll be back on that.
[02:24:50.136 --> 02:24:51.417]  But Ezra, we really appreciate you.
[02:24:51.417 --> 02:24:51.998]  Brother, take over.
[02:24:53.311 --> 02:24:54.331]  My pleasure.
[02:24:54.331 --> 02:24:55.372]  Great to be in the chair.
[02:24:55.372 --> 02:24:58.913]  Thanks for the trust that your invitation shows for me.
[02:24:58.913 --> 02:25:02.194]  Hello to Alex's viewers around the world.
[02:25:02.194 --> 02:25:10.577]  I'm based here in Canada with rebelnews.com, but we deeply believe in freedom and we believe in the success of the United States.
[02:25:10.577 --> 02:25:18.180]  Although we're proud Canadians, we understand that America is the bulwark of liberty against so many forces of tyranny, including from China.
[02:25:18.180 --> 02:25:22.442]  And if I may, Alex, just a moment ago mentioned my book, China Virus.
[02:25:24.467 --> 02:25:26.248]  That book was not controversial.
[02:25:26.248 --> 02:25:28.970]  There's a ton of footnotes in it.
[02:25:28.970 --> 02:25:33.233]  Really, everything there was confirmed by legacy media, mainstream media.
[02:25:33.233 --> 02:25:36.235]  There were no speculative theories in it.
[02:25:36.235 --> 02:25:46.582]  But because it contradicted, quote, official sources, it was banned by Amazon.com, which is the number one bookstore in the world.
[02:25:46.582 --> 02:25:48.643]  So I wrote the book.
[02:25:48.643 --> 02:25:52.946]  We went to upload it as we've uploaded our previous 14 books we published.
[02:25:53.655 --> 02:25:59.237]  It was rejected for two months, they fought us, claiming it contradicted official narratives.
[02:25:59.237 --> 02:26:02.359]  That was the language they used, official sources.
[02:26:02.359 --> 02:26:04.300]  We tried to inquire with lawyers.
[02:26:04.300 --> 02:26:05.660]  Are those Canadian sources?
[02:26:05.660 --> 02:26:08.261]  Are those World Health Organization sources?
[02:26:08.261 --> 02:26:09.922]  Maybe those are Chinese sources.
[02:26:09.922 --> 02:26:12.543]  What do you mean by an official source?
[02:26:12.543 --> 02:26:13.964]  Then, one day, they relented.
[02:26:13.964 --> 02:26:15.124]  They didn't even explain why.
[02:26:15.124 --> 02:26:16.725]  They uploaded the book to Amazon.
[02:26:16.725 --> 02:26:18.506]  It went to number one in Canada.
[02:26:20.276 --> 02:26:21.796]  And within a week, they banned it again.
[02:26:21.796 --> 02:26:25.077]  They took it down and gave the same explanation again.
[02:26:25.077 --> 02:26:27.278]  It contradicted official sources.
[02:26:27.278 --> 02:26:31.439]  It was down for a week, they banned it, and then they unbanned it again.
[02:26:31.439 --> 02:26:32.759]  As of this moment, it's unbanned.
[02:26:32.759 --> 02:26:34.660]  But this goes to so many issues.
[02:26:34.660 --> 02:26:36.460]  It goes to censorship.
[02:26:36.460 --> 02:26:41.461]  It goes to the tech oligarchs that have so much control over our lives.
[02:26:41.461 --> 02:26:43.682]  It goes to the fact that you're not even allowed to criticize
[02:26:44.361 --> 02:26:45.181]  Official sources.
[02:26:45.181 --> 02:26:50.183]  We don't dispute that we criticize official sources that our point of view may be alternative or dissident.
[02:26:50.183 --> 02:26:52.304]  That's the whole point.
[02:26:52.304 --> 02:26:58.766]  Now, Alex invited me to talk about some issues regarding pandemic lockdowns in Canada and the world.
[02:26:58.766 --> 02:27:07.469]  And I want to show you a clip from Canada's chief public health officer, our version of Dr. Fauci.
[02:27:07.469 --> 02:27:11.550]  Her name is Teresa Tam, and she actually served
[02:27:12.458 --> 02:27:20.419]  On the World Health Organization at the same time as working as Canada's, as Justin Trudeau's Chief Public Health Officer.
[02:27:20.419 --> 02:27:21.680]  So which is it?
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:29.421]  How can you serve two masters, work for the UN's World Health Organization controlled by China and at the same time work for Justin Trudeau?
[02:27:29.421 --> 02:27:30.901]  What if there's a contradiction?
[02:27:30.901 --> 02:27:33.382]  What if there's a difference of opinion?
[02:27:33.382 --> 02:27:36.222]  Well, I'll show you what Theresa Tam stands for.
[02:27:36.222 --> 02:27:40.303]  This is a clip from a Canadian National Film Board documentary
[02:27:41.164 --> 02:27:45.146]  Where Theresa Tam wasn't yet the Chief Public Health Officer of the country.
[02:27:45.146 --> 02:27:55.412]  Listen to her talk prospectively about what she would do if she ever had the chance to people who refuse to comply with government orders.
[02:27:55.412 --> 02:27:57.234]  To take a government vaccine.
[02:27:57.234 --> 02:27:58.995]  To be locked down.
[02:27:58.995 --> 02:27:59.795]  Take a look at this.
[02:27:59.795 --> 02:28:02.417]  This woman is named Theresa Tam.
[02:28:02.417 --> 02:28:04.498]  She is Canada's Chief Public Health Officer.
[02:28:05.959 --> 02:28:15.585]  I think the public has to know this is one of the worst case scenarios in terms of an infectious disease outbreak, in that their cooperation is sought.
[02:28:15.585 --> 02:28:26.492]  If there are people who are non-compliant, there are definitely laws and public health powers that can quarantine people in mandatory settings.
[02:28:28.194 --> 02:28:28.974]  It's potential.
[02:28:28.974 --> 02:28:45.783]  You could track people, put bracelets on their arms, have police and other setups to ensure quarantine is undertaken.
[02:28:45.783 --> 02:28:52.886]  It is better to be preemptive and precautionary and take the heat of people thinking you might be overreactionary
[02:28:53.547 --> 02:28:59.312]  Get ahead of the curve and then think about whether you've overreacted later.
[02:28:59.312 --> 02:29:10.440]  But it's such a serious situation that I think decisive early action is the key.
[02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:17.486]  Police checkpoints are set up on all the bridges and everyone leaving the city is required to show proof of vaccination.
[02:29:17.486 --> 02:29:21.949]  Those who refuse to cooperate are taken away to temporary detention centers.
[02:29:26.377 --> 02:29:31.521]  It's almost like that was a plan as opposed to a hypothesis.
[02:29:31.521 --> 02:29:39.886]  That was a documentary where Theresa Tam sort of brainstormed what would happen if a pandemic broke out in the Canadian city of Montreal.
[02:29:39.886 --> 02:29:44.489]  And alas, now she's in the position to actually action those items.
[02:29:44.489 --> 02:29:48.812]  I know that InfoWars played this video earlier.
[02:29:48.812 --> 02:29:56.057]  It's a Canadian provincial politician in our great province of Ontario asking about planned
[02:29:57.630 --> 02:29:59.851]  Take a quick look.
[02:29:59.851 --> 02:30:08.535]  We're not going to play the whole thing, but here's Randy Hillier asking a question and he got no answer about plans for quarantine facilities across Canada.
[02:30:08.535 --> 02:30:11.276]  Take a look.
[02:30:11.276 --> 02:30:12.776]  Thank you, Speaker.
[02:30:12.776 --> 02:30:14.697]  My question is to the Premier.
[02:30:14.697 --> 02:30:21.100]  In my supplemental question yesterday, I asked this government if the people of Ontario should prepare for internment camps.
[02:30:22.043 --> 02:30:36.354]  In September, the federal government posted a call for expressions of interest for contractors to supply, provide, and manage quarantine isolation camps throughout every province and every territory in Kenda.
[02:30:36.354 --> 02:30:48.924]  These quarantine isolation camps, however, are not limited to people with COVID, but provide a wide latitude for many people to be detained.
[02:30:49.955 --> 02:30:56.543]  Surely this government is aware of the intentions to build these isolation camps from coast to coast.
[02:30:56.543 --> 02:31:01.108]  And my question to the Premier is, how many of these camps will be built?
[02:31:01.108 --> 02:31:04.032]  And how many people does this government expect to... Question!
[02:31:06.957 --> 02:31:09.578]  Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
[02:31:09.578 --> 02:31:20.823]  It is very true that when people leave the country and when they come back in, that the province is suggesting, and in the federal government, in cooperation with the federal government, we are suggesting that people isolate themselves.
[02:31:20.823 --> 02:31:26.725]  That has been a practice that has been very successful, not only here in the province of Ontario, but across Canada.
[02:31:26.725 --> 02:31:30.867]  And we will, of course, be redoubling our efforts to make sure that the people of the province of Ontario
[02:31:31.667 --> 02:31:33.829]  Remain safe, Mr. Speaker.
[02:31:33.829 --> 02:31:49.578]  So if the Member is referring to the fact that one of the public health policies is that when you return from a jurisdiction outside of the province of Ontario, or from another country, that you isolate yourself for two weeks, I would suggest that that has been a good policy that has been working.
[02:31:49.578 --> 02:31:52.640]  In fact, this House has been doing the same thing since we came back.
[02:31:52.640 --> 02:31:56.802]  We are working in cohorts to make sure that the Legislative Assembly can continue to operate.
[02:31:56.802 --> 02:31:58.463]  That's why we have two separate cohorts.
[02:31:59.111 --> 02:32:05.633]  The answer was about coming in from foreign countries and there's a quarantine, but let me show you the actual document.
[02:32:05.633 --> 02:32:11.655]  This is called a request for information put out by Canada's Public Works Agency.
[02:32:11.655 --> 02:32:27.780]  So this is a document published by the Trudeau government of Canada asking private contractors, so if you run a hotel, if you're a private prison contractor, anyone in the private sector, this was a document put up on the official government website calling
[02:32:28.681 --> 02:32:33.222]  For not bids at this phase, but for ideas, brainstorming.
[02:32:33.222 --> 02:32:35.643]  They called it a request for information.
[02:32:35.643 --> 02:32:41.785]  And let me read a little bit from paragraph C, where they talk about background, if you can see that there.
[02:32:41.785 --> 02:32:47.267]  I just want to read one sentence from about two-thirds of the way down.
[02:32:47.267 --> 02:32:54.709]  The sentence says, over time, the use of the designated quarantine sites, DQS,
[02:32:55.692 --> 02:33:05.756]  May be temporarily discontinued until needed again by the Government of Canada or may be used for other requirements.
[02:33:05.756 --> 02:33:14.980]  So these could be just for people who are coming in from a foreign country and have to quarantine for a couple weeks or they could be used for other requirements.
[02:33:14.980 --> 02:33:19.182]  Let me read just one more sentence before we go to a break.
[02:33:19.182 --> 02:33:23.984]  In anticipation of a possible continued need for quarantine sites over the next
[02:33:25.070 --> 02:33:28.271]  One to two years.
[02:33:28.271 --> 02:33:32.433]  So these quarantine sites aren't temporary.
[02:33:32.433 --> 02:33:36.795]  They could be here for years to come.
[02:33:36.795 --> 02:33:42.997]  We have to take a short break now, but when we come back, I want to show you how this public health mandate
[02:33:43.837 --> 02:33:52.723]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made, Alpha Power.

[02:34:37.284 --> 02:34:39.785]  Head to InfoWarsStore.com today.
[02:34:45.777 --> 02:34:46.959]  Remember Hillary Clinton?
[02:34:46.959 --> 02:34:47.900]  Remember Pelosi?
[02:34:47.900 --> 02:34:48.862]  Remember Bill Clinton?
[02:34:48.862 --> 02:34:50.264]  Remember Obama?
[02:34:50.264 --> 02:34:54.550]  All of them said, we are not going to concede if there's a red mirage.
[02:34:54.550 --> 02:34:58.976]  We believe it's going to look like Trump's going to win a landslide if they have the internal polls.
[02:34:58.976 --> 02:35:00.198]  And indeed, Trump won.
[02:35:00.939 --> 02:35:03.801]  Most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin.
[02:35:03.801 --> 02:35:10.326]  And when he was set to win the other ones, they froze the seven states on election night.
[02:35:10.326 --> 02:35:12.888]  And then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had.
[02:35:12.888 --> 02:35:13.829]  This is completely transparent.
[02:35:13.829 --> 02:35:16.911]  So when they say that he is president-elect, he's not.
[02:35:16.911 --> 02:35:17.812]  Trump has not conceded.
[02:35:17.812 --> 02:35:19.913]  None of the states have certified the vote.
[02:35:19.913 --> 02:35:22.115]  And now all these investigations have been opened up.
[02:35:22.115 --> 02:35:27.739]  And avalanches, mountains, oceans of election fraud has come out and already been documented.
[02:35:27.739 --> 02:35:28.340]  And in Georgia,
[02:35:29.040 --> 02:35:31.543]  Officials are on record saying we've already found fraud.
[02:35:31.543 --> 02:35:33.825]  So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in.
[02:35:33.825 --> 02:35:37.770]  They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time, because the last hoax failed.
[02:35:37.770 --> 02:35:41.894]  But now, this is the mother of all hoaxes, and if they get away with this, it's the end of America.
[02:35:41.894 --> 02:35:44.076]  As we know it, we will beat Venezuela.
[02:35:44.076 --> 02:35:44.837]  Infowars.com
[02:35:47.168 --> 02:35:51.432]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed.
[02:35:51.432 --> 02:35:52.613]  And why is that?
[02:35:52.613 --> 02:36:00.419]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree-like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds.
[02:36:00.419 --> 02:36:04.923]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[02:36:04.923 --> 02:36:06.204]  They didn't know why.
[02:36:06.204 --> 02:36:11.969]  Well, with modern science we know it's one of the purest, cleanest organic forms of selenium.

[02:36:38.763 --> 02:36:40.148]  You absolutely have to have.

[02:36:46.829 --> 02:36:51.371]  Introducing InfoWars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[02:36:51.371 --> 02:36:53.912]  This is taken under the tongue.
[02:36:53.912 --> 02:36:56.113]  It is pure turmeric.
[02:36:56.113 --> 02:37:05.317]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[02:37:05.317 --> 02:37:11.159]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[02:37:11.159 --> 02:37:13.320]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[02:37:13.760 --> 02:37:17.003]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[02:37:17.003 --> 02:37:18.845]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[02:37:18.845 --> 02:37:20.966]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[02:37:20.966 --> 02:37:23.148]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[02:37:23.148 --> 02:37:24.509]  Some like bodies better.
[02:37:24.509 --> 02:37:27.652]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action.
[02:37:27.652 --> 02:37:28.653]  It's so much more.
[02:37:28.653 --> 02:37:29.834]  And they fund the InfoWars.

[02:37:38.942 --> 02:37:43.708]  Turmeric is renowned for what it does for all of our bodies, for inflammation and so much more.
[02:37:43.708 --> 02:37:50.036]  Get yours today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[02:37:50.036 --> 02:37:52.659]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:38:06.940 --> 02:38:10.843]  Well, it's Ezra Levant here, up in the frozen north.
[02:38:10.843 --> 02:38:14.846]  It's not actually that frozen, I'm here in Toronto, Canada.
[02:38:14.846 --> 02:38:20.430]  Canada, America's greatest ally, but unfortunately, it's a place that doesn't have all of America's freedoms.
[02:38:20.430 --> 02:38:28.997]  I showed you before the break some of the internment camp dreams of our Chief Public Health Officer.
[02:38:28.997 --> 02:38:31.899]  I don't think you ever had Anthony Fauci talk in that crazy way.
[02:38:33.233 --> 02:38:36.075]  Arresting people, detaining them, until they get a jab.
[02:38:36.075 --> 02:38:38.797]  That's Canada's Public Health Officer, Theresa Tam.
[02:38:38.797 --> 02:38:53.169]  I also showed you a request for information from the Public Works Department of Canada, looking for private companies, prison companies, hotel companies, who knows, to give the government information.
[02:38:53.169 --> 02:38:56.312]  It wasn't a request for a proposal, it was a request for information.
[02:38:56.312 --> 02:38:56.692]  They wanted
[02:38:57.344 --> 02:39:03.688]  Big ideas from the private sector for building and running these quarantine facilities.
[02:39:03.688 --> 02:39:12.113]  They were described as a place for quarantining travelers, but for other purposes too.
[02:39:12.113 --> 02:39:17.917]  Used for other requirements and most ominously, this would continue for one or two years.
[02:39:20.879 --> 02:39:22.240]  Well, we're based here in Canada.
[02:39:22.240 --> 02:39:23.980]  We have a lot of American viewers.
[02:39:23.980 --> 02:39:28.402]  But we also have a very powerful journalist in Australia.
[02:39:28.402 --> 02:39:29.063]  Maybe you've heard of him.
[02:39:29.063 --> 02:39:31.104]  His name is Avi Yamini.
[02:39:31.104 --> 02:39:33.104]  And he's done outstanding journalism there.
[02:39:33.104 --> 02:39:34.765]  I'll get to Avi in a moment.
[02:39:34.765 --> 02:39:41.588]  But first I want to show you, if you think things are bad in America, and I tell you they're worse in many ways in Canada and Europe.
[02:39:41.588 --> 02:39:43.389]  The UK's gone nuts.
[02:39:43.389 --> 02:39:46.611]  But let me show you a minister in the Australian government.
[02:39:46.611 --> 02:39:48.832]  This was in August, I believe.
[02:39:48.832 --> 02:39:49.672]  Talking about
[02:39:51.531 --> 02:39:58.916]  What they would do if they got a vaccine, and they were talking about a made-in-China vaccine hastily rushed to market.
[02:39:58.916 --> 02:40:03.558]  Listen to the phrase, no jab, no pay.
[02:40:03.558 --> 02:40:04.319]  Take a listen to this.
[02:40:06.292 --> 02:40:08.814]  Absolutely no doubt about that.
[02:40:08.814 --> 02:40:22.169]  But there will be strong, you know, I suspect the majority of Australians will get vaccinated and there will be a strong public view that those who choose not to get vaccinated need to
[02:40:25.452 --> 02:40:36.160]  There needs to be some sort of incentive stick, perhaps, through the current programs, including No Jab No Pay, to make that happen.
[02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:42.665]  So I think that is a very reasonable interpretation of what the PM had to say today.
[02:40:42.665 --> 02:40:50.431]  Again, looking at specific things like not being able to go into restaurants, not being able to travel internationally, not...
[02:40:52.312 --> 02:40:53.273]  Did you hear that?
[02:40:53.273 --> 02:40:55.675]  And he used the phrase, no jab, no pay.
[02:40:55.675 --> 02:41:03.181]  I've also heard in Australia, no jab, no play, that kids would not be allowed to go to school, to join sports leagues, to go to clubs.
[02:41:03.181 --> 02:41:05.683]  But I've watched that clip about four times.
[02:41:05.683 --> 02:41:08.085]  Every time he says, no jab, no pay.
[02:41:08.085 --> 02:41:12.849]  By jab, that means taking the vaccine.
[02:41:12.849 --> 02:41:15.191]  No going to a restaurant.
[02:41:15.191 --> 02:41:15.892]  No travel.
[02:41:17.455 --> 02:41:18.716]  And how would all this be tracked?
[02:41:18.716 --> 02:41:18.976]  Why?
[02:41:18.976 --> 02:41:23.718]  It's by the same sources where the vaccine, in that case, would come from, from China.
[02:41:23.718 --> 02:41:26.300]  China's social credit system.
[02:41:26.300 --> 02:41:30.402]  They're getting you conditioned to using the apps, these tracing apps, these warning apps.
[02:41:30.402 --> 02:41:31.902]  Just go on the app.
[02:41:31.902 --> 02:41:35.624]  We promise your privacy is protected.
[02:41:35.624 --> 02:41:40.767]  We only have a few minutes left in the show before I hand it over to Nick Begich, who will take over the top of the hour.
[02:41:42.156 --> 02:41:50.179]  But I told you that I'm in Canada, and rebelnews.com is the name of our company, but we're in America, we're in Canada, in the UK.
[02:41:50.179 --> 02:41:55.321]  We've got a journalist in Australia, you've probably seen him on the internet, he fights like hell.
[02:41:55.321 --> 02:42:06.726]  And I just showed you that clip of the Australian Cabinet Minister saying Australians should get used to the idea of no jab, no pay, you can't go to a restaurant, you can't travel, but it's voluntary vaccine, mind you.
[02:42:07.882 --> 02:42:12.063]  Avi Yamini, our reporter down under, has been covering the lockdowns there.
[02:42:12.063 --> 02:42:16.584]  And in the Australian state of Victoria, they've had the strictest lockdowns in the world.
[02:42:16.584 --> 02:42:18.665]  Even stricter than China.
[02:42:18.665 --> 02:42:20.185]  Police checkpoints on the road.
[02:42:20.185 --> 02:42:22.926]  Fines for being more than five kilometers from your house.
[02:42:22.926 --> 02:42:24.266]  Curfews, of course.
[02:42:24.266 --> 02:42:26.607]  Permits to go out.
[02:42:26.607 --> 02:42:28.687]  Avi's been personally assaulted by police.
[02:42:28.687 --> 02:42:32.388]  He's suing police right now for a false arrest and assault.
[02:42:33.536 --> 02:42:38.817]  So that was covering the pandemic protests, the anti-lockdown protests.
[02:42:38.817 --> 02:42:43.659]  But there was a global warming protest just last week in Australia.
[02:42:43.659 --> 02:42:49.720]  And like the Black Lives Matter protests earlier this summer, the police couldn't be happier about it.
[02:42:49.720 --> 02:42:54.841]  They were rolling out the red carpet for Black Lives Matter protests and global warming protests.
[02:42:54.841 --> 02:43:01.563]  But Avi Yamini, one of our journalists who has been skeptical of the lockdown, I want you to see
[02:43:02.876 --> 02:43:15.585]  How using the powers of the pandemic lockdown, using the health emergency, in Australia, which is one of the freest countries in the world, they went after our reporter.
[02:43:15.585 --> 02:43:18.307]  We won't watch the whole clip, but let's watch a good few minutes of this.
[02:43:18.307 --> 02:43:22.270]  Take a look.
[02:43:22.270 --> 02:43:23.711]  Hey, how you going?
[02:43:23.711 --> 02:43:24.812]  Yes, what's your name, please?
[02:43:24.812 --> 02:43:25.533]  Avi Mini.
[02:43:25.533 --> 02:43:27.874]  Yes, can you please get some identification for me?
[02:43:27.874 --> 02:43:29.375]  That's my media press card.
[02:43:29.375 --> 02:43:30.196]  Government, Commonwealth,
[02:43:31.189 --> 02:43:31.409]  Yep.
[02:43:31.409 --> 02:43:32.829]  Do you have your driver's licence on you?
[02:43:32.829 --> 02:43:35.730]  I do too, yeah, but that's my government-issued... Can I please see it?
[02:43:35.730 --> 02:43:36.230]  Yeah, yeah, no problem.
[02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:39.311]  Do you want a copy of my passport or my licence?
[02:43:39.311 --> 02:43:44.151]  Either one of those would be fine, thanks.
[02:43:44.151 --> 02:43:46.532]  There you go.
[02:43:46.532 --> 02:43:47.692]  You're not here to protest, are you?
[02:43:47.692 --> 02:43:53.813]  No, no, I've got my Commonwealth-issued from the Australian Government press pass.
[02:43:53.813 --> 02:43:54.713]  You're very happy with that, aren't you?
[02:43:54.713 --> 02:43:57.914]  I am, I really love it because that's my press pass.
[02:43:59.378 --> 02:44:03.439]  Can you spell your first name for me please?
[02:44:03.439 --> 02:44:04.199]  Avraham.
[02:44:04.199 --> 02:44:07.620]  A-V-R-A-H-A-M.
[02:44:07.620 --> 02:44:08.460]  Surname?
[02:44:08.460 --> 02:44:09.040]  Yamini.
[02:44:09.040 --> 02:44:13.361]  Y-A-M-I-N-I.
[02:44:13.361 --> 02:44:16.222]  Do you have a birth, please?
[02:44:16.222 --> 02:44:16.882]  17-10-85.
[02:44:16.882 --> 02:44:18.182]  What's your purpose for being here?
[02:44:18.182 --> 02:44:22.663]  I'm covering, there's a... That's okay, I'm working in the media.
[02:44:22.663 --> 02:44:23.504]  Do you have your...
[02:44:26.323 --> 02:44:33.445]  A copy of my permit I don't have on me now, to be honest, but... OK, you don't have your copy of your permit on you, so I'm going to ask you to leave.
[02:44:33.445 --> 02:44:34.846]  You're outside of your 25 feet.
[02:44:34.846 --> 02:44:36.926]  Sorry, I'll get a copy now sent to you here.
[02:44:36.926 --> 02:44:39.287]  I'm not going to move on.
[02:44:39.287 --> 02:44:41.548]  Like, with all due respect, this is my job.
[02:44:41.548 --> 02:44:42.308]  This is what I'm paid for.
[02:44:42.308 --> 02:44:43.408]  You're doing your job.
[02:44:43.408 --> 02:44:44.929]  Nobody's hindering you from doing your job.
[02:44:44.929 --> 02:44:45.969]  You know who I am very well.
[02:44:46.377 --> 02:44:48.900]  We have a current case with Victoria Police in the Supreme Court.
[02:44:48.900 --> 02:44:53.625]  The last couple of rallies, you've understood that, and we've worked really well together.
[02:44:53.625 --> 02:44:57.490]  I'm not here to bother you guys from doing your job, but you're not going to move me on from doing my job.
[02:44:57.490 --> 02:45:00.773]  I can give you a copy of my worker's permit.
[02:45:00.773 --> 02:45:01.494]  I'll get that sent now.
[02:45:05.859 --> 02:45:11.163]  But, uh, and otherwise I will feel one another one out here right now.
[02:45:11.163 --> 02:45:21.810]  Otherwise, you can go ahead and issue whatever fine you want to issue while I'm doing my job with my Commonwealth press card, which is quite obvious what I'm doing here, working.
[02:45:24.735 --> 02:45:25.655]  It's interesting, isn't it?
[02:45:25.655 --> 02:45:38.198]  There's been zero cases for a week now, and they're trying to intimidate me to leave from doing my job because I forgot the piece of paper back at home, which is more than 25Ks from here.
[02:45:38.198 --> 02:45:40.539]  This is all because of coronavirus.
[02:45:40.539 --> 02:45:42.419]  Coronavirus.
[02:45:42.419 --> 02:45:46.860]  For your safety at home, right now, this is what's happening.
[02:45:46.860 --> 02:45:49.981]  The funny thing is, every other protest in this state
[02:45:52.024 --> 02:45:55.106]  Since Black Lives Matter have been met with brute force.
[02:45:55.106 --> 02:45:56.667]  You saw it Tuesday.
[02:45:56.667 --> 02:46:02.351]  Pepper spray to deploy it on peaceful protest.
[02:46:02.351 --> 02:46:09.877]  But today for some reason there's a big police presence and there are some protesters that set up a stand.
[02:46:09.877 --> 02:46:11.778]  Suddenly COVID is fine.
[02:46:11.778 --> 02:46:16.262]  The problem is Avi Yamini is outside of his 25 kilometres.
[02:46:16.262 --> 02:46:18.083]  We better jail him.
[02:46:18.083 --> 02:46:18.844]  I think that's a good idea.
[02:46:19.793 --> 02:46:21.153]  I need to fill out another work permit.
[02:46:21.153 --> 02:46:23.234]  I forgot.
[02:46:23.234 --> 02:46:24.314]  Can you bring it?
[02:46:24.314 --> 02:46:24.794]  Thank you.
[02:46:24.794 --> 02:46:27.135]  And a pen.
[02:46:27.135 --> 02:46:30.495]  Guys, no matter what they think about Monica, she's actually alright.
[02:46:30.495 --> 02:46:31.856]  They know who you are, though.
[02:46:31.856 --> 02:46:32.456]  I know.
[02:46:32.456 --> 02:46:36.277]  They're having a laugh.
[02:46:36.277 --> 02:46:38.497]  That's our reporter, Avi Yamini.
[02:46:38.497 --> 02:46:39.698]  The police know who he is.
[02:46:39.698 --> 02:46:41.418]  He's suing those police for
[02:46:42.262 --> 02:46:46.604]  Arresting him, throwing him to the ground at a previous pandemic rally.
[02:46:46.604 --> 02:46:47.704]  By the way, he's not a protester.
[02:46:47.704 --> 02:46:49.425]  He's a journalist, as you can see.
[02:46:49.425 --> 02:46:50.466]  Did you see the hassle?
[02:46:50.466 --> 02:46:52.907]  And I don't know if you heard those key words.
[02:46:52.907 --> 02:46:54.927]  I have my permit.
[02:46:54.927 --> 02:46:56.188]  I have my press pass.
[02:46:59.015 --> 02:47:03.116]  The kind of paperwork and rules and red tape, you heard he mentioned 25 kilometers.
[02:47:03.116 --> 02:47:08.957]  They recently released, it used to be a five kilometer from your house rule, now it's 25 kilometers.
[02:47:08.957 --> 02:47:14.698]  There's not a single case of the virus in the entire Australian state of Victoria.
[02:47:14.698 --> 02:47:17.718]  It's about six and a half million people, the main city of Melbourne.
[02:47:17.718 --> 02:47:19.639]  There's not a single case.
[02:47:19.639 --> 02:47:21.039]  And did you see what those police were doing?
[02:47:21.039 --> 02:47:25.680]  They didn't like Avi, he's been a burr under their saddle, been a pain in their neck.
[02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:26.020]  And so,
[02:47:26.952 --> 02:47:28.053]  Where's your papers?
[02:47:28.053 --> 02:47:29.433]  Your papers?
[02:47:29.433 --> 02:47:30.514]  They interrupted him.
[02:47:30.514 --> 02:47:33.895]  He was interviewing someone at this global warming rally.
[02:47:33.895 --> 02:47:35.796]  But they honed in on him.
[02:47:35.796 --> 02:47:37.677]  And what gives them that power?
[02:47:37.677 --> 02:47:39.998]  What gives them that right?
[02:47:39.998 --> 02:47:42.039]  The pandemic, obviously.
[02:47:42.039 --> 02:47:42.899]  But we have to do it.
[02:47:42.899 --> 02:47:45.040]  It's an emergency.
[02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:45.400]  Look at that.
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:49.602]  He was interviewing that man and they just came right in and said, show us your papers.
[02:47:49.602 --> 02:47:52.303]  And they knocked him off his course for 10 minutes there.
[02:47:54.002 --> 02:47:59.285]  And I don't know if you heard that one cop said, I'm going to ask you to leave.
[02:47:59.285 --> 02:48:02.687]  The implication being if you don't leave, you'll be arrested.
[02:48:02.687 --> 02:48:07.629]  Now we're suing them on behalf of Avi and I think we're going to win.
[02:48:07.629 --> 02:48:09.310]  I've only got a few seconds left here today.
[02:48:09.310 --> 02:48:15.253]  It's been a pleasure being with you, telling you a little bit of what's going on in Canada and Australia.
[02:48:15.253 --> 02:48:19.035]  If you want to learn more, go to our website, rebelnews.com.
[02:48:20.120 --> 02:48:29.028]  You can see, I mean, there's a story right there, a great story, about a conservative MP who is for the lockdown, so all the bars in this city have banned him for life.
[02:48:29.028 --> 02:48:30.609]  I love that story.
[02:48:30.609 --> 02:48:32.131]  All right, it's time for me to say goodbye.
[02:48:32.131 --> 02:48:34.393]  Up next is Nick Begich.
[02:48:34.393 --> 02:48:36.134]  Go to rebelnews.com and take a look around.
[02:48:36.134 --> 02:48:38.557]  Alex Jones here with an important message to all of our listeners and viewers.
[02:48:38.557 --> 02:48:39.998]  I want to thank you for your support over the years.
[02:48:39.998 --> 02:48:45.403]  I want to thank you for having skin in the game, and no one has had more skin in the game than our president.
[02:48:45.823 --> 02:48:46.844]  And he needs our prayers.
[02:48:46.844 --> 02:48:47.784]  He needs our support.
[02:48:47.784 --> 02:48:49.626]  He is the president.
[02:48:49.626 --> 02:48:51.387]  Secretary of State Pompeo understands.
[02:48:51.387 --> 02:48:58.351]  That's why he said yesterday there will be a smooth transition from this Trump administration into the next Trump administration.
[02:48:58.351 --> 02:49:03.555]  Because in all the major states where they're still counting, they are gaining ground.
[02:49:03.555 --> 02:49:15.283]  That is President Trump, Republican Party, the American people, the populace, the patriots, the enemy, the Democrats, backed by the shycoms, backed by the European Union, backed by Hollywood, backed by the left, the blue cities, the blue states.
[02:49:15.743 --> 02:49:18.544]  They are in a rage trying to gaslight us.
[02:49:18.544 --> 02:49:20.384]  Keep calling Biden president-elect.
[02:49:20.384 --> 02:49:20.664]  He's not.
[02:49:20.664 --> 02:49:26.526]  The president has to concede and or all of the states have to certify the vote, which hasn't happened yet.
[02:49:26.526 --> 02:49:30.787]  And then you have to have the electors seek who is going to be the president.
[02:49:30.787 --> 02:49:32.907]  And this may be a dispute that goes back to the states.
[02:49:32.907 --> 02:49:34.348]  That's why it's in the Constitution.
[02:49:34.348 --> 02:49:35.448]  And the Constitution is kicking in.
[02:49:37.768 --> 02:49:39.249]  It's all on record.
[02:49:39.249 --> 02:49:54.402]  Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, they were all hired a year ago and then again six months ago to war game how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic and how to get the public to take inoculations.
[02:49:54.402 --> 02:49:57.125]  And they talk about calling people heroes that do it.
[02:49:57.125 --> 02:49:59.126]  They talk about shaming those that don't.
[02:49:59.126 --> 02:50:01.248]  This has all been psychologically tested.
[02:50:02.509 --> 02:50:04.230]  It's all been psychologically prepared.
[02:50:04.230 --> 02:50:08.552]  And once they get you to lock down for 15 days, you notice now they say it's permanent.
[02:50:08.552 --> 02:50:09.232]  That's how it works.
[02:50:09.232 --> 02:50:11.594]  Oh, just put these handcuffs on.
[02:50:11.594 --> 02:50:14.895]  The serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be alright.
[02:50:14.895 --> 02:50:15.696]  No.
[02:50:15.696 --> 02:50:20.618]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van.
[02:50:20.618 --> 02:50:25.100]  He's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death.
[02:50:25.100 --> 02:50:25.981]  That's the allegory.
[02:50:26.741 --> 02:50:28.202]  We gotta bust out of this thing now.
[02:50:28.202 --> 02:50:29.342]  We gotta say no now.
[02:50:29.342 --> 02:50:31.903]  We gotta make a run for it now, but we still can't.
[02:50:31.903 --> 02:50:35.245]  Once he gets us in that basement, it's gonna get a lot, lot worse, folks.
[02:50:35.245 --> 02:50:40.087]  So stop submitting.
[02:50:40.087 --> 02:50:42.688]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:02.168 --> 02:51:06.989]  And welcome, welcome back to the fourth hour of InfoWars.
[02:51:06.989 --> 02:51:14.052]  And it's interesting, you know, here in Alaska today, we're on the third Friday, the 13th, 2020.
[02:51:14.052 --> 02:51:19.433]  And just before noon here, snow's on the ground.
[02:51:19.433 --> 02:51:20.734]  It's cold again.
[02:51:20.734 --> 02:51:21.874]  It's dark again.
[02:51:21.874 --> 02:51:23.654]  We're back to winter.
[02:51:23.654 --> 02:51:28.856]  And so kind of the backdrop of the nation right now, a little gloomy.
[02:51:29.791 --> 02:51:34.995]  A little dark, a little bit gold.
[02:51:34.995 --> 02:51:39.118]  Really, what a mess the last couple of weeks have been.
[02:51:39.118 --> 02:51:52.829]  Talking about the last hour and listening to a lot of the commentary about China and kind of how this all goes and what rolls out in Canada in terms of perceived next steps and
[02:51:54.148 --> 02:51:57.189]  Man, it looks more like China every day, doesn't it?
[02:51:57.189 --> 02:51:59.950]  But we give it different names.
[02:51:59.950 --> 02:52:02.011]  It's so bizarre.
[02:52:02.011 --> 02:52:09.673]  And I was talking last week about this book, Unrestricted Warfare, and this is written by two Chinese colonels.
[02:52:09.673 --> 02:52:12.594]  It was written in the late 90s.
[02:52:12.594 --> 02:52:15.175]  So it's, you know, it's 20 years dated.
[02:52:15.175 --> 02:52:18.897]  And why I want to talk about this is because we're in that war.
[02:52:18.897 --> 02:52:22.798]  You see, it started in the late 90s and the Chinese announced it.
[02:52:23.750 --> 02:52:36.759]  And it involved a lot of different aspects, and I'm going to get into those aspects over the next hour, because none of them had anything to do with the old concepts of war, you know, tanks, bullets, bombs.
[02:52:36.759 --> 02:52:43.944]  And see, I've been talking about this for 25 years, as long as the Chinese have, as a matter of fact.
[02:52:43.944 --> 02:52:52.010]  And because we could read the literature, what was in the open literature then, and pretty clearly conclude where we were headed,
[02:52:52.717 --> 02:53:01.499]  Now, and so now all these reports come out as if, oh my gosh, what are we going to do?
[02:53:01.499 --> 02:53:03.919]  Well, it's been going on a long time.
[02:53:03.919 --> 02:53:07.259]  InfoWars have been talking about this for a long time.
[02:53:07.259 --> 02:53:10.560]  We've been talking about this for a very long time.
[02:53:10.560 --> 02:53:15.161]  Let's talk about what some of the aspects of unrestricted warfare might look like.
[02:53:15.161 --> 02:53:17.741]  How about a drug war?
[02:53:17.741 --> 02:53:21.762]  You're not the one that we've been seeing, but the one mentioned here.
[02:53:22.697 --> 02:53:48.753]  The drug war, the Chinese mention, is a war where they introduce drugs that damage a population, you know, like fentanyl, like things that you're expecting to be safe, like baby formula, you know, these kinds of things where, ah, little contamination here, a little contamination there, and then something even more direct, how about just
[02:53:49.542 --> 02:53:51.624]  Find a way to get that fentanyl in.
[02:53:51.624 --> 02:53:58.430]  Maybe we bring it through Mexico, through the drug cartels there, because they're always looking for new arrangements.
[02:53:58.430 --> 02:54:01.993]  But you have to start thinking about this in a very different way.
[02:54:01.993 --> 02:54:06.197]  Unrestricted Warfare, the book covers on the screen for those that can see it.
[02:54:06.197 --> 02:54:08.839]  But here's the thing about all that.
[02:54:08.839 --> 02:54:11.262]  Let's talk about the drug war a little bit more.
[02:54:11.262 --> 02:54:14.384]  You think that might be happening in the United States?
[02:54:14.384 --> 02:54:14.825]  Hmm.
[02:54:15.703 --> 02:54:20.486]  The source of a lot of this fentanyl killing thousands of Americans.
[02:54:20.486 --> 02:54:21.746]  Hmm.
[02:54:21.746 --> 02:54:23.767]  Hmm.
[02:54:23.767 --> 02:54:27.309]  Sounds to me like a weaponized system, right?
[02:54:27.309 --> 02:54:28.870]  And here's what this book says.
[02:54:28.870 --> 02:54:31.952]  It says everything.
[02:54:31.952 --> 02:54:34.033]  Let me say that again.
[02:54:34.033 --> 02:54:41.337]  Everything can be a weapon in the 21st century in the way the Chinese play it.
[02:54:41.337 --> 02:54:44.259]  And they don't make bones about it.
[02:54:44.259 --> 02:54:45.079]  They write about it.
[02:54:45.993 --> 02:55:09.510]  Publish it freely, circulate it, and then their friends in the West give it a new package, a new narrative, a new bunch of words to describe something that's still poop, garbage, junk, you know, not at all what is interesting and useful to living, thriving souls.
[02:55:10.413 --> 02:55:16.560]  But what's really convenient for crushing the West, let's talk about some of the other things.
[02:55:16.560 --> 02:55:19.523]  How about financial war?
[02:55:19.523 --> 02:55:21.565]  We're going to talk about financial war.
[02:55:21.565 --> 02:55:23.768]  We're going to talk about how about
[02:55:24.642 --> 02:55:27.484]  Information war, from the Chinese perspective.
[02:55:27.484 --> 02:55:32.108]  Entertainment, news coverage, taking over the networks.
[02:55:32.108 --> 02:55:33.789]  You think that's happening?
[02:55:33.789 --> 02:55:35.910]  Hey, let's get into this today.
[02:55:35.910 --> 02:55:40.494]  Let's talk about the Chai Com's real moves and their allies in the New World Order.
[02:55:40.494 --> 02:55:41.554]  This is Dr. Nick Feggish.
[02:55:41.554 --> 02:55:42.175]  We'll be right back.
[02:55:44.901 --> 02:55:47.382]  America is in crisis.
[02:55:47.382 --> 02:55:52.243]  Emergency Lockdown 2 is coming under Biden.
[02:55:52.243 --> 02:55:58.504]  Support InfoWars, the fight against total economic collapse, and Biden's martial law disguised as Lockdown 2.

[02:56:16.315 --> 02:56:20.599]  These are game-changing things that the globalists don't need to have.

[02:56:40.233 --> 02:56:42.834]  Please take action today in our emergency center.
[02:56:55.968 --> 02:57:01.573]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show with Nick Begich!
[02:57:04.993 --> 02:57:05.893]  And welcome back.
[02:57:05.893 --> 02:57:08.615]  You know, I'm thinking about unrespected warfare.
[02:57:08.615 --> 02:57:13.059]  And just before the break, we're talking about the concept of financial war.
[02:57:13.059 --> 02:57:14.560]  Now, think about it.
[02:57:14.560 --> 02:57:24.308]  And in this text, it also talks about Soros and what he was doing in the 90s in terms of crushing economies financially as a non-state actor.
[02:57:24.308 --> 02:57:24.608]  Okay.
[02:57:24.608 --> 02:57:26.990]  Or at least officially a non-state actor.
[02:57:26.990 --> 02:57:28.671]  Okay.
[02:57:28.671 --> 02:57:31.714]  But here's something to consider about non-state actors.
[02:57:32.576 --> 02:57:39.022]  When governments find a friendly actor that has some capacity, they like to corrupt them.
[02:57:39.022 --> 02:57:40.804]  They like to actually own them.
[02:57:40.804 --> 02:57:45.648]  Because think about this, a modern bomber might cost you two, three billion dollars.
[02:57:45.648 --> 02:57:47.870]  Just one, just one bomber.
[02:57:47.870 --> 02:57:53.475]  And for a fraction of the price, you too can bribe and corrupt hundreds of government officials.
[02:57:54.133 --> 02:57:57.955]  You know, so this is what really goes on with the Deep State.
[02:57:57.955 --> 02:58:02.959]  It's about not just government, private companies, whoever you can corrupt that will serve your bidding.
[02:58:02.959 --> 02:58:08.102]  You see, this is one of the methods in unrestricted warfare.
[02:58:08.102 --> 02:58:10.043]  Okay, financial warfare.
[02:58:10.043 --> 02:58:13.505]  Now, I talked a little bit about Soros, but how about the Chinese?
[02:58:13.505 --> 02:58:18.068]  They own the banks that gave, oh, excuse me,
[02:58:19.088 --> 02:58:27.311]  Set up Hunter Biden, and if you've watched the videos, would you guys want this guy managing anything for you?
[02:58:27.311 --> 02:58:29.632]  Any of your money at all?
[02:58:29.632 --> 02:58:36.235]  This guy, Mr. Unreliable, would you want that happening with your billion and a half dollars?
[02:58:36.235 --> 02:58:40.376]  Less than the price of a bomber, you get Biden and all of his contacts.
[02:58:40.376 --> 02:58:43.497]  Think of his Rolodex that ran through the news, right?
[02:58:43.497 --> 02:58:45.078]  All the major players.
[02:58:46.030 --> 02:58:57.754]  So you come in under the radar screen, corrupt a few people on the peripheral, and then dive on in and start picking the low-hanging fruit and work your way up to the top branches.
[02:58:57.754 --> 02:59:01.275]  This is what is done in unrestricted warfare.
[02:59:01.275 --> 02:59:02.436]  Financial warfare.
[02:59:02.436 --> 02:59:03.056]  Think about this.
[02:59:03.056 --> 02:59:06.417]  These guys went from riding bicycles all around Beijing.
[02:59:06.417 --> 02:59:14.980]  There's even a song about it, you know, about bicycles in Beijing, you know, because that's what we saw in 1971 was a bunch of bicycles.
[02:59:15.828 --> 02:59:23.411]  Now, no one's laughing, no one's joking anymore, because we all did it.
[02:59:23.411 --> 02:59:30.974]  You, me, and everyone else that consumed every little Chinese widget and piece of garbage, because there was nothing else on the market.
[02:59:30.974 --> 02:59:37.576]  So we, they made sure this pipeline of money through consumption flowed right into China.
[02:59:37.576 --> 02:59:41.618]  But you know, consumption kind of came to a screeching halt, right?
[02:59:42.682 --> 02:59:43.842]  Not happening right now.
[02:59:43.842 --> 02:59:53.045]  A lot of people kind of holding back, except the financial sector, which just disconnected from the real world and went into financial illusion.
[02:59:53.045 --> 03:00:04.368]  This is a financial war, ladies and gentlemen, and it has a design and a purpose, and it's intended to grab us by the private parts and drag us through the streets of China.
[03:00:04.368 --> 03:00:08.309]  Only it's everywhere now because this is how it works.
[03:00:09.406 --> 03:00:14.470]  You're in the digital gulag already.
[03:00:14.470 --> 03:00:15.811]  Wake up.
[03:00:15.811 --> 03:00:17.693]  Time to wake up.
[03:00:17.693 --> 03:00:20.495]  Time to wake up.
[03:00:20.495 --> 03:00:25.419]  Because the game is afoot and has been played out a long time.
[03:00:25.419 --> 03:00:27.000]  Think about financial war.
[03:00:27.000 --> 03:00:33.725]  Think about the Chinese acquiring all these treasuries and sucking them all up and grabbing all these dollars.
[03:00:33.725 --> 03:00:34.686]  And then everyone goes,
[03:00:35.495 --> 03:00:37.420]  Then what are they doing with those dollars?
[03:00:37.420 --> 03:00:43.353]  Well, they're playing part of the financial war, which is grabbing everybody else's stuff.
[03:00:43.353 --> 03:00:45.619]  And instead of going over there and just taking it,
[03:00:46.232 --> 03:00:47.332]  You pay for it.
[03:00:47.332 --> 03:00:57.635]  You give them fiat, you know, and they're grabbing fiat, grabbing all the currency they can, and then they're buying assets, real stuff with that, all over the world.
[03:00:57.635 --> 03:01:00.736]  And they're outbidding American companies and European companies.
[03:01:00.736 --> 03:01:04.377]  We're going, they're crazy to pay those kind of prices.
[03:01:04.377 --> 03:01:05.717]  They're crazy.
[03:01:05.717 --> 03:01:07.658]  But no, they're not.
[03:01:07.658 --> 03:01:09.138]  Because they take a long view.
[03:01:09.138 --> 03:01:10.479]  They're not thinking about the next quarter.
[03:01:10.479 --> 03:01:11.939]  They're thinking about the next century.
[03:01:13.197 --> 03:01:17.080]  The next century, you see, the long game.
[03:01:17.080 --> 03:01:21.783]  And the long game says you buy up all the chips.
[03:01:21.783 --> 03:01:26.105]  Foreign aid as a concept for warfare.
[03:01:26.105 --> 03:01:28.087]  Chinese spell it out in that same book.
[03:01:28.087 --> 03:01:37.393]  You know, foreign aid, a way to come on in and be your friends as they grab you again from those private parts and drag you through the streets.
[03:01:37.393 --> 03:01:42.096]  Only now you're smiling about it because your cash register's full.
[03:01:42.096 --> 03:01:42.416]  Until...
[03:01:43.308 --> 03:01:46.769]  The game is afoot again, and they decided to just take your stuff.
[03:01:46.769 --> 03:01:50.709]  So they blackmailed you, they've got your Swiss account, you know, all wired in.
[03:01:50.709 --> 03:01:53.730]  You know, this is how it really works.
[03:01:53.730 --> 03:01:55.830]  They have no restrictions.
[03:01:55.830 --> 03:01:58.811]  There are no rules.
[03:01:58.811 --> 03:02:02.592]  Okay, let me say that again.
[03:02:02.592 --> 03:02:05.712]  There are no rules.
[03:02:05.712 --> 03:02:08.773]  Okay, this is how it is actually playing out.
[03:02:09.477 --> 03:02:14.619]  That's why America can torture people and kidnap people and extort people.
[03:02:14.619 --> 03:02:19.081]  We do that too, you see, because there are no rules.
[03:02:19.081 --> 03:02:20.922]  We have the illusion of rulemaking.
[03:02:20.922 --> 03:02:37.209]  And this is also part of a warfare front identified by the Chinese non-state actors and regulatory body, like the United Nations, like the World Health Organization, like the World Monetary Fund.
[03:02:38.138 --> 03:02:45.203]  These organizations, the Chinese, have a deliberate mission to corrupt them and use them.
[03:02:45.203 --> 03:02:50.126]  And remember, nobody voted for any of these people.
[03:02:50.126 --> 03:02:54.269]  No one voted for any of them.
[03:02:54.269 --> 03:02:58.051]  And everything being equal, right?
[03:02:58.051 --> 03:02:59.953]  Do you want a billion Chinese?
[03:02:59.953 --> 03:03:06.137]  Because if it was a democratic world after all, they would decide, right?
[03:03:06.137 --> 03:03:07.498]  A lot more than they do.
[03:03:08.346 --> 03:03:09.847]  Is Satoko okay with you?
[03:03:09.847 --> 03:03:11.007]  It's not okay with me.
[03:03:11.007 --> 03:03:15.469]  Within the sovereign boundaries of this country, it is not okay with me.
[03:03:15.469 --> 03:03:20.511]  One of the other fronts is just information generally, and how do they come into that information?
[03:03:20.511 --> 03:03:30.275]  Well, they can't own the news media as foreign actors and not being clearly identified, but they can own the entertainment industry, maybe a chunk of the textbook industry.
[03:03:31.303 --> 03:03:42.985]  You know, the intellectual property industry that begins to frame the way future generations see the world through the illusion of the window of the world.
[03:03:42.985 --> 03:03:45.466]  TV, right?
[03:03:45.466 --> 03:03:47.366]  The screen.
[03:03:47.366 --> 03:03:51.087]  The propaganda tool of the 21st century.
[03:03:51.087 --> 03:03:54.987]  It's either to educate or manipulate.
[03:03:54.987 --> 03:03:57.088]  That's all it's for.
[03:03:57.088 --> 03:03:58.848]  Educate or manipulate.
[03:03:59.508 --> 03:04:00.489]  That's it.
[03:04:00.489 --> 03:04:03.552]  The games of manipulation are obvious.
[03:04:03.552 --> 03:04:12.199]  It's charge you up, take the vacuum out of your brain, keep the messages simple, and get you to start repeating them even if you don't believe.
[03:04:12.199 --> 03:04:15.222]  Through political correctness, shut down the consciousness.
[03:04:15.222 --> 03:04:18.825]  This is all so simply orchestrated.
[03:04:19.349 --> 03:04:33.012]  If you generate fear, anxiety, all of those things, you shut down higher order thinking, keep the messaging simple, get the sheep to move like a herd, and man, you can push them around any way you want.
[03:04:33.012 --> 03:04:46.195]  Whether you live in China, whether you live in Central Europe, or whether you live in the wonderful USA, or our friends in Canada, as we've been hearing in the last hour, what's about to happen to them.
[03:04:46.195 --> 03:04:48.116]  I've talked to some of my friends in Canada,
[03:04:48.800 --> 03:05:05.266]  Recently in the last week now one of my good friends who's used to traveling a lot internationally as part of his normal life has been locked down since March and I'm listening to the conversation and there's way too much acceptance as this as okay.
[03:05:06.717 --> 03:05:08.799]  And I don't like that part of OK.
[03:05:08.799 --> 03:05:24.631]  I think these challenges moving up to the Supreme Court eventually about what is appropriate in terms of personal liberty and freedom within the context of the 21st century, with the context of maybe a Chinese virus, which also is part of the program, right?
[03:05:24.631 --> 03:05:26.512]  If you can use this.
[03:05:26.512 --> 03:05:32.797]  The first time we all thought about, you know, biological weapons was when we handed off blankets to Indians, right?
[03:05:32.797 --> 03:05:33.918]  To indigenous people.
[03:05:34.498 --> 03:05:37.980]  We handed off blankets with smallpox.
[03:05:37.980 --> 03:05:44.823]  You know, we wiped out thousands, maybe millions even, with some of that.
[03:05:44.823 --> 03:05:47.705]  So this isn't really anything new.
[03:05:47.705 --> 03:05:51.807]  It's just got a new framework, a new narrative surrounding it.
[03:05:51.807 --> 03:05:54.789]  Makes everyone feel good being in jail.
[03:05:54.789 --> 03:05:59.071]  We're all under house arrest right now, in case you haven't noticed.
[03:05:59.071 --> 03:06:03.213]  That's what this is, actually, house arrest.
[03:06:04.319 --> 03:06:06.260]  Oh, and the Deutsche Bank.
[03:06:06.260 --> 03:06:14.826]  What they want to do now in Europe is tax Europeans 5% for staying at home and working out of your home because it costs you less money.
[03:06:14.826 --> 03:06:18.368]  You don't have to commute, you don't have to buy lunch, all those things.
[03:06:18.368 --> 03:06:21.369]  So they want you to pay a 5% stay-at-home tax.
[03:06:21.369 --> 03:06:21.990]  So now they're going to
[03:06:22.490 --> 03:06:25.433]  Put you under house arrest, and you're gonna pay for it.
[03:06:25.433 --> 03:06:28.175]  This is the new world order, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:06:28.175 --> 03:06:31.258]  Welcome to the 21st century, but we still have time.
[03:06:31.258 --> 03:06:33.760]  The hour is late, but the hour's not gone.
[03:06:33.760 --> 03:06:34.881]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:06:34.881 --> 03:06:35.502]  We'll be right back.
[03:06:42.793 --> 03:06:55.521]  Look, we all know that CNN is the epitome of fake news, but there's a headline on their site today that says, there are disinformation groups and organizations saying Joe Biden is not president-elect.
[03:06:55.521 --> 03:07:07.608]  Well, on its face, he's not president-elect, because the votes have not been certified by any of the 50 states, and counting is still going on, what, in seven of the states?
[03:07:07.608 --> 03:07:10.930]  And Trump is gaining ground in all but one of them.
[03:07:11.752 --> 03:07:17.313]  And then there's also going to be recounts, audits, and all the spot checks have already shown NASA fraud.
[03:07:17.313 --> 03:07:21.034]  But, in comes the ace card, the ace of spades.
[03:07:21.034 --> 03:07:31.197]  Big Tech censorship is blocking not just the President, not just members of Congress, but tens of millions of Americans from even sharing local news stations confirming the fraud.
[03:07:31.197 --> 03:07:34.837]  This is a foreign-backed, multinational takeover of the United States.
[03:07:34.837 --> 03:07:36.658]  Trump is battling a Chinese-backed,
[03:07:37.598 --> 03:07:42.781]  New World Order system bent on keeping us locked down forever in an economic war and bringing us to our knees.
[03:07:42.781 --> 03:07:44.662]  You know, something very sad is happening.
[03:07:44.662 --> 03:07:51.466]  It's very sad because it was all avoidable two and a half years ago when Infowars got banned off of more than 60 major platforms.
[03:07:51.466 --> 03:07:52.767]  I warn everybody that was a precedent.
[03:07:53.467 --> 03:08:06.930]  For the upcoming presidential election and that they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship until effectively there was a total internet kill switch in place against conservatives, nationals and populists.
[03:08:06.930 --> 03:08:08.250]  And now that's happened.
[03:08:08.250 --> 03:08:21.713]  And then I told everybody that they would then start moving to arrest individuals that demonstrate and protest using a second COVID-19 lockdown and that Trump needed to get out front and fully repudiate COVID-19 is basically an overblown hoax.
[03:08:22.333 --> 03:08:29.335]  He started to do that the last few months of the campaign, but we have to understand that that's the pincer attack they're going to use.
[03:08:29.335 --> 03:08:38.117]  They're going to use Black Lives Matter and race war to stir up the American people and divide us, and they're going to use economic warfare shutting down the economy to try to control us.
[03:08:38.117 --> 03:08:45.418]  I hope people will listen now to my warnings because I'm on air telling people what's coming next.
[03:08:45.418 --> 03:08:47.999]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:58.752 --> 03:09:05.625]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:09:05.625 --> 03:09:09.132]  And now, your host, Nick Vagic.
[03:09:12.336 --> 03:09:13.196]  And welcome back.
[03:09:13.196 --> 03:09:21.939]  You know, I always forget to run my own ad, but please do check out my website at EarthPulse.com and support the InfoWars store.
[03:09:21.939 --> 03:09:28.722]  When you go to my website, if you click on the products button, it'll take you on books and videos, and those are sold
[03:09:29.342 --> 03:09:31.743]  Uh, exclusively through the InfoWars store.
[03:09:31.743 --> 03:09:32.903]  So, go there.
[03:09:32.903 --> 03:09:35.044]  I mean, you'll find used ones on Amazon.
[03:09:35.044 --> 03:09:37.065]  You'll find the digital versions on Amazon.
[03:09:37.065 --> 03:09:44.867]  But if you want the hard copy, you want the real thing, and you want to support the InfoWars, and help us with what we do, uh, in support of the InfoWars, that's the way to do it.
[03:09:44.867 --> 03:09:47.608]  Go to earthfalls.com.
[03:09:47.608 --> 03:09:50.149]  Um, you can, uh, click into books and videos.
[03:09:50.149 --> 03:09:51.790]  There's a lot of free information there.
[03:09:52.410 --> 03:09:58.553]  Take the information do whatever you want with it that's out there and get it out there and in front of people that can make a difference.
[03:09:58.553 --> 03:10:13.822]  I volunteer my time every week to prepare and come to come into this broadcast with the intention of empowering you with information that you can then take and use to maybe make a difference.
[03:10:13.822 --> 03:10:16.523]  I think it all makes a difference or I wouldn't do it.
[03:10:16.523 --> 03:10:21.226]  And so I'm asking you to join with us in the info war and
[03:10:22.546 --> 03:10:29.771]  Support us in that way, you know, buy the products, support the information, and we all get to stay in this fight together.
[03:10:29.771 --> 03:10:42.358]  And, you know, talking about, you know, listening to the ads even in the break, you know, talking about what has happened with China and really the takeover of so many various aspects of policy and impact.
[03:10:42.358 --> 03:10:43.959]  And now people are afraid.
[03:10:43.959 --> 03:10:51.444]  You see these big business leaders that have millions, billions, even trillions at stake.
[03:10:52.290 --> 03:10:59.834]  You know, when you think about where China reaches in the world today and their influence, they don't want to make them mad.
[03:10:59.834 --> 03:11:04.677]  You see, they don't want to lose the business.
[03:11:04.677 --> 03:11:10.140]  But they don't care about values unless it's their bottom line.
[03:11:10.140 --> 03:11:19.945]  See, they translate it all into transactions, all into money, all into the material, all into the earthy, the fleshy, the anchored.
[03:11:21.400 --> 03:11:23.261]  You know, and that's where that is at.
[03:11:23.261 --> 03:11:29.565]  And the fear that's being pumped out is intended to dampen the West.
[03:11:29.565 --> 03:11:36.510]  Because here's the other war that they talk about in that same Chinese directory for how to waste the West, the culture war.
[03:11:37.282 --> 03:11:52.166]  And in case you haven't noticed, look at the fire and the gas poured into that fight all over every major city in the last couple hundred days as this thing has escalated and continues to.
[03:11:52.166 --> 03:11:56.788]  Because each of these events offers opportunity for bad actors.
[03:11:56.788 --> 03:11:58.748]  I've been saying it for a long time.
[03:11:58.748 --> 03:12:02.889]  You got morons walking around, abolish the police, abolish the police.
[03:12:02.889 --> 03:12:05.010]  Who are these stupid people?
[03:12:05.010 --> 03:12:05.190]  Right?
[03:12:05.851 --> 03:12:07.291]  Abolish the police?
[03:12:07.291 --> 03:12:09.152]  What are you asking for?
[03:12:09.152 --> 03:12:29.037]  Take a look in the cities where they're asking for that and you'll find out chaos, looting, craziness, billions destroyed in assets, insurance claims, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, even deaths, violence, deaths, and weirdos, you know?
[03:12:29.037 --> 03:12:30.858]  And the Chinese laugh
[03:12:31.848 --> 03:12:34.691]  All the way to the bank.
[03:12:34.691 --> 03:12:37.773]  Because they've looted us from the inside out.
[03:12:37.773 --> 03:12:41.216]  From the values to the money.
[03:12:41.216 --> 03:12:43.338]  They've managed to corrupt it all.
[03:12:43.338 --> 03:12:44.719]  And we've let them in.
[03:12:44.719 --> 03:12:55.448]  Hey, open up Pandora's box, invite every disease, every hassle, every contrarian philosophy that violates the essence of what humans are.
[03:12:55.448 --> 03:12:59.131]  You think China reflects that in their structure of governance?
[03:13:00.456 --> 03:13:02.256]  That's it, right?
[03:13:02.256 --> 03:13:10.158]  It's socialism, but they let everybody own some stuff so they can acquire some factories and some productive capacity.
[03:13:10.158 --> 03:13:24.182]  They don't mind letting people think they own some stuff because they can just take it in a snap of your fingers and they know it because they have the power, you see.
[03:13:24.182 --> 03:13:25.142]  Now let's talk about
[03:13:25.942 --> 03:13:27.603]  Power and how it plays out.
[03:13:27.603 --> 03:13:28.643]  And we've heard about this.
[03:13:28.643 --> 03:13:33.025]  I've been talking about the power of nonprofits, the freeloaders.
[03:13:33.025 --> 03:13:35.327]  And I'm saying it loud and clear.
[03:13:35.327 --> 03:13:43.711]  Freeloaders accepting religion that government has no place in, and they've managed to hold that front.
[03:13:43.711 --> 03:13:45.452]  A bit.
[03:13:45.452 --> 03:13:49.754]  You see it eroding when they open churches for voting, but not for worship.
[03:13:49.754 --> 03:13:51.755]  It's crazy, right?
[03:13:51.755 --> 03:13:54.356]  And we heard about that in the last hour in the last weeks.
[03:13:55.643 --> 03:14:05.993]  You know, the whole thing is getting flipped upside down with new narratives, new words and new BS being sold as fertilizer.
[03:14:05.993 --> 03:14:10.377]  And we need to recognize this is not fertilizer.
[03:14:10.377 --> 03:14:12.119]  This is poison.
[03:14:12.119 --> 03:14:17.624]  This is the poison pill of greed and materialism and what it gets you.
[03:14:18.371 --> 03:14:25.777]  When we're only viewed as consumers and taxpayers feeding the P&L as the balance sheet of the nation is looted.
[03:14:25.777 --> 03:14:29.260]  Let me say that loud and clear, looted.
[03:14:29.260 --> 03:14:33.483]  I'm in the primary battleground of the last loop.
[03:14:34.252 --> 03:14:37.034]  Being extracted.
[03:14:37.034 --> 03:14:40.296]  You see, because Alaska is the treasury of the nation.
[03:14:40.296 --> 03:14:41.597]  I've talked about it before.
[03:14:41.597 --> 03:14:45.940]  I'm not getting into it today because it's not the subject of the day.
[03:14:45.940 --> 03:14:52.364]  But if you don't think the Chinese have been sniffing around at Arctic doorways, you're wrong.
[03:14:52.364 --> 03:14:53.645]  They have.
[03:14:53.645 --> 03:14:55.906]  Take a look at the news.
[03:14:55.906 --> 03:14:57.667]  You know, what are they interested in?
[03:14:57.667 --> 03:15:01.930]  A feed of natural resources they can convert into stuff.
[03:15:02.679 --> 03:15:05.560]  That they can eventually use against the West.
[03:15:05.560 --> 03:15:07.040]  And they have been.
[03:15:07.040 --> 03:15:14.123]  All along, with all of our institutions, our openness invites a modern warfare environment.
[03:15:14.123 --> 03:15:14.883]  You know?
[03:15:14.883 --> 03:15:18.244]  From creating rumors, right?
[03:15:18.244 --> 03:15:23.405]  Political rumors is one of the tactics used in the war that's going on.
[03:15:23.405 --> 03:15:25.366]  Trade wars.
[03:15:25.366 --> 03:15:28.027]  Not in some symbolic way.
[03:15:28.777 --> 03:15:35.098]  But real war, like blood and guts war, only trade where you don't see the blood and guts.
[03:15:35.098 --> 03:15:43.180]  But when people are unemployed and hungry and living in the street, isn't that the same, really?
[03:15:43.180 --> 03:15:43.940]  And guess what?
[03:15:43.940 --> 03:15:45.460]  It ties up more resources.
[03:15:45.460 --> 03:15:47.420]  You know, it's like the wounded in a battlefield.
[03:15:47.420 --> 03:15:49.961]  They tie up three or four more to get them out of the battlefield.
[03:15:49.961 --> 03:15:51.321]  Better not to kill them.
[03:15:51.321 --> 03:15:53.301]  Wound a bunch of them.
[03:15:53.301 --> 03:15:55.222]  That's what they're doing to our economies.
[03:15:55.222 --> 03:15:57.422]  That's what they're doing to our people right now.
[03:15:58.132 --> 03:16:00.633]  Wound a bunch of them.
[03:16:00.633 --> 03:16:05.075]  So everyone else has to scramble around and figure out the answers.
[03:16:05.075 --> 03:16:07.456]  And that's happening right now economically.
[03:16:07.456 --> 03:16:12.959]  It's happening through the panic party of pandemic.
[03:16:12.959 --> 03:16:13.859]  Pandemic.
[03:16:14.824 --> 03:16:19.907]  As Chinese move on, producing their stuff, laughing all the way.
[03:16:19.907 --> 03:16:21.949]  They've wiped out the West.
[03:16:21.949 --> 03:16:23.850]  They've destroyed supply chains.
[03:16:23.850 --> 03:16:26.032]  They've crippled our economies.
[03:16:26.032 --> 03:16:27.873]  They've bankrupted people.
[03:16:27.873 --> 03:16:32.316]  Half the small businesses in America are gone, and a bunch of them in Europe, too.
[03:16:32.316 --> 03:16:34.377]  And they keep falling away.
[03:16:34.377 --> 03:16:38.460]  It's as if a big nuke went off in your city, but nobody saw the flash.
[03:16:39.654 --> 03:16:42.137]  And that's what just happened, folks.
[03:16:42.137 --> 03:16:52.508]  It happened all over the world in a slow motion train wreck that Alex and I and others have been talking about for a quarter of a century.
[03:16:52.508 --> 03:16:55.771]  Quoting the guys in the game.
[03:16:55.771 --> 03:16:56.212]  All right.
[03:16:56.212 --> 03:16:57.873]  Now, I've got a front row seat.
[03:16:57.873 --> 03:17:02.098]  I've had a front row seat since 1971 to say Open China, because that's when
[03:17:02.774 --> 03:17:05.476]  My life kind of started as a young adult, you know?
[03:17:05.476 --> 03:17:11.080]  This is where I began to see the world differently as I sat outside of Washington, D.C.
[03:17:11.080 --> 03:17:20.227]  in McLean, Virginia, being raised as a teenager and watching all hell break loose as the whole thing changed in 1971 and since.
[03:17:20.227 --> 03:17:22.308]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:17:22.308 --> 03:17:24.430]  We'll be right back after these important messages.
[03:17:41.192 --> 03:17:41.973]  Warning!
[03:17:41.973 --> 03:17:42.713]  Warning!
[03:17:42.713 --> 03:17:43.554]  Warning!
[03:17:43.554 --> 03:17:59.165]  There is not long to stop the complete martial law takeover, the giant third world collapse, and a new world war that is going to be triggered by the new COVID lockdown announced by globalist systems in Europe, in Asia, and now in the United States.
[03:18:00.106 --> 03:18:14.845]  Joe Biden is set to announce today that he has a new COVID task force that is calling for a national mask mandate to prove your servitude, contact tracing, forced inoculations coming, but most importantly, a new lockdown.
[03:18:15.666 --> 03:18:22.930]  That way he can say that Trump is to blame for COVID and claim that only a new lockdown will stop COVID.
[03:18:22.930 --> 03:18:28.934]  Then, of course, when that new lockdown doesn't work, those of us that didn't submit to the lockdown are going to be blamed for it.
[03:18:28.934 --> 03:18:32.516]  And that's when all the mass arrests start sometime towards the end of next year.
[03:18:32.516 --> 03:18:35.678]  This is a permanent martial law plan.
[03:18:35.678 --> 03:18:38.880]  Trump must repudiate it, expose Fauci and Gates, and the U.N.
[03:18:38.880 --> 03:18:40.541]  takeover, not play games with it.
[03:18:41.553 --> 03:18:46.015]  Two Info Wars best-selling products are now back in stock for being sold out for months.
[03:18:46.015 --> 03:18:52.178]  BioTrue Selenium from the mustard seed, essential in all electrochemical activity of the cells in the body.
[03:18:52.178 --> 03:18:54.038]  That's every human activity.
[03:18:54.038 --> 03:18:58.960]  And on top of it, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% Cucuminoid.
[03:18:58.960 --> 03:19:02.402]  Leading competitors have 3 to 5%.
[03:19:02.402 --> 03:19:07.064]  The things that turmeric does, I don't have to tell you, this is the highest quality, the strongest you're going to find.
[03:19:07.564 --> 03:19:12.550]  So, both these are amazing products, and they fund the Infowar, which is a 360 win.
[03:19:12.550 --> 03:19:22.642]  On top of it, despite the fact they're in demand, they've been sold out for months, they're both 50% off, triple Patriot points, and free shipping at InfowarStore.com.
[03:19:23.263 --> 03:19:26.425]  That's bio-true selenium from the mustard seed.
[03:19:26.425 --> 03:19:27.726]  It's amazing.
[03:19:27.726 --> 03:19:33.310]  And on top of it, we also have Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:19:33.310 --> 03:19:34.971]  This sale will not last long.
[03:19:34.971 --> 03:19:36.372]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:19:36.372 --> 03:19:39.914]  If you really need to try these products, people absolutely love them because they really, really work.
[03:19:39.914 --> 03:19:40.855]  InfoWareStore.com.
[03:19:52.301 --> 03:19:56.604]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[03:19:56.604 --> 03:20:00.087]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[03:20:00.087 --> 03:20:03.369]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[03:20:03.369 --> 03:20:06.912]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[03:20:06.912 --> 03:20:09.154]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[03:20:09.154 --> 03:20:10.555]  I suggest Band.Video.
[03:20:11.235 --> 03:20:16.698]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[03:20:16.698 --> 03:20:25.182]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[03:20:25.182 --> 03:20:33.025]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want.
[03:20:33.025 --> 03:20:34.686]  Be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[03:20:44.597 --> 03:21:01.569]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:21:01.569 --> 03:21:03.690]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:21:03.690 --> 03:21:05.611]  Because there is a war on.
[03:21:05.611 --> 03:21:07.232]  For your mind.
[03:21:07.232 --> 03:21:09.154]  With Nick Begich.
[03:21:12.200 --> 03:21:12.921]  Welcome back.
[03:21:12.921 --> 03:21:18.364]  You know, I'm looking at this book during the break, and I wanted to read a one-liner out of this.
[03:21:18.364 --> 03:21:19.364]  It fits the day.
[03:21:19.364 --> 03:21:21.846]  Now, remember, this is 20 years ago.
[03:21:21.846 --> 03:21:22.906]  Okay.
[03:21:22.906 --> 03:21:29.690]  This was written by the Chinese military for application, how they look at warfare in the 21st century.
[03:21:29.690 --> 03:21:38.535]  And they said, by analyzing the chaos in Albania not long ago, we can clearly see the role played by various types of foundation.
[03:21:39.631 --> 03:21:40.252]  We're good to go.
[03:22:04.406 --> 03:22:12.231]  That's a quote out of this Chinese book for what happened in Albania and now what's happening actually in the United States.
[03:22:12.231 --> 03:22:15.393]  That was like the test run, you know.
[03:22:15.393 --> 03:22:30.323]  Can you send in non-profits, what they call NGOs, non-governmental organizations, like the Gates Foundation, into these countries to establish a foothold and then to have an impact on government and then change them by co-option, by getting them to
[03:22:31.407 --> 03:22:45.571]  Believe a little differently at leadership level for whatever reason, bribery, corruption, whatever you're doing to feed that beast to take the power from them and then control them and manipulate them and change the outcome by controlling the media outlets.
[03:22:45.571 --> 03:22:52.674]  Now, the Chinese did this by buying the entertainment industry, by having an impact on those that want to do business in China.
[03:22:52.674 --> 03:22:55.114]  I mean, you want to be Google in China, you better comply.
[03:22:55.114 --> 03:23:00.076]  You know, you want to play the game of big info in China, you better comply.
[03:23:01.067 --> 03:23:08.713]  And that means you dampen, you tamp down your values consistently and constantly in exchange for money.
[03:23:08.713 --> 03:23:09.533]  That's what's happening.
[03:23:09.533 --> 03:23:10.874]  It's about money.
[03:23:10.874 --> 03:23:12.395]  It's about a lot of money.
[03:23:12.395 --> 03:23:14.017]  And then eventually money runs out.
[03:23:14.017 --> 03:23:15.478]  It's about power.
[03:23:15.478 --> 03:23:17.259]  And then it's just a big chess game.
[03:23:17.259 --> 03:23:25.245]  And that's the way these guys actually even refer to it as a big chess game, where all of us are just pawns in the way.
[03:23:25.245 --> 03:23:26.526]  In fact, they're less than that.
[03:23:26.526 --> 03:23:28.187]  You're not even players on the board.
[03:23:29.522 --> 03:23:31.103]  Let me say that again.
[03:23:31.103 --> 03:23:35.506]  Most of us are not even considered players on the board.
[03:23:35.506 --> 03:23:41.970]  We're the inconvenient deplorables, as Hillary used to call us.
[03:23:41.970 --> 03:23:48.274]  You know, the masses of humanity that are thought of as some swill of flesh.
[03:23:48.274 --> 03:23:49.535]  And that is not what we are.
[03:23:50.663 --> 03:24:02.268]  And I resent that kind of diminishing of what we are because it continues to strip us of the very essence of what gives us the power that we are, and they keep taking it from us.
[03:24:02.268 --> 03:24:14.474]  And it's a robbery going on on a wholesale basis to grab the hearts and minds and defeat us without ever firing a shot.
[03:24:14.474 --> 03:24:17.275]  And there's a lot of forces being used in this play.
[03:24:18.334 --> 03:24:30.086]  By those that have an interest in subduing the human spirit, in manipulating the human spirit, in controlling what we are.
[03:24:30.086 --> 03:24:38.094]  And this is the evil in it all, you see, because this strips us of what we actually are and replaces it with something synthetic.
[03:24:39.139 --> 03:24:51.084]  And we keep seeing this play out in the information war, because now these morons believe the answer is a chip in your head and a hook to your PC, right?
[03:24:51.084 --> 03:24:53.985]  What, what stupidity is this?
[03:24:53.985 --> 03:25:05.630]  Okay, and this is from limited thinking in a materialistic world that believe that that's what you need to connect people, because it misses the fact that we already are.
[03:25:05.630 --> 03:25:08.011]  And if you actually studied the science,
[03:25:09.173 --> 03:25:18.300]  That is really blending this area of consciousness with physics and quantum physics.
[03:25:18.300 --> 03:25:19.741]  It's where the meat of it is.
[03:25:19.741 --> 03:25:35.892]  It's where a lot of explanation begins to take form on how this works, this creative process works, and why we can be so potent within the universe that's created and we're a part of and connected to in a fundamental way.
[03:25:36.613 --> 03:25:46.622]  These things keep trying to break that connection from the face mask so we can no longer as easily perceive each other by covering our faces.
[03:25:46.622 --> 03:25:49.625]  What's missed in that is it's in the eyes.
[03:25:49.625 --> 03:25:55.730]  See, this is where the power flows from us as living souls.
[03:25:55.730 --> 03:25:58.552]  It's through our eyes, through our vision, through what we see.
[03:25:58.552 --> 03:25:59.954]  It's even metaphorical, right?
[03:25:59.954 --> 03:26:03.517]  It's through our vision that we can create that which is around us.
[03:26:04.210 --> 03:26:04.390]  Right?
[03:26:04.390 --> 03:26:10.012]  Because we have to see it first in our, called our mind's eye and then projected through the eye.
[03:26:10.012 --> 03:26:15.213]  So when you look into the eye of another, you look into the soul of another and then you can discern some things.
[03:26:15.213 --> 03:26:23.435]  But you can also get lost in that and forget the shell of the person in terms of how they behave in the materialistic fleshy world.
[03:26:23.435 --> 03:26:32.498]  Because within each soul, within each pure, pure soul of light that's in each of us, is choice.
[03:26:33.467 --> 03:26:45.038]  That decides how we do this, how we play this out, how we engage the world around us and the world that we cannot see around us.
[03:26:45.038 --> 03:26:47.701]  The bigger world is that which we cannot see.
[03:26:47.701 --> 03:26:50.523]  I often talk about the space around words.
[03:26:50.523 --> 03:26:51.965]  Want to know what someone's really thinking?
[03:26:53.346 --> 03:26:54.647]  You've got to get past the words.
[03:26:54.647 --> 03:26:58.930]  You've got to get deeper into the elements around those words.
[03:26:58.930 --> 03:27:07.055]  Because words, if they truly flew out of the heart of a person, they contain an incredible amount of other information that flows in and gets conveyed clearly.
[03:27:07.055 --> 03:27:08.937]  You can feel it.
[03:27:08.937 --> 03:27:12.719]  Like this conversation we're having today around the world.
[03:27:12.719 --> 03:27:15.861]  You can feel it because we're engaged together in this.
[03:27:15.861 --> 03:27:18.043]  Because we see the power in this is our unity.
[03:27:18.906 --> 03:27:33.798]  As living souls, as we begin to formulate a new view of the world that allows us to retain our power within a very, very uneasy time, a fearful time, even a worrisome time, even.
[03:27:33.798 --> 03:27:37.962]  And I would say that without I mean, there's no exaggeration in any of that.
[03:27:37.962 --> 03:27:39.763]  We all see all that.
[03:27:39.763 --> 03:27:47.770]  But this whole concept of living in a fearful state and the violent acts that come from it and just it's just a constant
[03:27:48.720 --> 03:27:53.741]  Blow of anger as you suppress the human soul.
[03:27:53.741 --> 03:27:58.302]  And that's what begins to break out and what we begin to see played out around the world.
[03:27:58.302 --> 03:28:15.525]  And what I would say is, let's get these issues addressed as quickly as we can, because I don't believe they can stand the test in the courts, the burden of proof to suppress an entire population with house arrest starting at
[03:28:16.715 --> 03:28:21.899]  15 days and all of us laughing when they announced that nine months ago.
[03:28:21.899 --> 03:28:29.343]  Here we are, you know, and they're talking years, decades, forever.
[03:28:29.343 --> 03:28:32.925]  Chips in your hand to say you're good.
[03:28:32.925 --> 03:28:35.187]  Give me a break, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:28:35.187 --> 03:28:38.089]  This is not the gateway experience we've been looking for.
[03:28:38.089 --> 03:28:40.490]  This is the one we want to avoid.
[03:28:40.490 --> 03:28:45.133]  And the reset can happen in either way because here's what I know, the power.
[03:28:46.006 --> 03:28:52.150]  One or two who come into harmony, who come into a clear perspective.
[03:28:52.150 --> 03:28:55.433]  Two or more are gathered in his name, right?
[03:28:55.433 --> 03:28:57.314]  You have the faith of a mustard seed, right?
[03:28:57.314 --> 03:29:01.737]  The greater things ye shall do also, right?
[03:29:01.737 --> 03:29:03.078]  Do you believe it?
[03:29:03.078 --> 03:29:06.440]  Or do you just parrot these words and hope they're true?
[03:29:06.440 --> 03:29:11.683]  A lot of people do, and I don't mean to diminish any of this, but I've got to challenge you on that.
[03:29:11.683 --> 03:29:13.705]  If you're one of those that hope that they're true,
[03:29:14.605 --> 03:29:17.005]  Then you're not a believer.
[03:29:17.005 --> 03:29:19.106]  You bought an illusion.
[03:29:19.106 --> 03:29:22.286]  You have no faith.
[03:29:22.286 --> 03:29:23.047]  You have to know.
[03:29:23.047 --> 03:29:24.707]  Okay?
[03:29:24.707 --> 03:29:25.287]  You don't know.
[03:29:25.287 --> 03:29:26.427]  It's okay.
[03:29:26.427 --> 03:29:26.787]  It's okay.
[03:29:26.787 --> 03:29:27.387]  Don't panic.
[03:29:27.387 --> 03:29:29.928]  Don't get worried like somehow you missed the boat.
[03:29:29.928 --> 03:29:31.808]  No, that's not the requirement.
[03:29:31.808 --> 03:29:36.789]  The requirement is to seek to know truth.
[03:29:36.789 --> 03:29:38.489]  And you find it.
[03:29:38.489 --> 03:29:39.190]  Don't give up.
[03:29:39.190 --> 03:29:40.350]  Don't sell yourself short.
[03:29:40.350 --> 03:29:41.210]  Don't warm a pew.
[03:29:42.509 --> 03:29:47.315]  Don't be a bench warmer saying, oh yeah, I believe, I believe, when you don't.
[03:29:47.315 --> 03:29:48.556]  Be honest.
[03:29:48.556 --> 03:29:49.837]  Start with yourself.
[03:29:49.837 --> 03:29:53.782]  God already knows the truth of it.
[03:29:53.782 --> 03:29:55.644]  You know, He already knows the truth of it.
[03:29:55.644 --> 03:29:57.226]  So, start with yourself.
[03:29:57.226 --> 03:29:57.987]  Be honest.
[03:29:57.987 --> 03:29:59.789]  If you don't know things, ask.
[03:30:00.552 --> 03:30:01.813]  Things get revealed.
[03:30:01.813 --> 03:30:02.274]  Ask.
[03:30:02.274 --> 03:30:03.154]  Believe it.
[03:30:03.154 --> 03:30:07.958]  Voice it with your mouth, with your words, with the vibration that comes from your soul.
[03:30:07.958 --> 03:30:10.320]  Speak out what you don't know.
[03:30:10.320 --> 03:30:10.741]  Ask.
[03:30:10.741 --> 03:30:11.702]  It shows up.
[03:30:11.702 --> 03:30:12.823]  It's the way it works.
[03:30:12.823 --> 03:30:14.744]  It's amazing when you do it.
[03:30:14.744 --> 03:30:15.805]  But know it's true.
[03:30:15.805 --> 03:30:16.626]  Take the first step.
[03:30:16.886 --> 03:30:17.807]  We're good to go.
[03:30:40.216 --> 03:30:45.580]  When President Trump said that the mainstream corporate media was the enemy of America, he really was telling the truth.
[03:30:45.580 --> 03:30:51.825]  They don't just work for the communist Chinese and the globalists and the EU and the whole Hollywood, America-hating, God-hating crew.
[03:30:51.825 --> 03:31:01.251]  They literally say that they are in control of our minds and believe that they do own us and tell us who the president is, even though that's not in law.
[03:31:01.251 --> 03:31:05.375]  And they're just gaslighting the whole public over and over again saying, Joe Biden is president-elect.
[03:31:06.283 --> 03:31:12.467]  Repeating it over and over again like a brainwashing mantra when it's up again to the state government to certify those votes.
[03:31:12.467 --> 03:31:13.707]  And those votes are being challenged.
[03:31:13.707 --> 03:31:15.348]  There's massive evidence of fraud.
[03:31:15.348 --> 03:31:18.290]  Again, this is so incredibly clear.
[03:31:18.290 --> 03:31:25.214]  Biden said, because he thought he was going to lose up front, that, oh, we're going to challenge the vote no matter what until every vote's counted.
[03:31:25.214 --> 03:31:28.236]  Well, a lot of votes haven't been counted, and there's massive fraud being discovered.
[03:31:28.976 --> 03:31:32.358]  We're going to hold the course here because Joe Biden is a communist Chinese agent.
[03:31:32.358 --> 03:31:33.039]  He's a globalist.
[03:31:33.039 --> 03:31:34.220]  He wants carbon taxes.
[03:31:34.220 --> 03:31:38.483]  He will destroy this country by design to consolidate power and take control of us.
[03:31:38.483 --> 03:31:40.084]  This is war.
[03:31:40.084 --> 03:31:41.244]  Remember Hillary Clinton?
[03:31:41.244 --> 03:31:42.165]  Remember Pelosi?
[03:31:42.165 --> 03:31:43.126]  Remember Bill Clinton?
[03:31:43.126 --> 03:31:44.547]  Remember Obama?
[03:31:44.547 --> 03:31:49.330]  All of them said, we are not going to concede if there's a red mirage.
[03:31:49.330 --> 03:31:53.253]  We believe it's going to look like Trump's going to win a landslide if they have the internal polls.
[03:31:53.253 --> 03:31:54.454]  And indeed, Trump won.
[03:31:55.214 --> 03:31:58.095]  Most of the states he won last time by an even bigger margin.
[03:31:58.095 --> 03:32:04.597]  And when he was set to win the other ones, they froze the seven states on election night.
[03:32:04.597 --> 03:32:07.158]  And then they brought in all of the reserve ballots they had.
[03:32:07.158 --> 03:32:08.058]  This is completely transparent.
[03:32:08.058 --> 03:32:11.159]  So when they say that he is president-elect, he's not.
[03:32:11.159 --> 03:32:12.099]  Trump has not conceded.
[03:32:12.099 --> 03:32:14.180]  None of the states have certified the vote.
[03:32:14.180 --> 03:32:16.381]  And now all these investigations have been opened up.
[03:32:16.381 --> 03:32:22.003]  And avalanches, mountains, oceans of election fraud has come out and already been documented.
[03:32:22.003 --> 03:32:22.603]  And in Georgia,
[03:32:23.323 --> 03:32:25.827]  Officials are on record saying we've already found fraud.
[03:32:25.827 --> 03:32:28.110]  So ladies and gentlemen, the fix is in.
[03:32:28.110 --> 03:32:32.036]  They've run bigger and bigger hoaxes every time, because the last hoax failed.
[03:32:32.036 --> 03:32:36.182]  But now, this is the mother of all hoaxes, and if they get away with this, it's the end of America.
[03:32:36.182 --> 03:32:38.345]  As we know it, we will beat Venezuela.
[03:32:38.345 --> 03:32:39.126]  Infowars.com
[03:32:41.044 --> 03:32:43.506]  America is in crisis.
[03:32:43.506 --> 03:32:48.390]  Emergency Lockdown 2 is coming under Biden.

[03:33:07.546 --> 03:33:08.487]  We're good to go.
[03:33:26.328 --> 03:33:27.628]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:33:27.628 --> 03:33:29.529]  I want to ask you to redouble your efforts to spread the word.
[03:33:29.529 --> 03:33:31.230]  I want to ask you to buy the products.
[03:33:31.230 --> 03:33:34.211]  Medforrestore.com today, because without you, we won't be on the air.
[03:33:34.211 --> 03:33:34.871]  Again, I salute you.
[03:33:34.871 --> 03:33:35.671]  Thank you all.
[03:33:35.671 --> 03:33:38.752]  The toll-free number is 888-253-3139.
[03:33:38.752 --> 03:33:40.973]  Please take action today in our emergency center.
[03:33:40.973 --> 03:33:52.497]  Look, we all know that CNN is the epitome of fake news, but there's a headline on their site today that says, there are disinformation groups and organizations saying Joe Biden is not president-elect.
[03:33:53.735 --> 03:34:05.806]  Well, on its face, he's not president-elect, because the votes have not been certified by any of the 50 states, and counting is still going on, what, in seven of the states?
[03:34:05.806 --> 03:34:09.129]  And Trump is gaining ground in all but one of them.
[03:34:09.963 --> 03:34:19.251]  And then there's also going to be recounts, audits, and all the spot checks have already shown massive fraud, but in comes the ace card, the ace of spades.
[03:34:19.251 --> 03:34:29.420]  Big tech censorship is blocking not just the President, not just members of Congress, but tens of millions of Americans from even sharing local news stations confirming the fraud.
[03:34:29.420 --> 03:34:33.064]  This is a foreign-backed, multinational takeover of the United States.
[03:34:33.064 --> 03:34:35.005]  Trump is battling a Chinese-backed,
[03:34:35.806 --> 03:34:44.182]  New World Order system bent on keeping us locked down forever in an economic war and bringing us to our knees.
[03:34:44.182 --> 03:34:46.787]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:35:00.187 --> 03:35:07.369]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Nick Vagic.
[03:35:07.369 --> 03:35:12.631]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:35:12.631 --> 03:35:16.792]  And we're going into the last segment of the hour in, you know, a couple weeks.
[03:35:18.101 --> 03:35:23.343]  And days or so after the election, still in the aftermath, sorting that mess out.
[03:35:23.343 --> 03:35:37.370]  But really, the disruption that's happening around the world right now is purposeful and is in fact the biggest war ever fought with the biggest casualties in terms of economy ever seen.
[03:35:37.370 --> 03:35:42.072]  There's not a flash of gunpowder anywhere.
[03:35:43.152 --> 03:35:49.660]  This is the wars of the 21st century and what we predicted long ago and how it would play out.
[03:35:49.660 --> 03:35:51.181]  This is it.
[03:35:51.181 --> 03:35:53.765]  No surprises here.
[03:35:53.765 --> 03:35:54.986]  The script has been written.
[03:35:54.986 --> 03:36:01.154]  You know, I want to talk about, I've been talking about a couple different segments, areas of war, but I want to talk about some of these.
[03:36:02.375 --> 03:36:03.776]  Psychological warfare.
[03:36:03.776 --> 03:36:07.018]  This is, again, one of the things pointed out in the Chinese literature.
[03:36:07.018 --> 03:36:08.318]  Smuggling warfare.
[03:36:08.318 --> 03:36:09.299]  Media warfare.
[03:36:09.299 --> 03:36:10.219]  Drug warfare.
[03:36:10.219 --> 03:36:11.240]  Network warfare.
[03:36:11.240 --> 03:36:12.600]  Technological warfare.
[03:36:12.600 --> 03:36:14.001]  Fabrication warfare.
[03:36:14.001 --> 03:36:16.102]  Resource warfare.
[03:36:16.102 --> 03:36:18.163]  Economic aid warfare.
[03:36:18.163 --> 03:36:21.825]  Culture warfare.
[03:36:21.825 --> 03:36:24.366]  International law warfare.
[03:36:24.366 --> 03:36:28.268]  Okay, this is where they use the institutions I was talking about in one of the earlier segments.
[03:36:28.268 --> 03:36:30.949]  The UN, the World Trade Organization, these other things.
[03:36:32.193 --> 03:36:36.514]  These are opportunities to set up regulations to benefit them and hurt us.
[03:36:36.514 --> 03:36:37.274]  They can cheat.
[03:36:37.274 --> 03:36:38.334]  They cheat all the time.
[03:36:38.334 --> 03:36:39.395]  There's no worries.
[03:36:39.395 --> 03:36:41.135]  Who's going to penalize the cheaters?
[03:36:41.135 --> 03:36:43.716]  They're a dictatorship for God's sake.
[03:36:43.716 --> 03:36:48.397]  They don't penalize anyone but the cheaters who don't cheat in their favor.
[03:36:48.397 --> 03:36:52.738]  Those who cheat for their own self-interest gives them an excuse to go grab all their stuff.
[03:36:53.385 --> 03:36:55.808]  And they do it all the time, and they disappear them.
[03:36:55.808 --> 03:36:58.671]  You know, they grab all their stuff, disappear the guy.
[03:36:58.671 --> 03:37:01.114]  Thank you very much for creating some wealth.
[03:37:01.114 --> 03:37:07.142]  Because communist leadership, they don't have a clue either about making money.
[03:37:07.142 --> 03:37:08.203]  They know that.
[03:37:08.203 --> 03:37:10.085]  You think the military knows how to make money?
[03:37:10.085 --> 03:37:11.527]  No, they know how to destroy stuff.
[03:37:12.153 --> 03:37:14.534]  That's your job, okay?
[03:37:14.534 --> 03:37:16.514]  But they use businesses.
[03:37:16.514 --> 03:37:17.294]  We do it, too.
[03:37:17.294 --> 03:37:20.215]  The CIA underwrites a lot of the big tech companies.
[03:37:20.215 --> 03:37:22.115]  And then they own their asses, you see?
[03:37:22.115 --> 03:37:24.095]  And then they use them against us.
[03:37:24.095 --> 03:37:31.457]  And the elected officials wander around, stamped of approval, because they're a bunch of shills in a game they're not even in control of.
[03:37:31.457 --> 03:37:38.878]  The few players that know the game are writing the scripts, and the others think they're in.
[03:37:38.878 --> 03:37:39.179]  They're not.
[03:37:42.955 --> 03:37:51.617]  There's about a thousand players in the world, about a dozen that really want to win badly enough to wipe everyone else out.
[03:37:51.617 --> 03:37:53.478]  And they're around, okay?
[03:37:53.478 --> 03:37:59.139]  Not to create more of a panic party or to feed into this, because we've got the secret weapon.
[03:37:59.139 --> 03:38:01.980]  The secret weapon.
[03:38:01.980 --> 03:38:03.901]  The truth.
[03:38:03.901 --> 03:38:06.501]  The power of the truth.
[03:38:06.501 --> 03:38:08.022]  The power of the word.
[03:38:10.560 --> 03:38:23.633]  When the word, when what you say, when the vibration of your voice carries its intention so deeply, so completely, that it couples with consciousness in a way that brings us together.
[03:38:23.633 --> 03:38:25.435]  This is what we do individually.
[03:38:25.435 --> 03:38:26.696]  We do it in our households.
[03:38:26.696 --> 03:38:28.238]  We do it with our friends.
[03:38:28.238 --> 03:38:31.481]  We do it with our families, although we may not see the fullness of it.
[03:38:31.481 --> 03:38:33.563]  It doesn't matter whether we see the fullness of it.
[03:38:34.625 --> 03:38:37.187]  Do the things you know to be right and true.
[03:38:37.187 --> 03:38:40.589]  Use your voice to express that which you know to be right and true.
[03:38:40.589 --> 03:38:43.251]  Not just think it.
[03:38:43.251 --> 03:38:44.471]  Say it.
[03:38:44.471 --> 03:38:46.212]  Not in a risk situation.
[03:38:46.212 --> 03:38:47.293]  No, don't get scared.
[03:38:47.293 --> 03:38:51.356]  If you're fearful, shut your mouth.
[03:38:51.356 --> 03:38:53.197]  Okay, you got to conquer the fear first.
[03:38:53.197 --> 03:39:02.743]  So you have the power of knowing that allows you to deliver a message with absolute confidence knowing.
[03:39:02.743 --> 03:39:03.964]  And that's the power of it.
[03:39:04.705 --> 03:39:06.026]  Everyone can see it.
[03:39:06.026 --> 03:39:08.147]  Everyone can feel that knowing.
[03:39:08.147 --> 03:39:10.389]  So stick with what you know to be right and true.
[03:39:10.389 --> 03:39:11.429]  People will feel that.
[03:39:11.429 --> 03:39:12.910]  They'll respond to that.
[03:39:12.910 --> 03:39:15.512]  We can make changes in ourselves with that.
[03:39:15.512 --> 03:39:20.254]  We can change others by helping them see that possibility within themselves.
[03:39:20.254 --> 03:39:22.796]  Not by trying to dominate, control, and change them.
[03:39:22.796 --> 03:39:24.237]  That's the other guy's plan.
[03:39:24.237 --> 03:39:25.778]  We don't have to do that.
[03:39:25.778 --> 03:39:28.299]  We have to inform and remind.
[03:39:28.299 --> 03:39:29.220]  Help people remember.
[03:39:30.074 --> 03:39:37.916]  What we are at our essence and then how to better project that through our fleshy filters and get it all screwed up.
[03:39:37.916 --> 03:39:46.577]  And we've been warned about it in a lot of different words that 2000 years ago made a lot more sense in the way the syntax, the way the words were expressed, the way they were used.
[03:39:46.577 --> 03:39:47.838]  A little tougher now.
[03:39:47.838 --> 03:39:49.238]  You got to think about a little differently.
[03:39:49.238 --> 03:39:58.480]  You know, that's what I'm trying to do here in the last hour of the week, the fourth hour of the week is to try and kind of
[03:39:59.514 --> 03:40:03.697]  Pull all these world events back in, because they are just events.
[03:40:03.697 --> 03:40:07.279]  They're just flashes at the end of the day.
[03:40:07.279 --> 03:40:11.282]  They're grains of sand on the beach of eternity.
[03:40:11.282 --> 03:40:12.163]  Let me say that again.
[03:40:12.163 --> 03:40:16.345]  They're grains of sand on the beach of eternity.
[03:40:16.345 --> 03:40:23.851]  You see, these things that we think are so vitally important, and I'm not to say that they're not, they are in this moment vitally important.
[03:40:25.936 --> 03:40:31.798]  But is it more important that our cores stay intact, we don't fall into fear?
[03:40:31.798 --> 03:40:40.081]  Because then our power stays intact as individuals, because then we can begin to move confidently within the faith that we each have.
[03:40:40.081 --> 03:40:42.441]  The faith of a mustard seed, more than enough.
[03:40:42.441 --> 03:40:44.302]  The widow's mite, more than enough.
[03:40:44.302 --> 03:40:49.864]  Bigger than the riches of Bill Gates, even.
[03:40:49.864 --> 03:40:53.865]  Okay, I said it, but you don't necessarily believe it.
[03:40:54.776 --> 03:40:57.397]  Okay, I can't illustrate it anymore for you, all right?
[03:40:57.397 --> 03:40:59.338]  I can only say this.
[03:40:59.338 --> 03:41:01.699]  Small things matter.
[03:41:01.699 --> 03:41:04.021]  The smallest of things matter.
[03:41:04.021 --> 03:41:05.281]  It's physics, actually.
[03:41:05.281 --> 03:41:07.002]  It's called the butterfly effect.
[03:41:07.002 --> 03:41:07.902]  Look it up.
[03:41:07.902 --> 03:41:12.185]  And what it was, was a very small change in one part of the world.
[03:41:12.185 --> 03:41:19.808]  The flapping of a butterfly's wings in the right place in the right moment can create a hurricane on the other side of the planet.
[03:41:19.808 --> 03:41:21.989]  It's a law of physics.
[03:41:21.989 --> 03:41:23.270]  Be that butterfly.
[03:41:24.850 --> 03:41:27.732]  Be those flapping wings.
[03:41:27.732 --> 03:41:29.813]  Recognize there's power in that.
[03:41:29.813 --> 03:41:31.614]  There's no limit in that.
[03:41:31.614 --> 03:41:36.776]  There's unlimited power in the choices that we each get to make.
[03:41:36.776 --> 03:41:38.697]  We get to flap our wings.
[03:41:38.697 --> 03:41:42.699]  When you do it with intention, hurricanes happen on the other side of the world.
[03:41:42.699 --> 03:41:43.840]  It's the power of faith.
[03:41:43.840 --> 03:41:48.602]  It's the power of prayer when you combine all of what you know to be right and true.
[03:41:48.602 --> 03:41:50.483]  It's how the world changes.
[03:41:50.483 --> 03:41:51.984]  It's how you reclaim your power.
[03:41:51.984 --> 03:41:53.705]  How you change the very essence.
[03:41:55.154 --> 03:42:05.480]  of who you are and begin to project differently in the world, take your power back, begin to affect those things around you in a way that is constructive, not destructive.
[03:42:05.480 --> 03:42:06.801]  You begin to build.
[03:42:06.801 --> 03:42:10.162]  There's millions of others doing the same.
[03:42:10.162 --> 03:42:14.705]  Know that to be right and true because you know it is right and true.
[03:42:14.705 --> 03:42:18.387]  Millions are doing the same.
[03:42:18.387 --> 03:42:19.728]  Are you doing the best you can?
[03:42:19.728 --> 03:42:21.709]  Are you making your best effort?
[03:42:22.566 --> 03:42:27.309]  Are you beating yourself up unnecessarily within that?
[03:42:27.309 --> 03:42:29.430]  Okay, I'll say this in real strong words.
[03:42:29.430 --> 03:42:41.998]  If you're one of those people that's highly critical of your own performance, which most people are, if they're A-type personalities, really critical of your own performance all the time, I would say this.
[03:42:41.998 --> 03:42:44.700]  Don't take that too far.
[03:42:44.700 --> 03:42:47.442]  Be as forgiving of yourself as God is.
[03:42:47.442 --> 03:42:50.504]  How about that one?
[03:42:50.504 --> 03:42:50.724]  Whoa!
[03:42:51.676 --> 03:42:52.417]  How about this?
[03:42:52.417 --> 03:42:58.921]  If you're creating the image and likeness of God, then to be self-condemning without doing something about it?
[03:42:58.921 --> 03:43:04.785]  To condemn the highest creation of all, you, your living soul, all the time?
[03:43:04.785 --> 03:43:06.226]  What is that about?
[03:43:06.226 --> 03:43:07.947]  What does that represent?
[03:43:07.947 --> 03:43:13.671]  For me, that's blasphemy against the highest creation of all.
[03:43:13.671 --> 03:43:17.173]  To be self-critical is important, as we know our flaws better than anyone.
[03:43:17.774 --> 03:43:25.016]  To make changes, to make choices that alter our course, that's where the liberty happens.
[03:43:25.016 --> 03:43:27.357]  That's where the power is found again.
[03:43:27.357 --> 03:43:39.741]  When we begin to take steps in a direction that changes us, that changes those around us, and that builds something, that's when consciousness comes together and God works through us.
[03:43:39.741 --> 03:43:45.463]  In the calm of the center of the storm, as I've said it before, to be in the middle of it.
[03:43:46.184 --> 03:43:59.772]  To see it all clearly around you, but to stay calm in the middle of that storm so that your power is held and amplified by being available, right?
[03:43:59.772 --> 03:44:03.134]  If you're depressed, fearful, worried,
[03:44:03.717 --> 03:44:06.361]  You're not available for creative work.
[03:44:06.361 --> 03:44:08.143]  You're in survival mode.
[03:44:08.143 --> 03:44:10.406]  You're operating from the reptilian brain.
[03:44:10.406 --> 03:44:12.228]  The adrenals are kicked in.
[03:44:12.228 --> 03:44:15.112]  You're burning out your body, your mind, and your soul.
[03:44:15.112 --> 03:44:16.354]  Don't get lost in that.
[03:44:16.354 --> 03:44:18.677]  We all do, from time to time, get lost in that.
[03:44:20.974 --> 03:44:23.016]  Find your center again.
[03:44:23.016 --> 03:44:24.878]  Pray for the peace of it again.
[03:44:24.878 --> 03:44:29.923]  Find the way to assert your own individual power in the world to change the world.
[03:44:29.923 --> 03:44:35.729]  Don't let these guys, the Chinese, and their ideas of unrestricted warfare.
[03:44:35.729 --> 03:44:42.175]  I would challenge that with unrestricted consciousness, with an unrestricted living soul.
[03:44:42.873 --> 03:44:52.336]  With an unrestricted awareness of what you are, remembering who we are, and then beginning to act on what we believe to be right and true, and the world will change.
[03:44:52.336 --> 03:44:55.137]  And the Chaicoms don't have that.
[03:44:55.137 --> 03:44:55.517]  You see?
[03:44:55.517 --> 03:45:00.298]  They don't have the essence of it, the purity in it.
[03:45:00.298 --> 03:45:06.940]  Because God expresses himself in lots of different ways, and one of those is, God is love.
[03:45:06.940 --> 03:45:09.661]  And within that is the power of change.
[03:45:09.661 --> 03:45:11.742]  Individually, collectively,
[03:45:12.483 --> 03:45:12.984]  We'll be right back.
