[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:00.225]  We're good.
[00:00:29.693 --> 00:00:33.656]  It was eight months ago that I began to start each day's broadcast with air raid sirens.
[00:00:35.717 --> 00:00:37.998]  Because that's where we are.
[00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:42.641]  We are under military, cultural, economic, spiritual attack.
[00:00:44.182 --> 00:00:45.663]  This is the Globalist Takeover.
[00:00:45.683 --> 00:00:49.486]  The headline of the live show today says it all.
[00:00:51.287 --> 00:00:59.012]  The Democrats are instituting permanent martial law and a civilization-ending event.
[00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.611]  Civilization will be ended for the general public.
[00:01:03.732 --> 00:01:18.499]  We will live in a post-industrial, post-agrarian, hunter-gatherer system, just like you see in the Hunger Games, where there is only one powerful megacity with high-tech science and medicine.
[00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:20.640]  Everywhere else is rotting, falling buildings.
[00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:25.063]  Ninety-plus percent of the population is dead from starvation and war.
[00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.960]  And you have U.N.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.083]  peacekeepers that land and routinely execute locals who don't submit properly.
[00:01:33.804 --> 00:01:35.525]  This is all preconditioning.
[00:01:38.007 --> 00:01:41.569]  Ted Turner, Prince Philip, Prince Charles have all said it's their plan.
[00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:43.530]  Bill Gates has said it's his plan.
[00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.533]  Bill Gates' father headed up what is now known as the Good Club.
[00:01:50.703 --> 00:01:53.064]  of the Astors and the Rockefellers and the rest of them.
[00:01:53.965 --> 00:02:07.252]  I showed you a educational cartoon produced by the UN, the Rockefeller Foundation, in 2011, where robots tell you everything to do.
[00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:09.173]  The population's been reduced by 90%.
[00:02:09.494 --> 00:02:13.216]  You don't have cars and you don't get meat.
[00:02:15.717 --> 00:02:18.539]  And the state raises your children and tells them what they're going to be.
[00:02:19.585 --> 00:02:23.148]  Those that don't submit live in starvation, concentration camp ghettos.
[00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.133]  This was not the Rockefeller Foundation producing something.
[00:02:29.514 --> 00:02:30.254]  It's dystopic.
[00:02:30.315 --> 00:02:39.563]  This is a sweet liberal woman who's a doctor helping carry all this out and she talks about how much fun it is and how good it is.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.922]  So, here's a little secret.
[00:02:45.462 --> 00:02:52.849]  All these leftists that are getting two, three degrees in psychology and the rest of it, they think they're going to have a job in this.
[00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.629]  You're not.
[00:02:54.951 --> 00:02:56.972]  You're going to get poisoned and you're going to die too.
[00:02:58.374 --> 00:02:59.675]  And you're rat-like children are.
[00:03:00.315 --> 00:03:01.356]  They come from you, rats.
[00:03:03.358 --> 00:03:07.482]  So, anybody lying to themselves that they're going to escape this is a fool.
[00:03:11.064 --> 00:03:13.425]  So people keep asking how the hell I knew all this would happen.
[00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:14.225]  I just showed you.
[00:03:14.305 --> 00:03:23.529]  They write textbooks, they write white papers, they produce films, and they have been telling elementary students for 20 years you're going to take brain chips.
[00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.551]  And now Klaus Schwab comes out and says you will take brain chips.
[00:03:30.672 --> 00:03:33.553]  He says you're going to have to be brain scanned and have a chip to be able to travel.
[00:03:34.013 --> 00:03:37.655]  First they're going to make you take inoculations and these new things they call inoculations that are
[00:03:38.672 --> 00:03:40.934]  Engineered viruses that actually change your DNA.
[00:03:41.034 --> 00:03:47.138]  I mean, this is just leap forward into the center of a nightmare science fiction movie like that.
[00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.022]  And they've been preparing for it the entire time.
[00:03:54.604 --> 00:03:55.244]  And now we're here.
[00:03:56.865 --> 00:04:00.088]  They are producing the destabilization.
[00:04:00.128 --> 00:04:02.149]  They know exactly how they do it.
[00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.712]  They are bringing you into a dystopia.
[00:04:06.505 --> 00:04:11.429]  And now you're locked in your house and not allowed to leave your house except when you're told you can, but it's okay.
[00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:16.513]  You don't get to see your sister anymore or travel, but you get to talk to her over a hologram.
[00:04:18.915 --> 00:04:25.240]  And of course, the system gets to monitor and record everything you ever say and ever do in the machine learning system.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.642]  You're being plugged into a pod.
[00:04:28.843 --> 00:04:31.766]  As I told you years ago, it was declassified.
[00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:33.167]  I wrote about it in my book, The Sin of Tyranny.
[00:04:35.984 --> 00:04:52.233]  The Pentagon had a secret report in the 70s, which they classified in 2000, of how they would end war by having us born in tanks and put in tanks, that would then power as batteries the machines, and that we would live in a matrix system, and then made a movie out of it.
[00:04:52.813 --> 00:04:56.835]  So you're now being inserted into your house, your VR, they're preparing the pods.
[00:05:02.398 --> 00:05:05.360]  Remember, don't worry, be happy, everything's gonna be alright.
[00:05:06.463 --> 00:05:09.865]  Over and over, you know, we were told, let the technocracy spy on you.
[00:05:09.905 --> 00:05:12.286]  Let big tech control what you do.
[00:05:12.686 --> 00:05:14.427]  They will never abuse their power.
[00:05:14.467 --> 00:05:15.387]  They will never hurt you.
[00:05:16.268 --> 00:05:24.952]  And just as soon as they got their global AI grid in, they used Communist China as the beta test to sell the world on a dystopic martial law lockdown.
[00:05:25.572 --> 00:05:28.573]  When it all started eight, nine months ago, I told you it's never going to end.
[00:05:28.933 --> 00:05:30.254]  They're never going to turn loose this power.
[00:05:30.274 --> 00:05:33.776]  They're going to make you have internal passports on your phones.
[00:05:34.736 --> 00:05:36.677]  To leave your house, to have a job, to travel.
[00:05:37.117 --> 00:05:41.339]  They're gonna add more and more restrictions on of how you get that travel pass.
[00:05:41.439 --> 00:05:43.340]  Remember The Running Man?
[00:05:43.881 --> 00:05:47.802]  Schwarzenegger movie in the mid-80s written by Stephen King about a future police state?
[00:05:48.323 --> 00:05:50.284]  Watch that movie and then compare it to today.
[00:05:50.824 --> 00:05:59.128]  We are in the absolute brand, the absolute mold of a classic authoritarian dystopic nightmare.
[00:05:59.148 --> 00:06:00.969]  We've got to reject this now before it's cemented.
[00:06:12.571 --> 00:06:16.453]  When I grow up, I want a pro-human future and to defeat the technocrats.
[00:06:16.493 --> 00:06:23.177]  And we're already in position to do it, thanks to our mission and God's light shining through us.
[00:06:23.257 --> 00:06:23.657]  Initiate.
[00:06:24.117 --> 00:06:24.678]  Operation.
[00:06:24.918 --> 00:06:30.561]  Destroy the New World Order.
[00:06:30.601 --> 00:06:36.564]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center, in the heart of the resistance.
[00:06:36.964 --> 00:06:39.026]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[00:06:41.761 --> 00:06:59.529]  You know, when I read that Department of Defense report that the Federation of American Scientists released back in 2000, had been classified since the late 1970s, that described the Carnegie Endowment, the Rockefeller Endowment, in the 40s, saying, we want a system that ends war.
[00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:06.472]  Well, you have to end men and end testosterone, they believed, to end war.
[00:07:06.772 --> 00:07:09.774]  And then finally, you want to just take humans out of their environment entirely,
[00:07:11.277 --> 00:07:22.923]  And one proposal would have us to live in tanks from birth, plugged into virtual reality, and then our own body heat would then give power to the system and be symbiotic with the machines.
[00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:28.065]  I mean, you don't think the Wachowski brothers came up with that movie on their own, do you?
[00:07:28.085 --> 00:07:28.525]  The Matrix.
[00:07:30.126 --> 00:07:32.267]  Or the Wachowski ladies.
[00:07:32.347 --> 00:07:33.968]  They're transcending right now.
[00:07:35.729 --> 00:07:40.331]  And the first sacrament is to remove your genitals when you're in Heaven's Gate cult, or in any of the cults.
[00:07:41.203 --> 00:07:44.165]  Remember in the old days when crazy UFO cults cut their testicles off?
[00:07:44.866 --> 00:07:49.290]  Now it's the thing you do if your son's seven and he's cool, he transcends.
[00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.794]  And then you can't criticize someone becoming trans because they're gonna really be transcending their bodies.
[00:07:55.655 --> 00:08:01.499]  You'll believe you've become AI, it'll copy your voice, you can even have an avatar body, but it won't be you.
[00:08:05.523 --> 00:08:10.627]  So that's what this is, and we're being forced into the final revolution
[00:08:13.117 --> 00:08:16.139]  That is coming out of our bodies and going into a digital cage.
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:19.921]  And I'm not the one that came up with these plans.
[00:08:20.401 --> 00:08:21.081]  They sound insane.
[00:08:21.462 --> 00:08:22.682]  I keep hammering the same thing.
[00:08:22.702 --> 00:08:41.793]  I've got hundreds of articles, dozens of incredible clips, and I'll get to it, but on this November 25th transmission, it's important to just pull back and understand where we really are.
[00:08:42.984 --> 00:08:43.905]  And not a lot of ourselves.
[00:08:46.847 --> 00:08:48.328]  Democrats declared martial law.
[00:08:48.408 --> 00:08:48.868]  Lockdown 2.
[00:08:49.188 --> 00:08:51.770]  It'll be permanent.
[00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:53.992]  Civilization ending event.
[00:08:55.013 --> 00:08:59.156]  And that's what Ted Turner and Bill Gates and all of them say they're doing.
[00:08:59.796 --> 00:09:04.720]  And that's why eight months ago on Fareed Zakaria on CNN, Bill Gates said, it's never ending.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.361]  Things never go back to normal.
[00:09:06.941 --> 00:09:08.302]  You never stop wearing the mask.
[00:09:09.663 --> 00:09:11.885]  And they're announcing the forced inoculations and all of it coming.
[00:09:13.902 --> 00:09:15.323]  And of course there's mass censorship.
[00:09:15.343 --> 00:09:16.423]  And of course it's going to get worse.
[00:09:16.463 --> 00:09:18.585]  And of course it's AI watching you in live time.
[00:09:18.885 --> 00:09:19.665]  That's the whole point.
[00:09:23.087 --> 00:09:27.089]  They believe they're mopping up the 7 plus billion people that are hurting the Earth.
[00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:28.950]  They're the globalists.
[00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:29.591]  They're in charge.
[00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:31.832]  And they're not going to save the Earth.
[00:09:31.852 --> 00:09:33.573]  On the contrary, they're going to override it.
[00:09:35.014 --> 00:09:35.994]  Because that's their religion.
[00:09:41.157 --> 00:09:42.358]  Let me go ahead and read you these headlines.
[00:09:43.769 --> 00:09:44.509]  In the time together.
[00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.631]  Macron starts talking third wave of COVID.
[00:09:49.912 --> 00:09:51.913]  Says they can never reopen again.
[00:09:52.613 --> 00:09:53.173]  Of course you can't.
[00:09:54.874 --> 00:10:00.116]  Oh, there's record, record cases as they test everyone and now you gotta test to get on a plane, test to go to a restaurant.
[00:10:00.336 --> 00:10:03.158]  All these little computer tests, people sticking things up your nose.
[00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:05.539]  And they just set the test so high?
[00:10:06.219 --> 00:10:07.960]  Ever had a viral infection or bacterial?
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.761]  You are now taken away
[00:10:12.657 --> 00:10:16.761]  The police come to a COVID center, so you're used to seeing people being taken away.
[00:10:18.702 --> 00:10:23.227]  That's not early martial law, that's latter stage martial law.
[00:10:24.228 --> 00:10:38.701]  Locked in your houses, controlled, digital passports, medical tyranny, experimental, Geneva Convention, Nuremberg Code violating, vaccines they admit are killing people in the trials, and some trials making everyone sick, but it's okay, you will take it.
[00:10:39.414 --> 00:10:48.157]  We're gonna come and take you and all the AmeriCorps and all the ObamaCorps people they hired are under the Clinton Global Initiative now and whether it's Australia or the U.S., it's the Clintons.
[00:10:48.497 --> 00:10:59.380]  And they're, you know, they've got two college degrees and they're social workers and they're coming to your right-wing house and they've got a dossier on you and you've got kids in there and they're gonna protect those kids and they're gonna take you to a COVID center!
[00:11:00.353 --> 00:11:04.116]  Secret COVID centers in the U.S., in Canada, in Europe.
[00:11:04.817 --> 00:11:07.278]  And, oh, people have been taken to them.
[00:11:07.499 --> 00:11:13.063]  And it's reported that you're five times more likely in the Canadian provinces if you're taken to the secret center to die.
[00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:14.044]  They don't know why.
[00:11:14.064 --> 00:11:18.027]  Kind of like certain hospitals in New York where almost all the death of COVID is happening.
[00:11:18.347 --> 00:11:20.389]  Because they grab homeless people as the test.
[00:11:20.849 --> 00:11:23.351]  And they put a tube down their throat and blow their lungs out.
[00:11:23.391 --> 00:11:24.412]  They're murdering.
[00:11:24.432 --> 00:11:26.353]  And they're going to murder you.
[00:11:26.754 --> 00:11:27.955]  Because they're killers.
[00:11:31.021 --> 00:11:33.503]  Yes, it's a dystopic, but they've got the whole cover for it.
[00:11:34.824 --> 00:11:36.565]  And any doctors that speak out and say it's happening?
[00:11:36.625 --> 00:11:37.406]  Oh, they get banned.
[00:11:38.026 --> 00:11:38.066]  Oh!
[00:11:38.787 --> 00:11:41.429]  You can't have the former chief scientist of Pfizer come out.
[00:11:41.929 --> 00:11:43.630]  Oh, you can't have the heads of hospitals come out.
[00:11:43.911 --> 00:11:48.314]  You can't have them come out and say they're killing people, that you shouldn't be putting them on the breathing machines.
[00:11:48.554 --> 00:11:49.335]  You're coughing!
[00:11:49.475 --> 00:11:50.215]  They put you on one.
[00:11:50.475 --> 00:11:50.996]  Oh, sorry.
[00:11:51.136 --> 00:11:51.836]  Oh, you're gonna resist?
[00:11:53.097 --> 00:11:53.698]  You're tied up?
[00:11:54.238 --> 00:11:56.600]  And they... They're gonna get $50,000 when they kill your ass.
[00:12:01.269 --> 00:12:05.572]  And now they've got the court of executioners instead of having a guillotine in this town square.
[00:12:08.874 --> 00:12:13.856]  They've got our little friends.
[00:12:14.457 --> 00:12:15.217]  Let me continue.
[00:12:17.078 --> 00:12:17.979]  It's a great reset.
[00:12:17.999 --> 00:12:18.959]  It's a way to save the earth.
[00:12:19.940 --> 00:12:23.202]  Macron starts talking third wave of COVID.
[00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:29.061]  World sees record jump of COVID deaths as cases near 60 million mark.
[00:12:29.261 --> 00:12:29.361]  Oh!
[00:12:29.381 --> 00:12:35.524]  Because now that they've got 60 million cases, and if any of them die, including in car wrecks or the flu, they count it as that.
[00:12:36.744 --> 00:12:37.765]  They admit it's all fraud.
[00:12:38.445 --> 00:12:41.746]  New York City will have COVID checkpoints at key bridges and crossings.
[00:12:41.786 --> 00:12:42.147]  Bloomberg.
[00:12:42.447 --> 00:12:44.828]  And if they say you have a fever, you'll be taken away.
[00:12:45.988 --> 00:12:52.411]  de Blasio unleashes COVID checkpoints to catch and find New York City travelers who violate holiday quarantine.
[00:12:53.831 --> 00:12:56.673]  New York City sets up quarantine checkpoints to stop COVID-19 spread.
[00:12:57.214 --> 00:12:59.595]  No, to exercise martial law and control.
[00:12:59.615 --> 00:13:03.558]  Notice China's open for business, but we're not.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:07.501]  See, we can only buy from China now.
[00:13:07.541 --> 00:13:10.384]  None of our factories and businesses can be open because I haven't gotten to that yet.
[00:13:10.844 --> 00:13:16.048]  And now, blue cities, blue states, they're saying, if you have any cases at your factory, you're ordered shut down.
[00:13:19.867 --> 00:13:21.167]  Everybody wants to have it.
[00:13:21.227 --> 00:13:22.388]  It's kind of cool to have it.
[00:13:22.428 --> 00:13:23.548]  You go in and you get attention.
[00:13:23.568 --> 00:13:24.648]  You get a couple weeks off.
[00:13:25.308 --> 00:13:41.033]  But then your whole country's gone forever because you got into being enrolled and how you're dirty and how you're dangerous and how you're scary and how you're bad but how you're a hero and you made it through it and now, oh sorry, an employee headed a whole grocery store so now that that grocery store has to close.
[00:13:41.313 --> 00:13:43.333]  Oh, they don't say bring in more workers.
[00:13:43.393 --> 00:13:43.913]  No, no, no.
[00:13:44.394 --> 00:13:45.434]  It's just closed.
[00:13:49.534 --> 00:13:55.078]  The new normal, students at SUNY must test negative for COVID to leave for Thanksgiving.
[00:13:55.278 --> 00:13:56.419]  That's called being a prisoner.
[00:13:56.459 --> 00:13:58.781]  That's up on InfoWars.com from National File.
[00:14:00.422 --> 00:14:09.909]  And all the big airlines are announcing, oh, Korean Air and Qantas, oh, you're gonna have to have whatever the new vaccine is that the UN says and Bill Gates says.
[00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:11.971]  Bill Gates says that's five a year of COVID alone.
[00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:14.332]  Of a special new one is mRNA.
[00:14:15.876 --> 00:14:18.958]  He says you won't be able to travel till you take my vaccine.
[00:14:19.298 --> 00:14:22.079]  That's not creepy at all and weird little piggy face.
[00:14:22.099 --> 00:14:28.162]  I mean, if I was casting somebody to play a Nazi, like in a science fiction Nazi movie, it'd be the CEO of Qantas.
[00:14:28.222 --> 00:14:31.384]  I mean, sorry, he literally just needs round little spectacles.
[00:14:31.424 --> 00:14:32.545]  He could be in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
[00:14:33.185 --> 00:14:35.106]  I mean, you can't make it up.
[00:14:38.628 --> 00:14:38.768]  Yeah.
[00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:45.615]  Journalist live tweets herself harassing small businesses for opening restaurant in defiance of lockdown.
[00:14:45.655 --> 00:14:47.316]  That's what the mainstream journalists are now is.
[00:14:48.677 --> 00:14:53.862]  They're censors and they're tattles and they call the police and they write articles about you and they say who you are.
[00:14:54.983 --> 00:14:56.064]  That's what they're trained in.
[00:14:56.144 --> 00:14:57.405]  Every authoritarian art.
[00:14:58.783 --> 00:15:10.813]  YouTube suspends pro-Trump news network OAN, completely demonetizes channel for having medical doctors on talking about, don't be afraid of COVID, here's what cures it, with 99% surety.
[00:15:11.134 --> 00:15:18.260]  Oh, you can't talk about all the different known drugs and steroids and one treatment of this or one treatment, no, no, no, no, there's no treatment.
[00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:22.824]  Go to a special hospital, that's why there's only a few hospitals in every state where almost all the deaths happen.
[00:15:23.484 --> 00:15:27.006]  Go to a regular hospital, steal good people who aren't part of the compartmentalized cult.
[00:15:27.466 --> 00:15:28.626]  They'll give you the steroids.
[00:15:28.906 --> 00:15:30.427]  They'll give you the zinc.
[00:15:31.367 --> 00:15:33.308]  Oh, you're fine if they catch it early.
[00:15:33.528 --> 00:15:34.969]  But see, you're not allowed to have hope.
[00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:37.370]  So, oh yeah, they're canceled now.
[00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.311]  The Democrats have declared martial law, but it's all over the world.
[00:15:41.252 --> 00:15:45.814]  And again, closing the grocery stores, ladies and gentlemen, when we come back.
[00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:50.525]  Oh my gosh, New Mexico governor shuts down grocery stores for two weeks.
[00:15:51.046 --> 00:15:52.628]  That's right, you don't need food!
[00:16:01.826 --> 00:16:06.510]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations, and different mixes of the two.
[00:16:06.991 --> 00:16:09.393]  One is born of renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[00:16:10.034 --> 00:16:18.422]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos, and a culture, and ingenuity, and art, and skill, and strength.
[00:16:19.122 --> 00:16:24.487]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls, with a tiny elite above it.
[00:16:25.468 --> 00:16:33.012]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[00:16:33.553 --> 00:16:36.754]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[00:16:37.174 --> 00:16:41.437]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[00:16:41.997 --> 00:16:43.698]  A global permanent lockdown is here.
[00:16:43.718 --> 00:16:46.619]  It is already causing millions and millions to starve to death.
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:48.740]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[00:16:49.321 --> 00:16:56.924]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[00:16:57.164 --> 00:16:57.845]  That's the facts.
[00:16:57.965 --> 00:16:59.926]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[00:17:00.626 --> 00:17:06.049]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made.
[00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:06.949]  Alpha Power.
[00:17:07.389 --> 00:17:10.591]  As you age, your body can lose testosterone over time.

[00:17:47.915 --> 00:17:51.678]  Show the world what a true alpha male looks like today with Alpha Power.
[00:17:51.979 --> 00:17:54.481]  Head to infowarsstore.com today.
[00:18:01.969 --> 00:18:02.970]  It really is simple.
[00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:04.811]  The left are into being deviant.
[00:18:04.831 --> 00:18:06.573]  And I don't mean sexually deviant.
[00:18:06.613 --> 00:18:08.054]  That goes the territory.
[00:18:08.474 --> 00:18:15.039]  I'm talking about deviant against their ancestors, deviant against their own species, deviant against the order of nature.
[00:18:15.759 --> 00:18:20.403]  Even though that deviance is destructive and poisonous, they still do it because they want to play God.
[00:18:20.523 --> 00:18:22.644]  Everything they touch, they destroy.
[00:18:22.705 --> 00:18:27.008]  Their sacrament is aborting babies and then using their body parts.
[00:18:27.448 --> 00:18:30.951]  Their religion is not taking care of the old, but euthanizing them.
[00:18:31.471 --> 00:18:45.363]  Their whole system is designed for the UN to keep third world countries in serious poverty and poor, ballooning populations, then watching all that new fruit die on the vine, to continually reproduce the same nightmares over and over and over again.
[00:18:45.403 --> 00:18:47.184]  They truly are the children of Satan.
[00:18:47.204 --> 00:18:48.145]  They are the children of the devil.
[00:18:48.165 --> 00:18:54.911]  And if you look at the slaves that served them, Biden and Kamala Harris, it really is manifest that being a slave of Satan is not profitable.
[00:18:55.431 --> 00:18:56.672]  Sin is not profitable.
[00:18:57.073 --> 00:18:59.295]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the InfoWar.
[00:19:00.697 --> 00:19:06.679]  The scientists at Infowars Life have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support.
[00:19:07.059 --> 00:19:09.680]  Discover the power of ancient medicine with Bades.
[00:19:10.281 --> 00:19:13.722]  Bades contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[00:19:13.982 --> 00:19:18.243]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[00:19:18.684 --> 00:19:21.925]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[00:19:22.845 --> 00:19:33.075]  Our pure turmeric extract plus piperine from Black Pepper makes for optimal absorption to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system, and so much more.
[00:19:33.836 --> 00:19:42.384]  Regular turmeric root from the store only contains 1-5% of Actum ingredients, but our turmeric root extract contains over 95% of the Actum ingredients.
[00:19:44.005 --> 00:19:52.552]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm, and thyme to work synergistically for full body support.

[00:20:02.839 --> 00:20:08.744]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:20:12.318 --> 00:20:15.136]  Let's do it.
[00:20:45.908 --> 00:20:46.328]  Alright!
[00:20:48.729 --> 00:20:51.570]  You think the globalists just want to abort babies and euthanize old people?
[00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:53.630]  They want everybody.
[00:20:57.172 --> 00:21:11.176]  And as soon as you realize everything they do is about war, destruction, collapsing, shipping in fentanyl, brainwashing children, devil worshipping, pedophilia, they are a weapon system to bring down civilization.
[00:21:12.981 --> 00:21:17.643]  And their average minion's given a cover story of why they do it, and it's so stupid they carry it out.
[00:21:18.724 --> 00:21:27.309]  Well, this hospital's policy is, if we see a homeless person coughing, we bring them in and we put an intubation tube in their lungs and we turn it up.
[00:21:27.349 --> 00:21:28.129]  We don't know why.
[00:21:28.789 --> 00:21:31.751]  It says turn it up twice as high as any other medical journal says.
[00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:37.214]  We just do it, and it's the policy from the UN, and so we're allowed to kill people because it's a policy.
[00:21:39.190 --> 00:21:53.417]  And then remember, half the people that died in the United States were in nursing homes, where they shipped sick people in, who were adults, and those were asymptomatic, into a crowd of people with no sunlight, eating crappy nursing home food.
[00:21:54.938 --> 00:21:58.440]  Because they needed the death numbers, and the nursing homes were more than happy.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.741]  Remember, oh, but oh, your parents can't come.
[00:22:02.349 --> 00:22:05.730]  And your kids can't come, or your neighbors can't come, or your old friends can't come.
[00:22:06.390 --> 00:22:09.552]  Nobody can come see you in the nursing home because you might have COVID.
[00:22:10.092 --> 00:22:13.493]  But if someone does have it, then we put them in the same room with them.
[00:22:15.814 --> 00:22:21.896]  That's where you saw the weird gang member stuff of, you know, the 20-year-old black guy beating up old white people.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.001]  It's because that guy, quote, had COVID.
[00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:31.626]  And really, it turned out his family just wanted to stick him in there and make money, because you get a bunch of extra welfare when you got it.
[00:22:32.086 --> 00:22:33.928]  You see, that's priming the pump.
[00:22:33.948 --> 00:22:35.589]  I mean, it's like a celebrity thing.
[00:22:35.930 --> 00:22:37.191]  Oh, I've got COVID.
[00:22:37.431 --> 00:22:38.772]  Oh, a congressman got it.
[00:22:38.972 --> 00:22:40.013]  He's quarantining.
[00:22:40.233 --> 00:22:41.775]  Oh, you're virtue signaling.
[00:22:42.015 --> 00:22:43.176]  You're wearing your mask.
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:55.982]  What you're really doing is signing on to the total, diabolical, world government, world ID takeover that Xi Jinping is running and that Xi Jinping has now announced with the airlines.
[00:22:58.783 --> 00:23:07.105]  There's an article out that a lot of the big tech heads and their minions are all getting golden passports so they can flee the United States.
[00:23:09.025 --> 00:23:11.725]  They're going to put us into permanent lockdown.
[00:23:11.745 --> 00:23:13.946]  We're talking a decade, 20 years of it.
[00:23:15.182 --> 00:23:17.344]  When they're done, you'll have nothing.
[00:23:17.384 --> 00:23:18.665]  You'll be totally bankrupt.
[00:23:21.427 --> 00:23:22.568]  This is their plan.
[00:23:22.868 --> 00:23:24.890]  We've now hit the New World Order.
[00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:25.951]  It's over.
[00:23:28.033 --> 00:23:30.235]  Stop wearing the mask.
[00:23:30.655 --> 00:23:31.936]  Stop complying.
[00:23:34.158 --> 00:23:35.099]  Now the chips are down.
[00:23:35.159 --> 00:23:38.802]  What has Trump said and what has his head scientist said?
[00:23:39.222 --> 00:23:39.783]  Dr. Atlas.
[00:23:39.803 --> 00:23:41.004]  He said, rise up.
[00:23:41.829 --> 00:23:42.670]  It's a deception.
[00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:44.911]  Almost all the cases are something else.
[00:23:45.352 --> 00:23:47.693]  And the tests are 90% fake.
[00:23:47.953 --> 00:23:52.717]  Even the New York Times has to admit 90% of the tests are not it.
[00:23:55.419 --> 00:24:03.985]  They turn the PCR test and others up so high that they're false.
[00:24:05.025 --> 00:24:09.729]  In the UK, they're turning it up 45 times the recommended level.
[00:24:11.445 --> 00:24:17.646]  The test, PCR is the name they're using, isn't even designed for finding viruses, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:24:17.946 --> 00:24:19.027]  It's made up.
[00:24:19.447 --> 00:24:20.527]  It's a fraud.
[00:24:23.328 --> 00:24:27.668]  And now the SJWs are coming to your house, just like Australia, just like Europe.
[00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:32.109]  And when you don't open up, five minutes later.
[00:24:32.349 --> 00:24:34.470]  Guys, cue up the video of the German medical doctor.
[00:24:36.036 --> 00:24:39.019]  I'm reconstructing timelines.
[00:24:39.039 --> 00:24:40.860]  Basically, everything is parallel at the same time.
[00:24:58.598 --> 00:24:59.839]  There's a doctor in his loft.
[00:25:00.079 --> 00:25:00.639]  In his attic.
[00:25:00.659 --> 00:25:01.099]  Police!
[00:25:01.139 --> 00:25:02.200]  Here they come.
[00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:02.880]  Excuse me.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:03.361]  Excuse me.
[00:25:03.381 --> 00:25:04.181]  The police are here.
[00:25:28.203 --> 00:25:29.304]  The police... Yeah, I know what's going on.
[00:25:29.344 --> 00:25:29.565]  I know...
[00:25:47.765 --> 00:25:50.607]  Total violation of the Nuremberg Code.
[00:25:50.627 --> 00:25:54.670]  Total violation of the Geneva Convention.
[00:25:54.690 --> 00:25:57.012]  Violation of the UN Declaration of Human Rights.
[00:25:57.092 --> 00:26:01.735]  Article 30 says they can waive it if they want.
[00:26:17.554 --> 00:26:20.175]  And these are your trendy, liberal, social justice warrior police.
[00:26:21.516 --> 00:26:24.878]  Beating women and children with billy clubs for protesting.
[00:26:25.198 --> 00:26:28.220]  Oh, but Black Lives Matter and Antifa, they can be out and protest.
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:32.042]  Just not the German people.
[00:26:32.302 --> 00:26:36.464]  And then the cops come in and they turn off the camera.
[00:26:37.084 --> 00:26:37.965]  These people are scum.
[00:26:40.069 --> 00:26:47.091]  Oh, and there's all these articles where they want the police to arrest Trump, and they want anyone criticizing the COVID lockdowns to be arrested.
[00:26:47.111 --> 00:26:47.651]  That's in the news.
[00:26:47.691 --> 00:26:48.471]  I've got that in the stack.
[00:26:49.692 --> 00:26:52.072]  And, oh, but they don't want to defund the police.
[00:26:52.172 --> 00:26:56.213]  Oh, we shouldn't have any police, but then we need to have extra police to come arrest you for your speech.
[00:26:58.434 --> 00:27:02.635]  Oh, and the Pope says that people that are against the lockdowns are of the devil.
[00:27:04.087 --> 00:27:08.749]  When he is a communist globalist who literally says Europe shouldn't be Christian, he's not a pope.
[00:27:09.229 --> 00:27:15.232]  They've taken over every major institution and they're making their move.
[00:27:15.732 --> 00:27:16.972]  And I've got the reports right here.
[00:27:18.153 --> 00:27:23.255]  The UN was saying 36 million were on the verge of starving, several million have already died, the new numbers are in.
[00:27:24.790 --> 00:27:34.078]  They estimate 230 plus million people are on the edge of starvation, and that 100 million extra over the normal 15 million will starve to death in the next year because of COVID.
[00:27:34.158 --> 00:27:36.620]  No, because of the lockdown you put in place.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.423]  That's hundreds of times what COVID's killed, if you even believe it.
[00:27:40.983 --> 00:27:45.287]  And the left loves it, just like Apple runs the worst slave camps.
[00:27:45.847 --> 00:27:53.853]  But they have a gay man that runs it, he's skinny, he has a chicken neck, and so it's like, let him kill people, he's gay!
[00:27:54.778 --> 00:27:55.578]  My God!
[00:27:56.719 --> 00:27:57.619]  Don't you understand?
[00:27:57.639 --> 00:28:06.162]  So what if Apple's lobbying publicly to not have a law that Trump's tried to get through that companies can't operate slave camps?
[00:28:07.042 --> 00:28:08.243]  Slave camps are good.
[00:28:09.603 --> 00:28:12.084]  Keeping babies alive and selling their body parts is good.
[00:28:13.764 --> 00:28:15.625]  Arresting people for their speech is good.
[00:28:15.645 --> 00:28:18.846]  So just smile with Tim.
[00:28:21.067 --> 00:28:23.528]  He was in China three years ago at a Xi Jinping event.
[00:28:23.548 --> 00:28:24.268]  You can pull it up.
[00:28:25.464 --> 00:28:26.664]  It's a headline.
[00:28:27.224 --> 00:28:30.005]  It's speech in Beijing.
[00:28:30.845 --> 00:28:35.946]  Tim Cook says he supports Chinese censorship and supports it worldwide and thinks there should be more of it.
[00:28:36.787 --> 00:28:37.827]  What a good man.
[00:28:38.327 --> 00:28:40.127]  He's a good man.
[00:28:41.708 --> 00:28:42.828]  He's a good man.
[00:28:42.848 --> 00:28:43.788]  You're not good.
[00:28:44.068 --> 00:28:45.128]  You're right wing.
[00:28:46.669 --> 00:28:47.689]  But he's good.
[00:28:48.939 --> 00:28:50.061]  He's the good man!
[00:28:50.681 --> 00:28:51.603]  You're the bad man!
[00:28:52.424 --> 00:28:54.026]  And Joe Biden's the good man, too!
[00:28:54.426 --> 00:28:55.368]  You're bad, America!
[00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:07.675]  You know, most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the Communist Chinese and the United Nations.
[00:29:08.215 --> 00:29:18.241]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient, the worst Australian models of complete lockdowns where you can't even leave your house for months and months are being announced.
[00:29:18.722 --> 00:29:28.508]  And in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to blast men, women, and children that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator, has put them under her control.
[00:29:29.068 --> 00:29:29.428]  That's right.
[00:29:29.448 --> 00:29:31.989]  She's been rigging elections for years and years.
[00:29:32.009 --> 00:29:35.151]  And the same thing is coming here to the United States.
[00:29:35.231 --> 00:29:36.191]  This is world government.
[00:29:36.791 --> 00:29:41.113]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested.
[00:29:41.473 --> 00:29:43.494]  They're announcing that Christmas is canceled.
[00:29:43.514 --> 00:29:45.655]  This is what the communist takeover looks like.
[00:29:45.935 --> 00:29:49.837]  To bankrupt you, to take rid of all your due process, and absolutely
[00:29:50.217 --> 00:29:53.304]  Transform the world into a prison planet.
[00:29:53.324 --> 00:29:55.328]  How long have we warned you about this?
[00:29:55.568 --> 00:29:56.590]  But you can fight back.
[00:29:56.891 --> 00:29:58.534]  America is the last bastion.
[00:29:58.795 --> 00:29:59.596]  Stop submitting!
[00:30:02.005 --> 00:30:03.366]  Let's go to Meg in Oregon.
[00:30:03.386 --> 00:30:04.106]  Meg, thanks for holding.
[00:30:04.126 --> 00:30:04.586]  You're awesome.
[00:30:04.606 --> 00:30:04.947]  Go ahead.
[00:30:05.247 --> 00:30:06.327]  Yeah, hi, Alex.
[00:30:06.367 --> 00:30:11.170]  This is my first time calling, and I want to just say something that nobody's talking about.
[00:30:11.210 --> 00:30:13.572]  And I listen to a lot of conservative media.
[00:30:13.652 --> 00:30:14.812]  And I drive.
[00:30:14.952 --> 00:30:15.693]  I drive a truck.
[00:30:15.753 --> 00:30:20.495]  I transport hay for a living between northern Oregon and central California.
[00:30:20.555 --> 00:30:22.817]  And I want people to really hear me.
[00:30:22.877 --> 00:30:26.599]  The breadbasket of the world, which is that valley, is empty.
[00:30:26.759 --> 00:30:27.419]  And I see it.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.321]  My car, my rig is covered in ash.
[00:30:30.421 --> 00:30:31.762]  It's not just the fire.
[00:30:31.822 --> 00:30:32.862]  It's the ash.
[00:30:32.902 --> 00:30:33.863]  It's the smoke.
[00:30:33.943 --> 00:30:38.046]  The fish hatcheries are destroyed and that's where the salmon comes from.
[00:30:38.086 --> 00:30:39.246]  The olives are gone.
[00:30:39.306 --> 00:30:41.087]  The grapes from the wineries are gone.
[00:30:41.107 --> 00:30:42.488]  The marijuana is gone.
[00:30:42.548 --> 00:30:44.109]  The rice crop is here.
[00:30:44.129 --> 00:30:46.150]  The tomatoes are covered in ash.
[00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:52.094]  Things can be salvaged, some of them, but it's going to be expensive to the farmers and that's going to be passed on to you.
[00:30:52.154 --> 00:30:54.075]  The graping lands for the
[00:30:54.947 --> 00:30:57.368]  Sure, so a lot of the country gets fed by California.
[00:30:57.428 --> 00:30:59.809]  Some numbers are the 20% of our food comes from there.
[00:30:59.829 --> 00:31:06.431]  And imagine all of that with the rest of the lockdown and the shutdown and farms destroying their crops because they can't even sell them.
[00:31:06.451 --> 00:31:07.411]  No one will even take them.
[00:31:07.491 --> 00:31:08.291]  That's a great point.
[00:31:08.351 --> 00:31:10.952]  This is really going to add to the economy in crisis.
[00:31:11.432 --> 00:31:15.315]  Nobody's talking about the destruction of food in the Central Valley of California.
[00:31:15.375 --> 00:31:18.817]  With ash and smoke alone, not to mention the fires.
[00:31:19.197 --> 00:31:21.379]  So those tomatoes are covered in ash.
[00:31:21.519 --> 00:31:24.181]  The nectarines, the peaches, the olives.
[00:31:24.481 --> 00:31:29.584]  And they can't salvage, they can't pressure wash a crop full of fruit or tomatoes.
[00:31:29.684 --> 00:31:31.766]  It'll turn into tomato sauce.
[00:31:31.946 --> 00:31:35.408]  Sure, and most things can't be cleaned once ash is on them and sints on them.
[00:31:35.468 --> 00:31:36.689]  It really, it tastes horrible.
[00:31:36.749 --> 00:31:41.473]  What about the fish hatcheries that feed most of the salmon to our nation throughout Oregon?
[00:31:41.493 --> 00:31:45.456]  Those fish are choking on ash, and ash and water turns to lye.
[00:31:45.736 --> 00:31:52.481]  And if they're doing like I am, the rice and beans and all of that, they need to get the nutritional products you saw as a supplement.
[00:31:52.861 --> 00:31:54.863]  If they thought they were going to go out and get a box,
[00:31:54.983 --> 00:31:58.487]  The livestock in Northern California or Oregon, those animals are gone.
[00:31:58.607 --> 00:32:00.730]  The livestock has no more grazing ground.
[00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:03.593]  I'm telling you, the food is destroyed.
[00:32:03.613 --> 00:32:11.362]  And so people need to not go get that new pair of Nikes for $200, but buy storable food, buy nutritional products.
[00:32:11.762 --> 00:32:14.784]  Listen, I never go on air just to sell products to try to scare people.
[00:32:14.884 --> 00:32:17.426]  I mean, I'm selling the products to fund ourselves and it's good products.
[00:32:17.446 --> 00:32:21.869]  Yeah, you look at every economic metric going on, and this country's under attack.
[00:32:21.929 --> 00:32:25.092]  And they don't want people to be self-sufficient or to be ready.
[00:32:25.492 --> 00:32:26.813]  And you're absolutely right.
[00:32:32.301 --> 00:32:35.563]  That's how you support freedom, and it's products that you need.
[00:32:35.923 --> 00:32:36.344]  I had them.
[00:32:36.364 --> 00:32:39.986]  I had the Supermelt Vitality and Brain Force, and man, I gotta get me some more of that.
[00:32:40.006 --> 00:32:43.208]  Because there's a big difference when you have it and when you don't have it.
[00:32:43.709 --> 00:32:45.730]  Natural supplements that you all need.
[00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:54.996]  Get your t-shirts, and I think they still may have some videos left, but whatever it is that's on there, you gotta go to infowarestore.com and support freedom.
[00:32:55.537 --> 00:32:57.058]  Support freedom, people, alright?
[00:33:02.375 --> 00:33:06.479]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:06.999 --> 00:33:08.320]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:16.808 --> 00:33:19.771]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:33:20.051 --> 00:33:21.773]  Run on for a long time.
[00:33:24.033 --> 00:33:27.054]  You can run on for a long time.
[00:33:27.715 --> 00:33:29.996]  Run on for a long time.
[00:33:30.636 --> 00:33:32.777]  Run on for a long time.
[00:33:33.477 --> 00:33:35.918]  Sooner or later gonna cut you down.
[00:33:36.519 --> 00:33:47.624]  Alright, so a very aggressive, anti-human, corporate crime syndicate that controls China is forcibly merging us with it and putting us under the systems that they've used there for control.
[00:33:49.435 --> 00:33:51.216]  And President Trump tried to get U.S.
[00:33:51.257 --> 00:33:52.638]  control over our country.
[00:33:53.078 --> 00:33:54.219]  He did a pretty good job.
[00:33:54.379 --> 00:33:55.740]  He built up America.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.641]  He told us we should exist.
[00:33:57.681 --> 00:33:59.623]  He told us that having a country was good.
[00:34:00.063 --> 00:34:01.865]  He explained there were people selling our country out.
[00:34:04.126 --> 00:34:07.269]  And if you look at a CFR briefing or any of it, they admit America's done.
[00:34:07.329 --> 00:34:07.869]  We're over.
[00:34:07.949 --> 00:34:08.830]  China's the future.
[00:34:08.850 --> 00:34:12.313]  I was just watching the video during the break.
[00:34:12.333 --> 00:34:13.474]  We'll have it for you next segment.
[00:34:14.755 --> 00:34:16.656]  Biden's national security pick says U.S.
[00:34:16.676 --> 00:34:18.598]  should encourage China's rise.
[00:34:19.699 --> 00:34:22.020]  And not confront them.
[00:34:22.741 --> 00:34:24.802]  Let them own our debt, own Hollywood.
[00:34:26.303 --> 00:34:27.143]  Control big tech.
[00:34:27.623 --> 00:34:28.524]  Put in their 5G.
[00:34:30.405 --> 00:34:32.086]  Because these guys have merged with it.
[00:34:34.827 --> 00:34:36.668]  And again, that's why Apple's lobbying Congress.
[00:34:36.748 --> 00:34:44.893]  Oh no, pass that bill and don't enforce Trump's executive order that we can't use slave labor that's in confirmed Australian government reports and China confirms it.
[00:34:46.054 --> 00:34:48.315]  Billions of people in death camps just for their religion.
[00:34:49.974 --> 00:34:50.794]  Well, that's okay.
[00:34:50.874 --> 00:34:56.097]  I mean, you got another academic up there telling us how it's a good thing.
[00:34:56.957 --> 00:34:57.497]  For peace!
[00:34:58.618 --> 00:35:04.541]  You see, there'll be peace if we just let global corporate government, married with China, take over.
[00:35:06.041 --> 00:35:07.002]  So just remember that.
[00:35:07.262 --> 00:35:07.862]  Just remember that.
[00:35:07.982 --> 00:35:12.764]  I mean, I'll be sitting in a restaurant and the left will walk over and go, how dare you, you horrible monster?
[00:35:12.785 --> 00:35:13.525]  And I'll go, what have I done?
[00:35:15.518 --> 00:35:17.159]  Stop harassing those families.
[00:35:17.479 --> 00:35:18.980]  Hardly ever even talked about Sandy Hook.
[00:35:19.421 --> 00:35:20.761]  Never said harass people's families.
[00:35:20.962 --> 00:35:21.742]  I go, that's not true.
[00:35:21.942 --> 00:35:22.563]  Yes, you are!
[00:35:22.783 --> 00:35:24.123]  And I go, Apple runs slave camps.
[00:35:24.484 --> 00:35:25.424]  Shut up, Nazi!
[00:35:25.905 --> 00:35:26.885]  They don't care.
[00:35:27.245 --> 00:35:31.528]  They just want to feel good, go with the power structure, and think they're part of the system.
[00:35:31.988 --> 00:35:32.629]  But they're not.
[00:35:32.689 --> 00:35:34.570]  They're not even going to get a good future out of this.
[00:35:36.291 --> 00:35:43.616]  Just like the Washington Post said last year, Xi Jinping must crush Trump to save America.
[00:35:46.132 --> 00:35:48.594]  So let me read these headlines again of the martial law.
[00:35:49.274 --> 00:35:54.158]  Because when you actually read what the Deimos Group and all of them say, they say, it never ends.
[00:35:55.539 --> 00:36:00.243]  And even if you take an app, and even if you take all the vaccines, you still can't go places unless we say.
[00:36:00.783 --> 00:36:01.203]  Of course!
[00:36:01.463 --> 00:36:02.364]  That's the whole point!
[00:36:03.905 --> 00:36:11.391]  First it's, well, take your vaccine and take your tracker system and we'll, on your phone, maybe a chip later, and we'll let you travel some.
[00:36:11.411 --> 00:36:12.271]  You'll have a freedom pass.
[00:36:12.291 --> 00:36:15.514]  And then actually you learn, oh, sorry, that doesn't work either.
[00:36:16.732 --> 00:36:17.552]  It's like Darth Vader.
[00:36:19.433 --> 00:36:21.614]  Cheesy analogy, Empire Strikes Back, I saw the meme.
[00:36:23.375 --> 00:36:25.035]  In Lando Calrissian in Cloud City.
[00:36:27.176 --> 00:36:29.737]  Says, wait a minute, you're only supposed to take Han Solo, you're supposed to leave.
[00:36:31.298 --> 00:36:33.499]  The other's here with me, and he goes, I'm altering the deal.
[00:36:33.959 --> 00:36:35.239]  Pray it don't alter it any further.
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:38.881]  I mean, give me a break.
[00:36:44.008 --> 00:36:49.889]  Yeah, there's hours of videos snuck out of men with their hands behind their backs, bags over their heads, and they're taken and executed.
[00:36:50.549 --> 00:36:52.570]  Would you like me to show you some execution videos?
[00:36:52.590 --> 00:36:58.191]  A lot of times the local Chinese come to a sports stadium, and they watch it.
[00:36:59.431 --> 00:37:03.972]  And they shoot them, and they slit their throats, and it's just a big fun thing they do.
[00:37:04.632 --> 00:37:06.413]  But it's okay, because Tim Cook's gay.
[00:37:07.653 --> 00:37:09.453]  It's okay, because Tim Cook's gay.
[00:37:09.974 --> 00:37:11.394]  It's okay, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:20.112]  And the average leftist now thinks like death camps are cool and like surveillance and oh they love the FBI and they love the CIA.
[00:37:20.132 --> 00:37:27.353]  They're all over the internet saying arrest Trump, arrest Jones, arrest, get their families, just get them!
[00:37:27.373 --> 00:37:31.074]  And what does Tim Cook call it when they censored me?
[00:37:31.094 --> 00:37:33.995]  He goes, oh we're curating Alex Jones, like a museum.
[00:37:36.357 --> 00:37:38.318]  Kind of like China's doing, but sorry, let's go back to the headlines.
[00:37:39.239 --> 00:37:44.202]  Belgians told police we'll knock on doors on Christmas to enforce COVID rules.
[00:37:44.643 --> 00:37:46.144]  New York's also announced the same thing.
[00:37:49.386 --> 00:37:51.547]  Just tell them your Black Lives Matter and you can burn the city down.
[00:37:52.728 --> 00:37:54.930]  Macron starts talking third wave of COVID.
[00:37:56.851 --> 00:37:58.572]  New York sets up quarantine checkpoints.
[00:37:59.653 --> 00:38:03.796]  The new normal, students at SUNY must test negative for COVID to leave for Thanksgiving.
[00:38:05.305 --> 00:38:11.067]  Journalist tweets herself harassing small businesses for owning an opening restaurant in defiance of lockdown.
[00:38:12.068 --> 00:38:16.010]  YouTube suspends pro-Trump news network for pointing out that COVID's an overblown hoax.
[00:38:16.810 --> 00:38:18.290]  Democrats have declared martial law.
[00:38:18.951 --> 00:38:21.752]  Biden tells Americans it's their patriotic duty to mask up.
[00:38:23.113 --> 00:38:25.433]  Pope Francis' new book praises George Floyd.
[00:38:25.774 --> 00:38:28.335]  BLM protests blast anti-lockdown protests.
[00:38:30.436 --> 00:38:33.537]  Rich Americans scrambling to buy golden passports to second country.
[00:38:35.333 --> 00:38:37.694]  The Mexico governor shuts down grocery stores for two weeks.
[00:38:39.556 --> 00:38:44.699]  German police detain man who drove car into anti-globalist message into the gate at Merkel's chancellery.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:50.042]  Oh yeah, and the Qantas CEO that says you'll have to take a vaccine to get on an airplane.
[00:38:50.663 --> 00:38:53.625]  Somebody just threw a pie in his little dirty face today.
[00:38:54.705 --> 00:38:56.566]  Let's go ahead and roll that video.
[00:38:56.606 --> 00:38:57.067]  Here it is.
[00:38:58.247 --> 00:39:03.511]  Six months since I've been here to announce the... F***ing heck.
[00:39:05.106 --> 00:39:09.349]  The business breakfast was well-advanced when the grim-faced attacker... Uh, that's good.
[00:39:10.149 --> 00:39:10.670]  That's good.
[00:39:11.470 --> 00:39:12.131]  Let's continue.
[00:39:12.151 --> 00:39:16.934]  I got a bunch of other news here, but let me just do this.
[00:39:17.454 --> 00:39:30.983]  I'm gonna come back, and I'm gonna hit Biden's National Security Advisor, President-elect, as they call him fraudulently, saying, why we have to let China take over and do whatever they want.
[00:39:32.143 --> 00:39:33.024]  Well, it's for peace!
[00:39:33.184 --> 00:39:34.365]  I mean, it's...
[00:39:35.233 --> 00:39:37.054]  But it's beyond never of Chamberlain and Hitler.
[00:39:38.055 --> 00:39:44.939]  This is being done because the globalists set China up, and they've got a deal to use that slave labor to leverage out all their competition.
[00:39:44.959 --> 00:39:49.221]  And that's what Trump was ending, which would help the Chinese people and help us, as Trump pointed out.
[00:39:50.822 --> 00:39:53.984]  They're using the Chinese people as slaves, and it's evil, and it's wrong.
[00:39:54.885 --> 00:39:55.965]  Then I'm gonna hit the big news.
[00:39:55.985 --> 00:39:57.366]  There's a lot of big election news.
[00:39:57.386 --> 00:39:58.267]  Trump is fighting back.
[00:39:58.787 --> 00:40:02.149]  He's still not out, but the gaslighting saying he lost is so strong.
[00:40:03.922 --> 00:40:05.903]  Then I'm going to tell you why he's in so much peril.
[00:40:06.123 --> 00:40:08.085]  I'm going to tell you now, but I'll tell you more after the break.
[00:40:09.165 --> 00:40:10.226]  All the Republicans have quit.
[00:40:10.246 --> 00:40:11.547]  He's down like 10% of his staff.
[00:40:12.327 --> 00:40:20.273]  They're all just going to get other jobs, and they all believe CNN, and they just see the gaslighting, like, oh, he's a Russian agent, oh, he's this, oh, he will be impeached.
[00:40:22.394 --> 00:40:25.956]  Folks are buying into the propaganda, and it is mind control.
[00:40:26.577 --> 00:40:31.980]  Trump's starting to win court cases, and Trump will win at the Supreme Court, and there was massive fraud, and it's coming out.
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:33.281]  We'll hit it all on the other side.
[00:40:35.725 --> 00:40:36.906]  Now let me hit something right now.
[00:40:37.626 --> 00:40:46.390]  It's been probably four or five years since My Patriot Supply, super high quality, storable food company, did a discount because they already had the lowest prices for the quality you're getting.
[00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:50.151]  Again, can you get something four or five times more that tastes even better?
[00:40:50.371 --> 00:40:50.511]  Yeah.
[00:40:50.531 --> 00:40:52.692]  But a lot of their stuff tastes delicious, gourmet.
[00:40:52.732 --> 00:40:53.993]  Other stuff tastes okay.
[00:40:54.633 --> 00:40:55.534]  Thing is, it's nutritious.
[00:40:56.054 --> 00:41:00.376]  It lasts 25 years and it's packed in the best containers of any storable food out there.
[00:41:00.676 --> 00:41:02.957]  And you get it quickly and they do what they say they're going to do.
[00:41:04.104 --> 00:41:06.265]  They've been our sponsor for, I don't know, 12, 13 years.
[00:41:06.285 --> 00:41:07.346]  They've been around 14 years.
[00:41:08.366 --> 00:41:10.428]  And they've become the biggest because they do a great job.
[00:41:11.308 --> 00:41:20.513]  I called them up two days ago and I said, I want to run a special through next week, 10% off, called The Great Reset Emergency Food Sale.
[00:41:20.814 --> 00:41:22.455]  The Great Reset Emergency Food Sale.
[00:41:22.475 --> 00:41:27.197]  So you go to preparewithalex.com and find the whole catalog at infowarestore.com.
[00:41:28.118 --> 00:41:30.519]  And they're in our backyard and they take the orders out daily.

[00:41:34.653 --> 00:41:44.617]  You go to preparewithalex.com and all of their storable food, except one thing that's sold out, one little specialty food, I think like a protein pack special.
[00:41:45.017 --> 00:41:46.918]  They can't discount that because it's sold out for a few weeks.
[00:41:47.778 --> 00:41:51.280]  They've got everything else there, all their regular meals, all their regular stuff.
[00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:54.601]  It's got all the protein stuff in it, just not the special protein only packs.
[00:41:56.493 --> 00:42:01.116]  They've got 99% of their catalog at preparewithalex.com.
[00:42:01.176 --> 00:42:05.960]  One more, preparewithalex.com or 888-411-0350.
[00:42:05.980 --> 00:42:07.121]  888-411-0350.
[00:42:07.221 --> 00:42:13.786]  And then separately, we have the new sale on infowarshore.com with all the stuff going on.
[00:42:13.846 --> 00:42:15.527]  It's always good to boost your immune system.

[00:42:18.309 --> 00:42:19.230]  Vitamin and mineral fusion.

[00:42:38.859 --> 00:42:39.719]  Talk about surface cleaning.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:41.901]  Infowarstore.com.
[00:42:43.322 --> 00:42:45.123]  It's all 10 to 60% off.
[00:42:47.298 --> 00:42:49.579]  Oh, and did I mention store-wide free shipping up to 60% off?
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:51.380]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.441]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:42:52.701 --> 00:42:54.542]  These are products you already need at Truth360Win.
[00:42:54.823 --> 00:42:56.323]  So please go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:42:56.363 --> 00:42:56.744]  Stay with us.
[00:43:02.561 --> 00:43:04.463]  Alex Jones, I believe, wants to get on.
[00:43:04.543 --> 00:43:13.069]  He feels that he has a particular take on the election that people need to hear, and since he's been thrown off of all the major media, he wants to get his word out.
[00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:15.711]  I think, in all fairness, we should let him have a word.
[00:43:15.831 --> 00:43:17.032]  There he is, Alex Jones.
[00:43:17.132 --> 00:43:17.813]  Alex, go ahead.
[00:43:22.556 --> 00:43:27.258]  We are witnessing the 100% reptilian rigged election.
[00:43:27.298 --> 00:43:28.479]  It's a globalist coup.
[00:43:28.799 --> 00:43:39.904]  It has been coordinated by Communist China Big Tech and now Lord Biden, the Communist pedophile Chai Com agent, wants to bury your ballots, delay the results of the election, knowing that Donald Trump wins.
[00:43:40.344 --> 00:43:41.425]  Infowars.com
[00:43:42.305 --> 00:43:44.827]  Now, you're making a lot of accusations.
[00:43:44.847 --> 00:43:45.888]  I don't even know where to begin.
[00:43:45.908 --> 00:43:48.049]  I think what you're saying is what?
[00:43:51.192 --> 00:43:56.736]  Listen, we need to prepare now for what the globalists have planned, which is the 79 days of hell.
[00:43:57.236 --> 00:43:58.877]  I told you Donald Trump's going to win big.
[00:43:58.897 --> 00:44:00.138]  The Democrats are going to contest it.
[00:44:00.158 --> 00:44:01.799]  They want a planetary reset.
[00:44:02.079 --> 00:44:04.800]  They don't want a pro-human future.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:06.781]  The Four Horsemen called for the UN takeover.
[00:44:06.821 --> 00:44:08.262]  The Davos Group is going to take over.
[00:44:08.302 --> 00:44:10.784]  They said the viral release is phase one.
[00:44:11.104 --> 00:44:13.705]  Now we enter the war games of phase two.
[00:44:13.985 --> 00:44:14.586]  InfoWars.com
[00:44:14.946 --> 00:44:16.866]  Listen, I've been saying this since day one.
[00:44:16.966 --> 00:44:21.087]  I've lost three of my molars from clenching my teeth over the past few weeks over this.
[00:44:21.147 --> 00:44:23.948]  I've fallen out like... There go three more.
[00:44:24.268 --> 00:44:34.670]  Listen, I only pray to God that Donald Trump has the strength to defeat these demons, because Fauci, Gates, and Soros, they are anti-human.
[00:44:37.050 --> 00:44:39.050]  Are you crying?
[00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:41.171]  They want to question us.
[00:44:41.211 --> 00:44:42.551]  They want to keep this lockdown going.
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:51.566]  Alex, you said, control yourself, you said the Democrats, the Democrats are anti-human.
[00:44:51.927 --> 00:44:52.707]  What is that about?
[00:44:53.007 --> 00:44:54.549]  This is a foreign coup d'etat.
[00:44:54.589 --> 00:44:56.570]  Listen, the covert war is over.
[00:44:56.610 --> 00:45:00.053]  They want to normalize centralized control, psychological algorithms.
[00:45:00.073 --> 00:45:00.754]  They want to take us.
[00:45:01.034 --> 00:45:02.515]  Bill Gates was on Epstein Island.
[00:45:02.975 --> 00:45:03.916]  We have the plane tickets.
[00:45:03.936 --> 00:45:05.577]  We can see the martial law power grab.
[00:45:05.618 --> 00:45:06.278]  We know this.
[00:45:06.618 --> 00:45:09.541]  Listen, the Info Warriors are not taking it anymore.
[00:45:09.561 --> 00:45:10.561]  They are writing in.
[00:45:10.942 --> 00:45:12.083]  They're mad globalists.
[00:45:12.583 --> 00:45:16.126]  And they're still mad at my tank driver, who did not reveal who he voted for.
[00:45:16.166 --> 00:45:18.108]  Here, I'll read you some of the Info Warrior feedback here.
[00:45:18.969 --> 00:45:21.811]  Alex, your tank driver is globalist scum.
[00:45:21.971 --> 00:45:26.736]  Hillary Clinton offered to finally admit to being reptilian, and it still didn't sway him.
[00:45:27.156 --> 00:45:28.317]  Not a team player.
[00:45:28.377 --> 00:45:30.639]  Maybe he should drive Soros' tank.
[00:45:30.679 --> 00:45:32.281]  Well, that's pretty good for him.
[00:45:32.341 --> 00:45:33.722]  He's gotta step up, that's what I said.
[00:45:34.042 --> 00:45:35.243]  I had a similar problem.
[00:45:35.683 --> 00:45:42.088]  My Ronnie the limo driver would not tell me who he was voting for, and your tank driver will not tell you who he's voting for.
[00:45:42.148 --> 00:45:43.329]  It's a serious problem.
[00:45:43.509 --> 00:45:46.051]  Listen, people are down with the mainstream psy-op.
[00:45:46.071 --> 00:45:52.135]  They want to vote for Queen, Demon, Hillary Clinton, and Lord Biden, and they want to push the Stockholm syndromes on people.
[00:45:52.415 --> 00:45:58.660]  The communists over Lord Biden is going to try and inoculate you with the experimental synthetic nanotech antibodies, right?
[00:45:59.060 --> 00:46:01.621]  Do not fall for the antibody cocktail when they give it to you.
[00:46:01.802 --> 00:46:02.162]  That's enough.
[00:46:02.182 --> 00:46:03.182]  I gotta go take a piss.
[00:46:03.222 --> 00:46:04.763]  Maybe after this I'm gonna bring the guys in.
[00:46:04.783 --> 00:46:09.085]  I want to hear what Owen Troyer and David Knight were up to last night, how they dealt with the election.
[00:46:09.385 --> 00:46:09.946]  I gotta get going.
[00:46:10.286 --> 00:46:11.747]  Infowars.com.
[00:46:11.987 --> 00:46:13.087]  Do not believe the globalists.
[00:46:13.307 --> 00:46:14.848]  Do not believe the manipulation of Google.
[00:46:15.008 --> 00:46:16.149]  They want to plunge the economy.
[00:46:16.429 --> 00:46:17.850]  It is the globalist model.
[00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:22.152]  And Alex, before you go, just Alex, why are we arresting Fauci again?
[00:46:22.592 --> 00:46:25.534]  Fauci runs the Chinese death camps with Tim Cook.
[00:46:25.554 --> 00:46:29.176]  Look, the governor of California already said we're going to inject 11-year-olds with vaccines.
[00:46:29.196 --> 00:46:30.857]  We're going to give them abortions without consent.
[00:46:31.137 --> 00:46:34.079]  These are weird, sick, twisted freakzoids.
[00:46:34.419 --> 00:46:37.922]  They want to give people HIV and that's what they've been doing all this time.
[00:46:37.942 --> 00:46:38.842]  Arrest Fauci.
[00:46:39.102 --> 00:46:39.803]  Arrest Gates.
[00:46:40.343 --> 00:46:41.424]  Infowars.com.
[00:46:46.487 --> 00:46:52.711]  We're the only ones who have money, so... Yeah, I don't want lots of people to get to hear him.
[00:46:53.471 --> 00:46:56.733]  Well, it's important we hear this.
[00:47:02.897 --> 00:47:08.801]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:12.165 --> 00:47:12.925]  We are back live.
[00:47:12.945 --> 00:47:15.686]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:47:15.706 --> 00:47:22.107]  I am your host and I am very honored to be here and very appreciative
[00:47:42.085 --> 00:47:48.352]  Now, I want you to know that we have John Rappaport coming up with a lot of key information in the next hour.
[00:47:48.372 --> 00:47:52.257]  Investigative journalist of nomorefakenews.com.
[00:47:52.377 --> 00:47:54.239]  You're going to want to stay tuned for that.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:58.685]  And I want you to understand, my life is in more danger than the average person's fighting this.
[00:48:00.131 --> 00:48:01.712]  These globalists are very, very ruthless.
[00:48:01.732 --> 00:48:03.013]  They're already trying to put me in prison.
[00:48:03.554 --> 00:48:07.037]  But I understand that God's the real governor of the universe, not these people.
[00:48:07.737 --> 00:48:10.119]  And that we have a responsibility to stand against them.
[00:48:10.159 --> 00:48:13.722]  And that all the freedom we have is because other people stood up against evil before us.
[00:48:14.343 --> 00:48:23.150]  And we're losing thousands of years of labor and war and blood and toil that people put into action to get us the freedom we got.
[00:48:24.551 --> 00:48:25.612]  And it's all being taken away.
[00:48:25.652 --> 00:48:26.773]  It's all collapsing right now.
[00:48:27.898 --> 00:48:28.739]  And so I want to tell you something.
[00:48:28.779 --> 00:48:31.921]  I'm somebody that always sleeps really, really good.
[00:48:33.182 --> 00:48:37.584]  The last 10 months, I'm up working at 2, 3 in the morning every night now.
[00:48:38.505 --> 00:48:39.786]  Believe me, the producers and people here know.
[00:48:39.826 --> 00:48:40.687]  I'm sending them messages.
[00:48:40.727 --> 00:48:41.247]  I'm calling them.
[00:48:43.669 --> 00:48:45.630]  We're just working because this is it.
[00:48:46.150 --> 00:48:48.252]  And I have real sorrow about what's happening.
[00:48:48.992 --> 00:48:51.614]  I'm going to take a few days off, which I haven't done in probably a year.
[00:48:52.574 --> 00:48:53.255]  I'm always working.
[00:48:54.856 --> 00:48:55.556]  To go to the woods.
[00:48:56.670 --> 00:49:01.315]  I've only, I've been to my dad's family ranch probably two times the last seven years.
[00:49:02.736 --> 00:49:03.697]  But I'm going to go out to the ranch.
[00:49:04.598 --> 00:49:05.419]  What's left of it.
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:08.683]  Sold most of it off over the years, but it's a lot of woods and stuff.
[00:49:09.564 --> 00:49:18.133]  And, uh, I'm going to go hike around with my children and just totally disconnect and turn the phone off for a couple of days, but I'll be back on Friday.
[00:49:19.841 --> 00:49:23.144]  I know it's going to be here on Friday, but I'm going to leave at the end of the hour.
[00:49:23.184 --> 00:49:24.805]  I'll introduce John Rappaport coming up.
[00:49:25.346 --> 00:49:27.728]  I've got to unplug and just get close to God and decide what I'm going to do.
[00:49:30.110 --> 00:49:31.071]  All of this goes together.
[00:49:31.131 --> 00:49:33.433]  Communist China with the mainstream media and the U.N.
[00:49:33.853 --> 00:49:37.136]  launched the hysteria, showed us the science fiction nightmare.
[00:49:38.757 --> 00:49:40.058]  They got us to put the mask on.
[00:49:40.098 --> 00:49:41.359]  They told us just 15 days.
[00:49:42.260 --> 00:49:43.341]  Just put the handcuffs on.
[00:49:43.601 --> 00:49:45.303]  The handcuffs are never coming off without a fight.
[00:49:46.741 --> 00:49:52.245]  And when I get up here and I tell you all this horrible news, it's because you're in the handcuffs now.
[00:49:52.885 --> 00:49:59.209]  So am I. And lying to yourselves and hoping that it's going to be okay and we'll just get used to it is not the case.
[00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:05.913]  They want to take us to a very dystopic place very quickly and they'll take us there if we don't resist.
[00:50:06.554 --> 00:50:09.956]  Not resisting is like oiling up a slide.
[00:50:11.257 --> 00:50:12.638]  You want to get gravel on the slide.
[00:50:12.678 --> 00:50:13.538]  You want to hang on.
[00:50:13.919 --> 00:50:14.799]  You want to fight back.
[00:50:14.839 --> 00:50:15.940]  You want to get off the slide.
[00:50:17.449 --> 00:50:18.990]  We're up the edge of this cliff right now.
[00:50:20.010 --> 00:50:21.591]  We've all been taught to be compliant.
[00:50:22.271 --> 00:50:25.553]  We've all been taught with, oh, just don't say the N-word.
[00:50:25.573 --> 00:50:26.634]  Well, I don't want to say that, fine.
[00:50:27.034 --> 00:50:28.835]  Oh, well, just don't say the mother or father word.
[00:50:28.915 --> 00:50:29.975]  Oh, don't just say Jesus.
[00:50:30.455 --> 00:50:33.657]  Oh, don't just, oh, don't speak up when they get censored.
[00:50:33.677 --> 00:50:34.337]  It might happen to you.
[00:50:34.858 --> 00:50:36.478]  And like dominoes, we're falling down.
[00:50:37.939 --> 00:50:41.761]  Now here's Sidney Powell, and she's getting ready to release the algorithm info.
[00:50:42.041 --> 00:50:43.522]  You notice Tucker Carlson, who I really like,
[00:50:45.083 --> 00:50:46.444]  Got mad at him and said, where's the proof?
[00:50:47.124 --> 00:50:53.669]  Well, they have it, and they're getting the algorithms, and you can see from the numbers, where they go straight up, it was manipulated.
[00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:59.633]  And we've talked to the companies, I've talked to the lawyers, I've been talking to the Trump White House.
[00:50:59.693 --> 00:51:03.976]  Trump has a real strategy to overturn Georgia and Pennsylvania.
[00:51:04.357 --> 00:51:14.204]  The easiest is Georgia with the signatures, and even with the last fake recount where they just re-ran the same computers, they're still looking around and found tens of thousands of hidden ballots that were all Trump.
[00:51:14.875 --> 00:51:16.476]  What's this box over here, all Trump?
[00:51:16.796 --> 00:51:17.196]  What's this?
[00:51:17.256 --> 00:51:18.377]  I mean, it's bad.
[00:51:18.437 --> 00:51:19.317]  And they're all real votes.
[00:51:19.337 --> 00:51:22.599]  Because see, conservatives aren't cheats.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:33.065]  Again, the FBI went around to upwards of 10,000 people, offering them millions of dollars to work for the Russians, and no one would take the money.
[00:51:33.425 --> 00:51:38.207]  They couldn't get one Trump supporter that they wanted to set up.
[00:51:38.988 --> 00:51:40.529]  They couldn't get one of us.
[00:51:40.909 --> 00:51:42.550]  Now that's why we're so good and strong.
[00:51:43.629 --> 00:51:45.651]  Let's see, that's also why we're so weak.
[00:51:45.791 --> 00:51:50.315]  And I'm not into cheating, but I'm just telling you, that's why we're in so much trouble.
[00:51:50.816 --> 00:51:52.698]  It's because the enemy cheats and doesn't get in trouble.
[00:51:53.499 --> 00:51:54.339]  And then we don't cheat.
[00:51:55.480 --> 00:51:56.622]  We just basically don't do it.
[00:51:57.703 --> 00:52:01.907]  And I'm, the older I get, the less, I mean, I just, I have trouble, I have real trouble lying.
[00:52:03.493 --> 00:52:04.274]  I mean, I do.
[00:52:04.294 --> 00:52:05.575]  I'm not even saying I'm a good guy.
[00:52:05.615 --> 00:52:06.916]  It's like, cops pulled me over.
[00:52:07.336 --> 00:52:07.997]  Have you been drinking?
[00:52:08.257 --> 00:52:08.457]  Yep.
[00:52:08.637 --> 00:52:09.318]  Boom, you're arrested.
[00:52:09.878 --> 00:52:10.839]  Other times, I lied about it.
[00:52:11.179 --> 00:52:13.341]  I just got to the point where I have real trouble lying.
[00:52:13.861 --> 00:52:18.605]  It's because my brain processes things so much better just being truthful all the time.
[00:52:19.906 --> 00:52:23.930]  And they were like, why do you tell people this stuff about yourself?
[00:52:24.390 --> 00:52:25.451]  Let's just get it out on the table.
[00:52:27.725 --> 00:52:28.926]  These people are the opposite, though.
[00:52:29.026 --> 00:52:32.508]  Everything they say is a lie, and it creates mental illness.
[00:52:32.548 --> 00:52:33.809]  But I'm digressing.
[00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:34.730]  Here's Powell.
[00:52:36.831 --> 00:52:39.733]  The whole video's at Infowars.com, but here it is.
[00:52:40.594 --> 00:52:41.595]  Yes, I agree.
[00:52:41.895 --> 00:52:44.397]  I mean, that's exactly how blatant it is.
[00:52:44.817 --> 00:52:47.499]  And all kinds of it are equally blatant.
[00:52:48.061 --> 00:52:52.864]  I mean, people sitting on the floor and writing on the side of buses, filling out ballot after ballot.
[00:52:53.324 --> 00:52:54.925]  It's in your face everywhere.
[00:52:54.945 --> 00:52:58.307]  The statistical evidence is insurmountable.
[00:52:58.727 --> 00:53:02.289]  The mathematical evidence is to mathematical impossibilities.
[00:53:02.869 --> 00:53:06.371]  There's no way there was anything but widespread election fraud here.
[00:53:06.411 --> 00:53:14.856]  We've got one witness that says in Arizona, at least there were 35,000 votes added to every Democratic candidate just to start their voting off.
[00:53:15.507 --> 00:53:19.629]  It's like getting your $500 of monopoly money to begin with when you haven't done anything.
[00:53:20.450 --> 00:53:22.431]  She's a former federal prosecutor, very respected.
[00:53:23.971 --> 00:53:25.632]  Full videos on Infowars.com.
[00:53:26.693 --> 00:53:28.093]  And I don't just need to believe her.
[00:53:28.534 --> 00:53:32.736]  I've seen more than 20 videos, some of you, in Pennsylvania and in Michigan.
[00:53:33.695 --> 00:53:38.879]  And in Wisconsin's, where we've seen it, where the guy's looking over his shoulder.
[00:53:38.899 --> 00:53:44.262]  It's like when your kid walks in the kitchen, acting a little sneaky, and you walk out and go, I bet Junior's eating the cookies.
[00:53:44.822 --> 00:53:49.025]  And sure as hell, you walk around and there's your son with a whole box of cookies eating.
[00:53:49.045 --> 00:53:50.987]  And I said, no cookies till after dinner.
[00:53:51.367 --> 00:53:53.448]  Well, I mean, they're on video looking over their shoulder.
[00:53:53.468 --> 00:53:55.069]  They just go, screw it.
[00:53:55.089 --> 00:53:56.250]  And you start filling out the ballots.
[00:53:57.851 --> 00:53:59.532]  And there's all these videos.
[00:54:02.114 --> 00:54:03.215]  And then you find out it's all
[00:54:05.709 --> 00:54:10.091]  Empty ballots that just got thrown into mailboxes, and then they just fill them out.
[00:54:12.693 --> 00:54:13.553]  And that's what they did.
[00:54:13.974 --> 00:54:15.014]  They stole for months.
[00:54:15.354 --> 00:54:25.320]  And that's the good news is, Trump won in such a massive landslide that months of fraud, and then all the fraud that took place on the night wasn't enough, they had to then keep stuffing.
[00:54:25.880 --> 00:54:27.941]  Because they wanted that victory day one.
[00:54:27.981 --> 00:54:28.601]  They didn't get it.
[00:54:29.642 --> 00:54:33.204]  So they had to shut it down in all those states, five states, and bring them all in.
[00:54:34.701 --> 00:54:35.703]  Let's go over some of these headlines.
[00:54:37.045 --> 00:54:37.386]  Poll!
[00:54:37.486 --> 00:54:38.948]  A new poll out.
[00:54:39.289 --> 00:54:44.137]  97% of GOP voters don't believe Biden won the election.
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:47.283]  Well that's why I'm going to DC on the 12th.
[00:54:48.902 --> 00:54:51.003]  And I'm going to be there for several days surrounding the White House.
[00:54:51.043 --> 00:54:52.363]  They're having another million-person march.
[00:54:52.383 --> 00:54:53.204]  It needs to be a lot bigger.
[00:54:54.044 --> 00:54:56.505]  Pointing out the reality that Biden couldn't get 10 people out there.
[00:54:56.525 --> 00:54:57.485]  We're going to get several million.
[00:54:57.845 --> 00:54:58.686]  Go to D.C.
[00:54:58.726 --> 00:54:59.446]  December 12th.
[00:55:00.086 --> 00:55:02.987]  I'll be there on the 11th, the 12th, the 13th.
[00:55:03.267 --> 00:55:04.868]  And I'm calling to occupy D.C.
[00:55:06.528 --> 00:55:10.070]  for literally putting a communist Chinese agent in the White House through fraud, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:10.090 --> 00:55:10.610]  Let's continue.
[00:55:12.028 --> 00:55:12.448]  Repeat!
[00:55:12.929 --> 00:55:17.172]  Georgia sees 800,000 absentee ballot requests for January election.
[00:55:17.672 --> 00:55:21.575]  Oh, and they're telling people that don't live in the state, go file residency fraudulently.
[00:55:22.876 --> 00:55:26.018]  The Democratic Party is, wow, just open criminal activity.
[00:55:26.999 --> 00:55:29.420]  Minnesota Republicans sue to stop election certification.
[00:55:29.981 --> 00:55:31.982]  Secretary of State illegally altered election laws.
[00:55:32.222 --> 00:55:37.326]  And a judge in Pennsylvania just blocked the certification, saying they have to move forward with a criminal investigation.
[00:55:37.926 --> 00:55:38.747]  It's all breaking right now.
[00:55:39.912 --> 00:55:41.674]  Not going to see it on the national news though.
[00:55:42.194 --> 00:55:43.535]  They'll go, oh, there's no evidence.
[00:55:43.635 --> 00:55:44.516]  Oh, there's no challenge.
[00:55:44.777 --> 00:55:45.978]  Trump's not winning anything.
[00:55:47.239 --> 00:55:50.001]  Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan legislators to begin public hearings.
[00:55:50.862 --> 00:55:52.744]  That's the legislative leaders that met with Trump.
[00:55:53.004 --> 00:55:55.566]  They went and found a few low level Republicans that hadn't been told yet.
[00:55:55.607 --> 00:55:56.768]  They go, that's not true.
[00:55:57.228 --> 00:55:59.070]  Then the leaders said, no, we met with Trump.
[00:55:59.130 --> 00:55:59.930]  See how they play games.
[00:56:00.211 --> 00:56:01.032]  Oh, that's not true either.
[00:56:01.152 --> 00:56:01.772]  There's no hearings.
[00:56:01.792 --> 00:56:02.213]  There's nothing.
[00:56:02.433 --> 00:56:03.113]  Nothing's happening here.
[00:56:05.295 --> 00:56:05.756]  Continuing.
[00:56:09.056 --> 00:56:12.720]  Group falls lawsuit with Wisconsin Supreme Court alleging 150,000 fraudulent ballots.
[00:56:14.301 --> 00:56:17.745]  Biden promises amnesty for 11 million illegals in first 100 days.
[00:56:18.165 --> 00:56:20.387]  There's video of it, but I'm not going to torture you having to see it.
[00:56:21.248 --> 00:56:25.592]  Japanese foreign minister announces plan to transform Japan into diverse, multi-ethnic society.
[00:56:25.853 --> 00:56:31.739]  They want to bring in more people that aren't Japanese than Japanese, he said, and let them vote for the liberal and communist parties.
[00:56:31.819 --> 00:56:32.940]  Yeah, that's globalism.
[00:56:34.827 --> 00:56:38.950]  Left this clamor for Trump to be dragged out of the White House in handcuffs, but they want to defund the police.
[00:56:41.012 --> 00:56:44.094]  Twitter to warn users when they like a misleading post.
[00:56:44.454 --> 00:56:46.216]  Oh, now you'll be punished for what you like.
[00:56:46.296 --> 00:56:50.259]  See, you're not allowed to have an opinion in this giant New World Order gulag.
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:53.501]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:56:54.002 --> 00:56:59.886]  And two big exclusive interviews with the Overstock CEO that was very credible are on InfoWars.com and Band.Video.
[00:56:59.906 --> 00:57:04.270]  You should go watch them and you should share them because it's an info war.
[00:57:05.583 --> 00:57:12.627]  Or you can just listen to The Globalist and not have Christmas and not have Thanksgiving and get ready for the highway checkpoints.
[00:57:12.647 --> 00:57:16.770]  Because the illegal aliens, they have a record number pouring across now that they think Biden won.
[00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:18.931]  And they're just saying, we're not going to test them for diseases.
[00:57:19.171 --> 00:57:22.713]  We're not going to check them for TB that killed a million, 200,000 people last year.
[00:57:23.053 --> 00:57:24.654]  That's 10 times what COVID has.
[00:57:25.134 --> 00:57:27.776]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:57:27.816 --> 00:57:31.638]  But you on the highway, there'll be checkpoints to train you how to be a good slave.
[00:57:31.798 --> 00:57:33.119]  But the borders are wide open.
[00:57:33.399 --> 00:57:33.799]  Woo-hoo!
[00:57:35.060 --> 00:57:37.300]  Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, preparewithalex.com.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:38.861]  You need storable food for the future.
[00:57:38.921 --> 00:57:41.581]  Last 25 years, insurance you can eat.
[00:57:41.601 --> 00:57:42.581]  10% off a rare sale.
[00:57:42.881 --> 00:57:43.922]  Only goes till next Wednesday.
[00:57:43.942 --> 00:57:45.082]  Preparewithalex.com.
[00:57:45.102 --> 00:57:46.222]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:46.242 --> 00:57:46.642]  Stay with us.
[00:57:50.543 --> 00:57:53.123]  Jay Rock, the trucker in Miami, Florida.
[00:57:53.143 --> 00:57:54.363]  You're on the InfoWars War Room.
[00:57:54.403 --> 00:57:54.783]  Go ahead.
[00:57:55.283 --> 00:57:59.124]  I learned a whole lot just from this right here, man.
[00:57:59.144 --> 00:58:04.205]  This was a life-changing experience for all of us, actually.
[00:58:05.046 --> 00:58:06.607]  And all the people that we met.
[00:58:07.048 --> 00:58:08.509]  You know, I met you guys.
[00:58:08.529 --> 00:58:11.011]  I mean, I came to the Washington, D.C.
[00:58:11.532 --> 00:58:12.533]  I met him at the restaurant.
[00:58:12.553 --> 00:58:15.735]  I ain't gonna say my real name, but Jay Rock, the truck driver.
[00:58:16.176 --> 00:58:17.997]  It was, uh, it was amazing, man.
[00:58:18.017 --> 00:58:19.759]  All right, let me do a quick plug.
[00:58:20.359 --> 00:58:25.444]  Yo, the turbo force and the super male vitality.
[00:58:26.164 --> 00:58:28.006]  That took me the whole way.
[00:58:28.346 --> 00:58:30.548]  I got up around four o'clock in the morning.
[00:58:31.918 --> 00:58:35.439]  All the way to, I left over there like about 9.34.
[00:58:35.619 --> 00:58:39.521]  I looked at the clock before I jumped in the Uber and went back to my truck.
[00:58:39.901 --> 00:58:45.003]  And yeah, Turbo Force and I got some, also the fish oil.
[00:58:45.543 --> 00:58:52.886]  And that's why I love you guys, man, because this right here, it shows me the products really work.
[00:58:53.486 --> 00:58:55.467]  It's not just all talk, you understand?
[00:58:56.092 --> 00:58:59.834]  Well, I mean, I talk to truckers all day long, and they tell me the same thing.
[00:59:00.255 --> 00:59:02.476]  The turbo force is a godsend.
[00:59:03.597 --> 00:59:08.100]  Man, it's amazing, bro, and how it really works, man.
[00:59:08.160 --> 00:59:09.241]  It really works, man.
[00:59:09.441 --> 00:59:13.503]  The X2, I put that couple drops in my water right there.
[00:59:13.543 --> 00:59:16.766]  That's like another little power mode thing right there, man.
[00:59:16.786 --> 00:59:24.431]  I'm from Miami, and that water down there, especially in the trenches, they don't give us that good water over there.
[00:59:26.064 --> 00:59:29.645]  When I first got the X2, it really had me detoxing.
[00:59:30.346 --> 00:59:31.186]  All that other stuff.
[00:59:31.226 --> 00:59:36.668]  But like, after a couple weeks, it kind of like, it balanced the mind.
[00:59:37.188 --> 00:59:38.689]  It did something very special.
[00:59:38.749 --> 00:59:40.309]  So I really appreciate that.
[00:59:41.170 --> 00:59:43.651]  And man, you guys are some real deal patriots, man.
[00:59:43.691 --> 00:59:44.771]  It was amazing.
[00:59:44.931 --> 00:59:45.952]  Well, thank you, J-Rock.
[00:59:46.012 --> 00:59:48.152]  And thank you so much for your support and the call.
[00:59:48.172 --> 00:59:49.373]  Wow, what a great call.
[01:00:07.239 --> 01:00:07.819]  Welcome back.
[01:00:07.899 --> 01:00:08.900]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:10.040]  John Rappaport's coming up.
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:12.100]  And he's ready to lay it on you.
[01:00:13.921 --> 01:00:14.941]  Look at all these headlines.
[01:00:15.401 --> 01:00:19.062]  Biden's team says it isn't necessary for him to meet with Trump during transition.
[01:00:19.323 --> 01:00:20.543]  Because Trump's not meeting with him.
[01:00:20.783 --> 01:00:21.423]  It's all crap.
[01:00:22.383 --> 01:00:24.904]  Judge dismisses Trump's campaign's Pennsylvania lawsuit.
[01:00:25.284 --> 01:00:26.905]  Slams strained reasoning.
[01:00:28.285 --> 01:00:29.425]  Those are all Democrat operatives.
[01:00:29.726 --> 01:00:30.406]  We expect that.
[01:00:30.486 --> 01:00:31.686]  They plan to go to the Supreme Court.
[01:00:32.726 --> 01:00:34.387]  But here's what you won't see in national news.
[01:00:37.281 --> 01:00:40.464]  Pennsylvania judge blocks further election certification steps.
[01:00:41.845 --> 01:00:49.451]  Pennsylvania judge issued a temporary restraining order to the state for taking any further action to certify the election results.
[01:00:50.251 --> 01:01:00.059]  The ruling stops action until November 27th hearing to the extent that there remains any further action to perfect the certification of the results for the general election.
[01:01:02.568 --> 01:01:06.449]  But you heard that Pennsylvania and all these states were certified.
[01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:07.010]  They weren't.
[01:01:07.150 --> 01:01:09.431]  So the media is at next level fraud.
[01:01:11.031 --> 01:01:14.192]  Gore didn't concede for 37 days until the Supreme Court ruled against him.
[01:01:14.212 --> 01:01:15.293]  We're only 27 days now.
[01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:17.534]  But they tell you it's unprecedented.
[01:01:17.794 --> 01:01:18.694]  Trump's a dictator.
[01:01:18.934 --> 01:01:20.015]  The military should remove him.
[01:01:20.415 --> 01:01:23.656]  They're preying on the general public's ignorance of process.
[01:01:24.855 --> 01:01:29.359]  There was a good article yesterday in Town Hall that laid it out that Trump's got a very good chance.
[01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:30.841]  13,000 votes.
[01:01:31.301 --> 01:01:34.664]  They found a bunch of extra votes even in the automatic recount, which shouldn't have found any.
[01:01:35.405 --> 01:01:36.686]  Trump didn't even want the automatic recount.
[01:01:36.726 --> 01:01:38.668]  He wants to go in and check the signatures.
[01:01:39.048 --> 01:01:40.170]  They didn't even check the signatures.
[01:01:40.190 --> 01:01:40.990]  They just accepted them.
[01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:42.992]  And you have all these videos.
[01:01:43.172 --> 01:01:45.775]  We played it a month before the election in Philadelphia.
[01:01:47.396 --> 01:01:49.959]  Guy looking over his shoulder and like riding on it and going...
[01:01:51.786 --> 01:01:57.088]  And now, there's all these videos, I've seen more than 20 of them, of people doing that.
[01:01:57.448 --> 01:02:00.610]  And them covering up the windows with cardboard and kicking the Trump people out.
[01:02:00.670 --> 01:02:02.450]  Of course they're engaged in mass fraud.
[01:02:03.191 --> 01:02:06.032]  Of course Dominion's been decertified to a bunch of states because of fraud.
[01:02:07.792 --> 01:02:12.374]  But they just keep gaslighting you, telling you that that isn't the case.
[01:02:12.414 --> 01:02:13.735]  They keep lying to you.
[01:02:14.855 --> 01:02:19.157]  Now, I want to hit another piece of news before we go to break and then introduce John Rappaport, who's going to be taking over.
[01:02:20.902 --> 01:02:26.666]  Biden doesn't just want open borders, so they can bring in new voters they control, in his own admission.
[01:02:27.667 --> 01:02:32.830]  His new national security pick, as he's with the media, there's a new hoax that he's the president-elect.
[01:02:34.051 --> 01:02:46.780]  Jake Sullivan worked for the Clintons, and he gave a long speech, I'm not going to play the whole thing, but he says, we need to encourage China's rise, and not block any of it, and that's how we stop war.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:49.882]  Oh, give them the personnel office management hack?
[01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:57.310]  Give them all the debt, let them own Hollywood, let them put in Huawei 5G, let them do whatever they want.
[01:02:58.491 --> 01:03:07.094]  The globalists are using China to absorb us, and here he is talking about this out-of-control behavior with a regime that's killed five times what Hitler did.
[01:03:07.154 --> 01:03:07.514]  Here it is.
[01:03:08.714 --> 01:03:13.276]  For Xi, a new model meant, you stay on your side of the Pacific and we'll stay on ours.
[01:03:14.076 --> 01:03:18.878]  So, the term sort of fell out of use fairly quickly, at least on the American side.
[01:03:20.612 --> 01:03:25.494]  In any event, the basic strategic dynamic that produced the idea of the new model remains.
[01:03:25.834 --> 01:03:32.137]  The inherent instability generated by a competition between a rising power and an established power.
[01:03:33.098 --> 01:03:38.821]  Now, Owen Harrys was right when he warned against containment of China.
[01:03:39.341 --> 01:03:41.202]  That is a self-defeating policy.
[01:03:41.782 --> 01:03:43.263]  But so is acquiescence.
[01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:52.695]  We need to strike a middle course, one that encourages China's rise in a manner consistent with an open, fair, rules-based regional order.
[01:03:53.416 --> 01:04:02.322]  This will require care and prudence and strategic foresight, and maybe even more basically, it will require sustained attention.
[01:04:03.603 --> 01:04:07.646]  It may not have escaped your notice that these are not in ample supply in Washington right now.
[01:04:09.562 --> 01:04:19.636]  And now amidst this discussion of the U.S.-China relationship, let's not forget... Alright, it goes on for an hour, but here he is, making it sound very nice to Obi, friendly, let them do what they want.
[01:04:20.384 --> 01:04:21.324]  They're taking us over.
[01:04:21.364 --> 01:04:23.105]  They're an authoritarian model, AI.
[01:04:23.465 --> 01:04:24.785]  They ran their whole COVID hoax.
[01:04:25.285 --> 01:04:29.667]  We, like Chicken Little, rented our houses and they're saying we never come out as China becomes the global engine.
[01:04:29.907 --> 01:04:31.247]  We're being shut off.
[01:04:32.067 --> 01:04:34.788]  They're saying if a factory has one COVID case, the factory closes.
[01:04:35.008 --> 01:04:39.309]  If there's one COVID case in a grocery store, you don't just pull all the employees, you shut it down.
[01:04:39.569 --> 01:04:40.390]  This is siege.
[01:04:40.450 --> 01:04:40.990]  It's war.
[01:04:42.196 --> 01:04:44.738]  And all the little compliant sheep think they're heroes doing this.
[01:04:45.038 --> 01:04:50.882]  They're destroying the future and starving the third world to death in a chain reaction that I'll tell you about briefly.
[01:04:51.142 --> 01:04:53.504]  And then hand the baton to Jon Rappaport of nomorefakenews.com.
[01:05:01.127 --> 01:05:07.471]  Urgent warnings are being issued right now by the United Nations, the Davos Group, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs.
[01:05:07.791 --> 01:05:13.335]  They're saying that the COVID virus is going to cause a global depression and hundreds of millions to starve to death.
[01:05:13.755 --> 01:05:14.476]  Incredible!
[01:05:14.996 --> 01:05:23.522]  They're the very organizations that ordered the global lockdowns that are causing the chain reaction that's causing the mass starvation, not the COVID virus.
[01:05:23.882 --> 01:05:24.602]  That is a fact.
[01:05:25.042 --> 01:05:30.286]  And all the hero sheep that wear the mask to go along with this are signing on to mass murder.
[01:05:30.626 --> 01:05:31.726]  Bigger than what Hitler did.
[01:05:32.166 --> 01:05:35.187]  That's when we got the Geneva Convention and the Nuremberg Code.
[01:05:35.627 --> 01:05:44.368]  This is a medical, world government, tyrannical takeover, causing starvation, setting up world IVs, and coming with forced inoculations.
[01:05:44.588 --> 01:05:49.289]  And now Bank of America says global unrest is sure to trigger an even bigger depression.
[01:05:49.649 --> 01:05:51.149]  That story's on Infowars.com.
[01:05:51.450 --> 01:05:59.711]  That's why it's vital for all of you to be public and to say you do not stand for this or the mass global genocide being caused by the planetary Great Reset.
[01:06:12.424 --> 01:06:19.088]  I came here looking for something I couldn't find anywhere else.
[01:06:21.570 --> 01:06:24.132]  But I don't want to be nobody.
[01:06:25.993 --> 01:06:28.694]  Just want a chance to be myself.
[01:06:28.895 --> 01:06:32.057]  Alright ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:32.377 --> 01:06:35.259]  I am your host Alex Jones and I'm going to hand the baton to John Rappaport.
[01:06:36.308 --> 01:06:42.090]  From nomorefakenews.com, great investigative journalists, some of the top TV networks, you name it, ferreting out stories.
[01:06:42.730 --> 01:06:46.891]  One of the producers behind the scenes, good friend of mine for, I don't know, 15, 20 years.
[01:06:48.452 --> 01:06:49.932]  And boy, has it all come true.
[01:06:50.113 --> 01:06:54.654]  And when I tell this story briefly and hand the baton to him, I want to tell it not because I feel powerful.
[01:06:56.155 --> 01:06:57.735]  I mean, I can get my security guy in here.
[01:06:57.995 --> 01:06:58.835]  He's a serious guy.
[01:06:59.376 --> 01:07:03.237]  You know, worked for Army, the Marines, Blackwater, CIA, you name it.
[01:07:04.133 --> 01:07:05.435]  And he'll tell you, you've never seen anything like it.
[01:07:05.615 --> 01:07:08.017]  I'm being followed everywhere by the FBI and the CIA now.
[01:07:08.698 --> 01:07:08.918]  Okay?
[01:07:09.399 --> 01:07:12.402]  They come and they sit down next to us at restaurants with no one in the building.
[01:07:12.643 --> 01:07:13.804]  They say, how you doing, Mr. Jones?
[01:07:13.824 --> 01:07:15.786]  As soon as I pull my phone out, they put a mask on.
[01:07:16.587 --> 01:07:17.748]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:07:19.350 --> 01:07:20.952]  And it's because they already know what happened.
[01:07:22.042 --> 01:07:26.006]  They saw us with that crowd of a half million or more chanting Alex Jones.
[01:07:26.046 --> 01:07:27.588]  It wasn't about my personal power trip.
[01:07:27.868 --> 01:07:29.710]  I felt the angel of death flying around when they were doing that.
[01:07:29.931 --> 01:07:32.053]  Because the system knows we have real support.
[01:07:32.734 --> 01:07:34.015]  And they know we got Trump elected.
[01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:35.177]  They're afraid of you.
[01:07:37.159 --> 01:07:39.061]  And so I gotta just tell you the good news though.
[01:07:45.154 --> 01:07:48.336]  I've gotten a bunch of calls from very prominent people.
[01:07:48.436 --> 01:07:51.358]  Some of the biggest talk show hosts on TV, radio, podcasting.
[01:07:51.619 --> 01:07:52.679]  They've all been calling me.
[01:07:54.521 --> 01:07:56.282]  Saying, you know, I want to apologize to you.
[01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:57.143]  I thought you were nuts.
[01:07:57.303 --> 01:07:58.864]  Everything you said is now happening.
[01:07:59.881 --> 01:08:04.985]  And they told me, like, man, like, I'm here in Hollywood and, like, everybody talks about you all day.
[01:08:05.305 --> 01:08:07.426]  Or, hey, I'm here in New York, they talk about you all day.
[01:08:07.446 --> 01:08:10.348]  Or I'm here in Austin, you know, people really love you now.
[01:08:10.949 --> 01:08:11.589]  What's going on?
[01:08:12.330 --> 01:08:15.712]  And I'm like, listen, it's because we were just covering what the globalists were going to do.
[01:08:16.072 --> 01:08:17.013]  I'm not that special.
[01:08:17.813 --> 01:08:19.815]  I know that what they say they're going to do, they try to do.
[01:08:19.955 --> 01:08:23.017]  They say they want to kill 95% of the population.
[01:08:24.938 --> 01:08:26.239]  Ted Turner used to say 80%, now he says 95%.
[01:08:29.694 --> 01:08:32.436]  And they pay for textbooks teaching kids to hate themselves.
[01:08:33.837 --> 01:08:35.218]  And so they're making their move.
[01:08:35.678 --> 01:08:41.062]  And if they can get away with cutting off the resources and starving the third world and bringing us to heel, they'll do it.
[01:08:41.402 --> 01:08:44.004]  The limit of their evil is total.
[01:08:45.765 --> 01:08:48.207]  So I just want to say this as a bellwether or a gauge.
[01:08:48.287 --> 01:08:51.489]  Because I'm a very humble person and I'm way more humble than I used to be.
[01:08:51.509 --> 01:08:54.031]  Because I realize how much danger we're all in.
[01:08:54.744 --> 01:08:56.926]  I don't tell you that story to make myself sound big.
[01:08:57.026 --> 01:08:59.789]  I want you because a lot of you aren't well known or you're not famous.
[01:08:59.849 --> 01:09:00.530]  You don't see it.
[01:09:00.750 --> 01:09:01.391]  We're strong.
[01:09:02.632 --> 01:09:06.536]  And the whole globalist takeover is a move because of their weakness with the global awakening.
[01:09:06.917 --> 01:09:07.557]  I am prominent.
[01:09:07.638 --> 01:09:07.958]  I'm known.
[01:09:08.138 --> 01:09:13.744]  David Eichel tell you, when that guy had thousands come out to see him 30 years ago, he's got hundreds of thousands now.
[01:09:14.284 --> 01:09:14.545]  Okay?
[01:09:15.626 --> 01:09:17.047]  And so I'm just telling you.
[01:09:17.870 --> 01:09:26.253]  That people in government, the White House, top Fox hosts, top podcasters, you name the name, okay?
[01:09:26.913 --> 01:09:29.114]  I'm talking top Hollywood stars who I don't care about.
[01:09:29.174 --> 01:09:30.054]  They know I don't care about it.
[01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:31.775]  They don't care about it anymore.
[01:09:31.835 --> 01:09:33.315]  It's all collapsing.
[01:09:33.375 --> 01:09:34.176]  It's all gone.
[01:09:34.776 --> 01:09:36.276]  And then they say, well, what's the zeitgeist?
[01:09:36.296 --> 01:09:37.017]  Well, it's Alex Jones.
[01:09:37.077 --> 01:09:38.077]  No, you're the zeitgeist.
[01:09:38.537 --> 01:09:43.119]  And so, as negative and as bad and as scary as all of this is,
[01:09:45.583 --> 01:09:46.644]  We've been in a trance.
[01:09:46.824 --> 01:09:47.945]  Evil's really built up.
[01:09:48.125 --> 01:09:49.346]  But now the awakening's here.
[01:09:49.706 --> 01:09:51.768]  And John Rappaport will be here for the rest of the hour.
[01:09:53.329 --> 01:09:54.850]  And we've got some best of stuff coming up.
[01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:56.171]  But I've got to take three or four days off.
[01:09:57.612 --> 01:09:58.353]  I never take off.
[01:09:58.473 --> 01:09:59.313]  I don't want to take off.
[01:09:59.374 --> 01:10:00.975]  But I've got to do it to get my head straight.
[01:10:01.355 --> 01:10:03.076]  And I've got to make some decisions about what I'm going to do.
[01:10:03.437 --> 01:10:07.079]  And what I'm going to personally think people should do.
[01:10:09.326 --> 01:10:12.207]  It's going to be peaceful, but they're coming with deadly vaccines.
[01:10:12.227 --> 01:10:13.668]  They're coming with cancer viruses.
[01:10:13.688 --> 01:10:17.469]  They're coming with reprogramming, recombinant stuff for your cells, the mRNA.
[01:10:17.509 --> 01:10:18.230]  It's not a vaccine.
[01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:20.330]  It's a genetic takeover.
[01:10:20.811 --> 01:10:21.851]  They're coming with violence.
[01:10:22.191 --> 01:10:26.113]  Violating the Geneva Code, the Nuremberg Code, the Geneva Convention.
[01:10:26.153 --> 01:10:27.173]  I mean, this is real war.
[01:10:27.693 --> 01:10:31.855]  So, folks, you better get serious, and you better get on your knees, and you better talk to God.
[01:10:32.215 --> 01:10:33.436]  John Robport, we love you, brother.
[01:10:33.676 --> 01:10:34.256]  I'll be listening.
[01:10:34.596 --> 01:10:36.017]  God bless, and I hope you have a great Thanksgiving, sir.
[01:10:39.918 --> 01:10:40.298]  All right!
[01:10:41.798 --> 01:10:49.700]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:10:49.740 --> 01:10:52.721]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:10:52.801 --> 01:10:56.421]  And now, your host, John Rappaport.
[01:10:56.741 --> 01:10:58.362]  Well, quite the intro, a double intro.
[01:10:58.382 --> 01:10:59.122]  John, take it over.
[01:10:59.682 --> 01:11:01.482]  Hey, twice.
[01:11:02.043 --> 01:11:02.823]  Thank you, Alex.
[01:11:03.463 --> 01:11:04.943]  Happy Thanksgiving to you, too.
[01:11:04.963 --> 01:11:09.084]  All right, let's start with this today.
[01:11:09.795 --> 01:11:10.856]  A lot of stories here.
[01:11:12.257 --> 01:11:28.987]  Alan Joyce, the CEO of Qantas Airlines, announced a day or two ago, yes, it looks like we're going to be limiting travel to those people who get the vaccine, the COVID vaccine, when it appears, make things safe.
[01:11:29.087 --> 01:11:33.490]  And I believe that all airlines are going to follow suit, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:11:34.111 --> 01:11:34.851]  There you go.
[01:11:35.571 --> 01:11:36.532]  How did you like that?
[01:11:38.053 --> 01:11:39.434]  Let's look at that clip again.
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:40.640]  Here it is.
[01:11:41.281 --> 01:11:49.627]  Alan Joyce gets a pie in the face from a grizzled Aussie down under.
[01:11:51.729 --> 01:11:52.149]  Yeah.
[01:11:53.430 --> 01:11:53.710]  Uh-huh.
[01:11:54.531 --> 01:11:58.134]  And then he had to go change his suit and everything was okay.
[01:11:58.854 --> 01:12:00.335]  Come on, play that one again.
[01:12:01.956 --> 01:12:02.537]  Give us that
[01:12:03.553 --> 01:12:04.393]  Just a little.
[01:12:04.494 --> 01:12:04.814]  Yeah.
[01:12:04.974 --> 01:12:06.275]  Is she giving a talk?
[01:12:06.975 --> 01:12:07.355]  Yeah.
[01:12:07.795 --> 01:12:10.617]  This was not the announcement about the vaccine and travel.
[01:12:11.077 --> 01:12:14.159]  This was a later Leadership Matters speech.
[01:12:14.519 --> 01:12:16.080]  It sure does, baby.
[01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:18.441]  It sure does.
[01:12:19.862 --> 01:12:20.342]  OK.
[01:12:21.223 --> 01:12:21.543]  Now.
[01:12:22.763 --> 01:12:24.304]  Here's my follow up on that.
[01:12:26.786 --> 01:12:31.128]  The Australian powers that be are thinking, well, you know,
[01:12:32.190 --> 01:12:39.595]  If this Australian guy did not have access to pies, then we wouldn't have a problem.
[01:12:41.356 --> 01:12:54.564]  So if we take away all the pies in Australia, confiscate them, and pass a law against manufacturing or selling pies, then everything is going to be okay, right?
[01:12:55.544 --> 01:12:56.405]  Isn't that the case?
[01:12:56.945 --> 01:12:59.687]  Yeah, yes, Bob, of course it looks like the case.
[01:12:59.707 --> 01:13:01.228]  Yes, I think that's a great idea.
[01:13:01.937 --> 01:13:05.480]  Let's have a shutdown on all pies in Australia.
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:15.988]  Does that sound like anything familiar having to do with, I don't know, say, guns, which they took away in Australia some years ago?
[01:13:17.109 --> 01:13:17.909]  Indeed they do.
[01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:29.638]  So there are people pushing back, and not just with pies, because after the break I'm going to have another video, very strong video, that
[01:13:30.436 --> 01:13:33.937]  Has already been posted on Infowars, but I want everybody to see it again.
[01:13:34.898 --> 01:13:42.481]  And not only to see it, but to get it out there, to spread it all over the planet, because it's an illustration of freedom in action.
[01:13:43.441 --> 01:13:44.822]  Yeah, there's the pie again.
[01:13:46.862 --> 01:13:47.163]  So.
[01:13:48.423 --> 01:13:49.003]  Let's see.
[01:13:50.364 --> 01:13:51.744]  In the face of the pie.
[01:13:52.825 --> 01:13:54.185]  I'm looking at my notes here.
[01:13:56.026 --> 01:13:58.307]  I hope you know that five sheriffs
[01:13:59.389 --> 01:14:16.476]  In prominent counties in Southern California, population total 17 million, which I believe would make it the sixth most populous state in the Union, have refused to enforce Governor Newsom's curfew, new curfew order.
[01:14:17.536 --> 01:14:18.817]  They're not going to do it.
[01:14:18.877 --> 01:14:26.720]  That's five sheriffs in five major counties like Orange County and so forth in Los Angeles area.
[01:14:27.791 --> 01:14:33.576]  Not going to enforce this mandate from the governor.
[01:14:34.336 --> 01:14:38.640]  And a recall is in progress against Governor Newsom.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.041]  And it's gaining steam.
[01:14:41.762 --> 01:14:44.604]  They're getting lots and lots of signatures for it.
[01:14:45.065 --> 01:14:46.205]  It's happening, folks.
[01:14:47.186 --> 01:14:51.109]  Because even the liberals in California can see the hypocrisy.
[01:14:51.189 --> 01:14:55.733]  Because people have caught Newsom out there having dinner,
[01:14:56.587 --> 01:14:59.968]  With friends violating his own order.
[01:15:01.449 --> 01:15:05.091]  There was a conference in Hawaii, etc, etc, etc.
[01:15:05.951 --> 01:15:16.035]  So the guy is an idiot, moron, a predator, a traitor, and he's the governor of California.
[01:15:17.556 --> 01:15:18.536]  People are waking up.
[01:15:18.656 --> 01:15:19.257]  They're seeing it.
[01:15:19.277 --> 01:15:20.297]  They're understanding it.
[01:15:22.598 --> 01:15:24.899]  As Alex just said, even
[01:15:25.902 --> 01:15:35.908]  The elite liberals realize that the whole system is crashing and collapsing around them, and it's not going to be kind to them.
[01:15:37.809 --> 01:15:40.911]  Oh, we thought we were immune from the whole deal.
[01:15:41.312 --> 01:15:43.073]  We thought we were above the system.
[01:15:43.133 --> 01:15:50.477]  We thought we were above the left, which we pledge our allegiance to, but it turns out not the case.
[01:15:51.058 --> 01:15:53.639]  It looks like we may be going down as well.
[01:15:53.659 --> 01:15:54.920]  Well, that's not okay.
[01:15:55.822 --> 01:15:56.322]  Stay tuned.
[01:15:56.462 --> 01:15:58.623]  We'll be back after the break with more pie.
[01:16:00.083 --> 01:16:01.944]  You know, something very sad is happening.
[01:16:01.984 --> 01:16:08.186]  It's very sad because it was all avoidable two and a half years ago when Infowars got banned off of more than 60 major platforms.
[01:16:08.766 --> 01:16:24.112]  I warn everybody there was a precedent for the upcoming presidential election and that they would continue to ratchet down and tighten down the censorship until effectively there was a total internet kill switch in place against conservatives, nationals, and populists.
[01:16:24.232 --> 01:16:24.952]  And now that's happened.
[01:16:25.552 --> 01:16:39.119]  And then I told everybody that they would then start moving to arrest individuals that demonstrate and protest using a second COVID-19 lockdown, and that Trump needed to get out front and fully repudiate COVID-19 as basically an overblown hoax.
[01:16:39.639 --> 01:16:46.302]  He started to do that in the last few months of the campaign, but we have to understand that that's the pincer attack they're going to use.
[01:16:46.683 --> 01:16:54.527]  They're going to use Black Lives Matter and race war to stir up the American people and divide us, and they're going to use economic warfare, shutting down the economy, to try to control us.
[01:16:55.427 --> 01:16:59.633]  I hope people will listen now to my warnings because I'm on air telling people what's coming next.
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:08.345]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Root Supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:17:08.585 --> 01:17:18.790]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[01:17:19.131 --> 01:17:28.776]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[01:17:29.116 --> 01:17:34.838]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[01:17:35.078 --> 01:17:39.640]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[01:17:39.941 --> 01:17:48.124]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to,
[01:17:48.544 --> 01:17:52.347]  German Chamomile, Organic Skullcap, and Bavarian Root.
[01:17:52.627 --> 01:17:59.872]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:17:59.992 --> 01:18:03.534]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[01:18:03.854 --> 01:18:07.837]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[01:18:08.177 --> 01:18:16.683]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:18:17.023 --> 01:18:33.315]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[01:18:33.635 --> 01:18:44.683]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[01:18:45.163 --> 01:18:53.375]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[01:18:53.655 --> 01:18:59.223]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:19:00.816 --> 01:19:05.498]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes of the two.
[01:19:05.978 --> 01:19:08.379]  One is born of renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[01:19:09.019 --> 01:19:17.402]  One bases its power on having a strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity and art and skill and strength.
[01:19:18.083 --> 01:19:23.465]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it.
[01:19:24.445 --> 01:19:32.010]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[01:19:32.551 --> 01:19:35.733]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[01:19:36.153 --> 01:19:40.416]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:42.737]  A global permanent lockdown is here.
[01:19:43.378 --> 01:19:45.600]  It's already causing millions and millions to starve to death.
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:47.741]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[01:19:48.302 --> 01:19:55.967]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[01:19:56.147 --> 01:19:56.828]  That's the facts.
[01:19:56.848 --> 01:19:58.949]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:09.017]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:23.236 --> 01:20:43.212]  Okay, now I want to set up here, I want to set up the next video here, which is much longer and I want to play the whole thing.
[01:20:45.233 --> 01:20:48.136]  This happened in Buffalo a few days ago.
[01:20:49.817 --> 01:20:52.099]  A small gym worked out
[01:20:53.271 --> 01:20:54.652]  Pumping iron, whatever.
[01:20:55.552 --> 01:20:56.973]  Looks like it happened at night.
[01:20:59.494 --> 01:21:02.835]  There's about, I don't know, six, seven people in the gym, it looks like.
[01:21:02.955 --> 01:21:03.556]  Maybe more.
[01:21:03.596 --> 01:21:04.656]  We don't see them all.
[01:21:05.716 --> 01:21:11.579]  I'm presuming the gym owners are there and a few friends, clients, whatever.
[01:21:12.339 --> 01:21:14.340]  Obviously, some complaint went out.
[01:21:15.621 --> 01:21:16.601]  The cops arrived.
[01:21:16.661 --> 01:21:19.943]  These are sheriff's people and a public health officer.
[01:21:20.023 --> 01:21:20.463]  Hold on.
[01:21:21.078 --> 01:21:23.260]  Don't start the video yet.
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:25.221]  I want to get this whole thing.
[01:21:26.542 --> 01:21:26.903]  Okay.
[01:21:29.004 --> 01:21:30.305]  This is a confrontation.
[01:21:31.426 --> 01:21:50.281]  This is like three or four of the cops, the sheriff's people, and a public health officer that think that they're going to have an easy time to roll over these people in the gym because there's too many of them, they're exceeding the limit, or they're not wearing masks or whatever.
[01:21:51.246 --> 01:21:57.010]  But something else happens entirely, and I want you to watch it and listen to the audio.
[01:21:57.430 --> 01:21:59.051]  Let's play the whole thing now.
[01:21:59.332 --> 01:21:59.752]  Here we go.
[01:22:01.661 --> 01:22:02.762]  You're on private property.
[01:22:02.842 --> 01:22:03.363]  You need to leave.
[01:22:03.843 --> 01:22:05.304]  We're asking to build your compassion inside.
[01:22:05.344 --> 01:22:06.165]  I know you're a taxpayer.
[01:22:06.305 --> 01:22:08.307]  You know, our tax dollars guarantee your guys' paychecks.
[01:22:08.327 --> 01:22:12.511]  But some of these people actually work for their money, and they don't want to lose their livelihood.
[01:22:13.012 --> 01:22:15.954]  I've lost friends, I've lost family, who've killed themselves.
[01:22:15.994 --> 01:22:18.677]  I've seen clients die because they've lost their livelihood.
[01:22:19.297 --> 01:22:20.118]  I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:22:20.198 --> 01:22:25.183]  I know you are, and I'm asking for you to guys have some compassion for the people that have lost everything.
[01:22:25.814 --> 01:22:27.676]  We do have compassion for people who lost everything.
[01:22:27.696 --> 01:22:29.718]  Okay, well you need to go have compassion out in the parking lot.
[01:22:29.858 --> 01:22:30.960]  This is private property.
[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:32.822]  This is private property.
[01:22:33.222 --> 01:22:34.524]  This is private property.
[01:22:34.544 --> 01:22:36.185]  It's private property.
[01:22:36.205 --> 01:22:37.086]  Go get a warrant.
[01:22:37.387 --> 01:22:37.927]  Listen, man.
[01:22:38.188 --> 01:22:39.109]  This is private property.
[01:22:39.129 --> 01:22:39.989]  You're not wanted here.
[01:22:40.350 --> 01:22:41.992]  So, do your jobs.
[01:22:42.412 --> 01:22:46.454]  Well, her job is... Well, no, no, your job is to remove people that are not wanted here.
[01:22:46.594 --> 01:22:47.335]  We're wanted here.
[01:22:47.615 --> 01:22:48.055]  They're not.
[01:22:48.255 --> 01:22:49.376]  She's hiding her name tag.
[01:22:49.396 --> 01:22:50.156]  She had her name tag.
[01:22:50.336 --> 01:22:50.536]  I'm not.
[01:22:50.596 --> 01:22:51.137]  It's right here.
[01:22:51.417 --> 01:22:51.897]  It's right here.
[01:22:51.917 --> 01:22:52.737]  You can see my name tag.
[01:22:52.757 --> 01:22:53.638]  They're just doing their job.
[01:22:53.658 --> 01:22:54.058]  There we go.
[01:22:54.258 --> 01:22:55.299]  You shouldn't be wearing masks.
[01:22:55.399 --> 01:22:56.720]  I'm not doing anything wrong.
[01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:57.920]  Don't worry about my health.
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:22:59.261]  My health is in your concern.
[01:22:59.281 --> 01:23:00.321]  You're meant to be wearing a mask.
[01:23:00.341 --> 01:23:01.822]  It's a government... Okay, well, then write me up.
[01:23:01.902 --> 01:23:02.523]  It's the law.
[01:23:02.623 --> 01:23:04.303]  Okay, then take me to jail.
[01:23:04.323 --> 01:23:05.344]  It's not the law.
[01:23:05.364 --> 01:23:06.184]  Then take me to jail.
[01:23:06.385 --> 01:23:08.005]  It's not the law.
[01:23:08.065 --> 01:23:09.086]  Show me the law.
[01:23:09.186 --> 01:23:10.167]  Show me the law.
[01:23:10.207 --> 01:23:10.807]  Show me the law.
[01:23:11.407 --> 01:23:13.208]  Well, I think we've got to go, John.
[01:23:13.248 --> 01:23:14.369]  You have to leave, you guys.
[01:23:14.409 --> 01:23:15.870]  You guys have to leave.
[01:23:15.950 --> 01:23:16.730]  You have to leave.
[01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:18.411]  Right now, you're trespassing without a warrant.
[01:23:18.691 --> 01:23:19.932]  You're trespassing.
[01:23:19.972 --> 01:23:21.333]  We're not trespassing.
[01:23:21.393 --> 01:23:22.894]  You're trespassing.
[01:23:22.994 --> 01:23:23.794]  It doesn't matter.
[01:23:23.814 --> 01:23:25.195]  We have a right to be here.
[01:23:25.335 --> 01:23:27.276]  Go get a warrant.
[01:23:27.316 --> 01:23:28.277]  Go get a warrant.
[01:23:28.357 --> 01:23:29.057]  Yes, you do.
[01:23:29.237 --> 01:23:30.638]  Come back with a warrant or leave.
[01:23:30.658 --> 01:23:31.559]  You don't write the law.
[01:23:31.579 --> 01:23:33.300]  So you can walk on any property with no warrant?
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:34.920]  Go get a warrant.
[01:23:34.940 --> 01:23:36.301]  You guys are breaking the law right now.
[01:23:36.521 --> 01:23:37.161]  You're breaking the law.
[01:23:37.541 --> 01:23:38.101]  Go outside.
[01:23:38.141 --> 01:23:39.842]  No, go on your phone outside.
[01:23:39.922 --> 01:23:41.262]  Go on your phone outside.
[01:23:41.282 --> 01:23:44.183]  I would really like it if you stopped filming me.
[01:23:44.243 --> 01:23:45.004]  I have my DNA.
[01:23:45.084 --> 01:23:47.564]  Okay, we're going to look at the law.
[01:23:47.584 --> 01:23:49.825]  We're going to look at the law.
[01:23:49.865 --> 01:23:50.105]  Leave!
[01:23:50.265 --> 01:23:50.365]  Leave!
[01:23:50.385 --> 01:23:51.046]  Who reported it?
[01:23:51.386 --> 01:23:52.086]  Who reported it?
[01:23:52.898 --> 01:23:53.338]  You know what?
[01:23:53.638 --> 01:23:54.478]  I don't know.
[01:23:54.638 --> 01:23:55.699]  It's anonymous, right?
[01:23:55.759 --> 01:23:56.479]  It's anonymous.
[01:23:56.579 --> 01:23:57.839]  It can't be anonymous.
[01:23:57.859 --> 01:23:59.400]  You need to know your accuser.
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:00.060]  You need to know.
[01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:00.920]  It cannot be anonymous.
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:01.800]  You gotta go get a warrant.
[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:03.121]  It cannot be anonymous.
[01:24:03.161 --> 01:24:04.601]  You gotta go get a warrant.
[01:24:04.641 --> 01:24:06.442]  You don't get to write the policies.
[01:24:06.462 --> 01:24:08.402]  You don't get to violate the Constitution.
[01:24:08.422 --> 01:24:09.523]  It does not matter.
[01:24:09.663 --> 01:24:12.663]  You don't circumvent or subvert the Constitution.
[01:24:12.703 --> 01:24:14.944]  That's the way it works.
[01:24:15.784 --> 01:24:16.284]  Call the noose.
[01:24:17.085 --> 01:24:18.185]  Okay, Meth, you need to leave.
[01:24:18.205 --> 01:24:18.685]  Get out!
[01:24:18.745 --> 01:24:19.625]  Get out!

[01:25:07.587 --> 01:25:10.969]  We've got to get off the property.
[01:25:11.269 --> 01:25:11.829]  Off the property.
[01:25:11.849 --> 01:25:13.270]  You're not welcome here.
[01:25:13.650 --> 01:25:15.070]  This is a Black Lives Matter protest.
[01:25:15.090 --> 01:25:16.211]  You've got to go to the road.
[01:25:16.291 --> 01:25:17.671]  You've got to go to the road.
[01:25:17.751 --> 01:25:19.572]  We will not comply!
[01:25:19.592 --> 01:25:22.013]  We will not comply!
[01:25:22.033 --> 01:25:24.434]  We will not comply!
[01:25:25.134 --> 01:25:27.075]  We will not comply!
[01:25:27.095 --> 01:25:29.435]  We will not comply!
[01:25:29.476 --> 01:25:31.936]  This is a protest, guys.
[01:25:31.976 --> 01:25:33.757]  We do not have to disband.
[01:25:34.197 --> 01:25:35.598]  It is a protest.
[01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:38.819]  This is a lawful protest.
[01:25:39.659 --> 01:25:41.600]  We will not comply!
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:44.080]  We will not comply!
[01:25:44.100 --> 01:25:46.621]  We will not comply!
[01:25:47.322 --> 01:25:49.042]  We will not comply!
[01:25:52.771 --> 01:25:54.112]  To the road!
[01:25:54.172 --> 01:25:54.773]  To the road!
[01:26:01.118 --> 01:26:10.766]  And they are breaking the law.
[01:26:11.367 --> 01:26:16.371]  This will be a good radio show for you.
[01:26:16.451 --> 01:26:17.632]  The New Age Nazis is what they are.
[01:26:21.701 --> 01:26:24.163]  All right.
[01:26:24.243 --> 01:26:25.564]  We're still going on here.
[01:26:25.604 --> 01:26:27.365]  Still going on on this video.
[01:26:28.466 --> 01:26:29.927]  They're pushing them out.
[01:26:30.007 --> 01:26:30.908]  You can see that.
[01:26:32.208 --> 01:26:33.189]  See what happened there?
[01:26:35.230 --> 01:26:37.032]  Understand what that is?
[01:26:37.112 --> 01:26:38.132]  What's going on there?
[01:26:38.633 --> 01:26:40.594]  They're not just pushing them out of the gym.
[01:26:41.094 --> 01:26:43.656]  They're pushing them off the property.
[01:26:44.837 --> 01:26:47.018]  Take your commie shit elsewhere!
[01:26:47.779 --> 01:26:49.360]  They came onto the property.
[01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:49.820]  Okay.
[01:26:51.164 --> 01:26:52.145]  And now they're gone.
[01:26:53.486 --> 01:27:18.222]  Now, if this video gets all over the world, all over the world, and people begin to see what happened there in Buffalo, New York, with these people, these people who just said no, that's it, to those people that you're watching there in the picture, what do you think that would do?
[01:27:19.721 --> 01:27:28.327]  Let's say 30 million, 40 million more people see this video and they wake up a little bit or a lot.
[01:27:28.407 --> 01:27:34.531]  They start realizing, wow, you know, this is not exactly what I thought it was.
[01:27:35.672 --> 01:27:37.253]  This whole COVID nightmare.
[01:27:38.574 --> 01:27:42.897]  People who are on the fence, people who don't know, people who aren't sure, what should I do?
[01:27:43.337 --> 01:27:44.118]  How should I think?
[01:27:44.418 --> 01:27:45.439]  How should I look at this?
[01:27:45.539 --> 01:27:46.780]  Whatever, whatever, whatever.
[01:27:47.836 --> 01:28:00.165]  The freedom fire that is in every human being, no matter who they are, begins to emerge when they see these people, these, what do you call them?
[01:28:00.705 --> 01:28:08.370]  Americans, patriots, heroes, standing up and saying, no, that's not going to happen.
[01:28:09.111 --> 01:28:09.651]  Get out.
[01:28:12.013 --> 01:28:13.754]  That fire begins to burn.
[01:28:16.089 --> 01:28:17.910]  That freedom begins to take hold.
[01:28:19.191 --> 01:28:22.252]  People begin to remember where they came from.
[01:28:23.493 --> 01:28:24.193]  What they're about.
[01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:28.556]  It's one more log on the fire of freedom.
[01:28:29.616 --> 01:28:36.300]  If you share this video and it goes out to millions of people around the world and they see it.
[01:28:37.901 --> 01:28:41.142]  Some people say, well, yeah, but you can't do this with other kinds of cops.
[01:28:41.162 --> 01:28:42.883]  You can't do it in all kinds of situations.
[01:28:43.003 --> 01:28:43.484]  Shut up.
[01:28:44.824 --> 01:28:45.745]  Shut up.
[01:28:47.952 --> 01:28:49.473]  That's not what I'm talking about.
[01:28:50.113 --> 01:28:57.615]  I'm talking about the inspiration for freedom that these people just seen here, that you saw, provided.
[01:28:57.715 --> 01:28:58.556]  We'll be right back.
[01:28:59.856 --> 01:29:06.618]  You gotta get the turbo force, you gotta get your B12, you gotta get your fish oil, the turmeric.
[01:29:07.118 --> 01:29:08.059]  This changed my life.
[01:29:08.779 --> 01:29:13.361]  My work, I work construction man, and the turbo force has helped me a lot.
[01:29:15.081 --> 01:29:17.202]  Turmeric's helped me tremendous.
[01:29:18.062 --> 01:29:19.642]  I support everything you guys do.
[01:29:19.742 --> 01:29:20.383]  You guys are great.
[01:29:20.423 --> 01:29:21.103]  We love you, man.
[01:29:21.123 --> 01:29:21.483]  We love you.
[01:29:21.503 --> 01:29:22.303]  Keep up the good work.
[01:29:22.543 --> 01:29:22.823]  Thank you.
[01:29:22.843 --> 01:29:23.884]  Show us your flagpole, bro.
[01:29:23.944 --> 01:29:24.364]  Yeah, brother.

[01:29:25.744 --> 01:29:26.424]  I snapped it.
[01:29:26.604 --> 01:29:27.185]  It's alright.

[01:29:46.566 --> 01:29:47.667]  And we appreciate you.

[01:32:00.509 --> 01:32:06.373]  If you act now, we'll throw in this free CD collection of BLM's greatest hits!
[01:32:06.613 --> 01:32:11.817]  Sing along with all the woke BLM chants like Oink Oink, Bang Bang!
[01:32:11.837 --> 01:32:12.958]  Oink Oink, Bang Bang!
[01:32:12.998 --> 01:32:14.078]  Oink Oink, Bang Bang!
[01:32:14.098 --> 01:32:17.101]  No borders, no wall, no USA at all!
[01:32:17.261 --> 01:32:20.323]  No borders, no wall, no USA at all!
[01:32:20.985 --> 01:32:22.667]  Hey man, is that Black Lives Matter?
[01:32:22.687 --> 01:32:23.788]  Hell yeah!
[01:32:23.888 --> 01:32:24.929]  We'll turn it up!
[01:32:26.190 --> 01:32:29.313]  Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon.
[01:32:29.373 --> 01:32:31.755]  Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon.
[01:32:31.855 --> 01:32:35.018]  In their brand new hit single, You're Jesus.
[01:32:35.058 --> 01:32:36.720]  You're Jesus.
[01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:38.722]  You know the words, sing along.
[01:32:41.024 --> 01:32:45.627]  So order your copy today and get woke with Black Lives Matter.
[01:32:46.007 --> 01:32:47.929]  Now accepting EBT cards.
[01:32:47.969 --> 01:32:52.552]  Order before November 3rd and get this free Trump T-shirt for toddlers.
[01:32:53.092 --> 01:32:55.074]  Get woke with Black Lives Matter.
[01:33:02.379 --> 01:33:06.482]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:07.002 --> 01:33:08.283]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:16.736 --> 01:33:28.400]  Okay, here we're back.
[01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:34.142]  So, you get the picture from that video that we just showed at Buffalo.
[01:33:34.882 --> 01:33:41.324]  These are guys, people in the gym, that just said no, you know?
[01:33:42.458 --> 01:33:44.839]  I mean, it wasn't planned.
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:49.982]  It wasn't like, OK, now when the cops are coming, etc.
[01:33:50.042 --> 01:33:50.362]  No, no.
[01:33:50.782 --> 01:33:52.943]  Cops walked in, public health officer.
[01:33:54.784 --> 01:33:56.425]  Freedom kicked in.
[01:33:58.206 --> 01:34:03.989]  And these guys were tough enough to put it right there on the line to the cops.
[01:34:04.669 --> 01:34:05.590]  It's private property.
[01:34:05.630 --> 01:34:05.990]  Get out.
[01:34:06.290 --> 01:34:07.090]  They drove him out.
[01:34:07.551 --> 01:34:08.831]  They drove him out of the gym.
[01:34:09.272 --> 01:34:10.752]  They drove him out of the parking lot.
[01:34:10.792 --> 01:34:12.133]  They drove him off the property.
[01:34:14.775 --> 01:34:15.816]  That means something.
[01:34:16.976 --> 01:34:17.657]  That's the point.
[01:34:18.597 --> 01:34:19.557]  That means something.
[01:34:20.118 --> 01:34:24.180]  That cuts through a lot of fog, is my point.
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:30.223]  And I'm going to press this point, in as many ways as I possibly can.
[01:34:32.144 --> 01:34:34.705]  There they go, off the property, or out of the gym.
[01:34:35.246 --> 01:34:38.587]  And they follow them, and they follow them all the way off the property.
[01:34:40.488 --> 01:34:41.669]  Freedom kicks in.
[01:34:43.413 --> 01:34:45.114]  It's kicking in all over the world.
[01:34:46.735 --> 01:34:48.937]  Major media is not covering it, of course.
[01:34:49.777 --> 01:34:52.419]  There are protests across Europe now.
[01:34:52.559 --> 01:34:53.780]  Momentous events.
[01:34:54.961 --> 01:35:00.765]  Italy, Poland, Spain, Germany, France, UK.
[01:35:03.607 --> 01:35:04.147]  Happening.
[01:35:04.567 --> 01:35:05.868]  Large numbers of people.
[01:35:06.449 --> 01:35:08.730]  These are COVID lockdown protests.
[01:35:09.311 --> 01:35:10.091]  You're killing us.
[01:35:10.131 --> 01:35:11.512]  You're destroying the economy.
[01:35:11.552 --> 01:35:12.693]  You're destroying the country.
[01:35:13.151 --> 01:35:14.792]  You're telling us we can't come out.
[01:35:15.132 --> 01:35:16.893]  You're telling us we can't go back to work.
[01:35:16.933 --> 01:35:17.133]  Yeah.
[01:35:17.493 --> 01:35:19.374]  Look at that little protest on the screen.
[01:35:19.414 --> 01:35:19.894]  What is that?
[01:35:19.954 --> 01:35:22.015]  Like maybe 500,000 people there?
[01:35:22.896 --> 01:35:23.256]  You know?
[01:35:24.896 --> 01:35:27.378]  You think NBC is interested or CBS?
[01:35:27.818 --> 01:35:34.941]  Yeah, they're interested in blacking it out and censoring it because that means freedom.
[01:35:35.822 --> 01:35:37.562]  That crowd means freedom.
[01:35:38.183 --> 01:35:39.963]  These people are fed up.
[01:35:40.044 --> 01:35:40.904]  They've had enough.
[01:35:41.798 --> 01:35:44.839]  So here come the water cannons being shot at them.
[01:35:45.319 --> 01:35:48.739]  But it's futile because there's too many of those people there.
[01:35:49.259 --> 01:35:51.320]  They're not going to disperse the whole crowd.
[01:35:54.680 --> 01:36:05.382]  These people, just like the people who stopped the steal in Washington, whatever it was, several hundred thousand or more, want freedom.
[01:36:07.002 --> 01:36:08.583]  That's what they're looking for.
[01:36:09.423 --> 01:36:11.123]  That's the impulse they feel.
[01:36:13.086 --> 01:36:15.747]  You put somebody in jail, they want freedom.
[01:36:16.247 --> 01:36:20.948]  That's what these people in all these European protests are talking about.
[01:36:20.988 --> 01:36:30.930]  That's what the five sheriffs in Southern California are talking about when they say, we're not going to enforce this curfew by the governor.
[01:36:31.350 --> 01:36:31.950]  Are you kidding?
[01:36:31.970 --> 01:36:35.711]  17 million people there in those five counties.
[01:36:39.071 --> 01:36:42.092]  But there's you, there's me, there's everybody else.
[01:36:43.089 --> 01:36:48.253]  There's nobody that doesn't have that impulse for freedom.
[01:36:49.934 --> 01:36:51.515]  To get out of jail.
[01:36:52.196 --> 01:36:53.357]  It's that obvious.
[01:36:53.737 --> 01:36:55.098]  To get out of jail.
[01:36:56.980 --> 01:36:58.060]  COVID lockdowns.
[01:36:58.961 --> 01:36:59.942]  What about the churches?
[01:37:01.263 --> 01:37:02.264]  What about the churches?
[01:37:03.264 --> 01:37:05.926]  Churches are supposed to be separate from the state, aren't they?
[01:37:06.467 --> 01:37:08.388]  Separation of church and state.
[01:37:08.548 --> 01:37:09.209]  Oh, wait a minute.
[01:37:09.949 --> 01:37:20.012]  They're all 501c3 non-profit corporations now in the United States, therefore they're beholden to the government?
[01:37:21.112 --> 01:37:23.573]  I don't think that's what the Constitution had in mind.
[01:37:23.593 --> 01:37:28.175]  The Constitution had in mind religious freedom.
[01:37:29.195 --> 01:37:31.696]  The freedom to practice religion.
[01:37:32.816 --> 01:37:33.596]  What does that mean?
[01:37:34.477 --> 01:37:38.998]  The freedom to connect with God, with a higher power.
[01:37:39.545 --> 01:37:49.952]  With whatever people are connecting with of a higher nature by their own definition and decision.
[01:37:53.154 --> 01:37:53.514]  Freedom.
[01:37:55.616 --> 01:37:57.457]  Oh, but no, you're going to have to shut down the churches.
[01:37:57.497 --> 01:37:58.498]  You can't come out of the church.
[01:37:58.518 --> 01:37:59.839]  You can't go into the churches.
[01:37:59.879 --> 01:38:01.220]  You can't come out of the churches.
[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:02.861]  Churches are closed.
[01:38:03.061 --> 01:38:03.561]  No freedom.
[01:38:05.322 --> 01:38:09.305]  Well, people all over the country are rebelling and all over the world are rebelling against that.
[01:38:10.993 --> 01:38:20.898]  I get reports, not just of churches, I get reports of pockets of the economy all over the United States that are wide open.
[01:38:22.459 --> 01:38:23.359]  I mean wide open.
[01:38:24.700 --> 01:38:28.102]  They're not making a big deal of it, but they're wide open.
[01:38:28.142 --> 01:38:31.424]  No masks, no distancing, packed restaurants.
[01:38:31.924 --> 01:38:32.504]  It's happening.
[01:38:32.824 --> 01:38:40.008]  People are ignoring the lockdowns, the mandates, the restrictions, all of this insanity that's being lowered.
[01:38:40.797 --> 01:38:45.440]  On the population's head in the name of some kind of virus.
[01:38:47.881 --> 01:38:49.002]  People are ignoring that.
[01:38:49.562 --> 01:38:50.643]  They're going back to work.
[01:38:53.905 --> 01:38:57.647]  We've got to open the economy every which way we can.
[01:38:58.668 --> 01:39:03.351]  Above ground, underground, sideways, upside down, inside out, whatever it is.
[01:39:04.412 --> 01:39:07.093]  During the Great Depression of the 1930s, I'm told there were 3,000
[01:39:10.422 --> 01:39:17.608]  Local currencies, money, issued by people in different communities around the United States.
[01:39:18.749 --> 01:39:30.197]  These were efforts to bypass the federal money system, which had been collapsed momentarily in order to create Great Depression, intentionally.
[01:39:32.419 --> 01:39:35.181]  Open the economy every which way you can.
[01:39:35.722 --> 01:39:37.183]  The freedom impulse
[01:39:38.416 --> 01:39:40.938]  That's what they want to squash with the masks.
[01:39:42.218 --> 01:40:00.009]  They want to keep the lockdowns and the masks going long enough so that an overwhelming number of people shuffle along a bleak road to death with no willpower, no determination, no ambition, no energy left, no spirit.
[01:40:00.949 --> 01:40:03.071]  No spirit of what?
[01:40:03.251 --> 01:40:03.711]  Of freedom.
[01:40:04.884 --> 01:40:09.589]  You could say of patriotism, of American freedom, of their own freedom.
[01:40:10.009 --> 01:40:12.091]  I mean, isn't that what it comes down to?
[01:40:13.192 --> 01:40:15.815]  Your own freedom, everybody's freedom.
[01:40:17.096 --> 01:40:26.105]  Natural freedom that predates any government formation or constitution or structure.
[01:40:27.487 --> 01:40:28.888]  Isn't that what it comes down to?
[01:40:32.859 --> 01:40:48.932]  And what you're seeing take shape in the would be, could be, maybe Biden administration is exactly that crushing of the soul and the spirit and freedom.
[01:40:49.812 --> 01:41:00.781]  If we make enough people shuffle along enough bleak streets, long enough wearing their masks, hiding out behind their masks in fear,
[01:41:03.177 --> 01:41:18.045]  If we lock them down long enough in their homes and destroy their ability to work and bankrupt enough of their small and medium-sized businesses and shut them down, we destroy their will.
[01:41:18.946 --> 01:41:20.326]  Their will to freedom.
[01:41:20.867 --> 01:41:22.087]  Their will to live.
[01:41:22.547 --> 01:41:23.948]  Their will to thrive.
[01:41:24.549 --> 01:41:32.473]  Their will to strive for what they want in their lives, independent of what the friggin' government wants.
[01:41:34.943 --> 01:41:35.984]  That's where they're going.
[01:41:36.784 --> 01:41:38.145]  That's where they're going now.
[01:41:38.665 --> 01:41:40.006]  That's where they've been going.
[01:41:43.007 --> 01:41:44.348]  They want to accelerate it.
[01:41:45.369 --> 01:41:47.530]  They want the darkest of dark winters.
[01:41:50.952 --> 01:41:52.773]  But freedom doesn't die.
[01:41:53.613 --> 01:41:55.514]  I've got a news flash for you.
[01:41:56.695 --> 01:41:58.516]  Freedom does not die.
[01:41:59.897 --> 01:42:02.298]  Even in people who think it's dying.
[01:42:03.163 --> 01:42:11.688]  There comes a make-break point where things get bad enough, and that impulse kicks in for that person, that impulse to freedom.
[01:42:12.049 --> 01:42:25.077]  And no matter what they're saying, no matter what they're doing, no matter what political party they're in, or what they say about the election, or anything, or whatever, oh, I want this and that and we all have to obey and whatever, all of that suddenly goes away.
[01:42:27.398 --> 01:42:31.501]  And now, the fire of freedom comes forward.
[01:42:32.825 --> 01:42:33.505]  It's there.
[01:42:33.965 --> 01:42:35.086]  It's undeniable.
[01:42:35.566 --> 01:42:36.486]  It takes over.
[01:42:37.046 --> 01:42:43.008]  Like an involuntary reflex on behalf of survival, it takes over.
[01:42:45.389 --> 01:42:56.173]  And that's why I want that video of what happened in Buffalo to go worldwide to 50, 100 million people, so they see what that freedom looks like up close and personal.
[01:42:56.713 --> 01:42:57.893]  Stay with us, we'll be back.
[01:42:59.814 --> 01:43:00.594]  When President Trump
[01:43:02.108 --> 01:43:03.088]  It really is simple.
[01:43:03.248 --> 01:43:04.909]  The left are into being deviant.
[01:43:04.929 --> 01:43:06.689]  And I don't mean sexually deviant.
[01:43:06.749 --> 01:43:08.170]  That goes to the territory.
[01:43:08.910 --> 01:43:15.152]  I'm talking about deviant against their ancestors, deviant against their own species, deviant against the order of nature.
[01:43:15.872 --> 01:43:20.493]  Even though that deviance is destructive and poisonous, they still do it because they want to play God.
[01:43:20.633 --> 01:43:22.754]  Everything they touch, they destroy.
[01:43:22.834 --> 01:43:27.115]  Their sacrament is aborting babies and then using their body parts.
[01:43:27.555 --> 01:43:31.056]  Their religion is not taking care of the old, but euthanizing them.
[01:43:31.596 --> 01:43:40.459]  Their whole system is designed for the UN to keep third world countries in serious poverty and poor, ballooning populations, and then watching all that new fruit die on the vine.
[01:43:40.959 --> 01:43:45.481]  To continually reproduce the same nightmares over and over and over again.
[01:43:45.521 --> 01:43:47.282]  They truly are the children of Satan.
[01:43:47.322 --> 01:43:48.282]  They are the children of the devil.
[01:43:48.602 --> 01:43:55.004]  And if you look at the slaves that served Biden and Kamala Harris, it really is manifest that being a slave of Satan is not profitable.
[01:43:55.524 --> 01:43:56.785]  Sin is not profitable.
[01:43:57.185 --> 01:43:59.406]  I'm Alex Jones, and this is the InfoWar.

[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:15.091]  Election 2020 is here, and whether Trump wins or loses, we have all won by exposing the Communist Chinese, by exposing the globalists, by exposing the pedophile rings, by exposing the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil.
[01:46:15.812 --> 01:46:19.835]  Now, I'm personally a Christian, and I believe in God, and I know God's real, and I've experienced it in my life.
[01:46:20.395 --> 01:46:25.159]  But even if you don't believe in God, it's important to recognize that there is good in this world, there is evil.
[01:46:25.679 --> 01:46:28.921]  And there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing bad.
[01:46:29.862 --> 01:46:39.046]  And what I see happening across the spectrum of different political views is people finally get that, they finally understand that they're not being naive anymore.
[01:46:39.746 --> 01:46:46.049]  Don't ever project your decency and your goodness onto other people until they've proven what they say.
[01:46:46.209 --> 01:46:46.929]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:47:21.323 --> 01:47:25.604]  Back here for the last segment.
[01:47:26.225 --> 01:47:27.505]  Freedom.
[01:47:28.625 --> 01:47:29.446]  It's an impulse.
[01:47:30.646 --> 01:47:32.046]  It's like the need for food.
[01:47:34.587 --> 01:47:36.027]  Baby reaches out for food.
[01:47:36.208 --> 01:47:37.588]  Person reaches out for freedom.
[01:47:38.308 --> 01:47:39.128]  Healthy freedom.
[01:47:39.949 --> 01:47:44.830]  Not the freedom to go crazy and insane and destroy and loot, burn and all that.
[01:47:47.631 --> 01:47:48.251]  Healthy freedom.
[01:47:49.130 --> 01:47:51.832]  To look around and say, I'm alive.
[01:47:54.273 --> 01:47:57.775]  What do I want to do now that I know I'm alive?
[01:47:58.335 --> 01:47:59.056]  This is life.
[01:48:00.537 --> 01:48:02.158]  This is my choice.
[01:48:02.198 --> 01:48:03.338]  This is my ambition.
[01:48:03.358 --> 01:48:11.944]  I'm going to put my energy and will and determination and intelligence and creativity into this life to do what I want to do.
[01:48:12.084 --> 01:48:17.727]  I'm living in a system or a society or a country where I can do that.
[01:48:19.901 --> 01:48:22.582]  Until you're not.
[01:48:24.882 --> 01:48:29.163]  But long before that happens, you know, let's face it, okay?
[01:48:29.463 --> 01:48:31.883]  Let's just talk here between the two of us.
[01:48:32.784 --> 01:48:34.804]  We know that certain things creep in.
[01:48:35.344 --> 01:48:49.687]  They creep in in all kinds of ways from all different sources in school and training and jobs and so on and so forth to kind of put a lid, a buffer on that freedom, on that healthy, strong, powerful, outgoing,
[01:48:50.464 --> 01:48:50.844]  Freedom.
[01:48:52.544 --> 01:49:06.827]  So that by the time fascists, scum, come along with serious programs to destroy that freedom, it's already being camped down to some degree in most people already.
[01:49:09.088 --> 01:49:11.448]  But then the real heavyweights come along.
[01:49:13.749 --> 01:49:14.569]  What's their story?
[01:49:14.609 --> 01:49:15.349]  They hate freedom.
[01:49:16.549 --> 01:49:20.170]  I mean, they want it in some perverted way for themselves.
[01:49:21.135 --> 01:49:22.876]  But they hate it, everybody else.
[01:49:23.597 --> 01:49:33.265]  And they hate it when they see a healthy, pure, vigorous, outgoing, strong, determined, energetic freedom.
[01:49:34.286 --> 01:49:35.987]  They really hate that.
[01:49:36.047 --> 01:49:37.408]  And why do they hate that?
[01:49:37.529 --> 01:49:43.433]  Because they know that it's so deeply, deeply, deeply buried in themselves.
[01:49:45.335 --> 01:49:46.676]  They think it's out of reach.
[01:49:47.257 --> 01:49:47.777]  It's gone.
[01:49:47.817 --> 01:49:49.979]  They'll never find it in themselves.
[01:49:50.666 --> 01:49:56.371]  So when they see it reflected in other people, they hate it and they have to destroy it.
[01:49:57.412 --> 01:50:07.880]  As if they could wipe out the memory, the knowledge, the understanding that freedom exists if they wipe it out in enough free-loving people.
[01:50:11.163 --> 01:50:12.424]  That's what's going on.
[01:50:13.625 --> 01:50:14.666]  That's what's happening.
[01:50:16.047 --> 01:50:16.968]  That's the story.
[01:50:18.484 --> 01:50:31.816]  And sure, at different levels of the repression, you get these robot bureaucrats and puppets and front men and paid off people and bribed, blackmailed people.
[01:50:32.377 --> 01:50:36.360]  You get puppets like Joe Biden is a puppet.
[01:50:37.161 --> 01:50:39.383]  Kamala Harris is a willing puppet.
[01:50:41.005 --> 01:50:44.448]  As long as she can fret and strut her hour on the stage.
[01:50:47.523 --> 01:50:49.204]  Yeah, you get people like that.
[01:50:50.425 --> 01:51:01.713]  But the impulse and the top, top level people behind are the people that really feel this deep need to destroy freedom.
[01:51:01.853 --> 01:51:04.035]  They have to destroy it wherever they can find it.
[01:51:04.055 --> 01:51:04.915]  And that means you.
[01:51:05.456 --> 01:51:06.176]  It means me.
[01:51:06.196 --> 01:51:09.959]  It means wherever they can locate it, they want to destroy it.
[01:51:10.479 --> 01:51:13.341]  So they're not just looking for one person or two people.
[01:51:13.381 --> 01:51:14.262]  They figure the best
[01:51:15.222 --> 01:51:17.703]  The best strategy is to destroy it everywhere.
[01:51:19.224 --> 01:51:20.205]  Destroy it everywhere.
[01:51:20.245 --> 01:51:21.526]  Destroy the free market.
[01:51:21.566 --> 01:51:23.627]  Destroy the ability to work.
[01:51:24.067 --> 01:51:28.650]  Destroy the ability to make human connection with all these distancing regulations.
[01:51:29.150 --> 01:51:31.852]  Make people submit and hide behind the mask.
[01:51:32.252 --> 01:51:33.053]  Lock them down.
[01:51:33.113 --> 01:51:34.113]  Throw them out of work.
[01:51:34.593 --> 01:51:36.374]  In-house arrest in their homes.
[01:51:37.095 --> 01:51:38.836]  Which is what the lockdowns are.
[01:51:39.596 --> 01:51:40.557]  One after another.
[01:51:42.130 --> 01:51:49.472]  Destroy that impulse for freedom until people just surrender and give up and say, whatever you want, I go along.
[01:51:53.152 --> 01:51:57.453]  That's why that Buffalo video that I showed is so important.
[01:51:57.633 --> 01:52:03.214]  Because for 10 minutes, people woke up and said, no, this is not going to happen.
[01:52:03.854 --> 01:52:06.155]  Cops, public health, we don't care.
[01:52:07.415 --> 01:52:08.195]  You're out of here.
[01:52:08.295 --> 01:52:08.915]  You're gone.
[01:52:08.955 --> 01:52:09.496]  You're done.
[01:52:09.656 --> 01:52:10.176]  Get out.
[01:52:10.276 --> 01:52:11.576]  This is private property.
[01:52:12.608 --> 01:52:16.310]  And of course, that's the other key element of this.
[01:52:17.991 --> 01:52:31.878]  The people who were struggling for freedom for centuries in many countries, but mainly in Europe, were completely aware that private property was a major component of that.
[01:52:31.938 --> 01:52:32.658]  Because why?
[01:52:33.158 --> 01:52:40.102]  Because vassals and kings and emperors and all kinds of people owned everything, right?
[01:52:40.768 --> 01:52:45.791]  And if they didn't own it, they would take it over or give it to their friends.
[01:52:47.111 --> 01:52:58.237]  So the idea of being free and strong was intimately tied to the idea of owning property, to say, this is mine.
[01:52:58.997 --> 01:53:04.300]  And of course, you can see the incredible attacks that have been waged against that.
[01:53:05.712 --> 01:53:08.034]  Socialism, communism, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:53:08.054 --> 01:53:09.615]  And they all amount to the same thing.
[01:53:09.675 --> 01:53:10.675]  We want to abolish.
[01:53:10.735 --> 01:53:17.600]  We have to abolish private property because that designates that some people are better off than others.
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:18.841]  And we can't have that.
[01:53:19.221 --> 01:53:21.202]  So we have to eliminate it altogether.
[01:53:21.262 --> 01:53:22.823]  So the state owns everything.
[01:53:22.903 --> 01:53:29.928]  It's all in perpetuity taken out of the hands of people because you don't deserve to have property.
[01:53:30.368 --> 01:53:32.569]  You don't deserve to protect property.
[01:53:32.990 --> 01:53:34.791]  You don't deserve to have a gun.
[01:53:35.424 --> 01:53:37.265]  That allows you to protect property.
[01:53:37.605 --> 01:53:41.667]  You don't have the freedom to own property or to protect it.
[01:53:42.127 --> 01:53:50.290]  That's all an illusion that's going away because we, the insane ones, are going to destroy all of that.
[01:53:51.991 --> 01:54:03.236]  So you have all these front people, paid thugs, loonies, et cetera, et cetera, true believers in the cult of COVID.
[01:54:05.503 --> 01:54:09.265]  That are doing all of this destruction and threats and intimidation.
[01:54:10.726 --> 01:54:12.566]  It's all aimed at the same direction.
[01:54:13.167 --> 01:54:13.527]  Freedom.
[01:54:13.967 --> 01:54:15.828]  The impulse for freedom.
[01:54:17.189 --> 01:54:18.549]  The principle, yes.
[01:54:18.969 --> 01:54:21.391]  The constitutional embodiment, yes.
[01:54:22.531 --> 01:54:24.212]  The guarantee of, yes.
[01:54:24.912 --> 01:54:26.133]  But why?
[01:54:26.153 --> 01:54:30.455]  If that doesn't come from inside?
[01:54:31.107 --> 01:54:33.148]  From inside, where freedom begins.
[01:54:33.329 --> 01:54:33.889]  From you.
[01:54:34.449 --> 01:54:36.110]  From your impulse for freedom.
[01:54:36.591 --> 01:54:37.151]  To live.
[01:54:37.391 --> 01:54:38.332]  To be alive.
[01:54:39.213 --> 01:54:42.835]  To make decisions and choices on your own about what to do.
[01:54:45.757 --> 01:54:49.800]  That's what the American Republic was set up for.
[01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:55.063]  That's why government was so severely hamstrung in the Constitution.
[01:54:55.784 --> 01:55:00.027]  That's what the states were all about because
[01:55:00.922 --> 01:55:09.527]  Face it, it was the states who gave up powers in order to accept, ratify, and sign the Constitution.
[01:55:09.968 --> 01:55:11.328]  That was the process.
[01:55:14.971 --> 01:55:21.935]  It all goes back, though, to this fire inside of a human, living human being.
[01:55:22.255 --> 01:55:22.615]  Freedom.
[01:55:23.356 --> 01:55:30.440]  That desire, that power for freedom that has to spread like wildfire across the world now
[01:55:31.485 --> 01:55:33.466]  In any way possible.
[01:55:35.527 --> 01:56:01.040]  That's why I wanted to bring this clip back around in a circle to InfoWars viewers and show it to as many people as possible at Buffalo, but Jim, so that you would take it, send it out, you would share it, you would make sure that it gets out to millions and millions of people as just one way to wake up that impulse that's inside people that says to them,
[01:56:01.900 --> 01:56:02.580]  I'm alive.
[01:56:03.381 --> 01:56:05.642]  This is me talking to me.
[01:56:06.783 --> 01:56:23.933]  This is not epidemic, virus, germ, be afraid, mask, ooh, Fauci, oh, we think we know, PCR test, number of cases, infections are rising, we have to shut you down again, ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba.
[01:56:24.293 --> 01:56:25.234]  This is none of that.
[01:56:25.254 --> 01:56:27.135]  This has nothing to do with that.
[01:56:27.595 --> 01:56:30.577]  That's all the front job, the front end.
[01:56:31.420 --> 01:56:32.300]  Of the repression.
[01:56:33.041 --> 01:56:38.683]  That's all the brain clicking and clacking.
[01:56:38.964 --> 01:56:48.888]  It's going, oh, yeah, we have to look at it because the scientific journals said that they isolate the virus and the genetic engineer and the genome and the sequencing and yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:56:49.629 --> 01:56:49.869]  Yeah.
[01:56:50.609 --> 01:56:56.732]  I've spent nine months refuting every scientific premise of this friggin' pretended pandemic.
[01:56:57.774 --> 01:57:01.540]  And it all eventually comes around in a circle to where it began.
[01:57:01.560 --> 01:57:05.746]  They moved in and they suppressed freedom.
[01:57:06.948 --> 01:57:08.490]  And they want to keep on doing it.
[01:57:08.991 --> 01:57:10.093]  That impulse in you
[01:57:11.042 --> 01:57:28.466]  is their target and they intend to destroy it completely, leaving you and all those whom you love to be a shell of what they once were that is just anything they can do with as they wish to insert whatever they want or exterminate, wipe out, rub out.
[01:57:28.906 --> 01:57:29.907]  That's where they're going.
[01:57:29.967 --> 01:57:30.967]  That's what they're doing.
[01:57:31.467 --> 01:57:39.089]  And the remedy from the beginning and always is the freedom, fire inside every human
[01:57:39.830 --> 01:57:44.877]  That is going to say no, absolutely not, in many ways.
[01:57:45.899 --> 01:57:46.740]  See you next time.
[01:57:55.796 --> 01:58:01.538]  They don't just work for the communist Chinese, and the globalists, and the EU, and the whole Hollywood, America-hating, God-hating crew.
[01:58:02.038 --> 01:58:10.701]  They literally say that they are in control of our minds, and believe that they do own us, and tell us who the president is, even though that's not in law.
[01:58:11.461 --> 01:58:15.583]  And they're just gaslighting the whole public over and over again, saying, Joe Biden is president-elect.
[01:58:16.505 --> 01:58:19.288]  Repeating it over and over, you know, like a brainwashing mantra.
[01:58:19.748 --> 01:58:25.093]  When it's up, again, to the state government to certify those votes, and those votes are being challenged, there's massive evidence of fraud.
[01:58:25.574 --> 01:58:28.056]  Again, this is so incredibly clear.
[01:58:28.517 --> 01:58:34.883]  Biden said, because he thought he was going to lose up front, that, oh, we're going to challenge the vote no matter what, until every vote's counted.
[01:58:35.443 --> 01:58:38.667]  Well, a lot of votes haven't been counted, and there's massive fraud being discovered, so...
[01:58:39.087 --> 01:58:42.292]  We're going to hold the course here because Joe Biden is a communist Chinese agent.
[01:58:42.593 --> 01:58:43.254]  He's a globalist.
[01:58:43.274 --> 01:58:44.295]  He wants carbon taxes.
[01:58:44.456 --> 01:58:48.522]  He will destroy this country by design to consolidate power and take control of us.
[01:58:48.722 --> 01:58:49.263]  This is war.
[01:59:01.345 --> 01:59:05.127]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[01:59:05.648 --> 01:59:08.889]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[01:59:09.130 --> 01:59:11.811]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[01:59:12.411 --> 01:59:15.273]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[01:59:15.954 --> 01:59:17.675]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[01:59:18.215 --> 01:59:19.616]  I suggest Band.Video.
[01:59:20.296 --> 01:59:25.379]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[01:59:25.760 --> 01:59:33.705]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[01:59:34.225 --> 01:59:40.609]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[01:59:40.929 --> 01:59:43.751]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[01:59:52.717 --> 01:59:56.818]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:59:57.338 --> 01:59:58.659]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:59:58.679 --> 02:00:15.563]  The left is pushing its idealistic utopian vision of free college tuition.
[02:00:15.743 --> 02:00:18.864]  The fantasy completely ignores the known pitfalls.
[02:00:19.044 --> 02:00:20.665]  In a rapidly changing world,
[02:00:21.721 --> 02:00:26.065]  We should have free tuition at public colleges and universities.
[02:00:26.305 --> 02:00:30.750]  That should be a right of all Americans, regardless of the income of their families.
[02:00:31.210 --> 02:00:38.397]  If the liberal Marxist state rules over our system of higher learning, conservatism won't just be non-existent.
[02:00:38.537 --> 02:00:40.639]  Conservatives will be hunted down.
[02:00:40.799 --> 02:00:44.841]  Here at Sproul Plaza has always been the heart of student activism at UC Berkeley.
[02:00:44.881 --> 02:00:47.703]  Just a few seconds ago, we heard some drumming stop here.
[02:00:48.003 --> 02:00:49.904]  Always a very active and lively place.
[02:00:50.325 --> 02:00:54.347]  Well, a few days ago, one activist found himself on the receiving end of some violence.
[02:00:55.648 --> 02:00:58.009]  This was the scene on Upper Sproul Plaza.
[02:00:58.129 --> 02:00:58.830]  A shoving match.
[02:01:02.296 --> 02:01:03.677]  And then a sucker punch.
[02:01:04.077 --> 02:01:08.360]  The man in black is the suspect UC Berkeley officers are looking for tonight.
[02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:16.045]  The man in the white cap on the receiving end of that punch is Hayden Williams, a volunteer from conservative group Turning Points USA.
[02:01:16.425 --> 02:01:24.571]  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez doesn't want people to forget the people who continue to enable you-know-who.
[02:01:25.411 --> 02:01:31.735]  But this is a bit about archiving or making a list kind of reminds you of the Red Scare and McCarthyism.
[02:01:55.391 --> 02:02:07.082]  And I think those people in his administration that not only drafted some of those policies, but were complicit in those policies, shouldn't be forgotten.
[02:02:07.642 --> 02:02:11.966]  And I do think that people need to be held accountable for their actions.
[02:02:12.346 --> 02:02:16.110]  And I don't think it is reminiscent of McCarthyism at all.
[02:02:16.914 --> 02:02:21.075]  I think you have to be specific about who you're going to target as collaborators.
[02:02:21.315 --> 02:02:29.758]  What is their next job going to be and what is it like going into the job market, not from a normal White House where typically you've got a lot of offers, but coming from the Trump White House?
[02:02:30.158 --> 02:02:36.260]  The historian David Blight from Yale recently spoke about Trump and the GOP as the new confederacy.
[02:02:36.360 --> 02:02:38.442]  Now this was a very poisonous accusation.
[02:02:38.482 --> 02:02:38.822]  Think of it.
[02:02:38.862 --> 02:02:44.286]  First of all, a member of the party of the Confederacy is accusing the leader of the party of Lincoln of being a Confederate.
[02:02:44.647 --> 02:02:50.431]  But I think that what he was trying to do is sow the kind of hatred that makes Trump supporters into enemies.
[02:02:50.571 --> 02:02:53.534]  Enemies of the country, and then this licenses
[02:02:53.954 --> 02:03:07.562]  In the name of tolerance, believe me, a kind of wave of anger and retribution against these people because they are seen not as critics, not as dissenters, not as people who are wrong, who need to be persuaded, but as enemies who have to be taken out.
[02:03:07.963 --> 02:03:22.912]  As the Epoch Times pointed out, Mitchell Langbert of the National Association of Scholars found that political registration by doctorate-holding professors in top-tier liberal arts colleges is overwhelmingly democratic, with
[02:03:24.393 --> 02:03:27.775]  39% of the colleges in his study being Republican-free.
[02:03:28.055 --> 02:03:40.264]  The study also found that political affiliation skewed heavily Democratic, with more than 78% of academic departments having no politically conservative representation.
[02:03:40.464 --> 02:03:54.511]  During the 1960s and 1970s in the United States, students were being educated within the framework of Fabian and Frankfurt School socialism and cultural Marxism, with the heady mix of open sexuality and anything-goes societal upheaval.
[02:03:54.951 --> 02:04:03.295]  They gravitated to Frankfurt School demagogues such as MACUSA, herald as the father of the New Left, and the leading academic in the sexual revolution.
[02:04:03.875 --> 02:04:14.859]  He encouraged not only revolutionary militancy of groups like the Black Panthers and the Weather Underground, but also inspired widespread agitation, student unrest and control of campuses.
[02:04:15.459 --> 02:04:23.422]  It's not surprising that these new ideas were eagerly internalized among the ranks of newly liberated young men and women at our colleges and universities.
[02:04:23.883 --> 02:04:32.586]  This was the precursor of the stifling political correctness that has set the tone for the cultural and political instability we have witnessed over the past decades.
[02:04:33.286 --> 02:04:48.456]  The irony is the left's naive vision of a permanent brown shirt anarchist class graduating from the halls of state indoctrination will perpetually attack the very capitalist taxpayers that supported them.
[02:04:52.478 --> 02:04:59.823]  The colleges will morph from Marxist hellholes where the only inevitable outcome is the toppling of the left.
[02:05:01.670 --> 02:05:03.092]  Hello, useless eaters.
[02:05:03.613 --> 02:05:15.047]  As your unqualified, non-elected global human health overlord, I'd like to take this opportunity to flaunt my position of power and influence over society and share some of my plans for you and your future.
[02:05:15.628 --> 02:05:18.171]  When I amassed my fortune in computer software,
[02:05:18.291 --> 02:05:25.896]  I demonstrated that I was willing to lie, steal code, cheat my partners, and exercise monopolistic control to destroy my competitors.
[02:05:26.537 --> 02:05:30.119]  Now that I've retired, I can rebrand myself as a humanitarian.
[02:05:30.500 --> 02:05:41.668]  With my for-profit foundation MassGrading as a charity, I can advocate for population reduction and sponsor mass human experiments with unproven vaccines in vulnerable populations.
[02:05:42.208 --> 02:05:52.272]  Like my father, a powerful banker, eugenicist, and Rockefeller crony himself, it's always been my ambition to decide who lives and, more importantly, how many have to die.
[02:05:52.572 --> 02:06:00.834]  Whether it's under the guise of climate change or world health, it's really all about controlling and culling the human herd for fun and profit.
[02:06:16.226 --> 02:06:22.131]  We are live broadcasting worldwide on this Monday, November 23rd, worldwide transmission.
[02:06:23.011 --> 02:06:32.219]  We are 58 days out from the overthrow of our republic and the installation of a foreign Chinese-backed communist agent known as Joe Biden.
[02:06:34.051 --> 02:06:41.118]  Once they get him in, they're going to trigger giant false flag bombings, mass shootings, and then they're going to come with mass arrest.
[02:06:41.519 --> 02:06:49.707]  They're going to plunge the stock market by 80%, and then have the general public beg for martial law to stop it, and they are never going to stop.
[02:06:49.807 --> 02:06:52.130]  Persecutions, roundups, camps.
[02:06:53.111 --> 02:06:56.895]  If you think the Republicans led by McCarthy in the House
[02:06:58.601 --> 02:07:03.283]  And if you think that not-needs-senate up there isn't going to roll over to this, you're gravely mistaken.
[02:07:03.623 --> 02:07:04.483]  The gloves are off.
[02:07:05.544 --> 02:07:06.784]  Apple runs death camps.
[02:07:06.804 --> 02:07:07.645]  That's all you gotta know.
[02:07:08.805 --> 02:07:12.207]  The liberals that run things own death camps.
[02:07:12.907 --> 02:07:14.728]  They run death camps.
[02:07:17.029 --> 02:07:20.610]  Everything you've seen in China is now coming for you and your family.
[02:07:23.351 --> 02:07:24.532]  And we'll see what you're made of now.
[02:07:26.084 --> 02:07:29.909]  Because folks have finally figured out we're not playing games, this isn't a joke.
[02:07:30.449 --> 02:07:34.174]  They put Joe Biden in, the Chi-Coms are going to drop the hammer.
[02:07:34.834 --> 02:07:37.157]  Because they think you're soft, and they think you're weak.
[02:07:39.099 --> 02:07:40.561]  Big article from National File.
[02:07:41.322 --> 02:07:42.363]  It's an article on Infowars.
[02:07:43.370 --> 02:07:46.111]  There's a bunch of news articles about it in the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times.
[02:07:46.251 --> 02:07:52.794]  Well, you know, Apple is lobbying against a law that doesn't let companies use slave labor.
[02:07:53.715 --> 02:07:59.778]  And, you know, Trump signed an executive order six months ago about human trafficking and also slave labor.
[02:08:00.598 --> 02:08:06.261]  And, you know, we want that repealed, and Joe Biden's going to repeal it so Apple can run slave camps.
[02:08:07.739 --> 02:08:18.429]  Three million Muslims, a million Buddhists and Christians combined in camps all over China for simply being religious and not worshipping the Communist Party.
[02:08:20.070 --> 02:08:23.794]  So remember that when you see snot-nosed Antifa with their Mao Zedong patches.
[02:08:23.834 --> 02:08:28.038]  Remember that when you hear about how we're fascist and Trump's bad and all this.
[02:08:28.278 --> 02:08:33.503]  No, the people that run Biden are the ones that have the death camps.
[02:08:35.387 --> 02:08:36.407]  And that's the number one issue.
[02:08:36.467 --> 02:08:37.928]  They back authoritarian regimes.
[02:08:37.968 --> 02:08:46.612]  The United Nations Human Rights Panel has got countries like Saudi Arabia and Communist China on it.
[02:08:46.772 --> 02:08:47.512]  It's a joke.
[02:08:48.413 --> 02:08:51.454]  They'd be like making Hitler the head of the New York Holocaust Museum.
[02:08:53.395 --> 02:08:54.555]  So that's how this works.
[02:08:54.615 --> 02:09:01.699]  And they build the Apple component factories through their contractors directly on to these facilities.
[02:09:03.339 --> 02:09:04.780]  And everyone is quite proud of it.
[02:09:06.155 --> 02:09:08.036]  And that's who your liberal academics are.
[02:09:08.636 --> 02:09:09.737]  That's who your leftists are.
[02:09:09.757 --> 02:09:11.038]  That's who your trendies are.
[02:09:11.438 --> 02:09:12.819]  That's who they are.
[02:09:12.839 --> 02:09:18.062]  They're soulless monsters who are useful idiots.
[02:09:18.262 --> 02:09:26.166]  The average trendy, 99.99% of your trendies, are just the underminers who bring the country down.
[02:09:26.387 --> 02:09:29.368]  They're going to get nothing once things collapse.
[02:09:29.428 --> 02:09:33.631]  In fact, they're the type of people the globalists disdain the most.
[02:09:34.011 --> 02:09:35.672]  They'll be the first ones.
[02:09:37.295 --> 02:09:40.757]  They get put in a forced labor camp, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:09:42.958 --> 02:09:51.282]  You see, we're a 246-year-old country, and folks tend to think they're invincible, and they tend to think bad things can't happen to them.
[02:09:53.003 --> 02:09:54.344]  You know, you see that in a lot of young people.
[02:09:54.364 --> 02:09:56.265]  They've never been in a big car wreck.
[02:09:57.285 --> 02:09:58.786]  They've never been mugged.
[02:09:59.106 --> 02:10:00.047]  They've never been raped.
[02:10:02.015 --> 02:10:07.496]  They've never had something bad happen to them, but boy, when it finally does, they just can't believe it.
[02:10:07.916 --> 02:10:09.697]  That reality hit them between the eyes.
[02:10:10.477 --> 02:10:13.818]  And America is fat, dumb, and stupid.
[02:10:14.478 --> 02:10:17.719]  And is getting walked to the guillotine right now.
[02:10:18.519 --> 02:10:20.939]  We are already putting our feet on the first steps.
[02:10:21.740 --> 02:10:27.061]  And we're marching up to that Bill Gates executioner, and he's smiling and licking his dirty lips.
[02:10:29.574 --> 02:10:39.502]  So all of you, and the FBI, and the ATF, and the local police, and the bureaucrats, you have let the defense shields of the Republic lower.
[02:10:39.983 --> 02:10:40.763]  You're cowardice.
[02:10:41.404 --> 02:10:42.845]  You're going along with the system.
[02:10:42.885 --> 02:10:43.726]  You're being bought out.
[02:10:45.287 --> 02:10:49.691]  Has lowered our shields, and we are now flooding like a sinking ship.
[02:10:51.055 --> 02:11:10.625]  And so just remember when you're homeless, just remember when you have nothing, just remember when there's no running water, and there's no electricity for almost everybody, just remember, remember that you betrayed God, and you betrayed the children, and you betrayed the truth, and you didn't stand up, and you let this happen.
[02:11:11.985 --> 02:11:16.848]  We're under martial law, and now they're ratcheting the martial law back up.
[02:11:18.516 --> 02:11:45.868]  And in 58 days, if they have their way and the neocons and rhinos are able to make sure that Trump doesn't get his proper Supreme Court hearing with the absolute total fraud manifest, you need to understand that they know you've woken up a lot of people, they know they're in trouble, they know globalism's on its heels, and so they're counter-striking, and now that they've got their foot on our neck using the virus, using the fear,
[02:11:47.503 --> 02:11:52.726]  They are never going to let off of you again.
[02:11:52.746 --> 02:11:55.628]  That's how authoritarianism works.
[02:11:55.828 --> 02:11:57.649]  It's guaranteed.
[02:12:00.071 --> 02:12:05.354]  It's a guarantee that it's all over.
[02:12:05.754 --> 02:12:06.154]  All of it.
[02:12:06.835 --> 02:12:15.520]  So all the compliance with the system and all the going along with it is operant conditioning to prepare your mind.
[02:12:17.458 --> 02:12:26.608]  Eleven years ago, I put out a little documentary called Endgame 2.0.
[02:12:26.908 --> 02:12:29.951]  It's since been taken off the internet.
[02:12:30.071 --> 02:12:30.872]  It was internet only.
[02:12:31.433 --> 02:12:32.434]  Didn't put a DVD out.
[02:12:33.575 --> 02:12:36.538]  And in that film, we laid out their plan to collapse society.
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:41.483]  And their plan to trigger an economic collapse using a virus.
[02:12:42.043 --> 02:12:47.407]  And the reason I knew that was it had just come out in the Operation Lockstep.
[02:12:48.467 --> 02:12:49.668]  It's now about 11 years ago.
[02:12:51.349 --> 02:13:05.559]  And then this morning I was watching the David Knight Show, about 8.30, and he aired his entry nine years ago to the Operation 1776 film festival we had online.
[02:13:06.874 --> 02:13:10.056]  And he got fourth place, memory serves, but the film was very important.
[02:13:10.437 --> 02:13:16.741]  And it shows the psychological ruling class, who the globalists are, what they have planned for you and your family.
[02:13:17.342 --> 02:13:18.142]  Really did a great job.
[02:13:18.183 --> 02:13:19.383]  It's a six minute video.
[02:13:20.684 --> 02:13:22.386]  And so I thought I would air the whole thing.
[02:13:22.406 --> 02:13:25.228]  You only heard about a minute of it today and reminded me of how good it is.
[02:13:25.688 --> 02:13:27.029]  And I also wanted to give you this quote.
[02:13:27.089 --> 02:13:28.050]  I'll talk about it when we come back.
[02:13:28.650 --> 02:13:31.913]  If the situation was hopeless, their propaganda would be unnecessary.
[02:13:33.146 --> 02:13:37.309]  It's because we were turning the tide that they've gone thermonuclear.
[02:13:39.330 --> 02:13:46.394]  And I can look into the future and the hell that's coming and know that we'll end up beating them, but you can't wait until you realize that I'm not exaggerating.
[02:13:46.414 --> 02:13:50.197]  You can't wait until you finally figure out that this isn't a game.
[02:13:50.657 --> 02:13:51.978]  I'm not trying to scare you folks.
[02:13:52.518 --> 02:13:55.020]  They're going to try to implement what I just said.
[02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:56.241]  Now, will they get it done?
[02:13:56.321 --> 02:13:56.741]  I don't know.
[02:14:00.443 --> 02:14:01.024]  We're gonna go to break.
[02:14:02.125 --> 02:14:02.725]  We're going to come back.
[02:14:02.765 --> 02:14:05.846]  We've got all this election fraud evidence, the biggest yet.
[02:14:05.886 --> 02:14:16.048]  We've got Trump's path to victory, but it's narrowing because of the neocons and others turning against him and people in his own administration that want a future job who are being threatened.
[02:14:16.548 --> 02:14:17.168]  It's all coming up.
[02:14:17.188 --> 02:14:17.888]  Then I'll say this.
[02:14:20.269 --> 02:14:22.949]  This special is over a week overdue.
[02:14:23.929 --> 02:14:26.690]  I met with the folks today in the warehouse.
[02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:27.330]  They said, listen,
[02:14:28.646 --> 02:14:34.329]  You got it in the sale because a bunch of the things are about to sell out and it'll be months till we get more of it in.
[02:14:34.349 --> 02:14:37.931]  So we want to go back to full price so that we actually can make some money and fund our operation.
[02:14:37.951 --> 02:14:38.711]  You got to stop the special.
[02:14:39.331 --> 02:14:39.912]  I haven't had time.
[02:14:39.932 --> 02:14:42.173]  I've been working so hard fighting the global travel around the country.
[02:14:42.733 --> 02:14:45.255]  So this is the final day of American crisis emergency.
[02:14:45.315 --> 02:14:47.276]  Lockdown 2 is here.
[02:14:47.896 --> 02:14:51.898]  Support Infowars in the fight against total economic collapse and Biden's martial law disguises lockdown 2.
[02:14:53.539 --> 02:14:54.139]  Free shipping.
[02:14:55.380 --> 02:14:56.700]  Triple Patriot points up to 60% off.
[02:14:58.718 --> 02:15:05.491]  On Turbo Force, on DNA Force, on Vitamineral Fusion, on Knockout, on Brain Force, on Supermetal Vitality.
[02:15:07.074 --> 02:15:09.619]  Now back in stock for being sold out for a year, Alpha Power.
[02:15:11.445 --> 02:15:15.889]  As it'll beats back in stock 50% off info or store.com.
[02:15:16.309 --> 02:15:18.792]  And all of these are really essential vitamins and minerals.
[02:15:19.232 --> 02:15:22.515]  Amazing top of the line supplements that are just unrivaled out there.
[02:15:22.715 --> 02:15:23.896]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:15:24.517 --> 02:15:29.121]  I gotta go over and have an hour long meeting today about what can still be on sale, what can't, but most of it's gotta go off sale.
[02:15:29.681 --> 02:15:31.343]  And this is the last day because
[02:15:32.163 --> 02:15:33.244]  I've waited way too long.
[02:15:33.264 --> 02:15:34.325]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:15:34.605 --> 02:15:35.546]  But we need funds.
[02:15:35.846 --> 02:15:36.627]  Get some t-shirts.
[02:15:36.647 --> 02:15:37.507]  Get some Troy radios.
[02:15:37.968 --> 02:15:38.808]  Get some adorable food.
[02:15:38.849 --> 02:15:39.649]  Get some air filtration.
[02:15:39.669 --> 02:15:40.490]  Get some water filtration.
[02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:41.951]  Get some books, some films.
[02:15:42.091 --> 02:15:43.913]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:15:44.173 --> 02:15:44.913]  This isn't a game.
[02:15:45.194 --> 02:15:46.715]  Get this material while you still can.
[02:15:47.095 --> 02:15:50.518]  Biden gets in, good chance they're going to throw a black bag over my head and I'm going to disappear.
[02:15:50.898 --> 02:15:54.101]  They already got feds and CIA following me everywhere I go.
[02:15:54.301 --> 02:15:55.562]  They sit down next to me in restaurants.
[02:15:55.582 --> 02:15:57.423]  When I get up in their face, they run out of the building.
[02:15:57.703 --> 02:15:58.184]  Be right back.
[02:16:00.418 --> 02:16:02.699]  The company is called Dominion Voting.
[02:16:02.759 --> 02:16:04.239]  It's used in 28 states.
[02:16:04.419 --> 02:16:09.020]  Well, I can hardly wait to put forth all the evidence we have collected on Dominion.
[02:16:09.040 --> 02:16:18.023]  Dominion came under heavy fire after allegations that their machines caused thousands of votes in one Michigan county to be switched from Donald Trump to Joe Biden.
[02:16:18.803 --> 02:16:21.866]  It was designed with a back door so that people could watch in real time
[02:16:42.706 --> 02:16:49.090]  And calculate with an algorithm how many votes they needed to change to make the result they wanted to create.
[02:16:49.170 --> 02:16:51.912]  Each voting machine is a computer running a computer program.
[02:16:52.752 --> 02:17:01.677]  Whether that computer counts the votes accurately, or makes mistakes, or cheats by shifting votes from one candidate to another, depends on what software is installed in the computer.
[02:17:01.877 --> 02:17:07.641]  President Trump won by not just hundreds of thousands of votes, but by millions of votes.
[02:17:08.081 --> 02:17:17.805]  In Antrim County, ballots were counted for Democrats that were meant for Republicans, causing a 6,000 vote swing against our candidate.
[02:17:17.965 --> 02:17:24.687]  The county clerk came forward and said tabulating software glitched and caused a miscalculation of the votes.
[02:17:24.867 --> 02:17:32.790]  Since then, we have now discovered that 47 counties use this same software in the same capacity.
[02:17:32.930 --> 02:17:38.394]  We have sworn witness testimony of why the software was designed.
[02:17:38.434 --> 02:17:40.315]  It was designed to rig elections.
[02:17:40.395 --> 02:17:46.099]  And the software development was funded by the Clinton Global Initiative.
[02:17:46.199 --> 02:17:47.319]  That's what the Democrats do.
[02:17:47.399 --> 02:17:49.641]  If they don't like the rules, they change them.
[02:17:50.081 --> 02:17:54.464]  And they change them at the last minute, they manipulate them, they want to tear down our American system.
[02:17:54.545 --> 02:17:56.486]  It is indeed a very foul mess.
[02:17:56.546 --> 02:17:59.748]  It is farther and wider and deeper than we ever thought.
[02:17:59.989 --> 02:18:04.312]  But we are going to go after it, and I am going to expose every one of them.
[02:18:04.892 --> 02:18:09.736]  Installing that vote-stealing program in a voting machine takes seven minutes per machine with a screwdriver.
[02:18:09.976 --> 02:18:12.158]  But really, the software I built was not rocket science.
[02:18:12.718 --> 02:18:14.720]  Any computer programmer could write the same code.
[02:18:15.480 --> 02:18:19.163]  Once it's installed, it could steal elections without detection for years to come.
[02:18:19.383 --> 02:18:25.126]  We've got statistical evidence that shows hundreds of thousands of votes being just put in and replicated.
[02:18:25.286 --> 02:18:29.789]  In total, about 500,000 votes were taken from Trump and switched to Biden.
[02:18:29.809 --> 02:18:30.049]  130,000 here, 27,000 there.
[02:18:30.069 --> 02:18:32.350]  You can see how there's 200,000 votes magically for Biden at 3 a.m.
[02:18:32.410 --> 02:18:33.351]  in Wisconsin and Michigan.
[02:18:38.854 --> 02:18:44.537]  It's like drag and drop Trump votes to a separate folder and then delete that folder.
[02:18:44.657 --> 02:18:59.947]  This is literally global government, the Communist Chinese and others want to take this country over and President Trump has been standing against that and he was winning all these battleground states by higher numbers on election night till they closed the polls and then secretly stuffed the ballot boxes.
[02:19:00.407 --> 02:19:05.590]  And so that's why they're scared of recounts, it's why they're scared of legislatures stepping in, that is their constitutional duty.
[02:19:05.930 --> 02:19:07.211]  This is stunning.
[02:19:09.241 --> 02:19:24.390]  Heartbreaking, infuriating, and the most unpatriotic acts I can even imagine for people in this country to have participated in in any way, shape, or form.
[02:19:25.091 --> 02:19:29.693]  And I want the American public to know right now that we will not be intimidated.
[02:19:30.254 --> 02:19:32.095]  American patriots are fed up
[02:19:32.335 --> 02:19:37.837]  With the corruption from the local level to the highest level of our government.
[02:19:37.957 --> 02:19:40.158]  And we are going to take this country back.
[02:19:40.619 --> 02:19:42.419]  We are not going to be intimidated.
[02:19:42.479 --> 02:19:44.100]  We are not going to back down.
[02:19:44.560 --> 02:19:47.462]  We are going to clean this mess up now.
[02:19:47.942 --> 02:19:50.263]  President Trump won by a landslide.
[02:19:50.303 --> 02:19:51.423]  We are going to prove it.
[02:19:52.064 --> 02:19:57.166]  And we are going to reclaim the United States of America for the people who vote for freedom.
[02:20:02.443 --> 02:20:06.527]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:07.067 --> 02:20:08.388]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:20:13.793 --> 02:20:23.382]  Hey guys, I don't mind this bumper music, but we're not talking about Big Mike right now, so let's kill it.
[02:20:24.591 --> 02:20:26.352]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:26.552 --> 02:20:28.134]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[02:20:28.394 --> 02:20:41.263]  And coming up next segment, I'm going to lay out the just devastating evidence of the permanent, total lockdown designed to totally bankrupt you and economically bring you to your knees for the social engineers and their horrible takeover.
[02:20:41.663 --> 02:20:43.124]  I mean, they're just making their move.
[02:20:43.224 --> 02:20:43.884]  They don't care.
[02:20:44.185 --> 02:20:45.205]  You can see it everywhere.
[02:20:45.225 --> 02:20:48.568]  You cannot estimate how evil it is.
[02:20:48.628 --> 02:20:50.469]  And by the way, submitting only makes it worse.
[02:20:50.769 --> 02:20:51.890]  You can try to join them.
[02:20:51.910 --> 02:20:52.971]  You'll be destroyed even faster.
[02:20:54.079 --> 02:20:54.819]  James Bond movie.
[02:20:55.840 --> 02:20:56.360]  Doctor, no.
[02:20:57.360 --> 02:20:58.361]  James Bond's been captured.
[02:20:58.381 --> 02:20:59.481]  He says, you expect me to talk?
[02:20:59.521 --> 02:21:00.622]  He goes, no, Mr. Bond.
[02:21:00.982 --> 02:21:01.983]  I expect you to die.
[02:21:02.703 --> 02:21:05.144]  Resistance is the only shot you've got.
[02:21:06.545 --> 02:21:06.985]  Period.
[02:21:08.405 --> 02:21:17.610]  And by the time it dawns on people, even inside government and corporate bureaucracies, they're going to be so scared they're going to keep going along with their own destruction.
[02:21:17.890 --> 02:21:22.672]  This is a scientific, satanic, mathematical algorithm of total destruction.
[02:21:24.104 --> 02:21:27.386]  Where you could have one globalist left on Earth, and then Satan would destroy them.
[02:21:28.547 --> 02:21:29.787]  The plan is total betrayal!
[02:21:30.588 --> 02:21:48.258]  Now, this video was put out by David Knight nine years ago, and it gets into the psychology of all of this, it gets into the mindset of it, it gets into how they use operant Pavlovian conditioning to make you love your servitude and the type of world they're wanting to build.
[02:21:50.179 --> 02:21:55.925]  And the Rockefeller Foundation said they'd use the fear of a virus to get this done.
[02:21:56.025 --> 02:21:58.467]  Strangely enough, we found a copy of this on YouTube.
[02:21:58.547 --> 02:22:01.690]  It's titled, GovSkull is 1984 on training wheels.
[02:22:01.770 --> 02:22:02.931]  Infowars.com.
[02:22:03.372 --> 02:22:04.152]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:22:04.433 --> 02:22:07.616]  I'm sure they'll ban it now that we've talked about it.
[02:22:07.696 --> 02:22:11.299]  It'll be living at ban.video.
[02:22:11.319 --> 02:22:14.743]  I'm gonna give a different title that basically, you know, filmmaker predicted lockdown.
[02:22:16.926 --> 02:22:17.646]  Nine years ago.
[02:22:17.726 --> 02:22:25.788]  But this is the psychological rulers who pretend they're God and then manipulate us psychologically even though they're the most insane, the most out of control.
[02:22:26.868 --> 02:22:40.090]  That's what's so crazy about this is, statistically, these globalists have the worst families, they're the most unhappy people, but they want to get us so confused and so out of our environment and so upside down that they can play God because they're vandals.
[02:22:40.110 --> 02:22:42.791]  They project their own hatred of themselves onto us.
[02:22:43.968 --> 02:22:53.539]  And then we've got huge election fraud compilations, gateway pundits knocked it out of the park, funding this big stop-the-steal Justice League of America vote fraud investigation.
[02:22:53.559 --> 02:22:54.259]  That's all coming up.
[02:22:54.520 --> 02:22:58.164]  But here is this powerful David Knight report from nine years ago.
[02:22:59.258 --> 02:23:04.482]  Do you remember watching old World War II movies where the Germans were manning... What have you done with your papers?
[02:23:05.222 --> 02:23:11.767]  How did we get to the point where you not only have to constantly provide your identity papers, but you have to be x-rayed and sexually molested to travel?
[02:23:11.968 --> 02:23:14.269]  Why are only a minority of us bothered by this?
[02:23:15.130 --> 02:23:16.951]  How did we lose our freedom and dignity?
[02:23:17.612 --> 02:23:18.552]  And how do we get them back?
[02:23:19.053 --> 02:23:19.653]  Well, the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:23:23.752 --> 02:23:30.298]  Colonial Americans would never have tolerated this from a government that, in their view, had been created to protect their God-given rights.
[02:23:30.979 --> 02:23:34.162]  But Americans today are very different from Americans in 1776.
[02:23:34.442 --> 02:23:39.768]  The difference is the education and conditioning we receive in government schools.
[02:23:40.568 --> 02:23:47.915]  In 1948, Orwell wrote 1984, which explores the horrors of an authoritarian government that has taken away freedom and dignity.
[02:23:48.496 --> 02:23:50.738]  But that same year, an American, B.F.
[02:23:50.798 --> 02:23:53.580]  Skinner, also wrote a novel about a totalitarian government.
[02:23:53.900 --> 02:23:58.804]  But Skinner viewed total government control not as a horror to be avoided, but as a goal.
[02:23:59.225 --> 02:24:07.552]  His later book on behavioral psychology, Beyond Freedom and Dignity, is required reading in many colleges of education in the area of behavioral psychology.
[02:24:07.692 --> 02:24:09.433]  Now we have to put the world in order.
[02:24:10.134 --> 02:24:16.099]  It will be a long and complicated struggle, but we have the unity of a common order and a common knowledge.
[02:24:16.732 --> 02:24:30.257]  There are many different theories about what a perfect society should look like, but all the social engineers agree that the key to accomplishing their vision of utopia is to get control of children at the youngest possible age, separating them from their parents and attaching them to the state.
[02:24:30.677 --> 02:24:39.381]  Skinner sought to abolish family, religion, democracy, capitalism, freedom, and dignity in his ideal society.
[02:24:40.458 --> 02:24:41.438]  The new world beginning.
[02:24:42.039 --> 02:24:43.379]  Just look at the results.
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:56.745]  In 1984, the Ministry of Truth was responsible for all education, fine arts, news, one source, one authority, for all information, which freed the Ministry of Truth from the concern of actually telling the truth.
[02:24:57.461 --> 02:25:05.972]  With a continuing centralization in education, our government is increasingly considered to be the authoritative final arbiter of what goes into textbooks and curriculum.
[02:25:06.192 --> 02:25:10.538]  It even influences the choice of textbooks for most private schools and some homeschoolers.
[02:25:10.858 --> 02:25:16.325]  At the same time, the schools have been at the forefront of adopting all aspects of the surveillance police state.
[02:25:16.565 --> 02:25:20.769]  No tactic is too severe for the Ministry of Love to use in protecting its students.
[02:25:21.149 --> 02:25:22.391]  Teddy bears with cameras.
[02:25:23.071 --> 02:25:24.593]  Pencil sharpeners with cameras.
[02:25:24.933 --> 02:25:26.254]  Ties with cameras.
[02:25:26.494 --> 02:25:27.335]  Cameras everywhere.
[02:25:27.736 --> 02:25:28.296]  Checkpoints.
[02:25:28.897 --> 02:25:29.757]  Locker inspections.
[02:25:30.258 --> 02:25:30.959]  Metal detectors.
[02:25:31.719 --> 02:25:33.121]  Police.
[02:25:33.642 --> 02:25:35.064]  5,000 in New York City schools alone.
[02:25:35.325 --> 02:25:36.346]  Constant surveillance.
[02:25:36.887 --> 02:25:38.369]  No freedom, no dignity.
[02:25:38.590 --> 02:25:43.197]  Our centralized government schools have become a combination of many love and many true.
[02:25:43.537 --> 02:25:45.079]  GovSchool is 1984 on training wheels.
[02:25:47.783 --> 02:25:52.724]  Textbooks today are constantly updating the past to reinforce the social engineering fad of the day.
[02:25:52.964 --> 02:26:01.526]  The founders who valued individual freedom have become unpersons, vanished, written out of the textbooks in favor of contemporary persons who embody political correctness.
[02:26:02.246 --> 02:26:05.027]  The students adored the party and everything associated with it.
[02:26:05.207 --> 02:26:09.228]  The songs, the banners, the drilling, the yelling of slogans, the worship of Big Brother.
[02:26:09.248 --> 02:26:14.729]  It was all sort of a glamorous game to them, systematically turning them into ungumorable little savages.
[02:26:15.009 --> 02:26:18.032]  Yet this produced no tendency to rebel against government goals.
[02:26:18.573 --> 02:26:21.997]  All their ferocity was turned outward against enemies of the state.
[02:26:23.598 --> 02:26:25.260]  How do we answer this Orwellian nightmare?
[02:26:27.624 --> 02:26:28.625]  The answer is 1776.
[02:26:29.146 --> 02:26:31.928]  There was no Federal Department of Education in 1776.
[02:26:32.249 --> 02:26:35.011]  There was no Department of Education even in 1976.
[02:26:36.473 --> 02:26:43.940]  America rose to greatness with a population that was educated at home or in small, locally controlled schools under close supervision of the parents.
[02:26:44.220 --> 02:26:47.944]  The literacy rate in Colonial America without Gov School was higher than today.
[02:26:48.604 --> 02:26:54.146]  20th century figures that were homeschooled included the Wright Brothers, Thomas Edison, Douglas MacArthur, and George Patton.
[02:26:54.386 --> 02:27:01.149]  The generation of Americans that defeated the institutionalized fascist followers of Hitler had, on average, eight years at school.
[02:27:01.449 --> 02:27:06.291]  A couple of generations later, and our institutionalized children are in school from age 3 to 22.
[02:27:07.411 --> 02:27:07.852]  19 years!
[02:27:08.192 --> 02:27:11.393]  And they're arguably more dependent and definitely more socialist.
[02:27:11.713 --> 02:27:14.014]  So how would 1776 look today?
[02:27:14.214 --> 02:27:18.855]  For starters, we take back our children from the socialist planners and the social science experimenters.
[02:27:19.415 --> 02:27:23.055]  Government control of education is government control of our children.
[02:27:23.515 --> 02:27:31.017]  We stop the government control of education by stopping the flow of our money for education going to the government and only a portion coming back to us.
[02:27:31.397 --> 02:27:35.058]  We stop the government from defining education by selecting curriculum and textbooks.
[02:27:35.899 --> 02:27:42.884]  Government control of education must be abolished for the same reasons we don't have a state church, and that we shouldn't have state-run media.
[02:27:43.445 --> 02:27:47.848]  You can't have freedom of religion or freedom of speech if you don't have freedom of education.
[02:27:48.188 --> 02:27:54.473]  I'm not arguing that we abandon education, but that we stop abandoning our children to government institutions to raise.
[02:27:55.234 --> 02:27:59.237]  Do you not agree that sending your child to a government school is abandoning them to the state?
[02:27:59.937 --> 02:28:01.198]  Well, that's what the government says.
[02:28:01.579 --> 02:28:04.381]  The Federal District Court in Massachusetts said in a finding,
[02:28:05.327 --> 02:28:08.422]  Parents do have a fundamental right to raise their children.
[02:28:09.150 --> 02:28:12.071]  They're not required to abandon that responsibility to the state.
[02:28:12.872 --> 02:28:14.793]  They may send their children to a private school.
[02:28:15.373 --> 02:28:17.274]  They may also educate their children at home.
[02:28:18.034 --> 02:28:21.556]  In other words, the court outlined three options for parents.
[02:28:22.477 --> 02:28:26.759]  Send your child to private school, teach them at home, or abandon them.
[02:28:27.159 --> 02:28:29.320]  That is your responsibility to the state.
[02:28:30.340 --> 02:28:35.163]  Parents, teachers, businesses, everyone in society values education.
[02:28:36.124 --> 02:28:44.426]  When it is privatized and funded by some mixture of parents, vouchers, and charities, it will be controlled by the people who know and love children the best.
[02:28:45.206 --> 02:28:45.686]  Their parents.
[02:28:49.327 --> 02:28:50.708]  Alright, great job, David Knight.
[02:28:50.748 --> 02:28:52.728]  We're gonna re-upload that to Band.Video.
[02:28:52.768 --> 02:28:54.009]  You have thousands of videos.
[02:28:54.049 --> 02:28:54.729]  Tens of thousands.
[02:28:55.309 --> 02:28:56.949]  Sixty, seventy plus thousand, I forget.
[02:28:57.149 --> 02:28:59.450]  That's like sixty-five thousand videos we need to re-upload.
[02:29:01.826 --> 02:29:06.528]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes of the two.
[02:29:07.008 --> 02:29:09.409]  One is born of renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[02:29:10.049 --> 02:29:18.412]  One bases its power on having a strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[02:29:19.112 --> 02:29:24.494]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it.
[02:29:25.474 --> 02:29:33.017]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[02:29:33.578 --> 02:29:36.759]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[02:29:37.179 --> 02:29:41.461]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[02:29:42.021 --> 02:29:43.742]  A global permanent lockdown is here.
[02:29:43.762 --> 02:29:46.643]  It is already causing millions and millions to starve to death.
[02:29:47.163 --> 02:29:48.724]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[02:29:49.324 --> 02:29:56.940]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[02:29:57.181 --> 02:29:57.862]  That's the facts.
[02:29:57.982 --> 02:29:59.946]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.
[02:30:00.779 --> 02:30:08.985]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Root Supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:30:09.265 --> 02:30:19.473]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[02:30:19.793 --> 02:30:29.441]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[02:30:29.781 --> 02:30:35.524]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[02:30:35.764 --> 02:30:40.326]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[02:30:40.606 --> 02:30:48.790]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to,
[02:30:49.650 --> 02:31:04.216]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[02:31:04.516 --> 02:31:08.498]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[02:31:08.838 --> 02:31:17.362]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:17.702 --> 02:31:33.987]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[02:31:34.307 --> 02:31:45.351]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[02:31:45.831 --> 02:31:54.038]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[02:31:54.318 --> 02:32:00.144]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:32:02.205 --> 02:32:09.432]  Taking advantage of what nature's most nutrient-dense ingredients, VasoBeats will be your new favorite InfoWars life formula.
[02:32:11.954 --> 02:32:18.017]  Using only water and beetroot, VasoBeet is the most concentrated liquid extract of beet on the market.
[02:32:20.759 --> 02:32:31.605]  With concentrated beet extract, you can get the high levels of betaine, nitrates, and antioxidants you want to help support a healthy liver, athletic performance, blood vessels, and more.
[02:32:35.825 --> 02:32:37.486]  Don't overlook the power of beetroots.
[02:32:37.806 --> 02:32:45.531]  Get your naturally occurring potassium, folate, vitamin C, iron, selenium, zinc, vitamin K, and more.
[02:32:49.253 --> 02:32:53.656]  With one of nature's greatest treasures in Vaso Beach from InfoWars Life today.
[02:33:02.768 --> 02:33:06.850]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:07.390 --> 02:33:08.710]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:18.254 --> 02:33:24.277]  Well, you live to see it.
[02:33:24.317 --> 02:33:28.478]  You might be 90 years old, you might be 10 years old, you might have just been born.
[02:33:29.379 --> 02:33:30.039]  But you're living.
[02:33:31.425 --> 02:33:45.728]  In the year 2020, when the New World Order made its move, and the United Nations, Bill Gates, Ted Turner, David Rockefeller, Prince Philip, all of them always said, we will have our New World Order by 2020.
[02:33:48.128 --> 02:33:51.849]  And by 2030, we would have started massive force depopulation.
[02:33:53.470 --> 02:33:54.990]  And boy, are they not doing it.
[02:33:55.956 --> 02:34:05.984]  I've got stacks of articles here of 59 flu shot deaths in South Korea, and they say, we don't care, we're going to force it on everybody.
[02:34:07.225 --> 02:34:14.011]  I've got articles about people dying all over in the trials of the COVID-supposed vaccines.
[02:34:14.051 --> 02:34:16.373]  They're not even vaccines, they reprogram your cells like cancer.
[02:34:17.634 --> 02:34:18.835]  They are cancer viruses, actually.
[02:34:19.396 --> 02:34:20.477]  Weaponized cancer viruses.
[02:34:20.497 --> 02:34:23.159]  But they just put it out there and go, yeah, some of you are going to die.
[02:34:26.645 --> 02:34:30.629]  700,000 people are going to get sick.
[02:34:32.410 --> 02:34:34.092]  It's going to be way more than that, but it's just okay.
[02:34:34.112 --> 02:34:35.133]  You just get used to it.
[02:34:35.714 --> 02:34:36.995]  Oh, you had a seizure.
[02:34:37.015 --> 02:34:38.476]  Oh, you got cancer.
[02:34:38.836 --> 02:34:40.018]  Oh, you're paralyzed.
[02:34:40.538 --> 02:34:41.579]  Well, we're not going to cover it.
[02:34:41.619 --> 02:34:42.620]  You'll just be a number.
[02:34:48.305 --> 02:34:50.147]  Because we're getting rid of your dignity.
[02:34:53.695 --> 02:34:55.717]  And we played that earlier report about B.F.
[02:34:55.737 --> 02:34:59.299]  Skinner and Pavlov and, you know, hell, Kinsey.
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:08.006]  I mean, we're talking about people that, in the case of Kinsey and Skinner, believed in pedophilia.
[02:35:08.546 --> 02:35:09.407]  They were pedophiles.
[02:35:09.467 --> 02:35:09.807]  Look it up.
[02:35:10.368 --> 02:35:11.789]  They believed in torture.
[02:35:11.829 --> 02:35:14.891]  They believed... One of them wrote a book titled Beyond Evil.
[02:35:18.574 --> 02:35:19.635]  Oh, we're beyond evil.
[02:35:21.772 --> 02:35:24.274]  And they are worshipped by the left.
[02:35:24.294 --> 02:35:27.816]  I remember one time I was hanging out with a famous movie director who wanted to meet with me.
[02:35:29.717 --> 02:35:33.740]  And he said, I notice you talk about Bertrand Russell on your show.
[02:35:33.780 --> 02:35:35.901]  He's one of the greatest humans to ever live.
[02:35:35.921 --> 02:35:50.711]  And I looked at him and I said, Bertrand Russell wanted to have a world government in the 30s, he wrote about it, and envision bat-winged stealth bombers that would fly around dropping atomic bombs on people before they even invented them.
[02:35:50.731 --> 02:35:51.512]  They had the equations.
[02:35:52.995 --> 02:35:55.416]  To depopulate the earth and end war.
[02:35:56.136 --> 02:36:02.418]  And the director said, well, wouldn't it be better to do that and not let it have an uncontrolled war, then we all die?
[02:36:02.898 --> 02:36:04.618]  And I'm just looking at a psychotic.
[02:36:04.638 --> 02:36:08.059]  I'm not gonna say the name of the director.
[02:36:12.400 --> 02:36:13.661]  And these people are in a cult, folks.
[02:36:13.701 --> 02:36:18.362]  They'll look at you just like Russell looks in that photo of your TV viewer.
[02:36:18.402 --> 02:36:21.063]  They all act just like, it's the spirit.
[02:36:22.717 --> 02:36:29.703]  It's this power trip that they're in charge and they're the masters of the universe.
[02:36:30.504 --> 02:36:32.245]  And I guess we put up with it, so they are.
[02:36:36.168 --> 02:36:38.230]  But most of them end up in lunatic asylums.
[02:36:41.633 --> 02:36:43.294]  Riding on the walls of their own feces.
[02:36:43.715 --> 02:36:44.235]  Look into it.
[02:36:46.837 --> 02:36:48.139]  Their families don't care about them.
[02:36:48.279 --> 02:36:49.660]  None of their friends are really their friends.
[02:36:49.720 --> 02:36:50.661]  They die alone.
[02:36:53.479 --> 02:36:54.141]  Horrible people.
[02:36:54.522 --> 02:36:55.484]  Klaus Schwab.
[02:36:55.504 --> 02:36:58.893]  Boris Johnson.
[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:06.921]  By the way, sometimes I'm on air and I just say things that are wrong, and later I hear it and I'm like, how the hell did no one correct me?
[02:37:07.282 --> 02:37:15.364]  I was saying the Georgia Guidestones were built 30 years ago by Ted Turner calling for world government and depopulation of the planet by 80 plus percent.
[02:37:15.864 --> 02:37:17.105]  It's 40 years ago!
[02:37:17.805 --> 02:37:26.847]  It's like, I will get like the most complex stuff right for some obscure bill number, but if it's like the year 2020, that's 40 years.
[02:37:27.268 --> 02:37:28.528]  But my mind just can't believe
[02:37:30.690 --> 02:37:31.791]  Years have gone by like that.
[02:37:34.293 --> 02:37:36.514]  The Georgia Guidestones were only 13 years old.
[02:37:38.396 --> 02:37:38.876]  14 years old.
[02:37:40.517 --> 02:37:41.718]  When I first started getting on air.
[02:37:46.041 --> 02:37:47.041]  Absolutely insane.
[02:37:50.264 --> 02:37:52.225]  But see, I didn't consciously lie to you like that.
[02:37:52.525 --> 02:37:53.206]  I just got it wrong.
[02:37:53.686 --> 02:37:57.809]  But let me just tell you what's coming up, then we'll open the phones up.
[02:37:58.189 --> 02:37:59.450]  You need to be heard from.
[02:38:00.987 --> 02:38:09.453]  I also want to invite and also welcome the massive viewership we're getting from those leaving Fox News.
[02:38:10.534 --> 02:38:15.457]  Our overall personal audio streams and video streams are five times what they were a year ago.
[02:38:16.778 --> 02:38:20.000]  And the show has completely gone stratospheric, which the enemy knows.
[02:38:21.221 --> 02:38:22.302]  And so is Newsmax.
[02:38:22.322 --> 02:38:22.942]  They're exploding.
[02:38:23.002 --> 02:38:24.083]  So is OAN.
[02:38:24.423 --> 02:38:24.984]  I love that.
[02:38:25.484 --> 02:38:26.665]  I wish there were a hundred other channels.
[02:38:26.685 --> 02:38:27.886]  I just want to save this country.
[02:38:29.514 --> 02:38:32.857]  That's why CNN is calling for OAN and Newsmax to be shut down.
[02:38:33.918 --> 02:38:36.940]  And yeah, we're more hardcore than Newsmax, and OAN's pretty hardcore.
[02:38:37.421 --> 02:38:38.161]  They do a great job.
[02:38:38.722 --> 02:38:39.743]  Their owner's a great person.
[02:38:39.763 --> 02:38:42.645]  And of course, we're number one on cloud TV.
[02:38:43.486 --> 02:38:45.448]  It also carries OAN and Newsmax.
[02:38:47.179 --> 02:38:49.319]  But on a level playing field, we dwarf their audience.
[02:38:49.399 --> 02:38:52.440]  All their audiences combined are not as big as ours, just on that one platform.
[02:38:52.980 --> 02:38:57.881]  And I tell you that because that's what I said earlier, is the unknown quote.
[02:38:58.041 --> 02:39:00.061]  You can't find who ever said it, but it's totally true.
[02:39:01.442 --> 02:39:05.482]  If the situation was hopeless, their propaganda would be unnecessary.
[02:39:07.583 --> 02:39:09.183]  They're the hopeless ones that serve Satan.
[02:39:09.323 --> 02:39:15.124]  So as negative as I am, and as bad as the stuff is, I tell you, it's like the doctor telling you,
[02:39:16.892 --> 02:39:22.415]  You've got emphysema, and if you keep smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, you'll be dead in five years.
[02:39:22.475 --> 02:39:23.896]  If you stop, you might live 20 years.
[02:39:24.336 --> 02:39:25.917]  If you don't listen, you're probably dead in five years.
[02:39:26.677 --> 02:39:31.220]  Or if you're drinking two bottles of vodka a day, and the doctor says your liver's starting to go out, you could have liver failure.
[02:39:31.240 --> 02:39:32.881]  I mean, it's a fact.
[02:39:33.481 --> 02:39:35.262]  And I'm not here telling you all this to scare you.
[02:39:35.702 --> 02:39:36.402]  I believe in you.
[02:39:37.103 --> 02:39:42.446]  And I believe you're going to take action, and peacefully, and ideologically and spiritually.
[02:39:43.424 --> 02:39:47.267]  That we're going to overturn this corrupt takeover, but you've got to recognize you're under assault.
[02:39:49.668 --> 02:39:53.170]  So let me tell you what we've got here to deal with.
[02:39:56.232 --> 02:40:04.698]  I want to invite all the new viewers that tuned in, who got past the Jedi mind trick of, Alex Jones is off the air.
[02:40:05.118 --> 02:40:06.079]  He's nowhere to be found.
[02:40:06.099 --> 02:40:07.540]  Infowars.com.
[02:40:07.580 --> 02:40:08.240]  Band.video.
[02:40:09.121 --> 02:40:11.923]  I want to invite all of you to take the next step.
[02:40:12.961 --> 02:40:19.383]  And that is tell everyone you know about Bandot Video and about Infowars.com.
[02:40:20.684 --> 02:40:22.624]  And to encourage them to then tell others.
[02:40:23.405 --> 02:40:26.466]  And it's that chain reaction that's going to bring the globalists down.
[02:40:26.506 --> 02:40:27.586]  We're very, very close to it.
[02:40:27.606 --> 02:40:28.606]  They're very, very desperate.
[02:40:30.007 --> 02:40:33.568]  These attacks they've launched are not going well, trying to steal it.
[02:40:33.608 --> 02:40:34.628]  They had a national poll out.
[02:40:35.008 --> 02:40:39.410]  87% of Republicans don't believe that Joe Biden won the election.
[02:40:42.657 --> 02:40:48.239]  That's why Brian Stelter got up last week and said, there's really no Republicans that believe Trump really won.
[02:40:48.679 --> 02:40:49.860]  Only a few crazy people.
[02:40:50.040 --> 02:40:51.340]  Everything he says is a lie.
[02:40:52.981 --> 02:40:55.582]  So the fact that you're not buying it is key.
[02:40:56.182 --> 02:40:58.323]  And the fact that you're not demoralized is key.
[02:40:59.203 --> 02:41:05.566]  So just don't let them win and realize they've tried to suppress you and silence you because they fear you.
[02:41:06.866 --> 02:41:07.687]  And they fear the truth.
[02:41:08.367 --> 02:41:09.467]  And they think they can break your will.
[02:41:09.587 --> 02:41:10.948]  Don't let them break your will.
[02:41:12.773 --> 02:41:18.794]  Yeah, there's other fake polls out there saying 70% of Republicans don't believe election was free and fair.
[02:41:19.615 --> 02:41:24.916]  If you type in poll, 87% of Republicans.
[02:41:24.936 --> 02:41:25.676]  That's another poll.
[02:41:26.096 --> 02:41:26.196]  It's 87.
[02:41:26.336 --> 02:41:28.017]  It's in the stack from last week.
[02:41:28.297 --> 02:41:29.377]  It's a major scientific poll.
[02:41:31.477 --> 02:41:34.538]  And we're not going to stop.
[02:41:34.698 --> 02:41:38.119]  So if you go to InfoWars.com, there's a title for the show today.
[02:41:40.285 --> 02:41:41.505]  That hopefully you'll share.
[02:41:42.046 --> 02:41:45.527]  And I think the title of the broadcast says it all.
[02:41:47.407 --> 02:41:48.768]  Emergency transmission.
[02:41:49.888 --> 02:41:52.409]  Trump can still win, but he must act now.
[02:41:53.249 --> 02:41:54.549]  And he needs your help.
[02:41:58.030 --> 02:42:06.833]  By talking to high level White House sources, Alex Jones has gathered intel that confirms his independent analysis.
[02:42:10.140 --> 02:42:13.701]  Share this link if you want to be free and if you want to stop the globalist.
[02:42:15.542 --> 02:42:18.623]  Now, there is a path to victory.
[02:42:18.663 --> 02:42:19.544]  Trump really did win.
[02:42:19.664 --> 02:42:20.544]  All the evidence is there.
[02:42:21.064 --> 02:42:22.165]  The public's being gaslit.
[02:42:22.605 --> 02:42:34.890]  But we're going to have to get Trump to not be silent like he's been told to do, thinking that that's going to influence elections.
[02:42:37.571 --> 02:42:43.118]  What they're telling him is, if you speak out, the courts will say they're going to rule against you because you spoke.
[02:42:43.178 --> 02:42:44.440]  But the Democrats are all speaking.
[02:42:44.880 --> 02:42:46.062]  That's a fraud and that's a lie.
[02:42:46.522 --> 02:42:49.626]  So the Trump is really miscalculating right now, in my view, being silent.
[02:42:50.427 --> 02:42:53.070]  And I've got the inside baseball on how to stop these people.
[02:42:53.411 --> 02:42:55.013]  We'll break it down and get the number out when we come back.
[02:43:10.639 --> 02:43:12.020]  James in FEMA Region 1.
[02:43:12.300 --> 02:43:12.800]  You're on the air.
[02:43:12.840 --> 02:43:13.120]  Go ahead.
[02:43:13.240 --> 02:43:14.320]  Hey, God bless you, brother.
[02:43:14.340 --> 02:43:14.901]  How you doing?
[02:43:14.941 --> 02:43:17.602]  Man, you can cut the suspense with a knife, brother.
[02:43:17.762 --> 02:43:18.542]  Right on, man.
[02:43:18.582 --> 02:43:20.082]  Hey, first of all, product plug.
[02:43:20.142 --> 02:43:22.923]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion basically turned my life around, man.
[02:43:22.963 --> 02:43:24.344]  I've never felt better in my life.
[02:43:24.424 --> 02:43:24.944]  I'm 50.
[02:43:25.004 --> 02:43:25.284]  I feel 30.
[02:43:25.784 --> 02:43:26.485]  So kudos to you.
[02:43:26.525 --> 02:43:28.045]  I hope you keep cranking that product out.
[02:43:28.085 --> 02:43:30.466]  Tell us what Vitamin Mineral Fusion did for you, James.
[02:43:30.606 --> 02:43:32.287]  Well, you know, like I said, I'm 50 years old.
[02:43:32.347 --> 02:43:33.989]  I'm a single dad of two teen boys.
[02:43:34.069 --> 02:43:35.470]  And just life just drags you down.
[02:43:35.610 --> 02:43:36.210]  No energy.
[02:43:36.230 --> 02:43:38.052]  You know, just feeling lethargic all the time.
[02:43:38.092 --> 02:43:41.654]  And I tried over-the-counter or, you know, CVS type of vitamins.
[02:43:41.734 --> 02:43:42.835]  I didn't do anything.
[02:43:43.336 --> 02:43:46.498]  I, you know, started watching your show and decided I'd try it out.
[02:43:46.718 --> 02:43:49.680]  And man, I tell you what, I just feel so invigorated.
[02:43:49.700 --> 02:43:50.921]  You know, just lots of energy.
[02:43:51.001 --> 02:43:51.902]  I'm sleeping well.
[02:43:52.182 --> 02:43:53.403]  I don't get sick ever.
[02:43:53.503 --> 02:43:55.004]  Just an amazing, amazing product.
[02:43:55.065 --> 02:43:55.725]  I truly love it.
[02:43:55.745 --> 02:44:07.434]  Well, just so you know, we go to top nutritionists, top doctors, top scientists, top firms that are the best known, and we say, what is the best vitamin, mineral, amino acid thing for us to take and for us to sell to our audience?
[02:44:07.634 --> 02:44:09.556]  And it has a big cost in product for us.
[02:44:09.636 --> 02:44:11.897]  So again, the synthetic vitamins, the other stuff, they do nothing.
[02:44:11.917 --> 02:44:12.798]  That's what gives them a bad name.
[02:44:12.918 --> 02:44:14.399]  Good ones do incredible things.
[02:44:14.459 --> 02:44:16.821]  It's got the zinc, the vitamin D3, it's got everything in it.
[02:44:16.941 --> 02:44:18.262]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:44:18.322 --> 02:44:19.483]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:44:19.643 --> 02:44:20.124]  We'll be right back.
[02:44:39.209 --> 02:44:39.829]  I don't know.
[02:45:09.906 --> 02:45:10.387]  Thank you.
[02:46:00.407 --> 02:46:07.450]  Most of the world submitted to the unconstitutional criminal lockdowns directed by the Communist Chinese and the United Nations.
[02:46:08.011 --> 02:46:18.015]  And now because the slaves have proven themselves to be subservient, the worst Australian models of complete lockdowns where you can't even leave your house for months and months are being announced.
[02:46:18.535 --> 02:46:28.300]  And in Germany, the police are using giant armored tanks with water cannons to blast men, women, and children that protest the fact that Merkel, the dictator, has put them under her control.
[02:46:28.860 --> 02:46:31.802]  That's right, she's been rigging elections for years and years.
[02:46:31.822 --> 02:46:34.964]  And the same thing is coming here to the United States.
[02:46:35.044 --> 02:46:36.004]  This is world government.
[02:46:36.584 --> 02:46:40.927]  In Philadelphia, they've announced four people or more seen together will be arrested.
[02:46:41.267 --> 02:46:42.948]  They're announcing that Christmas is canceled.
[02:46:43.308 --> 02:46:45.470]  This is what the communist takeover looks like.
[02:46:45.490 --> 02:46:49.632]  To bankrupt you, to take rid of all your due process, and absolutely
[02:46:50.012 --> 02:46:53.133]  Transform the world into a prison planet.
[02:46:53.153 --> 02:46:55.094]  How long have we warned you about this?
[02:46:55.154 --> 02:46:56.554]  But you can fight back.
[02:46:56.674 --> 02:46:58.515]  America is the last bastion.
[02:46:58.575 --> 02:46:59.415]  Stop submitting!
[02:47:02.996 --> 02:47:07.097]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:07.617 --> 02:47:08.898]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:21.098 --> 02:47:27.625]  Well, you've got your diamonds and you've got your pretty clothes.
[02:47:28.706 --> 02:47:31.970]  And the chauffeur drives your car.
[02:47:32.791 --> 02:47:36.074]  You let everybody know.
[02:47:36.915 --> 02:47:42.521]  But don't play with me, cause you're playing with fire.
[02:47:46.984 --> 02:48:14.082]  I'm going to lay out how President Trump can defeat the globalists in his path to not letting them steal this election and fulfilling the will
[02:48:15.362 --> 02:48:16.383]  Of the voters and the people.
[02:48:17.143 --> 02:48:27.430]  And I'm going to do that at 6 after next hour because it's going to take... It's going to take a couple segments and then we're going to take your phone calls on what you think we should do and where you think we're at.
[02:48:27.570 --> 02:48:44.362]  But if you just tuned in on radio, you missed the video of the water cannons and the armored vehicles and the police attacking Germans who are being told that they've all got to go on welfare, they've all got to lose their jobs, they've got to move out of their houses, their businesses are not essential, they've got to basically starve to death.
[02:48:47.017 --> 02:49:00.220]  And at the same time, the politicians are all caught out at lavish hilltop dinners, not social distancing, not wearing masks, and they do that on purpose to train you that they are the new royalty.
[02:49:03.041 --> 02:49:12.603]  The horribly arrogant and fake, degenerate governor of New Jersey, and Lightfoot that says Pleasant Legion is the new world order.
[02:49:15.244 --> 02:49:16.444]  All these arrogant people,
[02:49:19.113 --> 02:49:20.053]  Think that they own you.
[02:49:22.315 --> 02:49:24.135]  And they're there to exercise it in your face.
[02:49:24.155 --> 02:49:26.457]  But we put a little compilation of this together.
[02:49:26.557 --> 02:49:30.258]  Sorry, not sorry, of Newsom and Lightfoot.
[02:49:30.298 --> 02:49:31.879]  I mean, there's hours of this.
[02:49:31.919 --> 02:49:33.240]  And the Philadelphia mayor.
[02:49:33.780 --> 02:49:34.981]  And Boris Johnson.
[02:49:37.202 --> 02:49:37.682]  All of them.
[02:49:41.264 --> 02:49:45.186]  All of them.
[02:49:46.106 --> 02:49:47.647]  Engaging in this type of behavior.
[02:49:49.622 --> 02:49:52.745]  As much as I like Metallica, I don't like it just firing randomly, but whatever.
[02:49:53.505 --> 02:50:03.935]  So, let's go ahead and go to that little piece that we put together of just a few of these hypocrites flaunting it in your face.
[02:50:06.024 --> 02:50:12.966]  Mayor Jim Kenney is apologizing after a photo surfaced on social media showing him dining indoors in Maryland this weekend.
[02:50:13.566 --> 02:50:17.147]  This photo showing Kenney seated at a table made the rounds on social media.
[02:50:17.307 --> 02:50:23.969]  Some criticized the mayor for dining indoors while Philadelphia restaurants are still prohibited from allowing customers inside.
[02:50:24.069 --> 02:50:28.250]  Democratic leaders getting slammed for not following their own coronavirus restrictions.
[02:50:28.470 --> 02:50:29.851]  I made a bad mistake.
[02:50:30.011 --> 02:50:37.856]  Instead of sitting down, I should have stood up and walked back, got in my car and drove back.
[02:50:38.016 --> 02:50:42.519]  The last thing that Mayor Lightfoot wanted to talk about today was getting a haircut.
[02:50:42.559 --> 02:50:46.662]  She didn't do a whole lot of talking about it, but she certainly didn't apologize for it either.
[02:50:46.882 --> 02:50:53.246]  But a photo that surfaced on social media showing the mayor after getting a trim has some asking, what about me?
[02:50:53.567 --> 02:50:57.089]  The mayor was asked at least twice about the haircut this afternoon.
[02:50:57.489 --> 02:50:58.991]  I'm out in the public eye.
[02:50:59.431 --> 02:51:04.756]  And, you know, I'm a person who, I take my personal hygiene very seriously.
[02:51:05.316 --> 02:51:08.719]  As I said, I felt like I needed to have a haircut.
[02:51:08.880 --> 02:51:16.847]  Nancy Pelosi is under fire today after a surveillance video shows her at a hair salon getting a blowout and not wearing a face mask.
[02:51:17.467 --> 02:51:19.529]  As it turns out, it was a setup.
[02:51:19.990 --> 02:51:23.273]  So I take responsibility for falling for a setup.
[02:51:26.738 --> 02:51:28.039]  The woman's going bankrupt.
[02:51:28.079 --> 02:51:29.880]  She's now lost her salon, last time I heard.
[02:51:31.441 --> 02:51:33.743]  But Pelosi, she says, oh, for me, you can be open.
[02:51:34.964 --> 02:51:41.529]  And this is a classic example of how evil thinks it can be separate from us and do what it wants but have us under other rules.
[02:51:41.549 --> 02:51:45.832]  And they're trying, psychologically, to condition us to accept that.
[02:51:45.872 --> 02:51:53.538]  I mean, Newsom just flew on taxpayer money for a week to Maui at a five-star hotel.
[02:51:54.312 --> 02:51:56.293]  I mean, I can't afford to stay at a place like that.
[02:51:56.393 --> 02:51:58.115]  It's like $1,000 a night rooms.
[02:51:59.336 --> 02:52:10.483]  He went there with hundreds of state staff, and they went to luau's and parties, and reportedly told everybody, oh, don't even wear a mask, wave it all, because it's crap.
[02:52:11.004 --> 02:52:14.186]  I always see headlines, oh, a state rep has announced her.
[02:52:15.287 --> 02:52:16.027]  Don Jr.
[02:52:16.047 --> 02:52:18.469]  has announced he's got COVID, is self-quarantining.
[02:52:18.489 --> 02:52:22.412]  It's like saying, oh, I've got a cold, I've got the flu, I'm self-quarantining.
[02:52:23.334 --> 02:52:25.254]  Oh, you get a lot of news attention when you say it.
[02:52:26.015 --> 02:52:28.675]  It's not 99.9% of people recover.
[02:52:30.395 --> 02:52:40.077]  The latest numbers, depending from Hawaii to Australia, is .000000 and then some numbers of real COVID deaths.
[02:52:40.837 --> 02:52:49.319]  Last time I checked, there's been 17 real deaths in Australia from actual COVID, of the thousand or so, everything else was heart attacks, cancer, you name it.
[02:52:50.896 --> 02:52:54.799]  But again, people cannot believe they're being lied to at this magnitude.
[02:52:54.839 --> 02:53:04.828]  Let me show you just some of these headlines, and I'll get the number out, and then later, after I've gotten into the election news and how to stop the globalists there, I will get into this more.
[02:53:05.108 --> 02:53:06.309]  But look at these headlines.
[02:53:07.370 --> 02:53:08.711]  It's not like people aren't fighting back.
[02:53:09.412 --> 02:53:13.535]  You've had all these federal and state judges say, you can't lock people down and say they're not essential.
[02:53:14.997 --> 02:53:16.498]  That's what Hitler said about the Jews.
[02:53:16.618 --> 02:53:17.339]  You're not essential.
[02:53:20.402 --> 02:53:21.782]  Useless eaters is the term.
[02:53:22.422 --> 02:53:28.464]  UK Supreme Court judge slams totalitarian COVID control freaks in government.
[02:53:28.704 --> 02:53:32.465]  Says it's illegal, it's out of control, and it's causing mass suicide and death.
[02:53:34.485 --> 02:53:39.846]  And there's all these hospitals completely empty, not doing heart surgeries for stents, for blocked arteries.
[02:53:40.686 --> 02:53:47.528]  They estimate just from heart attacks and non-treatment of cancer, there have been triple the numbers of deaths in Europe and the United States.
[02:53:47.588 --> 02:53:47.888]  Look it up.
[02:53:49.821 --> 02:53:51.743]  The hospitals are empty, and here's the big key.
[02:53:52.423 --> 02:53:58.528]  What do you think happens to the insurance companies, when for all over the world, for 10 months, they've been denying most care?
[02:53:58.548 --> 02:54:01.591]  Remember, oh, there was such a hysteria seven months ago?
[02:54:01.911 --> 02:54:09.858]  That, oh, if someone's having a heart attack, we're not gonna resuscitate, that was the headlines, because we might get COVID.
[02:54:10.318 --> 02:54:14.222]  Oh, I can't resuscitate, give you mouth-to-mouth, let you die.
[02:54:16.351 --> 02:54:17.591]  Oh, we're going to kill the old people.
[02:54:17.852 --> 02:54:19.012]  You can't go see them, though.
[02:54:19.152 --> 02:54:20.472]  We're going to bring COVID patients in.
[02:54:20.692 --> 02:54:21.813]  But you might have it, so you can't come in.
[02:54:22.033 --> 02:54:23.613]  It's about the death of logic.
[02:54:23.873 --> 02:54:26.254]  These are psychologists and psychiatrists running this.
[02:54:26.554 --> 02:54:27.255]  They admit it.
[02:54:27.435 --> 02:54:29.355]  They wrote books on it, and they're doing it.
[02:54:30.756 --> 02:54:32.476]  The average pop psychologist has no idea.
[02:54:32.496 --> 02:54:33.497]  It's just they're collecting your money.
[02:54:34.037 --> 02:54:43.500]  But the actual technocrats on top, the people like Steve Pachinick, who's been at the top of it, he'll tell you, it's all a sick joke.
[02:54:45.657 --> 02:54:46.358]  So here's the headlines.
[02:54:46.478 --> 02:54:49.601]  UK Supreme Court slams totalitarian COVID control freaks in government.
[02:54:51.863 --> 02:54:55.347]  COVID-19 is a vehicle for Democrats to control individuals.
[02:54:55.447 --> 02:54:58.110]  Oh, I'm glad Town Hall and the Republicans finally figured it out.
[02:54:58.570 --> 02:54:58.730]  L.A.
[02:54:58.770 --> 02:55:01.734]  County to shut down all indoor and outdoor dining before Thanksgiving.
[02:55:02.194 --> 02:55:05.878]  But don't worry, the wineries up north owned by Newsom, they'll stay open.
[02:55:07.227 --> 02:55:10.229]  California exempts Hollywood movie studios from COVID lockdowns.
[02:55:10.750 --> 02:55:11.510]  Everybody else though?
[02:55:11.630 --> 02:55:11.930]  Sorry.
[02:55:12.090 --> 02:55:12.431]  Closed.
[02:55:12.951 --> 02:55:14.993]  California's defy governor news some curfew order.
[02:55:15.253 --> 02:55:16.634]  Flood streets in 16 cities.
[02:55:16.934 --> 02:55:18.375]  Beautiful video we'll be playing coming up.
[02:55:21.617 --> 02:55:25.580]  Health officials make their final plea for holiday caution as coronavirus case spikes.
[02:55:25.600 --> 02:55:26.901]  They're not health officials.
[02:55:27.101 --> 02:55:32.325]  They're Democrat globalist political operatives in white lab coats trying to sell you a medical tyranny.
[02:55:33.956 --> 02:55:37.077]  Report, UN orders EU to get migrants vaccinated.
[02:55:37.437 --> 02:55:41.259]  Oh, they said the migrants and the black people are going to get the shot first.
[02:55:41.299 --> 02:55:42.219]  Black Lives Matter.
[02:55:42.459 --> 02:55:44.580]  Get ready for your flu shot and your COVID shot.
[02:55:45.041 --> 02:55:46.961]  And of course, there's special batches for you.
[02:55:48.182 --> 02:56:03.068]  I had the owner of the largest chain of pediatric facilities tell me 10 years ago that they were giving blacks in East Austin weaponized cancer virus filled polio.
[02:56:07.625 --> 02:56:08.746]  And he was like, excuse me?
[02:56:08.886 --> 02:56:09.626]  He'd been doing it mostly.
[02:56:09.666 --> 02:56:11.887]  He goes, wait a minute.
[02:56:11.907 --> 02:56:13.187]  This is 1960s live cancer?
[02:56:13.207 --> 02:56:13.308]  What?
[02:56:13.328 --> 02:56:14.368]  And they were like, shut up.
[02:56:15.488 --> 02:56:16.709]  He just told me don't say his name.
[02:56:18.330 --> 02:56:18.950]  You already know that.
[02:56:18.970 --> 02:56:22.872]  It was in AP last month that most of the polios from Bill Gates' vaccine, they still do it.
[02:56:23.192 --> 02:56:24.853]  And it's them giving them the same stuff in Africa.
[02:56:25.193 --> 02:56:26.153]  In the AP photo!
[02:56:28.254 --> 02:56:32.156]  Apple runs slave camps and is fighting legislation to stop them in the U.S.!
[02:56:32.536 --> 02:56:36.958]  But Tim Cook's like, I guess I'm kind of Tim Cookie and I'm wearing a black sweater today.
[02:56:38.660 --> 02:56:39.140]  Whoo!
[02:56:39.380 --> 02:56:40.761]  I mean, we're lordy, lordy.
[02:56:40.781 --> 02:56:41.922]  I haven't hit half of this.
[02:56:41.982 --> 02:56:42.742]  It's all coming up.
[02:56:44.323 --> 02:56:45.503]  It's all coming up next hour.
[02:56:45.563 --> 02:56:47.184]  Toll-free number to join us, 877-789-2539.
[02:56:47.204 --> 02:56:48.685]  First-time callers of the first round, 877-789-2539.
[02:56:48.705 --> 02:56:48.865]  877-789-Alex.
[02:56:48.885 --> 02:56:48.925]  877-789-2539.
[02:56:48.965 --> 02:56:49.305]  Separately.
[02:56:59.738 --> 02:57:00.939]  This is the last day.
[02:57:00.999 --> 02:57:02.259]  I've not come up with new specials.
[02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:05.281]  I have to end it, because almost all this stuff is about to sell out.
[02:57:05.921 --> 02:57:14.486]  Whether it's DNA Force Plus, whether it's Bodies, whether it's BioTruth Selenium, whether it's Ultra 12, whether it's SuperMetal Vitality, whether it's X2, they're all very close.
[02:57:14.927 --> 02:57:18.969]  What is in new is Alpha Power, after a year being sold out, we finally got that.
[02:57:18.989 --> 02:57:19.469]  It's amazing.
[02:57:20.370 --> 02:57:23.712]  VazoBeats is back in, but the main sale has to end today.
[02:57:23.732 --> 02:57:26.613]  I'll have a new sale tomorrow, but I've got to do this now.
[02:57:26.673 --> 02:57:27.794]  So take action and support us.
[02:57:29.065 --> 02:57:34.786]  Infowarsstore.com, Infowarsstore.com, or 888-253-3139, and get your DNA Force.
[02:57:34.867 --> 02:57:37.907]  Get your vitamin and mineral fusion.
[02:57:38.227 --> 02:57:39.048]  Boost your immune system.
[02:57:39.108 --> 02:57:42.929]  Experience what essential vitamins and nutrients that aren't from a synthetic source do for you.
[02:57:43.429 --> 02:57:45.089]  The globalists hope you don't defend yourself.
[02:57:45.309 --> 02:57:48.010]  Fauci hopes every day you die in a ditch.
[02:57:50.737 --> 02:57:57.040]  Urgent warnings are being issued right now by the United Nations, the Davos Group, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs.
[02:57:57.380 --> 02:58:02.923]  They're saying that the COVID virus is going to cause a global depression and hundreds of millions to starve to death.
[02:58:03.343 --> 02:58:04.063]  Incredible!
[02:58:04.584 --> 02:58:13.168]  They're the very organizations that ordered the global lockdowns that are causing the chain reaction that's causing the mass starvation, not the COVID virus.
[02:58:13.468 --> 02:58:14.188]  That is a fact.
[02:58:14.648 --> 02:58:19.871]  And all the hero sheep that wear the mask and go along with this are signing on to mass murder.
[02:58:20.231 --> 02:58:21.372]  Bigger than what Hitler did.
[02:58:21.772 --> 02:58:24.794]  That's when we got the Geneva Convention and the Nuremberg Code.
[02:58:25.234 --> 02:58:33.960]  This is a medical, world government, tyrannical takeover, causing starvation, setting up world IDs, and coming with forced inoculations.
[02:58:34.180 --> 02:58:39.203]  And now Bank of America says global unrest is sure to trigger an even bigger depression.
[02:58:39.263 --> 02:58:40.524]  That story's on Infowars.com.
[02:58:41.044 --> 02:58:49.310]  That's why it's vital for all of you to be public and to say you do not stand for this or the mass global genocide being caused by the planetary Great Reset.
[02:58:50.657 --> 02:58:53.801]  But seriously, proud of the crew hitting the push-ups during the break.
[02:58:54.663 --> 02:58:56.305]  Rob's gonna get an extra set in right now.
[02:58:56.806 --> 02:58:57.927]  Just hammering them away.
[02:58:57.947 --> 02:59:00.231]  He's at like 500 now, I think.
[02:59:01.592 --> 02:59:02.273]  Pretty decent number.
[02:59:04.133 --> 02:59:05.854]  Super male vitality.
[02:59:05.914 --> 02:59:06.954]  Look, I'm not even kidding you.
[02:59:07.034 --> 02:59:13.796]  Super male vitality every morning for me and every before workout, pre-workout for me as well.
[02:59:13.936 --> 02:59:21.598]  Sometimes that means I kind of double up because I'll wake right up, do my morning supplement routine, and then go to the gym right after that and just kind of double down on it.
[02:59:22.058 --> 02:59:26.740]  But when I work out at night, obviously, take the super male vitality.
[02:59:26.760 --> 02:59:27.620]  Yeah, there it is right there.
[02:59:27.640 --> 02:59:28.781]  I was wondering how you got to 500 so easily.
[02:59:30.921 --> 02:59:34.743]  The super male vitality right there at the desk.
[02:59:35.303 --> 02:59:36.104]  It only makes sense.
[02:59:36.124 --> 02:59:36.644]  Uh-oh.
[02:59:36.764 --> 02:59:37.684]  Oh, he's chugging it now.
[02:59:38.605 --> 02:59:41.026]  Well, thousand push-ups later.
[02:59:41.046 --> 02:59:45.608]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:15.983 --> 03:00:17.344]  Alright, we're back live.
[03:00:17.564 --> 03:00:31.294]  Well, one of the biggest airlines in the world, Qantas, CEO has said that they've talked to all the other big CEOs and you're going to be taking all the inoculations Bill Gates wants.
[03:00:31.354 --> 03:00:32.475]  Bill Gates is to be the head of the G7.
[03:00:33.697 --> 03:00:42.602]  The Prime Minister of England said that he will basically put Bill Gates in charge of the G7 for the next year to implement the Great Reset and build back better.
[03:00:43.222 --> 03:00:48.486]  And that means five vaccines to begin with that are mRNA that change your DNA.
[03:00:48.806 --> 03:00:49.546]  Not a vaccine.
[03:00:49.646 --> 03:00:54.249]  A deadly cancer infusion GMO takeover of your body.
[03:00:54.849 --> 03:00:56.550]  I mean, it's like the 1980s thing.
[03:00:57.010 --> 03:00:58.651]  You dig it up, it grabs you, it rewrites you.
[03:00:58.691 --> 03:01:02.594]  I mean, this is just the giant leap towards total takeover.
[03:01:05.165 --> 03:01:10.370]  They know you put up with the airports and the fondling of your children and all that, so now that's going to be the incubation center for this.
[03:01:10.930 --> 03:01:12.291]  God help us.
[03:01:13.853 --> 03:01:14.533]  No exemptions.
[03:01:14.553 --> 03:01:16.595]  You don't even have a... You don't have COVID tests.
[03:01:16.615 --> 03:01:17.015]  Doesn't matter.
[03:01:17.236 --> 03:01:23.621]  You're going to take in your body what we say, and Australia is the captive island, the captive continent.
[03:01:24.362 --> 03:01:25.022]  God help us.
[03:01:25.683 --> 03:01:29.326]  Qantas Airways CEOs says COVID vaccination will be mandatory for travel.
[03:01:29.366 --> 03:01:31.168]  Here, just hear it directly from this monster.
[03:01:33.424 --> 03:01:40.510]  Alan, when there is a vaccine, are you going to require all of your passengers to be vaccinated before they get on a plane?
[03:01:40.770 --> 03:01:49.597]  Yeah, we are looking at changing our terms and conditions to say for international travellers that we will ask people to have a vaccination before they can get on the aircraft.
[03:01:50.338 --> 03:01:51.799]  What do you need that domestically?
[03:01:52.200 --> 03:02:00.767]  We'll have to see what happens with COVID-19 in the market, but certainly for international visitors coming out and people leaving the country, we think that's a necessity.
[03:02:01.687 --> 03:02:03.169]  And then it'll be every other vaccine.
[03:02:03.509 --> 03:02:06.253]  Oh, here, show them this little group of headlines.
[03:02:06.573 --> 03:02:08.055]  Oh, the big corporations care so much.
[03:02:08.175 --> 03:02:10.197]  Apple says they want everybody to be forced inoculated.
[03:02:10.578 --> 03:02:12.140]  That's while Apple runs death camps.
[03:02:12.280 --> 03:02:16.084]  Apple lobbies Congress to weaken Bill, banning use of Chinese slaves to make iPhones.
[03:02:16.165 --> 03:02:16.725]  Oh, that's all right.
[03:02:16.765 --> 03:02:17.166]  They're liberal.
[03:02:17.907 --> 03:02:19.328]  Singapore halts dosing of...
[03:02:19.969 --> 03:02:26.175]  Two different flu shots that were 59 deaths in South Korea, but say it'll continue to be forced inoculation.
[03:02:26.216 --> 03:02:30.880]  Bill Gates says the world won't return to normal until everybody takes their vaccine.
[03:02:31.060 --> 03:02:32.622]  He says his vaccine.
[03:02:33.723 --> 03:02:40.851]  Oh, and by the way, I have him on a business channel bragging how this is the best investment ever is in vaccines and how his return is so big.
[03:02:42.037 --> 03:02:44.319]  And oh, there's all these deaths from the trials as well.
[03:02:44.359 --> 03:02:48.903]  But don't worry, Qantas CEO really is going to take great care of this.
[03:02:49.904 --> 03:02:54.569]  I'm going to come back and then I'll take calls in that segment and then I will hit.
[03:02:56.141 --> 03:02:57.142]  Trump's path to victory.
[03:02:57.162 --> 03:03:00.364]  Man, he's really been a bulwark against forced inoculations.
[03:03:00.404 --> 03:03:03.966]  He said he would try to block any companies trying to make you have a vaccine to travel.
[03:03:04.806 --> 03:03:06.107]  He said, if you want it, go ahead and take it.
[03:03:06.127 --> 03:03:07.368]  He recommends children not take it.
[03:03:07.388 --> 03:03:09.249]  He says, you know, children don't get sick from COVID.
[03:03:09.850 --> 03:03:10.210]  They don't.
[03:03:10.730 --> 03:03:18.515]  Even if you believe the whole COVID thing, they've turned the test up so high, though, that any viral infection you've had in years or bacterial will show it.
[03:03:19.585 --> 03:03:21.206]  But again, that's what all the scientists say, too.
[03:03:21.406 --> 03:03:24.167]  The majority of scientists say it's an overblown deception.
[03:03:24.567 --> 03:03:25.407]  I mean, think about what is it?
[03:03:25.447 --> 03:03:25.987]  Is it a hoax?
[03:03:27.808 --> 03:03:29.228]  A lot of the actions are hoaxes.
[03:03:29.248 --> 03:03:30.469]  A lot of the numbers are hoaxes.
[03:03:30.489 --> 03:03:33.130]  A lot of dead people die to something else, and then they say it's COVID.
[03:03:33.150 --> 03:03:33.710]  That's a hoax.
[03:03:33.730 --> 03:03:36.111]  But, no, it's a real virus owned by Bill Gates and Fauci.
[03:03:36.831 --> 03:03:47.155]  Oh, but Fauci's on 60 Minutes saying there's no evidence it came out of Wuhan because he ran 11 programs in Wuhan of specific gain-of-function, weaponized bird flu.
[03:03:49.378 --> 03:03:51.599]  and bat flu of the COVID strains.
[03:03:51.679 --> 03:03:54.380]  I mean, it's called smoking gun.
[03:03:55.300 --> 03:03:59.241]  It's like if the cops pull you over, there's blood all over you, nail marks on your face.
[03:04:01.382 --> 03:04:03.663]  They've got probable cause, reasonable suspicion.
[03:04:04.183 --> 03:04:10.565]  They put you in handcuffs, open the back trunk, your wife's dead with a bloody ax in there.
[03:04:12.626 --> 03:04:14.586]  You're going to the electric chair.
[03:04:14.706 --> 03:04:16.287]  You're going to lethal injection.
[03:04:17.315 --> 03:04:25.264]  And then they go back to the house and there's blood everywhere and her skin is under, your skin is under her fingernails.
[03:04:25.344 --> 03:04:27.646]  I mean, it's worse than that.
[03:04:28.427 --> 03:04:34.333]  They were running illegal COVID-19 research at Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[03:04:34.854 --> 03:04:35.475]  They moved it.
[03:04:36.856 --> 03:04:37.417]  They moved it.
[03:04:38.837 --> 03:04:40.498]  To... Wuhan!
[03:04:40.799 --> 03:04:44.221]  And then now they've used what they released to take everything over!
[03:04:44.462 --> 03:04:47.484]  And they admit it's the Great Reset to take control of you and your family!
[03:04:48.004 --> 03:04:48.465]  My God!
[03:04:48.505 --> 03:04:51.127]  They have to give me a confession live on TV?
[03:04:51.627 --> 03:04:53.068]  That's about the only thing they haven't done!
[03:04:53.089 --> 03:04:56.011]  Everybody knows super villains love to brag!
[03:04:56.351 --> 03:04:57.112]  Boy don't they!
[03:05:01.616 --> 03:05:10.902]  Climb to the top of the food chain with Alpha Power by Infowars Life for those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels.
[03:05:11.742 --> 03:05:19.107]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[03:05:19.788 --> 03:05:26.052]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[03:05:26.932 --> 03:05:32.179]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[03:05:32.800 --> 03:05:44.936]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia.
[03:05:45.616 --> 03:05:51.122]  Makaroo from Peru, Horny Goatweed from China, and Tribulus from India.
[03:05:51.903 --> 03:05:55.426]  Reach your alpha male potential with Alpha Power.
[03:05:56.007 --> 03:06:00.772]  Head to InfoWarsLife.com and secure your bottle today.
[03:06:06.374 --> 03:06:14.762]  I thought the leaden winter would bring you down forever, but you rode upon a steamer to the violence of the sun.
[03:06:16.050 --> 03:06:26.695]  Broadcasting live from the UN Stronghold, Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:29.596 --> 03:06:36.139]  Even if they try to remove President Trump with his fraud, the populist movements spreading across the world are stronger than ever.
[03:06:37.439 --> 03:06:43.542]  And now, you've got Boris Johnson, and you've got John Kerry, and you've got all these world leaders saying,
[03:06:44.963 --> 03:06:54.269]  The COVID-19 lockdown is a punishment to populists to bring them under control, and they admit it's a social movement, and Klaus Schwab says it's not a threat.
[03:06:54.429 --> 03:06:55.810]  COVID-19 is not a threat.
[03:06:57.631 --> 03:07:03.334]  That's why Justin Trudeau tells the UN in a 10-minute address, the full thing's on YouTube.
[03:07:04.495 --> 03:07:06.116]  Like, I wanted to air the whole thing, we never have time.
[03:07:06.136 --> 03:07:12.180]  I mean, he says even worse stuff than the little clip you see where he says, the Great Reset will help us politically take over for socialism.
[03:07:14.002 --> 03:07:14.822]  And we'll help the poor.
[03:07:15.122 --> 03:07:17.143]  He means by bankrupting everybody and making everybody poor.
[03:07:19.043 --> 03:07:22.624]  And then the New York Times has Trudeau up there saying, none of this exists, it's not real.
[03:07:23.505 --> 03:07:25.545]  And he gives an address saying it's conspiracy theories.
[03:07:25.565 --> 03:07:28.586]  You go, why would he say all that and then say it doesn't exist?
[03:07:29.366 --> 03:07:33.548]  He's telling his followers, listen, we're giving you marching orders.
[03:07:33.948 --> 03:07:38.249]  And then when the general public hears about it, we deny them and tell them to sit down and shut up.
[03:07:39.489 --> 03:07:41.710]  He's letting their people in on it.
[03:07:42.717 --> 03:07:43.717]  It's a power trip!
[03:07:44.098 --> 03:07:55.422]  I've been around even low-level Google employees, and they are really into the surveillance, and into the power, and into being in the club, and into lying to people.
[03:07:58.223 --> 03:08:02.984]  So, this is very diabolical, and I'm not trying to scare you.
[03:08:03.024 --> 03:08:03.685]  I'm being a realist.
[03:08:03.725 --> 03:08:04.745]  The bottom's falling out.
[03:08:05.965 --> 03:08:06.926]  If you study history,
[03:08:07.827 --> 03:08:14.073]  What's happened in Europe, what's happened in Africa, what's happened in Asia, what's happened in Latin America, Mesoamerica, before that, it's always the same.
[03:08:14.313 --> 03:08:15.114]  Things go in cycles.
[03:08:17.175 --> 03:08:26.924]  And having rulers that want to dominate and dumb people down and enslave people and torture people to death and not let people be educated and not let nobody ever wanted a middle class.
[03:08:30.107 --> 03:08:33.110]  No culture allowed a large middle class
[03:08:35.074 --> 03:08:45.260]  Until 550 years ago, in areas of what is England, Scotland, and Northern Europe.
[03:08:47.362 --> 03:08:51.184]  I mean, the Germans were still slaves until the 1870s.
[03:08:54.466 --> 03:08:55.407]  They were feudal serfs.
[03:08:55.447 --> 03:08:56.648]  They were owned by the crown.
[03:08:59.309 --> 03:09:01.871]  The serfs didn't get freed in Russia until around the same time.
[03:09:02.471 --> 03:09:03.372]  Serf means slave.
[03:09:06.172 --> 03:09:07.833]  Not a smurf, a surf.
[03:09:08.994 --> 03:09:17.138]  And so all they're doing is going back to a high-tech form of neo-feudalistic fascism.
[03:09:18.059 --> 03:09:22.381]  By the way, I coined the term neo-feudalistic fascism, and I'm not bragging, it's just true.
[03:09:22.401 --> 03:09:25.363]  I also coined a lot of the terms since Paul Watson was on like a week ago.
[03:09:25.383 --> 03:09:27.164]  And I go, what do you call this system?
[03:09:27.224 --> 03:09:27.704]  And he was like,
[03:09:29.255 --> 03:09:32.077]  It gave the term out that they're all using everywhere now in major publications.
[03:09:32.478 --> 03:09:39.663]  And that's real success is when you coined something 20 years ago and it comes back to you and is now in the vernacular.
[03:09:40.284 --> 03:09:41.505]  And by the way, I just want to give you some good news.
[03:09:41.525 --> 03:09:44.027]  We're going to go to your calls and get to the big news next segment.
[03:09:46.008 --> 03:09:46.909]  I've gotten calls.
[03:09:47.549 --> 03:09:52.333]  I get a lot of calls, but I've gotten calls from some of the biggest people out there.
[03:09:53.274 --> 03:09:54.475]  And they said, man, Alex,
[03:09:58.211 --> 03:09:58.851]  It's incredible.
[03:09:59.411 --> 03:10:08.014]  When I go to these dinner parties in New York or dinner parties in LA, or I'm talking to, you know, top people, household names, all they want to talk about is you.
[03:10:08.874 --> 03:10:10.094]  And all they want to talk about is the future.
[03:10:11.455 --> 03:10:17.076]  And this one individual this weekend was like, what's it like to have everybody now accepting you and celebrating you?
[03:10:17.096 --> 03:10:22.558]  And I'm like, it's good to know people are finally understanding we're not playing games.
[03:10:23.905 --> 03:10:25.706]  And I don't say that with a sense of a power trip.
[03:10:25.726 --> 03:10:27.327]  It's actually extremely dangerous.
[03:10:27.827 --> 03:10:32.509]  Do you understand that I get followed home every day by black SUVs?
[03:10:33.570 --> 03:10:42.194]  When I eat in restaurants, FBI and CIA, we ran it, we checked it, FBI and CIA come and sit next to us.
[03:10:42.214 --> 03:10:44.896]  And when I come over, they put masks on and say, have a good day, Mr. Jones.
[03:10:44.936 --> 03:10:45.876]  They go wait in the parking lot.
[03:10:47.257 --> 03:10:51.699]  If I walk out of my hotel and go across the street and have a hamburger, federal agents follow me in.
[03:10:52.099 --> 03:10:53.320]  And they want me to know they're there.
[03:10:54.889 --> 03:10:57.310]  This is the type of stuff that happened to Martin Luther King, okay?
[03:10:57.890 --> 03:11:02.332]  So, this is not a power trip I'm in, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:11:02.713 --> 03:11:07.515]  I only read their own documents and knew their plan, and I told you, and now it's coming true.
[03:11:07.895 --> 03:11:09.876]  That makes my credibility extremely high.
[03:11:10.316 --> 03:11:16.159]  But I want you to know, I need your prayers now, because this is the moment of mass awakening.
[03:11:16.739 --> 03:11:17.780]  And you wait till...
[03:11:19.013 --> 03:11:25.694]  They are killing thousands a day with the COVID-19 vaccine and saying it's an acceptable death rate.
[03:11:27.975 --> 03:11:31.295]  See, we've entered a whole new ballgame here where they're not going to try to hide stuff anymore.
[03:11:33.676 --> 03:11:43.857]  And the reason I'm telling you this is we're in the best of times, we're in the worst of times, and biblical things are now unfolding and now happening.
[03:11:43.897 --> 03:11:45.218]  I mean, I covered this last segment.
[03:11:45.578 --> 03:11:47.418]  Some stations don't carry that first little segment, but
[03:11:48.621 --> 03:11:51.482]  International Airlines are now announcing you won't be able to travel without the vaccine.
[03:11:52.962 --> 03:11:54.883]  And next is you won't be able to leave your house without the vaccine.
[03:11:56.384 --> 03:12:08.488]  And again, it's not a vaccine where they put a microwave or radiated cold virus in you that isn't able to replicate, and your body learns how to beat it, it can still cause an autoimmune response.
[03:12:08.508 --> 03:12:15.190]  It can still be contaminated with where it was grown.
[03:12:16.840 --> 03:12:18.941]  With other RNA and DNA.
[03:12:21.503 --> 03:12:23.104]  I mean, you can ask any woman.
[03:12:23.164 --> 03:12:27.587]  She better love the man she's with if he's not going to be wearing a condom.
[03:12:27.987 --> 03:12:29.508]  She must love him if she wants to get pregnant.
[03:12:30.009 --> 03:12:36.273]  Well, this is Bill Gates is going to put something not out of a man you love in you, but cooked up in a lab by this crazy person.
[03:12:36.613 --> 03:12:41.816]  And he says, oh, we're going to have hundreds of vaccines you're going to have to take and five COVID shots a year.
[03:12:43.337 --> 03:12:43.918]  And it's not.
[03:12:45.271 --> 03:12:46.713]  Even a vaccine.
[03:12:46.913 --> 03:12:49.196]  It is a mRNA vaccine.
[03:12:49.236 --> 03:12:53.360]  He says, oh, all these other ones, those don't let you travel.
[03:12:53.881 --> 03:12:56.424]  I say the one, and he's got four.
[03:12:56.564 --> 03:12:57.445]  Moderna's one of them.
[03:12:57.945 --> 03:12:58.706]  Pfizer's another.
[03:12:58.867 --> 03:13:00.749]  He's got four companies producing
[03:13:02.711 --> 03:13:07.794]  Imagine if aliens landed and they said, we'll let you travel, we'll let you live, we just want you to take a shot.
[03:13:07.814 --> 03:13:08.515]  You go, what does it do?
[03:13:08.915 --> 03:13:19.021]  Well, it goes into the nuclei of your cell and reprograms the DNA with a virus of your cell and we don't really know what it's going to do and it might make you sick.
[03:13:19.041 --> 03:13:20.242]  You go, I don't trust you.
[03:13:21.240 --> 03:13:24.742]  But one of the aliens said, well, here, watch our television broadcast.
[03:13:25.102 --> 03:13:27.964]  And the head alien's like, I want to reduce the population of the Earth.
[03:13:28.464 --> 03:13:29.664]  I want to get rid of these people.
[03:13:29.684 --> 03:13:30.405]  There's too many of them.
[03:13:30.665 --> 03:13:37.769]  You'd be like, whoa, the head alien says he wants to depopulate us and wants to get in our body.
[03:13:38.029 --> 03:13:40.790]  And now he's got a lockdown going, saying he will do it.
[03:13:40.850 --> 03:13:42.571]  I mean, he says he wants to kill you.
[03:13:42.831 --> 03:13:44.372]  He says he wants to do all this.
[03:13:45.633 --> 03:13:49.415]  His father, his mother, all of them were part of a eugenics cult on record.
[03:13:50.933 --> 03:13:55.857]  And now he's up here saying, even when you take the shot, things don't go back to normal, and you are not essential.
[03:13:56.337 --> 03:13:57.498]  I am the great alien chief.
[03:13:57.838 --> 03:13:59.139]  I will put something in your body.
[03:13:59.460 --> 03:14:00.380]  It may make you sick.
[03:14:00.661 --> 03:14:02.262]  By the way, there are too many of you.
[03:14:03.323 --> 03:14:04.283]  I'm here to save you.
[03:14:04.424 --> 03:14:05.705]  There are too many of you.
[03:14:07.946 --> 03:14:11.069]  And by the way, you're not essential.
[03:14:11.329 --> 03:14:14.531]  I mean, that's what an alien would say to you.
[03:14:14.591 --> 03:14:16.213]  Now, I don't know what Bill Gates is.
[03:14:17.858 --> 03:14:20.720]  But he might as well have walked off a giant flying saucer.
[03:14:22.240 --> 03:14:23.421]  And that's basically what this is.
[03:14:23.461 --> 03:14:27.463]  The globalist Satan's a fallen entity, the Bible tells us, that comes to do this.
[03:14:27.743 --> 03:14:33.927]  And Satan has said to the kings of the earth, I'll give you power, and I'll keep you in charge, and I'll give you life extension.
[03:14:35.388 --> 03:14:38.409]  But all you've got to do is kill the humans.
[03:14:38.749 --> 03:14:41.051]  And by the way, you're a failed species.
[03:14:41.791 --> 03:14:46.694]  You've got to merge with machines, like I am, and become silicon.
[03:14:48.308 --> 03:14:50.189]  That is on record.
[03:14:52.270 --> 03:14:54.651]  Wall Street Journal, New York Times, Bard Magazine.
[03:14:55.031 --> 03:14:56.492]  Looking forward to the end of humanity.
[03:14:56.692 --> 03:14:57.913]  Looking forward to the end of humans.
[03:14:58.073 --> 03:14:58.993]  Humans are parasites.
[03:14:59.153 --> 03:15:00.134]  We should be exterminated.
[03:15:02.115 --> 03:15:02.455]  Remember?
[03:15:03.956 --> 03:15:12.780]  When Dr. Bianca, the head of the biology department at UT 15 years ago, gave speeches about airborne Ebola and how he wanted to kill 98% of the population, and the FBI visiting back then actually did their job?
[03:15:15.256 --> 03:15:25.399]  And his graduate student, we later learned, wrote an article attacking me, works at a bioweapons lab in California, a level 4 lab, and she wrote an article saying, Dr. Pianka's too liberal.
[03:15:25.919 --> 03:15:30.361]  Who can deny humans are parasites and should all be eradicated?
[03:15:31.121 --> 03:15:32.262]  Who is this one?
[03:15:32.502 --> 03:15:37.964]  She's talking about us like we're bad and she's this God, but that's all mind control.
[03:15:38.284 --> 03:15:42.106]  She's a human too, but she has a spirit, an avatar.
[03:15:42.446 --> 03:15:46.727]  She's like a Martian coming off with Mars attacks, killing people.
[03:15:49.609 --> 03:15:52.930]  And once you get that, I've talked to generals, all of them, they've woken up now.
[03:15:53.210 --> 03:15:55.751]  They're like, my God, once we shift to this, it's alien.
[03:15:55.971 --> 03:15:56.572]  Everyone gets it.
[03:15:56.772 --> 03:15:57.252]  It's alien.
[03:15:57.572 --> 03:15:58.072]  It's alien.
[03:15:58.352 --> 03:15:58.792]  It's alien.
[03:15:59.133 --> 03:15:59.533]  It's alien.
[03:16:16.049 --> 03:16:17.829]  The New World Order's now out in the open.
[03:16:18.750 --> 03:16:23.230]  We're leaving the good old days of self-defense and family and even being healthy.
[03:16:23.611 --> 03:16:24.711]  Cancer rates are exploding.
[03:16:24.811 --> 03:16:25.691]  Autism's exploding.
[03:16:26.351 --> 03:16:27.511]  The 5G's going in.
[03:16:27.551 --> 03:16:30.592]  The GMO's being served up on your school lunch program plates.
[03:16:31.212 --> 03:16:34.233]  Everything's going to be free in the New World Order, because it's all going to be poison.
[03:16:34.633 --> 03:16:35.613]  It's all Trojan horses.
[03:16:36.333 --> 03:16:37.894]  This is the AI takeover.
[03:16:38.314 --> 03:16:41.274]  Remember, we were supposed to get all the automation machines and only work two days a week?
[03:16:41.654 --> 03:16:44.295]  Instead, you're going to work six, seven days a week, but it's all going to be free.
[03:16:45.492 --> 03:16:49.493]  Yeah, it's going to be free from your choices and free from your will being involved in it.
[03:16:49.973 --> 03:16:56.335]  That's why humanity's awakening and you're seeing mass exoduses away from the blue cities and the blue states.
[03:16:56.835 --> 03:17:11.559]  All over the world people are fleeing globalism and many of the leftists that are now traveling to the countryside are apologizing to people and realizing that they were brainwashed and understanding that once they signed on to globalism and were promised with their degrees that they'd be part of this new utopian ruling class,
[03:17:12.793 --> 03:17:12.853]  The
[03:17:29.173 --> 03:17:33.155]  In positions actually helping people, now they know it was all a lie.
[03:17:33.175 --> 03:17:40.260]  And they're going, wait, all these big billionaires that don't pay taxes, now say they're going to transcend humans entirely and merge with machines?
[03:17:40.840 --> 03:17:42.441]  But first they've got to mop up the humans?
[03:17:43.021 --> 03:17:45.623]  You know, first it was get rid of half the population in the 60s.
[03:17:45.923 --> 03:17:48.024]  Now it was in the 80s, get rid of 80%.
[03:17:48.444 --> 03:17:51.166]  Now Ted Turner and Bill Gates say 95% in public statements.
[03:17:52.947 --> 03:17:55.009]  I've talked to individuals that have been in the rooms with them.
[03:17:55.489 --> 03:17:57.932]  They're talking about total human exterminism.
[03:17:58.112 --> 03:18:01.355]  Hell, now it's even the Wall Street Journal looking forward to the end of humanity.
[03:18:02.196 --> 03:18:03.056]  This is their cult.
[03:18:03.837 --> 03:18:08.301]  And yes, they've stolen all the money, they've got the resources because they're James Bond villains for real.
[03:18:08.882 --> 03:18:16.569]  But if we simply are aware of them and expose them and educate people that this is the real world system I'm talking about, we can defeat them.
[03:18:17.810 --> 03:18:21.632]  Their plan may succeed because it's so over-the-top evil, people can't believe it's actually happening.
[03:18:21.752 --> 03:18:23.093]  But that's also the weakness in it.
[03:18:23.173 --> 03:18:29.196]  If we simply do the research, and face the facts, and understand that they're not legitimate authorities, they're evil.
[03:18:30.136 --> 03:18:32.357]  Also, you need to keep InfoWars on the air.
[03:18:32.377 --> 03:18:37.320]  You see, everybody else didn't have their own platform, almost everybody else is getting shut down, and now the censorship's accelerating.
[03:18:37.740 --> 03:18:41.242]  So spread the word about BandotVideo and InfoWars.com, because that's how you resist.
[03:18:41.642 --> 03:18:41.762]  And,
[03:18:42.659 --> 03:18:43.241]  Get prepared.

[03:19:04.689 --> 03:19:09.232]  We went out and found the highest quality, best packaged, storable foods out there for the price.
[03:19:09.512 --> 03:19:11.714]  You can find stuff, again, costs three, four times as much.
[03:19:11.954 --> 03:19:12.675]  That's gourmet.
[03:19:12.775 --> 03:19:14.035]  All of it tastes incredibly good.
[03:19:14.656 --> 03:19:16.157]  This stuff, a lot of it tastes amazing.
[03:19:16.177 --> 03:19:17.037]  A lot of it tastes decent.
[03:19:17.258 --> 03:19:18.438]  I mean, it's quality.
[03:19:18.478 --> 03:19:18.679]  It's good.
[03:19:18.699 --> 03:19:20.260]  It's what I have for my family and others.
[03:19:20.520 --> 03:19:22.121]  And it's got good, healthy ingredients.

[03:19:30.225 --> 03:19:31.566]  They're doing one of those rare sales.
[03:19:31.586 --> 03:19:33.467]  They haven't done one of these in years until a few months ago.
[03:19:33.487 --> 03:19:34.807]  Now they're bringing the special back.

[03:20:02.670 --> 03:20:08.576]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:27.182 --> 03:20:32.348]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:20:33.950 --> 03:20:38.656]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:40.931 --> 03:20:42.192]  Emergency transmission.
[03:20:42.252 --> 03:20:43.273]  Trump can still win.
[03:20:43.814 --> 03:20:44.454]  He must act now.
[03:20:44.474 --> 03:20:45.055]  He needs your help.
[03:20:45.755 --> 03:20:50.239]  And I'm not planting a hook, as they say in the media, saying, oh, this is coming up, this is coming up, and not getting to it.
[03:20:50.259 --> 03:20:51.961]  I've covered a lot of important things.
[03:20:52.702 --> 03:20:55.364]  Last segment of this hour is the longest segment.
[03:20:55.384 --> 03:20:56.385]  It's 11 minutes long.
[03:20:57.105 --> 03:21:06.574]  I will cover Trump's path to victory and how we can help him and what the real stakes are and what we're facing and just absolute
[03:21:08.416 --> 03:21:14.034]  Inside intel on what Trump really thinks, why Trump isn't out in the public, and what his top lawyers are saying and doing.
[03:21:15.009 --> 03:21:18.711]  I think you've noticed some of Trump's lawyers have retweeted my speeches and things like that.
[03:21:19.332 --> 03:21:21.813]  I've been talking to some of these guys, and I'm going to leave it at that.
[03:21:21.833 --> 03:21:22.734]  I'm not going to say any names.
[03:21:23.134 --> 03:21:24.235]  And I know the real strategy.
[03:21:25.195 --> 03:21:26.116]  And I know what Trump's doing.
[03:21:26.136 --> 03:21:29.838]  And I agree with about 90% of it, but part of it's wrong, and I've told them this.
[03:21:30.559 --> 03:21:33.861]  So, I'm going to give it to you straight, as best I can.
[03:21:33.881 --> 03:21:34.641]  Doesn't mean I'm perfect.
[03:21:34.661 --> 03:21:36.382]  We all see the rose-colored darklies.
[03:21:36.402 --> 03:21:38.924]  But I'm going to your calls this segment, the next, then next hour.
[03:21:38.964 --> 03:21:39.644]  Nothing but calls.
[03:21:39.664 --> 03:21:40.565]  But let's do this right now.
[03:21:43.407 --> 03:21:55.210]  Remember Trump said a few months ago, three months ago, at a washing machine factory, a plant, he said, listen, I found out China isn't even doing the big markup.
[03:21:55.270 --> 03:21:58.431]  It's the middlemen are getting more money than China or even our U.S.
[03:21:58.471 --> 03:21:58.811]  companies.
[03:21:59.131 --> 03:22:00.351]  We're cutting out the middlemen.
[03:22:00.871 --> 03:22:03.072]  Americans shouldn't pay triple for drugs what others do.
[03:22:04.452 --> 03:22:08.613]  He says they're really pissed at me and you probably aren't going to be seeing me a lot soon.
[03:22:11.414 --> 03:22:12.475]  He already thought all this out.
[03:22:12.555 --> 03:22:13.856]  He knew they were going to steal the election.
[03:22:14.136 --> 03:22:15.437]  He knew they were already putting out the ballots.
[03:22:15.477 --> 03:22:15.997]  He already knew.
[03:22:16.437 --> 03:22:17.258]  He didn't back down.
[03:22:18.238 --> 03:22:22.081]  And I just really respect him.
[03:22:22.461 --> 03:22:25.082]  He believes a plan to have the Supreme Court prove this a fraud.
[03:22:25.102 --> 03:22:25.783]  He has the evidence.
[03:22:26.423 --> 03:22:27.544]  But the media keeps saying there's no evidence.
[03:22:27.564 --> 03:22:28.224]  It's just so much.
[03:22:29.865 --> 03:22:36.409]  But he's lost cases where he says something and the court says it influenced the case so they didn't.
[03:22:37.030 --> 03:22:37.710]  Well, that's BS!
[03:22:39.252 --> 03:22:41.973]  I'll explain in the final segment of this hour, but you can see it.
[03:22:42.453 --> 03:22:45.714]  The Democrats, the Globalists, they can all say whatever they want, but the President can't talk?
[03:22:46.935 --> 03:22:48.895]  If that's the case, those courts are going to rule against him anyways.
[03:22:49.756 --> 03:22:58.458]  So it all does come down to the Supreme Court, and if they can threaten the lawyers with death threats and lawsuits and disbarring, it's all happening.
[03:22:58.619 --> 03:23:02.540]  You know, there wasn't any evidence the Democrats wouldn't be pulling out all the stops to stop the lawyers.
[03:23:02.760 --> 03:23:03.520]  No, there's evidence.
[03:23:04.000 --> 03:23:08.142]  I mean, I was up here, not complaining, on Sunday, like 12 hours.
[03:23:09.571 --> 03:23:23.676]  Watching hours of depositions and eyewitnesses from Pennsylvania and Michigan, and Rob Dews putting like a 13-minute compilation of these hours of video affidavits up with just eyewitnesses to it all.
[03:23:23.816 --> 03:23:25.316]  I mean, just insane stuff.
[03:23:25.576 --> 03:23:32.138]  That'll be on Mandaw Video, but... We're putting up a heroic effort right now.
[03:23:32.839 --> 03:23:36.560]  And I just hope you as listeners understand, you are so important.
[03:23:37.819 --> 03:23:40.621]  Imagine if President Trump tried to give a speech to a million people.
[03:23:41.221 --> 03:23:43.002]  I was trying to give a speech to 500,000 people.
[03:23:43.202 --> 03:23:45.424]  Only a fraction could hear it, even though they had big speakers.
[03:23:45.784 --> 03:23:46.904]  Maybe 100,000 could hear it.
[03:23:47.825 --> 03:23:48.225]  In D.C.
[03:23:48.265 --> 03:23:48.766]  last weekend.
[03:23:48.806 --> 03:23:49.846]  Not this weekend, but last weekend.
[03:23:50.066 --> 03:23:50.567]  Eight days ago.
[03:23:51.147 --> 03:23:51.647]  Nine days ago.
[03:23:53.508 --> 03:23:55.770]  Well, imagine if Trump didn't have any amplifier.
[03:23:58.271 --> 03:24:02.914]  Only the first ten rows would hear it, then you'd have to repeat it, and then by the game of telephone, it would all be lost.
[03:24:04.435 --> 03:24:06.176]  You are the speaker system.
[03:24:07.489 --> 03:24:13.796]  So I can sit up here all day long and talk about stuff when you decide to spread the word and when you decide to share the info and download it and save it?
[03:24:13.816 --> 03:24:16.478]  Because there may be a come a time we're not here.
[03:24:16.498 --> 03:24:22.505]  I mean, I've been waiting a while to say this may be my last broadcast, and I've never done that in 27 years on air.
[03:24:22.985 --> 03:24:24.407]  Tomorrow, I'm going to have discipline.
[03:24:24.467 --> 03:24:27.510]  I'm going to do my last broadcast ever, hypothetically, because it could be.
[03:24:29.246 --> 03:24:29.986]  I mean, now's the time.
[03:24:30.446 --> 03:24:31.887]  I'm under full surveillance.
[03:24:31.947 --> 03:24:32.587]  They want me to know.
[03:24:33.268 --> 03:24:33.488]  Great.
[03:24:33.808 --> 03:24:35.408]  I want you to know your kids are all going to die of cancer.
[03:24:35.588 --> 03:24:36.189]  I wish they weren't.
[03:24:36.909 --> 03:24:37.749]  Go ahead, FBI agents.
[03:24:37.989 --> 03:24:39.190]  Load your kids up and watch it.
[03:24:39.490 --> 03:24:41.411]  And remember, when you're burying them, you did it!
[03:24:41.611 --> 03:24:42.731]  You killed your own children!
[03:24:42.751 --> 03:24:46.453]  So, you know, that's where this country is.
[03:24:46.673 --> 03:24:48.153]  You go ahead and sign on to Bill Gates.
[03:24:48.373 --> 03:24:48.773]  You go ahead.
[03:24:48.813 --> 03:24:49.834]  I'm signed on to Jesus.
[03:24:50.934 --> 03:24:53.515]  I want people to know, it's counting down now, folks.
[03:24:53.595 --> 03:24:54.596]  This is the takeover.
[03:24:54.796 --> 03:24:55.656]  The end of the republic.
[03:24:56.716 --> 03:24:58.057]  With a damn CHICOM agent.
[03:25:01.752 --> 03:25:02.592]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[03:25:03.492 --> 03:25:04.273]  Go ahead.
[03:25:06.373 --> 03:25:07.614]  Eli's on the same subject.
[03:25:07.654 --> 03:25:09.414]  In Indiana, one of InfoWords has taken out.
[03:25:09.434 --> 03:25:09.794]  Go ahead.
[03:25:12.095 --> 03:25:12.915]  Hello, Alex?
[03:25:13.215 --> 03:25:13.975]  Yes, you're on the air.
[03:25:14.736 --> 03:25:19.777]  Hi, yeah, it's El, and it's all, I go by El, but it's Andrea El.
[03:25:20.117 --> 03:25:21.317]  Wow, I can't believe I got through.
[03:25:21.337 --> 03:25:31.100]  So, really, my big question is, I'm wondering, like, what, how are we supposed to get our information if they succeed in shutting down
[03:25:34.091 --> 03:25:34.672]  Then she hung up.
[03:25:34.792 --> 03:25:35.052]  Okay.
[03:25:35.272 --> 03:25:36.093]  Well, sorry, ma'am.
[03:25:36.153 --> 03:25:36.714]  Very bizarre.
[03:25:37.374 --> 03:25:38.255]  But it's a good question.
[03:25:39.336 --> 03:25:40.998]  How are you supposed to get your information?
[03:25:43.420 --> 03:25:44.922]  Well, it's like you're a French citizen in 1942.
[03:25:45.582 --> 03:25:47.424]  You know the Nazis are bad.
[03:25:47.644 --> 03:25:48.665]  You know they're damn liars.
[03:25:51.288 --> 03:25:51.888]  They're the enemy.
[03:25:53.050 --> 03:25:55.992]  The entire corporate media, all of it, are traitors, bought and paid for.
[03:25:56.213 --> 03:25:57.314]  This is a corporate takeover.
[03:25:58.151 --> 03:26:00.192]  You're like, whoa, Corporate Tagger, that's not bad, we'll play golf.
[03:26:00.692 --> 03:26:05.193]  But you Genesis lunatics that want to be your doctor and say they want to depopulate you.
[03:26:06.354 --> 03:26:07.074]  I'll go to your calls.
[03:26:07.834 --> 03:26:09.035]  Talk to Dave in New York.
[03:26:09.075 --> 03:26:09.795]  Dave, thanks for holding.
[03:26:09.815 --> 03:26:10.135]  Go ahead.
[03:26:11.275 --> 03:26:12.936]  Hey, Alex, thanks for having me.
[03:26:14.456 --> 03:26:16.677]  I just can't believe this is going on.
[03:26:17.137 --> 03:26:20.378]  You're saying he needs to act now or we need to act now.
[03:26:20.459 --> 03:26:21.479]  It's almost too late.
[03:26:21.519 --> 03:26:27.641]  You're living under the threat of a Biden administration and their Department of Justice.
[03:26:28.666 --> 03:26:29.527]  That's ridiculous.
[03:26:29.547 --> 03:26:30.688]  We had four years.
[03:26:31.268 --> 03:26:32.629]  We had the Attorney General.
[03:26:32.669 --> 03:26:33.870]  We had the DOJ.
[03:26:34.931 --> 03:26:39.194]  There were so many things that we could have taken the moral high ground back on.
[03:26:39.214 --> 03:26:41.155]  They were all bred coward lawyers.
[03:26:41.816 --> 03:26:43.197]  All bred to be wimps.
[03:26:43.777 --> 03:26:44.978]  All bred to glad hand.
[03:26:45.038 --> 03:26:46.879]  And now the commies are taking us because we're weak.
[03:26:47.600 --> 03:26:48.700]  These lawyers are about to find out.
[03:26:48.741 --> 03:26:50.602]  They're about to be all just totally taken over.
[03:26:51.209 --> 03:26:55.072]  We woke up every morning saying when the arrests are going to come.
[03:26:55.512 --> 03:26:59.195]  Trump said during a debate, if I was president, you'd be in jail.
[03:26:59.596 --> 03:27:00.136]  To Hillary.
[03:27:00.476 --> 03:27:02.658]  And he just couldn't get, he didn't have enough good men.
[03:27:02.678 --> 03:27:03.639]  He had just too many cowards.
[03:27:04.241 --> 03:27:07.884]  Either that or Javonko or whatever, but we shouldn't even be here.
[03:27:08.485 --> 03:27:10.526]  And I know God's going to win.
[03:27:10.747 --> 03:27:12.068]  I know I'm with Jesus too.
[03:27:12.408 --> 03:27:13.049]  We all are.
[03:27:13.229 --> 03:27:18.133]  And this will create a backlash, but you should not be living under the threat of a Biden administration.
[03:27:18.173 --> 03:27:19.814]  Listen, I'm not even worried about myself.
[03:27:21.336 --> 03:27:26.921]  Bill Gates says, I'm going to give you a shot and you're going to get sick and I'm still going to lock you down.
[03:27:27.181 --> 03:27:29.643]  He's telling you he's coming to hurt you.
[03:27:29.663 --> 03:27:30.724]  I appreciate your call.
[03:27:32.790 --> 03:27:34.410]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Delaware.
[03:27:34.450 --> 03:27:35.231]  John, thanks for holding.
[03:27:36.651 --> 03:27:37.331]  What's up, Alex?
[03:27:37.831 --> 03:27:39.031]  Man, worldwide broadcast, brother.
[03:27:39.051 --> 03:27:40.652]  Thanks for calling.
[03:27:40.672 --> 03:27:53.714]  I just want to start off by saying I want everybody who voted to remember that they spit in every single one of our faces that stood in that line to try to make our voice heard.
[03:27:54.475 --> 03:27:55.555]  Every single one.
[03:27:55.955 --> 03:27:59.416]  And I've talked to a lot of people who are saying, you know, we'll get them in 24.
[03:27:59.456 --> 03:27:59.756]  No, we won't.
[03:28:01.218 --> 03:28:05.420]  Now is the time, and we need to prepare.
[03:28:05.460 --> 03:28:06.261]  John, don't hang up.
[03:28:06.281 --> 03:28:07.161]  I'm going to come right back to you.
[03:28:07.201 --> 03:28:08.062]  You deserve some time.
[03:28:08.422 --> 03:28:10.663]  What John is saying is what I'm meant to start the show with today.
[03:28:12.404 --> 03:28:13.904]  Look, they're stealing this, folks.
[03:28:13.985 --> 03:28:19.547]  This is a mass criminal action with total censorship, forced inoculations, permanent lockdowns, they admit.
[03:28:19.807 --> 03:28:21.588]  They admit it's political to their own people now.
[03:28:21.829 --> 03:28:22.529]  The Great Reset.
[03:28:22.969 --> 03:28:23.269]  Okay?
[03:28:23.409 --> 03:28:24.030]  Build Back Better.
[03:28:24.450 --> 03:28:25.911]  This is siege to destroy us.
[03:28:26.491 --> 03:28:28.352]  They're not going to back down now.
[03:28:29.701 --> 03:28:35.606]  This is, to quote Shakespeare, cry havoc, and let loose the dogs of war.
[03:28:35.966 --> 03:28:38.369]  This is high-tech, psy-op fear war.
[03:28:39.329 --> 03:28:42.832]  And the fact is, we've got such a soft population, they don't even know what's about to hit them.
[03:28:43.213 --> 03:28:47.597]  My God, I've been studying this my whole life, and waiting for this moment to fight, and I can barely handle it.
[03:28:47.957 --> 03:28:49.398]  People just can't handle the horror.
[03:28:49.799 --> 03:28:53.442]  But it's gonna get really bad, and then finally they'll wake up in that re-education camp.
[03:28:53.782 --> 03:28:55.864]  We'll win, but hundreds of millions are gonna die.
[03:29:00.973 --> 03:29:05.656]  Throughout history, there have been two basic forms of civilizations and different mixes of the two.
[03:29:06.137 --> 03:29:08.538]  One is born of renaissance, the other is born of conquest.
[03:29:09.179 --> 03:29:17.564]  One bases its power on having strong, enlightened, focused people with an ethos and a culture and ingenuity, art and skill and strength.
[03:29:18.245 --> 03:29:23.629]  The other is based on the massive number of slaves it controls with a tiny elite above it.
[03:29:24.609 --> 03:29:32.179]  America is transferring out of a system based on the ethos of liberty and freedom into one of total mass high-tech slavery.
[03:29:32.720 --> 03:29:35.924]  That's why the globalists tell us America was founded on slavery when it wasn't.
[03:29:36.324 --> 03:29:40.590]  They point out one of our evils so they can invert the fact that they are truly the slave masters.
[03:29:41.150 --> 03:29:42.851]  A global permanent lockdown is here.
[03:29:42.871 --> 03:29:45.772]  It is already causing millions and millions to starve to death.
[03:29:46.292 --> 03:29:47.893]  When they're done, billions will starve to death.
[03:29:48.453 --> 03:29:56.056]  Even the former head of the Ministry of Defense in England and a top general have come out and said the COVID lockdown is going to trigger a giant new world war.
[03:29:56.316 --> 03:29:56.996]  That's the facts.
[03:29:57.116 --> 03:29:59.057]  This is the Bill Gates New World Order weapon.

[03:31:49.616 --> 03:31:53.721]  But whatever you do, take action now, spread the word, and pray for Infowars.
[03:31:53.901 --> 03:31:56.764]  Because we're Americans, we're humans, and we're not backing down.
[03:31:56.944 --> 03:31:58.687]  And the New World Order can burn in hell!
[03:31:59.790 --> 03:32:08.016]  We here at InfoWars are proud to announce the first ever Kava Kava Root Supplement that is now available at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:32:08.256 --> 03:32:18.484]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs in the natural health world today, though it has been used for hundreds of years in the Pacific Islands for its relaxation and euphoric effects.
[03:32:18.804 --> 03:32:28.452]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[03:32:28.792 --> 03:32:34.513]  The Samoan people would drink kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little.
[03:32:34.754 --> 03:32:39.335]  Nowadays, kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[03:32:39.615 --> 03:32:47.797]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only kava kava, but other herbs including, but not limited to,
[03:32:48.217 --> 03:32:52.740]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:17.105 --> 03:33:30.969]  We are on a very, very fast timetable for a global cashless society, medical dictatorship, that will openly force-inoculate and poison and kill the population with slow-kill operations.
[03:33:33.170 --> 03:33:34.411]  These are military attacks.
[03:33:35.671 --> 03:33:37.592]  Violate the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code.
[03:33:37.632 --> 03:33:38.612]  It's absolutely illegal.
[03:33:40.152 --> 03:33:43.554]  And so, they are preparing offensive, violent operations against everyone.
[03:33:44.074 --> 03:33:44.714]  This is not a drill.
[03:33:46.817 --> 03:33:50.419]  The good news is a lot of courts and a lot of leaders are saying it's martial law and it's tyranny.
[03:33:52.340 --> 03:33:56.983]  UK Supreme Court judge slams totalitarian COVID control freaks in government.
[03:33:58.363 --> 03:33:59.904]  They call it a medical dictatorship.
[03:33:59.964 --> 03:34:00.505]  That's what it is.
[03:34:01.265 --> 03:34:04.167]  A multinational corporate medical dictatorship.
[03:34:04.207 --> 03:34:06.068]  These are corporate governance officers.
[03:34:07.145 --> 03:34:08.325]  They're saying, you want to get on an airplane?
[03:34:08.666 --> 03:34:09.746]  You will take the shots.
[03:34:10.146 --> 03:34:16.849]  But more importantly than the shot, it's the ID and the medical scanning that you've got to be under their control to have mobility.
[03:34:17.729 --> 03:34:19.329]  And it's all surveilled by Big Tech.
[03:34:19.990 --> 03:34:21.770]  Big Tech runs slave camps in China.
[03:34:21.910 --> 03:34:22.350]  Remember that.
[03:34:23.311 --> 03:34:28.913]  So, John in Delaware, continue with what you were saying about the great reset, the endgame, the final countdown.
[03:34:28.933 --> 03:34:29.273]  Go ahead.
[03:34:30.033 --> 03:34:32.114]  We just can't take it anymore, man.
[03:34:32.354 --> 03:34:33.695]  They spit in our faces.
[03:34:33.835 --> 03:34:34.695]  We cannot
[03:34:35.359 --> 03:34:36.900]  Have a short memory.
[03:34:37.460 --> 03:34:42.863]  They've killed us with all their conveniences, the Amazons, all this.
[03:34:43.323 --> 03:34:45.225]  We have to boycott everything.
[03:34:45.265 --> 03:34:54.930]  We have to get back to just being self-reliant, having some balls, and getting ready to fight if we have to fight.
[03:34:55.510 --> 03:34:59.592]  I'm not calling for any type of physical violence, but it could get to that point.
[03:35:00.553 --> 03:35:03.935]  If they keep going down this road, what are we going to do?
[03:35:04.790 --> 03:35:10.371]  What must they think of us to do what they did and we just accept that?
[03:35:11.832 --> 03:35:13.312]  I just can't go along with it.
[03:35:14.272 --> 03:35:18.033]  I can't go along with it.
[03:35:18.373 --> 03:35:22.734]  I mean, I've been ready to fly through the roof since November 3rd.
[03:35:23.274 --> 03:35:34.217]  And for them to blatantly do this to all of us and all these elderly people that I saw standing in line with walkers so that they could make their voice heard,
[03:35:34.801 --> 03:35:37.243]  And these people think they can just take that from us?
[03:35:37.724 --> 03:35:38.725]  Right out in the open!
[03:35:39.526 --> 03:35:42.108]  And we're just going to sit back and not do anything?
[03:35:42.128 --> 03:35:56.642]  Well brother, that's what I said, that's what I said over the weekend, is Klaus Schwab, Ted Turner, Bill Gates are all megalomaniacal eugenicists that say they want to depopulate us.
[03:35:57.756 --> 03:36:05.118]  We have histories, Klaus Schwab's involved in forced inoculation in Africa, of sterilizing and poisoning people with tainted medical systems.
[03:36:05.578 --> 03:36:06.578]  This is how they kill you.
[03:36:06.918 --> 03:36:09.639]  They don't do it with tanks and guns because folks organize and fight.
[03:36:10.099 --> 03:36:10.719]  Something like that.
[03:36:11.879 --> 03:36:16.480]  And so, yes, they are coming at us with illegal medical experimentation.
[03:36:17.221 --> 03:36:20.221]  Gates and Fauci have been caught running the Wuhan lab.
[03:36:20.721 --> 03:36:24.822]  It's all just brazen because they're going for broke.
[03:36:25.263 --> 03:36:26.143]  I appreciate your call.
[03:36:26.183 --> 03:36:27.163]  I mean, look at Klaus Schwab.
[03:36:28.837 --> 03:36:29.938]  He looks like a space alien.
[03:36:31.278 --> 03:36:32.739]  He looks like a Bond villain.
[03:36:33.460 --> 03:36:35.501]  But why do you think they make those Bond villains that way?
[03:36:35.541 --> 03:36:37.102]  Because those are based on real people.
[03:36:38.763 --> 03:36:45.387]  Klaus Schwab says we're going to forcibly merge you with machines, and you'll have to have a microchip to buy and sell in your brain.
[03:36:45.887 --> 03:36:46.828]  That's his new book!
[03:36:49.650 --> 03:36:56.654]  Remember, Joe Biden, like, 12 years ago, 13 years ago, before he was even
[03:36:57.912 --> 03:36:59.032]  When he was still a Senator.
[03:37:00.153 --> 03:37:06.855]  He said, to a Supreme Court Justice they're about to confirm, you will rule on microchips in people's brains, in their bodies.
[03:37:09.256 --> 03:37:10.477]  This has always been the plan.
[03:37:12.117 --> 03:37:12.677]  And it's here!
[03:37:14.378 --> 03:37:17.299]  And if you will acquiesce, that's your problem.
[03:37:17.899 --> 03:37:25.502]  In the new world, in the new world, it is not the big fish which eats the small fish, it's the fast fish which eats the slow fish.
[03:37:27.915 --> 03:37:29.055]  See, and he wants to eat you!
[03:37:30.696 --> 03:37:33.796]  We're going to help the poor by a global collapse!
[03:37:36.257 --> 03:37:36.437]  Wow.
[03:37:38.037 --> 03:37:39.858]  And the average liberal goes, well, there aren't so many people.
[03:37:39.898 --> 03:37:46.599]  They kind of get off in the reflective satanic fire, like they're warming their hands on, oh, I'll be part of it.
[03:37:46.679 --> 03:37:47.679]  No, you won't, idiot!
[03:37:50.220 --> 03:37:51.820]  I'm talking to leftists right now, not our audience.
[03:37:54.321 --> 03:37:54.961]  Oh my gosh.
[03:37:55.589 --> 03:37:57.890]  Let's go to Mike in Maryland.
[03:37:57.990 --> 03:37:58.730]  Mike, you're on the air.
[03:37:58.750 --> 03:37:59.070]  Go ahead.
[03:38:00.851 --> 03:38:01.391]  Hey, Alex.
[03:38:01.451 --> 03:38:05.093]  It's like when the Soviet Union came into check with Slovakia.
[03:38:05.473 --> 03:38:08.654]  The situation has been normalized, right?
[03:38:09.095 --> 03:38:11.055]  Well, so look, this is what I want to talk about.
[03:38:11.356 --> 03:38:17.318]  72% of stock is owned by a Jewish family from Iran tied into the Mossad.
[03:38:18.178 --> 03:38:20.699]  And there's a lot of backstory behind it.
[03:38:20.820 --> 03:38:21.760]  It's all been confirmed.
[03:38:22.561 --> 03:38:37.244]  He came to the United States when Iran had their revolution, and he went to an embassy in Copenhagen and actually gave up his house as collateral to be able to come here, so just totally circumnavigated U.S.
[03:38:37.644 --> 03:38:38.564]  immigration law.
[03:38:39.385 --> 03:38:50.227]  And this person has a giant effigy, a giant painting and sculptures of the murder of Haman, the Persian king and his nine sons, right in his house.
[03:38:50.911 --> 03:38:57.139]  So, this is the person who's entrenched into all the Dominion voting fraud machines, owns 72% of the stock.
[03:38:57.840 --> 03:39:00.884]  And, you know, look, I don't have anything against Jewish people.
[03:39:01.225 --> 03:39:02.166]  My wife is Jewish.
[03:39:02.346 --> 03:39:04.149]  I have Jewish children.
[03:39:05.050 --> 03:39:07.092]  But, you know, what is Amman?
[03:39:07.132 --> 03:39:08.512]  What is Jesus?
[03:39:08.572 --> 03:39:10.394]  What is the murder of the czar?
[03:39:10.774 --> 03:39:12.595]  And what does Dominion have in common?
[03:39:12.615 --> 03:39:14.296]  There's all occult Jews behind it.
[03:39:14.836 --> 03:39:18.499]  And people, you know, you have... Well, I know that Dominion's hooked into Venezuela.
[03:39:18.599 --> 03:39:21.520]  I know that even CNBC's done reports on it being a fraud.
[03:39:21.540 --> 03:39:23.001]  It's been decertified in a lot of states.
[03:39:23.422 --> 03:39:26.984]  But the media trying to act like we can just trust Dominion is just ridiculous.
[03:39:28.024 --> 03:39:39.050]  Yeah, and well, you're looking at almost every Twitter video that's coming out, you see these, the Antifa flag with the star of David on it, and then now the Holocaust Museum has a memorial for George Floyd.
[03:39:39.130 --> 03:39:48.655]  So, you know, European Americans need to wake up quickly and realize that there's a lot of groups out there trying to destroy them, silence them, and that's one of them.
[03:39:48.836 --> 03:39:54.239]  Look, Trump has done a lot for blacks, done a lot for Hispanics, done a lot across the board for all sorts of people, diabetics.
[03:39:54.279 --> 03:39:56.580]  My wife can now go to Walmart and get insulin.
[03:39:57.100 --> 03:40:17.432]  And before she wasn't able, he's done great things for all people, but the reason they're coming so hard after Trump is because he stood up for the Eddie, for the European Americans, and all sorts of Americans, but especially being able to say, look, all this blaming racism, saying, you know, that there's systemic racism in the United States.
[03:40:17.452 --> 03:40:19.954]  Sure, the left's definitely trying to put him off along racial lines.
[03:40:19.974 --> 03:40:20.794]  I appreciate your call, Mike.
[03:40:20.814 --> 03:40:22.596]  All right, let's go ahead and make another call here.
[03:40:22.656 --> 03:40:25.737]  Let's go to Joseph in Michigan.
[03:40:25.777 --> 03:40:26.418]  Go ahead, Joseph.
[03:40:27.478 --> 03:40:29.940]  Yeah, Alex, this is Joseph.
[03:40:30.200 --> 03:40:33.342]  I've called you before, probably about 10 years ago.
[03:40:34.583 --> 03:40:39.066]  And basically what I'm saying is we're locked down here in Michigan.
[03:40:39.707 --> 03:40:42.148]  Everybody's succumbing to the mask.
[03:40:42.268 --> 03:40:45.911]  They're all wearing their diaper, diaper masks and everything.
[03:40:46.451 --> 03:40:50.834]  But what it is, the main point I wanted to call you was, is I've been researching this.
[03:40:51.935 --> 03:40:55.818]  And the reason why they've got us in the mask is because
[03:40:56.608 --> 03:41:09.550]  AI recognizes your face, but they're doing it from the nose up so they can figure out, you know, all your different points and stuff in your eyes and your retinas and stuff like that.
[03:41:10.030 --> 03:41:12.351]  So the mask has nothing to do with the virus.
[03:41:13.911 --> 03:41:19.712]  What they did was the Chinese government developed an algorithm right now.
[03:41:20.492 --> 03:41:22.753]  And Alex, I mean it, I am not kidding you.
[03:41:23.373 --> 03:41:24.753]  It's a Chai Com takeover.
[03:41:25.370 --> 03:41:26.510]  They're taking over the world right now.
[03:41:26.550 --> 03:41:30.071]  Well, sir, I mean, I know that big tech merges with China and that's part of it.
[03:41:30.571 --> 03:41:36.492]  They even have mainline articles about how it's body scanning your walk is the test they're doing.
[03:41:36.533 --> 03:41:40.133]  But regardless, sir, it's all a symbol of subservience.
[03:41:40.233 --> 03:41:41.594]  It spreads viral pneumonia.
[03:41:41.894 --> 03:41:43.214]  It's meant to actually kill people.
[03:41:43.634 --> 03:41:44.734]  It lowers IQs.
[03:41:45.214 --> 03:41:46.415]  It kills individualism.
[03:41:46.495 --> 03:41:51.856]  And really, it's a cult symbol that you're a slave, like wearing a burka, if you're a woman under Islam.
[03:41:52.950 --> 03:41:58.017]  Hey, did you ever end up seeing the front of the frontline video of the age of AI?
[03:41:58.037 --> 03:41:59.900]  No, I didn't.
[03:42:00.842 --> 03:42:03.085]  Okay, you have to see that video, Alex.
[03:42:03.586 --> 03:42:09.214]  It's everything that you've been talking about on PBS and everything that you said.
[03:42:10.166 --> 03:42:12.427]  Everything, everything is covered there.
[03:42:12.447 --> 03:42:16.607]  They're talking about the nanotech and all that stuff with the vaccines.
[03:42:16.728 --> 03:42:17.948]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.
[03:42:18.128 --> 03:42:23.889]  Boris Johnson, all of them say, you will take shots of nanotech to make you behave that will reprogram your brain.
[03:42:24.329 --> 03:42:25.850]  I mean, it's all being announced.
[03:42:26.050 --> 03:42:34.191]  They're literally, these are behavioral modification vaccines with viruses that eat certain synapses in the brain that are connected to higher brainwaves.
[03:42:34.231 --> 03:42:36.032]  This is a cult lobotomy.
[03:42:36.852 --> 03:42:37.893]  It's a violent attack.
[03:42:38.574 --> 03:42:41.278]  And what would you do if aliens landed and were coming with deadly injections?
[03:42:41.338 --> 03:42:41.818]  You'd fight them.
[03:42:42.519 --> 03:42:43.821]  And that's where this is all going.
[03:42:43.841 --> 03:42:45.283]  First, they're going to hit the poor.
[03:42:45.964 --> 03:42:47.005]  Everybody go along with that.
[03:42:47.305 --> 03:42:48.707]  And it's just all mass conditioning.
[03:42:49.588 --> 03:42:50.309]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:50.710 --> 03:42:52.011]  Infowars.com.
[03:42:52.031 --> 03:42:52.892]  Tomorrow's news.
[03:42:53.233 --> 03:42:54.975]  Today, my message to President Trump.
[03:42:55.235 --> 03:42:55.676]  Straight ahead.
[03:43:00.776 --> 03:43:07.323]  There's a talented young lady named What's-Her-Face online that's getting millions of views, and she's engaging in thought crime.
[03:43:08.365 --> 03:43:21.359]  She's coming out and pointing out that when you virtue signal for mindless corporations that run death camps in communist China like Apple by wearing a little mask that gives you bacterial pneumonia, that you're really a fraud.
[03:43:22.160 --> 03:43:25.781]  And it's women and other humans like her that are going to turn the tide.
[03:43:26.541 --> 03:43:34.183]  If you agree to the face mask, you're going to agree to forced inoculations, contact tracers coming to your house, secret police, checkpoints.
[03:43:34.883 --> 03:43:37.164]  We already saw it in Australia and in the EU.
[03:43:37.404 --> 03:43:46.366]  Now in the US, they have checkpoints on the highways in New York where they grab you out of buses and take you to COVID centers for something less dangerous than a common cold.
[03:43:47.026 --> 03:43:52.172]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the UN martial law cover to take over society.
[03:43:53.073 --> 03:43:54.695]  And we're here on air exposing it.
[03:43:55.276 --> 03:43:56.598]  The dystopia is here.
[03:43:57.098 --> 03:43:59.161]  I wish this wasn't the case, but it is.
[03:43:59.661 --> 03:44:04.387]  And Governor Newsom and other scumbag, globalist pieces of trash like his.
[03:44:05.328 --> 03:44:06.489]  Oh, my apologies.
[03:44:29.130 --> 03:44:32.913]  I was wearing my mask because I just got back from a full day of being a good person.
[03:44:33.134 --> 03:44:37.337]  I love my mask because it's a simple yet effective way to display my righteousness.
[03:44:37.438 --> 03:44:42.002]  Am I concerned that two children in China dropped dead because they were forced to wear masks in gym class?
[03:44:42.082 --> 03:44:42.302]  Nope.
[03:44:42.502 --> 03:44:48.508]  Am I concerned that we're creating a generation of children who will be socially awkward and conditioned to fear their fellow man?
[03:44:48.648 --> 03:44:48.868]  No.
[03:44:49.168 --> 03:44:54.949]  Am I concerned that I'm contributing to an impending socialist technocracy that will enslave the global population?
[03:44:55.009 --> 03:44:56.289]  Not even a little bit!
[03:44:56.389 --> 03:45:04.511]  Am I concerned that my mask is symbolic of my compliance to the social conditioning that will eventually lead to the forced vaccination of every man, woman, and child on planet Earth?
[03:45:04.711 --> 03:45:05.711]  Not a chance!
[03:45:05.871 --> 03:45:07.751]  And why am I not concerned, you ask?
[03:45:07.871 --> 03:45:16.513]  I'm not concerned because I decided a long time ago that shallow and significant gestures are a much easier way to showcase my morality than actually being moral.
[03:45:16.613 --> 03:45:20.774]  Because in order to be a real good person, I gotta stand up to a real bad person.
[03:45:20.874 --> 03:45:23.315]  And I don't like standing up to or for anything.
[03:45:23.435 --> 03:45:29.777]  I've decided that it's much easier to trick my own mind into thinking compliance is a virtue instead of what compliance actually is.
[03:45:29.897 --> 03:45:30.477]  Cowardice!
[03:45:30.657 --> 03:45:37.139]  I prefer to float through life completely ignorant to the fact that every socialist takeover has always begun in the exact same way.
[03:45:37.199 --> 03:45:41.661]  With government overreach, public shaming, censorship, and a toilet paper shortage.
[03:45:41.761 --> 03:45:42.501]  Don't believe me?
[03:45:42.561 --> 03:45:45.002]  Google toilet paper shortage in communist Russia.
[03:45:45.162 --> 03:45:47.363]  Did you think you were having a unique experience?
[03:45:47.543 --> 03:45:54.767]  I prefer to pretend history never repeats itself so that I can stand by and turn a blind eye every time history repeats itself.
[03:45:54.967 --> 03:46:02.572]  I prefer to call anyone who speaks up, fights back, or stands their ground a lunatic or a conspiracy theorist so that I don't feel obligated to do my own research.
[03:46:02.692 --> 03:46:04.313]  Research takes away from me time.
[03:46:04.453 --> 03:46:13.958]  And lastly, I prefer to put on my mask and stand among a sea of masks so that I never have to be seen, be free, or reveal the deep dark shadows that lurk within me.
[03:46:14.378 --> 03:46:15.780]  What's-her-face gets it.
[03:46:16.761 --> 03:46:19.384]  This is all an exercise in enslavement.
[03:46:20.165 --> 03:46:32.200]  And AI censors think they can defeat you, but if you spread the word about Van Dodd video, and InfoWars.com, and NewsWars.com, and promote her as well, we will, with human power, human intelligence, HUMET, overpower them.
[03:46:33.573 --> 03:46:34.733]  Only you can get pissed off.
[03:46:35.234 --> 03:46:35.934]  Only you can do it.
[03:46:36.434 --> 03:46:38.535]  Spread the word about Bandai Video.
[03:46:38.955 --> 03:46:40.455]  Spread the word about m4wars.com.
[03:46:41.375 --> 03:46:48.678]  And at the same time, financially support us with amazing products that boost your immune system and more at m4wars.com.
[03:46:48.898 --> 03:46:52.239]  Look into X2, look into DNA Force, look into Ultra 12.
[03:46:52.639 --> 03:46:56.460]  Check them all out at m4wars.com and fund the second American Revolution.
[03:46:56.760 --> 03:46:58.101]  The globalists hope you don't.
[03:46:58.521 --> 03:46:59.281]  I hope you will.
[03:47:02.273 --> 03:47:06.358]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:06.899 --> 03:47:08.181]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:47:41.286 --> 03:47:42.487]  All right, welcome back.
[03:47:42.507 --> 03:47:43.727]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[03:47:44.647 --> 03:47:50.689]  If you go to Infowars.com, you'll see the headline for the live show today.
[03:47:52.049 --> 03:47:53.709]  It is emergency transmission.
[03:47:54.410 --> 03:47:58.891]  Trump can still win, but he must act now and he needs your help.
[03:48:00.831 --> 03:48:03.852]  So the best way to start here is just to explain that I have talked to
[03:48:05.805 --> 03:48:21.511]  Several of the highest level lawyers on the Trump team, most of the lawyers that Trump has sent out, have been asked not to do interviews, and have been asked not to give out any of their strategy, even though all their phones are tapped and the enemy knows their strategy.
[03:48:23.411 --> 03:48:30.374]  Trump has been told that if he makes a bunch of statements, that the courts are more apt to rule against him.
[03:48:31.718 --> 03:48:34.759]  And that's generally true in a non-political case.
[03:48:34.979 --> 03:48:43.101]  But this is totally political, and the Democrats are everywhere saying Joe Biden's the winner with an imaginary office of the president-elect.
[03:48:45.081 --> 03:48:48.582]  And now Twitter says, we don't care if the Supreme Court even rules that Trump's the president.
[03:48:48.902 --> 03:48:49.942]  We're going to say it's Joe Biden.
[03:48:50.142 --> 03:48:52.443]  So the Rubicon has been crossed here.
[03:48:54.143 --> 03:48:57.944]  Now, there was an internal debate in the last week before Tucker Carlson ever went with this.
[03:48:59.250 --> 03:49:06.237]  And they were saying, let's go with the signatures that they didn't validate in Georgia or Pennsylvania or Michigan.
[03:49:07.798 --> 03:49:17.428]  That that's the strongest case to get an audit of those because they'd already done some spot checks and up to 10% didn't even have signatures or were fake signatures clearly.
[03:49:21.007 --> 03:49:31.396]  And so that began to become the main push, not Dominion Software, not Bill Gates, not Venezuela, which I think is all very, very credibly fraudulent.
[03:49:31.977 --> 03:49:36.361]  And you've seen how the machines did add in all those votes later and how those scams work.
[03:49:36.381 --> 03:49:39.824]  But the real fraud you can prove is the balance with the signatures.
[03:49:40.184 --> 03:49:41.305]  That's where they've got the proof.
[03:49:43.167 --> 03:49:45.249]  We saw some good news on Friday with the Supreme Court.
[03:49:46.505 --> 03:49:51.127]  Appointed all conservative justices over the circuit courts in the five battleground states.
[03:49:51.227 --> 03:49:51.947]  That was a big deal.
[03:49:55.429 --> 03:50:08.454]  So, you have this massive brainwashing, confidence game, Emperor's New Clothes scam, where the mainstream corporate media just keeps saying, Joe Biden's the president, Joe Biden's the president, no evidence of fraud, no evidence of fraud.
[03:50:10.415 --> 03:50:14.017]  And Trump is there going through the court cases,
[03:50:15.171 --> 03:50:19.414]  Knowing that the lower courts are Democrats in those states, they're going to rule against him.
[03:50:19.814 --> 03:50:22.236]  That'll be declared as, oh look, Trump doesn't have a case.
[03:50:22.576 --> 03:50:24.658]  But they know full well he's got real cases.
[03:50:24.978 --> 03:50:35.365]  There was just a ruling an hour and a half ago in Pennsylvania by the Third Circuit expediting Trump's appeal of the Obama judge up to the full circuit court and then the Supreme Court.
[03:50:37.467 --> 03:50:40.409]  That happened because they know the Supreme Court justice is over it.
[03:50:41.290 --> 03:50:42.891]  If the judge is slow play it,
[03:50:44.901 --> 03:50:49.503]  They are going to accelerate it up the Supreme Court.
[03:50:49.523 --> 03:50:51.044]  That will antagonize the Supreme Court.
[03:50:51.404 --> 03:50:59.187]  So the Democrat judges are quickly handing it up because they understand that the Supremes are sitting right above them watching what they're doing.
[03:50:59.247 --> 03:51:01.028]  So Trump has a path.
[03:51:03.203 --> 03:51:04.564]  But this is mainly political.
[03:51:04.604 --> 03:51:07.426]  It doesn't matter that he got 10 million more votes than last time.
[03:51:07.566 --> 03:51:09.747]  It doesn't matter he got more votes than any Republican in history.
[03:51:10.007 --> 03:51:16.671]  It doesn't matter if he did double and triple digit better with Hispanics and Blacks in all the polls than magically they say white men voted against him.
[03:51:17.992 --> 03:51:21.314]  It doesn't matter if when the polls closed all the votes basically came in against him.
[03:51:22.975 --> 03:51:27.538]  He has to get out there in resolute desk announcements
[03:51:29.301 --> 03:51:43.784]  And he has to walk through all the evidence daily, the American people, and counter why he's doing this, and explain to people what Joe Biden's gonna do when he gets in, and how the stock market's already going down.
[03:51:45.804 --> 03:51:53.845]  Instead, Trump is listening to his lawyers and letting it be a purely legal battle, but their lawyers, they don't understand that, with the exception of maybe Giuliani.
[03:51:55.526 --> 03:51:57.166]  Some are gonna say, well,
[03:51:59.429 --> 03:52:03.191]  Are they parlaying?
[03:52:03.291 --> 03:52:10.634]  Is Trump making deals now because he knows he's been cheated for the system to not come after him if he basically gives up?
[03:52:11.614 --> 03:52:12.455]  I don't think that's the case.
[03:52:12.515 --> 03:52:13.695]  Trump isn't that type of person.
[03:52:14.075 --> 03:52:15.336]  He's an island unto himself.
[03:52:16.996 --> 03:52:19.838]  He also knows none of their agreements are valid.
[03:52:20.098 --> 03:52:21.138]  They betray everybody.
[03:52:21.378 --> 03:52:22.399]  Trump knows that.
[03:52:22.439 --> 03:52:23.839]  Trump's not making behind-the-scenes deals.
[03:52:24.400 --> 03:52:27.481]  He really believes that if you suddenly don't see him out there,
[03:52:28.638 --> 03:52:36.869]  And that as he mounts the evidence that at a certain point he's ready to come out when he starts having Supreme Court victories.
[03:52:37.369 --> 03:52:39.172]  But the globalists are never going to let it get to that.
[03:52:39.432 --> 03:52:43.477]  They're going to call each lower court defeat proof that it's a fraud.
[03:52:43.497 --> 03:52:46.281]  They're going to call the state certifications proof that it's a fraud.
[03:52:47.773 --> 03:52:57.635]  And they're going to run the clock out and create a constitutional crisis where the Supreme Court has incredible pressure on it because the public starts to believe that really Trump lost and gives up.
[03:52:58.015 --> 03:53:05.717]  And that's why having all the neocons come out against Trump and now even having the Republican leader in the House, McCarthy, not come out and defend Trump.
[03:53:06.317 --> 03:53:07.658]  Yeah, Pompeo's defending him.
[03:53:08.038 --> 03:53:09.238]  Yeah, Giuliani's defending him.
[03:53:11.377 --> 03:53:21.287]  The rats are leaving the sinking ship all trying to parlay themselves a deal in a future administration and they're being promised money to do it.
[03:53:23.229 --> 03:53:29.094]  So Trump has no choice but to get all the facts together.
[03:53:31.557 --> 03:53:33.599]  I would suggest he be advised by somebody like
[03:53:34.946 --> 03:53:37.847]  Jim Hoft, who's doing Herculean work.
[03:53:37.887 --> 03:53:39.447]  I mean, do you think we're working?
[03:53:39.467 --> 03:53:41.747]  I've never seen the stuff going on at Gateway Pundit.
[03:53:41.767 --> 03:53:42.427]  It's over the top.
[03:53:42.448 --> 03:53:44.348]  I mean, this is 20 hours a day of work.
[03:53:44.388 --> 03:53:45.248]  This is savage.
[03:53:46.248 --> 03:53:55.130]  I mean, they published dozens of hours of video with all of these eyewitnesses of total fraud in Michigan and other states.
[03:53:55.230 --> 03:53:57.571]  I mean, and these are all real people on record.
[03:53:58.491 --> 03:53:59.751]  Some of them prominent that saw this.
[03:54:02.054 --> 03:54:12.763]  And Trump just has to get in there at the Resolute Desk and just counter all of this because he's waiting to let the courts do it and sucker punch the left.
[03:54:12.963 --> 03:54:17.847]  And, you know, they've got polls of 70% of Republicans think it was stolen, 87% think it's stolen.
[03:54:21.596 --> 03:54:26.738]  We can debate all day how Trump let the censorship happen and got undercut and undermined and that doesn't matter.
[03:54:27.138 --> 03:54:28.979]  Trump was going to bat for America.
[03:54:29.279 --> 03:54:30.780]  Trump was standing up for our sovereignty.
[03:54:31.100 --> 03:54:31.880]  He was surrounded.
[03:54:32.120 --> 03:54:33.101]  He did an incredible job.
[03:54:33.141 --> 03:54:34.501]  So number one, pray for President Trump.
[03:54:35.062 --> 03:54:37.823]  President Trump should get on his knees and pray to God for divine intervention.
[03:54:39.744 --> 03:54:46.187]  And Trump should also come out and just absolutely play clips of Hillary saying, we'll contest this all the way.
[03:54:46.207 --> 03:54:49.628]  We'll say he's not the president, even if he's inaugurated.
[03:54:50.149 --> 03:54:56.591]  And Biden saying, you know, I promise to wait till it's independently certified by Congress and by the courts.
[03:54:58.232 --> 03:54:59.273]  But that's all dead.
[03:55:00.113 --> 03:55:09.157]  And because Trump is dead on those points, he has his surrogates, Lou Dobbs, Sean Hannity,
[03:55:11.311 --> 03:55:17.114]  Rush Limbaugh out there telling the truth, but it doesn't matter because that's only talking to their audience.
[03:55:17.134 --> 03:55:18.355]  They've been blocked everywhere else.
[03:55:19.015 --> 03:55:21.497]  Only the President of the United States.
[03:55:25.279 --> 03:55:32.783]  Only the President of the United States at the Resolute Desk, for whatever reason he never gives Oval Office addresses, very rarely.
[03:55:33.143 --> 03:55:34.504]  Reagan gave 23 of them.
[03:55:34.884 --> 03:55:36.045]  I think Trump's given like three.
[03:55:36.825 --> 03:55:39.447]  Trump should be at the Resolute Desk every night.
[03:55:41.391 --> 03:55:57.648]  With a computer screen, showing you the clips, showing you the fraud, showing you the videos, showing you the eyewitnesses, showing the poll watchers being thrown out, showing the thousands of votes per county in Georgia being found for Trump, and Biden's lead brought down to almost zero.
[03:55:58.369 --> 03:55:59.410]  I mean, this is crazy!
[03:55:59.711 --> 03:56:00.672]  Showing the governor!
[03:56:00.812 --> 03:56:01.593]  They didn't betray him!
[03:56:01.753 --> 03:56:03.315]  The media said, oh, Trump!
[03:56:04.557 --> 03:56:06.978]  The governor of Georgia, you know, says Trump has 11.
[03:56:07.018 --> 03:56:09.338]  The governor said major evidence of fraud.
[03:56:09.998 --> 03:56:11.098]  Razor-thin margin.
[03:56:11.178 --> 03:56:12.099]  Found voting machines.
[03:56:12.159 --> 03:56:13.299]  Found all the votes for Trump.
[03:56:13.519 --> 03:56:14.739]  Didn't find votes for Biden.
[03:56:14.999 --> 03:56:18.680]  We need a real audit, not a computer audit, rerunning the same thing.
[03:56:19.900 --> 03:56:20.880]  Nowhere is that out there.
[03:56:21.300 --> 03:56:23.941]  The president should have been talking about that.
[03:56:25.681 --> 03:56:26.842]  This is a bad strategy.
[03:56:29.082 --> 03:56:33.503]  And Trump needs to start speaking out now and aggressively.
[03:56:34.755 --> 03:56:36.336]  Because this is more than just Trump being cheated.
[03:56:36.376 --> 03:56:44.583]  It's the American people, and it's a group of globalists that say permanent lockdown and martial law coming in, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:56:44.623 --> 03:56:46.445]  They mean to break this country down the middle.
[03:56:46.465 --> 03:56:47.625]  They mean to have war with us.
[03:56:47.666 --> 03:56:49.387]  They mean to push us and never stop.
[03:56:49.827 --> 03:56:50.568]  I'm going to go to break.
[03:56:51.449 --> 03:56:52.089]  I'm going to come back.
[03:56:52.109 --> 03:56:53.831]  I'm going to go back to your calls.
[03:56:54.111 --> 03:56:54.771]  A lot of other news.
[03:56:54.791 --> 03:56:57.013]  I'll play some clips of Trump saying he may not be here long.
[03:56:57.614 --> 03:56:58.995]  Three months ago, how important that is.
[03:56:59.035 --> 03:56:59.595]  It's all coming up.
[03:56:59.655 --> 03:57:00.636]  Hour number three straight ahead.
[03:57:01.056 --> 03:57:01.537]  Please, though.
[03:57:02.657 --> 03:57:03.397]  Keep us on air.
[03:57:04.198 --> 03:57:09.379]  We're here if you finance us, but we need money to defeat the globalists.
[03:57:09.459 --> 03:57:12.901]  We need a lot of money to fight the globalists and all the DNC lawsuits, the rest of it.
[03:57:12.941 --> 03:57:14.641]  We're beating it all, and they're pissed.
[03:57:15.081 --> 03:57:17.622]  But we need your prayer, we need your word of mouth, we need your financial support.
[03:57:18.023 --> 03:57:20.764]  I've said for a week the sale's gonna end, I've been too busy to come up with a new sale.
[03:57:21.824 --> 03:57:25.765]  The Stop Lockdown 2 Save the Republic sale's gotta end today, it will end today.
