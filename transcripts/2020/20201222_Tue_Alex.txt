[00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:21.728]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this Tuesday, December 22nd.
[00:00:21.728 --> 00:00:31.254]  The year is 2020 as we are hurtling to the year 2021.
[00:00:31.254 --> 00:00:41.841]  And finally, the conclusion of the 2020 presidential election, which saw a landslide victory for President Donald J. Trump.
[00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:54.910]  Only to be stolen in the dead of night by the kleptocrat, globalist, democrat, chi-com, uh, congruency of criminal activity.
[00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.251]  And we've got all of that news coming up.
[00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:00.092]  We've got breaking COVID news.
[00:01:00.092 --> 00:01:06.775]  I'm going to lay out this stimulus bill that I hope will be vetoed by the president.
[00:01:07.523 --> 00:01:10.705]  Because this is ridiculous.
[00:01:10.705 --> 00:01:13.547]  You want to talk about a slap in the face?
[00:01:13.547 --> 00:01:22.852]  This is the slap in the face, but with a, like, it's like they just farted in their hand and then, like, wafted it into your mouth.
[00:01:22.852 --> 00:01:27.034]  I mean, I'm sorry to be gross, that's how offensive this stimulus bill is.
[00:01:27.034 --> 00:01:32.738]  So we've got the details of that coming up as well.
[00:01:32.738 --> 00:01:34.939]  And of course, with 28 days left to stop
[00:01:37.773 --> 00:01:50.162]  At the end of the republic, as we know it, if Joe Biden gets into the White House, we're going to have attorney Robert Barnes joining me to discuss this, Nick Fuentes joining me to discuss this.
[00:01:50.162 --> 00:01:56.847]  But first, before I do that, you know, we are living in a sci-fi dystopian movie.
[00:01:56.847 --> 00:01:59.810]  Sometimes you wonder if you're going to wake up from this nightmare.
[00:02:00.831 --> 00:02:01.812]  But no, we are here.
[00:02:01.812 --> 00:02:02.492]  We are in it.
[00:02:02.492 --> 00:02:09.037]  And so, let's go into suspended reality and just try to enjoy this for whatever it's worth.
[00:02:09.037 --> 00:02:12.399]  Two pricks getting the prick.
[00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:15.381]  And of course, that's Joe Biden and Anthony Fauci.
[00:02:15.381 --> 00:02:19.484]  Guys, if you just want to roll the b-roll, I don't care whether you roll Joe or Fauci, whoever it is.
[00:02:19.484 --> 00:02:22.766]  And it's just hilarious to watch this.
[00:02:24.232 --> 00:02:27.753]  Complete big pharma stooges.
[00:02:27.753 --> 00:02:29.113]  Complete sellouts.
[00:02:29.113 --> 00:02:30.193]  Complete frauds.
[00:02:30.193 --> 00:02:33.794]  Complete phonies telling us nothing to worry about.
[00:02:33.794 --> 00:02:35.494]  Get the vaccine.
[00:02:35.494 --> 00:02:36.715]  You'll be fine.
[00:02:36.715 --> 00:02:40.075]  Well, why are you telling me that?
[00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:44.956]  Why are you trying to convince me so much that this vaccine will be fine?
[00:02:44.956 --> 00:02:48.897]  And I'm noticing another thing now that I'm watching this.
[00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:53.318]  Each vaccine that I've seen administered here
[00:02:55.143 --> 00:03:00.885]  On camera, whether it's Biden or Fauci or some other numbnuts, it always is a different amount.
[00:03:00.885 --> 00:03:05.787]  Biden just had a very small amount there, so that's a little strange to me.
[00:03:05.787 --> 00:03:08.648]  I guess what I should say is, I'm not buying it.
[00:03:08.648 --> 00:03:11.370]  I'm not buying Joe Biden actually got a COVID vaccine.
[00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:12.950]  Guys, roll Fauci getting it too.
[00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.751]  I'm not buying that Fauci actually got a COVID vaccine.
[00:03:15.751 --> 00:03:19.813]  They probably got something else like a B12 shot.
[00:03:19.813 --> 00:03:21.914]  Because they're not getting an RNA shot, folks.
[00:03:24.372 --> 00:03:34.914]  I saw an actual, I guess it was a biologist or whatever, break down what the RNA shot does.
[00:03:34.914 --> 00:03:40.475]  And it's everything that we told you.
[00:03:40.475 --> 00:03:45.296]  Now, they know this is an experimental vax.
[00:03:45.296 --> 00:03:47.476]  Look at that chicken neck.
[00:03:47.476 --> 00:03:49.316]  Look at that sleeve.
[00:03:49.316 --> 00:03:51.717]  Look at that string hanging out of his arm.
[00:03:51.717 --> 00:03:52.457]  Oh, that is his arm.
[00:03:54.906 --> 00:03:58.947]  I mean, let's see what Fauci's little, uh, little shot here looks like.
[00:03:58.947 --> 00:03:59.987]  Maybe he doesn't even get it.
[00:03:59.987 --> 00:04:03.067]  I haven't seen this one.
[00:04:03.067 --> 00:04:05.808]  Oh, ah, the vaccine is so great.
[00:04:05.808 --> 00:04:09.469]  Let me just convince you how great it is.
[00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:10.269]  Let's see here.
[00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.629]  Oh, you can't really see how much is in that one.
[00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:17.010]  Boy, that one stayed in there a while, didn't it?
[00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:18.850]  Oh, yeah.
[00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.251]  Yeah, Fauci.
[00:04:21.251 --> 00:04:23.011]  Get that vaccine.
[00:04:23.991 --> 00:04:27.534]  Get that RNA vaccine, Patty.
[00:04:27.534 --> 00:04:31.618]  Bring in your medical tyranny.
[00:04:31.618 --> 00:04:36.082]  So, no, you did not just get the RNA vaccine that you want to give us.
[00:04:36.082 --> 00:04:38.244]  And he stands up and runs away.
[00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:40.306]  I'm not buying it.
[00:04:40.306 --> 00:04:41.407]  No, maybe they did, maybe they didn't.
[00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:52.925]  But folks, they're now coming out and telling you this is going to be a mandatory vaccine, even though Fauci says the lockdowns have to continue and there's already a new strain here.
[00:04:52.925 --> 00:04:56.190]  So the COVID vaccine is already irrelevant, folks.
[00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:57.092]  It's already irrelevant.
[00:04:58.442 --> 00:05:01.704]  The globalists have always been at war with the family and small businesses.
[00:05:01.704 --> 00:05:02.785]  They want control.
[00:05:02.785 --> 00:05:04.446]  They want domesticated slaves.
[00:05:04.446 --> 00:05:07.868]  That's the process that is taking place right now.
[00:05:07.868 --> 00:05:19.616]  And when you shop at the big box stores, and when you shop with Amazon, remember that they are creating monopolies, and they are the globalists that are pushing the lockdowns, gun control, abortion, world government, all of it.
[00:05:19.616 --> 00:05:21.637]  And if you want to do that, go ahead and shop there.
[00:05:21.637 --> 00:05:27.862]  But if you'll shop at InfoWars, where we have thousands of products, made right here in America, with our warehouses and our crew,
[00:05:28.602 --> 00:05:30.824]  It's incredible and it changes the whole world.
[00:05:30.824 --> 00:05:36.388]  So do your shopping if you want to fund the InfoWar and if you want to stop the globalists at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:05:36.388 --> 00:05:38.949]  And tell others to do their shopping at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:40.470]  We have amazing products.
[00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:44.673]  We can get everything delivered to you by Christmas if you order by the 18th.
[00:05:44.673 --> 00:05:46.254]  So again, I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:05:46.254 --> 00:05:49.797]  I want to thank you for thinking through what you do and where you spend your money.
[00:05:49.797 --> 00:05:52.419]  And do your shopping and get great products at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:06:08.413 --> 00:06:14.855]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones Show, and there's Anthony Fauci getting a shot.
[00:06:14.855 --> 00:06:15.735]  Isn't that nice?
[00:06:15.735 --> 00:06:21.897]  Oh, thank you, Fauci!
[00:06:21.897 --> 00:06:22.958]  Yes!
[00:06:22.958 --> 00:06:24.978]  Oh, Dr. Fauci, we love you!
[00:06:24.978 --> 00:06:28.139]  You're a hero!
[00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.101]  There's Fauci.
[00:06:32.101 --> 00:06:35.842]  A guy who hasn't done any actual medical practice maybe in his whole life.
[00:06:36.687 --> 00:06:38.689]  But he'll tell you to get the vaccine.
[00:06:38.689 --> 00:06:40.691]  Oh, he's lined up too.
[00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:42.432]  And I love how they have these nurses out here.
[00:06:42.432 --> 00:06:46.056]  Everybody's wearing a mask and they have the face shields.
[00:06:46.056 --> 00:06:47.397]  It's all a big joke.
[00:06:47.397 --> 00:06:49.499]  It's all a big ruse.
[00:06:49.499 --> 00:06:50.940]  And we're just along for the ride.
[00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:53.062]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:53.062 --> 00:06:54.764]  It is Tuesday, December 22nd.
[00:06:54.764 --> 00:06:55.364]  The year is 2020.
[00:06:55.364 --> 00:06:58.407]  Owen Schroer sitting in for Alex today.
[00:06:58.407 --> 00:07:00.189]  Great guests coming up.
[00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:01.870]  Robert Barnes in 30 minutes.
[00:07:02.831 --> 00:07:06.454]  Nick Fuentes in an hour and 30 minutes.
[00:07:06.454 --> 00:07:08.716]  Paul Joseph Watson hosting the fourth hour.
[00:07:08.716 --> 00:07:11.598]  I'm going to squeeze in phone calls today as well.
[00:07:11.598 --> 00:07:21.366]  If I can't get to phone calls today on this broadcast, because I have a ton of news, I will dedicate the War Room, which I'll also be hosting today, to your phone calls.
[00:07:21.366 --> 00:07:25.930]  So we will be taking your phone calls whether it's in the next three hours or from 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:28.552]  when I'm hosting the War Room.
[00:07:28.552 --> 00:07:31.114]  What we're going to get to today, the
[00:07:32.523 --> 00:07:37.088]  I mean, how do you even do proper analysis of this?
[00:07:37.088 --> 00:07:54.645]  You have a fake pandemic and now you have an experimental vaccine where the vaccine manufacturers are immune from, no pun intended, immune from any legal liability, any lawsuits.
[00:07:54.645 --> 00:07:54.945]  How?
[00:07:56.121 --> 00:07:58.281]  Could we possibly allow that?
[00:07:58.281 --> 00:08:16.325]  Well, if that isn't absurd enough, which there's actually more absurdities to go along with that, now vaccine IDs, and also the fact that they're claiming there's new strains of COVID, so the vaccine that they just had warp speed to give you is already irrelevant.
[00:08:16.325 --> 00:08:17.425]  It already is irrelevant.
[00:08:17.425 --> 00:08:22.206]  We've got new strains of COVID, so the vaccine doesn't even do anything.
[00:08:22.206 --> 00:08:22.846]  Except it's a
[00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:29.493]  Experimental vaccine with the messenger RNA to go rewrite your human genome.
[00:08:29.493 --> 00:08:31.274]  Very loving.
[00:08:31.274 --> 00:08:32.455]  Very loving.
[00:08:32.455 --> 00:08:39.840]  And the scientists who see people talking about this, they go break it down and they're like, yeah, this is the new RNA vaccine.
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.960]  It's new nanotech.
[00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:41.981]  It's new biotech.
[00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:43.242]  It goes and rewrites your thing.
[00:08:43.242 --> 00:08:43.862]  It's cool.
[00:08:43.862 --> 00:08:44.843]  It's trendy.
[00:08:44.843 --> 00:08:45.623]  Sweet.
[00:08:45.623 --> 00:08:50.646]  So is a sledgehammer to your Johnson.
[00:08:50.646 --> 00:08:52.968]  It rewrites your reproductive system.
[00:08:54.076 --> 00:08:58.297]  Take a sledgehammer to your wee-wee, and you'll have a new reproductive system.
[00:08:58.297 --> 00:08:59.757]  And that's basically what they're saying.
[00:08:59.757 --> 00:09:04.078]  Oh, you get the messenger RNA, and it rewrites your human genome!
[00:09:04.078 --> 00:09:09.219]  Isn't it great?
[00:09:09.219 --> 00:09:20.421]  And the next thing you know, Gallagher is gonna step up and take a sledgehammer to your male member.
[00:09:20.421 --> 00:09:21.742]  But it's rewriting you.
[00:09:21.742 --> 00:09:23.102]  It's a good thing.
[00:09:23.102 --> 00:09:23.682]  You're welcome.
[00:09:25.162 --> 00:09:29.203]  You know, you just pass out, die, get Bell's Palsy.
[00:09:29.203 --> 00:09:30.003]  Oh!
[00:09:30.003 --> 00:09:33.403]  Can I sue a vaccine manufacturer?
[00:09:33.403 --> 00:09:35.284]  No!
[00:09:35.284 --> 00:09:38.564]  No, you just have to shut up and die.
[00:09:38.564 --> 00:09:40.325]  You're welcome.
[00:09:40.325 --> 00:09:45.026]  Yeah, of course Elmo wants to sell you the vaccine.
[00:09:45.026 --> 00:09:46.386]  Because it's just so trendy.
[00:09:46.386 --> 00:09:52.087]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[00:09:52.087 --> 00:09:53.007]  The good news is...
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:59.143]  The globalists, the corrupt globalists, have completely revealed themselves.
[00:09:59.143 --> 00:10:01.285]  Their agenda has been completely revealed.
[00:10:01.285 --> 00:10:04.448]  And now it's just a matter of are they going to get away with it?
[00:10:04.448 --> 00:10:10.673]  Whether it's the election theft or this experimental RNA vaccine that doesn't even stop COVID.
[00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:12.811]  Think about that.
[00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:16.633]  They're claiming you have to get two or three shots because this thing may not even stop COVID.
[00:10:16.633 --> 00:10:21.076]  And they tell you, yeah, you're gonna get the vaccine and you're probably gonna go numb for a little bit.
[00:10:21.076 --> 00:10:23.418]  You may faint or pass out.
[00:10:23.418 --> 00:10:26.280]  You may experience some death or death-like symptoms.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.701]  But it's okay.
[00:10:27.701 --> 00:10:31.063]  You're doing it for the greater good.
[00:10:31.063 --> 00:10:37.908]  Which, of course, is the entire notion behind communism.
[00:10:37.908 --> 00:10:41.631]  As if that's not offensive enough, they're going to be mandating this
[00:10:43.703 --> 00:10:45.824]  Starting next year.
[00:10:45.824 --> 00:10:48.846]  And so they're announcing that.
[00:10:48.846 --> 00:10:51.929]  Doesn't matter that the vaccine is already relevant.
[00:10:51.929 --> 00:11:01.715]  And then you have perhaps the greatest affront to your existence as an American citizen.
[00:11:01.715 --> 00:11:09.060]  The stimulus bill that I'm hoping the president will veto.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.862]  I do believe he still has the ability to veto this.
[00:11:11.862 --> 00:11:13.063]  This is out of control, folks.
[00:11:15.137 --> 00:11:24.323]  It's nothing new, but again, it's just getting away with murder right in front of your face.
[00:11:24.323 --> 00:11:26.664]  So we'll be looking at that.
[00:11:26.664 --> 00:11:42.674]  We'll be looking at President Trump's potential path to victory coming up in the next 28 days with Bob Barnes, as well as some developing news on that.
[00:11:42.674 --> 00:11:44.055]  So we're going to break all of this down.
[00:11:45.083 --> 00:11:52.169]  In the next three hours, or I will be, before Paul Joseph Watson hosts the fourth hour, and then I'll be back hosting the War Room.
[00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:58.054]  If we don't get the calls during the Alex Jones Show, we will dedicate that entire broadcast to your calls.
[00:11:58.054 --> 00:12:06.060]  Before I do that, though... You know, 2020 has been an interesting year.
[00:12:06.060 --> 00:12:10.784]  And, at the end of every year, you have to do your financials.
[00:12:10.784 --> 00:12:11.244]  And, um...
[00:12:12.145 --> 00:12:20.612]  Basically, you've seen what we've been able to do in 2020, and we'd like to have the same capacity and the same mobility.
[00:12:24.767 --> 00:12:28.289]  In 2021 as we did in 2020.
[00:12:28.289 --> 00:12:33.332]  Obviously things are difficult around here when you have to build your own infrastructure.
[00:12:33.332 --> 00:12:35.574]  That is not cheap.
[00:12:35.574 --> 00:12:45.360]  A lot of people don't fully understand or quite frankly respect how much money it takes just to get this place running every day.
[00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:54.737]  And you built this ship and you fuel this ship by shopping at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:12:54.737 --> 00:12:59.061]  InfoWars wants to be here through 2021 and beyond.
[00:12:59.061 --> 00:13:03.645]  Hell, we'd like to be here for infinity, but that takes all of us.
[00:13:03.645 --> 00:13:07.589]  The good news is we've got new specials right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:13:07.589 --> 00:13:09.571]  The New Year's Resolution Energize Pack.
[00:13:10.171 --> 00:13:19.238]  Featuring Vitamin B12, Super Mel Vitality, Turbo Force, the New Year's Revitalize Pack, the New Year's Revitalize and Energize Pack.
[00:13:19.238 --> 00:13:21.840]  It's all there on the screen right there.
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:34.249]  But, people are really excited, and rightfully so, that we have Vitamin D supplement, Winter Sun Plus, back in stock.
[00:13:36.758 --> 00:13:46.841]  We've been selling you Winter Sun Vitamin D for a long time at InfoWarsStore.com because this is well before COVID.
[00:13:46.841 --> 00:13:47.642]  This was years ago.
[00:13:47.642 --> 00:13:51.023]  We knew how important Vitamin D was, specifically during the winter.
[00:13:51.023 --> 00:13:52.964]  That's why it's called Winter Sun Plus.
[00:13:52.964 --> 00:13:54.964]  You're not getting as much Vitamin D in the winter.
[00:13:54.964 --> 00:13:59.586]  That's why people are more susceptible to a flu or any sort of illness.
[00:14:00.691 --> 00:14:00.791]  Yeah.
[00:14:20.006 --> 00:14:33.972]  As soon as people realized how important vitamin D was, and then they made the connection, whether they were actually afraid of COVID or they were just hearing this in the background, about how 90% or I think it's 80% of the COVID deaths, they're deficient in vitamin D.
[00:14:35.356 --> 00:14:42.219]  And then after eight months of denying vitamin D help, Fauci actually came out and said, no, you do need vitamin D, that scoundrel.
[00:14:42.219 --> 00:14:43.439]  Well, we knew that all along.
[00:14:43.439 --> 00:14:45.640]  That's why we sold Wintersun Plus.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.121]  Now it was sold out because we had a run of it.
[00:14:48.121 --> 00:14:50.342]  It is back in stock.
[00:14:50.342 --> 00:14:57.905]  And let me tell you, this is a good thing, but it is selling out fast for good reason.
[00:14:57.905 --> 00:15:01.527]  So it's a good thing because we're funding the broadcast, but we have it 50% off.
[00:15:01.527 --> 00:15:04.848]  So we have to sell every single one of these really to make any money.
[00:15:06.485 --> 00:15:08.886]  I mean, we could sell this at full price, folks.
[00:15:08.886 --> 00:15:12.168]  I mean, at the rate it's selling, most people would say, don't put 50% off on that.
[00:15:12.168 --> 00:15:12.809]  That's ridiculous.
[00:15:12.809 --> 00:15:15.590]  You could sell this, in fact, probably double the price.
[00:15:15.590 --> 00:15:16.511]  We don't do that.
[00:15:16.511 --> 00:15:27.077]  We cut the price in half because we want you to have the supplement, and our formula is sell as much as possible, even if it's at small margins, to fund ourselves.
[00:15:27.077 --> 00:15:30.059]  So sell as much product, as much as possible, at the lowest price.
[00:15:30.936 --> 00:15:32.679]  The best products.
[00:15:32.679 --> 00:15:34.221]  And that's how we fund ourselves.
[00:15:34.221 --> 00:15:36.224]  Wintersun Plus is the perfect example.
[00:15:36.224 --> 00:15:37.626]  So get your Wintersun Plus.
[00:15:37.626 --> 00:15:41.351]  Also, this is just because I saw this before we came in today.
[00:15:42.657 --> 00:15:43.858]  Uh, just to see what's going on.
[00:15:43.858 --> 00:15:49.204]  Not only is Wintersun Plus selling out fast, DNA Force Plus is also selling out fast.
[00:15:49.204 --> 00:15:50.585]  It's also 50% off.
[00:15:50.585 --> 00:15:52.287]  Now, I only got 6 seconds.
[00:15:52.287 --> 00:15:55.650]  I can't tell you about all the benefits of DNA Force Plus, but that is the real deal.
[00:15:55.650 --> 00:15:57.812]  That is an elite supplement at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:15:57.812 --> 00:16:01.076]  Globalists are taking control of the entire human genome.
[00:16:01.696 --> 00:16:04.257]  They are forcing mutations.
[00:16:04.257 --> 00:16:07.858]  This is forced evolution, or de-evolution.
[00:16:07.858 --> 00:16:16.402]  When you look at all the major research, all the major programs they're carrying out, they are not to produce people that are smarter, or folks that live longer, or are more moral.
[00:16:16.402 --> 00:16:16.802]  No.
[00:16:16.802 --> 00:16:19.563]  It's turning humanity into a commodity.
[00:16:19.563 --> 00:16:27.106]  Now we see some propaganda, like communist China bragging, Hey, we've done mRNA vaccines that make our soldiers supermen!
[00:16:27.106 --> 00:16:30.487]  That's a way to make it sexy that, Hey, we're experimenting on our troops!
[00:16:31.127 --> 00:16:37.492]  Well, the same thing's been happening to our troops, and thousands and thousands have died each time they try a new experimental vaccine.
[00:16:37.492 --> 00:16:42.076]  And I'm talking to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state of Texas Health Department.
[00:16:42.076 --> 00:16:45.659]  They say, Alex, we know it hurts a lot of people, but it's for a greater good.
[00:16:45.659 --> 00:16:46.640]  But that's not even true.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.223]  And it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, federal and state law.
[00:16:51.223 --> 00:16:56.588]  This is violence being carried out against us by military, and we have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[00:16:57.799 --> 00:17:05.126]  The year 2021 is almost here, and so we're launching our New Year's specials right now.
[00:17:05.126 --> 00:17:06.587]  We've got two different big sales.
[00:17:06.587 --> 00:17:13.834]  We've got Super Metal Vitality, Turbo Force, and Ultra 12, part of the New Year's Resolution Energize Pack, 40% off.
[00:17:13.834 --> 00:17:19.019]  We've got Bodies, Vazzo Beats, and Knockout, part of the New Year's Resolution Revitalize Pack, at 40% off.
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:27.101]  But if you get both of these packs together, they are 60% off with free shipping and double Patriot points.
[00:17:27.101 --> 00:17:28.382]  The best deal ever.
[00:17:28.382 --> 00:17:33.803]  I want to thank you all for your support and encourage you to go to InfoWarsTore.com today and take advantage of this.
[00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:36.563]  And you can't lose because it funds the InfoWar.
[00:17:36.563 --> 00:17:43.485]  Again, get the great products at InfoWarsTore.com and fund the Second American Revolution worldwide at a time that is more critical than ever.
[00:17:44.005 --> 00:17:50.509]  Again, the year 2021 is here, and I am committed to you to fight against the globalists harder than ever.
[00:17:50.509 --> 00:17:53.130]  So thank you so much for keeping InfoWars in the fight.
[00:17:53.130 --> 00:18:01.355]  Without your support, we couldn't do any of it.
[00:18:01.355 --> 00:18:04.017]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:10.363 --> 00:18:16.946]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:18:16.946 --> 00:18:19.887]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:18:19.887 --> 00:18:25.430]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, I've got the latest COVID news coming up, election news coming up.
[00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:27.271]  I want to get into the absolute
[00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:32.131]  I mean, I don't even have the word for it.
[00:18:32.131 --> 00:18:38.553]  It's beyond offensive, this stimulus bill that they're claiming is so great for us.
[00:18:38.553 --> 00:18:39.613]  I'm going to get into that in a second.
[00:18:39.613 --> 00:18:43.434]  But you know, I'm going over my news.
[00:18:43.434 --> 00:18:47.275]  I'm looking at the medical tyranny that's coming in 2021.
[00:18:47.275 --> 00:18:52.737]  They're claiming they're going to force you to have a vaccine ID coming up.
[00:18:52.737 --> 00:18:53.517]  So I'm going to explain that.
[00:18:56.617 --> 00:19:01.579]  I'm just as frustrated with President Trump as anybody else right now.
[00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:06.460]  I don't see President Trump leading from the front, instead trying to lead from behind.
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:07.661]  That's a losing approach.
[00:19:07.661 --> 00:19:14.683]  Now, having said that, President Trump is yet to make his final move.
[00:19:14.683 --> 00:19:24.306]  So, this is a man who is not going to go away quietly, and it's a man who likes making the last move.
[00:19:25.273 --> 00:19:27.934]  So, what is President Trump's final move?
[00:19:27.934 --> 00:19:30.835]  When will we see it?
[00:19:30.835 --> 00:19:36.338]  Perhaps we'll address that when we open up the phone lines.
[00:19:36.338 --> 00:19:50.624]  The frustrating thing is, Trump is just the captain of a team, and everyone else on the team is against him.
[00:19:50.624 --> 00:19:53.525]  There's an old baseball story called, Eight Men Out.
[00:19:54.628 --> 00:20:06.677]  Where the Chicago Black Sox, I forget what it's like, 1912 or something, but the Chicago Black Sox, with shoeless Joe Jackson, he was the only guy on the team that wanted to win the World Series.
[00:20:06.677 --> 00:20:09.799]  The rest were bought off and paid for by the Chicago Mafia.
[00:20:09.799 --> 00:20:12.441]  So they threw the World Series.
[00:20:12.441 --> 00:20:16.363]  Now, Joe Jackson in that World Series batted like, you know, he had an incredible series.
[00:20:16.363 --> 00:20:19.686]  He was hitting home runs and triples and stealing bases and runs and everything.
[00:20:19.686 --> 00:20:23.889]  Everyone else on the team laid down, they took the money from the Chicago Mafia.
[00:20:25.273 --> 00:20:28.436]  So that's the situation Trump is in right now.
[00:20:28.436 --> 00:20:31.478]  He's one man on the team trying to win.
[00:20:31.478 --> 00:20:39.925]  Everyone else has been bought off and paid for, whether it's the Chinese communists blackmailed by a pedophile network or actually into that crap, whatever it is.
[00:20:39.925 --> 00:20:41.086]  They're the eight men out.
[00:20:41.086 --> 00:20:41.566]  They're out.
[00:20:41.566 --> 00:20:43.127]  They don't want victory for America.
[00:20:43.127 --> 00:20:45.189]  They're not playing for victory for America.
[00:20:45.189 --> 00:20:45.829]  They're bought.
[00:20:45.829 --> 00:20:46.730]  They're blackmailed.
[00:20:46.730 --> 00:20:48.411]  They're done.
[00:20:48.411 --> 00:20:52.675]  So Trump's out there still giving it his all, but the whole team is against him.
[00:20:54.005 --> 00:20:58.107]  And the whole team is against the team itself.
[00:20:58.107 --> 00:21:09.091]  So, when I see this, when they announce, oh, 2021, the mandatory vaccine idea is coming, I'm like, hey, President Trump, can you make a statement and shut this down?
[00:21:09.091 --> 00:21:10.891]  But he's not even running that play.
[00:21:10.891 --> 00:21:17.754]  He's over here trying to run these plays, and it's just, it's just ridiculous the amount of sabotage that goes on.
[00:21:17.754 --> 00:21:18.634]  But that's where we're at.
[00:21:18.634 --> 00:21:22.956]  Now, they do this to us,
[00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:29.133]  Well, hell, I mean, they do this to us every time they pass some sort of a stimulus bill.
[00:21:29.133 --> 00:21:33.476]  But this is perhaps the most offensive thing I've ever seen.
[00:21:33.476 --> 00:21:42.602]  This stimulus bill, and pardon me for being graphic, I like being accurate in my analogies here.
[00:21:42.602 --> 00:21:47.406]  So, excuse me for being graphic, but this is just the analogy.
[00:21:47.406 --> 00:21:51.389]  What has been given to us with this stimulus bill
[00:21:52.651 --> 00:22:07.940]  Is like if the head chef of a restaurant comes up to you with a rotting old dog turd on a plate and then urinates on it in front of you and says, this is filet mignon with Bearnaise sauce.
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:12.523]  And you're like, no, that's a rotting moldy dog turd and you just urinated on it in front of me.
[00:22:12.523 --> 00:22:16.326]  He says, no, that's a filet mignon medium rare.
[00:22:16.326 --> 00:22:17.727]  Look at that.
[00:22:17.727 --> 00:22:18.427]  And it's just, you know,
[00:22:19.215 --> 00:22:22.718]  So, they're celebrating like this check is a good thing.
[00:22:22.718 --> 00:22:30.505]  Now, not everybody, but anybody who's claiming that this stimulus bill is a good thing is... I mean...
[00:22:31.598 --> 00:22:34.120]  Do we just... How do you even respond to this?
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.001]  It's so offensive.
[00:22:35.001 --> 00:22:36.402]  So let me go into this.
[00:22:36.402 --> 00:22:37.963]  Story at National File.
[00:22:37.963 --> 00:22:45.689]  Pelosi calls $600 stimulus significant, but said $1,000 employee bonuses following Trump tax cuts were crumbs.
[00:22:45.689 --> 00:22:52.654]  Well, yeah, Nancy Pelosi is a lying bitch and a fraud, so I wouldn't be surprised by that at all.
[00:22:52.654 --> 00:22:53.355]  $600 for you?
[00:22:53.355 --> 00:22:54.236]  Here's an idea.
[00:22:54.236 --> 00:22:55.196]  Open up the economy.
[00:22:55.196 --> 00:22:56.377]  No, they can't have that.
[00:22:56.377 --> 00:22:58.259]  See, you're a slave now.
[00:22:58.259 --> 00:22:59.219]  You need the government.
[00:22:59.219 --> 00:22:59.780]  That's what they want.
[00:23:01.991 --> 00:23:06.373]  Here are some, and I'm just going to go through some of this.
[00:23:06.373 --> 00:23:11.575]  $300 million for migrant and refugee assistance.
[00:23:11.575 --> 00:23:12.615]  How does that help you?
[00:23:12.615 --> 00:23:15.336]  It doesn't.
[00:23:15.336 --> 00:23:17.357]  $10,000 per person for student loan bailout.
[00:23:17.357 --> 00:23:18.338]  How does that help you?
[00:23:18.338 --> 00:23:19.678]  Well, if you have a student loan, it might.
[00:23:19.678 --> 00:23:22.239]  Otherwise, it doesn't.
[00:23:22.239 --> 00:23:24.600]  $100 million to NASA.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:25.681]  How does that benefit you?
[00:23:25.681 --> 00:23:26.301]  Probably won't.
[00:23:28.587 --> 00:23:33.331]  $20 billion to the United States Postal Service, which just helped steal our election.
[00:23:33.331 --> 00:23:37.615]  So, that's nice.
[00:23:37.615 --> 00:23:40.578]  $300 million to the Endowment of the Arts.
[00:23:40.578 --> 00:23:42.300]  That won't help you at all.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.741]  You can't even go enjoy these things.
[00:23:43.741 --> 00:23:45.483]  You can't go to the theater.
[00:23:45.483 --> 00:23:49.346]  So they're giving hundreds of millions of dollars to things that are closed.
[00:23:49.346 --> 00:23:52.269]  $300 million for the Endowment for the Humanities.
[00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:53.030]  Never even heard of this.
[00:23:54.206 --> 00:23:56.547]  You never even heard of this.
[00:23:56.547 --> 00:23:59.229]  $435 million for mental health support.
[00:23:59.229 --> 00:24:05.592]  Well, hopefully that'll be going directly to the Democrats, but not in the way it needs to.
[00:24:05.592 --> 00:24:08.834]  $30 billion for the Department of Education Stabilization Fund.
[00:24:08.834 --> 00:24:17.218]  So, they shut down the schools, they stop bringing in the revenue, they have to pay the teachers, and then they just say, oh, we're just going to bail it out.
[00:24:17.218 --> 00:24:22.461]  So all these problems caused by politicians we have to pay for, and then they say, oh, thank us.
[00:24:23.669 --> 00:24:29.711]  Another $35 million to the JFK Center for Performing Arts.
[00:24:29.711 --> 00:24:33.373]  The House of Representatives got a raise.
[00:24:33.373 --> 00:24:36.654]  $25 million for additional salary for the House of Representatives.
[00:24:36.654 --> 00:24:43.297]  Well, I guess that's why AOC, that fraud, complained about the bill all day long yesterday.
[00:24:43.297 --> 00:24:44.917]  AOC was complaining about the bill.
[00:24:44.917 --> 00:24:45.798]  You know what she did?
[00:24:45.798 --> 00:24:46.498]  She approved it.
[00:24:49.048 --> 00:24:51.610]  Yeah, that's right.
[00:24:51.610 --> 00:24:56.332]  Well, when she saw she was getting a raise, I mean, you know, she's a good capitalist.
[00:24:56.332 --> 00:24:59.434]  Don't be confused by AOC's politics.
[00:24:59.434 --> 00:25:02.516]  She is a money-grubbing political whore.
[00:25:05.655 --> 00:25:08.317]  $25 million to clean the Capitol building.
[00:25:08.317 --> 00:25:12.120]  Boy, I'll tell you, they could actually use that in the central block of the Metro D.C.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:12.700]  jail.
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:14.361]  I can tell you that from experience.
[00:25:14.361 --> 00:25:16.803]  As far as the Capitol building is concerned, I don't think so.
[00:25:16.803 --> 00:25:23.548]  But, you know, that'll probably get put right back into the politicians' hands somehow.
[00:25:23.548 --> 00:25:25.710]  $7.5 million to the Smithsonian.
[00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:27.871]  So they get a raise if you work at the Smithsonian.
[00:25:27.871 --> 00:25:28.331]  That's nice.
[00:25:28.331 --> 00:25:30.113]  That's good.
[00:25:30.113 --> 00:25:31.574]  $90 million for the Peace Corps.
[00:25:32.938 --> 00:25:36.619]  Oh, we just randomly are giving $13 million to Howard University.
[00:25:36.619 --> 00:25:38.039]  Oh, that's nice.
[00:25:38.039 --> 00:25:39.179]  That's good.
[00:25:39.179 --> 00:25:40.740]  And by the way, this benefits you how?
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:51.262]  A billion dollars to the Airlines Recycle and Save Program?
[00:25:51.262 --> 00:25:53.863]  They signed this thing, man.
[00:25:53.863 --> 00:25:56.283]  They signed this thing.
[00:25:56.283 --> 00:25:58.924]  Two and a half million dollars for public and Indian housing?
[00:26:01.906 --> 00:26:03.567]  That's nice.
[00:26:03.567 --> 00:26:05.048]  That's nice.
[00:26:05.048 --> 00:26:07.149]  Story at Infowars.com headline.
[00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:09.970]  Billions going to foreign aid and spending bill.
[00:26:09.970 --> 00:26:12.812]  Gender programs in Pakistan.
[00:26:12.812 --> 00:26:15.353]  Sri Lankan ship refurbishments.
[00:26:15.353 --> 00:26:17.554]  Wow!
[00:26:17.554 --> 00:26:24.357]  Globalist COVID stimulus package sends billions of dollars to the Gates Foundation as well!
[00:26:24.357 --> 00:26:28.520]  Isn't that just so nice?
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:28.660]  And
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.202]  I've got all of it.
[00:26:31.202 --> 00:26:34.666]  That's not even half of the most ridiculous stuff of it, folks.
[00:26:34.666 --> 00:26:40.774]  I mean, literally, most of this stimulus bill is going to foreign causes.
[00:26:40.774 --> 00:26:42.396]  Foreign countries.
[00:26:42.396 --> 00:26:42.636]  Okay?
[00:26:43.752 --> 00:26:46.453]  So, we'll continue to highlight this as the show goes on.
[00:26:46.453 --> 00:26:55.956]  We're going to be joined on the other side by Robert Barnes, but this stimulus bill is the politicians of our country pissing in our face.
[00:26:55.956 --> 00:26:56.597]  How rude.
[00:26:56.597 --> 00:26:59.878]  Webster's Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[00:27:00.678 --> 00:27:03.060]  Other dictionaries have similar ones.
[00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:10.704]  Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force for a political or financial reason.
[00:27:10.704 --> 00:27:14.586]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[00:27:14.586 --> 00:27:18.069]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[00:27:18.069 --> 00:27:20.490]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News.
[00:27:20.490 --> 00:27:22.892]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[00:27:22.892 --> 00:27:24.713]  COVID more devastating than they could ever imagine.
[00:27:25.453 --> 00:27:31.716]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago, within three months.
[00:27:31.716 --> 00:27:32.636]  Okay?
[00:27:32.636 --> 00:27:37.218]  It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things.
[00:27:37.218 --> 00:27:39.519]  We're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[00:27:39.519 --> 00:27:40.339]  These are real numbers.
[00:27:40.339 --> 00:27:41.600]  These are real facts.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:49.003]  This is the chicken little event where we all run in our houses, never come out, and are taught we're not essential, while the big box stores and Amazon take over the planet.
[00:27:49.483 --> 00:27:50.265]  Rebuke it.
[00:27:50.265 --> 00:27:51.467]  Stand up against it.
[00:27:51.467 --> 00:27:53.210]  This is slavery.
[00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:55.433]  It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:59.361]  The post-industrial world.
[00:27:59.361 --> 00:28:08.623]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[00:28:08.623 --> 00:28:13.124]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post-industrial world.
[00:28:13.124 --> 00:28:18.985]  Klaus Schwab of the Davos Group, Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, they're all on record saying the Great Reset is Agenda 2030.
[00:28:21.846 --> 00:28:24.869]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[00:28:24.869 --> 00:28:27.993]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[00:28:27.993 --> 00:28:29.955]  It is making the population poor.
[00:28:29.955 --> 00:28:35.862]  By design, so we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family.
[00:28:35.862 --> 00:28:39.185]  They're destroying civilization, rebuild it, and they're dystopic.
[00:28:40.126 --> 00:28:41.506]  Image.
[00:28:41.506 --> 00:28:45.428]  We are fighting this at Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[00:28:45.428 --> 00:28:52.570]  We are fighting for a pro-human future, and we need you to get the facts, to research it and share it with others, and join the fight.
[00:28:52.570 --> 00:28:53.450]  God bless you.
[00:28:53.450 --> 00:28:55.711]  Visit us, spread the word at Infowars.com.
[00:28:57.728 --> 00:28:59.490]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[00:28:59.490 --> 00:28:59.971]  You're on the air.
[00:28:59.971 --> 00:29:01.593]  Thanks for holding.
[00:29:01.593 --> 00:29:02.214]  I sure can, sir.
[00:29:02.214 --> 00:29:02.654]  Thank you.
[00:29:02.654 --> 00:29:05.378]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[00:29:13.548 --> 00:29:14.970]  I just want to plug in.
[00:29:14.970 --> 00:29:19.415]  I'm a truck driver and 2x4s have changed the way I drive.
[00:29:19.415 --> 00:29:26.042]  Me and my brothers that drive, a couple of us, we are Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[00:29:26.042 --> 00:29:34.070]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you
[00:29:34.150 --> 00:29:40.451]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[00:29:40.451 --> 00:29:42.731]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[00:29:42.731 --> 00:29:45.192]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[00:29:45.192 --> 00:29:47.872]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[00:29:47.872 --> 00:29:51.913]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[00:29:51.913 --> 00:29:53.693]  And you're saying that it's made your life better?
[00:29:53.693 --> 00:29:54.434]  So that means a lot to me.
[00:29:54.434 --> 00:29:54.774]  Thank you.
[00:29:54.774 --> 00:29:59.614]  To all your truck drivers, we love you.
[00:29:59.614 --> 00:30:02.255]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:25.585 --> 00:30:34.029]  Back here live in the InfoWars World Headquarters in Austin, Texas, Owen Schroer sitting in here
[00:30:35.894 --> 00:30:37.956]  on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:37.956 --> 00:30:39.297]  Merry Christmas!
[00:30:39.297 --> 00:31:01.397]  Merry Christmas from all of us here at InfoWars to you tuned in today and Merry Christmas to Robert Barnes who is joining me now from his humble abode where lots of legal thought and analysis goes down and so he joins me now to discuss the presidential election
[00:31:02.478 --> 00:31:10.808]  Robert, everybody seems focused on January 6th right now, including the President of the United States.
[00:31:10.808 --> 00:31:17.877]  Your take on where we're at right now, and how confident are you that January 6th is the day to be watching?
[00:31:19.344 --> 00:31:21.784]  It definitely is.
[00:31:21.784 --> 00:31:32.707]  Ultimately, the constitutional remedy for a presidential election that goes AWOL was always intended to be Congress, more so than the courts, more so than the state legislatures.
[00:31:32.707 --> 00:31:36.627]  That's why the Congress decides whether to certify electors.
[00:31:36.627 --> 00:31:46.069]  If they do not certify 270 or more electors for any one candidate, then under the 12th Amendment, it goes to the House to vote by state delegation.
[00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:55.178]  So the president's legal constitutional remedy is for Congress to take up the issue on January 6th.
[00:31:55.178 --> 00:31:59.001]  And it could take days because there could be objections to multiple states.
[00:31:59.001 --> 00:32:01.844]  There's anticipation of at least seven states being objected to.
[00:32:01.844 --> 00:32:08.710]  They're supposed to spend two hours apiece each chamber on their own accord debating it.
[00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:12.354]  They should allow for argument and evidence to be presented in that time frame.
[00:32:13.441 --> 00:32:17.783]  And so consequently, you could have, you know, 14 hours or more of debate time.
[00:32:17.783 --> 00:32:26.107]  So if we can spend two weeks on a bogus impeachment, we can spend at least a few days on a legitimate election contest.
[00:32:26.107 --> 00:32:29.608]  And I think that's the president's position, and it's a sound one to have.
[00:32:29.608 --> 00:32:41.193]  And then what he needs and what he wants is for there to be a mass audience outside so the House members and senators can witness the power of the support that Trump has for this election contest to occur.
[00:32:42.131 --> 00:32:50.984]  And if they if the evidence and arguments are properly heard out, then there's an excellent opportunity for the for Trump to at least succeed in the Senate.
[00:32:50.984 --> 00:32:53.268]  And then there's open question in the House.
[00:32:53.268 --> 00:32:57.514]  And so, but at a minimum, if this is parallel track for Trump.
[00:32:58.334 --> 00:33:04.336]  Because if he doesn't prevail, he wants it to be the case that Pelosi and Biden helped steal it for Biden.
[00:33:04.336 --> 00:33:07.157]  And that's the other utility of going through this process.
[00:33:07.157 --> 00:33:21.261]  Not only is it the constitutional process, not only should he prevail if they actually apply the facts and the law and the Constitution, because this election was not done in a constitutionally consistent manner in a sufficient number of states to give Joe Biden any form of electoral college majority,
[00:33:21.841 --> 00:33:30.116]  But the other advantage is if for whatever reason it doesn't work, if it doesn't work because Pelosi is the obstacle in the House with Democrats having a slight edge,
[00:33:30.757 --> 00:33:35.102]  Then it gives Trump a key talking point for the next four years.
[00:33:35.102 --> 00:33:40.087]  It gives conservatives and Republicans a key talking point for the upcoming midterms.
[00:33:40.087 --> 00:33:43.350]  And Trump can rebuild and expand his populist movement going forward.
[00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:51.419]  So Trump's always, since art of the deal, his mantra has been hope for the best, plan for the worst.
[00:33:51.419 --> 00:33:53.441]  And the January 6th plan is both.
[00:33:54.496 --> 00:33:55.457]  It's both.
[00:33:55.457 --> 00:33:57.938]  The best can happen, should happen.
[00:33:57.938 --> 00:34:02.641]  But in case it doesn't, the backup plan, it works for the backup plan, too.
[00:34:02.641 --> 00:34:03.642]  So it works for both.
[00:34:03.642 --> 00:34:06.763]  So it's a intelligent path for the president to be taking.
[00:34:06.763 --> 00:34:08.404]  It's the constitutional path.
[00:34:08.404 --> 00:34:09.285]  It's the legal path.
[00:34:09.985 --> 00:34:28.481]  And it's the only path he's been afforded effectively at this point because the state governors refuse to take action, the state secretaries of state refuse to take action, the state courts in those systems refuse to take action, the state legislatures in those states could not convene, and then the federal courts have also refused to take action.
[00:34:29.076 --> 00:34:38.853]  And so, as the President said yesterday, his Chief of Staff Mark Meadows laid out the protocols to go forward on January 6th because it's the only remedy available.
[00:34:38.853 --> 00:34:42.499]  And he just has to overcome Mitch McConnell trying to instruct everybody in the Senate.
[00:34:43.061 --> 00:34:44.501]  To not vote on it.
[00:34:44.501 --> 00:34:46.322]  But I think that ship has sailed.
[00:34:46.322 --> 00:34:50.422]  Senator Perdue out of Georgia said if he wins re-election, he's going to challenge it.
[00:34:50.422 --> 00:34:52.883]  Senator Tuberville is talking about challenging it.
[00:34:52.883 --> 00:34:55.343]  Senator Paul is talking about challenging it.
[00:34:55.343 --> 00:34:57.444]  Senator Hawley is talking about challenging it.
[00:34:57.444 --> 00:35:00.224]  Senator Cruz is now talking about challenging it.
[00:35:00.224 --> 00:35:09.626]  So, the other thing that's useful about this, however it turns out, is it's going to put everybody on notice that who's a Trump loyalist and who isn't.
[00:35:09.626 --> 00:35:10.466]  Make him have a vote.
[00:35:11.198 --> 00:35:15.459]  So to know who in the House really is supporting the President and who is not.
[00:35:15.459 --> 00:35:18.899]  Who in the Senate is really supporting the President and who is not.
[00:35:18.899 --> 00:35:22.260]  And let's be clear, it's not just supporting the President, it's supporting reality.
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:25.120]  Trump won this thing in a landslide, everybody knows it.
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:32.182]  So anybody who wants to vote against it, whether it's a Democrat or a Republican, they're just voting against reality.
[00:35:32.182 --> 00:35:32.702]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:32.702 --> 00:35:34.882]  And they're voting against a constitutional election.
[00:35:34.882 --> 00:35:39.043]  And they're voting against the constitutional process for resolving a contested election.
[00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:56.922]  So what it does, it puts on notice who's really so deeply tied to the swamp that they're unwilling to even exercise their constitutional obligation to resolve a contested election where a constitutional election clearly elects the president.
[00:35:56.922 --> 00:36:00.665]  It's only an unconstitutional election that elects Joe Biden.
[00:36:00.665 --> 00:36:05.809]  And so let's see if some of these would-be presidents like Senator Hawley and others will step up to the plate or not.
[00:36:06.389 --> 00:36:20.081]  And every senator and congressman who does not step up to the plate for a constitutional election and object to the electors from these states that did not conduct a constitutional election, then they should be primary.
[00:36:20.081 --> 00:36:23.784]  They should be focused on to be challenged in 2022 and 2024.
[00:36:23.784 --> 00:36:32.192]  So it's a great opportunity to get a clear and clean discernment at who is with the country, who is with the Constitution, and who ain't.
[00:36:32.868 --> 00:36:34.169]  And there's no better opportunity.
[00:36:34.169 --> 00:36:37.552]  So it has multiple advantages to focusing on January 6th.
[00:36:37.552 --> 00:36:41.535]  It's the constitutional remedy where if they do their job, he's the next president.
[00:36:41.535 --> 00:36:44.637]  If they don't do their job, we get to see it and witness it.
[00:36:44.637 --> 00:36:59.108]  And they both get to build for Trump over the next four years to build a broader, wider, deeper populist movement, but also to expose who within the party cannot be trusted, who within the party needs to be kicked out of the party or at least removed from their office.
[00:37:00.131 --> 00:37:05.773]  And I think that that's the multiple utility to it, and that's the path he's been planning on all along.
[00:37:05.773 --> 00:37:11.495]  So there was all the talk of martial law, insurrection act, that was never a path he was going to pursue.
[00:37:11.495 --> 00:37:17.818]  Yeah, and he came out and made that statement the other day, and he had people that were in those meetings, you know, double down and echo that.
[00:37:17.818 --> 00:37:25.241]  And of course, I mean, we're expecting, though, the millions of energized, enthusiastic Biden voters who've been everywhere to be there on January 6th.
[00:37:25.241 --> 00:37:27.361]  I mean, these Biden voters, they're everywhere, Bob.
[00:37:27.361 --> 00:37:27.922]  I mean, I can't.
[00:37:29.022 --> 00:37:30.583]  Turn a corner and there's a Biden flag.
[00:37:30.583 --> 00:37:31.924]  Oh no wait, that's Trump supporters.
[00:37:31.924 --> 00:37:37.126]  No wait, it was Trump that won more counties than any other presidential candidate ever before.
[00:37:37.126 --> 00:37:40.748]  So it'll be the millions of Trump supporters that are out there.
[00:37:40.748 --> 00:37:44.570]  Real quickly though, you know, two things.
[00:37:44.570 --> 00:37:47.152]  Let's focus on, you're talking about exposing the Republicans.
[00:37:47.152 --> 00:37:49.453]  Here's what I've realized about these people in the swamp.
[00:37:51.147 --> 00:37:53.950]  They talk behind the scenes.
[00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:55.352]  It's kind of like with any vote, right?
[00:37:55.352 --> 00:38:00.158]  They all know how the other is going to vote, probably 90% of the times they have to vote.
[00:38:00.158 --> 00:38:01.599]  And then they make their measurements.
[00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:02.721]  Alright, who's going to vote this way?
[00:38:02.721 --> 00:38:03.502]  Who's going to vote this way?
[00:38:03.502 --> 00:38:05.003]  If I vote this way, it'll be inconsequential.
[00:38:05.003 --> 00:38:06.725]  If I vote this way, it'll be inconsequential.
[00:38:07.506 --> 00:38:24.952]  I have a feeling that the Republicans are already doing that, and so there's going to be a couple Republicans that I think are probably deep in the swamp that'll vote in Trump's favor, but I don't have much confidence in this process, other than exposing the swamp for what it is, exposing the Democrats for what it is.
[00:38:26.253 --> 00:38:28.354]  I don't trust these Republicans, quite frankly.
[00:38:28.354 --> 00:38:30.315]  I don't trust anybody in Congress.
[00:38:30.315 --> 00:38:35.198]  And my fear, Bob, and in 60 seconds respond to this and we'll come back and talk more about this.
[00:38:35.198 --> 00:38:45.085]  My fear is that if we don't win this, whether it's January 6th or any of the days in between before January 21st, there is no 2024 run for Trump.
[00:38:45.085 --> 00:38:47.647]  There's no 2024 run for anybody.
[00:38:47.647 --> 00:38:51.129]  Every election is rigged after that, whether it's Democrat or Republican.
[00:38:51.129 --> 00:38:53.451]  And now they've basically been given the green light.
[00:38:53.451 --> 00:38:55.352]  Yep, we can do this and we can get away with it.
[00:38:56.636 --> 00:38:59.064]  Well, I think it's a legitimate concern for everyone to have.
[00:38:59.064 --> 00:39:02.134]  Though I think there are answers to that which we can get to after the break.
[00:39:03.168 --> 00:39:08.209]  But the first step is, the weakness with Trumpism all the way through was it lacked institutional support.
[00:39:08.209 --> 00:39:10.070]  He did not put enough allies around him.
[00:39:10.070 --> 00:39:12.190]  He did not surround himself with enough allies.
[00:39:12.190 --> 00:39:15.711]  He let Mitch McConnell pick a lot of his cabinet people and judges.
[00:39:15.711 --> 00:39:18.551]  He allowed Paul Ryan to pick his legislation.
[00:39:18.551 --> 00:39:26.333]  And the combination of the two is what doomed Trumpism to being stuck with an election that was within the margin of fraud in the first place.
[00:39:26.333 --> 00:39:31.054]  He should have been way outside the margin of fraud if he never went along with the lockdowns and the rest.
[00:39:31.594 --> 00:39:32.495]  Alright, we'll be right back.
[00:39:56.016 --> 00:39:59.138]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would.
[00:39:59.138 --> 00:40:03.420]  They've always been part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse.
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:12.865]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office for his second term on January 20th, the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic.
[00:40:12.865 --> 00:40:14.906]  They are going to explode gas prices.
[00:40:14.906 --> 00:40:17.028]  They're going to shut down our coal power plants.
[00:40:17.028 --> 00:40:19.349]  They're going to cut off the energy source to the U.S.
[00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:22.110]  So it's impossible for factories to move back here.
[00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:23.711]  This is economic domination.
[00:40:23.711 --> 00:40:24.532]  This is economic war.
[00:40:25.012 --> 00:40:26.053]  We are being consolidated.
[00:40:26.053 --> 00:40:27.255]  We are being taken over.
[00:40:27.255 --> 00:40:30.678]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states.
[00:40:30.678 --> 00:40:40.008]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heel and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property.
[00:40:40.008 --> 00:40:41.870]  This is a monopolistic takeover.
[00:40:41.870 --> 00:40:43.252]  That's what the Great Reset is.
[00:40:43.252 --> 00:40:45.414]  Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it.
[00:40:46.115 --> 00:40:47.736]  That's what social distancing is.
[00:40:47.736 --> 00:40:51.198]  So your business is only at 25% for several more years.
[00:40:51.198 --> 00:40:53.360]  No small businesses will be there.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.560]  This is a master plan.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:54.901]  Say no!
[00:40:56.827 --> 00:41:04.091]  Anybody listening to my voice can simply search into the term Davos Group, technocracy, or technocrats.
[00:41:04.091 --> 00:41:19.118]  You'll get Klaus Schwab and Jean-Claude Juncker and all the New World Order globalists like Xi Jinping saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments, that they want businessmen technocrats over them.
[00:41:19.118 --> 00:41:20.279]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[00:41:20.279 --> 00:41:22.520]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.621]  The COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[00:41:25.621 --> 00:41:29.202]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is.
[00:41:29.202 --> 00:41:34.705]  You see, he believes, because he's hidden it in plain view, and you're not speaking out against it, that he has a right to do it to you.
[00:41:34.705 --> 00:41:36.485]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[00:41:36.485 --> 00:41:38.266]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[00:41:38.266 --> 00:41:42.788]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[00:41:42.788 --> 00:41:45.669]  That means worldwide neo-feudalism in his own words.
[00:41:46.310 --> 00:41:51.744]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you before you take those shots.
[00:41:51.744 --> 00:41:54.471]  You might just want to find out who this villain is, alright?
[00:41:57.472 --> 00:41:59.853]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man?
[00:41:59.853 --> 00:42:02.615]  Is this the guy that called in about Living Defense?
[00:42:02.615 --> 00:42:03.455]  Yes, sir.
[00:42:03.455 --> 00:42:03.875]  Yes, sir.
[00:42:03.875 --> 00:42:11.399]  I've been trying to get ahold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of Living Defense in from Utah.
[00:42:11.399 --> 00:42:15.041]  I said, man, I got to get on that show and give him an update.
[00:42:15.041 --> 00:42:23.325]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones Show, I'm going to tell the world about Living Defense and what it did for me personally.
[00:42:23.325 --> 00:42:26.927]  Now, look, I'm 64 years old going on 20, thanks to
[00:42:27.267 --> 00:42:29.428]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[00:42:29.428 --> 00:42:38.014]  We didn't know, we didn't screen your call, we had no idea, and I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about Living Defense.
[00:43:08.669 --> 00:43:12.952]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[00:43:12.952 --> 00:43:16.455]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[00:43:16.455 --> 00:43:19.737]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[00:43:19.737 --> 00:43:23.280]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:25.522]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[00:43:25.522 --> 00:43:26.943]  I suggest Band.Video.
[00:43:27.603 --> 00:43:33.066]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[00:43:33.066 --> 00:43:41.550]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[00:43:41.550 --> 00:43:48.253]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[00:43:48.253 --> 00:43:51.054]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:02.902]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:02.902 --> 00:44:11.427]  We're back here with Robert Barnes.
[00:44:24.850 --> 00:44:34.779]  Attorney extraordinaire breaking down the January 6th events with the hearings and the votes that will be coming up.
[00:44:34.779 --> 00:44:41.025]  Will it give Trump the victory or will it mean another obstacle he has to overcome?
[00:44:41.025 --> 00:44:45.189]  You wanted to get back into that, Bob.
[00:44:45.189 --> 00:44:50.394]  My feeling of this is that it just has the feeling of a buzzer beater.
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:56.587]  Or to make the sports analogy, you feel like the last possession is going to win the game.
[00:44:56.587 --> 00:45:01.213]  And you know that the last possession is going to be with zero seconds left on the clock.
[00:45:01.213 --> 00:45:05.699]  Well that's not January 6th, that's essentially January 21st.
[00:45:05.699 --> 00:45:08.022]  And the strategy from President Trump
[00:45:09.246 --> 00:45:19.451]  From my perspective, I mean, I don't have inside intel coming from the White House, but just from a layman's perspective, what we're seeing is that President Trump is leading from behind right now.
[00:45:19.451 --> 00:45:22.172]  You don't really see him much, you don't really hear from him much.
[00:45:22.172 --> 00:45:27.135]  You hear from some of his attorneys, you hear from some other people with some lawsuits, you hear from some congressmen.
[00:45:27.135 --> 00:45:32.518]  But from Trump, not much as far as public statements at all, really.
[00:45:32.518 --> 00:45:34.659]  So he's kind of leading from behind, and to me that's like, okay,
[00:45:35.439 --> 00:45:38.121]  You know you're going into the fourth quarter.
[00:45:38.121 --> 00:45:41.083]  You know the last possession of the game is going to win it.
[00:45:41.083 --> 00:45:45.507]  And this is like Michael Jordan relying on Steve Kerr to take over the game in the fourth quarter.
[00:45:45.507 --> 00:45:46.728]  You're not going to win.
[00:45:46.728 --> 00:45:47.568]  You're going to lose.
[00:45:47.568 --> 00:45:55.915]  Now again, I feel that just knowing enough about Donald Trump, the man, and President Trump, the president, he's going to make the last move.
[00:45:55.915 --> 00:45:57.256]  Whatever that is.
[00:45:57.256 --> 00:46:04.642]  Whether he measures that on January 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, whatever, he's going to make the last move.
[00:46:04.642 --> 00:46:04.802]  So,
[00:46:06.036 --> 00:46:31.259]  What level of confidence do you have, if you can even put a level of confidence, that January 6th will be the day where Trump can declare victory and say he will be re-inaugurated versus it's going to be another expose of the deep state, the Republican swamp, and he's going to have to make the next measure or the next two measures before January 21st when the corrupt Chi-Com agent Biden would be inaugurated?
[00:46:33.348 --> 00:46:40.650]  Well, I think it's an uphill battle because he has too little institutional support, and that was the problem from the get-go.
[00:46:40.650 --> 00:46:53.594]  So he doesn't have enough allies in the courts, doesn't have enough allies in the institutional Republican Party, those who hold elected office, those who hold high-level managerial positions within the government.
[00:46:53.594 --> 00:46:58.836]  Many of his own appointees are unreliable allies, and he's still fighting a rearguard battle.
[00:46:58.836 --> 00:47:03.077]  I mean, it's clear that the ODNI was supposed to issue a report last week
[00:47:03.735 --> 00:47:08.617]  About whether there was foreign interference in the election under the 2018 executive order.
[00:47:08.617 --> 00:47:21.604]  There's evidence that Jack Posobiec and others have put out that they conclude that in fact, or key intelligence agents conclude that China was the principal country interfering or attempting to interfere in the elections.
[00:47:21.604 --> 00:47:29.368]  And the, in fact, the Epoch Times has put out a big documentary on the way in which China tried to influence the election and part of its overall approach to the world.
[00:47:29.368 --> 00:47:30.988]  And yet somehow that report doesn't come out.
[00:47:30.988 --> 00:47:32.269]  It's been buried until January.
[00:47:32.825 --> 00:47:40.878]  And then you get Pompeo go out and blame Russians for the hack on solar wind, even though there's no real evidence that Russians had anything to do with it.
[00:47:41.597 --> 00:47:44.058]  And then you have the same from Attorney General Barr.
[00:47:44.058 --> 00:47:46.459]  So he's fighting people within his own administration.
[00:47:46.459 --> 00:47:48.399]  And I'm glad you said that, because that's where I was going to go next.
[00:47:48.399 --> 00:47:49.920]  What do you make of Barr?
[00:47:49.920 --> 00:47:53.401]  I mean, multiple affronts to reality.
[00:47:53.401 --> 00:47:57.322]  Oh, there is no proof of fraud or theft of the election.
[00:47:57.322 --> 00:48:05.825]  And then, and you know what, I learned a little bit more about this last night, and we can get into this if you want to, if you want to switch lanes.
[00:48:05.825 --> 00:48:08.446]  It seems to me, let's get your take on Bill Barr.
[00:48:08.906 --> 00:48:12.528]  It seems to me that Bill Barr is doing two things right now.
[00:48:12.528 --> 00:48:23.432]  One, he's either playing coy, strategically, or two, he's just completely protecting the deep state, and Gina Haspel seems to be the canary in the coal mine.
[00:48:23.432 --> 00:48:36.278]  When Bill Barr says nothing happened that was suspicious at the CIA, he is clearly protecting Gina Haspel's role in the London office, he's clearly protecting Brennan, who was running the whole spy campaign,
[00:48:36.638 --> 00:48:41.662]  For him to say there was no suspicious activity, and by the way, Stephen Halper is still getting paid!
[00:48:41.662 --> 00:48:45.525]  I'm sorry, I know I'm going off into a different lane, but it kind of just traces back to this.
[00:48:45.525 --> 00:48:55.312]  I mean, is Bill Barr completely protecting the deep state, or do you think he's just playing coy right now, to then when, oh magically, he finds the evidence, he'll all of a sudden take action?
[00:48:56.704 --> 00:49:03.487]  Well, I got a friend of mine that's a meme maker that's going to be doing the Godfather scene and just replacing the name.
[00:49:03.487 --> 00:49:07.709]  Instead of it was Barzini all along, it was Barr all along.
[00:49:07.709 --> 00:49:10.610]  And replacing Marlon Brando with Trump.
[00:49:10.610 --> 00:49:12.431]  It's clear that is what actually happened.
[00:49:12.431 --> 00:49:14.512]  And this was always an issue with Barr.
[00:49:14.512 --> 00:49:21.355]  The reason why I expressed doubts, you expressed doubts, Alex expressed doubts at different times over the years was his history.
[00:49:21.875 --> 00:49:24.677]  This is a guy who came up with a very privileged family.
[00:49:24.677 --> 00:49:27.919]  His father is the one who hired Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:49:27.919 --> 00:49:32.782]  His father wrote weird books about underage sex slaves.
[00:49:32.782 --> 00:49:45.369]  His first name to fame is that he's at the CIA working with Poppy Bush to cover up various crimes and illicit activities that the church committee was trying to expose.
[00:49:45.369 --> 00:49:50.292]  That's how Barr got his break in Washington, was helping the CIA cover up criminal activity.
[00:49:50.856 --> 00:49:58.223]  Then he comes back under Poppy Bush, while he's Attorney General is when you get the Noriega nonsense, you get the BCCI.
[00:49:58.223 --> 00:50:01.426]  I mean, he and Mueller were close during that period of time.
[00:50:01.426 --> 00:50:05.970]  So this guy's been an establishment hack covering up for corruption his entire career.
[00:50:05.970 --> 00:50:11.315]  And then when Trump nominates him, he wins almost unanimous support.
[00:50:11.315 --> 00:50:14.618]  So I think all along, kind of parallel to the Q campaign,
[00:50:15.782 --> 00:50:29.571]  The rhetorical attacks on Democrats and on the left and in support of the President were meant to deceive the President into believing that Barr was meaningfully investigating and going to prosecute and punish the Spygate folks.
[00:50:29.571 --> 00:50:33.994]  That Barr was meaningfully investigating Hunter Biden and Joe Biden and the corruption.
[00:50:33.994 --> 00:50:39.458]  That Barr was meaningfully doing undercover investigations to expose voter fraud activities.
[00:50:40.079 --> 00:50:42.282]  It turned out he was doing none of the three.
[00:50:42.282 --> 00:50:46.108]  It turned out he was busy making sure to bury the SpyGate scandal.
[00:50:46.108 --> 00:50:47.491]  Durham didn't even issue a report.
[00:50:48.223 --> 00:51:15.616]  Then, on top of that, to cover up the Biden corruption, to cover up the fact that Biden had been under federal criminal investigation for years, cover up the existence of the laptop, not even disclose it during the whole impeachment scandal, and then on top of that, not only not do any meaningful undercover investigations into voter fraud, which needed to be happening before the election, not afterwards, to catch it, but going out and covering up
[00:51:16.512 --> 00:51:19.975]  And giving a fig leaf of coverage to say, oh, I haven't seen any voter fraud.
[00:51:19.975 --> 00:51:23.638]  Well, you never investigated any, so of course you didn't.
[00:51:23.638 --> 00:51:26.980]  It turns out Barr was a fraud the entire time.
[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:33.646]  I have no doubt the president asked him to resign, but the problem is Barr's replacement is just like Barr.
[00:51:33.646 --> 00:51:35.747]  So this is the core problem.
[00:51:35.747 --> 00:51:38.710]  So you don't think Rosen will be any different?
[00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:39.951]  No, he won't be any better.
[00:51:39.951 --> 00:51:43.854]  I mean, honestly, I'm looking at Trump here, and it's like,
[00:51:44.778 --> 00:51:45.319]  And I understand.
[00:51:45.319 --> 00:51:46.840]  I mean, things fall through the cracks.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:49.984]  I mean, we have a company here of maybe, I think it's like a hundred employees.
[00:51:49.984 --> 00:51:51.145]  Things fall through the cracks here.
[00:51:51.145 --> 00:51:52.647]  I mean, you know, Alex gets frustrated.
[00:51:52.647 --> 00:51:54.269]  It's impossible to micromanage everything.
[00:51:54.269 --> 00:51:55.370]  There's not enough time in the day.
[00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:57.913]  There's not enough consciousness in a human soul.
[00:51:57.913 --> 00:52:04.700]  But, I mean, it's like Trump either purposely put Barr and Haspel in there, knowing how corrupt they were,
[00:52:05.875 --> 00:52:08.859]  Or somehow they like tricked him into thinking they'd help him.
[00:52:08.859 --> 00:52:09.900]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:18.451]  When you look at now the lack of action from both of them, and then their cover up of all the crimes, their history in the deep state.
[00:52:18.451 --> 00:52:23.417]  I mean, it's like, my goodness, Haspel and Barr look like you couldn't have chose even worse candidates.
[00:52:24.724 --> 00:52:27.846]  And then you add to that people like Pompeo.
[00:52:27.846 --> 00:52:34.349]  For example, constitutionally, the Vice President could refuse to certify these electors.
[00:52:34.349 --> 00:52:43.734]  Under the Constitution, he's the one that decides what's a qualified elector and what's not, and which electors to read out and which ones not, and which ones to count and which ones not.
[00:52:43.734 --> 00:52:48.876]  And even liberal legal scholars recognize and acknowledge that Pence has that potential power.
[00:52:48.876 --> 00:52:50.057]  There's some controversy over that.
[00:52:50.117 --> 00:52:56.361]  I saw him do one rally in Georgia where he talked about it, but other than that, and it didn't get much play either, other than that, he's been pretty much on the sidelines.
[00:52:56.361 --> 00:52:58.102]  He did get a vaccine though, so that was cute.
[00:53:19.754 --> 00:53:20.514]  Exactly.
[00:53:20.514 --> 00:53:25.215]  And by the way, do we really believe for sure that these people are getting the actual vaccine?
[00:53:25.215 --> 00:53:26.076]  No, I don't for a second.
[00:53:26.076 --> 00:53:30.657]  I mean, I don't understand the visual display of this because we have no idea what's inside that needle.
[00:53:30.657 --> 00:53:31.137]  Right.
[00:53:31.137 --> 00:53:44.100]  And so the idea that this is supposed to give me confidence to run out and get an experimental vaccine for a virus that not only has an extraordinarily high survival rate, but for a virus we've never had a successful vaccine for in history.
[00:53:45.041 --> 00:53:47.323]  Which is another question.
[00:53:47.323 --> 00:53:50.607]  It feels like a bait-and-switch technique.
[00:53:50.607 --> 00:53:53.770]  They're probably getting a vitamin B12 shot or something.
[00:53:53.770 --> 00:53:58.735]  How confident must they be where they have to go on TV and do the whole optical thing?
[00:53:58.735 --> 00:53:59.616]  Look, I'm getting it.
[00:53:59.616 --> 00:54:00.197]  It's safe.
[00:54:00.197 --> 00:54:00.778]  It's effective.
[00:54:00.778 --> 00:54:01.599]  You can get it too.
[00:54:03.642 --> 00:54:05.965]  Exactly, there's no doubt about it.
[00:54:05.965 --> 00:54:12.933]  It has auras of Hillary Clinton opening up that bottle of pickles or whatever to show how strong she was.
[00:54:12.933 --> 00:54:13.874]  That was the pickle gate.
[00:54:13.874 --> 00:54:14.535]  Yes, exactly.
[00:54:14.535 --> 00:54:15.276]  The jar was already open.
[00:54:22.662 --> 00:54:29.666]  It's, well, I guess it's apropos because everything about COVID-19 has been designed to be theater.
[00:54:29.666 --> 00:54:34.769]  Alright, let's get some final takes from Robert Barnes here on the other side of this short break.
[00:54:34.769 --> 00:54:40.672]  The election, the COVID vaccine, which by the way folks, they're saying you have to take multiple vaccines, but guess what?
[00:54:40.672 --> 00:54:43.994]  There's a new strain of COVID, so the vaccines are already irrelevant!
[00:54:45.638 --> 00:54:52.243]  It's time to show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products ever made, Alpha Power.

[00:55:36.806 --> 00:55:39.287]  Head to infowarsstore.com today.
[00:55:47.299 --> 00:56:02.500]  Imagine a dystopic novel or a dystopic science fiction movie where if you've had a cold, you can be locked up in your home, you can be taken away, you can be forcibly inoculated with drugs that masquerade as vaccines that actually change your very DNA.
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:03.542]  Well, that's where we are in the year 2020.
[00:56:04.543 --> 00:56:08.486]  Global government, the United Nations, all these authoritarian groups admit they're doing it.
[00:56:08.486 --> 00:56:16.011]  They even admit that they're doing it for power and control and that they're not even worried about COVID-19.
[00:56:16.011 --> 00:56:18.433]  That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said.
[00:56:18.433 --> 00:56:19.814]  Think about how insane that is.
[00:56:19.814 --> 00:56:21.756]  Oh, and big tech's got to track you.
[00:56:21.756 --> 00:56:22.436]  They've got to trace you.
[00:56:22.436 --> 00:56:23.317]  They've got to control you.
[00:56:23.317 --> 00:56:25.478]  You've got to have apps leave your house.
[00:56:25.478 --> 00:56:25.959]  Why?
[00:56:25.959 --> 00:56:28.661]  You've got to have secret police come disappear you because
[00:56:29.341 --> 00:56:36.147]  My God, this thing has one-tenth of one percent chance of killing you if you're debilitated and have cancer or a heart attack.
[00:56:36.147 --> 00:56:37.789]  This is their takeover.
[00:56:37.789 --> 00:56:42.633]  Imagine on America's death certificate, killed by the fear of the common cold.
[00:56:42.633 --> 00:56:43.734]  Yeah, that's fear-mongering.
[00:56:43.734 --> 00:56:49.579]  That's mind control.
[00:56:49.579 --> 00:56:52.202]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:05.359 --> 00:57:11.128]  Yeah, it's a pretty epic time to be conscious on planet Earth.
[00:57:12.793 --> 00:57:20.434]  We've got attorney Bob Barnes with us for this and the next segment, continuing to break down the election coming up.
[00:57:20.434 --> 00:57:22.115]  Let's get back into the election.
[00:57:22.115 --> 00:57:33.657]  You know, Pence could basically be a wild card here or a Trump card, pun not intended, with the discretion that he could take.
[00:57:33.657 --> 00:57:40.798]  People could debate it all day long whether he has that as part of his job, but he could do it and set that precedent.
[00:57:42.025 --> 00:57:46.288]  But I just have a feeling that this is going to have to be so extreme.
[00:57:46.288 --> 00:57:51.912]  I mean, when you steal an election like this, when you lock down a country like this, when you are so deep in criminal activity...
[00:57:53.029 --> 00:58:02.911]  I mean, I'm honestly afraid that if they put Biden in, they'll send a SWAT team with guns drawn to raid Trump's family and arrest them all the next day.
[00:58:02.911 --> 00:58:05.132]  I mean, I may be extreme in that belief.
[00:58:05.132 --> 00:58:08.773]  I just think that's how criminal they are, and they're going for broke right now.
[00:58:08.773 --> 00:58:10.133]  Now, I don't think Trump's dumb.
[00:58:10.133 --> 00:58:11.834]  I think he's probably aware of this.
[00:58:11.834 --> 00:58:12.574]  He's been in D.C.
[00:58:12.574 --> 00:58:16.835]  long enough to realize how corrupt it is, but I'm just wondering if
[00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:27.578]  The people around them that he considers allies that are probably fighting for him, like Jenna Ellis and others, if they're not underestimating how bad this criminal behavior is.
[00:58:27.578 --> 00:58:29.780]  They're focused on election fraud.
[00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:33.743]  We're talking about people that lie us into wars where millions of people die.
[00:58:33.743 --> 00:58:35.385]  I mean, you don't think for a second
[00:58:35.805 --> 00:58:42.830]  They'll come arrest Trump if they think he's a threat to their global hegemony and, you know, global government that they have coming up.
[00:58:42.830 --> 00:58:47.433]  So talk about Pence's role or potential role in this coming up.
[00:58:47.433 --> 00:58:50.676]  And I mean, just the seriousness of this criminal behavior as an attorney.
[00:58:52.495 --> 00:58:54.136]  Yeah, so two different components there.
[00:58:54.136 --> 00:58:56.236]  One, Pence clearly is President of the Senate.
[00:58:56.236 --> 00:59:02.839]  And the way the Electoral College works, like there's some talk that the Electoral College has voted not from a legal perspective.
[00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:06.660]  The vote doesn't count until the vote is certified by the relevant officials.
[00:59:06.660 --> 00:59:12.722]  And so the, and that goes to the President of the Senate, who is the current Vice President.
[00:59:12.722 --> 00:59:20.025]  And so the current Vice President has the non-reviewable authority under the Constitution to say which electors counted and which ones didn't.
[00:59:20.669 --> 00:59:23.376]  And there's some people that see that as a limited duty.
[00:59:23.376 --> 00:59:27.247]  There's others, liberal legal scholars, have acknowledged that's very broad.
[00:59:27.247 --> 00:59:28.490]  And do we have any doubt?
[00:59:29.033 --> 00:59:43.404]  That if the roles were reversed, and this was Kamala Harris or Joe Biden in 2012 for Obama or any Democrat, that they would have eagerly exercised their power to put their own party in power.
[00:59:43.404 --> 00:59:45.005]  So it's extraordinary.
[00:59:45.005 --> 00:59:45.746]  So there's no doubt.
[00:59:45.746 --> 00:59:47.807]  And here there's legitimate objections.
[00:59:47.807 --> 00:59:51.450]  We have seven states that have sent Republican electors.
[00:59:51.450 --> 00:59:53.572]  The Republican electors have voted and sent those up.
[00:59:53.972 --> 00:59:56.594]  And by the way, that was the same as 1876.
[00:59:56.594 --> 01:00:06.442]  In 1876, the official canvassing board all sent Republican electors, and then Democrats got together and sent their own electors.
[01:00:06.442 --> 01:00:10.625]  And that led to a two-month debate in Congress as to whose electors were legitimate.
[01:00:11.278 --> 01:00:23.082]  And they've passed a law since then, the Electoral Count Act, that says they'll take the votes of the governor, but that law cannot override the Constitution and cannot be binding on a new Congress, which this will be.
[01:00:23.082 --> 01:00:29.104]  Even though the Vice President is the same as the President of the Senate, the current one, the Congress members will be new.
[01:00:29.104 --> 01:00:31.805]  It will be the newly sworn in House members and Senators.
[01:00:32.345 --> 01:00:38.108]  And that's why it makes, so the, what Pence has the power to do is to say, I've got competing electors.
[01:00:38.108 --> 01:00:39.549]  You're going to have to vote on it.
[01:00:39.549 --> 01:00:51.835]  The way that, the reason why that could change the script is if he says, I'm going to say that the Republican electors are the electors, then the House and the Senate both have to override that by objecting.
[01:00:51.835 --> 01:00:56.218]  And you know, the, and that won't happen, you know, as many, or it's unlikely to happen.
[01:00:56.218 --> 01:00:58.979]  There's a risk of it given how many traitors there are.
[01:00:58.979 --> 01:01:00.400]  But that goes back to the core issue.
[01:01:01.334 --> 01:01:09.499]  Which is the problem that we have right now that for people that support a constitutional election in this case, is we have too few out.
[01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:11.680]  We had a man more than we had a movement.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:16.143]  And we did not have enough Trumpists in wide-ranging positions of power.
[01:01:16.143 --> 01:01:21.186]  Including, as people are now realizing, your local election board in your local city or county.
[01:01:21.186 --> 01:01:23.968]  Including your local state house member or state senator.
[01:01:23.968 --> 01:01:27.770]  That these positions ended up being potentially very impactful in this election.
[01:01:28.274 --> 01:01:34.079]  And what we need to realize is we need to build a Jacksonian movement of scale and scope.
[01:01:34.079 --> 01:01:37.561]  Because as you know, that's the only thing that's going to push back against any of these people.
[01:01:37.561 --> 01:01:40.964]  Otherwise they will grab power, seize power, and crush their adversaries.
[01:01:40.964 --> 01:01:44.747]  We need a mass movement to resist it and to push back against it.
[01:01:44.747 --> 01:01:52.153]  Yeah, and those local level people that I had to deal with here in Texas, they keep the Republican voters from getting fully behind Trump.
[01:01:52.153 --> 01:01:53.474]  So that could change though.
[01:01:54.366 --> 01:01:59.449]  I've got some really exciting good news, and I've also got some bad news.
[01:01:59.449 --> 01:02:06.532]  InfoWars is getting the highest traffic we have ever gotten since the election in 2016.
[01:02:06.532 --> 01:02:19.378]  Despite all the bans, all of the system trying to censor us and suppress us, you with your word of mouth have overridden that, and they are so scared of InfoWars.com and Ban.Video, and they're so scared of you being able to communicate and share the truth.
[01:02:20.999 --> 01:02:24.502]  We're bringing in the same amount of money we brought in last December right now.
[01:02:24.502 --> 01:02:28.224]  This is our most important month to be able to fund ourselves into next year.
[01:02:28.224 --> 01:02:29.845]  And I understand the economy's shut down.
[01:02:29.845 --> 01:02:31.627]  I understand there's not as much money as there used to be.
[01:02:31.627 --> 01:02:33.128]  They're trying to kill Trump's recovery.
[01:02:33.128 --> 01:02:35.309]  But InfoWars really needs your support.
[01:02:35.309 --> 01:02:47.838]  You just buy great items through your Christmas shopping at InfoWarsStore.com with huge sales, amazing products, and then you know you're funding the InfoWar and not funding Amazon and Jeff Bezos and the globalists that are openly trying to destroy small businesses.
[01:02:48.178 --> 01:02:50.520]  We're in the second hour here of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:51.421]  Owen Schroeder sitting in for Alex.
[01:02:51.421 --> 01:02:52.722]  Last segment here with Bob Barnes.
[01:02:52.722 --> 01:03:00.449]  And you know, I just have the feeling that
[01:03:12.665 --> 01:03:20.969]  It's going to come down to that old cliche, and Trump's going to realize that if you want something done right, you're just going to have to do it yourself.
[01:03:20.969 --> 01:03:27.772]  And I just have a feeling it's going to come down to that for President Trump, sadly, because of the cowards that he has surrounded himself with.
[01:03:27.772 --> 01:03:34.235]  But let's get into that other component, Bob, because I know you can run on with this subject for a long time.
[01:03:34.235 --> 01:03:36.977]  I mean, just the amount of the criminal activity, whether it's
[01:03:37.777 --> 01:03:43.000]  Uh, the government shutdowns that are killing us and now they say, oh, here's 600 bucks.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.961]  Meanwhile, billions of dollars are going out to foreign nations.
[01:03:45.961 --> 01:03:50.943]  Uh, they're just blatant theft of this election and the Supreme Court balks.
[01:03:50.943 --> 01:03:52.344]  Uh, I mean, it's just incredible.
[01:03:52.344 --> 01:03:53.905]  So that's my biggest fear here is that.
[01:03:54.827 --> 01:03:59.989]  The criminal activity level is like, I mean, it's a 10 out of 10 criminal activity.
[01:03:59.989 --> 01:04:06.252]  The fight against the criminal activity is like a 1, maybe a 2, maybe a 3 out of 10 if we're lucky.
[01:04:06.252 --> 01:04:15.997]  I mean, so it's like, I just don't see that, you know, that has, the fight against the criminal activity has to be ramped up to at least an 8 for us to have a chance.
[01:04:15.997 --> 01:04:22.600]  And again, it's like Trump is the man in the arena just looking around, waiting for reinforcements, you know, Buehler, Buehler, Buehler.
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:30.875]  Just begging someone to come along, so it's either we're going to have that rush of reinforcements next month, or I think Trump's just going to have to do it himself.
[01:04:30.875 --> 01:04:33.479]  Bob Barnes, I give you the platform here for the next eight minutes.
[01:04:34.943 --> 01:04:38.286]  So I think there's two, sort of a bifurcated approach to this.
[01:04:38.286 --> 01:04:49.435]  There's no question, the problem has been Trump, this was too much about a man, not enough about a movement, and not enough institutional allies, so that people often saw Trump as the only line of defense.
[01:04:49.435 --> 01:04:55.760]  That Trump was the last wall to protection of the Constitutional Republic against those that would take it down.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.104]  And I think the real answer is that the last wall of defense are the people themselves.
[01:05:00.726 --> 01:05:07.230]  And that means seizing and taking power constitutionally, legally, and democratically through all the means we have available to us.
[01:05:07.230 --> 01:05:11.092]  We can all, I mean, everybody can be on an election board if they fight hard enough to do it.
[01:05:11.092 --> 01:05:15.295]  Instead, we've allowed insiders to take care of our local city county election boards.
[01:05:15.295 --> 01:05:18.157]  I mean, people could have been, and this includes small counties.
[01:05:18.157 --> 01:05:21.799]  There are small rural counties, like let's say you have a problem with Dominion software.
[01:05:21.799 --> 01:05:27.202]  Well, you can get on a small county that has Dominion software and investigate it using your election board access.
[01:05:27.202 --> 01:05:30.184]  That what's happened is people look to the top to rescue them,
[01:05:30.544 --> 01:05:34.906]  When in reality, it was always going to be the ground soldiers who needed to do the rescuing.
[01:05:34.906 --> 01:05:36.666]  And that means mass movement.
[01:05:36.666 --> 01:05:40.908]  That means going and doing a mass march on January 6th in Washington, D.C.
[01:05:40.908 --> 01:05:43.309]  to show everybody that you are sticking with Trump.
[01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:44.429]  But it's not just that.
[01:05:44.429 --> 01:05:47.170]  It means taking action all across the country.
[01:05:47.170 --> 01:05:51.311]  In your local town, in your local city, in your local county, in your state.
[01:05:51.311 --> 01:05:55.353]  For state house, for state senate, for county commissioner, for election board.
[01:05:55.353 --> 01:05:55.733]  All of it.
[01:05:56.173 --> 01:06:07.100]  Because what's coming down the pipeline, it looks increasingly, given the courts are effectively closed to constitutional remedy in too many places and in too many cases, then the remedy has to be us.
[01:06:07.100 --> 01:06:19.347]  For example, look at the people that have decided to fight back against the lockdowns by recalling governor, including, it looks like Newsom's going to face a recall vote, which has shocked the Democratic establishment in California.
[01:06:19.867 --> 01:06:23.229]  The people, the Georgia Secretary of State can be recalled.
[01:06:23.229 --> 01:06:25.571]  The governor can be recalled.
[01:06:25.571 --> 01:06:39.340]  So using the power and tools of direct democracy, using recall powers, using initiative and referendum powers, it looks like we're going to need to add to the state law or state constitution provisions that protect informed consent.
[01:06:39.904 --> 01:06:50.791]  That, you know, the Nuremberg Accord was designed to say that you cannot ever be forced to get invasive medical treatment without your informed consent in response to the Nazis and everything that happened.
[01:06:50.791 --> 01:07:03.839]  But now you have people out there advocating for forced vaccinations as a condition of employment, condition of education, condition of access to travel, or even required period as a condition of citizenship under penalty of fine or prison.
[01:07:04.429 --> 01:07:13.291]  That means we now, while the court should push back against that, and I think there's constitutional arguments the other way, what the courts have shown is that they have been co-opted by the political establishment.
[01:07:13.291 --> 01:07:20.473]  They share the same professional class prejudices as the rest of the professional class, which has been historically and ancestrally anti-populist.
[01:07:20.473 --> 01:07:23.413]  We cannot trust them to be the ultimate solution.
[01:07:23.413 --> 01:07:30.295]  That's why I'm working with Robert Kennedy to build a mass movement to make sure the laws reflect, you know, using whatever legal remedy we have available to us,
[01:07:30.695 --> 01:07:45.825]  Whether it's the Americans with Disabilities Act that prohibits discrimination against the disabled, challenging that when they're misusing forced vaccinations or enforced masks as a condition of employment or access when that violates those laws.
[01:07:45.825 --> 01:07:50.448]  Same with HIPAA laws where they're basically forcing you to disclose information that should be medically private.
[01:07:51.048 --> 01:07:53.269]  And bringing every constitutional challenge we can.
[01:07:53.269 --> 01:08:02.712]  But in the end, we likely need to create new laws that say, no, you cannot do invasive medical treatment unless, in fact, you have informed consent from the individual.
[01:08:02.712 --> 01:08:04.252]  We do the same with elections.
[01:08:04.252 --> 01:08:06.953]  How do we prevent this from ever happening again?
[01:08:06.953 --> 01:08:08.393]  Change the election laws.
[01:08:08.393 --> 01:08:10.734]  And often this can be done through initiatives and referendums.
[01:08:10.734 --> 01:08:13.635]  Sometimes it can be done at the state level through new laws.
[01:08:13.635 --> 01:08:17.336]  It can also be done often at the city or county level, because that's where votes are counted.
[01:08:17.336 --> 01:08:18.436]  That's where votes are gathered.
[01:08:18.436 --> 01:08:20.457]  They're often gathered at your local precinct.
[01:08:20.957 --> 01:08:25.618]  Imagine if everybody had exercised their rights to be a poll watcher or a poll observer this election.
[01:08:25.618 --> 01:08:28.559]  They wouldn't have been able to get away with anywhere near what they got away with.
[01:08:28.559 --> 01:08:32.461]  So the goal is we have to take back the power ourselves.
[01:08:32.461 --> 01:08:40.423]  Relying upon and depending upon Trump to be that sole wall, to be that sole protector of liberty, was always a mistake, frankly.
[01:08:40.983 --> 01:08:49.648]  And now the President amplified that by delegating to McConnell his executive appointments, his judicial appointments.
[01:08:49.648 --> 01:08:52.430]  It's been Trump-appointed judges who have betrayed him.
[01:08:52.430 --> 01:08:56.833]  That's why I tell people, I was like, Trump just getting re-elected doesn't solve our problems.
[01:08:56.833 --> 01:09:01.856]  Because for the last four years we've had a whole host of issues that Trump has not been able to address or resolve.
[01:09:02.696 --> 01:09:10.802]  In fact, sometimes Trump is amplified because he delegated legislation to Paul Ryan, because he delegated executive appointments to Mitch McConnell.
[01:09:10.802 --> 01:09:14.044]  I mean, how did Christopher Wray end up heading the FBI?
[01:09:14.044 --> 01:09:16.686]  How did Hal Pasper end up at the CIA?
[01:09:16.686 --> 01:09:22.510]  How did Ratcliffe end up, or before Ratcliffe, Coates end up at the Director of National Intelligence?
[01:09:22.510 --> 01:09:25.912]  How did Pompeo, or before that, Mattis, end up at the State Department?
[01:09:26.552 --> 01:09:29.654]  Or the Defense Department?
[01:09:29.654 --> 01:09:32.055]  Or Tillerson at the State Department?
[01:09:32.055 --> 01:09:33.295]  Or Sessions as Attorney General?
[01:09:33.295 --> 01:09:40.018]  You can go on and on and on and on of the number of people that Trump put in positions of power that undermined and betrayed him.
[01:09:40.018 --> 01:09:49.723]  And I think he's trying to remedy what he can remedy while seeking his constitutional remedy of a contested election being resolved either in the courts or Congress.
[01:09:50.430 --> 01:09:57.454]  Uh, by doing things and hopefully he'll step forward and remove certain people from defense, remove certain people from the health and human services.
[01:09:57.454 --> 01:10:03.998]  Look at our big cyber warfare guy, Krebs, who the media have said- Oh, I mean, talk about a stab in the back.
[01:10:03.998 --> 01:10:08.661]  I mean, the Supreme Court stabbed Trump in the back, but they kind of like pat him like, uh, I'm sorry.
[01:10:08.661 --> 01:10:10.762]  But Krebs was just like, oh, I'm enjoying this.
[01:10:10.762 --> 01:10:12.003]  He like took as many jabs.
[01:10:12.003 --> 01:10:13.184]  He was like, yeah, I'm going to poke you.
[01:10:13.184 --> 01:10:14.745]  I'm going to stab you in the back as much as I can.
[01:10:15.285 --> 01:10:17.246]  But you know, you said something that was so key.
[01:10:17.246 --> 01:10:18.227]  I completely agree.
[01:10:18.227 --> 01:10:21.069]  It really, it is going to come down to we the people.
[01:10:21.069 --> 01:10:22.910]  And that can mean a bunch of different things.
[01:10:22.910 --> 01:10:30.015]  But you know, what you're talking about, getting people to understand our political system and the political science of it, I mean, that's a challenge.
[01:10:30.015 --> 01:10:35.459]  I mean, that's like walking up to a random guy on the street and saying, all right, you're a ninja now.
[01:10:35.459 --> 01:10:37.140]  Show me all your karate moves.
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:38.321]  They'll be like, you know, what?
[01:10:38.321 --> 01:10:39.702]  Like a karate chop.
[01:10:39.702 --> 01:10:42.764]  It's like, so I mean, that's a major void to fill.
[01:10:43.444 --> 01:10:44.905]  I mean, how do you see that happening?
[01:10:44.905 --> 01:10:47.768]  I mean, someone's going to have to fill that void.
[01:10:47.768 --> 01:10:48.108]  No doubt.
[01:10:48.108 --> 01:10:53.834]  I think, well, and part of that is, you know, I've been, you know, drafting letters for people as templates that they can send out.
[01:10:53.834 --> 01:10:58.298]  I drafted election contests that people could individually file in their individual states.
[01:10:58.298 --> 01:11:00.580]  People often don't know the scale of their remedies.
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:03.623]  You know, in a lot of places, ordinary people can file election contests.
[01:11:03.623 --> 01:11:04.724]  They don't need the campaign.
[01:11:04.724 --> 01:11:05.585]  They don't need anyone else.
[01:11:06.205 --> 01:11:08.206]  Uh, and that they're entitled to discovery.
[01:11:08.206 --> 01:11:12.587]  I'm going to start doing that with Open Records Act requests and FOIA requests in different states.
[01:11:12.587 --> 01:11:18.329]  You can get a lot of the data about either the machines or about the vote or about mail-in ballots or signatures.
[01:11:18.329 --> 01:11:21.250]  All these ballots, for example, are digitized in a lot of states.
[01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:23.770]  You can request it through your own Open Records Act request.
[01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:25.571]  You can find out whether the ballots are bogus.
[01:11:25.971 --> 01:11:35.638]  So I'm going to be starting drafting templates like this and the rest, but it comes back to the means of communication and means of organization, and that's where InfoWars is critical and essential.
[01:11:35.638 --> 01:11:43.924]  And that's where people supporting the model for reform and revolution in American and democratic constitutional manner is the InfoWars model.
[01:11:43.924 --> 01:11:51.270]  It's where people come together, support one another, support the infrastructure, support the institutions, and it's uniquely beneficial because
[01:11:51.810 --> 01:11:56.635]  A person can get healthier, wealthier, and wiser by participating and supporting InfoWars.
[01:11:56.635 --> 01:12:11.769]  Going to places like InfoWarsStore.com is the place to buy your Christmas gifts or the place to buy things for yourself that will make you healthier, make you wealthier because it's cheaper than the alternatives in its competition, and make you wiser because you're democratizing the media.
[01:12:11.769 --> 01:12:15.472]  Because you control, effectively, you the audience, you control InfoWars.
[01:12:15.812 --> 01:12:17.433]  There's no sugar daddy controlling it.
[01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:19.715]  There's no big corporate advertiser controlling it.
[01:12:19.715 --> 01:12:21.797]  There's no corrupt insider controlling it.
[01:12:21.797 --> 01:12:22.978]  There's only the people.
[01:12:22.978 --> 01:12:24.159]  There's only the audience.
[01:12:24.159 --> 01:12:33.006]  And this is a sustainable model by providing information and services and products that are of value to you independently and separately from the information itself.
[01:12:33.406 --> 01:12:47.288]  And we need to take this same model and continue to expand it and continue to deepen it, use it for its self-education, self-empowerment tools, and by us reasserting our power, that's how the American Revolution can be real again in America.
[01:12:47.288 --> 01:12:49.589]  Well said, Robert Barnes.
[01:12:49.589 --> 01:12:50.309]  Godspeed.
[01:12:50.309 --> 01:12:51.969]  Merry Christmas, Robert.
[01:12:51.969 --> 01:12:54.350]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:55.570]  Just in time for Christmas.
[01:12:55.570 --> 01:12:56.550]  One of our best sellers.
[01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:57.190]  Sold out for months.
[01:12:57.190 --> 01:12:58.450]  He's now back in stock.
[01:12:58.450 --> 01:12:59.351]  Living defense.
[01:12:59.351 --> 01:13:01.851]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is a next-level probiotic.
[01:13:02.091 --> 01:13:02.191]  It's
[01:13:23.029 --> 01:13:23.689]  We're good to go!
[01:13:52.025 --> 01:13:59.370]  The year 2021 is almost here, and so we're launching our New Year's specials right now.
[01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:00.810]  We've got two different big sales.

[01:14:08.055 --> 01:14:12.738]  We've got Bodies, Vazo Beats, and Knockout, part of the New Year's Resolution Revitalize Pack,

[01:14:21.325 --> 01:14:22.606]  The best deal ever.
[01:14:22.606 --> 01:14:28.050]  I want to thank you all for your support and encourage you to go to InfoWarsTore.com today and take advantage of this.
[01:14:28.050 --> 01:14:30.792]  And you can't lose because it funds the InfoWar.

[01:14:38.238 --> 01:14:44.744]  Again, the year 2021 is here, and I am committed to you to fight against the globalists harder than ever.
[01:14:44.744 --> 01:14:47.366]  So thank you so much for keeping InfoWars in the fight.
[01:14:47.366 --> 01:14:54.392]  Without your support, we couldn't do any of it.
[01:14:54.392 --> 01:14:57.055]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:12.266 --> 01:15:13.407]  Big Brother.
[01:15:13.407 --> 01:15:15.208]  Mainstream media.
[01:15:15.208 --> 01:15:17.090]  Government cover-ups.
[01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:18.791]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:15:18.791 --> 01:15:20.453]  Well, so does he.
[01:15:20.453 --> 01:15:25.557]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:15:25.557 --> 01:15:28.620]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:15:28.620 --> 01:15:30.781]  I want to get back into the
[01:15:32.145 --> 01:15:41.009]  Massive theft that is being called the COVID stimulus bill.
[01:15:41.009 --> 01:15:47.252]  Headline at Infowars.com, Rand Paul slams Republicans voting for COVID bill.
[01:15:47.252 --> 01:15:51.554]  You are no better than socialist Dems.
[01:15:51.554 --> 01:15:54.795]  And he sums it up quite nicely here.
[01:15:54.795 --> 01:15:59.177]  Senator Rand Paul slammed Republicans Monday for voting in favor of a huge $900 billion
[01:16:03.274 --> 01:16:10.448]  Coronavirus relief bill saying that they are no better than the Democrats they routinely label as socialists.
[01:16:14.224 --> 01:16:24.470]  When you pass, when you vote, quoting Rand Paul now, when you vote to pass out free money, you lose your soul and you abandon forever any semblance of moral or fiscal integrity.
[01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:29.934]  If free money was the answer, if money really did grow on trees, why not give more free money?
[01:16:29.934 --> 01:16:31.235]  Why not give it out all the time?
[01:16:31.235 --> 01:16:32.896]  Why stop at $600 per person?
[01:16:32.896 --> 01:16:33.216]  Why not $1,000?
[01:16:33.216 --> 01:16:33.476]  Why not $2,000?
[01:16:35.197 --> 01:16:40.199]  Maybe these new free money Republicans should join the Everybody Gets a Guaranteed Income Caucus.
[01:16:40.199 --> 01:16:42.020]  Why not $20,000 a year for everybody?
[01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:43.141]  Why not $30,000?
[01:16:43.141 --> 01:16:45.782]  If we can print out money with impunity, why not do it?
[01:16:45.782 --> 01:16:49.483]  The Senator proclaimed.
[01:16:49.483 --> 01:16:53.625]  So, show me the lie.
[01:16:53.625 --> 01:16:56.366]  Show me where Rand Paul is wrong about this.
[01:16:56.366 --> 01:16:59.768]  You know, I see this bill
[01:17:01.158 --> 01:17:06.661]  And I look at this Congress and I just wonder, are all of you corrupt dirtbags?
[01:17:06.661 --> 01:17:09.402]  Are all of you bought and sold out by somebody?
[01:17:09.402 --> 01:17:14.385]  Whether it's China, or Israel, or whoever it is.
[01:17:14.385 --> 01:17:18.027]  Why do you do this to us?
[01:17:18.027 --> 01:17:20.748]  It's an insult to our intelligence.
[01:17:20.748 --> 01:17:23.569]  It's an insult to our integrity.
[01:17:23.569 --> 01:17:28.452]  And it's a death blow to our economy.
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:37.087]  Now again, I'm going to go over some of these details of where the money is going, but Rand Paul is right!
[01:17:37.087 --> 01:17:45.576]  Why should we pay a nickel in taxes when they just take our money and give it to all these foreign nations?
[01:17:45.576 --> 01:17:46.997]  They should just be paying us!
[01:17:48.117 --> 01:17:52.899]  Now, of course, I don't want to live in a government-run economy.
[01:17:52.899 --> 01:17:55.139]  I want to live in a free market economy.
[01:17:55.139 --> 01:17:56.500]  I love the free market.
[01:17:56.500 --> 01:17:58.340]  In the free market, you can be a communist.
[01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.881]  That's the beauty of the free market.
[01:17:59.881 --> 01:18:01.141]  You can be whatever you want.
[01:18:01.141 --> 01:18:02.301]  You can be a commie.
[01:18:02.301 --> 01:18:03.942]  You can be a capitalist.
[01:18:03.942 --> 01:18:05.002]  You can be charitable.
[01:18:05.002 --> 01:18:06.523]  You can do whatever the hell you want.
[01:18:06.523 --> 01:18:09.444]  It's the free market.
[01:18:09.444 --> 01:18:10.824]  But this is theft.
[01:18:10.824 --> 01:18:16.266]  So they tax us out the wazoo, and then they pat us on the head and say, oh, here's 600 bucks.
[01:18:18.621 --> 01:18:27.251]  Look at where all the other spending is going.
[01:18:27.251 --> 01:18:31.615]  You've got $169 million to Vietnam, $169 million to Vietnam, $198 million to Bangladesh, $130 million to Nepal,
[01:18:42.256 --> 01:18:55.590]  Over $500 million to Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama to address key factors that contribute to migration of unaccompanied, undocumented minors in the United States.
[01:18:55.590 --> 01:18:56.571]  You know what that means?
[01:18:56.571 --> 01:19:00.975]  That means that money is going to be used to bring more illegal immigrants here.
[01:19:00.975 --> 01:19:02.377]  How do you like that?
[01:19:02.377 --> 01:19:04.359]  Where they'll steal your money again.
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:11.201]  74 million to the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative.
[01:19:11.201 --> 01:19:14.402]  By the way, this is all at Infowars.com.
[01:19:14.402 --> 01:19:18.063]  The headline, billions going to foreign aid and spending bill.
[01:19:18.063 --> 01:19:24.786]  Gender programs in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, ship refurbishments.
[01:19:24.786 --> 01:19:31.428]  Unspecified amounts, but it's in the tens of millions, potentially reaching hundreds of millions, to Colombia, Peru, Ecuador,
[01:19:32.435 --> 01:19:39.037]  Trinidad and Tobago and others for assistance for communities and countries supporting otherwise impacted by refugees from Venezuela.
[01:19:39.037 --> 01:19:46.599]  I thought this was the COVID relief bill!
[01:19:46.599 --> 01:19:47.419]  Foiled again!
[01:19:47.419 --> 01:19:54.861]  This is a quote from the bill itself.
[01:19:54.861 --> 01:19:59.023]  Indo-Pacific Strategy in the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018.
[01:20:01.081 --> 01:20:16.908]  Of the funds appropriated under Titles 3 and 4 of this Act, not less than 1.4 billion shall be made available to support the implementation of the Indo-Pacific Strategy and the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018.
[01:20:16.908 --> 01:20:21.330]  Well, I mean, that's obviously COVID relief, right?
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:47.456]  I mean, when you're thinking about how your business is shut down, your restaurant's closing, your bar's closing, you can't go to school, you can't go to church, I mean, you're laying awake at night tossing and turning, miserable, thinking, if only I could give one and a half billion to the Indo-Pacific Strategy and the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act, then I could sleep.
[01:20:48.695 --> 01:20:50.455]  Where do you think that money's going, folks?
[01:20:50.455 --> 01:20:52.936]  Special interest payoffs.
[01:20:52.936 --> 01:21:00.418]  Our entire Congress is compromised and it makes me sick.
[01:21:00.418 --> 01:21:02.959]  To Tulsi Gabbard's credit, she called it out too.
[01:21:02.959 --> 01:21:07.080]  She said, I'm not voting for this crap.
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:08.040]  Just goes on and on.
[01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.440]  I got all this here.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:11.081]  Why not just boil it down to this?
[01:21:12.352 --> 01:21:15.676]  Here's some of the domestic funding that'll save you from COVID.
[01:21:15.676 --> 01:21:18.180]  $26 million for the Kennedy Center, Nancy Pelosi's little baby.
[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:24.208]  A billion dollars for the Smithsonian, where they hide history.
[01:21:24.208 --> 01:21:26.972]  $154 million for the National Art Gallery, that'll fight COVID.
[01:21:27.884 --> 01:21:31.286]  Another $167 million for the National Art and Humanities.
[01:21:31.286 --> 01:21:34.647]  That's definitely how you fight COVID and relief.
[01:21:34.647 --> 01:21:37.388]  The Woodrow Wilson Center gets $14 million.
[01:21:37.388 --> 01:21:39.589]  He's a fighter of COVID.
[01:21:39.589 --> 01:21:41.170]  Foreign countries receiving aid.
[01:21:41.170 --> 01:21:43.011]  Egypt gets over a billion.
[01:21:43.011 --> 01:21:46.652]  That's how you relieve COVID stimulus in America.
[01:21:46.652 --> 01:21:47.973]  Sudan gets $700 million.
[01:21:47.973 --> 01:21:49.914]  Ukraine gets $453 million.
[01:21:49.914 --> 01:21:52.735]  Israel gets half a billion.
[01:21:52.735 --> 01:21:54.496]  Go figure for that little tiny country.
[01:21:54.496 --> 01:21:55.116]  Half a billion.
[01:22:01.913 --> 01:22:03.913]  We are getting raped, man!
[01:22:03.913 --> 01:22:06.394]  We are getting raped!
[01:22:06.394 --> 01:22:06.894]  Raped!
[01:22:06.894 --> 01:22:08.095]  I mean, this is a joke.
[01:22:08.095 --> 01:22:13.037]  Our Congress, I think this is the 116th Congress, you are a joke.
[01:22:13.037 --> 01:22:14.697]  You all belong in jail.
[01:22:14.697 --> 01:22:16.018]  In fact, I'm dead serious.
[01:22:16.018 --> 01:22:17.899]  Anybody who signed this bill should go to jail.
[01:22:17.899 --> 01:22:18.499]  And guess what?
[01:22:18.499 --> 01:22:20.399]  Some of my favorite congressmen signed this bill.
[01:22:20.399 --> 01:22:22.040]  Josh Hawley from Missouri signed this bill.
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.481]  He says, well, the people need 600 bucks.
[01:22:23.481 --> 01:22:23.701]  600 bucks?! !
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:33.925]  And again, over a bill to some Asian deal.
[01:22:33.925 --> 01:22:36.669]  So you get no COVID relief.
[01:22:36.669 --> 01:22:39.512]  You get no COVID relief.
[01:22:39.512 --> 01:22:43.397]  $900 billion and you get no COVID relief.
[01:22:43.397 --> 01:22:44.239]  I haven't done the math.
[01:22:45.555 --> 01:22:51.119]  But I wonder what 900 billion divided by whatever the amount of people in America are is.
[01:22:51.119 --> 01:22:53.560]  Probably more than 600 is my guess.
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:54.361]  Not much.
[01:22:54.361 --> 01:22:55.642]  It's still ridiculous.
[01:22:55.642 --> 01:22:56.722]  Here's an idea.
[01:22:56.722 --> 01:22:58.303]  Reopen the economy.
[01:22:58.303 --> 01:23:02.046]  Oh, but they're not interested in that because they're bought and paid for by China.
[01:23:02.046 --> 01:23:03.907]  They're bought and paid for by Israel.
[01:23:03.907 --> 01:23:06.088]  They do whatever the hell they're told to do.
[01:23:06.088 --> 01:23:09.611]  And so they just voted to financially rape you.
[01:23:09.611 --> 01:23:12.713]  You just got financially cornholed by this bill.
[01:23:13.803 --> 01:23:17.675]  Now I do believe President Trump can still veto this, and he damn well should.
[01:23:17.675 --> 01:23:19.601]  So yeah, you could have gotten almost $3,000 a person.
[01:23:21.894 --> 01:23:23.554]  Via this stimulus bill, you get $600.
[01:23:23.554 --> 01:23:27.875]  That is a spit in your eye from this corrupt Congress.
[01:23:27.875 --> 01:23:29.856]  You're all a bunch of dogs!
[01:23:29.856 --> 01:23:31.856]  You're all a bunch of dogs!
[01:23:31.856 --> 01:23:37.837]  This Congress is a bunch of dogs, including that bitch AOC who says, this is the worst spending bill ever!
[01:23:37.837 --> 01:23:38.658]  I can't believe it!
[01:23:38.658 --> 01:23:40.198]  And then she signed her name on it.
[01:23:40.198 --> 01:23:40.578]  You know why?
[01:23:40.578 --> 01:23:42.418]  Because she got a raise in this bill.
[01:23:42.418 --> 01:23:45.559]  You didn't get jack crap, but Congress gave themselves a raise.
[01:23:45.559 --> 01:23:47.579]  You all ought to be ashamed of yourselves.
[01:23:47.579 --> 01:23:49.760]  Americans should be pissed off about this!
[01:23:51.349 --> 01:23:58.631]  Anybody listening to my voice can simply search into the term Davos Group, technocracy or technocrats.
[01:23:58.631 --> 01:24:10.095]  You'll get Klaus Schwab and Jean-Claude Juncker and all the New World Order globalists like Xi Jinping saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments.
[01:24:10.815 --> 01:24:13.501]  That they want businessmen technocrats over it.
[01:24:13.501 --> 01:24:14.763]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[01:24:14.763 --> 01:24:20.253]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[01:24:20.253 --> 01:24:22.698]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is.
[01:24:23.916 --> 01:24:29.298]  See, he believes because he's hidden it to blame you, and you're not speaking out against it, that he has a right to do it to you.
[01:24:29.298 --> 01:24:31.359]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[01:24:31.359 --> 01:24:32.780]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[01:24:32.780 --> 01:24:37.301]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[01:24:37.301 --> 01:24:39.582]  That means worldwide neo-feudalism.
[01:24:39.582 --> 01:24:40.843]  It is what works.
[01:24:40.843 --> 01:24:46.265]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you, before you take those shots.
[01:24:46.265 --> 01:24:48.926]  You might just want to find out who this villain is, alright?
[01:24:51.434 --> 01:24:53.815]  The post-industrial world.
[01:24:53.815 --> 01:25:03.077]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[01:25:03.077 --> 01:25:07.598]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post-industrial world.
[01:25:07.598 --> 01:25:13.459]  Klaus Schwab of the Davos Group, Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, they're all on record saying the Great Reset is Agenda 2030.
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:19.323]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[01:25:19.323 --> 01:25:22.466]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[01:25:22.466 --> 01:25:24.428]  It is making the population poor.
[01:25:24.428 --> 01:25:30.333]  By design, so we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family.
[01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:33.636]  They're destroying civilization, rebuilding it, and they're dystopic.
[01:25:34.597 --> 01:25:35.978]  Image.
[01:25:35.978 --> 01:25:39.900]  We are fighting this at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:47.023]  We are fighting for a pro-human future, and we need you to get the facts, to research it and share it with others, and join the fight.
[01:25:47.023 --> 01:25:47.924]  God bless you.
[01:25:47.924 --> 01:25:51.385]  Visit us, spread the word, at InfoWars.com.
[01:25:51.385 --> 01:25:53.587]  You must guard your humanity.
[01:25:53.587 --> 01:25:56.448]  You must guard your children's humanity.
[01:25:56.448 --> 01:25:59.229]  You must guard the very genetic code of the planet.
[01:25:59.229 --> 01:26:02.211]  The globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this world.
[01:26:03.504 --> 01:26:07.726]  They are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet.
[01:26:07.726 --> 01:26:15.129]  They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on Earth through the GMO crops.
[01:26:15.129 --> 01:26:22.092]  And now they've moved on to their main target, humanity, with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines.
[01:26:22.092 --> 01:26:26.334]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted, cloned fetuses.
[01:26:27.603 --> 01:26:33.167]  We're then inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems.
[01:26:33.167 --> 01:26:40.231]  Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned.
[01:26:40.231 --> 01:26:43.113]  This is the equivalent of an alien takeover.
[01:26:43.113 --> 01:26:49.296]  Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us.
[01:26:49.296 --> 01:26:53.679]  It's all the same in the end.
[01:26:53.679 --> 01:26:56.301]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:05.953 --> 01:27:10.075]  Alright, look, I'm just fighting, flipping mad here.
[01:27:10.075 --> 01:27:15.018]  I mean, we are getting just raped by our Congress right now.
[01:27:15.018 --> 01:27:19.060]  Just raped intellectually with this stimulus bill financially.
[01:27:19.060 --> 01:27:20.401]  It's just an insult.
[01:27:20.401 --> 01:27:21.581]  So I'm pretty mad about that.
[01:27:21.581 --> 01:27:22.682]  They're stealing our elections.
[01:27:22.682 --> 01:27:24.323]  They're shutting down our government.
[01:27:24.323 --> 01:27:27.385]  It's time for we the people just declare independence again.
[01:27:27.385 --> 01:27:31.547]  And so this is a whole debate and Nick Fuentes is about to join me.
[01:27:31.547 --> 01:27:34.689]  Before I do that, folks, I barely plugged today.
[01:27:34.689 --> 01:27:35.209]  We have
[01:27:36.525 --> 01:27:38.186]  Wintersun Plus right here with me.
[01:27:38.186 --> 01:27:40.347]  In fact, I'm going to take it on air right now.
[01:27:40.347 --> 01:27:44.670]  I'm going to be like Joe Biden and Fauci and then they like to take the vaccine on air, right?
[01:27:44.670 --> 01:27:45.270]  It's good.
[01:27:45.270 --> 01:27:45.750]  Look at me.
[01:27:45.750 --> 01:27:47.211]  I got a little prick in my arm.
[01:27:47.211 --> 01:27:48.372]  Whoop-de-doo!
[01:27:48.372 --> 01:27:51.434]  So, you know, if it's even the real vaccine.
[01:27:51.434 --> 01:27:55.556]  This is actually Wintersun Plus that I will ingest right now.
[01:27:59.155 --> 01:28:02.281]  It's been very hazy and foggy in Texas lately.
[01:28:02.281 --> 01:28:07.011]  I'm not getting much sun, so I'm not getting much vitamin D, so I take the Winter Sun Plus there.
[01:28:07.011 --> 01:28:09.396]  Everybody knows vitamin D, essential to your immune system.
[01:28:11.124 --> 01:28:16.165]  80% of the COVID deaths, that's the real flu deaths, not the people that jump off of buildings or, you know, get shot.
[01:28:16.165 --> 01:28:21.946]  But the actual COVID deaths, 80% of them are deficient in vitamin D. But Fauci won't tell you that.
[01:28:21.946 --> 01:28:25.807]  He wants to sell you a vaccine because he is a henchman of big pharma.
[01:28:25.807 --> 01:28:29.768]  So, InfoWarsTore.com, Wintersun Plus, back in stock.
[01:28:29.768 --> 01:28:32.749]  50% off right now for you at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:28:32.749 --> 01:28:34.969]  All right, Nick Fuentes is with me.
[01:28:34.969 --> 01:28:36.629]  I know he's fighting mad too.
[01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:38.950]  He probably can control his temper better than I.
[01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:49.533]  In fact, I think I know why Nick wears the largest headphones in the history of radio, so he can drown out all the nonsense coming from Washington, D.C.
[01:28:49.533 --> 01:28:50.673]  Nick, where do you want to begin?
[01:28:50.673 --> 01:28:52.093]  The election theft?
[01:28:52.093 --> 01:28:56.955]  The financial and the rape of our integrity with the stimulus bill?
[01:28:56.955 --> 01:28:58.995]  Where do you want to begin?
[01:28:58.995 --> 01:29:01.976]  How about we start with the stimulus bill?
[01:29:01.976 --> 01:29:04.117]  That's a juicy one, isn't it?
[01:29:04.117 --> 01:29:06.197]  Yeah, I talked about that on my show last night.
[01:29:06.197 --> 01:29:07.558]  Hey, $600, Nick!
[01:29:07.558 --> 01:29:08.758]  You can get a stick of gum!
[01:29:10.014 --> 01:29:11.015]  Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[01:29:11.015 --> 01:29:12.937]  You can chew your way out of this pandemic.
[01:29:12.937 --> 01:29:17.441]  You can get one stick of flavored bubblegum.
[01:29:17.441 --> 01:29:18.221]  I love to see it.
[01:29:18.221 --> 01:29:22.425]  Yeah, well, I mean, the $1,200 was an insult, in my opinion.
[01:29:22.425 --> 01:29:26.649]  Back when they did the original stimulus, $1,200 wasn't sufficient.
[01:29:26.649 --> 01:29:28.951]  And then they cut it in half.
[01:29:28.951 --> 01:29:35.417]  And what's amazing is not just how little is in this bill, but how much is in the bill for seemingly everybody else.
[01:29:36.206 --> 01:29:39.489]  You know, they tell us that they can't do better than $600.
[01:29:39.489 --> 01:29:41.170]  Another round of cash payments.
[01:29:41.170 --> 01:29:43.031]  Only two rounds of cash payments, by the way.
[01:29:43.031 --> 01:29:47.175]  Take down the whole economy and they give you two checks for less than two grand in one year.
[01:29:48.090 --> 01:30:01.680]  What's more, is in the same bill, $1.4 trillion stimulus bill, they've got money for Sudan, they've got money for Myanmar, Nepal, Israel, all these foreign nations, but they can't cut us more than $600.
[01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:09.265]  And even more, when you look at the math, I was looking at it last night, how they actually break down each provision in the bill.
[01:30:09.898 --> 01:30:21.662]  The direct cash payments only account for about $287 billion out of the $900 billion stimulus, which is included in a $1.4 trillion spending bill.
[01:30:21.662 --> 01:30:32.625]  And so you think about these numbers, it's a third of the total stimulus is actually going to Americans, and it's less than a fourth out of the entire spending bill.
[01:30:32.625 --> 01:30:34.566]  And where else is all that money going towards?
[01:30:35.578 --> 01:30:36.698]  You know, we have some idea.
[01:30:36.698 --> 01:30:37.839]  It's going to foreign wars.
[01:30:37.839 --> 01:30:39.759]  It's going to the World Health Organization.
[01:30:39.759 --> 01:30:41.499]  It's going to other countries.
[01:30:41.499 --> 01:30:42.480]  It's a disgrace.
[01:30:42.480 --> 01:30:44.700]  And you know what people have to realize?
[01:30:44.700 --> 01:30:52.442]  I talked about this on my show last night, too, is you have to tie this in with what's going on with the Senate right now and what's going on with the election, too.
[01:30:52.442 --> 01:30:57.043]  Because this was a bill, this was a deal that was made by both Republicans and Democrats.
[01:30:57.043 --> 01:31:02.124]  Trump wanted more than $2,000 in cash payments for each individual.
[01:31:02.895 --> 01:31:03.675]  They wound up with 600.
[01:31:03.675 --> 01:31:07.256]  That was an agreement between McConnell and Nancy Pelosi.
[01:31:07.256 --> 01:31:09.257]  This is what the status quo looks like.
[01:31:09.257 --> 01:31:19.000]  Once they get Trump out of office, once he's out of the White House, it's back to this business as usual, where it's Republicans and Democrats, both of them, working together to screw over the American people.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:22.281]  And they do it with the lockdown, and then they don't pay you enough in the stimulus.
[01:31:22.281 --> 01:31:26.743]  So I think it's a disgrace, and I think this is probably what the next four years is going to look like.
[01:31:27.861 --> 01:31:39.727]  When you, I mean, just, you don't need to be that well-educated or, you know, financially privy to understand how this bill is such a theft and it doesn't even make sense on its face.
[01:31:39.727 --> 01:31:48.012]  There needs to be, you know what, I mean, I'm almost to a point now, it's like, forget about the special counsel under the Bidens or whatever, you know what, that'll never go away.
[01:31:48.012 --> 01:31:50.393]  The criminals are never going to stop committing crimes.
[01:31:50.393 --> 01:31:53.655]  They say that's the nice thing about the mob, they never stop breaking the law, but
[01:31:54.375 --> 01:31:57.858]  I mean, there needs to be an investigation into Pelosi and McConnell.
[01:31:57.858 --> 01:31:59.840]  Who came up with these numbers?
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:04.204]  Why the hell are foreign nations getting our stimulus bill?
[01:32:04.204 --> 01:32:09.349]  Why are foreign nations getting more dollars per capita than us?
[01:32:09.349 --> 01:32:12.191]  I mean, seriously, there needs to be a criminal investigation into this.
[01:32:12.191 --> 01:32:14.894]  This is so egregious on its face.
[01:32:14.894 --> 01:32:18.818]  I mean, Americans should literally be like, I got a little fired up yesterday after what happened in Oregon.
[01:32:19.598 --> 01:32:25.084]  You know, BLM gets to torture people and murder people and Antifa murder people and burn down buildings and all this stuff.
[01:32:25.084 --> 01:32:29.990]  But, oh, you show up with a Trump and American flag and you just want to go into your state capitol, you get assaulted by the police.
[01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:31.371]  So I was a little upset with that.
[01:32:31.371 --> 01:32:32.673]  But this is like the same thing!
[01:32:32.673 --> 01:32:35.496]  I mean, seriously, like, what the hell is going on?
[01:32:35.996 --> 01:32:44.343]  I mean, President Trump is focusing on the election theft, but I mean, he should come out and do a fireside chat tonight and just lay all of it out.
[01:32:44.343 --> 01:32:47.125]  Be like, why are we giving $500 million to Israel?
[01:32:47.125 --> 01:32:51.288]  Well, he may not say that, but I mean, you know, he could say it all about all the other countries.
[01:32:51.288 --> 01:32:54.290]  It's like, where is the stimulus for the American people here?
[01:32:54.290 --> 01:32:57.292]  And then Nancy Pelosi will come back and say, okay, we're going to actually give you $666.66.
[01:33:02.438 --> 01:33:10.327]  Well, and, you know, what's so disgusting about this is they're always pushing on us for whatever reason that they don't have the money for this.
[01:33:10.327 --> 01:33:17.195]  Well, we have to issue austerity or we have to usher in an era of austerity after they destroyed the economy.
[01:33:17.195 --> 01:33:18.777]  They destroyed the economy.
[01:33:18.777 --> 01:33:20.979]  You know, this is something very important to point out.
[01:33:20.979 --> 01:33:22.942]  It wasn't COVID that took down the economy.
[01:33:23.482 --> 01:33:24.483]  COVID is a disease.
[01:33:24.483 --> 01:33:27.746]  It was government policies that took down the economy.
[01:33:27.746 --> 01:33:31.028]  COVID didn't force restaurants to close and businesses to close.
[01:33:31.028 --> 01:33:32.409]  The federal government did.
[01:33:32.409 --> 01:33:33.050]  We know now.
[01:33:33.829 --> 01:33:38.993]  That the death rate for COVID is, what is it, like .0001%?
[01:33:38.993 --> 01:33:41.094]  We know that COVID didn't shut down everything.
[01:33:41.094 --> 01:33:43.396]  The federal government forced businesses to close.
[01:33:43.396 --> 01:33:47.399]  I mean, forced them into a situation where they could not make money, could not do business.
[01:33:47.399 --> 01:33:58.366]  And now that people are unemployed, now that small businesses are imploding across the country, now that people are underemployed and their kids can't go to school, they say, well, the best we could do is $600.
[01:33:58.366 --> 01:33:59.387]  Really?
[01:33:59.387 --> 01:34:00.528]  And they tell us that the
[01:34:01.380 --> 01:34:08.063]  Fiscal conservatives tell us, well, we can't do much more on unemployment because then people would rather take the unemployment than work.
[01:34:08.063 --> 01:34:12.146]  We can't make the benefits too big because the deficit's already grown so much.
[01:34:12.146 --> 01:34:12.426]  Really?
[01:34:12.426 --> 01:34:14.327]  Well, when has that ever been a problem?
[01:34:14.327 --> 01:34:20.650]  Because, you know, for the past 20 years, I don't know if you're aware of this, we've been at war in both Iraq and Afghanistan at the same time.
[01:34:21.090 --> 01:34:27.112]  And also Syria, and also Somalia, and also West Africa, and also Pakistan, and also Yemen.
[01:34:27.112 --> 01:34:28.933]  And we never seem to run out of money for that.
[01:34:28.933 --> 01:34:31.854]  We never seem to be concerned about the deficit for that.
[01:34:31.854 --> 01:34:33.614]  And there's never any shortage of money for that.
[01:34:33.614 --> 01:34:35.875]  But when it comes to them wrecking the economy...
[01:34:36.658 --> 01:34:41.461]  And now people are looking for work and people are destroyed by this, financially and otherwise.
[01:34:41.461 --> 01:34:46.644]  Well, now they, you know, they empty their pockets and say, oh, $600, that's the best we could do.
[01:34:46.644 --> 01:34:46.964]  Really?
[01:34:46.964 --> 01:34:49.506]  I mean, and people have got to stand up.
[01:34:49.506 --> 01:34:54.389]  You know, what I saw in Oregon last night, or yesterday rather, was epic.
[01:34:54.389 --> 01:35:00.312]  And I don't know, maybe there needs to be a little bit more of that, because this is the kind of stuff that we fought the revolution for in the beginning.
[01:35:00.312 --> 01:35:01.613]  I'm not advocating for violence.
[01:35:01.613 --> 01:35:04.555]  I'm not advocating for anything, you know, crazy.
[01:35:05.160 --> 01:35:09.544]  But this is exactly the kind of stuff that we fought the revolution over in 1776.
[01:35:09.544 --> 01:35:12.407]  No taxation without representation.
[01:35:12.407 --> 01:35:13.988]  I don't feel very represented.
[01:35:13.988 --> 01:35:18.152]  I don't know about you, but I haven't felt represented in a long time.
[01:35:18.152 --> 01:35:23.397]  Maybe we should just move to Israel or Sudan or hell, Egypt.
[01:35:23.397 --> 01:35:24.298]  Egypt got a Bill .3.
[01:35:27.045 --> 01:35:27.486]  That's right.
[01:35:27.486 --> 01:35:31.953]  Yeah, I guess we'd have a better shot of getting representation in government if we lived in a foreign country.
[01:35:31.953 --> 01:35:32.554]  What did we buy?
[01:35:32.554 --> 01:35:35.098]  What did we just like buy Cleopatra's DNA or something?
[01:35:35.098 --> 01:35:37.161]  I mean, what the hell?
[01:35:37.161 --> 01:35:40.767]  Well, I mean, it's all ultimately all of that is in service of the
[01:35:41.536 --> 01:35:44.277]  Kushner sort of arrangement in the Middle East.
[01:35:44.277 --> 01:35:45.478]  700 million dollars to Sudan.
[01:35:45.478 --> 01:35:46.859]  And why do you think that was?
[01:35:46.859 --> 01:35:53.322]  Well, maybe that has something to do with the fact that Sudan just inked a deal to normalize their relations with Israel recently.
[01:35:53.322 --> 01:36:00.166]  And, you know, Egypt became the number two recipient of foreign aid after the Camp David Accords with Israel back in the late 1970s.
[01:36:00.166 --> 01:36:02.507]  A similar deal with Jordan in the early 1990s.
[01:36:02.507 --> 01:36:02.727]  So, you know,
[01:36:04.688 --> 01:36:10.874]  Kind of all roads lead to, frankly, to Jerusalem over there when it comes to foreign aid to the Middle East.
[01:36:10.874 --> 01:36:11.955]  Really neither here nor there.
[01:36:11.955 --> 01:36:17.000]  The point is the money should be going to Americans, not people in the Middle East, whether they're in Jordan, Egypt, Israel.
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:17.981]  It should be going to us.
[01:36:17.981 --> 01:36:19.022]  It should be going to the people that
[01:36:19.815 --> 01:36:31.864]  And you know, these politicians, these snakes, Pelosi and McConnell are so vicious and so maniacal, the way they do this, is we'll never be able to track and trace who gets all these kickbacks.
[01:36:31.864 --> 01:36:33.465]  Because you know they're getting kickbacks.
[01:36:33.465 --> 01:36:36.647]  I mean, even AOC was saying how bad this is, but then she signed the bill.
[01:36:36.647 --> 01:36:37.468]  Why?
[01:36:37.468 --> 01:36:39.590]  Because she got a raise!
[01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:41.991]  So they put a raise for Congress in here!
[01:36:41.991 --> 01:36:45.154]  So most Congressmen, oh I'm not signing this, oh wait, I get a raise?
[01:36:45.154 --> 01:36:46.415]  Okay, I'll sign it then.
[01:36:46.415 --> 01:36:47.255]  Oh, magic!
[01:36:47.255 --> 01:36:47.856]  Oh, way to go!
[01:36:49.531 --> 01:36:52.693]  Fox has betrayed President Trump as I predicted they would.
[01:36:52.693 --> 01:36:56.515]  They've always been part of the establishment and it's only going to get worse.
[01:36:56.515 --> 01:37:06.381]  If they're able to keep Trump from rightfully taking office for a second term on January 20th, the system is going to drop the hammer harder than ever on this republic.
[01:37:06.381 --> 01:37:08.422]  They are going to explode gas prices.
[01:37:08.422 --> 01:37:10.543]  They're going to shut down our coal power plants.
[01:37:10.543 --> 01:37:12.885]  They're going to cut off the energy source to the U.S.
[01:37:12.885 --> 01:37:15.186]  So it's impossible for factories to move back here.
[01:37:15.606 --> 01:37:17.207]  This is economic domination.
[01:37:17.207 --> 01:37:18.507]  This is economic war.
[01:37:18.507 --> 01:37:19.567]  We are being consolidated.
[01:37:19.567 --> 01:37:20.768]  We are being taken over.
[01:37:20.768 --> 01:37:24.189]  The Democrats aren't mismanaging their blue cities and states.
[01:37:24.189 --> 01:37:33.512]  They're consolidating power and control to bankrupt the population and bring them absolutely to heel and then consolidate ownership of all the infrastructure and property.
[01:37:33.512 --> 01:37:35.393]  This is a monopolistic takeover.
[01:37:35.393 --> 01:37:36.753]  That's what the Great Reset is.
[01:37:36.753 --> 01:37:38.914]  Klaus Schwab and these other criminals admit it.
[01:37:39.634 --> 01:37:41.257]  That's what social distancing is.
[01:37:41.257 --> 01:37:44.703]  So your business is only at 25% for several more years.
[01:37:44.703 --> 01:37:46.887]  No small businesses will be there.
[01:37:46.887 --> 01:37:48.070]  This is a master plan.
[01:37:48.070 --> 01:37:48.430]  Say no!
[01:37:50.259 --> 01:37:53.661]  The globalists and their minions want to play God.
[01:37:53.661 --> 01:37:56.803]  Chuckie Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama.
[01:37:56.803 --> 01:38:01.146]  You look at these sacks of garbage and you think, why do they hate humanity so much?
[01:38:01.146 --> 01:38:02.807]  Why do they love death?
[01:38:02.807 --> 01:38:05.789]  Because they hate themselves.
[01:38:05.789 --> 01:38:10.452]  They project their own disgust with their soul onto us.
[01:38:11.472 --> 01:38:16.637]  And once you understand that basic psychological point, every other answer is completely clear.
[01:38:16.637 --> 01:38:18.378]  That's why they hate InfoWars.
[01:38:18.378 --> 01:38:19.499]  We believe in humanity.
[01:38:19.499 --> 01:38:20.700]  We think you're beautiful.
[01:38:20.700 --> 01:38:22.342]  We think you're amazing.
[01:38:22.342 --> 01:38:27.747]  InfoWars knows you're fallen, but that you have God's potential that God gave you.
[01:38:27.747 --> 01:38:30.189]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here.
[01:38:30.189 --> 01:38:31.390]  It's now upon us.
[01:38:31.390 --> 01:38:36.915]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about InfoWars now more than ever, when the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth.
[01:38:37.596 --> 01:38:39.138]  We know you're going to override these globalists.
[01:38:39.138 --> 01:38:40.541]  We know you're going to defeat them.
[01:38:40.541 --> 01:38:43.246]  I just want to salute you all for your action, everything you've already done.
[01:38:43.246 --> 01:38:46.612]  Because God's on our side, and the globalists know it.
[01:38:50.168 --> 01:38:52.550]  Hey, Alex, how you doing, man?
[01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:55.392]  Is this the guy that called in about Living Defense?
[01:38:55.392 --> 01:38:56.133]  Yes, sir.
[01:38:56.133 --> 01:38:56.573]  Yes, sir.
[01:38:56.573 --> 01:39:04.099]  I've been trying to get ahold of you since Monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of Living Defense in from Utah.
[01:39:04.099 --> 01:39:07.742]  I said, man, I got to get on that show and give him an update.
[01:39:07.742 --> 01:39:16.028]  I said, if I ever get a chance to be on Alex Jones Show, I'm going to tell the world about Living Defense and what it did for me personally.
[01:39:16.028 --> 01:39:19.270]  Now, look, I'm 64 years old going on 20, thanks to this.
[01:39:20.391 --> 01:39:22.513]  So it's like God working is so amazing.
[01:39:22.513 --> 01:39:23.053]  We didn't know.
[01:39:23.053 --> 01:39:24.614]  We didn't screen your call.
[01:39:24.614 --> 01:39:25.395]  We had no idea.
[01:39:25.395 --> 01:39:29.277]  And I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about Living Defense.
[01:39:29.277 --> 01:39:29.998]  Living Defense.
[01:39:29.998 --> 01:39:30.718]  Living Defense.
[01:39:50.365 --> 01:39:52.747]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:39:52.747 --> 01:39:53.968]  Just in time for Christmas.

[01:39:54.949 --> 01:39:55.590]  Sold out for months.
[01:39:55.590 --> 01:39:56.851]  He's now back in stock.
[01:39:56.851 --> 01:39:57.752]  Living defense.

[01:40:53.010 --> 01:40:55.732]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:05.536 --> 01:41:11.561]  And now, the tip of the spear, leading the fight to take back the nation.
[01:41:11.561 --> 01:41:14.343]  It's Owen Troyer.
[01:41:14.343 --> 01:41:20.067]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:20.067 --> 01:41:32.817]  This country's in big trouble when we are being leveraged, when we are being leveraged by our politicians to the tunes of billions of dollars to other countries.
[01:41:34.653 --> 01:41:40.396]  I mean, folks, to put it frankly, we're fudged.
[01:41:40.396 --> 01:41:41.557]  We're fudged.
[01:41:41.557 --> 01:41:44.018]  We can't do this anymore, man.
[01:41:44.018 --> 01:41:46.219]  Americans are going broke.
[01:41:46.219 --> 01:41:50.261]  We have rampant homelessness in this country.
[01:41:50.261 --> 01:41:53.523]  We have the economy crashing.
[01:41:53.523 --> 01:42:00.287]  And our Congress just gave us a big fat middle finger and a knife in our back.
[01:42:01.297 --> 01:42:04.158]  I mean, I'm just stunned.
[01:42:04.158 --> 01:42:11.321]  I'm just stunned at the egregiousness, the insult, that they would even put this bill on the table.
[01:42:11.321 --> 01:42:15.223]  And there needs to be an immediate investigation into Pelosi and McConnell.
[01:42:15.223 --> 01:42:17.084]  In fact, I want a hearing.
[01:42:17.084 --> 01:42:22.946]  I want a national hearing on national TV, and I want Rand Paul, and even AOC!
[01:42:22.946 --> 01:42:24.107]  Hell, put AOC in there!
[01:42:24.107 --> 01:42:25.227]  Let her grill them too!
[01:42:25.227 --> 01:42:26.168]  Give her the platform!
[01:42:26.548 --> 01:42:34.811]  I want her, and I want Rand Paul, and I want all of them asking, where did you decide and why did you decide to give Egypt 1.3 billion?
[01:42:34.811 --> 01:42:37.112]  I'd just like to hear your reasoning for that.
[01:42:37.112 --> 01:42:40.693]  By the way, half a billion to Israel, which is about the size of a thumbnail.
[01:42:40.693 --> 01:42:41.753]  Just curious!
[01:42:41.753 --> 01:42:42.994]  Just tell us why!
[01:42:42.994 --> 01:42:43.514]  Let's hear it!
[01:42:43.514 --> 01:42:50.756]  I mean, I think the American people deserve to hear why they get 600 bucks and a kick in the ass, and Egypt gets 1.3 billion dollars.
[01:42:50.756 --> 01:42:51.917]  I think the American people deserve that.
[01:42:51.917 --> 01:42:54.818]  Of course, we won't get this because Congress hates you.
[01:42:55.658 --> 01:42:58.079]  I'm convinced they just hate us at this point.
[01:42:58.079 --> 01:43:00.739]  Uh, by the way, sad story.
[01:43:00.739 --> 01:43:03.420]  Just to show you how crazy the world is.
[01:43:03.420 --> 01:43:04.400]  Family of U.S.
[01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:08.581]  student jailed for quarantine violation pleads for her release.
[01:43:08.581 --> 01:43:18.223]  A young 18-year-old girl, Skylar Mack, broke quarantine at the Cayman Islands and is being held against her will in jail.
[01:43:18.883 --> 01:43:26.446]  So, walking on a beach now puts you in jail, and I don't hear anyone from the United States government trying to get her release there.
[01:43:26.446 --> 01:43:27.247]  But hey!
[01:43:27.247 --> 01:43:31.129]  Make sure Egypt gets 1.3 billion dollars.
[01:43:31.129 --> 01:43:38.292]  I guarantee you most Americans couldn't find Egypt, Sudan, Ukraine, Israel, Nepal, Burma, Cambodia, or Pakistan on a map!
[01:43:39.178 --> 01:43:42.119]  And they just got over a billion dollars.
[01:43:42.119 --> 01:43:43.880]  Nick, I'm just ranting at this point.
[01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:45.080]  Nick Fuentes is with us.
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:46.101]  America first.
[01:43:46.101 --> 01:43:48.041]  By the way, Nick, I think it's hilarious.
[01:43:48.041 --> 01:43:49.042]  People do this to me, too.
[01:43:49.042 --> 01:43:53.664]  How they like to steal your name and then act like their name.
[01:43:53.664 --> 01:43:55.884]  You know, we won't get into the beached whales that do that.
[01:43:55.884 --> 01:43:57.405]  But I do think it's funny.
[01:43:57.405 --> 01:43:58.866]  They like to do that here with us, too.
[01:43:58.866 --> 01:44:01.827]  They take the name War Room and then they act like they came up with it.
[01:44:01.827 --> 01:44:02.707]  Not that we came up with it.
[01:44:02.707 --> 01:44:03.707]  It's an old term.
[01:44:03.707 --> 01:44:05.868]  But it's like, oh, we're the War Room.
[01:44:05.868 --> 01:44:08.029]  No, we were the War Room and now you're pretending to be the War Room.
[01:44:08.029 --> 01:44:09.769]  Well, I'm America first!
[01:44:09.769 --> 01:44:11.390]  No, you just stole that from Nick Fuentes.
[01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:13.710]  Anyway, Nick, I'm just ranting here.
[01:44:13.710 --> 01:44:24.392]  I don't even know how to direct this anger other than to just hope that the American people will get so upset about this, whether we can stop this bill from raping us or not.
[01:44:24.392 --> 01:44:26.992]  I mean, it's time for Americans to start asking questions.
[01:44:26.992 --> 01:44:36.014]  It's time for politicians to start owning up to the trillions of dollars we give to foreign countries that they do without a single question asked.
[01:44:38.370 --> 01:44:39.971]  Yeah, well, it's a disgrace.
[01:44:39.971 --> 01:44:44.415]  It's clear now that America is owned by foreign powers.
[01:44:44.415 --> 01:44:45.957]  And you could see that in the elections.
[01:44:45.957 --> 01:44:50.120]  You could see that in the electoral process, the legislative process.
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:51.001]  And that's exactly right.
[01:44:51.001 --> 01:44:55.245]  I mean, people should begin to ask themselves, where is all that money going to and why?
[01:44:55.245 --> 01:45:00.809]  Really ask yourself why there's a single cent going to Myanmar, right?
[01:45:00.809 --> 01:45:03.131]  And going to Nepal and countries like that.
[01:45:03.131 --> 01:45:06.094]  What kind of infrastructure exists on the
[01:45:06.943 --> 01:45:09.065]  International level to make that happen.
[01:45:09.065 --> 01:45:11.887]  What exactly is the benefit for the Americans?
[01:45:11.887 --> 01:45:14.769]  You know, and that's really the critical thesis of my show.
[01:45:14.769 --> 01:45:16.310]  Is America first?
[01:45:16.310 --> 01:45:18.331]  How is this putting Americans first?
[01:45:18.331 --> 01:45:25.496]  Yeah, I mean, if I could, like, travel to Nepal or Israel or Ukraine and get, like, a free housing and free meals, okay, maybe then that's alright.
[01:45:25.496 --> 01:45:27.278]  Alright, we get to go there and get... We should!
[01:45:27.278 --> 01:45:28.819]  I mean, we'd pay for all their shit!
[01:45:29.119 --> 01:45:30.320]  So we might as well get free stuff.
[01:45:30.320 --> 01:45:31.801]  I'm sorry, excuse me, we can't curse here.
[01:45:31.801 --> 01:45:39.865]  But seriously, I should be able to go to Egypt and be treated like a damn king because we make their entire damn country.
[01:45:39.865 --> 01:45:40.605]  It's true.
[01:45:40.605 --> 01:45:41.126]  It's true.
[01:45:41.126 --> 01:45:43.107]  They live like kings and we're not.
[01:45:43.107 --> 01:45:46.008]  You know, Donald Trump said that I think about 30 years ago and it's true.
[01:45:46.008 --> 01:45:46.288]  He did.
[01:45:46.288 --> 01:45:47.069]  He ran on that.
[01:45:48.055 --> 01:45:48.935]  Yeah, that's right.
[01:45:48.935 --> 01:45:49.636]  That's right.
[01:45:49.636 --> 01:45:52.537]  And I think ultimately that's what 2020 was about.
[01:45:52.537 --> 01:45:56.378]  It's about taking back that power from the people, taking back that power from Trump.
[01:45:56.378 --> 01:46:08.864]  It's really telling to me that even in spite of everything that President Trump has been put through in the past seven weeks with this whole election fraud, he's still in the White House fighting for more money in those direct cash payments for Americans.
[01:46:08.864 --> 01:46:11.225]  I think that kind of tells you everything you need to know.
[01:46:11.225 --> 01:46:16.867]  It was Trump initially, the only one in the White House, who was saying that we should have a bigger cash payment in the first
[01:46:17.387 --> 01:46:18.872]  Stimulus back in the spring.
[01:46:18.872 --> 01:46:22.001]  It was the third bill, but the first cash payment from the stimulus.
[01:46:22.001 --> 01:46:23.325]  He was saying it should have been way more.
[01:46:23.325 --> 01:46:24.688]  He's saying it should be way more now.
[01:46:25.399 --> 01:46:41.443]  And I think that if Trump leaves office on January 20th, and I think it's looking more and more likely that that's the case, there goes the last man in government, literally the last man, the only man in government that cares about the American people and that wants to put the American people first.
[01:46:41.443 --> 01:46:45.164]  And you talk about conducting an investigation or conducting a hearing.
[01:46:45.164 --> 01:46:47.725]  I mean, the problem is the whole system is bogus.
[01:46:47.725 --> 01:46:49.885]  I mean, I know that's a hypothetical, but think of it.
[01:46:49.885 --> 01:46:51.346]  I mean, who would do the investigating?
[01:46:51.346 --> 01:46:51.866]  The FBI?
[01:46:52.526 --> 01:46:57.189]  The CIA, the NSA, the DOJ, I mean, all these institutions are corrupt.
[01:46:57.189 --> 01:47:00.951]  Bill Barr, Gina Haspel, Christopher Wray, all of them.
[01:47:00.951 --> 01:47:02.272]  And then how about another hearing?
[01:47:02.272 --> 01:47:12.178]  I mean, how many hearings have we had in the past 12 months about BLM riots and Antifa riots in Portland, about big tech, about, you name it, it results in nothing.
[01:47:12.178 --> 01:47:18.162]  And at a certain point, all this righteous indignation from the American people has to result in something.
[01:47:18.966 --> 01:47:29.151]  And I think the elites have got to realize that, you know, just because you steal the election and just because you ban us from Twitter and just because you kick us out of the conversation, it doesn't mean we disappear.
[01:47:29.151 --> 01:47:35.695]  You know, there are 74 million people, at least, that voted for Trump that are very not happy with the way things are going right now.
[01:47:36.435 --> 01:47:40.719]  And you kick all those people off Twitter, you disenfranchise them from the electoral system.
[01:47:40.719 --> 01:47:46.744]  Now all you've done is eliminated legitimate means through the system by which they could redress their grievances.
[01:47:46.744 --> 01:47:48.686]  What's left after that?
[01:47:48.686 --> 01:47:49.726]  Maybe you shouldn't answer that.
[01:47:49.726 --> 01:47:51.368]  Maybe people shouldn't answer that.
[01:47:51.368 --> 01:47:53.610]  It might get them in trouble from the government.
[01:47:53.610 --> 01:47:57.953]  But at some point, there has to be justice for what's going on in the country.
[01:47:59.417 --> 01:48:02.258]  And we can't resolve that through the electoral process.
[01:48:02.258 --> 01:48:04.439]  I don't know, we're in uncharted waters at that point.
[01:48:04.439 --> 01:48:10.382]  And you see throughout this past seven weeks with the Stop the Steal, the system is failing on every level.
[01:48:10.382 --> 01:48:17.425]  From the state level, all the way through the courts, through the federal government, through the bureaucracy and the departments, the intelligence community.
[01:48:17.425 --> 01:48:18.506]  The whole thing's corrupt.
[01:48:18.506 --> 01:48:21.007]  From top to bottom, vertically, horizontally.
[01:48:21.007 --> 01:48:22.527]  The whole thing's gotta go.
[01:48:22.527 --> 01:48:25.769]  And either we're gonna have a great purge, I think, in the next four years,
[01:48:26.559 --> 01:48:32.303]  A great purge of every last Republican representative that betrayed us, a great purge of every bureaucrat in D.C.
[01:48:32.303 --> 01:48:34.025]  that's part of the swamp.
[01:48:34.025 --> 01:48:42.791]  Or things could get very ugly in this country, but I think that's the infamous slogan you guys talk about on the show, 1776 happening again.
[01:48:42.791 --> 01:48:48.835]  I hope that people are beginning to ferment a revolutionary consciousness in their mind when they see this kind of stuff.
[01:48:48.835 --> 01:48:52.638]  Like you said, it's outrageous, and there have to be answers.
[01:48:52.638 --> 01:48:54.279]  I hope the Republican Party understands this.
[01:48:55.421 --> 01:49:00.985]  Look, if they want to line their pockets with all this cash, you know what?
[01:49:00.985 --> 01:49:03.026]  At least fight for us.
[01:49:03.026 --> 01:49:06.908]  And they're not going to be able to do that when and if they're voted out of office.
[01:49:06.908 --> 01:49:12.732]  You know, it sounds to me like we're kind of on the same page here and we can come back and talk more about this.
[01:49:12.732 --> 01:49:13.693]  I'm not confident.
[01:49:13.693 --> 01:49:18.796]  I've heard every different scenario laid out for me for the last four weeks about Trump's path to victory.
[01:49:18.796 --> 01:49:22.839]  I've kind of just ho-hummed it every single one of them because it's a joke.
[01:49:22.839 --> 01:49:23.979]  We had elections, he won.
[01:49:25.220 --> 01:49:27.323]  Okay, but wait, we have all these stopgaps.
[01:49:27.323 --> 01:49:28.344]  No, he already won.
[01:49:28.344 --> 01:49:29.626]  Like, what are you doing?
[01:49:29.626 --> 01:49:32.569]  So I have no confidence in all these things that have been laid out, quite frankly.
[01:49:32.569 --> 01:49:41.680]  I'm not trying to demoralize the audience, but the only thing that I really have is my instinct tells me not to bet against Trump.
[01:49:42.461 --> 01:49:44.244]  And I just can't.
[01:49:44.244 --> 01:49:45.545]  I have no foresight.
[01:49:45.545 --> 01:49:48.069]  I have no future sight of Biden ever getting in the White House.
[01:49:48.069 --> 01:49:50.132]  I just can't really see that happening.
[01:49:50.132 --> 01:49:52.134]  It just doesn't seem like that could ever be a reality.
[01:49:52.134 --> 01:49:54.237]  Maybe that's just my bias.
[01:49:54.237 --> 01:49:55.860]  Is that kind of where you stand right now, too?
[01:49:56.991 --> 01:49:58.012]  Yeah, I agree with you.
[01:49:58.012 --> 01:50:02.358]  I think that's actually a nice way of putting it about seeing Biden in the White House.
[01:50:02.358 --> 01:50:04.261]  It's difficult for me to picture it.
[01:50:04.261 --> 01:50:06.283]  But I agree with you about all these different options.
[01:50:06.283 --> 01:50:14.314]  You know, we've watched for the past seven weeks and they tell us, well, there's this pathway where this case in Texas is going to really, that's really going to do it in.
[01:50:15.447 --> 01:50:16.268]  January 6th.
[01:50:16.268 --> 01:50:20.791]  Mike Pence is going to not count votes and that's going to prevent Biden from getting 270.
[01:50:20.791 --> 01:50:25.154]  I've heard it all and honestly, I just have no faith in the system.
[01:50:25.154 --> 01:50:27.355]  You know, I basically feel similar to you.
[01:50:27.355 --> 01:50:29.777]  I have no faith in the system because you're right.
[01:50:29.777 --> 01:50:31.998]  Trump won and we saw it was a joke.
[01:50:31.998 --> 01:50:33.399]  It was like a third world country.
[01:50:33.399 --> 01:50:37.002]  I mean, they literally send everybody home who's supposed to watch the ballots.
[01:50:37.362 --> 01:50:45.791]  And then they're bringing out suitcases full of ballots hidden under the table, and then they get right to counting those at three in the morning in Milwaukee and Detroit and Atlanta.
[01:50:45.791 --> 01:50:47.693]  I mean, this is literally what it looks like in Africa.
[01:50:47.693 --> 01:50:51.938]  This is literally what it looks like in Mexico or Brazil or something.
[01:50:51.938 --> 01:50:55.602]  And after that happened, I thought, it's very unlikely that we pull it off.
[01:50:56.294 --> 01:50:58.495]  I mean, there was a means by which we could have achieved that.
[01:50:58.495 --> 01:51:01.076]  Through the state legislatures, there was a path.
[01:51:01.076 --> 01:51:03.237]  Through the Supreme Court, there was a path.
[01:51:03.237 --> 01:51:10.239]  But, if you haven't been paying attention for the past four years, the Supreme Court has been missing an action on just about everything.
[01:51:10.239 --> 01:51:15.341]  And that is, with the three justices Trump appointed, without them, and same for state legislatures.
[01:51:15.341 --> 01:51:16.022]  Woah, woah, woah.
[01:51:16.022 --> 01:51:17.242]  Now, come on a second.
[01:51:17.242 --> 01:51:21.604]  The Supreme Court is fighting for the right for a man to have a child.
[01:51:22.344 --> 01:51:29.494]  And so I think that for you to discount that here on this show is very bigoted of you.
[01:51:29.494 --> 01:51:30.335]  Okay?
[01:51:30.335 --> 01:51:31.837]  Men can have babies.
[01:51:31.837 --> 01:51:34.060]  There's no such thing as biology here.
[01:51:34.060 --> 01:51:34.420]  Alright?
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:37.424]  So the Supreme Court is going to make sure that a man can have a child.
[01:51:37.424 --> 01:51:38.265]  Forget about an election.
[01:51:38.846 --> 01:51:42.707]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[01:51:42.707 --> 01:51:47.028]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[01:51:47.028 --> 01:51:55.531]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:51:55.891 --> 01:52:12.494]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[01:52:12.494 --> 01:52:23.536]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[01:52:24.036 --> 01:52:32.524]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[01:52:32.524 --> 01:52:38.069]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfowarsStore.com.
[01:52:39.847 --> 01:52:53.836]  The Pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United Nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin.
[01:52:53.836 --> 01:52:55.858]  It's all now completely official.
[01:52:55.858 --> 01:53:00.661]  Part of the UN Great Reset of the Devos Group and Klaus Schwab.
[01:53:01.221 --> 01:53:06.203]  All officially written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them.
[01:53:06.203 --> 01:53:07.844]  Agenda 21, Agenda 2030.
[01:53:07.844 --> 01:53:08.544]  It's here.
[01:53:08.544 --> 01:53:13.926]  And only gets worse, like being fed into a wood chipper, or a meat grinder, until you reject it all.
[01:53:15.743 --> 01:53:22.064]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's a spiritual battle, good versus evil, and stopping abortion.
[01:53:22.064 --> 01:53:24.225]  We must start valuing human life again.
[01:53:24.225 --> 01:53:31.127]  We must start saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential.
[01:53:31.127 --> 01:53:33.887]  Until we do that, we are all slaves.
[01:53:33.887 --> 01:53:37.268]  We must stand up and declare our basic God-given human rights now.
[01:53:42.941 --> 01:53:53.812]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:53.812 --> 01:54:07.265]  Yeah, you know, I'd like to just close my eyes and listen to country music and just forget about all this craziness, but...
[01:54:08.336 --> 01:54:12.739]  Eventually they'll knock on my door and put a vaccine in my arm and chain me to the wall.
[01:54:12.739 --> 01:54:15.561]  Can't really do that, unfortunately.
[01:54:15.561 --> 01:54:18.182]  That's not the America we live in anymore.
[01:54:18.182 --> 01:54:21.304]  Nick Fuentes is going to be with us for another couple segments here.
[01:54:25.481 --> 01:54:29.564]  A group of patriots in Oregon just tried to go into the state capitol that's illegally shut down.
[01:54:29.564 --> 01:54:31.385]  They got assaulted by police.
[01:54:31.385 --> 01:54:35.287]  Now, their biggest mistake was they didn't carry a Black Lives Matter flag.
[01:54:35.287 --> 01:54:43.332]  You see, if they would have done that, the police would have taken a knee, shined their shoes, cleaned their butts, maybe even given them some money.
[01:54:43.332 --> 01:54:50.096]  But no, if you have an American flag or a Trump flag, you get beat and you get arrested and told you have no rights.
[01:54:50.096 --> 01:54:52.638]  Oh, by the way though, this is shocking.
[01:54:54.051 --> 01:55:03.598]  If for the thousands of patriots that went to the state capitol in Oregon yesterday, tried to get in and were rejected, no property damage!
[01:55:03.598 --> 01:55:04.859]  Wow!
[01:55:04.859 --> 01:55:06.541]  I mean, that's amazing!
[01:55:06.541 --> 01:55:19.210]  I mean, it's amazing how BLM and Antifa have a summer of riots, 2 billion plus property damage, Trump's had rallies and marches and all this stuff with millions of people, zero dollars ever in property damage.
[01:55:19.210 --> 01:55:22.433]  I mean, I don't know how we do that, but Nick, did you see this one?
[01:55:23.809 --> 01:55:24.890]  I was stunned.
[01:55:24.890 --> 01:55:26.892]  So first I didn't realize this.
[01:55:26.892 --> 01:55:34.441]  About 100 Black Lives Matter protesters showed up in Milwaukee last night, or two nights ago.
[01:55:35.606 --> 01:55:40.770]  I'm not sure when it was, but they showed up at this event called the Candy Cane Lane.
[01:55:40.770 --> 01:55:41.791]  Okay, so this was Friday night.
[01:55:41.791 --> 01:55:48.057]  So it's a tradition in Milwaukee, Candy Cane Lane, and they raise money for children with cancer.
[01:55:48.057 --> 01:55:55.223]  And BLM showed up and shut down a charitable march for kids with cancer.
[01:55:55.223 --> 01:55:58.085]  So, I mean, they really are righteous.
[01:55:58.085 --> 01:56:00.007]  BLM is really righteous in their cause.
[01:56:02.296 --> 01:56:03.817]  Oh yeah, they're great people.
[01:56:03.817 --> 01:56:09.259]  Well, this epitomizes everything that they've been about from the beginning, which is ethnic narcissism.
[01:56:09.259 --> 01:56:10.839]  Ethnic narcissism.
[01:56:10.839 --> 01:56:14.561]  I mean, of course, this is just so prototypical that they show up
[01:56:15.399 --> 01:56:16.380]  Black lives matter.
[01:56:16.380 --> 01:56:18.601]  And of course, a lot of them are black.
[01:56:18.601 --> 01:56:20.022]  Our lives matter.
[01:56:20.022 --> 01:56:21.963]  And that's supposed to be the only thing that matters.
[01:56:21.963 --> 01:56:24.824]  You know, I think that's sort of the missing part about black lives matters.
[01:56:24.824 --> 01:56:26.986]  That's really only one part of the phrase.
[01:56:26.986 --> 01:56:29.447]  It's black lives matter and your life doesn't.
[01:56:29.447 --> 01:56:32.909]  Black lives matter and really nothing else matters except for that.
[01:56:32.909 --> 01:56:35.731]  And everything is supposed to orbit around that.
[01:56:35.731 --> 01:56:37.832]  Everything is supposed to orbit around them.
[01:56:38.752 --> 01:56:45.316]  Whether it's the Oscars, the Emmys, the NBA, the White House, Bank of America, I mean, you name it, that's what it's supposed to be.
[01:56:45.316 --> 01:56:46.716]  But, you know what?
[01:56:46.716 --> 01:56:48.677]  For what it's worth, it seems to be working.
[01:56:48.677 --> 01:56:54.761]  I mean, this isn't good optics for them, but of course, this isn't gonna be aired on any major network news channel.
[01:56:54.761 --> 01:56:59.463]  And of course, all the Black Lives Matter riots are minimized and downplayed by the media.
[01:56:59.463 --> 01:57:03.966]  I remember there was a big study that was done after the summer of George Floyd riots
[01:57:04.588 --> 01:57:08.110]  And it said, well, most of the BLM protests were largely peaceful.
[01:57:08.110 --> 01:57:12.793]  It was only 300, 300 demonstrations that turned violent.
[01:57:12.793 --> 01:57:13.213]  Only 300.
[01:57:13.213 --> 01:57:15.534]  I mean, think of it.
[01:57:15.534 --> 01:57:18.416]  Of course, that is understated.
[01:57:18.416 --> 01:57:19.917]  Out of how many?
[01:57:19.917 --> 01:57:22.899]  In fact, they just published a story at the Gateway Pundit.
[01:57:22.899 --> 01:57:25.540]  There was a Black Lives Matter guy that ran over.
[01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:27.782]  I think it was a Proud Boy march.
[01:57:27.782 --> 01:57:29.223]  They just ran him down in the car.
[01:57:29.223 --> 01:57:30.023]  He just got released.
[01:57:30.023 --> 01:57:32.364]  No charges.
[01:57:32.364 --> 01:57:32.865]  Yeah.
[01:57:32.865 --> 01:57:33.125]  Oh, yeah.
[01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:34.391]  And it happens all the time.
[01:57:34.391 --> 01:57:38.154]  And how about the Trump supporters killed in Portland?
[01:57:38.154 --> 01:57:41.076]  And how about the Trump supporter, I think, that was ran over?
[01:57:41.076 --> 01:57:43.018]  I think that happened in California over the summer.
[01:57:43.018 --> 01:57:44.078]  It happens all the time.
[01:57:44.078 --> 01:57:48.922]  We know there's a double standard, but people have got to start waking up and realizing what this is really about.
[01:57:48.922 --> 01:57:53.005]  I mean, at the end of the day, what this kind of Black Lives Matter stuff is really all about.
[01:57:53.005 --> 01:57:55.748]  At the end of the day, I don't think they want equality.
[01:57:55.748 --> 01:57:57.249]  I think people have to realize that.
[01:57:57.972 --> 01:58:01.841]  Black Lives Matter is not out there saying the message of Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:58:01.841 --> 01:58:04.006]  And frankly, the message of Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:58:04.006 --> 01:58:06.993]  wasn't even necessarily equality, if you look at some of his later stuff.
[01:58:07.802 --> 01:58:09.823]  What they're advocating for is revenge.
[01:58:09.823 --> 01:58:12.524]  They don't want white people and black people to be equal.
[01:58:12.524 --> 01:58:19.326]  They want white people to be put in the same position that they perceive black people as being put in a couple of generations ago.
[01:58:19.326 --> 01:58:21.307]  And they brag about it and they talk about it openly.
[01:58:21.307 --> 01:58:22.828]  So people gotta wake up and see.
[01:58:22.828 --> 01:58:24.728]  Very evil, sick stuff.
[01:58:24.728 --> 01:58:26.589]  There's nothing good about Black Lives Matter.
[01:58:26.589 --> 01:58:27.449]  It's all sick.
[01:58:27.449 --> 01:58:29.450]  One of the most evil groups in the history of America.
[01:58:29.730 --> 01:58:34.593]  Yeah, and you know, by the way, they have every right to the First Amendment, just like we do.
[01:58:34.593 --> 01:58:37.935]  But the problem is, they're not smart enough to think or ask questions.
[01:58:37.935 --> 01:58:41.537]  And so every time I ask Black Lives Matter people, oh, how much money got raised for Black Lives Matter?
[01:58:41.537 --> 01:58:42.858]  Okay, $10 billion.
[01:58:42.858 --> 01:58:45.059]  How much of that did you see?
[01:58:45.059 --> 01:58:46.120]  Oh, none.
[01:58:46.120 --> 01:58:46.260]  Huh.
[01:58:48.140 --> 01:58:51.822]  We are witnessing a perfect dichotomy of psychological warfare.
[01:58:51.822 --> 01:59:01.509]  The United Nations, the big corporations, the globalists, big tech and big pharma are all pushing the COVID as the most deadly thing in history, even though statistically, it's a very weak flu or cold.
[01:59:01.509 --> 01:59:04.771]  But if you are deficient, then you can actually die from it.
[01:59:04.771 --> 01:59:07.373]  That's why you see somebody dying in southern nursing homes.
[01:59:07.373 --> 01:59:17.700]  Meanwhile, all these top scientists and researchers and former Pfizer head medical officers have come out and said that the COVID-19 vaccine, especially the mRNA ones, are basically
[01:59:18.100 --> 01:59:18.280]  I'm good.
[01:59:55.051 --> 02:00:06.973]  So the bitch that stole Christmas, Nancy Pelosi, has said she is going to pull Trump out of the White House by his hair and his hands and his feet.
[02:00:06.973 --> 02:00:08.534]  This woman needs to be
[02:00:22.520 --> 02:00:33.343]  This woman needs to be put into a mental institution, which of course would be her excuse to avoid jail, but we live in an absolute crazy time right now.
[02:00:33.343 --> 02:00:38.825]  Federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York are working to seize Rudy Giuliani's emails.
[02:00:39.525 --> 02:00:45.370]  Folks, we don't get much into this because it's honestly a bunch of schadenfreude, behind-the-scenes stuff.
[02:00:45.370 --> 02:00:54.777]  In fact, most of the Civil War happening, at least at a true activity level, is actually happening in New York and not Washington, D.C.
[02:00:55.598 --> 02:01:13.889]  It's behind the scenes in New York with corrupt judges and the Southern District of New York and then actual police officers and investigators who know all the crimes that have been going through New York, whether it's the Clintons or the Southern District of New York and their politicization.
[02:01:13.889 --> 02:01:16.811]  So we're going to have much more of this coming up here on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:01:16.811 --> 02:01:19.553]  We have one segment left with Nick Fuentes.
[02:01:20.339 --> 02:01:23.460]  The host of America First, no one else.
[02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:24.360]  Only Nick Fuentes.
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:27.981]  Other people will try to pretend that that's their show title.
[02:01:27.981 --> 02:01:28.761]  It's not.
[02:01:28.761 --> 02:01:30.342]  They stole it from him.
[02:01:30.342 --> 02:01:31.142]  We know who you are.
[02:01:31.142 --> 02:01:32.903]  Speeched well.
[02:01:32.903 --> 02:01:34.643]  So Nick, last segment with you here.
[02:01:34.643 --> 02:01:35.523]  What's on your mind?
[02:01:35.523 --> 02:01:37.604]  What's coming up on America First next?
[02:01:39.093 --> 02:01:42.314]  Well, we're getting ready to go out back to Washington, D.C.
[02:01:42.314 --> 02:01:45.975]  on January 6th when the Electoral College votes are counted.
[02:01:45.975 --> 02:01:47.916]  I mean, we're getting ready for Christmas, of course.
[02:01:47.916 --> 02:02:00.160]  Christmas coming up this week, and I'll be taking a little bit of a break because, you know, I've been flying around with InfoWars for the past five or six weeks doing Stop the Steal in Atlanta, Phoenix, D.C., everywhere else.
[02:02:00.160 --> 02:02:05.462]  But I'm going to take a short break for Christmas, New Year's Eve, and then I'm going to come back January 6th.
[02:02:05.462 --> 02:02:07.803]  There's going to be a big march on the Capitol.
[02:02:08.499 --> 02:02:10.360]  And that is when they're going to be counting the votes.
[02:02:10.360 --> 02:02:15.641]  It's going to be a joint session of Congress, House and the Senate, Vice President counts the votes.
[02:02:15.641 --> 02:02:26.485]  And we're holding out hope that there's going to be an objection from a senator and a House representative and that that might slow down the process of Biden becoming the president-elect or maybe overturn the result.
[02:02:26.485 --> 02:02:28.366]  I'm honestly not optimistic about it.
[02:02:28.906 --> 02:02:41.235]  I think what's going to happen in January is, with a big demonstration on the 6th and a big demonstration on the 20th with the inauguration, I think what we're going to do is basically set the tone for the next four years.
[02:02:41.235 --> 02:02:49.802]  Which is to say, whether or not Trump is elected, if Biden gets in and he's inaugurated, we're not going to accept him as the legitimate president.
[02:02:49.802 --> 02:02:51.783]  And that's got to set the tone.
[02:02:51.783 --> 02:02:55.006]  January 6th and January 20th, we've got to come back to D.C.
[02:02:56.059 --> 02:02:57.420]  Occupy the Capitol.
[02:02:57.420 --> 02:03:02.845]  And this is going to communicate, I think, to the country and to the establishment that Trump supporters are not going away.
[02:03:02.845 --> 02:03:04.106]  You know, we're certainly not done.
[02:03:04.106 --> 02:03:06.208]  We're not done with 2020.
[02:03:06.208 --> 02:03:09.031]  And we're only getting angrier and angrier.
[02:03:09.031 --> 02:03:12.374]  And pretty soon that's going to metastasize in ways that the elites don't like.
[02:03:13.075 --> 02:03:17.820]  You know, like I went viral last week or a couple weeks ago for saying, destroy the GOP.
[02:03:17.820 --> 02:03:18.841]  Like that's going to happen.
[02:03:18.841 --> 02:03:20.082]  We're going to take the fight now.
[02:03:20.082 --> 02:03:26.729]  And I think that's going to be the future is looking past the election fraud and looking past the events of the 2020 election.
[02:03:26.729 --> 02:03:27.810]  It's going to be looking forward to 2022.
[02:03:29.111 --> 02:03:46.741]  And honestly, making a list of every last Republican that voted for this terrible COVID stimulus bill, that votes for eliminating the cap on foreign visas, that votes for that terrible bill by Mike Lee, votes for Hong Kong, temporary protective status, and that didn't protect President Trump in this election, we've got to get them out of office.
[02:03:46.741 --> 02:03:48.882]  We've got to get every last one of them out of office.
[02:03:48.882 --> 02:03:50.883]  We've got to make them lose their primaries.
[02:03:50.883 --> 02:03:58.307]  And we've got to get people that are America First, people that are of and from the country, into the White House, into the Congress, into the Senate.
[02:03:58.959 --> 02:04:01.341]  Into places where they can actually make the decisions.
[02:04:01.341 --> 02:04:02.982]  That, to me, is the future.
[02:04:02.982 --> 02:04:05.244]  That's all I've been thinking about for the past five weeks.
[02:04:05.244 --> 02:04:10.608]  You know, because for a long time, I thought the endgame would be getting America first people in government.
[02:04:10.608 --> 02:04:17.514]  But since this election fraud, that timeline has just accelerated rapidly because the need has never been greater.
[02:04:17.514 --> 02:04:19.436]  There's a great window of opportunity right now.
[02:04:19.436 --> 02:04:21.197]  And basically, that's what I'm thinking about.
[02:04:21.197 --> 02:04:23.399]  So we have to take the Trump revolution.
[02:04:23.399 --> 02:04:24.460]  We've got to make it permanent.
[02:04:24.460 --> 02:04:25.741]  We've got to institutionalize it.
[02:04:26.221 --> 02:04:27.182]  It's not over now.
[02:04:27.182 --> 02:04:29.023]  In some ways, it's only really just beginning.
[02:04:29.023 --> 02:04:31.104]  So that's what I've been up to lately.
[02:04:31.104 --> 02:04:37.508]  And if President Trump does leave the White House on January 21st, he better do something to make sure they can't steal elections again.
[02:04:37.508 --> 02:04:43.251]  Otherwise, we'll never have any elections and all those hopes will be kaput, in my view.
[02:04:43.251 --> 02:04:45.833]  Here's what I'm afraid of.
[02:04:45.833 --> 02:04:50.476]  On January 6th, I do believe there'll probably be about another million people in D.C.
[02:04:50.476 --> 02:04:55.299]  and we will surround the Capitol building there and it'll be totally epic.
[02:04:56.109 --> 02:05:02.471]  But what I think they're going to do is, and this is just what their game plan has been the whole time, is they're just going to continue to run out the clock.
[02:05:02.471 --> 02:05:08.893]  So they'll find a way to balk on the 6th, they'll find a way to carry this down the road, because here's the deal.
[02:05:08.893 --> 02:05:15.675]  They don't want to make an announcement that, nope, we're letting Biden steal this from you, when there's a million people surrounding the Capitol building.
[02:05:16.684 --> 02:05:25.950]  I mean, I'm not predicting that anything is going to happen, but let's just say, you know, you're throwing... I don't even know really what you're doing there.
[02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:27.431]  I mean, you're just asking for trouble.
[02:05:27.431 --> 02:05:29.052]  I mean, you saw what happened in Oregon.
[02:05:29.052 --> 02:05:34.395]  I'm not predicting that would happen, but there's a chance that would happen at the state capitol.
[02:05:34.835 --> 02:05:42.318]  Now, I've already been arrested multiple times there, so, you know, I don't even know if I'm allowed on the grounds, but maybe I join in on something like that.
[02:05:42.318 --> 02:05:47.701]  I'd need about 500 people in case they try to come arrest me and throw me away, but this is what I'm afraid of.
[02:05:47.701 --> 02:05:56.704]  I'm afraid the big day is going to be the inauguration day or the day before the inauguration or that week, because that's when they're going to have to make the final decision.
[02:05:56.704 --> 02:05:59.926]  I think they're going to push this off until the final seconds
[02:06:00.586 --> 02:06:11.901]  And I think Trump is aware of this too, and that's when Trump either decides, I'm hitting the buzzer beater, I'm hitting the walk-off home run, I'm having the final possession here, or they're going to get away with the steal.
[02:06:11.901 --> 02:06:13.042]  That's how I see this going.
[02:06:13.042 --> 02:06:14.785]  Final prediction from Nick Fuentes.
[02:06:16.301 --> 02:06:17.562]  Yeah, I think that's about right.
[02:06:17.562 --> 02:06:26.610]  I think that on January 6th, I'm not confident that our Republican representatives are going to do anything to keep Trump in office, as much as they might be talking about that.
[02:06:26.610 --> 02:06:29.373]  I think that'll be shut down pretty quickly in the Senate.
[02:06:29.373 --> 02:06:32.055]  I think that ultimately Biden is going to be inaugurated.
[02:06:32.055 --> 02:06:34.177]  I basically think it's over, unfortunately.
[02:06:34.697 --> 02:06:36.317]  And we're going to fight through the finish line.
[02:06:36.317 --> 02:06:37.298]  That doesn't mean I'm done.
[02:06:37.298 --> 02:06:38.578]  I'm still going out to D.C.
[02:06:38.578 --> 02:06:47.020]  on the 6th, and I'm going to keep talking about it all the way through the 20th, everything that we could do, our remaining options and things like that, because, you know, it's not resolved.
[02:06:47.020 --> 02:06:48.000]  It's not written.
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.081]  And miracles have happened before.
[02:06:50.081 --> 02:06:53.822]  Donald Trump is the luckiest man in the world, one of the smartest men in the world.
[02:06:53.822 --> 02:06:56.442]  If anybody could pull it off, honest to God, it's him.
[02:06:56.442 --> 02:07:03.804]  So I'm not discounting him completely, but I have virtually zero confidence that the Republican Party is going to swoop in and save him.
[02:07:04.764 --> 02:07:14.051]  Unfortunately, he's got people surrounding him from his campaign from his White House and the administration that are just not giving him good advice and people that are just outright sabotaging him.
[02:07:14.051 --> 02:07:16.813]  So he's really in a very difficult situation.
[02:07:16.813 --> 02:07:21.216]  I think ultimately that Biden will probably be inaugurated without without a major incident.
[02:07:21.943 --> 02:07:25.005]  And it's going to be very, very important that we keep the momentum going.
[02:07:25.005 --> 02:07:31.848]  I mean, that's really the biggest thing, because it cannot be overstated what a big deal this was, what a giant fraud this was.
[02:07:31.848 --> 02:07:32.949]  Everybody knows it.
[02:07:32.949 --> 02:07:37.411]  The scope and the scale of this fraud, it's never been greater in the history of America.
[02:07:37.411 --> 02:07:41.213]  And what this effectively does is it nullifies all future elections.
[02:07:41.213 --> 02:07:43.835]  It destroys our confidence in the entire system.
[02:07:43.835 --> 02:07:47.957]  It destroys the legitimacy upon which the system's authority rests.
[02:07:47.957 --> 02:07:49.858]  This is a really big deal.
[02:07:49.858 --> 02:07:51.259]  And people need to internalize that.
[02:07:52.020 --> 02:07:53.161]  And they need to act like that.
[02:07:53.161 --> 02:07:59.266]  And we need to do something about that that doesn't just entail getting really mad about it online and complaining about it.
[02:07:59.266 --> 02:08:00.907]  We've got to actually do something about it.
[02:08:00.907 --> 02:08:14.979]  And I really believe there's an opening in the next couple of years to do what the Tea Party couldn't do, to do what the Buchanan Brigades couldn't do, and that is to retake the GOP and make it a populist nationalist party that represents the will of the traditional American nation.
[02:08:15.479 --> 02:08:18.701]  I think as far as our political options go, that's it.
[02:08:18.701 --> 02:08:23.903]  And if that doesn't work, I think we will have exhausted our so-called political options.
[02:08:23.903 --> 02:08:29.185]  I don't want to get too much into what happens after that, but I think people can imagine we're getting to a breaking point here.
[02:08:29.185 --> 02:08:33.087]  We're getting to this collision course where the masses of people in this country
[02:08:33.803 --> 02:08:35.124]  We're not being listened to.
[02:08:35.124 --> 02:08:36.485]  Our votes don't count.
[02:08:36.485 --> 02:08:37.947]  We're being banned from social media.
[02:08:37.947 --> 02:08:40.008]  We're being denied a seat at the table.
[02:08:40.008 --> 02:08:42.671]  And at a certain point, something's got to give there.
[02:08:42.671 --> 02:08:45.793]  And, you know, you could use your imagination about what that means.
[02:08:45.793 --> 02:08:47.495]  That's how our country was founded.
[02:08:47.495 --> 02:08:51.118]  But I think that we're sort of nearing the end of our political options.
[02:08:51.118 --> 02:08:53.380]  You know, people ask me all the time, is it too late?
[02:08:54.013 --> 02:08:55.654]  I think it was too late 20 years ago.
[02:08:55.654 --> 02:08:56.815]  It was too late yesterday.
[02:08:56.815 --> 02:09:02.799]  And we're sort of exhausting our final, last-ditch, sort of miraculous options.
[02:09:02.799 --> 02:09:08.383]  Trump, I mean, by any count, the Trump presidency should not have happened.
[02:09:08.383 --> 02:09:09.563]  It went against the odds.
[02:09:09.563 --> 02:09:11.985]  There's no reason it should have happened, and yet it did.
[02:09:11.985 --> 02:09:13.666]  And it bought us a little bit more time.
[02:09:13.666 --> 02:09:16.848]  But, I mean, it probably should have been over four years ago.
[02:09:16.848 --> 02:09:18.009]  We have a little bit more time.
[02:09:18.009 --> 02:09:19.210]  We have a few more options.
[02:09:20.165 --> 02:09:22.546]  You know, I think people have an idea of where things are headed.
[02:09:22.546 --> 02:09:29.729]  People can feel it in their bones that this country is not in a good place and something's got to give, something's got to break here.
[02:09:29.729 --> 02:09:33.110]  But I can tell you something, the American people aren't going to go down without a fight.
[02:09:33.527 --> 02:09:38.030]  There's an old saying around here called liberty or death.
[02:09:38.030 --> 02:09:41.532]  Nick Fuentes, host of America First, thank you for joining us today.
[02:09:41.532 --> 02:09:44.273]  We will see you in D.C.
[02:09:44.273 --> 02:09:45.534]  on January 6th.
[02:09:45.534 --> 02:09:46.675]  It's sure to be epic.
[02:09:46.675 --> 02:09:51.197]  Introducing Infowars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[02:09:51.197 --> 02:09:53.759]  This is taken under the tongue.
[02:09:53.759 --> 02:09:54.900]  It is pure turmeric.
[02:09:55.931 --> 02:10:05.135]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate tumeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[02:10:05.135 --> 02:10:10.978]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[02:10:10.978 --> 02:10:13.139]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[02:10:13.599 --> 02:10:16.501]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[02:10:16.501 --> 02:10:18.663]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[02:10:18.663 --> 02:10:20.784]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[02:10:20.784 --> 02:10:22.966]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[02:10:22.966 --> 02:10:24.327]  Some like bodies better.
[02:10:24.327 --> 02:10:28.470]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[02:10:28.470 --> 02:10:29.651]  And they fund the InfoWare.

[02:11:42.109 --> 02:11:43.830]  Without your support, we couldn't do any of it.
[02:11:49.691 --> 02:12:02.678]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:02.678 --> 02:12:07.040]  You are listening to an InfoWars.com Frontline Report.
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:11.663]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:12:11.663 --> 02:12:15.325]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:12:15.325 --> 02:12:17.406]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I am going to
[02:12:20.003 --> 02:12:27.609]  Cover all the news in the next three segments before Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[02:12:27.609 --> 02:12:35.815]  I'm then going to get ready and get into the War Room studio to host the War Room from 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:12:35.815 --> 02:12:38.477]  Central, my normal host duties here.
[02:12:38.477 --> 02:12:45.603]  I'm gonna dedicate, in fact, I don't know the schedule, we may have a guest or two, but I'm gonna dedicate the entire War Room
[02:12:46.795 --> 02:12:51.098]  Outside of any guests we may have scheduled, to your phone calls.
[02:12:51.098 --> 02:12:58.922]  We've been getting great phone calls, specifically during our new morning broadcast, the American Journal.
[02:12:58.922 --> 02:13:01.604]  Very topic, phone call oriented.
[02:13:01.604 --> 02:13:03.965]  We take as many calls as we can on that morning show.
[02:13:03.965 --> 02:13:07.928]  Harrison Smith will be the normal in-studio host for that.
[02:13:09.255 --> 02:13:16.980]  And we'll really start getting back into the flow of things probably, honestly probably after New Year's, but maybe after Christmas.
[02:13:16.980 --> 02:13:19.241]  And so we'll get more into the flow here.
[02:13:19.241 --> 02:13:25.045]  We have been begging Alex to get away just to refresh the batteries.
[02:13:25.045 --> 02:13:28.988]  So that's why you're not hearing from him today and perhaps maybe not tomorrow.
[02:13:28.988 --> 02:13:34.231]  Of course he is buzzing around here half the time anyway.
[02:13:34.231 --> 02:13:35.992]  That's just how he operates.
[02:13:38.086 --> 02:13:44.430]  But so if you're chomping at the bit to call into the AJ Show today, I will be taking calls for the entire war room.
[02:13:44.430 --> 02:13:46.751]  In fact, guys, is there anybody on the war room schedule today?
[02:13:46.751 --> 02:13:56.477]  They're gonna check that for me so that we can give a little programming notice here.
[02:13:56.477 --> 02:13:59.118]  Okay, so what time would that be?
[02:13:59.118 --> 02:14:05.942]  So we may have a guest at four, not confirmed, but that means that I can, for the most part, dedicate the entire war room to your phone calls.
[02:14:05.942 --> 02:14:06.963]  So that's what's gonna happen today.
[02:14:08.165 --> 02:14:16.708]  Before I get back into this news... Sorry, I'm just looking at all the numbers and all of our money being stolen.
[02:14:16.708 --> 02:14:19.709]  It's nice, isn't it?
[02:14:19.709 --> 02:14:30.714]  Before we get back into that, ladies and gentlemen, InfoWarsStore.com has the Premier Vitamin D Supplement.
[02:14:30.714 --> 02:14:33.254]  It's Winter Sun Plus.
[02:14:33.254 --> 02:14:34.375]  We keep it right here.
[02:14:35.407 --> 02:14:37.069]  Especially during the winter time.
[02:14:37.069 --> 02:14:40.413]  Right here, desk side.
[02:14:40.413 --> 02:14:49.104]  So that I can receive the benefits of the premier vitamin D supplement on the market.
[02:14:49.104 --> 02:14:52.649]  That is Winter Sun Plus.
[02:14:52.649 --> 02:14:53.870]  Back in stock.
[02:14:54.730 --> 02:15:03.833]  So, if you were looking for Winter Sun Plus at InfoWarsStore.com, last couple of weeks or so, it's been sold out.
[02:15:03.833 --> 02:15:16.598]  That's because, whether people like InfoWars or not, they know that this is the best vitamin D supplement on the market, so they scoop up as much as possible ahead of winter, so we were out of stock for a while.
[02:15:16.598 --> 02:15:19.079]  We're back in stock.
[02:15:19.079 --> 02:15:22.040]  Winter Sun Plus, back in stock.
[02:15:23.768 --> 02:15:27.411]  50% off at InfowarsStore.com.
[02:15:27.411 --> 02:15:29.332]  And just look at the reviews.
[02:15:29.332 --> 02:15:34.616]  It has a 4.9 star review on the nearly 1,000 reviews.
[02:15:34.616 --> 02:15:37.438]  And by the way, this is our second Wintersun product.
[02:15:37.438 --> 02:15:39.180]  We had Wintersun, now it's Wintersun Plus.
[02:15:39.180 --> 02:15:41.201]  It's been revamped, reformulated.
[02:15:41.201 --> 02:15:45.664]  So these are just the second round of reviews, not even overall for this supplement.
[02:15:45.664 --> 02:15:50.308]  It's been around for a while, but the revamped supplement, 97% would recommend to a friend.
[02:15:51.088 --> 02:15:54.590]  And when you see the 4.9 star review there, folks, that's basically 5 stars.
[02:15:54.590 --> 02:15:59.072]  I mean, if you get one rating, you have hundreds of ratings there.
[02:15:59.072 --> 02:16:04.454]  If you get one rating that's a 4 star, you can basically never get to a full 5 star ever again.
[02:16:04.454 --> 02:16:05.915]  That's just how the system works.
[02:16:05.915 --> 02:16:08.216]  So that's a 5 star rating.
[02:16:08.216 --> 02:16:09.696]  4.9, that's as good as it gets.
[02:16:09.696 --> 02:16:13.318]  Winter Sun Plus Ultra Vitamin D Supplement.
[02:16:14.551 --> 02:16:29.816]  The premier vitamin D supplement, Wintersun Plus, InfoWarsStore.com, 50% off, 50% off at InfoWarsStore.com right now.
[02:16:29.816 --> 02:16:37.419]  Let's see, Hunter Biden committing more crimes, making millions of dollars in China, well, you know.
[02:16:37.419 --> 02:16:41.200]  Nothing to see there, I'm sure.
[02:16:43.098 --> 02:16:46.461]  Eric Swalwell.
[02:16:46.461 --> 02:16:50.945]  Eric the Pool Boy Swalwell.
[02:16:50.945 --> 02:16:55.009]  Eric the Fart Boy Swalwell.
[02:16:55.009 --> 02:16:57.291]  Headline from National File.
[02:16:57.291 --> 02:17:01.875]  Intel briefing reveals Eric Swalwell has no place on House Intelligence Committee.
[02:17:01.875 --> 02:17:04.458]  Yeah, he's a Chinese spy.
[02:17:05.868 --> 02:17:11.813]  And, you know, if I recall correctly, Feinstein runs the Senate Intel Committee.
[02:17:11.813 --> 02:17:12.754]  I could be wrong about that.
[02:17:12.754 --> 02:17:17.737]  Guys, see if Feinstein is on some sort of intelligence or maybe oversight committee.
[02:17:17.737 --> 02:17:25.504]  So you have Chinese spies running our intelligence committees in Congress.
[02:17:25.504 --> 02:17:27.445]  Nice.
[02:17:27.445 --> 02:17:28.686]  Nice, Democrats.
[02:17:28.686 --> 02:17:29.407]  You idiots.
[02:17:31.451 --> 02:17:33.353]  You idiots!
[02:17:33.353 --> 02:17:36.635]  And I'm not talking about Feinstein and Swalwell.
[02:17:36.635 --> 02:17:37.856]  They're smart!
[02:17:37.856 --> 02:17:40.038]  They like money!
[02:17:40.038 --> 02:17:41.219]  So they sold out.
[02:17:41.219 --> 02:17:42.600]  Or maybe Swalwell's not that smart.
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:46.303]  Didn't even realize he was being honey-potted.
[02:17:46.303 --> 02:17:47.004]  He is an idiot.
[02:17:47.004 --> 02:17:48.965]  He looks like an idiot.
[02:17:48.965 --> 02:17:51.047]  He acts like an idiot.
[02:17:51.047 --> 02:17:57.032]  So... You had a Chinese... Compromised...
[02:17:58.954 --> 02:18:12.264]  Senate Intelligence Committee member Dianne Feinstein, and you had a Chinese compromised House Intelligence Committee member compromised by China.
[02:18:12.264 --> 02:18:16.927]  But hey guys, look out for Russia!
[02:18:16.927 --> 02:18:19.929]  Russia's coming to get ya!
[02:18:19.929 --> 02:18:22.011]  That's exactly what China would want you to think.
[02:18:23.032 --> 02:18:24.613]  Yeah, look over here!
[02:18:24.613 --> 02:18:25.594]  Ooh, look at the birdie!
[02:18:25.594 --> 02:18:26.755]  Look at the birdie!
[02:18:26.755 --> 02:18:30.259]  Meanwhile, China is buying up everything.
[02:18:30.259 --> 02:18:31.360]  All the minerals.
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:32.461]  All the gold.
[02:18:32.461 --> 02:18:38.726]  Building islands turned into military bases in the South China Sea, which is not even the South China Sea.
[02:18:38.726 --> 02:18:39.367]  They're just claiming it!
[02:18:40.563 --> 02:18:41.744]  I just had a very sad vision.
[02:19:10.888 --> 02:19:31.799]  Get Trump back in the White House, and maybe even if we do, I hate this, but I mean, we're basically going to have to become the activist party that the left pretends to be.
[02:19:31.799 --> 02:19:36.902]  Because when you have
[02:19:38.326 --> 02:19:47.913]  Apple and Nike and Microsoft and the rest of them that have their slave labor camps in China.
[02:19:47.913 --> 02:19:51.275]  I mean, this is just a joke.
[02:19:51.275 --> 02:19:57.860]  And you know, that's why, you know, intellectually I can do politics all day long here and we can talk about the corruption and ways to fix it.
[02:20:03.866 --> 02:20:11.733]  How do you even juxtapose that with literal slaves in China that make all of our goods?
[02:20:11.733 --> 02:20:21.861]  How do you juxtapose that with literal pedophile networks kidnapping and raping and torturing and murdering children?
[02:20:21.861 --> 02:20:25.124]  So again, I can talk about politics all day long, but
[02:20:26.581 --> 02:20:32.645]  When you get those flashes, when you go down that path again, because you know it's there, it's just like, what are we doing here, man?
[02:20:32.645 --> 02:20:34.906]  But you know, you look at a Swalwell.
[02:20:34.906 --> 02:20:36.867]  You look at a Nadler.
[02:20:36.867 --> 02:20:38.028]  You look at a Dennis Hastert.
[02:20:39.104 --> 02:20:40.665]  You know, okay.
[02:20:40.665 --> 02:20:42.325]  You start to see what's going on.
[02:20:42.325 --> 02:20:44.646]  These are blackmailed people, folks.
[02:20:44.646 --> 02:20:45.326]  It's not good.
[02:20:45.326 --> 02:20:49.388]  Webster's Dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[02:20:49.388 --> 02:20:51.809]  Other dictionaries have similar ones.
[02:20:51.809 --> 02:20:58.672]  Terrorism is the threat of force, or actually carrying out force, for a political or financial reason.
[02:20:59.432 --> 02:21:03.334]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[02:21:03.334 --> 02:21:06.795]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[02:21:06.795 --> 02:21:09.236]  You see the headlines from CNN, ABC News.
[02:21:09.236 --> 02:21:11.637]  Doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[02:21:11.637 --> 02:21:14.198]  COVID more devastating than you could ever imagine.
[02:21:14.198 --> 02:21:15.059]  They told us that
[02:21:15.899 --> 02:21:19.841]  Two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago, within three months.
[02:21:19.841 --> 02:21:21.381]  Okay?
[02:21:21.381 --> 02:21:25.963]  It's a quarter million if you count all of the people that died of other things.
[02:21:25.963 --> 02:21:28.264]  We're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[02:21:28.264 --> 02:21:29.085]  These are real numbers.
[02:21:29.085 --> 02:21:30.345]  These are real facts.
[02:21:30.345 --> 02:21:38.248]  This is the chicken little event where we all run in our houses, never come out, and are taught we're not essential, while the big box stores and Amazon take over the planet.
[02:21:38.248 --> 02:21:39.029]  Rebuke it.
[02:21:39.029 --> 02:21:40.209]  Stand up against it.
[02:21:40.209 --> 02:21:41.970]  This is slavery.
[02:21:41.970 --> 02:21:44.191]  It is not something you can put up with and survive.
[02:21:45.700 --> 02:21:48.081]  The post-industrial world.
[02:21:48.081 --> 02:21:57.346]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[02:21:57.346 --> 02:22:01.868]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post-industrial world.
[02:22:01.868 --> 02:22:08.811]  Klaus Schwab of the Davos Group, Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, they're all on record saying the Great Reset is Agenda 2030.
[02:22:10.552 --> 02:22:13.575]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[02:22:13.575 --> 02:22:16.718]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[02:22:16.718 --> 02:22:18.680]  It is making the population poor.
[02:22:18.680 --> 02:22:24.585]  By design, so we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family.
[02:22:24.585 --> 02:22:27.888]  They are destroying civilization, rebuilding, and they're dystopic.
[02:22:28.789 --> 02:22:32.914]  The globalists are taking control of the entire human genome.
[02:22:49.071 --> 02:22:51.653]  They are forcing mutations.
[02:22:51.653 --> 02:22:55.255]  This is forced evolution, or de-evolution.
[02:22:55.255 --> 02:23:03.800]  When you look at all the major research, all the major programs they're carrying out, they are not to produce people that are smarter, or folks that live longer, or are more moral.
[02:23:03.800 --> 02:23:04.420]  No.
[02:23:04.420 --> 02:23:06.961]  It's turning humanity into a commodity.
[02:23:06.961 --> 02:23:14.486]  Now we see some propaganda, like Communist China bragging, Hey, we've done mRNA vaccines to make our soldiers supermen!
[02:23:14.486 --> 02:23:17.888]  That's a way to make it sexy that, hey, we're experimenting on our troops!
[02:23:18.528 --> 02:23:24.553]  We'll say the things that happened to our troops, and thousands and thousands have died each time they tried a new experimental vaccine.
[02:23:24.553 --> 02:23:29.637]  And I'm talking to high-level folks inside the federal government and the State of Texas Health Department.
[02:23:29.637 --> 02:23:32.639]  They say, Alex, we know it hurts a lot of people, but it's for a greater good.
[02:23:32.639 --> 02:23:34.160]  But that's not even true.
[02:23:34.160 --> 02:23:38.624]  And it violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, federal and state law.
[02:23:38.624 --> 02:23:41.085]  This is violence being carried out against this biomedical tyranny.
[02:23:41.085 --> 02:23:44.028]  And we have a right to resist it with any means necessary.
[02:23:47.958 --> 02:23:56.445]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:56.445 --> 02:24:02.129]  This country's in big trouble.
[02:24:20.837 --> 02:24:29.724]  And I just hope that President Trump and his team realizes that there is no coming back from this.
[02:24:29.724 --> 02:24:38.832]  If they let this steal happen, forget about 2024, forget about whatever grandiose plans you have, it's done.
[02:24:38.832 --> 02:24:40.433]  It's done.
[02:24:40.433 --> 02:24:41.554]  Stick a fork in us, man.
[02:24:41.554 --> 02:24:45.477]  We're as gone as Venezuela at that point.
[02:24:45.477 --> 02:24:48.280]  We are in the grips of the Chinese Communists.
[02:24:49.329 --> 02:24:50.690]  We have slave labor, by the way.
[02:24:50.690 --> 02:24:52.030]  So, get ready.
[02:24:52.030 --> 02:24:54.091]  You'll be broke, but don't worry.
[02:24:54.091 --> 02:24:58.173]  China will build plenty of slave camps for you to work for Apple in.
[02:24:58.173 --> 02:25:01.594]  And it'll be great, and you'll love it.
[02:25:01.594 --> 02:25:06.356]  And so that's where we're at right now.
[02:25:06.356 --> 02:25:09.697]  I've got other news that I want to get to here in the last two segments.
[02:25:09.697 --> 02:25:15.700]  Again, I'm going to be taking nothing but your phone calls today on The War Room from 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:25:15.700 --> 02:25:16.540]  Central.
[02:25:16.540 --> 02:25:18.441]  Paul Joseph Watson set to take over here in 30 minutes.
[02:25:20.020 --> 02:25:23.543]  But I don't know.
[02:25:23.543 --> 02:25:40.178]  When I see this stimulus bill and I see people fighting to get Trump back in the White House when he won the election in record fashion, it's just, it's just joke level, man.
[02:25:40.178 --> 02:25:43.962]  So what do you do?
[02:25:43.962 --> 02:25:46.224]  You continue to fight that political fight or do you
[02:25:48.137 --> 02:26:14.557]  Go back to the bigger issues, which is the fact that China has slave labor that makes all of our goods, now owns our government, and the fact that there is a deeply embedded pedophile network in DC and Silicon Valley.
[02:26:14.557 --> 02:26:14.797]  So,
[02:26:17.153 --> 02:26:21.136]  It's just really intense, man.
[02:26:21.136 --> 02:26:30.063]  And just like they stole the election right in front of our face, they traffic children right in front of our face and brag about it.
[02:26:30.063 --> 02:26:34.166]  In their Disney movies with all their symbology.
[02:26:34.166 --> 02:26:37.829]  On the social media networks with all their keywords and symbology.
[02:26:37.829 --> 02:26:44.274]  DC with blackmailed pedophiles and the Dennis Hasterts of the world.
[02:26:53.258 --> 02:27:02.586]  So, hopefully President Trump wants to do the right thing and uh... I mean, it's just... There's no evidence of voter fraud?
[02:27:02.586 --> 02:27:03.607]  Oh, okay.
[02:27:03.607 --> 02:27:05.969]  There's no evidence of pedophile networks?
[02:27:05.969 --> 02:27:07.270]  Oh, okay.
[02:27:07.270 --> 02:27:09.853]  Mm-hmm.
[02:27:09.853 --> 02:27:10.233]  Mm-hmm.
[02:27:11.897 --> 02:27:13.798]  All right, I'm going to try to get back to focus on this news.
[02:27:13.798 --> 02:27:17.001]  It's just very dystopian what's happening here.
[02:27:17.001 --> 02:27:20.483]  Anti-lockdown protesters kick in door at Oregon Statehouse.
[02:27:20.483 --> 02:27:22.745]  Now again, I was all fired up about this yesterday.
[02:27:22.745 --> 02:27:24.226]  Here's the thing.
[02:27:24.226 --> 02:27:26.467]  It's just about exposing the double standard.
[02:27:26.467 --> 02:27:28.569]  I'm not saying you go occupy state buildings.
[02:27:28.569 --> 02:27:37.415]  I'm saying you go in there and you either show the double standard, which is the left gets to riot and protest and loot and burn however the hell they want, but you have an American flag.
[02:27:37.415 --> 02:27:38.756]  You get nothing.
[02:27:41.109 --> 02:27:50.975]  All you do is you go in there and you just make a statement and you say, look, we're going to come here and take the Capitol building over every day until you reopen our economy.
[02:27:50.975 --> 02:27:52.476]  But see, I guess that'd be going to the wrong place.
[02:27:52.476 --> 02:27:58.440]  You need to go to the Chinese government to beg for our country to be reopened, apparently.
[02:27:58.440 --> 02:28:06.285]  So yeah, I understand why conservatives and Republicans say that this is bad optics and not to do this, but I'm telling you that this is inevitable.
[02:28:09.079 --> 02:28:19.586]  So, I'm not encouraging this behavior, but I understand it, and I'm not discouraging it either.
[02:28:19.586 --> 02:28:25.310]  Because it's inevitable, and what are people to do when their entire livelihood has been destroyed?
[02:28:25.310 --> 02:28:32.534]  And then they kick rocks at us with this stimulus bill.
[02:28:32.534 --> 02:28:34.135]  Ugh.
[02:28:34.135 --> 02:28:34.836]  Gets even worse.
[02:28:36.693 --> 02:28:45.195]  Arizona Charter School got a PPP loan, and they gave $10 million to a shareholder.
[02:28:45.195 --> 02:28:46.035]  That's nice, isn't it?
[02:28:46.035 --> 02:28:54.496]  Primavera Online Charter School, like many businesses this spring, sought help from the Federal Paycheck Protection Program to weather the economic disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic.
[02:28:54.496 --> 02:28:56.317]  Except it was not a pandemic.
[02:28:56.317 --> 02:28:59.257]  It was a government sabotage.
[02:28:59.257 --> 02:29:03.858]  A Chinese-run economic warfare exercise.
[02:29:05.572 --> 02:29:16.518]  The school received a loan of nearly $2.2 million, the largest forgivable loan among the 132 Arizona charter schools that obtained them.
[02:29:16.518 --> 02:29:21.722]  But Primavera's loan appears to have been more of a bonus than a lifeline.
[02:29:21.722 --> 02:29:29.206]  The school, which like all Arizona public schools, didn't lose state funding because of the pandemic, ended its fiscal year on June 30th with $8.8 million in the bank.
[02:29:31.800 --> 02:29:39.086]  The school also shipped $10 million to its shareholder, StrongMind.
[02:29:39.086 --> 02:29:40.247]  Hmm.
[02:29:40.247 --> 02:29:45.931]  An affiliated company owned by Primavera's founder and former CEO, Damian Creamer.
[02:29:45.931 --> 02:29:47.533]  Hmm.
[02:29:47.533 --> 02:29:49.634]  There's just some theft of your money.
[02:29:49.634 --> 02:29:51.236]  Just like that.
[02:29:51.236 --> 02:29:51.796]  Isn't that nice?
[02:29:51.796 --> 02:29:53.978]  You just watch people just steal your money.
[02:30:00.175 --> 02:30:01.916]  Oh man, that's good, isn't it?
[02:30:01.916 --> 02:30:03.657]  That's nice.
[02:30:03.657 --> 02:30:05.859]  That's real nice.
[02:30:05.859 --> 02:30:08.220]  Peter Navarro, story in Newsmax.
[02:30:08.220 --> 02:30:15.284]  I've seen the Deep State, I've looked them in the eye, and it basically just gets into everything that we've been talking about today.
[02:30:15.284 --> 02:30:21.428]  How Trump's been overrun and sabotaged, and if we don't get Trump back in the White House, it's over.
[02:30:21.428 --> 02:30:25.970]  And in a way, it's already over, because we've even gotten this far.
[02:30:25.970 --> 02:30:28.372]  The Twitter, the commander in tweet
[02:30:30.092 --> 02:30:35.834]  The commander in tweet, Donald Trump, says the Democrats dumped hundreds of thousands of ballots in the swing states late in the evening.
[02:30:35.834 --> 02:30:37.214]  It was a rigged election.
[02:30:37.214 --> 02:30:39.255]  Thanks, President!
[02:30:39.255 --> 02:30:40.636]  Maybe arrest somebody, I don't know.
[02:30:40.636 --> 02:30:41.376]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:30:41.376 --> 02:30:42.976]  Just a thing.
[02:30:42.976 --> 02:30:45.737]  Trump confirms he spoke with great gentleman Tommy Tuberville.
[02:30:45.737 --> 02:30:49.078]  Project optimism about January 6th challenge.
[02:30:49.078 --> 02:30:49.639]  Optimism?
[02:30:49.639 --> 02:30:52.099]  How about you won the election?
[02:30:52.099 --> 02:30:53.360]  That's not optimism, that's fact.
[02:30:54.710 --> 02:31:04.004]  Devin Nunes won't join January 6th's Electoral College fight because he still needs to see what the evidence is.
[02:31:04.004 --> 02:31:05.787]  That's an interesting one.
[02:31:05.787 --> 02:31:07.990]  Isn't it?
[02:31:07.990 --> 02:31:09.272]  See what the evidence is.
[02:31:09.272 --> 02:31:10.213]  Well, I mean, you know.
[02:31:11.064 --> 02:31:16.106]  A million votes for Biden at 3.30 in the morning in six different states and none for Trump?
[02:31:16.106 --> 02:31:17.146]  That happens all the time!
[02:31:17.146 --> 02:31:18.386]  What are you talking about?
[02:31:18.386 --> 02:31:20.467]  That's a normal thing.
[02:31:20.467 --> 02:31:27.589]  Even Madison Cawthorn, who's going the way of a John McCain, a Dan Crenshaw, says that he will contest the 2020 election.
[02:31:27.589 --> 02:31:28.649]  I think that's pandering.
[02:31:28.649 --> 02:31:31.550]  Again, these Republicans do measurements.
[02:31:31.550 --> 02:31:32.311]  Oh, who will do this?
[02:31:32.311 --> 02:31:33.091]  Who will do that?
[02:31:33.091 --> 02:31:34.271]  You know, how does it benefit?
[02:31:34.271 --> 02:31:37.992]  So, I don't think the Republican Party is going to have Trump's back, folks.
[02:31:37.992 --> 02:31:39.033]  They never have had our back.
[02:31:39.033 --> 02:31:39.873]  Why would that change now?
[02:31:41.388 --> 02:31:42.929]  Oh, more censorship.
[02:31:42.929 --> 02:31:44.451]  Story at Infowars.com.
[02:31:44.451 --> 02:31:50.456]  YouTube removes video of Trump's lawyer's opening statement at Senate Committee hearing.
[02:31:50.456 --> 02:31:54.960]  Of course, we have uploaded that to Infowars.com, though, so you can watch it there.
[02:31:54.960 --> 02:31:58.704]  That's Jesse Benal laying out the damning instances of election fraud.
[02:31:58.704 --> 02:32:02.307]  But they say it doesn't exist!
[02:32:02.307 --> 02:32:03.428]  Well, it's just that way.
[02:32:03.428 --> 02:32:05.850]  It just doesn't exist!
[02:32:05.850 --> 02:32:07.572]  In fact, there wasn't even an election, really.
[02:32:08.541 --> 02:32:09.942]  It's actually more of an honest statement.
[02:32:09.942 --> 02:32:11.883]  There wasn't an election.
[02:32:11.883 --> 02:32:17.185]  There was a selection by China for Joe Biden.
[02:32:17.185 --> 02:32:20.927]  So they hacked into the voting machines.
[02:32:20.927 --> 02:32:30.971]  Dominion let them do it in about 13 counties and they were able to steal six states by doing so and thus stealing the election.
[02:32:30.971 --> 02:32:34.573]  It was all very well timed out and managed and planned.
[02:32:35.342 --> 02:32:36.823]  So, of course, though.
[02:32:36.823 --> 02:32:37.224]  Of course.
[02:32:37.224 --> 02:32:42.008]  The Chinese have been running things like this for thousands of years.
[02:32:42.008 --> 02:32:45.491]  So it's really nothing new to them.
[02:32:45.491 --> 02:32:52.396]  But the American people are seeing through this and Fox News's ratings are dying.
[02:32:52.396 --> 02:32:55.779]  And I mean dying.
[02:32:55.779 --> 02:33:03.186]  And a former contributor at Fox News is saying that he's talking to people at Fox News saying they are very nervous.
[02:33:04.528 --> 02:33:11.133]  And they have lost about half of their audience, and that's Eric Bolling making those statements.
[02:33:11.133 --> 02:33:30.367]  So, yeah, you lie to the American people, you go along with the steal of our election, you don't report reality, and you have a bunch of talking heads who spend four hours in makeup and zero hours in actual investigative research on television, yeah, your ratings are gonna tank when the country is in peril.
[02:33:30.367 --> 02:33:32.489]  Which is where we are at, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:33.527 --> 02:33:34.388]  We'll be right back.
[02:33:34.388 --> 02:33:36.950]  My final segment here, then Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[02:33:36.950 --> 02:33:44.638]  Don't go anywhere.
[02:33:44.638 --> 02:33:46.319]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[02:33:46.319 --> 02:33:47.721]  Thank you for holding.
[02:33:47.721 --> 02:33:48.422]  How you doing, Alex?
[02:33:49.229 --> 02:33:50.650]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[02:33:50.650 --> 02:33:51.871]  We're in such a critical time, brother.
[02:33:51.871 --> 02:33:52.611]  How are you?
[02:33:52.611 --> 02:33:53.392]  I love you, man.
[02:33:53.392 --> 02:33:55.713]  I want to make a quick plug.
[02:33:55.713 --> 02:33:57.595]  That DNA Force, I love it.
[02:33:57.595 --> 02:34:14.026]  I've been using it quite a while, and I just went and looked at the ingredients again the other day, and I see that it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine.
[02:34:14.696 --> 02:34:20.119]  And it helps channel that zinc into the cells, so people might want to take a look at that.
[02:34:20.119 --> 02:34:33.626]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle, because there's a lot of expensive products, and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks.
[02:34:33.626 --> 02:34:38.329]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together, and that's what produced this.
[02:34:38.329 --> 02:34:39.770]  So thanks for the plug.
[02:34:45.720 --> 02:34:52.989]  Anybody listening to my voice can simply search into the term Davos Group, technocracy, or technocrats.
[02:34:52.989 --> 02:35:04.482]  You will get Klaus Schwab and Jean-Claude Juncker and all the New World Order globalists like Xi Jinping saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments.
[02:35:05.203 --> 02:35:08.005]  But they want businessman technocrats over it.
[02:35:08.005 --> 02:35:09.446]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[02:35:09.446 --> 02:35:14.509]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[02:35:14.509 --> 02:35:17.812]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is.
[02:35:17.812 --> 02:35:23.655]  You see, he believes, because he's hidden it in plain view, and you're not speaking out against it, that he has a right to do it to you.
[02:35:23.655 --> 02:35:25.737]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[02:35:25.737 --> 02:35:27.178]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[02:35:27.178 --> 02:35:31.701]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[02:35:31.701 --> 02:35:33.082]  That means worldwide neo-feudalism.
[02:35:33.082 --> 02:35:34.443]  It is what it was.
[02:35:35.204 --> 02:35:40.654]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you before you take those shots.
[02:35:40.654 --> 02:35:43.078]  You might just want to find out who this villain is, alright?
[02:35:46.457 --> 02:35:57.447]  This message is not for our regular listeners who are informed and understand about the value of essential vitamins and minerals, meaning if you don't have them, you die long term.
[02:35:57.447 --> 02:35:58.988]  It's for new listeners.
[02:35:58.988 --> 02:36:02.931]  The power structure works around the clock to try to debilitate you and try to make you sickly.
[02:36:02.931 --> 02:36:05.274]  Please research, because this is life and death.
[02:36:05.994 --> 02:36:09.455]  Vitamins that are essential and minerals that are essential.
[02:36:09.455 --> 02:36:11.235]  Just type that into a search engine.
[02:36:11.235 --> 02:36:14.576]  You will see the top universities, CDC, all of them telling you this.
[02:36:14.576 --> 02:36:25.599]  But you won't see this on the nightly news because they don't want you at the big pharma companies to understand how to protect yourself to a great extent from what's going on in the world on a routine basis.
[02:36:26.299 --> 02:36:32.903]  We now have back-in-stock Winter Sun, the highest quality vitamin D3 with vitamin K for your body's immune system.

[02:37:06.609 --> 02:37:10.131]  And hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[02:37:10.131 --> 02:37:15.114]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[02:37:16.375 --> 02:37:20.058]  Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[02:37:20.058 --> 02:37:24.722]  But the new website is theresistance.video.
[02:37:24.722 --> 02:37:26.664]  Theresistance.video.
[02:37:26.664 --> 02:37:31.107]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[02:37:31.107 --> 02:37:41.716]  So the new URL that links right to band.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is at theresistance.video.
[02:37:41.716 --> 02:37:42.616]  Share the link.

[02:37:48.948 --> 02:37:58.794]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:58.794 --> 02:38:02.376]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:38:02.376 --> 02:38:07.980]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:38:07.980 --> 02:38:10.902]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:38:22.116 --> 02:38:28.819]  Well, the good news is, America is pissed about this stimulus bill.
[02:38:28.819 --> 02:38:34.042]  The bad news is, Trump's probably going to sign it.
[02:38:34.042 --> 02:38:36.383]  So, we'll wait and see.
[02:38:36.383 --> 02:38:38.624]  But, I mean, we... Oh boy, man.
[02:38:38.624 --> 02:38:42.926]  We the people are just getting raped from every angle.
[02:38:42.926 --> 02:38:46.128]  And I'm sorry to be graphic here, it's just ridiculous.
[02:38:48.429 --> 02:38:50.430]  I don't know how much more we can take of this, folks.
[02:38:50.430 --> 02:38:54.352]  I'm going to keep my cool here, but I'm at my wit's end.
[02:38:54.352 --> 02:38:54.952]  I'm done.
[02:38:54.952 --> 02:38:58.953]  I mean, it's just a joke, man.
[02:38:58.953 --> 02:39:01.795]  And now they're about to come at us with the mandatory vaccines.
[02:39:01.795 --> 02:39:02.595]  Oh, get ready.
[02:39:02.595 --> 02:39:10.478]  If Biden gets in, they'll come to your house, they'll hogtie you, and they'll put a vaccine right up your anus.
[02:39:10.478 --> 02:39:12.719]  They'll say it's good for you.
[02:39:12.719 --> 02:39:14.160]  Because, you know, chemical rape isn't enough.
[02:39:14.160 --> 02:39:16.401]  It has to be anal chemical rape.
[02:39:16.401 --> 02:39:16.861]  Excuse me.
[02:39:17.702 --> 02:39:25.668]  All right, let me do this news here, and then I'm going to be hosting the war room, taking your calls for three hours, 3 to 6 p.m.
[02:39:25.668 --> 02:39:28.930]  at band.video.
[02:39:28.930 --> 02:39:31.452]  Here's some of the latest in the COVID front.
[02:39:31.452 --> 02:39:39.758]  You can't sue Pfizer or Moderna if you have severe COVID vaccine side effects, and the government likely won't compensate you for damages either.
[02:39:49.684 --> 02:39:56.589]  You know, I mean, like, if you have a contractor build a house and the roof caves in and kills you, he's responsible!
[02:39:56.589 --> 02:40:03.514]  Or a building that collapses, or, you know, any other industry in the world!
[02:40:03.514 --> 02:40:06.516]  You would be held accountable all because of litigation.
[02:40:06.516 --> 02:40:11.239]  But, oh, the vaccine manufacturers are above the law.
[02:40:11.239 --> 02:40:15.502]  How did they get this power?
[02:40:15.502 --> 02:40:16.163]  I'm telling you, man.
[02:40:18.510 --> 02:40:26.116]  You know, Trump was great, and Trump had great intentions, but Trump obviously wasn't enough.
[02:40:28.191 --> 02:40:37.498]  If we can ever have a real election again, we need to send someone to the White House whose campaign policy is literally arrest every trader to this country, period.
[02:40:37.498 --> 02:40:38.599]  And I mean, lay it out.
[02:40:38.599 --> 02:40:43.743]  Anyone who's taken big pharmaceutical money, investigated, subpoenaed, immediate hearings.
[02:40:43.743 --> 02:40:49.427]  Anybody who's had any money, foreign involvement, like the Bidens, immediate subpoenas and hearings.
[02:40:49.427 --> 02:40:54.231]  And I mean, we need like Nuremberg-style trials, but just for the United States.
[02:40:55.839 --> 02:40:57.400]  Anything less of that, forget it, folks.
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:41:01.802]  I mean, your lineage are gonna be slaves.
[02:41:01.802 --> 02:41:06.204]  In San Francisco, drug overdoses have killed four times more people than COVID.
[02:41:06.204 --> 02:41:08.065]  Yeah, that's not just San Francisco, folks.
[02:41:08.065 --> 02:41:11.306]  There's more people that have died of a drug overdose this year than COVID.
[02:41:11.306 --> 02:41:13.987]  More people die of sunstroke this year of COVID.
[02:41:13.987 --> 02:41:16.308]  More people died in car accidents.
[02:41:16.308 --> 02:41:19.490]  Oh, but see, that all gets stacked up as COVID, and then they inflate the numbers.
[02:41:19.490 --> 02:41:19.950]  It's magic.
[02:41:21.496 --> 02:41:26.619]  German geneticist says people who refuse COVID vaccine should be denied medical treatment.
[02:41:26.619 --> 02:41:27.920]  Yep, that's one way they're going to do it.
[02:41:27.920 --> 02:41:31.021]  You're not going to be allowed into a hospital without the vaccine.
[02:41:31.021 --> 02:41:33.463]  And they'll have them all lined up for you to get it.
[02:41:33.463 --> 02:41:36.344]  It doesn't even matter, the vaccine is not effective.
[02:41:36.344 --> 02:41:37.905]  I mean, this is one of the biggest lies.
[02:41:37.905 --> 02:41:41.027]  Not only is it not safe, it's not effective.
[02:41:41.027 --> 02:41:44.469]  They already say you need at least two, maybe three rounds of the COVID shot.
[02:41:45.933 --> 02:41:47.474]  Because it's not effective.
[02:41:47.474 --> 02:41:54.440]  And now they're saying, and in fact I have the story right here, that there's already new strains of COVID.
[02:41:54.440 --> 02:42:00.264]  So just like it's the flu and it mutates every year, COVID is the flu so it's doing the same thing.
[02:42:00.264 --> 02:42:06.289]  So the vaccine that you get for COVID, by the time you've gotten the vaccine, it's already irrelevant.
[02:42:07.205 --> 02:42:13.130]  And now Fauci admits it, and he says, assume a new COVID strain is in the United States, you dirtbag.
[02:42:13.130 --> 02:42:14.291]  So there's one guy.
[02:42:14.291 --> 02:42:20.977]  We should have huge hearings, Nuremberg-style trials, and Anthony Fauci.
[02:42:20.977 --> 02:42:24.580]  Who should pay for the collapse of the American economy?
[02:42:24.580 --> 02:42:28.823]  Who should pay for all the people that are damaged by the vaccines?
[02:42:28.823 --> 02:42:31.406]  Who should pay for the selling out of our sovereignty?
[02:42:32.165 --> 02:42:32.966]  Who should pay?
[02:42:32.966 --> 02:42:33.926]  Who should be arrested?
[02:42:33.926 --> 02:42:34.987]  Who should go to jail?
[02:42:34.987 --> 02:42:36.008]  Those responsible.
[02:42:36.008 --> 02:42:37.309]  Who are those responsible?
[02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:39.050]  They're in Congress?
[02:42:39.050 --> 02:42:45.255]  They're in the bureaucracies?
[02:42:45.255 --> 02:42:50.678]  British government contracts firm to make COVID freedom passports.
[02:42:50.678 --> 02:42:51.479]  Here you go!
[02:42:51.479 --> 02:42:51.739]  Here you go!
[02:42:57.318 --> 02:43:02.156]  So your freedom passport, that's like, oh my gosh, your freedom passport is your slave pass.
[02:43:04.053 --> 02:43:06.755]  No, you don't need a Freedom Passport, it's called Freedom.
[02:43:06.755 --> 02:43:08.897]  This is your Slave Pass.
[02:43:08.897 --> 02:43:12.601]  So your Slave Pass will be, have you gotten all your vaccines?
[02:43:12.601 --> 02:43:14.382]  Do you have a good social credit score?
[02:43:14.382 --> 02:43:18.225]  Do you watch mainstream news and only mainstream news?
[02:43:18.225 --> 02:43:20.808]  Are you not banned on social media?
[02:43:20.808 --> 02:43:21.668]  Oh, okay, you know what?
[02:43:21.668 --> 02:43:25.952]  You can go here, you can travel here, you can go in this building, you can go to school, you can go to lunch, all this stuff.
[02:43:25.952 --> 02:43:28.815]  But if you miss any one of those checklists, forget it for you.
[02:43:30.472 --> 02:43:32.173]  And they'll make farming illegal.
[02:43:32.173 --> 02:43:38.159]  They'll make any independent means of survival completely illegal.
[02:43:38.159 --> 02:43:41.642]  That's why they're shutting down all these restaurants right now.
[02:43:41.642 --> 02:43:46.326]  And China is killing farmers right now with their weather weapons.
[02:43:46.326 --> 02:43:52.151]  Now, you don't think this is coming to America, but here is a sign.
[02:43:52.151 --> 02:43:54.373]  I believe this is at Reagan Airport.
[02:43:54.373 --> 02:43:55.073]  It could be Dulles.
[02:43:55.073 --> 02:43:57.776]  I'm not sure here, but here it is, folks!
[02:43:58.595 --> 02:44:00.535]  This is on a sign in an airport in America.
[02:44:00.535 --> 02:44:01.356]  Check your ID.
[02:44:01.356 --> 02:44:11.797]  Beginning on October 1st, 2021, you will need a real ID, compliant driver's license, enhanced driver's license, asterisk, or another acceptable form of ID to fly within the United States.
[02:44:11.797 --> 02:44:12.598]  You know what that is, folks?
[02:44:12.598 --> 02:44:14.978]  That's going to be your Freedom Pass.
[02:44:14.978 --> 02:44:18.919]  That's going to be your medical documentation.
[02:44:18.919 --> 02:44:20.959]  Oh, it's coming.
[02:44:20.959 --> 02:44:25.280]  Oh, it's, it's coming.
[02:44:25.280 --> 02:44:25.520]  You know,
[02:44:28.052 --> 02:44:35.877]  The biggest problem with Americans for the last 20, 40 years has been our pride.
[02:44:35.877 --> 02:44:44.962]  And I'm not the guy that sits here and blames everything on boomers or anything like that.
[02:44:44.962 --> 02:44:46.063]  That's not what I'm doing here.
[02:44:46.063 --> 02:44:47.264]  But it's just a fact.
[02:44:47.264 --> 02:44:55.729]  The boomer generation has had so much pride in this country, they've never wanted to admit that their generation watched this country die.
[02:44:56.971 --> 02:44:59.173]  They've never wanted to admit that.
[02:44:59.173 --> 02:45:00.794]  It's because of their pride.
[02:45:00.794 --> 02:45:02.256]  And rightfully so.
[02:45:02.256 --> 02:45:04.958]  You're an American.
[02:45:04.958 --> 02:45:15.368]  But it was that generation that let Bill Clinton rob us dry, the Bushes rob us dry, that led us to the younger generation electing Obama, who then robbed us dry.
[02:45:16.957 --> 02:45:20.058]  But it was the denial of how bad it was.
[02:45:20.058 --> 02:45:25.001]  It was the denial of how bad it really was in this country that got us to this point.
[02:45:25.001 --> 02:45:30.844]  And I'm not just singling out the boomers, but... Let's be honest.
[02:45:30.844 --> 02:45:32.444]  It's that generation you would bring this up to.
[02:45:32.444 --> 02:45:33.285]  Oh, it's impossible.
[02:45:33.285 --> 02:45:36.046]  That'll never happen here.
[02:45:36.046 --> 02:45:38.467]  Here it is!
[02:45:38.467 --> 02:45:40.608]  So again, I'm not trying to attack a whole generation of people.
[02:45:40.608 --> 02:45:41.549]  Believe me, I'm a millennial.
[02:45:41.549 --> 02:45:43.129]  My generation has its own problems.
[02:45:43.129 --> 02:45:45.751]  We think we're like fairy unicorns or something.
[02:45:47.359 --> 02:45:52.242]  But just in general, it's the denial of how bad it has gotten.
[02:45:52.242 --> 02:45:55.463]  It's the denial that you are no longer in a free country.
[02:45:55.463 --> 02:45:57.804]  You are no longer a free man in a free country.
[02:45:57.804 --> 02:45:58.945]  And you know what?
[02:45:58.945 --> 02:46:01.726]  You better realize it now.
[02:46:01.726 --> 02:46:07.769]  You better realize it now and starting to get mad and pushing back against this before it's too late.
[02:46:07.769 --> 02:46:11.791]  And it's going to be about 27 days before it's too late, bud.
[02:46:13.676 --> 02:46:21.421]  Um, Biden receives his vaccine, Fauci receives his vaccine, it's loving, it's the loving needle.
[02:46:21.421 --> 02:46:23.683]  If you even believe that, I don't.
[02:46:23.683 --> 02:46:30.167]  Airlines agree to Cuomo request for travelers to have negative COVID tests before flying from UK amid fear of new strain.
[02:46:30.167 --> 02:46:31.889]  Here it comes!
[02:46:31.889 --> 02:46:33.910]  Here it comes!
[02:46:33.910 --> 02:46:35.671]  Oh my gosh.
[02:46:35.671 --> 02:46:40.474]  Oh my gosh, InfoWars, those conspiracy theorists, those fake news hacks.
[02:46:45.962 --> 02:46:48.503]  Need a COVID test to fly?
[02:46:48.503 --> 02:46:51.043]  Freedom pass to fly?
[02:46:51.043 --> 02:46:53.384]  Vaccine to fly?
[02:46:53.384 --> 02:46:54.925]  Vaccine to go back to work?
[02:46:54.925 --> 02:46:58.746]  Vaccine to go to school?
[02:46:58.746 --> 02:47:00.346]  RNA messenger?
[02:47:00.346 --> 02:47:04.067]  RNA vaccine that rewrites your human genome?
[02:47:04.067 --> 02:47:05.268]  Ouch!
[02:47:05.268 --> 02:47:08.449]  How's that pride taste?
[02:47:08.449 --> 02:47:11.210]  How's that pride taste?
[02:47:11.210 --> 02:47:12.250]  Waffle House CEO?
[02:47:13.541 --> 02:47:25.185]  Calls out the COVID hoax, says zero COVID cases in all of their locations.
[02:47:25.185 --> 02:47:30.628]  It's a fake pandemic, man!
[02:47:30.628 --> 02:47:32.928]  InfoWars headline.
[02:47:32.928 --> 02:47:34.629]  Do mask mandates work?
[02:47:34.629 --> 02:47:36.650]  New analysis suggests they don't.
[02:47:37.810 --> 02:47:41.854]  No, actually masks spread disease!
[02:47:41.854 --> 02:47:42.535]  I know!
[02:47:42.535 --> 02:47:43.415]  Go figure!
[02:47:43.415 --> 02:48:01.973]  I mean, if you walked around all day, touching at the gas station, touching the pin pad when you check out, touching weights at the gym, you know, touching your car handle, you know, whatever it is, and then you put your hands and your fingers and your nose and your mouth all day, do you think you would get sick?
[02:48:02.998 --> 02:48:04.439]  Probably!
[02:48:04.439 --> 02:48:07.122]  That's what the mask does!
[02:48:07.122 --> 02:48:08.944]  So congratulations!
[02:48:08.944 --> 02:48:12.908]  Your mask is spreading COVID!
[02:48:12.908 --> 02:48:14.309]  Good for you!
[02:48:14.309 --> 02:48:15.510]  But!
[02:48:15.510 --> 02:48:18.873]  The murderous governor of New York says...
[02:48:20.993 --> 02:48:24.975]  If you're Santa at the mall, you must be wearing a mask.
[02:48:24.975 --> 02:48:27.537]  And the kids on Santa's lap must wear a mask.
[02:48:27.537 --> 02:48:29.218]  And everybody must wear a mask.
[02:48:29.218 --> 02:48:34.381]  And coming next, you must have a butt plug to stop COVID farts.
[02:48:34.381 --> 02:48:35.081]  The best product.
[02:48:35.081 --> 02:48:39.664]  I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm gonna tell you all now, if you haven't tried TurboForce, you need to try it.
[02:48:39.664 --> 02:48:41.005]  I've tried TurboForce with everything.
[02:48:42.383 --> 02:48:44.064]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[02:48:44.064 --> 02:48:45.745]  I put TurboForce in my coffee.
[02:48:45.745 --> 02:48:46.686]  That was a crazy week.
[02:48:46.686 --> 02:48:58.373]  I don't remember sleeping, but... As far as the products go, TurboForce is my favorite, and all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life, taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[02:48:58.373 --> 02:48:59.694]  Nobody wakes up in the morning...
[02:49:01.175 --> 02:49:03.557]  And thinks, I'm gonna give that person over there a better life.
[02:49:03.557 --> 02:49:04.958]  I'm gonna wake up today, you know what?
[02:49:04.958 --> 02:49:09.201]  I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[02:49:09.201 --> 02:49:11.442]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[02:49:11.442 --> 02:49:12.943]  I don't think that happens very often.
[02:49:12.943 --> 02:49:13.744]  It's never happened to me.
[02:49:13.744 --> 02:49:16.666]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy.
[02:49:16.666 --> 02:49:18.367]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[02:49:18.507 --> 02:49:21.270]  There's only one person who woke up and thought that, and that was me.
[02:49:21.270 --> 02:49:29.258]  I woke up and thought, you know what, okay, I want to take control of my life, I want to take control of my health, and that's why you need to go to Infowars.com and take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[02:49:29.258 --> 02:49:32.561]  Don't buy into the groupthink, don't drink the Kool-Aid, drink the TurboForce.
[02:49:32.561 --> 02:49:34.083]  Kool-Aid's bad and the TurboForce is good.
[02:49:36.582 --> 02:49:51.778]  Imagine a dystopic novel or a dystopic science fiction movie where if you've had a cold, you can be locked up in your home, you can be taken away, you can be forcibly inoculated with drugs that masquerade as vaccines that actually change your very DNA.
[02:49:51.778 --> 02:49:52.819]  Well, that's where we are in the year 2020.
[02:49:53.820 --> 02:49:57.783]  Global government, the United Nations, all these authoritarian groups admit they're doing it.
[02:49:57.783 --> 02:50:05.329]  They even admit that they're doing it for power and control and that they're not even worried about COVID-19.
[02:50:05.329 --> 02:50:07.711]  That's what Klaus Schwab and others have said.
[02:50:07.711 --> 02:50:09.092]  Think about how insane that is.
[02:50:09.092 --> 02:50:11.053]  Oh, and big tech's got to track you.
[02:50:11.053 --> 02:50:11.834]  They've got to trace you.
[02:50:11.834 --> 02:50:12.615]  They've got to control you.
[02:50:12.615 --> 02:50:14.776]  You've got to have apps leave your house.
[02:50:14.776 --> 02:50:15.557]  Why?
[02:50:15.557 --> 02:50:17.959]  You've got to have secret police come disappear you because
[02:50:18.739 --> 02:50:21.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:50:46.443 --> 02:50:58.927]  Transmitting worldwide from the Summit.News studios in the United Kingdom, you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:50:58.927 --> 02:50:59.708]  Hello, everybody.
[02:50:59.708 --> 02:51:00.868]  Welcome back.
[02:51:00.868 --> 02:51:04.870]  It is the Summit News Hour with me, your host, Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:51:04.870 --> 02:51:09.191]  I hope you're all having a good preparation for Christmas.
[02:51:09.191 --> 02:51:14.313]  My Christmas has been completely ruined and now I'm trapped here on what is being referred to as
[02:51:15.373 --> 02:51:16.694]  Plague Island.
[02:51:16.694 --> 02:51:20.397]  Yes, it was racist to call it the China virus.
[02:51:20.397 --> 02:51:26.042]  It was racist to suggest that we should stop incoming flights from China back in March.
[02:51:26.042 --> 02:51:29.264]  That was bigoted, that was xenophobic, that was horrific.
[02:51:29.264 --> 02:51:39.352]  But it's perfectly fine to ban British people from dozens of countries around the world and refer to the British Isles as Plague Island.
[02:51:39.352 --> 02:51:40.213]  So I am indeed
[02:51:41.061 --> 02:51:44.782]  Trapped alone on Plague Island for Christmas.
[02:51:44.782 --> 02:51:47.183]  It's going to be another fun one.
[02:51:47.183 --> 02:52:01.729]  And the reason for that is because on Saturday afternoon, our esteemed Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that London and the South East of England would be placed into what they refer to as Tier 4.
[02:52:01.729 --> 02:52:06.751]  Of course, that's just another name for complete and total lockdown.
[02:52:06.751 --> 02:52:07.411]  They banned
[02:52:08.450 --> 02:52:13.433]  Not only people traveling outside their immediate area, they banned all international travel.
[02:52:13.433 --> 02:52:19.777]  So now basically I'm banned from traveling 30 or 40 miles to the next tier down.
[02:52:19.777 --> 02:52:21.058]  That's illegal.
[02:52:21.058 --> 02:52:25.901]  So if you've got family, if you've got granny 30 miles away, you can't go and visit her.
[02:52:25.901 --> 02:52:26.682]  That's illegal.
[02:52:26.682 --> 02:52:28.663]  You may get stopped by the police.
[02:52:28.663 --> 02:52:29.784]  You may get fined.
[02:52:29.784 --> 02:52:31.945]  You may even get arrested.
[02:52:31.945 --> 02:52:33.626]  You can't travel internationally.
[02:52:34.500 --> 02:52:37.683]  Because they ban you domestically from doing so.
[02:52:37.683 --> 02:52:44.328]  And in dozens of different countries now, they're banning people from Britain being allowed into those countries.
[02:52:44.328 --> 02:52:45.709]  That's all illegal.
[02:52:45.709 --> 02:52:47.710]  But you know what isn't illegal?
[02:52:47.710 --> 02:52:56.237]  Flights landing from Africa, Brazil, China, and every other country on the planet, landing at London airports.
[02:52:56.237 --> 02:52:59.019]  These people from China, Brazil, Africa.
[02:52:59.019 --> 02:53:02.402]  Brazil, by the way, over 7 million coronavirus cases.
[02:53:03.382 --> 02:53:13.377]  This new strain, the mutant strain that we're all supposed to be terrified of, was found in Brazil eight months ago, but those people are allowed to come here
[02:53:14.292 --> 02:53:22.078]  In fact, multiple flights from Sao Paulo, Brazil, landing basically every half an hour at Heathrow Airport, at Gatwick Airport.
[02:53:22.078 --> 02:53:29.543]  Those people are allowed to come here, even though they've got record coronavirus cases, even though they've got the new mutant strain and had it eight months ago.
[02:53:29.543 --> 02:53:35.988]  They can come here, but because Boris Johnson has literally set up internal borders while leaving
[02:53:36.588 --> 02:53:39.072]  The external border's wide open.
[02:53:39.072 --> 02:53:46.383]  I'm not allowed to travel 20, 30 miles away to see family in a different tier.
[02:53:46.383 --> 02:53:48.586]  We literally have internal borders.
[02:53:49.505 --> 02:53:51.826]  And I mean, they're just taking the piss at this point.
[02:53:51.826 --> 02:53:53.327]  They're taking the piss.
[02:53:53.327 --> 02:53:54.588]  We have flights landing.
[02:53:54.588 --> 02:54:00.611]  I hear them every five minutes overhead at Heathrow Airport from every other country in the world.
[02:54:00.611 --> 02:54:06.074]  But if I go to Brighton, if I go 40, 50 miles away, I face arrests and fines.
[02:54:07.256 --> 02:54:08.877]  That's the situation.
[02:54:08.877 --> 02:54:13.561]  Again, because of this new mutant strain which they're claiming is new, which isn't new.
[02:54:13.561 --> 02:54:14.962]  It's already in Europe.
[02:54:14.962 --> 02:54:17.023]  It was in Brazil eight months ago.
[02:54:17.023 --> 02:54:26.190]  Now you have top scientists, you have a top German virologist, which we're going to get into on the other side of the break, saying that they weren't even informed of this new strain.
[02:54:26.190 --> 02:54:30.153]  There are literally 300 different strains of coronavirus.
[02:54:30.153 --> 02:54:32.015]  It was announced on a press conference
[02:54:32.714 --> 02:54:43.785]  Literally putting tens of millions of people on the eve of Christmas under de facto house arrest, ruining their Christmas plans, and then prompting this mass travel ban.
[02:54:44.736 --> 02:54:52.562]  In Spain, Germany, France and all these other countries from Brits trying to enter other countries to visit their family members.
[02:54:52.562 --> 02:54:58.546]  Oh, and by the way, if you've booked a flight, which many people have, their Christmas plans are already completely ruined.
[02:54:58.546 --> 02:55:03.209]  But not only that, they're not even going to get refunds on the flights.
[02:55:03.209 --> 02:55:06.612]  The flight operators are still operating the flights because maybe
[02:55:07.350 --> 02:55:11.232]  Two Spanish people are going home from London back to Spain.
[02:55:11.232 --> 02:55:21.297]  So rather than cancel the flights and have to give people their refunds, they're going to still operate all the flights, even though they'll be 95% empty.
[02:55:21.297 --> 02:55:26.759]  And when people complained about this to the government, they said, there's nothing whatsoever we can do about it.
[02:55:26.759 --> 02:55:30.741]  So they were screwed by Boris because their Christmas plans were ruined.
[02:55:30.741 --> 02:55:31.802]  They're not going to see their family.
[02:55:32.614 --> 02:55:36.736]  And now they're being screwed by the airlines because they're not going to get their refunds.
[02:55:36.736 --> 02:55:38.477]  We'll get into that and more on the other side.
[02:55:38.477 --> 02:55:39.038]  Summit.News.
[02:55:39.038 --> 02:55:43.320]  Don't go away.
[02:55:43.320 --> 02:55:46.402]  Winter Sun has been sold out for months.
[02:55:46.402 --> 02:55:47.462]  It's now back in stock.
[02:55:47.462 --> 02:55:50.964]  It's the highest quality vitamin D3 you're going to find anywhere.
[02:55:50.964 --> 02:55:56.267]  You take it out of the tongue for maximum absorption or just put it in your mouth and drink it down.
[02:55:56.267 --> 02:56:01.590]  It's absolutely an essential vitamin, meaning if you don't have it and you have a deficiency from it, you will die.
[02:56:02.170 --> 02:56:03.612]  The system doesn't want you to know this.
[02:56:03.612 --> 02:56:10.982]  And they don't want you to know that they've lowered the allowance of what they claim you need every day to a level that makes you very, very sickly and easy to control.
[02:56:10.982 --> 02:56:15.027]  But now we have Winner's Sum of Vitamin D3 and Vitamin K that helps it upload better.
[02:56:15.027 --> 02:56:18.873]  And it's also excellent for your immune system at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:56:18.873 --> 02:56:19.634]  Sold out for months.
[02:56:20.154 --> 02:56:24.576]  I'm still going to sell it at 50% off because everyone needs it.
[02:56:24.576 --> 02:56:31.079]  Get it for yourself, get it for your husband, your wife, your children, your neighbors, especially folks that work indoors and don't get any sun.
[02:56:31.079 --> 02:56:35.901]  It's absolutely critical to get your Winter Sun, now available again at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:56:35.901 --> 02:56:39.023]  Again, Winter Sun at InfoWarStore.com is back in stock.
[02:56:45.831 --> 02:56:51.269]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:56:55.774 --> 02:57:06.661]  So we have a situation in the United Kingdom where the pubs are closed, Christmas is cancelled, people's plans are being completely ruined, they're not going to see their family members, but guess what?
[02:57:06.661 --> 02:57:14.906]  The borders, the external borders at least, are going to remain wide open to anyone who wants to enter this country.
[02:57:14.906 --> 02:57:21.530]  I can't travel 30 miles away because I face fines and arrests because I'm in Tier 4 and I can't go to Tier 3.
[02:57:23.246 --> 02:57:35.720]  But if people from Shanghai, Beijing, Sao Paulo or Kenya, Nairobi, Kenya want to visit the United Kingdom and visit London, they're perfectly free to do so.
[02:57:35.720 --> 02:57:38.583]  In what world does that make any sense?
[02:57:38.583 --> 02:57:45.010]  Flights from Africa, Brazil and China continue to land at Heathrow, even as Londoners are banned from travel.
[02:57:46.041 --> 02:57:58.348]  Flights from countries all over the world, including COVID-19 hotspots like Brazil, continue to land at London airports, despite Londoners themselves being banned by law from travelling outside the area.
[02:57:58.348 --> 02:58:09.334]  If you want to go on FlightAware, the FlightAware website, and zero in on London, and then go a little bit west, where you'll find Heathrow Airport,
[02:58:10.160 --> 02:58:11.661]  You can click on all the planes.
[02:58:11.661 --> 02:58:14.543]  You can see where they're coming from, where they're going to.
[02:58:14.543 --> 02:58:16.084]  They're coming from Kenya.
[02:58:16.084 --> 02:58:17.765]  They're coming from Sao Paulo.
[02:58:17.765 --> 02:58:20.107]  They're coming from Beijing.
[02:58:20.107 --> 02:58:21.508]  They're coming from everywhere.
[02:58:21.508 --> 02:58:23.649]  They can get in, but we can't get out.
[02:58:23.649 --> 02:58:33.816]  Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Saturday London and the south-east of England would be placed under a new lockdown, Tier 4, making it illegal for Londoners to travel outside the region.
[02:58:34.710 --> 02:58:42.034]  He also revealed that people living in Tier 4 areas would be banned from international travel, forcing millions of Brits who plan to visit family abroad to cancel their Christmas.
[02:58:42.034 --> 02:58:48.778]  And who knows when we'll be allowed to travel again, and if we'll be allowed to travel without the vaccine.
[02:58:48.778 --> 02:58:56.222]  Even to get to Spain, and now this is already being introduced by numerous of the European countries, you had to get a Covid test.
[02:58:56.869 --> 02:59:01.611]  a PCR test and prove it was negative simply to get into Spain.
[02:59:01.611 --> 02:59:05.333]  And of course we know these PCR tests are notoriously unreliable.
[02:59:05.333 --> 02:59:10.155]  They produce false positives repeatedly.
[02:59:10.155 --> 02:59:11.956]  They're totally unreliable.
[02:59:11.956 --> 02:59:14.177]  So you could not have COVID whatsoever.
[02:59:14.177 --> 02:59:19.860]  We've had people taking these tests who have had COVID six weeks ago.
[02:59:19.860 --> 02:59:21.581]  They've completely recovered.
[02:59:21.581 --> 02:59:26.163]  Six weeks to two months later they take the PCR test and it says they've still got COVID.
[02:59:27.901 --> 02:59:31.002]  And that's the thin end of the wedge.
[02:59:31.002 --> 02:59:36.183]  Next it'll be if you don't have the vaccine passport, which initially they denied they were even planning.
[02:59:36.183 --> 02:59:40.844]  Now they're literally planning it in government documents to enter other countries.
[02:59:40.844 --> 02:59:54.047]  And we got more on that in terms of France and Germany talking about banning people who don't have the vaccine from using public transport and entering other venues and in fact being denied medical care altogether.
[02:59:54.047 --> 02:59:56.808]  I'm going to get onto that later on in the show.
[02:59:58.646 --> 03:00:07.568]  But this article continues, while Londoners are not allowed to hop on a flight, plane loads full of foreign visitors continue to land at Heathrow and other major airports in the region.
[03:00:07.568 --> 03:00:12.969]  Two days after Londoners were banned from travel or flight from Nairobi, Kenya landed at Heathrow.
[03:00:12.969 --> 03:00:20.730]  Oh, that's obviously very crucially important that we import Kenyans during the height of a pandemic.
[03:00:20.730 --> 03:00:22.071]  That's crucial.
[03:00:22.071 --> 03:00:23.611]  We can't stop that from happening.
[03:00:24.864 --> 03:00:26.765]  That's really important, isn't it?
[03:00:26.765 --> 03:00:33.970]  Flights from China, the original source of the coronavirus, also continue to land in London on a regular basis.
[03:00:33.970 --> 03:00:44.257]  Yesterday, no less than five flights from Brazil arrived at Heathrow Airport, despite the country registering over 7 million COVID-19 cases.
[03:00:44.257 --> 03:00:47.439]  And then we get on to the reason behind all this.
[03:00:48.795 --> 03:00:58.640]  The reason why Prime Minister Boris Johnson has literally created internal borders within the United Kingdom while leaving the external borders wide open.
[03:00:58.640 --> 03:01:00.020]  In fact, we have another article here.
[03:01:00.020 --> 03:01:06.003]  Video pictures British travellers held against their will at German airports.
[03:01:06.003 --> 03:01:11.966]  Chaos unfolded in the UK with the government touting an unverified mutant strain of Covid.
[03:01:11.966 --> 03:01:15.247]  There are literally 200 different strains.
[03:01:15.247 --> 03:01:15.928]  Literally 200 or more.
[03:01:17.916 --> 03:01:24.002]  It's not more harmful than the original one, but this is the excuse.
[03:01:24.002 --> 03:01:31.009]  To justify a fresh lockdown, video has emerged of British travellers being herded inside foreign airports and held against their will.
[03:01:31.009 --> 03:01:41.160]  The footage shows health officials and nurses, some in full hazmat gear, administering immediate Covid-19 tests as passengers plead, please help us leave.
[03:01:42.310 --> 03:01:52.197]  So they introduced these COVID tests as a mandatory measure to be allowed to get into the country on a whim while people were literally still in the air on these planes.
[03:01:52.197 --> 03:02:00.384]  Oh, and by the way, that cost another £200 to go and get a COVID test, a PCR test that isn't even reliable.
[03:02:00.384 --> 03:02:11.512]  So a lot of these people who have family in Spain, in France, in all these other countries, not only are they not going to get their money back on the flight, because they're still operating the flights even though they're completely empty,
[03:02:12.350 --> 03:02:15.173]  Ryanair in particular.
[03:02:15.173 --> 03:02:26.023]  They've also shelled out £200, over $200 on these PCR tests, which are now completely redundant because they're literally banned from leaving the country.
[03:02:26.023 --> 03:02:32.770]  And even if they manage to leave the country somehow, they're banned from getting into Spain and France and Germany and these other countries.
[03:02:33.809 --> 03:02:35.290]  There's quoting here.
[03:02:35.290 --> 03:02:38.432]  We are at Hanover Airport and we are held against our will.
[03:02:38.432 --> 03:02:44.436]  We were tested and were prohibited from leaving the premises while awaiting the results.
[03:02:44.436 --> 03:02:52.701]  Hanover health official Andreas Krentz told German Newswire DPA that, quote, our aim is to prevent the new variant of the virus from entering the region.
[03:02:52.701 --> 03:02:54.863]  It's already in the region.
[03:02:54.863 --> 03:02:56.564]  It's spread throughout Europe.
[03:02:57.705 --> 03:02:59.667]  It was in Brazil eight months ago.
[03:02:59.667 --> 03:03:05.751]  How is it not in Europe when you've got planes landing from Brazil every half an hour?
[03:03:05.751 --> 03:03:15.999]  It's a complete myth that this mutant strain only exists in the United Kingdom, but apparently now we're Plague Island and that's okay to refer to Britain as Plague Island.
[03:03:15.999 --> 03:03:20.383]  Don't call it the China virus though, that means you're racist.
[03:03:20.383 --> 03:03:22.144]  Another headline here at Summit.News.
[03:03:22.850 --> 03:03:29.493]  Scientist MPs ask, where is evidence of 70% more contagious mutant COVID?
[03:03:29.493 --> 03:03:47.921]  As London and the entire southeast of the UK was plunged into a fresh lockdown over the weekend, scores of countries have banned all travel to and from the UK, but scientists there are demanding to see any evidence that there is a 70% more contagious mutant strain of COVID, having not been shown anything by the government.
[03:03:47.921 --> 03:03:51.202]  They just announced it in a press conference and that's enough apparently!
[03:03:52.321 --> 03:04:03.445]  The Daily Mail reports Carl Hennigan, Professor of Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University, has expressed scepticism over the 70% figure.
[03:04:03.445 --> 03:04:11.447]  He says, I've been doing this job for 25 years, I can tell you, you can't establish a quantifiable number in such a short time frame.
[03:04:11.447 --> 03:04:20.710]  They didn't even open it up to the other scientists, they just announced it in a press conference because they needed to get everyone under de facto house arrest right before Christmas.
[03:04:21.644 --> 03:04:43.858]  After having initially, of course, said that, you know, graciously giving us a four-day period from the 23rd of October, I think it was, to the 27th, where we would be allowed, and we were so grateful, we would be allowed to meet with people from not one, but two other households.
[03:04:43.858 --> 03:04:48.961]  My God, can you imagine being allowed by the government to meet up with
[03:04:49.662 --> 03:04:51.743]  Family members from two different households.
[03:04:51.743 --> 03:04:57.405]  We were so graciously, graciously thankful.
[03:04:57.405 --> 03:04:58.945]  And now that's gone as well.
[03:04:58.945 --> 03:05:01.026]  Tier 4, you can't even meet with anyone.
[03:05:01.026 --> 03:05:02.627]  You're literally under house arrest.
[03:05:02.627 --> 03:05:05.047]  You can't leave the area.
[03:05:05.047 --> 03:05:08.569]  But people from Beijing and Shanghai, they can come in, they can do whatever they want.
[03:05:08.569 --> 03:05:11.170]  Borders are wide open.
[03:05:11.170 --> 03:05:17.792]  So Hannigan continued, speaking about this mutant strain which isn't new at all and has existed for at least eight months.
[03:05:18.541 --> 03:05:22.623]  He says, every expert is saying it's too early to draw such an inference.
[03:05:22.623 --> 03:05:29.325]  I would want to have very clear evidence rather than we think it's more transmissible so we can see if it is or not.
[03:05:29.325 --> 03:05:31.506]  He said it's had massive implications.
[03:05:31.506 --> 03:05:33.547]  It's causing fear and panic.
[03:05:33.547 --> 03:05:36.248]  Yeah, that was the reason why they came out with it.
[03:05:36.248 --> 03:05:41.570]  But we should not be in this situation where the government is putting out data that is unquantifiable.
[03:05:41.570 --> 03:05:48.173]  They are fitting the data to the evidence, which is what they've done all along.
[03:05:49.790 --> 03:05:53.854]  Another top scientist calling out this mutant strain.
[03:05:53.854 --> 03:06:00.802]  RT reports top German virologist cast doubt on fears of new highly contagious UK COVID-19 strain.
[03:06:00.802 --> 03:06:05.887]  This is from Christian Drosten, the head of Virology Department of Berlin's Charite Center.
[03:06:06.789 --> 03:06:12.552]  He said suddenly there is this figure out there, 70%, and no one even knows what is meant by that.
[03:06:12.552 --> 03:06:20.036]  The virologist believes there is just not enough data to really say that the new strain is any more dangerous than the existing ones.
[03:06:20.036 --> 03:06:26.919]  But it doesn't matter what he says, doesn't matter what the other scientists say, they just announced it in a press conference and now because of this,
[03:06:28.012 --> 03:06:32.337]  We're going to be locked down until Easter or beyond.
[03:06:32.337 --> 03:06:37.743]  Lockdown 3.0, which is going to lead to lockdown 4.0 ad infinitum.
[03:06:37.743 --> 03:06:40.505]  It never ends because they don't want it to.
[03:06:40.505 --> 03:06:41.146]  We'll be right back.
[03:06:41.146 --> 03:06:42.508]  Summit.News don't go away.

[03:08:12.315 --> 03:08:19.660]  The year 2021 is almost here, and so we're launching our New Year's specials right now.
[03:08:19.660 --> 03:08:21.101]  We've got two different big sales.

[03:08:38.633 --> 03:08:39.474]  We're good to go.
[03:08:58.527 --> 03:09:07.655]  Again, the year 2021 is here, and I am committed to you to fight against the globalists harder than ever, so thank you so much for keeping InfoWars in the fight.
[03:09:07.655 --> 03:09:15.262]  Without your support, we couldn't do any of it.
[03:09:15.262 --> 03:09:17.905]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:26.307 --> 03:09:35.493]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[03:09:35.493 --> 03:09:42.738]  We are back broadcasting live from what they are now referring to as Plague Island, because we're all imprisoned and trapped within it.
[03:09:42.738 --> 03:09:52.344]  And apparently it's all because of this mutant new strain of coronavirus that isn't new at all, and in fact was in Brazil eight months ago.
[03:09:52.344 --> 03:09:52.784]  Headline.
[03:09:53.607 --> 03:09:57.849]  Reports UK infection rate lower than countries cutting it off.
[03:09:57.849 --> 03:10:01.411]  Mutant COVID was seen in Brazil eight months ago.
[03:10:01.411 --> 03:10:06.833]  And this is nothing more than xenophobia against Britain and against Brits.
[03:10:06.833 --> 03:10:21.720]  Despite nations all over the world beginning to isolate from the UK, banning travel to and from Britain, Britain not banning any travel whatsoever that's incoming from China and Brazil, and effectively cutting it off, the infection rate is lower there than several other countries.
[03:10:22.330 --> 03:10:28.354]  As noted by the Daily Mail, infection rates in Britain are still lower than in Sweden, Denmark, Croatia and Holland.
[03:10:28.354 --> 03:10:31.697]  Nevertheless, these countries are isolating themselves from the UK.
[03:10:31.697 --> 03:10:33.978]  Very xenophobic, very racist.
[03:10:33.978 --> 03:10:41.003]  After the government there hyped a mutant strain of Covid to justify another lockdown without presenting any evidence.
[03:10:41.003 --> 03:10:45.226]  And that's not me saying that, that's top virologists and scientists saying that.
[03:10:45.226 --> 03:10:48.008]  Footage has emerged of British travellers being detained in foreign airports.
[03:10:48.008 --> 03:10:49.209]  We talked about that before the break.
[03:10:50.117 --> 03:10:56.082]  Meanwhile, the British government has not closed its borders to any incoming flights at all.
[03:10:56.082 --> 03:11:03.848]  All these other countries have closed their borders, even though they've got literally higher coronavirus rates than the UK.
[03:11:03.848 --> 03:11:11.193]  Scientists working with the government in Britain also claim that the new supercharged strain was present in Brazil eight months ago.
[03:11:11.193 --> 03:11:18.099]  So even the scientists advising the British government, which is claiming this mutant strain is new, are saying it isn't new.
[03:11:19.289 --> 03:11:31.038]  Studies show the mutation called N501Y was spotted in the South American country in April before later rearing its head again in Australia and the United States.
[03:11:31.038 --> 03:11:32.900]  That's according to the London Telegraph.
[03:11:32.900 --> 03:11:35.482]  And it's also across Europe.
[03:11:35.482 --> 03:11:40.666]  It's already in these same countries that are banning travel based on the fact that it's a new strain.
[03:11:40.666 --> 03:11:43.048]  When it isn't a new strain, it's already throughout the world.
[03:11:43.888 --> 03:11:55.938]  The report further notes that leading scientific advisors explained the N501Y strain did not cause much alarm earlier in the year because it failed to rip through populations on its own.
[03:11:55.938 --> 03:12:01.782]  And yet they're telling us that it's 70% worse than the original Covid strain.
[03:12:01.782 --> 03:12:09.769]  The strain is thought to have been spreading in the UK since September, but only now, days before Christmas and after Parliament has broken up for the holiday,
[03:12:10.248 --> 03:12:11.909]  As the government spoken about it.
[03:12:11.909 --> 03:12:12.769]  And they did that.
[03:12:12.769 --> 03:12:21.712]  They sent all the MPs back home so they couldn't come back to Parliament and challenged the government, forced them into holding a vote on this new tier system.
[03:12:21.712 --> 03:12:26.694]  Because this tier system was introduced on the basis that Parliament would have a vote on it.
[03:12:26.694 --> 03:12:27.975]  Imagine that.
[03:12:27.975 --> 03:12:34.037]  Our own elected officials, our own elected MPs, having a say on law.
[03:12:34.037 --> 03:12:34.778]  Imagine that.
[03:12:34.778 --> 03:12:35.818]  It's crazy, right?
[03:12:37.062 --> 03:12:48.589]  But no, they all sent them packing, they sent them back home, then afterwards introduced this law on the hoof, on a whim, so it couldn't be challenged in Parliament.
[03:12:48.589 --> 03:12:59.136]  Scientists in Britain also state the hint to look for the N501Y came from scientists who were tracking this mutation in South Africa, so it was already in South Africa too.
[03:12:59.136 --> 03:13:01.378]  Both the British and South African variants.
[03:13:01.378 --> 03:13:04.800]  By the way, people from South Africa, they're totally welcome to come in!
[03:13:05.638 --> 03:13:11.059]  I've seen flights from South Africa landing at Heathrow too, where they have the same strain.
[03:13:11.059 --> 03:13:16.321]  But I can't travel 30 miles or I might be arrested.
[03:13:16.321 --> 03:13:18.641]  But appear to evolve independently of one another.
[03:13:18.641 --> 03:13:25.323]  South Africa's health minister suggested on Friday that the new strain present there seems to have a more severe effect on young people.
[03:13:25.323 --> 03:13:27.464]  But again, come on in!
[03:13:27.464 --> 03:13:30.545]  Scientists independent of the government are asking to see the evidence.
[03:13:30.545 --> 03:13:32.025]  We talked about that before the break.
[03:13:34.008 --> 03:13:37.330]  Professor Cole Hennigan said, I've been doing this job for 25 years.
[03:13:37.330 --> 03:13:43.555]  I can tell you, you can't establish a quantifiable number in such a short time frame.
[03:13:43.555 --> 03:13:45.176]  So it's all baloney.
[03:13:45.176 --> 03:13:49.759]  What's also baloney is the notion that police can even enforce any of this.
[03:13:49.759 --> 03:13:56.484]  We've seen polls, which I'm going to get into shortly, which show massive support for lockdown measures.
[03:13:57.190 --> 03:14:00.312]  The worse they get, the support seems to just grow.
[03:14:00.312 --> 03:14:09.359]  I don't know who they're asking in these polls because anecdotally that's not what I'm seeing, witnessing or experiencing out in the real world.
[03:14:09.359 --> 03:14:15.524]  You go in the barbers, you go in pubs when we were allowed to, you go in restaurants.
[03:14:15.524 --> 03:14:19.627]  Everybody's talking about this and everybody's speaking out against it.
[03:14:19.627 --> 03:14:26.853]  There was a woman in the pub literally telling half the pub how she works in an NHS hospital and they're completely empty.
[03:14:28.635 --> 03:14:31.057]  And we're going to get on to that too, but here's a headline.
[03:14:31.057 --> 03:14:35.520]  UK police, there are no powers to enforce Christmas travel ban.
[03:14:35.520 --> 03:14:47.209]  Police in the UK have admitted they have no legal authority to enforce a travel ban in and out of London and the South East after the government instituted a third lockdown, cancelling Christmas for millions of people.
[03:14:47.209 --> 03:14:54.395]  The London Telegraph reports, officials from the Police Federation say officers do not have the power to stop people travelling to
[03:14:55.618 --> 03:15:01.422]  Or to stop cars and check if citizens are unlawfully visiting relatives and friends for Christmas.
[03:15:01.422 --> 03:15:14.990]  Now, of course, we had Priti Patel, the Home Secretary, come out last week and say police should enforce these measures, which would bring the prospect of them literally knocking on people's doors on Christmas Day to see if there were
[03:15:15.658 --> 03:15:18.060]  Too many people gathering in one place.
[03:15:18.060 --> 03:15:30.007]  So the government has literally encouraged people to spy on each other, to snitch on each other, and yet the police force itself across the country is saying they're not going to enforce it, because they can't.
[03:15:30.007 --> 03:15:32.789]  This police chief said it's heavily reliant on public compliance.
[03:15:32.789 --> 03:15:36.512]  The restriction isn't on traveling, it's on leaving the house.
[03:15:36.512 --> 03:15:38.353]  That's what a police source told the Telegraph.
[03:15:39.028 --> 03:15:45.613]  He said, the more reasonable excuses there are, the more there will be opportunities to claim an exemption where, in truth, one doesn't exist.
[03:15:45.613 --> 03:15:52.238]  Because again, in the law, if they challenge you and say, why are you outside your house, pleb?
[03:15:52.238 --> 03:15:55.300]  Legally, you're not obliged to tell them.
[03:15:55.300 --> 03:15:58.022]  So it's completely toothless.
[03:15:58.022 --> 03:16:03.566]  In addition, it's only legal for police to stop motorists if they have witnessed a traffic violation.
[03:16:03.566 --> 03:16:07.209]  Now that being said, we have seen videos, there was one a couple of weeks ago,
[03:16:08.135 --> 03:16:17.024]  Where it was an Elvis impersonator, literally in his home, on his own, doing karaoke to an Elvis song.
[03:16:17.024 --> 03:16:19.947]  His back is turned to the door.
[03:16:19.947 --> 03:16:21.688]  The police bust in.
[03:16:21.688 --> 03:16:22.909]  He thinks he's being robbed.
[03:16:22.909 --> 03:16:24.151]  He thinks it's an intruder.
[03:16:24.151 --> 03:16:26.373]  He literally goes and tries to attack the police.
[03:16:27.282 --> 03:16:32.708]  Obviously because one of his neighbours snitched on him because the music was too loud.
[03:16:32.708 --> 03:16:34.390]  So you are going to get a lot of that.
[03:16:34.390 --> 03:16:46.283]  You're going to get a lot of curtain twitches over the Christmas and New Year period reporting their neighbours to the police because the government literally encouraged them to do that.
[03:16:46.283 --> 03:16:49.146]  There you see the Elvis impersonator, the Covid
[03:16:50.091 --> 03:16:54.954]  Police force, the COVID inspectors just burst into his house, no warrant whatsoever.
[03:16:54.954 --> 03:16:59.517]  He tries to attack them, not realizing that it's the police and not an intruder.
[03:16:59.517 --> 03:17:02.799]  And you're going to see more of that over the next week.
[03:17:02.799 --> 03:17:04.640]  Because you're going to have New Year's Eve.
[03:17:04.640 --> 03:17:08.683]  They've banned, you know, all the pubs are closed for tens of millions of people.
[03:17:08.683 --> 03:17:12.205]  People being told they're not allowed to gather, even with their own friends and family.
[03:17:12.205 --> 03:17:14.326]  Do you really think they're going to abide by that?
[03:17:14.326 --> 03:17:18.389]  In fact, there was a poll a few weeks ago, or in fact, I think it was a couple of months ago,
[03:17:19.304 --> 03:17:34.494]  Which found that although the vast majority of people agree, in the polls they say they consent to these lockdown measures, when they were asked to be honest about if they've actually complied with them personally, only 18% said they had.
[03:17:34.494 --> 03:17:36.795]  So of course there's mass non-compliance.
[03:17:36.795 --> 03:17:46.862]  Of course you're going to get people in their dozens in some cases, or at least groups of 10-15 people, going to each other's houses on New Year's Eve,
[03:17:47.401 --> 03:17:49.343]  For massive house parties.
[03:17:49.343 --> 03:17:53.207]  Now the question remains, are the police going to break those up?
[03:17:53.207 --> 03:18:04.640]  Because you can be damn sure that there are going to be thousands upon thousands of house parties across the country on New Year's Eve, in violation of this ridiculous, ubiquitous law.
[03:18:04.640 --> 03:18:06.862]  Will the police stop?
[03:18:11.648 --> 03:18:18.933]  Anybody listening to my voice can simply search into the term Davos Group, technocracy, or technocrats.
[03:18:18.933 --> 03:18:33.942]  You will get Klaus Schwab and Jean-Claude Juncker and all the New World Order globalists like Xi Jinping saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments, that they want businessmen technocrats over them.
[03:18:33.942 --> 03:18:35.362]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is.
[03:18:35.362 --> 03:18:37.364]  You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched
[03:18:38.044 --> 03:18:40.573]  The COVID-19 lockdowns could bankrupt you and make you poor.
[03:18:40.573 --> 03:18:43.282]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is.
[03:18:44.275 --> 03:18:49.518]  I mean, he believes, because he's hidden it in plain view, and you're not sticking out against it, that he has a right to do it to you.
[03:18:49.518 --> 03:18:51.660]  You might want to find out who he works for.
[03:18:51.660 --> 03:18:53.101]  He works directly for Prince Charles.
[03:18:53.101 --> 03:18:57.603]  He developed, since the 80s, the plan for global sustainability.
[03:18:57.603 --> 03:19:01.166]  That means worldwide neo-feudalism, in his own words.
[03:19:01.166 --> 03:19:06.589]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you, before you take those shots.
[03:19:06.589 --> 03:19:09.031]  You might just want to find out who this villain is, alright?
[03:19:11.437 --> 03:19:15.603]  Christmas 2020 is here but will soon be gone.
[03:19:15.603 --> 03:19:28.019]  But I want to encourage all of you to recommit the year 2020, and I'm talking to myself when I say this, to exercise and treat our bodies better and to take high quality supplements along with a nutritious diet.
[03:19:29.100 --> 03:19:42.164]  We got back in stock just a few days ago a big shipment of Winter Sun, the highest quality vitamin D3 you're going to find, also with vitamin K. These are essential vitamins for your immune system.
[03:19:42.164 --> 03:19:46.366]  With everything going on in the world, it's important for all of us to protect ourselves.
[03:19:46.366 --> 03:19:47.066]  It's for children,
[03:19:47.686 --> 03:19:51.649]  It's for women, it's for men, it's for young, it's for old, it's for everybody.
[03:19:51.649 --> 03:19:55.092]  It's winter sun sold out for almost three months.

[03:20:30.943 --> 03:20:32.464]  Ban.video.
[03:20:32.464 --> 03:20:35.966]  And hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned.
[03:20:35.966 --> 03:20:40.969]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it.
[03:20:42.149 --> 03:20:45.912]  Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[03:20:45.912 --> 03:20:50.575]  But the new website is TheResistance.Video.
[03:20:50.575 --> 03:20:52.496]  TheResistance.Video.
[03:20:52.496 --> 03:20:56.959]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[03:20:56.959 --> 03:21:07.566]  So the new URL that links right to Band.Video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is at TheResistance.Video.
[03:21:07.566 --> 03:21:08.486]  Share the link.
[03:21:08.486 --> 03:21:10.067]  TheResistance.Video.
[03:21:10.067 --> 03:21:11.108]  TheResistance.Video.
[03:21:13.405 --> 03:21:24.153]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:21:24.153 --> 03:21:31.898]  You're listening to Summit.News with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:21:31.898 --> 03:21:40.544]  So in the United Kingdom we have officially now internal borders while the external borders remain wide open.
[03:21:40.544 --> 03:21:41.645]  And all for what?
[03:21:42.884 --> 03:21:49.505]  The amount of deaths year-on-year in the United Kingdom is roughly the same as it's been for the past 5-10 years.
[03:21:49.505 --> 03:21:56.887]  In fact, the 2017-18 flu season claimed more deaths year-on-year than this current season, 2019-2020.
[03:21:56.887 --> 03:22:01.848]  Now we have this headline out of the Mail Online.
[03:22:01.848 --> 03:22:06.009]  Are hospitals really creaking under the strain of Covid before Christmas?
[03:22:06.009 --> 03:22:11.970]  The hospitals are emptier right now compared to this same time last year.
[03:22:13.334 --> 03:22:19.618]  Last year they were 90% full, now they're only 85% full.
[03:22:19.618 --> 03:22:33.688]  The article states, and this is based on official data by the way, NHS data still shows hospitals to be quieter than they were this time last year, compared to this time last year, amid the looming threat of a third national lockdown in the new year.
[03:22:33.688 --> 03:22:41.714]  Despite the health service having more breathing room than 12 months ago, Boris Johnson refused to rule out another national shutdown, and that's going to happen by the way.
[03:22:42.981 --> 03:22:46.222]  January, the whole country is going to be shut down again.
[03:22:46.222 --> 03:22:58.388]  Figures show there were 15,465 people in hospital with COVID in England on December 16th, compared to 18,974 on the worst day in spring.
[03:22:58.388 --> 03:23:01.249]  November's lockdown effects appear to have worn off.
[03:23:01.249 --> 03:23:05.951]  Oh yeah, there were more infections before the lockdown than after the lockdown.
[03:23:05.951 --> 03:23:08.952]  Sorry, after the lockdown than before the lockdown in London.
[03:23:08.952 --> 03:23:10.093]  The lockdown didn't work,
[03:23:10.828 --> 03:23:12.249]  So now we have another one.
[03:23:12.249 --> 03:23:13.390]  And then another one.
[03:23:13.390 --> 03:23:14.151]  And then another one.
[03:23:14.151 --> 03:23:17.213]  Because these lockdowns work so well.
[03:23:17.213 --> 03:23:19.455]  Article continues.
[03:23:19.455 --> 03:23:22.858]  In more confirmation the number 10 is struggling to keep a lid on the epidemic.
[03:23:22.858 --> 03:23:28.403]  SAGE today claimed Britain's COVID-19 reproduction R-rate is definitely above 1 again.
[03:23:28.403 --> 03:23:34.828]  But statistics suggest the health service is overall coping better with its workload than it did last winter.
[03:23:34.828 --> 03:23:36.850]  Before this pandemic was even a thing.
[03:23:38.166 --> 03:23:41.129]  A greater proportion of ward beds are free.
[03:23:41.129 --> 03:23:43.651]  Intensive care units have more room.
[03:23:43.651 --> 03:23:49.156]  And A&E departments aren't yet turning ambulances away more often than usual.
[03:23:49.156 --> 03:23:53.860]  With the exception of a bad day at one NHS trust in the Midlands.
[03:23:53.860 --> 03:23:59.925]  Meanwhile, of course, they're cancelling all the both elective procedures and serious treatments
[03:24:00.865 --> 03:24:14.093]  Cancers and the like, so people aren't getting access to their cancer treatments, either because they're afraid to go into the hospitals because they've been so terrified by the mainstream media, or because those treatments, those operations are being cancelled.
[03:24:14.093 --> 03:24:15.834]  So more excess deaths from that.
[03:24:15.834 --> 03:24:19.516]  They don't even take that into account when they make these policies.
[03:24:19.516 --> 03:24:26.400]  And the occupancy figure does not take into account bolstered capacity at the mothballed Nightingale Hospitals.
[03:24:26.400 --> 03:24:28.862]  Of course, just like you had the Navy ship
[03:24:29.628 --> 03:24:38.490]  Cruising into New York at the height of the pandemic back in spring, which was almost immediately turned away because they didn't need it.
[03:24:38.490 --> 03:24:43.911]  We had all these temporary Nightingale hospitals built in the United Kingdom.
[03:24:43.911 --> 03:24:49.252]  And almost to every single one of them, they were not used.
[03:24:49.252 --> 03:24:55.333]  The NHS is also benefiting from record levels of staff, so they're completely not overwhelmed.
[03:24:55.333 --> 03:24:56.993]  There's a graph here on this article
[03:24:58.024 --> 03:25:02.087]  It says, how does NHS pressure compare to 2019?
[03:25:02.087 --> 03:25:07.892]  Average percentage of beds occupied in 2019, December last year, 94.9%.
[03:25:07.892 --> 03:25:13.577]  Right now, 2020, 89%.
[03:25:13.577 --> 03:25:18.941]  So it's less occupancy, the hospitals are emptier right now than they were last year.
[03:25:18.941 --> 03:25:26.367]  And yet we're being presented with this hysterical notion that hospitals are being overwhelmed, that people are going to be dying in corridors.
[03:25:27.202 --> 03:25:30.645]  It's simply not happening.
[03:25:30.645 --> 03:25:34.528]  Percentage of intensive care beds full.
[03:25:34.528 --> 03:25:38.172]  In 2019, December, this term last year, it was 83.8%.
[03:25:38.172 --> 03:25:41.995]  Right now, 2020, it's only 75%.
[03:25:41.995 --> 03:25:50.082]  And those numbers are direct from the NHS.
[03:25:50.082 --> 03:25:54.826]  By the way, somebody worked it out on lockdownsceptics.org, which is an excellent website tracking all this.
[03:25:56.044 --> 03:26:14.189]  That the chances of you, or at least if you live in the United Kingdom, it's probably similar in the United States, the chances of you being infected with COVID, passing it on to somebody else and then dying from it, you know, this whole thing about, oh, you're so irresponsible for killing granny.
[03:26:14.189 --> 03:26:24.112]  The chances of that happening, somebody worked out, and I'm going to go through the numbers here, are the same chances of you winning the lottery.
[03:26:24.112 --> 03:26:25.372]  It's that rare.
[03:26:27.086 --> 03:26:32.511]  First of all, given that you have no symptoms, what are the chances that you're infected with COVID?
[03:26:32.511 --> 03:26:39.437]  The Office of National Statistics in the UK estimates this to be 1 in 115 or 0.87%.
[03:26:39.437 --> 03:26:47.464]  Now, imagining you are infected but you don't have any symptoms, what's the probability you will infect somebody else with COVID?
[03:26:47.464 --> 03:26:49.226]  Recent studies show this is around 0.7%.
[03:26:51.934 --> 03:27:01.257]  So if we multiply the probability of these two events, we can calculate the likelihood of you A, being infected, and B, passing that infection on without symptoms.
[03:27:01.257 --> 03:27:05.919]  This gives a figure of 0.006%.
[03:27:05.919 --> 03:27:14.682]  To put that figure into context, it's roughly the same as your chance of dying in a car crash over the course of any given year.
[03:27:14.682 --> 03:27:15.782]  Incredibly rare.
[03:27:16.786 --> 03:27:20.928]  But if you infect someone, this doesn't mean they're going to end up dying of COVID pneumonia.
[03:27:20.928 --> 03:27:22.649]  Far from it, in fact.
[03:27:22.649 --> 03:27:31.034]  There's a lot of debate regarding the IFR of SARS-CoV-2, but the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine puts it at roughly 0.5%.
[03:27:31.034 --> 03:27:37.098]  Now, if we multiply the chance of infecting another person without symptoms by the fatality rate,
[03:27:37.754 --> 03:27:50.805]  We can estimate that the risk of killing one of your relatives is roughly, and bear with me here, 0.000003%, or one in three million.
[03:27:50.805 --> 03:27:52.627]  That's the risk.
[03:27:52.627 --> 03:27:54.608]  Obviously, there are a lot of caveats.
[03:27:54.608 --> 03:27:59.212]  If one of your relatives is very old and very ill, then that's going to be a higher risk.
[03:27:59.212 --> 03:28:02.195]  If they're relatively healthy, it's going to be a lower risk.
[03:28:03.200 --> 03:28:05.961]  But there's another caveat, and that is PCR tests.
[03:28:05.961 --> 03:28:08.562]  Of course, notoriously unreliable.
[03:28:08.562 --> 03:28:15.225]  The first number we use in the number of infected individuals in the UK is based on positive PCR results.
[03:28:15.225 --> 03:28:20.688]  It's possible that only 3% of these positive results are actually accurate.
[03:28:20.688 --> 03:28:25.130]  Which means the risk of a person killing a relative without any discernible coronavirus symptoms
[03:28:26.030 --> 03:28:30.574]  May well be as low as 1 in 30 million.
[03:28:30.574 --> 03:28:37.159]  The same sort of likelihood of you winning the national lottery.
[03:28:37.159 --> 03:28:41.342]  Continues, clearly it's for individuals to assess the risk for themselves.
[03:28:41.342 --> 03:28:45.145]  But they should do so in the knowledge of how big those risks actually are.
[03:28:45.145 --> 03:28:51.950]  And when you boil down the numbers, when you crunch the numbers, it's the same risk as you winning the national lottery.
[03:28:53.385 --> 03:29:14.089]  So you think, given those statistics, given the fact that hospital beds are emptier than they were at this time last year, given the fact that this whole hysteria about this new mutant strain of Covid is complete bonk because it's been around for eight months, you think the population would temper their enthusiasm for draconian police state de facto house arrest lockdowns
[03:29:15.760 --> 03:29:17.040]  And that's not the case.
[03:29:17.040 --> 03:29:19.261]  In fact, they support them even more.
[03:29:19.261 --> 03:29:38.708]  Now, whether you can believe these polls or not, whether you think it's people telling the pollsters what they think they want to hear, maybe whether you think it's these people being afraid of being found out of going public with not supporting this Covid lockdown because they're so terrified of being publicly cancelled on social media or whatever,
[03:29:41.221 --> 03:29:47.304]  Guido Falk's blog reports three quarters of Britain support the creation of the new tier 4 coronavirus restrictions.
[03:29:47.304 --> 03:29:49.625]  This is a poll by YouGov.
[03:29:49.625 --> 03:29:58.250]  By 61 to 33, Brits think the government has handled the issue of Christmas coronavirus rules badly, but then when they ask them if they support them,
[03:29:59.938 --> 03:30:05.079]  The general population found that 74% of the population supported them.
[03:30:05.079 --> 03:30:12.662]  So literally 74% of people, apparently, if you believe these polls, don't want to see their family members at Christmas.
[03:30:12.662 --> 03:30:15.622]  They want even harsher lockdowns.
[03:30:15.622 --> 03:30:19.424]  If you can believe that, I've got a bridge to sell you.
[03:30:19.424 --> 03:30:20.964]  Because as I said, anecdotally,
[03:30:21.540 --> 03:30:35.288]  All I hear in the real world, all I hear on social media, all I read on the comments below all these major articles on major news websites, is that there's a massive backlash against these measures.
[03:30:35.288 --> 03:30:50.838]  And surely that's going to expand now, given that not only have the Christmases of millions and millions of people who are planning to travel abroad to see their family members being ruined, completely ruined, now they're not even going to get their refunds from flight operators
[03:30:51.755 --> 03:30:54.838]  Because they've said we're not cancelling their flights.
[03:30:54.838 --> 03:31:01.364]  We're still going to operate the flights even though there are literally like two Spaniards on one flight flying home.
[03:31:01.364 --> 03:31:04.927]  They're allowed to enter Spain obviously, but we're not.
[03:31:04.927 --> 03:31:09.692]  Is that really believable?
[03:31:09.692 --> 03:31:11.374]  Mountain Patriot in Colorado.
[03:31:11.374 --> 03:31:12.775]  Thank you for holding.
[03:31:12.775 --> 03:31:13.456]  How you doing Alex?
[03:31:14.264 --> 03:31:15.685]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can.
[03:31:15.685 --> 03:31:16.946]  We're in such a critical time, brother.
[03:31:16.946 --> 03:31:17.646]  How are you?
[03:31:17.646 --> 03:31:18.446]  I love you, man.
[03:31:18.446 --> 03:31:20.768]  I want to make a quick plug.
[03:31:20.768 --> 03:31:22.649]  That DNA Force, I love it.
[03:31:22.649 --> 03:31:39.078]  I've been using it quite a while, and I just went and looked at the ingredients again the other day, and I see that it contains quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkula has cited, is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine.
[03:31:39.770 --> 03:31:45.173]  And it helps channel the zinc into the cells, so people might want to take a look at that.
[03:31:45.173 --> 03:31:58.659]  All I know is with DNA Force, we went out and looked at these high-end products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle, because there's a lot of expensive products and it's really only cost them like 50 bucks.
[03:31:58.659 --> 03:32:03.361]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this.
[03:32:03.361 --> 03:32:04.822]  So thanks for the plug.
[03:32:10.731 --> 03:32:14.153]  The globalists and their minions want to play God.
[03:32:14.153 --> 03:32:17.275]  Chuckie Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama.
[03:32:17.275 --> 03:32:21.618]  You look at these sacks of garbage and you think, why do they hate humanity so much?
[03:32:21.618 --> 03:32:23.299]  Why do they love death?
[03:32:23.299 --> 03:32:26.261]  Because they hate themselves.
[03:32:26.261 --> 03:32:30.944]  They project their own disgust with their soul onto us.
[03:32:31.944 --> 03:32:37.107]  And once you understand that basic psychological point, every other answer is completely clear.
[03:32:37.107 --> 03:32:38.848]  That's why they hate InfoWars.
[03:32:38.848 --> 03:32:39.969]  We believe in humanity.
[03:32:39.969 --> 03:32:41.170]  We think you're beautiful.
[03:32:41.170 --> 03:32:42.810]  We think you're amazing.
[03:32:42.810 --> 03:32:48.234]  InfoWars knows you're fallen, but that you have God's potential that God gave you.
[03:32:48.234 --> 03:32:50.655]  Ladies and gentlemen, the great epic battle is now here.
[03:32:50.655 --> 03:32:51.876]  It's now upon us.
[03:32:51.876 --> 03:32:57.399]  I want to encourage you all to spread the word about InfoWars now more than ever, when the enemy hopes to shut down the light of truth.
[03:32:58.080 --> 03:32:59.622]  We know you're gonna override these globalists.
[03:32:59.622 --> 03:33:00.704]  We know you're gonna defeat them.
[03:33:00.704 --> 03:33:03.729]  I just want to salute you all for your action, everything you've already done.
[03:33:03.729 --> 03:33:07.095]  Because God's on our side, and the globalists know it.
[03:33:11.147 --> 03:33:13.528]  The post-industrial world.
[03:33:13.528 --> 03:33:22.790]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992.
[03:33:22.790 --> 03:33:27.271]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030, which is a post-industrial world.
[03:33:27.271 --> 03:33:33.152]  Klaus Schwab of the Davos Group, Trudeau, the Prime Minister of Canada, they're all on record saying the Great Reset is Agenda 2030.
[03:33:36.013 --> 03:33:39.036]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is.
[03:33:39.036 --> 03:33:42.159]  It is the destruction of society as we know it.
[03:33:42.159 --> 03:33:44.121]  It is making the population poor.
[03:33:44.121 --> 03:33:50.046]  By design, so we can be controlled with a medical technocracy over you and your family.
[03:33:50.046 --> 03:33:53.349]  They are destroying civilization, rebuild it, and they're dystopic.
[03:33:54.310 --> 03:33:55.671]  Image.
[03:33:55.671 --> 03:33:59.613]  We are fighting this at InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[03:33:59.613 --> 03:34:06.737]  We are fighting for a pro-human future, and we need you to get the facts, to research it and share it with others, and join the fight.
[03:34:06.737 --> 03:34:07.618]  God bless you.
[03:34:07.618 --> 03:34:11.160]  Visit us, spread the word, at InfoWars.com.
[03:34:11.160 --> 03:34:13.361]  You must guard your humanity.
[03:34:13.361 --> 03:34:16.202]  You must guard your children's humanity.
[03:34:16.202 --> 03:34:18.984]  You must guard the very genetic code of the planet.
[03:34:18.984 --> 03:34:21.966]  The loveless have set themselves up as the guardians of this world.
[03:34:23.266 --> 03:34:27.490]  They are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet.
[03:34:27.490 --> 03:34:34.898]  They are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human on earth through the GMO crops.
[03:34:34.898 --> 03:34:41.885]  And now they've moved on to their main target, humanity, with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines.
[03:34:41.885 --> 03:34:46.129]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted, cloned fetuses.
[03:34:47.242 --> 03:34:49.563]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:35:29.622 --> 03:35:38.388]  Live from the Summit.News headquarters, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:35:38.388 --> 03:35:50.036]  So let's turn our attention to this coronavirus vaccine, which apparently is completely fine when it comes to tackling all these hundreds of other new, new mutant strains of coronavirus.
[03:35:50.036 --> 03:35:53.538]  We have to lock down for that, we have to be under house arrest, but don't worry about the vaccine.
[03:35:53.538 --> 03:35:55.139]  It's not going to affect the vaccine.
[03:35:56.400 --> 03:35:59.462]  Well, now people have been researching more into vaccine reactions.
[03:35:59.462 --> 03:36:07.648]  Of course, you saw the video a couple of days ago of the nurse receiving a vaccine and basically passing out within two minutes.
[03:36:07.648 --> 03:36:19.377]  Well, now the CDC has, and this was again posted on lockdownsceptics.org, the CDC has produced a document documenting the side effects of the mRNA COVID vaccine.
[03:36:20.742 --> 03:36:27.306]  It says, in frequent cases of anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction have been reported already.
[03:36:27.306 --> 03:36:37.293]  However, a more interesting figure is to be found further down in the presentation, in a table entitled V-safe active surveillance for COVID-19 vaccines.
[03:36:37.293 --> 03:36:40.816]  It says out of the 112,807 doses administered, 3,150 experienced what they call a, quote, health impact event.
[03:36:49.315 --> 03:36:59.139]  Described above by the CDC as quote, unable to perform normal daily activities, unable to work, required care from doctor or healthcare professional.
[03:36:59.139 --> 03:37:02.101]  That's about 2.8% of recipients.
[03:37:02.101 --> 03:37:09.064]  Now, we're not arguing that adverse reactions to vaccines in small numbers on a routine thing.
[03:37:10.871 --> 03:37:28.054]  Problem is, we're being told that we have to remain under lockdown, remain under house arrest, we're banned from travelling internally in our own country, we're banned from travelling abroad, so as not to overwhelm the NHS, so as not to overwhelm the hospitals.
[03:37:28.054 --> 03:37:38.676]  Problem being, if the UK Government's declared target of vaccinating approximately 25 million people in priority groups is met, and the proportion remains stable,
[03:37:40.231 --> 03:37:58.981]  That 2.8% figure of adverse vaccine reactions in the UK alone, obviously much higher numbers in the United States, could mean around 700,000 people potentially requiring some kind of medical care post-vaccination.
[03:37:58.981 --> 03:38:02.843]  They asked the question, isn't mass vaccination supposed to protect the NHS?
[03:38:04.170 --> 03:38:13.216]  So we're being told that hospitals are being overwhelmed, that there's going to be a nightmare onslaught of new cases, people dying in the corridors.
[03:38:13.216 --> 03:38:23.883]  And yet by their own numbers, this vaccine and the adverse reactions to it are going to create 700,000 people requiring medical attention.
[03:38:23.883 --> 03:38:27.986]  Another thing that doesn't quite add up.
[03:38:27.986 --> 03:38:29.607]  Meanwhile, let's get into masks.
[03:38:30.854 --> 03:38:45.442]  Have you ever noticed, by the way, and today especially, out in the park I see more people wearing masks outside, even though there's literally no law in the United Kingdom that says they have to do that.
[03:38:45.442 --> 03:38:49.884]  More people seem to have swallowed the blue pill and they're wearing masks.
[03:38:49.884 --> 03:38:53.966]  These people tend to look very serious, very righteous.
[03:38:53.966 --> 03:38:55.607]  They're good people.
[03:38:55.607 --> 03:38:59.809]  They also appear to look like they've got a stick up their backside.
[03:39:00.697 --> 03:39:05.758]  And that was evidenced once more again with this story yesterday.
[03:39:05.758 --> 03:39:10.240]  Leftist ridiculed for bragging about wearing two face masks.
[03:39:10.240 --> 03:39:12.880]  Bid for Twitter clout goes horribly wrong.
[03:39:12.880 --> 03:39:25.464]  Now, of course, as is standard at this point, as soon as I started gaining attention, the individual in question, don't know whether he deleted his original tweet or blocked me for a start, but he put his account on lockdown.
[03:39:25.464 --> 03:39:26.544]  So you can't even see if he's
[03:39:27.085 --> 03:39:28.625]  Original tweet is still there.
[03:39:28.625 --> 03:39:32.446]  Thankfully I screenshotted it, knowing that that would happen.
[03:39:32.446 --> 03:39:37.508]  And this was a leftist who bragged about wearing not one, but two face masks.
[03:39:37.508 --> 03:39:43.229]  He said, quote, taking no chances queue at Waitrose today, which is a supermarket in England.
[03:39:43.229 --> 03:39:47.730]  Two masks, N95 and surgical.
[03:39:47.730 --> 03:39:51.631]  And this is a guy who has pro-EU remain in his bio.
[03:39:51.631 --> 03:39:53.932]  Surprisingly doesn't have his pronouns in his bio.
[03:39:55.103 --> 03:40:11.167]  But of course, by trying to virtue signal for internet clout, by graciously wearing two face masks to show that he's such a good, responsible citizen, he only proved that the first face mask, according to his own rules here, doesn't work.
[03:40:11.167 --> 03:40:15.808]  If the first one, if you're wearing two, then that only shows that the first one doesn't work.
[03:40:15.808 --> 03:40:17.448]  So what's the point?
[03:40:17.448 --> 03:40:22.350]  Of course, great merriment was had at his expense.
[03:40:22.350 --> 03:40:23.970]  And he panicked and shut down his account.
[03:40:24.775 --> 03:40:34.643]  By the way, his tweet after that said that he would not be responding to what he called right-wing snowflakes.
[03:40:34.643 --> 03:40:40.267]  He said, quote, they seem to be making the mistake of thinking that I give an S-H-I-T what they think.
[03:40:40.267 --> 03:40:47.353]  He then proceeded to spend the rest of the day responding on Twitter to right-wing snowflakes.
[03:40:47.353 --> 03:40:52.497]  And this ties into a very important article, which is up on The Blaze, entitled Horowitz.
[03:40:53.174 --> 03:40:59.260]  Comprehensive analysis of 50 states shows greater spread with mask mandates.
[03:40:59.260 --> 03:41:06.287]  Yes, there are more coronavirus cases in states in America where they mandated masks.
[03:41:06.287 --> 03:41:15.497]  He writes, for months we've been lectured by the political elites that masks, that cases of coronavirus are spreading too quickly and that we must wear masks to stop the spread.
[03:41:16.209 --> 03:41:27.136]  The obvious fault with their act of desperation is that they can no longer mask the fact that most parts of the country have already been fully masked for months, long before the ubiquitous spread this fall.
[03:41:27.136 --> 03:41:29.357]  And you see this in European countries.
[03:41:29.357 --> 03:41:37.982]  In Spain, Italy, France, as soon as they mandated the wearing of masks, both indoors and outdoors, coronavirus cases shot way up.
[03:41:37.982 --> 03:41:44.106]  Continues researchers at rationalground.com, a clearinghouse of COVID-19 data, trends run by a grassroots group of data,
[03:41:44.955 --> 03:41:54.964]  Analysts, computer scientists and actuaries did an analysis of all 50 states, divided by those that had mask mandates and those that did not.
[03:41:54.964 --> 03:42:02.910]  Justin Hart, co-founder of the website, posted the results in a Twitter thread and shared with me the data analysis.
[03:42:02.910 --> 03:42:08.035]  Says they studied the number of cases over a 229-day period from May 1st through December 15th.
[03:42:09.366 --> 03:42:15.208]  Divided the results of the two study groups by days with mask mandates and days without mask mandates.
[03:42:15.208 --> 03:42:24.612]  The non-mandate data group includes both states that never had a mandate and those that did at some point, but data set included only the days they did not have a mask mandate.
[03:42:24.612 --> 03:42:33.796]  The results when comparing states with mandates versus those without, or periods of times within a state with a mandate versus without,
[03:42:34.363 --> 03:42:42.905]  There is absolutely no evidence that the mass mandate worked to slow the spread one iota.
[03:42:42.905 --> 03:42:47.986]  In total, in the states that had a mandate in effect, there were 9,605,000 confirmed COVID cases over 5,907 days.
[03:42:47.986 --> 03:42:49.086]  An average of 27 cases per 100,000 per day.
[03:42:57.580 --> 03:43:14.950]  When states did not have a statewide order, which includes the states that never had them, and the period of time masking states did not have the mandate in place, there were 5,781,000 cases over 5,700 days, averaging 17 cases per 100,000 people per day.
[03:43:14.950 --> 03:43:19.173]  The reverse correlation between periods of masking and non-masking is remarkable.
[03:43:19.173 --> 03:43:25.016]  So in the states where they did not mandate masks, they had fewer coronavirus cases.
[03:43:25.016 --> 03:43:26.237]  Isn't that interesting?
[03:43:26.837 --> 03:43:29.538]  But again, you're a bad person if you don't wear one.
[03:43:29.538 --> 03:43:32.160]  Maybe you need to wear two now.
[03:43:32.160 --> 03:43:34.041]  Maybe you need to wear a full gas mask.
[03:43:34.041 --> 03:43:36.662]  Maybe you even need to wear a full hazmat suit.
[03:43:36.662 --> 03:43:55.412]  And actually, I'm probably going to commission a poll, because I commissioned a poll, I think it was back in 2013 during the whole TSA debacle, which asked Americans if they would submit to a full body cavity search in order to be allowed to fly.
[03:43:56.178 --> 03:44:00.062]  This was in 2013, I believe, 2012 or 2013.
[03:44:00.062 --> 03:44:11.051]  The result of the poll was that almost a third of Americans said that they would submit to a full-body TSA cavity search, that's basically an anal probe, not to get too graphic, in order to fly.
[03:44:11.051 --> 03:44:19.419]  So I'm going to do a poll asking people in the United Kingdom, where apparently we have such massive compliance, if you believe the polls already put out,
[03:44:20.279 --> 03:44:25.962]  What level of imposition on their liberties, on their dignity, are they willing to undergo?
[03:44:25.962 --> 03:44:27.142]  Are they willing to accept?
[03:44:27.142 --> 03:44:31.585]  Are they willing to tolerate in order to go about their lives?
[03:44:31.585 --> 03:44:43.931]  And I'm deliberately, if a polling agency accepts this, because they're all grossly politicized, so many of them won't even have anything to do with me, what level of imposition, what level of lockdown measures will people accept?
[03:44:43.931 --> 03:44:49.934]  Will they accept, for example, the government telling them they're not allowed to go near their own window?
[03:44:50.839 --> 03:44:57.022]  Will they accept the government telling them they have to wear full hazmat suits to leave their own home?
[03:44:57.022 --> 03:45:05.006]  It's going to be very interesting as to the level, the percentage of compliance of people who accept those measures.
[03:45:05.006 --> 03:45:09.027]  And that's hopefully going to be happening here in the next couple of weeks.
[03:45:09.027 --> 03:45:10.548]  Finally, we have a raft of stories.
[03:45:10.548 --> 03:45:14.450]  French law would ban people who don't get Covid vaccine from using public transport.
[03:45:15.310 --> 03:45:30.007]  Thankfully, there's massive backlash from all the opposition politicians in France at what they're now calling a health dictatorship because of this new law that would literally ban people who don't have the vaccine from using public transport from visiting venues.
[03:45:30.547 --> 03:45:37.869]  And in Germany, German geneticist says people who refuse Covid vaccine should be denied medical treatment.
[03:45:37.869 --> 03:45:44.111]  Literally saying that if they need ventilators, if they need emergency medical treatment, that it should be denied.
[03:45:44.111 --> 03:45:48.032]  We also have British government contracts firms to make Covid freedom passports.
[03:45:48.032 --> 03:45:49.432]  Initially they denied it.
[03:45:49.432 --> 03:45:53.793]  Now they're saying potentially you will need to get the vaccine to travel.
[03:45:53.793 --> 03:45:54.373]  Gonna wrap it up.
[03:45:54.373 --> 03:45:55.593]  War Room is coming up next.
[03:45:55.593 --> 03:45:56.314]  Summit.News.
[03:45:56.314 --> 03:45:57.254]  We're going.
