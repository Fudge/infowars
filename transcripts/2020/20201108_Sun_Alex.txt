[00:00:00.723 --> 00:00:02.965]  Well, InfoWars was born for this.
[00:00:03.305 --> 00:00:04.506]  The battle for the Republic.
[00:00:04.746 --> 00:00:07.808]  The United States totally surrounded, fighting for its life.
[00:00:08.448 --> 00:00:12.170]  I've been on there 26 plus years, for the moment we're now living in.
[00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.775]  And I can tell you, as bad as it is, we're going to come through this stronger, on the other side, no matter what happens to Trump.
[00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:24.949]  I'd wish that we could bypass what's coming.
[00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.670]  I wish we could have gone around this.
[00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.251]  Wish we could have had an easy landing and kept Trump.
[00:00:30.271 --> 00:00:32.571]  There's still 20% chance of doing that.
[00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:36.032]  There's about 100% chance of doing that if Trump takes dramatic action.
[00:00:37.032 --> 00:00:44.494]  Now, my brain is so on fire, and I brainstormed so hard this morning, from about 6 a.m.
[00:00:44.534 --> 00:00:48.455]  to about 12 noon when I got to the office, that
[00:00:51.877 --> 00:00:57.860]  I got completely exhausted about an hour and a half ago and had to go take a nap because I had smoke coming out of my ears.
[00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.901]  I mean, I have war game to every angle.
[00:01:00.662 --> 00:01:02.563]  I know exactly what they're going to pull next.
[00:01:03.223 --> 00:01:04.644]  I know what their next move is.
[00:01:05.684 --> 00:01:06.905]  And it's not bragging.
[00:01:06.965 --> 00:01:11.007]  It's well known that I have this large map of the operation in my head.
[00:01:12.128 --> 00:01:13.789]  And it doesn't make me have a power trip.
[00:01:14.821 --> 00:01:22.262]  To have the White House calling up asking what they think they should do and to have the Democrats watching everything we say, it actually scares the living hell out of me.
[00:01:23.903 --> 00:01:26.743]  Because that's the thing, these globalists don't think two or three steps ahead.
[00:01:28.304 --> 00:01:32.545]  They think two or three steps ahead about what they want and power they want, but not about the big picture.
[00:01:33.445 --> 00:01:37.846]  And so, I'm not gonna stop, I'm not gonna quit, I'm not gonna give up.
[00:01:38.486 --> 00:01:44.387]  But I gotta be honest with you, to watch the American people reject a really great president like President Trump,
[00:01:45.703 --> 00:01:52.725]  And to watch the corporate media reject the president, I mean, he won the election clearly, by a landslide, and they stole it so far.
[00:01:53.605 --> 00:01:57.506]  But still, it should be 95% of America rejecting this.
[00:01:58.066 --> 00:01:58.726]  It shouldn't be 50%.
[00:02:02.047 --> 00:02:04.647]  Because a good 20% didn't vote.
[00:02:08.848 --> 00:02:14.630]  And so that means even if he won, what, 40-something percent voted?
[00:02:15.976 --> 00:02:19.140]  It should have been basically almost everybody getting this understanding.
[00:02:20.201 --> 00:02:25.067]  I've looked at Biden's policies and he means to... The one area he's been honest is what he's going to carry out.
[00:02:25.087 --> 00:02:29.031]  Because he says all that knowing his constituents are idiots and he knows they'll follow orders.
[00:02:29.792 --> 00:02:32.015]  And the CHICOMS know he needs to say what he's going to do.
[00:02:33.547 --> 00:02:37.588]  His ending of fossil fuels would starve the whole planet.
[00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.889]  His shutting down of fracking would cause a depression.
[00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.671]  His shutting down of the coal power plants would destroy the country.
[00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:50.973]  And then bringing back Obamacare and getting rid of companies being able to match 401Ks will end 401Ks.
[00:02:54.947 --> 00:02:56.768]  I mean, I could go for hours.
[00:02:56.888 --> 00:03:01.129]  It's so horrible that I spend hours and hours a week reading his policies.
[00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:04.650]  And it's so horrible, I get a headache and get dizzy.
[00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.650]  Because it's so bad.
[00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.151]  It's like, I promise to cut your legs off and stab you in the head.
[00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:11.552]  Like, oh, I want that!
[00:03:13.973 --> 00:03:15.773]  And then to get the young people to vote for him.
[00:03:15.913 --> 00:03:21.155]  Oh, and free health care, and free education, and free cars, and a guaranteed universal income.
[00:03:21.175 --> 00:03:22.195]  None of it's true.
[00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:38.187]  Now we have total evidence of election fraud coming out all across the country, and we have the media blackout on that, and the internet censorship, which we knew would come with this overthrow of Trump and our populist movement.
[00:03:40.188 --> 00:03:44.950]  And I can sit there and count coup all day and bitch about Trump and say, oh, see, we told you so, old man.
[00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:47.971]  You didn't stop all the censorship, so now you're in trouble.
[00:03:48.592 --> 00:03:49.612]  Well, that doesn't do anything.
[00:03:49.652 --> 00:03:51.893]  That's like cutting your nose off to spite your face.
[00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:52.954]  I'm just going to move on from that.
[00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.412]  Though we should point out to Republicans and the populace of the future, they should fight back.
[00:03:59.708 --> 00:04:02.829]  That's like fighting the last war instead of fighting the new war.
[00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.630]  I'm going to tell you what's coming next.
[00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.071]  The head of the British military gets it.
[00:04:06.091 --> 00:04:06.631]  The UK.
[00:04:06.691 --> 00:04:16.935]  It says global World War III, worldwide depression, economic collapse, collapse of the third world, hell on earth, is coming within a few months if the next lockdown happens.
[00:04:17.315 --> 00:04:20.696]  And Joe Biden and the UN and the EU have all announced it.
[00:04:20.936 --> 00:04:25.118]  There's one country that won't be locked down, and that's our boss, Xi Jinping.
[00:04:37.731 --> 00:04:47.474]  Well, this morning I talked to my oldest daughter and my wife at breakfast while my three-year-old daughter played toy cars in blocks on the floor and I prepared them both for what was happening.
[00:04:48.454 --> 00:04:55.836]  Both my wife and my oldest daughter finished my sentences before I could even complete them and they looked at me and they said, we know you're right.
[00:04:56.536 --> 00:04:57.677]  We're ready and we understand.
[00:04:57.697 --> 00:05:01.918]  And it was a very good feeling, a feeling of strength.
[00:05:03.251 --> 00:05:05.653]  Because they weren't repeating things that have been drilled into their head.
[00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:10.636]  I'd never really pushed these things on them, but they'd been listening and they'd been checking and they knew the truth.
[00:05:11.096 --> 00:05:15.259]  My oldest daughter, Charlotte, looked at me and she said, Dad, you're almost always right.
[00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:17.280]  A little tear came out of her eye.
[00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:23.704]  And that meant so much to me when I gave them this speech at the breakfast table at 8 a.m.
[00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:24.144]  this morning.
[00:05:25.505 --> 00:05:26.446]  And I laid out the future.
[00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:29.047]  I told them we tried to stop what was coming.
[00:05:29.067 --> 00:05:31.529]  I told them what was coming next, and they understood.
[00:05:32.702 --> 00:05:35.504]  They began to tell me things I hadn't even thought of that were dead on.
[00:05:37.505 --> 00:05:39.226]  And so this is going to be a lot easier now.
[00:05:39.246 --> 00:05:42.528]  Because the enemy is going to be right out in the open.
[00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.452]  But for all the yuppies and all the trendies and all those that have signed on to Satan.
[00:05:50.174 --> 00:06:00.677]  As things get worse and worse, they will only submit more and more, hoping that things get better if they just give up all their rights and try to force us to submit to them.
[00:06:01.437 --> 00:06:02.677]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[00:06:03.438 --> 00:06:04.538]  It is Sunday, November 8th.
[00:06:04.558 --> 00:06:05.118]  The year is 2020.
[00:06:05.258 --> 00:06:12.300]  And I come to you under blood-red skies and under true crisis.
[00:06:15.268 --> 00:06:40.403]  I have in front of me, no less than conservatively, as I counted them up this afternoon, 300 different articles with election officials, postal service workers, lawyers, law enforcement, confirming total, systematic, absolute, complete fraud in the five key battleground states we're told that President Trump has lost.
[00:06:42.659 --> 00:07:04.667]  And we can sit there and talk about those issues all day, but the system put in their censorship, put in their control, and now when the President gives a speech, or when Rudolph Giuliani gives a speech, or when Corey Lewandowski gives a speech, the only place it is is Infowars.com and right-side broadcasting.
[00:07:06.228 --> 00:07:09.569]  The other Patriot sites don't even really have live coverage.
[00:07:11.107 --> 00:07:13.068]  And so we have our audiences and that's it.
[00:07:13.188 --> 00:07:23.473]  Now, as things get serious, we have more viewers yesterday and today, per hour, over a million people on the audio and video streams than we did during election day.
[00:07:24.493 --> 00:07:25.314]  But you'd expect that.
[00:07:25.854 --> 00:07:31.537]  I told you Trump was going to win, but they'd freeze the states and bring in mail-in ballots because Democrats said
[00:07:32.956 --> 00:07:34.177]  It's a red mirage.
[00:07:34.737 --> 00:07:36.278]  He'll look like he won that day.
[00:07:36.498 --> 00:07:40.620]  We're going to freeze the voting, and then we're going to count the ballots that came in, and Trump will lose.
[00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:42.841]  And Pelosi said he will lose.
[00:07:43.122 --> 00:07:47.184]  She said, we'll do whatever we do on whatever that thing is, Election Day.
[00:07:47.904 --> 00:07:50.526]  And then, by inauguration, he'll be the president.
[00:07:53.287 --> 00:07:56.309]  You know, Google has a big article that's up on Infowars.com.
[00:07:56.829 --> 00:07:58.130]  Google Analytics.
[00:07:59.707 --> 00:08:06.710]  And they had a record search in the days before the election and the days after the election that no one ever searches.
[00:08:08.851 --> 00:08:09.932]  What is the penalty?
[00:08:11.052 --> 00:08:11.913]  Was one of the searches.
[00:08:11.993 --> 00:08:13.313]  And what is the consequences?
[00:08:13.854 --> 00:08:15.214]  And what is the prison time?
[00:08:15.274 --> 00:08:16.315]  And what is the jail time?
[00:08:16.655 --> 00:08:18.876]  These are searches no one's ever done.
[00:08:18.896 --> 00:08:22.718]  But now it was by the thousands per state.
[00:08:23.996 --> 00:08:41.400]  In Pennsylvania, in Georgia, in Minnesota, in Wisconsin, in Michigan, the search was for what is the consequences, what is the penalty, what is the prison time for election fraud.
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.401]  Wow, because that's election officials in fraud, not voter fraud.
[00:08:49.892 --> 00:08:50.292]  There it is.
[00:08:50.332 --> 00:08:50.873]  Scroll up.
[00:08:50.953 --> 00:08:55.898]  Google trend searches for election fraud punishment surge in the key battleground states.
[00:08:56.338 --> 00:08:57.139]  It's not just those.
[00:08:57.199 --> 00:08:57.739]  More's come out.
[00:08:59.521 --> 00:09:03.305]  That is people checking to see what's going to happen to them.
[00:09:05.947 --> 00:09:07.369]  You put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[00:09:10.852 --> 00:09:12.373]  And I've got stacks of those articles.
[00:09:13.314 --> 00:09:14.715]  Felt like a drug deal.
[00:09:15.845 --> 00:09:21.991]  Asian-American ballot observer in Detroit describes mysterious van dropping off 61 boxes of ballots at 4 a.m.
[00:09:22.071 --> 00:09:24.193]  illegally after the polls had closed.
[00:09:26.456 --> 00:09:27.737]  Trying to share that on Facebook?
[00:09:28.237 --> 00:09:29.679]  You're banned in two seconds flat.
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.002]  You see, Trump now has had his legs cut out from under him.
[00:09:33.383 --> 00:09:39.529]  They'll let Lou Dobbs defend him on Fox Business with very small viewership compared to Fox.
[00:09:42.534 --> 00:09:43.794]  But none of it's on Fox.
[00:09:43.874 --> 00:09:45.635]  It's all Trump needs to concede.
[00:09:46.115 --> 00:09:47.836]  George W. Bush needs to concede.
[00:09:48.576 --> 00:09:54.678]  And when I come back from break, I'm going to explain what they're saying to the President inside the White House right now.
[00:09:55.578 --> 00:09:56.799]  And how they're trying to get him to concede.
[00:09:56.839 --> 00:09:58.079]  But let me just say this right now.
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:06.542]  If Trump concedes, they're going to blame him for the COVID-19 deaths.
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:18.951]  They're going to set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission to demonize all of his supporters, and they're going to make the lockdown and the shutdown of our economy ten times worse, and now Biden's announced that.
[00:10:19.351 --> 00:10:24.457]  All these conservatives are like, well, Alex... I saw my neighbor yesterday.
[00:10:24.497 --> 00:10:30.283]  He goes... He goes, Alex... He goes, at least...
[00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.811]  At least they'll turn the economy back on.
[00:10:36.831 --> 00:10:38.431]  And I said, no, they're not going to.
[00:10:39.171 --> 00:10:43.412]  I showed him on my phone where Biden's new commission says it'll never open.
[00:10:43.672 --> 00:10:43.892]  Ever.
[00:10:44.333 --> 00:10:44.513]  Ever.
[00:10:45.793 --> 00:10:45.973]  Ever.
[00:10:47.794 --> 00:10:52.315]  You think these control freaks are ever going to turn loose once this dog has you in its jaws?
[00:10:53.055 --> 00:10:54.795]  Once this great white shark's got you in its mouth?
[00:10:54.875 --> 00:10:55.316]  Come on.
[00:10:56.636 --> 00:10:59.437]  Oh, Joe Biden wants peace and love and wants us all to heal.
[00:11:00.177 --> 00:11:01.317]  Everything he says is a lie.
[00:11:01.557 --> 00:11:03.618]  He said, I want to ban all fossil fuels.
[00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.842]  And all fracking on all these videos, and then Trump says you want to ban it.
[00:11:07.862 --> 00:11:08.643]  He goes, I never said that.
[00:11:08.663 --> 00:11:09.323]  You're a liar.
[00:11:10.004 --> 00:11:11.025]  Even though it's all on video.
[00:11:12.045 --> 00:11:13.326]  He said, I'll never take your guns.
[00:11:13.386 --> 00:11:14.627]  Now he says, I want to ban all guns.
[00:11:17.549 --> 00:11:23.213]  But when it comes to following orders from the UN and Bill Gates and the CHICOMS, he 100% follows those orders.
[00:11:23.493 --> 00:11:27.156]  And I've got what he's released, and what he says starts Monday.
[00:11:27.476 --> 00:11:31.479]  They'll be announcing by Tuesday the way to drive Trump from office.
[00:11:31.499 --> 00:11:32.600]  It's going to work just like this.
[00:11:33.786 --> 00:11:34.747]  I'll cover it next segment.
[00:11:36.369 --> 00:11:37.611]  Trump got all those people killed.
[00:11:39.052 --> 00:11:46.681]  He needs to be removed by the 25th Amendment by his cabinet 70 something days before he's supposed to go.
[00:11:48.208 --> 00:12:02.060]  If he doesn't agree to implement contact tracers, checkpoints, endless lockdowns, national mask mandate, and they'll say to Trump, if you approve this, we will say it's not your fault, COVID, which wasn't his fault.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:08.826]  It was the CHICOMS, the EU, the UN, Bill Gates, Fauci, the Wuhan lab, that all came out.
[00:12:09.830 --> 00:12:14.594]  And if Trump does that and makes a deal, they'll break that deal before he's even gone.
[00:12:15.074 --> 00:12:22.480]  The minute he comes out and says, fine, I'll implement your next lockdown and he sues for peace, they're not going to give Trump peace.
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:30.726]  They want to destroy him and imprison him in front of the world to discredit his supporters and to basically make us bow down.
[00:12:30.806 --> 00:12:31.927]  But we cannot do that.
[00:12:33.646 --> 00:12:41.710]  I've already been through this with, I've said billions of things and they take a few things out of context and say it's my identity and say Jones lives off this.
[00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:43.310]  Jones identity is Sandy Hook.
[00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.151]  Jones money comes from, I barely even ever talked about Sandy Hook.
[00:12:46.532 --> 00:12:47.792]  And they're always like, don't let him on air.
[00:12:47.812 --> 00:12:49.013]  He's going to say no kids died.
[00:12:49.033 --> 00:12:50.293]  He's going to harass the children.
[00:12:50.613 --> 00:12:51.154]  All made up.
[00:12:52.534 --> 00:12:53.215]  Well, they say about Trump.
[00:12:53.355 --> 00:12:54.855]  Oh, he's a COVID-19 guy.
[00:12:55.115 --> 00:12:56.056]  It's the Trump virus.
[00:12:57.182 --> 00:13:02.170]  And then they're going to use that every election to shut the economy back down and decide what businesses can operate.
[00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.493]  And the businesses will all dutifully stay shut down.
[00:13:05.074 --> 00:13:10.542]  And now Joe Biden and Rahm Emanuel have come out and said, learn to code!
[00:13:11.598 --> 00:13:13.258]  You're never going to have a small business again.
[00:13:13.759 --> 00:13:15.799]  Only big corporations are allowed to stay open.
[00:13:16.559 --> 00:13:18.340]  And the big corporations have unlimited financing.
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.581]  They'll do the social distancing and the lockdowns for years.
[00:13:22.561 --> 00:13:26.742]  Until you're all out of business, and then they'll turn back on and they're the only service economy.
[00:13:26.942 --> 00:13:33.364]  But to go to them, you've got to have an app, with a phone, with a tracker system for a grocery store, a restaurant, a movie theater.
[00:13:33.404 --> 00:13:34.244]  They admit all this.
[00:13:34.524 --> 00:13:36.785]  It's the social credit score AI takeover.
[00:13:38.561 --> 00:13:43.342]  And the British Ministry of Defense has now come out and admitted that and said this is part of a robot takeover.
[00:13:43.362 --> 00:13:44.522]  I've got the article right here.
[00:13:45.342 --> 00:13:46.882]  But I'm not going to just tell you what's coming next.
[00:13:47.603 --> 00:13:49.063]  I'm going to tell you how to stop it.
[00:13:50.303 --> 00:13:52.063]  I'm going to tell you how to stop it straight ahead.
[00:13:52.503 --> 00:13:53.704]  Infowars.com.
[00:13:53.744 --> 00:13:54.924]  Tomorrow it's news today.
[00:13:58.405 --> 00:14:04.206]  You know, you'd think that when I got a lot of desperate calls from the White House in the last few days, it'd make my ego feel big.
[00:14:05.766 --> 00:14:06.646]  Made me feel pathetic.
[00:14:08.311 --> 00:14:12.893]  That I'm one of the few people that has the deep knowledge of the whole overall globalist attack.
[00:14:13.854 --> 00:14:20.397]  And that we failed in the last four years to actually get Trump on the exact right track on how to beat these people.
[00:14:21.958 --> 00:14:30.362]  Trump overrode four previous coup attempts, but because he couldn't punish the coup plotters, it only made their next attacks more bold.
[00:14:32.253 --> 00:14:42.677]  And if they succeed in this coup plot, all the liberals are like calling everyone they know, texting everyone they know, family they haven't talked to in years, and they're saying, listen, we want to be friends.
[00:14:42.717 --> 00:14:43.938]  Just stay in your houses.
[00:14:44.758 --> 00:14:45.539]  Just submit.
[00:14:47.279 --> 00:14:48.340]  Biden's going to be nice.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:50.821]  Oh, he's going to be real nice.
[00:14:51.721 --> 00:14:55.763]  America is the prize to collapse, to then dictate our full surrender.
[00:14:56.923 --> 00:15:00.945]  Hillary was already planning to collapse the economy and run the COVID scam years ago.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:03.241]  It was all pre-packaged, pre-prepared.
[00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:03.841]  That's been admitted.
[00:15:04.842 --> 00:15:05.302]  Lockstep.
[00:15:06.163 --> 00:15:06.863]  Event 201.
[00:15:07.944 --> 00:15:10.925]  But when Trump got in, it kind of messed it all up, but they still launched the attack.
[00:15:13.327 --> 00:15:17.069]  And it's meant to bring us down so they can consolidate power and control over us.
[00:15:17.089 --> 00:15:23.473]  And you've seen big tech basically double its profits in just the last year under this scam.
[00:15:25.014 --> 00:15:26.415]  This is about conquering you.
[00:15:26.515 --> 00:15:29.897]  They don't want anybody that has wealth that isn't them.
[00:15:29.937 --> 00:15:31.258]  They don't want a middle class.
[00:15:32.875 --> 00:15:34.295]  The social contract is broken.
[00:15:36.636 --> 00:15:40.798]  And I drove around Austin, Texas yesterday, and the black folks I all saw weren't flipping me off.
[00:15:40.818 --> 00:15:45.819]  They were waving and looked upset and really angry, because they know their lives have gotten better the last four years.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:50.681]  But the white yuppies and some of the Hispanics were saying, we're going to kill you.
[00:15:50.741 --> 00:15:51.621]  You're going to prison.
[00:15:51.661 --> 00:15:52.422]  We have it on video.
[00:15:52.842 --> 00:15:53.502]  Flipping us off.
[00:15:53.542 --> 00:15:54.942]  Just absolutely brainwashed.
[00:15:56.883 --> 00:16:00.764]  Imagining that they work for the system, when they're really just useful idiots.
[00:16:00.804 --> 00:16:02.385]  But let's go ahead and lay it out right now.
[00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:12.667]  Owen Troyer, starting tomorrow, is going to launch a caravan that's going to leave at 5 p.m.
[00:16:12.707 --> 00:16:31.641]  from a location we're going to announce, and it's going to drive to Houston and then along the Gulf of Mexico border through Louisiana, Mississippi, into Florida, where it will turn north into Georgia, and will go up through the Carolinas into Virginia, where I will meet it in D.C.
[00:16:32.421 --> 00:16:33.142]  on Friday.
[00:16:34.892 --> 00:16:43.198]  And we're going to call for others to launch caravans around the nation, in the Midwest, in the South, and in the East Coast to D.C.
[00:16:43.278 --> 00:16:46.880]  Truckers are already announcing big strikes they're going to have, takeover of D.C.
[00:16:46.921 --> 00:16:47.721]  this next weekend.
[00:16:49.042 --> 00:16:51.344]  So don't worry, President Trump, the cavalry's coming.
[00:16:52.164 --> 00:16:56.327]  If you're on the West Coast, we're going to announce days and times.
[00:16:56.467 --> 00:16:59.770]  We're looking for leaders to do it who will show up at the big tech heads.
[00:17:00.762 --> 00:17:08.790]  They're outside San Francisco in protest at the real enemy who has shut down the communication systems and who helps run the death camps in Communist China.
[00:17:09.711 --> 00:17:12.613]  We Americans will show up on the West Coast, but people are fired up, they're ready.
[00:17:13.638 --> 00:17:20.641]  And because all the other sites have been shut down, InfoWars again has record traffic, record people coming, looking for leadership, and we're not going to desert you at this time.
[00:17:21.021 --> 00:17:22.042]  We're going to give you that leadership.
[00:17:22.062 --> 00:17:24.623]  I don't know what the enemy's going to do to us, but that's just fine.
[00:17:24.663 --> 00:17:25.603]  I'm here to take my licks.
[00:17:25.623 --> 00:17:26.564]  That's how it is.
[00:17:27.284 --> 00:17:27.884]  Part of being a man.
[00:17:27.924 --> 00:17:29.325]  In fact, I look forward to it.
[00:17:29.345 --> 00:17:39.049]  I'm not into pain, but if pain gets me where I'm going, I will certainly accept it, and I will take it, and it's up to God to mete out how much of this I put up with.
[00:17:39.089 --> 00:17:42.131]  But I put my faith and deliver myself into the hands of Christ.
[00:17:43.314 --> 00:17:44.175]  As the good book says.
[00:17:46.576 --> 00:17:51.278]  Now, here's my message to President Trump.
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:56.901]  President Trump, you cannot concede because it's not just about you.
[00:17:57.942 --> 00:18:03.005]  There has been systemic, organized election fraud in all of these key battleground states.
[00:18:03.025 --> 00:18:03.965]  They've been caught red-handed.
[00:18:04.005 --> 00:18:04.605]  It's all admitted.
[00:18:05.506 --> 00:18:09.108]  The corporate media, with no evidence, called you a Russian agent, said that you stole the election.
[00:18:10.174 --> 00:18:14.797]  Spent three-plus years prosecuting a fraud, illegally surveilling you, and found nothing.
[00:18:15.638 --> 00:18:21.202]  Meanwhile, Biden, the Clintons, the Obamas are up to their eyeballs with the Russians, the communists, Chinese, and anybody else that will pay them.
[00:18:23.564 --> 00:18:30.849]  And now you have a responsibility to stand up for the majority that voted for you and the American people that love you and support you.
[00:18:30.869 --> 00:18:32.190]  And I see you doing that.
[00:18:33.031 --> 00:18:38.935]  I know you're surrounded by career politicians and a lot of weak members of your family, other than folks like
[00:18:40.236 --> 00:18:54.292]  Junior, who want to parlay your destruction into their next job, and who want the angel of New World Order death to pass over them, when the mere association with you will ensure they're going to be betrayed.
[00:18:54.713 --> 00:18:57.055]  They don't have real leadership qualities.
[00:18:58.557 --> 00:19:01.080]  If it's true that Jared came to you and asked you to concede.
[00:19:03.368 --> 00:19:05.870]  It is very disheartening and very concerning.
[00:19:06.330 --> 00:19:09.372]  I understand you need to get focused and get zenned out and take a break.
[00:19:09.392 --> 00:19:14.075]  I'm not against that, but to see that you're playing golf every day and not making statements.
[00:19:15.056 --> 00:19:20.200]  It'd be one thing if you were playing golf in the morning and then in the afternoon at the Resolute desk.
[00:19:21.437 --> 00:19:42.774]  Laying out all the fraud that the Gateway Pundit, and that Red State, and that Daily Caller, and that Breitbart, and InfoWars have been doing, and all the witnesses, and the law enforcement, and the poll watchers, and the lawyers, and your own ambassador, who her vote wasn't counted and her dead husband's vote was sent.
[00:19:43.919 --> 00:19:50.562]  Just the orgy of just today, over 300 articles I read, and I go and check the numbers, it's true.
[00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:57.004]  I mean, 600 plus thousand votes counted that were all Joe Biden's in these states.
[00:19:57.624 --> 00:20:01.206]  We're 20,000 here, 50,000 there, 10,000 here, 6,000 there.
[00:20:01.646 --> 00:20:09.569]  Totaling up to 600,000 plus ballots came in that were only for Joe Biden with no other Trump votes.
[00:20:10.069 --> 00:20:11.010]  That's arrogance!
[00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:15.672]  The criminal ballot box stuffers didn't want to mix a few real Trumps in.
[00:20:16.132 --> 00:20:18.014]  They wanted to get the bare minimum in for fraud.
[00:20:21.636 --> 00:20:23.157]  And that's what the graphs show.
[00:20:25.798 --> 00:20:31.742]  The graphs show that it's a normal organic line.
[00:20:31.782 --> 00:20:32.302]  Trump's winning.
[00:20:32.883 --> 00:20:34.043]  They close the polls early.
[00:20:35.224 --> 00:20:39.547]  And then all of a sudden, a straight line goes up from Biden to complete the win.
[00:20:41.377 --> 00:20:47.679]  They didn't even hide it because they want to piss in our face and demoralize us and make us not want to vote the next election.
[00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:53.722]  Justice Department okays armed officers investigating fraud in ballot counting sites.
[00:20:53.742 --> 00:20:55.262]  Yeah, that's three days old, two days old.
[00:20:55.842 --> 00:20:56.803]  Now it's all confirmed.
[00:20:56.843 --> 00:20:58.023]  I'll cover it when we come back.
[00:20:59.444 --> 00:21:04.886]  And we've got so much to lay out and so much to break down today, but it is extremely powerful.
[00:21:05.959 --> 00:21:12.841]  Information, but it doesn't matter because on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, they're blocking all of it.
[00:21:14.762 --> 00:21:16.343]  As soon as something goes viral, they block it.
[00:21:16.923 --> 00:21:18.643]  They're blocking Fox News clips.
[00:21:18.663 --> 00:21:21.284]  They're blocking C-SPAN clips.
[00:21:21.564 --> 00:21:25.085]  They're blocking Giuliani speaking because this is their move.
[00:21:25.506 --> 00:21:28.407]  They got caught in all those other previous frauds.
[00:21:30.587 --> 00:21:31.668]  And now they don't know what to do.
[00:21:32.468 --> 00:21:34.989]  And so they waited the election with plausible deniability.
[00:21:35.836 --> 00:21:37.157]  And they launched this whole operation.
[00:21:39.419 --> 00:21:40.660]  The question is, what are we going to do?
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:47.266]  Well, if Trump concedes, they will always demonize him.
[00:21:48.967 --> 00:21:50.168]  Go ahead and scroll down.
[00:21:50.288 --> 00:21:51.389]  This means scroll down.
[00:21:51.429 --> 00:21:51.790]  Yeah, go ahead.
[00:21:51.810 --> 00:21:52.911]  Go ahead and scroll down.
[00:21:53.511 --> 00:21:54.132]  Show TV viewers.
[00:21:54.152 --> 00:21:54.612]  Yeah, there you go.
[00:21:55.633 --> 00:21:56.274]  You see those?
[00:21:56.354 --> 00:21:57.234]  Those are real graphs.
[00:21:57.435 --> 00:22:00.297]  Perfect straight ups till they go above Trump.
[00:22:01.018 --> 00:22:03.200]  I mean, it happened in Michigan.
[00:22:04.042 --> 00:22:05.143]  It happened in Wisconsin.
[00:22:05.563 --> 00:22:06.404]  It happened in Georgia.
[00:22:06.424 --> 00:22:07.445]  It happened in Pennsylvania.
[00:22:07.545 --> 00:22:17.914]  I mean, folks, the exact same graph, the exact same fraudulent voting machine company owned by George Soros, it turns out, and the Bushes, Harald Group, it's all coming off of Alex Jones.
[00:22:17.934 --> 00:22:20.456]  Tell everybody you know, tune in now to InfoWars.com.
[00:22:20.476 --> 00:22:22.718]  We're still on air, bigger than ever, at InfoWars.com.
[00:22:23.823 --> 00:22:29.226]  I was talking to Rob, one of our great producers and researchers, and I said, are you mad?
[00:22:29.306 --> 00:22:30.567]  And Alex Jones here back live.
[00:22:30.667 --> 00:22:32.048]  He said, man, I'm really mad.
[00:22:32.068 --> 00:22:33.769]  He said, I live in San Antonio.
[00:22:33.789 --> 00:22:35.770]  I was driving back up here today to Austin.
[00:22:35.811 --> 00:22:37.371]  He said, all I saw was Trump flags.
[00:22:38.092 --> 00:22:39.253]  All I saw was Trump vehicles.
[00:22:39.273 --> 00:22:40.093]  That's all I've seen.
[00:22:40.193 --> 00:22:42.315]  Black, white, Hispanic, you name it.
[00:22:42.395 --> 00:22:43.155]  It's just everywhere.
[00:22:43.235 --> 00:22:44.256]  No Joe Biden anywhere.
[00:22:45.485 --> 00:22:50.046]  And they tell us Trump lost, even though massive election fraud's coming out, all confirmed.
[00:22:50.526 --> 00:22:55.748]  You turn on national news, though, Fox, CNN, oh, there's no proof, it's ridiculous, he needs to step down.
[00:22:57.008 --> 00:22:59.249]  They tried these four previous coups that failed.
[00:22:59.829 --> 00:23:02.550]  The key is President Trump must not concede.
[00:23:03.190 --> 00:23:06.611]  Now, we've announced Owen Schroyer starting tomorrow morning.
[00:23:07.898 --> 00:23:14.003]  We cooked this up with some of our crew and also Ali Alexander is going to launch at 5 p.m.
[00:23:14.043 --> 00:23:17.826]  from a location we'll announce tomorrow during my show to start a caravan.
[00:23:18.887 --> 00:23:25.453]  And the point is the long haul from Austin, we decided the southern route down to Houston.
[00:23:25.473 --> 00:23:30.097]  They're going to stop either in Houston or a little bit further, maybe Beaumont.
[00:23:30.984 --> 00:23:48.360]  And then they're going to go all the way into Tallahassee, the capital of Florida, and they're going to turn up the next day and go all the way up to the capital of Georgia, Atlanta, and then right up to the Carolinas into D.C., and I'll be arriving the next day with Ali Alexander and a lot of other crew.
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.081]  I've got some other secret plans.
[00:23:50.141 --> 00:23:52.884]  I'm going to leave it at that, but believe me, we're working really hard.
[00:23:52.924 --> 00:23:53.784]  I've never worked this hard.
[00:23:54.105 --> 00:23:57.027]  I'm very pleased to be here, very thankful to be here, but it's a responsibility.
[00:23:57.868 --> 00:24:01.230]  Ali Alexander has not been doing interviews because he helped stop the steal.
[00:24:02.271 --> 00:24:05.954]  He first did it months and months ago, started the movement, knowing this was coming.
[00:24:06.814 --> 00:24:08.115]  And he's here to give us the latest numbers.
[00:24:08.155 --> 00:24:16.741]  But it's so critical, Ali, to not get the president to concede because the cavalry is coming and the evidence of fraud is mounting massively.
[00:24:16.841 --> 00:24:17.482]  Ali Alexander.
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:25.045]  We know that the President is watching these broadcasts, and so I want to say, Mr. President, the Calvary is coming.
[00:24:25.485 --> 00:24:36.394]  StopTheSteal.us is uniting everyone of all kinds of different stripes, all kinds of different persuasions, saying, we want a transparent election, not an opaque election.
[00:24:36.434 --> 00:24:38.836]  So give us a transparent election.
[00:24:39.236 --> 00:24:41.298]  And what Democrats are you hiding?
[00:24:41.358 --> 00:24:46.822]  Because it's only in states where there are Democrats governors and Democrats secretaries of states
[00:24:47.242 --> 00:24:51.507]  Are we really having the problems in most of these in these contests?
[00:24:51.527 --> 00:24:57.695]  So Alex, I just want to applaud you because look, you know, taxes under a Biden-Harris administration are going to go up.
[00:24:57.995 --> 00:25:05.144]  But people like you and me, we're selling our lives, our treasure and our sacred honor to try to stop this deal.
[00:25:07.421 --> 00:25:10.202]  I want to be clear, his taxes are meant to wreck the U.S.
[00:25:10.242 --> 00:25:13.383]  economy, all the big globalist billionaires that fund him are tax exempt offshore.
[00:25:13.823 --> 00:25:15.683]  But he's talking about a permanent lockdown.
[00:25:16.263 --> 00:25:20.705]  Cloward and Piven program, for those who don't know, is to bankrupt us to make us go into socialism.
[00:25:21.025 --> 00:25:26.806]  They want to break the American model, put us on a guaranteed universal income to dictate the way we live our lives.
[00:25:27.226 --> 00:25:30.527]  America is going into bondage right now under this Biden fraud.
[00:25:30.567 --> 00:25:31.387]  We must reject it.
[00:25:31.667 --> 00:25:36.689]  And finally, I see a little bit of a truthful headline out of Fox News, Republicans angry
[00:25:37.329 --> 00:25:38.029]  Right.
[00:25:38.049 --> 00:25:38.570]  It's not a Biden win.
[00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:44.892]  What people need to understand, the media is saying that if there are no court cases that favor Trump,
[00:25:55.669 --> 00:26:02.114]  Then this may be how the Secretary of State of these respective states certify the election.
[00:26:02.454 --> 00:26:05.717]  We're talking about a guess of a guess and it's stupid.
[00:26:05.777 --> 00:26:06.718]  It's irresponsible.
[00:26:07.098 --> 00:26:08.980]  Honestly, it should be against the law.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.421]  It should be totally against the law.
[00:26:10.681 --> 00:26:15.325]  We should regulate the media, keep open the First Amendment and free speech for the citizens.
[00:26:15.365 --> 00:26:16.586]  But these corporate powers
[00:26:17.126 --> 00:26:20.831]  Have totally broken democracy and I don't say that lightly.
[00:26:20.891 --> 00:26:22.533]  They have broken democracy.
[00:26:22.833 --> 00:26:25.797]  We are not going to be able to come together after this.
[00:26:26.017 --> 00:26:31.664]  What we are choosing is who will have the state powers, who will have control of the state.
[00:26:31.964 --> 00:26:33.506]  Will it be Donald J. Trump
[00:26:34.299 --> 00:26:38.443]  Or the cabal that is putting up this empty vessel, Joe Biden.
[00:26:38.643 --> 00:26:41.326]  And I gotta tell you, I'm not safe in that environment.
[00:26:41.646 --> 00:26:43.268]  You're not safe in that environment.
[00:26:43.468 --> 00:26:45.970]  They make lists of people who watch this show.
[00:26:46.391 --> 00:26:48.753]  You're not safe, listener, in that environment.
[00:26:48.773 --> 00:26:51.956]  So we all need to take to the streets and say we want a transparent election.
[00:26:52.496 --> 00:26:54.598]  Or, we gotta stop this country from moving.
[00:26:55.059 --> 00:26:55.599]  Peacefully.
[00:26:55.619 --> 00:26:56.180]  Obviously.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:56.660]  Well that's right.
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.621]  For those that don't know,
[00:26:58.582 --> 00:27:00.583]  Even under the UN's own rules, which they love to quote,
[00:27:29.943 --> 00:27:31.523]  We've got damning evidence.
[00:27:31.563 --> 00:27:32.704]  We've got him dead to rights.
[00:27:33.004 --> 00:27:37.806]  The audacity was that he got to shake Hunter Biden in our faces on stage last night.
[00:27:38.306 --> 00:27:40.807]  I mean, they know that the coup has worked.
[00:27:41.187 --> 00:27:43.848]  They know that the sigh up on the American people has worked.
[00:27:44.228 --> 00:27:46.209]  They know that censorship has worked.
[00:27:46.569 --> 00:27:48.510]  They think that you're a coward.
[00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:49.151]  Okay?
[00:27:49.351 --> 00:27:51.091]  They think we're all cowards.
[00:27:51.411 --> 00:27:53.932]  And I'm here to let them know you can arrest me.
[00:27:54.433 --> 00:27:55.213]  You can hurt me.
[00:27:55.213 --> 00:27:56.013]  We're good to go.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:25.324]  Alex, all of Joe Biden's announcements today were about the Paris Climate Accord, giving Iran some more money, and then working with the Chinese.
[00:28:25.604 --> 00:28:28.045]  He's obviously a globalist.
[00:28:28.365 --> 00:28:30.145]  He's obviously a globalist.
[00:28:30.466 --> 00:28:33.347]  And they are seeking to rape and pillage America.
[00:28:33.627 --> 00:28:34.367]  You and me.
[00:28:34.607 --> 00:28:36.708]  There's not going to be a US dollar.
[00:28:36.948 --> 00:28:39.089]  There's not going to be a US border.
[00:28:39.369 --> 00:28:44.534]  We're not going to be able to get the supplies that we have relied on in normal America.
[00:28:44.594 --> 00:28:47.537]  He's going to lock us down, and that's going to become the new norm.
[00:28:47.557 --> 00:28:49.318]  And I'm telling you, I won't live in that world.
[00:28:49.478 --> 00:28:50.659]  They will have to wipe me out.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.580]  I'm not even kidding.
[00:28:52.922 --> 00:28:54.403]  Well, I'm glad you raised that point.
[00:28:54.443 --> 00:28:57.986]  We'll play the clip in a moment, or maybe we'll just play the whole Biden speech next segment.
[00:28:58.006 --> 00:28:59.147]  That's probably the easiest way to show it.
[00:28:59.648 --> 00:29:01.550]  But he leads his evil crackhead.
[00:29:02.611 --> 00:29:17.824]  Chinese communist, Russian spy's son, on video, on audio, admitting it all, Biden's bragged about how he's a foreign agent, onto the stage in front of everybody, with this baby in his arms, when he's a known pervert, and they just throw that in our face.
[00:29:17.864 --> 00:29:18.685]  I mean, this is insane.
[00:29:18.925 --> 00:29:21.627]  He's been in hiding for months, and they throw this in our face.
[00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:25.671]  Yeah, what they're saying is that the media controls you.
[00:29:26.314 --> 00:29:28.054]  They're saying that the media controls you.
[00:29:28.335 --> 00:29:30.455]  And Fox News is in on the game.
[00:29:30.875 --> 00:29:34.956]  You know, Alex, your listeners are pretty educated, so they'll probably know this.
[00:29:35.256 --> 00:29:47.340]  When you buy that cable package because, oh, I got a favorite show on this channel or that channel, and Alex, I did hear you bragging about watching some show or whatever, a portion of that bill goes to CNN.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:59.904]  So if you're buying the cable package and you're paying $60 a month, CNN is making $3 of that a month whether or not you subscribe to them or not, or you watch them or not.
[00:30:00.185 --> 00:30:04.186]  We've got to decide that the media is the problem.
[00:30:04.286 --> 00:30:06.427]  How we know what we know is the problem.
[00:30:06.687 --> 00:30:10.688]  And for Joe Biden to have the audacity, that's how we know he's the evil godfather figure.
[00:30:11.009 --> 00:30:14.370]  Because he had the audacity to shove it in our faces.
[00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:27.635]  By the way, there's a new Atlantic Monthly article, I'm not joking, I had it out there, I left it in my office, where it says, Biden fondling your child is like Christ touching you, and it's a holy act that heals the nation.
[00:30:27.655 --> 00:30:28.155]  Did you see that?
[00:30:28.945 --> 00:30:29.846]  No, I did not see that.
[00:30:29.906 --> 00:30:31.367]  That, I mean, it would not surprise me.
[00:30:31.407 --> 00:30:39.393]  These people, they're perverts and they're seeking to, you and I have talked about this, invert, invert all of these holy orders that we have.
[00:30:39.814 --> 00:30:46.619]  That Christianity stabilized this, this feral version of, of what Rome had, you know, after it burned and all this.
[00:30:46.839 --> 00:30:53.004]  Christianity injected into Western civilization a stabilizing formula.
[00:30:53.084 --> 00:30:55.326]  And then Western civilization didn't work until he had it.
[00:30:56.386 --> 00:30:57.047]  Exactly!
[00:30:57.107 --> 00:31:03.472]  So the basis of what we call Western Civilization now is Christianity because prior Western Civilization didn't work.
[00:31:03.752 --> 00:31:14.902]  And what Joe Biden and George Soros and Marina Abramovic and Lady Gaga and Jay-Z and all these people are doing is they're seeking to find these things that we find holy and then pervert them.
[00:31:15.742 --> 00:31:19.365]  Unless the nature of Satanism is to invert Christianity because they want the power.
[00:31:19.846 --> 00:31:21.967]  All right, Ali Alexander, great job.
[00:31:21.987 --> 00:31:27.812]  We're going to be announcing with maps and everything tomorrow the big caravan with an RV and the armored vehicle.
[00:31:27.872 --> 00:31:29.674]  I think tens of thousands of vehicles should join us.
[00:31:29.954 --> 00:31:31.735]  Truck drivers are planning to shut down D.C.
[00:31:31.775 --> 00:31:32.476]  coming up this week.
[00:31:32.816 --> 00:31:33.857]  We've only begun to fight.
[00:31:34.177 --> 00:31:35.598]  The cavalry is coming for the president.
[00:31:35.678 --> 00:31:37.480]  Do not concede President Trump.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:38.721]  Ali Alexander, thank you so much.
[00:31:39.782 --> 00:31:40.723]  You are the resistance.
[00:31:41.459 --> 00:31:42.099]  We'll be right back.
[00:31:42.199 --> 00:31:46.102]  I'm going to go over the election numbers and so much more in the next segment.
[00:31:46.122 --> 00:31:47.182]  Please spread the word, folks.
[00:31:47.302 --> 00:31:48.643]  Only way we get out is you spread the word.
[00:31:54.907 --> 00:31:56.688]  I always knew world government was coming.
[00:31:57.308 --> 00:32:03.172]  I always knew they'd use a bio-weapon attack as the cover for it, because they told us they would.
[00:32:03.652 --> 00:32:06.353]  I made documentaries about it and predicted it all.
[00:32:07.054 --> 00:32:08.975]  But now, we're here.
[00:32:11.914 --> 00:32:23.678]  And who would have ever imagined that we would have had a president fighting it, who had turned around the economy and rolled back so much of their fraud and had all these peace deals and ended all these wars.
[00:32:26.779 --> 00:32:29.420]  And that they would then have a fraudulent election and reject him.
[00:32:31.181 --> 00:32:36.642]  And then put in a weird corpse that says he's his grandma, he's his wife, he's his son, he's his daughter.
[00:32:37.103 --> 00:32:41.284]  Doesn't know who he is and brings his crackhead Chinese communist son up on stage with him.
[00:32:43.166 --> 00:32:44.506]  But they didn't wear their mask for that.
[00:32:44.847 --> 00:32:47.387]  They wore them before it, but oh, when they want to, they take them off.
[00:32:47.828 --> 00:32:48.968]  It's all sick!
[00:32:51.269 --> 00:32:58.211]  And to see all these domesticated slaves living off the blood, the sweat, the toil of men and women that fought for their freedom disgusts me.
[00:32:58.231 --> 00:33:01.872]  A lot of folks go, well, then let these idiots learn.
[00:33:02.592 --> 00:33:05.773]  Letting a bunch of dumb idiots get run over and be slaves doesn't make us free.
[00:33:06.594 --> 00:33:08.674]  I take no pleasure watching idiots get conned.
[00:33:08.714 --> 00:33:10.235]  I take no pleasure watching them die.
[00:33:11.567 --> 00:33:12.887]  Their ignorance is our weakness.
[00:33:15.688 --> 00:33:20.450]  In fact, beginning to hate the slaves, because I used to be a slave too, is the beginning of the end.
[00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:26.312]  Because then you become the globalists who decide, let's not try to empower people, let's dumb them down on purpose.
[00:33:27.272 --> 00:33:30.673]  Because humanity's bad enough when we're falling.
[00:33:32.042 --> 00:33:33.203]  Devil even takes us lower.
[00:33:33.643 --> 00:33:34.603]  Let's play a few of these clips.
[00:33:35.364 --> 00:33:39.746]  Here's Biden two months ago saying, we've got the most people ever for election fraud.
[00:33:39.766 --> 00:33:43.788]  And then Pelosi a week and a half ago saying, I don't care what happens with this thing coming up.
[00:33:44.629 --> 00:33:46.010]  He'll be inaugurated after.
[00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:49.351]  And they told us they'd do it with the ballots, and they did it.
[00:33:49.371 --> 00:33:52.073]  Because if there was one thing criminals do, they love to brag.
[00:33:52.513 --> 00:33:55.355]  Only time they tell the truth is when they're telling you how they're effing you over.
[00:33:55.415 --> 00:33:55.775]  Here it is.
[00:33:56.761 --> 00:34:07.311]  Secondly, we're in a situation where we have put together, and you guys did it for the President Obama's administration before this.
[00:34:07.892 --> 00:34:20.343]  We have put together, I think, the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.
[00:34:22.105 --> 00:34:22.926]  But we are ready.
[00:34:24.372 --> 00:34:28.835]  I feel very confident that Joe Biden will be elected president on Tuesday.
[00:34:29.896 --> 00:34:37.081]  Whatever the end count is, but on the election that occurs on Tuesday, he will be elected.
[00:34:37.181 --> 00:34:41.204]  On January 20th, he will be inaugurated president of the United States.
[00:34:43.866 --> 00:34:50.751]  She's the one that goes to the salon that's going bankrupt, doesn't wear a mask, gets caught not wearing a... Oh, but for the TV, she wears it up there on the stage.
[00:34:51.781 --> 00:34:54.203]  A symbol of she's dirty, she's bad, COVID's deadly.
[00:34:54.663 --> 00:34:55.223]  Oh my gosh.
[00:34:55.423 --> 00:34:56.344]  Oh, it's all Trump's fault.
[00:34:56.424 --> 00:34:56.724]  Oh yeah.
[00:34:57.104 --> 00:35:03.208]  America has, America's 4% of the world population, but we're 30% of the COVID cases.
[00:35:03.328 --> 00:35:03.989]  BS!
[00:35:04.889 --> 00:35:07.731]  Other countries don't, but don't worry, Biden has a new plan.
[00:35:07.951 --> 00:35:10.053]  Everyone will be tested under government law.
[00:35:10.533 --> 00:35:16.617]  You'll all be tested for COVID and you'll be disappeared off to a COVID center because the tests are false.
[00:35:18.032 --> 00:35:19.313]  How do they come and take us away to jail?
[00:35:19.513 --> 00:35:20.273]  Well, you know, I learned it.
[00:35:20.453 --> 00:35:23.354]  Just like Australia, just like Spain, just like Scotland.
[00:35:23.374 --> 00:35:24.354]  I got the articles right here.
[00:35:24.374 --> 00:35:26.875]  I'll cover it next hour.
[00:35:26.895 --> 00:35:28.776]  This is the police state.
[00:35:29.637 --> 00:35:35.079]  But the accomplished attorney and lawyer for General Flynn, Sidney Powell,
[00:35:36.058 --> 00:35:39.222]  Join Fox News host to talk about some of the latest info.
[00:35:39.502 --> 00:35:40.564]  The number's now over 600,000.
[00:35:40.944 --> 00:35:44.108]  This was a day ago, but it's on gatewaypundit.com.
[00:35:44.669 --> 00:35:50.636]  They've identified 450,000 ballots that miraculously only have a Joe Biden on them.
[00:35:50.917 --> 00:35:53.219]  I mean, literally, they'll come in by the hundreds of thousands, the 20,000s, all for Biden.
[00:35:55.981 --> 00:36:01.242]  They all come in, days later, they've already got federal courts and state courts saying, yeah, these ballots aren't good.
[00:36:01.543 --> 00:36:07.464]  If you remove the ballots that came in after the fact, Trump wins Pennsylvania, he wins Michigan, he wins Wisconsin, he wins Georgia.
[00:36:08.104 --> 00:36:08.705]  But they don't care.
[00:36:09.445 --> 00:36:12.906]  Because they're all having everyone announce that Trump is lost and he's a sore loser.
[00:36:13.346 --> 00:36:20.408]  If we give in to this hoax, we give in to the end of our electoral process and every fraud that comes after it, here is the Fox News report.
[00:36:20.888 --> 00:36:24.689]  Walk us through what has taken place here as you see it.
[00:36:26.744 --> 00:36:41.388]  Yes, there has been a massive and coordinated effort to steal this election from we, the people of the United States of America, to delegitimize and destroy votes for Donald Trump, to manufacture votes for Joe Biden.
[00:36:41.448 --> 00:36:54.691]  They have done it in every way imaginable, from having dead people vote in massive numbers to absolutely fraudulently creating ballots that exist only voting for Biden.
[00:36:55.151 --> 00:37:05.180]  We've identified at least 450,000 ballots in the key states that miraculously only have a mark for Joe Biden on them and no other candidate.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:11.845]  If you look at Florida, where things were done right, you can see that that's how the rest of the country should have gone.
[00:37:12.486 --> 00:37:16.990]  But they also used an algorithm to calculate the votes they would need to flip.
[00:37:17.330 --> 00:37:27.273]  And they used the computers to flip those votes from Biden, I mean from Trump to Biden and from other Republican candidates to their competitors also.
[00:37:27.293 --> 00:37:30.434]  I think Doug Collins had the race stolen from him.
[00:37:30.454 --> 00:37:33.875]  I think John James had his race stolen from him.
[00:37:34.335 --> 00:37:35.895]  It wasn't just President Trump.
[00:37:35.975 --> 00:37:37.996]  There were many people affected by this.
[00:37:38.456 --> 00:37:45.718]  We have got to fight tooth and nail in federal court to expose this abject fraud and the conspiracy behind it.
[00:37:46.318 --> 00:37:56.006]  Yeah, it's not just where they took the steel over the top.
[00:37:56.987 --> 00:38:00.309]  They thought they could do the steel and have Biden announce the victor that day.
[00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:05.974]  That was plan A. But if they couldn't, they'd freeze it, as we said, and then add the fraudulent votes in.
[00:38:07.793 --> 00:38:16.240]  The good news is Trump supporters, Trump candidates won the biggest landslide ever at state legislature level and they're going to change the laws.
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:28.210]  Texas, North Carolina, several other states threw out, I've got a whole stack of documents on that right here, I covered it yesterday on the Saturday Show, a whole stack of documents that prove
[00:38:30.131 --> 00:38:41.495]  That this Soros group is running this fraud, and all these states have thrown out and decertified this company, Staple Street, that's owned partly by Soros and the Bushes, and Mitt Romney.
[00:38:43.375 --> 00:38:46.456]  And they use this in third world countries too, as Staple Street's involved in that.
[00:38:47.357 --> 00:38:48.497]  So, that's what they did.
[00:38:49.337 --> 00:38:51.458]  And they think you're an idiot, they think you're a moron.
[00:38:53.328 --> 00:38:57.011]  And they have stolen things out in the open and now they just want Trump to concede.
[00:38:57.031 --> 00:38:58.212]  Don't have court.
[00:38:58.353 --> 00:38:59.313]  Don't investigate.
[00:38:59.353 --> 00:38:59.854]  Don't look.
[00:38:59.954 --> 00:39:01.776]  No, we're going to investigate.
[00:39:01.916 --> 00:39:02.636]  We're going to look.
[00:39:03.297 --> 00:39:04.418]  And we're going to burrow into it.
[00:39:04.438 --> 00:39:05.299]  We're going to expose you.
[00:39:05.319 --> 00:39:15.868]  And if you're crazy enough to steal this from us and put in the zombie crackhead communist agent, Hunter Biden's dad,
[00:39:17.153 --> 00:39:21.002]  Who got up on C-SPAN and said, yeah, I had the prosecutor fired.
[00:39:21.022 --> 00:39:22.104]  He was investigating my son.
[00:39:22.124 --> 00:39:24.329]  I said, you don't get the billion dollars, you don't fire him.
[00:39:24.369 --> 00:39:25.251]  Son of a bitch, they did.
[00:39:28.479 --> 00:39:49.133]  So they've got a big, big, big problem, because we're not going to concede, we're not going to roll over, we're not going to listen to that liar, Joe Biden, that he wants to be our buddy, while his surrogate, Michelle Obama, Big Mike, comes out and says all white people are the devil, and conservatives are the devil, and we all need to go to put in prison, and AOC says that
[00:39:50.034 --> 00:39:55.496]  We need to have reconciliation commissions where everybody associated with Trump is taken to jail until we say we're sorry.
[00:39:55.816 --> 00:39:58.216]  I mean, these people are out of control.
[00:39:58.836 --> 00:40:02.838]  And they failed their first four steals, and now they're pushing their latest one.
[00:40:02.858 --> 00:40:03.858]  But I'll say this real quick.
[00:40:06.759 --> 00:40:13.141]  Yeah, we'll play that next segment where Biden a year ago in Austin or San Antonio got exposed for his pedophile activity.
[00:40:13.161 --> 00:40:14.521]  That's coming up next segment, next hour.
[00:40:16.621 --> 00:40:18.082]  I'm not funded by George Soros.
[00:40:18.182 --> 00:40:19.642]  I'm not funded by the DNC.
[00:40:19.682 --> 00:40:22.743]  I'm not funded by Lord Rothschild or the Rockefellers or Bill Gates.
[00:40:22.783 --> 00:40:23.684]  I'm funded by you.
[00:40:24.904 --> 00:40:25.845]  And I need your support.
[00:40:25.885 --> 00:40:26.445]  I need your help.
[00:40:27.105 --> 00:40:32.767]  We have t-shirts, books, films, incredibly high quality supplements, nutraceuticals that fund our operation.
[00:40:32.908 --> 00:40:38.570]  And we've had an extra 10 million people on the live streams in the last six days.
[00:40:39.585 --> 00:40:41.406]  And I got to pay for it all, I'm not bitching, it's just true.
[00:40:41.947 --> 00:40:44.989]  And the money's running out of our bank accounts so quick it makes my head spin.
[00:40:45.389 --> 00:40:53.434]  And I'm going to pay to have that caravan go to the East Coast, and I'm going to pay to fly up there with my crew, and I'm going to pay for it all, no matter what happens, I'll put it in God's hands.
[00:40:53.474 --> 00:41:03.601]  But listen, all the new audience tuning in, tell folks about InfoWars.com, tell folks about NewsWars.com, tell them about Band.Video, share the link on your email, because all I want to do is reach new people.
[00:41:04.381 --> 00:41:11.154]  And then keep this last beacon of truth as all the other systems get shut down on air with the big tech censorship.
[00:41:11.174 --> 00:41:12.276]  We called it all before it happened.
[00:41:12.637 --> 00:41:14.140]  And then go to infowarestore.com.
[00:41:15.345 --> 00:41:33.842]  As the 2020 Election Super Sale prepares to end, DNA Force Plus with the PQQ and the CoQ10 for your telomeres and your immune system, and the Vitamin Mineral Fusion for adults and children with all the vitamins, all the essential minerals, all the essential amino acids for you, so good for your body, it's there discounted.

[00:41:43.746 --> 00:41:46.828]  This is an extract to concentrate.

[00:41:52.933 --> 00:41:54.674]  But we need money to fund ourselves.
[00:41:54.774 --> 00:41:56.155]  I'm running out of our resources.
[00:41:56.656 --> 00:41:57.016]  I'm on.
[00:41:57.476 --> 00:41:57.737]  I'm on.
[00:41:58.357 --> 00:42:04.543]  Less than a quarter tank and I've got my foot down on that accelerator ramming speed like a game of chicken up against the enemy.
[00:42:04.823 --> 00:42:09.828]  And I just want to keep the gas in so I'm going 200 miles an hour when I go head into those sons of bitches.
[00:42:10.469 --> 00:42:10.989]  We've proven it.
[00:42:11.029 --> 00:42:11.690]  We're the real deal.
[00:42:12.190 --> 00:42:12.811]  I need money.
[00:42:12.831 --> 00:42:13.451]  This is a war.
[00:42:13.812 --> 00:42:14.632]  You need these products.
[00:42:14.693 --> 00:42:15.894]  Get in there and buy them right now.
[00:42:23.413 --> 00:42:26.955]  The foreign-owned globalist media tells us there's no evidence of fraud.
[00:42:28.035 --> 00:42:35.798]  But John Bowne's filed a 15-minute report that's at band.video that lays it all out.
[00:42:36.479 --> 00:42:40.981]  We're gonna air like four minutes of it right now and come back and lay out the latest news on the other side of that.
[00:42:41.001 --> 00:42:46.443]  But the evidence of fraud ignored, here it is from John Bowne, and we'll be right back.
[00:42:47.011 --> 00:42:48.472]  Well, it's official, America.
[00:42:48.592 --> 00:42:54.356]  Joe Biden has just been declared the first blatantly fraudulent President-elect of America.
[00:42:54.716 --> 00:43:01.601]  Joe Biden is now President-elect Joe Biden, and Senator Kamala Harris is now Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.
[00:43:01.621 --> 00:43:04.463]  It's probably a good time for Republicans to learn how to pronounce her name.
[00:43:04.643 --> 00:43:06.084]  This process has been tainted.
[00:43:07.465 --> 00:43:10.227]  And if you taint it for one party, you taint it for the other party.
[00:43:10.807 --> 00:43:14.410]  If you taint it for one American, then you taint it for all Americans.
[00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:16.051]  And we're not going to stand for this.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:25.186]  What damage do you think that Trump will do between losing the election and the swearing, the inauguration of Joe Biden?
[00:43:26.847 --> 00:43:29.649]  Maybe you didn't phrase it quite that way, but that's how I heard it.
[00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:33.392]  And we knew that he would be up to mischief.
[00:43:34.713 --> 00:43:47.858]  Separate and apart from trying to destroy the credibility of our elections, which we criticize other nations for doing, and now with all enemies, foreign and domestic, making assault on our elections.
[00:43:47.978 --> 00:43:49.158]  Well, we have one domestic.
[00:43:49.599 --> 00:43:50.499]  But apart from that,
[00:43:50.859 --> 00:44:01.528]  The word transparency gets kicked around a lot, but there is nothing transparent about the disgraceful 2020 election process that blatantly crushed the will of the American people.
[00:44:01.788 --> 00:44:04.850]  As expected, those votes did indeed close the gap for Joe Biden.
[00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:09.154]  Also, the numbers coming out of Green Bay, Wisconsin, went in favor of Joe Biden.
[00:44:09.234 --> 00:44:12.036]  They are still not in compliance!
[00:44:13.618 --> 00:44:14.959]  Our votes are being suppressed.
[00:44:14.999 --> 00:44:17.501]  We cannot count the votes properly.
[00:44:17.901 --> 00:44:30.589]  What's happening is they have moved the barrier up to six feet, but they took away the ballot machines that were in the front row and moved them to the back of the building.
[00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:32.511]  The court order is in effect.
[00:44:33.091 --> 00:44:38.855]  They will not give us access and the sheriff has decided not to come down here to enforce that court order.
[00:44:39.335 --> 00:44:42.757]  We're there, supposedly observing, but we can't see.
[00:44:43.497 --> 00:44:45.979]  We're further away than I am from you all here.
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:52.202]  At least 100 feet away from open ballots that go back out of our sight.
[00:44:52.282 --> 00:44:53.042]  We can't see them.
[00:44:53.363 --> 00:44:54.583]  We don't know what's happening to them.
[00:44:55.764 --> 00:45:00.626]  It's just, there's no way for us to meaningfully observe the process from where they have us.
[00:45:01.127 --> 00:45:06.770]  Tell us how many ballots approximately went through that process that you had no chance to observe?
[00:45:07.973 --> 00:45:12.316]  Based on the counts that we've heard, it's about 125,000, maybe more.
[00:45:12.556 --> 00:45:23.603]  The mummy Biden rose from his slumber to remind the American public of his insolence, fumbling giant words on the teleprompter in front of a crowd of corporacratic ghost jeeps.
[00:45:24.203 --> 00:45:26.505]  I know watching these vote tallies on TV,
[00:45:27.245 --> 00:45:46.452]  Moves very slow and it's... Speaking of ghosts, of the many things Biden didn't mention was the overwhelming evidence of a ghost in the machine as Dominion Software, the second largest seller of voting machines, flooded our national election with glitches favoring Joe Biden.
[00:45:46.772 --> 00:45:56.596]  In Antrim County, ballots were counted for Democrats that were meant for Republicans, causing a 6,000 vote swing against our candidates.
[00:45:57.731 --> 00:46:04.755]  The county clerk came forward and said tabulating software glitched and caused a miscalculation of the votes.
[00:46:05.355 --> 00:46:13.340]  Since then, we have now discovered that 47 counties use this same software in the same capacity.
[00:46:14.560 --> 00:46:16.501]  And there is also Benford's Law.
[00:46:16.741 --> 00:46:22.724]  It has been used in criminal cases regarding election fraud in the United States at the federal, state, and local levels.
[00:46:22.944 --> 00:46:27.206]  The law detected ballot stuffing in the 2009 Iranian elections.
[00:46:27.346 --> 00:46:36.591]  And the Washington Post reported on the instance of the 2016 Russian election conforming purposefully to Benford's Law in order to hide vote rigging.
[00:46:37.291 --> 00:46:39.192]  I've been active in this since 1958.
[00:46:39.232 --> 00:46:39.633]  That's 62 years.
[00:46:43.075 --> 00:46:47.919]  I am the angriest I have been in that entire six decades.
[00:46:48.840 --> 00:47:03.972]  You have a group of corrupt people who have absolute contempt for the American people, who believe that we are so spineless, so cowardly, so unwilling to stand up for ourselves, that they can steal the presidency.
[00:47:04.813 --> 00:47:09.117]  And we'll wring our hands, bring in a few lawyers, and do nothing.
[00:47:10.234 --> 00:47:12.817]  You know what, this is important.
[00:47:12.978 --> 00:47:15.761]  I'm going to come back and finish this report on the other side.
[00:47:16.161 --> 00:47:19.105]  We've got two big remorts about the report.
[00:47:19.125 --> 00:47:27.695]  Alright, I'm going to issue an emergency message to President Trump coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:47:29.059 --> 00:47:31.181]  And then I have a report that I'm going to issue.
[00:47:31.201 --> 00:47:34.124]  I've done a lot of research for it right before we went live today.
[00:47:34.144 --> 00:47:38.468]  Dealing with the ongoing COVID-19 lockdown and what it's going to mean for you and your family.
[00:47:39.088 --> 00:47:41.090]  I'm your host Alex Jones, but I want to explain something.
[00:47:42.412 --> 00:47:49.438]  They already had this COVID-19 lockdown cooked up with the Chinese to lock down the world and then to reopen China and have China bankrupt the planet.
[00:47:49.939 --> 00:47:52.041]  That was going to be done under Hillary even if Trump lost.
[00:47:54.226 --> 00:47:55.627]  But now they're going ahead with it.
[00:47:55.667 --> 00:47:56.887]  It's not based on reality.
[00:47:56.947 --> 00:47:57.788]  It's so dangerous.
[00:47:58.268 --> 00:48:00.129]  We, the people, must reject it.
[00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:06.672]  Let me just show you some of the headlines right now on what's happened with COVID-19.
[00:48:07.232 --> 00:48:08.893]  Joe Biden's pandemic plan.
[00:48:08.973 --> 00:48:10.774]  Mandatory national face mask.
[00:48:11.174 --> 00:48:12.515]  Quote, paid sick leave.
[00:48:14.164 --> 00:48:18.846]  So that anybody that tests positive goes home, even if you're not sick, to again have the economy shut down.
[00:48:19.286 --> 00:48:24.367]  Restoring Obamacare and free COVID tests to again cause the shutdown.
[00:48:27.768 --> 00:48:31.209]  There's a real risk of third world war being unleashed.
[00:48:32.570 --> 00:48:36.151]  The head of the UK military topped general warrants.
[00:48:38.452 --> 00:48:40.232]  Interview with Sky TV.
[00:48:40.252 --> 00:48:41.653]  In fact, let's grab that interview, guys.
[00:48:42.927 --> 00:48:55.109]  The UK's Chief of Defence Staff, General Sir Rick Carter, has warned that the global economic meltdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to new security threats, which in turn spark a new world war.
[00:48:56.049 --> 00:49:02.611]  And he points out that the third world's already collapsing from starvation from the COVID-19 lockdown, not from COVID-19.
[00:49:02.931 --> 00:49:10.252]  And millions have already died, and hundreds of millions are set to starve to death, and that's going to cause huge resource wars in these countries.
[00:49:12.256 --> 00:49:13.378]  Empty bellies cause wars.
[00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:15.340]  That collapses our borders.
[00:49:15.781 --> 00:49:19.966]  And then Joe Biden's going to sit back during this global crisis and say, give me all the power.
[00:49:20.687 --> 00:49:23.430]  We're going to keep the lockdown in place that causes it.
[00:49:23.550 --> 00:49:30.980]  And the left now loves war, loves torture, loves death, doesn't want to leave the Middle East, wants to stay in charge.
[00:49:35.646 --> 00:49:37.748]  What a twilight zone situation, folks.
[00:49:37.788 --> 00:49:42.853]  They couldn't kick Trump out with all the fake hearings and all the Russiagate, so they stole the election.
[00:49:44.654 --> 00:49:49.899]  And now the head of the UK military comes out and says, Katie, bar the door.
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:53.362]  This is going to cause a global meltdown in martial law.
[00:49:53.703 --> 00:49:59.188]  In fact, since you guys have Biden up there, I've got several of his clips here.
[00:50:00.229 --> 00:50:01.230]  Let's play these frauds.
[00:50:02.691 --> 00:50:03.571]  Let's play clip two.
[00:50:03.692 --> 00:50:07.974]  President-elect Joe Biden vows to usher in a time to heal in America.
[00:50:08.534 --> 00:50:09.375]  Just a few minutes of it.
[00:50:09.835 --> 00:50:12.076]  And then Biden pledges to unify, not divide.
[00:50:12.096 --> 00:50:12.917]  But let's play that first.
[00:50:13.437 --> 00:50:15.518]  Biden pledges to unify, not divide.
[00:50:15.818 --> 00:50:17.519]  Then his surrogates do nothing but divide.
[00:50:17.539 --> 00:50:18.860]  They don't want the country to exist.
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.401]  And then Biden's message to Trump supporters.
[00:50:21.782 --> 00:50:28.205]  Let's play clip three and four before he brought out his CHICOM agent son, Joe Biden.
[00:50:28.685 --> 00:50:30.246]  Talk about American humiliation.
[00:50:30.286 --> 00:50:30.767]  This is it.
[00:50:30.807 --> 00:50:31.167]  Here it is.
[00:50:32.503 --> 00:50:36.665]  And I'm humbled by the trust and confidence you've placed in me.
[00:50:38.426 --> 00:50:43.309]  I pledge to be a president who seeks not to divide, but unify.
[00:50:44.970 --> 00:50:49.672]  Who doesn't see red states and blue states, only sees the United States.
[00:50:50.353 --> 00:50:51.433]  I hate the country's existence.
[00:50:52.754 --> 00:51:00.018]  And work with all my heart, with the confidence of the whole people, to win the confidence of all of you.
[00:51:01.198 --> 00:51:01.759]  And for that,
[00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:05.337]  Is what America, I believe, is about.
[00:51:06.622 --> 00:51:07.465]  It's about people!
[00:51:09.264 --> 00:51:11.806]  And that's what our administration will be all about.
[00:51:12.046 --> 00:51:12.627]  What a monster.
[00:51:13.107 --> 00:51:16.390]  I sought this office to restore the soul of America.
[00:51:17.331 --> 00:51:19.953]  To rebuild the backbone of this nation.
[00:51:20.213 --> 00:51:21.014]  The middle class.
[00:51:21.614 --> 00:51:24.036]  Everything he did was to ship our jobs to China.
[00:51:24.537 --> 00:51:26.038]  Everything he did was to sell us out.
[00:51:26.559 --> 00:51:29.261]  Everything he did was a big joke saying America's never coming back.
[00:51:29.301 --> 00:51:30.682]  And now he's like, don't be afraid.
[00:51:30.702 --> 00:51:32.343]  I'm going to take care of you.
[00:51:32.483 --> 00:51:33.444]  I'm going to fix the country.
[00:51:34.085 --> 00:51:35.106]  What a con man.
[00:51:35.646 --> 00:51:36.367]  What a fraud.
[00:51:36.407 --> 00:51:41.770]  While his surrogates just attack the very existence of the country and just try to make you slaves.
[00:51:41.810 --> 00:51:42.370]  Let's continue.
[00:51:42.991 --> 00:51:45.512]  Make America respected around the world again.
[00:51:45.532 --> 00:51:48.174]  Good, pause again.
[00:51:48.814 --> 00:51:50.395]  Sold out to the entire world.
[00:51:51.235 --> 00:51:55.078]  But he's going to make America respected when he doesn't even believe America should exist.
[00:51:55.118 --> 00:51:55.518]  Continue.
[00:51:56.619 --> 00:51:58.200]  And to unite us here at home.
[00:52:00.001 --> 00:52:05.044]  It's the honor of my lifetime that so many millions of Americans have voted for that vision.
[00:52:06.033 --> 00:52:09.235]  And now, the work of making that vision is real.
[00:52:10.135 --> 00:52:11.456]  Who voted for President Trump?
[00:52:12.137 --> 00:52:13.818]  I understand the disappointment tonight.
[00:52:14.618 --> 00:52:16.319]  I've lost a couple times myself.
[00:52:16.839 --> 00:52:19.901]  But now, let's give each other a chance.
[00:52:19.921 --> 00:52:22.302]  Yeah, lower your guard so I can stab you hard.
[00:52:24.664 --> 00:52:25.144]  Believe this liar.
[00:52:25.164 --> 00:52:27.045]  It's time to put away the harsh rhetoric.
[00:52:27.065 --> 00:52:27.886]  Doesn't want your guns.
[00:52:28.026 --> 00:52:29.126]  Lower the temperature.
[00:52:29.587 --> 00:52:30.027]  Watch your kids.
[00:52:30.047 --> 00:52:30.967]  See each other again.
[00:52:30.987 --> 00:52:31.408]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:31.428 --> 00:52:32.688]  Listen to each other again.
[00:52:32.708 --> 00:52:33.389]  Yeah, lay down.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:35.540]  Well, I take over.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:38.322]  They can stop treating our opponents as our enemies.
[00:52:38.662 --> 00:52:39.023]  Oh yeah, Nazis?
[00:52:39.083 --> 00:52:41.484]  They are not our enemies, they are Americans.
[00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:43.265]  They're Americans.
[00:52:46.167 --> 00:52:47.488]  Hear the patrons outside honking?
[00:52:47.508 --> 00:52:56.393]  The Bible tells us, to everything there is a season, a time to build, a time to reap, and a time to sow, and a time to heal.
[00:52:56.413 --> 00:52:59.015]  This is the time to heal in America.
[00:53:02.253 --> 00:53:04.394]  This deceiver wants you to lower your defenses.
[00:53:04.434 --> 00:53:07.196]  I can say it in private, Ryan, when the Nazis about to stab the guy to death.
[00:53:07.496 --> 00:53:08.216]  He's about to win.
[00:53:08.236 --> 00:53:09.417]  He goes, oh no, I'm your friend.
[00:53:09.697 --> 00:53:11.719]  The guy goes, oh, you're my friend.
[00:53:11.739 --> 00:53:12.579]  The Nazi stabs him.
[00:53:13.239 --> 00:53:13.880]  That's all this is.
[00:53:15.541 --> 00:53:16.221]  That's all this is.
[00:53:16.241 --> 00:53:18.242]  You don't have to believe me.
[00:53:18.723 --> 00:53:20.684]  What I've told you has been almost completely true.
[00:53:20.744 --> 00:53:21.424]  I've made mistakes.
[00:53:21.884 --> 00:53:22.465]  I've admitted to it.
[00:53:22.485 --> 00:53:23.645]  I've been attacked when I've admitted to it.
[00:53:23.665 --> 00:53:25.026]  But I want to just be so honest, I tell you.
[00:53:25.887 --> 00:53:27.948]  Cops pull me over, they go, you've been drinking, you had a bad bottle of wine.
[00:53:28.008 --> 00:53:28.708]  Boom, you're arrested.
[00:53:29.069 --> 00:53:30.930]  Because I'm like neurotic about the truth, folks.
[00:53:31.874 --> 00:53:35.357]  That guy, because I literally cannot, I'm like George Washington.
[00:53:35.457 --> 00:53:38.619]  I wasn't earlier in my life, I didn't tell a lot of lies, but I'd lie about stuff.
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:40.421]  Like a girlfriend, like, are you cheating on me?
[00:53:40.621 --> 00:53:41.241]  No, honey.
[00:53:41.261 --> 00:53:46.205]  You know, my mom, like, did you steal 50 bucks out of my purse?
[00:53:46.265 --> 00:53:48.247]  No, mommy, when I was 12 years old.
[00:53:48.707 --> 00:53:51.529]  But I haven't told a lie consciously in many years now.
[00:53:52.890 --> 00:54:00.076]  That guy spends his whole life lying and lying and lying, and everything he tells you is a lie.
[00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:12.638]  And now he wants to sit there and get you to believe him so you'll jump up to the table and say, God, it's scary he won, but under Stockholm Syndrome, he wants you to Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:54:13.118 --> 00:54:15.000]  Oh, he's gonna be nice to me now.
[00:54:19.363 --> 00:54:21.044]  He said that laptop wasn't real.
[00:54:21.425 --> 00:54:22.445]  Later he said it didn't matter.
[00:54:22.786 --> 00:54:25.268]  He said he didn't want to ban fracking or any oil stuff.
[00:54:25.288 --> 00:54:26.248]  He said he wants to ban it all.
[00:54:26.729 --> 00:54:27.850]  He said he didn't want your guns.
[00:54:27.910 --> 00:54:28.810]  He says ban them all.
[00:54:29.191 --> 00:54:30.852]  You know he's a liar.
[00:54:33.476 --> 00:54:40.259]  He's an empty, disgusting puss bucket that they're preparing to remove, and then Kamala Harris will probably bring Hillary Clinton in.
[00:54:41.700 --> 00:54:42.800]  What a time to be alive.
[00:54:43.260 --> 00:54:44.201]  What a time to be alive.
[00:54:44.221 --> 00:54:45.021]  I just know this.
[00:54:45.281 --> 00:54:47.102]  Thank God for you, the viewers and listeners.
[00:54:47.162 --> 00:54:47.762]  And I mean that.
[00:54:48.082 --> 00:54:49.343]  That's not me patting you on the head.
[00:54:51.564 --> 00:54:56.506]  You knew it was going down, and you supported us through thick and thin, and now everybody else is shut down and we're not.
[00:54:57.366 --> 00:55:00.948]  And now tonight, we have millions and millions of new listeners.
[00:55:02.130 --> 00:55:03.291]  Tuned in to hear the truth.
[00:55:03.992 --> 00:55:05.133]  Tuned in to get the truth out.
[00:55:05.693 --> 00:55:06.714]  Everybody else fell.
[00:55:07.054 --> 00:55:08.115]  Everybody else sold out.
[00:55:08.475 --> 00:55:09.596]  Everybody else didn't get it.
[00:55:09.997 --> 00:55:12.439]  Everybody else didn't make provisions, but we built the arc.
[00:55:13.079 --> 00:55:13.920]  You built the arc.
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:15.381]  We built this system.
[00:55:15.401 --> 00:55:18.083]  This crew built the system, and I salute the crew.
[00:55:18.644 --> 00:55:26.671]  I support our radio affiliates, our TV affiliates, our few sponsors, and our supporters that buy the products, because you changed the world forever.
[00:55:28.413 --> 00:55:43.040]  And whether we're supposed to be like the Alamo and go forward and be destroyed in this fight, or whether we are victorious, it doesn't matter because it's all before God and God's looking down to see what decisions we make right now.
[00:55:45.061 --> 00:55:47.763]  Of course, Biden is the king of Pinocchio.
[00:55:49.414 --> 00:55:52.315]  He is the king, Long Nose Pinocchio, but that's okay.
[00:55:53.135 --> 00:55:54.115]  He's a slave of evil.
[00:55:54.896 --> 00:55:55.456]  He's a joke.
[00:55:55.496 --> 00:55:56.536]  His whole family's a joke.
[00:55:56.996 --> 00:55:58.477]  Thank God every day you're not Hunter Biden.
[00:55:58.577 --> 00:55:59.257]  Thank God.
[00:55:59.737 --> 00:56:05.158]  He'd be a lone truck driver, barely paying his bills, or a school teacher, or a doctor, or a farmer.
[00:56:05.498 --> 00:56:11.740]  As long as you got a connection to God, you got all the wealth in the universe compared to these people, and I want to thank you, and I appreciate you.
[00:56:12.740 --> 00:56:14.801]  We're gonna come back, and I'm gonna hit some other big news.
[00:56:15.621 --> 00:56:17.942]  I was coming on with the COVID lockdown, part two.
[00:56:20.424 --> 00:56:22.565]  And then I've got my emergency message to the President.
[00:56:23.345 --> 00:56:26.047]  I've got my emergency breakdown of the COVID-19 lockdown.
[00:56:27.167 --> 00:56:29.488]  And then Owen Schroer is coming in here live.
[00:56:29.929 --> 00:56:32.230]  He's live and he's strong.
[00:56:33.459 --> 00:56:37.600]  And he's preparing to deploy on a four-day trip to D.C.
[00:56:37.660 --> 00:56:40.821]  and lead a massive caravan where you can join it.
[00:56:41.281 --> 00:56:45.722]  And if you decide to join it, it will send a message to the globalists that they are in deep trouble.
[00:56:46.603 --> 00:56:48.343]  Everybody always wanted a march on D.C.
[00:56:49.103 --> 00:56:49.563]  It's here.
[00:56:50.304 --> 00:56:51.264]  When the chips are down.
[00:56:52.124 --> 00:56:53.024]  What are you gonna do now?
[00:56:53.124 --> 00:56:53.605]  Stay with us.
[00:56:57.306 --> 00:56:59.866]  I'm sorry the universe works this way, but it does.
[00:57:00.006 --> 00:57:00.567]  You see,
[00:57:04.019 --> 00:57:05.239]  There's always predators.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:08.540]  There's always people that seek to take advantage of you.
[00:57:09.961 --> 00:57:17.983]  And most human civilizations get taken over by them, and they never get off the ground because the thugs destroy them.
[00:57:19.644 --> 00:57:26.046]  But other systems get set up, and Western civilization is a great example of that.
[00:57:27.276 --> 00:57:41.674]  And over time, though, people begin to resent the guardians of their freedom, and they begin to resent the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the systems that protect them, and they begin to hate those and call for an end to them.
[00:57:42.841 --> 00:57:44.802]  They don't care they've ever been to Communist China.
[00:57:45.182 --> 00:57:46.783]  They don't care they've ever been to North Korea.
[00:57:47.143 --> 00:57:50.204]  They don't care they've never been inside the EU bureaucracy.
[00:57:50.665 --> 00:57:59.709]  They want America gone because their professor taught them that they got an A+, because they said America shouldn't exist and capitalism was bad.
[00:58:01.701 --> 00:58:13.446]  They didn't care that all the big billionaires other than Trump, literally, are tax-exempt offshore and aren't service-based and make money off interest and want you enslaved.
[00:58:13.686 --> 00:58:20.009]  They don't care that Bill Joy writes articles about it and Bill Gates writes articles about it.
[00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:22.650]  They don't care about opposition research.
[00:58:22.670 --> 00:58:23.910]  They don't care about white papers.
[00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:25.371]  They don't care about facts.
[00:58:28.522 --> 00:58:37.028]  They just believe because the media told them, you're going to rule and you're going to get some free stuff because you take over society and you take over the culture.
[00:58:37.609 --> 00:58:39.430]  And then they sit back, they go, I'm going to be in charge?
[00:58:39.991 --> 00:58:40.891]  Oh, yes!
[00:58:41.832 --> 00:58:44.214]  You want to bring in unlimited third world populations?
[00:58:44.294 --> 00:58:44.934]  You're smart.
[00:58:45.515 --> 00:58:47.756]  Oh, you want to sterilize little boys?
[00:58:47.817 --> 00:58:48.457]  You're good.
[00:58:49.097 --> 00:58:52.040]  Oh, you want to get rid of the churches and Christianity?
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:52.920]  You're a winner.
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:55.162]  And they go, I'm a winner.
[00:58:57.910 --> 00:59:09.473]  You know, people tell me, oh, on the street, yesterday when I was outside for four or five hours, different events, people come up and say, F you, Jones, you're leaders out of office, ha, ha, ha.
[00:59:09.493 --> 00:59:11.813]  And I'd be like, well, that's not really true.
[00:59:12.573 --> 00:59:15.754]  But they think like persecuting me makes me get upset.
[00:59:16.474 --> 00:59:20.335]  Do you know what happened to Infowars after Trump got elected?
[00:59:21.175 --> 00:59:23.376]  Alex Jones basically stopped getting paychecks.
[00:59:24.298 --> 00:59:31.040]  I mean, I got some pretty good paychecks, wasn't the reason I was doing this, but I did like to save some money, take care of all the lawsuits, do everything.
[00:59:31.380 --> 00:59:45.163]  But Trump came along and the days of Alex building this big operation and hiring all this crew and having all this extra money and being able to fund all these other organizations and groups that nobody ever knew about because I didn't want the credit, that all ended.
[00:59:47.224 --> 00:59:51.085]  The day I signed on with Donald John Trump, all I got was pain.
[00:59:53.131 --> 00:59:56.074]  But I knew that was the way to go, the old World War II saying.
[00:59:57.035 --> 00:59:59.137]  Both my grandfathers were in World War II, in Europe.
[01:00:02.019 --> 01:00:06.003]  My dad's dad always said, oh I was an army officer, sure, went to A&M.
[01:00:06.584 --> 01:00:09.206]  But I was just, I managed like food supply and stuff.
[01:00:09.727 --> 01:00:13.991]  He never told us he flew 22 missions over Germany, out of North Africa and Italy.
[01:00:16.109 --> 01:00:20.592]  How he got injured and then the next day his crew went out and they all died, blown up over Germany.
[01:00:20.612 --> 01:00:24.315]  Until he died, we got his letters and his manual and the whole nine yards.
[01:00:25.375 --> 01:00:26.596]  But they had a saying then.
[01:00:27.377 --> 01:00:29.938]  The other one was a fighter pilot crashed, almost died in England.
[01:00:30.699 --> 01:00:31.339]  My mom's dead.
[01:00:34.121 --> 01:00:35.142]  They had a saying though.
[01:00:35.482 --> 01:00:36.683]  They didn't have radar back then.
[01:00:36.903 --> 01:00:38.865]  England had it a little bit limited, but the planes didn't have it.
[01:00:39.285 --> 01:00:40.566]  There wasn't a satellite back then.
[01:00:42.227 --> 01:00:43.648]  They're flying in over Germany.
[01:00:44.855 --> 01:00:45.995]  And you know where they knew how to fly?
[01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:53.157]  The Germans would put up their guns, their flak guns, their shrapnel guns, they'd go up and explode, inhaling metal.
[01:00:54.638 --> 01:00:57.558]  They would encircle the factories and the military bases with guns.
[01:00:58.239 --> 01:01:01.399]  And they'd set off these big tar systems to create black smoke.
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:07.381]  So they flew towards the black smoke and towards the explosions, and they would fly in under orders.
[01:01:07.421 --> 01:01:10.502]  Imagine, you're ordered to fly in to artillery attacking you.
[01:01:11.738 --> 01:01:18.047]  And you fly in and hope you get a shot as best dead reckoning on the map to drop your bombs.
[01:01:19.827 --> 01:01:42.819]  So if my grandfather could get in a B-17 as the captain, and strap himself in an Africa, and launch that thing, and go in with no radar, no nothing, but a compass, and point himself towards the gunfire, I can sure as hell do what I'm doing right now, because I've got all these gears, all these tracking systems, all these gauges, all this intel, and we're doing an amazing job thanks to your support.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:47.101]  And so the enemy's always like, how do you like it getting attacked?
[01:01:47.602 --> 01:01:48.182]  You like that?
[01:01:52.458 --> 01:01:55.461]  I'm like, well I don't like it, but I can feel it.
[01:01:56.261 --> 01:02:02.666]  Because it's right when I'm getting the most attack that I drop the bombs.
[01:02:03.127 --> 01:02:10.713]  And then I can look down and see the explosions below through the black smoke and know I just nailed your dirty ass.
[01:02:12.635 --> 01:02:13.996]  And that's what I want listeners to get.
[01:02:14.296 --> 01:02:16.838]  Nothing is gained without a fight.
[01:02:17.819 --> 01:02:20.061]  Nothing is gained without struggle.
[01:02:21.601 --> 01:02:23.582]  No freedom we have is free.
[01:02:24.443 --> 01:02:24.843]  None of it.
[01:02:25.983 --> 01:02:29.665]  And the minute you start to figure that out, the world gets a lot better from then.
[01:02:30.946 --> 01:02:40.211]  You bow down to Bill Gates, you bow down to Jeff Bezos, you bow down to Tim Cook, you bow down to any of these monsters, and all you gets hell.
[01:02:40.671 --> 01:02:49.936]  Because they've made the selfish, elitist decision that you are scum and you're there to be fed on by them.
[01:02:52.182 --> 01:02:56.824]  I love to be on this live show, and I'm live right now at 526 Central Time.
[01:02:58.105 --> 01:03:14.032]  But right before I went live, before the crew was here, I shot two reports and gave it all I have of the facts on what President Trump needs to do and how he should concede, and how Joe Biden has a martial law planned for you and your family.
[01:03:15.053 --> 01:03:17.674]  First, we're going to air my emergency message to President Trump.
[01:03:18.604 --> 01:03:23.785]  Only way it gets amplified, only way it gets bat-signaled, only way it gets Paul Revered is you.
[01:03:25.065 --> 01:03:25.886]  That's next segment.
[01:03:26.386 --> 01:03:34.148]  And then, I have Joe Biden's announced martial law plan to bring America to its knees.
[01:03:34.268 --> 01:03:35.288]  A foreign army.
[01:03:35.308 --> 01:03:40.069]  If it rolled in with tanks and weapons, we'd all get up and kick their ass.
[01:03:41.155 --> 01:03:49.861]  But if it's done through the UN, the Democratic Party, to permanently lock us down and claim it's all for masks, and it's all for this virus, we would fall.
[01:03:50.561 --> 01:03:51.762]  We must not comply.
[01:03:52.163 --> 01:03:53.263]  It's the final assault.
[01:03:53.784 --> 01:03:55.245]  It's the takeover, and it's here.
[01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:57.686]  And I believe in you.
[01:03:58.307 --> 01:03:59.668]  But put pressure on your governors.
[01:04:00.468 --> 01:04:05.252]  Put pressure on your legislatures before Joe Biden announces this Tuesday or Wednesday.
[01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:08.714]  It's a permanent lockdown, and it's coming.
[01:04:10.908 --> 01:04:12.389]  Small businesses will be shut down.
[01:04:12.449 --> 01:04:14.071]  The big corporations will be kept open.
[01:04:14.891 --> 01:04:20.016]  This is a consolidation of vertical integration and just don't ever spend money with the big banks again.
[01:04:20.036 --> 01:04:29.204]  Don't ever spend money with the big corporations again because they're vertically integrating you and they're attacking you and support those local radio stations and please support InfoWars and please

[01:05:15.731 --> 01:05:18.293]  Coming up, my emergency message to President Trump.
[01:05:18.433 --> 01:05:21.736]  Then, Joe Biden's plan to finally destroy America.
[01:05:22.256 --> 01:05:22.836]  Have you learned?
[01:05:22.916 --> 01:05:23.557]  It's not hype.
[01:05:24.717 --> 01:05:31.241]  Joe Biden is a chi-com globalist agent planning to end the country and bankrupt you and make you a financial slave.
[01:05:31.601 --> 01:05:33.802]  But if you're aware of it, we can stop the operation.
[01:05:34.082 --> 01:05:34.842]  Tell folks to tune in.
[01:05:35.943 --> 01:05:41.806]  Live from the Infowars.com studios in Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:05:41.886 --> 01:05:43.026]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:05:51.644 --> 01:05:53.467]  Okay, the video is at van.video.
[01:05:53.487 --> 01:05:54.829]  It's at infowars.com.
[01:05:55.550 --> 01:05:58.875]  Alex Jones's emergency message to President Trump, do not concede.
[01:05:59.496 --> 01:06:01.920]  There's over a million people conservatively on our streams.
[01:06:02.481 --> 01:06:04.043]  Over a million listening on radio stations.
[01:06:04.063 --> 01:06:04.985]  That's two million people.
[01:06:06.738 --> 01:06:07.339]  Conservative.
[01:06:07.879 --> 01:06:08.320]  I love you.
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:09.461]  I appreciate you're amazing.
[01:06:09.921 --> 01:06:11.162]  I appreciate those that brought you here.
[01:06:11.683 --> 01:06:16.287]  If you decide to spread this video, the president will wake up and say, no, if you don't, we're doomed.
[01:06:16.707 --> 01:06:17.628]  Here is the report.
[01:06:17.969 --> 01:06:22.593]  Next report is on Obama's minion, Joe Biden's plan for martial law.
[01:06:23.394 --> 01:06:28.959]  President Trump, you were about to be approached by Joe Biden and his new COVID-19 commission.
[01:06:29.448 --> 01:06:41.412]  They're going to tell you that, sir, you're going to be blamed for the hundreds of thousands of deaths unless you sign on to a new lockdown, contact tracing, and even people being taken from their homes and forced inoculations.
[01:06:41.952 --> 01:06:51.595]  When you sign on to that, you will be confirming that COVID-19 was your fault and legitimizing the martial law takedown of this country and the complete shutdown of our economy.
[01:06:52.035 --> 01:06:57.437]  This will be the end of the Republic, and you, sir, will be known as Benedict Arnold, who allowed it all to happen.
[01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:06.300]  President Trump, you survived at least four previous illegal coups.
[01:07:07.421 --> 01:07:09.902]  You were illegally spied on during your campaign.
[01:07:10.242 --> 01:07:14.584]  Everyone knows about the illegal fraud of Russiagate, Ukrainegate, the fake impeachment, and more.
[01:07:15.924 --> 01:07:22.127]  And now, the very same corporate media that's so discredited, that's so loathed, that is the enemy of the American people, as you've rightfully said,
[01:07:23.652 --> 01:07:34.600]  Has announced that you're the loser and you have rightfully gone to those states where there is overwhelming clear evidence pouring out that there was organized criminal fraud by big city corrupt machines.
[01:07:35.321 --> 01:07:38.743]  But your own internal advisors and others are telling you stand down.
[01:07:39.303 --> 01:07:44.487]  You're being congratulated by George W. Bush that, oh, you made a good showing, step down.
[01:07:45.348 --> 01:07:50.452]  If you do that, they're going to set you up and destroy your legacy and blame you for COVID-19.
[01:07:51.923 --> 01:07:53.144]  And then destroy this republic.
[01:07:53.925 --> 01:08:00.890]  If you stand up and fight back hard, it is they that will be destroyed, not you and not America.
[01:08:01.210 --> 01:08:07.715]  Bill Gates, the United Nations, the Wuhan lab, Fauci are all on record running that facility.
[01:08:08.136 --> 01:08:14.681]  And as soon as they knew that you were about to beat the fake impeachment, they rolled out the hysteria and the fear that we witnessed.
[01:08:15.802 --> 01:08:20.125]  You took the right action, not knowing how deadly it was, and shut down flights from China.
[01:08:20.558 --> 01:08:23.264]  Because their plan all along was to blame you for it.
[01:08:23.805 --> 01:08:30.640]  Then once it spread in the United States and began killing Americans, they turned around and said that you were to blame.
[01:08:31.533 --> 01:08:51.873]  That's why it's so essential for you now to not concede the election, but to come out with your bully pulpit of the Oval Office and lay out the Newsweek articles and the New Scientist articles and all the documents that Fauci and Gates, under Obama's command, before you ever got into office in 2013, 14 and 15,
[01:08:54.568 --> 01:09:02.078]  We're running the very exact COVID-19 weaponized virus test at Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
[01:09:02.418 --> 01:09:08.947]  And when that was made illegal because of protest by the scientific community, it was moved to Communist China at Wuhan.
[01:09:09.728 --> 01:09:17.952]  I know the viewers of this emergency video and the White House and even the President are asking, Jones, we know about what happened with COVID and the UN Chinese power grab.
[01:09:17.972 --> 01:09:26.496]  Why are you telling us about it instead of getting into the election fraud in Pennsylvania, the election fraud in Georgia, the election fraud in Michigan and Nevada and Arizona?
[01:09:26.897 --> 01:09:28.818]  Why, Jones, are you covering COVID?
[01:09:29.098 --> 01:09:29.538]  Because, sir,
[01:09:30.723 --> 01:09:43.612]  I want you and your advisors to know what they're planning to do to drive you from office before January 20th and how they're planning to then blame you for COVID-19 that's been their plan all along.
[01:09:43.812 --> 01:09:54.860]  If they're able to trick you, then your legacy and all your supporters will be irrevocably connected to the COVID-19 deaths and the American people will be persecuted.
[01:09:55.256 --> 01:10:02.162]  And Americanism itself will be demonized, connected to the Wuhan virus, which is a Chinese communist bioweapon.
[01:10:02.663 --> 01:10:08.387]  Joe Biden, who's already had the entire corporate media blaming you, President Trump, and the American people for COVID-19.
[01:10:09.785 --> 01:10:10.065]  All right.
[01:10:29.617 --> 01:10:40.150]  Undefined lockdown, face masks for at least two more years, and a shutdown of the economy as well as forced inoculations as soon as they're ready.
[01:10:41.286 --> 01:10:47.871]  Then, they will demand that you, who is still President, elected under the Constitution, implement these plans.
[01:10:48.651 --> 01:11:07.864]  If you do not immediately agree, they're going to say that 260 plus thousand, most of them deaths as you know from something else, are on your watch, and are on your head, and that you are guilty of this under the 25th Amendment, and are not fit to be the President of the United States.
[01:11:08.244 --> 01:11:10.146]  They want to further discredit you.
[01:11:11.243 --> 01:11:26.390]  Not just with this fraudulent election, but to certify that fraudulent election by having your own cabinet remove you under the 25th Amendment because you don't follow the recommendations and orders of Joe Biden's new globalist COVID-19 task force.
[01:11:26.711 --> 01:11:27.391]  And here's the problem.
[01:11:28.266 --> 01:11:41.077]  If you follow the lockdown, they will put your name on the coming depression in the United States and blame you for all the previous deaths, saying later you actually admitted that you were the one behind it all.
[01:11:42.178 --> 01:11:51.086]  Again, if you don't sign on to it, you've got to come out and expose Fauci, Bill Gates, Joe Biden, and all of them in Oval Office addresses.
[01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:53.789]  And that is the only path to stop them.
[01:11:54.534 --> 01:11:56.176]  They're going to have Jared Kushner approach you.
[01:11:56.436 --> 01:11:59.720]  They're going to have others come to you and say, listen, we're ready to make a deal, Trump.
[01:12:00.181 --> 01:12:01.422]  We won't destroy your legacy.
[01:12:02.243 --> 01:12:11.114]  We won't blame you for COVID, but you've got to admit you were wrong and you've got to do what Biden says and you've got to let us take control.
[01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:14.416]  President Trump, the mainstream media has choreographed all of this.
[01:12:14.696 --> 01:12:16.657]  They have fraudulently blamed you for COVID-19.
[01:12:16.917 --> 01:12:18.278]  The American people do not believe it.
[01:12:18.298 --> 01:12:18.918]  They know the truth.
[01:12:19.178 --> 01:12:20.299]  They elected you overwhelmingly.
[01:12:20.679 --> 01:12:24.281]  And so this new fifth coup of election fraud is designed to take you out.
[01:12:24.941 --> 01:12:33.845]  If you comply, if you quote, take the olive branch, the neocons and Mitt Romney and George W. Bush and say, okay, I'll follow the recommendations of president-elect
[01:12:34.165 --> 01:12:36.666]  Mr. President, I know you care about America.
[01:12:51.092 --> 01:12:51.332]  I don't know.
[01:13:13.055 --> 01:13:22.818]  We need you to reconfirm in the face of Fox News and the other sellout traders that you are never going to concede to fraud and sell out the election system in this country.
[01:13:23.139 --> 01:13:25.459]  We know you're our champion and we stand behind you.
[01:13:25.679 --> 01:13:29.001]  President Trump, you have rightfully pointed out the statistics from the U.N.
[01:13:29.041 --> 01:13:36.163]  itself that the lockdown was too intense, so strong, and has already caused millions to die and tens of millions are on the verge of starvation.
[01:13:36.763 --> 01:13:41.165]  You have come out and pointed out that you can never defeat a virus by staying locked up in your house.
[01:13:41.545 --> 01:13:41.945]  We're good to go.
[01:14:00.663 --> 01:14:06.825]  Could trigger World War 3, and there's an extreme danger of it, and that another lockdown is not needed.
[01:14:07.445 --> 01:14:16.547]  Mr. President, we need you to point out the millions that are starving to death, the collapse of borders, and what this is doing to good governance around the world.
[01:14:16.927 --> 01:14:21.429]  The big mega banks, the big corporations, want to have a crisis to consolidate control.
[01:14:21.689 --> 01:14:22.989]  They want to destroy middle classes.
[01:14:23.369 --> 01:14:26.390]  You've been a champion of the middle classes, and we need you to come out
[01:14:26.721 --> 01:14:26.821]  Yes.
[01:14:43.857 --> 01:14:45.637]  And to peacefully stand against this tyranny.
[01:14:45.737 --> 01:14:49.178]  Now is the time for all good men and women to come to the aid of their country.
[01:14:49.358 --> 01:15:04.742]  For all of you watching, not just the White House and law enforcement and security agencies around the world, I also want to encourage you to remember, despite the fact that big tech censorship has basically silenced everyone else's voice, we're still on air at Infowars.com forward slash show and band on video.
[01:15:04.822 --> 01:15:09.743]  And we're going to be making major announcements later this evening about massive caravans
[01:15:10.063 --> 01:15:11.544]  I come to you with horrifying and grave news.
[01:15:11.564 --> 01:15:13.685]  I don't come to you with this information to scare you.
[01:15:35.512 --> 01:15:40.233]  I respect you and I believe that you deserve to know the truth of what we're facing.
[01:15:41.373 --> 01:15:59.197]  President-elect Joe Biden, who has been announced by the corporate media and all the big banks and the chi-coms to be our new president despite all the fraud, is openly preparing a task force in his own press releases that is calling for an endless, permanent lockdown
[01:16:00.370 --> 01:16:05.952]  Endless face masks, COVID-19 tracking and tracing, and forced inoculations.
[01:16:05.972 --> 01:16:10.833]  I'm about to lay out this information for you and your family.
[01:16:11.093 --> 01:16:19.156]  When Joe Biden says he wants love and reconciliation, remember that everything he's told you previously is a giant bald-faced lie.
[01:16:19.856 --> 01:16:29.299]  And remember, the establishment, the most corrupt corporations in the world, are steamrolling him to install him as the first dictator of the United States.
[01:16:31.437 --> 01:16:54.661]  The UK's Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir Nick Carter, has warned that the global economic meltdown caused by the COVID-19 lockdown pandemic may lead to new security threats, which in turn may spark a new world war.
[01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:57.722]  First off on this emergency Sunday night transmission,
[01:16:58.510 --> 01:17:03.935]  Let me show you an article posted on Infowars.com with direct links to the Ministry of Defense in the UK.
[01:17:15.802 --> 01:17:28.065]  It's already starved millions to death, and it's already triggering giant wars in the third and first world that could escalate very easily in a domino effect into World War III.
[01:17:28.765 --> 01:17:45.189]  Well, it just so turns out the Communist Chinese and others are on record with Bill Gates admitting that they're trying to lower the world's carbon footprint and destroy everybody else's industries who lock down because they're good guys and want to defeat the virus, and then only Communist China and the globalist holdings are left operating.
[01:17:46.072 --> 01:17:53.856]  The problem is that the population is growing the fastest where people are less able to deal with it.
[01:17:54.076 --> 01:17:56.617]  So it's in the very poorest places.
[01:17:57.218 --> 01:18:03.961]  The individuals that Joe Biden is nominating for his COVID-19 task force are on record working for Bill Gates in the UN.
[01:18:04.341 --> 01:18:13.246]  And they openly admit they want forced inoculations, contact tracers, and individuals that come to your home and even break up your family and take you away to COVID centers.
[01:18:14.209 --> 01:18:16.711]  This isn't some nightmare science fiction movie.
[01:18:17.111 --> 01:18:18.632]  This is the reality of what's happening.
[01:18:18.992 --> 01:18:25.177]  And Bill Gates is on record just a few weeks ago saying the lockdown's gonna last 10 years until you go back to normal.
[01:18:25.797 --> 01:18:27.218]  Remember it was gonna be 15 days?
[01:18:27.238 --> 01:18:29.200]  Because the hospitals were full but they weren't?
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:35.224]  Then it'd be two months, then it'd be six months, then it'd be two years, then it'd be five years, and now they're telling you it's forever.
[01:18:35.904 --> 01:18:39.367]  The only way we'll get completely back to normal
[01:18:40.115 --> 01:18:55.983]  Is by having not maybe not the first generation vaccines, but eventually a vaccine that is super effective and that a lot of the people take and that we get the disease eliminated on a global basis.
[01:18:57.144 --> 01:19:06.729]  That is where we can finally start taking all the problems that have been created in education, mental health and start to build back.
[01:19:07.406 --> 01:19:08.267]  In a positive way.
[01:19:35.089 --> 01:19:38.050]  Infection increases while the rate of death stays very, very small.
[01:19:38.670 --> 01:19:40.731]  They told us 5% of the population will be dead.
[01:19:40.951 --> 01:19:43.992]  They told us 2.5 million, then 2.3 million Americans will be dead.
[01:19:44.212 --> 01:19:45.553]  They told us a half million Brits will be dead.
[01:19:46.073 --> 01:19:47.213]  None of it was true.
[01:19:47.874 --> 01:19:57.177]  It was part of putting us under a martial law system ahead of taking out nation states run by populists and nationalists like Donald Trump, Bolsonaro, and others.
[01:19:57.757 --> 01:20:06.308]  So let that sink in that the head of the UK military is coming out and admitting that the COVID-19 lockdown is bringing our world towards total destruction.
[01:20:06.869 --> 01:20:15.560]  How worried are you that the global economic crisis brought on by coronavirus could lead to new security threats, potentially even war?
[01:20:16.431 --> 01:20:22.313]  Yes, I mean I think we're living at a moment in time where the world is a very uncertain and anxious place.
[01:20:23.033 --> 01:20:28.095]  And of course the dynamic of global competition is a feature of our lives as well.
[01:20:28.615 --> 01:20:36.057]  And I think the real risk we have with quite a lot of the regional conflicts that are going on at the moment is you could see escalation lead to miscalculation.
[01:20:36.497 --> 01:20:41.519]  So what that means is that the protagonists, either because they don't realise the implications of their actions,
[01:20:42.199 --> 01:20:43.360]  Now here's where President Trump comes in.
[01:21:07.535 --> 01:21:12.018]  Joe Biden is forming his new commission made up of a bunch of Bill Gates and U.N.
[01:21:12.058 --> 01:21:16.501]  alumni that are going to blame President Trump for what happened with COVID-19.
[01:21:16.862 --> 01:21:17.962]  Despite the fact that U.N.
[01:21:18.003 --> 01:21:24.147]  admits they helped cover up the fact that China is where COVID-19 came from, and that's where the initial spread took place.
[01:21:24.707 --> 01:21:32.093]  Joe Biden's transition team today released a nightmare list of information to MarketWatch about what they're planning to do.
[01:21:32.878 --> 01:21:32.998]  Yeah.
[01:22:03.302 --> 01:22:05.163]  We're going to act to get COVID under control.
[01:22:05.183 --> 01:22:12.407]  On day one of my presidency, I'll put in action a plan I've been talking about for months, already laid out.
[01:22:12.868 --> 01:22:24.855]  A national mandate, mask wearing, social distancing, testing, tracing, all things, as President Obama just said, that should have and could have been put in place months and months ago.
[01:22:25.811 --> 01:22:31.093]  They're now coming out and saying President Trump is to blame for COVID-19, hoping he doesn't challenge it.
[01:22:31.473 --> 01:22:40.695]  Saying that if Trump doesn't give control 70 plus days before he leaves office to Joe Biden, he will be blamed for any future COVID deaths.
[01:22:41.296 --> 01:22:45.757]  Even if President Trump does that, they're going to turn around and say, see, he admits he's wrong.
[01:22:46.137 --> 01:22:47.778]  His previous response was bad.
[01:22:48.258 --> 01:22:48.998]  It's his fault.
[01:22:49.821 --> 01:22:58.449]  If he does turn over the administration, which no president's ever done, months early, it sets an incredibly dangerous precedent as well.
[01:22:58.790 --> 01:23:10.221]  And now Trump will be signing his legacy on to the endless lockdown and the depression and the worldwide collapse that's being engineered by the globalists to consolidate power and control on record.
[01:23:10.701 --> 01:23:14.185]  And then they're still going to blame Trump and say he's the one to blame.
[01:23:14.645 --> 01:23:20.571]  The only path out of this is the hard core steel truth that will smash through their lies.
[01:23:21.312 --> 01:23:23.374]  And that's that Fauci and the U.N.
[01:23:23.394 --> 01:23:34.424]  when Bill Gates cooked this up, they released it, they created the fear, they got in the United States, they hyped it up, they exaggerated it, they created the hysteria, and now they intend to never turn loose.
[01:23:35.345 --> 01:23:42.291]  of the weapon they released and they're going to blame the populist president they launched it on for being the one that allowed it to take place.
[01:23:42.792 --> 01:23:50.479]  That is true destruction and inversion of the truth and it must be rejected because this is a trillion times bigger than President Trump.
[01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:58.005]  This is about all of our lives and our future and stopping this medical big pharma tyranny takeover that's happening now.
[01:23:58.846 --> 01:23:59.606]  Don't believe me?
[01:23:59.706 --> 01:24:06.228]  Go to Infowars.com and read the quotes from Biden's new UN-backed COVID-19 task force.
[01:24:06.708 --> 01:24:09.049]  And above his comments, I have my own comment.
[01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:10.089]  Here's what I had to say.
[01:24:10.830 --> 01:24:18.712]  If you want to have a martial law takeover, you want to use medical systems to do it because those are the most respected, and studies show people will submit to that more.
[01:24:19.512 --> 01:24:24.514]  Then you create a man-made virus that spreads very well, that's not very deadly, but that reinfects.
[01:24:25.691 --> 01:24:30.333]  Then you announce that no one can ever have their freedoms back until it's totally eradicated and that you take the vaccine.
[01:24:30.913 --> 01:24:33.154]  Then they tell you, sorry, the vaccine's never going to work either.
[01:24:34.114 --> 01:24:40.537]  So you just got to have restrictions of where you go and what you do forever with these apps that control and track your whole life with a social credit score.
[01:24:41.277 --> 01:24:42.097]  And that's the takeover.
[01:24:42.718 --> 01:24:50.981]  Then they start announcing, but we are going to send contact tracers to your house and take you away if you don't submit to the medical protocols we're going to carry out that don't even protect
[01:24:57.188 --> 01:25:02.730]  Infowars has the biggest audiences right now we've ever had, despite the censorship.
[01:25:02.830 --> 01:25:03.811]  And I'm not happy about that.
[01:25:04.771 --> 01:25:08.472]  People are tuned in because we predicted they'd steal the election from Trump.
[01:25:08.813 --> 01:25:10.433]  We predicted forced inoculation.
[01:25:10.733 --> 01:25:17.256]  We predicted contact tracers in films I made 13 years ago because we're going off the globalist's own plans.
[01:25:18.226 --> 01:25:22.008]  So President Trump, you must address from the Oval Office this fraud.
[01:25:22.408 --> 01:25:23.749]  You must take on Fauci.
[01:25:24.029 --> 01:25:25.210]  You must take on Gates.
[01:25:25.810 --> 01:25:28.432]  I know they're coming to you and saying, we won't blame you for the deaths.
[01:25:28.912 --> 01:25:32.134]  We'll protect your entire legacy if you roll over to us.
[01:25:32.214 --> 01:25:37.237]  But they want to destroy the American people's legacy, and they're going to betray you.
[01:25:37.717 --> 01:25:39.738]  You know they've been lying about you for five years.
[01:25:40.118 --> 01:25:47.139]  You know they're frauds and the only way out of this is for you to not concede and to expose these criminals now more than you've ever done.
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:50.640]  Only you can cut through the censorship and propaganda.
[01:25:51.201 --> 01:26:00.623]  Only you can awaken the sleeping giant and now is the time because they are again in all these news articles announcing permanent lockdowns, forced inoculations, masks for
[01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:06.554]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when it comes to the show?
[01:26:06.734 --> 01:26:23.767]  And it's the fact that Infowars, more than 25 years ago, doing basic research with what the Club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying, developed the hypothesis that communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[01:26:24.327 --> 01:26:25.568]  Well, now China owns the debt.
[01:26:25.588 --> 01:26:28.351]  Now China owns Hollywood, all the one-sided trading deals.
[01:26:29.071 --> 01:26:33.234]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on, but again, it wasn't that hard.
[01:26:33.735 --> 01:26:39.299]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't want to focus on that issue.
[01:26:39.359 --> 01:26:43.382]  We did, and you focused on it by supporting us and InfoWars.
[01:26:43.863 --> 01:26:54.591]  So when you go to InfoWarsStore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts, films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world what's really happening.
[01:26:54.931 --> 01:26:56.453]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[01:26:56.473 --> 01:26:57.754]  I want to thank you for your support.
[01:27:00.967 --> 01:27:07.533]  We're only here on air facing the globalist onslaught, the DNC-funded lawsuits, and everything that's happening because of you.
[01:27:07.553 --> 01:27:14.979]  We built the only truly multimedia, independent radio, TV, print, film organization in the world that promotes the truth against the globalists.
[01:27:14.999 --> 01:27:16.240]  We've had a devastating effect.
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:17.501]  We're a national treasure.
[01:27:17.521 --> 01:27:19.563]  You're a national treasure for supporting us.
[01:27:19.803 --> 01:27:21.064]  And so, go get a t-shirt.
[01:27:21.144 --> 01:27:22.505]  Go get a historic t-shirt.
[01:27:23.266 --> 01:27:26.088]  We've got a funny one that's the Biden groping a woman.
[01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:27.349]  It's a woman's design shirt.
[01:27:27.509 --> 01:27:28.449]  My wife really likes it.
[01:27:28.469 --> 01:27:29.270]  She sent me this gift.
[01:27:29.390 --> 01:27:30.030]  It's pretty cute.
[01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.410]  Here it is.
[01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:32.251]  And it just, you know, it's a little historic thing.
[01:27:32.292 --> 01:27:33.572]  I think Trump's gonna win.
[01:27:33.632 --> 01:27:36.434]  But if Biden's able to steal it, we'll be probably shut down pretty quick.
[01:27:36.474 --> 01:27:38.015]  So it'll be a historic thing to have.
[01:27:38.095 --> 01:27:52.724]  You'll only be able to fight them in the third dimension on the street with graffiti, with handbills you hand out, and with noncompliance, not paying taxes, and pulling your kids out of the schools, and just making it a full-time job to expose and fight and obstruct the criminal foreign takeover of America.
[01:27:52.984 --> 01:27:54.024]  We've gotten to that point.
[01:27:54.184 --> 01:27:55.205]  Biden for nursing home.
[01:27:55.285 --> 01:27:57.446]  I hope to retire Biden and that'd be a collector's item.
[01:27:57.526 --> 01:27:58.506]  Get it while you still can.
[01:27:58.526 --> 01:27:59.306]  We're not ordering more.
[01:27:59.446 --> 01:28:00.547]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:28:01.067 --> 01:28:08.409]  Infowars has been reporting on the dark, unpleasant truths of big government corruption for over two decades.
[01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:10.170]  It is why they attack us.
[01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:15.092]  And it is why we are now the most banned broadcast in the world.
[01:28:16.331 --> 01:28:20.253]  The Hunter Biden hard drive scandal is merely the tip of the iceberg.
[01:28:21.094 --> 01:28:23.375]  Evil has infested governments everywhere.
[01:28:23.675 --> 01:28:28.618]  But the evil establishment is censoring content across all media platforms.
[01:28:29.158 --> 01:28:32.780]  They blocked you from sharing banned.video on social media.
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:39.123]  So go to electionnight.news and share it like your lives depended on it.
[01:28:40.714 --> 01:28:48.622]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID, vaccines, Bill Gates and Big Pharma.
[01:28:48.982 --> 01:28:55.889]  Go to electionnight.news to find all the information the crooked establishment is most afraid of.
[01:28:56.430 --> 01:29:00.133]  Go to electionnight.news and share now.
[01:29:01.337 --> 01:29:05.261]  Two Info Wars best-selling products are now back in stocks for being sold out for months.

[01:29:19.375 --> 01:29:19.955]  We're good to go.

[01:29:46.208 --> 01:29:46.909]  It's amazing.

[01:29:53.116 --> 01:29:54.758]  This sale will not last long.
