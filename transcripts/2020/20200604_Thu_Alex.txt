[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:04.550]  If you say there's a system of white supremacy, why would you want to centralize the power?
[00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.710]  That's what socialism and communism would do, would centralize the power and give you no power.
[00:00:09.251 --> 00:00:20.212]  But people don't understand, for example, George Orwell was a former member of the Fabian Society, and the Fabian Society, when you look at their shield, you'll see a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[00:00:20.232 --> 00:00:25.773]  So when you see democratic socialists, socialists, and communists, what you're looking at is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[00:00:26.093 --> 00:00:29.234]  He'll pretend like he's your ally, waiting.
[00:00:30.037 --> 00:00:32.618]  He'll post that black box on his Instagram page.
[00:00:33.398 --> 00:00:39.900]  He may even take a knee, but that's the same exact person that gets close enough to stab you in the back.
[00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.081]  Black people are actually happy that white people are taking this knee.
[00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:50.603]  These are like moral victories, and as Jay-Z would say, moral victories are for minor league coaches.
[00:00:51.943 --> 00:00:56.485]  These little moral victories don't do anything to prop up the black community.
[00:00:57.085 --> 00:00:57.365]  They're
[00:00:58.209 --> 00:01:05.392]  Actually only helping white people who are racist, who are democrat, socialist, racist, hide their racism.
[00:01:05.852 --> 00:01:10.614]  That's all it's doing is allowing them to cloak their racism.
[00:01:11.115 --> 00:01:14.996]  Here we see the National Guard kneeling before people.
[00:01:15.637 --> 00:01:16.237]  That's cute.
[00:01:16.877 --> 00:01:17.457]  That's cute.
[00:01:18.498 --> 00:01:21.159]  Has nothing to do with the military industrial complex.
[00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.753]  That's not going to change how much money goes towards the military budget.
[00:01:25.873 --> 00:01:29.916]  I was about to say an alligator or crocodile will come up kneeling in the mud right before it eats you.
[00:01:30.196 --> 00:01:38.061]  And I'm not saying the military is bad, but I'm saying the thing behind it is like a crocodile and it'll get up on its back, it'll come up, it'll bow down to you.
[00:01:38.562 --> 00:01:43.686]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:58.207]  An international corporate globalist conspiracy using communism as its operating system is waging war against the nation-state that's based on free market capitalism.
[00:01:59.528 --> 00:02:02.750]  And the shining example of that has been the United States of America.
[00:02:03.351 --> 00:02:06.733]  That's why Antifa, the paramilitary arm of the New World Order, is international.
[00:02:07.253 --> 00:02:12.317]  That's why their slogan is no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[00:02:14.122 --> 00:02:23.310]  And all over the world, United States citizens are being brutally attacked by Muslims, by Africans,
[00:02:40.987 --> 00:02:42.787]  By people from the Middle East, from Asia.
[00:02:43.328 --> 00:02:53.570]  The thing to do is attack white people, because the international Marxist-globalist system, run by the big megabanks and by big tech, is teaching that.
[00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:00.492]  To create the collapse of society and enslave the first world, along with the third world, that they're now exploiting.
[00:03:00.912 --> 00:03:07.233]  You're watching video of Antifab, Moloff Cocktails, burning and attacking the U.S.
[00:03:07.653 --> 00:03:09.914]  Embassy in Athens, Greece.
[00:03:20.026 --> 00:03:22.767]  The megabanks want to consolidate and vertically integrate the economy.
[00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:26.730]  They want to bankrupt the middle class whether you be brown, black or white.
[00:03:27.991 --> 00:03:29.932]  It is their sworn globalist goal.
[00:03:32.394 --> 00:03:35.876]  And the communists are now heavily financed and are attacking the U.S.
[00:03:35.936 --> 00:03:36.276]  Embassy.
[00:03:38.838 --> 00:03:43.181]  That's why Senator Cotton of Arkansas, Army veteran himself, has come out and said
[00:03:45.054 --> 00:03:46.295]  Send in the troops.
[00:03:47.196 --> 00:03:49.919]  And you've got traitors like the Democrat Mattis.
[00:03:51.454 --> 00:03:53.536]  Saying that Trump's a danger to the Constitution.
[00:03:54.256 --> 00:04:14.753]  When you have leftist governors pushing insurrection and a breakdown of society after a three-month lockdown to bankrupt the economy, and they're now going from mail-in ballots to email ballots, and they're openly saying the borders shouldn't exist while the lockdown causes a total third world collapse and hundreds of millions coming our way.
[00:04:15.093 --> 00:04:19.677]  And the UN says that's the plan, bringing hundreds of millions that they control politically.
[00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:27.484]  And then because those people aren't white, you divide them into racial groups as their uniform to control them.
[00:04:28.325 --> 00:04:32.208]  This is a classical gang takeover.
[00:04:32.828 --> 00:04:35.610]  Of course, the brown people coming in aren't going to take over anything.
[00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:38.773]  They're just being used as pawns on the chessboard.
[00:04:40.222 --> 00:04:49.147]  It is the 31st anniversary of Tiananmen Square when pro-America, pro-democracy demonstrators said we're sick of the Communist Party being our masters.
[00:04:49.227 --> 00:04:52.488]  Thousands were machine gunned and run over by armored vehicles.
[00:04:53.909 --> 00:05:05.375]  That's a real tyranny when the military comes in to kill peaceful people who are simply peacefully demonstrating for free speech at their university.
[00:05:06.735 --> 00:05:10.356]  They had to send troops from 800 miles away because the local troops wouldn't attack them.
[00:05:11.236 --> 00:05:25.320]  But when the governors and the mayors encourage looting and rioting and attacks on white people, led by white people, that is not just an insurrection, it is a foreign-funded overthrow of the country.
[00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.981]  And that's what the communists in Antifa and all of them say.
[00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:32.262]  And the Justice Department's opened a criminal investigation into Antifa.
[00:05:33.237 --> 00:05:34.557]  They're trying to figure out, quote, who funds it.
[00:05:34.617 --> 00:05:37.938]  Well, Alexander Soros captains the main funding group.
[00:05:38.299 --> 00:05:39.679]  Soros funds it on record.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.840]  Bill Ayers and all of them are involved.
[00:05:45.661 --> 00:05:51.082]  You have the Rise Up different action committees that run full-page ads in the New York Times.
[00:05:51.162 --> 00:05:54.603]  We know who prints the signage, who prints the booklets.
[00:05:54.984 --> 00:05:57.104]  We know the names of all the people.
[00:05:57.124 --> 00:06:02.886]  In fact, when you guys bring in my New York Times full-page ad from two years ago, it tells you who runs Antifa right there at the bottom.
[00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:12.809]  They're the ones buying $100,000 ads in the papers saying, rise up, overthrow the government, meaning the elected government, and bring in a permanent tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:14.750]  I'm Mr. Anti-Police State.
[00:06:15.391 --> 00:06:16.912]  The lockdown's the police state.
[00:06:17.813 --> 00:06:22.617]  The globalists coming to take our guns is the police state, telling us we can't have pro-gun demonstrations.
[00:06:22.957 --> 00:06:23.918]  It's the Democrats.
[00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:25.600]  They're overthrowing the country.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.181]  We have to save the country.
[00:06:27.662 --> 00:06:28.943]  That's what our military does.
[00:06:31.512 --> 00:06:48.608]  151.
[00:06:31.532 --> 00:06:48.608]  151 days to the incredibly important election that the New World Order globalists are throwing everything they can at to either cancel and overthrow Trump via the 25th Amendment, assassinate the president, and or steal the election bigger than Dallas.
[00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:51.510]  Coming to you live from deep in the heart of Texas.
[00:06:51.931 --> 00:06:56.073]  Broadcasting worldwide on this Thursday, June 4th, 2020 transmission.
[00:06:56.534 --> 00:06:57.714]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:06:58.275 --> 00:06:59.716]  Only way we reach new people.
[00:07:00.316 --> 00:07:04.779]  Only way we expose the dire straits the Republic is in and save the country and the world.
[00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:22.044]  is when you get excited and when you spread the live links to newswars.com forward slash show, infowars.com forward slash show, and band.video and telling folks about the local AM and FM stations and TV stations that carry this transmission in your area.
[00:07:22.344 --> 00:07:23.765]  You are Paul Revere.
[00:07:24.746 --> 00:07:27.287]  And as you can see, it's not been rhetoric.
[00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:44.435]  When I've been here on air telling you that get ready for martial law, get ready for civil war, get ready for the Joker movie to lionize and legitimize mass killing of police and white people or anybody that's seen as well to do.
[00:07:45.136 --> 00:07:53.618]  It's a fake class struggle by trillion dollar companies run by billionaires worth hundreds of billions apiece.
[00:07:54.793 --> 00:08:06.520]  Who are openly funding Black Lives Matter and Antifa and the communist movement so that you never actually figure out how they've destroyed the middle class and how they are consolidating power.
[00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:18.027]  They give you the operating system of class struggle and communism through the state-controlled media and state-controlled universities that you go to believing you're fighting the man
[00:08:19.915 --> 00:08:26.139]  But all you're really doing is removing the last vestiges of the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, elected government, U.S.
[00:08:26.179 --> 00:08:30.882]  military, so there can be a full takeover by the globalists.
[00:08:32.022 --> 00:08:32.843]  And that's where we are.
[00:08:33.543 --> 00:08:37.405]  The last vestiges of the old republic being swept away.
[00:08:38.826 --> 00:08:48.092]  And the very IMF World Bank-controlled systems set up by the Rockefeller dynasty that hijacked America and transferred our power to China
[00:08:49.051 --> 00:08:55.436]  Run giant open-air death camps all over China with Christians, Buddhists, and Muslims.
[00:08:56.096 --> 00:08:56.957]  It's an atheist state.
[00:08:58.458 --> 00:09:04.663]  Three million Muslims in death camps and even mainstream news admits Apple has them making slave components.
[00:09:07.708 --> 00:09:24.693]  But Tim Cook goes around waving his arms around like a demonic leprechaun, talking about how he's banning right-wingers, and how he loves Black Lives Matter, and they're having Black Tuesday, hijacking your devices, because he cares so much about one black man that died in Minnesota.
[00:09:26.593 --> 00:09:28.114]  It's a total fraud.
[00:09:28.594 --> 00:09:32.575]  And once they get you virtue signaling, they have the National Guard bowing to the looters,
[00:09:34.753 --> 00:09:43.737]  They have the police bowing to the looters, and I watched the videos from Sweden, from Spain, from the United States.
[00:09:43.937 --> 00:09:54.562]  It is frothing, hateful, really demonic-looking people that are out there attacking.
[00:09:55.362 --> 00:09:56.523]  Very low IQ.
[00:09:57.283 --> 00:09:59.524]  They can be old, they can be young, they can be black, they can be white.
[00:09:59.564 --> 00:10:02.446]  It's just frothing, absolutely,
[00:10:03.689 --> 00:10:14.935]  Hateful people running around throwing Moloff cocktails, attacking the press, and just randomly beating up old white women because they're white, and screaming, you're an effing white male when they're white.
[00:10:16.056 --> 00:10:16.996]  You don't have speech!
[00:10:17.436 --> 00:10:21.559]  You're an effing white male, says AIDS Skrillex.
[00:10:22.679 --> 00:10:24.120]  Famously to Owen Schroer.
[00:10:26.596 --> 00:10:27.377]  There's no logic.
[00:10:27.837 --> 00:10:28.817]  There's no truth in them.
[00:10:29.178 --> 00:10:35.702]  There's only the emotion that they went to community college and they were told they were part of a communist uprising and they had power.
[00:10:36.883 --> 00:10:44.108]  And they were converted over as radicals in that movement believing that some amazing future was coming to them.
[00:10:44.148 --> 00:10:50.052]  But all that's coming to them is death of the engine of freedom.
[00:10:50.952 --> 00:10:56.096]  Our free market capitalist system that's been cronyistic and that has had its problems.
[00:10:57.622 --> 00:11:06.795]  But compared to the other kleptocracies, has been the greatest launch point for human invention and human ingenuity and human ideas and a better way of life.
[00:11:08.478 --> 00:11:13.825]  But that better way of life took us off the land, it domesticated us and created spoiled brats.
[00:11:16.209 --> 00:11:23.651]  My dad was raised on a farm and a ranch, and he knows how to do everything from electricity to butchering a cow to roofing a house.
[00:11:24.211 --> 00:11:36.273]  I know a fraction of that, and I'll tell you, my children are good, and they help clean the house and do things like that, but they are domesticated compared to me, compared to my dad, or compared to his dad.
[00:11:37.134 --> 00:11:38.514]  And you go and you look,
[00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:43.732]  That the people in the inner cities, black, white, old, young, it doesn't matter.
[00:11:43.952 --> 00:11:46.613]  They are totally bathed in brainwashing.
[00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:49.915]  They are immersed in communist ideology.
[00:11:50.535 --> 00:11:54.377]  They are totally disconnected from reality.
[00:11:54.417 --> 00:11:57.799]  And if you go to a Democrat event, everybody's seen the videos.
[00:11:58.799 --> 00:12:08.184]  It is so sad how soul-sucked and how physically dead-eyed all of the people are.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.660]  You ask yourself, what happened to them?
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:12.741]  There's no energy.
[00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:14.741]  There's no life in them.
[00:12:15.981 --> 00:12:22.643]  There's only an idea that they're going to go out and they're going to conquest the country by burning down their own neighborhoods.
[00:12:25.543 --> 00:12:33.925]  And that's all it is, is a bunch of welfare heads that have got their college degree and have been promised
[00:12:34.861 --> 00:12:35.341]  The end game...
[00:13:04.363 --> 00:13:05.263]  Death for everybody.
[00:13:07.324 --> 00:13:12.606]  And this is a game, ladies and gentlemen, that you do not want to play.
[00:13:13.246 --> 00:13:17.788]  And there's no doubt that there's a thousand flavors of BS out there, but this is the truth.
[00:13:18.508 --> 00:13:19.808]  This is how the world really works.
[00:13:19.888 --> 00:13:21.029]  We've really done the studying.
[00:13:21.069 --> 00:13:22.149]  We know who the players are.
[00:13:22.909 --> 00:13:24.910]  This is what the New World Order looks like.
[00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:30.692]  And we know what the New World Order looks like, ladies and gentlemen, because they've told us what it is.
[00:13:30.932 --> 00:13:33.373]  They're very arrogant about it at the academic level.
[00:13:34.266 --> 00:13:45.684]  And they talk in Hillary Clinton's emails about her dumb anti-fud baristas that think they're going to rule and how they're going to be rudely awakened when they learn that they've been used to just bring the country down.
[00:13:47.915 --> 00:14:01.843]  So when you see these people, you have to remember, they are mainly hired thugs and meth heads at the lowest level, then they're washed out community college students, and then they're academics above that, and then above that they are governors, they are U.S.
[00:14:01.883 --> 00:14:11.048]  senators, they are the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Soroses, literally funding these people to absolutely hate
[00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.623]  The very existence of America itself.
[00:14:15.743 --> 00:14:20.067]  That's why Antifa is an international terror group now firebombing U.S.
[00:14:20.147 --> 00:14:20.568]  embassies.
[00:14:21.929 --> 00:14:24.852]  Because they are a conquering ideology.
[00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:28.575]  They believe they have a right to rule.
[00:14:29.116 --> 00:14:30.157]  This is go time.
[00:14:30.537 --> 00:14:31.858]  Worldwide revolution.
[00:14:32.539 --> 00:14:37.564]  And Trump's big crime is he's not a globalist and he wasn't going to sit idly by
[00:14:40.404 --> 00:14:59.456]  While the Chinese Communist Century continue to oppress the Chinese people, takes over Hong Kong, takes over Taiwan, takes over Africa, has giant open-air death camps everywhere, begins to take over our country, our universities, our way of life as the model of what the future is here on the anniversary of Tiananmen Square.
[00:15:01.017 --> 00:15:03.219]  So, Tom Cotton, send in the troops.
[00:15:03.419 --> 00:15:05.160]  We're going to get into his report.
[00:15:06.479 --> 00:15:07.359]  And what he's talking about.
[00:15:07.619 --> 00:15:09.760]  We're being put into artificial martial law.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:11.380]  We're being put into civil war.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:14.741]  We're being put into lack of law and order.
[00:15:15.961 --> 00:15:19.942]  So that Trump can be run out of office like Chel Chesky, but he's not a dictator.
[00:15:20.902 --> 00:15:24.583]  This is a leftist, foundation-run CIA coup.
[00:15:25.063 --> 00:15:31.145]  That's why they have all these leftist CIA people going, we're very worried at the CIA that Trump's planning to be a dictator.
[00:15:31.205 --> 00:15:33.486]  No, you're the ones trying to overthrow elections.
[00:15:33.806 --> 00:15:35.086]  You're the ones that tried to have the
[00:15:36.844 --> 00:15:39.566]  You're the ones that have been caught red-handed.
[00:15:41.347 --> 00:15:42.288]  And they're not giving up.
[00:15:42.328 --> 00:15:46.550]  They're more dangerous today than they were six months ago before they were caught red-handed.
[00:15:48.852 --> 00:15:56.717]  So, Limbaugh yesterday was saying everything we told you three years ago about wiretaps on Trump and the silent coup run by Obama and how dangerous it is.
[00:15:57.497 --> 00:15:59.619]  Well, we can't wait three years this time to wake up.
[00:16:00.059 --> 00:16:02.981]  I'm gonna tell you what's coming next, not what happened three years ago.
[00:16:03.481 --> 00:16:04.582]  That's what we do here.
[00:16:04.942 --> 00:16:05.903]  Nothing against Limbaugh.
[00:16:07.116 --> 00:16:09.417]  It's good to see that he's finally figured everything out.
[00:16:10.097 --> 00:16:14.098]  But now we've got to expose the next phase of the enemy operation before it's too late.
[00:16:15.699 --> 00:16:17.239]  You are the one they called President?
[00:16:18.279 --> 00:16:18.539]  I am.
[00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:25.602]  Kneel before Zod.
[00:16:25.622 --> 00:16:26.882]  Kneel before Zod!
[00:16:36.582 --> 00:16:37.482]  You are not the president.
[00:16:38.463 --> 00:16:41.785]  No one who leads so many could possibly kneel so quickly.
[00:16:43.225 --> 00:16:44.486]  I'm the man they're protecting.
[00:16:44.566 --> 00:16:46.767]  I'm the president.
[00:17:12.059 --> 00:17:20.822]  Throughout history and every culture, when you are a slave, or when you are bowing to your master or your god, you kneel.
[00:17:20.842 --> 00:17:25.804]  It was all choreographed.
[00:17:27.024 --> 00:17:34.266]  First you kneel saying you don't respect the flag of the country you live in, that it's a bad place, you're affiliated with Xi Jinping.
[00:17:35.147 --> 00:17:36.207]  That's not financed at all.
[00:17:38.048 --> 00:17:38.488]  But now,
[00:17:39.755 --> 00:17:50.520]  You kneel to show your solidarity and that you're not a racist, but then all it does is cause more burning, more attacks, more death.
[00:17:55.182 --> 00:17:57.182]  What are we going to do?
[00:17:58.583 --> 00:18:00.664]  How far are we going to bow?
[00:18:01.924 --> 00:18:05.246]  And does bowing ever elicit anyone's respect?
[00:18:09.111 --> 00:18:17.914]  Anyone that asks you to bow to them, that's not your god that you choose to bow to, is beyond a tyrant.
[00:18:20.475 --> 00:18:23.736]  What they are, is cult leaders!
[00:18:25.297 --> 00:18:30.239]  And that is exactly what the entire New World Order is.
[00:18:31.972 --> 00:18:36.513]  A religion of hating yourself because you're a human, you're bad for the earth.
[00:18:37.053 --> 00:18:38.753]  If you're white, because you're a racist.
[00:18:39.473 --> 00:18:42.454]  If you're straight, because you were not cool.
[00:18:44.114 --> 00:18:45.035]  Because you're having children.
[00:18:46.015 --> 00:18:51.556]  You're being taught to have a new religion, to join a suicide cult.
[00:18:52.776 --> 00:18:57.157]  The only thing missing in these new, quote, anti-God prayer vigils
[00:18:59.404 --> 00:19:01.566]  is drinking the Kool-Aid.
[00:19:01.726 --> 00:19:02.066]  All right.
[00:19:03.968 --> 00:19:05.009]  Let's get into it right now.
[00:19:05.109 --> 00:19:16.518]  Well, Drew Brees came out and, you know, said, listen, I'm not going to kneel when the American flag's out because my grandfathers were in World War II, and I think America's good.
[00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:20.441]  Well, Twitter banned him for that, blocked his video.
[00:19:20.501 --> 00:19:22.182]  Everybody else came out and attacked him.
[00:19:22.742 --> 00:19:23.743]  The corporate world did.
[00:19:24.264 --> 00:19:25.565]  And so he said, I'm sorry.
[00:19:26.285 --> 00:19:26.926]  I will bow.
[00:19:29.136 --> 00:19:29.977]  I will kneel now.
[00:19:29.997 --> 00:19:32.199]  I hate the flag.
[00:19:32.239 --> 00:19:33.460]  I mean, he didn't actually say that.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:34.081]  He said, I'm sorry.
[00:19:34.121 --> 00:19:34.782]  I was insensitive.
[00:19:34.822 --> 00:19:35.542]  I didn't understand it.
[00:19:36.003 --> 00:19:38.025]  I just meant I was proud of America, but I'm sorry.
[00:19:38.045 --> 00:19:39.506]  I denounce myself.
[00:19:39.546 --> 00:19:40.047]  You're right.
[00:19:40.107 --> 00:19:40.547]  You're right.
[00:19:40.888 --> 00:19:45.973]  This is all part of us being trained that we're bad.
[00:19:47.034 --> 00:19:49.856]  And once they've done that, now you've got to follow their political will.
[00:19:49.876 --> 00:19:52.539]  And it's not black people that you're going to be serving.
[00:19:52.559 --> 00:19:53.240]  That's a joke.
[00:19:54.764 --> 00:19:57.865]  It's the globalists, it's the academics that were promised all the control.
[00:19:58.145 --> 00:20:00.206]  They're the priesthood of the new system.
[00:20:01.547 --> 00:20:07.089]  So CNN had one of these globalist big foundation paid hacks on, and it was all a setup.
[00:20:07.129 --> 00:20:09.310]  They're like, well, what about children?
[00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:10.651]  What should be happening in schools?
[00:20:10.791 --> 00:20:12.752]  Well, we need to teach the white children.
[00:20:13.112 --> 00:20:14.092]  They're inherently bad.
[00:20:16.413 --> 00:20:23.016]  And my 12-year-old daughter said, yeah, dad, everywhere online and in the academic stuff, it's saying whites are inherently bad.
[00:20:24.773 --> 00:20:25.674]  Think about that!
[00:20:25.774 --> 00:20:32.179]  Teaching children, never done anything in their life, because the color of their skin, they're bad, and that's the left, that's the globalist.
[00:20:34.140 --> 00:20:45.430]  The complete opposite of Martin Luther King, who just stated, what was already known, that you should judge people off the character and the content of their deeds, not off what color they are, but all of that's being thrown away.
[00:20:47.531 --> 00:20:51.675]  For the New World Order, CNN, white children don't deserve innocence.
[00:20:52.671 --> 00:20:59.441]  And the left's all about getting rid of the age of consent, drugging children, getting them to take vaccines outside their parents' wishes.
[00:20:59.501 --> 00:21:01.645]  It's about killing innocence.
[00:21:01.725 --> 00:21:02.606]  What does evil want?
[00:21:04.709 --> 00:21:05.210]  Innocence.
[00:21:06.527 --> 00:21:07.367]  What does it target?
[00:21:07.587 --> 00:21:08.067]  Innocence.
[00:21:08.407 --> 00:21:09.327]  What does it want to destroy?
[00:21:09.608 --> 00:21:10.088]  Innocence.
[00:21:10.368 --> 00:21:20.069]  Because innocence is the genesis of you opening up to the universe and God, and discovering the universe yourself, and having that communion.
[00:21:20.369 --> 00:21:29.851]  But if they can't get in front of that first, and teach people to hate themselves, well they're gonna fail.
[00:21:30.191 --> 00:21:35.672]  These people are pure psychological warfare evil, and they know they are.
[00:21:37.824 --> 00:21:43.567]  The environmental movement's about stealing property, and controlling everyone, and shutting down industry, and only allowing their industry.
[00:21:43.827 --> 00:21:44.748]  They know that.
[00:21:44.808 --> 00:21:45.428]  They admit that.
[00:21:46.069 --> 00:21:53.613]  The whole race-based system is in Hillary's WikiLeaks, where she's talking to a top professor of psychology, and they go, the only answer is to intensify culture war.
[00:21:53.933 --> 00:21:54.974]  And that's what you're seeing.
[00:21:57.195 --> 00:22:04.099]  And these idiots play along with it because they're followers, because they think it's empowering them, because the media pats them on the head.
[00:22:04.359 --> 00:22:05.920]  It's up to us who are leaders.
[00:22:07.756 --> 00:22:11.239]  Who have red blood to say no to this cult takeover.
[00:22:11.599 --> 00:22:29.773]  Here's CNN saying we've got to indoctrinate children and teach them to hate themselves and have low self esteems and to follow orders and to prove to the new church of the new world order that they atone for their original sin, the new religion, the priesthood.
[00:22:29.993 --> 00:22:30.454]  Here it is.
[00:22:31.325 --> 00:22:45.952]  I think the important thing for white parents to keep in the front of our mind is that if black children in this country are not allowed innocence and childhood without fear of being killed by police or marginalized in some other way, then our children don't deserve innocence.
[00:22:46.012 --> 00:22:59.459]  If Tamir Rice can be shot dead in a public park playing with a toy gun, something white children do all over this country every day without the same fear of being shot, if Tamir Rice can be killed, then white children need to be told at least at the same age.
[00:22:59.819 --> 00:23:02.261]  If they can't be innocent, we don't get to be innocent.
[00:23:02.281 --> 00:23:10.105]  And if we would keep that in the front of our minds, then perhaps we would be able to hear what black and brown folks are telling us every day and have been for many years.
[00:23:10.125 --> 00:23:13.768]  So what he's saying is, if you buy his premise, human sacrifice.
[00:23:14.548 --> 00:23:17.590]  If somebody did something wrong a thousand miles away, let's do something wrong here.
[00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:20.592]  There's lots of white kids get shot with guns that look real.
[00:23:20.612 --> 00:23:23.314]  That's why they make all the kids toys bright orange now.
[00:23:23.634 --> 00:23:28.457]  There's 250 million people, a few kids get shot a year with toy guns.
[00:23:30.052 --> 00:23:32.993]  And it's all police are bad, all whites are bad.
[00:23:33.633 --> 00:23:48.178]  All of this is not based in logic because as Rod Serling, a true patriot, said, under a tyranny, truth is a menace and logic is the enemy.
[00:23:50.099 --> 00:23:50.459]  Logic
[00:23:51.909 --> 00:23:55.191]  Is the enemy and truth is a menace, to quote him properly.
[00:23:55.932 --> 00:23:59.674]  And that's why you look at these people, they're at war with common sense.
[00:23:59.694 --> 00:24:02.236]  In fact, bring me in the statistics from the FBI.
[00:24:02.256 --> 00:24:04.258]  10 to 1 black on white crime.
[00:24:04.278 --> 00:24:06.319]  10 to 1 on average nationwide.
[00:24:06.619 --> 00:24:08.000]  Some areas it's 30, 40 times.
[00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:15.165]  I could show you 100 videos of black people killing white people, shooting them and torturing them and beating them in the last couple weeks.
[00:24:15.866 --> 00:24:19.048]  We've barely showed it because it's still statistically very low.
[00:24:20.452 --> 00:24:21.773]  But if you want to see it, we can show it.
[00:24:22.633 --> 00:24:24.254]  Or black people killed in these riots.
[00:24:24.954 --> 00:24:30.276]  But you'll never see that on the national news because they're not humanizing it by design.
[00:24:30.596 --> 00:24:37.860]  They're creating the perception that you're guilty and you're bad, so you've got to do what the cult says and you've got to go under their control.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.182]  And these are all creepy, evil people that are doing this.
[00:24:42.402 --> 00:24:49.545]  But you don't hear a damn thing out of CNN or MSNBC who put up puff pieces for Communist China about how they have real live death camps.
[00:24:50.615 --> 00:24:54.358]  And how they won't even let black people basically into China.
[00:24:54.798 --> 00:24:57.320]  But that's okay, because only white people are bad.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.882]  What a load of BS!
[00:25:00.502 --> 00:25:02.483]  Now, when we come back, send in the troops.
[00:25:06.286 --> 00:25:08.508]  You walk into this room at your own risk.
[00:25:09.268 --> 00:25:10.669]  Because it leads to the future.
[00:25:11.430 --> 00:25:13.731]  Not a future that will be, but one that might be.
[00:25:14.872 --> 00:25:15.893]  This is not a new world.
[00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:20.392]  It is simply an extension of what began in the old one.
[00:25:21.513 --> 00:25:29.017]  It has patterned itself after every dictator who has ever planted the ripping imprint of a boot on the pages of history since the beginning of time.
[00:25:29.938 --> 00:25:36.882]  It has refinements, technological advances and a more sophisticated approach to the destruction of human freedom.
[00:25:38.003 --> 00:25:42.626]  But like every one of the super states that preceded it, it has one iron rule.
[00:25:43.726 --> 00:25:45.968]  Logic is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:53.141]  This is Mr. Romney Wordsworth.
[00:25:54.042 --> 00:25:59.706]  In his last 48 hours on Earth, he's a citizen of the state, but will soon have to be eliminated.
[00:26:00.706 --> 00:26:02.268]  Because he is built out of flesh.
[00:26:03.168 --> 00:26:04.269]  And because he has a mind.
[00:26:05.490 --> 00:26:10.133]  Mr. Romney Wordsworth, who will draw his last breaths in the Twilight Zone.
[00:26:25.046 --> 00:26:25.887]  We are back live.
[00:26:25.927 --> 00:26:27.209]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[00:26:27.249 --> 00:26:30.334]  The Attorney General, Bill Barr, is about to come out with announcements.
[00:26:31.095 --> 00:26:35.863]  They have leftist arms inside the FBI that have been setting up these right-wing provocateur groups.
[00:26:36.929 --> 00:26:37.490]  We're good to go.
[00:26:56.493 --> 00:26:58.074]  Their command and control is all public.
[00:26:58.234 --> 00:27:02.637]  Their stuff's all printed up centrally in San Francisco and New York and D.C.
[00:27:03.057 --> 00:27:03.437]  The U.N.
[00:27:03.497 --> 00:27:09.760]  is involved and we have all the internal documents as well at InfoWars.com detailing the entire battle plan.
[00:27:10.241 --> 00:27:16.364]  Documents to tell plan for civil unrest, martial law that was being run by Obama and by Brennan.
[00:27:17.744 --> 00:27:21.987]  So if you want to know who's behind all this, FBI, here it is open and shut for you.
[00:27:23.688 --> 00:27:24.228]  All right there.
[00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:30.123]  Everybody just plays dumb like we don't know who these dirtbags are.
[00:27:30.203 --> 00:27:37.068]  We've gone to cover antifa events in places like San Francisco and Berkeley, and it's run out of the college bookstore.
[00:27:37.568 --> 00:27:39.269]  I mean, they don't even hide this stuff.
[00:27:40.230 --> 00:27:42.312]  So, a bunch of former weathermen.
[00:27:42.392 --> 00:27:43.913]  I mean, who do you think runs all this?
[00:27:43.933 --> 00:27:47.035]  A bunch of foundation-funded communists.
[00:27:48.354 --> 00:27:49.655]  And they're gearing up for their big push.
[00:27:50.055 --> 00:27:51.875]  We've got fire bombings going on at U.S.
[00:27:51.935 --> 00:27:52.396]  embassies.
[00:27:52.716 --> 00:27:54.056]  We've got people getting shot and killed.
[00:27:54.076 --> 00:27:55.657]  Like, five cops killed yesterday.
[00:27:56.217 --> 00:27:58.338]  You don't even learn their names, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:28:00.178 --> 00:28:04.040]  But you sure know the guy that died in Minnesota.
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:06.161]  Okay, yeah, I'm not glad he's dead.
[00:28:06.201 --> 00:28:06.721]  Why would I be?
[00:28:07.241 --> 00:28:09.842]  The point is, is that this is the manipulation of the media.
[00:28:11.707 --> 00:28:20.535]  We've got footage of a dog being choked to death that was stolen by someone because the person was white, and the black crazy man strangling the puppy to death.
[00:28:23.878 --> 00:28:25.599]  I mean, do you blame all black people for that?
[00:28:25.659 --> 00:28:27.641]  Or do you say that it's Joe Biden's fault?
[00:28:28.542 --> 00:28:30.103]  Well, Joe Biden's been pushing the riots.
[00:28:30.163 --> 00:28:31.945]  I mean, you could say it more than it's Trump's fault.
[00:28:32.625 --> 00:28:33.506]  This is crazy.
[00:28:34.167 --> 00:28:37.730]  You've got Mattis, who I guess got his paperback book coming out, so he wants to promote it.
[00:28:40.885 --> 00:28:43.327]  Coming out saying Trump's a danger to the Constitution.
[00:28:43.867 --> 00:28:45.549]  We've been overtaken by globalists.
[00:28:45.569 --> 00:28:47.891]  We've had our sovereignty transferred out of the country.
[00:28:48.911 --> 00:28:50.893]  We've had the nation absolutely enslaved.
[00:28:54.196 --> 00:28:56.678]  Alright, here comes the Attorney General with this big announcement.
[00:28:56.718 --> 00:28:57.859]  Let's go to the Fox News feed.
[00:28:58.219 --> 00:29:02.582]  Including the protesting being co-opted by those who would turn it violent.
[00:29:02.963 --> 00:29:07.867]  But we now see the others pull into place and the Attorney General for the United States, Bill Barr.
[00:29:08.747 --> 00:29:09.228]  Everybody.
[00:29:10.694 --> 00:29:14.496]  Thank you for joining us at this remote press conference.
[00:29:17.218 --> 00:29:29.065]  Over the Constitution Avenue entrance to this building is a Latin inscription that translates, everything is created by law and order.
[00:29:31.346 --> 00:29:33.968]  That ancient principle still holds true.
[00:29:35.333 --> 00:29:37.793]  Our free society depends on the rule of law.
[00:29:38.934 --> 00:29:46.475]  The assurance that ordinary citizens can go about their lives without being subject to arbitrary violence or fear.
[00:29:47.595 --> 00:29:53.036]  When the rule of law breaks down, the promise of America does also.
[00:29:54.456 --> 00:29:59.757]  Our nation is now confronting two serious challenges to the rule of law.
[00:30:00.818 --> 00:30:02.878]  The first is a long-standing one
[00:30:04.008 --> 00:30:10.750]  But was recently crystallized and driven home by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.
[00:30:12.290 --> 00:30:17.651]  The video of the police conduct in this episode, as I said before, is harrowing.
[00:30:19.392 --> 00:30:27.374]  When you watch it and imagine that one of your own loved ones was being treated this way and begging for their lives,
[00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:35.295]  It is impossible for any normal human being not to be struck to the heart with horror.
[00:30:36.896 --> 00:30:41.839]  This matter is being pursued by both the state and the federal government.
[00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:53.468]  The state has filed, already, second degree murder charges against one of the officers and aiding and abetting charges against the other three officers.
[00:30:54.716 --> 00:31:11.006]  As we typically do in cases such as this, the Department of Justice and the FBI is conducting a parallel and independent investigation into possible violations of federal civil rights laws.
[00:31:12.347 --> 00:31:15.269]  The President has directed me to spare no effort.
[00:31:16.330 --> 00:31:22.834]  We are coordinating our work with the Attorney General of Minnesota,
[00:31:24.512 --> 00:31:33.498]  And as a matter of comedy, the Department of Justice typically lets the state go forward with its proceedings first.
[00:31:35.239 --> 00:31:49.508]  This afternoon, our United States Attorney in Minnesota and the FBI Special Agent in Charge of our Minneapolis field office, the FBI's field office, will attend a memorial service for Mr. Floyd.
[00:31:49.968 --> 00:31:52.750]  Today is a day of mourning.
[00:31:55.689 --> 00:32:01.931]  And the day is coming soon, I am confident, when justice will be served.
[00:32:03.352 --> 00:32:13.296]  George Floyd's death was not the first of its kind, and it exposes concerns that reach far beyond this particular case.
[00:32:14.690 --> 00:32:27.607]  While the vast majority of police officers do their job bravely and righteously, it is undeniable that many African Americans lack confidence in our American criminal justice system.
[00:32:27.627 --> 00:32:29.029]  You know what this is really all about, folks?
[00:32:29.369 --> 00:32:30.350]  This must change.
[00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:32.954]  In the final equation, it's going to be robots policing you.
[00:32:34.565 --> 00:32:34.866]  Watch.
[00:32:34.886 --> 00:32:39.772]  You already saw it with the COVID rollout.
[00:32:39.832 --> 00:32:42.455]  It's going to be ground robots, air robots.
[00:32:42.475 --> 00:32:43.757]  Humans are going to be taking out everything.
[00:32:43.777 --> 00:32:46.159]  It's going to be all of the robots colorblind.
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:47.141]  Watch.
[00:32:49.151 --> 00:33:04.078]  Chiefs and law enforcement officials and leaders around the country are committed to ensuring that racism plays no part in law enforcement and that everyone receives equal protection of the laws.
[00:33:05.178 --> 00:33:13.083]  In October 2019, the President established the first Commission on Law Enforcement since the 1960s.
[00:33:13.743 --> 00:33:20.227]  And I am meeting with them later this month, and I have been talking... Okay, this is live, we're going to continue to watch this.
[00:33:21.027 --> 00:33:23.629]  He said two big issues, Floyd, and the next will be Antifa.
[00:33:24.429 --> 00:33:26.150]  The looting, the criminality, the riots.
[00:33:26.631 --> 00:33:29.012]  If he hasn't gotten to that yet, when we come back, we'll just keep going.
[00:33:29.032 --> 00:33:30.733]  If not, we'll back it up here.
[00:33:30.893 --> 00:33:31.794]  We've got to go to break here.
[00:33:32.174 --> 00:33:34.156]  Radio TV stations out there have to take their breaks.
[00:33:34.196 --> 00:33:34.796]  We understand that.
[00:33:36.257 --> 00:33:41.640]  Please don't forget that we've had the biggest sale of the year yet extended now 60% off flash sale.
[00:33:41.701 --> 00:33:43.242]  A lot of stuff's very close to selling out.
[00:33:43.822 --> 00:33:50.787]  So if you want your DNA Force Plus, the PQQ and the CoQ10, if you want your X2, you want your X3, if you want your real Red Pill Plus,
[00:33:51.667 --> 00:33:53.168]  A lot of that's very close to selling out.
[00:33:53.928 --> 00:33:59.291]  We also have a lot of other great products like Boddy's Ultimate Turmeric Formula that has been sold out.

[00:34:08.295 --> 00:34:11.497]  We have to sell a lot of product though to be able

[00:34:16.015 --> 00:34:16.996]  Supermail Vitality.

[00:34:51.277 --> 00:35:01.182]  Los Angeles National Guard kneeling to the useful idiots, the antifamorons, the people wearing their stupid COVID mask.
[00:35:02.482 --> 00:35:05.083]  Notice the military is not wearing their little diaper mask anymore.
[00:35:05.103 --> 00:35:07.164]  It's all a giant hoax.
[00:35:07.204 --> 00:35:12.467]  By the way, more scientists, more governments have come out saying COVID-19 is a giant hoax.
[00:35:14.212 --> 00:35:22.116]  But it is a new virus patented and owned by a consortium of Fauci and Bill Gates and the Chinese government.
[00:35:22.596 --> 00:35:24.057]  Cannot make that up.
[00:35:25.017 --> 00:35:28.419]  And see, the crime is so big, they just think they won't get prosecuted.
[00:35:29.319 --> 00:35:32.561]  Just like Antifa is publicly funded by Alexander Soros and George Soros!
[00:35:36.937 --> 00:35:38.178]  Let's go to the Attorney General.
[00:35:38.598 --> 00:35:40.118]  As predicted, he said two things.
[00:35:40.159 --> 00:35:42.760]  You have the death of Floyd and now the lawlessness, the rioting.
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:43.820]  We'll see what he's about to announce.
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.181]  Here it is.
[00:35:45.341 --> 00:35:49.903]  ...solutions so that Mr. Floyd's death will not have been in vain.
[00:35:51.244 --> 00:35:55.826]  We will work hard to bring good out of bad.
[00:35:57.242 --> 00:36:04.206]  Unfortunately, the aftermath of George Floyd's death has produced a second challenge to the rule of law.
[00:36:05.107 --> 00:36:13.851]  While many have peacefully expressed their anger and grief, others have hijacked protests to engage in lawlessness.
[00:36:14.912 --> 00:36:24.978]  Violent rioting, arson, looting of businesses and public property, assaults on law enforcement officers and innocent people,
[00:36:25.798 --> 00:36:28.579]  And even the murder of a federal agent.
[00:36:29.939 --> 00:36:35.940]  Such senseless acts of anarchy are not exercises of First Amendment rights.
[00:36:36.301 --> 00:36:42.982]  They are crimes designed to terrify fellow citizens and intimidate communities.
[00:36:44.102 --> 00:36:45.963]  As I told the governors on Monday,
[00:36:47.023 --> 00:36:53.207]  We understand the distinction between three different sets of actors here.
[00:36:54.208 --> 00:37:03.473]  The large preponderance of those who are protesting are peaceful demonstrators who are exercising their First Amendment rights.
[00:37:03.514 --> 00:37:04.714]  And they have that to be idiots.
[00:37:04.874 --> 00:37:12.979]  At some demonstrations, however, there are groups that exploit the opportunity to engage in such crimes as looting.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:24.726]  And finally, at some demonstrations, there are extremist agitators who are hijacking the protests to pursue their own separate and violent agenda.
[00:37:25.646 --> 00:37:34.611]  We have evidence that Antifa and other similar extremist groups, as well as actors of a variety of different political persuasions,
[00:37:35.391 --> 00:37:40.716]  Have been involved in instigating and participating in the violent activity.
[00:37:41.537 --> 00:37:48.143]  And we are also seeing foreign actors playing all sides to exacerbate the violence.
[00:37:49.524 --> 00:37:56.631]  The Department of Justice is working to restore order in the District of Columbia and around the nation.
[00:37:57.697 --> 00:38:09.202]  Here in Washington, we are working with the local police, the citizen soldiers of the National Guard, and other federal agencies to provide safety and justice.
[00:38:10.203 --> 00:38:23.388]  We have deployed all the major law enforcement components of the Department on this mission, including the FBI, the ATF, the DEA, the Bureau of Prisons, and the U.S.
[00:38:23.688 --> 00:38:24.149]  Marshals.
[00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:25.649]  Service.
[00:38:26.289 --> 00:38:29.150]  Their leaders are with me today and we'll be talking shortly.
[00:38:29.910 --> 00:38:37.433]  I thank all of these leaders and their components for working bravely and professionally to protect the district.
[00:38:39.493 --> 00:38:48.156]  I'm pleased to say that, especially over the last two nights, the demonstrations, while large, have been peaceful.
[00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:58.486]  The Justice Department is also working closely with our state and local partners to address violent riots around the country.
[00:38:59.386 --> 00:39:04.390]  Our federal law enforcement efforts are focused on the violent instigators.
[00:39:06.055 --> 00:39:08.116]  Through the FBI, U.S.
[00:39:08.176 --> 00:39:21.223]  Attorney's offices, component field offices, and state and local enforcement, we are receiving real-time intelligence and we have deployed resources to quell outbreaks of violence in several places.
[00:39:22.163 --> 00:39:30.008]  I urge governors and mayors and other state and local leaders to work closely with the National Guard and with us.
[00:39:30.888 --> 00:39:39.191]  The federal government has thus far made 51 arrests for federal crimes in connection with violent rioting.
[00:39:39.852 --> 00:39:45.694]  We will continue to investigate, to make arrests, and to prosecute where warranted.
[00:39:48.115 --> 00:39:58.659]  When I was Attorney General in 1995, uh, 1992, riots broke out in Los Angeles following the acquittal by the state.
[00:39:59.787 --> 00:40:03.650]  Of police officers accused of beating Rodney King.
[00:40:05.131 --> 00:40:12.557]  Ultimately, the Department of Justice, at my direction, filed federal civil rights charges against those officers.
[00:40:14.058 --> 00:40:24.927]  As President Bush assured the nation at that time, quote, the violence will end, justice will be served, hope will return.
[00:40:25.888 --> 00:40:27.089]  The same is true today.
[00:40:28.211 --> 00:40:29.713]  The rule of law will prevail.
[00:40:30.514 --> 00:40:30.914]  Thank you.
[00:40:32.116 --> 00:40:37.863]  Now I'd like to introduce my colleague, Chris Wray, the director of the FBI.
[00:40:37.923 --> 00:40:46.614]  And I have to say, this is the FBI that I've had the pleasure of working with over the last few days, the FBI that I know and love.
[00:40:47.489 --> 00:40:47.749]  Thank you.
[00:41:08.766 --> 00:41:15.769]  We are going to deal effectively with the criminals who are involved in extremist violence.
[00:41:15.850 --> 00:41:18.251]  Okay, we'll start with George Soros to Alexander Soros.
[00:41:21.052 --> 00:41:21.412]  Obama.
[00:41:23.133 --> 00:41:25.534]  Thank you, General, for your leadership.
[00:41:26.395 --> 00:41:26.875]  Good morning.
[00:41:27.415 --> 00:41:31.377]  This is, needless to say, an incredibly challenging time for our country.
[00:41:31.677 --> 00:41:33.678]  Alright, he's going to go into some politically correct comments.
[00:41:33.738 --> 00:41:34.339]  I can't handle it.
[00:41:34.379 --> 00:41:34.899]  Just turn it off.
[00:41:36.244 --> 00:41:39.747]  The whole thing was Hollywood-produced movies.
[00:41:39.767 --> 00:41:40.908]  The Joker, all of them.
[00:41:40.968 --> 00:41:43.490]  Rob Reiner saying overthrow the government, race war.
[00:41:44.791 --> 00:41:49.014]  And I'll be talking to people, high-level defense intelligence, CIA, and they're like, how do you know this, Jones?
[00:41:49.335 --> 00:41:50.095]  How do I know it?
[00:41:50.315 --> 00:41:53.778]  They run around announcing it like a bugle charge.
[00:41:54.699 --> 00:41:55.880]  A cavalry charge.
[00:41:58.402 --> 00:42:01.805]  But everyone is in their own little bubbles, I guess, watching CNN and Fox News.
[00:42:04.295 --> 00:42:13.744]  That's why when they ran full-page ads saying overthrow the government and kill all the white people in the New York Times, they then ran articles saying Jones made it up, there's no full-page ads.
[00:42:13.984 --> 00:42:15.846]  What the hell are you talking about?
[00:42:19.149 --> 00:42:20.110]  Jones made it up.
[00:42:21.992 --> 00:42:23.133]  Antifa's not violent.
[00:42:23.794 --> 00:42:26.657]  No, Jones burned down the homeless camp.
[00:42:28.186 --> 00:42:37.132]  And they have had hundreds of TV stations and dozens of major newspapers, including international ones, run with the fact that we burned down a homeless camp last week.
[00:42:40.214 --> 00:42:44.177]  Even though we're there covering it and you see the Antifa burning it, this is the level.
[00:42:44.317 --> 00:42:46.498]  Our media is allied with this.
[00:42:46.778 --> 00:42:47.879]  This is what they want.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:54.503]  And if people continue to be naive about all this, we don't have a prayer in hell.
[00:42:54.623 --> 00:42:56.805]  We told you who was spying on Trump.
[00:42:58.215 --> 00:43:05.399]  Who the moles were, who the infiltrators were, the fake FISA court, we broke the Nunes memo, we broke everything.
[00:43:07.721 --> 00:43:10.743]  Because we research, we know what we're talking about.
[00:43:14.825 --> 00:43:18.347]  People think in government because they've got security clearances, they're finding stuff out.
[00:43:18.587 --> 00:43:21.609]  What about who flew into a country or maybe you can dial into somebody's computer?
[00:43:21.889 --> 00:43:24.451]  How about you actually study what the criminals are up to?
[00:43:25.771 --> 00:43:26.532]  And listen to them.
[00:43:28.544 --> 00:43:33.254]  Bill Gates says they're going to set up a world government and reduce the population to 500 million in public statements.
[00:43:33.594 --> 00:43:34.456]  Do you care about that?
[00:43:35.529 --> 00:43:46.593]  Bill Gates publicly funded at least 14 operations at the Wuhan laboratory, including 5 to create a vaccine for a weaponized coronavirus with Fauci.
[00:43:47.233 --> 00:43:56.977]  Of course the head of MI6 just came out and said it's obviously man-made out of the Wuhan lab, released on purpose to destabilize the planet, because that's what it is.
[00:43:57.837 --> 00:44:01.799]  And the sooner people start waking up, the better.
[00:44:04.468 --> 00:44:07.850]  Oh yeah, Bill Gates's vaccines are basically killing the people they're testing them on.
[00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:13.512]  We told you all this that's now breaking in January.
[00:44:14.032 --> 00:44:16.013]  Because we know who to watch.
[00:44:16.373 --> 00:44:20.595]  I didn't just start picking on Bill Gates 20-something years ago because I felt like it.
[00:44:22.236 --> 00:44:24.337]  I thought he was the Microsoft guy 25 years ago.
[00:44:24.657 --> 00:44:26.578]  I knew he had an antitrust investigation.
[00:44:26.678 --> 00:44:28.039]  I knew he was a little smartass.
[00:44:29.616 --> 00:44:31.116]  Everybody knew the guy was bad news.
[00:44:31.557 --> 00:44:38.079]  And then I started researching the New World Order, and every time I kicked open some door, there he was at the center of the spiderweb.
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:45.941]  And so, everybody can keep being naive at the FBI and the CIA, and the public can keep being naive.
[00:44:46.601 --> 00:44:47.542]  At your own peril!
[00:44:48.962 --> 00:44:51.483]  Because everybody thinks, oh, we'll beat these leftist rioters, blah, blah, blah.
[00:44:51.643 --> 00:44:53.443]  There's powerful evil behind them.
[00:44:53.624 --> 00:44:56.044]  The CHICOMs, the globalists, they're making their move.
[00:44:56.344 --> 00:44:57.745]  They're just probing right now!
[00:44:59.039 --> 00:45:01.722]  They've got thousands of public officials they're planning to kill!
[00:45:01.742 --> 00:45:05.607]  And I guess you're all just gonna sit there and let them do it!
[00:45:06.428 --> 00:45:10.032]  But I'll tell you this, the party's over for all you candy asses!
[00:45:10.272 --> 00:45:11.454]  The party's over!
[00:45:11.714 --> 00:45:13.136]  Hour 2 straight ahead!
[00:45:14.161 --> 00:45:35.588]  Those of you truly protesting for reforms due to a sometimes brutal and racial profiling law enforcement enormity, do you realize that your message has been hijacked by systemic Marxism and a Black Lives Matter movement that is just a weaponized, open society, elitist, democratic class warfare subterfuge?
[00:45:36.089 --> 00:45:39.970]  These are puppets that have been put in front of the Negro community by white liberals.
[00:45:40.922 --> 00:45:44.867]  These are parents that have been put in front of the Negro community by white liberals.
[00:45:44.907 --> 00:45:50.555]  You can't name me, a Negro leader who has betrayed Negroes, who has not been endorsed.
[00:45:54.827 --> 00:45:59.249]  Sanctioned, subsidized, and supported by the white liberals.
[00:45:59.689 --> 00:46:11.494]  Those of you protesting, do you realize that you are in the streets working to restore trust between the police and your communities while the rest of America has lost its trust in you?
[00:46:11.814 --> 00:46:20.177]  In fact, a new morning consult poll finds that 58% of Americans want the military brought in, with 30% opposing the measure.
[00:46:21.738 --> 00:46:28.343]  Would George Floyd agree that his life is more important than that of 77-year-old retired St.
[00:46:28.403 --> 00:46:38.691]  Louis Police Chief David Dorn, whose tragic murder was streamed out on Facebook Live after he had gone out to check on a friend's pawn shop and was killed by looters?
[00:46:39.011 --> 00:46:40.392]  I want some TVs, cuz!
[00:46:40.853 --> 00:46:41.653]  Come on, cuz!
[00:46:42.414 --> 00:46:43.094]  Come on, man!
[00:46:43.115 --> 00:46:44.295]  We're battling this, cuz!
[00:46:44.996 --> 00:46:46.117]  I want a TV, cuz!
[00:46:46.966 --> 00:47:08.018]  Would George Floyd agree that his life is more important than that of 53-year-old federal law enforcement officer Patrick Underwood, or 53-year-old Louisville barbecue man James McAtee, or 22-year-old Iowan Italian Marie Kelly, or the other people who have died as a result of the swirling inertia of the chaotic protests?
[00:47:08.298 --> 00:47:13.281]  How many people need to die in the protests' wake before you get your point across?
[00:47:13.581 --> 00:47:15.923]  And haven't you already gotten your point across?
[00:47:16.203 --> 00:47:24.628]  Would George Floyd agree that the price of his death adds up to the shooting of two Las Vegas cops, the shooting of four cops in St.
[00:47:24.668 --> 00:47:43.441]  Louis, the running over of police in Buffalo and Philadelphia, or the brutal beatings of innocent people desperately trying to protect their businesses, the destruction of which destroys the lives of innocent people connected to those businesses either by employment, community, or family?
[00:47:43.781 --> 00:47:44.922]  People work too hard!
[00:47:45.282 --> 00:47:45.742]  Too hard!
[00:47:46.082 --> 00:47:49.164]  You ain't gonna do it in front of me!
[00:47:49.244 --> 00:47:50.685]  Black Lives Matter!
[00:47:50.825 --> 00:47:51.245]  You lied!
[00:47:51.285 --> 00:47:53.546]  You wanted to looter the store!
[00:47:53.586 --> 00:47:54.667]  You needed money!
[00:47:55.287 --> 00:47:56.208]  Get a job!
[00:47:56.608 --> 00:47:58.009]  Like I do!
[00:47:58.049 --> 00:47:58.929]  Stop stealing!
[00:47:58.949 --> 00:48:01.190]  This is the neighborhood!
[00:48:01.230 --> 00:48:04.212]  We're trying to build it up, and you're tearing it down!
[00:48:04.512 --> 00:48:20.388]  Would George Floyd approve of the Jonestown-esque white guilt displays as hordes of leftists succumb to a form of Stockholm Syndrome from the Black Lives Matter inquisitors who use their programmed white members as sacrificial lambs?
[00:48:20.668 --> 00:48:28.236]  And those of you protesting, do you realize that your movement is actually a depraved me-me generation cry for help?
[00:48:28.376 --> 00:48:34.362]  Who are superimposing your spurious claims of racism over your raging mommy and daddy issues.
[00:48:34.662 --> 00:48:43.310]  The leftist media won't tell you that 2020 has actually been a banner year when it comes to death by cop according to race statistics.
[00:48:43.470 --> 00:48:45.912]  The numbers are way down for everyone.
[00:48:46.092 --> 00:48:51.597]  But in previous years, half the amount of black people were killed compared to white people.
[00:48:51.818 --> 00:48:53.139]  As Newsmax reported in 2019,
[00:48:54.500 --> 00:49:09.025]  Out of the 30 to 50 million interactions that police had with the American public last year, 2018, 10 million people were arrested and less than 0.01% were shot and killed by the police.
[00:49:09.365 --> 00:49:16.547]  Out of those 10 million people arrested, 47 of those shot and killed were unarmed, which equates to 0.00047%.
[00:49:20.888 --> 00:49:21.909]  17 of which were black.
[00:49:22.069 --> 00:49:25.350]  The circumstances of which are open to discussion.
[00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:41.915]  But since whites consist of 62% of the population and blacks make up 13% of the population, as the Wall Street Journal wrote in 2009, statistics from the Bureau of Justice reveal that blacks were charged with 62% of robberies, 57% of murders, and 45% of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country.
[00:49:46.917 --> 00:49:50.941]  Despite only comprising around 15% of the population in these counties.
[00:49:51.261 --> 00:50:01.930]  Such a concentration of criminal violence in minority communities means that officers will be disproportionately confronting armed and often resisting suspects in those communities.
[00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:07.214]  Raising officers own risk of using lethal force according to the Daily Wire.
[00:50:07.535 --> 00:50:13.019]  Those of you protesting, shouldn't we be working harder to address the root of those statistics?
[00:50:14.238 --> 00:50:20.680]  It has been said by many a historian and military planner that the United States could not be invaded by an outside power.
[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:25.842]  Was that what Yamamoto said the day after he attacked Pearl Harbor?
[00:50:27.363 --> 00:50:35.946]  I fear we've awakened a sleeping giant and if we are forced to invade the mainland, there will be a rifle behind every blade of grass.
[00:50:36.986 --> 00:50:39.207]  But if you can rot the insides of a country,
[00:50:40.276 --> 00:50:50.598]  If you can turn the people against each other, if you can drive God and morality out of the schools, if you can dumb the people down, if you can break up the families, you can do that.
[00:50:51.539 --> 00:51:06.062]  And if you look at sociology, anthropology, and psychology, and I've done quite a study of it, anyone can pull these numbers up yourself, the black community in the United States under segregation, which was another evil, per capita had lower
[00:51:08.382 --> 00:51:08.702]  I think?
[00:51:29.485 --> 00:51:32.928]  Desegregation came in, supposedly to replace an evil.
[00:51:33.788 --> 00:51:35.269]  It destroyed all those communities.
[00:51:35.650 --> 00:51:40.513]  And then they came in in the 60s and said, we'll pay women not to have a man in the house and to have children.
[00:51:42.335 --> 00:51:46.157]  Well, no matter where you are in the world, you take the father out of the home or the mother.
[00:51:47.118 --> 00:51:51.661]  Statistically, everything collapses and you have three to four times more likely to be in prison.
[00:51:52.222 --> 00:51:55.885]  Then you get generations, three of them now, trained in prison
[00:51:57.017 --> 00:52:11.952]  And you've got MTV, and I've talked to high-level MTV executives that were retired and major rock stars who were told in the 80s, you put out gangster rap and kill the cop rap as heavy metal people and as rock stars, or we're not going to play on MTV.
[00:52:13.149 --> 00:52:28.113]  Back then MTV was king, and that's why suddenly you saw everybody doing a song with hip-hop folks who were calling for kill the cops, you know, down with the cops, inward, with attitude, all that stuff was being force-fed to get rid of the rap and hip-hop.
[00:52:28.153 --> 00:52:38.876]  It was about empowering the community and coming together to put in death rap to teach the young people to dress like thugs, act like thugs, attack the police, and induct them right into the prisons.
[00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:40.896]  And it was the Clintons.
[00:52:41.036 --> 00:52:54.639]  And it was then, of course, good old Joe Biden that got the laws in that gave black people, if they were caught with cocaine, three to five times the sentences of white people.
[00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:58.260]  And it was the CIA that brought the drugs in to do it all.
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:59.980]  And boy, did it work.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.641]  Black community wrecked.
[00:53:01.801 --> 00:53:03.381]  Almost 80% illegitimacy.
[00:53:04.701 --> 00:53:05.501]  Total crime.
[00:53:05.581 --> 00:53:05.861]  Death.
[00:53:06.442 --> 00:53:07.922]  And now it's happening to all communities.
[00:53:09.224 --> 00:53:10.904]  What you see done to the black community will be done to you.
[00:53:10.984 --> 00:53:21.568]  And it's the very same liberal leftist, led by LBJ, who said, we're going to get this great society passed and I'll have those N-words voting Democrats for a hundred years.
[00:53:23.608 --> 00:53:27.529]  And of course, LBJ was in the KKK.
[00:53:29.890 --> 00:53:32.711]  And so was Senator Byrd and all the mentors of the Clintons.
[00:53:33.911 --> 00:53:35.011]  These folks know what they're doing.
[00:53:35.391 --> 00:53:37.172]  I mean, they're not been in charge for no reason.
[00:53:38.464 --> 00:53:41.226]  And let me tell you something, the KKK doesn't like poor white people than anybody.
[00:53:41.286 --> 00:53:44.348]  It plays everybody off against each other, and they know what they're doing.
[00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:48.111]  There it is.
[00:53:51.853 --> 00:53:52.674]  Sorry, I said 200 years.
[00:53:52.694 --> 00:53:52.994]  You're right.
[00:53:53.014 --> 00:53:53.534]  That's the actual.
[00:53:53.554 --> 00:53:56.296]  That's in the archives down at the LBJ Center in Austin.
[00:53:57.117 --> 00:53:58.337]  That letter is in the archives.
[00:54:00.739 --> 00:54:02.280]  And let me tell you, it works like a charm, doesn't it?
[00:54:03.901 --> 00:54:05.082]  Works like a charm.
[00:54:07.093 --> 00:54:18.921]  Longtime Trump doubles the amount of funding to black colleges, orders all these factories built in black neighborhoods, says incentivize to hire black people, and they're trying to destroy him because they've got a game plan.
[00:54:19.382 --> 00:54:28.008]  Now at the end of this report that's at man.video, click the left-hand tab, you'll see the John Bowne section, got a very important report he put out.
[00:54:31.021 --> 00:54:37.045]  Title protests the protests and at the end of it he shows these crime statistics of 10 to 1 black on white crime.
[00:54:40.027 --> 00:54:47.993]  And the reality that any black people now that try to get black folks out of this well like the police captain gets shot dead because you're working for the man.
[00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:55.321]  You really think the average white person wants to keep black people poor and impoverished and falling apart?
[00:54:55.361 --> 00:54:56.181]  That's not good for anybody.
[00:54:56.621 --> 00:54:57.622]  Except the Democrats.
[00:54:57.982 --> 00:55:00.083]  That's why they build Planned Parenthoods in your neighborhood.
[00:55:00.383 --> 00:55:04.644]  That's why they're always shooting their mouths off, admitting all this.
[00:55:04.964 --> 00:55:06.025]  These people are evil.
[00:55:06.065 --> 00:55:09.506]  Like Governor Northam is going to take down a statue of Robert E. Lee.
[00:55:10.966 --> 00:55:13.148]  Who Eisenhower said he respected more than anybody.
[00:55:13.548 --> 00:55:16.571]  Who the British military respects to this day, they think, as a top general.
[00:55:16.891 --> 00:55:18.792]  The guy was in the Army of the North.
[00:55:19.053 --> 00:55:21.274]  He resigned because of war crimes by the North.
[00:55:21.735 --> 00:55:23.776]  And he went and fought an army five times his size.
[00:55:24.477 --> 00:55:25.417]  Not about slavery.
[00:55:26.098 --> 00:55:31.362]  They're pulling his statue down in Virginia, the governor's announced, in a couple months to cause a riot.
[00:55:33.423 --> 00:55:34.324]  It's disgusting.
[00:55:34.544 --> 00:55:36.386]  And now they want George Washington's statue.
[00:55:37.588 --> 00:55:38.851]  They want them all, folks!
[00:55:39.693 --> 00:55:43.260]  It's all about getting rid of America and making you hate your country.
[00:55:44.763 --> 00:55:45.926]  Here's the end of Jon Bowne's report.
[00:55:45.946 --> 00:55:46.768]  It deserves to be seen.
[00:55:46.948 --> 00:55:47.229]  Here it is.
[00:55:49.462 --> 00:56:03.129]  And those of you protesting, do you realize that your movement is actually a depraved me-me generation cry for help who are superimposing your spurious claims of racism over your raging mommy and daddy issues?
[00:56:03.429 --> 00:56:12.074]  The leftist media won't tell you that 2020 has actually been a banner year when it comes to death by cop according to race statistics.
[00:56:12.234 --> 00:56:14.655]  The numbers are way down for everyone.
[00:56:14.855 --> 00:56:20.342]  But in previous years, half the amount of black people were killed compared to white people.
[00:56:20.583 --> 00:56:29.675]  As Newsmax reported in 2019, out of the 30 to 50 million interactions that police had with the American public last year, 2018,
[00:56:31.136 --> 00:56:37.819]  10 million people were arrested, and less than 0.01% were shot and killed by the police.
[00:56:38.119 --> 00:56:48.804]  Out of those 10 million people arrested, 47 of those shot and killed were unarmed, which equates to 0.00047%, 17 of which were black, the circumstances of which are open to discussion.
[00:56:54.326 --> 00:57:13.583]  But since whites consist of 62% of the population and blacks make up 13% of the population, as the Wall Street Journal wrote in 2009, statistics from the Bureau of Justice reveal that blacks were charged with 62% of robberies, 57% of murders, and 45% of assaults in the 75 biggest counties in the country, despite only comprising around 15% of the population in these counties.
[00:57:20.029 --> 00:57:35.958]  Such a concentration of criminal violence in minority communities means that officers will be disproportionately confronting armed and often resisting suspects in those communities, raising officers' own risk of using lethal force, according to the Daily Wire.
[00:57:36.299 --> 00:57:49.026]  Those of you protesting, shouldn't we be working harder to address the root of those statistics, as three and a half years of President Trump's policies have done, compared to the decades of nothing from his predecessors?
[00:57:49.386 --> 00:57:50.026]  This is history.
[00:57:50.086 --> 00:57:52.367]  Right now, you're witnessing history on the floor of the U.S.
[00:57:52.387 --> 00:57:53.568]  Senate.
[00:57:53.608 --> 00:58:07.213]  A Christmas miracle underway, where for the first time in a generation, Republicans and Democrats are arm-in-arm tonight saying, we are sending too many people to prison, they're coming out bitter and not better, we want to make a tremendous difference.
[00:58:07.593 --> 00:58:16.097]  I want to say, Hakeem Jeffries on the left, Jared Kushner and Donald Trump on the right have brought together a coalition like I've never seen.
[00:58:16.317 --> 00:58:19.140]  In December, President Trump signed the First Step Act.
[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:25.246]  It eased mandatory minimum drug sentences and led to Charles' release from prison again.
[00:58:25.826 --> 00:58:27.448]  How do you feel about President Trump?
[00:58:27.928 --> 00:58:32.252]  I'm very honored and grateful that he was, you know, signed the First Step Act.
[00:58:32.673 --> 00:58:35.736]  So, I have nothing but respect and thankfulness.
[00:58:35.936 --> 00:58:44.262]  Well, we know that during the campaign, he said, look, I'm going to put $100 billion into the inner cities over the next eight years.
[00:58:44.642 --> 00:58:48.765]  Not only that, school choice is going to be on the table, not just for African-Americans.
[00:58:48.985 --> 00:58:54.648]  But of course, Trump has already delivered on almost all of that, and so now he is the devil and must be removed, the Democrats are telling you.
[00:58:55.029 --> 00:59:01.353]  Oh, and what else don't they tell you in those statistics where you've got 60 plus percent of the crime being black?
[00:59:02.625 --> 00:59:08.149]  If you look at the numbers, over 80% of it is between about the ages of 10 and 18.
[00:59:09.550 --> 00:59:11.391]  And most of that is 13 to 16.
[00:59:12.412 --> 00:59:12.852]  Look it up.
[00:59:13.452 --> 00:59:22.919]  It is brainwashed gangbanger kids that have been put in juvenile hall controlled by older gang members that use them as soldiers on the streets to enforce criminal activity.
[00:59:23.399 --> 00:59:28.163]  And now you see the MS-13 coming in with Hispanic folks and the low-level soldiers are
[00:59:28.903 --> 00:59:29.764]  Again, in their teens.
[00:59:30.264 --> 00:59:32.345]  This is criminal operations.
[00:59:32.806 --> 00:59:34.046]  They feed on the black community.
[00:59:34.066 --> 00:59:35.107]  They feed on all communities.
[00:59:35.447 --> 00:59:39.330]  And it's wrong, but you won't hear a damn thing out of Van Jones or anybody about that.
[00:59:39.370 --> 00:59:43.593]  And now Van Jones says America is irrevocably broke and that all whites have a virus.
[00:59:44.571 --> 00:59:57.303]  So he had to admit that Trump was trying to really be this great guy back then, but he knows you don't have a memory, and now he says Trump's the leader of the KKK, when Van Jones literally knows he's there to control black people, keep them suppressed and dominated.
[00:59:57.544 --> 00:59:58.445]  He's paid to do it.
[00:59:58.725 --> 00:59:59.506]  That's his job.
[01:00:00.166 --> 01:00:01.107]  That's why he's still alive.
[01:00:01.167 --> 01:00:02.048]  Malcolm X is dead.
[01:00:02.088 --> 01:00:02.709]  We'll be right back.
[01:00:04.330 --> 01:00:06.813]  The United States is under attack.
[01:00:08.038 --> 01:00:12.043]  Our country's not perfect, but it's our nation and has a Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:00:12.103 --> 01:00:20.894]  It's been very successful and has been the number one country where the average person has a chance to become successful and to become happy and to live out their dreams.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:31.343]  Powerful multinational corporations that exploit human populations all over the world to levels beyond any horror movie or H.P.
[01:00:31.383 --> 01:00:51.149]  Lovecraft novel are the very ones now setting up this tyranny in America and knowing that we care about race relations and knowing that we care and we have a basic Christian ethos still, they play on that and say, you're racist, you're bad, and when out of 350 million people something
[01:00:52.469 --> 01:01:02.073]  Sad happens to somebody at the hands of police officers like George Floyd, even if they're all charged, and even if they all go to prison, it doesn't matter.
[01:01:02.093 --> 01:01:04.594]  It's your fault because you're white.
[01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:18.060]  But it's white billionaires controlling things, saying that they want to divert from their crimes, their corruption, their illegal surveillance of the population on to
[01:01:19.693 --> 01:01:21.795]  Telling us that we're all individually bad?
[01:01:22.255 --> 01:01:35.805]  And now after three months of a lockdown and top scientists coming out and saying COVID-19 is a giant hoax designed to destroy the economy, now they move on to destroying the economy with looting and rioting and race war.
[01:01:35.965 --> 01:01:37.847]  It is absolutely evil.
[01:01:38.567 --> 01:01:40.849]  And now Senator Cotton of Arkansas has come out.
[01:01:42.711 --> 01:01:45.774]  And said that President Trump is absolutely right.
[01:01:45.854 --> 01:01:57.265]  We should invoke the Insurrection Act because all over the United States, more than 20 states run by blue governors and blue cities say riot, kill, attack.
[01:01:58.348 --> 01:02:01.710]  And will not call out the National Guard so the police are overwhelmed.
[01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:05.012]  This is an attempt to further stall the economy and bring down the country.
[01:02:05.392 --> 01:02:07.994]  And this will hurt the most disadvantaged Americans the most.
[01:02:08.294 --> 01:02:12.276]  And this is a diabolical crime that absolutely must be punished.
[01:02:12.856 --> 01:02:16.679]  The Justice Department has announced its opening criminal investigation of who's behind Antifa.
[01:02:17.179 --> 01:02:18.760]  Soros and Alexander Soros.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.701]  And these organizations, they fund like refusefascism.org.
[01:02:23.124 --> 01:02:25.225]  Who are the groups that run this?
[01:02:25.645 --> 01:02:27.345]  We have all the documents.
[01:02:27.745 --> 01:02:29.166]  We have all the proof.
[01:02:29.446 --> 01:02:30.926]  Friends of Democracy.
[01:02:31.707 --> 01:02:38.409]  These are the organizations that operated under Obama and the Clintons with impunity and are engaging in a massive criminal takeover.
[01:02:38.609 --> 01:02:44.931]  But we've got General Mattis and George W. Bush and all and George Will that said he didn't care about the primaries for Trump.
[01:02:44.951 --> 01:02:46.031]  That it should be overwritten.
[01:02:46.871 --> 01:02:48.872]  Because the plurality of the people didn't matter.
[01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:52.127]  These are monsters!
[01:02:52.527 --> 01:02:56.148]  And they're launching this attack on you and your rights and your freedom.
[01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:58.229]  And they're deadly dangerous.
[01:02:58.529 --> 01:02:59.710]  So see the chessboard.
[01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:02.091]  And see that they're using you as a pawn.
[01:03:02.831 --> 01:03:04.151]  And decide not to play their game.
[01:03:04.432 --> 01:03:06.292]  Expose the entire game.
[01:03:06.832 --> 01:03:07.713]  With the truth.
[01:03:08.313 --> 01:03:09.153]  With the justice.
[01:03:09.554 --> 01:03:10.214]  With freedom.
[01:03:11.434 --> 01:03:18.136]  Now, we're going to go to break, but I just want listeners to know and I want you to understand that without your support, we're not going to be here.
[01:03:18.636 --> 01:03:22.977]  And we are running a sale that absolutely will end on Sunday and then it's over.
[01:03:23.677 --> 01:03:26.778]  It is the Flash 60% off sale that I launched on Monday.
[01:03:27.238 --> 01:03:36.541]  It's the biggest sale, not just of this year, but arguably the biggest sale we've ever done because across the board, all of these amazing supplements
[01:03:37.461 --> 01:03:40.425]  Are 60% off right now.
[01:03:40.945 --> 01:03:53.380]  Supermail Vitality, Knockout Sleep Support, Brain Force, Biodry Selenium, Chill Force, Ultimate Krill Oil, Emerix Essentials, Hand Sanitizer, Organic Oils, DNA Force Plus, Living Defense Plus, Turbo Force.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:55.722]  Many of those we've never had at 60% off.
[01:03:57.324 --> 01:03:58.847]  That's how we fund this operation.
[01:03:59.067 --> 01:03:59.949]  They're great products.
[01:03:59.969 --> 01:04:01.271]  Get some t-shirts while you're at it.
[01:04:01.592 --> 01:04:07.021]  It's all there at infowarestore.com and that's how you fund the Second American Revolution and get high quality products.
[01:04:07.221 --> 01:04:09.025]  So thank you all for your support.
[01:04:09.145 --> 01:04:10.127]  Please take action now.
[01:04:13.618 --> 01:04:14.338]  All right, let me do this.
[01:04:14.398 --> 01:04:15.299]  I want to give the number out.
[01:04:15.379 --> 01:04:20.882]  I want to be judicious about this and actually go to 10 of your calls in the next two segments ahead of Otep Jesus joining us.
[01:04:21.102 --> 01:04:24.303]  A great activist, political thinker, and a great marketer.
[01:04:25.444 --> 01:04:28.546]  And so he'll be joining us coming up in the
[01:04:29.841 --> 01:04:35.124]  Third hour, I want to go directly to your calls on the issue of sending in federal troops.
[01:04:35.644 --> 01:04:36.965]  I'm Mr. Anti-Police State.
[01:04:37.425 --> 01:04:39.247]  Police existing is not a police state.
[01:04:39.747 --> 01:04:41.308]  Military existing is not a police state.
[01:04:41.648 --> 01:04:49.693]  A police state is when rule of law has broken down and you're under tyranny of the mob and then
[01:04:51.195 --> 01:05:02.223]  Either an oppressive tyrant comes in to restore order because they help create the crisis, usually, or someone comes in and tries to stop the disorder with temporary martial law.
[01:05:02.743 --> 01:05:03.604]  All of it's dangerous.
[01:05:03.764 --> 01:05:04.464]  All of it's bad.
[01:05:05.065 --> 01:05:08.087]  These type of powers that are seized upon normally don't get relinquished.
[01:05:09.363 --> 01:05:16.408]  That's why the globalists are putting us into martial law by having the lawlessness activated by the governors in the blue states, the blue cities.
[01:05:17.008 --> 01:05:25.915]  And so that way when Trump's removed by 25th Amendment or assassination or by a fake election, then the unrest never ends.
[01:05:27.176 --> 01:05:30.238]  And they trigger right-wing groups to go out and carry out events.
[01:05:31.519 --> 01:05:34.721]  They will then undoubtedly provocateur those false flags.
[01:05:35.521 --> 01:05:38.484]  You can see where all of this is going and we just go into a long
[01:05:39.488 --> 01:05:41.829]  Period of globalist reorganization of the country.
[01:05:42.149 --> 01:05:49.932]  But know this, the forces of the left hate American flags, they hate the military, they hate free market, they hate George Washington, they hate this country.
[01:05:50.712 --> 01:05:51.613]  That's their ethos.
[01:05:52.973 --> 01:05:55.234]  No borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[01:05:56.915 --> 01:06:03.337]  And so we have to tell ourselves, listen, the blue cities, the blue states, whole job is to collapse the country.
[01:06:04.998 --> 01:06:07.099]  So it can be reorganized, so it can be taken over.
[01:06:07.981 --> 01:06:09.303]  That's always been their plan.
[01:06:10.925 --> 01:06:12.647]  Soros has overthrown countless countries.
[01:06:13.148 --> 01:06:20.056]  And he works with the permanent deep state bureaucracy that has parlayed American power into global government and the new Chinese century.
[01:06:20.891 --> 01:06:21.831]  Of oppression and evil.
[01:06:22.571 --> 01:06:46.998]  So I oppose them fully conquering America through insurrection, and through overthrow of our government, because our government is the government of the people, for the people, by the people, with its long storied history, and the huge wars we fought to end slavery, and everything else that's happened, and I don't want to be conquered by the CHICOMS, and the bloodthirsty Big Tech, and the New World Order running our lives, and what they've done at the universities, and what they've done in our schools.
[01:06:49.002 --> 01:06:55.147]  And having the governors, you know, order the military to kneel in Los Angeles.
[01:06:55.167 --> 01:06:56.628]  This is a sign of slavery.
[01:06:57.809 --> 01:07:08.978]  James Woods is absolutely right that no matter what you think of the scene of them kneeling, they're supposed to be impartial and not kneeling to the leftist mob of Antifa meth-head trash.
[01:07:08.998 --> 01:07:10.439]  I mean, the M.O.
[01:07:10.459 --> 01:07:17.985]  on these people is they've been on welfare for 20 years, they've got two or three degrees, they sell drugs on the side, and they're white.
[01:07:18.968 --> 01:07:33.532]  And they've got chicken necks and all they do is run around trying to get black people to riot and we have all the internal documents and new videos coming out showing them and catching them on Infowars.com.
[01:07:34.092 --> 01:07:43.394]  New articles, new videos showing the Socialist Group of America and the rest of them financing this and running all of this and controlling all this because these people
[01:07:43.954 --> 01:07:55.278]  These academics, these communists, have been promised that they're going to live in mansions and run death camps and be in attack helicopters and be kicking Christians' guts in and raping your wife!
[01:07:55.818 --> 01:07:58.279]  You don't know the demonic filth of a commie!
[01:07:58.579 --> 01:08:00.580]  You've never been around it until you face them!
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:01.620]  They stink!
[01:08:02.281 --> 01:08:03.641]  They don't wipe their asses!
[01:08:04.061 --> 01:08:06.302]  They snort drugs all day!
[01:08:06.922 --> 01:08:08.083]  They're child molesters!
[01:08:09.056 --> 01:08:10.657]  They're an army of filth!
[01:08:11.417 --> 01:08:14.079]  And of course they're not going to be given any power once America falls.
[01:08:14.779 --> 01:08:17.641]  They'll be the ones actually put in the death camps first.
[01:08:18.742 --> 01:08:19.402]  We don't want that.
[01:08:20.042 --> 01:08:24.105]  We just want to defeat these maggots now and cut their money supply off.
[01:08:24.925 --> 01:08:27.367]  Alright folks, I'm going to give the number out and take your phone calls.
[01:08:27.387 --> 01:08:35.851]  800- numbers don't always work for folks that are outside of
[01:08:37.503 --> 01:08:39.104]  The United States, you can dial the U.S.
[01:08:39.164 --> 01:08:40.125]  country code and 512-646-1776.
[01:08:40.285 --> 01:08:40.885]  Country code 512-646-1776.
[01:08:40.965 --> 01:08:46.429]  If you're inside the United States or if 1-800 numbers work in your area around the world, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[01:08:46.469 --> 01:08:50.191]  Now, if you're tuning in today and you see here on the table, your TV viewer, a
[01:09:05.819 --> 01:09:12.725]  Medieval-style chess set from old, I guess, Norman period England.
[01:09:14.707 --> 01:09:18.851]  A real skull from a gentleman in India that died sometime in the 1960s.
[01:09:20.252 --> 01:09:21.574]  And some red roses.
[01:09:23.155 --> 01:09:24.696]  What does that symbolize?
[01:09:26.338 --> 01:09:28.140]  See, it's very, very esoteric.
[01:09:28.180 --> 01:09:29.321]  It's very, very Q-ish.
[01:09:30.282 --> 01:09:31.523]  It's very, very Gnostic.
[01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:34.085]  People like Gnostic things.
[01:09:34.105 --> 01:09:35.085]  They like hidden things.
[01:09:35.105 --> 01:09:46.688]  They don't want to just hear flat out, here's who runs Antifa, who's planning to overthrow the country, here are the criminals, here's how you stop them, here's who the embedded spies are for the globalists inside the government, here's the proof.
[01:09:47.748 --> 01:09:48.488]  People don't want that.
[01:09:49.248 --> 01:09:50.408]  They want esoterics.
[01:09:50.468 --> 01:09:51.668]  I'll give you esoteric today.
[01:09:53.469 --> 01:09:54.389]  But take Fiona Hill.
[01:09:56.089 --> 01:09:59.870]  Almost three years ago, Roger Stone and I sat in the studio right across the hall.
[01:10:00.902 --> 01:10:06.345]  And we outed Fiona Hill as a George Soros operative that ran his largest foundation.
[01:10:06.385 --> 01:10:08.407]  She was the number two person on the board of directors.
[01:10:08.767 --> 01:10:13.410]  And she wrote for a publication as a senior writer called TheGlobalist.com.
[01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:24.136]  So when we outed her, we were just like, what in the hell is Trump doing with this Fiona Hill who's doing all the major hiring for the State Department under McMaster?
[01:10:26.077 --> 01:10:30.220]  Then McMaster went in a dinner
[01:10:31.897 --> 01:10:37.140]  In New York, with billionaire funders of Trump, and said he's an idiot, we hate him, we're gonna overthrow him.
[01:10:40.182 --> 01:10:46.005]  And Fiona Hill's gotten all our people in, we're gonna set up a permanent dictatorship in America, screw the American people.
[01:10:46.685 --> 01:10:48.366]  They went and told Trump all that.
[01:10:50.668 --> 01:10:51.788]  Still, nothing was done.
[01:10:52.389 --> 01:10:53.890]  So Roger Stone went and met
[01:10:54.844 --> 01:10:55.344]  With Trump.
[01:10:55.424 --> 01:10:56.144]  I'll leave it at that.
[01:10:56.884 --> 01:11:09.607]  And so for committing the crime of going and exposing the coup against the President, I got 40-something lawsuits, he got a bunch of lawsuits, he got arrested, indicted, set up, you know the rest of the story.
[01:11:09.947 --> 01:11:14.788]  So I just want listeners and viewers to understand that you're not getting a bunch of esoteric stuff up here.
[01:11:16.128 --> 01:11:18.989]  Breadcrumbs and little piece of this, little piece of that.
[01:11:21.513 --> 01:11:25.774]  We're breaking down what's really going on on this planet.
[01:11:27.174 --> 01:11:28.635]  And I know it's a more fun riddle.
[01:11:29.075 --> 01:11:29.935]  What is the secret?
[01:11:29.995 --> 01:11:38.817]  Because I said, I talked to Q and Q said, this is the message for you, the skull and the chest pieces and the red roses.
[01:11:38.897 --> 01:11:41.338]  And there's one coin on the table.
[01:11:42.098 --> 01:11:43.978]  And what, what is on that coin?
[01:11:44.158 --> 01:11:47.139]  I guarantee you, even though I'm admitting that this is a,
[01:11:48.576 --> 01:11:51.438]  set piece to expose esoteric garbage.
[01:11:52.679 --> 01:11:54.080]  People are going to obsess over this.
[01:11:55.141 --> 01:11:56.362]  And I'm not against the Q people.
[01:11:57.723 --> 01:11:59.344]  We're meant to see patterns in things.
[01:11:59.464 --> 01:12:02.646]  We're meant to look for hidden images.
[01:12:02.747 --> 01:12:05.989]  We're meant to look at the rocks in the side of the cliff and see faces.
[01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:10.552]  Because you see patterns in the bushes and you see a pattern of a rabbit.
[01:12:10.652 --> 01:12:12.454]  Turns out it is a rabbit and you get to eat dinner.
[01:12:13.534 --> 01:12:15.516]  But sometimes it's not a rabbit in the bushes.
[01:12:16.577 --> 01:12:16.737]  It's a
[01:12:20.882 --> 01:12:23.424]  Dead rat or something, or it's a clump of leaves.
[01:12:24.364 --> 01:12:28.366]  So I'm not putting anybody down out there that likes to see esoteric images and things.
[01:12:30.248 --> 01:12:33.530]  All I'm doing is explaining that that's how that gets manipulated.
[01:12:38.613 --> 01:12:41.874]  And I think overall, people need to think about how things work.
[01:12:42.575 --> 01:12:44.556]  And people need to think about how things operate.
[01:12:44.836 --> 01:12:47.238]  You know, I've been getting a lot of calls lately by their talk show host.
[01:12:48.468 --> 01:13:01.953]  And people that are guests and they start telling me about, you know, Jones, do you know that there are data bridges and holes inside the NSA for thousands of contractors and foreign governments to get into the NSA and actually spy on us?
[01:13:02.193 --> 01:13:04.534]  Did you know it's designed for a global government takeover?
[01:13:05.014 --> 01:13:07.174]  And I'm like, yeah, we exposed that 20 years ago.
[01:13:07.235 --> 01:13:10.476]  And we've had William Benny on for over 10 years.
[01:13:10.576 --> 01:13:16.558]  And I'm not mad at people that they call me up and tell me that there's a new world order.
[01:13:17.768 --> 01:13:26.370]  I'm upset that they obviously weren't listening 10 years ago, or 20 years ago, and people just think, oh, it's just one more show.
[01:13:26.951 --> 01:13:29.571]  It's just one more place where somebody's up there talking.
[01:13:29.911 --> 01:13:33.032]  No, it's not just one more show, one more place.
[01:13:34.733 --> 01:13:38.074]  I mean, we don't really post my videos to InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com.
[01:13:39.144 --> 01:13:42.825]  Where I predicted all of this three years ago, five years ago, a year ago.
[01:13:43.185 --> 01:13:44.385]  We post breathlessly.
[01:13:44.905 --> 01:13:45.405]  Limbaugh!
[01:13:45.685 --> 01:13:56.607]  Limbaugh said there was a coup against the president and they were illegally spying on him to the FISA court and Obama ran and... And look, I'm glad we put Limbaugh up on the site.
[01:13:57.427 --> 01:13:59.408]  I don't want the credit Limbaugh gets.
[01:14:00.008 --> 01:14:00.608]  Breathlessly.
[01:14:02.648 --> 01:14:06.709]  It's just that it's bizarre that even in our own camp
[01:14:07.705 --> 01:14:13.530]  Even in our own office, we can't see the forest for the trees, or a prophet's not known in their own country.
[01:14:13.830 --> 01:14:20.095]  And I'm not saying I'm a prophet, I'm saying this whole organization, this whole movement, I have people calling me breathlessly.
[01:14:21.696 --> 01:14:36.368]  You know, the head of MI6 comes out and says, it's a man-made weapon, of course, and you've got the German government coming out saying it's fake, and the Italian government goes, hey, wait a minute, they're adding all the regular deaths for everything else in this, it looks like it's fake.
[01:14:37.150 --> 01:14:38.011]  Yes, it's fake!
[01:14:39.712 --> 01:14:42.754]  Then people say to me, well then why is it a bioweapon?
[01:14:43.074 --> 01:14:44.996]  Because they want the vaccine for it.
[01:14:45.696 --> 01:14:48.138]  And they finally want to have a vaccine that actually works.
[01:14:48.438 --> 01:15:01.868]  So they've got to isolate a chimera that even though it mutates is still basically the same virus so they can finally give you a vaccine and say they're saviors to set the precedent to take the future vaccines they're coming out with.
[01:15:03.854 --> 01:15:07.115]  And people ask, as it all comes out exactly like I said, how do I know this?
[01:15:07.215 --> 01:15:09.076]  Because all I do is study these people.
[01:15:09.416 --> 01:15:10.717]  All I do is read their documents.
[01:15:10.857 --> 01:15:13.038]  All I do is think about how they operate.
[01:15:13.078 --> 01:15:15.839]  And I know their style.
[01:15:16.219 --> 01:15:17.199]  I've got their number.
[01:15:17.459 --> 01:15:18.980]  I know the cut of their jib.
[01:15:20.240 --> 01:15:21.741]  I know what play they're gonna run.
[01:15:22.841 --> 01:15:24.182]  And I'm telling you folks,
[01:15:25.472 --> 01:15:31.857]  That everybody that thinks you can laugh at the left and laugh at all this and you think Trump's gonna win for sure, no, no, no.
[01:15:32.417 --> 01:15:36.080]  That right now Donald Trump's gonna lose the 2020 election.
[01:15:38.421 --> 01:15:42.524]  And that's a heavy subject to cover and to broker out to everybody here.
[01:15:43.365 --> 01:15:51.351]  Because I really want Trump to win, but if Trump doesn't make changes and if we don't make changes,
[01:15:52.358 --> 01:16:14.490]  And if they don't start really going after the deep state, the deep state has gotten away with every attempt, every shot they've taken at the election, and the American people, and at due process, and they have launched more and more escalations, and the next escalation is assassinating the president, or staging giant terror attacks, and blaming it on the right-wing patriots, and they're going to do it!
[01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:21.074]  And are we just going to sit here while the Clintons and the Obamas load up a fuel truck again and blow up a federal building?
[01:16:23.106 --> 01:16:33.171]  Are we just gonna sit here while they go and shoot up a black church with some mental patient they got wound up on psychotropics and amphetamines and amnesics in a hotel room right now?
[01:16:33.511 --> 01:16:37.133]  They got brainwashed Looney Tuners everywhere ready to go.
[01:16:37.393 --> 01:16:40.295]  They punch a couple buttons, it's over.
[01:16:41.015 --> 01:16:46.958]  There's no way to stop their false flags unless the leadership of the globalist is dealt with.
[01:16:48.115 --> 01:16:48.495]  I don't
[01:17:09.815 --> 01:17:12.357]  All right, we're going to your phone calls right now, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:17:12.377 --> 01:17:13.838]  Stories on Infowars.com.
[01:17:13.878 --> 01:17:17.401]  Riot death toll now higher than total deaths of unarmed black people in the whole of 2019.
[01:17:17.441 --> 01:17:23.045]  But don't worry, Big Bird and Elmo will address racism in virtual CNN Town Hall.
[01:17:40.572 --> 01:17:44.177]  NPR downplays rioters burning down African-American barbershop.
[01:17:46.059 --> 01:17:46.680]  They meant well.
[01:17:47.220 --> 01:17:55.270]  Fake-wokeness video game firm switches profile to LGBT flag, but not on the Middle Eastern accounts.
[01:17:56.592 --> 01:17:59.095]  It's all social engineering.
[01:18:05.114 --> 01:18:05.915]  I'm going to your phone calls.
[01:18:05.935 --> 01:18:07.215]  I want to make one key point here.
[01:18:07.235 --> 01:18:08.737]  I appreciate you calling in.
[01:18:08.757 --> 01:18:10.358]  Get Alex Jones here if you just tuned in.
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:17.082]  By the way, radio and TV stations want you to identify each time you come into a segment.
[01:18:17.102 --> 01:18:17.783]  That's why I have to do that.
[01:18:17.803 --> 01:18:18.884]  I don't like going, I'm Alex Jones!
[01:18:19.144 --> 01:18:19.504]  I'm Alex Jones!
[01:18:19.544 --> 01:18:20.605]  It's just something you have to do.
[01:18:22.128 --> 01:18:29.872]  Polly want a cracker, Polly want a cracker, but that's how the ratings work and it's how the stations are able to pay for their airtime and their station and what they do, so I understand it.
[01:18:30.192 --> 01:18:42.219]  But just a little side point for new viewers or listeners that may just be internet-centric and not really think back to the old days of radio and TV, which we're still on, thank God, because the censorship hasn't broken our back completely because of it and because of you spreading the word.
[01:18:43.620 --> 01:18:45.000]  But I digress severely.
[01:18:48.542 --> 01:18:49.703]  Paul Watson did a big video
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:19:00.182]  About the cult likeness of the anti-America demonstrators that are rioting all over the world against our country, attacking our embassies, you name it.
[01:19:01.823 --> 01:19:02.903]  By going, what are you doing?
[01:19:02.963 --> 01:19:04.263]  You could spread COVID.
[01:19:04.303 --> 01:19:05.324]  You're hypocrites.
[01:19:05.824 --> 01:19:11.905]  And look at the National Health Service and the NIH and all of it praising these people and coming out in your hazmat gear.
[01:19:13.426 --> 01:19:14.026]  It's all theater.
[01:19:14.046 --> 01:19:14.686]  It's all leftist.
[01:19:17.312 --> 01:19:18.313]  Don't even play into that.
[01:19:18.773 --> 01:19:24.956]  It's all fake to begin with, so of course they're now switching gears and aren't worried about all the demonstrators that are calling them heroes.
[01:19:25.557 --> 01:19:31.961]  It's all just leftists following their orders to try to bring society to a standstill.
[01:19:32.481 --> 01:19:39.165]  Alright, we got Juan, we got Johnny, we got Aaron, we got Justin, we got Carlos, we got Doug, we got Reed, we got Robert, we're going to everybody.
[01:19:40.742 --> 01:19:46.543]  You're on the air, Justin, from Virginia, where Governor Northam is trying to cause a civil war by removing the Robert E. Lee statue.
[01:19:46.723 --> 01:19:47.343]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:19:48.424 --> 01:19:48.644]  Yes.
[01:19:48.704 --> 01:19:56.225]  First of all, I want to say, Alex, a couple months ago, I really, I called in and really came down on you hard because of the whole Iran escalation.
[01:19:57.366 --> 01:20:01.346]  And, and then the stuff with Mike Adams really pushing fear with the virus.
[01:20:01.406 --> 01:20:08.628]  And then you, you had a complete turnaround and my God, you are America's hero right now.
[01:20:09.421 --> 01:20:16.005]  Um, you completely redeemed yourself to me, and I just want to say thank you, um, for calling out the fraud.
[01:20:16.626 --> 01:20:17.987]  Thank you for everything you're doing.
[01:20:18.727 --> 01:20:30.675]  And, um, what's going on in Virginia right now is that, um, I went to the protest where you were in Richmond about, um, the gun ban, and it was completely peaceful.
[01:20:30.915 --> 01:20:36.138]  They called us terrorists, they called us white supremacists, and we came in there with tens of thousands of people.
[01:20:37.492 --> 01:20:50.309]  During the quarantine now and during after the race war stuff, of all times for this governor to announce the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue, it's a landmark of Richmond.
[01:20:50.848 --> 01:20:52.068]  It is huge.
[01:20:52.088 --> 01:20:54.309]  It's going to take a massive amount of cranes.
[01:20:54.329 --> 01:20:57.150]  I don't even know if they can get cranes that could boot it.
[01:20:57.530 --> 01:21:04.573]  And again, this is designed to get a bunch of people that are for heritage and people that support Robert E. Lee, who's been loved in the North as well.
[01:21:04.973 --> 01:21:06.614]  One of the top generals in world history.
[01:21:07.114 --> 01:21:07.994]  Very respected.
[01:21:08.274 --> 01:21:09.995]  They know the dumbed-down leftists don't know that.
[01:21:10.535 --> 01:21:17.757]  And so again, they're like, oh, you know, the fact that Hillary's KKK or LBJ or Senator Byrne, that's okay, that their current KKK.
[01:21:18.177 --> 01:21:20.698]  Oh, but he was never in the KKK, but he's a bad guy.
[01:21:20.718 --> 01:21:24.419]  And this is just meant to cause an explosion, I believe.
[01:21:25.499 --> 01:21:25.739]  Yes.
[01:21:25.939 --> 01:21:32.901]  And they know that Virginians and patriots are going to go there and they're going to protest this.
[01:21:33.401 --> 01:21:36.102]  And they know that there's going to be Black Lives Matters and Antifa there.
[01:21:37.904 --> 01:21:41.105]  I think he was meant for this little program the whole time.
[01:21:41.465 --> 01:21:44.126]  Why did he survive all this controversy?
[01:21:44.206 --> 01:21:46.827]  Probably because he was going to be the hitman for this job the whole time.
[01:21:47.447 --> 01:21:50.909]  And I just want to tell you what I've done personally.
[01:21:51.129 --> 01:21:52.829]  I've never owned an AR-15.
[01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:55.530]  I've always wanted to pay my bills on time.
[01:21:55.570 --> 01:21:56.311]  You go to money.
[01:21:56.711 --> 01:21:57.531]  I said hell with it.
[01:21:58.011 --> 01:21:59.912]  I went and bought an AR-15 on Monday.
[01:22:00.012 --> 01:22:01.032]  I put it on a credit card.
[01:22:01.332 --> 01:22:02.273]  Who cares about the debt?
[01:22:02.593 --> 01:22:04.954]  If you have a credit card with enough money to get an AR-15,
[01:22:05.922 --> 01:22:07.443]  Go put it on the credit card right now.
[01:22:07.463 --> 01:22:08.624]  The money's fake anyways.
[01:22:08.644 --> 01:22:09.744]  You might as well buy something else.
[01:22:09.764 --> 01:22:10.465]  Well, here's the deal.
[01:22:10.605 --> 01:22:11.706]  He says it's imminent.
[01:22:11.786 --> 01:22:14.347]  He wants to cause riots.
[01:22:14.687 --> 01:22:16.248]  I believe they'll have provocateurs there.
[01:22:16.288 --> 01:22:19.751]  They were so pissed about how they wanted to cause race riots the last one.
[01:22:19.791 --> 01:22:21.051]  It totally freaked them out with what?
[01:22:21.091 --> 01:22:24.614]  Probably 25% of the marchers were black.
[01:22:25.134 --> 01:22:26.675]  A ton of folks were Hispanic and Asian.
[01:22:27.055 --> 01:22:29.417]  It freaked the living snot out of the New World Order.
[01:22:29.457 --> 01:22:29.897]  God bless you.
[01:22:29.917 --> 01:22:30.577]  I appreciate your call.
[01:22:30.938 --> 01:22:34.520]  Yeah, this Governor Northam situation is big.
[01:22:35.745 --> 01:22:38.507]  By the way, people misunderstood what I was saying about the coronavirus.
[01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:39.747]  We knew it was man-made.
[01:22:39.827 --> 01:22:41.028]  We knew Bill Gates was involved.
[01:22:42.509 --> 01:22:43.730]  We knew it was coming out of Wuhan.
[01:22:44.290 --> 01:22:49.173]  We didn't know how deadly it was, but we knew it was a big move and a forced inoculation.
[01:22:50.034 --> 01:22:52.775]  And so I knew it was going to be big here before it got here.
[01:22:53.316 --> 01:22:58.038]  Then once we saw it was a permanent lockdown, and as more intel came out, we figured out what was going on.
[01:22:58.739 --> 01:22:59.960]  So that's where I stand on that.
[01:23:01.140 --> 01:23:01.761]  But I remember your call.
[01:23:01.781 --> 01:23:03.582]  I think you misunderstood what I was getting at, sir.
[01:23:06.124 --> 01:23:09.307]  Now Gates just said, oh this is just a drill, he told Colbert.
[01:23:09.587 --> 01:23:10.428]  This is just a test.
[01:23:10.488 --> 01:23:13.610]  The big one's coming when terrorists release a bioweapon.
[01:23:13.630 --> 01:23:14.431]  It's going to be much worse.
[01:23:14.831 --> 01:23:17.294]  He's telling you what he's going to do, in my view.
[01:23:17.854 --> 01:23:19.675]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[01:23:19.696 --> 01:23:20.136]  You're on the air.
[01:23:20.156 --> 01:23:20.676]  Thanks for holding.
[01:23:22.298 --> 01:23:22.558]  Hey, hello.
[01:23:22.578 --> 01:23:23.279]  Can you hear me?
[01:23:23.519 --> 01:23:24.159]  I sure can, sir.
[01:23:24.179 --> 01:23:24.520]  Thank you.
[01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:25.961]  Hey, Alex.
[01:23:26.281 --> 01:23:32.827]  Before I start, man, I just... I've been wanting to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to...
[01:23:34.059 --> 01:23:35.740]  To be talking right now here, man.
[01:23:36.020 --> 01:23:37.381]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[01:23:39.083 --> 01:23:44.346]  I'm calling from New Brent, Connecticut, and... I just want to plug in.
[01:23:44.847 --> 01:23:53.112]  I'm a truck driver, and two before us have changed... Have changed, you know, the way I drive.
[01:23:54.013 --> 01:23:56.275]  Me and my brothers that drive.
[01:23:57.015 --> 01:23:58.276]  There's a couple of us.
[01:23:58.316 --> 01:24:02.319]  We're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[01:24:04.461 --> 01:24:09.264]  And one of my friends that's Cuban, he was the one that got me into 2x4s.
[01:24:09.284 --> 01:24:25.434]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank you for that man.
[01:24:25.950 --> 01:24:31.354]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder there is.
[01:24:31.834 --> 01:24:34.096]  So this was designed by one of the top guys in the country.
[01:24:34.116 --> 01:24:36.878]  He didn't want his name on it because, obviously, the political issues.
[01:24:36.918 --> 01:24:40.020]  But we had to pay a lot of money for this formulation just for the design of it.
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:44.784]  And we believe it is the best, strongest, but healthiest energy out there.
[01:24:44.924 --> 01:24:47.166]  And you're saying that it's made your life better?
[01:24:47.186 --> 01:24:47.866]  So that means a lot to me.
[01:24:47.906 --> 01:24:48.226]  Thank you.
[01:24:49.828 --> 01:24:51.629]  And I want you to know, Jerry Alexander,
[01:24:53.163 --> 01:24:56.704]  It's a big Hispanic group that got your back, that got the president's back.
[01:24:58.264 --> 01:25:00.505]  All my buddies, we're all Puerto Rican.
[01:25:00.785 --> 01:25:09.267]  There's a bunch of Cubans that we drive and we listen to you guys, Owen and David, and we're big fans of you guys.
[01:25:09.507 --> 01:25:10.828]  Well, brother, I'm a fan of you.
[01:25:10.888 --> 01:25:12.288]  We're all in this together.
[01:25:12.328 --> 01:25:14.489]  This is all anti-human garbage and we love you.
[01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:15.689]  We appreciate you.
[01:25:15.729 --> 01:25:16.789]  What's on your mind, Juan?
[01:25:18.990 --> 01:25:22.371]  Well, since you know I'm out in Connecticut, so there's nothing but liberals over here.
[01:25:23.203 --> 01:25:50.218]  And, um, last Saturday they made a process in downtown Britain, and, um, man, I passed by on my car, and I got a big drumstick in the back of my car, and I thought it was gonna start throwing stuff in my car, and I saw all of them kneeling, and I was like, this is crazy, man, what I'm looking over here about.
[01:25:51.445 --> 01:25:57.209]  What do you make of the military kneeling to a bunch of mainly white communist students in Los Angeles?
[01:25:57.229 --> 01:25:58.170]  I mean, this is not good.
[01:25:59.811 --> 01:26:00.551]  It's not good at all.
[01:26:00.591 --> 01:26:07.136]  I mean, I got I got family in Puerto Rico, Alex, that they're falling for this, man.
[01:26:08.037 --> 01:26:10.698]  In Puerto Rico right now, they're falling for it.
[01:26:11.379 --> 01:26:13.580]  They're starting to burn the American flag.
[01:26:14.581 --> 01:26:20.045]  And I guarantee you, Alex, that all those Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico that are doing that, they're all getting
[01:26:21.425 --> 01:26:22.306]  United States help.
[01:26:23.947 --> 01:26:27.930]  What's insane is, if you live in America and love America, you are America.
[01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:33.693]  Why, if one cop does something wrong, do we burn up the embassies and burn the country down?
[01:26:33.733 --> 01:26:34.554]  It's just stupid!
[01:26:36.235 --> 01:26:46.802]  And it's so upset when I see that they're trying to do the same thing in Puerto Rico, when Puerto Rico has gotten nothing but help when they need it the most.
[01:26:47.503 --> 01:26:48.864]  Everybody say, oh, Trump,
[01:26:51.262 --> 01:26:54.423]  My father was in Puerto Rico when the hurricane passed by Maria.
[01:26:55.443 --> 01:26:59.904]  And the first thing that my father told me is, one, don't worry about us.
[01:27:00.004 --> 01:27:00.984]  We're fine over here.
[01:27:01.805 --> 01:27:03.865]  There's nothing but helicopters in the sky.
[01:27:04.745 --> 01:27:08.946]  And he would say, well, it was Air Force, you know, they got help.
[01:27:09.506 --> 01:27:13.387]  All these things that are saying that they never got help, they did got their help.
[01:27:14.155 --> 01:27:14.515]  That's right.
[01:27:14.535 --> 01:27:16.196]  The communist Chinese don't help anybody.
[01:27:16.216 --> 01:27:17.696]  They just exploit and enslave.
[01:27:17.976 --> 01:27:20.877]  And America's not perfect, but compared to a lot of other countries, we're a great nation.
[01:27:21.357 --> 01:27:24.598]  And the people that want us to hate each other and kill each other want to conquer us.
[01:27:24.959 --> 01:27:26.959]  Juan, great points to all your truck drivers.
[01:27:26.999 --> 01:27:27.479]  We love you.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:28.420]  Everybody.
[01:27:28.600 --> 01:27:31.741]  I don't care if you're old, young, brown, white, black, whatever.
[01:27:32.201 --> 01:27:33.041]  We love freedom.
[01:27:33.061 --> 01:27:33.822]  We love justice.
[01:27:33.862 --> 01:27:34.842]  America's not perfect.
[01:27:35.609 --> 01:27:40.431]  That we know an evil force is coming in here to take over and we're going to stand up against it together.
[01:27:40.451 --> 01:27:41.691]  All right, we're going to come back.
[01:27:41.711 --> 01:27:48.894]  We're going to go to Carlos and Aaron and Reed and everybody else and then Hotep Jesus, always informative, always on fire.
[01:27:48.914 --> 01:27:50.114]  He'll join us as well.
[01:27:50.994 --> 01:27:51.475]  Stay with us.
[01:27:51.515 --> 01:27:52.475]  Third hour straight ahead.
[01:27:54.956 --> 01:27:59.117]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:27:59.857 --> 01:28:01.278]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:28:06.837 --> 01:28:07.197]  The U.S.
[01:28:07.237 --> 01:28:11.999]  military kneeling in front of communists and liberal idiots.
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:17.941]  This is being ordered by the governors and by their commanding officers and others.
[01:28:17.981 --> 01:28:20.882]  This is disgusting.
[01:28:22.462 --> 01:28:28.164]  And you've got some of the folks are wearing brown beret uniforms.
[01:28:29.005 --> 01:28:31.565]  That's a Hispanic supremacist organization.
[01:28:33.246 --> 01:28:35.687]  And others are wearing other little commie outfits and uniforms.
[01:28:38.703 --> 01:28:40.985]  I saw people wearing Mao Youth Brigade uniforms.
[01:28:41.005 --> 01:28:42.647]  This is just beyond ridiculous.
[01:28:44.288 --> 01:28:47.131]  The left are just the scum of the earth.
[01:28:48.151 --> 01:28:55.958]  And they've got the NFL bowing and everyone else bowing and Drew Brees came out and said, I don't like bowing, you know, kneeling during the anthem.
[01:28:55.998 --> 01:28:57.460]  It's disrespectful of my grandfathers.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:28:59.482]  And now he says he's sorry.
[01:28:59.502 --> 01:29:03.085]  Oh, I mean, just because he's afraid of losing money.
[01:29:06.357 --> 01:29:07.798]  I wonder what his grandfathers would think of him.
[01:29:08.459 --> 01:29:10.901]  Well, my grandfathers are proud of me, Drew Brees.
[01:29:11.441 --> 01:29:12.922]  I'm not gonna bow to this new world order.
[01:29:13.242 --> 01:29:14.103]  You're disgusting.
[01:29:15.204 --> 01:29:17.906]  You know, it's worse that he came out and did the right thing and then backed off.
[01:29:18.307 --> 01:29:20.608]  It's a new religion, hating that you're white.
[01:29:21.009 --> 01:29:22.230]  What the hell?
[01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:23.110]  Craziness.
[01:29:23.130 --> 01:29:26.393]  This is as nutty as Jim Jones, man.
[01:29:27.114 --> 01:29:28.034]  Where's the Kool-Aid?
[01:29:29.796 --> 01:29:30.917]  Hand out the Kool-Aid!
[01:29:32.057 --> 01:29:33.739]  Carlos in Canada, what do you think's going on?
[01:29:36.101 --> 01:29:45.004]  I think, Alex, underlying the fact that there's an Antifa movement, which is obviously being paid for by you-know-who.
[01:29:46.184 --> 01:29:57.107]  I'm not interested in that as much as the problem which underlies it, and that is that ordinary people went out to demonstrate sincerely against police brutality.
[01:29:57.660 --> 01:30:03.661]  And that is something that is reflected in large measure when the police show some generosity towards the people.
[01:30:03.941 --> 01:30:06.142]  They answer with hugs and so on to the police.
[01:30:06.442 --> 01:30:12.183]  The people of America love the police because they know that they're their safety and security against crime.
[01:30:12.623 --> 01:30:24.146]  However, when the police abuse them unnecessarily, traffic, you know, stopping identity checks and so on, these individuals, normal Americans who are proud people,
[01:30:24.674 --> 01:30:28.415]  I feel very much obliged by the American Police Department.
[01:30:28.896 --> 01:30:35.818]  And I want to tell you, the state of Minnesota, where Floyd was killed, trained its police officers in 2012 in Israel.
[01:30:36.238 --> 01:30:50.403]  And they've been sending states like Florida, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Arizona, Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Georgia, and Washington State, as well as Washington, D.C., go to Israel for training.
[01:30:50.843 --> 01:30:52.624]  And when they come back, they come back
[01:30:53.763 --> 01:30:55.224]  Like, everybody's a Palestinian.
[01:30:55.504 --> 01:31:00.765]  You know, that's the great point is that the Israelis use a lot of paramilitary policing that we don't.
[01:31:01.125 --> 01:31:07.007]  The LAPD in like 1990 got rid of these chokeholds because it killed people and I didn't know that Minnesota was doing that.
[01:31:07.047 --> 01:31:12.689]  I knew a lot of cities and counties are getting paramilitary Israeli training and I think that is not smart.
[01:31:13.570 --> 01:31:16.270]  No, it's not smart at all because you look at the policemen from before 2012
[01:31:18.902 --> 01:31:21.364]  And now, and they're dressed like they're out to kill.
[01:31:21.644 --> 01:31:25.806]  I mean, these people, they look like robots in disguise, okay?
[01:31:26.006 --> 01:31:29.208]  And what are we actually doing?
[01:31:29.668 --> 01:31:31.489]  I mean, the American people deserve better.
[01:31:32.970 --> 01:31:37.632]  American people have been around for a long time and they have training from European police departments.
[01:31:37.832 --> 01:31:41.114]  They don't need to go to some country that has just started doing this.
[01:31:41.576 --> 01:31:49.402]  And I'll tell you something, it's part of a large program which I called, for lack of a better word, the Israelization of America.
[01:31:49.943 --> 01:32:02.053]  And it started very innocently with people wearing the blue flag of the flag of Israel, like on a daily color, and mimicking Mr. Netanyahu, who did that regularly.
[01:32:02.413 --> 01:32:07.257]  And after that, I said, my God, why is everybody wearing this blue Israeli flag color?
[01:32:07.697 --> 01:32:08.558]  Well, there is certainly no doubt.
[01:32:23.959 --> 01:32:27.762]  I don't care who you are, Russian, Chinese or Israeli, they need to stay out of U.S.
[01:32:27.782 --> 01:32:29.284]  politics and I hear what you're saying.
[01:32:29.304 --> 01:32:30.685]  Thanks for the call, Carlos.
[01:32:47.794 --> 01:32:51.718]  All right, I'm really excited to have Hotep Jesus with us for the balance of the hour.
[01:32:52.599 --> 01:32:54.341]  HotepNation.com.
[01:32:54.801 --> 01:32:55.822]  He is a thought leader.
[01:32:55.842 --> 01:33:01.928]  He's cultivated a loyal following on social media and being honest and genuine while providing knowledge and experience and pulling a lot of great stunts.
[01:33:03.610 --> 01:33:05.812]  Starbucks saying, give me reparations, and people doing it.
[01:33:06.112 --> 01:33:12.597]  Ho-Tep Jesus is a tech startup founder, author, and has been marketing for close to two decades in both the traditional and digital spheres.
[01:33:12.637 --> 01:33:16.760]  And I wanted to get him on just about what's going on here, because I'm on a virtue signaler, folks.
[01:33:17.060 --> 01:33:23.305]  I don't go, oh, half the black people get aborted, or, oh, Planned Parenthood's racist, or, oh, oh.
[01:33:23.745 --> 01:33:26.568]  I mean, that's the reality, folks, and it's targeting everybody.
[01:33:27.188 --> 01:33:29.169]  But it's been beta tested in the black community.
[01:33:29.709 --> 01:33:35.032]  And Bill Gates says he loves Africans, and then you got the headline, he's worried about African population and wants to reduce it.
[01:33:35.052 --> 01:33:38.354]  But it's like, I don't want you to live, but I love black lives.
[01:33:38.434 --> 01:33:44.377]  And you're like, oh, you gave me money to Black Lives Matter to run around and virtue signal, but you actually don't want me to exist.
[01:33:45.057 --> 01:33:46.698]  That's the reality of this.
[01:33:47.845 --> 01:33:49.547]  And Malcolm X talked about it.
[01:33:49.567 --> 01:33:51.209]  Anybody that studies it has looked at it.
[01:33:51.689 --> 01:33:55.614]  And my bottom line is, if you let anything happen to any group, it's going to happen to you.
[01:33:55.954 --> 01:33:56.795]  But look at this footage.
[01:33:56.835 --> 01:33:58.056]  It's on Infowars.com.
[01:33:58.617 --> 01:34:04.703]  Swedish policewoman takes a knee, cries after protesters attack her vehicle.
[01:34:05.044 --> 01:34:06.485]  Look at the Stockholm Syndrome.
[01:34:06.726 --> 01:34:08.928]  Yeah, it comes from Sweden for a reason.
[01:34:09.168 --> 01:34:09.589]  Here it is.
[01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:24.258]  Okay, so there you go.
[01:34:24.278 --> 01:34:26.099]  Now let's go ahead and show
[01:34:51.837 --> 01:34:54.419]  The National Guard kneeling to a bunch of white communists.
[01:34:54.459 --> 01:34:54.859]  Here it is.
[01:34:54.879 --> 01:34:55.840]  This is in Los Angeles.
[01:34:59.122 --> 01:35:00.623]  Pics are hot.
[01:35:09.417 --> 01:35:10.637]  This isn't going to create unity.
[01:35:10.657 --> 01:35:16.840]  This is just going to expand what's going on in the universities, the mind control, and the big tech censorship to everywhere now.
[01:35:17.140 --> 01:35:19.001]  You must all now bow to this.
[01:35:19.661 --> 01:35:21.401]  And the social credit score, you'll be punished.
[01:35:21.742 --> 01:35:24.583]  Hotep Jesus, thank you so much for joining us, hotepnation.com.
[01:35:25.263 --> 01:35:26.403]  A lot of folks know who you are.
[01:35:26.503 --> 01:35:28.324]  Some might not, just tuning in.
[01:35:28.624 --> 01:35:33.346]  Tell us a little bit about who you are, and then what do you want to dive into first about what's currently going on?
[01:35:34.912 --> 01:35:38.653]  Well, first of all, thank you for having me on Alex Jones and Info Wars.
[01:35:39.133 --> 01:35:44.835]  One of the few media outlets to reach out to me, actually the only media outlet to reach out to me.
[01:35:45.055 --> 01:35:48.035]  So let's just put that in frame first.
[01:35:49.916 --> 01:36:01.979]  The first thing I want to talk about is, talking to my girl earlier, and she said a friend was asking friends to match her donation to Black Lives Matter.
[01:36:03.208 --> 01:36:12.034]  And I told her, I said, tell her every dollar she sends to Black Lives Matter is going to go towards the destruction of the black family.
[01:36:13.715 --> 01:36:21.201]  If white people want to help in this country, there's only one group I know of that we can trust, in fact, and that is HOTEP Nation.
[01:36:21.721 --> 01:36:31.828]  Black Lives Matter is definitely a white liberal controlled and black liberal steered agenda vehicle.
[01:36:33.086 --> 01:36:34.367]  That's what Black Lives Matter is.
[01:36:35.387 --> 01:36:39.150]  So, you know, let's just, let's put that in frame first.
[01:36:40.811 --> 01:36:49.496]  Now, we also have to separate Black Lives Matter from the organization and the movement, so to speak, if it even is one.
[01:36:50.517 --> 01:36:58.782]  Because a lot of people try to use this hashtag in various ways to fit the needs of their personal agenda.
[01:37:00.834 --> 01:37:13.424]  Some people are using this hashtag and they mean well, but I believe that the hashtag has been used to weaponize a socialist ideology against black people.
[01:37:15.986 --> 01:37:21.510]  Well, we know how socialism does for everybody, but it's particularly not good for my just observance of for black people.
[01:37:23.852 --> 01:37:26.074]  Socialism is inherently racist.
[01:37:26.134 --> 01:37:27.135]  I spoke about this earlier.
[01:37:28.564 --> 01:37:30.666]  Actually, yesterday I spoke about this on my Periscope.
[01:37:31.986 --> 01:37:33.147]  Socialists are inherently racist.
[01:37:33.467 --> 01:37:34.328]  Socialists, what do they want?
[01:37:34.348 --> 01:37:35.549]  They always want to increase taxes.
[01:37:35.569 --> 01:37:36.949]  Well, the rich can't afford taxes.
[01:37:36.989 --> 01:37:37.690]  The poor can't.
[01:37:37.770 --> 01:37:44.974]  And if black people are allegedly the poorest in the nation, then obviously you're oppressing them with your socialist policies.
[01:37:45.775 --> 01:37:47.295]  So, socialism is inherently racist.
[01:37:47.315 --> 01:37:49.777]  We don't want nothing to do with socialism or communism.
[01:37:49.797 --> 01:37:50.998]  This is how you destroy nations.
[01:37:51.018 --> 01:37:54.740]  This is how they destabilize Venezuela and other nations.
[01:37:55.632 --> 01:37:59.095]  Because socialism and communism basically is decentralization of power.
[01:38:00.996 --> 01:38:06.080]  As Stalin would say, 90% of communizing a nation is having a central bank.
[01:38:07.121 --> 01:38:18.570]  So when you think about socialism and communism, if you say America is run by white supremacy or is a system of white supremacy, the last thing you would want to do is centralize the power.
[01:38:19.971 --> 01:38:20.451]  Keep going.
[01:38:22.833 --> 01:38:25.175]  That's the last thing you want to do is
[01:38:26.943 --> 01:38:31.346]  If you say there's a system of white supremacy, why would you want to centralize the power?
[01:38:31.386 --> 01:38:35.509]  That's what socialism and communism would do, would centralize the power and give you no power.
[01:38:36.069 --> 01:38:47.037]  But people don't understand, for example, George Orwell was a former member of the Fabian Society, and the Fabian Society, when you look at their shield, you'll see a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[01:38:47.057 --> 01:38:52.581]  So when you see democratic socialists, socialists, and communists, what you're looking at is a wolf in sheep's clothing.
[01:38:52.901 --> 01:38:56.043]  He'll pretend like he's your ally, waiting.
[01:38:56.849 --> 01:38:59.430]  He'll post that black box on his Instagram page.
[01:39:00.210 --> 01:39:01.371]  He may even take a knee.
[01:39:02.211 --> 01:39:06.693]  But that's the same exact person that gets close enough to stab you in the back.
[01:39:09.234 --> 01:39:09.694]  That's right.
[01:39:09.714 --> 01:39:12.975]  In fact, he found out that Fabian Social's at the top because he got at the very highest levels.
[01:39:13.436 --> 01:39:16.697]  Literally said, we're priests of power that want to tear people apart.
[01:39:17.157 --> 01:39:18.178]  We like to hurt people.
[01:39:18.218 --> 01:39:19.558]  This is just a cult of power.
[01:39:21.839 --> 01:39:22.379]  There it go.
[01:39:23.720 --> 01:39:24.140]  There it go.
[01:39:25.197 --> 01:39:45.490]  So, when people say, oh, you know, 1984, oh, George Orwell was a socialist, yeah, you need to go look at what he did to expose socialism as an ideology and as an organization, as a front movement for civil rights, so to speak, if we want to call it that.
[01:39:48.692 --> 01:39:49.333]  The kneeling
[01:39:51.195 --> 01:39:52.576]  I think is disgusting?
[01:39:53.237 --> 01:39:55.098]  I don't want to speak on behalf of white people.
[01:39:55.138 --> 01:39:56.859]  I don't, you know, we're not going to talk about that yet.
[01:39:57.019 --> 01:39:58.140]  Let's talk about black people.
[01:39:59.641 --> 01:40:04.104]  Black people are actually happy that white people are taking this knee.
[01:40:04.144 --> 01:40:09.628]  These are like moral victories, and as Jay-Z would say, moral victories are for minor league coaches.
[01:40:10.969 --> 01:40:15.512]  These little moral victories don't do anything to prop up the black community.
[01:40:16.113 --> 01:40:16.393]  They're
[01:40:17.239 --> 01:40:24.402]  Actually only helping white people who are racist, who are democrat, socialist, racist, hide their racism.
[01:40:24.862 --> 01:40:29.624]  That's all it's doing is allowing them to cloak their racism.
[01:40:30.145 --> 01:40:34.026]  Here we see the National Guard kneeling before people.
[01:40:34.667 --> 01:40:35.247]  That's cute.
[01:40:35.887 --> 01:40:36.467]  That's cute.
[01:40:37.508 --> 01:40:40.169]  Has nothing to do with the military industrial complex.
[01:40:41.317 --> 01:40:44.759]  That's not going to change how much money goes towards the military budget.
[01:40:44.899 --> 01:40:48.921]  I was about to say an alligator or crocodile will come up kneeling in the mud right before it eats you.
[01:40:49.201 --> 01:40:57.085]  And I'm not saying the military is bad, but I'm saying the thing behind it is like a crocodile and it'll get up on its back, it'll come up, it'll bow down to you.
[01:40:59.566 --> 01:41:01.107]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:41:02.368 --> 01:41:07.110]  We know of many assassinations that were pulled off by getting close to someone.
[01:41:07.648 --> 01:41:11.909]  And that's what we have here is the assassination of the black community via Saturn's black box.
[01:41:13.369 --> 01:41:14.870]  It's a way for people to virtue signal.
[01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:21.031]  People are, many, many, I'm not going to say all, many people are attending these protests.
[01:41:21.951 --> 01:41:22.191]  Why?
[01:41:22.211 --> 01:41:25.332]  So they can feel like they were a part of something.
[01:41:25.392 --> 01:41:31.393]  They take the pictures, the Instagram, they get their feel good in, they do their dancing, they do their chanting.
[01:41:32.418 --> 01:41:33.119]  It's the new party.
[01:41:33.139 --> 01:41:35.881]  A couple of weeks ago, government said we had a social distance.
[01:41:36.301 --> 01:41:37.782]  What happened to that, Alex?
[01:41:38.983 --> 01:41:40.304]  What happened to social distancing?
[01:41:40.344 --> 01:41:46.789]  They just told us, they just told us we had a social distance, but it looks like riots killed coronavirus.
[01:41:47.714 --> 01:41:48.854]  You tell me what happened, Alex.
[01:41:49.895 --> 01:41:56.937]  Well, that hoax started falling apart, so they didn't want the debate to be about how all these top scientists and governments were coming out saying it was all basically a big lie.
[01:41:57.257 --> 01:42:01.618]  So they went ahead and activated the next phase, always knowing there's some bad cop footage.
[01:42:01.919 --> 01:42:12.322]  They then hyped that up, triggered the whole thing, had it primed and ready to distract from the fact that they're going to come back in the fall and next year with the mask and the lockdowns again, because we never had the point of debate.
[01:42:12.762 --> 01:42:14.883]  To discredit this, they moved on to the next thing.
[01:42:15.343 --> 01:42:16.983]  So they tighten the noose, release the noose.
[01:42:17.023 --> 01:42:18.244]  Tighten the noose, release the noose.
[01:42:18.584 --> 01:42:20.484]  Until they finally jerk it tight and break our neck.
[01:42:20.765 --> 01:42:21.845]  Hotep Jesus is our guest.
[01:42:22.125 --> 01:42:23.485]  HotepNation.com.
[01:42:23.925 --> 01:42:24.766]  Really powerful stuff.
[01:42:24.786 --> 01:42:26.706]  I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com.
[01:42:27.747 --> 01:42:29.507]  Please tell folks about the broadcast.
[01:42:29.527 --> 01:42:30.107]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:31.368 --> 01:42:32.288]  There's an equation.
[01:42:32.988 --> 01:42:38.150]  A societal, cultural, spiritual, mathematical calculation.
[01:42:40.455 --> 01:42:56.764]  A balance somehow to where the collapsing third world engineered by the very globalist colonial system that now claims it's battling the ancient colonial imperial system.
[01:42:58.825 --> 01:43:07.350]  Collapsing the third world, weaponizing it as a weapon against the West, promoting racism and division, then knowing it'll bust the public into two sides.
[01:43:08.496 --> 01:43:20.604]  for further confrontation as the machines and the oppression and the anti-human system emerges as people are driven off the land as we're domesticated and prepared for the post-human world.
[01:43:20.624 --> 01:43:36.434]  I want to ask Hotep Jesus his view on the cosmology of the planet where he sees the world really going and how we can somehow turn this around have a better outcome but separately continuing getting into what's currently happening and Governor Northam obviously
[01:43:37.557 --> 01:43:41.619]  He wants to take down a Robert E. Lee statue, the big giant one, to cause a big explosion.
[01:43:41.859 --> 01:43:48.042]  Regardless of what people think about that one way or the other, nobody pays attention to that stuff now until there's a big clash.
[01:43:48.443 --> 01:43:49.923]  They're trying this for the election.
[01:43:50.704 --> 01:43:51.744]  I don't think that's debatable.
[01:43:51.764 --> 01:43:53.685]  What do you think and what do you think is going to end up happening?
[01:43:54.926 --> 01:43:56.447]  Men lie, women lie, numbers dope.
[01:43:56.927 --> 01:43:57.987]  Another Jay-Z quote.
[01:43:58.488 --> 01:44:05.291]  When we look at the numbers, if we go to Google Trends and we type in Black Lives Matter and we check Google Trends, you'll see two major spikes.
[01:44:06.151 --> 01:44:07.092]  You'll see one this year,
[01:44:07.972 --> 01:44:08.773]  Just happening now.
[01:44:09.614 --> 01:44:13.637]  And the last major spike was during the last election year.
[01:44:15.159 --> 01:44:16.160]  So you start to see trends.
[01:44:17.621 --> 01:44:19.763]  And where you have trends, you have cycles.
[01:44:20.444 --> 01:44:22.105]  Where you have cycles, you have conditioning.
[01:44:22.145 --> 01:44:25.448]  We can go look at the work of Pavlov, or Pavlonian conditioning.
[01:44:26.349 --> 01:44:31.254]  Pavlonian conditioning, what happens is, the meat makes the dog salivate.
[01:44:33.379 --> 01:44:33.779]  Beautiful.
[01:44:33.999 --> 01:44:34.340]  I love it.
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:35.360]  Brought it to Google Trends.
[01:44:35.440 --> 01:44:37.802]  As you can see right there, you'll see the two different spikes.
[01:44:38.882 --> 01:44:42.885]  When you feed the dog the meat, he starts to salivate on the side of the meat.
[01:44:43.005 --> 01:44:44.926]  If you ring a bell, nothing happens.
[01:44:45.927 --> 01:44:52.491]  But if you ring a bell every single time you're about to feed him the meat, soon, if you ring the bell, the dog will salivate.
[01:44:53.712 --> 01:44:54.872]  This is what we call conditioning.
[01:44:56.053 --> 01:45:02.217]  In this case, when we're dealing with the human condition, or human conditioning, what we have is
[01:45:03.149 --> 01:45:08.931]  The bell is the media and the meat, well, the meat is attention.
[01:45:10.732 --> 01:45:27.019]  The dopamine hits we get when we post our fist picture on Instagram, when we splice together our video clips and make little promo videos for Instagram and Twitter and YouTube to make it look like we were a part of history.
[01:45:29.201 --> 01:45:33.404]  When the media says move, or when the media says bark, people say woof.
[01:45:35.265 --> 01:45:37.826]  When the media say jump, the people say how high.
[01:45:38.967 --> 01:45:40.368]  The media is now Pavlov.
[01:45:40.928 --> 01:45:47.032]  Not just a Pavlov, but they are conditioning the people to respond a certain way.
[01:45:47.112 --> 01:45:50.674]  And you see the same response time in, time out.
[01:45:51.300 --> 01:45:58.084]  The Saturn's black box appeared last time, four years ago, when they wanted to do another blackout, something called Blackout Day.
[01:45:58.284 --> 01:46:00.245]  This time it was Blackout Tuesday.
[01:46:00.985 --> 01:46:08.649]  But really what happened was they wanted to put a blackout on Hillary Clinton not wanting to testify in the oath.
[01:46:09.170 --> 01:46:11.671]  Now, Alex, I know you're on top of this thing.
[01:46:12.351 --> 01:46:15.433]  I haven't been able to look at it too in-depth.
[01:46:16.453 --> 01:46:19.095]  Can you please tell me what exactly is happening?
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:21.301]  With Hillary Clinton in court.
[01:46:21.361 --> 01:46:23.464]  I know something happened with Rosenstein yesterday.
[01:46:23.764 --> 01:46:24.245]  Absolutely.
[01:46:24.485 --> 01:46:35.937]  All of the facts about her servers and her corruption and her documents and her having to testify and the silent coup against Trump and the deep state and just this whole apparatus is now
[01:46:36.838 --> 01:46:37.238]  Coming out.
[01:46:37.298 --> 01:46:38.338]  In fact, here it is right here.
[01:46:38.818 --> 01:46:39.599]  It was just announced.
[01:46:39.679 --> 01:46:46.740]  Senate Homeland Security Committee authorizes subpoena to Obama officials in Russian probe unmasking review.
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:50.801]  So all of this attempted coup against the election is coming out.
[01:46:50.821 --> 01:46:52.042]  There's a war in the deep state.
[01:46:52.462 --> 01:46:53.742]  And so that's why this is going on.
[01:46:53.762 --> 01:46:54.942]  But what you just said is genius.
[01:46:55.562 --> 01:46:56.743]  And it's totally true.
[01:46:57.663 --> 01:47:02.264]  They admit, but the way you put it was absolutely the best I've heard it put, is Pavlov's dog.
[01:47:03.534 --> 01:47:09.258]  We're giving up everything just for clicks and dopamine, like an imaginary video game, when we win the level.
[01:47:09.278 --> 01:47:10.399]  We don't really win anything.
[01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:12.621]  It's all just hype in our mind.
[01:47:12.701 --> 01:47:13.761]  Perception is reality.
[01:47:13.962 --> 01:47:15.443]  But it's not really reality.
[01:47:15.783 --> 01:47:18.625]  And so it's all, it's all hot air.
[01:47:18.665 --> 01:47:20.186]  It's all just BS.
[01:47:20.306 --> 01:47:23.208]  And that's all this is, is virtue signaling.
[01:47:23.248 --> 01:47:25.830]  But to these people, this is all they are.
[01:47:25.850 --> 01:47:27.171]  Instead of getting the steak,
[01:47:27.771 --> 01:47:31.653]  We hear the ding, we salivate, and our brain thinks it's the same thing.
[01:47:31.693 --> 01:47:32.214]  It's incredible.
[01:47:32.394 --> 01:47:38.597]  But then they're never satisfied, so they want more, more, more, more, more dopamine, because in the end, it can never actually put stake in our guts.
[01:47:39.638 --> 01:47:39.898]  Yeah.
[01:47:40.158 --> 01:47:44.741]  So you have somebody like Hillary Clinton and the Obama administration who are abusing their power.
[01:47:47.102 --> 01:47:49.584]  And we're mad at Drew Brees, an NFL football player.
[01:47:51.866 --> 01:47:55.210]  Nobody, you know, I would say the same thing I would say to LeBron James.
[01:47:55.250 --> 01:47:57.172]  I'd tell LeBron James, shut up and dribble.
[01:47:57.232 --> 01:47:59.695]  And I'd tell Drew Brees, shut up and throw the ball.
[01:47:59.735 --> 01:48:03.499]  I don't know why these people are important, why we care about what these people say.
[01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:13.370]  But again, this is the distraction to take us away from what's really happening with this thing called the deep state.
[01:48:14.853 --> 01:48:18.616]  Now, I believe that a date has been set for September?
[01:48:18.936 --> 01:48:19.176]  Yes.
[01:48:19.897 --> 01:48:20.558]  What's that date?
[01:48:20.778 --> 01:48:21.278]  September 9th?
[01:48:21.318 --> 01:48:22.739]  Let me look it up.
[01:48:22.779 --> 01:48:23.420]  I believe you're right.
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:24.641]  On the Hillary ones?
[01:48:26.382 --> 01:48:27.303]  Yeah, it's in September.
[01:48:29.044 --> 01:48:30.025]  Yeah.
[01:48:30.205 --> 01:48:33.348]  So, I want to say that's a significant date.
[01:48:33.388 --> 01:48:35.229]  We're going to have to... Oh, absolutely.
[01:48:35.249 --> 01:48:39.893]  They're going to have some new big riot or some new federal building get blown up or a mass shooting.
[01:48:39.913 --> 01:48:41.834]  Guys, look up where they put the Hillary date.
[01:48:42.114 --> 01:48:42.375]  Please?
[01:48:42.415 --> 01:48:42.615]  Thanks.
[01:48:43.692 --> 01:48:44.612]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:48:45.272 --> 01:48:45.892]  Look at this.
[01:48:46.112 --> 01:48:48.213]  I think something else happened around this date.
[01:48:48.513 --> 01:48:49.233]  Oh, wait.
[01:48:49.873 --> 01:48:52.334]  September 11th.
[01:48:52.914 --> 01:48:58.535]  Do you see how they put that date right under something that allowed them to disguise things?
[01:48:58.775 --> 01:48:59.235]  Exactly.
[01:48:59.755 --> 01:49:02.615]  Well, just like they admit that they'll release bad news on Friday night.
[01:49:04.256 --> 01:49:06.836]  Right, right, right, right.
[01:49:06.856 --> 01:49:08.076]  Well, nobody's going to think about it.
[01:49:08.416 --> 01:49:10.297]  And that's what the blackout Tuesday was.
[01:49:10.337 --> 01:49:11.777]  They wanted a blackout
[01:49:12.581 --> 01:49:16.083]  On everything that's going to happen with the Deep State.
[01:49:16.843 --> 01:49:18.284]  And how patronizing is that?
[01:49:18.304 --> 01:49:27.689]  Because, I mean, literally the left always claiming they love black people so much, but every time I've ever been around leftists, whether they be black or white, they literally talk bad about black people.
[01:49:27.729 --> 01:49:29.350]  And I'm not just saying this to be... I mean, I'm serious.
[01:49:29.390 --> 01:49:29.890]  I've been around them.
[01:49:29.910 --> 01:49:37.094]  I've caught the videos where we'll be out protesting a Planned Parenthood and saying, you know, the KKK, Margaret Sanger, picture her with the KKK.
[01:49:37.514 --> 01:49:39.275]  And the left comes over and screams at us and says,
[01:49:39.915 --> 01:49:42.376]  You're going to take care of all these dangerous black kids?
[01:49:43.397 --> 01:49:45.538]  So it's really systemic with them.
[01:49:46.798 --> 01:49:47.279]  Oh, yeah.
[01:49:47.299 --> 01:49:49.340]  You see it in Joe Biden's rhetoric.
[01:49:49.380 --> 01:49:52.101]  You're not black if you vote for Trump.
[01:49:53.281 --> 01:50:04.347]  So, like I said before, the white liberal subconsciously and consciously knows for a fact that they are the arbiter of blackness.
[01:50:05.609 --> 01:50:09.553]  They know that they control blackness and Biden slipped up.
[01:50:09.653 --> 01:50:11.334]  He had a Freudian slip.
[01:50:11.374 --> 01:50:13.656]  He's saying, I have your, I have your identity.
[01:50:14.497 --> 01:50:15.118]  It's incredible.
[01:50:16.359 --> 01:50:16.619]  Yes.
[01:50:16.859 --> 01:50:17.119]  Yes.
[01:50:17.740 --> 01:50:22.925]  He had another slip up where he said, um, poor kids can be just as smart as white kids.
[01:50:24.006 --> 01:50:31.252]  He's exposed that racism that he has that we see in the Delaware, the democratic state of Delaware.
[01:50:31.653 --> 01:50:31.713]  Ooh.
[01:50:34.408 --> 01:50:35.749]  I know folks that know Joe Biden.
[01:50:35.769 --> 01:50:43.940]  I know somebody that grew up next to his bar and his brother, a well-known lawyer, and he said, he won't say it on air, but he said, Joe Biden hates everybody.
[01:50:44.641 --> 01:50:47.805]  I mean, Joe Biden is a super jerk, a criminal.
[01:50:48.806 --> 01:50:50.266]  A tote won't pay his bills.
[01:50:50.687 --> 01:50:52.547]  I mean, the guy is just a total a-hole.
[01:50:52.867 --> 01:50:54.028]  Just like Hillary doesn't tip.
[01:50:54.548 --> 01:50:56.348]  I mean, Hillary screams everybody around her.
[01:50:56.628 --> 01:51:00.069]  We'll be right back with Hotep Jesus, ladies and gentlemen, hotepnation.com.
[01:51:00.370 --> 01:51:04.391]  We've got some of the greatest Exploits 2 videos we're going to play of his, and a lot more.
[01:51:04.411 --> 01:51:05.711]  And I know we've got callers that are holding.
[01:51:05.751 --> 01:51:06.911]  I'm going to try to jam a few of you in.
[01:51:07.192 --> 01:51:08.852]  Hotep will be able to comment on whatever it is you're bringing up.
[01:51:09.152 --> 01:51:10.953]  Whatever you do, spread the word about the live feeds.
[01:51:10.973 --> 01:51:11.813]  It's the only way it gets out.
[01:51:12.898 --> 01:51:19.920]  There are powerful corporations that want a one-world government system, and they want medical tyranny, and they want to force their way on you.
[01:51:20.821 --> 01:51:31.984]  And the fact that they're dividing and conquering us, telling us that the average white person or black person is our enemy because of what skin color they are, is absolutely the stuff of planetary slavery.
[01:51:32.505 --> 01:51:38.126]  Here's Hotep Jesus a few years ago illustrating how crazy white guilt is going in to a Starbucks.
[01:51:38.146 --> 01:51:38.947]  This is pretty famous.
[01:51:38.987 --> 01:51:39.327]  Here it is.
[01:51:40.851 --> 01:51:41.251]  How you doing?
[01:51:41.472 --> 01:51:42.012]  Good, how are you?
[01:51:42.232 --> 01:51:46.436]  Alright, I heard y'all was racist, so I came to get my own free coffee.
[01:51:46.936 --> 01:51:47.457]  I saw that.
[01:51:47.977 --> 01:51:53.622]  Yeah, I heard you guys don't like black people, so I wanted to get my Starbucks reparations voucher.
[01:51:54.863 --> 01:51:55.203]  What's that?
[01:51:55.303 --> 01:51:56.024]  Is that a real thing?
[01:51:56.404 --> 01:51:57.125]  It's a real thing.
[01:51:57.145 --> 01:51:58.546]  I mean, I'll give it to you.
[01:51:58.646 --> 01:52:00.388]  I saw that on my Twitter last night.
[01:52:00.448 --> 01:52:02.910]  I was like... Yeah, I need a free coffee.
[01:52:02.930 --> 01:52:04.732]  I'll give you a free coffee.
[01:52:04.772 --> 01:52:05.853]  That's what I'm talking about.
[01:52:06.213 --> 01:52:06.954]  This is justice.
[01:52:10.137 --> 01:52:19.344]  This is justice.
[01:52:19.364 --> 01:52:20.364]  This is what I'm talking about.
[01:52:22.786 --> 01:52:24.007]  It's great customer service.
[01:52:25.688 --> 01:52:30.151]  Yeah, I was reading that and I was like, there is no way.
[01:52:30.271 --> 01:52:30.832]  Absolutely.
[01:52:32.613 --> 01:52:33.714]  I like this part.
[01:52:33.754 --> 01:52:34.954]  He goes, I need some of this.
[01:52:36.115 --> 01:52:36.896]  Could you imagine?
[01:52:38.468 --> 01:52:41.950]  You should throw some milk in it.
[01:52:41.970 --> 01:52:43.391]  Sure.
[01:52:43.451 --> 01:52:44.092]  What kind of milk?
[01:52:44.732 --> 01:52:45.673]  Uh, whole.
[01:52:48.455 --> 01:52:48.695]  Yeah.
[01:52:49.516 --> 01:52:50.516]  Reparations, man.
[01:52:51.497 --> 01:52:53.959]  Gotta get my reparations for being black in America.
[01:52:54.279 --> 01:52:55.179]  Black Lives Matter.
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:58.161]  Do you have any flavors in it?
[01:52:58.201 --> 01:52:59.602]  We got caramel, hazelnut.
[01:52:59.682 --> 01:53:00.363]  I'll take caramel.
[01:53:00.383 --> 01:53:02.084]  Caramel shorts.
[01:53:03.025 --> 01:53:03.945]  Is that gonna make it sweet?
[01:53:03.965 --> 01:53:05.686]  Uh, do you want one of two?
[01:53:05.967 --> 01:53:06.187]  Yes.
[01:53:07.654 --> 01:53:08.394]  All right, that's good.
[01:53:08.474 --> 01:53:09.074]  Everybody's seen it.
[01:53:09.094 --> 01:53:09.595]  It's famous.
[01:53:10.895 --> 01:53:13.596]  But this then makes logical people freak out.
[01:53:13.656 --> 01:53:17.117]  But then we sent our crew member in who's white, and he said, give it to me for reparations, and they did it.
[01:53:17.617 --> 01:53:24.839]  I wore a lizard mask into the store the other day, into Target, just to show how stupid it is, because they'll say any mask will do.
[01:53:25.199 --> 01:53:26.179]  They try to make you wear them.
[01:53:27.831 --> 01:53:29.552]  And people just submitted to it.
[01:53:29.592 --> 01:53:31.792]  I ran around saying, I lay my eggs here, you name it.
[01:53:32.072 --> 01:53:33.253]  People are so passive now.
[01:53:33.293 --> 01:53:33.953]  It's really scary.
[01:53:33.973 --> 01:53:40.395]  And Jotep, that's one of the things you wanted to get into was Soros, the vaccine, Antifa, Bill Gates.
[01:53:40.455 --> 01:53:43.356]  You now have the former head of MI6 coming out saying it was made in a lab.
[01:53:43.936 --> 01:53:48.818]  You've got German official government document, Interior Ministry, looked at it, said it's the same amount of deaths.
[01:53:50.311 --> 01:53:53.352]  We've got global experts, even CNBC now says, say it just doesn't exist.
[01:53:53.732 --> 01:53:57.113]  But there's a real virus, it's patented so Gates can own it and make money off of it.
[01:53:57.553 --> 01:54:01.634]  And the imaginary treatment of it, I mean, this is the biggest con ever in my view.
[01:54:01.654 --> 01:54:03.014]  What do you think's going on here, Otep?
[01:54:05.855 --> 01:54:10.316]  Yeah, so people don't know who Sobros is.
[01:54:10.516 --> 01:54:18.858]  And I think they need to do a good look into who he is and his work in foreign countries.
[01:54:19.648 --> 01:54:21.429]  And how he came into his riches.
[01:54:22.529 --> 01:54:25.890]  How this man understands and manipulates markets.
[01:54:26.610 --> 01:54:32.672]  Then we have to take a look at and audit all the organizations that Open Society funds.
[01:54:33.452 --> 01:54:34.653]  Women's organizations.
[01:54:35.273 --> 01:54:38.894]  They fund Planned Parenthood and Black Lives Matter.
[01:54:39.794 --> 01:54:47.977]  Two institutions that profit or profiteer off of black struggle or black problems.
[01:54:48.692 --> 01:54:50.213]  These two organizations get paid off.
[01:54:50.693 --> 01:54:53.033]  We know last week what happened.
[01:54:53.374 --> 01:54:57.755]  Planned Parenthood was, some people were forced to testify under oath.
[01:54:58.515 --> 01:55:01.176]  Come to find out they were in fact selling baby parts.
[01:55:03.517 --> 01:55:08.038]  These people are selling dead babies.
[01:55:08.138 --> 01:55:10.579]  If that's not satanic, I don't know what is.
[01:55:11.399 --> 01:55:16.941]  And these are the people that prop up these protests.
[01:55:17.648 --> 01:55:24.494]  When we see these protests happen like that, you gotta know Soros is lurking somewhere in the shadows.
[01:55:24.654 --> 01:55:25.454]  You have to.
[01:55:25.775 --> 01:55:31.059]  Because to organize that many people globally and that fast, oh, is quite difficult.
[01:55:31.860 --> 01:55:45.531]  But when you donate to close to a hundred non-profit organizations and movements, like Planned Parenthood and women's organizations, and FACT,
[01:55:46.528 --> 01:55:47.609]  I retweeted it earlier.
[01:55:47.629 --> 01:55:48.409]  There's a list of them.
[01:55:48.909 --> 01:55:57.173]  There's a list of organizations that are right on my Twitter feed that are funded by Soros and Open Society.
[01:55:57.913 --> 01:56:09.358]  So when I say that black people are literally controlled by the white liberal or the white socialist or the white communist or whatever they cloak themselves under, this is true.
[01:56:09.778 --> 01:56:15.201]  Not only that, but the same people also fund Antifa.
[01:56:16.943 --> 01:56:18.624]  Antifa is also funded.
[01:56:18.864 --> 01:56:21.966]  The RAG Media Matters is funded by these people.
[01:56:22.626 --> 01:56:24.487]  The Shadow Democratic Party.
[01:56:24.567 --> 01:56:27.148]  What is a Shadow Democratic Party?
[01:56:27.469 --> 01:56:31.231]  The Democratic Party is funded by Open Soil Roads.
[01:56:32.551 --> 01:56:39.595]  So we have people who, for example, a lot of people with the riots this past weekend,
[01:56:40.518 --> 01:56:42.379]  We know governors have come out and said that.
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:47.823]  One governor said in Minneapolis, I believe, 95% of the people that were arrested were from out of town.
[01:56:48.743 --> 01:56:50.745]  Soros and his band of goons of Antifa.
[01:56:51.565 --> 01:56:58.170]  And you got people that donate to some bailout fund to bail out protesters.
[01:56:58.870 --> 01:57:03.113]  So basically what you're doing is you're bailing out the criminals who destroyed the black community.
[01:57:03.133 --> 01:57:09.237]  This is what happens when you're ill-informed, when you're not up to date.
[01:57:10.373 --> 01:57:11.915]  On the information that's available.
[01:57:12.296 --> 01:57:23.171]  When you cover your eyes and cover your ears at the sight and sound of Alex Jones or the name of Donald Trump, you are blinding yourself to some facts.
[01:57:24.212 --> 01:57:24.493]  You see,
[01:57:25.419 --> 01:57:33.362]  If you're looking at the Republican Party with a microscope, you also have to look at the Democratic Party with a microscope.
[01:57:34.042 --> 01:57:44.145]  And I believe that many conservatives have done a great job exposing the Democratic Party, but it seems like when people see those things, they go, oh, it's associated with Trump, so I don't want to hear it.
[01:57:44.405 --> 01:57:45.786]  They don't want to deal with the facts.
[01:57:46.446 --> 01:57:52.568]  But facts say Antifa, Black Lives Matter, Planned Parenthood are all funded by the same white liberal.
[01:57:53.354 --> 01:57:57.116]  None of these organizations are independent of George Soros.
[01:57:57.617 --> 01:57:59.658]  And when the police captain in St.
[01:57:59.698 --> 01:58:10.784]  Louis got killed, David Dorn, nobody even covered it as he laid there dying and none of the Hollywood people gave any money to him or for his funeral or his family because he didn't count.
[01:58:11.565 --> 01:58:15.427]  In fact, for all the people that have been killed, the Hollywood folks aren't doing a damn thing.
[01:58:16.528 --> 01:58:17.989]  You can't monetize his death.
[01:58:18.689 --> 01:58:20.590]  You cannot monetize his death.
[01:58:21.231 --> 01:58:21.711]  You have
[01:58:22.341 --> 01:58:24.164]  First of all, you got a double Trump card.
[01:58:24.384 --> 01:58:27.169]  He's a, he's black, but he's a cop.
[01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:31.761]  So you definitely can't monetize that.
[01:58:32.241 --> 01:58:33.841]  You definitely can't monetize that.
[01:58:33.901 --> 01:58:38.502]  And a lot of the left teaches black people, oh, don't have your own police and fire department and run your own community.
[01:58:38.782 --> 01:58:39.862]  Those people are sellouts.
[01:58:39.962 --> 01:58:44.063]  No, that's how you make sure you run the local constabulary so you're in charge.
[01:58:44.303 --> 01:58:46.283]  But again, they teach you, oh, no, don't be part of the system.
[01:58:46.623 --> 01:58:48.404]  You just stay right there and take your welfare check.
[01:58:48.604 --> 01:58:51.404]  That is so obviously just a modern form of slavery.
[01:58:51.424 --> 01:58:52.244]  It's so cynical.
[01:58:53.585 --> 01:58:54.965]  Yeah, I think the institution
[01:58:56.028 --> 01:59:04.253]  Of policing is inherently communist, but to pass judgment upon individuals that are on the police force is wholly unfair.
[01:59:04.533 --> 01:59:07.535]  I know police officers, black police officers.
[01:59:08.295 --> 01:59:13.458]  This one black police officer saved my life at least twice.
[01:59:14.299 --> 01:59:21.043]  At least twice, because his mother went to the same church as my grandmother, and he knew me from a very little boy.
[01:59:22.142 --> 01:59:24.183]  I know several police officers.
[01:59:24.523 --> 01:59:24.823]  R.I.P.
[01:59:24.843 --> 01:59:25.903]  to my best friend's dad.
[01:59:26.003 --> 01:59:27.184]  He was a police officer.
[01:59:27.244 --> 01:59:29.625]  He was a great police officer here in New Jersey.
[01:59:30.965 --> 01:59:31.265]  Exactly.
[01:59:31.285 --> 01:59:35.787]  The system inherently has problems and is corrupt, but you don't judge people by the whole system.
[01:59:35.807 --> 01:59:38.168]  You judge them by individualism, which is common sense.
[01:59:39.128 --> 01:59:45.030]  Yes, this is common sense, but when you're controlled by Pavlov's conditioning,
[01:59:46.081 --> 01:59:48.202]  You gotta throw, you know, like Lil Wayne said.
[01:59:48.242 --> 02:00:03.146]  He said you cannot look at these police incidents and just say all cops are bad because what happens is the police officer that was implicated in the murder of Tamir Rice and all these other bodies, none of them have been incarcerated.
[02:00:03.166 --> 02:00:04.627]  Sean King has done a poor job.
[02:00:04.647 --> 02:00:05.787]  He's like 0 and 5.
[02:00:06.247 --> 02:00:06.907]  He's 0 and 5.
[02:00:06.947 --> 02:00:08.268]  These cops are still on the force.
[02:00:08.548 --> 02:00:08.748]  Why?
[02:00:08.808 --> 02:00:12.789]  Because you try to make this about all cops instead of the individual cops
[02:00:13.502 --> 02:00:16.365]  That made these infractions, that murdered somebody.
[02:00:17.626 --> 02:00:18.307]  Because why?
[02:00:19.235 --> 02:00:25.519]  That's the only way the media and their band of useful idiots can monetize this stuff and gain clout tokens.
[02:00:26.119 --> 02:00:33.764]  That's a really good point, is that's how you stop real reform happening, is you just make it about, oh, all cops did this, well then all cops go, I didn't do that, instead of like this one guy.
[02:00:33.784 --> 02:00:35.825]  I mean, there are doctors that cut off the wrong leg.
[02:00:35.845 --> 02:00:36.766]  You don't blame all doctors.
[02:00:37.086 --> 02:00:39.087]  Obviously, what those cops did in Minnesota is crazy.
[02:00:39.427 --> 02:00:45.371]  I want to ask you what you really think is going on there, because there's something suspicious how they all know each other, and that cop's got to know what he's doing.
[02:00:45.931 --> 02:00:47.012]  Something doesn't add up.
[02:00:47.132 --> 02:00:48.073]  I haven't figured it out yet.
[02:00:48.113 --> 02:00:49.775]  We'll see if Hotep Jesus has got an answer.
[02:00:50.135 --> 02:00:51.056]  And your calls are coming up too.
[02:00:51.076 --> 02:00:53.979]  All right, final segment with Hotep Jesus.
[02:00:53.999 --> 02:00:54.980]  Really appreciate him joining us.
[02:00:55.000 --> 02:01:02.948]  We're going to go to Greg, Johnny, Aaron, Duncan, Frank, Reed, and Justin before Jason Jones takes over with a special guest.
[02:01:03.308 --> 02:01:04.029]  But look at this.
[02:01:04.830 --> 02:01:05.750]  We showed this earlier.
[02:01:06.491 --> 02:01:07.012]  Privilege!
[02:01:07.092 --> 02:01:08.293]  This is going viral everywhere.
[02:01:08.853 --> 02:01:09.894]  Black Lives Matter.
[02:01:11.038 --> 02:01:16.422]  Like, saying you're teaching someone that you're a kid because of what color they are is somehow privileged or bad?
[02:01:16.622 --> 02:01:17.623]  It's insane!
[02:01:18.604 --> 02:01:21.585]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the stuff of the breakdown of society.
[02:01:22.226 --> 02:01:26.768]  Because they're taking all of our rights, all of our freedoms, all of our health, coming with forced inoculations.
[02:01:26.788 --> 02:01:27.668]  They're coming after everybody.
[02:01:27.988 --> 02:01:37.553]  So they want to teach you, though, that, oh, it's not G.G.Ping and the three million Muslims in slave camps that's bad, because I don't like radical Islam taking over folks, but I sure don't want to put Muslims in camps.
[02:01:38.073 --> 02:01:41.134]  Oh, but that's okay, because, you know, they're communists, so it's okay.
[02:01:41.434 --> 02:01:42.195]  This is totally
[02:01:43.468 --> 02:01:44.629]  It is not enough!
[02:02:12.230 --> 02:02:17.474]  For America's future, that some participate and others don't.
[02:02:18.354 --> 02:02:21.396]  We have been given an extraordinary blessing.
[02:02:22.317 --> 02:02:26.440]  And at this moment in time, our country needs us.
[02:02:27.380 --> 02:02:36.647]  And we need people like George Soros, who is fearless and willing to step up when it counts.
[02:02:37.007 --> 02:02:39.789]  So please join me in welcoming George Soros.
[02:02:41.261 --> 02:02:43.763]  I mean, you talk about the Nazi folks, that's as close as you're going to get.
[02:02:47.265 --> 02:02:48.286]  And he funds the whole thing.
[02:02:49.406 --> 02:03:02.895]  It is the first time that I feel that I need to stand up and do something really, and become really engaged.
[02:03:03.424 --> 02:03:04.445]  Let's talk about the children.
[02:03:04.485 --> 02:03:09.350]  I saw a clip of a little black girl at the protest and she got her fist up and she looks angry and upset.
[02:03:26.517 --> 02:03:32.861]  And then we see that picture of that little white girl, and I think that's embarrassing that we're doing this.
[02:03:32.901 --> 02:03:38.625]  First of all, the antics that have been going across America this week, I haven't even told my children about.
[02:03:38.685 --> 02:03:44.669]  I don't think... I want to tell them because I think it's quite embarrassing as adults that we have to sit here and we have to watch adults act like this.
[02:03:45.210 --> 02:03:45.770]  You just said it.
[02:03:46.070 --> 02:03:46.811]  They're pawns.
[02:03:46.911 --> 02:03:51.034]  Even if this was a real fight, you don't bring kids to a battle, and that's what people are doing.
[02:03:51.374 --> 02:03:52.755]  People are exploiting their children.
[02:03:53.752 --> 02:03:54.514]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:03:54.814 --> 02:03:57.700]  Leave the kids out of this nonsense.
[02:03:58.479 --> 02:04:03.503]  They need to be working on STEM or, you know, hitting the books or doing some art.
[02:04:03.583 --> 02:04:04.183]  Something else.
[02:04:04.503 --> 02:04:05.924]  Something that's going to educate them.
[02:04:06.945 --> 02:04:12.989]  My 12-year-old daughter asked me yesterday morning, because I try to keep her out of all the right stuff, she said, are white people bad?
[02:04:13.049 --> 02:04:14.630]  I mean, are we bad?
[02:04:14.650 --> 02:04:16.672]  And I said, honey, that's a total lie.
[02:04:16.932 --> 02:04:18.033]  That's all politics.
[02:04:18.673 --> 02:04:20.074]  She goes, but are we doing bad things?
[02:04:20.114 --> 02:04:21.856]  And I said, have you done something bad to somebody?
[02:04:22.416 --> 02:04:22.876]  And she goes, no.
[02:04:23.096 --> 02:04:24.798]  And I said, well, see, it's about who you are.
[02:04:25.798 --> 02:04:27.820]  But trying to explain it makes me get really pissed.
[02:04:29.008 --> 02:04:29.848]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:04:30.089 --> 02:04:34.210]  What would you say to my 12-year-old daughter asking, is she bad because she's white?
[02:04:36.472 --> 02:04:43.135]  I would tell her, I would have to explain to her the media industrial complex.
[02:04:43.395 --> 02:04:44.075]  That's what I would do.
[02:04:44.135 --> 02:04:50.078]  I would break down the media industrial complex and how it can make people believe all sorts of silly things.
[02:04:50.258 --> 02:04:51.859]  And then I'd tell her, no sweetie,
[02:04:53.245 --> 02:04:54.987]  You are an individual.
[02:04:55.067 --> 02:04:56.648]  You are not described by others.
[02:04:56.788 --> 02:04:59.390]  You are described by your actions and how you live in this world.
[02:05:01.212 --> 02:05:02.533]  That's what I would tell her, in short.
[02:05:03.951 --> 02:05:06.252]  Well, I hate to go back to Martin Luther King every five minutes, but it's true.
[02:05:06.632 --> 02:05:10.373]  The whole idea is you judge people off who they are, which we all know.
[02:05:10.433 --> 02:05:17.155]  You judge somebody off their music, how good it is, how good the food is, how much fun they are, how funny they are, how good of plants they can grow.
[02:05:17.175 --> 02:05:28.618]  I mean, everybody knows you judge people off what they actually do, so then how is the left pushing this truly anti-human, fascist, satanic ideology and thinking they're the good guys?
[02:05:28.638 --> 02:05:33.120]  I mean, because I want to really slap these leftists upside the head when I see them bringing their kids to these demonstrations.
[02:05:33.993 --> 02:05:44.357]  If we were to be objective about the treatment of black people across the globe, I think white people would come last.
[02:05:46.038 --> 02:05:50.679]  We can look at ethnic cleansing in Argentina.
[02:05:51.320 --> 02:05:53.620]  We can look at ethnic cleansing in Brazil.
[02:05:53.761 --> 02:05:57.562]  We can look at ethnic cleansing in the Arab world.
[02:05:58.866 --> 02:06:04.434]  I'd much rather be a black person under white rule than a black person under Arab rule.
[02:06:05.315 --> 02:06:06.036]  Ten times over.
[02:06:07.878 --> 02:06:08.920]  Under Chinese rule!
[02:06:09.260 --> 02:06:11.002]  We look at how Chinese... It's still 1950.
[02:06:11.643 --> 02:06:13.686]  You have some places that say this is Chinese only.
[02:06:13.706 --> 02:06:15.889]  This is Chinese only.
[02:06:16.437 --> 02:06:17.798]  Some people say, ah, white people.
[02:06:17.838 --> 02:06:19.779]  I'm like, ah, you don't really understand this whole world.
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.681]  You're giving white people a little bit too much credit.
[02:06:21.841 --> 02:06:23.382]  And is that because Americans don't travel enough?
[02:06:23.402 --> 02:06:24.142]  Because we take Japan.
[02:06:24.162 --> 02:06:25.243]  I don't think it's the Japanese either.
[02:06:25.263 --> 02:06:29.646]  They still, because they hate Chinese so much, have restaurants that say no Chinese allowed.
[02:06:30.827 --> 02:06:34.590]  You got some dogs that are conditioned and some dogs that are unconditioned.
[02:06:34.650 --> 02:06:37.872]  Some dogs have been conditioned by Pavlov's conditioning.
[02:06:38.232 --> 02:06:40.334]  And some people haven't been exposed to the experiment.
[02:06:40.394 --> 02:06:42.455]  HOTEPs, we haven't been exposed to the experiment.
[02:06:42.495 --> 02:06:44.957]  We're aware that when they ring the bell, they want us to salivate.
[02:06:45.780 --> 02:06:48.161]  Others, well, they're going to have program responses.
[02:06:48.181 --> 02:06:49.161]  That's key.
[02:06:49.241 --> 02:06:50.961]  Don't, when they ring the bell, don't salivate.
[02:06:50.981 --> 02:06:52.682]  That's as important as the term red pill, blue pill.
[02:06:52.942 --> 02:06:54.822]  So for those that don't know, tell people what a HOTEP is.
[02:06:56.183 --> 02:07:03.665]  A HOTEP is a, an individual who understands our world in a very 360 degree fashion.
[02:07:03.705 --> 02:07:07.466]  So some people might say it's a religion or it's a political party.
[02:07:08.026 --> 02:07:12.707]  No, I mean, there's probably the three basic acts, um, um,
[02:07:13.918 --> 02:07:16.460]  Aspects of HOTEP is mind, body, and soul.
[02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:18.021]  We believe in a higher power.
[02:07:19.422 --> 02:07:23.044]  We believe in having a healthy body, having a healthy food supply.
[02:07:23.625 --> 02:07:28.908]  And we believe in education and educating yourself.
[02:07:29.389 --> 02:07:36.233]  But we are aware of the traps that are set for us by the oligarchs and the plutocracy.
[02:07:36.594 --> 02:07:40.016]  We are the mind of the black community.
[02:07:40.803 --> 02:07:57.551]  Every ounce of black education outside of the liberal fed education that the black community has, every ounce of self-knowledge has come from a HOTEP, whether it were Marcus Garvey, Kaba Kamenei, or Shaka.
[02:07:58.151 --> 02:07:58.752]  It doesn't matter.
[02:07:59.112 --> 02:08:00.172]  It came from a HOTEP.
[02:08:00.773 --> 02:08:05.415]  Noble Drew Ali, Harvey Spencer Lewis, whoever it was, it came from somebody who was HOTEP.
[02:08:06.630 --> 02:08:16.372]  And we are the consciousness of the black community, the unconsciousness of the black communities of foolishness you see on TV that's purported by the white liberals and the movies and the record labels.
[02:08:20.632 --> 02:08:31.674]  If you look at old school Tupac Shakur, look at his pictures with Digital Underground when he had the kente claw, and he donned the kente claw, and he donned the kufi.
[02:08:32.254 --> 02:08:35.395]  At one point, the black community was HOTEP.
[02:08:36.545 --> 02:08:45.692]  And somehow, some way, the white liberal was able to convince us that the better thing to do was to push gangster rap and consumerism.
[02:08:46.272 --> 02:08:55.840]  And we went from being people who had their own brands and their own culture to being pimps, to being pimped out to brands.
[02:08:56.780 --> 02:08:58.742]  LVMH, so on and so forth.
[02:08:59.222 --> 02:09:00.884]  Well, Ho-Chap, I didn't know you were going to do that.
[02:09:01.735 --> 02:09:02.876]  But you just hit the nail on the head.
[02:09:02.936 --> 02:09:08.759]  I put this out today and asked the listeners, what do you allegorically think this symbolizes?
[02:09:08.779 --> 02:09:11.780]  Because people love esoteric instead of things being right up front.
[02:09:12.661 --> 02:09:31.051]  And that's my answer for the chessboard, is if we don't pull back and see the whole game, don't play the game, but 360-see the whole game, then we can remove the death out of our culture that's designed to destroy true thinking, and then we can start flourishing and have a future for black, white, everybody together.
[02:09:31.351 --> 02:09:32.411]  We'll still have competition.
[02:09:32.451 --> 02:09:33.332]  We'll still have a game.
[02:09:33.672 --> 02:09:40.353]  But it'll be better for everybody to boost empowerment instead of boosting deception and the knowledge of evil.
[02:09:40.653 --> 02:09:42.934]  We need the knowledge of good, which we've forgotten.
[02:09:43.234 --> 02:09:45.135]  And that was the allegory of the day.
[02:09:45.175 --> 02:09:46.935]  And I'm glad you answered the question.
[02:09:48.695 --> 02:09:49.536]  Yes, I love that.
[02:09:49.636 --> 02:09:50.696]  I play chess myself.
[02:09:51.735 --> 02:09:52.836]  And I love that allegory.
[02:09:53.557 --> 02:09:58.222]  We have not enough bishops, not enough knights, not enough kings, not enough queens.
[02:09:58.803 --> 02:10:01.226]  And our board is flooded with pawns.
[02:10:01.326 --> 02:10:03.168]  And the problem is... I was going to say that too!
[02:10:03.228 --> 02:10:04.310]  That's what I meant this morning.
[02:10:04.350 --> 02:10:05.912]  What was don't be a pawn, folks.
[02:10:06.212 --> 02:10:08.535]  Pull back and then you will be one of the main players.
[02:10:09.035 --> 02:10:10.878]  Only by seeing the full board do you get it.
[02:10:12.500 --> 02:10:16.501]  Because imagine, if he's right down here as a pawn, he can't even see five feet.
[02:10:17.441 --> 02:10:22.403]  But if you pull back from the whole thing, it's so simple, and study the manipulation, then they can't control you as easy.
[02:10:23.423 --> 02:10:30.805]  Yeah, you gotta pull back and see everything as a whole, but, you know, a lot of people are Houghton Mifflin educated.
[02:10:30.925 --> 02:10:34.967]  They're educated by the public school system, so they have no sense of even U.S.
[02:10:35.007 --> 02:10:39.388]  history, let alone their own quote-unquote black history.
[02:10:40.763 --> 02:10:42.664]  People don't have a sense of world history.
[02:10:42.944 --> 02:10:50.087]  If you don't know the cycles of the world and of the nations, how a nation rise and how a nation falls, you will never understand the place we live in now.
[02:10:50.107 --> 02:10:51.508]  Let's talk about the cycles of history.
[02:10:51.548 --> 02:10:52.828]  It's been a year since you came on.
[02:10:52.848 --> 02:10:54.069]  I want you to be a regular guest.
[02:10:54.509 --> 02:10:55.629]  Please come back next week.
[02:10:55.669 --> 02:10:56.730]  Do a special report with us.
[02:10:56.990 --> 02:10:58.631]  Do a two-hour commercial-free podcast.
[02:10:58.651 --> 02:10:59.251]  You want to do it soon?
[02:11:00.720 --> 02:11:03.681]  I'd like to do something really big with you with Uncle Ho-Tep.
[02:11:03.801 --> 02:11:07.302]  I'd like to do something in studio with Uncle Ho-Tep.
[02:11:07.322 --> 02:11:08.162]  Let's throw a budget.
[02:11:08.562 --> 02:11:09.402]  Let's do something.
[02:11:09.422 --> 02:11:11.503]  Let's create some really awesome viral content.
[02:11:11.523 --> 02:11:11.943]  I'll tell you what.
[02:11:11.963 --> 02:11:12.703]  You name the time.
[02:11:12.723 --> 02:11:14.263]  If you're ready to jump on a plane, please come.
[02:11:14.303 --> 02:11:15.003]  I'll finance it.
[02:11:15.264 --> 02:11:15.704]  Ho-Tep.
[02:11:15.944 --> 02:11:17.224]  HoTepNation.com.
[02:11:17.484 --> 02:11:17.924]  We love you.
[02:11:17.944 --> 02:11:18.644]  We appreciate you.
[02:11:18.944 --> 02:11:19.405]  Godspeed.
[02:11:20.705 --> 02:11:21.165]  Godspeed.
[02:11:21.645 --> 02:11:24.466]  We'll be right back with your phone calls in hour number four.
[02:11:24.566 --> 02:11:25.066]  Stay with us.
[02:11:26.650 --> 02:11:27.290]  Thanks for holding.
[02:11:27.310 --> 02:11:28.792]  I appreciate you all calling in.
[02:11:28.852 --> 02:11:31.393]  I'm going to now go to every caller in the two segments we have left.
[02:11:32.274 --> 02:11:33.715]  Let's talk to Greg and then Aaron.
[02:11:33.795 --> 02:11:35.196]  Greg in Iowa, thanks for holding.
[02:11:35.216 --> 02:11:38.859]  So you're former law enforcement and vet, you're on the air.
[02:11:38.879 --> 02:11:39.239]  Go ahead.
[02:11:39.299 --> 02:11:39.779]  What's your view?
[02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:42.842]  Trump's got to drop the hammer.
[02:11:43.282 --> 02:11:44.283]  He's got to stop talking.
[02:11:44.703 --> 02:11:45.784]  Bar's got to stop talking.
[02:11:46.244 --> 02:11:47.425]  DOJ's got to stop talking.
[02:11:47.605 --> 02:11:48.946]  They have to drop the hammer.
[02:11:49.667 --> 02:11:53.409]  Those commanders of the National Guard have to be removed immediately for cause.
[02:11:54.030 --> 02:11:55.711]  They have dropped their oath.
[02:11:56.641 --> 02:12:01.723]  Allowing their soldiers to take a knee is unspeakable.
[02:12:02.503 --> 02:12:04.924]  As a former veteran, it is unspeakable.
[02:12:05.164 --> 02:12:07.005]  Isn't that the same as handing somebody the flag?
[02:12:07.665 --> 02:12:07.885]  Yes.
[02:12:08.926 --> 02:12:09.706]  They surrendered.
[02:12:10.006 --> 02:12:11.387]  They surrendered their position.
[02:12:11.727 --> 02:12:13.828]  They might as well have just handed over their weapons.
[02:12:14.528 --> 02:12:15.248]  You don't do that.
[02:12:16.129 --> 02:12:18.610]  I mean, what would these guys do if they were actually getting attacked by an enemy?
[02:12:18.650 --> 02:12:19.490]  This is just pathetic.
[02:12:19.966 --> 02:12:20.286]  It is.
[02:12:20.787 --> 02:12:21.127]  It is.
[02:12:21.347 --> 02:12:24.310]  Because it shows they're not in control of their own mind or their own orders.
[02:12:24.530 --> 02:12:26.131]  Because they're saying they weren't ordered to do this.
[02:12:26.511 --> 02:12:28.293]  Someone convinced them to do this out there.
[02:12:28.873 --> 02:12:29.414]  Exactly.
[02:12:29.794 --> 02:12:30.314]  Exactly.
[02:12:30.474 --> 02:12:33.016]  That shows no confidence to the people, to the country.
[02:12:33.677 --> 02:12:41.023]  Trump has to, with the Secretary of Defense still having his position after when he came out and
[02:12:41.835 --> 02:12:43.576]  Undermining the President's authority.
[02:12:43.736 --> 02:12:45.396]  The Commander-in-Chief.
[02:12:45.637 --> 02:12:47.137]  Let's stop calling him the President.
[02:12:47.337 --> 02:12:48.618]  He is the Commander-in-Chief.
[02:12:48.698 --> 02:12:49.818]  And you know what's happening.
[02:12:49.918 --> 02:12:51.319]  I mean, I told you yesterday.
[02:12:51.339 --> 02:12:52.219]  It's obvious.
[02:12:52.239 --> 02:12:53.640]  They're making their move on Trump right now.
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:55.040]  This is the big one, folks.
[02:12:55.320 --> 02:12:58.061]  And not just drop the hammer on the violent protesters.
[02:12:58.441 --> 02:13:00.422]  They've got to drop the hammer on Hillary and the rest of them.
[02:13:00.622 --> 02:13:02.103]  We don't just need congressional hearings.
[02:13:02.523 --> 02:13:06.847]  We need action now by the executive branch because these people are working with foreign powers.
[02:13:07.067 --> 02:13:08.688]  People go, Alex, that's a police state.
[02:13:08.868 --> 02:13:09.389]  No, it's not.
[02:13:09.629 --> 02:13:13.372]  Letting them lawlessly overthrow the elected government is going to give us a police state.
[02:13:14.112 --> 02:13:14.653]  Exactly.
[02:13:15.013 --> 02:13:15.934]  Exactly, Alex.
[02:13:17.215 --> 02:13:25.502]  Second off, as a former law enforcement officer, my police academy, my police academy did not ever teach that maneuver.
[02:13:26.262 --> 02:13:30.446]  And if you're, the guest you had on the other day was absolutely right.
[02:13:30.826 --> 02:13:32.107]  And once you're placed in handcuffs,
[02:13:32.904 --> 02:13:35.546]  You don't put somebody down on the ground like that.
[02:13:35.566 --> 02:13:38.268]  You place them up so they can breathe.
[02:13:38.708 --> 02:13:40.169]  There's something fishy going on with that.
[02:13:40.189 --> 02:13:41.310]  We don't have all the details.
[02:13:41.330 --> 02:13:43.932]  You're absolutely 100% right on that.
[02:13:44.012 --> 02:13:46.914]  Yet again, yet again my brother, yet again.
[02:13:46.934 --> 02:13:49.817]  And the hammer's got to drop.
[02:13:49.857 --> 02:13:55.080]  The weakness showed by the DOJ for the last three years is allowing this.
[02:13:55.781 --> 02:13:58.383]  And these governors need to start being arrested themselves.
[02:13:59.546 --> 02:14:04.070]  Well, Northam literally keeps babies alive and takes their organs as a doctor.
[02:14:04.811 --> 02:14:08.854]  He literally is going to try to pull down the Robert E. Lee statue to cause an explosion.
[02:14:09.435 --> 02:14:11.737]  I mean, talk about yelling fire in a theater.
[02:14:12.057 --> 02:14:12.558]  This is it.
[02:14:12.798 --> 02:14:13.939]  And he's such a pimp.
[02:14:14.099 --> 02:14:15.520]  I mean, he's such a crook.
[02:14:15.540 --> 02:14:18.423]  I mean, we're going to let this little thug cause a race war?
[02:14:19.464 --> 02:14:19.744]  No.
[02:14:19.984 --> 02:14:23.727]  And that's why the Department of Justice has shown that they're not a Department of Justice.
[02:14:24.388 --> 02:14:25.729]  They are a Department of Lawyers.
[02:14:27.483 --> 02:14:28.084]  Instigators.
[02:14:28.825 --> 02:14:29.947]  This has got to stop.
[02:14:31.420 --> 02:14:39.203]  You gotta stop calling it an insurrection and start treating this as a civil war.
[02:14:39.323 --> 02:14:39.683]  Exactly.
[02:14:39.743 --> 02:14:41.924]  It's not an insurrection directed by a bunch of looters.
[02:14:42.044 --> 02:14:43.264]  It's the media and the mayors.
[02:14:43.544 --> 02:14:47.166]  The Austin mayor came out yesterday and said this is good and the police are bad.
[02:14:47.586 --> 02:14:49.326]  We've had our vehicle attacked repeatedly.
[02:14:50.427 --> 02:14:53.968]  There's just rioting and looting and crime and people being assaulted.
[02:14:54.488 --> 02:14:59.290]  My son had to protect a clerk from a guy that jumped over the counter and was trying to kill him.
[02:14:59.750 --> 02:15:02.351]  I mean, it's just rampant crime right now all over the country.
[02:15:03.032 --> 02:15:04.272]  I am in Podunk, Iowa.
[02:15:04.392 --> 02:15:05.853]  We don't even have our roads paved.
[02:15:06.053 --> 02:15:09.435]  We have gravel roads about an hour south of Minnesota.
[02:15:11.196 --> 02:15:13.317]  We have a huge uptick in crime.
[02:15:14.037 --> 02:15:15.338]  Houses being broken into.
[02:15:15.438 --> 02:15:17.639]  People have never had these problems before.
[02:15:18.059 --> 02:15:21.881]  We have a huge influx of unmarked vehicles.
[02:15:22.661 --> 02:15:23.742]  Generally, they're all white.
[02:15:24.482 --> 02:15:25.923]  Generally, brand spanking new.
[02:15:26.643 --> 02:15:28.344]  People that aren't usually from here.
[02:15:28.977 --> 02:15:42.924]  This is Podunk, Iowa, and people are scoping out stuff in farms and the back roads, and Trump has got to send a message that it's over.
[02:15:43.625 --> 02:15:46.406]  And you're not going to do that with words and placating this stuff.
[02:15:47.067 --> 02:15:49.128]  You said it, there are criminals casing.
[02:15:49.528 --> 02:15:52.790]  I'm seeing casing going on, not just a huge crime increase.
[02:15:53.911 --> 02:15:55.853]  And that's really a big problem, I tell you.
[02:15:55.913 --> 02:15:57.094]  All right, God bless you, Greg.
[02:15:57.234 --> 02:15:58.015]  Thank you for the call.
[02:15:58.035 --> 02:16:00.597]  All right, we gotta jam in all five of these calls when we come back.
[02:16:00.637 --> 02:16:01.878]  That gives each caller about two minutes.
[02:16:02.318 --> 02:16:05.401]  Aaron, Duncan, Frank, Reed, and Justin, we're coming right to you.
[02:16:05.441 --> 02:16:08.103]  Then Jason Jones has got a big guest on, and so much more.
[02:16:08.143 --> 02:16:10.205]  Then Owen Schroyer and the War Room.
[02:16:10.685 --> 02:16:12.887]  Infowars.com forward slash show.
[02:16:14.308 --> 02:16:19.653]  So folks, turns out George Floyd had coronavirus, they're saying, from the autopsy.
[02:16:19.673 --> 02:16:20.934]  Also had no fentanyl in him to kill.
[02:16:23.226 --> 02:16:23.806]  Several people.
[02:16:24.867 --> 02:16:28.549]  Folks, they count every death as coronavirus.
[02:16:28.850 --> 02:16:32.952]  All over the country, in blue states, they count gunshot wounds and car wrecks as that.
[02:16:33.513 --> 02:16:35.094]  So, it's just a giant fraud.
[02:16:35.154 --> 02:16:36.034]  It's totally collapsed.
[02:16:36.815 --> 02:16:39.957]  And all these idiot Democrats are still wearing their masks because they're never going to stop.
[02:16:40.657 --> 02:16:45.540]  They want the power to put vaccines in you, the power to run your life, and it better stop.
[02:16:46.141 --> 02:16:47.722]  Okay, Aaron in Florida.
[02:16:47.742 --> 02:16:48.803]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:16:48.823 --> 02:16:49.103]  Welcome.
[02:16:50.704 --> 02:16:51.024]  Yes, sir.
[02:16:53.683 --> 02:16:54.303]  Thank you so much.
[02:16:54.483 --> 02:16:56.163]  I've been listening to you since 9-11.
[02:16:57.084 --> 02:16:57.784]  I'm a veteran.
[02:16:58.404 --> 02:16:59.324]  Second Amendment supporter.
[02:16:59.384 --> 02:17:00.704]  Your previous caller was awesome.
[02:17:00.744 --> 02:17:02.225]  The military should never kneel.
[02:17:02.265 --> 02:17:03.105]  That was a surrender.
[02:17:03.625 --> 02:17:05.165]  Those commanders should be yanked out of there.
[02:17:07.126 --> 02:17:08.246]  We have the tools, Alex.
[02:17:08.286 --> 02:17:08.706]  We have them.
[02:17:09.206 --> 02:17:10.926]  This is an insurrection in a civil war.
[02:17:11.486 --> 02:17:14.747]  President Trump can actuate Article 2, Section 2.
[02:17:14.867 --> 02:17:17.548]  He's the commander-in-chief of the military, of the militia.
[02:17:18.268 --> 02:17:19.268]  The militia's standing ready.
[02:17:19.915 --> 02:17:24.457]  And what do you make of all these Generals and the SecDef all undermining the President?
[02:17:24.497 --> 02:17:25.357]  That's never happened.
[02:17:26.438 --> 02:17:27.478]  Those guys should be stripped.
[02:17:27.758 --> 02:17:28.399]  They should be stripped.
[02:17:28.439 --> 02:17:30.660]  Well it shows you they're getting ready to make their move on Trump.
[02:17:30.720 --> 02:17:32.901]  I mean, I don't know if Trump understands how dangerous that is.
[02:17:33.841 --> 02:17:34.461]  Exactly right.
[02:17:34.942 --> 02:17:37.503]  Every hair on my body is just standing up right now when you just said that.
[02:17:38.583 --> 02:17:39.584]  The virus lockdown.
[02:17:39.904 --> 02:17:41.705]  We can fight that with U.S.
[02:17:41.765 --> 02:17:45.766]  Code, Title 18, Section 242, deprivation of rights under color of law.
[02:17:47.327 --> 02:17:48.328]  That's how we beat that.
[02:17:50.077 --> 02:17:51.338]  Guys don't have power over us.
[02:17:51.578 --> 02:17:57.703]  Well, I can feel the danger, I can see the danger, and people need to know this isn't the other attempts to take Trump out.
[02:17:58.143 --> 02:18:03.127]  Once they get rid of Trump, they're going to go completely crazy with false flags to cause a real civil war.
[02:18:03.147 --> 02:18:06.750]  And you're right, we're in a civil war now, maybe a three out of a ten.
[02:18:06.790 --> 02:18:12.394]  They want to push it all the way, my friend, because Soros and Hillary and all them, they think they're going to hide out during this thing.
[02:18:12.434 --> 02:18:13.695]  I assure you that's not going to happen.
[02:18:14.896 --> 02:18:17.758]  And speaking of that, Soros and Hillary, so I've been
[02:18:18.683 --> 02:18:30.533]  Following your whole show this time, and I watched on an iPad and a Google FirePad, you were being banned in real time.
[02:18:31.053 --> 02:18:34.996]  When you had Hotep on there, as soon as he started talking, they cut your video feed.
[02:18:36.538 --> 02:18:40.821]  You know, I've been on hold listening to the show and watching this, and it's just, it's a trip.
[02:18:41.141 --> 02:18:46.706]  Anytime you talk about Hotep or anytime George Soros comes on, you get banned immediately.
[02:18:47.775 --> 02:18:49.717]  They are now banning stuff at the browser level.
[02:18:49.737 --> 02:18:51.197]  They're banning it over IPs.
[02:18:51.217 --> 02:18:52.498]  They're banning it absolutely.
[02:18:52.538 --> 02:18:53.099]  God bless you.
[02:18:53.619 --> 02:18:55.040]  And then they confirm they're doing it.
[02:18:55.060 --> 02:19:00.423]  They now force feed their Tuesday blackouts over everything and then use the cover of We Love Black People as a reason to do it.
[02:19:00.483 --> 02:19:03.505]  It's big mega corporations that own slave camps in China.
[02:19:03.965 --> 02:19:05.026]  Nothing to do with black people.
[02:19:05.666 --> 02:19:07.007]  Okay, Duncan in Idaho.
[02:19:07.027 --> 02:19:07.788]  You're on the air, Duncan.
[02:19:07.828 --> 02:19:08.108]  Welcome.
[02:19:09.769 --> 02:19:11.370]  Hey Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:19:12.091 --> 02:19:14.512]  I just wanted to follow up with what Aaron was saying there.
[02:19:14.572 --> 02:19:15.933]  We have all the authority.
[02:19:16.633 --> 02:19:24.577]  Our founders, who the God of our fathers inspired, gave us all the authority in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
[02:19:26.178 --> 02:19:38.103]  In 1901, Downs versus Bidwell, Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan said that two national governments exist, one to be maintained under the Constitution, the other to be maintained
[02:19:38.701 --> 02:19:39.181]  I think?
[02:20:08.874 --> 02:20:15.038]  We rally the three million good men that may be left in this country and we exercise the authority.
[02:20:15.418 --> 02:20:18.160]  Please, please think that over and do that.
[02:20:19.841 --> 02:20:20.581]  Good point, sir.
[02:20:20.642 --> 02:20:21.162]  God bless you.
[02:20:21.182 --> 02:20:21.902]  Anything else, Duncan?
[02:20:23.243 --> 02:20:23.763]  That's it.
[02:20:23.784 --> 02:20:24.504]  Appreciate it.
[02:20:24.524 --> 02:20:25.765]  Appreciate your good heart.
[02:20:26.085 --> 02:20:28.226]  Keep up the fight for truth, right?
[02:20:28.246 --> 02:20:29.287]  Brother, we're in this together.
[02:20:29.367 --> 02:20:30.508]  Thank you for what you're doing.
[02:20:30.548 --> 02:20:31.889]  I tell you, it's totally insane.
[02:20:32.992 --> 02:20:35.233]  But just remember, listeners, we are under hack attack.
[02:20:35.253 --> 02:20:36.993]  We are under a denial of service attack.
[02:20:37.033 --> 02:20:39.754]  We're under all these companies throwing us off constantly.
[02:20:39.774 --> 02:20:41.154]  I don't make a big deal about it.
[02:20:41.214 --> 02:20:42.694]  It's musical chairs to stay on air.
[02:20:42.714 --> 02:20:43.794]  We got satellite uplinks.
[02:20:44.315 --> 02:20:52.496]  Anybody that wants to grab our feed and re-put it out over the internet, re-stream it, you want to pay for a service and put it on your own servers and advertise it and put it out, do it.
[02:20:53.197 --> 02:20:55.457]  And roll your ads over some of our ads.
[02:20:55.597 --> 02:20:56.177]  I don't care.
[02:20:56.237 --> 02:20:56.957]  We're free to air.
[02:20:57.278 --> 02:20:58.938]  Just get the signal out.
[02:21:01.340 --> 02:21:02.001]  Absolutely, that's critical.
[02:21:02.041 --> 02:21:04.122]  Like Art Bell used to say with the ham radio, you know, we need to
[02:21:25.325 --> 02:21:26.145]  Connect with each other.
[02:21:26.165 --> 02:21:31.447]  Yeah, remember back when radio or TV, you know, it didn't watch you, it didn't listen to you, you picked it up?
[02:21:32.388 --> 02:21:33.928]  But now everything tracks you.
[02:21:33.988 --> 02:21:35.309]  What you watch, it watches you.
[02:21:35.369 --> 02:21:36.329]  It's just, it's insane.
[02:21:37.510 --> 02:21:41.831]  Yeah, your grandma used to listen to Rush Limbaugh, you know, Bill O'Reilly was on.
[02:21:42.372 --> 02:21:46.013]  But you know that he was, he was neutral compared to how these guys are now.
[02:21:46.473 --> 02:21:49.174]  Like you, you know, my family defended Texas back then.
[02:21:49.534 --> 02:21:50.455]  And you know, I look white.
[02:21:51.857 --> 02:21:55.059]  You know, handsome, clean cut, white guy like, you know, Owen Schroeder.
[02:21:55.259 --> 02:21:56.840]  But we're trash, you know?
[02:21:57.661 --> 02:22:04.405]  And it's tough, because, you know, I feel the spirit of 1776, 1836, like never before.
[02:22:04.965 --> 02:22:08.767]  I've listened to you throughout the years, kind of, not so much idly.
[02:22:09.248 --> 02:22:10.068]  I've spoken up.
[02:22:10.268 --> 02:22:12.370]  I went to Planned Parenthood to pray the rosary.
[02:22:12.390 --> 02:22:14.811]  You know how evil these people are, you know what I mean?
[02:22:14.831 --> 02:22:18.493]  Well, maybe I met you out there one of those times, if you're calling from Austin.
[02:22:19.833 --> 02:22:24.079]  No, I'm from Amarillo, but you know, I do it in different states, so maybe we did, but I always...
[02:22:25.194 --> 02:22:26.995]  I always see the evil psychopaths.
[02:22:27.015 --> 02:22:29.235]  They're usually wearing the gothic stuff back, you know.
[02:22:29.255 --> 02:22:36.277]  Oh yeah, when you go to an abortion clinic and you're a hundred yards away, people walk over in Antifa and they go, we love Satan, we love killing kids.
[02:22:36.297 --> 02:22:39.978]  And then on national TV, women go, I love murdering my baby.
[02:22:40.239 --> 02:22:41.179]  I ruined its life.
[02:22:42.419 --> 02:22:43.760]  I appreciate your, you're like, whoa.
[02:22:43.820 --> 02:22:45.660]  I mean, I can play those, I can play those clips, folks.
[02:22:46.060 --> 02:22:47.781]  These people are turned over to evil.
[02:22:47.821 --> 02:22:48.381]  They're gone.
[02:22:48.901 --> 02:22:49.921]  Stop bowing to them.
[02:22:50.362 --> 02:22:51.122]  But instead we bow.
[02:22:51.362 --> 02:22:52.642]  Oh, I represent a black person.
[02:22:52.682 --> 02:22:53.903]  I'm an Antifa white person.
[02:22:54.123 --> 02:22:54.563]  Bow to me.
[02:22:56.032 --> 02:22:57.192]  Which is the sign of being a slave.
[02:22:57.312 --> 02:22:58.313]  Reid in Florida.
[02:22:58.593 --> 02:22:59.353]  Reid, thanks for holding.
[02:22:59.373 --> 02:22:59.753]  Go ahead.
[02:23:00.553 --> 02:23:01.553]  Hey, Alex.
[02:23:01.893 --> 02:23:15.897]  When Owen brought up the Crooked Batch and the Floyd video, and if you go back and watch that, both the police officers have two different batches on, and the license plate on the police car says police.
[02:23:16.677 --> 02:23:20.438]  I have never heard of a police car with a police license plate.
[02:23:21.218 --> 02:23:24.459]  So I started looking more into it, and you can actually look this up.
[02:23:25.222 --> 02:23:35.889]  There has been, I know in Madrid and a few other places, riots because of police brutality with the same kneeling on the neck.
[02:23:37.370 --> 02:23:44.675]  And I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but after Owen brought up that that cop's badge was crooked,
[02:23:45.382 --> 02:23:46.742]  I started looking into it.
[02:23:47.042 --> 02:23:48.423]  Yeah, they just pulled up photos.
[02:23:48.463 --> 02:23:54.304]  I've seen this where the exact thing has been done in city after city and country after country.
[02:23:54.324 --> 02:23:55.165]  There it is in Madrid.
[02:23:56.225 --> 02:23:57.165]  There it is in Paris.
[02:23:57.425 --> 02:23:58.526]  And there it is in Minneapolis.
[02:23:59.126 --> 02:24:00.346]  Who knows if it's a PSYOP?
[02:24:00.406 --> 02:24:01.846]  I mean, they need this to trigger stuff.
[02:24:01.866 --> 02:24:02.867]  Who knows what's really going on?
[02:24:03.547 --> 02:24:05.507]  You know, you've seen so many other things staged.
[02:24:06.148 --> 02:24:10.369]  You've seen, you know, the whole... I mean, so many things turn out to be staged.
[02:24:10.389 --> 02:24:11.909]  So it's okay to ask that question.
[02:24:11.969 --> 02:24:12.729]  Reid, I'm out of time.
[02:24:13.330 --> 02:24:13.690]  30 seconds.
[02:24:13.790 --> 02:24:14.350]  Finish your point.
[02:24:14.370 --> 02:24:14.590]  Sorry.
[02:24:17.182 --> 02:24:17.582]  He's gone.
[02:24:18.043 --> 02:24:19.644]  Okay, Frank and Mass, thanks for holding.
[02:24:19.664 --> 02:24:20.044]  Go ahead.
[02:24:22.005 --> 02:24:22.666]  Yeah, can you hear me?
[02:24:22.986 --> 02:24:23.286]  Yes, sir.
[02:24:23.306 --> 02:24:23.706]  Go ahead.
[02:24:24.627 --> 02:24:25.447]  Okay.
[02:24:26.888 --> 02:24:32.372]  I wonder if the new administration can release files on the murders of Biggie and Tupac.
[02:24:32.392 --> 02:24:34.153]  This is white people at JFK.
[02:24:34.533 --> 02:24:43.279]  Maybe that would diffuse the situation because Greta Thunberg is quoted as saying, sidestepping her youth is what Tupac said.
[02:24:43.739 --> 02:24:45.000]  Another thing, communists
[02:24:45.701 --> 02:24:47.302]  Do a hit-and-run attack.
[02:24:47.762 --> 02:24:51.083]  They play peaceful one side and then they attack on the other.
[02:24:51.343 --> 02:24:55.164]  They are trying to now cut off highways here in Massachusetts.
[02:24:55.544 --> 02:24:58.025]  The trucks won't be able to go through and provide food.
[02:24:59.006 --> 02:25:03.387]  Oh yeah, everything is about shutting the economy down, killing confidence, so we give up.
[02:25:03.487 --> 02:25:08.649]  They want to wreck the country so communists can take over who work for a bunch of dirty Nazis like Soros.
[02:25:10.549 --> 02:25:11.950]  The one thing I disagree with you
[02:25:12.660 --> 02:25:21.503]  Is that I think you should come up with a documentary called the Trump Deception because Trump is acting like Truman with a military on their knees.
[02:25:22.143 --> 02:25:23.003]  I can't believe it.
[02:25:23.823 --> 02:25:25.064]  Anyway, that's all I got.
[02:25:25.264 --> 02:25:29.385]  Well listen, call me back another time and I want to hear your criticisms of Trump.
[02:25:29.565 --> 02:25:31.866]  We should probably have a whole show with criticisms of Trump.
[02:25:32.246 --> 02:25:38.428]  We have Jason Jones and a guest about to take over for the next three segments and then we've got Owen Schwerer coming to the War Room.
[02:25:38.468 --> 02:25:39.188]  Please don't forget.
[02:25:40.387 --> 02:25:42.208]  We got this big sale that is about to end.
[02:25:42.228 --> 02:25:43.768]  60% off across the board.

[02:25:50.351 --> 02:25:52.612]  Living Defense, Turbo Force, X3.
[02:25:52.672 --> 02:25:55.153]  It's all 60% off, and the special will end.
[02:25:55.353 --> 02:25:56.614]  Your purchase supports the broadcast.
[02:25:56.654 --> 02:25:57.494]  Thank you all for your support.
[02:25:59.255 --> 02:26:01.116]  Aloha, world!
[02:26:01.796 --> 02:26:09.339]  My name is Jason Jones, coming to you, not from my office today, but from my kids' homeschool room on the west side of Oahu, and
[02:26:10.498 --> 02:26:11.438]  I love InfoWars.
[02:26:11.838 --> 02:26:14.199]  That Hotep Jesus, who is that guy?
[02:26:14.219 --> 02:26:16.940]  One of the best men I've ever heard talk in my life.
[02:26:17.500 --> 02:26:19.741]  And that's who you find on InfoWars.com.
[02:26:19.761 --> 02:26:21.121]  And that's who this audience is.
[02:26:21.661 --> 02:26:30.104]  For me, to talk to you in the midst of this crisis is a great honor because this is the most important audience in the world.
[02:26:30.764 --> 02:26:36.086]  I know right now there are young people who are out on the streets looting.
[02:26:37.924 --> 02:26:42.187]  But you think you might have been duped or tricked and you want to know what's really going on.
[02:26:42.327 --> 02:26:43.587]  So you peek in at InfoWars.
[02:26:43.628 --> 02:26:44.548]  I see you peeking in.
[02:26:45.148 --> 02:26:52.673]  Right now there are police officers and members of the National Guard wanting to know what is really going on here and you are watching InfoWars.
[02:26:53.413 --> 02:26:58.496]  And there are patriots across the country and there are people who love liberty across the world.
[02:26:58.817 --> 02:27:02.019]  And so for me to talk to you is quite a privilege.
[02:27:02.679 --> 02:27:07.482]  Through my organization, Movie to Movement, we run a program called the Vulnerable People Project.
[02:27:08.058 --> 02:27:15.285]  And what we seek to do is use our connections in government, in politics, in media, to advance the interests of the vulnerable.
[02:27:15.305 --> 02:27:23.092]  From the child in the womb, to the child in Chinese-occupied East Turkestan, to the Chaldeans and Assyrian Christians in Iraq and Syria.
[02:27:23.753 --> 02:27:25.414]  And we do these calls every Friday.
[02:27:25.434 --> 02:27:29.458]  And last week, on the call, I talked to Juliana Tamarazzi.
[02:27:30.177 --> 02:27:34.321]  Who is an Assyrian Christian from Iran who works in Iraq.
[02:27:34.762 --> 02:27:36.524]  And I said, I need to have you on InfoWars.
[02:27:36.544 --> 02:27:44.652]  I need to have you on the Alex Jones Show because the Christians in the Middle East, they in Iraq just survived ISIS.
[02:27:45.473 --> 02:27:47.695]  And now we're going to have a global food shortage.
[02:27:48.485 --> 02:27:55.212]  And there's already hunger creeping across India, from Bangladesh, India, across the Middle East into Africa.
[02:27:55.852 --> 02:28:01.017]  And so these vulnerable communities and conflict zones, we need to have you on.
[02:28:01.398 --> 02:28:05.081]  So Juliana, welcome to the show, but I'm gonna pivot on you.
[02:28:05.241 --> 02:28:05.822]  Good to see you.
[02:28:06.963 --> 02:28:07.664]  Nice to see you.
[02:28:07.684 --> 02:28:08.645]  Thank you for having me on.
[02:28:09.721 --> 02:28:11.442]  Well, Juliana, you're a hero of mine.
[02:28:11.482 --> 02:28:16.943]  You escaped from Iran as a young teenager, came to the United States.
[02:28:16.963 --> 02:28:24.686]  You didn't forget where you came from and you've been a consistent advocate for the persecuted church in the Middle East and especially in Iraq as an Assyrian Christian.
[02:28:25.376 --> 02:28:32.519]  We were going to talk about the plight of Christians in the Middle East today, but the world has erupted since our conference call last week.
[02:28:32.919 --> 02:28:36.060]  And what I want to talk to you about is President Trump.
[02:28:36.240 --> 02:28:39.201]  We want to talk about justice, social justice.
[02:28:39.661 --> 02:28:44.203]  Justice is doing your responsibility, amending for what you've done wrong.
[02:28:44.978 --> 02:28:55.100]  And President Trump is being attacked this week because he went to a church, held up a Bible, and then he went to the shrine of St.
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:29:04.922]  John Paul II, and then committed $50 million in support for persecuted Christians in Iraq, a country that we destroyed, that we invaded, and then left.
[02:29:06.342 --> 02:29:08.443]  So in the midst of everyone screaming justice,
[02:29:09.321 --> 02:29:17.784]  President Trump is trying to do an act of reparations to support communities made vulnerable by our war and our failed foreign policy, and he's being attacked.
[02:29:18.544 --> 02:29:22.506]  How, as an Assyrian Christian, does this—I mean, what would you say to this?
[02:29:24.627 --> 02:29:27.408]  Well, first of all, there's so much to say, Jason.
[02:29:27.428 --> 02:29:28.528]  There's so much to say.
[02:29:28.548 --> 02:29:33.830]  I don't know if there was ever another president that stood as much as he has for
[02:29:34.574 --> 02:29:34.834]  I think.
[02:29:55.097 --> 02:30:01.601]  For decades, the persecuted church there, including my own organization that partners with these people on the ground.
[02:30:01.701 --> 02:30:06.485]  So there has been a real change that this administration has brought forth.
[02:30:06.845 --> 02:30:18.012]  The $50 million that you mentioned, as you spoke of, the executive order was signed, and we're grateful for that, for international religious freedom, domestically and foreign.
[02:30:18.352 --> 02:30:22.355]  And the $50 million was not only allocated for the Iraqi Christians,
[02:30:22.688 --> 02:30:29.290]  But I think it's for all of the foreign policies to look at those foreign policies that impact religious freedom abroad.
[02:30:29.390 --> 02:30:31.051]  So I wanted to make that correction.
[02:30:31.131 --> 02:30:32.772]  But we're really grateful.
[02:30:32.912 --> 02:30:35.793]  We're really grateful for what is being done today.
[02:30:35.853 --> 02:30:43.116]  But there's so much more that needs to get done because really Iraq has been completely destroyed with the U.S.
[02:30:43.136 --> 02:30:45.396]  intervention there in Iraq.
[02:30:45.556 --> 02:30:46.737]  And there's so much work to do.
[02:30:47.776 --> 02:30:51.380]  And I'm so happy to be here to be able to inform your audience about our existence.
[02:30:51.420 --> 02:30:54.743]  First of all, that the Assyrians exist still from the Old Testament.
[02:30:55.144 --> 02:31:00.390]  A lot of people think that we're decimated, that we've disappeared, but there are about 3 million of us left in the world.
[02:31:00.810 --> 02:31:05.475]  Living in our homeland, only 150,000 of us are still left in the homeland.
[02:31:05.515 --> 02:31:08.759]  The rest of us are in the diaspora and there's so much to do and there's so much to talk about.
[02:31:09.656 --> 02:31:12.497]  You're an Assyrian Christian living in Chicago.
[02:31:12.537 --> 02:31:16.959]  There are a lot of Assyrian Christians in Chicago, a lot of Chaldean Christians from Iraq in Chicago.
[02:31:17.479 --> 02:31:23.982]  Your governor last week said that any church that dare open during this lockdown, he would raise to the ground.
[02:31:24.162 --> 02:31:24.822]  Did you hear that?
[02:31:24.842 --> 02:31:28.184]  Did you hear him say that, Governor Pritzker?
[02:31:29.105 --> 02:31:36.610]  I have not myself have heard it, but I've read some reports and I've heard through the grapevine, so I haven't seen it with my own eyes, truth be told.
[02:31:37.230 --> 02:31:52.940]  However, if this indeed is true, I'm hoping that his words were mistaken or they were taken out of context because there are over 100,000 Athenians and Chaldeans and also Syriacs that live up from the Middle East that have taken refuge here.
[02:31:53.866 --> 02:31:56.488]  And this means a lot.
[02:31:56.969 --> 02:32:05.976]  It means differently to us when anyone talks about destroying the church, looting the church, setting the church on fire, or razing the church.
[02:32:06.556 --> 02:32:17.605]  That only reminds us of what al-Qaeda and what ISIS did in Iraq and Syria and what the Islamic Republic of Iran is doing by closing down our churches there.
[02:32:17.625 --> 02:32:20.147]  This is, for us, really
[02:32:21.933 --> 02:32:23.574]  It's an abomination for us.
[02:32:23.874 --> 02:32:28.976]  If this really indeed is true, it's a scary, scary fact.
[02:32:29.596 --> 02:32:30.977]  Julianne, it's sad and it's true.
[02:32:30.997 --> 02:32:37.179]  We've had de Blasio in New York, Governor Pritzker in Illinois, both say that they would raise churches to the ground.
[02:32:37.779 --> 02:32:42.161]  We have what I would call their allies in Antifa, which is American ISIS.
[02:32:42.581 --> 02:32:47.343]  I used to try to explain to my friends that ISIS is not related to Islam at all.
[02:32:47.483 --> 02:32:48.704]  There are Muslim extremists.
[02:32:49.444 --> 02:32:51.825]  ISIS, they're just gangs of violent criminals.
[02:32:51.865 --> 02:32:57.447]  And if we were to see a breakdown in society in the United States, we would see similar gangs of violent criminals.
[02:32:57.847 --> 02:33:05.970]  And I see ISIS, I mean, Antifa is really, they have the potential of growing into something as violent as ISIS.
[02:33:07.050 --> 02:33:10.272]  And if they were unchecked, I don't think they would check themselves.
[02:33:10.312 --> 02:33:16.614]  They're extremely violent and they've shown that they're capable of anything, including setting churches on fire.
[02:33:17.282 --> 02:33:20.544]  And so now we have this violent group Antifa, American ISIS.
[02:33:21.065 --> 02:33:23.426]  I call them uber-fascists, not anti-fascists.
[02:33:24.267 --> 02:33:34.934]  And you have elected officials allied to Antifa like Cuomo and Pritzker and de Blasio who are threatening to raze churches to the ground in the United States of America.
[02:33:37.235 --> 02:33:41.658]  You know, I came to this country 30 years ago as a refugee, as a legal refugee.
[02:33:41.758 --> 02:33:47.042]  So the America that I came to 30 years ago is quite different than the America that I live in today.
[02:33:47.591 --> 02:33:50.394]  Which is quite very serious and very scary to me.
[02:33:50.414 --> 02:33:57.363]  I can't tell you how many of my community members who have taken refuge in America, they say, where are we going to go?
[02:33:58.344 --> 02:34:02.809]  This was going to be our homeland, because our homeland has been taken away from us in Northern Iraq.
[02:34:03.269 --> 02:34:07.334]  And here we are, where are we going to go after this if our religious freedom is going to be...
[02:34:08.860 --> 02:34:09.921]  We have 30 seconds.
[02:34:09.981 --> 02:34:10.962]  We're not going anywhere.
[02:34:11.062 --> 02:34:12.383]  We're fighting for our country.
[02:34:12.723 --> 02:34:14.484]  My ancestors came before yours.
[02:34:14.604 --> 02:34:15.445]  You came here.
[02:34:16.065 --> 02:34:17.967]  You and I are going to fight for our posterity.
[02:34:18.247 --> 02:34:19.188]  We're not going anywhere.
[02:34:19.208 --> 02:34:20.328]  We're going to save this republic.
[02:34:20.348 --> 02:34:22.350]  The Infowars audience is the tip of that spear.
[02:34:22.650 --> 02:34:24.892]  How do people follow you and support the church in Iraq?
[02:34:26.353 --> 02:34:31.096]  irakechristianrelief.org irakechristianrelief.org Please help us.
[02:34:31.116 --> 02:34:33.418]  We cannot serve the persecuted church without you.
[02:34:33.718 --> 02:34:34.739]  And on Facebook as well.
[02:34:34.819 --> 02:34:36.880]  irakechristianreliefcouncil Thank you, Juliana.
[02:34:37.321 --> 02:34:37.661]  Thank you.
[02:34:38.636 --> 02:34:41.277]  Aloha, welcome back to Hour 4 of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:41.317 --> 02:34:44.639]  I'm your guest host, Jason Jones, coming to you from the west side of Hawaii.
[02:34:44.659 --> 02:34:47.540]  When they open up the economy, they open up my state.
[02:34:47.580 --> 02:34:53.102]  I hope you come back here, that you visit us, because we are at almost 40% unemployment.
[02:34:54.282 --> 02:34:55.543]  It's unbelievable.
[02:34:56.203 --> 02:35:01.706]  I was listening to HOTEP Jesus in the last segment, and I thought, we need some HOTEP Christians.
[02:35:02.206 --> 02:35:05.047]  We need some Christians that think about a transcended truth.
[02:35:05.675 --> 02:35:06.756]  We need some Christian leaders.
[02:35:06.816 --> 02:35:07.336]  I'm Catholic.
[02:35:07.356 --> 02:35:11.939]  We need some Catholic leaders to think about some transcendent truth, to think about justice.
[02:35:12.359 --> 02:35:13.220]  What is justice?
[02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:21.505]  The best answer ever given, in my mind, was by Socrates in the Republic, when he said, justice is doing what it is yours to do.
[02:35:21.525 --> 02:35:28.250]  He admitted he didn't really, wasn't able to use philosophy to get us to know what we are supposed to do.
[02:35:28.928 --> 02:35:33.712]  But as a Christian, that was given to us in the Gospel, to love God and love your neighbor.
[02:35:33.892 --> 02:35:34.753]  So that's justice.
[02:35:35.193 --> 02:35:42.318]  As a human being, justice is me being kind, thoughtful, and loving to my Creator and to my neighbor.
[02:35:42.659 --> 02:35:53.307]  But yet, we have a bunch of virtue signaling priests, bishops, religious leaders across all denominations who lack the courage to say the hard truth.
[02:35:54.462 --> 02:36:06.452]  The job, I thought, of really old religious leaders was not to play to the crowd, not to play to the mob, to say the things that get you nailed to a cross, that drag down onto the street and beat.
[02:36:06.772 --> 02:36:09.894]  I thought that was the job of religious leaders.
[02:36:10.295 --> 02:36:11.956]  I guess not anymore.
[02:36:12.556 --> 02:36:23.665]  Joining me is the most influential Catholic podcaster in the world, and I think a thorn in the side of a lot of virtue signaling social justice warriors in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church.
[02:36:24.205 --> 02:36:30.069]  Taylor Marshall, welcome to the Alex Jones Show that has the greatest audience in the world.
[02:36:30.569 --> 02:36:31.230]  How you doing, brother?
[02:36:32.110 --> 02:36:33.391]  Howdy from Texas to you.
[02:36:33.631 --> 02:36:34.172]  Aloha.
[02:36:35.312 --> 02:36:35.873]  Aloha.
[02:36:36.933 --> 02:36:38.655]  Howdy is Texan for aloha.
[02:36:39.475 --> 02:36:39.915]  Pretty much.
[02:36:40.196 --> 02:36:40.596]  Pretty much.
[02:36:40.956 --> 02:36:41.296]  All right.
[02:36:41.676 --> 02:36:50.022]  So, I see on the news that you have this priest who is like a walking prop, James Martin, condemning
[02:36:50.868 --> 02:36:53.849]  President Trump for using the Bible as a prop.
[02:36:54.149 --> 02:36:58.371]  Which struck me as odd, because James Martin's whole life is a prop.
[02:36:59.311 --> 02:37:03.253]  And then you have bishops and other people across denominations.
[02:37:03.293 --> 02:37:05.514]  You're formally an Episcopal priest.
[02:37:06.014 --> 02:37:11.796]  You have Episcopalians, priests, Catholic bishops, and others who are virtue signaling.
[02:37:12.877 --> 02:37:15.318]  What is the failure that's happening, Taylor?
[02:37:15.338 --> 02:37:18.279]  Their religious leaders now no longer have courage to speak truth.
[02:37:20.194 --> 02:37:22.795]  Well, you've got priests like James Martin.
[02:37:22.815 --> 02:37:23.555]  He's a Jesuit.
[02:37:25.035 --> 02:37:31.517]  He's been appointed by Pope Francis as a consulter on the Dicastery for Communications in the Vatican, so it's kind of a big deal.
[02:37:32.817 --> 02:37:35.818]  He speaks in a way here in America for the Vatican.
[02:37:35.838 --> 02:37:49.462]  And what we've really seen since the 1960s is clergy, and this is all the way from priests to monsignors, pastors, bishops, archbishops, cardinals, now you could even say a pope,
[02:37:50.379 --> 02:38:03.407]  Who are no longer pushing that old-time religion, the religion of Jesus Christ and the Apostles, where they say, repent for the kingdom of God is at hand.
[02:38:03.608 --> 02:38:04.828]  Believe in me.
[02:38:05.329 --> 02:38:06.850]  Jesus was born of the Virgin.
[02:38:06.910 --> 02:38:07.410]  He died.
[02:38:07.470 --> 02:38:08.731]  He rose on the third day.
[02:38:08.771 --> 02:38:09.852]  He ascended into heaven.
[02:38:09.892 --> 02:38:11.213]  He sent down the Holy Ghost.
[02:38:11.813 --> 02:38:17.637]  He called people to take care of the poor and those that were in need and to live a life of sacrifice.
[02:38:17.717 --> 02:38:19.478]  Instead, what they're saying is,
[02:38:21.027 --> 02:38:23.688]  Let's support the governments.
[02:38:24.388 --> 02:38:28.229]  Let's support the UN, the EU, and these initiatives.
[02:38:28.309 --> 02:38:34.270]  And they're compromised because there's so much money funneling down from those institutions.
[02:38:34.310 --> 02:38:43.633]  And so what we have is an infiltration of corrupt clergy who are preaching not the gospel, not the Bible, but the status quo.
[02:38:43.673 --> 02:38:47.994]  So when they see Donald Trump stand in front of a church and hold up a Bible, they flip out.
[02:38:49.693 --> 02:38:51.274]  It doesn't fit in their paradigm.
[02:38:52.175 --> 02:39:00.241]  Taylor, he goes to a shrine to pray for the persecuted church, does an executive order giving $50 million for the church.
[02:39:00.301 --> 02:39:01.802]  You want to talk about justice?
[02:39:02.743 --> 02:39:05.805]  Justice is doing what is your responsibility to do.
[02:39:06.145 --> 02:39:07.667]  The United States invaded Iraq.
[02:39:07.787 --> 02:39:09.648]  Obama pulled our troops out early.
[02:39:10.028 --> 02:39:11.790]  The country collapsed into hell.
[02:39:12.430 --> 02:39:17.374]  ISIS committed genocide to the Christian communities of Iraq that had been there since the first century.
[02:39:17.935 --> 02:39:26.043]  The president, in the midst of all of this, finds time to go pray for them, finds time to sign an executive order to give aid to them.
[02:39:26.764 --> 02:39:28.285]  Isn't that social justice?
[02:39:29.046 --> 02:39:31.768]  Isn't that what these people say they're clamoring for?
[02:39:32.889 --> 02:39:41.558]  It's not the just social justice, and they don't use... See, every time you have to add the word social to the word justice, you're being tricked, people.
[02:39:42.558 --> 02:39:51.561]  As you stated earlier, Jason, justice as articulated by Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, you could even say the New Testament, St.
[02:39:51.661 --> 02:39:57.563]  Paul, Thomas Aquinas, justice is doing your duty to God and your neighbor.
[02:39:58.664 --> 02:40:00.404]  So justice is always social.
[02:40:00.484 --> 02:40:08.907]  Anytime they add the word social to social justice, like social justice warriors, what they're trying to do is creep a little bit of socialism into your justice.
[02:40:09.548 --> 02:40:10.708]  And we got to just reject that.
[02:40:11.690 --> 02:40:14.831]  Actually, whenever I hear social justice used, it's unjust.
[02:40:15.492 --> 02:40:18.533]  They're advocating something that is not just.
[02:40:19.293 --> 02:40:20.714]  It's class warfare.
[02:40:21.234 --> 02:40:23.535]  It's race riots.
[02:40:23.595 --> 02:40:24.315]  It's all these things.
[02:40:24.355 --> 02:40:26.336]  It's putting people against each other.
[02:40:26.896 --> 02:40:29.477]  Societal identities against one another.
[02:40:29.917 --> 02:40:36.360]  And in reality, what should be happening is we should be aiding the most vulnerable.
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:37.700]  The elderly.
[02:40:37.720 --> 02:40:39.001]  The poor.
[02:40:39.781 --> 02:40:43.242]  Those who have been hit hardest by this COVID-19 overhype.
[02:40:44.162 --> 02:40:46.643]  Let's talk about the unborn, the babies in the womb.
[02:40:47.043 --> 02:40:49.623]  More babies are dying in the womb than there are of COVID or riots.
[02:40:50.324 --> 02:40:52.544]  But any time you bring these things up... Social justice is easy, right?
[02:40:53.244 --> 02:40:54.845]  Taylor, social justice is easy.
[02:40:55.145 --> 02:41:03.527]  Social justice is taking my $300 skateboard, $300 skateboard my mommy bought me, smash out a window and steal a surfboard.
[02:41:04.407 --> 02:41:05.367]  That's social justice.
[02:41:06.107 --> 02:41:09.228]  Justice is paying down your student loans yourself.
[02:41:10.200 --> 02:41:22.488]  Social justice is, I became a father at 18, a reckless teenager, is being a teen parent, working that night shift, getting up, being a good employee, being respectful to my employers and to customers.
[02:41:22.849 --> 02:41:23.989]  Justice is hard.
[02:41:25.650 --> 02:41:28.552]  Social justice is a cakewalk.
[02:41:28.953 --> 02:41:29.833]  It's a riot.
[02:41:30.514 --> 02:41:35.597]  Social justice is the love of the idea of humanity.
[02:41:36.898 --> 02:41:38.019]  I love humanity.
[02:41:38.339 --> 02:41:39.720]  I'm a humane person.
[02:41:40.359 --> 02:41:44.784]  Justice is, I love this miserable neighbor next door to me.
[02:41:44.804 --> 02:41:47.787]  I love these babies who are being killed.
[02:41:47.867 --> 02:41:51.211]  I love these people in the nursing homes who are being euthanized.
[02:41:51.892 --> 02:41:54.675]  That's the real nitty-gritty where you're actually loving
[02:41:55.296 --> 02:41:55.896]  Just false clerics!
[02:42:15.748 --> 02:42:37.216]  Promote this because they can use their collar and they can use their miter and they can use their pulpits and they can hide behind the traditional trappings of Christianity and promote the same message of George Soros, Cuomo, Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden, all of which show up in church, all of which hold up Bibles.
[02:42:37.276 --> 02:42:39.777]  Bill Clinton's in the same spot as Trump holding up the Bible.
[02:42:40.842 --> 02:42:42.863]  Nancy Pelosi has her photo op of the Bible.
[02:42:42.903 --> 02:42:43.783]  Cuomo has his.
[02:42:44.223 --> 02:42:46.524]  Nancy Pelosi's in Catholic masses.
[02:42:46.924 --> 02:42:57.668]  They're using all the props of religion to accelerate and to lift up and promote the false agenda of globalism, secularism, and the destruction of the family.
[02:42:59.529 --> 02:43:04.811]  What is the root cause of religious leaders conforming to the gods of the city?
[02:43:05.311 --> 02:43:07.172]  You would think an elderly bishop
[02:43:08.061 --> 02:43:10.302]  Like you have in Washington D.C.
[02:43:10.362 --> 02:43:13.524]  who has been connected to known pedophiles.
[02:43:14.324 --> 02:43:25.850]  What is it that would have an elderly man who has supposedly spent his life in prayer playing to the mob instead of really being thoughtful for the vulnerable people in Washington D.C.?
[02:43:27.150 --> 02:43:27.991]  Final word, Jason?
[02:43:28.431 --> 02:43:30.412]  They don't believe in Jesus Christ.
[02:43:30.452 --> 02:43:31.652]  They don't believe in God.
[02:43:31.672 --> 02:43:32.473]  They don't believe in any of this.
[02:43:33.416 --> 02:43:35.397]  So they're getting their reward here on heaven.
[02:43:35.618 --> 02:43:43.503]  They're getting their pockets lined, they're getting the sensual pleasures and what they want from the flesh, and they will work the agenda of the elites.
[02:43:44.064 --> 02:43:44.584]  They don't believe.
[02:43:44.604 --> 02:43:45.565]  They just don't.
[02:43:46.625 --> 02:43:47.906]  Taylor, we've got 30 seconds left.
[02:43:47.946 --> 02:43:50.228]  You did a great show on this this week.
[02:43:50.268 --> 02:43:51.529]  How do people watch your show?
[02:43:52.443 --> 02:43:54.505]  Yeah, go to YouTube, Dr. Taylor Marshall Show.
[02:43:54.785 --> 02:43:55.826]  Just search Taylor Marshall Show.
[02:43:55.846 --> 02:44:10.979]  I did a couple videos on Trump declaring church as essential and the kind of war between him and Bill Gates and the war between him and James Martin and a bunch of these globalist elites and these tech powers who are trying to ultimately enslave us and track us.
[02:44:12.141 --> 02:44:14.663]  Well, keep shining the spotlight on these corrupt clergy.
[02:44:14.683 --> 02:44:15.804]  Taylor Marshall, thank you very much.
[02:44:20.697 --> 02:44:37.143]  When we look at the challenges facing us today, the lens of the 20th century, and the modern ideologies that claimed almost 200 million innocent lives, and the virtues that could have saved those lives, you might well feel dispirited.
[02:44:38.523 --> 02:44:46.926]  You and I are no match for demagogues who craft big lies to turn ordinary people into genocidal mobs.
[02:44:48.322 --> 02:44:56.685]  We cannot take down all the sophists who weave from fashionable half-truths a silk shroud to mask our everyday evils.
[02:44:57.885 --> 02:45:05.588]  Even the stories of heroes who risked all they had in the fight for human dignity can seem impossibly out of reach.
[02:45:06.741 --> 02:45:10.282]  We can tell ourselves that we are not made of the same kind of stuff.
[02:45:11.063 --> 02:45:17.545]  The fiber that lets a man defy his nation's government, its ruling elites, its secret police.
[02:45:18.326 --> 02:45:23.708]  We are just regular Joes and Janes, and life will not ask us to make this sort of sacrifice.
[02:45:24.448 --> 02:45:26.509]  It had better not, because we will fail.
[02:45:28.015 --> 02:45:29.076]  But that is a lie.
[02:45:29.776 --> 02:45:41.825]  The same kind of lie that subhumanism tells us about each other, about our neighbors and spouses and children, and especially about strangers who look or think or pray just a little bit different.
[02:45:42.906 --> 02:45:46.488]  The heroes among us prove that this simply isn't true.
[02:45:47.709 --> 02:45:55.735]  The texture of their lives and the sacrifices they made prove that each and every one of us can do more.
[02:45:56.735 --> 02:45:57.556]  We can be better.
[02:45:58.504 --> 02:46:06.868]  Neither Jerome Lejeune, nor Marianne Yap, nor Jersey Pope Iescu was born with special powers, wearing a halo or in a manger.
[02:46:07.809 --> 02:46:12.671]  Ordinary human beings like me and you, they were confused and frightened and tempted.
[02:46:13.672 --> 02:46:21.816]  Each one of them could have made very different choices, could have trumbled along and averted his eyes from the truths that were being trampled.
[02:46:23.371 --> 02:46:30.277]  Subhumanism, for all the intellectual or political masks it wears, says just one central thing.
[02:46:31.237 --> 02:46:33.139]  That man doesn't really matter all that much.
[02:46:34.220 --> 02:46:43.087]  That there is nothing in us that exceeds or transcends the ugliness of Darwinian competition, the limits of biology, the inevitability of death.
[02:46:44.449 --> 02:46:45.309]  That is a lie.
[02:46:46.070 --> 02:46:49.371]  And we can treat people as if they were robots, ghosts, or beasts.
[02:46:49.971 --> 02:46:53.552]  We can starve, enslave, imprison them, or kill them.
[02:46:54.553 --> 02:46:56.213]  But that doesn't change the reality.
[02:46:56.974 --> 02:47:03.096]  If we look up, and also within, we find the mysterious image and likeness of God.
[02:47:04.116 --> 02:47:08.978]  We will discover the truth that we and our neighbors have an incomparable beauty and worth.
[02:47:09.927 --> 02:47:11.748]  A dignity that no one can take away.
[02:47:12.529 --> 02:47:23.776]  Our thousand-year reichs, our workers' paradises, or this brave new world, are ghastly fantasies that human beings create, and that history duly comes along and exposes.
[02:47:24.977 --> 02:47:36.684]  And what is left behind, bruised and battered but still unbowed, is the face of man, as noble and as beautiful as Adam, reaching out his hand to the God who made him.
[02:47:37.745 --> 02:47:38.726]  We will remember that,
[02:47:39.710 --> 02:47:40.990]  And we will do what is needed.
[02:47:42.051 --> 02:47:56.595]  We will feel from the depths of our hearts, to the highest flights of our imagination, a love of the good, a hatred of cruelty, a smallness of soul, and a loyalty to each and every member of our family, the human family.
[02:47:57.555 --> 02:48:04.257]  We will fight to enshrine the basic principles of decency in our political, economic, and personal lives.
[02:48:05.177 --> 02:48:06.097]  We will have courage.
[02:48:06.898 --> 02:48:07.638]  We will prevail.
[02:48:14.534 --> 02:48:15.134]  All right, thank you.
[02:48:23.458 --> 02:48:24.438]  Welcome back, guys.
[02:48:24.958 --> 02:48:25.699]  Welcome back, guys.
[02:48:25.739 --> 02:48:28.660]  That is the afterword to my book, The Race to Save Our Century.
[02:48:29.480 --> 02:48:34.923]  And when I wrote this book, one of the first people I wanted to get it to was Alex Jones.
[02:48:35.103 --> 02:48:43.026]  And so now that I get to be on his show, sharing with his audience the message of this book, which I think is really timely.
[02:48:43.994 --> 02:48:53.121]  Alex has been telling us for two decades, as Info Warriors, you've been trying to tell your family and friends, we've seen what's happening coming.
[02:48:53.141 --> 02:48:56.623]  They're trying to divide us, turn us against our own family members.
[02:48:57.324 --> 02:49:00.066]  With the COVID crisis, they have family against family.
[02:49:00.446 --> 02:49:01.807]  Wear a mask, don't wear a mask.
[02:49:01.867 --> 02:49:03.548]  Social distance, don't social distance.
[02:49:03.969 --> 02:49:04.869]  That was the jab.
[02:49:05.810 --> 02:49:09.433]  Now they're throwing the straight right, trying to divide us with this
[02:49:10.784 --> 02:49:12.406]  COVID was a trumped up crisis.
[02:49:12.506 --> 02:49:13.687]  Not that it wasn't real.
[02:49:14.347 --> 02:49:15.648]  And not that there isn't racism.
[02:49:15.968 --> 02:49:17.069]  But this is a fake.
[02:49:17.790 --> 02:49:20.892]  America was united that this was a horrible travesty of justice.
[02:49:21.353 --> 02:49:25.836]  America was united that this man, George Floyd, should receive justice.
[02:49:26.197 --> 02:49:29.739]  How can they use something that America was united on to divide us?
[02:49:30.800 --> 02:49:34.383]  You are watching this because you know we are being played.
[02:49:35.464 --> 02:49:37.846]  I want to just for these last couple of minutes again,
[02:49:38.379 --> 02:49:42.380]  Just with you, ask the question, what is justice?
[02:49:42.920 --> 02:49:48.501]  Because there's all this talk about justice, and no one even is thinking what it is.
[02:49:49.122 --> 02:49:55.183]  Justice is simple to understand, hard to be, like any virtue.
[02:49:55.763 --> 02:49:58.844]  Justice is doing what it is yours to do.
[02:49:59.324 --> 02:50:02.785]  Socrates, the direct translation is minding your own business.
[02:50:03.165 --> 02:50:05.926]  But minding your own business sounds like don't eavesdrop on your neighbor.
[02:50:06.306 --> 02:50:07.146]  That's not what he meant.
[02:50:07.893 --> 02:50:18.219]  Socrates meant that justice is doing what it is yours to do, is care for your children, care for your parents, tend to your flock.
[02:50:18.639 --> 02:50:21.440]  Whatever it is yours to do, you do that.
[02:50:22.381 --> 02:50:27.023]  You don't tell other people what it is theirs to do until you do what it is yours to do.
[02:50:27.043 --> 02:50:33.947]  He even admitted that at the end of the day, I can't use philosophy to find out what it is mine to do.
[02:50:33.967 --> 02:50:35.508]  We're blessed.
[02:50:36.924 --> 02:50:40.788]  Thanks to the gospel of Jesus Christ, we know what it is ours to do.
[02:50:41.728 --> 02:50:45.231]  Love our God, love God, and love our neighbor.
[02:50:45.752 --> 02:50:48.054]  But loving a neighbor is challenging.
[02:50:48.654 --> 02:50:51.637]  Loving our neighbor is hard, and we often fail.
[02:50:52.177 --> 02:50:56.561]  And that's why we're told that we will be judged by the measure in which we judge.
[02:50:57.002 --> 02:50:59.083]  Do we forgive people for wronging us?
[02:51:00.064 --> 02:51:02.466]  Do we forgive people for being unjust?
[02:51:02.947 --> 02:51:04.508]  Because we have all wronged people.
[02:51:05.106 --> 02:51:06.727]  We have all been unjust.
[02:51:07.507 --> 02:51:25.077]  So as this whole, our whole country is clamoring, violence in the streets, acts of injustice, police officers being shot, shop owners being punched in the face, homeless people having their little bed and their little cart thrown around by Antifa mobs.
[02:51:25.558 --> 02:51:26.598]  That is unjust.
[02:51:28.337 --> 02:51:41.330]  I have never seen my country behave, having a little girl because she's white, hold a sign that says, I'm privileged, taking a child to a protest where you know she's going to be pepper sprayed, keeping her out past the curfew.
[02:51:41.811 --> 02:51:42.912]  That is unjust.
[02:51:43.792 --> 02:51:51.220]  But this InfoWars audience is precious and special because it transcends the ideological spectrum.
[02:51:51.875 --> 02:51:53.816]  It transcends ethnicity.
[02:51:54.276 --> 02:52:00.800]  We are all here, members of every community, every ethnicity, and every part of this country is here.
[02:52:01.220 --> 02:52:15.469]  So what I want us all to do, and it's hard, you know, you saw me when I was at the urgent care and I got upset and heated and argued with that director of the medical clinic and Alex said, you need to apologize to her.
[02:52:15.869 --> 02:52:17.790]  You know, you were a little too angry.
[02:52:17.810 --> 02:52:19.351]  He's like, I've done the same thing myself.
[02:52:20.054 --> 02:52:27.890]  We all now is the time that we have to know with Alex with that board with the chessboard and he had
[02:52:28.638 --> 02:52:29.719]  The skull in the middle.
[02:52:30.199 --> 02:52:34.323]  The only problem with that chessboard is it doesn't really reflect reality, right?
[02:52:34.343 --> 02:52:38.006]  In my family, I have my children are mixed.
[02:52:38.526 --> 02:52:40.708]  My sister's husband is Mexican.
[02:52:40.728 --> 02:52:44.771]  In my family, I literally have Hawaiian, Filipino, Chinese, black, Mexican.
[02:52:45.072 --> 02:52:46.313]  So many families are the same.
[02:52:46.613 --> 02:52:50.176]  So that chessboard doesn't really depict who we really are because we are each other.
[02:52:50.376 --> 02:52:52.598]  There's never been a country in the world
[02:52:53.238 --> 02:52:57.581]  More united than this country, but yet they have been successful.
[02:52:58.241 --> 02:53:05.045]  It appears they're being successful in dividing a country that has never been more thoughtful to each other, more loving, more kind, and more just.
[02:53:05.525 --> 02:53:08.006]  And George Floyd demonstrated that.
[02:53:08.627 --> 02:53:13.149]  Our president, and I don't agree with everything the guy does or everything he says.
[02:53:13.329 --> 02:53:16.091]  I don't agree with everything my wife believes, we argue.
[02:53:17.391 --> 02:53:26.836]  But he was ahead of the governor of Minnesota and the mayor of Minneapolis in assuring George's family that there will be justice.
[02:53:27.637 --> 02:53:28.858]  And now they want to scapegoat him.
[02:53:29.738 --> 02:53:38.463]  But the honor and privilege to talk to this audience and to share with you, I have to say, I have never sold more copies of my book
[02:53:39.119 --> 02:53:45.386]  Before the show, I think we've sold 10,000 copies total since the book came out and it is selling so fast.
[02:53:45.746 --> 02:53:47.028]  Thanks to the InfoWars audience.
[02:53:47.088 --> 02:53:50.872]  And I want to remind you again, I wrote this book, The Race to Save Our Century.
[02:53:51.293 --> 02:53:56.839]  And that video you just saw is the afterword because I wanted to know how to order my life.
[02:53:57.319 --> 02:54:01.882]  To leave to my children and their children into our posterity, a culture of life, love and beauty.
[02:54:02.523 --> 02:54:04.084]  And that's why I wrote that book.
[02:54:04.524 --> 02:54:11.909]  If you go to our website, thegreatcampaign.org for a donation of $20, that is literally our cost for the book, for the packaging and for the shipping.
[02:54:12.410 --> 02:54:15.632]  You get a free copy of my book and it is a tax deductible donation.
[02:54:15.652 --> 02:54:18.574]  If you want to do more, we'd love you to do more, but $20 is our cost.
[02:54:21.949 --> 02:54:24.351]  This book is for you, InfoWarriors.
[02:54:24.791 --> 02:54:28.254]  Let's go out and show our family, friends, and neighbors what it is to be bold.
[02:54:28.515 --> 02:54:30.056]  Speak popular untruths.
[02:54:31.037 --> 02:54:34.600]  That isn't the just thing we can do now, but do it in a way that's kind and loving.
[02:54:34.960 --> 02:54:36.862]  So to the InfoWar audience, aloha.
[02:54:48.621 --> 02:54:51.903]  We told you what was going to happen, and it did.
[02:54:52.343 --> 02:54:54.644]  Now we're telling you what's coming.
[02:54:56.265 --> 02:54:58.686]  Band.Video.
[02:55:03.028 --> 02:55:05.490]  The United States is under attack.
[02:55:06.721 --> 02:55:10.742]  Our country's not perfect, but it's our nation and has a Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[02:55:10.782 --> 02:55:19.624]  It's been very successful and has been the number one country where the average person has a chance to become successful and to become happy and to live out their dreams.
[02:55:20.664 --> 02:55:30.027]  Powerful multinational corporations that exploit human populations all over the world to levels beyond any horror movie or H.P.
[02:55:30.087 --> 02:55:30.907]  Lovecraft novel
[02:55:31.767 --> 02:55:45.940]  Are the very ones now setting up this tyranny in America and knowing that we care about race relations and knowing that we care and we have a basic Christian ethos still, they play on that and say, you're racist, you're bad.
[02:55:46.681 --> 02:55:52.447]  And when out of 350 million people, something sad happens to somebody,
[02:55:53.737 --> 02:56:00.762]  At the hands of police officers like George Floyd, even if they're all charged, and even if they all go to prison, it doesn't matter.
[02:56:00.802 --> 02:56:03.284]  It's your fault because you're white.
[02:56:04.204 --> 02:56:15.672]  But it's white billionaires controlling things, saying that they want to divert from their crimes, their corruption, their illegal surveillance of the population on to
[02:56:17.307 --> 02:56:19.408]  Telling us that we're all individually bad?
[02:56:19.869 --> 02:56:33.417]  And now after three months of a lockdown and top scientists coming out and saying COVID-19 is a giant hoax designed to destroy the economy, now they move on to destroying the economy with looting and rioting and race war.
[02:56:33.577 --> 02:56:35.458]  It is absolutely evil.
[02:56:36.178 --> 02:56:38.460]  And now Senator Cotton of Arkansas has come out.
[02:56:39.673 --> 02:56:39.913]  I think?
[02:56:55.310 --> 02:56:58.673]  And will not call out the National Guard so the police are overwhelmed.
[02:56:58.713 --> 02:57:01.975]  This is an attempt to further stall the economy and bring down the country.
[02:57:02.355 --> 02:57:04.957]  And this will hurt the most disadvantaged Americans the most.
[02:57:05.237 --> 02:57:09.240]  And this is a diabolical crime that absolutely must be punished.
[02:57:09.821 --> 02:57:13.644]  The Justice Department has announced its opening criminal investigation of who's behind Antifa.
[02:57:14.164 --> 02:57:15.725]  Soros and Alexander Soros.
[02:57:16.206 --> 02:57:18.307]  And these organizations, they fund like refusefascism.org.
[02:57:20.086 --> 02:57:22.187]  Who are the groups that run this?
[02:57:22.607 --> 02:57:24.308]  We have all the documents.
[02:57:24.708 --> 02:57:26.129]  We have all the proof.
[02:57:26.409 --> 02:57:27.890]  Friends of Democracy.
[02:57:28.670 --> 02:57:35.393]  These are the organizations that operated under Obama and the Clintons with impunity and are engaging in a massive criminal takeover.
[02:57:35.573 --> 02:57:41.896]  But we've got General Mattis and George W. Bush and all and George Will that said he didn't care about the primaries for Trump.
[02:57:41.916 --> 02:57:45.218]  That it should be overwritten because the plurality of the people didn't matter.
[02:57:45.398 --> 02:57:46.659]  These are monsters.
[02:57:47.239 --> 02:57:50.860]  And they're launching this attack on you and your rights and your freedom.
[02:57:51.741 --> 02:57:52.941]  And they're deadly dangerous.
[02:57:53.241 --> 02:57:54.422]  So see the chessboard.
[02:57:55.022 --> 02:57:56.783]  And see that they're using you as a pawn.
[02:57:57.543 --> 02:57:58.863]  And decide not to play their game.
[02:57:59.144 --> 02:58:00.984]  Expose the entire game.
[02:58:01.544 --> 02:58:02.425]  With the truth.
[02:58:03.025 --> 02:58:03.865]  With the justice.
[02:58:04.266 --> 02:58:04.946]  With freedom.
[02:58:05.726 --> 02:58:10.548]  But I just want listeners to know and I want you to understand that without your support we're not going to be here.
[02:58:11.028 --> 02:58:15.330]  And we are running a sale that absolutely will end on Sunday and then it's over.
[02:58:16.070 --> 02:58:19.174]  It is the flash 60% off sale that I launched on Monday.
[02:58:19.634 --> 02:58:30.126]  It's the biggest sale not just of this year, but arguably the biggest sale we've ever done because across the board all of these amazing supplements are 60% off.
[02:58:30.947 --> 02:58:31.808]  We're good.
[02:58:49.730 --> 02:58:51.251]  That's how we fund this operation.
[02:58:51.451 --> 02:58:52.332]  They're great products.
[02:58:52.372 --> 02:58:53.673]  Get some t-shirts while you're at it.
[02:58:53.973 --> 02:58:55.934]  It's all there at infowarestore.com.
[02:58:56.154 --> 02:58:59.416]  And that's how you fund the Second American Revolution and get high quality products.
[02:58:59.616 --> 02:59:01.418]  So thank you all for your support.
[02:59:01.518 --> 02:59:02.558]  Please take action now.
[02:59:10.223 --> 02:59:15.707]  As the pressure to wear masks in public rises, it's important to be able to keep yourself safe while making a statement.
[02:59:17.335 --> 02:59:20.418]  That's why we created a limited edition InfoWars face mask.
[02:59:21.899 --> 02:59:28.204]  The easiest way to stay safe from incoming germs, while showing your support for patriotism and freedom in the face of tyranny.
[02:59:30.286 --> 02:59:35.670]  Easy to use, just slip it on on your way to work, the store, or anywhere that mandates a mask around you.
[02:59:38.653 --> 02:59:44.498]  These also make great gifts or purchases for friends, family members, neighbors, or anyone else concerned about their safety in public.
[02:59:46.181 --> 02:59:48.524]  If you want to stay safe, you might as well stay stylish.
[02:59:49.044 --> 02:59:53.209]  Get the limited edition InfoWars face mask today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:00:23.300 --> 03:00:26.565]  When do you think the people should be able to, like, talk again?
[03:00:26.585 --> 03:00:29.909]  Oh yeah, that's a good question.
[03:00:31.011 --> 03:00:33.374]  Well, Alex Jones at least has Infowars.com.
[03:00:33.394 --> 03:00:35.296]  He can do his own thing and people go to that.
[03:00:35.356 --> 03:00:36.879]  And Gavin's got a show still.
[03:00:36.919 --> 03:00:37.199]  Does he?
[03:00:37.379 --> 03:00:39.242]  Yeah, you know, as someone who's kind of
[03:00:39.842 --> 03:00:41.103]  All for free speech.
[03:00:41.763 --> 03:00:49.886]  I often get told that I'm bad because I have to defend people whose language I don't agree with.
[03:00:50.306 --> 03:00:52.187]  That is what free speech is.
[03:00:52.407 --> 03:00:55.629]  It's not defending everyone who says things that I love.
[03:00:55.649 --> 03:00:58.270]  It doesn't make any sense because that means you're right all the time.
[03:00:58.670 --> 03:01:01.071]  Like if you're only defending the things that you believe in.
[03:01:01.431 --> 03:01:01.771]  Yeah.
[03:01:01.811 --> 03:01:03.232]  You write all the time about everything?
[03:01:03.272 --> 03:01:12.756]  But I have to defend the people who say things that are even atrocious and that I can't, I would never get on board with because that's what free speech is.
[03:01:12.856 --> 03:01:18.938]  Otherwise, and like you said, it is that slippery slope of who gets to be the arbiter of what is said.
[03:01:18.958 --> 03:01:20.879]  Right, and what are your guidelines?
[03:01:20.999 --> 03:01:23.060]  Alex Jones is funnier than Andy Kaufman's ever been.
[03:01:23.520 --> 03:01:25.661]  Alex Jones is f***ing hilarious often.
[03:01:25.761 --> 03:01:28.182]  Did you see the whole that he's Bill Hicks?
[03:01:28.662 --> 03:01:28.902]  Yeah.
[03:01:29.082 --> 03:01:29.843]  Conspiracy.
[03:01:29.863 --> 03:01:30.323]  That's not real.
[03:01:30.823 --> 03:01:32.043]  I went down that rabbit hole.
[03:01:32.063 --> 03:01:32.903]  That's the silliest shit ever.
[03:01:33.003 --> 03:01:34.364]  I know, but there are videos.
[03:01:34.784 --> 03:01:40.745]  But he had one thing we're talking about, like if it's between his family starving or eating his neighbor.
[03:01:40.765 --> 03:01:41.485]  Oh, I know.
[03:01:41.505 --> 03:01:42.545]  He's like, I'll eat your ass.
[03:01:42.786 --> 03:01:44.226]  And so it became this giant, come on.
[03:01:45.086 --> 03:01:46.466]  I will eat your ass!
[03:01:46.606 --> 03:01:49.507]  Do you don't think there's entertainment value in him saying he's going to eat his neighbor?
[03:01:49.527 --> 03:01:50.047]  Stop my dumpster fire!
[03:01:50.427 --> 03:01:50.627]  Right.
[03:01:50.887 --> 03:01:54.188]  But there's something to that, like to stop that and ban that.
[03:01:55.305 --> 03:02:11.012]  You're not stopping anyone from anything bad by not having Alex do this entertaining thing about eating his neighbor.
[03:02:11.032 --> 03:02:12.213]  You're not saving anybody.
[03:02:12.673 --> 03:02:13.213]  You know what I'm saying?
[03:02:15.940 --> 03:02:16.961]  Like, what are you doing?
[03:02:17.021 --> 03:02:18.762]  Like, what is he doing that's so awful?
[03:02:19.382 --> 03:02:21.984]  I don't know how to fix any of it.
[03:02:22.284 --> 03:02:23.144]  It's entertaining.
[03:02:23.765 --> 03:02:26.787]  Like, why is it only acceptable if you have some kind of entertainment?
[03:02:26.807 --> 03:02:36.913]  Because there's so many rap videos that you could watch that I enjoy, but they're talking about shooting people and robbing people, and it's everywhere on YouTube!
[03:02:36.973 --> 03:02:38.273]  It's so prevalent!
[03:02:38.554 --> 03:02:40.094]  And somehow or another, that's okay.
[03:02:40.835 --> 03:02:44.157]  Like, it's f***ing weird what's allowed and what's not allowed.
[03:02:49.667 --> 03:02:49.887]  I will.
[03:02:50.448 --> 03:02:51.729]  I will eat your ass.
[03:02:51.969 --> 03:02:56.653]  I will eat your leftist ass like corn on the cob.
[03:02:56.793 --> 03:02:57.693]  I'm ready.
[03:02:57.834 --> 03:02:58.414]  I will eat you.
[03:02:58.734 --> 03:03:00.035]  I will eat your ass.
[03:03:00.476 --> 03:03:02.497]  My children aren't going hungry.
[03:03:02.637 --> 03:03:03.098]  I'll do it.
[03:03:03.338 --> 03:03:04.479]  I'll drink your blood.
[03:03:05.159 --> 03:03:08.182]  And I'm starting to think about having to eat my neighbors.
[03:03:08.402 --> 03:03:09.343]  You think I like?
[03:03:09.503 --> 03:03:12.545]  Size it up, I'm gonna haul him up by a chain.
[03:03:12.585 --> 03:03:16.168]  Top his ass up, size it up, I'm gonna haul him up by a chain.
[03:03:16.208 --> 03:03:18.170]  Top, top, top, top, barbecue your ass.
[03:03:19.375 --> 03:03:21.436]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:03:56.772 --> 03:03:57.278]  On your throat.
