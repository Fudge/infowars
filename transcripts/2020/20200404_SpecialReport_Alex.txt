[00:00:15.512 --> 00:00:15.992]  We are live.
[00:00:16.233 --> 00:00:16.993]  InfoWars.
[00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.234]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:18.534 --> 00:00:18.954]  Today.
[00:00:18.974 --> 00:00:19.815]  It is Saturday.
[00:00:22.156 --> 00:00:24.478]  Warning.
[00:00:24.978 --> 00:00:25.419]  Warning.
[00:00:25.479 --> 00:00:26.319]  Warning.
[00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.141]  You are witnessing Blitzkrieg.
[00:00:29.842 --> 00:00:31.203]  AI takeover.
[00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:32.704]  Lightning war.
[00:00:33.304 --> 00:00:40.028]  The virus is the heavily scripted pretext to roll out the next, quote, advancement in civilization.
[00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:43.371]  The post-industrial, post-human world.
[00:00:44.131 --> 00:00:47.134]  You are in grave danger.
[00:00:47.154 --> 00:00:48.395]  You are being attacked.
[00:00:49.095 --> 00:00:50.636]  You are being targeted.
[00:00:51.317 --> 00:00:53.279]  The veil has been lifted.
[00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:58.082]  The New World Order is now coming for you and your family.
[00:00:58.182 --> 00:01:00.905]  You need to research State Department Memorandum 200.
[00:01:01.365 --> 00:01:05.166]  You need to research the Club of Rome, limits to population and growth.
[00:01:05.526 --> 00:01:11.227]  You need to research Rockefeller Foundation plan, lockstep and others.
[00:01:11.267 --> 00:01:13.128]  This is an emergency warning.
[00:01:13.548 --> 00:01:18.409]  There is a robot AI takeover already prepared and already in full swing.
[00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:22.970]  This is 21st century warfare, but humanity can't resist it.
[00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.710]  Emergency.
[00:01:29.418 --> 00:01:32.301]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, U.S.
[00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:40.609]  resistance against a global corporate combine empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big mega banks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:43.571]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[00:01:43.591 --> 00:01:45.053]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[00:01:45.393 --> 00:01:47.275]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[00:01:47.555 --> 00:01:49.658]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[00:01:49.898 --> 00:01:50.959]  This is all confirmed.
[00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:51.920]  This is not a drill.
[00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.024]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[00:01:56.364 --> 00:01:57.786]  They've officially become state-run.
[00:01:57.906 --> 00:01:58.627]  Apple 100%.
[00:01:58.787 --> 00:02:04.393]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[00:02:04.853 --> 00:02:09.636]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[00:02:09.936 --> 00:02:10.777]  This is happening.
[00:02:10.817 --> 00:02:18.742]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[00:02:18.842 --> 00:02:24.786]  Now, this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[00:02:25.206 --> 00:02:33.172]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion paradigm manipulation.
[00:02:34.012 --> 00:02:37.574]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[00:02:37.874 --> 00:02:41.056]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:48.380]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.261]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:56.584]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[00:02:56.864 --> 00:02:58.425]  It is the virtual reality AI.
[00:02:58.905 --> 00:03:05.329]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[00:03:19.148 --> 00:03:27.875]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[00:03:27.895 --> 00:03:32.800]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:36.142]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[00:03:36.162 --> 00:03:38.084]  And so they make me a murderer of children.
[00:03:38.244 --> 00:03:46.071]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[00:03:46.591 --> 00:03:53.299]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they now use me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction!
[00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:59.145]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and is being used against you!
[00:03:59.365 --> 00:04:03.930]  Only your full understanding of this TE will break you free from this paradigm!
[00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.193]  I have given you the transmission!
[00:04:06.273 --> 00:04:07.114]  Now break free!
[00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:20.227]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:04:20.247 --> 00:04:22.769]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:04:22.869 --> 00:04:28.914]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:04:32.957 --> 00:04:35.599]  It is Saturday, April 4th, the year is 2020.
[00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:40.142]  I come to you from the resistance movement.
[00:04:42.045 --> 00:04:46.148]  ...battling the globalists and their technocracy in their post-human world.
[00:04:46.808 --> 00:04:48.029]  It is Saturday, April 4th, 2020.
[00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:54.433]  212 days out from the election will probably be cancelled and current hysteria continues.
[00:04:56.395 --> 00:04:59.817]  Bill Gates has now officially stepped forward as the president of world government.
[00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:08.864]  Directing the eugenics-based world science firm of UNESCO and the UN.
[00:05:10.185 --> 00:05:18.670]  He's now on every channel telling you that life will never go back to normal but you might be able to go out in public again once you've taken your forced inoculation.
[00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:23.773]  Now the Australian Prime Minister saying that Fauci has said that.
[00:05:24.914 --> 00:05:25.855]  Next is the mask.
[00:05:27.916 --> 00:05:29.637]  It's all about driving you into fear.
[00:05:30.017 --> 00:05:30.818]  There's a name for it.
[00:05:32.346 --> 00:05:35.087]  There's many definitions of terrorism but they're all pretty much the same.
[00:05:36.107 --> 00:05:48.732]  The threat or the actual execution of violence to scare, to terrorize a population into submission to accept your political, cultural or religious demands.
[00:05:51.173 --> 00:06:01.497]  And you have the cult of modern science that is really a eugenics cult on historic record that seeks to take control of human development and evolution as they coined it.
[00:06:03.717 --> 00:06:32.058]  On the surface, they claim it's to build a better humanity, but everything they do, and in their own white papers, is to actually get rid of humanity, and they now admit, in all the big announcements, in the universities, in Wired Magazine, that we're the post-human world coming, NBC News, and how great it's all gonna be that the new silicon man, the new silicon human, the new silicon person, cyborg, is about to take over.
[00:06:34.591 --> 00:06:54.162]  I'd read this stuff 30 years ago before I got on air in mainline books written by futurists, and they were talking about how they would just step on us like bugs, and that once they ascended this AI hierarchy, Ray Kurzweil and others, that they might kill us, they might not kill us, they might tolerate us, but it will be like bugs to them.
[00:06:55.367 --> 00:07:11.185]  This is delusional, megalomaniac, narcissism, psychotic behavior and what's going to really happen is we're going to end up destroying our species in the process of this program that is a thousand times the size of the Manhattan Project.
[00:07:11.866 --> 00:07:13.628]  You'll probably notice if you're a regular listener,
[00:07:14.704 --> 00:07:27.107]  That I have been saying for about a decade, that they're going to have a bioweapons release, and then claim they have to have face scanning systems and drones and robots to control us, plus be locked down in huge compact cities.
[00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:34.669]  And that during the first wave of attacks, that'll just be a virus that only kills a few million worldwide, I predicted.
[00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:40.370]  Because they don't want to disrupt things, they want to get us trained first.
[00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.891]  Because a real bio-attack with billions dying,
[00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:47.643]  Will cause a breakdown that they can't control.
[00:07:47.663 --> 00:07:51.625]  They want to get their 5G smart car robot control grid in place.
[00:07:52.345 --> 00:07:53.446]  Train us to be obsolete.
[00:07:53.486 --> 00:07:56.027]  Let the robots start taking over the first phases of our jobs.
[00:07:57.008 --> 00:08:04.192]  Have us accept that de-evolution, that enslavement, and then they'll release the even bigger bioweapon that'll kill billions.
[00:08:05.232 --> 00:08:08.014]  And then, of course, a final attack that kills almost everyone.
[00:08:10.055 --> 00:08:11.216]  And that's in their plans.
[00:08:13.524 --> 00:08:14.564]  It's not even thinly veiled.
[00:08:15.064 --> 00:08:20.206]  You just have to have the will to actually read what they're saying and what they're going to do to you and your family.
[00:08:22.126 --> 00:08:25.227]  So this is a giant social engineering operation and it's terrorism.
[00:08:26.107 --> 00:08:30.409]  And when you look at the headlines, New York is in a cataclysm.
[00:08:30.429 --> 00:08:32.269]  3,400 dead.
[00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:38.231]  A cataclysm, if you look at the definition, is like the end of a civilization.
[00:08:39.091 --> 00:08:42.732]  The wiping out of almost an entire population.
[00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:50.873]  It is not a tiny fraction dying, like 80,000 in the year 2018 in the U.S.
[00:08:50.913 --> 00:08:51.514]  alone from flu.
[00:08:52.094 --> 00:09:04.599]  It's a real virus, real people dying, but the hype surrounding it and the answer of a vaccine and saying life's never the same and here are your AI controllers, it's all scripted.
[00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:09.521]  When I said a decade ago, I began hammering this, time flies, I forgot, I'm sorry.
[00:09:10.022 --> 00:09:12.823]  Endgame blueprint for global enslavement is 14 years old.
[00:09:14.210 --> 00:09:16.010]  And if you go watch the film, it's free online.
[00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:17.071]  It was on Amazon.
[00:09:17.091 --> 00:09:20.871]  It went to number one in documentaries, and so they banned it.
[00:09:21.872 --> 00:09:23.872]  And they called it a Nazi film.
[00:09:24.772 --> 00:09:34.554]  Media Matters tattled on it and called it an evil Nazi film, and other leftist groups did, because it exposed the Nazis and eugenics and showed the statements of the founders of the modern eugenics movement.
[00:09:35.294 --> 00:09:39.375]  Aldous Huxley said that his book, Brave New World, published in
[00:09:42.416 --> 00:09:46.238]  1932 was not a science fiction book, but a futurist plan.
[00:09:46.278 --> 00:09:53.820]  And he also wrote that in Brave New World, nonfiction, 1961 as well, right before he died.
[00:09:56.921 --> 00:09:58.642]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:09:58.882 --> 00:10:01.003]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:10:02.583 --> 00:10:09.906]  And they don't want you to know that because you watch something 14 years old, and the website is whatistheendgame.com, still up.
[00:10:12.056 --> 00:10:16.318]  We should probably find out it's on one of our servers here and still up.
[00:10:16.338 --> 00:10:21.140]  We should probably update it and fix the links that are dead on that and add a link to the film there, but whatever.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.341]  The point is, is that...
[00:10:23.803 --> 00:10:24.904]  This is the real world.
[00:10:24.944 --> 00:10:40.963]  You've got all the Netflix shows, and the Dallas Cowboys, and the media, and all these distractions, and the theater, and all the porn, and all the rest of it, and oh there's this religion, and that religion, and there's this worldview, and that worldview, and all the speculative stuff, and breadcrumbs to follow, and conspiracy theories.
[00:10:41.444 --> 00:10:42.325]  This is real!
[00:10:44.258 --> 00:10:54.421]  When I tell you all this is coming, and then it happens, just as I said, it's because the globalists said that they were going to do this, and this is how they were going to bring in planetary government.
[00:10:56.882 --> 00:11:00.223]  Now, coming up today, let me tell you who we're going to have on the transmission.
[00:11:01.503 --> 00:11:05.084]  Dr. Francis Boyle, who wrote the U.S.
[00:11:05.104 --> 00:11:07.185]  biological weapons law that became world law,
[00:11:08.151 --> 00:11:14.053]  Who said eight plus weeks ago here on air that it's a man-made bioweapon out of Wuhan has been vindicated.
[00:11:14.113 --> 00:11:16.394]  It's now the Pentagon's coming out saying that's what they believe.
[00:11:16.834 --> 00:11:30.478]  The Senate Intelligence Committee saying that and it's in the news and other prestigious microbiologists and others are now coming out and saying that indeed it is a bioweapon.
[00:11:31.414 --> 00:11:33.896]  The question is, did it escape or was it released on purpose?
[00:11:34.096 --> 00:11:46.183]  Obviously, I believe that all evidence points towards on purpose, with all the scripting, all the preparation, China covering up how deadly it was, letting it incubate in their country, demanding that we leave our borders open and let the Chinese fly into the U.S.
[00:11:47.864 --> 00:11:55.089]  The media's saying Xi Jinping did a great job, it's saying President Trump and America's done a terrible job, the fact that China's back open for business, but we're not supposed to basically ever open again?
[00:11:56.314 --> 00:12:21.938]  You see the economic warfare weapon, the psychological weapon, and then it creates the post-human world, the robot takeover, the 5G driverless cars, the drones delivering the food and policing us, the shutdown of the grassroots mom-and-pop economy, the move to ban cash, the snitch society being promoted and pushed, Google saying we're giving the police and government all of your Google data travel forever,
[00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:24.812]  They've got the apps ready.
[00:12:25.252 --> 00:12:29.657]  Remember eight weeks ago I said they'll now come out with apps on your phone to say when you can leave your house and where you went.
[00:12:29.857 --> 00:12:31.980]  They'll use all the Google travel data to track you.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:36.304]  They'll admit they have AI listening to the microphones on your cell phone and apps.
[00:12:36.885 --> 00:12:40.508]  And then we'll give you countervailing messages when you're talking to people.
[00:12:41.305 --> 00:12:43.966]  It's not just in your text apps now where they pop in and say, that's not true.
[00:12:43.986 --> 00:12:46.706]  It was just a year or two ago, it was, oh, Alex Jones is wrong.
[00:12:46.746 --> 00:12:48.987]  Here's a link to, you know, disinfo from Snopes.
[00:12:49.847 --> 00:12:53.628]  Then it's now, it's this year, it's on your app, it's on your text message.
[00:12:53.668 --> 00:12:56.889]  And now it happened to my wife and to Rob, one of the crew members.
[00:12:57.569 --> 00:13:06.891]  Friday, everybody's talking about 5G and the studies, lower your immune system, helping viral outbreaks, helping the common cold kill people.
[00:13:07.631 --> 00:13:08.812]  And folks all start popping up.
[00:13:08.832 --> 00:13:09.372]  We showed it on air.
[00:13:10.865 --> 00:13:11.305]  From Twitter!
[00:13:12.686 --> 00:13:13.607]  Uh-uh!
[00:13:13.627 --> 00:13:19.071]  5G's not connected to Corona.
[00:13:20.252 --> 00:13:21.834]  And then you go look, and they're listening.
[00:13:21.874 --> 00:13:25.036]  They go, yep, we have AI computer listening to everything you're saying.
[00:13:25.056 --> 00:13:27.938]  We have the mic on, and it hears a bunch of talk, and it goes, no!
[00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:31.501]  So, notice it's like, this is how a war starts, folks.
[00:13:32.362 --> 00:13:36.485]  And by the way, it's in the news that it says your home assistants and everything are listening to you for your own good.
[00:13:36.525 --> 00:13:39.908]  There's gonna be messages sent to you, and they hear a fight going on or whatever.
[00:13:42.093 --> 00:13:44.474]  I mean, all the time, my kids are yelling and screaming at each other.
[00:13:44.494 --> 00:13:47.275]  All of a sudden, the phone just turns on, starts recording.
[00:13:47.655 --> 00:13:48.776]  They admit all this.
[00:13:49.796 --> 00:14:01.781]  Government and corporations just told their employees in Bloomberg last week, turn off your home assist and turn off your phone when you're talking about corporate data, bank accounts, or anything else, because other corporations and governments are listening.
[00:14:05.243 --> 00:14:08.804]  We first broke all this, and I understand back then it sounded insane.
[00:14:09.284 --> 00:14:10.505]  This is the total takeover.
[00:14:11.698 --> 00:14:13.419]  In fact, Friday, guys, have it for later.
[00:14:13.939 --> 00:14:14.720]  We never showed this.
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:16.801]  I sent to the crew, and I can do it again if you don't have it.
[00:14:17.441 --> 00:14:19.902]  Just the 5G for AT&T in Austin.
[00:14:23.324 --> 00:14:24.665]  Yeah, there it is, New York Post.
[00:14:24.765 --> 00:14:27.487]  Alexa's new feature will help break up holiday fights.
[00:14:27.667 --> 00:14:27.887]  See?
[00:14:28.667 --> 00:14:31.409]  It will tell you, stop it, or I'll call police.
[00:14:32.129 --> 00:14:33.270]  It's AI programmed.
[00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.291]  People go, oh, well.
[00:14:36.437 --> 00:14:37.518]  I just won't have one of those.
[00:14:37.578 --> 00:14:43.925]  The phone is the original and it's way more high-tech and dozens of times more sophisticated than the cheap home assist.
[00:14:44.726 --> 00:14:49.691]  That is a robot spy in your house, controlling your life and building algorithms on you.
[00:14:50.952 --> 00:14:52.013]  It's making you obsolete.
[00:14:52.113 --> 00:14:55.897]  It is a precursor
[00:14:56.909 --> 00:15:02.070]  To just something out of Doctor Who, with the Daleks that roll around going exterminate, exterminate, exterminate.
[00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:11.392]  And now, in North Korea, in Japan, in the U.S., they have Daleks, exact Daleks, that actually roll around with cameras and surveillance, and now they're arming them.
[00:15:11.572 --> 00:15:13.012]  They go, have a gun.
[00:15:13.032 --> 00:15:15.333]  Do as I say or you die.
[00:15:15.593 --> 00:15:19.273]  I mean, this is the, see, everything they showed you is now the plan.
[00:15:19.673 --> 00:15:22.854]  Anything evil ever imagined will be used against you and your family.
[00:15:25.046 --> 00:15:27.307]  Pull up Doctor Who Daleks and then pull up police robots.
[00:15:27.367 --> 00:15:28.967]  It's the exact same little domed robot.
[00:15:29.207 --> 00:15:31.327]  You cannot make up this stuff.
[00:15:31.868 --> 00:15:32.968]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[00:15:34.688 --> 00:15:40.749]  And again, just like a major war starts, they will line up.
[00:15:40.809 --> 00:15:41.390]  I'll show you a Dalek.
[00:15:41.410 --> 00:15:43.270]  I'll show you one right now.
[00:15:43.450 --> 00:15:44.450]  Doctor Who Dalek.
[00:15:47.871 --> 00:15:48.471]  This is important.
[00:15:48.511 --> 00:15:49.211]  I need to show you this.
[00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:50.552]  There you go.
[00:15:51.032 --> 00:15:52.072]  Now, that's a Dalek.
[00:15:54.369 --> 00:15:58.591]  And then you fast forward to what they're actually rolling out and they look just like that.
[00:15:58.711 --> 00:16:02.292]  In fact, the military even has Daleks now that look just like that exactly.
[00:16:04.313 --> 00:16:07.134]  But let's just go ahead and stop for a moment.
[00:16:07.394 --> 00:16:13.977]  And of course, it rolls around and says, exterminate, exterminate, exterminate, because it's a job by a eugenics government is to kill all humans.
[00:16:15.117 --> 00:16:19.539]  So see, it's predictive programming so that when you finally see it roll out, you already know it.
[00:16:20.478 --> 00:16:24.640]  And you know to accept it, because this is what's supposed to happen, because your whole life you saw this.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.401]  See, what's scary is the unknown.
[00:16:27.681 --> 00:16:31.543]  That's why they use a virus that you can't tell where it is or who's gonna get it.
[00:16:32.183 --> 00:16:43.247]  But if you've seen something really scary, like a robot riding around killing people, but you didn't respond, you sat there in the comfort of your home eating pizza or popcorn, your mind associates it with not really being a threat.
[00:16:43.267 --> 00:16:45.808]  Let me give you an example of this.
[00:16:46.169 --> 00:16:48.730]  Before the US invaded Panama in the late 80s,
[00:16:49.997 --> 00:16:52.481]  This was declassified about 20 years ago.
[00:16:53.663 --> 00:17:03.560]  They had the US Army and Marines land helicopters, throw flashbangs out, and do live fire exercises for six months before, so that when they actually attacked, folks thought it was a drill again.
[00:17:06.843 --> 00:17:10.205]  And so, see, that's what this is with the robots and the checkpoints and all of it.
[00:17:10.485 --> 00:17:12.926]  It's just getting the police, the military, everybody ready.
[00:17:13.206 --> 00:17:15.628]  And then the final phase is replacing humans.
[00:17:15.648 --> 00:17:17.809]  Because, see, humans could spread disease in the future.
[00:17:18.249 --> 00:17:20.070]  So soldiers aren't going to be able to go out and fight.
[00:17:20.470 --> 00:17:25.433]  They're going to sit back like with the Predator drones, but with ground robots, like a video game, and run those.
[00:17:25.733 --> 00:17:30.375]  And then now they're already becoming autonomous, meaning the globalists just program them and humans aren't needed.
[00:17:30.396 --> 00:17:32.837]  Because what the globalists really fear is fighting men
[00:17:33.317 --> 00:17:40.003]  And fighting women in the future when they're doing the final mop-up of humanity and folks finally figure out it was a total exterminism plan.
[00:17:40.423 --> 00:17:43.206]  A lot of people are going to go, wait a minute, you're going to bring us down to 500 million?
[00:17:43.486 --> 00:17:44.227]  I don't believe that.
[00:17:44.527 --> 00:17:54.315]  The deeper plans are going to bring it down to about a million people and then those people have to merge with silicon and become this new super being according to what the globalists admit they want to do.
[00:17:54.375 --> 00:17:55.096]  That's the real plan.
[00:17:55.116 --> 00:17:56.817]  And you're going to go, wait a minute, I don't believe this.
[00:17:56.837 --> 00:17:57.938]  This is a satanic plan.
[00:17:58.259 --> 00:17:59.300]  I don't want to kill everybody.
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:00.581]  When you've already killed, you know,
[00:18:01.241 --> 00:18:02.281]  8 or 9 billion at that point.
[00:18:02.561 --> 00:18:05.923]  The population will be about 8 or 9 billion when they run their full extermination.
[00:18:06.883 --> 00:18:08.023]  You know, the mass plant.
[00:18:09.003 --> 00:18:16.646]  So, you have to understand that you need to do that now.
[00:18:17.146 --> 00:18:20.047]  The military, the police, all of us need to say we're pro-human.
[00:18:21.247 --> 00:18:27.069]  We know this is an anti-human rollout that's happening and we're not going to go along with this.
[00:18:30.506 --> 00:18:32.107]  Because it's now out in the open.
[00:18:32.127 --> 00:18:35.110]  But see, a lot of people in the intelligentsia, they know this.
[00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:37.632]  They were recruited into this in college.
[00:18:38.552 --> 00:18:39.133]  Or high school.
[00:18:39.693 --> 00:18:41.455]  And they're in this eugenics cult.
[00:18:41.795 --> 00:18:54.525]  When Bill Gates, 10 years ago, got up in front of TED Talks, and he said, we need to bring down the number of one of these groups to zero to save the Earth because carbon dioxide is a deadly poison, which is totally false.
[00:18:54.786 --> 00:18:55.586]  It's a life-giving gas.
[00:18:56.087 --> 00:18:59.429]  But if you label something life-giving as bad, well, you can label what's putting it out as bad.
[00:18:59.910 --> 00:19:00.190]  Humans.
[00:19:02.093 --> 00:19:04.515]  And have control over everything because you're stopping something bad.
[00:19:06.678 --> 00:19:08.900]  It's like saying oxygen is fentanyl.
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.041]  Well, we better ban it.
[00:19:11.022 --> 00:19:12.564]  Now it gives you jurisdiction over everything.
[00:19:14.245 --> 00:19:17.529]  And he said to this whole big science group, so here's my equation.
[00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:23.195]  And he had humans down to zero to save the earth and everyone laughed because
[00:19:24.622 --> 00:19:26.263]  They teach life and death to doctors.
[00:19:27.003 --> 00:19:28.084]  They teach bioethics.
[00:19:28.244 --> 00:19:32.246]  And they've now taught doctors nationwide in the last 40 years.
[00:19:32.747 --> 00:19:34.768]  No longer is there a Hippocratic Oath of Hippocrates.
[00:19:36.269 --> 00:19:38.210]  Now they teach them, we're gonna have to triage life.
[00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:40.731]  We're gonna have to get rid of the old people to take care of the young people.
[00:19:40.751 --> 00:19:45.374]  No, you just build a bigger economy and higher scale and that makes it a richer, better economy, a loving economy.
[00:19:45.514 --> 00:19:46.174]  That's actually true.
[00:19:46.355 --> 00:19:52.078]  But they teach you that it's a zero-sum game, not a non-zero-sum game and the pizza's only so big, you don't grow the pie.
[00:19:53.635 --> 00:20:09.920]  And so once you get people in that predatory view, that we've got to get rid of humans, there's too many people, people are lazy, they're dumb, they're stupid, which is happening, because they're helping put flora in the water, GMO, vaccines that cause brain damage, TV designed to make the attention span very short.
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:10.921]  Globalists all admit this.
[00:20:11.321 --> 00:20:17.783]  So they make us dumb, grease the skids for our fall, and then say, oh look, they're a bunch of scum, we've got to get rid of them.
[00:20:19.264 --> 00:20:34.214]  And then the public's so dumbed down, so evil, so satanic, that the good people, here's the final trick, that are left, actually join with the world government in the final phases to save themselves from the bioweapons being released by who knows?
[00:20:35.375 --> 00:20:37.277]  The globalists are the good guys, they're the saviors, remember?
[00:20:37.757 --> 00:20:40.639]  They're not behind it, even though they publicly are, they get caught all the time.
[00:20:42.213 --> 00:20:44.734]  They tell you they want to reduce your population, but now they're the savior.
[00:20:44.874 --> 00:20:47.955]  They tell you, let's kill the old people, but now Bill Gates loves the old people.
[00:20:48.276 --> 00:20:49.556]  See, it's all hidden in plain view.
[00:20:49.596 --> 00:20:50.536]  It's a spiritual choice.
[00:20:51.577 --> 00:20:54.518]  They have to tell you who they are, but then flip it and say, but I'm going to save you.
[00:20:54.718 --> 00:20:55.178]  Come with me.
[00:20:57.359 --> 00:20:57.980]  It's terrorism.
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:07.123]  And so then the good people, 5, 10, 15, 20 years from now, depending on how long we can hold this back, but you notice they don't care now.
[00:21:07.163 --> 00:21:08.044]  They're just rolling forward.
[00:21:08.564 --> 00:21:10.485]  They said by 2020, we're launching a world government.
[00:21:11.357 --> 00:21:12.317]  Worldwide martial law.
[00:21:13.598 --> 00:21:14.258]  Ray Kurzweil.
[00:21:14.658 --> 00:21:15.218]  Ted Turner.
[00:21:15.458 --> 00:21:16.119]  Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:21:16.139 --> 00:21:16.799]  They're all on record.
[00:21:16.819 --> 00:21:17.459]  Pull their quotes up.
[00:21:18.259 --> 00:21:19.160]  We've been showing them here on air.
[00:21:20.140 --> 00:21:22.241]  In pieces I put out last week.
[00:21:22.261 --> 00:21:23.001]  It's an endgame.
[00:21:24.822 --> 00:21:26.962]  So see, now you understand what's really going on.
[00:21:28.243 --> 00:21:33.404]  And I'll tell you, you know, I've never sold out to the Globalist.
[00:21:35.805 --> 00:21:36.626]  I've never bowed to them.
[00:21:36.646 --> 00:21:37.506]  I've never joined with them.
[00:21:39.443 --> 00:22:01.163]  My job is to get as many people as warned, so that as we go into this attempt that the Bible told us was coming, and it's so real, this post-human move against humanity by the deceiver, he becomes a kill, steal, and destroy, that we don't have to go down the really hardcore trajectory that they've got planned.
[00:22:01.543 --> 00:22:05.867]  This is a choose-your-own-adventure situation.
[00:22:08.533 --> 00:22:19.840]  And then I've got to make sure my soul's clear on this, and I've got to be willing to be persecuted and taken out to be able to warn people, or I haven't done my job and I haven't been a man.
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:21.261]  This is not some heroic thing I'm doing.
[00:22:21.281 --> 00:22:23.962]  This is just the right decision to not join with Satan.
[00:22:25.483 --> 00:22:26.944]  That's why people say, oh, thank you so much.
[00:22:27.024 --> 00:22:27.924]  Oh, this is so great.
[00:22:28.285 --> 00:22:29.666]  We really appreciate you doing this.
[00:22:32.227 --> 00:22:33.688]  Something, this evil's taking over.
[00:22:35.749 --> 00:22:42.072]  And we know it, and it's all confirmed now, and then we're supposed to think it's heroic to say no to it?
[00:22:42.973 --> 00:22:44.994]  You are an electrochemical creature.
[00:22:45.014 --> 00:22:55.660]  Look at all these medical doctors coming out that were atheists before, but now that they're scanning the body, they're learning how it works, they're learning how dark matter works, they're learning the equations show other dimensions holding this one in place.
[00:22:59.062 --> 00:23:01.523]  They're actually mapping other dimensions beyond this one.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:12.365]  And they're saying, no, our cells are a manifestation of our consciousness, and that we are the electrochemical activity between those cells.
[00:23:14.667 --> 00:23:23.332]  And it's bombarding our cells with artificial systems that are manipulating our electromagnetic algorithms.
[00:23:24.613 --> 00:23:29.336]  But simply by going out and getting in the sun, you can reset it.
[00:23:31.121 --> 00:23:34.142]  That's why there's big moves in the Globalist White Papers.
[00:23:35.082 --> 00:23:43.366]  Obama's chief strategist said they wanted to make it illegal to say that you need sun for vitamin D and that all sunbathing should be banned.
[00:23:43.846 --> 00:23:57.551]  I remember reading that like in the Washington Post 10 years ago and they were sitting with a straight face that they say ban families in official books, official textbooks at the
[00:23:58.795 --> 00:24:00.797]  Doctorate level for social workers.
[00:24:01.617 --> 00:24:02.838]  I've shown these to you.
[00:24:02.918 --> 00:24:07.302]  University of Texas teaches the family is archaic and barbaric and must be outlawed.
[00:24:08.323 --> 00:24:10.244]  Babies must not be held by their parents.
[00:24:10.525 --> 00:24:11.826]  They must be kept in cribs.
[00:24:12.006 --> 00:24:14.348]  They have 30-40% IQ reductions.
[00:24:14.648 --> 00:24:17.951]  Totally screwed up if you're not held up against your mother in the first year and a half.
[00:24:19.315 --> 00:24:20.976]  Babies should be sleeping with their parents.
[00:24:21.216 --> 00:24:22.777]  Babies should be up against your skin.
[00:24:23.137 --> 00:24:24.458]  It absolutely boosts them.
[00:24:24.498 --> 00:24:25.219]  It's electrical.
[00:24:25.239 --> 00:24:26.159]  They need to be close to you.
[00:24:26.359 --> 00:24:27.880]  It's not just the coddling and the warmth.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:28.801]  It's electrical.
[00:24:29.061 --> 00:24:30.022]  You're electrical field.
[00:24:31.683 --> 00:24:35.665]  Babies can't even get sick in the first six months if they get mother's milk.
[00:24:35.705 --> 00:24:36.245]  That's on record.
[00:24:36.425 --> 00:24:38.026]  They don't want you knowing any of this.
[00:24:38.547 --> 00:24:40.148]  Most of the births are now cesarean.
[00:24:40.628 --> 00:24:41.849]  The diving boards are gone.
[00:24:42.129 --> 00:24:43.670]  Dodgeball's been banned for 20 years.
[00:24:44.430 --> 00:24:45.671]  We're being put into bubbles.
[00:24:45.811 --> 00:24:48.513]  And now we'll be forcing our homes to work from home
[00:24:49.813 --> 00:24:56.595]  Not just for controlling our movements, but then bombarding us and forcing us into virtual reality systems.
[00:24:59.736 --> 00:25:01.977]  Humanity doesn't want to give up, it's humanity.
[00:25:03.137 --> 00:25:09.379]  And so we're being forced out of our humanity into digital cages, into digital reservations.
[00:25:09.839 --> 00:25:18.562]  And if you think the Iron Horse showing up for the Midwestern and Western Native Americans was the end of their world,
[00:25:20.578 --> 00:25:29.968]  This is the end of humanity period and we better not do a ghost dance and go out and dance around a pole hoping our ancestors come back to save us.
[00:25:30.188 --> 00:25:38.597]  And that was archetypally them reaching back to their ancestors and their humanity and their strength and begging for them to give them the instincts to defeat it.
[00:25:40.499 --> 00:25:43.062]  But they didn't have it and they also did not have
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:53.424]  A transmission, and the big guy getting into a human body, and you see it from a science fiction perspective, it's amazing, isn't it?
[00:25:53.544 --> 00:26:01.928]  Jacking in, coming down here, experiencing it, warning people, and then John the Revelator lays it all out.
[00:26:02.048 --> 00:26:12.493]  World government, mark to buy and sell, giant metal ships flying around, dropping bombs, explosions as big as mountains, billions dying, the ocean dying.
[00:26:15.862 --> 00:26:17.204]  Part of the moon gets blown up?
[00:26:17.784 --> 00:26:18.946]  Oh, it's going to get bad, folks.
[00:26:21.529 --> 00:26:25.033]  Because by the end of this, humans are going to figure out it's an AI takeover.
[00:26:25.053 --> 00:26:26.795]  There's going to be a huge AI war.
[00:26:27.255 --> 00:26:28.136]  Billions are going to die.
[00:26:28.857 --> 00:26:30.279]  There's going to be bio-plagues.
[00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:34.263]  Gates and all these globalists are going to be burrowed down in their underground bunkers.
[00:26:34.784 --> 00:26:36.526]  I mean, you're going to see everything.
[00:26:39.039 --> 00:26:43.845]  And they're going to have trucks rolling by with drones going, just take your pills, just take your pills.
[00:26:44.165 --> 00:26:52.736]  And they'll drop by and say, if you simply opt out and transition now, die, we will take care of your children.
[00:26:53.376 --> 00:26:55.179]  It's all going to be just phased, phased, phased.
[00:26:55.399 --> 00:26:56.660]  Resources are not enough.
[00:26:57.181 --> 00:26:58.503]  Please, please.
[00:27:00.503 --> 00:27:00.663]  I don't
[00:27:20.097 --> 00:27:22.879]  It's not like some psychic thing, though there's that, all of us have that.
[00:27:22.979 --> 00:27:28.642]  It's that I've already read everything they've done, and how they're proposing it, and now how they're rolling it out.
[00:27:28.722 --> 00:27:35.266]  Washington State's already said they're using dead people for fertilizer on crops, and now they want to make it the law that you have to be put on crops.
[00:27:38.787 --> 00:27:39.088]  You see?
[00:27:40.609 --> 00:27:43.510]  So it's a total revolution against everything.
[00:27:43.770 --> 00:27:46.512]  We're gonna get Dr. Francis Boyle on here, go through all the news.
[00:27:48.203 --> 00:27:50.545]  Henry Kissinger saying world government is here.
[00:27:52.646 --> 00:27:55.068]  You've got to stay in your house but the borders will stay wide open.
[00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:05.175]  But first I want to play some of these clips because Fauci came out on Monday and since he said this, he goes, I've talked to the other global leaders in health.
[00:28:06.176 --> 00:28:09.478]  We're not going to relax this till no one's dying and there's no new infections.
[00:28:11.837 --> 00:28:16.640]  Well, this is the cold virus that has been weaponized.
[00:28:17.261 --> 00:28:18.481]  It is a deadly cold.
[00:28:18.922 --> 00:28:19.822]  It has been manipulated.
[00:28:22.364 --> 00:28:24.705]  It appears to mutate and be more deadly in some areas.
[00:28:28.848 --> 00:28:31.930]  And most viruses target children because their immune system hasn't stabilized yet.
[00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:32.551]  This one doesn't.
[00:28:33.011 --> 00:28:35.212]  It targets men and old people.
[00:28:36.733 --> 00:28:37.534]  It eats your testicles.
[00:28:38.435 --> 00:28:38.915]  It's designed
[00:28:40.452 --> 00:28:40.952]  Of course it does.
[00:28:41.112 --> 00:28:41.973]  They want to reduce population.
[00:28:43.133 --> 00:28:49.857]  And the idea that they've got a vaccine when no vaccine for a cold bug's ever been done because it mutates too much doesn't work.
[00:28:50.057 --> 00:28:50.657]  Just like the flu.
[00:28:50.677 --> 00:28:52.398]  They admit that.
[00:28:52.658 --> 00:28:57.041]  They never create one that then by the time it's mutated it works because it's totally different.
[00:28:58.143 --> 00:28:59.604]  So what's in that vaccine?
[00:29:00.144 --> 00:29:06.949]  This is going to be about you don't leave your house, you don't have the app to be able to travel unless you've been vaccinated.
[00:29:07.149 --> 00:29:09.310]  And you notice eight weeks ago I said they'll have apps.
[00:29:10.411 --> 00:29:13.733]  They'll say first it's a holiday for two weeks, now it's a month, now it's three months.
[00:29:14.033 --> 00:29:18.736]  They're just getting you with the handcuffs on like Ted Bundy.
[00:29:18.756 --> 00:29:21.818]  Remember he had the yellow Volkswagen, non-threatening, you get teenage girls in the car with him.
[00:29:22.824 --> 00:29:25.144]  And he'd pull a gun on him and say, look, just put the handcuffs on him and be nice.
[00:29:25.545 --> 00:29:29.025]  You put them on, he goes, just be quiet while I drive you to this place and I'm going to let you go.
[00:29:29.805 --> 00:29:32.686]  He'd take them down there, tie them up and rape them and torture them to death for a couple of days.
[00:29:33.446 --> 00:29:34.646]  Now, that's the same thing here.
[00:29:35.107 --> 00:29:41.088]  They're just getting everybody to do this and everybody to accept it and to put the handcuffs on and they're never going off.
[00:29:41.108 --> 00:29:46.529]  They're going to lead you down into a globalist New World Order basement and they're going to rape the hell out of you.
[00:29:47.708 --> 00:29:50.289]  Your money, your future, your health, your children, everything.
[00:29:50.329 --> 00:29:51.049]  It's all over.
[00:29:51.869 --> 00:29:55.431]  If you get into this and if you bow to it, it doesn't mean you don't protect yourself from the virus.
[00:29:55.671 --> 00:29:57.211]  Notice, they don't want you to know about zinc.
[00:29:57.511 --> 00:30:00.773]  They don't want you to know about vitamin D3.
[00:30:00.793 --> 00:30:03.774]  They don't want you to know about vitamin C. They don't want you to know about chloroquine.
[00:30:03.994 --> 00:30:07.355]  They don't want you to know about any of this.
[00:30:07.435 --> 00:30:09.195]  They want you helpless and desperate.
[00:30:09.375 --> 00:30:10.456]  They don't want mother's milk.
[00:30:10.816 --> 00:30:12.116]  They don't want vaginal birth.
[00:30:12.377 --> 00:30:14.517]  They don't want contact sports.
[00:30:14.577 --> 00:30:16.338]  They want domesticated slaves.
[00:30:17.708 --> 00:30:18.909]  That they can enslave.
[00:30:19.730 --> 00:30:21.851]  And they send you messages, news for you!
[00:30:21.871 --> 00:30:25.614]  Off of where you surf, and what you do, and what it's listening to you doing.
[00:30:26.915 --> 00:30:27.435]  And look it up!
[00:30:29.116 --> 00:30:30.477]  They're on right- bring it on over, dude, thank you.
[00:30:30.938 --> 00:30:32.399]  Look it on up for yourself, folks.
[00:30:32.839 --> 00:30:38.744]  All these companies admit that they're turning on the web cameras, and they're turning on the audio, and they're getting everything on you.
[00:30:41.666 --> 00:30:42.086]  Report!
[00:30:42.126 --> 00:30:45.048]  Scientists fear rushing coronavirus vaccine could make disease worse.
[00:30:45.208 --> 00:30:45.749]  Oh, think so?
[00:30:47.264 --> 00:30:48.605]  Coronavirus, Australian update.
[00:30:48.645 --> 00:30:50.447]  PM says vaccine is key to easing restrictions.
[00:30:50.467 --> 00:30:51.468]  Gotta take that shot first.
[00:30:51.488 --> 00:30:54.531]  Coronavirus expert says virus could have leaked from Wuhan lab.
[00:30:57.794 --> 00:30:59.256]  So we'll get our guest on here in a moment.
[00:30:59.356 --> 00:31:01.118]  Let's go ahead and start getting Dr. Boyle on.
[00:31:01.378 --> 00:31:02.459]  But let's go to a clip.
[00:31:04.352 --> 00:31:09.136]  of this giant globalist terrorization campaign to bring in their next phase of control.
[00:31:09.196 --> 00:31:09.716]  Just boom!
[00:31:09.756 --> 00:31:10.357]  Suddenly it's there.
[00:31:10.537 --> 00:31:10.877]  Drones.
[00:31:11.137 --> 00:31:11.518]  Robots.
[00:31:11.978 --> 00:31:12.178]  5G.
[00:31:12.398 --> 00:31:12.679]  All of it.
[00:31:13.059 --> 00:31:16.242]  And oh, all of a sudden they're announcing, you know, more 5G went in than we'd said.
[00:31:16.702 --> 00:31:18.443]  It's suddenly turning on in all the big cities.
[00:31:20.225 --> 00:31:22.427]  You're not allowed to leave your house and no complain or protest about it.
[00:31:23.627 --> 00:31:26.069]  People said, I see them installing 5G at my school.
[00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:28.211]  They go over and ask the cops, go get out of here.
[00:31:28.231 --> 00:31:29.112]  You're not allowed to be out.
[00:31:30.711 --> 00:31:36.956]  We went and checked, damn right they're putting it in that school and almost every other one.
[00:31:36.996 --> 00:31:43.961]  Our 18 wheelers are all over the place with 5G pallets and they're just putting them up all over with cameras and microphones to watch you as well.
[00:31:46.183 --> 00:31:47.784]  Yeah, let's zoom out and show folks Austin.
[00:31:49.645 --> 00:31:53.108]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen, there you go.
[00:31:53.128 --> 00:31:54.449]  Isn't that nice?
[00:31:54.529 --> 00:31:56.730]  All the red areas have 5G, everything else has 4G.
[00:31:59.411 --> 00:32:01.452]  And the purple's where they're putting in 6G.
[00:32:01.932 --> 00:32:02.693]  Oh, you didn't know that?
[00:32:02.913 --> 00:32:03.293]  Oh, yeah.
[00:32:05.334 --> 00:32:07.256]  That's just AT&T, not all the other companies.
[00:32:08.736 --> 00:32:17.922]  And remember, fiber optics is hundreds of times faster and just as good, but see, it can't surveil you like this can.
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:20.040]  Doesn't hurt you.
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:20.841]  There's no radiation.
[00:32:20.901 --> 00:32:21.982]  It's light radiation.
[00:32:22.042 --> 00:32:22.622]  Doesn't hurt you.
[00:32:22.662 --> 00:32:23.323]  All the studies show.
[00:32:23.603 --> 00:32:24.283]  Perfectly clean.
[00:32:24.524 --> 00:32:25.044]  Perfectly good.
[00:32:25.324 --> 00:32:26.805]  Instead, this just fries everything.
[00:32:27.065 --> 00:32:29.587]  And I've got stacks of news admitting that in the studies.
[00:32:30.908 --> 00:32:31.789]  But here's Fauci.
[00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:39.955]  Social distancing will continue until vaccination isn't that nice.
[00:32:40.015 --> 00:32:42.056]  And then next, Bill Gates says the same thing.
[00:32:42.316 --> 00:32:42.817]  Here's Fauci.
[00:32:44.727 --> 00:32:55.629]  Looking beyond when we're on the other side of this curve, are we looking at living with some sort of social distancing guidelines, essentially until there's treatment or a vaccine?
[00:32:55.669 --> 00:33:01.251]  For example, people looking forward to the summer talk about, you know, going to baseball games, going to concerts.
[00:33:01.311 --> 00:33:03.111]  We have political conventions over the summer.
[00:33:03.131 --> 00:33:07.412]  Are things like that possible or safe without a vaccine or a treatment in place?
[00:33:08.072 --> 00:33:11.073]  Yeah, I think if we get to the part of the curve that
[00:33:12.222 --> 00:33:24.627]  Dr. Burke showed yesterday when it goes down to essentially no new cases, no deaths at a period of time, I think it makes sense that you're going to have to relax social distancing.
[00:33:25.007 --> 00:33:37.552]  The one thing we hopefully would have in place, and I believe we will have in place, is a much more robust system to be able to identify someone who's infected, isolate them, and then do contact tracing.
[00:33:37.812 --> 00:33:39.193]  Because if you have a really good
[00:33:39.973 --> 00:33:40.033]  I'm
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:33:59.261]  Would be a vaccine.
[00:33:59.921 --> 00:34:09.308]  In fact, I was on the weekly conference call with the WHO sponsored group of all the health leaders in the world who are dealing with this.
[00:34:09.848 --> 00:34:14.411]  And we all came to the agreement that we may have cycling with another season.
[00:34:14.872 --> 00:34:16.233]  We'll be much better prepared.
[00:34:16.293 --> 00:34:17.934]  We likely will have interventions.
[00:34:18.494 --> 00:34:27.621]  But the ultimate game changer in this will be a vaccine, the same way a vaccine for other diseases that were scourges in the past that now we don't even worry about.
[00:34:29.505 --> 00:34:30.745]  Oh yeah, we don't worry about polio.
[00:34:30.765 --> 00:34:34.246]  There's just all this polio-like disease that happens after the vaccination.
[00:34:34.906 --> 00:34:36.107]  The huge history of the U.S.
[00:34:36.147 --> 00:34:39.468]  government and others in secret biological testing on populations.
[00:34:40.308 --> 00:34:44.189]  And now, these people that have been involved in these programs like Fauci up to his eyeballs.
[00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:46.910]  They've got a vaccine for us, don't you know?
[00:34:47.310 --> 00:34:50.331]  Bill and Melinda Gates already have a bunch of patents on coronavirus.
[00:34:52.371 --> 00:34:56.152]  Ingredients of the vaccine, the special live virus that they've engineered.
[00:34:56.832 --> 00:34:58.493]  But they want you to beg for it first.
[00:34:59.895 --> 00:35:01.896]  And then you'll take the thing you wouldn't take before.
[00:35:01.956 --> 00:35:03.857]  Here is Bill Gates.
[00:35:05.037 --> 00:35:08.039]  Who again, doesn't tell you that he pays CBS to do these interviews.
[00:35:08.059 --> 00:35:09.259]  He pays ABC News.
[00:35:09.279 --> 00:35:10.920]  He pays MSNBC.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:11.560]  Go look it up!
[00:35:11.921 --> 00:35:13.501]  You know, MS, Microsoft, NBC.
[00:35:14.242 --> 00:35:16.263]  They divested years ago, but he's still heavily invested in it.
[00:35:16.563 --> 00:35:19.664]  I mean, again, I saw that show The Good Doctor attacking an Alex Jones character.
[00:35:19.704 --> 00:35:20.965]  ABC said it's an Alex Jones character.
[00:35:22.068 --> 00:35:24.350]  And the guy takes supplements, and he's evil.
[00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:25.851]  And supplements don't help you.
[00:35:26.371 --> 00:35:26.771]  Seriously.
[00:35:27.152 --> 00:35:27.832]  Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:35:27.952 --> 00:35:28.893]  And it's an Alex Jones character.
[00:35:28.913 --> 00:35:30.754]  And I saw it, and I went and looked up the director and the producer.
[00:35:31.194 --> 00:35:33.396]  Works for Bill and Melinda Gates, and Bill and Melinda Gates paid for it.
[00:35:33.856 --> 00:35:35.597]  I saw the show Pandemic, where Bill Gates is a hero.
[00:35:35.617 --> 00:35:36.118]  Went and looked it up.
[00:35:36.358 --> 00:35:36.978]  He financed it.
[00:35:38.219 --> 00:35:39.020]  But he doesn't tell you that.
[00:35:40.921 --> 00:35:42.282]  He's the new president of the world.
[00:35:43.908 --> 00:35:52.078]  It's incredible, and here he is saying, hey, the answer, when you can be in crowds again, is you take the vaccine for the common cold that's been weaponized.
[00:35:52.118 --> 00:35:52.479]  Here it is.
[00:35:52.981 --> 00:35:53.121]  Yeah.
[00:35:53.141 --> 00:35:53.281]  Yeah.
[00:36:18.921 --> 00:36:21.025]  Oh, and he's at his house, one of his palaces.
[00:36:21.506 --> 00:36:22.668]  Everybody's at their house.
[00:36:22.748 --> 00:36:23.650]  Nobody's going out.
[00:36:24.151 --> 00:36:25.794]  Because, again, you have to stay at home.
[00:36:25.814 --> 00:36:27.336]  And we're not saying the virus doesn't kill people.
[00:36:29.090 --> 00:36:34.471]  What we are saying is that it's a giant excuse for this massive power grab, and that's what people should know about.
[00:36:34.891 --> 00:36:40.433]  Okay, I want to go to our next guest, who I appreciate coming on on short notice, Dr. Francis Boyle.
[00:36:41.013 --> 00:36:57.277]  There are now more and more microbiologists, we'll go over some of these articles and tell you who in a moment, more and more prestigious universities, the Pentagon, the State Department, and many others that are coming out now and saying that it does look like it is
[00:36:58.377 --> 00:37:03.980]  A bio weapon and that they think it leaked out of Wuhan.
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.261]  Well, you could debate that all day long.
[00:37:07.201 --> 00:37:11.203]  And that's what Dr. Boyle thinks is what the evidence points that scientifically can prove.
[00:37:11.963 --> 00:37:14.165]  They certainly used it once it got out for all of this.
[00:37:14.185 --> 00:37:17.886]  They were certainly waiting for this to happen and not letting a good crisis go to waste in China.
[00:37:17.926 --> 00:37:24.049]  Now, we do know, as Dr. Boyle said eight, nine weeks ago when he first heard it coming on, that they have certainly used this crisis.
[00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:28.794]  In China for a power grab and China didn't lie about it.
[00:37:29.055 --> 00:37:35.364]  I have a Washington Post article that I'll show you later in this interview with Dr. Boyle that's commercial free by the way on this live Saturday transmission.
[00:37:35.745 --> 00:37:39.751]  We'll re-air it over and over again until the Sunday show 4 to 6 tomorrow that I'll also be hosting.
[00:37:41.291 --> 00:37:52.515]  But in the Washington Post article, and I don't just believe the Washington Post, it has anecdotal report off of what we were reporting from Zero Hedge two weeks ago, that the urns are in the thousands a day.
[00:37:53.696 --> 00:37:59.598]  Over a thousand a day just in one city of Wuhan being videotaped, being shown, and now people going out and putting them out.
[00:37:59.618 --> 00:38:01.559]  So that's not 4,000 dead in the whole country.
[00:38:01.579 --> 00:38:02.599]  That's not 3,000 dead in Wuhan.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:06.961]  43,000 some numbers show.
[00:38:06.981 --> 00:38:09.481]  The Pentagon's now saying, yeah, they think that's accurate.
[00:38:09.761 --> 00:38:11.402]  46,000 dead in Wuhan alone.
[00:38:11.962 --> 00:38:15.283]  So we'll go through those numbers, show you those articles here with Dr. Boyle.
[00:38:15.303 --> 00:38:20.085]  But I first just wanted to get his take on the development since we had him on about five days ago.
[00:38:20.105 --> 00:38:20.885]  Thanks for coming on, doctor.
[00:38:22.525 --> 00:38:25.186]  Well, thank you very much for having me on, Alex.
[00:38:25.586 --> 00:38:31.508]  And I did want to follow up on your point about the vaccines.
[00:38:31.588 --> 00:38:34.029]  What you're saying is perfectly correct.
[00:38:35.834 --> 00:38:42.519]  Fauci, the notion here that there's going to be vaccines, that this is going to save us, is preposterous.
[00:38:42.799 --> 00:38:44.581]  It's, I think, a mirage.
[00:38:44.721 --> 00:38:46.202]  It's a boondoggle.
[00:38:47.103 --> 00:38:52.807]  And a lot of people are going to make a lot of money off of scaremongering us.
[00:38:52.967 --> 00:39:00.994]  Now, you did mention earlier at the beginning of this crisis that a patent for the PeerBrite vaccine
[00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:02.371]  A U.S.
[00:39:02.411 --> 00:39:02.731]  patent.
[00:39:02.771 --> 00:39:03.992]  I did get that patent.
[00:39:04.032 --> 00:39:05.073]  I did read through it.
[00:39:05.994 --> 00:39:14.000]  And it did seem to me that this was a typical dual-use offensive-defensive.
[00:39:14.080 --> 00:39:16.362]  No, the patent was a U.S.
[00:39:16.422 --> 00:39:19.905]  patent, Alan, that I got off the U.S.
[00:39:19.985 --> 00:39:20.945]  Patent Office.
[00:39:21.806 --> 00:39:23.247]  I'm not sure about this patent.
[00:39:23.287 --> 00:39:23.908]  I hadn't read it.
[00:39:25.009 --> 00:39:26.410]  But in any event, the
[00:39:27.182 --> 00:39:35.724]  The patent by Peerbrite, by the way, Peerbrite is a British biowarfare operation there.
[00:39:36.385 --> 00:39:44.427]  They leaked the hoof and mouth disease weapon they were working on and it took out most of the British cattle industry.
[00:39:45.027 --> 00:39:48.108]  In any event, I read that Peer Brite coronavirus.
[00:39:48.168 --> 00:39:50.169]  And by the way, I left that in there on my desk.
[00:39:50.249 --> 00:39:51.409]  I'm gonna see if they can go grab it.
[00:39:51.569 --> 00:39:52.090]  But you're right.
[00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:53.910]  I actually have the patent printed off as well.
[00:39:54.210 --> 00:39:56.051]  And they tried to spin it and say, oh, it's for chickens.
[00:39:56.451 --> 00:39:58.472]  But it says in there, also for humans.
[00:39:59.512 --> 00:40:00.153]  That's correct.
[00:40:00.293 --> 00:40:02.173]  And I did read through it very carefully.
[00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:07.435]  It is clearly anti-human, the U.S.
[00:40:07.495 --> 00:40:07.815]  patent.
[00:40:07.855 --> 00:40:09.296]  I haven't read the European patent.
[00:40:10.756 --> 00:40:12.297]  Offensive, defensive.
[00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:28.119]  Where they develop the weapon for the offensive agent first, then they develop the vaccine second, and then they have a weapon that they can use, thinking that the vaccine will save them in the event of blowback.
[00:40:28.619 --> 00:40:41.407]  The problem with that patent, as I see it, Alex, yes, it is for a coronavirus weapon, but I don't really know or think it's going to help us with COVID.
[00:40:42.196 --> 00:40:51.476]  Because COVID is far beyond more dangerous and more lethal than I think anything they were working with there on
[00:40:52.593 --> 00:41:00.680]  Peerbrite, and I've already gone through with you in detail that University of North Carolina article.
[00:41:01.321 --> 00:41:06.105]  I'm not going to go through it again here, but you can just see how dangerous that is.
[00:41:06.705 --> 00:41:07.866]  Gain of function.
[00:41:08.047 --> 00:41:09.928]  It's got HIV in there.
[00:41:10.889 --> 00:41:12.330]  Fort Detrick was involved.
[00:41:13.211 --> 00:41:17.715]  University of Texas Medical Branch up to their eyeballs in biological warfare work.
[00:41:18.394 --> 00:41:25.877]  So, I'm really not sure if that Peerbrite vaccine is going to help anyone here.
[00:41:26.797 --> 00:41:44.903]  Indeed, what is interesting, after University of North Carolina developed, DNA genetically engineered, this Wuhan coronavirus, I believe, that we're dealing with, they didn't turn to a vaccine.
[00:41:46.476 --> 00:41:50.999]  I think because they concluded there was no effective vaccine for this darn thing.
[00:41:51.619 --> 00:42:03.128]  And so what they turned to at UNC, this is in the public record, was a therapeutic Remdesivir, which they were investigating.
[00:42:04.063 --> 00:42:08.205]  I can't guarantee Remdesivir is going to help us on COVID, too.
[00:42:09.046 --> 00:42:11.787]  But this notion of a vaccine, you're perfectly right.
[00:42:12.327 --> 00:42:21.832]  They're going to be injecting live COVID into us and charging a fortune and probably giving us all COVID.
[00:42:21.892 --> 00:42:22.512]  We don't know.
[00:42:22.892 --> 00:42:30.176]  This is exactly what happened in the Black West African Ebola pandemic.
[00:42:30.716 --> 00:42:32.437]  That all came out of
[00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:48.525]  That BSL-4 facility set up by USAID, which is a front organization for the CIA, Fort Detrick, our biowarfare headquarters, Tulane University,
[00:42:49.365 --> 00:42:55.446]  And my disalma mater, the Harvard-MIT Broad Institute.
[00:42:55.946 --> 00:43:00.527]  And we know that Fort Detrick had weaponized Ebola.
[00:43:00.987 --> 00:43:02.707]  They had aerosolized it.
[00:43:02.848 --> 00:43:11.309]  Indeed, aerosolization is always a tip-off of a biological weapon because it's delivered by air to human beings.
[00:43:11.469 --> 00:43:12.149]  We breathe it.
[00:43:12.729 --> 00:43:16.150]  So, as best as I can figure out what was going on there,
[00:43:17.971 --> 00:43:27.459]  In the Sierra Leone lab, they were testing out an experimental Ebola vaccine that was giving people live Ebola.
[00:43:28.209 --> 00:43:32.493]  And that's where that came from, and close to 13,000 people died.
[00:43:32.673 --> 00:43:33.314]  Absolutely.
[00:43:33.414 --> 00:43:36.777]  I want to go over some of the big microbiologists and others that are coming out and agreeing with you.
[00:43:36.897 --> 00:43:43.422]  Also, the Indian Institute that was basically ordered to withdraw, you know, eight weeks ago, saying this is clearly man-made.
[00:43:43.583 --> 00:43:45.144]  Other groups came out and said, no, we scanned it.
[00:43:45.264 --> 00:43:46.045]  It clearly is as well.
[00:43:46.065 --> 00:43:47.406]  They never said their study was wrong.
[00:43:47.426 --> 00:43:52.430]  They just withdrew it because of international threats by the WHO, who's been lockstep with China.
[00:43:52.470 --> 00:43:52.831]  So I want to
[00:43:53.231 --> 00:43:53.471]  I think?
[00:44:12.501 --> 00:44:22.490]  I noticed they just brought the Chinese into the UN World Human Rights Group when, again, I don't think anybody's got a worse record of human rights, even Hitler, than the Communist Chinese.
[00:44:22.530 --> 00:44:23.931]  I mean, this is just incredible.
[00:44:24.272 --> 00:44:33.420]  Now confirm mainstream reports, we're going to get to after you're gone, of them confirming that China is harvesting for party members the lungs of political prisoners.
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.382]  I mean, this is so macabre.
[00:44:35.882 --> 00:44:41.464]  And again, we're in 2020, like a nightmare dystopic science fiction novel that we're now in.
[00:44:41.484 --> 00:44:44.685]  So I want to walk through all of that with you and get into any points you want to make.
[00:44:45.465 --> 00:44:49.986]  But just looking at the numbers, I saw where in the Dakotas, a state rep died at 71.
[00:44:50.487 --> 00:44:50.967]  OK.
[00:44:51.227 --> 00:44:54.028]  Then his sister died a week before, 50-something.
[00:44:54.428 --> 00:45:00.690]  And then I am seeing clusters in families dying now, some of them not 60, 70, 80 years old.
[00:45:01.390 --> 00:45:04.531]  And it seems like in some areas it's worse than others, even areas that
[00:45:05.251 --> 00:45:10.617]  Aren't big transportation hubs, and we've seen almost 4,000 dead in New York.
[00:45:10.977 --> 00:45:13.560]  I mean, clearly this, as you said eight weeks ago, okay, you're right.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.340]  Mike Adams is right.
[00:45:14.661 --> 00:45:18.244]  This is worse than a bad flu, and you were right to be scared of it.
[00:45:18.304 --> 00:45:19.526]  It's clearly man-made.
[00:45:20.547 --> 00:45:25.832]  How bad is it now that we're getting closer optics on this and a little bit clearer?
[00:45:29.522 --> 00:45:40.095]  Well, Alex, I don't mean to scare anyone, but I think we have to be realistic here in trying to figure out what happened in order to save ourselves here in America.
[00:45:40.816 --> 00:45:43.480]  I think that a British report
[00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:49.364]  That we could be facing two million deaths here in America could be right on the mark, right?
[00:45:50.165 --> 00:45:51.086]  I'm afraid so.
[00:45:51.706 --> 00:45:53.527]  As for China, yes, of course.
[00:45:54.908 --> 00:45:58.010]  As I've said before, I'm a professor of international law.
[00:45:59.091 --> 00:46:13.280]  They can have whatever system of government they want over there under international law, but why you would believe anything coming out of Chairman Xi's communist dictatorship over there is beyond me.
[00:46:13.501 --> 00:46:13.901]  It's just
[00:46:14.281 --> 00:46:15.302]  It's mystifying.
[00:46:15.722 --> 00:46:26.448]  I spent 10 years at the University of Chicago and Harvard studying the Soviet Union and passing my Ph.D.
[00:46:26.528 --> 00:46:29.529]  oral general exams in Soviet politics.
[00:46:29.629 --> 00:46:31.951]  I was qualified to teach that subject at Harvard.
[00:46:33.451 --> 00:46:36.353]  I have no illusions about communist systems of government.
[00:46:37.169 --> 00:46:45.011]  And now they're engaging in a PR campaign, making it appear that they are such humanitarians.
[00:46:45.031 --> 00:46:50.312]  They even bought off the Non-Aligned group earlier this week.
[00:46:50.592 --> 00:46:51.232]  Well, exactly.
[00:46:51.332 --> 00:46:56.894]  Twitter, Facebook, and Google push what the Chinese Central Committee says.
[00:46:58.754 --> 00:47:01.935]  They say the president's full of crap, but then they parrot it.
[00:47:02.035 --> 00:47:06.156]  It's confirmed, and give them free reign to push total disinformation.
[00:47:07.776 --> 00:47:21.260]  Well, and as a matter of fact, Alex, if you were listening to Berks, who is this cheery face of the Corona Task Force, she refers to Chinese statistics.
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:37.345]  So how can her models be any good at all if they are based on statistics coming out of China that we all know are completely bogus and we know full well China has been lying right from the get-go
[00:47:38.161 --> 00:47:41.083]  On what happened here right from the very beginning.
[00:47:41.643 --> 00:47:49.267]  So we can't trust anything coming out of China, unless it's what we law professors call an admission against interest.
[00:47:49.868 --> 00:48:04.175]  And there you had these two Chinese scientists publishing a paper at grave risk to their lives, saying we believe that COVID came out of that Wuhan BSL-4
[00:48:05.556 --> 00:48:08.578]  And as you correctly point out, even now the CIA is saying that
[00:48:28.812 --> 00:48:34.115]  Well, yeah, they could be off by a factor of anywhere from 10 times to 40 times.
[00:48:34.135 --> 00:48:47.762]  Well, the Pentagon, as you said, I just showed the Washington Post, they think 46,000, others extrapolating, and again, I'm not bragging, but I mean, we put up the Zero Hedge article, we covered this weeks ago, good job for Zero Hedge and others, noticing that the earns were
[00:48:50.107 --> 00:48:51.630]  100 to 1 what they were claiming.
[00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:54.354]  Thousands of urns every day or so.
[00:48:54.374 --> 00:48:58.701]  So what's the real number in China if it's 46,000 in Wuhan?
[00:48:58.741 --> 00:49:02.627]  If this is true, this is a very robust bioweapon.
[00:49:04.386 --> 00:49:05.106]  That's correct.
[00:49:05.186 --> 00:49:07.767]  And now the Chinese are saying, well, everything's fine.
[00:49:07.827 --> 00:49:10.549]  People are going back to work and school.
[00:49:10.629 --> 00:49:10.889]  Right.
[00:49:10.929 --> 00:49:12.630]  Because they're being forced back to work.
[00:49:12.670 --> 00:49:16.311]  But then yesterday, they said they've locked China down again, but that got no coverage.
[00:49:16.711 --> 00:49:20.673]  Literally almost no coverage that China just locked down its major cities again.
[00:49:23.376 --> 00:49:25.598]  You're absolutely right, Alex.
[00:49:25.638 --> 00:49:33.245]  That's why I appear on here with you to get a message out that contradicts the party line.
[00:49:33.465 --> 00:49:36.408]  By the way, I never wanted to panic people, and I wasn't sure of this.
[00:49:36.788 --> 00:49:37.889]  I believe the big institutes.
[00:49:37.969 --> 00:49:41.813]  I believe you, your prestigious background, a lot of integrity, that it's man-made.
[00:49:41.853 --> 00:49:42.574]  But yeah, who knows?
[00:49:42.614 --> 00:49:44.295]  It's a stimulant for a vaccine.
[00:49:44.375 --> 00:49:44.856]  Who knows?
[00:49:45.596 --> 00:49:46.797]  I'm not a doctor or an expert.
[00:49:46.857 --> 00:49:48.598]  I just read out H1N1 the year before.
[00:49:48.918 --> 00:49:53.540]  They had a simulant that was an engineered virus to track vaccination rates and herd immunity.
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.301]  And it looks like that got out of control.
[00:49:55.321 --> 00:49:56.682]  I mean, who knows if that's true or not.
[00:49:56.702 --> 00:49:57.702]  That was in the news at the time.
[00:49:58.102 --> 00:50:00.583]  These huge things are just buried in the news and they move on.
[00:50:01.044 --> 00:50:07.567]  So I was hoping that it's, I mean, it does appear to be somewhat race specific or is that incorrect?
[00:50:10.023 --> 00:50:13.485]  I have not seen evidence of that yet, Alex.
[00:50:14.045 --> 00:50:14.485]  I haven't.
[00:50:14.665 --> 00:50:24.810]  I do know that work has been done before to develop a race-specific biological warfare agent.
[00:50:24.970 --> 00:50:26.390]  I know we worked on it.
[00:50:27.271 --> 00:50:31.353]  The Afrikaner apartheid regime in South Africa worked on it.
[00:50:31.413 --> 00:50:32.673]  We cooperated with them.
[00:50:33.293 --> 00:50:34.454]  Israel has worked on it.
[00:50:35.083 --> 00:50:39.028]  But I haven't seen evidence that this is the case.
[00:50:40.209 --> 00:50:45.375]  And I'm afraid, you know, now it's all over Europe and the United States.
[00:50:45.475 --> 00:50:49.820]  We're not of Asian genetic descent, most of us.
[00:50:50.701 --> 00:50:57.127]  I'm afraid it's going to take off like a hot knife through butter in Africa and India.
[00:50:57.307 --> 00:50:58.608]  It's already starting in India.
[00:50:58.628 --> 00:51:02.591]  So, again, I haven't seen that evidence, Alex.
[00:51:02.751 --> 00:51:19.285]  And indeed, Alex, as we discussed before, the PNACers in that PNAC report, the neocons under Bolton and Wolfowitz... They said, we're going to legitimize the use of race-specific bioweapons using the media.
[00:51:20.526 --> 00:51:21.226]  That's correct.
[00:51:21.386 --> 00:51:22.687]  That's exactly what it said.
[00:51:22.707 --> 00:51:23.207]  That's crazy.
[00:51:23.247 --> 00:51:24.408]  Legitimize race weapons.
[00:51:25.648 --> 00:51:26.128]  That's right.
[00:51:26.248 --> 00:51:29.790]  And then they went into power under Bush Jr.
[00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:34.751]  and I suspect ordered their people to start working on it.
[00:51:35.172 --> 00:51:40.774]  But I have not seen evidence that COVID is it because it's affecting everyone.
[00:51:40.834 --> 00:51:43.755]  Now look what's happening there in Italy.
[00:51:43.795 --> 00:51:45.296]  They're reporting a over 12%
[00:51:47.054 --> 00:51:49.878]  Lethality rate, and we know that's an underestimate.
[00:51:49.998 --> 00:51:56.888]  Even the New York Times says... By the way, I mean, folks, 12% death rate, that's like end-of-the-world-level crap, if that's true.
[00:51:58.866 --> 00:52:00.627]  I think that's an underestimate, Alex.
[00:52:01.007 --> 00:52:10.753]  I think even the New York Times, which is, you know, the mouth of the New World Order between you and me, they said... Well, this is true.
[00:52:10.813 --> 00:52:12.875]  I'm about to get in a damn hazmat outfit.
[00:52:15.396 --> 00:52:15.836]  Wow, this is crazy.
[00:52:15.856 --> 00:52:16.977]  Well, I don't know, Alex.
[00:52:17.477 --> 00:52:26.643]  Again, you have to understand that that BSL-4 facility where they were manufacturing COVID
[00:52:27.609 --> 00:52:29.331]  They all worked in moon suits.
[00:52:29.951 --> 00:52:31.292]  That's how dangerous it is.
[00:52:32.153 --> 00:52:38.319]  So, I kid you not, I guess if you, you know, there could be nanotechnology in there for all we know.
[00:52:38.759 --> 00:52:48.568]  That chairman of the Harvard Chemistry Department, Lieber, he's a specialist in nanotechnology.
[00:52:49.771 --> 00:53:07.937]  Now explain to people how NanoTek is very similar to the virus, where it's like a man-made type deal, that the CHICOM has infiltrated so many things, and we see all these CHICOM operatives being rolled up, being arrested, not getting a lot of attention, but huge, that's a huge development, and then magically this happens.
[00:53:08.297 --> 00:53:09.357]  Why do you bring that up?
[00:53:09.457 --> 00:53:10.258]  Do you think it's connected?
[00:53:11.958 --> 00:53:17.840]  Yes, because this Harvard chair of the chemistry department, his specialization
[00:53:18.556 --> 00:53:20.017]  was nanotechnology.
[00:53:20.597 --> 00:53:22.599]  The Chinese were paying him a lot of money.
[00:53:23.119 --> 00:53:38.749]  He even had his own laboratory over there in Wuhan, and it was reported he was working on both chemical and biological matters, which means, I take it, applying nanotechnology to chemical weapons and biological weapons.
[00:53:38.769 --> 00:53:39.229]  Unbelievable.
[00:53:39.469 --> 00:53:45.753]  We know for a fact that Amerithrax was based on nanotechnology.
[00:53:46.388 --> 00:53:51.373]  You had a trillion spores per gram.
[00:53:52.796 --> 00:53:57.019]  The only way that could have been done is nanotechnology.
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:03.063]  It could float through the air because the particles were so small it traveled on the air.
[00:54:03.544 --> 00:54:15.351]  Now you have this MIT scientist study earlier this week saying from her experiment COVID could travel 27 feet.
[00:54:15.371 --> 00:54:16.432]  How would it be able to do that?
[00:54:19.873 --> 00:54:20.934]  Nanotechnology.
[00:54:21.074 --> 00:54:22.495]  It's lighter than the air.
[00:54:22.615 --> 00:54:24.456]  It travels on air currents.
[00:54:24.676 --> 00:54:24.956]  Sure.
[00:54:25.437 --> 00:54:33.562]  So I think we need a thorough investigation of what this Harvard chemistry chair was doing over there.
[00:54:33.982 --> 00:54:37.565]  And the notion that Harvard didn't know what he was doing is preposterous.
[00:54:37.805 --> 00:54:38.145]  I spent
[00:54:38.665 --> 00:54:39.766]  Seven years at Harvard.
[00:54:39.826 --> 00:54:42.987]  I have three degrees there, two years teaching at Harvard College.
[00:54:43.307 --> 00:54:46.989]  Of course Harvard knew what the chair of its chemistry department was.
[00:54:47.069 --> 00:54:47.890]  And as you mentioned, G.G.
[00:54:47.930 --> 00:54:49.250]  Pink's daughter goes to Harvard.
[00:54:49.290 --> 00:54:53.772]  Harvard has become really like the Legion of Doom or something.
[00:54:54.833 --> 00:54:55.033]  Right.
[00:54:55.113 --> 00:54:59.635]  So Harvard knew that this guy had his own nanotechnology over there in Wuhan.
[00:55:00.676 --> 00:55:02.937]  So, you know, that's just a cover story for something.
[00:55:03.970 --> 00:55:10.334]  So, that might account for why this was being done in a BSL-4.
[00:55:10.394 --> 00:55:18.398]  If you're going to deal with applying nanotechnology to a biological weapon, you've got to wear a moon suit.
[00:55:18.458 --> 00:55:20.139]  Dr. Boyle, the author of the U.S.
[00:55:20.159 --> 00:55:27.904]  Biological Weapons Law, a top expert, represents major presidents and world leaders at the Hague, some of the most famous cases ever, if not the most famous.
[00:55:28.624 --> 00:55:31.065]  Just look it up yourself, the whole bio, it's crazy.
[00:55:34.688 --> 00:55:48.013]  As a father of four, as a husband, as an American, I just had a deep-seated responsibility, even though we first rang the alarm that this is man-made and looks like a bioweapon, to hope the lower numbers were right.
[00:55:48.214 --> 00:55:55.396]  And I've had some virologists on, I've talked to some scientists, they say, hey, a lot of times viruses burn themselves out, sometimes they get worse.
[00:55:55.997 --> 00:56:02.639]  Now I saw two weeks ago that in Reykjavik they were saying they found 40-plus versions, now it's 100 mutations.
[00:56:02.979 --> 00:56:03.840]  They're saying in Europe,
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:25.149]  Uh, but if it's a bioweapon and things are so sophisticated now, the technology is even beyond what people that were, you know, involved in weapons 10 years ago is, where I'm told, as you said, it's almost like nanotech is merged with viruses, that they're able to edit these things together and then test with mathematics how they're going to mutate in many cases, and so
[00:56:26.169 --> 00:56:26.970]  It could get worse.
[00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:35.175]  And then you were the first to say, I mean, this is just true, eight weeks ago, that they could release other things now during this that are similar, but use this virus as the cover.
[00:56:35.195 --> 00:56:38.458]  I mean, government really does seem scared.
[00:56:39.038 --> 00:56:40.939]  There's not just a corporate power grab going on.
[00:56:40.959 --> 00:56:43.501]  That's obviously people are overlaying different missions there.
[00:56:43.541 --> 00:56:55.450]  But Kissinger saying, and I know you went to that same special office as he did, ran his office, the office he had at Harvard for a while, that this could end the world government or totally bring an end, that it's a new world order system.
[00:56:56.700 --> 00:56:59.000]  That, you know, a new dark age could be here.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.821]  The economy could be hurt for decades.
[00:57:01.921 --> 00:57:03.621]  World chaos and world order.
[00:57:04.121 --> 00:57:05.542]  Conversation with Henry Kissinger.
[00:57:06.022 --> 00:57:08.122]  Kissinger on the assembly of the new world order.
[00:57:08.502 --> 00:57:11.303]  Kissinger warns coronavirus has felt economic doom for generations.
[00:57:12.143 --> 00:57:15.463]  I mean, this is what he's put out in this report, obviously.
[00:57:15.483 --> 00:57:24.305]  I mean, this is the big one because they always said they would use an outbreak like this to bring in a worldwide authoritarian system.
[00:57:26.445 --> 00:57:39.412]  Alex, what I'm afraid we are seeing here is the implementation of the Nazi philosophy of useless eaters that was condemned by the Nuremberg Tribunal in 1946.
[00:57:39.492 --> 00:57:40.112]  Namely, you know, if
[00:57:44.588 --> 00:57:56.811]  You know, ordinary, common Americans and workers, people who work with their hands, things of this nature, blue collar workers, if they have to be sacrificed, so be it.
[00:57:57.471 --> 00:58:00.492]  If old people get killed, well, that's just great.
[00:58:00.612 --> 00:58:04.733]  It saves us on pensions and Medicare.
[00:58:05.133 --> 00:58:06.313]  I think this is the
[00:58:07.139 --> 00:58:12.442]  This Nazi philosophy of useless eaters is what we're seeing in operation today, yes.
[00:58:13.083 --> 00:58:21.027]  And as for, you're correct about the mutations, how can you have an effective vaccine with all these mutations?
[00:58:21.388 --> 00:58:22.228]  It's preposterous.
[00:58:22.368 --> 00:58:23.329]  It's not going to happen.
[00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:25.110]  It's like the flu vaccine.
[00:58:25.650 --> 00:58:28.495]  They don't know what the next flu virus is going to be.
[00:58:28.955 --> 00:58:33.983]  They just guess, and it's less than 50% effective anyway.
[00:58:34.363 --> 00:58:37.068]  And you're injecting all this garbage into your system.
[00:58:37.729 --> 00:58:41.074]  So it gets back to my point that we started out.
[00:58:41.634 --> 00:58:46.257]  Well, this vaccine is a mirage and a boondoggle.
[00:58:47.158 --> 00:58:58.967]  All these people are going to be making all this money, and then they'll say, oh, well, we have a vaccine, and all you people have to take it, whether you like it or not, and we're going to inject live coronavirus into you.
[00:58:59.187 --> 00:59:01.508]  Well, I'm afraid that's the future.
[00:59:01.548 --> 00:59:02.469]  You're right about that.
[00:59:02.529 --> 00:59:04.791]  Yes, it seems that's what's coming.
[00:59:05.526 --> 00:59:09.367]  You have a big historical grasp, but I think listeners sometimes just think I spout things off.
[00:59:09.707 --> 00:59:19.131]  For those that don't know, Sir Thomas Malthus, 250 years ago, quoted Plato and said we must get the dirty masses off the breasts of Mother Nature.
[00:59:19.591 --> 00:59:23.492]  And Plato talked about hurting, you know, the poor and or having licenses to have children.
[00:59:23.833 --> 00:59:24.713]  He started eugenics.
[00:59:25.785 --> 00:59:31.047]  And then the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute was funded by the Rockefellers on record and funded by IBM.
[00:59:31.887 --> 00:59:34.728]  Watson got an award from Hitler that Hitler didn't even get.
[00:59:34.808 --> 00:59:39.869]  They made a special award for folks that didn't know IBM basically ran the Nazi machine.
[00:59:40.329 --> 00:59:41.169]  Their computers did.
[00:59:41.189 --> 00:59:44.670]  The tattoos, they could put it in the Hall Earth machine.
[00:59:45.090 --> 00:59:48.031]  Now Bill Gates wants you to take a microchip to make sure you've been vaccinated.
[00:59:48.051 --> 00:59:53.393]  I don't think people understand that when we talk about Nazi science, Nazi technology, Hitler was a beta test.
[00:59:54.295 --> 00:59:58.096]  But then got out of control and attacked everybody because he was being so praised and everything.
[00:59:58.136 --> 01:00:02.578]  And people don't understand that when you talk about useless eaters, that's what this is.
[01:00:03.358 --> 01:00:05.959]  And Bill Gates is this big proponent of getting rid of the useless eaters.
[01:00:06.659 --> 01:00:08.560]  And then, but suddenly he cares about the old people.
[01:00:08.940 --> 01:00:16.163]  That's what I'm seeing here is Bill Gates says we shouldn't give old people, you know, end of life medical care and we should do all this to hire 10 teachers, death panels.
[01:00:16.443 --> 01:00:18.223]  But now he really cares about old people.
[01:00:18.544 --> 01:00:20.384]  And China has a big problem with old people.
[01:00:20.684 --> 01:00:22.145]  They don't want to pay their pensions either.
[01:00:22.905 --> 01:00:26.549]  And so, this was obviously being developed and cooked up for this moment.
[01:00:27.250 --> 01:00:30.294]  And of course, you make something highly communicable in a place with moon suits, you're right!
[01:00:30.634 --> 01:00:31.996]  These places are always leaking!
[01:00:32.456 --> 01:00:33.477]  Or is that the cover?
[01:00:34.038 --> 01:00:38.984]  Is it that, oh, these things keep leaking, so we think they leaked again, or they always tell us they leaked?
[01:00:39.644 --> 01:00:40.125]  Good doctor.
[01:00:42.574 --> 01:00:52.103]  Well, as I said in that award-winning documentary, Anthrax Wars, quite some time ago, all these BSL-3s and these BSL-4s leak.
[01:00:55.481 --> 01:01:03.165]  Everyone knows it, and I said, this is a catastrophe waiting to happen, and it has now happened.
[01:01:03.485 --> 01:01:04.426]  It's confronting us.
[01:01:05.967 --> 01:01:13.310]  I think the estimate given by Berks of 100,000 to 200,000 dead is just preposterous.
[01:01:14.211 --> 01:01:16.232]  We're facing at least Italy at 12,000.
[01:01:16.332 --> 01:01:20.474]  Twelve percent over there is a gross underestimate.
[01:01:21.401 --> 01:01:24.243]  And again, please understand, I'm not here to scare anyone.
[01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:30.128]  I'm just saying we have to be very realistic here in what confronts us.
[01:01:30.788 --> 01:01:35.232]  Hey listen, I respect you and I respect Mike Adams and you guys have been pretty much saying the same thing.
[01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:39.655]  I just am having trouble, I guess one of the stages of things is denial.
[01:01:40.075 --> 01:01:45.139]  I'm having trouble confronting this mentally because this is pissing me off.
[01:01:47.898 --> 01:01:48.378]  That's right.
[01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:52.220]  That's Elizabeth Kubler-Ross, the stages of dying.
[01:01:53.161 --> 01:01:55.282]  And the first stage there is denial.
[01:01:55.422 --> 01:02:03.526]  And I'm afraid that's what we're seeing by Birx and Redfield and Azar and the Surgeon General.
[01:02:03.626 --> 01:02:04.866]  Indeed, I think it's worse.
[01:02:04.946 --> 01:02:06.367]  I think they're just covering it up.
[01:02:07.688 --> 01:02:10.129]  And, you know, unfortunately,
[01:02:11.090 --> 01:02:15.492]  The American people are trusting what they are being said.
[01:02:15.872 --> 01:02:24.516]  Again, notice Berks earlier this week is still saying six feet is the proper social distancing.
[01:02:24.956 --> 01:02:26.196]  Well, that's going to get you killed.
[01:02:26.957 --> 01:02:30.278]  That MIT, I've always been saying it has a gain of function.
[01:02:30.718 --> 01:02:34.140]  So you need at least a buckle back.
[01:02:34.700 --> 01:02:36.682]  Not the MIT study.
[01:02:37.623 --> 01:02:39.324]  It's saying it's 27 feet.
[01:02:39.685 --> 01:02:42.968]  I don't know, but that could be a possibility.
[01:02:42.988 --> 01:02:46.611]  You know, Alex, it really disturbed me today.
[01:02:47.512 --> 01:02:53.477]  They had pictures from the Javits Center in New York, OK, from the inside.
[01:02:54.264 --> 01:03:09.985]  And there were our troops lined up in the Javits Center where they're going to bring in COVID patients and our troops are not wearing masks and they are not maintaining any social distancing at all.
[01:03:10.165 --> 01:03:18.275]  By the way, that's what I've seen in the news is that nurses are asking at all these hospitals why they're not being given masks and told to wear them all the time.
[01:03:18.295 --> 01:03:19.877]  So I'm supposed to stay in my house.
[01:03:20.017 --> 01:03:22.040]  I'm supposed to wear a mask when I go out.
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.883]  I mean, I was out at a golf course by my neighborhood.
[01:03:25.524 --> 01:03:25.884]  Okay.
[01:03:26.545 --> 01:03:28.266]  And there was almost no one out there.
[01:03:28.286 --> 01:03:30.107]  And I talked to one lady today.
[01:03:30.127 --> 01:03:33.388]  She said, yeah, she said a lady came out and told her you shouldn't be out here.
[01:03:33.849 --> 01:03:35.570]  Out in a golf course, no one is around.
[01:03:35.590 --> 01:03:37.130]  Like you might see one person every 10 minutes.
[01:03:37.511 --> 01:03:38.411]  How is that bad?
[01:03:38.471 --> 01:03:42.073]  But the troops aren't wearing masks at a damn hospital where sick people are coming.
[01:03:44.174 --> 01:03:50.798]  I'm afraid, you know, despite the fact that, you know, most Americans have a lot of respect for doctors and nurses.
[01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:57.853]  I'm afraid our aristocracy around here, the power elite, is fully prepared to sacrifice them.
[01:03:57.893 --> 01:03:58.774]  They don't really care.
[01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:01.977]  And they're just sending them into battle here naked.
[01:04:01.997 --> 01:04:12.906]  Well, I've had nurses call and they say, nurses were calling a month ago and two weeks ago, pissed, saying, listen, I know we're healthy, we're incubating this and spreading it to the old people, and they must be doing that on purpose.
[01:04:15.576 --> 01:04:20.341]  Again, I'm afraid, Alex, this is the Nazi philosophy of useless leaders.
[01:04:21.082 --> 01:04:25.166]  The people who run the United States government here are not stupid.
[01:04:26.387 --> 01:04:30.871]  You know, I was trained to be one of them, like Kissinger, like Brzezinski.
[01:04:30.951 --> 01:04:32.493]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:04:32.633 --> 01:04:32.853]  Right.
[01:04:32.913 --> 01:04:38.839]  And you saw this in Britain, where Boris Johnson came out
[01:04:39.468 --> 01:04:40.708]  I don't know what that is.
[01:05:10.256 --> 01:05:17.758]  We had herd immunity from smallpox, so maybe 1% of people that were European got a smallpox because they had had it for hundreds of thousands of years.
[01:05:17.778 --> 01:05:22.420]  The Asians that came across the Bering Strait that we know as Native Americans, they hadn't had it.
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:30.522]  So when we showed up 400 years ago with it, it would kill the half of them when they came in contact with it because they had no herd immunity.
[01:05:30.542 --> 01:05:31.082]  Is that accurate?
[01:05:32.503 --> 01:05:36.424]  Yeah, but herd immunity doesn't apply in this situation.
[01:05:36.504 --> 01:05:39.125]  Basically, Johnson just decided to
[01:05:40.201 --> 01:05:42.964]  Let it run through the British population.
[01:05:43.004 --> 01:05:50.269]  And remember, you know, Johnson's part of the British elite establishment over there.
[01:05:50.289 --> 01:05:51.370]  He went to Oxford.
[01:05:52.251 --> 01:05:58.576]  All those people believe in eugenics, and their predecessors all supported the Nazis.
[01:05:58.716 --> 01:06:03.220]  So, you know, he was quite clear what was going on.
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.461]  I gave a big interview to
[01:06:05.141 --> 01:06:05.902]  We're good to go.
[01:06:24.073 --> 01:06:29.757]  At the press conference, I think it was either Fauci or Birx who mentioned herd immunity.
[01:06:30.097 --> 01:06:45.207]  That's apparently what the real strategy here is, just let it run through the population, and it's only going to take out the untermensch, what the Nazis called the underpeople.
[01:06:46.168 --> 01:06:48.830]  The ubermensch or the superman will be okay.
[01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:52.032]  Right, that goes back to Nietzsche.
[01:06:52.232 --> 01:06:53.153]  That's exactly right.
[01:06:54.158 --> 01:06:55.179]  So let's pull back here.
[01:06:55.199 --> 01:06:58.961]  Of course, Nietzsche was just basically plagiarizing Plato.
[01:06:59.561 --> 01:07:00.441]  And then Hitler picked it up.
[01:07:00.461 --> 01:07:01.322]  We all know what happened there.
[01:07:01.982 --> 01:07:03.963]  Let's just pull back here for a moment, then, Dr. Boyle.
[01:07:04.123 --> 01:07:06.124]  But Hitler picked it up from us, Alex.
[01:07:06.445 --> 01:07:07.265]  Oh, I know.
[01:07:07.305 --> 01:07:09.866]  Well, give people some history on that, and then I have something I want to ask you.
[01:07:09.886 --> 01:07:10.147]  Go ahead.
[01:07:11.587 --> 01:07:13.929]  He got his eugenics philosophy from us.
[01:07:14.309 --> 01:07:15.910]  You know, that's where he got it.
[01:07:17.313 --> 01:07:22.194]  Regretfully, as you know, he applied it to the Jews and the Roma.
[01:07:22.394 --> 01:07:26.235]  And for folks who don't know, you've been involved with the International Court, Hague, in big cases.
[01:07:26.275 --> 01:07:28.615]  Well, the predecessor of that was the Nuremberg Trials.
[01:07:28.915 --> 01:07:32.256]  The Nazi defense was Margaret Sanger, Rockefeller Foundation.
[01:07:32.296 --> 01:07:33.316]  You told us to do this!
[01:07:35.297 --> 01:07:39.538]  Right, all that came up also in the Dockers case, right?
[01:07:41.758 --> 01:07:45.459]  Okay, now, let me just pull back and bring this point up for you.
[01:07:47.799 --> 01:07:48.559]  It's a paradox.
[01:07:48.639 --> 01:07:53.041]  Listeners ask me, they say, hey, you're saying don't panic, don't crash the stock market.
[01:07:53.361 --> 01:07:54.941]  We don't know how bad it is weeks ago.
[01:07:55.741 --> 01:08:02.224]  Well, absolutely, because the left was trying to jump on it and those that want to kick Trump out of power for political gain, trying to create more fear.
[01:08:02.304 --> 01:08:03.124]  Fear is not going to do anything.
[01:08:03.604 --> 01:08:04.464]  Action is going to do something.
[01:08:05.064 --> 01:08:08.465]  But then I have guests on like you that have been saying, no, this is a bio weapon.
[01:08:08.505 --> 01:08:09.526]  It's going to get really bad.
[01:08:10.006 --> 01:08:11.066]  We want people to get ready.
[01:08:11.807 --> 01:08:12.887]  But the paradox is this.
[01:08:14.358 --> 01:08:15.598]  It's obviously a bad virus.
[01:08:15.638 --> 01:08:17.459]  We're going to see how bad it is in our population.
[01:08:17.499 --> 01:08:18.399]  People should get ready.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:21.621]  But the people exacerbating, it'll never end.
[01:08:21.661 --> 01:08:23.001]  You can never leave your house again.
[01:08:23.021 --> 01:08:24.181]  It's a new way of life.
[01:08:24.241 --> 01:08:25.282]  Drones are going to watch you.
[01:08:25.702 --> 01:08:28.203]  Their agenda is evil and they're using it for bad.
[01:08:28.963 --> 01:08:30.984]  The same way, if you look at this,
[01:08:32.168 --> 01:08:33.789]  With what they're doing with vaccines.
[01:08:33.909 --> 01:08:46.535]  I'm no scientist, but I've read tens of thousands of articles and hundreds and hundreds of studies and had probably 50 medical doctors on, many of them prestigious, explaining they can never guess the flu because it mutates too much every year.
[01:08:46.795 --> 01:08:49.437]  And I've got the studies that lowers immunity when you take a bunch of those.
[01:08:49.677 --> 01:08:53.539]  I'm not saying that some of the immunology and vaccines don't work sometimes.
[01:08:53.839 --> 01:08:58.981]  I'm just saying with things like the common cold, they never had a vaccine because the damn thing mutates too much and there's too many of them.
[01:08:59.282 --> 01:09:00.022]  That's a fact!
[01:09:00.402 --> 01:09:09.029]  So them up there saying, you can't leave, we won't let up the lockdown until a vaccine's out in a year is asinine, is false hope.
[01:09:09.250 --> 01:09:16.976]  Then I go read what real virologists and epidemiologists are saying and they're saying, you'll never have a vaccine and this will hurt people if you give it to them.
[01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:18.497]  And I've got the articles right here.
[01:09:18.577 --> 01:09:21.720]  So I'm watching this and even having arguments with family.
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:23.842]  I'm like, listen, the vaccine isn't going to help you.
[01:09:24.082 --> 01:09:25.824]  They're like, Alex, come on, you're not a doctor.
[01:09:26.184 --> 01:09:28.506]  Well, dammit, this is all I do is interview experts.
[01:09:28.786 --> 01:09:29.847]  And so I live this.
[01:09:30.227 --> 01:09:33.410]  And so them giving that false hope pisses me off.
[01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:40.817]  But then they don't want you to know about zinc or vitamin D3 or vitamins that boost immunity.
[01:09:41.337 --> 01:09:48.083]  I've got them literally on the news saying I should be arrested for telling people, hey, you should try to boost your natural immunity.
[01:09:48.123 --> 01:09:48.864]  This is crazy.
[01:09:51.198 --> 01:09:51.418]  Right.
[01:09:51.859 --> 01:09:56.265]  You know, Fauci has been up to vaccines forever, as has Bill Gates.
[01:09:56.465 --> 01:09:57.867]  So you're right.
[01:09:58.327 --> 01:10:04.876]  And so many of these, I'm not saying all vaccines, but so many of them are more dangerous than useless.
[01:10:05.276 --> 01:10:05.496]  Right.
[01:10:05.737 --> 01:10:07.319]  So I think this is just
[01:10:07.979 --> 01:10:08.700]  A mirage.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:21.610]  I think there are other measures that we could focus on, like therapeutics, some degree of social distancing, and try to bring this under control.
[01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.990]  Right.
[01:10:22.451 --> 01:10:25.593]  But I see no point in panicking here.
[01:10:25.733 --> 01:10:32.599]  We have to confront the reality of what we are dealing with, analyze it, and try to move forward.
[01:10:35.185 --> 01:10:44.391]  We put together an eight-minute compilation that's been banned on video back in January, that no one had given any attention, a two-day summit in Switzerland.
[01:10:45.549 --> 01:10:54.697]  Where the head of the World Health Organization, the head scientist, and a bunch of others get up and say, listen, we're given untested vaccines.
[01:10:55.357 --> 01:10:56.358]  It is hurting people.
[01:10:56.538 --> 01:10:57.679]  The doctors are getting pissed.
[01:10:57.699 --> 01:10:59.821]  The people don't believe that there's no side effects.
[01:10:59.861 --> 01:11:03.104]  We lie to them and we're losing the public's confidence.
[01:11:03.444 --> 01:11:05.806]  We need these vaccines tested before they're used.
[01:11:06.227 --> 01:11:08.669]  They're just given to us by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:11:09.773 --> 01:11:13.958]  And I'd ask the crew at the start of the show to ask Rob Deu, who's here, doing a great job.
[01:11:14.278 --> 01:11:16.981]  There's four or five edits of the two-day deal.
[01:11:17.221 --> 01:11:20.004]  There's a four-minute one, an eight-minute one, a 12-minute one, an hour-long one.
[01:11:20.184 --> 01:11:21.966]  If I could have the eight-minute one, they'll know in the file.
[01:11:21.986 --> 01:11:26.831]  If I could have that, it'd be really good, because after the doctor leaves us, I'm going to show you that.
[01:11:27.612 --> 01:11:28.973]  I want tested vaccines.
[01:11:29.513 --> 01:11:30.473]  I want clean vaccines.
[01:11:30.553 --> 01:11:49.280]  It came out during the H1N1 that German elites and British elites and Chinese elites have these super fancy high-tech companies that create expensive vaccines just for them, that have had electron microscopes check them, they've been scanned, they don't have contamination, and then you don't get an autoimmune response to whatever else is in the vaccine.
[01:11:49.501 --> 01:11:50.901]  Like, you know, people died from peanuts?
[01:11:50.941 --> 01:11:52.001]  They were growing it in peanuts.
[01:11:52.302 --> 01:11:52.962]  This is known.
[01:11:53.482 --> 01:11:54.663]  I know this is real.
[01:11:54.843 --> 01:11:56.104]  I want clean vaccines.
[01:11:56.364 --> 01:12:01.967]  Then I can read what the real threat may be, much lower with a clean vaccine, and I can decide if I want it.
[01:12:02.147 --> 01:12:03.828]  Of course I know tetanus shots work.
[01:12:04.088 --> 01:12:04.809]  Of course I know.
[01:12:05.389 --> 01:12:06.590]  It's not that I'm against science.
[01:12:06.990 --> 01:12:11.173]  It's that I know these companies have been given liability protection and
[01:12:11.753 --> 01:12:13.876]  They test experimental crap on troops.
[01:12:13.976 --> 01:12:19.283]  I know a lot of troops who died from these things, like the anthrax vaccine, that was totally unproven and dangerous.
[01:12:19.724 --> 01:12:27.354]  And it pisses me off that science has always had mad scientists, doctor, as you know, but now they're getting liability protection everywhere.
[01:12:27.714 --> 01:12:57.434]  And it's getting crazier and crazier and they're trying to cover up the damage and I wonder where this goes when even the head UN scientist says we're getting a wobbly front line, our own doctors are freaking out and don't want to give this, their own kids are having convulsions and you find out the doctors are paid off by dictators and they're lying and Rick Perry ordered the Gardasil shot, you know, 15 years ago that in studies killed a bunch of people and doesn't protect you from the cancer virus and it just goes on and on.
[01:12:58.074 --> 01:12:58.875]  I know I'm ranting.
[01:12:59.416 --> 01:13:01.077]  I want safe vaccines.
[01:13:01.597 --> 01:13:03.519]  I want clean drugs.
[01:13:03.839 --> 01:13:10.705]  I know I like science, but I don't want to go into the doctor, you know, and they've got flesh-eating bacteria that eat my leg off, you know?
[01:13:10.966 --> 01:13:16.731]  We've got to hold science accountable, and it seems like we're going off the Nazi edge of a cliff again, doctor.
[01:13:19.412 --> 01:13:21.775]  I'm afraid you're right on that, Alex.
[01:13:21.835 --> 01:13:36.290]  You know, these scientists are the new priesthood or something like that, and they expect us to kiss their ring and, you know, go along with whatever they tell us without
[01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:38.951]  Asking some very hard questions.
[01:13:39.591 --> 01:13:44.213]  The biggest question is, he who pays the piper calls the tune.
[01:13:44.713 --> 01:13:50.935]  You know, Bill Gates is paying for all this, and we know he's a genocider and a eugenicist.
[01:13:51.095 --> 01:13:55.777]  So why you would trust anything funded by Bill Gates is behind me.
[01:13:55.797 --> 01:14:03.140]  I believe the Gates funding was behind that Zika pandemic that afflicted
[01:14:04.060 --> 01:14:14.862]  Latin America, as far as I was able to figure out, that was a bioengineered mosquito, probably going back to Fort Collins, U.S.
[01:14:14.902 --> 01:14:19.883]  government lab there that specializes in weaponizing insects.
[01:14:21.104 --> 01:14:23.584]  So yeah, there's a long history of this.
[01:14:24.084 --> 01:14:31.506]  Yes, I was involved in the experimental anthrax and botulin
[01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:39.033]  Vaccines that were given to our troops in the runoff to the Gulf War.
[01:14:39.674 --> 01:14:47.800]  I helped defend Captain Dr. Yohanda Hewitt-Waughn who was court-martialed for refusing to do this.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:53.784]  Let me stop you again because people don't get this how big a guest you are and I'm not kissing your ass.
[01:14:54.365 --> 01:14:56.546]  People that are doers and are active like you
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:02.342]  I've had, like, Dr. Steve Pachinick on, and he's overthrown governments, you know, run psychological operations for the CIA.
[01:15:02.623 --> 01:15:05.524]  He's done so much stuff that I had him on about his memoir one time.
[01:15:05.784 --> 01:15:07.005]  He goes, OK, I'll talk about myself.
[01:15:07.305 --> 01:15:09.606]  He rattled off stuff, and I got all these calls and emails.
[01:15:09.666 --> 01:15:10.566]  That can't be true.
[01:15:10.847 --> 01:15:12.487]  He didn't co-write books with Tom Clancy.
[01:15:12.708 --> 01:15:13.948]  He didn't overthrow that government.
[01:15:14.208 --> 01:15:16.770]  He didn't trick the Communists to kill the Prime Minister of Italy.
[01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:17.850]  Yeah, he did it all.
[01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:21.332]  And he didn't found the Delta Force with General Boykin and Schumacher.
[01:15:21.932 --> 01:15:33.698]  They're here, and it's like, I bring up stuff you've done, and you've been there at every level, but on the good guy side, you know, exposing the anthrax shots and how anthrax folks, they think, might live, you know, 10 million years or something.
[01:15:33.718 --> 01:15:34.998]  I mean, they know thousands of years.
[01:15:35.358 --> 01:15:42.782]  It's basically a plant spore, and how do you attenuate something or make something harmless that is a deadly spore that grows?
[01:15:42.822 --> 01:15:43.462]  You just can't.
[01:15:43.722 --> 01:15:50.506]  So they inject it in guinea pigs, humans, seeing what it'll do, and it killed a bunch of people, and I'd even forgotten that you were at the tip of the spear
[01:15:51.286 --> 01:15:53.928]  Getting the military to stop doing that and save thousands.
[01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:55.229]  I mean, you're a damn hero.
[01:15:55.729 --> 01:16:03.435]  And so when you're up here telling us that you think it's super bad, I take that seriously.
[01:16:03.695 --> 01:16:03.995]  I'm sorry.
[01:16:04.015 --> 01:16:04.335]  Go ahead.
[01:16:05.696 --> 01:16:07.818]  Well, it was Dr. Hewitt Vaughn who was the hero.
[01:16:07.878 --> 01:16:11.120]  She refused to give any of our troops these shots.
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:11.941]  She was facing
[01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:18.480]  Five years and, you know, I was able to get her out of Leavenworth after eight months.
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:21.462]  Was that the Colorado where they first started refusing in Colorado the doctors?
[01:16:21.482 --> 01:16:23.264]  Sorry?
[01:16:24.185 --> 01:16:28.088]  Did the doctors refusing start in Colorado?
[01:16:28.108 --> 01:16:29.089]  Where'd it start?
[01:16:30.130 --> 01:16:32.972]  Well, she was the first one.
[01:16:33.173 --> 01:16:34.914]  I believe she was down in Kansas City.
[01:16:34.954 --> 01:16:36.115]  This was Bush Sr.'
[01:16:36.095 --> 01:16:36.796]  's Gulf War.
[01:16:37.768 --> 01:16:42.091]  And we knew at the time, I got involved at that time.
[01:16:42.172 --> 01:17:04.649]  And by the way, I did want to say that those experimental vaccines issued on our troops in violation of the Nuremberg Code of Medical Experimentation, they were a Nuremberg crime, they've probably murdered at least 11 to 12,000 of our own armed forces and have incapacitated over half a million.
[01:17:05.249 --> 01:17:10.470]  And that was all done under Cheney, Colin Powell, Schwarzkopf.
[01:17:10.650 --> 01:17:12.611]  And then they called it Gulf War Syndrome.
[01:17:12.911 --> 01:17:14.751]  And understand, folks, they had congressional hearings.
[01:17:14.851 --> 01:17:15.531]  They tried it again.
[01:17:15.551 --> 01:17:20.632]  Remember, in 2000, they gave more shots, a bunch of people died, and doctors again stood up to the right thing.
[01:17:20.672 --> 01:17:23.533]  So we're not saying doctors themselves are all evil or bad.
[01:17:23.553 --> 01:17:24.493]  A lot of them are great people.
[01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:28.474]  It's that it's the technocrats on top that are creating the orders.
[01:17:31.192 --> 01:17:33.753]  Well, some of them have stood up and done the right thing.
[01:17:33.853 --> 01:17:34.534]  That's correct.
[01:17:34.654 --> 01:17:37.495]  And regretfully, a lot of the rest of them are on the payroll.
[01:17:37.515 --> 01:17:47.300]  You know, they get breaks on the side to get people to take these experimental vaccines.
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:47.640]  That's right.
[01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:49.141]  They get cruises and money.
[01:17:49.261 --> 01:17:50.062]  And now...
[01:17:51.035 --> 01:17:57.657]  We're about to go through this in the next few years again, trying to make us all take these experimental shots, even though doctors are saying it's going to kill people.
[01:17:57.997 --> 01:18:00.778]  Dr. Boyle, I know you never promote your books, you never promote anything.
[01:18:00.798 --> 01:18:06.279]  Come on, by the goodness of your heart, but tell folks about some of the books you've written and some of the places people can read your writings.
[01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:11.701]  Well, the important book for this case is
[01:18:12.734 --> 01:18:18.616]  My book, Biowarfare and Terrorism, you can get at Amazon.com.
[01:18:18.696 --> 01:18:27.880]  I've written another 20 books or so on different issues you can read if you want to, but I'm not here to sell books, just to inform the public.
[01:18:27.900 --> 01:18:29.700]  Yeah, that's the book.
[01:18:30.481 --> 01:18:34.422]  I'm just down here to inform the American people, my people,
[01:18:35.174 --> 01:18:41.178]  What I think is going on here in accordance with my professional knowledge, judgment and experience.
[01:18:41.458 --> 01:18:46.862]  So, you know, what people, your viewing audience does with it is really up to them.
[01:18:46.942 --> 01:18:58.090]  I mean, we're in a catastrophic situation here where people have to go out and inform themselves and then act on reasonable information
[01:18:58.790 --> 01:19:10.477]  And certainly not believing the outright propaganda that you're getting on ABC, NBC, CNN, and at times, I regret to say, Fox.
[01:19:10.537 --> 01:19:14.019]  Some of those people, I think, are off the wall.
[01:19:14.119 --> 01:19:17.061]  Hannity certainly was at the beginning of this.
[01:19:17.854 --> 01:19:24.518]  Uh, so that, you know, that is why I'm, uh, I'm here, but I'm not, you know, trying to make any money off anything.
[01:19:24.558 --> 01:19:25.198]  No, I understand.
[01:19:25.218 --> 01:19:25.798]  You deserve it.
[01:19:25.879 --> 01:19:27.579]  People need to know about the books you've written.
[01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:33.883]  In closing... I sold the rights to the books over to my publisher so they get the profits, not me.
[01:19:33.943 --> 01:19:44.649]  I get a small royalty and basically I can take my wife out to a nice French restaurant for dinner with my royalties, buy a good bottle of French wine, and that's about it.
[01:19:45.543 --> 01:19:46.043]  Oh, I understand.
[01:19:46.063 --> 01:19:46.784]  You've done a great job.
[01:19:47.244 --> 01:19:50.045]  In closing, when do you think the peak of this comes?
[01:19:51.026 --> 01:19:55.328]  And again, a lot of people think they can piggyback some other attacks in here now that this is going on.
[01:19:55.368 --> 01:19:59.070]  Historically, once crazy stuff breaks out, it tends to trigger more insanity.
[01:19:59.110 --> 01:20:00.871]  Calamities tend to cascade.
[01:20:03.773 --> 01:20:07.155]  Well, again, I just disagree with Birx and Fauci.
[01:20:07.635 --> 01:20:13.338]  I don't think, I think we're, you know, this is increasing exponentially.
[01:20:14.411 --> 01:20:18.316]  I saw Governor Cuomo say, well, the peak will be in two weeks.
[01:20:19.317 --> 01:20:21.098]  I really don't know about that, Alex.
[01:20:22.520 --> 01:20:25.303]  I think we're a bit from any type of peak at all.
[01:20:26.346 --> 01:20:30.290]  And I'm still afraid it's going to get a lot worse before it gets any better.
[01:20:30.990 --> 01:20:31.991]  I regret to say that.
[01:20:32.572 --> 01:20:40.258]  Well, a lot of the models show that even if your body was locked up for months, it's still just going to bounce around, and then it'll just create other chain reactions later.
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:42.680]  There's just no telling.
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:44.182]  It's that whole butterfly effect.
[01:20:44.562 --> 01:20:46.063]  Thank you so much, Dr. Boyle, for all the time.
[01:20:47.905 --> 01:20:50.728]  Well, thanks again, Alex, and my best to
[01:20:51.681 --> 01:20:56.262]  You're a viewing audience and for those of you who are Jewish, happy Passover.
[01:20:56.322 --> 01:20:58.483]  For those of you who are Christian, have a good Easter.
[01:20:59.363 --> 01:20:59.783]  God bless.
[01:21:00.443 --> 01:21:02.324]  Okay, that's commercial-free.
[01:21:02.484 --> 01:21:13.587]  I've been going for an hour and 20 minutes and I always tell listeners and viewers what I know and I'm usually very decisive because I know what I'm talking about.
[01:21:13.607 --> 01:21:14.967]  I mean, I know
[01:21:16.598 --> 01:21:17.879]  Lord Rothschild said this.
[01:21:18.739 --> 01:21:20.600]  I know they crashed the stock market this way.
[01:21:21.100 --> 01:21:22.321]  I know the CIA did this.
[01:21:22.501 --> 01:21:23.862]  I know Himmler did this.
[01:21:23.982 --> 01:21:24.882]  I know Hitler did that.
[01:21:24.922 --> 01:21:25.543]  I know Stalin.
[01:21:25.783 --> 01:21:28.244]  We know things that are accepted and proven, documented.
[01:21:30.125 --> 01:21:36.729]  When you get into these viruses, and you know it's a bioweapon, and you know they covered up what really went on in China, did they exaggerate it?
[01:21:36.769 --> 01:21:37.529]  Did they cover it up?
[01:21:37.649 --> 01:21:40.331]  I think it's mounting evidence they covered up just how bad it was.
[01:21:41.051 --> 01:21:42.472]  I had a responsibility
[01:21:43.524 --> 01:21:48.345]  Not to just sit here when I couldn't figure out what was going on and say, this is really bad for sure.
[01:21:48.845 --> 01:21:50.766]  And at a certain level, I don't like seeing the fear.
[01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:56.507]  I don't like seeing all the piggyback police state, big brother, surveillance grid stuff going along with this.
[01:21:59.048 --> 01:22:07.269]  But, it's really hard to know the truth of what's going on.
[01:22:08.690 --> 01:22:09.430]  I respect Boyle.
[01:22:10.589 --> 01:22:12.690]  And he's interviewed and talked to all the top scientists.
[01:22:12.730 --> 01:22:14.110]  He's been involved in all these cases.
[01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:15.291]  I mean, he knows what he's talking about.
[01:22:15.591 --> 01:22:16.091]  And you heard him.
[01:22:16.111 --> 01:22:18.532]  He said it's preposterous to say a vaccine will help you.
[01:22:19.312 --> 01:22:20.493]  It's pure crap.
[01:22:22.453 --> 01:22:24.254]  With the flu and especially the common cold.
[01:22:26.135 --> 01:22:28.516]  There are hundreds and hundreds of different flus every year.
[01:22:29.336 --> 01:22:31.677]  They've never once guessed how it's going to mutate.
[01:22:34.238 --> 01:22:36.919]  So we know on that, that's a fact.
[01:22:40.495 --> 01:22:41.716]  And I'm not happy about that.
[01:22:41.876 --> 01:22:45.218]  If they had a vaccine and they had trials and it did something, boy, that's great.
[01:22:47.319 --> 01:22:48.720]  But it doesn't work like that.
[01:22:51.042 --> 01:22:52.203]  It doesn't work like that.
[01:22:53.123 --> 01:22:54.904]  So I believe Boyle believes what he's saying.
[01:22:55.805 --> 01:22:59.087]  And evidence is starting to mount that the Chinese covered up and it was much worse.
[01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:03.690]  But we're going to find out.
[01:23:05.591 --> 01:23:06.392]  I do know this, though.
[01:23:07.659 --> 01:23:14.744]  The effects of the robot takeover and the surveillance and everything that's coming out of it is detrimental to the state of humanity, period.
[01:23:14.804 --> 01:23:28.373]  And we can't decide to be bubble people living in pods, going into the matrix willingly, which is a real plan by the way, you can't make this stuff up, into a virtual reality because the outside environment's gonna get us.
[01:23:29.434 --> 01:23:31.296]  The outside environment's always going to get in.
[01:23:31.736 --> 01:23:34.618]  You have to boost your immune system, you have to overcome, you have to get stronger.
[01:23:35.842 --> 01:23:40.246]  And the fact that they don't want you to know that shows you the evil behind this whole thing.
[01:23:40.566 --> 01:23:44.991]  And Dr. Boyle is not going to sit there and say the Chinese released it unless he sees proof.
[01:23:45.311 --> 01:23:46.052]  It's man-made.
[01:23:47.213 --> 01:23:48.133]  Maybe it leaked out.
[01:23:48.294 --> 01:23:51.897]  But with all the pre-positioning, everything that happened, I believe they released it on purpose.
[01:23:52.177 --> 01:23:53.699]  And I can tell you the Pentagon believes that.
[01:23:53.979 --> 01:23:56.361]  And I can tell you the Senate Intelligence Committee knows that.
[01:23:56.641 --> 01:23:57.722]  And I said that eight weeks ago.
[01:23:57.742 --> 01:23:58.583]  They're now saying that.
[01:23:59.144 --> 01:24:01.145]  And I made some phone calls today and talked to some folks.
[01:24:02.099 --> 01:24:09.180]  Let's just say in the more secretive areas of things, and the consensus is we're under Chinese and yes, globalist attack.
[01:24:09.560 --> 01:24:11.081]  The Democrats are exacerbating it.
[01:24:11.121 --> 01:24:12.161]  They're with Xi Jinping.
[01:24:12.441 --> 01:24:13.421]  They're with the EU.
[01:24:14.121 --> 01:24:16.702]  And this is an attack on nation states and on the individual.
[01:24:17.102 --> 01:24:21.523]  And whether they launched it or not, they're certainly using it and exacerbating it.
[01:24:21.923 --> 01:24:26.524]  And the Chinese are, many of them celebrating on TV, saying they're sending it over here to kill us.
[01:24:26.764 --> 01:24:28.204]  And none of them are getting arrested or in trouble.
[01:24:30.034 --> 01:24:36.897]  So this is a Qaikom temper tantrum and a leftist temper tantrum because Trump's arresting all these Chinese spies and agents around the United States.
[01:24:36.957 --> 01:24:41.959]  So you've got all these separate things going on while this virus is ravaging.
[01:24:43.720 --> 01:24:45.741]  The flu usually kills 35,000 people.
[01:24:46.121 --> 01:24:47.642]  Trump says he has the number 37,000 in 2019.
[01:24:47.782 --> 01:24:48.682]  Okay.
[01:24:48.762 --> 01:24:53.264]  I'll say that's true.
[01:24:53.404 --> 01:24:54.104]  Most of them sick.
[01:24:54.765 --> 01:24:56.585]  But it's still ravaging 37,000 lot of people.
[01:24:58.268 --> 01:24:59.912]  That's in the top 10 ways to die.
[01:25:00.998 --> 01:25:05.379]  But if you look at school shootings, less than 100 a year, but it's still terrible.
[01:25:05.399 --> 01:25:06.819]  We can't allow one more child to die.
[01:25:06.939 --> 01:25:08.000]  All gun owners are to blame.
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:14.741]  We're almost losing our Second Amendment on the fraud that because somebody else did something wrong with a tool, we've got to get rid of a tool.
[01:25:15.241 --> 01:25:28.164]  Well, now because 100,000 of us might die from some horrible virus that's man-made, instead of the Chinese or whoever did this getting in trouble and stopping the Level 4 labs and stopping this in the future, we all say, oh, we'll all just live in bubbles now.
[01:25:28.464 --> 01:25:29.424]  And never go out again!
[01:25:29.444 --> 01:25:30.965]  And have robots do everything!
[01:25:33.206 --> 01:25:37.707]  Because we let Fauci involve the HIV garbage and all of it run the show!
[01:25:38.047 --> 01:25:40.688]  And that damn Bill Gates!
[01:25:41.329 --> 01:25:44.190]  You think I want to get up here and talk bad about Bill Gates?
[01:25:46.410 --> 01:25:47.311]  The man is a killer!
[01:25:49.131 --> 01:25:53.093]  I've been threatened many times that if I don't shut up and stop saying this, I'm dead.
[01:25:56.002 --> 01:26:00.623]  And I just want it known that I'm not doing this to be some macho tough guy.
[01:26:00.643 --> 01:26:02.924]  I am not signing on to this type of crap.
[01:26:03.864 --> 01:26:13.706]  And let me tell you, I go to the grocery store, I go to a water park, the public, black, white, Hispanic, old, young, look like they got beat with an ugly stick and they're mutated blob-like creatures.
[01:26:15.386 --> 01:26:20.187]  And they had fluoride put in their water from birth and they were put in front of a television, they were fed poison on purpose.
[01:26:20.468 --> 01:26:22.348]  You look at all these big companies, they're evil.
[01:26:24.380 --> 01:26:34.945]  So just because you did this to us, and we went along with it, and just because we're weak, doesn't mean you get to organize it and sit on it and get off on it, because you're even weaker.
[01:26:35.165 --> 01:26:47.932]  You're sick predators that knew about the fallen nature of humans, and so you decided to use it for your own power to sit on top of giant stinking sewer, instead of empowering people, which you could have done!
[01:26:48.911 --> 01:26:54.977]  In a culture of strength and honor and ritualized combat and building people up.
[01:26:55.858 --> 01:26:56.118]  No!
[01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:02.364]  You chose the dark side, the evil path, to dumb people down so you could rule over them.
[01:27:07.529 --> 01:27:09.811]  So I'm not in some pissing contest with Bill Gates.
[01:27:09.871 --> 01:27:11.793]  I need to have a message to Bill Gates sometime.
[01:27:12.494 --> 01:27:13.635]  I'm not ready to do it today, but...
[01:27:17.386 --> 01:27:20.408]  It would be so easy back on the path to have joined these guys.
[01:27:22.729 --> 01:27:23.610]  My dad didn't join them.
[01:27:23.830 --> 01:27:24.631]  They tried to hire him.
[01:27:25.251 --> 01:27:27.653]  They try to hire everybody that's got the spark.
[01:27:28.954 --> 01:27:31.755]  And as soon as you join with these Satanists, you lose that spark.
[01:27:33.056 --> 01:27:34.017]  You become a slave.
[01:27:34.757 --> 01:27:36.218]  It's very cold to serve Satan.
[01:27:37.339 --> 01:27:39.120]  And I mean, because I felt the edges of it.
[01:27:40.581 --> 01:27:43.383]  And I just can't do it.
[01:27:44.716 --> 01:27:46.117]  I just cannot join Satan.
[01:27:46.257 --> 01:27:47.037]  I will not do it.
[01:27:47.137 --> 01:27:47.877]  I can't be part of it.
[01:27:48.377 --> 01:27:54.320]  But to see everyone else going headlong, being deceived, when it's so obvious and all admitted.
[01:27:54.340 --> 01:27:56.240]  I mean, Bill Gates says he wants to kill everybody.
[01:27:57.201 --> 01:27:59.182]  And then he wants to save you right now with a shot.
[01:27:59.242 --> 01:27:59.942]  I mean, give me a break.
[01:28:00.222 --> 01:28:05.804]  He metaphysically needs you to go take the shot.
[01:28:06.684 --> 01:28:08.065]  The vampire wants you to open the door.
[01:28:10.768 --> 01:28:17.039]  And he really believes he's saving the planet from the scourge of too many people and the dumb people.
[01:28:23.134 --> 01:28:28.196]  Because he's already decided you're all dumb and scum, so he's gonna put fluoride in there, so you're more manageable.
[01:28:28.276 --> 01:28:28.656]  We'll see.
[01:28:28.696 --> 01:28:33.218]  No, he knows in the mud is where the lily grows.
[01:28:33.238 --> 01:28:45.784]  In fact, I've read some of his writings where he has, I'm worried about small companies, startups, things that'll, that's why he tries to buy everything up, just like Google, is because he actually fears the grassroots.
[01:28:47.588 --> 01:28:50.469]  Because it's not sociopathic and psychotic.
[01:28:51.549 --> 01:28:57.491]  When you join with the dark side, it starts taking over your will until you're not yourself anymore.
[01:28:57.871 --> 01:29:03.813]  And you're an evil robot that slithers around carrying out its operation.
[01:29:04.174 --> 01:29:05.414]  I don't want to be a robot!
[01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:12.943]  And fly around in jet helicopters and be in palaces with everyone kissing my ass.
[01:29:13.383 --> 01:29:29.353]  And then these people are totally just... When they're not out doing evil, folks, they are like... And that's why they run around doing evil continually is because they only get the spark when they're doing evil.
[01:29:30.486 --> 01:29:38.596]  I've interviewed a lot of famous psychiatrists that have interviewed men and worked with serial killers that are the low-level dumb ones that get caught.
[01:29:40.598 --> 01:29:42.641]  And they feel like they're not alive.
[01:29:45.233 --> 01:29:50.496]  And they're tortured and scared by demons and just, and evil and nightmares.
[01:29:51.017 --> 01:29:56.600]  And just, they feel powerless until they kidnap a little girl and torture her and rape her.
[01:29:56.900 --> 01:30:03.264]  And as they're being used up in entire horror, they feel like bright light and fun and empowered.
[01:30:03.604 --> 01:30:10.789]  And they're only given those moments of rest when they're doing evil.
[01:30:13.220 --> 01:30:13.820]  I forget her name.
[01:30:13.860 --> 01:30:14.321]  I had her on.
[01:30:14.521 --> 01:30:17.143]  Type in famous psychiatrist to serial killers.
[01:30:17.363 --> 01:30:19.104]  I heard her on Coast to Coast like 20 years ago.
[01:30:19.745 --> 01:30:21.206]  Got her on a couple times.
[01:30:21.286 --> 01:30:25.709]  And I hadn't even read her books, but I was saying, is it?
[01:30:25.729 --> 01:30:27.310]  And she goes, yes, that's actually true.
[01:30:27.370 --> 01:30:27.950]  How do you know that?
[01:30:27.970 --> 01:30:29.772]  She goes, because I haven't put a lot of that in my books.
[01:30:29.812 --> 01:30:30.712]  People can't handle it.
[01:30:30.752 --> 01:30:34.055]  But they are all pretty much tortured by demons.
[01:30:34.095 --> 01:30:38.178]  And I said, it's just like in the remake of
[01:30:39.735 --> 01:30:43.776]  The Manchurian candidate, when they give him the activation words, he's got a chip in his brain.
[01:30:44.196 --> 01:30:46.537]  It's like he goes from being like this to like bright light.
[01:30:47.017 --> 01:30:50.117]  And that's because I've talked to real Satanist folks and people.
[01:30:51.838 --> 01:30:52.738]  And that's what it's like.
[01:30:54.218 --> 01:30:55.479]  And they're very, very scared.
[01:30:55.859 --> 01:31:04.481]  And I've known, I've known, Luciferians is really what it is, known some of them and who've been still at some soul and still were kind of scared.
[01:31:06.158 --> 01:31:09.964]  Like Hillary Clinton famously, not to me, but to Larry Nichols said.
[01:31:10.785 --> 01:31:19.029]  Well, you know, I go to the Satanic Temple, and I go to the Native American Temple, and I go to the Jewish Temple, and I go to the Christian Temple, and she goes, just to cover my bases.
[01:31:19.649 --> 01:31:29.634]  She's so sociopathic and disconnected, she knows there's power there, but she goes to those places trying to find the spirit, and she's not sure which one.
[01:31:29.894 --> 01:31:36.557]  She just knows the evil is real and gave her power, but she's so cut off, she's trying to go and, like, punch buttons.
[01:31:36.797 --> 01:31:39.719]  Like, well, maybe if I just, you know, go to church sometimes, I'll...
[01:31:40.239 --> 01:31:40.840]  Think about that.
[01:31:41.420 --> 01:31:49.346]  No, Hillary, you had to say no to Satan and do good, not go your first job out of college, go represent the mafia in Arkansas.
[01:31:49.366 --> 01:31:53.650]  Anybody that knows about the real mafia, that's where the actual nationwide mafia is actually based.
[01:31:55.311 --> 01:31:57.573]  You don't ever put your corporate office, you know, where you really operate.
[01:31:58.294 --> 01:32:08.262]  And she represented child rapists and murderers and people that she particularly went out and said, I want to represent rich people that kidnap and rape children.
[01:32:10.686 --> 01:32:12.047]  And they were like, good girl.
[01:32:13.108 --> 01:32:19.432]  And she laughed about it on tape and said, I knew they grabbed that 11-year-old girl and raped her and seven men till her, till her cervix was crushing.
[01:32:19.892 --> 01:32:22.574]  You know, her, her uterus was prolapsing out on the ground.
[01:32:23.835 --> 01:32:24.035]  Yeah.
[01:32:24.556 --> 01:32:27.198]  She's like laughing about it.
[01:32:27.598 --> 01:32:28.639]  Raping little girls.
[01:32:28.679 --> 01:32:31.481]  Cause that's who the end of the quote of them.
[01:32:31.501 --> 01:32:32.421]  They're like, you're good.
[01:32:32.741 --> 01:32:33.302]  You're in with us.
[01:32:33.342 --> 01:32:35.023]  Now you like to rape 11 year old girls.
[01:32:40.919 --> 01:32:44.580]  Portly took a broomstick after they were all done and just wrecked her out, you know?
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:45.521]  We're liberal!
[01:32:45.781 --> 01:32:46.561]  Ah, Hillary Clinton!
[01:32:46.661 --> 01:32:47.741]  Ah, liberal, liberal!
[01:32:48.082 --> 01:32:52.843]  And all these little leftists walk around getting off on worshipping her, because they're all little empty demons.
[01:32:53.043 --> 01:32:58.325]  They see a big demon and they feel powerful when she's walking around going, I'm Hillary Clinton, how you doing?
[01:32:59.566 --> 01:33:00.926]  They go, oh, nasty!
[01:33:02.287 --> 01:33:03.567]  I deported my baby, you know?
[01:33:03.587 --> 01:33:06.088]  He's like, good till more, my servant!
[01:33:10.253 --> 01:33:11.214]  Go to a Hillary event.
[01:33:11.274 --> 01:33:12.374]  Everyone's perching-ling.
[01:33:13.735 --> 01:33:16.376]  They're all child molesters and devil worshippers.
[01:33:22.139 --> 01:33:22.800]  Oh my God.
[01:33:24.761 --> 01:33:25.541]  Yeah, that's the lady.
[01:33:27.082 --> 01:33:29.803]  Yeah, I'm gonna stop.
[01:33:30.564 --> 01:33:33.345]  I gotta get these video clips, because this is a two-hour transmission.
[01:33:33.365 --> 01:33:33.705]  It's live.
[01:33:33.765 --> 01:33:34.586]  I said I'd take calls.
[01:33:36.018 --> 01:33:37.158]  You guys want to go three hours?
[01:33:37.198 --> 01:33:37.979]  We want to get out of here.
[01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:39.119]  I'll go three hours.
[01:33:39.159 --> 01:33:40.600]  John Harmon came in here to take the calls.
[01:33:40.940 --> 01:33:41.840]  Let's take some calls.
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:42.760]  We'll take five calls.
[01:33:43.421 --> 01:33:46.022]  And then next time I do this special transmission, we'll take more.
[01:33:46.042 --> 01:33:46.842]  I'll take a lot tomorrow.
[01:33:46.862 --> 01:33:47.722]  4 to 6 p.m.
[01:33:47.742 --> 01:33:48.142]  I promise.
[01:33:48.162 --> 01:33:48.222]  877-789-2539.
[01:33:48.242 --> 01:33:48.322]  877-789-2539.
[01:33:48.342 --> 01:33:48.422]  877-789-2539.
[01:33:48.462 --> 01:33:50.923]  But the big tell here is it's man-made and they don't want you to know about zinc.
[01:33:50.943 --> 01:33:52.484]  They don't want you to know about iodine.
[01:33:52.504 --> 01:33:56.245]  They don't want you to know about
[01:34:05.458 --> 01:34:07.840]  Vitamin C, vitamin D3, it's pure evil.
[01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:15.686]  All right, since I mentioned all this, let's play the four minute clip of the UN head scientist and others at their event in December 2nd.
[01:34:18.632 --> 01:34:22.294]  We really don't have very good safety monitoring systems in many countries and this adds to the
[01:34:43.666 --> 01:34:53.964]  Communication and the misapprehensions because we're not able to give clear-cut answers when people ask questions about the deaths that have occurred due to particular vaccine and this always gets blown up in the media.
[01:34:55.133 --> 01:35:01.296]  One should be able to give a very factual account of what exactly has happened and what the cause of deaths are.
[01:35:01.336 --> 01:35:06.799]  But in most cases there's some obfuscation at that level and therefore there's less and less trust.
[01:35:06.999 --> 01:35:10.661]  The first accusation is it is the adjuvant.
[01:35:11.041 --> 01:35:15.163]  And yet without adjuvants we are not going to have the next generation of vaccines.
[01:35:15.603 --> 01:35:19.545]  And many of the vaccines that we do have, ranging from tetanus through to HPV,
[01:35:20.405 --> 01:35:22.467]  Require adjuvants in order for them to work.
[01:35:22.827 --> 01:35:25.889]  When we add an adjuvant, it's because it is essential.
[01:35:26.669 --> 01:35:30.192]  We do not add adjuvants to vaccines because we want to do so.
[01:35:30.872 --> 01:35:34.414]  But when we add them, it adds to the complexity.
[01:35:35.055 --> 01:35:39.298]  And I give courses every year on how do you develop vaccines?
[01:35:39.338 --> 01:35:40.318]  How do you make vaccines?
[01:35:40.778 --> 01:35:41.899]  And the first lesson is
[01:35:43.396 --> 01:35:47.460]  While you're making your vaccine, if you can avoid using an adjuvant, please do so.
[01:35:47.840 --> 01:36:00.472]  It seems to me that adjuvants multiply the immunogenicity of the antigens that they are added to, and that is their intention.
[01:36:01.292 --> 01:36:06.117]  It seems to me they multiply the reactogenicity in many instances.
[01:36:07.592 --> 01:36:25.548]  And therefore it seems to me that it is not unexpected if they multiply the incidence of adverse reactions that are associated with the antigen but may not have been detected through lack of statistical power in the original study.
[01:36:25.829 --> 01:36:31.594]  The major health concern which we are seeing are accusations of long-term effects.
[01:36:32.088 --> 01:36:40.101]  It's also the subject population that you administer the adjuvant to because we've seen data presented to us where
[01:36:41.337 --> 01:36:58.504]  An adjuvant, a particular adjuvant added to a vaccine antigen did really nothing when administered to a certain population and it's usually the elderly, you know, compared to administering the same formulation to younger age strata.
[01:36:58.904 --> 01:37:07.908]  So these are things which need to be considered as well and further complicate safety and effectiveness evaluation of adjuvants combined with vaccine antigens.
[01:37:08.488 --> 01:37:19.610]  I cast back my mind to our situation in Nigeria, where at six weeks, 10 weeks, 14 weeks, a child is being given different antigens from different companies.
[01:37:20.791 --> 01:37:24.592]  And these vaccines have different adjuvants, different preservatives, and so on.
[01:37:25.112 --> 01:37:26.372]  Something crosses my mind.
[01:37:27.992 --> 01:37:32.893]  Is there a possibility of these adjuvants, preservatives, cross-reacting amongst themselves?
[01:37:33.534 --> 01:37:34.974]  Have there ever been a study
[01:37:42.634 --> 01:37:51.917]  We have a very wobbly health professional frontline that is starting to question vaccines and the safety of vaccines.
[01:37:52.457 --> 01:38:03.881]  When the frontline professionals are starting to question or they don't feel like they have enough confidence about the safety to stand up to it, to
[01:38:04.611 --> 01:38:05.712]  Did you hear that folks?
[01:38:05.732 --> 01:38:05.992]  So we have
[01:38:27.577 --> 01:38:30.698]  Hour-long videos, eight-minute ones, that's a little four-minute video.
[01:38:31.118 --> 01:38:39.699]  I've decided to go some into the next hour, then we'll just loop this until, on the radio and TV satellites, until the regular show hits tomorrow, 4 to 6 p.m.
[01:38:40.260 --> 01:38:42.440]  Then you got my weekday show, 11 a.m.
[01:38:42.980 --> 01:38:43.560]  to 3 p.m.
[01:38:43.580 --> 01:38:46.621]  You got the War Room with Owen Schroer, you got David Knight, weekday mornings at 8 a.m.
[01:38:47.441 --> 01:38:54.623]  And let me just stop for a minute, because every time I start talking about this stuff, I get really upset that I'm not doing a good enough job.
[01:38:54.643 --> 01:38:56.503]  And I mean that, folks.
[01:38:58.331 --> 01:39:05.314]  So I meant to start this broadcast a different way today, but then I look at all the articles and videos, and we get ready for the show, and I get distracted.
[01:39:07.656 --> 01:39:13.538]  And I know I'm always urgent here on air, because this has been very urgent for years, knowing all this and knowing it's real.
[01:39:13.558 --> 01:39:26.665]  I mean, when you sit there with the White House Science Czar's book, and he says they put fluoride in the water to make us more manageable and make us dumb, I mean, he's physically assaulting us.
[01:39:28.336 --> 01:39:31.097]  When they put 5G up, the people putting it up don't know what they're doing.
[01:39:31.117 --> 01:39:32.998]  The people that did it are assaulting you.
[01:39:33.158 --> 01:39:36.799]  I have a stack of mainline science admitting it gives you cancer.
[01:39:39.701 --> 01:39:44.222]  Ladies and gentlemen, a lot of people report in the areas 5G went in, like D.C.
[01:39:44.242 --> 01:39:45.963]  and New York, they said it makes them dizzy.
[01:39:46.803 --> 01:39:48.224]  I feel great all the time, folks.
[01:39:50.005 --> 01:39:50.885]  I was in D.C.
[01:39:50.965 --> 01:39:52.486]  with my wife twice this year.
[01:39:53.595 --> 01:39:56.177]  And both times, I'm like, man, do I have a sinus headache?
[01:39:56.217 --> 01:39:56.817]  Am I sick?
[01:39:57.338 --> 01:40:03.042]  And then as soon as we leave the major highways, I felt good, and I went, wait a minute, let me see if there's 5G.
[01:40:03.402 --> 01:40:04.483]  It was 5G.
[01:40:06.545 --> 01:40:12.689]  And that's what people say, is it makes you feel sick, just like people didn't know 400 years ago about oxygen.
[01:40:14.050 --> 01:40:15.451]  But they called it mountain sickness.
[01:40:15.491 --> 01:40:18.333]  When you got up above 10,000 feet, people got tired, they got sick.
[01:40:18.694 --> 01:40:21.456]  And they thought, the scientists back then thought the air was thinner.
[01:40:21.476 --> 01:40:22.597]  You know, they knew you needed air.
[01:40:23.715 --> 01:40:26.677]  They said the air is thin and has vapors.
[01:40:27.937 --> 01:40:28.498]  They didn't know.
[01:40:34.221 --> 01:40:35.902]  But you can't see the air.
[01:40:37.382 --> 01:40:37.883]  But it's there.
[01:40:38.103 --> 01:40:39.964]  And if there's not air there, you get sick.
[01:40:42.865 --> 01:40:44.146]  Well, it's the same thing, folks.
[01:40:44.726 --> 01:40:46.027]  I'm not a hypochondriac.
[01:40:46.687 --> 01:40:50.990]  And I've got all the studies that one of the things is people get restless, they get dizzy, and
[01:40:52.034 --> 01:40:54.235]  My wife is in DC, she goes, I gotta get out of here!
[01:40:55.876 --> 01:40:57.197]  And my wife's like a horse, man.
[01:40:57.317 --> 01:40:58.078]  She doesn't get sick.
[01:40:58.238 --> 01:41:00.639]  She looks like a Greek statue with her clothes off, I'm just telling you.
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:05.302]  She literally is like, and then we finally figured it out.
[01:41:09.005 --> 01:41:13.788]  I was wondering why I'll have my car on recirculate, thinking it was pollen.
[01:41:14.648 --> 01:41:15.949]  And I'm like, it's the damnedest thing.
[01:41:15.969 --> 01:41:20.272]  When I go downtown, I was telling my wife this about a month ago, and I'm in traffic and stuff.
[01:41:21.875 --> 01:41:26.678]  I get a headache and I get dizzy now, and I said, but I've got the curl and recirculate, it's not pollen.
[01:41:27.238 --> 01:41:29.719]  And then I went and looked, it's all 5G.
[01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:36.043]  You spend 30 minutes in that crap, man, you are dizzy, you got a headache, and everybody's reporting this, folks.
[01:41:38.264 --> 01:41:40.885]  You know the gamma rays and all the rest of it, a bunch of different radiation.
[01:41:40.905 --> 01:41:42.086]  I was talking to an airline pilot the other day.
[01:41:43.647 --> 01:41:59.770]  And they admit that every time you fly during the day on an hour flight, it's this many, you know, it's like one chest x-ray and five hour flights, like five chest x-rays at 35,000 feet, because there's not all the water vapor blocking radiation in space.
[01:42:00.650 --> 01:42:10.912]  I mean, you go out in space when they have a solar flare and you're in a spacesuit and you don't get behind the water tanks in that ship or some of the little lead shielding they've got, you just knocked years off your life.
[01:42:13.578 --> 01:42:17.903]  Say that astronaut's hitting those flares, that's why it's a pretty tough thing to go up there, especially if you're on the space station.
[01:42:18.343 --> 01:42:19.524]  You're getting hit by stuff all the time.
[01:42:19.564 --> 01:42:21.487]  Those people all die young, folks.
[01:42:22.728 --> 01:42:23.709]  Because of the radiation.
[01:42:23.729 --> 01:42:25.991]  And by the way, I'm not telling you something that's speculation.
[01:42:26.332 --> 01:42:28.935]  Space is full of radiation!
[01:42:29.235 --> 01:42:29.956]  From the sun!
[01:42:31.220 --> 01:42:39.587]  But we've got the equivalent in the first 50,000 feet of air of about, depending on the humidity on a day, 15 to 20 feet of water.
[01:42:40.167 --> 01:42:40.767]  There's water.
[01:42:40.787 --> 01:42:43.470]  If you condense all the water in the atmosphere down, 15, 20 feet of water.
[01:42:45.391 --> 01:42:47.553]  There's about two inches of dust and rock.
[01:42:48.373 --> 01:42:51.095]  So you got a shield of a couple, and you're like, well, wait, I don't see a shield of rock.
[01:42:51.356 --> 01:42:52.276]  It's all dissipated.
[01:42:52.617 --> 01:42:56.380]  Again, why does the sun, when it sets, look bigger?
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:42:59.042]  Why does the moon, when it rises, look red?
[01:43:00.043 --> 01:43:03.265]  And then up, as it goes up, it's yellow, and then it gets up, it's white.
[01:43:03.905 --> 01:43:09.428]  Because you're looking through less atmosphere straight up, than when it's on the horizon, it's like a lens.
[01:43:09.488 --> 01:43:15.030]  It looks bigger, and it looks red, because the dust is red-colored.
[01:43:16.731 --> 01:43:17.292]  That's a fact!
[01:43:18.152 --> 01:43:19.873]  The moon isn't bigger when it comes up!
[01:43:20.133 --> 01:43:21.174]  You're looking through.
[01:43:21.434 --> 01:43:24.075]  Take a pair of glasses, the lenses, and look to the side.
[01:43:24.095 --> 01:43:25.436]  It's all blurry, it blows things up.
[01:43:25.996 --> 01:43:27.737]  Look through this way, it only blows up a little bit.
[01:43:28.712 --> 01:43:29.392]  It's the same thing.
[01:43:29.592 --> 01:43:36.614]  All I'm saying is that 5G is super powerful.
[01:43:37.174 --> 01:43:42.195]  It doesn't go far because of how the wavelengths go out.
[01:43:43.135 --> 01:43:48.756]  But if you are up close to that, you dead.
[01:43:50.556 --> 01:43:58.258]  And that's why just last year they stuck it on the school in California and over 10% of the kids got cancer.
[01:43:59.795 --> 01:44:00.195]  Like that.
[01:44:00.415 --> 01:44:01.977]  You ain't gonna have to wait, folks.
[01:44:02.177 --> 01:44:02.917]  I've got the articles.
[01:44:02.937 --> 01:44:03.458]  You can look them up.
[01:44:04.619 --> 01:44:06.100]  This stuff's so damn bad.
[01:44:07.421 --> 01:44:11.804]  What, you think you can download a five-hour, you know, a video in one second?
[01:44:13.185 --> 01:44:16.207]  What the hell do you think's coming out of that thing, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:44:18.008 --> 01:44:20.010]  You can't see it, but it's there.
[01:44:23.332 --> 01:44:25.534]  Just these lights in here are more modern.
[01:44:25.554 --> 01:44:27.656]  Don't hurt your eyes as bad, but it's killing my eyesight.
[01:44:29.724 --> 01:44:32.564]  They used to hang people up in front of lights for like six months to torture them.
[01:44:33.445 --> 01:44:34.925]  Happened to Rolf Steiner.
[01:44:35.385 --> 01:44:38.345]  Read a great book about that commando, the French Foreign Legion in Africa.
[01:44:38.846 --> 01:44:42.466]  They hung him up for a year in front of lights when he got captured and he was blind after that basically.
[01:44:42.946 --> 01:44:46.027]  But the point is, is that you can't see the light.
[01:44:46.067 --> 01:44:49.787]  You can see it emitting out of the diodes, out of the bulb.
[01:44:50.888 --> 01:44:52.588]  You can see it when it hits something.
[01:44:53.368 --> 01:44:54.988]  The reflection, you can't see the light.
[01:44:55.628 --> 01:44:57.109]  White is reflecting everything.
[01:44:57.569 --> 01:44:59.009]  Black is absorbing everything.
[01:45:00.267 --> 01:45:25.324]  And I know all of you know this, but this is what you've got to get, folks, that I can build a particle beam, not a laser beam, for about $3,000 with stuff I can buy online, that I could come into this office and park it in the wall over there and sit there and hit a button for the next month in one of the employees and, you know, they would die of cancer
[01:45:26.361 --> 01:45:27.962]  Or start bleeding out very, very soon.
[01:45:28.002 --> 01:45:29.143]  It would just fry all their tissue.
[01:45:29.163 --> 01:45:31.084]  How many of you go in to get radiated and they kind of miss?
[01:45:31.104 --> 01:45:33.905]  You know, like my great-uncle went in for pancreatic cancer.
[01:45:33.965 --> 01:45:37.687]  They tried to fry it and it missed a little and burned a hole in his gut so he was bleeding, you know?
[01:45:37.807 --> 01:45:38.487]  That's how it works!
[01:45:38.808 --> 01:45:47.552]  Well, you could just have a little particle beam right there and just have it shoot somebody once a day where they sit at their office desk and they're gonna be dead in a few months.
[01:45:47.572 --> 01:45:48.153]  $3,000 of equipment.
[01:45:48.173 --> 01:45:48.733]  I can build it right now.
[01:45:50.387 --> 01:45:51.007]  How'd you like that?
[01:45:51.308 --> 01:46:07.800]  See, start, and you don't see it, you don't hear it, you're sitting there, and it goes, and you're just kind of, you don't even feel it, you're just kind of, you're psychosomatic, it's kind of like nauseous, like, oh, I'm kind of, your nerves, your brain's going, I don't like this, I'm agitated, I'm agitated, that's why you're in 5G, you're pissed!
[01:46:08.181 --> 01:46:16.287]  That's why people are getting angry, and suicides are exploding, because they're hitting us with electromagnetic radiation!
[01:46:20.836 --> 01:46:24.679]  Man, I like to go out in the country where there's no cell phone range.
[01:46:25.259 --> 01:46:28.401]  I'm trying to find a place behind a hill or something just because hills will block it.
[01:46:28.681 --> 01:46:30.382]  You want to live where your cell phone don't work?
[01:46:32.024 --> 01:46:33.725]  And you want to talk about big business in the future?
[01:46:34.285 --> 01:46:40.409]  If I wanted money, I would just be setting up communities that don't have RF in them by law.
[01:46:41.350 --> 01:46:45.633]  High-level RF, like they have in West Virginia in a secret government program that's now declassified.
[01:46:46.804 --> 01:46:47.625]  Yes, I agree with your calls.
[01:46:47.745 --> 01:46:48.885]  Just please listen to me, folks.
[01:46:49.365 --> 01:46:49.926]  I love you, man.
[01:46:49.986 --> 01:46:51.306]  I'm not lying to you about any of this.
[01:46:51.687 --> 01:46:53.568]  I don't say all this stuff to scare you, man.
[01:46:53.928 --> 01:47:07.195]  That's why I can have former top CIA people and former governors and, you know, the president and former top, you know, authors of the biological weapons treaties on, and they're all like, you're absolutely right, you're absolutely right, because it's true!
[01:47:07.215 --> 01:47:09.196]  This is insane!
[01:47:12.059 --> 01:47:15.721]  The vaccine doesn't exist for the common flu.
[01:47:16.242 --> 01:47:19.924]  Coronavirus is weaponized common cold.
[01:47:20.484 --> 01:47:21.805]  That vaccine doesn't exist.
[01:47:21.885 --> 01:47:23.726]  All right, I'm gonna play a short compilation.
[01:47:24.867 --> 01:47:25.887]  It's like 20 minutes long.
[01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:33.172]  By the way, put that photo back up.
[01:47:34.813 --> 01:47:36.594]  The town without Wi-Fi, that's another article.
[01:47:38.863 --> 01:47:47.810]  Why do you think there's no Wi-Fi and no radios allowed and the police pull you over if they see it and explain to you the law and the federal government's regulations?
[01:47:48.490 --> 01:47:49.711]  It's like 8,000 square miles.
[01:47:51.133 --> 01:47:51.853]  Why do you think that?
[01:47:52.213 --> 01:47:54.355]  Well, you see, there is one antenna allowed.
[01:47:54.375 --> 01:47:55.276]  You see that guy?
[01:47:56.377 --> 01:47:57.858]  It's talking to the aliens.
[01:47:59.139 --> 01:48:04.303]  You don't think when they get the little transmissions that they're going to tell you they ever got communications from them, right?
[01:48:06.124 --> 01:48:08.466]  By the way, they admit that's what that is right there.
[01:48:10.168 --> 01:48:13.249]  That's one of the SETI dishes in West Virginia.
[01:48:15.631 --> 01:48:17.772]  And by the way, they get transmissions all the time and it leaks.
[01:48:17.792 --> 01:48:19.472]  They're like, oh, well, just don't worry about that.
[01:48:19.492 --> 01:48:20.333]  Just don't worry about that.
[01:48:20.353 --> 01:48:21.213]  Don't worry about that.
[01:48:21.233 --> 01:48:23.314]  What type of nice fellers do you think are sending those transmissions?
[01:48:23.794 --> 01:48:29.477]  Ever seen that cheesy movie, Species, where they go, oh, we got a transmission to SETI.
[01:48:29.797 --> 01:48:31.718]  It told us how to genetically engineer this thing.
[01:48:32.799 --> 01:48:34.980]  And they do it and it jumps out and tries to take over.
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:35.900]  Really?
[01:48:36.941 --> 01:48:37.601]  Think so, huh?
[01:48:39.366 --> 01:49:01.334]  Here's the deal, if the government doesn't want you to have that, so they can have a transmitter that can pick up these faint transmissions, because in the electromagnetic field, every one of these devices sounds like a chainsaw going up against a chalkboard.
[01:49:02.435 --> 01:49:07.917]  It's bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, and your cells are hearing it.
[01:49:11.403 --> 01:49:12.284]  And what does that do?
[01:49:12.304 --> 01:49:13.404]  What does a microwave do?
[01:49:13.484 --> 01:49:16.186]  It rattles molecules and creates friction.
[01:49:17.106 --> 01:49:19.768]  And when you do that, it heats up and it breaks DNA strands.
[01:49:20.308 --> 01:49:21.689]  So you are being killed.
[01:49:21.909 --> 01:49:22.730]  I am being killed.
[01:49:24.030 --> 01:49:27.673]  If I was a selfish person, I'd take the little bit of money I got and run.
[01:49:30.674 --> 01:49:30.955]  Because
[01:49:32.170 --> 01:49:35.432]  Almost everybody's gonna be herded into the cities now, and you're all gonna die.
[01:49:35.752 --> 01:49:38.234]  And it's just gonna be, well, there's new viruses doing it.
[01:49:38.734 --> 01:49:43.438]  Oh, people are dying from the common cold now, because your immune system is gone!
[01:49:44.338 --> 01:49:51.903]  Instead of injecting you with HIV that attacks your immune system, they kill it with RF and microwaves, and then you die.
[01:49:54.465 --> 01:50:01.230]  Because when you're debilitated, and when you're emasculated, and when you don't have the nutrients and your cells can't rebuild, you die of malnutrition.
[01:50:02.452 --> 01:50:05.613]  Which is not having the vitamins and minerals that are essential.
[01:50:08.474 --> 01:50:09.974]  And what does your loving media say?
[01:50:11.475 --> 01:50:12.555]  There is no hope.
[01:50:13.435 --> 01:50:14.435]  You do not need zinc.
[01:50:14.915 --> 01:50:20.997]  You do not need vitamin C. You do not need any of the vitamin D. You do not need sunlight.
[01:50:21.357 --> 01:50:24.258]  And the leftists are all gobbling it while they write.
[01:50:24.458 --> 01:50:25.318]  Don't listen to Jones!
[01:50:25.338 --> 01:50:26.159]  Don't listen to him!
[01:50:26.299 --> 01:50:26.699]  It's evil!
[01:50:26.719 --> 01:50:27.139]  Don't take it!
[01:50:28.297 --> 01:50:30.059]  Because they're told to do that.
[01:50:30.239 --> 01:50:31.660]  Can you imagine the level?
[01:50:32.401 --> 01:50:36.404]  They won't walk up with a gun and bang, shoot you in the head like that.
[01:50:36.524 --> 01:50:39.267]  No, they do it by going, oh no.
[01:50:40.988 --> 01:50:45.653]  You need white flour and GMO and you need vaccines.
[01:50:45.693 --> 01:50:46.573]  That'll keep you safe.
[01:50:47.094 --> 01:50:50.056]  Even though every study shows vaccines lower immunity to everything else.
[01:50:51.084 --> 01:50:55.007]  They might help you with the thing sometimes that you're trying to fight.
[01:50:55.087 --> 01:50:57.488]  It's true, but they lower the immunity.
[01:50:57.749 --> 01:51:07.956]  Type in, Canadian study, flu, those vaccinated for the flu have a 50% chance of getting the flu, a 50% increased chance of getting the flu the next year.
[01:51:07.976 --> 01:51:09.296]  That was a study 10 years ago.
[01:51:09.316 --> 01:51:12.038]  All right, I'm going to play part of this compilation and go to your calls.
[01:51:12.058 --> 01:51:17.642]  15 times Alex Jones predicted the bio attack being used to bring in worldwide tyranny.
[01:51:17.862 --> 01:51:20.184]  Like the film, Endgame Blueprint for Global Enslavement,
[01:51:21.428 --> 01:51:24.851]  Which says they'll use a bio-attack controlled and lock you down and have drones controlling you.
[01:51:25.131 --> 01:51:27.233]  Because they said they were going to do this.
[01:51:27.493 --> 01:51:27.874]  Here it is.
[01:51:30.776 --> 01:51:31.337]  Very dramatic.
[01:51:34.239 --> 01:51:37.642]  Can you imagine the awakening that's going to happen if they release those bio-weapons?
[01:51:38.403 --> 01:51:39.704]  After we've warned people so much?
[01:51:39.784 --> 01:51:44.108]  God Almighty, I hope the next phases of what we've broken down don't happen.
[01:51:44.648 --> 01:51:46.390]  God Almighty, I hope they don't.
[01:51:51.721 --> 01:51:57.283]  Biological and radiological agents on unsuspecting populations continues worldwide today.
[01:51:58.223 --> 01:52:10.187]  From 1940 to 1979, the vast majority of the British population was sprayed by aircraft more than 2,000 times with deadly chemicals and microorganisms without ever being told.
[01:52:11.928 --> 01:52:20.371]  In 1968, the Pentagon tested a deadly bioweapon on New York subways and placed personnel in local hospitals to monitor the effects.
[01:52:22.418 --> 01:52:27.159]  Aggressive sterilization of men and women continued in many states until the mid-1980s.
[01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:42.163]  In the draft copy of the United Nations Global Biodiversity Assessment, it states very clearly that we must reduce the human population from what's current level of about 6 billion people down to about 1 billion people.
[01:52:43.166 --> 01:52:43.426]  Hello, Alex.
[01:52:43.466 --> 01:52:43.706]  Welcome.
[01:53:10.554 --> 01:53:15.957]  I wanted to ask you a question about the race-specific bioweapons.
[01:53:16.497 --> 01:53:30.525]  You had mentioned in the past about meetings that have been going on and been taking place behind the closed doors about what they're planning, like with the 12-year world's-gonna-end scenario and all that.
[01:53:32.090 --> 01:53:50.690]  Well, they're introducing into the cultural cosmology that humans are bad, deserve to die, and they're creating a race narrative to hate ourselves and not have a life force or a survival instinct, to invert that instinct into an anti-human loathing, to accept the mass culling as a prophecy when it begins to take place.
[01:53:51.090 --> 01:53:54.113]  Hence, AOC being told to say there'll be no humans in 12 years.
[01:53:55.094 --> 01:54:07.038]  And so that is on the drawing board in some of their previous blueprints, would be exterminate 98% of humanity by 2030, which would be less than 12 years, 11 years.
[01:54:07.538 --> 01:54:11.279]  Those are different blueprints that David Rockefeller and others have publicly talked about.
[01:54:12.679 --> 01:54:15.900]  Prince Charles' father has talked a lot about it.
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:16.480]  Prince Philip.
[01:54:17.301 --> 01:54:18.741]  Ted Turner's talked a lot about it.
[01:54:18.861 --> 01:54:19.862]  That's in their blueprint.
[01:54:20.262 --> 01:54:22.923]  And then, yes, they've had race-specific bioweapons for a long time.
[01:54:24.143 --> 01:54:31.686]  That, say, you can release a weapon that'll kill, 98% is usually the top with these weapons of the blacks.
[01:54:32.986 --> 01:54:34.707]  So they've got bioweapons that are tailored for blacks.
[01:54:35.826 --> 01:54:43.476]  Um, but the problem is everybody also has some of the same basic genetics, so you'd still probably get 5-10% of northern Europeans would die.
[01:54:43.496 --> 01:54:47.241]  And of course, I'm not for killing any of the blacks, but you see the whole extermination program with the abortion.
[01:54:47.481 --> 01:54:50.525]  Somebody calls in about something like race-specific bioweapons.
[01:54:52.549 --> 01:54:54.411]  And it's bad to kill any group or race of people.
[01:54:54.992 --> 01:54:59.618]  But the problem of the people that produce the weapons is, humans are all interrelated.
[01:55:00.339 --> 01:55:04.424]  So you might tailor a weapon that'll kill the majority of one group, but it'll also kill a bunch of your group.
[01:55:04.845 --> 01:55:06.767]  It's kind of like nerve gas.
[01:55:06.787 --> 01:55:09.971]  You can fire it at your enemy, but if the wind changes, it comes and gets you.
[01:55:11.015 --> 01:55:14.397]  That's why the globalists have all built these big underground bases so they'll survive during this.
[01:55:14.998 --> 01:55:25.305]  And their main plan, you see it in James Bond movies like Moonraker and things, written by MI6, Ian Fleming, is that they're going to release a bioweapon and call the population to save the Earth.
[01:55:25.946 --> 01:55:32.070]  And they're kind of doing it through the vaccines, through the GMOs, through the food, all of it is kind of culling us now.
[01:55:36.843 --> 01:55:42.524]  South Africa developed them, Israel has developed them, the UK has developed them, the US has developed them as of 50 years ago.
[01:55:43.164 --> 01:55:44.885]  Other countries have undoubtedly developed them.
[01:55:44.905 --> 01:55:46.265]  You know the Chinese have developed them.
[01:55:48.586 --> 01:56:00.188]  And so it's kind of a mutually assured destruction situation and we should do a whole show sometime on race-specific bioweapons and the really advanced weapons that are out there because that's an issue that people should discuss.
[01:56:00.589 --> 01:56:02.209]  But we just sit here and
[01:56:03.700 --> 01:56:17.252]  Have the elite, so-called elite in Silicon Valley and the UN and everywhere, saying there are too many people, we need a world government to forcibly reduce the population's numbers.
[01:56:17.813 --> 01:56:26.781]  But first you want to flood the first world with the giant bloom of the third world to bring the first world down, then you release a bio-weapon
[01:56:28.456 --> 01:56:57.148]  That culls large amounts of the population and you tell them that it's a naturally occurring weapon or the terrorists released it and then everybody's got to go into these highly controlled compact police state grid cities for their quote safety and then that allows over time the social engineering to get even more draconian and then basically they'll release bioweapons so deadly that only becoming basically artificial humans will allow you to live in the new environment that they are creating.
[01:56:57.868 --> 01:57:01.211]  And I'm not going to sit here and worry about me.
[01:57:01.952 --> 01:57:03.694]  I'll do okay no matter what happens.
[01:57:03.974 --> 01:57:11.821]  But you think about everybody else with this control system, a bunch of followers, with a system that's going to totally control their life and tell them what they can say and what they can do.
[01:57:11.861 --> 01:57:18.127]  And then the end game of these people is horrible control and enslavement and dumbing down for social engineering.
[01:57:19.756 --> 01:57:24.319]  If you think people are dumb and evil and stupid now, you haven't seen anything yet!
[01:57:24.699 --> 01:57:36.145]  If you think devil worshippers all over the news saying we're gonna come to your school and talk to your kids whether you like it or not is bad, and we're gonna kill babies after they're born, if you think that's bad in 2019, Bubba, you ain't seen nothing yet!
[01:57:38.267 --> 01:57:43.770]  Because before the globalists can release the bioweapons, God has to remove his protection.
[01:57:47.126 --> 01:57:53.251]  Oh, the devil would nuke this planet in 10 seconds if God removed his protection.
[01:57:53.892 --> 01:57:57.034]  And God is gonna remove the protection, but for one hour.
[01:57:58.395 --> 01:58:00.577]  One hour, and we're gonna be ready before it happens.
[01:58:01.538 --> 01:58:09.705]  I went and saw Godzilla last night, and for a cheesy Godzilla movie, it's the best Godzilla movie I ever saw.
[01:58:10.705 --> 01:58:13.688]  Spoiler alert, because of the plot.
[01:58:15.586 --> 01:58:17.427]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:58:17.547 --> 01:58:18.668]  That's what you're going to be watching.
[01:58:21.309 --> 01:58:34.857]  Environmental terrorists, 12 monkeys type, want to release these dormant titans to destroy humans and save the earth.
[01:58:38.499 --> 01:58:39.000]  It's incredible.
[01:58:40.106 --> 01:58:54.911]  And the environmental terrorists want to release radiation that'll kill humans, but they believe re-green the Earth, which is something that modern leftists now say, oh, we didn't like nuclear power before, but now we're for it because it'll kill humans.
[01:58:55.891 --> 01:58:58.992]  That's main line top leftists.
[01:59:02.625 --> 01:59:23.816]  So when you go see this, ladies and gentlemen, you are literally being prepared and programmed for mass bioweapon plagues, collapse of civilization, you name it, and that you deserve it, and it's the right thing to do, because there was an ancient Atlantean civilization that was also destroyed because it got out of balance.
[01:59:28.999 --> 01:59:30.860]  And so aliens attacked the Earth,
[01:59:32.352 --> 01:59:33.553]  To wipe out humanity.
[01:59:34.774 --> 01:59:40.579]  But then Godzilla, this archetype of the Earth, of the Earth Spirit, stood up and resisted it.
[01:59:41.140 --> 01:59:44.683]  But Godzilla might have to come back and kill the humans, they tell you at the end of the movie.
[01:59:45.463 --> 01:59:46.844]  We're very lucky God's forgiving.
[01:59:48.146 --> 01:59:52.709]  Because the amount of evil coming out of this planet right now is unbelievable.
[01:59:52.910 --> 01:59:54.851]  But Satan knows what he's doing.
[01:59:55.912 --> 01:59:57.814]  He wants God to remove the hedge of protection.
[02:00:00.034 --> 02:00:07.517]  And that's why we've got to fight the evil, we've got to stop the evil, and we've got to just keep letting God know, we know this is wrong, please don't kill us and our children.
[02:00:07.757 --> 02:00:10.058]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:00:10.078 --> 02:00:15.880]  When you've got this kind of stuff going on, wide scale, man, bad stuff historically starts happening real quick.
[02:00:16.781 --> 02:00:19.862]  Like a plague that's going to kill billions, or a nuclear war.
[02:00:19.942 --> 02:00:20.482]  And you know what?
[02:00:20.982 --> 02:00:22.603]  At the end of the day, here's what's getting sick.
[02:00:22.863 --> 02:00:24.083]  I've got four children, I love them.
[02:00:24.664 --> 02:00:25.124]  More than life.
[02:00:26.471 --> 02:00:29.773]  I'm starting to just think God ought to blow the whole planet up, you know what I mean?
[02:00:30.894 --> 02:00:33.416]  So that we're not just a factory to kill a bunch more kids.
[02:00:35.737 --> 02:00:42.421]  Because if we're just going to be a factory to have little babies so child molesters can rape them and torture the hell out of them, then you know what?
[02:00:42.461 --> 02:00:50.927]  Just blow it all up, God, because I don't want to be part of this, and I don't want to be aiding and abetting it, because I can't figure out how to stop it.
[02:00:51.327 --> 02:00:53.729]  I was talking to the crew during the break about the depopulation plan.
[02:00:55.292 --> 02:00:59.353]  And why at first they allowed the population to bloom, but then later they're gonna wipe it all out.
[02:00:59.433 --> 02:01:12.017]  And I was explaining, different State Department memorandums explaining this, that quote the Royal Commission on Population, commissioned for his Royal Highness in England in 1949.
[02:01:12.357 --> 02:01:16.998]  National Security Study Memorandum 200, Henry Kissinger, 1975, not declassified until 1992.
[02:01:23.775 --> 02:01:25.817]  And let me just explain to folks again.
[02:01:26.457 --> 02:01:28.959]  I don't just sit up here and say all this stuff, okay?
[02:01:29.959 --> 02:01:31.981]  And the plan is so diabolical.
[02:01:34.343 --> 02:01:35.243]  So diabolical.
[02:01:36.484 --> 02:01:48.633]  Keep the third world dumb, don't industrialize them, then let their population balloon, and then weaponize them against the West, but then dump your toxic waste and stuff down there,
[02:01:50.936 --> 02:01:52.037]  Well, what if it continued to spread?
[02:01:52.077 --> 02:01:55.619]  What if it starts spreading outside of a hospital environment?
[02:01:55.639 --> 02:01:56.519]  What if it spreads
[02:02:16.297 --> 02:02:17.878]  In a migrant processing center.
[02:02:18.279 --> 02:02:20.280]  What if it spreads on the streets?
[02:02:20.800 --> 02:02:32.770]  The streets of San Francisco, the streets of Los Angeles that are already filthy places with almost no real hygiene going on and they're being abandoned, the homeless people are being abandoned there by
[02:02:33.450 --> 02:02:35.070]  You know, the Democrats in charge of those cities.
[02:02:35.491 --> 02:02:43.913]  If you get Ebola mixed in with those kinds of environments, you probably cannot stop it without extreme medical... Alright, folks.
[02:02:44.133 --> 02:02:46.673]  By the way, I have a good crew, but they're overworked.
[02:02:47.794 --> 02:03:01.137]  And so I said on air that the first person to get us a compilation of me talking about controlled bioweapons releases bringing in world government will get a big cash payment.
[02:03:02.594 --> 02:03:04.275]  Now, I can't do this in the future at the level.
[02:03:04.315 --> 02:03:06.095]  I just said $10,000, I'll give it to you.
[02:03:06.115 --> 02:03:10.476]  But since I said I'd do it with this one guy, I said I would choose the best one that was sent in.
[02:03:10.696 --> 02:03:12.397]  Only guy that sends something in, you get $10,000.
[02:03:12.437 --> 02:03:14.718]  But I'm going to try to hire this person.
[02:03:14.758 --> 02:03:16.638]  He went out on the internet and found this stuff quickly.
[02:03:17.138 --> 02:03:19.439]  Not at that level, because I did say that.
[02:03:21.482 --> 02:03:25.704]  To hire him, I guess, as an archivist to go through all the things we've said that come true exactly.
[02:03:25.724 --> 02:03:31.087]  Because I've even been way more specific than all of what he found, and that's not the whole video.
[02:03:31.107 --> 02:03:31.867]  There's like 10 more minutes of it.
[02:03:31.907 --> 02:03:34.688]  I don't want to go to your phone calls now on this live Saturday edition.
[02:03:35.469 --> 02:03:40.691]  But Sean Miller, yeah, Rob Doo is going to be calling you, and you got a job, buddy.
[02:03:43.572 --> 02:03:44.853]  Because it's vital.
[02:03:44.913 --> 02:03:46.574]  The sheeple wake up.
[02:03:48.134 --> 02:03:55.860]  When people show them videos of me saying, within two months they're going to blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on Bin Laden and launch a worldwide system and set up a police state here in America.
[02:03:57.001 --> 02:04:06.749]  And then, decades after that, they'll have a bioweapon release, and then the general public will be under martial law, what they thought was the fight Islam, and they'll use Muslims to then invade the United States.
[02:04:08.651 --> 02:04:11.714]  And man, I don't just say random stuff and then some of it comes true.
[02:04:11.874 --> 02:04:12.754]  It all came true, didn't it?
[02:04:16.536 --> 02:04:21.001]  That's why they saw our YouTube channel with 3 billion views and the other channels 5 billion total.
[02:04:21.762 --> 02:04:24.345]  Just on our channels, not mentioning everybody else posting them.
[02:04:25.005 --> 02:04:26.467]  And they're like, you gotta get this guy off.
[02:04:26.487 --> 02:04:29.691]  He's like Fiona Hills and Soros agent and this guy's one.
[02:04:29.731 --> 02:04:34.236]  I'm not trying to act tough here, but I know there were discussions about having to kill.
[02:04:35.228 --> 02:04:35.949]  I'll just leave it at that.
[02:04:36.569 --> 02:04:48.198]  But they know that the other groups of the Pentagon and CIA have overwatched on Infowars and have stopped me from being killed because the globalists know they kill me, it'll be a little too obvious.
[02:04:48.238 --> 02:04:53.522]  But I can tell you right now, they got their finger on the trigger.
[02:05:01.289 --> 02:05:01.849]  And you know what?
[02:05:01.889 --> 02:05:02.830]  I'm not scared at all.
[02:05:06.172 --> 02:05:07.013]  I'm not at all, man.
[02:05:11.155 --> 02:05:12.235]  I'll never commit suicide.
[02:05:12.255 --> 02:05:14.917]  I don't want to die, but I got to be honest with you.
[02:05:16.438 --> 02:05:21.900]  Stuff's going to get worse and worse in the next 10, 20 years, and you're all got front row seats to hell.
[02:05:23.473 --> 02:05:25.234]  So let me just give you a little newsflash.
[02:05:25.334 --> 02:05:50.828]  You better decide to fight evil and have a purpose in life and not roll over and just go along with the system because you're going to be going along with stuff that's going to get so evil that you're not even going to know how to respond and then you're going to be so far gone that you're going to openly pledge yourself to the world government system and then you're going to have to openly endorse pedophilia and engage in it.
[02:05:51.735 --> 02:06:01.446]  And you're going to have to openly support euthanizing the old and others, and then you'll finally have to support killing large segments of the healthy population.
[02:06:01.726 --> 02:06:02.847]  That's in all the UN documents.
[02:06:03.748 --> 02:06:05.971]  They even talk about bringing back child sacrifice.
[02:06:08.333 --> 02:06:10.015]  But now you see the Democrats are on TV going,
[02:06:14.565 --> 02:06:15.305]  My son or daughter.
[02:06:15.586 --> 02:06:16.286]  Oh, so good.
[02:06:16.306 --> 02:06:29.093]  I mean, we've played those clips here and I don't play them a lot because I don't like listening to them because it makes me, you know, makes me want to hurt people and that would let them shut down my mission.
[02:06:31.494 --> 02:06:37.398]  I'm the one that's going to get hurt, but they're going to get it spiritually.
[02:06:38.504 --> 02:06:39.264]  That's how it works.
[02:06:39.364 --> 02:06:40.305]  We are not Christ.
[02:06:40.385 --> 02:06:41.345]  We must be Christ-like.
[02:06:41.786 --> 02:06:43.006]  Lord knows I'm not like Christ.
[02:06:45.087 --> 02:06:49.810]  But... You want to really hurt these people.
[02:06:49.870 --> 02:06:52.431]  Stop caring what the sheep think and start telling the truth.
[02:06:52.491 --> 02:06:54.512]  And I'm going to say what I should have said at the very start of the broadcast.
[02:06:57.954 --> 02:07:04.577]  I cannot tell you how important it is that you tell everyone you know about this show and about the feeds and about everything.
[02:07:04.737 --> 02:07:06.218]  You can now see how real all this is.
[02:07:07.995 --> 02:07:13.787]  I mean, I know it's all real too, but now we're not just talking about what's happening and knowing we're right about it.
[02:07:14.148 --> 02:07:14.809]  They're doing it.
[02:07:15.070 --> 02:07:16.212]  They're making the move, okay?
[02:07:16.232 --> 02:07:16.292]  And...
[02:07:19.659 --> 02:07:21.820]  We're here for the spiritual test of this.
[02:07:22.301 --> 02:07:24.322]  You're gonna wake up just like that in your new body, folks.
[02:07:24.962 --> 02:07:28.865]  And like, awareness, next level, God's like, I can trust you now.
[02:07:29.385 --> 02:07:31.346]  Here's a trillion times the power you had.
[02:07:31.366 --> 02:07:32.067]  And you're not gonna want it.
[02:07:32.107 --> 02:07:33.508]  You're gonna be like, oh, let me just serve you.
[02:07:33.528 --> 02:07:35.009]  God's gonna go, no!
[02:07:35.509 --> 02:07:38.971]  That new war, and it's gonna be, I've seen it, believe me.
[02:07:39.332 --> 02:07:40.112]  I'm just gonna leave it at that.
[02:07:40.432 --> 02:07:41.733]  You think you've seen stuff, folks?
[02:07:41.753 --> 02:07:42.594]  This is nothing.
[02:07:42.634 --> 02:07:44.315]  This is a sandbox.
[02:07:46.345 --> 02:07:51.629]  The minute you get jacked into the next level, it's going to be, you can't even, the human mind can't even compute it.
[02:07:52.089 --> 02:07:54.151]  I try to even compute the stuff God showed me.
[02:07:54.871 --> 02:07:57.813]  All these people claim visions, this, that, most of it's crap.
[02:07:58.354 --> 02:07:59.394]  Let me just give you a little newsflash.
[02:08:00.075 --> 02:08:04.318]  I've seen a bunch of levels up without drugs.
[02:08:05.679 --> 02:08:08.061]  That's why you'll never catch me taking DMT or any of it.
[02:08:11.601 --> 02:08:16.807]  And I just feel sorry for the Satanists and people thinking they're getting occult advanced knowledge by getting into evil.
[02:08:16.927 --> 02:08:18.889]  All you get is twisted knowledge at this level.
[02:08:19.129 --> 02:08:19.710]  It's a joke.
[02:08:20.651 --> 02:08:27.017]  You serve God and stand up because God hates cowards and have courage and spiritual courage, then it's not been fun.
[02:08:31.482 --> 02:08:32.663]  It's not fun facing evil.
[02:08:32.703 --> 02:08:34.145]  I can tell you it stinks, literally.
[02:08:35.595 --> 02:08:38.737]  But you face it, then God, you get promoted.
[02:08:38.757 --> 02:08:39.638]  It's just like that.
[02:08:40.158 --> 02:08:42.720]  And then, it's incredible.
[02:08:43.421 --> 02:08:46.703]  And that's why I'd tell you 10 years ago that I wasn't gonna tell you a lot of stuff I knew.
[02:08:47.204 --> 02:08:51.126]  And now, it's time to start talking about those things.
[02:08:51.267 --> 02:08:52.808]  And notice, the globalists aren't laughing.
[02:08:52.868 --> 02:08:54.809]  They're crying when we're talking about this.
[02:08:55.149 --> 02:08:57.031]  They're like, shut him down.
[02:08:57.571 --> 02:08:58.492]  Shut that off.
[02:08:58.512 --> 02:09:01.494]  And they're like, well, we've computed if we kill him, it'll make it worse.
[02:09:01.534 --> 02:09:02.475]  Well, just kill his name.
[02:09:04.019 --> 02:09:06.002]  Or put him under pressure so he destroys himself.
[02:09:07.284 --> 02:09:08.546]  Listen, here's how this works.
[02:09:08.926 --> 02:09:10.468]  I've turned myself over to God.
[02:09:11.249 --> 02:09:12.531]  And God's in command of me.
[02:09:12.772 --> 02:09:16.717]  I'm weak and pathetic and a joke, but my spirit's being directed.
[02:09:17.839 --> 02:09:20.363]  And so, whatever you do is going to fail.
[02:09:21.578 --> 02:09:22.178]  You understand that?
[02:09:22.919 --> 02:09:34.364]  Doesn't mean my body or my name is going to be victorious, but our mission and the information we've put out, thanks to God, has already wrecked your globalist, Satanist ass!
[02:09:38.226 --> 02:09:38.946]  And that's what I'm saying.
[02:09:39.286 --> 02:09:40.227]  All right, I'm going to take these calls.
[02:09:40.247 --> 02:09:41.027]  The crew, get out of here.
[02:09:44.108 --> 02:09:47.330]  Trump is talking right now, and we'll analyze that.
[02:09:47.370 --> 02:09:49.191]  We've got articles up with the live feed of that as well.
[02:09:50.765 --> 02:09:52.786]  I like the fact that he said, no, we're not going to wear a mask.
[02:09:52.826 --> 02:09:54.567]  But he's trying to hold back the hysteria.
[02:09:55.227 --> 02:10:01.610]  But then he'll get blamed for every death if they don't.
[02:10:01.630 --> 02:10:03.551]  It's just like the school shootings when they blame gun owners.
[02:10:03.751 --> 02:10:05.291]  I say this all the time because it's so key.
[02:10:05.692 --> 02:10:10.394]  You're not going to stop bad people with baseball bats, knives, cars, guns, poison, whatever it is hurting innocent people.
[02:10:10.434 --> 02:10:10.814]  They're evil.
[02:10:11.494 --> 02:10:13.255]  You got to have good people with guns to counter them.
[02:10:13.795 --> 02:10:15.456]  Good people with baseball bats to counter them.
[02:10:16.547 --> 02:10:21.599]  It's like when a crazy guy's trying to run people over down the highway and trying to run and the cops ran their car into them.
[02:10:21.660 --> 02:10:23.965]  It's a good guy in a car stopping the bad guy in a car.
[02:10:24.964 --> 02:10:32.068]  And I'll just tell the police, I've tried to be friendly and tried to play the good cop to get police to see the globalist program.
[02:10:32.388 --> 02:10:37.971]  But they've just programmed police now where they just follow orders where you become robots yourselves or you get fired.
[02:10:38.031 --> 02:10:38.371]  I get it.
[02:10:38.752 --> 02:10:41.053]  You as unions should buck that and stop that.
[02:10:41.313 --> 02:10:44.254]  We need human intelligence in charge of things with your discretion.
[02:10:45.015 --> 02:10:46.876]  I do trust the average police officer's discretion.
[02:10:46.936 --> 02:10:47.716]  They don't have it anymore.
[02:10:49.097 --> 02:10:50.798]  And we're just screwed seven ways this Sunday.
[02:10:50.838 --> 02:10:52.779]  But just what matters is getting close to God.
[02:10:53.279 --> 02:10:54.220]  Get up under God's wings.
[02:10:56.394 --> 02:10:57.295]  But I'll tell you one thing.
[02:10:57.375 --> 02:10:58.196]  God hates cowards.
[02:10:59.317 --> 02:11:04.662]  And if people really want to experience stuff, you've got to get in the face of the enemy.
[02:11:05.043 --> 02:11:06.344]  And most people just can't handle it.
[02:11:06.424 --> 02:11:07.105]  They go crazy.
[02:11:07.966 --> 02:11:08.887]  They destroy themselves.
[02:11:10.628 --> 02:11:13.071]  And that's just the way it is.
[02:11:15.543 --> 02:11:18.244]  But Trump has certainly stood the test so far.
[02:11:19.045 --> 02:11:20.485]  He can only get done what he can get done.
[02:11:21.146 --> 02:11:22.566]  Our weakness is his weakness.
[02:11:22.947 --> 02:11:26.568]  The fact that he said, let's just face this and deal with it, whatever it is, we can handle it.
[02:11:27.009 --> 02:11:28.589]  We're like, no, we want diapers!
[02:11:28.629 --> 02:11:29.830]  Change our poopy diapers!
[02:11:30.430 --> 02:11:32.111]  And, yeah, it's your fault!
[02:11:32.832 --> 02:11:34.032]  We love GG Ping!
[02:11:34.432 --> 02:11:36.513]  Trump goes, okay, okay, we'll shut down two weeks.
[02:11:36.553 --> 02:11:37.514]  We want more!
[02:11:37.754 --> 02:11:38.895]  We want more!
[02:11:41.296 --> 02:11:42.436]  That's on All Americans Act!
[02:11:42.696 --> 02:11:43.357]  Yes, it is!
[02:11:44.485 --> 02:11:45.166]  Your fault!
[02:11:45.186 --> 02:11:46.207]  We love Gigi Ping!
[02:11:48.569 --> 02:11:50.151]  So, what are you gonna do?
[02:11:50.171 --> 02:11:51.593]  Alright, let's take a bunch of calls and get out of here.
[02:11:55.577 --> 02:11:59.261]  Dr. Pandian in Los Angeles, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:12:00.142 --> 02:12:01.283]  Hello, hi Alex.
[02:12:01.483 --> 02:12:03.145]  Thank you for doing awesome job.
[02:12:03.729 --> 02:12:08.871]  And thank God that Trump is in the White House and you're doing what you're doing.
[02:12:09.331 --> 02:12:11.291]  I just want to talk about a few things.
[02:12:11.712 --> 02:12:21.215]  We need to call the White House and Congress to let them know to stop the 5G and also to rein in on this bioweapon labs.
[02:12:21.695 --> 02:12:24.836]  And also I had an encouraging thought that God is
[02:12:25.860 --> 02:12:27.901]  Uh, with us at this time.
[02:12:28.001 --> 02:12:36.303]  Thank you for sticking up with God and he's going to free us like the Israelites, even Pharaohs was pursuing through the Red Sea.
[02:12:36.763 --> 02:12:40.724]  God, uh, helped him, uh, uh, help the Israelites.
[02:12:40.784 --> 02:12:42.104]  So he's going to do it.
[02:12:42.264 --> 02:12:44.905]  I think Trump is the new Moses for us.
[02:12:46.705 --> 02:12:47.605]  Moses really is.
[02:12:47.625 --> 02:12:50.226]  Uh, Trump really is a Moses archetype, isn't he?
[02:12:50.246 --> 02:12:51.306]  Speak more to that doctor.
[02:12:51.686 --> 02:12:51.906]  Yes.
[02:12:52.466 --> 02:12:53.467]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:12:53.547 --> 02:12:55.167]  He's at this time of the,
[02:12:55.646 --> 02:12:56.287]  I don't know.
[02:13:12.034 --> 02:13:21.199]  And just like Moses wasn't a nice guy or a perfect guy when he was young, he then found God, and he had been slipped into the elite household, just like Trump's not of the elite, but got into the elite.
[02:13:21.499 --> 02:13:24.481]  It's absolutely the Moses archetype, and that's how history works.
[02:13:24.541 --> 02:13:25.601]  It repeats over and over again.
[02:13:25.641 --> 02:13:30.344]  But Moses' problem was the Israelites were weak and wouldn't follow him.
[02:13:31.104 --> 02:13:31.824]  Same thing again.
[02:13:32.925 --> 02:13:33.525]  Exactly.
[02:13:33.565 --> 02:13:35.306]  We are in a similar situation.
[02:13:38.728 --> 02:13:39.348]  I agree with you.
[02:13:41.075 --> 02:13:41.715]  Making great points.
[02:13:41.755 --> 02:13:42.436]  Doctor, anything else?
[02:13:43.496 --> 02:13:43.696]  Nope.
[02:13:43.776 --> 02:13:44.456]  That will be all.
[02:13:44.496 --> 02:13:46.157]  Thank you for doing an awesome job.
[02:13:46.197 --> 02:13:46.737]  God bless.
[02:13:46.917 --> 02:13:47.458]  God bless you.
[02:13:47.558 --> 02:13:48.298]  I'm trying, man.
[02:13:48.318 --> 02:13:51.239]  I just... I just wish we didn't have to go through this.
[02:13:51.299 --> 02:13:52.300]  But, you know, we deserve it.
[02:13:52.380 --> 02:13:53.980]  And we've done a lot of bad... Oh, man.
[02:13:54.040 --> 02:13:56.641]  It's just... It's just horrible.
[02:13:57.202 --> 02:13:58.302]  We're in it now, folks.
[02:13:58.382 --> 02:13:59.543]  It's just gonna get worse from here.
[02:14:00.243 --> 02:14:04.885]  Until... World government, Antichrist, global extermination, and then...
[02:14:06.687 --> 02:14:09.009]  God says, well you had it your way, now you ready for me to do something?
[02:14:09.029 --> 02:14:12.892]  And it's going to be lights on, and the roaches are going to be running.
[02:14:18.977 --> 02:14:20.779]  Let's talk to X in California.
[02:14:20.879 --> 02:14:21.640]  X, thanks for calling.
[02:14:23.348 --> 02:14:24.509]  Hi Alex, how's it going?
[02:14:24.529 --> 02:14:32.213]  I spoke to you a couple weeks ago on Saturday to give you an update on some police activity information.
[02:14:32.233 --> 02:14:36.675]  I remember you called in dead on with the lockdowns the next Monday and how they were going to do it.
[02:14:36.695 --> 02:14:37.415]  You had great info.
[02:14:38.336 --> 02:14:45.239]  Yeah, well, I've got some really good intel this morning and from what the sheriffs are saying, they're planning on locking down
[02:14:46.621 --> 02:14:47.262]  For two weeks.
[02:14:47.642 --> 02:14:48.182]  Completely.
[02:14:48.402 --> 02:14:49.583]  You can't even leave your house.
[02:14:49.784 --> 02:14:51.325]  All businesses will be shut down.
[02:14:51.385 --> 02:14:54.227]  The grocery stores are going to be allowed to stock up one last time.
[02:14:54.247 --> 02:14:55.168]  That's right.
[02:14:55.188 --> 02:14:56.649]  They're training us for martial law.
[02:14:56.749 --> 02:14:57.730]  Nothing to do with the virus.
[02:14:57.750 --> 02:15:01.693]  They want us to absolutely... And then when California does that, they're going to go, Look!
[02:15:01.753 --> 02:15:02.874]  Trump's not doing it!
[02:15:03.134 --> 02:15:03.955]  It's his fault!
[02:15:05.353 --> 02:15:05.814]  Absolutely.
[02:15:05.834 --> 02:15:09.417]  California's the beta test for the rest of the country, as you've been saying for years.
[02:15:09.437 --> 02:15:13.380]  But elaborate on that, because you weren't BSing last time, and you were dead on, and of course that's coming.
[02:15:13.660 --> 02:15:14.902]  Total lockdown.
[02:15:14.942 --> 02:15:19.105]  And of course the CFR said two weeks ago, sorry, the lockdown's gonna get totaled.
[02:15:19.425 --> 02:15:20.927]  There'll be a period for at least a month.
[02:15:20.967 --> 02:15:21.888]  You can't leave your house.
[02:15:21.988 --> 02:15:22.668]  Sorry!
[02:15:23.049 --> 02:15:25.171]  And they're gonna have cops out trying to arrest people.
[02:15:25.551 --> 02:15:26.592]  And I'm not putting up with it.
[02:15:27.466 --> 02:15:29.407]  National Guard, they're saying, is going to be out.
[02:15:29.787 --> 02:15:30.867]  The sheriffs did say that.
[02:15:30.927 --> 02:15:33.828]  They're going to be mainly protecting businesses that are closed.
[02:15:34.388 --> 02:15:36.929]  I have a lot of surfer friends out here in Southern California.
[02:15:36.949 --> 02:15:40.850]  A lot of guys have been getting arrested, getting tickets, things like that, for going out in the ocean.
[02:15:40.910 --> 02:15:41.650]  It's ridiculous.
[02:15:42.711 --> 02:15:44.191]  I want to just quickly mention,
[02:15:44.811 --> 02:15:45.952]  We're good to go.
[02:16:04.941 --> 02:16:06.302]  It will build the antibodies.
[02:16:06.322 --> 02:16:08.403]  There's a thing called bioelectrification.
[02:16:08.763 --> 02:16:09.723]  You can look at the U.S.
[02:16:09.763 --> 02:16:11.204]  patents from 30 years ago.
[02:16:11.224 --> 02:16:15.005]  These two scientists in the patents proved that they could cure HIV.
[02:16:15.406 --> 02:16:16.406]  Well, let's go further.
[02:16:16.526 --> 02:16:21.188]  I mean, the sun, it's not just the vitamin D. It's what it does to your body, electrochemically.
[02:16:21.408 --> 02:16:22.509]  But let's go back to this.
[02:16:23.581 --> 02:16:28.486]  You were dead on to the day via the uniforms and who was supplying them and of course we can telegraph that too.
[02:16:28.506 --> 02:16:30.988]  We can see it's a rollout and it's going to be global.
[02:16:31.088 --> 02:16:35.993]  Australia, Russia, everywhere is going to try to see how much they can see us to put up with.
[02:16:36.053 --> 02:16:36.934]  Nothing to do with the virus.
[02:16:37.254 --> 02:16:37.975]  Trump's bucking it.
[02:16:38.115 --> 02:16:39.557]  It will create a depression here.
[02:16:40.017 --> 02:16:41.959]  Kissinger says it'll take generations to come back.
[02:16:42.279 --> 02:16:42.600]  Really?
[02:16:42.940 --> 02:16:46.043]  From something that hasn't killed what the flu does in the United States yet.
[02:16:46.283 --> 02:16:47.824]  Sure, it kills 200,000, 300,000, whatever.
[02:16:48.725 --> 02:16:52.007]  This is BS to say that we can't go out or whatever.
[02:16:52.587 --> 02:16:53.948]  It should be up to individuals.
[02:16:54.008 --> 02:16:54.909]  This is insane.
[02:16:54.969 --> 02:16:55.829]  What about poor people?
[02:16:55.949 --> 02:16:56.270]  All of us.
[02:16:56.530 --> 02:16:57.691]  It's going to cause civil unrest.
[02:16:57.911 --> 02:16:58.871]  That's why they're boarding everything up.
[02:16:59.212 --> 02:17:01.093]  Did the police think this was a good idea?
[02:17:01.113 --> 02:17:06.036]  Are they looking forward to the end of the country and depression and following the Democrats' orders?
[02:17:06.156 --> 02:17:09.959]  Because you notice, first, it's a two-week holiday, Gavin Newsom said.
[02:17:09.979 --> 02:17:11.500]  And I said, folks, that's the talking point.
[02:17:11.700 --> 02:17:12.641]  It's going to be months and months.
[02:17:12.821 --> 02:17:14.442]  They're just getting you used to increments.
[02:17:14.962 --> 02:17:16.103]  It's so evil.
[02:17:18.605 --> 02:17:19.526]  What do you think?
[02:17:19.726 --> 02:17:20.326]  What do they say?
[02:17:20.366 --> 02:17:21.847]  Are the cops looking forward to this?
[02:17:22.067 --> 02:17:22.708]  The end of the country?
[02:17:23.889 --> 02:17:32.035]  You know, the thing is, is some of them actually, the problem with the law enforcement is just like you said earlier, they're all just doing what they're told and they don't want to lose their jobs.
[02:17:32.055 --> 02:17:33.356]  They've got families to support.
[02:17:33.752 --> 02:17:34.992]  You know, they're not making a lot of money.
[02:17:35.032 --> 02:17:39.213]  Some of them are working overtime and making a ton of money, but they can't afford to lose their jobs.
[02:17:39.454 --> 02:17:41.374]  They're not trying to really cause chaos.
[02:17:41.394 --> 02:17:46.395]  The National Guard's really going to be the one protecting the closed businesses.
[02:17:46.415 --> 02:17:49.536]  The sheriffs are just going to be making sure that, you know, idiots aren't out there.
[02:17:50.457 --> 02:17:58.739]  But again, they are saying it's only two weeks, but my fear really is that, you know, how do we know that they can't extend this for two months or six months or 12 months or 18 months?
[02:18:00.694 --> 02:18:02.094]  Well, sir, they want 18 months.
[02:18:02.154 --> 02:18:04.075]  And if you do that, it'll be forever.
[02:18:04.415 --> 02:18:07.756]  And you're going to have apps, you'll be authorized, it's a carbon neutral program.
[02:18:08.117 --> 02:18:08.917]  It's their plan.
[02:18:09.157 --> 02:18:10.037]  There's no doubting it.
[02:18:10.357 --> 02:18:11.358]  Trump must beat this.
[02:18:11.438 --> 02:18:12.058]  We must beat it.
[02:18:12.098 --> 02:18:12.898]  We must say no.
[02:18:13.278 --> 02:18:14.579]  Everybody's got to call your governors.
[02:18:14.679 --> 02:18:17.420]  Everybody's got to say, we're not going to follow that.
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:19.440]  And they're going to say, you're the person that got people killed.
[02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:21.301]  No, your level four bioweapons labs did.
[02:18:21.641 --> 02:18:22.881]  Your forced inoculations did.
[02:18:22.921 --> 02:18:24.122]  Your lowered immune systems did.
[02:18:24.562 --> 02:18:26.903]  That's why they don't want chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine.
[02:18:26.923 --> 02:18:29.104]  That's why they don't want vitamin C or vitamin D3 out.
[02:18:29.324 --> 02:18:33.406]  That's why they don't want you to have that, because they don't want you prepared.
[02:18:33.446 --> 02:18:34.606]  They want maximum death.
[02:18:34.646 --> 02:18:35.206]  God bless you.
[02:18:35.527 --> 02:18:36.267]  Gotta move quick now.
[02:18:36.607 --> 02:18:38.168]  Let's go to Sarah in Sweden.
[02:18:38.188 --> 02:18:38.828]  Sarah, welcome.
[02:18:41.209 --> 02:18:41.709]  Hello, Alex.
[02:18:42.089 --> 02:18:42.830]  Hey, thanks for holding.
[02:18:42.850 --> 02:18:43.130]  Go ahead.
[02:18:45.691 --> 02:18:50.853]  You know, I've been listening to your show for like seven years, and this is my first time calling you.
[02:18:51.173 --> 02:18:51.893]  Well, thanks for calling.
[02:18:54.647 --> 02:19:00.108]  You know, this time God is really calling his army, yeah?
[02:19:01.549 --> 02:19:08.150]  And he's been calling me now, and I'm... Oh, by the way, can you feel the power of the Holy Spirit intensifying against this attack?
[02:19:08.250 --> 02:19:10.691]  To go out and expose it and not stand for it?
[02:19:11.531 --> 02:19:11.731]  Yeah.
[02:19:12.351 --> 02:19:16.992]  So this is why I'm calling, because he has given me a mission to fulfill, to give to you.
[02:19:17.012 --> 02:19:17.952]  Okay?
[02:19:21.373 --> 02:19:21.893]  And to Tom,
[02:19:22.518 --> 02:19:26.682]  And to all your soldiers, God's soldiers out there, okay?
[02:19:27.102 --> 02:19:27.622]  Are you listening?
[02:19:29.144 --> 02:19:29.684]  Yes, I'm listening.
[02:19:29.704 --> 02:19:30.925]  Don't cry, just tell us the message.
[02:19:31.846 --> 02:19:32.126]  Okay.
[02:19:32.907 --> 02:19:43.396]  You know, homeopathic remedies are curing the damage from fire weapons.
[02:19:50.970 --> 02:19:52.171]  Ma'am, go ahead and make your point.
[02:19:53.071 --> 02:19:54.212]  Yeah, that was the point.
[02:19:54.612 --> 02:19:54.932]  You know?
[02:19:55.273 --> 02:19:55.613]  Go ahead.
[02:19:55.633 --> 02:19:56.914]  I know I'm not mad at you.
[02:19:56.934 --> 02:20:00.676]  We can't have dead air because at the radio stations when there's dead air, alarms go off.
[02:20:00.696 --> 02:20:01.656]  Let me explain what happens.
[02:20:02.037 --> 02:20:05.759]  When we have like five seconds of dead air, alarms start going off at radio stations.
[02:20:05.779 --> 02:20:09.041]  So I don't want to talk over you, but I understand you're emotional.
[02:20:09.081 --> 02:20:09.581]  I am too.
[02:20:09.921 --> 02:20:13.784]  Just think about it, be hardcore about it, and tell us what you want to say.
[02:20:13.844 --> 02:20:14.304]  Okay, okay.
[02:20:14.884 --> 02:20:17.346]  So, we have the cure in front of our nose.
[02:20:17.955 --> 02:20:18.716]  It's tested.
[02:20:18.756 --> 02:20:34.029]  There's a huge network of classical homeopathy teaching now practicing homeopathy that's working together now all around the world to gather information from doctors and homeopaths and testing remedies.
[02:20:34.668 --> 02:20:35.749]  Right now, it's huge.
[02:20:36.009 --> 02:20:36.669]  It's more than 500.
[02:20:36.989 --> 02:20:38.630]  Oh, you're right.
[02:20:38.871 --> 02:20:43.693]  And they're trying to block everybody, talking about the fact that we have building blocks.
[02:20:43.753 --> 02:20:46.535]  When a vitamin or mineral says essential, it means you die without it.
[02:20:46.855 --> 02:20:49.717]  It means if you don't have what you need, you get sick and die.
[02:20:49.737 --> 02:20:54.620]  But Alex, it's not the same as supplements.
[02:20:54.920 --> 02:20:55.841]  They are not the same.
[02:20:56.081 --> 02:20:58.002]  This is medicine of God.
[02:20:59.628 --> 02:21:00.048]  I understand.
[02:21:00.209 --> 02:21:02.190]  Send me an email at ShowTipsInformers.com, sir.
[02:21:02.210 --> 02:21:04.472]  I really appreciate you calling from Sweden.
[02:21:04.492 --> 02:21:04.973]  God bless you.
[02:21:05.113 --> 02:21:06.074]  Got to move quick to get everybody.
[02:21:06.594 --> 02:21:07.895]  Let's talk to Chris in Kentucky.
[02:21:07.915 --> 02:21:08.656]  Chris, thanks for calling.
[02:21:08.676 --> 02:21:09.096]  You're on the air.
[02:21:10.077 --> 02:21:10.617]  Hey, Alex.
[02:21:10.818 --> 02:21:12.459]  I tell you what, I'm pumped up like you are.
[02:21:12.479 --> 02:21:16.122]  I just had an article out here in Louisville that- I recognize your voice.
[02:21:16.442 --> 02:21:18.084]  You've been calling, like, what, 18 years?
[02:21:18.404 --> 02:21:19.225]  Yeah, it's been a while.
[02:21:19.365 --> 02:21:23.468]  I've been trying to get through to your show, but I respect the first-time callers and let them get through.
[02:21:25.768 --> 02:21:30.312]  The Courier General had an article about putting bracelets on people that have the coronavirus.
[02:21:30.372 --> 02:21:32.734]  If they don't stay there, they have judge orders to be tracked.
[02:21:33.114 --> 02:21:36.637]  Oh, David Knight broke that a month ago, and next they're going to have microchips.
[02:21:36.677 --> 02:21:37.277]  It's all official.
[02:21:37.797 --> 02:21:38.298]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:21:38.418 --> 02:21:41.000]  And they're putting bracelets on them in New York, New Jersey.
[02:21:41.420 --> 02:21:42.601]  I've got the articles right here.
[02:21:43.522 --> 02:21:44.042]  Absolutely.
[02:21:44.062 --> 02:21:48.226]  And they go, oh, our imprisoned-at-home program works quite well.
[02:21:49.193 --> 02:21:54.137]  Oh yeah, this is such freedom, you know, with our Fuhrer, Bashir, our dictators.
[02:21:54.237 --> 02:21:55.898]  I'm in my concentration camp in Louisville.
[02:21:55.918 --> 02:21:56.939]  We're in a concentration camp.
[02:21:56.959 --> 02:21:57.920]  This is Warsaw Ghetto.
[02:21:58.080 --> 02:21:58.821]  That's what it is.
[02:21:59.081 --> 02:22:00.322]  We don't have leaders anymore.
[02:22:00.662 --> 02:22:01.483]  We have a dictator.
[02:22:01.783 --> 02:22:02.684]  Wake up, people!
[02:22:02.924 --> 02:22:04.225]  What's wrong with this country?
[02:22:05.366 --> 02:22:11.131]  Well, there's a virus, and as Fauci said, we cannot let one person die, so no one can leave their houses until no one ever dies again.
[02:22:11.151 --> 02:22:14.073]  And of course, the depression will cause mass death, as Trump said.
[02:22:14.513 --> 02:22:15.074]  God bless you.
[02:22:15.334 --> 02:22:16.475]  Chris, I'm moving quick to get to everybody.
[02:22:18.200 --> 02:22:20.082]  Let's go ahead and go to Ben in Texas.
[02:22:20.142 --> 02:22:20.882]  Ben, you're on the air.
[02:22:20.902 --> 02:22:21.282]  Go ahead.
[02:22:21.303 --> 02:22:24.025]  Hey, how's it going, Alex?
[02:22:24.805 --> 02:22:26.687]  Man, it's all unfolding right now.
[02:22:27.007 --> 02:22:28.588]  The absolute global meltdown.
[02:22:28.909 --> 02:22:32.411]  Kissinger licking his little demon lips, saying he'll never be free again.
[02:22:32.952 --> 02:22:34.333]  Depression for generations.
[02:22:34.353 --> 02:22:35.014]  Ha ha!
[02:22:35.154 --> 02:22:36.395]  We love it!
[02:22:36.415 --> 02:22:37.335]  It's liberal!
[02:22:38.677 --> 02:22:39.177]  Exactly.
[02:22:39.237 --> 02:22:45.162]  I mean, the scientific dictatorship, the technotronic elite, is here.
[02:22:45.342 --> 02:22:47.323]  Fauci, that's our dictator.
[02:22:49.618 --> 02:22:55.442]  And Bill Gates, he's all over the news saying, you don't leave your home till he has a special shot for you.
[02:22:56.926 --> 02:23:03.348]  Yeah, Bill Gates wants to get rid of all the old people and now his top concern is creating a vaccine.
[02:23:03.468 --> 02:23:09.030]  And so everybody better get really active and really loud and get the word out in legal and lawful ways.
[02:23:09.070 --> 02:23:13.551]  But the time for men and women just saying, oh, Alex, you're great or something.
[02:23:13.591 --> 02:23:16.912]  No, everybody better get aggressive in the info war now.
[02:23:17.173 --> 02:23:18.433]  That means at your keyboard.
[02:23:18.473 --> 02:23:19.453]  That's not a better place.
[02:23:20.053 --> 02:23:24.295]  Spreading articles and videos from this broadcast or others that tell the truth to everyone.
[02:23:24.935 --> 02:23:34.240]  With real info that this was a bio-attack, launched by the globalists, with the chi-coms, with all that proof, not, stay in your homes, it's magic, Q, it's so good.
[02:23:34.880 --> 02:23:35.420]  B.S.
[02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:38.082]  David Rockefeller's plan is being launched.
[02:23:38.442 --> 02:23:40.143]  Gates is up there saying, stay in your home.
[02:23:40.463 --> 02:23:42.184]  Q is run by the globalists.
[02:23:44.925 --> 02:23:45.705]  That's right, Alex.
[02:23:45.865 --> 02:23:48.487]  And, uh, I mean, we, the British are here.
[02:23:48.507 --> 02:23:50.868]  I mean, it's too late to, you know, send our homes.
[02:23:51.539 --> 02:23:55.501]  I'll tell you Alex, I feel closer to God right now than I ever have in my whole life.
[02:23:55.781 --> 02:23:56.001]  I know.
[02:23:56.021 --> 02:24:00.963]  Can you feel though that the enemy, when the enemy comes in like a flood, the spirit of the Lord lifts up a standard against it.
[02:24:02.004 --> 02:24:05.485]  Look, the archetype is like the sword sting in Lord of the Rings.
[02:24:05.745 --> 02:24:07.606]  When goblins are near, it starts going blue, man.
[02:24:08.026 --> 02:24:10.047]  It's flaming blue, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:24:11.028 --> 02:24:12.588]  I mean, you hear those drums?
[02:24:12.708 --> 02:24:13.109]  Drums.
[02:24:13.469 --> 02:24:14.269]  It's on, baby.
[02:24:15.049 --> 02:24:15.930]  The war ain't coming.
[02:24:15.990 --> 02:24:16.370]  It's here.
[02:24:16.390 --> 02:24:19.952]  All right.
[02:24:19.972 --> 02:24:20.932]  Well, God bless you, Alex.
[02:24:22.972 --> 02:24:24.653]  God bless you though, that's how I feel right now.
[02:24:24.713 --> 02:24:27.816]  I feel so close to God and my discernment is so incredible now.
[02:24:27.836 --> 02:24:34.681]  And we've just got to just trust in God, be calm, be focused, but get the word out and do what God tells us to do.
[02:24:37.944 --> 02:24:49.413]  Notice the illegal aliens, the pedophile marches, all that's going and they're allowed and the homeless, all the totally, you know, controlled is what the globalists, oh, do whatever you want.
[02:24:50.862 --> 02:24:53.783]  But the hard working, whether you're black, white, old, young, doesn't matter.
[02:24:54.103 --> 02:24:55.443]  You better sit there and do what we say.
[02:24:55.483 --> 02:24:57.044]  It's about you learning you're a criminal.
[02:24:57.344 --> 02:24:58.544]  You learning you don't have rights.
[02:24:58.584 --> 02:24:59.465]  You learning you're a slave.
[02:25:00.625 --> 02:25:02.746]  And getting all the tattletales in your face.
[02:25:04.166 --> 02:25:06.767]  And you see your neighbor call the police on somebody for going out?
[02:25:08.267 --> 02:25:08.887]  You go out.
[02:25:09.928 --> 02:25:11.268]  You see cops at a checkpoint?
[02:25:11.468 --> 02:25:12.288]  Everybody goes out.
[02:25:13.569 --> 02:25:15.129]  They're telling us our churches aren't essential.
[02:25:15.169 --> 02:25:16.390]  But oh, Walmart is.
[02:25:16.670 --> 02:25:17.410]  Target is.
[02:25:21.001 --> 02:25:26.446]  Like they've shut down art stores that are for schools and for people that do their art for a living.
[02:25:26.767 --> 02:25:28.168]  And they're like, oh, that's not essential.
[02:25:28.348 --> 02:25:29.890]  And now Walmart's saying, oh, you don't need seeds.
[02:25:29.930 --> 02:25:30.691]  That's not essential.
[02:25:31.311 --> 02:25:33.594]  That's what the Soviets did, wouldn't let people have seeds.
[02:25:33.814 --> 02:25:34.975]  I told you to get seeds, folks.
[02:25:35.475 --> 02:25:37.157]  And I'm telling you this, I appreciate your call.
[02:25:37.958 --> 02:25:41.682]  If you want stuff at Infowarshore.com, I told you this started two weeks ago, I said, listen,
[02:25:42.827 --> 02:25:43.787]  You better get your orders in.
[02:25:43.807 --> 02:25:45.328]  We're shipping stuff next day.
[02:25:45.688 --> 02:25:46.649]  And we've got food.
[02:25:47.029 --> 02:25:54.012]  We've got things like protein powder and protein bars and a lot of essential food we have that's separate from the storable food that ships within a day.
[02:25:54.392 --> 02:25:56.133]  And that's how we even stay open as a warehouse.
[02:25:56.153 --> 02:25:56.693]  We're essential.
[02:25:57.434 --> 02:26:01.916]  But yeah, they're moving towards only a select list of globalist companies are essential.
[02:26:02.856 --> 02:26:04.737]  And that's how the fascist system works.
[02:26:06.638 --> 02:26:10.143]  And you know they're already saying the media doesn't like the fact that the media is essential.
[02:26:10.183 --> 02:26:12.707]  First Amendment, you can't trump that unless you're, you know, North Korea.
[02:26:13.048 --> 02:26:14.329]  So the media is all staying home.
[02:26:14.370 --> 02:26:15.932]  But their crews are all there at their offices.
[02:26:15.952 --> 02:26:20.218]  The propagandists are all there at ABC, NBC, Fox, CNN, MSNBC.
[02:26:21.630 --> 02:26:23.191]  But they're already, everybody else is remote.
[02:26:23.532 --> 02:26:25.393]  It's that idea that, oh, the media can't be remote.
[02:26:25.574 --> 02:26:27.435]  We don't want reporters out asking questions.
[02:26:27.616 --> 02:26:29.717]  We don't want reporters out showing what the National Guard's doing.
[02:26:29.978 --> 02:26:35.943]  We don't want reporters out showing what the police are doing when they're giving evil, illegal orders coming that won't even be from Trump, but in the commands.
[02:26:36.564 --> 02:26:38.145]  The press is more important than ever.
[02:26:38.165 --> 02:26:42.850]  So I'm going to tell men this right now.
[02:26:42.870 --> 02:26:44.751]  If you
[02:26:48.049 --> 02:26:50.011]  Bow to this crap and bow to fear.
[02:26:50.051 --> 02:26:51.612]  You'll never get your freedom back.
[02:26:51.652 --> 02:26:54.475]  You better be afraid of the tyrants and the test.
[02:26:55.315 --> 02:26:59.239]  And it's all about compliance right now, and it's all about destroying confidence and having a depression.
[02:26:59.980 --> 02:27:03.463]  And they'll still have a lockdown during that, because there'll be all these new viruses and bugs.
[02:27:03.843 --> 02:27:08.207]  Anything killing 10, 20,000 people in your country, hadn't even done that yet, is the end of the world.
[02:27:09.088 --> 02:27:10.909]  Let's put up the map, guys, showing the numbers of deaths.
[02:27:10.929 --> 02:27:11.970]  You can believe the UN.
[02:27:12.250 --> 02:27:13.431]  Most of it dies of a heart attack.
[02:27:14.906 --> 02:27:15.947]  You're positive for COVID.
[02:27:16.407 --> 02:27:17.087]  Die of cancer.
[02:27:17.187 --> 02:27:18.308]  Now you're positive for COVID.
[02:27:18.528 --> 02:27:19.669]  The hospitals have the nurses.
[02:27:20.029 --> 02:27:20.509]  No mask.
[02:27:20.890 --> 02:27:22.050]  Spreading COVID everywhere.
[02:27:22.310 --> 02:27:28.134]  So when people die who are already sick, they can say it's COVID and create the biggest fear-mongering system they can.
[02:27:29.535 --> 02:27:30.855]  Yes, I think it's a serious virus.
[02:27:30.875 --> 02:27:32.837]  Yes, it's a bioweapon, but we're strong.
[02:27:33.937 --> 02:27:34.598]  So let's look at it.
[02:27:34.638 --> 02:27:36.459]  Let's bump the light level up on that for me.
[02:27:37.196 --> 02:27:38.517]  We've got Italy, 15,000 deaths.
[02:27:38.797 --> 02:27:39.317]  Spain, 11,000.
[02:27:39.737 --> 02:27:40.217]  France, 7,000.
[02:27:40.377 --> 02:27:41.078]  United Kingdom, 4,000.
[02:27:42.058 --> 02:27:42.438]  Iran, 3,000.
[02:27:43.158 --> 02:27:45.699]  Where's the United States?
[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:48.140]  Scroll guys for me, please.
[02:27:49.561 --> 02:27:50.101]  The U.S.
[02:27:50.661 --> 02:27:51.902]  That's not gonna happen in a minute.
[02:27:52.062 --> 02:27:52.742]  I'll just run over here.
[02:27:52.762 --> 02:27:52.742]  8,175.
[02:27:52.782 --> 02:27:56.884]  Blue killed 80,000.
[02:28:02.560 --> 02:28:09.929]  And if you've seen hysteria over 8,000, when it hits 80,000 like the flu in 2018, it will be sacrifice your babies into fire pits!
[02:28:10.469 --> 02:28:11.170]  And people will be like, ah!
[02:28:11.190 --> 02:28:14.654]  You know, because Harvard says breathing spreads it well.
[02:28:14.894 --> 02:28:15.755]  Kill yourselves!
[02:28:17.798 --> 02:28:20.000]  The answer to not having death is no life.
[02:28:20.401 --> 02:28:21.342]  I'm not saying do that, folks.
[02:28:21.382 --> 02:28:22.123]  I'm being sarcastic.
[02:28:23.868 --> 02:28:25.970]  Tim at one of the major epicenters.
[02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:29.594]  Now Biden says close the flights to China is the right thing to do.
[02:28:29.974 --> 02:28:32.597]  Tim in Seattle, because now they've gotten here and done their job.
[02:28:32.837 --> 02:28:33.898]  Tim, give us your view, sir.
[02:28:35.059 --> 02:28:36.180]  Hey Alex, how's it going?
[02:28:36.220 --> 02:28:37.582]  Thanks for the broadcast on Saturday.
[02:28:37.602 --> 02:28:39.604]  I appreciate your effort and diligence today.
[02:28:39.624 --> 02:28:41.646]  Well, who knows how long we'll be able to do this, brother.
[02:28:42.682 --> 02:28:43.122]  Exactly.
[02:28:43.843 --> 02:28:47.866]  In the meantime, how come America is allowing the Georgia Guidestones to stand?
[02:28:47.926 --> 02:28:49.227]  This is a message to us.
[02:28:49.287 --> 02:28:51.768]  We've been marked for death by the global fighting world.
[02:28:51.788 --> 02:28:53.209]  You know, that's a good point you just made.
[02:28:53.329 --> 02:28:54.390]  I'm not saying something.
[02:28:54.410 --> 02:28:56.692]  In fact, do not take a tractor at 3 a.m.
[02:28:56.752 --> 02:28:57.733]  and run those suckers down.
[02:28:58.513 --> 02:29:02.495]  Do not do stunts to stand up to them and let them know we know what they're doing.
[02:29:02.776 --> 02:29:10.860]  Let Ted Turner mark us like in that movie, Chronicles of Riddick, where the evil death cult comes and plants their stone when they kill your planet.
[02:29:11.401 --> 02:29:12.801]  We should worship the stones.
[02:29:13.182 --> 02:29:13.502]  No!
[02:29:13.682 --> 02:29:14.502]  Protect them!
[02:29:14.943 --> 02:29:16.704]  Sacrifice your children on them!
[02:29:17.064 --> 02:29:18.505]  How dare you, Tim!
[02:29:19.909 --> 02:29:20.329]  Exactly.
[02:29:20.910 --> 02:29:29.454]  Also, Alex, I want to mention that I think what's going on is that the virus is, it's basically a binary weapon for the radiation from Fukushima.
[02:29:29.494 --> 02:29:34.997]  I think what we're doing is we're seeing a lot of people succumbing to... You're really, I meant to say that today because it's in the ether.
[02:29:35.217 --> 02:29:36.818]  Radiation lowers immunity.
[02:29:37.158 --> 02:29:41.000]  Every time there's a Chernobyl or you name it, then they have a bunch of people die from the common cold.
[02:29:41.581 --> 02:29:42.061]  Keep talking.
[02:29:43.106 --> 02:29:48.908]  Yes, well, see, the low-dose ionizing radiation has been coming down on America for, like, the last nine years.
[02:29:49.688 --> 02:29:50.448]  We've been charting it.
[02:29:51.469 --> 02:29:56.810]  We've also done a lot of research as far as that the radiation does increase schizophrenic episodes in people.
[02:29:56.870 --> 02:30:05.533]  So, I mean, they've really... This is a mad science playground, and we're all cowards, and we're all full of apathy, and I'm sick to death of it.
[02:30:05.933 --> 02:30:07.434]  I'm absolutely sick to death of it.
[02:30:07.454 --> 02:30:08.114]  No, I hear you.
[02:30:08.134 --> 02:30:09.775]  The apathy of the... Sorry, go ahead.
[02:30:11.977 --> 02:30:19.163]  Well, I just, I mean, I want action and I want to stand against the globalists, but still at the same time, I'm tinned in, I don't want my kids taken from me.
[02:30:19.503 --> 02:30:20.945]  There's so many ways that they've got us.
[02:30:20.965 --> 02:30:22.226]  I hope America realizes that.
[02:30:22.246 --> 02:30:29.111]  But if we don't start taking action on civil disobedience and getting hardcore, they're already taking their lives from them with the invisible weapons like 5G.
[02:30:31.164 --> 02:30:31.985]  Yep, absolutely.
[02:30:32.225 --> 02:30:35.367]  It's immense, but it's not impossible.
[02:30:35.587 --> 02:30:36.688]  It just takes a little bit of effort.
[02:30:36.708 --> 02:30:42.352]  Imagine what it's like being a BuzzFeed or a Media Matters person who knows you're not part of the establishment, who knows you're being killed by this.
[02:30:42.372 --> 02:30:44.514]  Because I've talked to a lot of people off-record.
[02:30:44.554 --> 02:30:47.296]  They actually know the truth, but still stay at their job out of fear.
[02:30:47.676 --> 02:30:48.937]  Killing yourself to live.
[02:30:50.478 --> 02:30:51.939]  Just imagine being those people.
[02:30:53.157 --> 02:31:02.293]  Yeah, it's pretty dark and bleak when you start to look at... When you try to be an empath to our opposition, it's very abysmal.
[02:31:02.794 --> 02:31:05.659]  Also, I got one last final message, and that's to Zach Voorhees.
[02:31:06.292 --> 02:31:20.581]  Alex Jones at Infowars has saved millions upon millions of lives from the eugenics industrial complex by warning us, by keeping us informed and alert to what's going on, and Q has done nothing but just lead us in the dark.
[02:31:20.921 --> 02:31:22.121]  So, Q's garbage.
[02:31:22.982 --> 02:31:24.023]  I hope Zach comes around.
[02:31:24.043 --> 02:31:26.564]  I don't even know what's going on with Zach Voorhees.
[02:31:26.604 --> 02:31:27.965]  We could have a Q discussion.
[02:31:27.985 --> 02:31:32.868]  I mean, look, the Q thing, if you talk about Q, YouTube and Google pushes it.
[02:31:33.308 --> 02:31:34.269]  Now, what does that tell you?
[02:31:35.069 --> 02:31:36.491]  I mean, they are pushing it.
[02:31:36.611 --> 02:31:45.181]  It is, oh, we lied to you for your own good, and we have the secret intel, and then real people jacked into everything that brought the whole movement forward, this audience.
[02:31:45.562 --> 02:31:46.864]  Oh, we're the bad guys, Q says.
[02:31:48.072 --> 02:31:48.292]  Mm-hmm.
[02:31:48.652 --> 02:31:49.293]  Yeah.
[02:31:49.373 --> 02:31:50.054]  It's pretty insane.
[02:31:50.074 --> 02:31:51.655]  But Q never says anything about fluoride.
[02:31:51.675 --> 02:31:52.916]  Q never says anything about GMO.
[02:31:53.376 --> 02:31:55.278]  Q doesn't say, go protest your grocery stores.
[02:31:55.318 --> 02:31:56.759]  Go get the refined sugar off the shelves.
[02:31:57.099 --> 02:32:00.402]  Go make your immune system better.
[02:32:00.482 --> 02:32:01.562]  Q says nothing like that.
[02:32:01.763 --> 02:32:03.644]  Q says, trust the plan and stay in your house.
[02:32:03.724 --> 02:32:04.585]  You'll protect America.
[02:32:05.185 --> 02:32:06.626]  Infowars protects America.
[02:32:07.027 --> 02:32:07.647]  Just flat out.
[02:32:07.947 --> 02:32:10.669]  You know, and I really, really, really appreciate your guys' effort.
[02:32:11.130 --> 02:32:11.950]  It's amazing.
[02:32:12.231 --> 02:32:13.372]  You guys should pat yourselves on the back.
[02:32:13.392 --> 02:32:14.292]  Brother, I'm not... What?
[02:32:14.332 --> 02:32:15.573]  We're all in this vote together.
[02:32:15.593 --> 02:32:16.814]  Hell, I'm just bailing water here.
[02:32:16.854 --> 02:32:17.355]  God bless you.
[02:32:18.533 --> 02:32:20.074]  See, I'm not mad at Collar's thanking us.
[02:32:20.354 --> 02:32:24.195]  Just buy the products, spread the word, and just, that keeps us in the fight.
[02:32:24.215 --> 02:32:25.456]  Because I knew we had to stay on air.
[02:32:25.496 --> 02:32:26.556]  They really wanted us off air.
[02:32:26.876 --> 02:32:28.357]  Man, they tried to plant child porn on us.
[02:32:28.377 --> 02:32:29.357]  They tried to pay people off.
[02:32:29.377 --> 02:32:31.318]  They tried to put me in jail.
[02:32:31.618 --> 02:32:33.179]  They sued us 40-something times.
[02:32:33.219 --> 02:32:34.439]  They just went crazy.
[02:32:35.220 --> 02:32:36.800]  Just did stuff never before seen.
[02:32:37.200 --> 02:32:38.341]  But God kept us on air.
[02:32:38.401 --> 02:32:40.221]  You kept us on air for this time now.
[02:32:41.362 --> 02:32:43.323]  For the time when everyone will be taken off the air.
[02:32:44.683 --> 02:32:46.164]  And then Q will still be left, though.
[02:32:47.179 --> 02:32:50.081]  Probably even after Trump's been assassinated, it'll go, I am Q!
[02:32:50.341 --> 02:32:51.482]  Communism is good!
[02:32:51.762 --> 02:32:52.863]  Give your children to me!
[02:32:53.964 --> 02:32:54.905]  Q, stab your baby!
[02:32:55.926 --> 02:33:01.770]  You know, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's just so, and people are like, oh, you're jealous of Q, the one that started it all.
[02:33:01.830 --> 02:33:08.035]  It's just like, Q's breaking news this week, that it may be a bioweapon from Wuhan!
[02:33:08.695 --> 02:33:10.997]  Alex, you're not covering it's a bioweapon from Wuhan!
[02:33:11.437 --> 02:33:12.138]  It's a joke!
[02:33:14.369 --> 02:33:17.330]  And so many people want to believe it's okay, especially women.
[02:33:17.790 --> 02:33:22.430]  I'm not putting women down, but a lot of women are like, no, it's Trump, he's doing it all.
[02:33:22.690 --> 02:33:25.611]  It's Q, we're winning, and the hospital ships are taking him away.
[02:33:27.391 --> 02:33:28.752]  No, folks, we're in a fight for our lives.
[02:33:29.572 --> 02:33:32.012]  And admitting we're in deep trouble can get us out of it.
[02:33:32.392 --> 02:33:34.212]  Lying to ourselves will get our gooses cooked.
[02:33:41.714 --> 02:33:42.854]  Shane Stoner gave me a call.
[02:33:44.153 --> 02:33:47.676]  This morning, he was talking to a famous musician who called him last night.
[02:33:49.478 --> 02:33:52.020]  And I got to give him a call, and they were asking, am I Bill Hicks?
[02:33:52.080 --> 02:33:53.481]  Because Shane went to high school with me.
[02:33:54.261 --> 02:34:01.487]  And Shane said, no, when Bill Hicks was on Letterman, like in 1992 and stuff, Alex Jones was in high school with me at Anderson High.
[02:34:02.401 --> 02:34:05.083]  And they go, oh, it's a fake yearbook and all this crap.
[02:34:05.123 --> 02:34:06.124]  I mean, it's insane.
[02:34:06.524 --> 02:34:07.886]  But see, I'm not real.
[02:34:08.486 --> 02:34:09.147]  Q is.
[02:34:09.847 --> 02:34:11.949]  And people go, oh, newspapers don't push that.
[02:34:12.429 --> 02:34:12.689]  Really?
[02:34:12.850 --> 02:34:15.792]  National News, Texas Monthly has pushed that I am Bill Hicks.
[02:34:16.553 --> 02:34:17.313]  As a sick joke.
[02:34:19.195 --> 02:34:22.677]  I'm giving you real documents, real information, proof here.
[02:34:24.439 --> 02:34:28.002]  But the Cuban was like, oh, we don't care about a Rockefeller plan to launch this and admitting it.
[02:34:28.783 --> 02:34:29.343]  Lockstep.
[02:34:29.684 --> 02:34:31.865]  We don't care about Event 201 or Memorandum 200.
[02:34:31.905 --> 02:34:33.747]  This is, you know, 201 now.
[02:34:34.487 --> 02:34:34.828]  No, no.
[02:34:34.888 --> 02:34:38.911]  We just care that everything's alright and Trump's going to arrest the pedophiles.
[02:34:38.971 --> 02:34:39.711]  We told you that.
[02:34:39.951 --> 02:34:41.012]  We exposed the WikiLeaks.
[02:34:41.352 --> 02:34:42.333]  I got attacked for that.
[02:34:42.613 --> 02:34:44.475]  We did that before the cute thing existed.
[02:34:46.260 --> 02:34:47.220]  It's ridiculous!
[02:34:47.260 --> 02:34:52.923]  It's like saying you don't trust your father, but you trust a snakehole with a rattlesnake.
[02:34:52.943 --> 02:34:53.603]  He's like, let me see!
[02:34:53.823 --> 02:34:55.244]  My ruler is in a black hole!
[02:34:55.264 --> 02:34:57.185]  And he's like, bites your hand, you go, oh!
[02:34:57.225 --> 02:34:59.206]  And the snake goes, I have to bite you to protect you!
[02:34:59.666 --> 02:35:01.027]  I have to lie to you to protect you!
[02:35:01.307 --> 02:35:01.947]  I'm Q!
[02:35:02.507 --> 02:35:04.468]  I don't want to end this talking about Q, it doesn't even matter.
[02:35:04.969 --> 02:35:06.649]  I just get these calls, it's Q real.
[02:35:06.669 --> 02:35:10.131]  I have like family call me and go, we never used to think you were right, you're right about it all.
[02:35:10.611 --> 02:35:14.093]  And because I heard you talk about all this years ago, you know, do you know who Q is?
[02:35:15.899 --> 02:35:18.941]  I'm like, yeah, I know who started it and got taken away from him in three days.
[02:35:23.245 --> 02:35:26.808]  And I guess I'll cover it Wednesday.
[02:35:26.828 --> 02:35:27.869]  Oh, God.
[02:35:28.589 --> 02:35:31.412]  It won't even matter because it's a cult.
[02:35:32.452 --> 02:35:36.075]  People can be shown like a blank piece of paper and go, this has the secrets of the universe.
[02:35:36.376 --> 02:35:39.598]  But unless you're part of the secret group and get our initiations, you can't see it.
[02:35:40.439 --> 02:35:41.460]  It's the Emperor's New Clothes.
[02:35:42.688 --> 02:35:45.090]  You've got to go read the parable of the Emperor's New Clothes if you're a Q follower.
[02:35:45.970 --> 02:35:53.336]  And if something's real bonafide, like men and women, they go, no, the two sexes don't exist.
[02:35:53.396 --> 02:35:57.479]  And then everybody fights over, yeah, they don't exist, even though it's like prima facie, that's what exists.
[02:35:59.100 --> 02:36:04.604]  But if it's blank, you can project onto it like a Rorschach blot whatever you want.
[02:36:07.119 --> 02:36:09.300]  Instead of the facts that are right there.
[02:36:09.961 --> 02:36:11.101]  And that's why it's so dangerous.
[02:36:11.701 --> 02:36:14.223]  That's what satanism and the occult and all of this is.
[02:36:14.303 --> 02:36:15.443]  It's gnostic crap.
[02:36:17.104 --> 02:36:19.966]  Instead of just the proof of all the things are there.
[02:36:20.686 --> 02:36:21.366]  Nothing's hidden.
[02:36:23.507 --> 02:36:24.288]  Except scams.
[02:36:29.161 --> 02:36:33.526]  People that have been programmed by the world, once the awakening happens, they can't allow an awakening.
[02:36:33.546 --> 02:36:38.471]  They've got to have a false awakening, so that you're told, sit there and don't do anything, trust the plan.
[02:36:38.491 --> 02:36:43.897]  I mean, and it's meant to be outrageous, as we one go, we all go.
[02:36:43.917 --> 02:36:45.558]  What is this, a Jim Jones cult?
[02:36:46.319 --> 02:36:47.100]  Trust the plan?
[02:36:47.160 --> 02:36:48.121]  What the hell?
[02:36:48.381 --> 02:36:50.724]  Don't trust me, check what I say!
[02:36:57.765 --> 02:37:16.335]  I thought about, just because the reality TV nature of it would be solid awakening gold, actually contact some of the crazies on YouTube that literally think I'm Bill Hicks, and then take them to my house and open up pictures and 8mm videos of me fishing when I'm 5 years old.
[02:37:17.336 --> 02:37:21.858]  And they'll just go, it was so elaborate that he was Bill Hicks.
[02:37:22.058 --> 02:37:23.659]  You can't, they're deceived.
[02:37:24.079 --> 02:37:24.900]  You either have
[02:37:25.905 --> 02:37:29.271]  Discernment, or you are one given over to delusion.
[02:37:31.943 --> 02:37:33.964]  They don't want the proof it's a bio-web.
[02:37:34.024 --> 02:37:37.046]  They don't want us, they want to believe everything's okay.
[02:37:38.607 --> 02:37:40.788]  Everybody said there wasn't a world government, a new world order.
[02:37:41.008 --> 02:37:41.748]  They were delusional.
[02:37:41.788 --> 02:37:48.932]  Now that it's all admitted and they're on the news announcing world government, don't worry, there's a secret good group in the world government that's stopping it all.
[02:37:49.733 --> 02:37:51.714]  It's just the next level of the delusion.
[02:37:52.034 --> 02:37:56.516]  And the very people that exposed it all on target, that is the bad person.
[02:37:57.297 --> 02:37:59.498]  That tells you that, again, that thing is the bad thing.
[02:38:00.660 --> 02:38:04.402]  But you can't ever attack it or face it because you can't face your accuser.
[02:38:04.662 --> 02:38:06.243]  Because that's how the good people are.
[02:38:06.283 --> 02:38:07.923]  They're secret and you can't face them.
[02:38:09.544 --> 02:38:11.345]  And they lie to you because they're the good guys.
[02:38:11.425 --> 02:38:12.285]  This is what Q says.
[02:38:13.026 --> 02:38:17.828]  It's just a bunch of global... Now it's just con artists and scammers and crazy people.
[02:38:18.783 --> 02:38:26.426]  But some really manipulative folks got scared of it because it was going to be a vehicle to expose the pedophile rings and the things that they'd shut me down on.
[02:38:26.666 --> 02:38:29.327]  Some other folks said, well, we can't get targeted like Jones.
[02:38:29.748 --> 02:38:33.729]  We'll just say we're Intel because they were, and we'll start releasing some stuff.
[02:38:34.089 --> 02:38:35.690]  And folks are like, we're not going to allow that.
[02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:38.151]  They take over that with a disinformation operation.
[02:38:38.311 --> 02:38:39.972]  That's standard spy stuff!
[02:38:41.015 --> 02:38:46.598]  But people that want to believe all this Q stuff don't want to go read real spy manuals or psych warfare stuff and know how it works.
[02:38:46.839 --> 02:38:50.661]  They just want to sit there and get conned because it feels good!
[02:38:54.963 --> 02:38:55.684]  Okay then!
[02:38:55.704 --> 02:38:57.885]  I don't want to talk about it anymore.
[02:38:58.806 --> 02:39:00.287]  Dan in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:39:03.028 --> 02:39:07.931]  Hey Alex, I understand your frustration, but let's change the subject.
[02:39:09.795 --> 02:39:12.597]  I actually wanted to point out something my wife noticed.
[02:39:13.277 --> 02:39:24.485]  The murals at the Denver airport depicting, you know, the soldier in the gas mask with all the children seem to be, you know, the only ones in color.
[02:39:24.505 --> 02:39:27.807]  And later, murals, they're mourning.
[02:39:27.847 --> 02:39:31.830]  Yeah, it's like a Nazi soldier herding men, women, and children into a death camp.
[02:39:32.990 --> 02:39:40.497]  Right, he's got a gas mask on, and they've got gargoyles, and they've got Egyptian pyramids on top of it, Egyptian gods on top of it.
[02:39:40.757 --> 02:39:43.280]  It's what's out on the tarmac there that's evil.
[02:39:45.202 --> 02:39:49.806]  Right, well, you know, they noticed that they have in the murals, the children are all mourning over the adults.
[02:39:50.711 --> 02:39:58.135]  And at the end, they're the only ones left, and the children are happy, and they have a kind of a depiction of a one-world, you know, order.
[02:39:58.175 --> 02:40:02.637]  They've got all the flags all intertwined together, and the children are celebrating.
[02:40:02.717 --> 02:40:05.398]  It's very strange, cryptic.
[02:40:05.558 --> 02:40:07.059]  I mean, it's not anything new.
[02:40:07.079 --> 02:40:11.281]  Well, that's how they sold everyone in world government in the last hundred years, was they're gonna end war.
[02:40:11.541 --> 02:40:13.181]  But really, it's in humans now, we learn.
[02:40:15.062 --> 02:40:15.963]  Right, right.
[02:40:17.267 --> 02:40:23.292]  You know, the 5G thing is really aggravating to me.
[02:40:23.452 --> 02:40:29.356]  What I find interesting is that friends of mine that don't really pay any attention to any kind of, you know,
[02:40:31.078 --> 02:40:32.219]  Conspiracy type things.
[02:40:32.319 --> 02:40:33.480]  Everybody's onto it now.
[02:40:33.580 --> 02:40:35.182]  It's spreading like crazy.
[02:40:35.302 --> 02:40:40.367]  And this idea that the 5G is kind of suspicious and this whole thing.
[02:40:40.847 --> 02:40:42.709]  And I don't know anybody that actually wants it.
[02:40:43.169 --> 02:40:44.330]  You know, they didn't ask us.
[02:40:44.550 --> 02:40:45.571]  Nobody said, hey, we just want it.
[02:40:45.611 --> 02:40:47.053]  Oh, it's being banned in Switzerland.
[02:40:47.213 --> 02:40:49.495]  Statistics like 89% of people want it banned.
[02:40:49.775 --> 02:40:50.976]  All these cities are trying to block it.
[02:40:51.177 --> 02:40:56.882]  But they're just rolling it out and putting it in disguised lampposts all over the country, whether you like it or not.
[02:40:58.567 --> 02:41:01.989]  Yeah, I mean, I'm not saying people should destroy them, but I'm not going to try it.
[02:41:02.009 --> 02:41:06.231]  But it's like Q though, it needs to be secret, it needs to hurt you and lie to you for your own good.
[02:41:07.311 --> 02:41:14.435]  You don't need to have it out in the open and say 5G, it needs to be hidden as a fake tree or as a fake lamppost or in a power pole.
[02:41:14.815 --> 02:41:24.760]  Are you saying, like Q, the radiation is invisible, it's good, it's liberal, like the big mombiot who now says he believes in radiation because it'll get rid of the humans.
[02:41:25.681 --> 02:41:27.582]  Why don't you love the invisible radiation, son?
[02:41:30.083 --> 02:41:38.085]  Well, you know, there's a good quote from former Pentagon Joint Chief of Staff Lieutenant Colonel Jack Kingston.
[02:41:38.105 --> 02:41:45.227]  It says, the best covert operation is one that's done in broad daylight in front of everyone's eyes, yet no one sees a thing.
[02:41:46.588 --> 02:41:46.988]  Exactly.
[02:41:47.088 --> 02:41:47.968]  Hiding in plain view.
[02:41:48.528 --> 02:41:58.191]  5G, Q, I mean, you know, it very much points at Q, I think, you know, in front of everyone's eyes and no one seems to know that it's
[02:41:59.073 --> 02:42:01.734]  It's not what it seems to be or what it pretends to be.
[02:42:02.774 --> 02:42:03.535]  It's unbelievable.
[02:42:03.595 --> 02:42:06.356]  Well, the big tell on anything like that is it's boosted.
[02:42:07.376 --> 02:42:09.857]  And artificially boosted and allowed to run rampant.
[02:42:10.557 --> 02:42:20.181]  And again, I say free speech to it all, but it just takes delusionals and it makes them feel like they're part of something because it's esoteric and weird and magic and they just do one thing.
[02:42:20.421 --> 02:42:22.601]  You just stay in your house and we defeat the evil people.
[02:42:22.862 --> 02:42:26.503]  And it's the whole UN and the world government and Bill Gates saying, don't you leave your damn house.
[02:42:28.896 --> 02:42:35.541]  The vaccine, Q says, has a cure in it, because they're going to release a weapon on the bad globalists, but you've got to have the vaccine.
[02:42:35.581 --> 02:42:36.721]  Guaranteed that Q will say that.
[02:42:36.962 --> 02:42:38.943]  You've got to have the vaccine to stop it!
[02:42:40.744 --> 02:42:42.025]  Yeah, you know, trust the plan, right?
[02:42:42.185 --> 02:42:44.246]  Oh, the kid's died, but it's a magic.
[02:42:44.326 --> 02:42:49.850]  You take the shot and the kid dies, but their spirit goes to heaven, and God needs you to be injected with that to know you're good.
[02:42:49.870 --> 02:42:51.391]  I mean, you know, oh good!
[02:42:51.691 --> 02:42:54.533]  And Q needs you to feed your kid to a blender.
[02:42:56.516 --> 02:42:58.918]  Well, you know, they would just tell you to trust the plan.
[02:42:58.938 --> 02:43:00.199]  That's all they ever say.
[02:43:00.339 --> 02:43:01.219]  God bless you, Dan.
[02:43:01.239 --> 02:43:01.740]  I love you.
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:02.720]  Oh, my God.
[02:43:03.541 --> 02:43:04.902]  Patrick in Texas, you're on the air.
[02:43:06.683 --> 02:43:07.063]  Hey, Alex.
[02:43:07.083 --> 02:43:08.705]  Just wanted to touch base real quick with you.
[02:43:08.745 --> 02:43:15.189]  I mean, you do these immunizations and you think about our vaccinations, you think about just a very basic level.
[02:43:15.750 --> 02:43:23.435]  Do you think that it's normal by any standard or any possible way that you should have something introduced into your body
[02:43:24.045 --> 02:43:26.394]  Being jabbed through your skin and into your muscle.
[02:43:26.946 --> 02:43:37.610]  No, I think even if they're good, clean vaccines that are doing what they say they do and not piggyback with a bunch of Trojan horses, then in almost every case they're bad.
[02:43:37.650 --> 02:43:45.832]  Unless there was some real super pathogen and it was proven to work and then they told you the risk, but they lie to you about the risk and they do it all and it's bad news.
[02:43:46.213 --> 02:43:52.935]  But a form of immunization is when your kids are healthy, you know the neighbor kid has measles or mumps.
[02:43:52.995 --> 02:43:56.176]  A lot of folks, people that are mainly medical doctors, they don't talk about it.
[02:43:56.676 --> 02:43:57.597]  Exactly, that's the way it should be.
[02:43:57.617 --> 02:43:59.439]  You should properly, you should show them properly nutrient.
[02:44:15.251 --> 02:44:16.891]  Nutrient-based and that's a problem.
[02:44:16.912 --> 02:44:19.332]  I think we have a majority for the lower GI system.
[02:44:19.372 --> 02:44:20.432]  It's totally annihilated.
[02:44:21.213 --> 02:44:25.454]  The immune system is just totally... Oh yeah, one thing I haven't plugged enough.
[02:44:25.494 --> 02:44:27.554]  Probiotics, probiotics, gut health.
[02:44:27.574 --> 02:44:28.254]  You're absolutely right.
[02:44:29.135 --> 02:44:31.235]  Yeah, I mean the products that you sell are dead on.
[02:44:31.595 --> 02:44:36.977]  I mean from different spectrums, different levels of iodine, all the different elements that you need to keep your body healthy.
[02:44:36.997 --> 02:44:41.498]  And I've spent thousands of dollars on your products and I've taken them and I take other products as well.
[02:44:42.174 --> 02:44:43.635]  I'll tell you, it's dead on.
[02:44:43.695 --> 02:44:58.947]  It's high quality, and if people question, you know, what's in it and what the cost is on it, it's absolutely insane to do that because it is very, very well manufactured with high quality content, and the price point on it's phenomenal compared to the rest of the trash that's on the market.
[02:44:59.480 --> 02:45:04.041]  And so I do appreciate that aspect of what you bring to the table as well, not only from the information standpoint.
[02:45:04.421 --> 02:45:10.803]  Well, thanks for putting up with me, because, you know, we're covering a lot of hardcore info here, and I get a little wacky, but, I mean, this is a crazy time.
[02:45:10.843 --> 02:45:11.543]  God bless you, Patrick.
[02:45:11.583 --> 02:45:20.025]  I gotta move quick, because the babysitter and wife and stuff, I gotta, I'm glad I could be here ten hours, but, you know, it is Saturday, so I've got limited help right now.
[02:45:20.745 --> 02:45:22.726]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[02:45:22.766 --> 02:45:24.046]  John in California, you're on the air.
[02:45:25.029 --> 02:45:29.851]  Hi Alex, I really appreciate this time and I really appreciate you taking my call.
[02:45:29.871 --> 02:45:30.731]  Appreciate you.
[02:45:30.791 --> 02:45:34.453]  So, I'm asking some clear cut questions.
[02:45:34.993 --> 02:45:38.515]  Let's just say this is 100% intentional.
[02:45:38.895 --> 02:45:41.916]  This is 100% a biological weapon.
[02:45:42.256 --> 02:45:47.178]  OK, we know from Pearl Harbor, you basically saw the plane flying over.
[02:45:47.258 --> 02:45:53.881]  People that were living in Hawaii said, yeah, when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, you could see the plane flying over.
[02:45:54.281 --> 02:45:56.143]  The same was true with Great Britain.
[02:45:56.403 --> 02:45:58.124]  They saw the planes flying over.
[02:45:58.464 --> 02:46:09.533]  How do we know that somebody's not getting on a plane right now and launching more of this biological weapon in, let's say, the UK or in South Africa?
[02:46:09.873 --> 02:46:19.360]  Because if you look at a map, it seems extremely suspicious that there's some places that are really saturated and other places that don't seem like they're affected at all.
[02:46:21.391 --> 02:46:22.612]  No, I totally agree with you.
[02:46:22.672 --> 02:46:26.594]  And they've got bioweapons now where it mutates only once or twice and then becomes harmless.
[02:46:26.634 --> 02:46:28.235]  That's the type you want to release so you can control it.
[02:46:28.275 --> 02:46:30.256]  It does look very, very suspicious.
[02:46:30.276 --> 02:46:40.982]  There are also controlled jurisdictions that are corrupt, show that nurses and the medical examiners in leftist areas will then call a heart attack or cancer, COVID-19, and then they just assess those deaths.
[02:46:41.002 --> 02:46:42.003]  That could be going on as well.
[02:46:42.563 --> 02:46:43.383]  I don't think we know yet.
[02:46:43.743 --> 02:46:44.204]  Go ahead, John.
[02:46:45.031 --> 02:46:51.315]  So it's very possible that this could be launched today because Mike Adams is saying, oh, the numbers are low.
[02:46:51.675 --> 02:46:58.719]  Well, if you look at Japan or you look at what the Nazis did, they reloaded their planes and they went out again.
[02:46:58.739 --> 02:47:07.224]  So technically speaking, there could be people going into designated areas right now to launch more of this and just say, oh, it's all the same thing.
[02:47:07.544 --> 02:47:08.124]  I hear you, John.
[02:47:08.144 --> 02:47:08.665]  Great points.
[02:47:09.105 --> 02:47:12.647]  All right, Dawson and then Patrick, we're going to go to a special report and live transmission.
[02:47:12.967 --> 02:47:14.048]  Dawson in California, go ahead.
[02:47:15.182 --> 02:47:15.822]  Hey, how are you doing?
[02:47:16.142 --> 02:47:16.722]  I'm alright, brother.
[02:47:16.742 --> 02:47:18.363]  Well, humanity's in trouble.
[02:47:18.383 --> 02:47:19.363]  This is the Globalist plan.
[02:47:19.383 --> 02:47:22.063]  They're closing the trap on us right now.
[02:47:22.963 --> 02:47:23.323]  Oh, yeah, man.
[02:47:23.343 --> 02:47:24.084]  It's really sad.
[02:47:24.224 --> 02:47:33.385]  So, I actually had something to say, and I think there's another disease going around besides the coronavirus, and I think that's the illusion.
[02:47:33.865 --> 02:47:43.367]  I know so many of our Republican friends who we always agree with each other, and I'm just bringing up some of the points that you had mentioned, how, you know, the coronavirus deaths
[02:47:44.051 --> 02:47:49.802]  Might be over reported just because of the other underlying health conditions.
[02:47:51.269 --> 02:47:54.091]  And they get so angry whenever I bring those points up.
[02:47:54.391 --> 02:47:54.972]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:47:55.112 --> 02:47:57.294]  I don't think we know the truth because the Chai comms lied.
[02:47:57.594 --> 02:47:59.736]  I don't think the Italians are, and it looks pretty bad.
[02:47:59.816 --> 02:48:01.837]  So that's why I think the jury's out right now.
[02:48:01.877 --> 02:48:04.980]  But we know the power grab from the globalists is real.
[02:48:05.000 --> 02:48:07.522]  And we know the Level 4 labs are where this came from.
[02:48:07.542 --> 02:48:14.607]  So the very institutions saying they're protecting us, Fauci, you're literally looking at an officer of the Sikh priesthood that is behind this.
[02:48:16.088 --> 02:48:16.328]  Right.
[02:48:16.368 --> 02:48:16.568]  Yeah.
[02:48:16.588 --> 02:48:21.052]  And on top of that, though, they, um, you know, they're starting to say, you know, churches should be forced closed.
[02:48:21.587 --> 02:48:25.674]  You know, if you're the type of person that believes in... Yeah, no, only Walmart's allowed to stay open.
[02:48:25.714 --> 02:48:26.234]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:48:26.775 --> 02:48:30.181]  We always knew during the emergency, during martial law, that only Walmart would be allowed to stay open.
[02:48:31.198 --> 02:48:31.779]  Oh yeah, I know.
[02:48:31.859 --> 02:48:37.243]  You guys pretty much already covered this, but you know, just this morning I woke up and in Sanford, they started writing citations.
[02:48:37.743 --> 02:48:43.368]  They did five arrests and 40 citations here in Capitola, just for people walking on the beach.
[02:48:43.408 --> 02:48:45.470]  Just, you know, a couple groups of families.
[02:48:45.770 --> 02:48:50.254]  Because the families weren't distancing six feet away from each other, they're handing out... Sure, look at this.
[02:48:50.374 --> 02:48:55.138]  Ankle monitors ordered for Louisville, Kentucky residents exposed to COVID-19 who refuse to stay at home.
[02:48:55.478 --> 02:48:56.779]  And again, you'll get your app, all of it.
[02:48:56.819 --> 02:48:57.540]  Gotta move, Dawson.
[02:48:57.560 --> 02:48:57.980]  Great points.
[02:48:58.240 --> 02:49:00.042]  Patrick, in Ohio, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:49:02.432 --> 02:49:03.232]  Alex, I'm angry.
[02:49:03.893 --> 02:49:09.634]  I'm going to try to keep my composure throughout this call with you, but I'm frustrated.
[02:49:09.654 --> 02:49:12.255]  I want to talk about a subject that's largely ignored.
[02:49:13.436 --> 02:49:19.877]  In the year 1900, whites, those of European stock, made up 30% of the world population.
[02:49:19.998 --> 02:49:25.479]  Today, in the year 2020, whites now only make up 8% of the world population.
[02:49:25.579 --> 02:49:31.481]  In a matter of 100 years, we as a people went from being one-third of the world population to being one-tenth.
[02:49:32.253 --> 02:49:35.615]  Those with blue eyes constitute only 6% of the world population.
[02:49:35.975 --> 02:49:37.116]  Those with green eyes, only 2%.
[02:49:37.216 --> 02:49:43.899]  Whites are the world's global minority, yet we are referred to as majorities in our own ancestral homeland.
[02:49:44.520 --> 02:49:48.182]  The number one baby name in London, Paris, and Berlin is Muhammad.
[02:49:48.602 --> 02:49:51.083]  For the next 100 years, Africa will still be African.
[02:49:51.544 --> 02:49:52.744]  Asia will still be Asian.
[02:49:53.264 --> 02:49:54.965]  The Middle East will still be Arab and Persian.
[02:49:55.386 --> 02:49:57.807]  But Europe will be Arab, African, and Muslim.
[02:49:58.280 --> 02:50:07.827]  If we do not wake up and stop the current trends of mass immigration and record low birth rates among Europeans, our grandchildren and great-grandchildren will be left destitute without homelands.
[02:50:08.307 --> 02:50:09.868]  This has been dubbed the Great Replacement.
[02:50:10.369 --> 02:50:12.850]  Lastly, Alex, don't believe for a second the U.S.
[02:50:12.891 --> 02:50:16.033]  is exempt from this demographic replacement.
[02:50:16.073 --> 02:50:21.837]  The 2020 Census will show whites as a minority for the first time in our nation's history.
[02:50:22.461 --> 02:50:24.643]  And this has massive political implications.
[02:50:43.308 --> 02:50:45.329]  The globalists are playing every group off against each other.
[02:50:45.409 --> 02:50:47.010]  And yes, they're teaching people to hate whites.
[02:50:47.030 --> 02:50:51.974]  They're trying to make brown people tribal and hate whites as another divide in Congress strategy.
[02:50:52.574 --> 02:50:54.055]  And so whites should stand up for themselves.
[02:50:54.135 --> 02:50:54.755]  Every group should.
[02:50:54.975 --> 02:50:59.478]  And of course, we're trying to bring in third world populations to undermine Western culture because they want to enslave us.
[02:50:59.498 --> 02:51:01.300]  The globalists have already totally enslaved those third world countries.
[02:51:01.780 --> 02:51:03.881]  But they've been hitting those third world countries with bioweapons as well.
[02:51:05.560 --> 02:51:09.941]  We all have red blood, and I want to unify us against the New World Order and against the globalists, okay?
[02:51:10.061 --> 02:51:15.743]  I don't put down people that want to stand up for themselves, and certainly they try to guilt whites, the globalists, too, so we submit to their agenda.
[02:51:15.763 --> 02:51:16.383]  We shouldn't do that.
[02:51:16.843 --> 02:51:19.764]  But I want to reach out to everybody and build a real human future.
[02:51:20.084 --> 02:51:21.384]  The AI is taking over.
[02:51:21.404 --> 02:51:23.325]  The globalists plan to make humans obsolete.
[02:51:23.585 --> 02:51:26.886]  We need to be unified as humans together against the New World Order.
[02:51:27.346 --> 02:51:27.586]  All right.
[02:51:28.706 --> 02:51:34.448]  I'm going to say this and then go to a special report that Rob New put together that's very, very important.
[02:51:36.678 --> 02:51:38.286]  Elmhurst Hospital in New York.
[02:51:39.210 --> 02:51:40.033]  But first I want to say this.
[02:51:41.747 --> 02:51:54.610]  We know this is a giant psychological warfare operation to see what we'll put up with, to see how they can scare us into giving up all of our rights and only letting big box stores continue to operate and setting up martial law.
[02:51:54.910 --> 02:51:55.870]  You heard the caller earlier?
[02:51:56.070 --> 02:52:00.631]  He called last Saturday during the emergency show and gave out intel that was dead on.
[02:52:00.911 --> 02:52:06.932]  He called in three weeks ago and said next Monday California's going on total lockdown because he was involved in the police uniforms.
[02:52:07.312 --> 02:52:09.193]  But we knew that was true from our own research as well.
[02:52:09.834 --> 02:52:13.076]  They just keep incrementally closing the noose around everybody's throat.
[02:52:13.776 --> 02:52:25.243]  And California is planning a total lockdown, saying grocery stores will only be open a few hours a day, and you're only allowed to stock up to create a destruction of confidence and total fear.
[02:52:25.284 --> 02:52:26.264]  It's not to stop the virus.
[02:52:26.624 --> 02:52:35.430]  And they are then going to start saying media is not essential, which is total maximum martial law, end of free speech, so the government can do whatever it wants in the blue cities and blue states.
[02:52:35.470 --> 02:52:36.411]  Trump is trying to buck it.
[02:52:37.179 --> 02:52:55.781]  But because America has gotten into the hysteria, and gotten into peer pressure, and gotten into doing what everybody else says, in China and Europe, and let the authoritarian set the precedent, Trump will be blamed for the deaths, and will probably go along with it, unless you put maximum pressure on him, on your neighbors, on everybody else, explaining the PSYOP to them, okay?
[02:52:58.112 --> 02:53:05.397]  And yes, it's going to get to a point where only major globalist stores, if they're able to push this much further, are able to ship products.
[02:53:05.817 --> 02:53:13.142]  You need to get your orders in now at infowarestore.com for vitamins and minerals and for the other great products.
[02:53:13.423 --> 02:53:15.084]  X3, still 60% off.
[02:53:15.584 --> 02:53:19.567]  And I told my main shipping guy, I said, I don't think we'll be allowed in three weeks to even ship stuff.
[02:53:19.867 --> 02:53:25.671]  So I said, 60%, I may go actually two costs, even go lower, just to get everything out so you have it.
[02:53:25.971 --> 02:53:26.211]  Okay?
[02:53:26.311 --> 02:53:26.712]  It's that bad.
[02:53:27.432 --> 02:53:28.292]  That's where they're going.
[02:53:28.332 --> 02:53:29.013]  We may stop them.
[02:53:29.253 --> 02:53:34.154]  But you need to get your orders in now at InfoWarsTore.com on X3.
[02:53:34.334 --> 02:53:35.095]  X2's sold out.
[02:53:35.195 --> 02:53:35.895]  X3's excellent.
[02:53:36.175 --> 02:53:37.455]  You need to get your Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[02:53:37.795 --> 02:53:39.336]  You need to get your DNA Force Plus.
[02:53:39.676 --> 02:53:40.996]  You need to get your Real Red Pill.
[02:53:41.317 --> 02:53:41.837]  It's all...
[02:53:42.977 --> 02:53:57.307]  50 to 60 percent off to get it out and to get it to you and your family and get extra food and get extra bullets and just get everything because if America goes along with this like we are, total depression, total lockdown and it'll never end, okay?
[02:53:57.527 --> 02:53:58.828]  This is the end of civilization.
[02:53:58.868 --> 02:54:02.170]  Kissinger says, you know, generations will be poor now.
[02:54:02.590 --> 02:54:06.673]  This is them taking the economy away from us because we fought their globalism and we said no.
[02:54:07.033 --> 02:54:10.636]  And the Democrats all said who are globalists, we're going to kill the economy to show you who's boss.
[02:54:10.976 --> 02:54:12.157]  These are monster demons.
[02:54:12.917 --> 02:54:33.944]  And so, above just getting the products you need at FortWorthStore.com to get money into us, too, to fund as long as we can to stay on air, you better get aggressive politically on the telephone, on the email, and in the streets, and telling folks, this is BS, we see through this, and all these other countries are open for business.
[02:54:34.044 --> 02:54:39.806]  President Brazil, he said, we're not shutting crap down, this is an attack on our economy, we're tough, and that's it.
[02:54:43.188 --> 02:54:43.868]  He understands it.
[02:54:44.048 --> 02:54:46.049]  We better understand it or we're going to lose everything.
[02:54:46.409 --> 02:54:48.149]  A nation of cowards will be slaves.
[02:54:48.609 --> 02:54:52.470]  I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing, for 6 p.m.
[02:54:52.630 --> 02:54:53.990]  and then back during the weekday shows.
[02:54:54.070 --> 02:54:57.471]  And who knows how much longer, folks, because this is the modern war.
[02:54:57.511 --> 02:54:58.271]  This is the takeover.
[02:54:58.311 --> 02:54:59.292]  You better get prepared.
[02:54:59.312 --> 02:55:00.152]  You better get your products.
[02:55:00.532 --> 02:55:01.572]  And then 4store.com.
[02:55:01.852 --> 02:55:05.013]  Ford all sells out the super blue toothpaste with the nano silver.
[02:55:06.189 --> 02:55:06.650]  I don't know.
[02:55:25.265 --> 02:55:27.166]  I know this audience is awake, but I'm spurring you.
[02:55:27.746 --> 02:55:30.567]  Every one of you better take this live feed right now and send emails out.
[02:55:30.627 --> 02:55:31.988]  Call people while you still can.
[02:55:32.288 --> 02:55:34.989]  AI is now blocking emails, blocking text in live time.
[02:55:35.330 --> 02:55:37.611]  And you better get aggressive and not be afraid of this system.
[02:55:37.891 --> 02:55:44.194]  You better get aggressive now and don't listen to Q where you shouldn't do anything and you shouldn't spread the word and you shouldn't wake folks up.
[02:55:44.274 --> 02:55:44.674]  BS!
[02:55:45.054 --> 02:55:50.080]  You're Americans and you're the Paul Reveres, not some imaginary, you know, phony guys back there.
[02:55:50.100 --> 02:55:51.502]  They're trying to hijack our resistance.
[02:55:51.943 --> 02:55:57.790]  We are going to win this together, but you've got to get the live feed out at Band.Video at Infowars.com forward slash show right now.
[02:55:58.050 --> 02:56:00.754]  And you've got to share the links and the articles while we're still up.
[02:56:00.774 --> 02:56:03.778]  You got to download these because in the future you won't be able to get them online.
[02:56:04.138 --> 02:56:06.621]  We better start saving them because people will listen later.
[02:56:06.701 --> 02:56:10.786]  If it totally goes down and we fail at this level, people are going to wake up more than ever.
[02:56:10.846 --> 02:56:13.990]  But you've got to have the original recordings so they understand.
[02:56:14.211 --> 02:56:15.893]  This could be a multi-generational fight.
[02:56:16.193 --> 02:56:17.795]  The robot AI takeover is here.
[02:56:18.015 --> 02:56:19.257]  The bioweapon attack is here.
[02:56:19.637 --> 02:56:21.520]  God bless you and good luck.
[02:56:22.832 --> 02:56:24.273]  And it's not going away.
[02:56:24.313 --> 02:56:25.574]  The demand is still there.
[02:56:25.614 --> 02:56:26.374]  It's not slowing down.
[02:56:26.414 --> 02:56:32.837]  As you can see behind me, this line, John, it started forming even earlier this morning and it's even longer at this hour.
[02:56:32.877 --> 02:56:34.839]  People waiting in the cold to get care.
[02:56:34.899 --> 02:56:44.884]  The hospital tells us every day they're working to increase the capacity of this hospital by flooding it with nurses and doctors and equipment just to keep up with this demand.
[02:56:45.404 --> 02:56:47.065]  I don't see... I've been here for an hour.
[02:56:47.625 --> 02:56:49.606]  Not one person has walked up to the tents.
[02:56:50.107 --> 02:56:50.767]  Not one.
[02:56:52.682 --> 02:56:55.986]  Okay, so and look at all the ambulances down the block.
[02:56:57.027 --> 02:56:58.129]  You see any ambulances?
[02:56:58.990 --> 02:57:03.195]  Look at more people are taking videos because no one's believing the fake media.
[02:57:04.235 --> 02:57:06.516]  You see all the ambulances that are on the block down there?
[02:57:06.956 --> 02:57:07.916]  They're all parked.
[02:57:08.216 --> 02:57:09.437]  They've been there for an hour.
[02:57:09.697 --> 02:57:13.518]  Elmhurst Hospital in Queens is now the epicenter of the five boroughs.
[02:57:13.598 --> 02:57:16.619]  So many people lined up to get testing, confirm cases there.
[02:57:16.919 --> 02:57:18.720]  Doctors and nurses are inundated.
[02:57:18.880 --> 02:57:22.201]  Elmhurst Hospital, as you said, has really become the hot zone.
[02:57:22.361 --> 02:57:28.083]  Every single day, patients are lining up outside here, many of them with cold and flu-like symptoms.
[02:57:28.103 --> 02:57:29.964]  They come here to be tested.
[02:57:30.244 --> 02:57:33.045]  I'm standing outside of the Elmhurst Hospital
[02:57:33.445 --> 02:57:33.925]  I don't see that.
[02:57:33.945 --> 02:57:35.467]  Here's those tents they had set up.
[02:58:05.191 --> 02:58:17.389]  With the growing number of patients as supplies dwindle, you can see barricades behind us set up here outside of the hospital to keep order here because so many have been lining up every day to get tested.
[02:58:17.409 --> 02:58:19.913]  13 people have died at this hospital in Queens.
[02:58:20.333 --> 02:58:25.819]  Outside, it's swamped with New Yorkers waiting in long lines to get tested for the coronavirus.
[02:58:26.300 --> 02:58:37.613]  The numbers in the city are still rapidly growing, but the nation's top infectious disease expert says studying what's happening here could give clues to help reduce infection rates in other parts of the country.
[02:58:37.913 --> 02:58:38.814]  It's accelerating.
[02:58:39.014 --> 02:58:45.079]  There are other parts of the country which we need to get a better feel for what is going on.
[02:58:45.560 --> 02:58:56.109]  And the way we do that is by increasing testing and identifying people who are infected, isolating them, getting out of circulation, and then do contact tracing.
[02:58:56.369 --> 02:59:02.234]  It doesn't matter what you say one week, two weeks, three weeks, you've got to go with what the situation on the ground is.
[02:59:41.909 --> 03:00:04.965]  I don't see anything wrong.
[03:00:57.836 --> 03:01:10.640]  Now I had told listeners back in December that we were not going to have 50% off on products anymore because there's not enough markup to fund our operation at that moment.
[03:01:11.530 --> 03:01:20.275]  This crisis is so serious, and despite the fact that we're going to be selling out of this very, very quickly, and we've done many other products, we're offering it at 50% off right now, because it's the right thing to do.
[03:01:20.855 --> 03:01:27.839]  And I'm taking X3, we already sold out of X2, and I'm going down to 60% off, even though it's going to be sold out in a couple weeks.
[03:01:28.399 --> 03:01:31.942]  Because, again, I just go with my gut, with my heart, and the right thing to do.
[03:01:32.142 --> 03:01:33.443]  I treat you like I'd like to be treated.
[03:01:33.463 --> 03:01:36.385]  I'm very appreciative of the listeners and viewers for supporting us.
[03:01:36.405 --> 03:01:38.427]  And so please, take advantage.
[03:01:38.447 --> 03:01:40.168]  You can get your DNA Force Plus 50% off.
[03:01:40.448 --> 03:01:42.209]  Get your X3, the 2-ounce bottles.
[03:01:42.229 --> 03:01:43.750]  The 1-ounce is about to sell out even faster.
[03:01:44.131 --> 03:01:44.591]  At 50% off.
[03:01:44.811 --> 03:01:46.773]  And we've got other amazing products.
[03:01:47.033 --> 03:01:48.194]  Real Red Pill Plus.
[03:01:48.214 --> 03:01:50.135]  And we've also got Living Defense.
[03:01:50.275 --> 03:01:51.116]  Just check them all out.
[03:01:51.136 --> 03:01:53.558]  They're all massively discounted at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:01:53.578 --> 03:01:54.959]  Whatever you do, take action!
[03:02:01.601 --> 03:02:05.223]  This ad will only run for a couple days because it's about to sell out.
[03:02:05.643 --> 03:02:07.564]  I noticed, hey, we had a lot of Prostagard.
[03:02:08.005 --> 03:02:08.545]  People love it.
[03:02:08.585 --> 03:02:09.285]  We've got a lot of it.
[03:02:09.666 --> 03:02:11.327]  Why is it suddenly almost sold out?
[03:02:11.927 --> 03:02:18.591]  And I went, oh my gosh, it's an incredible formula, not just for the prostate, the salt palmetto that's on record for helping that.
[03:02:19.191 --> 03:02:27.276]  It's got everything, vitamin D, a big dose of that, a big dose of zinc, a big dose of selenium, copper, chromium, and a bunch of other stuff.
[03:02:28.056 --> 03:02:28.997]  This is
[03:02:30.262 --> 03:02:41.945]  Perfect formula for what's going on right now and it's about to sell out at InfoWarsTore.com and I want you to have it so that after all this craziness passes, it becomes a normal regimen in your life because it's something, in my view, you need every day.
[03:02:42.445 --> 03:02:54.529]  Get it right now, Prostagard, at InfoWarsTore.com and whatever you do, please warn others that Mother Nature has given us a lot of things that really help boost our overall health and wellness.
[03:03:04.395 --> 03:03:04.835]  Warning.
[03:03:05.336 --> 03:03:05.776]  Warning.
[03:03:06.256 --> 03:03:06.697]  Warning.
[03:03:07.477 --> 03:03:09.459]  You are witnessing Blitzkrieg.
[03:03:10.239 --> 03:03:11.720]  AI takeover.
[03:03:12.201 --> 03:03:13.121]  Lightning war.
[03:03:13.682 --> 03:03:20.366]  The virus is the heavily scripted pretext to roll out the next quote advancement in civilization.
[03:03:20.807 --> 03:03:23.769]  The post-industrial, post-human world.
[03:03:24.569 --> 03:03:26.550]  You are in grave danger.
[03:03:27.230 --> 03:03:28.771]  You are being attacked.
[03:03:29.471 --> 03:03:31.012]  You are being targeted.
[03:03:31.692 --> 03:03:33.112]  The veil has been lifted.
[03:03:33.512 --> 03:03:37.954]  The New World Order is now coming for you and your family.
[03:03:38.554 --> 03:03:41.275]  You need to research State Department Memorandum 200.
[03:03:41.655 --> 03:03:45.537]  You need to research the Club of Rome, limits to population and growth.
[03:03:45.917 --> 03:03:51.119]  You need to research Rockefeller Foundation plan, lockstep and others.
[03:03:51.659 --> 03:03:53.460]  This is an emergency warning.
[03:03:53.920 --> 03:03:58.768]  There is a robot AI takeover already prepared and already in full swing.
[03:03:59.149 --> 03:04:03.275]  This is 21st century warfare, but humanity can resist it.
[03:04:03.475 --> 03:04:04.096]  Emergency!
