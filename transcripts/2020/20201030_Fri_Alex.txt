[00:00:06.095 --> 00:00:08.736]  It is Friday, October 30th.
[00:00:08.736 --> 00:00:10.457]  The year is 2020.
[00:00:10.457 --> 00:00:24.124]  We are now four days from an attempt by the Deep State, allied with Communist China, to initiate and ignite a civil war that will destroy our Republic.
[00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:27.165]  The Democrats have committed to carry this out.
[00:00:27.165 --> 00:00:33.708]  I got a call early this morning by a very well national known talk show host, and he said, have you seen what Pelosi just said?
[00:00:33.708 --> 00:00:34.269]  And I said, no.
[00:00:35.222 --> 00:00:39.364]  He said it confirms everything you're saying.
[00:00:39.364 --> 00:00:46.469]  I then clicked on my phone and watched the clip that he sent me and stumbled.
[00:00:46.469 --> 00:01:01.317]  As I was walking through my living room, Pelosi has come out and said, no matter what, no matter what, Joe Biden is going to be the president.
[00:01:01.317 --> 00:01:02.758]  A few months ago, she said this as well.
[00:01:02.758 --> 00:01:03.119]  She said,
[00:01:04.141 --> 00:01:05.122]  Does it matter?
[00:01:05.122 --> 00:01:07.464]  Even if he stays in the White House, we'll have our own inauguration.
[00:01:07.464 --> 00:01:10.587]  The White House isn't geographic.
[00:01:10.587 --> 00:01:12.949]  The presidency isn't geographic.
[00:01:12.949 --> 00:01:16.172]  So they're telling you they're going to contest and now they're saying even if President Trump
[00:01:16.926 --> 00:01:18.887]  Well, it's an impossible job.
[00:01:34.511 --> 00:01:37.052]  They give you impossible things, like COVID.
[00:01:37.052 --> 00:01:39.813]  Oh, the cases are way up, way up, but deaths aren't up.
[00:01:39.813 --> 00:01:45.935]  But as soon as the winter gets here, there'll be normal flu and pneumonia deaths, and they're saying, oh, there'll be triple COVID deaths by January.
[00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:50.957]  Well, of course there'll be triple what's currently dying, because they're going to count all the flu and all the other
[00:01:52.386 --> 00:01:53.707]  Pneumonias.
[00:01:53.707 --> 00:01:58.291]  These people are criminals that lie through statistics, ladies and gentlemen, and they know what they're doing.
[00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:00.794]  And now they tell you the mask is never coming off.
[00:02:00.794 --> 00:02:04.057]  Now martial law is being declared in Europe by the EU.
[00:02:04.057 --> 00:02:05.518]  People are fleeing to the countryside.
[00:02:05.518 --> 00:02:07.700]  Jihadis are allowed to murder at will.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.741]  It's all happening.
[00:02:08.741 --> 00:02:10.122]  We'll cover it in a moment.
[00:02:10.122 --> 00:02:10.923]  But ladies and gentlemen,
[00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:14.081]  This is civil war they're preparing.
[00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:18.264]  This is initiating a overthrow of the election.
[00:02:18.264 --> 00:02:19.986]  They tried four years ago.
[00:02:19.986 --> 00:02:26.732]  They're trying it again right now because they cannot deal with the huge awakening and all the crimes they've committed are coming out.
[00:02:26.732 --> 00:02:28.954]  There's huge new Hunter Biden developments.
[00:02:28.954 --> 00:02:29.895]  We're covering it all.
[00:02:29.895 --> 00:02:37.101]  But first, here's an important piece put together by Darren McBreen about why people stand stronger for Trump than ever under the incredible bullying.
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.742]  Why am I voting for Donald Trump?
[00:02:40.742 --> 00:02:41.944]  Because of you.
[00:02:41.944 --> 00:02:43.465]  I'm talking to you, liberals.
[00:02:43.465 --> 00:02:46.328]  You're the ones doing everything you can to destroy our country.
[00:02:46.328 --> 00:02:50.193]  You're the ones who want to destroy our culture, our history, and our heritage.
[00:02:50.193 --> 00:02:54.337]  You tear down our statues, you destroy our monuments, and you desecrate our heroes.
[00:02:54.337 --> 00:03:00.104]  You encourage and participate in the rioting and the looting and destruction of our cities.
[00:03:00.464 --> 00:03:05.527]  You call the protests peaceful, and then turn around and release the violent criminals back onto the streets.
[00:03:05.527 --> 00:03:07.028]  All charges dropped.
[00:03:07.028 --> 00:03:08.429]  What's wrong with you?
[00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:11.130]  All this while defunding our police.
[00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.673]  You want wide open borders and sanctuary cities for illegal migrants.
[00:03:15.673 --> 00:03:18.234]  What is it about illegal that you don't understand?
[00:03:18.234 --> 00:03:22.497]  You say I grew up with white privilege, but you don't know anything about me.
[00:03:22.497 --> 00:03:24.358]  Where I've been, the things I've seen.
[00:03:24.938 --> 00:03:26.500]  You don't know my history.
[00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.842]  You called me a white supremacist.
[00:03:28.842 --> 00:03:31.004]  You called me an Uncle Tom.
[00:03:31.004 --> 00:03:32.205]  I'm a Nazi?
[00:03:32.205 --> 00:03:33.046]  Seriously?
[00:03:33.046 --> 00:03:33.987]  Get out of here.
[00:03:33.987 --> 00:03:36.870]  You refused to accept the truth.
[00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.252]  You wouldn't know the truth if it hit you in the face.
[00:03:39.252 --> 00:03:40.833]  But it's worse than that.
[00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:42.815]  You censored the truth from getting out.
[00:03:43.536 --> 00:03:47.140]  You ridicule the people that speak the truth.
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.601]  Why do you have to be like this?
[00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:52.946]  You're the gullible sheep who trust the fake news mockingbird media.
[00:03:52.946 --> 00:03:56.550]  You think Jeffrey Epstein really did kill himself.
[00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:04.658]  You've infiltrated our universities and academia to brainwash our youth into thinking America is a racist country and that socialism is the answer.
[00:04:05.441 --> 00:04:06.402]  I don't think so.
[00:04:06.402 --> 00:04:09.423]  When I try to talk to you, you don't listen.
[00:04:09.423 --> 00:04:13.546]  When I want to have a conversation, you call me names, or block me out.
[00:04:13.546 --> 00:04:15.667]  How is that going to help anything?
[00:04:15.667 --> 00:04:16.847]  I don't get it.
[00:04:16.847 --> 00:04:20.429]  You're embarrassed to call yourself an American.
[00:04:20.429 --> 00:04:24.592]  We are proud of our country, and our heritage, and our culture.
[00:04:24.592 --> 00:04:29.975]  Like it or not, we are going to make America great again, again.
[00:04:29.975 --> 00:04:32.476]  Why are you voting for Hillary Clinton?
[00:04:32.476 --> 00:04:33.277]  Because of you.
[00:04:41.604 --> 00:04:45.306]  Make America great again, again.
[00:04:45.306 --> 00:04:48.148]  Make America great again, again.
[00:04:48.148 --> 00:04:49.529]  I'm going to add another again.
[00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:52.130]  This way I can sell you all an extra hat.
[00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:53.891]  It all goes to the kid.
[00:04:59.249 --> 00:05:00.070]  We're good to go!
[00:05:26.892 --> 00:05:26.992]  Yeah.
[00:05:44.353 --> 00:05:44.733]  We're good.
[00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.905]  The final countdown.
[00:06:15.905 --> 00:06:17.685]  The final countdown.
[00:06:17.685 --> 00:06:23.447]  Here we are, where we were four years ago, on the eve of that historic election.
[00:06:23.447 --> 00:06:26.188]  And now the stakes are even higher.
[00:06:26.188 --> 00:06:28.129]  Now the world is awakening to globalism.
[00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:36.652]  And the forces of globalism are striking back in incredibly vicious ways.
[00:06:36.652 --> 00:06:38.072]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:38.072 --> 00:06:40.053]  It is Friday, October 30th.
[00:06:40.053 --> 00:06:40.833]  The year is 2020.
[00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:42.514]  And then there's the 79 days
[00:06:45.228 --> 00:06:45.628]  Of course.
[00:07:08.516 --> 00:07:16.044]  Tank the dollar in the stock market, have race riots nationwide as the cover, and try to drive President Trump from office.
[00:07:16.044 --> 00:07:31.400]  The big corporations, the banks, Hollywood, the chi-coms, the Democrats, all of these systems, along with radical Islam and communist China, are allied against us right now.
[00:07:34.028 --> 00:07:46.524]  We have put together a historic compilation of intelligence that we're going to air in the next segment of the last four months where they set this up to launch it.
[00:07:47.455 --> 00:07:55.297]  We told you when they were in the secret phases that this was happening, but now they've prepared themselves, they've prepared the public, and they're going to make their move in four days.
[00:07:55.297 --> 00:07:57.957]  That's why they flooded us with the 80 million ballots.
[00:07:57.957 --> 00:07:59.578]  A lot of people got three or four ballots.
[00:07:59.578 --> 00:08:02.779]  Dead cats, dead dogs, dead people got them.
[00:08:02.779 --> 00:08:13.001]  So there's such a confusion level, so that even if Trump is winning by three, four points in battleground states, and statistically has a majority, and you can see there's a bunch of votes that haven't been cast,
[00:08:14.005 --> 00:08:16.307]  But still, he'd win if all of those went Democrat.
[00:08:16.307 --> 00:08:18.969]  They're going to say, we don't care, they're all going to be counted.
[00:08:18.969 --> 00:08:28.357]  And they put out so many millions of fake ones that he may never be able to get to that number because they'll never be able to count enough of the ballots to give him that clear victory.
[00:08:28.357 --> 00:08:41.668]  But Pelosi just signaled today that she is intending to contest the election no matter what, and even if Trump is the clear winner,
[00:08:42.901 --> 00:08:46.784]  He will not be inaugurated, and Joe Biden will be made the president.
[00:08:46.784 --> 00:08:50.127]  Now, I want that to sink in for you, for myself, for everybody.
[00:08:50.127 --> 00:08:54.270]  Because when I learned this this morning, it was staggering.
[00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:58.773]  She went on national television, and now it's coming in that she's made the statement again.
[00:08:58.773 --> 00:08:59.874]  So it's now a talking point.
[00:08:59.874 --> 00:09:01.856]  These videos are pouring in right now.
[00:09:03.243 --> 00:09:19.395]  That regardless if Trump wins, he will not be president and it will be Joe Biden and they will inaugurate him, meaning they'll have a consortium of blue states get together in a civil war and announce that they are seceding and that he is their president and they will geographically announce the breakup of the country.
[00:09:19.395 --> 00:09:21.737]  How do I know this?
[00:09:21.737 --> 00:09:27.561]  She said it three months ago on national television and then her surrogates all began parroting it as well.
[00:09:27.561 --> 00:09:31.044]  This is the UN CHICOM move to break up the country.
[00:09:32.179 --> 00:09:36.300]  Pelosi and Biden are just Chinese agents, totally compromised.
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:41.481]  They know that China will release info on them if they don't follow orders to destroy America.
[00:09:41.481 --> 00:09:42.481]  The Communist will.
[00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:48.062]  And they know that Trump and the Justice Department is starting to move in on them.
[00:09:48.062 --> 00:09:49.762]  And so now they're cornered, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:09:49.762 --> 00:09:53.043]  Here is Pelosi and what she said.
[00:09:53.043 --> 00:09:58.044]  Here it is.
[00:09:58.044 --> 00:09:58.884]  But we are ready.
[00:10:00.345 --> 00:10:09.470]  I feel very confident that Joe Biden will be elected president on Tuesday, whatever the end count is.
[00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:13.152]  But on the election that occurs on Tuesday, he will be elected.
[00:10:13.152 --> 00:10:19.996]  On January 20th, he will be inaugurated president of the United States.
[00:10:19.996 --> 00:10:23.858]  Now, let's go ahead and play that for you, for Radio Lizards and TV viewers.
[00:10:23.858 --> 00:10:24.698]  One more time.
[00:10:24.698 --> 00:10:26.199]  Listen to her very, very carefully.
[00:10:26.199 --> 00:10:28.220]  Here it is.
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.061]  But we are ready.
[00:10:30.518 --> 00:10:39.647]  I feel very confident that Joe Biden will be elected president on Tuesday, whatever the end count is.
[00:10:39.647 --> 00:10:43.230]  But on the election that occurs on Tuesday, he will be elected.
[00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.314]  On January 20th, he will be inaugurated president of the United States.
[00:10:50.851 --> 00:11:14.028]  Now notice, that's not a slip, that's what she's been saying for months, that it doesn't matter what the election says, we're not going to accept it, and then we're going to have states secede, and then we will seat him geographically from another location, and that geography doesn't matter, the White House doesn't matter, it matters who they say the President is.
[00:11:14.028 --> 00:11:19.372]  Just like they tell you that the Hunter Biden laptop, which his campaign admits is real, the FBI admits is real,
[00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:24.460]  It's Russian disinfo, and 51% of Americans in a poll believe that.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:29.822]  That's obviously a skewed poll, but there is a large portion that believe if somebody slips on a banana peel, the Russians did it.
[00:11:29.822 --> 00:11:34.303]  Because the Bidens, they couldn't ever do anything wrong.
[00:11:34.303 --> 00:11:42.365]  And of course they're telling you that Trump is to blame for the virus, and that we can never get out from under the virus again, and they're announcing all over the country.
[00:11:43.575 --> 00:11:43.675]  Yeah.
[00:12:05.787 --> 00:12:07.468]  That is now going statewide.
[00:12:07.468 --> 00:12:09.849]  So, it's been announced in France and England.
[00:12:09.849 --> 00:12:12.050]  You must have a cell phone tracked at all times.
[00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.830]  This is beyond 1984.
[00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:19.113]  The headline at Infowars.com and Newswars.com needs to be spread to the four winds.
[00:12:19.113 --> 00:12:20.874]  It is civil war is imminent.
[00:12:20.874 --> 00:12:24.976]  Democrats will not accept Trump victory, says Pelosi.
[00:12:27.116 --> 00:12:33.260]  That's why you'd cause a civil war is when a group says, we don't accept the election, we don't accept the president.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:42.486]  It happened before in the early 1860s with Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis, and you know the rest of what happened.
[00:12:42.486 --> 00:12:47.510]  And in that war, at least both sides had some serious beefs, and it was Americans fighting with each other.
[00:12:48.493 --> 00:12:52.796]  This is communist Chinese globalists funded to absolutely destroy the country.
[00:12:52.796 --> 00:12:55.018]  And I side with the voters.
[00:12:55.018 --> 00:12:58.160]  I side with President Trump.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.703]  I side with common sense and my family against the chi-coms and against the globalists.
[00:13:02.703 --> 00:13:07.366]  But everybody better understand, the globalists wouldn't be making this move if they didn't feel powerful.
[00:13:07.366 --> 00:13:14.671]  They're now announcing major email services will read your emails and will not let you have an email account if they disagree with what you're saying.
[00:13:14.671 --> 00:13:15.212]  That's in the news.
[00:13:16.903 --> 00:13:21.638]  They're now announcing text messages are being read by, starting with Facebook and others, and they're going to control that.
[00:13:23.231 --> 00:13:29.295]  If they see you saying you think President Trump won, then you're going to get in trouble with them.
[00:13:29.295 --> 00:13:31.297]  Well, you better not self-censor, folks.
[00:13:31.297 --> 00:13:35.360]  You better speak out now and say no and find services that won't act like this.
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:44.726]  And you better use email, that last way to communicate, and the telephone while you still can to call friends and family and direct them to electionnight.news.
[00:13:44.726 --> 00:13:45.727]  That's our new URL.
[00:13:45.727 --> 00:13:48.109]  They're not blocking now on Facebook and Twitter for now.
[00:13:48.109 --> 00:13:49.250]  They get blocked at mere hours.
[00:13:50.823 --> 00:13:52.544]  ElectionNight.News.
[00:13:52.544 --> 00:13:53.705]  ElectionNight.News.
[00:13:53.705 --> 00:14:09.334]  And everyone should sign up for our emergency election newsletter for the underground videos, the articles, the breaking intel, who's coming on, what's unfolding, so you can spread it at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:14:09.334 --> 00:14:12.135]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:14:12.135 --> 00:14:16.398]  We're going to add a link under the live show feed today with the headline,
[00:14:18.044 --> 00:14:27.928]  Civil War to that email page where you can sign up so that we can reach you with critical intel, Paul Revere, so you can spread it separately.
[00:14:27.928 --> 00:14:29.209]  There's going to be a lot of deaths from flu.
[00:14:29.209 --> 00:14:31.269]  There's going to be a lot of deaths from pneumonia, as there always is.
[00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:32.330]  We're so run down.
[00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:33.270]  We're so undernourished.
[00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:34.731]  We're so sickly in this country.
[00:14:34.731 --> 00:14:36.792]  We're so drugged out of our brains.
[00:14:36.792 --> 00:14:39.373]  I personally boost my body's natural defenses.

[00:15:07.570 --> 00:15:10.152]  50% off, even though it was sold out for months.

[00:15:13.775 --> 00:15:18.379]  The highest quality, strongest organic mustard seed derived selenium.
[00:15:18.379 --> 00:15:21.982]  Essential to electrochemical activity and all cellular function.
[00:15:21.982 --> 00:15:24.484]  These are the things the globalists don't want you to have.
[00:15:24.484 --> 00:15:27.506]  These are the things that they fought to keep you from even knowing about.
[00:15:27.506 --> 00:15:31.849]  The average American doesn't even know you die without vitamin C or vitamin D3.
[00:15:31.849 --> 00:15:33.651]  Or that you die without iodine.
[00:15:34.051 --> 00:15:44.235]  And they don't want you to know the UN even admits over 2 billion people have lower cognitive operation because of iodine deficiency and are... It's the number one cause of mental disability is iodine deficiency.
[00:15:44.235 --> 00:15:46.016]  The globalists take it out of everything on purpose.
[00:15:46.016 --> 00:15:47.956]  They're murdering slime criminals.
[00:15:47.956 --> 00:15:51.958]  They want you dumb and stupid so they can slowly kill you with all these viruses they're producing.
[00:15:53.063 --> 00:15:54.303]  Go to Infowarsstore.com.
[00:15:54.303 --> 00:15:57.764]  It supports the broadcast and gets you essential vitamins and minerals, water filtration, air filtration.
[00:15:57.764 --> 00:16:01.765]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[00:16:01.765 --> 00:16:02.525]  Me too.
[00:16:02.525 --> 00:16:09.647]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling, there's one thing almost everyone agrees on.
[00:16:09.647 --> 00:16:13.628]  It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death.
[00:16:14.028 --> 00:16:15.929]  You probably already believe that.
[00:16:15.929 --> 00:16:16.930]  I certainly do.
[00:16:16.930 --> 00:16:17.870]  So here's the thing.
[00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:26.775]  I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[00:16:26.775 --> 00:16:32.198]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at StrongerDefense.com.
[00:16:32.198 --> 00:16:33.259]  No cures or treatments there.
[00:16:33.559 --> 00:16:42.768]  Instead, little known but shocking immune system research and a breakthrough immune support product based on that research called Immune 10X.
[00:16:42.768 --> 00:16:43.689]  And the best part?

[00:16:57.423 --> 00:17:05.733]  Attention radio listeners, if you're concerned about the coming chaos after the November elections, this will be an extremely important message.
[00:17:05.733 --> 00:17:06.614]  Here's why.
[00:17:06.614 --> 00:17:13.543]  No matter what the outcome in November, catastrophic social upheaval is a very real possibility.
[00:17:13.543 --> 00:17:14.825]  Here's why this is important.
[00:17:15.205 --> 00:17:23.467]  Listen, we all know that silver and gold have been historic hedges against the uncertain waves of social chaos and unstable currencies.
[00:17:23.467 --> 00:17:32.589]  But did you know that there's been times in the past, during times of extreme hardship, when Americans put another store of value above even silver and gold?
[00:17:32.589 --> 00:17:33.289]  It's true.
[00:17:33.289 --> 00:17:40.030]  Open-pollinated seeds have been and could very well be the ultimate store of value in the coming hard times ahead.
[00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:43.771]  Go to survivalseedbank.com to get heirloom seeds below wholesale.
[00:17:44.011 --> 00:17:49.401]  Visit SurvivalSeedBank.com this week and get hundreds of dollars in free bonuses.

[00:18:13.923 --> 00:18:17.426]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[00:18:17.426 --> 00:18:20.689]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[00:18:20.689 --> 00:18:24.252]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[00:18:24.252 --> 00:18:26.494]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[00:18:26.494 --> 00:18:27.895]  I suggest Band.Video.
[00:18:28.576 --> 00:18:34.038]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[00:18:34.038 --> 00:18:42.501]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[00:18:42.501 --> 00:18:49.203]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[00:18:49.203 --> 00:18:52.024]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[00:18:58.496 --> 00:19:02.341]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[00:19:02.341 --> 00:19:06.667]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[00:19:06.667 --> 00:19:15.178]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[00:19:15.518 --> 00:19:32.150]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[00:19:32.150 --> 00:19:43.178]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[00:19:43.678 --> 00:19:52.164]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[00:19:52.164 --> 00:20:01.011]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:20:01.011 --> 00:20:03.653]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:28.648 --> 00:20:29.968]  Four days, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:29.968 --> 00:20:32.028]  Four days, my friends.
[00:20:32.028 --> 00:20:35.749]  Four days, my fellow patriots.
[00:20:35.749 --> 00:20:38.069]  You have lived to see it.
[00:20:38.069 --> 00:20:45.311]  World government, the whole anti-human, pedophile, satanic agenda, rising.
[00:20:45.311 --> 00:20:55.113]  But we're also seeing massive awakening and people that didn't think we were accurate, at the lowest levels and the highest levels of civilization, are now completely converting to reality.
[00:20:57.697 --> 00:21:05.524]  Now, I'm going to play this seven minute compilation that is proof of criminal conspiracy and proof of criminals preparing the public.
[00:21:05.524 --> 00:21:14.632]  Because if you've got a public conspiracy, you have to first get your operatives in line, you have to test balloon it, you have to beta test it, and then you roll it out.
[00:21:14.632 --> 00:21:22.780]  And so this is Pelosi and Hillary Clinton and all of them in the last three, four months preparing the public
[00:21:24.133 --> 00:21:26.954]  For the event that breaks the country up, which is the globalist goal.
[00:21:26.954 --> 00:21:37.696]  It's break the country up, it's devalue the dollar, it's bring in world government, it's kill US superpower status to make room for the EU and communist China to then absorb the United States.
[00:21:37.696 --> 00:21:45.678]  Then we come back, a special report I just shot, we're premiering here on air, of total proof, total proof,
[00:21:47.321 --> 00:21:51.988]  That is coming out of what's really on the laptop of Hunter Biden.
[00:21:51.988 --> 00:21:54.531]  Giuliani confirming, indeed, it is pedophilia.
[00:21:54.531 --> 00:21:56.134]  It is rape of children.
[00:21:56.134 --> 00:21:57.676]  That is coming up next segment.
[00:21:57.676 --> 00:21:59.038]  Spread the word, Paul Reveres.
[00:21:59.038 --> 00:22:00.220]  Now, here is the open treason.
[00:22:01.337 --> 00:22:17.784]  One of the things that I think we and other media need to start doing is preparing the American people that there's nothing illegitimate about this election taking additional days or even weeks to make sure that all the votes are counted.
[00:22:17.784 --> 00:22:22.487]  In fact, that might be important to make sure that this is a legitimate and fair election.
[00:22:22.487 --> 00:22:29.950]  The reason we talk about a red mirage is in fact because we believe that on election night we are going to see Donald Trump in a stronger position.
[00:22:30.670 --> 00:22:42.738]  You know, Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out and eventually, I do believe he will win if we don't give an inch and if we are as focused and relentless as the other side is.
[00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:12.334]  You have a result on election night where it appears that Donald Trump has won, but a result after ballots are counted that show that Joe Biden has actually won.
[00:23:12.334 --> 00:23:13.034]  That's right.
[00:23:13.034 --> 00:23:20.317]  We essentially built a simulator where it's a sequence of sliders, and you just pull those sliders to start seeing what the scenarios will show you.
[00:23:20.317 --> 00:23:21.897]  What's it going to look like on election night?
[00:23:21.897 --> 00:23:24.878]  What's it going to look like the day after, and the day after that, and the day after that?
[00:23:24.878 --> 00:23:26.959]  So if one of the candidates
[00:23:27.859 --> 00:23:33.068]  And any of the races claims victory before there's a consensus result.
[00:23:33.872 --> 00:23:42.556]  Then we're going to add some informational context to that post directly saying that there's no consensus result yet.
[00:23:42.556 --> 00:23:49.060]  We see in the data that twice as many voters intend to cast a ballot by mail than have ever before.
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:53.102]  They are disproportionately Joe Biden supporters.
[00:23:53.102 --> 00:23:59.825]  We might have the results saying something on the evening of November 3rd that it will not say the evening of November 10th.
[00:24:00.245 --> 00:24:16.489]  My advice to Joe Biden, and I've told the campaign this, obviously, is do not concede under any circumstances because I believe the other side is going to cheat and sneak and try to do everything they can.
[00:24:16.489 --> 00:24:18.310]  He's not going to leave if he loses.
[00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:23.834]  The fact is, whether he knows it yet or not, he will be leaving.
[00:24:23.834 --> 00:24:33.560]  Just because he might not want to move out of the White House doesn't mean we won't have an inauguration ceremony to inaugurate a duly elected President of the United States.
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:35.041]  But there is a process.
[00:24:35.041 --> 00:24:45.288]  It has nothing to do with that the certain occupant of the White House doesn't feel like moving and has to be fumigated out of there because the presidency is the presidency.
[00:24:45.288 --> 00:24:47.970]  It's not geography or location.
[00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:51.152]  This president is going to try to steal this election.
[00:24:51.152 --> 00:24:55.315]  This is the guy who said that all mail-in ballots are fraudulent.
[00:24:55.315 --> 00:25:02.301]  Have you ever considered what would happen if the election result came out as you being the winner and Trump refused to leave?
[00:25:02.301 --> 00:25:03.262]  Yes, I have.
[00:25:03.262 --> 00:25:04.343]  I was so damn proud.
[00:25:04.343 --> 00:25:09.307]  Here you have four chiefs of staff coming out and ripping the skin off of Trump.
[00:25:10.290 --> 00:25:17.477]  And you have so many rank-and-file military personnel saying, whoa, we're not a military state.
[00:25:17.477 --> 00:25:19.119]  This is not who we are.
[00:25:19.119 --> 00:25:24.444]  I promise you, I'm absolutely convinced they will escort him from the White House with great dispatch.
[00:25:25.074 --> 00:25:37.640]  It has been suggested that this is a trial run for the President of the United States, who may be organizing to not accept what happens when we have the election.
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:40.482]  If he's not elected, is he going to pull out?
[00:25:41.306 --> 00:25:42.647]  His military?
[00:25:42.647 --> 00:25:44.307]  Is he going to engage us?
[00:25:44.307 --> 00:25:49.910]  He has already alluded to there may be a civil war if he's not re-elected.
[00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:51.371]  This is dangerous.
[00:25:51.371 --> 00:25:54.292]  We are trying to find out more about it.
[00:25:54.292 --> 00:26:03.856]  And sadly, the domestic enemies to our voting system and our honoring our Constitution are right at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
[00:26:03.856 --> 00:26:05.777]  It's really actually shameful.
[00:26:05.777 --> 00:26:07.178]  Enemies of the state.
[00:26:07.546 --> 00:26:14.771]  Without exaggeration, President Trump's counterintelligence vulnerabilities are exponentially greater than any president in modern history.
[00:26:14.771 --> 00:26:17.632]  So do you think the president is a national security threat?
[00:26:17.632 --> 00:26:18.133]  I do.
[00:26:18.133 --> 00:26:24.557]  This administration, this president has demonstrated that they have a capacity to go lower than we can even possibly imagine.
[00:26:24.557 --> 00:26:27.499]  So yeah, I think we have to be concerned about that.
[00:26:27.499 --> 00:26:34.003]  His attempt to talk about mail-in voting and all the fraud that is associated with it is factually incorrect.
[00:26:34.003 --> 00:26:35.604]  He's just trying to set up a
[00:26:36.184 --> 00:26:36.644]  We're good to go.
[00:26:58.961 --> 00:27:15.398]  I think that this is important because there is, unfortunately, I think, a heightened risk of civil unrest in the period between voting and a result being called or after that.
[00:27:15.398 --> 00:27:22.265]  And I just think that we need to be doing everything that we can to reduce the chances of violence or civil unrest in the wake of this election.
[00:27:23.072 --> 00:27:32.754]  If you think things cannot possibly get worse, trust me, they can and they will if we don't make a change in this election.
[00:27:32.754 --> 00:27:42.136]  And if we don't meet this moment, we will continue to have these persistent injustices in our communities.
[00:27:42.136 --> 00:27:50.158]  And we will continue to have unrest in our streets because there's been unrest in people's lives.
[00:27:50.857 --> 00:27:56.038]  Today we are lifting up these stories in the hopes that you will see the light!
[00:27:56.038 --> 00:27:59.219]  And if you don't, we will bring the fire!
[00:27:59.219 --> 00:28:00.380]  Thank you!
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:04.081]  This is a movement, I'm telling you, they're not going to stop.
[00:28:04.081 --> 00:28:07.922]  And everyone beware, because they're not going to stop.
[00:28:07.922 --> 00:28:12.283]  They're not going to stop before Election Day in November, and they're not going to stop after Election Day.
[00:28:12.813 --> 00:28:16.278]  And that should be, everyone should take note of that on both levels.
[00:28:16.278 --> 00:28:19.363]  That this isn't, they're not going to let up and they should not.
[00:28:19.363 --> 00:28:20.745]  And we should not.
[00:28:20.745 --> 00:28:22.948]  And yeah, I am radical.
[00:28:22.948 --> 00:28:27.135]  I do believe that we need to get radical about what we are doing and take it seriously.
[00:28:27.135 --> 00:28:28.276]  I'm looking to the public.
[00:28:28.897 --> 00:28:50.445]  You know, this is as much about public outcry and organizing and mobilizing and applying pressure so that this GOP-led Senate and that these governors that continue to carry water for this administration, putting the American people in harm's way, turning a deaf ear to the needs of our families and our communities, hold them accountable.
[00:28:52.076 --> 00:28:55.318]  Well, make the phone call, send the email, show up.
[00:28:55.318 --> 00:28:58.159]  You know, there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest.
[00:28:58.159 --> 00:29:03.741]  CNN and the rest of the corporate media are running with the false headline that Trump has surrendered to the coronavirus.
[00:29:03.741 --> 00:29:04.462]  It's the opposite.
[00:29:04.462 --> 00:29:13.346]  He's not surrendering to the endless drumbeat of fear and false science that it's incredibly deadly and that we have a chance of eradicating it.
[00:29:13.846 --> 00:29:22.208]  Bill Gates, Fauci, and the UN have said, we will always wear masks, we will never shake hands, and even the vaccines won't protect us forever.
[00:29:22.208 --> 00:29:30.289]  And so that civilization, as we know, is over until every coronavirus in the world is eradicated?
[00:29:30.289 --> 00:29:31.709]  That's impossible.
[00:29:31.709 --> 00:29:32.270]  That's right.
[00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.290]  They're trying to say they have to have a cure for the common cold.
[00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:39.151]  That's what COVID-19 false positives for on the test.
[00:29:39.631 --> 00:29:42.713]  They created a problem that can never be defeated.
[00:29:42.713 --> 00:29:45.055]  But of course, they're the ones in charge of the problem.
[00:29:45.055 --> 00:29:55.801]  And so they stay in power forever and take control of society with contact tracers now going with the police to people's doors in Texas at gunpoint and taking force samples.
[00:29:55.801 --> 00:29:59.003]  We must say no.
[00:29:59.003 --> 00:30:01.885]  Something huge has happened in the last two weeks.
[00:30:01.885 --> 00:30:04.427]  Remember when Hunter Biden's laptop first broke?
[00:30:05.714 --> 00:30:13.637]  And all of big tech in concert from Twitter to Facebook to YouTube, Google, all worked to block it.
[00:30:13.637 --> 00:30:14.717]  They didn't deny that it was real.
[00:30:14.717 --> 00:30:23.480]  They just wouldn't let anybody even talk about the story or link to major newspapers or even the House and Senate committees that were looking at it.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:33.644]  Well now fast forward as the firehose information comes out and more tapes get released and more audio with Hunter admitting he was a communist Chinese agent.
[00:30:33.644 --> 00:30:35.285]  We're not trying to censor it anymore.
[00:30:35.285 --> 00:30:41.368]  Not because they're good people, but because the Streisand effect boomeranged on their traitorous butts last time.
[00:30:42.128 --> 00:30:43.390]  Just a few weeks ago.
[00:30:43.390 --> 00:30:46.273]  And so now they know that trying to suppress it only makes it bigger.
[00:30:46.273 --> 00:30:49.476]  Just like they've done with Infowars and Bandai Video.
[00:30:49.476 --> 00:30:50.377]  It's truly amazing.
[00:30:50.377 --> 00:30:51.859]  So keep telling the truth.
[00:30:51.859 --> 00:30:53.181]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[00:30:53.181 --> 00:30:56.705]  Amazing things are happening and these communist Chinese agents are going to pay!
[00:30:58.376 --> 00:31:02.640]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.841]  And why is that?
[00:31:03.841 --> 00:31:11.647]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree-like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds.
[00:31:11.647 --> 00:31:16.131]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[00:31:16.131 --> 00:31:17.432]  They didn't know why.
[00:31:17.432 --> 00:31:23.177]  Well, with modern science we know it's one of the purest, cleanest organic forms of selenium.
[00:31:23.757 --> 00:31:35.242]  We have BioTrue Selenium, sold out for months, back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com at 50% off, store-bought shipping, and triple patriot points.
[00:31:35.242 --> 00:31:44.767]  BioTrue Selenium at InfoWarsStore.com is an amazing product, and it's even more amazing in that it funds our operation.
[00:31:44.767 --> 00:31:47.268]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it.
[00:31:47.268 --> 00:31:49.609]  It is an essential nutrient in the body
[00:31:49.969 --> 00:31:51.372]  You absolutely have to have.
[00:31:51.372 --> 00:31:52.774]  It's back in stock.
[00:31:52.774 --> 00:31:53.275]  50% off.
[00:31:53.275 --> 00:31:57.903]  Triple Patriot points at InfoWarshaw.com and with free shipping.
[00:31:57.903 --> 00:31:59.365]  In January and February.
[00:32:00.347 --> 00:32:10.394]  Of the year 2020, the communist super state China, working through the United Nations, told the world how we are now supposed to live our lives after COVID.
[00:32:10.394 --> 00:32:21.982]  Permanent social distancing, permanent masks, apps to track everywhere we go and what we do, contact tracers coming to our doors with the police and dragging us away.
[00:32:21.982 --> 00:32:25.785]  This is the authoritarian medical tyranny takeover.
[00:32:26.465 --> 00:32:30.269]  And it's never going to end until we start standing up and saying no.
[00:32:30.269 --> 00:32:38.098]  Already Fauci and the WHO and the Communist Chinese are all over the news saying the lockdowns are permanent.
[00:32:38.098 --> 00:32:42.583]  Bill Gates said at least 10 years last week until restrictions are raised.
[00:32:42.583 --> 00:32:45.966]  By then we'll all be totally and completely trained.
[00:32:46.787 --> 00:32:49.168]  To live under slavery and it will never end.
[00:32:49.168 --> 00:32:51.590]  This is the authoritarian takeover.
[00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:53.391]  Everyone must resist.
[00:32:53.391 --> 00:32:54.832]  Everyone must speak up.
[00:32:54.832 --> 00:33:02.016]  Everyone must say no now.
[00:33:02.016 --> 00:33:04.637]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:23.974 --> 00:33:25.075]  InfoWars.
[00:33:25.075 --> 00:33:26.276]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:33:26.276 --> 00:33:29.258]  Today.
[00:33:29.258 --> 00:33:33.921]  President Trump just confirmed what Rudolph Giuliani has been laying out.
[00:33:33.921 --> 00:33:37.263]  They are set to release what we broke two weeks ago.
[00:33:37.263 --> 00:33:41.706]  Evidence of Hunter Biden engaged in sex acts with underage minors.
[00:33:41.706 --> 00:33:43.927]  And it's all breaking right now.
[00:33:43.927 --> 00:33:48.410]  And we have what's called the laptop from hell.
[00:33:48.410 --> 00:33:49.351]  The laptop from hell.
[00:33:50.205 --> 00:33:54.327]  From what I've understood, you only have seen a tiny portion of it.
[00:33:54.327 --> 00:33:56.068]  But you know what the press is now doing?
[00:33:56.068 --> 00:33:58.330]  They're blaming Russia!
[00:33:58.330 --> 00:34:00.191]  It's Russia that did it!
[00:34:00.191 --> 00:34:03.973]  Russia's the one that created the laptop!
[00:34:03.973 --> 00:34:05.994]  I told you there are underage girls there.
[00:34:05.994 --> 00:34:07.015]  There are.
[00:34:07.015 --> 00:34:11.417]  I told you there are documents that show that he's getting 10%.
[00:34:11.417 --> 00:34:12.258]  There are.
[00:34:12.258 --> 00:34:15.580]  There are documents that show that he's getting half of what Hunter gets.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:15.780]  There are.
[00:34:23.092 --> 00:34:26.195]  You can say what you want about Rudolph Giuliani.
[00:34:26.195 --> 00:34:28.917]  He was pro-war when I wasn't pro-war.
[00:34:28.917 --> 00:34:35.402]  But no one can deny that he is a former respected federal prosecutor that brought down the mob in New York.
[00:34:35.402 --> 00:34:43.409]  He is not the steel dossier that the Clintons paid for that was proven to be fake day one and never showed one real piece of evidence.
[00:34:43.409 --> 00:34:45.530]  So when Giuliani came out two weeks ago,
[00:34:46.491 --> 00:34:56.517]  With Chinese dissidents who had seen the laptop and reported that it showed pedophilia, showed illegal acts with Hunter Biden and others, you knew it was accurate.
[00:34:56.517 --> 00:34:58.959]  He's never put out defamation like that.
[00:34:58.959 --> 00:35:01.721]  That would destroy his name forever.
[00:35:01.721 --> 00:35:04.422]  Then the media tried to claim, oh, it's Russian disinfo.
[00:35:04.422 --> 00:35:04.763]  But U.S.
[00:35:04.763 --> 00:35:08.985]  intelligence came out and said, no, it's real from this laptop shop in Delaware.
[00:35:08.985 --> 00:35:12.548]  And so now, two weeks later, they don't deny that the laptop is real.
[00:35:13.248 --> 00:35:15.029]  They just hope you forget about it.
[00:35:15.029 --> 00:35:16.250]  But it's not just the laptop.
[00:35:16.250 --> 00:35:28.519]  In a moment we're going to play the audio that came out over a week ago with no coverage, which is confirmed, the Bidens haven't denied it, of Hunter Biden talking about getting a million bucks from the head of Chinese intelligence.
[00:35:28.519 --> 00:35:34.663]  He talks about how the Southern District of New York is investigating him in a criminal case and how scared he is.
[00:35:36.135 --> 00:35:37.596]  All of this is happening.
[00:35:37.596 --> 00:35:51.348]  And then on top of it, National File came out over a week ago, they've confirmed this is accurate as well, with Joe Biden's daughter talking about sexual abuse and other bizarre behavior, drug abuse, you name it.
[00:35:51.348 --> 00:35:59.135]  This is a family of very degenerate, insane drug addicts who are clearly mentally ill.
[00:35:59.135 --> 00:36:01.417]  And that's why they're the perfect group for corrupt
[00:36:02.566 --> 00:36:07.211]  Organizations in the US and in China to recruit them and control them.
[00:36:07.211 --> 00:36:10.295]  So here's what Giuliani said two weeks ago.
[00:36:10.295 --> 00:36:14.880]  A clip of this is on our video seen more than 3.3 million times at Bandai Video.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:21.467]  And then we'll play a large part of the exchange where Giuliani was on with Lisa Kennedy on Fox News last night.
[00:36:22.208 --> 00:36:30.014]  And she was trying to say, again, he's like the Steele dossier that's been proven to be total fraud, when what he's laid out has been proven to be real.
[00:36:30.014 --> 00:36:43.304]  Because the media can't deny this information, they can just try to call it disinformation without ever actually addressing it, because this information will bring down not just the Bidens, but the entire deep state.
[00:36:43.304 --> 00:36:48.708]  And when you look at these photographs that are disgusting and horrible, the Chinese have every single one of them.
[00:36:49.915 --> 00:36:53.859]  Chinese have every single one of them, probably 10 times more.
[00:36:53.859 --> 00:37:01.868]  Because what the Chinese government has been doing, and a country that's totally undefended against this, is setting Biden up.
[00:37:01.868 --> 00:37:04.831]  Putting him in a position where he's totally compromised.
[00:37:04.831 --> 00:37:08.375]  They've now given him so much money, he's totally compromised.
[00:37:08.375 --> 00:37:10.437]  They now have pictures of his son doing things that...
[00:37:12.659 --> 00:37:14.481]  Doing things that I can't describe.
[00:37:14.481 --> 00:37:15.743]  Some of which are illegal.
[00:37:15.743 --> 00:37:18.626]  And some could say that you were acting like Christopher Steele.
[00:37:18.626 --> 00:37:19.287]  Kennedy?
[00:37:19.287 --> 00:37:24.434]  That you were abstracting information and because... You've got to be kidding me.
[00:37:24.434 --> 00:37:26.016]  I was acting like Christopher Steele?
[00:37:26.016 --> 00:37:26.897]  That's what it sounds like.
[00:37:26.897 --> 00:37:29.960]  When you look at the people... You better apologize for that.
[00:37:31.068 --> 00:37:37.612]  I mean, I've been a United States Attorney, Associate Attorney General, Mayor of New York City, and a member of the Bar for 50 years.
[00:37:37.612 --> 00:37:41.454]  I've never been accused of anything, and you're accusing me of being Christopher Steele?
[00:37:41.454 --> 00:37:51.220]  I'm accusing you of acting in a capacity similar to Christopher Steele, and that you are going back and forth between Ukraine and the United States.
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:56.103]  What you are saying is an outrageous defamation of me!
[00:37:57.188 --> 00:37:59.148]  Of my reputation.
[00:37:59.148 --> 00:38:01.309]  Every single thing is here.
[00:38:01.309 --> 00:38:03.669]  And I want you to look at it, and then you apologize to me.
[00:38:03.669 --> 00:38:06.150]  I would love to look at it.
[00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:14.531]  Well, you can come to my office, and you can look at it, and tomorrow night you can apologize to me for saying I'm like Christopher Steele.
[00:38:14.531 --> 00:38:16.571]  I told you there are underage girls there.
[00:38:16.571 --> 00:38:17.571]  There are.
[00:38:17.571 --> 00:38:21.992]  I told you there are documents that show that he's getting 10%.
[00:38:21.992 --> 00:38:22.812]  There are.
[00:38:22.812 --> 00:38:26.153]  There are documents that show that he's getting half of what Hunter gets.
[00:38:26.153 --> 00:38:26.573]  There are.
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:31.585]  And when they're there, I want you to apologize to me because you just defamed me.
[00:38:31.585 --> 00:38:31.966]  Absolutely.
[00:38:31.966 --> 00:38:35.230]  And that's outrageous because you have no basis for that.
[00:38:35.230 --> 00:38:41.779]  I came on your show in good faith to give you evidence that is being withheld from the American people and I get defamed.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:44.200]  That's outrageous!
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:46.941]  We are only a few days away from the election.
[00:38:46.941 --> 00:38:59.324]  And my White House sources, as well as Fox News sources, tell me that by tomorrow, more information is about to break concerning the Hunter Biden laptop that dwarfs anything that's been released so far.
[00:38:59.324 --> 00:39:02.765]  And we have what's called the laptop from hell.
[00:39:03.877 --> 00:39:05.617]  A laptop from hell.
[00:39:05.617 --> 00:39:09.698]  From what I've understood, you only have seen a tiny portion of it.
[00:39:09.698 --> 00:39:19.320]  Also breaking, James Rosen of Sinclair Broadcasting is now reporting that a criminal investigation by the FBI has officially been opened into the Biden crime family.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:32.063]  A Justice Department official confirmed to Sinclair that back in 2019, the FBI opened up a criminal investigation into Hunter Biden and his associates that is focused on allegations of money laundering and remains open and active today.
[00:39:33.012 --> 00:39:38.674]  We're about to play audio of Hunter Biden talking about working with the head of Chinese intelligence.
[00:39:38.674 --> 00:39:46.176]  And now, emails have been confirmed to be his, where he gives wiring instructions to the Chi Com spy chief on where to send the money.
[00:39:46.176 --> 00:39:52.978]  Ladies and gentlemen, history is happening right now, and this entire house of criminal cards is coming down.
[00:39:52.978 --> 00:40:02.201]  I get calls from my father to tell me that the New York Times is calling, but my old partner Eric, who literally has done me harm for I don't know how long,
[00:40:02.651 --> 00:40:07.412]  Is the one taking the calls because my father will not stop sending the calls to Eric?
[00:40:07.412 --> 00:40:26.535]  I have another New York Times reporter calling about my representation of the, literally, Dr. Patrick Coe, the f***ing spy chief of China, who started the company that my partner, who was worth $323 billion, founded.
[00:40:31.536 --> 00:40:32.737]  It is now missing.
[00:40:32.737 --> 00:40:38.042]  The richest man in the world is missing, who was my partner.
[00:40:38.042 --> 00:40:48.972]  He was missing since I last saw him in his $58 million apartment and signed a $4 billion deal to build the largest LNG port in the world.
[00:41:00.984 --> 00:41:06.075]  Has named me as a witness without telling me?
[00:41:06.075 --> 00:41:07.779]  In a criminal case?
[00:41:07.779 --> 00:41:08.381]  And my father?
[00:41:08.991 --> 00:41:10.372]  Without telling me?
[00:41:10.372 --> 00:41:26.762]  We're only four days out from the most historic election in world history, and to see big tech attempting to censor this information is absolutely damning evidence that they are colluding with and working with not just the traitors in our government and the bureaucracy, but the communist Chinese themselves.
[00:41:26.762 --> 00:41:37.168]  But we, the American people, understood what was happening when the censorship intensified three years ago, and we set up organizations like Ban.Video, where this report and others are hosted.
[00:41:37.608 --> 00:41:44.832]  So you can share it on your email, share it on your instant message and share it by word of mouth and also on Facebook, Twitter, Google, and you name it.
[00:41:44.832 --> 00:41:49.935]  But if you don't share this information, Biden has a chance of being able to steal this election.
[00:41:49.935 --> 00:41:52.477]  So please research this info for yourself.
[00:41:52.477 --> 00:41:59.361]  There's so much more that we can't even have time to cover and then get it out to everyone you know, because you are the modern Paul Reveres.
[00:41:59.361 --> 00:42:02.603]  Whether you be black, white, old or young, I salute you.
[00:42:02.603 --> 00:42:03.864]  Good luck and God bless.
[00:42:05.086 --> 00:42:08.789]  We told you what was going to happen, and it did.
[00:42:08.789 --> 00:42:11.090]  Now we're telling you what's coming.
[00:42:19.795 --> 00:42:24.078]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed.
[00:42:24.078 --> 00:42:25.258]  And why is that?
[00:42:25.258 --> 00:42:33.063]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree-like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds.
[00:42:33.063 --> 00:42:37.566]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[00:42:37.566 --> 00:42:38.847]  They didn't know why.
[00:42:38.847 --> 00:42:44.591]  Well, with modern science we know it's one of the purest, cleanest organic forms of selenium.
[00:42:45.191 --> 00:42:56.687]  We have BioTrue Selenium sold out for months, back in stock at InfowarsStore.com at 50% off, store ride free shipping, and triple Patriot points.
[00:42:56.687 --> 00:43:00.693]  BioTrue Selenium 2020 is here, and whether Trump wins or loses...
[00:43:01.634 --> 00:43:12.805]  We have all won by exposing the communist Chinese, by exposing the globalists, by exposing the pedophile rings, by exposing the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil.
[00:43:12.805 --> 00:43:16.829]  Now I'm personally a Christian and I believe in God and I know God's real and I've experienced it in my life.
[00:43:16.829 --> 00:43:22.674]  But even if you don't believe in God, it's important to recognize that there is good in this world, there is evil.
[00:43:22.674 --> 00:43:25.917]  And there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing bad.
[00:43:26.858 --> 00:43:36.722]  And what I see happening across the spectrum of different political views is people finally get that, they finally understand that they're not being naive anymore.
[00:43:36.722 --> 00:43:42.365]  Don't ever project your decency and your goodness onto other people until they've proven what
[00:43:42.745 --> 00:43:43.206]  I don't know.
[00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:08.658]  The problem with social Darwinism is the so-called elites, the most cunning, smart, inventive people, believe that chivalry doesn't exist anymore.
[00:44:08.658 --> 00:44:13.562]  They don't believe in being aristocrats, trying to hold up civilization and empower the people.
[00:44:13.562 --> 00:44:18.165]  And once the establishment has that predatory idea, civilization collapses very, very quickly.
[00:44:18.165 --> 00:44:23.409]  You can't treat the least of us like garbage and not treat your own family like that.
[00:44:23.409 --> 00:44:25.831]  And so it is this lack of empathy that's going to destroy us.
[00:44:27.177 --> 00:44:36.832]  The globalists can try to be heartless devil-worshippers that commit rituals of all sorts of horrible crime, try to get away from the humanity, but really they can't escape the laws of the universe.
[00:44:36.832 --> 00:44:41.600]  They may train themselves to commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves, but
[00:44:42.421 --> 00:44:47.944]  The repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and the very structure itself.
[00:44:47.944 --> 00:44:50.085]  Wealth is created by loving God.
[00:44:50.085 --> 00:44:52.286]  Wealth is created by having a connection to God.
[00:44:52.286 --> 00:44:55.068]  God is the source of all creation, all success, all power.
[00:44:55.068 --> 00:44:57.029]  If you deny that, you'll be destroyed.
[00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:03.554]  Two Info Wars best-selling products are now back in stock for being sold out for months.
[00:45:03.554 --> 00:45:09.739]  BioTree Selenium from the mustard seed, essential in all electrochemical activity of the cells in the body.
[00:45:09.739 --> 00:45:11.701]  That's every human activity.
[00:45:11.701 --> 00:45:17.146]  And on top of it, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% Cucuminoid.
[00:45:17.146 --> 00:45:19.968]  Leading competitors have 3 to 5%.
[00:45:19.968 --> 00:45:25.153]  The things that turmeric does, I don't have to tell you, this is the highest quality, the strongest you're going to find.
[00:45:25.153 --> 00:45:26.614]  So both of these are amazing products.
[00:45:27.074 --> 00:45:28.915]  And they fund the Infowar, which is a 360 win.
[00:45:57.454 --> 00:46:04.577]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when it comes to the show?
[00:46:04.577 --> 00:46:22.164]  And it's the fact that InfoWars, more than 25 years ago, doing basic research with what the Club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying, developed the hypothesis that communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[00:46:22.164 --> 00:46:23.425]  Well, now China owns the debt.
[00:46:23.425 --> 00:46:26.186]  Now China owns Hollywood, all the one-sided trading deals.
[00:46:26.906 --> 00:46:31.549]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on, but again, it wasn't that hard.
[00:46:31.549 --> 00:46:37.172]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't want to focus on that issue.
[00:46:37.172 --> 00:46:41.695]  We did, and you focused on it by supporting us at InfoWars.
[00:46:41.695 --> 00:46:52.762]  So when you go to InfoWarsStore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts, films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world what's really happening.
[00:46:52.762 --> 00:46:54.563]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[00:46:54.563 --> 00:46:55.584]  I want to thank you for your support.
[00:47:01.514 --> 00:47:18.320]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:19.161]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:19.161 --> 00:47:20.541]  Because there is a war on.
[00:47:20.541 --> 00:47:21.182]  Or you're mine.
[00:47:40.515 --> 00:47:42.236]  Treason has a sound.
[00:47:42.236 --> 00:47:44.257]  It has a sound.
[00:47:44.257 --> 00:47:47.318]  Here it is.
[00:47:47.318 --> 00:47:49.619]  But we are ready.
[00:47:49.619 --> 00:47:58.743]  I feel very confident that Joe Biden will be elected president on Tuesday, whatever the end count is.
[00:47:58.743 --> 00:48:02.405]  But on the election that occurs on Tuesday, he will be elected.
[00:48:02.405 --> 00:48:06.407]  On January 20th, he will be inaugurated president of the United States.
[00:48:09.244 --> 00:48:18.533]  You know, we can unpack that for the whole show, and we will be, but let's just think about, if you're a TV viewer, what you saw there.
[00:48:18.533 --> 00:48:23.058]  You've not seen Pelosi give a speech in a mask, have you?
[00:48:23.058 --> 00:48:28.243]  And suddenly, if you watch the Weather Channel, or CNN, or MSNBC, or any channel,
[00:48:30.424 --> 00:48:40.912]  Now even on Comedy Central this morning, I was flipping through the channels, they had a host on there Skyping into a show, Zooming into a show, I don't know which one, wearing a mask.
[00:48:40.912 --> 00:48:44.294]  Remember what the UN said?
[00:48:44.294 --> 00:48:45.735]  You should wear a mask in your house.
[00:48:45.735 --> 00:48:48.798]  You should wear a mask when you have sex.
[00:48:48.798 --> 00:48:50.299]  Don't look at someone in the eyes.
[00:48:50.299 --> 00:48:51.500]  That could transmit the virus.
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:52.160]  I'm not joking.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:54.122]  England says don't look at someone.
[00:48:54.122 --> 00:48:59.626]  So now Don Lemon is wearing his mask on TV.
[00:49:02.014 --> 00:49:08.216]  So, they're like, okay, the public caught Pelosi going to the barber, going to the salon, and they caught all the other Democrats not wearing their masks.
[00:49:08.216 --> 00:49:08.596]  What do we do?
[00:49:08.596 --> 00:49:20.300]  Well, to make them look really scared, we tell them hospitals are full again, we tell them there's record numbers of cases, though it's not record numbers of deaths, and we scare them again.
[00:49:20.300 --> 00:49:27.823]  And they've got all these Democrats dressed up like Grim Reapers all over the country, in Texas and in New York and in Michigan and in
[00:49:29.076 --> 00:49:38.103]  Colorado and in Florida, it's all over the news, like, people are like, I'm the Grim Reaper of COVID, thanks for not wearing your mask, I'm gonna kill you.
[00:49:38.103 --> 00:49:42.567]  Because they know that people don't know science.
[00:49:42.567 --> 00:49:47.551]  220,000 dead, most of them died of flu, cold, car wrecks, gunshots.
[00:49:47.551 --> 00:49:49.033]  They've already run their scam, they've been caught.
[00:49:49.810 --> 00:49:51.811]  And they're going to do it again now, the winners here.
[00:49:51.811 --> 00:49:52.452]  That's what they say.
[00:49:52.452 --> 00:49:55.613]  Oh, by January, there'll be triple the daily deaths there is now.
[00:49:55.613 --> 00:49:58.055]  Well, of course, because you'll call every... It's in the headlines.
[00:49:58.055 --> 00:50:01.937]  Suddenly, no one's dying of flu worldwide.
[00:50:01.937 --> 00:50:03.818]  Because they add flu in the column now.
[00:50:03.818 --> 00:50:05.819]  We broke that eight months ago.
[00:50:05.819 --> 00:50:09.662]  This is criminal, organized fraud.
[00:50:09.662 --> 00:50:17.446]  So now, whether it's the Weather Channel, you name it, I'm here for the hurricane, wearing my... inside my truck, and I'm wearing my mask, because I'm a virgin singer.
[00:50:17.446 --> 00:50:18.867]  Because the executives are telling them,
[00:50:20.953 --> 00:50:36.461]  Not only do you go out and stand in the wind when it's not as fast as they claim it is and act like you're being blown away and people walk by normally right beside you showing it's a hoax, but you also wear your little mask.
[00:50:36.461 --> 00:50:38.062]  Because you're good and we're bad.
[00:50:38.062 --> 00:50:39.043]  And what does that mean?
[00:50:39.043 --> 00:50:41.324]  The same mask wearers will take the forced inoculation.
[00:50:42.708 --> 00:50:45.590]  The same mask wearers will handle the contact tracing.
[00:50:45.590 --> 00:50:47.251]  The same mask wearers will submit.
[00:50:47.251 --> 00:50:51.853]  And I predicted Michigan would be the first state, because I saw Whitmer being protected.
[00:50:51.853 --> 00:50:53.214]  I saw her being lifted up.
[00:50:53.214 --> 00:50:55.555]  I saw her making outrageous claims.
[00:50:55.555 --> 00:51:02.139]  And now, the Michigan universities are all announcing, you'll have a phone issued by the university you pay for.
[00:51:02.139 --> 00:51:04.881]  If you leave the campus in a semester, you'll be expelled.
[00:51:04.881 --> 00:51:05.981]  Everything you do is being tracked.
[00:51:05.981 --> 00:51:09.123]  You can only buy food at certain facilities that are approved by them.
[00:51:09.123 --> 00:51:10.684]  That's the real model, the real goal.
[00:51:12.076 --> 00:51:19.468]  And now Whitmer's saying to go to restaurants, you must give your name and number and have a cell phone that's scanned to get into them.
[00:51:19.468 --> 00:51:21.051]  Of course, you can see all that already happening.
[00:51:21.051 --> 00:51:22.413]  This is a global plan.
[00:51:22.413 --> 00:51:23.515]  It's already in Australia.
[00:51:23.515 --> 00:51:24.477]  It's already in Spain.
[00:51:24.477 --> 00:51:25.258]  It's already in the UK.
[00:51:27.116 --> 00:51:28.877]  And now it's here.
[00:51:28.877 --> 00:51:34.518]  How cool it is to wear a mask over your face, because you're dirty, and you're bad, and you're a biohazard.
[00:51:34.518 --> 00:51:42.980]  You're bad for the Earth, you're a bad species, you're evil, and what comes out of you is bad, and we gotta put a muzzle on you.
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:44.621]  Talk about cult programming!
[00:51:47.554 --> 00:51:49.537]  So every store I go in now, I'm not wearing the mask.
[00:51:49.537 --> 00:51:56.146]  And I have a discussion with the manager, and I explain it to them, and they agree with me, but say, sir, though, I'll get fired.
[00:51:56.146 --> 00:52:00.552]  Well, you know, you're going to get a lot more than fired if you keep going along with all of this.
[00:52:02.025 --> 00:52:03.086]  So here's the bottom line.
[00:52:03.086 --> 00:52:06.568]  If you go to InfoWars.com, we just showed you that incredible report.
[00:52:06.568 --> 00:52:13.672]  The last report we put out along those same lines two weeks ago got 3.5 million views and had a big effect and they had national news stories about it.
[00:52:13.672 --> 00:52:19.495]  Totally upset and totally angry that we still have a platform that circumvents them.
[00:52:19.495 --> 00:52:25.699]  But if you go to InfoWars.com or Band.Video, there's the headline.
[00:52:25.699 --> 00:52:26.319]  Devastating.
[00:52:29.008 --> 00:52:34.791]  Giuliani confirms child porn pedophilia on Hunter Biden's laptop.
[00:52:34.791 --> 00:52:38.694]  And they've given it to the media, but no one wants to publish it because it is child porn.
[00:52:38.694 --> 00:52:41.776]  No one wants to look at it because it is child porn.
[00:52:41.776 --> 00:52:45.698]  You talk about a psychological virus, but I've talked to all the folks that have seen it.
[00:52:46.949 --> 00:52:47.929]  I don't.
[00:52:47.929 --> 00:52:48.789]  I'm not looking at it.
[00:52:48.789 --> 00:52:49.810]  My crew's not looking at it.
[00:52:49.810 --> 00:52:51.510]  I've told them don't look at it.
[00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:54.130]  Because it could be a crime to even look at it.
[00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:55.871]  But we've talked to the people that have seen it.
[00:52:55.871 --> 00:52:57.131]  The FBI confirms they've got it.
[00:52:57.131 --> 00:52:57.991]  They did have it.
[00:52:57.991 --> 00:53:02.132]  Hunter Biden is under criminal investigation for China deals and for Burisma deals.
[00:53:02.132 --> 00:53:02.972]  That's now broke.
[00:53:02.972 --> 00:53:04.792]  But it's all back of the newspaper.
[00:53:04.792 --> 00:53:08.113]  And they go, oh, it's a Russian disinfo.
[00:53:08.113 --> 00:53:10.413]  Let's put that article back up on screen, please.
[00:53:10.413 --> 00:53:12.894]  If you, the listeners, get excited as the Paul Revere's.
[00:53:14.585 --> 00:53:24.027]  And if you share the video, devastating, Giuliani confirms, child porn, pedophilia on Hunter Biden's laptop, it will destroy the enemy.
[00:53:24.027 --> 00:53:26.667]  But they block InfoWars.com on Twitter and Facebook.
[00:53:26.667 --> 00:53:32.349]  They block, now, 2020ElectionCenter.com, but that got out for two months.
[00:53:32.349 --> 00:53:37.350]  Well now the same URL takes you to Band.Video, ElectionNight.News.
[00:53:37.350 --> 00:53:38.690]  ElectionNight.News.
[00:53:39.974 --> 00:53:40.815]  Get it.
[00:53:40.815 --> 00:53:42.377]  Go to electionnight.news.
[00:53:42.377 --> 00:53:44.399]  Find all the different videos you want.
[00:53:44.399 --> 00:53:49.585]  It'll be electionnight.news forward slash the video.
[00:53:49.585 --> 00:53:54.470]  Share the links with the share button from there and just get to work, folks.
[00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:55.852]  You want to take down the New World Order?
[00:53:55.852 --> 00:53:57.113]  Attack, attack, attack.
[00:53:57.113 --> 00:53:58.315]  You want to be defeated?
[00:53:58.315 --> 00:53:59.376]  Lay there.
[00:53:59.376 --> 00:54:00.537]  I see all these grown men I know.
[00:54:01.581 --> 00:54:08.164]  Playing video games and playing ping-pong and, and I get it, I play video games and ping-pong sometimes too to forget what's going on.
[00:54:08.164 --> 00:54:10.085]  But they don't do any politics.
[00:54:10.085 --> 00:54:15.408]  They don't do any marching or demonstrating or vlogging or writing or speaking.
[00:54:15.408 --> 00:54:23.291]  They just do nothing but go home and play video games and... This is a real video game for the rest of your life.
[00:54:23.291 --> 00:54:26.833]  The globals are trying to kill the dollar, break the country and end our whole future.
[00:54:28.376 --> 00:54:31.659]  And they're blocking everyone, even in their emails now, in live time.
[00:54:31.659 --> 00:54:32.881]  Totally draconian.
[00:54:32.881 --> 00:54:34.222]  They're coming for you.
[00:54:34.222 --> 00:54:35.803]  Not just Donald Trump or Alex Jones.
[00:54:35.803 --> 00:54:37.525]  They're trying to go through us to get to you.
[00:54:37.525 --> 00:54:38.446]  You're their target.
[00:54:38.446 --> 00:54:39.627]  You're their primary target.
[00:54:39.627 --> 00:54:41.869]  So fight back.
[00:54:41.869 --> 00:54:44.452]  On your email list say, this is a forbidden information.
[00:54:44.452 --> 00:54:47.195]  This is what they're censoring.
[00:54:47.195 --> 00:54:49.517]  This is what they didn't want Joe Rogan to have on.
[00:54:49.517 --> 00:54:51.219]  Use stuff like that that's popular and big.
[00:54:52.842 --> 00:54:55.064]  See what Alex wasn't able to cover on Joe Rogan.
[00:54:55.064 --> 00:54:57.767]  Say stuff like that in the email, and they'll open it, and it's having a huge effect.
[00:54:57.767 --> 00:55:05.414]  I mean, instead of getting 5 million views a week, like when we first started Banned.Video, it's been getting like 15 million views a week because of you.
[00:55:05.414 --> 00:55:09.739]  Which again, I don't even have advertising for outside third parties on there.
[00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:14.463]  With us, we sell product here to pay for the bandwidth to change the world and get that out.
[00:55:14.463 --> 00:55:16.005]  We just want to defeat the New World Order.
[00:55:17.335 --> 00:55:22.078]  So ElectionNight.News, ElectionNight.News, that's the new URL to spread.
[00:55:22.078 --> 00:55:32.285]  We're going to be here Election Night with Steven Crowder and with Robert Barnes and with Rex Jones and with a bunch of gigantic, huge special guests.
[00:55:32.285 --> 00:55:33.926]  So much big stuff coming up.
[00:55:33.926 --> 00:55:35.827]  So many huge things happening.
[00:55:35.827 --> 00:55:37.248]  The average video gets about
[00:55:38.757 --> 00:55:40.278]  100,000 views or so.
[00:55:40.278 --> 00:55:40.839]  But look at those.
[00:55:40.839 --> 00:55:42.680]  Some of those have a million views.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:43.681]  3.5 million views.
[00:55:43.681 --> 00:55:45.282]  I mean, that is crazy.
[00:55:45.282 --> 00:55:51.267]  Outside of the power-structured system, that we are doing that thanks to you, and I salute you all and thank you.
[00:55:51.267 --> 00:55:54.950]  Also, the censorship's going towards total.
[00:55:54.950 --> 00:56:03.997]  It may get to a point where our studio's even shut down, and I've got to shoot a video myself and upload it to my email server, which I've got set up to still get info to you, but I've got to be able to contact you.
[00:56:05.256 --> 00:56:09.660]  Infowars.com forward slash newsletter for our emergency election newsletter.
[00:56:09.660 --> 00:56:12.763]  Infowars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:56:12.763 --> 00:56:14.565]  Go there now.
[00:56:14.565 --> 00:56:22.373]  Sign up, get the key alerts, get a lot of its exclusive videos and articles that are underground intel, and send it out to everybody you know.
[00:56:22.373 --> 00:56:24.515]  Because this is true Paul Revere stuff.
[00:56:25.643 --> 00:56:28.345]  This is everything coming to a head right now.
[00:56:28.345 --> 00:56:29.045]  Okay.
[00:56:29.045 --> 00:56:29.666]  Okay.
[00:56:29.666 --> 00:56:34.329]  I want to hit the massive worldwide martial law lockdown too, now official, now being announced.
[00:56:34.329 --> 00:56:36.310]  Incredible stuff next hour.
[00:56:36.310 --> 00:56:40.473]  I want to hit the ultra massive news of all over California.
[00:56:40.473 --> 00:56:44.975]  They're saying the government's handing out free plywood saying, board up your shops.
[00:56:44.975 --> 00:56:45.936]  There's going to be riots.
[00:56:45.936 --> 00:56:51.280]  The police are going to stand down under Democrat orders and hope a chain reaction happens.
[00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:54.682]  Walmart removes gun ammunition from shelves in preparation for election unrest.
[00:56:55.785 --> 00:56:57.148]  It's all coming up next hour.
[00:56:57.148 --> 00:56:59.272]  And again, thank you local radio stations.
[00:56:59.272 --> 00:57:04.762]  You're the reason we're still on air under the boycotts and under the lockdowns and under the censorship.
[00:57:06.072 --> 00:57:08.273]  They never thought about how we're on hundreds of radio stations.
[00:57:08.273 --> 00:57:09.474]  God bless those radio stations.
[00:57:09.474 --> 00:57:11.795]  Tell folks about those local radio stations and support them.
[00:57:11.795 --> 00:57:13.016]  Become sponsors.
[00:57:13.016 --> 00:57:16.158]  Support your sponsors or tithe to them.
[00:57:16.158 --> 00:57:19.600]  They're doing more than local churches fighting the market of the beast and abortion.
[00:57:19.600 --> 00:57:20.661]  So is Trump.
[00:57:20.661 --> 00:57:24.643]  So send a donation every month to that local station or become a sponsor.
[00:57:24.643 --> 00:57:25.023]  Whatever.
[00:57:25.023 --> 00:57:26.804]  Take action.
[00:57:26.804 --> 00:57:29.546]  Separately, BioTru Selenium is so good for your whole body.
[00:57:29.546 --> 00:57:30.146]  Essential.

[00:58:02.265 --> 00:58:06.609]  InfoWars has been banned.
[00:58:06.609 --> 00:58:06.969]  Arrested.
[00:58:06.969 --> 00:58:13.314]  Attacked and threatened.
[00:58:13.314 --> 00:58:15.056]  Because we are effective.
[00:58:15.056 --> 00:58:18.459]  The Great Awakening is here.
[00:58:18.459 --> 00:58:20.100]  Go to band.video.

[00:58:48.726 --> 00:58:56.596]  InfoWars has been reporting on the dark, unpleasant truths of big government corruption for over two decades.
[00:58:56.596 --> 00:58:58.638]  It is why they attack us.
[00:58:58.638 --> 00:59:02.783]  And it is why we are now the most banned broadcast in the world.
[00:59:03.993 --> 00:59:08.756]  The Hunter Biden hard drive scandal is merely the tip of the iceberg.
[00:59:08.756 --> 00:59:16.821]  Evil has infested governments everywhere, but the evil establishment is censoring content across all media platforms.
[00:59:16.821 --> 00:59:20.843]  They blocked you from sharing banned dot video on social media.
[00:59:20.843 --> 00:59:26.846]  So go to election night dot news and share it like your lives depended on it.
[00:59:28.376 --> 00:59:36.622]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID, vaccines, Bill Gates and Big Pharma.
[00:59:36.622 --> 00:59:44.087]  Go to electionnight.news to find all the information the crooked establishment is most afraid of.
[00:59:44.087 --> 00:59:51.512]  Go to electionnight.news and share now.
[00:59:51.512 --> 00:59:54.134]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:00.265 --> 01:00:01.045]  Welcome back!
[01:00:01.045 --> 01:00:03.826]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:00:03.826 --> 01:00:14.451]  So, before Tucker Carlson announced it, I told you a few days ago that not just Tucker Carlson reportedly, but others that were having their mail broken into, their phones listened to, stuff stolen.
[01:00:14.451 --> 01:00:17.052]  And I can tell you that's been happening to a lot of other people.
[01:00:17.052 --> 01:00:25.635]  But because of security reasons, we don't want to talk about what people have been able to do successfully, because that gives them targeting information.
[01:00:25.635 --> 01:00:27.796]  But let's just say it's been going on.
[01:00:27.796 --> 01:00:29.557]  But suddenly, UPS
[01:00:30.968 --> 01:00:42.608]  After the media made fun of Tucker Carlson saying their mail was being robbed, the people were spying on their mail, suddenly the information was confirmed because they could go back to their cameras and find out who actually did steal it.
[01:00:42.608 --> 01:00:43.850]  So they got the information back.
[01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:44.170]  Here it is.
[01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:48.742]  Last night we told you about a pretty weird experience we had this week.
[01:00:48.742 --> 01:00:55.024]  On Monday, one of our producers in New York overnighted a package to our executive producer Justin Wells and to me in Los Angeles.
[01:00:55.024 --> 01:01:00.265]  We were there preparing for an interview with a former Biden family business partner called Tony Bobulinski.
[01:01:00.265 --> 01:01:03.226]  Somewhere along the way, the contents of that package disappeared.
[01:01:03.226 --> 01:01:07.387]  Inside it was a flash drive that contained primary documents pertaining to the Biden family.
[01:01:08.007 --> 01:01:14.750]  We should tell you those documents did not come from Tony Bobulinski, and of course, we made a copy of those files before we sent them because we're careful.
[01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:20.152]  We get a lot of documents from a lot of different sources all the time, but that's especially true in election years.
[01:01:20.152 --> 01:01:27.315]  Before we put them on the air, we have to determine first whether they're real, these were real, whether they're newsworthy, and whether it's legal to show them.
[01:01:27.315 --> 01:01:29.636]  We wanted to assess what we had, and we're still assessing it.
[01:01:30.236 --> 01:01:32.577]  But the point is the package never arrived.
[01:01:32.577 --> 01:01:40.159]  Proprietary reporting on the Biden family, documents sent between journalists by supposedly secure overnight mail, disappeared.
[01:01:40.159 --> 01:01:45.461]  And they vanished on the same day we were conducting a heavily publicized interview based in part on documents from the Biden family.
[01:01:46.261 --> 01:01:48.843]  So as you can imagine, we wanted to know what happened.
[01:01:48.843 --> 01:01:50.745]  Unfortunately, we still don't know what happened.
[01:01:50.745 --> 01:01:56.109]  This morning, UPS issued a press release announcing they had found our flash drive and then boasting about their customer service.
[01:01:56.109 --> 01:02:01.974]  Quote, UPS will always focus first on our customers and will never stop working to solve issues.
[01:02:01.974 --> 01:02:03.015]  Which is fine.
[01:02:03.015 --> 01:02:04.716]  UPS is a reliable company.
[01:02:04.716 --> 01:02:06.357]  They rarely lose anything.
[01:02:06.357 --> 01:02:07.198]  We agree with that.
[01:02:07.198 --> 01:02:09.240]  That's why we used them in the first place.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.401]  And yet they lost our Biden documents.
[01:02:11.401 --> 01:02:11.582]  How?
[01:02:12.634 --> 01:02:14.436]  UPS won't tell us how.
[01:02:14.436 --> 01:02:16.357]  We spent a lot of the day talking to executives there.
[01:02:16.357 --> 01:02:22.862]  They claimed that the flash drive was found on Monday night by an hourly employee at the UPS building on 43rd Street in Manhattan.
[01:02:22.862 --> 01:02:25.524]  They suggested it might have been sitting on the floor there.
[01:02:25.524 --> 01:02:33.831]  They couldn't prove that because, remarkably, in a room where millions of high-value packages are handled, there are no security cameras.
[01:02:33.831 --> 01:02:35.292]  That's what they told us.
[01:02:35.292 --> 01:02:39.736]  UPS says the employee who found our flash drive simply dropped it on top of a supervisor's desk.
[01:02:40.436 --> 01:02:46.219]  Our documents sat there undiscovered for more than 24 hours until we announced on television that they were missing.
[01:02:46.219 --> 01:02:47.640]  That's their story.
[01:02:47.640 --> 01:02:51.943]  Obviously we had some questions about it, but UPS executives did not answer our questions.
[01:02:51.943 --> 01:02:54.004]  Quote, there are no more details.
[01:02:54.004 --> 01:02:55.244]  Security is returning it.
[01:02:55.244 --> 01:02:59.187]  Apologies again that we were unable to deliver it next day at the service level you requested.
[01:03:00.103 --> 01:03:02.105]  Our exchanges went on like this for hours.
[01:03:02.105 --> 01:03:04.467]  And the main question we had never changed.
[01:03:04.467 --> 01:03:08.751]  How did our flash drive get separated from the package that we sent it in?
[01:03:08.751 --> 01:03:10.853]  That seemed like something worth knowing.
[01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:12.154]  The envelope was securely sealed.
[01:03:12.154 --> 01:03:12.635]  We know that.
[01:03:12.635 --> 01:03:16.658]  Two witnesses saw our producer seal it, and UPS does not dispute that.
[01:03:16.658 --> 01:03:19.741]  Was the package torn open accidentally by a machine?
[01:03:19.741 --> 01:03:20.722]  That seems unlikely.
[01:03:20.722 --> 01:03:22.444]  UPS says that almost never happens.
[01:03:23.191 --> 01:03:25.793]  So we're left with the obvious explanation.
[01:03:25.793 --> 01:03:33.059]  Someone, for some reason, opened our package and removed a flash drive containing documents that were damaging to the Biden family.
[01:03:33.059 --> 01:03:34.980]  We'd love to know who would do that and why.
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:41.405]  It would be helpful to see the envelope itself, but UPS says we can't see it because they threw it away.
[01:03:41.405 --> 01:03:42.106]  So here we are.
[01:03:42.106 --> 01:03:44.188]  We got our flash drive back today, and that's great.
[01:03:44.188 --> 01:03:46.650]  What we'd really like are some answers.
[01:03:47.731 --> 01:03:53.894]  And speaking of answers, it occurs as reading this that we mentioned the documents that we get from a lot of people.
[01:03:53.894 --> 01:03:57.996]  And we've received an awful lot of documents recently about Hunter Biden.
[01:03:57.996 --> 01:03:59.557]  We haven't aired all of them.
[01:03:59.557 --> 01:04:01.318]  In fact, many we have not aired.
[01:04:01.318 --> 01:04:09.122]  The ones that are pertinent to his business career abroad, favors he did on behalf of foreign clients with the help of his father, that seems relevant.
[01:04:09.642 --> 01:04:13.465]  And it seems like news, and we brought it to you, and we're not ashamed of that.
[01:04:13.465 --> 01:04:19.710]  But there are a lot of documents about Hunter Biden's personal life that we haven't brought to you, and we're not going to, and we should tell you why.
[01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:21.091]  One is the obvious answer.
[01:04:21.091 --> 01:04:22.392]  He's not running for president.
[01:04:22.392 --> 01:04:26.616]  And so to the extent those documents pertain to his dad, of course.
[01:04:26.616 --> 01:04:29.899]  But Hunter Biden is a fallen man at this point.
[01:04:29.899 --> 01:04:32.441]  And I should also say that I knew Hunter Biden fairly well.
[01:04:32.441 --> 01:04:34.843]  We lived near each other in Washington for quite some time.
[01:04:34.843 --> 01:04:37.405]  I knew his wife, who was an absolutely outstanding person, a good person.
[01:04:38.311 --> 01:04:39.891]  I never thought Hunter Biden was a bad person.
[01:04:39.891 --> 01:04:44.133]  I thought he had demons, but in the time I knew him, he kept them mostly under control.
[01:04:44.133 --> 01:04:47.374]  At some point he lost control of those demons, and the world knows that now.
[01:04:47.374 --> 01:04:49.374]  He's now humiliated and alone.
[01:04:49.374 --> 01:04:55.396]  It's probably too strong to say we feel sorry for Hunter Biden, but the point is, pounding on a man, jumping on, piling on.
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:05:03.745]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired and even worshipped for thousands of years by ancient civilizations.
[01:05:03.745 --> 01:05:07.128]  With modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular.
[01:05:07.128 --> 01:05:14.133]  Its antioxidant effect, its anti-inflammatory effect, everything it does is simply amazing.
[01:05:14.133 --> 01:05:17.675]  And most turmerics out there are simply food products.
[01:05:17.675 --> 01:05:23.719]  They're 3-5% curcuminoid, but we have body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:24.740]  Yeah.
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:42.480]  We're good.
[01:05:59.995 --> 01:06:05.820]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:07.901]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:07.901 --> 01:06:10.023]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:10.023 --> 01:06:21.692]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:21.692 --> 01:06:24.013]  But we are ready.
[01:06:24.013 --> 01:06:28.437]  I feel very confident that Joe Biden will be elected president on Tuesday.
[01:06:29.502 --> 01:06:36.783]  Whatever the end count is, but on the election that occurs on Tuesday, he will be elected.
[01:06:36.783 --> 01:06:43.625]  On January 20th, he will be inaugurated President of the United States.
[01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:47.086]  We're going to be here election night at electionnight.news.
[01:06:47.086 --> 01:06:49.506]  That's the new URL that Big Tech's having trouble censoring.
[01:06:49.506 --> 01:06:57.308]  And I'm going to be here with a raft of incredible co-hosts and surprises that you're not going to want to miss.
[01:06:57.308 --> 01:06:58.168]  Believe me, it's going to be big.
[01:06:59.076 --> 01:06:59.777]  Tuesday night.
[01:06:59.777 --> 01:07:01.077]  We'll be here Monday night in the lead-up.
[01:07:01.077 --> 01:07:02.398]  We'll be here the next day.
[01:07:02.398 --> 01:07:11.345]  I hope Trump wins in such a giant landslide that it's self-evident and they don't claim, oh, there's all these uncounted ballots and they have Democrat judges say, keep it open.
[01:07:11.345 --> 01:07:13.166]  But they're already doing that.
[01:07:13.166 --> 01:07:16.809]  And they've said they're not going to accept the results.
[01:07:16.809 --> 01:07:27.817]  And when they don't accept the results, even though it's clear Trump's going to win, if he wins, and I think he will, their activists have been primed and ready to burn down cities the Democrats control
[01:07:29.224 --> 01:07:32.647]  Because the police have been ordered to stand down like we just saw in Philadelphia.
[01:07:32.647 --> 01:07:41.294]  And all over California, Michigan, other areas, New York, they're handing out, the local cities are.
[01:07:41.294 --> 01:07:45.038]  Plywood saying, board up your businesses for what's going to happen Tuesday night.
[01:07:45.038 --> 01:07:46.959]  And all the gangs and criminals are online.
[01:07:46.959 --> 01:07:47.820]  I have articles right here.
[01:07:47.820 --> 01:07:49.962]  I've talked to law enforcement, they've confirmed it.
[01:07:50.868 --> 01:08:13.674]  That all 50 states, the gangs and criminal groups, like Devil's Night they used to have in Detroit, they kind of drove business out of Detroit, starting in the 70s and 80s, where criminals would go out and carjack, murder, rob, arson, on the same night, Halloween, so that police couldn't respond.
[01:08:13.674 --> 01:08:19.515]  And that's kind of the same globalist program, is undermine the pillars of the city, undermine society, and bring things down.
[01:08:21.638 --> 01:08:27.402]  So, I had some guests scheduled today, but I've canceled them.
[01:08:27.402 --> 01:08:33.385]  We do have a lot of other information to cover.
[01:08:33.385 --> 01:08:35.887]  Nick Begich, of course, will be co-hosting in the fourth hour.
[01:08:35.887 --> 01:08:41.170]  Robert Barnes is popping in, constitutional lawyer, to give his take on things.
[01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:45.152]  But I did cancel some guests that we're gonna be on right now, so we can take your phone calls.
[01:08:45.152 --> 01:08:47.274]  And I want to say, first-time callers here,
[01:08:48.740 --> 01:08:53.962]  I'd love to hear from you specifically on Pelosi saying, we don't care what the election results are.
[01:08:53.962 --> 01:08:56.823]  He's going to be inaugurated.
[01:08:56.823 --> 01:08:58.684]  She said that months ago.
[01:08:58.684 --> 01:09:00.104]  We played that clip.
[01:09:00.104 --> 01:09:01.145]  That's what she's saying.
[01:09:01.145 --> 01:09:03.385]  That's what she's doing.
[01:09:03.385 --> 01:09:05.366]  And what you make of all this.
[01:09:05.366 --> 01:09:17.511]  And then the intensified censorship where even the email providers, and Gmail's been caught doing this years ago, will go in and block your personal email that you're sending out to friends and family.
[01:09:18.427 --> 01:09:23.089]  Because they don't agree what's in it, and they say they do that, not off complaints from people.
[01:09:23.089 --> 01:09:27.250]  That'd be bad enough, but... because they could just block your email.
[01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:29.691]  But no.
[01:09:29.691 --> 01:09:32.472]  Off of the contents.
[01:09:32.472 --> 01:09:33.613]  They quote, scan it.
[01:09:33.613 --> 01:09:35.433]  That means they read it.
[01:09:35.433 --> 01:09:41.476]  With a computer for keywords, and then flag it for a human to look at it, and that's in the news.
[01:09:41.476 --> 01:09:44.657]  And Glenn Greenwald, you know, a gay, liberal,
[01:09:47.679 --> 01:09:54.106]  Reporter who's won a lot of awards, broken a lot of big news.
[01:09:54.106 --> 01:10:01.975]  His own editors at the thing he started, The Intercept, would not let him publish an article about Hunter Biden's... Laptop's real.
[01:10:03.018 --> 01:10:04.759]  And by the way, the FBI admits they already had it.
[01:10:04.759 --> 01:10:05.799]  They admit it's real.
[01:10:05.799 --> 01:10:08.941]  The campaign people have admitted it's real, but say it doesn't matter.
[01:10:08.941 --> 01:10:12.763]  But then they go on the news and say, oh, it's Russian disinfo, but don't show proof.
[01:10:12.763 --> 01:10:17.245]  Greenwald wrote a huge article he finally published yesterday that they wouldn't publish.
[01:10:17.245 --> 01:10:22.848]  In fact, let's play another Tucker Carlson clip here in a moment.
[01:10:22.848 --> 01:10:26.790]  Think about that.
[01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:29.592]  And they said, oh, you're just being a baby resigning.
[01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:30.352]  Oh, a baby.
[01:10:30.352 --> 01:10:31.673]  I went and read the article he wrote.
[01:10:32.844 --> 01:10:45.690]  Beautifully done, describing every aspect of how it's real, why it's real, the proof of it, the admissions, the witnesses that have come forward that have the other end of the emails, all the other iPhones that have now come out, the recordings of him.
[01:10:45.690 --> 01:10:46.790]  This is all confirmed.
[01:10:46.790 --> 01:10:50.772]  I mean, this is devastating stuff, but no one is allowed to cover it.
[01:10:50.772 --> 01:10:52.553]  Why do they not want me on Joe Rogan's show?
[01:10:52.553 --> 01:10:53.993]  Why are they boycotting that now?
[01:10:53.993 --> 01:10:57.015]  Because I talked about the laptop.
[01:10:57.015 --> 01:10:59.456]  And I talked about vaccines damaging people, which is a fact.
[01:11:02.705 --> 01:11:03.726]  It's absolutely shameful.
[01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:11.870]  So I want to take your calls on the internet kill switch they've already put in place that selectively censors conservatives and nationalists and patriots.
[01:11:11.870 --> 01:11:13.691]  And the Congress is too dumb to even figure that out.
[01:11:13.691 --> 01:11:15.792]  They're finally ready for antitrust investigations.
[01:11:15.792 --> 01:11:17.313]  They've already launched those.
[01:11:17.313 --> 01:11:19.854]  Finally they get they're being lied to, but it's beyond censorship.
[01:11:20.174 --> 01:11:34.725]  It's surveillance of everybody to censor them and big tech working in concert for foreign powers against the interest of the United States and the American people and against our very election system and the very integrity of our existence.
[01:11:34.725 --> 01:11:42.511]  And then saying those of us that want our country back and love what made us great and are loyal that we are a bad person and should be censored.
[01:11:42.511 --> 01:11:47.956]  And now a gay liberal can't do an article about how the laptop's real when it's been real since day one?
[01:11:49.301 --> 01:11:50.662]  State police have confirmed it.
[01:11:50.662 --> 01:11:52.103]  The FBI has confirmed it.
[01:11:52.103 --> 01:11:55.665]  But the left just puts out talking points they haven't.
[01:11:55.665 --> 01:11:57.146]  And some weak minds even buy into it.
[01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.567]  It's absolutely shameful.
[01:11:58.567 --> 01:12:05.311]  Here's part of Tucker Carlson talking to Mr. Greenwald.
[01:12:05.311 --> 01:12:10.414]  You live outside our country, which is one of the reasons I think you say what you think is true.
[01:12:10.414 --> 01:12:14.757]  Tell us what this portends for the future here in the United States.
[01:12:17.836 --> 01:12:32.160]  So, The Intercept was actually, for a while, a unique publication and I think the vision I just described is one reason, but another was that it was intended, above all else, to be highly skeptical of the claims of intelligence agencies.
[01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:40.403]  At the time when we were doing the reporting, the attacks were coming from the NSA, the CIA, the Deep State, against me, against my source Edward Sodin, and against the reporting.
[01:12:40.863 --> 01:12:41.384]  We're good to go.
[01:13:00.919 --> 01:13:01.059]  Okay.
[01:13:16.698 --> 01:13:24.980]  And it cited a letter from John Brennan, James Clapper, Mike Hayden, and the rest of the goons from the CIA and the intelligence community asserting it.
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:29.461]  And worse still, that letter said, we have no evidence that Russia is involved in any of this.
[01:13:29.461 --> 01:13:42.744]  The Intercept omitted that phrase, simply cited that letter to try and encourage people to ignore this evidence on the grounds that Russia had manufactured it and that the evidence was fabricated, even though there's never been any evidence that that's been true.
[01:13:43.044 --> 01:13:54.813]  Everything since has disproven it, showing Russia was not involved in any of this and nobody, certainly not even Joe Biden, disputes that these emails and other text messages are completely real and authentic.
[01:13:54.813 --> 01:13:55.714]  That's horrifying.
[01:13:55.714 --> 01:13:58.456]  So what you're watching is agencies of the U.S.
[01:13:58.456 --> 01:14:03.520]  government turning their awesome and unconstrained powers against the American population.
[01:14:06.769 --> 01:14:15.456]  This is the real story of the last four years of the Trump administration, which is that for a long time on the left, there was a healthy skepticism of the CIA.
[01:14:15.456 --> 01:14:15.977]  Yes, there was.
[01:14:15.977 --> 01:14:19.240]  There was a lot of anti-war activism in the Bush and Cheney years.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:33.552]  That has all disappeared, and the reason it's disappeared is because the CIA, from the very first days of the Trump administration, even before he was inaugurated, devoted themselves to sabotaging the administration because Donald Trump questioned just a few of their pieties, and that can't be done in Washington.
[01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:34.293]  Whoever does that
[01:14:34.753 --> 01:14:35.634]  Must be destroyed.
[01:14:35.634 --> 01:14:40.157]  And so the CIA and the deep state operatives became heroes of the liberal left.
[01:14:40.157 --> 01:14:42.699]  And again, these are rogue elements working with China.
[01:14:42.699 --> 01:14:44.160]  These are not real CIA agencies.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.201]  These are not real FBI agencies.
[01:14:45.201 --> 01:14:53.167]  These are traitors that took control of our government and are now fighting a president who's standing up for us and doing his job.
[01:14:53.167 --> 01:14:56.690]  But the good news is, it's not just Glenn Greenwald.
[01:14:56.690 --> 01:15:04.316]  All these big prominent former liberals that really meant well are now waking up to the fact that their party is a fascistic pro-communist group of criminals.
[01:15:05.489 --> 01:15:07.771]  And so whatever happens in this election, they're in a lot of trouble.
[01:15:07.771 --> 01:15:10.312]  Here's the toll-free number to join us.
[01:15:10.312 --> 01:15:13.595]  I want to get into the latest martial law lockdowns now being launched.
[01:15:13.595 --> 01:15:16.737]  Lockdown 2, they plan to monkey-see-monkey-do, bring it here.
[01:15:16.737 --> 01:15:17.437]  That's coming up.
[01:15:17.437 --> 01:15:18.638]  Your phone calls, 877-789-2539.
[01:15:18.638 --> 01:15:18.878]  877-789-Alex.
[01:15:18.878 --> 01:15:18.998]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:18.998 --> 01:15:21.900]  First-time callers, long-time callers, you agree, you disagree, we don't censor you.
[01:15:34.178 --> 01:15:39.585]  We just want to hear what you have to say and hope you have a good connection on your phone and get right to your point.
[01:15:39.585 --> 01:15:41.768]  877-789-2539.
[01:15:41.768 --> 01:15:44.011]  Your calls are coming up with a ton of news.
[01:15:44.011 --> 01:15:47.556]  And then Robert Barnes, Conscious Lawyer, joins us in the last half of the next hour.
[01:15:47.556 --> 01:15:47.977]  Stay with us.
[01:15:54.341 --> 01:16:01.328]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[01:16:01.328 --> 01:16:06.773]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[01:16:06.773 --> 01:16:09.195]  Now the media admits that almost every app
[01:16:09.355 --> 01:16:35.781]  And every company that are on Apple and on Droids, don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where you go, who you talk to, your relationships, and they all share the data with each other of what you're doing on the apps as well, including having apps turn on and listen to what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa do, and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[01:16:36.121 --> 01:16:41.346]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information.
[01:16:41.346 --> 01:16:44.469]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.
[01:16:44.469 --> 01:16:51.275]  Get your protection privacy pockets at InfoWarstore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks.
[01:16:51.275 --> 01:16:52.456]  InfoWarstore.com.
[01:16:54.468 --> 01:17:01.029]  We're only here on air facing the Globalist onslaught, the DNC-funded lawsuits, and everything that's happening because of you.
[01:17:01.029 --> 01:17:08.491]  We built the only truly multimedia, independent radio, TV, print, film organization in the world that promotes the truth against the Globalists.
[01:17:08.491 --> 01:17:09.751]  We've had a devastating effect.
[01:17:09.751 --> 01:17:10.992]  We're a national treasure.
[01:17:10.992 --> 01:17:13.292]  You're a national treasure for supporting us.
[01:17:13.292 --> 01:17:14.613]  And so, go get a t-shirt.
[01:17:14.613 --> 01:17:15.973]  Go get a historic t-shirt.
[01:17:16.753 --> 01:17:19.674]  We've got a funny one that's the Biden groping a woman.
[01:17:19.674 --> 01:17:20.995]  It's a woman's design shirt.
[01:17:20.995 --> 01:17:21.975]  My wife really likes it.
[01:17:21.975 --> 01:17:22.876]  She sent me this gift.
[01:17:22.876 --> 01:17:23.556]  It's pretty cute.
[01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:24.016]  Here it is.
[01:17:24.016 --> 01:17:25.777]  And it just, you know, it's a little historic thing.
[01:17:25.777 --> 01:17:27.117]  I think Trump's gonna win.
[01:17:27.117 --> 01:17:29.958]  But if Biden's able to steal it, we'll be probably shut down pretty quick.
[01:17:29.958 --> 01:17:31.579]  So it'll be a historic thing to have.
[01:17:31.579 --> 01:17:46.205]  You'll only be able to fight them in the third dimension on the street with graffiti, with handbills you hand out, and with noncompliance, not paying taxes, and pulling your kids out of the schools, and just making it a full-time job to expose and fight and obstruct the criminal foreign takeover of America.
[01:17:46.485 --> 01:17:47.667]  We've gotten to that point.
[01:17:47.667 --> 01:17:48.769]  Biden for nursing home.
[01:17:48.769 --> 01:17:50.993]  I hope to retire Biden and that'd be a collector's item.
[01:17:50.993 --> 01:17:52.035]  Get it while you still can.
[01:17:52.035 --> 01:17:52.936]  We're not ordering more.
[01:17:52.936 --> 01:17:57.243]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:17:57.243 --> 01:17:59.888]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:18:16.084 --> 01:18:18.946]  We live in history, folks.
[01:18:18.946 --> 01:18:20.127]  Make no mistake.
[01:18:20.127 --> 01:18:32.935]  Alright, we're going to your phone calls at 877-789-ALEX.
[01:18:32.935 --> 01:18:35.236]  But I just want to say this up front.
[01:18:35.236 --> 01:18:36.037]  History is happening now.
[01:18:42.961 --> 01:18:47.466]  This is such an amazing time to be alive, and we are grassroots, we are independent.
[01:18:47.466 --> 01:18:54.533]  InfoWars started with my idea that globalism was coming, we should prepare, we should warn people, we should build against it.
[01:18:54.533 --> 01:18:58.437]  And you've been so supportive that we put on a major defense, with your help, together.
[01:18:59.673 --> 01:19:01.054]  You did this.
[01:19:01.054 --> 01:19:06.418]  And the globalists have always sued me and tried to get documents and tried to find out what doesn't exist.
[01:19:06.418 --> 01:19:07.939]  Where's the secret money?
[01:19:07.939 --> 01:19:08.960]  Where's the secret funding?
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:09.921]  Who's behind us?
[01:19:09.921 --> 01:19:11.202]  Because they're all slaves.
[01:19:11.202 --> 01:19:13.143]  They all have masters, not us.
[01:19:13.143 --> 01:19:15.545]  We are independent.
[01:19:15.545 --> 01:19:17.646]  This is organic, like everything humans do.
[01:19:17.646 --> 01:19:21.869]  It doesn't come from some mystique-filled secret group.
[01:19:21.869 --> 01:19:26.233]  It comes from our genetics, our blood, our sweat, our tears.
[01:19:26.233 --> 01:19:27.834]  Who we are, who our ancestors are.
[01:19:30.049 --> 01:19:34.632]  And so there was almost no opposition to world government 20 years ago, 30 years ago.
[01:19:34.632 --> 01:19:36.213]  Now it's massive.
[01:19:36.213 --> 01:19:39.315]  And so the fights just started and we're winning right up front.
[01:19:39.315 --> 01:19:49.721]  We're losing as well in some areas, but Mark Twain said that a lie goes halfway around the world before truth puts his pants on.
[01:19:49.721 --> 01:19:51.182]  That's true.
[01:19:51.182 --> 01:19:58.366]  He also said the beginning of patriots, a scarce man, hated, feared, scorned, and in time when his cause succeeds, the timid join him because then it costs nothing to be a patriot.
[01:19:59.326 --> 01:20:05.010]  And that's totally true when he said it 150 years ago as it is now.
[01:20:05.010 --> 01:20:08.113]  And so you're the patriots that were here in the winter.
[01:20:08.113 --> 01:20:23.305]  You think the storm is here right now, but it's a spring storm bringing the water of liberty and justice and awakening that leads us into the summer and the golden age if we accept God's providence and God's gift.
[01:20:23.305 --> 01:20:24.926]  All right, we're going to go to Tyler D.C.
[01:20:27.682 --> 01:20:32.771]  Ian, Red Wave, Allison, Jacob, and many others.
[01:20:32.771 --> 01:20:37.359]  Let's go to Allison in Virginia on Nancy Pelosi and what she just said.
[01:20:37.359 --> 01:20:37.659]  Go ahead.
[01:20:38.902 --> 01:20:39.542]  Hi, Alex.
[01:20:39.542 --> 01:20:40.403]  This is Allison.
[01:20:40.403 --> 01:20:40.963]  Can you hear me?
[01:20:40.963 --> 01:20:41.363]  I can.
[01:20:41.363 --> 01:20:42.703]  Good to have you on the list.
[01:20:42.703 --> 01:20:43.384]  Oh, great.
[01:20:43.384 --> 01:20:43.984]  Hi.
[01:20:43.984 --> 01:20:52.527]  I was just telling you guys, I was like, you know, I'm so sorry to say that I voted for Hillary Clinton back in 2016.
[01:20:52.527 --> 01:20:58.069]  And after that, I kind of had a real awakening and started listening to you.
[01:20:58.069 --> 01:21:04.571]  And I'm actually, I had said I wasn't going to vote anymore after the last election, but this election I'm going to go down and vote for Trump.
[01:21:04.571 --> 01:21:04.831]  So,
[01:21:05.151 --> 01:21:05.852]  Well, that's beautiful.
[01:21:05.852 --> 01:21:14.918]  Well, just to be clear, I was so disillusioned with the Republicans and George W. Bush and how bad McCain was, I was neutral in the 2008 election.
[01:21:14.918 --> 01:21:17.160]  I mean, I criticized both candidates.
[01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:22.603]  But once Obama got in, he was so bad, I was like, oh my God.
[01:21:22.603 --> 01:21:25.185]  Of course, McCain wasn't really running against him.
[01:21:25.185 --> 01:21:26.106]  He was a placeholder.
[01:21:26.106 --> 01:21:28.988]  But absolutely, so don't feel bad you voted for Hillary.
[01:21:28.988 --> 01:21:30.109]  Just thank God you're awake now.
[01:21:31.115 --> 01:21:32.656]  You know, that's what I'm saying.
[01:21:32.656 --> 01:21:41.119]  You know, I think we were all fooled by Obama and we thought, you know, he was going to make all these changes and we were all just really let down.
[01:21:41.119 --> 01:21:47.481]  And I'm, you know, I'm trying to convince my dad, you know, that this Democratic Party has changed.
[01:21:47.481 --> 01:21:49.422]  It's not the same anymore.
[01:21:49.422 --> 01:21:51.202]  They're turning socialist.
[01:21:51.202 --> 01:21:54.224]  And I don't know, he still wants to vote for Biden.
[01:21:54.224 --> 01:21:57.565]  I'm like, the guy's senile, dementia-ed up.
[01:21:58.786 --> 01:22:04.130]  How do we get through to the people that don't see this?
[01:22:04.130 --> 01:22:06.531]  Alison, I hear you so much and I appreciate your call.
[01:22:06.531 --> 01:22:07.532]  God bless.
[01:22:07.532 --> 01:22:26.004]  I would just say to your dad, Dad, I understand your identity is to vote Democrat and your identity is to buy into all this, but Joe Biden is a Chinese communist agent and his son has been busted on their payroll and show him, Glenn Greenwald's reporting, a very respected liberal gay person.
[01:22:26.792 --> 01:22:33.394]  Okay, a gay man who hates right-wingers doesn't like, but he has to tell the truth.
[01:22:33.394 --> 01:22:42.578]  And he's saying that Trump's anti-war, Trump's pro-America, and Joe Biden works for the Communist Chinese, and the laptop's real.
[01:22:42.578 --> 01:22:44.179]  And the media just can't ignore that.
[01:22:44.179 --> 01:22:45.319]  And Greenwald understands that.
[01:22:45.319 --> 01:22:49.140]  The truth is going to come out.
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:51.821]  And people are on the wrong side of history here that are going against it.
[01:22:51.821 --> 01:22:53.922]  So I would just try to educate your dad that way.
[01:22:53.922 --> 01:22:55.563]  Okay, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:22:56.411 --> 01:22:58.711]  Let's go to Todd in California.
[01:22:58.711 --> 01:23:01.532]  Todd, welcome, sir.
[01:23:01.532 --> 01:23:02.472]  Hey, Alex.
[01:23:02.472 --> 01:23:03.592]  How's it going, man?
[01:23:03.592 --> 01:23:05.093]  Man, I'm just really excited.
[01:23:05.093 --> 01:23:06.493]  Only three and a half days from the election.
[01:23:06.493 --> 01:23:06.733]  Wow.
[01:23:06.733 --> 01:23:10.214]  I mean, this is an amazing time.
[01:23:10.214 --> 01:23:11.574]  It really is.
[01:23:11.574 --> 01:23:15.194]  It's really blowing me away.
[01:23:15.194 --> 01:23:23.276]  Well, basically, what my topic is, is that what I think is going to happen is the Chinese Communist Party, when the Democrats fail to secure the election,
[01:23:23.922 --> 01:23:33.791]  They're going to take all of the evidence they have, and they're going to dump as much of it as they can in order to secure some type of bargaining chip with the trade deal that they've arranged.
[01:23:33.791 --> 01:23:36.433]  Well that's right, you showed... Okay, what's your background, Todd?
[01:23:36.433 --> 01:23:39.396]  That's a very sophisticated thing you said.
[01:23:39.396 --> 01:23:41.378]  What's your background to know something like that?
[01:23:42.851 --> 01:23:47.837]  Uh, well, no, I just, I've been watching you for about six years now, and I noticed things about people.
[01:23:47.837 --> 01:23:50.801]  It really shocked people when I, that I noticed certain things.
[01:23:50.801 --> 01:23:53.824]  And I noticed little things, and you always say it right after.
[01:23:53.824 --> 01:23:55.887]  I really feel like we have that.
[01:23:55.887 --> 01:23:56.928]  Well, let's lay that out, Todd.
[01:23:56.928 --> 01:24:01.133]  What's going to happen is, this is the reason Democrats are so desperate and so dangerous and will do anything.
[01:24:01.133 --> 01:24:02.374]  If they don't win this election,
[01:24:02.995 --> 01:24:16.850]  It won't be the Justice Department releasing all this horrible stuff, it's going to be the CHICOMS, who will then try to run up to the new establishment in the United States and help destroy the opposition, hoping that will curry favor with Trump, which it's not going to do, by the way.
[01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:18.892]  But that is exactly how communists operate.
[01:24:18.892 --> 01:24:19.893]  They only respect strength.
[01:24:20.333 --> 01:24:20.893]  Absolutely, absolutely.
[01:24:20.893 --> 01:24:22.093]  It's only their asses on the line.
[01:24:40.472 --> 01:24:41.593]  Yeah, and here's the other problem.
[01:24:41.593 --> 01:24:45.017]  They never get in trouble, so why shouldn't they make another run at the country?
[01:24:45.017 --> 01:24:46.779]  Why shouldn't they try to have a race war?
[01:24:46.779 --> 01:24:49.242]  Why shouldn't they do the fake COVID lockdowns?
[01:24:49.242 --> 01:24:53.607]  Have you seen out on CNN everywhere, they're wearing masks on TV now to scare us?
[01:24:53.607 --> 01:24:54.969]  Like, oh, don't take your mask off!
[01:24:54.969 --> 01:24:56.511]  Look, I wear one on TV!
[01:24:56.511 --> 01:24:58.013]  I mean, it's ridiculous!
[01:24:59.457 --> 01:25:00.557]  Oh, they're trying to scare us.
[01:25:00.557 --> 01:25:01.458]  They really are.
[01:25:01.458 --> 01:25:02.498]  They're doing everything they can.
[01:25:02.498 --> 01:25:04.059]  They've brainwashed too many people.
[01:25:04.059 --> 01:25:11.101]  Dude, they're dressed up in Grim Reaper outfits all over the country saying, I'm COVID!
[01:25:11.101 --> 01:25:13.322]  Somebody, our old Grim Reaper outfit got torn up.
[01:25:13.322 --> 01:25:14.703]  Go get me a new Grim Reaper outfit.
[01:25:14.703 --> 01:25:16.283]  I bet they're all sold out.
[01:25:16.283 --> 01:25:17.444]  Get me a Grim Reaper outfit.
[01:25:17.444 --> 01:25:20.745]  I'm going to go around and go, I'm COVID!
[01:25:20.745 --> 01:25:23.126]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:25:23.126 --> 01:25:28.868]  If Halloween wasn't the LARPer holiday of all holidays, and it's just before the election, it's just,
[01:25:29.586 --> 01:25:32.749]  It's just their perfect day to just be as insane as they want to be.
[01:25:51.164 --> 01:25:53.566]  In Europe, in Australia, that's totally expanded.
[01:25:53.566 --> 01:25:54.646]  It's monkey see, monkey do.
[01:25:54.646 --> 01:25:57.128]  They're saying, oh, we better do what they're doing in Europe.
[01:25:57.128 --> 01:26:02.992]  That's what Governor Whitmer and Governor Wolf and Governor Cuomo and Governor Newsom and all the globalist trash are doing.
[01:26:02.992 --> 01:26:10.918]  There's video for TV viewers of the French, by the millions, trying to flee Paris ahead of a total lockdown, saying you can't even go to the store.
[01:26:10.918 --> 01:26:12.459]  See, it's the next year now.
[01:26:12.459 --> 01:26:13.520]  It's the next season.
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:15.321]  Now it's even worse martial law.
[01:26:15.321 --> 01:26:17.483]  The next martial law is forced inoculations.
[01:26:18.283 --> 01:26:19.504]  Children being taken from you.
[01:26:19.504 --> 01:26:21.145]  It's all been announced.
[01:26:21.145 --> 01:26:24.127]  People keep asking, Jones must be an intelligence operative.
[01:26:24.127 --> 01:26:25.768]  How the hell does he keep predicting?
[01:26:25.768 --> 01:26:28.390]  They tell you what they're gonna do!
[01:26:28.390 --> 01:26:29.271]  They tell you!
[01:26:29.271 --> 01:26:31.172]  They tell you!
[01:26:31.172 --> 01:26:31.953]  They tell you!
[01:26:31.953 --> 01:26:37.697]  I know way more than some idiot in an intelligence agency that just buys into propaganda and spews it.
[01:26:37.697 --> 01:26:42.781]  I'm an independent person analyzing these criminals and their behavior as a criminologist.
[01:26:42.781 --> 01:26:44.542]  An independent criminologist.
[01:26:44.542 --> 01:26:46.483]  We'll be right back with your phone calls in just a few minutes.
[01:26:46.483 --> 01:26:46.944]  Stay with us.
[01:26:52.686 --> 01:26:55.507]  I want us to sink in, and I want us to sink in real good.
[01:26:55.507 --> 01:27:03.551]  And to everybody listening, including my own brain, this lockdown is incredibly sinister and has already startled two million people to death.
[01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:06.973]  It is designed to incrementally be slowly tightened down around our necks.
[01:27:07.913 --> 01:27:11.455]  They are never going to release it.
[01:27:11.455 --> 01:27:16.579]  That's why Trump coming out and saying we cannot, quote, beat the virus by staying locked up.
[01:27:16.579 --> 01:27:18.180]  We have to get herd immunity.
[01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:20.501]  It's not as deadly as they said it's so important.
[01:27:20.501 --> 01:27:28.647]  Because this is a UN, Bill Gates, globalist deployed corporate takeover, where their businesses are all essential, but our businesses aren't.
[01:27:29.427 --> 01:27:32.669]  This is destroying the world economy by design.
[01:27:32.669 --> 01:27:34.270]  This is economic warfare.
[01:27:34.270 --> 01:27:36.372]  This is war crime.
[01:27:36.372 --> 01:27:40.054]  And now they're coming with the attempted forced inoculations that Gates is pushing.
[01:27:40.054 --> 01:27:41.335]  Well, you know what that is.
[01:27:41.335 --> 01:27:46.198]  That violates the Geneva Convention, the Nuremberg Code, and so much more.
[01:27:46.198 --> 01:27:47.538]  Please spread the words.
[01:27:47.538 --> 01:27:51.201]  Please tell folks about Bandot video and the facts that are posted there.
[01:27:52.219 --> 01:27:56.482]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed.
[01:27:56.482 --> 01:27:57.682]  And why is that?
[01:27:57.682 --> 01:28:05.467]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree-like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds.
[01:28:05.467 --> 01:28:09.970]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[01:28:09.970 --> 01:28:11.250]  They didn't know why.
[01:28:11.250 --> 01:28:16.994]  Well, with modern science we know it's one of the purest, cleanest organic forms of selenium.
[01:28:17.594 --> 01:28:29.083]  We have BioTrue Selenium, sold out for months, back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com at 50% off, store-wide free shipping, and triple patriot points.
[01:28:29.083 --> 01:28:38.611]  BioTrue Selenium at InfoWarsStore.com is an amazing product, and it's even more amazing in that it funds our operation.
[01:28:38.611 --> 01:28:41.113]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it.
[01:28:41.113 --> 01:28:43.455]  It is an essential nutrient in the body
[01:28:43.815 --> 01:28:45.199]  You absolutely have to have.
[01:28:45.199 --> 01:28:46.624]  It's back in stock.
[01:28:46.624 --> 01:28:47.125]  50% off.
[01:28:47.125 --> 01:28:50.495]  Triple Patriot points at InfoWarshaw.com and with free shipping.
[01:28:52.324 --> 01:28:58.890]  Much of the time on big issues and societal developments, InfoWars is many, many years ahead.
[01:28:58.890 --> 01:29:07.479]  And almost all the time we are tomorrow's news today, but there's a blind spot that InfoWars has, and I've noticed that really informed people have this as well.
[01:29:07.479 --> 01:29:14.205]  I know a lot of you tuning in are some of the most informable out there, so I want you to be retrospective and kind of examine yourself, because that's what I do every day.
[01:29:15.146 --> 01:29:23.981]  This Hunter Biden laptop is important, but the new audio, confirmed to be him, where he admits he works under the Communist Chinese spy chief?
[01:29:24.861 --> 01:29:26.022]  He should be arrested right now.
[01:29:26.022 --> 01:29:28.503]  That is so huge.
[01:29:28.503 --> 01:29:30.864]  That is hiding in plain view.
[01:29:30.864 --> 01:29:33.105]  And it's getting almost no attention.
[01:29:33.105 --> 01:29:35.206]  We have to get that information out to everybody.
[01:29:35.206 --> 01:29:37.447]  It's all posted on Infowars.com.
[01:29:37.447 --> 01:29:40.728]  It's on many other major patriotic sites.
[01:29:40.728 --> 01:29:44.610]  But we need to get it out to everybody and remember that we know all of this.
[01:29:44.610 --> 01:29:46.011]  We knew it a long time ago.
[01:29:46.011 --> 01:29:48.892]  So when it breaks now, we kind of go, okay, tell us something we didn't know.
[01:29:48.892 --> 01:29:50.413]  The point is, now it's documented.
[01:29:50.413 --> 01:29:51.133]  Now it's proven.
[01:29:54.750 --> 01:29:57.361]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:30:29.631 --> 01:30:49.951]  Millions of people try to flee Paris ahead of another lockdown that Macron, the dictator, has about a 19% approval rating, has implemented as they try to flee Paris to the countryside ahead of another six-month lockdown.
[01:30:51.061 --> 01:30:52.582]  Escape from Paris.
[01:30:52.582 --> 01:30:58.486]  Keith Ellison wields power to restrict freedom of assembly of political opponents at Minnesota Trump rally.
[01:30:58.486 --> 01:31:07.452]  He says Trump is not allowed to have more than 250 people because of social distancing rules in an arena that holds 25,000.
[01:31:07.452 --> 01:31:10.714]  And says police will arrest them.
[01:31:10.714 --> 01:31:12.095]  So he wants to abolish the police.
[01:31:12.095 --> 01:31:14.257]  He says police should not respond to rapes.
[01:31:14.257 --> 01:31:17.239]  That's a video because he's a well-known sex assaulter.
[01:31:19.244 --> 01:31:22.866]  But the police will be there to stop your political rallies.
[01:31:22.866 --> 01:31:31.432]  So the known communist, the known jihadi sympathizer has come out and said, it's on TV, says, you will not have your Trump rally.
[01:31:31.432 --> 01:31:32.052]  I am God.
[01:31:32.052 --> 01:31:32.672]  I am king.
[01:31:32.672 --> 01:31:34.734]  I am master.
[01:31:34.734 --> 01:31:37.635]  Black Lives Matter can riot and loot and burn and kill people.
[01:31:37.635 --> 01:31:38.216]  That's OK.
[01:31:38.216 --> 01:31:40.557]  But you don't have the president here.
[01:31:40.557 --> 01:31:41.398]  Permanent lockdown.
[01:31:43.044 --> 01:31:47.806]  Michigan orders restaurants to collect customers' information amid COVID surges.
[01:31:47.806 --> 01:31:48.866]  Same thing has happened in Europe.
[01:31:48.866 --> 01:31:50.086]  Then they have apps on the phones.
[01:31:50.086 --> 01:31:53.808]  That's why when you go in all the restaurants now, they have a QR code, no menu.
[01:31:53.808 --> 01:31:56.929]  That's getting you ready to check you and track you to be able to buy and sell.
[01:31:56.929 --> 01:31:57.269]  The U.N.
[01:31:57.269 --> 01:31:57.629]  admits it.
[01:31:57.629 --> 01:32:01.110]  This is all the rollout of the cashless society.
[01:32:01.110 --> 01:32:02.151]  U.S.
[01:32:02.151 --> 01:32:05.672]  coronaviruses cases hit record daily high.
[01:32:07.031 --> 01:32:10.734]  And experts warn daily death rates will triple by mid-January.
[01:32:10.734 --> 01:32:11.995]  I've been saying that for six months.
[01:32:11.995 --> 01:32:16.499]  Once the winter comes, they've got flu and pneumonia deaths that are always triple the regular.
[01:32:16.499 --> 01:32:22.484]  They'll just add it to that list as they did before in the last eight months and play the scam over every year, every year.
[01:32:23.857 --> 01:32:26.238]  See, no one's allowed to die of COVID.
[01:32:26.238 --> 01:32:27.039]  Everything's locked down.
[01:32:27.039 --> 01:32:29.980]  Now, if you said no one's allowed to die of flu, you'd go, that's just part of life.
[01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:31.161]  But, oh, it's new, though.
[01:32:31.161 --> 01:32:34.823]  With this new virus, oh, it's a new virus, then we can't ever go outside our houses again.
[01:32:34.823 --> 01:32:40.246]  Even though it starves to death the whole third world, collapses things, and has a depression, they think you're too dumb to remember all this.
[01:32:42.176 --> 01:32:42.636]  But the U.N.
[01:32:42.636 --> 01:32:44.436]  itself would help implement this for Bill Gates.
[01:32:44.436 --> 01:32:45.597]  They've now backed off again.
[01:32:45.597 --> 01:32:46.937]  And the head of the U.N.
[01:32:46.937 --> 01:32:49.817]  envoy for COVID says, oh, we better not lock down.
[01:32:49.817 --> 01:32:51.338]  The nation states are being bad.
[01:32:51.338 --> 01:32:52.178]  The U.N.
[01:32:52.178 --> 01:32:56.238]  will save you from the lockdown they ordered.
[01:32:56.238 --> 01:32:58.299]  Unbelievable.
[01:32:58.299 --> 01:32:58.639]  U.K.
[01:32:58.639 --> 01:33:04.440]  police chief warns lockdown could spark civil riots, unrest, of course.
[01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:11.381]  Massive traffic jam filmed in Paris as residents attempt to flee city ahead of a second lockdown by the little midget dictator.
[01:33:13.188 --> 01:33:16.409]  Oh, it doesn't matter though.
[01:33:32.932 --> 01:33:33.933]  We are at war.
[01:33:33.933 --> 01:33:45.918]  French Interior Minister says country must brace for more terror attacks fueled by Islamist ideology as mainline Muslim clerics call for killing all who are not Islamic in France and the overthrow of the government.
[01:33:45.918 --> 01:33:47.079]  State of war.
[01:33:47.079 --> 01:33:50.140]  France under siege by Islamist globalists.
[01:33:50.140 --> 01:33:51.741]  They're all working in tandem together.
[01:33:51.741 --> 01:33:56.844]  It's all at Band.Video, InfoWars.com, EuropeWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[01:33:58.877 --> 01:34:05.419]  Meanwhile, Walmart removes guns and ammunition from shelves in preparation for election unrest.
[01:34:05.419 --> 01:34:08.500]  Well, if you don't have your ammo yet, what were you thinking?
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:11.821]  Same thing for storable food.
[01:34:11.821 --> 01:34:13.582]  Crazy town it is.
[01:34:13.582 --> 01:34:20.184]  Walmart announced that it has removed guns and ammunition from store shelves in preparation for potential violent unrest following next week's presidential election.
[01:34:23.666 --> 01:34:26.167]  The other big report at InfoWars.com, I hope you share.
[01:34:26.167 --> 01:34:26.807]  Devastating.
[01:34:26.807 --> 01:34:32.628]  Giuliani confirms child porn pedophilia on Hunter Biden's laptop.
[01:34:32.628 --> 01:34:34.869]  And it just goes on from there.
[01:34:34.869 --> 01:34:43.811]  Businesses are boarding up windows and pulling guns off the shelves in anticipation of widespread election unrest.
[01:34:43.811 --> 01:34:45.952]  Lil Wayne endorses Trump for re-election.
[01:34:45.952 --> 01:34:49.012]  Let the spew hate at him.
[01:34:49.012 --> 01:34:51.133]  But it's okay, because CNN's Don Lemon
[01:34:52.964 --> 01:34:54.685]  Where's his mask now on TV?
[01:34:54.685 --> 01:34:59.449]  It's like, you know, things are so dangerous now, I'm gonna wear it on TV.
[01:34:59.449 --> 01:35:05.494]  But what did Governor Wolf get told when he was about to not wear his mask a few weeks ago in Pennsylvania?
[01:35:05.494 --> 01:35:08.296]  They said, sir, we wear it to scare them.
[01:35:08.296 --> 01:35:09.917]  It's theater.
[01:35:09.917 --> 01:35:12.700]  So I guess when you're by yourself on a mountaintop now, you better wear one.
[01:35:12.700 --> 01:35:16.563]  I mean, this is just, these people are sick trying to scare you and your family.
[01:35:16.563 --> 01:35:18.084]  Let's go ahead and roll the audio of the hot mic.
[01:35:23.153 --> 01:35:27.036]  So, Wendy, I'm going to take my mask off.
[01:35:27.036 --> 01:35:27.977]  I will as well.
[01:35:27.977 --> 01:35:34.163]  I'm waiting so that we can do a little political theater.
[01:35:34.163 --> 01:35:38.407]  So that it's on camera.
[01:35:38.407 --> 01:35:39.248]  Political theater.
[01:35:39.248 --> 01:35:40.029]  Wear it on camera.
[01:35:41.098 --> 01:35:52.686]  So now, remember in Wisconsin, the Democratic Party ordered its employees, in Democrat Party Zooms, when you're by yourself in an apartment, talking to volunteers to wear your mask.
[01:35:52.686 --> 01:35:54.086]  Because you've got to wear it at all times.
[01:35:54.086 --> 01:35:58.950]  You've got to, it's scary, you've got to see it, you've got to stay locked down, you've got to bankrupt America.
[01:35:58.950 --> 01:36:00.531]  Not just for the Chi-Coms, but the big banks.
[01:36:00.531 --> 01:36:06.855]  And again, that's what Don Lemon does now, and that's what they're all suddenly doing.
[01:36:06.855 --> 01:36:08.416]  Again, I saw Weather Channel reporters
[01:36:09.246 --> 01:36:12.028]  Wearing them on TV in the middle of a field.
[01:36:12.028 --> 01:36:13.390]  This is madness.
[01:36:13.390 --> 01:36:17.914]  But the average follower sees that and thinks, my God, this must be deadly.
[01:36:17.914 --> 01:36:21.337]  Even though it's all exaggerated lies.
[01:36:21.337 --> 01:36:24.199]  They've gotten the average person so scared that's wearing a mask.
[01:36:24.199 --> 01:36:28.103]  If you say something to them like, hey, it's not that deadly, shut up, I'm scared, don't do it.
[01:36:29.144 --> 01:36:32.228]  I've actually talked to people before, I'm like, hey, everything's okay.
[01:36:32.228 --> 01:36:34.731]  Statistically, it's very, very rare.
[01:36:34.731 --> 01:36:36.232]  They're adding regular deaths onto it.
[01:36:36.232 --> 01:36:36.433]  No!
[01:36:36.433 --> 01:36:36.913]  No!
[01:36:36.913 --> 01:36:37.654]  They start touching it!
[01:36:37.654 --> 01:36:38.655]  No!
[01:36:38.655 --> 01:36:39.356]  Mine!
[01:36:39.356 --> 01:36:39.756]  Mine!
[01:36:39.756 --> 01:36:42.900]  And a woman goes... And was just like patting the mask.
[01:36:42.900 --> 01:36:43.481]  Oh!
[01:36:43.481 --> 01:36:43.801]  Mine!
[01:36:43.801 --> 01:36:44.222]  Mine!
[01:36:46.630 --> 01:36:53.392]  Because, see, for the average, really poor person, or somebody that doesn't want to be uprightly mobile, something like this they like.
[01:36:53.392 --> 01:36:55.352]  Like, oh, I can wear this and I get something.
[01:36:55.352 --> 01:36:56.433]  It's valuable.
[01:36:56.433 --> 01:36:58.853]  Because it's free and it's empty.
[01:36:58.853 --> 01:37:00.014]  It's like a lottery ticket.
[01:37:00.014 --> 01:37:02.934]  You have almost no chance of winning, but you get it and you feel good each time.
[01:37:02.934 --> 01:37:04.275]  You don't care you're being scammed.
[01:37:04.275 --> 01:37:05.215]  You don't care you're being conned.
[01:37:05.215 --> 01:37:08.136]  You just want to be conned over and over again.
[01:37:08.136 --> 01:37:10.617]  I don't get it.
[01:37:10.617 --> 01:37:11.717]  All right.
[01:37:11.717 --> 01:37:14.438]  I've done some ranting in this segment.
[01:37:14.438 --> 01:37:15.618]  I'm going to play a clip of Joe Biden.
[01:37:16.772 --> 01:37:23.275]  Talking about how his son's the smartest person he knows, and then a clip of what Joe Biden actually, Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, is actually up to.
[01:37:23.275 --> 01:37:26.337]  I'm going to go to break, come back with your calls, but here it is.
[01:37:26.337 --> 01:37:29.358]  And I had my son, Hunter, is the smartest guy I know.
[01:37:29.358 --> 01:37:45.526]  I get calls from my father to tell me that the New York Times is calling, but my old partner, Eric, who literally has done me harm for I don't know how long, is the one taking the calls because my father will not stop sending the calls to Eric.
[01:37:46.803 --> 01:38:09.748]  I have another New York Times reporter calling about my representation of the, literally, Dr. Patrick Coe, the f***ing spy chief of China, who started the company that my partner, who was worth $323 billion, founded.
[01:38:09.748 --> 01:38:10.968]  It is now missing.
[01:38:10.968 --> 01:38:14.709]  The richest man in the world is missing, who was my partner.
[01:38:16.237 --> 01:38:29.646]  He was missing since I last saw him in his $58 million apartment and signed a $4 billion deal to build the f***ing largest f***ing LNG port in the world!
[01:38:29.646 --> 01:38:35.370]  And... I am receiving calls from the U.S.
[01:38:35.370 --> 01:38:36.550]  Attorney himself.
[01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:44.275]  My best friend in business, Devin, has named me as a witness without telling me.
[01:38:44.275 --> 01:38:45.116]  In a criminal case,
[01:38:45.993 --> 01:38:47.915]  And my father, without telling me.
[01:38:47.915 --> 01:38:50.877]  And my father.
[01:38:50.877 --> 01:38:53.920]  What a little whiny scumbag.
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:56.883]  And I had my son, Hunter is the smartest guy I know.
[01:38:58.925 --> 01:39:18.442]  My son, Hunter, the smartest guy I know, and he can't even keep his act together because you're all a bunch of losers that stole the country, your predecessors stole it, used TV to fandango us and manipulate us and cattywampus us and mesmerize us and run your scams.
[01:39:18.442 --> 01:39:22.365]  And now that we're awake, you're really pissed, crapping your britches, aren't you, buddy boy?
[01:39:22.365 --> 01:39:24.367]  Oh, what happened to the head of Chinese intelligence?
[01:39:24.367 --> 01:39:25.308]  I already disappeared too.
[01:39:26.766 --> 01:39:29.988]  What, you think you're gonna hand over all our secrets to them?
[01:39:29.988 --> 01:39:32.650]  We're not gonna punch back, you little rat bastard?
[01:39:32.650 --> 01:39:37.072]  You haven't been given one-tenth of what's about to happen to you and your disgusting, filthy family.
[01:39:37.072 --> 01:39:44.577]  You're lucky Tucker Carlson hopes you're treated leniently, because I'm not the same type of person, you little scumbag rat.
[01:39:44.577 --> 01:39:48.980]  Oh, nothing happens to any little hair on your chinny-chin-chin before you get convicted.
[01:39:52.708 --> 01:39:54.330]  China is open.
[01:39:54.330 --> 01:39:56.172]  America is closed.
[01:39:56.172 --> 01:40:04.162]  And in the European Union, where the people are revolting trying to get out of the authoritarian tyranny, they're also under even greater levels of lockdown.
[01:40:04.162 --> 01:40:05.384]  It's very simple.
[01:40:05.384 --> 01:40:08.527]  Where authoritarians already have complete control, like Communist China,
[01:40:09.308 --> 01:40:12.089]  Oh, there's no more lockdowns, and they're heroes, and the U.N.
[01:40:12.089 --> 01:40:14.869]  says they're the example for us all.
[01:40:14.869 --> 01:40:16.950]  After all, that's where the virus came from.
[01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:19.350]  After all, that's where the fear-mongering came from.
[01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:20.551]  That's where the lockdown came from.
[01:40:20.551 --> 01:40:35.314]  But that was a weapon, a psychological hysteria, a chicken little syndrome being created that was to then be aimed at us and used to invoke our fear and have us go into a stampede of mass hysteria.
[01:40:36.474 --> 01:40:40.078]  And so far, it's been incredibly successful.
[01:40:40.078 --> 01:40:49.428]  Until just the last few weeks, as across the world, humanity awakens to the fact that COVID-19 is a giant UN Communist Chinese World Government power grab.
[01:40:51.383 --> 01:40:54.746]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[01:40:54.746 --> 01:40:56.728]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[01:40:56.728 --> 01:40:58.069]  Is your city too safe?
[01:40:58.069 --> 01:41:02.213]  Well, not anymore!
[01:41:02.213 --> 01:41:04.615]  Introducing... Democrats!
[01:41:04.615 --> 01:41:08.838]  Politicians so incompetent, they'll fill your neighborhood with riots!
[01:41:08.838 --> 01:41:09.199]  Looting!
[01:41:10.311 --> 01:41:13.532]  Rampant violence and even homelessness.
[01:41:13.532 --> 01:41:18.554]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old-fashioned stupidity.
[01:41:18.554 --> 01:41:20.955]  No more pesky law and order.
[01:41:20.955 --> 01:41:24.696]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[01:41:24.696 --> 01:41:29.198]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back, and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[01:41:29.998 --> 01:41:30.960]  But wait!
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:39.816]  Vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes, and more taxes!
[01:41:39.816 --> 01:41:42.881]  Democrats, bringing chaos right to your front door!
[01:41:52.478 --> 01:41:56.940]  Two InfoWars best-selling products are now back in stock for being sold out for months.
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:42:03.102]  BioTrue Selenium from the mustard seed, essential in all electrochemical activity in the cells in the body.

[01:42:50.858 --> 01:42:51.779]  InfoWareStore.com.

[01:43:10.942 --> 01:43:14.203]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.

[01:43:17.766 --> 01:43:20.007]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[01:43:20.007 --> 01:43:21.408]  I suggest Band.Video.
[01:43:22.088 --> 01:43:27.551]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[01:43:27.551 --> 01:43:36.014]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[01:43:36.014 --> 01:43:42.738]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[01:43:42.738 --> 01:43:45.539]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[01:43:55.826 --> 01:43:58.445]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:44:26.331 --> 01:44:33.297]  Well, Trump's swinging through those battleground states, and he's set to go to Minnesota tomorrow.
[01:44:33.297 --> 01:44:39.362]  But the Attorney General admitted communist, and Jihadi sympathizer says, you're not welcome.
[01:44:39.362 --> 01:44:41.144]  We're going to use COVID to stop you being here.
[01:44:41.144 --> 01:44:46.529]  When the federal courts and the state have ruled, you can't block gatherings and violate the First Amendment in the name of your damn COVID hype.
[01:44:46.529 --> 01:44:49.071]  And on top of the Democrats use COVID.
[01:44:50.916 --> 01:44:53.838]  For a selective lockdown only against their enemies.
[01:44:53.838 --> 01:44:54.479]  It's incredible.
[01:44:54.479 --> 01:44:56.781]  Here's what President Trump just had to say about it.
[01:44:56.781 --> 01:45:00.163]  I only ran because of Biden and Obama.
[01:45:00.163 --> 01:45:02.145]  If they did a good job, I wouldn't have run.
[01:45:02.145 --> 01:45:06.068]  And I guess I wouldn't have won either, but I wouldn't have run.
[01:45:06.068 --> 01:45:08.170]  They did a lousy job.
[01:45:08.170 --> 01:45:09.191]  I watched them now.
[01:45:09.191 --> 01:45:10.131]  I'm going to do this.
[01:45:10.131 --> 01:45:11.392]  I'm going to do that.
[01:45:11.392 --> 01:45:13.254]  Why the hell didn't he do it?
[01:45:13.254 --> 01:45:14.074]  Why didn't he do it?
[01:45:15.115 --> 01:45:20.879]  Sleepy Joe, and that was when he was a little bit, a little bit better, a little bit more awake.
[01:45:20.879 --> 01:45:23.561]  He's going to do what he hasn't done in 47 years.
[01:45:23.561 --> 01:45:24.201]  I'm going to do it.
[01:45:24.201 --> 01:45:27.323]  That was so easy, that debate, because it hit me.
[01:45:27.323 --> 01:45:28.524]  I am going to do this.
[01:45:28.524 --> 01:45:30.806]  And I just kept saying, Joe, why didn't you do it?
[01:45:30.806 --> 01:45:33.427]  You know, and it was three and a half years ago.
[01:45:33.427 --> 01:45:34.608]  It wasn't like a long time.
[01:45:34.608 --> 01:45:36.069]  It was three and a half years ago.
[01:45:36.069 --> 01:45:40.052]  Biden has vowed to abolish the entire U.S.
[01:45:40.052 --> 01:45:41.673]  energy industry.
[01:45:41.673 --> 01:45:42.333]  Right.
[01:45:42.333 --> 01:45:42.934]  No fracking.
[01:45:44.062 --> 01:45:45.602]  Guy went for a year and a half.
[01:45:45.602 --> 01:45:47.443]  No fracking, no fracking, no fracking.
[01:45:47.443 --> 01:45:48.583]  Then he goes to Pennsylvania.
[01:45:48.583 --> 01:45:50.824]  Of course we're going to frack.
[01:45:50.824 --> 01:45:53.825]  And the press, the fake news never asks about it.
[01:45:53.825 --> 01:45:54.565]  No energy.
[01:45:54.565 --> 01:45:57.826]  And you're going to have gas prices.
[01:45:57.826 --> 01:46:00.746]  This is not great for selling your beautiful cars.
[01:46:00.746 --> 01:46:03.907]  Gas prices of $6 and $7.
[01:46:03.907 --> 01:46:06.708]  Right now, it's nice to be under $2, isn't it?
[01:46:06.708 --> 01:46:09.209]  You never thought you'd see that.
[01:46:09.209 --> 01:46:10.589]  You never thought you'd see that.
[01:46:11.658 --> 01:46:14.920]  Biden's running mate, America's most liberal senator.
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:19.202]  She makes Bernie look like a conservative.
[01:46:19.202 --> 01:46:23.165]  Crazy Bernie is like a conservative compared to her.
[01:46:23.165 --> 01:46:26.266]  She even... Kamala.
[01:46:26.266 --> 01:46:30.028]  You have to pronounce it exactly right, otherwise she gets very upset.
[01:46:30.028 --> 01:46:31.629]  Even though she can't pronounce it right.
[01:46:31.629 --> 01:46:32.550]  You saw that the other...
[01:46:36.681 --> 01:46:40.362]  I think that was actually, that was on the great Laura Ingraham Show.
[01:46:40.362 --> 01:46:42.142]  Actually, I watched that.
[01:46:42.142 --> 01:46:45.383]  And I do believe Laura Ingraham is here someplace.
[01:46:45.383 --> 01:46:48.444]  That's Waterford Township, Michigan.
[01:46:48.444 --> 01:46:50.865]  Trump is in Fuego, as usual.
[01:46:50.865 --> 01:46:57.226]  I'm going to go to your phone calls now for Red Wave and many others that are patiently holding.
[01:46:57.226 --> 01:47:01.847]  But remember, these globalists are working around the clock to shut us down.
[01:47:01.847 --> 01:47:04.248]  Trump's raised about half the money the Democrats have.
[01:47:05.913 --> 01:47:08.456]  They're outspending in 5-1 in battleground states.
[01:47:08.456 --> 01:47:09.657]  But we have people power.
[01:47:09.657 --> 01:47:11.439]  Even though they're censorious and more.
[01:47:11.439 --> 01:47:12.580]  Your power to spread the word.
[01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:13.702]  Your power to share articles.
[01:47:13.702 --> 01:47:15.424]  Your power to share videos.
[01:47:15.424 --> 01:47:17.045]  Our power to do that.
[01:47:17.045 --> 01:47:19.268]  And yes, your power to go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:47:19.268 --> 01:47:21.150]  Plus, these are things you really need.
[01:47:21.150 --> 01:47:24.434]  I couldn't operate without X2 and X3 that are essential to my body.
[01:47:24.434 --> 01:47:25.295]  Good, clean iodine.
[01:47:26.553 --> 01:47:30.734]  I couldn't operate without BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula when I get aches and pains.
[01:47:30.734 --> 01:47:33.355]  It works so much better than even things like Advil.
[01:47:33.355 --> 01:47:34.396]  So many listeners have said that.
[01:47:34.396 --> 01:47:36.256]  Thousands of five-star reviews.
[01:47:36.256 --> 01:47:39.257]  And BODY's Ultimate Turmeric Formula is back in stock.
[01:47:39.257 --> 01:47:40.858]  It's been sold out for months.
[01:47:40.858 --> 01:47:41.878]  50% off.
[01:47:41.878 --> 01:47:42.818]  Triple paid for in points.

[01:47:45.407 --> 01:47:45.807]  Thank you.
[01:48:07.185 --> 01:48:09.208]  Almost 100% reviews on Biosilicium.
[01:48:09.208 --> 01:48:10.129]  It's incredible.
[01:48:10.129 --> 01:48:11.211]  It's back in stock.
[01:48:11.211 --> 01:48:13.354]  And those will be next week's specials.
[01:48:13.354 --> 01:48:18.040]  They'll be the special for a few weeks because that's the big product we've got in stock that's high quality.
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:22.045]  The other big sale is going to have to end on Sunday because this stuff's all selling out.
[01:48:23.015 --> 01:48:25.796]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, free shipping, 25% off.

[01:48:36.841 --> 01:48:40.823]  All SRL products, 60% off.

[01:48:43.504 --> 01:48:45.325]  Purple Patriot Points, free shipping.
[01:48:45.325 --> 01:48:46.286]  That will end.
[01:48:47.239 --> 01:48:56.687]  On Sunday, I'm going to be up here in a big meeting Sunday, looking at what products we have, what's left, but we're going to have to end that major sale on Sunday.
[01:48:56.687 --> 01:49:03.713]  And then we will have the bodies and the selenium as the thing that hopefully keeps us afloat, because it's something you need.
[01:49:03.713 --> 01:49:04.955]  It's amazing.
[01:49:04.955 --> 01:49:06.456]  This morning, I'm like, man, I'm tired.
[01:49:06.456 --> 01:49:06.896]  I'm exhausted.
[01:49:06.896 --> 01:49:08.017]  I'm like, let me take some selenium.
[01:49:08.017 --> 01:49:10.639]  Let me take some DNA force, my iodine, take some fish oil.
[01:49:10.639 --> 01:49:10.940]  Boom.
[01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:11.640]  Felt great in 30 minutes.
[01:49:12.619 --> 01:49:16.120]  Because I was up late last night working and just, I can't help but be upset about the election and worried.
[01:49:16.120 --> 01:49:17.660]  I know you are too.
[01:49:17.660 --> 01:49:19.120]  But without these products, I couldn't do it.
[01:49:19.120 --> 01:49:20.241]  Are there other great products out there?
[01:49:20.241 --> 01:49:20.821]  Yeah.
[01:49:20.821 --> 01:49:22.341]  We go out and clone the best products.
[01:49:22.341 --> 01:49:23.521]  We're making them even better.
[01:49:23.521 --> 01:49:24.642]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:49:24.642 --> 01:49:28.662]  You know when you do that, you're getting the best quality at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:49:28.662 --> 01:49:37.464]  The biggest thing I'd be doing for yourself and your family is Vitamin Mineral Fusion with all the vitamins and minerals that are essential and amino acids for your body's natural defenses and your immune system.
[01:49:37.464 --> 01:49:40.225]  That and Ultra 12 at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:49:40.225 --> 01:49:40.465]  Okay.
[01:49:41.937 --> 01:49:44.200]  Who's been home the longest now?
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:46.504]  That would be Red Wave in California.
[01:49:46.504 --> 01:49:48.647]  Boy, we're praying for that Red Wave.
[01:49:48.647 --> 01:49:50.169]  Brother, go ahead.
[01:49:50.169 --> 01:49:51.111]  Yes, sir.
[01:49:51.111 --> 01:49:52.613]  Brother Alex, God bless you, man.
[01:49:53.474 --> 01:49:54.735]  Uh, two things.
[01:49:54.735 --> 01:50:01.782]  We're, uh, well, first and foremost, gonna, X2's awesome, gonna order some body ease later today since it's 50% off.
[01:50:01.782 --> 01:50:02.502]  Thank you.
[01:50:02.502 --> 01:50:09.388]  Um, but, uh, you know, we're gonna be stuck with the lying media, so what are we gonna do about that?
[01:50:09.388 --> 01:50:15.514]  I have, I've been trying to think of answers and I can't think of nothing.
[01:50:15.514 --> 01:50:17.575]  Say that again.
[01:50:17.575 --> 01:50:19.137]  Yeah, I'm gonna be,
[01:50:19.844 --> 01:50:23.587]  We're going to be stuck with the lying media, so what are we going to do about it?
[01:50:23.587 --> 01:50:28.211]  I've been trying to think about it, and I don't have any answers.
[01:50:28.211 --> 01:50:33.955]  Well, that's what I thought you said, and that's the thing that I spend all my time on.
[01:50:33.955 --> 01:50:42.202]  If humans get excited about the independent media, and share it, and tell others to share it, and it causes the domino chain reaction, it's game over.
[01:50:42.202 --> 01:50:44.684]  And you guys have done that a lot with InfoWars, so I'm not bitching at you.
[01:50:44.684 --> 01:50:45.505]  You're amazing.
[01:50:45.505 --> 01:50:47.647]  We wouldn't be here, none of us, without you.
[01:50:47.647 --> 01:50:48.387]  We're all in this together.
[01:50:49.588 --> 01:50:58.374]  That's why they're censoring even into people's emails now, and text messages, and CNN's calling for, you know, trying to censor phone calls with AI now.
[01:50:58.374 --> 01:51:07.040]  And that's why they say your TV's watching you, is they really want this intimidation force, where if you're not a good globalist, they take your bank account, they don't let you buy or sell.
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:10.942]  That's the Chinese communist social score that big tech actually built for them.
[01:51:10.942 --> 01:51:12.744]  So that's why this is so dangerous.
[01:51:12.744 --> 01:51:14.925]  And a lot of people say, well, I'll just serve the leftist agenda.
[01:51:14.925 --> 01:51:15.545]  I'll be fine.
[01:51:15.545 --> 01:51:16.486]  No, no, no.
[01:51:16.486 --> 01:51:19.168]  Once they get full control, you're going to have to agree to be sterilized.
[01:51:19.628 --> 01:51:22.791]  You're gonna have to agree to a termination date where you're gonna be euthanized.
[01:51:22.791 --> 01:51:25.253]  You're gonna have to agree to turn your kids over to these people.
[01:51:25.253 --> 01:51:27.535]  I mean, this is a cult of power.
[01:51:27.535 --> 01:51:32.399]  And by successive approximation, incrementalism, they believe they can get anything they want done.
[01:51:32.399 --> 01:51:34.881]  So, where they're taking us is hell.
[01:51:34.881 --> 01:51:36.742]  We need to turn off this road.
[01:51:36.742 --> 01:51:41.966]  Within a year under their system, highway checkpoints, gotta have special apps to travel state to state.
[01:51:41.966 --> 01:51:43.307]  Already started in Michigan.
[01:51:43.307 --> 01:51:45.169]  Already started in New York.
[01:51:45.169 --> 01:51:45.869]  I mean, these people...
[01:51:46.830 --> 01:51:47.291]  We're good to go.
[01:52:07.133 --> 01:52:09.494]  So I think the question is, I don't know, what are we going to do, brother?
[01:52:09.494 --> 01:52:11.115]  I've tried to build an independent organization.
[01:52:11.115 --> 01:52:12.316]  You've supported it.
[01:52:12.316 --> 01:52:14.117]  So you asked what you're going to do.
[01:52:14.117 --> 01:52:14.617]  You've done it.
[01:52:14.617 --> 01:52:18.179]  I mean, I think now you tell folks about InfoWars, brother.
[01:52:18.179 --> 01:52:19.980]  Brother, here's the other thing.
[01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:21.381]  I want to do my part.
[01:52:21.381 --> 01:52:31.327]  And I got an exclusive story for you with a video shot in a polling station that has voter suppression, election meddling, and lost ballots.
[01:52:31.327 --> 01:52:32.067]  All on video.
[01:52:32.067 --> 01:52:35.489]  I got identity, everybody, a whole transcription, a whole package.
[01:52:35.489 --> 01:52:36.470]  I need to get it to you guys.
[01:52:37.546 --> 01:52:39.588]  It needs to come out before the election.
[01:52:39.588 --> 01:52:40.528]  It's imperative.
[01:52:40.528 --> 01:52:41.669]  What do I do, sir?
[01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:43.350]  Okay, I'm gonna get your name right now.
[01:52:43.350 --> 01:52:45.312]  I got your name.
[01:52:45.312 --> 01:52:55.980]  It's Redway, but I'm gonna get your real name or your phone number, and I'll have the crew call you, and we'll do something with it, but I'll also hand you over to James O'Keefe, who knocks it out of the park.
[01:52:55.980 --> 01:52:59.723]  Have you tried to give it to Project Veritas?
[01:52:59.723 --> 01:53:05.227]  Yeah, they already approved it and everything, but they got so much going on in their news cycle that
[01:53:06.089 --> 01:53:10.772]  You know, my story's great, but all their stuff is bombshell.
[01:53:10.772 --> 01:53:16.275]  So, I've been dealing with... I can give your guys' names.
[01:53:16.275 --> 01:53:19.136]  I can give the name of the guy I've been dealing with.
[01:53:19.136 --> 01:53:25.380]  He just says his production staff, there's no place for it right now because all their stories are just bombshell.
[01:53:25.380 --> 01:53:25.880]  No, I understand.
[01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:26.840]  They're overwhelmed.
[01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:27.441]  We're the same way.
[01:53:27.441 --> 01:53:28.741]  That's what I'm trying to like.
[01:53:28.741 --> 01:53:29.722]  I'm glad Veritas is there.
[01:53:29.722 --> 01:53:33.204]  Okay, give us your info and I'll have Rob Duke or one of the crew give you a call, okay?
[01:53:33.948 --> 01:53:34.428]  Yes, sir.
[01:53:34.428 --> 01:53:34.908]  Please, sir.
[01:53:34.908 --> 01:53:35.609]  God bless.
[01:53:35.609 --> 01:53:38.150]  God bless America and MAGA 2020.
[01:53:38.150 --> 01:53:38.910]  Thank you, sir.
[01:53:38.910 --> 01:53:42.112]  All we need you to do is give us a rundown.
[01:53:42.112 --> 01:53:42.952]  This is where I was.
[01:53:42.952 --> 01:53:43.692]  This is what happened.
[01:53:43.692 --> 01:53:45.313]  This is who's doing this.
[01:53:45.313 --> 01:53:48.575]  And then there's the vetting of it, and that takes time.
[01:53:48.575 --> 01:53:49.635]  And so I'm not complaining.
[01:53:49.635 --> 01:53:51.036]  I mean, imagine what it's like, folks.
[01:53:51.036 --> 01:53:53.157]  We just... You have Hunter Biden's laptop.
[01:53:53.968 --> 01:53:55.529]  There's like 40,000 things on it.
[01:53:55.529 --> 01:53:59.313]  It's estimated 25,000 images and videos of porn.
[01:53:59.313 --> 01:54:02.956]  And it's a lot of him in bed with like really small girls.
[01:54:02.956 --> 01:54:04.597]  It looks like 10 year olds.
[01:54:04.597 --> 01:54:05.618]  I've talked to folks that have seen it.
[01:54:06.977 --> 01:54:12.538]  Man, you know, I've had it right in front of me, and I just can't look at it.
[01:54:12.538 --> 01:54:15.199]  Everybody's like, Jones, it's your job.
[01:54:15.199 --> 01:54:16.779]  You need to expose this.
[01:54:16.779 --> 01:54:18.319]  The government's got it.
[01:54:18.319 --> 01:54:21.320]  It's like Giuliani tells reporters, come to my office, you can look at this.
[01:54:21.320 --> 01:54:23.500]  Because just transmitting it is illegal.
[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:24.620]  He's like, well, send it to me.
[01:54:24.620 --> 01:54:26.841]  He's like, I'm not sending you, child porn lady.
[01:54:26.841 --> 01:54:27.481]  You're a journalist.
[01:54:27.481 --> 01:54:28.001]  I'm a journalist.
[01:54:28.001 --> 01:54:29.141]  Come look at it.
[01:54:29.141 --> 01:54:31.121]  I refuse to even look at it.
[01:54:31.121 --> 01:54:33.542]  At a certain point, there's certain things I'm not doing, OK?
[01:54:34.946 --> 01:54:38.109]  Not looking at Hunter Biden sticking his, you know what, ten-year-olds.
[01:54:38.109 --> 01:54:41.271]  I'm just not doing it.
[01:54:41.271 --> 01:54:45.675]  It's on record, it's not disputed, it was rolled out more than eight months ago in Commons, China.
[01:54:45.675 --> 01:54:50.959]  Now it's in Europe, now it's the United States, Canada, and in most other industrial parts of the planet.
[01:54:50.959 --> 01:54:57.644]  Every restaurant you go into, even small mom and pops, have QR codes for you to supposedly check their menu.
[01:54:57.644 --> 01:55:01.367]  And they really get upset if you ask for a paper menu, but of course they have them.
[01:55:02.148 --> 01:55:03.189]  Now, what are they saying there?
[01:55:03.189 --> 01:55:11.274]  Well, you've got to have a cell phone to come in their establishment, and that you can't have a piece of paper because, oh, everybody's diseased and, you know, we're spreading germs.
[01:55:11.274 --> 01:55:13.095]  It's absolutely asinine.
[01:55:13.095 --> 01:55:16.577]  They can throw away the little one-sheet papers if they actually believe that.
[01:55:16.577 --> 01:55:19.739]  No, what this really is, is a contact tracing database.
[01:55:19.739 --> 01:55:24.242]  Again, this is admitted that everyone's being habituated into scamming to be part of.
[01:55:24.242 --> 01:55:26.944]  So in the future, everywhere you go is tracked officially.
[01:55:27.424 --> 01:55:30.486]  I once saw a bumper sticker that read, if you want your children to listen to you, whisper.
[01:55:30.486 --> 01:55:31.346]  And it's true.
[01:55:31.346 --> 01:55:33.087]  A lot of times if somebody's shouting and yelling,
[01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:12.177]  And I've been pretty obnoxious over the years because I'm worried about the New World Order and I read about all their plans to lock down civilization, starve the third world, and then enslave the first world.
[01:56:12.177 --> 01:56:22.445]  So I've been really, really loud and really, really aggressive and we've had a big effect, but now it's time to think about every different angle and every different way we can get people to think
[01:56:45.227 --> 01:56:48.448]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:56:48.448 --> 01:57:00.033]  We are continuing on this live Friday transmission, taking your phone calls.
[01:57:07.952 --> 01:57:17.256]  The suspense is intense, but really, I almost feel punch-drunk from the fight that, wow, we're almost into election day.
[01:57:17.256 --> 01:57:20.697]  Saturday, Sunday, Monday, three days, so it's three and a half days.
[01:57:20.697 --> 01:57:27.520]  The rest of Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and then it is on, on, on.
[01:57:27.520 --> 01:57:35.704]  Speaking of on, we're going to go late into the night on Monday night, and then we're going to be live right through the evening on Tuesday.
[01:57:37.190 --> 01:57:42.133]  I hope Trump has such a landslide that they capitulate.
[01:57:42.133 --> 01:57:44.734]  But Pelosi has said, Biden will be president.
[01:57:44.734 --> 01:57:46.495]  Trump will be fumigated out.
[01:57:46.495 --> 01:57:48.856]  No matter what, we don't care what the election says.
[01:57:48.856 --> 01:57:51.798]  We're putting him in.
[01:57:51.798 --> 01:57:53.679]  And they've broken down the plan of how they're going to do that.
[01:57:53.679 --> 01:57:57.261]  They're just going to contest it and say, we say you didn't count these other ballots that we sent out everywhere.
[01:57:57.261 --> 01:57:57.721]  We're going to do it.
[01:57:59.531 --> 01:58:04.654]  And after she got caught going around without a mask and going to get her hair done and everything, now she wears a mask while she gives speeches.
[01:58:04.654 --> 01:58:12.698]  I mean, this is just a cult of crazies who had to use the scare of an exaggerated virus to get martial law in place.
[01:58:12.698 --> 01:58:18.701]  And now all these unpopular dictators, like Merkel and Macron, they've all become dictators of the parliamentary system.
[01:58:18.701 --> 01:58:24.503]  Once they get in, like Hitler got elected, but once he got in, he used it to basically create the elections as fraud.
[01:58:24.503 --> 01:58:26.865]  So all these dictators worldwide are doing this.
[01:58:26.865 --> 01:58:27.485]  It's disgusting.
[01:58:28.925 --> 01:58:32.967]  Jacob in South Carolina, you're on the air, thanks for holding.
[01:58:32.967 --> 01:58:34.028]  Hey, sir, can you hear me?
[01:58:34.028 --> 01:58:35.448]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:35.448 --> 01:58:43.212]  Hey, former infantry marine and former law enforcement officer, and I just want to give my opinion on what Nancy Pelosi said.
[01:58:43.212 --> 01:58:43.633]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:43.633 --> 01:58:44.153]  God bless you.
[01:58:44.153 --> 01:58:47.154]  Please give us your view and thank you for your service to the Republic.
[01:58:47.154 --> 01:58:48.975]  Yes, sir.
[01:58:48.975 --> 01:58:52.737]  Yeah, I mean, I'm beyond angry.
[01:58:52.737 --> 01:58:57.059]  And what she's saying, at the very least, is seditious and it's enticing a civil war.
[01:58:59.709 --> 01:59:00.689]  I just don't understand.
[01:59:00.689 --> 01:59:03.231]  Where's the accountability?
[01:59:03.231 --> 01:59:04.072]  Well, you just said it.
[01:59:04.072 --> 01:59:05.893]  They've gotten away with so many crimes.
[01:59:05.893 --> 01:59:08.796]  Why not just escalate it?
[01:59:08.796 --> 01:59:09.596]  She's pushing it there.
[01:59:09.596 --> 01:59:16.762]  And notice Trump keeps saying to Barr and to Wray, arrest these people, but they won't do it because they're scared.
[01:59:16.762 --> 01:59:18.523]  I don't think they're even really traitors.
[01:59:18.523 --> 01:59:24.668]  They're just scared because, I mean, this is man's work right now, but at least Trump's standing up.
[01:59:24.668 --> 01:59:27.490]  Yeah, I mean, we're living in a time of great iniquity.
[01:59:27.490 --> 01:59:28.611]  And the only thing I could think of to do
[01:59:29.526 --> 01:59:34.570]  is train my neighbors and the people I know how to use their weapons if it comes down to it.
[01:59:34.570 --> 01:59:37.732]  And I don't want it, and I don't want to stir fear with the people.
[01:59:37.732 --> 01:59:43.516]  Sure, but you can't have communist Chinese say, we don't care if the president's elected, we're going to install our agent.
[01:59:43.516 --> 01:59:44.937]  You can't do that.
[01:59:44.937 --> 01:59:46.758]  No, absolutely not.
[01:59:46.758 --> 01:59:52.142]  That's not what I fought for, and I'm trying to protect this country.
[01:59:52.142 --> 01:59:56.705]  What are your other observations, Jacob, and what are your former colleagues in the military saying?
[01:59:58.423 --> 02:00:02.965]  I lost contact with a lot of them, but I've mixed views.
[02:00:02.965 --> 02:00:16.812]  I mean, I've even talked to one guy, a veteran, who said that the Chinese roll in, he's just going to do what they tell him to do, and I've also met... And that's just one, but most of the people I talk to, they're like... So you talked to someone that said he'll follow their orders?
[02:00:16.812 --> 02:00:18.613]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:00:18.613 --> 02:00:20.194]  Surprised the hell out of me.
[02:00:20.194 --> 02:00:26.057]  But, so that element does exist, but 90% of the people I talk to, they're...
[02:00:27.111 --> 02:00:28.052]  They're not going to have it.
[02:00:28.052 --> 02:00:34.317]  You know, we just have to get together and do what we can to protect our neighbors and our families so our children can have a future.
[02:00:34.317 --> 02:00:34.838]  I agree.
[02:00:34.838 --> 02:00:41.283]  Well, it's the globalists and the communists and the leftists and the big tech guys that have been above the law that brought us this place through their insanity.
[02:00:41.283 --> 02:00:42.684]  Almost none of them have been in the military.
[02:00:42.684 --> 02:00:46.628]  That's what's so dangerous about it is you got to fear a bunch of military people in government.
[02:00:47.048 --> 02:00:55.254]  Historically, because sometimes they'll come bad and take over, but not as bad as a group of untrained people who have corporate power who don't know about military consequences.
[02:00:55.254 --> 02:01:03.341]  So you've got a bunch of people playing army that have taken our lack of resistance as weakness instead of taking it as a strength.
[02:01:03.341 --> 02:01:05.362]  And so they're really playing with fire here, brother.
[02:01:05.362 --> 02:01:07.544]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:01:07.544 --> 02:01:14.750]  And just one thing I want to say as well, you know, even back as far back as 2003 when I was in Afghanistan, we were finding brand new Chinese weapons in caves.
[02:01:16.047 --> 02:01:17.668]  You know, that never got any attention.
[02:01:17.668 --> 02:01:19.649]  So even back then, I was just like, what the hell's going on?
[02:01:19.649 --> 02:01:19.929]  That's right.
[02:01:19.929 --> 02:01:20.490]  Let's be clear.
[02:01:20.490 --> 02:01:23.171]  You were basically fighting Chinese arms.
[02:01:23.171 --> 02:01:25.813]  Yeah.
[02:01:25.813 --> 02:01:27.214]  Yeah, we were fighting in the caves.
[02:01:27.214 --> 02:01:32.337]  And the Taliban, Afghanis, whoever, they're all armed up with them.
[02:01:32.337 --> 02:01:33.778]  Brand new, brand new Chinese stuff.
[02:01:33.778 --> 02:01:36.099]  Brand new Chinese weapons and ammo.
[02:01:36.099 --> 02:01:36.500]  Amazing.
[02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:37.961]  Anything else you want to add, Jacob, or are you done?
[02:01:37.961 --> 02:01:39.822]  That's about it, man.
[02:01:39.822 --> 02:01:41.283]  I'm done.
[02:01:41.283 --> 02:01:42.223]  Thank you, sir, for the call.
[02:01:42.223 --> 02:01:42.783]  All right.
[02:01:42.783 --> 02:01:43.324]  60 seconds away.
[02:01:43.324 --> 02:01:44.625]  A bunch of calls straight ahead.
[02:01:44.625 --> 02:01:44.965]  Stay with us.
[02:01:50.452 --> 02:01:57.258]  Miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired and even worshipped for thousands of years by ancient civilizations.
[02:01:57.258 --> 02:02:00.981]  But with modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular.
[02:02:00.981 --> 02:02:08.007]  Its antioxidant effect, its anti-inflammatory effect, everything it does is simply amazing.
[02:02:08.007 --> 02:02:11.530]  And most turmerics out there are simply food products.
[02:02:11.530 --> 02:02:14.633]  They're 3-5% curcuminoid.
[02:02:14.633 --> 02:02:17.575]  But we have body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:02:18.496 --> 02:02:18.596]  Yeah.
[02:02:35.945 --> 02:02:38.087]  What we've got here is failure to communicate.
[02:02:38.087 --> 02:02:39.388]  Some men you just can't reach.
[02:03:02.489 --> 02:03:07.731]  So you can get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it.
[02:03:07.731 --> 02:03:09.132]  Well, he gets it.
[02:03:09.132 --> 02:03:12.393]  I don't like it any more than he does.
[02:03:23.869 --> 02:03:36.600]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[02:03:36.600 --> 02:03:42.005]  Thank you so much for joining us on this live Friday, October 30th, Global Transmission.
[02:03:42.005 --> 02:03:44.767]  Wild Horses could not drag me away.
[02:03:44.767 --> 02:03:45.788]  Coming up at 3 p.m.
[02:03:45.788 --> 02:03:50.912]  Central, you've got Gowaram with Owen Schroer, then you have the special program we've been doing during the election.
[02:03:52.242 --> 02:03:53.823]  Election countdown 7 to 9 p.m.
[02:03:53.823 --> 02:03:57.225]  with DeAnna Lorraine and the rest of the crew.
[02:03:57.225 --> 02:04:04.849]  We will have live election coverage Monday night, Tuesday night, and hopefully it's a decisive victory by Trump, but the Democrats and Pelosi have said they're going to say
[02:04:05.816 --> 02:04:07.537]  That Biden won no matter what.
[02:04:07.537 --> 02:04:09.198]  And that's what we're discussing right now.
[02:04:09.198 --> 02:04:11.119]  How do we respond to that?
[02:04:11.119 --> 02:04:13.640]  Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes joins us at the bottom of the hour.
[02:04:13.640 --> 02:04:16.941]  But right now, let's clear this board of these calls.
[02:04:16.941 --> 02:04:20.783]  There's 10 callers I can see right there and even more on hold below that.
[02:04:20.783 --> 02:04:22.524]  But we're going to go to Delilah.
[02:04:22.524 --> 02:04:28.887]  We're going to go to Tyler, DC, Blake, Ian, Muhammad, Jimmy, Dave, Frank, Peter, and others.
[02:04:28.887 --> 02:04:31.548]  In the order the calls are received.
[02:04:31.548 --> 02:04:34.090]  So let's go ahead and take a call here.
[02:04:35.029 --> 02:04:38.112]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ian in Utah.
[02:04:38.112 --> 02:04:38.672]  You're on the air.
[02:04:38.672 --> 02:04:39.013]  Go ahead.
[02:04:39.013 --> 02:04:43.757]  Hey, Alex strapped in for the next three months.
[02:04:43.757 --> 02:04:45.318]  It's going to be a bumpy ride.
[02:04:45.318 --> 02:04:46.440]  Yeah, I'm ready.
[02:04:46.440 --> 02:04:47.941]  I'm not looking forward to it, but I'm ready.
[02:04:47.941 --> 02:04:48.041]  Yeah.
[02:04:48.041 --> 02:04:49.863]  All right.
[02:04:49.863 --> 02:04:56.609]  Well, first thing that I wanted to get into today was I think that Trump needs to replace Barr with Giuliani.
[02:04:56.609 --> 02:04:58.791]  Giuliani is doing a lot more exposing
[02:04:59.266 --> 02:05:00.907]  The corruption with Hunter Biden.
[02:05:00.907 --> 02:05:03.449]  Bars just kind of sit back, not doing anything.
[02:05:03.449 --> 02:05:08.012]  By the way, Giuliani first sought that position four years ago.
[02:05:08.012 --> 02:05:08.893]  Oh, really?
[02:05:08.893 --> 02:05:10.114]  Yep.
[02:05:10.114 --> 02:05:12.635]  Well, I think he'd really be the man for the job.
[02:05:12.635 --> 02:05:23.703]  He has the Attorney General experience, and he, like you said earlier in your show, he went after the crime families in New York, so I think he could get a lot done.
[02:05:23.703 --> 02:05:24.264]  Absolutely.
[02:05:24.264 --> 02:05:26.305]  He helped bust them up.
[02:05:26.305 --> 02:05:27.906]  Yep.
[02:05:27.906 --> 02:05:28.927]  The entire thing is
[02:05:29.986 --> 02:05:35.810]  No, Jack Dorsey keeps saying that he's not election meddling or anything.
[02:05:35.810 --> 02:05:45.696]  He literally just had something out on his Twitter when I logged in this morning saying the election might be delayed because of mail-in ballots.
[02:05:45.696 --> 02:05:53.540]  Oh yeah, they're all been putting that out for months and then admitting it's their strategy to put out the millions of ballots and then to hold it up and then to claim Trump's a fraud.
[02:05:53.540 --> 02:05:54.941]  I mean, this is going to happen.
[02:05:54.941 --> 02:05:55.822]  Now, will they succeed?
[02:05:55.822 --> 02:05:59.124]  I don't know, but they're going to try to execute this.
[02:05:59.124 --> 02:05:59.624]  Oh, no doubt.
[02:06:02.864 --> 02:06:03.524]  Ian, anything else?
[02:06:18.342 --> 02:06:22.045]  Be a part of it on www.magadragtheinterstate.com.
[02:06:22.045 --> 02:06:23.065]  Let's make this a big one.
[02:06:23.065 --> 02:06:24.487]  Let's have our voices be heard.
[02:06:24.487 --> 02:06:25.067]  It's beautiful.
[02:06:25.067 --> 02:06:27.549]  We're going to be out this weekend in the armored vehicle with Trump gear.
[02:06:27.549 --> 02:06:33.753]  And I see a lot of the crew today wearing Keep America Great hats because you've got to do it.
[02:06:33.753 --> 02:06:39.017]  You've got to exercise it in the face of people that have tried to intimidate us and said we can't.
[02:06:39.017 --> 02:06:43.440]  I mean, when your country, you hear about college students kicked out, high school kids kicked out.
[02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:48.643]  People lose their jobs because they're seen wearing a Trump hat at the movies?
[02:06:48.643 --> 02:06:53.507]  This is, I mean, again, it's wrong to say black people can't go to a lunch line.
[02:06:53.507 --> 02:06:57.210]  Or to say, you know, that if somebody's Hispanic, they can't have a bank account.
[02:06:57.210 --> 02:06:58.331]  That's evil, that's wrong.
[02:06:58.331 --> 02:06:59.472]  That hardly ever happened in U.S.
[02:06:59.472 --> 02:07:00.693]  history, but it's happened.
[02:07:00.693 --> 02:07:06.217]  Imagine saying because you support Trump, or because you're not anti-police, that you can't have a bank account.
[02:07:06.217 --> 02:07:08.980]  Again, I've had a bank for 20 years here in Texas, Texas Bank.
[02:07:09.875 --> 02:07:13.358]  And they closed our bank account about a month ago and I went in there to close it.
[02:07:13.358 --> 02:07:14.739]  I said, what about my kids' accounts?
[02:07:14.739 --> 02:07:20.583]  I got some Tutma, you know, college fund, emergency medical funds, not a lot of money, but you know, bank accounts for my kids.
[02:07:20.583 --> 02:07:26.167]  And they said, we want no relationship with you or anybody in your family.
[02:07:26.167 --> 02:07:28.289]  Under jurisprudence and common law and everything else.
[02:07:29.343 --> 02:07:35.826]  You know, if somebody's dad does something wrong, though I didn't, or their children, you don't say they're guilty.
[02:07:35.826 --> 02:07:36.847]  But that's the left, man.
[02:07:36.847 --> 02:07:43.990]  These are dirty authoritarians, and people have decided to go along with it, and a lot of Americans have abandoned their birthright.
[02:07:43.990 --> 02:07:52.214]  And I was more than happy to leave, I just wanted to know, but they took real pleasure and just said, the directive here is no relationship with you or anybody in your family.
[02:07:56.252 --> 02:08:09.116]  And I'm just, I'm just over not holding these people accountable for what they've done because this is where we are now for not pushing back and not holding anyone accountable for their crimes and now they're just eroding all of our freedoms away.
[02:08:09.116 --> 02:08:11.636]  Damn right Ian, thanks for the call.
[02:08:11.636 --> 02:08:14.337]  Alright, next up, Peter in Denver.
[02:08:14.337 --> 02:08:16.698]  Peter, welcome, go ahead.
[02:08:16.698 --> 02:08:17.778]  Alex.
[02:08:17.778 --> 02:08:19.138]  Alex.
[02:08:19.138 --> 02:08:22.359]  It's good to talk to you, buddy.
[02:08:22.359 --> 02:08:23.719]  Good to talk to you, go ahead.
[02:08:23.719 --> 02:08:24.880]  Yeah, alright.
[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:25.360]  Um, so,
[02:08:25.998 --> 02:08:37.228]  You know, this is a pretty intense time that we're in, and I just have to say this, you know, we war not against flesh and blood, but against powers and principalities and spiritual wickedness in high places.
[02:08:37.228 --> 02:08:41.411]  You know, we are not in a flesh-and-blood kind of war.
[02:08:41.411 --> 02:08:45.855]  This is a new time we're in.
[02:08:45.855 --> 02:08:51.079]  It is really important that every Christian, and especially every InfoWarrior Christian,
[02:08:53.183 --> 02:08:58.585]  Of everything that you can think of that the Holy Spirit would lead you to repent, and fast.
[02:08:58.585 --> 02:09:02.586]  We need to fast like our lives depend on it, and pray.
[02:09:02.586 --> 02:09:07.708]  And when we pray, we need to pray, and pray with authority out loud against this in Jesus' name.
[02:09:07.708 --> 02:09:08.928]  This is the only way we're going to win.
[02:09:08.928 --> 02:09:10.268]  We're not going to win with guns.
[02:09:10.268 --> 02:09:11.789]  We're not going to win with strategy.
[02:09:11.789 --> 02:09:15.110]  We need God to step in and take this thing over.
[02:09:16.192 --> 02:09:18.073]  I hear you, Peter, and I appreciate your call.
[02:09:18.073 --> 02:09:19.193]  Thank you.
[02:09:19.193 --> 02:09:22.374]  All right, up next after Peter is Blake in California.
[02:09:22.374 --> 02:09:24.735]  Blake, go ahead.
[02:09:24.735 --> 02:09:26.395]  Hey, yeah.
[02:09:26.395 --> 02:09:33.918]  So I think nasty, nasty Pelosi is angling to get her nephew made president.
[02:09:33.918 --> 02:09:36.158]  If she can throw it into the Congress, if she can.
[02:09:36.158 --> 02:09:36.679]  Oh, yeah.
[02:09:36.679 --> 02:09:39.159]  Newsome, that little demon Newsome.
[02:09:39.159 --> 02:09:39.660]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:09:39.660 --> 02:09:41.040]  I think she's going to angle to get him.
[02:09:41.576 --> 02:09:57.621]  Elected and but how do we get around so I've got an idea on getting around the tech censorship for this election and after because you say they're gonna probably be tightening up the The internet censorship in the next few days and then the next few months the next 70 something days.
[02:09:57.621 --> 02:10:07.784]  It's gonna be hellish So yeah, so jumping off of what a lady called in yesterday with the idea on The the profile pictures now.
[02:10:07.784 --> 02:10:09.125]  I'm not too familiar with
[02:10:10.717 --> 02:10:13.558]  With social media, I was never really interested in it.
[02:10:13.558 --> 02:10:16.960]  And I got bored back in the days of... Sure, well that's where most people are now.
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:17.780]  That's how they communicate.
[02:10:17.780 --> 02:10:22.863]  So, she was saying have an InfoWars.com or an ElectionNight.News URL.
[02:10:22.863 --> 02:10:26.504]  Leftists won't recognize that, so they'll go to it, not know what they're seeing.
[02:10:26.504 --> 02:10:28.185]  As the profile picture, I think that's a great idea.
[02:10:28.185 --> 02:10:30.846]  What's your other idea?
[02:10:30.846 --> 02:10:32.067]  So, people can post...
[02:10:32.682 --> 02:10:36.906]  Like videos and photos and selfies to these social media, right?
[02:10:36.906 --> 02:10:39.048]  So why do you have to stop with a profile picture?
[02:10:39.048 --> 02:10:43.912]  Can't you just like take selfies of any, take a picture of any... Sure, it hits keywords though.
[02:10:43.912 --> 02:10:47.336]  So if you describe it as Alex Jones or InfoWars, they will take it down.
[02:10:47.336 --> 02:10:55.463]  But if you say, look at this craziness, then the AI will match the photo and see you said crazy and believe people don't get the sarcasm.
[02:10:55.463 --> 02:10:58.186]  So the way to beat it is, look at this piece of filth, Alex Jones.
[02:10:59.358 --> 02:11:01.701]  Damn him to hell, he should have no speech.
[02:11:01.701 --> 02:11:04.325]  They will leave that up.
[02:11:04.325 --> 02:11:12.637]  Because not just the robots won't recognize it, the soulless sociopaths that check it, they don't even know what that means.
[02:11:12.637 --> 02:11:13.839]  They don't get humor, you understand?
[02:11:15.154 --> 02:11:24.698]  Yeah, but in the photograph itself, I just take a picture of a URL, so then it becomes encoded as a... Absolutely, that's how you get around these guys.
[02:11:24.698 --> 02:11:26.558]  Look, how do you beat computers?
[02:11:26.558 --> 02:11:33.041]  When they're having to hack a site, the site will pop up an image that says, put in this code of deformed numbers and letters to get around a computer.
[02:11:33.661 --> 02:11:34.782]  So, exactly.
[02:11:34.782 --> 02:11:42.506]  Just like we use images to beat computers hacking, we can use images to defeat their AI to get messages out.
[02:11:42.506 --> 02:11:43.226]  Absolutely.
[02:11:43.226 --> 02:11:47.528]  And their whole mission is to stop us communicating, so we should be spending time communicating.
[02:11:47.528 --> 02:11:51.110]  But how about painting InfoWars.com on the side of a barn?
[02:11:51.110 --> 02:11:53.871]  Or if you're scared of that URL, how about NewsWars.com?
[02:11:53.871 --> 02:11:56.573]  How about flying an airplane with a URL on the side?
[02:11:56.573 --> 02:11:57.934]  How about just telling people?
[02:11:57.934 --> 02:12:02.016]  Just a little bit every day has a huge effect.
[02:12:02.016 --> 02:12:02.456]  Well, so,
[02:12:03.885 --> 02:12:17.232]  Who's a social media influencer out there who's got YouTube channels that are still up like Watson and and you know Hannity I don't know who else like Tucker Carlson and you guys create some
[02:12:17.894 --> 02:12:27.316]  Uh, videos, and I'll do it too, and we'll create, uh, because people need to be taught how to do this as a new way of communicating through that people haven't really thought of, but taking pictures.
[02:12:27.316 --> 02:12:33.877]  Well, you remember like those military guys a few years ago when they were, the soldiers were saying they weren't going to go to war, uh, in Syria, right?
[02:12:33.877 --> 02:12:36.777]  And so they hold up a piece of paper, cover their face, but still put it out.
[02:12:36.777 --> 02:12:37.458]  Yes.
[02:12:37.458 --> 02:12:38.718]  Communication is king.
[02:12:38.718 --> 02:12:39.918]  It is resistance.
[02:12:39.918 --> 02:12:43.139]  Everyone's got to do it now with only three days, four days, the election.
[02:12:43.139 --> 02:12:44.079]  Thank you so much, Blake.
[02:12:44.079 --> 02:12:45.059]  More calls straight ahead.
[02:12:45.059 --> 02:12:45.439]  Stay with us.
[02:12:48.917 --> 02:12:54.079]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when it comes to the show?
[02:12:54.079 --> 02:13:11.666]  And it's the fact that InfoWars, more than 25 years ago, doing basic research with what the Club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying, developed the hypothesis that communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[02:13:11.666 --> 02:13:12.947]  Well, now China owns the debt.
[02:13:12.947 --> 02:13:15.708]  Now China owns Hollywood, all the one-sided trading deals.
[02:13:16.428 --> 02:13:21.070]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on, but again, it wasn't that hard.
[02:13:21.070 --> 02:13:26.693]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't want to focus on that issue.
[02:13:26.693 --> 02:13:31.215]  We did, and you focused on it by supporting us at InfoWars.
[02:13:31.215 --> 02:13:42.280]  So when you go to InfoWarsStore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts, films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world of what's really happening.
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:44.080]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:45.101]  I want to thank you for your support.
[02:13:48.462 --> 02:14:03.613]  Election 2020 is here, and whether Trump wins or loses, we have all won by exposing the Communist Chinese, by exposing the globalists, by exposing the pedophile rings, by exposing the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil.
[02:14:03.613 --> 02:14:08.176]  Now, I'm personally a Christian, and I believe in God, and I know God's real, and I've experienced it in my life.
[02:14:08.176 --> 02:14:13.460]  But even if you don't believe in God, it's important to recognize that there is good in this world, there is evil.
[02:14:13.460 --> 02:14:16.703]  And there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing bad.
[02:14:17.643 --> 02:14:27.536]  And what I see happening across the spectrum of different political views is people finally get that they finally understand that they're not being naive anymore.
[02:14:27.536 --> 02:14:33.164]  Don't ever project your decency and your goodness onto other people until they've proven what
[02:14:33.524 --> 02:14:34.824]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:15:19.744 --> 02:15:27.710]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:15:27.710 --> 02:15:29.011]  No flashbulbs!
[02:15:33.450 --> 02:15:34.810]  No flashbulbs, no line.
[02:15:34.810 --> 02:15:37.671]  He's haunted by something he cannot define.
[02:15:37.671 --> 02:15:40.111]  Bowels shaking, earthquakes of doubt and remorse.
[02:15:40.111 --> 02:15:42.592]  Assail him, impale him with monster truck force.
[02:15:42.592 --> 02:15:45.352]  In his mind he's still driving, still making the grade.
[02:15:45.352 --> 02:15:47.852]  She's hoping in time that her memories will fade.
[02:15:47.852 --> 02:15:50.633]  Cause he's racing, and pacing, and parting the course.
[02:15:50.633 --> 02:15:53.253]  He's fighting, and fighting, and riding on his horse.
[02:15:53.253 --> 02:15:55.954]  The sun has gone down and the moon has come up.
[02:15:55.954 --> 02:15:58.354]  And long ago somebody left with the cup.
[02:15:58.354 --> 02:16:01.235]  But he's striving, and driving, and hugging the turns.
[02:16:01.235 --> 02:16:02.935]  And thinking of someone for whom he's
[02:16:04.336 --> 02:16:05.457]  He's going!
[02:16:05.457 --> 02:16:06.318]  Woo!
[02:16:06.318 --> 02:16:17.768]  Gonna be back with you.
[02:16:17.768 --> 02:16:18.909]  Taking your calls here.
[02:16:18.909 --> 02:16:22.712]  Alright, Tyler in Wisconsin.
[02:16:22.712 --> 02:16:23.373]  He's up next.
[02:16:23.373 --> 02:16:24.293]  Tyler, thanks for holding.
[02:16:24.293 --> 02:16:24.614]  Go ahead.
[02:16:26.420 --> 02:16:28.082]  Yeah, first time, long time, Alex.
[02:16:28.082 --> 02:16:36.831]  And, you know, a long time ago, seems like a long time ago, probably wasn't that long ago, you said, you were asking a lot of people, you know, what is the symbol of the time we're in?
[02:16:36.831 --> 02:16:43.017]  You'd answered yourself once, you said, you know, the symbol of InfoWars should be the human fist smashing a robot's face forever.
[02:16:44.079 --> 02:16:52.143]  And, you know, robots are one thing to us here in this material world, but to Satan the deception is the robot is a perfectly possessed human being.
[02:16:52.143 --> 02:17:06.890]  And that's what's going on right now, is the bottom line, the basic reality of what we're dealing with, the rest is fluff, is that Satan is looking to possess the world remotely, you know, and create a society where we do that nascently to ourselves.
[02:17:06.890 --> 02:17:09.952]  That's it, it's a giant avatar takeover, you just said it.
[02:17:09.952 --> 02:17:10.172]  Yes.
[02:17:11.233 --> 02:17:19.175]  And the solution is all of us educating ourselves on what exercises these demons in the stages of exorcism.
[02:17:19.175 --> 02:17:25.096]  And as you go out in the streets and you see this coming out of people, that's the demon still holding on to its subject.
[02:17:25.096 --> 02:17:29.217]  And your earlier caller said, our battle is not against flesh and blood.
[02:17:29.217 --> 02:17:36.259]  And we need to evict these demons out of these poor people and notice the signs and know how to do it and be soldiers.
[02:17:36.259 --> 02:17:37.219]  By the way, it's real.
[02:17:37.219 --> 02:17:39.240]  It's like a computer program is running them.
[02:17:40.345 --> 02:17:41.606]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:17:41.606 --> 02:17:42.086]  Brilliant.
[02:17:42.086 --> 02:17:43.507]  Perfect.
[02:17:43.507 --> 02:17:44.088]  No, you're right.
[02:17:44.088 --> 02:17:45.449]  I mean, it's very robotic.
[02:17:45.449 --> 02:17:47.310]  It's like a transmission.
[02:17:47.310 --> 02:17:49.232]  And you go out, they're like, I hate America.
[02:17:49.232 --> 02:17:50.693]  I'll kill the babies.
[02:17:50.693 --> 02:17:53.054]  And you're like, these are like businesswomen and stuff.
[02:17:53.054 --> 02:17:54.195]  It's like it's getting worse.
[02:17:54.195 --> 02:17:55.656]  Something clicks in them.
[02:17:55.656 --> 02:17:59.739]  How do they exponentially, are they mesmerized by the TV?
[02:17:59.739 --> 02:18:01.020]  How do they get put under the spell?
[02:18:01.020 --> 02:18:01.921]  How do they become like this?
[02:18:03.010 --> 02:18:04.311]  This is the great work.
[02:18:04.311 --> 02:18:06.412]  And you know, our enemy has the long game.
[02:18:06.412 --> 02:18:11.594]  Why our battle isn't against flesh and blood is because we were born into this battle.
[02:18:11.594 --> 02:18:21.038]  And these beings that are from another realm that human beings are starting to tune into, whether it's through DMT or TV or, you know, choose your poison.
[02:18:21.038 --> 02:18:24.860]  There's only two transmissions and we only have one antenna.
[02:18:24.860 --> 02:18:26.640]  And we're either tuning into one or the other.
[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:27.981]  Oh, that's so heavy.
[02:18:27.981 --> 02:18:29.082]  Say that again.
[02:18:29.082 --> 02:18:32.023]  There's only two transmissions and we only got one antenna.
[02:18:32.867 --> 02:18:33.468]  That's right.
[02:18:33.468 --> 02:18:35.090]  And you're either tuned into one or the other.
[02:18:35.090 --> 02:18:38.254]  And you can't have one foot in each camp.
[02:18:38.254 --> 02:18:39.936]  We need to get in.
[02:18:39.936 --> 02:18:43.701]  You need to get right right now because that is what propels us forward.
[02:18:43.701 --> 02:18:47.827]  Because human beings, in the long run, we're just one human being.
[02:18:47.827 --> 02:18:48.628]  And when we were born,
[02:18:49.408 --> 02:18:57.954]  In ancient times, to now, is that human being maturing to the point where God knows we're ready to take on the enemy in this fallen world.
[02:18:57.954 --> 02:18:58.795]  And that's now.
[02:18:58.795 --> 02:18:59.355]  And that's us.
[02:18:59.355 --> 02:19:04.118]  And we need to step up to the plate, realize that our enemies could all be fit into one room.
[02:19:04.118 --> 02:19:05.159]  We are the majority.
[02:19:05.159 --> 02:19:05.879]  We are strong.
[02:19:05.879 --> 02:19:07.981]  We are the info warriors.
[02:19:07.981 --> 02:19:12.203]  We are God's transmission on this planet, Alex!
[02:19:12.203 --> 02:19:13.204]  Yeah!
[02:19:13.204 --> 02:19:14.225]  Love you, Tyler.
[02:19:14.225 --> 02:19:16.807]  Yeah, I mean, I'll be honest with people.
[02:19:16.807 --> 02:19:18.768]  You can call it demon possession, whatever you want to call it.
[02:19:20.638 --> 02:19:38.665]  I remember, like, getting in fights where two or three people were ganged up on me, and then, like, really getting angry, and then, like, this other thing took over me, and I was, like, behind it watching it, and it just wanted to destroy people and hurt them, and it totally enjoyed what it was doing, and was very vicious.
[02:19:38.665 --> 02:19:46.128]  You call it an aspect of our human being, what we are, whatever it is, but I just remember, like, sitting back in my consciousness watching it fight.
[02:19:48.103 --> 02:19:52.924]  And it was just enjoying crushing people, and in slow motion, just all of it.
[02:19:52.924 --> 02:19:54.904]  It was pure destruction.
[02:19:54.904 --> 02:19:56.825]  It wanted to destroy people.
[02:19:56.825 --> 02:20:04.967]  And you get around globalists, they don't really have that much of a fire-breathing effect, but they still have like the... They want to wreck things, they want to do bad things.
[02:20:04.967 --> 02:20:07.567]  It's not like they came out of it in a fight fight for their life.
[02:20:07.567 --> 02:20:11.348]  It comes out of them when they're just like teaching a bunch of school kids or something.
[02:20:11.348 --> 02:20:13.188]  They want to hurt things.
[02:20:13.188 --> 02:20:15.069]  And it's very demonic and it's not good.
[02:20:17.346 --> 02:20:22.008]  That's why the enemy wants to get us into wars and stuff to try to trigger that in us and get us to make that connection.
[02:20:22.008 --> 02:20:24.229]  It's not good.
[02:20:24.229 --> 02:20:26.330]  All right, up next, we're going to the order of the calls we received.
[02:20:26.330 --> 02:20:27.510]  Is everybody holding?
[02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:30.792]  Delilah, in Romania.
[02:20:30.792 --> 02:20:31.692]  I should have gone to you earlier.
[02:20:31.692 --> 02:20:32.993]  I didn't notice you were in Romania.
[02:20:32.993 --> 02:20:34.273]  I apologize, Delilah.
[02:20:34.273 --> 02:20:35.674]  Go ahead.
[02:20:35.674 --> 02:20:38.315]  I'm Delia from Romania.
[02:20:38.315 --> 02:20:39.895]  Hi, Alex.
[02:20:39.895 --> 02:20:41.416]  Such a joy to talk to you.
[02:20:41.416 --> 02:20:45.778]  Well, me and my husband are following you from 15 years now.
[02:20:47.482 --> 02:20:51.365]  Well, I read Romania is really awake, probably more than any other country in the New World Order.
[02:20:51.365 --> 02:20:53.627]  Why is that?
[02:20:53.627 --> 02:20:56.089]  We're far away from awake, Alex.
[02:20:56.089 --> 02:20:58.471]  It's a nightmare what's happening here.
[02:20:58.471 --> 02:20:59.692]  I don't know.
[02:20:59.692 --> 02:21:01.874]  I want to tell you three things.
[02:21:01.874 --> 02:21:04.736]  I'm sure a lot of people are waiting to talk to you.
[02:21:04.736 --> 02:21:11.702]  So, I don't know why the mainstream media here, probably televisions you've never heard of, are trashing Trump.
[02:21:13.706 --> 02:21:15.308]  I don't know, it's a nightmare.
[02:21:15.308 --> 02:21:24.076]  Yesterday, they were writing on the bottom of the screen something like, Trump, the man who built towers but destroyed America.
[02:21:24.076 --> 02:21:31.323]  It's so important this man wins the elections because... Sure, so you're saying even your television is demonizing Trump?
[02:21:31.323 --> 02:21:32.004]  Yes!
[02:21:32.004 --> 02:21:35.928]  Like, we are the one who will elect him.
[02:21:35.928 --> 02:21:38.070]  We have elections too in 6th of December.
[02:21:39.880 --> 02:21:41.241]  Well, tell me about Romania.
[02:21:41.241 --> 02:21:44.403]  Tell me about the COVID madness, the lockdowns in Europe, what it's like.
[02:21:44.403 --> 02:21:46.604]  Oh my God.
[02:21:46.604 --> 02:21:49.766]  We have mandatory masks everywhere.
[02:21:49.766 --> 02:21:50.746]  Like everywhere.
[02:21:50.746 --> 02:21:55.068]  Theaters, restaurants, clubs, you name it.
[02:21:55.068 --> 02:21:56.869]  Schools are closed.
[02:21:56.869 --> 02:21:58.590]  All of them.
[02:21:58.590 --> 02:22:05.534]  These kids, I have two children, 16 and 11, and they weren't in school.
[02:22:06.522 --> 02:22:13.424]  Until June, and now they went for two weeks, and they're home again.
[02:22:13.424 --> 02:22:16.926]  And they are not super spreaders.
[02:22:16.926 --> 02:22:17.386]  I don't know.
[02:22:17.386 --> 02:22:26.209]  Yesterday, they are keeping them with the masks on all the time, even when they go out, even when they have to make sports.
[02:22:26.209 --> 02:22:28.570]  That is so bad for them with the carbon dioxide.
[02:22:28.570 --> 02:22:30.250]  It's incredible.
[02:22:30.250 --> 02:22:31.771]  From five years.
[02:22:31.771 --> 02:22:32.411]  From five years.
[02:22:32.850 --> 02:22:41.216]  And yesterday in a park here, a four-year-old was beaten for another three kids.
[02:22:41.216 --> 02:22:43.358]  They were bigger, seven, eight.
[02:22:43.358 --> 02:22:49.983]  Because our president stepped out and said, big heroes wear masks.
[02:22:49.983 --> 02:22:56.087]  Sure, well I know your president's not good, but I've read in general Romania and Hungary and places are really awake to the new world order.
[02:22:56.087 --> 02:22:57.748]  The general public I hear is waking up.
[02:22:57.748 --> 02:23:00.911]  I think that's why they're trying to really put you guys under martial law.
[02:23:02.790 --> 02:23:03.151]  I don't know.
[02:23:18.713 --> 02:23:26.416]  Alright, Dahlia, Dahlia, I said your name wrong earlier because the TV is 20 feet away and my eyes aren't as good as they used to be.
[02:23:26.416 --> 02:23:27.496]  Dahlia, stay there.
[02:23:27.496 --> 02:23:31.838]  Robert Barnes is coming up next, but I'm going to go back to you and have you finish up your call from Romania.
[02:23:31.838 --> 02:23:33.998]  Dahlia, you're giving some really good points.
[02:23:33.998 --> 02:23:36.299]  And Robert Barnes, there's some lawyers on this for a while.
[02:23:36.299 --> 02:23:40.501]  And then we'll talk to Brandon, Mohammed, Jimmy, Dave, Allison.
[02:23:40.501 --> 02:23:42.921]  We're going to tell everybody the order your call comes in.
[02:23:42.921 --> 02:23:43.782]  We really appreciate you.
[02:23:43.782 --> 02:23:44.162]  Stay with us.
[02:23:46.431 --> 02:23:57.235]  The problem with social Darwinism is the so-called elites, the most cunning, smart, inventive people, believe that chivalry doesn't exist anymore.
[02:23:57.235 --> 02:24:02.117]  They don't believe in being aristocrats, trying to hold up civilization and empower the people.
[02:24:02.117 --> 02:24:06.739]  And once the establishment has that predatory idea, civilization collapses very, very quickly.
[02:24:06.739 --> 02:24:11.981]  You can't treat the least of us like garbage and not treat your own family like that.
[02:24:11.981 --> 02:24:14.422]  And so it is this lack of empathy that's going to destroy us.
[02:24:15.763 --> 02:24:25.417]  The Globalists can try to be heartless devil worshippers that commit rituals of all sorts of horrible crime, try to get away from the humanity, but really, they can't escape the laws of the universe.
[02:24:25.417 --> 02:24:30.204]  They may train themselves to commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves, but...
[02:24:31.005 --> 02:24:36.533]  The repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and the very structure itself.
[02:24:36.533 --> 02:24:38.677]  Wealth is created by loving God.
[02:24:38.677 --> 02:24:40.880]  Wealth is created by having a connection to God.
[02:24:40.880 --> 02:24:43.684]  God is the source of all creation, all success, all power.
[02:24:43.684 --> 02:24:45.627]  If you deny that, you'll be destroyed.
[02:24:46.448 --> 02:24:50.712]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed.
[02:24:50.712 --> 02:24:51.913]  And why is that?
[02:24:51.913 --> 02:24:59.721]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree-like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds.
[02:24:59.721 --> 02:25:04.205]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[02:25:04.205 --> 02:25:05.506]  They didn't know why.
[02:25:05.506 --> 02:25:11.252]  Well, with modern science we know it's one of the purest, cleanest organic forms of selenium.
[02:25:11.832 --> 02:25:23.317]  We have BioTrue Selenium, sold out for months, back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com at 50% off, store-wide free shipping, and triple patriot points.
[02:25:23.317 --> 02:25:32.842]  BioTrue Selenium at InfoWarsStore.com is an amazing product, and it's even more amazing in that it funds our operation.
[02:25:32.842 --> 02:25:35.343]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it.
[02:25:35.343 --> 02:25:37.684]  It is an essential nutrient in the body
[02:25:38.064 --> 02:25:39.449]  You absolutely have to have.
[02:25:39.449 --> 02:25:40.874]  It's back in stock.
[02:25:40.874 --> 02:25:41.355]  50% off.
[02:25:41.355 --> 02:25:44.727]  Triple Patriot points at InfoWareStore.com and with free shipping.
[02:25:46.664 --> 02:26:01.534]  Six months ago, the highly respected former head of the Rockefeller Hospital Virology Department went public and said the mainline science on virology is you cannot protect somebody from a virus like this.
[02:26:01.534 --> 02:26:07.999]  You have to wait until there's herd immunity and there's never been a vaccine for any of the coronavirus family of viruses.
[02:26:07.999 --> 02:26:08.800]  They do not work.
[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:13.423]  Well, even Bill Gates now admits, oh, the vaccine will really never work.
[02:26:13.423 --> 02:26:15.805]  But you have to keep social distancing and wearing masks.
[02:26:15.805 --> 02:26:17.667]  They're now saying forever.
[02:26:17.667 --> 02:26:18.848]  Last week, it was 10 years.
[02:26:18.848 --> 02:26:20.189]  Now it's forever.
[02:26:20.189 --> 02:26:21.810]  See how the power grab works?
[02:26:21.810 --> 02:26:34.301]  So when you hear them saying Trump is surrendering and a sheep established surrender to coronavirus, when they say we just have to learn to live with it and boost our immunity with things like vitamin D, C, and, of course, zinc, that's the reality.
[02:26:34.801 --> 02:26:36.243]  That's not fear-mongering.
[02:26:36.243 --> 02:26:40.628]  That's not giving in to the power grab and the endless fear of the New World Order.
[02:26:40.628 --> 02:26:49.279]  They've created a problem to which there is no solution, but they are, again, the people that said they've got to be in charge.
[02:26:49.279 --> 02:26:51.922]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:26:58.948 --> 02:26:59.609]  Yeah.
[02:26:59.609 --> 02:27:03.092]  Here's our new single record from Highwaymen 2 album.
[02:27:03.092 --> 02:27:04.213]  Silver Stallion.
[02:27:04.213 --> 02:27:06.695]  Silver Stallion.
[02:27:06.695 --> 02:27:09.298]  It's Friday.
[02:27:09.298 --> 02:27:10.379]  October 30th, 2020.
[02:27:10.379 --> 02:27:11.600]  Four days out.
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:13.282]  Unbelievable.
[02:27:23.010 --> 02:27:26.952]  And teach him he can trust me like a brother.
[02:27:26.952 --> 02:27:28.793]  One day we'll saddle up.
[02:27:28.793 --> 02:27:30.474]  Crank it up for a minute.
[02:27:30.474 --> 02:27:32.015]  And we're gonna ride.
[02:27:32.015 --> 02:27:34.857]  We're gonna ride.
[02:27:34.857 --> 02:27:37.478]  We were supposed to be off the air by now.
[02:27:51.704 --> 02:27:54.105]  We were supposed to have given up already.
[02:27:54.105 --> 02:27:57.665]  But it didn't work that way.
[02:27:57.665 --> 02:27:59.706]  Because we stood together.
[02:27:59.706 --> 02:28:00.426]  That didn't hype.
[02:28:00.426 --> 02:28:01.106]  That's reality.
[02:28:01.106 --> 02:28:01.806]  You did it.
[02:28:01.806 --> 02:28:04.087]  We did it.
[02:28:04.087 --> 02:28:06.888]  I'm gonna find me a reckless woman.
[02:28:06.888 --> 02:28:09.208]  With razor blades and dice in her eyes.
[02:28:09.208 --> 02:28:11.709]  One more little piece of the song.
[02:28:11.709 --> 02:28:17.570]  I'm gonna find me a reckless woman.
[02:28:17.570 --> 02:28:21.131]  Razor blades and dice in her eyes.
[02:28:23.959 --> 02:28:28.341]  Just a touch of sadness in her fingers.
[02:28:28.341 --> 02:28:35.543]  Thunder and lightning in her thighs.
[02:28:35.543 --> 02:28:36.983]  And we're gonna ride.
[02:28:36.983 --> 02:28:39.804]  And we're gonna ride.
[02:28:39.804 --> 02:28:49.788]  Alright, Robert Barnes, constitutional lawyer, good friend of mine, smart historian, smartest guys I know, joins us in just a little while, then we'll go back to your phone calls.
[02:28:51.715 --> 02:28:53.196]  You're looking at tyranny right now.
[02:28:53.196 --> 02:28:59.661]  They are now announcing the contact tracing in Europe, the apps to travel, now Michigan, other client states are doing it.
[02:28:59.661 --> 02:29:05.625]  The Attorney General in Minnesota is saying Trump's not allowed to have a rally, violate the First Amendment.
[02:29:05.625 --> 02:29:07.366]  This is incredible.
[02:29:07.366 --> 02:29:09.247]  This is over the top.
[02:29:09.247 --> 02:29:11.249]  You have martial law being declared all over Europe.
[02:29:12.239 --> 02:29:17.222]  All stores to be closed, including places to eat, as people flee.
[02:29:17.222 --> 02:29:18.863]  What's the big picture globally?
[02:29:18.863 --> 02:29:20.524]  What's happened with the election?
[02:29:20.524 --> 02:29:21.705]  What should be done about this?
[02:29:21.705 --> 02:29:27.909]  As we know, the lockdown, the Democrats admit, Whitmer has said she wants to use it to drive us into not voting for Trump.
[02:29:27.909 --> 02:29:30.511]  I think it's backfired on them, but they're doubling down.
[02:29:30.511 --> 02:29:32.452]  Robert Barnes, what in hell is going on here?
[02:29:32.452 --> 02:29:35.454]  Oh, it's definitely extraordinary times.
[02:29:35.454 --> 02:29:37.175]  I mean, what you're looking at in terms of
[02:29:37.714 --> 02:29:44.204]  The track and tracing that's taking place is they're now making it a condition, like in Michigan, of operating your business.
[02:29:44.204 --> 02:29:52.716]  You can't operate your business unless you become an agent of the state and track and trace your own customers for the benefit of the state surveillance.
[02:29:53.188 --> 02:30:08.736]  So it's surveillance capitalism that's taken a whole different angle and a whole different edge where your condition of your business operation is being a component of this track and trace mechanism that's meant to control populations en masse.
[02:30:08.736 --> 02:30:15.480]  And while that's happening on the one side, you have the extraordinary big tech censorship and manipulation taking place in the election.
[02:30:15.956 --> 02:30:17.457]  That's overt and open now.
[02:30:17.457 --> 02:30:22.979]  What is previously subtle and hidden is now clear for everyone to witness.
[02:30:22.979 --> 02:30:24.820]  I still think Trump will win the election.
[02:30:24.820 --> 02:30:28.981]  I think he'll win it despite all of these obstacles and burdens.
[02:30:28.981 --> 02:30:32.443]  And I think he may even win it by the kind of margin that will make it tough.
[02:30:32.443 --> 02:30:34.623]  I think it'll be outside the margin of fraud.
[02:30:34.623 --> 02:30:41.086]  I think it'll be too, the margins will be too big and too many key swing states for them to even successfully steal it.
[02:30:41.553 --> 02:30:48.334]  But people have to be prepped and prepared for a legal onslaught that will make Bush v. Gore look like a walk in the park.
[02:30:48.334 --> 02:31:00.296]  The team of lawyers, the army of lawyers that Democrats are amassing, and as Biden Freudian slipped and said, they had built the greatest voter fraud organization in American history.
[02:31:00.296 --> 02:31:10.478]  Well, that Freudian slip was very revelatory, and it's what the entire country faces, because if Trump wins, the press and the polling community that supports the press
[02:31:10.891 --> 02:31:15.798]  Has already said that they're going to claim it was stolen solely because their bogus polls predicted he couldn't win.
[02:31:17.483 --> 02:31:39.941]  Well that's exactly where I was going next, and I should have pointed out you're not just a famous constitutional lawyer that's very respected, but you're also the guy, when you even go to Bloomberg, they say you're the biggest political bettor in the world, that you made $300,000 just in Ireland alone, betting on Trump in an upset, I guess over a million total or whatever, on bets then four years ago.
[02:31:39.941 --> 02:31:43.784]  So you really do your due diligence, and I agree with you, landslide for Trump, except
[02:31:44.284 --> 02:31:46.224]  They're not going to concede.
[02:31:46.224 --> 02:31:50.445]  And now Pelosi came out and said, we don't care if Trump says he wins.
[02:31:50.445 --> 02:31:51.665]  Biden will be seated.
[02:31:51.665 --> 02:31:56.086]  And she said three months ago, we're just going to have our own inauguration and split the country up.
[02:31:56.086 --> 02:32:00.007]  I mean, these people have got a lot of chutzpah.
[02:32:00.007 --> 02:32:00.607]  No doubt about it.
[02:32:00.607 --> 02:32:04.888]  I mean, they're attempting to allow ballots to be counted for days or even weeks.
[02:32:04.888 --> 02:32:06.288]  Pennsylvania, it's three days.
[02:32:06.288 --> 02:32:08.188]  In North Carolina, it's over a week.
[02:32:08.188 --> 02:32:13.529]  In Nevada, it's up to two weeks where they can be counting ballots that come in after Election Day.
[02:32:14.008 --> 02:32:22.356]  So clearly they're trying to make that margin of fraud as big and as broad as possible to make it as impossible as possible for Trump to win.
[02:32:22.356 --> 02:32:28.982]  So I think all of those dynamics clearly point to a problematic component for what's going to happen.
[02:32:28.982 --> 02:32:37.590]  And Trump's team and everybody behind Trump has to be prepped and prepared because we're going to see a scale and scope of activity that we have not witnessed before.
[02:32:37.987 --> 02:32:41.128]  And we know it's not going to be Democrats claiming that, oh, he cheated.
[02:32:41.128 --> 02:32:43.610]  They're going to claim, oh, minorities are angry.
[02:32:43.610 --> 02:32:44.990]  You stole this from Biden.
[02:32:44.990 --> 02:32:48.492]  And they're going to try to activate these anti-fag, white...
[02:32:49.386 --> 02:32:50.487]  There's no doubt about it.
[02:32:50.487 --> 02:32:55.589]  We've been living through a real-life Milgram experiment and there's an attempt to assert complete state control over the West.
[02:33:18.382 --> 02:33:30.147]  And we're seeing it in increasing scale and scope, and they got away with a lot of what they did in the lockdown, they got away with a lot of these test and tracing experiments, so they're just going to unleash them on a different level.
[02:33:30.147 --> 02:33:37.771]  They let China open up that introductory mechanism of controlling the population in the guise of virus control, and they're just going to continue to expand.
[02:33:37.771 --> 02:33:43.413]  And then the one thing holding them back is the re-election of Donald Trump.
[02:33:43.413 --> 02:33:45.634]  The re-election of Donald Trump is the greatest hindrance
[02:33:47.982 --> 02:33:51.604]  Absolutely.
[02:33:51.604 --> 02:33:54.425]  I still get a few people on the street go, is Trump for real?
[02:33:54.425 --> 02:33:56.946]  I mean, he really thinks he's the president.
[02:33:56.946 --> 02:33:57.747]  Does he make mistakes?
[02:33:57.747 --> 02:34:01.729]  Yeah, but he's actually being the president and he's pissed off all these special interests.
[02:34:01.729 --> 02:34:03.209]  How would you quantify that for folks?
[02:34:03.209 --> 02:34:08.132]  Just because he's a real president and isn't out to get us and is a good guy doesn't mean we agree with everything he does.
[02:34:08.132 --> 02:34:12.854]  But clearly he is the president when a foreign group is taking control of the country and they're pissed.
[02:34:14.359 --> 02:34:19.380]  He's the only person in the entire Western world outside of Sweden that's pushing back on lockdowns.
[02:34:19.380 --> 02:34:21.421]  I mean, that gives you an idea for him.
[02:34:21.421 --> 02:34:22.441]  He's still independent.
[02:34:22.441 --> 02:34:23.821]  He still follows his own instincts.
[02:34:23.821 --> 02:34:28.603]  He still follows his populist guidance of what the working class voters have put him in there for.
[02:34:28.603 --> 02:34:31.423]  And you can see it in the degree of opposition.
[02:34:31.423 --> 02:34:41.586]  When Big Tech is willing to go to great lengths to censor information about Hunter Biden, they're only doing that because they believe that Trump is the greatest threat to their consolidation of power.
[02:34:41.997 --> 02:34:49.185]  The Deep State isn't doing the shenanigans that they're up to, but for thinking that Donald Trump is the greatest threat to their consolidation of power.
[02:34:49.185 --> 02:34:55.453]  The massive donations coming in from Wall Street, Park Avenue, Silicon Valley, San Francisco, D.C.
[02:34:55.453 --> 02:34:57.215]  is pouring into Biden's campaign.
[02:34:57.648 --> 02:35:03.731]  Because they think anything other than Trump is the greatest hindrance to their ability to control power.
[02:35:03.731 --> 02:35:13.595]  So whatever his imperfections, he is, from a populist perspective, the only obstacle to the establishment teasing and monopolizing control moving forward.
[02:35:14.355 --> 02:35:18.540]  And let's define this from a Wall Street perspective, just using that as a keystone.
[02:35:18.540 --> 02:35:27.732]  There's many angles to look at this, but from that one, why would Wall Street, even though under Trump, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, they've all made the biggest profits in their history, why do they hate him?
[02:35:27.732 --> 02:35:30.115]  Because they like to create artificial contractions
[02:35:30.876 --> 02:35:32.736]  No doubt about it.
[02:35:32.736 --> 02:35:34.277]  I mean, the willingness to use a virus
[02:35:58.994 --> 02:35:59.835]  We're good to go.
[02:36:27.762 --> 02:36:30.343]  Robert Barnes, let's chronicle that when we come back.
[02:36:30.343 --> 02:36:31.064]  I mean, how?
[02:36:31.064 --> 02:36:34.185]  Eight months ago this starts from China, now the whole world's China.
[02:36:34.185 --> 02:36:35.446]  They admit the lockdown never ends.
[02:36:35.446 --> 02:36:36.986]  Bill Gates says ten years.
[02:36:36.986 --> 02:36:38.567]  The UN says it never ends.
[02:36:38.567 --> 02:36:40.808]  I mean, we have to start saying no now.
[02:36:40.808 --> 02:36:42.289]  There's no doubt in pushing back.
[02:36:42.289 --> 02:36:44.209]  Because the handcuffs are going on.
[02:36:44.209 --> 02:36:45.370]  The chains are going on.
[02:36:45.370 --> 02:36:46.891]  You're only here on air, facing...
[02:36:47.631 --> 02:36:52.034]  The Globalist onsought, the DMC-funded lawsuits, and everything that's happening because of you.
[02:36:52.034 --> 02:36:59.340]  We built the only truly multimedia, independent radio, TV, print, film organization in the world that promotes the truth against the Globalists.
[02:36:59.340 --> 02:37:00.601]  We've had a devastating effect.
[02:37:00.601 --> 02:37:01.862]  We're a national treasure.
[02:37:01.862 --> 02:37:04.143]  You're a national treasure for supporting us.
[02:37:04.143 --> 02:37:05.464]  And so, go get a t-shirt.
[02:37:05.464 --> 02:37:06.826]  Go get a historic t-shirt.
[02:37:07.606 --> 02:37:10.528]  We've got a funny one that's the Biden groping a woman.
[02:37:10.528 --> 02:37:11.849]  It's a woman's design shirt.
[02:37:11.849 --> 02:37:12.810]  My wife really likes it.
[02:37:12.810 --> 02:37:13.730]  She sent me this gift.
[02:37:13.730 --> 02:37:14.411]  It's pretty cute.
[02:37:14.411 --> 02:37:14.871]  Here it is.
[02:37:14.871 --> 02:37:16.632]  And it just, you know, it's a little historic thing.
[02:37:16.632 --> 02:37:17.953]  I think Trump's gonna win.
[02:37:17.953 --> 02:37:20.795]  But if Biden's able to steal it, we'll be probably shut down pretty quick.
[02:37:20.795 --> 02:37:22.356]  So it'll be a historic thing to have.
[02:37:22.356 --> 02:37:31.443]  You'll only be able to fight them in the third dimension on the street with graffiti, with handbills you hand out, and with noncompliance, not paying taxes, and pulling your kids out of the schools, and
[02:37:32.103 --> 02:37:37.325]  Just making it a full-time job to expose and fight and obstruct the criminal foreign takeover of America.
[02:37:37.325 --> 02:37:38.525]  We've gotten to that point.
[02:37:38.525 --> 02:37:39.625]  Biden for nursing home.
[02:37:39.625 --> 02:37:41.866]  I hope to retire Biden and that'd be a collector's item.
[02:37:41.866 --> 02:37:42.866]  Get it while you still can.
[02:37:42.866 --> 02:37:43.786]  We're not ordering more.
[02:37:43.786 --> 02:37:45.427]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:37:45.427 --> 02:37:53.289]  Infowars has been reporting on the dark, unpleasant truths of big government corruption for over two decades.
[02:37:53.289 --> 02:37:55.350]  It is why they attack us.
[02:37:55.350 --> 02:37:59.471]  And it is why we are now the most banned broadcast in the world.
[02:38:00.700 --> 02:38:05.463]  The Hunter Biden hard drive scandal is merely the tip of the iceberg.
[02:38:05.463 --> 02:38:08.064]  Evil has infested governments everywhere.
[02:38:08.064 --> 02:38:13.527]  But the evil establishment is censoring content across all media platforms.
[02:38:13.527 --> 02:38:17.549]  They blocked you from sharing banned.video on social media.
[02:38:17.549 --> 02:38:23.553]  So go to electionnight.news and share it like your lives depended on it.
[02:38:25.100 --> 02:38:33.348]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID, vaccines, Bill Gates, and Big Pharma.
[02:38:33.348 --> 02:38:40.814]  Go to electionnight.news to find all the information the crooked establishment is most afraid of.
[02:38:40.814 --> 02:38:44.137]  Go to electionnight.news and share now.
[02:38:46.789 --> 02:38:51.251]  Two Info Wars best-selling products are now back in stock for being sold out for months.
[02:38:51.251 --> 02:38:57.275]  BioTree Selenium from the mustard seed, essential in all electrochemical activity in the cells in the body.
[02:38:57.275 --> 02:38:59.216]  That's every human activity.

[02:39:12.823 --> 02:39:17.807]  So both these are amazing products, and they fund the InfoWar, which is a 360 win.
[02:39:17.807 --> 02:39:28.116]  On top of it, despite the fact they're in demand, they've been sold out for months, they're both 50% off, triple Patriot points, and free shipping at InfoWarStore.com.

[02:39:32.978 --> 02:39:38.560]  And on top of it, we also have Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:39:38.560 --> 02:39:40.221]  This sale will not last long.

[02:39:41.661 --> 02:39:43.082]  We really need to try these products.

[02:39:51.045 --> 02:39:53.586]  This is taken under the tongue.
[02:39:53.586 --> 02:39:54.747]  It is pure turmeric.
[02:39:55.780 --> 02:40:04.985]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[02:40:04.985 --> 02:40:10.829]  This is absorbed under the tongue, into the bloodstream, and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[02:40:10.829 --> 02:40:12.990]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[02:40:13.430 --> 02:40:16.673]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[02:40:16.673 --> 02:40:18.514]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[02:40:18.514 --> 02:40:20.636]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[02:40:20.636 --> 02:40:22.818]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[02:40:22.818 --> 02:40:24.179]  Some like bodies better.
[02:40:24.179 --> 02:40:28.322]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[02:40:28.322 --> 02:40:29.503]  And they fund the InfoWare.

[02:41:14.492 --> 02:41:19.376]  Imagine hearing me read this headline a year ago.
[02:41:19.376 --> 02:41:23.480]  You'd think that's never gonna happen.
[02:41:23.480 --> 02:41:26.102]  But now here it is.
[02:41:26.102 --> 02:41:28.544]  Only three days to the election.
[02:41:28.544 --> 02:41:32.468]  It's unfolding right now.
[02:41:32.468 --> 02:41:35.911]  President Trump says he's heading to Minnesota tonight.
[02:41:36.738 --> 02:41:50.626]  Despite radical state Democrat leaders limiting his crowd to 250, citing COVID, but promoting Black Lives Matter, burning down major cities.
[02:41:50.626 --> 02:41:55.869]  Openly saying we can veto the First Amendment, even though federal and state courts have said they can't.
[02:41:55.869 --> 02:41:58.370]  It's so damn transparent.
[02:41:58.370 --> 02:42:01.332]  Keith Ellison wields power to restrict freedom of assembly.
[02:42:01.332 --> 02:42:03.233]  Political opponents of Minnesota Trump rally.
[02:42:04.161 --> 02:42:10.305]  He also said, I played the clip already, I'm not going to play it again, that women shouldn't call the police when they're raped.
[02:42:10.305 --> 02:42:12.766]  Well, he's been reportedly raping women quite a bit.
[02:42:12.766 --> 02:42:15.728]  I mean, and you're like, this doesn't make sense, because they're crazy people.
[02:42:15.728 --> 02:42:19.731]  We're going to go to Robert Barnes here in a moment.
[02:42:19.731 --> 02:42:21.152]  He'll be with us next hour for 30 minutes.
[02:42:21.152 --> 02:42:22.052]  We'll take your calls then.
[02:42:22.052 --> 02:42:28.997]  You'll be on with Barnes, Muhammad, Manny, and Ed, DC, and David, and Allison, and Harrington, everybody that they're patiently holding, Harrison.
[02:42:30.464 --> 02:42:33.105]  Separately, now is the time to support InfoWars.
[02:42:33.105 --> 02:42:34.205]  We're still on air.
[02:42:34.205 --> 02:42:35.506]  Barely thanks for your support.
[02:42:35.506 --> 02:42:36.266]  I appreciate it.
[02:42:36.266 --> 02:42:37.366]  It's changed the world.
[02:42:37.366 --> 02:42:38.827]  But we've got supplements you need.
[02:42:38.827 --> 02:42:41.608]  X2, X3 are high-quality forms of iodine.
[02:42:41.608 --> 02:42:42.368]  Different formulas.
[02:42:42.368 --> 02:42:43.749]  They both work differently.
[02:42:43.749 --> 02:42:44.589]  That are essential.
[02:42:44.589 --> 02:42:46.490]  Most people are deficient in iodine.
[02:42:46.490 --> 02:42:47.570]  It's an essential thing.
[02:42:47.570 --> 02:42:48.770]  You've got to have it to live.
[02:42:48.770 --> 02:42:51.951]  It's a game changer for stamina, libido, energy, everything.
[02:42:51.951 --> 02:42:52.532]  Get it.
[02:42:52.532 --> 02:42:54.252]  That's what I do for my immune system.
[02:42:54.252 --> 02:42:55.673]  InfoWarsStore.com.

[02:43:24.152 --> 02:43:28.094]  Storewide free shipping, triple patron points, that'll be our new sale next week.

[02:43:38.708 --> 02:43:41.989]  The antioxidant effect, the autoimmune effect is incredible.
[02:43:41.989 --> 02:43:44.350]  Biotryoselenium is all your electrochemical activities.
[02:43:44.350 --> 02:43:45.490]  I could be exhausted.
[02:43:45.490 --> 02:43:49.211]  Take some fish oil and some Biotryoselenium.
[02:43:49.211 --> 02:43:49.831]  Massive energy.
[02:43:51.246 --> 02:43:52.747]  It does boost your testosterone.
[02:43:52.747 --> 02:43:53.868]  Your hair will fall out.
[02:43:53.868 --> 02:43:54.649]  So what?
[02:43:54.649 --> 02:43:57.671]  The point is, is that that, yes, what I'm on, I'm on selenium.
[02:43:57.671 --> 02:43:58.392]  I'm on bodies.
[02:43:58.392 --> 02:43:59.613]  I'm on X2.
[02:43:59.613 --> 02:44:01.014]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:44:01.014 --> 02:44:01.395]  All right.
[02:44:01.395 --> 02:44:04.958]  Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes, you just heard me lay this out.
[02:44:04.958 --> 02:44:07.159]  You were better than me.
[02:44:07.159 --> 02:44:08.120]  It's true.
[02:44:08.120 --> 02:44:09.742]  You and gateway pundit Jim Hoft.
[02:44:10.262 --> 02:44:14.843]  Eight, nine months ago, we're telling me on air and off air, Jones, I know you're hedging your bet.
[02:44:14.843 --> 02:44:16.463]  You see the lockdown in China.
[02:44:16.463 --> 02:44:18.104]  This is overall a hoax.
[02:44:18.104 --> 02:44:19.524]  It's a bad flu maximum.
[02:44:19.524 --> 02:44:21.205]  They're counting deaths of other people.
[02:44:21.205 --> 02:44:21.825]  It's a U.N.
[02:44:21.825 --> 02:44:22.485]  operation.
[02:44:22.485 --> 02:44:23.865]  So what if it's man-made?
[02:44:23.865 --> 02:44:25.145]  That's so Gates can own it.
[02:44:25.145 --> 02:44:27.426]  This is going to be a permanent lockdown.
[02:44:27.426 --> 02:44:29.826]  They're going to use it to control people.
[02:44:29.826 --> 02:44:31.347]  And for about a month, I wasn't sure.
[02:44:31.347 --> 02:44:33.007]  I just give credit where it's due.
[02:44:33.007 --> 02:44:34.548]  You were ahead of me on that.
[02:44:34.548 --> 02:44:35.828]  You are the Grand Poobah.
[02:44:36.788 --> 02:44:40.551]  Uh, other than maybe Jim Hoff, but you have a legal perspective on what this really is.
[02:44:40.551 --> 02:44:48.577]  So spend time on what COVID is, what it's being used for, what we're facing lockdown to and what we should do to resist it.
[02:44:48.577 --> 02:44:49.157]  No doubt about it.
[02:44:49.157 --> 02:44:55.922]  I mean, I think what happened was you had something that we, you know, we had the Asian flu of 1958, the Hong Kong flu of 1968.
[02:44:55.922 --> 02:45:01.746]  Both of those were much more lethal in terms and in a broader population of lethality than this flu is.
[02:45:02.259 --> 02:45:08.082]  And yet we've reacted in ways we've never reacted to any virus in history, not even the Spanish flu.
[02:45:08.082 --> 02:45:16.946]  Did we shut down civil society, shut down economies, shut down all small businesses, prohibit, basically put everybody under mass house arrest.
[02:45:16.946 --> 02:45:20.748]  And that is in fact what we're doing on a recurrent basis across the West.
[02:45:20.748 --> 02:45:28.151]  Even when the World Health Organization and other people conceded that this was a bad medical strategy, we're seeing it unleashed again throughout Europe.
[02:45:28.151 --> 02:45:30.392]  We're seeing it unleashed again in parts of the United States.
[02:45:30.908 --> 02:45:33.791]  Because they love the power and the control that comes with it.
[02:45:33.791 --> 02:45:38.515]  So it's an experiment in social control, and they've found that most people will comply.
[02:45:38.515 --> 02:45:45.961]  And that because they think most people will comply continuously and ceaselessly, they're not going to give up this power and their control once they have it.
[02:45:45.961 --> 02:45:50.225]  Just as when they figured out people would go along with the kind of invasive checks at airports
[02:45:50.660 --> 02:45:57.168]  After 9-11 only led to them accelerating and institutionalizing that control of the population.
[02:45:57.168 --> 02:46:00.292]  The same thing is intended now on a massive scale.
[02:46:00.292 --> 02:46:07.420]  And the next great risk, aside from additional and continuous and endless lockdown, is forced vaccination.
[02:46:08.087 --> 02:46:24.413]  Uh, is requiring people as a condition of employment, a condition of education, a condition simply of civil participation, probably even a condition of voting down the road that you have to have accepted the vaccine from whatever government agency Fauci says is okay.
[02:46:25.146 --> 02:46:27.648]  Uh, and there's an internal divide as to what's going on there.
[02:46:27.648 --> 02:46:28.689]  We're Fauci favorites.
[02:46:45.592 --> 02:46:46.052]  Well, exactly.
[02:46:46.052 --> 02:46:48.754]  We have never had a successful coronavirus vaccine in history, in medical history.
[02:46:48.754 --> 02:46:50.796]  There's very little evidence of a successful flu vaccine over time.
[02:47:09.336 --> 02:47:10.998]  It's almost like you could take a drug,
[02:47:28.610 --> 02:47:33.192]  And suddenly you call it vaccine, and magically it's blessed by God.
[02:47:33.192 --> 02:47:34.712]  And suddenly it's now perfect.
[02:47:34.712 --> 02:47:35.272]  Exactly!
[02:47:35.272 --> 02:47:39.894]  They've got vaccines that reprogram the brain with viruses that eat certain receptors.
[02:47:39.894 --> 02:47:41.054]  That's not a vaccine.
[02:47:41.054 --> 02:47:42.615]  That's a viral lobotomy.
[02:47:42.615 --> 02:47:46.416]  They're just calling new classes of nanotech drugs vaccines.
[02:47:46.416 --> 02:47:58.000]  Exactly, because they found that they've been able to suppress dissent on the issue of vaccines, that as long as they just relabel the name of the drug, call it vaccine, people think it's something safe like a warm blanket for a baby in the winter.
[02:47:58.447 --> 02:48:02.215]  When in fact it's medical experimentation on human beings.
[02:48:03.202 --> 02:48:15.332]  And under the guise of vaccinations, under the guise of public health, is how we got forced sterilization in the teens and the 20s, which ultimately was the intellectual breeding ground for the Nazi experimentation of the 1930s.
[02:48:15.332 --> 02:48:22.577]  And then we got Tuskegee and everything came out of, not America, but the mad scientists in England and America.
[02:48:22.577 --> 02:48:26.660]  People go, I love America, but we literally created Hitler on record.
[02:48:26.660 --> 02:48:28.762]  They used that as defense in the Nuremberg trial.
[02:48:30.160 --> 02:48:31.964]  Exactly, because they found it.
[02:48:31.964 --> 02:48:33.747]  It came from English and American.
[02:48:33.747 --> 02:48:37.414]  Once you embrace the ideas of eugenics and human experimentation...
[02:48:37.833 --> 02:48:41.134]  There was no moral or legal limits to where that could go.
[02:48:41.134 --> 02:48:42.575]  And we know where it ended up.
[02:48:42.575 --> 02:48:44.335]  It ended up in Nazi experimentation.
[02:48:44.335 --> 02:48:46.796]  It ended up in forced sterilizations.
[02:48:46.796 --> 02:48:53.319]  And so I want black folks and white folks to riot against forced inoculation, not because a cop might have shot somebody who's wrong.
[02:48:53.319 --> 02:48:55.059]  You don't blame the whole cops for that.
[02:48:55.059 --> 02:48:59.201]  But you do blame a corrupt government with Bill Gates coming to shoot us up with dangerous stuff.
[02:48:59.201 --> 02:49:04.563]  And I'm not calling for violence, but I'm saying it's going to be legitimate, Bob, if they keep pushing this crap.
[02:49:04.563 --> 02:49:04.883]  No doubt.
[02:49:04.883 --> 02:49:07.204]  I think it's something that the deep state apparatus underestimates.
[02:49:07.705 --> 02:49:14.747]  If they remove the ability to democratically check the excesses of the deep state apparatus, what options are people left with?
[02:49:14.747 --> 02:49:16.047]  It's not good options.
[02:49:16.047 --> 02:49:18.368]  So that's why we need democracy to succeed.
[02:49:18.368 --> 02:49:20.048]  We need democracy to survive.
[02:49:20.048 --> 02:49:22.008]  We need democracy to be sustained.
[02:49:22.008 --> 02:49:26.069]  And that means our courts need to be open and enforcing our constitutional rights and liberties.
[02:49:26.069 --> 02:49:36.032]  And that means Donald Trump needs to get re-elected president, because otherwise we will face a status onslaught of the kind we haven't seen anywhere in the Western world since the rise of fascism and communism in the 1930s.
[02:49:38.424 --> 02:49:39.225]  You're damn right.
[02:49:39.225 --> 02:49:39.885]  Keep going here.
[02:49:39.885 --> 02:49:46.850]  We're going to take calls next hour, but I mean, this is such a naked power grab and they're foaming at the mouth, but I see it as a sign of desperation.
[02:49:46.850 --> 02:49:51.232]  They're trying to act overconfident and the UN and the globalists are pushing this because they're in trouble.
[02:49:51.232 --> 02:49:54.134]  I don't think they're doing this because they're strong, Bob.
[02:49:54.134 --> 02:49:54.595]  No, I agree.
[02:49:54.595 --> 02:49:55.715]  It's a sign of weakness.
[02:49:55.715 --> 02:50:00.819]  Big tech knows more about what's happening in the election than anybody because of their algorithms.
[02:50:00.819 --> 02:50:05.642]  And yet they were willing to show the world their overt
[02:50:06.175 --> 02:50:08.537]  Open corruption and censoring the Hunter Biden speech.
[02:50:08.537 --> 02:50:08.877]  That's right.
[02:50:08.877 --> 02:50:13.620]  They wouldn't be intensifying under scrutiny if they weren't under orders and scared.
[02:50:13.620 --> 02:50:14.080]  Exactly.
[02:50:14.080 --> 02:50:20.165]  There's no reason for them to expose themselves and show their hand unless their internal data shows Trump's going to win.
[02:50:20.165 --> 02:50:26.969]  So that means they have to manipulate all sources of information and all means of that information being distributed and dispersed.
[02:50:26.969 --> 02:50:28.410]  It's what we've been talking about for years.
[02:50:28.410 --> 02:50:35.315]  And the reason why they used you as the template was to try to control and gatekeep information for this election and for this scheme.
[02:50:35.837 --> 02:50:49.504]  It's not, because this election is also about their ability and their capacity to force vaccines on people, to force continuous lockdowns, to continue to stress the system and see how much social coercion and social compliance they can get out of the public.
[02:50:49.504 --> 02:50:53.126]  Which they've all made record profits of consolidating and killing the local economy.
[02:50:53.126 --> 02:51:00.250]  I mean, this is literal genocide against the third world, physically genociding its businesses in the first world.
[02:51:00.250 --> 02:51:00.630]  Exactly.
[02:51:00.630 --> 02:51:03.532]  We've seen a favoritism for the Costco's and the Walmart's
[02:51:04.005 --> 02:51:04.845]  I agree, stay there.
[02:51:04.845 --> 02:51:10.128]  You know, and I don't want it to happen, but people are going to start experimenting on these big tech people with lead and with cold steel.
[02:51:10.128 --> 02:51:11.889]  I mean, you know, it's like, hey, we're U.S.
[02:51:11.889 --> 02:51:15.350]  Code, Title 50, Chapter 32, Subsection 1528, Paragraph B, said it was legalized to do secret testing.
[02:51:15.350 --> 02:51:16.991]  We'll just call this secret testing then.
[02:51:35.131 --> 02:51:38.972]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[02:51:38.972 --> 02:51:43.293]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[02:51:43.293 --> 02:51:51.816]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[02:51:52.176 --> 02:52:08.770]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[02:52:08.770 --> 02:52:19.839]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[02:52:20.299 --> 02:52:28.802]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[02:52:28.802 --> 02:52:36.624]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:52:36.624 --> 02:52:39.485]  Something huge has happened in the last two weeks.
[02:52:39.485 --> 02:52:42.066]  Remember when Hunter Biden's laptop first broke?
[02:52:43.325 --> 02:52:51.255]  And all of big tech in concert from Twitter to Facebook to YouTube, Google, all worked to block it.
[02:52:51.255 --> 02:52:52.316]  They didn't deny that it was real.
[02:52:52.316 --> 02:53:01.126]  They just wouldn't let anybody even talk about the story or link to major newspapers or even the House and Senate committees that were looking at it.
[02:53:02.128 --> 02:53:11.259]  Well, now fast forward as the firehose information comes out and more tapes get released and more audio with Hunter admitting he was a communist Chinese agent.
[02:53:11.259 --> 02:53:12.901]  We're not trying to censor it anymore.
[02:53:12.901 --> 02:53:18.989]  Not because they're good people, but because the Streisand effect boomeranged on their traitorous butts last time.
[02:53:19.750 --> 02:53:21.011]  Just a few weeks ago.
[02:53:21.011 --> 02:53:23.892]  And so now they know they're trying to suppress it, only makes it bigger.
[02:53:23.892 --> 02:53:27.114]  Just like they've done with Infowars and Bandai Video.
[02:53:27.114 --> 02:53:27.994]  It's truly amazing.
[02:53:27.994 --> 02:53:29.475]  So keep telling the truth.
[02:53:29.475 --> 02:53:30.796]  The Lord works in mysterious ways.
[02:53:30.796 --> 02:53:39.700]  Amazing things are happening and these communist Chinese agents are going to pay.
[02:53:39.700 --> 02:53:42.342]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:53:49.164 --> 02:53:52.345]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[02:53:52.345 --> 02:53:57.306]  We've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there.
[02:53:57.306 --> 02:54:00.287]  I'm eastbound, just one more damn good run.
[02:54:00.287 --> 02:54:02.908]  Give me liberty, or give me death.
[02:54:02.908 --> 02:54:04.689]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:54:04.689 --> 02:54:08.330]  Let it all hang out, cause we gotta run today.
[02:54:08.330 --> 02:54:13.251]  The boys are thirsty in Atlanta, and there's beer in Texarkana, and we'll bring it back.
[02:54:18.740 --> 02:54:28.166]  Robert Barnes is our guest in one of your phone calls next segment in T9's 6 Minutes.
[02:54:28.166 --> 02:54:31.248]  But I wanted to ask him about the Hunter Biden stuff.
[02:54:31.248 --> 02:54:32.249]  They're confirmed it's real.
[02:54:32.249 --> 02:54:34.330]  The media keeps trying to just ignore it.
[02:54:34.330 --> 02:54:36.512]  All this Chinese spying evidence coming out.
[02:54:36.512 --> 02:54:43.717]  Even if Biden got in, I don't see how they ever get away with what they've done other than a total police state, which I guess the Democrats say they're going to carry out.
[02:54:45.234 --> 02:54:48.915]  We've absolutely got to defeat Biden.
[02:54:48.915 --> 02:54:49.996]  What are other angles?
[02:54:49.996 --> 02:54:54.257]  What's your view on the Hunter Biden situation and all that that's coming out?
[02:54:54.257 --> 02:54:58.239]  What's extraordinary is the FBI had this for a year and sat on it and buried it.
[02:54:58.239 --> 02:55:05.902]  And so it's incredible, the scope, the scale, the depth, the duration of the corruption, the fact that Durham has not taken meaningful action.
[02:55:05.902 --> 02:55:08.883]  I think that after the election, Trump needs to step up and
[02:55:10.393 --> 02:55:13.695]  Basically resuscitate aspects of our American democratic institutions.
[02:55:13.695 --> 02:55:18.137]  And the first way you can do that is to pardon both Snowden and Assange.
[02:55:18.137 --> 02:55:27.322]  You need to send a message to the deep state that their ongoing corruption and collusion and covering up the Biden scandal, not taking action related to Spygate, has to have a consequence.
[02:55:27.322 --> 02:55:35.666]  And the best way for it to have a consequence is to pardon the two people they hate almost as much or even more than the president, Julian Assange and Ed Snowden.
[02:55:35.666 --> 02:55:40.048]  And these have been two critical whistleblowers that have been a check on the corruption of the deep state.
[02:55:40.461 --> 02:55:42.262]  And we need to unleash their power again.
[02:55:42.262 --> 02:55:49.326]  We need to re-empower WikiLeaks, re-empower Snowden, to be able to continue to be important whistleblowers against the institutionalized power.
[02:55:49.326 --> 02:55:50.006]  I totally agree.
[02:55:50.006 --> 02:55:52.147]  Isn't that Trump's biggest failing?
[02:55:52.147 --> 02:55:55.469]  That he didn't pardon Assange and greenlight others?
[02:55:55.469 --> 02:55:58.931]  He told Assange, whoever's got the intel, give it out, release it.
[02:55:58.931 --> 02:55:59.371]  He did it.
[02:55:59.371 --> 02:56:01.693]  I think that's a big strike against Trump.
[02:56:01.693 --> 02:56:03.814]  Why hasn't he done the right thing?
[02:56:03.814 --> 02:56:09.397]  I think a lot of people convinced him that if he reached a detente with the deep state, that Durham would clean up the bad actors and everything would be great.
[02:56:10.547 --> 02:56:31.557]  I mean, for example, imagine if Julian Assange was sitting in the Ecuadorian embassy, he likely would have got this Hunter Biden information six months ago, and it would have gone public a long time ago and in a more effective delivery mechanism than people like Steve Bannon and Rudy Giuliani.
[02:56:31.557 --> 02:56:34.998]  Assange would have been a much more effective means to get this truth out about the world.
[02:56:34.998 --> 02:56:38.380]  Yeah, if you just put it up on a website for everybody, you don't like send it to only certain media.
[02:56:39.585 --> 02:56:44.467]  Exactly, and you don't do it in this sort of half-assed way that sounds, that looks selective and looks partisan.
[02:56:44.467 --> 02:56:52.171]  You let someone that has a long established record of never, like, they're able to challenge the verification and authentication of these things because it's not Assange.
[02:56:52.171 --> 02:56:55.332]  Assange, everything he's put out has always been validated and verified.
[02:56:55.332 --> 02:56:56.333]  None of it has ever been wrong.
[02:56:56.778 --> 02:57:04.441]  So the they removed Assange to help facilitate the corruption of this election, protect the corruption of the Biden and undermine Trump.
[02:57:04.441 --> 02:57:08.522]  I think he's starting to recognize and realize that full scope of scale now.
[02:57:08.522 --> 02:57:12.764]  So hopefully he'll take remedial action after the election, because if Assange was not under indictment.
[02:57:13.123 --> 02:57:17.766]  The Hunter Biden corruption and other Biden related corruption would have already been fully exposed.
[02:57:17.766 --> 02:57:18.186]  I agree.
[02:57:18.186 --> 02:57:19.647]  And I know folks that know Giuliani.
[02:57:19.647 --> 02:57:21.008]  He doesn't know how to run a website.
[02:57:21.008 --> 02:57:22.389]  He doesn't know how to do any of this.
[02:57:22.389 --> 02:57:23.950]  So it's not that Giuliani's even bad.
[02:57:23.950 --> 02:57:25.992]  He just, he just doesn't know what he's doing.
[02:57:25.992 --> 02:57:29.594]  And no one's willing to, I'm not willing, I'm not going to publish all this child porn.
[02:57:29.594 --> 02:57:30.715]  I've talked to folks that have seen it.
[02:57:30.715 --> 02:57:31.676]  It's confirmed.
[02:57:31.676 --> 02:57:33.477]  It's Hunter screwing little kids, man.
[02:57:33.477 --> 02:57:35.038]  But that's a crime to even put it out.
[02:57:35.038 --> 02:57:37.980]  And the FBI won't prosecute the guy that did it.
[02:57:37.980 --> 02:57:38.840]  They'll prosecute me.
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:39.501]  You know, they would, Bob.
[02:57:40.757 --> 02:57:41.579]  Oh, no doubt about it.
[02:57:41.579 --> 02:57:43.102]  The hypocrisy is hot.
[02:57:43.102 --> 02:57:46.308]  I mean, the problem is Rudy Giuliani is a poor man's Julian Assange.
[02:57:46.647 --> 02:57:48.948]  Steve Bannon is a poor man's Alex Jones.
[02:57:48.948 --> 02:57:51.068]  It's not the effective way to get this story out.
[02:57:51.068 --> 02:57:55.150]  And so, it could have been far more effective if Assange had been free.
[02:57:55.150 --> 02:57:58.891]  And in order to free democracy, the President needs to free Assange.
[02:57:58.891 --> 02:58:01.351]  But Bob, I know you've probably already been offered it.
[02:58:01.351 --> 02:58:01.912]  I bet you have.
[02:58:01.912 --> 02:58:04.572]  I mean, I've been offered the laptop by high-level folks in U.S.
[02:58:04.572 --> 02:58:06.173]  intelligence who I know are real.
[02:58:06.173 --> 02:58:09.134]  Do you want to go through 50,000 of these, 25,000 things?
[02:58:09.134 --> 02:58:10.534]  I mean, do you want to do that?
[02:58:10.534 --> 02:58:12.715]  I think you probably don't want that job, do you?
[02:58:13.683 --> 02:58:14.103]  No, exactly.
[02:58:14.103 --> 02:58:16.305]  That's where Assange and WikiLeaks were perfect for this.
[02:58:16.305 --> 02:58:19.067]  They have done this multiple times over the decades.
[02:58:19.067 --> 02:58:24.912]  They are the best-skilled, best-equipped people to screen through it quickly, filter it effectively, verify it authentically.
[02:58:24.912 --> 02:58:25.212]  I agree.
[02:58:25.212 --> 02:58:26.453]  Let's come back and talk about it.
[02:58:26.453 --> 02:58:27.954]  Robert Barnes is our guest.
[02:58:27.954 --> 02:58:28.715]  He's on fire.
[02:58:28.715 --> 02:58:30.436]  Check out his Twitter when we come back.
[02:58:30.436 --> 02:58:35.881]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Tomorrow's News, today, today, today, today.
[02:58:35.881 --> 02:58:38.203]  Spread the links now or bow to the new award.
[02:58:44.206 --> 02:58:51.008]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired and even worshipped for thousands of years by ancient civilizations.
[02:58:51.008 --> 02:58:54.949]  But with modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular.
[02:58:54.949 --> 02:59:01.952]  Its antioxidant effect, its anti-inflammatory effect, everything it does is simply amazing.
[02:59:01.952 --> 02:59:05.993]  And most turmerics out there are simply food products.
[02:59:05.993 --> 02:59:11.535]  They're 3-5% curcuminoid, but we have body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[02:59:12.455 --> 02:59:12.555]  Yeah.
[02:59:34.145 --> 02:59:38.107]  He's hot on your trail, and he ain't gonna rest until you're in jail.
[02:59:38.107 --> 02:59:41.549]  So you've got to dodge him, you've got to duck him, you've got to keep that piece of truck in.
[03:00:08.625 --> 03:00:31.042]  There you have a big Trump parade in Israel.
[03:00:31.042 --> 03:00:32.383]  Trump parades in Europe.
[03:00:32.383 --> 03:00:33.824]  Trump parades in the United States.
[03:00:35.009 --> 03:00:37.651]  There was one that was like 100 miles long the other day.
[03:00:37.651 --> 03:00:39.393]  I was reading about it on the East Coast.
[03:00:39.393 --> 03:00:41.755]  Robert Barnes, Conscious Lawyer, is our guest.
[03:00:41.755 --> 03:00:45.198]  We're about to go to these loaded phone lines, get to every one of them that are holding.
[03:00:45.198 --> 03:00:47.079]  Barnes, other points about this election.
[03:00:47.079 --> 03:01:01.072]  I mean, wow, what does the left do if your predictions that were right four years ago, that Trump wins in a landslide, so big they can't even contest because all the uncounted ballots will be less in numbers than they need to go over the top when it's clear.
[03:01:01.072 --> 03:01:02.533]  What are they going to do then when they lose?
[03:01:03.817 --> 03:01:05.158]  Well, they're already previewing it.
[03:01:05.158 --> 03:01:17.851]  I mean, they're basically taking the strategy that they use in foreign countries, that the CIA types use in foreign countries, which is to create bogus polling narratives that say Trump can't win, so that if he does win, they claim he stole it somehow.
[03:01:17.851 --> 03:01:23.296]  And you already have people like Nate Silver, the FiveThirtyEight, the big political forecaster, saying exactly that.
[03:01:23.806 --> 03:01:40.831]  So they're trying to set up a narrative in advance of trying to discredit Trump's election, discredit democracy, discredit the American working class that's going to put him back in power, particularly in small town America, across the country that's turning out at record levels, trying to discredit them by claiming they really didn't vote for who they voted for.
[03:01:40.831 --> 03:01:51.075]  And the only question is what storyline and narrative and what culprit they're going to blame it on, unless they're not going to try to go back to the Russiagate narrative time, you know, the sequel or the third trilogy.
[03:01:52.765 --> 03:01:53.546]  I totally agree with you.
[03:01:53.546 --> 03:01:58.651]  So why don't we get arrogant statements by Pelosi that regardless of what happens in the election, this is a quote, Joe Biden will be inaugurated the 20th.
[03:01:58.651 --> 03:01:59.792]  What the hell does that mean?
[03:02:16.195 --> 03:02:17.156]  I mean, that's what's right.
[03:02:17.156 --> 03:02:24.360]  I mean, I think that, you know, they need to win a majority of House seats to try to invalidate the election, so that there's a majority of House delegation.
[03:02:24.360 --> 03:02:27.682]  They already have enough House seats, but right now they don't control enough states.
[03:02:27.682 --> 03:02:28.223]  Absolutely.
[03:02:28.223 --> 03:02:31.265]  So do they gain seats in the House according to your number crunching?
[03:02:31.265 --> 03:02:32.646]  Do they get control of the Senate?
[03:02:32.646 --> 03:02:33.426]  Let's look at Congress.
[03:02:33.426 --> 03:02:35.107]  What's your view on that?
[03:02:35.107 --> 03:02:35.968]  I don't think they will.
[03:02:35.968 --> 03:02:40.731]  I don't think they don't have enough control in enough states, and they don't have enough good candidates in enough states.
[03:02:41.092 --> 03:02:45.916]  So I think Republicans will still continue to control the majority of delegations in the House.
[03:02:45.916 --> 03:02:47.997]  So that will be the check for Trump.
[03:02:47.997 --> 03:02:48.578]  We'll see.
[03:02:48.578 --> 03:02:52.441]  You know, as we talked about, Barrett was not a trustworthy vote.
[03:02:52.441 --> 03:02:57.465]  And everybody said that she was going to get on there and she was going to stop all this nonsense in Pennsylvania and other people.
[03:02:57.465 --> 03:02:58.205]  And what did she do?
[03:02:58.205 --> 03:03:00.187]  She ran for cover and didn't even vote.
[03:03:00.187 --> 03:03:03.029]  So he can't trust the Supreme Court, unfortunately.
[03:03:03.029 --> 03:03:04.070]  Well, that's a good point.
[03:03:04.070 --> 03:03:07.292]  She just basically went along with all this in her first vote.
[03:03:07.292 --> 03:03:07.833]  Didn't even vote.
[03:03:09.486 --> 03:03:16.250]  The whole purpose to rush her was the people told Trump, put her on the bench and she'll make sure none of these crazy things happen in these elections.
[03:03:16.250 --> 03:03:19.432]  And she gets a chance right away in Pennsylvania, North Carolina.
[03:03:19.432 --> 03:03:26.917]  The vote happened, they waited deliberately until after she was confirmed so that she had an opportunity to vote and she skipped voting.
[03:03:26.917 --> 03:03:29.618]  Said that she doesn't feel comfortable voting right now.
[03:03:29.618 --> 03:03:34.141]  So that tells you how unreliable, Trump's power comes from the people.
[03:03:34.565 --> 03:03:42.309]  And so as long as the people's voice is heard, their willingness to override that, their willingness to completely ignore that, is limited.
[03:03:42.309 --> 03:03:46.471]  So that's where his only real power base is, is the base of the popular support that he has.
[03:03:46.471 --> 03:03:50.173]  Sure, I want to leave the door open for her, but I trust you, you've really been proven accurate.
[03:03:50.173 --> 03:03:51.673]  That scares the hell out of me.
[03:03:51.673 --> 03:03:52.614]  Gosh.
[03:03:52.614 --> 03:03:53.514]  Alright, let's take calls.
[03:03:53.514 --> 03:03:55.075]  Mohammed in Florida, thanks for holding.
[03:03:55.075 --> 03:03:56.896]  You're on the air with Robert Barnes, welcome sir.
[03:04:00.580 --> 03:04:06.885]  The first rule of a foreign invasion is to grab control of the media and the communications.
[03:04:06.885 --> 03:04:17.674]  I remember in Russia, Boris Yeltsin, when he took over, when he was trying to fight against the USSR, the bloodiest battles that occurred were in the newsrooms, in the media.
[03:04:17.674 --> 03:04:20.116]  So, this is where the battle is.
[03:04:20.116 --> 03:04:26.521]  I mean, the Chinese have bought the media, they control the media, they control big tech, they are
[03:04:27.216 --> 03:04:31.997]  In the big tech headquarters actually controlling the tech, controlling the algorithms.
[03:04:31.997 --> 03:04:32.618]  No, you're right.
[03:04:32.618 --> 03:04:33.638]  It's big news.
[03:04:33.638 --> 03:04:35.038]  Big news controls big tech.
[03:04:35.038 --> 03:04:36.639]  You're right.
[03:04:36.639 --> 03:04:37.199]  Correct.
[03:04:37.199 --> 03:04:39.360]  So Trump needs to make this his priority.
[03:04:39.360 --> 03:04:41.600]  He needs to round up Jack Dorsey.
[03:04:41.600 --> 03:04:45.101]  He needs to round up Zuckerberg Facebook.
[03:04:45.101 --> 03:04:47.782]  He needs to go after Jeff Zucker, CNN.
[03:04:47.782 --> 03:04:50.423]  These people have been colluding
[03:04:51.144 --> 03:04:54.206]  With a foreign power to take over the United States.
[03:04:54.206 --> 03:04:56.687]  And I'm not just saying that, it's a fact.
[03:04:56.687 --> 03:05:01.971]  When you go on Twitter and you can put Chinese propaganda, that's not taken down.
[03:05:01.971 --> 03:05:08.995]  But when you put something about the United States, about the President, when the President's headquarters are shut down, that's foreign collusion.
[03:05:08.995 --> 03:05:16.760]  When you go on YouTube and you can say, China is evil, and they won't let that comment stay, but you can put America is evil, and that comment will stay.
[03:05:17.344 --> 03:05:19.205]  That's colluding with a foreign power.
[03:05:19.205 --> 03:05:25.869]  He has that capability, based on that, to charge him with treason, to charge him with sedition.
[03:05:25.869 --> 03:05:29.932]  And if they're guilty, they need to be executed immediately, to set an example.
[03:05:29.932 --> 03:05:32.294]  The biggest battle here is in the newsroom.
[03:05:32.294 --> 03:05:33.854]  It's in the media.
[03:05:33.854 --> 03:05:35.616]  I mean, we could do anything we want to do.
[03:05:35.616 --> 03:05:37.097]  We could win the election by land.
[03:05:37.097 --> 03:05:42.020]  It won't matter, because the media is going to report what the Chinese want the media to report.
[03:05:42.020 --> 03:05:43.461]  That's the biggest battle.
[03:05:43.461 --> 03:05:44.221]  This is not a
[03:05:46.093 --> 03:05:47.015]  That's right.
[03:05:54.611 --> 03:05:59.615]  Throughout history, we fought these kind of wars to prevent this type of takeover.
[03:05:59.615 --> 03:06:02.137]  Well, I agree with you that I'm not in command of any violence.
[03:06:02.137 --> 03:06:02.978]  I don't want violence.
[03:06:02.978 --> 03:06:14.547]  But we're coming into an area where if they're involved in criminal activity and refuse to follow elections, we enter a wheelhouse where it's always been finally blood that gets the checks signed.
[03:06:14.547 --> 03:06:15.668]  I appreciate your call, Mohammed.
[03:06:15.668 --> 03:06:16.529]  Very powerful points.
[03:06:16.529 --> 03:06:17.590]  Please call back again.
[03:06:17.590 --> 03:06:18.510]  Thanks for holding.
[03:06:18.510 --> 03:06:19.031]  Robert Barnes?
[03:06:20.523 --> 03:06:22.405]  Well, I mean, we're seeing what the system wants.
[03:06:22.405 --> 03:06:26.909]  They want to weaponize their own mob while preventing people from being able to defend themselves.
[03:06:26.909 --> 03:06:37.559]  That's why they're not allowing self-defense to be... That's why they're criminally prosecuting people who defended themselves, like Rittenhouse, like the McCloskeys, like Michael Strickland out of Portland.
[03:06:37.559 --> 03:06:45.446]  In all these cases, while weaponizing the mob and not letting either the police or the public protect themselves from the mob, when it's a leftist mob committing violence.
[03:06:45.965 --> 03:06:47.226]  And I think that's part of it.
[03:06:47.226 --> 03:06:50.847]  They're anticipating in advance the different ways people could resist.
[03:06:50.847 --> 03:06:55.690]  Well, they're encouraging the mob to go out and attack, saying, you've got to get out of jail free card.
[03:06:55.690 --> 03:06:56.190]  Exactly.
[03:06:56.190 --> 03:07:03.453]  They want to control the mob and prevent self-defense and even prevent local police from defending themselves or defending their community.
[03:07:03.453 --> 03:07:04.894]  So that's the goal is to seize.
[03:07:04.894 --> 03:07:07.235]  I'm a cop and somebody's trying to stab me.
[03:07:07.235 --> 03:07:08.495]  Doesn't matter I'm a cop or not.
[03:07:08.495 --> 03:07:09.316]  I'm going to defend myself.
[03:07:09.316 --> 03:07:10.656]  I have a right to defend myself.
[03:07:10.656 --> 03:07:13.838]  I've seen videos where cops let people beat them over the head with baseball bats.
[03:07:14.778 --> 03:07:20.283]  Yeah, they become terrified and they become, it was the whole reason why they went after the Proud Boys originally in New York.
[03:07:20.283 --> 03:07:24.106]  It was to discourage and deter people from defending themselves from the mob.
[03:07:24.106 --> 03:07:28.450]  And the cops saw that, they're like, wait, you get attacked by people and you can't defend yourself?
[03:07:28.450 --> 03:07:29.010]  Exactly.
[03:07:29.010 --> 03:07:37.758]  And if you do, all of a sudden you're going to be demonized in the press, you're going to be attacked, you're going to be criminally prosecuted if you're just the, if you just show people a gun like the McCloskey.
[03:07:38.308 --> 03:07:43.971]  So the, or if you defend yourself from people trying to seize your gun and hit you in the head, like Rittenhouse.
[03:07:43.971 --> 03:07:44.412]  Powerful.
[03:07:44.412 --> 03:07:45.132]  Let's go to D.C.
[03:07:45.132 --> 03:07:45.572]  and Nevada.
[03:07:45.572 --> 03:07:45.852]  D.C.
[03:07:45.852 --> 03:07:46.133]  and Nevada.
[03:07:46.133 --> 03:07:47.033]  You're on the air with Robert Barnes.
[03:07:47.033 --> 03:07:48.254]  Go ahead.
[03:07:48.254 --> 03:07:49.315]  Yes.
[03:07:49.315 --> 03:07:49.575]  Yes, sir.
[03:07:49.575 --> 03:07:50.155]  You there?
[03:07:50.155 --> 03:07:51.396]  Yes, sir.
[03:07:51.396 --> 03:07:52.917]  Okay.
[03:07:52.917 --> 03:08:06.865]  Alex, man, if the whole WHOREs of the world that is ignorant, that need to stand down, and they need to fear that the vision
[03:08:08.101 --> 03:08:11.162]  of violence is through their neglect.
[03:08:11.162 --> 03:08:12.562]  That's number one.
[03:08:12.562 --> 03:08:27.767]  Number two, Pelosi, Obama, or should I say Michelle Obama, which are the baby mamas, Clinton, are the baby mamas of the scarlet of the world.
[03:08:27.767 --> 03:08:33.909]  They do not want law to happen because they are the scarlet women of the world.
[03:08:33.909 --> 03:08:36.530]  But Jesus said he's living life
[03:08:37.245 --> 03:08:38.885]  And the life of word is Jesus.
[03:08:38.885 --> 03:08:43.646]  I'm going to give you one other thing, man, that's going to blow your mind.
[03:08:43.646 --> 03:08:53.788]  You have the assignment and the consignment to control whatever it takes for what is sitting on the scarlet letter.
[03:08:53.788 --> 03:09:04.250]  These people are sitting on the scarlet letter, and this scarlet letter is the women who are over women bodies.
[03:09:04.250 --> 03:09:05.030]  And they're conscious.
[03:09:05.854 --> 03:09:17.159]  This is what they are missing, and they know that Satan had given them that particular fear and violence and ignorance to control the women's body.
[03:09:17.159 --> 03:09:23.201]  But let me give you one other thing, Alex, before I let you go and you start talking to me.
[03:09:23.201 --> 03:09:26.102]  David and Goliath, it was a rock.
[03:09:26.102 --> 03:09:28.824]  Man, go ahead and throw that rock.
[03:09:28.824 --> 03:09:29.644]  Okay, I got you.
[03:09:33.359 --> 03:09:36.467]  Brother, very interesting poetry, and I know there's some meaning to that.
[03:09:36.467 --> 03:09:38.051]  I'll listen to it after the show.
[03:09:38.051 --> 03:09:38.793]  Thank you so much.
[03:09:38.793 --> 03:09:40.577]  We'll cover it and take more calls straight ahead.
[03:09:42.697 --> 03:09:47.861]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when it comes to the show?
[03:09:47.861 --> 03:10:05.456]  And it's the fact that Infowars, more than 25 years ago, doing basic research with what the Club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying, developed the hypothesis that communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[03:10:05.456 --> 03:10:06.717]  Well, now China owns the debt.
[03:10:06.717 --> 03:10:09.480]  Now China owns Hollywood, all the one-sided trading deals.
[03:10:10.200 --> 03:10:14.842]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on, but again, it wasn't that hard.
[03:10:14.842 --> 03:10:20.464]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still, others didn't want to focus on that issue.
[03:10:20.464 --> 03:10:24.986]  We did, and you focused on it by supporting us at InfoWars.
[03:10:24.986 --> 03:10:36.031]  So when you go to InfoWarsStore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts, films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world of what's really happening.
[03:10:36.031 --> 03:10:37.831]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[03:10:37.831 --> 03:10:38.872]  I want to thank you for your support.
[03:10:42.281 --> 03:10:57.424]  Election 2020 is here, and whether Trump wins or loses, we have all won by exposing the Communist Chinese, by exposing the globalists, by exposing the pedophile rings, by exposing the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil.
[03:10:57.424 --> 03:11:01.984]  Now I'm personally a Christian and I believe in God, and I know God's real and I've experienced it in my life.
[03:11:01.984 --> 03:11:07.265]  But even if you don't believe in God, it's important to recognize that there is good in this world, there is evil.
[03:11:07.265 --> 03:11:10.506]  And there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy doing bad.
[03:11:11.466 --> 03:11:21.330]  And what I see happening across the spectrum of different political views is people finally get that they finally understand that they're not being naive anymore.
[03:11:21.330 --> 03:11:27.032]  Don't ever project your decency and your goodness onto other people until they've proven or
[03:11:27.312 --> 03:11:29.314]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:11:53.143 --> 03:11:55.505]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:11:55.505 --> 03:12:01.351]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show on a fly like an eagle to the sea.
[03:12:16.716 --> 03:12:28.907]  Long before your soul's gone down the river, and your body dies at sea, your spirit's already flown on over the mountains, the seas, the grey havens, into the future.
[03:12:28.907 --> 03:12:30.508]  Fly like an eagle.
[03:12:30.508 --> 03:12:32.390]  I'm gonna fly like an eagle.
[03:12:49.964 --> 03:12:52.545]  Let your spirit carry me.
[03:12:52.545 --> 03:12:57.345]  Robert Barnes, find him on Twitter and at his great website, barneslawllp.com.
[03:12:57.345 --> 03:13:01.866]  Hey, I want to hit a few falls here, but let us in on a big secret.
[03:13:01.866 --> 03:13:09.168]  I know you can't give us everything, but you're getting ready with a big heavy hitter who's exposing the vaccine damage and the vaccine fraud.
[03:13:09.168 --> 03:13:15.669]  Doesn't mean we're against vaccine technology, doesn't mean we're against science, but the vaccine dangers, the bad effects that they've been covering up, they're now admitted.
[03:13:16.249 --> 03:13:20.813]  You know, they attacked Joe Rogan and said, Jones is lying that 80% got sick in a Bill Gates study.
[03:13:20.813 --> 03:13:25.236]  Or at least Bill Gates saying it himself on CBS News.
[03:13:25.236 --> 03:13:26.157]  This is big.
[03:13:26.157 --> 03:13:30.641]  I mean, the whole new frontier is them Congress passes a law saying they have liability protection.
[03:13:30.641 --> 03:13:32.822]  They really don't, do they, Bob?
[03:13:32.822 --> 03:13:33.403]  No doubt about it.
[03:13:33.403 --> 03:13:34.364]  I mean, they should be.
[03:13:34.364 --> 03:13:38.267]  Basically, what happened is the political class created a label of a drug.
[03:13:38.900 --> 03:13:39.240]  I'm good to go.
[03:14:00.606 --> 03:14:01.366]  We're good to go.
[03:14:16.380 --> 03:14:26.603]  Uh, requires that we treat any drug with the same skepticism and scrutiny that every drug should look at, regardless of whether the drug is called a vaccine or not.
[03:14:26.603 --> 03:14:29.564]  And all the censorship of consumer reviews now.
[03:14:29.564 --> 03:14:35.746]  They're trying to say a mother whose child has a seizure after it can't complain on Facebook because she's not a doctor.
[03:14:35.746 --> 03:14:39.928]  Since when can we not complain that we took a drug or had a surgery and it sucked?
[03:14:39.928 --> 03:14:41.028]  I mean, this is crazy.
[03:14:42.389 --> 03:14:49.133]  No, and there's a long history of governments abusing their power over medicine to control populations.
[03:14:49.133 --> 03:14:52.755]  Well, I mean, didn't medical tyranny start here in Nazi Germany?
[03:14:52.755 --> 03:14:55.556]  I mean, didn't tyranny start in the medical system?
[03:14:55.556 --> 03:14:56.537]  Absolutely, no doubt about it.
[03:14:56.537 --> 03:15:05.501]  I mean, the power of the white lab coat to try to control and dictate people's thoughts, minds, and behavior has a long history, so much so that they study it, like in the Milgram experiment.
[03:15:05.501 --> 03:15:12.045]  And, I mean, we try to get rid of Native American populations by the name of medicine sending them tuberculosis-infected blankets.
[03:15:12.438 --> 03:15:14.519]  So this has a long, notorious history.
[03:15:14.519 --> 03:15:25.727]  In the name of, hey, we're here to protect you, they sterilized a whole bunch of poor women throughout the South for 30 years, denying them and depriving them of the ability to have children and have a future and have a legacy.
[03:15:25.727 --> 03:15:27.428]  So we cannot trust.
[03:15:27.428 --> 03:15:33.853]  There's a long history of not being able to trust the state when it comes to saying, don't worry, we're doing this for your public health.
[03:15:34.304 --> 03:15:35.684]  That's not enough.
[03:15:35.684 --> 03:15:40.005]  We should have the same scrutiny, the same skepticism, the same standards.
[03:15:40.005 --> 03:15:49.747]  We apply it to any drug, we should apply it to vaccines, and we should have the same constitutional rights and legal remedies that we have as it applies to any government action.
[03:15:49.747 --> 03:15:57.169]  The fact that it's done in the name of the public health does not magically inoculate it from constitutional scrutiny and civil liberty.
[03:15:58.564 --> 03:16:06.051]  And again, for folks that don't know, there's the Stanford research one, the prison experiment, and there's the Milgram experiment on shocking people to death.
[03:16:06.051 --> 03:16:07.993]  Explain to people briefly the history of that.
[03:16:07.993 --> 03:16:09.474]  It's very important.
[03:16:09.474 --> 03:16:09.835]  Exactly.
[03:16:09.835 --> 03:16:13.398]  The question was, could you bring people in and get them to shock a complete stranger?
[03:16:13.789 --> 03:16:14.129]  We're good to go.
[03:16:33.621 --> 03:16:35.162]  Well, they actually believed at the end they were killing people.
[03:16:35.162 --> 03:16:36.603]  They found the majority would kill someone.
[03:16:59.073 --> 03:16:59.893]  That's exactly right.
[03:16:59.893 --> 03:17:04.074]  And they would even ask, you know, some people would get worried and say, will I be held liable?
[03:17:04.074 --> 03:17:05.074]  They'd be like, no, don't worry.
[03:17:05.074 --> 03:17:06.534]  Just keep doing it.
[03:17:06.534 --> 03:17:07.375]  Keep doing what you're told.
[03:17:07.375 --> 03:17:09.095]  So let's explain the extrapolation.
[03:17:09.095 --> 03:17:12.495]  We didn't have a system then as corrupt that would break the social contract.
[03:17:12.495 --> 03:17:16.176]  At least they'd try this at secret laboratories, but not in a mass scale.
[03:17:16.176 --> 03:17:26.378]  We're seeing beta tests like the Milgram experiment and Stanford now externalized, going operational globally by the UN, Bill Gates and others for a total societal takeover.
[03:17:26.778 --> 03:17:34.740]  Calling all other deaths COVID, exaggerating it, ordering forced inoculations, telling us we're non-essential, starving the third world.
[03:17:34.740 --> 03:17:36.080]  I mean, this is their big move.
[03:17:36.080 --> 03:17:41.621]  If you ever wanted to see it, the worldwide eugenics depopulation move, this is it.
[03:17:41.621 --> 03:17:42.021]  Exactly.
[03:17:42.021 --> 03:17:50.543]  I mean, it's amazing how this virus has a disparate effect, both in its direct and indirect effect on the kind of populations Bill Gates doesn't like.
[03:17:51.035 --> 03:17:53.316]  So, Bill Gates has been for death panels.
[03:17:53.316 --> 03:17:55.057]  It disproportionately affects the elderly.
[03:17:55.057 --> 03:17:59.059]  Bill Gates is for racial control of lower populations from Africa.
[03:17:59.059 --> 03:18:04.042]  It disproportionately affects African Americans and is starving poor people in Africa and Latin America.
[03:18:04.042 --> 03:18:10.445]  So, it reflects not only his agenda, but sort of a broader deep state agenda of seeing how much social control they can have.
[03:18:10.445 --> 03:18:15.628]  I mean, when you have someone like Governor of California saying that you can't even get together for Thanksgiving,
[03:18:16.061 --> 03:18:22.727]  Without certain limits, you can't even sing Christian hymns together for your own family at Thanksgiving.
[03:18:22.727 --> 03:18:26.771]  But Black Lives Matter is good, it can burn your city down.
[03:18:26.771 --> 03:18:32.156]  It's such an obvious see what you'll put up with, because he has no consequences, so we never hold him accountable.
[03:18:32.156 --> 03:18:41.245]  How do we hold Governor Newsom, that monster, and Governor of Michigan, Whitmer, how do we hold these monsters accountable?
[03:18:42.028 --> 03:18:43.990]  The first is to re-elect Donald Trump.
[03:18:43.990 --> 03:18:47.393]  Re-electing Donald Trump creates the window of opportunity to hold him accountable.
[03:18:47.393 --> 03:18:50.396]  The second thing is... A lot of folks are mad at him pushing a vaccine.
[03:18:50.396 --> 03:18:52.397]  He did that to take control of Gates, clearly.
[03:18:52.397 --> 03:18:53.118]  Gates is pissed.
[03:18:53.118 --> 03:18:54.279]  Oh, don't take his.
[03:18:54.279 --> 03:18:55.881]  Wait two years and take mine.
[03:18:55.881 --> 03:18:56.361]  Exactly.
[03:18:56.361 --> 03:19:01.005]  Trump has been not wearing a mask, saying he's over it, saying don't give in to fear.
[03:19:01.005 --> 03:19:01.566]  Exactly.
[03:19:01.566 --> 03:19:04.108]  And also Trump has said he will not force it, period.
[03:19:04.108 --> 03:19:06.070]  That he opposes a forced vaccine.
[03:19:06.070 --> 03:19:08.512]  So it's simply an option, an alternative for people to have.
[03:19:09.039 --> 03:19:11.000]  And that's the way vaccines should be.
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:12.941]  They should be a drug with informed consent.
[03:19:12.941 --> 03:19:15.303]  You can say yes, you can say no.
[03:19:15.303 --> 03:19:20.025]  And it should be the same standard, same scrutiny as anything else constitutionally and legally.
[03:19:20.025 --> 03:19:23.807]  And the only way that's going to happen is if Donald Trump is re-elected president.
[03:19:23.807 --> 03:19:33.953]  He'll also send a message to all the lockdown politicians and all the forced vaccine politicians that their agenda is nowhere near as popular as they thought it is if Donald Trump is re-elected.
[03:19:33.953 --> 03:19:36.054]  Alright Barnes, how do folks follow you on Twitter, my friend?
[03:19:36.840 --> 03:19:39.622]  Sure, at Barnes underscore Law.
[03:19:39.622 --> 03:19:43.684]  They haven't censored me yet, so I'm still up there and people can follow me there.
[03:19:43.684 --> 03:19:44.625]  Well, they're a little scared of you.
[03:19:44.625 --> 03:19:48.227]  You're going to join us a couple times on Tuesday night during the election.
[03:19:48.227 --> 03:19:51.028]  I think like 6 o'clock, 9 o'clock, and 11 o'clock or so.
[03:19:51.028 --> 03:19:52.709]  You think he's going to win handily.
[03:19:52.709 --> 03:19:53.970]  I hope you're right.
[03:19:53.970 --> 03:19:56.592]  I think you're right, but we're going to certainly see what happens.
[03:19:56.592 --> 03:19:59.453]  We'll talk to you on election night, my friend.
[03:19:59.453 --> 03:19:59.893]  Absolutely.
[03:19:59.893 --> 03:20:00.574]  Happy to be on, Alex.
[03:20:01.647 --> 03:20:02.768]  All right, sorry to the other callers.
[03:20:02.768 --> 03:20:03.709]  I got to a lot of callers today.
[03:20:03.709 --> 03:20:04.629]  I'm out of time.
[03:20:04.629 --> 03:20:11.255]  Dr. Nick Begich, a trailblazer exposing evil, is about to take over two segments of the Owen Schroer, The War Room, then Election Countdown tonight.
[03:20:11.255 --> 03:20:14.017]  Deanna Lorraine, Owen Schroer, Harrison Smith, and others.
[03:20:14.017 --> 03:20:16.299]  7 to 9 only way dog hunts.
[03:20:16.299 --> 03:20:17.680]  You let dog out of cage.
[03:20:17.680 --> 03:20:18.561]  I know you will.
[03:20:18.561 --> 03:20:19.621]  Spread the live links.
[03:20:19.621 --> 03:20:27.348]  Man.video and the new site that they're not able to block as much, that isn't as censored as much, is also listed on the website.
[03:20:27.968 --> 03:20:30.110]  And it is... I forget the name of it.
[03:20:30.110 --> 03:20:30.810]  There it is!
[03:20:30.810 --> 03:20:33.132]  ElectionNight.News!
[03:20:33.132 --> 03:20:35.373]  ElectionNight.News!
[03:20:35.373 --> 03:20:37.254]  ElectionNight.News!
[03:20:37.254 --> 03:20:40.416]  ElectionNight.News!
[03:20:40.416 --> 03:20:47.000]  The problem with Social Darwinism is the so-called elites, the most cunning, smart inventive people,
[03:20:48.277 --> 03:20:51.218]  ...believe that chivalry doesn't exist anymore.
[03:20:51.218 --> 03:20:56.099]  They don't believe in being aristocrats, trying to hold up civilization and empower the people.
[03:20:56.099 --> 03:21:00.720]  And once the establishment has that predatory idea, civilization collapses very, very quickly.
[03:21:00.720 --> 03:21:05.961]  You can't treat the least of us like garbage and not treat your own family like that.
[03:21:05.961 --> 03:21:08.402]  And so it is this lack of empathy that's going to destroy us.
[03:21:09.751 --> 03:21:19.397]  The globalists can try to be heartless devil worshippers that commit rituals of all sorts of horrible crimes, try to get away from the humanity, but really, they can't escape the laws of the universe.
[03:21:19.397 --> 03:21:24.161]  They may train themselves to commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves, but...
[03:21:25.001 --> 03:21:30.528]  The repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and the very structure itself.
[03:21:30.528 --> 03:21:32.670]  Wealth is created by loving God.
[03:21:32.670 --> 03:21:34.873]  Wealth is created by having a connection to God.
[03:21:34.873 --> 03:21:37.936]  God is the source of all creation, all success, all power.
[03:21:37.936 --> 03:21:39.598]  If you deny that, you'll be destroyed.
[03:21:40.479 --> 03:21:44.762]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed.
[03:21:44.762 --> 03:21:45.963]  And why is that?
[03:21:45.963 --> 03:21:53.748]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree-like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds.
[03:21:53.748 --> 03:21:58.251]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[03:21:58.251 --> 03:21:59.532]  They didn't know why.
[03:21:59.532 --> 03:22:05.276]  Well, with modern science we know it's one of the purest, cleanest organic forms of selenium.
[03:22:05.876 --> 03:22:17.371]  We have bio-true selenium sold out for months back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com at 50% off store-bought free shipping and triple patriot points.
[03:22:17.371 --> 03:22:21.076]  Bio-true selenium at InfoWarsStore.com
[03:22:22.117 --> 03:22:26.861]  It's an amazing product, and it's even more amazing in that it funds our operation.
[03:22:26.861 --> 03:22:29.363]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it.
[03:22:29.363 --> 03:22:33.487]  It is an essential nutrient in the body that you absolutely have to have.
[03:22:33.487 --> 03:22:35.388]  It's back in stock, 50% off.
[03:22:35.388 --> 03:22:38.731]  Triple Patriot points at infowarshore.com and with free shipping.
[03:22:40.638 --> 03:22:47.083]  Much of the time on big issues and societal developments, InfoWars is many, many years ahead.
[03:22:47.083 --> 03:22:52.868]  And almost all the time we are tomorrow's news today, but there's a blind spot that InfoWars has.
[03:22:52.868 --> 03:22:55.770]  I've noticed that really informed people have this as well.
[03:22:55.770 --> 03:23:02.495]  I know a lot of you tuning in are some of the most informable out there, so I want you to be retrospective and kind of examine yourself, because that's what I do every day.
[03:23:03.456 --> 03:23:12.274]  This Hunter Byte laptop is important, but the new audio, confirmed to be him, where he admits he works under the communist Chinese spy chief?
[03:23:13.154 --> 03:23:14.334]  He should be arrested right now.
[03:23:14.334 --> 03:23:16.815]  That is so huge.
[03:23:16.815 --> 03:23:19.176]  That is hiding in plain view.
[03:23:19.176 --> 03:23:21.397]  And it's getting almost no attention.
[03:23:21.397 --> 03:23:23.818]  We have to get that information out to everybody.
[03:23:23.818 --> 03:23:25.739]  It's all posted on Infowars.com.
[03:23:25.739 --> 03:23:29.020]  It's on many other major patriotic sites.
[03:23:29.020 --> 03:23:32.901]  But we need to get it out to everybody and remember that we know all of this.
[03:23:32.901 --> 03:23:34.322]  We knew it a long time ago.
[03:23:34.322 --> 03:23:37.183]  So when it breaks now, we kind of go, okay, tell us something we didn't know.
[03:23:37.183 --> 03:23:38.704]  The point is, now it's documented.
[03:23:38.704 --> 03:23:39.424]  Now it's proven.
[03:23:43.286 --> 03:23:57.252]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:23:57.252 --> 03:24:04.134]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:24:04.134 --> 03:24:07.436]  And now, your host, Nick Vagic.
[03:24:11.812 --> 03:24:20.843]  And welcome back and happy Halloween from Dr. Nick on this Friday afternoon in most of the country.
[03:24:20.843 --> 03:24:28.814]  I'm wearing my Alex mascot today and just laughing with you a little bit.
[03:24:30.185 --> 03:24:38.487]  You know, when I think about what's going on in the world, and I was at the AIP convention, we're talking about the Deep State, and they gave me this t-shirt.
[03:24:38.487 --> 03:24:44.149]  Maybe those guys can pop up a screenshot of that shirt somewhere on there.
[03:24:44.149 --> 03:24:45.569]  Where is it?
[03:24:45.569 --> 03:24:47.049]  Anyway, you can see it.
[03:24:47.049 --> 03:24:48.050]  There it is.
[03:24:48.050 --> 03:24:50.010]  And you've got the visual image.
[03:24:50.010 --> 03:24:52.271]  And it's a snake wrapped around the U.S.
[03:24:52.271 --> 03:24:53.371]  I've got to take the mask off.
[03:24:54.585 --> 03:24:59.051]  It's a snake wrapped around the U.S.
[03:24:59.051 --> 03:25:00.573]  eating Alaska, right?
[03:25:00.573 --> 03:25:10.507]  I mean, and it's the AIP convention and it's the deep state represented by that snake and it's got its tail wrapped around the Capitol building and then it's looped around the U.S.
[03:25:10.507 --> 03:25:10.747]  and then
[03:25:12.401 --> 03:25:13.602]  Eating Alaska, right?
[03:25:13.602 --> 03:25:15.383]  The last big bite.
[03:25:15.383 --> 03:25:18.226]  And I want to talk about resources a bit.
[03:25:18.226 --> 03:25:21.788]  I want to talk about the election a bit because that's a big deal right now.
[03:25:21.788 --> 03:25:25.531]  And I want to talk about the deep state from the standpoint of regulation.
[03:25:25.531 --> 03:25:34.218]  And I kind of want to start that because this is one of the things that I think is one of the accomplishments of the Trump administration that's not highlighted very much.
[03:25:34.218 --> 03:25:35.079]  And it's something that
[03:25:35.820 --> 03:25:38.961]  Needs a deeper dive into the deep state.
[03:25:38.961 --> 03:25:43.823]  And that's regulatory agencies and the bureaucracy underneath the elected officials.
[03:25:43.823 --> 03:25:52.707]  Biggest frustration for elected officials is that right now, this week and this last several months, my eldest son, Nicholas three, has been
[03:25:53.268 --> 03:25:53.508]  Yes.
[03:26:09.014 --> 03:26:24.222]  Set up all these regulations that have nothing to do with the intent of the law and then Congress and the courts have to unravel them over decades because these parasites underneath that utilize their position and why I say parasites
[03:26:25.410 --> 03:26:27.371]  Not all public employees, for sure.
[03:26:27.371 --> 03:26:36.353]  Most are not in this category, but the ones that are using it for their own private political agenda, which is actually forbidden.
[03:26:36.353 --> 03:26:38.394]  There's laws on the books at the national level.
[03:26:38.394 --> 03:26:45.376]  Federal employees aren't supposed to engage in a political agenda, but they do.
[03:26:45.376 --> 03:26:50.398]  And when they do, it violates the rules consistently and constantly.
[03:26:50.398 --> 03:26:53.859]  And as a consequence, you end up with a whole set of rules
[03:26:54.696 --> 03:26:55.417]  Play out again.
[03:27:06.138 --> 03:27:11.221]  Upcoming events in terms of regulation and what happens next.
[03:27:11.221 --> 03:27:24.749]  You know, this election is going to decide whether we're going to have a developmental strategy for the United States or the Haydn-Biden strategy of not doing anything and fall back into the lackluster world of watching the U.S.
[03:27:24.749 --> 03:27:34.515]  collapse, because we have to remember in the global perspective of the globalists out there driving most of the politics for most nations in the world,
[03:27:35.194 --> 03:27:39.117]  With the exception of a few who have different agendas.
[03:27:39.117 --> 03:27:41.699]  And here's the thing about all those agendas.
[03:27:41.699 --> 03:27:43.541]  They don't work for you and me.
[03:27:43.541 --> 03:27:47.744]  They don't work for the information warrior at all.
[03:27:47.744 --> 03:27:51.828]  In fact, they work against us most of the time.
[03:27:51.828 --> 03:27:53.469]  And here's the thing.
[03:27:53.469 --> 03:27:56.652]  As we're looking at the regulatory matrix and the next
[03:27:57.779 --> 03:28:02.465]  Election at the executive level because that's where it's at to executive orders.
[03:28:02.465 --> 03:28:06.189]  You cannot a lot of that and we've seen that during the Trump administration.
[03:28:06.189 --> 03:28:11.475]  We saw some of that during Obama to in a not so good of a direction.
[03:28:11.475 --> 03:28:17.262]  But here's the thing is we have the opportunity now to make those changes and they have been made.
[03:28:17.822 --> 03:28:24.744]  We have the opportunity right now to elect Donald Trump again and continue the progress in that direction for the next four years.
[03:28:24.744 --> 03:28:27.704]  And I think it's incumbent on all of us to do it.
[03:28:27.704 --> 03:28:34.666]  The t-shirt I'm wearing today, the bureaucracy, the deep state swallowing Alaska and shutting us down.
[03:28:34.666 --> 03:28:36.406]  We're the balance sheet for the nation.
[03:28:36.406 --> 03:28:38.427]  We're the wealth of the nation.
[03:28:38.427 --> 03:28:42.007]  Coming up next week is the Miners Convention for Alaska.
[03:28:42.007 --> 03:28:44.268]  It's free this year because it's a virtual event.
[03:28:44.912 --> 03:28:45.672]  Free!
[03:28:45.672 --> 03:28:49.614]  Normally it's a couple hundred dollars just to get in.
[03:28:49.614 --> 03:29:05.939]  And so all the presentations on the Alaska Miners Convention, you can go to Alaska Miners with an S, alaskaminers.org, alaskaminers.org, and you can register and sign up for free for the Miners Convention.
[03:29:05.939 --> 03:29:13.082]  And on Tuesday afternoon, my time and on Eastern Time, just a little bit before eight o'clock, I'm going to be making a presentation
[03:29:13.889 --> 03:29:18.651]  On my project in the wilderness to the Miners' Convention.
[03:29:18.651 --> 03:29:23.373]  But dial in and look at that and learn a lot about Alaskan resources.
[03:29:23.373 --> 03:29:27.655]  At least dial in for maybe the keynote address and some of the events.
[03:29:27.655 --> 03:29:35.959]  But take a look at alaskaminers.org and take a look at what we're doing in development in Alaska.
[03:29:35.959 --> 03:29:37.820]  You know, the thing about all of this
[03:29:38.900 --> 03:29:52.343]  Right now, when we look at the crossroads we're on, if we can begin to look at how do we develop the basis of wealth in the nation with the next administration, and we need someone who can do a business plan.
[03:29:53.320 --> 03:30:14.065]  Biden has had 48 years of the do-nothing plan of politics because when all you've done is politics, well I guess he's done a little bit of business and we've been reading about it in the New York Post and it's been dead silent almost everywhere else, but I guess he's been doing private business too, just not the kind you and I appreciate.
[03:30:15.826 --> 03:30:23.491]  It's hiding Biden's business, which he hides also apparently, because hiding Biden bribery business is the wrong one.
[03:30:23.491 --> 03:30:32.296]  Because no longer is he using the committees and contributions model, he's using the brown bag model through his relative.
[03:30:32.296 --> 03:30:34.297]  Sad story.
[03:30:34.297 --> 03:30:38.180]  Biden, Biden, bribery, scandal.
[03:30:38.180 --> 03:30:39.881]  That's what we have right now.
[03:30:39.881 --> 03:30:43.563]  And a half a century, almost a half a century,
[03:30:44.401 --> 03:30:49.345]  Of bad behavior and bad governance and no practical experience.
[03:30:49.345 --> 03:30:53.568]  And, you know, I admit, I admit this about Donald Trump.
[03:30:53.568 --> 03:31:00.374]  He is ugly in the presentation, you know, can be pretty vulgar, but I appreciate it because I know what he's had to deal with.
[03:31:00.374 --> 03:31:06.799]  The most corrupt government in the country is New York, New York State, New York City.
[03:31:06.799 --> 03:31:08.240]  Look at that mess they have.
[03:31:08.240 --> 03:31:12.223]  And how many times has the American public bailed that mess out?
[03:31:12.805 --> 03:31:14.906]  And they want us to do it again.
[03:31:14.906 --> 03:31:16.107]  Look back in history.
[03:31:16.107 --> 03:31:21.470]  Look up New York bailouts and you'll see a whole laundry list up.
[03:31:21.470 --> 03:31:29.095]  And yet we're not seeing anything happen dealing with that laundry list that's out there right now.
[03:31:29.095 --> 03:31:33.037]  And you know, when you think about all of the things happening in the country right now,
[03:31:34.514 --> 03:31:40.058]  And it's a fight over the wealth of the nation, starting with the leadership.
[03:31:40.058 --> 03:31:42.819]  Because here's the thing that everyone needs to remember.
[03:31:42.819 --> 03:31:45.981]  In classical organizing, you try and co-op.
[03:31:45.981 --> 03:31:47.802]  It's called co-option.
[03:31:47.802 --> 03:31:49.804]  Co-op the leadership.
[03:31:49.804 --> 03:31:53.466]  If you can take the leadership, everyone else follows.
[03:31:53.466 --> 03:31:54.627]  You see?
[03:31:54.627 --> 03:31:56.228]  It's that simple.
[03:31:56.228 --> 03:32:02.752]  And so, there's a lot of effort channeled directly in like a fire hose
[03:32:03.539 --> 03:32:04.879]  To the leadership.
[03:32:04.879 --> 03:32:06.860]  To corrupt them.
[03:32:06.860 --> 03:32:08.121]  To break them.
[03:32:08.121 --> 03:32:14.723]  To blackmail them later, extort legislation, favors, whatever it is you're looking for.
[03:32:14.723 --> 03:32:16.483]  And this is what has happened.
[03:32:16.483 --> 03:32:26.147]  So we have a corrupted elected layer, and a corrupted bureaucratic layer, and the same people are pushing against both.
[03:32:26.147 --> 03:32:29.828]  Against you and I. And it is the deep state.
[03:32:29.828 --> 03:32:32.329]  It is the snake coiled around the country.
[03:32:33.504 --> 03:32:42.712]  And we have an opportunity in the next election cycle to dislodge it and to take a look at our possibilities, our future possibilities.
[03:32:42.712 --> 03:32:45.675]  Again, check out the Miners Convention all next week.
[03:32:45.675 --> 03:32:50.159]  Look at the agenda at alaskaminers.org.
[03:32:50.159 --> 03:32:53.242]  That's the Miners Association up here in Alaska, and it's free.
[03:32:54.218 --> 03:33:00.039]  Get a handle on some of what's going on up here, because this is the treasury of the nation.
[03:33:00.039 --> 03:33:16.663]  If we can take our minerals and resources from this treasury and begin to move them into the country, to link up the rail system, to set up the infrastructures that are necessary for the last frontier to become the first frontier, the first frontier for freedom,
[03:33:17.333 --> 03:33:26.219]  A different approach to what's going on in our world right now by recognizing what we have and the possibilities that are in front of us right now.
[03:33:26.219 --> 03:33:27.439]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[03:33:27.439 --> 03:33:29.000]  You're listening to the InfoWars.
[03:33:29.000 --> 03:33:32.222]  Check out InfoWarsStore.com.
[03:33:32.222 --> 03:33:33.063]  This is Nick Begich.
[03:33:33.063 --> 03:33:33.903]  We'll be right back.
[03:33:33.903 --> 03:33:35.444]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:33:54.079 --> 03:33:55.940]  InfoWars has been banned.
[03:33:55.940 --> 03:33:58.900]  Arrested.
[03:33:58.900 --> 03:34:05.122]  Attacked and threatened.
[03:34:05.122 --> 03:34:08.423]  Because we are effective.
[03:34:08.423 --> 03:34:10.243]  The Great Awakening is here.

[03:34:39.491 --> 03:34:47.356]  InfoWars has been reporting on the dark, unpleasant truths of big government corruption for over two decades.
[03:34:47.356 --> 03:34:49.418]  It is why they attack us.
[03:34:49.418 --> 03:34:53.541]  And it is why we are now the most banned broadcast in the world.
[03:34:54.778 --> 03:34:59.520]  The Hunter Biden hard drive scandal is merely the tip of the iceberg.
[03:34:59.520 --> 03:35:02.121]  Evil has infested governments everywhere.
[03:35:02.121 --> 03:35:07.584]  But the evil establishment is censoring content across all media platforms.
[03:35:07.584 --> 03:35:11.606]  They blocked you from sharing band.video on social media.
[03:35:11.606 --> 03:35:17.609]  So go to electionnight.news and share it like your lives depended on it.
[03:35:19.164 --> 03:35:27.409]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID, vaccines, Bill Gates, and Big Pharma.
[03:35:27.409 --> 03:35:34.874]  Go to electionnight.news to find all the information the crooked establishment is most afraid of.
[03:35:34.874 --> 03:35:38.556]  Go to electionnight.news and share now.
[03:35:40.868 --> 03:35:45.331]  Two Info Wars best-selling products are now back in stock for being sold out for months.
[03:35:45.331 --> 03:35:51.516]  Bio-True Selenium from the mustard seed, essential in all electrochemical activity of the cells in the body.
[03:35:51.516 --> 03:35:53.317]  That's every human activity.
[03:35:53.317 --> 03:35:58.901]  And on top of it, Bobby's Ultimate Turmeric Formula with 95% curcuminoid.
[03:35:58.901 --> 03:36:01.743]  Leading competitors have 3% to 5%.
[03:36:01.743 --> 03:36:06.407]  The things that turmeric does, I don't have to tell you, this is the highest quality, the strongest you're going to find.
[03:36:06.887 --> 03:36:11.872]  So both these are amazing products, and they fund the InfoWar, which is a 360 win.
[03:36:11.872 --> 03:36:22.183]  On top of it, despite the factory demand, they've been sold out for months, they're both 50% off, triple Patriot points, and free shipping at InfoWarStore.com.
[03:36:22.583 --> 03:36:25.745]  That's Bio True Selenium from the mustard seed.
[03:36:25.745 --> 03:36:27.045]  It's amazing.
[03:36:27.045 --> 03:36:32.628]  And on top of it, we also have Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:36:32.628 --> 03:36:34.289]  This sale will not last long.
[03:36:34.289 --> 03:36:35.690]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[03:36:35.690 --> 03:36:39.231]  If you really need to try these products, people absolutely love them because they really, really work.
[03:36:39.231 --> 03:36:40.172]  InfoWareStore.com.

[03:37:06.144 --> 03:37:08.406]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[03:37:08.406 --> 03:37:09.807]  I suggest Band.Video.
[03:37:10.487 --> 03:37:15.950]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[03:37:15.950 --> 03:37:24.414]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[03:37:24.414 --> 03:37:32.277]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube, however you want.
[03:37:32.277 --> 03:37:33.938]  Be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[03:37:43.255 --> 03:38:00.804]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:38:00.804 --> 03:38:02.905]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:38:02.905 --> 03:38:04.846]  Because there is a war on.
[03:38:04.846 --> 03:38:06.467]  For your mind.
[03:38:06.467 --> 03:38:08.368]  With Nick Begich.
[03:38:15.011 --> 03:38:19.976]  You know, thinking about all of this stuff and what we're dealing with these days in the world.
[03:38:21.082 --> 03:38:27.326]  And I want to, I'm trying to keep tied into the election because it's coming up next Tuesday.
[03:38:27.326 --> 03:38:29.968]  We all need to focus on that as well.
[03:38:29.968 --> 03:38:38.593]  But not forget the accomplishments that have already been made and regulatory breaking down this bureaucracy is a critical element.
[03:38:38.593 --> 03:38:43.756]  You know, the amount of complexity, small business people is enormous.
[03:38:43.756 --> 03:38:47.219]  On the mining side, you want to talk about complexity.
[03:38:47.219 --> 03:38:48.459]  I'll show you some paperwork.
[03:38:49.660 --> 03:38:58.344]  In the room next door I have like boxes and boxes of archival material just to get through my permitting process for my project out in the wilderness.
[03:38:58.344 --> 03:39:04.668]  Just for the roads and facilities that you need to put in, the amount of regulation is phenomenal.
[03:39:04.668 --> 03:39:07.209]  So cutting through the red tape
[03:39:07.890 --> 03:39:08.230]  Thank you.
[03:39:30.004 --> 03:39:30.245]  All right.
[03:39:46.957 --> 03:39:52.941]  It is a number of projects, probably 20 major projects in various stages of development.
[03:39:52.941 --> 03:40:01.747]  Some of them, like mine, are called prospects or in the early stages where you're developing your data and building out your infrastructure, improving up your value.
[03:40:01.747 --> 03:40:06.310]  Other are more matured and they're permitting, are about to go, about to be green lit.
[03:40:07.191 --> 03:40:18.600]  For their next stage, they finish their economic analyses, which are really highly regulated for these public companies, what they have to do before they go out and raise money from the public.
[03:40:18.600 --> 03:40:22.843]  The next phase are the developmental stages where they start putting.
[03:40:24.648 --> 03:40:26.870]  Iron into the ground.
[03:40:26.870 --> 03:40:29.253]  And some of those are about to start.
[03:40:29.253 --> 03:40:34.978]  Donlon Creek, which is a $6 billion project in southwest Alaska.
[03:40:34.978 --> 03:40:37.661]  This is a huge project.
[03:40:37.661 --> 03:40:44.648]  When they get that done, it's going to open up an entire area of the state that's not had transportation corridor to tidewater.
[03:40:44.648 --> 03:40:46.389]  It has not had any kind of a linkage.
[03:40:46.389 --> 03:40:48.011]  It's going to have a gas line and a road.
[03:40:49.051 --> 03:40:56.676]  So, for the first time, it's going to have power, cheap energy, a natural gas flowing 350 miles to that mine.
[03:40:56.676 --> 03:41:06.641]  And that mine will use as much energy converted from that gas as the second largest city in Alaska, Fairbanks, uses on its peak production.
[03:41:06.641 --> 03:41:08.402]  You know, think about that.
[03:41:08.402 --> 03:41:13.845]  One mine in Alaska is going to use as much energy as the second largest city in the state.
[03:41:14.779 --> 03:41:16.920]  You know, that's huge!
[03:41:16.920 --> 03:41:18.580]  Okay, that's one.
[03:41:18.580 --> 03:41:32.783]  There's others that are being looked at across Alaska from rare earths at Tidewater in southeast, carbon up north, graphite in particular, graphite and graphene.
[03:41:32.783 --> 03:41:35.204]  These are strategic metals, minerals.
[03:41:35.204 --> 03:41:41.845]  We have tin, molybdenum, copper, zinc, gold, silver, platinum, palladium, on and on and on.
[03:41:42.694 --> 03:41:45.256]  And why is that important?
[03:41:45.256 --> 03:41:50.859]  Because these represent values that we hold as Americans in common.
[03:41:50.859 --> 03:42:01.306]  The areas that are on private property, like mine, or on native land, or on state land, or on federal land, have various rules for development.
[03:42:01.306 --> 03:42:05.929]  And on federal land, on certain federal lands, you and I as Americans,
[03:42:06.740 --> 03:42:15.027]  If we're over the age of 18, you can go out and make a location, find something, stake it, and claim it, and then develop it.
[03:42:15.027 --> 03:42:16.308]  You can do all of that.
[03:42:16.308 --> 03:42:17.910]  On the state level, you can too.
[03:42:17.910 --> 03:42:21.293]  On your private land, of course, if you have the mineral rights, you can too.
[03:42:22.120 --> 03:42:26.964]  And this is what's important is a lot of people don't understand the stratification of rights.
[03:42:26.964 --> 03:42:30.727]  You own your home in most parts of the western states.
[03:42:30.727 --> 03:42:32.188]  You own the surface estate.
[03:42:32.188 --> 03:42:36.732]  You own what's on the top of the ground to build your home and a few feet under.
[03:42:36.732 --> 03:42:40.295]  But the mineral estate is reserved to someone else, usually the government.
[03:42:41.016 --> 03:42:51.859]  Unless it was taken years and years ago when homesteads and things were mineral estates were allowed to flow and energy estate oil and gas because most energy in the West is owned by governments.
[03:42:52.857 --> 03:42:58.020]  And most of the mineral rights are also owned by governments.
[03:42:58.020 --> 03:43:03.723]  Now, native organizations, tribal governments, they own their mineral rights and energy rights.
[03:43:03.723 --> 03:43:07.926]  Native corporations have theirs intact in Alaska.
[03:43:07.926 --> 03:43:13.749]  When you look at the state rights, theirs are intact and how they regulate them is up to state jurisdiction.
[03:43:13.749 --> 03:43:17.311]  On the federal level, some are in parks and preserves, which are excluded.
[03:43:17.992 --> 03:43:26.033]  Right now from development and that was one of the tricks of early legislation that my dad was involved in and then when he disappeared others were involved in.
[03:43:26.661 --> 03:43:31.986]  But what happened here in Alaska is the minerals were always the thrust.
[03:43:31.986 --> 03:43:35.169]  Democrats, Republicans agreed on that here.
[03:43:35.169 --> 03:43:45.599]  Most still do, except for these crazy Democrats who show up from somewhere else, mainly California, with some other idea of what it ought to look like.
[03:43:45.599 --> 03:43:49.643]  You know, it's like such a weirdness of what we've seen happen.
[03:43:50.632 --> 03:43:52.893]  Main party politics at the national level.
[03:43:52.893 --> 03:43:55.574]  The Democrats have become the party of the weirdos.
[03:43:55.574 --> 03:44:01.235]  And the Republicans, you know, when they bring out their mainstream candidates, they don't look so good.
[03:44:01.235 --> 03:44:07.397]  But Donald Trump reformed the Republican Party, made it a workings man and a business party, small business party.
[03:44:07.397 --> 03:44:08.818]  Wow, what a change.
[03:44:09.756 --> 03:44:10.957]  You know, that's a change.
[03:44:10.957 --> 03:44:19.404]  He hijacked the Republicans and hijacked the American public into a program that we can actually start to believe in again.
[03:44:19.404 --> 03:44:23.648]  And I hope it continues another four years and people do your last push.
[03:44:23.648 --> 03:44:26.410]  If you haven't voted, go vote now.
[03:44:26.410 --> 03:44:28.692]  Vote now.
[03:44:28.692 --> 03:44:34.116]  What if you have an earthquake on Tuesday or a hurricane blow through your community on Tuesday?
[03:44:34.116 --> 03:44:34.837]  Vote right now.
[03:44:35.948 --> 03:44:38.250]  Do it right now because it's important to get it done.
[03:44:38.250 --> 03:44:39.311]  Do it over the weekend.
[03:44:39.311 --> 03:44:40.132]  Do it on Monday.
[03:44:40.132 --> 03:44:41.693]  Don't wait for Tuesday.
[03:44:41.693 --> 03:44:44.035]  Your states are opened up where you can do early voting.
[03:44:44.035 --> 03:44:46.457]  Go stand in line early.
[03:44:46.457 --> 03:44:47.919]  I'm going to.
[03:44:47.919 --> 03:44:49.780]  My fiance is going to.
[03:44:49.780 --> 03:44:56.326]  It's important to vote early because you don't want to be missed in the count this time for sure.
[03:44:56.326 --> 03:44:58.888]  And you don't want anything getting your way on Monday.
[03:44:58.888 --> 03:45:02.652]  A kid getting sick or anything else.
[03:45:02.652 --> 03:45:02.892]  Vote.
[03:45:04.386 --> 03:45:07.687]  That's where the power still is for the moment.
[03:45:07.687 --> 03:45:27.433]  This may be the last chance after this cycle, because man, the propaganda cycle, the surveillance state coupled with the deep state is going to give us a radical change if we don't show up this election cycle.
[03:45:27.433 --> 03:45:29.833]  It's absolutely critical.
[03:45:29.833 --> 03:45:32.414]  Even if you are looking at this thing and say,
[03:45:33.416 --> 03:45:35.036]  He's not the best?
[03:45:35.036 --> 03:45:38.217]  I don't agree for this reason.
[03:45:38.217 --> 03:45:44.219]  He's not the prettiest, but he is the best for right now, for what we're facing right now.
[03:45:44.219 --> 03:45:53.041]  And sometimes, as Alex said in that last segment as we were listening, softer voice, you know, a softer voice when people listen.
[03:45:53.041 --> 03:46:02.243]  Well, sometimes it's important to carry a baseball bat and have a very loud voice because you got to get people's attention.
[03:46:03.231 --> 03:46:04.512]  Donald Trump has done that.
[03:46:04.512 --> 03:46:18.320]  When he wins the second election, which I believe will happen on Tuesday, he can soften the voice and carry the club because there isn't anything left to yell about.
[03:46:18.320 --> 03:46:25.565]  He's got four years to front end the program and a two-year midterm cycle to maybe change a little of Congress.
[03:46:25.565 --> 03:46:32.309]  And that's where the emphasis should be, ladies and gentlemen, in taking America back and holding it.
[03:46:33.084 --> 03:46:34.044]  Okay?
[03:46:34.044 --> 03:46:37.805]  Because when this term is up in four years, who's coming next?
[03:46:37.805 --> 03:46:46.668]  Who's the next guy up that you're going to believe in that isn't another one of these deep state insiders just going to unravel the knot again?
[03:46:46.668 --> 03:46:48.609]  So we need to pay attention now.
[03:46:48.609 --> 03:46:51.490]  We need to get a lot of work done now.
[03:46:51.490 --> 03:46:56.731]  There's a Supreme Court installed now that's going to be there now for the next 30 years.
[03:46:56.731 --> 03:47:01.953]  So at least that piece of the government has been preserved as a balanced piece.
[03:47:02.782 --> 03:47:07.945]  To take a conservative view of what that Constitution means, which I think is an appropriate view.
[03:47:07.945 --> 03:47:17.429]  This Constitution should be interpreted clearly as it was written, and if it needs to be changed, see, we allow for that in this country.
[03:47:17.429 --> 03:47:22.252]  And what the left has forgotten is it was designed as a living document.
[03:47:22.252 --> 03:47:25.193]  There's been many amendments since the first ten.
[03:47:25.193 --> 03:47:27.674]  The Bill of Rights, you see.
[03:47:27.674 --> 03:47:28.635]  Because in our country,
[03:47:29.497 --> 03:47:35.180]  In the United States, we recognize that we learn more about ourselves as a nation, as individuals.
[03:47:35.180 --> 03:47:36.401]  And we change.
[03:47:36.401 --> 03:47:37.882]  And we have.
[03:47:37.882 --> 03:47:41.384]  When we started out as a nation, you had to be a property owner to vote.
[03:47:41.384 --> 03:47:43.185]  And then you didn't have to.
[03:47:43.185 --> 03:47:46.007]  And then you had to be a white man to vote.
[03:47:46.007 --> 03:47:47.127]  And then you didn't have to be.
[03:47:47.127 --> 03:47:48.888]  You could be a black man, too.
[03:47:48.888 --> 03:47:55.212]  And then after that, you could be a woman and a man and vote, no matter what your race was.
[03:47:55.212 --> 03:47:56.333]  Because that came later, too.
[03:47:57.190 --> 03:48:04.754]  And public education and the income tax and lots of things came later, you see.
[03:48:04.754 --> 03:48:06.835]  They didn't start with the founding of the nation.
[03:48:06.835 --> 03:48:08.956]  They came with the growth of a nation.
[03:48:08.956 --> 03:48:11.537]  Because you and I are the nation.
[03:48:11.537 --> 03:48:13.058]  We're the tip of the spear.
[03:48:13.058 --> 03:48:14.939]  We're the base of the program.
[03:48:14.939 --> 03:48:18.460]  This is Dr. Nick Begich and you've been listening to The Info Wars.
[03:48:18.460 --> 03:48:23.943]  We're changing the world one time, one day, one person at a time.
[03:48:23.943 --> 03:48:24.883]  See you next time.
[03:48:24.883 --> 03:48:25.524]  This has been Dr. Nick.
