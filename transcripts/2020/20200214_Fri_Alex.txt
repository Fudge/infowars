[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:05.131]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:09.453 --> 00:00:17.497]  Well, it was just last week that President Trump was completely exonerated, and then there was almost no coverage of it.
[00:00:18.117 --> 00:00:21.298]  And I kept saying, what will the new scandal be?
[00:00:21.498 --> 00:00:22.839]  What will the new scandal be?
[00:00:23.299 --> 00:00:24.439]  What will the new scandal be?
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.180]  And I predicted
[00:00:26.383 --> 00:00:29.444]  That one of the big scandals would be the President just being the President.
[00:00:29.524 --> 00:00:41.367]  Normal function of the President is criminal, is illegal to these individuals.
[00:00:42.107 --> 00:00:55.571]  And now the President talking about a kangaroo court, talking about the jury foreperson being a big Democrat operative, that's supposedly obstruction of justice when it's the President's purview to completely
[00:00:56.536 --> 00:00:58.637]  Pardon someone if he wants to.
[00:01:00.438 --> 00:01:02.619]  So Trump's not claiming a legal right to interfere.
[00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.520]  It's what the executive branch can do.
[00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:08.882]  And then if we don't like what he does, we don't vote for him.
[00:01:09.822 --> 00:01:11.943]  Again, but that's a separate branch of government.
[00:01:12.523 --> 00:01:18.266]  If you didn't have that power in the executive, you would have the other branches always overthrowing it like a third world country.
[00:01:18.306 --> 00:01:24.529]  And that's exactly what's starting to happen as America resembles in so many ways a third world nation in our behavior.
[00:01:25.888 --> 00:01:40.713]  So AG Barr came out and said that he won't be bullied, and he basically said that Trump was doing bad things when he's not, and so that shows you the deep state's really panicked because Trump's purging it, and that Barr is showing his true colors.
[00:01:40.913 --> 00:01:44.474]  Or is this to get heat off of Barr from the Democrats?
[00:01:44.674 --> 00:01:45.714]  There shouldn't be any heat.
[00:01:46.094 --> 00:01:49.855]  They should stop bowing to them and acting like the claims they make are legitimate.
[00:01:50.175 --> 00:01:51.796]  Here's what Barr had to say.
[00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:58.263]  I had made a decision that I thought was fair and reasonable in this particular case.
[00:01:59.224 --> 00:02:04.187]  And once the tweet occurred, the question is, well, now what do I do?
[00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:09.811]  And do you go forward with what you think is the right decision or do you pull back because of the tweet?
[00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:13.093]  And that just sort of illustrates how disruptive these tweets can be.
[00:02:13.474 --> 00:02:15.155]  So you're saying you have a problem with the tweets?
[00:02:16.294 --> 00:02:21.496]  Yes, well, I have a problem with some of the tweets.
[00:02:21.576 --> 00:02:26.878]  I'm happy to say that, in fact, the president has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case.
[00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:42.644]  However, to have public statements and tweets made about the department, about our people in the department, our men and women here, about cases pending in the department,
[00:02:43.183 --> 00:02:45.485]  Mr. Barr, the President does not like to be told what to do.
[00:02:45.625 --> 00:02:48.268]  He may not like what you're saying.
[00:02:48.288 --> 00:02:50.790]  Are you prepared for those ramifications?
[00:03:12.077 --> 00:03:12.818]  Of course.
[00:03:12.998 --> 00:03:18.601]  As I said during my confirmation, I came in to serve as Attorney General.
[00:03:20.823 --> 00:03:28.930]  I am responsible for everything that happens in the department, but the thing I have most responsibility for are the issues that are brought to me for decision.
[00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:37.797]  And I will make those decisions based on what I think is the right thing to do, and I'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody.
[00:03:37.837 --> 00:03:44.022]  And I said at the time, whether it's Congress, newspaper, editorial boards, or the president, I'm going to do what I think is right.
[00:03:45.063 --> 00:03:58.834]  And, you know, I cannot do my job here at the department with constant background commentary that undercuts me.
[00:04:00.896 --> 00:04:02.498]  That's quite an attack on the president.
[00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:16.527]  When the entire attack on Stone is an attack on the President and the election, and the judge and the prosecutors and the jurors have all been running their mouths everywhere, while Roger Stone has a big gag ball shoved in his face.
[00:04:17.707 --> 00:04:27.373]  And they've been in the Washington Post calling for my arrest, because I pointed out that these juries look like the Democratic National Committee's
[00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:29.389]  Frontline.
[00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.691]  Unbelievable.
[00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:35.873]  And Dr. Steve Pachinik is going to be joining us coming up in the second hour.
[00:04:35.933 --> 00:04:37.494]  He says bars got to go.
[00:04:39.416 --> 00:04:41.477]  Also, huge developments on the virus front.
[00:04:41.517 --> 00:04:43.698]  The biggest yet on the other side.
[00:04:43.738 --> 00:04:45.419]  Back in T-minus 60 seconds.
[00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:46.420]  Start your engines.
[00:04:56.104 --> 00:05:11.110]  As President Trump continues to battle the globalist forces of the deep state, the Democrat Party continues to take off its mask and reveal themselves as the true enemy of America and its people.
[00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:16.132]  Last week, Trump delivered a historic State of the Union address, which
[00:05:16.152 --> 00:05:22.496]  Which included an emotional tribute to honor one of the last remaining heroes of World War II.
[00:05:22.796 --> 00:05:23.437]  But wait a minute.
[00:05:23.737 --> 00:05:27.239]  Who the hell is that sitting on their asses during the tribute?
[00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:28.340]  You guessed it.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:29.941]  The enemy within.
[00:05:30.261 --> 00:05:35.264]  That's radical leftist Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib caught on camera.
[00:05:35.504 --> 00:05:51.508]  Seen here, refusing to stand up and honor Charles Magee of the legendary Tuskegee Airmen, a unit of black fighter and bomber pilots who distinguished themselves during fierce aerial combat missions in World War II.
[00:05:51.868 --> 00:05:55.949]  After more than 130 combat missions in World War II,
[00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:04.517]  He came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam.
[00:06:04.938 --> 00:06:09.783]  On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:20.064]  As Republicans and Democrats rose to applaud this all-American hero, Omar and Tlaib just couldn't bring themselves to do so.
[00:06:20.604 --> 00:06:29.528]  In fact, they ended up walking out of the speech early in defiance of what Rashida Tlaib said was Trump's lies and bigotry.
[00:06:29.928 --> 00:06:32.089]  But hey, this shouldn't really surprise anyone.
[00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.531]  After all, these are among the same radical leftists
[00:06:35.731 --> 00:06:42.394]  ...who refused to condemn Antifa after their terrorist attack on an ICE facility in Tacoma, Washington.
[00:06:42.514 --> 00:06:48.557]  We are learning new details about the man who threw explosive devices at an immigration detention center in Tacoma, Washington.
[00:06:48.577 --> 00:06:57.801]  Police are saying that a man was armed with a rifle and firebombs and attacked a private facility operated on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.
[00:06:57.981 --> 00:07:04.224]  Villain Von Spronson, who was linked with the Antifa domestic terror movement, attacked an ICE facility in Tacoma.
[00:07:04.705 --> 00:07:06.746]  He was carrying an AR-15 and firebombs.
[00:07:06.946 --> 00:07:10.328]  He torched several cars that apparently hoped to burn the facility to the ground.
[00:07:10.808 --> 00:07:12.329]  He was shot dead before he could kill anyone.
[00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:15.490]  Will you condemn the Antifa attack in Washington over the weekend?
[00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:18.572]  It's easy to condemn terrorism.
[00:07:18.592 --> 00:07:19.112]  Will you condemn it?
[00:07:20.093 --> 00:07:23.314]  Antifa firebombed a facility in Tacoma over the weekend.
[00:07:23.374 --> 00:07:24.275]  It's an ICE facility.
[00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:26.076]  Will you condemn them for that?
[00:07:27.458 --> 00:07:27.978]  Are you pleased?
[00:07:29.679 --> 00:07:30.579]  Should more people do it?
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.460]  It's easy to say no.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.722]  Look, we know who these people are and we know their agenda.
[00:07:38.822 --> 00:07:40.922]  We're gonna go in there, we're gonna impeach the motherfucker.
[00:07:40.962 --> 00:07:45.624]  But Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib are not really traitors to America.
[00:07:46.464 --> 00:07:51.906]  To me, if you really think about it, they're more like infiltrators.
[00:07:57.808 --> 00:08:02.211]  Shocking disrespect, Omar and Tlaib refused to honor black World War II hero.
[00:08:03.272 --> 00:08:05.014]  And that's just who these scumbags are.
[00:08:05.114 --> 00:08:06.235]  They hate this country.
[00:08:07.135 --> 00:08:09.117]  They brag about how they hate this country.
[00:08:09.797 --> 00:08:17.243]  And that's what the Democrats and the globalists would like to end up doing is dividing and conquering this nation.
[00:08:17.743 --> 00:08:20.005]  It's not going to happen as fast as they think it will.
[00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:24.589]  And in fact, if we really work hard and expose them and get back in their faces and aren't intimidated,
[00:08:26.638 --> 00:08:28.800]  We can completely turn the tide, and we are.
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.524]  That report is up on InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[00:08:33.564 --> 00:08:36.346]  It's in the Darren McBrain section on Band.Video.
[00:08:36.486 --> 00:08:37.707]  Please get it out to everybody you know.
[00:08:37.747 --> 00:08:39.889]  It's powerful truth and needs to be seen.
[00:08:39.929 --> 00:08:41.730]  The only way it gets out there is you.
[00:08:43.031 --> 00:08:55.141]  As you see all the big Jeffrey Epstein information breaking, as you see all the corruption coming out, everything we told you about confirmed, we're more banned than we were before.
[00:08:56.462 --> 00:09:13.694]  And I've got all this incredible breaking news, but I ended the show yesterday with something I want to get to later in the third hour, and that's Senator Rand Paul's speech on the Senate floor is being taken off YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, and they say it violates community standards.
[00:09:14.735 --> 00:09:18.198]  So the Senate's going to put up with that now, I guess.
[00:09:19.366 --> 00:09:21.888]  This is total suppression of the American people.
[00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:23.589]  It's organized crime.
[00:09:24.489 --> 00:09:28.051]  And if Scientologists were doing this, they'd all be arrested.
[00:09:28.652 --> 00:09:31.894]  Or if the Italian Mafia was doing it, they'd all be arrested.
[00:09:32.334 --> 00:09:35.316]  But when it's Big Tech doing it, it's like, oh, they're a private company.
[00:09:35.336 --> 00:09:47.243]  They can spy on us illegally and sell our data and block what Senator Paul said about the witch hunt.
[00:09:51.184 --> 00:09:52.345]  A genteel doctor.
[00:09:54.366 --> 00:09:55.186]  And he can't be heard.
[00:09:56.687 --> 00:09:59.248]  And the Senate just keeps taking it.
[00:10:00.249 --> 00:10:01.629]  Trump keeps going along with it.
[00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:06.312]  And you know, I'm glad Trump's in there, but more and more I'm like Matt Grudge.
[00:10:06.452 --> 00:10:14.736]  I mean, I'm just pissed off that Trump sits there and allows the Democrats to engage in the persecution of Trump supporters like this.
[00:10:16.076 --> 00:10:17.017]  It's very un-American.
[00:10:17.637 --> 00:10:18.738]  It's very, very dangerous.
[00:10:19.991 --> 00:10:26.795]  But it's part of a unified global operation where governments are scared because they know their corruption's coming out.
[00:10:29.676 --> 00:10:36.260]  And so bipartisanly, they are going along with censorship.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.101]  Big story up on Infowars.com.
[00:10:39.241 --> 00:10:47.826]  UK approves large-scale internet censorship across the board with Boris Johnson, who I support Brexit and I support nationalism,
[00:10:49.534 --> 00:10:50.634]  But what he's doing is horrible.
[00:10:53.115 --> 00:10:56.296]  It's authoritarianism, and it's bipartisan, and it's dangerous.
[00:10:57.937 --> 00:11:06.880]  And so, if we don't see action the next month or so by the President, it's time to go to the Trump rallies and peacefully take them over.
[00:11:07.901 --> 00:11:09.101]  And we've got a plan to do that.
[00:11:11.022 --> 00:11:15.404]  And I've been busy with a lot of other things, haven't quite launched it yet, but I'm going to get it launched today.
[00:11:17.304 --> 00:11:19.105]  So look for that, because I'm not going to put up
[00:11:20.253 --> 00:11:26.036]  With the Blue Bloods and the snot-nosed Republican establishment derailing our movement to save this Republic.
[00:11:26.116 --> 00:11:28.657]  I'm not going to trade out one group of tyrants for another.
[00:11:30.778 --> 00:11:32.179]  I'm going to think about this carefully.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:39.122]  But as soon as Trump survives their attempts to remove him, it's time for him to get down to business.
[00:11:42.243 --> 00:11:44.264]  All right, let me just stop right there and tell you what's coming up.
[00:11:45.745 --> 00:11:49.307]  We know that Attorney General Barr has really come out against the President.
[00:11:50.535 --> 00:12:01.005]  Some people are saying that it's elaborate theater kabuki and that it's to get Democrat heat off the Attorney General for saying don't send it stone to an exorbitant amount of time.
[00:12:04.148 --> 00:12:09.653]  Well, Dr. Steve Pchenik is a smart guy, and he does know a lot of people in the deep, deep state.
[00:12:11.115 --> 00:12:13.357]  Not the lawyer bureaucracy, but you know, the folks
[00:12:14.704 --> 00:12:17.246]  In the military and those areas.
[00:12:17.947 --> 00:12:20.069]  And he really has a big problem with Barr.
[00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:22.611]  And he particularly wanted to come on the show today.
[00:12:22.771 --> 00:12:24.893]  So I'm told anytime he wants to come on, there's an open door.
[00:12:24.913 --> 00:12:28.877]  He thinks Barr needs to resign and he thinks Barr is going to make a move on the president.
[00:12:29.578 --> 00:12:32.040]  And I tend to agree with him because of the pedigree of Barr.
[00:12:32.701 --> 00:12:37.245]  You know, Barr is up to his eyeballs in Jeffrey Epstein stuff.
[00:12:38.166 --> 00:12:40.408]  And if I ever catch Trump
[00:12:41.465 --> 00:12:42.946]  Involved with any of the pedophile rings?
[00:12:43.086 --> 00:12:44.406]  I'll drop him like an old shoe.
[00:12:44.706 --> 00:12:49.908]  I've never found any evidence of that and instead you've seen massive arrests and we're moving against him and I think Trump's great for that.
[00:12:51.849 --> 00:13:03.113]  Every time I get mad at Trump I think about all the good stuff he's doing and balance it out but the Barr thing is problematic and we're gonna be chronicling Barr and who he really is next hour.
[00:13:06.977 --> 00:13:07.897]  There's no doubt he's smart.
[00:13:08.577 --> 00:13:13.258]  And there's no doubt that he's expanded investigations into human trafficking and done some good things.
[00:13:13.278 --> 00:13:17.299]  But he's covering up the Epstein death or event.
[00:13:18.339 --> 00:13:28.041]  And there's been no prosecutions in all the blackmail situations that the Clinton Crime Network has been using to control our government and academia.
[00:13:28.121 --> 00:13:29.461]  Why is everybody so scared of Hillary Clinton?
[00:13:30.261 --> 00:13:34.842]  Because they control
[00:13:36.570 --> 00:13:42.812]  Giant blackmail rings, and they've gotten the scientists, and the academics, and the intellectuals, and they've all got them into this club!
[00:13:44.033 --> 00:13:49.875]  And the people go have sex, not just with 15, 16-year-old girls, but even younger, they want to be compromised.
[00:13:49.915 --> 00:13:52.876]  You go to be videotaped having these orgies.
[00:13:53.796 --> 00:13:56.957]  And I told you that 25 years ago, and it was true then, and it's true now.
[00:13:57.317 --> 00:14:01.799]  I didn't just magically guess that, it all came true, just like I said, it was true.
[00:14:03.960 --> 00:14:04.660]  So that's coming up.
[00:14:05.709 --> 00:14:07.511]  We have a fellow from the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[00:14:07.551 --> 00:14:12.978]  He's a really smart guy popping into the show to talk about a host of issues and also intend to open the phones up.
[00:14:13.618 --> 00:14:15.060]  The virus is big.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.361]  The news is huge.
[00:14:16.422 --> 00:14:17.383]  I haven't hit that yet.
[00:14:17.683 --> 00:14:18.944]  We'll cover that next segment.
[00:14:19.929 --> 00:14:24.252]  And then we're going to get into the latest in the campaign trails and so much more.
[00:14:24.833 --> 00:14:30.998]  Lawsuits getting filed everywhere because all the major female sports are being dominated from MMA to track by men.
[00:14:31.718 --> 00:14:32.539]  It's ridiculous.
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.722]  It's like, go out and fight boys.
[00:14:35.742 --> 00:14:37.243]  Don't go out and fight girls, you punks.
[00:14:37.923 --> 00:14:38.864]  That's all coming up.
[00:14:38.904 --> 00:14:44.289]  Putin has said that as long as he's president, we're going to defend motherhood and fatherhood.
[00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:48.152]  Well, here we are on Valentine's Day.
[00:14:50.101 --> 00:14:53.022]  2020.
[00:14:50.321 --> 00:14:53.022]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:14:54.782 --> 00:14:59.484]  And if you're a TV viewer, you can see the big map here from John Hopkins.
[00:15:00.024 --> 00:15:02.725]  It's integrated into the World Health Organization and the CDC.
[00:15:04.885 --> 00:15:06.786]  Redfield is the head of the CDC.
[00:15:08.706 --> 00:15:10.687]  And here is a statement
[00:15:12.381 --> 00:15:15.443]  So far we've been able to contain it, but I think this virus is probably with us.
[00:15:36.752 --> 00:15:49.447]  Beyond this season or beyond this year and I think eventually the virus will find a foothold and we will get community-based transmission and you can start to think of it in a sense like seasonal flu.
[00:15:50.188 --> 00:15:51.330]  The only difference is we don't
[00:15:52.403 --> 00:15:58.005]  Now, going back a month ago, we said, is this just a giant world government police state drill?
[00:15:58.545 --> 00:16:09.049]  With Xi Jinping using it to crack down and to change the subject from losing the trade war with the U.S., massive insurrection, both on the mainland, but also in Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[00:16:09.649 --> 00:16:11.310]  Well, definitely they've used it for that.
[00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:16.872]  But now it's coming out that they've suppressed the numbers of infected and the numbers of dead massively.
[00:16:17.272 --> 00:16:21.074]  And the reason you're seeing hysteria in China is because
[00:16:22.062 --> 00:16:23.483]  The virus is man-made.
[00:16:23.523 --> 00:16:24.123]  We know that.
[00:16:24.563 --> 00:16:25.463]  It's been engineered.
[00:16:26.344 --> 00:16:27.904]  And there's a concerted effort to cover that up.
[00:16:28.344 --> 00:16:39.149]  Now we've had the head of the CDC and others come out and indeed say that we need to investigate whether this is man-made or not.
[00:16:39.409 --> 00:16:41.650]  Because the major universities have scanned it.
[00:16:41.750 --> 00:16:42.470]  It is man-made.
[00:16:44.617 --> 00:16:48.299]  The United States is giving China a chance to go ahead and come out and admit what happened here.
[00:16:48.939 --> 00:16:57.843]  And all the smart money was on this three weeks ago, and now that's where all the red flags, all the red arrows, all of the fingers are pointing.
[00:16:57.943 --> 00:17:03.726]  Is it China working on a vaccine to a bioweapon that's a live virus and it getting out?
[00:17:03.766 --> 00:17:09.689]  Wouldn't it be the first time that vaccine tests end up causing a pandemic or end up causing a major crisis?
[00:17:11.423 --> 00:17:19.626]  What we do know is this is very unusual and InfoWars is going to be here on air, cracking it all as it unfolds.
[00:17:19.687 --> 00:17:23.128]  And the Pentagon, as we told you three weeks ago, has shut up these emergency centers.
[00:17:23.568 --> 00:17:24.449]  Now that's all admitted.
[00:17:24.489 --> 00:17:25.509]  They're expanding those.
[00:17:26.029 --> 00:17:31.331]  And aggressive containment means if you have this virus, they're going to lock you up.
[00:17:33.852 --> 00:17:37.094]  Now, are they doing that to set the precedent to lock people up or is it because it's so deadly?
[00:17:37.844 --> 00:17:42.007]  Well, a lot of people said, well, we'll end up finding out because there'll be a bunch of deaths.
[00:17:42.987 --> 00:17:48.011]  No, when there's a real crisis, they tend to cover it up, not just our government, other governments.
[00:17:49.411 --> 00:17:51.493]  You know, it wasn't just the Russians that covered up Chernobyl.
[00:17:52.333 --> 00:17:54.975]  The 1950s, a huge reactor blew up in California.
[00:17:55.816 --> 00:17:57.317]  They didn't admit it till the 80s.
[00:17:58.437 --> 00:18:01.239]  And most estimates were worse than Chernobyl.
[00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.701]  But do Americans even know about that famous?
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:06.741]  Sodium reactor blowing up?
[00:18:06.841 --> 00:18:08.001]  No, you can look it up.
[00:18:09.202 --> 00:18:10.402]  America's Chernobyl.
[00:18:11.082 --> 00:18:11.843]  Just type that in.
[00:18:11.883 --> 00:18:12.443]  California.
[00:18:12.463 --> 00:18:14.684]  It wasn't Three Mile Island and some leakage.
[00:18:15.865 --> 00:18:18.906]  It was a reactor completely exploding like Chernobyl.
[00:18:22.193 --> 00:18:30.781]  So these governments and these corporations tend to cover things up, and that's why I was once a supporter of nuclear power, because if it's done right, it's a great thing.
[00:18:31.181 --> 00:18:35.645]  These companies and these CEOs just don't care, and they let everything fall apart and then melt down and blow up!
[00:18:38.007 --> 00:18:40.049]  And if you think that's bad, the military
[00:18:41.755 --> 00:18:47.557]  Runs a better ship with the nuclear submarines and the aircraft carriers, but you know, those have had disasters as well that have been swept under the rug.
[00:18:47.937 --> 00:18:52.178]  I know some of the people involved, some of the submarine captains that were involved in this.
[00:18:54.239 --> 00:18:56.700]  They were ordered to radiate their ships and test.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:59.141]  So, clearly, G.G.P.
[00:18:59.161 --> 00:19:05.863]  I mean, if you watch the people with what look like glorified leaf blowers coming in and spraying antiviral chemicals on people,
[00:19:08.476 --> 00:19:11.377]  This is what it's like to live in an authoritarian regime.
[00:19:11.397 --> 00:19:17.779]  Remember back in the 1950s, they said duck and cover for atomic attack from the Russians.
[00:19:18.019 --> 00:19:24.361]  And of course, getting under a desk isn't going to help you if the air raid sirens are going off in 15 minutes and ICBMs are coming in.
[00:19:30.003 --> 00:19:31.583]  But it creates that fear.
[00:19:34.925 --> 00:19:36.025]  And that's what it's really all about.
[00:19:37.179 --> 00:19:37.799]  Yeah, they found it.
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:38.260]  L.A.'
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:40.061]  's secret nuclear disaster.
[00:19:43.103 --> 00:19:45.125]  In fact, folks didn't even know there was a reactor there.
[00:19:46.326 --> 00:19:49.548]  Just like living here in Austin, there are two reactors.
[00:19:50.068 --> 00:19:51.850]  One under UT and one up at the J.J.
[00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:53.191]  Pickle Research Lab.
[00:19:53.471 --> 00:19:54.512]  That's not even secret!
[00:19:55.814 --> 00:19:59.635]  And I have Austinites walk up to me and go, I heard you say there's nuclear reactors in Austin.
[00:20:00.075 --> 00:20:00.735]  No, they're not.
[00:20:00.875 --> 00:20:03.375]  Because people just can't deal with the truth.
[00:20:04.096 --> 00:20:09.577]  Anything that scares them, they just say, it's a conspiracy theory, and they hope it all goes away.
[00:20:09.597 --> 00:20:20.039]  Well, I'll tell you this, one big bellwether is that we've had FEMA and different federal agencies try to buy up all the food from our sponsor, my Patriot Supply, and
[00:20:22.827 --> 00:20:27.299]  The orders have intensified the last week over what they were even three weeks ago.
[00:20:28.161 --> 00:20:29.565]  So they're still able to ship.
[00:20:30.967 --> 00:20:33.289]  Within 10 to 14 days, they have the food.
[00:20:33.329 --> 00:20:34.630]  They just have to package it and get it out.
[00:20:34.670 --> 00:20:35.570]  It's extremely fresh.
[00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:37.452]  They're working 24 hours a day.
[00:20:38.072 --> 00:20:42.255]  But I did talk to them again last night, and they said, Alex, we can hold it 10 to 14 days.
[00:20:42.735 --> 00:20:44.156]  Another week, maybe two.
[00:20:44.957 --> 00:20:48.199]  We're going to have to announce 14 to 21 days.
[00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:53.283]  And at a certain point, they're going to have to stop taking orders.
[00:20:53.343 --> 00:20:55.885]  They're getting to a point where they can't even get the food now.
[00:20:58.274 --> 00:21:04.618]  At an industrial scale to do this, and the other companies sold out immediately to corporations and the government when they call.
[00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:05.418]  Because that's easier.
[00:21:05.479 --> 00:21:07.340]  Oh, the government calls up, boom, you know, you sell out.
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:13.143]  The government's hoarding food right now, and sub-agencies are ordering food on top of the food they have.
[00:21:13.163 --> 00:21:15.725]  A lot of the government food's really old and crappy.
[00:21:16.065 --> 00:21:16.966]  Why are they doing that?
[00:21:17.776 --> 00:21:20.979]  Well, because they think this could get really serious and get out of control.
[00:21:21.479 --> 00:21:29.646]  Because 2020 is so crazy with the economy, and the wars, and the attempts at race war, and all the things that are going on, I think we're going to defeat the Globalist, at least in this round.
[00:21:30.567 --> 00:21:38.914]  But I've got storable food because it protects myself and my family, and it's one more variable that I can take out of the equation so that I know I'm covered.
[00:21:38.934 --> 00:21:41.035]  But I also need food to take care of my friends and my family.
[00:21:41.136 --> 00:21:43.698]  We've got, I don't know, three, four, five, six months of supply.
[00:21:43.718 --> 00:21:44.178]  I'm not sure.
[00:21:44.198 --> 00:21:44.799]  It's big.
[00:21:45.486 --> 00:21:50.752]  Here at my offices, where I have bought swearable food and water filtration and things like that for my crew.
[00:21:52.354 --> 00:21:55.017]  So that we could operate for months here if we needed to.
[00:21:55.157 --> 00:22:01.464]  And we have the firearms all locked up properly and folks that are trained to use them to protect ourselves.
[00:22:01.504 --> 00:22:04.527]  Because that's what an ant does, not a grasshopper.
[00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:06.792]  An ant is self-sufficient.
[00:22:06.832 --> 00:22:08.014]  An ant can go out and forage.
[00:22:08.034 --> 00:22:09.397]  An ant saves food for the winter.
[00:22:09.717 --> 00:22:11.120]  A grasshopper doesn't.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:15.387]  It's like the locusts all over Africa that just fly in, eat everything, and then flop over and die in the winter.
[00:22:15.787 --> 00:22:16.208]  The ants go on.
[00:22:17.924 --> 00:22:25.287]  I would take a cue from the ants and go to InfoWarsTore.com where they have month supplies, three month supplies, six month supplies, year supplies, special diets.
[00:22:25.807 --> 00:22:27.368]  And folks really have done taste tests.
[00:22:27.408 --> 00:22:29.029]  Even Vice tried to attack us.
[00:22:29.069 --> 00:22:30.329]  Said, let's test their food.
[00:22:30.349 --> 00:22:31.890]  They're like, that's really good macaroni.
[00:22:31.910 --> 00:22:32.710]  That's really good stew.
[00:22:33.511 --> 00:22:34.931]  Wait, this coffee's excellent.
[00:22:35.472 --> 00:22:35.772]  Yeah!
[00:22:36.857 --> 00:22:41.662]  I mean, I'm not calling the food gourmet, because you've got to pay four or five times that to get that really good camping gourmet food.
[00:22:41.682 --> 00:22:43.243]  There's stuff out there that's like, you know.
[00:22:43.524 --> 00:22:50.731]  But these are big bags of high quality, no fillers, at prices way lower than you're going to find anywhere, because it cuts out the middlemen, and it supports the info war.
[00:22:51.031 --> 00:23:00.521]  So take action now, because the food orders are going up, they're not going down, as it becomes more obvious that there's something really nasty and special about this virus.
[00:23:01.021 --> 00:23:08.243]  And there's a lot of other crazy things going on, so cover your bases, get your storable food at infowarestore.com while we still have it.
[00:23:08.323 --> 00:23:09.523]  Everybody else has sold out.
[00:23:11.903 --> 00:23:14.804]  Well, there it is at themightydrugsreport.com.
[00:23:14.824 --> 00:23:20.665]  McCabe will not face charges.
[00:23:22.406 --> 00:23:25.206]  That's right, they had reportedly had indictments out there.
[00:23:25.966 --> 00:23:28.027]  But the Justice Department can nix indictments.
[00:23:29.212 --> 00:23:38.539]  We're told the President shouldn't be able to nix indictments, but the almighty number two of the Justice Department has that power, because they're more important than the President.
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:45.325]  They're the permanent bureaucracy that's dug in and thinks they run this country.
[00:23:46.386 --> 00:23:47.046]  And here's the letter.
[00:23:47.827 --> 00:23:56.594]  We write to inform you that after careful consideration, the government has decided not to pursue criminal charges against your client, Andrew G. McCabe.
[00:23:58.106 --> 00:24:04.671]  Arising from the referral by the Office of the Inspector General to our Office on Conduct described in the report.
[00:24:06.392 --> 00:24:07.273]  And what did he do?
[00:24:07.513 --> 00:24:08.754]  All sorts of criminal activity.
[00:24:08.814 --> 00:24:09.694]  Lying to Congress.
[00:24:10.795 --> 00:24:11.816]  Leaking information.
[00:24:13.938 --> 00:24:14.898]  Spying on the President.
[00:24:14.958 --> 00:24:16.399]  Lying to the President saying he wasn't.
[00:24:16.459 --> 00:24:17.500]  I mean, it's just ridiculous.
[00:24:20.182 --> 00:24:22.604]  And so the swamp is flexing its tentacles.
[00:24:24.065 --> 00:24:25.086]  Its little alligator feet.
[00:24:26.181 --> 00:24:38.131]  A report of investigation of certain allegations related to former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, based on the totality of the circumstances and all of the information known, the government at this time, we consider the matter closed.
[00:24:38.191 --> 00:24:41.293]  Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.
[00:24:42.574 --> 00:24:44.256]  These are nice letters to get.
[00:24:44.936 --> 00:24:47.719]  I got one of these when they tried to plant child porn on us last year.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.802]  And the media was running around, I go, oh, here's my letter that I'm the victim.
[00:24:53.223 --> 00:24:54.084]  The case is closed.
[00:24:57.179 --> 00:24:58.740]  But that's not the case with this guy.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:03.444]  He got caught doing what he did absolutely directly.
[00:25:04.966 --> 00:25:18.678]  But you see, he did it under orders of Barack Hussein Obama, who before he left said Trump isn't legitimate, he's a Russian agent, we're going to put stay-behind money in place, we're going to block the delegates so that he doesn't get seated as the president at his inauguration.
[00:25:18.718 --> 00:25:19.278]  That failed.
[00:25:19.899 --> 00:25:23.622]  And then they said, oh, the intelligence agencies have six ways from Sunday to get you.
[00:25:24.861 --> 00:25:27.382]  And we've just seen these rogue groups.
[00:25:29.863 --> 00:25:32.304]  And if you want to know who these rogue groups are, watch Hollywood.
[00:25:33.024 --> 00:25:43.408]  The message of Hollywood is anti-God, anti-family, anti-father, anti-mother, anti-unborn, anti-Second Amendment, anti-everything.
[00:25:43.568 --> 00:25:51.631]  They're just a bunch of scum who want a weakened, demoralized America that can never come back from them selling us out.
[00:25:52.231 --> 00:25:53.012]  It's disgusting.
[00:25:54.033 --> 00:26:08.188]  So the Rachel Maddows and the Chuckie Schumers and the Hillary Clintons can just have their way with us, generation after generation, passing the power on to each other as a plutocracy, an oligarchy.
[00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:10.970]  Yeah, in fact, cue that up with audio.
[00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.991]  Remember, it was a few months ago.
[00:26:12.692 --> 00:26:14.814]  Brennan is up there with the former CIA director.
[00:26:15.745 --> 00:26:18.746]  McLaughlin, and they go, thank God for the deep state.
[00:26:19.186 --> 00:26:25.288]  We're going to show this president who's boss, we have the intelligence agencies and the intelligence committee, and we're going to remove him.
[00:26:25.549 --> 00:26:29.610]  And Brennan literally makes like a serial killer face.
[00:26:31.711 --> 00:26:32.711]  Like a psycho gorilla.
[00:26:33.751 --> 00:26:37.313]  They're all bowing down to him.
[00:26:39.253 --> 00:26:42.715]  You're watching baboons come to the head baboon and kiss its hand and our chimpanzees.
[00:26:43.035 --> 00:26:43.515]  I mean, he's
[00:26:48.669 --> 00:26:59.755]  I mean, that's who some old communist jerk-off, piece of crap, gets up in front of Congress with a clapper and says, we've never spied on anyone now!
[00:26:59.775 --> 00:27:00.075]  A U.S.
[00:27:00.095 --> 00:27:01.416]  citizen's never been spied on!
[00:27:01.636 --> 00:27:02.536]  Not one time!
[00:27:04.777 --> 00:27:06.198]  Because they don't call it spying.
[00:27:06.218 --> 00:27:07.199]  It's like, Trump's wrong.
[00:27:07.239 --> 00:27:08.079]  We never wiretapped him.
[00:27:08.299 --> 00:27:09.440]  They haven't called it that in 30 years.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:11.941]  It's electronic intercepts.
[00:27:15.463 --> 00:27:17.184]  Yeah, so let's play the video of
[00:27:19.778 --> 00:27:23.480]  Of them on C-SPAN celebrating when they were starting the impeachment.
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.441]  And they're like, we're gonna get him, yeah!
[00:27:27.582 --> 00:27:32.424]  And Brennan literally goes, everyone, I'm tired.
[00:27:32.785 --> 00:27:35.906]  And he walks around Congress and stuff when he's there, just everyone's scared.
[00:27:35.926 --> 00:27:40.648]  He walks around just, can you imagine as a full grown man walking around like this?
[00:27:40.688 --> 00:27:41.529]  You scared of me?
[00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:45.331]  I'm a bureaucrat and it's my government.
[00:27:49.462 --> 00:27:52.142]  I mean, you know, that's a certifiable lunatic right there.
[00:27:53.023 --> 00:27:54.863]  Couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag.
[00:27:56.303 --> 00:27:59.184]  But he can piss down America's back forever.
[00:27:59.764 --> 00:28:02.184]  All I want is to get these dishonorable scumbags out of there.
[00:28:02.444 --> 00:28:04.465]  Things won't be perfect, but they'll be a hell of a lot better.
[00:28:04.785 --> 00:28:09.065]  If you hate America and you were in the Communist Party, you shouldn't be the CIA director.
[00:28:09.585 --> 00:28:11.326]  Yeah, no, he voted Communist twice.
[00:28:11.826 --> 00:28:13.986]  Because he's a sack of filth.
[00:28:15.646 --> 00:28:17.047]  And everyone's so scared of him.
[00:28:17.107 --> 00:28:18.847]  He better be scared of God Almighty.
[00:28:24.073 --> 00:28:31.019]  So, let's watch he and another CIA director celebrate how they are God.
[00:28:31.059 --> 00:28:31.579]  Here it is.
[00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:39.186]  President's concern and often used term about a deep state being there to take him out.
[00:28:39.206 --> 00:28:41.408]  Well, you know, thank God for the deep state.
[00:28:45.351 --> 00:28:58.998]  I mean, I think, you know, everyone here has seen this progression of diplomats and intelligence officers and White House people trooping up to Capitol Hill right now and saying, these are people who are doing their duty or responding to a higher call.
[00:28:59.898 --> 00:29:01.639]  A higher call that you run the country.
[00:29:02.039 --> 00:29:06.422]  So, Valentine's Day at the DOJ, even before Drudge said that, I saw the obviousness of it.
[00:29:06.982 --> 00:29:08.563]  This is a little Valentine gift.
[00:29:09.043 --> 00:29:10.824]  Could it get any more homoerotic?
[00:29:12.892 --> 00:29:15.654]  From Bill Barr to his little cupcake, he goes, here you go, sweetie.
[00:29:16.034 --> 00:29:18.556]  It's not about sex, Gary, now get on your knees.
[00:29:24.319 --> 00:29:29.402]  You know that there's no way they're ever going to fix any of this, though.
[00:29:30.283 --> 00:29:36.307]  The bureaucracy can hang on, like I said yesterday, like an insect right before it dies before winter.
[00:29:37.403 --> 00:29:43.146]  That big blue noiler comes down and they're gonna just be detached and sucked off into the vortex of history.
[00:29:44.767 --> 00:29:52.191]  Because that's the way it works for these bureaucracies and their ineptitude and their arrogance and just how soft and bug-eyed they are.
[00:29:52.211 --> 00:29:56.353]  I mean, Strzok and Page, those are chicken necks!
[00:29:56.933 --> 00:30:05.678]  And they go and they get their degree and they become FBI agents and then they're political frauds so they get promoted up the chain of command and everyone has to bow down to them.
[00:30:08.865 --> 00:30:13.968]  It's disgusting, but it's got to be dealt with.
[00:30:14.048 --> 00:30:23.853]  And if you want to judge a tree by its fruits, Bill Barr has presided over the cover-up of the Jeffrey Epstein saga.
[00:30:26.995 --> 00:30:34.119]  Now, because Trump is cracking down on the pedophile rings all over the world, and because Barr's been doing some of that as well, I'll give the benefit of the doubt for a little bit longer.
[00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:39.552]  That they're just busy getting their ducks in a row, but we need action.
[00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:43.414]  We need action.
[00:30:44.454 --> 00:30:46.895]  We know Hillary has blackmail information.
[00:30:47.215 --> 00:30:49.456]  We know she's threatening thousands of prominent people.
[00:30:52.758 --> 00:30:56.059]  We need some of those prominent people to give a press conference and say, look, I didn't know what I was doing.
[00:30:56.419 --> 00:30:58.040]  She looked like she was 20, she was 16.
[00:30:58.460 --> 00:31:00.001]  As soon as I did it, they said they owned me.
[00:31:00.441 --> 00:31:01.902]  And then the whole house of cards comes down.
[00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:10.373]  I've never done anything like that, but if somebody was trying to blackmail me with something like that, I would do a press conference.
[00:31:12.535 --> 00:31:15.576]  And that's what they did, ladies and gentlemen, and then it only began there.
[00:31:16.857 --> 00:31:23.381]  And so, this is how our country is held hostage by a pervert network.
[00:31:24.802 --> 00:31:31.066]  And again, people ask, why would MS-13 go kidnap a teenager and torture him to death for Satan to become a member of MS-13?
[00:31:31.366 --> 00:31:32.827]  Because the worst thing you can do is serve Satan.
[00:31:33.826 --> 00:31:37.248]  And if you can get people to pledge themselves to Satan, they'll think there's no going back at that point.
[00:31:37.528 --> 00:31:41.970]  So, so many organized gangs have Satanism involved and have killing of innocents involved.
[00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:44.051]  Well, you think MS-13 just invented that?
[00:31:44.531 --> 00:31:44.711]  No.
[00:31:45.211 --> 00:31:54.315]  With these globalist mafias, it's devil worship, it's underage sex, then it's pedophilia, then it's, hey, we gotta get rid of these kids.
[00:31:55.376 --> 00:31:57.917]  Go down there and hack them up with a machete in the basement.
[00:31:58.868 --> 00:32:00.789]  You're like, but I'm a banking CEO!
[00:32:01.049 --> 00:32:01.690]  Hey, listen!
[00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:05.873]  You're gonna go kill that five-year-old with this machete, or you and your wife are dead!
[00:32:07.273 --> 00:32:11.476]  You wanted to be part of the club, now you are!
[00:32:12.757 --> 00:32:13.457]  See how it works?
[00:32:14.618 --> 00:32:16.499]  Keep the babies comfortable.
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:19.221]  That's who these people are.
[00:32:19.722 --> 00:32:21.182]  And it's time to call their bluff.
[00:32:22.623 --> 00:32:22.904]  I see.
[00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:30.312]  It's time for people to stop having fear and realize the sword of truth is invincible when used.
[00:32:32.872 --> 00:32:48.436]  The answer to 1984 is... You know, the fellow that told me that, like, 15 years ago,
[00:32:53.476 --> 00:32:55.737]  I didn't even know who he was at the time, and he died right after.
[00:32:58.478 --> 00:33:01.839]  Was like one of the most famous modern economists ever in the UK.
[00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:09.301]  And he said, the answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:33:09.541 --> 00:33:13.823]  And then later I put a clip of him in one of my films.
[00:33:13.843 --> 00:33:14.963]  People go, you don't know who that is?
[00:33:16.124 --> 00:33:17.304]  And I called to get him on as a guest.
[00:33:17.344 --> 00:33:19.445]  He was dead by then, but pretty powerful.
[00:33:20.842 --> 00:33:23.304]  I did not coin that, but I certainly popularized it.
[00:33:27.027 --> 00:33:29.470]  Okay, here's what's going to happen, folks.
[00:33:32.592 --> 00:33:36.215]  I was pretty euphoric to see Trump firing hundreds and hundreds of deep staters.
[00:33:37.196 --> 00:33:40.099]  And they keep telling him, don't do that and we'll be nice.
[00:33:40.639 --> 00:33:44.262]  But he's learned they only attack more, so he's finally firing a whole bunch of them.
[00:33:45.083 --> 00:33:48.146]  And now the Justice Department is showing its true colors, bar.
[00:33:49.557 --> 00:33:52.500]  As a shot across the bow, came out and said, you shouldn't tweet.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.201]  You should lay down and take it.
[00:33:54.441 --> 00:33:57.724]  You shouldn't say something's a kangaroo court, or it's a kangaroo impeachment.
[00:33:57.964 --> 00:33:58.705]  You should take it!
[00:33:59.226 --> 00:34:00.727]  Presidents aren't allowed to talk!
[00:34:02.649 --> 00:34:04.791]  The average citizen has that power, but not a president.
[00:34:06.252 --> 00:34:10.415]  And people are like, oh, Barr, you know, he's, he's working with the president.
[00:34:10.456 --> 00:34:12.878]  He knows he's under attack, so it's a cover story, you know?
[00:34:13.178 --> 00:34:13.979]  Q says so.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:15.380]  Maybe.
[00:34:18.868 --> 00:34:26.029]  But now Andrew McCabe, who leaked, lied to Congress, spied on the President, lied to the President, did all this illegal crap.
[00:34:27.350 --> 00:34:29.230]  He just got a Valentine's Day.
[00:34:31.371 --> 00:34:32.791]  Rogerport.com gets it right.
[00:34:33.411 --> 00:34:35.431]  Oh, a Justice Department Valentine's Day.
[00:34:35.471 --> 00:34:36.512]  How disgusting.
[00:34:39.212 --> 00:34:43.313]  Just like they started the impeachment on Friday the 13th against the President.
[00:34:50.817 --> 00:34:53.879]  So, that tells you everything you need to know, and I'm going to tell you something.
[00:34:54.059 --> 00:34:55.620]  I've not seen any action.
[00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:56.861]  None.
[00:35:00.103 --> 00:35:03.585]  Against the Epstein-Clinton pedophile rings.
[00:35:06.326 --> 00:35:11.930]  And you notice, the deep state just keeps trying to remove Trump, trying to block him, harass his supporters.
[00:35:14.909 --> 00:35:20.313]  And then Trump sits up there in glad hands with Barr, who comes out and slides a knife right into his back.
[00:35:21.153 --> 00:35:21.954]  Hell, not into his back.
[00:35:22.995 --> 00:35:31.741]  Barr walks right over and says, you shouldn't be tweeting about what judges and courts are doing.
[00:35:32.041 --> 00:35:36.224]  Really, the same judges that said he can't control the border, and the Supreme Court ruled every time he was right?
[00:35:37.145 --> 00:35:37.825]  BS, man.
[00:35:38.145 --> 00:35:41.428]  They're attacking the president in full time, and they want him to shut up.
[00:35:42.554 --> 00:35:49.278]  And let the bureaucracy come in and come together with a consensus every week of what he's supposed to do and be a kept president.
[00:35:50.199 --> 00:36:08.209]  And until he does that, like he's some Mandarin Chinese emperor in the Forbidden City, until he binds his feet and grows four foot long fingernails, and because you're so royal you can't even, your majesty, you can't wipe your own arse or eat your own food, you're so royal!
[00:36:08.529 --> 00:36:09.470]  You don't walk!
[00:36:10.646 --> 00:36:13.809]  And they had the priest go, look how beautiful your bound feet are, princess.
[00:36:14.389 --> 00:36:16.230]  They'd be all deformed, a woman can't even walk.
[00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:30.581]  But, the power behind the throne, the legalist, that the Chaikoms come out of, for 3,000 years they had control of Chinese dynasties, telling them, you are the elite.
[00:36:31.582 --> 00:36:33.503]  And you aren't allowed to talk to the public.
[00:36:33.664 --> 00:36:34.884]  You're not allowed to feed yourself.
[00:36:35.085 --> 00:36:36.386]  You're not allowed to wipe your own ass.
[00:36:37.827 --> 00:36:39.048]  They were really prisoners.
[00:36:40.325 --> 00:36:43.048]  And other royal groups learned how to make royalty prisoners.
[00:36:44.889 --> 00:36:46.771]  Did you know the Queen of England doesn't wipe her own ass?
[00:36:48.212 --> 00:36:50.755]  She has someone called the Groom of the Stool.
[00:36:54.118 --> 00:36:54.818]  I'm not joking.
[00:36:55.779 --> 00:36:57.241]  And I'm not trying to be gross here.
[00:36:57.881 --> 00:36:58.181]  You see...
[00:36:59.161 --> 00:37:00.922]  The globalists are doing that to the public.
[00:37:00.982 --> 00:37:02.322]  There are no men, there are no women.
[00:37:02.562 --> 00:37:03.463]  We don't want to be strong.
[00:37:03.503 --> 00:37:04.303]  Don't challenge people.
[00:37:04.343 --> 00:37:11.806]  Get rid of the F to A scoring system, because F's will hurt someone's feelings and everybody gets a participation trophy.
[00:37:13.427 --> 00:37:15.587]  But see, then the trophies don't mean anything anymore, do they?
[00:37:15.667 --> 00:37:17.488]  Because they're not real.
[00:37:18.729 --> 00:37:20.549]  Best thing ever happened to me was adversity.
[00:37:20.629 --> 00:37:21.930]  Thank God.
[00:37:25.219 --> 00:37:27.720]  That racist gangs brutalized me in Dallas.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.180]  It was the best thing that ever happened to me.
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:30.680]  I love it.
[00:37:31.981 --> 00:37:33.581]  Because it activated my genes.
[00:37:33.601 --> 00:37:35.542]  It activated who I was as a man.
[00:37:35.602 --> 00:37:36.362]  Made me strong.
[00:37:36.802 --> 00:37:37.742]  Made me learn to fight.
[00:37:38.282 --> 00:37:40.823]  Thank God I was on the tail end of back when people still fought.
[00:37:41.283 --> 00:37:42.523]  And still went out and did stuff.
[00:37:42.583 --> 00:37:44.044]  And you know, it's sad sometimes.
[00:37:44.804 --> 00:37:49.807]  You know, your kid dies in a gang fight or whatever, but it's better than living as a slave their whole life.
[00:37:50.247 --> 00:37:53.849]  A little victim jellyfish that goes around like, I'm a victim!
[00:37:54.870 --> 00:37:55.810]  Take care of me!
[00:37:56.431 --> 00:37:58.592]  And they go, oh, you're part of this group now.
[00:37:59.032 --> 00:37:59.973]  Come be part of this group.
[00:38:00.813 --> 00:38:03.315]  And as a collective, we're going to take care of each other.
[00:38:03.335 --> 00:38:05.496]  But that's never really how it works, is it?
[00:38:06.940 --> 00:38:10.623]  So this is all bigger than Roger Stone, bigger than Donald Trump, bigger than InfoWars.
[00:38:10.903 --> 00:38:17.828]  If they can silence all of us, if they can silence you, if they can persecute people and scare everyone to submit, they think they're going to win.
[00:38:18.269 --> 00:38:27.556]  That's why it's critical to not just act like you're not afraid, but have the joy of battle and love this fight and love the honor of being able to engage these maggots.
[00:38:29.177 --> 00:38:30.998]  Greg Reese has put out a very powerful report.
[00:38:31.218 --> 00:38:34.481]  Stacked jury of the kangaroo court against Roger Stone must end.
[00:38:34.901 --> 00:38:35.602]  Here is his report.
[00:38:37.526 --> 00:38:41.868]  A kangaroo court is a court that ignores law and justice.
[00:38:42.969 --> 00:38:49.412]  They are held to give the appearance of a fair trial, while the verdict has been decided from the start.
[00:38:51.913 --> 00:38:59.217]  On Friday, January 25th, 2019, the FBI arrested Roger Stone in his home.
[00:39:00.538 --> 00:39:05.260]  CNN showed up moments before to capture it all in its drama.
[00:39:07.486 --> 00:39:11.489]  This was important, because Roger Stone did nothing wrong.
[00:39:12.430 --> 00:39:19.915]  The allegation was that he was seeking stolen emails from Wikileaks that could damage Trump's opponents.
[00:39:21.276 --> 00:39:24.699]  And even if this were true, it is no crime.
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:32.325]  So they make the arrest look like he was Al Capone, because the lie is all they have left.
[00:39:34.850 --> 00:39:41.174]  We know the judge assigned to the case has a political motivation to prosecute Roger Stone.
[00:39:42.815 --> 00:39:57.225]  With all of the corporate mockingbird media against him, Judge Amy Berman Jackson imposed a gag order on Roger Stone, banning him from discussing his case in public, including on social media.
[00:39:58.553 --> 00:40:05.177]  And if that wasn't clear enough, Judge Berman Jackson made it absolutely clear during jury selection.
[00:40:05.437 --> 00:40:07.738]  Her judgments have been transparently political.
[00:40:07.778 --> 00:40:22.087]  Yesterday, for example, during jury selection, one of the prospective jurors turned out to be a former press secretary in the Obama administration who admitted that she despises Donald Trump and has friends in the federal prosecutor's office, which is trying the case.
[00:40:22.927 --> 00:40:26.609]  Her husband, meanwhile, works at the Justice Department, which is prosecuting Roger Stone.
[00:40:27.270 --> 00:40:38.176]  The woman claimed she had followed the Mueller investigation closely, but somehow had never, quote, read or heard anything about Roger Stone's case and didn't have a strong opinion about it.
[00:40:38.856 --> 00:40:38.996]  Uh-huh.
[00:40:39.757 --> 00:40:42.118]  No sober person could take that claim seriously.
[00:40:42.598 --> 00:40:44.139]  But Amy Berman Jackson did.
[00:40:44.159 --> 00:40:47.081]  She acted like it was all completely fine and on the level.
[00:40:47.844 --> 00:40:53.686]  When Roger Stone's lawyers asked that that woman be removed from the jury pool, Jackson refused.
[00:40:54.327 --> 00:40:58.548]  Personal conflicts, she said, were, quote, not automatically disqualifying.
[00:40:59.689 --> 00:41:04.751]  Even the jury felt compelled to reveal itself as anti-Trump activists.
[00:41:06.271 --> 00:41:13.554]  Juror Seth Cousins wrote an article for the Washington Post exposing himself as an anti-Trump activist.
[00:41:15.310 --> 00:41:19.972]  And now, juror Tamika Hart has revealed herself as well.
[00:41:21.712 --> 00:41:31.796]  After CNN exposed her identity, journalist Mike Cernovich pointed out her clear political bias on social media, before she could delete it.
[00:41:33.636 --> 00:41:34.737]  Kangaroo Court.
[00:41:36.017 --> 00:41:43.380]  The Russian collusion fell apart months ago, and somehow, Roger Stone's made-up crimes still stand?
[00:41:45.143 --> 00:41:48.865]  One would think that President Trump would have already pardoned him by now.
[00:41:49.986 --> 00:41:51.587]  Never leave a man behind.
[00:41:52.427 --> 00:41:54.928]  We cannot leave behind Roger Stone.
[00:41:55.989 --> 00:41:59.791]  And we cannot leave behind General Michael Thomas Flynn.
[00:42:01.272 --> 00:42:04.394]  And we cannot leave behind Julian Assange.
[00:42:06.175 --> 00:42:07.956]  These men did nothing wrong.
[00:42:08.856 --> 00:42:13.679]  And their continued persecution is only proof of a corrupt system.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.142]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:42:32.244 --> 00:42:33.485]  And everyone was scared to say it.
[00:42:33.645 --> 00:42:34.506]  We said it first.
[00:42:34.606 --> 00:42:35.146]  We put it out.
[00:42:35.186 --> 00:42:36.708]  Tucker Carlson picked it up to his credit.
[00:42:37.008 --> 00:42:41.151]  I'm just pointing out while we're under attack, here's the Washington Post from three months ago.
[00:42:41.311 --> 00:42:43.793]  Alex Jones threatened to name a Roger Stone juror.
[00:42:44.213 --> 00:42:46.455]  Experts say he might be jury tampering.
[00:42:46.875 --> 00:42:47.976]  Well, I didn't threaten to name him.
[00:42:48.076 --> 00:42:48.557]  I named him.
[00:42:49.687 --> 00:42:51.487]  Piss up a rope, you thugs!
[00:42:52.308 --> 00:42:52.888]  Go to hell!
[00:42:53.428 --> 00:42:55.168]  Alex Jones threatened to out the juror.
[00:42:55.469 --> 00:42:57.429]  You don't out jurors when they're Democrat operatives.
[00:42:58.009 --> 00:43:00.390]  They had to step down because it was a conflict of interest.
[00:43:00.910 --> 00:43:02.630]  And now we learn more of the jurors were the same.
[00:43:02.951 --> 00:43:04.931]  Piss up a rope, scum!
[00:43:07.072 --> 00:43:08.292]  Welcome back, Alex Jones here.
[00:43:09.732 --> 00:43:12.173]  Dr. Steve Pachinick is really worried.
[00:43:12.193 --> 00:43:15.014]  He's got an emergency message from the President coming up in about 15 minutes.
[00:43:16.075 --> 00:43:22.079]  They're more afraid of Trump being president than anything else because he is the president and he's not doing what bureaucrats tell him.
[00:43:23.079 --> 00:43:25.601]  You can agree with what he says, disagree, it's a mix.
[00:43:26.301 --> 00:43:26.842]  For me at least.
[00:43:28.443 --> 00:43:38.429]  But the fact that he is trying to be the president, and with every passing day, every passing week and month and year, he becomes the president more, that's what scares them the most.
[00:43:39.468 --> 00:43:47.716]  And so the fact that he's saying he's probably going to pardon Stone, the fact that he's saying the sentencing is outrageous, they're like, how dare you involve yourself in things?
[00:43:47.817 --> 00:43:49.498]  Anybody else can write a letter to the judge.
[00:43:50.139 --> 00:43:51.741]  Anybody else can say this is BS.
[00:43:53.182 --> 00:43:55.965]  When this Travis County indicted Rick Perry for nothing.
[00:43:57.106 --> 00:44:01.470]  I've got problems with Rick Perry, but Rick Perry did not do anything when he vetoed a bill.
[00:44:02.011 --> 00:44:02.552]  They called that
[00:44:03.544 --> 00:44:04.024]  Corruption.
[00:44:04.725 --> 00:44:08.327]  That's in the legislative power to veto a bill Democrats wanted passed.
[00:44:08.708 --> 00:44:09.368]  Money they wanted.
[00:44:11.129 --> 00:44:15.432]  When the head of the agency got caught doing corrupt stuff, he said, fire the head of that agency, I'm gonna veto that money.
[00:44:16.253 --> 00:44:16.833]  They didn't do it.
[00:44:17.193 --> 00:44:17.754]  They indicted him.
[00:44:17.794 --> 00:44:20.896]  Took him two years and over two million dollars to beat that.
[00:44:21.737 --> 00:44:23.097]  And that's the tactic.
[00:44:23.157 --> 00:44:24.719]  They don't want governors being governors.
[00:44:25.179 --> 00:44:26.720]  They don't want presidents being presidents.
[00:44:26.740 --> 00:44:28.781]  They don't want fathers being fathers, mothers being mothers.
[00:44:29.202 --> 00:44:30.923]  They're assaulting reality.
[00:44:32.401 --> 00:44:34.022]  And I'll talk about that at the start of the next segment.
[00:44:34.483 --> 00:44:36.464]  Some other news I haven't gotten to that needs to be covered.
[00:44:38.025 --> 00:44:50.955]  But you got Nancy Pelosi and Eric Swallowswell and others just out there again acting like the President tweeting is bad and now the Attorney General is agreeing it's bad.
[00:44:51.335 --> 00:44:53.877]  But see, Trump's not supposed to fire the Deep State.
[00:44:54.457 --> 00:44:56.659]  And now McCabe's been told he's not in trouble.
[00:44:56.679 --> 00:45:00.542]  So this is a real Justice Department rebellion against the President right now.
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:03.321]  And Trump has all the cards.
[00:45:03.401 --> 00:45:05.782]  Barr has been involved covering up the Epstein thing.
[00:45:06.962 --> 00:45:12.504]  I've seen no evidence Trump's involved in that, but it's still very suspicious that nothing's being done on that front.
[00:45:12.984 --> 00:45:16.026]  So here's what Pelosi had to say, and then we'll play what Swalwell said.
[00:45:17.926 --> 00:45:25.649]  We also saw the president this week demonstrate once again that he has no respect for the rule of law.
[00:45:26.109 --> 00:45:29.911]  His assault on the rule of law by engaging in political interference in the Senate
[00:45:30.530 --> 00:45:31.671]  And the President is what he is.
[00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:57.771]  He thinks he's above the law.
[00:45:57.911 --> 00:45:59.252]  He has no respect for the rule.
[00:45:59.452 --> 00:46:06.138]  But where are the Republicans to speak out on this blatant violation of the rule of law?
[00:46:06.799 --> 00:46:07.059]  A.G.
[00:46:07.119 --> 00:46:20.370]  Barr has deeply damaged the rule of law by withdrawing the DOJ's sentencing recommendation, the act of interference, and Trump's retribution against lead attorney in the Stone case.
[00:46:20.570 --> 00:46:22.792]  Imagine that four of the prosecutors
[00:46:23.558 --> 00:46:24.139]  Classical, this.
[00:46:24.179 --> 00:46:25.101]  They didn't even talk.
[00:46:25.121 --> 00:46:25.361]  Vindman, oh!
[00:46:34.875 --> 00:46:40.716]  The American people must have confidence in our nation's system of impartial justice.
[00:46:41.857 --> 00:46:46.678]  And with the withdrawal of the four career prosecutors of the case, what an act of courage on their part.
[00:46:46.718 --> 00:46:47.738]  It must be commended.
[00:46:48.058 --> 00:46:49.319]  You know, I'm going to do everybody a favor.
[00:46:50.019 --> 00:46:52.599]  I'm not going to make you listen to her anymore, or Swallow as well.
[00:46:52.619 --> 00:46:54.800]  But maybe in post we'll put it out.
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:46:55.820]  We post this to InfoWars.
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:58.401]  But, truly disgusting.
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:01.121]  Man, she's hard to listen to and hard to watch.
[00:47:01.881 --> 00:47:04.322]  And everything they say Trump's doing, they've done.
[00:47:04.942 --> 00:47:12.506]  The truth is, Trump's gotten a lot done on policy that's direct, where he can order a policy and see it happen.
[00:47:12.866 --> 00:47:14.947]  But when it comes to bureaucracy, he can't get anything done.
[00:47:14.987 --> 00:47:19.369]  These people do whatever they want, and they have paralyzed the President.
[00:47:20.669 --> 00:47:21.450]  That's what this is.
[00:47:22.650 --> 00:47:24.071]  Oh, you want to talk about a pardon?
[00:47:24.091 --> 00:47:24.871]  That's illegal!
[00:47:25.211 --> 00:47:25.772]  No, it's not!
[00:47:25.992 --> 00:47:28.693]  It's in the damn Constitution, you ugly demon witch!
[00:47:30.424 --> 00:47:31.725]  And by ugly, I don't mean physically.
[00:47:31.765 --> 00:47:33.046]  I mean, she's an ugly soul.
[00:47:34.207 --> 00:47:37.190]  A gibbering edifice that's collapsing, thank God.
[00:47:37.230 --> 00:47:37.791]  We'll be right back.
[00:47:39.712 --> 00:47:41.194]  But it's gone from your eyes.
[00:47:45.257 --> 00:47:54.746]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, on this Valentine's Day, Friday, February 14th, 2020.
[00:47:57.244 --> 00:48:03.808]  And there's no place I'd rather be than here with you, covering these important topics and trying to promote a pro-human future.
[00:48:09.011 --> 00:48:09.891]  Well, a lot's happened.
[00:48:10.752 --> 00:48:19.457]  And we were all wondering, only a week ago, when the president was exonerated yet again, what would the new canard be?
[00:48:19.537 --> 00:48:21.438]  What would the new fiasco be?
[00:48:21.478 --> 00:48:22.599]  What would the new hoax be?
[00:48:23.739 --> 00:48:24.760]  What would the new fraud be?
[00:48:26.812 --> 00:48:31.495]  And it's why he thinks that the judge is out of control.
[00:48:33.477 --> 00:48:36.719]  But presidents have always fought with the courts and judges and fought with Congress.
[00:48:36.739 --> 00:48:37.380]  That's normal.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:42.683]  That's what the three different branches of government fight with each other so that you don't ever get one unified system.
[00:48:42.703 --> 00:48:46.486]  But see, oh, the president's supposed to just do whatever the bureaucracy says.
[00:48:47.387 --> 00:48:54.552]  And now the former acting FBI director, who was involved in the leaking to Congress and spying on the president and lying about it and all of it,
[00:48:55.663 --> 00:48:57.864]  He got a Valentine's Day card.
[00:48:57.884 --> 00:49:01.846]  I mean, these lawyers at the Justice Department make me sad.
[00:49:04.067 --> 00:49:06.769]  You know, their candy asses have been planning that for a while.
[00:49:07.189 --> 00:49:10.851]  And so Trump wouldn't criticize, Barr came out and hit him right up front.
[00:49:10.871 --> 00:49:13.612]  Because now they've got Trump where they want him.
[00:49:15.913 --> 00:49:20.896]  Now they've gotten him to open up and trust Barr and everybody, and boy, now they can carve him up real good.
[00:49:22.585 --> 00:49:23.945]  At least they think they might be able to.
[00:49:24.266 --> 00:49:30.067]  Some will say, oh Barr did this, you know, he's under pressure from the Democrats to make it look like, you know, he's not under Trump's control.
[00:49:30.267 --> 00:49:30.728]  Whatever!
[00:49:32.268 --> 00:49:33.348]  It's all the same thing.
[00:49:33.468 --> 00:49:34.689]  A bunch of lawyers.
[00:49:39.550 --> 00:49:40.951]  So Dr. Steve Pacheco is joining us.
[00:49:43.188 --> 00:49:46.370]  The facts are in about Barr and the cover-up of Epstein.
[00:49:46.731 --> 00:49:47.811]  You can say what you want.
[00:49:47.931 --> 00:49:49.192]  Maybe he's going to turn that around.
[00:49:49.232 --> 00:49:49.913]  I hope he does.
[00:49:50.914 --> 00:49:51.734]  I want to fix things.
[00:49:51.794 --> 00:49:58.519]  But you have a dug-in bureaucracy that believes it has a right to rule over everyone and that it owns you and your family.
[00:50:01.261 --> 00:50:02.582]  And so this is the new scandal.
[00:50:02.762 --> 00:50:03.763]  Chuckie Schumer, all of them.
[00:50:03.823 --> 00:50:05.184]  We want to remove the president.
[00:50:05.344 --> 00:50:10.528]  He's obstructing justice in the Roger Stone case that has nothing to do with Russia.
[00:50:11.368 --> 00:50:12.109]  Totally made up.
[00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:16.023]  Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin has come out.
[00:50:19.047 --> 00:50:22.612]  Hard to believe you got to say this in 2020, but you have to defend it.
[00:50:23.273 --> 00:50:26.757]  As long as I'm president, we will have mother and father.
[00:50:27.158 --> 00:50:29.842]  Putin backs traditional family values once again.
[00:50:31.425 --> 00:50:32.066]  Well, look at this.
[00:50:32.426 --> 00:50:37.070]  Female runners file suit to bar trans males from girls' sports.
[00:50:37.590 --> 00:50:51.663]  All over the United States and Europe, biological men in wrestling, in boxing, in track and field, the 100-yard dash, pole vaulting, are dominating women.
[00:50:53.649 --> 00:50:59.514]  Now in any other place in time, men competing against women are creeps, are jerks, are weirdos.
[00:50:59.634 --> 00:51:00.715]  It's a joke.
[00:51:00.775 --> 00:51:01.475]  No one does it.
[00:51:01.495 --> 00:51:04.357]  So they'll think, oh, you fight like a girl.
[00:51:05.118 --> 00:51:16.807]  But see, in this new upside-down world, if a guy gets in the ring and says he's a woman and breaks a woman's jaw, why, he's the bravest athlete in history is what they said.
[00:51:17.788 --> 00:51:19.970]  Now a man beating up a woman
[00:51:22.463 --> 00:51:24.304]  Is the bravest thing in history.
[00:51:24.364 --> 00:51:24.865]  That's the quote.
[00:51:26.546 --> 00:51:28.487]  Now, everybody knows that's inversion of reality.
[00:51:31.250 --> 00:51:33.351]  And it's ruining the sports, but that's what it's all about.
[00:51:33.731 --> 00:51:38.075]  Men coming in and aggressively pishing all over female spaces.
[00:51:39.295 --> 00:51:39.956]  And vice versa.
[00:51:40.636 --> 00:51:42.898]  Breaking down any privacy that's left.
[00:51:43.298 --> 00:51:44.599]  That you're a woman.
[00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:45.680]  I'm a man.
[00:51:46.861 --> 00:51:50.784]  No, you want to get some big dude
[00:51:52.861 --> 00:51:56.124]  Who's got testosterone and everything.
[00:51:58.185 --> 00:52:01.708]  And then he's gonna beat women at cycling and go up and get the gold medal.
[00:52:01.968 --> 00:52:04.550]  And then the women are all supposed to sit there and play along with it.
[00:52:04.791 --> 00:52:09.795]  And any woman that complains gets ostracized and loses her job and gets attacked by a bunch of bullies.
[00:52:10.215 --> 00:52:10.735]  A cult!
[00:52:13.618 --> 00:52:17.501]  Biological male runner to compete in USA Women's Olympic Trials.
[00:52:19.281 --> 00:52:19.901]  What a joke!
[00:52:20.541 --> 00:52:26.883]  If you catch a man taking more testosterone, why, they lose their gold medals like Lance Armstrong.
[00:52:27.263 --> 00:52:38.865]  But if you're a man competing against women, who's got 30, 40 times the testosterone of a woman over his test, well then it's okay.
[00:52:38.925 --> 00:52:39.885]  I mean, look at this.
[00:52:40.525 --> 00:52:43.846]  I mean, if you're watching this on TV, these are big dudes.
[00:52:45.267 --> 00:52:49.749]  Now, they couldn't actually win against alpha males, but it doesn't matter.
[00:52:49.769 --> 00:52:50.610]  They're bullies.
[00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.911]  They're jerks.
[00:52:52.771 --> 00:52:53.411]  They're gross.
[00:52:55.933 --> 00:52:57.974]  And this is the mental illness of the globalists.
[00:52:58.314 --> 00:53:09.300]  They think if they can make us accept huge dudes, two feet taller than women, running over them in basketball, running over them in soccer, running over them in rugby,
[00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:28.954]  It's just as insane as if I said, I identify as a seven-year-old in Pop Warner football, and I go out there at 250 pounds and start running 70, 80-pound little boys and girls over, the fathers would get up and say, call a paddy wagon, he's insane!
[00:53:32.114 --> 00:53:38.196]  But it's all about making you accept something that is completely evil and completely out of control.
[00:53:42.932 --> 00:53:43.853]  These guys are bullies.
[00:53:48.238 --> 00:53:51.401]  Woman given prison sentence for beating up migrant stalker.
[00:53:51.441 --> 00:53:53.903]  That's an EuropeWars.com article.
[00:53:55.325 --> 00:53:59.289]  Ex-official raises alarm over 160 terrorists freed early from UK prisons.
[00:53:59.609 --> 00:54:01.551]  Whole bunch of them have already committed terror attacks.
[00:54:01.912 --> 00:54:05.636]  But people that commit thought crimes get more time than people that have actually stabbed or killed people.
[00:54:09.485 --> 00:54:14.091]  It's the death of logic and it's done scientifically as the system assaults logic.
[00:54:14.932 --> 00:54:23.142]  So that you will put up with anything, including the sexualization of your children, where now they say, oh, you're a 50 year old man, but you identify as a seven year old girl.
[00:54:24.420 --> 00:54:26.501]  So now you're going to be given access to seven-year-old girls.
[00:54:26.581 --> 00:54:28.022]  That's happening in the UK.
[00:54:28.302 --> 00:54:33.485]  It's all Tabastock Institute, it's psychological warfare, and it must be opposed.
[00:54:33.565 --> 00:54:40.248]  Is there no level of depravity, no level of bullying, no level of idiocy that we will not submit to?
[00:54:40.268 --> 00:54:45.511]  And that's where big tech censorship comes in, is that
[00:54:46.971 --> 00:54:49.933]  They're now censoring Rand Paul speeches off YouTube and Facebook.
[00:54:50.374 --> 00:54:58.500]  And now anybody that says, no, there are only two genders, you're being censored in a reign of unscientific terror, of un-American, of un-Western evil.
[00:55:00.475 --> 00:55:02.136]  The likes of which the planet has never seen.
[00:55:03.016 --> 00:55:06.638]  All in the name of tolerance, we're losing all of our real tolerance.
[00:55:06.658 --> 00:55:15.982]  We're going to go to break and come back with Dr. Steve Pachetnik on what's really happening in the next big move against President Trump with Dr. Steve Pachetnik.
[00:55:16.622 --> 00:55:20.804]  We have another interesting guest joining us as well and I also intend, oh, Tyler Nixon.
[00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:25.784]  It is coming on with Roger Stone news and information.
[00:55:25.824 --> 00:55:27.566]  I'll be hosting the fourth hour.
[00:55:27.626 --> 00:55:29.868]  So look for that global exclusive as well.
[00:55:30.109 --> 00:55:39.038]  Just briefly, our storable food company has high quality food on hand, but it takes 10 to 14 days to have it delivered because they've got to package it.
[00:55:39.479 --> 00:55:41.120]  Almost everybody else has been sold out a while.
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:42.021]  And I want to tell you,
[00:55:43.203 --> 00:55:45.505]  Food orders are going up, not down.
[00:55:46.066 --> 00:55:48.949]  And so, get your order in before it gets extended out.
[00:55:49.109 --> 00:55:52.152]  Lock in, right now, the high-quality, affordable food.
[00:55:52.192 --> 00:55:55.195]  In fact, I'd forgotten to play this little funny taste test.
[00:55:55.255 --> 00:55:57.057]  It's a real taste test the guys put together.
[00:55:57.517 --> 00:56:04.965]  But let's roll out the break with the taste test, because all the food really is high-quality, and it's the lowest price you're going to find for it anywhere.
[00:56:05.045 --> 00:56:05.846]  InfoWareStore.com.
[00:56:06.306 --> 00:56:12.813]  We brought in a non-globalist paid actor and did a blind taste test between the mac and cheese from Storable Foods at Infowarsstore.com and one of America's leading brands.
[00:56:13.074 --> 00:56:13.854]  These are the results.
[00:56:14.275 --> 00:56:17.378]  Now go ahead and try the first macaroni and cheese to your right.
[00:56:19.401 --> 00:56:20.702]  It literally smells like nothing.
[00:56:26.689 --> 00:56:27.590]  What were your first thoughts?
[00:56:30.629 --> 00:56:31.009]  Typical.
[00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:40.881]  Takes me back to when the babysitter doesn't quite know how to make it like your mom makes it, so it's just not... Let's move on to the one on your left.
[00:56:42.723 --> 00:56:44.244]  See, this one actually smells like cheese.
[00:56:44.264 --> 00:56:46.407]  Alright, don't have any on my fork here.
[00:57:01.914 --> 00:57:05.815]  Go buy your storable food at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:57:06.275 --> 00:57:29.240]  Every time we have had Dr. Steve Pucinich on in the last year or so, he has warned that Barr, the Attorney General, has beyond deep state ties and has tied him with Epstein and the ongoing cover-up and that he would end up biting the President in the ass.
[00:57:30.191 --> 00:57:38.194]  Now a lot of people are saying, oh, this is because there's heat in the media on Barr, so he came out and criticized Trump, and Trump doesn't care because it's okay.
[00:57:39.034 --> 00:57:41.595]  The President has the power to say these judges are out of control.
[00:57:42.035 --> 00:57:47.917]  He's had all these other judges saying he can't control the border or can't block people from Islamic countries that don't even have proper vetting.
[00:57:49.157 --> 00:57:56.580]  So it's all about the deep state or the bureaucracy hamstringing the President so that he's paralyzed, in my view.
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:59.541]  But you can say what you want about Bill Barr.
[00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:02.370]  I want to believe the guy's a good guy.
[00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:04.891]  I'm not involved in power struggles in the federal government.
[00:58:05.891 --> 00:58:13.013]  My issue is, is that he said Epstein killed himself, and clearly, whatever you believe, that's not true.
[00:58:13.734 --> 00:58:21.316]  And there's been no more indictments, and we know it's a huge Clinton-Massad corrupt elements, the CIA blackmail ring.
[00:58:21.336 --> 00:58:22.176]  That's all confirmed now.
[00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:25.333]  And so, why is nothing being done?
[00:58:25.433 --> 00:58:29.138]  And so, anytime Dr. Pucinich wants to come on, we're usually trying to get him on, he can't come on.
[00:58:29.438 --> 00:58:30.079]  Told him, call me.
[00:58:30.119 --> 00:58:30.860]  He called this morning.
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:33.002]  He said, listen, we've got a warning to the President.
[00:58:33.022 --> 00:58:33.883]  This is really serious.
[00:58:33.963 --> 00:58:37.648]  And this isn't, this isn't like bragging like we're Deep State.
[00:58:38.389 --> 00:58:39.390]  The real Deep State is...
[00:58:40.512 --> 00:58:47.534]  People that work all over this country, whether you're in California, or New York, or Florida, or Texas, or Ohio, or Indiana, or Nebraska, or Mississippi.
[00:58:48.014 --> 00:58:51.595]  The deep state is people that put their boots on every day and take care of their kids and go to work.
[00:58:51.635 --> 00:58:56.557]  And the military, and doctors, and school teachers, and the auto mechanics, and the truck drivers.
[00:58:57.759 --> 00:59:03.883]  But it's true when he says the bureaucracy and the Harvard elites and these lawyers aren't, they think they're the deep state.
[00:59:04.443 --> 00:59:06.885]  But it's we the people that are really the deep state.
[00:59:07.425 --> 00:59:10.067]  And it's time for the tail to stop wagging the dog.
[00:59:10.087 --> 00:59:12.769]  And when we say no, they have no power.
[00:59:12.849 --> 00:59:14.290]  And they're running into that now.
[00:59:14.330 --> 00:59:17.592]  But we were all asking just seven days ago when he was exonerated yet again,
[00:59:18.212 --> 00:59:19.173]  What are they going to do?
[00:59:38.562 --> 00:59:41.204]  And now we see Barr raise his ugly head.
[00:59:41.224 --> 00:59:43.786]  So with the balance of the hour, Dr. Steve Pchenik joins us.
[00:59:43.826 --> 00:59:48.889]  And I know you'll get into the whole history of it in the background, but there's a good chance Trump will end up seeing at least five minutes of this.
[00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:51.671]  He calls it the clips, and people bring it to him.
[00:59:51.691 --> 00:59:52.392]  I'll just leave it at that.
[00:59:52.792 --> 00:59:55.594]  What is your just quick synopsis in five minutes, Dr. Pchenik?
[00:59:56.014 --> 01:00:00.137]  I know the president knows who you are and your background, the things you've done in different agencies and things.
[01:00:00.437 --> 01:00:04.100]  And as a private citizen, what is your five-minute synopsis for the president?
[01:00:05.313 --> 01:00:07.796]  Five-minute synopsis of the President's very simple.
[01:00:07.936 --> 01:00:10.058]  Number one, William Barr has to go.
[01:00:10.298 --> 01:00:11.539]  I've said it a year ago.
[01:00:11.559 --> 01:00:25.112]  The reason for it, not only has he really insulted the President and said an inappropriate thing, that the President can't in fact tweet and interfere with the Department of Justice.
[01:00:25.172 --> 01:00:26.674]  He can do whatever he wants.
[01:00:26.834 --> 01:00:27.575]  That's the point.
[01:00:28.115 --> 01:00:39.438]  What Barr has not said is that he has not told anybody that from 71 to 77 he was a CIA operative and analyst.
[01:00:40.038 --> 01:00:45.520]  In 1989 it was Barr who decided that we should invade Panama and gave the go-ahead.
[01:00:45.620 --> 01:00:53.682]  Now the reason I was against that, I went out to see Noriega and I told him I will be here to represent you and personally
[01:00:54.362 --> 01:01:00.587]  Take you out if you need to be but you're gonna have a war that you don't need and Noriega pinpointed Barr.
[01:01:00.707 --> 01:01:09.734]  He pinpointed Bush senior He said that these are all the people who are involved in corruption including the CIA So what we have here is an individual
[01:01:10.254 --> 01:01:14.258]  Who not only is deceptive, but they call him a street fighter.
[01:01:14.638 --> 01:01:15.599]  I'm a street fighter.
[01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:17.340]  This guy's not a street fighter.
[01:01:17.701 --> 01:01:23.686]  This guy comes from a very nice neighborhood, from a father who converted from Judaism to Catholicism.
[01:01:24.026 --> 01:01:25.047]  That's all fine.
[01:01:25.127 --> 01:01:27.129]  He went to Columbia or whatever.
[01:01:27.509 --> 01:01:31.132]  But the truth of the matter is he's very close to Mueller.
[01:01:31.212 --> 01:01:34.455]  He is a CIA operative, no matter what he says.
[01:01:34.875 --> 01:01:40.337]  Which means that his agenda is not in concert with the President Trump's agenda.
[01:01:40.397 --> 01:01:42.057]  And I said that a long time ago.
[01:01:42.457 --> 01:01:58.682]  The flag for what I had to say and why I called you up was the fact that I thought it was beyond absurd to talk about Roger Stone serving any time, let alone seven to nine years in a federal penitentiary,
[01:01:59.342 --> 01:02:05.946]  And a judge was going to place that type of sentence on Roger Stone.
[01:02:06.026 --> 01:02:07.427]  He didn't kill anybody.
[01:02:07.888 --> 01:02:09.769]  He didn't intimidate anybody.
[01:02:09.849 --> 01:02:12.751]  I mean, basically, Roger Stone is Roger Stone.
[01:02:12.851 --> 01:02:13.531]  You know him.
[01:02:13.811 --> 01:02:16.673]  I've known about him since the Nixon administration.
[01:02:17.053 --> 01:02:18.354]  He doesn't hurt people.
[01:02:18.414 --> 01:02:19.375]  He doesn't kill them.
[01:02:19.415 --> 01:02:20.335]  He doesn't touch them.
[01:02:20.796 --> 01:02:25.699]  But you do not put a sentence like that, even in theory.
[01:02:26.391 --> 01:02:40.219]  And the reason why I called you up to say is that was, again, the manifestation of a corrupt Justice Department, a corrupt FBI system, which Mueller knew about, Comey knew about, and Barr knows about.
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:42.841]  Because Barr is a close friend of Mueller.
[01:02:43.121 --> 01:02:45.623]  He's been involved in all of these elements.
[01:02:45.683 --> 01:02:47.704]  So, Trump, once again,
[01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:49.678]  He's isolated.
[01:02:49.938 --> 01:02:53.299]  He has to begin to fire more and more people.
[01:02:53.439 --> 01:02:56.260]  Barr must go within the next few weeks.
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:57.920]  There's no reason for him there.
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:03:00.161]  He's not doing his full job.
[01:03:00.441 --> 01:03:01.321]  Well, let me ask you this.
[01:03:01.441 --> 01:03:03.302]  Why do you think he's making this move now?
[01:03:03.362 --> 01:03:08.383]  Because Trump's finally firing hundreds of deep staters and so they're hitting the panic button?
[01:03:09.935 --> 01:03:11.817]  Barr is a political animal.
[01:03:11.998 --> 01:03:16.443]  Contrary to what he says publicly, he says, oh, I'm not intimidated by the press.
[01:03:16.603 --> 01:03:18.425]  I'm not intimidated by a president.
[01:03:18.786 --> 01:03:20.187]  I'm above intimidation.
[01:03:20.648 --> 01:03:21.189]  Wrong.
[01:03:21.609 --> 01:03:25.654]  The minute you hear that kind of negativity and self-aggrandizement,
[01:03:25.954 --> 01:03:26.855]  It's the reverse.
[01:03:27.115 --> 01:03:29.116]  He's a total political animal.
[01:03:29.457 --> 01:03:31.598]  He's nothing but a political animal.
[01:03:31.718 --> 01:03:34.600]  And he likes to demonstrate that he's tough and independent.
[01:03:34.881 --> 01:03:36.902]  He's neither tough nor independent.
[01:03:37.262 --> 01:03:38.563]  He worked for Verizon.
[01:03:38.603 --> 01:03:39.504]  He worked for GTV.
[01:03:39.544 --> 01:03:40.105]  No, I agree.
[01:03:40.145 --> 01:03:43.187]  So why did he pop up and stab the president in the back at this point?
[01:03:43.840 --> 01:03:46.962]  Because he didn't want to be challenged.
[01:03:47.222 --> 01:03:50.504]  And a man like Trump is a true street fighter.
[01:03:50.944 --> 01:03:54.286]  You don't mess with Trump unless you come from New York.
[01:03:54.666 --> 01:03:56.387]  You understand what he's about.
[01:03:56.828 --> 01:04:04.372]  And a guy like Barr, who grew up in New York, and actually his father was head of the Dalton School, is highly compromised.
[01:04:04.692 --> 01:04:05.372]  Trump is not.
[01:04:05.833 --> 01:04:07.073]  He made his own business.
[01:04:07.414 --> 01:04:08.834]  You want to say Trump lies?
[01:04:09.015 --> 01:04:09.575]  That's fine.
[01:04:10.135 --> 01:04:18.000]  These people came up in their own, in their little political lawyer system, Trump's his own animal, and that's why they've got such a problem, is he's not being ruled by their committees.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:19.201]  Correct.
[01:04:19.421 --> 01:04:34.650]  And what Trump is now understanding, he's brought back correctly, Hope Hicks and some others, his body defender, and he now understands that he has to rely on a very close circle of advisors, and he still has to clean out the way.
[01:04:34.670 --> 01:04:37.812]  That's what you kept saying, he shouldn't have more than 100 people at the National Security Council, not 3,000.
[01:04:39.315 --> 01:04:39.935]  That's correct.
[01:04:40.175 --> 01:04:41.876]  And O'Brien, I give him credit.
[01:04:41.916 --> 01:04:45.938]  He just fired 70, as we talked about on this show months ago.
[01:04:45.998 --> 01:04:53.242]  But I think it has to go down to 50 and even lower than that, because Trump cannot work with a critical mass of people.
[01:04:53.877 --> 01:04:56.159]  Who are deployed from other agencies.
[01:05:11.369 --> 01:05:15.533]  Lawyer deep staters once and for all and really get around to the business of relaunching America.
[01:05:16.154 --> 01:05:18.316]  Straight ahead with Dr. Steve Pachinik on the other side.
[01:05:18.976 --> 01:05:24.081]  But I agree with him and we're going to get into Barr and Epstein because that's the big litmus test for me.
[01:05:24.401 --> 01:05:25.442]  Where are the indictments?
[01:05:26.243 --> 01:05:27.765]  What's happening with the blackmail rings?
[01:05:27.965 --> 01:05:29.066]  I want to see that dealt with.
[01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:32.929]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:05:33.490 --> 01:05:38.455]  Listen, I want listeners to understand something, and I know you get this, but we don't make stuff up here.
[01:05:39.035 --> 01:05:41.017]  We really try to study what's happening in the world.
[01:05:41.618 --> 01:05:45.481]  Not the official propaganda, but how the world really works.
[01:05:46.062 --> 01:05:49.045]  And that's why the establishment, the corrupt elements of it, want us off the air.
[01:05:49.525 --> 01:05:55.150]  Because we're unfiltered, we have a lot of really smart guests on, a lot of great callers, and we're just here trying to figure things out.
[01:05:56.258 --> 01:06:11.299]  And I've got a quote here from Karl Rove on, we're history's actors now, and it's a very arrogant statement he made, but actually if you have the right side of history and you have the historical position and the ability to take that
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:15.862]  At the flood, that fortune, you can be history's actor.
[01:06:15.882 --> 01:06:29.188]  So I want to talk about that with Dr. Steve Pchenik, because this morning when I was talking to him, he mentioned something along those lines, and I want to explain the flip side of that statement by Karl Rove, who was not one of history's actors, and he knows that now, but separately.
[01:06:30.336 --> 01:06:40.680]  This is Texas A&M 2007, and it's Homeland Security, it's the Department of the Army, Headquarters, United States Special Operations Command, and it's all the letters right here to show TV viewers.
[01:06:41.520 --> 01:06:43.561]  And this is the nano-silver that we have.
[01:06:44.602 --> 01:06:49.764]  Put out by one of the top companies in the world, American Biotech Labs, LLC.
[01:06:50.484 --> 01:07:00.047]  And this is the silver that the Pentagon found with the wound gel and all of the private label that was the best for taking out all sorts of bacteria and viruses, including the SARS family, that is the coronavirus.
[01:07:00.647 --> 01:07:02.768]  And I'm not saying it's a panacea or a silver bullet.
[01:07:03.428 --> 01:07:04.148]  Oh, it is silver.
[01:07:04.708 --> 01:07:06.189]  It's one of the best silver systems you'll find.
[01:07:06.469 --> 01:07:07.650]  We sold out of the 16-ounce.
[01:07:07.690 --> 01:07:09.110]  We have the 1-ounce and 3-ounce left.
[01:07:09.570 --> 01:07:10.651]  That is selling out quickly.
[01:07:10.671 --> 01:07:11.811]  It also funds the InfoWar.
[01:07:11.851 --> 01:07:12.551]  So get yours today.
[01:07:12.571 --> 01:07:13.251]  It's for topical.
[01:07:13.552 --> 01:07:14.592]  You can also ingest it.
[01:07:16.072 --> 01:07:17.313]  InfoWarStore.com.
[01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:24.615]  Consult your physician, obviously, because even though it's approved for that, you still need to find out what's happening personally in your own life.
[01:07:25.236 --> 01:07:27.156]  But it's something that I use for my family.
[01:07:27.196 --> 01:07:30.717]  It's something that has really made my life a lot better.
[01:07:32.618 --> 01:07:35.240]  30 years ago, they would attack different silver solutions.
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:39.483]  Now, it's in the hospitals, it's in the drugstores, it's everywhere.
[01:07:39.763 --> 01:07:40.864]  And this is the best one out there.
[01:07:40.904 --> 01:07:42.185]  We have the super silver wound gel.
[01:07:42.806 --> 01:07:47.029]  We also have the super silver whitening toothpaste that has the 15 parts per million nano silver.
[01:07:47.309 --> 01:07:49.470]  But it's way stronger than regular coil silver.
[01:07:50.231 --> 01:07:53.113]  So, again, this is not to be swallowed.
[01:07:54.274 --> 01:07:55.115]  So use it wisely.
[01:07:55.175 --> 01:07:55.775]  It's powerful.
[01:07:57.537 --> 01:07:58.959]  It is powerful for a reason.
[01:07:58.979 --> 01:08:00.281]  It kills bacteria and viruses.
[01:08:00.321 --> 01:08:02.464]  It means too much of it isn't good for you either.
[01:08:02.885 --> 01:08:05.388]  So InfoWorksStore.com, that's how we fund this operation.
[01:08:05.409 --> 01:08:06.630]  So going back to Dr. Steve Pchenik.
[01:08:07.912 --> 01:08:09.415]  Last Friday, I'm on air and I say...
[01:08:11.064 --> 01:08:12.365]  What is the new hoax gonna be?
[01:08:12.925 --> 01:08:16.327]  And I said, it's clearly him just being the president.
[01:08:17.628 --> 01:08:21.590]  Doing anything, they say, is corruption because they want the presidency paralyzed.
[01:08:21.610 --> 01:08:27.133]  And the answer is firing a bunch of people, being the president, and not appeasing them anymore.
[01:08:27.153 --> 01:08:29.094]  And I think the president knows that now.
[01:08:29.114 --> 01:08:31.476]  I think that's why Barr has come out from under his rock.
[01:08:32.176 --> 01:08:33.517]  And it's showing us who he really is.
[01:08:33.537 --> 01:08:40.682]  You know, we're hearing from the usual suspects, queuing people, that, oh, this is a masterful stroke with the president and this is to get folks off of bars back.
[01:08:41.003 --> 01:08:41.743]  Off his back?
[01:08:42.284 --> 01:08:44.025]  This judge should be indicted!
[01:08:45.086 --> 01:08:48.528]  The jury foreman is a Democratic operative.
[01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:49.809]  They wanted me arrested.
[01:08:49.829 --> 01:08:50.670]  Here's the Washington Post.
[01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:52.591]  Alex Jones threatened to name Roger Stone juror.
[01:08:52.912 --> 01:08:54.493]  Experts say he might be jury tampering.
[01:08:54.733 --> 01:09:07.271]  They have former federal prosecutors under Obama saying arrest me when I pointed out that this woman headed up a federal agency as a juror and that her husband was high-level lawyer number three on the Mueller probe.
[01:09:08.177 --> 01:09:09.578]  So, I didn't threaten to name them.
[01:09:10.058 --> 01:09:11.879]  I did name them, like Eric Surumowa.
[01:09:12.219 --> 01:09:18.281]  And of course, the lawyers all said, and the Constitution says, I have a right to expose jurors if they have a conflict of interest.
[01:09:18.662 --> 01:09:20.562]  That wasn't jury tampering, it's doing my job.
[01:09:20.622 --> 01:09:24.244]  So, the intimidation of these people, paralyzing everyone.
[01:09:24.804 --> 01:09:25.945]  You're a medical doctor yourself.
[01:09:26.045 --> 01:09:28.046]  How do we get the President through this?
[01:09:28.466 --> 01:09:29.827]  What would you advise him to do?
[01:09:30.107 --> 01:09:31.507]  You know, you're saying, get rid of Barr.
[01:09:31.987 --> 01:09:34.869]  Then they'll spin that, that, oh, see, Barr stood up to him, so get rid of him.
[01:09:35.249 --> 01:09:37.330]  All I know is he's surrounded by these lawyers.
[01:09:37.810 --> 01:09:40.232]  No, I'm laughing because you hit it right on the head.
[01:10:03.935 --> 01:10:15.368]  Most of the people that Trump unfortunately picked in the beginning, Zalmay Khalilzad, John Bolton, a clear violation of what happened in the past.
[01:10:15.408 --> 01:10:17.991]  There are many others, including myself, who can tell you.
[01:10:18.011 --> 01:10:19.733]  The guy's totally incompetent.
[01:10:20.214 --> 01:10:21.735]  He's self-aggrandizing.
[01:10:21.755 --> 01:10:22.676]  They're manipulative.
[01:10:23.709 --> 01:10:32.191]  The reason I can understand what Trump did is he has to rely on an instinct and a limited amount of information.
[01:10:32.251 --> 01:10:34.072]  Remember, he comes from the business world.
[01:10:34.612 --> 01:10:39.133]  When I talk to my people in the intelligence world, I have to say just one word.
[01:10:39.694 --> 01:10:41.214]  He's not a politician.
[01:10:41.434 --> 01:10:43.315]  He's not an intel officer.
[01:10:43.435 --> 01:10:44.795]  He is a businessman.
[01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:48.376]  As a businessman, the dynamics are very different.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:54.646]  So where normally he would come in and he would have, let's say, a foreman of the construction group.
[01:10:54.686 --> 01:10:56.989]  And I've been in construction and reconstruction.
[01:10:57.549 --> 01:11:01.354]  That foreman would have told Trump, no, you need a better painter.
[01:11:01.414 --> 01:11:02.675]  You need a better carpenter.
[01:11:02.715 --> 01:11:03.656]  You need a better this.
[01:11:03.736 --> 01:11:05.138]  No, that guy didn't work well.
[01:11:06.098 --> 01:11:07.838]  Because they're outcome-based.
[01:11:07.858 --> 01:11:11.459]  They're about a mission instead of bureaucracy and lawyers and kissing ass.
[01:11:12.199 --> 01:11:12.699]  Correct.
[01:11:13.019 --> 01:11:17.420]  And Jared Kushner and Ivanka and all of those, they're new.
[01:11:17.740 --> 01:11:27.442]  No matter how well they serve the president, they do not understand how deep the intelligence community and the real deep state goes.
[01:11:28.042 --> 01:11:31.083]  When you're talking about a guy like Barr,
[01:11:32.094 --> 01:11:38.376]  I don't think they understood that Barr basically exonerated all of the Iran Contra people.
[01:11:38.416 --> 01:11:39.176]  Well, who were they?
[01:11:39.796 --> 01:11:41.417]  One was Dewey Claridge.
[01:11:41.737 --> 01:11:42.417]  I knew Dewey.
[01:11:42.477 --> 01:11:44.257]  I mean, he's a good DDO.
[01:11:44.318 --> 01:11:46.618]  He was a good CIA operative.
[01:11:46.658 --> 01:11:47.859]  You had Claire George.
[01:11:48.079 --> 01:11:49.299]  I like Claire George.
[01:11:49.739 --> 01:11:52.800]  Then you have McFarland, who was a disaster.
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:59.807]  There's no one there who really understands how that type of history comes through again and again.
[01:11:59.827 --> 01:12:00.147]  That's right.
[01:12:00.227 --> 01:12:02.750]  Trump doesn't know how to interface with the real government.
[01:12:02.890 --> 01:12:04.071]  Instead, he's dealing with the lawyers.
[01:12:04.912 --> 01:12:05.372]  Correct.
[01:12:05.512 --> 01:12:06.974]  That's a brilliant way to put it.
[01:12:07.094 --> 01:12:08.776]  He needs someone in there.
[01:12:08.976 --> 01:12:11.218]  Not necessarily me, you, or someone else.
[01:12:11.578 --> 01:12:13.640]  Mike Flynn, for example.
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:16.143]  That's why they were so scared of Flynn, because he knew how it worked.
[01:12:17.116 --> 01:12:19.639]  Well, Flynn was the director of D.I.A.
[01:12:19.719 --> 01:12:20.640]  D.I.A.
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:23.523]  was an organization that always protected me.
[01:12:23.763 --> 01:12:26.045]  Even in Panama, where the C.I.A.
[01:12:26.125 --> 01:12:29.689]  dumped me and marked me for assassination, the D.I.A.
[01:12:29.729 --> 01:12:34.674]  came in and protected me and took me out of Panama and took me off the roster.
[01:12:35.034 --> 01:12:40.220]  I go into the Soviet Union, D.I.A., I've got to explain it, Defense Intelligence Agency.
[01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:48.688]  There is an inherent conflict, and I've said it for years on your show, between the military intelligence and the CIA.
[01:12:49.088 --> 01:12:52.972]  The CIA has had nothing but problems throughout their careers.
[01:12:52.992 --> 01:12:58.638]  Well, that's because the Army knew since 1947 that the CIA was kind of set up by globalist and British intel, so they've never trusted it.
[01:12:59.454 --> 01:12:59.834]  Correct.
[01:12:59.874 --> 01:13:04.216]  So when you say deep, deep state, you're talking about the military is the original deep state.
[01:13:05.556 --> 01:13:06.197]  Exactly.
[01:13:06.277 --> 01:13:27.005]  That if I was thrown off the base on Fort Amador by Colin Powell, who was a pathological liar, lied about Vietnam, lied about anthrax in 9-11, then you have guys like Mark Cisneros and Defense Intelligence Agency, Boise, bring me back in and we break into the
[01:13:28.806 --> 01:13:33.429]  Military assets so that we can use them for propaganda.
[01:13:33.829 --> 01:13:37.731]  I write that in my book, but my point is Trump doesn't know that.
[01:13:37.851 --> 01:13:39.212]  He doesn't need to know that.
[01:13:39.332 --> 01:13:44.395]  It's like saying to him, look, you remember the construction you did on 42nd Street 25 years ago?
[01:13:44.755 --> 01:13:47.217]  He may or may not have remembered, but he certainly knew.
[01:13:47.817 --> 01:13:50.279]  Who to get, what to get, and what had to be done.
[01:13:50.799 --> 01:13:52.941]  That he does not have in the White House.
[01:13:53.001 --> 01:13:55.863]  So O'Brien is part of the Bush administration.
[01:13:55.943 --> 01:13:56.463]  Is he good?
[01:13:56.544 --> 01:13:56.864]  Bad?
[01:13:57.124 --> 01:13:58.005]  I really don't know.
[01:13:58.465 --> 01:14:03.969]  But the sifting mechanism, the way they choose people, is faulty.
[01:14:04.309 --> 01:14:11.234]  And from that, he has paid a very... And so he keeps being goal-oriented, they lie to his face, and then turn around and don't do it.
[01:14:11.274 --> 01:14:12.055]  How does he get around that?
[01:14:12.967 --> 01:14:13.568]  That's correct.
[01:14:13.768 --> 01:14:20.054]  So you had Comey, you had Mueller, now you have Barr, and now you're going to have another person who came in.
[01:14:20.374 --> 01:14:24.158]  The four people who were the prosecutors were all Obama people.
[01:14:24.458 --> 01:14:28.181]  You have a judge who was an Obama people in the Washington, D.C.
[01:14:28.602 --> 01:14:30.744]  If she convicts Stone,
[01:14:33.570 --> 01:14:39.634]  That's going to be a problem because Stone must be completely exonerated of any behavior.
[01:14:39.654 --> 01:14:41.256]  Because that destroys the whole Russiagate.
[01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:42.076]  It's bigger than Stone.
[01:14:42.116 --> 01:14:43.397]  I totally agree with you and Tucker Carlson.
[01:14:43.437 --> 01:14:51.323]  Let's come back then and say what you would do right now if you were the president and what they're going to do if he doesn't take action against him because clearly they're pissed now.
[01:14:51.683 --> 01:14:54.825]  They thought this impeachment will work and they thought other things were about to happen.
[01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:55.366]  It didn't happen.
[01:14:57.048 --> 01:14:58.389]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:14:59.329 --> 01:15:01.210]  You know, there's 17 different U.S.
[01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:07.854]  intelligence agencies, and Dr. Pachinik should probably speak to that briefly, but he's talking about defense intelligence.
[01:15:07.874 --> 01:15:11.776]  We have Ivan Reikland, Green Beret, Patriot, smart guy I've met a few times.
[01:15:11.816 --> 01:15:12.896]  He's coming on next hour.
[01:15:12.916 --> 01:15:20.921]  If Pachinik wants to stay one more segment, they can overlap together to talk about the waterfront and what's happening and what the military's view on all of this is.
[01:15:22.352 --> 01:15:28.485]  To show you how, even if you have the best of intentions, you've got to have life experience to understand things.
[01:15:28.545 --> 01:15:30.029]  So I remember I was on air 26 years ago, 1995.
[01:15:33.570 --> 01:15:40.054]  And Bill Clinton had the military, Delta Force, training to take over cities to overthrow governors that opposed him.
[01:15:40.374 --> 01:15:45.597]  Clinton was delusional, thought he could have a martial law takeover ahead of Oklahoma City before he staged that.
[01:15:46.897 --> 01:15:47.718]  And it all petered out.
[01:15:47.798 --> 01:15:56.403]  But then I was getting intel and documents from people, like we'd be at a checkpoint on the side of the highway and an FBI agent would pull up and give us a document.
[01:15:57.341 --> 01:16:04.485]  Or then later, we'd have people from the Army give us info, and then I'd go on air and talk about it all, and go, the Delta Force is attacking us!
[01:16:04.865 --> 01:16:08.867]  And later they go, no, no, we gave you the information, we're not the ones doing it, we're being ordered to do it.
[01:16:09.467 --> 01:16:12.789]  So, but I was like 26 years old then, folks, 25 years old then.
[01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:17.591]  I was just thinking, you mean the police are coming to get us?
[01:16:17.631 --> 01:16:18.471]  They're coming to take our guns?
[01:16:18.531 --> 01:16:20.052]  No, no, the police don't want your guns.
[01:16:20.352 --> 01:16:21.692]  They're being ordered to prepare it.
[01:16:21.752 --> 01:16:22.513]  So is the military.
[01:16:22.913 --> 01:16:24.874]  So it's a level of sophistication.
[01:16:25.134 --> 01:16:28.215]  And I was smart at certain things back then, but still didn't have experience.
[01:16:28.595 --> 01:16:29.895]  I just had a popular talk show.
[01:16:30.496 --> 01:16:32.476]  So people ask, how'd you know all this stuff, Alex?
[01:16:32.636 --> 01:16:33.777]  I didn't know a lot of it.
[01:16:34.177 --> 01:16:36.038]  I had smart people giving me stuff.
[01:16:36.998 --> 01:16:44.181]  And then I couldn't read between the lines because I was so young and so ignorant that it was only later I was like,
[01:16:44.941 --> 01:16:45.361]  We're good to go.
[01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:19.736]  To sit there and watch out, as you said, it's been good FBI agents and good people in defense intelligence and just good people across America in private life that are the real deep state that have been blocking this globalist takeover.
[01:17:19.777 --> 01:17:21.818]  Is that what you were getting at, Dr. Pachinic?
[01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:23.218]  Pretty much.
[01:17:24.779 --> 01:17:29.602]  I mean, there are names in general, but I will give you, for example, you mentioned a hero.
[01:17:30.522 --> 01:17:34.084]  There's no reason why you should have known he was not a hero, Daniel Ellsberg.
[01:17:34.975 --> 01:17:39.798]  You see, that gentleman, Daniel Ellsberg, came out with the Pentagon Papers.
[01:17:39.878 --> 01:17:43.480]  What most people don't realize, he was totally CIA.
[01:17:44.080 --> 01:17:44.860]  How do I know?
[01:17:45.041 --> 01:17:49.403]  When I went to MIT and DARPA and the CIA trained me, there he was.
[01:17:49.983 --> 01:17:58.668]  So, once again, even the release of so-called secret information is created by the deep state.
[01:17:59.432 --> 01:18:01.893]  And I don't expect you to know that.
[01:18:02.153 --> 01:18:04.293]  I don't expect anyone else to know that.
[01:18:04.633 --> 01:18:06.053]  That was happenstance.
[01:18:06.493 --> 01:18:10.674]  And I understood very quickly what Daniel Ellsberg was or is.
[01:18:10.794 --> 01:18:12.715]  And I don't bemoan it.
[01:18:12.835 --> 01:18:13.855]  I don't decry it.
[01:18:13.975 --> 01:18:15.475]  It was just part of the game.
[01:18:15.555 --> 01:18:17.196]  Is he the same thing as, like, Snowden?
[01:18:18.416 --> 01:18:18.836]  Correct.
[01:18:20.296 --> 01:18:23.617]  But that was another faction giving me information, though, right?
[01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:31.164]  Well, but you have to understand, the intelligence community never plays one side or the other.
[01:18:31.324 --> 01:18:32.604]  It plays both sides.
[01:18:32.985 --> 01:18:35.766]  It's truly what we call Hegelian dialectic.
[01:18:35.846 --> 01:18:43.730]  I don't want to sound too esoteric, but it plays the right, the left, the left, the right, always at the same time.
[01:18:44.291 --> 01:18:49.493]  So somebody like you, even alternative media, has to cut in through the reality.
[01:18:49.894 --> 01:18:52.215]  And this is what Trump has to understand.
[01:18:53.348 --> 01:18:59.434]  When he builds a building or when I build a company or create a company, it's binary.
[01:18:59.554 --> 01:19:01.176]  You either do it or you don't.
[01:19:01.276 --> 01:19:01.856]  You fail.
[01:19:02.577 --> 01:19:07.562]  In the world of manipulation, which he understands very well, it's never binary.
[01:19:08.042 --> 01:19:11.706]  It's always, well, it's this and that at the same time.
[01:19:12.313 --> 01:19:19.741]  What you need is some form of discipline and hierarchy where you can control that type of amorphous behavior.
[01:19:19.761 --> 01:19:19.901]  Exactly.
[01:19:19.941 --> 01:19:24.867]  By him letting them run wild, it creates a vacuum that just begs them to keep trying coups.
[01:19:25.854 --> 01:19:26.415]  Correct.
[01:19:26.615 --> 01:19:37.984]  And what he does, and what he's really brilliant at, and they finally figured it out, is that he creates chaos, but he lives in that chaos, and he knows how to work it.
[01:19:38.404 --> 01:19:42.728]  That's why Nancy Pelosi, in two minutes of her 35-year life,
[01:19:44.716 --> 01:19:49.858]  Has destroyed an entire career by simply tearing up that piece of paper.
[01:19:49.938 --> 01:19:50.178]  Idiot.
[01:19:50.218 --> 01:19:51.158]  That's all that's needed.
[01:19:51.458 --> 01:19:52.279]  Look at it again.
[01:19:52.759 --> 01:19:54.779]  You'd never have to know anything more.
[01:19:55.259 --> 01:19:57.340]  The same thing with all the Democrats.
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:58.741]  The party is dead.
[01:19:59.361 --> 01:20:02.782]  But now you have a young man like Peter Buttigieg, right?
[01:20:03.362 --> 01:20:08.664]  What's the ostensible concept that he has, you know, given out?
[01:20:08.724 --> 01:20:10.925]  What's the key element of Peter Buttigieg?
[01:20:11.145 --> 01:20:11.765]  He's young.
[01:20:12.682 --> 01:20:15.703]  But more importantly, he said he's homosexual.
[01:20:16.243 --> 01:20:17.544]  Now, why would he say that?
[01:20:17.944 --> 01:20:20.325]  Number one, it may or may not be true.
[01:20:20.365 --> 01:20:21.345]  I couldn't care less.
[01:20:21.625 --> 01:20:25.867]  We've had other homosexual presidents, like Obama, which he concealed it.
[01:20:26.307 --> 01:20:34.590]  But the one thing that Peter did not say, and the one thing that's been hidden is, oh my God, guess what he belongs to?
[01:20:35.279 --> 01:20:42.686]  The McKenzie Consulting Firm, and you have to be pretty sophisticated to know this, is a secret consulting firm.
[01:20:43.107 --> 01:20:56.981]  They usually recruit people who come out of Harvard, have a Rhodes Scholar, I was on that committee, and usually those Rhodes Scholars are co-opted by our intelligence community, as Clinton was, Bill Clinton.
[01:20:57.461 --> 01:21:05.207]  He worked for the CIA, he had a report to it, as Hillary was, and guess who served with the CIA in Afghanistan?
[01:21:05.607 --> 01:21:06.628]  Peter Budichek.
[01:21:06.908 --> 01:21:08.069]  Now, how would you know that?
[01:21:08.769 --> 01:21:10.651]  How would anybody in the audience know that?
[01:21:10.711 --> 01:21:20.018]  Because he purposefully brings you distortion, displacement, and he gives you a false notion of what he's all about.
[01:21:20.038 --> 01:21:22.639]  Sure, he's probably banging five chicks a day, exactly.
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:24.641]  Whatever he's telling you is the opposite.
[01:21:25.498 --> 01:21:27.121]  Well, it's not only the opposite.
[01:21:27.161 --> 01:21:31.628]  You don't even know his loyalty has nothing to do with the United States.
[01:21:31.708 --> 01:21:33.611]  It has to do with covert operations.
[01:21:33.671 --> 01:21:34.052]  Exactly.
[01:21:34.072 --> 01:21:36.316]  He's owned by some little private carved out group.
[01:21:37.412 --> 01:21:47.839]  It's not only private, it's also our political group, the CIA, that uses another private group in order to protect or create this candidate.
[01:21:47.999 --> 01:21:54.463]  Let's look at CIA factions, because it's the big intelligence agency and the one tied into globalism.
[01:21:54.483 --> 01:21:56.645]  Obviously there's different factions and things.
[01:21:59.065 --> 01:22:07.317]  Clearly they don't like the way things are going, but then most people I've ever interviewed from the CIA don't even like what the CIA is doing, so who really runs it today?
[01:22:08.806 --> 01:22:10.347]  There's 16 different people.
[01:22:10.387 --> 01:22:13.330]  The DNI, the Director of National Intelligence, is a joke.
[01:22:13.430 --> 01:22:19.455]  In other words, Bush created it as a way to cover over 16 different intelligence organizations.
[01:22:19.835 --> 01:22:21.256]  Do I need the NSA?
[01:22:21.296 --> 01:22:24.339]  Do I need the NGA or National Geospatial Agency?
[01:22:24.419 --> 01:22:30.664]  What I really need is a general like Nakasone in the White House who can control
[01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:34.123]  Cyber is the interface to all of it.
[01:22:34.203 --> 01:22:34.723]  It's what unifies it.
[01:22:34.744 --> 01:22:35.544]  I don't need a tank.
[01:22:35.584 --> 01:22:36.305]  I don't need a Navy.
[01:22:36.325 --> 01:22:38.007]  I don't need the nuclear subs anymore.
[01:22:38.027 --> 01:22:40.209]  No, you need information dominance.
[01:22:54.161 --> 01:22:54.722]  Correct.
[01:22:54.982 --> 01:23:01.789]  And I need people like you to begin to explain to the public that we're getting a hundred million hits a day as you have.
[01:23:02.349 --> 01:23:03.050]  I get hit.
[01:23:03.490 --> 01:23:08.255]  You know, Google makes sure that I don't get any remuneration or whatever.
[01:23:08.295 --> 01:23:08.976]  That's fine.
[01:23:09.036 --> 01:23:10.257]  That's a whole other subject.
[01:23:10.357 --> 01:23:12.920]  Now Google's blocking Rand Paul's speeches.
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:15.082]  This has got to stop.
[01:23:16.559 --> 01:23:17.280]  It's fascism.
[01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:22.104]  What you have here is the creations of corporate fascism.
[01:23:22.705 --> 01:23:26.008]  Or what some people used to call socialist fascism.
[01:23:26.048 --> 01:23:26.929]  But this is fascism.
[01:23:26.949 --> 01:23:29.031]  Yeah, and why does Trump put up with that?
[01:23:29.111 --> 01:23:31.333]  Why is he like, this is out of control.
[01:23:32.355 --> 01:23:34.497]  Well, it's not an accident.
[01:23:34.597 --> 01:23:39.380]  Google was created by one Russian Jew who I helped to get out of the Soviet Union.
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:40.921]  And what did he create in Google?
[01:23:41.401 --> 01:23:43.823]  A reincarnation of the Soviet Union.
[01:23:44.203 --> 01:23:46.385]  Control, denial, and distortion.
[01:23:46.825 --> 01:23:48.126]  That's exactly what he did.
[01:23:48.506 --> 01:23:49.807]  But nobody monitored him.
[01:23:49.887 --> 01:23:51.128]  I've said it for 20 years.
[01:23:51.228 --> 01:23:57.633]  Google is nothing more than another fascist organization which you can take down if you know how to do it.
[01:23:58.228 --> 01:24:02.069]  Through the IRS or through other means, or if you have to do cyber?
[01:24:02.110 --> 01:24:03.230]  They're in bed with China.
[01:24:03.250 --> 01:24:04.410]  They're so easy to stop.
[01:24:04.510 --> 01:24:05.451]  Why won't Trump do it?
[01:24:06.991 --> 01:24:08.492]  That I can't tell you, my friend.
[01:24:08.692 --> 01:24:11.613]  I wish he would understand what Apple's about.
[01:24:11.713 --> 01:24:12.734]  Complete China.
[01:24:12.974 --> 01:24:15.715]  Huawei is a disaster.
[01:24:15.755 --> 01:24:24.678]  Within the past 30 years, I went from a rickshaw in China to fast cars in modern cities in Beijing.
[01:24:24.998 --> 01:24:27.059]  And now they have the 5G, and we don't.
[01:24:27.788 --> 01:24:30.634]  And we don't have the cyber capacity that they do.
[01:24:31.075 --> 01:24:32.518]  And we don't have the internet capacity.
[01:24:32.538 --> 01:24:36.427]  Because bureaucracy was set up to block our development and greenlit their development.
[01:24:37.614 --> 01:24:38.935]  Well, you can say that.
[01:24:39.315 --> 01:24:43.996]  Our businesses have become so big, the government is becoming irrelevant.
[01:24:44.096 --> 01:24:47.718]  That's what Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats are beginning to understand.
[01:24:47.758 --> 01:24:54.400]  Yeah, that's what you said, because the NSA is Google, and is Apple, and is Twitter, and Trump needs to get that too.
[01:24:54.420 --> 01:24:55.601]  He's like, oh, they're private companies.
[01:24:55.661 --> 01:24:56.361]  What the hell?
[01:24:56.381 --> 01:24:58.582]  The frickin' government built the damn things.
[01:24:58.802 --> 01:24:59.362]  We'll be right back.
[01:24:59.382 --> 01:24:59.802]  That's correct.
[01:25:00.543 --> 01:25:03.304]  We'll do a few more minutes with Dr. Steve McKinnick, SteveMcKinnick.com.
[01:25:04.409 --> 01:25:05.149]  Real stuff, man.
[01:25:05.189 --> 01:25:06.310]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[01:25:06.350 --> 01:25:11.771]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits here and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[01:25:11.811 --> 01:25:14.012]  Everybody, I mean, I've got a problem.
[01:25:14.672 --> 01:25:16.192]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[01:25:16.332 --> 01:25:18.393]  We've got a whole plan ready off the shelf.
[01:25:18.413 --> 01:25:19.393]  We can launch it in three weeks.
[01:25:19.793 --> 01:25:20.553]  I'm just telling the president.
[01:25:23.274 --> 01:25:26.315]  OK, so most people that have political power
[01:25:27.577 --> 01:25:31.698]  Try to leverage it right away and try to ask for money or some political position.
[01:25:32.458 --> 01:25:33.119]  I'm from Texas.
[01:25:33.139 --> 01:25:33.999]  I'm from the grassroots.
[01:25:34.639 --> 01:25:39.180]  I want to create alternate systems for my progeny and for your progeny.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.761]  I don't want to control things.
[01:25:41.421 --> 01:25:43.982]  I don't want to sit around with all those stuff suits and lawyers.
[01:25:45.102 --> 01:25:48.363]  That said, about two months ago I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[01:25:48.883 --> 01:25:53.004]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[01:25:54.325 --> 01:25:55.025]  20 different stickers.
[01:25:56.152 --> 01:26:06.321]  Impeach the Democrats, save the Second Amendment, defend the First Amendment, Infowars.com, and it looks like duct tape, but it's just a regular sticker.
[01:26:06.341 --> 01:26:11.645]  You put it over your mouth, you go to a Trump rally, and you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[01:26:11.665 --> 01:26:12.846]  People say, why are you doing this?
[01:26:13.206 --> 01:26:13.727]  What's happening?
[01:26:13.747 --> 01:26:17.290]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored and, you know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[01:26:18.531 --> 01:26:23.655]  And I can easily have people at every Trump rally, everybody loves us, half as people are our folks, or more.
[01:26:26.867 --> 01:26:28.188]  Like, take CPAC or something.
[01:26:28.228 --> 01:26:33.611]  They're a bunch of blue-blood kiss-asses who aren't even conservative, and everyone bows down to the bureaucracy.
[01:26:33.671 --> 01:26:36.353]  And so I'm not threatening the President with something.
[01:26:37.093 --> 01:26:46.419]  I'm simply saying we're not going to sit here and watch our grassroots movement that got you into office be overtaken by a bunch of special interests.
[01:26:46.439 --> 01:26:47.199]  We're just not going to do it.
[01:26:47.219 --> 01:26:53.303]  So we're loyal opposition here, but we just want the President to know this plan will work.
[01:26:54.508 --> 01:26:56.249]  I can take over the Trump rallies right now.
[01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:59.291]  Something the Democrats could never do, because I have the people.
[01:26:59.351 --> 01:27:00.092]  They know I'm real.
[01:27:00.732 --> 01:27:07.536]  And Dr. Pachinik, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not launched this yet, because I just don't want a showboat like this.
[01:27:07.616 --> 01:27:17.903]  But with the stuff I'm seeing and the Justice Department announcing they're not going to go after Google for antitrust, I just feel like it's my duty to go ahead and probably start pulling the trigger on this.
[01:27:17.943 --> 01:27:18.323]  What do you think?
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:21.842]  I have no objection to it.
[01:27:21.882 --> 01:27:26.266]  I think it's a brilliant maneuver because silence becomes your weapon.
[01:27:26.887 --> 01:27:31.231]  And if they want to understand why you're silent, you read it right.
[01:27:31.371 --> 01:27:32.772]  I think it's brilliant what you're doing.
[01:27:33.132 --> 01:27:34.313]  You're not disrupting.
[01:27:34.754 --> 01:27:36.876]  You're in no way offending anybody.
[01:27:37.016 --> 01:27:42.141]  You're basically stating your view and you have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[01:27:42.321 --> 01:27:44.523]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[01:27:45.163 --> 01:27:45.664]  Silence.
[01:27:46.528 --> 01:27:48.809]  And that's a brilliant strategy.
[01:27:49.149 --> 01:27:51.190]  You just encapsulated exactly what I mean by it.
[01:27:51.230 --> 01:27:52.431]  So you get what we're trying to do?
[01:27:53.391 --> 01:27:57.814]  Oh, silence is the most lethal weapon that someone can have.
[01:27:58.054 --> 01:28:04.837]  If I go to a meeting and I say nothing, I remember in the State Department, people would always say, well, what do you think?
[01:28:04.937 --> 01:28:06.758]  I said, well, I have nothing to say.
[01:28:07.278 --> 01:28:12.501]  But the minute you look up or the minute you have a tag on your mouth and there's silence,
[01:28:13.266 --> 01:28:16.108]  That's penetrating because there are two elements.
[01:28:16.448 --> 01:28:17.788]  One, you're silent.
[01:28:17.888 --> 01:28:22.891]  And two, you're intrusive with a strategy saying, this is what I would like to have.
[01:28:23.571 --> 01:28:24.692]  You don't say anything.
[01:28:25.012 --> 01:28:27.714]  People can say, oh, that's absurd or looks silly.
[01:28:28.094 --> 01:28:30.175]  And the answer is, you don't do anything.
[01:28:30.695 --> 01:28:39.366]  And so in no way can you be considered an agitprop, agitation propaganda, or anything offensive.
[01:28:39.687 --> 01:28:43.712]  It's basically the most, I think it's brilliant the way you thought about it.
[01:28:44.172 --> 01:28:46.696]  Number one, you stand there, you say nothing.
[01:28:47.296 --> 01:28:50.579]  Put it on your mouth and basically you're making a statement.
[01:28:50.939 --> 01:28:52.641]  There's no way you can be offensive.
[01:28:52.981 --> 01:28:53.602]  I don't see it.
[01:28:54.102 --> 01:28:56.164]  Well, that's really what you're getting at the heart of it.
[01:28:56.224 --> 01:28:59.007]  I don't want to come in there like I want something like a pig at the trough.
[01:28:59.087 --> 01:29:00.548]  I'm just saying, hey, we've already been silenced.
[01:29:00.808 --> 01:29:01.289]  Here we are.
[01:29:01.609 --> 01:29:03.270]  We're represented by the fact we're silenced.
[01:29:03.310 --> 01:29:03.651]  Here we are.
[01:29:04.704 --> 01:29:05.205]  That's true.
[01:29:05.465 --> 01:29:09.852]  And silence, what you've done, Alex, in a way that's brilliant.
[01:29:10.253 --> 01:29:17.064]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that silence, and made it into a weapon.
[01:29:17.405 --> 01:29:18.086]  Think about it.
[01:29:18.792 --> 01:29:20.752]  You should be head of our intelligence units.
[01:29:20.812 --> 01:29:22.453]  That's a brilliant way to look at it.
[01:29:22.893 --> 01:29:33.575]  You take the very part of suppression, silence, and you make it into a weapon, and then you put just a tag saying, this is what I believe in, but I won't state it.
[01:29:34.555 --> 01:29:35.176]  You know what it is.
[01:29:35.336 --> 01:29:36.976]  Necessity is the mother of invention.
[01:29:37.016 --> 01:29:37.996]  We're the grassroots.
[01:29:38.056 --> 01:29:41.057]  We have to, just like you do, we have to innovate.
[01:29:41.097 --> 01:29:43.858]  We don't live in the lawyer fantasy land, ivory towers.
[01:29:43.898 --> 01:29:45.938]  We have to be real or we fail.
[01:29:46.897 --> 01:29:48.098]  Well, there's a simple reason.
[01:29:48.118 --> 01:29:50.681]  Do you have a pension that's guaranteed, Alex?
[01:29:50.741 --> 01:29:50.921]  No.
[01:29:52.022 --> 01:29:54.985]  Neither do I. That's why we are what we are.
[01:30:05.043 --> 01:30:06.804]  All right, Dr. Steve McHennick is our guest.
[01:30:06.824 --> 01:30:08.944]  SteveMcHennick.com, Alex Jones, your host.
[01:30:09.365 --> 01:30:10.785]  Very honored to be here with all of you.
[01:30:11.245 --> 01:30:16.227]  Coming up in about 50 minutes, we've got Roger Stone's personal lawyer coming on.
[01:30:16.647 --> 01:30:18.168]  And I had to pull teeth to do this.
[01:30:19.168 --> 01:30:24.010]  And I don't know how much he can say, but you're going to get exclusive stuff coming up next hour.
[01:30:24.710 --> 01:30:29.372]  Barr installs outside prosecutor to review case against Michael Flynn, ex-Trump advisor.
[01:30:30.272 --> 01:30:31.292]  That's the New York Times.
[01:30:31.613 --> 01:30:32.433]  We also have
[01:30:34.266 --> 01:30:40.609]  This letter coming out today, saying there'll be no criminal prosecution of Andrew G. McCabe.
[01:30:43.029 --> 01:30:49.252]  That's a Valentine's gift to the deep state, in my view, Dr. Puccini.
[01:30:49.612 --> 01:30:51.793]  What do you see in the symbolism of that?
[01:30:54.053 --> 01:30:57.854]  My attitude is pretty much this.
[01:30:58.614 --> 01:31:04.515]  I am not a fan, nor have I ever been a fan, of the Department of Justice for well over 30, 40 years.
[01:31:04.775 --> 01:31:07.375]  I don't find them to be impartial.
[01:31:07.695 --> 01:31:20.378]  I find that most of the lawyers or prosecutors who come in at any given time are really political entities who have served one way or another, and this is the key, in a Washington firm.
[01:31:20.638 --> 01:31:22.818]  In other words, most of them will look at
[01:31:23.970 --> 01:31:27.832]  You look at their resume and you will see they've worked in a Washington firm.
[01:31:27.872 --> 01:31:29.033]  They come out of Harvard.
[01:31:29.093 --> 01:31:30.253]  They come out of Yale.
[01:31:30.794 --> 01:31:34.135]  And for me, I'm not impressed with lawyers.
[01:31:34.756 --> 01:31:37.797]  I've never really used lawyers for litigation.
[01:31:37.957 --> 01:31:40.118]  I've used them as financial instruments.
[01:31:40.738 --> 01:31:47.662]  In other words, in the system that I was working in, either in the law or in publishing, their job was very simple.
[01:31:47.742 --> 01:31:50.223]  I don't want to know what's right or wrong from them.
[01:31:50.403 --> 01:31:52.144]  I just wanted them to make more money.
[01:31:52.745 --> 01:31:57.528]  So basically a lawyer to me is kind of a secondhand element.
[01:31:57.848 --> 01:32:02.490]  I don't really need lawyers in the world of cyber command and cyber communications.
[01:32:02.951 --> 01:32:04.511]  They're totally unnecessary.
[01:32:05.012 --> 01:32:10.875]  They think they're necessary and they become a key element of our system.
[01:32:11.415 --> 01:32:17.163]  But remember, we're 260 years old and we're moving at a very fast exponential rate.
[01:32:17.683 --> 01:32:24.211]  I don't see a need for judges who are basically ex-lawyers who are politically active.
[01:32:28.357 --> 01:32:32.620]  Obviously there was a big, organic, populist, deep state.
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:37.204]  A mom taking care of her children in the morning, making them biscuits and gravy is the real deep state.
[01:32:37.244 --> 01:32:39.946]  Or a cop doing his job, changing an old lady's tire.
[01:32:40.266 --> 01:32:41.567]  Or a doctor doing their job.
[01:32:41.608 --> 01:32:42.488]  That's the real deep state.
[01:32:42.528 --> 01:32:43.829]  It's just rubber meets the road.
[01:32:45.050 --> 01:32:52.755]  Obviously, if the corrupt elements of the deep state keep trying to start a fight and get the fight they want, they should pray for Donald Trump's success.
[01:32:53.215 --> 01:32:59.138]  America is so awake now, the military is so awake, everybody I know is so awake, and they don't want to go out and start having a civil war.
[01:32:59.478 --> 01:33:03.841]  But if the Communists and the Democrats and the Bernie Sanders of the world think they're going to have...
[01:33:04.321 --> 01:33:06.384]  This big happy hunting ground in America?
[01:33:06.424 --> 01:33:08.426]  It's not going to go the way it did in Russia or other places.
[01:33:08.807 --> 01:33:11.190]  I don't think they realize how much danger they're in.
[01:33:11.210 --> 01:33:12.031]  Can you speak to that?
[01:33:12.071 --> 01:33:16.055]  If things were to go into a civil war, I don't see it going well for the other side.
[01:33:17.397 --> 01:33:18.558]  There won't be a Civil War.
[01:33:18.618 --> 01:33:22.799]  Number one, there aren't enough people on the Democratic or the Socialist side.
[01:33:22.919 --> 01:33:33.903]  Bernie Sanders will probably win, but as I've said a long time ago, and I've heard Bernie, you have to be a multimillionaire to be able to say you're a Socialist or a Communist.
[01:33:34.043 --> 01:33:38.244]  I've never met any Communist or Socialist who was not a multimillionaire.
[01:33:38.844 --> 01:33:49.033]  So the inherent contradiction of Bernie Sanders and what he stands for is nice in terms of the fluff and the need to motivate teenagers and young people.
[01:33:49.053 --> 01:33:49.654]  Yeah, the fantasy land.
[01:33:50.695 --> 01:33:51.896]  But it's fantasy land.
[01:33:51.976 --> 01:33:52.877]  He knows it.
[01:33:53.577 --> 01:33:55.059]  Michael Bloomberg knows it.
[01:33:55.099 --> 01:33:56.900]  The Democratic Party knows it.
[01:33:56.960 --> 01:34:00.624]  But basically, it's the end of a Democratic Party.
[01:34:00.824 --> 01:34:01.805]  That's really what it is.
[01:34:01.825 --> 01:34:02.405]  And it really is.
[01:34:02.425 --> 01:34:03.386]  So how do you see them ending?
[01:34:03.426 --> 01:34:04.347]  Because you're right.
[01:34:04.387 --> 01:34:05.468]  I mean, it's coming to an end.
[01:34:06.443 --> 01:34:09.946]  I said it a year ago when Nancy Pelosi was out of control.
[01:34:11.027 --> 01:34:14.991]  I said it on your show when I said Biden was demented.
[01:34:15.471 --> 01:34:16.652]  And everybody thought I was.
[01:34:16.933 --> 01:34:17.633]  No, you're right.
[01:34:17.713 --> 01:34:19.595]  And we got censored on Facebook because of that interview.
[01:34:20.176 --> 01:34:21.597]  Your interview with me got us banned again.
[01:34:21.837 --> 01:34:23.198]  But now it's all prima facie.
[01:34:23.238 --> 01:34:23.779]  It's all admitted.
[01:34:25.592 --> 01:34:26.993]  But he is demented.
[01:34:27.474 --> 01:34:28.454]  He came in last.
[01:34:28.494 --> 01:34:29.795]  He didn't know where he was.
[01:34:29.855 --> 01:34:31.137]  He didn't know what he was saying.
[01:34:31.197 --> 01:34:32.698]  He just keeps yelling at people.
[01:34:32.718 --> 01:34:38.102]  And the fact that they would keep him in the field when he's acting like that shows the lights are on but nobody's home.
[01:34:39.083 --> 01:34:40.284]  Well, but that's the point.
[01:34:40.664 --> 01:34:49.191]  And you want the Democratic Party to spend millions to Dewey Square and a whole bunch of consultants who are totally useless.
[01:34:49.804 --> 01:34:58.628]  What's happening is you and I are becoming the alternative world to what's in the media, what's the fake news, the CNNs.
[01:34:58.868 --> 01:34:59.868]  All of them, they're gone.
[01:35:00.329 --> 01:35:01.589]  Hollywood is gone.
[01:35:01.909 --> 01:35:07.872]  When you're paying $180 million for a junk film like The Irishman, you're finished.
[01:35:07.892 --> 01:35:09.553]  Well, that's my last question for you.
[01:35:10.633 --> 01:35:16.635]  Obviously, a delusional like Karl Rove saying, we're history's actors now, we control reality, and we'll give you a new reality tomorrow.
[01:35:16.695 --> 01:35:26.439]  But if you've got history on your side, and you're telling the truth, and you're in the path of history, like Julius Caesar Shakespeare, there's a tide in the fares of men when taking the flood leads on to fortune.
[01:35:26.879 --> 01:35:30.420]  If we go with the tide of what's right and true, we are history's actors.
[01:35:30.840 --> 01:35:32.841]  Here's Karl Rove's statement to the New York Times bragging,
[01:35:33.661 --> 01:35:34.581]  We're an empire now.
[01:35:35.462 --> 01:35:37.523]  When we act, we create our own reality.
[01:35:37.603 --> 01:35:47.466]  And when you're studying that reality judiciously, as you will, we will act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that how things will sort out.
[01:35:47.906 --> 01:35:49.227]  We're history's actors now.
[01:35:49.447 --> 01:35:52.648]  All of you, all of you will be left to just study what we do.
[01:35:52.688 --> 01:36:02.172]  But now it's the bureaucracy and the lawyers and the Democrats and the bluebloods that are literally having to watch what we do just because we're doing what's normal.
[01:36:03.533 --> 01:36:06.917]  And so his own prophecy about them has now been turned against him.
[01:36:07.638 --> 01:36:10.461]  Final statements on who history's real actors are.
[01:36:11.603 --> 01:36:14.827]  The real actors of history are the insignificant ones.
[01:36:14.987 --> 01:36:16.929]  The alternative ones like you and me.
[01:36:16.989 --> 01:36:20.333]  Karl Rove will be in history alright for the most part.
[01:36:20.769 --> 01:36:31.294]  Incompetent, stupid, self-aggrandizing individual who brought us the worst president of the United States in the past 40 years, George Bush Jr.
[01:36:31.434 --> 01:36:34.795]  and Cheney, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[01:36:34.855 --> 01:36:41.258]  What we haven't done so far, and this is why I plead on your show, we have to hold people accountable.
[01:36:41.818 --> 01:36:49.206]  People have to go to prison and have to have a day in the sun where there's accountability for killing other people.
[01:36:49.627 --> 01:36:52.350]  The Mike Flynn's of the world didn't kill anybody.
[01:36:52.410 --> 01:36:53.691]  They had some intelligence.
[01:36:53.751 --> 01:36:55.974]  Roger Stone never killed anybody.
[01:36:56.534 --> 01:36:57.776]  But Bush Jr.
[01:36:57.876 --> 01:36:58.176]  did.
[01:36:58.416 --> 01:36:59.317]  Cheney did.
[01:36:59.477 --> 01:37:00.639]  Karl Rove did.
[01:37:01.079 --> 01:37:01.300]  Thank you.
[01:37:18.863 --> 01:37:25.965]  And unfortunately, China and Russia will be far more successful than we are, because our students are better trained there.
[01:37:26.425 --> 01:37:28.506]  Our students don't speak the languages.
[01:37:28.566 --> 01:37:34.608]  When I went to Beijing... Well, the left sabotaged America to rule it, and then they sabotaged their main power base.
[01:37:35.469 --> 01:37:35.829]  Correct.
[01:37:35.949 --> 01:37:42.774]  And what they did was to really cripple our country by saying diversity supersedes competency.
[01:37:42.914 --> 01:37:53.922]  And in China, the most powerful weapon I had ever seen was a 10-story bookstore filled with only English and American books with all Chinese young people reading it.
[01:37:54.202 --> 01:37:57.764]  I don't know one store here that has... No, right.
[01:37:57.824 --> 01:38:01.407]  They're devouring the classics and then we've just abandoned them.
[01:38:02.213 --> 01:38:02.513]  Correct.
[01:38:02.693 --> 01:38:05.294]  And we need a strong education system.
[01:38:05.375 --> 01:38:17.480]  If I were Trump, I would fire the entire Department of Education, start over again, and mandate that every state has to work on intelligence and competency, not diversity.
[01:38:17.760 --> 01:38:21.102]  I'm not interested in whether you're black, white, yellow, green.
[01:38:21.482 --> 01:38:22.403]  I'm Hispanic.
[01:38:22.523 --> 01:38:23.723]  I came out of Cuba.
[01:38:24.884 --> 01:38:25.564]  Martin Luther King Jr.
[01:38:25.584 --> 01:38:27.205]  said it's about what you can produce.
[01:38:28.055 --> 01:38:28.495]  Correct.
[01:38:28.635 --> 01:38:42.560]  And what you can give to our country, and I will mandate that every young person has to serve our country, not necessarily in war, but I don't care where their service is, but like Israel, you will serve us for two years.
[01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:45.301]  I would reinstitute a service to this country.
[01:38:46.525 --> 01:38:47.226]  And thank you.
[01:38:47.626 --> 01:38:49.227]  All right, Dr. Pachinik, stevepachinik.com.
[01:38:49.287 --> 01:38:50.248]  Powerful interview.
[01:38:50.288 --> 01:38:53.170]  I hope the president listens to you because we didn't even get into this.
[01:38:53.190 --> 01:38:54.330]  You should come back in a week or so.
[01:38:54.370 --> 01:38:58.233]  We should get into the Epstein thing and every angle and Barr, because it's true.
[01:38:58.673 --> 01:39:00.455]  Barr is presiding over the cover-up of that.
[01:39:01.475 --> 01:39:01.876]  Correct.
[01:39:02.396 --> 01:39:06.118]  And thank you and your audience for allowing me to speak.
[01:39:06.198 --> 01:39:11.082]  And I want Roger Stonefreed and I want Mike Flynn free and anybody else.
[01:39:11.522 --> 01:39:12.663]  And I agree with Tucker Carlson, though.
[01:39:12.703 --> 01:39:14.444]  It repudiates the whole Russiagate hoax.
[01:39:14.604 --> 01:39:15.565]  You have to do it right there.
[01:39:18.679 --> 01:39:19.239]  I know you know.
[01:39:19.279 --> 01:39:19.900]  I'm telling the audience.
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:20.280]  Thank you.
[01:39:20.840 --> 01:39:23.802]  Okay, we have our next guest coming on from the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[01:39:24.102 --> 01:39:24.922]  Really smart guy.
[01:39:24.962 --> 01:39:27.163]  Get his take on what's happening in the world.
[01:39:27.903 --> 01:39:29.264]  Ivan Reikland, straight ahead.
[01:39:29.284 --> 01:39:32.506]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[01:39:32.526 --> 01:39:33.446]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:39:35.367 --> 01:39:39.409]  Ivan Reikland is a former Green Beret and formerly worked with the Defense Intelligence Agency.
[01:39:39.909 --> 01:39:42.010]  He's also a recovering lawyer, as he calls it.
[01:39:42.911 --> 01:39:44.972]  And he joins us to
[01:39:46.331 --> 01:39:48.191]  Talk about a whole host of subjects.
[01:39:48.231 --> 01:39:50.652]  He's at Raiklin on Twitter.
[01:39:50.892 --> 01:39:52.752]  R-A-I-K-L-I-N.
[01:39:53.233 --> 01:39:58.214]  So, I wanted him to send me a list of things to get into because I met this guy a couple years ago at a press conference in D.C.
[01:39:58.674 --> 01:39:59.854]  Really liked the speech he gave.
[01:39:59.874 --> 01:40:00.774]  Been meaning to get him on.
[01:40:00.794 --> 01:40:01.554]  He's finally here.
[01:40:02.755 --> 01:40:08.876]  And he wants to get into Roger Stone, General Flynn, loony left, corrupt FBI, deep state, election fraud, which I would put up front.
[01:40:10.036 --> 01:40:10.897]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:40:10.977 --> 01:40:11.977]  I see you're there in your car.
[01:40:13.161 --> 01:40:14.822]  Probably somewhere in Virginia or something.
[01:40:15.343 --> 01:40:20.386]  But Ivan, what would you call this period in American history we are in right now?
[01:40:20.466 --> 01:40:21.467]  Because it's just crazy.
[01:40:24.469 --> 01:40:26.911]  As far as one word, I think it's completely ridiculous.
[01:40:27.111 --> 01:40:37.318]  Just a little bit about myself and why I wanted to kind of jump on and join in the conversation is that my parents fled the Soviet Union back in the 70s to run away from communism and socialism.
[01:40:37.818 --> 01:40:39.880]  I would never have thought 40 years later
[01:40:40.455 --> 01:40:49.980]  That I would be helping fight communism and socialism that is coming from the left with all the squad and all the Bernie Sanders activity going on in this presidential cycle.
[01:40:50.021 --> 01:40:51.381]  It is completely ridiculous.
[01:40:51.401 --> 01:41:00.326]  Well that's why, no exactly, so your ethos is your family tried to escape tyranny and now you're like literally, you've seen it before and here it is in your face.
[01:41:01.687 --> 01:41:06.290]  Right, I hate to say it this way but as a Green Beret the motto is free the oppressed.
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:12.521]  And now, being a resident of Virginia, they have the motto of Six Emperor Tyrannus, which is down with tyrants.
[01:41:13.221 --> 01:41:16.542]  And not only nor them, we can talk about a litany of issues.
[01:41:16.562 --> 01:41:17.622]  I don't know how much time you have.
[01:41:17.642 --> 01:41:20.223]  I have all the time in the world, if you let me.
[01:41:21.003 --> 01:41:21.763]  Roll with it.
[01:41:21.783 --> 01:41:22.683]  You're a smart guy.
[01:41:23.343 --> 01:41:26.764]  People need to understand who haven't... Bernie Sanders says we need food lines.
[01:41:26.804 --> 01:41:27.644]  We don't need choice.
[01:41:27.964 --> 01:41:29.445]  He says that's poverty.
[01:41:29.705 --> 01:41:29.945]  Really?
[01:41:31.065 --> 01:41:31.945]  Explain what we're facing.
[01:41:32.245 --> 01:41:35.186]  You've seen it, your family's seen it, and now here it is yet again.
[01:41:37.552 --> 01:41:38.312]  Right, absolutely.
[01:41:38.372 --> 01:41:43.055]  I mean, I was born here in the States, so I didn't see it personally, but my family, like you said, saw it.
[01:41:43.735 --> 01:41:46.576]  And it comes down to capitalism always works.
[01:41:46.736 --> 01:41:53.119]  The market will always work itself out in order to be able to provide the most value and most benefit and good to society.
[01:41:53.139 --> 01:41:56.861]  I mean, it's got problems, but it'll produce a hundred times more than communism.
[01:41:59.002 --> 01:41:59.602]  What's that, Alex?
[01:42:00.322 --> 01:42:03.364]  It's got problems, but it'll produce a hundred times more than communism.
[01:42:03.384 --> 01:42:05.665]  A hundred times, easily.
[01:42:07.009 --> 01:42:11.792]  So, yeah, I just wanted to come on if you wanted to talk about the situation with General Flanders.
[01:42:11.832 --> 01:42:12.632]  No, I mean, get into your parents.
[01:42:12.673 --> 01:42:15.154]  Let's see the rest of the segment on your parents fleeing the Soviet Union.
[01:42:15.174 --> 01:42:15.734]  Talk about that.
[01:42:17.315 --> 01:42:17.696]  Oh, sure.
[01:42:17.736 --> 01:42:22.759]  So, in the 1970s and 74, my parents fled the Soviet Union.
[01:42:22.979 --> 01:42:28.802]  My father from Leningrad, which is obviously changed names later on to St.
[01:42:28.842 --> 01:42:34.526]  Petersburg, and then my mother from the Far East, they fled in the 74, went through a system where
[01:42:37.133 --> 01:42:57.526]  There was the lobby in the United States that was facilitating the movement under Jackson... I'm not sure if you're old enough to remember, but the Jackson-Vanik Amendment allowed for Soviet Jews to depart the Soviet Union in return for the assistance with grain distribution throughout Russia and the different republics.
[01:42:57.946 --> 01:43:06.011]  So under that strategic system, my parents were able to come into the United States legally, mind you, unlike a lot of these folks.
[01:43:06.801 --> 01:43:09.322]  Uh, and come into the United States and seek the American Dream.
[01:43:10.042 --> 01:43:11.562]  There you go, Jackson-Vanik Amendment.
[01:43:13.463 --> 01:43:17.364]  What does your, what does your dad, what does your mom describe in the Soviet Union, why they didn't like it?
[01:43:19.325 --> 01:43:28.287]  Well, both of them have passed in the last couple years, but, uh, when growing up, a lot of the things that they discussed with me was, uh, you know,
[01:43:29.056 --> 01:43:34.339]  Everybody there essentially had one channel that they received all their information from.
[01:43:34.799 --> 01:43:37.121]  They were essentially lemmings to the state.
[01:43:37.721 --> 01:43:44.005]  And then the only way to really get away from that lemming mindset was to turn off the TV and drink yourself to death.
[01:43:44.605 --> 01:43:48.187]  So vodka, alcohol, this was back in the 60s and 70s.
[01:43:50.929 --> 01:43:52.089]  What do you think of Putin today?
[01:43:52.109 --> 01:43:53.370]  I mean, I think he's a nationalist.
[01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:54.671]  I think he's helping Russia.
[01:43:56.857 --> 01:43:58.378]  Right, I mean, you have to look at it in context.
[01:43:58.478 --> 01:44:01.901]  So a lot of people say content is king, but I think context is ace.
[01:44:02.301 --> 01:44:12.168]  In the context of Russia, in the Yeltsin years, in the 1990s, you had a president, Yeltsin at the time, who was a bumbling drunk.
[01:44:12.749 --> 01:44:16.451]  And essentially, that's what the country looked like, complete chaos.
[01:44:16.551 --> 01:44:17.152]  And that's not
[01:44:17.836 --> 01:44:19.557]  I mean, in the interest of U.S.
[01:44:19.597 --> 01:44:26.641]  national security, you don't want to have a strong, powerful, nuclear-capable country that is in complete chaos.
[01:44:26.761 --> 01:44:30.062]  You want to have an ability to somehow negotiate with a stable partner.
[01:44:30.583 --> 01:44:31.023]  And I think
[01:44:31.567 --> 01:44:43.415]  You know, in some aspects, obviously, Russia and Putin is a strategic competitor in many regards, but on some fronts, they are a strategic partner, especially when it comes down to... Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:43.435 --> 01:44:47.058]  Hollywood's trying to corrupt our children.
[01:44:47.338 --> 01:44:48.279]  Putin is against that.
[01:44:48.379 --> 01:44:57.105]  So I believe moral issues and ideology trumps geography and trumps everything else.
[01:44:57.685 --> 01:45:06.767]  And I don't see leaders that are opposing things like Putin is, so I'm not scared to say that I agree with what Putin's doing, defending the Russian families, rebuilding their population.
[01:45:06.807 --> 01:45:07.687]  That's what we need here.
[01:45:08.287 --> 01:45:08.767]  I like that.
[01:45:08.967 --> 01:45:09.387]  I like that.
[01:45:10.027 --> 01:45:11.688]  And I see him as a competitor.
[01:45:12.208 --> 01:45:13.848]  I want to adopt the things that Putin's done.
[01:45:16.069 --> 01:45:16.229]  Right.
[01:45:16.269 --> 01:45:23.270]  In the grand scheme of things, I would say, as a shorthand, Russia is known for several things over the last few hundred years.
[01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:27.391]  Literature, culture, and their intelligence services, right?
[01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:37.213]  So the first two are positive, in the sense of contributing to humanity, and the last one, depending on where you are, if you're an American, then that's an adversarial role.
[01:45:37.273 --> 01:45:41.194]  So, you kind of have to interact with Russia, understanding those three dynamics.
[01:45:43.035 --> 01:45:47.696]  I agree with you, but I just don't see, I'm not a Russophile either, I don't see Russia as the issue.
[01:45:48.016 --> 01:45:50.217]  I see Hollywood and the left as the cancer.
[01:45:50.877 --> 01:45:52.978]  If Russia was messing with us, I'd say go to war with Russia.
[01:45:53.198 --> 01:45:56.899]  But I don't see Russia encroaching on my daily life, I see the left doing it.
[01:46:00.387 --> 01:46:01.809]  The left is doing it every day.
[01:46:01.829 --> 01:46:06.133]  They started off by banning you from the digital sphere.
[01:46:06.674 --> 01:46:08.175]  They're banning a lot of other people.
[01:46:08.195 --> 01:46:10.397]  I mean, Laura Loomer, we all know who she is.
[01:46:12.119 --> 01:46:18.506]  It's Nazi sort of communist mentality of muting people that have a different
[01:46:19.435 --> 01:46:24.538]  A vision or a thought process and they try to contribute to the conversation.
[01:46:24.798 --> 01:46:25.379]  Well, that's it.
[01:46:25.419 --> 01:46:29.021]  And then once they mute you... I left off that every day with the mainstream media.
[01:46:29.381 --> 01:46:35.064]  What's my frustration, Ivan, is that once they mute you, they then talk in your voice.
[01:46:36.145 --> 01:46:37.406]  People think, oh, I've just been muted.
[01:46:37.506 --> 01:46:38.366]  No, you've not been muted.
[01:46:39.467 --> 01:46:42.949]  I want to say a couple of things.
[01:46:42.989 --> 01:46:44.390]  So I didn't really know
[01:46:45.478 --> 01:46:55.123]  Because I served in the military for 20 plus years, and while you're in the military, you're focused on your job, you know, 18 hours a day, essentially seven days a week, especially as a Green Beret deployed to different places.
[01:46:55.524 --> 01:46:58.866]  So you don't really focus on the political conversation as much as maybe I should have.
[01:46:59.366 --> 01:47:10.972]  But as I started to get away from my military profession and into the political sphere, and I started to see who the main influencers and contributors were in the political sphere, I stumbled across your name.
[01:47:11.012 --> 01:47:13.494]  I didn't really know who you were, really, until
[01:47:14.238 --> 01:47:18.380]  You know, we met a couple of years ago, but then when you got banned, I really looked at your background.
[01:47:18.440 --> 01:47:20.401]  I didn't realize you had been doing this for 20 years.
[01:47:21.081 --> 01:47:30.786]  And all of a sudden, the day literally, you know this, the day you trended number one in downloads in the App Store on Apple, above CNN,
[01:47:32.136 --> 01:47:33.236]  Is when they muted you.
[01:47:33.536 --> 01:47:35.437]  Because at that point, you became effective.
[01:47:36.437 --> 01:47:45.339]  One of the quotes that Roger Stone uses in his movie, Get Me Roger Stone, he says something to the effect of, you hate me?
[01:47:45.359 --> 01:47:51.760]  I relish that you hate me, because if you didn't hate me, I would not be effective.
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:53.540]  Exactly.
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:54.580]  Raiklen, stay there.
[01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:56.581]  We'll be right back on the other side.
[01:47:56.601 --> 01:47:57.021]  Stay with us.
[01:47:58.226 --> 01:48:01.208]  Okay, so Ivan Reikland is a really interesting guy.
[01:48:01.268 --> 01:48:05.850]  Former Green Beret, Defense Intelligence Agency, formerly lawyer, whole nine yards.
[01:48:06.571 --> 01:48:09.372]  And I've been asking a lot of questions of him here.
[01:48:09.932 --> 01:48:11.553]  Familiar with his work for about four or five years.
[01:48:11.613 --> 01:48:12.754]  Ran to him about three years ago.
[01:48:12.774 --> 01:48:14.135]  Been wanting to get him on the show.
[01:48:14.155 --> 01:48:15.095]  We've got him here with us.
[01:48:15.575 --> 01:48:18.257]  Coming up next hour, Tyler Nixon, Roger Stone's lawyer.
[01:48:19.704 --> 01:48:22.345]  He's going to exclusively join us on air despite threats.
[01:48:22.365 --> 01:48:23.545]  I mean, I've got articles right here.
[01:48:24.185 --> 01:48:27.927]  Arrest Alex Jones, Washington Post, for talking about the Roger Stone trial.
[01:48:29.047 --> 01:48:30.588]  It's not like I'm acting tough here.
[01:48:31.348 --> 01:48:32.928]  If I bow down to this, I'm done.
[01:48:32.948 --> 01:48:35.169]  It's not like I'm going, ah, screw you, judge.
[01:48:35.689 --> 01:48:37.390]  Man, you've got a lot of courage.
[01:48:37.430 --> 01:48:38.250]  A lot of courage?
[01:48:39.630 --> 01:48:40.971]  This is unconstitutional.
[01:48:42.301 --> 01:48:45.303]  The minute I start bowing down to that witch today, I start dying.
[01:48:45.824 --> 01:48:49.746]  So, I always tell listeners, it's not a heroic position to stand up for what's right.
[01:48:50.287 --> 01:48:51.167]  It's the default.
[01:48:51.208 --> 01:48:52.008]  You've got to do it.
[01:48:52.508 --> 01:48:54.350]  And it's just crazy.
[01:48:54.390 --> 01:48:59.554]  You talk about the Special Forces and the Army, you know, free the innocent, stand up for the oppressed.
[01:49:00.174 --> 01:49:01.355]  That's what it's really all about.
[01:49:01.455 --> 01:49:07.660]  And I've always been impressed by military people I know, especially the Green Berets, the Army, a lot of family that was involved in that.
[01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:09.441]  They were just the best people you could ever imagine.
[01:49:09.801 --> 01:49:14.023]  And they just wanted to free the oppressed, but they were always mad at the leadership they had.
[01:49:14.624 --> 01:49:17.285]  I think with Trump, we finally got real leadership.
[01:49:17.305 --> 01:49:23.689]  I don't think Trump's perfect, but before we get to all these topics, you've got Roger Stone, General Flynn, Looney Left, corrupt FBI, deep state election fraud.
[01:49:24.169 --> 01:49:26.050]  Well, what is your gut level approximation?
[01:49:26.370 --> 01:49:29.752]  Not as an army officer, but just as an American citizen of President Trump.
[01:49:29.792 --> 01:49:32.514]  Your real gut view of him, because I respect that view.
[01:49:34.875 --> 01:49:36.396]  My gut feeling is when he
[01:49:37.916 --> 01:49:41.460]  America first really is what resonates the most I think within the military community.
[01:49:42.040 --> 01:49:50.869]  So when you say I'm gonna promote America and I want to make sure that I fund the entire military so that it is second to none globally, that's what resonates the most.
[01:49:52.130 --> 01:49:53.031]  That tells you who he is.
[01:49:55.113 --> 01:49:56.714]  Absolutely, that means the core ethos.
[01:49:58.616 --> 01:50:01.279]  So going back to what you're talking about with the Roger Stone trial,
[01:50:02.250 --> 01:50:18.043]  I don't, when you, if you may Alex, when you talk to his attorney, why don't you ask, how is it possible that the judge puts Roger Stone under a gag order, and how is that, how does that conflict and follow with the First Amendment?
[01:50:18.383 --> 01:50:22.366]  Well you're a lawyer, but I've talked to a bunch of lawyers, it's never been done.
[01:50:23.487 --> 01:50:28.051]  This judge, Jackson, is doing stuff, you're the lawyer, tell us, it's never been done.
[01:50:29.443 --> 01:50:30.567]  It's a rhetorical question.
[01:50:30.587 --> 01:50:31.450]  No, I know it's rhetorical.
[01:50:31.470 --> 01:50:31.992]  You're the lawyer.
[01:50:32.092 --> 01:50:33.015]  Tell us what that means.
[01:50:34.881 --> 01:50:36.602]  Right, so the First Amendment, free speech.
[01:50:37.002 --> 01:50:40.024]  In this instance, you have a judge that puts a gag order on, why?
[01:50:40.444 --> 01:50:42.685]  On all social media posts that he does.
[01:50:43.186 --> 01:50:44.046]  Every single thing.
[01:50:44.086 --> 01:50:47.028]  So now, he's not able to defend himself personally.
[01:50:47.628 --> 01:50:48.789]  Thank you for putting the picture up.
[01:50:48.929 --> 01:50:49.389]  Absolutely.
[01:50:49.789 --> 01:51:00.655]  Literally, you're silencing his ability to defend himself from any smears that are coming from the entire mainstream media and big tech industrial complex.
[01:51:01.215 --> 01:51:01.936]  And then literally,
[01:51:03.010 --> 01:51:03.490]  He's done.
[01:51:03.710 --> 01:51:05.471]  I mean, he's essentially assassinated.
[01:51:05.531 --> 01:51:15.893]  But as humans, not as Americans, but as humans, watching somebody tied up, being stabbed in the gut while they're tied up, it's abhorrent.
[01:51:18.714 --> 01:51:19.774]  Right, this is ridiculous.
[01:51:22.194 --> 01:51:28.496]  I hope and I would hope that the president, ideally on February 20th,
[01:51:29.784 --> 01:51:33.645]  The minute before the sentencing comes down, he pardons Roger Stone.
[01:51:34.425 --> 01:51:35.386]  That would be beautiful.
[01:51:35.406 --> 01:51:36.266]  You're right, that's perfect.
[01:51:36.326 --> 01:51:38.187]  Don't do it after when the judge is powerful.
[01:51:38.527 --> 01:51:39.427]  Do it right before.
[01:51:40.647 --> 01:51:42.148]  Right, and do it via tweet.
[01:51:45.409 --> 01:51:50.070]  That would be the first instance, I think, in the history of our country where somebody's been pardoned by tweet.
[01:51:50.110 --> 01:51:54.011]  Now granted, the paperwork had to follow up through the White House Counsel, etc.
[01:51:54.071 --> 01:51:55.432]  No, officially it'll be, yeah.
[01:51:56.690 --> 01:52:02.314]  No, you're right, because the president needs to stop, all of us need to stop giving authority to the left.
[01:52:02.814 --> 01:52:05.436]  Like, they're the authority and oh, we're worried what they say.
[01:52:05.616 --> 01:52:08.858]  Because I've already discovered, people love it when I'm attacked by the left.
[01:52:08.918 --> 01:52:09.879]  It's like currency.
[01:52:10.299 --> 01:52:13.681]  Instead of, how do we stop the cowing to them?
[01:52:13.701 --> 01:52:16.083]  What do you call that spirit of bowing to somebody?
[01:52:16.103 --> 01:52:22.667]  Right, everybody wants to, I mean, there's actual valid compromise when both sides are
[01:52:23.545 --> 01:52:27.287]  What is the psychology of like crazy people that they think they're invincible?
[01:52:27.368 --> 01:52:31.650]  Because I mean I've got a lot of influence and I'm strong but I'm not overconfident.
[01:52:32.351 --> 01:52:32.831]  What is it about
[01:52:52.930 --> 01:52:59.954]  These, these, these weirdos that they think they're invincible and no matter how many times they lose, they keep attacking, attacking, attacking.
[01:53:00.314 --> 01:53:02.155]  What is the, what is the psychology of that?
[01:53:03.356 --> 01:53:13.982]  Well, I'm not a psychologist, Alex, but I mean, I would say that the fundamental issue there is the reason why they continue to do it is because there are no repercussions for the bad behavior.
[01:53:14.262 --> 01:53:14.663]  Exactly.
[01:53:14.683 --> 01:53:16.564]  They've never been punished.
[01:53:16.584 --> 01:53:18.605]  The bad behavior is never exposed.
[01:53:18.725 --> 01:53:19.646]  It's never uncovered.
[01:53:20.226 --> 01:53:22.027]  You know, by your, by your, uh,
[01:53:22.857 --> 01:53:23.257]  What is it?
[01:53:23.998 --> 01:53:25.218]  The Amazon Post?
[01:53:25.638 --> 01:53:26.498]  Or the DNC?
[01:53:26.518 --> 01:53:27.459]  New York Times?
[01:53:27.859 --> 01:53:28.919]  They're not going to expose it.
[01:53:31.500 --> 01:53:34.561]  So they believe because mainstream media gives them cover.
[01:53:34.581 --> 01:53:35.922]  No, you just said it.
[01:53:36.422 --> 01:53:42.024]  They believe because mainstream media gives them cover that they're... But in the court of public opinion, they're losing.
[01:53:42.324 --> 01:53:49.027]  But because they look at the news and see CNN say they're good, they think they've got to get out of jail free card.
[01:53:49.047 --> 01:53:49.427]  They don't.
[01:53:50.791 --> 01:53:51.191]  Right.
[01:53:52.252 --> 01:53:56.996]  And on the other side, when you scratch your head, it's going to be turned into, oh my gosh, look at him scratching his head.
[01:53:57.036 --> 01:53:57.977]  It's self mutilation.
[01:53:58.017 --> 01:53:59.738]  The worst human on the planet.
[01:53:59.919 --> 01:54:00.539]  Ridiculous.
[01:54:00.959 --> 01:54:02.120]  And that's going to be the headline.
[01:54:02.801 --> 01:54:03.041]  Right.
[01:54:03.902 --> 01:54:04.582]  It's ridiculous.
[01:54:05.063 --> 01:54:13.830]  So anyway, going back to Roger Stone, I just hope that next week, so next week, as far as I was tracking on Thursday, is the sentencing hearing.
[01:54:14.771 --> 01:54:17.693]  And hopefully, I think it's 10 or 11 in the morning in D.C.
[01:54:17.733 --> 01:54:17.933]  here.
[01:54:18.334 --> 01:54:19.675]  I'm not too far away myself.
[01:54:20.499 --> 01:54:26.622]  And I'm just hoping that the President, that morning, sends out his pardon via tweet, and then clears things.
[01:54:27.363 --> 01:54:30.024]  And then, did you see what happened earlier today with Andrew McCabe?
[01:54:30.644 --> 01:54:32.805]  Yeah, they just said, oh- The legal justice system?
[01:54:33.106 --> 01:54:40.429]  Yeah, oh- So Roger Stone gets- Yeah, Roger Stone goes, they're trying to get him into jail for seven to nine years for what?
[01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:47.453]  He didn't recall the exact answer for several of the 500 plus questions that was asked of him.
[01:54:47.958 --> 01:55:05.420]  There is testimony before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and then, you know, if I know somebody for 20 years and I'm just kind of being jocular, you know, shooting the, you know, you know what I mean, shooting the crap with them and say, hey buddy, why do you have to talk bad about me and using expletives in it?
[01:55:06.001 --> 01:55:06.962]  There's no way that
[01:55:07.754 --> 01:55:12.235]  The person he's talking to is gonna feel threatened that Roger's gonna do something to him.
[01:55:12.575 --> 01:55:13.995]  And then you have one of the jurors.
[01:55:14.175 --> 01:55:16.776]  I don't know, you probably already talked about it today on the show.
[01:55:17.116 --> 01:55:22.016]  One of the jurors is a lackey of Donna Brazile and I believe was a politician that ran for Congress.
[01:55:22.036 --> 01:55:23.917]  Oh yeah, she ran for Congress and failed, yeah.
[01:55:23.937 --> 01:55:24.837]  That's ridiculous!
[01:55:25.077 --> 01:55:27.397]  Going back to the first thing you asked me, what are we in?
[01:55:27.677 --> 01:55:30.518]  She told them in jury selection, we have the transcript.
[01:55:31.118 --> 01:55:32.538]  I paid $3,000 for it.
[01:55:33.358 --> 01:55:37.379]  She said, I'm not political in the voir dire.
[01:55:40.131 --> 01:55:41.052]  Jury selection, right?
[01:55:41.172 --> 01:55:41.372]  Yeah.
[01:56:10.973 --> 01:56:13.275]  Or whatever, how are they going to try to take Trump out now?
[01:56:14.936 --> 01:56:17.338]  Well, they're going to do it through the media.
[01:56:17.638 --> 01:56:33.731]  It's the constant influx, whether it's Google, whether it's, you know, any big tech Twitter, they're going to control it so that the information about this lady that is a DNC operative that came out with this post against Roger Stone, it's going to be muted.
[01:56:34.309 --> 01:56:36.111]  So the left is not even going to know it exists.
[01:56:36.151 --> 01:56:40.136]  We're talking about it in a vacuum here because we have the freedom of speech to do so.
[01:56:40.536 --> 01:56:41.617]  But they're not going to see this.
[01:56:42.138 --> 01:56:43.279]  And so it's not going to be relevant.
[01:56:43.299 --> 01:56:43.599]  They're right.
[01:56:43.619 --> 01:56:47.063]  We're in our own little free world here and they're not ever going to see it.
[01:56:49.246 --> 01:56:49.426]  Right.
[01:56:49.446 --> 01:56:51.008]  So the only way to fight back on it is...
[01:56:51.650 --> 01:56:56.077]  It's to create these different platforms that are able to penetrate and create free speech.
[01:56:56.417 --> 01:56:57.118]  Well, that's it.
[01:56:57.138 --> 01:56:58.300]  You just said it.
[01:56:58.380 --> 01:57:01.044]  It's about human action against the censorship.
[01:57:01.064 --> 01:57:01.344]  Okay.
[01:57:01.745 --> 01:57:05.570]  When we come back, loony left, corrupt FBI, deep state, election fraud.
[01:57:05.650 --> 01:57:06.572]  That's the big one.
[01:57:07.012 --> 01:57:14.535]  Trump could literally have 2020 in 262 days stolen from him if he's not aware of it.
[01:57:14.915 --> 01:57:16.916]  And then what does he do once he's aware of it?
[01:57:16.936 --> 01:57:19.177]  Because Soros owns a bunch of machines.
[01:57:19.557 --> 01:57:21.958]  The Democrats are registering illegal aliens everywhere to vote.
[01:57:22.318 --> 01:57:23.339]  How do we counter that?
[01:57:23.399 --> 01:57:24.419]  We come back on the other side.
[01:57:24.439 --> 01:57:25.319]  Because that's it.
[01:57:25.459 --> 01:57:28.181]  Election fraud is, is key bono.
[01:57:29.861 --> 01:57:31.282]  The Republic is strong.
[01:57:32.842 --> 01:57:34.063]  The Republic had been asleep.
[01:57:35.715 --> 01:57:43.171]  Ivan Reikland is our guest, former Green Beret, Defense Intelligence Agency formerly, a lawyer, a smart guy.
[01:57:44.204 --> 01:57:50.927]  We can get into anything you want in these closing times before Roger Stone's lawyer joining us, but election fraud.
[01:57:51.107 --> 01:57:57.570]  That's really the big Achilles heel of Trump and everything else and what's happening in the election.
[01:57:57.630 --> 01:57:58.951]  We've seen Iowa.
[01:57:58.971 --> 01:58:01.352]  We've seen the Democrats stealing stuff.
[01:58:01.492 --> 01:58:03.693]  I hate Bernie Sanders, but he's the guy the Democrats want.
[01:58:03.713 --> 01:58:04.894]  They're stealing it from him again.
[01:58:05.574 --> 01:58:07.875]  So looking at that, is that not front and center?
[01:58:08.195 --> 01:58:09.636]  That really is the ace of spades.
[01:58:09.656 --> 01:58:11.057]  That's a wild card, isn't it, Ivan?
[01:58:13.317 --> 01:58:14.898]  I wouldn't say it's front and center.
[01:58:14.918 --> 01:58:16.159]  I don't know about the wild card.
[01:58:16.219 --> 01:58:24.223]  The wild card that formerly was the wild card was Michael Bloomberg, but now he's just going to drop several billion dollars and purchase the election.
[01:58:24.283 --> 01:58:28.225]  So, I think previously the big discussion was big tech.
[01:58:28.285 --> 01:58:29.866]  Now I think he's just going to purchase the election.
[01:58:30.486 --> 01:58:32.827]  One component that we can do, I think, in order to... Let's back up.
[01:58:32.847 --> 01:58:34.368]  You think Bloomberg could actually do it?
[01:58:37.512 --> 01:58:39.934]  To win the election is going to be a long shot.
[01:58:40.014 --> 01:58:42.915]  I don't think he has the will to do it.
[01:58:43.075 --> 01:58:43.716]  Absolutely.
[01:58:44.376 --> 01:58:51.901]  So we're going to see, I mean, we're going to see whether or not the hypothesis of him pulling it off is going to come to fruition for Super Tuesday.
[01:58:52.441 --> 01:58:56.043]  But I mean, the amount of ads that he's been purchasing, I use this analogy.
[01:58:56.444 --> 01:59:05.309]  So if you're worth $100,000 and you drop the $5,600 maximum contribution to your preferred candidate, that would be the equivalent of Bloomberg
[01:59:05.889 --> 01:59:14.454]  According to, you know, relating it to his net worth, it would be the equivalent of him dropping $3.5 billion into his own campaign.
[01:59:14.994 --> 01:59:22.078]  That's more than, I believe, I could probably say, that's more than all presidential campaigns in the collective.
[01:59:22.178 --> 01:59:26.520]  So here's this Republican oligarch coming to the rescue of the Democrats.
[01:59:27.521 --> 01:59:29.482]  So look at the political constellation.
[01:59:30.122 --> 01:59:31.703]  What is the real reason he's doing it?
[01:59:33.755 --> 01:59:48.027]  The real reason is that back in November, before he announced, it was evident that the Democrats were going to impeach, and then Biden was going to, his name was going to be brought through the mud with his son Hunter taking that board seat with Bernie.
[01:59:48.107 --> 01:59:49.368]  Exactly.
[01:59:49.388 --> 01:59:49.868]  Don't say that.
[01:59:49.908 --> 01:59:53.792]  They want to remove Biden and put Bloomberg in the poll position.
[01:59:55.293 --> 01:59:55.853]  Absolutely.
[01:59:57.134 --> 01:59:58.255]  I agree with that assessment.
[01:59:58.375 --> 01:59:58.876]  Absolutely.
[01:59:59.566 --> 02:00:00.927]  Uh, he's on his way down.
[02:00:01.007 --> 02:00:02.128]  Obviously, we saw that.
[02:00:02.148 --> 02:00:05.191]  So we were wondering who the big mystery candidate is.
[02:00:05.211 --> 02:00:06.092]  It won't be Hillary.
[02:00:06.112 --> 02:00:07.413]  It's going to be Bloomberg.
[02:00:08.654 --> 02:00:11.957]  So here's the mystery candidate that a lot of people are maybe talking about.
[02:00:12.317 --> 02:00:15.400]  So if Bernie Sanders wins the nomination,
[02:00:16.227 --> 02:00:22.110]  I would say that Tulsi Gabbard is probably on the short list for VP pick for Bernie.
[02:00:22.190 --> 02:00:33.735]  And again, we're going back to 2016 with her endorsing him back in 2016, so I think that still carries some cachet, even though I think she made some missteps over the last few months.
[02:00:34.435 --> 02:00:38.137]  If it's Bloomberg, we have to take a look and see.
[02:00:38.177 --> 02:00:42.579]  The biggest indicator of my hypothesis being accurate is that
[02:00:43.288 --> 02:00:52.693]  If Hillary Clinton takes her residency and moves it from New York to Arkansas or elsewhere, that's going to be the biggest indicator that she's going to be the running mate with Bloomberg.
[02:00:53.613 --> 02:00:57.095]  Because if you look at Bloomberg's... You can't have two people from the same state.
[02:00:58.255 --> 02:00:58.535]  Correct.
[02:00:58.555 --> 02:00:58.955]  Explain that.
[02:00:58.995 --> 02:01:00.676]  You can't have two people from the same district.
[02:01:01.897 --> 02:01:02.077]  Right.
[02:01:02.117 --> 02:01:06.279]  According to the Constitution, I can't cite the exact same... You can't have two people from the same state.
[02:01:07.250 --> 02:01:08.991]  Same state, you cannot have that.
[02:01:09.051 --> 02:01:14.513]  So the President and the Vice President have to be representatives from, or residents, of two different states.
[02:01:14.533 --> 02:01:17.614]  So if she says Illinois or Arkansas, you know it's a done deal?
[02:01:18.895 --> 02:01:19.575]  It's a done deal.
[02:01:19.595 --> 02:01:21.916]  She's going to jump in the race immediately after the convention.
[02:01:22.116 --> 02:01:24.457]  Well, we've known all along she plans to do that.
[02:01:25.498 --> 02:01:28.539]  Whether she was going to do it or not, she keeps control of the party saying that.
[02:01:28.659 --> 02:01:30.280]  But it might actually happen.
[02:01:32.068 --> 02:01:32.289]  Right.
[02:01:32.749 --> 02:01:39.783]  And I think if that happens, that's a guarantee for Trump's victory, for re-election.
[02:01:40.515 --> 02:01:50.761]  Now Bloomberg by himself, maybe a stronger person, then I think it'd be a challenging race for Trump 2020, but I mean, I think they still pull it off with a victory.
[02:01:51.242 --> 02:01:55.544]  Money can't buy everything, and people don't like Bloomberg.
[02:01:56.125 --> 02:02:00.167]  I mean, I don't care if he's got $10 billion to spend, I just don't see people buying.
[02:02:00.507 --> 02:02:07.732]  And notice he can have all the memes he wants, nobody's censoring him, but the average mom tries to put a meme out, she's censored.
[02:02:09.264 --> 02:02:09.624]  Right, right.
[02:02:09.644 --> 02:02:12.046]  So, hey, he's a great capitalist.
[02:02:12.487 --> 02:02:13.848]  I don't take that away from him at all.
[02:02:15.069 --> 02:02:16.770]  But he has zero charisma.
[02:02:17.531 --> 02:02:19.693]  I just don't see him motivating people to come out.
[02:02:19.733 --> 02:02:25.658]  I mean, I guess you can motivate people so much with money, and if that's the only indicator, then he has a chance.
[02:02:25.698 --> 02:02:30.662]  But outside of that, he has no ability, I think, to motivate folks outside of his deep pockets.
[02:02:31.482 --> 02:02:33.104]  Let me ask you this as a citizen.
[02:02:34.651 --> 02:02:38.675]  You know, I really wanted to get into kind of General Flynn's case.
[02:02:38.735 --> 02:02:39.716]  Yeah, get into Flynn right now.
[02:02:39.736 --> 02:02:40.957]  That's why I was going next.
[02:02:41.758 --> 02:02:45.721]  That ties into, significantly, the 2020 campaign.
[02:02:46.262 --> 02:02:59.374]  Because when you take a 33-year veteran that's deployed for five years in his career, you know, a very highly decorated general that took a massive amount of risk to help and support our current president,
[02:02:59.984 --> 02:03:13.269]  In his election in 2016 and then the entire cabal, I mean I'm not going to rehash all these different names, goes after him to essentially remove his ability to clean house and now continues to prosecute him.
[02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:14.610]  That's a travesty.
[02:03:14.990 --> 02:03:23.273]  So I'm hoping that his case here shortly, the judge in his case, allows him to withdraw his guilty plea because by doing that
[02:03:24.207 --> 02:03:35.578]  They're going to be able to, Sidney Powell, an amazing attorney, is going to be able to call witnesses and do discovery to literally uncover the entire, you know, what everybody's been calling the conspiracy theories.
[02:03:35.858 --> 02:03:37.920]  Well, they're no longer going to be conspiracy theories.
[02:03:38.300 --> 02:03:41.023]  They're going to be actual conspiracies.
[02:03:41.747 --> 02:03:48.991]  That are uncovered to undermine and dethrone a duly elected president that, you know, we've been talking about it for three years.
[02:03:49.411 --> 02:03:53.634]  But the mainstream media and the American public has not really seen that.
[02:03:53.954 --> 02:04:04.900]  And I think the biggest violation of our rights occurred, and it was uncovered, I think it was about two weeks ago, when the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court
[02:04:06.249 --> 02:04:15.358]  Put out there publicly that two of the four FISA warrants that were issued by the court to the FBI to surveil the Trump campaign were done illegitimately, illegally.
[02:04:16.019 --> 02:04:18.441]  So that's going to start, that's going to continue to open things up.
[02:04:18.901 --> 02:04:24.287]  And I think General Flynn's case is instrumental on the outside of uncovering all this.
[02:04:24.467 --> 02:04:27.389]  And then John Durham is going to be uncovering all of these.
[02:04:28.135 --> 02:04:28.535]  No, I agree.
[02:04:28.555 --> 02:04:29.796]  I totally agree with you, Ivan.
[02:04:29.856 --> 02:04:32.138]  But my problem is, what is the Attorney General going to do?
[02:04:32.158 --> 02:04:34.919]  Because right at this critical point of victory, he's signaling an attack on Trump.
[02:04:34.939 --> 02:04:37.381]  So that's where I'm really worried, is that that's happening.
[02:04:55.060 --> 02:04:55.600]  He came out today.
[02:04:55.620 --> 02:04:58.321]  You may have missed it because he just came out in that last hour or two.
[02:04:58.801 --> 02:05:11.666]  I saw an indication that he just came out in the public that he appointed somebody internally to investigate those prosecutors that are prosecuting General Flynn to determine whether or not there's any sort of... No, I saw that.
[02:05:11.686 --> 02:05:14.347]  He created a new special office to do that.
[02:05:15.528 --> 02:05:15.768]  Yes.
[02:05:16.468 --> 02:05:17.128]  I just picked up on it.
[02:05:17.148 --> 02:05:18.969]  Maybe it was... I just picked up on it earlier.
[02:05:18.989 --> 02:05:19.249]  Here it is.
[02:05:19.289 --> 02:05:24.051]  Barr installs outside prosecutor to review case against Flynn ex-Trump advisor.
[02:05:27.563 --> 02:05:29.068]  Absolutely.
[02:05:29.268 --> 02:05:30.452]  I'm not an enemy with Barr.
[02:05:30.532 --> 02:05:33.321]  I'm not just trying to sit here and like attacking.
[02:05:33.883 --> 02:05:34.725]  All I know is...
[02:05:36.952 --> 02:05:39.073]  I had them try to set me up with the Russians.
[02:05:39.153 --> 02:05:40.934]  I had to go meet with the FBI.
[02:05:41.454 --> 02:05:49.478]  I'm not gonna talk about it on air, they asked me not to, but they literally had an FBI task force saying that my dad and I were Russian agents, okay?
[02:05:49.958 --> 02:05:55.281]  So, when you've been through that, when you have no connection, I mean, you're about as Russian as I get at Rainbow Ray in the U.S.
[02:05:55.341 --> 02:05:58.582]  Army, paid for everybody, you know, as about as Russian as I get.
[02:05:58.882 --> 02:06:03.925]  Like, when you're being accused of being a Russian agent, you've done nothing with Russia, you start getting a little bit pissed off.
[02:06:04.465 --> 02:06:05.045]  Does that make sense?
[02:06:05.446 --> 02:06:05.686]  Not.
[02:06:06.006 --> 02:06:07.347]  As well you should be, absolutely.
[02:06:07.387 --> 02:06:12.010]  So, I mean, this whole process brings discredit upon the entire organization.
[02:06:12.070 --> 02:06:23.117]  Unfortunately, I know folks in the FBI and the line agents doing their job, doing their job well, great risk to themselves to promote the security of the public.
[02:06:23.317 --> 02:06:24.578]  They go home to their families.
[02:06:24.618 --> 02:06:25.379]  No, I get it.
[02:06:25.399 --> 02:06:30.702]  You understand, at the end of the day, they literally were told, I'm a Russian agent with no proof.
[02:06:30.862 --> 02:06:31.543]  I'm pissed, man.
[02:06:33.112 --> 02:06:34.213]  I want retribution.
[02:06:34.574 --> 02:06:38.939]  I didn't sell out to the Spanish, or the Russians, or the Germans, or the Japanese.
[02:06:39.619 --> 02:06:40.460]  That's what pisses me off.
[02:06:40.580 --> 02:06:41.501]  I'm called a traitor.
[02:06:41.822 --> 02:06:42.843]  They never get in trouble.
[02:06:43.003 --> 02:06:44.184]  They need to get in trouble for this.
[02:06:45.746 --> 02:06:48.810]  Absolutely, and I think Barr is on our side 100%.
[02:06:49.530 --> 02:06:54.436]  Even though what he said on that interview, I think it's essentially signaling to the President that, hey,
[02:06:55.220 --> 02:06:55.980]  I've got this.
[02:06:56.500 --> 02:06:57.320]  Just let me do it.
[02:06:57.340 --> 02:07:06.642]  It's not maybe going as quickly as you want it to go, but I've got this and it's moving forward nicely because there's a lot of, you know, the bureaucracy moves slowly.
[02:07:07.142 --> 02:07:12.643]  So I think my assessment was as far indicated that we've got a handle on this.
[02:07:12.663 --> 02:07:13.603]  Just let me do my job.
[02:07:14.203 --> 02:07:14.603]  All right.
[02:07:14.683 --> 02:07:15.664]  Well, I hope you're right.
[02:07:15.764 --> 02:07:16.624]  You probably are.
[02:07:17.284 --> 02:07:18.924]  Ivan Reikland, thank you so much.
[02:07:18.964 --> 02:07:20.124]  Reikland at Twitter.
[02:07:20.544 --> 02:07:21.324]  Come back and join us again.
[02:07:21.344 --> 02:07:21.965]  It's been hard to get you on.
[02:07:22.005 --> 02:07:23.285]  I've been trying to get you on for a couple of years.
[02:07:23.325 --> 02:07:24.145]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:07:25.393 --> 02:07:28.255]  No, we'll do it a lot sooner than two years, Alex.
[02:07:28.735 --> 02:07:29.256]  All right, brother.
[02:07:29.636 --> 02:07:32.658]  We'll be right back with Roger Stone's lawyer, 4th Hour, straight ahead.
[02:07:32.678 --> 02:07:33.018]  Stay with us.
[02:07:47.307 --> 02:07:48.107]  D.O.J.
[02:07:48.227 --> 02:07:50.188]  Andrew McCabe will not face criminal charges.
[02:07:50.688 --> 02:07:53.609]  Giant billboard in London encourages women to cheat on their husbands.
[02:07:54.569 --> 02:07:54.870]  God.
[02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:57.090]  It's like aliens are trying to hack the planet.
[02:07:57.711 --> 02:07:59.851]  Auto industry plunges deeper into recession.
[02:08:01.632 --> 02:08:04.173]  Syrian military helicopter shot down near Aleppo.
[02:08:04.213 --> 02:08:04.833]  Crew killed.
[02:08:04.913 --> 02:08:05.573]  Video of that.
[02:08:05.733 --> 02:08:06.754]  Infowars.com.
[02:08:07.254 --> 02:08:08.354]  Video Leavitt's attack.
[02:08:08.454 --> 02:08:10.035]  College Republicans spit on U.S.
[02:08:10.075 --> 02:08:10.475]  flag.
[02:08:11.755 --> 02:08:12.135]  Jesus.
[02:08:12.456 --> 02:08:16.777]  It's just like, they have the right to do that, but like, why do you want to be here if you're doing that?
[02:08:23.186 --> 02:08:33.014]  Let's go back to our former Green Beret, and of course, former Defense Intelligence Agency lawyer, Ivan Reikland.
[02:08:33.434 --> 02:08:39.339]  Ivan, in closing here, ahead of Roger Stone's lawyer joining us, who's always late with a Skype playing with it, which is okay.
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:45.864]  What would you call, I asked this when you first came on over an hour ago, what is this period in history we're in right now?
[02:08:48.763 --> 02:08:49.443]  Period in history?
[02:08:49.483 --> 02:08:52.364]  I mean, I use the term ridiculous for a whole slew of reasons.
[02:08:52.424 --> 02:08:57.046]  We talked about big tech going after election fraud.
[02:08:57.066 --> 02:08:58.546]  We talked about all these cases.
[02:08:58.606 --> 02:09:03.788]  McCabe having one standard of when he lies to the FBI himself, he doesn't get prosecuted.
[02:09:04.128 --> 02:09:09.530]  When somebody doesn't lie to the FBI that you have a political vendetta with, you prosecute them for seven to nine years.
[02:09:10.716 --> 02:09:12.337]  Uh, there's a whole laundry list.
[02:09:12.597 --> 02:09:17.740]  Oh, even in closing, yesterday I was at the Pro-Life Rally in Richmond, Virginia.
[02:09:17.780 --> 02:09:19.621]  You were there a few weeks ago for the gun rally.
[02:09:19.641 --> 02:09:20.382]  Same location.
[02:09:20.922 --> 02:09:25.385]  And guess, uh, I mean, we had several thousand people there.
[02:09:25.405 --> 02:09:26.785]  And guess who wasn't there?
[02:09:26.805 --> 02:09:29.087]  The governor.
[02:09:29.787 --> 02:09:32.729]  He's not my governor, but he's the governor of the Commonwealth of Virginia.
[02:09:32.849 --> 02:09:34.210]  But he's keeping babies comfortable.
[02:09:35.908 --> 02:09:37.828]  Oh yeah, he's making the babies comfortable.
[02:09:37.868 --> 02:09:38.289]  You know what?
[02:09:38.469 --> 02:09:39.769]  I call for his mother.
[02:09:40.109 --> 02:09:44.710]  I'm not sure if she's alive, but she should consider a post-birth abortion on her son.
[02:09:45.470 --> 02:09:46.070]  Exactly.
[02:09:46.430 --> 02:09:47.450]  Legally, you're a lawyer.
[02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:55.352]  If you're going to kill somebody a month after they're born, I'm not saying kill the governor, but his mother could walk right up and just ice pick him in the neck because it's a post-birth abortion.
[02:09:55.772 --> 02:10:05.494]  Consult with the physician, and if she wants, she can consult with two physicians, and then make a decision, make sure that Governor Northam's comfortable, and then go ahead and abort him.
[02:10:07.125 --> 02:10:08.446]  Because he's acting like an infant.
[02:10:08.546 --> 02:10:09.446]  I guess you'd call it an infanticide.
[02:10:09.466 --> 02:10:10.987]  I'm not using it for abortion, but I would like to see an abortion.
[02:10:11.007 --> 02:10:17.530]  That may be one case where it's actually, you know, the women's right supersedes Governor Northam's rights.
[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:20.420]  That's a good point.
[02:10:20.780 --> 02:10:22.221]  They want to get the baby's organs.
[02:10:22.261 --> 02:10:23.842]  They want to say we can keep him alive after.
[02:10:24.182 --> 02:10:28.863]  But exactly, if it's a week after, a month after, 55 years after, that's a good point.
[02:10:28.923 --> 02:10:30.404]  I mean, what is Northam going to do?
[02:10:30.464 --> 02:10:35.586]  God forbid somebody walks right up to him and says, post-birth abortion, and just stabs him in the neck.
[02:10:35.666 --> 02:10:37.046]  I mean, what is he going to do?
[02:10:37.066 --> 02:10:39.927]  Like, somebody just walks up and says, you know, Governor Northam, you're right.
[02:10:40.347 --> 02:10:40.967]  I've decided.
[02:10:41.027 --> 02:10:42.788]  It's more limited than that, Alex.
[02:10:43.368 --> 02:10:48.130]  I argue it's more limited where the mother is the only one that can give that authorization.
[02:10:48.690 --> 02:10:48.950]  Right?
[02:10:49.410 --> 02:10:54.853]  Using his logic, it would be his mother that would be the only one that has the rights to post-birth abortion.
[02:10:59.515 --> 02:11:01.295]  I mean, that's, I'm using his argument.
[02:11:01.335 --> 02:11:01.796]  What do you think?
[02:11:02.976 --> 02:11:04.157]  No, I mean, I think you're right.
[02:11:04.477 --> 02:11:08.238]  I just, he wants to kill babies all day and I don't wish any harm upon him.
[02:11:08.258 --> 02:11:09.539]  I just wonder what's going to happen.
[02:11:09.559 --> 02:11:09.979]  Isn't it interesting?
[02:11:11.005 --> 02:11:36.631]  Isn't it interesting, that interview comes out and I believe the following day, it's almost as though that Black Parenthood put out a hit squad for oppo research on Governor Northam to find blackface so that the entire media industrial complex diverted their attention from him making the statements of making the babies feel comfortable so that they could be executed after birth and then it transitions into blackface.
[02:11:36.751 --> 02:11:38.531]  Exactly, they pivoted to the racist thing.
[02:11:39.167 --> 02:11:41.349]  He was the guy with the KK outfit.
[02:11:41.769 --> 02:11:42.450]  No, you're right.
[02:11:42.650 --> 02:11:44.731]  They pivoted to the racism.
[02:11:45.292 --> 02:11:46.753]  Ivan Reikland, thank you so much.
[02:11:46.773 --> 02:11:48.074]  Reikland on Twitter.
[02:11:48.594 --> 02:11:49.275]  Amazing, brother.
[02:11:49.315 --> 02:11:50.236]  Appreciate you, man.
[02:11:51.076 --> 02:11:51.497]  I love it.
[02:11:51.537 --> 02:11:53.618]  Thanks for having me on, Alex.
[02:11:53.998 --> 02:11:54.719]  Thanks for coming on with us.
[02:11:54.739 --> 02:11:55.780]  Be happy to come on any time.
[02:11:56.180 --> 02:11:57.241]  Come on every week with us.
[02:11:57.261 --> 02:11:57.721]  We love you.
[02:11:57.901 --> 02:12:02.245]  Alright, we're going to come right back from break and hopefully we have Roger Stone's lawyer, Tyler Nixon.
[02:12:04.059 --> 02:12:06.480]  To talk about what in hell is going on here.
[02:12:06.500 --> 02:12:11.841]  I mean, I can tell you that obviously he's being threatened not to come on the show and there's... This is the big story.
[02:12:11.901 --> 02:12:16.083]  The next big move against the President is... Why are you pardoning people?
[02:12:16.143 --> 02:12:17.063]  You don't have that power.
[02:12:17.423 --> 02:12:18.884]  It's only in the Constitution.
[02:12:20.864 --> 02:12:24.065]  You've got to admire people that are true to their cause.
[02:12:24.865 --> 02:12:25.806]  Ilhan Omar.
[02:12:28.947 --> 02:12:29.907]  Tlaib and others.
[02:12:31.235 --> 02:12:46.608]  I mean, they really came to America from their squalid third world hellholes where women had no power as assassins of Stockholm Syndrome to conquer us because of our open hearts.
[02:12:48.081 --> 02:12:59.125]  And when you saw them at the State of the Union last week stand down during a celebration of the life of 100-year-old World War II heroes, it illustrated who they were.
[02:12:59.725 --> 02:13:07.948]  Horrible pigs who could never be redeemed because they have chips on their dirty shoulders.
[02:13:08.968 --> 02:13:11.569]  Here's the report that they hope you don't spread.
[02:13:12.930 --> 02:13:27.981]  As President Trump continues to battle the globalist forces of the deep state, the Democrat Party continues to take off its mask and reveal themselves as the true enemy of America and its people.
[02:13:28.401 --> 02:13:37.968]  Last week, Trump delivered a historic State of the Union address, which included an emotional tribute to honor one of the last remaining heroes
[02:13:38.428 --> 02:13:40.249]  But wait a minute.
[02:13:40.570 --> 02:13:44.052]  Who the hell is that sitting on their asses during the tribute?
[02:13:44.492 --> 02:13:45.173]  You guessed it.
[02:13:45.533 --> 02:13:46.774]  The enemy within.
[02:13:47.094 --> 02:13:52.177]  That's radical leftist Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib caught on camera.
[02:13:52.357 --> 02:14:08.088]  Seen here refusing to stand up and honor Charles McGee of the legendary Tuskegee Airmen, a unit of black fighter and bomber pilots who distinguished themselves during fierce aerial combat missions in World War II.
[02:14:08.708 --> 02:14:21.359]  After more than 130 combat missions in World War II, he came back home to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve America in Korea and Vietnam.
[02:14:21.779 --> 02:14:26.623]  On December 7th, Charles celebrated his 100th birthday.
[02:14:28.189 --> 02:14:36.916]  As Republicans and Democrats rose to applaud this all-American hero, Omar and Tlaib just couldn't bring themselves to do so.
[02:14:37.437 --> 02:14:46.364]  In fact, they ended up walking out of the speech early in defiance of what Rashida Tlaib said was Trump's lies and bigotry.
[02:14:46.764 --> 02:14:49.045]  But hey, this shouldn't really surprise anyone.
[02:14:49.346 --> 02:14:59.172]  After all, these are among the same radical leftists who refused to condemn Antifa after their terrorist attack on an ICE facility in Tacoma, Washington.
[02:14:59.352 --> 02:15:05.415]  We are learning new details about the man who threw explosive devices at an immigration detention center in Tacoma, Washington.
[02:15:05.435 --> 02:15:14.641]  Police are saying that a man was armed with a rifle and firebombs and attacked the private facility operated on behalf of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE.
[02:15:14.821 --> 02:15:21.065]  Villain Von Spronson, who was linked with the Antifa domestic terror movement, attacked an ICE facility in Tacoma.
[02:15:21.545 --> 02:15:23.587]  He was carrying an AR-15 and firebombs.
[02:15:23.787 --> 02:15:27.169]  He torched several cars that apparently hoped to burn the facility to the ground.
[02:15:27.649 --> 02:15:29.170]  He was shot dead before he could kill anyone.
[02:15:29.470 --> 02:15:32.332]  Will you condemn the Antifa attack in Washington over the weekend?
[02:15:34.353 --> 02:15:35.434]  It's easy to condemn terrorism.
[02:15:35.474 --> 02:15:35.954]  Will you condemn it?
[02:15:36.935 --> 02:15:40.157]  Antifa firebombed a facility in Tacoma over the weekend.
[02:15:40.217 --> 02:15:41.118]  It's an ICE facility.
[02:15:41.658 --> 02:15:42.939]  Will you condemn them for that?
[02:15:44.284 --> 02:15:44.824]  Are you pleased?
[02:15:46.525 --> 02:15:47.426]  Should more people do it?
[02:15:49.387 --> 02:15:50.308]  It's easy to say no.
[02:15:51.068 --> 02:15:55.571]  Look, we know who these people are and we know their agenda.
[02:15:55.671 --> 02:15:57.492]  We're gonna go in there, we're gonna impeach the mother******.
[02:15:57.812 --> 02:16:02.455]  But Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib are not really traitors to America.
[02:16:03.316 --> 02:16:08.739]  To me, if you really think about it, they're more like infiltrators.
[02:16:13.905 --> 02:16:20.387]  Alright, we've got Roger Stone's lawyer, despite all the attempts at censorship, about to join us next segment.
[02:16:20.787 --> 02:16:22.508]  We're getting him on video Skype right now.
[02:16:23.568 --> 02:16:26.489]  So, that's coming up at the start of the next segment.
[02:16:27.389 --> 02:16:35.532]  But this Jesse Smollett, indicted in the age of fake hate crimes, we're going to air this special report.
[02:16:36.392 --> 02:16:38.795]  Right now because it's so incredibly important.
[02:16:38.815 --> 02:16:45.322]  Just please remember as viewers and listeners, this infrastructure and what we've built and what we've done, no one else has this.
[02:16:45.823 --> 02:16:48.345]  And I don't say that from a position of like, aren't we amazing?
[02:16:48.365 --> 02:16:49.407]  It's actually scary.
[02:16:50.464 --> 02:16:55.947]  That when it comes to folks fighting the globalists at point-blank range and having victory, we're as good as it gets.
[02:16:56.668 --> 02:16:57.709]  That scares the hell out of me.
[02:16:58.129 --> 02:17:06.654]  So please share the video feeds, please share the articles, please spread the reports, and please buy the products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:17:08.601 --> 02:17:13.266]  Nanosilver products, affordable food, the books, the films, the t-shirts, you all need it.
[02:17:13.866 --> 02:17:17.770]  And your purchase of it all makes what we do here possible.
[02:17:18.511 --> 02:17:24.697]  So here is that report we were just mentioning on Smollier and the rest of it.
[02:17:24.717 --> 02:17:25.317]  We'll be right back.
[02:17:25.337 --> 02:17:25.698]  Stay with us.
[02:17:26.598 --> 02:17:42.608]  Just over one year has passed since we first heard the chilling story of the racist and homophobic MAGA attack on Jussie Smollett, a name we all became familiar with after the former Empire actor came out in January of 2019 and announced to the world that Trump supporters were responsible for this egregious crime.
[02:17:43.388 --> 02:17:49.894]  But as investigators looked deeper into his story, many things didn't seem to line up and Smollett was charged with 16 counts of disorderly conduct.
[02:17:50.434 --> 02:17:56.159]  Then his charges were magically dropped by an Obama-linked prosecutor working on the case, and the story all but disappeared by the end of 2019.
[02:17:57.762 --> 02:18:07.772]  However, Smollett is now back in the headlines after being indicted again by a grand jury on six counts of disorderly conduct for allegedly lying to police about the attack and filing false police reports.
[02:18:08.332 --> 02:18:09.393]  But let's backtrack a little.
[02:18:09.914 --> 02:18:15.639]  I mean, it's been over a year since Smollett came forward with this story and many may have forgotten all of the little details tied to the case.
[02:18:16.340 --> 02:18:33.788]  Such is how he was attacked on a snowy Chicago night at 2am after leaving Subway when two white males in Make America Great Again hats jumped out of the shadows and beat him senseless, pouring bleach on him while yelling racist and homophobic slurs, wrapping a noose around his neck and taking off, but not before yelling, this is MAGA country.
[02:18:34.528 --> 02:18:40.171]  I have actually acquired video footage from the night of the event, but just a warning folks, viewer discretion is advised.
[02:18:40.931 --> 02:18:42.633]  Yes, I am.
[02:18:43.153 --> 02:18:44.214]  I'm the Gang Tupac.
[02:18:44.234 --> 02:18:44.614]  What's good?
[02:18:45.195 --> 02:18:45.956]  What's good?
[02:18:45.996 --> 02:18:48.458]  Get more aggressive, more aggressive.
[02:18:48.498 --> 02:18:50.520]  Let me fight back a little bit.
[02:18:50.700 --> 02:18:52.121]  Let me fight back.
[02:18:56.885 --> 02:19:04.252]  All jokes aside, these long-awaited indictments come after a year-long investigation which exposed Smollett's various lies.
[02:19:14.080 --> 02:19:14.580]  We're good to go!
[02:19:42.423 --> 02:19:53.806]  Of course, celebrities and politicians didn't waste a second before coming out in support of Smollett and rebuking racism, Trump supporters, and Trump's America for not only enabling but encouraging this type of behavior.
[02:19:54.406 --> 02:19:56.027]  But Smollett's case isn't unique.
[02:19:56.527 --> 02:20:06.730]  After President Trump took office, there has been a rise in fake hate crimes targeted at pushing the idea that white supremacy, racism, and homophobic attacks are commonplace to Trump supporters.
[02:20:07.310 --> 02:20:17.941]  For example, back in November of 2016, a church organist spray-painted a swastika, an anti-gay slur, and the words, Hail Trump, on an LGBTQ church he attended.
[02:20:18.522 --> 02:20:23.167]  And when the story first broke, several mainstream media outlets tied the hate hoax to Trump's election.
[02:20:23.727 --> 02:20:28.473]  He was later arrested after it was found out that he was the very one behind the crime he had reported.
[02:20:29.562 --> 02:20:40.648]  Also during that month, an 18-year-old Muslim woman in Louisiana claimed that two white men, one of whom was wearing a MAGA hat, attacked and robbed her, taking her wallet and hijab while yelling racial slurs.
[02:20:41.288 --> 02:20:44.830]  She later admitted to the police that she made the whole thing up.
[02:20:44.910 --> 02:20:51.533]  In 2018, a 19-year-old African American woman in Long Island said that a group of four teenagers approached her yelling Trump 2016.
[02:20:53.234 --> 02:20:58.975]  They then told her she didn't belong in the country, slashed her tires, and placed a note on her car that said, go home.
[02:20:59.595 --> 02:21:05.116]  However, after an investigation done by police, it was learned that none of this ever actually took place.
[02:21:05.996 --> 02:21:10.637]  These are a few of a long list of fake hate crimes, with Smollett's being one of the most prominent.
[02:21:11.097 --> 02:21:21.779]  He's due in court on February 24th, where many are waiting to see if justice will finally be served, and if Trump supporters will finally be vindicated for the blame of yet another staged hate crime.
[02:21:22.339 --> 02:21:34.648]  To fight back against these fake hate crimes perpetuated by the fake media and lying politicians, go to Infowarsstore.com where you can help promote the fight for truth by buying our great products, t-shirts, and storable foods.

[02:21:42.073 --> 02:21:44.094]  This has been Savannah Hernandez for Action 7 News.
[02:21:47.734 --> 02:21:53.138]  Well, Tyler Nixon, Roger Stone's private lawyer and confidant with us.
[02:21:53.178 --> 02:21:55.400]  He's not a lawyer on the criminal case.
[02:21:56.320 --> 02:22:03.746]  And he joins us, despite a lot of roadblocks, right now live on this Friday, Valentine's Day transmission.
[02:22:04.486 --> 02:22:06.548]  So, Tyler, we appreciate you coming on.
[02:22:06.568 --> 02:22:14.354]  We appreciate your courage as a patriot and Army veteran for telling the truth and all you've gone through to defend Roger.
[02:22:15.547 --> 02:22:16.688]  So much is happening.
[02:22:16.708 --> 02:22:18.190]  I could ask a lot of questions.
[02:22:18.470 --> 02:22:23.355]  I think the best thing to do is just give you the floor about the big national controversy.
[02:22:23.395 --> 02:22:26.939]  We kept asking, what will the next attack on the president be?
[02:22:27.019 --> 02:22:28.820]  Well, it's the pardon of Roger Stone.
[02:22:29.301 --> 02:22:33.365]  He's not supposed to have that power, even though it's in the Constitution, plain as day.
[02:22:34.846 --> 02:22:38.608]  So, the fiascos just continue.
[02:22:38.648 --> 02:22:47.473]  So, Tyler, without getting yourself in too much trouble or getting into what's happening with Roger, just as a citizen, as a veteran, as a patriot, what is happening right now?
[02:22:48.614 --> 02:23:00.400]  Well, I mean, you just look at the two-tiered justice system we have with Andrew McCabe, this lying criminal who was entrusted with such vast power, Deputy Director of the FBI.
[02:23:01.144 --> 02:23:02.284]  Just totally let off.
[02:23:02.564 --> 02:23:10.566]  He openly admitted that he lied to his fellow FBI agents to cover up the leaking that was going on, the seditious activities within the FBI.
[02:23:10.886 --> 02:23:11.387]  He's let go.
[02:23:11.487 --> 02:23:16.768]  Roger Stone is treated like some sort of, you know, kingpin drug criminal or whatever have you.
[02:23:17.848 --> 02:23:25.110]  This is, they just, the left, the screeching, squealing, rapacious left just can never stop short
[02:23:25.888 --> 02:23:27.729]  of going too far in any instance.
[02:23:27.769 --> 02:23:35.591]  They just don't know when to quit, they don't know when to pull back, and they don't know when they've gone too far, because they're just greedy, manic, out of control.
[02:23:36.372 --> 02:23:40.233]  Their thirst, their greed, their lust for power is endless.
[02:23:40.253 --> 02:23:50.957]  I totally agree, but for new listeners and viewers tuning in every second, tell them, McCabe, a letter came out today of Valentine's present, saying you're not in trouble for all the things you did, so talk about that.
[02:23:52.273 --> 02:23:52.693]  Well, sure.
[02:23:52.713 --> 02:24:00.575]  I mean, you had the federal prosecutors after sitting on it for something like, I don't know, it's been at least a year since McCabe was fired.
[02:24:01.155 --> 02:24:03.276]  And basically, I think probably more than that.
[02:24:03.856 --> 02:24:10.817]  And they were taking all this time to go over, I don't know what there was to go over, but they were, because he admitted it, he admitted that he lied.
[02:24:12.658 --> 02:24:16.479]  He lied to Congress, he lied to the President, he leaked.
[02:24:16.499 --> 02:24:17.979]  I mean, this guy is incredible.
[02:24:18.786 --> 02:24:32.879]  Yeah, well, basically it came out of a Wall Street Journal story that talked about, like, it was basically he leaked to the media and they, Inspector General and others, you know, wanted to find out what is the source of these leaks because, you know, they had Comey the leaker.
[02:24:32.919 --> 02:24:34.921]  I mean, you know, these guys, they're great.
[02:24:34.961 --> 02:24:36.142]  They're great at playing this game.
[02:24:36.202 --> 02:24:39.645]  I mean, Schiff being the ringmaster of all in Washington on that front.
[02:24:40.486 --> 02:24:41.647]  But, you know, basically they were
[02:24:43.379 --> 02:24:53.283]  Looking into these stories that had gotten out and, you know, were basically favorable to, I guess, the Clintons and the Clinton Foundation and during the election.
[02:24:53.303 --> 02:24:58.906]  Sure, the January 15 human trafficking blackmail ring, which the Justice Department just prostates themselves to.
[02:25:00.339 --> 02:25:15.568]  Yeah, and so basically McCabe had told his own FBI agents, his own fellow agents under him, that he had not allowed the FBI to speak to anyone about the conduct of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and so forth.
[02:25:16.168 --> 02:25:17.468]  And so he lied.
[02:25:17.528 --> 02:25:18.089]  He was lying.
[02:25:18.169 --> 02:25:20.749]  He had basically been doing the leaking.
[02:25:20.809 --> 02:25:23.550]  He had been, you know, he had known about what was going on.
[02:25:23.570 --> 02:25:26.271]  I think Comey had briefed him and it's put this way.
[02:25:26.291 --> 02:25:30.232]  I mean, it just comes down to their little power cabal at the top thought they could get away with this stuff.
[02:25:30.492 --> 02:25:30.992]  And guess what?
[02:25:31.052 --> 02:25:31.672]  They have now.
[02:25:31.732 --> 02:25:34.993]  They have gotten away with it because he's let off scot-free.
[02:25:35.233 --> 02:25:39.154]  I mean, the most disgusting thing I've seen, I think, in recent memory was Andrew McCabe
[02:25:39.614 --> 02:25:46.439]  Denouncing the possibility of Roger Stone receiving any clemency and blasting the president for even coming out.
[02:25:46.479 --> 02:25:46.759]  It's insane!
[02:25:46.799 --> 02:25:48.220]  They should all be in prison, exactly.
[02:25:48.260 --> 02:25:53.784]  No, it's like some kind of cult in which they have to be brazen about their crimes and their dirty deeds.
[02:25:53.824 --> 02:25:55.005]  So what do you make of Barr?
[02:25:55.025 --> 02:25:57.587]  Because I had a guest on earlier saying Barr is sold out.
[02:25:57.967 --> 02:26:00.208]  But then, I want to be fair, I don't know the truth.
[02:26:01.149 --> 02:26:01.789]  I'm not God.
[02:26:01.809 --> 02:26:04.331]  You're saying no, this is a little bit more sophisticated.
[02:26:04.351 --> 02:26:05.312]  What do you think about Bill Barr?
[02:26:05.939 --> 02:26:08.002]  I'm on the fence with that, Roger.
[02:26:08.082 --> 02:26:12.568]  It's tough because I think he's, well, it comes down to, I guess, I should believe my lying eyes.
[02:26:13.370 --> 02:26:14.431]  He says the right things.
[02:26:14.611 --> 02:26:18.557]  He gave a speech at the Federalist Society Annual Lawyers Convention, which was
[02:26:19.531 --> 02:26:20.391]  Which was outstanding.
[02:26:20.431 --> 02:26:31.456]  He talked about, he put his finger on exactly what they're doing, which is this resistance campaign trying to thwart the proper operations of the United States government and the presidency, and yet nothing happens.
[02:26:31.496 --> 02:26:43.600]  I mean, these guys, I hate to say it, it's like the, as an attorney, I'm not, I'm not, I don't consider myself part of it, but you get into the legal realm of things, you get into like investigators, FBI agents, and attorneys, and the Justice Department, and the larger bar.
[02:26:43.620 --> 02:26:44.341]  It all becomes gray.
[02:26:44.361 --> 02:26:47.402]  Yeah, well it becomes, not it becomes gray, it becomes like a cabal of most of
[02:26:48.035 --> 02:26:49.837]  Well, we don't go after our own kind of thing.
[02:26:50.457 --> 02:26:52.219]  You know, it's like this self-protective thing.
[02:26:52.379 --> 02:27:04.951]  I mean, one of the things that the disciplinary system, and this is probably little known to most people, the disciplinary system throughout the country, it's state and there's no real federal level, but it's not designed in any way to punish.
[02:27:05.011 --> 02:27:11.417]  It says straight up, we don't take action against attorneys who've committed crimes or done anything to punish them in any way whatsoever.
[02:27:11.798 --> 02:27:13.199]  It's to protect the sanctity
[02:27:13.715 --> 02:27:14.836]  Of course.
[02:27:31.348 --> 02:27:32.749]  Yeah, the lid's blown off everything.
[02:27:33.069 --> 02:27:45.234]  It's a joke to think that they can let someone like an Andrew McCabe go, who everybody knows, and he admitted it, that he had misled and lied to his fellow FBI agents, which is a federal felony.
[02:27:45.274 --> 02:27:46.615]  I mean, give me a break, Roger Stone.
[02:27:46.635 --> 02:27:49.036]  Let's go back to this Taylor Nixon lawyer, Roger Stone's lawyer.
[02:27:49.856 --> 02:27:51.177]  What does it mean right now?
[02:27:52.327 --> 02:27:55.131]  Well, you know, I tend to think the fact that Trump didn't blast back at him
[02:28:11.502 --> 02:28:34.191]  Tells me that there might have been a little bit of a kabuki dance going on there, that it might have been a setup in a sense, and they sort of rope-a-doped the people who were talking about impeaching Barr, and then, you know, Trump goes into, you know, who's already been impeached and exonerated, goes into sort of his, you know, Twitter rant mode and draws attention away from Barr, who then looks like a... Okay, maybe that's right.
[02:28:34.211 --> 02:28:35.172]  Why is Barr covering up Epstein?
[02:28:36.616 --> 02:28:37.636]  You know, that's a good question.
[02:28:37.656 --> 02:28:42.357]  I mean, I think the problem is you're dealing with messes that go deeper than even Barr's tenure there.
[02:28:42.397 --> 02:28:43.438]  No, I mean, believe me, I get it.
[02:28:43.478 --> 02:28:45.418]  It's like, it's a huge blackmail ring.
[02:28:45.878 --> 02:28:47.759]  How do you unwind something like that?
[02:28:49.499 --> 02:28:51.259]  I mean, again, it runs so deep.
[02:28:51.299 --> 02:28:52.400]  It's a good question.
[02:28:52.440 --> 02:28:54.360]  And the problem is, you know, Bill Barr sits at the top.
[02:28:54.380 --> 02:28:56.581]  He's responsible for every prosecution in the country.
[02:28:57.241 --> 02:28:58.381]  And so does any attorney general.
[02:28:59.061 --> 02:29:02.582]  And, you know, I suppose if he really wanted to bore into it, he could.
[02:29:03.513 --> 02:29:08.578]  But, you know, some attorneys generals just say, look, you know, I'm not going to get involved in the weeds and into the lower level stuff.
[02:29:08.618 --> 02:29:09.378]  I mean, yeah, he was.
[02:29:09.398 --> 02:29:11.661]  I can tell you the Pentagon's pissed at Barr.
[02:29:12.361 --> 02:29:15.144]  And these lawyers think all day, like they're the only ones that exist.
[02:29:15.224 --> 02:29:20.829]  And I don't, I don't worship the Pentagon, but I mean, they're the ones that actually do the deeds.
[02:29:21.309 --> 02:29:25.173]  The Pentagon is like almost done right now because they've seen this.
[02:29:25.754 --> 02:29:27.275]  And if Trump's weak, that's fine.
[02:29:27.315 --> 02:29:29.137]  They're going to fill in for the president.
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:34.742]  So I just hope all these lawyers realize that they're really, they're at the end of their rubs right now.
[02:29:34.762 --> 02:29:36.283]  They're just like right at the end of their rubs.
[02:29:37.123 --> 02:29:37.303]  Yeah.
[02:29:37.463 --> 02:29:40.404]  I'll tell you what, you know, it's unfortunate because you're an army officer yourself.
[02:29:40.424 --> 02:29:41.685]  I mean, you know, the Pentagon's pissed.
[02:29:42.725 --> 02:29:43.406]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:29:43.446 --> 02:29:48.868]  And here's the thing is, you know, I thought of Roger Stone with him.
[02:29:49.406 --> 02:29:49.486]  It's
[02:30:08.997 --> 02:30:12.018]  Roger gave good advice and he's been punished for that.
[02:30:12.138 --> 02:30:12.699]  Stay there.
[02:30:13.139 --> 02:30:17.040]  Two more segments with Roger Stone's lawyer, Tyler Nixon, straight ahead.
[02:30:17.460 --> 02:30:18.881]  This is important stuff, folks.
[02:30:18.901 --> 02:30:20.082]  They hope no one hears this.
[02:30:20.502 --> 02:30:21.562]  Only way it gets out is you.
[02:30:22.683 --> 02:30:27.404]  Okay, well, Tyler Nixon last minute decided to disconnect and try to get a video feed to us.
[02:30:27.765 --> 02:30:29.925]  We have his audio, that's all that matters, but whatever.
[02:30:30.666 --> 02:30:32.907]  We didn't cut him off while he's doing whatever he's doing.
[02:30:32.927 --> 02:30:35.608]  It may take two days, three weeks, a hundred years, who knows.
[02:30:36.819 --> 02:30:38.620]  It's like karmically, this is just what happens.
[02:30:39.300 --> 02:30:41.020]  But hey, it's high technology, you know?
[02:30:41.201 --> 02:30:46.482]  Skype in, video up on satellites, on TV stations all over the country, it's amazing.
[02:30:47.843 --> 02:30:59.427]  All I know is, is the attack on President Trump and the attack on Roger Stone is an attack on us all, and that we need a repudiation of what has happened to Roger Stone.
[02:30:59.847 --> 02:31:01.067]  Not for Roger Stone!
[02:31:01.627 --> 02:31:03.588]  Even though I'm friends with Roger, he's an innocent man.
[02:31:04.895 --> 02:31:08.157]  The President needs to say, forget all this Russia crap!
[02:31:08.457 --> 02:31:10.699]  You people didn't deliver any evidence!
[02:31:11.840 --> 02:31:13.441]  And we're going to pardon everybody.
[02:31:14.942 --> 02:31:16.903]  Because let me tell you, I'm not a wimp.
[02:31:16.923 --> 02:31:19.285]  And I'm not a grandstander.
[02:31:19.665 --> 02:31:31.173]  But man, when you're watching Senate Intelligence Committees and House Armed Services Committees, and there's generals up there, and senators, they're calling you a Russian agent, I mean, you're like,
[02:31:35.583 --> 02:31:36.544]  I mean, you get pissed.
[02:31:40.246 --> 02:31:43.228]  I mean, we had a Russian on that's a Green Beret, U.S.
[02:31:43.268 --> 02:31:44.369]  patriot born in the U.S.
[02:31:44.429 --> 02:31:44.729]  earlier.
[02:31:44.989 --> 02:31:56.116]  That's as close to Russians, nothing against Russians, but it's like when you're accused of things that are 100% not true, it doesn't make you cower in fear.
[02:31:56.357 --> 02:31:58.298]  It pisses you off.
[02:31:59.648 --> 02:32:06.171]  Especially when the people doing it are globalists that say no borders, no wall, no USA at all.
[02:32:06.491 --> 02:32:07.592]  America sucks.
[02:32:07.952 --> 02:32:09.292]  They're creating racism.
[02:32:09.312 --> 02:32:10.433]  They're creating division.
[02:32:10.733 --> 02:32:16.596]  They walk out when the Tuskegee Airmen, a hero of World War II, a hundred-year-old black man.
[02:32:16.976 --> 02:32:18.477]  Those guys kicked ass in World War II.
[02:32:19.377 --> 02:32:27.581]  They walk out during the Tuskegee Airmen, and then you've got to let them be the moral authority to tell you how you're a piece of crap.
[02:32:28.868 --> 02:32:29.469]  You get pissed.
[02:32:29.549 --> 02:32:33.235]  So we do have him now and I appreciate Roger Stone's lawyer joining us.
[02:32:33.856 --> 02:32:35.579]  How is Roger doing in spirits?
[02:32:36.493 --> 02:32:39.635]  Because just 24 hours ago, I'm like, oh great, Trump's standing up.
[02:32:39.655 --> 02:32:40.776]  This is so wonderful.
[02:32:41.457 --> 02:32:43.178]  And he's going to pardon Roger.
[02:32:43.218 --> 02:32:47.221]  And then the whole new scandal is the president can't pardon somebody.
[02:32:47.662 --> 02:32:48.422]  You're a lawyer.
[02:32:49.083 --> 02:32:50.424]  You're a smart guy, Tyler.
[02:32:51.224 --> 02:32:53.506]  But anybody can go look at the Constitution.
[02:32:53.866 --> 02:32:55.908]  The president can pardon whoever he wants.
[02:32:56.388 --> 02:33:00.732]  So the idea that the new scandal is that the president was going to pardon somebody?
[02:33:01.775 --> 02:33:07.600]  It's just they're trying to sabotage any regular presidential activity.
[02:33:07.640 --> 02:33:08.261]  Is that accurate?
[02:33:08.842 --> 02:33:17.049]  Yeah, I mean, if the Democrats' scum and the left had their way, at least during the Trump presidency, they would abolish Article 2 of the Constitution.
[02:33:17.269 --> 02:33:21.473]  I mean, the president's pardon power is absolute, and there's no appeal from it.
[02:33:21.493 --> 02:33:23.415]  There's no ability to countermand it.
[02:33:23.435 --> 02:33:24.416]  There's no review of it.
[02:33:24.496 --> 02:33:25.457]  It's absolute.
[02:33:25.497 --> 02:33:25.857]  It's final.
[02:33:27.079 --> 02:33:30.520]  You can pull out a cocktail napkin right now and end the madness with Roger.
[02:33:31.220 --> 02:33:46.604]  You know, and I think Trump wants to, my hope is, and let me tell you something, if he does not pardon Roger or commute his sentence or whatever it be, and there isn't executive clemency and Roger has to face even a minute behind bars, Trump will have lost me and a lot of other Americans too.
[02:33:46.744 --> 02:33:48.985]  No, I agree, because forget Roger.
[02:33:49.065 --> 02:33:49.685]  Roger's great.
[02:33:50.445 --> 02:33:52.987]  It's prima facie power of the presidency.
[02:33:53.287 --> 02:33:57.231]  If they can cow him not to use this basic power, it's ridiculous.
[02:33:58.011 --> 02:33:59.312]  Yeah, and then this is what they try.
[02:33:59.332 --> 02:34:12.403]  This is their this has been their modus operandi for the last 40 odd years is to attempt to drum up a bunch of hypocritical, hyper, you know, hair splitting kind of
[02:34:13.979 --> 02:34:22.681]  What's the word, I guess, sort of tricks and traps in order to make it look as though a normal exercise of power by any Republican is some sort of abuse.
[02:34:23.141 --> 02:34:31.243]  In order to cow and to intimidate Republicans, of which we had plenty of squishy... Exactly, and everyone should just stop bowing down to it.
[02:34:31.543 --> 02:34:32.323]  It's like... That's right.
[02:34:32.603 --> 02:34:33.063]  No, I agree.
[02:34:33.083 --> 02:34:42.005]  And Trump's the first one, I think, who has really just said, you know, in their faces, F you for lack of a, you know, in so many not those words, but you know what I'm saying?
[02:34:42.281 --> 02:34:44.701]  He stuck it right back to them and said, I don't care what you think.
[02:34:44.741 --> 02:34:45.562]  I don't care what you say.
[02:34:45.842 --> 02:34:47.422]  You people are never going to be pleased.
[02:34:47.682 --> 02:34:56.244]  You're never going to be dissuaded from your maniacal path of destroying anybody who's in your way and stands in the way of your power.
[02:34:56.584 --> 02:34:57.904]  So let's just not kid ourselves.
[02:34:57.924 --> 02:35:03.185]  Let's drop the pretense that we've operated on for the last 30 years, where people like George H.W.
[02:35:03.245 --> 02:35:04.685]  Bush, they called him a wimp.
[02:35:04.725 --> 02:35:08.826]  I mean, the guy bent over backwards to accommodate the Democrat junta.
[02:35:09.606 --> 02:35:13.788]  Raising taxes and, you know, everything, anything they wanted as long as... And nothing appeases them.
[02:35:13.849 --> 02:35:14.609]  Nothing, nothing.
[02:35:14.749 --> 02:35:14.909]  Yeah.
[02:35:15.109 --> 02:35:26.936]  And the thing is, what they held over, what they were able to, I think, leverage against the typical Republican sort of establishment as we've known it, has been their militarist overseas designs.
[02:35:27.276 --> 02:35:34.760]  They've been able to sort of say, you know what, you guys can run amok domestically with all this quasi-socialism on the path to socialism.
[02:35:35.280 --> 02:35:41.903]  And just let us have our overseas wars and our interventions and our, you know, military-industrial police stuff and we'll all get along and go along.
[02:35:41.923 --> 02:35:44.484]  Let the socialists do what they want here while they get imperial power.
[02:35:45.224 --> 02:35:45.645]  That's right.
[02:35:45.925 --> 02:35:48.706]  And Trump's the first one to come in and say, what are we doing in the Middle East?
[02:35:49.066 --> 02:35:50.407]  And be serious about it.
[02:35:50.687 --> 02:35:57.190]  And to say, what is going on with, you know, all this corruption that goes unaddressed in the government?
[02:35:57.250 --> 02:36:02.252]  And, you know, look, like I was saying earlier, if Roger Stone had been, if Trump had been smart enough
[02:36:02.782 --> 02:36:09.625]  To not listen to the Palace Guard, who've done him no favors, frankly, who brought in and allowed to fester right underneath his nose.
[02:36:09.905 --> 02:36:12.427]  I mean, Ben Rhodes packed the National Security Council.
[02:36:12.447 --> 02:36:14.868]  They raised the number of people in there from 100 to 250.
[02:36:15.088 --> 02:36:22.511]  I mean, literally up until just recently, you had Obama, Ben Rhodes, and Beds in the National Security Council undermining the President.
[02:36:22.551 --> 02:36:24.652]  Which made them totally disrespect the President.
[02:36:24.712 --> 02:36:31.856]  So, now that he's awake and moving to fire him, that's when Barr activates and comes out and attacks him.
[02:36:32.765 --> 02:36:32.965]  Yeah.
[02:36:33.326 --> 02:36:34.607]  Well, you know, I hate to say it.
[02:36:34.667 --> 02:36:36.348]  I mean, this bar, Durham, all this stuff.
[02:36:36.668 --> 02:36:38.270]  I keep I've heard this so many times.
[02:36:38.310 --> 02:36:39.511]  We've all heard it so many times.
[02:36:39.631 --> 02:36:42.213]  Oh, there's right on the eve of the inspector general reports coming out.
[02:36:42.253 --> 02:36:47.477]  That's going to be these people are ultimately, you know, bars and establishment creature and a bushy.
[02:36:47.677 --> 02:36:49.018]  They're all covering their ass.
[02:36:49.699 --> 02:36:50.499]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:36:50.559 --> 02:36:54.663]  And the problem is they view the larger institution of their
[02:36:55.347 --> 02:37:01.672]  DC-centric, you know, Beltway globalist power is more important than any one outrage or investigation.
[02:37:01.692 --> 02:37:05.755]  But Tyler Nixon, as powerful as they think they are, none of it's working for them now.
[02:37:06.416 --> 02:37:07.737]  They're on defense.
[02:37:07.777 --> 02:37:08.338]  They're falling.
[02:37:08.738 --> 02:37:10.019]  What are they thinking right now?
[02:37:10.079 --> 02:37:13.622]  Because, like, the best they can do is just try to stymie us for a while.
[02:37:13.662 --> 02:37:14.743]  They're losing right now.
[02:37:15.438 --> 02:37:16.379]  They absolutely are.
[02:37:16.839 --> 02:37:24.786]  We have never before in history, and I mean, I've been 36 years in American politics since I was a little kid, volunteering on the Reagan campaign.
[02:37:25.207 --> 02:37:28.950]  I've never seen it this exposed and this out in the open.
[02:37:29.030 --> 02:37:33.194]  And them and the other side, the, you know, the D.C.
[02:37:33.294 --> 02:37:40.020]  so-and-so's, the elites, I've never seen them so scurrying around, acting like crazy, out of control, sort of.
[02:37:40.718 --> 02:37:41.719]  Just gone berserk, really.
[02:37:41.779 --> 02:37:45.242]  I mean, you see the rhetoric has reached such extremes.
[02:37:45.342 --> 02:37:49.845]  Chuck Schumer, I mean, this guy, this clown stands up and Pelosi and them.
[02:37:50.185 --> 02:37:53.268]  And you know, the thing is, you hear it and it's extreme.
[02:37:53.308 --> 02:37:58.551]  And I think it's attempting to demoralize us and to make us feel like, oh my God, they're really on the march.
[02:37:58.772 --> 02:38:08.079]  And this has always been the way the left operates is sound and fury for a tiny percentage of screechers who to basically intimidate us.
[02:38:08.359 --> 02:38:09.640]  What is the way out for Trump?
[02:38:12.136 --> 02:38:13.457]  But like, what about Roger?
[02:38:14.057 --> 02:38:16.038]  I mean, how is he doing under all of this?
[02:38:17.118 --> 02:38:26.140]  Roger is, who would not be buoyed by the last two days, regardless of where it goes, because he has solid grounds, frankly, for appeal and for overturning this.
[02:38:26.160 --> 02:38:34.943]  He has solid grounds for a mistrial now because of these despicable leftist jurors who lied their way onto the jury, as we expected to happen.
[02:38:34.983 --> 02:38:36.583]  I mean, we all knew it was going to happen.
[02:38:36.623 --> 02:38:38.264]  This judge allowed it to happen.
[02:38:38.916 --> 02:38:42.124]  You know, in fact, facilitated it, in my opinion, sitting there listening to her.
[02:38:42.586 --> 02:38:53.092]  Laughable attempts to give the veneer of questioning these people, and certainly not- And in the meanwhile, Michael Avenatti has now been convicted of trying to extort Nike today.
[02:38:53.513 --> 02:38:54.453]  That's breaking.
[02:38:55.114 --> 02:38:59.316]  Yeah, the guy they had on is their savior, their future presidential candidate.
[02:38:59.356 --> 02:39:01.457]  I mean- Remember how he was invincible?
[02:39:01.517 --> 02:39:02.738]  He was this god?
[02:39:03.279 --> 02:39:05.220]  Oh yeah, he was going to debate Trump personally.
[02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:08.822]  I mean, these people's judgment is so piss poor on its face.
[02:39:09.366 --> 02:39:15.431]  And yet, you know, no matter how many times they're discredited and embarrassed and exposed and prove wrong, they still persist.
[02:39:15.831 --> 02:39:20.835]  And so, you know, that's where we need to basically just realize, stop trying to appease these people.
[02:39:20.855 --> 02:39:21.936]  F them.
[02:39:21.956 --> 02:39:22.537]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:39:22.577 --> 02:39:22.877]  Let's go.
[02:39:22.937 --> 02:39:23.317]  No, exactly.
[02:39:23.377 --> 02:39:25.259]  We're going to do what we're going to do.
[02:39:25.319 --> 02:39:25.899]  Use the power.
[02:39:25.919 --> 02:39:27.841]  Use the power you have.
[02:39:28.061 --> 02:39:28.722]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:39:28.902 --> 02:39:29.542]  Absolutely.
[02:39:29.602 --> 02:39:32.225]  So stop laying down, stop letting them run us over.
[02:39:32.265 --> 02:39:36.348]  Stop trying to, you know, for years and to an extent, it sharpened our game.
[02:39:36.633 --> 02:39:44.394]  The fact that they would throw lies at us, they would exaggerate and caricaturize us, made us have to like sharpen our game and always be righteous.
[02:39:44.414 --> 02:39:46.375]  That which does not kill us only makes us stronger.
[02:39:46.415 --> 02:39:50.715]  So I want to talk about the different scenarios with Roger when we come back.
[02:39:51.876 --> 02:39:55.536]  There's no way to describe how real it is on this planet.
[02:39:56.456 --> 02:40:01.497]  Space, the gas giants, the sun, the moon, all of it's real.
[02:40:02.077 --> 02:40:05.178]  Our parents, our children, who we are.
[02:40:06.749 --> 02:40:07.529]  We're all humans.
[02:40:07.749 --> 02:40:09.069]  This is so real right now.
[02:40:09.089 --> 02:40:14.611]  And you can feel the very destiny of humanity being decided right now.
[02:40:15.831 --> 02:40:17.051]  I'm so blessed to be here.
[02:40:18.111 --> 02:40:22.232]  I bet on humanity a long time ago, I believed in humanity.
[02:40:22.972 --> 02:40:31.474]  And I knew that if we simply promoted a pro-human future, that people would buy into that, that we'd have a future.
[02:40:32.874 --> 02:40:33.615]  And now we're here.
[02:40:34.675 --> 02:40:35.495]  The battle's joined.
[02:40:36.752 --> 02:40:40.798]  We're talking to Tyler Nixon, Roger Stone's private lawyer, not his lawyer in these cases.
[02:40:41.739 --> 02:40:42.420]  And, you know...
[02:40:43.578 --> 02:40:44.499]  I've been honest with people.
[02:40:45.099 --> 02:40:50.042]  I've told Roger, hey, come on the air and talk about politics, and you're a smart guy.
[02:40:50.082 --> 02:40:52.243]  We don't want to hear about Russia and how you're innocent.
[02:40:52.263 --> 02:40:53.524]  We know you're innocent, dude.
[02:40:53.824 --> 02:40:55.045]  We know you're not a Russian agent.
[02:40:55.085 --> 02:40:55.665]  Give me a break.
[02:40:56.266 --> 02:40:59.008]  It's like telling a pterodactyl it's Santa Claus.
[02:40:59.348 --> 02:41:00.268]  We know that's not what it is.
[02:41:00.849 --> 02:41:08.754]  But now, Roger, is the big issue, because now it's the new political football to get rid of Trump and that he can't pardon somebody.
[02:41:09.414 --> 02:41:13.858]  Because they think the average American's dumb, like, you can't have a president let somebody go!
[02:41:13.978 --> 02:41:15.299]  I mean, that's crazy!
[02:41:15.539 --> 02:41:16.820]  We never heard of that before!
[02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:23.326]  And if you see that political ignorance they're counting on, but it's not working.
[02:41:23.366 --> 02:41:29.571]  So Tyler, in closing, what are you predicting next week on the 20th?
[02:41:29.631 --> 02:41:31.253]  In fact, what day is...
[02:41:33.817 --> 02:41:34.177]  The 20th.
[02:41:34.197 --> 02:41:34.778]  Is that Thursday?
[02:41:34.798 --> 02:41:35.098]  Friday?
[02:41:35.778 --> 02:41:36.539]  What day is the 20th?
[02:41:36.979 --> 02:41:41.241]  Do you predict that the judge punts and like kicks it out?
[02:41:42.101 --> 02:41:45.083]  Or do they... Say that again, guys?
[02:41:45.123 --> 02:41:47.404]  Man, if I... Can you hear me?
[02:41:48.085 --> 02:41:49.966]  Yeah, they're like popping in on me, talking to me.
[02:41:50.026 --> 02:41:50.526]  I don't know.
[02:41:50.546 --> 02:41:52.067]  They're like giving me audio.
[02:41:52.087 --> 02:41:52.327]  Sure.
[02:41:52.707 --> 02:41:54.248]  Well, first I... Hold on, Tyler.
[02:41:54.288 --> 02:41:55.889]  Let me hear what they have to say.
[02:41:55.909 --> 02:41:57.089]  Sure.
[02:41:57.149 --> 02:41:57.750]  It's next Thursday.
[02:41:57.790 --> 02:41:58.230]  Okay, thank you.
[02:41:58.510 --> 02:41:59.090]  It's next Thursday.
[02:41:59.110 --> 02:41:59.831]  Please continue, Tyler.
[02:42:00.868 --> 02:42:11.214]  Well, I just want to first affirm what you said at the beginning and thank you and tell you how much so many of us appreciate your approach to things, which is a human approach.
[02:42:11.394 --> 02:42:16.137]  Humanity is where it's at and the hopes for humanity, the prospect.
[02:42:16.693 --> 02:42:26.205]  That we will overcome these evil elements, these demonic in many cases, elements that run amongst us and have deceived mankind for so long.
[02:42:26.606 --> 02:42:32.974]  And I think so many people's eyes are open now and I think you've been a leader in that and bringing attention to that on that level of
[02:42:33.462 --> 02:42:35.323]  You know, this is a planetary thing.
[02:42:35.383 --> 02:42:39.345]  This is the future of our species, basically.
[02:42:39.365 --> 02:42:48.029]  It's so important because it puts things in perspective, I think, when we get involved in the weeds of these political trash who are always trying to tie everybody up.
[02:42:48.069 --> 02:42:48.469]  They're right.
[02:42:48.489 --> 02:42:49.750]  It's just good versus evil.
[02:42:50.650 --> 02:42:54.632]  And snare us in their intrigues and all their sophistry.
[02:42:55.257 --> 02:43:05.065]  Uh, you know, if I could predict what this judge is going to do, uh, you know, I think I'd be, I'd probably be a lot more wealthy than I am, which is not much, but that being said, she's going to serve the devil.
[02:43:05.085 --> 02:43:06.026]  That's what she's going to do.
[02:43:06.286 --> 02:43:06.526]  Yeah.
[02:43:06.566 --> 02:43:07.747]  She's going to do, she's going to try it.
[02:43:07.807 --> 02:43:10.750]  She's going to try to, I think to some extent, justify herself.
[02:43:11.528 --> 02:43:11.868]  I don't
[02:43:29.875 --> 02:43:32.276]  The contours of the case to where he can't post anything.
[02:43:32.476 --> 02:43:35.257]  He can't wish his wife a happy birthday on Facebook, you know?
[02:43:35.778 --> 02:43:38.719]  But, you know, that being said, look, the four Stooges are gone.
[02:43:38.739 --> 02:43:42.640]  These Olinsky, Cravis, Jed, whatever, Miranda scum.
[02:43:42.660 --> 02:43:45.082]  Yeah, the left thought they were invincible.
[02:43:45.162 --> 02:43:48.643]  They thought that they were going to have victory in all this criminality.
[02:43:48.963 --> 02:43:51.144]  But now that it's not turning up, what do they do next?
[02:43:52.565 --> 02:43:57.347]  Well, you know, the judge, I think, is going to, I think she's going to try to give him
[02:43:57.975 --> 02:44:01.797]  Enough to make it hurt, but not so much that it prompts an outcry.
[02:44:01.817 --> 02:44:18.285]  I don't think she realizes, though, that at this point, with the revelations concerning this prosecutorial corruption, which all of us in the team have known about, well, you know, those of us close to Roger have known about all along, from get-go, what a put-up witch hunt show trial this has been.
[02:44:19.026 --> 02:44:26.510]  But with all that, and now these revelations of tainted jurors, and this Tamika Hart, who was, you know, a congressional, I mean,
[02:44:27.350 --> 02:44:28.051]  It's just insane.
[02:44:28.091 --> 02:44:38.758]  I don't think she's going to have... Listen, do you remember when they said arrest me because we pointed out that the woman headed up a federal agency and that her husband was on the Mueller report?
[02:44:39.499 --> 02:44:44.783]  I mean... Yeah, the problem is you can't distinguish the media matters propaganda from what the court or anybody else...
[02:44:45.245 --> 02:44:45.485]  Let's
[02:45:04.224 --> 02:45:05.786]  That's just a propaganda talking point.
[02:45:06.007 --> 02:45:07.268]  It's absolutely true.
[02:45:07.549 --> 02:45:18.264]  I mean literally in the filing concerning that called you out for mentioning Roger and just passing along that his sentiment was he hoped for a pardon.
[02:45:18.897 --> 02:45:22.320]  Uh, and they distorted that into somehow, you know, attributing it to Roger.
[02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:25.102]  Well, he was in the news saying, I trust in God and a pardon.
[02:45:25.502 --> 02:45:26.943]  He said, I trust in God and a pardon.
[02:45:26.983 --> 02:45:27.684]  I quoted that.
[02:45:28.004 --> 02:45:30.546]  I said, Roger is trusting God and a pardon.
[02:45:32.107 --> 02:45:33.188]  Why can't he say that?
[02:45:33.388 --> 02:45:33.549]  Yeah.
[02:45:33.589 --> 02:45:33.729]  Yeah.
[02:45:33.769 --> 02:45:35.430]  I'm sorry, but we need to push back this.
[02:45:35.550 --> 02:45:44.317]  And this is another thing that irks me about his, uh, his legal, his defense team is for, well, in addition to having thrown him under the bus when that first
[02:45:44.718 --> 02:45:45.318]  We're good to go.
[02:46:06.587 --> 02:46:13.612]  And basically set him up to let this judge shove his own lawyer's words in his face at every subsequent tightening of the gag order.
[02:46:14.052 --> 02:46:31.424]  But, you know, my personal counsel, and this is just as a friend to Roger, and by the way, I don't speak for Roger in any way, I just want to get that clear, and I know you've said it as well, I do not speak for Roger, he doesn't prompt me, he doesn't tell me what to say, I don't tell him what to say, but if I were him at this point, I would come out and say,
[02:46:31.932 --> 02:46:32.833]  I'm done being gagged.
[02:46:33.053 --> 02:46:35.915]  I live in a free country and we're going to keep it this way.
[02:46:36.315 --> 02:46:37.796]  The First Amendment gives me this right.
[02:46:37.936 --> 02:46:42.099]  Oh yeah, they totally fear his speech during this whole fiasco.
[02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:46.702]  Yeah, they'd rather have him silenced, unable to defend himself.
[02:46:47.122 --> 02:46:55.087]  And I think it's in order somewhat to his benefit in the sense that, well, it's also in order to our relief, because when you can't speak and you can't get
[02:46:56.003 --> 02:46:57.624]  You know, he can't stand up for himself.
[02:46:57.925 --> 02:46:59.446]  You start to worry that people have forgotten.
[02:46:59.846 --> 02:47:01.727]  And have forgotten the plight that you're suffering.
[02:47:01.747 --> 02:47:03.148]  Oh, they've certainly not forgotten now.
[02:47:03.189 --> 02:47:04.990]  They're totally pissed.
[02:47:05.070 --> 02:47:07.031]  And Trump needs to part in stone right now.
[02:47:07.111 --> 02:47:07.832]  Alright, Tyler.
[02:47:07.852 --> 02:47:08.112]  He does.
[02:47:08.452 --> 02:47:10.094]  Tyler Nixon, thank you so much.
[02:47:10.134 --> 02:47:11.394]  How do folks follow you on Twitter?
[02:47:12.615 --> 02:47:15.297]  At Tyler P, as in Patrick, Nixon dot com.
[02:47:15.678 --> 02:47:16.939]  Oh no, excuse me, not dot com.
[02:47:17.039 --> 02:47:17.919]  At Tyler P Nixon.
[02:47:18.560 --> 02:47:19.220]  And that's it.
[02:47:19.260 --> 02:47:22.983]  But hey Alex, we appreciate, you know, you've been supportive throughout
[02:47:23.747 --> 02:47:24.148]  I don't know.
[02:47:39.318 --> 02:47:41.000]  This is all a ridiculous fiasco.
[02:47:41.360 --> 02:47:48.507]  We're all a bunch of cowards, all a bunch of lawyers that sit around all day kissing each other's asses and trying to figure out what side to be on.
[02:47:48.527 --> 02:47:49.608]  They're not leaders.
[02:47:49.669 --> 02:47:52.872]  They don't say, this is the right thing to do, we're gonna do this.
[02:47:53.232 --> 02:47:53.773]  But I am!
[02:47:55.913 --> 02:47:56.773]  Because that's all I've got.
[02:47:57.273 --> 02:48:00.874]  I will never have a committee meeting about the right thing to do.
[02:48:00.954 --> 02:48:06.476]  I will never sit down with a bunch of people and decide how do I make a better position for myself.
[02:48:06.496 --> 02:48:16.618]  Man, back when they offered me $10 million and a book deal like 15, 16 years ago, I've since weighed more than $10 million.
[02:48:16.678 --> 02:48:21.719]  But it was $10 million to fund an operation and do what I wanted.
[02:48:22.179 --> 02:48:23.140]  That was real money.
[02:48:23.560 --> 02:48:24.240]  That was value.
[02:48:26.388 --> 02:48:35.432]  The average person thinks success is finally getting there where the establishment goes, here's the money, you're with us now.
[02:48:38.293 --> 02:48:43.675]  But I already had the Kissinger Group and others offer me all the money and all the power.
[02:48:43.875 --> 02:48:46.536]  I don't want to be with them.
[02:48:48.577 --> 02:48:50.057]  In fact, I want to pour gasoline on them.
[02:48:51.098 --> 02:48:53.459]  I mean, I'm not a violent person, except I really am.
[02:48:54.381 --> 02:48:57.484]  And I'm not going to do this myself.
[02:48:58.064 --> 02:49:00.506]  I'm going to do this through all of us.
[02:49:01.247 --> 02:49:04.250]  And I just really want human success.
[02:49:04.910 --> 02:49:08.473]  And I don't like a bunch of chicken shits working against humanity.
[02:49:09.274 --> 02:49:12.017]  And I want them to know there's people that aren't for sale.
[02:49:13.083 --> 02:49:17.367]  And there are people that will get their hands around your neck until your eyeballs pop out of your head.
[02:49:18.167 --> 02:49:33.881]  And so, that's really what this broadcast is all about, is a big F you to the Satan worshippers, and the pedophiles, and the control freaks, and everybody that wants to get in little clubs and decide that you've really made it because you're part of the system.
[02:49:34.401 --> 02:49:36.483]  I'm here to blow your system up.
[02:49:37.784 --> 02:49:39.686]  And I'm here to run ice picks through your eyes.
[02:49:41.092 --> 02:49:43.573]  And if I die in the process, well, that's even better, isn't it?
[02:49:45.973 --> 02:49:47.254]  Because you people are cowards.
[02:49:47.454 --> 02:49:48.574]  And I don't mean our audience.
[02:49:48.634 --> 02:49:50.195]  Our audience is the best people on earth.
[02:49:50.835 --> 02:49:56.196]  But the people that serve Satan... You're gonna burn in hell.
[02:49:57.897 --> 02:49:59.857]  And I'm gonna make sure that happens.
[02:50:00.837 --> 02:50:02.578]  So, uh, the war room's coming up.
[02:50:02.598 --> 02:50:04.959]  We had a really good four-hour show today.
[02:50:04.979 --> 02:50:08.300]  And I really appreciate the crew doing an amazing job.
[02:50:09.100 --> 02:50:09.340]  So...
[02:50:10.697 --> 02:50:11.719]  The war room's coming up.
[02:50:11.959 --> 02:50:13.020]  Don't spread the links.
[02:50:13.561 --> 02:50:14.963]  Don't tell people about the show.
[02:50:15.805 --> 02:50:17.908]  Just bow down to the world government, okay?
[02:50:18.649 --> 02:50:21.753]  Just give up, give up, give up, give up.
[02:50:21.874 --> 02:50:22.675]  Actually, don't do that.
[02:50:35.680 --> 02:50:39.443]  Now it's easier than ever to have BAN.VIDEO on your iPhone.
[02:50:39.983 --> 02:50:43.226]  Simply go to BAN.VIDEO with your Safari browser.
[02:50:43.466 --> 02:50:46.148]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[02:50:46.749 --> 02:50:49.611]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[02:50:50.291 --> 02:50:51.993]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[02:50:52.553 --> 02:50:53.994]  I suggest BAN.VIDEO.
[02:50:54.635 --> 02:50:59.739]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[02:51:00.099 --> 02:51:03.902]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them
[02:51:04.242 --> 02:51:08.025]  Have the app and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[02:51:08.545 --> 02:51:14.949]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[02:51:15.269 --> 02:51:18.071]  However you want, be sure and share Band.Video.
[02:51:27.697 --> 02:51:38.422]  I told you two weeks ago that almost all the other major food distributors were actually sold out of food and trying to now buy up more food.
[02:51:39.258 --> 02:51:53.223]  But then our big sponsor that we've had for over 10 years, MyPaperSupply, had plenty of food on hand, but they were honest that there was a 7 to 10 day wait because they had to package it running 24 hours a day, three or four times the biggest volume of ordering that they've ever seen.
[02:51:53.783 --> 02:52:05.087]  With Homeland Security and with FEMA and with the Office of Personnel, all of them trying to call and buy up whatever food they had for their quarantine centers around the United States.
[02:52:05.247 --> 02:52:06.308]  Remember, that was two weeks ago.
[02:52:06.328 --> 02:52:10.670]  I told you they're setting up quarantine centers and they want emergency backup food for folks inside quarantine centers.
[02:52:10.950 --> 02:52:11.510]  And the U.S.
[02:52:11.530 --> 02:52:15.132]  government already has huge stockpiles of storable food, so why would they be wanting even more?
[02:52:15.152 --> 02:52:21.295]  Because a lot of it's 20, 30 years old and the government employees want good stuff and they know MyPatriot's good, but they're buying up everything already.
[02:52:21.375 --> 02:52:23.816]  Now, a lot of these other companies, I don't have them as sponsors.
[02:52:23.896 --> 02:52:25.817]  I could have six, seven food sponsors right now.
[02:52:25.937 --> 02:52:31.780]  I don't because I learned early on, if there's not a big rush and there's nothing going on, they got the food and, you know, it's okay.
[02:52:32.100 --> 02:52:32.521]  We're good to go.
[02:52:49.464 --> 02:52:52.465]  And you get it just as fast as anybody else that orders from them.
[02:52:52.725 --> 02:52:53.946]  And it supports the operation.
[02:52:54.186 --> 02:52:56.126]  And now it's 10 to 14 days.
[02:52:56.306 --> 02:52:57.767]  They're right at about 10 days right now.
[02:52:57.807 --> 02:53:00.948]  I just wanted to say 10 to 14 because the orders aren't going down.
[02:53:01.008 --> 02:53:04.289]  They're intensifying because folks know this is really serious now.
[02:53:04.329 --> 02:53:12.372]  But for 2020, for economic issues down the road, for inflation, for a possible depression, for any reason, this is insurance you can eat.
[02:53:12.952 --> 02:53:15.513]  This is stuff that you can save and know that you're always going to use.
[02:53:15.533 --> 02:53:18.433]  If you don't use your car insurance or your medical, well, it's money lost.
[02:53:18.473 --> 02:53:21.794]  But with this, it tastes as good as 10 years as it does today.
[02:53:21.914 --> 02:53:25.875]  And a lot of this food is indistinguishable from gourmet-type stuff you get at the store.
[02:53:25.935 --> 02:53:26.935]  Some of it tastes okay.
[02:53:26.995 --> 02:53:29.995]  But for the price, you're getting the best high-quality stuff there is out there.
[02:53:30.035 --> 02:53:31.036]  Nobody can come close.
[02:53:31.076 --> 02:53:32.716]  They're cheaper than all the major competitors.
[02:53:32.916 --> 02:53:35.957]  And they want to be so that you come back to them over and over again.
[02:53:35.977 --> 02:53:37.557]  They're now the biggest storable food company.
[02:53:37.697 --> 02:53:37.817]  Yeah.
[02:53:54.437 --> 02:54:06.964]  It's there, it's available right now, and I would advise everybody, if you've been on the fence about a four-week supply, about a three-month supply, about a six-month supply, about a year's supply, this is something that everybody that can should have.
[02:54:07.024 --> 02:54:10.607]  And it's in these great, high-quality plastic tote containers that are sealed.
[02:54:10.627 --> 02:54:13.208]  Then it's got sealed packaging inside of that.
[02:54:13.288 --> 02:54:14.669]  It's absolutely filled to the brim.
[02:54:14.809 --> 02:54:16.530]  You're not paying for air here, folks.
[02:54:16.670 --> 02:54:18.571]  This is the best bang for your buck out there.
[02:54:18.591 --> 02:54:21.473]  That's why they are our supplier.
[02:54:21.633 --> 02:54:29.398]  So don't wait anymore, go to m4store.com, get your order in today, and know that you will be at the front of the line to get it as quickly as possible.
[02:54:29.438 --> 02:54:36.543]  You get it in, it's guaranteed 10 to 14 days, they have the food, it's just that they've got to package it, and it is crazy, the volume.
[02:54:36.683 --> 02:54:38.525]  It just does not exist out there.
[02:54:38.765 --> 02:54:44.309]  And I was there two weeks ago, and they were saying, should we spend everything we get coming in to order more food for other folks?
[02:54:44.329 --> 02:54:45.329]  Do you think this is how bad?
[02:54:45.369 --> 02:54:47.571]  I said, yeah, no, I think your gut level's right.
[02:54:47.611 --> 02:54:48.452]  I said, go all in.
[02:54:49.432 --> 02:54:54.376]  I think unfortunately, you know, in a month you'll be selling more food than you are now, because I think this is pretty serious.
[02:54:54.396 --> 02:54:55.777]  The response we're seeing is really serious.
[02:54:55.837 --> 02:54:57.238]  And regardless, 2020 is a crazy year.
[02:54:57.258 --> 02:54:58.399]  People need to be prepared.
[02:54:59.139 --> 02:55:02.642]  And so they've purchased a ton more food, and it's all coming in, all getting ready.
[02:55:02.662 --> 02:55:06.965]  But you order now, you're ordering food they have in stock that you will get.
[02:55:07.065 --> 02:55:08.566]  But I would not wait any more.
[02:55:08.646 --> 02:55:09.306]  What's going on?
[02:55:09.847 --> 02:55:12.368]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:55:12.408 --> 02:55:15.871]  They have a lot of specialty meals, you name it.
[02:55:16.411 --> 02:55:17.192]  Amazing food.
[02:55:17.232 --> 02:55:17.652]  Get it today.
[02:55:27.751 --> 02:55:38.244]  I almost feel opportunistic when I'm positioned with the very nano-silver that the Pentagon and Homeland Security has said has been proven to take out SARS.
[02:55:38.424 --> 02:55:38.965]  But you know what?
[02:55:39.085 --> 02:55:40.166]  I've been selling it for years.
[02:55:40.447 --> 02:55:41.888]  So, that's what this comes down to.
[02:55:42.049 --> 02:55:46.294]  I sold out of this yesterday, as I told you, but still kept it discounted, the 16-ounce bottles.
[02:55:46.394 --> 02:55:49.779]  We're selling out of the 1-ounce bottles very, very quickly as well.
[02:55:49.799 --> 02:55:50.720]  A little spray bottle.
[02:55:50.740 --> 02:55:52.763]  This will sell out within a week, the 3-ounce bottles.
[02:55:52.903 --> 02:55:54.025]  And it's just high quality.
[02:55:54.185 --> 02:55:55.226]  And is it a silver bullet?
[02:55:55.387 --> 02:56:01.956]  No, but they call it a silver bullet in lore because silver is just a metal-based antibiotic-type system.
[02:56:02.216 --> 02:56:03.537]  And again, it's not perfect.
[02:56:03.597 --> 02:56:04.578]  Consult your physician.
[02:56:04.738 --> 02:56:07.579]  It's something that I normally just gargle with a couple times a week.
[02:56:07.680 --> 02:56:09.621]  But you can actually, this is approved to drink.
[02:56:09.641 --> 02:56:11.362]  That's why it's at 15 parts, but it's nano.
[02:56:11.482 --> 02:56:17.426]  Just remember, any antibiotic, whether it's the classic antibiotics or whether it's metals-based, has its downside as well.
[02:56:18.939 --> 02:56:21.940]  My dad was basically on death's doorstep six years ago.
[02:56:22.420 --> 02:56:27.601]  My uncle, his uncle, and my cousin had all died, lived at the same ranch, from the same bad pneumonia.
[02:56:28.281 --> 02:56:31.122]  I came in when the doctors couldn't help my dad, he'd been on three different antibiotics.
[02:56:31.742 --> 02:56:36.283]  I could tell he was going the same way, and I just basically assaulted him and poured three bottles of colloidal silver down him.
[02:56:36.703 --> 02:56:37.903]  Well, this was even better than that.
[02:56:37.943 --> 02:56:39.503]  By the way, my dad pissed green for a week.
[02:56:39.923 --> 02:56:42.484]  Sure, it wasn't good for his liver and kidneys, but he came back and lived, okay?
[02:56:42.924 --> 02:56:43.884]  Am I saying that did that?
[02:56:44.365 --> 02:56:46.826]  I just didn't put it in God's hands.
[02:56:46.886 --> 02:56:49.046]  I took action because God helps those that help themselves.
[02:56:49.587 --> 02:56:52.868]  So what I'm getting at here is we're selling out of this silver.
[02:56:52.888 --> 02:56:54.028]  We're keeping it discounted.
[02:56:54.088 --> 02:56:55.429]  We're sold out of the colloil silver.
[02:56:55.509 --> 02:56:56.609]  That hadn't come back in yet.
[02:56:57.550 --> 02:56:59.251]  It was already sold out before this crisis began.
[02:56:59.271 --> 02:57:01.611]  We have the great storable foods in case you've got a shelter in place.
[02:57:02.052 --> 02:57:04.753]  But I have that just because you should be self-sufficient and ready.
[02:57:05.113 --> 02:57:07.694]  All the other big suppliers we know of have already sold out.
[02:57:07.994 --> 02:57:08.954]  We're still taking your orders.
[02:57:09.415 --> 02:57:09.995]  Our supplier
[02:57:10.575 --> 02:57:16.119]  Has the food they've got to package it and they called me two days ago and said you got to tell listeners it's now 10 to 14.
[02:57:16.499 --> 02:57:17.420]  I said is it really 10 to 14?
[02:57:17.580 --> 02:57:26.287]  They said yeah in a few days it'll start being 10 days and then we've got the food but it's just it's increasing institutional buyers are trying to buy it up and that's what scares them.
[02:57:26.447 --> 02:57:29.169]  I had talks two weeks ago with the owner and the founder and the
[02:57:29.469 --> 02:57:29.830]  I don't
[02:57:44.346 --> 02:57:46.929]  Sure enough, unfortunately, you see this is serious.
[02:57:46.969 --> 02:57:48.350]  So, it's good to be prepared.
[02:57:48.550 --> 02:57:49.571]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:57:49.611 --> 02:57:51.713]  It funds our independent Maverick operation.
[02:57:51.934 --> 02:57:52.674]  It's storable food.
[02:57:52.714 --> 02:57:53.355]  It's high quality.
[02:57:53.735 --> 02:57:56.498]  And we have the best nano silver you're going to find out there.
[02:57:56.518 --> 02:57:59.521]  I mean, the super silver wound gel is the same nano, but it's super strong.
[02:57:59.541 --> 02:58:00.502]  You can't ingest this.
[02:58:00.862 --> 02:58:02.404]  This is private labeled in stores.
[02:58:02.884 --> 02:58:03.905]  They have this in hospitals.
[02:58:04.226 --> 02:58:05.367]  These are great patriots.
[02:58:05.447 --> 02:58:06.388]  Here's the company right here.
[02:58:06.408 --> 02:58:07.589]  They want their name said.
[02:58:07.629 --> 02:58:08.250]  I've been with them, like,
[02:58:08.610 --> 02:58:13.053]  Six, seven years, but it's American Biotech Labs out of Colorado.
[02:58:13.173 --> 02:58:19.077]  Here's all the Pentagon documents, Department of the Army, Headquarters Army, Homeland Security, A&M, talking about how amazing it is.
[02:58:19.137 --> 02:58:19.938]  Is it a silver bullet?
[02:58:19.998 --> 02:58:22.540]  No, but it's just one more defense and it funds the M4.
