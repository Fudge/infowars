[00:00:02.016 --> 00:00:03.437]  Sorry folks, park's closed.
[00:00:03.877 --> 00:00:07.560]  We were here a week ago and this one entrance was closed.
[00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.741]  There were no cars here.
[00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:14.244]  But here we are a week later and it's open and hundreds of people are enjoying the Austin Greenbelt.
[00:00:14.825 --> 00:00:17.046]  And that's what this exercise of freedom is about.
[00:00:17.486 --> 00:00:21.529]  All over the world they're closing outdoor facilities under the COVID hoax.
[00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:25.652]  We're here because in Australia and in Spain and in Canada
[00:00:26.312 --> 00:00:30.795]  And in Austin, and in California, they're trying to keep the beaches and the parks closed.
[00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:36.218]  And humanity is saying, no, we will not bow down to you!
[00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.320]  We will go outside!
[00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.241]  We will enjoy God's creation!
[00:00:40.261 --> 00:00:41.942]  We got it!
[00:00:41.982 --> 00:00:43.042]  We got it!
[00:00:43.062 --> 00:00:44.924]  We got it!
[00:00:45.084 --> 00:00:53.289]  We are here to exercise our First Amendment, and our right to travel, and our right to use the public amenities.
[00:00:57.991 --> 00:01:10.835]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are here because the United Nations on record launched the COVID hoax and counts all the regular pneumonia and flus that do kill people as it to scare everyone.
[00:01:11.155 --> 00:01:22.579]  But we are here in defiance of this evil and we are here saying humanity knows we're under attack and we're taking the planet back from the global host.
[00:01:24.983 --> 00:01:28.265]  This is a quarter mile hike down, quarter mile up, so get plenty of water.
[00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:31.006]  We're out here exercising our free speech, and I salute and thank you all for being here!
[00:01:31.026 --> 00:01:31.186]  Yeah!
[00:01:31.206 --> 00:01:31.587]  Let's go!
[00:01:31.607 --> 00:01:31.807]  Let's go!
[00:01:31.827 --> 00:01:32.067]  Let's go!
[00:01:32.087 --> 00:01:32.347]  Let's go!
[00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:32.547]  Let's go!
[00:01:32.567 --> 00:01:32.767]  Let's go!
[00:01:32.787 --> 00:01:32.947]  Let's go!
[00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:33.247]  Let's go!
[00:01:33.287 --> 00:01:33.568]  Let's go!
[00:01:33.588 --> 00:01:36.709]  Let's go!
[00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.790]  Let's go!
[00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.170]  Let's go!
[00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.753]  Let's go!
[00:01:43.373 --> 00:01:44.554]  Let's go!
[00:01:44.574 --> 00:01:44.754]  Let's go!
[00:01:44.774 --> 00:01:44.974]  Let's go!
[00:01:44.994 --> 00:01:45.274]  Let's go!
[00:01:45.294 --> 00:01:45.454]  Let's go!
[00:01:45.474 --> 00:01:46.615]  Let's go!
[00:01:46.655 --> 00:01:46.815]  Let's go!
[00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:47.015]  Let's go!
[00:01:47.035 --> 00:01:47.255]  Let's go!
[00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:47.435]  Let's go!
[00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:47.635]  Let's go!
[00:01:47.655 --> 00:01:47.895]  Let's go!
[00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:48.135]  Let's go!
[00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:48.436]  Let's go!
[00:01:48.456 --> 00:01:48.656]  Let's go!
[00:01:48.696 --> 00:01:48.896]  Let's go!
[00:01:48.916 --> 00:01:49.116]  Let's go!
[00:01:49.136 --> 00:01:49.336]  Let's go!
[00:01:49.376 --> 00:01:49.536]  Let's go!
[00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:49.716]  Let's go!
[00:01:49.736 --> 00:01:49.936]  Let's go!
[00:01:49.956 --> 00:01:50.157]  Let's go!
[00:01:50.197 --> 00:01:50.377]  Let's go!
[00:01:50.397 --> 00:01:50.617]  Let's go!
[00:01:50.637 --> 00:01:50.977]  Let's go!
[00:01:50.997 --> 00:01:51.237]  Let's go!
[00:01:51.257 --> 00:01:51.437]  Let's go!
[00:01:51.457 --> 00:01:51.617]  Let's go!
[00:01:51.637 --> 00:01:51.797]  Let's go!
[00:01:51.817 --> 00:01:52.018]  Let's go!
[00:01:52.038 --> 00:01:52.218]  Let's go!
[00:01:52.238 --> 00:01:52.538]  Let's go!
[00:01:52.558 --> 00:01:52.738]  Let's go!
[00:02:17.853 --> 00:02:20.022]  No matter what, we just have to maintain America.
[00:02:20.364 --> 00:02:22.372]  In Jesus' name, America!
[00:02:30.513 --> 00:02:32.794]  This is what it's all about, humanity just being humans.
[00:02:32.994 --> 00:02:40.596]  They want to end humans as we know it, they want to genetically program everybody, and they want us out of nature, in our houses, on VR, under their control.
[00:02:40.856 --> 00:02:48.479]  And these folks are here as the tip of the spear for all of humanity, saying we're keeping the human planet open, we're not the post-civil war!
[00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:57.329]  Next Saturday, Martin Springs to Freeside is crystal clear.
[00:02:57.669 --> 00:02:58.910]  It's only a 100-yard walk.
[00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:00.371]  I'm going to be out there.
[00:03:00.391 --> 00:03:01.972]  I don't care what the city says.
[00:03:02.272 --> 00:03:04.094]  I'm going to pay for a professional food truck.
[00:03:10.118 --> 00:03:11.058]  Here's to freedom!
[00:03:11.138 --> 00:03:17.343]  And here's to all of you out here in defiance to the tyrant!
[00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:27.731]  You guys are badass, don't thank me.
[00:03:28.271 --> 00:03:29.913]  Great job kicking ass, folks!
[00:03:33.957 --> 00:03:34.497]  Actually bought this.
[00:03:34.517 --> 00:03:36.359]  It blocks UHS frequencies.
[00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:41.364]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us.
[00:03:41.824 --> 00:03:48.090]  Not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well.
[00:03:48.691 --> 00:03:50.332]  With or without a battery.
[00:03:51.113 --> 00:03:56.497]  Now, with the InfoWars Privacy Pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[00:03:57.198 --> 00:03:57.658]  Excellent.
[00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:03.203]  Now I have my own compact Faraday cage I can take wherever I want.
[00:04:03.663 --> 00:04:07.606]  And you can, too, at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:04:08.267 --> 00:04:18.335]  Government agencies, identity thieves, tech giants, and now contact tracers are all tracking your every move through your mobile phone.
