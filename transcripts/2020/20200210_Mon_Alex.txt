[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:17.439]  Look back at the beginning of February 2020 as a true rollercoaster in American history that saw populism victorious over anti-American forces that were crushed under the weight of Providence, real popular opinion, and the hubris of their own statements.
[00:00:17.998 --> 00:00:21.261]  We must remove this president to protect our country.
[00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:27.426]  For the rest of his life, he's also gonna, people are also gonna remember he was impeached by the House of Representatives.
[00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:35.052]  He was, and as Nancy Pelosi kept saying, because she understood, once the House was done, what the outcome was gonna be in the Senate forever, forever, forever.
[00:00:35.052 --> 00:00:42.678]  The impeachment only revealed the severity of the true threat that Democrats have become to the foundation of our republic.
[00:00:43.098 --> 00:00:51.060]  The Constitution requires that the House conduct the investigation, including calling witnesses, taking depositions, collecting evidence.
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:57.241]  And the Senate is charged to rule based on the evidence the House provides.
[00:00:57.241 --> 00:01:02.222]  This was designed this way for a very specific reason, a very practical reason.
[00:01:02.222 --> 00:01:08.743]  In the House, committees can investigate these charges while the rest of the House continues to do their legislative work.
[00:01:09.617 --> 00:01:21.266]  Unfortunately, in the Senate, when articles of impeachment are brought and sent to the Senate, the Senate, by constitutional law, must stop what it's doing, must open an impeachment hearing.
[00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:28.712]  While an informal, a formal impeachment hearing, the Senate cannot do anything else by law.
[00:01:28.712 --> 00:01:32.695]  It goes into legislative shutdown by law.
[00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:39.000]  In this case, if we were to call additional witnesses, then we would be setting a dangerous precedent for every future case.
[00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:45.441]  Democrats like Senator Coons of Delaware continue to spew statements like this.
[00:01:45.441 --> 00:01:53.503]  The legendary Senator from West Virginia, Robert Byrd, rose and said, I think my country sinks beneath the yoke.
[00:01:53.503 --> 00:01:57.905]  It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day a gash is added to her wounds.
[00:01:58.629 --> 00:02:20.617]  Don't the Democrats know that the rest of us are completely aware that they began as a pro-slavery party, created the Ku Klux Klan, saw to it that Margaret Sanger's extermination plan was carried out, and even in February of 2020 continued to immortalize bigots within their own party, as Coons did with exalted Cyclops, Robert Byrd.
[00:02:20.617 --> 00:02:27.299]  With regards to Hunter Biden, taking excessive advantage of his father's name is unsavory, but also not a crime.
[00:02:28.976 --> 00:02:45.446]  Given that in neither the case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the President's counsel that a crime had been committed, the President's insistence that they be investigated by the Ukrainians is hard to explain other than as a political pursuit.
[00:02:46.326 --> 00:03:08.312]  While Mitt Romney, a turncoat who claimed his religion guided his decision to convict the president, apparently doesn't realize we all know it's because Mitt Romney's top advisor Joseph Kofor Black sat on the same corrupt board at the Ukrainian energy company Burisma at the same time Hunter Biden was raking in millions for political influence.
[00:03:08.312 --> 00:03:14.054]  I don't like people who use their faith as justification
[00:03:15.615 --> 00:03:19.706]  For doing what they know is wrong.
[00:03:19.706 --> 00:03:22.333]  Nor do I like people who say, I pray for you.
[00:03:24.773 --> 00:03:28.135]  When they know that that's not so.
[00:03:28.135 --> 00:03:31.156]  But of course, the madness was hardly over.
[00:03:31.156 --> 00:03:43.462]  President Trump delivered a historic State of the Union, while the Democrats, like spoiled children, refused to stand for anything that didn't adhere to their hatred of true American values.
[00:03:43.462 --> 00:03:52.627]  Members of Congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in Washington are victories that deliver for the American people.
[00:03:57.605 --> 00:04:12.916]  We must always remember that our job is to put America first.
[00:04:12.916 --> 00:04:16.979]  And now the Democrats are falling apart.
[00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:19.581]  This is not going particularly well so far.
[00:04:19.581 --> 00:04:22.843]  And why is Tom Perez still the chairman of the Democratic National Committee?
[00:04:22.843 --> 00:04:23.544]  I have no idea.
[00:04:24.569 --> 00:04:30.892]  This party needs to wake up and make sure that we talk about things that are relevant to people.
[00:04:30.892 --> 00:04:38.735]  We need to go back to 2018 where we had good, diverse, strong candidates that had real connections to the community and talked about real things.
[00:04:38.735 --> 00:04:41.156]  We don't need to become the British Labour Party.
[00:04:41.156 --> 00:04:42.817]  That's a bad thing.
[00:04:42.817 --> 00:04:52.561]  And as they face the backlash of the hell they brought upon the executive office and the American people, all anyone can say is that it's long overdue.
[00:04:52.561 --> 00:04:53.802]  John Bowne reporting.
[00:04:56.516 --> 00:04:57.276]  We'll be right back.
[00:04:57.276 --> 00:05:00.437]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.437 --> 00:05:04.559]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Infowar, but I know you're like me.
[00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:06.479]  You don't want my thanks.
[00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:12.441]  You want victory over the globalists and these devil worship and child molesters, and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:13.622]  And you know what?
[00:05:13.622 --> 00:05:16.903]  I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[00:05:16.903 --> 00:05:21.244]  And it's why Infowars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to
[00:05:23.519 --> 00:05:31.583]  Focus the people on taking action against the globalists, because I'm committed to a future for humanity, and I know you are as well.
[00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:39.687]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us, because you are the Infowar, and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[00:05:39.687 --> 00:05:48.391]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family, and from the great crew at Infowars, I want to thank you all because you are the Infowar, and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[00:05:49.443 --> 00:05:51.065]  You have made history.
[00:05:51.065 --> 00:05:52.947]  We have made history together.
[00:05:52.947 --> 00:05:57.511]  Infowars.com only has power because of you.
[00:05:57.511 --> 00:05:59.313]  And I suggest you use it.
[00:06:12.032 --> 00:06:13.173]  Big Brother.
[00:06:13.173 --> 00:06:14.973]  Mainstream media.
[00:06:14.973 --> 00:06:16.854]  Government cover-ups.
[00:06:16.854 --> 00:06:18.555]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:06:18.555 --> 00:06:20.216]  Well, so does he.
[00:06:20.216 --> 00:06:24.918]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:53.463]  Thank you for joining us, my friends, on this Monday, February 10th, 2020 live transmission.
[00:06:53.463 --> 00:07:05.406]  I'll be here live for the next four hours, Lord willing, and I intend to open the phones up and I intend to take a lot of your phone calls and I intend to have some very informative guests on with us as well.
[00:07:12.932 --> 00:07:16.674]  The coronavirus has broken containment.
[00:07:16.674 --> 00:07:22.157]  It's spread all over the modern populated world.
[00:07:22.157 --> 00:07:28.300]  It's even showing up on Swiss Alp ski resort mountaintops.
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:37.925]  And it's the response to it by governments that's got everyone so concerned.
[00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:41.367]  Then you look at the providence of it, and it's clearly man-made, that gets you more concerned.
[00:07:42.517 --> 00:07:46.839]  The official number is over 900 dead confirmed cases exceeding 40,000.
[00:07:46.839 --> 00:07:53.121]  But we know they're covering up the real numbers of dead.
[00:07:53.121 --> 00:07:57.342]  China to quarantine city of Shenzhen.
[00:07:57.342 --> 00:08:04.065]  And of course the big news that has now been announced.
[00:08:04.065 --> 00:08:05.005]  China is now
[00:08:07.327 --> 00:08:14.993]  Locking down their capital city of Beijing.
[00:08:14.993 --> 00:08:19.157]  We're going to be looking at all of that today.
[00:08:19.157 --> 00:08:22.940]  This is a big deal.
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:33.148]  Immediately after Beijing quarantine, now Shanghai lockdown in response to shocking spread of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic.
[00:08:37.352 --> 00:08:41.534]  So we're going to be laying it all out here today.
[00:08:41.534 --> 00:08:44.915]  Quarantine centers set up at U.S.
[00:08:44.915 --> 00:08:47.136]  military bases, D.O.D.
[00:08:47.136 --> 00:08:49.357]  reports.
[00:08:49.357 --> 00:08:51.518]  Of course, we first laid all this out.
[00:08:51.518 --> 00:08:53.179]  This was going on a few weeks ago.
[00:08:53.179 --> 00:08:56.220]  The Pentagon was and already set it up.
[00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.001]  That was exclusively here at InfoWars.
[00:08:59.001 --> 00:09:01.422]  And now there it is in the Miami Herald yesterday.
[00:09:04.082 --> 00:09:05.182]  Meanwhile, the U.S.
[00:09:05.182 --> 00:09:09.664]  has charged four Chinese military members in Equifax breach.
[00:09:09.664 --> 00:09:20.326]  More and more Chinese spies are being charged in that ongoing struggle with Communist China.
[00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:29.749]  Mike Pompeo has come out in a speech to the Governor's Association, pointing out that bipartisanly, they are being targeted
[00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:33.796]  As well.
[00:09:33.796 --> 00:09:36.897]  We're going to be getting to that report.
[00:09:36.897 --> 00:09:41.399]  And we're going to talk about how serious could this virus really be?
[00:09:41.399 --> 00:09:43.500]  How big could it get?
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:57.365]  Because the response to it is the largest, most sustained response we've ever seen to a viral outbreak.
[00:09:58.874 --> 00:10:02.915]  So is it all a global government hysteria drill?
[00:10:02.915 --> 00:10:06.957]  Or is it something far worse?
[00:10:06.957 --> 00:10:18.540]  That is just some of what we're going to be laying out in those areas today.
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:25.663]  Also, Attorney General Barr takes on human trafficking in the child welfare system.
[00:10:26.618 --> 00:10:28.740]  That's one of the biggest places that it goes on.
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:32.303]  Not saying everybody involved in child welfare is bad.
[00:10:32.303 --> 00:10:34.445]  I'm not saying every social worker is bad.
[00:10:34.445 --> 00:10:38.869]  In fact, most of them are pretty good.
[00:10:38.869 --> 00:10:51.720]  But statistically, a lot of child trafficking gets covered up by the groups and organizations involved in it, like DynCorp that's been caught kidnapping children
[00:10:52.728 --> 00:11:06.672]  For sex slavery, this has been a congressional hearings reports confirmed all over the world and caught running many CPS operations in the United States.
[00:11:06.672 --> 00:11:10.773]  And the Attorney General has come out and spoken out about that.
[00:11:10.773 --> 00:11:20.096]  That is a big deal and a big plus for the Attorney General because they do not want that being discussed in the establishment.
[00:11:24.437 --> 00:11:27.079]  So this has happened over and over and over again.
[00:11:27.079 --> 00:11:36.965]  I also want to hit this when we come back in the second segment is the first story I want to burrow into in great detail.
[00:11:36.965 --> 00:11:40.427]  Charles Murray says we're living in post America.
[00:11:40.427 --> 00:11:49.053]  He says move to a small town to survive the collapse.
[00:11:49.053 --> 00:11:49.473]  And yes,
[00:11:52.069 --> 00:12:18.793]  If we don't turn America around and route the leftist poison ideology that is designed to collapse society, then the producers, whether you be white, black, Hispanic, old, young, but people that want to live like normal humans and want to live in what America was, if you don't want to live in the globalist paradigm that's actually taking us backwards,
[00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:30.632]  We're going to have to move to geographic areas and then pass laws and have culture and systems that do not tolerate the left because they don't tolerate us.
[00:12:30.632 --> 00:12:35.413]  They come in and take over and then end fair elections.
[00:12:35.413 --> 00:12:41.574]  You can pull up all the videos of the illegal aliens lined up in New York and other places being given their driver's license and being told to vote.
[00:12:41.574 --> 00:12:47.256]  They're not the enemy, but they're being used as a political weapon.
[00:12:47.256 --> 00:12:48.496]  We either defeat the left
[00:12:49.682 --> 00:12:55.309]  And absolutely repudiate them like we did communism, because that's what it is under another name.
[00:12:55.309 --> 00:13:00.235]  Or we die of it.
[00:13:00.235 --> 00:13:07.303]  Because the left engages in election fraud and is bringing in a permanent underclass that they control.
[00:13:08.599 --> 00:13:08.879]  I think?
[00:13:28.940 --> 00:13:34.021]  And it's homogeneous activities, and it's enslavement, and two million Muslims in death camps.
[00:13:34.021 --> 00:13:42.483]  But then in America, we can't even have a border or a wall, or say we're not gonna let Chinese fly in to the United States during this coronavirus outbreak.
[00:13:42.483 --> 00:13:48.044]  The UN says that's bad, but praises China mowing people down with machine guns.
[00:13:48.044 --> 00:13:52.525]  But because they're Asian, they cannot commit a crime.
[00:13:52.525 --> 00:13:55.086]  Only Caucasians
[00:13:56.471 --> 00:14:03.855]  are capable of any form of moral violations.
[00:14:03.855 --> 00:14:07.657]  And that's not a sarcastic statement.
[00:14:07.657 --> 00:14:13.781]  That's what the left has established and set up, and that's what they teach.
[00:14:13.781 --> 00:14:18.283]  And it's mainly white, globalist academics that are teaching it.
[00:14:18.283 --> 00:14:22.726]  But they are finding groups of non-whites who are now adopting
[00:14:25.666 --> 00:14:33.196]  The most racist inversion of common sense and what people like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:14:33.196 --> 00:14:33.997]  taught.
[00:14:33.997 --> 00:14:40.806]  It's just absolutely a betrayal of decency and the betrayal of America's
[00:14:42.415 --> 00:14:53.885]  Strengths that we wanted to be open and unify people under an American ideal and because we wanted to see people by the character of their deeds, not their color of their skin.
[00:14:53.885 --> 00:15:07.296]  The left has now used that against us and is engaged in classical race baiting and divide and conquer and are just an absolutely outrageously criminal group of people.
[00:15:07.296 --> 00:15:08.357]  But here's the good news.
[00:15:09.875 --> 00:15:11.757]  They're losing power all over the world.
[00:15:11.757 --> 00:15:15.460]  People are waking up and rejecting them because it's so obvious what they're doing.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:31.173]  And their corporate-controlled media, no matter how much censorship or control they try to bring against competition, is continuing to nosedive in viewership, and they are beyond irrelevant now.
[00:15:31.173 --> 00:15:36.677]  And so, we are about to witness some very interesting times ahead.
[00:15:37.659 --> 00:15:55.925]  But those that have bought into the ideology of the left, they are more enraged than ever because they were promised that they would be the power structure, that they would rule, that they were going to inherit the new America and be our jail guards overseeing us in the FEMA camps that Bernie Sanders' employees lust after.
[00:15:55.925 --> 00:15:57.926]  But of course it never ends up that way, does it?
[00:15:59.477 --> 00:16:02.920]  I'm here with Scott Youseum, founder of OMG Tax.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:07.784]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[00:16:07.784 --> 00:16:14.189]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garnishments sometimes in the same day.
[00:16:14.189 --> 00:16:19.573]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[00:16:19.653 --> 00:16:22.094]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[00:16:22.094 --> 00:16:23.514]  Oh, can I ever?
[00:16:23.514 --> 00:16:28.676]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[00:16:28.676 --> 00:16:29.436]  Guess what?
[00:16:29.436 --> 00:16:34.477]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[00:16:34.477 --> 00:16:44.760]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.
[00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:45.280]  Call 800-486-8112.
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:45.340]  800-486-8112.
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:45.400]  800-486-8112.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:45.740]  That's 800-486-8112.
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:55.902]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:17:10.165 --> 00:17:19.469]  Bill Hyde here, and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[00:17:19.469 --> 00:17:24.751]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[00:17:24.751 --> 00:17:36.957]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location, and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[00:17:36.957 --> 00:17:37.637]  So here's what you should do
[00:17:37.637 --> 00:17:37.977]  I think so.
[00:18:01.161 --> 00:18:05.865]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[00:20:03.426 --> 00:20:06.043]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:31.428 --> 00:20:36.252]  Well, Charles Murray is a respected individual.
[00:20:36.252 --> 00:20:44.959]  In fact, I've read his work for years, watched him on the show, but I'm not taking away from what he said, but it seems like saying that the sky's blue at high noon.
[00:20:44.959 --> 00:20:53.085]  Charles Murray, we're living in post-America, moved to a small town to survive the collapse.
[00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:55.507]  Well, it's not just that.
[00:20:55.507 --> 00:20:59.411]  If you want to be happier, if you want to be healthier, if you want to live longer and have more friends,
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:06.804]  Move to a small town and then get involved in micro agriculture.
[00:21:06.804 --> 00:21:16.130]  Doesn't even need to be for sale, but every study shows that farmers are more happy, they're more healthy.
[00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:26.017]  And the system is trying to make that obsolete and make it as hard as they can for you to not be able to be any level of self-sufficient.
[00:21:27.011 --> 00:21:41.486]  But the truth is that on five acres of decent soil, you can grow enough food for a hundred people.
[00:21:41.486 --> 00:21:49.995]  And so if you don't even know what you're doing, you can become self-sufficient in just a few years.
[00:21:51.069 --> 00:22:03.756]  But anybody can try to move out of the country, get a piece of land and get a local job and live at a subsistence level and be happier than a pig and you know what?
[00:22:03.756 --> 00:22:05.456]  We are designed to do it.
[00:22:05.456 --> 00:22:13.401]  And these modern cities and these modern systems are killing us.
[00:22:13.401 --> 00:22:17.703]  And you look at how under Obama and the federal government did everything they could to try to keep people
[00:22:18.971 --> 00:22:33.430]  From being able to even live in rural areas, Obama launched an initiative before he left saying that the rural areas are too white and too rural and that we need to modernize them by putting in federally funded
[00:22:34.349 --> 00:22:58.457]  Little 10-story buildings in the middle of each small town to then bring in the globalists, bring in the socialists, ship in some refugees, destabilize the town, cause some crime, have some infighting, get a bunch of people on welfare, and then bring in some homeless and some fentanyl so your teenager can overdose.
[00:23:00.609 --> 00:23:10.814]  You see, when you look at what the globalists are doing, it's to bring down civilization, it's to sabotage society, and it's in the WikiLeaks that that's what they're doing.
[00:23:10.814 --> 00:23:15.736]  The globalists can't rule over self-sufficient people.
[00:23:15.736 --> 00:23:27.502]  And the truth is, if you go out to rural areas anywhere, there are diverse groups of people living together in peace, in justice, and they know damn well what's going on, and they don't want any part of the big city.
[00:23:30.839 --> 00:23:37.284]  And if you ever move out of the country, you won't want to move back to the city, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:37.284 --> 00:23:40.045]  In fact, I haven't been to our family farm and ranch.
[00:23:40.045 --> 00:23:43.408]  I've been in the fight so hard in three years.
[00:23:43.408 --> 00:23:46.630]  We've got a big farm, big ranch in Texas.
[00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:49.712]  Beautiful, huge oak trees, cows, whole nine yards.
[00:23:49.712 --> 00:23:51.053]  My dad goes out there all the time.
[00:23:51.053 --> 00:23:52.134]  I'm just in the war.
[00:23:52.134 --> 00:23:54.095]  I just don't go there.
[00:23:54.095 --> 00:23:56.597]  Because if I went there, I might not come back.
[00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:01.113]  It looks like the Hobbit Shire or something.
[00:24:01.113 --> 00:24:08.399]  I mean some of the oak trees on our property are as big as the ones you'll see growing on the Colorado River in downtown Austin.
[00:24:08.399 --> 00:24:15.326]  You'll think that again Frodo Baggins is about to pop out from under one.
[00:24:15.326 --> 00:24:18.689]  And that's all over the United States and all over the world.
[00:24:18.689 --> 00:24:19.970]  And the establishment
[00:24:21.923 --> 00:24:29.948]  He's all leaving the big cities for many years, but they're building armored fortresses always on the backside of the hill where you don't see them.
[00:24:29.948 --> 00:24:38.313]  And helicopter pads that are concealed and redoubts.
[00:24:38.313 --> 00:24:39.333]  Why are they doing that?
[00:24:39.333 --> 00:24:44.636]  Because they have built a system that is designed to collapse.
[00:24:44.636 --> 00:24:46.798]  And I try to explain this to Bernie Sanders supporters.
[00:24:48.742 --> 00:25:07.435]  I try to explain to them, you know almost every major billionaire is a globalist or a leftist, because almost all of them made their money in the system that's fiat, and they've devalued the currency already 99.8% from what it was 107 years ago with the Federal Reserve Act.
[00:25:07.435 --> 00:25:14.801]  And so when you hear about Michael Bloomberg worth $76 billion, if Bloomberg tried to spend his $78 billion,
[00:25:16.769 --> 00:25:19.711]  The stock in his company would crash overnight.
[00:25:19.711 --> 00:25:24.474]  If Jeff Bezos tried to spend the 160-something million he's got, Amazon would crash.
[00:25:24.474 --> 00:25:28.836]  It's not real.
[00:25:28.836 --> 00:25:30.417]  They could never spend that money.
[00:25:30.417 --> 00:25:34.339]  They could never buy anything with it.
[00:25:34.339 --> 00:25:43.605]  Yeah, they've got 500-foot yachts and jet aircrafts and all this, but that's a tiny fraction of the wealth because it isn't real.
[00:25:44.551 --> 00:25:53.397]  When you hear that, oh, 1% have half the wealth, because it's all laundered, devalued garbage.
[00:25:53.397 --> 00:26:01.002]  You could go to Zimbabwe 10 years ago, and they had $50 billion notes.
[00:26:01.002 --> 00:26:08.026]  You couldn't buy a steak with a $50 billion note.
[00:26:08.026 --> 00:26:11.849]  You couldn't buy a suit with a wheelbarrow of them.
[00:26:12.867 --> 00:26:18.189]  In fact, you couldn't buy a suit anywhere in the country because it's a collapsed nation.
[00:26:18.189 --> 00:26:25.832]  Now, was the dictator of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe?
[00:26:25.832 --> 00:26:27.733]  Was he the richest man in the world?
[00:26:27.733 --> 00:26:33.115]  Because he had hundreds of trillions of dollars in his bank account.
[00:26:33.115 --> 00:26:37.437]  No, he wasn't.
[00:26:37.437 --> 00:26:42.359]  The only place that had any electricity was his palace.
[00:26:44.502 --> 00:26:52.547]  So I'm going to explain this again to folks.
[00:26:52.547 --> 00:26:55.329]  The United States has been robbed and devalued.
[00:26:56.468 --> 00:27:03.153]  People then say, well then why the hell is Trump continuing the devaluation?
[00:27:03.153 --> 00:27:05.995]  I've used this analogy a thousand times, I'll do it again.
[00:27:05.995 --> 00:27:11.980]  If you give a dog too many steroids, like a Labrador when it's old, it'll make it have a heart attack down the road.
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:16.404]  But if you don't give it the steroids, it'll never be able to get up, it's in so much pain, you gotta put it down.
[00:27:16.404 --> 00:27:23.229]  So you can keep a dog alive three, four, five years on steroids, and then one day they're finally gonna have a giant heart attack.
[00:27:23.229 --> 00:27:23.909]  And my dog did.
[00:27:26.567 --> 00:27:27.967]  I kept him alive.
[00:27:27.967 --> 00:27:30.208]  And that's the predicament Trump's in.
[00:27:30.208 --> 00:27:37.370]  He hopes he can grow us out of this with innovations and the secret technologies and things that they've suppressed, they call disruptive.
[00:27:37.370 --> 00:27:43.012]  And he's trying to get to the point of being able to release those, and he's doing it with drugs and a bunch of things.
[00:27:43.012 --> 00:27:50.594]  And he's let us become the number one exporter in the world in just a few years of natural gas and fossil fuels.
[00:27:50.594 --> 00:27:52.234]  That's a good thing as well.
[00:27:52.234 --> 00:27:54.195]  But Trump didn't build this mess.
[00:27:55.425 --> 00:27:58.347]  And for all the fiscal conservatives, I'm all about that.
[00:27:58.347 --> 00:28:00.029]  And I don't want to make people dependent.
[00:28:00.029 --> 00:28:01.410]  And I don't like where we're at.
[00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:02.331]  But you know what?
[00:28:02.331 --> 00:28:04.733]  We're there.
[00:28:04.733 --> 00:28:17.103]  And... We need to have a larger discussion about how sick this country is and how sick the West is.
[00:28:17.103 --> 00:28:23.628]  Not to put ourselves down, but to admit that we have to stop tolerating corruption and evil and the leftist agenda.
[00:28:26.069 --> 00:28:36.514]  That has sinking ship written all over it, and we have to decide and really have a larger discussion over the next few months with the listeners, because I'm making decisions.
[00:28:36.514 --> 00:28:40.196]  Should I do everything I do as if we're going to win and turn humanity around?
[00:28:40.196 --> 00:28:49.561]  Or should I make the whole broadcast about digging in, giving up on everybody else, and just trying to protect ourselves?
[00:28:49.561 --> 00:28:52.583]  Because I got to tell you, in the end, they're just going to dig us out of our holes.
[00:28:53.553 --> 00:28:54.974]  I really think I just said the answer there.
[00:28:54.974 --> 00:28:59.755]  We can't give up, but for a lot of us, for our children, we can run.
[00:28:59.755 --> 00:29:01.716]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:29:01.716 --> 00:29:08.619]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you, but the symptoms are there.
[00:29:08.619 --> 00:29:16.962]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[00:29:16.962 --> 00:29:22.644]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[00:29:22.824 --> 00:29:24.645]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[00:29:24.645 --> 00:29:26.806]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[00:29:26.806 --> 00:29:31.309]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[00:29:31.309 --> 00:29:33.510]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.

[00:30:02.847 --> 00:30:13.254]  Cobra Commander here reminding you to not own firearms, to not take supplements, to not get sunshine, and to not love Jesus.
[00:30:13.254 --> 00:30:21.779]  And of course, do not get storable foods or any other types of colloidal or nano-silver at InfoWarstore.com.
[00:30:21.779 --> 00:30:23.660]  Do not do it.
[00:30:23.660 --> 00:30:25.221]  Trust CNN.
[00:30:25.221 --> 00:30:27.223]  Trust MSNBC.
[00:30:27.223 --> 00:30:28.864]  Drink fluoridated water.
[00:30:29.404 --> 00:30:38.367]  Just like the loving kiss of a king cobra pumping deadly, I mean loving, helpful nutrients into your body.
[00:30:38.367 --> 00:30:40.147]  Hug the cobra.
[00:30:40.147 --> 00:30:41.928]  Love the cobra.
[00:30:41.928 --> 00:30:43.428]  Kiss the cobra.
[00:30:43.428 --> 00:30:51.171]  But never, never go to InfoWars.com or InfoWarsStore.com!
[00:30:51.171 --> 00:30:54.091]  Do not order those products!
[00:30:54.091 --> 00:30:56.092]  Silence Jones now!
[00:31:00.606 --> 00:31:03.848]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world.
[00:31:03.848 --> 00:31:06.230]  A lot of people that never deliver.
[00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:19.478]  Well, I'm here to tell you, InfoWars has delivered in royal flush, in a handful of ace of spades, because of God, because of the audience of activists, and because of the great team at InfoWars.
[00:31:19.478 --> 00:31:22.820]  And we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.723]  So right now, humanity is awakening, it's explosive, it's powerful, it's incredible.
[00:31:27.503 --> 00:31:36.852]  But there's major obstacles coming down the road, and the only way we can effectively fight the NWO and stay in the game on MFWC and Tip the Spear is your financial support.
[00:31:36.852 --> 00:31:39.754]  We make it really easy at MFWCstore.com.
[00:31:39.754 --> 00:31:43.458]  But I am blowing through our backup money right now.
[00:31:45.922 --> 00:31:46.863]  Well, let's see.
[00:32:01.162 --> 00:32:02.103]  The year 2020.
[00:32:02.103 --> 00:32:04.084]  World governments out in the open.
[00:32:04.084 --> 00:32:08.527]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer.
[00:32:08.527 --> 00:32:22.375]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[00:32:22.375 --> 00:32:22.575]  Wow!
[00:32:23.155 --> 00:32:24.636]  Yes, now we know we're right.
[00:32:24.636 --> 00:32:25.956]  The New World Order's real.
[00:32:25.956 --> 00:32:26.997]  Satanism's real.
[00:32:26.997 --> 00:32:28.358]  The pedophile elite are real.
[00:32:28.358 --> 00:32:32.180]  But we're real as well, and we love God, and we're standing up and saying no.
[00:32:32.180 --> 00:32:36.942]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in Kansas.
[00:32:36.942 --> 00:32:40.504]  We have never been in some Smallville place that didn't matter.
[00:32:40.504 --> 00:32:44.806]  Everything we do, every decision we make, governs the future of our species.
[00:32:45.106 --> 00:32:47.527]  And everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[00:32:47.527 --> 00:32:48.847]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[00:32:48.847 --> 00:32:51.808]  I'm going to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[00:32:51.808 --> 00:32:58.951]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support of mportshore.com is critical.
[00:32:58.951 --> 00:33:02.852]  So please take action.
[00:33:02.852 --> 00:33:05.493]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:14.284 --> 00:33:16.965]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:33:16.965 --> 00:33:22.267]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:33:22.267 --> 00:33:28.670]  I want you to think about something.
[00:33:28.670 --> 00:33:42.175]  When you turn on the news, or you watch a movie, or you see one of these drug ads, or any of it, if you pull back and think about it, you know the message they're giving you is destructive and designed to hurt you.
[00:33:49.758 --> 00:33:57.260]  What type of a system would want that?
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:02.821]  They're individuals hell-bent on sabotaging human development.
[00:34:02.821 --> 00:34:04.261]  They come to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:34:04.261 --> 00:34:05.841]  That's who they are.
[00:34:05.841 --> 00:34:16.323]  And once you understand that, you're not a victim who's just taking it because you don't know what's going on.
[00:34:16.323 --> 00:34:19.204]  Now you're aware of the war, and now
[00:34:21.465 --> 00:34:41.965]  When you work hard and take your children to school, and when you save extra money, and when you pray to God, and when you're successful, it's in spite of what they're doing, and you are literally a light in the dark of the night resisting them and are a leader.
[00:34:41.965 --> 00:34:45.369]  Just being aware of the enemy is half the battle.
[00:34:46.991 --> 00:34:50.214]  And then taking action is the rest of it.
[00:34:50.214 --> 00:34:51.695]  Because God will carry you the rest of the way.
[00:34:51.695 --> 00:34:56.499]  That's how it metaphysically works.
[00:34:56.499 --> 00:34:57.860]  And I'm stating basic truths.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:03.925]  Everybody knows this is the reality.
[00:35:03.925 --> 00:35:06.187]  But you think about those caught up in this evil.
[00:35:07.873 --> 00:35:11.734]  They believe if they just serve it, that they're going to be advanced.
[00:35:11.734 --> 00:35:15.754]  And that's why they're freaking out, because they've bet on the system.
[00:35:15.754 --> 00:35:17.755]  They've gone along with the system.
[00:35:17.755 --> 00:35:35.338]  And while America and the West and others were asleep for the last 50, 60 years, mesmerized by the television, put into a medical trance, literally, people that were part of the structure and in on the globalist program, and there's a lot of them, they thought, man, we are the rulers!
[00:35:35.338 --> 00:35:36.218]  This is amazing!
[00:35:37.819 --> 00:35:44.044]  No, you were the traitors against God.
[00:35:44.044 --> 00:35:47.706]  You were the garbage.
[00:35:47.706 --> 00:35:49.948]  And your time is coming to an end.
[00:35:49.948 --> 00:35:56.253]  Oh, you'll get your big world government and get your big world leader to worship for about a year or so.
[00:35:56.253 --> 00:36:03.498]  But as your world system completes itself, it will be collapsing.
[00:36:03.498 --> 00:36:06.120]  You're gonna force it, don't you worry.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:06.941]  You'll get your
[00:36:09.033 --> 00:36:16.135]  15 minutes of fame before your eternity of pain.
[00:36:16.135 --> 00:36:28.997]  You'll get to put your boot on our necks and heads and kick us around a little and feel big with your big daddy devil backing you up.
[00:36:28.997 --> 00:36:31.818]  But it's only there to test us, the faithful.
[00:36:31.818 --> 00:36:37.239]  You see, you're not gonna matter in eternity.
[00:36:38.246 --> 00:36:40.668]  You don't count.
[00:36:40.668 --> 00:36:43.869]  You decided to sell out to death.
[00:36:43.869 --> 00:36:46.211]  You decided to give in to evil.
[00:36:46.211 --> 00:36:48.672]  You failed the test.
[00:36:48.672 --> 00:36:55.336]  And that's why if you physically look at a globalist, they all look like they've had their souls sucked out because they have.
[00:36:55.336 --> 00:37:01.280]  They all look fantastically ridiculous because they are.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:05.843]  And if you have discernment, you go, what's wrong with these people?
[00:37:05.843 --> 00:37:07.644]  Why would they serve something like this?
[00:37:11.798 --> 00:37:21.707]  And it's because they never knew what hit them.
[00:37:21.707 --> 00:37:29.255]  Hitler invades Eastern Europe.
[00:37:29.255 --> 00:37:31.337]  Hungary, Romania, places like that.
[00:37:31.337 --> 00:37:32.658]  You got George Soros over there.
[00:37:32.658 --> 00:37:32.998]  He's 14 years old.
[00:37:40.691 --> 00:37:53.414]  And they say we need a bloodhound, we need a young Jew that'll go into these tenement areas and find where the hidden Jews are and get their property for us.
[00:37:53.414 --> 00:37:58.075]  And so for Soros, he goes on 60 Minutes and says he's proud of it.
[00:37:58.075 --> 00:38:01.355]  That's how you hide it in plain view, you see?
[00:38:01.355 --> 00:38:09.197]  But see, it didn't go over the way he thought, so now he tries to get that video banned everywhere, but... Soros never knew what hit him, did he?
[00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:15.171]  So let's put that picture of him now.
[00:38:15.171 --> 00:38:25.434]  He looks like a fly, an old fly that a spider sucked the juice out of.
[00:38:25.434 --> 00:38:34.276]  Just like that photo they showed of John D. Rockefeller, the founder of the Rockefeller family.
[00:38:34.276 --> 00:38:37.117]  You think serving evil is good?
[00:38:37.117 --> 00:38:38.938]  Yeah, put John D. Rockefeller back up there, guys.
[00:38:38.938 --> 00:38:39.538]  There you go.
[00:38:40.862 --> 00:38:44.805]  Think that old boy is feeling real good before he died?
[00:38:44.805 --> 00:38:46.247]  Think he's feeling Jesus?
[00:38:46.247 --> 00:38:47.708]  You think he's feeling scared?
[00:38:47.708 --> 00:39:06.724]  Because he's doing everything it told him to, and just like Faust at the end, he knows, oh boy, I screwed up bad.
[00:39:06.724 --> 00:39:09.226]  There's nobody more scared than these devil worshipers.
[00:39:11.186 --> 00:39:13.587]  That's why they're always trying to scare us.
[00:39:13.587 --> 00:39:15.929]  Because see, they're the slaves.
[00:39:15.929 --> 00:39:18.370]  They're the fly that got caught in the spider's web.
[00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:21.772]  They're not the spider.
[00:39:21.772 --> 00:39:24.514]  But the spider's not much more spectacular than them.
[00:39:24.514 --> 00:39:33.699]  In Revelation, when Satan is imprisoned for a thousand years, they'll come and look at him and say, that conquered us?
[00:39:39.548 --> 00:39:43.689]  Because you've got that spiritual body, you'll be able to see how big your soul is.
[00:39:43.689 --> 00:39:47.630]  You'll be able to see how powerful you are next to God, nothing.
[00:39:47.630 --> 00:39:53.772]  And then you'll look at Satan and say, that tricked us?
[00:39:53.772 --> 00:39:59.334]  That almost won?
[00:39:59.334 --> 00:40:02.195]  But only because we were not conscious of it.
[00:40:03.994 --> 00:40:10.143]  I'm going to get into the latest on the virus and I'm going to get into everything that's happening in society, but I think I have the answer.
[00:40:10.143 --> 00:40:11.966]  I think you'll agree with me.
[00:40:11.966 --> 00:40:20.238]  If you have children, you have a duty to go to rural Christian areas and to raise them outside of the big cities and the suburbs.
[00:40:22.338 --> 00:40:30.102]  It's not running to go to those places, but you have to be politically involved and fight for the rest of the nation and against the globalists while you're there.
[00:40:30.102 --> 00:40:40.528]  But you need to run with your children to the most conservative, Christian, nationalist, patriot area you can.
[00:40:40.528 --> 00:40:45.131]  And then you need to work overtime to try to save the republic itself, because if that fails,
[00:40:46.081 --> 00:40:47.201]  And so it's not just a right, it's a duty.
[00:40:47.201 --> 00:40:48.822]  And as soon as I can, I am moving out of Austin.
[00:40:48.822 --> 00:40:50.903]  You know, my mom's from here, my family's from here.
[00:41:16.304 --> 00:41:17.085]  I don't know.
[00:41:32.771 --> 00:41:36.673]  My children to a safer distance away from Sodom and Gomorrah.
[00:41:36.673 --> 00:41:44.578]  And then when the future tells me then a lot of the time because we have to put our money where our mouths are.
[00:41:44.578 --> 00:41:50.742]  And it really is time to evacuate every major blue city crap hole.
[00:41:50.742 --> 00:41:54.304]  And some will argue, well, you're just you're just seeding them the victory.
[00:41:54.304 --> 00:41:56.045]  No, they need us.
[00:41:58.906 --> 00:42:06.555]  And you've got to get religious about not spending your money with the establishment or with any leftist institutions.
[00:42:06.555 --> 00:42:10.539]  You have to take the blood supply, the oxygen supply away from them.
[00:42:10.539 --> 00:42:20.030]  And I'm talking to myself when I say this, and you have to totally, as much as you can, cut yourself off from the system and only invest in that that is promoting freedom and justice.
[00:42:21.428 --> 00:42:24.109]  Because they're trying to shut everybody down that doesn't serve them.
[00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:25.950]  They're trying to take the NRA's banking away.
[00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:27.130]  They're trying to take our banking away.
[00:42:27.130 --> 00:42:32.313]  They want to force us into their world government system with their Chinese social score.
[00:42:32.313 --> 00:42:41.317]  And so we have to more and more become self-sufficient to say no to that because we know it's not coming, it's here.
[00:42:41.317 --> 00:42:43.397]  Mark of the Beast, world government, it's all happening.
[00:42:43.397 --> 00:42:45.919]  So I'll finish up with these clips that I mentioned about
[00:42:48.298 --> 00:43:02.382]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.
[00:43:02.382 --> 00:43:06.963]  No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, we're all feeling the strain from rising pressure.

[00:44:00.819 --> 00:44:04.542]  It's Friday evening when I'm cutting this one-minute unscripted ad.
[00:44:04.542 --> 00:44:06.384]  I'm just telling you what's going on, straight shoot.

[00:44:14.691 --> 00:44:17.233]  Now, we've almost sold out of the 1-ouncers.
[00:44:17.233 --> 00:44:20.116]  We've got 3 ounces for the next week and a half at current sales rates.
[00:44:20.496 --> 00:44:28.702]  This is just great to have regardless and it's really good for you and it targets bacteria and viruses across the board and it funds the InfoWar.

[00:45:05.221 --> 00:45:07.341]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[00:45:07.341 --> 00:45:09.822]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[00:45:09.822 --> 00:45:23.285]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself you will see how amazing it is and then your support of the product we're selling will help you
[00:45:23.925 --> 00:45:24.025]  Yes.
[00:45:40.387 --> 00:45:45.371]  Eight years ago, I started taking True Iodine, Atomic Iodine.
[00:45:45.371 --> 00:45:53.058]  We've got it back in stock, X2, 40% off right now at InfoWareStore.com, and I'm telling you folks, get it.
[00:45:53.058 --> 00:45:54.239]  It's amazing.

[00:45:57.822 --> 00:45:59.224]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[00:46:01.519 --> 00:46:03.862]  The demand for food has not let up.
[00:46:03.862 --> 00:46:06.266]  We are selling record amounts of it.
[00:46:06.266 --> 00:46:10.992]  Everybody else is basically already sold out, or they have a giant wait list.
[00:46:10.992 --> 00:46:12.815]  Our suppliers have it in-house.
[00:46:12.815 --> 00:46:16.920]  It's taken 7 to 10 days to deliver because, again, they have to package it.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:17.702]  They're running 24 hours a day.
[00:46:18.943 --> 00:46:23.405]  But in a few days, they're telling me it may go to a longer wait if you haven't gotten your order in.
[00:46:23.405 --> 00:46:24.886]  So I wouldn't procrastinate.
[00:46:24.886 --> 00:46:26.927]  We wanted this virus to be petering out.
[00:46:26.927 --> 00:46:28.448]  We wanted it to just be hype.
[00:46:28.448 --> 00:46:31.550]  Looks like it is really, really bad and is man-made.
[00:46:31.550 --> 00:46:34.111]  And so that's why we're seeing the huge freakout.
[00:46:34.111 --> 00:46:37.433]  So get your storable food at InfoWarsofStore.com.
[00:46:37.433 --> 00:46:38.553]  That helps fund our operation.

[00:46:39.914 --> 00:46:41.375]  A total $3.60 win.
[00:46:41.375 --> 00:46:43.116]  Again, get your food and actually get it delivered.
[00:46:43.696 --> 00:46:46.198]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:33.063 --> 00:47:44.330]  Communist China has now locked down two more of their biggest cities, including Beijing, their capital city.
[00:47:44.330 --> 00:47:44.470]  U.S.
[00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:48.893]  military setting up quarantine centers across the United States.
[00:47:48.893 --> 00:47:49.033]  U.S.
[00:47:49.033 --> 00:47:55.777]  military bases, AP, Reuters, and Miami Herald are all reporting more.
[00:47:55.777 --> 00:48:00.260]  Communist Chinese cities are now being announced to be under total lockdown and quarantine, like Shanghai.
[00:48:03.001 --> 00:48:04.942]  Clearly the virus is spreading quickly.
[00:48:04.942 --> 00:48:06.723]  It is deadly.
[00:48:06.723 --> 00:48:09.084]  But China's also not letting a good crisis go to waste.
[00:48:09.084 --> 00:48:10.605]  They're using it as a political crackdown.
[00:48:10.605 --> 00:48:11.225]  That's confirmed.
[00:48:11.225 --> 00:48:15.767]  Targeting Christians, Buddhists and others.
[00:48:15.767 --> 00:48:18.449]  And they're also now eyeing Hong Kong.
[00:48:18.449 --> 00:48:30.354]  And that's certainly shut down democracy demonstrations and free speech demonstrations and anti-police state demonstrations there.
[00:48:30.354 --> 00:48:31.435]  I want to open the phones up.
[00:48:32.654 --> 00:48:42.161]  For first-time callers, on any subject you want to discuss, but obviously most of you are going to want to talk, I would imagine, about coronavirus and what you really think is going on behind it.
[00:48:42.161 --> 00:48:48.025]  We can also discuss, is America done?
[00:48:48.025 --> 00:48:52.789]  Sure, we can put off the total collapse for a while, but the societal rot is so massive.
[00:48:52.789 --> 00:48:53.990]  Are we in a post-America?
[00:48:53.990 --> 00:48:59.114]  Did we just move to a small town and hope it all passes over us?
[00:49:01.035 --> 00:49:08.340]  Well, quality life's better in a small town if you can take care of yourself and your family in one.
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:09.360]  People are certainly nicer.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:14.544]  The 5G globalist scourges aren't there, the homeless and the gangs aren't there.
[00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:21.052]  But how do you then keep the borders from being totally collapsed by the UN?
[00:49:21.052 --> 00:49:30.998]  Because the globalists know if they get rid of the republic, if they get rid of the idea of a wealthy middle class, if they get rid of the idea of America, the whole world's going to fall to complete tyranny.
[00:49:30.998 --> 00:49:33.120]  And that's their invented plan.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:35.101]  The average leftist says they hate America.
[00:49:35.101 --> 00:49:41.945]  Their ethos, their operating system, who they are, their identity, is hating their own country.
[00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:46.828]  Even though most millennials don't even have a passport and can't find their ass with both hands.
[00:49:49.795 --> 00:49:53.158]  Living in post-America, move to small town, survive.
[00:49:53.158 --> 00:50:14.056]  Infowars.com, conservative scholar, Charles Murray, gave a delightfully black-pilled interview recently, where he talked about America's decline, and why ordinary folks should consider moving to small-town America, which is much more easily open now than it has ever been before, and in many cases still just as Alexis de Tocqueville described in the 1830s.
[00:50:16.820 --> 00:50:19.683]  Do what I did, which is live in traditional America.
[00:50:19.683 --> 00:50:22.405]  And that's open.
[00:50:22.405 --> 00:50:25.387]  And that's much more easily open now than it ever was before.
[00:50:25.387 --> 00:50:28.610]  Murray said, Life Cites Jonathan Van Maren.
[00:50:28.610 --> 00:50:32.674]  Last month, I write books calling on hundreds of technical sources.
[00:50:32.674 --> 00:50:35.736]  No problem sitting out there in a small town in Maryland.
[00:50:35.736 --> 00:50:36.297]  He continued.
[00:50:39.522 --> 00:50:59.575]  Yeah, but he's not an expert on how to move to the small town, and I'll tell you who is, is Bill Skousen, who I've invited to fly here, and it's time to call Savannah, your producing today, and say, first class, he's got his own private jet, he flies around, he's a pilot himself, come here, do his presentation, he's a leading expert on strategic relocation and where you should move and what you should do.
[00:50:59.575 --> 00:51:01.537]  We sell the big book, I made the film with him.
[00:51:02.097 --> 00:51:07.220]  They're exclusively available, the film, as well as the book, at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:51:07.220 --> 00:51:12.223]  You can get it from his site as well, but the films at InfowarsStore.com exclusively, but both are excellent.
[00:51:12.223 --> 00:51:23.750]  I didn't mean to go off into a plug for strategic relocation, but it's incredible the research he's done on the safest, best, most sustainable places in the United States to move.
[00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:28.133]  Let's go ahead and play a clip from that podcast with Charles Murray we were just talking about.
[00:51:30.049 --> 00:51:32.932]  What would collapse look like in your view?
[00:51:32.932 --> 00:51:34.273]  Collapse?
[00:51:34.273 --> 00:51:38.577]  Yes.
[00:51:38.577 --> 00:51:48.685]  Well, if you're talking about the American experiment, it already has.
[00:51:48.685 --> 00:51:55.532]  In practice, there are still large swaths of the country which are living a very traditional American life.
[00:51:55.532 --> 00:51:56.172]  I'm in one of them.
[00:51:56.172 --> 00:51:56.953]  I'm in a small town.
[00:51:57.975 --> 00:51:59.556]  In Maryland.
[00:51:59.556 --> 00:52:02.118]  Last week, our post office and a house burned down.
[00:52:02.118 --> 00:52:03.820]  A house with four apartments.
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:12.767]  And I won't go through all the things that the community immediately did, but they were all the classic things of taking care of neighbors, of making things right.
[00:52:12.767 --> 00:52:15.168]  And I don't live in an atypical small town.
[00:52:15.168 --> 00:52:17.350]  Small towns all over the country are like that.
[00:52:17.350 --> 00:52:18.831]  Okay.
[00:52:18.831 --> 00:52:23.255]  But as far as any constitutional limits on the authority of the government,
[00:52:24.202 --> 00:52:30.807]  Uh, the idea of the, of the federal government as the founder saw, that's, that's, that is a doornail.
[00:52:30.807 --> 00:52:35.490]  I don't care how many Supreme Court justices we, we get like Gorsuch and so forth.
[00:52:35.490 --> 00:52:48.139]  There are certain things where you can't roll back the clock because to do so would require declaring that about 97% of what the federal government does is unconstitutional and that ain't going to happen.
[00:52:48.139 --> 00:52:51.822]  Um, so I think America is showing what, uh, post
[00:52:53.917 --> 00:52:56.378]  I think it's going to be great.
[00:53:21.772 --> 00:53:37.921]  But the sense of the American way of life, which was something that was in common use, a phrase that was in common use until 50 years ago, will be meaningless, or already is meaningless.
[00:53:41.525 --> 00:53:50.291]  Except, I knew that we could get a president elected, and I knew we could take the Republican Party over, and I knew we could see nationalists and populists get elected all over the place.
[00:53:50.291 --> 00:54:02.200]  In just the last five years, we've seen Brexit fought through and won, we've seen Trump elected, we've seen the globalists in deep trouble, the chi-coms now on their knees for being the age of the dragon, and we're all done.
[00:54:06.291 --> 00:54:22.746]  But if the listeners, the vanguard of the resistance, if you run for office, if you get aggressive, if you go get in people's faces, if you go tell the pedophile rings they're not going to have drag queen story time at your schools, they're getting cancelled by the way all over the world, if you tell colleges and academics
[00:54:24.761 --> 00:54:27.802]  I'm not going to support you if you don't stop this brainwashing.
[00:54:27.802 --> 00:54:36.105]  If you start using your political and spiritual and financial and cultural muscle, there's nothing you can't do.
[00:54:36.105 --> 00:54:46.188]  But yeah, if everybody just wants to hide out in their small town and watch everything fall apart and not engage in leadership, you're damn right, the American dream's completely over.
[00:54:46.188 --> 00:54:47.889]  But I want to explain something.
[00:54:47.889 --> 00:54:49.529]  There's nowhere to hide.
[00:54:49.529 --> 00:54:52.090]  There's nowhere to run.
[00:54:52.090 --> 00:54:53.751]  And America was never perfect.
[00:54:55.151 --> 00:55:03.720]  It's always had problems, and Hollywood is collapsing, and its societal rot has gone too far, and people are peeking out.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.182]  They're done with it.
[00:55:05.182 --> 00:55:11.509]  So if we just create art and culture and literature that's wholesome and good, and if we stand up and promote freedom,
[00:55:12.688 --> 00:55:15.310]  People are going to come to us.
[00:55:15.310 --> 00:55:18.131]  That's why big tech wants to censor everybody now.
[00:55:18.131 --> 00:55:20.132]  That's why they want to block all voices.
[00:55:20.132 --> 00:55:22.854]  Because they can't compete with the truth we're putting out.
[00:55:22.854 --> 00:55:28.377]  And they're there to bite us like a cobra and poison us so they can dominate us and control us.
[00:55:28.377 --> 00:55:34.701]  Because a good, upwardly mobile, connected to God group of people won't go along with the plan they're selling.
[00:55:34.701 --> 00:55:36.842]  Because the plan they're selling sucks!
[00:55:39.941 --> 00:55:44.443]  I think we can beat a plan that stinks, that nobody really wants.
[00:55:44.443 --> 00:55:53.146]  They may get a bunch of people with two or three college degrees that bought into it and are totally unhappy and want to force us to go along with it because they've been promised positions in it.
[00:55:53.146 --> 00:56:01.790]  They may get a bunch of those losers to be mad at us and they'll all give them TV shows and put them up there and force feed them to us, but nobody's buying what they're saying.
[00:56:03.632 --> 00:56:07.673]  The coolest thing out there for a decade running is hating Hollywood.
[00:56:07.673 --> 00:56:10.274]  And now it's gone from being cool to a religion.
[00:56:24.073 --> 00:56:27.275]  Thomas Jefferson talked about, but did he miss the main part?
[00:56:27.275 --> 00:56:39.943]  That the American spirit was about pissing on someone just given power because of who their family was, or someone being arrogant, or someone dressed up all fancy, festooned with a bunch of stuff trying to impress people.
[00:56:39.943 --> 00:56:41.944]  Americans rejected that.
[00:56:43.134 --> 00:56:56.147]  They wanted real and rugged and strong and truthful and somebody that was committed to doing what they said they'd do because that's the type of people you want to build a world with.
[00:56:56.147 --> 00:56:57.729]  It's the type of woman you want.
[00:56:57.729 --> 00:56:59.190]  It's the type of man you want.
[00:56:59.190 --> 00:57:00.651]  It's the type of children you want.
[00:57:00.651 --> 00:57:02.213]  It's the type of town you want.
[00:57:02.213 --> 00:57:03.594]  It's the type of people you want.
[00:57:04.415 --> 00:57:24.738]  And everybody knows everybody wanted to get here, not because we had Hollywood and drag queen story time and all of the freaked out fashion shows and, you know, bananas taped to the wall, $100,000 joke art shows to invert reality, but because it was a place where you had a chance to be yourself and be rugged and pull it all on the table and roll the dice.
[00:57:25.962 --> 00:57:41.449]  I'll take the real Wall-Wall West that's America over their whole globalist nanny state BS system any day and I'll bet on you every time because I know you've got what it takes and you really want reality.
[00:57:41.449 --> 00:57:43.090]  And we've tested it.
[00:57:43.090 --> 00:57:48.673]  We've already won fantastically and our greatest days are ahead with our massive challenges.
[00:57:49.409 --> 00:57:53.430]  Almost all the other big storable food companies are sold out of food.
[00:57:53.430 --> 00:57:58.951]  But I know for a fact from sources to telling people, oh, we've got it, get your order in, two weeks for delivery.
[00:57:58.951 --> 00:58:00.791]  We follow this pattern over and over again.
[00:58:00.791 --> 00:58:02.452]  I've been on radio for 25 years.
[00:58:02.452 --> 00:58:04.612]  I've had storable food for a long time.
[00:58:04.612 --> 00:58:13.054]  And I learned very quickly, a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times, but during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory, they'll still take your orders.
[00:58:13.294 --> 00:58:28.321]  That's why about 11 years ago I found MyPatriotSupply, now the biggest, most trusted company out there and I became a private labeler for them because they actually have it on hand, they actually give it delivered to you on time, they do what they're going to say they're going to do because they want you as a customer over and over again and they're good people.
[00:58:28.321 --> 00:58:33.224]  Now they were saying 7 to 10 days before shipping because they've got the food but they've got to package it, record level orders.
[00:58:33.524 --> 00:58:38.290]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[00:58:38.290 --> 00:58:40.272]  So get your orders in at MFulWarsaw.com.
[00:58:40.272 --> 00:58:41.273]  Get the best deals.

[00:58:44.217 --> 00:58:45.599]  Then it funds the M4 as well.
[00:58:45.599 --> 00:58:46.500]  So get prepared.

[00:58:50.583 --> 00:58:54.185]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[00:58:54.185 --> 00:58:55.966]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[00:58:55.966 --> 00:59:07.232]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[00:59:08.012 --> 00:59:17.197]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[00:59:17.197 --> 00:59:23.121]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research.
[00:59:23.121 --> 00:59:28.244]  A fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[00:59:28.244 --> 00:59:30.505]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[00:59:30.865 --> 00:59:32.586]  It is not an antihistamine.
[00:59:32.586 --> 00:59:42.569]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[00:59:42.569 --> 00:59:45.230]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[00:59:45.230 --> 00:59:53.393]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[00:59:53.393 --> 00:59:56.094]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:07.927 --> 01:00:10.429]  Alright, I'm going to give the number out.
[01:00:10.429 --> 01:00:13.150]  Next segment, start taking your phone calls.
[01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:16.532]  And I'm going to hit all this other news I haven't gotten to yet on this live Monday edition.
[01:00:16.532 --> 01:00:18.033]  I'm very honored to be here and to be your host.
[01:00:18.033 --> 01:00:21.175]  The only reason I'm on air is because of you and we love you and we appreciate you.
[01:00:21.175 --> 01:00:25.738]  I want to play this important report.
[01:00:25.738 --> 01:00:29.941]  The dawn of race-specific bio-warfare is upon us.
[01:00:29.941 --> 01:00:31.262]  This bio-attack
[01:00:32.555 --> 01:00:41.778]  Is race specific targeting specifically Chinese military age males.
[01:00:41.778 --> 01:00:47.500]  And that almost all the people infected and almost all of those dying are males.
[01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.681]  That's hidden in the literature.
[01:00:49.681 --> 01:00:51.521]  The medical reports.
[01:00:51.521 --> 01:00:59.044]  And then you get the scan by the major Indian scientific gene splicing university.
[01:00:59.044 --> 01:01:00.084]  And it's conclusive!
[01:01:01.957 --> 01:01:14.069]  And now other groups have looked at it and said, yeah, it's even got the insertion gene that you see with RNA and gene editing where it was injected.
[01:01:16.380 --> 01:01:19.524]  There's signatures right there.
[01:01:19.524 --> 01:01:22.247]  So I'm not going to give the U.S.
[01:01:22.247 --> 01:01:34.120]  government a pass and say for sure that somebody in the deep state on the American team isn't pissed at enough fentanyl being shipped in every couple months to kill the entire world population.
[01:01:34.821 --> 01:01:37.042]  You're like, that's what shipped into the U.S.?
[01:01:37.042 --> 01:01:38.023]  Yes.
[01:01:38.023 --> 01:01:39.164]  Enough to kill the whole world.
[01:01:50.185 --> 01:01:54.367]  That's why you see homeless everywhere laying out, asleep during the day, asleep at night.
[01:01:54.367 --> 01:01:56.769]  They're not asleep, they're passed out on fentanyl.
[01:01:56.769 --> 01:02:12.718]  But you pull back from this, and you think about what's going on in China, they need an excuse to clamp down on their political enemies, a way to unify the population under control, a way to get the world to endorse their tyranny, something Trump's suddenly done that's wrong.
[01:02:12.718 --> 01:02:15.900]  You're like, oh, they would never kill millions of their own military-aged men.
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:16.881]  It's called a balance.
[01:02:19.284 --> 01:02:24.966]  I did fall pregnant for a second time, Jiang Xinping tells me, but I had an abortion.
[01:02:24.966 --> 01:02:29.627]  Did you have a choice?
[01:02:29.627 --> 01:02:31.848]  I couldn't keep it, she replies.
[01:02:31.848 --> 01:02:35.869]  You either go willingly, or the government comes for you.
[01:02:35.869 --> 01:02:37.609]  That's what the Chai comms talk about.
[01:02:37.609 --> 01:02:39.050]  One child policy.
[01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:40.490]  This is even from Wikipedia.
[01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.791]  I don't just believe Wikipedia, it links through to all the government sources.
[01:02:44.189 --> 01:02:52.272]  According to Chinese government, 400 million births have been prevented and tens of millions have been killed after they're born.
[01:02:52.272 --> 01:02:56.233]  China's sex ratio is out of whack.
[01:02:56.233 --> 01:02:58.994]  117.7 boys to every 100 girls.
[01:02:58.994 --> 01:03:02.536]  That means higher crime rates and fewer eligible brides.
[01:03:02.536 --> 01:03:05.757]  So if they'll kill 400 million people, mainly girls...
[01:03:06.877 --> 01:03:11.903]  Will they release a race-specific bioweapon only targeting military-age men?
[01:03:11.903 --> 01:03:14.265]  Yes, because they've done the demographics.
[01:03:14.265 --> 01:03:25.177]  And they've got an internal problem because there's hundreds of millions of more men than women, and they can't find women.
[01:03:25.177 --> 01:03:27.220]  So see, first they took the girls away from you.
[01:03:28.632 --> 01:03:34.836]  And they let you get up to 30 years old or whatever, let you extinguish some of your energy, and now they're just gonna kill you.
[01:03:34.836 --> 01:03:38.819]  The evidence mounts, this is a race-specific bioweapon, well we know it's that.
[01:03:38.819 --> 01:03:46.944]  The evidence mounts that the Chi-Coms launched this against themselves to save face about their economic collapse, their lost war with the US.
[01:03:47.885 --> 01:03:50.347]  And as a way to clamp down and control their population.
[01:03:50.347 --> 01:03:54.990]  I remember my grandfather going, they want us to have a nuclear war.
[01:03:54.990 --> 01:04:00.634]  The Chinese dictator, whoever it was after Mao died, says he wants us to nuke them because they want to get rid of their population.
[01:04:00.634 --> 01:04:02.875]  They're the only group in the world that wants to get rid of them.
[01:04:02.875 --> 01:04:06.698]  That's why they fit into this world government scheme to reduce the population.
[01:04:06.698 --> 01:04:11.121]  And I'm telling you, they'll release a race-specific weapon and blame it on us.
[01:04:11.121 --> 01:04:12.062]  That's the plan!
[01:04:15.106 --> 01:04:18.209]  Don't act so surprised, Globalist.
[01:04:18.209 --> 01:04:22.013]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[01:04:22.013 --> 01:04:25.957]  Join Bandot Video, and I will complete your training.
[01:04:25.957 --> 01:04:30.361]  Together, we can overthrow the Emperor and restore the Republic.
[01:04:30.361 --> 01:04:35.567]  Alright.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:44.449]  Lock yourselves in, ladies and gentlemen, because we're gonna get the number out when we come back and hit all the big breaking news straight ahead.
[01:04:44.449 --> 01:04:49.235]  On the other side, I am your host, Alex Jones, and this is the InfoWar.
[01:04:49.235 --> 01:04:52.979]  This is the pro-human transmission.
[01:04:52.979 --> 01:04:54.741]  This is the resistance.
[01:04:58.427 --> 01:05:04.021]  We've got three big sales going right now, and one of them has to end within a week.
[01:05:04.021 --> 01:05:05.966]  And that's Ultimate Fish Oil 4.
[01:05:08.268 --> 01:05:09.629]  33% off.
[01:05:09.629 --> 01:05:10.450]  It's amazing.
[01:05:10.450 --> 01:05:12.010]  Go check it out for yourself.
[01:05:12.010 --> 01:05:20.455]  Then we've got back in stock X2, our best-selling Deep Earth Crystals Iodine, the good halogen that is the building block to everything in the body.
[01:05:20.455 --> 01:05:22.656]  And I just can't tell you enough how important it is.
[01:05:22.656 --> 01:05:27.539]  The UN admits 2 billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never got enough iodine.
[01:05:27.539 --> 01:05:29.160]  So just check it out for yourself.
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:30.361]  40% off.
[01:05:30.361 --> 01:05:32.662]  MFullworkstore.com and it funds the MFullwork.
[01:05:32.662 --> 01:05:33.863]  And then Vitamin
[01:05:34.443 --> 01:05:37.305]  D3 with vitamin K that fuses it together.
[01:05:37.305 --> 01:05:38.546]  Super high quality.
[01:05:38.546 --> 01:05:39.607]  Winter sun.
[01:05:39.607 --> 01:05:41.428]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[01:05:41.428 --> 01:05:44.050]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[01:05:44.050 --> 01:05:45.331]  That's why people get so sick.
[01:05:45.331 --> 01:05:46.131]  That's the main reason.
[01:05:46.131 --> 01:05:48.373]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue.
[01:05:48.373 --> 01:05:49.234]  Get higher absorption.
[01:05:49.234 --> 01:05:50.114]  It's amazing.
[01:05:50.114 --> 01:05:54.878]  All three of these are on sale, but only for a limited time at InfowarStore.com.
[01:05:54.878 --> 01:05:56.799]  Protect yourself and fund the Infowar.
[01:05:56.799 --> 01:05:56.919]  360WIN.
[01:06:15.808 --> 01:06:17.949]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:06:17.949 --> 01:06:18.570]  to 3 p.m.
[01:06:18.570 --> 01:06:21.672]  Central, I am here live, right after the David Knight Show.
[01:06:21.672 --> 01:06:23.553]  8 a.m.
[01:06:23.553 --> 01:06:24.513]  to 11 a.m.
[01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:32.418]  after I end my transmission, Owen Schroer and when she's co-hosting, Savannah Hernandez take over.
[01:06:32.418 --> 01:06:33.278]  We're in full force.
[01:06:33.278 --> 01:06:38.762]  We file a lot of live reports, a lot of special reports, and we're demonized and lied about.
[01:06:39.687 --> 01:06:59.071]  Let them control corporate media because they are a bunch of puppets that follow their orders and they can't stand the existence of real individuals that aren't always right but are trying to tell the truth and that are independent and that are captains of their own ship.
[01:06:59.071 --> 01:07:02.311]  So here we are in defiance of their tyranny.
[01:07:02.311 --> 01:07:05.292]  I want to open the phones up for the balance of the broadcast.
[01:07:07.887 --> 01:07:15.789]  On any topic you want to discuss, any issue you want to break down, obviously the coronavirus outbreak is getting out of control.
[01:07:15.789 --> 01:07:20.750]  They've locked down Beijing, the capital of China, and other major cities.
[01:07:20.750 --> 01:07:30.233]  Now they're announcing, and the footage coming out of people being mass arrested and put into small dog kennel-like cubes, begging for their lives.
[01:07:31.957 --> 01:07:35.498]  And right after Beijing was quarantined, now Shanghai's been locked down.
[01:07:35.498 --> 01:07:41.580]  This is definitely being used by the Chai Koms as a political power grab as well, with the UN praising their action.
[01:07:41.580 --> 01:07:45.262]  But again, the US blocks planes from China.
[01:07:45.262 --> 01:07:45.942]  We're racist.
[01:07:45.942 --> 01:07:47.242]  The UN said that as well.
[01:07:47.242 --> 01:07:50.103]  That's just oxymoronic.
[01:07:50.103 --> 01:07:55.005]  They don't criticize Russia stopping flights two weeks ago and closing their border a week and a half ago.
[01:07:55.005 --> 01:07:55.885]  Oh no, that's wonderful.
[01:07:55.885 --> 01:07:56.506]  Or other people.
[01:07:56.506 --> 01:07:59.447]  No, no, it's us!
[01:07:59.447 --> 01:07:59.987]  It's us!
[01:08:04.437 --> 01:08:06.199]  We're the bad guys.
[01:08:06.199 --> 01:08:08.861]  China says don't be on the streets.
[01:08:08.861 --> 01:08:09.782]  Where are they going to get food?
[01:08:09.782 --> 01:08:11.784]  Where are they going to get?
[01:08:11.784 --> 01:08:14.366]  But think about this, what happens when the food and stuff runs out?
[01:08:14.366 --> 01:08:19.510]  The virus incubates, what, eight to ten days, and you can get it again after you've had it.
[01:08:19.510 --> 01:08:24.895]  Can we put up on screen the official UN death toll and kind of show that map for TV viewers?
[01:08:24.895 --> 01:08:31.441]  Because we know it's definitely way higher than they're saying, but is the response overblown?
[01:08:33.792 --> 01:08:34.032]  U.S.
[01:08:34.032 --> 01:08:36.654]  government setting up quarantine centers here in the United States?
[01:08:36.654 --> 01:08:36.995]  U.S.
[01:08:36.995 --> 01:08:38.696]  military?
[01:08:38.696 --> 01:08:39.837]  We told you that two weeks ago.
[01:08:39.837 --> 01:08:43.780]  Didn't want to scare folks, but they were thinking it was going to be big and it was already being set up.
[01:08:43.780 --> 01:08:45.241]  Here it is, all confirmed.
[01:08:45.241 --> 01:08:47.743]  Miami Herald.
[01:08:47.743 --> 01:08:48.924]  Toll-free number to join us is 877-789-2539.
[01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:49.144]  877-789-Alex.
[01:08:49.144 --> 01:08:49.324]  Or 877-789-2539.
[01:08:49.324 --> 01:08:52.987]  And if you're in China and you can get through the line, you'll go to the front of the line.
[01:09:02.185 --> 01:09:02.585]  877-789-2539.
[01:09:02.585 --> 01:09:08.330]  And guys, put on screen for me the international line.
[01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:09.071]  Dial the U.S.
[01:09:09.071 --> 01:09:12.994]  country code and 512-646-1776.
[01:09:12.994 --> 01:09:13.815]  512-646-1776.
[01:09:13.815 --> 01:09:26.205]  In other news, Pompeo sounds alarm over China attempt to suppress free speech.
[01:09:26.205 --> 01:09:26.465]  U.S.
[01:09:26.465 --> 01:09:29.308]  charges four Chinese military members in Equifax breach.
[01:09:33.615 --> 01:09:37.416]  That's just some of the news on that front.
[01:09:37.416 --> 01:09:41.158]  Attorney General Barr takes on human trafficking and child welfare system.
[01:09:41.158 --> 01:09:44.059]  There's video up on nationalfile.com and infowars.com.
[01:09:44.059 --> 01:09:45.559]  We'll be covering that.
[01:09:45.559 --> 01:09:54.022]  They're calling it fake video where people take Pelosi tearing up Trump's speech and then add it to things and repeat it over and over again.
[01:09:54.022 --> 01:09:56.223]  No, it's called a meme.
[01:09:56.223 --> 01:10:01.745]  But when photographers edit video of Trump looking insane, that's okay.
[01:10:01.745 --> 01:10:02.365]  That's not fake.
[01:10:03.558 --> 01:10:10.908]  But when it isn't fake, well, it's got to be gotten rid of.
[01:10:10.908 --> 01:10:13.251]  So all of that is coming up.
[01:10:13.251 --> 01:10:17.757]  But they're now announcing AI is going to be watching everything you post and do.
[01:10:17.757 --> 01:10:19.860]  And if they decide
[01:10:23.490 --> 01:10:25.871]  That it's edited, you can't have it.
[01:10:25.871 --> 01:10:29.233]  So they're telling the general public, you can't edit video.
[01:10:29.233 --> 01:10:31.834]  So you notice a year and a half ago, it's Van Alex Jones.
[01:10:31.834 --> 01:10:35.155]  A year and a half later, it's, oh, you can't edit video and put it on the internet.
[01:10:35.155 --> 01:10:40.978]  Any edited video, zooming it in, slowing it down, repeating something, you're not allowed.
[01:10:40.978 --> 01:10:43.619]  We call that fake news.
[01:10:43.619 --> 01:10:50.062]  That's why old PolitiFact and people fact check comics now.
[01:10:50.062 --> 01:10:51.323]  They fact check memes because
[01:10:52.452 --> 01:11:02.159]  They're waging war on just human interaction and saying, oh, you're trying to deceive somebody.
[01:11:02.159 --> 01:11:05.262]  We're not doing any such thing.
[01:11:05.262 --> 01:11:10.926]  This is what's done over and over and over again by these people.
[01:11:12.617 --> 01:11:23.560]  Okay, we're going to go to break in a few minutes, come back, go to all of your phone calls, but I did want to spend some time on something that really gives you an idea of how bad this coronavirus really is.
[01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:34.304]  I told you two weeks ago that almost all the other major food distributors were actually sold out of food and trying to now buy up more food.
[01:11:35.114 --> 01:12:00.948]  But that our big sponsor that we've had for over 10 years, My Patriot Supply, had plenty of food on hand, but they were honest that there was a 7 to 10 day wait because they had to package it running 24 hours a day, three or four times the biggest volume of ordering that they've ever seen, with Homeland Security and with FEMA and with the Office of Personnel, all of them trying to call and buy up whatever food they had for their quarantine centers around the United States.
[01:12:02.298 --> 01:12:03.378]  Remember that was two weeks ago.
[01:12:03.378 --> 01:12:09.960]  I told you they're setting up quarantine centers and they want emergency backup food for folks inside quarantine centers.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:10.860]  And the U.S.
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:14.761]  government already has huge stockpiles of storable food, so why would they be wanting even more?
[01:12:14.761 --> 01:12:21.523]  Because a lot of it's 20, 30 years old and the government employees want good stuff and they know MyPatriot's good, but they're buying up everything already.
[01:12:22.489 --> 01:12:25.030]  Now, a lot of these other companies, I don't have them as sponsors.
[01:12:25.030 --> 01:12:27.071]  I could have six, seven food sponsors right now.
[01:12:27.071 --> 01:12:35.954]  I don't, because I learned early on, if there's not a big rush, and there's nothing going on, they got the food, and you know, it's okay.
[01:12:35.954 --> 01:12:42.797]  But when there's a problem, no, they'll take your order, but they won't ship it out to you for a few months, until they finally get the money, and then make the food, and put it all together.
[01:12:44.121 --> 01:12:48.544]  When you order at InfoWorksShore.com, you get the lowest price on the full catalog of My Patriot Supply.
[01:12:48.544 --> 01:12:51.025]  It funds our operation, and they're in our back end.
[01:12:51.025 --> 01:12:52.186]  They get the orders.
[01:12:52.186 --> 01:12:59.731]  It's, boom, goes right into queue with them, and you get it just as fast as anybody else that orders from them.
[01:12:59.731 --> 01:13:02.292]  And it supports the operation.
[01:13:02.292 --> 01:13:04.974]  And now it's 10 to 14 days.
[01:13:04.974 --> 01:13:06.455]  They're right at about 10 days right now.
[01:13:06.455 --> 01:13:09.657]  I just wanted to say 10 to 14, because the orders aren't going down.
[01:13:09.657 --> 01:13:10.658]  They're intensifying.
[01:13:12.932 --> 01:13:15.133]  Because folks know this is really serious now.
[01:13:15.133 --> 01:13:23.756]  But for 2020, for economic issues down the road, for inflation, for a possible depression, for any reason, this is insurance you can eat.
[01:13:23.756 --> 01:13:26.537]  This is stuff that you can save and know that you're always going to use.
[01:13:26.537 --> 01:13:29.278]  If you don't use your car insurance or your medical, well, it's money lost.
[01:13:29.278 --> 01:13:33.360]  But with this, it tastes as good as 10 years as it does today.
[01:13:34.818 --> 01:13:39.362]  A lot of this food is indistinguishable from gourmet-type stuff you get at the store.
[01:13:39.362 --> 01:13:40.823]  Some of it tastes okay.
[01:13:40.823 --> 01:13:44.306]  But for the price, you're getting the best high-quality stuff there is out there.
[01:13:44.306 --> 01:13:45.768]  Nobody can come close.
[01:13:45.768 --> 01:13:51.253]  They're cheaper than all the major competitors, and they want to be so that you come back to them over and over again.
[01:13:51.253 --> 01:13:54.215]  They're now the biggest storable food company in the United States.
[01:13:54.215 --> 01:13:58.179]  They have the great Alexa Pure filtration.
[01:13:58.179 --> 01:13:59.139]  You see it's top-rated.
[01:13:59.139 --> 01:14:01.702]  Their air filter's top-rated, but half the price of competitors.
[01:14:02.222 --> 01:14:14.608]  They have the same philosophy as I do, so I want to go out and get one sponsor, one supplier that's just good year after year, that you get a great response from, that I use, and that you get quality products from.
[01:14:14.608 --> 01:14:25.834]  And so, it's there, it's available right now, and I would advise everybody, if you've been on the fence about a four-week supply, about a three-month supply, about a six-month supply, about a year's supply,
[01:14:27.267 --> 01:14:30.710]  This is something that everybody that can, should have.
[01:14:30.710 --> 01:14:35.455]  And it's in these great high-quality plastic tote containers that are sealed.
[01:14:35.455 --> 01:14:38.578]  Then it's got sealed packaging inside of that.
[01:14:38.578 --> 01:14:40.339]  It's absolutely filled to the brim.
[01:14:40.339 --> 01:14:42.622]  You're not paying for air here, folks.
[01:14:42.622 --> 01:14:44.623]  This is the best bang for your buck out there.
[01:14:44.623 --> 01:14:48.127]  That's why they are our supplier.
[01:14:48.127 --> 01:14:49.028]  So don't wait anymore.
[01:14:49.028 --> 01:14:50.749]  Go to infowarestore.com.
[01:14:50.749 --> 01:14:52.050]  Get your order in today.
[01:14:52.791 --> 01:14:56.713]  And know that you will be at the front of the line to get it as quickly as possible.
[01:14:56.713 --> 01:14:58.974]  You get it in, it's guaranteed 10 to 14 days.
[01:14:58.974 --> 01:15:00.575]  They have the food.
[01:15:00.575 --> 01:15:05.898]  It's just that they've got to package it and it is crazy, the volume.
[01:15:05.898 --> 01:15:07.399]  Almost no one else has any food.
[01:15:07.399 --> 01:15:07.959]  Do they tell you?
[01:15:07.959 --> 01:15:08.619]  They do.
[01:15:08.619 --> 01:15:13.602]  They're lying to you or you're going to get 20-year-old C-rations, in my experience.
[01:15:13.602 --> 01:15:15.483]  It just does not exist out there.
[01:15:16.503 --> 01:15:22.408]  And I was there two weeks ago, and they were saying, should we spend everything we get coming in to order more food for other folks?
[01:15:22.408 --> 01:15:23.408]  Do you think this is how bad?
[01:15:23.408 --> 01:15:25.670]  I said, yeah, no, I think your gut level's right.
[01:15:25.670 --> 01:15:26.571]  I said, go all in.
[01:15:26.571 --> 01:15:32.475]  I think, unfortunately, you know, in a month, you'll be selling more food than you are now, because I think this is pretty serious.
[01:15:32.475 --> 01:15:33.916]  The response we're seeing is really serious.
[01:15:33.916 --> 01:15:35.757]  And regardless, 2020 is a crazy year.
[01:15:35.757 --> 01:15:36.418]  People need to be prepared.
[01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:40.723]  And so they've purchased a ton more food, and it's all coming in, all getting ready.
[01:15:40.723 --> 01:15:45.128]  But you order now, you're ordering food they have in stock that you will get.
[01:15:45.128 --> 01:15:47.911]  But I would not wait any more than what's going on.
[01:15:47.911 --> 01:15:50.474]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:15:50.474 --> 01:15:54.479]  They have a lot of specialty meals, you name it.
[01:15:54.479 --> 01:15:55.300]  Amazing food.

[01:17:23.823 --> 01:17:25.625]  Not a security IPO or note.

[01:17:48.283 --> 01:17:51.871]  Equipment offered poses a financial risk.
[01:17:51.871 --> 01:17:53.875]  Owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[01:17:53.875 --> 01:17:56.401]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[01:17:59.059 --> 01:18:01.500]  The demand for food has not let up.
[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:03.921]  We are selling record amounts of it.
[01:18:03.921 --> 01:18:08.642]  Everybody else is basically already sold out, or they have giant wait lists.
[01:18:08.642 --> 01:18:10.443]  Our suppliers have it in-house.
[01:18:10.443 --> 01:18:14.565]  It's taken 7 to 10 days to deliver because, again, they have to package it.
[01:18:14.565 --> 01:18:16.585]  They're running 24 hours a day.
[01:18:16.585 --> 01:18:20.927]  But in a few days, they're telling me it may go to a longer wait if you haven't gotten your order in.
[01:18:21.427 --> 01:18:22.548]  So I wouldn't procrastinate.
[01:18:22.548 --> 01:18:24.590]  We wanted this virus to be petering out.
[01:18:24.590 --> 01:18:26.091]  We wanted it to just be hype.
[01:18:26.091 --> 01:18:29.213]  Looks like it is really, really bad and is man-made.
[01:18:29.213 --> 01:18:31.795]  And so that's why we're seeing the huge freakout.
[01:18:31.795 --> 01:18:34.457]  So get your storable food at InfoWarshipStore.com.

[01:18:46.362 --> 01:18:49.083]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:18:49.083 --> 01:18:50.883]  And regardless, it funds the operation.
[01:18:50.883 --> 01:18:53.064]  We also have the immune gargle at 40% off.
[01:18:53.064 --> 01:18:56.085]  We are going to sell out of that, but I'm just keeping it at that sales price.
[01:18:56.085 --> 01:18:57.225]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:18:57.805 --> 01:18:58.586]  Well, it's here.
[01:18:58.586 --> 01:18:59.526]  The year 2020.
[01:18:59.526 --> 01:19:01.507]  World governments out in the open.
[01:19:01.507 --> 01:19:05.950]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer.
[01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:19.798]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[01:19:19.798 --> 01:19:19.978]  Wow!
[01:19:20.578 --> 01:19:22.059]  Yes, now we know we're right.
[01:19:22.059 --> 01:19:23.379]  The New World Order's real.
[01:19:23.379 --> 01:19:24.420]  Satanism's real.
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:25.781]  The pedophile elite are real.
[01:19:25.781 --> 01:19:29.603]  But we're real as well, and we love God, and we're standing up and saying no.
[01:19:29.603 --> 01:19:34.365]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in Kansas.
[01:19:34.365 --> 01:19:37.927]  We have never been in some Smallville place that didn't matter.
[01:19:37.927 --> 01:19:42.229]  Everything we do, every decision we make, governs the future of our species.
[01:19:42.529 --> 01:19:44.890]  And everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[01:19:44.890 --> 01:19:46.271]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[01:19:46.271 --> 01:19:49.232]  I'm going to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[01:19:49.232 --> 01:19:56.376]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support of mportshore.com is critical.
[01:19:56.376 --> 01:20:01.438]  So please take action.
[01:20:01.438 --> 01:20:04.060]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:18.282 --> 01:20:19.423]  Big Brother.
[01:20:19.423 --> 01:20:21.225]  Mainstream media.
[01:20:21.225 --> 01:20:23.107]  Government cover-ups.
[01:20:23.107 --> 01:20:24.809]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:20:24.809 --> 01:20:26.590]  Well, so does he.
[01:20:26.590 --> 01:20:32.857]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:37.591 --> 01:20:41.392]  You know, I was thinking this morning when I woke up.
[01:20:41.392 --> 01:20:50.136]  The Democrats have been very, very silent since Trump was acquitted in the Senate last week.
[01:20:50.136 --> 01:20:54.237]  In fact, right after it happened, there was almost no coverage on CNN.
[01:20:54.237 --> 01:20:56.578]  It was just like a footnote.
[01:20:56.578 --> 01:21:01.520]  And now they're just calling him the impeached president and they've moved on to other stories.
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:05.542]  So as soon as the Russia gate fell apart, they kind of shut up about that for a while, moved on to Ukraine.
[01:21:07.421 --> 01:21:14.664]  What scandal are they going to cook up next to try to get the President on the defensive so he can't get his policies through?
[01:21:14.664 --> 01:21:20.087]  Is it going to be a woman saying he raped them?
[01:21:20.087 --> 01:21:26.730]  Is it going to be there's a tape of the President saying the N-word?
[01:21:26.730 --> 01:21:29.071]  Who knows what they're going to pull or what they're going to do.
[01:21:29.071 --> 01:21:33.753]  Just more fake garbage, more lies, more disinformation.
[01:21:33.753 --> 01:21:36.995]  But that's just a question to all the listeners.
[01:21:38.530 --> 01:21:43.855]  Bill and Greg and Hayden and Presley and Levi and Smig and Chris and Debbie and CJ.
[01:21:43.855 --> 01:21:51.543]  They're calling about different topics and I want to hear from you, but I'm just simply asking.
[01:21:51.543 --> 01:21:54.586]  They're deathly quiet right now.
[01:21:54.586 --> 01:21:59.071]  They don't have a new allegation anymore.
[01:21:59.071 --> 01:22:00.272]  What is it going to be?
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:10.603]  I mean, their talking point has been that he wasn't exonerated and that he wasn't found not guilty, even though he was.
[01:22:10.603 --> 01:22:15.925]  Now, acquitted, found not guilty, not guilty means guilty now.
[01:22:15.925 --> 01:22:18.687]  Or not guilty means, well, you're still guilty.
[01:22:18.687 --> 01:22:19.927]  And 2 plus 2 equals 5,000.
[01:22:19.927 --> 01:22:22.408]  And the Easter Bunny's real, and so is Santa Claus.
[01:22:22.408 --> 01:22:25.010]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[01:22:25.010 --> 01:22:29.632]  But we should all be asking, what's the next big fiasco gonna be?
[01:22:32.386 --> 01:22:35.027]  You go, but it'll make Democrats look like fools to have a new impeachment.
[01:22:35.027 --> 01:22:38.228]  They've said they are going to do it, probably before the election!
[01:22:38.228 --> 01:22:46.552]  With 266 days left, and the fiasco in Iowa, and them trying to steal it from Bernie Sanders again.
[01:22:46.552 --> 01:22:49.373]  But doesn't that scare the hell out of you?
[01:22:49.373 --> 01:22:53.495]  The Democratic Party wants a dyed-in-the-wool communist.
[01:22:56.667 --> 01:23:01.330]  That actually said, there's too many choices at the grocery store.
[01:23:01.330 --> 01:23:03.372]  I've played the video before.
[01:23:03.372 --> 01:23:10.257]  There's video of him saying, there are too many choices at the grocery store.
[01:23:10.257 --> 01:23:12.078]  There's too much.
[01:23:12.078 --> 01:23:13.159]  We need lines.
[01:23:24.653 --> 01:23:26.114]  We've tried communism everywhere.
[01:23:26.114 --> 01:23:26.894]  It's a disaster.
[01:23:26.894 --> 01:23:34.217]  But we've got a big crop of millennials that have been promised they're going to be commanders in it.
[01:23:34.217 --> 01:23:36.517]  Why, there's a place for them running things.
[01:23:36.517 --> 01:23:40.959]  They can't run their own lives, but they're going to run ours.
[01:23:40.959 --> 01:23:41.779]  Don't you worry.
[01:23:41.779 --> 01:23:45.781]  They're going to start right off at the top.
[01:23:45.781 --> 01:23:46.601]  There it is.
[01:23:46.601 --> 01:23:54.044]  We don't need 23 choices of deodorant, 18 choices of sneakers when kids are going hungry.
[01:23:56.257 --> 01:23:59.279]  Doesn't he know that more choice means more?
[01:23:59.279 --> 01:24:03.102]  And that people in the West go hungry less than anyone else?
[01:24:03.102 --> 01:24:12.750]  And his model of Venezuela has over 1,500 people a week starving to death?
[01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:15.052]  It does not matter.
[01:24:15.052 --> 01:24:17.754]  He has bozo hair.
[01:24:17.754 --> 01:24:23.859]  And when you have bozo hair, you know best.
[01:24:23.859 --> 01:24:25.100]  All right, I'm gonna stop it right now.
[01:24:26.434 --> 01:24:35.276]  Craig, Hayden, Presley, Levi, Schmig, Chris, Debbie, CJ.
[01:24:35.276 --> 01:24:41.217]  Who should we talk to first?
[01:24:41.217 --> 01:24:43.238]  Let's talk to Presley in North Carolina.
[01:24:43.238 --> 01:24:44.098]  Presley, you're on the air.
[01:24:44.098 --> 01:24:45.878]  Welcome.
[01:24:45.878 --> 01:24:46.578]  Hey, Alex.
[01:24:46.578 --> 01:24:47.678]  Great to talk to you.
[01:24:47.678 --> 01:24:48.519]  God bless you.
[01:24:48.519 --> 01:24:50.019]  Always praying for you and the country.
[01:24:51.561 --> 01:24:56.063]  I've been listening to you since I found you on Sacred Count and E-Bombs World, man, about 20 years ago.
[01:24:56.063 --> 01:24:57.743]  That's how long I've been listening to you.
[01:24:57.743 --> 01:25:00.564]  Wow, you've been putting up with me for a while, brother.
[01:25:00.564 --> 01:25:03.586]  Yeah, man, when you used to hang out with Rogan and Stan Ho.
[01:25:03.586 --> 01:25:06.107]  Turned my brother on to you too, so.
[01:25:06.107 --> 01:25:10.988]  I just wanted to bring up how it's funny that the protests for freedom in Hong Kong stopped because of the virus.
[01:25:10.988 --> 01:25:14.490]  I wonder if that was somehow a part of it.
[01:25:14.490 --> 01:25:15.010]  Say that again?
[01:25:16.121 --> 01:25:21.025]  How the protests for freedom, democracy and freedom in Hong Kong stopped because of this virus.
[01:25:21.025 --> 01:25:22.126]  Oh, yeah.
[01:25:22.126 --> 01:25:26.971]  They've definitely used it as a way to clamp down rebellion all over China.
[01:25:26.971 --> 01:25:29.533]  China lost the economic war with us.
[01:25:29.533 --> 01:25:30.874]  Their economy's falling apart.
[01:25:30.874 --> 01:25:32.656]  Then they have negative growth all of a sudden.
[01:25:32.656 --> 01:25:36.439]  And this is a perfect face-saving reset for China.
[01:25:36.439 --> 01:25:37.240]  I totally agree with you.
[01:25:38.462 --> 01:25:47.667]  Yeah, and just also my other point is just people are so sick of the crap coming out of Hollywood that a foreign film won Best Picture and Best Foreign Film and Best Director last night.
[01:25:49.930 --> 01:25:51.070]  Absolutely.
[01:25:51.070 --> 01:25:53.091]  People just hate Hollywood.
[01:25:53.091 --> 01:25:55.952]  Clearly China's using this for power and control.
[01:25:55.952 --> 01:25:59.873]  We're going to find out the death rates of all these people that have contracted.
[01:25:59.873 --> 01:26:00.933]  It certainly spreads fast.
[01:26:00.933 --> 01:26:01.693]  That's confirmed now.
[01:26:01.693 --> 01:26:06.675]  We're going to find out on these cruise ships with 60 sick here, 50 sick here, 200 sick there.
[01:26:06.675 --> 01:26:09.616]  We're going to find out real quick the morbidity rate.
[01:26:09.616 --> 01:26:11.276]  And I hope it's super low.
[01:26:11.276 --> 01:26:12.377]  In fact, I hope it's zero.
[01:26:12.377 --> 01:26:13.497]  What are you predicting it's going to be?
[01:26:15.445 --> 01:26:26.812]  Um, I'm hoping it's going to be low, but like my brother told me, I don't know where he got this from the thought of it, but he said, just remember don't pop any bubble wrap because all that air comes from China.
[01:26:26.812 --> 01:26:29.574]  Another good point, because this virus lives a long time.
[01:26:29.574 --> 01:26:38.619]  What do you think of Joaquin Phoenix knowing the only way for him to be popular is to say Hollywood sucks, we're all parasites?
[01:26:38.619 --> 01:26:43.002]  Um, he's just a loser and hopefully they finally shut him up by finally giving him an Oscar.
[01:26:43.905 --> 01:26:45.265]  He got one, yeah.
[01:26:45.265 --> 01:26:50.087]  But I mean, just think about how even he gets, I suck, I apologize.
[01:26:50.087 --> 01:26:51.907]  By the way, we're all scum, we're all parasites.
[01:26:51.907 --> 01:26:53.228]  I haven't played the clip yet.
[01:26:53.228 --> 01:26:54.948]  It's like, yeah, exactly.
[01:26:54.948 --> 01:26:58.129]  The only way he knows people will watch him is to say, I know you hate me.
[01:26:58.129 --> 01:26:59.109]  Exactly.
[01:26:59.109 --> 01:27:02.430]  He does that little, you know, fake, delicate genius act.
[01:27:02.430 --> 01:27:08.812]  Big, any moron could... Yeah, and he's always leaning on the sympathy of his brother, you know.
[01:27:09.244 --> 01:27:17.130]  Let me just, listen, anybody could sit there and put on the Delicate Genius Autistic Act.
[01:27:17.130 --> 01:27:19.252]  Maybe I'll host a whole hour as Joaquin Phoenix.
[01:27:19.252 --> 01:27:22.374]  I mean, he does one acting event.
[01:27:22.374 --> 01:27:26.257]  Oh man, I'd love to see you in the Joker makeup again, dude.
[01:27:26.257 --> 01:27:28.819]  I'd love to get in a ring with Joaquin Phoenix with baseball bats.
[01:27:28.819 --> 01:27:29.479]  That's what I'd like.
[01:27:29.479 --> 01:27:31.681]  I'll show his ass the Joker for real.
[01:27:31.681 --> 01:27:33.943]  I'll show him the Joker for real.
[01:27:36.374 --> 01:27:37.235]  God bless you, Alex.
[01:27:37.235 --> 01:27:38.257]  Keep up the good fight, man.
[01:27:38.257 --> 01:27:39.579]  Alright, God bless you, brother.
[01:27:39.579 --> 01:27:40.440]  I appreciate you calling.
[01:27:40.440 --> 01:27:41.481]  Sorry, I shouldn't talk like that.
[01:27:41.481 --> 01:27:42.503]  Excuse me, Lord.
[01:27:42.503 --> 01:27:43.324]  Jesus, please help me.
[01:27:48.103 --> 01:27:52.364]  That whole movie is about causing riots and death and killing police.
[01:27:52.364 --> 01:27:55.846]  That's why all the cops just got shot in New York in the last few days.
[01:27:55.846 --> 01:28:00.047]  And we just got two more cops shot just now in a Walmart in Arkansas.
[01:28:00.047 --> 01:28:03.368]  And that whole movie is about an uprising starting in the trains.
[01:28:03.368 --> 01:28:09.150]  And leftist groups funded by Soros have been trying to take the trains over and have riots that end up bringing down New York.
[01:28:09.710 --> 01:28:11.851]  With that Communist Mayor de Blasio behind it.
[01:28:11.851 --> 01:28:14.871]  I mean, these people are disgusting jokes.
[01:28:14.871 --> 01:28:16.252]  Does it mean the cops are perfect?
[01:28:16.252 --> 01:28:17.212]  No, they're just like us.
[01:28:17.212 --> 01:28:20.713]  They got problems, they got good things about them, bad things.
[01:28:20.713 --> 01:28:27.455]  But the foreign multinational powers are trying to foment a race war and the takedown of local government.
[01:28:28.439 --> 01:28:30.540]  So the communists can come in and take over.
[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:32.380]  And I got news for you.
[01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:38.162]  Bunch of you jokers want to run around and really get a war started and start killing people and civilization breaks down.
[01:28:38.162 --> 01:28:41.042]  You're going to wish there were police, believe me.
[01:28:41.042 --> 01:28:45.383]  Because there are a lot of people who don't want to be violent, who've been trying to fix things.
[01:28:45.383 --> 01:28:53.306]  But believe me, if there's ever a civil war and breakdown and anarchy, you leftists are in a world of you know what?
[01:28:53.306 --> 01:28:54.586]  You people are a joke!
[01:28:57.915 --> 01:29:02.977]  Fellow Patriots, my name is Todd Savage, founder of BlackRifleRealEstate.com.

[01:29:58.368 --> 01:30:02.412]  Almost all the other big storable food companies are sold out of food.
[01:30:02.412 --> 01:30:07.917]  But I know for a fact from sources, they're telling people, oh, we've got it, get your order in, two weeks for delivery.
[01:30:07.917 --> 01:30:09.759]  We follow this pattern over and over again.
[01:30:09.759 --> 01:30:11.080]  I've been on radio for 25 years.
[01:30:11.080 --> 01:30:13.602]  I've had storable food for a long time.
[01:30:13.602 --> 01:30:22.050]  And I learned very quickly, a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times, but during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory, they'll still take your orders.
[01:30:22.250 --> 01:30:37.300]  That's why about 11 years ago, I found MyPatriotSupply, now the biggest, most trusted company out there, and I became a private labeler for them, because they actually have it on hand, they actually give it delivered to you on time, they do what they're going to say they're going to do, because they want you as a customer over and over again, and they're good people.
[01:30:37.300 --> 01:30:42.183]  Now, they were saying 7 to 10 days before shipping, because they've got the food, but they've got to package it record-level orders.
[01:30:42.483 --> 01:30:47.248]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[01:30:47.248 --> 01:30:49.231]  So get your orders in at InfoWarsaw.com.
[01:30:49.231 --> 01:30:50.252]  Get the best deals.

[01:30:52.174 --> 01:30:53.195]  It goes right to them.
[01:30:53.195 --> 01:30:54.577]  Then it funds the Infor as well.
[01:30:54.577 --> 01:30:55.318]  So get prepared.
[01:30:55.318 --> 01:30:57.260]  InfoWarsaw.com with Sorible Foods.
[01:31:00.939 --> 01:31:11.385]  Cobra Commander here reminding you to not own firearms, to not take supplements, to not get sunshine, and to not love Jesus.
[01:31:11.385 --> 01:31:19.869]  And of course, do not get storable foods or any other types of colloidal nanosilver at InfoWarstore.com.
[01:31:19.869 --> 01:31:21.770]  Do not do it.
[01:31:21.770 --> 01:31:23.331]  Trust CNN.
[01:31:23.331 --> 01:31:25.312]  Trust MSNBC.
[01:31:25.312 --> 01:31:26.993]  Drink fluoridated water.
[01:31:27.493 --> 01:31:36.497]  Just like the loving kiss of a king cobra pumping deadly, I mean loving, healthful nutrients into your body.
[01:31:36.497 --> 01:31:38.238]  Hug the cobra.
[01:31:38.238 --> 01:31:40.018]  Love the cobra.
[01:31:40.018 --> 01:31:41.539]  Kiss the cobra.
[01:31:41.539 --> 01:31:49.282]  But never, never go to InfoWars.com or InfoWarsStore.com!
[01:31:49.282 --> 01:31:51.763]  Do not order those products!
[01:31:51.763 --> 01:31:53.744]  Silence Jones!
[01:31:58.663 --> 01:32:02.807]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers of InfoWars.
[01:32:02.807 --> 01:32:13.198]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana as a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S., but worldwide.
[01:32:13.198 --> 01:32:20.025]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[01:32:20.706 --> 01:32:30.483]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that and some other areas, but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[01:32:30.483 --> 01:32:33.168]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever.
[01:32:34.022 --> 01:32:39.186]  We really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[01:32:39.186 --> 01:32:44.129]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[01:32:44.129 --> 01:32:46.511]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[01:32:46.511 --> 01:32:52.295]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[01:32:52.295 --> 01:32:54.297]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[01:32:54.297 --> 01:32:57.379]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[01:33:01.411 --> 01:33:04.096]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:19.449 --> 01:33:24.854]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:24.854 --> 01:33:25.815]  I sure did.
[01:33:25.815 --> 01:33:27.436]  I got no friends.
[01:33:27.436 --> 01:33:30.299]  Cause they read the papers.
[01:33:45.447 --> 01:33:48.908]  See, back then though, if the newspapers were attacking you, you must be bad.
[01:33:48.908 --> 01:33:57.371]  But now the newspapers attack you, you must be good!
[01:33:57.371 --> 01:34:01.292]  Actually, I am super nice now.
[01:34:02.996 --> 01:34:07.840]  So good to be attacked by a bunch of lying scum and the pedophile networks.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:12.663]  Because the thinking people see right through it and have stood with us.
[01:34:12.663 --> 01:34:20.249]  And I'm just so proud of the people, not just the United States, but of the world that are throwing off the globalists right now.
[01:34:20.249 --> 01:34:27.454]  And it's just going to get even more amazing in the future.
[01:34:27.454 --> 01:34:30.917]  I got no friends because they read the papers with me.
[01:34:32.668 --> 01:34:34.690]  Okay, we're gonna go back to your phone calls.
[01:34:34.690 --> 01:34:38.454]  We're getting serious here.
[01:34:38.454 --> 01:34:44.179]  You see how an authoritarian regime, like the Communist Chinese, the worst in history, on record?
[01:34:44.179 --> 01:34:48.183]  Highest kill rates, the most oppressive, you name it.
[01:34:48.183 --> 01:34:51.406]  400 million babies aborted, tens of millions after they're born.
[01:34:53.715 --> 01:34:56.237]  You see how they're using this to clamp down on control.
[01:34:56.237 --> 01:35:12.393]  And of all the macabre science fiction nightmare dystopia videos we've seen of people being shot at checkpoints and people being put in containment pods, there's a new video up on InfoWars.com.
[01:35:12.393 --> 01:35:13.234]  China!
[01:35:13.234 --> 01:35:18.279]  Woman falls to her death trying to escape coronavirus quarantine.
[01:35:24.332 --> 01:35:38.359]  That's just absolutely hideous and so sad, where they've boarded up, they've welded shut the buildings, and now this woman wants out, may run out of food, run out of medication, who knows?
[01:35:38.359 --> 01:35:48.705]  And she's up there trying to climb, but loses her grip, didn't mean to die, and she falls to her death.
[01:35:53.973 --> 01:35:56.476]  Well, at least, you know, she didn't feel much falling.
[01:35:56.476 --> 01:35:58.938]  Looks like at least eight stories.
[01:35:58.938 --> 01:36:06.366]  Ever seen that famous black and white photo?
[01:36:06.366 --> 01:36:08.067]  See if you guys can pull it up.
[01:36:08.067 --> 01:36:10.530]  Photo of woman who jumped off Empire State's building.
[01:36:10.530 --> 01:36:11.471]  It's a black and white photo.
[01:36:11.471 --> 01:36:12.832]  It's an old fifties car.
[01:36:12.832 --> 01:36:13.993]  Beautiful woman.
[01:36:13.993 --> 01:36:16.616]  Still got her lipstick on.
[01:36:16.616 --> 01:36:17.397]  Car's all crushed.
[01:36:19.599 --> 01:36:22.961]  Now if you hit the concrete, you splatter everywhere and you don't look pretty like that.
[01:36:22.961 --> 01:36:27.044]  So if you want to look pretty, you got to do it on top of, you know, a car.
[01:36:27.044 --> 01:36:30.707]  Cars are so cheap now, you'd probably go right through it, but that was an old steel car.
[01:36:30.707 --> 01:36:38.132]  We kind of did like a trampoline for her, but she did die.
[01:36:38.132 --> 01:36:40.434]  There it is.
[01:36:40.434 --> 01:36:42.915]  Boyfriend broke up with her.
[01:36:42.915 --> 01:36:43.636]  She wasn't too happy.
[01:36:43.636 --> 01:36:44.917]  Look at her pretty feet, everything.
[01:36:46.857 --> 01:36:47.798]  That's so tragic.
[01:36:47.798 --> 01:36:52.262]  Never kill yourself over a lost love.
[01:36:52.262 --> 01:36:56.565]  Better to go out and selflessly serve the innocent.
[01:36:56.565 --> 01:37:01.830]  If you want to kill yourself, give everything over to standing up for what's right.
[01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:05.213]  Don't make it so easy for the devil.
[01:37:05.213 --> 01:37:12.139]  If you're guilty of things you've done, do the right thing and pay God back.
[01:37:12.139 --> 01:37:14.481]  God's only looking at your heart, not at what you've done.
[01:37:17.642 --> 01:37:18.643]  God's seen a few things.
[01:37:18.643 --> 01:37:22.205]  A little more than just a few things.
[01:37:22.205 --> 01:37:36.797]  We're gonna go to your phone calls now, but that woman falling to her death trying to escape coronavirus is now the most shocking video of a list of just unbelievable videos here.
[01:37:36.797 --> 01:37:39.779]  See, this isn't a Netflix series.
[01:37:39.779 --> 01:37:42.681]  This is the real world.
[01:37:42.681 --> 01:37:43.842]  All right, let's go to your phone calls.
[01:37:49.793 --> 01:38:08.085]  Hey Alex, you know, make no mistake, it's not what they're cooking up, it's what they've already cooked up, just as Adam Schiff, as the Russia hoax imploded, already had the impeachment stuff lined up.
[01:38:08.085 --> 01:38:09.546]  Exactly, so have we gotten any hint?
[01:38:09.546 --> 01:38:13.108]  Because I'm trying to find out what it's going to be.
[01:38:13.108 --> 01:38:17.391]  Yeah, I mean, I'm kind of with you, I think it's going to be,
[01:38:17.935 --> 01:38:25.717]  You know, some of the recycled stuff, but I think they gain ground with their base when they use lawfare.
[01:38:25.717 --> 01:38:29.317]  You know, and I would be interested to see what Robert Barnes has to say.
[01:38:29.317 --> 01:38:33.558]  Oh yeah, they're funding massive lawsuits.
[01:38:33.558 --> 01:38:34.898]  They filed a bunch more against Trump.
[01:38:34.898 --> 01:38:38.599]  So yeah, just harass the living hell out of him and his family.
[01:38:38.599 --> 01:38:47.241]  Well, the other thing is with the coronavirus, two weeks ago on Sunday night when Mike Adams put the article out that pretty much described how this would exponentially expand.
[01:38:47.961 --> 01:38:51.524]  I sent that to three of my friends who are physicians.
[01:38:51.524 --> 01:38:53.605]  One of them was, you know, bought into it.
[01:38:53.605 --> 01:39:00.691]  Two of them were, you know, in their physician over-educated hubris sort of scoffed at the whole idea.
[01:39:00.691 --> 01:39:02.672]  However, on Friday, I talked to one of them.
[01:39:02.672 --> 01:39:04.373]  He said, this is crazy.
[01:39:04.373 --> 01:39:12.620]  I sent him the Dr. Boyle interview you had and also the other interview that was done previously by that other outlet.
[01:39:12.620 --> 01:39:15.682]  And we had a long conversation for about an hour, and he says,
[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:19.862]  You know, he said he didn't apologize, but he was like, man, you're right.
[01:39:19.862 --> 01:39:30.747]  And so I think when you get, you know, the physicians and the intellectual people involved with this and buying into it, there's no one.
[01:39:30.747 --> 01:39:33.448]  There's no way that this can be hidden any longer.
[01:39:33.448 --> 01:39:35.669]  I don't think.
[01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:37.190]  Well, I'll say this.
[01:39:37.190 --> 01:39:38.951]  Band on video is really exploding.
[01:39:38.951 --> 01:39:43.093]  So listeners are doing a great job getting the videos out.
[01:39:43.093 --> 01:39:43.553]  We're getting.
[01:39:44.827 --> 01:39:47.948]  Four, five, six million views a day now on Banned.Video.
[01:39:47.948 --> 01:39:50.809]  That really pisses Google off and the establishment.
[01:39:50.809 --> 01:39:54.211]  They thought they would silence everybody, but they have not silenced you, so keep it up.
[01:39:54.211 --> 01:39:59.393]  But yes, Dr. Boyle said on Friday the White House should investigate this as man-made.
[01:39:59.393 --> 01:40:02.394]  Hours later, they made that announcement, and I asked him to come back on.
[01:40:02.394 --> 01:40:07.736]  He said he will in a few days when he has more to say, but just unbelievable.
[01:40:08.632 --> 01:40:10.353]  How obvious it is this is engineered.
[01:40:10.353 --> 01:40:20.496]  Do you think they accidentally released it or is Xi Jinping releasing it as a way to save face and cover up the fact they just lost a trade war with the United States?
[01:40:20.496 --> 01:40:22.557]  Well, I mean, look at who benefits.
[01:40:22.557 --> 01:40:32.720]  Like you were saying, whether it was accidentally released or done on purpose, it benefits their, you know, social credit score top-down control system.
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:38.242]  So, either way, they win and it also does help them save face because they're getting their ass kicked
[01:40:39.297 --> 01:40:41.278]  You know, right now, economically.
[01:40:41.278 --> 01:40:48.321]  One other thing I wanted to mention, Alex, is about, you know, several years ago, you guys played this video.
[01:40:48.321 --> 01:40:49.802]  It's called Chicago Unchained.
[01:40:49.802 --> 01:40:51.943]  Well, I'm on the ground in Chicago.
[01:40:51.943 --> 01:40:53.964]  I get down to the produce market very early.
[01:40:53.964 --> 01:40:56.145]  I'm in the food sales business.
[01:40:56.145 --> 01:41:00.187]  And one of my friends I've been friends with for about 10 years, a black guy, he has this concealed carry.
[01:41:00.187 --> 01:41:01.587]  He's a Trump supporter.
[01:41:01.587 --> 01:41:06.970]  And he's trying to get me an interview with one of the guys in that Chicago Unchained video.
[01:41:07.774 --> 01:41:15.598]  And essentially what he's telling me is the black community here in Chicago, he believes there's a lot, a lot of Trump supporters.
[01:41:15.598 --> 01:41:23.121]  The problem is they can't really be that vocal about it within their community because it's kind of a safe space situation.
[01:41:23.121 --> 01:41:25.662]  Additionally, I was at a Super Bowl party.
[01:41:25.662 --> 01:41:29.904]  My buddy right down the street, he's Mexican, second generation.
[01:41:29.904 --> 01:41:35.647]  And out of the 20 people there, half of the guys there who were all Mexican, I was the only white guy.
[01:41:37.658 --> 01:41:39.400]  About half of those guys were Trump supporters.
[01:41:39.400 --> 01:41:46.765]  I had long conversations with them and they're, you know, I feel like the Hispanic community is almost a built-in Trump supporter.
[01:41:46.765 --> 01:41:48.066]  Oh yeah, that's it.
[01:41:48.066 --> 01:41:49.587]  I mean, that's it.
[01:41:49.587 --> 01:41:51.749]  No one's buying that Trump's a racist thing.
[01:41:51.749 --> 01:41:52.590]  The hoax failed.
[01:41:52.590 --> 01:41:52.990]  Right.
[01:41:52.990 --> 01:41:55.232]  So mainstream media's hoax failed.
[01:41:55.232 --> 01:41:58.454]  So what are they going to pull next then?
[01:41:58.454 --> 01:42:05.360]  Well, I mean, they do have to ratchet up the, you know, the race baiting and the, you know,
[01:42:06.788 --> 01:42:12.533]  Possibly a deepfake with, you know, like Tom Arnold was saying, you know, something that... Exactly, but I interrupted you.
[01:42:12.533 --> 01:42:15.616]  You were getting back to the Hispanic community, built-in Trump support.
[01:42:15.616 --> 01:42:16.817]  Oh, yeah.
[01:42:16.817 --> 01:42:19.159]  They, you know, they're pro-family.
[01:42:19.159 --> 01:42:20.680]  They're concerned about MS-13.
[01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:26.265]  You know, here in Chicago, we have the Pilsen neighborhood, which is probably 50,000 Hispanics.
[01:42:26.265 --> 01:42:27.005]  It's very large.
[01:42:27.005 --> 01:42:31.569]  It's just west of Chinatown, if you look at a map of Chicago.
[01:42:34.484 --> 01:42:44.972]  What I'm saying, though, is through talking to those guys, I was surprised that he, in his view, and he lives right there, just like the black community, you know, my friend that I was talking to.
[01:42:44.972 --> 01:42:45.613]  No, no, I hear you.
[01:42:45.613 --> 01:42:46.553]  I gotta jump, Chris.
[01:42:46.553 --> 01:42:46.874]  Thank you.
[01:42:46.874 --> 01:42:47.714]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:42:47.714 --> 01:42:49.656]  But listen, the Democrats are done.
[01:42:49.656 --> 01:42:50.697]  Nobody likes them.
[01:42:50.697 --> 01:42:52.418]  That's why they have election fraud, though.
[01:42:52.418 --> 01:42:53.579]  No one is electing them.
[01:42:53.579 --> 01:42:54.920]  I'm telling you.
[01:42:54.920 --> 01:42:55.701]  I'm telling you.
[01:42:55.701 --> 01:42:56.802]  They have control of the cities, though.
[01:42:57.625 --> 01:43:04.127]  With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin, it's only natural that it starts to crack and take damage.

[01:44:58.700 --> 01:45:06.986]  It was about a week and a half ago that my father came rushing into my office in the morning and said, son, you've got to see this.
[01:45:06.986 --> 01:45:26.340]  The company that holds the patents on the nanosilver that's in our toothpaste, that's in our immune gargle, and that's in some of the other great products, like the super silver wound gel, had reports from back in 2007 with the Pentagon working with A&M and Homeland Security, with the director of Homeland Security, certifying in a restricted document
[01:45:27.501 --> 01:45:33.865]  Confidential documents was noted as that this had been proven in their secret test to be knocking out SARS.
[01:45:33.865 --> 01:45:38.709]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, regardless, now they authorized us to talk about this.
[01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:41.871]  I talked about it on the show last week, just hiding in plain view.
[01:45:41.871 --> 01:45:48.055]  This is a product that we had stockpiled and that we're still selling at 40% off or more with the combos.
[01:45:48.055 --> 01:45:49.156]  So you can get it in your hands.
[01:45:49.156 --> 01:45:52.938]  It's something that's good for everyday use regardless, and it funds the operation.
[01:45:52.938 --> 01:45:57.301]  So info or store.com for your immune gargle and other products that contain this key nanosilver.
[01:45:58.282 --> 01:46:08.373]  It is I, the leader of Cobra, here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and Alex Jones of InfoWars.
[01:46:08.373 --> 01:46:14.340]  Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese, have bought control of your media.
[01:46:14.340 --> 01:46:16.182]  But it's true.
[01:46:16.182 --> 01:46:18.705]  Your people are beginning to awaken.
[01:46:19.325 --> 01:46:30.839]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings, which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[01:46:30.839 --> 01:46:37.827]  Anyone, once we stage these attacks, that does not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by Cobra.
[01:46:41.104 --> 01:46:55.075]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you, like we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed!
[01:46:55.075 --> 01:46:56.276]  Ha ha!
[01:46:56.276 --> 01:47:00.860]  Hail Cobra!
[01:47:00.860 --> 01:47:03.482]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:13.624 --> 01:47:18.507]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[01:47:18.507 --> 01:47:19.688]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:19.688 --> 01:47:23.570]  Alright, I want to hurry through your calls.
[01:47:23.570 --> 01:47:25.931]  We'll continue to the next hour, but Robert Barnes hasn't been on in a while.
[01:47:25.931 --> 01:47:32.895]  He's going to be popping in to talk about the impeachment, how he thinks he'll strike back next, how he thinks the Republicans should strike back.
[01:47:32.895 --> 01:47:35.357]  Let's go to Debbie in Kentucky.
[01:47:35.357 --> 01:47:36.297]  Debbie, thanks for holding.
[01:47:36.297 --> 01:47:36.858]  You're on the air.
[01:47:36.858 --> 01:47:37.158]  Welcome.
[01:47:38.083 --> 01:47:40.364]  Well, hi there Alex, how are you doing today?
[01:47:40.364 --> 01:47:41.385]  I'm great, talking to you.
[01:47:41.385 --> 01:47:49.148]  I've been listening to you for quite a while now, and you've really informed me on a lot of things, and I want to thank you for that.
[01:47:49.148 --> 01:47:54.050]  You woke me up a long time ago, which is why I see things differently now.
[01:47:54.050 --> 01:47:57.152]  How did you originally find us, Debbie, and how long ago?
[01:47:57.152 --> 01:48:00.173]  Oh God, it's been 15 years.
[01:48:00.173 --> 01:48:01.674]  I don't even remember how.
[01:48:03.188 --> 01:48:07.592]  But I know when I thought I lost you, it sent me into a panic.
[01:48:07.592 --> 01:48:12.857]  So that's another story, but it's like, okay, where am I going to get the truth from now?
[01:48:12.857 --> 01:48:19.583]  So you were listening to us one way and it went away, but you ended up finding another way to hear us.
[01:48:19.583 --> 01:48:19.863]  Right.
[01:48:19.863 --> 01:48:21.865]  Well, yeah, I've changed states.
[01:48:21.865 --> 01:48:25.529]  So in the Chicago area, you know, there's a lot of ways to listen to you.
[01:48:26.403 --> 01:48:28.364]  That's right, we've always had audiences.
[01:48:28.364 --> 01:48:31.345]  Chicago, we always have a station or two up there.
[01:48:31.345 --> 01:48:35.266]  They're always changing, but yeah, Chicago's always been good folks to us.
[01:48:35.266 --> 01:48:38.167]  Right, it changes, and then it's fighting you again.
[01:48:38.167 --> 01:48:41.207]  That's half the battle.
[01:48:41.207 --> 01:48:47.809]  And then now, you know, now they're trying to kick you off, so fighting you again is another hard thing to do.
[01:48:50.543 --> 01:48:58.127]  Well, that's why I'm not bragging, but our audience, our listeners, our crew, our guests, we're the real McCoy.
[01:48:58.127 --> 01:49:05.090]  You know, you just don't find four-leaf clovers everywhere because the enemy doesn't want people to have access to it because it's too successful.
[01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:11.053]  Everywhere we're put on a radio station, they'll put us on a station with almost no ratings, we'll go to number one or number two within one year.
[01:49:11.053 --> 01:49:14.654]  But then someone always comes in and leases it or buys it to get me off.
[01:49:14.654 --> 01:49:15.795]  It's crazy.
[01:49:15.795 --> 01:49:17.936]  Well, you're posting the truth.
[01:49:18.986 --> 01:49:24.108]  They make fun of you, but how many times have you been wrong?
[01:49:24.108 --> 01:49:29.850]  That's what it comes...CNN, the Alphabet groups like that, they're always wrong.
[01:49:29.850 --> 01:49:33.931]  But how many times with your information have you been wrong?
[01:49:33.931 --> 01:49:37.912]  That's the whole point, and that's why people come back.
[01:49:37.912 --> 01:49:39.673]  They know you're not going to lie to them.
[01:49:39.673 --> 01:49:42.934]  You're not going to, you know... Hey, if I don't know, I don't know.
[01:49:42.934 --> 01:49:43.634]  That's what you say.
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:47.481]  You know, but this is what I think, this is what it looks like.
[01:49:47.481 --> 01:49:50.442]  You give us the facts, and that's all people want nowadays.
[01:49:50.442 --> 01:49:53.362]  Well, I appreciate you putting up with me, Debbie.
[01:49:53.362 --> 01:49:55.483]  What's your view on the coronavirus?
[01:49:55.483 --> 01:49:57.163]  Oh, well, see, that's the whole point.
[01:49:57.163 --> 01:50:05.005]  You know, I've been listening to you for a while, and I'm wondering why you haven't brought the sirens up to this prominent precinct.
[01:50:05.005 --> 01:50:07.126]  Say that again?
[01:50:07.126 --> 01:50:11.387]  There's this thing called AlphaGal that's relatively new.
[01:50:12.691 --> 01:50:18.035]  I mean, here it's from Mississippi over to the East Coast, we're covered in it.
[01:50:18.035 --> 01:50:21.298]  I mean, patients are popping up left and right.
[01:50:21.298 --> 01:50:31.106]  Coronavirus is bad, but alpha-gal makes you allergic to red meat, pork, lamb.
[01:50:31.106 --> 01:50:34.830]  Ma'am, I do know about people now having allergic responses to meat.
[01:50:36.044 --> 01:50:37.945]  And I have read about that.
[01:50:37.945 --> 01:50:41.347]  I wasn't understanding what you were talking about at first.
[01:50:41.347 --> 01:50:51.814]  We're becoming totally allergic to our own environment because mainly the vaccines have so many contaminants that your body then has an autoimmune response to all of those.
[01:50:51.814 --> 01:50:54.235]  And a lot of them are grown on red meat.
[01:50:54.235 --> 01:50:57.557]  Also, a lot of vaccines now have the whole human genome in them.
[01:50:57.557 --> 01:51:00.359]  So then you're becoming allergic to your own human genome.
[01:51:00.359 --> 01:51:04.622]  But even if you're not taking vaccines, when you eat GMO crops,
[01:51:05.362 --> 01:51:10.246]  Your body has an autoimmune response to that, and then it starts having an autoimmune response to everything else.
[01:51:10.246 --> 01:51:11.647]  So, yes ma'am, I am aware of it.
[01:51:11.647 --> 01:51:13.188]  Give us your view on it.
[01:51:13.188 --> 01:51:13.929]  No, no, no.
[01:51:13.929 --> 01:51:15.710]  You're talking something totally different.
[01:51:15.710 --> 01:51:19.493]  Now, you brought me to light with the vaccines and all.
[01:51:19.493 --> 01:51:22.455]  No, this is from a tick bite.
[01:51:22.455 --> 01:51:26.719]  This is a disease you get from a tick bite.
[01:51:26.719 --> 01:51:29.741]  And it makes you allergic.
[01:51:29.741 --> 01:51:31.002]  And it's brand new out.
[01:51:31.002 --> 01:51:32.283]  I mean, it's not 10 years.
[01:51:33.544 --> 01:51:34.424]  No, ma'am.
[01:51:34.424 --> 01:51:34.944]  I've seen it.
[01:51:34.944 --> 01:51:37.125]  They claim people think it's spread by ticks.
[01:51:37.125 --> 01:51:39.545]  I'm not sure that's the case.
[01:51:39.545 --> 01:51:46.527]  But what I'm explaining is a lot of these vaccines have a whole human genome in it.
[01:51:46.527 --> 01:51:51.268]  So then your body has an autoimmune response to a human genome.
[01:51:51.268 --> 01:51:53.969]  Well, you're going to have autoimmune responses to anything even close to you.
[01:51:53.969 --> 01:51:54.909]  And what are we very close to?
[01:51:54.909 --> 01:51:58.790]  Pigs and things like that.
[01:51:58.790 --> 01:52:00.370]  I never heard about this.
[01:52:00.370 --> 01:52:03.031]  I didn't know anything until a neighbor down the street got it.
[01:52:03.908 --> 01:52:07.075]  I mean, it's mainly on the East Coast, too, from the Midwest to East.
[01:52:13.087 --> 01:52:16.608]  You know, most the time what they tell you is doing something, it's something else.
[01:52:16.608 --> 01:52:18.588]  We are creating a toxic environment.
[01:52:18.588 --> 01:52:21.069]  The environmentalists tell us it's carbon dioxide we've got to deal with.
[01:52:21.069 --> 01:52:22.449]  No, that's what plants breathe.
[01:52:22.449 --> 01:52:28.131]  But all the GMO and all of that, that's what's crazy, and that's what's causing chain reactions.
[01:52:28.131 --> 01:52:35.813]  And then now all these new vaccines have live, whole, genetically engineered viruses that shed and mutate.
[01:52:35.813 --> 01:52:36.193]  There it is.
[01:52:36.193 --> 01:52:39.214]  Genetic Sequency of Common Vaccine finds entire
[01:52:40.194 --> 01:52:51.021]  Male human genome from aborted human baby, a complete individual at Science News, with abnormal modified genes, 560 genes linked together.
[01:52:51.021 --> 01:52:55.564]  That's scary, isn't it?
[01:52:55.564 --> 01:52:57.865]  Ma'am, think about it.
[01:52:57.865 --> 01:53:08.692]  If you take tetanus, the UN got caught in 96 by Indian scientists, it was all confirmed, adding a female hormone that's only released at the beginning of the second trimester and part of developing the baby.
[01:53:09.750 --> 01:53:17.474]  If you add it to tetanus, the body then has an autoimmune response every time to that, and then attacks the baby and causes an abortion.
[01:53:17.474 --> 01:53:26.118]  Then, because your ovaries are releasing it, the body then attacks the ovaries, and then you have an autoimmune response and have all sorts of cysts and problems.
[01:53:26.118 --> 01:53:30.521]  That's the kind of crap they do, and that's just adding a hormone to a shot.
[01:53:30.521 --> 01:53:32.582]  Who the hell knows what they're doing now?
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:40.703]  They can edit it right into the RNA and DNA, and even universities have trouble picking it up.
[01:53:40.703 --> 01:53:42.124]  Isn't that incredible?
[01:53:42.124 --> 01:53:46.986]  Well, how about the high estrogens in these new Incredible Burgers?
[01:53:46.986 --> 01:53:48.166]  Oh yeah!
[01:53:48.166 --> 01:53:58.051]  The so-called Incredible Burger, a man might as well just put his testicles in a wood chipper if he takes it, and a woman, high estrogen, on top of what will give you, as you know, all sorts of cancer.
[01:53:58.051 --> 01:53:58.671]  God bless you.
[01:53:58.671 --> 01:53:59.572]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:54:01.018 --> 01:54:14.246]  Burger King's Impossible Burger has 44 milligrams of pathogenic estrogen compared to regular burger of 2.5 of phytoestrogen.
[01:54:14.246 --> 01:54:19.669]  I call it pathogenic, which means it spreads, but it's really, it's just all insane.
[01:54:19.669 --> 01:54:24.812]  Doctor says high estrogen in Burger King's Impossible will grow breast on men.
[01:54:24.812 --> 01:54:25.593]  I just can't handle it.
[01:54:25.593 --> 01:54:26.633]  Thank you so much.
[01:54:26.633 --> 01:54:27.174]  Great caller.
[01:54:28.208 --> 01:54:29.329]  I say I can take a bunch of calls.
[01:54:29.329 --> 01:54:30.530]  These callers are all so good, though.
[01:54:30.530 --> 01:54:32.952]  You get a lot of time here, and I appreciate you.
[01:54:32.952 --> 01:54:36.635]  Who's up next here?
[01:54:36.635 --> 01:54:37.575]  Jonathan in Florida.
[01:54:37.575 --> 01:54:39.277]  I'm glad you're calling about this.
[01:54:39.277 --> 01:54:43.100]  Imagine if a Republican ran into a tent and ran over six people.
[01:54:43.100 --> 01:54:46.522]  You'd never hear the end of it, like one poor person happened in Virginia.
[01:54:46.522 --> 01:54:47.303]  Charlottesville.
[01:54:47.303 --> 01:54:50.866]  But almost no coverage of what happened, Jonathan.
[01:54:50.866 --> 01:54:52.067]  Alex, it's great to talk to you.
[01:54:52.067 --> 01:54:53.788]  I've listened to you for a long time.
[01:54:53.788 --> 01:54:55.009]  I won't keep you for long.
[01:54:55.009 --> 01:54:55.790]  No, please go ahead.
[01:54:55.790 --> 01:54:57.071]  All the callers are so great.
[01:54:58.342 --> 01:55:03.565]  Keep coming up with great talking points to contemplate about.
[01:55:03.565 --> 01:55:17.812]  But back to what happened here recently, you know, I guess the point I wanted to make was the people that we're dealing with are not Democrats at this point.
[01:55:17.812 --> 01:55:20.574]  They are a creation of the Democrat Party.
[01:55:20.574 --> 01:55:23.475]  The Democrat Party has created them for the last 50 years.
[01:55:25.410 --> 01:55:40.253]  And the ideology that these people have invested in can only lead to this type of violence, which took place here in a blue-collared, conservative town like Jacksonville just a few days ago.
[01:55:40.253 --> 01:55:44.733]  And like you were saying, imagine a Republican doing that.
[01:55:44.733 --> 01:55:46.454]  You would never hear the end of it.
[01:55:46.454 --> 01:55:52.315]  It would be the CNN, MSNBC talking point for the next year and a half.
[01:55:55.222 --> 01:56:02.747]  The sides are definitely skewed, but there is only one place that these people will go to, and it's going to be violence.
[01:56:02.747 --> 01:56:03.807]  They are radicals.
[01:56:06.465 --> 01:56:13.290]  They are communists, and they say they're going to overthrow, they're going to kill anybody that doesn't submit to them.
[01:56:13.290 --> 01:56:19.315]  And just like the guy that went to kill all the members of the Republican baseball team, and CNN said the guy was a hero.
[01:56:19.315 --> 01:56:23.999]  Wolf Blitzer's show said he's not a monster, he was attacking what he believed was evil.
[01:56:23.999 --> 01:56:29.243]  And so that's who these people are, and that's what they're going to do, and you're absolutely right.
[01:56:29.243 --> 01:56:31.725]  What do we do about it?
[01:56:31.725 --> 01:56:35.588]  I think that we can't pull the first shot.
[01:56:36.266 --> 01:56:42.692]  We have to play defense here, but luckily we have a Second Amendment that protects us from it.
[01:56:42.692 --> 01:56:58.466]  And these clowns who are going to use cars... Just to the audience, when you're going out in this campaign season in 2020 and you're going to vote, maybe you're going to go to a campaign rally, just be extremely cautious.
[01:56:59.479 --> 01:57:03.161]  Don't be, it's not to be too frightened, too afraid to go out.
[01:57:03.161 --> 01:57:05.082]  No, no, don't let them intimidate you.
[01:57:05.082 --> 01:57:07.523]  Come out in even bigger numbers and come out packing.
[01:57:07.523 --> 01:57:11.985]  Because thank God our founders saw a time when bullies would try something like this.
[01:57:11.985 --> 01:57:15.207]  And the answer is the Second Amendment to defend ourselves.
[01:57:15.207 --> 01:57:18.108]  Jonathan, great points and God bless you.
[01:57:18.108 --> 01:57:20.310]  Alright, that's it for this hour.
[01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:26.933]  Please don't forget, we sold out of the 16 ounce nano silver that's so good to counter the whole coronavirus family.
[01:57:28.530 --> 01:57:29.871]  We have the 3-ounce left.
[01:57:29.871 --> 01:57:34.115]  It's selling out quickly, as well as the 1-ounce that's selling out very, very quickly.
[01:57:34.115 --> 01:57:37.078]  And it's great to have, regardless of where you're on your hands and body.
[01:57:37.078 --> 01:57:39.220]  You can also ingest it.
[01:57:39.220 --> 01:57:40.722]  It's at infomorestore.com.
[01:57:40.722 --> 01:57:46.167]  And the entire toothpaste line, both Super Blue and Super Silver tooth whitening, have it in it as well.
[01:57:47.765 --> 01:57:53.591]  I want to talk about Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[01:57:53.591 --> 01:57:57.154]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[01:57:57.154 --> 01:57:59.456]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[01:57:59.456 --> 01:58:01.278]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[01:58:01.278 --> 01:58:08.865]  So here I am telling people Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[01:58:08.865 --> 01:58:09.285]  And I'm 45 years old.
[01:58:10.106 --> 01:58:12.087]  And I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[01:58:12.087 --> 01:58:13.767]  And it's fluoride free.
[01:58:13.767 --> 01:58:17.008]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the Coral Calcium.
[01:58:17.008 --> 01:58:20.630]  Because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean.
[01:58:20.630 --> 01:58:25.291]  And the toothpaste, I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[01:58:25.291 --> 01:58:27.672]  It feels so good.
[01:58:27.672 --> 01:58:30.733]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[01:58:30.733 --> 01:58:36.935]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now.
[01:58:36.935 --> 01:58:38.596]  Because I like the way it feels.
[01:58:48.894 --> 01:58:50.595]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[01:58:50.595 --> 01:58:52.717]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroer.
[01:58:52.717 --> 01:58:54.478]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[01:58:54.478 --> 01:58:56.220]  But I'll be honest with you.
[01:58:56.220 --> 01:59:01.564]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[01:59:01.564 --> 01:59:03.425]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[01:59:03.425 --> 01:59:04.726]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[01:59:04.726 --> 01:59:05.447]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:59:06.485 --> 01:59:07.946]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[01:59:07.946 --> 01:59:10.648]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[01:59:10.648 --> 01:59:11.809]  I don't want them to win.
[01:59:11.809 --> 01:59:14.732]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.
[01:59:14.732 --> 01:59:17.834]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[01:59:17.834 --> 01:59:20.996]  And we'll expand and really give the globalists a run for their money.
[01:59:20.996 --> 01:59:24.799]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[01:59:24.799 --> 01:59:26.361]  These will change your life.
[01:59:26.361 --> 01:59:27.782]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[01:59:27.782 --> 01:59:29.783]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[01:59:29.783 --> 01:59:30.504]  Check it all out.
[01:59:30.504 --> 01:59:32.425]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[01:59:32.425 --> 01:59:34.207]  Be part of the second American revolution.
[01:59:34.207 --> 01:59:35.408]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[01:59:35.768 --> 01:59:37.770]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:07.939 --> 02:00:17.791]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:17.791 --> 02:00:25.460]  Du... Du hast... Du hast mich!
[02:00:25.460 --> 02:00:27.743]  Du... Du hast...
[02:00:31.066 --> 02:00:34.909]  All right ladies and gentlemen, Robert Barnes is going to be joining us coming up.
[02:00:34.909 --> 02:00:42.874]  I'll continue with Craig and Hayden and Levi and Smig and Eric and Neil and CJ and all of you right into the fourth hour today.
[02:00:42.874 --> 02:00:45.456]  We also have the video that's up on Infowars.com.
[02:00:45.456 --> 02:00:49.059]  Attorney General Barr takes on human trafficking and child welfare system.
[02:00:49.059 --> 02:00:50.179]  We're going to get to that.
[02:00:50.179 --> 02:00:55.363]  Also video Pompeo sounds alarm over China's attempt to suppress free speech in America.
[02:00:57.816 --> 02:00:58.777]  And so much more.
[02:00:58.777 --> 02:01:00.758]  But let me go ahead and go to this right now.
[02:01:00.758 --> 02:01:03.241]  Head of Barnes joining us.
[02:01:03.241 --> 02:01:06.783]  It's a very important report.
[02:01:06.783 --> 02:01:09.466]  And it's clip four.
[02:01:09.466 --> 02:01:14.770]  It's the dawn of race-specific bio-warfare is upon us.
[02:01:14.770 --> 02:01:20.895]  Again, the dawn of race-specific bio-warfare is upon us.
[02:01:20.895 --> 02:01:22.276]  This bio-attack
[02:01:23.527 --> 02:01:32.750]  Is race-specific targeting specifically Chinese military age males.
[02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:38.492]  And that almost all the people infected and almost all of those dying are males.
[02:01:38.492 --> 02:01:40.673]  That's hidden in the literature.
[02:01:40.673 --> 02:01:42.494]  The medical reports.
[02:01:42.494 --> 02:01:51.057]  And then you get the scan by the major Indian scientific gene-splicing university and it's conclusive!
[02:01:52.950 --> 02:02:05.059]  And now other groups have looked at it and said, yeah, it's even got the insertion gene that you see with RNA and gene editing where it was injected.
[02:02:07.349 --> 02:02:10.513]  There's signatures right there.
[02:02:10.513 --> 02:02:13.236]  So I'm not going to give the U.S.
[02:02:13.236 --> 02:02:25.090]  government a pass and say for sure that somebody in the deep state on the American team isn't pissed at enough fentanyl being shipped in every couple months to kill the entire world population.
[02:02:25.791 --> 02:02:28.012]  You're like, that's what shipped into the U.S.?
[02:02:28.012 --> 02:02:29.013]  Yes.
[02:02:29.013 --> 02:02:30.153]  Enough to kill the whole world.
[02:02:41.155 --> 02:02:45.358]  That's why you see homeless everywhere laying out, asleep during the day, asleep at night.
[02:02:45.358 --> 02:02:47.740]  They're not asleep, they're passed out on fentanyl.
[02:02:47.740 --> 02:03:03.693]  But you pull back from this, and you think about what's going on in China, they need an excuse to clamp down on their political enemies, a way to unify the population under control, a way to get the world to endorse their tyranny, something Trump's suddenly done that's wrong.
[02:03:03.693 --> 02:03:06.896]  You're like, oh, they would never kill millions of their own military-aged men.
[02:03:06.896 --> 02:03:07.877]  It's called a balance.
[02:03:10.275 --> 02:03:15.958]  I did fall pregnant for a second time, Jiang Xinping tells me, but I had an abortion.
[02:03:15.958 --> 02:03:20.620]  Did you have a choice?
[02:03:20.620 --> 02:03:22.821]  I couldn't keep it, she replies.
[02:03:22.821 --> 02:03:26.863]  You either go willingly, or the government comes for you.
[02:03:26.863 --> 02:03:28.604]  That's what the Chai comms talk about.
[02:03:28.604 --> 02:03:30.025]  One child policy.
[02:03:30.025 --> 02:03:31.085]  This is even from Wikipedia.
[02:03:31.085 --> 02:03:33.787]  I don't just believe Wikipedia, it links through to all the government sources.
[02:03:35.179 --> 02:03:43.243]  According to Chinese government, 400 million births have been prevented and tens of millions have been killed after they're born.
[02:03:43.243 --> 02:03:46.404]  China's sex ratio is out of whack.
[02:03:46.404 --> 02:03:49.966]  117.7 boys to every 100 girls.
[02:03:49.966 --> 02:03:53.527]  That means higher crime rates and fewer eligible brides.
[02:03:53.527 --> 02:03:56.729]  So if they'll kill 400 million people, mainly girls...
[02:03:57.867 --> 02:04:02.892]  Will they release a race-specific bioweapon only targeting military-age men?
[02:04:02.892 --> 02:04:05.254]  Yes, because they've done the demographics.
[02:04:05.254 --> 02:04:16.165]  And they've got an internal problem because there's hundreds of millions of more men than women, and they can't find women.
[02:04:16.165 --> 02:04:18.207]  So see, first they took the girls away from you.
[02:04:19.582 --> 02:04:25.826]  Then they let you get up to 30 years old or whatever, let you extinguish some of your energy, and now they're just gonna kill you.
[02:04:25.826 --> 02:04:29.809]  The evidence mounts, this is a race-specific bioweapon, well we know it's that.
[02:04:29.809 --> 02:04:37.934]  The evidence mounts that the Chi-Coms launched this against themselves to save face about their economic collapse, their lost war with the US.
[02:04:38.875 --> 02:04:41.319]  And as a way to clamp down and control their population.
[02:04:41.319 --> 02:04:44.883]  I remember my grandfather going, they want us to have a nuclear war.
[02:04:44.883 --> 02:04:51.632]  The Chinese dictator, whoever it was after Mao died, says he wants us to nuke them because they want to get rid of their population.
[02:04:51.632 --> 02:04:53.855]  They're the only group in the world that wants to get rid of them.
[02:04:53.855 --> 02:04:54.757]  That's why they fed into this.
[02:04:56.283 --> 02:04:57.444]  Don't be a victim.
[02:04:57.444 --> 02:05:02.306]  If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard, because that can lower your immune system.
[02:05:02.306 --> 02:05:06.588]  Drink extra purified, clean water, so that no toxins weigh you down, but you have plenty of hydration.
[02:05:06.588 --> 02:05:08.989]  Prayer and meditation has been proven to make you healthier.
[02:05:08.989 --> 02:05:12.450]  Get plenty of vitamin C, get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil.
[02:05:12.450 --> 02:05:14.411]  Take your colloidal silver, all of it, fats.
[02:05:14.611 --> 02:05:17.733]  What allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep?
[02:05:17.733 --> 02:05:27.560]  We have sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle that has the nanosilver that's patented and documented and even admitted in documents we've shown to go after this whole Corona SARS family of virus.
[02:05:27.560 --> 02:05:30.121]  We're almost sold out of the one ounce spray bottles.
[02:05:30.121 --> 02:05:34.704]  That'll be sold out a couple days and we're about a week and a half or so of the super silver three ounce bottles.
[02:05:34.704 --> 02:05:35.865]  Great to have period.
[02:05:35.865 --> 02:05:36.866]  Really good for your gums.
[02:05:36.866 --> 02:05:37.446]  Really great for your
[02:05:37.526 --> 02:05:40.530]  We also have a super silver and orange whitening toothpaste.
[02:05:40.530 --> 02:05:45.496]  Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products with this top nanotech company based here in the U.S.
[02:05:45.496 --> 02:05:49.041]  that's in all these Homeland Security documents and everything, because we get the best stuff.
[02:05:49.041 --> 02:05:50.183]  There's a lot of patriots.
[02:05:50.183 --> 02:05:51.785]  There's not just bad guys coming after us.
[02:05:51.785 --> 02:05:54.768]  There's a flip side of all the good guys and good gals.
[02:05:54.768 --> 02:05:55.529]  It's very exciting.
[02:06:08.977 --> 02:06:15.780]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:15.780 --> 02:06:25.924]  Alright, we're taking calls this hour into the next, and we've got constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes, who's been really busy, but has now been able to come on today.
[02:06:25.924 --> 02:06:28.405]  We really appreciate him coming on.
[02:06:29.636 --> 02:06:32.678]  We have the big headline up on InfoWars.com.
[02:06:32.678 --> 02:06:34.960]  It's a big Drudge Report headline as well.
[02:06:34.960 --> 02:06:44.966]  Clean House Trump fires 70 Obama holdovers from National Security Council.
[02:06:44.966 --> 02:06:49.129]  That's a big News Wars story up on InfoWars.com as well.
[02:06:49.129 --> 02:06:55.774]  President Trump has reportedly removed over 70 Obama-era holdovers from his staff, including the National Security Council.
[02:06:56.817 --> 02:06:57.918]  But that's not good enough.
[02:06:57.918 --> 02:07:02.681]  We need the neocons and the Soroses removed.
[02:07:02.681 --> 02:07:04.622]  The purge comes after Trump fired Lt.
[02:07:04.622 --> 02:07:05.042]  Col.
[02:07:05.042 --> 02:07:19.932]  Alexander Vidman and his twin brother from the NSC Friday along with Ambassador to Ukraine Gordon Sondland for their insubordinate roles as witnesses in the Democrat impeachment campaign that failed last week.
[02:07:19.932 --> 02:07:24.575]  And now they're trying to say him firing people is a violation.
[02:07:31.991 --> 02:07:40.635]  They're now saying that the President doesn't have the power to fire people that leak disinformation.
[02:07:40.635 --> 02:07:42.216]  They don't just leak.
[02:07:42.216 --> 02:07:44.997]  They leak disinformation from a separate branch of government.
[02:07:44.997 --> 02:07:55.442]  Can you imagine if President Trump had a communist Chinese spy running his operations like Dianne Feinstein?
[02:07:56.817 --> 02:08:01.239]  The Democratic Party, by its very nature, is a traitorous organization now.
[02:08:01.239 --> 02:08:07.421]  It's not a party, it's an international cabal of criminals.
[02:08:07.421 --> 02:08:08.682]  And so, Robert Barnes joins us.
[02:08:08.682 --> 02:08:09.982]  I want to cover the waterfront with him.
[02:08:09.982 --> 02:08:10.863]  Great to have him back.
[02:08:10.863 --> 02:08:20.947]  I want to look at what happened in the impeachment, what he saw with the trial, how he thinks they're going to strike back next, what he sees happening with the virus and so much more.
[02:08:20.947 --> 02:08:23.528]  So, Robert, great to have you back with us.
[02:08:23.528 --> 02:08:24.188]  Hey, glad to be here.
[02:08:24.977 --> 02:08:26.038]  Well, where do you want to start?
[02:08:26.038 --> 02:08:27.439]  I mean, I laid out a lot of stuff there.
[02:08:27.439 --> 02:08:29.360]  You haven't been on in a month or so.
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:34.263]  You want to go over what you saw in the impeachment, the trial, how you think they're going to strike back next?
[02:08:34.263 --> 02:08:40.748]  Well, I mean, I think the impeachment was sort of stage two of the constant deep state war with Trump.
[02:08:40.748 --> 02:08:45.111]  I mean, it started with people who were connected to Joe Biden in that expanded National Security Council.
[02:08:45.111 --> 02:08:47.772]  That's where the two stories sort of interact today.
[02:08:47.772 --> 02:08:54.257]  Obama expanded the National Security Council to include a bunch of professional class hacks that are really personal political emissaries.
[02:08:54.637 --> 02:09:00.961]  With the power of the State Department and the CIA accessible to them as members of the National Security Council.
[02:09:00.961 --> 02:09:21.893]  It was one of those people who were purportedly advising Joe Biden who asked, according to Rudy Giuliani, asked the Ukrainians to do illicit inquiries into Trump campaign officials, to Trump himself, Trump's family members, and to Paul Manafort that led to probably the bogus black book out of Ukraine and other items that that's what Trump was trying to investigate and inquire into.
[02:09:22.413 --> 02:09:26.680]  And it was one of those connected people that he had left on his National Security Council.
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:36.535]  So he'd left all these political appointees, this dramatic expansion, a tripling of the size of the National Security Council, all these Obama's shadow government deep state holdovers.
[02:09:37.464 --> 02:09:51.548]  Another one of these Yale-Ivy League connected parties, another young kid with no real life experience, just professional class bias, to be in a position where they could be spying on the President when he was trying to investigate their corruption and their collusion.
[02:09:51.548 --> 02:09:56.370]  And it was, frankly, it was the reason why they took out General Flynn all the way back at the beginning.
[02:09:56.370 --> 02:09:57.670]  Flynn was going to clean house.
[02:09:57.670 --> 02:10:00.591]  Flynn was going to have done this two years ago, three years ago.
[02:10:00.591 --> 02:10:04.572]  Going to get rid of all these NSC hirees that were just political appointees of Obama.
[02:10:05.712 --> 02:10:15.514]  And so now Trump has learned his lesson, and this is exactly what Steve Pucinich and you and everybody have said.
[02:10:15.514 --> 02:10:19.835]  He was so nice, or just didn't know, and let it double, triple, and side left him all there.
[02:10:19.835 --> 02:10:22.696]  They took that as weakness and began beavering away.
[02:10:22.696 --> 02:10:25.236]  It shouldn't be 70, but this is the good news.
[02:10:25.236 --> 02:10:26.797]  First three, now 70.
[02:10:26.797 --> 02:10:29.497]  It should be logarithmic, exponential.
[02:10:29.497 --> 02:10:31.778]  Maybe, I mean, because there's thousands in there.
[02:10:32.338 --> 02:10:36.262]  Really, I've been told a hundred people could run the National Security Council.
[02:10:36.262 --> 02:10:40.345]  So they need to get rid of thousands of these people.
[02:10:40.345 --> 02:10:44.389]  They need to get rid of all of these political appointees and attachés in the State Department, high-ranking.
[02:10:44.389 --> 02:10:47.332]  Unfortunately, they've now infiltrated the CIA, the NSA.
[02:10:47.332 --> 02:10:50.795]  Brennan was putting key people at all kinds of places before he left.
[02:10:50.795 --> 02:10:54.118]  So they need to look at anybody that's... So anybody Brennan or his adjuncts appointed is gone?
[02:10:55.012 --> 02:10:55.333]  Exactly.
[02:10:55.333 --> 02:10:56.394]  They need to be heated.
[02:10:56.394 --> 02:11:00.138]  To Trump's credit, he's immediately taking proactive action.
[02:11:00.138 --> 02:11:03.181]  The impeachment woke him up.
[02:11:03.181 --> 02:11:09.869]  Similar to sort of past populist politicians of both the left and the right, Huey Long, Jim Folsom, you go back to other people.
[02:11:09.869 --> 02:11:16.456]  They are usually, they attempt to impeach them or indict them and that wakes them up to their need to be aggressive and assertive in protecting themselves.
[02:11:16.716 --> 02:11:17.277]  They cannot.
[02:11:17.277 --> 02:11:19.518]  Trump wanted to believe he could negotiate with these people.
[02:11:19.518 --> 02:11:20.759]  These people would be fair.
[02:11:20.759 --> 02:11:22.100]  These people would be reasonable.
[02:11:22.100 --> 02:11:22.681]  They're not.
[02:11:22.681 --> 02:11:26.024]  They're ruthless people who have no sense of morality, purpose, or loyalty.
[02:11:26.024 --> 02:11:26.444]  That's right.
[02:11:26.444 --> 02:11:28.405]  And no sense of people fighting back.
[02:11:28.405 --> 02:11:31.508]  No two-way street understanding of waking the sleeping giant.
[02:11:31.508 --> 02:11:33.590]  You have been hammering on this show for six months.
[02:11:33.590 --> 02:11:35.531]  I've been hammering it as well.
[02:11:35.531 --> 02:11:37.933]  That we need a new church committee.
[02:11:37.933 --> 02:11:39.034]  Explain the history of that.
[02:11:39.034 --> 02:11:40.895]  Now I see Steve Bannon out saying that everywhere.
[02:11:41.956 --> 02:11:50.182]  And look, you know, Steve, I want to be friends with Steve, but my God, two shows called The War Room, everything I say word for word, two days later, you know, transcribed and copied.
[02:11:50.182 --> 02:11:53.004]  I mean, I guess it's a good thing that I'm like the mouth of Steve Bannon now.
[02:11:53.004 --> 02:11:56.667]  I mean, I load his brain with the info, and you as well.
[02:11:56.667 --> 02:11:59.369]  Not against Steve, just pointing out, we're original thinkers here.
[02:11:59.369 --> 02:12:00.449]  So here's us saying stuff.
[02:12:00.449 --> 02:12:03.512]  You heard Steve Bannon say, you shouldn't tune in six months ago.
[02:12:03.512 --> 02:12:09.476]  But clearly, Trump needs to champion a new church committee hearing in the Senate, and
[02:12:09.756 --> 02:12:12.278]  You know, get some key people in there.
[02:12:12.278 --> 02:12:18.164]  Get people like Josh Hawley, you know, and others in the position to take real action.
[02:12:19.255 --> 02:12:19.595]  Exactly.
[02:12:19.595 --> 02:12:34.544]  What they should do is they should appoint Rand Paul, the head of the new church committee on corruption in our NSE, in our intelligence apparatus, in our intelligence infrastructure, in the national security apparatus, and go at it full-scale and wholesale and expose everything that was happening.
[02:12:34.544 --> 02:12:34.824]  That's right.
[02:12:34.824 --> 02:12:36.985]  Don't just investigate the fake charges against Trump.
[02:12:36.985 --> 02:12:38.306]  That's too small.
[02:12:38.306 --> 02:12:41.828]  Go after the whole thing where they've nakedly lied to FISA courts.
[02:12:41.828 --> 02:12:46.211]  I mean, let's chronicle what they... First, tell folks what the church committee was that made on them.
[02:12:47.688 --> 02:12:47.968]  Exactly.
[02:12:47.968 --> 02:12:52.992]  So Frank Church was the first senator ever investigated or illicitly spied on by the NSA.
[02:12:52.992 --> 02:12:56.474]  So as soon as he got the opportunity after Watergate, he formed a special committee.
[02:12:56.474 --> 02:13:05.921]  The Committee on Intelligence originated as a special select committee on intelligence, which was Frank Church's committee to investigate corruption in our intelligence apparatus and law enforcement apparatus.
[02:13:06.261 --> 02:13:08.882]  And it's the church committee that exposed MKUltra.
[02:13:08.882 --> 02:13:12.362]  It's the church committee that exposed assassination attempts around the world.
[02:13:12.362 --> 02:13:19.244]  It was the church committee that exposed illicit spying, the first major illicit spying by the National Security Agency and by the FBI.
[02:13:19.244 --> 02:13:25.925]  It was the church committee that went into the MLK assassinations, that went into domestic assassinations and international assassinations.
[02:13:25.925 --> 02:13:28.506]  Operation Mockingbird, everything we know is from that.
[02:13:29.483 --> 02:13:30.184]  Exactly.
[02:13:30.184 --> 02:13:42.932]  The full confirmation corroboration of what people suspected was true, but had never been documented in court or Congress before, was documented and demonstrated and evidently substantiated by the Church Committee.
[02:13:42.932 --> 02:13:46.514]  That's why we need another Church Committee to clean up the corruption that corrodes the highest ranks.
[02:13:46.514 --> 02:13:56.320]  And you're right, Ian Paul is the perfect person that nobody doubts is nonpartisan, is a constitutionalist, and Trump should call for him to be appointed as the head of a new committee?
[02:13:56.320 --> 02:13:56.941]  Or how would that work?
[02:13:57.898 --> 02:14:07.602]  Yeah, a select committee, a committee whose only goal and objective is this, that he would be in charge of, and to replicate the church committee in its entirety.
[02:14:07.602 --> 02:14:16.005]  And that's how we finally, instead of them launching witch hunts, we have all their naked admissions of illegal spying, this puts them back on their heels finally.
[02:14:16.005 --> 02:14:17.105]  This is the offensive.
[02:14:17.105 --> 02:14:27.309]  Instead of waiting for what they're going to cook up next, Trump must go on the offense, not with some paltry investigations about how he was targeted, no, how America was targeted by the deep state.
[02:14:27.589 --> 02:14:30.150]  How they try to steal an election.
[02:14:30.150 --> 02:14:30.490]  Exactly.
[02:14:30.490 --> 02:14:43.457]  It needs to be a deep state corruption committee in the same way, in the same scale, in the same jurisdictional scope that Church had that could meaningfully expose just how bad it is and bring back the people that Flynn was going to bring in.
[02:14:43.457 --> 02:14:47.159]  There's a whole bunch of people within that apparatus who want to expose corruption and collusion within it.
[02:14:47.159 --> 02:14:49.160]  There are still patriots at the highest ranks of government.
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:51.421]  Oh yeah, we're not saying all the agencies are bad people.
[02:14:51.421 --> 02:14:54.382]  We need oversight and crossover and separation of powers.
[02:14:54.382 --> 02:14:55.743]  We're going to go to break, but think about this.
[02:14:56.411 --> 02:15:02.154]  Well go ahead and just tell me now, how do you think they're going to try to come off the president next if he doesn't go on the offense immediately?
[02:15:02.154 --> 02:15:03.394]  Stage 3 is definitely coming.
[02:15:03.394 --> 02:15:07.636]  I think they were thinking about these firings, but I think they recognize it's too close in time.
[02:15:07.636 --> 02:15:11.238]  So stage 3 is either going to be right in the middle of the election or right after the election.
[02:15:11.238 --> 02:15:15.020]  My guess is it's coming as an October surprise against President Trump again.
[02:15:16.209 --> 02:15:18.892]  But what would it be, I'm asking, at that level?
[02:15:18.892 --> 02:15:22.317]  Oh, it will be of the same type.
[02:15:22.317 --> 02:15:24.800]  It will be same international orientation.
[02:15:24.800 --> 02:15:28.284]  It will be some sort of Russian collusion component again.
[02:15:28.284 --> 02:15:30.848]  But they've tried the campaign aspect.
[02:15:30.848 --> 02:15:32.510]  They've tried the institutional aspect.
[02:15:32.510 --> 02:15:34.012]  So my guess is this one's going to be personal.
[02:15:34.505 --> 02:15:38.567]  They're going to try to go after him or his son and try to tie it into money in some way.
[02:15:38.567 --> 02:15:38.987]  That's right.
[02:15:38.987 --> 02:15:46.871]  They're going to try to find somebody that's done something corrupt in their giant orbit, threaten them with prison if they don't say Trump laundered money or something.
[02:15:46.871 --> 02:15:47.252]  I agree.
[02:15:47.252 --> 02:15:49.613]  They're going to go after mafia ties next.
[02:15:49.613 --> 02:15:51.354]  That's what my gut tells me.
[02:15:51.354 --> 02:15:51.734]  All right.
[02:15:51.734 --> 02:15:52.254]  We'll be back.

[02:15:56.868 --> 02:15:58.169]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[02:15:58.169 --> 02:16:01.911]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[02:16:01.911 --> 02:16:02.992]  Forget bunkers.
[02:16:02.992 --> 02:16:04.813]  You're not a live underground gopher.

[02:18:06.616 --> 02:18:08.997]  Prayer and meditation has been proven to make you healthier.
[02:18:08.997 --> 02:18:12.478]  Get plenty of vitamin C. Get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil.
[02:18:12.478 --> 02:18:14.138]  Take your colloidal silver, all of it.
[02:18:14.138 --> 02:18:17.759]  That's what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep.
[02:18:17.759 --> 02:18:21.180]  We have sold out of a 16 ounce immune gargle that has the nano

[02:18:34.735 --> 02:18:35.896]  Great to have, period.

[02:18:37.918 --> 02:18:40.541]  We also have the super silver in our whitening toothpaste.

[02:18:45.587 --> 02:18:48.970]  It's in all these Homeland Security documents and everything, because we get the best stuff.
[02:18:48.970 --> 02:18:50.212]  There's a lot of patriots.

[02:18:51.813 --> 02:18:54.797]  There's a flip side of all the good guys and good gals.

[02:18:57.964 --> 02:19:01.225]  This should really be easier than it is.
[02:19:01.225 --> 02:19:03.366]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[02:19:03.366 --> 02:19:05.827]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[02:19:05.827 --> 02:19:19.292]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself you will see how amazing it is and then your support of the product we're selling will help you
[02:19:19.992 --> 02:19:20.052]  I'm

[02:19:59.400 --> 02:20:02.021]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:23.479 --> 02:20:29.081]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:29.081 --> 02:20:32.963]  All right, back by popular demand, Robert Barnes, justice and lawyer.
[02:20:32.963 --> 02:20:38.104]  These smart guys riding shotgun with us today on this Monday transmission.
[02:20:38.104 --> 02:20:41.506]  I wanted to take calls, and he's going to host a little bit in the next hour.
[02:20:41.506 --> 02:20:42.606]  He said, hey, I'm going to stay as long as you want.
[02:20:42.606 --> 02:20:45.727]  I said, well, how about you host a little bit before Gerald Cervalente comes on?
[02:20:45.727 --> 02:20:50.349]  Gerald's awesome, but I would like to hear Bob host a little bit about what he wants to cover.
[02:20:50.349 --> 02:20:52.010]  But just getting back to what you were saying,
[02:20:54.218 --> 02:21:04.421]  A few months ago before we went to break, the Democrats can't give up because in their districts it's been proven they're not being re-elected, they're not popular.
[02:21:04.421 --> 02:21:09.243]  And even scientific polls show record numbers of blacks, record numbers of Hispanics.
[02:21:09.243 --> 02:21:11.623]  In a lot of polls it's 30, 40, 50 percent.
[02:21:11.623 --> 02:21:13.604]  This is the end of the Democratic Party.
[02:21:13.604 --> 02:21:16.265]  Just like the Labor Party's basically done in England.
[02:21:16.265 --> 02:21:20.826]  People have really broken with it and they understand that they tried to cause a race war.
[02:21:20.826 --> 02:21:23.207]  People get they're being talked down to and manipulated.
[02:21:24.924 --> 02:21:34.481]  I don't see how they bounce back from this, but they're not going to give up because they're financed by multinational groups that still believe they can conquer America.
[02:21:34.481 --> 02:21:37.427]  I understand that Trump has dealt with China first.
[02:21:38.447 --> 02:21:44.810]  Before he deals with everything else, because it's communist China that the globalists set up as their main money laundering system.
[02:21:44.810 --> 02:21:46.591]  Ukraine is a secondary system.
[02:21:46.591 --> 02:21:49.073]  Israel's another subsystem.
[02:21:49.073 --> 02:21:50.173]  There's stuff in the Cayman Islands.
[02:21:50.173 --> 02:21:51.054]  It's everywhere.
[02:21:51.054 --> 02:21:56.176]  But with China now more and more being defeated, how do you tie the coronavirus in?
[02:21:56.176 --> 02:21:57.657]  What do you think's really behind it?
[02:21:57.657 --> 02:22:04.501]  What's the big geopolitical view, understanding who controls the deep state Democrats and what they're going to try next?
[02:22:05.680 --> 02:22:10.762]  I mean, I think Trump correctly saw China as a greater threat to America's future than the deep state.
[02:22:10.762 --> 02:22:17.425]  I think what he underestimated was the deep state's ability to interfere with his ability to get anything done vis-a-vis China.
[02:22:17.425 --> 02:22:21.226]  I mean, we've had three major stories in the last month concerning China.
[02:22:21.226 --> 02:22:28.409]  The Chinese corruption of American universities, often the number one contributor to most universities in the United States, particularly the elite universities.
[02:22:28.629 --> 02:22:29.190]  Increasingly.
[02:22:38.662 --> 02:22:39.042]  Exactly.
[02:22:39.042 --> 02:22:40.723]  I mean, it's extraordinary.
[02:22:40.723 --> 02:22:49.367]  UK talking about going along with 5K and going along with a wise investment in that in terms of going back into bed with China, the virus.
[02:22:49.367 --> 02:22:59.672]  And then, of course, today, the announcement that, in fact, a lot of these big hacking that's been going on, including the big hack of over 100 million Americans' credit reports, was by Chinese military officials.
[02:23:00.092 --> 02:23:02.092]  Attorney General Barr announced that today.
[02:23:02.092 --> 02:23:06.493]  So we have this sort of public war with China over problematic behavior by China.
[02:23:06.493 --> 02:23:17.256]  You have Senator Cotton and others talking about what you've been talking about, that this virus appears to have been not accidental, or at least not entirely accidental, in its distribution or creation.
[02:23:17.256 --> 02:23:22.417]  Not the organic origin that some have suggested, raising questions about what's really going on.
[02:23:22.757 --> 02:23:34.439]  You had China today admitting that the virus was at a much more exponential rate of exposure than they originally said, which some people had been forecasting the exact numbers, saying, here's what the real numbers are, and here's how they're going to hide it.
[02:23:34.439 --> 02:23:37.440]  And they forecast those numbers, and that's being publicly reported today.
[02:23:37.440 --> 02:23:47.522]  So you have this extraordinary scope of China's bad actions that are now being put on trial, being exposed by the president, as well as undermining their trade warfare and their mercantilist attacks on the United States.
[02:23:48.342 --> 02:23:54.964]  Well, but what he started to realize is right when he was achieving a lot of those successes and exposing China, they almost took him out with an impeachment effort.
[02:23:54.964 --> 02:23:58.145]  So the deep state is an imminent threat, an immediate threat.
[02:23:58.145 --> 02:24:00.005]  China is the long-term threat.
[02:24:00.005 --> 02:24:03.966]  So this purge is not a purge, it's a cleaning house.
[02:24:03.966 --> 02:24:08.387]  And Bob, I don't want to toot my horn or your horn or anybody's, but I know the White House listens.
[02:24:08.387 --> 02:24:10.007]  I know they've got a whole office, guys.
[02:24:10.007 --> 02:24:11.168]  That's why they want Miller out of there.
[02:24:12.228 --> 02:24:19.371]  We come on Friday with the head of the former bioweapons treaty developer for the U.S., the head guy.
[02:24:19.371 --> 02:24:20.532]  He says they've got to come out.
[02:24:20.532 --> 02:24:22.633]  The White House must say it looks like it's man-made.
[02:24:22.633 --> 02:24:23.553]  Call for investigation.
[02:24:23.553 --> 02:24:24.514]  Five hours later, they do it.
[02:24:25.618 --> 02:24:26.058]  I don't know.
[02:24:45.894 --> 02:24:49.736]  Now obviously that's the right thing to do anyways, but it's crazy.
[02:24:49.736 --> 02:24:52.477]  Are we simpatico with the White House now?
[02:24:52.477 --> 02:25:00.220]  Or are they using Infowars as the populist sounding board because they know we're not controlled to try to get the pulse of the people and doing what we want?
[02:25:00.220 --> 02:25:04.242]  It's not like we're threatening the White House, but it just seems like suddenly everything we want is starting to happen.
[02:25:05.598 --> 02:25:12.584]  Well, I think it has always been the tip of the spear for the populist base of the Trump support base, and he's always paid attention to that.
[02:25:12.584 --> 02:25:30.858]  And I think that the problem has been his willingness and his readiness to take action on it, because he thought he could work with deep state actors to achieve this broader objective of containing China, not recognizing that China has infiltrated large aspects of the deep state apparatus, particularly the think tanks and private universities and other institutions.
[02:25:31.378 --> 02:25:33.081]  People know they can leave U.S.
[02:25:33.081 --> 02:25:36.305]  government service and get their most profitable gigs with China.
[02:25:36.305 --> 02:25:37.227]  That's why Trump was right.
[02:25:37.227 --> 02:25:39.510]  We just saw the top Harvard professor indicted.
[02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.931]  Exactly.
[02:25:40.842 --> 02:25:41.583]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:25:41.583 --> 02:25:48.330]  And it's not a coincidence that Harvard's one of the biggest recipients of Chinese government funds of anybody in the entire country.
[02:25:48.330 --> 02:25:49.591]  But this has been mostly suppressed.
[02:25:49.591 --> 02:25:53.655]  The ordinary person has no clue of the scope and scale to which this is occurring.
[02:25:53.655 --> 02:25:54.196]  And let's be clear.
[02:25:54.196 --> 02:25:56.258]  It's not like China just did this on their own.
[02:25:56.258 --> 02:26:00.843]  People controlling our government for 50 years make one-sided deals to make jobs go to China.
[02:26:00.843 --> 02:26:02.124]  They then get a big fat piece of it.
[02:26:03.357 --> 02:26:03.697]  Exactly.
[02:26:03.697 --> 02:26:05.498]  In fact, I mean, this is a replication.
[02:26:05.498 --> 02:26:07.999]  Kevin Phillips was talking about this in the 80s.
[02:26:07.999 --> 02:26:11.001]  And he was saying what's going to happen is China is going to replicate what the U.S.
[02:26:11.001 --> 02:26:14.082]  did to the U.K., both in terms of manufacturing and political influence.
[02:26:14.082 --> 02:26:16.123]  And that's precisely what's happened since the mid-1990s.
[02:26:16.123 --> 02:26:20.585]  It's the reason why the first real foreign, the actual real foreign interference in the U.S.
[02:26:20.585 --> 02:26:26.888]  election was Chinese donors to the Clinton campaign in 1996 that Janet Reno then hushed up a year later.
[02:26:27.168 --> 02:26:28.469]  Exactly, so let me ask you this.
[02:26:28.469 --> 02:26:34.375]  What's going to happen as it becomes clear that everybody that's been against Trump and us is a Chai Com trader?
[02:26:34.375 --> 02:26:41.401]  This looks like a recipe for victory if Trump just does a national address and points it out with pie charts and the head of the CIA with him in Pompeo.
[02:26:41.401 --> 02:26:42.422]  I mean, it's game over.
[02:26:42.422 --> 02:26:48.748]  You tell Americans you're in league with foreign enemies and we show the Washington Post saying hopefully Xi crushes Trump.
[02:26:48.748 --> 02:26:51.671]  I mean, it's so obvious how they threw their lot in with these guys.
[02:26:52.839 --> 02:27:07.227]  Exactly, and what Trump should do is, he's doing part of it now, go after and purge the deep state apparatus that was a hindrance to making meaningful reform with China, continue to march on China in terms of federal prosecutions, in terms of trade sanctions, and the rest.
[02:27:07.227 --> 02:27:16.592]  But in addition, he really should take a third aspect to that too, which is he doesn't have the support, the outside support, the parallel support he did have when he came in.
[02:27:16.592 --> 02:27:18.673]  Julian Assange is now sitting in a prison cell.
[02:27:21.434 --> 02:27:25.237]  His grassroots infrastructure to be annihilated.
[02:27:25.237 --> 02:27:25.658]  Exactly.
[02:27:25.658 --> 02:27:28.280]  He needs to start to restore that grassroots.
[02:27:28.280 --> 02:27:35.286]  And what he can do, and the way he can start, he can start by pardon Roger Stone now, pardon General Flynn now, pardon Julian Assange now.
[02:27:35.286 --> 02:27:39.590]  I was about to say, if he just signals he cares, it'll triple his support.
[02:27:39.590 --> 02:27:40.291]  Absolutely.
[02:27:40.291 --> 02:27:43.173]  And it will start to restore that grassroots third-party support.
[02:27:43.173 --> 02:27:47.377]  Because they were going after Flynn and Stone and Assange
[02:27:48.323 --> 02:27:57.716]  Not just them out, because they were uniquely influential individuals on behalf of the President, but to terrify anybody else from stepping up for Trump in this next election and within the administration.
[02:27:57.716 --> 02:28:05.067]  And by the way, I don't want to enter myself into this thing, but obviously they tried to take us out too, but only the listeners kept us in play.
[02:28:06.289 --> 02:28:09.790]  Exactly, and what he needs to do is he needs to restore confidence and faith in that.
[02:28:09.790 --> 02:28:20.554]  So he needs to make public efforts towards all the third-party outsider participants that keep him afloat and alive, and show his support of them, show his sympathy towards them, and take executive action where he can.
[02:28:20.554 --> 02:28:28.877]  Because that will signal to that whole crowd, okay, we can now stand up for the president, start to fight for the president, interact for the president, and purge the deep state.
[02:28:28.877 --> 02:28:31.237]  And it's not like we even want the protection.
[02:28:31.237 --> 02:28:33.898]  We want the general saying, I'm with you, attack.
[02:28:33.898 --> 02:28:35.659]  It's him silent is what people don't like.
[02:28:36.870 --> 02:28:37.611]  Exactly, correct.
[02:28:37.611 --> 02:28:45.423]  I mean, the protection can be as simple as a pardon in the case of those three individuals, but for everyone else it can simply be rhetorical and by association.
[02:28:45.423 --> 02:28:48.787]  He started to do it... Hold on, stay right there.
[02:28:48.787 --> 02:28:49.328]  We'll come back.
[02:28:49.328 --> 02:28:49.909]  We'll take calls.
[02:28:49.909 --> 02:28:50.750]  Robert Barnes is our guest.
[02:28:50.750 --> 02:28:51.071]  Stay with us.
[02:28:55.316 --> 02:28:59.859]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:28:59.859 --> 02:29:01.960]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:03.681]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:03.681 --> 02:29:10.244]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:10.244 --> 02:29:15.327]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:15.327 --> 02:29:20.030]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:20.470 --> 02:29:23.571]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[02:29:23.571 --> 02:29:30.594]  They'll immerse you into a 30 day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[02:29:30.594 --> 02:29:35.775]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.

[02:31:56.149 --> 02:32:00.193]  Almost all the other big storable food companies are sold out of food.
[02:32:00.193 --> 02:32:05.718]  But I know for a fact from sources, they're telling people, oh, we've got it, get your order in, two weeks for delivery.
[02:32:05.718 --> 02:32:07.540]  We follow this pattern over and over again.
[02:32:07.540 --> 02:32:09.221]  I've been on radio for 25 years.
[02:32:09.221 --> 02:32:11.383]  I've had storable food for a long time.
[02:32:11.383 --> 02:32:19.831]  And I learned very quickly, a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times, but during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory, they'll still take your orders.
[02:32:20.051 --> 02:32:35.081]  That's why about 11 years ago I found MyPatriotSupply, now the biggest, most trusted company out there, and I became a private labeler for them, because they actually have it on hand, they actually give it delivered to you on time, they do what they're gonna say they're gonna do, because they want you as a customer over and over again, and they're good people.
[02:32:35.081 --> 02:32:39.985]  Now, they were saying 7 to 10 days before shipping, because they've got the food, but they've got to package it record-level orders.
[02:32:40.285 --> 02:32:45.028]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[02:32:45.028 --> 02:32:47.009]  So get your orders in at mfulwarsaw.com.

[02:32:50.971 --> 02:32:52.352]  Then it funds the M4 as well.
[02:32:52.352 --> 02:32:53.253]  So get prepared.
[02:32:53.253 --> 02:32:59.356]  mfulwarsaw.com with Sorible Foods.
[02:32:59.356 --> 02:33:01.978]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:12.367 --> 02:33:13.689]  The Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:13.689 --> 02:33:19.075]  Because there is a war on, or you're mine.
[02:33:19.075 --> 02:33:23.299]  I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind.
[02:33:23.299 --> 02:33:28.145]  There was something so pleasant about that place.
[02:33:28.145 --> 02:33:31.549]  Even your emotions had an echo in so much space.
[02:33:40.646 --> 02:33:52.410]  You know, there's not just evil in this universe, there's good as well.
[02:33:52.410 --> 02:33:57.552]  And America and much of the world has been asleep, but now we're in a time of awakening.
[02:33:57.552 --> 02:34:03.034]  And all those that thought they had it all sewed up are in for a very, very rude awakening.
[02:34:03.034 --> 02:34:04.235]  Now, talking to Barnes here,
[02:34:05.646 --> 02:34:16.593]  There are thousands of channels of cable and hundreds of new Netflix shows a week, and it seems like everybody wants to be an actor in the movies, and there's all this fantasy land.
[02:34:16.593 --> 02:34:19.555]  But I know listeners understand this.
[02:34:19.555 --> 02:34:22.357]  This is real.
[02:34:22.357 --> 02:34:27.180]  And I don't sit back and go, man, we're one of the only big, well-produced, powerful shows.
[02:34:27.180 --> 02:34:31.502]  There's a lot of smart people out there doing little shows, which I wish were huge.
[02:34:31.502 --> 02:34:33.864]  But we're one of the only, if not the only, organization
[02:34:35.779 --> 02:34:38.541]  That's actually giving the globalists a run for their money.
[02:34:38.541 --> 02:34:39.282]  And guess what?
[02:34:39.282 --> 02:34:41.903]  People wanted prosperity and freedom and justice.
[02:34:41.903 --> 02:34:44.545]  They didn't want globalism.
[02:34:44.545 --> 02:34:47.968]  Because if I'm anything, I'm a salesman.
[02:34:47.968 --> 02:34:50.630]  All that means is you promote ideas you believe in.
[02:34:50.630 --> 02:34:51.531]  I'm a father.
[02:34:51.531 --> 02:34:52.751]  I'm a fighter.
[02:34:52.751 --> 02:34:56.934]  I'm a lot of things, but... I mean, I sell things I believe in.
[02:34:56.934 --> 02:34:59.436]  Like freedom.
[02:34:59.436 --> 02:35:00.857]  Don't have to give me any money for it.
[02:35:00.857 --> 02:35:04.080]  You just gotta believe in it and believe what I'm saying and believe it for yourself.
[02:35:05.182 --> 02:35:06.783]  Promote it!
[02:35:06.783 --> 02:35:24.575]  And I need to sell you on how valuable you are, I need to sell you on the strength you've got, so you don't sit there and say it's all over, America's done, there's nothing we can do, right at the time that we're starting to turn the tide.
[02:35:24.575 --> 02:35:30.900]  When you wake up and you realize how bad things are, a lot of times people give up, but you just woke up, you were already
[02:35:32.978 --> 02:35:38.619]  It'd be like driving down the road and your buddy falls asleep in the middle of the night driving back from elk hunting.
[02:35:38.619 --> 02:35:40.759]  This happened to me once.
[02:35:40.759 --> 02:35:43.320]  And you drive off a big embankment down a cliff.
[02:35:43.320 --> 02:35:44.760]  By the grace of God, we didn't die.
[02:35:44.760 --> 02:35:48.701]  It was incredible that we hit the one spot and shot back up and then flipped three times.
[02:35:48.701 --> 02:35:51.821]  And I didn't wake up until we were flipping.
[02:35:51.821 --> 02:35:55.222]  Now if I had stayed asleep and we hit a tree and died, would I have been any safer?
[02:35:55.222 --> 02:35:55.802]  No.
[02:35:55.802 --> 02:35:59.643]  By the time I woke up and we were starting to flip, I was like, man, I was asleep and he ran off the road.
[02:36:01.144 --> 02:36:03.666]  Once the police got there in like an hour, they're like, you're lucky you're alive.
[02:36:03.666 --> 02:36:11.271]  We ran way down this multi-hundred foot deal and up and it hit and jumped and then the thing flipped like something out of a movie.
[02:36:11.271 --> 02:36:16.455]  And I was only like 16 years old when that happened.
[02:36:16.455 --> 02:36:20.017]  But if I'd have been killed in that and never woke up, I still would have been in the wreck.
[02:36:20.017 --> 02:36:22.799]  But I was awake during it and I lived.
[02:36:22.799 --> 02:36:28.103]  And so just because we've woken up now and we're in the middle of a wreck, we're going to make it through this wreck.
[02:36:29.076 --> 02:36:31.057]  And what we do after it is what matters.
[02:36:31.057 --> 02:36:32.578]  So that's my weird allegory.
[02:36:32.578 --> 02:36:34.459]  I didn't think that up on the fly.
[02:36:34.459 --> 02:36:37.361]  It's something that happened to me and I was just comparing it to what's happening today.
[02:36:37.361 --> 02:36:41.144]  Robert Barnes, smart constitutional lawyer.
[02:36:41.144 --> 02:36:42.885]  It's Trump's to lose now.
[02:36:42.885 --> 02:36:44.286]  They are demoralized.
[02:36:44.286 --> 02:36:50.610]  I don't go out in public now and get spit at for every 500 hands I shake or whatever I get spit at.
[02:36:50.610 --> 02:36:53.411]  Now they just look demoralized and scared.
[02:36:53.411 --> 02:36:55.373]  But a lot of leftists now kind of smile at me.
[02:36:56.417 --> 02:36:58.559]  And come over and say, maybe we were wrong.
[02:36:58.559 --> 02:37:04.346]  So I'm seeing grassroots in Austin, that's basically San Francisco's rear end.
[02:37:04.346 --> 02:37:06.769]  I'm even seeing them not just give up on hating me.
[02:37:06.769 --> 02:37:12.695]  I'm seeing them actually shake it off and realize they were under a cult-like programming.
[02:37:12.695 --> 02:37:13.256]  What are you seeing?
[02:37:14.551 --> 02:37:22.838]  Well, I think there's no question that the Democratic Party is sort of out of sorts, because essentially they sort of made a deep state alliance, both in the Mueller inquiry and with impeachment.
[02:37:22.838 --> 02:37:25.340]  I think they in part thought that's why it would work.
[02:37:25.340 --> 02:37:30.744]  They would replicate Watergate's deep state apparatus that was behind the going after Nixon.
[02:37:31.064 --> 02:37:33.586]  And then if they did it, if they duplicated it, they would have success.
[02:37:33.586 --> 02:37:35.027]  Instead, they had total failure.
[02:37:35.027 --> 02:37:38.610]  People like Professor Dershowitz made the same argument I and other people were arguing.
[02:37:38.610 --> 02:37:46.335]  The entire impeachment effort was unconstitutional, was a violation of the High Crimes and Misdemeanors Clause because they didn't charge a high crime or misdemeanor.
[02:37:46.335 --> 02:37:48.497]  Ultimately, the acquittal vindicates that position.
[02:37:48.977 --> 02:37:52.780]  And so I think to that sense, they feel dismayed.
[02:37:52.780 --> 02:37:55.943]  They also clearly lack institutional integrity.
[02:37:55.943 --> 02:38:00.366]  They lack the sort of people beyond Bernie and other, you know, Tulsi Gabbard, one or two others.
[02:38:00.366 --> 02:38:03.548]  They have nobody who people even think of as honest.
[02:38:03.548 --> 02:38:07.832]  And they think of Bernie as honest, but not necessarily the ideas they want to embrace.
[02:38:07.832 --> 02:38:13.216]  And so the, I mean, clearly the deep state has a planted candidate, in my view, in the Democratic primary process.
[02:38:13.616 --> 02:38:20.801]  If people research Pete Buttigieg's background, he has a very unusual Obama-like background, but it's even weirder than Obama's.
[02:38:20.801 --> 02:38:22.122]  I mean, he comes out of nowhere.
[02:38:22.122 --> 02:38:23.483]  Yeah, he's completely synthetic.
[02:38:24.745 --> 02:38:25.206]  Absolutely.
[02:38:25.206 --> 02:38:29.509]  I mean, his father was the translator for Antonio Gramsci's writings.
[02:38:29.509 --> 02:38:33.452]  The sort of very good analytical writing, but communist-influenced writing.
[02:38:33.452 --> 02:38:36.454]  So that gives you an idea for his background.
[02:38:36.454 --> 02:38:42.959]  And yet he is being... I mean, here's a guy who's just a mayor of a tiny town, who's suddenly a leading candidate for the presidency of the United States.
[02:38:42.959 --> 02:38:43.600]  How does that happen?
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:47.903]  He also is one of those guys that somehow ended up in the military but never went through basic training.
[02:38:47.903 --> 02:38:49.905]  He got some special direct commission.
[02:38:49.905 --> 02:38:56.510]  And it's like, who gave this kid a sudden direct commission that was purely a show gig that appeared to be CIA ties to where he was working?
[02:38:56.510 --> 02:39:01.153]  He appears to have been simply a CIA front guy in Afghanistan, not an actual real vet.
[02:39:01.153 --> 02:39:07.198]  And yet the media is pretending he's a veteran and removing the only actual veteran from the debate stage in the last debate in New Hampshire.
[02:39:07.598 --> 02:39:13.983]  So these are clearly a coordinated effort to elevate him because the deep state doesn't trust Bernie.
[02:39:13.983 --> 02:39:17.506]  They despise Trump, but they distrust Bernie.
[02:39:17.506 --> 02:39:19.667]  So they want someone other than him.
[02:39:19.667 --> 02:39:21.609]  I mean Hillary always wanted to run again.
[02:39:21.609 --> 02:39:26.993]  I don't think it will happen now, but she wants to keep saying she is behind the scenes to maintain control of the apparatus.
[02:39:27.955 --> 02:39:35.378]  Well, she's creating, it's Hubert Humphrey 1968, the whole election feels a lot like 1968 or 1972, depending on which one you pick.
[02:39:35.378 --> 02:39:44.021]  And right now, even the sort of liberal data nerds... Now, you said it three months ago, she wants to broker the Broker Convention and be the kingmaker.
[02:39:44.941 --> 02:39:45.321]  Exactly.
[02:39:45.321 --> 02:39:47.742]  Her goal is to recreate 1968.
[02:39:47.742 --> 02:39:57.007]  The best way to recreate 1968 is to have Bernie with the most delegates, but nowhere near a majority, and to make sure there's no one who could replace her.
[02:39:57.007 --> 02:40:00.629]  Notice Kamala Harris is out.
[02:40:00.629 --> 02:40:02.450]  Elizabeth Warren is struggling.
[02:40:02.450 --> 02:40:09.533]  So the degree to which it's Buttigieg and Biden and Bernie and that crew, Hillary is in the best position to come in and steal it.
[02:40:10.194 --> 02:40:14.236]  Because she can steal from each part of the groups and she can promise different things to different people.
[02:40:14.236 --> 02:40:17.577]  And they're also talking about making her the VP.
[02:40:17.577 --> 02:40:20.818]  Yeah, I mean, there's talk about it.
[02:40:20.818 --> 02:40:23.039]  I would never make Hillary Clinton my VP.
[02:40:23.039 --> 02:40:25.060]  You're asking to be assassinated.
[02:40:25.060 --> 02:40:29.142]  Yes, you need a big, big, big, big life insurance policy for that.
[02:40:29.142 --> 02:40:34.184]  You're like Malcolm X at the end of his life where nobody would even give him a life insurance policy no matter how much he would pay.
[02:40:34.184 --> 02:40:37.385]  If Hillary's your VP, you have no life insurance policy.
[02:40:38.486 --> 02:40:44.129]  So, I mean, I think there's different aspects of that, but I think the deep state apparatus doesn't trust any of these people.
[02:40:44.129 --> 02:40:48.932]  They would be okay with Bloomberg, who's sort of been a corrupt billionaire for a long time.
[02:40:48.932 --> 02:40:53.115]  But Bloomberg, there's no way the Democratic Party and the Bernie folks are going to go nuts.
[02:40:53.115 --> 02:40:54.976]  Yeah, why is Bloomberg there?
[02:40:54.976 --> 02:41:00.400]  He's just a cover for spending hundreds of millions, if not billions, he says, against Trump.
[02:41:00.400 --> 02:41:03.482]  He's just there as a cover to get around campaign finance.
[02:41:04.420 --> 02:41:05.060]  That's half of it.
[02:41:05.060 --> 02:41:08.042]  The other half of it is to prevent Bernie from getting a majority.
[02:41:08.042 --> 02:41:09.482]  Bloomberg wants delegates.
[02:41:09.482 --> 02:41:23.088]  And as long as he hits 15% in some of these big, heavy, vote-rich states on Super Tuesday where he is spending close to half a billion dollars already, then he can prevent anybody from getting a majority and he can become a kingmaker at the Democratic Party Convention.
[02:41:23.088 --> 02:41:24.229]  I'm definitely going to be there in Milwaukee.
[02:41:24.229 --> 02:41:25.970]  I've got a lot of old friends in Milwaukee.
[02:41:25.970 --> 02:41:27.570]  Milwaukee's going to look like Chicago 1968.
[02:41:27.570 --> 02:41:30.832]  We're going to be there covering it.
[02:41:30.832 --> 02:41:31.272]  Stay there.
[02:41:31.272 --> 02:41:32.933]  I promise callers when we come out of break.
[02:41:33.393 --> 02:41:35.254]  We're going to give each caller about a minute or so.
[02:41:35.254 --> 02:41:39.017]  Patty and Greg and Hayden and Steve and Schmig first and Levi and everybody.
[02:41:39.017 --> 02:41:52.666]  We'll get to you and then Barnes will take over a few segments and then we're going to have the great analysis of Terrell Cilente coming up just briefly because I didn't even really plug this hour.
[02:41:52.666 --> 02:41:55.087]  Who's got Homeland Security?
[02:41:57.330 --> 02:42:02.352]  Certified nanosilver that they said kill SARS, which is the same family as Corona.
[02:42:02.352 --> 02:42:04.412]  All I know is this is immune gargle.
[02:42:04.412 --> 02:42:05.353]  You can swish it out.
[02:42:05.353 --> 02:42:06.713]  You can drink it.
[02:42:06.713 --> 02:42:10.174]  It's super high quality from the top nanotech company here in the US.
[02:42:10.174 --> 02:42:12.595]  We're the only folks that are allowed to private label this.
[02:42:12.595 --> 02:42:14.595]  It's sold out.
[02:42:14.595 --> 02:42:16.956]  Three ounce is still available at current sales rates.
[02:42:16.956 --> 02:42:18.317]  It'll be gone in a week.
[02:42:18.317 --> 02:42:19.477]  The current sales rates, the
[02:42:21.658 --> 02:42:22.359]  Alex, we have to reorder it.
[02:42:44.755 --> 02:42:47.016]  There's a lot of phony garbage out there in the world.
[02:42:47.016 --> 02:42:48.157]  A lot of people that never deliver.
[02:42:48.157 --> 02:42:51.799]  Well, I'm here to tell you, InfoWars has delivered in royal flush.
[02:43:06.934 --> 02:43:14.218]  A handful of ace of spades because of God, because of the audience of activists, and because of the great team at InfoWars.
[02:43:14.218 --> 02:43:17.580]  And we are all a team, ladies and gentlemen.

[02:44:56.283 --> 02:44:57.864]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:44:57.864 --> 02:45:04.150]  We have a new product, and we got several thousand of these in, and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[02:45:04.150 --> 02:45:15.000]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste, and it doesn't compete with Super Blue that's four to five o'clock little silver and iodine and fluoride free.
[02:45:15.973 --> 02:45:17.714]  The adult or the children's.
[02:45:17.714 --> 02:45:21.277]  These are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers.
[02:45:21.277 --> 02:45:22.178]  People love it.
[02:45:22.178 --> 02:45:30.304]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[02:45:31.044 --> 02:45:33.827]  Then it has the patented silver saw.
[02:45:33.827 --> 02:45:36.529]  Silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause gingivitis.
[02:45:36.529 --> 02:45:37.350]  This is all proven.
[02:45:37.350 --> 02:45:38.911]  You can make claims with this.
[02:45:38.911 --> 02:45:50.102]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[02:45:50.102 --> 02:45:51.463]  So, we're really proud of it.
[02:45:51.463 --> 02:45:52.384]  It funds the operation.
[02:45:52.384 --> 02:45:53.284]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:45:54.065 --> 02:45:56.227]  That's why we're still on air thanks to you.
[02:45:56.227 --> 02:45:57.407]  Don't be a victim.
[02:45:57.407 --> 02:46:02.251]  If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard because that can lower your immune system.
[02:46:02.251 --> 02:46:06.534]  Drink extra purified clean water so that no toxins weigh you down, but you have plenty of hydration.
[02:46:06.534 --> 02:46:08.935]  Prayer and meditation has been proven to make you healthier.
[02:46:08.935 --> 02:46:12.398]  Get plenty of vitamin C. Get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil.
[02:46:12.398 --> 02:46:14.059]  Take your colloidal silver, all of it.
[02:46:14.059 --> 02:46:17.701]  That's what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep.
[02:46:17.701 --> 02:46:21.524]  We have sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle that has the nano silver
[02:46:21.664 --> 02:46:27.487]  That's patented and documented and even admitted in documents we've shown that go after this whole Corona SARS family of viruses.
[02:46:27.487 --> 02:46:30.069]  We're almost sold out of the one ounce spray bottles.
[02:46:30.069 --> 02:46:34.651]  That'll be sold out in a couple days and we're about a week and a half or so of the super silver three ounce bottles.
[02:46:34.651 --> 02:46:35.812]  Great to have, period.
[02:46:35.812 --> 02:46:37.693]  Really good for your gums, really great for your teeth.
[02:46:37.833 --> 02:46:40.474]  We also have a super silver in our whitening toothpaste.
[02:46:40.474 --> 02:46:45.435]  Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products with this top nanotech company based here in the U.S.
[02:46:45.435 --> 02:46:48.955]  that's in all these Homeland Security documents and everything, because we get the best stuff.
[02:46:48.955 --> 02:46:50.116]  There's a lot of patriots.
[02:46:50.116 --> 02:46:51.716]  There's not just bad guys coming after us.
[02:46:51.716 --> 02:46:54.696]  There's a flip side of all the good guys and good gals.
[02:46:54.696 --> 02:46:59.377]  It's very exciting.
[02:46:59.377 --> 02:47:02.018]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:14.498 --> 02:47:28.955]  All right, Robert Barnes is going to host the first half hour, then Carol Celente takes it over, then Owen Schroyer takes over.
[02:47:36.983 --> 02:47:42.565]  And Barnes is going to be handicapping the opening of the Democratic primary tomorrow and how huge that'll be.
[02:47:42.565 --> 02:47:45.046]  We'll be here late tomorrow night covering it all.
[02:47:45.046 --> 02:47:47.747]  Extended coverage after 6pm, look for that.
[02:47:47.747 --> 02:47:51.129]  But I promise I get to these calls and I appreciate you holding so long.
[02:47:51.129 --> 02:47:55.310]  Schmeg in Texas, moving to small towns topic, bugging out.
[02:47:55.310 --> 02:47:56.571]  Thanks for holding.
[02:47:56.571 --> 02:47:58.151]  What is your view on that?
[02:47:58.151 --> 02:48:01.933]  What is your view on what you think people should do?
[02:48:01.933 --> 02:48:04.914]  I agree partially with Charles Murray.
[02:48:05.856 --> 02:48:08.298]  But I agree with you totally.
[02:48:08.298 --> 02:48:14.003]  See, you need to keep standing throughout it.
[02:48:14.003 --> 02:48:17.366]  Mr. Murray's answer was not quite right.
[02:48:17.366 --> 02:48:21.629]  You know, because, you know, if you're tough, you're going to hang in for the long run.
[02:48:21.629 --> 02:48:29.556]  If you have young children, you would you would move out if you could afford to and that you don't run out of time.
[02:48:29.556 --> 02:48:34.180]  The problem is, is what we have is a situation like the Titanic.
[02:48:35.177 --> 02:48:35.697]  We can't.
[02:48:35.697 --> 02:48:39.219]  There's a point where we can't save the ship anymore.
[02:48:39.219 --> 02:48:41.439]  Do we stay with the ship and drown?
[02:48:41.439 --> 02:48:42.460]  No.
[02:48:42.460 --> 02:48:45.901]  We jump out and we try and save ourselves.
[02:48:45.901 --> 02:48:48.222]  And that's at the point that we're at right now.
[02:48:48.222 --> 02:48:52.524]  And so we've got to start building lifeboats because we're not sure.
[02:48:52.524 --> 02:48:53.124]  Exactly.
[02:48:53.124 --> 02:48:56.565]  Right now, President Trump is doing everything he can.
[02:48:56.565 --> 02:48:58.846]  But remember, he's not the fixer.
[02:48:58.846 --> 02:49:00.727]  He's the revealer.
[02:49:00.727 --> 02:49:01.187]  You see?
[02:49:01.187 --> 02:49:03.048]  Because this brings me to my second point.
[02:49:03.712 --> 02:49:07.754]  Will the GOP or the MAGA save you eternally?
[02:49:07.754 --> 02:49:10.635]  The answer is no.
[02:49:10.635 --> 02:49:12.875]  Jesus Christ is your only way.
[02:49:12.875 --> 02:49:15.076]  Now remember, this is for you.
[02:49:15.076 --> 02:49:17.837]  To whom much is given, much is expected.
[02:49:17.837 --> 02:49:24.000]  And I'm very pleased with the way that you've been blossoming in your faith with Jesus Christ.
[02:49:24.000 --> 02:49:30.602]  Now, the third point that I was going to say is that the refugees spreading throughout the United States in bases
[02:49:31.405 --> 02:49:37.766]  Miramar I.E., this is a good example of why you should not do that.
[02:49:37.766 --> 02:49:41.627]  They should have kept them at Nichols Naval Base there in Hawaii.
[02:49:41.627 --> 02:49:44.528]  Why bring them into the cone?
[02:49:44.528 --> 02:49:51.889]  And another point that I have is Executive Order 13295, Obama residue.
[02:49:51.889 --> 02:50:01.231]  Petros tweeted yesterday, or I mean Friday, Shepard Amblis put down that their mobilization is active.
[02:50:01.909 --> 02:50:04.671]  So this was the incubation period.
[02:50:04.671 --> 02:50:07.954]  So now, you know, Obama is trying to mobilize.
[02:50:07.954 --> 02:50:10.356]  The claws of the beast are on us.
[02:50:10.356 --> 02:50:13.918]  They're about to start penetrating.
[02:50:13.918 --> 02:50:19.943]  And we have to be very careful because whether the NCOF comes here, it doesn't matter.
[02:50:19.943 --> 02:50:24.186]  Now they're mobilized and they're ready for the medical martial law.
[02:50:24.186 --> 02:50:25.687]  This is a problem.
[02:50:25.687 --> 02:50:31.532]  Now, the funny point that I'll leave you with is that I knew that Obama was a slimy guy.
[02:50:32.273 --> 02:50:39.634]  And I saw in the Daily News that the worm, it's a Nungara worm.
[02:50:39.634 --> 02:50:41.415]  It's a flat worm.
[02:50:41.415 --> 02:50:43.515]  It's an Obama Nungara.
[02:50:43.515 --> 02:50:47.096]  N-U-N-G-A-R-A worm.
[02:50:47.096 --> 02:50:51.117]  That one is a worm that's invading France right now.
[02:50:51.117 --> 02:50:56.137]  So now we know why President Obama was a slimy creature.
[02:50:56.137 --> 02:50:56.938]  Wow.
[02:50:56.938 --> 02:50:58.058]  Powerful call, Smeg.
[02:50:58.058 --> 02:50:58.778]  Call back again.
[02:51:00.618 --> 02:51:04.661]  It really does come down to the fact that Trump can only reveal stuff.
[02:51:04.661 --> 02:51:07.744]  We have to fix it and God has to begin us to do it.
[02:51:07.744 --> 02:51:10.466]  Can you comment on that, Robert Barnes?
[02:51:10.466 --> 02:51:20.535]  Well, there's no doubt that public participation is critical and essential and that a sort of shared spiritual approach is necessary for any meaningful societal reform of any kind.
[02:51:20.535 --> 02:51:28.802]  What Trump has clearly revealed is not only the media's corruption and collusion in the Democratic Party's problems, that's his Tammany Hall on a global scale,
[02:51:29.122 --> 02:51:53.645]  But it's in addition to all of that, it's the deep state collude corruption and how much it has corroded the highest ranking apparatus, law enforcement, national security, military, all of these high-ranking officials in this part of the government, disproportionately influenced by deep state policies and idolatry that is our greatest threat to any kind of freedom or liberty moving forward, even more so than China because we can't go at China until the deep state problem is solved.
[02:51:54.525 --> 02:51:58.867]  And how narcissistic and in love people like Vidman are of themselves.
[02:51:58.867 --> 02:52:01.168]  It's just bizarre.
[02:52:01.168 --> 02:52:02.689]  Hayden in Missouri, you're on the air.
[02:52:02.689 --> 02:52:04.450]  Thanks for holding, go ahead.
[02:52:04.450 --> 02:52:05.210]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:52:05.210 --> 02:52:07.791]  Long-time listener, first-time caller.
[02:52:07.791 --> 02:52:11.513]  Just want to first say, my Patriot Supplies Food's awesome.
[02:52:11.513 --> 02:52:13.534]  Ordered it from you a couple years ago.
[02:52:13.534 --> 02:52:20.277]  Have two other brands of storable food and that stuff doesn't last as long, then it tastes as good.
[02:52:20.277 --> 02:52:22.098]  But first thing I wanted to say just is,
[02:52:22.961 --> 02:52:30.084]  The numbers of the coronavirus, they started reporting the cases that people have recovered.
[02:52:30.084 --> 02:52:32.605]  And so, 3,669 people have been reported to recover from it.
[02:52:32.605 --> 02:52:33.445]  910 people have died.
[02:52:33.445 --> 02:52:34.846]  That comes out to be a 20% mortality rate.
[02:52:41.957 --> 02:52:46.083]  Even the official numbers now show it has a much higher death rate than they were saying.
[02:52:46.083 --> 02:52:49.007]  Yeah, the Chinese government says 15%.
[02:52:49.007 --> 02:52:50.549]  Barnes, you look at a lot of numbers.
[02:52:50.549 --> 02:52:51.630]  You're a big numbers cruncher.
[02:52:51.630 --> 02:52:52.511]  You're a famous gambler.
[02:52:52.511 --> 02:52:54.133]  Very successful.
[02:52:54.133 --> 02:52:55.175]  What do you think about the numbers?
[02:52:57.484 --> 02:53:00.426]  I think the numbers are going to continue to rise.
[02:53:00.426 --> 02:53:10.975]  Whatever the source, whatever the origin was, whatever the purpose was, the mortality rate has, you know, first it was 5 percent, 10 percent, now it's between 15 and 20 percent, depending on which numbers you believe.
[02:53:10.975 --> 02:53:15.499]  The numbers may be even higher because there's so little adequate information coming out.
[02:53:15.499 --> 02:53:21.965]  What you see is, we're seeing little micro examples now, like the Japanese cruise ship, which a huge number ended up contaminated.
[02:53:22.326 --> 02:53:24.674]  That's a rapid spread of contamination.
[02:53:24.674 --> 02:53:27.404]  And that's just rapid... That's telling you this is pretty nasty.
[02:53:28.346 --> 02:53:30.128]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:53:30.128 --> 02:53:31.249]  And it shows the power of government.
[02:53:31.249 --> 02:53:34.391]  For those people who wonder, like, why would any state be involved in this?
[02:53:34.391 --> 02:53:36.933]  Why would the Chinese government potentially be involved in this?
[02:53:36.933 --> 02:53:40.176]  Well, one, they're showing the power they can unleash on the world.
[02:53:40.176 --> 02:53:44.600]  But putting that aside, I mean, look at how quickly this disease spread.
[02:53:44.600 --> 02:53:51.566]  That, to some degree, is the power of the state to determine just that aspect by its reporting components and by its reaction.
[02:53:51.566 --> 02:53:53.968]  But on top of that, you look at the behavior.
[02:53:53.968 --> 02:53:55.369]  They have people under complete control.
[02:53:55.989 --> 02:53:56.970]  Good morning, Alex.
[02:53:56.970 --> 02:54:02.034]  I'll be really fast because there's a couple of things I want to go through with you.
[02:54:22.443 --> 02:54:30.986]  Back when Hurricane Harvey came out, you'll remember that there was a gentleman, or someone, put a fake Facebook post about gasoline running out.
[02:54:30.986 --> 02:54:33.287]  And there was a panic for gasoline all across Texas.
[02:54:33.287 --> 02:54:34.247]  Yes, I remember that.
[02:54:34.247 --> 02:54:35.108]  Okay.
[02:54:35.108 --> 02:54:36.068]  Well, I'm going to tell you something.
[02:54:36.491 --> 02:54:51.997]  I've been going out and I've been buying water and supplies and I have purchased a ton of stuff through you to help everything and I am just totally dismayed at the total number of people who are got their head in the sand and they're not doing anything to prepare.
[02:54:51.997 --> 02:54:53.817]  Folks, I'm going to tell you something.
[02:54:53.817 --> 02:54:58.279]  You see the videos of people on Black Friday and how nuts they go for Chinese crap.
[02:54:58.903 --> 02:55:01.706]  What do you think is going to happen when the panic sets in?
[02:55:01.706 --> 02:55:02.928]  You think you're going to get water?
[02:55:02.928 --> 02:55:04.710]  You think you're going to get food?
[02:55:04.710 --> 02:55:06.011]  You're not going to be able to find it.
[02:55:06.011 --> 02:55:07.553]  You're not going to be able to get it.
[02:55:07.553 --> 02:55:09.776]  You need to go out now and get your water.
[02:55:09.776 --> 02:55:11.498]  You need to get your dry goods.
[02:55:11.498 --> 02:55:12.899]  You need to get toilet paper.
[02:55:12.899 --> 02:55:16.063]  You need to get everything that you need to sustain yourself for three to six months.
[02:55:16.603 --> 02:55:24.188]  And one of the best ways to do it is also to help Alex promote his program and get his products, and they'll help you.
[02:55:24.188 --> 02:55:25.889]  That's the first thing I wanted to say.
[02:55:25.889 --> 02:55:30.211]  That's a great point, and then hope you don't need it, but this is insurance you can eat.
[02:55:30.211 --> 02:55:31.752]  It's a smart move.
[02:55:31.752 --> 02:55:32.053]  Go ahead.
[02:55:32.053 --> 02:55:38.216]  All right, the second thing I wanted to say is, Alex, you cannot give up.
[02:55:38.216 --> 02:55:39.257]  Nobody can give up.
[02:55:40.251 --> 02:55:50.623]  On those who are ensnared by the devil, taken captive of his will, that are sucked into the Democrats or into this new world odor, as I call it.
[02:55:50.623 --> 02:55:54.127]  Those people are our brothers and sisters.
[02:55:54.127 --> 02:55:55.668]  They are made in the image of God.
[02:55:55.668 --> 02:55:57.410]  They are deceived.
[02:55:57.410 --> 02:55:59.393]  I don't give up on them, so how do you get through to them?
[02:56:00.594 --> 02:56:12.284]  You get through with them, not by judging or condemning them, or calling them names or anything else like that, but you have to reach out through them, through meekness, by the power of the Holy Spirit, by the Spirit of repentance and love.
[02:56:12.284 --> 02:56:15.387]  You have to draw them out of it.
[02:56:15.387 --> 02:56:16.268]  That's the only way.
[02:56:17.166 --> 02:56:20.850]  And if they choose to, because they're ensnared by their choices.
[02:56:20.850 --> 02:56:23.032]  If they choose to listen, they choose to listen.
[02:56:23.032 --> 02:56:25.674]  If they don't, they reap what they sow.
[02:56:25.674 --> 02:56:28.316]  They're responsible and accountable, and there's consequences.
[02:56:28.316 --> 02:56:32.260]  And America hates those two words, responsibility and accountability.
[02:56:32.260 --> 02:56:33.041]  No, I agree with you.
[02:56:33.041 --> 02:56:34.942]  I don't see leftists laughing anymore, actually.
[02:56:34.942 --> 02:56:36.404]  They seem pretty depressed.
[02:56:36.404 --> 02:56:43.210]  So maybe, how do you speak to them and say, listen, you were lied to, it's okay, I'm not perfect either, but here's the truth, and just be loving to them, you think?
[02:56:43.490 --> 02:56:45.051]  Yes, be loving to them.
[02:56:45.051 --> 02:57:01.296]  I mean, no disrespect, Alex, chanting back at them, hey, hey, ho, ho, your IQ is mighty low, that's... No, no, I'm not, believe me, I know it, believe me, I get so sick of them though, I just, you're right, I need to be more loving, I try, I'm just so sick of them.
[02:57:01.816 --> 02:57:03.017]  I'm not putting you down, dude.
[02:57:03.017 --> 02:57:03.958]  I'm not putting you down.
[02:57:03.958 --> 02:57:05.459]  No, I can handle it.
[02:57:05.459 --> 02:57:12.685]  Listen, I know that when somebody says, F you and your children, I should say, man, what would make you say something about somebody's children?
[02:57:12.685 --> 02:57:13.206]  I love you.
[02:57:13.206 --> 02:57:13.886]  I'm sorry.
[02:57:13.886 --> 02:57:14.887]  I forgive you.
[02:57:14.887 --> 02:57:15.768]  They might break down.
[02:57:15.768 --> 02:57:16.489]  I can get through to them.
[02:57:16.489 --> 02:57:17.750]  Instead, I say, F you, let's go.
[02:57:17.750 --> 02:57:19.931]  And I need to get to the point where...
[02:57:20.652 --> 02:57:21.693]  There's a difference.
[02:57:21.693 --> 02:57:23.734]  I'm not Jesus Christ and far from it.
[02:57:23.734 --> 02:57:24.875]  I want to be Christ-like.
[02:57:24.875 --> 02:57:25.496]  I'm not.
[02:57:25.496 --> 02:57:26.356]  I love God, though.
[02:57:26.356 --> 02:57:27.117]  God knows that.
[02:57:27.117 --> 02:57:28.798]  There's a connection.
[02:57:28.798 --> 02:57:30.179]  So I don't give in to the globalist tyranny.
[02:57:30.179 --> 02:57:31.340]  That's my strength.
[02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:33.281]  But I am not good on the Christ-like end.
[02:57:33.281 --> 02:57:34.142]  I agree with you.
[02:57:34.142 --> 02:57:34.762]  Stay there.
[02:57:34.762 --> 02:57:35.563]  Thank you, Levi.
[02:57:35.563 --> 02:57:36.103]  Robert Barnes.
[02:57:36.103 --> 02:57:37.464]  Take a few more calls and he takes over.
[02:57:37.464 --> 02:57:39.326]  Infowars.com.
[02:57:39.326 --> 02:57:40.767]  Newswars.com.
[02:57:40.767 --> 02:57:43.129]  George Soros hopes you don't share those URLs.
[02:57:46.218 --> 02:57:54.602]  I spend a lot of time reminding the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air.
[02:57:54.602 --> 02:57:56.083]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[02:57:56.892 --> 02:58:04.256]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern Paul Revere's.
[02:58:04.256 --> 02:58:11.741]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[02:58:11.741 --> 02:58:20.566]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[02:58:20.566 --> 02:58:25.109]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalists.
[02:58:26.021 --> 02:58:30.723]  We've got three big sales going right now, and one of them has to end within a week, and that's Ultimate Fish Oil for
[02:58:56.408 --> 02:58:57.789]  33% off.
[02:58:57.789 --> 02:58:58.589]  It's amazing.
[02:58:58.589 --> 02:59:00.150]  Go check it out for yourself.
[02:59:00.150 --> 02:59:08.593]  Then we've got, back in stock, X2, our best-selling Deep Earth Crystals Iodine, the good halogen that is the building block to everything in the body.
[02:59:08.593 --> 02:59:10.794]  And I just can't tell you enough how important it is.
[02:59:10.794 --> 02:59:15.676]  The UN admits 2 billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never got enough iodine.
[02:59:15.676 --> 02:59:18.056]  So just check it out for yourself.
[02:59:18.056 --> 02:59:18.497]  40% off.
[02:59:18.497 --> 02:59:19.897]  MFulwarestore.com.
[02:59:19.897 --> 02:59:20.817]  And it funds the MFulwar.
[02:59:20.817 --> 02:59:22.018]  And then, Vitamin
[02:59:22.578 --> 02:59:24.398]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:59:53.846 --> 03:00:01.452]  I love John Petty.
[03:00:01.452 --> 03:00:04.314]  His music's so great.
[03:00:04.314 --> 03:00:08.397]  But I'm going to have to fade it down to go to your phone calls.
[03:00:08.397 --> 03:00:13.400]  It's a great song, though, about a good, strong, pretty girl growing up in the Midwest.
[03:00:13.400 --> 03:00:13.860]  Here it is.
[03:00:13.860 --> 03:00:18.704]  I said I wouldn't fade it down, but I said I would fade it down, and then I said I wouldn't.
[03:00:23.867 --> 03:00:26.749]  You know, I don't tell this story to be a victim.
[03:00:26.749 --> 03:00:28.090]  In fact, I'm an overcomer.
[03:00:28.090 --> 03:00:32.053]  But it happened in Virginia a few times.
[03:00:32.053 --> 03:00:34.855]  It happens in Austin all the time.
[03:00:34.855 --> 03:00:36.116]  It happens when I'm out.
[03:00:36.116 --> 03:00:38.938]  Right in front of my security guys.
[03:00:53.732 --> 03:00:58.434]  This guy walks up and he goes, how's it going with your family?
[03:00:58.434 --> 03:01:00.575]  F you and your family.
[03:01:00.575 --> 03:01:03.036]  Screw you and your family.
[03:01:03.036 --> 03:01:05.538]  And I always go, let's go, let's go.
[03:01:05.538 --> 03:01:09.279]  And I'm a guy that's pretty much in control of myself most of the time.
[03:01:09.279 --> 03:01:13.321]  But when somebody calls my family out, it's just instinctive.
[03:01:13.321 --> 03:01:18.624]  But I should just say, man, why do you Democrats hate children so much and families?
[03:01:18.624 --> 03:01:19.984]  I forgive you.
[03:01:19.984 --> 03:01:20.805]  You need Christ.
[03:01:21.877 --> 03:01:22.598]  It really is true.
[03:01:22.598 --> 03:01:25.941]  But Barnes, what's wrong with the left today?
[03:01:25.941 --> 03:01:27.202]  Why do they hate families?
[03:01:27.202 --> 03:01:28.703]  Why do they hate children?
[03:01:28.703 --> 03:01:32.366]  Why do they not play by basic chivalry rules?
[03:01:32.366 --> 03:01:33.848]  Which, by the way, they're losing.
[03:01:33.848 --> 03:01:35.569]  I mean, they don't get chivalries there for a reason.
[03:01:35.569 --> 03:01:36.410]  What's wrong with them?
[03:01:37.668 --> 03:01:46.436]  It's sort of the curse of the collective, that when you lose yourself in some collective identity, you lose any respect for individuals, and particularly the most vulnerable individuals.
[03:01:46.436 --> 03:01:48.738]  And so I think that's part of the mentality and the mindset.
[03:01:48.738 --> 03:02:01.168]  That's why you have people making, like one of those horrific abortion videos, where they set up the video to say, oh, I'm going in to figure out whether it's a boy or a girl, and then they make fun of the fact that they got their child aborted, that that's the gender.
[03:02:02.129 --> 03:02:03.590]  So it's that kind of mindset.
[03:02:03.590 --> 03:02:05.772]  It's very sort of divorced from a certain deep humanism.
[03:02:05.772 --> 03:02:08.994]  And they go, this little bastard thinks he's about to have a life.
[03:02:08.994 --> 03:02:11.496]  No, I'm about to chop him up.
[03:02:11.496 --> 03:02:15.438]  They're making a sick joke off killing their own baby.
[03:02:15.438 --> 03:02:15.979]  Exactly.
[03:02:15.979 --> 03:02:23.404]  It's the sort of cognitive dissonance of and morally disturbing nature of people that are disconnected from humanism and humanity.
[03:02:23.404 --> 03:02:28.427]  And so it's no surprise that so many of that ideology flock to the tech world.
[03:02:29.245 --> 03:02:38.091]  It's a world that's sort of divorced and disconnected from individuals, from the basic principles and precepts of humanity, and don't care about the most vulnerable people around them.
[03:02:38.091 --> 03:02:50.080]  And instead, they sort of idolatrize power and become part of the collective notion and nature of ideas, and thus are drawn to things that always have a collective or status.
[03:02:50.080 --> 03:02:52.361]  And they know we have families, so they attack those.
[03:02:52.361 --> 03:02:52.942]  Great point.
[03:02:52.942 --> 03:02:54.243]  Patty in Texas, you're on the air.
[03:02:54.243 --> 03:02:54.523]  Go ahead.
[03:02:56.806 --> 03:02:58.347]  Hey Alex, how are you doing today?
[03:02:58.347 --> 03:02:58.567]  Good.
[03:02:58.567 --> 03:02:59.227]  We got two minutes.
[03:02:59.227 --> 03:02:59.868]  Thanks for holding.
[03:02:59.868 --> 03:03:00.288]  We love you.
[03:03:00.288 --> 03:03:02.609]  Go ahead.
[03:03:02.609 --> 03:03:12.454]  A couple of points I want to make about the coronavirus and where that's going to hit and how that's going to affect Trump.
[03:03:12.454 --> 03:03:21.739]  Over the last 20 years or so, the American businesses have fled from the United States to China, India, Mexico, that sort of thing.
[03:03:21.739 --> 03:03:24.641]  But a huge number of them landed in China.
[03:03:25.290 --> 03:03:30.193]  Well, with the virus hitting, all those companies are being shut down.
[03:03:30.193 --> 03:03:35.237]  So they're going to have to come back to the United States because of the destruction that's going on over there.
[03:03:35.237 --> 03:03:38.439]  Well, the Dems aren't going to like that.
[03:03:38.439 --> 03:03:42.181]  That's going to affect our economy and boost our economy.
[03:03:42.181 --> 03:03:49.466]  So what they're going to do with the virus is what I think they're going to do with the Democrats.
[03:03:49.466 --> 03:03:50.887]  They're going to do everything to push
[03:03:51.857 --> 03:04:01.641]  That virus to come into the United States and start destroying, killing people here in massive amounts in the same sort of way that's going on in China.
[03:04:01.641 --> 03:04:08.424]  That's going to affect, I think the timetable for that is this summer.
[03:04:08.424 --> 03:04:15.987]  I think they have it so they can figure out about how much, how this spreads, the rate that it spreads.
[03:04:15.987 --> 03:04:17.368]  And I bet that this summer,
[03:04:17.998 --> 03:04:23.421]  We're going to see an explosion of deaths of this virus here in the United States.
[03:04:23.421 --> 03:04:28.704]  So by the fall, they're going to have to call in martial law.
[03:04:28.704 --> 03:04:31.646]  All that's going to make Trump look like a chump.
[03:04:32.082 --> 03:04:35.866]  But he can't control things and he doesn't know what he's doing and that sort of thing.
[03:04:35.866 --> 03:04:36.287]  I agree.
[03:04:36.287 --> 03:04:38.630]  The biggest threat to Trump is crashing the economy.
[03:04:38.630 --> 03:04:39.551]  Thank you, Patty.
[03:04:39.551 --> 03:04:40.552]  Call me back tomorrow.
[03:04:40.552 --> 03:04:42.534]  Erin, Eric, Neil, Todd, I apologize.
[03:04:42.534 --> 03:04:43.075]  We're out of time.
[03:04:43.075 --> 03:04:44.897]  Had to do a lot of calls.
[03:04:44.897 --> 03:04:52.005]  I want to hear what Barnes wants to cover on the Democrats and more and what's coming up with these caucuses straight ahead.
[03:04:52.005 --> 03:04:52.866]  We'll be right back.
[03:04:54.198 --> 03:04:57.801]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:04:57.801 --> 03:04:59.582]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:04:59.582 --> 03:05:10.850]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:05:11.630 --> 03:05:20.817]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:05:20.817 --> 03:05:31.866]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:05:31.866 --> 03:05:34.488]  Pollen Block is natural and effective.
[03:05:34.488 --> 03:05:35.769]  It is not an antihistamine.
[03:05:36.189 --> 03:05:46.196]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:05:46.196 --> 03:05:48.838]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe!
[03:05:48.838 --> 03:05:53.541]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block chewable tablets.
[03:06:03.948 --> 03:06:05.650]  All right.
[03:06:05.650 --> 03:06:11.859]  Constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes is about to take over the next two segments of Darrell Celente's ready in the war room after that.
[03:06:15.476 --> 03:06:33.561]  I hope this virus isn't as bad as it looks like it is, but I just see providence at work again that we have the nano silver that it turns out in 2007 was certified by the Pentagon, by A&M, and Homeland Security letters to take out the SARS coronavirus family.
[03:06:34.964 --> 03:06:38.105]  I use it as immune gargle, so I can gargle it out, spit part of it out.
[03:06:38.105 --> 03:06:39.065]  You can drink part of it.
[03:06:39.065 --> 03:06:40.565]  You can drink it all if you want.
[03:06:40.565 --> 03:06:43.806]  It's at 15 parts per million, but it's a nano silver.
[03:06:43.806 --> 03:06:45.787]  We sold out of the 16 ounce.
[03:06:45.787 --> 03:06:50.288]  We're going to sell out of the 3 ounce and the 1 ounce very, very soon.
[03:06:50.288 --> 03:06:55.189]  And I'm going to keep it at 40% off, even though it's very close to selling out for another two days.
[03:06:56.459 --> 03:07:02.444]  But then it was pointed out to me that, oh, you're going to sell out of it at 40% off, even though we make like 30, 40% of that?
[03:07:02.444 --> 03:07:03.725]  We've got to buy more of it.
[03:07:03.725 --> 03:07:05.026]  I'm like, whoa.
[03:07:05.026 --> 03:07:12.953]  So it's going to go back to regular price by Wednesday or Thursday, and we'll still sell out of it long before we get more in.
[03:07:12.953 --> 03:07:13.933]  It'll take a month or more.
[03:07:13.933 --> 03:07:19.858]  Because I'm already putting in the order, and that takes money for the 16 ounce, the 3 ounce, the 1 ounce.
[03:07:19.858 --> 03:07:23.962]  Put the order in actually on Friday.
[03:07:23.962 --> 03:07:24.282]  Paid 50% down.
[03:07:26.434 --> 03:07:31.237]  They explained to me, they said, you understand at 40% off, we don't even make the money back reordering it.
[03:07:31.237 --> 03:07:33.519]  You have to have profit to fund things.
[03:07:33.519 --> 03:07:35.360]  I said, okay, you're right.
[03:07:35.360 --> 03:07:46.227]  I'll go till Wednesday at 40% off, and then for folks that get the last few thousand bottles at one ounce, and the last few bottles at three ounce, that'll help buy the next lot of it to even have it.
[03:07:46.227 --> 03:07:49.489]  So, InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLife.com, your
[03:07:50.796 --> 03:07:52.797]  I mean, gargle with nano silver.
[03:07:52.797 --> 03:07:55.039]  Also, their wound gel is even stronger.
[03:07:55.039 --> 03:07:58.882]  Don't ingest this same nano silver, but strongest over-the-counter you can find.
[03:07:58.882 --> 03:08:04.966]  And all of the super blue and super silver whitening toothpaste has the nano silver as well.
[03:08:04.966 --> 03:08:06.627]  It's just good for you overall.
[03:08:06.627 --> 03:08:07.548]  Really good for your body.
[03:08:07.548 --> 03:08:08.629]  Good for your gums.
[03:08:08.629 --> 03:08:10.070]  And it funds the InfoWar.
[03:08:10.070 --> 03:08:12.972]  And we're selling out of the storable food, but it's still available.
[03:08:12.972 --> 03:08:13.752]  You can still get it.
[03:08:13.752 --> 03:08:15.474]  But now time to take action.
[03:08:15.474 --> 03:08:16.694]  InfoWarStore.com.
[03:08:17.575 --> 03:08:18.055]  Or 888-253-3139.
[03:08:18.055 --> 03:08:24.358]  And again, most durable food companies are already sold out.
[03:08:24.358 --> 03:08:28.500]  We still have it at the same high quality, low prices.
[03:08:28.500 --> 03:08:29.800]  So that's how you fund the InfoWare.
[03:08:29.800 --> 03:08:31.541]  Get prepared, infowarestore.com.
[03:08:31.541 --> 03:08:36.964]  But whatever you do, please get prepared spiritually and get close to God because 2020 is one hell of a year.
[03:08:36.964 --> 03:08:43.907]  All right, for the balance of this segment, the next Robert Barnes takes over, constitutional lawyer, and then Gerald Cilente.
[03:08:43.907 --> 03:08:44.467]  Please stay with us.
[03:08:49.855 --> 03:08:59.849]  Hey, I think key parts as we look up to the New Hampshire primary elections coming up this tomorrow, the tomorrow evening, when we'll get the results back.
[03:08:59.849 --> 03:09:01.552]  There's multiple storylines at play.
[03:09:02.449 --> 03:09:11.435]  So most people focus on the horse race storyline or focused on who's going to win or who's going to get the nomination, who's going to be the potential opponent to President Trump.
[03:09:11.435 --> 03:09:14.377]  But there are other critical storylines equally in play.
[03:09:14.377 --> 03:09:22.562]  For example, there is everything that happened in Iowa and whether what happened in Iowa will effectively contaminate and infect the New Hampshire primary process.
[03:09:22.562 --> 03:09:26.765]  What happened in Iowa looks increasingly like corruption and fraud.
[03:09:26.765 --> 03:09:29.727]  It looks like an election that's been rigged by somebody.
[03:09:29.727 --> 03:09:32.109]  And the question only now is who and why?
[03:09:32.329 --> 03:09:32.415]  Yeah.
[03:09:32.662 --> 03:09:40.067]  The so one storyline will be to what degree does Pete Buttigieg, or however you pronounce his name, how well does he do in New Hampshire?
[03:09:40.067 --> 03:09:54.737]  Because before Iowa, before you got the fake news storyline of him coming in first, where it's now been confirmed that at least in terms of popular vote, he came in second in the first alignment and second in the second alignment, second by every form of popular vote that took place.
[03:09:54.737 --> 03:09:59.580]  And he himself propounds that he is a popular vote proponent for all elections.
[03:09:59.580 --> 03:10:02.402]  And yet here he took credit for an election where he lost the popular vote
[03:10:02.642 --> 03:10:04.464]  So that's one storyline taking place.
[03:10:16.443 --> 03:10:21.826]  A second storyline is taking place internally, whether or not Joe Biden will continue to collapse.
[03:10:21.826 --> 03:10:45.420]  For example, the if Biden cannot sustain any kind of momentum out of either Iowa or New Hampshire, and partially there again, there have been allegations and accusations that the reason why the caucus results were not reported accurately is because, partially because to help Buttigieg look like he won, but also for people to not know how badly Joe Biden did.
[03:10:45.840 --> 03:11:04.813]  Biden was collapsing he was falling through the floor and what's notable there in the in the context of Iowa is that you have not only what is happening in terms of the caucuses but just the weekend before the famous Iowa poll done by Ann Seltzer that was to be reported by the Des Moines Register and CNN
[03:11:06.403 --> 03:11:09.989]  What did that poll show?
[03:11:09.989 --> 03:11:16.698]  That poll showed Joe Biden collapsing, and it showed momentum for Elizabeth Warren rather than Pete Buttigieg, and what would that have meant?
[03:11:16.698 --> 03:11:21.125]  That may have meant the two establishment candidates, Biden and Buttigieg, would have been gone.
[03:11:21.525 --> 03:11:42.450]  So in order to get rid of that probability, so that Mayor Pete could look like a winner, so that he could have momentum that was fake momentum generated by the suppression of public opinion results, you had a second effect of that by suppressing the popular vote results to make it look like Mayor Pete had won, but instead it was likely Bernie Sanders who won.
[03:11:42.450 --> 03:11:44.331]  Now he gets to carry that into New Hampshire.
[03:11:44.771 --> 03:11:54.780]  And while in part, and in the suppression of the information about how poorly Joe Biden was doing, kept him afloat and alive in New Hampshire long enough maybe to survive.
[03:11:54.780 --> 03:11:56.441]  He might finish third.
[03:11:56.441 --> 03:11:58.744]  He might even finish, or at least in the top four.
[03:11:58.744 --> 03:12:01.226]  A fifth place finish would be a disaster.
[03:12:01.226 --> 03:12:03.207]  A finish with no delegates at all.
[03:12:04.600 --> 03:12:22.243]  And 15% is required to get any delegates out of New Hampshire would be a second hit, a second successive hit that may take away his momentum and the perception of front leading and front running that was necessary for him to get popular support given the lack of organic, authentic popular support.
[03:12:22.737 --> 03:12:33.603]  Remember, Joe Biden has run in two prior Democratic presidential campaigns and has never won any election in any of those presidential campaigns in the primary stage.
[03:12:33.603 --> 03:12:36.784]  So here again, he continues to lose and lose.
[03:12:36.784 --> 03:12:38.485]  What will happen in New Hampshire?
[03:12:38.485 --> 03:12:47.530]  Did Iowa's lack of reporting, did the suppression of the poll results, did the suppression of the caucus popular vote results save Joe Biden as well as boost
[03:12:48.150 --> 03:12:49.131]  Mayor Pete.
[03:12:49.131 --> 03:12:52.034]  Or as they call him in the Bernie camp, Mayor Cheat.
[03:12:52.034 --> 03:12:53.575]  Or Wall Street Pete.
[03:12:53.575 --> 03:12:56.158]  So those will be two key factors to be looking for.
[03:12:56.158 --> 03:13:02.404]  How much the corruption of what took place by the Democratic Party in Iowa has contaminated the New Hampshire results.
[03:13:02.404 --> 03:13:05.787]  And we'll know that only when those results come back in.
[03:13:06.508 --> 03:13:14.875]  The next thing to look at is the degree to which the various campaign attacks on Pete Buttigieg will undermine his success in New Hampshire.
[03:13:14.875 --> 03:13:24.583]  Will the corruption and collusion that took place in New Hampshire and Iowa not be enough to say to boost his campaign to electable status in New Hampshire?
[03:13:24.583 --> 03:13:29.267]  He really needs to win or at least finish a competitive second.
[03:13:29.267 --> 03:13:33.170]  If he is unable to do that, then his campaign may be over.
[03:13:33.690 --> 03:13:36.351]  Because he has a candidate with a very thin resume.
[03:13:36.351 --> 03:13:46.596]  The attack on him is one Trump is watching because Trump is going to replicate that attack if Mayor Pete, in fact, becomes a Democratic nominee.
[03:13:46.596 --> 03:13:51.578]  And that attack is making fun of the fact that he has had no experience doing anything of consequence.
[03:13:51.998 --> 03:13:59.924]  Unlike Trump who had built a global brand and a global business and a global TV network, you have someone like Buttigieg.
[03:13:59.924 --> 03:14:08.510]  All he's ever done is basically be a mayor of a small college town and by all appearances a failed mayor of a small college town.
[03:14:08.510 --> 03:14:16.256]  So you have someone who's never been a governor, he's never been a statewide elected official, he's never had major executive background either in the private sector or the public sector.
[03:14:16.676 --> 03:14:22.723]  In fact, his whole background reads like a tailor made, like somebody else was making him for a candidacy.
[03:14:22.723 --> 03:14:24.626]  He reads like Macron in France.
[03:14:24.626 --> 03:14:26.608]  He reads like Trudeau in Canada.
[03:14:26.608 --> 03:14:29.091]  He reads like Obama in here.
[03:14:29.091 --> 03:14:33.156]  Except with even weaker background proof and documents and information.
[03:14:33.636 --> 03:14:37.299]  He goes off that he's the son of a Gromsky scholar.
[03:14:37.299 --> 03:14:41.982]  Gromsky was a prominent far-left historian and analyst.
[03:14:41.982 --> 03:14:49.348]  He celebrated when he was younger, Bernie Sanders, as an ideal sort of cloak, mask, in disguise kind of candidate.
[03:14:49.348 --> 03:14:55.152]  How to be a far-left individual, a far-left statist, but disguise your far-left statism as something other than what it is.
[03:14:55.792 --> 03:15:12.316]  Uh, then he gets, uh, he gets a weird commission right into the army, uh, right into the armed forces without any basic training, without having to go through any sort of protocol that's has to, uh, when the only other people to achieve that benefit was Hunter Biden.
[03:15:12.316 --> 03:15:13.676]  Uh, is that coincidental?
[03:15:13.676 --> 03:15:16.657]  Appears to be connected to CIA spook operations in Afghanistan.
[03:15:16.657 --> 03:15:20.838]  And this is only real quote unquote military activity, uh, that has its own problematic
[03:15:23.121 --> 03:15:25.943]  He's the number one favorite candidate of the billionaires.
[03:15:25.943 --> 03:15:33.067]  They call him Wall Street Pete because half of his big billionaire donors are connected to Wall Street in an institutional and influential way.
[03:15:33.067 --> 03:15:35.828]  He has a lot of deep state ties.
[03:15:35.828 --> 03:15:39.350]  He was connected to the app that somehow went bad in Iowa.
[03:15:39.350 --> 03:15:42.752]  He's also connected to the app that may go bad in Nevada.
[03:15:42.752 --> 03:15:48.876]  So when we come back, we'll talk about how to interpret the New Hampshire results, but also looking forward to Nevada.
[03:15:48.876 --> 03:15:50.377]  If you think Iowa was corruption,
[03:15:51.081 --> 03:15:52.838]  Wait till you see the Nevada Caucuses.
[03:15:53.669 --> 03:15:56.690]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[03:15:56.690 --> 03:15:59.592]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?

[03:17:54.508 --> 03:18:06.200]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan hate InfoWars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[03:18:06.200 --> 03:18:15.008]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us, and they persecute us, and they lie about us.
[03:18:15.669 --> 03:18:20.231]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[03:18:20.231 --> 03:18:23.472]  The globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side.
[03:18:23.472 --> 03:18:26.174]  And they do what they do because they're slaves.
[03:18:26.174 --> 03:18:31.236]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[03:18:31.736 --> 03:18:41.662]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs, to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[03:18:41.662 --> 03:18:44.404]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[03:18:44.404 --> 03:18:46.986]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[03:18:46.986 --> 03:18:50.088]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[03:18:50.088 --> 03:18:53.510]  And that's all we ever have to know, is that God is in charge.
[03:18:55.646 --> 03:18:58.887]  This should really be easier than it is.
[03:18:58.887 --> 03:19:01.028]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[03:19:01.028 --> 03:19:03.509]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[03:19:03.509 --> 03:19:16.954]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work that if you listen to me and try them out for yourself you will see how amazing it is and then your support of the product we're selling will help you
[03:19:17.594 --> 03:19:17.694]  Yes.

[03:20:07.985 --> 03:20:08.605]  We're good.
[03:20:17.324 --> 03:20:20.246]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show here on InfoWars.
[03:20:20.246 --> 03:20:25.950]  We were discussing what to look forward to tomorrow in New Hampshire, how to translate and interpret the information and the results.
[03:20:25.950 --> 03:20:28.592]  Part of that's going to be, how does Bernie Sanders do?
[03:20:28.592 --> 03:20:33.135]  Has the Democratic establishment been able to take him out because of what happened in Iowa?
[03:20:33.135 --> 03:20:42.442]  It looks like they have been unsuccessful in doing so, but they may have their second backup strategy in play by having a diverse number of second and third and fourth and fifth
[03:20:42.782 --> 03:20:51.487]  Candidates who can be competitive long term to deny him a majority of the delegates that would allow for a contested convention in Milwaukee.
[03:20:51.487 --> 03:21:01.092]  And the last contested convention we had, meaningfully, really was 1968, where Hubert Humphrey came in after Robert Kennedy had been shot, killed.
[03:21:01.092 --> 03:21:09.037]  Hubert Humphrey came in and sort of swept up the contested convention, even though he had won very few primaries or votes in the primary process.
[03:21:10.064 --> 03:21:14.028]  Back then, most of the states did not participate in primaries or caucuses.
[03:21:14.028 --> 03:21:16.170]  So that's a relatively new phenomenon.
[03:21:16.170 --> 03:21:18.192]  That's a phenomenon since the 1980s.
[03:21:18.192 --> 03:21:29.103]  So in the modern era, since the 1980s, this would be the first ever contested convention where one person does not have a majority of delegates or close enough that everybody feels comfortable that they'll win the nomination.
[03:21:29.603 --> 03:21:34.387]  So if they're able, their stage one is to have Bernie lose tonight from the establishment's perspective.
[03:21:34.387 --> 03:21:41.393]  If not, their step two is to have him not win enough votes that he's on pace to win a majority of the delegates.
[03:21:41.393 --> 03:21:52.522]  To have enough second and third and fourth place candidates who get at least 15% of the vote to eat away at the delegate advantage that Bernie could establish and to maintain that as a momentum going forward.
[03:21:52.522 --> 03:21:54.964]  Also to try to deter his momentum moving forward.
[03:21:54.964 --> 03:21:56.506]  So we'll know a lot about what
[03:21:57.066 --> 03:22:00.969]  Uh, Iowa's corruption meant by what happens in New Hampshire tomorrow night.
[03:22:00.969 --> 03:22:13.357]  We'll also see to what degree the Deep State's favorite candidate, Pete, uh, Mayor Pete, or Pete Buttigieg, uh, as the, uh, the mayor of Bend, to what degree is, does he finish well?
[03:22:13.357 --> 03:22:16.099]  There were polls that showed him neck and neck with Bernie Sanders.
[03:22:16.099 --> 03:22:18.701]  Is he going to be there or is he going to fall substantially back?
[03:22:18.701 --> 03:22:24.865]  Those have been following the various, uh, electoral, uh, betting, uh, uh, advice and analysis that we've been providing here at InfoWars.
[03:22:24.865 --> 03:22:26.586]  They've made a lot of money since, uh, the summer.
[03:22:27.226 --> 03:22:32.169]  In terms of betting on Bernie when he was low, betting against Warren when she was high.
[03:22:32.169 --> 03:22:38.011]  And now the advice that we're making, or that I'm making, is if you're going to short somebody, short Bloomberg.
[03:22:38.011 --> 03:22:39.632]  He's overvalued in the polls.
[03:22:39.632 --> 03:22:47.036]  The Democratic Party will never allow Mike Bloomberg to steal the nomination.
[03:22:47.036 --> 03:22:49.597]  His corruption is not of a Hillary kind of corruption.
[03:22:49.597 --> 03:22:52.038]  He's an outsider trying to co-opt the Democratic Party.
[03:22:52.418 --> 03:22:57.841]  Both the insiders who want to protect their corruption and the outsiders who despise the billionaires.
[03:22:57.841 --> 03:23:04.224]  That coalition will stop and prevent Bloomberg from ever being nominated in the Democratic Party.
[03:23:04.224 --> 03:23:17.550]  So Mini-Me, he's actually like 5'3 or 5'4, that's why he said he used that Mini-Me box that President Trump mocked him for, that Scott Adams is going to start marketing the little Bloomberg box to make himself look taller.
[03:23:18.250 --> 03:23:25.716]  He's spending an unprecedented amount of money, but that's a lot like Jeb Bush in 2016, who spent over $100 million and went nowhere.
[03:23:25.716 --> 03:23:27.798]  So Bloomberg is likely to get votes.
[03:23:27.798 --> 03:23:28.698]  What is his objective?
[03:23:28.698 --> 03:23:29.779]  What is his goal?
[03:23:29.779 --> 03:23:39.927]  His goal is to get enough votes that he gets some delegates, that he crushes that 15% threshold in some voter-rich states, some delegate-rich states, so that he can become a kingmaker.
[03:23:39.927 --> 03:23:41.168]  Not to be the king.
[03:23:41.168 --> 03:23:44.871]  I think he knows he would love to be the king, but there's no chance that's ever going to happen.
[03:23:45.311 --> 03:23:51.693]  So instead what he's hoping for is enough power so that he can be a kingmaker and prevent Bernie from getting the nomination.
[03:23:51.693 --> 03:24:06.858]  So part of what watching New Hampshire tomorrow is seeing if enough people are eating into Bernie's vote that Bernie's under 30% and enough people get 15% because that would forecast and foreshadow that what's going to be happening is that Bloomberg will start getting 15%, Steyer will get 15% in some states,
[03:24:09.235 --> 03:24:14.740]  And we're looking at an increasing risk of a contested convention from the Democratic Party side.
[03:24:14.740 --> 03:24:20.966]  And that would be the first kind of its time in the modern era of national primaries and caucuses.
[03:24:20.966 --> 03:24:25.050]  The next thing to look at is who else does well in New Hampshire.
[03:24:25.050 --> 03:24:27.392]  Buttigieg needs to do well in order to survive.
[03:24:27.392 --> 03:24:29.894]  His base is an upscale white base.
[03:24:29.894 --> 03:24:32.917]  The key factor there that has hurt him and impaired his campaign
[03:24:33.377 --> 03:24:33.958]  We're good to go.
[03:24:49.935 --> 03:24:50.355]  We're good to go.
[03:25:11.624 --> 03:25:16.771]  That just documented the degree to which Mayor Pete has been Mayor Small.
[03:25:16.771 --> 03:25:21.337]  Not only physically, but in terms of his public policy record.
[03:25:21.337 --> 03:25:28.167]  What it showed is that, in fact, Bridge basically mocked him because the biggest achievement he had was putting decorative lights under the bridge.
[03:25:28.567 --> 03:25:29.147]  We're good to go.
[03:25:53.200 --> 03:25:53.480]  I think so.
[03:26:11.201 --> 03:26:26.100]  Or if he finishes even below second, then his campaign is likely effectively over in the Deep State's effort to co-opt and sneak a candidate into the Democratic Party establishment in the Trudeau, Macron, Obama style will have faltered and failed.
[03:26:26.100 --> 03:26:27.502]  And that will be good news for everybody.
[03:26:27.990 --> 03:26:31.472]  The other factor is, will Joe Biden's collapse continue?
[03:26:31.472 --> 03:26:35.495]  From the Trump side of the equation, they want Biden out.
[03:26:35.495 --> 03:26:37.116]  They really don't necessarily want someone like Bernie.
[03:26:37.116 --> 03:26:43.800]  They want a contested convention that leads to a Hillary or Elizabeth Warren kind of compromise candidate.
[03:26:43.800 --> 03:26:45.661]  That's what they want to have happen.
[03:26:45.661 --> 03:26:49.444]  They don't mind if they face Bloomberg, but they don't think that's a realistic risk.
[03:26:49.444 --> 03:26:52.966]  They don't mind if they face Tom Steyer, but they don't think that's a realistic risk.
[03:26:53.607 --> 03:26:54.187]  I don't know.
[03:27:10.110 --> 03:27:16.353]  A concern over Bernie Sanders is that Bernie Sanders voters, a lot of them are Bernie or bust voters.
[03:27:16.353 --> 03:27:21.675]  That if Bernie is not the nominee, there's a bunch of people that will not even vote or will vote third party.
[03:27:21.675 --> 03:27:28.918]  And that's why what the ideal scenario for Trump is a contested convention that rigs the election against Bernie again.
[03:27:28.918 --> 03:27:35.801]  That's why you're seeing that mantra come out from Trump, from Trump Jr., from Steve Bannon, from other participants in the Trump universe.
[03:27:35.801 --> 03:27:38.142]  Their ideal scenario is that Bernie gets shafted again.
[03:27:39.683 --> 03:27:42.885]  So that will be another interesting dynamic to watch and observe.
[03:27:42.885 --> 03:27:48.548]  And all of this is leading to the next set of elections, and that's going to be in the caucuses in the state of Nevada.
[03:27:48.548 --> 03:27:50.510]  So again, you have caucuses.
[03:27:50.510 --> 03:27:52.451]  And then, and this time, who do you have?
[03:27:52.451 --> 03:27:54.132]  You have Nevada.
[03:27:54.132 --> 03:27:59.175]  Now, Nevada is to Iowa what Chicago is to New York.
[03:27:59.773 --> 03:28:09.683]  So that is to say that the Iowa caucuses are an embarrassment of apparent collusion and corruption this time around, arguably in 2016 and some past elections too.
[03:28:10.894 --> 03:28:18.601]  Uh, but that pales in comparison to Nevada, in the same way that whatever New York's political corruption pales in comparison to the city of Chicago.
[03:28:18.601 --> 03:28:21.484]  Some of the same connect, they're going to use an app there, but a different app.
[03:28:21.484 --> 03:28:30.673]  They're just going to use an iPad structure, but the person connected to the security apparatus of it is also connected to Pete Buttigieg's campaign, also has sort of deep state ties.
[03:28:31.393 --> 03:28:36.498]  Of course, Harry Reid's political machine, despite him being retired, still very influential.
[03:28:36.498 --> 03:28:43.044]  So whatever you see, Iowa was just a small preview of what you're going to see in Nevada in a couple of weeks.
[03:28:43.044 --> 03:28:51.532]  So up next, Gerald will be taking over for us, and we'll take you through for the next half hour, and we'll look forward to seeing you soon.
[03:28:51.532 --> 03:28:51.693]  Thanks.
[03:28:53.576 --> 03:28:56.618]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?

[03:30:15.647 --> 03:30:17.508]  Do not do it.
[03:30:17.508 --> 03:30:19.089]  Trust CNN.
[03:30:19.089 --> 03:30:19.609]  Trust MSNBC.

[03:30:32.237 --> 03:30:34.019]  Hug the cobra.
[03:30:34.019 --> 03:30:35.800]  Love the cobra.
[03:30:35.800 --> 03:30:37.281]  Kiss the cobra.
[03:30:37.281 --> 03:30:45.046]  But never, never go to InfoWars.com or InfoWarsStore.com!
[03:30:45.046 --> 03:30:47.968]  Do not order those products!
[03:30:47.968 --> 03:30:49.509]  Silence Jones!
[03:30:54.363 --> 03:30:58.505]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers of InfoWars.
[03:30:58.505 --> 03:31:08.888]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana as a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S., but worldwide.
[03:31:08.888 --> 03:31:15.711]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[03:31:16.411 --> 03:31:26.165]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that and some other areas, but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[03:31:26.165 --> 03:31:28.868]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever.
[03:31:29.721 --> 03:31:34.885]  We really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[03:31:34.885 --> 03:31:39.848]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[03:31:39.848 --> 03:31:42.210]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[03:31:42.210 --> 03:31:47.993]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[03:31:47.993 --> 03:31:49.995]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[03:31:49.995 --> 03:31:53.077]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[03:31:54.349 --> 03:31:55.109]  Well, it's here.
[03:31:55.109 --> 03:31:56.050]  The year 2020.
[03:31:56.050 --> 03:31:58.031]  World governments out in the open.
[03:31:58.031 --> 03:32:02.474]  We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're calling for global government as the answer.
[03:32:02.474 --> 03:32:16.323]  And we've got massive, huge censorship taking place that's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn.
[03:32:16.323 --> 03:32:16.503]  Wow!
[03:32:17.103 --> 03:32:18.605]  Yes, now we know we're right.
[03:32:18.605 --> 03:32:19.906]  The New World Order's real.
[03:32:19.906 --> 03:32:20.967]  Satanism's real.
[03:32:20.967 --> 03:32:22.308]  The pedophile elite are real.
[03:32:22.308 --> 03:32:26.132]  But we're real as well, and we love God, and we're standing up and saying no.
[03:32:26.132 --> 03:32:30.897]  But I just want to make the point here, one month into 2020, that we have never been in Kansas.
[03:32:30.897 --> 03:32:34.460]  We have never been in some Smallville place that didn't matter.
[03:32:34.460 --> 03:32:38.765]  Everything we do, every decision we make, governs the future of our species.
[03:32:39.045 --> 03:32:41.406]  And everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[03:32:41.406 --> 03:32:42.806]  So it's an incredible time to be alive.
[03:32:42.806 --> 03:32:45.747]  I want to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[03:32:45.747 --> 03:32:52.909]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth, and financial support of importrestore.com is critical.
[03:32:52.909 --> 03:32:57.330]  So please take action.
[03:32:57.330 --> 03:32:59.971]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:16.068 --> 03:33:19.451]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:19.451 --> 03:33:26.416]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:33:26.416 --> 03:33:27.657]  Hello, hello.
[03:33:27.657 --> 03:33:31.720]  Great being on The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:31.720 --> 03:33:32.361]  Wow.
[03:33:32.361 --> 03:33:33.682]  Wild ride this 2020, huh?
[03:33:33.682 --> 03:33:39.986]  Well, we got the big news, of course, is coronavirus.
[03:33:39.986 --> 03:33:41.648]  Goodbye, Rosie.
[03:33:41.648 --> 03:33:43.409]  We need a corona.
[03:33:43.409 --> 03:33:44.550]  Thousand people dead.
[03:33:45.513 --> 03:33:47.295]  Boy, it's really hurting China.
[03:33:47.295 --> 03:33:49.937]  Their economy is going way down.
[03:33:49.937 --> 03:33:52.119]  It's stagnant already.
[03:33:52.119 --> 03:33:52.899]  That's stagnant.
[03:33:52.899 --> 03:33:57.744]  They're still growing at over 6%, at least according to their reports.
[03:33:57.744 --> 03:34:06.631]  But a thousand people, again, I look at this as, you know, it's not a lot of people in a population of the world of 7.7 billion.
[03:34:10.979 --> 03:34:18.306]  Again, according to most of the reports, the people that are dying are chronically ill, or they're elderly.
[03:34:18.306 --> 03:34:22.610]  So, you know, what did we have last year in the United States?
[03:34:22.610 --> 03:34:26.414]  Over 60,000 people died of the flu.
[03:34:26.414 --> 03:34:29.677]  But this is definitely hurting their economy.
[03:34:29.677 --> 03:34:35.463]  And one of the things to look at, again, as you know, I'm forecasting the greatest depression.
[03:34:36.874 --> 03:34:43.196]  This is a kind of black swan event that could escalate things to make bad situations very worse.
[03:34:43.196 --> 03:34:45.397]  So let's take a look at the oil.
[03:34:45.397 --> 03:34:52.260]  Brent crude now is around $53, $54 a barrel.
[03:34:52.260 --> 03:35:01.703]  At the beginning of January, which is in ancient history, it hit $70 a barrel.
[03:35:01.703 --> 03:35:03.204]  I'm mentioning this because
[03:35:05.071 --> 03:35:09.975]  All of these oil-exporting countries, they need that oil price to go higher.
[03:35:09.975 --> 03:35:11.816]  Particularly Saudi Arabia.
[03:35:11.816 --> 03:35:15.078]  They're the beheaders-in-chief.
[03:35:15.078 --> 03:35:20.682]  They need oil at about $100 a barrel for its economy to break even.
[03:35:20.682 --> 03:35:23.384]  So they're about halfway there.
[03:35:23.384 --> 03:35:27.387]  When all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:35:27.387 --> 03:35:29.529]  And it's not only oil.
[03:35:29.529 --> 03:35:31.750]  You're looking at natural gas prices.
[03:35:31.750 --> 03:35:33.291]  Way, way down, under $2.
[03:35:36.044 --> 03:35:38.665]  So, this is signaling a global slowdown.
[03:35:38.665 --> 03:35:43.107]  There's too much supply and not enough demand.
[03:35:43.107 --> 03:35:47.589]  So, I believe, again, the coronavirus, and I could be 100% wrong.
[03:35:47.589 --> 03:35:51.271]  I'm not, you know, saying that I'm right and they're wrong.
[03:35:51.271 --> 03:35:56.273]  I'm saying the way I see it, they're making a bigger deal out of this than it is.
[03:35:56.273 --> 03:36:00.595]  And, of course, people say the Chinese government lying about the numbers.
[03:36:00.595 --> 03:36:02.396]  All the governments lie about everything.
[03:36:02.396 --> 03:36:03.216]  Name the country.
[03:36:04.403 --> 03:36:08.325]  Yeah, Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and ties to Al Qaeda.
[03:36:08.325 --> 03:36:09.925]  Yeah, that guy's Soleimani.
[03:36:09.925 --> 03:36:13.887]  He was going to... We had evidence that... imminent threat.
[03:36:13.887 --> 03:36:14.808]  Could you show me any?
[03:36:14.808 --> 03:36:15.628]  No, who the hell are you?
[03:36:15.628 --> 03:36:17.789]  I don't have to show you anything.
[03:36:17.789 --> 03:36:29.454]  So, when you're looking again at this coronavirus and what's going on, it's really hurting the Chinese economy.
[03:36:29.454 --> 03:36:33.976]  And it's going to slow down the global economy, which is already in slowdown.
[03:36:35.555 --> 03:36:46.403]  You know, everybody wearing all these masks and all of this gear, you know, as things get really bad, we really do get hit with the plague of the new black plague.
[03:36:46.403 --> 03:36:54.510]  I could see everybody dressed like that, you know, making fashion statements, how we should all do this style and masks.
[03:36:54.510 --> 03:36:58.673]  And again, you look at the realities going on.
[03:36:58.673 --> 03:37:02.636]  Here's a story from last week's February 5th.
[03:37:02.636 --> 03:37:05.258]  Tainted tap water puts suburbs on edge.
[03:37:05.933 --> 03:37:09.374]  This is from the Wall Street Journal.
[03:37:09.374 --> 03:37:26.498]  About 80,000 people in three townships outside Philadelphia live in an area where groundwater has been contaminated by chemicals used for decades in firefighting foam at two nearby decommissioned military bases.
[03:37:26.498 --> 03:37:34.740]  The Defense Department has cited 401 bases in the United States with a known suspected release
[03:37:35.987 --> 03:37:51.294]  Of the firefighting foam containing chemicals known as Perfluoroacoloblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblahblah or PFAS.
[03:37:51.294 --> 03:38:03.460]  PFAS are a class of nearly 5,000 chemicals often called forever chemicals because they forever keep poisoning us.
[03:38:05.339 --> 03:38:23.003]  Because they take so long to break down PFAS can accumulate in the body in several forms have been linked to health issues, including increased cholesterol, thyroid and immune system problems and cancer.
[03:38:23.003 --> 03:38:33.905]  And they use this stuff besides the military bases manufacturers used in products from nonstick cookware to carpets and waterproof jackets and on and on.
[03:38:34.778 --> 03:38:37.419]  So we're talking about the coronavirus.
[03:38:37.419 --> 03:38:42.281]  How about all the poisons they're pumping into our body?
[03:38:42.281 --> 03:38:43.822]  In our water.
[03:38:43.822 --> 03:38:46.983]  In our air.
[03:38:46.983 --> 03:38:48.364]  In the soil.
[03:38:48.364 --> 03:38:55.567]  And by the way, this is why you should consider buying oil, water filters.
[03:38:55.567 --> 03:39:00.889]  Because this stuff is deadly and it's everywhere and it's more than just this.
[03:39:00.889 --> 03:39:03.970]  So again, as I say, you know, people talking about, you know,
[03:39:05.155 --> 03:39:07.397]  Climate.
[03:39:07.397 --> 03:39:09.718]  Climate change.
[03:39:09.718 --> 03:39:14.821]  We're going to be dead before the climate changes with all the poisons they're pumping into us.
[03:39:14.821 --> 03:39:23.046]  But going back again and putting all the pieces together, the coronavirus is going to take a hit on the global economy.
[03:39:23.046 --> 03:39:27.529]  The global economy is slowing down and very important.
[03:39:27.529 --> 03:39:31.251]  The dollar is getting stronger.
[03:39:31.251 --> 03:39:33.893]  More and more countries are lowering their
[03:39:34.935 --> 03:39:36.236]  Interest rates.
[03:39:36.236 --> 03:39:42.719]  Matter of fact, last week, Thailand, right near China over there, they're losing a lot of tourists coming in.
[03:39:42.719 --> 03:39:47.001]  They just lower their interest rates to historic loads.
[03:39:47.001 --> 03:39:54.065]  The Chinese government is pumping in hundreds of billions of dollars to try to pump their economy back up.
[03:39:54.065 --> 03:39:56.386]  So now we have the dollar stronger.
[03:39:56.386 --> 03:40:00.588]  And again, it came on that jobs report last week that pushed it up higher.
[03:40:01.823 --> 03:40:06.945]  This is important because gold is still going up.
[03:40:06.945 --> 03:40:15.209]  Gold usually goes down when the dollar goes up because gold is dollar based.
[03:40:15.209 --> 03:40:18.330]  You got to pay for it all around the world in dollars.
[03:40:18.330 --> 03:40:25.873]  So now all these currencies are going down because they're lowering interest rates to boost their economy.
[03:40:25.873 --> 03:40:28.174]  So it costs them more to buy gold.
[03:40:28.174 --> 03:40:30.935]  But even with that, gold prices are going up.
[03:40:32.523 --> 03:40:34.425]  This is very important to look at.
[03:40:34.425 --> 03:40:41.131]  It should be going down now because of the strong dollar.
[03:40:41.131 --> 03:40:51.780]  So I believe that gold right now is in a very critical stage, breaking over that one thousand five hundred and seventy mark.
[03:40:51.780 --> 03:40:58.486]  If it solidifies over one thousand six hundred and ten dollars an ounce in the very near future,
[03:40:59.341 --> 03:41:04.564]  I forecast is going to take at least another hundred dollars spike.
[03:41:04.564 --> 03:41:13.570]  And if you go back to our trends journal, the trend alert we sent out last September, September 6th, to be exact.
[03:41:13.570 --> 03:41:16.152]  The gold bull run has begun.
[03:41:16.152 --> 03:41:19.674]  Gold is at one thousand three hundred and thirty two dollars an ounce.
[03:41:19.674 --> 03:41:25.418]  As I mentioned right now, it's above one thousand five hundred and seventy dollars an ounce.
[03:41:25.418 --> 03:41:28.040]  This is telling you what's going on around the world.
[03:41:29.654 --> 03:41:31.175]  And.
[03:41:31.175 --> 03:41:35.018]  It's a shaky situation.
[03:41:35.018 --> 03:41:37.320]  You're going to start seeing auto sales going.
[03:41:37.320 --> 03:41:39.182]  The auto sales have been tanking.
[03:41:39.182 --> 03:41:41.043]  They've been going down all around the world.
[03:41:41.043 --> 03:41:45.647]  That's a big indicator before the corona virus.
[03:41:45.647 --> 03:41:56.496]  Way before the corona virus in China, in India, in Europe and in the United States, sales are going down because autos are the second thing you buy after
[03:41:56.889 --> 03:42:00.752]  You could afford buying a house and your rent.
[03:42:00.752 --> 03:42:01.732]  You buy a car.
[03:42:01.732 --> 03:42:03.714]  You can't afford it right now.
[03:42:03.714 --> 03:42:10.819]  This is a very important indicator of what's going on and what to watch out for.
[03:42:10.819 --> 03:42:13.861]  So we have a global slowdown.
[03:42:13.861 --> 03:42:17.723]  The coronavirus is going to make it much worse.
[03:42:17.723 --> 03:42:21.786]  And is war tensions heating up?
[03:42:21.786 --> 03:42:23.407]  Where are they heating up?
[03:42:23.407 --> 03:42:25.989]  They're not only heating up more
[03:42:26.707 --> 03:42:35.375]  As we see it, over in the Middle East, but also in Venezuela.
[03:42:35.375 --> 03:42:39.598]  And not happy about some things that are going on there.
[03:42:39.598 --> 03:42:42.821]  And we're going to talk more about it when we come back.
[03:42:42.821 --> 03:42:45.544]  Because people better prepare for the worst.
[03:42:45.544 --> 03:42:48.766]  If the worst doesn't happen, you didn't lose anything.
[03:42:48.766 --> 03:42:50.808]  If you don't prepare, you could lose everything.
[03:42:50.808 --> 03:42:51.529]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:53.328 --> 03:42:58.091]  There's a new way to show your support for the InfoWars crew at InfoWarsStore.com.

[03:43:23.129 --> 03:43:26.972]  Since the beginning, Secret 12 has been one of our most popular formulas.

[03:43:52.972 --> 03:43:54.153]  Don't be a victim.
[03:43:54.153 --> 03:43:59.017]  If you're worried about the coronavirus, exercise, but not too hard because that can lower your immune system.
[03:43:59.017 --> 03:44:03.280]  Drink extra purified clean water so that no toxins weigh you down, but you have plenty of hydration.
[03:44:03.280 --> 03:44:05.702]  Prayer and meditation has been proven to make you healthier.
[03:44:05.702 --> 03:44:09.145]  Get plenty of vitamin C. Get plenty of vitamin D3, which is fish oil.
[03:44:09.145 --> 03:44:10.826]  Take your colloidal silver, all of it.
[03:44:10.826 --> 03:44:14.449]  That's what allows you to be healthier and get plenty of sleep.
[03:44:14.449 --> 03:44:17.852]  We have sold out of the 16 ounce immune gargle that has the nano
[03:44:18.132 --> 03:44:19.134]  We're good to go.
[03:44:34.575 --> 03:44:37.236]  We also have a super silver in our whitening toothpaste.
[03:44:37.236 --> 03:44:42.258]  Again, we're the only folks allowed to private label or make our own products with this top nanotech company based here in the U.S.
[03:44:42.258 --> 03:44:45.639]  It's in all these Homeland Security documents and everything because we get the best stuff.
[03:44:45.639 --> 03:44:46.880]  There's a lot of patriots.
[03:44:46.880 --> 03:44:48.480]  There's not just bad guys coming after us.
[03:44:48.480 --> 03:44:51.462]  There's a flip side of all the good guys and good gals.
[03:44:51.462 --> 03:44:52.202]  It's very exciting.
[03:44:54.147 --> 03:44:59.973]  I wanted to talk about Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[03:44:59.973 --> 03:45:03.536]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[03:45:03.536 --> 03:45:05.838]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[03:45:05.838 --> 03:45:07.660]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[03:45:07.660 --> 03:45:15.247]  So here I am telling people Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[03:45:15.247 --> 03:45:15.707]  And I'm 45 years old.
[03:45:16.468 --> 03:45:18.469]  And I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:20.149]  And it's fluoride free.
[03:45:20.149 --> 03:45:23.411]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the Coral Calcium.
[03:45:23.411 --> 03:45:27.012]  Because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean.
[03:45:27.012 --> 03:45:31.674]  And the toothpaste, I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[03:45:31.674 --> 03:45:32.974]  It feels so good.
[03:45:32.974 --> 03:45:37.116]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[03:45:37.116 --> 03:45:43.318]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now.
[03:45:43.318 --> 03:45:44.979]  Because I like the way it feels.
[03:45:54.258 --> 03:45:58.321]  Almost all the other big storable food companies are sold out of food.
[03:45:58.321 --> 03:46:01.364]  But I know for a fact from sources, they're telling people, oh, we've got it.
[03:46:01.364 --> 03:46:03.826]  Get your order in two weeks for delivery.
[03:46:03.826 --> 03:46:05.667]  We follow this pattern over and over again.
[03:46:05.667 --> 03:46:06.968]  I've been on radio for 25 years.
[03:46:06.968 --> 03:46:09.490]  I've had storable food for a long time.
[03:46:09.490 --> 03:46:13.393]  And I learned very quickly, a lot of these companies, they're fine during normal times.
[03:46:13.393 --> 03:46:16.956]  But during a crisis, they don't keep a bunch of food on hand because of inventory.
[03:46:16.956 --> 03:46:17.937]  They'll still take your orders.
[03:46:18.157 --> 03:46:33.187]  That's why about 11 years ago I found My Patriot Supply, now the biggest, most trusted company out there, and I became a private labeler for them, because they actually have it on hand, they actually give it delivered to you on time, they do what they're going to say they're going to do, because they want you as a customer over and over again, and they're good people.
[03:46:33.187 --> 03:46:38.091]  Now, they were saying 7 to 10 days before shipping, because they've got the food, but they've got to package it record-level orders.
[03:46:38.391 --> 03:46:43.153]  Now it's 10 to 14 because it's only intensifying with the coronavirus.
[03:46:43.153 --> 03:46:45.134]  So get your orders at InfoWarsaw.com.
[03:46:45.134 --> 03:46:46.135]  Get the best deals.
[03:46:46.135 --> 03:46:47.235]  Get it delivered first.
[03:46:47.235 --> 03:46:48.076]  They're in our system.
[03:46:48.076 --> 03:46:49.076]  It goes right to them.
[03:46:49.076 --> 03:46:50.457]  Then it funds the Infor as well.
[03:46:50.457 --> 03:46:51.217]  So get prepared.
[03:46:51.217 --> 03:46:57.240]  InfoWarsaw.com with Sorible Foods.
[03:46:57.240 --> 03:46:59.842]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:14.179 --> 03:47:16.580]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:47:16.580 --> 03:47:19.242]  It's Gerald Celente.
[03:47:19.242 --> 03:47:23.104]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:23.104 --> 03:47:26.026]  Hello, hello.
[03:47:26.026 --> 03:47:28.888]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:28.888 --> 03:47:32.710]  I remember when I was just reading to you about all this pollution in the water.
[03:47:33.496 --> 03:47:44.959]  And again, why it's important for you to consider getting equipment and what you need to protect yourself and your family from all the poisons that they're pumping into our system.
[03:47:44.959 --> 03:47:49.941]  And of course, InfoWars has a lot of those products that can help you survive.
[03:47:49.941 --> 03:47:56.102]  I was talking, first of all, about the slowdown in the global economy.
[03:47:56.102 --> 03:48:00.544]  And again, this precedes what's going on with
[03:48:02.574 --> 03:48:04.395]  Coronavirus.
[03:48:04.395 --> 03:48:08.338]  The last quarter of 2019, you know what the growth in Europe was?
[03:48:08.338 --> 03:48:12.220]  0.1%.
[03:48:12.220 --> 03:48:14.642]  Like, how about no growth at all?
[03:48:14.642 --> 03:48:15.783]  So now the news.
[03:48:15.783 --> 03:48:17.124]  Mnuchin and Lagarde.
[03:48:17.124 --> 03:48:18.645]  Mnuchin, of course, is our U.S.
[03:48:18.645 --> 03:48:19.245]  Secretary.
[03:48:19.245 --> 03:48:23.408]  And Lagarde is the head of the European Central Bank.
[03:48:23.408 --> 03:48:27.971]  Used to be the head of the International Mafia, excuse me, Monetary Fund.
[03:48:27.971 --> 03:48:32.374]  And now they moved her to another criminal group over there.
[03:48:33.303 --> 03:48:33.563]  U.S.
[03:48:33.563 --> 03:48:36.705]  Secretary of State Steven Mnuchin warned the U.S.
[03:48:36.705 --> 03:48:48.032]  economy would probably not reach 3% growth rate this year, predicted by the Trump administration, citing Boeing's 737 Maxwell's and coronavirus outbreak.
[03:48:48.032 --> 03:48:49.373]  That's BS.
[03:48:49.373 --> 03:48:52.795]  There's nothing to do with Boeing, nothing to do with coronavirus.
[03:48:52.795 --> 03:48:54.456]  It's a global slowdown.
[03:48:54.456 --> 03:49:01.480]  We only saw 2.3% growth last year and had nothing to do with coronavirus.
[03:49:01.480 --> 03:49:01.640]  So.
[03:49:03.052 --> 03:49:28.219]  I want to pick up just a little bit where Mr. Barnes was speaking before I got on, and he did a wonderful job there in showing the criminal dummo-craps, or both parties to me, repulsive kids and dummo-craps, how they're rigging the election trying to bring down Sanders and put in that CIA boy, Buttigieg, or whatever his name is, Buddha this, Butta that, you know, who knows.
[03:49:28.219 --> 03:49:29.700]  But, but, but, but.
[03:49:32.864 --> 03:49:40.747]  I like reading the news after this stuff comes out after the election in Iowa.
[03:49:40.747 --> 03:49:44.669]  And it's very important, too, because Iowa used to be a big thing.
[03:49:44.669 --> 03:49:45.869]  You know, oh, the Iowa vote.
[03:49:45.869 --> 03:49:47.050]  Oh, now who's ever going to win?
[03:49:47.050 --> 03:49:49.210]  That one's going to be next.
[03:49:49.210 --> 03:49:51.251]  How Iowa got away from Biden.
[03:49:51.251 --> 03:49:58.554]  Big story here in the Wall Street Journal.
[03:49:58.554 --> 03:50:01.035]  How Iowa got away from Biden.
[03:50:02.298 --> 03:50:04.480]  How could anything stay with Biden?
[03:50:04.480 --> 03:50:07.142]  The guy's a crazy, stupid loser.
[03:50:07.142 --> 03:50:14.068]  An arrogant boy who's been sucking off the public you-know-what his entire life.
[03:50:14.068 --> 03:50:18.172]  Never worked a day in his life.
[03:50:18.172 --> 03:50:19.413]  Arrogant.
[03:50:19.413 --> 03:50:23.516]  Oh, and he gave his boy, Hunter Thompson, all those... Hunter Thompson.
[03:50:23.516 --> 03:50:27.139]  Excuse me, Mr. Thompson, for being disrespectful.
[03:50:27.139 --> 03:50:27.900]  Hunter Biden.
[03:50:29.048 --> 03:50:32.010]  He got that gig in Ukraine.
[03:50:32.010 --> 03:50:34.592]  Can't speak a word of the lingo.
[03:50:34.592 --> 03:50:44.558]  Doesn't know anything about the energy business, but he got, what, $50,000 a month to sit on the board of directors of Burisma Energy.
[03:50:44.558 --> 03:50:46.899]  So anyway, how did Biden lose?
[03:50:46.899 --> 03:50:48.920]  Then again, another one.
[03:50:48.920 --> 03:50:53.403]  Bloomberg boosts spending and staffing.
[03:50:53.403 --> 03:50:53.904]  B.S.
[03:50:53.904 --> 03:50:54.544]  Bloomberg.
[03:50:55.267 --> 03:51:03.912]  Has spent over 300 million dollars already.
[03:51:03.912 --> 03:51:11.396]  So when people talk about the great democracy of America saving.
[03:51:11.396 --> 03:51:13.377]  You gotta be in it to win it.
[03:51:13.377 --> 03:51:16.119]  And to be in it you gotta have a lot of dough these days.
[03:51:16.119 --> 03:51:20.642]  Or you gotta be a shill like Butter Gig.
[03:51:20.642 --> 03:51:22.963]  Who's being propped up the deep state boy.
[03:51:25.885 --> 03:51:27.866]  You or I want to run, we go nowhere.
[03:51:27.866 --> 03:51:40.909]  And that other guy, that other Democratic guy, it was Civer, Steve, or whatever his name is, another multi-multi-millionaire, billionaire guy.
[03:51:40.909 --> 03:51:44.090]  So the whole game is rigged.
[03:51:44.090 --> 03:51:48.431]  And then this one over here, another funny story to me.
[03:51:48.431 --> 03:51:53.813]  Shaken by Trump's acquittal, Democrats ask, what do we do next?
[03:51:53.813 --> 03:51:55.013]  What do you mean, what do you do next?
[03:51:56.786 --> 03:52:00.568]  It's a freak show.
[03:52:00.568 --> 03:52:05.391]  Bunch of disgusting human beings running.
[03:52:05.391 --> 03:52:06.292]  Bernie Sanders.
[03:52:06.292 --> 03:52:07.152]  Two-faced Bernie.
[03:52:07.152 --> 03:52:09.794]  You know the guy that never worked a day in his life either.
[03:52:09.794 --> 03:52:11.255]  Playing Mr. Important.
[03:52:11.255 --> 03:52:16.278]  Flip-flopping back and forth when, you know, it appeals to him to do it.
[03:52:16.278 --> 03:52:18.699]  You know, to get the votes.
[03:52:18.699 --> 03:52:23.102]  This guy supported, you know, I voted against the Iraq War.
[03:52:25.560 --> 03:52:27.862]  Yeah, you voted against the Iraq War?
[03:52:27.862 --> 03:52:41.432]  You voted when you were a congressman to support murderous Bill Clinton sanctions on Iraq that killed over 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five.
[03:52:41.432 --> 03:52:44.935]  And you remember Madeleine Not All That Bright?
[03:52:44.935 --> 03:52:51.420]  Yeah, our UN ambassador to the United Nations telling Leslie Stahl on 60 Minutes,
[03:52:52.409 --> 03:52:58.893]  If the price of the death of 500,000 Iraqi children under the age of five was worth the sanctions?
[03:52:58.893 --> 03:53:02.576]  And she said, yes it was.
[03:53:02.576 --> 03:53:03.296]  Funny story.
[03:53:03.296 --> 03:53:07.579]  I did a gig on the QE2 back in 2002.
[03:53:07.579 --> 03:53:10.961]  And I was the second day keynote speaker.
[03:53:10.961 --> 03:53:12.742]  She was the first.
[03:53:12.742 --> 03:53:14.703]  What a trip.
[03:53:14.703 --> 03:53:17.465]  15 minute introduction with her.
[03:53:17.465 --> 03:53:19.126]  15 minutes.
[03:53:19.126 --> 03:53:20.107]  It went on and on.
[03:53:21.138 --> 03:53:25.379]  She looks like the Queen of Tarts, all dressed up in red.
[03:53:25.379 --> 03:53:38.863]  Next day they introduce me, Mr. Salenti, you know, author of Trends, Trend Tracking, Far Better Than Megatrends, Trends 2000, international best-selling book, publisher of the Trends Journal magazine, world leader in trend forecasting, blah, blah, blah.
[03:53:38.863 --> 03:53:45.445]  So the guy after, you know, these are all top marketing executives from around the world.
[03:53:45.445 --> 03:53:47.165]  It was a cruise we went on in the QE2.
[03:53:49.758 --> 03:53:52.621]  And I'm the second, next day, the keynote speaker.
[03:53:52.621 --> 03:53:55.585]  And I said, thank you very much for that introduction.
[03:53:55.585 --> 03:54:04.175]  I said, however, after hearing Miss Albright's introduction, I said, I feel like I was shortchanged.
[03:54:04.175 --> 03:54:06.077]  And the crowd broke up laughing.
[03:54:06.644 --> 03:54:18.160]  And I said, because they went on, Madeleine Albright grew up in Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic, she had honors in this, her father did that, her mother did this, she went to this school, that school, honors in this, honors in that, honors in this, honors in that.
[03:54:18.160 --> 03:54:22.165]  I said, what you also failed to mention is that I went to PS-76.
[03:54:23.800 --> 03:54:26.981]  And graduated without honors, you know, so I brought down the house.
[03:54:26.981 --> 03:54:30.021]  But anyway, Madeleine Albright, not all that bright.
[03:54:30.021 --> 03:54:32.141]  Bernie Sanders, just BS Bernie.
[03:54:32.141 --> 03:54:35.522]  He'll say what he needs to say to do what he wants to do to get elected.
[03:54:35.522 --> 03:54:43.783]  Anybody that would waste their life spending all this time running for campaign, to me, is out of their damn minds!
[03:54:43.783 --> 03:54:45.284]  They're crazy!
[03:54:45.284 --> 03:54:46.524]  They want power!
[03:54:46.524 --> 03:54:47.924]  They want to run!
[03:54:47.924 --> 03:54:49.604]  Eisenhower said it.
[03:54:49.604 --> 03:54:53.005]  Five-star general, Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces.
[03:54:55.097 --> 03:55:09.886]  Two-term president, who also warned us about the military-industrial complex robbing us of the genius of the scientists, sweat of the laborers, and the future of the children, which he was 100% right on, because the military-industrial complex has taken over.
[03:55:09.886 --> 03:55:22.714]  He has a quote, basically to the words, anyone running for office, anyone that seeks the office of presidency, is either an egomaniac or crazy.
[03:55:22.714 --> 03:55:23.334]  Yeah, you got it.
[03:55:25.267 --> 03:55:35.491]  I want to finish up in talking about what upset me very much last week, and that was President Trump's State of the Union Address.
[03:55:35.491 --> 03:55:47.175]  When he brought in that little boy, that deep state shill, Juan Guaido, into the House of Representatives, he should have never brought him in there.
[03:55:47.175 --> 03:55:54.478]  It was a disgrace to me as an American, and you know the motto of my magazine, the Trends Journal, think for yourself.
[03:55:56.212 --> 03:56:08.378]  To have this guy in there, this Guaido boy, the deep state guy that they want to put in there to overthrow the Maduro government.
[03:56:08.378 --> 03:56:15.662]  Here this evening is a very brave man who carries with him the hopes, dreams and aspirations of all Venezuelans.
[03:56:15.662 --> 03:56:21.805]  Joining us in this gallery is the true and legitimate president of Venezuela, Juan Guaido.
[03:56:23.203 --> 03:56:28.064]  Mr. President, please take this message back to your homeland.
[03:56:28.064 --> 03:56:36.786]  Please take this message back to America that all Americans are united with the Venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom.
[03:56:36.786 --> 03:56:41.408]  I am not behind Juan Guaido.
[03:56:41.408 --> 03:56:45.069]  I'm not behind Maduro.
[03:56:45.069 --> 03:56:46.589]  I am an American.
[03:56:47.814 --> 03:56:49.836]  No foreign entanglements.
[03:56:49.836 --> 03:57:01.209]  You'd think we'd care about Venezuela if their major export was broccoli and they weren't sitting on the world's largest oil reserves.
[03:57:01.209 --> 03:57:03.691]  Just like we're in the Middle East for that.
[03:57:03.691 --> 03:57:09.638]  So I totally, totally am opposed to this and all those dumbo craps
[03:57:10.714 --> 03:57:30.725]  And then we just heard from little Chuckie Schumer saying that Trump should be doing more to overthrow the government.
[03:57:30.725 --> 03:57:32.806]  So, thanks for tuning in.
[03:57:33.550 --> 03:57:35.292]  Remember, peace on Earth.
[03:57:35.292 --> 03:57:36.594]  That's all I want.
[03:57:36.594 --> 03:57:38.557]  Liberty, love, joy, and beauty.
[03:57:38.557 --> 03:57:41.541]  And do what you can to support InfoWars.
