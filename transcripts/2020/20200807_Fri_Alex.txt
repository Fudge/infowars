[00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.750]  So I have a lot of enemies out there.
[00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.890]  This may be the last time you'll see me for a while.
[00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:08.412]  A lot of very, very rich enemies, but they are not happy with what I'm doing.
[00:00:09.172 --> 00:00:13.234]  But I figure we have one chance to do it, and no other president's gonna do what I do.
[00:00:13.774 --> 00:00:21.897]  No other president would do a favored nations, a rebate, a buy from other nations at much less cost, nobody.
[00:00:22.917 --> 00:00:24.378]  And there are a lot of unhappy people
[00:00:26.074 --> 00:00:28.977]  And they're very rich people, and they're very unhappy.
[00:00:29.217 --> 00:00:31.940]  So he's telling you, we got one shot to save the country, they may kill me.
[00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:41.189]  Then I've got a stack of news here where they're saying we're gonna kill him, we're gonna remove him, we're gonna use the military on him, and if the cabinet doesn't go along with it, we're gonna put them in prison.
[00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.734]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:50.282 --> 00:01:03.230]  I have privately and publicly gotten messages to President Trump that he has to fire the bat signal and point out that they have been incrementally, at an ambient level, turning up the heat for civil war and martial law.
[00:01:03.851 --> 00:01:10.415]  And that in that atmosphere, the president will be cooed before the election because they know that there's about to be a Trump landslide.
[00:01:12.156 --> 00:01:17.880]  Well, President Trump and General Flynn both fired
[00:01:20.558 --> 00:01:28.304]  The headline on InfoWars.com for the live show feed today is Trump fires the bat signal
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.925]  Warns the American people that an active coup is taking place to remove him.
[00:01:59.426 --> 00:02:08.194]  And that's what all the preparations and all the race war and all the COVID-19 hoaxes about is putting you into that mental space.
[00:02:10.356 --> 00:02:11.237]  That mental space.
[00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:18.226]  Where you just accept that things aren't normal, so you will accept a president being removed while he's still in office.
[00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:25.070]  And that's publicly what the globalists of the Council on Foreign Relations and the Washington Post and CNN have been pushing.
[00:02:25.611 --> 00:02:34.276]  These are horrible people that have been caught not just spying on President Trump, but also spying on John Roberts and blackmailing him.
[00:02:36.177 --> 00:02:37.398]  It's been going on for a long time.
[00:02:38.424 --> 00:02:40.386]  And the chickens are coming home to roost, so they're desperate.
[00:02:40.406 --> 00:02:45.690]  Let's play that clip of Trump firing the bat signal.
[00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:49.533]  And you know, we put the image up at the end of the bat signal, and it's Trump.
[00:02:50.854 --> 00:02:53.396]  But we have to think of a symbol that Trump's firing up there.
[00:02:53.416 --> 00:03:01.963]  He's actually firing that symbol up there and asking for the American flag, which symbolizes the American people and our history and our future together.
[00:03:02.784 --> 00:03:04.245]  Trump's asking for our help.
[00:03:05.306 --> 00:03:07.248]  He's saying, this might be the last time you see me
[00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:10.009]  For a while.
[00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.711]  What does that mean?
[00:03:13.671 --> 00:03:14.792]  Guess we'll see him again in heaven?
[00:03:16.052 --> 00:03:17.633]  We'll see him again after they let him out of prison?
[00:03:20.354 --> 00:03:22.555]  We'll see on the other side of the veil after they put a bullet in his head?
[00:03:23.155 --> 00:03:24.536]  This is the real world.
[00:03:24.556 --> 00:03:28.218]  We're not in normal times, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:03:28.798 --> 00:03:36.622]  We're locked down under a giant hoax that the UN commands, and local grocery stores tell women, you wear your mask or get out, the UN says.
[00:03:38.695 --> 00:03:39.816]  They didn't send Blue Helmets.
[00:03:40.936 --> 00:03:45.218]  They sent Tony Fauci and Bill Gates.
[00:03:45.238 --> 00:03:47.960]  Here's what the President had to say one more time.
[00:03:51.107 --> 00:03:52.688]  So I have a lot of enemies out there.
[00:03:52.728 --> 00:03:54.789]  This may be the last time you'll see me for a while.
[00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:59.350]  A lot of very, very rich enemies, but they are not happy with what I'm doing.
[00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:04.172]  But I figure we have one chance to do it, and no other president's gonna do what I do.
[00:04:04.713 --> 00:04:12.836]  No other president would do a favored nations, a rebate, a buy from other nations at much less cost, nobody.
[00:04:13.856 --> 00:04:15.317]  And there are a lot of unhappy people
[00:04:17.013 --> 00:04:19.914]  And they're very rich people and they're very unhappy.
[00:04:20.094 --> 00:04:29.238]  So we're going to have more of this key speech and press conference he gave yesterday coming up on the other side.
[00:04:29.278 --> 00:04:39.642]  But I think you might want to raise the alarm like Paul Revere and take the live feed from InfoWars.com or BandOnVideo or NewsWars.com NewsWars.com forward slash show.
[00:04:41.101 --> 00:04:47.667]  And explain that there's an active coup against the president we elected because he's reversing the sellout of you and your family.
[00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:52.772]  Because if you like the lockdown we're under, understand it was always planned whether Trump got in or not.
[00:04:52.812 --> 00:04:57.417]  They intend to intensify it and CNN says it's never going to end.
[00:04:57.877 --> 00:05:04.464]  And they're going to shut down every mom-and-pop business and every farm in this country and send communists into your town to run your life.
[00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:10.291]  If you're receiving this transmission, my friends, you are the resistance.
[00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:23.157]  Thank you for joining us on this live August 7th, 2020 transmission with 87 days out from this election that the Democrats don't intend to have.
[00:05:23.857 --> 00:05:24.998]  Biden is a placeholder.
[00:05:25.058 --> 00:05:26.279]  They don't intend to have the debates.
[00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:31.121]  They don't intend to have any of it.
[00:05:31.181 --> 00:05:33.262]  They intend to remove Trump beforehand.
[00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:39.932]  Now they said they were going to not let the delegates see him on January 20th, 2017.
[00:05:41.452 --> 00:05:45.174]  And Nancy Pelosi's daughter was running an operation.
[00:05:46.314 --> 00:05:48.235]  And they were unable to get that done.
[00:05:49.055 --> 00:05:49.995]  So they may fail.
[00:05:50.035 --> 00:05:50.856]  They probably will fail.
[00:05:52.196 --> 00:05:56.938]  And of course they tried to take the delegates away from him when he was winning the Republican nomination months before that.
[00:05:59.099 --> 00:06:02.200]  And of course after that Obama came out and said he'll be gone in 90 days.
[00:06:04.414 --> 00:06:31.504]  That was to keep their stay-behind networks, their forces, embedded in government, competent and confident that they could stay in place, burrow in, leak false information, and remove the elected President of the United States and scuttle and steal the 2016 election.
[00:06:34.687 --> 00:06:38.010]  They wanted to abort it, even after it had happened.
[00:06:39.371 --> 00:06:47.079]  Even after it was out of its mother's womb, conceived with the minds of the American people, and executed on election day, 2016.
[00:06:49.701 --> 00:06:57.769]  And now we know they had multiple coup attempts, and now we know they canvassed the Pentagon for officers that would lead a coup of the President.
[00:06:58.928 --> 00:07:14.335]  And now we've had Atlantic Monthly, Foreign Affairs, Public Affairs, Financial Times of London, LA Times, New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, every single establishment publication talk about removing him via the 25th Amendment.
[00:07:15.455 --> 00:07:19.657]  Or CNN's had Clapper and Brennan on to talk about removing him outside of the 25th Amendment.
[00:07:21.158 --> 00:07:24.299]  And Blitzer says, what do you mean?
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.741]  Outside of impeachment?
[00:07:26.761 --> 00:07:27.461]  And they said, yeah.
[00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:30.090]  Just wait a few months.
[00:07:32.031 --> 00:07:40.093]  That was in late 2017, but they didn't have the guts to bite the bullet and do it.
[00:07:41.253 --> 00:07:48.556]  But now, they've got the COVID lockdown to put people into a state of otherworldliness.
[00:07:49.236 --> 00:07:53.997]  They've got the race riots funded by Soros and the Deep State and the Democrats and Obama and Hillary.
[00:07:54.517 --> 00:07:56.838]  And they've got Biden as a placeholder there.
[00:07:57.807 --> 00:08:01.690]  And they're openly talking about bringing Obama back as a VP for Hillary.
[00:08:02.771 --> 00:08:07.254]  You're going to see spectacular things in the next 87 days.
[00:08:07.314 --> 00:08:14.020]  But now, the president comes out in a speech yesterday and he says,
[00:08:17.825 --> 00:08:19.186]  I have powerful enemies.
[00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:21.568]  They're mad that I've not done one-sided trade deals.
[00:08:21.588 --> 00:08:28.494]  They're mad that I'm breaking up the system, the corrupt world government that was built off American ingenuity and money and power.
[00:08:30.535 --> 00:08:43.145]  In 1955, the United States had 57% of world wealth, the largest middle class in the world, and it was all sold off, not to empower the third world, but to totally take it over, at the same time making us weak.
[00:08:44.266 --> 00:08:46.088]  And so President Trump came out and said,
[00:08:48.939 --> 00:08:53.222]  That he needs us to understand that he's taking on powerful enemies.
[00:08:54.203 --> 00:08:56.204]  We've got this one shot to take America back.
[00:08:57.585 --> 00:08:59.766]  And that it's his job and his destiny to do it.
[00:09:00.447 --> 00:09:01.587]  And he's not backing down.
[00:09:02.468 --> 00:09:05.310]  But he's letting the world know I could be killed at any time.
[00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:08.332]  And I won't be seeing you for a while.
[00:09:08.352 --> 00:09:11.054]  I won't be seeing you until the other side in heaven.
[00:09:13.561 --> 00:09:16.505]  You see his wife out on TV saying, all things are possible through Christ.
[00:09:17.066 --> 00:09:18.327]  We must put our faith in Jesus.
[00:09:18.347 --> 00:09:22.713]  We're fighting not against flesh and blood, but against the powers of darkness.
[00:09:24.095 --> 00:09:28.120]  And General Flynn came out, I'm going to read this at the bottom of the hour, the articles on InfoWars.com.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.543]  I'm going to ask our great crew, Kit Daniels,
[00:09:31.909 --> 00:09:37.292]  To add a link to this article we posted last night to the live show feed so that people can go read it.
[00:09:37.412 --> 00:09:39.072]  General Flynn issues emergency warning.
[00:09:39.473 --> 00:09:43.935]  Communists are attempting to overthrow the United States under the command of Satan.
[00:09:45.796 --> 00:09:46.576]  And that's what it is.
[00:09:48.457 --> 00:09:59.162]  But you notice, Mariah Carey's sister and other siblings have come out and said we were part of satanic rituals.
[00:10:00.526 --> 00:10:02.647]  And now they're even taking the police to where it happened.
[00:10:03.427 --> 00:10:05.147]  And it's very, very credible.
[00:10:06.688 --> 00:10:21.013]  As I told you, ladies and gentlemen, when they tried to get me into the higher levels of Hollywood, they point blank told me, we do pledge ourselves to the devil.
[00:10:22.173 --> 00:10:27.975]  Mark Dice said it happened to him before he was going to be given a national reality TV show with
[00:10:28.908 --> 00:10:29.488]  I'll just say it.
[00:10:29.528 --> 00:10:37.652]  I'm a member of Motley Crue and he said, are you joking with the head of the company?
[00:10:37.692 --> 00:10:38.592]  He said, no, I'm not joking.
[00:10:39.453 --> 00:10:40.253]  You follow the devil.
[00:10:43.014 --> 00:10:44.435]  Now, do you want the million bucks?
[00:10:45.315 --> 00:10:46.336]  Tell me you love Lucifer.
[00:10:52.218 --> 00:10:53.239]  So here's the president.
[00:10:55.117 --> 00:11:00.598]  Yesterday in Ohio, talking about bringing back business to the United States at the Whirlpool factory.
[00:11:01.659 --> 00:11:02.899]  And he fires the bat signal.
[00:11:03.119 --> 00:11:05.160]  He's letting you know he's done everything he can.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:12.022]  He's done an incredible job because no one follows his orders basically under him, other than the military and the police to a certain extent.
[00:11:13.182 --> 00:11:13.982]  And they're under attack.
[00:11:15.423 --> 00:11:18.363]  And this country is in desperate, desperate, desperate straits, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:11:18.683 --> 00:11:20.204]  Pray for President Trump.
[00:11:21.504 --> 00:11:23.165]  And pray that our enemies be exposed.
[00:11:23.185 --> 00:11:24.085]  But the good news is,
[00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:27.412]  They're blackmailing their house of cards is coming down.
[00:11:28.013 --> 00:11:30.054]  Major Hollywood producers have gone public.
[00:11:30.475 --> 00:11:31.456]  We'll tell you about this coming up.
[00:11:31.876 --> 00:11:34.459]  Exposing the pedophile rings just yesterday.
[00:11:34.979 --> 00:11:36.981]  The producer of A Child's Voice has gone public.
[00:11:40.705 --> 00:11:43.587]  After Amazon censored their already best-selling film.
[00:11:44.308 --> 00:11:44.929]  It's all coming up.
[00:11:44.949 --> 00:11:47.211]  But here's the president yesterday in context.
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.441]  Talking about how he's taken on the most rich and powerful people in the world.
[00:11:52.841 --> 00:11:55.242]  America has one chance to get back control of its destiny.
[00:11:55.262 --> 00:11:56.863]  Here it is.
[00:11:56.963 --> 00:11:58.183]  I don't know who the middlemen are.
[00:11:59.144 --> 00:11:59.564]  I don't know.
[00:11:59.644 --> 00:12:02.965]  They never say middlewomen, so they're politically not correct.
[00:12:03.985 --> 00:12:06.166]  But I've heard the term middlemen for a long time.
[00:12:06.206 --> 00:12:07.286]  They are so wealthy.
[00:12:08.027 --> 00:12:08.947]  They are so wealthy.
[00:12:09.007 --> 00:12:11.128]  Nobody has any idea who the hell they are, what they do.
[00:12:12.088 --> 00:12:13.909]  They make more money than the drug companies.
[00:12:13.929 --> 00:12:17.170]  You know, in all fairness, at least the drug companies have to produce a product.
[00:12:17.895 --> 00:12:19.124]  It has to be a good product.
[00:12:19.668 --> 00:12:20.353]  But the middlemen...
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:28.304]  Well, the rebate that I'm doing cuts out the middlemen and it reduces costs and the money goes back to the people purchasing the drugs.
[00:12:29.044 --> 00:12:30.625]  So I have a lot of enemies out there.
[00:12:30.665 --> 00:12:32.746]  This may be the last time you'll see me for a while.
[00:12:32.766 --> 00:12:37.288]  A lot of very, very rich enemies, but they are not happy with what I'm doing.
[00:12:38.048 --> 00:12:42.110]  But I figure we have one chance to do it and no other president is going to do what I do.
[00:12:42.651 --> 00:12:50.175]  No other president would do a favored nations, a rebate, a buy from other nations at much less cost.
[00:12:50.295 --> 00:12:50.735]  Nobody.
[00:12:51.798 --> 00:12:53.299]  And there are a lot of unhappy people.
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.842]  And they're very rich people, and they're very unhappy.
[00:12:57.882 --> 00:13:00.604]  Here's my fourth promise to American workers.
[00:13:01.224 --> 00:13:13.993]  Beyond our medical supply chains over the next four years, we will launch our millions of new manufacturing jobs across many other critical sectors that are vital to our national security and prosperity.
[00:13:14.733 --> 00:13:18.436]  From electronics to machine tools to shipping aerospace autos,
[00:13:19.249 --> 00:13:21.310]  And of course, to iron and to steel.
[00:13:22.410 --> 00:13:25.791]  And we'll never forget your washers and your dryers, okay?
[00:13:26.511 --> 00:13:28.792]  During eight years of the last administration.
[00:13:32.253 --> 00:13:34.313]  And by the way, I have to just tell you this little story.
[00:13:34.333 --> 00:13:36.154]  A couple of little stories, if you don't mind.
[00:13:36.194 --> 00:13:36.654]  Do you mind?
[00:13:36.674 --> 00:13:39.615]  Okay, because that's better than the other stuff, right?
[00:13:41.107 --> 00:13:45.734]  No, I was with somebody and they said, you know, for a dishwasher, we don't have enough water, sir.
[00:13:46.175 --> 00:13:49.640]  I think a lot of the people in the audience would understand what I'm saying.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.846]  They don't have enough water because they put restrictors on, so you don't have any water.
[00:13:55.836 --> 00:13:56.716]  I said, what is that?
[00:13:56.917 --> 00:13:57.297]  What is that?
[00:13:57.357 --> 00:14:01.499]  In most states, I mean, outside of desert areas, we have so much water, we don't know what to do with it, right?
[00:14:01.519 --> 00:14:02.199]  A lot of states.
[00:14:02.259 --> 00:14:03.940]  Your state does pretty well with water, right?
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:05.741]  So they have plenty of water.
[00:14:06.521 --> 00:14:21.588]  So there's the president in context explaining how we're being enslaved, we're being told to go without, while these globalists transfer all the wealth to themselves and say, oh, COVID's to help the poor person, when it's hurt the poor people and made more of the billionaires than it's ever done before.
[00:14:21.968 --> 00:14:24.590]  The president has fired the bat signal.
[00:14:25.424 --> 00:14:29.527]  He's telling you that there's an active coup against him, and he knows they're preparing to kill him.
[00:14:30.268 --> 00:14:31.969]  What are we going to do to stand up against that?
[00:14:31.989 --> 00:14:39.294]  87 days until the election the deep state doesn't want to have.
[00:14:39.895 --> 00:14:41.576]  They've got their fake mail-in ballots.
[00:14:42.617 --> 00:14:43.738]  They've got the illegals voting.
[00:14:43.758 --> 00:14:46.880]  They've got millions voting the names of dead people off the voter rolls.
[00:14:48.761 --> 00:14:51.984]  But is that enough of their electronic voting machines with the landslide?
[00:14:53.305 --> 00:14:57.787]  That many inside experts, I also believe, is really going to happen.
[00:14:57.827 --> 00:15:00.489]  The American people are rejecting the New World Order.
[00:15:00.529 --> 00:15:01.389]  So what are they planning?
[00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:04.751]  If you just joined us, President Trump came out.
[00:15:05.552 --> 00:15:07.233]  Let's play the short 30-second version.
[00:15:07.353 --> 00:15:09.354]  I just played it in context, a two-minute clip.
[00:15:10.194 --> 00:15:17.738]  And said, there are a lot of powerful people, because I'm moving pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the U.S.
[00:15:18.399 --> 00:15:21.981]  Over 90% of our manufacturing is done overseas, most of it in China.
[00:15:23.117 --> 00:15:24.537]  He said, I'm bringing it back.
[00:15:27.338 --> 00:15:30.819]  And he said, a lot of people are powerful and they want to get rid of me, so.
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.580]  May not see me for a while.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.321]  A lot of powerful people are angry.
[00:15:37.901 --> 00:15:39.542]  That means, see me in heaven.
[00:15:39.562 --> 00:15:43.903]  It's a very obvious statement.
[00:15:43.923 --> 00:15:45.164]  He didn't mean he's going to go to prison.
[00:15:45.184 --> 00:15:47.244]  He means, we'll be seeing you for a while.
[00:15:47.264 --> 00:15:49.685]  It's like grandpa says when he's dying, I'll see you.
[00:15:50.811 --> 00:15:51.471]  Just be a good man.
[00:15:51.832 --> 00:15:52.452]  I'll see you in heaven.
[00:15:52.592 --> 00:15:52.853]  Love you.
[00:15:52.873 --> 00:15:58.297]  If you're ever out in the woods, hunting or whatever, and you hear something rustling around the bushes, that's my spirit.
[00:15:58.637 --> 00:15:59.918]  I'm there looking over you.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:08.684]  It's like when Trump came out and said, I wish Ghislaine Maxwell well, I said, he means he didn't want her to die in prison.
[00:16:08.704 --> 00:16:12.107]  He wants her to turn against the insiders and expose them.
[00:16:12.127 --> 00:16:14.428]  And people said, oh no, he's signaling he likes her.
[00:16:14.488 --> 00:16:15.589]  No, no.
[00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:18.792]  And then Trump came out and said, no, I don't want her to die in prison.
[00:16:19.775 --> 00:16:21.538]  I want her to expose who she was involved with.
[00:16:21.558 --> 00:16:23.801]  It's a very obvious statement.
[00:16:24.762 --> 00:16:25.724]  He's fired the bat signal.
[00:16:25.764 --> 00:16:27.226]  He says, powerful people are coming after me.
[00:16:28.407 --> 00:16:30.791]  He says, we got one shot to do this.
[00:16:31.732 --> 00:16:32.934]  Here's what he said again if you just joined us.
[00:16:40.768 --> 00:16:42.349]  So I have a lot of enemies out there.
[00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:44.451]  This may be the last time you'll see me for a while.
[00:16:44.471 --> 00:16:49.015]  A lot of very, very rich enemies, but they are not happy with what I'm doing.
[00:16:49.776 --> 00:16:53.840]  But I figure we have one chance to do it, and no other president's gonna do what I do.
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:17:02.507]  No other president would do a favored nations, a rebate, a buy from other nations at much less cost, nobody.
[00:17:03.528 --> 00:17:04.990]  And there are a lot of unhappy people.
[00:17:06.674 --> 00:17:09.637]  And they're very rich people, and they're very unhappy.
[00:17:10.418 --> 00:17:13.140]  So he's telling you, we got one shot to save the country, they may kill me.
[00:17:14.121 --> 00:17:22.388]  Then I've got a stack of news here where they're saying, we're gonna kill him, we're gonna remove him, we're gonna use the military on him, and if the cabinet doesn't go along with it, we're gonna put them in prison.
[00:17:23.269 --> 00:17:28.514]  Here's the Washington Post, Trump could lose and not leave, but cabinet members who try to help could face prison.
[00:17:30.097 --> 00:17:44.021]  So they're saying he's illegitimate, just like they said, and if he fights the election, if he says we tried to steal it, or if there's a challenged election, which all the experts are saying is going to happen again, if he challenges, the Democrats challenging, he'll be removed by the military.
[00:17:44.061 --> 00:17:44.881]  What did Biden say?
[00:17:44.901 --> 00:17:47.002]  He said the same thing.
[00:17:47.322 --> 00:17:50.983]  Biden absolutely convinced the military would escort Trump from the White House.
[00:17:51.663 --> 00:17:56.904]  Here's Pelosi, says Trump will be fumigated out if he refuses to leave after White House loss.
[00:17:57.144 --> 00:17:59.205]  One way or another, he's gone.
[00:18:01.032 --> 00:18:02.213]  Then you've got Right Wing Watch.
[00:18:02.333 --> 00:18:04.354]  You notice, it doesn't ever show a video of me.
[00:18:04.714 --> 00:18:09.956]  Because they took a long talk and edited the words together like the refrigerator magnet game.
[00:18:11.797 --> 00:18:16.239]  I could take the Bible and trim up the New Testament and have the words saying, Jesus loves Satan.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.740]  Jesus loves Moloch.
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:19.681]  It's not true.
[00:18:20.661 --> 00:18:21.461]  But that's what they said.
[00:18:21.922 --> 00:18:25.223]  Alex Jones tells listeners to get ready to die to fight the New World Order.
[00:18:25.243 --> 00:18:29.125]  They have another headline saying, I say go out and quote, kill a lot of people.
[00:18:30.302 --> 00:18:48.738]  No, what I said was, is that the Weathermen, whose system is running anti-fund Black Lives Matter, the founders of Black Lives Matter say it, funded by Soros, say they want to collapse civilization and then bring in China and Cuba and others to put 50 million people in re-education camps and then kill 25 million.
[00:18:49.059 --> 00:18:49.579]  That's when the U.S.
[00:18:49.599 --> 00:18:51.160]  population was 190 million.
[00:18:52.602 --> 00:18:55.084]  So I guess by those new numbers, they'd want to put 90 million in and kill 40 million.
[00:18:57.759 --> 00:18:58.739]  Or something around those numbers.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:00.280]  This is their idea!
[00:19:01.821 --> 00:19:04.942]  And look how close they are to doing it, because we stand down, we roll over.
[00:19:05.423 --> 00:19:08.024]  We reject the President openly trying to save the Republic.
[00:19:08.684 --> 00:19:14.107]  We reject the President openly trying to say, we've got one-sided trade deals, we've got open borders.
[00:19:15.367 --> 00:19:17.569]  We've got China stealing our intellectual property.
[00:19:18.009 --> 00:19:23.731]  And then, the media, the Washington Post says, Xi Jinping must destroy Trump to save America.
[00:19:23.751 --> 00:19:24.612]  Remember that headline?
[00:19:26.291 --> 00:19:27.271]  Destroy Trump.
[00:19:27.912 --> 00:19:29.412]  And the left cheers China.
[00:19:30.313 --> 00:19:31.673]  They're against their own country.
[00:19:31.713 --> 00:19:32.354]  They're idiots.
[00:19:33.094 --> 00:19:35.715]  And that's what's de-industrialized them and enslaved them.
[00:19:36.015 --> 00:19:37.896]  And they're told that they're a service economy now.
[00:19:39.037 --> 00:19:46.020]  And then COVID-19 shuts down the small-time service economy, hurts the left the worst, and they go, we want total martial law.
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.221]  That'll fix it and they'll get even worse.
[00:19:48.281 --> 00:19:50.402]  But they don't care because they're schmucks.
[00:19:52.002 --> 00:19:55.644]  Xi's choice, destroy Trump or save him and weaken America.
[00:19:57.105 --> 00:20:00.526]  Oh yeah, because selling us out to China really strengthens the country.
[00:20:00.546 --> 00:20:05.167]  It's like the Federal Reserve head goes, we need to keep the lockdowns going to save the economy.
[00:20:07.188 --> 00:20:08.548]  Meanwhile, the national numbers are out.
[00:20:09.549 --> 00:20:14.110]  It's 0.037 death rate for COVID infections.
[00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:14.110]  0.037.
[00:20:14.150 --> 00:20:15.050]  37% of one point.
[00:20:15.491 --> 00:20:15.591]  No.
[00:20:29.384 --> 00:20:31.986]  It's not even that.
[00:20:32.227 --> 00:20:34.429]  The flu's ten times more deadly, they're saying now.
[00:20:34.509 --> 00:20:35.169]  Not three times.
[00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:36.611]  Total hoax!
[00:20:37.251 --> 00:20:41.895]  But they can focus on every person that dies of some pneumonia or flu.
[00:20:42.135 --> 00:20:42.796]  You always read letters.
[00:20:42.816 --> 00:20:43.657]  They had cancer.
[00:20:44.217 --> 00:20:45.438]  Herman Cain was really healthy.
[00:20:45.458 --> 00:20:48.021]  He had three pounds of cancer and couldn't barely walk.
[00:20:49.222 --> 00:20:50.263]  These people are really healthy.
[00:20:50.283 --> 00:20:51.564]  They had diabetes and cancer.
[00:20:52.445 --> 00:20:55.848]  This kid was born with holes in their heart and was in surgery and died, but we're saying COVID.
[00:20:56.570 --> 00:21:01.655]  Here's Larry Grathwald, the Green Beret that infiltrated the Weathermen, when they're sitting around talking about what they're going to do to us and our families.
[00:21:01.835 --> 00:21:02.275]  Here it is.
[00:21:05.798 --> 00:21:09.341]  I brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government.
[00:21:10.622 --> 00:21:17.108]  You know, we become responsible then for administrating, you know, 250 million people.
[00:21:19.210 --> 00:21:20.211]  And there was no answers.
[00:21:21.492 --> 00:21:23.534]  No one had given any thought to economics.
[00:21:24.736 --> 00:21:26.657]  How are you going to clothe and feed these people?
[00:21:27.817 --> 00:21:38.220]  The only thing that I could get was that they expected that the Cubans and the North Vietnamese and the Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions of the United States.
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:44.862]  They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the counter-revolution.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:56.426]  And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[00:21:58.888 --> 00:22:05.172]  Where we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them.
[00:22:06.678 --> 00:22:07.999]  How things were going to be.
[00:22:08.899 --> 00:22:12.501]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate?
[00:22:13.222 --> 00:22:15.263]  That are die-hard capitalists?
[00:22:16.363 --> 00:22:19.005]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[00:22:20.405 --> 00:22:28.210]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[00:22:28.850 --> 00:22:30.551]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[00:22:32.159 --> 00:22:32.799]  25 million people.
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:49.054]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational centers, and hear them
[00:22:50.484 --> 00:22:57.108]  Figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people and they were dead serious.
[00:22:57.848 --> 00:23:09.195]  So I laid that out on my right-wing watch rant and I said that if they take over and try this we're going to really fight them and by the way on all the Bernie tapes they said they want to kill us and our families.
[00:23:10.195 --> 00:23:15.758]  The Soros financed monster Letitia James that sent close to 10,000
[00:23:17.463 --> 00:23:23.845]  Old people in nursing homes to their deaths by sending infected COVID patients to them, right at half the deaths in New York.
[00:23:24.545 --> 00:23:41.289]  The monster, the serial killer, has pledged to destroy America's oldest civil rights organization established after the Civil War to train blacks how to learn how to use guns in the South and to train Northerners how to shoot because the South had whooped their ass because Northerners were living in cities.
[00:23:42.352 --> 00:23:43.873]  Talk about an American institution.
[00:23:43.913 --> 00:23:45.094]  She pledges we'll help.
[00:23:45.174 --> 00:23:45.795]  Hear it from her.
[00:23:45.995 --> 00:23:46.615]  To destroy it.
[00:23:46.656 --> 00:23:47.256]  Here she is.
[00:23:48.717 --> 00:23:52.280]  And the co-chief of the enforcement section, Emily Stern.
[00:23:55.443 --> 00:24:09.114]  Just a few minutes ago, my office filed a lawsuit against the National Rifle Association to dissolve the organization in its entirety for years of self-dealing and illegal conduct.
[00:24:10.598 --> 00:24:12.381]  So she's gonna abolish it.
[00:24:12.421 --> 00:24:12.702]  Wow.
[00:24:13.603 --> 00:24:19.853]  I mean, even if the NRA did something wrong, which there's no evidence they did.
[00:24:23.783 --> 00:24:24.963]  This is purely political.
[00:24:24.983 --> 00:24:27.724]  You would just have Wayne LaPierre step down or whoever did something wrong.
[00:24:28.025 --> 00:24:33.227]  You don't get rid of one of the oldest institutions in America that represents tens of millions of Americans.
[00:24:33.307 --> 00:24:34.507]  I know Ted Nugent's a board member.
[00:24:34.527 --> 00:24:36.268]  I don't know how much he can say about this.
[00:24:36.288 --> 00:24:38.268]  We can talk about the state of the Second Amendment, the state of the country in general.
[00:24:38.769 --> 00:24:43.811]  I begged Trump to fire the bat signal and point out they're trying a new coup with election fraud in the Washington Post.
[00:24:43.831 --> 00:24:45.831]  Talking about the military removing him.
[00:24:46.211 --> 00:24:48.292]  Trump came out and said, I may not be here much longer.
[00:24:48.332 --> 00:24:49.713]  They may take me out yesterday.
[00:24:50.613 --> 00:24:52.874]  General Flimp had a letter saying it's good versus evil.
[00:24:52.894 --> 00:24:54.995]  We're in the middle of an attempted communist overthrow.
[00:24:55.476 --> 00:24:56.616]  That's really happening.
[00:24:56.936 --> 00:25:04.500]  Ted Nugent, as you said last time you came on, you didn't say it on air, you said to me privately, you said, Alex, they've been working towards this for 50 plus years.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.461]  Our whole lives are coming down to what's happening right now.
[00:25:07.822 --> 00:25:08.942]  You've got the floor, my friend.
[00:25:09.362 --> 00:25:14.105]  What can you say to us about the nightmare scenario we're seeing unfold and what should we all do right now?
[00:25:14.145 --> 00:25:18.867]  Because I mean, I'm a peaceful guy and I'm not a general that's going to lead any charges here.
[00:25:19.868 --> 00:25:27.978]  Well, I can go back quite a ways with everything you say and present, Alex.
[00:25:28.018 --> 00:25:35.727]  So let me just start by saying we the people give you a huge, loud and proud ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto, ditto.
[00:25:36.047 --> 00:25:37.169]  I want to say, first of all,
[00:25:38.182 --> 00:25:48.146]  It's a pain in the ass and a crying shame, really, that we have to fight this culture war at these toxic levels, these demonic, treasonous levels.
[00:25:48.206 --> 00:25:57.930]  But if the line were drawn in the sand any more obvious, we'd be falling off the click of Venezuela by now.
[00:25:57.990 --> 00:26:06.413]  So let me just repeat the obvious, and that is that God gave me the instinct and the mindset and the spirit
[00:26:07.071 --> 00:26:08.352]  For self-preservation.
[00:26:08.452 --> 00:26:18.257]  Our founding fathers knew that the kings and the tyrants and the punk-ass dictators didn't allow citizens to have these rights to exercise our pure instincts from God.
[00:26:18.297 --> 00:26:20.478]  So we wrote it down in the Constitution.
[00:26:20.558 --> 00:26:23.760]  And we fought a war and we set up the most successful country in history.
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:24.320]  Damn right.
[00:26:24.601 --> 00:26:24.821]  Sorry.
[00:26:24.841 --> 00:26:30.664]  Yeah, where there's this little thing called freedom where we the people get to determine our life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.
[00:26:31.218 --> 00:26:41.487]  We can go ahead and examine and scrutinize the cockroaches that your brilliant spotlight exposes every day, but I've got a pretty good cockroach spotlight myself.
[00:26:41.527 --> 00:26:48.113]  I've been exercising, increasing the lumens for about 50 some years now, and it's never been more
[00:26:48.678 --> 00:26:56.322]  Offensive and heartbreaking that the left is so obvious in their, you're damn right we're going to take your guns!
[00:26:56.462 --> 00:26:59.444]  You're, yeah, the AR-15s, we're coming to get them!
[00:26:59.544 --> 00:27:07.609]  I mean, they used to hide that thinking people were so stupid that they actually wanted common sense gun safety reform.
[00:27:07.649 --> 00:27:08.169]  Yeah, right.
[00:27:08.389 --> 00:27:12.371]  And I play accordion in the Zydeco band with Galen Jenner.
[00:27:12.611 --> 00:27:15.013]  My point is, is that if we the people
[00:27:15.573 --> 00:27:19.696]  We can't just identify the toxic beast at the door.
[00:27:20.196 --> 00:27:25.860]  We've got to tell our elected employees that we see the toxic beast at the door.
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:28.841]  Get rid of the toxic beast!
[00:27:29.222 --> 00:27:38.007]  I have a son who has a wonderful restaurant that's been shut down by the Communist Chinese virus Democrats in the state of New York.
[00:27:38.147 --> 00:27:43.290]  I was denied entry into that state recently to say thank you to the law enforcement heroes.
[00:27:45.302 --> 00:27:47.724]  This is Nazi Germany.
[00:27:48.265 --> 00:27:57.555]  And I know they haven't kicked down everybody's door yet, but they're kicking down doors, they're taking weapons, they're taking away freedom.
[00:27:57.595 --> 00:28:02.861]  So all I can say, Alex, is what I've repeated ad nauseam, ad infinitum.
[00:28:03.459 --> 00:28:11.808]  If we the people who don't see these demonic behaviors and treasonous behaviors by the left and every Democrat I can imagine.
[00:28:12.068 --> 00:28:13.950]  I mean, they're all in the same gang.
[00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:19.516]  You can't wear a sheet on your head and claim you don't support the KKK.
[00:28:19.816 --> 00:28:22.439]  If you're at the burning cross and you're part of that team,
[00:28:22.979 --> 00:28:24.380]  That's what you represent.
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:30.442]  And the Democrats represent, you don't need to read this, you need to sign it to find out what's in it.
[00:28:30.682 --> 00:28:37.464]  And then Pelosi commits a felony on live television as she destroys our State of the Union.
[00:28:37.524 --> 00:28:46.868]  I could go on and on with the Hillary Clinton and the Barack Obama and the Eric Holder who gave guns to Mexican gangs to kill Brian Terry and how they told the U.S.
[00:28:46.908 --> 00:28:47.948]  Marine Corps, don't
[00:28:48.408 --> 00:28:51.030]  Save the Americans and Benghazi.
[00:28:51.390 --> 00:28:57.915]  And brain-dead traitors like Juan Williams still claims that Benghazi didn't happen.
[00:28:58.355 --> 00:29:00.977]  I could go on with thousands of examples.
[00:29:00.997 --> 00:29:02.298]  Or Antifa doesn't exist.
[00:29:02.438 --> 00:29:03.699]  Nadler, let me throw this at you.
[00:29:04.807 --> 00:29:09.751]  They're now coming trying to block you playing around the country or anybody else's patriot.
[00:29:10.072 --> 00:29:11.833]  They're barring people coming into New York.
[00:29:12.234 --> 00:29:13.915]  They're killing old people in the nursing homes.
[00:29:13.995 --> 00:29:16.237]  And now they're censoring the president's tweets.
[00:29:16.337 --> 00:29:18.760]  And now he's saying, I'm taking them on.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.861]  I'm bringing the jobs back.
[00:29:19.921 --> 00:29:21.062]  I'm bringing big pharma back.
[00:29:21.342 --> 00:29:22.663]  They're going to try to take me out.
[00:29:22.983 --> 00:29:24.305]  I may not see you for a while.
[00:29:24.585 --> 00:29:28.949]  Is that not President Trump firing the bat signal telling us that, hey, this is serious?
[00:29:30.017 --> 00:29:33.019]  Well, and again, Alex Jones has been shining the bat signal.
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.381]  I've been shining the bat signal.
[00:29:34.401 --> 00:29:35.942]  That's why we're considered extremists.
[00:29:35.982 --> 00:29:51.034]  And there are so many people, including family members and friends and co-workers, listening to us right now, that when we repeat what sounds unbelievable, Alex Jones says that Cuomo sent in COVID-positive people and killed 6,000 elderly.
[00:29:52.782 --> 00:29:54.884]  That's exactly what he did!
[00:29:55.244 --> 00:29:58.908]  So again, Cuomo's not the worst violator.
[00:29:59.308 --> 00:30:08.376]  It's people who know what he did and don't fix their friends and their families and their co-workers and go, it's not a wild conspiracy.
[00:30:08.857 --> 00:30:11.499]  We have the dead bodies to prove it.
[00:30:11.779 --> 00:30:16.564]  And again, Alex, I gotta tell you, liberalism is a spiritual curse.
[00:30:17.244 --> 00:30:19.066]  Tyranny is slavery.
[00:30:19.594 --> 00:30:33.167]  Democrats are tyrants, and if we the people who believe in truth, logic, common sense, life, liberty, pursuit of happiness, and God-given individual rights guaranteed by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, if we don't raise hell!
[00:30:33.942 --> 00:30:43.029]  With everybody in our lives to vote God, family, country against tyrants, against Second Amendment destroyers, Joe Biden and his entire gang.
[00:30:43.329 --> 00:30:46.291]  If we don't do that, we deserve what we get.
[00:30:46.711 --> 00:30:47.012]  I agree.
[00:30:47.032 --> 00:30:48.553]  We've got to get out of our comfort zones.
[00:30:48.573 --> 00:30:50.074]  We've got to go knock on neighbors' doors.
[00:30:50.094 --> 00:30:52.015]  We've got to call people randomly out of the phone.
[00:30:52.035 --> 00:30:59.661]  But we've got to all send people audio clips, videos, text messages with this interview, with your articles from TedNugent.com.
[00:31:00.001 --> 00:31:02.303]  If everybody just reaches 10, 20 people a day,
[00:31:02.743 --> 00:31:24.128]  And raises the alarm as modern Paul Revere's, the globalists can't get away with this, but I know you're on the NRA board, I know you can't specifically get into the attacks that are going on, but to have this Soros-appointed person trying to lie about the NRA and saying she's gonna shut it down, that tells us we're two minutes to midnight and imagine if Trump loses what they're gonna do.
[00:31:25.011 --> 00:31:26.291]  Well, and let me clarify.
[00:31:26.411 --> 00:31:34.693]  As a standing member of the National Rifle Association Board of Directors, I've received some of the highest votes in the history of this great civil rights organization.
[00:31:34.713 --> 00:31:40.754]  And I thank everybody from the bottom of my greasy, all-American, barbecue heart, rock and roll soul.
[00:31:42.335 --> 00:31:45.275]  The reason I get the votes is not because I'm a paper pusher.
[00:31:45.655 --> 00:31:50.076]  It's not because I study, you know, accounting and I study their agenda.
[00:31:50.296 --> 00:31:53.377]  What I represent is that the First Amendment
[00:31:53.897 --> 00:31:59.340]  Is good in all 50 states without government-issued paperwork.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.641]  Let me repeat that, Alex.
[00:32:01.741 --> 00:32:08.345]  I have a First Amendment in all 50 states without paperwork.
[00:32:09.305 --> 00:32:14.568]  That's the same right I want and I demand for the Second Amendment.
[00:32:14.728 --> 00:32:16.569]  And people go, well, the bad guys can get guns.
[00:32:16.809 --> 00:32:20.271]  Then keep the damn bad guys in a cage.
[00:32:20.571 --> 00:32:22.492]  We have engineered
[00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:24.042]  Recidivism.
[00:32:24.222 --> 00:32:25.425]  Alex, write that down.
[00:32:25.565 --> 00:32:26.628]  Everybody write it down.
[00:32:31.380 --> 00:32:32.681]  Ted, stay there, we've got to go to break.
[00:32:33.061 --> 00:32:34.142]  We've got one more segment with you.
[00:32:34.162 --> 00:32:35.464]  We'll come back and talk about that.
[00:32:35.704 --> 00:32:40.128]  And now the Democrats say we're going to release all the criminals, but if you don't wear a mask, we're going to put you in jail.
[00:32:40.308 --> 00:32:43.210]  But we want to abolish the police, but the police need to come take your guns.
[00:32:43.671 --> 00:32:51.097]  All right, we've got ten and a half minutes left with the Motor City Madman, Ted Nugent, who's in the great city of Texas right now, but about to head back up to Michigan in a few days.
[00:32:51.557 --> 00:32:54.300]  He'll be joining us again, obviously, during the next 87 days.
[00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:57.563]  This do-or-die time for the Republic, when the real forces of evil
[00:32:58.103 --> 00:32:59.044]  I'm not lying folks, that's true.
[00:32:59.064 --> 00:33:00.584]  Look it up, it's in the mainstream news.
[00:33:01.065 --> 00:33:04.967]  They are saying abolish the nuclear family, take all the guns, that China's our friend, that America's bad.
[00:33:04.987 --> 00:33:06.348]  Ted Nugent, you were getting into recidivism.
[00:33:21.776 --> 00:33:41.550]  And how they're releasing the rapists and murderers, but saying people that don't wear masks are going to go to jail, and saying abolish the police, but you also can't have a gun, and in places like Minnesota and Minneapolis, as you know, the police chief came out this week and said, we cannot protect you, but you're not allowed to protect yourself.
[00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:43.291]  Do what the criminals say.
[00:33:43.651 --> 00:33:45.012]  Give them everything you've got.
[00:33:45.152 --> 00:33:46.273]  Follow their directions.
[00:33:46.573 --> 00:33:48.234]  I mean, this is mass Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:33:48.274 --> 00:33:48.995]  Can you speak to that?
[00:33:49.793 --> 00:33:51.094]  Well, I pay attention.
[00:33:51.134 --> 00:34:05.568]  I actually believe that guitar players qualify as we the people, so I make sure that I do my duties as a husband and a father and a grandfather and a bandmate and a citizen and a neighbor and a hard-working American in the asset column producing instead of taking.
[00:34:05.928 --> 00:34:07.650]  So that's why I'm considered a radical.
[00:34:07.670 --> 00:34:10.613]  But all the things you're mentioning are just so glaring.
[00:34:10.673 --> 00:34:11.514]  It's amazing.
[00:34:13.416 --> 00:34:16.601]  I mean, literally, the Democrats are on the side of Antifa.
[00:34:16.641 --> 00:34:17.302]  They're terrorists.
[00:34:17.322 --> 00:34:18.844]  They're on the side of terrorists.
[00:34:19.104 --> 00:34:22.729]  They're on the side of Black Lives Matter, which has nothing to do with black lives.
[00:34:22.769 --> 00:34:26.114]  It has everything to do with the intentional destruction
[00:34:26.678 --> 00:34:37.301]  Of every quality of life procedure in the history of the United States of America that gives more freedom than any society in the history of mankind, and they side with MS-13.
[00:34:37.561 --> 00:34:41.642]  Let's make sure that everybody knows that Ted Nugent doesn't even have to be a radical.
[00:34:41.762 --> 00:34:54.505]  Alex Jones doesn't have to be an extremist to merely show the footage of Nancy Pelosi trying to find redeemable qualities for the MS-13 gangbangers whose battle cry is,
[00:34:56.821 --> 00:35:01.364]  I don't have to guess what that means.
[00:35:01.864 --> 00:35:08.989]  The Democrats are on the side of the devils that are killing, raping, and torching America.
[00:35:09.609 --> 00:35:10.470]  It's Alex!
[00:35:11.167 --> 00:35:12.788]  What planet have we landed on?
[00:35:12.808 --> 00:35:13.809]  But you're right.
[00:35:14.449 --> 00:35:19.213]  As these so-called judges, how they qualify as a judge is beyond me.
[00:35:19.613 --> 00:35:24.296]  Or these parole boards, or these state prosecutors, or these state attorney generals.
[00:35:24.676 --> 00:35:33.042]  They continue to let rapists, and murderers, and stabbers, and assaulters, and burglars, and carjackers, and child molesters.
[00:35:33.342 --> 00:35:34.743]  They keep letting them out.
[00:35:34.964 --> 00:35:36.705]  This is not a Ted Nugent hunch.
[00:35:37.265 --> 00:36:00.247]  It's articulated and outlined in the FBI Uniform Crime Report that years ago, even before the Chinese virus and years before the Democrats became members of terrorist organizations, you know, the ones that believe in genital mutilation, we have members of Congress and the Senate that side with that voodoo, that side with the voodoo of
[00:36:00.817 --> 00:36:04.499]  Genital mutilation and throwing gays off of roofs.
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:05.560]  This isn't it!
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.922]  I don't have to search for such atrocities.
[00:36:09.342 --> 00:36:10.403]  They're on record.
[00:36:10.643 --> 00:36:14.926]  But yes, we are living in engineered recidivism.
[00:36:15.366 --> 00:36:19.489]  The so-called court system of our country guarantees
[00:36:20.009 --> 00:36:27.398]  That you and I will pass by convicted murderers and rapists and child molesters and sex traffickers.
[00:36:27.738 --> 00:36:39.573]  They keep letting them out and then they make it more difficult if not downright eliminate the capability of a free American to purchase a gun or ammunition.
[00:36:40.013 --> 00:36:42.394]  And here's the fascinating part.
[00:36:42.754 --> 00:36:52.279]  When people hear you and I talk like this, luckily we have a selective audience that already has the soulfulness to examine conditions in America.
[00:36:52.319 --> 00:36:53.659]  So they know we're speaking the truth.
[00:36:53.699 --> 00:36:58.742]  The evidence is inescapable, unless you've got your ears, eyes, and heart plugged up.
[00:36:59.342 --> 00:37:05.485]  But the evidence for engineered recidivism is inescapable, and once again,
[00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:21.284]  If we the people don't raise hell with our senators, our congressmen, our mayor, our governor, our attorney generals, then why are you letting out violent criminals while arresting people going to church?
[00:37:23.704 --> 00:37:39.197]  Alex, in Michigan you could not, by law, buy seed for a garden, go in your boat, but you could buy dope and whiskey and buy lottery tickets, and you can riot, but you can't go to church.
[00:37:39.798 --> 00:37:40.519]  It's incredible.
[00:37:40.539 --> 00:37:45.303]  It's right out of the old Soviet Union or Communist China, and they admit that the model is Communist China.
[00:37:45.323 --> 00:37:47.225]  Let me raise this point.
[00:37:48.257 --> 00:37:58.546]  People need to know that if they don't get extremely politically active, extremely politically aggressive, that the communists and the globalists believe this is their move to overthrow America, they're really trying it right now.
[00:37:58.566 --> 00:38:06.333]  I have videos in England where journalists show Muslims by the hundreds being offloaded by the government and taken into the country by design.
[00:38:06.693 --> 00:38:08.134]  The reporters get arrested.
[00:38:08.535 --> 00:38:10.536]  They're threatening to arrest Nigel Farage.
[00:38:11.676 --> 00:38:13.199]  So he's not allowed to show this.
[00:38:13.359 --> 00:38:15.163]  They've now arrested another journalist.
[00:38:15.804 --> 00:38:21.735]  In New York, the Hindus had an event celebrating one of their ancient shrines that Muslims took over.
[00:38:23.365 --> 00:38:27.106]  Twitter took that down and said, you can't celebrate your ancient shrine.
[00:38:27.486 --> 00:38:28.686]  It upsets the Muslims.
[00:38:29.206 --> 00:38:32.027]  I mean, this is literally a total sellout.
[00:38:32.067 --> 00:38:37.708]  LeBron James supports slave camps in China, making his jerseys, but says America sucks.
[00:38:38.148 --> 00:38:39.188]  I mean, these people are incredible.
[00:38:39.648 --> 00:38:48.470]  But let's bring up what you think in the four minutes we have left happens if Trump does fail and they literally start coming to take the guns and an actual civil war starts.
[00:38:48.490 --> 00:38:49.150]  Can you speak to that?
[00:38:50.370 --> 00:38:56.855]  I know you're an NRA board member, and I know you're not involved in the bookkeeping and the rest of it, and I know that's not really your place to speak as a board member.
[00:38:56.875 --> 00:38:57.776]  That has to be agreed upon.
[00:38:57.816 --> 00:39:03.860]  But as a citizen, and as a patriot, and a grandfather, and as an American, we talked during the break.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.262]  Can you repeat what you said to me there, police officer?
[00:39:06.889 --> 00:39:11.071]  Well, once again, I am not going to speak as a member of the NRA board.
[00:39:11.131 --> 00:39:11.991]  I'm not allowed to.
[00:39:12.051 --> 00:39:21.195]  It's against the law, and I'm certainly not going to comment on any litigation that's taking place right now by freedom haters and gun haters and we the people haters.
[00:39:21.635 --> 00:39:24.156]  I think that summarizes it pretty nicely right there.
[00:39:24.176 --> 00:39:27.397]  But as a citizen, as an American free citizen,
[00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:31.351]  Who bust my ass to be in the asset column every day of my life.
[00:39:31.452 --> 00:39:37.654]  That's how my children, my brothers, my sister, my band, my crew, everybody in my life is an asset to America.
[00:39:38.394 --> 00:39:53.381]  I want to make sure that this great civil rights organization, the National Rifle Association, continues to do their job to make sure that we have and we keep the right given to us by God individually to keep
[00:39:53.921 --> 00:39:55.242]  And bear arms.
[00:39:55.662 --> 00:39:58.963]  I'm not aware of financial maneuvers of the NRA.
[00:39:59.043 --> 00:40:04.765]  I only attend an occasional board meeting when my schedule permits and I bust my ass to get there.
[00:40:05.185 --> 00:40:07.906]  But there are so many board members on the NRA.
[00:40:08.287 --> 00:40:10.347]  I believe in these gentlemen and these ladies.
[00:40:10.407 --> 00:40:11.568]  These are real patriots.
[00:40:11.888 --> 00:40:16.910]  And I believe that the attacks on the NRA are the attacks on freedom.
[00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:18.371]  And how do I do that?
[00:40:18.411 --> 00:40:20.853]  I'm going to buy 100 memberships today.
[00:40:20.873 --> 00:40:22.755]  I pledge 100 memberships today.
[00:40:23.055 --> 00:40:23.615]  How do I call?
[00:40:23.675 --> 00:40:25.957]  Do I call and how does the NRA do that?
[00:40:42.261 --> 00:40:43.682]  I'll tell you what, go to my website.
[00:40:43.722 --> 00:40:47.024]  There's a direct link to join the NRA at a discount.
[00:40:47.064 --> 00:40:50.987]  Go to tednewgen.com and there is an NRA membership platform.
[00:40:51.027 --> 00:40:54.009]  Remember, the NRA is a civil rights organization.
[00:40:54.289 --> 00:40:56.111]  It's about your right to self-defense.
[00:40:56.151 --> 00:40:57.772]  How more pure can you get?
[00:40:59.366 --> 00:41:02.867]  And it's 140 years old, and I know how nonprofits work.
[00:41:03.247 --> 00:41:05.088]  This is one of the beautiful, best ones ever.
[00:41:05.568 --> 00:41:10.930]  If somebody in there did wrong, we were talking during the break, which you're not saying they did, there's no evidence of that, then they step down.
[00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:12.411]  You don't get rid of the organization.
[00:41:12.651 --> 00:41:13.411]  She let everybody know.
[00:41:13.431 --> 00:41:16.632]  She said, I'm going to abolish it because I'm going to take care of the members.
[00:41:16.892 --> 00:41:22.314]  That's like saying, I'm going to burn your house down because Grandpa, you know, ate too many cupcakes.
[00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.829]  Let's put it better.
[00:41:25.029 --> 00:41:27.271]  But really, let's look at the real violators.
[00:41:27.611 --> 00:41:29.492]  The Clinton Foundation?
[00:41:29.953 --> 00:41:31.333]  Planned Parenthood?
[00:41:31.874 --> 00:41:33.975]  The Southern Poverty Law Center?
[00:41:34.035 --> 00:41:36.837]  These people are violators of the Constitution.
[00:41:37.017 --> 00:41:40.259]  They're all violators of non-profit laws.
[00:41:40.559 --> 00:41:46.643]  And we're talking an accumulation of billions of dollars of fraudulently misused
[00:41:48.103 --> 00:41:48.524]  Exactly.
[00:41:48.544 --> 00:41:50.084]  So Trump needs to go on the offense.
[00:41:50.204 --> 00:41:56.046]  Clinton's got billions to sell out our sovereignty, pay for play, and now they're going after America's oldest civil rights organization.
[00:41:56.066 --> 00:42:04.949]  But you did say, if they find anything wrong, even though it's not that big a deal, but they claim you violated this regulation or had too many, you know, dinners or whatever, those folks just step down.
[00:42:05.149 --> 00:42:06.370]  You don't get rid of the organization.
[00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:07.510]  That needs to be clear.
[00:42:08.183 --> 00:42:09.064]  Absolutely.
[00:42:09.104 --> 00:42:11.225]  And again, you know, that's like logic 101.
[00:42:12.306 --> 00:42:17.210]  But again, I'm not presuming or alleging any misdeeds by anybody.
[00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:20.152]  Let the investigation go forward.
[00:42:20.392 --> 00:42:24.835]  But we know that this New York Attorney General hates gun owners.
[00:42:24.915 --> 00:42:28.117]  I was about to say, how can you have Hitler investigate, say, Jews?
[00:42:28.978 --> 00:42:29.859]  It's unbelievable.
[00:42:30.199 --> 00:42:30.979]  You know why they hate me?
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:37.024]  Because I'm Schindler, but I've got a whole bunch of more Jews that I'm saving, and the Nazis hate me for that.
[00:42:38.234 --> 00:42:38.674]  Beautiful.
[00:42:38.734 --> 00:42:40.715]  Well, I believe the NRA said nothing wrong.
[00:42:40.755 --> 00:42:42.315]  I've had them lie about me with financial stuff.
[00:42:42.335 --> 00:42:43.695]  It's total fiction, total fraud.
[00:42:43.955 --> 00:42:46.476]  The NRA does a great job, especially since you got involved.
[00:42:46.736 --> 00:42:48.216]  It's really gotten hardcore and we love you.
[00:42:48.236 --> 00:42:50.017]  We need to get NRA TV going again.
[00:42:50.057 --> 00:42:51.477]  TedNugent.com.
[00:42:51.737 --> 00:42:56.618]  People can find the sports camp and so much more at TedNugent.com.
[00:42:56.658 --> 00:42:58.379]  Ted, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[00:42:58.839 --> 00:42:59.179]  You bet.
[00:42:59.219 --> 00:43:00.439]  God bless America, Alex.
[00:43:00.479 --> 00:43:01.679]  God bless freedom lovers.
[00:43:01.719 --> 00:43:03.860]  Let's raise some hell like never before.
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:04.520]  Beautiful, sir.
[00:43:05.359 --> 00:43:13.725]  I think self-defense can look violent if you're looking at it as the person who responds in self-defense is as culpable, but we don't see it that way.
[00:43:13.925 --> 00:43:17.567]  We see ourselves as engaging in self-defense from groups who want to do our community harm.
[00:43:17.727 --> 00:43:21.910]  The mayor decried the violence, calling those responsible vigilantes.
[00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:29.175]  The police video showed one person dumping out a backpack with what appeared to be frozen water bottles, which were then thrown at officers.
[00:43:29.755 --> 00:43:35.179]  Demonstrators also hurled fireworks, one sergeant suffering a broken eye socket from the shrapnel.
[00:43:35.699 --> 00:43:43.401]  Police said the PVC pipe used to hold the Black Lives Matter banners had been sharpened and were taken out and used to jab at officers.
[00:43:43.421 --> 00:43:45.962]  Do you disavow the violence from Antifa?
[00:43:46.002 --> 00:43:47.843]  That's happening in Portland right now?
[00:43:47.903 --> 00:43:48.423]  That's a myth.
[00:43:48.623 --> 00:43:50.224]  Get wet!
[00:43:50.284 --> 00:43:53.945]  Get wet!
[00:43:54.045 --> 00:43:55.045]  Get wet!
[00:43:55.065 --> 00:43:55.645]  Get wet!
[00:43:55.685 --> 00:43:56.005]  Get wet!
[00:43:56.025 --> 00:43:56.545]  Get wet!
[00:43:56.685 --> 00:43:57.506]  Are you serious?
[00:43:57.566 --> 00:43:59.246]  You'll die out here, bro.
[00:43:59.266 --> 00:44:00.987]  Can you hear that?
[00:44:03.345 --> 00:44:07.088]  Breaking news in the so-called Capitol Hill organized protest zone.
[00:44:07.108 --> 00:44:09.731]  There's been yet another shooting early this morning.
[00:44:09.831 --> 00:44:15.015]  Protesters finished a march back to Cal Anderson Park when they say gunshots were fired nearby.
[00:44:15.035 --> 00:44:20.320]  There were different reasons for Antifa and for these neo-Nazis to be there.
[00:44:20.821 --> 00:44:23.183]  One, racist fascists.
[00:44:27.770 --> 00:44:31.713]  I do not make any differentiation between Neo-Nazis and Antifa.
[00:44:31.953 --> 00:44:37.656]  Just because they claim in their name that they are anti-fascist, their tactics are in fact totally fascist.
[00:44:37.676 --> 00:44:42.460]  One of the people who was created to kill people they don't like.
[00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:49.246]  The other group, Antifa, has hangers-on and aberrant actors within their ranks.
[00:44:49.466 --> 00:44:53.569]  But the groups were not created to destroy parts of humanity.
[00:45:00.015 --> 00:45:02.197]  Antifa is not a myth.
[00:45:02.317 --> 00:45:12.827]  The Democrats' refusal to acknowledge the obvious violence spreading like a cancer from the Trump-hating Soros-funded brownshirts terrorizing America borders on treason.
[00:45:13.268 --> 00:45:16.411]  There was no anarchist violence in Lafayette Square.
[00:45:16.891 --> 00:45:20.815]  In fact, the only ones using force were federal law enforcement agents.
[00:45:21.195 --> 00:45:27.238]  I am standing out the front of the White House and you can see that the building behind me is still smouldering.
[00:45:27.298 --> 00:45:31.320]  The fire brigade has just arrived to try to extinguish that.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:35.442]  They've been kept busy with a number of spot fires in this area.
[00:45:35.482 --> 00:45:39.364]  There was an impromptu bonfire on the street here behind me.
[00:45:39.424 --> 00:45:41.485]  There were a number of cars set alight.
[00:45:41.785 --> 00:45:47.328]  Even a hotel, the front of our hotel, was set alight in what was really terrifying scenes.
[00:45:47.688 --> 00:45:50.389]  This all happened in the minutes leading up
[00:45:50.609 --> 00:45:56.072]  If we had done nothing, what would have happened to the courthouse, Mr. Cuccinelli, in Portland?
[00:46:17.904 --> 00:46:20.025]  That courthouse wouldn't be there in any function.
[00:46:20.045 --> 00:46:23.127]  So I challenge anybody on the other side to say differently.
[00:46:23.948 --> 00:46:28.630]  If we hadn't intervened... Alright, this is a, like, nine minute John Bowne report.
[00:46:28.690 --> 00:46:29.311]  It's excellent.
[00:46:29.331 --> 00:46:30.912]  That's just the first three and a half minutes.
[00:46:31.632 --> 00:46:32.793]  It's at Bandot Video.
[00:46:32.813 --> 00:46:35.874]  You go to Bandot Video, click the left-hand side, see three lines there.
[00:46:36.735 --> 00:46:39.757]  You click that left-hand side, it pulls down all the different sections.
[00:46:39.777 --> 00:46:41.518]  You'll see the John Bowne section there on the left.
[00:46:42.518 --> 00:46:45.200]  Right over there underneath Paul Joseph Watson and David Knight and
[00:46:46.087 --> 00:46:51.230]  David Icke and all the rest of them and you'll find the John Bowne reports right over there on the left hand side.
[00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:55.012]  And you just click on that and you can find his report.
[00:46:56.058 --> 00:46:57.819]  Dealing with all of this.
[00:46:58.460 --> 00:47:04.764]  And the new report, again, is titled by John Bowne, Antifa is not a myth.
[00:47:05.945 --> 00:47:07.606]  And it went up last night.
[00:47:07.626 --> 00:47:09.487]  It only has 14,000 views.
[00:47:09.547 --> 00:47:10.908]  It needs 100,000 views.
[00:47:11.668 --> 00:47:13.269]  It's also on Infowars.com.
[00:47:13.289 --> 00:47:21.075]  But can you believe they have hearings where they explain that it's not good to burn down the federal courthouse or hit officers in the head with hatchets or hammers?
[00:47:21.923 --> 00:47:23.584]  I mean, look, that's insane, folks.
[00:47:23.664 --> 00:47:32.168]  If I tried to assault a cop, a federal officer, a milkman, those don't exist anymore, a random person on the street, they can kill me!
[00:47:32.508 --> 00:47:33.409]  They have rights, too!
[00:47:33.809 --> 00:47:34.729]  That's insane!
[00:47:34.989 --> 00:47:35.990]  They don't want justice.
[00:47:36.010 --> 00:47:46.195]  They want to overthrow the whole system so that Letitia Jameses are in charge of every statehouse and every federal courthouse to rule with tyranny, and then we will have a civil war.
[00:47:48.112 --> 00:48:04.740]  All right, I have been watching the Council on Foreign Relations, the Atlantic Council, and all the top shadow government, deep state groups say, we're going to activate race riots as the smoke screen for our overthrow of local, state, and federal government.
[00:48:05.221 --> 00:48:13.625]  When Trump tries to block that, we're going to call it racist, and it'll be our cover to remove him under the 25th Amendment or under something else.
[00:48:14.994 --> 00:48:28.477]  Then we learned, it was mainstream news, that they were canvassing four years ago when Trump was first president-elect, almost four years ago, and then again this year, the Pentagon on strategies to remove Trump.
[00:48:29.678 --> 00:48:32.659]  Now, you don't just walk into the General's offices and say, we want to remove the president.
[00:48:32.679 --> 00:48:37.100]  They go, if he doesn't leave, what are you going to do?
[00:48:37.260 --> 00:48:39.940]  Well, we want you to remove him.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.021]  Well, what if it looks like he isn't going to leave?
[00:48:43.703 --> 00:48:44.664]  See, that's how they introduce it.
[00:48:44.864 --> 00:48:47.165]  Oh, we need to remove him because he's not leaving!
[00:48:47.426 --> 00:48:49.127]  They're introducing the idea.
[00:48:49.147 --> 00:48:53.049]  You understand?
[00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:56.031]  It's how they broach the subject.
[00:48:56.712 --> 00:49:01.235]  And by the way, they're in the CFR, and now the Washington Post, and everywhere else.
[00:49:01.375 --> 00:49:02.256]  You've had Eric Holder.
[00:49:02.736 --> 00:49:04.037]  You've had Hillary.
[00:49:04.717 --> 00:49:06.238]  You've had Nancy Pelosi.
[00:49:06.559 --> 00:49:09.281]  You've had over a dozen.
[00:49:09.441 --> 00:49:11.062]  Brennan, Clapper, Comey.
[00:49:13.783 --> 00:49:20.589]  They've all been in the news in the last month saying, he's not gonna leave office, we need to remove him.
[00:49:21.490 --> 00:49:26.053]  And if he challenges our mail-in voting, that's election meddling, he must be removed.
[00:49:26.274 --> 00:49:31.198]  So if he challenges our illegal action to steal the election, that's grounds to be removed as well.
[00:49:35.061 --> 00:49:39.205]  And so they're even having discussions, Nadler and others,
[00:49:41.584 --> 00:49:44.388]  Brought this up last week for the Attorney General.
[00:49:47.031 --> 00:49:49.495]  And they said, what are you going to do if Trump refuses to leave to him?
[00:49:51.037 --> 00:49:52.018]  He said, that's preposterous.
[00:49:52.038 --> 00:49:52.759]  That's not going to happen.
[00:49:53.079 --> 00:49:57.846]  Oh, sounds like Alex Jones and Roger Stone are right in your talking points.
[00:49:59.175 --> 00:50:03.359]  By the way, Roger Stone doesn't just come on this show and agree with me to agree.
[00:50:03.379 --> 00:50:04.560]  He disagrees sometimes with me.
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:05.501]  He knows I'm usually right.
[00:50:05.921 --> 00:50:06.722]  I'm just being honest.
[00:50:07.382 --> 00:50:09.784]  He's been right a few times when I've been wrong, but I'm right more than he is.
[00:50:10.004 --> 00:50:10.685]  He's a smart guy.
[00:50:10.945 --> 00:50:12.727]  We rarely disagree, but...
[00:50:13.993 --> 00:50:17.117]  We talk about a lot of subjects, so we disagree quite often.
[00:50:17.177 --> 00:50:22.623]  And by that, I mean, we may cover 100 topics and agree on those, but out of 200 topics, we might disagree on four or five.
[00:50:23.544 --> 00:50:26.227]  Roger agrees with me that they're going to try a coup again.
[00:50:26.247 --> 00:50:26.908]  They've already done it.
[00:50:27.148 --> 00:50:29.211]  Past behavior is the most indicative of future actions.
[00:50:31.820 --> 00:50:33.621]  Past performances indicative of future performances.
[00:50:33.661 --> 00:50:34.521]  That's the number one indicator.
[00:50:35.042 --> 00:50:38.423]  And I mean, they're foaming at the mouth now with the narrative.
[00:50:38.463 --> 00:50:39.524]  It's not Russiagate.
[00:50:40.064 --> 00:50:41.224]  It's not Ukrainegate.
[00:50:41.264 --> 00:50:42.285]  It's not Rapegate.
[00:50:42.725 --> 00:50:44.286]  It's, oh, he's a dictator.
[00:50:44.726 --> 00:50:45.587]  Oh, he's not going to leave.
[00:50:45.987 --> 00:50:47.407]  Oh, he's doing stuff to try to stay.
[00:50:47.828 --> 00:50:48.868]  Oh, we got to get rid of him.
[00:50:49.268 --> 00:50:54.751]  Oh, and then right after we saw that, I said, if you see the top brass, the Joint Chiefs, Milley and others,
[00:50:55.865 --> 00:50:59.707]  The chairman, come out and put Trump down over something petty.
[00:51:00.208 --> 00:51:03.169]  Like, I shouldn't have walked with him across the street to the church.
[00:51:03.449 --> 00:51:04.370]  What the hell does that mean?
[00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:09.913]  Or, you know, we shouldn't put military on the streets to stop rioting.
[00:51:10.093 --> 00:51:11.054]  The president's wrong.
[00:51:11.914 --> 00:51:13.175]  Secretary of Defense said that.
[00:51:14.216 --> 00:51:24.522]  I said to you weeks before, I said if the SecDef and the chairman and others start shooting off their mouths against El Presidente, that means they're signaling to the big boys
[00:51:25.472 --> 00:51:28.113]  The big powerful globalists sold us out that they're scared.
[00:51:28.333 --> 00:51:32.195]  They want to keep that $10 million job they got coming when they leave office.
[00:51:32.695 --> 00:51:34.376]  They want to keep all those deals.
[00:51:34.616 --> 00:51:37.197]  They want to sell us out of the shycoms because they're wimps.
[00:51:38.037 --> 00:51:43.419]  They might have been tough back when they were in Vietnam or when they were Green Berets, but they ain't tough no more!
[00:51:43.439 --> 00:51:47.561]  Because they get a little thing in the mail.
[00:51:48.722 --> 00:51:51.823]  Hey, General Milley or whoever, we know about your mistress.
[00:51:53.643 --> 00:51:55.044]  That lives a mile from your house.
[00:51:55.384 --> 00:51:56.804]  Oh, well, hey, guess what, Millie?
[00:51:57.004 --> 00:51:58.305]  We know about it, too, buddy boy.
[00:52:00.306 --> 00:52:05.067]  And I'm gonna burn down Oprah Winfrey politically, and I'm gonna burn all you down before I'm done.
[00:52:05.247 --> 00:52:08.249]  And I don't care what you do to me, I'll burn every one of you.
[00:52:08.409 --> 00:52:12.170]  So just go ahead and punch your button up and send some illegal team to kill me.
[00:52:12.450 --> 00:52:14.391]  I don't give a frickin' hell!
[00:52:15.071 --> 00:52:19.253]  Because there are some people in this country that aren't cowardly scum like you!
[00:52:23.337 --> 00:52:26.618]  Oprah Winfrey is a pedophile.
[00:52:27.698 --> 00:52:32.199]  Oprah Winfrey likes girls.
[00:52:32.219 --> 00:52:33.519]  12, 13, 14, 15 year olds.
[00:52:33.779 --> 00:52:37.200]  She hangs out with Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:39.940]  And with Harvey Weinstein.
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:44.741]  And she's in a secret cult that came out on the news that wants to depopulate Africa.
[00:52:49.182 --> 00:52:50.462]  That's why she was chosen?
[00:52:52.492 --> 00:52:58.497]  To be the big face of black women in America to lead them into abortion and fatherless homes and death.
[00:53:00.058 --> 00:53:07.565]  And now she leads a Luciferian orphanage cult in Africa with kids, just like Hillary does in Haiti, disappearing black children.
[00:53:07.785 --> 00:53:09.666]  Because I don't know what it is about black children.
[00:53:11.268 --> 00:53:18.594]  But if there's a menu of kids, Satanists more often than any choose black people as the menu item.
[00:53:21.428 --> 00:53:24.249]  Maybe that's because it's easier for them to grab them and sneak off with them.
[00:53:24.489 --> 00:53:26.030]  But let me just tell you something right now.
[00:53:27.511 --> 00:53:33.593]  That woman is an absolute demon from hell!
[00:53:39.356 --> 00:53:44.138]  There she is with John of God, where they have sex with the children.
[00:53:46.199 --> 00:53:49.040]  And boy, she likes to spend her time in those third world countries.
[00:53:50.629 --> 00:53:53.290]  Them little girls, and it's well known.
[00:53:57.611 --> 00:54:06.074]  Imagine being a little 10 year old girl in Africa in some horrible orphanage, and the door opens and in comes Oprah Winfrey.
[00:54:07.874 --> 00:54:14.637]  Why don't we show some of the video of her sticking her tongue in Harvey Weinstein's ear, sucking on his ears.
[00:54:15.177 --> 00:54:18.558]  In public, she's sucking on that guy's dandruff covered ears.
[00:54:19.514 --> 00:54:22.705]  That's the thing with him is he's got this gross body and he's a hermaphrodite.
[00:54:22.725 --> 00:54:25.233]  He's got a vagina and a little shriveled.
[00:54:26.462 --> 00:54:27.042]  I don't think so.
[00:54:54.032 --> 00:54:59.195]  You can probably imagine what an ugly slime bag wants to do to beautiful, innocent women to steal their future.
[00:54:59.535 --> 00:55:01.336]  And to humiliate them and to debase them.
[00:55:01.716 --> 00:55:04.357]  It's as close as you get to sacrificing them or breaking their nose.
[00:55:04.898 --> 00:55:14.742]  In fact, those women would probably rather get slapped around than to stick their face in the dirty you-know-what of Harvey Weinstein's big, fat, brown beaver.
[00:55:15.623 --> 00:55:18.244]  But I mean, that's what all these people are!
[00:55:19.745 --> 00:55:21.906]  Disgusting pieces of crap!
[00:55:23.018 --> 00:55:24.639]  They hate black people.
[00:55:24.879 --> 00:55:26.260]  They hate white people.
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:27.901]  They hate brown people.
[00:55:28.121 --> 00:55:29.282]  They hate children.
[00:55:29.542 --> 00:55:30.623]  They hate women.
[00:55:30.943 --> 00:55:32.484]  They hate everybody!
[00:55:36.706 --> 00:55:42.550]  And they got all these candy-ass cowards with all their mansions and their money afraid to lose it all.
[00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:44.771]  Most of the people in D.C.
[00:55:44.811 --> 00:55:45.211]  and L.A.
[00:55:45.311 --> 00:55:46.272]  aren't devil-worshipping.
[00:55:46.512 --> 00:55:49.654]  Most people aren't making 15-year-old girls clean their fat folds.
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:55.545]  Most people aren't sucking Harvey Weinstein's ears, but they all bow down to him!
[00:55:56.386 --> 00:55:58.107]  Let me bow down to you right now!
[00:55:59.509 --> 00:56:08.759]  Let me hand over some more young, beautiful women to you so you can defile them and rub your butt on them like you're marking your territory!
[00:56:10.589 --> 00:56:16.072]  But we're so close to Oprah Winfrey going to prison, I can't wait till she gets indicted and she's in that orange suit.
[00:56:16.992 --> 00:56:20.394]  And she's going to get all the women she wants, I guess, once she's in that female lockup.
[00:56:20.654 --> 00:56:22.174]  They're just not going to be 14 years old.
[00:56:23.115 --> 00:56:26.917]  Hell, Oprah will probably be happier than a pig, and you know what, once she gets in that prison.
[00:56:28.117 --> 00:56:29.518]  Because she's hooked into all of it.
[00:56:30.258 --> 00:56:33.240]  She runs trafficking, reportedly, out of everywhere.
[00:56:34.340 --> 00:56:35.200]  So hey, guess what?
[00:56:35.721 --> 00:56:37.962]  Gloves off, brass knuckles on.
[00:56:39.201 --> 00:56:42.163]  I don't run up white flags like the NRA when I'm under attack.
[00:56:42.503 --> 00:56:43.824]  I don't bow down to you.
[00:56:44.285 --> 00:56:49.388]  Because no matter what happens to me, every one of you devil worshipping slime bags is going down.
[00:56:49.848 --> 00:56:52.230]  And you're going to go down in this life while you're still alive?
[00:56:52.710 --> 00:57:00.656]  And then God's going to cut you down in the next one and is going to break every spiritual bone in your body and smash you down to hell.
[00:57:00.936 --> 00:57:05.101]  And throw you right into one of those garbage disposals we call a black hole.
[00:57:05.422 --> 00:57:11.389]  So I hope you enjoy the Phantom Zone because it's a real place and it's filled with people like you.
[00:57:14.721 --> 00:57:17.684]  And I know you're scared just like those children are that you kidnapped.
[00:57:18.385 --> 00:57:19.606]  But you will fear God.
[00:57:20.567 --> 00:57:21.929]  And you're already scared Oprah.
[00:57:22.229 --> 00:57:31.239]  So dance around and cause race war and tell us how whites are bad and how they got a leg up and we need to kill the whitey when you serve the real whiteys that want to kill everybody.
[00:57:31.659 --> 00:57:33.241]  So I have a lot of enemies out there.
[00:57:33.281 --> 00:57:35.343]  This may be the last time you'll see me for a while.
[00:57:36.144 --> 00:57:39.886]  A lot of very, very rich enemies, but they are not happy with what I'm doing.
[00:57:40.646 --> 00:57:44.708]  But I figure we have one chance to do it, and no other president's gonna do what I do.
[00:57:45.268 --> 00:57:52.771]  No other president would do a favored nations, a rebate, a buy from other nations at much less cost.
[00:57:52.891 --> 00:57:53.371]  Nobody.
[00:57:54.391 --> 00:58:00.434]  And there are a lot of unhappy people, and they're very rich people, and they're very unhappy.
[00:58:04.909 --> 00:58:08.730]  President Trump fired the bat signal yesterday.
[00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:13.951]  And he said, they make all our prescription drugs in China, they're full of garbage, they're overpriced.
[00:58:14.471 --> 00:58:15.372]  There's all these middlemen.
[00:58:15.392 --> 00:58:17.852]  It's about a third the cost of prescription drugs.
[00:58:18.452 --> 00:58:22.894]  Americans pay more for prescription drugs than anyone in the world.
[00:58:23.574 --> 00:58:27.955]  And he went on to say, we are not going to put up with that.
[00:58:29.595 --> 00:58:31.956]  We are not going to set up one-sided deals against America.
[00:58:35.714 --> 00:58:49.659]  Now, if you don't know about Oprah Winfrey being the black face of forced inoculations, AZT drugs given to children that don't even have HIV that ends up killing them, sterilization, you name it, then you don't know.
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:54.241]  And if you don't know about her and her penchant for little girls, you're going to learn about it very soon.
[00:58:55.262 --> 00:58:57.282]  And by the way, folks, I don't bear false witness.
[00:58:58.343 --> 00:59:03.365]  I have it from the same sources that told me about Harvey Weinstein and many others.
[00:59:04.676 --> 00:59:05.820]  Of what Oprah Winfrey's into.
[00:59:07.304 --> 00:59:11.277]  And if you remember the... The Abingdon Post wrote a big attack piece.
[00:59:12.705 --> 00:59:32.337]  About three years ago, right before the Harvey Weinstein thing broke, and I said, these big Hollywood producers make women do X, Y, and Z. And I told you that they're going to use just the abuse of women as the cover for the actual drugging and kidnapping and murder of women, and the branding of women, and the torture of women, and also little children.
[00:59:32.397 --> 00:59:38.541]  So they're going to use the movement that's happened to women to make it about women only, and not about all the children.
[00:59:40.042 --> 00:59:40.563]  And the men.
[00:59:41.618 --> 00:59:43.138]  They get roped into all of this as well.
[00:59:46.519 --> 00:59:49.260]  Alex Jones' Harvey Weinstein comments are vile beyond belief.
[00:59:50.041 --> 00:59:51.241]  Remember the Huffington Post?
[00:59:54.042 --> 00:59:55.842]  Long before he got indicted, any of it.
[00:59:56.522 --> 01:00:08.266]  Oh, Alex Jones says Harvey Weinstein's tied to groups that brand women and groups that trick women to think they're just going to a bondage deal and then they never get released again.
[01:00:10.796 --> 01:00:11.776]  And of course it all came out.
[01:00:12.297 --> 01:00:17.819]  I was told this by people that are scared and who are not lying and who have proven it to me.
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.621]  Again, Hollywood tried to recruit me.
[01:00:23.742 --> 01:00:26.003]  I did not partake in any of it.
[01:00:29.845 --> 01:00:38.349]  And so it took them a while to go ahead and tell me they didn't want to work with me, which was fine.
[01:00:40.410 --> 01:00:42.211]  And then people said, well, Jones is for real.
[01:00:42.271 --> 01:00:43.592]  We'll tell Jones what's going on.
[01:00:46.674 --> 01:00:51.077]  And it was the same thing I was told by Benton K. Parton, three-star general, former head of Air Force Weapons Development.
[01:00:53.459 --> 01:00:55.961]  That's the real former head of Star Wars, before you ever heard the name.
[01:00:57.342 --> 01:01:00.584]  And that's what I was told by Ted Gunderson, the head of the FBI in LA.
[01:01:00.604 --> 01:01:09.310]  And that's what I sat around the coffee table when I was a little kid, when my dad had FBI agent friends and others that would come over to the house.
[01:01:10.612 --> 01:01:12.635]  And they were sitting around talking about the future.
[01:01:12.655 --> 01:01:16.940]  They're gonna have a one world government and colored money and they'll have a microchip in you to buy and sell.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:19.523]  And I'm like, I'm talking 2, 3, 4, 5 years old.
[01:01:19.964 --> 01:01:22.967]  By the time I was like 6, 7, those guys would come over to see my dad sometimes.
[01:01:23.268 --> 01:01:24.269]  They would, you know, talk about that.
[01:01:24.289 --> 01:01:26.211]  When the kids are really little though, they'd shoot their mouths off.
[01:01:26.592 --> 01:01:28.955]  But I was sitting right there like watching, listening to the whole thing.
[01:01:33.891 --> 01:01:40.052]  And so from that experience, the FBI agents and Dallas cops and some of those guys that my dad knew, you know, had worked in other things.
[01:01:40.492 --> 01:01:41.492]  My dad had a lot of those friends.
[01:01:41.912 --> 01:01:47.453]  He'd been an anti-communist growing up in high school and, you know, local activists and knew all those guys.
[01:01:48.454 --> 01:01:56.415]  And so the government knew all about this before, but now they've gotten rid of most of the good people and they've got all the bad guys in the command positions, basically, and we're screwed, folks.
[01:01:58.255 --> 01:02:01.156]  We're up against a Jacobin devil worshiper army
[01:02:02.964 --> 01:02:09.647]  That uses communism as the operating system, but they're all offshore and exempt.
[01:02:11.388 --> 01:02:18.932]  And we got Dr. Andrew Wakefield joining us with the huge developments on forced inoculation that are now all out in the open.
[01:02:20.151 --> 01:02:29.218]  In fact, guys, when you print me the Google articles, Google comes out with implantable digital tattoos to prove you're vaccinated, and the Microsoft website where they say digital tattoos to prove you're vaccinated.
[01:02:29.678 --> 01:02:31.540]  And we'll also show them, it's insane!
[01:02:31.820 --> 01:02:33.201]  Bill Gates doesn't want that!
[01:02:34.382 --> 01:02:35.402]  He never proposed that!
[01:02:38.124 --> 01:02:42.107]  And see, technically, it's Microsoft did it, so they can say he didn't do it.
[01:02:42.147 --> 01:02:44.029]  That's how Snopes says we're lying.
[01:02:48.507 --> 01:02:52.969]  But we have the articles before this even became news that Bill Gates was doing it.
[01:02:54.969 --> 01:03:05.913]  And of course, we have the CEOs and all these guys and the head of the operations at MIT going, yeah, we met with Bill Gates and he just really wanted some type of digital tattoo that's like in the shot.
[01:03:06.434 --> 01:03:08.734]  We said, sir, the thing to do is put a bandage on them.
[01:03:09.235 --> 01:03:11.095]  And so it just sends in these little glass rods.
[01:03:11.115 --> 01:03:13.016]  They have like a rash, but then it's in their body forever.
[01:03:13.216 --> 01:03:13.896]  They can't get rid of it.
[01:03:14.196 --> 01:03:15.337]  We think that's the best plan, sir.
[01:03:16.601 --> 01:03:17.302]  And so that's what they're doing.
[01:03:17.622 --> 01:03:21.845]  But then imagine, he's on record funding it at at least nine universities.
[01:03:24.347 --> 01:03:26.709]  Rice in Texas, MIT in Massachusetts and others.
[01:03:27.129 --> 01:03:30.051]  It's on their website of Microsoft.
[01:03:30.071 --> 01:03:30.451]  There it is.
[01:03:30.712 --> 01:03:31.652]  And then they're all over the news.
[01:03:31.873 --> 01:03:32.853]  It's insane.
[01:03:33.133 --> 01:03:33.874]  He never did it.
[01:03:34.134 --> 01:03:35.015]  He's not involved.
[01:03:35.095 --> 01:03:37.076]  And why am I going to this when I'm talking about Oprah Winfrey?
[01:03:38.798 --> 01:03:41.660]  That's seen more teenage girl tail than a toilet seat.
[01:03:45.287 --> 01:03:47.269]  Because it's all the same group.
[01:03:47.369 --> 01:03:52.113]  Who stayed for months off and on at Epstein's Pleasure Palace in Paris?
[01:03:52.414 --> 01:03:53.295]  Bill Gates!
[01:03:53.695 --> 01:03:58.179]  Who stayed hundreds of times at his pervert palace seven-story New York?
[01:03:58.479 --> 01:03:59.260]  Bill Gates!
[01:04:00.041 --> 01:04:03.864]  Whose private plane flew into the Big Island by Little St.
[01:04:03.904 --> 01:04:04.225]  John's?
[01:04:05.126 --> 01:04:05.906]  Bill Gates!
[01:04:06.967 --> 01:04:08.209]  Who flew into the Little Island?
[01:04:08.689 --> 01:04:09.470]  Bill Clinton!
[01:04:10.523 --> 01:04:12.044]  The Secret Service are on record.
[01:04:12.444 --> 01:04:13.865]  The groundskeepers are on record.
[01:04:13.905 --> 01:04:14.886]  The women are on record.
[01:04:15.126 --> 01:04:36.939]  But oh, it's fake news, and they have Bill Gates on with one of the richest families in the world, Anderson Cooper, who doesn't tell you that, one of the biggest Robert Barron families, to say, oh, I've never, never, never, never met
[01:04:40.353 --> 01:04:40.873]  Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:04:42.714 --> 01:04:47.735]  No, you just stayed at his house and gave him hundreds of millions of dollars and helped blackmail all these scientists.
[01:04:47.775 --> 01:04:55.218]  And so remember, you wake up to their whole pedophile ring and their corruption, their evil, and what's their answer?
[01:04:56.394 --> 01:04:59.455]  They release this genetically engineered virus they own so they can make money off of it.
[01:04:59.855 --> 01:05:02.955]  They exaggerate the death toll 25 times what it was.
[01:05:03.815 --> 01:05:05.356]  They get caught lying at every level.
[01:05:06.116 --> 01:05:08.176]  Everything they do is a lie, a failure.
[01:05:08.396 --> 01:05:11.657]  Fauci literally threw the ball the worst I've ever seen one throw.
[01:05:11.877 --> 01:05:16.378]  The crew was showing it a few weeks ago when he threw the first pitch out from up in the stands above the pitcher.
[01:05:16.678 --> 01:05:21.899]  I sent you guys the clip if you can roll that in the background of Fauci throwing it from behind him.
[01:05:21.939 --> 01:05:25.800]  He literally throws it like 50 feet wrong into left field.
[01:05:26.809 --> 01:05:28.109]  And they cheer him when he does it.
[01:05:29.070 --> 01:05:29.530]  There it is.
[01:05:29.550 --> 01:05:31.290]  I mean, look at that!
[01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:33.571]  That's like, alright, 30, 40 feet.
[01:05:33.691 --> 01:05:36.271]  I mean, it's just, and they cheered!
[01:05:36.671 --> 01:05:38.332]  Oh, incredible job!
[01:05:38.772 --> 01:05:44.713]  Everything you do is the biggest lie, the biggest fraud, even the pitch is indicative and archetypal of that.
[01:05:45.853 --> 01:05:46.374]  Emblematic.
[01:05:47.714 --> 01:05:49.374]  I mean, it's, it's on, and they cheered.
[01:05:49.574 --> 01:05:50.795]  Incredible!
[01:05:51.195 --> 01:05:51.735]  Oh my God!
[01:05:51.995 --> 01:05:54.536]  I'm surprised he didn't throw it backwards, he's such a Satanist.
[01:05:54.676 --> 01:05:55.836]  He probably should throw the ball
[01:05:56.721 --> 01:05:57.501]  Into the outfield!
[01:05:59.782 --> 01:06:00.262]  We'll be right back.
[01:06:00.282 --> 01:06:00.643]  Stay with us.
[01:06:00.663 --> 01:06:01.403]  We'll be right back.
[01:06:01.423 --> 01:06:01.783]  Stay with us.
[01:06:01.803 --> 01:06:02.203]  We'll be right back.
[01:06:02.223 --> 01:06:03.604]  Stay with us.
[01:06:04.824 --> 01:06:05.324]  All right, folks.
[01:06:05.344 --> 01:06:06.005]  We're back live.
[01:06:07.645 --> 01:06:08.186]  Let me do this.
[01:06:08.266 --> 01:06:12.707]  I'm going to read General Flynn's letter, next segment, ahead of Dr. Andrew Wakefield joining us.
[01:06:12.727 --> 01:06:14.768]  It's up on Infowars.com.
[01:06:14.788 --> 01:06:16.789]  It's posted in the live article page today.
[01:06:17.249 --> 01:06:23.752]  Headline, Trump fires the bat signal, warns America, live attempted coup is taking place.
[01:06:23.952 --> 01:06:24.652]  That's a paraphrase.
[01:06:24.672 --> 01:06:25.973]  We can actually pull the article up, please.
[01:06:27.130 --> 01:06:28.731]  General Flynn issues emergency warning.
[01:06:30.473 --> 01:06:32.394]  Communists are attempting to overthrow the United States.
[01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:36.977]  He gets into how it's a fight against good and evil and how this is it and how it's on.
[01:06:38.358 --> 01:06:44.903]  But the first thing I want to do is go to an excerpt, the full 30-plus minute video is being posted at InfoWars.com.
[01:06:45.304 --> 01:06:49.107]  We have archived it to Bandot Video because they're undoubtedly going to bring it down from Facebook.
[01:06:50.034 --> 01:06:53.055]  And it's a Child's Voice, a very successful award-winning film.
[01:06:53.095 --> 01:06:54.195]  It's been out for a few years.
[01:06:54.735 --> 01:07:01.057]  It's a fictional film, but a composite of real-type things that they reported on happening out in Los Angeles.
[01:07:01.077 --> 01:07:03.177]  So it's kind of what they call historical fiction, is what I'd call it.
[01:07:03.837 --> 01:07:18.801]  A Child's Voice has now been silenced by Amazon because the subject of the establishment and child trafficking, whether it's the Vatican or whether it's John of God or whether it's the connections to Hillary and her foundation that's been caught red-handed doing it,
[01:07:20.003 --> 01:07:23.304]  The lady that was running it, Laura Silsby, changed her name and now runs Amber Alert.
[01:07:23.904 --> 01:07:24.844]  You can't make this up.
[01:07:24.864 --> 01:07:26.065]  So he did a great job.
[01:07:26.205 --> 01:07:33.047]  John Paul Rice, who I'd like to invite on the show, of coming out in 30-something minutes and laying it out.
[01:07:33.087 --> 01:07:34.207]  I watched it all last night.
[01:07:34.747 --> 01:07:37.148]  I was sent it by one of our security people.
[01:07:37.828 --> 01:07:40.789]  And I was already aware of this man and I've already seen excerpts of the film.
[01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:41.910]  I should watch the whole thing.
[01:07:42.650 --> 01:07:46.431]  But that dovetails, when I'm done playing a few minutes of this, with
[01:07:47.779 --> 01:07:51.981]  Mariah Carey's sister sues mom claiming ritual satanic abuse.
[01:07:54.141 --> 01:07:58.183]  And then the other siblings say, yes, it's true, but they won't talk about it.
[01:08:00.884 --> 01:08:03.025]  And what they describe is dead on.
[01:08:04.705 --> 01:08:07.947]  Dead on from my research and like eyes wide shut in what they do.
[01:08:08.787 --> 01:08:13.989]  So this whole house of cards is coming down, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:15.435 --> 01:08:17.156]  Now let's go ahead and go to the filmmaker.
[01:08:18.116 --> 01:08:23.838]  He's been involved in a lot of big movies, a lot of big production of us as an actor and as a producer.
[01:08:24.279 --> 01:08:25.799]  Hunger Games, the list goes on and on.
[01:08:26.199 --> 01:08:31.682]  Here's John Paul Rice talking about the fact that they've now censored his film.
[01:08:32.222 --> 01:08:34.123]  And so now he's going public about what's really going on.
[01:08:34.163 --> 01:08:34.483]  Here it is.
[01:08:35.886 --> 01:09:04.055]  The reason I wanted to talk to everybody here today is because over the course of the last week or two, we have found out without notification that Amazon.com, for which we have six of our movies on there, our film, A Child's Voice, which has been on there for over a year and a half in the UK, the United States, and now 70 other countries, was suddenly, without notification, removed entirely from their platform.
[01:09:04.847 --> 01:09:09.454]  They unpublished it, and they made it not searchable in most of the sites.
[01:09:09.855 --> 01:09:19.269]  We've only tested a few outside of the United States, but the one in the United States, if you put in a child's voice in Amazon.com, you can't find it on the 1,100 pages that they'll give you back on your searches.
[01:09:20.270 --> 01:09:34.008]  The only way that you can get it is through a direct link, and we discovered this because the director's daughter had sent the links out to several of her friends when the Wayfair scandal broke, as well as the Maxwell files being released in the last 48 hours.
[01:09:35.527 --> 01:09:46.170]  And Amazon came back to us, they gave us a very standard, corporate, non-committal response that said, we make a lot of changes, we do this and that and the other, we judge things based on performance.
[01:09:46.670 --> 01:09:50.171]  But they couldn't give us a very specific answer, and we all know what the answer is.
[01:09:51.071 --> 01:10:04.115]  What our movie did, before Epstein was known about in the public, and before Maxwell was known about in the public, is we found a network of pedophiles among a global network of people
[01:10:04.983 --> 01:10:10.067]  Who were selling kids back and forth to each other, trading them like candy.
[01:10:10.167 --> 01:10:11.708]  It goes right in through Hollywood.
[01:10:11.748 --> 01:10:18.033]  If you look at the Daily Beast article, you'll see that Jeffrey Epstein had a pipeline right into Hollywood through Harvey Weinstein.
[01:10:18.073 --> 01:10:19.073]  That was last year.
[01:10:19.874 --> 01:10:25.038]  I've done a lot of deep dives and research into this, and there is a very satanic element to it.
[01:10:25.598 --> 01:10:27.959]  For which we incorporated it into our movie.
[01:10:28.099 --> 01:10:29.400]  Our movie is a feature film.
[01:10:29.941 --> 01:10:31.782]  It deals with two teens.
[01:10:32.002 --> 01:10:43.388]  One who's a homeless, heroin-addicted teen, hears the voice of a child who had been killed at the beginning of the movie, calls out for his help, and he goes on a mission to rescue a girl from these human traffickers.
[01:10:43.849 --> 01:10:50.493]  They come together, and then they stand up to this network in a spirit of love and courage for all of these children.
[01:10:50.953 --> 01:10:52.274]  It's a very beautiful film.
[01:10:52.294 --> 01:10:54.255]  It's been well-reviewed, well-received.
[01:10:54.955 --> 01:11:03.059]  Critically acclaimed by the people that have reviewed it and also many users by the thousands, by the tens of thousands, by the millions all over the world have seen this.
[01:11:03.679 --> 01:11:10.362]  So when we had all of this come up, we went viral with it on Twitter the other day and it exploded.
[01:11:10.942 --> 01:11:15.764]  Because we still have one platform left here in the United States and that's vimeo.com on demand.
[01:11:16.434 --> 01:11:21.281]  What I would like everybody to do is, more importantly, I don't need to get back on Amazon.
[01:11:21.301 --> 01:11:24.244]  I already know what they're going to do, and they've got a stack of lawyers.
[01:11:24.305 --> 01:11:30.873]  But we're looking for alternative platforms where we can release this movie and get it out to as many people as possible.
[01:11:31.554 --> 01:11:34.476]  Our movie is not a documentary, it's a feature film.
[01:11:35.036 --> 01:11:42.801]  And we did this based on all the evidence and the facts that we had learned and incorporated into a story that you get involved through the character's journey.
[01:11:43.501 --> 01:11:45.662]  Their road to redemption is through love.
[01:11:46.303 --> 01:11:53.507]  And this issue of human trafficking, which many people are waking up to today for a variety of reasons,
[01:11:54.506 --> 01:11:57.289]  Is the issue that defines all of us in our time.
[01:11:57.910 --> 01:12:04.458]  The media corporations, the most powerful six corporations in the land, in the world for that matter.
[01:12:05.569 --> 01:12:08.271]  Are all implicated in human trafficking of kids.
[01:12:08.391 --> 01:12:26.245]  And I would point to anybody who wants to know more about that to look at Project Veritas and the leak disclosure of off-air footage of Amy Robach from ABC News when she found out and was discussing in 2016 that they had everything from Virginia Guthrie.
[01:12:26.565 --> 01:12:26.905]  All of it.
[01:12:27.166 --> 01:12:29.208]  Everybody who was involved, they had all the evidence.
[01:12:29.608 --> 01:12:36.355]  Their own lawyer said that when all is said and done, Jeffrey Epstein will go down as one of the most prolific pedophiles in all of history.
[01:12:36.835 --> 01:12:43.602]  And they buried that story to have access to the royal family, for which we now know Prince Andrew was implicated.
[01:12:44.878 --> 01:12:48.320]  They did not have any remorse for the victims in that video.
[01:12:49.041 --> 01:12:59.088]  This is a bigger problem because most people know in that world, and the world that I come from in Hollywood, that it is a hidden layer that everybody knows is there.
[01:13:00.387 --> 01:13:09.091]  When the Me Too movement started in 2017, I reached out to several of my female actress friends who were prominent in LA.
[01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:10.692]  You would know them by name.
[01:13:11.072 --> 01:13:16.094]  Many of them you would know by just their look, because you go, oh, that was her in that movie or that movie.
[01:13:17.135 --> 01:13:18.795]  And I said, well, what about the children?
[01:13:20.456 --> 01:13:21.496]  What about the children?
[01:13:22.457 --> 01:13:24.718]  And the response was, we know, we know.
[01:13:25.758 --> 01:13:26.939]  But they were silent on it.
[01:13:29.557 --> 01:13:30.477]  Alright, let's stop there.
[01:13:30.817 --> 01:13:31.958]  This guy's a really good guy.
[01:13:31.978 --> 01:13:33.478]  He's dead on, very well spoken.
[01:13:33.998 --> 01:13:36.299]  John Paul Rice, big producer, big actor in his own right.
[01:13:36.319 --> 01:13:36.979]  A lot of big films.
[01:13:37.739 --> 01:13:41.540]  And he's made a lot of big films and they're now censoring him because this film has gone viral.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.221]  And it's fiction, but it exposes the establishment.
[01:13:46.541 --> 01:13:47.721]  And so that's where we are now.
[01:13:48.442 --> 01:13:51.622]  And he goes into how the women go, no, no, we know about the kids.
[01:13:51.742 --> 01:13:55.683]  In fact, that's more them being abused than us, but we're not going to say anything.
[01:13:56.244 --> 01:13:57.604]  So they use women being abused
[01:13:59.187 --> 01:13:59.667]  I don't know.
[01:14:13.211 --> 01:14:15.513]  I gave that headline last time when I was up here like 7.
[01:14:16.313 --> 01:14:19.255]  We probably have a better headline, but like, you know, see the video before it gets censored.
[01:14:19.275 --> 01:14:21.576]  But there it is, I'll have it posted, the front page.
[01:14:21.596 --> 01:14:23.657]  It's even more powerful, there's like 30 minutes left.
[01:14:24.137 --> 01:14:28.680]  You want to go see this video, you want to share this video, then you want to go while it's still available on Vimeo.
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.921]  Like I told my wife tonight, I said, I've seen clips of it, it's very powerful.
[01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:35.541]  Because it's the ghost of a child that's been sacrificed.
[01:14:35.982 --> 01:14:37.843]  Coming back and saying, you know, help the children.
[01:14:38.604 --> 01:14:39.304]  It really scares them.
[01:14:39.925 --> 01:14:41.726]  I'm gonna go watch that film tonight and I'll give you a review.
[01:14:41.766 --> 01:14:43.507]  And by the way, I'm doing a special live Saturday show.
[01:14:44.308 --> 01:14:46.229]  Special live Saturday show, 3 to 5 p.m.
[01:14:46.270 --> 01:14:52.034]  tomorrow with some big whistleblower guests from inside the Pentagon with how they're controlling things.
[01:14:52.054 --> 01:14:52.434]  Stay with us.
[01:14:55.076 --> 01:14:56.597]  Welcome back, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:14:57.418 --> 01:14:59.640]  So, Hollywood put a spell on us.
[01:15:01.001 --> 01:15:03.042]  The spell is getting taken off of us.
[01:15:03.082 --> 01:15:15.892]  You know, they got that movie, Get Out, came out a few years ago, where the white girl leads the black guy off to the middle of the countryside because there's this ongoing Nazi cult that wants to transplant their Nazi brains into their black bodies.
[01:15:17.233 --> 01:15:18.373]  Well, that doesn't go on.
[01:15:19.794 --> 01:15:21.095]  But what does go on is
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:26.221]  Weird cults and weird groups trying to trick people.
[01:15:26.481 --> 01:15:28.422]  Black people to go to weird white people events.
[01:15:28.442 --> 01:15:29.243]  I know that goes on.
[01:15:29.683 --> 01:15:31.864]  But also, more often than not, occultic groups.
[01:15:32.624 --> 01:15:36.606]  And they will use young women to lure young men to these things to get them into the cult.
[01:15:37.026 --> 01:15:38.126]  That's what these cults use.
[01:15:38.186 --> 01:15:39.307]  And they try to recruit police.
[01:15:39.687 --> 01:15:40.968]  They try to recruit judges.
[01:15:41.428 --> 01:15:43.509]  They try to recruit corporate leaders.
[01:15:43.589 --> 01:15:48.571]  And that's all this is, is an initiation system to get people under your control.
[01:15:49.807 --> 01:15:51.969]  And so I read about Mariah Carey's sister.
[01:15:51.989 --> 01:15:58.915]  I spent, when I saw this last night, an hour and a half after my wife and kids went to bed.
[01:15:58.935 --> 01:16:02.638]  And it all rang exactly true.
[01:16:04.219 --> 01:16:10.344]  And it's upstate New York, where there's that big coven by NXIVM and where other certain occultists run operations.
[01:16:11.806 --> 01:16:16.570]  Where you hear about the spirit cooking with Podesta, and we're gonna have the kids in the pool for you.
[01:16:16.590 --> 01:16:17.991]  They're kids, but they're there to serve you.
[01:16:19.995 --> 01:16:23.656]  And it's just, man, I'm telling you, that area right up, right north of New York, man.
[01:16:24.836 --> 01:16:25.956]  You look at her sister right here.
[01:16:26.476 --> 01:16:30.037]  And the other sisters and the other siblings go, no, it's true, but we're not going to get involved in it.
[01:16:34.318 --> 01:16:36.219]  So that's the reality of this, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:37.439 --> 01:16:38.239]  And it's a cult.
[01:16:38.959 --> 01:16:39.799]  And it's peer pressure.
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:46.801]  And you got little kids like Eyes Wide Shut, let's pull up some Eyes Wide Shut, at a castle, at a mansion.
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:50.983]  Right in downtown, one of these historic buildings.
[01:16:52.464 --> 01:17:02.653]  And what came out in Ottawa, Canada, with that, have you ever seen the Ottawa Parliament for the, today in government?
[01:17:02.673 --> 01:17:04.034]  I mean, it looks like a Harry Potter movie.
[01:17:04.795 --> 01:17:08.458]  Demons and gargoyles and bathymets all over, totally insane.
[01:17:08.478 --> 01:17:11.681]  It turns out they do secret occult rituals inside of there.
[01:17:11.701 --> 01:17:14.063]  A professor came out exposed and they had to admit it.
[01:17:16.872 --> 01:17:18.113]  The whole thing's a temple.
[01:17:21.354 --> 01:17:23.735]  And they're inside there carrying out the operation.
[01:17:24.856 --> 01:17:25.937]  Everybody's wearing masks.
[01:17:28.498 --> 01:17:36.862]  And they got the police chief there, so what are you gonna do when the local head of the FBI and the local head of the police department are there?
[01:17:38.543 --> 01:17:42.525]  And I've talked to some of these guys off-record, high-level people.
[01:17:45.014 --> 01:17:46.775]  Some of them I've interviewed, but I won't say their names.
[01:17:50.397 --> 01:17:53.058]  And they said, look, I was married.
[01:17:53.318 --> 01:17:54.279]  I was in the FBI.
[01:17:54.399 --> 01:17:55.479]  I was 45 years old.
[01:17:55.519 --> 01:17:56.280]  I was an up-and-comer.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:00.181]  I'd done all these big busts, all these big cases.
[01:18:00.322 --> 01:18:04.003]  And then, yeah, I was cheating on my wife with this hot 24-year-old or whatever.
[01:18:06.305 --> 01:18:09.046]  And then next they come to you and they say, hey, why don't you go to this party?
[01:18:10.694 --> 01:18:15.035]  And then you get there, and then it's something corrupt, and then you say no, and your career's over.
[01:18:15.275 --> 01:18:16.655]  You say yes, your career goes to the top.
[01:18:17.015 --> 01:18:18.236]  It's all peer pressure.
[01:18:18.276 --> 01:18:21.777]  They get you drugged up before they do it, and then you're there, and you're being set up.
[01:18:24.057 --> 01:18:25.537]  That's how the Vatican got taken over.
[01:18:26.358 --> 01:18:28.118]  That's how Penn State got taken over.
[01:18:28.158 --> 01:18:29.978]  It's how all of it, it's how they work.
[01:18:31.339 --> 01:18:34.539]  And they start you off with a chick that looks like she's 25 years old.
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.360]  All the hormones and the food now?
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:36.560]  Hell.
[01:18:38.848 --> 01:18:39.589]  They say, hey, that girl was 16.
[01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:47.434]  It's alright, we're gonna take care of you.
[01:18:47.454 --> 01:18:50.757]  Yeah, that's why I got so mad when they tried to plant that child porn on us last year.
[01:18:52.218 --> 01:18:53.739]  In the Sandy Hook case.
[01:18:56.921 --> 01:18:59.003]  They wanted all the emails that...
[01:18:59.957 --> 01:19:02.819]  We'd ever had about Sandy Hook and I was so busy not worrying about stuff.
[01:19:02.839 --> 01:19:04.841]  We were like saving emails going back like 10 years.
[01:19:05.281 --> 01:19:06.722]  Most companies get rid of them every six months.
[01:19:06.742 --> 01:19:08.283]  Like why are we saving all these unopened emails?
[01:19:08.904 --> 01:19:16.710]  But right after I get sued, we get sent about a month later emails with hidden code in them with child porn.
[01:19:18.191 --> 01:19:19.211]  And we never opened it.
[01:19:22.334 --> 01:19:23.435]  The FBI came out and said that.
[01:19:25.636 --> 01:19:27.478]  But then this law firm run by Senator
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:33.762]  Blumenthal and Murphy, that's just their front group, who've said they want me off the air.
[01:19:33.782 --> 01:19:44.808]  All of a sudden, you know, they call up the lawyers and everybody, and they're like, oh, hey, we found child porn on what you sent us, but it's okay, we'll talk to you about it, we're ready to work something out.
[01:19:47.089 --> 01:19:50.230]  I go check, like, it's some hidden stuff, I never opened it, well, that's not us.
[01:19:50.771 --> 01:19:57.794]  Somebody sent me an email saying, F you for talking about Sandy Hook, blah, blah, blah, and then hidden in there is this,
[01:20:00.219 --> 01:20:01.660]  I said, I'm going to go and I'm going to expose that.
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.161]  Then the phone starts ringing.
[01:20:03.181 --> 01:20:05.923]  The news asked me about the child porn I sent the families.
[01:20:06.524 --> 01:20:08.145]  So I'm sending an email.
[01:20:08.485 --> 01:20:09.306]  I never open it.
[01:20:09.626 --> 01:20:10.147]  It's hidden.
[01:20:13.329 --> 01:20:16.511]  And then I start getting asked, did you send child porn to the families?
[01:20:18.253 --> 01:20:20.334]  And I go on air and talk about it and expose it.
[01:20:20.354 --> 01:20:21.515]  And then there are the headlines.
[01:20:21.595 --> 01:20:23.356]  Jones sends child porn to the families.
[01:20:24.217 --> 01:20:24.978]  That's a total lie.
[01:20:25.919 --> 01:20:35.125]  Of course, the public understands that, because they're sick of me, the whole system is, whoever did that, is so sick of me exposing what's going on in New Haven, Connecticut.
[01:20:35.906 --> 01:20:36.806]  What's going bones.
[01:20:39.508 --> 01:20:40.589]  The devil equals death.
[01:20:41.469 --> 01:20:42.270]  Death equals death.
[01:20:43.411 --> 01:20:53.037]  That they think my listeners are gonna think, A, I've got child porn, and B, I'm gonna send it to the families of Sandy Hook.
[01:20:53.417 --> 01:20:54.638]  But see, they think you're that stupid.
[01:20:56.291 --> 01:20:58.012]  Or it's like a sick joke with these people.
[01:21:02.275 --> 01:21:09.660]  And so then I say, whoever did this, I offer a million dollars to put their head on a pike, and I meant politically, to find out who they are to get them.
[01:21:10.001 --> 01:21:13.383]  They then spin it and say that I'm saying those people did it.
[01:21:15.584 --> 01:21:19.027]  Well, me thinks you protest too much, like right out of Macbeth.
[01:21:19.607 --> 01:21:20.428]  All I know is,
[01:21:22.827 --> 01:21:26.130]  They scanned those emails to find that hidden information.
[01:21:26.170 --> 01:21:27.130]  Why the hell would you do that?
[01:21:29.052 --> 01:21:32.194]  And then thought, oh, we found some child porn.
[01:21:37.298 --> 01:21:39.040]  Are you ready to come out against Trump now?
[01:21:40.741 --> 01:21:43.003]  Are you ready to come out for red flag laws now?
[01:21:50.120 --> 01:21:54.323]  And what's good is, though, ten years ago, people would have believed their lie.
[01:21:54.563 --> 01:21:56.865]  And I wouldn't have rolled over to it, but still, people would believe it.
[01:21:57.546 --> 01:21:59.447]  People know that's not true.
[01:22:02.449 --> 01:22:04.971]  Because the system is out of gas.
[01:22:08.033 --> 01:22:10.195]  The system is dead in the water.
[01:22:15.379 --> 01:22:17.320]  You know, I said I'd get the General Flynn's report.
[01:22:18.701 --> 01:22:19.162]  I'll do this.
[01:22:20.285 --> 01:22:25.368]  We'll have Dr. Wakefield on for three segments.
[01:22:26.949 --> 01:22:35.014]  And then I'll read General Flynn's letter that's so powerful that I should have started the show with, but the president coming out saying, yeah, the evil power elite's coming after me, I may not be here much longer.
[01:22:35.034 --> 01:22:36.555]  I mean, he fired the bat signal.
[01:22:38.637 --> 01:22:39.577]  He fired the bat signal.
[01:22:39.637 --> 01:22:40.518]  He fired the bat signal.
[01:22:41.839 --> 01:22:42.920]  He fired the bat signal.
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:49.584]  That's exactly what, now he should expose who they are, and they should all be absolutely annihilated politically.
[01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:58.746]  And all the information they've got on Gates and Fauci and Warren Buffett and Ted Turner and Hillary and Obama.
[01:22:59.106 --> 01:23:00.107]  They want a war?
[01:23:01.128 --> 01:23:02.209]  Don't know how it's gonna end.
[01:23:04.591 --> 01:23:07.733]  But if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[01:23:11.195 --> 01:23:18.541]  I'm not scared of these people, but I am scared that you're not going to realize how serious this is and sit there just thinking this is normal times we're in.
[01:23:18.741 --> 01:23:19.521]  This is not normal times.
[01:23:19.781 --> 01:23:21.062]  All right, I didn't even plug yesterday.
[01:23:21.082 --> 01:23:21.823]  I didn't plug today.
[01:23:21.883 --> 01:23:23.124]  If I don't plug, we won't be here.
[01:23:24.165 --> 01:23:25.226]  Please buy the products.
[01:23:25.286 --> 01:23:25.986]  They're amazing.
[01:23:26.627 --> 01:23:28.968]  We can't do the free shipping right now because it's just killing us.
[01:23:28.988 --> 01:23:30.009]  There's not enough money coming in.
[01:23:30.029 --> 01:23:33.332]  When we do that, we sell a lot, but there's really not any profit in it to fund the operation.
[01:23:34.032 --> 01:23:35.974]  So we have 56% off on all the supplements.
[01:23:36.674 --> 01:23:37.595]  That's got to end soon.
[01:23:38.495 --> 01:23:39.616]  We have the new liquid turmeric.
[01:23:41.715 --> 01:23:42.996]  We're good to go.
[01:24:04.246 --> 01:24:14.089]  Fluoride-free, enamel-safe, super high quality, no additives, no fillers, charcoal, activated charcoal, toothpaste, and mouthwash that folks are loving.
[01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:16.670]  And it's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:24:16.710 --> 01:24:19.451]  I want to thank you all for your support, and also Cultural Free, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.
[01:24:19.511 --> 01:24:21.412]  But as for me, give me liberty or give me death.
[01:24:21.432 --> 01:24:24.633]  The good news is, I'm coming down fast, but we're miles above the enemy.
[01:24:34.674 --> 01:24:36.616]  And they are burning down right now.
[01:24:37.216 --> 01:24:39.358]  They are on fire with their own destruction.
[01:24:40.078 --> 01:24:41.479]  We're on fire for Christ.
[01:24:42.120 --> 01:24:42.981]  Our fire is eternal.
[01:24:43.021 --> 01:24:44.942]  Their fire is death as they turn into ashes.
[01:24:45.983 --> 01:24:50.066]  And I can just tell you we should be thanking God every day that this is actually a good time.
[01:24:50.406 --> 01:24:51.607]  They locked the economy down.
[01:24:51.647 --> 01:24:53.169]  They started the race work as they're desperate.
[01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:54.989]  And I'm not putting perfume on a pig.
[01:24:55.430 --> 01:25:00.111]  I meant to start the show today with General Flynn's letter about Good and Evil and the fact that what are you thankful for?
[01:25:00.131 --> 01:25:05.412]  And I was going to open the phones up and talk about what we're thankful for so we know what we're defending.
[01:25:06.012 --> 01:25:14.915]  But I'm thankful for all of you, and I'm thankful for this crew, and I'm thankful for my family, and I'm thankful that I got lined up and got the Holy Spirit and I didn't fall to Satan.
[01:25:15.455 --> 01:25:25.122]  Because I came close to it, but let me tell you, Jesus reached down in there and got me by the throat and pulled me up like a drowning man, and it feels good.
[01:25:25.142 --> 01:25:28.165]  All right, thank you for joining us here.
[01:25:28.185 --> 01:25:29.366]  We're now into the third hour.
[01:25:29.426 --> 01:25:36.031]  Dr. Andy J. Wakefield is our guest, and when you define the term maverick,
[01:25:37.236 --> 01:25:41.399]  He's the definition of it, and I know he doesn't want to be praised or anything, but they really tried to destroy him.
[01:25:41.419 --> 01:25:54.308]  Now, about half our stations don't carry this first five minutes, but they got him on early, so I don't want to waste time that we have here, but I'm going to kind of build him up a little bit when we start the next segment for all the folks, the millions, probably two million people that are going to be joining us.
[01:25:54.348 --> 01:26:04.595]  But give us a little prelude, Dr. Wakefield, since you were on with us a month ago, all the craziness that's happened of what's on your palette of paint here to illustrate for us what's happening.
[01:26:06.227 --> 01:26:09.808]  Alex, the new film's just come out and it's having a huge impact.
[01:26:09.868 --> 01:26:22.290]  It's a story about the 1986 Act, signed into law by Ronald Reagan, which gave liability protection to the vaccine manufacturers for deaths and injuries caused by their vaccines.
[01:26:22.330 --> 01:26:28.532]  And it's really a story, Alex, of what happens when you take a product or an industry outside of the constraints of the free market.
[01:26:29.152 --> 01:26:34.473]  You stop the free market operating to select for the best products, the safest products,
[01:26:35.046 --> 01:26:38.469]  You give them a free ride and you pay a terrible, terrible price.
[01:26:39.109 --> 01:26:40.771]  And then you make that product mandatory.
[01:26:40.811 --> 01:26:43.914]  So you've got an unsafe product that is made mandatory.
[01:26:43.974 --> 01:26:45.695]  It's forced into American children.
[01:26:46.195 --> 01:26:48.237]  Suddenly you have the perfect business model.
[01:26:48.297 --> 01:26:50.239]  You have no liability.
[01:26:50.739 --> 01:26:53.662]  You have a compulsory market, a mandatory market.
[01:26:53.862 --> 01:26:55.563]  All you can do is make a massive profit.
[01:26:56.224 --> 01:26:58.226]  That's what the pharmaceutical industries have done.
[01:26:58.246 --> 01:27:01.248]  That's the future of the industry is vaccination.
[01:27:01.609 --> 01:27:03.310]  They have 300 new vaccines.
[01:27:04.088 --> 01:27:11.692]  In the marketplace, coming online, and that is even before the COVID-19 vaccine threat hit us.
[01:27:11.952 --> 01:27:21.376]  And so we live in a very, very precarious world where we are not protected anymore by the constraints of the free market.
[01:27:23.325 --> 01:27:32.968]  And of course we'll recap that and go over all that but it's so sinister with all the health problems and all the autism and all the autoimmune diseases and all the brain damage with 50-something vaccines.
[01:27:33.008 --> 01:27:45.792]  Now there's 300 and now we see all these medical doctors by the hundreds promoting hydroxychloroquine being shut down and big pharma merging with big tech and really a diabolical plan that makes the head spin.
[01:27:47.349 --> 01:27:48.990]  You know, it's what that illustrates.
[01:27:49.070 --> 01:27:52.472]  When you first of all, Alex, it started with people like you and me.
[01:27:52.532 --> 01:28:02.078]  It started with people who were labeled as anti-vaxxers or vaccine safety aware or those who wanted better science or those who were concerned for the well-being of children.
[01:28:02.798 --> 01:28:03.559]  And it spread.
[01:28:03.599 --> 01:28:09.262]  It spread to those who were selling nutritional supplements, those who advocated for natural health.
[01:28:10.006 --> 01:28:11.507]  And then it spread to the mainstream.
[01:28:11.607 --> 01:28:18.492]  Suddenly we're seeing the social media platforms, the mainstream media, shutting down mainstream doctors.
[01:28:18.552 --> 01:28:25.457]  Doctors coming out to tell us about their clinical experience in the front line with the treatment of COVID-19.
[01:28:26.198 --> 01:28:28.880]  When you shut these people down, where does it end?
[01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:29.721]  It doesn't.
[01:28:30.321 --> 01:28:35.685]  And what it does is it tells the consumer, it tells people watching that the single objective
[01:28:36.511 --> 01:28:45.481]  Is to focus on a vaccine and vaccine only narrative for the salvation of mankind to the betterment of who?
[01:28:45.581 --> 01:28:51.828]  To the betterment of the pharmaceutical industry and those people invested in it like Bill Gates and Tony Fauci.
[01:28:52.216 --> 01:28:54.677]  And I know you don't like to speculate, but it's not speculation now.
[01:28:54.717 --> 01:28:55.417]  We'll talk about it later.
[01:28:55.857 --> 01:28:58.478]  Digital tattoos to prove you've had it.
[01:28:59.618 --> 01:29:04.479]  Compulsory tracking if you want to have a job or get on an airplane.
[01:29:04.599 --> 01:29:06.300]  BBC says you'll have a digital chip.
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:07.520]  Put it in you to prove it.
[01:29:07.920 --> 01:29:10.261]  And then they announce it, but then we say, hey, that's a bad idea.
[01:29:10.301 --> 01:29:11.441]  They go, oh, that doesn't exist.
[01:29:11.801 --> 01:29:13.401]  So they try these psychological tactics.
[01:29:13.421 --> 01:29:14.402]  We're going to go to break in a moment.
[01:29:14.702 --> 01:29:18.223]  But what's the best website or best place for people to find the new film, 1986?
[01:29:19.943 --> 01:29:24.170]  Go to www.1986theact.com.
[01:29:25.032 --> 01:29:26.554]  1986theact.com.
[01:29:26.574 --> 01:29:27.235]  Watch it there.
[01:29:27.336 --> 01:29:27.836]  Stream it.
[01:29:28.217 --> 01:29:29.339]  Download it and buy it.
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:30.701]  Order the DVD.
[01:29:30.761 --> 01:29:31.563]  It's coming your way.
[01:29:33.021 --> 01:29:35.722]  All right, folks, we're going to cover all of this when we come back.
[01:29:35.742 --> 01:29:37.662]  And I know as an audience, you've already done the research.
[01:29:37.682 --> 01:29:40.103]  You already know that Dr. Wakefield is telling the truth.
[01:29:40.743 --> 01:29:43.204]  You've experienced it with your own child having convulsions when they got vaccines.
[01:29:43.224 --> 01:29:43.564]  You know it.
[01:29:43.604 --> 01:29:49.526]  But remember, you've got to warn everybody now because people are more ready to hear the truth now than ever.
[01:29:50.126 --> 01:29:57.568]  So tell everyone you know right now to tune in to Bandot Video, Infowars.com, Ford's last show, that local radio station or TV station you're watching or listening to.
[01:29:57.929 --> 01:29:58.949]  That's how we reach more people.
[01:29:59.249 --> 01:30:02.190]  I know I'm stating the obvious, but I've got to remember myself.
[01:30:03.070 --> 01:30:05.091]  At red lights, I'd roll down the window and say, tune in.
[01:30:05.791 --> 01:30:06.672]  I do it at the grocery store.
[01:30:06.712 --> 01:30:07.612]  I do it when I'm with family.
[01:30:07.912 --> 01:30:09.033]  That's how we win this fight.
[01:30:09.053 --> 01:30:10.934]  They try to suppress us, we work that much harder.
[01:30:17.837 --> 01:30:21.319]  How do we navigate this increasingly precarious world in which we live?
[01:30:22.339 --> 01:30:26.241]  In order to understand where we're going, we need to understand where we've come from.
[01:30:27.362 --> 01:30:31.083]  In order to understand where we've come from, you need to watch 1986, The End.
[01:30:33.345 --> 01:30:41.627]  It is the story of one of the most powerful forces in the universe, and that is maternal intuition.
[01:30:42.067 --> 01:30:43.267]  Okay, okay.
[01:30:43.407 --> 01:30:43.868]  No!
[01:30:44.348 --> 01:30:44.648]  No!
[01:30:45.148 --> 01:30:48.269]  This is not halftime entertainment when we've got work to do!
[01:30:48.489 --> 01:30:57.271]  This is a force that has evolved in our species over thousands and thousands of years.
[01:30:57.911 --> 01:31:02.612]  It is far more powerful than anything else that man might have contrived.
[01:31:04.238 --> 01:31:08.321]  It is the reason that we are here on this planet right now.
[01:31:09.362 --> 01:31:15.507]  And if we listen to it, it will be the reason why we are here in a thousand years time.
[01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:26.255]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live and Dr. Andrew Wakefield is our guest here for the rest of the hour.
[01:31:27.472 --> 01:31:32.615]  Now I'm not going to go over his whole background, but he produced Vaxxed, from Cover Up to Catastrophe.
[01:31:32.655 --> 01:31:34.055]  They tried to censor it, it blew up in their face.
[01:31:34.876 --> 01:31:36.937]  Now they've put out 1986 The Act.
[01:31:37.577 --> 01:31:38.637]  It just comes out today.
[01:31:38.757 --> 01:31:40.939]  I intend, again this weekend, to watch it with my wife.
[01:31:42.279 --> 01:31:43.660]  1986theact.com.
[01:31:44.760 --> 01:31:45.481]  You have to understand.
[01:31:46.533 --> 01:31:48.554]  Big Pharma has merged with Big Tech.
[01:31:49.315 --> 01:32:05.144]  Hundreds of prominent doctors we know of, we're getting emails every day from new doctors, some of the heads of virology at universities, the heads of whole divisions at hospitals, are coming out and saying hydroxychloroquine, when taken with zinc, 100% recovery, 99% recovery.
[01:32:07.765 --> 01:32:09.346]  They're getting called up before a review board.
[01:32:09.406 --> 01:32:20.434]  State Senator in Minnesota, who's well-loved and a major award-winning medical doctor, he pointed this out and also pointed out that the death rate's like .037, way lower than flu.
[01:32:20.514 --> 01:32:23.356]  So why is it that... Oh, he's been called up for review.
[01:32:23.836 --> 01:32:25.677]  Well, Dr. Wakefield doesn't want to talk about himself.
[01:32:25.717 --> 01:32:27.418]  He wants to talk about the future.
[01:32:27.458 --> 01:32:29.680]  But 20 years ago, or 18 years ago, whenever it was,
[01:32:31.209 --> 01:32:39.317]  He was all over the news that he falsified the reports, he admits he's a fraud, there's no connection to gut and autism.
[01:32:39.337 --> 01:32:41.959]  Well today we know, hundreds of studies later, he was right.
[01:32:42.219 --> 01:32:43.721]  He never said he falsified anything.
[01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:46.752]  He never said he was a fraud and he wasn't.
[01:32:46.812 --> 01:32:48.553]  He was a trailblazer.
[01:32:49.154 --> 01:32:49.735]  A maverick.
[01:32:50.355 --> 01:32:51.576]  But see, I've experienced that.
[01:32:51.596 --> 01:32:52.437]  It's not about whining.
[01:32:52.477 --> 01:32:54.259]  It's about listeners learning how bad it is.
[01:32:54.799 --> 01:33:00.765]  They go on the news and say, Jones said in court he's a fake and an actor and none of it's real.
[01:33:01.405 --> 01:33:02.226]  Where's the transcript?
[01:33:02.246 --> 01:33:02.786]  Where's the clip?
[01:33:03.147 --> 01:33:03.967]  It's not true.
[01:33:05.123 --> 01:33:05.663]  It's a lie.
[01:33:06.244 --> 01:33:14.188]  They were showing me in a Joker outfit 15 years ago during my divorce proceedings in a custody battle, yelling and screaming about stuff.
[01:33:14.268 --> 01:33:19.170]  And my lawyer said, when Jack Nicholson plays the Joker, he's not really the Joker.
[01:33:19.351 --> 01:33:23.693]  I was being an actor there as a joke, but it wasn't my mainline persona who I am.
[01:33:25.162 --> 01:33:27.883]  So they put him through hell, they took his medical license, he got it back, all that.
[01:33:28.203 --> 01:33:30.323]  The point is, is that it was all a hoax.
[01:33:30.584 --> 01:33:31.764]  And they now admit it was a hoax.
[01:33:32.564 --> 01:33:42.327]  And so the fact that he went through the fire, persevered, and is now one of the main leaders, if not the leader, of exposing this threat to all of our futures,
[01:33:43.243 --> 01:33:48.266]  By the exempt from liability global big pharma system is really a testament of victory.
[01:33:48.666 --> 01:33:53.089]  And so Maverick's a great word for Dr. Wakefield, but a better word is the Phoenix.
[01:33:53.509 --> 01:33:54.670]  And so we appreciate you.
[01:33:54.970 --> 01:33:56.111]  We've got six minutes to break.
[01:33:56.511 --> 01:33:57.592]  We've got the rest of the hour.
[01:33:58.693 --> 01:34:07.118]  Let's get into what you were just starting to get to for some stations that joined us, how big this is and what's coming and the shackling of the medical community that started with you.
[01:34:09.102 --> 01:34:12.926]  I think that this film is about 1986, the act.
[01:34:12.986 --> 01:34:20.934]  It's about the law signed by Ronald Reagan, which gave the industry liability protection.
[01:34:21.114 --> 01:34:30.804]  I believe, Alex, that this law is at the heart of the problems we face globally with vaccination today, which are immense.
[01:34:31.562 --> 01:34:38.626]  It is a topic of discussion around every dinner table, every breakfast table, in every family, in all over the world.
[01:34:38.886 --> 01:34:41.888]  It is this single issue of what do we do?
[01:34:41.928 --> 01:34:45.110]  There's so much conflicting evidence, so much conflicting information.
[01:34:45.770 --> 01:34:49.733]  We see the experts on television, and then we see other people saying, no, this isn't true.
[01:34:49.753 --> 01:34:51.133]  And then we see the damaged children.
[01:34:51.874 --> 01:34:53.995]  People are very, very confused.
[01:34:54.095 --> 01:34:58.838]  And what happened with this act, when it gave the industry liability protection,
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:00.921]  For a mandated product.
[01:35:01.341 --> 01:35:17.793]  And then the government agencies that were responsible for protecting American children conspired with the industry to destroy, to sabotage those things that have been put in place to protect the American people from dangerous drugs.
[01:35:17.834 --> 01:35:18.934]  And who was there at the time?
[01:35:19.094 --> 01:35:19.675]  Fauci?
[01:35:19.755 --> 01:35:21.216]  The very same cast of characters?
[01:35:22.097 --> 01:35:22.657]  Throughout.
[01:35:22.837 --> 01:35:23.638]  Absolutely.
[01:35:23.678 --> 01:35:25.059]  And extraordinary to see him
[01:35:25.563 --> 01:35:28.165]  He keeps cropping up when anything bad's going down.
[01:35:28.205 --> 01:35:29.926]  There's Tony Fauci.
[01:35:29.966 --> 01:35:37.552]  And what it did is to make the industry so rich, so rich that they could buy governments worldwide.
[01:35:37.652 --> 01:35:39.333]  They could buy policy worldwide.
[01:35:39.373 --> 01:35:41.075]  They could buy the media worldwide.
[01:35:41.135 --> 01:35:44.277]  And they could buy doctors and medical training worldwide.
[01:35:44.697 --> 01:35:45.758]  That's what they could buy.
[01:35:45.798 --> 01:35:47.719]  But Alex is one thing they couldn't buy.
[01:35:48.540 --> 01:35:49.621]  And that is people like you.
[01:35:50.362 --> 01:35:53.443]  They could not buy the souls of the American people.
[01:35:53.543 --> 01:36:07.248]  They could not buy... If you saw in Berlin just last week, 1.3 million people in the streets protesting, no masks, saying, we've had enough of this lockdown, we've had enough of this BS, we are not going to put up with this any longer.
[01:36:07.268 --> 01:36:09.608]  We want natural immunity.
[01:36:09.668 --> 01:36:11.029]  We don't want vaccine immunity.
[01:36:11.089 --> 01:36:11.989]  That's resistance.
[01:36:12.669 --> 01:36:13.950]  And that is what is happening now.
[01:36:14.010 --> 01:36:17.351]  And that is what pharma cannot and will never be able to buy.
[01:36:20.086 --> 01:36:29.167]  It's beautiful what you're saying, and it's so true, and I'm going to play this later, but I'm sure you're aware and you've seen, we've talked about it, the two-day conference they had in Switzerland.
[01:36:30.194 --> 01:36:37.719]  On the 2nd and 3rd of December last year, in 2019, with the head of the vaccine program saying, we don't test.
[01:36:38.119 --> 01:36:40.060]  We're just told by foundations what to do.
[01:36:40.421 --> 01:36:42.082]  The doctors, the front lines wobbly.
[01:36:42.122 --> 01:36:43.182]  They've got sick people.
[01:36:43.543 --> 01:36:44.583]  This is collapsing.
[01:36:45.164 --> 01:36:46.685]  Meanwhile, here comes the whole COVID thing.
[01:36:46.745 --> 01:36:52.488]  I mean, that is so huge to even have the bureaucrats saying, we don't know what's going on.
[01:36:52.828 --> 01:36:54.109]  It shows that it's not even them.
[01:36:54.169 --> 01:36:55.030]  It's a group above it.
[01:36:57.728 --> 01:37:04.135]  And the other thing about that meeting is it was really in large part to deal with the growing threat of people who question vaccine safety.
[01:37:05.257 --> 01:37:06.438]  How do we control this?
[01:37:06.498 --> 01:37:07.359]  How do we contain it?
[01:37:07.439 --> 01:37:11.484]  What can we learn from these people who are spreading their message so effectively?
[01:37:12.044 --> 01:37:14.928]  It's spreading so effectively because it's true.
[01:37:15.700 --> 01:37:16.561]  Because it's real.
[01:37:17.082 --> 01:37:18.543]  Because it's happening every day.
[01:37:18.643 --> 01:37:26.512]  We're not sitting in plush hotel rooms conspiring to produce some narrative that suits our profiteering.
[01:37:26.572 --> 01:37:27.633]  It's not that at all.
[01:37:28.194 --> 01:37:34.400]  It is the fact that we are dealing at the ground level, at the coalface, with injury upon injury upon injury.
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:37.604]  There is another way, a better way of earning a living than doing this, Alex.
[01:37:38.365 --> 01:37:43.728]  But for the life of me, I'm not going to walk away from it while there is so much damage being done.
[01:37:44.148 --> 01:37:44.709]  No, I understand.
[01:37:44.729 --> 01:37:47.570]  I'm showing footage of the million plus people that marched in Berlin.
[01:37:48.190 --> 01:37:49.611]  Let me raise this point to you.
[01:37:50.432 --> 01:37:54.374]  Obviously, the vaccines are damaging, autoimmune response, all the rest of it.
[01:37:54.414 --> 01:37:55.054]  It's coming out.
[01:37:55.414 --> 01:37:58.936]  So they double down and just say, OK, we're taking all of society over.
[01:37:59.397 --> 01:38:00.597]  That's going to blow up bigger.
[01:38:00.857 --> 01:38:02.038]  I mean, gut level, that's what I think.
[01:38:02.338 --> 01:38:04.439]  I think this is going to force a massive awakening.
[01:38:04.459 --> 01:38:05.140]  It already is.
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:07.101]  Are you seeing the same thing I'm seeing?
[01:38:08.973 --> 01:38:09.433]  Exactly.
[01:38:09.733 --> 01:38:21.320]  It's fascinating to see how this paradox where vaccination policy as a public health policy should depend entirely on the public, on the consumer's confidence in the policymaker.
[01:38:21.340 --> 01:38:23.321]  When that's gone, when that
[01:38:23.982 --> 01:38:25.083]  Confidence has gone.
[01:38:25.123 --> 01:38:29.166]  When the hearts and minds of the public are lost, what you have left is false.
[01:38:29.287 --> 01:38:36.513]  And that is mandatory vaccination, no school, no private school, no public school, no home school, no medical exemptions.
[01:38:36.953 --> 01:38:42.718]  Doctors and scientists who give these exemptions or advocate for them are pursued and de-licensed.
[01:38:43.283 --> 01:39:00.812]  When you start taking children away from their parents, and then when you start to have this global initiative of chipping, microchipping and vaccine passports, and you can't live in society, according to Bill Gates, without being fully compliant with the vaccination policy,
[01:39:01.602 --> 01:39:03.644]  Then you are dealing with force.
[01:39:03.724 --> 01:39:05.025]  And all you've got is force.
[01:39:05.105 --> 01:39:08.508]  And force, Alex, as you know, is a road to nowhere.
[01:39:08.588 --> 01:39:09.870]  It is going to fail.
[01:39:09.970 --> 01:39:11.952]  And it's just a matter of time.
[01:39:11.992 --> 01:39:16.976]  And that protest in Berlin was one of many and is the writing on the wall.
[01:39:17.336 --> 01:39:18.598]  They wonder why they're losing.
[01:39:18.678 --> 01:39:21.080]  They're losing because they are wrong.
[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:31.166]  That's right, the studies show that they're all in their own little bubble, but now Gates and Fauci admit they're not in a bubble, and they admit that people really hate them, and are calling them Joseph Mingala.
[01:39:31.706 --> 01:39:33.127]  Dr. Gates and Dr. Fauci.
[01:39:33.187 --> 01:39:38.611]  Of course, Gates is no doctor, and they're having to fight the real doctors around the world to tell the truth.
[01:39:38.931 --> 01:39:39.451]  Stay with us.
[01:39:41.392 --> 01:39:43.314]  All right, Dr. Andrew Wakefield is our guest.
[01:39:43.394 --> 01:39:44.474]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:39:44.554 --> 01:39:46.836]  Remember, InfoWars is kind of a major mothership.
[01:39:48.268 --> 01:39:49.829]  We're promoting all these other great people.
[01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:51.731]  Andrew Wakefield has his own big network.
[01:39:51.751 --> 01:39:55.694]  He doesn't need us as essential, but we help boost the great work he's doing that's going to save lives.
[01:39:56.154 --> 01:39:59.376]  But for a lot of filmmakers and a lot of researchers, a lot of people, this is all they've got.
[01:39:59.396 --> 01:40:03.359]  Especially now with the internet, Facebook, Twitter, Amazon banning so much.
[01:40:04.020 --> 01:40:13.687]  That's why we got Banned.Video with now hundreds of videos of scientists, epidemiologists, virologists, hospital heads, you know, Rockefeller
[01:40:15.388 --> 01:40:22.674]  University virologist head and they're being censored for putting out mainline stuff.
[01:40:22.694 --> 01:40:26.096]  Meanwhile Fauci said we'd have a 4% death rate.
[01:40:28.158 --> 01:40:29.979]  It's .037 I was seeing today.
[01:40:29.999 --> 01:40:31.920]  This is insane.
[01:40:32.761 --> 01:40:33.842]  This is absolutely insane.
[01:40:33.882 --> 01:40:35.123]  It all goes together.
[01:40:36.476 --> 01:40:38.757]  With everything Fauci says is a lie.
[01:40:39.358 --> 01:40:41.279]  Everything he put out about HIV wasn't true.
[01:40:41.679 --> 01:40:45.561]  And he's like, the devil appears in this cloud of smoke, you know, in these movies, like, brr, I'm the devil!
[01:40:45.821 --> 01:40:54.226]  Every time something bad's happening, Fauci just appears out of this column of smoke, and he can't even throw the pitch at the baseball game.
[01:40:54.906 --> 01:40:56.487]  I've seen people miss the mound, okay?
[01:40:56.947 --> 01:41:01.070]  He throws it, like, 40 feet to left field, and they cheer!
[01:41:02.478 --> 01:41:06.580]  So he's a puppet, obviously, but who are the interests?
[01:41:07.140 --> 01:41:14.763]  Dr. Andrew Wakesfield, the maker of the new film 1986theact.com that just came out today that is vital for folks to see.
[01:41:15.644 --> 01:41:17.325]  Who's the spider at the center of the web?
[01:41:17.345 --> 01:41:19.606]  Because you watch, as you said, them countering at the UN.
[01:41:20.746 --> 01:41:27.089]  Seven, eight months ago going, our doctors are wobbly, people are getting sick, people are dying, we can't cover this up, we don't do any testing.
[01:41:27.309 --> 01:41:28.849]  That was them figuring out how to cover it up.
[01:41:28.889 --> 01:41:32.111]  They're being reasonable, like, make it work, make it be transparent.
[01:41:32.411 --> 01:41:37.213]  That's what you're saying, validating, but then who's, I mean, we know who it is, but you're the expert.
[01:41:37.433 --> 01:41:38.693]  Who's the spider behind it?
[01:41:39.874 --> 01:41:40.534]  Well, it's interesting.
[01:41:40.554 --> 01:41:41.874]  First of all, Alex, you're wrong.
[01:41:41.894 --> 01:41:43.355]  We do need you, okay?
[01:41:43.895 --> 01:41:45.736]  We need Alex Jones and we need
[01:41:46.272 --> 01:41:46.952]  Infowars.
[01:41:47.092 --> 01:41:53.654]  So that's, you know, in these lean times, filmmakers like me depend on people like you.
[01:41:53.714 --> 01:41:55.355]  So thank you very much for everything you do.
[01:41:55.715 --> 01:41:58.356]  And who is at the center of this?
[01:41:58.396 --> 01:42:01.016]  This is, it's a very good question.
[01:42:01.076 --> 01:42:03.257]  It's not something that I've been pursuing.
[01:42:03.517 --> 01:42:06.978]  You know, you could speculate about that for a long time.
[01:42:07.078 --> 01:42:10.199]  It is astonishing to me, absolutely astonishing, that a man with
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:21.332]  No qualifications whatsoever, purely by virtue of his wealth, is able to dictate global vaccination policy, global health policy and personal choice.
[01:42:21.412 --> 01:42:22.553]  That is astonishing.
[01:42:22.593 --> 01:42:29.420]  And every time I see him on CNN, how much did it cost to get him there to be able to say what he's saying?
[01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:30.422]  It is utterly
[01:42:31.670 --> 01:42:33.151]  And by the way, that's not your speculation.
[01:42:33.211 --> 01:42:38.556]  He underwrites The Guardian, the BBC, CNN, MSNBC, obviously Microsoft NBC.
[01:42:38.936 --> 01:42:40.257]  He underwrites ABC.
[01:42:40.317 --> 01:42:42.559]  It'll say at the end of a lot of shows, underwritten.
[01:42:42.599 --> 01:42:50.106]  I saw a show attacking me, a fiction show on ABC, and it was underwritten by him!
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:57.605]  Yeah, he seems to exert a huge amount of influence simply by virtue of the amount of money that he has.
[01:42:58.165 --> 01:43:00.628]  I'll just point something out, Alex, it's very interesting.
[01:43:00.648 --> 01:43:05.512]  I don't know whether you've detected this, but there's a kind of shift in the mainstream media.
[01:43:05.532 --> 01:43:08.995]  And this is a story from Zero Hedge the other day.
[01:43:09.895 --> 01:43:16.521]  Red flags soar as Big Pharma will be exempt from COVID-19 vaccine liability.
[01:43:16.541 --> 01:43:17.482]  Yes, I saw that report.
[01:43:18.573 --> 01:43:19.714]  Really interesting.
[01:43:19.754 --> 01:43:24.596]  And then the American thinker, the CDC, confesses to lying about COVID-19 death numbers.
[01:43:24.636 --> 01:43:29.258]  So there is a spectator in England saying, hang on, the numbers are crazy.
[01:43:29.318 --> 01:43:32.720]  Just like you referred to, Fauci saying this number of people died.
[01:43:33.240 --> 01:43:34.741]  It's a tiny fraction.
[01:43:34.801 --> 01:43:40.544]  The American people, the British people, believe that their population has been literally decimated.
[01:43:40.604 --> 01:43:43.806]  In major polls, they believe 30 million Americans have died.
[01:43:44.646 --> 01:43:45.046]  That's right.
[01:43:45.207 --> 01:43:47.788]  When it's a tiny fraction of that and no greater,
[01:43:48.396 --> 01:43:52.018]  You pointed out many others from the seasonal flu in many cases.
[01:43:52.078 --> 01:43:58.301]  So, people are getting a very, very distorted statistical picture of what's going on.
[01:43:58.341 --> 01:43:59.421]  But something is happening.
[01:43:59.461 --> 01:44:08.886]  Even CBS News had Gates on and goes, 100% of the people getting the strong vaccine get sick, 20% hospitalized, 80% the other vaccine, and Gates didn't know what to say.
[01:44:10.207 --> 01:44:14.569]  Yeah, and he fell apart in that discussion about the adverse reactions of vaccines.
[01:44:15.126 --> 01:44:17.067]  In the FDA, he just completely fell apart.
[01:44:17.147 --> 01:44:31.456]  And it's interesting to see that now, as the polls emerge, over time, longitudinally, fewer and fewer people are willing to take a COVID-19 vaccine, to the point where it's now, what, over 50% of people are saying no.
[01:44:31.916 --> 01:44:33.257]  Thank you very much.
[01:44:33.277 --> 01:44:34.738]  Yeah, 57% say absolutely not.
[01:44:36.359 --> 01:44:40.322]  We're moving to a situation where people are becoming more and more sceptical.
[01:44:40.362 --> 01:44:42.183]  And you pointed this out, that this issue,
[01:44:42.757 --> 01:44:51.404]  Has actually brought more attention, focused more attention on vaccine skepticism and scientific skepticism than ever before.
[01:44:51.544 --> 01:44:55.447]  And in the face of that, we've got people like Forbes telling us we shouldn't do our own research.
[01:44:55.527 --> 01:44:56.969]  Do not do your own research.
[01:44:57.289 --> 01:44:57.649]  Stop it.
[01:44:58.310 --> 01:44:58.570]  Stop it.
[01:44:58.610 --> 01:44:59.130]  It's dangerous.
[01:44:59.170 --> 01:45:00.091]  Leave it to the experts.
[01:45:00.151 --> 01:45:01.472]  Leave it to the man in the white coat.
[01:45:02.153 --> 01:45:02.373]  No.
[01:45:02.433 --> 01:45:06.496]  And the whole point of the film is that it's a mother's journey into that research.
[01:45:06.736 --> 01:45:08.598]  People have said, oh, your film is anti-science.
[01:45:08.638 --> 01:45:11.120]  It defers to the mother's intuition.
[01:45:11.837 --> 01:45:13.498]  That is a very, very powerful force.
[01:45:13.578 --> 01:45:17.801]  But that intuition does not say to her, do not vaccinate.
[01:45:18.041 --> 01:45:19.702]  It says to her, there is an issue here.
[01:45:19.742 --> 01:45:22.524]  There is something going on that I need to get to the bottom of.
[01:45:22.624 --> 01:45:24.506]  And I'm going to analyze the science.
[01:45:24.546 --> 01:45:25.606]  I'm going to read the science.
[01:45:25.967 --> 01:45:27.548]  I'm going to access the legal cases.
[01:45:27.628 --> 01:45:31.210]  I am going to pull this apart until I can come to a conclusion.
[01:45:31.610 --> 01:45:35.553]  If it had simply said, oh, this woman's intuition said, don't vaccinate.
[01:45:35.573 --> 01:45:37.935]  But it turns out after your groundbreaking research,
[01:45:39.195 --> 01:45:45.297]  20 years ago, correct me on the date, Gates then funds, last time I saw, $4 billion into gut vaccine research.
[01:45:45.637 --> 01:45:48.037]  What's he spending $4 billion on that last time I saw?
[01:45:48.057 --> 01:45:50.138]  I know, I don't know.
[01:45:50.158 --> 01:45:51.038]  That's a new one on me.
[01:45:51.078 --> 01:45:52.158]  That's very, very interesting.
[01:45:52.178 --> 01:45:53.199]  Oh, no, guys, pull it up for him.
[01:45:53.259 --> 01:45:55.499]  Bill Gates invests heavily in gut flora research.
[01:45:55.799 --> 01:45:56.880]  Oh, he's heavy into that.
[01:45:56.900 --> 01:45:57.740]  Oh, he's huge.
[01:45:58.860 --> 01:45:59.700]  Oh, good, good, good.
[01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:00.400]  Well, he's learning.
[01:46:00.681 --> 01:46:01.721]  Maybe a little too late.
[01:46:01.901 --> 01:46:05.662]  I think he wants to make money off of what he's already caused.
[01:46:05.682 --> 01:46:06.182]  That's what I think.
[01:46:07.079 --> 01:46:14.023]  Yes, I think that what they're doing is they're realizing the validity of the work that was done way back then, and they're starting to capitalize on it.
[01:46:14.123 --> 01:46:18.306]  So they've got people looking at new markets, and this is clearly a big new market.
[01:46:19.107 --> 01:46:30.934]  The sadness, Alex, is if the work had been allowed to continue at a natural pace early on, we would have had so many more answers today, so many fewer sick children as a consequence.
[01:46:32.615 --> 01:46:33.035]  There it is.
[01:46:33.195 --> 01:46:35.277]  Microbiome research gets the Gates fund.
[01:46:35.799 --> 01:46:36.820]  And that's only one of them.
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:39.141]  The last number I saw was like four billion he'd given.
[01:46:39.481 --> 01:46:40.502]  That's all I do is read this stuff.
[01:46:40.522 --> 01:46:42.263]  I'm not a doctor like you, but I'm obsessed with it.
[01:46:42.303 --> 01:46:43.443]  And here's what happened to me.
[01:46:43.464 --> 01:46:44.844]  I already knew a lot of this.
[01:46:44.904 --> 01:46:50.868]  I interviewed you and stuff, but I go on vacation and I go to the pool and like a third of the boys can't talk.
[01:46:51.108 --> 01:46:52.109]  And I go, what happened to your son?
[01:46:52.129 --> 01:46:55.711]  And they go, well, at 18 months, he got the third round and had a convulsion, never talked again.
[01:46:56.371 --> 01:46:58.553]  And the kid's 7 years old wearing diapers at the pool.
[01:46:58.813 --> 01:47:07.719]  And then sometimes I'm in a pool with like 40 people and there's like 6 boys that are autistic going, you know, yelling, screaming.
[01:47:07.759 --> 01:47:08.840]  I've got Mike Judge.
[01:47:08.900 --> 01:47:09.500]  I'm friends with him.
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:10.481]  His son's autistic.
[01:47:10.721 --> 01:47:12.923]  I mean, I just, I take my kids to movie theaters.
[01:47:12.963 --> 01:47:15.624]  Sometimes I can't watch the film because there's so much screaming and yelling.
[01:47:15.885 --> 01:47:17.085]  I'm not against the autistic kids.
[01:47:17.125 --> 01:47:17.626]  I love them.
[01:47:17.866 --> 01:47:23.970]  But man, when I was a kid, you didn't have, out of 50 kids in a movie theater, 14 of them screaming like they were dying.
[01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.711]  I mean, this is bad.
[01:47:26.069 --> 01:47:27.490]  Yeah, 1 in 10,000 children.
[01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:30.553]  You know, when I was in medical school, we weren't even taught about it.
[01:47:30.593 --> 01:47:31.193]  It was so rare.
[01:47:31.213 --> 01:47:36.198]  Sure, I just meant, I know that, yeah, I know they say it was 1 in 30,000 and now it's 1 in 80 or whatever.
[01:47:36.598 --> 01:47:37.539]  I go to the movies.
[01:47:37.679 --> 01:47:38.340]  I go to the mall.
[01:47:39.591 --> 01:47:44.115]  And the kids who aren't totally autistic still look like somebody beat them up on the side of the head with a baseball bat.
[01:47:44.656 --> 01:47:47.358]  And so all I'm saying is, is that these kids don't look like my kids.
[01:47:47.838 --> 01:47:50.981]  My kids haven't had any shots and people go, what's going on with your kids?
[01:47:51.262 --> 01:47:53.023]  They're, they're like so smart or so great.
[01:47:53.383 --> 01:47:55.345]  And it's because they haven't had this.
[01:47:55.666 --> 01:47:56.927]  We'll stay right there, Dr. Wakefield.
[01:47:56.947 --> 01:48:01.951]  Let's talk about the film, how people save children and where you think this confrontation is going.
[01:48:01.971 --> 01:48:02.452]  1986theact.com.
[01:48:06.144 --> 01:48:07.865]  I'll be watching it tomorrow night.
[01:48:08.205 --> 01:48:10.765]  I'm going to watch the film Amazon banned on pedophilia tonight.
[01:48:12.066 --> 01:48:23.889]  Dr. Andrew Wakefield has been a medical doctor that pioneered, from what the mothers told him in his own testing, that it was something called an autoimmune response in the gut that was then causing something in the brain.
[01:48:23.909 --> 01:48:28.791]  We of course know the brain is connected to the spinal cord to the gut and the two things are absolutely connected.
[01:48:29.758 --> 01:48:31.260]  When you get angry or hungry.
[01:48:31.841 --> 01:48:32.882]  Hangry is the word, I guess.
[01:48:33.723 --> 01:48:34.504]  And all the other things.
[01:48:34.925 --> 01:48:38.769]  What type of studies now have come out that have really validated you?
[01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:41.012]  That's why they don't even attack you that much anymore, I see.
[01:48:41.353 --> 01:48:44.236]  They try to censor you because you've been so validated.
[01:48:44.256 --> 01:48:47.240]  I mean, the story of what... I mean, I know you don't make a film about yourself.
[01:48:48.007 --> 01:48:56.389]  And some of it's in facts, but I mean, Hollywood movies, fiction movies could not capture the incredible tribulations you've gone through.
[01:48:56.889 --> 01:49:04.011]  And then for others going through attacks for telling the truth, your big spiritual, not awakening, but emboldenment that you had in Texas.
[01:49:04.031 --> 01:49:04.831]  Look up at that night sky.
[01:49:04.871 --> 01:49:05.331]  It's beautiful.
[01:49:05.371 --> 01:49:06.592]  So speak to that.
[01:49:06.612 --> 01:49:08.292]  And for the next two segments, you've got the floor.
[01:49:09.092 --> 01:49:11.813]  Don't pause or I'll take over other points you want to make for people.
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:14.661]  You're very kind, Alex.
[01:49:15.121 --> 01:49:18.724]  First of all to say I'm just on the Hollywood front and movies about my life.
[01:49:18.884 --> 01:49:36.418]  I saw that the screenwriter of the film Contagion, made by Soderbergh, directed by Soderbergh the other day, was in the Hollywood Reporter saying that a movie should be made about me during these troubled Covid-19 times to tell the world about my crimes.
[01:49:38.997 --> 01:49:41.078]  The terrible things that I did.
[01:49:41.118 --> 01:49:43.419]  And by the way, to interrupt, I said I would interrupt.
[01:49:43.459 --> 01:49:45.319]  Just a month ago, I re-watched Contagion.
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:50.462]  It's like a blueprint for the lockdowns of the general public, the masks, the forced inoculations.
[01:49:50.942 --> 01:49:54.923]  I mean, this is literally, I saw that as like a blueprint of what they're doing.
[01:49:54.963 --> 01:49:57.485]  So the guy that made that is saying you're the bad guy.
[01:49:57.525 --> 01:49:57.945]  Incredible.
[01:49:59.065 --> 01:50:01.346]  Well, it's an interesting story and I'll just share this with you.
[01:50:01.386 --> 01:50:01.906]  Go ahead.
[01:50:02.647 --> 01:50:05.588]  But David Kirby, my friend, wrote a book
[01:50:06.900 --> 01:50:23.707]  called Evidence of Harm and it was about the corruption of the data in relation to the mercury preservative in vaccines where the CDC found an effect, a very strong effect for mercury causing neurological injury including autism and covered it up.
[01:50:23.767 --> 01:50:25.408]  It was an extraordinary fraud.
[01:50:26.048 --> 01:50:34.092]  He wrote about it in a book called Evidence of Harm and that was optioned by participant studios to make a movie.
[01:50:34.858 --> 01:50:38.221]  It was then put in the bottom drawer and buried and never reappeared.
[01:50:38.821 --> 01:50:47.387]  And lo and behold, Participant took place, took part, in Soderbergh's movie Contagion.
[01:50:47.588 --> 01:50:51.430]  That seems to have been, in some people's minds, the payback.
[01:50:51.931 --> 01:50:56.774]  The payback that Participant received for burying David Kirby's book.
[01:50:56.814 --> 01:51:00.917]  Now I'm not sure as to, you know, do we have a chapter and verse on that?
[01:51:00.998 --> 01:51:01.958]  Can we, can I prove it?
[01:51:02.018 --> 01:51:02.258]  No.
[01:51:02.919 --> 01:51:04.220]  But that is a story that
[01:51:05.219 --> 01:51:16.128]  Given my experience of the way in which Hollywood is very much tied in to pharma and big tech, it would not surprise me in the least if that turned out to be true.
[01:51:16.148 --> 01:51:31.261]  Now, as to the relationship between the gut and the brain, that's right, at the time it was somewhat challenging to a lot of people to suggest that we are one, that something happening in our gut might affect our brain, and it's gone so much further
[01:51:31.997 --> 01:51:46.833]  Now, then we reached, we said, you know, we triggered the process, perhaps, but it's really gone a very long way to the point where we realize the extraordinary importance for our well-being, our survival, our health of the microbiome.
[01:51:47.534 --> 01:51:49.396]  Historically, as you know, in the times of
[01:51:49.966 --> 01:51:56.071]  Louis Pasteur, the microbe, the bacteria, was an enemy, an enemy to be defeated, an enemy that caused disease.
[01:51:56.111 --> 01:51:57.852]  It was a question of perception.
[01:51:57.932 --> 01:52:08.321]  And at the time, you know, when you had rampant neurosyphilis and gangrene on the battlefield and these kinds of things, you could see that it was entirely reasonable to see the microbe as an enemy.
[01:52:09.121 --> 01:52:16.387]  But over the years, we've learned that, in fact, we are nine-tenths bacteria, one-tenth human.
[01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:23.813]  And our very survival is dependent upon the integrity and health of the bacteria.
[01:52:23.853 --> 01:52:25.794]  So we're really a colony organism.
[01:52:25.974 --> 01:52:28.595]  That's why probiotics and everything is now becoming the whole future.
[01:52:29.575 --> 01:52:30.216]  Absolutely.
[01:52:30.316 --> 01:52:40.940]  And what we've learned is that gut bacteria and the health of gut bacteria are important, are crucial for our brain development from the very beginning.
[01:52:41.681 --> 01:52:44.222]  For our behavior, for our emotions.
[01:52:44.977 --> 01:52:47.798]  For the way in which we react and respond.
[01:52:47.818 --> 01:52:50.719]  We really are what we eat, and we are the bacteria that live in us.
[01:52:51.459 --> 01:52:51.819]  We are.
[01:52:51.899 --> 01:52:53.420]  No man is an island, Alex.
[01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:54.620]  That's the thing to remember.
[01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:57.901]  We are dependent upon the integrity of our bacteria.
[01:52:58.001 --> 01:53:12.126]  Once we realize that, realize that they're not the enemy, and appreciate them, feed them, cultivate them, look after them, to achieve the optimal... It's like our body, our skeleton, our genetic code is the earth, but then all these things live on it.
[01:53:13.393 --> 01:53:13.854]  That's right.
[01:53:13.914 --> 01:53:31.777]  And what is even more interesting, of course, is if you go back even further in evolutionary history, you find that man and microbe fused at a very early point when the mitochondria, the energy source of all cells in the body, are actually bacteria.
[01:53:32.586 --> 01:53:41.688]  And they cultivated single cell organisms and gave them the oxidative energy capacity to turn into multicellular organisms that evolved into humans.
[01:53:41.728 --> 01:53:46.789]  Which again is a colony organism and expanding on that, he goes back to women.
[01:53:46.949 --> 01:53:49.029]  Why do women have the mitochondrial DNA?
[01:53:49.069 --> 01:53:49.469]  We don't.
[01:53:49.569 --> 01:53:52.730]  Truly women are the only whole human because they have both.
[01:53:54.250 --> 01:53:54.810]  Yes they are.
[01:53:54.890 --> 01:53:59.791]  In many ways women are the only whole human and they're constantly reminding me about that.
[01:54:00.455 --> 01:54:04.877]  Well, I'm not saying that to kiss their ass, I'm just saying, women have the mitochondrial DNA, men don't.
[01:54:05.998 --> 01:54:07.599]  And science goes, oh, that's junk!
[01:54:07.919 --> 01:54:10.301]  But now they're learning it's not junk, there's something else there.
[01:54:11.901 --> 01:54:25.309]  Yes, and as this film points out, women also have an extraordinary capacity to register when their babies are well and ill, and what's right for them, what's wrong, and they've allowed the medical profession to usurp that.
[01:54:26.594 --> 01:54:29.957]  That maternal intuition which we need to take back.
[01:54:30.438 --> 01:54:34.682]  That internal authority that women need to re-exert collectively and individually.
[01:54:34.702 --> 01:54:37.545]  Because isn't that the racial super group consciousness computer?
[01:54:37.565 --> 01:54:39.787]  Sorry, say that again Alex?
[01:54:40.048 --> 01:54:44.753]  The racial consciousness kind of super computer of the species.
[01:54:45.822 --> 01:54:46.322]  Absolutely.
[01:54:47.063 --> 01:54:48.723]  And it's an extraordinarily powerful thing.
[01:54:48.763 --> 01:54:49.944]  People say it's anti-science.
[01:54:50.004 --> 01:54:50.744]  It's not anti-science.
[01:54:50.764 --> 01:54:52.565]  We simply do not understand it.
[01:54:52.625 --> 01:54:55.766]  We haven't taken the trouble to investigate it and understand it.
[01:54:55.906 --> 01:54:59.008]  But it's as real as any science you will ever read.
[01:54:59.288 --> 01:55:01.769]  And it is the reason for our survival.
[01:55:01.809 --> 01:55:04.210]  It is the reason that we are here on this earth today.
[01:55:04.330 --> 01:55:08.392]  So I have come to learn and appreciate a great deal about the power.
[01:55:09.111 --> 01:55:10.292]  of that maternal intuition.
[01:55:10.552 --> 01:55:15.354]  It's not an emotional argument, it's not an emotive argument, it is a survival imperative.
[01:55:15.434 --> 01:55:15.954]  Absolutely.
[01:55:16.034 --> 01:55:27.300]  Tell me from your research, as a leading person in the general research of this, what these so-called DNA, rDNA vaccines that go into the nuclei, it's not like a regular vaccine is it?
[01:55:28.640 --> 01:55:29.081]  No, it's not.
[01:55:29.161 --> 01:55:30.221]  It's extremely worrying.
[01:55:30.621 --> 01:55:31.942]  Regular vaccines, and this is
[01:55:33.126 --> 01:55:34.567]  An interesting story in itself.
[01:55:34.707 --> 01:55:44.253]  Live viral vaccines in particular depended for a very, very long time upon being cultivated, cultured in the laboratory in animal cells.
[01:55:44.433 --> 01:55:54.500]  And one of the great catastrophes of that is that in those cells there were viruses that were harmless to the native animal but deadly for human beings.
[01:55:55.260 --> 01:56:01.464]  And so that we made polio in cells contaminated with monkey cancer viruses.
[01:56:02.567 --> 01:56:08.009]  We made rotavirus vaccine in cells that contain pig viruses.
[01:56:08.669 --> 01:56:24.653]  And these viruses, when they jump species, like the Wuhan virus, when it comes from one source into a human, it can have devastating impacts, particularly when it's manipulated in the laboratory to enhance the deadliness of that impact.
[01:56:25.367 --> 01:56:42.359]  This is called zoonosis and it has been a plague for live viral vaccines forever and one way of getting around that now because the authorities realize it they've tried to cover it up time and time again but they realize it's a problem so now they are circumventing that by creating
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:45.962]  Naked RNA and DNA vaccines.
[01:56:46.042 --> 01:56:48.704]  Your body acts as the cell culture system.
[01:56:48.804 --> 01:56:54.147]  They put the RNA in, it gets into cells, and it encodes for proteins.
[01:56:54.527 --> 01:56:56.409]  Proteins are transcribed from that.
[01:56:56.889 --> 01:57:00.071]  You're talking real guinea pig Russian roulette.
[01:57:00.912 --> 01:57:01.792]  Very, very worrying.
[01:57:01.832 --> 01:57:03.613]  Because once it's in Alex, you can't get it out.
[01:57:04.214 --> 01:57:09.197]  Let's say you put in a piece of RNA from a virus that then generates an immune response.
[01:57:10.444 --> 01:57:17.068]  Six months down the line, that person starts to develop a tragic autoimmune disease, demyelination, inflammatory bowel disease.
[01:57:17.088 --> 01:57:17.428]  Stay there.
[01:57:17.468 --> 01:57:18.009]  Let's come back.
[01:57:18.069 --> 01:57:19.269]  This is the most important thing yet.
[01:57:19.650 --> 01:57:28.275]  Because Gates says, oh, we're going to have massive illnesses, and they say 80% in the regular vaccine are getting sick, 20% hospital, 100% taking the souped up one.
[01:57:28.615 --> 01:57:29.916]  He'll decode it straight ahead, folks.
[01:57:29.936 --> 01:57:31.177]  This is life and death for all of us.
[01:57:31.437 --> 01:57:32.798]  These are mad scientists out of control.
[01:57:32.838 --> 01:57:34.539]  Dr. Andrew Wakefield is our guest.
[01:57:34.579 --> 01:57:36.440]  We'll tell you how to find his new film when we come back.
[01:57:36.540 --> 01:57:38.721]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:57:38.781 --> 01:57:39.902]  Please tell folks to tune in now.
[01:57:40.202 --> 01:57:40.943]  This is life and death.
[01:57:43.925 --> 01:57:45.366]  A war on for your mind.
[01:57:46.767 --> 01:57:51.330]  You know, the ancient Greeks believed in spontaneous generation.
[01:57:52.170 --> 01:57:57.174]  They'd look down a little pool of water, a foot deep, five feet wide, and they'd suddenly see little fish in it.
[01:57:57.754 --> 01:58:00.816]  They didn't know that a bird landed in it, drank some water, and had fish eggs on its legs.
[01:58:01.357 --> 01:58:05.540]  They just saw it generate a piece of meat out in the field, a couple days later had maggots on it.
[01:58:05.560 --> 01:58:06.921]  They thought it was spontaneous generation.
[01:58:07.813 --> 01:58:09.994]  And then later they thought he put leeches on people that saved him.
[01:58:10.014 --> 01:58:12.836]  George Washington got bled to death by his family doctor.
[01:58:13.877 --> 01:58:20.221]  And then, as our guest Dr. Wakefield was saying a couple hundred years ago, they thought it's germs because they can see things coming from outside.
[01:58:20.261 --> 01:58:23.923]  They didn't know that sometimes there's bad germs like bubonic plague or smallpox.
[01:58:24.284 --> 01:58:26.285]  Sometimes there's good germs almost in every case.
[01:58:27.946 --> 01:58:30.888]  And so we sit here with Big Pharma doubling down with their agenda.
[01:58:32.754 --> 01:58:36.637]  And now Bill Gates is probably the most hated man in the world.
[01:58:36.677 --> 01:58:39.980]  I mean, I can drive down the street and go, F Bill Gates, arrest Bill Gates.
[01:58:40.741 --> 01:58:44.364]  And the average Austinite goes, yeah, liberal, conservative, you name it.
[01:58:45.919 --> 01:58:52.365]  How is this corrupt Microsoft head, who's famously corrupt and bad, telling us he's our doctor?
[01:58:52.845 --> 01:58:53.766]  No one is buying it.
[01:58:54.026 --> 01:58:57.829]  I don't want to be over positive here, Dr. Wakefield, but I got to tell you, I think they've jumped the shark.
[01:58:57.849 --> 01:59:03.955]  I want you to speak to that, what people can do, how important the film is, because again, our biggest problem is we get
[01:59:05.185 --> 01:59:09.008]  We're kind of a normalcy bias that this show's awake, you're awake.
[01:59:09.288 --> 01:59:11.710]  But there are new listeners tuning in every millisecond.
[01:59:12.131 --> 01:59:13.712]  They need to know this is a big fight.
[01:59:14.012 --> 01:59:16.294]  Big Pharma's not backing down, they're doubling down.
[01:59:16.314 --> 01:59:24.101]  So can you speak to what you think of Fauci and Gates being in a lot of trouble and then finish up with what we should do and then get back into these so-called new vaccines?
[01:59:24.121 --> 01:59:28.284]  Because when I call the 357 Magnum the new vaccine and it's shot in the head with lead,
[01:59:29.645 --> 01:59:36.346]  The new vaccines aren't even what the old vaccines were, so the vaccine is just something put in our body by Big Pharma and by the state.
[01:59:37.786 --> 01:59:39.107]  Maybe I should deal with that first.
[01:59:39.487 --> 01:59:39.847]  Yeah, do it.
[01:59:40.527 --> 01:59:42.187]  Because we were right there, Alex.
[01:59:42.267 --> 01:59:54.369]  We were talking about that, and we were talking about the long-term, the medium to long-term dangers of these genetically manipulated, these Frankenstein vaccines that have never been used in humans before.
[01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:58.690]  But there was an example, and as you know, with the dengue
[01:59:59.860 --> 02:00:03.943]  The Dengue fever virus vaccine in children in the Far East.
[02:00:04.003 --> 02:00:13.570]  And they developed this vaccine which was one genetic backbone, one virus with other virus, the Dengue virus, added to that.
[02:00:13.630 --> 02:00:20.074]  So a true Frankenstein vaccine, something that had never been seen before in the natural world.
[02:00:20.875 --> 02:00:23.877]  And they injected it into lots of people, lots and lots of children.
[02:00:23.937 --> 02:00:28.000]  It got through approval based upon the data that they'd given to the regulators.
[02:00:28.780 --> 02:00:32.461]  And it was given to hundreds of thousands of children, and it produced antibodies.
[02:00:32.581 --> 02:00:36.923]  It produced immunity, apparently, and it didn't seem to produce any adverse reactions.
[02:00:36.983 --> 02:00:48.127]  So people were happy with this until, until this, these children were exposed to the natural dengue fever virus itself.
[02:00:48.187 --> 02:00:51.168]  And when that happened, it was catastrophe.
[02:00:51.812 --> 02:01:00.058]  Many died, many were injured, and they, the rest of those children who were exposed to that vaccine, live with that risk for the rest of their lives.
[02:01:00.198 --> 02:01:06.923]  When they will encounter the natural virus, they will overreact and have a meltdown.
[02:01:06.943 --> 02:01:10.826]  Their immune system will go into what is called a cytokine storm.
[02:01:13.072 --> 02:01:20.734]  This process, this immune priming, so that when you encounter the new, the natural virus, you run into real problems.
[02:01:20.754 --> 02:01:23.695]  This was seen with the SARS vaccine in the ferrets.
[02:01:23.735 --> 02:01:34.498]  This was the reason why that experiment, that vaccine was abandoned for SARS, because they saw this overreaction of the immune, the primed immune system.
[02:01:35.549 --> 02:01:44.951]  This is something that we have to be very careful of, and it's not something that's ever going to be seen in the short-term safety studies that are being conducted on these vaccines.
[02:01:44.991 --> 02:01:47.571]  I was about to say, they're skipping animal trials.
[02:01:47.991 --> 02:01:53.153]  They're admitting most people get sick in the trials, and Gates says 700,000 will get sick and die.
[02:01:53.233 --> 02:01:54.753]  What are they priming us for?
[02:01:55.573 --> 02:02:00.114]  A, and then B, getting back to what you were just saying, a lot of experts are saying it looks like
[02:02:00.754 --> 02:02:14.877]  That maybe previous vaccines for the flu, because COVID-19 was some vaccine test, they're not sure, that maybe because it's an artificial test, that once it got out of the lab by accident, it's triggering because it's got flu and SARS and all of it in it.
[02:02:16.178 --> 02:02:26.720]  Yes, and what's alarming about Gates' approach is he goes on television and says everybody should have this vaccine, all 7 billion people in the world, and there will be casualties, there will be risk.
[02:02:27.512 --> 02:02:34.077]  And at that point, Alex, rather than saying, and for those who are injured by the vaccine, there will be compensation.
[02:02:34.497 --> 02:02:35.498]  We will look after them.
[02:02:35.818 --> 02:02:37.239]  We will make sure that their health.
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:39.121]  He says we need to be indemnified.
[02:02:39.901 --> 02:02:40.902]  That's exactly right.
[02:02:41.002 --> 02:02:47.787]  His emphasis, his only concern is there will be injuries and therefore we need indemnity for the manufacturers.
[02:02:48.108 --> 02:02:49.709]  There's no shred of humanity.
[02:02:50.678 --> 02:02:58.588]  In his reaction to the fact that... Well, the good news is, thanks to you and millions of people... You're one of the top... You'll want credit, but it's gotta be due where it's due.
[02:02:58.828 --> 02:03:00.070]  We'll know to protect you and support you.
[02:03:00.530 --> 02:03:02.012]  Thanks to you and others in this show.
[02:03:03.634 --> 02:03:05.176]  They have to admit now there's damage.
[02:03:05.196 --> 02:03:06.678]  Remember, they used to say you were crazy.
[02:03:06.718 --> 02:03:07.940]  There's no damage, Dr. Wakefield.
[02:03:09.585 --> 02:03:10.045]  That's right.
[02:03:10.185 --> 02:03:12.626]  And now it's become so self-evident.
[02:03:12.666 --> 02:03:13.687]  This is the tragedy, Alex.
[02:03:13.707 --> 02:03:15.727]  It's become so common, so prevalent.
[02:03:16.288 --> 02:03:22.630]  Even those who had resisted this notion for many years are witnessing it in their own communities, their own families, their own children.
[02:03:23.630 --> 02:03:24.911]  It's really very, very sad.
[02:03:24.971 --> 02:03:26.592]  It should never have had to be this way.
[02:03:26.612 --> 02:03:29.493]  And there is so much damage that could have been avoided.
[02:03:29.653 --> 02:03:31.553]  And the question now is, what do we do?
[02:03:31.613 --> 02:03:32.834]  What do Americans do?
[02:03:33.737 --> 02:03:57.553]  And the fascinating thing about this is someone who observes American politics, having come from the outside and observes American politics, is that the rush to mandate vaccines for all children, ultimately all adults, in states, which is where these laws are made, has been divided directly down political lines.
[02:03:57.874 --> 02:04:02.437]  And in every effort to support mandatory vaccination, there are the Democrats.
[02:04:03.152 --> 02:04:07.639]  And in the resistance to mandatory vaccination, there have been the Republicans.
[02:04:07.719 --> 02:04:09.081]  And that's just a fact.
[02:04:10.163 --> 02:04:11.945]  I don't mean to quantify it or qualify it.
[02:04:11.965 --> 02:04:14.829]  I agree, but that's getting a lot of liberals to support the Republicans.
[02:04:15.671 --> 02:04:16.712]  It's a simple fact.
[02:04:16.852 --> 02:04:18.395]  And so, but what is happening now?
[02:04:19.278 --> 02:04:30.689]  is that many, many more people are coming over to this side, to the side of health freedom, of bodily autonomy, of the choice to what to put in your child's body or your own body.
[02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:43.060]  People have been woken up by this, this COVID issue, such that, and historically, of course, when you look at the way in which the political parties are funded,
[02:04:43.900 --> 02:05:04.177]  The Republicans get their funding from oil and gas and the automotive industry which are not available to the great majority of Democrats who get their funding largely from the pharmaceutical industry and therefore are beholden to the benevolence of the pharmaceutical industry to mount their campaigns and therefore when it comes to instituting
[02:05:04.915 --> 02:05:10.939]  Preferential policies for that industry, it's seen state by state by state.
[02:05:11.019 --> 02:05:12.760]  Why don't we just nationalize vaccines?
[02:05:12.780 --> 02:05:19.765]  Because, I mean, let me ask you as an expert, if there's a vaccine works, like tetanus or whatever, if it's not tainted or been tested, I want it.
[02:05:20.125 --> 02:05:23.147]  I mean, I get it has side effects, but are you against vaccines, period?
[02:05:23.427 --> 02:05:25.108]  I mean, we're not against vaccines, right?
[02:05:25.288 --> 02:05:27.730]  We're just against liability protection and guinea pigging, right?
[02:05:29.068 --> 02:05:30.770]  I'm not against anything, Alex.
[02:05:31.090 --> 02:05:33.353]  I'm pro-science, I'm pro-safety, I'm pro-law.
[02:05:33.393 --> 02:05:34.835]  So are there any safe vaccines?
[02:05:34.855 --> 02:05:36.516]  Has everyone I've ever looked at got problems?
[02:05:37.598 --> 02:05:38.338]  Yeah.
[02:05:38.579 --> 02:05:40.221]  That's my experience as well.
[02:05:40.281 --> 02:05:42.303]  The more I look, the more problems I find.
[02:05:42.953 --> 02:05:43.533]  I don't think so.
[02:06:03.168 --> 02:06:04.470]  We only got a minute and a half left.
[02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:05.411]  I want people to go see the film.
[02:06:05.431 --> 02:06:06.992]  But in closing, gut level.
[02:06:07.052 --> 02:06:07.713]  How does this end?
[02:06:07.833 --> 02:06:09.535]  I see the big establishment losing.
[02:06:09.856 --> 02:06:12.859]  I think like Hitler, when he's losing in the West, he invades Russia.
[02:06:12.899 --> 02:06:13.900]  That makes him totally lose.
[02:06:14.261 --> 02:06:18.345]  I think this offense they've launched, to use the Hitler analogies, they're Barbarossa.
[02:06:18.766 --> 02:06:19.447]  They're Waterloo.
[02:06:19.467 --> 02:06:20.227]  I think they're going to lose.
[02:06:21.175 --> 02:06:21.756]  I think they are.
[02:06:21.816 --> 02:06:38.035]  And I think what the American people, and I have very good reason to believe this, the American people will ultimately in November vote for a president, whoever that might be, who will stand up and say American bodily autonomy, the right of Americans to choose what goes into their bodies, is first and foremost.
[02:06:38.095 --> 02:06:39.277]  That is what America's about.
[02:06:39.875 --> 02:06:45.699]  If we are going to rush this vaccine to market, if there is no liability, there can be no mandates.
[02:06:45.739 --> 02:06:49.061]  You cannot force people to have something that's not been... not at all!
[02:06:49.261 --> 02:06:53.404]  And Trump has said he doesn't want mandates, but he still says, oh, vaccine to get the stock market up.
[02:06:54.204 --> 02:06:54.945]  Absolutely incredible.
[02:06:54.985 --> 02:06:56.086]  So the film is out now.
[02:06:56.606 --> 02:07:00.008]  If I go home tonight, I've got to watch the one censored on pedophilia.
[02:07:00.028 --> 02:07:00.809]  I'm going to get to that.
[02:07:00.829 --> 02:07:02.069]  But I'm going to watch your film this weekend.
[02:07:02.690 --> 02:07:04.131]  If I go to the site, I can watch it tonight.
[02:07:05.097 --> 02:07:08.938]  You can watch it tonight, you can download it, and you can order your DVD.
[02:07:08.978 --> 02:07:10.978]  You go there, Alex, and I'd love to hear what you think of it.
[02:07:11.618 --> 02:07:12.419]  Oh, I'm going to watch it.
[02:07:12.439 --> 02:07:13.919]  I love your work, and it's so important.
[02:07:13.939 --> 02:07:16.099]  I'm going to share it and tell friends and family.
[02:07:16.479 --> 02:07:18.120]  Again, what's the best website for people to visit?
[02:07:19.260 --> 02:07:22.421]  Go to 1986theact.com.
[02:07:22.821 --> 02:07:25.201]  www.1986theact.com.
[02:07:25.401 --> 02:07:27.462]  And then, folks, once you see it, have a viewing party.
[02:07:27.862 --> 02:07:29.122]  All right, Dr. Wakefield, thank you.
[02:07:29.382 --> 02:07:31.483]  Let's get you back again in the next few weeks or the next month.
[02:07:31.743 --> 02:07:32.663]  We really appreciate you, sir.
[02:07:33.652 --> 02:07:34.353]  Alex, great to be on.
[02:07:34.373 --> 02:07:34.633]  Thank you.
[02:07:34.933 --> 02:07:35.794]  Wow, what a gentleman.
[02:07:36.274 --> 02:07:37.795]  And the example of what to be.
[02:07:37.896 --> 02:07:38.676]  I mean, the maverick.
[02:07:38.696 --> 02:07:39.697]  People say, I've gone through hell.
[02:07:40.117 --> 02:07:41.458]  Hell, I had the audience to support me.
[02:07:41.478 --> 02:07:43.600]  That guy lost his job, got run out, everything.
[02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:45.061]  But it all came back to him, like Job.
[02:07:45.562 --> 02:07:47.824]  I mean, if you want to hear a modern example of Job, it's Dr. Wakefield.
[02:07:48.084 --> 02:07:50.686]  We'll be back with a fourth hour, a few segments, then our special guest.
[02:07:52.107 --> 02:07:54.789]  You know, I take no pleasure coming out against LeBron James.
[02:07:55.730 --> 02:07:57.712]  If he stood up for humanity, he'd be so powerful.
[02:07:59.804 --> 02:08:03.186]  But he supports Nike and Apple and all of their slave camps in China.
[02:08:03.226 --> 02:08:04.006]  He's a slave master.
[02:08:04.547 --> 02:08:08.389]  This headline's America Burns LeBron James Jersey After He Comes Out As A Communist.
[02:08:09.229 --> 02:08:10.150]  No, he's worse than that.
[02:08:10.210 --> 02:08:14.752]  He's a man that turned his back on free humans and then said America sucked.
[02:08:14.772 --> 02:08:15.353]  Here's the report.
[02:08:15.373 --> 02:08:16.713]  It's on Infowars.com.
[02:08:17.474 --> 02:08:19.115]  Owen Schroer and Rob and others.
[02:08:19.135 --> 02:08:19.455]  Here it is.
[02:08:20.691 --> 02:08:24.694]  You know, I used to be a fan of LeBron James.
[02:08:25.335 --> 02:08:26.696]  I grew up playing basketball.
[02:08:26.876 --> 02:08:28.177]  Always was a basketball fan.
[02:08:28.678 --> 02:08:30.559]  Loved watching the NBA on TV.
[02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:42.089]  And sadly, what I've seen professional sports, and more than any of them, the NBA become, is a Marxist, Chinese, anti-American propaganda tool.
[02:08:42.869 --> 02:08:47.393]  And the leader of this in the NBA is LeBron James.
[02:08:48.034 --> 02:08:49.755]  LeBron, I used to be a big fan of yours, man.
[02:08:50.296 --> 02:08:52.077]  I liked watching you play basketball.
[02:08:52.678 --> 02:08:54.239]  I liked watching you win championships.
[02:08:54.379 --> 02:08:57.082]  I appreciated your greatness on the court.
[02:08:57.142 --> 02:08:59.524]  You truly are a great basketball player.
[02:08:59.544 --> 02:09:05.068]  But when it comes to a man, when it comes to an American, you're pathetic.
[02:09:06.289 --> 02:09:07.490]  And now that I know
[02:09:08.615 --> 02:09:11.756]  That LeBron James is a slave owner?
[02:09:12.157 --> 02:09:12.437]  Yeah!
[02:09:13.297 --> 02:09:15.578]  Where do you think LeBron James shoes get made?
[02:09:15.638 --> 02:09:17.819]  Where do you think LeBron James jerseys get made?
[02:09:18.099 --> 02:09:21.080]  And his shirts and all the LeBron memorabilia?
[02:09:21.701 --> 02:09:22.161]  China!
[02:09:23.100 --> 02:09:25.661]  With child labor and slave labor.
[02:09:25.741 --> 02:09:28.703]  Now, LeBron James is worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:09:28.903 --> 02:09:30.684]  Nike is a billion-dollar company.
[02:09:31.284 --> 02:09:37.807]  They could easily afford to pay Americans that LeBron James claims to care so much about with Black Lives Matter.
[02:09:38.227 --> 02:09:43.369]  They could afford to pay American kids, even, that want to get their first job.
[02:09:43.389 --> 02:09:44.830]  $15, even $20 an hour.
[02:09:45.090 --> 02:09:46.131]  Pretty good starting wage.
[02:09:47.131 --> 02:09:53.634]  And those American kids could earn that wage in American factories that make American shoes made in America.
[02:09:54.174 --> 02:09:55.475]  But LeBron James doesn't do that.
[02:09:55.535 --> 02:09:56.275]  Nike doesn't do that.
[02:09:56.335 --> 02:09:56.555]  No.
[02:09:57.315 --> 02:10:07.920]  Instead, he puts on the Black Lives Matter shirt, which we now know is just a Marxist, Communist, anti-family agenda.
[02:10:09.448 --> 02:10:11.269]  You can go look at it for yourself, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:11.649 --> 02:10:14.851]  Black Lives Matter stands for ending the nuclear family.
[02:10:15.451 --> 02:10:28.437]  And just like LeBron is a pathetic American for selling out to China, he's a pathetic father for selling out his own family and his own boys for the Black Lives Matter agenda.
[02:10:28.457 --> 02:10:31.099]  So I'm upset that I have to do this today.
[02:10:32.399 --> 02:10:33.320]  But we're gonna go ahead
[02:10:34.673 --> 02:10:43.286]  And we're gonna light this traitor's, this communist traitor's, this anti-American traitor's jersey on fire here today.
[02:10:43.307 --> 02:10:47.794]  Because this is how America feels about the NBA right now.
[02:10:49.278 --> 02:10:53.741]  This is how America feels about the NBA catering and pandering to the Chinese communists.
[02:10:54.562 --> 02:11:14.575]  This is how America feels about athletes that make more money and are worth more money than the average American could ever even imagine taking a knee and telling us how we're privileged, taking a knee telling us how we need to give up our rights, taking a knee telling us how they're oppressed.
[02:11:15.748 --> 02:11:21.191]  So this is what America thinks now about LeBron James and the NBA.
[02:11:21.271 --> 02:11:22.932]  And by the way, it's mutual.
[02:11:23.813 --> 02:11:28.035]  Because LeBron James came out and said, we don't care if America watches our games or not.
[02:11:28.475 --> 02:11:29.796]  Why would he say something like that?
[02:11:30.396 --> 02:11:34.619]  Because he knows, ladies and gentlemen, they already sold out to the Chinese.
[02:11:35.019 --> 02:11:37.020]  They're already making their Chinese money.
[02:11:37.861 --> 02:11:42.964]  So if LeBron James ever wants to be taken seriously as a man, and as an American again,
[02:11:44.352 --> 02:11:47.314]  He needs to stop pandering for the CHICOMS.
[02:11:47.995 --> 02:11:51.637]  He needs to stop attacking the American family.
[02:11:52.318 --> 02:12:00.303]  And he needs to stop attacking the values and principles that we stand for during the National Anthem in this country.
[02:12:00.443 --> 02:12:01.224]  But just know this.
[02:12:02.245 --> 02:12:04.326]  LeBron James is not a basketball player.
[02:12:05.047 --> 02:12:05.307]  No.
[02:12:06.047 --> 02:12:09.110]  LeBron James is now a slave owner
[02:12:10.114 --> 02:12:20.677]  That makes all of his jerseys and shoes, and he's also now a leader of a domestic, anti-family, anti-American terror group known as Black Lives Matter.
[02:12:21.517 --> 02:12:22.717]  That's what LeBron James is.
[02:12:25.638 --> 02:12:27.318]  LeBron's a slave of the new world order.
[02:12:28.639 --> 02:12:29.319]  That's all he knows.
[02:12:31.199 --> 02:12:34.120]  Now, we're gonna start the next hour.
[02:12:34.140 --> 02:12:37.701]  I have a special report that Dr. Nick Begich has taken over.
[02:12:39.451 --> 02:12:41.292]  But don't get upset by people that are followers.
[02:12:41.552 --> 02:12:42.933]  LeBron James is just a follower.
[02:12:43.593 --> 02:12:47.195]  Well, Twitter now bans tweets from the President, medical doctors, and his son.
[02:12:47.215 --> 02:12:49.556]  There's an article on InfoWars.com.
[02:12:49.576 --> 02:12:50.696]  Twitter bans all links.
[02:12:52.117 --> 02:12:55.879]  The video sharing site, BitChute, gets 30 million views a month.
[02:12:56.499 --> 02:12:58.320]  Well, guess who gets more than 30 million views a month?
[02:12:58.380 --> 02:13:00.221]  And I wish BitChute got a thousand times that.
[02:13:00.941 --> 02:13:01.722]  InfoWars.
[02:13:02.082 --> 02:13:03.022]  Fan.video.
[02:13:03.483 --> 02:13:04.823]  And we're there and we're fighting hard.
[02:13:05.403 --> 02:13:06.144]  We're pro-America.
[02:13:07.503 --> 02:13:08.866]  We're not backing down, so remember that.
[02:13:09.308 --> 02:13:11.312]  All videos that are banned are at Banned.Video.
[02:13:11.814 --> 02:13:14.099]  Here's a special report that Dr. Nick Begich has taken over.
[02:13:15.390 --> 02:13:19.854]  They were the ones that lied from A to Z about everything about coronavirus.
[02:13:20.254 --> 02:13:21.395]  They lied about the death toll.
[02:13:21.415 --> 02:13:22.856]  They lied about how they were doing the testing.
[02:13:23.297 --> 02:13:25.839]  They lied and counted people that died of gunshot wounds and car wrecks.
[02:13:26.839 --> 02:13:39.210]  And these same frauds that then own the patents on the very vaccines they're trying to force us to take with incredible conflicts of interest come out now and tell us that the whole world is collapsing in a planetary reset.
[02:13:40.051 --> 02:13:46.874]  Not because they created all this fiat currency, not because they stole trillions of dollars, not because they created this huge bubble, but because of coronavirus.
[02:13:47.375 --> 02:13:56.879]  And I said six months ago, and so did our reporter Greg Reese, we'll play his report in a moment, that this was part of the great global reset that Deimos and others have been calling for.
[02:13:57.219 --> 02:14:03.802]  That way the establishment doesn't get the blame for the collapse of civilization that they've engineered, that they'll use to consolidate power.
[02:14:04.363 --> 02:14:04.463]  No.
[02:14:05.243 --> 02:14:07.445]  That way they blame it on COVID-19.
[02:14:07.685 --> 02:14:10.526]  And that's exactly what the Rockefeller Foundation talked about a decade ago.
[02:14:10.546 --> 02:14:12.728]  It's what Bill and Melinda Gates talked about last year.
[02:14:13.368 --> 02:14:20.153]  Using a global pandemic or the fear of a pandemic to bring in absolute and total control.
[02:14:21.033 --> 02:14:26.854]  With a police state and a surveillance tech grid with the contact tracers over the organized collapse.
[02:14:27.254 --> 02:14:32.455]  And so the people would accept having a permanent loss in their standard of living to lower their carbon.
[02:14:32.956 --> 02:14:34.396]  Well now they've come out and admitted that.
[02:14:34.876 --> 02:14:39.337]  Michelle Obama has said COVID is going to help us re-engineer the world and redistribute wealth.
[02:14:39.637 --> 02:14:42.738]  And CNN and the New York Times have said this is good for the earth.
[02:14:42.938 --> 02:14:44.238]  It's lowering our carbon footprint.
[02:14:44.718 --> 02:14:58.981]  But the richest people in the world are leftist and communist and socialist who fly around in jumbo jets and make billions of dollars a year because communism is set up by the elites to enslave and domesticate those at the bottom every single time.
[02:14:59.321 --> 02:15:02.322]  It's a way to con people back into serfdom and back into slavery.
[02:15:02.882 --> 02:15:09.164]  So the worldwide collapse that we are accelerating into right now has been a hundred percent engineered
[02:15:10.026 --> 02:15:17.348]  And authored and implemented by the globalists to bring in world government, to put the United Nations, WHO in charge.
[02:15:17.968 --> 02:15:26.410]  And now we see videos all over Europe and all over the US and the UK, Australia, where there'll be a woman not wearing a mask in a store and people walk up and say, you can't be here without a mask.
[02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:32.271]  The WHO says, and the woman's like, but local law says, if I have asthma or something, I'll have to wear it.
[02:15:32.291 --> 02:15:33.091]  He says, I don't care.
[02:15:33.151 --> 02:15:35.031]  The UN says, get out of here.
[02:15:35.732 --> 02:15:37.012]  So you wake up and you're under.
[02:15:38.325 --> 02:15:39.065]  The United Nations.
[02:15:39.125 --> 02:15:40.726]  And it brings in the cashless society.
[02:15:40.746 --> 02:15:41.987]  They're refusing cash everywhere.
[02:15:42.007 --> 02:15:56.554]  And it allows them to surveil us and track us and control us with the Clinton Global Initiative running the worldwide tracking program that then taxpayer money by the billions is then forked over to them to make money while they track and trace and control our lives.
[02:15:57.970 --> 02:16:02.273]  Big Tech was always set up to destroy the freedom of the web and to consolidate power and to censor.
[02:16:02.773 --> 02:16:15.361]  And now that they've silenced almost everyone off the internet, they're moving forward now to silence hundreds of prominent doctors, virologists, epidemiologists, and other scientists that are exposing that the entire COVID-19 story is a lie.
[02:16:16.141 --> 02:16:20.225]  And now they're talking about arresting people that question Fauci and the United Nations.
[02:16:20.685 --> 02:16:24.649]  We've gone off the edge of the cliff into high-tech modern tyranny.
[02:16:25.149 --> 02:16:27.111]  And only being honest about it is going to stop it.
[02:16:27.772 --> 02:16:33.677]  Now the United States is seeing food prices massively spike because if there's a positive at a farm,
[02:16:34.057 --> 02:16:34.737]  Of COVID-19.
[02:16:34.757 --> 02:16:35.818]  They shut it down for a few weeks.
[02:16:35.978 --> 02:16:38.619]  If there's a positive in a warehouse, they shut it down for a few weeks.
[02:16:38.959 --> 02:16:41.800]  Even if people are asymptomatic in almost every case and not sick.
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:44.200]  China's been open for business the entire time.
[02:16:44.661 --> 02:16:46.521]  Only the United States is still locked down.
[02:16:46.901 --> 02:16:51.263]  Only the United States is told we're the bad guys because we've done a hundred times the testing of anybody else.
[02:16:51.843 --> 02:16:54.345]  And the tests, again, are almost all false positive.
[02:16:54.585 --> 02:16:55.506]  They were designed to be.
[02:16:55.846 --> 02:17:04.494]  This was cooked up in modern globalist warfare circles to bring down the nation-state and bring down America and punish us for electing President Trump.
[02:17:04.934 --> 02:17:11.360]  And President Trump has dropped the ball, stopping the coordinated racketeering of big tech and the silencing of the medical community in America.
[02:17:11.860 --> 02:17:14.843]  We are under an existential threat to destroy our very existence.
[02:17:14.963 --> 02:17:19.086]  There's a letter that General Flynn put out yesterday that lays this out where he explains this is a spiritual war
[02:17:32.498 --> 02:17:32.738]  I think?
[02:17:51.061 --> 02:17:54.142]  The United States is sliding rapidly into Venezuela.
[02:17:54.702 --> 02:17:57.423]  Venezuela has more wealth per capita than the United States.
[02:17:57.944 --> 02:18:11.489]  Raw oil and timber and gold and jewels and infrastructure and they were the richest country in South America until communism came to them and now they have already long since eaten their dogs and cats.
[02:18:11.649 --> 02:18:14.410]  Thousands die a week from starvation and that's where
[02:18:15.350 --> 02:18:18.471]  The United States is going because the globalists want to collapse us.
[02:18:18.551 --> 02:18:19.591]  They want to break us.
[02:18:19.632 --> 02:18:31.756]  And they're starting with the blue cities and blue states, creating artificial depressions, putting out the fentanyl, advertising that you can be homeless and live on the street to destroy confidence and to collapse the entire United States.
[02:18:31.876 --> 02:18:33.576]  That's why they're wrecking things by design.
[02:18:33.796 --> 02:18:35.297]  That's why they're saying overthrow the police.
[02:18:35.517 --> 02:18:39.478]  That's why they're saying blow up the police stations officially in the city of Austin budget.
[02:18:39.898 --> 02:18:41.979]  Because they are overthrowing America.
[02:18:42.219 --> 02:18:43.800]  They are engaged in a takeover.
[02:18:44.614 --> 02:18:50.155]  In closing, I'll tell listeners this, and viewers, this is the most critical time in human history, not just U.S.
[02:18:50.195 --> 02:18:50.476]  history.
[02:18:50.836 --> 02:19:03.439]  Eighty days out from the election, you need to share the articles and the videos from Man.Video and NewsWorks.com and InfoWars.com like your very life depends on it because it does, ladies and gentlemen, it does.
[02:19:05.046 --> 02:19:16.912]  And it is so important now when people are so hungry, when everybody else is being silenced, to know that hundreds of doctors and others that have been silenced are all in the banned video section of Banned.Video where you can see them.
[02:19:17.012 --> 02:19:20.114]  And many of them have millions of views, but they need to have tens of millions of views.
[02:19:20.674 --> 02:19:24.136]  And also you need to support InfoWars so we can pay for the bandwidth.
[02:19:24.216 --> 02:19:33.961]  Buy a t-shirt, buy a book, buy a film, buy a privacy pocket at InfoWarsTore.com and help yourself and help us because it takes money to fight this war.
[02:19:34.321 --> 02:19:45.527]  But whatever you do, pray for us and keep spreading the word and sharing the links, because we are really hurting the globalists, and we're about 50-50 right now, at the brink, sudden death over time, in the Super Bowl for humanity's future.
[02:19:45.968 --> 02:19:55.493]  And again, we have storable food right now, with 3-4 week delivery, highest quality, in stock, the best packaging, last 25 years, at mfulmorestore.com, powered by my Patreon.
[02:19:55.973 --> 02:20:00.195]  And I'm telling you, the way the world's going, whether Trump gets elected or not, things are just going to get crazier.
[02:20:00.315 --> 02:20:07.098]  You need to have storable food for the future so that you're not dependent on the system when things collapse and when inflation comes in because of what's unfolding.
[02:20:07.258 --> 02:20:11.640]  And if there's a successful plunge in the dollar, this country's going to look like Venezuela in six months.
[02:20:12.080 --> 02:20:14.041]  It won't take five years like Venezuela to get to that point.
[02:20:14.381 --> 02:20:19.243]  So I would suggest everyone go to infowarstore.com and get a three month, a six month, a year supply.
[02:20:19.924 --> 02:20:26.775]  And hide that food and know it's got the best packaging and the highest quality and it lasts 25 years because you need firearms.
[02:20:26.795 --> 02:20:27.676]  You need to know how to use them.
[02:20:27.696 --> 02:20:29.279]  You need water filtration, air filtration.
[02:20:29.539 --> 02:20:30.360]  You need storable food.
[02:20:31.102 --> 02:20:33.145]  We have everything with the firearms at FullWorksStore.com.
[02:20:33.968 --> 02:20:35.249]  We have other survival accessories.
[02:20:35.469 --> 02:20:42.193]  All I'm just saying is get ready and get serious, and talk to your neighborhood, talk to your neighbors, talk to your family, and have an emergency plan.
[02:20:42.734 --> 02:20:45.976]  None of us have a perfect emergency plan, but we've got to start looking at that.
[02:20:46.356 --> 02:20:52.360]  I've been so focused on fighting the globalists offensively, I've never even gotten ready for my own personal self, on my own advice.
[02:20:52.721 --> 02:20:59.125]  Things have gotten so serious, I bought a little piece of land, about 30 miles, 35 miles outside Austin, and I'm putting in the well.
[02:20:59.625 --> 02:21:07.836]  And I'll put in the trailer, and I'm getting it ready in case things totally collapse, ladies and gentlemen, so I can basically evacuate if the power goes off.
[02:21:07.916 --> 02:21:14.585]  I mean, the New World Order, just like Larry Grafwold exposed, really plans to implode everything and end this country forever.
[02:21:15.106 --> 02:21:29.232]  Okay, they really plan to collapse things, turn off the food, turn off the water, and make you come and sue for peace, and get on your knees and turn in your guns, and take your implantable chip that Gates is proposing, and take your forced inoculation, and carry your little Obama phone, your 2.0, that tracks what you do.
[02:21:29.592 --> 02:21:30.252]  I mean, it's here.
[02:21:30.312 --> 02:21:31.273]  This is the dystopia.
[02:21:31.473 --> 02:21:33.013]  They've been preparing for it for decades.
[02:21:33.073 --> 02:21:34.794]  It's now collapsing into us.
[02:21:34.874 --> 02:21:35.374]  This is it.
[02:21:36.355 --> 02:21:39.176]  So get ready, and get prepared, and just remember that
[02:21:40.339 --> 02:21:44.064]  People are already having to sell their children to slavery all over the world just to be able to feed their other children.
[02:21:44.205 --> 02:21:46.408]  Okay, you have to decide what child to sell into sex slavery.
[02:21:46.428 --> 02:21:46.968]  That's in the news.
[02:21:48.314 --> 02:21:52.095]  It will become like that overnight here as well, and it's so sad, it's so disgusting.
[02:21:52.495 --> 02:21:55.516]  And again, I'm just begging people to realize we're not in Kansas anymore.
[02:21:55.756 --> 02:21:57.137]  We're not in a normal situation anymore.
[02:21:57.377 --> 02:22:00.578]  We're fighting existentially for our very existence.
[02:22:00.638 --> 02:22:02.558]  That's why they're causing race war to divide everybody.
[02:22:02.578 --> 02:22:04.139]  That's why they're causing economic war.
[02:22:04.399 --> 02:22:07.900]  It's why they're causing this total lockdown, because we are under a new old order attack.
[02:22:08.580 --> 02:22:14.602]  And if American people aren't strong enough to admit that to themselves, Trump won't be strong enough to tell us the truth and really do what needs to be done.
[02:22:15.382 --> 02:22:15.982]  But this is it.
[02:22:16.503 --> 02:22:17.443]  Pray to God for guidance.
[02:22:18.023 --> 02:22:18.763]  God bless and good luck.
[02:22:37.601 --> 02:22:38.661]  And welcome back.
[02:22:38.762 --> 02:22:45.804]  This is Nick Begich from Anchorage, Alaska, and I'm coming to you in my morning or afternoon in most of the world.
[02:22:45.924 --> 02:23:04.091]  And boy, you know, listening to that last segment, you know, just talking about sort of what's happening and where we're headed, how we're kind of being herded and pushed along in a certain direction over the cliff actually isn't a bad analogy.
[02:23:04.947 --> 02:23:10.531]  What I want to talk about today is the issues of personal privacy, which keep coming up.
[02:23:10.631 --> 02:23:15.995]  I mean, in the context of medical records and vaccines, this stuff that's being discussed.
[02:23:17.256 --> 02:23:21.519]  Wakefield, who we just heard from, you know, is one of the most outspoken folks.
[02:23:22.788 --> 02:23:26.909]  On the issue, excellent guest on vaccines.
[02:23:27.549 --> 02:23:50.076]  The thing that strikes me is the opportunity and what Alex was alluding to, the whole collapse of our entire system and the reset and being blamed on COVID-19, when in fact, anyone who was tracking anything about what was going on in the financial markets knew that we were headed for some really unsettling times.
[02:23:50.476 --> 02:23:52.397]  But think about what's actually happened.
[02:23:52.967 --> 02:23:55.728]  Is there is a tidal wave that's kind of been suspended.
[02:23:56.388 --> 02:24:04.351]  It's there, it's not being felt by everyone yet, but it's there about ready to just make that final last fall on top of everyone.
[02:24:05.172 --> 02:24:22.038]  And what I say about this is it's all been artificially propped up and it's given coverage to a lot of big financial people by pumping so much money into the stock market, so much money into the financial markets, blowing up a really a
[02:24:22.978 --> 02:24:23.399]  All right.
[02:24:41.765 --> 02:24:42.466]  I think so.
[02:24:59.259 --> 02:25:01.581]  The average person is feeling it.
[02:25:01.601 --> 02:25:05.344]  They're feeling it in inflation, starting in the supermarket, primarily with food.
[02:25:05.945 --> 02:25:08.487]  They're seeing it in no jobs.
[02:25:08.647 --> 02:25:09.588]  I mean, come on.
[02:25:09.608 --> 02:25:11.609]  The service sector is not back.
[02:25:11.689 --> 02:25:13.751]  It's not coming back in the same form.
[02:25:14.512 --> 02:25:21.157]  The prop up to the economy in terms of unemployment and these things are in debate.
[02:25:21.717 --> 02:25:23.979]  I'm sure that will get resolved in the next few days.
[02:25:24.199 --> 02:25:28.683]  And just given where everyone's at, if the Democrats can figure out a way to blame Trump,
[02:25:29.246 --> 02:25:31.007]  They probably won't put any more money in it.
[02:25:31.628 --> 02:25:36.392]  If they can't, they'll fully fund it through the election period.
[02:25:36.432 --> 02:25:47.221]  And here's the thing that's so disturbing, is the COVID-19 issue, all of this is being framed politically when it really ought to be framed in science.
[02:25:49.017 --> 02:25:54.502]  And if you look at all of the news coverage, it's all about, when do we get the orange man next?
[02:25:54.762 --> 02:25:56.203]  When do we beat up Trump next?
[02:25:56.283 --> 02:25:57.284]  And that's what we're seeing.
[02:25:57.824 --> 02:26:04.290]  And that what's occurred because of that is real information that all of us need is not coming through.
[02:26:04.690 --> 02:26:16.580]  And it's just another layering of this matrix of control of public airwaves, private communications, and really getting back into the privacy it gives cover.
[02:26:17.706 --> 02:26:24.673]  To blame a virus for incompetence, both governmentally and in terms of corporate America.
[02:26:25.237 --> 02:26:30.518]  And the world, globalists for that matter, who have set us up for this grand collapse.
[02:26:30.578 --> 02:26:32.719]  And then you look at what is the aftermath?
[02:26:32.759 --> 02:26:34.079]  What have you seen in the background?
[02:26:34.560 --> 02:26:36.020]  And we've all been talking about it.
[02:26:36.760 --> 02:26:49.443]  The World Health Organization, the UN, even the Democrats in Congress talked about rolling out the ultimate ID chips, you know, a way to secure positive identification.
[02:26:50.424 --> 02:26:50.664]  This
[02:26:52.091 --> 02:26:58.918]  Really would round out what's been happening for the last three decades in terms of data collection and manipulation.
[02:26:58.979 --> 02:27:08.569]  This would essentially allow government and private entities to have every bit of data necessary to profile you per
[02:27:09.392 --> 02:27:18.055]  All of your consumption habits, all of your communication habits, the post office and government track every piece of mail, who it's from and where it goes.
[02:27:18.555 --> 02:27:21.035]  You know, when it's scanned in, all that data is kept.
[02:27:21.416 --> 02:27:22.896]  All your phone records are kept.
[02:27:22.956 --> 02:27:24.456]  All your medical records are kept.
[02:27:24.496 --> 02:27:34.879]  You realize that just going on the Internet and on your phone because of the apps and the permissions you've given, every single thing is important, is kept.
[02:27:35.380 --> 02:27:36.680]  Where you put your cursor,
[02:27:37.170 --> 02:27:39.932]  You know, when you move around the screen, you kind of let it rest.
[02:27:40.352 --> 02:27:42.294]  Most people let it rest in the same place.
[02:27:42.314 --> 02:27:45.656]  They keep track of that, because that's where the pop-ups occurred.
[02:27:45.696 --> 02:27:49.279]  If you've noticed the aggravation, that's where they occur, right?
[02:27:49.659 --> 02:27:50.920]  Or in your field of vision.
[02:27:51.561 --> 02:27:58.446]  So you have to respond or at least look at them, glance at them, because it's all about getting your attention, holding your attention,
[02:27:59.031 --> 02:28:09.061]  Gathering data and then getting you into a feedback loop that keeps you moving down a certain trajectory that can be moved any way a person wants.
[02:28:09.101 --> 02:28:16.389]  It can move you left, move you right by just limiting or expanding your information flow according to what it is that you're about.
[02:28:17.150 --> 02:28:22.295]  Now everything, you got to think about this again in the context of personal privacy,
[02:28:23.035 --> 02:28:24.395]  Every time you use a credit card.
[02:28:24.756 --> 02:28:25.936]  And now they don't want to take cash.
[02:28:26.416 --> 02:28:27.096]  They want a card.
[02:28:27.516 --> 02:28:30.397]  So all those transactions affect that few individuals.
[02:28:30.957 --> 02:28:32.998]  So you get the bigger and better profile.
[02:28:33.058 --> 02:28:36.179]  Now the problem with all of this is how it's used.
[02:28:37.059 --> 02:28:39.140]  Because it's used to manipulate.
[02:28:40.120 --> 02:28:45.542]  You know, we've all talked about, and you've heard about if you're listening to this broadcast, the China Socialist Party.
[02:28:46.162 --> 02:28:48.563]  We have exactly the same thing.
[02:28:49.332 --> 02:28:58.540]  Social scoring in China is every data element, every facial recognition interaction on the street, where you are, what you do, determines what you can do.
[02:28:58.600 --> 02:29:09.929]  Within a communist state, it regulates what kind of apartment you can get, whether you're going to get a passport and travel out of the country, whether you can ride a train or you got to walk, whether you get a job or whether you don't, whether your kids go to college or whether they don't.
[02:29:10.549 --> 02:29:17.175]  All that is decided by social scoring, gathering all of your data and then determining how it lines up with the state.
[02:29:18.061 --> 02:29:27.703]  And we see the same thing happening in the West under the guise of consumerism, under the guise of the age of surveillance capitalism.
[02:29:28.243 --> 02:29:31.544]  You know, this, even the New York Times was smart enough to see this one.
[02:29:32.124 --> 02:29:38.046]  And this one is one of the best books on what's happening with our data.
[02:29:38.146 --> 02:29:40.827]  And yet it's still only a snapshot.
[02:29:40.847 --> 02:29:41.747]  And this is a thick book.
[02:29:41.827 --> 02:29:44.147]  I mean, it's got hundreds of citations.
[02:29:44.207 --> 02:29:46.808]  I mean, hundreds of source documents, the kind of book that I like.
[02:29:47.461 --> 02:29:54.164]  Because it gives you the evidence that you need so that we can make determinations about what's happening and how our world is shaping.
[02:29:54.945 --> 02:30:11.393]  The whole connection of individual ID tacked to you and then ultimately a type of ID that is biometric perhaps, maybe your fingerprints, maybe your iris scans, maybe your face for facial recognition, all three have been captured in India.
[02:30:11.873 --> 02:30:15.955]  And if you want to get on any system there, any of their governmental systems,
[02:30:16.696 --> 02:30:19.178]  You have to have that biometrics.
[02:30:19.618 --> 02:30:23.041]  This is what's happening on the commercial side and the private side.
[02:30:23.461 --> 02:30:27.664]  It's all being done, of course, for your own safety and security.
[02:30:28.419 --> 02:30:31.842]  That's the story, but that is the biggest lie of all.
[02:30:31.922 --> 02:30:35.345]  Because what we need to do is turn this around the other way.
[02:30:35.405 --> 02:30:37.807]  We need transparency in government.
[02:30:37.887 --> 02:30:40.889]  We need transparency for multinational corporations.
[02:30:40.929 --> 02:30:47.194]  We need transparency for the non-profit organizations that are their left and right arms for manipulating the public.
[02:30:47.575 --> 02:30:49.236]  We need transparency.
[02:30:49.256 --> 02:30:51.578]  The camera's pointing the other direction.
[02:30:52.128 --> 02:30:58.374]  Not at us as individuals, as sovereign souls, but at the other guy who's looking in on our lives.
[02:30:58.694 --> 02:30:59.835]  This is Dr. Nick Feggish.
[02:30:59.855 --> 02:31:02.157]  We're going to be back after these brief messages.
[02:31:02.197 --> 02:31:02.778]  Stay tuned.
[02:31:02.798 --> 02:31:03.739]  This is InfoWar.
[02:31:04.540 --> 02:31:12.261]  And I want to remind folks they can check out a lot of information at InfoWarsCourse.com.
[02:31:12.381 --> 02:31:13.202]  Everything is there.
[02:31:13.262 --> 02:31:17.042]  And my site is linked up in terms of the InfoWars store.
[02:31:17.082 --> 02:31:23.443]  You can check out my books and videos at EarthPulse.com.
[02:31:23.863 --> 02:31:26.704]  That hooks you straight on in and take a look.
[02:31:26.824 --> 02:31:27.984]  Sign up for our newsletter.
[02:31:28.004 --> 02:31:29.104]  We appreciate it when you do.
[02:31:29.824 --> 02:31:32.505]  And currently everything that we market
[02:31:33.205 --> 02:31:35.647]  We mark it through InfoWars Store.
[02:31:36.067 --> 02:31:43.412]  You know, I'm thinking about where we're at on the privacy questions and getting back into that because that really is the crux of it.
[02:31:43.472 --> 02:31:46.094]  And you know, I've written about this stuff for years.
[02:31:46.214 --> 02:31:56.842]  In fact, in Earth Rising the Revolution 20 years ago, we were talking about sort of where we would be today and Alex references this sometimes because
[02:31:57.722 --> 02:32:04.824]  It was so clear to us at EarthPulse those years ago of what was happening and the trajectory we were on.
[02:32:05.305 --> 02:32:12.487]  And in the end, sort of the last piece in the puzzle was to get all transactions, everything you do.
[02:32:13.007 --> 02:32:21.990]  And this is, again, you know, the filthy money we circulate now being told that, hey, this is a virus, Gary, we need to get rid of it.
[02:32:22.814 --> 02:32:23.014]  All right.
[02:32:38.887 --> 02:32:59.758]  Money to use some third-party bank, you know, I mean at least let's use the second party Financial Reserve notes, you know, I mean and they don't but they won't accept them It says good for all that public and private and it's a lie on the back of every Printed piece of currency because a lot of people aren't taking them now and I don't think that's Meet the letter of the law.
[02:32:59.858 --> 02:33:02.499]  Is that an interference with my right to trade in commerce?
[02:33:02.519 --> 02:33:02.539]  I
[02:33:03.199 --> 02:33:05.480]  I think it is, to limit currency.
[02:33:05.840 --> 02:33:16.582]  And it's clear in the Constitution who prints currency and that there is a printing involved, you know, and we could allege or they could assert that maybe electronic is the way of the future, but it's not.
[02:33:17.082 --> 02:33:27.485]  It's the way of invasiveness, you see, because it's your digital doorway that once again is being kicked in by globalists under this guise of protection.
[02:33:28.496 --> 02:33:32.721]  And information is the fuel of the financial world.
[02:33:32.781 --> 02:33:39.409]  Think about how much money is paid for those little bits and pieces of your information and then how it's used.
[02:33:40.090 --> 02:33:47.619]  And how it's used is to manipulate you into buying things and voting for people and to frame your outlook on life.
[02:33:48.557 --> 02:33:53.479]  And this is the truth of the matter, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure it out.
[02:33:53.879 --> 02:34:02.462]  Think about how weird it is when you look at your internet connections and it's throwing ads at you that you just thought about looking at, you hadn't even made the query yet.
[02:34:03.002 --> 02:34:07.844]  Because these systems can even anticipate better than you can.
[02:34:08.304 --> 02:34:11.565]  Anticipate what you might be interested in and send it your way.
[02:34:12.065 --> 02:34:17.107]  And the higher the data collection, the more little bits and pieces that are gathered together.
[02:34:17.768 --> 02:34:21.014]  The more transparent you are and they don't need a camera.
[02:34:21.615 --> 02:34:22.636]  They just need the data.
[02:34:23.097 --> 02:34:24.920]  So that's why it's so critical.
[02:34:24.980 --> 02:34:28.787]  You know, my my oldest son is in his early early 40s and his
[02:34:30.120 --> 02:34:32.782]  Work has been in this space his entire life.
[02:34:33.083 --> 02:34:33.423]  All right.
[02:34:33.943 --> 02:34:38.287]  And he has 150 people working for him on three different continents.
[02:34:38.767 --> 02:34:38.988]  All right.
[02:34:39.048 --> 02:34:40.169]  And they they do this.
[02:34:40.229 --> 02:34:46.614]  They build they build software for everything from banks, a little little guys doing websites.
[02:34:47.214 --> 02:34:53.600]  And what we know is the amount of data and how it's piped in and collected.
[02:34:54.295 --> 02:34:56.116]  And sorted now, because it can be.
[02:34:56.596 --> 02:34:57.996]  And the sword is where it's at.
[02:34:58.316 --> 02:35:00.877]  And that's where we get the full throttle.
[02:35:00.917 --> 02:35:06.359]  Now, I think as Davos meets again in January, and they're going to try this.
[02:35:06.399 --> 02:35:07.199]  You watch and see.
[02:35:07.239 --> 02:35:12.461]  Between now and January, the chaos that's going to unfold, people are going to be screaming, protect us, save us.
[02:35:13.161 --> 02:35:17.103]  And they're going to use it again for an opportunity to try and get this reset.
[02:35:17.643 --> 02:35:21.484]  Meanwhile, in Asia, something else is happening.
[02:35:22.006 --> 02:35:29.607]  In terms of a breakup of the financial system, see SWIFT, the SWIFT system, how we move money around the world in dollars.
[02:35:29.987 --> 02:35:35.548]  Let me tell you how it works, because I do move money around the world in dollars and euros sometimes.
[02:35:36.048 --> 02:35:37.069]  And here's what happens.
[02:35:37.569 --> 02:35:45.490]  If I try to move euros into the US, instead of it doing, you know, like you see post to the exchange rates for the day, right?
[02:35:45.970 --> 02:35:51.171]  And like a two or three dollar fee for moving some money from Bank A to Bank B, which is, you know,
[02:35:51.870 --> 02:35:54.151]  It's a nothing transaction, cost a fraction of a cent.
[02:35:54.815 --> 02:35:55.916]  But here's what they do.
[02:35:56.496 --> 02:36:02.201]  They move those euros over into my dollar account and then they rack up seven to eight percent.
[02:36:02.401 --> 02:36:04.883]  They take off the top, the skim for the banks.
[02:36:05.364 --> 02:36:06.324]  And it is a skim.
[02:36:06.365 --> 02:36:08.086]  It's worse than the frickin mob.
[02:36:08.446 --> 02:36:11.569]  Only they call it a transaction cost.
[02:36:12.049 --> 02:36:14.451]  Give it a nice name so you don't feel robbed so much.
[02:36:14.912 --> 02:36:15.832]  So what did I have to do?
[02:36:15.852 --> 02:36:22.578]  I had to re- I have to rethink how I'm doing my banking because I can't sustain an eight percent service charge.
[02:36:23.277 --> 02:36:25.418]  for the skim of the banking institutions.
[02:36:25.458 --> 02:36:26.319]  We had to rethink it.
[02:36:26.819 --> 02:36:29.580]  But what's what happens in the world?
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:31.261]  See, they give us the illusion.
[02:36:31.301 --> 02:36:32.242]  Why don't these U.S.
[02:36:32.282 --> 02:36:33.643]  companies bring their money back?
[02:36:33.703 --> 02:36:37.625]  Would you bring it back if you had to hand off 8% for the bank?
[02:36:38.525 --> 02:36:39.426]  No, of course not.
[02:36:40.166 --> 02:36:49.311]  See, this needs to be regulated to something rational, because if you want international trade, you've got to have a level playing field for little guys.
[02:36:50.208 --> 02:36:57.032]  We're getting into this import-export, and you can't unless you have a lot of money to overcome all these obstacles.
[02:36:57.512 --> 02:37:00.994]  And that is part of the game, you see, is to control that.
[02:37:01.034 --> 02:37:03.515]  So they set up a new system, and it was Chinese.
[02:37:03.535 --> 02:37:04.816]  They invented the world to it.
[02:37:04.876 --> 02:37:09.919]  The Russians joined them, so they can trade in a different basket of currency.
[02:37:10.779 --> 02:37:16.942]  Now, China, I think, is our real adversary in this mix, and Russia's looking to leverage both sides against the middle.
[02:37:17.002 --> 02:37:18.503]  So what have these two countries done?
[02:37:19.024 --> 02:37:19.604]  They've dumped
[02:37:20.476 --> 02:37:21.737]  Massive amounts of U.S.
[02:37:21.837 --> 02:37:24.718]  treasuries, their dollar holdings, and they've replaced them with gold.
[02:37:25.158 --> 02:37:25.658]  Look it up.
[02:37:26.179 --> 02:37:26.739]  You'll see.
[02:37:27.159 --> 02:37:34.162]  They've been stockpiling and buying the base commodities, the big three, copper, gold, silver, for decades.
[02:37:34.462 --> 02:37:34.862]  Why?
[02:37:35.343 --> 02:37:37.303]  Because they need an alternative.
[02:37:37.343 --> 02:37:41.225]  Because you can create a system that's outside of the SWIFT system.
[02:37:41.265 --> 02:37:42.886]  You can do international banking.
[02:37:43.586 --> 02:37:47.588]  That's why Bitcoin, for a lot of people, is too erratic, you know, in terms of pricing.
[02:37:47.608 --> 02:37:49.349]  You don't have any logical
[02:37:50.209 --> 02:37:50.509]  I think so.
[02:38:17.734 --> 02:38:22.956]  So an alternative in the international world is coming in terms of how you bank.
[02:38:23.477 --> 02:38:33.601]  So that's going to create real competition within the banking system and allow people to sidestep American boycotts, American sanctions and have another way to do business.
[02:38:34.081 --> 02:38:37.443]  And that's what they're doing because of the way that we do business.
[02:38:37.463 --> 02:38:38.023]  And I get it.
[02:38:38.383 --> 02:38:40.584]  I understand everybody's out for their own interest.
[02:38:41.025 --> 02:38:44.246]  But this is the thing that Donald Trump defined for America.
[02:38:45.350 --> 02:38:53.375]  As our interests weren't being protected, and as soon as they started being protected, all our allies, our long-lost friends, disappeared.
[02:38:54.355 --> 02:38:55.756]  Think of our European allies.
[02:38:55.776 --> 02:39:02.960]  For 70 years bailing them out of World War II so they weren't, you know, Nazi-ville from coast to coast, from sea to signing sea in Europe.
[02:39:03.624 --> 02:39:04.744]  We stood in the way of that.
[02:39:04.824 --> 02:39:06.105]  We made sure that didn't happen.
[02:39:06.145 --> 02:39:07.685]  Then we rebuilt all of Europe.
[02:39:08.266 --> 02:39:13.007]  And then we decided that it's an unfair equation because we're paying for all their defense, for most of their defense.
[02:39:13.647 --> 02:39:15.528]  I think that is an unfair equation.
[02:39:16.008 --> 02:39:20.229]  It's allowed them to have great health care for their citizens that we don't have in this country.
[02:39:20.289 --> 02:39:25.991]  It's allowed them to have reasonable cost education, which we don't have in this country, for college and university.
[02:39:26.912 --> 02:39:27.992]  Because they had the money.
[02:39:29.692 --> 02:39:31.233]  Because we were covering the defense.
[02:39:31.986 --> 02:39:32.867]  And now they're angry.
[02:39:32.947 --> 02:39:35.069]  Oh, they're mad at us because we're pulling back.
[02:39:35.749 --> 02:39:39.952]  It's a matter of public policy, a matter of where we're headed.
[02:39:39.972 --> 02:39:47.398]  And globalists would like to keep the American voices like Alex, mine, and a lot of others on this network silent.
[02:39:48.119 --> 02:39:52.362]  Because this is the time when truth needs to ring through.
[02:39:52.562 --> 02:39:59.428]  And these matrix running organizations that are filtering out our voices, they need to be stopped.
[02:39:59.947 --> 02:40:03.110]  If we're going to save this republic, they need to be stopped.
[02:40:03.711 --> 02:40:08.376]  There needs to be executive orders to stop them now because they're interfering with these elections.
[02:40:08.936 --> 02:40:13.821]  Free and fair elections come with a free and fair media and not a muzzled voice in the land.
[02:40:14.281 --> 02:40:16.343]  This is Dr. Nick Begich to the tip of the spear.
[02:40:16.383 --> 02:40:17.084]  We'll be right back.
[02:40:18.145 --> 02:40:19.086]  And welcome back.
[02:40:19.186 --> 02:40:21.168]  It's good to be here on this Friday afternoon.
[02:40:21.208 --> 02:40:23.771]  You know that so much happens in the course of
[02:40:24.837 --> 02:40:25.217]  A week.
[02:40:25.277 --> 02:40:28.098]  And I know there's a lot of fear in the air.
[02:40:28.138 --> 02:40:29.398]  I mean, I can feel it.
[02:40:29.458 --> 02:40:34.579]  I mean, it's gotten to the point for a lot of people.
[02:40:34.819 --> 02:40:40.080]  And I know a lot of our listeners are just in a state of close to panic.
[02:40:40.140 --> 02:40:50.002]  And I want to say this is even in the craziest of times, we've got to find a breath, a bit of calm in it.
[02:40:51.015 --> 02:40:56.480]  And I know we touch on so many topics here, and I don't want to add to that fire of fear.
[02:40:56.560 --> 02:40:58.461]  I want to try and tamp it down a bit.
[02:40:59.262 --> 02:41:00.383]  And that's the whole purpose.
[02:41:00.563 --> 02:41:03.965]  Provide information so at least we kind of know what's going on.
[02:41:04.366 --> 02:41:07.048]  We have an opportunity to maybe rethink it a little bit.
[02:41:08.008 --> 02:41:20.298]  The electronics, you know, I've talked about this again for decades about sort of how we were becoming so dependent on these systems that they end up trapping us in a system.
[02:41:20.948 --> 02:41:21.448]  And we are.
[02:41:21.548 --> 02:41:24.489]  Most of us are trapped to a certain degree.
[02:41:24.589 --> 02:41:26.069]  That's unavoidable at the moment.
[02:41:27.190 --> 02:41:30.430]  But we need to analyze how that trap has been constructed.
[02:41:30.910 --> 02:41:31.871]  And it's been slow.
[02:41:31.971 --> 02:41:33.251]  It's not been a quick run.
[02:41:33.711 --> 02:41:39.672]  But they're now ramping it up because they feel like they got the cover to the COVID-19 panic.
[02:41:40.173 --> 02:41:41.173]  I don't think they do.
[02:41:41.313 --> 02:41:50.235]  I think as things unfold, if the leadership can stand up to it, and certainly there isn't a Christian soul that I know that'll take a tattoo or a mark.
[02:41:51.391 --> 02:41:52.512]  To engage in commerce.
[02:41:53.193 --> 02:41:56.175]  And I would say no to that.
[02:41:56.235 --> 02:41:58.357]  I'm not going to do that to engage in commerce.
[02:41:59.958 --> 02:42:06.663]  We need to recognize that our bodies are not something for the government to tamper with.
[02:42:06.723 --> 02:42:07.844]  Now, the U.S.
[02:42:07.884 --> 02:42:13.688]  Supreme Court has ruled on that in the case of women and abortions, right?
[02:42:14.474 --> 02:42:22.062]  But they haven't ruled on that in a case of somebody getting an involuntary tattoo or an involuntary vaccine.
[02:42:22.602 --> 02:42:32.212]  And it seems to me that there's a balance between public risk and privacy that's not been well articulated by the U.S.
[02:42:32.432 --> 02:42:33.133]  Supreme Court.
[02:42:33.852 --> 02:42:40.541]  First, as it relates to commerce and free trade, should they invade our bodies in order to engage in commerce?
[02:42:40.561 --> 02:42:50.574]  I don't think that's a fair question and certainly we don't pose a risk to anyone else by engaging with the use of currency.
[02:42:51.175 --> 02:42:55.176]  And to suggest otherwise is really a trap.
[02:42:56.656 --> 02:42:58.416]  There is a way to do this.
[02:42:58.676 --> 02:43:03.217]  And Bitcoin, people say, oh, let's go to the digital Bitcoin because you won't know who's who.
[02:43:03.677 --> 02:43:12.359]  Believe me, if it's a government-instituted program, it will provide a clear roadmap to the chain of title on every currency exchange from the beginning to the end.
[02:43:12.899 --> 02:43:15.439]  So, no, it creates tracking.
[02:43:15.499 --> 02:43:19.200]  It's just a question of who has coding to interpret that tracking.
[02:43:19.961 --> 02:43:26.088]  The bottom line is, it is all part of, again, the formation of a matrix.
[02:43:26.168 --> 02:43:28.051]  If you control it all, then you get it all.
[02:43:28.692 --> 02:43:30.694]  And really, that's where we're at.
[02:43:31.615 --> 02:43:35.881]  Freedom is something that entails a certain amount of risk.
[02:43:37.404 --> 02:43:40.065]  That's part of the cost of a democracy.
[02:43:40.525 --> 02:43:46.566]  We hear a lot of dialogue about gun control in the context of everything else that's being thrown at us.
[02:43:47.186 --> 02:43:53.947]  And I think we're going to hear more of that because ultimately tyranny is offset by a citizenry that's armed.
[02:43:53.967 --> 02:43:57.588]  You know, and I'm not suggesting violence.
[02:43:57.648 --> 02:44:01.468]  It's just kind of a general deterrence, like having a nuke in the ground.
[02:44:01.528 --> 02:44:04.189]  You know, you know, you hope you never have to launch it, right?
[02:44:04.609 --> 02:44:05.369]  It's a deterrence.
[02:44:06.073 --> 02:44:08.994]  And the thing that's happening with government is they're overstepping.
[02:44:09.674 --> 02:44:13.875]  And they're stepping on our necks, every one of us at this point.
[02:44:14.515 --> 02:44:15.716]  And they're holding us down.
[02:44:15.776 --> 02:44:21.497]  It's not about George Floyd being his neck being stepped on.
[02:44:22.157 --> 02:44:27.339]  That's a really the symbol of what's going on with government against all of us.
[02:44:27.439 --> 02:44:29.099]  It's not police brutality.
[02:44:29.179 --> 02:44:30.199]  It's not any of that.
[02:44:30.879 --> 02:44:32.840]  But it's this sense of
[02:44:33.891 --> 02:44:37.412]  Put a mask on and then what do you think of when you're wearing that mask?
[02:44:37.832 --> 02:44:39.432]  You think, I can't breathe.
[02:44:40.352 --> 02:44:42.533]  Wow, isn't that an interesting correlation?
[02:44:44.353 --> 02:44:49.454]  Makes you stop and think because patterning of the mind requires a repetition.
[02:44:50.454 --> 02:44:51.135]  Put it on.
[02:44:51.355 --> 02:44:52.435]  What do you say to yourself?
[02:44:52.495 --> 02:44:53.675]  You're complying again.
[02:44:53.735 --> 02:44:55.175]  You're falling in line.
[02:44:55.195 --> 02:44:57.556]  You're staying in the square at school, whatever it is.
[02:44:58.366 --> 02:45:15.683]  This is the deal right now, is change the way we think, give a whole new way of being that we accept this sort of group think, group being, and allow them to put us at each other's throat over a mask.
[02:45:16.684 --> 02:45:17.104]  Really?
[02:45:18.826 --> 02:45:19.046]  Over
[02:45:20.223 --> 02:45:26.926]  All of this that's happening right now, just amplify that fear and then just keep pushing the herd along.
[02:45:27.486 --> 02:45:28.527]  And that's what's happening.
[02:45:29.207 --> 02:45:31.828]  Personal privacy is not just at stake.
[02:45:32.699 --> 02:45:37.262]  Whether we ever have it again or not is what we're talking about.
[02:45:38.002 --> 02:45:45.067]  Some of you know I engaged in this local activity regarding the homeless issue, and I used data in that.
[02:45:45.727 --> 02:45:55.493]  And because of the consultants I used, and we looked at what they were doing and I went, whoa, I really, I don't like this.
[02:45:56.674 --> 02:45:57.734]  I don't like this.
[02:45:58.455 --> 02:45:59.996]  I don't like the idea.
[02:46:00.632 --> 02:46:15.282]  That I can go and capture everything that Facebook is doing in my community, that I can isolate that audience, that I can tailor ads and disperse them into that audience or through Google's networks and do that.
[02:46:15.482 --> 02:46:16.383]  I don't like that.
[02:46:18.364 --> 02:46:20.486]  We did that on this campaign.
[02:46:20.586 --> 02:46:23.908]  I'll confess it because I really believe that's what's required.
[02:46:24.248 --> 02:46:25.089]  I won't do it again.
[02:46:25.109 --> 02:46:28.011]  I don't think it's the right way, but I know that every campaign
[02:46:29.930 --> 02:46:38.734]  Every effort that's being thrown at you in this election season is using this kind of data and manipulating it to push you along.
[02:46:39.914 --> 02:46:41.215]  And this is the problem.
[02:46:41.515 --> 02:46:43.035]  They're trying to push you along.
[02:46:44.056 --> 02:46:50.178]  And every time they throw a poll at you on the internet and say, hey, click here, click there, click this, click that, don't do it anymore.
[02:46:50.959 --> 02:46:51.979]  You're just surrendering.
[02:46:51.999 --> 02:46:53.780]  You're kicking open your door for them.
[02:46:54.560 --> 02:46:55.680]  Don't do it anymore.
[02:46:56.241 --> 02:46:57.661]  You want to screw up polling?
[02:46:58.121 --> 02:46:59.502]  Don't respond to polling.
[02:47:00.040 --> 02:47:01.861]  Don't give them the wrong information, give them no information.
[02:47:01.881 --> 02:47:11.126]  When they lay out the demographics, they look at all the voter profiles, and they set up phone numbers they're going to call, so they get a representative sampling from all those profiles.
[02:47:11.727 --> 02:47:16.769]  If people don't give them the data, they can't develop the data and use it against you.
[02:47:17.130 --> 02:47:22.012]  That's why they were 16 points off in the last presidential election, and everyone forgets.
[02:47:22.553 --> 02:47:26.615]  Because now they're leaning in these stupid-ass polls again, and they are.
[02:47:27.415 --> 02:47:27.795]  Dumb.
[02:47:28.135 --> 02:47:29.116]  Dumb, dumb, dumb.
[02:47:29.616 --> 02:47:31.256]  Because they're not accurate.
[02:47:31.917 --> 02:47:33.237]  They're missing too many people.
[02:47:33.617 --> 02:47:37.919]  And those of us that are smart enough to quit participating are quitting participating.
[02:47:37.979 --> 02:47:40.880]  Don't volunteer any more than they're already paid from.
[02:47:41.700 --> 02:47:45.761]  I hope to God the next administration, and if it's Democrats, it'll never happen.
[02:47:46.762 --> 02:47:50.583]  I hope to God there's time for us to take our data back.
[02:47:51.223 --> 02:47:56.885]  That this president, through executive order, could shut all that down right now and make it illegal for them to do what they're doing.
[02:47:58.995 --> 02:48:00.377]  Something has to happen.
[02:48:01.218 --> 02:48:11.712]  The steps that are being taken now are the ones that are the biggest steps against this country's individual sovereignty that have ever been taken in our entire history.
[02:48:12.133 --> 02:48:15.858]  The war that's been waged, not a bullet has been fired.
[02:48:16.781 --> 02:48:22.088]  You know, and you look at how they've used Russia and China as the boogeyman to get us to give up more.
[02:48:22.629 --> 02:48:24.772]  Oh, no, they're invading our elections.
[02:48:24.812 --> 02:48:25.573]  What are we going to do?
[02:48:26.314 --> 02:48:27.535]  Sure, they're going to try.
[02:48:27.636 --> 02:48:28.617]  Why wouldn't they try?
[02:48:28.677 --> 02:48:29.378]  We do it, too.
[02:48:29.458 --> 02:48:30.700]  We do it all over the world.
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:31.581]  It's documented.
[02:48:32.142 --> 02:48:38.447]  But Cambridge Analytica, which doesn't exist anymore, now they've been fractured and split off into new companies.
[02:48:38.507 --> 02:48:39.348]  I don't know how many.
[02:48:39.968 --> 02:48:41.530]  But they did something.
[02:48:41.570 --> 02:48:42.170]  This is it.
[02:48:42.310 --> 02:48:44.272]  This is the book that brought it all to light.
[02:48:44.552 --> 02:48:45.072]  Targeted.
[02:48:45.473 --> 02:48:50.457]  There were other things that brought it to light too, but there's such a precision.
[02:48:50.497 --> 02:48:56.141]  Over 60 governments, elections around the world were influenced by this one group alone.
[02:48:56.602 --> 02:48:59.464]  And now they're splattered all over the place.
[02:49:00.060 --> 02:49:09.557]  And all these collectors of data that aggregate that data to manipulate all of us into doing things that otherwise we wouldn't do.
[02:49:09.637 --> 02:49:10.799]  So what is the solution?
[02:49:11.778 --> 02:49:16.001]  Stay tuned to InfoWars as long as we're here to give you information.
[02:49:16.561 --> 02:49:19.123]  Look at the alternative medias that are out there.
[02:49:19.703 --> 02:49:21.945]  And really look at the opposite side.
[02:49:22.345 --> 02:49:23.686]  Get to know your opposition.
[02:49:24.266 --> 02:49:28.629]  Read the headlines at least of the New York Times to see how they're BSing us.
[02:49:28.649 --> 02:49:32.972]  You can do that for free online so you don't have to buy anything and support their rag.
[02:49:33.292 --> 02:49:35.093]  But you do need to know what they're saying.
[02:49:35.133 --> 02:49:39.456]  You need to know what the Washington Post is saying, what the LA Times is saying, what the Chicago Tribune is saying.
[02:49:39.896 --> 02:49:48.838]  What the Seattle papers are saying, you need to know so you can know your adversary, you know what kind of garbage they're pumping into the minds of this next generation.
[02:49:49.358 --> 02:49:51.378]  And then we need to be the voice.
[02:49:52.219 --> 02:49:55.439]  The voice that changes the direction and the narrative.
[02:49:55.979 --> 02:49:58.500]  The narrative that they've created is a false one.
[02:49:58.540 --> 02:50:00.460]  It's a script being followed by too many.
[02:50:01.020 --> 02:50:02.901]  Rewrite your individual script.
[02:50:03.521 --> 02:50:06.781]  Rewrite the script that a government is shoving down our throat.
[02:50:07.282 --> 02:50:09.222]  This is the election season.
[02:50:10.146 --> 02:50:11.767]  And let's think about what we know.
[02:50:12.188 --> 02:50:14.109]  The mainstream media is unreliable.
[02:50:14.149 --> 02:50:15.210]  Don't rely on them.
[02:50:15.750 --> 02:50:18.973]  Everybody knows the lamestreet media is not the answer.
[02:50:19.513 --> 02:50:21.815]  InfoWars, tip of the spear.
[02:50:21.955 --> 02:50:22.516]  That's you.
[02:50:22.576 --> 02:50:24.237]  Thanks for being here this Friday afternoon.
[02:50:35.905 --> 02:50:40.831]  The first time I used activated charcoal toothpaste was back in 2018.
[02:50:40.871 --> 02:50:45.277]  And I was like, whoa, my mouth is so fresh, so clean.
[02:50:45.317 --> 02:50:47.039]  My teeth are so white.
[02:50:47.119 --> 02:50:48.461]  I've never felt something like this.
[02:50:48.501 --> 02:50:49.062]  What's going on?
[02:50:49.422 --> 02:50:50.784]  It was a major leading brand.
[02:50:51.164 --> 02:50:53.247]  So I brought it to my dad, who's a retired dentist.
[02:50:53.607 --> 02:51:09.794]  He brought it to a big company we use that's produced some other high quality toothpaste that we've sold and I said I want basically to clone this major brand but I want to take the fillers and things out that experts had told us other dentists and oral surgeons could strip off enamel from the teeth.
[02:51:10.254 --> 02:51:22.499]  So we have produced activated charcoal toothpaste that is enamel safe and doesn't damage your teeth while still cleaning really really intensely and it's so good for your gums and it's got a bunch of other
[02:51:22.679 --> 02:51:22.879]  Yes!
[02:51:42.165 --> 02:51:55.430]  You will see nine other products that he developed with other top supplement developers, not just the toothpaste, and you'll also find the activated charcoal mouthwash that he's produced, and people that have already gotten it are giving it five star reviews.
[02:51:55.850 --> 02:52:06.394]  We also sell the whole line at InfoWareStore.com, but wherever you get it, it will fund the InfoWare and support us up against globalist attacks to be able to fight these tyrants into the future.
[02:52:06.694 --> 02:52:10.516]  I have been shaped by many things in my lifetime, but the strongest influence has been my father.
[02:52:10.916 --> 02:52:15.918]  He always taught me to be a straight shooter and give people the highest quality in business and you'll be successful.
[02:52:16.218 --> 02:52:16.798]  We've done that.
[02:52:16.858 --> 02:52:17.699]  We've been successful.
[02:52:17.839 --> 02:52:24.221]  That's why we have Dr. Jones Naturals at InfoWarsTore.com and DrJonesNaturals.com as well.
[02:52:24.521 --> 02:52:25.521]  It's all high quality.
[02:52:25.541 --> 02:52:26.422]  It doesn't have fillers.
[02:52:26.702 --> 02:52:27.722]  It doesn't have additives.
[02:52:28.022 --> 02:52:33.724]  It just has ingredients that are known to work and absolutely deliver to you so you're happy and you order again.
[02:52:34.085 --> 02:52:35.005]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:52:38.425 --> 02:52:43.511]  As men age, they may often experience a loss in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[02:52:46.354 --> 02:52:49.117]  That's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.

[02:53:20.678 --> 02:53:24.202]  It's no secret that Super Male Vitality is one of our best-selling formulas.
[02:53:24.542 --> 02:53:26.043]  See why at InfowarsStore.com today.
[02:53:46.536 --> 02:53:47.396]  New court filings.
[02:53:47.436 --> 02:53:50.777]  Ghislaine Maxwell fled across house during raid.
[02:53:50.937 --> 02:53:53.258]  FBI found tinfoil-wrapped cell phones.
[02:53:53.338 --> 02:53:56.659]  And they found her with a phone she was trying to get rid of, wrapped in tinfoil.
[02:53:56.719 --> 02:53:57.980]  Now why would she do that?
[02:53:58.000 --> 02:54:01.181]  Because the big genius spy did not have one of these.
[02:54:01.261 --> 02:54:02.041]  And now I'm gonna plug.
[02:54:02.161 --> 02:54:04.902]  This is a Privacy Pocket 1995.
[02:54:06.322 --> 02:54:10.144]  Other people sell these with the copper Faraday cage for 30 bucks.
[02:54:10.504 --> 02:54:10.944]  That's a 200% markup.
[02:54:10.964 --> 02:54:11.664]  This is a 100% markup.
[02:54:14.855 --> 02:54:15.956]  You cannot get a better deal.
[02:54:15.976 --> 02:54:19.678]  These are the best pockets they take from small to large cell phones.
[02:54:19.958 --> 02:54:22.800]  We have them in red, royal blue, green and black.
[02:54:22.961 --> 02:54:35.809]  You put your phone in it and then all the cell towers that every few seconds are pinging where you're at and tracking and getting your data and selling it to the highest bidder and hackers that are busy stealing the data and all the other big corporations have different wireless systems that are stealing your data as well.
[02:54:35.889 --> 02:54:38.211]  You protect yourself and your data from the
[02:54:38.371 --> 02:54:41.775]  Bill and Melinda Gates and the Clinton Foundation contact tracers.
[02:54:41.815 --> 02:54:51.044]  You protect yourself from all of these people and it is so critical that all of us habituate ourselves and get in the habit now of putting our cell phones, we're not using them, in one of these.
[02:54:51.164 --> 02:54:53.046]  It'll still go in your pocket like it's no big deal.
[02:54:53.146 --> 02:54:54.568]  I fit my cell phone right in here.
[02:54:55.489 --> 02:54:56.210]  I slide it right in.
[02:54:58.171 --> 02:55:03.074]  It easily folds over, fits in my pocket, slips right in, back pocket, front pocket, or inside of your coat.
[02:55:03.214 --> 02:55:05.336]  And you've got it, and they can't track and trace you.
[02:55:05.376 --> 02:55:09.619]  And when you want to take your phone out, then you take your phone out, and it doesn't know where you've gone or what you've done.
[02:55:09.679 --> 02:55:11.760]  This is a basic thing like locking your front door.
[02:55:11.780 --> 02:55:14.622]  It's a basic thing like putting clothes on when you go outside during the day.
[02:55:15.182 --> 02:55:18.685]  It needs to be done, and it's a great product at InfoWareStore.com.
[02:55:19.025 --> 02:55:20.066]  Very affordably priced.
[02:55:20.126 --> 02:55:24.368]  Get your protection privacy pockets at InfoWareStore.com today or 888-253-3139.
[02:55:24.509 --> 02:55:25.309]  Whatever you do, take action.
[02:55:36.274 --> 02:55:39.695]  Have you tried taking the Real Red Pill?
