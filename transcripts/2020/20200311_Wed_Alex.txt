[00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:04.892]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:05.013 --> 00:00:23.005]  I'm gonna put the call out that you call the White House and tell them, look, we've seen the news stories that you've wanted to blow things up, that you have blown things up, and that you're saying that four million of us are gonna die and we need martial law and the Associated Press.
[00:00:24.987 --> 00:00:26.668]  And one of your little drills you had,
[00:00:28.812 --> 00:00:31.274]  And that we're aware of who the terrorists are if you pull this.
[00:00:31.634 --> 00:00:34.416]  This can stop the Sittlerian Reichstag event.
[00:00:34.456 --> 00:00:43.483]  The idea that when you're being attacked for delivering an idea or investigating something, that might be a sign that you're on the right track.
[00:00:43.503 --> 00:00:46.866]  9-11 was real.
[00:00:48.907 --> 00:00:56.053]  Planes flew into the Pentagon and flew into the World Trade Center's Tower 1 and 2.
[00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.212]  A large projectile hit the Pentagon and two planes hit the towers.
[00:01:01.553 --> 00:01:09.178]  And I've studied it, made five films, written a book about it, interviewed NSA top people and CIA and firefighters and police that were there.
[00:01:09.198 --> 00:01:11.239]  It happened.
[00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.442]  Out of this you will see a re-engineering of American society.
[00:01:15.502 --> 00:01:21.467]  I believe in the next few years you will see even larger attacks, perhaps even biological, chemical or nuclear.
[00:01:21.947 --> 00:01:25.509]  Biological being the worst of the three, obviously.
[00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.231]  When we exposed
[00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.920]  The fact that there were anomalies and cover-ups of the stand-down.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:37.444]  The media said, Alex Jones says nobody died of 9-11 and that no planes hit it.
[00:01:38.084 --> 00:01:43.967]  That was a minority of people saying holograms that were put out there, we later learned, most of them by the CIA.
[00:01:44.007 --> 00:01:47.069]  It came out to discredit the whole movement.
[00:01:48.035 --> 00:01:55.776]  And later there were even articles in the National Post in Canada where they admitted that leftist professors had gone out and done that because they thought it would damage the view of government.
[00:01:56.337 --> 00:01:58.737]  And so they thought it was the best thing to do was cover it up.
[00:01:58.777 --> 00:02:09.959]  So what do you do when I'm pointing out, hey, the head of the Labor Department, Transportation Department said they were in the bunker and saw Dick Cheney order the stand down, told Congress that.
[00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.200]  During the time that the airplane coming in to the Pentagon,
[00:02:15.467 --> 00:02:21.169]  Uh, there was a young man who would come in and say to the vice president, the plane is 50 miles out.
[00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.289]  The plane is 30 miles out.
[00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:26.890]  And when it got down to the plane is 10 miles out.
[00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.592]  Um, the young man also said to the vice president, do the orders still stand?
[00:02:34.893 --> 00:02:39.834]  And the vice president turned and whipped his neck around and said,
[00:02:40.558 --> 00:02:41.820]  Of course the orders still stand.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.062]  Have you heard anything to the contrary?
[00:02:44.162 --> 00:02:48.908]  So why am I talking about coronavirus and 9-11?
[00:02:48.928 --> 00:02:50.750]  9-11 was real.
[00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.072]  It killed 3,000 people.
[00:02:52.132 --> 00:02:53.193]  It was a new Pearl Harbor.
[00:02:54.114 --> 00:02:55.396]  Radical Islam is real.
[00:02:55.596 --> 00:02:56.657]  They do attack people.
[00:02:57.298 --> 00:02:58.179]  They were involved.
[00:02:59.042 --> 00:03:16.034]  Piggybacked on the Islamists' planning it were a bunch of shadowy agencies and globalist operations that ordered to stand down and put bombs in the buildings and put bombs in Building 7 that was the second largest CIA headquarters in the world after Lanley, Virginia.
[00:03:17.816 --> 00:03:22.360]  And I interviewed the Deputy Head of Emergency Management, and a week later he was dead!
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:36.412]  He said, yeah, there were bombs, they told us, they were on the news saying, we're gonna blow up Building 7, and then I interviewed cops that said, yeah, it was over the Red Cross radios, get back, they're gonna blow up Building 7, and then the media spun it that I said cops blew it up.
[00:03:37.053 --> 00:03:44.640]  Then about six years later, the globalists don't even think, BBC and all of them start releasing on 9-11 the archives of the full day.
[00:03:46.556 --> 00:03:47.396]  And guess what?
[00:03:47.516 --> 00:03:53.779]  CBS, CNN, BBC, ABC, NPR.
[00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.900]  I made a film about it.
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:55.560]  I have it all in there.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.440]  It's like 30 minutes of film.
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.562]  All announced that the government's gonna blow up Building 7.
[00:04:00.622 --> 00:04:05.024]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[00:04:07.048 --> 00:04:09.150]  Well, only really what you already know.
[00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:10.791]  Details are very, very sketchy.
[00:04:11.111 --> 00:04:16.955]  As you can see behind me, the Trade Center appears to be still burning.
[00:04:16.975 --> 00:04:18.276]  COVID-19.
[00:04:18.296 --> 00:04:19.277]  9-11 on steroids.
[00:04:19.317 --> 00:04:20.277]  The report goes on.
[00:04:20.337 --> 00:04:23.400]  It's posted at band.video and newswars.com.
[00:04:24.861 --> 00:04:28.703]  And you can see them blow up Building 7 and admit they blew it up, then later say it's a conspiracy theory.
[00:04:29.724 --> 00:04:31.205]  Stay with us for the biggest news ever.
[00:04:33.246 --> 00:04:36.429]  Chronicling the incredible era that we all live in.
[00:04:37.361 --> 00:04:39.624]  As the future destiny of humanity is charted.
[00:04:40.484 --> 00:04:44.188]  With 236 days out from the historic critical election.
[00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.154]  And just a few weeks out from total, complete, absolute...
[00:04:50.765 --> 00:04:54.047]  Coronavirus hysteria setting in.
[00:04:54.788 --> 00:04:59.311]  All perfectly plotted, all perfectly prepared by the CHICOMS and the GLOBALIST.
[00:04:59.671 --> 00:05:04.795]  A man made by a weapon rolled out that does kill people is highly communicable.
[00:05:05.476 --> 00:05:14.022]  But the push and the propaganda and the precedent set by CHICOMS, now GLOBALIST-run Italy, the controlled corporate media,
[00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:21.903]  The big tech companies is to run in abject lemming-like fear off the edge of a cliff.
[00:05:22.503 --> 00:05:32.169]  If you were sitting in a coffee shop on a Monday morning at 8 a.m., about to go to work, and you saw 20 people running down the street saying, they've got guns, they're telling everyone, run, get out of here, help!
[00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:37.572]  You would get up and you would look down the street and you'd go for shelter.
[00:05:38.072 --> 00:05:39.733]  Because it's the knowledge of the crowd.
[00:05:41.914 --> 00:05:43.495]  Just like if you've got a bunch of
[00:05:46.109 --> 00:05:46.790]  We're good to go.
[00:06:07.128 --> 00:06:12.391]  That's why crows always fly in pairs, because they're, while one's eating and doing something, or drinking, the other's watching.
[00:06:12.691 --> 00:06:16.293]  And they fly in larger groups, always in pairs, because hawks and owls kill them.
[00:06:17.834 --> 00:06:22.497]  And so, you'll see a crow fly down to drink, but always sitting on a tree.
[00:06:22.777 --> 00:06:27.920]  Another one lands, and then they sit, he flies down and drinks, the other one flies back up, the other flies down and drinks.
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:36.585]  And if you get up, while you're fishing from your chair, even 50 yards away, 100 yards away, 200 yards away to go get another beer or whatever out of your cooler,
[00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.552]  And the other one flies and goes in a circle and they have a discussion.
[00:06:45.352 --> 00:06:46.753]  That's our instincts.
[00:06:46.893 --> 00:06:48.534]  That's how we're designed.
[00:06:51.061 --> 00:07:01.469]  And so when you see people being welded into their homes, and women being shot in the head at checkpoints, and all of this craziness, and the media six weeks ago was like, this is good to weld people in their homes.
[00:07:01.529 --> 00:07:03.150]  It's good to shoot women in the head at checkpoints.
[00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.813]  It's good that Russia and India and all these countries have said no flights from China.
[00:07:08.634 --> 00:07:14.799]  But then we do it, and the media says Trump's evil, America's bad, and China says so, and the UN does, and I said, oh my God.
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:20.283]  They want it to come here, they want it to incubate, they're gonna blame Trump for a lack of response.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:27.563]  They're going to tell you it's not a big deal, it's not communicable, but show you the hysteria so you get scared.
[00:07:28.024 --> 00:07:29.324]  You know the media is lying to you.
[00:07:29.745 --> 00:07:33.067]  So I've always told the media, if you ever wanted to hurt a candidate, endorse them.
[00:07:33.787 --> 00:07:34.428]  Well, it's the same thing.
[00:07:35.368 --> 00:07:45.175]  Come out and say it's no big deal six weeks ago, but then show the juxtaposed hysteria by the government taking place, people are going to get very unsettled by the mixed messages.
[00:07:46.936 --> 00:07:49.958]  And then as the deaths begin to mount, the hysteria begins to mount.
[00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:53.880]  And it started about two weeks ago, as predicted.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:59.342]  Bill Maher, CNN, MSNBC, all praising the virus, saying, oh, I hope it hurts the economy.
[00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:00.582]  It's a good price to pay.
[00:08:00.602 --> 00:08:01.282]  It's worth it.
[00:08:01.302 --> 00:08:01.902]  These are quotes.
[00:08:02.643 --> 00:08:03.563]  Incredible statements.
[00:08:04.323 --> 00:08:06.884]  And now it's just a steady drumbeat.
[00:08:07.244 --> 00:08:12.686]  And the left has fully embraced it and says it's going to destroy America, that they've always hated.
[00:08:12.706 --> 00:08:18.508]  And they've got big Reuters polls out last Friday that coronavirus
[00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:22.252]  Beliefs split along party lines.
[00:08:23.493 --> 00:08:25.854]  Republicans believe it's not a big deal.
[00:08:26.614 --> 00:08:30.456]  Democrats believe it's the end of America because it's what they want.
[00:08:30.776 --> 00:08:31.677]  It's their ethos.
[00:08:33.818 --> 00:08:38.160]  So whether, again, the virus is super deadly or not, the hype is 100% real.
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:44.283]  Just like you fire a firearm off and it, by the feet of a cow,
[00:08:45.413 --> 00:08:48.636]  And it gets a big herd of cows to get scared, and they start running.
[00:08:49.336 --> 00:08:56.463]  And once a herd of cows starts running, it'll run through fences, it'll run across roads, it'll run over people, and they'll just run right off the edge of a cliff.
[00:08:58.444 --> 00:09:04.710]  In fact, go to YouTube, there's even famous black-and-white footage of cattle stampedes, real ones, where there's cows just flying off the edge of a cliff.
[00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:06.251]  Walrus sizzle stampede?
[00:09:08.093 --> 00:09:08.513]  You name it.
[00:09:08.773 --> 00:09:09.654]  Lemming stampede?
[00:09:10.094 --> 00:09:11.496]  Humans stampede!
[00:09:12.446 --> 00:09:18.131]  So, whether there's a danger to the cows or not, they're scared.
[00:09:19.552 --> 00:09:22.434]  A backfire off a truck makes one cow get scared.
[00:09:22.554 --> 00:09:25.817]  It hits another cow with its horn.
[00:09:26.317 --> 00:09:27.178]  That cow bolts.
[00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:32.222]  And all the cows know is, hey, a bunch of other cows are scared and are bolting.
[00:09:33.363 --> 00:09:39.148]  And they know, cows know, a couple hundred cows running at them is dangerous, so they just turn and start running with the herd.
[00:09:41.638 --> 00:09:43.039]  Because they're not leaders.
[00:09:43.939 --> 00:09:44.939]  They're a prey animal.
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:50.982]  Now, you don't see tigers and lions and bears or killer whales getting stampeded.
[00:09:52.282 --> 00:09:56.264]  You don't see advanced species that are at the top of the food chain getting spooked.
[00:09:59.425 --> 00:10:03.967]  You can have a pride of lions and there's a hundred hyenas and there's five or six
[00:10:05.103 --> 00:10:21.547]  Lions, and they've all got their quadrant, and they're taking care of what they're doing, and even if a bunch of hyenas come in at one, they're going to maintain the perimeter, and like soldiers, all line up with their asses together, and they're all in sync, because they're a predator.
[00:10:22.587 --> 00:10:25.848]  They're not for dinner.
[00:10:27.289 --> 00:10:30.689]  And they hold the line like the 300 at Gallipoli against the 50,000 Persians.
[00:10:33.851 --> 00:10:40.152]  Because they're not getting spooked, and they're not backing down, and they're not running, and they're going to keep fighting until they die.
[00:10:41.613 --> 00:10:52.035]  Most wars are not won because the overwhelming 460 defeat of the enemy.
[00:10:52.115 --> 00:10:55.536]  It's because you panic the enemy and make them drop their weapons and run.
[00:10:55.576 --> 00:11:00.797]  That's what the Greeks would say, the Spartans would say, the women would say, when the men were leaving, come home with
[00:11:03.109 --> 00:11:04.950]  Your shields are on them.
[00:11:08.032 --> 00:11:16.196]  And, like the history books, if the men actually ever ran, when they got back, everyone would shun them, no one would talk to them, they would just have to commit suicide or, you know, leave.
[00:11:17.076 --> 00:11:19.817]  But nobody turned and ran because that was the culture, you didn't do it.
[00:11:20.038 --> 00:11:21.598]  But the women said, come home.
[00:11:21.658 --> 00:11:28.722]  They say the women say their sons, especially when they're first going off to battle at like age 15, you come home with the shields are on them.
[00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:35.674]  Which means you don't drop your weapons, and you don't back down, and you don't get panicked.
[00:11:37.615 --> 00:11:40.155]  And that means you get prepared, it means you get ready.
[00:11:40.635 --> 00:11:47.497]  There's a big Mother Jones article out attacking us saying, Jones sells supplements that he claims protect you against coronavirus.
[00:11:47.737 --> 00:11:49.137]  They've got fake quotes, everything.
[00:11:49.157 --> 00:11:50.858]  They reported this to the government, trying to get us in trouble.
[00:11:51.218 --> 00:11:53.819]  And they play on people's ignorance and say, these aren't FDA approved.
[00:11:54.119 --> 00:11:55.699]  No supplement is FDA approved.
[00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:58.530]  It's in a separate category.
[00:11:58.550 --> 00:11:59.730]  They know that they play this game.
[00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.371]  Like, Jones is selling illegal weed or something.
[00:12:02.391 --> 00:12:05.233]  Or, you know, Jones is selling bathtub meth.
[00:12:05.653 --> 00:12:06.794]  They play on this garbage.
[00:12:09.615 --> 00:12:18.619]  But the truth is, we showed you the documents from the Pentagon and from A&M saying nanosilver of this type is known to kill viruses.
[00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:19.220]  That's a fact.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.442]  You go to the hospitals now, they've got all this nanosilver product, the same ones we sell.
[00:12:24.673 --> 00:12:29.216]  Yeah, 25 years ago they tried to ban nano-silver and colloidal silver, that's a precursor of it.
[00:12:30.036 --> 00:12:34.158]  It's like a Model T, you know, versus a brand new high-tech car.
[00:12:34.699 --> 00:12:35.659]  But still the same thing.
[00:12:36.339 --> 00:12:38.901]  And so they're like, they're like, oh look, he's selling silver!
[00:12:39.141 --> 00:12:42.363]  Yeah, Walmart just ordered 3 million frickin' bottles of the same stuff.
[00:12:42.703 --> 00:12:45.745]  They went to the company we made it with and said, we want it and got it.
[00:12:46.245 --> 00:12:48.006]  They won't have it for months, we've got it right now.
[00:12:48.246 --> 00:12:50.427]  The 18-wheeler arrives tomorrow from Colorado.
[00:12:50.767 --> 00:12:53.369]  But, you lose left,
[00:12:55.066 --> 00:13:05.711]  Trying to act like it's weird and it's bad to say, if there's not a vaccine for this, and the vaccines are deadly anyways most of the time, then why wouldn't you take vitamin D?
[00:13:05.731 --> 00:13:08.292]  They're like, oh, and he also sells fish oil.
[00:13:08.452 --> 00:13:08.912]  Oh my God.
[00:13:09.172 --> 00:13:16.535]  I mean, any moron, your medical doctor will tell you that you want to take fish oil, whether you're a child or an old man or a woman, for everything.
[00:13:16.575 --> 00:13:17.456]  It's incredible.
[00:13:18.576 --> 00:13:19.537]  You want high-end fish.
[00:13:19.617 --> 00:13:22.078]  I mean, it's just like, Jones sells fish oil.
[00:13:22.138 --> 00:13:22.718]  What a kook.
[00:13:24.485 --> 00:13:27.386]  Oh yeah, and then he sells wound cream.
[00:13:27.706 --> 00:13:29.527]  You know, he claims that... You know, it's funny though.
[00:13:29.547 --> 00:13:31.268]  A lot of stuff we sell is not even in the supplement class.
[00:13:31.308 --> 00:13:33.689]  It's actually FDA for over-the-counter.
[00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:34.669]  We just private label it.
[00:13:34.689 --> 00:13:36.610]  This is the strongest silver you can get over-the-counter.
[00:13:37.750 --> 00:13:38.371]  This isn't even a plug.
[00:13:38.391 --> 00:13:38.991]  I was talking about this.
[00:13:40.472 --> 00:13:41.972]  The strongest silver you can get over the counter.
[00:13:41.993 --> 00:13:43.833]  American nanotech company puts it out.
[00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:44.733]  We private label it.
[00:13:44.973 --> 00:13:45.854]  Do not ingest this.
[00:13:46.174 --> 00:13:47.934]  It kills germs for a reason.
[00:13:47.974 --> 00:13:49.415]  It's nasty stuff.
[00:13:50.175 --> 00:13:55.437]  The point is that it's much weaker level and good at that level in the toothpaste and the skin cream and all the rest of it.
[00:13:55.457 --> 00:14:03.299]  But the idiot leftists are so anti-human and so anti-everything, they're not just creating new national holidays, the Democrats are, for abortion.
[00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:04.280]  Oh, wait till I cover that.
[00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:09.364]  They literally don't want you to know about silver that God gave us.
[00:14:09.404 --> 00:14:13.207]  I mean, these people are sick, but no one listens to them anymore.
[00:14:14.588 --> 00:14:17.310]  It is completely transparent.
[00:14:17.831 --> 00:14:19.052]  There is no longer any doubt.
[00:14:21.434 --> 00:14:30.962]  The whole globalist corporate model, with the EU, the UN, the CHICOMS, the leftists in the United States and North America, has been in total crisis.
[00:14:31.142 --> 00:14:32.823]  They're losing every major election.
[00:14:33.988 --> 00:14:42.295]  And the global economy was coming back under real free trade and free market reforms.
[00:14:44.276 --> 00:14:45.637]  America was leading the way.
[00:14:45.657 --> 00:14:53.724]  A century of not America, but of American ideals expanding.
[00:14:53.744 --> 00:15:02.251]  1776 worldwide was on track for absolute success.
[00:15:05.799 --> 00:15:06.820]  I woke up at 4 a.m.
[00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:30.656]  this morning and I spent hours just sitting in a chair in the kitchen, drinking a cup of coffee over an hour, not answering the phone, not reading news, but really deeply dwelling, cogitating, as a cogitor, on the poor tins and the information we know and the tea leaves.
[00:15:37.355 --> 00:15:39.036]  It is an engineered man-made bio-weapon.
[00:15:39.176 --> 00:15:39.696]  That's confirmed.
[00:15:40.076 --> 00:15:40.977]  They don't want that discussed.
[00:15:41.717 --> 00:15:42.777]  Because that's their Achilles heel.
[00:15:45.058 --> 00:15:45.999]  It's been deployed.
[00:15:46.359 --> 00:15:48.680]  It has a low kill rate.
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:50.121]  2% or so with the elderly.
[00:15:50.221 --> 00:15:50.981]  That's super bad.
[00:15:51.461 --> 00:15:53.802]  Maybe 0.25%, 0.5% general public.
[00:15:53.842 --> 00:15:54.563]  Still a big deal.
[00:15:54.603 --> 00:15:55.783]  Still want to get prepared for that.
[00:15:56.323 --> 00:16:00.345]  People that are, you know, talking about the worst-hit scenarios, like Mike Adams, very reasonable.
[00:16:00.405 --> 00:16:02.406]  You need somebody to, you know, look at it from that perspective.
[00:16:02.746 --> 00:16:06.848]  To then form the dialectic and figure out the synthesis of what's really going on.
[00:16:08.976 --> 00:16:12.277]  As a roadmap to understand the new data as we get it, to look at it from all spectrums.
[00:16:12.637 --> 00:16:15.718]  That's multiple dimension, third dimensional, fourth dimension thinking.
[00:16:17.799 --> 00:16:28.682]  But it's clear they released it and they're studying it ahead of a more powerful weapon to come, perhaps in the same family, the climate's mutation.
[00:16:30.728 --> 00:16:40.835]  In the next six months, this is a priming beta test to see if we'll lock down, to see how we'll behave with a half a percent or a two percent death rate.
[00:16:43.337 --> 00:16:57.627]  And then, if we prostrate ourselves and freak out and limbing eyes off the edge of cliffs, they're going to release a bigger bioweapon months before the election.
[00:17:00.953 --> 00:17:09.745]  That will then be replicating into hysteric levels and killing 3, 4, 5, 10 percent of those that get hit with it.
[00:17:10.907 --> 00:17:15.953]  But the globalists aren't going to test their whole global system with something huge up front.
[00:17:15.973 --> 00:17:17.155]  They're going to beta test it.
[00:17:17.175 --> 00:17:18.477]  That's the way the corporates operate.
[00:17:19.864 --> 00:17:28.220]  They've taken baby steps with the SARS and the Ebola and all of it that they've been souping up and releasing and now they give you something that does spread really fast.
[00:17:29.082 --> 00:17:31.346]  They hold back how many people are infected.
[00:17:33.942 --> 00:17:42.210]  So that when the testing kits finally come out and you find out, oh my God, most of us have it, it creates a giant hysteria.
[00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:47.554]  But then the system is there to save us and tell us what it is we've got to do to protect ourselves.
[00:17:47.935 --> 00:17:53.300]  This is a domestication indoctrination program.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:55.121]  And everybody already knows that.
[00:17:55.201 --> 00:17:56.503]  But if you quantify it,
[00:17:57.421 --> 00:18:11.286]  That it's man-made, that it's been released, that you've had concerted big tech, and authoritarian countries and others, all synergistically off the same sheet of music, and who are they saying is bad?
[00:18:11.427 --> 00:18:21.150]  Even when he agrees with them at some point, early on, Trump was just trying to be a team player, had no idea how bad this really was, how serious their treachery is, and they turn around and go, oh, you said G.G.
[00:18:21.170 --> 00:18:25.112]  Pink did a great job, you said, but now you messed up, you did bad, what's coming is your fault.
[00:18:26.144 --> 00:18:33.770]  So I'll tell President Trump, I was already saying this about three weeks ago, that I thought there'd be other strains, that this was a cover for something bigger.
[00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:36.171]  And now I'm sure of it.
[00:18:36.271 --> 00:18:37.672]  And now we see them saying that.
[00:18:37.992 --> 00:18:39.333]  So they're priming the pump.
[00:18:39.833 --> 00:18:41.855]  They always tell you what they're going to do before they do it.
[00:18:42.395 --> 00:18:44.997]  And let me just tell everybody, if you're not getting chills, you're crazy.
[00:18:45.418 --> 00:18:51.102]  Everybody doesn't need the media to scare them to want to go out and get food and get guns and get ready.
[00:18:51.402 --> 00:18:54.905]  Because this is, whoa, I just got the biggest chill I've ever had.
[00:18:55.505 --> 00:19:00.990]  I mean, like, when I'm on target, man, the Holy Spirit's just like, bzzz, and I'm like, oh boy, we're over the target.
[00:19:02.622 --> 00:19:05.806]  Beyond the veil, the spirit world, God's saying, that's it.
[00:19:06.987 --> 00:19:07.448]  That's it.
[00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:10.171]  That's it.
[00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:11.512]  This is what the globalists are doing.
[00:19:11.592 --> 00:19:12.714]  We know what it is.
[00:19:13.515 --> 00:19:14.356]  This is an attack.
[00:19:16.578 --> 00:19:18.741]  But so you need to get not hysterical.
[00:19:18.781 --> 00:19:19.842]  You need to get right with God.
[00:19:19.862 --> 00:19:22.405]  You need to tell everybody that it's a staged event.
[00:19:23.772 --> 00:19:35.183]  And you need to then take action by spreading the word to others so people understand that this is an attack on our markets, it's an attack on our confidence, it's an attack on the fact that the whole global system is falling apart.
[00:19:37.665 --> 00:19:48.756]  I'm going to come back into the details of the coronavirus and some other things, but I do just want to remind all of you that anything I promote is what I really believe is the best thing that needs to be done.
[00:19:50.578 --> 00:20:03.447]  So let me just show TV viewers, since Mother Jones is demonizing us in a very deceptive formulaic piece where they show other people that the FDA has gotten mad at, who have made claims and violated FDA regulations.
[00:20:03.828 --> 00:20:13.354]  The FDA says they don't regulate supplements, but then they'll come after you if you say you need water to live, or sunshine's good for you, or you've got to have vitamin C to live, or you've got to have oxygen.
[00:20:13.375 --> 00:20:15.216]  If you don't have oxygen in four minutes, you die.
[00:20:15.436 --> 00:20:17.658]  Seriously, they say you cannot say oxygen is good.
[00:20:17.698 --> 00:20:19.319]  Well, you don't want to have a first amendment, I'm going to do it.
[00:20:20.399 --> 00:20:29.783]  I'm not joking, by the way, because Big Pharma does not want to compete with what Mother Nature has given us and what God's given us.
[00:20:30.944 --> 00:20:33.265]  Okay, babies don't need formula, they need mother's milk.
[00:20:33.325 --> 00:20:35.626]  Well, the FDA doesn't want you saying that.
[00:20:35.666 --> 00:20:36.466]  Well, piss up a rope.
[00:20:37.486 --> 00:20:40.608]  Because they want everything to be artificial, and it's political.
[00:20:41.068 --> 00:20:44.790]  Because big corporations control the FDA, and they control the left.
[00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.151]  But more and more, they've lost.
[00:20:46.832 --> 00:20:49.733]  25 years ago, the FDA said coital silver's bad, silver's horrible.
[00:20:49.893 --> 00:20:52.455]  All the other hospitals, 10 years ago, they'd all adopted it.
[00:20:53.115 --> 00:20:53.956]  Because it works.
[00:20:55.477 --> 00:21:00.500]  So, I want to show listeners and viewers a couple things, and we're going to break here.
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:04.762]  I just want to show you the type of research I do before I even talk about stuff on air.
[00:21:05.202 --> 00:21:05.963]  Dr. McCamshaw, please.
[00:21:07.503 --> 00:21:09.805]  Vazovich just got back in stock today.
[00:21:09.825 --> 00:21:15.029]  40% off, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:21:16.671 --> 00:21:19.853]  Now, what does nitrous oxide do in the immune response?
[00:21:20.474 --> 00:21:28.680]  Here's a major study, go look it up yourself, there's a study, look it up, about what it does boosting the entire system.
[00:21:29.141 --> 00:21:30.442]  It's incredible, there's a bunch of these studies.
[00:21:32.082 --> 00:21:35.030]  It's Rowan Immunity, all these other big scientific studies.
[00:21:35.451 --> 00:21:37.136]  Nitrous Oxide, Immune System, A.
[00:21:38.476 --> 00:21:39.136]  It's just all there.
[00:21:39.476 --> 00:21:42.458]  The role of nitrous oxide, the regulation of adaptive immune responses.
[00:21:43.158 --> 00:21:45.059]  It's a super charger.
[00:21:45.659 --> 00:21:48.440]  We have a super concentrated beet extract.
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:52.641]  One of the strongest you're going to find out there at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:21:52.721 --> 00:21:55.022]  It's not just good for your heart and vascular systems.
[00:21:55.082 --> 00:21:56.443]  It's good for the cells.
[00:21:56.703 --> 00:21:58.304]  It's back in stock 40% off.
[00:21:58.644 --> 00:22:02.025]  This is the type of thing I'm giving my children because you can give them a lot of it.
[00:22:04.614 --> 00:22:06.355]  Or just go to the store and boil some beets.
[00:22:07.055 --> 00:22:08.215]  You'll get a lot of the good stuff.
[00:22:08.256 --> 00:22:11.177]  It's not concentrated like this, and this is a cold process.
[00:22:11.497 --> 00:22:15.398]  Boiling them makes them tastier, but I love beets, but it's not as good for you.
[00:22:16.359 --> 00:22:21.681]  Also, we have the whole line of nano-silver.
[00:22:22.101 --> 00:22:22.521]  Oh, look!
[00:22:23.101 --> 00:22:26.503]  Here's the University of A&M confidential with Homeland Security.
[00:22:27.847 --> 00:22:39.535]  Talking about this nano-silver, and Andrew von Eckenbach, MD, Commissioner of Food and Drug Administration, Department of the Army, and their findings that the American Biotech Labs takes out the SARS-Corona family of viruses.
[00:22:39.555 --> 00:22:41.296]  Well, of course nano-silver does.
[00:22:41.536 --> 00:22:42.497]  It knocks it all out.
[00:22:43.058 --> 00:22:46.980]  Doesn't mean it might not still get into you and take you over, but when it makes contact with it, boom!
[00:22:47.621 --> 00:22:48.501]  And it's in our toothpaste.
[00:22:48.521 --> 00:22:49.082]  We'll be right back.
[00:22:50.843 --> 00:22:53.525]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, hell has frozen over.
[00:22:54.687 --> 00:22:58.890]  And I'm sure they'll make amends for it by going back to lying, as they're already doing in many other areas.
[00:22:59.491 --> 00:23:02.873]  CNN came out and told the truth about me, at least partially.
[00:23:03.914 --> 00:23:10.279]  So I'm going to hit that, just because it's so interesting, and it's a larger perspective, a keyhole into a larger world.
[00:23:10.299 --> 00:23:16.003]  And then I'm going to get into the giant developments, the ultra-massive developments on the coronavirus front, here in just a moment.
[00:23:16.063 --> 00:23:19.005]  But first, look at this CNN headline.
[00:23:19.846 --> 00:23:23.989]  Infowars Alex Jones accused of DWI.
[00:23:26.659 --> 00:23:35.223]  Thousands of newspapers, every TV channel that you randomly check, because the globalists hate me, they use the CIA Mockingbird program.
[00:23:35.243 --> 00:23:43.686]  I've had former high-level CIA operatives who ran propaganda for the State Department on Pchenik, saying, no, they're using Mockingbird against you, and Obama is still in control of it.
[00:23:45.007 --> 00:23:49.248]  Everyone else is saying, I was arrested for DWI, I committed to DWI.
[00:23:49.568 --> 00:23:53.090]  Even other CNN headlines say Alex Jones gets DWI.
[00:23:55.128 --> 00:23:59.032]  But this one CNN headline says Alex Jones accused of DWI.
[00:24:01.754 --> 00:24:06.119]  And I didn't know they'd change the Texas policy.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:12.004]  I guess at the state level, it's not a law that if you admit that you've drank, they take you to jail.
[00:24:12.958 --> 00:24:17.986]  So you either don't ever drink again, like a one beer, two beers at a restaurant, or just lie to them.
[00:24:18.407 --> 00:24:22.514]  I said, yeah, about two hours ago I had a part of a small bottle of sake.
[00:24:22.534 --> 00:24:25.579]  Not the little tiny bottle, not the big bottle, the little medium-sized bottle of my wife.
[00:24:26.949 --> 00:24:29.692]  And they found out, they went and checked and everything and found out it's true.
[00:24:29.872 --> 00:24:31.413]  It's all, I can't believe the investigation they did.
[00:24:32.575 --> 00:24:35.077]  But I guess I am well known, that's why they did it.
[00:24:36.038 --> 00:24:37.219]  What's the name of that place?
[00:24:37.239 --> 00:24:38.580]  I'm like, well, it's this place.
[00:24:39.581 --> 00:24:44.026]  And they get me to the jail, they test me 30 minutes later, and it's below the legal limit.
[00:24:44.546 --> 00:24:51.333]  That means I wasn't driving while intoxicated, except the state law says, unless you couldn't walk the tightrope,
[00:24:51.613 --> 00:24:54.901]  Stand on one leg with it extended with your toe down for 10 seconds.
[00:24:55.543 --> 00:24:56.886]  Almost no one can do that.
[00:24:57.067 --> 00:24:58.109]  Everybody knows it's a fraud.
[00:24:58.450 --> 00:25:00.154]  I passed one of the tests.
[00:25:00.274 --> 00:25:01.116]  Failed two of the tests.
[00:25:02.912 --> 00:25:10.453]  I did a better job with adrenaline that night than trying to do it with one of my security guys that's a registered, trained, former police officer, you know, in DWIs.
[00:25:10.513 --> 00:25:11.974]  He knows them frontwards and backwards.
[00:25:12.214 --> 00:25:16.494]  He can do it like a Prussian war horse, you know, they can prance and everything just perfectly.
[00:25:16.954 --> 00:25:18.315]  But most of the police can't do it.
[00:25:18.375 --> 00:25:22.635]  The police officer was showing me how to do the extend the foot in front of you, point the toe down.
[00:25:23.656 --> 00:25:24.956]  He couldn't do it for three seconds.
[00:25:24.996 --> 00:25:27.776]  He goes, oh my, my belt wasn't, he was a little embarrassed about it.
[00:25:27.796 --> 00:25:28.557]  I'm like, come on, dude.
[00:25:28.877 --> 00:25:30.737]  He was like a young former military guy, nice guy, but.
[00:25:31.926 --> 00:25:33.267]  It's designed so you can't do it.
[00:25:33.767 --> 00:25:40.071]  But now, I've said I'm never drinking again, and I can go a year, four months, as long as, you know, I'm gone as a year, years ago.
[00:25:40.371 --> 00:25:42.913]  I'm just done, because they're not going to have that power over me in the system.
[00:25:43.433 --> 00:25:49.376]  Because now, you tell the cops, yeah, I had a half bottle of sake, a small bottle a couple hours ago.
[00:25:50.557 --> 00:25:56.561]  I later learned from people at the jail, deputies off record and others, they said, dude, you say that, you're going to jail.
[00:25:57.241 --> 00:25:58.722]  And because of lawyers and the rest of it,
[00:26:00.219 --> 00:26:00.699]  They don't
[00:26:21.826 --> 00:26:23.427]  But that's not the issue here.
[00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:25.289]  That's not the issue here.
[00:26:25.969 --> 00:26:35.796]  The issue is that every other channel, including CNN, if they've got other false headlines, say that I've been convicted, or I've been indicted, or that it's been proven.
[00:26:36.277 --> 00:26:38.619]  A DWI is, in Texas, 0.8.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:40.420]  I wasn't.
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:42.061]  Zero point, I was below that.
[00:26:42.882 --> 00:26:44.143]  But even, that's crazy.
[00:26:44.383 --> 00:26:46.264]  It used to be, 30 years ago, 1.5.
[00:26:49.872 --> 00:26:52.593]  That's like a six-pack for an average person in a couple hours.
[00:26:52.693 --> 00:26:54.033]  And yeah, you probably shouldn't be driving, done that.
[00:26:54.513 --> 00:26:59.834]  But how do you have bars and restaurants everywhere where you go out to brunch on a Sunday?
[00:26:59.874 --> 00:27:01.275]  Yeah, I'll have a mimosa or two.
[00:27:01.335 --> 00:27:02.555]  I don't even get a buzz off that.
[00:27:02.575 --> 00:27:03.915]  It kind of relaxes you a little bit.
[00:27:04.315 --> 00:27:05.116]  Maybe you feel it.
[00:27:05.876 --> 00:27:06.716]  You're a big guy like me.
[00:27:06.736 --> 00:27:07.576]  I mean, I don't even feel it.
[00:27:08.156 --> 00:27:09.037]  My wife drinks it.
[00:27:09.097 --> 00:27:10.217]  Yeah, she might get, you know.
[00:27:11.733 --> 00:27:26.617]  So, it's the unified propaganda of the media that every major channel, every major newspaper is Jones at a DWI.
[00:27:27.377 --> 00:27:32.579]  But CNN actually in a report, in those little slideshow reports, got it right and said, I'm accused of a DWI.
[00:27:34.019 --> 00:27:35.500]  Because that's what that is.
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.220]  And they keep lowering the limit.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.120]  Some states I heard have gone down to 0.6.
[00:27:42.398 --> 00:27:49.342]  For the average weight, I look this up, that's a beer and a half or a tall beer.
[00:27:50.703 --> 00:27:53.965]  You can't drink a beer and leave a restaurant.
[00:27:54.285 --> 00:28:01.289]  So I think it's time, I'm serious, to either change these laws and raise the level or you can't sell alcohol.
[00:28:02.561 --> 00:28:03.881]  Um, out of a restaurant.
[00:28:04.001 --> 00:28:13.003]  And I'm not trying to hurt restaurants, I'm just saying, you can't sit there and let somebody drink a half a bottle of a small wine bottle and then you can't drive?
[00:28:16.784 --> 00:28:20.605]  And now they've got all these electronic testers coming out that know if you've had marijuana or anything else.
[00:28:20.645 --> 00:28:22.985]  Folks, it needs to be reckless driving.
[00:28:23.846 --> 00:28:24.866]  If someone's swerving,
[00:28:26.024 --> 00:28:33.690]  If someone's driving erratically, and that's observed, you pass laws, and then if they're on something, it's reckless driving while impaired.
[00:28:35.291 --> 00:28:42.076]  But the idea that you're doing nothing wrong, while you're five miles over in the speed limit, Jones, and we're gonna... Did you drink anything?
[00:28:42.096 --> 00:28:42.897]  Yeah, a couple hours ago.
[00:28:43.137 --> 00:28:46.860]  And because I told the truth now, I went to jail.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.941]  And when they breathalyzed me, they found out I wasn't lying to them.
[00:28:51.303 --> 00:28:54.725]  You think I'm gonna go and get behind the wheel of a car and have a high alcohol level?
[00:28:56.092 --> 00:28:59.673]  I can't say in my lifetime I haven't done that before, but certainly not these days.
[00:28:59.733 --> 00:29:02.834]  I went again four months just last year not drinking a damn drop.
[00:29:03.294 --> 00:29:04.995]  And I can tell you, that's the case now.
[00:29:05.295 --> 00:29:06.495]  I was already taking next week off.
[00:29:06.535 --> 00:29:08.616]  I'll call on the show some, but I'm going to go exercise.
[00:29:08.636 --> 00:29:09.456]  I'm going to go hiking.
[00:29:10.317 --> 00:29:12.197]  I'm going to spend some time with the children.
[00:29:13.097 --> 00:29:17.299]  And I'm going to be so free of it that I'm never going to drink again.
[00:29:18.239 --> 00:29:20.280]  Because there's obviously a big target painted on my back.
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.800]  I don't blame this deputy.
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.501]  I'm not quite sure why he did it.
[00:29:24.461 --> 00:29:27.684]  Uh, because, I mean, I did a good job on those sobriety tests.
[00:29:27.944 --> 00:29:30.846]  I mean, he just kept going and going and going.
[00:29:30.866 --> 00:29:33.108]  Like, he'd have the pen out here for like 30 seconds.
[00:29:33.648 --> 00:29:36.470]  He'd go, oh, well, it wasn't my eye fluttering.
[00:29:36.610 --> 00:29:40.513]  I can't, I'm not going to sit there and look at your stupid pen for 30 seconds at one position.
[00:29:41.934 --> 00:29:43.175]  I've been up since 4 a.m.
[00:29:43.936 --> 00:29:46.017]  I've done all day work, took care of my kids.
[00:29:46.037 --> 00:29:47.058]  I haven't gone out and eaten.
[00:29:49.608 --> 00:29:59.111]  And then, that's what happens in America, but the borders wide open, and the illegal aliens can run people over, and shoot people, and commit crimes, and the sanctuary cities won't even arrest them, and won't even give them to ICE!
[00:29:59.431 --> 00:30:10.274]  But because I'm a citizen, and I work hard, and all the rest of it, I have a legal level of alcohol in my body, and I still
[00:30:11.761 --> 00:30:13.001]  Have been, quote, charged.
[00:30:13.041 --> 00:30:18.803]  Now it's going to get dismissed, obviously, but that's how they leave this discretion in of, oh, well, you didn't walk the tightrope right.
[00:30:18.843 --> 00:30:22.284]  But again, CNN, let's roll this minute and a half little piece.
[00:30:22.624 --> 00:30:23.964]  Part of the slideshow, I'll talk over it.
[00:30:24.844 --> 00:30:25.824]  Telling the partial truth.
[00:30:26.285 --> 00:30:32.746]  InfoWars founder, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones arrested in Texas and charged with drug and alcohol intoxication.
[00:30:32.766 --> 00:30:35.567]  Jones, 46, spoke out on his show saying he was unfairly arrested.
[00:30:37.779 --> 00:30:41.980]  Then they got a clip of where I talk about it and I show the alcohol level.
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:43.480]  And of course, the people, they went and got the file.
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.440]  That's exactly what I said.
[00:30:47.921 --> 00:30:49.901]  And again, who knows how they're going to calibrate these machines.
[00:30:49.921 --> 00:30:51.841]  They had me blow and blow and blow.
[00:30:52.202 --> 00:30:57.222]  Innocent Alex Jones arrested for DWI and was below the legal limit.
[00:30:58.243 --> 00:31:00.883]  And it goes on to say, I did do that.
[00:31:00.903 --> 00:31:06.284]  And the fact that you can also fail the sobriety test, which again is a total fraud.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:13.268]  And they're going to say, even if you don't have the alcohol in your blood, I guess if you can't walk a tightrope, you're going to jail.
[00:31:15.481 --> 00:31:16.362]  I did walk the tightrope.
[00:31:16.382 --> 00:31:19.365]  Later I learned you're supposed to not pivot around if you do the 10 steps.
[00:31:19.745 --> 00:31:21.607]  You're supposed to do little baby steps around.
[00:31:22.127 --> 00:31:25.130]  So that's the type of games the system plays, and it's up to us to change the laws.
[00:31:25.390 --> 00:31:26.391]  I'm not going to blame the cops.
[00:31:26.631 --> 00:31:27.872]  I'm not going to blame the TSA.
[00:31:28.093 --> 00:31:30.555]  Their borders are wide open, but they're groping little kids' ding-dongs.
[00:31:31.175 --> 00:31:37.942]  I'm going to blame the American people for not taking our government back and changing all this, and I want these laws changed.
[00:31:38.973 --> 00:31:41.014]  And I want real drunk drivers prosecuted.
[00:31:41.034 --> 00:31:46.197]  I don't want innocent people that go out to a restaurant and have two beers, or whatever, thrown in jail.
[00:31:46.617 --> 00:31:51.980]  I'm done talking about it, but why is it such a huge... It's as big as the coronavirus!
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:52.621]  It's everywhere!
[00:31:52.641 --> 00:31:53.661]  It's on the front of the papers!
[00:31:54.161 --> 00:31:57.563]  Because it's about demonizing me, so you don't listen to what I have to say.
[00:31:57.603 --> 00:31:58.764]  Oh, that's that drunk guy.
[00:31:58.984 --> 00:32:00.805]  That's that guy that's got a DWI.
[00:32:01.025 --> 00:32:02.486]  That's that guy that doesn't have his kids.
[00:32:02.526 --> 00:32:03.467]  I have my kids full-time.
[00:32:04.187 --> 00:32:05.548]  But it's all lies.
[00:32:05.568 --> 00:32:06.389]  But here's the good news.
[00:32:06.449 --> 00:32:07.630]  You know they're a pack of liars.
[00:32:08.231 --> 00:32:09.032]  And that's the good news.
[00:32:09.252 --> 00:32:10.293]  Infowars.com.
[00:32:12.115 --> 00:32:14.537]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:32:14.597 --> 00:32:15.578]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[00:32:15.618 --> 00:32:17.800]  I'm about to hit the latest on the coronavirus.
[00:32:18.421 --> 00:32:25.787]  The coronavirus and the response to it and the coordinated globalist hysteria is huge to bring down the economy, to bring down President Trump.
[00:32:25.807 --> 00:32:27.849]  They're now announcing other more deadly strains of it.
[00:32:28.723 --> 00:32:34.769]  After they beta test how much they can scare the public that I believe they probably already released and so you should get ready.
[00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:48.341]  I'm going to get into this news here in a moment, but first we have a whole line of products that are known and documented through ancient custom and research and studies to be really good for your body and boost your immune system.
[00:32:48.841 --> 00:32:52.124]  And we have the DNA Force Plus now back in stock.
[00:32:52.845 --> 00:33:00.277]  It is, again, PQQ, CoQ10, and so much more that cleans out the mitochondria that just does so much for your entire body.
[00:33:00.838 --> 00:33:01.399]  It's amazing.
[00:33:01.539 --> 00:33:04.123]  Then we have Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:05.641]  That's right.
[00:33:22.881 --> 00:33:23.081]  I think?
[00:33:53.101 --> 00:33:56.302]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com and Mother Jones got it wrong.
[00:33:56.362 --> 00:33:59.223]  They said we're raising prices during this crisis.
[00:33:59.243 --> 00:34:01.964]  We've actually lowered the prices or kept them the same.
[00:34:02.424 --> 00:34:07.326]  These products are 40 to 50 percent off right now even though the toothpaste is very close to selling out.
[00:34:07.346 --> 00:34:19.210]  So take advantage of that today again at InfoWarsTore.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and VazoBeats that also is so good for your immune system and boost your nitrous oxide.

[00:34:26.276 --> 00:34:30.720]  So thank you all for your support and thank you for supporting your own health and immune system during this critical time.
[00:34:31.541 --> 00:34:31.841]  Okay!
[00:34:35.224 --> 00:34:35.965]  Let's get into it.
[00:34:37.048 --> 00:34:37.869]  Here's what's going on.
[00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:41.033]  A lot of you can tell, we've got a lot of things happening.
[00:34:41.194 --> 00:34:49.985]  And whatever you see in the news against Infowars, believe it, that there's usually ten times or more of that going on below the surface.
[00:34:50.586 --> 00:34:51.948]  We are under siege.
[00:34:52.869 --> 00:34:53.850]  And I love it.
[00:34:54.778 --> 00:34:55.138]  I love it.
[00:34:55.158 --> 00:34:57.619]  People are like, why are you so excited with all the bad stuff happening?
[00:34:57.639 --> 00:35:00.620]  You're on every channel saying you are the scum of the earth.
[00:35:01.140 --> 00:35:02.620]  These are the pedophile protectors.
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.801]  The whole corporate media, the New York Times, ABC News, they covered up Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:35:07.001 --> 00:35:08.422]  They covered up all the pedophile rings.
[00:35:08.442 --> 00:35:09.102]  They covered up your evil.
[00:35:09.522 --> 00:35:17.224]  I am so blessed that the trash of the planet, the criminals of all time are attacking me.
[00:35:18.604 --> 00:35:19.505]  This is amazing.
[00:35:20.645 --> 00:35:24.066]  And I'm glad they're lying about us because that's who they are.
[00:35:25.444 --> 00:35:29.168]  And they're the ones that are saying Trump's had a horrible response.
[00:35:29.208 --> 00:35:32.871]  They're the ones saying the virus is super ultra deadly and everything should be shut down.
[00:35:33.712 --> 00:35:35.594]  Whether, again, the virus is as bad as they say or not.
[00:35:37.015 --> 00:35:43.902]  Because this is their response to the nation-state and globalism being defeated and globalism being in so much trouble.
[00:35:44.002 --> 00:35:48.126]  And if the world wakes up to that, we'll shrug off the deaths of 1%, 2%.
[00:35:50.615 --> 00:36:10.570]  It's been released, it's man-made, but the globalists wanted us off air by now because they wanted you shut up, because they're never going to get away, never, with the fact it's man-made and Measure University's confirmed it, and it's obviously man-made, and people couldn't believe they'd release it when it was man-made.
[00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:11.710]  They thought, well, it must be an accident.
[00:36:11.951 --> 00:36:17.795]  No, they just think we're all dumb and just release a man-made virus so they know what it's gonna do, it's already been tested in the laboratory.
[00:36:20.546 --> 00:36:25.389]  And now CNN, all of them, are celebrating to bring down the President and bring down America.
[00:36:25.589 --> 00:36:26.969]  I mean, here's another clip.
[00:36:28.070 --> 00:36:30.151]  There's like 10 or 15 of these clips.
[00:36:30.171 --> 00:36:31.212]  I can't even play them all.
[00:36:31.752 --> 00:36:39.376]  Here's a clip of the Democrats openly saying how coronavirus can help Democrats.
[00:36:39.396 --> 00:36:43.859]  We're going to play that and then show you the hysteria now setting in in America.
[00:36:43.899 --> 00:36:44.199]  Here it is.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:57.471]  We've also never seen a situation like this, certainly in modern times, in terms of a potential pandemic influencing the next couple of months in a way that's kind of hard to even imagine.
[00:36:57.491 --> 00:37:08.821]  I mean, obviously there's the difference on health care between Sanders and Biden, but if hospitals are overwhelmed, if the military is called in, if people are being...
[00:37:09.562 --> 00:37:15.385]  You know, triaged in school gymnasiums on respirators or whatever, however bad it may get.
[00:37:15.405 --> 00:37:15.765]  Yeah.
[00:37:15.785 --> 00:37:16.705]  And let's hope it doesn't.
[00:37:16.885 --> 00:37:20.847]  Nothing makes you appreciate a functional government like a global pandemic.
[00:37:21.087 --> 00:37:22.728]  Right.
[00:37:23.088 --> 00:37:23.828]  I've always said that.
[00:37:24.009 --> 00:37:24.569]  Yeah, I know.
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:32.586]  Andrew Yang, nothing makes you appreciate a functioning government.
[00:37:32.767 --> 00:37:41.421]  Oh, like Communist China, and like Italy, and now when Trump doesn't just want to shut everything down and join the hysteria, it's his, it's, it's his fault.
[00:37:41.602 --> 00:37:42.243]  Let's continue.
[00:37:43.534 --> 00:37:44.275]  I've always said that.
[00:37:44.455 --> 00:37:46.417]  Yeah, no, that's true.
[00:37:46.437 --> 00:37:55.405]  I mean, none of us, there's very few people who have seen what happens when a society, you know, has the potential to really burst at the seam.
[00:37:55.465 --> 00:38:04.273]  Yeah, Joe Biden's argument has been about sort of a return to moral normalcy, but it's also going to begin to look like a return to competence
[00:38:04.813 --> 00:38:13.035]  Because Trump and the Republicans have been running the government in sort of an anti-government frame, which is not what you want when you're dealing with a health crisis.
[00:38:13.535 --> 00:38:24.437]  And we all know when Joe becomes our president, he's going to bring back many of the Obama alums who are really, really competent and technocratic.
[00:38:24.937 --> 00:38:32.639]  And there's going to be real hunger for that in the days to come among many, many Americans if the coronavirus crisis continues to grow.
[00:38:33.639 --> 00:38:37.102]  A hunger for technocratic rule.
[00:38:37.382 --> 00:38:38.623]  That's direct Bilderberg.
[00:38:38.643 --> 00:38:44.007]  I mean, I remember 20 years ago getting secret Bilderberg documents that people gave me out of National Archives of U.S.
[00:38:44.027 --> 00:38:48.150]  Senators and, like, getting death threats from the Pentagon over it.
[00:38:48.431 --> 00:38:51.093]  But now they just, well, Bloomberg's a technocrat.
[00:38:51.133 --> 00:38:53.434]  He'll, computers will run your life that we program.
[00:38:54.295 --> 00:38:55.356]  So you just heard that.
[00:38:55.456 --> 00:38:56.357]  They're going to use it.
[00:38:56.457 --> 00:38:57.417]  They are using it.
[00:38:58.118 --> 00:38:59.299]  He's got a sign on his chest.
[00:38:59.319 --> 00:39:00.440]  He doesn't even wear an American flag.
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:01.200]  It says math.
[00:39:01.581 --> 00:39:02.902]  But that's the math he programs.
[00:39:03.956 --> 00:39:05.037]  That's the math he controls.
[00:39:05.517 --> 00:39:07.198]  And oh, Trump is bad.
[00:39:07.478 --> 00:39:10.459]  Just like a month ago, he didn't want Chinese flights coming in, he was bad then too.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:17.703]  So, they're gearing this up to wreck America, activate their riot squads, activate their antifa, and it's all clear.
[00:39:19.144 --> 00:39:21.645]  So the debate about how deadly it is, that isn't even an issue now.
[00:39:22.205 --> 00:39:27.308]  The issue is, it's hype to bring down the economy and to terrorize everybody, and they're going to use every institution they can.
[00:39:27.548 --> 00:39:31.070]  The Council on Foreign Relations has canceled an event on coronavirus.
[00:39:32.472 --> 00:39:34.993]  Last time I checked, the Dow's down 1,000 points today.
[00:39:35.393 --> 00:39:40.134]  This is the globalists flexing their muscles, making their move, and they're not even hiding it.
[00:39:40.294 --> 00:39:42.835]  They're out in the open saying, this will defeat Trump.
[00:39:43.255 --> 00:39:47.817]  So you wonder what they'd do when all the other frauds, the Russiagate and the rest of it failed.
[00:39:49.277 --> 00:39:51.278]  You wondered what they would do.
[00:39:52.638 --> 00:39:54.759]  Well, now you know what they'd do.
[00:39:54.799 --> 00:39:56.900]  The Dow's down 1,176 points.
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:40:01.341]  They would praise authoritarian states that launched the attack.
[00:40:02.571 --> 00:40:07.033]  And then say the country that's been at war with China politically and economically is the bad guy.
[00:40:07.933 --> 00:40:08.733]  Unbelievable.
[00:40:08.753 --> 00:40:11.575]  That article is at Infowars.com about the Council on Foreign Relations.
[00:40:11.975 --> 00:40:13.175]  And remember, this is not a spectator sport.
[00:40:13.255 --> 00:40:15.016]  You don't spread the links, the dog don't hunt.
[00:40:16.288 --> 00:40:18.148]  But I don't think this is going to work as well.
[00:40:18.168 --> 00:40:19.108]  We're going to get the word out.
[00:40:19.569 --> 00:40:20.449]  We're going to expose it.
[00:40:20.469 --> 00:40:21.989]  We're going to get ready for the virus.
[00:40:22.509 --> 00:40:25.590]  We're going to really get ready for the civil unrest they're trying to trigger into the election year.
[00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:30.130]  You want election meddling by CHICOMS and the leftists and the CFR and the CIA?
[00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.111]  Don't worry, once Biden's in, the Obama people will be back.
[00:40:33.391 --> 00:40:36.111]  You know, we got Presidency of Obama, his third term.
[00:40:36.451 --> 00:40:37.252]  That's what this is.
[00:40:38.872 --> 00:40:43.313]  That's why he's a placeholder that came and talked, because he'll step down to appoint who they want.
[00:40:44.533 --> 00:40:44.933]  That's it!
[00:40:46.038 --> 00:40:47.139]  Now let's go to this next clip.
[00:40:47.179 --> 00:40:48.419]  This is Tennessee.
[00:40:49.420 --> 00:40:53.002]  Very shameful behavior by the great folks in Tennessee, but Texans act just as hysterical now.
[00:40:53.782 --> 00:40:54.603]  Very, very sad.
[00:40:55.223 --> 00:40:59.625]  And this is parents wear garbage bags, spray students disinfected after coronavirus scare.
[00:40:59.966 --> 00:41:01.707]  This is what hysteria looks like.
[00:41:01.827 --> 00:41:02.867]  But the border's wide open.
[00:41:02.907 --> 00:41:03.748]  Don't worry about that.
[00:41:04.028 --> 00:41:04.708]  Don't block that.
[00:41:04.748 --> 00:41:05.209]  That's bad.
[00:41:05.449 --> 00:41:06.869]  And the airplanes are still flying in.
[00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:12.553]  But let's just run around, you know, it's like leaving your doors open at night but holding a gun on your kids to make sure they don't rob you.
[00:41:12.693 --> 00:41:12.993]  Here it is.
[00:41:14.130 --> 00:41:18.031]  And don't nobody want their child to be sick, and don't nobody want to take that virus to their house.
[00:41:18.311 --> 00:41:22.632]  Parents with children at Treadwell Middle and Elementary schools are not playing around.
[00:41:23.032 --> 00:41:28.374]  Many wiped their kids down, and some even sprayed them with disinfectant spray as they took them home Monday.
[00:41:28.394 --> 00:41:33.115]  I wiped my children's backpacks down when I got them out of school, sure did, gave them gloves, sure did.
[00:41:33.235 --> 00:41:41.858]  Parents are doing this after they found out an employee who works at Treadwell Middle and Elementary came in contact with a person who tested positive for the coronavirus in Memphis.
[00:41:43.058 --> 00:41:45.639]  The scripting's, back up 10 seconds, the scripting's all the same.
[00:41:46.479 --> 00:41:47.240]  The scripting's all the same.
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:52.582]  If you just come and contact us, and the Republicans go along with this too.
[00:41:52.602 --> 00:41:53.122]  Let's continue.
[00:41:55.143 --> 00:41:56.804]  Some took more extreme measures.
[00:41:57.884 --> 00:41:59.005]  Two copies of Max!
[00:42:01.047 --> 00:42:02.168]  My shoes came loose.
[00:42:03.009 --> 00:42:03.790]  Who said?
[00:42:04.410 --> 00:42:04.891]  My kids.
[00:42:04.911 --> 00:42:05.231]  My kids.
[00:42:05.271 --> 00:42:05.852]  No said.
[00:42:06.152 --> 00:42:12.378]  Leaders with the Shelby County Health Department say this is not necessary because it's a very low-risk situation for students.
[00:42:13.019 --> 00:42:16.222]  Still, family members tell me they don't want their kids in school.
[00:42:16.242 --> 00:42:17.443]  It's messed up.
[00:42:17.763 --> 00:42:18.884]  The flu killed them all.
[00:42:18.944 --> 00:42:19.865]  Folks are dead.
[00:42:19.905 --> 00:42:20.886]  So, what's up?
[00:42:21.247 --> 00:42:21.767]  We're gonna die.
[00:42:23.362 --> 00:42:26.023]  So this is the hysteria, and we can laugh at it all day.
[00:42:26.063 --> 00:42:27.804]  It's going to get a lot worse, folks, so get ready.
[00:42:27.844 --> 00:42:30.144]  But no, spread the word it's man-made.
[00:42:30.444 --> 00:42:32.065]  Spread the word the Chai Com's launched it.
[00:42:32.105 --> 00:42:33.305]  Spread the word the left loves it.
[00:42:34.546 --> 00:42:36.707]  All right, we have a surprise guest in studio.
[00:42:36.967 --> 00:42:39.567]  Gary Haven just met with the governor about an hour ago.
[00:42:39.587 --> 00:42:43.409]  And so he's got information from Greg Abbott on coronavirus.
[00:42:43.469 --> 00:42:45.109]  I wanted to make sure he got here before I did this.
[00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:46.470]  He'll be joining us.
[00:42:46.490 --> 00:42:47.990]  There's just stuff going on behind the scenes.
[00:42:49.131 --> 00:42:52.572]  But before we go to break and come back with Gary Haven here in studio,
[00:42:54.212 --> 00:43:03.456]  The coronavirus is a man-made bioweapon launched by the shy comms of the deep state and now the left's openly saying, bring down America, using it, bring down Trump.
[00:43:04.236 --> 00:43:05.757]  We predicted this six weeks ago.
[00:43:05.897 --> 00:43:06.978]  It's now completely clear.
[00:43:07.158 --> 00:43:09.139]  It's outrageous the crimes they're committing.
[00:43:09.799 --> 00:43:15.541]  The evidence shows the virus kills infirm and sick people at about 2%, so it's really bad if you're old or sick.
[00:43:16.682 --> 00:43:23.485]  The evidence shows, though, that we don't know how many healthy people have been contracted because they're not getting sick from it.
[00:43:24.431 --> 00:43:25.372]  And that's coming out.
[00:43:26.232 --> 00:43:29.975]  But regardless, you always need to boost your immune system.
[00:43:30.675 --> 00:43:42.923]  And just as important as having storable food and a firearm to protect yourself, is taking natural concentrates of what's already amazing that God gave us through Mother Nature for your body.
[00:43:43.483 --> 00:43:46.766]  Now let me just give you a real quick example of this so you have a solution here.
[00:43:47.506 --> 00:43:53.010]  Vazobeats is concentrated, one of the strongest concentrates of
[00:43:54.144 --> 00:43:55.525]  We're good to go.
[00:44:22.549 --> 00:44:28.895]  So, whatever you do, get some Beats, or get the Concentrate Vasil Beats, now back in stock, 40% off.
[00:44:28.915 --> 00:44:30.977]  And then it just goes on from there.
[00:44:31.297 --> 00:44:42.908]  When I talk about NanoSilver, and now we have the top NanoSilver company that has over-the-counter confirmed stuff in major stores and is sold in hospitals, we private label it and get an even better deal on it.
[00:44:43.709 --> 00:44:48.134]  They only authorized us, even though they've had this for 13 years, to put this out a few months ago.
[00:44:48.174 --> 00:44:48.754]  Look at this right here.
[00:44:49.035 --> 00:44:53.099]  Texas A&M University Health Center, Office of Homeland Security.
[00:44:53.419 --> 00:45:01.147]  What they found with this nano silver, it's been approved over the counter, we have in our silver cream and our toothpaste.
[00:45:01.527 --> 00:45:03.690]  Now the wound gel is super strong, you don't ingest that.
[00:45:04.090 --> 00:45:06.673]  Department of the Army headquarters, what they found in their test,
[00:45:07.756 --> 00:45:10.080]  And then our authorization to put this out to you.
[00:45:10.701 --> 00:45:12.324]  Because that's the reality, folks.
[00:45:12.364 --> 00:45:20.079]  And the idea that all these publications and things don't want you to know that no, silver is not a panacea.
[00:45:24.753 --> 00:45:27.476]  Nanosilver and silver has been known for thousands of years.
[00:45:27.516 --> 00:45:28.758]  The Egyptians talked about it, everybody did.
[00:45:28.958 --> 00:45:29.879]  And now we know why.
[00:45:29.899 --> 00:45:32.882]  Because it goes in and just fries viruses, fries bacteria.
[00:45:33.603 --> 00:45:36.186]  That doesn't mean you still can't get something and die from it.
[00:45:36.727 --> 00:45:39.990]  No drug, no supplement, no anything is perfect.
[00:45:40.591 --> 00:45:41.792]  Except oxygen and water.
[00:45:41.812 --> 00:45:42.713]  You don't have that, you're dead.
[00:45:43.374 --> 00:45:46.098]  And I'm sure the FDA will come out and say, no, you don't need oxygen, you don't need water.
[00:45:46.118 --> 00:45:50.042]  But being serious here, folks, these are the products we've been selling for years.
[00:45:50.383 --> 00:45:59.354]  We didn't just come up here and start selling vitamin D3 of a super high quality type, saying you need it in the winter, because when you don't get sun, you don't produce it, so you take it out of the tongue.
[00:45:59.594 --> 00:46:00.394]  That's a great product.
[00:46:00.434 --> 00:46:01.494]  My kids take it, I take it.
[00:46:01.835 --> 00:46:03.355]  And it makes us healthier, more vibrant.
[00:46:04.155 --> 00:46:09.316]  All the studies on high quality pure iodine, just type in iodine immunity, iodine coronavirus.
[00:46:09.376 --> 00:46:10.116]  Look it up for yourself.
[00:46:10.376 --> 00:46:12.237]  We have the highest quality iodine, X2 and X3.
[00:46:12.617 --> 00:46:20.999]  And contrary to what the Democrats and George Soros, you know, run Media Matters and all of them say, we have lowered prices during this crisis, not raised them.
[00:46:21.539 --> 00:46:35.090]  So get all your nano silver products, get your X2, get your X3, get your DNA Force Plus, get your nano silver toothpaste, your simple toothpaste that has that and the tea tree and the iodine, all of it 40 to 50% off right now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:38.953]  And I've just decided during this crisis to go ahead and just do this for the next week.
[00:46:39.954 --> 00:46:41.295]  I'm going to call the crew right now.
[00:46:41.335 --> 00:46:45.819]  I'm going to say free shipping store wide is implemented again right now.
[00:46:45.919 --> 00:46:46.459]  Stay with us.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.121]  Gary Haven is coming in hot.
[00:46:49.882 --> 00:46:51.023]  InfoWars.com.
[00:46:57.543 --> 00:46:58.784]  I don't want to interrupt, then I'm leaving.
[00:47:00.085 --> 00:47:01.066]  You've been doing great, Owen.
[00:47:01.126 --> 00:47:03.348]  You're going to finish up with these calls within Gregory's.
[00:47:03.728 --> 00:47:06.811]  And, of course, Harris and Smith are going to take another hour of calls.
[00:47:06.831 --> 00:47:08.152]  The crew's volunteered to do it.
[00:47:08.432 --> 00:47:11.495]  So we're here live covering this, hoping everything de-escalates.
[00:47:11.855 --> 00:47:13.076]  So the live coverage continues.
[00:47:13.116 --> 00:47:14.177]  Everybody spread those links.
[00:47:14.457 --> 00:47:16.779]  The Globals are hacking us, trying to shut this down.
[00:47:16.839 --> 00:47:17.419]  Don't let them win.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:18.180]  No BS.
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.082]  Let me tell you, everything's straight shooting here.
[00:47:20.282 --> 00:47:22.043]  See, I don't have some Machiavelli manipulative view.
[00:47:22.744 --> 00:47:24.926]  With me, it's all straightforward attack.
[00:47:24.986 --> 00:47:26.107]  That's the real power!
[00:47:27.233 --> 00:47:29.477]  Don't act so surprised, Globalist.
[00:47:30.338 --> 00:47:33.543]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[00:47:34.144 --> 00:47:37.509]  Join Bandot Video, and I will complete your training.
[00:47:38.090 --> 00:47:41.996]  Together, we can overthrow the Emperor and restore the Republic.
[00:47:50.057 --> 00:47:56.320]  A biological attack has been launched by the Chi-Coms with a man-made weapon transferred to them by Obama on record five years ago.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:48:01.502]  The media is now saying it's all Trump's fault for the civil unrest they planned to begin.
[00:48:03.163 --> 00:48:17.749]  Now, Gary Haben is a billionaire, smart guy, great pilot, has a lot of courage, flies our crews into places like Haiti right after hurricanes, and I've been begging him to come on for a year, and he wouldn't do it, but then we got a call.
[00:48:19.258 --> 00:48:19.458]  I don't
[00:48:38.916 --> 00:48:40.997]  So you're going to be here until about 15 after next hour.
[00:48:41.017 --> 00:48:41.757]  You've got a lot to say.
[00:48:42.017 --> 00:48:43.037]  But Gary, you're looking good.
[00:48:43.077 --> 00:48:43.577]  Good to see you.
[00:48:43.597 --> 00:48:44.878]  I'm not going to go over your whole bio.
[00:48:44.898 --> 00:48:45.338]  Folks know you.
[00:48:45.458 --> 00:48:45.718]  That's right.
[00:48:45.738 --> 00:48:46.598]  We can't shake hands now.
[00:48:46.978 --> 00:48:47.298]  That's right.
[00:48:47.358 --> 00:48:47.938]  Elbow bump.
[00:48:47.958 --> 00:48:49.379]  We do corona shake.
[00:48:49.399 --> 00:48:50.259]  The corona shake.
[00:48:50.299 --> 00:48:51.539]  So you've got the floor here.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.620]  But tell us what the governor had to say.
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:54.720]  You just met with him a little while ago.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:55.240]  OK.
[00:48:58.183 --> 00:49:01.466]  Actually, a lot of it is going to be in confidence.
[00:49:01.526 --> 00:49:07.250]  I can't reveal everything he had to say, but I do have a lot to say around that conversation.
[00:49:09.452 --> 00:49:20.240]  This coronavirus thing is coming, and we have a really good picture of what America is going to look like in three weeks in Italy.
[00:49:21.218 --> 00:49:34.111]  And we have a chance to proactively take those experiences, whether it's from Italy or South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, and do some things proactively to get ahead of this.
[00:49:35.592 --> 00:49:43.059]  The advice I gave the governor today was that, and this is a quote from the governor of Washington State,
[00:49:44.144 --> 00:49:52.528]  We have a chance to look at what's coming as opposed to what we have right now.
[00:49:53.429 --> 00:49:55.370]  And we've not done a very good job of that.
[00:49:55.390 --> 00:49:56.430]  In fact, you know what?
[00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:57.351]  I love the president.
[00:49:57.371 --> 00:50:06.115]  In fact, I was supposed to meet with him on Friday and I canceled my time at Mar-a-Lago on Friday because there was going to be a gathering of 500 people.
[00:50:07.605 --> 00:50:14.032]  And I thought I was going to have a chance to talk to the President about his very, very poor advice that he's been giving and getting from the CDC.
[00:50:14.753 --> 00:50:28.207]  But you know, when I watched him on television Friday at the CDC, and he said that eventually this is going to go away, I realized that he wasn't going to listen to me in a three-minute elevator speech.
[00:50:29.768 --> 00:50:31.008]  So what can we do?
[00:50:31.088 --> 00:50:34.869]  What can we learn from our experiences with what's going on out there in the world?
[00:50:35.469 --> 00:50:37.530]  Well, first of all, we have to come to terms with the reality.
[00:50:38.210 --> 00:50:38.810]  This is coming.
[00:50:41.571 --> 00:50:43.191]  It is not stoppable.
[00:50:45.072 --> 00:50:58.535]  An epidemiologist from Harvard came out last week and he said, look, because of this being contagious asymptomatically, 40 to 70 percent of Americans are going to get this thing.
[00:50:59.349 --> 00:51:03.990]  Now, the good news is that 85% of the cases are mild.
[00:51:04.310 --> 00:51:13.533]  The problem is 15% of half the American population having complications and even deaths from this thing.
[00:51:16.154 --> 00:51:17.294]  Very, very serious.
[00:51:17.934 --> 00:51:25.676]  And we have a chance right now to do something to prevent deaths and the disaster that's going to happen to our healthcare system.
[00:51:25.696 --> 00:51:27.557]  By the way, I have a little background.
[00:51:28.476 --> 00:51:30.797]  You know, I have a degree in health and nutrition.
[00:51:30.837 --> 00:51:32.438]  I've written two New York Times bestsellers.
[00:51:33.419 --> 00:51:40.303]  I'm working with Baylor College of Medicine, new breakthrough on immunotherapy for cancer.
[00:51:40.343 --> 00:51:43.865]  So I've been spending a lot of time with PhDs in microbiology.
[00:51:44.845 --> 00:51:50.948]  One of my best friends is in charge of employee health at the Cleveland Clinic organization.
[00:51:51.469 --> 00:51:55.771]  His job as a physician is to oversee the health care of 65,000 employees.
[00:51:57.725 --> 00:52:01.809]  I was in a meeting with him a week and a half ago and then on the phone with him Saturday.
[00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:05.532]  We have three vulnerable populations.
[00:52:06.052 --> 00:52:06.933]  We have the elderly.
[00:52:07.934 --> 00:52:10.196]  Death rate for people that are 80 or older is 15%.
[00:52:10.236 --> 00:52:10.616]  70 to 80 is 7.5%.
[00:52:10.656 --> 00:52:11.097]  60 to 70 is about 4%.
[00:52:18.759 --> 00:52:27.973]  People with preconditions, heart disease, COPD, these sorts of things, are the second vulnerable population.
[00:52:28.894 --> 00:52:33.761]  And the third vulnerable population are our first responders in the medical community.
[00:52:34.702 --> 00:52:42.845]  We're getting advice from the CDC that this N95 mask should be worn by all the physicians.
[00:52:43.005 --> 00:52:45.646]  By the way, not by people, but by the physicians.
[00:52:46.547 --> 00:52:53.309]  And that mask has a filtration system of only four microns, where the virus is one micron.
[00:52:53.789 --> 00:52:57.911]  So the CDC is actually giving terrible advice to the medical community.
[00:52:58.531 --> 00:53:00.252]  And Harry, that's because they're setting
[00:53:01.192 --> 00:53:04.893]  The president's up, and we said this six weeks ago, and now we see it.
[00:53:04.973 --> 00:53:06.093]  CNN's like cheering.
[00:53:06.213 --> 00:53:07.553]  Oh, we're going to destroy America.
[00:53:07.894 --> 00:53:08.874]  It's all going to go to hell.
[00:53:09.174 --> 00:53:10.994]  Trump's mismanagement will drive him from office.
[00:53:11.034 --> 00:53:15.015]  The talking point's there, and I think Trump's finally figuring that out, but it's so obvious.
[00:53:15.355 --> 00:53:16.536]  Man-made virus from China.
[00:53:17.036 --> 00:53:18.056]  Everybody praises China.
[00:53:18.076 --> 00:53:19.136]  Everybody attacks America.
[00:53:19.216 --> 00:53:22.457]  He needs to get on the offense and stop kissing Xi Jinping's ass.
[00:53:23.197 --> 00:53:24.878]  No, I don't disagree with that, Alex.
[00:53:25.319 --> 00:53:30.402]  You know, where I disagree with you, okay, is this is a real event that's coming.
[00:53:30.683 --> 00:53:33.705]  You made the statement yesterday that 10,000 people might die from it.
[00:53:36.387 --> 00:53:38.669]  Yes, they're setting the president up for failure.
[00:53:38.709 --> 00:53:44.333]  In fact, I spent a half hour on the phone with the co-chairman of the Republican National Committee yesterday.
[00:53:44.913 --> 00:53:49.917]  Pleading with him to get the president to realize what's really happening.
[00:53:50.237 --> 00:53:54.281]  And I told him, I told him, this is the vice, the co-chair of the Republican Party.
[00:53:54.961 --> 00:54:02.207]  And I said, if you can't get to the president and immediately get him to come to terms with the reality, the presidency is lost.
[00:54:02.587 --> 00:54:08.172]  And of course, worse than that, tens of thousands of Americans... Gary, Gary, Gary, I only throw out devil's advocates.
[00:54:08.812 --> 00:54:10.593]  And I always do wide-spectrum analysis.
[00:54:10.613 --> 00:54:12.494]  I say it could be not a problem, it could be a problem.
[00:54:12.935 --> 00:54:14.896]  And then everybody like always gets mad at me.
[00:54:15.236 --> 00:54:15.957]  That's what I do.
[00:54:16.037 --> 00:54:17.137]  I try to look at every scenario.
[00:54:17.758 --> 00:54:19.319]  Obviously, this is the perfect storm.
[00:54:19.639 --> 00:54:20.940]  This is the weapon that's had got Trump.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:21.520]  We saw that.
[00:54:21.540 --> 00:54:22.160]  They're saying it.
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:22.981]  They're salivating.
[00:54:23.401 --> 00:54:25.623]  He has to now overreact to cut them off at the pass.
[00:54:26.303 --> 00:54:26.803]  I agree.
[00:54:26.863 --> 00:54:27.924]  And I think that's the case.
[00:54:28.624 --> 00:54:35.246]  I just, with the listeners, I can only tell them, I've looked at the numbers, if people show up in Italy and 5% die, that's already the super sick.
[00:54:35.386 --> 00:54:35.846]  I don't think it's 5%.
[00:54:35.886 --> 00:54:37.667]  1% is huge.
[00:54:37.967 --> 00:54:39.067]  I agree the virus is deadly.
[00:54:39.327 --> 00:54:39.487]  Yeah.
[00:54:39.807 --> 00:54:41.668]  I'm saying it's the globalist attack.
[00:54:42.028 --> 00:54:43.488]  We need to make that the main news item.
[00:54:44.509 --> 00:54:45.209]  That's all I'm saying.
[00:54:45.229 --> 00:54:46.269]  You're going to have the floor here.
[00:54:46.289 --> 00:54:47.670]  Owen Schwarz is going to take over.
[00:54:47.710 --> 00:54:48.970]  I've got all these assaults going on.
[00:54:49.010 --> 00:54:49.710]  I've got to take care of it.
[00:54:49.970 --> 00:54:52.051]  Really appreciate the crew and all the audience for the great job.
[00:54:52.071 --> 00:54:54.752]  But listeners, you need to understand, it is
[00:54:56.423 --> 00:54:56.883]  Critical.
[00:54:57.464 --> 00:55:08.931]  It is mission number one that however you can, via word of mouth, Twitter, Facebook, email, text message, that we're on air giving real analysis months ahead of what's happening.
[00:55:08.951 --> 00:55:09.732]  We've proven that.
[00:55:10.272 --> 00:55:14.275]  And we're still not sure at the end of what's happening, but this is the big one.
[00:55:14.595 --> 00:55:15.996]  The Chai comms are salivating.
[00:55:16.256 --> 00:55:17.557]  The globalists are salivating.
[00:55:17.877 --> 00:55:20.959]  They are saying, we just played the clip last hour, this will bring down Trump.
[00:55:21.279 --> 00:55:24.702]  So the president absolutely has to get ahead of this now.
[00:55:25.262 --> 00:55:26.082]  Judiciously.
[00:55:26.542 --> 00:55:28.963]  And the stock market's down 1,300 points right now.
[00:55:29.403 --> 00:55:30.784]  Every day it's dropping 1,000 points.
[00:55:30.884 --> 00:55:32.664]  This is the attack.
[00:55:33.105 --> 00:55:34.025]  This is their weapon.
[00:55:34.405 --> 00:55:35.465]  Everything else failed.
[00:55:35.525 --> 00:55:39.987]  And all the globalists, like Merkel and the rest of them, are hyping it as much as possible.
[00:55:40.027 --> 00:55:42.227]  So Gary Haben, I totally agree with you.
[00:55:42.768 --> 00:55:44.248]  And I was just hearing your meeting with the governor.
[00:55:44.268 --> 00:55:44.948]  You want to come in?
[00:55:44.968 --> 00:55:47.889]  You'll never come on the show, so I knew you had some big stuff.
[00:55:47.909 --> 00:55:49.310]  They didn't tell me you don't see your meeting with the governor.
[00:55:49.350 --> 00:55:49.850]  Was that a secret?
[00:55:51.011 --> 00:55:52.132]  Um, no, not really.
[00:55:52.232 --> 00:55:52.992]  Okay, well, I told him.
[00:55:53.012 --> 00:55:53.573]  Is that secret?
[00:55:53.613 --> 00:55:54.213]  No, he's coming on.
[00:55:54.233 --> 00:55:54.773]  I met with the governor.
[00:55:55.013 --> 00:55:56.334]  So I wanted to hear that stuff.
[00:55:56.354 --> 00:55:59.596]  I don't think with Abbott, personally, so Abbott thinks this is a big deal, right?
[00:55:59.836 --> 00:55:59.996]  Yes.
[00:56:00.456 --> 00:56:03.618]  Okay, so you're going to take over with Owen Troyer on the other side.
[00:56:03.658 --> 00:56:05.879]  I'm going to go deal with all the assaults they've got going on right now.
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:07.580]  But I really appreciate you coming in.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:08.181]  Good to see you, man.
[00:56:08.901 --> 00:56:09.281]  That's right.
[00:56:09.301 --> 00:56:10.342]  We don't shake hands anymore.
[00:56:10.442 --> 00:56:11.563]  That's right.
[00:56:11.583 --> 00:56:15.585]  I went to CPAC, and now they're talking about quarantining the president.
[00:56:15.985 --> 00:56:16.165]  Yeah.
[00:56:16.905 --> 00:56:17.686]  Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:56:17.706 --> 00:56:18.326]  You feeling okay?
[00:56:18.827 --> 00:56:19.587]  I'm feeling damn good.
[00:56:20.785 --> 00:56:21.325]  Are you kidding?
[00:56:21.345 --> 00:56:22.825]  The worst stuff gets the better I feel.
[00:56:22.865 --> 00:56:24.966]  I'm like a pig and you know what.
[00:56:25.406 --> 00:56:26.546]  Alright, great job to the crew.
[00:56:26.626 --> 00:56:28.487]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[00:56:28.527 --> 00:56:30.367]  Gary Haven, Owen Schroer, take it over.
[00:56:30.407 --> 00:56:35.748]  And if you want alarmist views, you got Mike Adams hosting coming up for an hour and 45 minutes.
[00:56:35.768 --> 00:56:37.768]  He comes in 15 minutes to the next hour.
[00:56:37.969 --> 00:56:38.949]  And I think Mike's a good guy.
[00:56:38.969 --> 00:56:39.549]  I respect Mike.
[00:56:39.569 --> 00:56:41.309]  So, you want Mike Adams, you got him.
[00:56:41.749 --> 00:56:49.371]  Ladies and gentlemen, Gary Haven is in studio and I'm telling you, the reason why I love Gary is because he cares about people.
[00:56:50.287 --> 00:56:56.190]  So in the break, he's like, oh, and I got to tell people about what they can do right now with this coronavirus outbreak.
[00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:58.171]  So he's chomping at the bit to get that out.
[00:56:58.291 --> 00:57:06.695]  But before we do that, Alex just took off and he's telling me, he's like, hey, we got the vaso beats back in stock.
[00:57:07.555 --> 00:57:11.377]  Make sure you tell everybody about nitric oxide, its role in immunity.
[00:57:12.517 --> 00:57:17.400]  And I'm just kind of sitting here like, wow, you know, look at all this documentation we have on
[00:57:19.542 --> 00:57:26.084]  Vasobeads, or at least the elements inside of it, the nitric oxide and other things, and its role in immunity.
[00:57:26.104 --> 00:57:27.704]  I'm thinking, I don't even need this.
[00:57:27.884 --> 00:57:30.445]  I found out about this years ago.
[00:57:30.825 --> 00:57:32.605]  I found out about the nitric oxide.
[00:57:33.505 --> 00:57:35.306]  I found out about the power of beads.
[00:57:35.366 --> 00:57:39.347]  It's become a major top-selling supplement for almost five years now.
[00:57:40.907 --> 00:57:44.868]  And so there's no doubt to me, I don't need these documents here.
[00:57:47.093 --> 00:57:47.393]  Telling
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:09.240]  I think so.
[00:58:29.941 --> 00:58:30.742]  Totally pure.
[00:58:30.902 --> 00:58:31.683]  You're going to love it.
[00:58:31.723 --> 00:58:32.924]  You will see the benefits.
[00:58:32.944 --> 00:58:33.824]  Good for your heart health.
[00:58:34.185 --> 00:58:35.746]  But don't take my word for it.
[00:58:36.127 --> 00:58:37.848]  You can go read all the documents for yourself.
[00:58:37.928 --> 00:58:39.229]  It's at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:58:39.630 --> 00:58:41.151]  VasoBeat Complete.
[00:58:41.851 --> 00:58:44.774]  Now, Gary, we're talking about supplements.
[00:58:44.794 --> 00:58:48.037]  You know, I was thinking about this because I take probably like, I don't know, 20 pills a day.
[00:58:48.257 --> 00:58:53.462]  And that's just the supplements I feel like I need to help me be at peak operating, you know, abilities.
[00:58:54.585 --> 00:58:59.430]  You look at somebody like Ray Kurzweil who wants to live forever, wants to bring his dad back from the dead.
[00:58:59.571 --> 00:59:02.674]  This is a guy who worked at Google, may still in the AI department.
[00:59:03.475 --> 00:59:05.998]  I think the last time I saw he takes like 90 pills a day.
[00:59:06.639 --> 00:59:10.823]  So these are the guys who want to live forever and they're taking 90 supplements a day because it's
[00:59:11.704 --> 00:59:13.665]  It's like the secret science almost.
[00:59:13.725 --> 00:59:18.188]  It's like it's so obvious and with our diets that are so malnourished and everything.
[00:59:18.729 --> 00:59:24.453]  But you're talking about specifically dealing with coronavirus or disease outbreak like this.
[00:59:24.853 --> 00:59:36.801]  What people can do, what they need to have in their shelves, and what they need to start taking as part of a supplement routine or a diet to make sure they can be as healthy and strong in the immune system as possible.
[00:59:37.081 --> 00:59:37.441]  That's right.
[00:59:38.522 --> 00:59:40.143]  You know, I have a degree in nutrition.
[00:59:40.203 --> 00:59:43.504]  I've written two New York Times bestsellers on women's health.
[00:59:45.084 --> 00:59:50.446]  There's a supplementation regimen that you can take that's antiviral.
[00:59:50.926 --> 00:59:52.486]  It's also anti-inflammatory.
[00:59:52.506 --> 00:59:56.068]  So you guys may want to get a pencil and write this down.
[00:59:56.128 --> 00:59:59.889]  It's simply four things and they can all be purchased here at InfoWars.
[01:00:00.749 --> 01:00:09.416]  The first thing is we need to be on a dose of vitamin C of at least 4,000 milligrams a day.
[01:00:09.456 --> 01:00:12.058]  You want to split that up because it's a water-soluble vitamin.
[01:00:12.878 --> 01:00:18.763]  Number two, we need to be on 4,000 IUs of vitamin D3.
[01:00:19.924 --> 01:00:24.287]  Number three, we need to be on about 400 milligrams of magnesium.
[01:00:25.248 --> 01:00:27.750]  And then the final one is about 50 milligrams of zinc.
[01:00:28.746 --> 01:00:29.226]  I don't
[01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:52.299]  And I believe this to be very effective.
[01:00:52.859 --> 01:01:01.441]  I and all my family members and as many people as I can tell, you know, in my meeting with the governor today, I meant to bring him a supply of it.
[01:01:02.801 --> 01:01:04.581]  But I did remember to bring you guys cigars.
[01:01:05.021 --> 01:01:07.462]  Well, so you prioritized what you're saying.
[01:01:07.782 --> 01:01:10.283]  The cigars made it, the supplement routine didn't.
[01:01:10.423 --> 01:01:12.063]  Well, we do have our priorities, right?
[01:01:13.214 --> 01:01:16.897]  Let me get this straight, though, because I did take notes.
[01:01:16.917 --> 01:01:21.420]  4,000 milligrams a day of vitamin C. Yes.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.781]  4,000 IUs of vitamin D3 a day.
[01:01:24.042 --> 01:01:24.222]  Yes.
[01:01:24.362 --> 01:01:26.183]  Which can also come from the sun, correct?
[01:01:26.703 --> 01:01:31.647]  Yeah, but we just don't get enough sun, especially coming out of the winter.
[01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:32.868]  Well, we're in winter right now.
[01:01:33.328 --> 01:01:39.332]  By the way, that's one of the reasons the flu season happens, because we don't have enough vitamin D in our body, because we lack sunlight.
[01:01:39.372 --> 01:01:39.733]  But go ahead.
[01:01:42.034 --> 01:01:43.495]  4,000 milligrams a day magnesium.
[01:01:44.255 --> 01:01:44.755]  No, 400.
[01:01:45.135 --> 01:01:44.755]  400.
[01:01:45.835 --> 01:01:50.577]  See, this is why, folks, you take notes and then you go back and check, okay?
[01:01:50.937 --> 01:01:53.057]  And then 50 milligrams a day of zinc.
[01:01:53.457 --> 01:01:53.737]  Correct.
[01:01:54.498 --> 01:02:08.642]  Now, I double-check for brevity here, but I'm pretty sure just from the supplements that I take from InfoWare store alone, which probably makes up about 70% of the supplements I take, I would guess I'm getting all these a day.
[01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:09.942]  Probably more.
[01:02:11.156 --> 01:02:11.557]  I don't
[01:02:30.274 --> 01:02:36.639]  How lacking they are in basic vitamins and minerals that are just saturated from the diet.
[01:02:36.679 --> 01:02:41.463]  The new industrial farming, everything they do with pesticides, all the preservatives.
[01:02:41.963 --> 01:02:46.587]  So you may be eating three meals a day, but you might not be getting all the vitamins and minerals.
[01:02:46.607 --> 01:02:47.387]  So you're getting sick.
[01:02:47.427 --> 01:02:48.528]  You don't know what's going on.
[01:02:49.049 --> 01:02:50.610]  This is commonplace in society.
[01:02:50.670 --> 01:02:51.451]  Nobody talks about it.
[01:02:52.091 --> 01:02:59.654]  Yeah, you know, I'm a farmer and rancher, and we put three nutrients back into the soil.
[01:02:59.674 --> 01:03:03.855]  It's called MPK fertilization, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
[01:03:04.816 --> 01:03:10.438]  The soil has long ago been depleted from trace minerals and even major minerals.
[01:03:11.278 --> 01:03:12.879]  So, it ain't there.
[01:03:13.620 --> 01:03:18.444]  So, you're either going to suffer the consequences of not having any of your diet, or you can supplement.
[01:03:18.804 --> 01:03:19.905]  And supplementing is pretty easy.
[01:03:20.305 --> 01:03:29.472]  You know what, I would suggest that you guys put together an immuno pack with these four nutrients in it, so that people know exactly what to order when they
[01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:34.575]  Let's do it right now live, because I bet I could guess where they can get all these things.
[01:03:34.875 --> 01:03:37.056]  I would guess we have 4,000 milligrams.
[01:03:37.157 --> 01:03:39.338]  Guys, pull up Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:03:39.418 --> 01:03:41.039]  We'll see if we can do this in 60 seconds.
[01:03:41.059 --> 01:03:42.499]  We're testing the crew right now.
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.661]  All right, the crew is on, you know, we're on the ship in the ocean.
[01:03:45.701 --> 01:03:47.422]  The hurricane winds are coming in.
[01:03:47.742 --> 01:03:48.622]  The tide is strong.
[01:03:49.003 --> 01:03:50.283]  All right, there's Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:03:50.303 --> 01:03:53.165]  Let's see if you're getting 4,000 milligrams a day from this, guys.
[01:03:53.185 --> 01:03:54.185]  You should be able to scroll down.
[01:03:54.245 --> 01:03:54.646]  We have the
[01:03:55.586 --> 01:03:56.726]  Yes, there it is.
[01:03:57.467 --> 01:03:58.647]  We have all the facts about this.
[01:03:58.667 --> 01:04:04.169]  I would actually just go, guys go up to the, oh there is zinc in there too, and magnesium.
[01:04:04.189 --> 01:04:08.591]  Guys go up to, no keep going up, go to the picture of the, there we go.
[01:04:08.671 --> 01:04:10.192]  Let's see if we can zoom in on this.
[01:04:13.273 --> 01:04:15.914]  Vitamin C, you're getting a thousand there.
[01:04:16.194 --> 01:04:19.415]  Okay, so you need a little bit more, you can get a little bit more in your diet.
[01:04:19.575 --> 01:04:21.516]  Yeah, how many servings a day do you take of this?
[01:04:22.535 --> 01:04:23.057]  Uh, one.
[01:04:23.077 --> 01:04:23.878]  Okay.
[01:04:23.898 --> 01:04:24.800]  This is one serving.
[01:04:25.041 --> 01:04:26.444]  Thousand IU vitamin D.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:29.161]  So you're at least chipping away.
[01:04:29.241 --> 01:04:30.082]  Magnesium.
[01:04:30.563 --> 01:04:31.864]  Where's magnesium on there?
[01:04:32.084 --> 01:04:33.145]  I know it's in there somewhere.
[01:04:33.165 --> 01:04:35.687]  Magnesium is at the top right.
[01:04:35.887 --> 01:04:36.467]  25 milligrams.
[01:04:36.688 --> 01:04:40.251]  Okay, so you're chipping away and then zinc is in there too.
[01:04:40.571 --> 01:04:41.031]  5 milligrams.
[01:04:41.071 --> 01:04:42.492]  So it's just a good way to start your day.
[01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:43.874]  This is just one supplement, by the way.
[01:04:43.914 --> 01:04:46.916]  This is just the powder that I start my day with every day.
[01:04:47.056 --> 01:04:50.079]  So you're getting a good start with Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:51.860]  So I bet we can complete this list.
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.042]  I mean, we have the Winter Sun Vitamin D. I know that.
[01:04:54.062 --> 01:04:54.763]  Alright, we're going to break.
[01:04:54.783 --> 01:04:55.363]  We'll be right back.
[01:04:55.383 --> 01:04:56.324]  Gary Haven on the other side.
[01:04:58.012 --> 01:04:59.613]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:04:59.733 --> 01:05:02.014]  Owen Schroer, Gary Haven with you.
[01:05:02.034 --> 01:05:12.801]  And we're talking about how you can prepare yourself for any virus, but with the coronavirus outbreaking, obviously this is one way to build your immune system.
[01:05:12.841 --> 01:05:20.846]  We covered that last segment, but we're having very serious discussions now about the coronavirus, where it comes from, what it is, what its purpose was.
[01:05:21.767 --> 01:05:26.990]  And I'll just kind of lay out my basic where I'm at right now, Gary, and then we can get into everything we were talking about.
[01:05:29.548 --> 01:05:41.416]  And I was saying this in the break is, I think we need to be focused more, because I'm not necessarily as worried about the viral outbreak as maybe you or others, for reasons that you'll get into here, that I agree with.
[01:05:42.256 --> 01:05:45.478]  I'm more worried about figuring out how it started and why.
[01:05:45.498 --> 01:05:55.685]  Because it's, right, this thing comes out of nowhere, we have the Indian doctor examine it, says, oh look, this has been designed, it's been spliced with HIV and other things.
[01:05:56.565 --> 01:05:58.466]  Then we have all the cover-up coming out of China.
[01:05:58.526 --> 01:06:02.048]  We have all the cover-up on social media of that exact story.
[01:06:02.388 --> 01:06:02.828]  Censoring.
[01:06:03.028 --> 01:06:06.810]  And so that always raises red flags to me, has me asking questions.
[01:06:07.090 --> 01:06:08.310]  We're not focusing on that.
[01:06:08.530 --> 01:06:12.192]  Now we're looking at, hey, do we need to be freaked out about this?
[01:06:12.532 --> 01:06:13.713]  How should we be stopping this?
[01:06:13.733 --> 01:06:15.534]  Which is all fair and good.
[01:06:16.374 --> 01:06:24.460]  But if we don't really get down to the bottom of it, how can we properly, you know, analyze or project how we need to prepare, what we need to prepare for?
[01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:30.564]  So you were getting into, though, what you think is going on, which I won't agree or disagree.
[01:06:30.684 --> 01:06:33.265]  I'm kind of still like open-minded, like anything can happen.
[01:06:33.686 --> 01:06:36.307]  But I think we both agree this was a bioweapon.
[01:06:36.328 --> 01:06:36.788]  Yes.
[01:06:37.688 --> 01:06:42.672]  You're leaning more towards this was something aimed at the Chinese people.
[01:06:43.581 --> 01:06:47.324]  Yes, with Americans as collateral damage.
[01:06:48.465 --> 01:06:53.749]  And where do you think this originated, or what do you think spurred this to happen?
[01:06:55.370 --> 01:07:00.794]  Well, we know that China is a threat to American hegemony.
[01:07:02.255 --> 01:07:11.923]  And, you know, the popular idea is that this virus escaped from a Level 4 bioweapons lab in Wuhan.
[01:07:13.746 --> 01:07:18.249]  But I believe, I hate to admit this, I believe in something much more nefarious.
[01:07:19.730 --> 01:07:25.513]  I think the deep staters, the powers that be in our country, and I think I know how they did it.
[01:07:26.294 --> 01:07:30.116]  A lot of people have been reading this, even though it's not very common yet.
[01:07:31.497 --> 01:07:38.621]  The world military exercises were held in Wuhan in October, 14 days after they left.
[01:07:38.641 --> 01:07:41.243]  And by the way, there were 300 American soldiers participating.
[01:07:42.442 --> 01:07:48.266]  Two weeks after they left, which happens to be the average incubation period, this virus turned up in Wuhan.
[01:07:49.146 --> 01:08:00.993]  You know, Owen, we know that it's a weaponized virus because we see the RNA strands that were put into this virus from HIV, from MERS, and from the SARS virus.
[01:08:01.033 --> 01:08:02.694]  There's no way this could have happened in nature.
[01:08:02.714 --> 01:08:03.695]  So somebody built it.
[01:08:03.715 --> 01:08:04.875]  There's no question about that.
[01:08:04.895 --> 01:08:09.118]  The question is who did, and who unleashed this on the world?
[01:08:10.094 --> 01:08:22.144]  I'm afraid the powers that be in this country who want to destroy Trump's presidency, they want to eliminate China's threat to our hegemony.
[01:08:23.044 --> 01:08:27.608]  And by the way, there's a byproduct of this, which is a depopulation effort.
[01:08:31.035 --> 01:08:38.419]  You know, providing some solution to our social security elderly problem.
[01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:47.765]  This sounds terrible, but this collateral damage to the American people, I believe, was a desirable byproduct for the people that are in power.
[01:08:48.685 --> 01:08:50.907]  So the question is, for all of us,
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:09:00.085]  I think once we embrace that it's a bioweapon and not from nature, which, by the way, is contradicting what the CDC is telling us.
[01:09:00.326 --> 01:09:02.127]  Well, it's just tough for people to accept that.
[01:09:02.187 --> 01:09:03.007]  I mean, let's be honest.
[01:09:03.047 --> 01:09:04.688]  Most people are living in la-la land.
[01:09:04.728 --> 01:09:09.251]  They're trying to figure out what Tom Brady is going to have for breakfast or where he's going to, you know, throw a football.
[01:09:09.692 --> 01:09:12.714]  So when you talk about a bioweapon, you know, they can barely even comprehend it.
[01:09:12.734 --> 01:09:15.635]  They just immediately throw you out as some conspiracy coup.
[01:09:15.675 --> 01:09:16.996]  No, this is very real stuff.
[01:09:17.156 --> 01:09:17.857]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:09:18.291 --> 01:09:22.195]  Yeah, you know, I have nothing to gain by being here and putting myself out there.
[01:09:22.216 --> 01:09:24.018]  You know, I've got a pretty good life, right?
[01:09:25.539 --> 01:09:28.062]  But I think truth is a powerful thing.
[01:09:28.543 --> 01:09:35.531]  We certainly aren't getting it from the mainstream media and we aren't getting it from alternative media except for you guys and a few other sources.
[01:09:37.772 --> 01:09:43.655]  And what is getting out there is being censored, which by the way is an indicator that we may be pretty close to the truth.
[01:09:44.476 --> 01:09:54.380]  So we got to embrace the idea that, and we know this, the laboratory in India who ended up being censored, you know, they did the RNA analysis of this thing.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.161]  It's a bioweapon.
[01:09:55.901 --> 01:09:56.722]  You can't get around that.
[01:09:56.742 --> 01:10:03.325]  And it's important to acknowledge that because it's very, very difficult to develop a vaccine for a bioweapon.
[01:10:04.125 --> 01:10:08.248]  So, we gotta come to terms with the reality whether we're comfortable with it or not.
[01:10:08.989 --> 01:10:10.630]  And then, what do you do with the information?
[01:10:11.111 --> 01:10:12.812]  Well, I'm trying to get to Trump.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:19.543]  To make him aware that this is not a non-event.
[01:10:20.303 --> 01:10:23.045]  This is a very nefarious act against him.
[01:10:23.445 --> 01:10:25.246]  He's following the lead of the CDC.
[01:10:25.486 --> 01:10:28.007]  You know, yesterday the president said, I'm a fan of his, right?
[01:10:28.027 --> 01:10:29.928]  I was supposed to see him on Friday night.
[01:10:32.049 --> 01:10:34.210]  He said that this will go away.
[01:10:34.230 --> 01:10:35.571]  That's a quote.
[01:10:36.846 --> 01:10:44.447]  Because he believes that the CDC is what they're telling him, which is that very few people are going to get this.
[01:10:45.408 --> 01:10:48.248]  85% have very mild symptoms.
[01:10:48.768 --> 01:10:57.530]  And by the way, the reason I know the president believes them is he is still out shaking hands and putting himself in a public situation and exposing himself to this.
[01:10:57.850 --> 01:11:02.291]  And by the way, what is the role of the lady that was Rosenstein's sister at the CDC?
[01:11:03.334 --> 01:11:07.816]  I'm sure it's just one that we were just able to identify easily because there was a relation there.
[01:11:07.956 --> 01:11:08.196]  Yeah.
[01:11:08.216 --> 01:11:15.119]  Well, the crew can find it, but go on how Trump is going along with what the CDC is saying.
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:15.700]  Yeah.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:20.642]  And again, that's why I'm sitting here just kind of like, I don't want to, it's not even a hedging my bet.
[01:11:20.702 --> 01:11:26.445]  I'm just not even ready to throw chips in the pot here because as we already know, this virus
[01:11:27.518 --> 01:11:27.598]  It's
[01:11:47.626 --> 01:11:50.869]  Then that's like a major indicator of what we're dealing with.
[01:11:51.049 --> 01:11:52.830]  Yeah, let me explain that to the audience.
[01:11:53.931 --> 01:12:01.397]  You know, we know that Harvard got into a lot of trouble with the Chinese government because they were over there sampling the DNA of thousands of Chinese people.
[01:12:02.739 --> 01:12:06.141]  The receptor site in the human body is primarily in the lungs.
[01:12:12.426 --> 01:12:13.326]  You said it in the break.
[01:12:13.466 --> 01:12:14.627]  Yeah, I said it in the break.
[01:12:15.687 --> 01:12:16.648]  It'll pop up in a second.
[01:12:16.668 --> 01:12:28.432]  The receptor site where this virus connects and infects people is, with Asians, has a 4.0 level in their body.
[01:12:28.772 --> 01:12:30.513]  The ACE2 receptor sites.
[01:12:30.593 --> 01:12:30.933]  There we go.
[01:12:32.439 --> 01:12:36.880]  With European people like us, it's 0.47.
[01:12:38.181 --> 01:12:39.441]  And with Africans, it's 0.40.
[01:12:39.701 --> 01:12:42.342]  There's a very mild outbreak in Africa.
[01:12:42.362 --> 01:12:47.703]  And I believe it's partly because this virus was designed to kill primarily Asian people.
[01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:53.345]  Now, the problem is it's going to kill a lot of Europeans and non-Asian people because it's still lethal.
[01:12:54.405 --> 01:12:58.870]  But that's one more evidence that it was designed as a bioweapon to attack China.
[01:12:59.651 --> 01:13:14.066]  And you know now I'm thinking about something that I thought I remember because it's breaking out in Italy and if I remember correctly actually this could be something else that I'm remembering in my mind but I think there's similar DNA with Italians and Asians like there's some
[01:13:15.267 --> 01:13:18.469]  There's some connection there in the genealogy history.
[01:13:18.629 --> 01:13:22.692]  I'm not sure about that, but let's talk about Italy for a moment.
[01:13:23.233 --> 01:13:26.735]  Italy is... Maybe I'm just thinking about Italians invading a different country.
[01:13:26.755 --> 01:13:27.816]  I think that's what I'm thinking of now.
[01:13:27.896 --> 01:13:28.537]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:13:29.017 --> 01:13:32.019]  Well, Italy is America in three weeks.
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:35.382]  And in my meeting with the governor, I shared this with him.
[01:13:35.982 --> 01:13:42.347]  We can look at Italy today, and that's our future in three weeks, and the yesterday
[01:13:43.067 --> 01:13:49.031]  The infected rate in Italy was 10,100 some odd cases and the death rate was 463.
[01:13:49.251 --> 01:13:52.013]  That's a 5% death rate.
[01:13:53.554 --> 01:13:57.297]  The hospital system in Italy is absolutely overrun.
[01:13:57.937 --> 01:14:04.202]  They are as rapidly as they can converting regular hospital rooms into ICU.
[01:14:04.222 --> 01:14:08.545]  Hold that thought because we got to go to a break and let's just close off with this segment because
[01:14:09.898 --> 01:14:26.049]  Based on the knowledge that we've talked about here today, if the outbreak in China on the timescale with what we've seen it go like this, and then we've seen it in Italy go like this, you're saying America is basically the two weeks, three weeks away from what happened in China, then what happened in Italy, is going to be here.
[01:14:26.069 --> 01:14:27.390]  All right, we'll be right back with Gary Haven.
[01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.870]  Don't go anywhere.
[01:14:29.431 --> 01:14:32.514]  And I'll be back today hosting The War Room at 3 p.m.
[01:14:32.554 --> 01:14:32.894]  Central.
[01:14:36.004 --> 01:14:39.466]  Unfortunately, my guest slate is so booked, I don't even have time for Gary Haven.
[01:14:39.526 --> 01:14:41.908]  How can I not preempt a guest for Gary Haven?
[01:14:41.928 --> 01:14:43.509]  He's going to beat me up in the break, guys.
[01:14:43.689 --> 01:14:44.590]  My feelings are hurt.
[01:14:45.571 --> 01:14:51.895]  We did the Corona elbow when we came in for a greeting, but he may go just no holds barred.
[01:14:51.915 --> 01:14:53.296]  He may just pummel me in the break.
[01:14:53.417 --> 01:14:54.958]  So I might not even be able to host at three.
[01:14:54.998 --> 01:14:55.778]  Gary may pummel me.
[01:14:56.099 --> 01:14:56.719]  I may be out.
[01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.921]  It's always fun to talk with Gary Haven.
[01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:02.784]  Very serious, sobering subject today, though.
[01:15:03.755 --> 01:15:14.862]  And we're just talking in the break, and it just goes down perfectly with the questions I wanted to ask you, because I wanted to get into what do we do next when it comes to this, because this is something I think, you know, anybody who's seriously thinking about this is considering.
[01:15:15.562 --> 01:15:18.844]  Lockdowns, travel restrictions, self-quarantines.
[01:15:18.864 --> 01:15:22.066]  These are things we're already seeing worldwide and now happening in America.
[01:15:23.066 --> 01:15:24.227]  So I want to get your thoughts.
[01:15:24.987 --> 01:15:30.431]  What do you think about a lockdown, which I kind of already know, so I'm going to kind of give you a couple other leaning questions.
[01:15:31.271 --> 01:15:32.492]  What do you think we need to do with travel?
[01:15:33.809 --> 01:15:42.395]  And basically what we were saying is, or what you were saying is, you think we need to do what Italy is doing now, but now, before it reaches that point, so you can get into that.
[01:15:42.955 --> 01:15:48.839]  But my question is, because I think that this is really where I think the discussion needs to be had.
[01:15:50.220 --> 01:15:51.081]  How do you do that?
[01:15:51.821 --> 01:15:53.803]  How do you do that to the American people?
[01:15:53.923 --> 01:15:56.865]  How do you successfully pull that off without causing panic?
[01:15:56.905 --> 01:16:01.768]  How do you do that without having it labeled martial law, saying Trump brought in martial law?
[01:16:03.956 --> 01:16:06.450]  Do you have any fears that
[01:16:07.728 --> 01:16:17.652]  This could lead to some new, kind of like 9-11 changed the world, some new internet era where people are so afraid to even leave their front doors, you don't even have human-to-human contact anymore.
[01:16:17.672 --> 01:16:24.755]  You stay inside, you're connecting on the internet, the real world is basically done because of this coronavirus outbreak causing so much fear and panic.
[01:16:25.155 --> 01:16:28.176]  Gary Haven, try to just address all that.
[01:16:28.456 --> 01:16:28.796]  Okay.
[01:16:30.137 --> 01:16:31.717]  That was a nice, easy question, Owen.
[01:16:31.737 --> 01:16:32.278]  I appreciate it.
[01:16:32.298 --> 01:16:35.319]  I know, you should be able to just think freely and, you know.
[01:16:36.239 --> 01:16:36.640]  Okay, good.
[01:16:36.660 --> 01:16:37.461]  I appreciate that.
[01:16:38.382 --> 01:16:51.015]  You know what we know from the experiences in Italy or South Korea is that there's two things that have reduced both the death rate and the contagion rate of the coronavirus.
[01:16:51.095 --> 01:16:52.117]  Number one is testing.
[01:16:53.243 --> 01:16:54.504]  I don't know.
[01:17:09.329 --> 01:17:15.575]  And as a result, we'd only tested 1,753 people through Sunday in all of America, which is nuts.
[01:17:16.156 --> 01:17:21.481]  In South Korea, they're testing thousands and thousands a day, even through drive-through.
[01:17:22.122 --> 01:17:29.209]  So if we don't know who's got it, we can't separate them from the people that are prone to be infected.
[01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:32.212]  Then the second thing that we've got to do is quarantine.
[01:17:34.148 --> 01:17:40.735]  I quoted the governor of Washington a minute ago and he said, look, we're going to be looking at what's coming, not where we're at today.
[01:17:42.867 --> 01:17:44.048]  Quarantining can be done.
[01:17:45.309 --> 01:17:46.730]  In fact, I'll tell you what I told the governor.
[01:17:46.750 --> 01:17:53.014]  I said, look, on Monday, you need to ask people voluntarily to stop gathering.
[01:17:54.595 --> 01:17:56.436]  Church services shouldn't be going on.
[01:17:57.417 --> 01:17:59.478]  The Houston rodeo shouldn't be on.
[01:17:59.518 --> 01:18:01.500]  You guys canceled the South by Southwest.
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:03.661]  None of this should be happening right now.
[01:18:03.741 --> 01:18:07.164]  Nobody should be getting together in groups of people in close quarters.
[01:18:08.544 --> 01:18:12.485]  I said he should recommend the schools to close.
[01:18:13.185 --> 01:18:14.786]  University of Texas is closed today.
[01:18:14.806 --> 01:18:15.786]  That's a great start.
[01:18:16.306 --> 01:18:21.068]  But a leader needs to be standing in front of the population making these recommendations.
[01:18:21.528 --> 01:18:25.249]  They shouldn't be coming up with them on their own as good ideas.
[01:18:26.209 --> 01:18:32.391]  And by the way, I told the governor that make it voluntary now that people are taking these precautions.
[01:18:33.462 --> 01:18:39.008]  Uh, to get them ready for what you're gonna have to do in about three weeks, which is make it mandatory.
[01:18:39.108 --> 01:18:45.735]  I hate to cut you off, it's just I have to because this is the issue that we run into, philosophically and even just physically.
[01:18:45.755 --> 01:18:46.155]  Yeah.
[01:18:46.596 --> 01:18:48.938]  How do you do that without causing a panic?
[01:18:49.198 --> 01:18:52.161]  How do you do that without having the backdrop of saying, look,
[01:18:52.882 --> 01:18:54.164]  This is why we have to do this.
[01:18:54.625 --> 01:18:55.787]  This was a bioweapon, folks.
[01:18:55.807 --> 01:18:56.829]  This is a serious deal.
[01:18:57.109 --> 01:18:58.131]  We don't know what's going on.
[01:18:58.171 --> 01:18:59.193]  We've got to get to the bottom of it.
[01:18:59.614 --> 01:19:00.736]  This is going to cause panic.
[01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:02.338]  It's going to lead to martial law.
[01:19:02.739 --> 01:19:04.883]  How do you weigh which is the right move to make?
[01:19:07.082 --> 01:19:11.868]  Yeah, you know, and I actually had that discussion with the governor, because, you know, he's trying to find the right spot.
[01:19:12.850 --> 01:19:17.516]  First of all, the way the federal government is doing it right now is wrong, and I'll tell you why.
[01:19:18.276 --> 01:19:23.924]  They believe that information and panic is one point on a spectrum, and it's not.
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:33.144]  You can begin to give people information so they can make informed decisions before you get to the point on the spectrum where they panic.
[01:19:33.624 --> 01:19:36.066]  And we're not on that point.
[01:19:36.186 --> 01:19:40.048]  In fact, the CDC is actually lying by omission.
[01:19:41.468 --> 01:19:42.609]  They are telling people
[01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:49.591]  You know, last week, when we had 10 infections, or 12, or 50, or 62, and then it got to 323.
[01:19:49.971 --> 01:19:53.331]  When they make that announcement, they fail to give the disclaimer.
[01:19:53.351 --> 01:19:56.372]  The disclaimer is, oh, but we haven't tested anybody.
[01:19:56.392 --> 01:19:58.253]  You know, they tested 1,500 people by Sunday.
[01:19:58.753 --> 01:20:01.834]  Without giving you that disclaimer, they are lying by omission.
[01:20:02.354 --> 01:20:06.055]  That is a terrible way to approach this, and it's going to kill a lot of people.
[01:20:06.095 --> 01:20:11.636]  So my point is, let's get on that spectrum somewhere between information and panic.
[01:20:12.376 --> 01:20:18.701]  And not lie to the people, nor not tell them things because we're afraid of panic.
[01:20:19.862 --> 01:20:26.026]  What do you think, let's make this personal, not to make it about me because other people are facing the same thing.
[01:20:27.707 --> 01:20:29.229]  Should I get on a plane this weekend?
[01:20:29.529 --> 01:20:29.649]  No.
[01:20:31.584 --> 01:20:32.525]  I was afraid you'd say that.
[01:20:32.645 --> 01:20:33.005]  Absolutely.
[01:20:33.025 --> 01:20:36.047]  You know, I'm an airline-rated transport pilot.
[01:20:36.947 --> 01:20:41.410]  The filtration system on an airplane does absolutely no good.
[01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:46.052]  And you guys got to remember, this is an airborne virus.
[01:20:46.433 --> 01:20:48.674]  And even the CDC has been holding back on that.
[01:20:48.794 --> 01:20:49.534]  It's airborne.
[01:20:50.155 --> 01:20:50.815]  I'll give you proof.
[01:20:51.556 --> 01:20:54.177]  That cruise ship that was anchored off of Yokohama
[01:20:55.618 --> 01:20:57.739]  When it was quarantined, it had 10 cases.
[01:20:57.759 --> 01:21:01.702]  14 days later, there were 700 cases.
[01:21:02.323 --> 01:21:06.585]  And these were people that were isolated in their cabins and not allowed to leave.
[01:21:06.645 --> 01:21:07.226]  But guess what?
[01:21:07.906 --> 01:21:10.368]  They were all breathing the same circulated air.
[01:21:11.008 --> 01:21:17.033]  If you get on an airplane, not just with one person happens to have it, and you're breathing this airborne virus,
[01:21:17.953 --> 01:21:22.496]  Even when that person gets off the plane, it has infected the filtration system.
[01:21:23.236 --> 01:21:31.061]  And everybody that gets on that plane for the rest of the day, and they only clean these planes one time a day, but even that doesn't matter because they don't clean the filtration system.
[01:21:31.701 --> 01:21:36.224]  Do not get on a commercial airliner, and for heaven's sake, don't get on a cruise ship.
[01:21:36.364 --> 01:21:38.625]  Do we have access to this data yet?
[01:21:38.925 --> 01:21:39.726]  Do you know, Gary?
[01:21:39.766 --> 01:21:40.426]  Do we have access?
[01:21:40.466 --> 01:21:43.228]  Have they actually said, okay, here's somebody that was on this plane,
[01:21:43.928 --> 01:21:45.450]  Let's test everybody on this plane.
[01:21:45.570 --> 01:21:47.112]  OK, here's how it went down.
[01:21:47.452 --> 01:21:48.253]  Here's everybody who was on.
[01:21:48.674 --> 01:21:55.322]  I mean, I'm kind of on the opposite side of the spectrum, like I'm like 50 50, but like just on the side of I don't want lockdown.
[01:21:55.362 --> 01:21:56.964]  I don't I still want to fly, you know, whatever.
[01:21:56.984 --> 01:21:57.985]  I still want to take a vacation.
[01:21:58.366 --> 01:21:59.787]  You're on the no total lockdown.
[01:22:00.689 --> 01:22:00.829]  But.
[01:22:02.532 --> 01:22:08.437]  Even I see them docking a ship in California and releasing everyone on the ship.
[01:22:08.477 --> 01:22:13.562]  And I'm sitting here like, hey, well, I'm the last guy that wants to panic over this, but that's ridiculous.
[01:22:13.802 --> 01:22:20.968]  How do you not make that like a floating hospital situation and test every single person and don't let them off until they've been tested?
[01:22:21.128 --> 01:22:22.069]  I mean, what is that?
[01:22:23.066 --> 01:22:25.167]  Well, the first problem is the CDC.
[01:22:25.507 --> 01:22:26.527]  So is that the CDC?
[01:22:26.607 --> 01:22:28.608]  Yes, they have not produced the test kits.
[01:22:29.288 --> 01:22:33.169]  Now, they allegedly came out with 75,000 test kits on Monday.
[01:22:33.569 --> 01:22:35.589]  Yeah, Trump said he's about to release a million.
[01:22:36.130 --> 01:22:39.431]  And perhaps they're going to do a million, but they're not out there yet.
[01:22:39.851 --> 01:22:42.371]  Doctors, I'm talking to my physician friends, they're not able to get it.
[01:22:43.012 --> 01:22:45.852]  Part of the strategy of the CDC practice is this.
[01:22:46.532 --> 01:22:47.933]  Don't test, don't tell.
[01:22:49.093 --> 01:22:49.553]  And guess what?
[01:22:50.674 --> 01:23:00.820]  The Communist Chinese, they ran out of test kits, and so they started claiming victims of pneumonia rather than coronavirus.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:03.101]  That's why you can't believe any of the numbers in China.
[01:23:03.122 --> 01:23:06.964]  So our government has practiced don't test, don't tell.
[01:23:09.056 --> 01:23:12.317]  That's why we don't know how many people own airplanes or anything else.
[01:23:12.337 --> 01:23:13.958]  But isn't that like criminal negligence?
[01:23:14.018 --> 01:23:15.038]  Yes it is.
[01:23:15.858 --> 01:23:24.801]  See, and that's the kind of stuff that I'm sitting here thinking, and this is when you get real conspiratorial, and it's almost like you can't even believe your own conspiracy theory that there would be that many people involved.
[01:23:25.161 --> 01:23:29.163]  But I mean, it's like, are they intentionally letting people off that boat so they can spread it?
[01:23:29.223 --> 01:23:29.803]  I mean, that's like...
[01:23:31.448 --> 01:23:33.472]  I just can't even believe that they would let that happen.
[01:23:34.053 --> 01:23:43.389]  Well, the other argument to that is that any government agency, any bureaucrat, bureaucracy, is going to be absolutely incompetent and inept.
[01:23:44.002 --> 01:23:49.825]  You know, in a bureaucratic culture... I completely agree.
[01:23:49.885 --> 01:23:52.567]  It's just funny because it is like matter-of-fact.
[01:23:52.747 --> 01:23:53.988]  Yeah, like a government bureaucracy?
[01:23:54.008 --> 01:23:54.508]  Yeah, it sucks.
[01:23:54.988 --> 01:24:02.693]  Yeah, you know, any bureaucracy culture, any member of it, is not going to put their job at risk.
[01:24:02.913 --> 01:24:04.294]  It's all about job preservation.
[01:24:04.694 --> 01:24:10.618]  So no one's going to stand up and say, hey look, this is coming, because they put not only themselves at risk for being wrong,
[01:24:11.278 --> 01:24:11.598]  Are you
[01:24:27.487 --> 01:24:32.089]  You know, hopefully that's all it is, but I'm with you on this one.
[01:24:32.129 --> 01:24:33.249]  I think it's more nefarious.
[01:24:33.789 --> 01:24:36.990]  I mean, that is, again, I'm the last guy saying panic.
[01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:38.091]  I'm not worried about the virus.
[01:24:38.111 --> 01:24:39.691]  Like, that's where I stand right now.
[01:24:40.171 --> 01:24:46.713]  And I'm sitting here like, wait, you're docking the ship and releasing them and you're not even going to test this as like a, it's a perfect test case.
[01:24:46.933 --> 01:24:48.274]  It's literally formulaic.
[01:24:48.554 --> 01:24:49.134]  We'll be right back.
[01:24:51.328 --> 01:24:52.889]  Mike Adams is about to be joining us.
[01:24:53.289 --> 01:24:54.489]  Gary Haven is going to stick around.
[01:24:54.530 --> 01:24:56.951]  It's going to be an incredible hour of radio the next hour.
[01:24:56.991 --> 01:24:58.011]  You're not going to want to miss this.
[01:24:58.972 --> 01:25:01.713]  But let me finish up with Gary here before Mike takes over.
[01:25:02.868 --> 01:25:09.494]  Okay, what do you think we need to do, again, what do you think we need to do as a society to avoid a horrible breakout?
[01:25:09.554 --> 01:25:11.596]  And then what do you think individuals need to do?
[01:25:12.076 --> 01:25:14.058]  Like, I'm about to fight Gary now.
[01:25:14.298 --> 01:25:20.183]  At the beginning he was going to fight me, now I'm going to be fighting him because he's basically like, no, you can't travel, you've got to cancel these trips.
[01:25:20.843 --> 01:25:22.985]  And I'm probably now going to have to do it, which sucks.
[01:25:23.586 --> 01:25:26.148]  But what do you think individuals, what do you think we all need to do?
[01:25:26.388 --> 01:25:29.429]  I think Mike in a minute here, Mike Adams, is going to agree with me.
[01:25:29.769 --> 01:25:30.629]  We'll get Mike in a minute.
[01:25:30.669 --> 01:25:31.850]  He can hold me too.
[01:25:31.890 --> 01:25:33.190]  You're not going to be traveling anywhere.
[01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:35.471]  I'll work both of your heads together.
[01:25:36.691 --> 01:25:44.794]  So the quick answer on what we should do, and I shared this with the governor today, we need to start doing massive testing so we know who's got it.
[01:25:45.294 --> 01:25:46.715]  And number two, we need to quarantine.
[01:25:47.435 --> 01:25:49.095]  And so those are the two big factors.
[01:25:49.115 --> 01:25:50.216]  Now what do we do personally?
[01:25:50.836 --> 01:25:57.217]  You know, Owen and I were talking about how the American people are likely collateral damage from a bioweapons attack.
[01:25:57.737 --> 01:25:59.458]  How do you not be collateral damage?
[01:25:59.978 --> 01:26:03.919]  Well, first of all, you need to figure out how to quarantine yourself.
[01:26:03.979 --> 01:26:05.959]  You need to stay out of the way of groups of people.
[01:26:07.619 --> 01:26:10.240]  Second, you need to supplement.
[01:26:10.280 --> 01:26:16.461]  You know, I mentioned earlier this immune therapy supplementation, and I want to repeat it again.
[01:26:17.061 --> 01:26:18.342]  It's 2,000, or excuse me, 4,000 IUs
[01:26:20.542 --> 01:26:28.349]  Vitamin D3, 4,000 milligrams of vitamin C, 400 milligrams of magnesium, and 50 of zinc.
[01:26:28.769 --> 01:26:32.832]  You need to get yourself on that, your family members, immediately.
[01:26:33.613 --> 01:26:38.056]  The other things you can do is do not get into public transportation.
[01:26:38.397 --> 01:26:39.397]  Don't get on an airplane.
[01:26:39.758 --> 01:26:49.546]  You're literally getting into a capsule where you're trapped with the very likelihood of this virus, this airborne virus, floating around and you're going to be breathing it.
[01:26:50.126 --> 01:26:55.268]  We would know right now how dangerous that is if the CDC had done their testing.
[01:26:55.768 --> 01:26:57.929]  So don't test, don't tell.
[01:26:58.449 --> 01:27:01.771]  They're putting all of us at risk for those kinds of environments.
[01:27:02.191 --> 01:27:03.892]  No public transportation.
[01:27:04.732 --> 01:27:06.393]  If you can work from home, you want to do it.
[01:27:06.473 --> 01:27:09.134]  We should be closing the schools down, the colleges down.
[01:27:09.794 --> 01:27:14.976]  That quarantine should be happening immediately, at least voluntarily, led by the governor.
[01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:17.978]  But it's going to be mandatory in about three weeks.
[01:27:18.319 --> 01:27:19.900]  So why don't you get ahead of this?
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:22.182]  Why don't you get out of the way of that train?
[01:27:22.782 --> 01:27:25.865]  Then the final thing I want to mention on this, and it's very, very important.
[01:27:26.525 --> 01:27:32.971]  The medical community and the first responders, these guys do not have the right equipment.
[01:27:33.091 --> 01:27:37.414]  They're being advised by the CDC to wear N95 masks and goggles.
[01:27:37.915 --> 01:27:42.618]  That is not what it takes to protect yourself from an airborne virus.
[01:27:43.439 --> 01:27:45.080]  So we've got to get smart.
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:51.162]  We've got to set up a triage so that nobody with these symptoms can go into a hospital or into a clinic.
[01:27:51.742 --> 01:27:55.924]  The triage has to be equipped by people with the right equipment in a negative air environment.
[01:27:56.524 --> 01:28:00.586]  We need to make sure that nobody goes to see their doctor with upper respiratory infections.
[01:28:00.666 --> 01:28:04.527]  It all should be done telecommunically.
[01:28:04.747 --> 01:28:08.429]  We've got to examine people over the telephone.
[01:28:10.949 --> 01:28:15.931]  And we've got to be prepared because our hospitals are going to be overrun.
[01:28:16.071 --> 01:28:23.172]  And they're literally, in Italy today, they don't have enough ventilators, so they're having to choose who lives or dies.
[01:28:24.253 --> 01:28:27.113]  Which is what comes with socialist healthcare.
[01:28:27.413 --> 01:28:28.654]  It's called a death panel.
[01:28:29.454 --> 01:28:30.354]  Yeah, but guess what?
[01:28:30.854 --> 01:28:33.135]  We're going to have a death panel here in America.
[01:28:34.125 --> 01:28:35.766]  In five or six weeks.
[01:28:49.415 --> 01:28:52.677]  I could see a lesser person thinking they were going to die and probably have to go to the hospital.
[01:28:52.697 --> 01:28:56.159]  I mean, I couldn't, like getting out of bed to go to the bathroom was like torture.
[01:28:57.899 --> 01:29:01.901]  But my point is, I was never worried about it because I know I had a strong immune system.
[01:29:01.921 --> 01:29:02.962]  And that's part of my problem, too.
[01:29:03.002 --> 01:29:05.243]  I was saying, too, like, oh, you can get on an airplane, Schroyer.
[01:29:05.543 --> 01:29:06.204]  You can go to court.
[01:29:06.304 --> 01:29:06.744]  No problem.
[01:29:06.764 --> 01:29:08.705]  That's just always my mentality, no matter what.
[01:29:08.745 --> 01:29:10.586]  It's like a ballplayer with like a busted ankle.
[01:29:10.606 --> 01:29:11.686]  It's like, no, you can get through it.
[01:29:11.706 --> 01:29:12.467]  You know, the adrenaline.
[01:29:13.197 --> 01:29:15.561]  I got to stick around here, at least for one segment.
[01:29:15.581 --> 01:29:17.724]  This is going to be way too powerful with Mike Adams coming up.
[01:29:18.004 --> 01:29:28.460]  Because I want to ask Mike too, how do we properly manage this glass menagerie without causing total panic in society and martial law?
[01:29:29.713 --> 01:29:30.754]  No time for a liner.
[01:29:30.794 --> 01:29:32.255]  This information is too powerful.
[01:29:32.335 --> 01:29:36.037]  You know, Gary told me last night, he's like, Owen, you can't travel.
[01:29:36.077 --> 01:29:40.720]  And I was slamming my hands on the desk like, this is like the fourth vacation in a row I've had to cancel.
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:41.640]  I can't get a trip.
[01:29:42.201 --> 01:29:43.141]  But leave it to Gary.
[01:29:43.321 --> 01:29:46.063]  He says, hey, I got a house you can use and there's a beach next to it.
[01:29:46.303 --> 01:29:48.165]  So Gary, Gary saves the day.
[01:29:49.126 --> 01:29:52.328]  But getting serious here, because I'm probably going to have to cancel these trips.
[01:29:52.609 --> 01:29:53.089]  I really am.
[01:29:53.129 --> 01:29:53.790]  I can't believe it.
[01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:54.370]  It sucks.
[01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:56.612]  It's just like my fourth vacation I've had to cancel in a row.
[01:29:56.652 --> 01:29:57.493]  I can't get away from this.
[01:29:58.474 --> 01:30:00.716]  But that's where this has gotten now.
[01:30:00.756 --> 01:30:02.097]  That's how serious this has gotten.
[01:30:02.717 --> 01:30:08.202]  And Gary, to me, laid out the perfect point, which is when you get on these airplanes, the ventilation system isn't good enough.
[01:30:08.222 --> 01:30:09.023]  But I'll confirm it.
[01:30:09.463 --> 01:30:11.124]  Let's see what Mike Adams thinks.
[01:30:11.184 --> 01:30:14.767]  Just briefly, Mike, before I get into the topics I want to have you two discuss here.
[01:30:15.568 --> 01:30:17.409]  Should I travel?
[01:30:17.429 --> 01:30:18.290]  And it's not just me.
[01:30:18.310 --> 01:30:19.931]  This is anybody listening that has a trip planned.
[01:30:19.951 --> 01:30:21.593]  I'm just using myself as an example here.
[01:30:22.153 --> 01:30:26.436]  Mike, should I get on an airplane and take a trip or should I cancel it all right now?
[01:30:27.117 --> 01:30:31.020]  Owen, you should cancel immediately and Gary Haven is 100% correct.
[01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:32.041]  No question about it.
[01:30:32.691 --> 01:30:38.654]  Well, I was afraid you were going to say that, but I'm going to unfortunately have to trust your guys' opinions and not leave this to risk.
[01:30:39.714 --> 01:30:41.655]  I need a mic.
[01:30:42.256 --> 01:30:42.856]  A couple of things.
[01:30:44.357 --> 01:30:45.797]  Two things I really like about Gary.
[01:30:46.117 --> 01:30:47.718]  Number one, Gary is highly intelligent.
[01:30:48.078 --> 01:30:52.600]  You don't get to be very successful in the business world unless you can anticipate future events.
[01:30:53.101 --> 01:30:55.302]  So when Gary does a business deal, he might earn
[01:30:55.982 --> 01:30:57.823]  I don't know, $200 million on a business deal.
[01:30:58.123 --> 01:30:58.703]  How do you do that?
[01:30:59.003 --> 01:30:59.943]  Not by being stupid.
[01:31:00.263 --> 01:31:01.304]  You have to anticipate.
[01:31:01.364 --> 01:31:02.144]  He's very good at that.
[01:31:02.264 --> 01:31:04.805]  Secondly, Gary's not afraid to tell you when you're wrong.
[01:31:05.325 --> 01:31:08.806]  And he does that to me, and you, and Alex, and everybody.
[01:31:09.126 --> 01:31:14.467]  Gary will just tell you exactly what he's calculated, and he's telling you information that I absolutely agree with.
[01:31:14.888 --> 01:31:15.708]  You should not fly.
[01:31:16.108 --> 01:31:16.828]  No one should fly.
[01:31:17.208 --> 01:31:19.509]  No one in the country should be flying right now, today.
[01:31:20.208 --> 01:31:21.869]  All right, well let me do this then.
[01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:24.590]  I want to hear both of you guys discuss this.
[01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:31.273]  Because like I said, I've been on the 50-50 side, but if I'm falling off the fence, I'm falling on the less precautionary side.
[01:31:31.353 --> 01:31:32.534]  I don't think it's going to be that bad.
[01:31:32.554 --> 01:31:34.715]  I trust my immune system.
[01:31:34.895 --> 01:31:37.516]  But you guys are kind of convincing me to go on to the other side.
[01:31:38.837 --> 01:31:40.137]  So how do you do this though?
[01:31:40.277 --> 01:31:43.539]  How do you properly address this to the nation?
[01:31:43.619 --> 01:31:47.341]  How do you properly lay out a lockdown-type, quarantine-type
[01:31:48.121 --> 01:32:07.574]  I'll even say martial law type situation without causing societal panic, without causing the collapse of civilization, and then without bringing in on the back end a new era of human civilization where you don't even go outside, you don't leave your front door, it's the true internet digital age, everyone's too afraid to go outside.
[01:32:07.634 --> 01:32:08.194]  How do you do this?
[01:32:08.234 --> 01:32:10.095]  Let's go to Mike Adams and then Gary Haven.
[01:32:10.135 --> 01:32:12.217]  Mike, how do you properly do that?
[01:32:13.140 --> 01:32:18.044]  Okay, first answer is we have to stop thinking that fear is bad.
[01:32:18.584 --> 01:32:20.466]  First of all, fear is a survival mechanism.
[01:32:20.806 --> 01:32:23.868]  And the bigger risk right now is not being fearful early enough.
[01:32:24.789 --> 01:32:26.470]  People in Italy said, don't be afraid.
[01:32:26.670 --> 01:32:28.732]  Now their hospitals are completely overrun.
[01:32:28.912 --> 01:32:30.974]  It's an apocalypse there in their medical system.
[01:32:31.274 --> 01:32:32.575]  They locked down the entire country.
[01:32:33.055 --> 01:32:34.497]  Italy is America's future.
[01:32:34.877 --> 01:32:36.299]  Gary was exactly right about that.
[01:32:36.339 --> 01:32:40.804]  We say that Italy is a time machine for America, and the coronavirus is a truth machine.
[01:32:41.185 --> 01:32:43.047]  The truth will come out, you can't cover it up.
[01:32:43.467 --> 01:32:48.654]  You use your fear now to take action, strategic action, so that we don't become the next Italy.
[01:32:48.694 --> 01:32:49.575]  That's my answer, Owen.
[01:32:50.506 --> 01:32:50.986]  Yeah, that's great.
[01:32:51.406 --> 01:33:02.332]  Mike, I've been telling everybody I know to go to nationalnews.com because you have been the most effective leader in getting the truth to the American people.
[01:33:02.913 --> 01:33:10.717]  And I want you to know that in my visit with the governor today, I am so grateful that I had your information to share with the governor.
[01:33:11.457 --> 01:33:22.670]  And I pointed out to him that not only can he proactively begin to protect people in the state, but his leadership will be seen by the governors all over the country and hopefully by the president.
[01:33:23.150 --> 01:33:25.833]  You are an instrumental part of that conversation.
[01:33:26.454 --> 01:33:29.756]  But let me bring up something we all want to also protect, guys, and that's freedom.
[01:33:29.856 --> 01:33:33.178]  I mean, what do you think about the notion, because I'm genuinely afraid of this.
[01:33:33.198 --> 01:33:38.402]  This has been my biggest fear from this coronavirus, more than the virus, and I will still stand firm on this.
[01:33:39.042 --> 01:33:45.507]  I'm afraid that this will be used, like 9-11 was used, to change the face of the world, to change the face of human interaction.
[01:33:45.847 --> 01:33:47.288]  How do we avoid that?
[01:33:48.148 --> 01:33:49.409]  Well, you're not wrong about that, Owen.
[01:33:49.429 --> 01:33:51.351]  That's one of my big concerns as well.
[01:33:51.391 --> 01:33:57.036]  I've got Stuart Rhodes coming on at the bottom of the hour to talk about the constitutional implications of this for civil liberties and much more.
[01:33:57.477 --> 01:34:04.944]  This is a very difficult, you know, threading-the-needle type of exercise here at the state level, with the governor of Texas, as well as with President Trump.
[01:34:05.424 --> 01:34:13.131]  Personally, I think if Trump doesn't start to take immediate, correct actions in the next two to three weeks, I think the Trump administration is over.
[01:34:13.772 --> 01:34:15.874]  And I'll get into more details about that later today.
[01:34:16.274 --> 01:34:18.155]  So Trump could be ended by this.
[01:34:18.315 --> 01:34:22.979]  The Republic could be ended if we don't take very urgent actions right now.
[01:34:23.980 --> 01:34:24.961]  Yeah, Mike, I agree with you.
[01:34:25.301 --> 01:34:29.104]  Only I would be a little more urgent about it.
[01:34:30.345 --> 01:34:36.449]  I was on the phone yesterday for 30 minutes with the co-chairman of the Republican Party, who sees Trump almost every day.
[01:34:37.130 --> 01:34:40.833]  And I was able to wake him up and convince him that this is real.
[01:34:41.855 --> 01:34:46.397]  And he told me, he says, you know, he says, I'm gonna spend the rest of the afternoon studying, I'm gonna sleep on it.
[01:34:47.257 --> 01:34:53.799]  And I said, Tommy, tomorrow morning, you're gonna have, that was this morning, you're gonna have to make a decision.
[01:34:54.959 --> 01:34:56.180]  What do I do with this information?
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:10.745]  I said, if you are fearless about going to the president, convincing him that this is imminent, and to quit listening to this horribly incompetent CDC, not only will you save his presidency, because I think he's got about a week,
[01:35:13.612 --> 01:35:16.678]  And you'll save the lives of possibly millions of Americans.
[01:35:18.382 --> 01:35:22.371]  And I said, buddy, I'm sorry to put that on your plate, but that's where you're going to be tomorrow morning.
[01:35:24.130 --> 01:35:27.532]  Mike, let me ask you the question that I talked to Gary about earlier.
[01:35:28.553 --> 01:35:35.318]  How is it that we have the perfect, it's like a gift given to us with this cruise liner out in the ocean.
[01:35:35.438 --> 01:35:36.619]  It's the perfect opportunity.
[01:35:36.699 --> 01:35:37.960]  It's totally formulaic.
[01:35:38.020 --> 01:35:39.241]  It's totally scientific.
[01:35:39.561 --> 01:35:41.182]  The perfect place for testing grounds.
[01:35:41.502 --> 01:35:42.443]  You test everybody.
[01:35:42.663 --> 01:35:43.564]  You see who's got it.
[01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:44.484]  You see who's don't.
[01:35:44.685 --> 01:35:46.106]  You see how many people got infected.
[01:35:46.146 --> 01:35:46.906]  You see the age.
[01:35:46.926 --> 01:35:47.767]  You see all the stuff.
[01:35:48.207 --> 01:35:50.729]  Then you can dock and release them.
[01:35:51.169 --> 01:35:51.489]  No!
[01:35:51.849 --> 01:35:52.770]  They did none of that.
[01:35:52.810 --> 01:35:57.553]  They brought it right up to the dock and they released them except for like two or three people that they knew had it.
[01:35:57.613 --> 01:36:01.195]  I mean, how is, is that not criminal negligence?
[01:36:01.375 --> 01:36:14.282]  Is that not like, hey, we've got a perfect lab just given to us in an unfortunate situation, but now fortunately we've got this floating hospital, we can test it, keep it safe, and they just like walk in like a bull in a china shop, just smash the whole thing up.
[01:36:14.302 --> 01:36:16.343]  I mean, is that not criminal negligence from the CDC?
[01:36:17.163 --> 01:36:18.764]  It is criminal negligence, but it's beyond that.
[01:36:18.784 --> 01:36:25.408]  I believe this is a deliberate plot to destroy Trump since impeachment failed and the Russia collusion hoax failed.
[01:36:25.448 --> 01:36:37.655]  Gary spoke to this in the last hour that he believes this was released by the deep state to harm China, but also to have blowback onto Trump while the CDC deliberately withheld testing kits from the entire country.
[01:36:37.695 --> 01:36:39.076]  So if you delay this,
[01:36:40.056 --> 01:36:40.897]  Three to four weeks.
[01:36:41.017 --> 01:36:50.925]  What happens if you do the exponential math on this, if it doubles about every 3.5 days, then two people infected at the beginning of the month becomes about 1,024 infected people.
[01:36:51.425 --> 01:36:59.271]  So the CDC was able to multiply this by a factor of roughly about 500 by delaying the testing, and I believe that was deliberate, Owen.
[01:36:59.791 --> 01:37:01.913]  But see, now we've entered a new realm.
[01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:06.528]  What do you do if you're the president to address this?
[01:37:06.808 --> 01:37:11.154]  Because this is something that has, it's like a separate issue but the same issue.
[01:37:12.075 --> 01:37:16.881]  The president needs to come out, and I almost think this would be my political way of attacking this issue.
[01:37:17.322 --> 01:37:18.764]  The president needs to come out and say,
[01:37:20.504 --> 01:37:26.767]  Ever since I started running, there have been a corrupt, criminal, international cabal out to get me.
[01:37:27.407 --> 01:37:29.748]  The latest attempt is releasing this weapon.
[01:37:30.408 --> 01:37:36.451]  And he then needs to use that, you just mentioned as the example, to say, look, they're not giving out the testing kits.
[01:37:36.831 --> 01:37:38.932]  And then you say, look, they fake hate crimes.
[01:37:39.332 --> 01:37:40.532]  Look, they're fake news.
[01:37:40.973 --> 01:37:42.613]  Look, they fake investigations.
[01:37:42.994 --> 01:37:46.775]  Look at what they did in Puerto Rico when they withheld disaster relief aid.
[01:37:46.795 --> 01:37:47.856]  I mean, does it get worse than that?
[01:37:48.036 --> 01:37:48.736]  People dying?
[01:37:49.056 --> 01:37:50.677]  And then they withhold it to make Trump look bad.
[01:37:50.697 --> 01:37:51.957]  They're doing the same thing.
[01:37:52.457 --> 01:37:57.199]  Trump can come out and say, look, this is why we needed to close the borders three years ago to illegals.
[01:37:57.519 --> 01:37:59.140]  This is why globalism doesn't work.
[01:37:59.160 --> 01:37:59.980]  He missed that boat.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.061]  That ship sailed.
[01:38:01.081 --> 01:38:02.241]  He should have done that two weeks ago.
[01:38:02.541 --> 01:38:07.863]  But this proves that Trump's philosophies on globalism versus nationalism are actually correct.
[01:38:07.903 --> 01:38:09.424]  We need more industries here in America.
[01:38:09.844 --> 01:38:13.286]  We need more redundant supply lines in America, and we need to protect our borders.
[01:38:13.586 --> 01:38:19.570]  Trump could be hammering that, and he should be firing the head of the CDC right now today, and laying blame where it belongs.
[01:38:19.610 --> 01:38:24.012]  They set a trap for Trump, and he's caught in it right now, and so far he hasn't been able to get out of it.
[01:38:24.192 --> 01:38:30.336]  Well, not to be dystopic utopian, but in a weird way, like, if we survive this, that's ultimately the answer.
[01:38:30.476 --> 01:38:31.337]  Independence again.
[01:38:32.077 --> 01:38:32.918]  Independence again.
[01:38:32.958 --> 01:38:33.798]  We're not independent.
[01:38:33.898 --> 01:38:34.619]  Independence again.
[01:38:34.899 --> 01:38:35.779]  Final words, Gary Heaven?
[01:38:35.999 --> 01:38:42.543]  Yeah, Owen, as a practical matter, there's no way the president can come out and say this is a deep state plot.
[01:38:43.784 --> 01:38:49.307]  As you know, the media would just tear him alive over that thing.
[01:38:49.908 --> 01:38:56.592]  But what he can do, and what he should do, is focus on the spread of this illness and get in front of it, way in front of it.
[01:38:57.552 --> 01:39:07.015]  And immediately, and I agree with Mike, fire the head of the CDC, quit listening to their horrible advice, and begin to protect the American people from what's coming.
[01:39:07.856 --> 01:39:09.396]  Gary Haven, thank you so much.
[01:39:09.496 --> 01:39:10.056]  Always a pleasure.
[01:39:10.116 --> 01:39:11.577]  Mike Adams takes over.
[01:39:12.657 --> 01:39:16.038]  Look, folks, we've been right ahead of this the whole time.
[01:39:17.319 --> 01:39:22.080]  I just wish we had a lot more political pull, because we'd probably avoid a lot of these messes, man.
[01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:23.781]  It's just, it's time and time again, it's true.
[01:39:25.700 --> 01:39:28.302]  All right, we continue now for the rest of this hour.
[01:39:28.342 --> 01:39:29.082]  I'll be hosting.
[01:39:29.203 --> 01:39:36.328]  We've got Stuart Rhodes from Oath Keepers joining us at the bottom of this hour to talk about, well, martial law.
[01:39:37.293 --> 01:39:40.996]  The quarantine shutdown of entire cities in the United States.
[01:39:41.756 --> 01:39:44.998]  What is the constitutionality of those actions?
[01:39:45.158 --> 01:39:50.021]  Are there things that the president can do that are constitutional that don't violate our civil rights?
[01:39:50.542 --> 01:39:52.743]  Stuart Rhodes will be answering those questions.
[01:39:53.564 --> 01:39:57.887]  I just want to comment before we even get there on Gary Haven being a guest today.
[01:39:58.587 --> 01:39:59.648]  Was fantastic.
[01:40:00.309 --> 01:40:03.592]  Gary, I listened intently to what Gary had to say.
[01:40:03.612 --> 01:40:07.336]  A very interesting banter between Gary Haven and Owen Schroer there.
[01:40:07.816 --> 01:40:09.418]  And then I was able to join that last segment.
[01:40:10.139 --> 01:40:11.240]  Gary is 100% right on.
[01:40:13.702 --> 01:40:15.183]  And Gary absolutely gets it.
[01:40:15.504 --> 01:40:17.125]  He's a very sharp individual.
[01:40:17.205 --> 01:40:20.407]  He can follow the math, you know, more than just follow the math.
[01:40:20.447 --> 01:40:22.208]  I mean, he understands projections, okay?
[01:40:22.649 --> 01:40:31.235]  You don't get to be hugely successful in the business world like he is and to be a pilot of your own fleet of private jets, you know, by being a stupid person.
[01:40:31.495 --> 01:40:32.536]  He is incredibly sharp.
[01:40:32.576 --> 01:40:33.016]  He gets it.
[01:40:33.717 --> 01:40:38.981]  And he has issued a warning today to, in effect, all InfoWars staff.
[01:40:39.461 --> 01:40:40.982]  It's time to stop traveling by air.
[01:40:42.003 --> 01:40:48.708]  And I want to add to that, as of today, I told Alex Jones this morning, he called me about coming on today and hosting.
[01:40:48.728 --> 01:40:52.650]  I told Alex, I'm no longer coming into the InfoWars studio.
[01:40:53.391 --> 01:41:00.215]  So I am from now on, whenever I'm invited, I'll be broadcasting from my studio where I am right now.
[01:41:01.096 --> 01:41:02.237]  We've improved the bandwidth.
[01:41:02.277 --> 01:41:06.279]  We have good audio, thanks to some of the hardware upgrades.
[01:41:06.740 --> 01:41:09.621]  And I want to thank the InfoWars staff for helping to make that happen.
[01:41:09.922 --> 01:41:11.703]  But I will not be coming into the InfoWars studio.
[01:41:12.583 --> 01:41:15.425]  Any longer until this pandemic is over and done with.
[01:41:15.505 --> 01:41:17.907]  So I am self-quarantining in a sense.
[01:41:18.567 --> 01:41:20.528]  I'm no longer going out to eat at restaurants.
[01:41:21.509 --> 01:41:24.050]  And this is not a plot to destroy Trump.
[01:41:24.631 --> 01:41:26.372]  This is common sense.
[01:41:26.492 --> 01:41:29.233]  This is smart, tactical behavior.
[01:41:29.573 --> 01:41:30.434]  I'm a Trump supporter.
[01:41:30.574 --> 01:41:31.755]  I want Trump to survive this.
[01:41:32.195 --> 01:41:33.536]  I want him to stay in office.
[01:41:33.556 --> 01:41:35.277]  I want him to destroy the deep state.
[01:41:36.189 --> 01:41:44.517]  But the Deep State, as Gary Haven described, is using this engineered Global 9-11 type of event to try to destroy Trump.
[01:41:45.458 --> 01:41:46.398]  And they may succeed.
[01:41:46.919 --> 01:41:49.681]  This is the warning that I'm sharing with you here today.
[01:41:50.042 --> 01:41:51.383]  They may succeed.
[01:41:51.723 --> 01:41:52.904]  And I think Gary gets this.
[01:41:53.425 --> 01:41:54.726]  I certainly get this as well.
[01:41:55.026 --> 01:42:00.532]  If Trump does not take decisive action, and we'll talk about what some of that might be, decisive action,
[01:42:01.152 --> 01:42:02.793]  Gary thinks he's got only a week left.
[01:42:02.914 --> 01:42:05.115]  I think Trump maybe might have two weeks.
[01:42:05.696 --> 01:42:07.257]  That might be overly optimistic.
[01:42:07.677 --> 01:42:12.842]  Actually, if you go back to my projections on this, I've been overly optimistic the entire time.
[01:42:12.862 --> 01:42:19.027]  For example, I predicted that this week we would have dozens of cases confirmed in the United States.
[01:42:19.287 --> 01:42:21.169]  But as of last night, we have over a thousand.
[01:42:21.829 --> 01:42:30.478]  So, as much as if you want to say I'm spreading fear, I mean, even this morning Alex Jones said I'm kind of an alarmist.
[01:42:30.799 --> 01:42:34.943]  So, I mean, not that many people have ever been called an alarmist by Alex Jones.
[01:42:35.263 --> 01:42:38.387]  So, but I have been overly optimistic.
[01:42:38.407 --> 01:42:41.090]  In other words, I haven't been alarming enough.
[01:42:42.321 --> 01:42:43.503]  To keep up with the numbers.
[01:42:44.043 --> 01:42:44.644]  You understand?
[01:42:45.025 --> 01:42:50.533]  So, everything that I've told you has been actually better than the best case scenario.
[01:42:50.633 --> 01:42:52.215]  It's way worse than anything I've said.
[01:42:52.836 --> 01:42:53.597]  It's way worse.
[01:42:53.977 --> 01:42:55.720]  That's what the numbers are proving right now.
[01:42:56.281 --> 01:42:57.602]  And yeah, there's been a little bit of a...
[01:42:58.695 --> 01:43:07.719]  There's a little bit of a divergence here on InfoWars, where Alex is maybe kind of downplaying some of the mortality rate a little bit, or at least asking those questions.
[01:43:07.819 --> 01:43:11.820]  Alex likes to explore all the scenarios, and that's great.
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:12.941]  That's what's great about InfoWars.
[01:43:13.001 --> 01:43:15.062]  It's not some rigged, scripted news.
[01:43:15.082 --> 01:43:20.444]  You're going to have guests like myself who believe this is going to be far, far worse than anything.
[01:43:20.644 --> 01:43:22.925]  You might have other guests who say, ah, it's no big deal.
[01:43:23.265 --> 01:43:23.926]  It's just the flu.
[01:43:25.126 --> 01:43:26.868]  That's because InfoWars is real media.
[01:43:27.348 --> 01:43:28.670]  And we don't all agree all the time.
[01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:31.152]  But we do tell you the truth as we see it.
[01:43:31.452 --> 01:43:32.553]  No one controls us.
[01:43:32.613 --> 01:43:33.494]  We are not puppets.
[01:43:33.875 --> 01:43:34.996]  We don't have teleprompters.
[01:43:35.036 --> 01:43:36.257]  I'm not reading a teleprompter.
[01:43:36.898 --> 01:43:39.540]  I'm giving it to you straight every single day from my point of view.
[01:43:40.101 --> 01:43:41.842]  And by the way, I really want to thank the callers.
[01:43:42.683 --> 01:43:50.369]  And in fact, for the fourth hour today, I want to open up the phones to take calls from people to do two things.
[01:43:50.649 --> 01:43:58.334]  You can call and ask a question of me if you want, or you can call and offer your own comment or a suggestion about what Trump should do in your opinion.
[01:43:58.775 --> 01:44:01.797]  So for the fourth hour today, I want to take a lot of calls.
[01:44:02.137 --> 01:44:07.541]  I've been listening to the calls over the last several days, and you callers have been amazing.
[01:44:08.041 --> 01:44:09.602]  Your information is outstanding.
[01:44:09.622 --> 01:44:14.826]  In fact, this phrase, a global 9-11 event, that came from a caller.
[01:44:14.846 --> 01:44:19.790]  I regret I don't know that caller's name, but that was a call that came in, and it's absolutely right.
[01:44:19.810 --> 01:44:23.572]  This is a global 9-11 style event taking place right now.
[01:44:23.932 --> 01:44:26.935]  And where Alex is absolutely correct is that this is engineered.
[01:44:27.898 --> 01:44:30.520]  This is a human weapon, or a weapon against humanity.
[01:44:31.180 --> 01:44:33.262]  This was released on purpose.
[01:44:34.002 --> 01:44:36.184]  Now there's debate about who released it and why.
[01:44:36.504 --> 01:44:40.987]  But it was in a Chinese lab, that much is clear, at least that's what we currently believe.
[01:44:41.327 --> 01:44:53.015]  But it was engineered using technology that was funded by Obama and allowed to be transferred to China by Obama-connected individuals and universities that were taking money from China and things like that.
[01:44:53.415 --> 01:44:57.698]  So Alex is absolutely right in my opinion that this is an engineered global event.
[01:44:58.858 --> 01:45:07.422]  However, where I think a lot of Trump supporters are currently wrong is in thinking that it's a hoax because the left-wing media is talking about it.
[01:45:08.042 --> 01:45:10.103]  So yes, the left-wing media lies all the time.
[01:45:11.184 --> 01:45:13.585]  They've lied about Trump, you know, for the last three years.
[01:45:13.605 --> 01:45:14.445]  They've lied about Russia.
[01:45:14.465 --> 01:45:15.405]  They've lied about impeachment.
[01:45:15.425 --> 01:45:16.426]  They lie about Alex.
[01:45:16.446 --> 01:45:17.686]  They lie about everybody.
[01:45:17.746 --> 01:45:18.527]  They lie about me.
[01:45:20.227 --> 01:45:22.548]  But it doesn't mean that they're lying about this.
[01:45:23.048 --> 01:45:23.569]  In fact,
[01:45:24.591 --> 01:45:29.254]  Occasionally, even the lying left-wing media will collide with something that's true.
[01:45:29.754 --> 01:45:31.796]  They are using it to try to bring down Trump.
[01:45:32.196 --> 01:45:34.057]  But that doesn't mean there isn't a virus.
[01:45:34.377 --> 01:45:37.359]  It doesn't mean that PCR genetic testing isn't real.
[01:45:37.860 --> 01:45:47.206]  I've even heard that argument from some people across the independent media, who are calling me and telling me, hey, viruses don't exist and PCR testing doesn't work.
[01:45:47.646 --> 01:45:49.648]  Like, come on, give me a break.
[01:45:50.068 --> 01:45:51.329]  I run a science lab, okay?
[01:45:52.289 --> 01:45:53.851]  I've run PCR equipment.
[01:45:54.171 --> 01:45:56.613]  You can use it to test for bacteria in food.
[01:45:57.074 --> 01:46:02.999]  I can take a food sample, I can put it in the machine, and in 30 hours it tells me whether there's horse protein in there.
[01:46:03.179 --> 01:46:03.399]  Okay?
[01:46:03.780 --> 01:46:04.500]  How does that work?
[01:46:04.801 --> 01:46:12.988]  Because horse DNA is replicated by the PCR technology, and then it's analyzed and sequenced in the software, and it can tell me, hey, there's horse protein in there.
[01:46:13.368 --> 01:46:14.649]  The technology's real, folks.
[01:46:15.310 --> 01:46:16.871]  Don't be flat earthers on this, okay?
[01:46:16.891 --> 01:46:22.816]  Don't be like the flat earth version of virology to say there's no viruses.
[01:46:23.417 --> 01:46:24.397]  Viruses are real.
[01:46:24.818 --> 01:46:26.179]  PCR technology works.
[01:46:26.779 --> 01:46:28.661]  And as I've stated before, the earth is a sphere.
[01:46:28.921 --> 01:46:36.747]  So we have to start with some really basic things in order to tackle the reality that's hitting us right now.
[01:46:36.928 --> 01:46:44.374]  And whether Owen Schroyer has a slightly different view, or Alex Jones has a different view, or myself, Mike Adams, has a different view, or Gary Haven, what we all
[01:46:45.054 --> 01:47:09.260]  care about is saving America, helping Trump win and conquer this and beat this thing, restoring the Republic, conserving civil liberties, and defeating the deep state criminals, the traitors, the child pedophiles on the left, the corrupt criminal cartels of the Clintons and the Bidens and the Obamas.
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:10.840]  We have to defeat that.
[01:47:11.886 --> 01:47:16.450]  But they have laid a vicious trap for Trump right now with this virus, a vicious trap.
[01:47:17.351 --> 01:47:24.017]  And if Trump doesn't navigate this very, very carefully and decisively and quickly, Trump will be destroyed by this.
[01:47:25.089 --> 01:47:30.175]  And Gary Haven agrees with my assessment on that and thinks Trump has only a week to take decisive action.
[01:47:30.215 --> 01:47:31.196]  Now what will that action be?
[01:47:31.737 --> 01:47:38.585]  We're going to talk to Stuart Rhodes on the other side of this break about maybe what Trump could do right now that doesn't violate our constitutional rights.
[01:47:39.066 --> 01:47:43.591]  Because if we beat the virus but we end up enslaved under tyranny, that's no solution either.
[01:47:44.292 --> 01:47:49.822]  How do we beat the virus and save our republic and save Trump and still have a Second Amendment?
[01:47:50.123 --> 01:47:52.507]  We'll find out after this break with Stuart Rhodes.
[01:47:52.807 --> 01:47:53.268]  Stay with us.
[01:47:53.288 --> 01:47:55.492]  This is Mike Adams here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:56.963 --> 01:48:01.927]  All right, we're going to have Stuart Rhodes from Oath Keepers joining us here in just a second, but I want to point out something.
[01:48:01.967 --> 01:48:08.193]  You know, I don't believe in numerology in a superstitious kind of way, but the globalists do.
[01:48:08.993 --> 01:48:11.235]  And people like David Icke have spoken about this before.
[01:48:11.275 --> 01:48:15.078]  The globalists use certain number patterns and dates.
[01:48:15.839 --> 01:48:17.820]  To spring events on humanity.
[01:48:18.401 --> 01:48:20.742]  And let me point out something to you that's going to blow your mind.
[01:48:21.303 --> 01:48:24.285]  Today, the WHO declared a global pandemic.
[01:48:24.345 --> 01:48:25.686]  They waited to do it today.
[01:48:26.166 --> 01:48:26.746]  What is today?
[01:48:27.347 --> 01:48:27.687]  March 11th.
[01:48:29.784 --> 01:48:31.885]  And March 11th is six months away from 9-11.
[01:48:33.406 --> 01:48:40.810]  March 11th is also nine years to the day after the Fukushima disaster, which was March 11, 2011.
[01:48:43.031 --> 01:48:54.436]  So we have nine years after a March 11 disaster of Fukushima, that's 9-11, for the WHO pandemic that is today, March 11, 2020.
[01:48:55.497 --> 01:48:57.478]  So the globalists are obsessed with numbers.
[01:48:58.345 --> 01:49:07.751]  And even though I tend to approach things from a very scientific point of view, and again, like I said, I don't follow numerology from a mystical point of view, but the globalists do.
[01:49:09.092 --> 01:49:10.053]  This tells us something.
[01:49:10.253 --> 01:49:15.116]  That they believe this is their kill switch for humanity.
[01:49:15.316 --> 01:49:20.460]  That globalists have planned this and engineered it and launched it on the right day.
[01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:24.422]  And they think, you know, the stars are aligned and everything on this right day.
[01:49:24.462 --> 01:49:26.164]  I don't know what the planets and stars are doing today.
[01:49:26.204 --> 01:49:27.224]  That's not my venue.
[01:49:28.405 --> 01:49:30.807]  This is six months from 9-11, okay?
[01:49:31.067 --> 01:49:33.008]  And this is nine years after Fukushima, March 11.
[01:49:33.888 --> 01:49:37.290]  So, keep that in mind as you look at where this is going.
[01:49:37.330 --> 01:49:46.456]  Now, moving to constitutional rights or liberties and the constitutionality of possible martial law actions.
[01:49:47.036 --> 01:49:51.019]  Stuart Rhodes joins us now to help us understand what's about to happen.
[01:49:51.519 --> 01:49:52.600]  The context of this
[01:49:53.400 --> 01:50:01.147]  Is of course that New York has already deployed the National Guard there to create a containment zone around a town called New Rochelle.
[01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:09.114]  And the state of Washington, through Governor Inslee there, has just banned all public events involving 250 or more people.
[01:50:09.134 --> 01:50:17.062]  And that governor's talking about he's about to maybe quarantine the entire state or maybe the city of Seattle, I'm not sure exactly.
[01:50:17.562 --> 01:50:19.484]  But he's talking like something big is coming.
[01:50:21.058 --> 01:50:23.019]  Will we survive this with our liberties intact?
[01:50:23.899 --> 01:50:28.442]  Oath Keepers founder Stuart Rhodes joins us now by video and audio.
[01:50:28.462 --> 01:50:29.762]  Thank you for joining me, Stuart.
[01:50:30.282 --> 01:50:31.023]  It's great to have you on.
[01:50:32.335 --> 01:50:32.935]  Yeah, likewise.
[01:50:33.015 --> 01:50:33.315]  Thank you.
[01:50:34.136 --> 01:50:38.117]  So Stuart, I know that you're very concerned, as I am, about where this is headed.
[01:50:39.218 --> 01:50:49.262]  We did an interview the other day and you said that Trump needs to take decisive action, but you're also very concerned about, you know, martial law and how easily the American people might just accept it blindly and give up all their liberties.
[01:50:50.162 --> 01:50:52.763]  What's your overview of where we are now and what needs to happen?
[01:50:54.488 --> 01:50:57.910]  Well, first of all, martial law is unconstitutional.
[01:50:57.970 --> 01:50:59.171]  It's nowhere in the Constitution.
[01:50:59.471 --> 01:51:01.012]  And frankly, you should stop using that term.
[01:51:01.573 --> 01:51:03.094]  I think it's a mistake to do that.
[01:51:03.634 --> 01:51:09.117]  But where we are right now is that, as you've said, and I agree, Trump must take decisive action.
[01:51:09.138 --> 01:51:11.219]  He must do that within the bounds of the Constitution.
[01:51:11.878 --> 01:51:14.599]  I don't think the American people are going to accept anything else.
[01:51:15.179 --> 01:51:18.419]  I don't think they're going to accept him setting aside the Constitution or trying to.
[01:51:18.439 --> 01:51:24.420]  They've lost all confidence in the federal government and the state governments on both sides of the political spectrum.
[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:27.341]  But there are things he can do that are perfectly constitutional.
[01:51:27.761 --> 01:51:31.582]  He can still stop all incoming flights from foreign countries, and he should.
[01:51:31.602 --> 01:51:36.263]  He can also still lock down domestic airlines travel.
[01:51:36.483 --> 01:51:37.903]  I think that is perfectly constitutional.
[01:51:38.303 --> 01:51:39.743]  I think he can and should do these things.
[01:51:40.064 --> 01:51:46.125]  And he could use his position of leadership to call for the closure of all the public schools in all the states.
[01:51:46.185 --> 01:51:51.707]  And I do think it's constitutional for the governors of the states to take these actions and close all the schools.
[01:51:52.007 --> 01:52:04.791]  He can also activate, call on the Federal Service, the National Guard, and deploy the Army and Navy Reserve units to go and deploy medical hospitals throughout the entire country and prepare for the overload that we know is going to happen.
[01:52:05.211 --> 01:52:11.634]  They should be setting up field hospitals right now to handle the influx that we're going to see, just like Illegas saw.
[01:52:12.334 --> 01:52:15.716]  Now, okay, and what about the borders, specifically the Mexico border?
[01:52:15.736 --> 01:52:16.356]  What should he do there?
[01:52:16.376 --> 01:52:17.977]  He should put the U.S.
[01:52:18.017 --> 01:52:18.817]  military on the border.
[01:52:20.726 --> 01:52:28.013]  Constitutional within his rights to do that, within his rights as president, his powers as president, and also his duty as a president.
[01:52:28.233 --> 01:52:29.234]  And I've been preaching this for years.
[01:52:29.274 --> 01:52:32.137]  I know you've been saying the same thing, and we've both been right about that.
[01:52:32.337 --> 01:52:33.518]  So there's many things he could do.
[01:52:33.538 --> 01:52:37.441]  You'd lock down the country and defend it from external threats.
[01:52:37.822 --> 01:52:43.507]  You don't let it come in and then turn around and use draconian martial law on American people.
[01:52:43.567 --> 01:52:44.348]  It's unconstitutional.
[01:52:45.037 --> 01:52:50.123]  Okay, so what about then the argument, I'll play devil's advocate with you here a bit on this.
[01:52:51.144 --> 01:52:54.228]  Your video is breaking up just a little bit, but it's still mostly good.
[01:52:55.470 --> 01:53:02.958]  What about in places like Seattle, where if you don't lock down a city,
[01:53:03.599 --> 01:53:06.621]  Where it's spreading, then it's just going to continue to replicate.
[01:53:06.641 --> 01:53:07.702]  It's already in the country.
[01:53:07.762 --> 01:53:17.008]  So yeah, we block the borders, we block the international flights, but it's already endemic in the Seattle area right now and it's exploding in areas of New York and Boston and so on.
[01:53:17.288 --> 01:53:18.329]  What do you do with those areas?
[01:53:19.178 --> 01:53:23.703]  Well, we just published a recommendation open letter to the governors of the United States.
[01:53:24.183 --> 01:53:26.466]  So if you want to bring that up, I'll show that to you.
[01:53:26.786 --> 01:53:36.316]  But the first thing we tell them is that they should take this seriously, they should declare an emergency, but they should immediately do what Korea has done, what South Korea has done, which is do massive testing.
[01:53:36.616 --> 01:53:41.999]  And they should do a drive-through testing or, you know, or sending teams out to people's homes.
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:53.247]  What they should not do is have people going into already crowded emergency rooms and bringing this virus in there or going there because they're afraid they might be ill and they catch it from somebody else.
[01:53:53.587 --> 01:53:57.589]  So they must be tested in their homes or in their cars as they drive through.
[01:53:57.950 --> 01:54:03.213]  And they should also set up outdoor testing because we know this is airborne, so you don't want to be in a confined space.
[01:54:03.653 --> 01:54:08.582]  So have a screening area outdoors because some people will just insist on going to the hospital anyway.
[01:54:08.602 --> 01:54:11.447]  So in other words, you prepare for this and treat it seriously.
[01:54:11.667 --> 01:54:13.811]  But they have to accept the reality this is airborne.
[01:54:14.272 --> 01:54:14.973]  That's what this is.
[01:54:15.033 --> 01:54:15.795]  It's been confirmed.
[01:54:16.479 --> 01:54:27.446]  Well, when it comes to accepting reality, let's talk right now about, I still see a lot of Trump supporters out there in the message boards and the comment sections are saying that this whole thing in their minds is a hoax.
[01:54:27.506 --> 01:54:31.549]  They think that it's liberal governors declaring emergencies to try to embarrass Trump.
[01:54:32.130 --> 01:54:35.672]  They think that South by Southwest was canceled to try to embarrass Trump.
[01:54:36.132 --> 01:54:39.475]  They think that the whole thing is a hoax.
[01:54:39.515 --> 01:54:42.857]  What do you say to those people right now who aren't yet getting this?
[01:54:47.583 --> 01:54:48.264]  What's driving that?
[01:54:48.305 --> 01:54:51.310]  I think Trump himself is driving it and also people like Rush Limbaugh saying this.
[01:54:51.851 --> 01:54:54.877]  And frankly, I don't think Alex is helping with this situation.
[01:54:55.217 --> 01:54:57.181]  It's one thing to say this is a real problem.
[01:54:59.557 --> 01:55:03.058]  Okay, Stuart's signal is breaking up a little bit there.
[01:55:03.118 --> 01:55:10.682]  Stuart, let's try to reconnect with Stuart there and maybe send Stuart a blank screen instead of video to save on his bandwidth.
[01:55:10.702 --> 01:55:16.384]  But I think what Stuart was saying is that the President himself is not helping this situation and neither is Rush Limbaugh.
[01:55:16.724 --> 01:55:18.685]  I've been very critical of Rush Limbaugh as well.
[01:55:19.325 --> 01:55:23.227]  Rush is still saying it's just the flu and that's certainly not accurate.
[01:55:23.507 --> 01:55:25.888]  And the thing to understand, folks, is that
[01:55:26.448 --> 01:55:43.239]  You know, when those of us who voted for Trump and we support Trump and we want to take down the deep state, we want to restore the American Constitutional Republic and protect civil liberties, protect the Second Amendment and the First Amendment, when we criticize Trump about this, it is legitimate
[01:55:43.959 --> 01:55:46.080]  Criticism in the hopes that Trump succeeds.
[01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:50.142]  When the left-wing media criticizes Trump, it's because they hope he fails.
[01:55:50.603 --> 01:56:01.488]  And I wouldn't be surprised, and Alex even mentioned this, I wouldn't be surprised if there were Democrats running around America right now, literally spreading this pandemic on purpose to try to make the situation worse.
[01:56:01.528 --> 01:56:04.330]  We've already heard of some Democrats saying that
[01:56:04.850 --> 01:56:10.835]  They want to get the infection and then go to a Trump rally and spread it among Trump supporters.
[01:56:11.195 --> 01:56:13.937]  That's what radical left-wing people are wanting to do right now.
[01:56:14.057 --> 01:56:15.538]  They want this disease to spread.
[01:56:15.578 --> 01:56:16.879]  They want to take down America.
[01:56:17.179 --> 01:56:19.981]  You've heard Bill Maher talk about an economic collapse.
[01:56:20.021 --> 01:56:21.082]  They want that to happen.
[01:56:21.523 --> 01:56:24.345]  The difference is that Stuart Rhodes doesn't want America to collapse.
[01:56:24.645 --> 01:56:26.246]  Mike Adams doesn't want America to collapse.
[01:56:26.526 --> 01:56:28.448]  Gary Haven doesn't want America to collapse.
[01:56:28.508 --> 01:56:29.809]  And Alex Jones doesn't either.
[01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:35.192]  We want America to succeed, but we have to take some action right now to stop this infection.
[01:56:35.773 --> 01:56:38.474]  And folks, let me know when we've got Stewart back.
[01:56:38.875 --> 01:56:40.195]  Maybe it's going to be for the next segment.
[01:56:40.356 --> 01:56:43.117]  But we have to take decisive action right now.
[01:56:43.317 --> 01:56:44.998]  Otherwise, it's going to be...
[01:56:45.979 --> 01:56:47.199]  It's going to be catastrophic, okay?
[01:56:47.219 --> 01:56:55.382]  The hospitals in Italy are being overrun, and doctors there are now saying that it's near the state of collapse in northern Italy right now, today.
[01:56:56.082 --> 01:57:03.605]  And that's about three weeks away for some cities in America, if we don't start to take action to stop the flights, like Stuart just said.
[01:57:04.085 --> 01:57:09.227]  Stop the flights, block the borders, stop international flights, but also domestic flights as well.
[01:57:10.208 --> 01:57:12.749]  Trump has got to get on top of this or he will not survive this.
[01:57:12.829 --> 01:57:16.590]  His presidency may be over if he doesn't take action now.
[01:57:16.630 --> 01:57:17.370]  This is Mike Adams.
[01:57:17.450 --> 01:57:19.431]  We'll be back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:57:19.451 --> 01:57:19.931]  Stay with us.
[01:57:21.092 --> 01:57:25.693]  Alright, we're continuing with Stuart Rhodes here from Oath Keepers and let me just give out the phone number.
[01:57:25.713 --> 01:57:29.995]  We're going to start taking calls at 6 after in the next hour.
[01:57:30.055 --> 01:57:32.836]  That's 877-789-2539 and you can call with questions for me, suggestions for Trump,
[01:57:37.077 --> 01:57:41.280]  Or general comments, but we're going to keep the calls really, really short so we can get a lot of calls in.
[01:57:41.680 --> 01:57:45.503]  Now, I've got a challenge here for Stuart Rhodes, whose connection is back on for us.
[01:57:45.884 --> 01:57:46.724]  So we'll continue with Stuart.
[01:57:47.044 --> 01:57:47.845]  Here's the challenge, Stuart.
[01:57:47.885 --> 01:57:50.747]  I've run the mathematical modeling of this on the pandemic.
[01:57:50.787 --> 01:57:52.368]  I've even released the public spreadsheet.
[01:57:52.388 --> 01:57:53.990]  I think you've seen it as well.
[01:57:54.530 --> 01:58:02.176]  And if you look at an R-naught value of the virus of around 6.0, which is that may be high, may be low, we're not sure.
[01:58:02.816 --> 01:58:16.627]  But with an R0 value of 6.0, you have to have about 83% containment of stopping new infections in order for you to avoid an exponential trajectory of the spread of this virus.
[01:58:16.707 --> 01:58:26.455]  So how do we achieve an 83% containment without having some kind of nationwide shelter-in-place lockdown order?
[01:58:26.916 --> 01:58:28.137]  You know, how do we even achieve that?
[01:58:28.177 --> 01:58:29.358]  Or do we just say, forget it?
[01:58:29.898 --> 01:58:33.179]  You know, we're just going to lose 10 million people and we just forget about it.
[01:58:34.099 --> 01:58:34.639]  How do we do that?
[01:58:35.620 --> 01:58:47.323]  Well, you do it by closing the schools, by stopping the mass transit, which the President has the authority to do, and you do it by him then making it very obvious then that it's serious.
[01:58:47.923 --> 01:58:50.204]  And you've got one half of the country who then listens to him.
[01:58:50.680 --> 01:58:52.241]  When it's, when they know it's serious.
[01:58:52.581 --> 01:58:54.882]  Who are not right at this point are not listening.
[01:58:55.222 --> 01:58:56.963]  Most of your conservatives are not listening at all.
[01:58:57.363 --> 01:59:04.446]  So the best way to do that is to have him stand up with leadership and say, as you said earlier, you know, I've been giving bad advice.
[01:59:04.466 --> 01:59:05.707]  I'm going to fire Pence.
[01:59:05.727 --> 01:59:08.488]  He should fire Pence and bring in a new vice president.
[01:59:08.868 --> 01:59:18.392]  And he should just clean house and been to stand up and say, I was misled, but now I'm going to do what's necessary and lead by his own example, shut down his own mass rallies and do those over the internet.
[01:59:18.732 --> 01:59:20.253]  And then, then people will listen.
[01:59:20.854 --> 01:59:23.856]  Whether the Democrats listen or not after that, who knows?
[01:59:23.936 --> 01:59:26.318]  But for now, at least the conservatives will listen.
[01:59:26.678 --> 01:59:27.379]  And that's what you do.
[01:59:27.399 --> 01:59:30.481]  Then you encourage the governors to do the same thing in their states.
[01:59:30.661 --> 01:59:33.643]  And there's a lot the governors in local counties can do.
[01:59:33.724 --> 01:59:36.085]  They can shut down mass gatherings.
[01:59:36.846 --> 01:59:41.029]  The health inspector for the county can deny permits for concerts, etc., etc.
[01:59:41.089 --> 01:59:43.451]  There's more leeway at the local level.
[01:59:44.008 --> 01:59:44.488]  Yes, yes.
[01:59:44.868 --> 01:59:49.509]  Well, I can see if Trump comes out and says, yes, this thing is real, yes, we have to start taking these precautions.
[01:59:49.549 --> 01:59:57.071]  I can see the left-wing media the very next day saying, ah, no, we decided it's not real anymore, because we're going to say the opposite of President Trump, you know?
[01:59:57.392 --> 01:59:57.932]  That could happen.
[01:59:58.292 --> 01:59:59.792]  What about the situation in New York?
[02:00:00.192 --> 02:00:03.593]  Do you have any intel from your members on the ground there in New York?
[02:00:03.693 --> 02:00:10.115]  What role exactly is the National Guard playing there with the, quote, containment zone around New Rochelle?
[02:00:11.388 --> 02:00:13.849]  Well, it is an unfortunate term they use.
[02:00:14.250 --> 02:00:16.731]  They're not actually quarantining that entire area.
[02:00:17.111 --> 02:00:19.893]  They're just using it as they're shutting down the schools inside of it.
[02:00:20.373 --> 02:00:24.715]  And they're taking heightened precautions, no big public events, things like that.
[02:00:25.116 --> 02:00:27.137]  And I would hope they're doing aggressive testing.
[02:00:27.977 --> 02:00:31.059]  So why do you need National Guard troops there to just shut down schools?
[02:00:32.360 --> 02:00:34.101]  To assist with the testing.
[02:00:34.701 --> 02:00:35.742]  That's what I would use them for.
[02:00:36.362 --> 02:00:38.003]  But we'll see what Governor Cuomo does.
[02:00:38.547 --> 02:00:40.108]  But that's what the National Guard is for.
[02:00:40.168 --> 02:00:46.571]  National Guard, I mean, it's not like National Guard does nothing or there's martial law and military rule.
[02:00:46.591 --> 02:00:50.493]  There's an entire spectrum in between what the National Guard is there to do.
[02:00:50.513 --> 02:00:54.416]  And they've done that throughout their entire history because they are part of the militia.
[02:00:54.836 --> 02:00:56.577]  The rest of us are supposed to be the rest of the militia.
[02:00:57.377 --> 02:01:01.700]  But they are useful and properly useful for emergencies like this.
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:08.043]  They should be setting up testing centers, outdoor testing centers, drive-by testing centers like South Korea has done.
[02:01:08.413 --> 02:01:16.829]  That's why the South Koreans are getting a handle on it, because they are aggressively testing 10,000 people every day, from what I've heard.
[02:01:17.341 --> 02:01:17.821]  I agree with you.
[02:01:17.841 --> 02:01:23.223]  Yeah, South Korea is getting a handle on this by having lots and lots of testing.
[02:01:23.824 --> 02:01:27.545]  And Italy has done a nationwide, you know, shelter-in-place type of scenario.
[02:01:28.546 --> 02:01:32.087]  However, it seems to me that we're kind of just chasing these scenarios.
[02:01:32.147 --> 02:01:37.729]  So Governor Inslee from Washington, he's so far ordered the shutdown of any events over 250 people.
[02:01:38.270 --> 02:01:41.311]  But it seems like a week from now, that's going to have to get escalated.
[02:01:41.371 --> 02:01:44.412]  And then two weeks from now, it's going to have to be a shelter-in-place type of thing.
[02:01:44.992 --> 02:01:46.173]  You know, it's almost like
[02:01:47.307 --> 02:01:52.931]  If they were to bite the bullet early, then you could really stop this thing in its tracks.
[02:01:53.012 --> 02:01:58.056]  Otherwise, you're just chasing the curve that's exponential, and you're always behind it.
[02:01:58.156 --> 02:01:59.076]  That's what it seems like.
[02:02:00.377 --> 02:02:04.300]  Well, yeah, you can take whatever action you can, but they have to be within the bounds of the Constitution.
[02:02:04.741 --> 02:02:06.983]  I don't think the Constitution is a suicide pact.
[02:02:07.023 --> 02:02:08.804]  I think not following it is suicidal.
[02:02:09.164 --> 02:02:15.569]  And frankly, there are just too many Americans in this country who are not going to put up with any level of government setting it aside.
[02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:16.450]  This is not going to happen.
[02:02:16.866 --> 02:02:19.150]  If they try it, they'll be fighting.
[02:02:19.571 --> 02:02:21.995]  There'll be resistance, armed resistance to it.
[02:02:22.356 --> 02:02:25.862]  So I think when you set that aside, don't even talk about it anymore.
[02:02:26.222 --> 02:02:29.368]  Just focus on what can be done within the bounds of the Constitution and get it done.
[02:02:30.184 --> 02:02:33.965]  But I think the American people will also self-shelter.
[02:02:34.205 --> 02:02:34.965]  We're already seeing it.
[02:02:34.985 --> 02:02:38.346]  We're already seeing a reduction in people attending theaters and restaurants.
[02:02:38.746 --> 02:02:43.168]  And that's why Trump's leadership or the governor's leadership can make the difference.
[02:02:43.208 --> 02:02:45.488]  People will have their own self-interest in mind.
[02:02:45.508 --> 02:02:46.188]  They'll stay home.
[02:02:46.629 --> 02:02:47.689]  And I think that's going to happen.
[02:02:48.493 --> 02:02:49.693]  Well, you're absolutely right about that.
[02:02:50.094 --> 02:02:56.036]  We've already seen people stopping air flights voluntarily, and very few people on cruise ships right now.
[02:02:56.056 --> 02:02:57.757]  A lot of people are sheltering in place.
[02:02:57.857 --> 02:03:04.779]  I announced today I'm no longer going into the Infowar studios, so I'm kind of prepared to shelter in place, so to speak.
[02:03:04.799 --> 02:03:06.120]  I don't even like that phrase, by the way.
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:12.262]  I don't like it when governors use that phrase when they really mean martial law, by the way.
[02:03:12.762 --> 02:03:16.064]  And by the way, you said maybe I should stop using the term martial law.
[02:03:16.184 --> 02:03:16.744]  What's a better
[02:03:18.524 --> 02:03:27.606]  Well, what I mean is don't use that to mean that anything that's done to handle this is martial law.
[02:03:27.826 --> 02:03:30.087]  Martial law has a specific meaning.
[02:03:30.407 --> 02:03:34.207]  It means military rule of the commander on the battlefield.
[02:03:34.247 --> 02:03:36.628]  It means military dictatorship.
[02:03:36.648 --> 02:03:37.248]  That's what it is.
[02:03:37.508 --> 02:03:41.049]  Like we impose on occupied Japan when MacArthur ruled Japan.
[02:03:42.128 --> 02:03:42.949]  We're good to go.
[02:04:04.511 --> 02:04:05.712]  With enforcing a quarantine.
[02:04:06.252 --> 02:04:09.654]  If you have a person who has an infection, you can quarantine them.
[02:04:09.994 --> 02:04:10.774]  That is legal.
[02:04:11.034 --> 02:04:18.898]  When they took people off that Diamond Princess and put them in an airport space here in Texas, where I'm at right now, you know, that was legal and lawful.
[02:04:18.918 --> 02:04:21.659]  And when they confined them to that space, that's also legal and lawful.
[02:04:21.900 --> 02:04:23.200]  That's not martial law.
[02:04:23.540 --> 02:04:25.882]  That's just putting those people who are infected into quarantine.
[02:04:25.902 --> 02:04:27.502]  They don't want to be in quarantine.
[02:04:27.562 --> 02:04:28.543]  They can stay overseas.
[02:04:29.847 --> 02:04:30.988]  So I hear what you're saying.
[02:04:31.168 --> 02:04:38.856]  I think what you're describing is that we need to understand the full spectrum of responses and use accurate language to describe what's happening.
[02:04:38.876 --> 02:04:49.346]  For example, if the National Guard is out there just helping with infrastructure, food deliveries, or maintaining the healthcare infrastructure, that's not martial law just because they're carrying rifles.
[02:04:49.386 --> 02:04:49.987]  That's what you're saying.
[02:04:50.919 --> 02:04:52.962]  Or testing.
[02:04:53.282 --> 02:04:56.446]  But you also said earlier that you think maybe the U.S.
[02:04:56.487 --> 02:05:00.232]  military should right now be operating in the U.S.
[02:05:00.252 --> 02:05:06.380]  to help set up medical facilities, perhaps triage units that might be necessary.
[02:05:07.041 --> 02:05:08.443]  Is that constitutional?
[02:05:09.574 --> 02:05:10.354]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:05:10.374 --> 02:05:14.576]  That's what the Army Reserve and the Navy Reserve does all the time.
[02:05:14.836 --> 02:05:25.901]  When we were down in Puerto Rico for the disaster relief after the hurricane there, we worked directly with Army Reserve units that had set up a field hospital outside of a dysfunctional Puerto Rican hospital.
[02:05:26.281 --> 02:05:27.822]  So yeah, it's absolutely constitutional.
[02:05:27.842 --> 02:05:28.682]  It's part of their mission.
[02:05:30.164 --> 02:05:38.058]  Once again, they're not running around trying Americans by military tribunal, they're running around setting up field hospitals to help people.
[02:05:38.599 --> 02:05:39.941]  I think that's perfectly constitutional.
[02:05:40.447 --> 02:05:43.250]  Okay, but there's a very slippery slope in this.
[02:05:43.310 --> 02:05:56.942]  We saw in China, I'm not saying that we're China, but just as an extreme example, China would then have armed squads show up at your house, take your temperature, and then arrest you and take you away and throw you into basically a coronavirus death camp.
[02:05:57.483 --> 02:06:02.728]  So we don't want to see anything go in that direction in the United States, but isn't there some risk?
[02:06:03.368 --> 02:06:13.447]  That troops on the streets or in the communities could then just suddenly be told, OK, start start going door to door, take their guns and arrest people who have a temperature.
[02:06:13.588 --> 02:06:14.089]  Could that happen?
[02:06:16.089 --> 02:06:17.449]  I mean, I suppose it could happen.
[02:06:17.489 --> 02:06:20.130]  I mean, you get some idiot like Cuomo, who knows what's going to happen.
[02:06:20.510 --> 02:06:22.771]  So, sure, it's a potential danger.
[02:06:23.311 --> 02:06:26.811]  But the thing is, like you said before, you've got to get ahead of the curve.
[02:06:27.172 --> 02:06:29.292]  So they should use the resources they have available to them.
[02:06:29.312 --> 02:06:37.274]  Like right here in Texas, Texas Governor Abbott should activate his National Guard, his Texas National Guard, his Texas State Defense Force.
[02:06:37.834 --> 02:06:40.796]  And get them busy assisting with testing.
[02:06:41.096 --> 02:06:44.118]  That's the most important thing you can do right now, is test, test, test.
[02:06:44.538 --> 02:06:49.420]  I mean, you know, Gary David said it, you've said it, I've said it, it's a common sense thing to do.
[02:06:49.701 --> 02:06:51.081]  The South Koreans are doing that.
[02:06:51.401 --> 02:06:54.603]  So let's just go ahead and do what we know we can do and get it done.
[02:06:55.144 --> 02:07:01.447]  And you know, and then you don't have to worry so much about, you know, worst case scenarios when you've got dead bodies stacked up,
[02:07:01.826 --> 02:07:01.926]  Yeah.
[02:07:16.411 --> 02:07:22.735]  You know, I think most people who are sick would be totally fine with... All right, Stuart, we're going to go to break here.
[02:07:23.275 --> 02:07:23.735]  Stay with us.
[02:07:23.755 --> 02:07:24.856]  We just got a short break.
[02:07:25.296 --> 02:07:27.177]  Stay with us for five more minutes on the other side, please.
[02:07:27.237 --> 02:07:29.178]  I want to ask you a couple more questions.
[02:07:29.698 --> 02:07:34.981]  Fascinating discussion about civil liberties and the constitutionality of what may be about to happen across America.
[02:07:35.021 --> 02:07:36.882]  This is Mike Adams, Alex Jones Show.
[02:07:37.062 --> 02:07:37.603]  We'll be right back.
[02:07:38.717 --> 02:07:42.999]  COVID-19 is the new global 9-11.
[02:07:43.920 --> 02:08:03.709]  This is the attack on humanity, the engineered attack for depopulation and also to try to take out President Trump, who has so far resisted every effort of removal by the treacherous, treasonous, deep state that despises America, despises the Constitution, hates Trump, hates Infowars and all of us.
[02:08:03.749 --> 02:08:06.911]  They want to take our guns, take our speech, take our rights, take our lives.
[02:08:07.791 --> 02:08:08.611]  How are we going to stop them?
[02:08:08.831 --> 02:08:09.792]  That's what we're exploring today.
[02:08:09.832 --> 02:08:12.992]  We've got just a few more minutes here with Stuart Rhodes from Oath Keepers.
[02:08:13.212 --> 02:08:14.753]  OathKeepers.org is the website.
[02:08:15.573 --> 02:08:20.154]  And Stuart, I just want to thank you for all your explanations and thoughts on this today.
[02:08:20.554 --> 02:08:25.276]  Do you agree that we have a very narrow path to navigate here?
[02:08:25.356 --> 02:08:30.017]  We've got to beat this virus, but we've somehow got to defend the Constitution and keep the Republic intact.
[02:08:30.577 --> 02:08:34.538]  Have we ever faced something like this since, I don't know, World War II?
[02:08:36.079 --> 02:08:36.439]  Well, sure.
[02:08:36.459 --> 02:08:36.939]  It was called 9-11.
[02:08:38.092 --> 02:08:39.613]  Well, yeah, okay, sure.
[02:08:39.813 --> 02:08:43.815]  We set aside a lot of our rights and, you know, they crossed the Rubicon.
[02:08:43.835 --> 02:08:50.679]  They did things that they never should have done, detaining two American citizens in military tribunals and military detention.
[02:08:51.100 --> 02:08:54.402]  And so you had, then you had conservatives back then supporting that because Bush was doing it.
[02:08:54.822 --> 02:08:56.383]  So this is a dangerous territory.
[02:08:56.763 --> 02:08:57.664]  It's very dangerous.
[02:08:58.084 --> 02:09:01.406]  And it could be, this is going to be used to destroy our Constitution.
[02:09:01.786 --> 02:09:02.687]  So we can't do that.
[02:09:02.707 --> 02:09:06.729]  We can't run around with our hair on fire and throw the Constitution in the trash can.
[02:09:07.582 --> 02:09:10.863]  At the same time, though, we can't be complacent and say this is no big deal.
[02:09:10.963 --> 02:09:12.283]  It's just the flu.
[02:09:12.543 --> 02:09:17.325]  There's a middle ground there where you do what you can inside the bounds of the Constitution.
[02:09:17.365 --> 02:09:18.665]  You don't step outside of it.
[02:09:19.105 --> 02:09:20.165]  I've got no option.
[02:09:20.225 --> 02:09:22.146]  I swore an oath of support in front of the Constitution.
[02:09:22.166 --> 02:09:26.987]  I take that seriously, and I'm under duty obligation to enforce it.
[02:09:27.527 --> 02:09:29.067]  And the same goes for the President of the United States.
[02:09:29.107 --> 02:09:34.149]  He has no right, no power to step outside the Constitution.
[02:09:34.809 --> 02:09:35.369]  None of us do.
[02:09:35.751 --> 02:09:38.292]  And so, you know, we have to take a hard stand on that.
[02:09:38.752 --> 02:09:40.033]  You must be within the bounds.
[02:09:40.093 --> 02:09:45.155]  But within the bounds, there's a lot of things you can do to mitigate and take care of this.
[02:09:45.655 --> 02:09:46.596]  You're going to have losses.
[02:09:46.636 --> 02:09:46.856]  Why?
[02:09:46.876 --> 02:09:52.319]  Because they failed to do what they should have done, which is lock our borders down and exclude the outside world.
[02:09:52.619 --> 02:09:53.819]  They failed to do that.
[02:09:53.839 --> 02:09:55.260]  We're now going to pay the price.
[02:09:55.731 --> 02:09:56.832]  Yeah, that's true.
[02:09:57.452 --> 02:10:01.095]  So much of our federal government right now is already outside the bounds of what's constitutional.
[02:10:01.135 --> 02:10:09.482]  As you well know, I'm not telling you anything new, but even the very existence of the CDC or even FEMA is arguably unconstitutional right now.
[02:10:09.582 --> 02:10:16.387]  The fiefdoms of these federal regulators from FTC to DEA to FDA, they're all unconstitutional.
[02:10:16.407 --> 02:10:18.129]  They're all run by unelected bureaucrats.
[02:10:19.490 --> 02:10:28.736]  And yet, Trump is limited by the Constitution, but the rest of the government seems to be limited by nothing, especially the deep state traitors, the Obama holdovers, and so on.
[02:10:28.756 --> 02:10:29.937]  They're not limited by law.
[02:10:30.277 --> 02:10:33.540]  They can do anything, and they never get held to account.
[02:10:34.120 --> 02:10:35.801]  How can Trump navigate that situation?
[02:10:35.821 --> 02:10:38.263]  I mean, they're trying to destroy him and the country at the same time.
[02:10:39.084 --> 02:10:42.046]  And he's got very few powers, relatively speaking.
[02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:50.795]  No, he's got, he can lock down the border, he can exclude, he should still do it, exclude all the, exclude the outside world for now.
[02:10:51.235 --> 02:10:52.075]  Quarantine us.
[02:10:52.576 --> 02:10:54.837]  Quarantine the rest of the world, basically.
[02:10:55.117 --> 02:10:57.599]  Lock it down like the Saudis just did, or like Israel's doing.
[02:10:57.899 --> 02:11:00.040]  You don't get into Israel now without going through a quarantine.
[02:11:00.300 --> 02:11:01.441]  He can do that right now.
[02:11:01.841 --> 02:11:09.066]  And by that leadership, he will make sure the people of the United States understand this is real and really serious, and then he can
[02:11:09.995 --> 02:11:14.897]  What should he do then if a judge in Hawaii, appointed by Obama, says, oh, you can't do that, just like has happened many times before?
[02:11:14.917 --> 02:11:19.098]  What should Trump do now, under these circumstances, if these liberal judges try to block him?
[02:11:33.103 --> 02:11:34.504]  You should do what Andrew Jackson did.
[02:11:34.524 --> 02:11:38.006]  He said, the court's made a decision, now I can enforce it.
[02:11:38.346 --> 02:11:41.048]  And you should just go do what's necessary to defend American lives.
[02:11:41.148 --> 02:11:41.528]  Period.
[02:11:42.109 --> 02:11:43.269]  So he's got to be hardcore.
[02:11:44.670 --> 02:11:52.495]  I agree, but does he have enough support at the Pentagon to carry out those orders, even if judges, liberal judges in Hawaii are telling him not to do it?
[02:11:53.416 --> 02:11:54.517]  We'll find out, won't we?
[02:11:54.877 --> 02:11:56.458]  But he has to do it to find out.
[02:11:56.798 --> 02:11:58.779]  That's not the answer I wanted to hear.
[02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:00.120]  That's the problem.
[02:12:00.140 --> 02:12:01.361]  He's got to man up and act.
[02:12:01.900 --> 02:12:03.021]  It demands of an act.
[02:12:03.201 --> 02:12:09.324]  I think those of us who took that oath will take it seriously and support him, as long as he's within the bounds of the Constitution.
[02:12:09.784 --> 02:12:10.124]  All right.
[02:12:10.224 --> 02:12:13.025]  So, Stuart Rhodes, thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:12:13.125 --> 02:12:15.246]  Very valuable insight and analysis.
[02:12:15.667 --> 02:12:23.190]  We're going to continue now through the fourth hour with your phone calls coming up, your questions, your comments, and your advice for President Trump.
[02:12:23.510 --> 02:12:25.872]  This is Mike Adams here on InfoWars.com.
[02:12:25.892 --> 02:12:26.432]  We'll be right back.
[02:12:28.323 --> 02:12:30.664]  All right, we are continuing now for the fourth hour.
[02:12:30.724 --> 02:12:32.205]  This is Mike Adams from Natural News.
[02:12:33.005 --> 02:12:36.507]  We're going to take your calls with questions and suggestions for President Trump.
[02:12:36.527 --> 02:12:41.208]  We've had a fascinating discussion over the last hour with Gary Haven as well as Stuart Rhodes.
[02:12:41.249 --> 02:12:44.110]  I've got my own analysis that you've heard over the last few days as well.
[02:12:45.170 --> 02:12:47.753]  First, I just want to mention InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:12:47.773 --> 02:12:52.478]  Of course, you know that's what keeps us running, but I have a little different take on this.
[02:12:53.279 --> 02:13:01.027]  If you're not boosting your immune function and protecting yourself with the nutrients that Gary Haven mentioned about an hour ago, then you're crazy.
[02:13:01.567 --> 02:13:05.131]  Look, I think that right now we have, let's say, a 2% mortality rate.
[02:13:07.313 --> 02:13:08.454]  The WHO says it's 3.4%.
[02:13:08.494 --> 02:13:17.219]  The new numbers from worldometer.info now say it's a 6% death rate across the board.
[02:13:17.839 --> 02:13:18.360]  Maybe it's only 1%.
[02:13:19.861 --> 02:13:28.226]  But look, you're a lot less likely to die if you keep your immune function healthy and strong to begin with.
[02:13:28.866 --> 02:13:38.397]  And even though we don't know anything about what's proven against this particular coronavirus, we can of course have general principles of boosting our immune health.
[02:13:38.597 --> 02:13:40.359]  I take vitamin C every day.
[02:13:40.860 --> 02:13:41.821]  Massive amounts of it.
[02:13:42.121 --> 02:13:43.242]  I take vitamin D every day.
[02:13:43.943 --> 02:13:45.045]  I take magnesium and zinc.
[02:13:45.085 --> 02:13:48.009]  Those are the four nutrients that Gary Haven mentioned.
[02:13:48.630 --> 02:13:49.591]  But I take a lot more, too.
[02:13:49.651 --> 02:13:55.059]  I take turmeric, I take asaxanthin, I take spirulina, I take licorice root, and all kinds of other things.
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:57.282]  Alpha lipoic acid, for example.
[02:13:57.402 --> 02:13:59.225]  Ginger root is very helpful.
[02:14:00.246 --> 02:14:05.527]  InfoWarsTore.com has a lot of things that are generally supportive of your normal immune function.
[02:14:06.207 --> 02:14:12.468]  And I think you'd be crazy not to support this network and also boost your health in this time, even though, again, we don't know.
[02:14:13.468 --> 02:14:25.130]  Nothing has been scientifically proven against this virus, not any drug, not any pharmaceutical, not any herb or vaccine or anything, because it's still so early in this race, this race to find what works.
[02:14:26.491 --> 02:14:28.271]  But boosting immune function makes perfect sense.
[02:14:29.344 --> 02:14:31.068]  So, let's go to calls here.
[02:14:31.428 --> 02:14:37.821]  Now, I don't have the callers' names in front of me, so I apologize in advance to the callers, but we're going to go...
[02:14:38.789 --> 02:14:50.535]  We're going to go kind of rapid pace here shortly, but one other thing to mention before we go to calls, bring up the worldometer.info, or some people say worldometer.info.
[02:14:50.575 --> 02:15:03.261]  Go to the coronavirus page, show that chart, because it shows the rise in cases around the world, and it shows the current 6% death rate that is calculated from cases that are closed.
[02:15:03.641 --> 02:15:04.201]  So 94% of the people
[02:15:06.042 --> 02:15:27.358]  are discharged as survivors and six percent are dying now out of that hundred percent maybe four out of five people are roughly eighty percent maybe it's eighty five percent are having very mild cases but after you get beyond mild and you get into serious or critical status than the death rate skyrockets especially if you're an older individual
[02:15:28.078 --> 02:15:31.200]  If you're older than 60, your death rate on average is about 4%.
[02:15:32.301 --> 02:15:34.482]  If you're older than 70, it's about 8%.
[02:15:34.682 --> 02:15:37.324]  If you're older than 80, it's about 15 or 16%.
[02:15:38.584 --> 02:15:42.887]  Across the board, it's about 6% fatality, according to the current numbers.
[02:15:43.487 --> 02:15:50.952]  And as more numbers roll in from Italy and Korea and the United States, we're going to have even better accuracy on all those numbers.
[02:15:51.432 --> 02:15:52.453]  Here's what we know for sure.
[02:15:53.113 --> 02:15:54.053]  The more testing you do,
[02:15:55.054 --> 02:15:59.483]  The lower your death rate gets, because you get early treatment for people, you get good hospital care.
[02:16:00.498 --> 02:16:06.422]  So the United States needs to be testing like mad right now, and it still isn't happening at the pace that we need.
[02:16:06.963 --> 02:16:11.186]  South Korea has been leading the way on testing for the whole world.
[02:16:11.246 --> 02:16:14.088]  South Korea is an outstanding model for testing.
[02:16:14.388 --> 02:16:15.629]  They've got drive-through testing.
[02:16:16.090 --> 02:16:21.153]  They've done hundreds of thousands of tests, while America has only achieved a few thousand tests.
[02:16:21.534 --> 02:16:22.614]  That is unacceptable.
[02:16:23.235 --> 02:16:26.918]  We can't say that America is ready for a pandemic if we can't test for it.
[02:16:27.518 --> 02:16:31.180]  So, you know, all this talk out there that says, oh, America is great.
[02:16:31.200 --> 02:16:32.800]  It's the best health care system in the world.
[02:16:32.860 --> 02:16:34.021]  We were ready for the pandemic.
[02:16:34.601 --> 02:16:35.341]  Not at all true.
[02:16:35.681 --> 02:16:37.522]  Hospitals did not have masks.
[02:16:37.582 --> 02:16:38.943]  That's why they're scrambling to buy them.
[02:16:39.223 --> 02:16:40.183]  They did not have gear.
[02:16:40.944 --> 02:16:45.586]  Fire departments and police departments, first responders across the country did not have masks.
[02:16:45.686 --> 02:16:50.268]  I know this is a fact because I've spoken to many of the logistics people that order supplies.
[02:16:50.768 --> 02:16:52.028]  They did not have supplies.
[02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:53.369]  Hospitals weren't ready.
[02:16:53.849 --> 02:16:55.930]  Firefighters, their departments weren't ready.
[02:16:56.010 --> 02:16:56.891]  Counties weren't ready.
[02:16:56.991 --> 02:16:57.772]  Cities weren't ready.
[02:16:58.052 --> 02:16:58.952]  Hospitals weren't ready.
[02:16:58.972 --> 02:17:03.555]  And the CDC was the most of all not ready for this.
[02:17:03.675 --> 02:17:04.736]  And the FDA wasn't ready.
[02:17:04.796 --> 02:17:06.097]  The big pharma wasn't ready.
[02:17:06.617 --> 02:17:07.678]  The NIH wasn't ready.
[02:17:08.338 --> 02:17:10.540]  So no, no, we're way behind the curve on this.
[02:17:10.700 --> 02:17:13.742]  We should have been testing thousands of people a month ago.
[02:17:14.562 --> 02:17:15.043]  And we didn't.
[02:17:15.484 --> 02:17:18.790]  And as a result, this has slipped out of control right now.
[02:17:19.050 --> 02:17:22.096]  It's broken containment in areas like Seattle and Washington.
[02:17:22.457 --> 02:17:24.941]  And this is not going to get under control until we take new steps.
[02:17:25.562 --> 02:17:26.564]  Another important point here.
[02:17:27.842 --> 02:17:29.123]  Big Tech wants you to die.
[02:17:29.844 --> 02:17:32.186]  So Big Tech wants the population.
[02:17:32.546 --> 02:17:40.793]  They are censoring all the good information sources like us and InfoWars and Natural News and others, even Zero Hedge, you know, got shut down by Twitter.
[02:17:41.634 --> 02:17:41.954]  Why?
[02:17:42.014 --> 02:17:43.195]  Why are these sources being censored?
[02:17:43.235 --> 02:17:44.736]  Because Big Tech wants you to die.
[02:17:44.756 --> 02:17:49.400]  They don't want you to understand that there are things you can do to defend yourself, to protect yourself.
[02:17:49.721 --> 02:17:51.923]  They don't want you to know the truth about how serious this is.
[02:17:52.543 --> 02:17:54.384]  And they certainly don't want you buying masks.
[02:17:54.765 --> 02:17:58.807]  Facebook has banned ads for masks, which is insane.
[02:17:58.887 --> 02:17:59.348]  And the U.S.
[02:17:59.388 --> 02:18:02.470]  Surgeon General has said, stop buying masks.
[02:18:02.770 --> 02:18:04.931]  They don't work, says the Surgeon General.
[02:18:05.191 --> 02:18:08.834]  And then followed by, oh, we need them in the hospitals because they do work in the hospitals.
[02:18:09.134 --> 02:18:09.374]  Wow.
[02:18:09.414 --> 02:18:10.835]  Those are some really magical masks.
[02:18:11.135 --> 02:18:21.903]  It's like the magical passport from 9-11, you know, that was found on the sidewalk, somehow survived the massive explosion that brought down ultimately three buildings, but, you know, one one tower at a time.
[02:18:23.063 --> 02:18:27.925]  And this passport was found on the sidewalk, and they said, oh, this is the identity of one of the hijackers.
[02:18:27.965 --> 02:18:29.426]  Wow, that's a magical passport!
[02:18:30.066 --> 02:18:35.448]  Well, now we have magical masks that don't work when you wear them, but they do work when government bureaucrats wear them.
[02:18:36.508 --> 02:18:41.010]  So this level of insanity and disinformation is not going to help anybody.
[02:18:41.730 --> 02:18:49.253]  We need good, honest information, full transparency from the President, from Dr. Fauci, from the FDA, from the CDC right now.
[02:18:49.653 --> 02:18:56.376]  And if we don't get good, honest information, Trump should fire everybody who is lying to America, starting with the head of the CDC.
[02:18:56.636 --> 02:19:01.878]  Now, I gotta say, Dr. Fauci has been saying some very transparent things lately.
[02:19:02.981 --> 02:19:07.184]  Just this morning, I believe, Dr. Fauci said, we've only just begun to see this.
[02:19:07.284 --> 02:19:09.065]  This is only the beginning, I think, were his words.
[02:19:09.485 --> 02:19:10.305]  So that's accurate.
[02:19:10.886 --> 02:19:12.867]  Thank you, Dr. Fauci, for saying that.
[02:19:13.147 --> 02:19:14.148]  He knows where this is going.
[02:19:14.688 --> 02:19:18.230]  But the CDC has been lying to people, or at least some people in the CDC.
[02:19:18.570 --> 02:19:24.774]  There's still Dr. Nancy Messonnier, who, from time to time, says something that's incredibly accurate and true.
[02:19:25.275 --> 02:19:27.276]  But then she gets accused of being a fearmonger.
[02:19:27.916 --> 02:19:30.817]  When she says, hey, this is coming, you better get the schools ready.
[02:19:30.837 --> 02:19:31.997]  You better get the hospitals ready.
[02:19:32.417 --> 02:19:32.997]  This is coming.
[02:19:33.437 --> 02:19:34.337]  She's not wrong about that.
[02:19:34.937 --> 02:19:39.398]  So, you know, we've got to be able to sort out truth from non-truth.
[02:19:39.418 --> 02:19:39.798]  But let's go.
[02:19:39.818 --> 02:19:41.278]  We've got a couple minutes left.
[02:19:41.599 --> 02:19:43.219]  Let's go to a caller right now.
[02:19:43.339 --> 02:19:46.139]  I'm sorry, I don't know your name, but you're live here with Mike Adams.
[02:19:46.719 --> 02:19:48.000]  Go ahead with your question or comment.
[02:19:48.740 --> 02:19:50.560]  Victor in Europe, I believe.
[02:19:50.600 --> 02:19:51.180]  Go ahead, Victor.
[02:19:51.200 --> 02:19:55.161]  I just want to mention how the vaccine, there won't be
[02:19:56.228 --> 02:20:01.373]  A vaccine that will actually work because there's too many mutations, just like the common cold.
[02:20:02.113 --> 02:20:14.263]  And some of the studies that I've read about say that if you get a vaccine for a particular, you know, they have to predict what type of the mutation will be occurring in the future.
[02:20:14.884 --> 02:20:18.227]  And by the time that future comes around, it's usually not valid.
[02:20:18.787 --> 02:20:21.970]  And then the mutations that aren't included in the vaccine
[02:20:22.546 --> 02:20:25.968]  We'll actually be more, make the person more susceptible.
[02:20:26.549 --> 02:20:27.369]  That's number one.
[02:20:28.270 --> 02:20:39.338]  And then number two, I've read that some of these test kits actually give some false positives and false negatives and I can't hear you.
[02:20:40.325 --> 02:20:41.426]  No, you're absolutely right.
[02:20:41.466 --> 02:20:42.648]  Everything you've said is right on.
[02:20:43.128 --> 02:20:45.170]  The vaccine will probably not work.
[02:20:45.471 --> 02:20:46.712]  We can't rely on the vaccine.
[02:20:47.072 --> 02:20:57.443]  You're correct in saying that the test kits that were originally sent out by the CDC on February 5th, they gave false positives and false negatives, but the CDC told everybody stop using those kits.
[02:20:58.044 --> 02:21:00.306]  So those kits have since been replaced.
[02:21:00.646 --> 02:21:03.208]  It was a problem with the chemical reagents that were in those kits.
[02:21:03.568 --> 02:21:06.610]  So the new kits that have gone out are now accurate.
[02:21:06.970 --> 02:21:07.911]  That's my understanding.
[02:21:08.351 --> 02:21:17.617]  And they're being, see what's happening is the test kits in the local cities are being done and then samples are being sent to the CDC for genetic confirmation of the testing.
[02:21:17.898 --> 02:21:19.379]  So you have two stages of testing.
[02:21:19.819 --> 02:21:22.441]  Local hospital does an instant test, which is maybe
[02:21:22.921 --> 02:21:28.746]  I'm guessing 98, 99% accurate, and then the CDC confirms it with their gene sequencing analyzers.
[02:21:29.507 --> 02:21:30.828]  And then that's a confirmed case.
[02:21:31.209 --> 02:21:35.753]  So my belief right now, and it's a great point, caller.
[02:21:35.813 --> 02:21:36.413]  Thank you, Victor.
[02:21:36.613 --> 02:21:37.915]  Thank you for asking those questions.
[02:21:38.315 --> 02:21:40.797]  My assessment right now is that the tests are accurate now.
[02:21:41.738 --> 02:21:47.301]  But they were delayed on purpose to allow the virus to spread across America.
[02:21:47.701 --> 02:21:54.224]  So now we're going to see thousands of cases confirmed in America over the next two to three weeks.
[02:21:54.324 --> 02:21:55.044]  That's what's coming.
[02:21:55.565 --> 02:21:56.945]  More of your calls straight ahead.
[02:21:56.965 --> 02:22:00.127]  This is Mike Adams here on InfoWars.com, the Alex Jones Show.
[02:22:00.807 --> 02:22:02.628]  We've got callers lined up with questions and comments.
[02:22:02.768 --> 02:22:04.649]  We'll be back with all that and much more.
[02:22:06.348 --> 02:22:07.349]  Okay, this is Mike Adams here.
[02:22:07.369 --> 02:22:10.572]  We're going to continue with calls in just a minute, but we've got some breaking news.
[02:22:11.292 --> 02:22:21.161]  Reportedly, President Trump is now considering making a national emergency declaration under the Stafford Act, which would free up new money for FEMA.
[02:22:21.721 --> 02:22:24.624]  So we would start to see funding for FEMA nationwide.
[02:22:24.644 --> 02:22:25.985]  Perhaps FEMA would be setting up
[02:22:27.006 --> 02:22:31.488]  Well, happy fun camps that Hillary Clinton used to describe them.
[02:22:32.288 --> 02:22:37.410]  Look, I suppose FEMA is going to end up running quarantine centers across America.
[02:22:38.130 --> 02:22:39.011]  Just imagine that.
[02:22:39.871 --> 02:22:42.832]  Do you have to turn in your AR-15 to go to a FEMA camp?
[02:22:43.032 --> 02:22:43.992]  I have no idea.
[02:22:44.493 --> 02:22:45.593]  We'll have to see where that goes.
[02:22:45.913 --> 02:22:50.735]  But look, on another note, I want to say as a Trump supporter, as a patriot,
[02:22:51.929 --> 02:22:59.134]  We want a strong response that respects the Constitution, but that stops this virus.
[02:22:59.875 --> 02:23:10.703]  We the people, at least I think most patriots would agree with me, we're not going to be causing trouble out there if Trump announces a national declaration, an emergency declaration.
[02:23:11.103 --> 02:23:13.345]  We support stopping this virus quickly.
[02:23:13.425 --> 02:23:19.850]  We would support National Guard troops if they're helping with testing, like Stuart Rhodes was talking about.
[02:23:19.890 --> 02:23:20.651]  We would support
[02:23:21.431 --> 02:23:25.773]  These troops in a health care or emergency medicine type of context.
[02:23:26.333 --> 02:23:30.254]  What we absolutely will resist is gun confiscation, just so you know.
[02:23:30.615 --> 02:23:34.336]  That's not going to fly anywhere, anywhere that I can think of.
[02:23:34.736 --> 02:23:37.197]  So yeah, we support a national response.
[02:23:37.217 --> 02:23:39.078]  We support the emergency declaration.
[02:23:39.138 --> 02:23:40.098]  We support health care.
[02:23:40.358 --> 02:23:41.139]  We support testing.
[02:23:41.159 --> 02:23:44.400]  We support the quarantining of individuals who are infected.
[02:23:45.498 --> 02:23:48.480]  If it's done in a way that respects their civil liberties and human rights.
[02:23:48.980 --> 02:23:54.503]  We absolutely do not support the censorship that's taking place right now and any assaults on our Second Amendment.
[02:23:54.903 --> 02:23:55.344]  Forget it.
[02:23:56.084 --> 02:24:00.427]  We will fight to defend the Second Amendment.
[02:24:01.227 --> 02:24:07.272]  No matter what, and let me be just totally clear, no ambiguity about that.
[02:24:07.372 --> 02:24:12.536]  We will never give up our Second Amendment rights, not under any emergency, not under any circumstances.
[02:24:13.076 --> 02:24:20.062]  So the governor of Texas, I know, will hear that message loud and clear, and he supports the Second Amendment, and Trump needs to hear that message loud and clear.
[02:24:20.442 --> 02:24:23.744]  Don't come for our guns, or you're going to have a pandemic and
[02:24:24.745 --> 02:24:26.046]  Other problems on your hands.
[02:24:26.146 --> 02:24:26.967]  I'll just put it that way.
[02:24:27.007 --> 02:24:31.271]  So, respect the Second Amendment, respect the Constitution, but let's beat this virus.
[02:24:31.331 --> 02:24:34.354]  Okay, let's go to Chris in Washington.
[02:24:35.435 --> 02:24:37.176]  Chris, yeah, I think Chris is on the line.
[02:24:37.216 --> 02:24:38.357]  I think I've got the name right.
[02:24:38.397 --> 02:24:39.999]  Chris, welcome to the show.
[02:24:41.060 --> 02:24:42.541]  Yeah, thanks, Mike.
[02:24:42.821 --> 02:24:43.802]  Appreciate it.
[02:24:43.822 --> 02:24:45.744]  It's great to talk to somebody with your expertise.
[02:24:46.556 --> 02:24:48.137]  You know, I just have a quick question.
[02:24:48.357 --> 02:24:56.841]  I wonder why the suppression all the way up to, I support Trump and I've been a Trump supporter since the minute he started.
[02:24:58.141 --> 02:25:00.923]  I don't understand why he, I mean, I understand panic.
[02:25:01.263 --> 02:25:02.043]  I get that point.
[02:25:02.223 --> 02:25:10.647]  But from your perspective, why is he letting the CDC suppress the amount of tests that have actually been done?
[02:25:10.787 --> 02:25:13.729]  Like you've said, there's a huge suppression being done.
[02:25:16.513 --> 02:25:31.912]  Well I think they did it behind his back and they did it to try to hurt Trump and he did not get ahead of it quickly enough because I believe Trump wants to protect the stock market because he's tied his re-election to the stock market very strongly.
[02:25:31.992 --> 02:25:34.415]  Does that make sense to you?
[02:25:35.295 --> 02:25:36.276]  It does make sense.
[02:25:36.376 --> 02:25:37.317]  It makes sense a lot.
[02:25:37.657 --> 02:25:39.158]  I just don't see how they could do it.
[02:25:39.258 --> 02:25:41.100]  I mean, I'm not even a smart guy.
[02:25:41.320 --> 02:25:42.161]  I know you're smart.
[02:25:42.261 --> 02:25:43.141]  I know he's smart.
[02:25:43.542 --> 02:25:49.186]  I don't claim to be smart, but I'm smart enough to see that there's a huge suppression by the CDC.
[02:25:49.626 --> 02:25:55.871]  I mean, you can go to their website and see they've only done, what, twenty-some hundred tests in the whole country.
[02:25:56.886 --> 02:26:00.607]  Well, you're smart enough to question the lies of the establishment.
[02:26:00.627 --> 02:26:03.167]  That makes you smarter than about 90% of the country, by the way.
[02:26:03.507 --> 02:26:05.628]  So consider yourself in the top 10% right there.
[02:26:05.948 --> 02:26:08.948]  Look, the stupid people are the ones who just believe the system.
[02:26:09.449 --> 02:26:12.629]  And they're just waiting around for a vaccine that may never come and may never work.
[02:26:12.689 --> 02:26:14.090]  But you're exactly on point.
[02:26:14.130 --> 02:26:15.450]  Thank you there for your call, Chris.
[02:26:15.750 --> 02:26:17.830]  Let's go to Jason in Texas.
[02:26:18.250 --> 02:26:19.571]  Jason, you're on the air with Mike Adams.
[02:26:19.611 --> 02:26:21.011]  Go ahead with your comment or question, please.
[02:26:22.375 --> 02:26:22.935]  Hello, Mike.
[02:26:23.196 --> 02:26:24.797]  Thank you for taking my call.
[02:26:25.257 --> 02:26:42.948]  Just wanted to see if you had also heard about the Houston Rodeo being canceled, which is unprecedented in the city, because one of the people that were possibly infected in Montgomery County, which is about 40 miles outside of Houston, attended the barbecue festival.
[02:26:43.969 --> 02:26:45.272]  Do you want to make that comment?
[02:26:45.973 --> 02:26:49.979]  No, I had not heard that that was confirmed, but I'm certainly not surprised to hear that.
[02:26:50.019 --> 02:26:52.143]  So you're saying you've got confirmation that it's been cancelled?
[02:26:53.186 --> 02:26:56.227]  Yes, what they're doing is actually shutting things down at 4 p.m.
[02:26:56.307 --> 02:26:56.787]  on today.
[02:26:56.807 --> 02:27:02.529]  They're letting everybody finish their event, so this is equivalent to the South by Southwest being canceled.
[02:27:02.789 --> 02:27:03.109]  Wow.
[02:27:03.189 --> 02:27:08.771]  Houston, by the end of the day, will be declaring a state of emergency for the city for seven days.
[02:27:09.391 --> 02:27:17.574]  They're also getting ready to cancel the tour to Houston, which is coming up next week as well.
[02:27:17.914 --> 02:27:20.955]  I do want to make one more comment, if I can.
[02:27:20.975 --> 02:27:22.035]  Yes, go ahead, Jason.
[02:27:23.330 --> 02:27:29.793]  Yes, I appreciate you and Stuart Rose coming out and saying what the people need to hear.
[02:27:30.393 --> 02:27:41.717]  I did want to say to the listeners, and I've been a listener for 10 years, that we need to get our mind off of Trump right now and get our mind on Jesus Christ and protecting our families.
[02:27:42.397 --> 02:27:48.559]  Because us talking about Trump and how they're trying to attack him is not going to stop what's already inevitable.
[02:27:50.419 --> 02:27:57.228]  At this point, it could be a distraction on us preparing ourselves for something that is not could be coming, but can.
[02:27:57.828 --> 02:28:00.872]  Also, I want to say to the listeners, look at Exodus 12.
[02:28:01.593 --> 02:28:08.722]  And I know this is not a religious program, but it comes a time when we have to get our mind off of people and start looking at survival.
[02:28:09.429 --> 02:28:16.392]  And there is a survival mechanism in us that causes us to reach out after something higher than us, that is God.
[02:28:16.452 --> 02:28:24.895]  So I do want to say, tell your listeners, if they can, look at Exodus 12 and look at the similarities of what we need to be doing in our own homes.
[02:28:24.955 --> 02:28:26.276]  And I appreciate you taking my call.
[02:28:26.758 --> 02:28:36.022]  Well, Jason, blessings to you, and the reason I didn't interrupt you is because I think your message is absolutely critical for this time, and I agree with you.
[02:28:36.602 --> 02:28:47.147]  You better get right with Jesus Christ, and you better learn from history that has been described, sometimes in advance, in the Bible.
[02:28:47.968 --> 02:28:50.249]  We are looking at times that
[02:28:51.189 --> 02:28:52.930]  Perhaps have already been described in the Bible.
[02:28:52.950 --> 02:28:55.332]  I mean, I know a lot of different interpretations are out there.
[02:28:55.392 --> 02:28:59.114]  I'm not a Bible scholar, but you're absolutely right to point that out, Jason.
[02:28:59.174 --> 02:29:01.835]  Thank you so much for that important message for our time.
[02:29:02.336 --> 02:29:04.897]  I'm not even sure Trump will survive this as president, by the way.
[02:29:05.378 --> 02:29:07.399]  I'm not sure America will survive it, but you know what?
[02:29:08.584 --> 02:29:18.768]  Your spirit will survive, and what you do with your spirit and with your creator, that absolutely matters regardless of what happens with our material world or our geopolitical world.
[02:29:19.268 --> 02:29:20.908]  Let's go to Vincent in Illinois.
[02:29:20.948 --> 02:29:22.329]  Vincent, we've got about a minute left.
[02:29:22.769 --> 02:29:26.030]  Sorry to keep it short for you, but go ahead with your comment or question, please.
[02:29:26.290 --> 02:29:27.011]  How much time left?
[02:29:27.931 --> 02:29:29.651]  We've got about a minute, so go ahead.
[02:29:29.671 --> 02:29:33.893]  First of all, thank you so much for all you have done for humanity, okay?
[02:29:34.697 --> 02:29:37.939]  You're probably one of the most brilliant persons I've ever come across.
[02:29:37.980 --> 02:29:38.520]  That's number one.
[02:29:38.560 --> 02:29:42.122]  Number two, I'm out of Chicago here, or close to Chicago.
[02:29:42.303 --> 02:29:46.906]  WGN, bad mouth your website, call them up and scold them pretty bad.
[02:29:46.946 --> 02:29:49.768]  Number three, I want some information about my children.
[02:29:49.948 --> 02:29:53.750]  One of my sons lives in Atlanta, Georgia, thinking about flying.
[02:29:54.211 --> 02:30:00.575]  My daughter works at a restaurant in Chicago, many restaurants, and I'm worried that she should quit that job.
[02:30:01.176 --> 02:30:02.817]  But anyway, give me some advice.
[02:30:03.717 --> 02:30:04.638]  All right, I sure will.
[02:30:05.018 --> 02:30:06.780]  And thank you for your call, Vincent, and for your question.
[02:30:06.841 --> 02:30:12.827]  So I'm going to answer your question on the other side of this break that's coming right up here in a few seconds.
[02:30:13.228 --> 02:30:22.378]  As I understand it, your question is about, you've got family members working in the food industry, restaurant industry, and you're wondering what advice should they be hearing right now.
[02:30:22.958 --> 02:30:23.899]  The short answer is,
[02:30:25.287 --> 02:30:31.073]  There will probably be lockdowns coming from local and state governments very soon.
[02:30:31.153 --> 02:30:33.235]  So we'll get into that more on the other side of this break.
[02:30:33.595 --> 02:30:35.237]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger here.
[02:30:35.697 --> 02:30:36.198]  Stay with us.
[02:30:36.558 --> 02:30:37.299]  Much more straight ahead.
[02:30:38.996 --> 02:30:40.876]  So we have a lot of great callers lined up for you.
[02:30:40.896 --> 02:30:42.297]  We're going to go to more calls in a second.
[02:30:42.317 --> 02:30:46.678]  I just want to finish answering the question from Vincent in the last segment.
[02:30:46.698 --> 02:30:50.358]  He was asking about, he's got family members who work in the restaurant industry.
[02:30:50.898 --> 02:30:53.759]  Should they be self-quarantining at this time?
[02:30:55.239 --> 02:30:57.880]  Honestly, it depends on a lot of your personal situation.
[02:30:58.080 --> 02:31:08.362]  If you have an elderly person at home who has pre-existing medical conditions, then there is a very high risk of their fatality if you were to bring an infection home.
[02:31:09.617 --> 02:31:19.644]  Even if you yourself as maybe a younger person working in the restaurant, or I think this caller said his daughter was working in the restaurant, maybe that person wouldn't have any problem with this virus.
[02:31:20.044 --> 02:31:21.245]  Most people do survive.
[02:31:21.325 --> 02:31:27.509]  Currently 94% survive globally according to the worldometer.info website.
[02:31:28.109 --> 02:31:41.134]  But if you've got an elderly person around or someone who's compromised with respiratory dysfunction or high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease is also another co-factor for mortality risk.
[02:31:41.494 --> 02:31:47.537]  So think about that and also remember that you can use antivirals to boost your immune function.
[02:31:47.577 --> 02:31:48.097]  You can use
[02:31:48.797 --> 02:31:57.863]  Like Gary Haven mentioned an hour ago, vitamin C, vitamin D3, magnesium and zinc, he mentioned as things for just general immune boosting.
[02:31:58.343 --> 02:31:59.204]  So let's go to more calls.
[02:31:59.224 --> 02:32:00.604]  We've got a lot of great callers lined up.
[02:32:00.684 --> 02:32:02.165]  John in Virginia.
[02:32:02.686 --> 02:32:04.127]  John, you're on the air with Mike Adams.
[02:32:04.167 --> 02:32:06.028]  Go ahead, sir, with your question or comment.
[02:32:06.889 --> 02:32:10.593]  Hey Mike, I'm actually a first-time listener of the Alex Jones Show.
[02:32:10.633 --> 02:32:13.056]  I actually was listening to the War Room.
[02:32:13.276 --> 02:32:19.382]  Oh, I started listening as early as this week, so it's good to hear some different perspectives.
[02:32:21.164 --> 02:32:22.365]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:32:22.505 --> 02:32:25.449]  Well, that's because InfoWars is real, you know.
[02:32:25.529 --> 02:32:28.332]  People do, different guests have different perspectives for sure.
[02:32:28.352 --> 02:32:29.373]  But yeah, go ahead with your question.
[02:32:30.103 --> 02:32:46.629]  Yeah, so currently I'm undecided for 2020, but looking ahead to 2024, I think a lot of this with the coronavirus has people like AOC, who could very well run for president in 2024, say, this is a reason why we need, like, Medicare for All.
[02:32:46.689 --> 02:32:50.370]  So I just wanted to know what you would say to someone like that.
[02:32:50.430 --> 02:32:57.573]  And also, should we be concerned about a potential AOC running for president in four years, potentially?
[02:32:58.996 --> 02:33:00.577]  Okay, that's a legit question.
[02:33:00.597 --> 02:33:05.859]  I would say first we have to survive as a nation the next year and this coming election.
[02:33:06.740 --> 02:33:08.921]  I think we're facing a very dire situation.
[02:33:08.961 --> 02:33:12.543]  I'm not even sure elections will take place on schedule this November.
[02:33:13.663 --> 02:33:14.704]  So looking ahead to 2024 is pretty...
[02:33:17.825 --> 02:33:20.927]  Pretty far away right now, given the crisis of what we have right now.
[02:33:21.447 --> 02:33:30.612]  AOC, I think, is not a viable candidate once she gets the level of scrutiny that would be applied to her.
[02:33:30.992 --> 02:33:35.675]  You know, in the same way that Joe Biden is not a viable candidate either, even though he may be the nominee.
[02:33:36.235 --> 02:33:37.716]  Once people start looking at Joe Biden,
[02:33:38.396 --> 02:33:41.438]  They just see a senile old fool.
[02:33:42.179 --> 02:33:47.182]  And with AOC, you know, that level of scrutiny, she's not going to be able to deal with it very well.
[02:33:47.443 --> 02:33:48.243]  Not saying she won't run.
[02:33:48.283 --> 02:33:49.244]  You're probably right about that.
[02:33:49.344 --> 02:33:50.285]  She could definitely run.
[02:33:50.565 --> 02:33:52.927]  Maybe another round for Pete Buttigieg as well.
[02:33:53.787 --> 02:34:00.430]  But that assumes we have a functioning United States of America by the time 2024 rolls around.
[02:34:00.631 --> 02:34:01.691]  I'm not even sure we're going to get there.
[02:34:01.711 --> 02:34:05.133]  But thank you for your call and thank you for being a new listener and for your comments there, John.
[02:34:05.493 --> 02:34:07.374]  Let's go to Johnny in Denmark.
[02:34:07.754 --> 02:34:09.235]  Get an international caller in here.
[02:34:09.295 --> 02:34:11.296]  Johnny, you're on the air with Mike Adams.
[02:34:11.336 --> 02:34:12.096]  Welcome to the show.
[02:34:12.476 --> 02:34:13.337]  Go ahead with your comments.
[02:34:14.997 --> 02:34:15.517]  Hi again, Mike.
[02:34:15.557 --> 02:34:16.898]  I don't know if you remember me from last time.
[02:34:17.339 --> 02:34:19.480]  Congratulations for being part of the top team.
[02:34:19.580 --> 02:34:24.163]  In the interest of time, I'm going to just kind of read some notes if you want to focus on them.
[02:34:24.861 --> 02:34:26.202]  I'll be happy to elaborate on them.
[02:34:26.662 --> 02:34:42.591]  But basically, by conscientiously and critically listening to, reading, and watching for about 12 hours a day now, for about the last two months, authoritative sources including, but not limited to, the X-22 report, which isn't as strong as InfoWars, but then again, who is?
[02:34:43.311 --> 02:34:47.273]  You, especially Professor Dr. Francis A. Boyle,
[02:34:49.553 --> 02:35:05.257]  Professor Dr. Richard E. Gordon, whom you might not know, but he's a now decade-distinguished Hippocratic and integrative doctor, GP, and professor in Ohio.
[02:35:06.257 --> 02:35:08.758]  A really good guy in the spirit of Hippocrates and Galen.
[02:35:08.778 --> 02:35:09.958]  So what are your conclusions then?
[02:35:09.998 --> 02:35:11.258]  You've been listening to all these people.
[02:35:11.778 --> 02:35:12.898]  What's your uptake?
[02:35:13.799 --> 02:35:14.919]  The upshot, so to speak.
[02:35:15.518 --> 02:35:15.778]  Right.
[02:35:16.158 --> 02:35:32.669]  The upshot right now, and I've gone back and forth on this, but the answer is, I have two things to say about that, is it's obviously scientifically irreputable that it's a genetically engineered bioweapon in conjunction with some corrupt American scientist.
[02:35:32.689 --> 02:35:33.609]  There's no doubt about that.
[02:35:33.729 --> 02:35:34.030]  Absolutely.
[02:35:35.645 --> 02:35:42.989]  I've gone the other way as you in terms of intentionality, because I think it was prematurely released.
[02:35:43.829 --> 02:35:50.012]  And the reason is because they have gone to such extremes in trying to
[02:35:52.328 --> 02:35:52.909]  All right.
[02:36:07.744 --> 02:36:08.385]  I think so.
[02:36:22.859 --> 02:36:28.843]  Um, so for example, one way in which they spread it is by telling people, oh you're okay if you're quarantined for 14 days.
[02:36:29.383 --> 02:36:39.250]  And it's true, 97.5% of the cases are, it is incubated within 14 days, but we know it's at least 27 days, and who knows what it is at the outer end.
[02:36:39.790 --> 02:36:44.752]  Do you think, Johnny, that it's going to mutate to a less lethal form?
[02:36:44.772 --> 02:36:51.476]  Because right now, at 6%, that's about 60 times more mortality than the seasonal flu.
[02:36:51.496 --> 02:36:54.077]  Do you think it's going to mutate to become less lethal?
[02:36:55.238 --> 02:37:02.041]  I think that 6% figure is a statistical artifact based on a denominator problem.
[02:37:02.681 --> 02:37:08.384]  Basically, everyone who's died from it, or almost everyone who's died from it, has been identified as dying from it.
[02:37:08.835 --> 02:37:08.995]  Yes.
[02:37:09.015 --> 02:37:09.196]  Yes.
[02:37:22.904 --> 02:37:23.585]  I think so.
[02:37:51.708 --> 02:38:01.014]  And I also have a list that I compiled of 13 NWO goals, and they've largely been things I've compiled from InfoWars.
[02:38:01.874 --> 02:38:14.682]  Well, Johnny, look, first of all, I want to say thank you for your point, and I appreciate the fact that you're approaching this from a mathematical argument, and that it's a rational point that you're making right now.
[02:38:14.843 --> 02:38:16.764]  You may end up being correct about this.
[02:38:18.105 --> 02:38:27.951]  I want to go to more callers, so I don't have time to get into all your 13 points, but I do appreciate the fact that you're thinking for yourself, you're doing your own numbers, you're reaching your own conclusions, and I hope you're right.
[02:38:28.311 --> 02:38:31.493]  I hope that this ends up being a lot less lethal than even 2%.
[02:38:35.035 --> 02:38:36.796]  So far, maybe it's too early to tell.
[02:38:37.016 --> 02:38:38.876]  When more testing gets done in America, we'll know more.
[02:38:39.156 --> 02:38:44.298]  So, Johnny, I'm sorry to cut you off, but I do want to give other callers a chance to ask their questions and give their comments.
[02:38:44.318 --> 02:38:45.698]  They might agree with you, they might disagree.
[02:38:45.979 --> 02:38:49.420]  Let's go to Ed in Utah and see what Ed's take is on this.
[02:38:49.980 --> 02:38:51.020]  Ed, you're live with Mike Adams.
[02:38:51.060 --> 02:38:51.380]  Go ahead.
[02:38:52.081 --> 02:38:53.081]  Hey, thanks a lot, Mike.
[02:38:53.101 --> 02:38:55.802]  Appreciate you and all you've done for all of us out here in the world.
[02:38:56.882 --> 02:38:59.723]  I am wondering about grapeseed oil extract.
[02:38:59.883 --> 02:39:02.644]  I've heard that that's a real powerful virus killer.
[02:39:03.394 --> 02:39:06.295]  Or maybe it's grape seed extract, not the oil.
[02:39:06.775 --> 02:39:07.375]  Yeah, you're right.
[02:39:07.775 --> 02:39:15.516]  It's GSE is how it's typically known, and it is used in cosmetics, for example, and some dietary supplements for its antibacterial properties.
[02:39:16.196 --> 02:39:19.377]  But I don't know that that translates into antiviral properties.
[02:39:20.497 --> 02:39:26.938]  GSE is, it's potent, you know, it tastes very, very tart, you know, if you taste it.
[02:39:28.118 --> 02:39:31.859]  I would put that on the candidates list of something that might work, but probably too early to tell.
[02:39:32.913 --> 02:39:33.173]  Okay.
[02:39:33.613 --> 02:39:33.853]  All right.
[02:39:33.893 --> 02:39:34.593]  That's my question.
[02:39:34.613 --> 02:39:35.573]  I appreciate your show.
[02:39:36.154 --> 02:39:36.394]  Okay.
[02:39:36.514 --> 02:39:36.774]  Awesome.
[02:39:36.934 --> 02:39:37.394]  Thank you, Ed.
[02:39:37.774 --> 02:39:39.074]  And now we're going to go to break.
[02:39:39.334 --> 02:39:42.255]  And in the segment after this, we're going to go to other callers.
[02:39:42.295 --> 02:39:46.295]  Jordan, Heath, Chris, Greg, Monica, Debbie, perhaps others.
[02:39:46.855 --> 02:39:47.816]  A lot of great calls today.
[02:39:47.836 --> 02:39:51.056]  A lot of different views and analyses taking place.
[02:39:51.076 --> 02:39:52.817]  That's what's awesome about this show.
[02:39:53.117 --> 02:39:55.497]  This is Mike Adams here for the Alex Jones Show.
[02:39:55.917 --> 02:39:56.557]  Fourth hour today.
[02:39:56.657 --> 02:39:57.717]  One more segment ahead.
[02:39:58.117 --> 02:39:59.358]  Your calls straight ahead.
[02:39:59.378 --> 02:39:59.818]  Stay with us.
[02:39:59.958 --> 02:40:00.678]  We'll be back with more.
[02:40:02.449 --> 02:40:06.332]  All right, coming to you from Central Texas in my quarantine studio.
[02:40:06.392 --> 02:40:11.155]  Now, I am self-quarantined, and that's not a joke, and it's not an attack on Trump.
[02:40:11.455 --> 02:40:13.897]  It's actual, it's just common sense.
[02:40:14.337 --> 02:40:18.480]  Now, I do understand that the Democrats want to use this to hurt Trump.
[02:40:19.021 --> 02:40:20.061]  They want it to be bad.
[02:40:20.522 --> 02:40:21.763]  They want to crash the U.S.
[02:40:21.823 --> 02:40:22.343]  economy.
[02:40:22.923 --> 02:40:24.324]  They want Trump to fail.
[02:40:24.945 --> 02:40:30.389]  But all of those facts of what the Democrats want, that does not mean that this virus isn't real.
[02:40:31.189 --> 02:40:37.875]  It's like I shared with Alex in the studio, I don't know, Saturday or Sunday, whatever it was, I said, look, you look at 9-11.
[02:40:39.016 --> 02:40:41.838]  The first two towers were really hit by airplanes.
[02:40:41.898 --> 02:40:43.940]  Those were real planes, not holograms.
[02:40:44.400 --> 02:40:45.641]  The two towers came down.
[02:40:46.542 --> 02:40:53.185]  And then the globalists, they used demolition to bring down the third building, WTC7, because they had pre-planned it.
[02:40:53.265 --> 02:41:00.668]  It was an engineered event, and then they rolled out expanded surveillance and Patriot Act powers to spy on, well, in the future, Trump.
[02:41:01.488 --> 02:41:01.768]  We're good.
[02:41:17.930 --> 02:41:23.231]  Global-scale events of depopulation, the destruction of Trump, and the destruction of America.
[02:41:23.551 --> 02:41:24.891]  So don't think this isn't real.
[02:41:25.272 --> 02:41:25.772]  It's real.
[02:41:26.212 --> 02:41:33.973]  But the globalists will use it to try to destroy the rising patriotism and nationalism of pro-Trump America.
[02:41:34.273 --> 02:41:35.134]  That's my take on it.
[02:41:35.394 --> 02:41:36.514]  Let's continue with callers.
[02:41:36.554 --> 02:41:38.594]  Let's go to Jordan in Oregon.
[02:41:38.694 --> 02:41:40.075]  Jordan, you're live with Mike Adams.
[02:41:40.575 --> 02:41:41.815]  Go ahead with your comment or question.
[02:41:43.695 --> 02:41:44.515]  Hey, Mike.
[02:41:44.595 --> 02:41:45.796]  Long-time follower of you.
[02:41:45.836 --> 02:41:46.956]  Really appreciate your work.
[02:41:47.638 --> 02:41:47.978]  Thank you.
[02:41:48.018 --> 02:41:50.100]  I wanted to touch on something before I get into my point.
[02:41:50.860 --> 02:41:55.383]  Johnny the Caller says that if we would have tested more people, the kill rate would be much lower.
[02:41:55.403 --> 02:42:02.088]  I disagree, because they didn't test a lot of people that probably died of the coronavirus, that had pneumonia or whatever in the hospitals.
[02:42:02.728 --> 02:42:03.289]  Correct.
[02:42:03.349 --> 02:42:05.750]  Yeah, I'm glad you pointed that out.
[02:42:06.211 --> 02:42:10.774]  A lot of people have died across America right now, and they're labeled pneumonia, not coronavirus.
[02:42:10.794 --> 02:42:11.814]  So you're correct about that point.
[02:42:13.095 --> 02:42:13.515]  Exactly.
[02:42:13.555 --> 02:42:14.616]  That nullifies that point.
[02:42:14.976 --> 02:42:17.198]  Now, we need to throw a wrench in the gears of the globalists.
[02:42:17.705 --> 02:42:22.847]  I'm in agreement with 99% of you, Gary and Stuart, and I'm also in agreement with Alex and Owen.
[02:42:23.667 --> 02:42:39.992]  One of the points that Alex and Owen would have would, well, they've already harvested this bioweapon, so if we allow them to shut down America without there being justice and going after the people that caused this problem, then all they have to do is release a bioweapon every year and shut down America.
[02:42:40.012 --> 02:42:40.052]  No.
[02:42:41.604 --> 02:42:45.027]  To add to that, the deep states are already three steps ahead of us.
[02:42:45.067 --> 02:42:49.411]  While we spend all this time exposing what they've done, they've already got the next 9-11.
[02:42:49.671 --> 02:42:52.353]  They're going to tell Trump, launch a bioweapon, drop a nuke.
[02:42:52.773 --> 02:42:54.375]  We can't absorb their attacks.
[02:42:54.395 --> 02:42:55.796]  We've got to get ahead of them, Mike.
[02:42:56.316 --> 02:43:06.565]  Now, the way Trump can do this, if he can come out with the proof in the documents that Obama released the virus to China, China released it intentionally or accidentally.
[02:43:06.585 --> 02:43:08.026]  It takes the blame off Trump.
[02:43:08.387 --> 02:43:09.988]  It puts the focus on the guilty.
[02:43:10.600 --> 02:43:17.166]  Now, a way to cure the virus and the deep state is to quarantine America, like you're saying.
[02:43:17.506 --> 02:43:22.250]  But at the same time, if we're going to give up our rights, we need to quarantine the deep state, the people that are guilty.
[02:43:22.551 --> 02:43:25.934]  We need to have extreme risk people, high risk people, medium risk people.
[02:43:26.314 --> 02:43:27.935]  The military needs to round them up.
[02:43:28.336 --> 02:43:33.300]  If we're all going to give up our rights and let them crash our economy, then we need to stop them from doing it again.
[02:43:33.620 --> 02:43:35.342]  They're going to release another bioweapon.
[02:43:35.382 --> 02:43:37.344]  We have to realize that and come to that point.
[02:43:38.171 --> 02:43:39.772]  Jordan, it's like you're reading my mind.
[02:43:39.972 --> 02:43:40.972]  What a great caller.
[02:43:41.133 --> 02:43:44.234]  And by the way, I'm going to let you speak some more here, Jordan, but just some quick comments.
[02:43:44.694 --> 02:43:50.678]  I actually had notes here that said, I meant to cover this, that this is just a softening up operation.
[02:43:50.978 --> 02:43:52.318]  This is just wave one, man.
[02:43:52.599 --> 02:43:53.779]  They've got more things coming.
[02:43:53.819 --> 02:43:57.021]  This is just to make America weak so they can launch the major attack.
[02:43:57.381 --> 02:43:57.701]  I don't know.
[02:44:14.778 --> 02:44:15.018]  Yes.
[02:44:15.358 --> 02:44:22.844]  So if we're going to sit at home for a month in America and wonder about our kids' future, we'd like to see people that have their fingerprints on this held accountable.
[02:44:22.884 --> 02:44:30.489]  Round them up, investigate them before you, you know, give them their rights, but investigate, see if they have their fingerprints on this.
[02:44:30.959 --> 02:44:31.079]  Yes.
[02:44:31.099 --> 02:44:31.159]  Yes.
[02:44:47.051 --> 02:44:50.232]  Trump needs to quit playing politics and speak clear and simple.
[02:44:50.292 --> 02:44:52.413]  I'm a huge Trump supporter, but I'm a huge critic.
[02:44:52.773 --> 02:44:54.913]  I don't like being talked to like I'm stupid.
[02:44:55.294 --> 02:44:57.374]  He needs to come out and quit playing politics.
[02:44:57.574 --> 02:45:00.015]  It's way too serious to play politics.
[02:45:00.395 --> 02:45:02.456]  If people can't grow up, then too bad.
[02:45:02.816 --> 02:45:09.558]  It's something that we face and we have to step up to our kids and this country and the world has a future.
[02:45:10.725 --> 02:45:11.986]  Well, I think you just nailed it, Jordan.
[02:45:12.006 --> 02:45:16.949]  Trump needs to get ahead of this, and he needs to now announce what are the origins, who's behind this.
[02:45:16.989 --> 02:45:18.190]  It's another deep state attack.
[02:45:18.750 --> 02:45:27.717]  It's an engineered weapon against America, and he needs to make the arrests of those who are responsible, or at least start the investigations and then maybe have indictments when the evidence supports it.
[02:45:28.117 --> 02:45:28.857]  I agree with you, Jordan.
[02:45:28.877 --> 02:45:29.258]  Great call.
[02:45:29.558 --> 02:45:31.419]  Let's go to Heath in Louisiana.
[02:45:31.779 --> 02:45:34.161]  Heath, you've been listening to these calls.
[02:45:34.701 --> 02:45:39.024]  Maybe you have comments on those previous callers, or you have your own comments, but you're live now, Heath.
[02:45:39.484 --> 02:45:40.025]  Let's hear from you.
[02:45:41.257 --> 02:45:44.318]  Yeah, I've been listening to everybody and on their intakes on everything.
[02:45:44.338 --> 02:45:50.641]  You know, when it comes to the coronavirus, you know, since the beginning of time, you know, our bodies are meant to be vessels for God.
[02:45:51.501 --> 02:45:54.103]  And we're made in his image and the devil knows that.
[02:45:54.403 --> 02:46:00.525]  So from generation to generation, the truth has been passed down, but also amongst that lies have been passed down.
[02:46:01.146 --> 02:46:04.127]  And one of the devices that the devil likes to use is repetition.
[02:46:04.727 --> 02:46:09.029]  And throughout times, he has been using repetition through music, movies and media.
[02:46:09.491 --> 02:46:17.717]  And in the media, they keep constantly talking about the same thing over and over, using circular reasoning to explain nothing, to waste our time, our value, and our money.
[02:46:18.517 --> 02:46:28.124]  And with all the things that they are being pushing, using all this propaganda and stuff like that, they have the weight and the ability to manipulate people's minds on how they can approach the coronavirus.
[02:46:28.204 --> 02:46:30.485]  And how do you think they're using that power right now?
[02:46:30.545 --> 02:46:32.246]  What's their message right now?
[02:46:32.266 --> 02:46:37.690]  Well, right now, you know, like earlier when you were talking about how, you know, we need to lock down and
[02:46:38.140 --> 02:46:42.161]  Keep safe and be, you know, controlled, you know, the whole situation and all that.
[02:46:42.601 --> 02:46:53.463]  They already know that and they want it to break out to where everyone can get infected so they can control them even more and make them accept, you know, whatever agenda that they're trying to push.
[02:46:53.683 --> 02:46:54.903]  That's what I believe out of that.
[02:46:55.803 --> 02:46:58.964]  And besides that, um, I do have a question for you.
[02:46:59.264 --> 02:47:07.485]  Um, a few months ago, um, Alex and y'all, y'all were all talking about how, um, they were doing naval training, Russia, China, and Iran.
[02:47:08.112 --> 02:47:13.574]  In the season stuff to try to practice and all that kind of stuff whenever the General Soleimani got killed.
[02:47:14.034 --> 02:47:18.496]  And then literally a few weeks later, the virus started to accumulate more and more.
[02:47:18.516 --> 02:47:23.998]  And it just so happened that Russia was able to stop their borders at a certain time and stuff like that.
[02:47:24.078 --> 02:47:28.160]  And the way Iran's invading Greece and stuff like that is just really speculative to me.
[02:47:28.680 --> 02:47:36.163]  And I was going to ask you, if you think that they're able to use suicide bombers, wouldn't they be able to just send anybody in with the virus as well?
[02:47:37.020 --> 02:47:38.261]  Well, yeah, absolutely.
[02:47:38.301 --> 02:47:44.706]  In fact, I described that here on InfoWars weeks ago, and I believe that's happened.
[02:47:44.806 --> 02:47:50.130]  I believe that the reason this is spreading so aggressively across American cities is not just by chance.
[02:47:50.290 --> 02:47:51.171]  I think it's deliberate.
[02:47:51.251 --> 02:48:00.538]  I think that probably China, maybe Iran harvested it, had, quote, suicide bombers, you know, biological suicide people infected deliberately.
[02:48:01.218 --> 02:48:04.559]  And before they started to show symptoms, they were able to get past airport security.
[02:48:04.900 --> 02:48:06.100]  They flew them into U.S.
[02:48:06.140 --> 02:48:08.761]  cities to spread this all across the United States.
[02:48:09.061 --> 02:48:10.062]  I think that's already happened.
[02:48:11.002 --> 02:48:13.003]  So, you're right on the money.
[02:48:13.503 --> 02:48:14.483]  This is happening.
[02:48:14.743 --> 02:48:16.284]  Look, let's go to some more callers.
[02:48:16.304 --> 02:48:17.445]  We've got a lot of great callers today.
[02:48:17.505 --> 02:48:18.565]  Chris in Florida.
[02:48:19.105 --> 02:48:20.306]  You're on the air with Mike Adams.
[02:48:20.386 --> 02:48:21.446]  Chris, go ahead.
[02:48:21.466 --> 02:48:22.226]  Nice to have you on the show.
[02:48:22.607 --> 02:48:23.367]  Oh, Chris dropped off.
[02:48:23.547 --> 02:48:24.767]  Let's go to Greg in Montana.
[02:48:25.808 --> 02:48:27.108]  Greg, if you're on the phone, you're live.
[02:48:29.215 --> 02:48:31.396]  Hi Mike, thank you very much for taking my call.
[02:48:31.796 --> 02:48:34.156]  I've got several points if I can rush through them.
[02:48:34.176 --> 02:48:42.959]  The first is March 11, 2004, Madrid train station bombing, 200 killed, 2,000 wounded.
[02:48:43.019 --> 02:48:43.359]  Wow.
[02:48:43.379 --> 02:48:47.540]  I think that they've self-revealed by using this date again.
[02:48:47.560 --> 02:48:49.081]  Yep, yep, the date.
[02:48:49.101 --> 02:48:50.721]  Again, the globalists believe in the dates.
[02:48:50.781 --> 02:48:52.281]  They like the numbers to line up.
[02:48:52.321 --> 02:48:52.942]  They keep doing it.
[02:48:52.962 --> 02:48:55.382]  And what are your other points?
[02:48:55.482 --> 02:48:57.903]  I think the main thing I'd like to say is
[02:48:58.516 --> 02:49:08.904]  Trump will be re-elected if he uses this as a come-to-God moment for the nation and tries to lead the country back to God.
[02:49:11.126 --> 02:49:14.668]  Well, I agree with you.
[02:49:15.229 --> 02:49:17.851]  He's in a position to do it.
[02:49:18.791 --> 02:49:20.673]  If we pray for him, I think he will.
[02:49:22.315 --> 02:49:31.447]  All right, let's pray for Trump to really get on top of this, take a leadership role, and let's no longer hear Mike Pence telling us this is just the flu or something like that.
[02:49:31.487 --> 02:49:32.168]  I mean, give me a break.
[02:49:32.208 --> 02:49:32.448]  Come on.
[02:49:32.969 --> 02:49:34.150]  This is way worse than the flu.
[02:49:34.190 --> 02:49:36.173]  Good points, Greg, from Montana.
[02:49:36.574 --> 02:49:38.977]  I'll have to apologize to the other callers, Monica and Debbie.
[02:49:39.537 --> 02:49:40.218]  We are out of time.
[02:49:40.819 --> 02:49:41.499]  For today's show.
[02:49:42.019 --> 02:49:51.023]  But hey, as long as bandwidth still works, I will be joining you from my quarantine station in Central Texas in the weeks and days ahead.
[02:49:51.563 --> 02:49:53.504]  I hope you've learned something from today's show.
[02:49:53.524 --> 02:49:56.445]  We've had a lot of good callers, a lot of intelligent analysis.
[02:49:56.885 --> 02:49:58.125]  Bottom line, get ready.
[02:49:58.606 --> 02:50:00.366]  It's way worse than anything I predicted.
[02:50:01.027 --> 02:50:06.068]  And probably some lockdowns are coming to certain states and regions for sure.
[02:50:06.389 --> 02:50:09.690]  Maybe the entire country at some point in the weeks ahead.
[02:50:10.270 --> 02:50:12.833]  This is Mike Adams, a health ranger for naturalnews.com.
[02:50:13.374 --> 02:50:14.375]  Thank you for watching today.
[02:50:14.876 --> 02:50:17.439]  The War Room begins now with Owen Schroer.
[02:50:21.989 --> 02:50:25.272]  Unwind with Emmerich's Essentials Natural Herbal Body Wash.
[02:50:25.572 --> 02:50:29.635]  Pure, unscented, and organically formulated for the most sensitive skin.
[02:50:30.035 --> 02:50:34.418]  Gently cleanse this, leaving you silky smooth, soft, and glowing.
[02:50:35.159 --> 02:50:37.881]  Experience the difference with Emmerich's Essentials.

[02:50:54.611 --> 02:51:03.534]  Unlike other skincare products that claim to be organic but are not, this product is certified organic, free from harsh chemicals that can irritate the skin.
[02:51:04.274 --> 02:51:09.116]  Enhance your bathing experience today with Emerge Essentials Natural Herbal Body Wash.
[02:51:09.556 --> 02:51:12.117]  Let Mother Nature caress your blemishes away.
[02:51:12.898 --> 02:51:15.839]  Reward yourself with a soothing, pleasant experience.
[02:51:16.700 --> 02:51:18.907]  Available at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:51:21.149 --> 02:51:30.474]  Six weeks ago, we warned you that the choreographed nature of the global media and governments concerning coronavirus told us it was a major globalist operation.
[02:51:31.095 --> 02:51:41.780]  Now, whether it's super deadly or not, the issue is it's being used by the globalists as a weapon against the world economy and against nation states and against the populist movement here in America.
[02:51:42.281 --> 02:51:43.281]  And against Infowars.
[02:51:43.561 --> 02:51:44.562]  And that means against you.
[02:51:45.062 --> 02:51:50.045]  So however you're going to do it, now is the time to get ready and to get prepared with emergency supplies
[02:51:50.606 --> 02:51:53.148]  And items that are known to boost your immune system.
[02:51:54.128 --> 02:51:56.010]  They're all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:51:56.170 --> 02:51:58.471]  High quality storable food when nobody else has got it.
[02:51:59.112 --> 02:52:08.698]  Super powerful formulas like DNA Force Plus, X2, X3, Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, and our Nano Silver line of products.
[02:52:08.798 --> 02:52:13.542]  A bunch of which has been sold out, but a bunch of which is coming back in later this week.
[02:52:13.802 --> 02:52:16.944]  So check it all out at InfoWarsTore.com and get prepared.
[02:52:25.823 --> 02:52:36.077]  Ladies and gentlemen, InfoWars sponsor and InfoWarsStore.com has high quality storable food at the lowest price you're gonna find and they've not raised prices yet.
[02:52:36.718 --> 02:52:40.162]  But they're up to five, six, seven, eight weeks for delivery depending on the item.
[02:52:40.303 --> 02:52:42.045]  They're under promising over delivering.
[02:52:42.205 --> 02:52:44.105]  But everybody else has been sold out for a month.
[02:52:44.125 --> 02:52:45.866]  We told you about the FEMA emergency first.
[02:52:45.946 --> 02:52:47.266]  We told you about the cover-up first.
[02:52:47.346 --> 02:52:53.767]  Whether this virus is super deadly or not, they're using the crisis that has come with it to take over and have power and control.
[02:52:53.887 --> 02:52:55.627]  Trump is not trying to do that.
[02:52:55.647 --> 02:53:01.828]  But there's no doubt that everyone I talk to, including myself, I'm not trying to cough here on air to illustrate this.
[02:53:01.868 --> 02:53:02.429]  I can't stop.
[02:53:02.449 --> 02:53:04.749]  I talked to Tyler Nixon during the break, Roger Stone's lawyer.
[02:53:05.069 --> 02:53:05.989]  He hasn't been sick in years.
[02:53:06.189 --> 02:53:07.889]  He has pneumonia.
[02:53:07.949 --> 02:53:09.110]  He's super sick right now.
[02:53:09.130 --> 02:53:10.090]  Flew back from D.C.
[02:53:11.370 --> 02:53:14.011]  Everybody I know that's flown is super sick.
[02:53:14.091 --> 02:53:15.331]  That's what Steve McShannick said a month ago.
[02:53:15.351 --> 02:53:16.671]  He said it's already all over the U.S.
[02:53:16.711 --> 02:53:17.491]  That's confirmed now.
[02:53:17.651 --> 02:53:18.612]  It's race-specific, though.
[02:53:18.632 --> 02:53:19.552]  It mainly kills Asians.
[02:53:19.592 --> 02:53:20.652]  Well, that's still a problem.
[02:53:20.672 --> 02:53:21.272]  It's still sad.
[02:53:21.312 --> 02:53:21.992]  We care about them.
[02:53:22.092 --> 02:53:24.173]  But it's the globalist launching this.
[02:53:24.333 --> 02:53:25.673]  It's man-made right now.
[02:53:25.893 --> 02:53:27.273]  That's why you've got to be concerned.
[02:53:27.373 --> 02:53:30.534]  So check that checklist off to get high-quality, storable food.
[02:53:30.574 --> 02:53:35.735]  The only place you're going to get it at five times less than store-to-cost, because they mark it up, is InfoWareStore.com.
[02:53:35.875 --> 02:53:39.616]  And if I lied to you and said, oh, it's seven days delivery, we'd have five times the orders.
[02:53:39.676 --> 02:53:40.196]  But I won't.
[02:53:40.356 --> 02:53:40.577]  Do it!
[02:53:40.697 --> 02:53:42.461]  The truth is, it's about four-week delivery, they told me.
[02:53:42.481 --> 02:53:48.876]  They said, don't say that on air because people get mad, but most of our stuff's four weeks, but some of it's six, seven weeks with specialty items, so don't.
[02:53:48.916 --> 02:53:49.297]  Tell them that.
[02:53:49.317 --> 02:53:49.778]  You know what?
[02:53:49.878 --> 02:53:50.380]  I'm gonna tell you.
[02:53:51.474 --> 02:53:54.417]  On the corporate contract, six to eight weeks, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:53:54.437 --> 02:53:57.140]  We've got all the other great items, DNA Force Plus, X2.
[02:53:57.200 --> 02:54:01.144]  Boosting your immune system is just as important as having storable foods.
[02:54:01.224 --> 02:54:04.107]  For economic collapse, for war, for whatever, it lasts 25 years.
[02:54:04.167 --> 02:54:07.130]  With inflation, you buy it, it locks in the cost, save money that way.
[02:54:07.170 --> 02:54:09.112]  It's a great investment and it funds the InfoWar.
[02:54:09.392 --> 02:54:11.534]  Take action, InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:54:20.922 --> 02:54:21.683]  Real stuff, man.
[02:54:21.703 --> 02:54:22.843]  We're talking about the real deal here.
[02:54:22.863 --> 02:54:28.287]  And I love Trump all day long, but man, I tell you, he sits there and lets these big tech people keep running roughshod over him.
[02:54:29.693 --> 02:54:30.533]  I mean, I've got a problem.
[02:54:31.193 --> 02:54:32.714]  And we'll just take the Trump rallies over.
[02:54:32.914 --> 02:54:36.175]  That said, about two months ago, I came up with a plan that I haven't launched yet.
[02:54:36.695 --> 02:54:39.956]  We have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers.
[02:54:40.556 --> 02:54:41.276]  20 different stickers.
[02:54:41.796 --> 02:54:43.016]  Impeach the Democrats.
[02:54:43.416 --> 02:54:44.457]  Save the Second Amendment.
[02:54:44.477 --> 02:54:45.517]  Defend the First Amendment.
[02:54:45.577 --> 02:54:46.537]  Infowars.com.
[02:54:46.897 --> 02:54:48.258]  And it looks like duct tape.
[02:54:48.318 --> 02:54:49.058]  It's just a regular sticker.
[02:54:49.078 --> 02:54:49.918]  You put it over your mouth.
[02:54:50.098 --> 02:54:51.238]  You go to a Trump rally.
[02:54:51.398 --> 02:54:53.799]  And you instantly take over without even disrupting things.
[02:54:53.819 --> 02:54:55.059]  People say, why are you doing this?
[02:54:55.439 --> 02:54:55.939]  What's happening?
[02:54:55.959 --> 02:54:57.440]  Well, you go, well, we're being censored.
[02:54:58.120 --> 02:54:59.481]  You know, Trump won't do anything about it.
[02:54:59.581 --> 02:55:02.864]  And Dr. Puccini, let me just ask you what you think, because I've not watched this yet.
[02:55:02.904 --> 02:55:03.465]  It's brilliant.
[02:55:03.885 --> 02:55:10.711]  You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with, that's silence, and made it into a weapon.
[02:55:10.971 --> 02:55:13.733]  You have the loudest sound of all, silence.
[02:55:13.933 --> 02:55:16.135]  And you know what's most disturbing to people?
[02:55:16.756 --> 02:55:17.256]  Silence.
