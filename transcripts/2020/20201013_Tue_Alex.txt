[00:00:18.203 --> 00:00:19.603]  This is the rules there.
[00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:27.146]  If this is where we are, is it basically mean that the vaccine is our only hope of getting back to normal?
[00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:37.428]  Yeah, well, society should be able to have things like schooling that get a priority versus certain more entertainment related things.
[00:00:37.428 --> 00:00:42.750]  And I guess, you know, politicians will will show what their value system is there.
[00:00:43.470 --> 00:01:04.718]  The only way we'll get completely back to normal is by having not maybe not the first generation vaccines but eventually a vaccine that is super effective and that a lot of the people take and that we get the disease eliminated on a global basis.
[00:01:04.718 --> 00:01:06.859]  That is where we can finally
[00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:16.118]  Uh, start taking all the problems that have been created in education, mental health and start to build back in a positive way.
[00:01:16.118 --> 00:01:20.419]  You have said your foundation said that this pandemic may have set back.
[00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:28.722]  Um, you know, we had made advances in decreasing poverty around the world and decreasing those that went without food.
[00:01:28.722 --> 00:01:31.943]  And I think you had said this pandemic basically erased 20 years of progress.
[00:01:32.643 --> 00:01:36.845]  How long before we can start making progress again?
[00:01:36.845 --> 00:01:44.749]  This virus, are we looking at 2022, 2023 when we feel like we'll have this virus under control around the world?
[00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:50.152]  A few things like getting their health systems and vaccination rates back up.
[00:01:50.152 --> 00:01:54.474]  You can probably get that back in shape within three or four years.
[00:01:54.474 --> 00:01:58.756]  The poverty impacts and educational impacts will be more
[00:01:59.386 --> 00:02:05.549]  Like 10 plus years, because they didn't have the ability to write lots of checks.
[00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.850]  You know, their jobs are not in offices at all.
[00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:18.994]  Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you understand that this confirms everything that the Rockefeller and Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation said they would do in the last few decades.
[00:02:18.994 --> 00:02:23.416]  A planetary lockdown using the threat of a contagion
[00:02:24.704 --> 00:02:32.169]  To radically change the way we live is a global reset to cut the carbon footprint and destroy civilization.
[00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:36.572]  First, they tell you 15 days to flatten the curve, leave hospitals open.
[00:02:36.572 --> 00:02:38.974]  Then it's a month, then it's two months, then it's eight months.
[00:02:38.974 --> 00:02:39.875]  Now we're eight months in.
[00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:41.536]  Then it's, oh, the end of 2021.
[00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:42.236]  Oh, it's four years.
[00:02:42.236 --> 00:02:43.357]  Oh, it's 10 years.
[00:02:46.291 --> 00:02:48.211]  We'll never come out of this.
[00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:51.372]  Notice they say the first vaccines won't be effective, but don't worry.
[00:02:51.372 --> 00:02:58.053]  You'll get up to five COVID vaccines a year that are experimental, and everyone's gonna want you to do it so we can, quote, get back to normal.
[00:02:58.053 --> 00:03:01.234]  Not that we're being held hostage.
[00:03:01.234 --> 00:03:06.995]  COVID hasn't even killed a million people worldwide, and that's when you look at them adding folks that died of other things to it.
[00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:08.715]  It's probably more like 100,000 worldwide.
[00:03:08.715 --> 00:03:14.056]  It is a very weak, real virus, but it spreads very easily, so you can be a suspect, so you can be bad.
[00:03:14.898 --> 00:03:16.179]  And, of course, all the false positives.
[00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:35.311]  He goes on to say, in this eight-minute interview we're going to analyze today, here in the first hour, this profoundly earth-shaking interview with the master of the planet, Bill Gates, our planetary ruler, that the lockdown never ends and that it won't end until not one person
[00:03:36.616 --> 00:03:38.257]  Has COVID-19.
[00:03:38.257 --> 00:03:39.337]  Total eradication.
[00:03:39.337 --> 00:03:40.958]  Of course, you learn that they've gotten rid of polio.
[00:03:40.958 --> 00:03:41.678]  They haven't.
[00:03:41.678 --> 00:03:45.460]  They just don't call it polio, and the main cause is vaccines from his foundation.
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:53.724]  This is mass murder, megalomania, supervillain beyond any James Bond movie.
[00:03:53.724 --> 00:03:58.166]  You're witnessing right now, and you're in the crosshairs.
[00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:01.588]  And women, on average, have very susceptible to Stockholm Syndrome.
[00:04:01.588 --> 00:04:02.028]  So are men.
[00:04:03.314 --> 00:04:07.378]  And women are being praised as adopting all of this, and they will adopt it.
[00:04:07.378 --> 00:04:10.021]  They'll give it to their kids, their kids will die, they won't care.
[00:04:10.021 --> 00:04:12.423]  Because they can't admit they were conned, they can't admit they were wrong.
[00:04:13.288 --> 00:04:19.230]  It's going to be up to women that are awake and men that are awake to lead us out of this and to not comply with any of it.
[00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.811]  The maskies are the enemy.
[00:04:21.811 --> 00:04:33.296]  The maskies are brainwashed and once they wear the diaper over their face as a sign of sacrament and enslavement, they will then take the vaccine, they will then report their neighbors.
[00:04:33.296 --> 00:04:34.697]  This is hell on earth.
[00:04:34.697 --> 00:04:37.218]  The Texas governor is an enemy of America.
[00:04:37.218 --> 00:04:39.258]  Bill Gates is an enemy of humanity.
[00:04:39.258 --> 00:04:41.099]  All of these people are in on this.
[00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.540]  They know damn well what they're doing.
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.962]  This is the Planetary World Government UN Takeover.
[00:04:45.962 --> 00:04:46.722]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:46.722 --> 00:04:48.443]  This is an emergency transmission.
[00:04:48.443 --> 00:04:51.645]  If you want to live and have any future at all, you better share this link right now.
[00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:12.713]  For more than a hundred years, the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world government, abolish nation states, dumb down the population by taking control of education, and most importantly, taking control of Western medicine.
[00:05:12.713 --> 00:05:14.713]  Now, they had a bad name by the 1920s.
[00:05:14.713 --> 00:05:23.175]  They started converting over and funding other organizations and groups, like IBM, to continue on with their eugenics operations.
[00:05:23.895 --> 00:05:34.041]  Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates III, his father, of course, being the head of Planned Parenthood.
[00:05:34.041 --> 00:05:42.045]  And now he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the world, every national health system.
[00:05:42.045 --> 00:05:44.107]  Bill Gates is in control.
[00:05:44.107 --> 00:05:44.627]  They have spent
[00:05:45.007 --> 00:05:52.012]  A hundred plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in your body.
[00:05:52.012 --> 00:06:05.741]  This is the holy grail of their operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type of DNA in your body.
[00:06:05.741 --> 00:06:07.142]  It's Tuesday, October 13th.
[00:06:07.142 --> 00:06:08.102]  The year is 2020.
[00:06:08.102 --> 00:06:10.064]  We are 20 days out from the election.
[00:06:10.064 --> 00:06:10.624]  99 out.
[00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:14.059]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:14.960]  Very honored to be here.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:15.800]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.481]  Well, what we're about to air we already knew was the case.
[00:06:34.622 --> 00:06:36.144]  But now it's triple confirmed.
[00:06:36.144 --> 00:06:46.139]  If you go to InfoWars.com today, the most demonized, lied-about attack site on the planet by the forces of evil, you will see the headline up there.
[00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.081]  Nightmare confirmed!
[00:06:48.387 --> 00:06:53.210]  Planetary ruler Bill Gates announces lockdowns will never end.
[00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:58.994]  Gates and Rockefeller Foundation documents to tell plan for permanent worldwide lockdown.
[00:06:58.994 --> 00:07:07.940]  Last night, Bill Gates publicly confirmed the plan is being implemented as we speak and that civilization as we know it is over.
[00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:14.684]  I'm about to play much of the chilling eight minute interview.
[00:07:16.414 --> 00:07:21.397]  With Democrat Deep State operative who is interviewing Gates.
[00:07:21.397 --> 00:07:23.658]  The whole thing is scripted.
[00:07:23.658 --> 00:07:42.950]  Gates underwrites the very TV channel that he did this interview on and most of the newspapers because he's the consortium chairman of all the robber baron eugenics money of Ford, Carnegie, Rockefeller, IBM, and now of course his own wealth.
[00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:44.811]  That's why he's the planetary ruler.
[00:07:46.598 --> 00:07:50.679]  Big article by Paul Joseph Watson, where you can see the video and read the quotes yourself.
[00:07:50.679 --> 00:07:57.100]  Bill Gates says, world won't return to normal until a lot of people take a second COVID vaccine.
[00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.561]  The headline's strong, but not strong enough.
[00:07:59.561 --> 00:08:05.102]  What he actually says is, the world economy will be permanently devastated.
[00:08:05.102 --> 00:08:14.344]  And he goes on to say that it'll be a decade, maybe, until you're allowed to even have things like, quote, entertainment.
[00:08:14.344 --> 00:08:14.524]  So,
[00:08:15.612 --> 00:08:19.153]  This, this, this is beyond any James Bond villain movie.
[00:08:19.153 --> 00:08:21.253]  This is beyond anything in science fiction.
[00:08:21.253 --> 00:08:22.794]  This is actually real.
[00:08:22.794 --> 00:08:25.374]  This is actually happening right now.
[00:08:25.374 --> 00:08:28.035]  And, remember, it's all psychological.
[00:08:28.035 --> 00:08:30.116]  Oh, just put the handcuffs on.
[00:08:30.116 --> 00:08:33.156]  Oh, let us just tie you up and then we'll let you go in a few minutes.
[00:08:33.156 --> 00:08:35.237]  And you're locked up in a dungeon 20 years later.
[00:08:35.237 --> 00:08:36.357]  That's the same thing.
[00:08:36.357 --> 00:08:36.917]  Oh, just 15 days.
[00:08:36.917 --> 00:08:42.159]  There's going to be a couple million dead in the next month and we've got to have enough space at the hospital.
[00:08:42.159 --> 00:08:42.879]  Just stay inside.
[00:08:44.121 --> 00:08:48.965]  And then now just wear this mask and, oh, your job is not essential, yours is.
[00:08:48.965 --> 00:08:53.249]  Oh, just take, you know, take this app on your phone to go to university, do this and that.
[00:08:53.249 --> 00:08:56.532]  This is the total rollout in their own words.
[00:08:56.532 --> 00:09:01.277]  And I told you eight months ago, it won't be a 15-day, it'll be forever.
[00:09:01.277 --> 00:09:09.905]  And I said, by the fall or by the winter, I'm on record saying this, they will tell you that it is a permanent lockdown.
[00:09:11.226 --> 00:09:14.288]  And now, right on time, they're telling you, permanent lockdown.
[00:09:14.288 --> 00:09:24.837]  After about eight months, most people, particularly women, particularly, I think it's women, it's just known in the psychological warfare manuals, will become habituated to slavery and will shift into Stockholm Syndrome, loving their abuser.
[00:09:25.876 --> 00:09:32.279]  And now people like their mask, like a lot of kids that didn't get enough attention, had a blanket that they loved.
[00:09:32.279 --> 00:09:35.560]  I mean, of course, my daughter gets a lot of attention, but she has a blanket she likes.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:36.341]  She's three.
[00:09:36.341 --> 00:09:37.321]  Binky.
[00:09:37.321 --> 00:09:39.302]  But it's binky!
[00:09:39.302 --> 00:09:52.748]  And so they're being taught a neurotic neuroses, and once they've learned to be a maskie, like in Islam, wearing the burqa, the bee suit, then out of that cult initiation, that's what this all is,
[00:09:54.315 --> 00:09:57.576]  They will then accept the contact tracing, the forced inoculations.
[00:09:57.576 --> 00:10:00.537]  And Gates says it'll be five COVID shots a year.
[00:10:00.537 --> 00:10:02.837]  We have video of that coming up.
[00:10:02.837 --> 00:10:04.998]  But here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:04.998 --> 00:10:09.539]  He says, until it is totally eradicated worldwide.
[00:10:09.539 --> 00:10:13.600]  Well, false positives on any cold virus.
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.301]  And so they're saying, until we eradicate the cold, which is impossible, you can never go back to normal.
[00:10:19.301 --> 00:10:21.062]  But that's the cover for Marshall Law.
[00:10:22.537 --> 00:10:33.522]  And the technocracy and what Microsoft has really been up to this whole time, a subsidiary of IBM, which his mother basically ran.
[00:10:33.522 --> 00:10:40.646]  And again, all of this was done to get around trust busting back when IBM was about to be broken up.
[00:10:40.646 --> 00:10:44.447]  So Bill Gates has always been a little lying snake.
[00:10:44.447 --> 00:10:45.688]  He's always been a eugenicist.
[00:10:45.688 --> 00:10:48.249]  He's always openly said he wants to depopulate you and your family.
[00:10:48.249 --> 00:10:49.590]  He's always said he wants to kill old people.
[00:10:50.421 --> 00:10:53.762]  But boy, does he want to put something in your body to take care of you.
[00:10:53.762 --> 00:10:58.023]  And now he tells you in this interview, oh, the world economy's never coming back.
[00:10:58.023 --> 00:11:06.065]  And he and the reporter are in this synced up script that he goes through on every channel, whether it's Japanese TV or U.S.
[00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:08.126]  television, the same story.
[00:11:08.126 --> 00:11:12.967]  So first it's 15 days, and then it's six months, and then it's two years.
[00:11:12.967 --> 00:11:16.848]  And the reporter says, oh, you mean four years now?
[00:11:16.848 --> 00:11:18.469]  And Gage goes, no, it's 10 years.
[00:11:20.196 --> 00:11:22.678]  It's 10 years!
[00:11:22.678 --> 00:11:25.480]  And now the maskies are going to report you for not having a vaccine.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.744]  The maskies are going to report who runs their restaurant, doesn't make you wear a mask.
[00:11:29.744 --> 00:11:33.867]  The maskies are going to report who you're letting in without your contact tracing app on your phone.
[00:11:33.867 --> 00:11:36.809]  It's already happening in England, Canada, and at universities in the U.S.
[00:11:36.809 --> 00:11:37.970]  It's all rolled out.
[00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.632]  It's a scientific criminal plan.
[00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:48.579]  And we must demand Congress and the President stand up and reject this AI, world government, U.N., CHICOM, big tech takeover.
[00:11:50.097 --> 00:11:52.899]  Big Tech has nothing but disdain for Congress.
[00:11:52.899 --> 00:11:56.582]  Big Tech has nothing but disdain for you.
[00:11:56.582 --> 00:11:57.783]  It's bigger than government.
[00:11:57.783 --> 00:11:59.085]  It's more powerful than government.
[00:11:59.085 --> 00:12:01.166]  It surveils more than government.
[00:12:01.166 --> 00:12:05.430]  And it's partnered with authoritarian governments worldwide.
[00:12:05.430 --> 00:12:12.456]  Now a former top Australian minister has gone public saying it's about a great reset to shut down the world economy and consolidate it.
[00:12:14.312 --> 00:12:18.653]  Trump has come out and said he was right about damaging lockdowns, which the UN said need to end.
[00:12:18.653 --> 00:12:19.593]  And it's killing millions.
[00:12:19.593 --> 00:12:22.914]  Johnson & Johnson had to pause their weak coronavirus vaccines.
[00:12:22.914 --> 00:12:26.395]  It's making people sick and almost killing them.
[00:12:26.395 --> 00:12:31.216]  Former Australian Senator says the Great Reset is the real agenda behind COVID panic.
[00:12:31.216 --> 00:12:33.937]  But there I was Saturday, nicely
[00:12:35.182 --> 00:12:40.986]  Publicly addressing leftists on South Congress in Austin, saying, millions have starved in Africa.
[00:12:40.986 --> 00:12:42.107]  Here's the UN report.
[00:12:42.107 --> 00:12:43.668]  It's called the Great Reset.
[00:12:43.668 --> 00:12:46.289]  Please understand, F-U racist!
[00:12:46.289 --> 00:12:48.691]  White people screaming, F-U racist.
[00:12:50.563 --> 00:12:52.264]  And say, where are your kids?
[00:12:52.264 --> 00:12:53.185]  You don't have your kids.
[00:12:53.185 --> 00:12:53.946]  That's not true.
[00:12:53.946 --> 00:12:55.347]  How's your DWI?
[00:12:55.347 --> 00:12:55.908]  It was dropped.
[00:12:55.908 --> 00:12:57.109]  I don't have a DWI.
[00:12:57.109 --> 00:12:58.970]  I told you, I didn't blow it to level.
[00:12:58.970 --> 00:13:00.852]  But they would just shout these things at me.
[00:13:00.852 --> 00:13:03.774]  And I'm like, listen, it's starving the third world.
[00:13:03.774 --> 00:13:05.035]  It's collapsing us here.
[00:13:05.035 --> 00:13:05.776]  It's irrevocable.
[00:13:05.776 --> 00:13:07.397]  Decades of wealth is being destroyed.
[00:13:07.397 --> 00:13:09.799]  You'll never get your college funds paid off now.
[00:13:09.799 --> 00:13:12.942]  But they don't care because they feel like they're with the winning team.
[00:13:14.275 --> 00:13:15.716]  I'm not going to interrupt him.
[00:13:15.716 --> 00:13:16.957]  I'm going to come back and talk about him.
[00:13:16.957 --> 00:13:28.147]  Let's play two and a half minutes as we go to break of Bill Gates on national TV telling you it's never ending and that he's your God and that he controls your body and that he's planetary ruler.
[00:13:29.039 --> 00:13:31.441]  And then get pissed and call Congress and tell them to say no.
[00:13:31.441 --> 00:13:32.582]  I know Trump's listening.
[00:13:32.582 --> 00:13:34.563]  We broke that the UN came out.
[00:13:34.563 --> 00:13:37.225]  Nobody else was covering it and said the lockdowns are killing everybody.
[00:13:37.225 --> 00:13:38.346]  Now it's top news.
[00:13:38.346 --> 00:13:39.487]  That's why we're here.
[00:13:39.487 --> 00:13:40.368]  That's why you're here.
[00:13:40.368 --> 00:13:41.148]  And we're winning.
[00:13:41.148 --> 00:13:43.770]  We're not just fighting back because it's the right thing to do.
[00:13:43.770 --> 00:13:46.433]  We're fighting back because it's the right thing to do and we're winning!
[00:13:46.433 --> 00:13:47.593]  Thanks to you!
[00:13:47.593 --> 00:13:49.335]  Now here's your number one enemy.
[00:13:49.335 --> 00:13:52.477]  Planetary head of the world eugenics system.
[00:13:52.477 --> 00:13:54.439]  The anti-Christ right-hand man.
[00:13:54.439 --> 00:13:56.480]  Bill Bernan-Hell-Gates.
[00:13:57.455 --> 00:13:58.835]  This is the rules there.
[00:13:58.835 --> 00:14:06.378]  If this is where we are, is it basically mean that the vaccine is our only hope of getting back to normal?
[00:14:06.378 --> 00:14:16.660]  Yeah, well, society should be able to have things like schooling that get a priority versus certain more entertainment related things.
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:21.982]  And I guess, you know, politicians will will show what their value system is there.
[00:14:22.699 --> 00:14:43.953]  The only way we'll get completely back to normal is by having not maybe not the first generation vaccines, but eventually a vaccine that is super effective and that a lot of the people take and that we get the disease eliminated on a global basis.
[00:14:43.953 --> 00:14:46.094]  That is where we can finally
[00:14:46.901 --> 00:14:55.363]  Uh, start taking all the problems that have been created in education, mental health and start to build back in a positive way.
[00:14:55.363 --> 00:14:59.664]  You have said your foundation said that this pandemic may have set back.
[00:14:59.664 --> 00:15:07.965]  Um, you know, we had made advances in decreasing poverty around the world and decreasing those that went without food.
[00:15:07.965 --> 00:15:11.166]  And I think you had said this pandemic basically erased 20 years of progress.
[00:15:11.886 --> 00:15:16.088]  How long before we can start making progress again?
[00:15:16.088 --> 00:15:23.991]  This virus, are we looking at 2022, 2023 when we feel like we'll have this virus under control around the world?
[00:15:23.991 --> 00:15:29.393]  A few things like getting their health systems and vaccination rates back up.
[00:15:29.393 --> 00:15:32.914]  You can probably get that back in shape within three or four years.
[00:15:33.689 --> 00:15:44.991]  The poverty impacts and educational impacts will be more like 10 plus years because they didn't have the ability to write lots of checks.
[00:15:44.991 --> 00:15:48.872]  You know, their jobs are not in offices at all.
[00:15:48.872 --> 00:15:52.373]  So they've suffered disproportionately.
[00:15:52.373 --> 00:15:57.394]  And this gradual progress that's usually very positive.
[00:15:57.954 --> 00:16:01.156]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[00:16:01.156 --> 00:16:09.702]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence, is going to be your most valuable asset.
[00:16:09.702 --> 00:16:13.284]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[00:16:13.284 --> 00:16:25.993]  The world being built by the technocrats, and the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown, is the beginning of the process of taking a past domestication into total
[00:16:27.173 --> 00:16:29.735]  Incomplete dehumanization.
[00:16:29.735 --> 00:16:35.879]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[00:16:35.879 --> 00:16:39.701]  This is their stated goal.
[00:16:39.701 --> 00:16:49.267]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy can we turn this around.
[00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:55.371]  You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips with it.
[00:16:55.371 --> 00:16:57.793]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[00:16:57.793 --> 00:17:12.363]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:17:12.363 --> 00:17:14.264]  Infowars has been banned.
[00:17:14.264 --> 00:17:17.166]  Arrested.
[00:17:20.661 --> 00:17:23.404]  Attacked and threatened.
[00:17:23.404 --> 00:17:26.727]  Because we are effective.
[00:17:26.727 --> 00:17:28.548]  The Great Awakening is here.
[00:17:28.548 --> 00:17:30.850]  Go to band.video.
[00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.974]  Download the videos and share.
[00:17:34.974 --> 00:17:42.301]  Support the Information War at infowarestore.com.
[00:17:42.301 --> 00:17:44.002]  And never give up the fight.
[00:17:53.607 --> 00:18:13.681]  InfoWars.com You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:18:13.681 --> 00:18:15.802]  This is it!
[00:18:15.802 --> 00:18:19.025]  You read the globalist documents of Harold Quickly, he's a victim of Zetsky.
[00:18:20.319 --> 00:18:25.401]  He read what Cecil Rhodes had to say 120 years ago about the plan for world government.
[00:18:25.401 --> 00:18:27.122]  He read what Sir Francis Dalton said.
[00:18:27.122 --> 00:18:30.664]  He read what George Orwell said.
[00:18:30.664 --> 00:18:32.845]  He studied the globalist plan.
[00:18:32.845 --> 00:18:37.186]  He read what Bill Gates had to say.
[00:18:37.186 --> 00:18:47.411]  And now we've seen them build the technocracy up to the point and domesticate the population up to the point and get us in a subservient mode up to the point.
[00:18:48.527 --> 00:19:00.857]  That people are literally ready to become prisoners in their own homes and be made obsolete by computers and robots that will be forced to take over all the farming, all the ranching, all the repairs, all the roofing.
[00:19:02.222 --> 00:19:11.633]  And a true dystopia, which the UN and the left are all bragging is great to lower the human population and lower the carbon footprint.
[00:19:11.633 --> 00:19:22.665]  And the main guy pushing it for 40 years, the known villain who had his monopoly broken up with the United Nations and a consortium of big tech.
[00:19:23.632 --> 00:19:32.757]  has launched a successful shutdown of the planet, dwarfing what Napoleon, Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Lenin could only dream of.
[00:19:32.757 --> 00:19:36.398]  I mean, we are living in modern warfare.
[00:19:36.398 --> 00:19:42.241]  In the chicken little operation where we hit our knees and give up all our rights.
[00:19:42.241 --> 00:19:44.963]  How did I tell you eight months ago that the lockdown would never end?
[00:19:46.032 --> 00:19:47.552]  Did I have a crystal ball out back?
[00:19:47.552 --> 00:19:48.373]  No.
[00:19:48.373 --> 00:19:50.273]  It was in Operation Lockstep.
[00:19:50.273 --> 00:19:51.353]  It was in Event 201.
[00:19:51.353 --> 00:19:54.734]  And I told you that COVID is a simulant.
[00:19:54.734 --> 00:19:59.736]  It's a live virus that spreads quickly so they can make everybody guilty of having it.
[00:19:59.736 --> 00:20:08.778]  And if you're very, very run down and have a lot of comorbidities, and if you have low vitamins and minerals that are essential, you will die.
[00:20:08.778 --> 00:20:12.919]  Any virus will do that.
[00:20:12.919 --> 00:20:15.140]  We let it all out to you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:16.069 --> 00:20:21.311]  We laid out every single bit of how they would do it.
[00:20:21.311 --> 00:20:28.093]  And now based off of that, Bill Gates is saying you can never leave your house again.
[00:20:28.093 --> 00:20:31.914]  How did we know it was coming?
[00:20:31.914 --> 00:20:35.756]  Because they're arrogant.
[00:20:35.756 --> 00:20:40.417]  Remember Bill Gates on Fareed Zakaria, three months into this, on CNN.
[00:20:40.417 --> 00:20:43.859]  The show that the Bilderberg Group basically produces.
[00:20:43.859 --> 00:20:44.979]  Fareed Zakaria is part of it.
[00:20:46.069 --> 00:20:48.510]  And he went on there, and Farid said, the lockdown never is really going to end.
[00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:50.231]  Civilization is over as we know it.
[00:20:50.231 --> 00:20:51.631]  And Gates really smiled and laughed.
[00:20:51.631 --> 00:20:53.712]  He said, yeah.
[00:20:53.712 --> 00:20:55.552]  He's like, oh, we're going to tell people.
[00:20:55.552 --> 00:21:07.077]  Just like five years ago, George Soros went on, Farid Zarkari, and said, I got $5 billion from Obama and Hillary, and we overthrew Ukraine.
[00:21:07.077 --> 00:21:12.839]  But then if you say that, the fact checkers get you banned on Facebook and say, no, he didn't do that, even though it's on video.
[00:21:13.544 --> 00:21:17.146]  Just like they say, George Soros never said he was a Nazi collaborator.
[00:21:17.146 --> 00:21:20.327]  He never said his favorite time of life was rounding up Jews.
[00:21:20.327 --> 00:21:23.428]  He just said it on 60 Minutes!
[00:21:23.428 --> 00:21:32.432]  But see, they're allowed to tell you how they're pissing on you, and when you say it's not rain, you can't... this is the mind control.
[00:21:32.432 --> 00:21:38.835]  And he said a lot of the statement in a video that's at InfoWars.com, and I suggest you go watch, because this is the guy that has more power over you
[00:21:40.196 --> 00:21:45.481]  Then your husband or your wife or your mommy or your daddy or your boss or your employees.
[00:21:45.481 --> 00:21:53.628]  This is a guy who is the front man of the group that spent all their money and their power to get control of your body.
[00:21:53.628 --> 00:21:57.711]  And he says, Oh, it's 10 years till you can do anything again.
[00:21:57.711 --> 00:21:59.012]  Oh, and it's a permanent lockdown.
[00:21:59.012 --> 00:22:02.535]  Oh, it's devastating the world economy and it's going to start millions.
[00:22:02.535 --> 00:22:03.656]  He's even admitting it.
[00:22:03.656 --> 00:22:04.697]  Get ready for the death.
[00:22:04.697 --> 00:22:07.940]  Get ready for the collapse because we have to stop anyone dying from COVID.
[00:22:09.366 --> 00:22:16.370]  So, it doesn't matter if 100 million starve to death, they estimate in the next couple of years, already millions have, but it's a domino effect, it gets worse.
[00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:22.433]  And then the third world floods us, and we gotta pay for taking care of them, which is all his plan.
[00:22:22.433 --> 00:22:28.316]  Now he goes, if we can just save one person, we have to shut down the whole economy and kill 100 million.
[00:22:28.316 --> 00:22:31.678]  And he went on to say, we cannot have one person ever have COVID again.
[00:22:31.678 --> 00:22:32.939]  An impossible goal.
[00:22:34.386 --> 00:22:37.491]  So that he continues to have total control forever.
[00:22:37.491 --> 00:22:45.303]  This is a scheme Lockstep admits ten years ago for the Rockefeller Foundation they would use it to bring in a planetary police state.
[00:22:45.303 --> 00:22:45.924]  These are quotes!
[00:22:47.878 --> 00:22:49.159]  You say, why do they brag?
[00:22:49.159 --> 00:22:57.323]  Because metaphysically, there's a galactic, universal rule that you have to tell people what you're doing to them.
[00:22:57.323 --> 00:22:59.224]  It's gotta be in the fine print.
[00:22:59.224 --> 00:23:00.724]  As above, so below.
[00:23:00.724 --> 00:23:02.945]  God has his rules, we just mimic them.
[00:23:02.945 --> 00:23:09.869]  So, it's not fraud in a contract, if it's super fine print in there, it says, by the way, I can screw you if I want.
[00:23:09.869 --> 00:23:13.190]  But it's still, you gotta get a magnifying glass, you gotta look.
[00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:16.292]  Well, this guy, you don't need a magnifying glass, it's in your face!
[00:23:17.941 --> 00:23:21.885]  So big, every print font is six inches tall!
[00:23:21.885 --> 00:23:22.766]  Screaming!
[00:23:22.766 --> 00:23:23.646]  I'm a eugenicist!
[00:23:23.646 --> 00:23:24.587]  My dad was one!
[00:23:24.587 --> 00:23:25.628]  My mom was one!
[00:23:25.628 --> 00:23:27.069]  The head of IBM was one!
[00:23:27.069 --> 00:23:28.231]  I want to kill you!
[00:23:28.231 --> 00:23:29.792]  I want planetary control!
[00:23:29.792 --> 00:23:30.733]  I'm a technocrat!
[00:23:30.733 --> 00:23:33.255]  I want to tell you how you can eat, where you sleep, and where you live!
[00:23:33.255 --> 00:23:34.977]  I want to put you in coffin apartments!
[00:23:34.977 --> 00:23:36.318]  And so does Jeff Bezos!
[00:23:36.318 --> 00:23:37.299]  And so does Bloomberg!
[00:23:37.299 --> 00:23:38.420]  They're all the same group!
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:39.481]  They're all the same cult!
[00:23:39.481 --> 00:23:40.422]  They're all the same people!
[00:23:42.096 --> 00:23:45.518]  And they mean b-b-b-b-business.
[00:23:45.518 --> 00:23:55.865]  And their business is making you poor, making you stupid, making you sick, making you desperate before they kill your miserable ass.
[00:23:55.865 --> 00:23:57.386]  So here he is in the same newscast.
[00:23:57.386 --> 00:23:59.467]  We didn't play it yet.
[00:23:59.467 --> 00:24:01.749]  Talking about, oh, forget all these new vaccines.
[00:24:02.978 --> 00:24:04.959]  I've got new ones coming out next year.
[00:24:04.959 --> 00:24:06.460]  He always wanted the lockdown to go longer.
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:07.601]  He's already got them patented.
[00:24:07.601 --> 00:24:08.641]  We showed them to you.
[00:24:08.641 --> 00:24:11.503]  He had them patented four years ago and two years ago.
[00:24:11.503 --> 00:24:18.247]  Super dangerous vaccines that make you super sick and change your DNA, go into your cells, all of it.
[00:24:18.247 --> 00:24:19.728]  I told you Trump was doing a dangerous game.
[00:24:19.728 --> 00:24:21.189]  I don't agree with it.
[00:24:21.189 --> 00:24:22.950]  People spin it and say, Jones is for inoculation.
[00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:23.930]  No, I'm not.
[00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:26.872]  I'm exposing what Trump's doing.
[00:24:26.872 --> 00:24:28.613]  Trump comes down and goes, oh, we got all these new vaccines.
[00:24:28.613 --> 00:24:32.015]  We'll have ours, not Gates's, because he knows Gates wants to keep the lockdown going.
[00:24:33.447 --> 00:24:41.516]  And make you take his vaccine that is not even a normal vaccine that teaches white blood cells how to kill something.
[00:24:41.516 --> 00:24:43.278]  So you guys, a shot of electron microscope is showing up.
[00:24:43.278 --> 00:24:45.600]  We'll show that next segment.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:48.363]  White blood cells eating viruses and bacteria.
[00:24:48.363 --> 00:24:51.166]  No, it goes into your cell and reprograms you.
[00:24:51.166 --> 00:24:54.390]  And actually changes who you are, every cell in your body.
[00:24:56.124 --> 00:24:59.367]  I mean, they're not just creeping up to making us Franken-creatures.
[00:24:59.367 --> 00:25:00.828]  They're jumping the whole thing.
[00:25:00.828 --> 00:25:04.611]  They're going a trillion miles, folks, hoping we push back a few billion.
[00:25:04.611 --> 00:25:06.592]  They still have got us a trillion.
[00:25:06.592 --> 00:25:07.913]  This is the big move.
[00:25:07.913 --> 00:25:09.374]  This is the big enchilada.
[00:25:09.374 --> 00:25:12.337]  And this dude is out in the open saying, he's your master.
[00:25:12.337 --> 00:25:18.061]  And notice, everybody does what he says, because he's got all the trillions behind him and all the big families.
[00:25:18.061 --> 00:25:19.322]  That's not Bill Gates.
[00:25:19.322 --> 00:25:22.565]  That's the figurehead of these people.
[00:25:22.565 --> 00:25:24.366]  That's the masthead.
[00:25:24.366 --> 00:25:25.127]  Here's what he had to say.
[00:25:26.977 --> 00:25:36.360]  There's a second wave of vaccines that will come sometime next year, and our foundation and a group we're part of called CEPI are funding those.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:37.020]  The U.S.
[00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:49.964]  government is not yet involved in that, but a few of those, like one that uses a measles vector, those are the most likely to be single-shot interventions, but most likely
[00:25:52.007 --> 00:25:56.772]  Almost all the vaccines will require the two shots.
[00:25:56.772 --> 00:25:59.674]  Sometimes I wonder, what's going to be the bigger challenge?
[00:25:59.674 --> 00:26:03.878]  The actual distribution of the vaccine or the public relations campaign?
[00:26:06.423 --> 00:26:11.385]  Yes, the skepticism about vaccines has always been an issue.
[00:26:11.385 --> 00:26:21.090]  And here where you have, you know, politicians kind of motivated to say, you know, they performed a miracle.
[00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:24.351]  Remember this guy says he wants to get rid of the population.
[00:26:24.351 --> 00:26:26.492]  Always remember, he wants you dead.
[00:26:26.492 --> 00:26:28.973]  Our current president was actually a vaccine skeptic.
[00:26:28.973 --> 00:26:31.595]  But now he wants to put something in you.
[00:26:31.595 --> 00:26:34.096]  Current situation is the most difficult.
[00:26:34.776 --> 00:26:37.577]  We're gonna come back and talk about this and play more of it.
[00:26:37.577 --> 00:26:41.239]  Yeah, he's a skeptic so he knew how to derail you and take control of it away from you.
[00:26:41.239 --> 00:26:46.242]  Doesn't mean I agree with what Trump's doing but I see it and it's actually working and that little monster's pissed.
[00:26:46.242 --> 00:26:52.165]  Bill Gates and everybody behind him are literal Nazis carrying out genocide against all of us.
[00:26:52.165 --> 00:26:53.185]  You understand that?
[00:26:53.185 --> 00:26:54.506]  They are killing everybody!
[00:26:57.043 --> 00:27:08.007]  In fiction, supervillains are known as supervillains because they have gigantic, huge, global plans that are incredibly well thought out and incredibly complex.
[00:27:08.007 --> 00:27:15.349]  And if I'd have told you a year ago, back in October of 2019, that a powerful billionaire who controls the UN would roll out a global
[00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:16.610]  You tell me that's crazy.
[00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:17.771]  You tell me that's a dystopia.
[00:27:17.771 --> 00:27:20.693]  You tell me that's some type of science fiction comic book.
[00:27:20.693 --> 00:27:22.795]  But in reality, it really did happen.
[00:27:40.029 --> 00:27:47.900]  His name is Bill Gates and he's the head of a major eugenics consortium that his father and mother set up more than 60 years ago.
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:51.105]  And we're living in this world Bill Gates has built.
[00:27:51.105 --> 00:27:53.868]  Until we start saying no, we are Bill Gates's property.
[00:27:53.868 --> 00:27:55.210]  It's time to expose Bill Gates.
[00:27:56.530 --> 00:28:13.863]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci, and I've been at the NIH and CDC for 45 years, and I've overseen, well, you know, the AIDS pandemic and so many other things, and I take my orders from Bill Gates, Dr. Bill Gates.
[00:28:13.863 --> 00:28:16.785]  I mean, he's not a doctor, but he controls
[00:28:17.185 --> 00:28:19.007]  Everything you do.
[00:28:19.007 --> 00:28:22.670]  And he now says, you're going to take the shots.
[00:28:22.670 --> 00:28:26.594]  And of course, in England, they are now saying what I told you.
[00:28:26.594 --> 00:28:28.376]  You will not be allowed to travel.
[00:28:28.376 --> 00:28:32.500]  Leave your home until you take all the shots.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.981]  Dr. Gates, I mean Bill.
[00:28:34.682 --> 00:28:41.608]  Gates, your owner, your master, says you ought to take four to five COVID shots a year.
[00:28:41.608 --> 00:28:47.774]  For adult, two for baby, and baby much more manageable.
[00:28:47.774 --> 00:28:51.197]  Just like Bill Gates give you polio vaccine.
[00:28:51.197 --> 00:28:54.220]  I'm Dr. Fauci, reminding you that we
[00:28:56.565 --> 00:28:59.486]  2020ElectionsCenter.com.
[00:28:59.486 --> 00:29:02.407]  Just type it in one time, and you've got it saved right there in your browser.
[00:29:02.407 --> 00:29:16.493]  Then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple platforms, and most importantly, via text message, email, or by word of mouth, because they have banned the links to ban.video.
[00:29:16.493 --> 00:29:25.017]  But 2020ElectionsCenter.com is a clone of the site, the exact same links, the exact same videos where you can comment, you can share them, everything.
[00:29:25.017 --> 00:29:25.537]  The system,
[00:29:26.497 --> 00:29:31.240]  Trump is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:37.565]  Trump has finally figured this out, and says he's going to take action once re-elected against big tech, and that he's moderating the situation.
[00:29:37.565 --> 00:29:42.028]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry because he has to take an action.
[00:29:42.028 --> 00:29:52.875]  We the people are taking action now, and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionsCenter.com, 2020ElectionsCenter.com, and checking out the new, redesigned InfoWars.com and sharing that link.
[00:29:52.875 --> 00:29:54.176]  Oh, that really upsets them.
[00:29:54.176 --> 00:29:54.717]  Oh, yeah.
[00:29:59.111 --> 00:30:02.792]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:02.792 --> 00:30:13.414]  I want to hear you scream and defiantly and serenely.
[00:30:13.414 --> 00:30:21.376]  I want to see you wake up and be ready to change.
[00:30:21.376 --> 00:30:23.136]  I want to see you win.
[00:30:27.179 --> 00:30:31.081]  Because together is the only chance we have of overriding these tyrants.
[00:30:31.081 --> 00:30:34.704]  By facing the true horror of what they're up to, we have more than a fighting chance.
[00:30:34.704 --> 00:30:37.525]  We have God's guarantee of victory.
[00:30:37.525 --> 00:30:48.812]  Those of us who are to lay down our blood, our sweat, our tears, our treasure, our very commitment at a cellular soul level.
[00:30:48.812 --> 00:30:49.953]  You have my commitment.
[00:30:51.630 --> 00:30:53.271]  People ask, how do I have so much energy?
[00:30:53.271 --> 00:30:56.074]  How do I get so focused on air?
[00:30:56.074 --> 00:30:59.177]  This is all real, my friends.
[00:30:59.177 --> 00:31:08.685]  When I read, when I was like 15 years old, one of Zbigniew Brzezinski's books where he bragged about putting Pol Pot in power so that Pol Pot could kill a third of the population.
[00:31:11.616 --> 00:31:14.637]  And then I went and researched the killing fields in Cambodia.
[00:31:14.637 --> 00:31:16.018]  I was like, who is this guy?
[00:31:16.018 --> 00:31:20.159]  And then I would see him for the rest of my life on TV being praised.
[00:31:20.159 --> 00:31:26.442]  I read his book where he bragged about, I didn't kill a third of Cambodia.
[00:31:26.442 --> 00:31:29.603]  I just put Pol Pot in and had him do it.
[00:31:29.603 --> 00:31:35.705]  And I'd watch him on C-SPAN at CFR meetings with sycophant old people going, Your Majesty.
[00:31:35.705 --> 00:31:39.107]  All because he killed so many people.
[00:31:39.107 --> 00:31:40.007]  These are killers.
[00:31:41.894 --> 00:31:45.436]  And you don't get up in the hierarchy of the New World Order unless you're killing people.
[00:31:45.436 --> 00:31:47.437]  Well, let me tell you who's running genocide worldwide.
[00:31:47.437 --> 00:31:50.358]  His name is William Gates III.
[00:31:50.358 --> 00:32:01.984]  And I can tell you Bill Gates has had his finger hovering over the button many times to have me killed.
[00:32:01.984 --> 00:32:06.466]  And he's had it hovering over trying to get the FBI and the Justice Department to indict me.
[00:32:07.912 --> 00:32:12.114]  And I'm not saying that to try to act all adventurous and cool.
[00:32:12.114 --> 00:32:14.174]  It's real, folks.
[00:32:14.174 --> 00:32:14.835]  But you know what?
[00:32:14.835 --> 00:32:17.836]  I have absolutely no fear of them.
[00:32:17.836 --> 00:32:31.701]  I have fear that my Heavenly Father will look at me and see that I have not given my full attack against these globalists.
[00:32:31.701 --> 00:32:33.082]  What are you doing to fight the globalists?
[00:32:33.082 --> 00:32:35.543]  I know you're fighting hard, but look at the new, redesigned, beautiful M4s.
[00:32:37.273 --> 00:32:38.754]  Nightmare confirmed!
[00:32:38.754 --> 00:32:43.176]  Planetary ruler Bill Gates announces lockdowns will never end.
[00:32:43.176 --> 00:32:48.919]  And it goes right through where he says it on video, and he's your planetary ruler through medical tyranny and big tech.
[00:32:48.919 --> 00:32:51.280]  It's all true!
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:51.841]  It's the year 2020.
[00:32:51.841 --> 00:32:58.264]  And look at the sub-headlines.
[00:32:58.264 --> 00:33:05.648]  Gates and Rockefeller Foundation documents details for a planned permanent worldwide lockdown.
[00:33:07.659 --> 00:33:11.140]  Last night Bill Gates publicly confirmed the plan is being implemented.
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:14.402]  The civilization as we know it is over.
[00:33:14.402 --> 00:33:15.622]  Go watch the eight and a half minutes.
[00:33:15.622 --> 00:33:21.104]  He says more than that.
[00:33:21.104 --> 00:33:24.645]  So let's look at a few clips of what he said in the past, just the last few months.
[00:33:24.645 --> 00:33:32.608]  Here he is a month or so ago with Anderson Cooper talking about how there will never be a cure.
[00:33:32.608 --> 00:33:34.009]  See, it's a perfect problem.
[00:33:35.342 --> 00:33:38.666]  There is no solution, but you're a guinea pig now.
[00:33:38.666 --> 00:33:47.017]  And it doesn't matter if it kills hundreds of millions of people, the lockdown, well, if it saves one person, the sickness, the death of logic, and they can only get away with this because of the death of logic.
[00:33:47.017 --> 00:33:49.000]  They're all sociopathic mathematicians.
[00:33:50.216 --> 00:34:15.394]  And the fact that the general mask wearer doesn't understand that it's not even as bad as the flu, they're counting all the flu deaths and pneumonia deaths, and heart attacks and cancer is that, the fact that they can't understand that it wasn't 2.5 million dead like they said, and that the hospitals were empty, and the fact that they can't understand that millions have already starved to death, much much worse than COVID, the fact that the public can't navigate that, and doesn't have logic,
[00:34:16.598 --> 00:34:17.819]  Just makes them so happy.
[00:34:17.819 --> 00:34:27.804]  And you look at Governor Newsom and all these psychotics, and Governor Whitmer, and they all have that same demonic look on their face because they're of one spirit.
[00:34:27.804 --> 00:34:32.407]  A lion going about seeing who it can devour.
[00:34:32.407 --> 00:34:35.569]  And a lot of people are going to sit back and go, well, there are too many people.
[00:34:35.569 --> 00:34:37.230]  I mean, I know a lot of leftists.
[00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:38.310]  They're like, yeah, let's come on.
[00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:39.231]  There are too many Africans.
[00:34:40.590 --> 00:34:43.232]  Okay, so you're going to go pick which ones to kill?
[00:34:43.232 --> 00:34:44.252]  You dumbass!
[00:34:44.252 --> 00:34:46.974]  As if you aren't going to get exterminated too, you idiot!
[00:34:46.974 --> 00:34:51.836]  We have to figure out ways to help people and build civilization and develop systems and go to the next level.
[00:34:51.836 --> 00:35:03.003]  We're not going to have a system where we kill old people and kill handicapped children and kill the black people and kill the poor people and do all this crap because the globalists want the power to do that because they like it.
[00:35:03.003 --> 00:35:08.446]  They've done direct policies to block development in Africa and to keep people dumbed down and in squalor.
[00:35:08.666 --> 00:35:10.328]  Look what they're doing to everybody here!
[00:35:10.328 --> 00:35:13.350]  It's the same thing!
[00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:25.141]  And those of you that pretend, because you're a rich Hispanic academic or white academic, the worse your black academics, most of them are on board with this, they'll tell you, we've got to get rid of the black people.
[00:35:25.141 --> 00:35:27.623]  I say this, we need to get rid of you.
[00:35:27.623 --> 00:35:28.044]  How about that?
[00:35:29.392 --> 00:35:31.113]  Oh, but don't forget the best part.
[00:35:31.113 --> 00:35:37.598]  They weaponize Africa and then open our borders and then bring in military-age men brainwashed to hate white people.
[00:35:37.598 --> 00:35:40.800]  So, because they learn to hate white people like Bill Gates.
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:43.842]  And then they bring them here to kill us!
[00:35:43.842 --> 00:35:49.425]  And the average dumbass sits there and doesn't even get three-dimensional operations like this.
[00:35:49.425 --> 00:35:53.768]  When this, these, the operations are much more complex than third-dimensional.
[00:35:53.768 --> 00:35:55.930]  They're up in fifth, sixth, seventh-dimensional operations.
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:00.242]  People like Gates can't see that high, he's just a front man for Satan.
[00:36:00.242 --> 00:36:02.003]  I can.
[00:36:02.003 --> 00:36:03.184]  And many of you can as well.
[00:36:03.184 --> 00:36:12.110]  And in fact, putting yourself against the enemy, if you want real enlightenment, for all you occultists and people out there who think you have enlightenment through obscurance, no.
[00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:16.353]  True enlightenment is through vision and opening up the light.
[00:36:16.353 --> 00:36:19.695]  But you claim you are the illuminated when you are the opposite.
[00:36:19.695 --> 00:36:24.578]  Everything you do is about bringing darkness and hiding the light.
[00:36:24.578 --> 00:36:26.159]  Because you're of your father, the devil.
[00:36:28.595 --> 00:36:36.498]  So all of us, despite the horrible things that are happening, should thank our lucky stars that we're not Bill Gates, and we're not part of his satanic order.
[00:36:36.498 --> 00:36:36.778]  You know what?
[00:36:36.778 --> 00:36:48.341]  We're going to go to break, and I'm going to come back and play the Anderson Cooper clip, and I'm going to play all the other clips where he says this is just a drill, the big bio-attack's coming, and where they admit the vaccine's making 100% of people sick, the other vaccine 80% and 700,000 are going to get sick.
[00:36:53.704 --> 00:36:54.244]  Unbelievable.
[00:36:54.244 --> 00:36:55.365]  Let's get Leo Zagami on.
[00:36:55.365 --> 00:36:56.485]  He's been on fire lately.
[00:36:56.485 --> 00:36:57.506]  He's really been breaking it down.
[00:36:57.506 --> 00:36:59.167]  But let me just spend a little bit of time on this.
[00:36:59.167 --> 00:36:59.647]  Two things.
[00:36:59.647 --> 00:37:04.849]  Before we go to break, while we run this operation, is funding.
[00:37:04.849 --> 00:37:07.230]  This is about to gone.
[00:37:07.230 --> 00:37:10.292]  This is a new product we're very, very excited about.
[00:37:10.292 --> 00:37:12.593]  This is a product that by tomorrow will be gone.
[00:37:12.593 --> 00:37:15.274]  8-pack Power Stack will either sell out today or tomorrow.
[00:37:16.291 --> 00:37:21.238]  And despite that, it's still 60% off, free shipping, 13 different pills.
[00:37:21.238 --> 00:37:23.642]  Take it in the morning and the evening, change so many people's lives.
[00:37:23.642 --> 00:37:29.450]  It became a bestseller, but because of the lockdown, the shutdown, and the supply chain breakdown, we can't get some of the ingredients, some of the pills.
[00:37:29.450 --> 00:37:31.694]  So it's got to be discontinued because we can't get it anymore.
[00:37:33.649 --> 00:37:36.010]  That's how broke down the system is.
[00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:41.492]  It's your last chance to fund the InfoWar and experience 8-pack PowerStack at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:37:41.492 --> 00:37:43.032]  Those of you that loved it, stock up.
[00:37:43.032 --> 00:37:47.974]  Those that want to give it to a loved one, give them a big boost to get them into vitamins and minerals.
[00:37:47.974 --> 00:37:49.955]  You take it in the morning, you take it in the evening.
[00:37:49.955 --> 00:37:51.475]  People experience how amazing it is.
[00:37:51.475 --> 00:37:52.316]  It changes their lives.
[00:37:52.316 --> 00:37:54.776]  They get into vitamins, they get into minerals.
[00:37:54.776 --> 00:38:01.619]  With all that's going on in the environment, the crazy things, this is the ultimate booster to the immune system and so much more.
[00:38:02.631 --> 00:38:05.992]  InfowarStore.com APAC Power Stack.
[00:38:05.992 --> 00:38:07.212]  Watch.
[00:38:07.212 --> 00:38:10.713]  Come Thursday, this product's gone, gone, gone.
[00:38:10.713 --> 00:38:13.854]  There's 600 units left of this.
[00:38:13.854 --> 00:38:16.054]  It'll probably be sold by tonight.
[00:38:16.054 --> 00:38:16.535]  And then it's gone.
[00:38:16.535 --> 00:38:19.935]  I say tomorrow to be safe because I don't want to tell you something that isn't true.
[00:38:19.935 --> 00:38:20.936]  So in a way, I kind of lie.
[00:38:20.936 --> 00:38:24.857]  I kind of always make it a little bit better than it is or add something on so to make sure I'm right.
[00:38:24.857 --> 00:38:25.957]  Two days, it's gone for sure.
[00:38:27.537 --> 00:38:28.318]  See how that works?
[00:38:28.318 --> 00:38:29.338]  Trying to tell the total truth.
[00:38:29.338 --> 00:38:32.020]  Like, it'll be sold out by today, but then I think, well, maybe it won't be, so I'll say tomorrow.
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:32.641]  But is that a lie?
[00:38:32.641 --> 00:38:34.802]  No, it's the best dead reckoning I've got.
[00:38:34.802 --> 00:38:36.423]  Separately, this is new.
[00:38:36.423 --> 00:38:41.167]  This is super strong types of industrial iodine, not for ingestion.
[00:38:41.167 --> 00:38:42.367]  Says it on the bottle.
[00:38:42.367 --> 00:38:43.969]  This is not good for you.
[00:38:43.969 --> 00:38:45.930]  This is poisonous.
[00:38:45.930 --> 00:38:47.471]  But it's super strong.
[00:38:47.471 --> 00:38:51.934]  You want something for surfaces, hard surfaces, things like that?
[00:38:51.934 --> 00:38:52.575]  This is it.
[00:38:53.769 --> 00:38:58.272]  Nascent Iodine Surface Spray with a bunch of different types of industrial iodine.
[00:38:58.272 --> 00:39:00.854]  High-powered cleaning agent.
[00:39:00.854 --> 00:39:02.675]  And boy, it's a good deal out of the gates.
[00:39:02.675 --> 00:39:04.577]  It just came in about a month ago.
[00:39:04.577 --> 00:39:06.578]  We hadn't put it on sale.
[00:39:06.578 --> 00:39:07.979]  I've been so busy.
[00:39:07.979 --> 00:39:08.019]  $19.95.
[00:39:08.019 --> 00:39:11.242]  You're not going to find a cleaning agent like this anywhere.
[00:39:11.242 --> 00:39:12.763]  And by the way, you can water this down.
[00:39:12.763 --> 00:39:14.284]  It still has an incredible effect.
[00:39:14.284 --> 00:39:16.645]  This is super strong.
[00:39:17.466 --> 00:39:18.987]  Do not ingest it.
[00:39:18.987 --> 00:39:22.710]  It's not to be confused with our X2 that has a spray nozzle on it.
[00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:23.651]  That's selling out.
[00:39:23.651 --> 00:39:26.073]  That's still discounted at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:39:26.073 --> 00:39:30.196]  And we've only got six days left, and the InfoWars total blowout because everything's basically sold out.
[00:39:30.196 --> 00:39:33.119]  A lot of stuff's going to come back in, but not until next year.
[00:39:33.119 --> 00:39:34.219]  So InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:39:34.219 --> 00:39:35.601]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[00:39:36.539 --> 00:39:40.760]  And you've got our commitment to not back down and not waver in the face of these murdering tyrants.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:45.222]  Because my boss is the big guy, and he tells me, attack, attack, attack.
[00:39:45.222 --> 00:39:47.422]  And the President tells me, press the attack as well.
[00:39:47.422 --> 00:39:50.123]  The President tells me what we're doing is, quote, perfect.
[00:39:50.123 --> 00:39:51.504]  Well, I don't know about that.
[00:39:51.504 --> 00:39:52.884]  We're trying as hard as we can.
[00:39:52.884 --> 00:39:53.704]  Stay with us.
[00:39:53.704 --> 00:39:55.245]  Take my orders from Jesus Christ.
[00:39:55.885 --> 00:40:12.590]  The Bible talks about there being ten kings of the earth that sit above the nation states and who give their power unto the one world leader, the Antichrist, and that he has a beast system that no one can buy or sell unless he has that mark in the forehead or in the palm of their hand.
[00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:19.773]  And we look back on all the warnings that were given and all just the common sense that even if you don't believe in God,
[00:40:20.473 --> 00:40:21.854]  We're good to go.
[00:40:50.453 --> 00:40:53.635]  They're just rolling it out, and a lot of people are complying with it.
[00:40:53.635 --> 00:40:55.576]  It's insane.
[00:40:55.576 --> 00:41:09.144]  For more than a hundred years, the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world government, abolish nation states, dumb down the population by taking control of education, and most importantly, taking control of Western medicine.
[00:41:09.144 --> 00:41:11.146]  Now, they had a bad name by the 1920s.
[00:41:11.146 --> 00:41:19.611]  They started converting over and funding other organizations and groups, like IBM, to continue on with their eugenics operations.
[00:41:20.311 --> 00:41:28.254]  Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates III.
[00:41:28.254 --> 00:41:30.455]  His father, of course, being the head of Planned Parenthood.
[00:41:30.455 --> 00:41:38.479]  And now, he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the world, every national health system.
[00:41:38.479 --> 00:41:40.520]  Bill Gates is in control.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.040]  They have spent
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:48.445]  A hundred plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in your body.
[00:41:48.445 --> 00:41:54.669]  This is the holy grail of their operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type of DNA in your body.
[00:41:57.113 --> 00:42:03.635]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much less in the entire world.
[00:42:03.635 --> 00:42:09.658]  InfoWars is standalone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks at hundreds of stations picking us up.
[00:42:09.658 --> 00:42:20.102]  Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense, and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda.
[00:42:20.882 --> 00:42:25.126]  That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at Band.Video.
[00:42:25.126 --> 00:42:29.590]  They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook.
[00:42:29.590 --> 00:42:44.925]  That's why it's so precious, because if censorship expands to everyone, which it is now, with AI monitoring and controlling what you can say and do, it's going to be the OACs like Band.Video and the now redesigned InfoWars.com that become more and more important, which they are.
[00:42:45.345 --> 00:42:52.911]  And the enemy is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now.
[00:42:52.911 --> 00:42:54.832]  They're coming after everyone.
[00:42:54.832 --> 00:42:56.753]  So spread the word now.
[00:42:56.753 --> 00:43:03.738]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[00:43:03.738 --> 00:43:09.182]  I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because that was un-American.
[00:43:09.182 --> 00:43:11.544]  Now the media admits that almost every app
[00:43:11.704 --> 00:43:11.824]  Yeah.
[00:43:27.435 --> 00:43:38.502]  Turn on and listen to what you're saying just like Siri or Alexa do and then putting databases, transcripts of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever.
[00:43:38.502 --> 00:43:43.765]  Your phone is spying on you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information.
[00:43:43.765 --> 00:43:46.887]  This is the Global Chinese Communist Social Credit Score.
[00:43:46.887 --> 00:43:53.671]  Get your protection privacy pockets at InfoWarscore.com and cut Big Brother off dead in his filthy tracks.
[00:43:53.671 --> 00:43:54.872]  InfoWarscore.com
[00:43:59.052 --> 00:44:01.670]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:19.444 --> 00:44:20.564]  Big Brother.
[00:44:20.564 --> 00:44:22.385]  Mainstream media.
[00:44:22.385 --> 00:44:24.246]  Government cover-ups.
[00:44:24.246 --> 00:44:25.966]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:44:25.966 --> 00:44:27.627]  Well, so does he.
[00:44:27.627 --> 00:44:33.589]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:44.993]  The sound of bulls knocked at your door.
[00:44:44.993 --> 00:44:46.154]  Now you've got some company.
[00:44:48.092 --> 00:44:50.933]  Bill Gates is coming nearer.
[00:44:50.933 --> 00:44:53.814]  The four horsemen of death he rides.
[00:44:53.814 --> 00:44:57.655]  He comes to take your life.
[00:44:57.655 --> 00:45:00.936]  On to the dead of night.
[00:45:00.936 --> 00:45:03.397]  You'll see the four horsemen ride.
[00:45:03.397 --> 00:45:06.978]  So choose your death and die.
[00:45:06.978 --> 00:45:09.379]  Oh yeah!
[00:45:09.379 --> 00:45:11.399]  You've been dying since the day you were born.
[00:45:11.399 --> 00:45:13.400]  You know it's all been planned.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.001]  A sinner once, a sinner twice.
[00:45:15.001 --> 00:45:16.181]  You need no confession now.
[00:45:17.585 --> 00:45:23.967]  Because now you've got the fight of your life.
[00:45:23.967 --> 00:45:28.909]  All right, let's go ahead and talk about cold hard facts.
[00:45:28.909 --> 00:45:36.531]  What does a post-industrial world mean?
[00:45:36.531 --> 00:45:39.732]  Well, Karl Marx talked about it.
[00:45:39.732 --> 00:45:40.833]  Engels talked about it.
[00:45:40.833 --> 00:45:41.733]  Isaac Asimov
[00:45:42.978 --> 00:45:57.669]  He wrote about it, and he later admitted that it was actually part of the Futurist Society that he was involved in, that it was actually planning some of the things he put in his books back in the 40s and 50s and 60s that were being introduced to the public.
[00:45:57.669 --> 00:46:04.354]  And the plan is to get robots and automation up to a point where humans don't have to work anymore.
[00:46:04.354 --> 00:46:09.177]  You've heard about, oh, by 2020 there'll be a two-day work week, but now you work more than ever.
[00:46:09.177 --> 00:46:10.158]  Because they decided
[00:46:11.476 --> 00:46:21.405]  When Bill Joy wrote about this in Wired Magazine in 2000, and why the future doesn't need us, they decided that you're obsolete, that you're not essential.
[00:46:21.405 --> 00:46:31.334]  They decided they're not going to let you sit around on that cruise ship like Wally, enjoying yourself, and weighing 500 pounds.
[00:46:31.334 --> 00:46:32.595]  They're just going to entertain you.
[00:46:33.507 --> 00:46:48.816]  Put robots in charge and have you sign agreements to be sterilized and then to go on certain drugs and basically anesthetize yourself until you agree to go to a euthanasia facility and be killed.
[00:46:48.816 --> 00:46:52.518]  Notice you see that in films like Toilet Green.
[00:46:52.518 --> 00:46:56.500]  They admit they've been implanting those messages for this point.
[00:46:56.500 --> 00:46:59.262]  But see, you still wanted to go to a human to have your car fixed.
[00:47:00.236 --> 00:47:01.877]  You still wanted to go grow a garden.
[00:47:01.877 --> 00:47:06.682]  You were going real sustainable, not what they were selling as sustainable.
[00:47:06.682 --> 00:47:08.383]  You were going away from their system.
[00:47:08.383 --> 00:47:09.804]  You were getting into fitness.
[00:47:09.804 --> 00:47:11.246]  You were getting into organic.
[00:47:11.246 --> 00:47:13.147]  You were becoming spiritual again.
[00:47:13.147 --> 00:47:14.609]  They didn't know what to do!
[00:47:16.237 --> 00:47:32.392]  And so they said, we'll have a global shutdown, claiming it's a virus, that'll give global government power to implement it, we'll have to have tracking systems for it, and then we'll decide what's essential and what's not, and only say big corporations can stay open to consolidate power, and they've all doubled their money roughly.
[00:47:32.392 --> 00:47:34.974]  Gates, Bezos, all of them the last year.
[00:47:34.974 --> 00:47:36.876]  Because it's their war on us.
[00:47:36.876 --> 00:47:37.937]  It's their big gamble.
[00:47:39.235 --> 00:47:40.216]  It's their big move.
[00:47:40.216 --> 00:47:41.296]  It's their big plan.
[00:47:41.296 --> 00:47:43.257]  Day one, it was about surveilling us.
[00:47:43.257 --> 00:47:45.399]  Day one, it was about making us obsolete.
[00:47:45.399 --> 00:47:49.421]  Day one, it was about destroying us.
[00:47:49.421 --> 00:47:51.442]  Because that's what conquerors do, they believe.
[00:47:51.442 --> 00:47:53.163]  They believe in social Darwinism.
[00:47:53.163 --> 00:48:05.291]  They believe by doing this, they're flexing their evolutionary muscles and culling off the weak, while they set up the whole system to make us as weak as possible, and to make us not stand up to them.
[00:48:10.043 --> 00:48:11.184]  Let's go to some of these clips.
[00:48:11.184 --> 00:48:21.234]  Here is Gates talking about how the pandemic never ends, you see, because they picked something, the common cold, that he now made a patented synthetic version of that spreads really good.
[00:48:21.234 --> 00:48:31.323]  So you're all suspect and the plan is that he controls everything and he directs through corporations and blue cities and blue states and other globalist controlled areas around the world.
[00:48:31.323 --> 00:48:34.927]  And then it doesn't matter what nation leaders do because they've got corporate control.
[00:48:37.415 --> 00:48:38.736]  It's very simple.
[00:48:38.736 --> 00:48:42.958]  And the corporate minions go along with it because they get short-term power out of it.
[00:48:42.958 --> 00:48:45.299]  Even though their kids are getting fried by 5G.
[00:48:45.299 --> 00:48:47.039]  Even though they're drinking fluoride.
[00:48:47.039 --> 00:48:51.582]  They don't care because they feel like they're in on the big plan.
[00:48:51.582 --> 00:48:58.685]  And that's what's really sick is I thought in the 26 years I've been on air that until the last five years or so that most low-level people didn't know.
[00:48:59.974 --> 00:49:04.155]  But instead, as we exposed this and others exposed it, the globalists said, thank you!
[00:49:04.155 --> 00:49:08.537]  More people have joined us now because they're scared and they want to be on the winning team!
[00:49:08.537 --> 00:49:17.800]  How do you get on a winning team that is for total depopulation and destruction and an attack on the species itself?
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:21.321]  Oh, what, you've got a nice boat and a nice house for another decade?
[00:49:21.321 --> 00:49:23.202]  What scum!
[00:49:23.202 --> 00:49:28.624]  But here he is with Anderson Cooper, whose brother killed himself.
[00:49:29.889 --> 00:49:40.161]  Who he himself as a little boy was fed into the human sacrifice grid of pedophile sex, the evidence points towards.
[00:49:40.161 --> 00:49:45.608]  One of the heirs to the richest families on earth.
[00:49:45.608 --> 00:49:48.932]  Here he is with Bill Gates saying it never ends, it never ends, here it is.
[00:49:50.428 --> 00:49:58.030]  You've talked about some of the sophisticated tools, the therapeutics that are coming and that some are here.
[00:49:58.030 --> 00:50:01.931]  Can you just talk a little bit, let's talk about Regeneron.
[00:50:01.931 --> 00:50:04.292]  You've been optimistic about it.
[00:50:04.292 --> 00:50:08.993]  It got, obviously, a big endorsement from President Trump because he was able to receive it.
[00:50:08.993 --> 00:50:11.174]  He's calling it a cure.
[00:50:11.174 --> 00:50:13.835]  He's calling on regulators to give it an emergency use authorization.
[00:50:13.835 --> 00:50:16.855]  Do you support the idea of the emergency use authorization?
[00:50:16.855 --> 00:50:18.716]  And I assume it's not a cure.
[00:50:20.205 --> 00:50:25.270]  No, well, the word cure is a bit of an overpromise.
[00:50:25.270 --> 00:50:31.076]  You know, that makes it sound it looks like it works for everyone and the whole concern about this disease should go away.
[00:50:31.076 --> 00:50:33.899]  And that's the last thing we want people to think about.
[00:50:34.813 --> 00:50:36.133]  Oh yeah, because it doesn't ever go away.
[00:50:36.133 --> 00:50:37.134]  The lockdown never ends.
[00:50:37.134 --> 00:50:37.994]  We just tuned in.
[00:50:37.994 --> 00:50:39.374]  He said, oh, at least 10 years.
[00:50:39.374 --> 00:50:42.295]  And then there's never a normal, you'll never have entertainment again.
[00:50:42.295 --> 00:50:46.276]  I mean, we're going to decide what is essential activity and what isn't.
[00:50:46.276 --> 00:50:47.416]  See how that works?
[00:50:47.416 --> 00:50:51.877]  The computer, the iPhone, the droid, the AI, it decides what you do.
[00:50:51.877 --> 00:50:56.198]  And this artificial intelligence isn't some godlike independent intelligence.
[00:50:56.198 --> 00:51:01.219]  It's a programmed system of a straitjacket that makes you behave the way it wants you to behave.
[00:51:05.776 --> 00:51:07.337]  So let's play this first clip.
[00:51:07.337 --> 00:51:11.140]  Gates, we don't want politicians saying which COVID drugs.
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:12.021]  This is from Meet the Press.
[00:51:12.021 --> 00:51:15.004]  Then we have Bill Gates on the next bio attack that's coming.
[00:51:15.004 --> 00:51:17.305]  Oh, the next one, because this was a bio attack from him.
[00:51:17.305 --> 00:51:21.329]  And he's confronted about vaccine side effects.
[00:51:21.329 --> 00:51:23.691]  Let's go to the next clip.
[00:51:23.691 --> 00:51:25.092]  This is the rules there.
[00:51:25.092 --> 00:51:31.057]  If this is where we are, does it basically mean that the vaccine is our only hope of getting back to normal?
[00:51:32.645 --> 00:51:42.915]  Yeah, well, society should be able to have things like schooling that get a priority versus certain more entertainment-related things.
[00:51:42.915 --> 00:51:46.919]  And I guess, you know, politicians will show... Okay, so that's good.
[00:51:46.919 --> 00:51:47.679]  We played that earlier.
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.021]  Then he goes into how it never ends.
[00:51:50.021 --> 00:51:51.081]  Ten years.
[00:51:51.081 --> 00:51:52.642]  You've got to have a vaccine that he produces.
[00:51:52.642 --> 00:51:53.602]  Here's the next one.
[00:51:53.602 --> 00:51:55.483]  Bill Gates' bio attack is next.
[00:51:55.483 --> 00:51:59.925]  Here he is on Colbert four months ago, months after I said this is a drill.
[00:51:59.925 --> 00:52:03.667]  It's a test with a simulant live virus to make us all guilty that he owns.
[00:52:04.247 --> 00:52:07.789]  So now the common cold will say you have it, so we're all suspect forever.
[00:52:07.789 --> 00:52:09.570]  That's a problem that can never be fixed.
[00:52:09.570 --> 00:52:10.831]  Remember how many times I said that?
[00:52:10.831 --> 00:52:11.631]  Hundreds.
[00:52:11.631 --> 00:52:13.592]  Now he just announced it last night.
[00:52:13.592 --> 00:52:19.075]  But here he is at the time saying, terrorists with a bigger bio-attack, more deadly are coming.
[00:52:19.075 --> 00:52:24.438]  So this is all a lockdown test to train you to stay in your home when the real bio-weapon comes and kills your ass.
[00:52:24.438 --> 00:52:26.760]  Here it is.
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:31.122]  What else are we not listening to that we need to take action on now?
[00:52:31.122 --> 00:52:32.383]  Well, the...
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:41.523]  The idea of a bioterrorist attack is kind of the nightmare scenario because there, a pathogen with a high death rate would be picked.
[00:52:41.523 --> 00:53:01.051]  Now the good news is, not going to depress you, it's tough enough right now, that most of the work we're going to do to be ready for Pandemic 2, I call this Pandemic 1, most of the work we'll do to be ready for that are also the things we need to do to minimize the threat of bioterrorism.
[00:53:01.493 --> 00:53:01.853]  That's right.
[00:53:01.853 --> 00:53:06.257]  First you get the chains on, you get her strapped down to the bed, then you start the raping.
[00:53:06.257 --> 00:53:07.598]  It's all about raping.
[00:53:07.598 --> 00:53:10.381]  Literally for your own genetics and then actually killing you slowly.
[00:53:10.381 --> 00:53:12.262]  Then Bill Gates laughs about it because he says he wants to kill you.
[00:53:12.262 --> 00:53:13.403]  I mean, that wants to save the Earth.
[00:53:13.403 --> 00:53:14.624]  He's a savior.
[00:53:14.624 --> 00:53:21.651]  Here he is confronted on CBS News about the fact that most people taking the vaccine are getting sick and that doesn't even work.
[00:53:21.651 --> 00:53:23.392]  Which he had said last night doesn't work either.
[00:53:23.392 --> 00:53:24.033]  It doesn't matter.
[00:53:24.033 --> 00:53:25.594]  That means you get more shots from him.
[00:53:25.594 --> 00:53:26.515]  Again, he's your boss.
[00:53:26.515 --> 00:53:27.135]  He's your God.
[00:53:27.135 --> 00:53:27.416]  Here it is.
[00:53:28.493 --> 00:53:30.534]  Moderna vaccines sound concerning.
[00:53:30.534 --> 00:53:31.674]  We looked.
[00:53:31.674 --> 00:53:42.057]  After the second dose, at least 80% of participants experienced a systemic side effect, ranging from severe chills to fevers.
[00:53:42.057 --> 00:53:46.899]  So, are these vaccines safe?
[00:53:46.899 --> 00:53:52.181]  Well, the FDA not being pressured will
[00:53:53.618 --> 00:53:54.580]  Look hard at that.
[00:53:54.580 --> 00:54:04.096]  The FDA is the gold standard of regulators, and their current guidance on this, if they stick with that, is very, very appropriate.
[00:54:06.974 --> 00:54:11.558]  You know, the side effects were not super severe.
[00:54:11.558 --> 00:54:20.465]  That is, it didn't cause permanent health problems for the things that are... You know, Moderna did have to go with a fairly high dose.
[00:54:20.465 --> 00:54:29.012]  And so, you know, to get the antibodies... Again, why do they have to have the new vaccine they're coming out with as a vector using measles?
[00:54:29.012 --> 00:54:33.676]  Because the body doesn't recognize COVID is strong enough to have an autoimmune response because it's so broad.
[00:54:33.676 --> 00:54:34.997]  See how the scam works?
[00:54:34.997 --> 00:54:35.698]  See how it works?
[00:54:46.099 --> 00:54:57.703]  You notice that over and over again, the United Nations, our supposed controllers and bosses, the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with, has come out and said nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19.
[00:54:57.703 --> 00:55:00.764]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's a total lie.
[00:55:00.764 --> 00:55:01.084]  You get a
[00:55:01.284 --> 00:55:02.125]  We're good to go.
[00:55:20.905 --> 00:55:24.728]  For saying that there's hope and that people should have their vitamins and their minerals.
[00:55:24.728 --> 00:55:31.153]  Well now Fauci's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin D3 and C. He should have also added zinc.
[00:55:31.153 --> 00:55:34.415]  Because the NIH website says you die without zinc.
[00:55:34.415 --> 00:55:43.903]  But it's good news that he's being pressured now to admit the reality because so many doctors and nurses and experts in nutrition have been exposing the fact that he's not been warning the public to get their vitamins.
[00:55:46.713 --> 00:55:54.018]  InfoWars is a archetypal classic example of free, independent, organic resistance against tyranny.
[00:55:54.018 --> 00:55:55.459]  You built InfoWars.
[00:55:55.459 --> 00:55:56.980]  You spread the word.
[00:55:56.980 --> 00:55:58.181]  You prayed for us.
[00:55:58.181 --> 00:55:59.562]  You bought the products.
[00:55:59.562 --> 00:56:00.722]  You called in.
[00:56:00.722 --> 00:56:02.083]  You made recommendations.
[00:56:02.083 --> 00:56:04.745]  InfoWars is as much yours as it is mine.
[00:56:04.745 --> 00:56:12.911]  And that's why the enemy is so upset that under the deplatforming, under all the DNC lawsuits, under all the attack, in many ways, we've become stronger.
[00:56:12.911 --> 00:56:16.413]  With Band.Video, redesigned InfoWars, with all of our great crew,
[00:56:16.893 --> 00:56:22.857]  With documentary films and 10 hours of live radio and TV a day.
[00:56:22.857 --> 00:56:24.198]  We are the resistance.
[00:56:24.198 --> 00:56:25.078]  You are the resistance.
[00:56:25.078 --> 00:56:34.784]  So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for you to continue to spread the word about it and to continue for you to support because this is something we built together.
[00:56:34.784 --> 00:56:36.485]  It's not just a national treasure.
[00:56:36.485 --> 00:56:40.908]  It's a treasure worldwide against the tyrants and they know it and they can't stand it.
[00:56:40.908 --> 00:56:44.590]  And as everything we talked about comes true, our credibility only goes up together.
[00:56:44.590 --> 00:56:45.491]  So I salute you all.
[00:56:49.123 --> 00:56:51.739]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:57:08.564 --> 00:57:27.889]  The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided to award the Nobel Peace Prize for 2020 to the World Food Program for its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas.
[00:57:29.069 --> 00:57:41.315]  And for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict.
[00:57:41.315 --> 00:57:48.898]  I am delighted by the decision of the Nobel Committee to award this year's Nobel Peace Prize to the United Nations World Food Programme.
[00:57:48.898 --> 00:57:55.561]  I warmly congratulate David Bisley, WFP Executive Director, and the entire staff of the World Food Programme on this recognition.
[00:57:56.101 --> 00:57:58.083]  Instead of coronavirus, the hunger will kill us.
[00:57:58.083 --> 00:57:59.845]  A global food crisis looms.
[00:57:59.845 --> 00:58:01.026]  That was back in April.
[00:58:01.026 --> 00:58:02.088]  Oh, but don't worry, the U.N.
[00:58:02.088 --> 00:58:05.892]  has got an award for fighting food as a weapon, as they use it as a weapon.
[00:58:06.377 --> 00:58:12.959]  The United Nations is warning the coronavirus crisis has put the world on the brink of a hunger pandemic.
[00:58:12.959 --> 00:58:18.021]  265 million people could face acute food shortages by the end of the year.
[00:58:18.021 --> 00:58:21.362]  That is double last year's projections.
[00:58:21.362 --> 00:58:25.683]  This is what hunger looks like when it spills over into the streets.
[00:58:25.683 --> 00:58:31.485]  A food stampede in Kenya's largest slum, leaving scores injured and two dead.
[00:58:31.485 --> 00:58:33.006]  If you want to be exploited,
[00:58:34.218 --> 00:58:43.481]  And if you want to have many more body bags, then you do it.
[00:58:43.481 --> 00:58:50.022]  If you don't want many more body bags, then you refrain from politicizing it.
[00:58:50.022 --> 00:59:02.326]  Well, I think we've got to recognize that some of these UN bodies, and the WHO is an iconic example, have actually been subject to a hostile takeover by the Chinese state.
[00:59:02.836 --> 00:59:06.266]  In recent years, the rest of us have underinvested in
[00:59:07.122 --> 00:59:14.868]  And therefore, they have been bought cheaply by China, which is now using them for its political and strategic purposes.
[00:59:14.868 --> 00:59:15.969]  That's how crazy this is.
[00:59:15.969 --> 00:59:33.504]  I mean, the UN publicly runs the lockdown, publicly says they want to depopulate, publicly are caught adding steroids to the vaccines, publicly are running these blockades, publicly are blocking good medicines going into Africa, publicly blew up Libya, publicly overthrew all these other countries to make it destabilized, then publicly organized the collapse of our borders.
[00:59:34.204 --> 00:59:34.844]  But they're the good guys.
[00:59:54.133 --> 01:00:01.477]  These new allegations concern a report that three young females were raped by three members of a MINUSCA military contingent.
[01:00:01.477 --> 01:00:09.481]  The troop contributing country has been asked to indicate within 10 days if it intends to investigate the allegation itself.
[01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:17.185]  Should the member state decline to investigate or fail to respond, the United Nations will rapidly conduct its own investigation.
[01:00:18.609 --> 01:00:21.650]  We're looking at a formulaic takeover.
[01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:25.472]  And I harp on COVID as the catalyst for the takeover.
[01:00:25.472 --> 01:00:29.594]  It's a big move at an office that could change the way a lot of Americans work.
[01:00:29.594 --> 01:00:35.977]  A tech company in Wisconsin is offering to implant tiny microchips into its employees.
[01:00:35.977 --> 01:00:43.240]  Many of the employees, including the CEO, will voluntarily have the microchips implanted into their bodies.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:47.322]  And they're calling it, I'm not kidding here, a chips and salsa party.
[01:00:48.282 --> 01:00:55.467]  If we don't oppose this revolution that they're trying to bring in and then normalize, we don't have any hope into the future.
[01:00:55.467 --> 01:01:00.189]  Microsoft announced no more Microsoft buildings, no more people coming in.
[01:01:00.189 --> 01:01:01.130]  You must work from home.
[01:01:01.130 --> 01:01:06.233]  Well, that's part of phasing you out with the AI and showing you just how obsolete you are.
[01:01:06.233 --> 01:01:12.437]  All right, folks, this is hardcore stuff we're covering, but it's the reality.
[01:01:12.437 --> 01:01:14.238]  And humanity can come together and defeat this.
[01:01:15.543 --> 01:01:18.044]  The permanent house arrest of freedom is what we're talking about.
[01:01:18.044 --> 01:01:18.844]  It's all out in the open.
[01:01:18.844 --> 01:01:20.424]  It's at Man.Video.
[01:01:20.424 --> 01:01:22.605]  You can decide to fight back, or you can just roll over and die.
[01:01:22.605 --> 01:01:31.428]  Carlos Zapata, a veteran, a patriot, very well-spoken fellow who's been standing up to tyranny, and who explained that a violent revolution is coming and the left keeps trying to starve us out.
[01:01:31.428 --> 01:01:33.068]  Under the siege operation, he'll be joining us.
[01:01:33.068 --> 01:01:35.669]  Dan Lyman has big international headlines.
[01:01:35.669 --> 01:01:39.070]  German ministers are saying, in full force, broke huge story of a giant
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.521]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[01:01:42.521 --> 01:01:43.761]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[01:01:43.761 --> 01:01:44.402]  Is your city too safe?
[01:02:03.177 --> 01:02:04.938]  Well, not anymore!
[01:02:04.938 --> 01:02:07.318]  Introducing Democrats!
[01:02:07.318 --> 01:02:16.281]  Politicians so incompetent, they'll fill your neighborhood with riots, looting, rampant violence, and even homelessness!
[01:02:16.281 --> 01:02:21.302]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old-fashioned stupidity!
[01:02:21.302 --> 01:02:23.683]  No more pesky law and order!
[01:02:23.683 --> 01:02:26.224]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe!
[01:02:27.407 --> 01:02:32.189]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back, and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground!
[01:02:32.189 --> 01:02:33.530]  But wait!
[01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:42.554]  Vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes, and more taxes!
[01:02:42.554 --> 01:02:45.595]  Democrats, bringing chaos right to your front door!
[01:03:05.905 --> 01:03:12.150]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:03:13.314 --> 01:03:26.899]  Okay, I just did an hour live standing up here in studio for the TV viewers, and what Bill Gates came out and said last night on national television blew me away so hard that I am just in a blind rage right now.
[01:03:26.899 --> 01:03:36.583]  I mean, he said permanent lockdown, at least 10 years, forced inoculations, total control, the whole world collapsing, financial destruction to save
[01:03:37.603 --> 01:03:39.744]  One-tenth of one percent of one percent.
[01:03:39.744 --> 01:03:42.106]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:03:42.106 --> 01:03:44.748]  Their whole admitted battle plan.
[01:03:44.748 --> 01:03:49.331]  What do you as listeners think about this, ladies and gentlemen?
[01:03:49.331 --> 01:03:55.134]  We have Carlos Zapata, who showed up a few months ago in California and explained this is military siege.
[01:03:55.134 --> 01:03:59.357]  The lockdowns are destroying small businesses, causing mass suicide.
[01:03:59.357 --> 01:04:01.698]  He said that we, the people, will take back civilization.
[01:04:01.698 --> 01:04:03.820]  He's going to be joining us for a second visit.
[01:04:04.821 --> 01:04:22.486]  I'm not somebody that wants physical confrontation, but when they're shutting your economy off to consolidate it, when they're trying to forcibly inoculate you, they're trying to implode the third world and starve them to death, to then flood us with the third world as a weapon, we're under military, corporate, spiritual attack.
[01:04:22.486 --> 01:04:23.966]  Economic attack.
[01:04:23.966 --> 01:04:28.607]  And we have a right and a duty to say no and to stand up against it.
[01:04:28.607 --> 01:04:30.048]  The question is, how do we do that?
[01:04:30.048 --> 01:04:31.188]  Well, first we warn the people.
[01:04:32.605 --> 01:04:38.270]  And we expose who's behind it and we try to get Congress and the President and others to act and the Governors to say no to this.
[01:04:38.270 --> 01:04:46.878]  That's why it's so sick to see the Governor of Texas basically becoming Gavin Newsom Jr., the mini-me of Gavin Newsom.
[01:04:46.878 --> 01:04:48.500]  Paul Joseph Watson's coming up as well.
[01:04:48.500 --> 01:04:50.702]  Dan Lyman just broke a huge story.
[01:04:50.702 --> 01:04:55.346]  But I think this special report we put out is very important and I'm gonna play this and then I'm gonna come back and
[01:04:56.121 --> 01:05:04.364]  Get the latest election news, the latest Democrat plan for civil war they're now publicly announcing.
[01:05:04.364 --> 01:05:10.526]  And of course what the Democrats are talking about, packing the Supreme Court, what that would look like, it's all coming up.
[01:05:10.526 --> 01:05:18.949]  But first, we just played the permanent house arrest of freedom, the permanent martial law lockdown announced by Bill Gates.
[01:05:20.384 --> 01:05:24.165]  You know, I got great guests and I'm glad we got these guests, but man, today's the day.
[01:05:24.165 --> 01:05:32.268]  I should probably just open the phones up and think, what do you think about Gates being in charge of everything and saying he wants to depopulate you, but boy, he's got this shot he really wants you to take.
[01:05:32.268 --> 01:05:35.749]  This new vaccine that reprograms your cells and making so many people sick.
[01:05:35.749 --> 01:05:37.909]  I mean, how obvious is this?
[01:05:37.909 --> 01:05:39.770]  How ridiculous is this?
[01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:42.931]  But again, it's got to be hidden in plain view because they've noticed.
[01:05:44.571 --> 01:05:47.753]  If you hide it in plain view, people aren't scared of it.
[01:05:47.753 --> 01:05:51.034]  And they acclimate to it, and they cozy up to it, and they go along with it.
[01:05:51.034 --> 01:05:56.917]  But it's up to those of us that are leaders and see through this to say no.
[01:05:56.917 --> 01:05:57.957]  So here's the report.
[01:05:57.957 --> 01:06:01.639]  Medical tyranny is upending your existence.
[01:06:01.639 --> 01:06:06.281]  I mean, this is how 21st century warfare operates.
[01:06:06.281 --> 01:06:07.922]  This is how the system takes over.
[01:06:07.922 --> 01:06:09.163]  This is how it executes.
[01:06:09.163 --> 01:06:13.425]  This is how it gets it done.
[01:06:13.425 --> 01:06:14.285]  And it's happening now.
[01:06:16.787 --> 01:06:25.395]  And it's sick that Bill Gates and the Rockefeller Foundation in lockstep and in event 201 and other documents admit all of it.
[01:06:25.395 --> 01:06:26.756]  That's what's so painful.
[01:06:26.756 --> 01:06:28.438]  I try to argue with people I know.
[01:06:28.438 --> 01:06:33.122]  Like I've got family that are smart people.
[01:06:34.773 --> 01:06:53.466]  And they aren't even Democrats, but when they see the news saying there is no treatment, there is no therapeutic, eight months ago, and I'm like, vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, here's the NIH website, plus it's known, if you have these vitamins at high levels, you basically can't get viral infections because they can't manufacture inside the mitochondria.
[01:06:53.466 --> 01:06:57.408]  It's like, what are you, a virologist?
[01:06:57.408 --> 01:07:00.870]  What are you, a biologist?
[01:07:00.870 --> 01:07:04.273]  And I'm like, what I am is somebody that can read the medical literature.
[01:07:05.851 --> 01:07:17.441]  And man, I can't tell you how many family members and how many lawyers I know and one of them guys, a couple of them are federal agents.
[01:07:17.441 --> 01:07:20.364]  They come to me and they go, God, I thought you were full of it, Alex.
[01:07:20.364 --> 01:07:22.826]  Fauci just said, you got to have vitamin D or C or you'll die.
[01:07:22.826 --> 01:07:30.053]  I mean, I'm not a botanist, but I know plants need sunlight or they die.
[01:07:32.591 --> 01:07:39.964]  I'm not a farmer, but I know plants need water or they die.
[01:07:39.964 --> 01:07:41.166]  It's called essential.
[01:07:42.383 --> 01:07:47.506]  And I go back to that because if the public, see because the public has shown a problem.
[01:07:47.506 --> 01:07:50.187]  Hey, there's this problem, society's shutting down.
[01:07:50.187 --> 01:07:53.469]  People believe, well there must not be a solution or they wouldn't be doing this.
[01:07:53.469 --> 01:07:55.771]  I get why people have cognitive dissonance.
[01:07:55.771 --> 01:07:59.513]  They automatically go, well, Alex, come on.
[01:07:59.513 --> 01:08:05.236]  Medical doctors go, 100% of patients that do this, inhaled steroid, it's an autoimmune response, they're safe.
[01:08:05.236 --> 01:08:08.938]  Trump got it, feels great, he obviously already had infections, they cleaned out his blood, great.
[01:08:11.305 --> 01:08:12.325]  That's why Trump feels so good.
[01:08:12.325 --> 01:08:14.746]  He obviously had pre-existing conditions.
[01:08:14.746 --> 01:08:17.508]  He got all this, you know, souped up transfusion.
[01:08:17.508 --> 01:08:18.808]  Basically a blood transfusion he got.
[01:08:18.808 --> 01:08:21.929]  He's feeling great.
[01:08:21.929 --> 01:08:25.131]  When we told the doctors, I'll do anything, they said, yes sir, we'll do it.
[01:08:25.131 --> 01:08:26.071]  I was wrong about what was going on.
[01:08:26.071 --> 01:08:27.151]  It looks like they knew what they were doing.
[01:08:27.151 --> 01:08:29.252]  But regardless, here's the report.
[01:08:29.252 --> 01:08:30.533]  We'll come back and get into the news.
[01:08:31.836 --> 01:08:38.920]  People ask questions about the deaths that have occurred due to particular vaccine and this always gets blown up in the media.
[01:08:38.920 --> 01:08:53.027]  One should be able to give a very factual account of what exactly has happened and what the cause of deaths are, but in most cases there's some obfuscation at that level and therefore there's less and less trust then in the system.
[01:08:53.527 --> 01:08:58.031]  It was the UN back in December of last year said, hey, vaccines are killing people, they're untested.
[01:08:58.031 --> 01:08:59.973]  We need to pause vaccines.
[01:08:59.973 --> 01:09:02.515]  The public doesn't believe in them, the doctors don't believe in them.
[01:09:02.515 --> 01:09:06.118]  But they said, but we're just giving them by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told what to do.
[01:09:06.118 --> 01:09:10.182]  So even the UN, the global government system itself is just a puppet.
[01:09:10.862 --> 01:09:13.644]  And what they say is God.
[01:09:13.644 --> 01:09:19.347]  Halting funding for the WHO during a world health crisis is as dangerous as it sounds.
[01:09:19.347 --> 01:09:21.869]  The world needs them now more than ever.
[01:09:21.869 --> 01:09:26.592]  Well, the truth is the group actually needs Gates more than ever.
[01:09:26.592 --> 01:09:27.412]  With the U.S.
[01:09:27.412 --> 01:09:31.415]  taking a pause, he'll now be their largest active donor.
[01:09:31.415 --> 01:09:31.915]  That's right.
[01:09:31.915 --> 01:09:37.979]  One out of every 10 bucks that the WHO gets is from the world's second wealthiest man.
[01:09:38.601 --> 01:09:46.165]  Again, my name is Dr. Tapper and I am no stranger to you as this is my third time here addressing regulations and mask mandates.
[01:09:46.165 --> 01:09:52.768]  Imagine a virus so deadly and severe that you have to have a test done to find out whether or not you've had it.
[01:09:52.768 --> 01:09:59.071]  You guys are basing these numbers on positive cases and not hospitalizations or deaths.
[01:09:59.071 --> 01:10:01.032]  That's what you should be basing those off of.
[01:10:01.032 --> 01:10:06.455]  The numbers are hyperinflated by false positives and the never-ending doom and gloom from the mainstream media.
[01:10:06.955 --> 01:10:17.862]  If the mask mandate turns into a vaccine mandate, you will not be allowed to go back to work, earn a paycheck, renew your driver's license, or function in everyday society without proof of the vaccination.
[01:10:17.862 --> 01:10:22.906]  We had draconian bills sweeping the nation last year coming after our medical freedoms.
[01:10:22.906 --> 01:10:25.207]  And then the coronavirus came.
[01:10:25.207 --> 01:10:28.389]  The Trojan horse to implement this tyrannical agenda.
[01:10:28.389 --> 01:10:30.310]  They say you don't need vitamin D?
[01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:32.372]  Then you can't say as a medical doctor you need vitamin D.
[01:10:33.288 --> 01:10:35.089]  They say you don't need vitamin C?
[01:10:35.089 --> 01:10:37.771]  The FBI will SWAT team you!
[01:10:37.771 --> 01:10:49.019]  It was a special setup for this raid with the FBI putting on PPE as they went inside this medical clinic with a search warrant seeking medical records and physical evidence.
[01:10:49.719 --> 01:11:01.803]  The investigation includes allegations that the clinic provided fraudulent treatments for COVID-19 and that the clinic did not observe proper protocols to protect patients and staff from the virus.
[01:11:01.803 --> 01:11:08.606]  The FBI spokesperson would not say what specific treatment they were investigating, except to say it was on the clinic website.
[01:11:08.606 --> 01:11:10.266]  We found this posting.
[01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:13.668]  We've been using intravenous vitamin C therapy to treat COVID-19.
[01:11:14.568 --> 01:11:17.810]  and non-hospitalized patients with great results.
[01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:22.673]  We've been told our whole life that vitamin D correlates with a strong immune system.
[01:11:22.673 --> 01:11:30.078]  Grothman points to studies that suggest vitamin D can reduce your chances of contracting COVID or the severity of your symptoms.
[01:11:30.078 --> 01:11:34.641]  He says he's tried for months to get the CDC and other experts to talk about it.
[01:11:34.641 --> 01:11:39.064]  Then this week, one of the nation's leading infectious disease experts did.
[01:11:39.064 --> 01:11:44.268]  Dr. Anthony Fauci mentioned vitamin D during an Instagram Live with actress Jennifer Garner.
[01:11:44.428 --> 01:11:51.751]  Well, if you are deficient in vitamin D, that does have an impact on your susceptibility to infection.
[01:11:51.751 --> 01:11:56.714]  But now Fauci's saying, oh wait, okay, we'll drop the charges, Fauci's God.
[01:11:56.714 --> 01:11:59.475]  So Fauci's God, Bill Gates is God, the UN's God.
[01:12:00.745 --> 01:12:02.326]  None of us have any rights.
[01:12:02.326 --> 01:12:09.372]  But now even the UN's head envoy for global COVID-19 response comes out and says, we've got to stop this.
[01:12:09.372 --> 01:12:11.874]  This is causing millions to die already.
[01:12:11.874 --> 01:12:13.595]  Hundreds of millions are going to die.
[01:12:13.595 --> 01:12:18.919]  And it's already going to be devastating, devastating to our economy.
[01:12:18.919 --> 01:12:19.420]  It's going to put...
[01:12:20.240 --> 01:12:21.362]  Millions of people out of work.
[01:12:21.362 --> 01:12:23.805]  It's going to bankrupt tens of millions in the Western world.
[01:12:23.805 --> 01:12:26.168]  But the third world, it's already a death sentence.
[01:12:26.168 --> 01:12:27.410]  Millions are already dead.
[01:12:27.410 --> 01:12:33.478]  And I want the left and the Democrats and Fauci and Gates to know, we know they're behind it.
[01:12:33.478 --> 01:12:35.580]  So they can be discredited and exposed for
[01:12:36.687 --> 01:12:37.788]  The future isn't coming.
[01:12:37.788 --> 01:12:38.008]  It's here.
[01:12:55.647 --> 01:13:04.191]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence is going to be your most valuable asset.
[01:13:04.191 --> 01:13:07.752]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[01:13:07.752 --> 01:13:20.478]  The world being built by the technocrats and the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total
[01:13:21.678 --> 01:13:24.219]  And complete dehumanization.
[01:13:24.219 --> 01:13:30.361]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[01:13:30.361 --> 01:13:34.182]  This is their stated goal.
[01:13:34.182 --> 01:13:42.425]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[01:13:42.925 --> 01:13:44.446]  Let me turn this around.
[01:13:44.446 --> 01:13:49.869]  You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips with it.
[01:13:49.869 --> 01:13:51.970]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[01:13:51.970 --> 01:13:55.832]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[01:13:55.832 --> 01:14:00.154]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[01:14:00.154 --> 01:14:08.639]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from Infowarsstore.com.
[01:14:08.999 --> 01:14:25.604]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[01:14:25.604 --> 01:14:36.648]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[01:14:37.148 --> 01:14:45.632]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[01:14:45.632 --> 01:14:54.536]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:14:54.536 --> 01:14:57.177]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:07.307 --> 01:15:24.131]  National German television and major newspapers are crediting Infowars Europe with exposing big stings against George Soros-funded Antifa-run invasion points in Greece.
[01:15:24.131 --> 01:15:35.734]  Lyman was then tipped off by sources and exclusively got the footage of the raid on an Antifa stronghold that the city of Berlin had handed over to the terrorists.
[01:15:36.601 --> 01:15:45.887]  Dan Lyman of NewsWars.com and EuropeWars.com will be joining us coming up next segment.
[01:15:45.887 --> 01:15:49.710]  But again, it scares the hell out of me that if we didn't have
[01:15:50.796 --> 01:16:04.065]  Paul Joseph Watson, and Rob Dew, and Kit Daniels, and Adon Salazar, and Kellan McGreen, and all the people, I don't know, and Jamie White, and Ben, and a lot of folks that want their full names on there, maybe they do.
[01:16:04.065 --> 01:16:11.470]  But just all the great people we've got, so many times we break it, and then a week later I see it in Breitbart.
[01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:15.673]  Or a week later I see it on CNN, or a week later I see the President saying it.
[01:16:15.673 --> 01:16:16.394]  Now I gotta say,
[01:16:17.461 --> 01:16:20.524]  A lot of times I see stuff at Gateway Pundit before we get it.
[01:16:20.524 --> 01:16:22.066]  And by the way, that's a good feeling.
[01:16:22.066 --> 01:16:23.667]  I'm like, yeah, good.
[01:16:23.667 --> 01:16:28.592]  If they blow us up or put me in prison, there's somebody else out there doing original stuff.
[01:16:28.592 --> 01:16:31.575]  But we're kicking ass.
[01:16:31.575 --> 01:16:32.797]  And we're very thankful to all of you.
[01:16:34.192 --> 01:16:34.912]  Please support us.
[01:16:34.912 --> 01:16:41.775]  We've got the InfoWars total blowout sale that has to end in six days because a lot of the products are selling out like 8-pack PowerStack.
[01:16:41.775 --> 01:16:43.175]  Today or tomorrow it will sell out.
[01:16:43.175 --> 01:16:45.336]  Probably, I would say, sometime late tonight.
[01:16:45.336 --> 01:16:47.217]  We can't get the 13 different pills.
[01:16:47.217 --> 01:16:47.917]  We can get a lot of them.
[01:16:47.917 --> 01:16:49.077]  We can't get some of them.
[01:16:49.077 --> 01:16:52.919]  So you can't make a product anymore when you can't get the product anymore.
[01:16:54.139 --> 01:16:56.801]  APEC PowerStack's been very, very popular.
[01:16:56.801 --> 01:16:57.401]  It's over.
[01:16:57.401 --> 01:17:01.043]  It's gone because of the lockdown, because of the supply chain breakdown.
[01:17:01.043 --> 01:17:09.248]  We're trying to reformulate something that's just as good, but it's dangerous to do a complex product that has 13 different pills in a world like this right now.
[01:17:09.248 --> 01:17:15.571]  So we've gotten really spoiled in our supply chain to be able to have something this amazing.
[01:17:15.571 --> 01:17:18.453]  Your last chance to get it, Infowarstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[01:17:18.453 --> 01:17:19.454]  And separately,
[01:17:24.033 --> 01:17:33.336]  Again, we have a whole bunch of items that are for sale very, very soon.
[01:17:33.336 --> 01:17:37.538]  Brain Force Plus is the final run.
[01:17:38.732 --> 01:17:41.815]  Because we've decided to upgrade it and make it even better.
[01:17:41.815 --> 01:17:44.157]  And every time you reformulate, you've got to change the name.
[01:17:44.157 --> 01:17:46.579]  So, it was first BrainForce, then BrainForce Plus.
[01:17:46.579 --> 01:17:52.784]  Well, if you like BrainForce Plus, and everybody loves it, it's our best seller overall, it's 50% off free shipping, selling out.
[01:17:52.784 --> 01:17:56.347]  Ultimate Krill Oil, 50% off free shipping, even though it's selling out.
[01:17:56.347 --> 01:17:59.169]  Survival Vitality, 50% off free shipping.
[01:17:59.169 --> 01:18:02.131]  Survival Shield X2 Spray Bottle.
[01:18:02.131 --> 01:18:03.593]  It's the high-quality, ingestible,
[01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:09.552]  High-end in a spray bottle, 33% off, plus free shipping.
[01:18:09.552 --> 01:18:15.936]  Extender-wise, final run, 60% off, plus free shipping, because it's hard to get what's in it as well.
[01:18:15.936 --> 01:18:17.677]  The supplier's broken down.
[01:18:17.677 --> 01:18:20.019]  Knockout, 50% off, plus free shipping.
[01:18:20.019 --> 01:18:23.381]  That's $14.95 with the best sleep aid out there.
[01:18:23.381 --> 01:18:26.943]  Melatonin costs more, and it's got melatonin in it, but it has seven other ingredients.
[01:18:27.895 --> 01:18:32.322]  So just a bottle of melatonin with the same dose costs more than this, because they add all that markup in there.
[01:18:32.322 --> 01:18:33.203]  We don't.
[01:18:33.203 --> 01:18:36.568]  Turbo Force, 10-hour clean energy, plus free Chevy 50% off.
[01:18:36.568 --> 01:18:39.954]  All t-shirts, 1776, like Arrested Gates and Fauci.
[01:18:39.954 --> 01:18:41.416]  Mask-free zone.
[01:18:41.416 --> 01:18:42.838]  All SRL products.
[01:18:44.318 --> 01:19:00.912]  SRL Products is, I was in a medical clinic with a medical doctor and a lot of them sell nutraceutical grade supplements and I talked to them and almost had a deal and then they got scared away because of the politics and they said, but hey, here's my supplier that makes it and they had some really great proprietary things.
[01:19:00.912 --> 01:19:03.895]  We came out with three products and I just never promoted it.
[01:19:04.778 --> 01:19:08.860]  I've been so busy, so under attack, it's been out like six months.
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:18.463]  I want you to enjoy SRL products because we wanted to come out with stuff that wasn't ours, that wasn't our company, that's diversified because of deplatforming.
[01:19:18.463 --> 01:19:26.146]  I wanted to come out with a line of nutraceuticals that somebody else controlled so I could do advertisement and be able to sell them because they don't let me advertise on the internet on most sites.
[01:19:26.826 --> 01:19:28.567]  And that's what SRL Labs products are.
[01:19:28.567 --> 01:19:29.547]  There's three of them.
[01:19:29.547 --> 01:19:36.051]  They're all 60% off, plus free shipping, because we're just clearing everything out to have raw, hard cash to fund ourselves into the new year.
[01:19:36.051 --> 01:19:38.132]  Because if the Democrats win, they're coming for everybody.
[01:19:38.132 --> 01:19:41.513]  We've got to stay on air as long as possible.
[01:19:41.513 --> 01:19:44.155]  Nascent Iodine Surface Spray now, not for ingestion.
[01:19:44.155 --> 01:19:46.116]  It's 50% off, plus free shipping.
[01:19:46.116 --> 01:19:48.977]  And even more at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:19:48.977 --> 01:19:50.678]  And then separately, and then I'm going to shove about this.
[01:19:52.233 --> 01:20:00.680]  More than half of all Americans plan to stockpile food and other essentials for chaotic months ahead in big national polls.
[01:20:00.680 --> 01:20:05.083]  Big article by Michael Snyder, Economic Collapse blog on that.
[01:20:05.083 --> 01:20:11.288]  Other big articles about food supply breakdowns around the world.
[01:20:11.288 --> 01:20:13.590]  Again, I think you should go to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:15.652]  It has the full spectrum of high-quality, storable foods.
[01:20:16.783 --> 01:20:16.903]  That's
[01:20:35.285 --> 01:20:40.829]  They're full spectrum of products, all of it right there on the site, and they're in our back end.
[01:20:40.829 --> 01:20:45.353]  They take the orders daily and ship it out to you as fast as they possibly can.
[01:20:45.353 --> 01:20:55.241]  One year, six months, one month, specialty foods, all of it, water filtration, air filtration, the very best prices you're going to find anywhere at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139, then separately.
[01:20:58.402 --> 01:21:00.643]  Support our local AM and FM stations.
[01:21:00.643 --> 01:21:02.164]  Tell folks about the stations.
[01:21:02.164 --> 01:21:03.085]  Become a sponsor.
[01:21:03.085 --> 01:21:04.306]  Support the sponsors.
[01:21:04.306 --> 01:21:07.608]  Or, is your church exposing abortion and the Satanists like we are?
[01:21:07.608 --> 01:21:09.609]  Tithe!
[01:21:09.609 --> 01:21:11.370]  Even though it's not tax exempt.
[01:21:11.370 --> 01:21:13.752]  Send $100 a month, $20 a month, whatever you can.
[01:21:13.752 --> 01:21:16.293]  You got the money, $1,000 a month to that local station.
[01:21:16.293 --> 01:21:24.639]  I can tell you, most stations pick us up at night, they get good ratings, they put us on earlier, and then they get donations and support, they put us on live.
[01:21:24.639 --> 01:21:26.320]  Most stations that carry us end up
[01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:30.681]  Carrying us at night and then carrying us live later because of the support.
[01:21:30.681 --> 01:21:32.301]  So you've done a great job again.
[01:21:32.301 --> 01:21:43.124]  And that was our secret weapon when they tried to de-platform us was the almost 200 plus radio stations and over 100 TV and cable stations and growing.
[01:21:43.124 --> 01:21:45.685]  So please support those local stations.
[01:21:45.685 --> 01:21:49.506]  At least call and thank them and then tell people daily about the broadcast.
[01:21:49.506 --> 01:21:50.967]  I'm done plugging now.
[01:21:50.967 --> 01:21:52.187]  Probably for the rest of the transmission.
[01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:56.761]  But that's how we fund ourselves, and it's such an incredible time to be alive.
[01:21:56.761 --> 01:21:59.122]  I'm so thankful that you funded us and kept us here on air.
[01:21:59.122 --> 01:22:03.983]  Okay.
[01:22:03.983 --> 01:22:07.264]  Gosh, there's so much to cover.
[01:22:07.264 --> 01:22:08.244]  So much to get to.
[01:22:08.244 --> 01:22:11.605]  You know, I love how Trump's coming out against Dr. Fauci.
[01:22:11.605 --> 01:22:15.486]  I love how Trump is exposing how he's a Bill Gates fraud.
[01:22:15.486 --> 01:22:18.827]  And how Gates is attacking Trump now.
[01:22:18.827 --> 01:22:22.268]  This is good to get Gates out in the open with 20 days out from the election.
[01:22:23.447 --> 01:22:26.628]  And Trump just needs to completely put the brass knuckles on now.
[01:22:26.628 --> 01:22:35.010]  He's taken the gloves off, but now he's put the brass knuckles on.
[01:22:35.010 --> 01:22:39.412]  So we've got some clips of Trump talking about that as well.
[01:22:39.412 --> 01:22:41.052]  In fact, let's go out to break.
[01:22:41.052 --> 01:22:42.072]  Well, there's not time now.
[01:22:42.072 --> 01:22:43.853]  We're going to come back and get to this.
[01:22:43.853 --> 01:22:46.754]  Trump says he was right about damaging lockdowns.
[01:22:47.955 --> 01:22:56.221]  Acosta responds, nursing home residents say they'd rather die of COVID than be the loneliness that's actually killing them in record numbers.
[01:22:56.221 --> 01:22:58.283]  It's all coming up.
[01:22:58.283 --> 01:23:03.487]  Meanwhile, what will happen if Democrats pack the Supreme Court?
[01:23:03.487 --> 01:23:13.634]  But first, Dan Lyman, again, and Europe Wars, and just what all of our writers is doing, is absolutely essential and beautiful and strong.
[01:23:13.634 --> 01:23:17.517]  You saw how people like
[01:23:19.960 --> 01:23:25.842]  Nigel Farage go and show the flotillas of boats coming in with illegal aliens, Islamicists.
[01:23:25.842 --> 01:23:27.703]  And the police come and threaten him!
[01:23:27.703 --> 01:23:30.163]  Because it's effective, it's truthful, it shows the invasion.
[01:23:30.163 --> 01:23:33.725]  Well, Dan Lyman is doing the same thing and we just are really, really excited.
[01:23:33.725 --> 01:23:36.466]  He's interviewed high-level members of the German government.
[01:23:36.466 --> 01:23:37.206]  It's all on video.
[01:23:37.206 --> 01:23:45.849]  It's all at EuropeWars.com, a URL that is so powerful if you want to defeat the enemy that you should share on your email list and on your Twitter and Facebook.
[01:23:45.849 --> 01:23:48.109]  It's not as banned as InfoWars, so share it.
[01:23:48.109 --> 01:23:49.270]  EuropeWars.com.
[01:23:51.118 --> 01:24:02.087]  In fiction, supervillains are known as supervillains because they have gigantic, huge, global plans that are incredibly well thought out and incredibly complex.
[01:24:02.087 --> 01:24:09.413]  And if I had told you a year ago, back in October of 2019, that a powerful billionaire who controls the UN would roll out a global
[01:24:09.753 --> 01:24:11.174]  You tell me that's crazy.
[01:24:11.174 --> 01:24:12.515]  You tell me that's a dystopia.
[01:24:12.515 --> 01:24:15.077]  You tell me that's some type of science fiction comic book.
[01:24:32.048 --> 01:24:34.109]  But in reality, it really did happen.
[01:24:34.109 --> 01:24:41.971]  His name is Bill Gates, and he's the head of a major eugenics consortium that his father and mother set up more than 60 years ago.
[01:24:41.971 --> 01:24:45.172]  And we're living in this world Bill Gates has built.
[01:24:45.172 --> 01:24:47.933]  Until we start saying no, we are Bill Gates's property.
[01:24:47.933 --> 01:24:49.253]  It's time to expose Bill Gates.
[01:24:50.779 --> 01:24:57.304]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much less in the entire world.
[01:24:57.304 --> 01:25:03.349]  InfoWars is standalone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks at hundreds of stations picking us up.
[01:25:03.349 --> 01:25:13.797]  Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense, and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda.
[01:25:14.557 --> 01:25:18.800]  That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at Band.Video.
[01:25:18.800 --> 01:25:23.264]  They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook.
[01:25:23.264 --> 01:25:38.596]  That's why it's so precious, because if censorship expands to everyone, which it is now, with AI monitoring and controlling what you can say and do, it's going to be the OACs like Band.Video and the now redesigned InfoWars.com that become more and more important, which they are.
[01:25:39.016 --> 01:25:47.012]  And the enemy is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now.
[01:25:47.012 --> 01:25:48.495]  They're coming after everyone.
[01:25:48.495 --> 01:25:49.437]  So spread the word now.
[01:25:50.968 --> 01:25:53.890]  2020ElectionsCenter.com.
[01:25:53.890 --> 01:26:10.838]  Just type it in one time, you've got it saved right there in your browser, and then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple platforms, but most importantly, via text message, email, or by word of mouth, because they have banned the links to banned video.
[01:26:10.838 --> 01:26:19.422]  But 2020ElectionsCenter.com is a clone of the site, the exact same links, the exact same videos where you can comment, you can share them, everything.
[01:26:19.422 --> 01:26:19.943]  The system
[01:26:20.963 --> 01:26:25.646]  Is censoring because of the power of the people overrode them four years ago?
[01:26:25.646 --> 01:26:31.971]  Trump has finally figured this out, and since he's gonna take action once re-elected against Big Tech, I mean, he's moderating the situation.
[01:26:31.971 --> 01:26:36.433]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're gonna sit here and cry because he has to take an action.
[01:26:36.433 --> 01:26:47.381]  We the people are taking action now, and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com, and checking out the new, redesigned InfoWars.com and sharing that with him.
[01:26:47.381 --> 01:26:48.581]  Oh, that really upsets him.
[01:26:48.581 --> 01:26:49.102]  Oh, yeah.
[01:26:53.692 --> 01:26:56.297]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[01:27:17.632 --> 01:27:25.681]  Okay, folks, Alex Jones here, back live, and this next story is really important because it shines a light on so many things.
[01:27:27.213 --> 01:27:33.816]  The fact that Europe is under invasion by UN-funded flotillas, also backed by George Soros.
[01:27:33.816 --> 01:27:36.838]  Trump has cut off a lot of that funding in the last few years.
[01:27:36.838 --> 01:27:41.460]  Got us out of the United Nations treaty that lets the UN actually direct what we do with refugees.
[01:27:41.460 --> 01:27:47.463]  But they've gotten more refugees in the last few months than they've gotten in the last year in the UK from these boats.
[01:27:47.463 --> 01:27:48.884]  Greece is being flooded, you name it.
[01:27:48.884 --> 01:27:54.186]  But InfoWars focused on sting operations last week and two weeks ago.
[01:27:54.186 --> 01:27:54.927]  InfoWars Europe.
[01:27:56.307 --> 01:27:58.669]  With video and reporters and all of it.
[01:27:58.669 --> 01:28:08.756]  And that's been credited with getting enough news in Europe to get the German government to respond to a whole nest of Antifa that have been living in a compound for more than a decade.
[01:28:10.404 --> 01:28:19.549]  So Dan Lyman is an American writer, political analyst, and cultural commentator after years fronting a rock band and answering the call for true journalism in defense of Western civilization.
[01:28:19.549 --> 01:28:23.772]  He's ex-Citizen Analyst on Twitter and EuropeWars.com.
[01:28:23.772 --> 01:28:30.736]  I want to play him introducing a high-level member of German Parliament, one of the leaders of one of the major nationalist German parties.
[01:28:31.596 --> 01:28:34.560]  And then he's got all the big tours, shows Antifa being busted.
[01:28:34.560 --> 01:28:38.104]  All this is exclusive because the media won't cover it.
[01:28:38.104 --> 01:28:43.070]  But because of Europe Wars breaking the blockade, and InfoWars amplifying it, it's now known.
[01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:48.656]  So here's just a few minutes of the footage, the tons of it, at EuropeWars.com.
[01:28:48.656 --> 01:28:49.017]  Here it is.
[01:28:51.505 --> 01:28:53.266]  Dan Lyman with InfoWars Europe.
[01:28:53.266 --> 01:28:56.709]  I am here in Berlin, Germany with MP Peter Bystrom.
[01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:58.450]  He's taking me for a tour of the city right now.
[01:28:58.450 --> 01:29:01.432]  We're actually in what they're calling the Antifa Hive.
[01:29:01.432 --> 01:29:08.136]  We are in front of actually where some of the NGOs that we've recently reported on out of Greece that were recently busted there.
[01:29:08.136 --> 01:29:11.198]  The Greek authorities took down a big NGO network there.
[01:29:11.198 --> 01:29:13.860]  And some of the NGOs are actually based right here.
[01:29:13.860 --> 01:29:17.242]  And so they've taken me here today just to see where the operation actually happens.
[01:29:17.242 --> 01:29:21.425]  So I'm here with Peter and he can tell us a little bit more about exactly what's going on and what we're looking at right now.
[01:29:21.425 --> 01:29:21.825]  Right here.
[01:29:21.825 --> 01:29:23.606]  Okay, Dan, so let's have a look.
[01:29:23.606 --> 01:29:28.227]  Come on.
[01:29:28.227 --> 01:29:28.747]  So here we are.
[01:29:28.747 --> 01:29:31.688]  We're right at the entrance to a couple of these NGO operations here.
[01:29:31.688 --> 01:29:35.089]  And as you can see, that's kind of listed as who operates out of here.
[01:29:35.089 --> 01:29:38.290]  And Peter's going to tell us exactly what goes on in this building here.
[01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:39.970]  Well, welcome in Berlin.
[01:29:39.970 --> 01:29:41.511]  Welcome to Kreuzberg.
[01:29:41.511 --> 01:29:42.971]  Welcome to Meringhof.
[01:29:42.971 --> 01:29:44.791]  Meringhof is the location.
[01:29:44.791 --> 01:29:47.712]  This is the, yeah, rattle hole.
[01:29:47.712 --> 01:29:49.613]  Here are all those NGOs.
[01:29:50.782 --> 01:29:58.487]  They have their headquarters here, who are doing the human trafficking in the Mediterranean and other stuff.
[01:29:58.487 --> 01:30:05.232]  Obviously, when we can look on the walls, they are all very left-extreme.
[01:30:05.232 --> 01:30:14.559]  And what is the next problem is that they are supported by the German government, by the European Union, by the Municipal Council of Berlin.
[01:30:15.279 --> 01:30:17.541]  Which is red, red, green.
[01:30:17.541 --> 01:30:20.564]  It means communist, socialist and green socialist.
[01:30:20.564 --> 01:30:23.707]  So let's just have a look on this.
[01:30:23.707 --> 01:30:27.450]  Who is here?
[01:30:27.450 --> 01:30:30.693]  We see a tag.
[01:30:30.693 --> 01:30:35.717]  We see many lawyers who are defending them.
[01:30:35.717 --> 01:30:38.220]  All the left extremists, you know.
[01:30:38.220 --> 01:30:41.483]  And if you want to see the political connections.
[01:30:46.511 --> 01:30:51.655]  One can see them very nicely here on this poster.
[01:30:51.655 --> 01:31:00.142]  Because it's saying the Greens, the Socialist Yalts connected to the Socialist Party in Germany.
[01:31:00.142 --> 01:31:02.384]  Again, the Green Yalts.
[01:31:02.384 --> 01:31:06.547]  So the connections to the official politics are very strong here.
[01:31:06.547 --> 01:31:08.289]  And we all are financing this.
[01:31:09.699 --> 01:31:15.401]  So I promised you to bring you to the next hotspot of Berlin.
[01:31:15.401 --> 01:31:21.023]  So you see, maybe now you even heard where we are going.
[01:31:21.023 --> 01:31:22.003]  This is the Riga.
[01:31:22.003 --> 01:31:27.705]  Schaß is very famous because of its squads.
[01:31:27.705 --> 01:31:31.847]  The left extremists occupying houses.
[01:31:44.365 --> 01:31:46.766]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:31:46.766 --> 01:31:51.328]  We are in the middle of the hotspots of the left extremists.
[01:31:51.328 --> 01:32:00.433]  They are occupying those houses for 30 years and now this is the first time I can remember that the authorities are cleaning up one of those houses.
[01:32:03.345 --> 01:32:22.555]  Alright, so Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com, there's tons of footage, radio listeners have got to go there and see it, because there's a big raid on, I guess you'd call it CHOP Germany, or Chas Deutschland, or Chas Berlin, and incredible footage of them actually raiding this communist cesspit.
[01:32:22.555 --> 01:32:25.997]  Dan Lyman, another amazing job, you've knocked it out of the park, tell us what's happened.
[01:32:27.475 --> 01:32:28.996]  Yeah, it's great to be back at home.
[01:32:28.996 --> 01:32:31.077]  It was definitely an eventful weekend, though, in Berlin.
[01:32:31.077 --> 01:32:32.618]  I definitely got more than I bargained for.
[01:32:32.618 --> 01:32:39.381]  I didn't know what to expect when I went at the invitation of the Alternative für Deutschland party, which is Alternative for Germany.
[01:32:39.381 --> 01:32:43.764]  They are the third largest party in Germany and the main opposition party.
[01:32:43.764 --> 01:32:47.266]  If there was a Trumpian party in Germany, that's who they would be.
[01:32:47.266 --> 01:32:50.467]  And they invited me up there for a variety of experiences.
[01:32:50.467 --> 01:32:53.489]  And what you're seeing in that footage was just a small portion of the weekend.
[01:32:54.932 --> 01:32:55.954]  You were there, brother.
[01:32:55.954 --> 01:32:57.536]  Wow.
[01:32:57.536 --> 01:33:03.785]  Because this fellow and others credit you and your reporting for the chain reaction that led to actually the raids.
[01:33:05.393 --> 01:33:12.538]  Well, to be perfectly clear about that, the raids are connected, but they're not exactly was the focus of our reporting.
[01:33:12.538 --> 01:33:30.031]  They're kind of a side story that was a bonus in addition, because what we did last week or the week before, we broke a story about the NGO networks that were operating in the Mediterranean that had been basically migrant trafficking there, according to the Greek authorities.
[01:33:30.031 --> 01:33:33.494]  The Greek authorities busted them up and discovered that a couple of these NGOs
[01:33:34.014 --> 01:33:43.599]  We're actually based out of Berlin, and as I have come to call them, the Antifa of the sea, that's how these people operate, these NGO operatives.
[01:33:43.599 --> 01:33:47.261]  They are technically based in Berlin, so we broke that story.
[01:33:47.261 --> 01:33:53.984]  We were the first international outlet to pick that up out of the Greek media.
[01:33:53.984 --> 01:34:00.467]  I have a great source down in Greece who fed me a lot of great tips and showed me, direct me in the right direction to get the accurate information.
[01:34:00.467 --> 01:34:01.488]  We broke that wide open.
[01:34:02.108 --> 01:34:04.449]  And the Germans were so shocked.
[01:34:04.449 --> 01:34:10.873]  I don't raise this about credit, but Nigel Farage goes out, no one else is doing it, it actually turns the tide.
[01:34:10.873 --> 01:34:13.235]  No one else is doing it, you go out, turns the tide.
[01:34:13.235 --> 01:34:15.536]  I'm just telling everybody, everybody should be doing this.
[01:34:15.536 --> 01:34:17.597]  Breitbart should be doing this.
[01:34:17.597 --> 01:34:21.860]  You know, any independent media should just go out and expose what's happening.
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:25.102]  Because it becomes a huge story, it's important, and it changes the world.
[01:34:25.102 --> 01:34:27.143]  But no one's taking action, you've done it.
[01:34:28.778 --> 01:34:44.916]  Exactly, and what we actually triggered, that chain reaction, ended up being that the German politicians for AFD were able to, particularly MP Peter Beister on Bistrom, he was able to confront the Foreign Minister on the floor of Parliament about these NGO operations and ask him about that.
[01:34:45.436 --> 01:34:54.184]  And apparently the foreign minister either pretended or truly did not know anything about the bus or the fact that Berlin-based NGOs had been implicated.
[01:34:54.184 --> 01:34:58.068]  And so these NGOs are closely intertwined with Antifa.
[01:34:58.068 --> 01:34:59.069]  They swap in and out.
[01:34:59.069 --> 01:35:01.431]  Their members could be considered of both, let's say.
[01:35:01.431 --> 01:35:03.873]  Sure, the Antifa are like the brown shirts for the Nazis.
[01:35:03.873 --> 01:35:04.634]  They're the enforcers.
[01:35:05.805 --> 01:35:08.367]  Sure, and they are the operatives out internationally.
[01:35:08.367 --> 01:35:13.632]  They're working in the Med to import thousands of migrants from the third world into Europe.
[01:35:13.632 --> 01:35:22.641]  And so he was able to confront them about that, and they were so happy for that to gain some international coverage, because the German media has basically blocked it all out.
[01:35:22.641 --> 01:35:24.042]  They're not covering it at all.
[01:35:24.042 --> 01:35:25.884]  And he was able to force that confrontation.
[01:35:26.184 --> 01:35:27.125]  There's a paradox.
[01:35:27.125 --> 01:35:32.051]  The fact that they've suppressed it so much means anyone resisting it explodes that much bigger.
[01:35:32.051 --> 01:35:36.235]  That's what I'm trying to tell listeners is everybody needs to go expose this.
[01:35:36.235 --> 01:35:44.805]  I mean the no-go zones all of it it's a big giant like Tony Montana says about Miami it's a big giant you know what just waiting to be I mean we need to expose this.
[01:35:46.127 --> 01:35:46.987]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:35:46.987 --> 01:35:53.649]  So we were able to expose the NGOs and you saw some of the footage of us actually visiting where they're headquartered there in Berlin.
[01:35:53.649 --> 01:36:04.872]  And we were only able to stay there for about four or five minutes before Antifa informants who were watching the entrance were already notifying comrades, colleagues, wherever else, to come down.
[01:36:04.872 --> 01:36:12.194]  And I was briefed ahead of time that we would have a maximum of five minutes before we needed to clear out of the scene because we could put ourselves at risk of danger.
[01:36:12.881 --> 01:36:14.642]  Well, Dan, listen.
[01:36:14.642 --> 01:36:25.489]  That's why I try to get funding for InfoWars, because you do it on a shoestring budget, and we're going to get you even more funding, because every time I just send a few coins your direction, you go out and kick total ass, and I just want you to expand Europe Wars.
[01:36:25.489 --> 01:36:26.430]  You're doing an incredible job.
[01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:29.492]  I know you've got another site, too, that you run separately.
[01:36:29.492 --> 01:36:33.014]  Let's talk about that when we come back for the battle for America.
[01:36:33.014 --> 01:36:34.575]  As well, we want to support what you're doing there.
[01:36:34.575 --> 01:36:37.997]  We just sleep good at night knowing Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com is there.
[01:36:37.997 --> 01:36:40.239]  Listeners, you've got to hammer that URL out.
[01:36:40.839 --> 01:36:43.103]  Because the reporting there is second to none.
[01:36:43.103 --> 01:36:45.446]  It's the only place you're going to find this critical intel.
[01:36:45.446 --> 01:36:45.847]  Stay with us.
[01:37:00.322 --> 01:37:04.605]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[01:37:04.605 --> 01:37:08.107]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[01:37:08.107 --> 01:37:11.370]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[01:37:11.370 --> 01:37:14.932]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[01:37:14.932 --> 01:37:17.174]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[01:37:17.174 --> 01:37:18.575]  I suggest Band.Video.
[01:37:19.255 --> 01:37:24.718]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[01:37:24.718 --> 01:37:33.202]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[01:37:33.202 --> 01:37:39.905]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[01:37:39.905 --> 01:37:42.707]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[01:37:49.377 --> 01:37:54.884]  This is your last chance to get a Peck Power Stack, and I'm really bummed out about that.
[01:37:54.884 --> 01:38:00.051]  It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did order it loved it and started reordering it.
[01:38:00.051 --> 01:38:02.374]  They spread the word and became one of our best sellers.
[01:38:02.374 --> 01:38:04.977]  But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown,
[01:38:05.317 --> 01:38:11.499]  Because there's 13 different formulas in 8-Pak PowerStack, we are unable to secure it anymore.
[01:38:11.499 --> 01:38:20.122]  This is the highest-end AM-PM pack system you're going to find, where you take half the pills in the morning, half the tablets and pills and gel caps at night.
[01:38:20.122 --> 01:38:20.582]  It's amazing.
[01:38:20.582 --> 01:38:29.025]  I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this gets people to remember to take it, and that's why it's having such a great effect, because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing.
[01:38:29.025 --> 01:38:32.126]  So it's your last chance to get 8-Pak PowerStack at InfoWareStore.com.

[01:38:51.003 --> 01:38:55.427]  The globalists are very very honest about their planetary goals.
[01:38:55.427 --> 01:39:04.155]  They want private corporate governance above nation-states, above religious institutions, above the family.
[01:39:04.155 --> 01:39:06.977]  They want total corporate power.
[01:39:06.977 --> 01:39:14.684]  There was a great film back in the early 1970s called Rollerball with James Caan and it's based on a novel set in the year 2020 and in the book
[01:39:17.646 --> 01:39:20.188]  You have megacorporations that control the planet.
[01:39:20.188 --> 01:39:22.829]  There are no longer nation-states.
[01:39:22.829 --> 01:39:27.332]  There are only cities that are the capitals of the corporations.
[01:39:27.332 --> 01:39:34.876]  Well, if you actually read what the Deimos Group and the CFR, Toronto Commission, say in the year 2020, that is their endgame.
[01:39:34.876 --> 01:39:35.577]  That is their goal.
[01:39:36.397 --> 01:39:43.799]  So we're talking about a Hunger Games type scenario here run by very, very, very ruthless people who see us as chattel.
[01:39:43.799 --> 01:39:48.220]  They're using COVID-19 as their takeover strategy and Communist China as their model.
[01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:50.020]  We must reject it now.
[01:39:50.020 --> 01:39:54.561]  Introducing InfoWars Life Pure Turmeric Extract.
[01:39:54.561 --> 01:39:57.102]  This is taken under the tongue.
[01:39:57.102 --> 01:39:58.242]  It is pure turmeric.
[01:39:59.275 --> 01:40:08.482]  It goes together very well with our body's ultimate tumeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the stomach and intestines.
[01:40:08.482 --> 01:40:14.327]  This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach.
[01:40:14.327 --> 01:40:16.489]  So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[01:40:16.949 --> 01:40:20.171]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates.
[01:40:20.171 --> 01:40:22.012]  And our first product got rave reviews.
[01:40:22.012 --> 01:40:24.133]  We've now been testing this out for several months.
[01:40:24.133 --> 01:40:26.314]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies.
[01:40:26.314 --> 01:40:27.675]  Some like bodies better.
[01:40:27.675 --> 01:40:31.817]  For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory action and so much more.
[01:40:31.817 --> 01:40:32.997]  And they fund the InfoWare.
[01:40:32.997 --> 01:40:37.620]  So get our new liquid turmeric extract exclusively at InfoWareStore.com today.
[01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:38.360]  An additional 25% off.

[01:40:42.122 --> 01:40:47.205]  Turmeric is renowned for what it does for all of our bodies, for inflammation and so much more.
[01:40:47.205 --> 01:40:53.228]  Get yours today at InfoWarsLife.com.
[01:40:53.228 --> 01:41:03.033]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:03.033 --> 01:41:09.296]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:41:15.827 --> 01:41:28.046]  So this is footage of the informants.
[01:41:29.056 --> 01:41:31.637]  They're out there reporting on people that they're covering.
[01:41:31.637 --> 01:41:33.398]  We've been informed on.
[01:41:33.398 --> 01:41:35.098]  We are actually leaving on short notice.
[01:41:35.098 --> 01:41:46.783]  I was going to give you more of a tour, but they have an informant there at the door, and she's already let Antifa know that we are here, about our presence, and they're probably calling in the troops, so to speak.
[01:41:46.783 --> 01:41:49.484]  So we are on our way out.
[01:41:49.484 --> 01:41:52.366]  And because they're a violent terrorist group, you've got to pull out of the area.
[01:41:52.366 --> 01:41:54.366]  So Dan Lyman, continue on.
[01:41:54.366 --> 01:41:55.627]  The point I'm getting at here is,
[01:41:57.372 --> 01:42:02.873]  These communists get away with all this thuggery worldwide with George Soros' funding because people don't stand up.
[01:42:02.873 --> 01:42:05.234]  But when you do stand up, incredible things happen.
[01:42:05.234 --> 01:42:09.915]  We actually outnumber them 10,000 to 1, but we just keep bowing down, we keep submitting.
[01:42:09.915 --> 01:42:16.757]  Or the average man out there, the average woman, doesn't see themselves in the role of actually going on this adventure, this quest.
[01:42:16.757 --> 01:42:18.078]  But you've done that.
[01:42:18.078 --> 01:42:23.159]  Tell folks about your own quest and what else you've been witnessing in Europe under George Soros' UN invasion.
[01:42:25.134 --> 01:42:25.635]  Well, sure.
[01:42:25.635 --> 01:42:32.382]  Yeah, you know, to go back to that scene there, you know, and it goes to the point that you're saying people feel like they can't stand up to this.
[01:42:32.382 --> 01:42:35.605]  Unfortunately, the police as well feel like they can't stand up to this.
[01:42:35.605 --> 01:42:37.667]  So they do have their hands tied as they do.
[01:42:37.667 --> 01:42:40.170]  We've seen that in the United States as well.
[01:42:40.170 --> 01:42:43.213]  So in some cases, the police can't take any action.
[01:42:43.793 --> 01:43:09.514]  Again, Santifa in certain neighborhoods without first clearing it through a chain of command and that chain of command tends to be Sympathetic or in in the in the court in the corner of Antifa or left-wing extremists so that even the police can't do a lot never mind the average person and as we have seen when the average person does try to do something they either get doxxed or beat up or prosecuted by the state so we are living in a state of
[01:43:09.978 --> 01:43:10.599]  I don't know.
[01:43:32.509 --> 01:43:33.730]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:43:33.730 --> 01:43:42.118]  And from what I am told, it goes from the local governments all the way up to the federal government is in bed with Antifa and is very sympathetic.
[01:43:42.118 --> 01:43:49.765]  And you know, they have been, Antifa has existed in Germany for nearly 100 years, especially in Berlin.
[01:43:49.765 --> 01:43:54.089]  And so they've had a long time to entrench themselves in the system.
[01:43:54.089 --> 01:43:58.793]  And it sounded crazy a few years ago, if you would have said that we would have Antifa sympathetic
[01:43:59.393 --> 01:43:59.773]  All right.
[01:44:18.366 --> 01:44:18.587]  I think?
[01:44:31.227 --> 01:44:32.808]  Continue with your observations.
[01:44:58.436 --> 01:45:10.226]  Sure, you know, I talked to a lot of activists and ranking politicians and journalists, authors this weekend, and you know, they feel so suffocated and so suppressed in Germany.
[01:45:10.226 --> 01:45:16.131]  They get basically no accurate reporting from the mainstream media, especially on these sensitive issues.
[01:45:16.591 --> 01:45:20.073]  And they were so thankful to have foreign media there.
[01:45:20.073 --> 01:45:22.434]  I wasn't the only foreign media member.
[01:45:22.434 --> 01:45:24.815]  The others there were not doing any kind of breaking reporting.
[01:45:24.815 --> 01:45:27.016]  They'll have other reports coming as well.
[01:45:27.016 --> 01:45:33.558]  But we were the first to really get it out on the internet as to what went down this weekend and to get some accurate reporting about what went down.
[01:45:33.558 --> 01:45:35.359]  And they're so appreciative of that.
[01:45:35.359 --> 01:45:39.581]  And they say it's like living in a totally authoritarian state at this point.
[01:45:39.581 --> 01:45:41.802]  And as you see, I'm with a member of the government.
[01:45:42.222 --> 01:45:51.207]  This guy has, he couldn't even be out on the street for five minutes without us having to worry about Antifa showing up with weapons to attack us or en masse.
[01:45:51.207 --> 01:45:53.127]  And this is a ranking member of the government.
[01:45:53.127 --> 01:45:54.528]  And we're starting to see that in the U.S.
[01:45:54.528 --> 01:45:54.768]  as well.
[01:45:54.768 --> 01:45:57.229]  We've seen what's happened to Rand Paul in the streets.
[01:45:57.229 --> 01:46:00.071]  We know what they would do to Trump if he didn't have secret security.
[01:46:00.071 --> 01:46:02.872]  So, I mean, this is happening in the U.S.
[01:46:02.872 --> 01:46:03.212]  as well.
[01:46:03.212 --> 01:46:05.273]  People just need to look at what's going on in Germany.
[01:46:07.848 --> 01:46:09.208]  They try to kill him with Scalise.
[01:46:09.208 --> 01:46:10.609]  They shoot Scalise.
[01:46:10.609 --> 01:46:11.749]  Bodyguards kill him quickly.
[01:46:11.749 --> 01:46:16.631]  The guy said he came to kill the 18 members of their conservative baseball team.
[01:46:16.631 --> 01:46:18.991]  Then they break six ribs, puncture his lungs.
[01:46:18.991 --> 01:46:23.833]  The media says, we hope he dies, even though he's anti-war.
[01:46:23.833 --> 01:46:26.273]  And then they come and try to kill him in DC.
[01:46:26.273 --> 01:46:28.494]  I mean, that's who these people are.
[01:46:30.825 --> 01:46:31.426]  Absolutely.
[01:46:31.426 --> 01:46:35.309]  And if this was the streets of Germany, they probably would have had a much better shot.
[01:46:35.309 --> 01:46:40.873]  So we just need to watch what's going on here and watch how quickly it's devolving in the United States.
[01:46:40.873 --> 01:46:43.596]  I'm amazed at how fast it's happening in the U.S.
[01:46:43.596 --> 01:46:46.998]  and how quickly the streets are devolving into violence.
[01:46:46.998 --> 01:46:53.283]  And you know, the Germans, and I was with some Brits who have their own issues as well, and they say, you know, you're talking about what's going on in Germany.
[01:46:53.283 --> 01:46:55.205]  Why don't you look at what's going on in Portland and Seattle?
[01:46:55.205 --> 01:46:55.826]  I said, you know what?
[01:46:55.826 --> 01:46:56.886]  I can't even talk.
[01:46:56.886 --> 01:46:57.367]  You're right.
[01:46:57.367 --> 01:46:59.328]  I mean, we have a crisis there as well.
[01:47:00.129 --> 01:47:08.752]  You know, people need to get their heads on straight and see what we're up against and vote accordingly on November 3rd.
[01:47:08.752 --> 01:47:12.833]  Yeah, we're not putting Germany down or England down or the U.S.
[01:47:12.833 --> 01:47:13.073]  down.
[01:47:13.073 --> 01:47:15.074]  This isn't about who's got a big problem.
[01:47:15.074 --> 01:47:17.895]  It's about us coming together and defeating this.
[01:47:17.895 --> 01:47:23.917]  And instead of fighting the street-level thing, we need to go after the head of the snake.
[01:47:25.345 --> 01:47:27.729]  Soros is just a general.
[01:47:27.729 --> 01:47:30.935]  Who are the masters from your research, Dan Lyman, that run this?
[01:47:30.935 --> 01:47:33.940]  I mean, we know it's the UN, but above that, major corporations.
[01:47:35.194 --> 01:47:39.418]  Sure, corporations, the UN of course, the EU, Soros.
[01:47:39.418 --> 01:47:45.203]  I mean, some of these people are so deep in the shadows we probably don't even know their names, but we do know how the revenue is trickling in.
[01:47:45.203 --> 01:47:55.112]  And what you just said about taking off the head of the snake, I asked so many different people this weekend during interviews, what do we need to do to mitigate this situation?
[01:47:55.112 --> 01:47:59.916]  And they all said you need to go after the funding streams and you need to cut the heads off of the snake.
[01:48:00.656 --> 01:48:02.877]  Of course, because there's more than one head, of course.
[01:48:02.877 --> 01:48:05.259]  And that's the advice that they all gave.
[01:48:05.259 --> 01:48:09.961]  You know, I spoke to people, political activists, who have been jumped in the street by Antifa.
[01:48:09.961 --> 01:48:12.542]  I talked to a guy who had been stabbed by them.
[01:48:12.542 --> 01:48:14.763]  And, you know, none of them advocated violence.
[01:48:14.763 --> 01:48:17.605]  None of them wanted to see retaliatory violence against them.
[01:48:17.605 --> 01:48:28.130]  They just said, you need to go and cut off their funding streams and suffocate them essentially that way so that they cannot continue to operate the way that they are and remove their political power as well.
[01:48:28.450 --> 01:48:33.855]  But instead it's conservatives and nationalists and Christians that are being cut off and abused.
[01:48:33.855 --> 01:48:36.258]  We need national governments to stop our abuse.
[01:48:36.258 --> 01:48:38.440]  They need to stand up against this racketeering.
[01:48:39.949 --> 01:48:48.553]  Yes, and you know, to see the amount of persecution that members of the AFD there, like I said, they're the populist nationalist party there.
[01:48:48.553 --> 01:48:51.755]  They're about as radical as Trump in most cases.
[01:48:51.755 --> 01:48:57.958]  Many of them told me that as soon as it became known that they were affiliated with that party, many of their family members would stop talking to them.
[01:48:57.958 --> 01:48:59.338]  They would lose friends.
[01:48:59.338 --> 01:49:00.559]  They began getting harassed.
[01:49:00.939 --> 01:49:01.259]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:49:23.587 --> 01:49:27.271]  You know, they have been horribly persecuted even by their own families.
[01:49:27.271 --> 01:49:27.631]  That's right.
[01:49:27.631 --> 01:49:38.061]  If you don't totally haul up a white flag and say, I surrender to whatever big megacorporations want to do with a giant horde of third world people they've already exploited, then you're a Nazi.
[01:49:38.061 --> 01:49:40.984]  And then meanwhile, their leader, George Soros, worked for the Nazis.
[01:49:40.984 --> 01:49:45.989]  I mean, the richness of this, it's beyond hypocrisy.
[01:49:45.989 --> 01:49:47.791]  The paradox is just too bizarre.
[01:49:49.289 --> 01:49:49.869]  Absolutely.
[01:49:49.869 --> 01:49:52.510]  And you know, they're not even allowed to talk about it.
[01:49:52.510 --> 01:49:55.511]  And I'm talking about the experience of the Germans because I was just with them.
[01:49:55.511 --> 01:49:58.612]  I'm also talking about the experience of the Brits because I was just with them.
[01:49:58.612 --> 01:50:01.053]  But Americans can now sympathize with that as well.
[01:50:01.053 --> 01:50:02.973]  You feel like you can't even talk about it.
[01:50:02.973 --> 01:50:07.135]  You can't even pose an opposing view or question.
[01:50:07.135 --> 01:50:10.436]  You have to bow down to a bunch of drug addict devil worshippers.
[01:50:11.502 --> 01:50:12.463]  Yes, absolutely.
[01:50:12.463 --> 01:50:17.646]  And another thing that we were encountering was really the oppressive corona tyranny in Germany.
[01:50:17.646 --> 01:50:19.347]  It's totally crazy there.
[01:50:19.347 --> 01:50:26.952]  They have it broken down now where basically if you were in Berlin and you went home to a different part of the country, you'd have to quarantine for 14 days.
[01:50:26.952 --> 01:50:30.654]  I just snuck in before the quarantine by a few hours.
[01:50:30.654 --> 01:50:33.796]  It's all a cover for martial law, isn't it?
[01:50:33.796 --> 01:50:34.677]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:50:34.677 --> 01:50:35.257]  No question.
[01:50:35.257 --> 01:50:39.660]  Coronavirus is permanent, global, technocracy, administered martial law.
[01:50:40.888 --> 01:50:41.468]  Definitely.
[01:50:41.468 --> 01:50:47.212]  And they're progressively closing down in ways doing the compartmentalized lockdowns.
[01:50:47.212 --> 01:50:50.234]  We've gone from national lockdowns to city lockdowns.
[01:50:50.234 --> 01:50:58.680]  Now we're going down to neighborhood lockdowns in some cases, like in Madrid, where we're being confined to like tiny little areas where we're going to be allowed to move around.
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:51:01.621]  All of this is a giant exercise in admitted oppression.
[01:51:01.621 --> 01:51:05.624]  But from what I'm seeing with millions rallying in Germany, the public sees through this.
[01:51:05.624 --> 01:51:07.105]  They already dealt with tyranny before.
[01:51:07.105 --> 01:51:08.446]  I mean, they're seeing through this, Dan.
[01:51:09.690 --> 01:51:16.692]  The problem is, many of them do, and many of them don't, and they're perfectly happy to enforce these rules on behalf of the state, and it's disturbing.
[01:51:16.692 --> 01:51:17.372]  You're right.
[01:51:17.372 --> 01:51:20.273]  Let's come back in five more minutes ahead of our next guest joining us.
[01:51:20.273 --> 01:51:24.214]  Dan Lyman is on fire.
[01:51:24.214 --> 01:51:25.555]  Think of a new podcast name.
[01:51:25.555 --> 01:51:27.455]  The show's on fire.
[01:51:27.455 --> 01:51:29.276]  Or fire.
[01:51:29.276 --> 01:51:32.097]  EuropeWars.com, at CitizenAnalyst on Twitter.
[01:51:32.097 --> 01:51:33.097]  Dan Lyman.
[01:51:33.097 --> 01:51:35.398]  We're back in T-minus two minutes, stay with us.
[01:51:39.960 --> 01:51:49.105]  The Bible talks about there being ten kings of the earth that sit above the nation states and who give their power unto the one world leader, the Antichrist.
[01:51:49.105 --> 01:51:56.670]  And he has a beast system that no one can buy and or sell unless he has that mark in the forehead or in the palm of their hand.
[01:51:56.670 --> 01:52:03.854]  And we look back on all the warnings that were given and all just the common sense that you don't believe in God.
[01:52:04.554 --> 01:52:04.874]  We're here.
[01:52:34.534 --> 01:52:36.377]  They're just rolling it out.
[01:52:36.377 --> 01:52:37.739]  And a lot of people are complying with it.
[01:52:37.739 --> 01:52:38.359]  It's insane.
[01:52:40.959 --> 01:52:48.284]  InfoWars is a archetypal classic example of free, independent, organic resistance against tyranny.
[01:52:48.284 --> 01:52:49.725]  You built InfoWars.
[01:52:49.725 --> 01:52:51.226]  You spread the word.
[01:52:51.226 --> 01:52:52.447]  You prayed for us.
[01:52:52.447 --> 01:52:53.828]  You bought the products.
[01:52:53.828 --> 01:52:54.968]  You called in.
[01:52:54.968 --> 01:52:56.329]  You made recommendations.
[01:52:56.329 --> 01:52:58.991]  InfoWars is as much yours as it is mine.
[01:52:58.991 --> 01:53:07.177]  And that's why the enemy is so upset that under the deplatforming, under all the DNC lawsuits, under all the attack, in many ways, we've become stronger.
[01:53:07.177 --> 01:53:10.639]  With Band.Video, the redesigned InfoWars, with all of our great crew,
[01:53:11.159 --> 01:53:17.102]  With documentary films and 10 hours of live radio and TV a day.
[01:53:17.102 --> 01:53:18.442]  We are the resistance.
[01:53:18.442 --> 01:53:19.342]  You are the resistance.
[01:53:19.342 --> 01:53:29.427]  So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for you to continue to spread the word about it and to continue for you to support because this is something we built together.
[01:53:29.427 --> 01:53:30.747]  It's not just a national treasure.
[01:53:30.747 --> 01:53:35.189]  It's a treasure worldwide against the tyrants and they know it and they can't stand it.
[01:53:35.189 --> 01:53:38.831]  And as everything we talked about comes true, our credibility only goes up together.
[01:53:38.831 --> 01:53:39.691]  So I salute you all.
[01:53:43.177 --> 01:53:45.782]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:53.041]  Big Brother.
[01:53:53.041 --> 01:53:55.341]  Mainstream media.
[01:53:55.341 --> 01:53:57.202]  Government cover-ups.
[01:53:57.202 --> 01:53:59.242]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:53:59.242 --> 01:54:01.363]  Well, so does he.
[01:54:01.363 --> 01:54:06.805]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:54:06.805 --> 01:54:14.167]  I am so proud of your InfoWars.com and InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and HallSiteSummit.News and VanDockVideo.
[01:54:14.167 --> 01:54:15.728]  Just look at that great HD footage.
[01:54:15.728 --> 01:54:18.348]  That looks better than what the New York Times comes out with.
[01:54:18.348 --> 01:54:19.869]  I mean, that's Dan Lyman
[01:54:21.164 --> 01:54:24.586]  And one crew member, and our listeners financed that and put that in the field.
[01:54:24.586 --> 01:54:27.888]  If you're a radio listener, you can find it all at EuropeWars.com.
[01:54:27.888 --> 01:54:29.969]  Dan, we got about four minutes left in this segment.
[01:54:29.969 --> 01:54:31.910]  I just, I love what you're doing.
[01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:33.871]  We're trying to get a bigger war chest to fund you.
[01:54:33.871 --> 01:54:35.431]  I'm glad you're getting a crew.
[01:54:35.431 --> 01:54:36.832]  You're kicking ass.
[01:54:36.832 --> 01:54:40.774]  What else do you want to say about what's unfolded with the ongoing UN invasion?
[01:54:40.774 --> 01:54:46.057]  As COVID destroys the third world, the UN admits they're going to use the third world to totally swamp the West.
[01:54:46.057 --> 01:54:49.859]  What else do you want to impart to the viewers and listeners on this live October 13th transmission?
[01:54:51.283 --> 01:55:00.250]  Well, as the borders remain open in many regards to the third world migrants, our borders continue to close tighter and tighter.
[01:55:00.250 --> 01:55:04.574]  Europe is essentially going down into another phase of lockdown.
[01:55:04.574 --> 01:55:05.695]  Oh, that's so key.
[01:55:05.695 --> 01:55:09.318]  They're locking us down in our neighborhoods and we can't travel, but the big border is open.
[01:55:09.318 --> 01:55:10.779]  I mean, this is so obvious.
[01:55:10.779 --> 01:55:15.303]  We're being invaded and being told to lock down and be on house arrest while we're invaded.
[01:55:16.522 --> 01:55:16.842]  Right.
[01:55:16.842 --> 01:55:19.223]  And I would say that that's all part of the agenda as well.
[01:55:19.223 --> 01:55:26.705]  I mean, that keeps less people out on the streets, less people talking to each other, gathering together, talking about the latest news in many ways.
[01:55:26.705 --> 01:55:31.187]  And so we're seeing, you know, the UK is descending into crazy corona tyranny.
[01:55:31.187 --> 01:55:34.488]  The Netherlands is going into another partial lockdown.
[01:55:34.488 --> 01:55:38.889]  Switzerland is bringing in new rules that are pretty oppressive, in my opinion.
[01:55:38.889 --> 01:55:41.070]  And it's happening in Germany.
[01:55:41.070 --> 01:55:41.930]  It's happening in France.
[01:55:42.610 --> 01:55:43.951]  It's not going to end, folks.
[01:55:43.951 --> 01:55:46.652]  They have no intention of letting this ever end.
[01:55:46.652 --> 01:55:47.153]  Exactly.
[01:55:47.153 --> 01:55:48.733]  It's a tightening down.
[01:55:48.733 --> 01:55:51.575]  Gates just said 10 years.
[01:55:51.575 --> 01:55:51.875]  Right.
[01:55:51.875 --> 01:55:56.317]  And you know, there are some people out there who say, oh, after November 3rd, it's all going to change.
[01:55:56.317 --> 01:55:58.118]  Maybe in the United States, maybe not.
[01:55:58.118 --> 01:56:03.901]  But if it was just a U.S.-based election, you know, focused agenda, it wouldn't be happening.
[01:56:03.901 --> 01:56:07.323]  No, this is a global technocrat power grab.
[01:56:07.323 --> 01:56:08.844]  This is introducing martial law to us.
[01:56:09.907 --> 01:56:10.427]  Absolutely.
[01:56:10.427 --> 01:56:19.634]  And when I was with you back in July there in studio, we talked about this and I was saying how, you know, it was just at the hint of daylight that they might be easing back on some of these restrictions.
[01:56:19.634 --> 01:56:26.838]  But what I was noticing was, was that they were giving us this false sense of security while they took more away with the other hand.
[01:56:26.838 --> 01:56:28.459]  And that's now we're watching that happen.
[01:56:28.459 --> 01:56:29.720]  Don't worry, it'll go away.
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:30.781]  But no, it never goes away.
[01:56:31.829 --> 01:56:40.133]  Right, and you know, I'm concerned about these comments coming out of the WHO that is giving us a false sense of security, where they say, you know, we're not advocating for lockdowns anymore.
[01:56:40.133 --> 01:56:44.935]  Maybe that's the case, but it's to keep us off balance, where they're going to say, yeah, but you're never going to take your mask off again.
[01:56:44.935 --> 01:56:47.796]  Or you've got to have an app that lets you travel.
[01:56:47.796 --> 01:56:48.276]  That's just me.
[01:56:48.276 --> 01:56:49.257]  Oh, we're not for lockdowns.
[01:56:49.257 --> 01:56:49.837]  Just have your app.
[01:56:50.871 --> 01:56:52.833]  Yes, actually, that's actually interesting news.
[01:56:52.833 --> 01:57:01.862]  The EU reportedly today just agreed, all EU nations, they're agreed on common travel rules pertaining to COVID.
[01:57:01.862 --> 01:57:03.343]  We have that posted over at Europe24.com.
[01:57:03.343 --> 01:57:07.647]  That's a global travel ID that you're talking about making Hitler salivate.
[01:57:07.647 --> 01:57:07.948]  This is...
[01:57:09.440 --> 01:57:15.466]  Right, because until very recently you could still travel to certain European countries and they would let you in.
[01:57:15.466 --> 01:57:16.447]  It wasn't really that big of a deal.
[01:57:16.447 --> 01:57:21.813]  Because notice the EU wants open borders on its contiguous borders, but domestically you don't have travel.
[01:57:21.813 --> 01:57:22.353]  Wow!
[01:57:22.353 --> 01:57:23.895]  That's the opposite of the promise, Dan.
[01:57:25.066 --> 01:57:25.946]  Right, exactly.
[01:57:25.946 --> 01:57:33.810]  And you know, and even if you travel, if I was to come home from Berlin on Monday, this Monday, instead of Sunday, I would have had to quarantine for 10 days in Switzerland.
[01:57:33.810 --> 01:57:43.635]  And those rules are becoming more and more frequent and oppressive, and they're introducing more and more areas, and basically, you know... Well, Gates said, he said it never ends until there's not one COVID case.
[01:57:43.635 --> 01:57:51.318]  Well, any regular coronavirus is a false positive, so until the cold virus is eradicated, he's got to rule us.
[01:57:51.318 --> 01:57:53.139]  This is how big tech takes over.
[01:57:53.139 --> 01:57:54.060]  Everyone must get it.
[01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:59.162]  I've been mad at Trump about going along with this, but I think he's starting to get it.
[01:57:59.162 --> 01:58:00.843]  What do you think, Dan?
[01:58:00.843 --> 01:58:06.766]  I think he is, and I think he tried what you said to get out ahead of this and put out a vaccine that wasn't controlled by Gates.
[01:58:06.766 --> 01:58:11.408]  And now Gates is doubling down and saying, oh, well, we need to wait for the second round of vaccines.
[01:58:11.408 --> 01:58:12.448]  Now he's trying to play chess.
[01:58:12.448 --> 01:58:15.169]  Does that validate what Trump did?
[01:58:15.169 --> 01:58:16.450]  Was to neutralize that?
[01:58:17.392 --> 01:58:23.376]  Definitely, and Trump has now been really pushing Regeneron, saying that it would be more effective, their product, than the vaccines.
[01:58:23.376 --> 01:58:25.117]  So I think Trump was trying to get ahead of this.
[01:58:25.117 --> 01:58:26.818]  We'll see if he can do it again.
[01:58:26.818 --> 01:58:27.458]  It's incredible!
[01:58:27.458 --> 01:58:30.220]  We have a president actually fighting them.
[01:58:30.220 --> 01:58:31.941]  It's amazing.
[01:58:31.941 --> 01:58:32.461]  He's amazing.
[01:58:32.461 --> 01:58:35.022]  Everybody needs to get out there and vote on November 3rd.
[01:58:35.022 --> 01:58:39.045]  Donald Trump, vote like your life depends on it, like the Dems say, because it does.
[01:58:39.045 --> 01:58:39.705]  Dem right.
[01:58:39.705 --> 01:58:41.186]  Alright, Dan Lyman, you're amazing.
[01:58:41.186 --> 01:58:42.347]  Europewars.com.
[01:58:42.347 --> 01:58:43.908]  Europewars.com.
[01:58:43.908 --> 01:58:45.549]  Spread that link like your life depends on it.
[01:58:45.549 --> 01:58:45.909]  Thank you, Dan.
[01:58:49.127 --> 01:59:02.560]  Computer research scientists, engineers working with attorneys have conclusively proven and put out detailed reports at Tablet Magazine documenting what any trained eye could already see as plain as day.
[01:59:02.560 --> 01:59:05.162]  Communist Chinese working in tandem with
[01:59:05.242 --> 01:59:17.685]  The United Nations and the Democratic Party in the United States, as well as the media, put out fake videos and total hysteria to make it look like Day of the Dead, End of the World in China earlier this year.
[01:59:17.685 --> 01:59:24.086]  Then the UN put out standardized rules designed to keep the West locked down when China reopened within three months.
[01:59:24.086 --> 01:59:27.447]  This is the greatest strategic coup ever.
[01:59:27.447 --> 01:59:31.128]  This is 21st century warfare being carried out
[01:59:31.528 --> 01:59:34.732]  Some psychological means are the ultimate sign-off.
[01:59:34.732 --> 01:59:38.137]  Paul Joseph Watson has written about it at InfoWars.com.
[01:59:38.137 --> 01:59:41.381]  Myself, Alex Jones, David Eino and Troy are covering this heavily.
[01:59:41.381 --> 01:59:46.687]  This is the way to bring down the globalists, is exposing how Communist China and the UN were behind the hysteria.
[02:00:16.766 --> 02:00:18.027]  Well, now it's out in the open.
[02:00:18.027 --> 02:00:19.228]  Bill Gates says the U.N.
[02:00:19.228 --> 02:00:21.529]  controls your life with apps on your phone.
[02:00:21.529 --> 02:00:23.490]  The lockdown will never end.
[02:00:23.490 --> 02:00:27.413]  And it's a war against individual families and individual businesses.
[02:00:27.413 --> 02:00:30.395]  It's a corporate fascist slash communist takeover.
[02:00:30.395 --> 02:00:33.017]  Carlos Zapata, a month and a half ago, knocked it out of the park.
[02:00:33.017 --> 02:00:35.378]  He's now a major leader in California.
[02:00:35.378 --> 02:00:37.299]  People call in all the time saying, get him back on the show.
[02:00:37.299 --> 02:00:38.240]  He's back with us.
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:42.202]  But here's what he had to say about, you won't stop us if it comes to blows.
[02:00:42.202 --> 02:00:42.583]  Here it is.
[02:00:43.889 --> 02:00:45.550]  Uh, Sheriff, good to see you.
[02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:48.292]  I'm telling you guys, you know, I'm pretty appalled at what's going on.
[02:00:48.292 --> 02:01:07.965]  You know, at first we sat as concerned citizens that we all want to figure out how to best navigate our way through this whole COVID thing, you know, and, uh, as, as we realized that it's not quite as dangerous as we thought it'd be, you know, I was absolutely appalled at the cowardice, you know, and as you're sitting there with their masks on, uh, I don't blame you for wearing masks because I'd be hiding my face too if I was you for what you're doing.
[02:01:07.965 --> 02:01:09.606]  It's absolutely horrendous what you're doing to these people.
[02:01:09.606 --> 02:01:13.409]  I'm a business owner and, uh, I'm telling you, our families are starving.
[02:01:13.789 --> 02:01:20.610]  You know, you guys can sit here with your jobs, you can sit here and you're going to get paid, you can fall asleep in your chair like that gentleman's doing behind his mask right there, okay?
[02:01:20.610 --> 02:01:23.911]  And I'm telling you right now, that right now we're being peaceful.
[02:01:23.911 --> 02:01:27.332]  And you better be happy that we're good citizens, that we're peaceful citizens.
[02:01:27.332 --> 02:01:29.712]  But it's not going to be peaceful much longer, okay?
[02:01:29.712 --> 02:01:32.273]  And this isn't a threat, I'm not a criminal, I've never been a criminal.
[02:01:32.273 --> 02:01:37.834]  I'm telling you, good citizens are going to turn into real concerned and revolutionary citizens real soon.
[02:01:37.834 --> 02:01:39.374]  And nobody else is going to say that.
[02:01:39.374 --> 02:01:41.975]  I'm probably the only person that has the balls to say what I'm saying right now.
[02:01:42.995 --> 02:01:48.098]  That we're building, we're organizing, and we'll work with law enforcement or without law enforcement.
[02:01:48.098 --> 02:01:52.761]  But you won't stop us when time comes because our families are starving.
[02:01:52.761 --> 02:01:57.163]  And if you don't hear the seriousness of my voice, I hope you open your ears and you absolutely listen to what I'm saying.
[02:01:57.163 --> 02:02:00.245]  Because this is a warning for what's coming.
[02:02:00.245 --> 02:02:01.666]  It's not going to be peaceful much longer.
[02:02:01.666 --> 02:02:07.529]  It's not going to be rah-rah, it's not going to be speeches, it's not going to be gathering outside saying the Pledge of Allegiance, it's not going to be waving flags.
[02:02:07.529 --> 02:02:08.130]  It's going to be real.
[02:02:09.599 --> 02:02:12.680]  When you see the things that I've seen, I went to war for this country.
[02:02:12.680 --> 02:02:16.181]  I've seen the ugliest, dirtiest part of humanity.
[02:02:16.181 --> 02:02:17.521]  I've been in combat.
[02:02:17.521 --> 02:02:19.122]  And I never want to go back again.
[02:02:19.122 --> 02:02:21.782]  But I'm telling you what, I will to save this country.
[02:02:21.782 --> 02:02:24.743]  If it has to be against our own citizens, it will happen.
[02:02:24.743 --> 02:02:26.463]  And there's a million people like me.
[02:02:26.463 --> 02:02:28.464]  And you won't stop us.
[02:02:28.464 --> 02:02:30.004]  Open the county.
[02:02:30.004 --> 02:02:32.845]  Let our citizens do what they need to do.
[02:02:32.845 --> 02:02:35.646]  Let owners of businesses do what they need to do to feed their families.
[02:02:36.766 --> 02:02:38.407]  Take the masks off!
[02:02:38.407 --> 02:02:40.748]  Quit masking and muscling your children!
[02:02:40.748 --> 02:02:43.469]  The psychological damage you're doing to them is horrible.
[02:02:43.469 --> 02:02:46.431]  I've had six friends kill themselves since it's happened.
[02:02:46.431 --> 02:02:48.172]  Veterans who lost their jobs.
[02:02:48.172 --> 02:02:50.733]  How do you feel about being complicit in perpetuating that?
[02:02:50.733 --> 02:02:54.695]  The greatest folks ever perpetuated on the American people, and you're a part of it by wearing your masks.
[02:02:54.695 --> 02:02:58.317]  In Shasta County, we're supposed to be red country up here.
[02:02:58.317 --> 02:03:01.278]  Not blue country, we're red country up here.
[02:03:01.278 --> 02:03:02.459]  The oldest form of war
[02:03:03.968 --> 02:03:14.232]  The oldest form of total war is siege, shutting down people's right to movement and their right to be able to feed themselves and be able to get water.
[02:03:14.232 --> 02:03:23.555]  And now Bill Gates says it never ends, it's a great leap forward, they're cutting off the carbon, they're depopulating us, they're telling us that they're killing us.
[02:03:24.571 --> 02:03:34.608]  And so none of us want physical confrontation, but you shut us off, you starve us, you bankrupt us, you tell us you're coming with dangerous vaccines to put them in our body, you're coming to assault us!
[02:03:36.673 --> 02:03:45.819]  And so I've always been a peaceful guy, and the enemy's got it all set up with a provocateur, some antifa in Michigan, trying to kidnap the governor to make that tyrant a victim.
[02:03:45.819 --> 02:03:48.501]  We don't want any offensive stuff right now.
[02:03:48.501 --> 02:03:55.466]  But we have to start having the discussion about, we're under assault, we're being economically bankrupted as a tool of control.
[02:03:56.465 --> 02:04:00.567]  We have to start having a real debate about who's in command and control of this.
[02:04:00.567 --> 02:04:01.687]  Who is the enemy?
[02:04:01.687 --> 02:04:11.951]  Because the identification in a war is part of the war that once the public figures out that they're under attack, a lot of times the enemy stops attacking once we organize the response.
[02:04:11.951 --> 02:04:13.832]  But we are now in that wheelhouse.
[02:04:13.832 --> 02:04:15.753]  Carlos Zapata is a really smart guy.
[02:04:17.076 --> 02:04:30.541]  Former Marine, husband, father of four, Iraq veteran, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt and teacher, resident of Palo Credo, California, and patriot owner of a successful business there in town.
[02:04:30.541 --> 02:04:37.144]  He joins us at Carlos underscore Zapata underscore one on Instagram, Carlos dot Zapata dot nine zero.
[02:04:37.144 --> 02:04:38.825]  I can ask a lot of questions, brother.
[02:04:38.825 --> 02:04:39.825]  We're all on the same page.
[02:04:39.825 --> 02:04:41.246]  We're all in the same position here.
[02:04:41.246 --> 02:04:42.446]  We know we're under attack.
[02:04:42.446 --> 02:04:45.707]  Since you were on a month ago with us, where do you want to go first?
[02:04:45.707 --> 02:04:46.628]  And I've got my questions.
[02:04:48.717 --> 02:04:49.558]  Well, a lot's happened.
[02:04:49.558 --> 02:04:50.740]  Thanks for having me again, Alex.
[02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:52.402]  I appreciate you having me on your show again.
[02:04:52.402 --> 02:05:01.794]  And a lot's happened since we last talked, and I figured it'd be a good time to come back on and update you as to what we've been doing and what's transpired over the last four or five weeks.
[02:05:01.794 --> 02:05:04.057]  So, wherever you want to start, we can take it from there.
[02:05:04.755 --> 02:05:07.037]  Well, I mean, I can ask a lot of questions, but you're on the ground.
[02:05:07.037 --> 02:05:09.138]  Obviously, people resonated with what you said.
[02:05:09.138 --> 02:05:13.321]  I resonated, because I'm not looking for physical stuff, but I'm under physical attack.
[02:05:13.321 --> 02:05:15.643]  Economic warfare is true war.
[02:05:15.643 --> 02:05:17.004]  We are being attacked.
[02:05:17.004 --> 02:05:20.687]  We don't want to be tricked into a physical response, but we have to start having that discussion.
[02:05:20.687 --> 02:05:21.768]  Where do you want to go first?
[02:05:23.095 --> 02:05:23.475]  Absolutely.
[02:05:23.475 --> 02:05:32.559]  So Alex, you said something a couple seconds ago here about them taking away our ability to travel and taking away our ability to feed ourselves.
[02:05:32.559 --> 02:05:41.283]  You know, so the week after we talked, I was on a flight out of Sacramento, California, headed to Florida, and we were on a tarmac.
[02:05:41.283 --> 02:05:45.364]  And my wife and I were both asked to leave the flight because we refused to put masks on.
[02:05:45.364 --> 02:05:46.505]  So that was step one.
[02:05:46.505 --> 02:05:48.225]  That was the first time.
[02:05:48.225 --> 02:05:50.986]  Next it'll be you don't have a vaccine certificate.
[02:05:50.986 --> 02:05:51.787]  That's the whole plan.
[02:05:54.291 --> 02:05:54.752]  Absolutely.
[02:05:54.752 --> 02:05:55.533]  So we did that.
[02:05:55.533 --> 02:05:57.516]  We got off the flight to kick this off right there on tarmac.
[02:05:58.123 --> 02:06:01.406]  You know, and we got our bags and we're back home.
[02:06:01.406 --> 02:06:09.773]  Now, fast forward a few weeks to that, we were invited by Dr. Cordy Williams to be a part of the 1776 Weber Freedom Tour.
[02:06:09.773 --> 02:06:12.295]  And so, we ended up flying out to St.
[02:06:12.295 --> 02:06:13.596]  Louis, Missouri.
[02:06:13.596 --> 02:06:14.977]  On the way there, we had no problem.
[02:06:14.977 --> 02:06:19.601]  You know, we sort of had our neck gaiters on, we pulled them down as soon as we got on the plane, nobody said anything.
[02:06:19.601 --> 02:06:22.704]  On the way back, we decided to get a little bit more aggressive about their enforcement.
[02:06:23.624 --> 02:06:27.868]  And they ended up putting us on a no-fly list from American Airlines.
[02:06:27.868 --> 02:06:43.761]  So that was our little history there, but it doesn't seem like much, but to me that was a huge deal because anytime they can stop people from moving, from being mobile, that is a huge, huge... Oh, that's the first thing the Soviets or the Nazis did.
[02:06:43.761 --> 02:06:48.785]  When they create a list that you can't travel, you're under martial law.
[02:06:48.785 --> 02:06:49.686]  Yes, sir.
[02:06:49.686 --> 02:06:50.326]  Absolutely.
[02:06:50.326 --> 02:06:50.987]  You know?
[02:06:50.987 --> 02:06:52.308]  And then, you know,
[02:06:53.438 --> 02:07:04.385]  I gotta be honest with you, you know, there's been a point over the last few weeks where I was actually disappointed in the president that I very much support when he pulled out his mask during the debates as we all saw.
[02:07:04.385 --> 02:07:08.968]  And I was like, oh man, you know, not you too, but I think we've turned a corner with that.
[02:07:08.968 --> 02:07:11.310]  I think he's shown, you know, and he's been very tactful.
[02:07:11.690 --> 02:07:14.012]  And now he's attacking Fauci saying his pitching is even better than his COVID predictions, yeah.
[02:07:31.873 --> 02:07:36.436]  Absolutely, you know, and we're seeing these numbers come out and all the numbers come outside with us, right?
[02:07:36.436 --> 02:07:37.897]  It's what we've been saying from day one.
[02:07:37.897 --> 02:07:51.708]  It's not nearly as dangerous as we once thought it was, and now they're really starting to hone in on the impact, the psychological impact this is having on our society, the economic impact it's having on our country on a global scale now.
[02:07:52.448 --> 02:07:56.251]  And, uh, which is far worse, far worse than anything that this virus could have ever done.
[02:07:56.251 --> 02:08:00.094]  Even the UN admits millions are starving to death because of the lockdown.
[02:08:00.094 --> 02:08:02.596]  So all these so-called heroes are actually killing.
[02:08:02.596 --> 02:08:06.979]  Because when we, again, as I said, when we collapse, we just go bankrupt.
[02:08:06.979 --> 02:08:07.800]  The third world dies.
[02:08:10.623 --> 02:08:11.424]  Absolutely.
[02:08:11.424 --> 02:08:11.844]  Absolutely.
[02:08:11.844 --> 02:08:13.665]  And this is seven months later, Alex.
[02:08:13.665 --> 02:08:15.306]  This is two weeks in.
[02:08:15.306 --> 02:08:17.227]  You know, we've flattened this curve.
[02:08:17.227 --> 02:08:18.628]  We've moved on from this.
[02:08:18.628 --> 02:08:26.433]  And up here in Northern California, I'm extremely proud of the business owners up here because this round, we're sitting down, so I live in Shaft County.
[02:08:26.433 --> 02:08:29.455]  I own a business in the southern county, Tehama County, just south of us.
[02:08:30.095 --> 02:08:43.422]  And we just recently, over the last couple of days, went into purple, which I don't even know at this point what's purple, red, green, blue, whatever this crazy governor of ours has come up with, this crazy code.
[02:08:43.422 --> 02:08:53.568]  I can't even follow it anymore, you know, but supposedly we went back into the purple zone, which means that we are closed for dining at the restaurants, but I'm very proud of the citizens of Red Bluff and Tehama County.
[02:08:54.028 --> 02:08:56.291]  Because they are staying open and they're now fighting with me.
[02:08:56.291 --> 02:08:57.152]  Now I'm not the only one.
[02:08:57.152 --> 02:08:58.513]  And this is the essence, I love it.
[02:08:58.513 --> 02:09:04.640]  This is the essence of victory is ignoring that psychotic demon Newsome who kept his restaurants open.
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:05.421]  Everybody else couldn't.
[02:09:05.421 --> 02:09:08.164]  That son of a bitch is a... I mean, exactly.
[02:09:08.164 --> 02:09:08.825]  I love to hear it.
[02:09:08.825 --> 02:09:10.366]  People are saying screw you.
[02:09:10.366 --> 02:09:10.767]  That's good.
[02:09:12.430 --> 02:09:15.172]  He's losing control real quick, Alex.
[02:09:15.172 --> 02:09:23.118]  I'm telling you what, I mean, if you would have told me that California was going to turn a corner seven months ago, I would have said, no way, you're crazy, but we're seeing it turn.
[02:09:23.118 --> 02:09:26.180]  And I wouldn't be surprised if we even see California turn purple or even red in the future.
[02:09:26.180 --> 02:09:27.641]  All right, stay there.
[02:09:27.641 --> 02:09:29.322]  No, I know there's a huge awakening.
[02:09:29.322 --> 02:09:31.223]  All right, Carlos Zapata is our guest.
[02:09:31.223 --> 02:09:37.007]  And let's talk about fixing this peacefully, but where this goes with Gates with the forced inoculations.
[02:09:37.007 --> 02:09:37.788]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:09:38.368 --> 02:09:40.815]  They're gonna come to our house and grab our kids.
[02:09:40.815 --> 02:09:43.342]  My kid has a convulsion, you're dead.
[02:09:43.342 --> 02:09:43.963]  We'll be right back.
[02:09:43.963 --> 02:09:44.304]  Stay with us.
[02:09:46.463 --> 02:09:49.385]  2020ElectionsCenter.com.
[02:09:49.385 --> 02:09:52.087]  Just type it in one time, and you've got it saved right there in your browser.
[02:09:52.087 --> 02:10:06.376]  And then you can share it on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Apple platforms, but most importantly, via text message, email, or by word of mouth, because they have banned the links to banned.video.
[02:10:06.376 --> 02:10:14.902]  But 2020ElectionsCenter.com is a clone of the site, the exact same links, the exact same videos, where you can comment, you can share them, everything.
[02:10:14.902 --> 02:10:15.442]  The system
[02:10:16.403 --> 02:10:21.146]  He's censoring because of the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[02:10:21.146 --> 02:10:27.470]  Trump has finally figured this out and says he's going to take action once re-elected against big tech and that he's modern the situation.
[02:10:27.470 --> 02:10:31.932]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry because he has to take an action.
[02:10:31.932 --> 02:10:42.779]  We the people are taking action now and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionCenter.com, 2020ElectionCenter.com and checking out the new, redesigned InfoWars.com and sharing that link.
[02:10:42.779 --> 02:10:44.079]  Oh, that really upsets him.
[02:10:44.079 --> 02:10:44.620]  Oh, yeah.
[02:10:56.755 --> 02:11:01.058]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.Video on your iPhone.
[02:11:01.058 --> 02:11:04.541]  Simply go to Band.Video with your Safari browser.
[02:11:04.541 --> 02:11:07.823]  Then you click the Share button at the bottom of the screen.
[02:11:07.823 --> 02:11:11.366]  When the menu comes up, you simply click Add to Home Screen.
[02:11:11.366 --> 02:11:13.628]  It will then ask you to name the app.
[02:11:13.628 --> 02:11:15.009]  I suggest Band.Video.
[02:11:15.689 --> 02:11:21.152]  You will now have BAN.VIDEO app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[02:11:21.152 --> 02:11:29.637]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[02:11:29.637 --> 02:11:36.341]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[02:11:36.341 --> 02:11:39.163]  However you want, be sure and share BAN.VIDEO.
[02:11:48.767 --> 02:12:03.353]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:12:03.353 --> 02:12:09.315]  You know, a lot of times, Alex Jones here back live, the only way I have to describe my feelings is to describe them.
[02:12:09.315 --> 02:12:10.516]  Because I can't even understand them.
[02:12:13.118 --> 02:12:24.905]  I almost feel weak and pathetic being on air right now talking about this instead of going to Nancy Pelosi's house or going to Barack Obama's house or going to George Soros' house.
[02:12:24.905 --> 02:12:28.408]  Not even to be violent, but just to say, take your foot off my neck.
[02:12:28.408 --> 02:12:32.630]  They admit you want to shut down the economy, you want to bankrupt me to teach me how to behave.
[02:12:32.630 --> 02:12:34.351]  Bill Gates says, oh, this is great.
[02:12:34.351 --> 02:12:38.534]  It's going to make us all lower our carbon footprint when the whole planet's carbon-based.
[02:12:39.653 --> 02:12:49.178]  These are just a bunch of control freaks that revel in consolidation of power, and now they've launched their big move to counter nationalism and populism worldwide.
[02:12:49.178 --> 02:12:51.019]  It's an incredible gamble.
[02:12:51.019 --> 02:12:54.041]  It's causing a major backlash.
[02:12:54.041 --> 02:12:58.003]  Carlos Zapata is a Marine Corps veteran, a patriot, a very well-spoken person.
[02:12:58.003 --> 02:13:02.706]  If I could tell you, he's become incredibly popular all over the country with a statement he made over a month ago.
[02:13:02.706 --> 02:13:05.848]  He's here with us now, but you brought up some good news.
[02:13:06.994 --> 02:13:10.276]  I live in the People's Republic of Austin, which is not Texas.
[02:13:10.276 --> 02:13:14.158]  People ask why, because my family's been here since, you know, the state got founded.
[02:13:14.158 --> 02:13:16.399]  But outside of it, people ignore it.
[02:13:16.399 --> 02:13:19.401]  You go to small towns, mid-sized cities, everybody's ignoring it.
[02:13:19.401 --> 02:13:20.201]  They're laughing at it.
[02:13:20.201 --> 02:13:22.663]  They know it's an exaggeration, overblown hoax.
[02:13:22.663 --> 02:13:30.887]  But you're saying where you're at in Northern California, folks are also finally not complying, because compliance with tyranny is slavery.
[02:13:30.887 --> 02:13:32.348]  Resistance to tyranny is victory.
[02:13:34.350 --> 02:13:37.371]  Absolutely, you know, and this is the Wild West out here, you know.
[02:13:37.371 --> 02:13:42.954]  I mean, we're a big country, but out here in the West, we still have that fight pioneer spirit, and there's people who are just fed up right now.
[02:13:42.954 --> 02:13:45.415]  You know, we've got enough.
[02:13:45.415 --> 02:13:54.399]  The first couple weeks, even the first couple months, everybody tried to comply to do what they felt was right at the time, you know, just to see what was going on and see where this whole thing landed.
[02:13:54.399 --> 02:13:58.020]  Now that we've seen where it landed, people know it's a con now.
[02:13:58.020 --> 02:14:01.682]  They've complied, they gave stuff up to be good, but now they know it's a screw job.
[02:14:02.561 --> 02:14:03.402]  Absolutely.
[02:14:03.402 --> 02:14:07.866]  They know it's a hoax, you know, and they're not only offended and affronted, but they're ready to act.
[02:14:07.866 --> 02:14:09.187]  And now they want revenge.
[02:14:09.187 --> 02:14:10.088]  We want our time back, right?
[02:14:10.088 --> 02:14:14.412]  It's like the guy who's in prison for 20 years and then gets out.
[02:14:14.412 --> 02:14:16.594]  I'm going to want some revenge, right?
[02:14:16.594 --> 02:14:20.437]  I'm the one that wants some compensation.
[02:14:20.437 --> 02:14:20.998]  Retribution.
[02:14:20.998 --> 02:14:21.799]  I want my time back.
[02:14:22.671 --> 02:14:24.131]  Retribution is the right word.
[02:14:24.131 --> 02:14:26.932]  So people are sick of it, Alex.
[02:14:26.932 --> 02:14:28.052]  They're going back to work.
[02:14:28.052 --> 02:14:29.472]  They're taking off their masks.
[02:14:29.472 --> 02:14:30.852]  They're taking the masks off their kids.
[02:14:30.852 --> 02:14:35.093]  They're fighting the school boards to get these kids back in school, because that's the most important thing right now.
[02:14:35.093 --> 02:14:36.513]  It's our education.
[02:14:36.513 --> 02:14:38.914]  And they want to get back to normal right now.
[02:14:38.914 --> 02:14:42.034]  Not 10 days from now, not a month from now.
[02:14:42.034 --> 02:14:45.135]  Right now, people are ready to get back, and they're fighting.
[02:14:45.135 --> 02:14:50.656]  The problem is, Alex, is that the governor has given way too much power to these public health officers in the counties.
[02:14:51.602 --> 02:14:56.783]  And we have a tyrant of a public health officer here in Chesapeake County who is absolutely horrible.
[02:14:56.783 --> 02:15:06.666]  Her name is Karen Ramstrom and I hope people hear her name and keep putting the pressure on her because she has chosen to mandate vaccines now for all hospital workers.
[02:15:06.666 --> 02:15:13.168]  And my wife works at the hospital, gets a flu vaccine every single year, but this year she's not simply because she's now being mandated to.
[02:15:13.168 --> 02:15:18.209]  And that's how this starts is, how this starts is, oh it's the healthcare workers and it's everybody else.
[02:15:19.736 --> 02:15:25.779]  Absolutely, but the small victory we had was that we put enough pressure on her a few weeks ago here, where she actually reversed that decision.
[02:15:25.779 --> 02:15:34.062]  So that was a small victory, but I'm not resting on our laurels by any means, because that can be changed really, really quickly.
[02:15:34.062 --> 02:15:35.163]  And this is what they do, right?
[02:15:35.163 --> 02:15:41.325]  They give you a little bit of what you want, and then they take it away, give you a little bit of what you want, and they take it away, and they keep you on this leash, and they keep you passive.
[02:15:41.325 --> 02:15:47.988]  And again, whether you live in Australia or Germany or the United States, it's the same program, because it's a UN global program.
[02:15:48.368 --> 02:15:51.812]  Pulling back from what's happening locally, big picture here.
[02:15:51.812 --> 02:15:57.279]  This is admittedly about world government, collapse of civilization, a consolidation of control.
[02:15:57.279 --> 02:16:03.366]  I mean people have to recognize how dystopic this is to understand the only thing you have to lose is compliance.
[02:16:03.366 --> 02:16:06.850]  You comply, we're done.
[02:16:06.850 --> 02:16:07.331]  Absolutely.
[02:16:07.992 --> 02:16:09.633]  This has been my message from day one, Alex.
[02:16:09.633 --> 02:16:11.515]  People say, oh, it's just a mask, you know.
[02:16:11.515 --> 02:16:13.376]  It's just, you know, I'm not confrontational.
[02:16:13.376 --> 02:16:16.179]  I want to be able to go to the store efficiently without being confronted.
[02:16:16.179 --> 02:16:17.460]  I said, well, you're the problem.
[02:16:17.460 --> 02:16:25.506]  You know, you are the problem because these masks make it very, very easy for them to count and to see who they can and cannot control, you know.
[02:16:25.506 --> 02:16:26.647]  And that is step one.
[02:16:26.647 --> 02:16:27.328]  Now we're seeing
[02:16:27.728 --> 02:16:30.330]  You know, all the illnesses and everything else that comes along with wearing a mask.
[02:16:30.330 --> 02:16:32.152]  And we talked about this last time.
[02:16:32.152 --> 02:16:35.775]  I won't beat that dead horse, but I think we know where we're at with these masks and how horrible it is.
[02:16:35.775 --> 02:16:36.515]  No, no, tell folks.
[02:16:36.515 --> 02:16:43.141]  All the people know about the bacteria and the rotting teeth and the fact that we're supposed to excrete this stuff and not keep it in our body.
[02:16:43.141 --> 02:16:46.684]  Because there's a lot of what we're... We're not just taking a piss or a crap.
[02:16:46.684 --> 02:16:50.087]  What you're coming out of your mouth is a form of getting rid of stuff.
[02:16:53.180 --> 02:16:59.325]  And you see people pulling their mask down to sneeze, or we saw that video of Joe Biden a couple days ago, pulling his mask down to cough, you know?
[02:16:59.325 --> 02:17:04.570]  Well, shit, you might as well, you know, take dog crap, you know, and put it all over your face, because that's about the same.
[02:17:05.327 --> 02:17:05.787]  That's right.
[02:17:37.128 --> 02:17:37.868]  That's exactly what it is.
[02:17:37.868 --> 02:17:39.749]  It's absolutely disgusting, you know?
[02:17:39.749 --> 02:17:47.711]  And I was pretty happy when I went out to Missouri a few weeks ago for that rally, the 1776 rally.
[02:17:47.711 --> 02:17:48.452]  In the city of St.
[02:17:48.452 --> 02:17:50.252]  Louis, it's absolute chaos, right?
[02:17:50.252 --> 02:17:53.233]  I mean, you can't take three steps without putting a mask on.
[02:17:53.233 --> 02:17:58.455]  But if you go outside into the counties, into the more rural areas, it very much felt like normal life.
[02:17:59.235 --> 02:18:04.598]  And the rally we were at, I did not see one mask at the rally we were at, and there was thousands and thousands of people there.
[02:18:04.598 --> 02:18:05.819]  So people are starting to get it, Alex.
[02:18:05.819 --> 02:18:09.241]  I think people are starting to realize that that mask isn't doing them any good.
[02:18:09.241 --> 02:18:14.824]  And it's also a sign of control and a beginning to this whole playbook that they're running.
[02:18:14.824 --> 02:18:18.466]  Carlos, I totally agree, but the time we have left, I want to get into the big picture.
[02:18:18.466 --> 02:18:24.869]  The globalists, the UN, the lockdown, if Trump gets reelected, if he doesn't, Gates admitting it's a permanent lockdown.
[02:18:24.869 --> 02:18:25.870]  Let's talk big picture.
[02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:28.672]  Why do you think the globalists launched this now?
[02:18:28.672 --> 02:18:29.492]  Where do you think it's going?
[02:18:29.492 --> 02:18:32.815]  How do we counter it?
[02:18:32.815 --> 02:18:34.256]  Well, you said it.
[02:18:34.256 --> 02:18:38.139]  I think where we're headed is mandated vaccines worldwide.
[02:18:38.139 --> 02:18:39.800]  I think it's population control.
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:44.303]  I think it's the absolute socialist agenda.
[02:18:44.303 --> 02:18:52.690]  When we saw this happen in Venezuela, right, Venezuela said, oh, you know, what happened in Cuba will never happen here because we're way more advanced, we're way more careful in how we're rolling out
[02:18:53.070 --> 02:18:58.772]  You know, our socialist agenda, you know, what happened in Cuba will never happen here, and then it happened, it happened worse.
[02:18:58.772 --> 02:19:08.415]  And we're saying the same thing, oh, that socialist agenda will never get rolled out here the way it did in other countries because we're Americans, we're different, we have a sense of freedom, but we're seeing it happen right now.
[02:19:08.415 --> 02:19:19.359]  And the whole idea of this globalist agenda to me, Alex, has always been to bring America to its knees, to make America like every other country, and to absolutely eradicate any sense of American exceptionalism.
[02:19:19.939 --> 02:19:21.140]  And I still believe we're exceptional.
[02:19:21.140 --> 02:19:23.341]  I still think that we are the best country in the world.
[02:19:23.341 --> 02:19:25.702]  I'm prouder than anybody to be an American.
[02:19:25.702 --> 02:19:33.907]  I agree with you though, but the way we've become compliant, we can fall harder than Cuba or Venezuela.
[02:19:33.907 --> 02:19:34.808]  Oh, we absolutely can.
[02:19:34.808 --> 02:19:36.188]  I mean, Rome fell, right?
[02:19:36.188 --> 02:19:40.151]  I mean, not to, you know... No, it's true, but you can smell it.
[02:19:40.151 --> 02:19:43.793]  I mean, if we don't embrace Trump and embrace a rebirth, we're done.
[02:19:47.218 --> 02:19:58.926]  We have exactly three weeks from today, Alex, to make the biggest difference that we can ever make in our country and to determine the course for the rest of our future, really, for the rest of our time here on this earth.
[02:19:58.926 --> 02:20:02.169]  In three weeks, we get to vote.
[02:20:02.169 --> 02:20:04.030]  We have to vote for Trump.
[02:20:04.030 --> 02:20:05.391]  I don't care how you feel about this person.
[02:20:05.391 --> 02:20:07.792]  I don't care if you don't agree with him on some things.
[02:20:07.792 --> 02:20:13.156]  We have a very, very simple and real choice to make here between freedom and slavery.
[02:20:13.156 --> 02:20:14.257]  And I'm going to put it that simply.
[02:20:15.359 --> 02:20:16.960]  That's an incredibly clear choice.
[02:20:16.960 --> 02:20:19.002]  Carlos Zapata is our guest.
[02:20:19.002 --> 02:20:19.742]  He's kicking butt.
[02:20:19.742 --> 02:20:23.165]  You find him at Carlos underscore Zapata underscore one on Twitter.
[02:20:23.165 --> 02:20:25.026]  Carlos dot Zapata dot 90.
[02:20:25.026 --> 02:20:26.987]  Give a great speech to that group of people.
[02:20:26.987 --> 02:20:29.509]  Let's talk about the people.
[02:20:29.509 --> 02:20:30.149]  We the people.
[02:20:30.149 --> 02:20:34.953]  Declaration of Independence talks about who have the power and if there is a war, you can't stop us.
[02:20:34.953 --> 02:20:36.794]  I never talk about stuff like this on air.
[02:20:36.794 --> 02:20:38.655]  I don't want to talk tough.
[02:20:38.655 --> 02:20:40.937]  I'm not a guy that wants to get physical because I know what that means.
[02:20:40.937 --> 02:20:43.659]  But let's talk about bad scenarios when we come back.

[02:21:32.660 --> 02:21:34.021]  Infowarstore.com.
[02:21:34.181 --> 02:21:34.502]  Worldwide!
[02:21:34.502 --> 02:21:36.105]  You are the resistance, the resistance, the resistance!
[02:21:44.710 --> 02:21:51.234]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much less in the entire world.
[02:21:51.234 --> 02:21:57.258]  InfoWars is standalone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks at hundreds of stations picking us up.
[02:21:57.258 --> 02:22:07.705]  Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense, and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda.
[02:22:08.485 --> 02:22:12.727]  That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at Band.Video.
[02:22:12.727 --> 02:22:17.190]  They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook.
[02:22:17.190 --> 02:22:25.594]  That's why it's so precious, because the censorship expands to everyone, which it is now, with AI monitoring and controlling what you can say and do.
[02:22:25.594 --> 02:22:32.498]  It's going to be the OACs like Band.Video and the now redesigned InfoWars.com that become more and more important, which they are.
[02:22:32.938 --> 02:22:40.943]  And the enemy is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now.
[02:22:40.943 --> 02:22:42.404]  They're coming after everyone.
[02:22:42.404 --> 02:22:43.345]  So spread the word now.
[02:22:44.455 --> 02:22:47.637]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[02:22:47.637 --> 02:22:56.182]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence, is going to be your most valuable asset.
[02:22:56.182 --> 02:22:59.784]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[02:22:59.784 --> 02:23:12.491]  The world being built by the technocrats and the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total
[02:23:13.671 --> 02:23:16.233]  Incomplete dehumanization.
[02:23:16.233 --> 02:23:22.518]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[02:23:22.518 --> 02:23:26.201]  This is their stated goal.
[02:23:26.201 --> 02:23:34.468]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[02:23:34.468 --> 02:23:35.769]  Let me turn this around.
[02:23:36.469 --> 02:23:41.872]  You must study their own writings, you must face the facts, and you must come to grips with it.
[02:23:41.872 --> 02:23:46.434]  You're all being incrementally destroyed.
[02:23:46.434 --> 02:23:49.096]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:49.096 --> 02:23:50.816]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:23:50.816 --> 02:23:55.199]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:07.185 --> 02:24:13.975]  Alright, Carl Sopata, a veteran patriot, a business owner, father out in California, is joining us.
[02:24:13.975 --> 02:24:17.180]  And I just want to explain to listeners, I know you know this, but...
[02:24:18.206 --> 02:24:20.108]  We're not in the places we were before.
[02:24:20.108 --> 02:24:32.178]  This is a communist takeover funded by mega banks that always fund communists to consolidate and take over countries and get rid of the middle class and get rid of justice and get rid of due process.
[02:24:32.178 --> 02:24:34.239]  So communism is a tool of the mega rich.
[02:24:34.239 --> 02:24:40.224]  It's why all the big billionaires other than Trump are funding Black Lives Matter and Antifa and the collapse of society.
[02:24:41.129 --> 02:24:43.331]  And so I want Trump to fix things peacefully.
[02:24:43.331 --> 02:24:45.292]  I want America to wake up.
[02:24:45.292 --> 02:24:51.996]  But because the left never gets pushed back on, they never get punished, even if Trump gets in, it's a speed hump to what's coming.
[02:24:51.996 --> 02:25:04.245]  So I don't think listeners understand, I know most of you do, but some may not, that under a Marxist-Bolshevik takeover, this is a Maoist version of their own admissions,
[02:25:05.953 --> 02:25:07.574]  They're coming for you.
[02:25:07.574 --> 02:25:08.834]  The party's over.
[02:25:08.834 --> 02:25:10.755]  They don't care if everything collapses.
[02:25:10.755 --> 02:25:12.335]  They don't care if the city's collapsed.
[02:25:12.335 --> 02:25:15.257]  They don't care if the restaurants are closed.
[02:25:15.257 --> 02:25:16.117]  It's a takeover.
[02:25:16.117 --> 02:25:17.017]  It's war.
[02:25:17.017 --> 02:25:18.758]  They like that.
[02:25:18.758 --> 02:25:19.838]  And that's where we are.
[02:25:19.838 --> 02:25:30.923]  So, Carlos, your experience, I know, with family growing up in Latin America and what happened there, and we've talked about it on air before, people need to realize this isn't like the common cold, like COVID.
[02:25:30.923 --> 02:25:32.803]  This is the plague.
[02:25:32.803 --> 02:25:33.484]  This is death.
[02:25:34.584 --> 02:25:40.749]  What can you speak to historically about that and what people should get ready for if we're not able to fix things peacefully?
[02:25:40.749 --> 02:25:43.171]  Which is me encouraging folks to fix things peacefully.
[02:25:43.171 --> 02:25:50.016]  I think people need to understand then total resistance comes next because it's better to die on your feet than die on your knees.
[02:25:56.758 --> 02:26:00.761]  Nobody wants to make a call for violence earlier than need be.
[02:26:00.761 --> 02:26:08.927]  But I've said this over the last seven months that there's come times within the last seven months where we have been pushed to a point of violence.
[02:26:08.927 --> 02:26:12.349]  You don't vote your way out of socialism once it takes root.
[02:26:12.349 --> 02:26:18.954]  The only way to eradicate it is to fight with arms to have a violent, violent confrontation, have blood in the streets.
[02:26:19.714 --> 02:26:27.982]  I hate to say that, but it's the reality of where we're at, Alex, and if the mechanism for fixing it is broken, then we need to fix the mechanism.
[02:26:27.982 --> 02:26:32.286]  You don't fix it by talking, by rallying, by even voting.
[02:26:32.286 --> 02:26:36.710]  You fix that mechanism by violent overthrow.
[02:26:36.710 --> 02:26:42.095]  You fix it by storming the chambers and forcibly removing those people that are oppressing you.
[02:26:42.535 --> 02:26:53.338]  You change things by rallying the troops to take up arms, to learn how to use their guns, by stocking food, by making bases, making compounds, and getting ready to fight.
[02:26:53.338 --> 02:26:54.659]  And listen, we're prepared to do that.
[02:26:54.659 --> 02:27:03.001]  And I'm amazed and impressed and proud of the American people because I've had so many people reach out to me and tell me, hey look, I went out and bought a gun.
[02:27:03.001 --> 02:27:04.342]  I went out and learned how to use a gun.
[02:27:04.342 --> 02:27:05.542]  I took some classes.
[02:27:05.542 --> 02:27:10.824]  I'm practicing every day on how to shoot this gun, on how to protect my home, how to protect my property, how to protect my children.
[02:27:11.504 --> 02:27:19.429]  And I see the quote you just put up there, you know, I'm not gonna live on my knees, you know, but I will die on my feet fighting, Alex.
[02:27:19.429 --> 02:27:21.870]  I know that there's millions and millions and more every day.
[02:27:21.870 --> 02:27:26.053]  And the big secret is when you give in to tyranny, you die on your knees anyways.
[02:27:28.100 --> 02:27:28.821]  Absolutely.
[02:27:28.821 --> 02:27:30.802]  I don't know how to lay down.
[02:27:30.802 --> 02:27:32.904]  Here I am, I'm running my bar, running my restaurant.
[02:27:32.904 --> 02:27:33.824]  We're not wearing masks.
[02:27:33.824 --> 02:27:35.025]  We're doing what we're doing.
[02:27:35.025 --> 02:27:35.725]  People are happy.
[02:27:35.725 --> 02:27:36.246]  We're packed.
[02:27:36.246 --> 02:27:37.146]  We're full.
[02:27:37.146 --> 02:27:40.949]  And people say to me over and over again, you know, thank you for what you're doing.
[02:27:40.949 --> 02:27:41.830]  We're fighting with you.
[02:27:41.830 --> 02:27:43.571]  You just say the word if we ever have to fight.
[02:27:43.571 --> 02:27:44.091]  Oh, I agree.
[02:27:44.091 --> 02:27:46.613]  I won't go anywhere that pushes a mask stuff.
[02:27:46.613 --> 02:27:47.854]  And they all wonder why they're empty.
[02:27:47.854 --> 02:27:50.175]  When I go to the place that doesn't wear the mask, they're full.
[02:27:50.175 --> 02:27:51.676]  It's voting with our dollars now.
[02:27:51.676 --> 02:27:56.379]  I tell people we need to act now peacefully to avoid the war.
[02:27:56.379 --> 02:27:57.240]  How do we avoid the war?
[02:27:58.955 --> 02:28:03.516]  We avoid the war by becoming normal right now, not tomorrow, Alex.
[02:28:03.516 --> 02:28:04.496]  I said this earlier.
[02:28:04.496 --> 02:28:05.696]  We got to take off our masks right now.
[02:28:05.696 --> 02:28:10.177]  We need to go outside and live our lives like this never happened, you know, because it is a hoax.
[02:28:10.177 --> 02:28:11.037]  That's how you deal with hoaxes.
[02:28:11.037 --> 02:28:11.937]  You ignore them.
[02:28:11.937 --> 02:28:12.857]  You don't abide by them.
[02:28:12.857 --> 02:28:13.558]  You don't comply.
[02:28:13.558 --> 02:28:14.918]  You don't wait for things to change.
[02:28:14.918 --> 02:28:19.038]  You walk outside your house every morning and you live your damn life, you know, the way that you're supposed to.
[02:28:19.038 --> 02:28:20.439]  And you encourage your neighbors to do the same.
[02:28:20.439 --> 02:28:22.079]  When they see you doing it, guess what?
[02:28:22.079 --> 02:28:23.039]  They're going to do it too.
[02:28:23.039 --> 02:28:24.839]  And when their neighbors see them doing it, guess what?
[02:28:24.839 --> 02:28:26.940]  It's going to trickle on down the line like a domino effect.
[02:28:26.940 --> 02:28:27.720]  And before you know it,
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:31.682]  Our towns, our cities, and our states and country are going to be back to normal.
[02:28:49.329 --> 02:28:54.414]  Probably a more tame message, but I bet once you were up there, the spirit hit you had a responsibility.
[02:28:54.414 --> 02:28:58.858]  I'm saying everyone has a responsibility now to issue the warnings before things get physical.
[02:28:58.858 --> 02:29:01.681]  Because we're really to fight and die, which people are ready for, folks.
[02:29:01.681 --> 02:29:02.782]  We're coming to that point.
[02:29:02.782 --> 02:29:05.124]  We better fight now, peacefully, to stop it.
[02:29:07.301 --> 02:29:13.607]  You know, the moment makes the man, the moment makes the leader, makes the person, and that was just my moment, Alex.
[02:29:13.607 --> 02:29:15.349]  I felt the emotion of the moment.
[02:29:15.349 --> 02:29:21.975]  I got wrapped up in it in a good way, and I think that I met that moment head-on, and thankfully I did because
[02:29:22.876 --> 02:29:24.437]  I was at the airport in St.
[02:29:24.437 --> 02:29:27.401]  Louis and somebody comes up to me and says, hey, you're that guy who was on Alex Jones' show.
[02:29:27.401 --> 02:29:30.023]  Well, because of you, I went and opened my business.
[02:29:30.023 --> 02:29:31.165]  So we're doing positive things.
[02:29:31.165 --> 02:29:37.191]  If one person, if just one American goes and opens their business because of something I said or something you said, Alex.
[02:29:38.352 --> 02:29:41.334]  The work that we're doing is great, and it's important, and we gotta keep fighting.
[02:29:41.334 --> 02:29:42.575]  So I'm encouraged.
[02:29:42.575 --> 02:29:44.956]  You know, I know there's a lot of negativity out there, and it sucks.
[02:29:44.956 --> 02:29:46.978]  I mean, it's real shit.
[02:29:46.978 --> 02:29:56.003]  But let me tell you right now that if we keep speaking our minds, if we keep fighting for this normalcy, and if we keep threatening violence, we're gonna get pretty far.
[02:29:56.003 --> 02:29:58.045]  Because I hate to say it, there has to be a threat of violence.
[02:29:58.045 --> 02:30:00.806]  You know, our words without violence... Well, they're violently bankrupting us!
[02:30:00.806 --> 02:30:04.148]  They're violently shipping people into nursing homes to kill them!
[02:30:04.148 --> 02:30:04.829]  I'm sorry, you're right.
[02:30:05.269 --> 02:30:06.190]  Explain that to people.
[02:30:06.190 --> 02:30:08.632]  Because when the government fears the people, there is liberty.
[02:30:08.632 --> 02:30:10.113]  When the people fear the government, there's tyranny.
[02:30:10.113 --> 02:30:12.375]  Start over.
[02:30:12.375 --> 02:30:13.316]  Absolutely, you know.
[02:30:13.316 --> 02:30:16.459]  And, you know, if a dog doesn't have teeth, all it has is a bark.
[02:30:16.459 --> 02:30:18.881]  And before you know it, nobody's going to listen to that dog.
[02:30:18.881 --> 02:30:23.184]  And our teeth is our ability to pick up our arms and fight for our rights, right?
[02:30:23.184 --> 02:30:27.368]  The Second Amendment is absolutely a genius part of our Constitution.
[02:30:27.368 --> 02:30:31.752]  Our forefathers had such great foresight to what was to come.
[02:30:31.752 --> 02:30:32.432]  And here we are in 2020.
[02:30:33.933 --> 02:30:37.614]  Facing exactly what they feared would happen.
[02:30:37.614 --> 02:30:40.675]  Without that amendment, the First Amendment means nothing.
[02:30:40.675 --> 02:30:43.996]  Our free speech isn't free unless we have a Second Amendment to protect that.
[02:30:43.996 --> 02:30:44.536]  That's right.
[02:30:44.536 --> 02:30:44.796]  It's true.
[02:30:44.796 --> 02:30:47.737]  It's backed up by the threat of violence.
[02:30:47.737 --> 02:30:48.957]  It absolutely is.
[02:30:48.957 --> 02:30:51.097]  And I'm not a violent... Well, I shouldn't say that.
[02:30:51.097 --> 02:30:52.898]  I am a violent individual.
[02:30:52.898 --> 02:30:53.238]  I buy it.
[02:30:53.238 --> 02:30:53.978]  Let's just say it.
[02:30:53.978 --> 02:30:58.459]  Criminals don't break into your house or my house because they know there's probably a man with a gun.
[02:30:58.459 --> 02:31:01.060]  We're not violent, but we have the capability to be violent.
[02:31:02.307 --> 02:31:04.189]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:31:04.189 --> 02:31:08.274]  And when good men are willing to do bad things, great things will happen.
[02:31:08.274 --> 02:31:17.566]  And it's going to be ugly for a little bit, it's chaotic, but you've got to realize that their number one tool, their mechanism to enforce their agenda is instability.
[02:31:17.566 --> 02:31:19.789]  They're going to try to tip-topple and
[02:31:20.149 --> 02:31:23.512]  Destabilize our society every single day.
[02:31:23.512 --> 02:31:25.974]  So it's up to us to gain that stability back.
[02:31:25.974 --> 02:31:28.877]  And the only way you fight that is with violence.
[02:31:28.877 --> 02:31:30.939]  Alex, I hate to say that, but there's going to come a time.
[02:31:30.939 --> 02:31:32.540]  I mean, look at these clowns in the streets.
[02:31:32.540 --> 02:31:33.301]  Let's call them what they are.
[02:31:33.301 --> 02:31:33.841]  They're savages.
[02:31:33.841 --> 02:31:34.602]  They're animals.
[02:31:34.602 --> 02:31:41.188]  These people in the streets of Portland, in the streets of Seattle, who are destabilizing what was once a great, great city.
[02:31:41.188 --> 02:31:44.611]  Oh, if real men were turned loose five minutes, they'd be shut down instantly.
[02:31:45.762 --> 02:31:47.123]  That they'd be shut down right now.
[02:31:47.123 --> 02:31:48.644]  We could end this thing right now, Alex.
[02:31:48.644 --> 02:31:49.585]  And they better be thankful.
[02:31:49.585 --> 02:31:54.928]  Like I said in my speech, be thankful that we are good and thoughtful citizens, but we're not going to be that much longer.
[02:31:54.928 --> 02:31:56.670]  And we're way past the boiling point.
[02:31:56.670 --> 02:31:59.632]  I mean, this is way over.
[02:31:59.632 --> 02:32:01.833]  At this point, Alex, my business is open.
[02:32:01.833 --> 02:32:07.777]  If they were to shut me down right now, I would put up the call and there'd be, well, hopefully 100,000 people there with guns ready to fight them.
[02:32:07.777 --> 02:32:11.520]  And I don't think they want that fight at this point, which is probably why- Because you called their bluff!
[02:32:12.020 --> 02:32:12.580]  Absolutely.
[02:32:12.580 --> 02:32:20.962]  My dad taught me early on, the way you deal with a bully is you punch them in the mouth as hard as you can.
[02:32:20.962 --> 02:32:21.643]  And that's it.
[02:32:21.643 --> 02:32:22.623]  You don't talk to them.
[02:32:22.623 --> 02:32:23.583]  There's no reasoning.
[02:32:23.583 --> 02:32:26.364]  There's no rationalizing with these people.
[02:32:26.364 --> 02:32:27.844]  You're never going to win an argument with these idiots.
[02:32:42.703 --> 02:32:49.648]  Absolutely, and we're a lot tougher than they are, we're smarter than they are, and we're weaponized and we can use them, you know?
[02:32:49.648 --> 02:32:51.469]  I mean, I don't know if you saw that Bloomberg article.
[02:32:51.469 --> 02:32:53.990]  Maybe we can talk about this later on, Alex, if we have time.
[02:32:53.990 --> 02:33:04.857]  There's a Bloomberg article written by Michael Lewis a couple weeks ago, and he came up here and made us look like a bunch of retarded hillbillies, you know, in his article.
[02:33:04.857 --> 02:33:08.600]  And what he's got to know is that we are much smarter, we're much more strategic, and we're patient.
[02:33:09.020 --> 02:33:13.322]  But when the time comes, when that patience runs out, it's people like him who are going to be hiding behind us.
[02:33:13.322 --> 02:33:19.004]  Well, I love that he's like Marie Antoinette saying, let them eat cake, right before the French Revolution.
[02:33:19.004 --> 02:33:24.886]  I mean, he's literally this elitist like, like his boss Bloomberg saying, farmers, they're dumb.
[02:33:24.886 --> 02:33:27.527]  They just grow, they just stick a seed in the ground.
[02:33:27.527 --> 02:33:28.848]  Oh yeah, that's all you do as a farmer.
[02:33:28.848 --> 02:33:29.688]  Yeah, right.
[02:33:29.688 --> 02:33:31.069]  Let's come back and talk about that.
[02:33:31.069 --> 02:33:31.669]  Give us the headline.
[02:33:31.669 --> 02:33:33.370]  We'll put it up and we'll talk about
[02:33:34.383 --> 02:33:35.524]  Let's say Trump loses.
[02:33:35.524 --> 02:33:36.965]  Let's say they assassinate Trump.
[02:33:36.965 --> 02:33:38.286]  Let's talk about bad scenarios.
[02:33:38.286 --> 02:33:39.687]  Let's talk about targets.
[02:33:39.687 --> 02:33:40.468]  Not that we're gonna target.
[02:33:40.468 --> 02:33:42.830]  We're just hypothetically talking about wargaming.
[02:33:42.830 --> 02:33:46.693]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[02:33:46.693 --> 02:33:51.017]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[02:33:51.017 --> 02:33:59.504]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them a bottle of Ultimate Fish Oil from InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:33:59.804 --> 02:34:16.471]  Recent studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[02:34:16.471 --> 02:34:27.515]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[02:34:27.995 --> 02:34:36.486]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality.
[02:34:36.486 --> 02:34:42.053]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:34:43.354 --> 02:34:56.923]  For more than a hundred years, the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world government, abolish nation states, dumb down the population by taking control of education, and most importantly, taking control of Western medicine.
[02:34:56.923 --> 02:34:58.904]  Now, they had a bad name by the 1920s.
[02:34:58.904 --> 02:35:07.370]  They started converting over and funding other organizations and groups, like IBM, to continue on with their eugenics operations.
[02:35:08.090 --> 02:35:18.241]  Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates III, his father of course being the head of Planned Parenthood.
[02:35:18.241 --> 02:35:25.829]  And now, he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the world, every national health system.
[02:35:26.229 --> 02:35:28.290]  Bill Gates is in control.
[02:35:28.290 --> 02:35:36.213]  They have spent a hundred plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in your body.
[02:35:36.213 --> 02:35:42.416]  This is the holy grail of their operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type of DNA in your body.
[02:35:44.699 --> 02:35:58.270]  For more than a hundred years, the Rockefeller Foundation has worked to establish world government, abolish nation states, dumb down the population by taking control of education, and most importantly, taking control of Western medicine.
[02:35:58.270 --> 02:36:00.251]  Now, they had a bad name by the 1920s.
[02:36:00.251 --> 02:36:08.718]  They started converting over and funding other organizations and groups, like IBM, to continue on with their eugenics operations.
[02:36:09.438 --> 02:36:19.565]  Fast forward to the 1980s, the baton is handed by IBM via his mother on the board of directors to Bill Gates III, his father, of course, being the head of Planned Parenthood.
[02:36:19.565 --> 02:36:27.591]  And now he's been able to position himself over almost every health department in the world, every national health system.
[02:36:27.591 --> 02:36:29.653]  Bill Gates is in control.
[02:36:29.653 --> 02:36:30.173]  They have spent
[02:36:30.533 --> 02:36:37.560]  A hundred plus years getting positioned to be able to control what happens to your body and what goes in your body.
[02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:43.767]  This is the holy grail of their operations and now they're normalizing putting a new type of DNA in your body.

[02:37:13.534 --> 02:37:14.075]  The system
[02:37:15.015 --> 02:37:19.758]  Trump is censoring because of the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[02:37:19.758 --> 02:37:24.601]  Trump has finally figured this out and says he's going to take action, once re-elected, against big tech.
[02:37:24.601 --> 02:37:26.102]  And then he's moderating the situation.
[02:37:26.102 --> 02:37:30.544]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry because he has to take an action.
[02:37:30.544 --> 02:37:41.411]  We the people are taking action now, and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionsCenter.com, 2020ElectionsCenter.com, and checking out the new, redesigned InfoWars.com and sharing that link.
[02:37:41.411 --> 02:37:42.691]  Oh, that really upsets them.
[02:37:42.691 --> 02:37:43.232]  Oh, yeah.
[02:37:47.446 --> 02:37:57.269]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:37:57.269 --> 02:37:59.469]  We must resume life now.
[02:37:59.469 --> 02:38:03.610]  Texas County Judge calls on Governor to reopen all businesses to 100% capacity.
[02:38:03.610 --> 02:38:06.951]  Listen to Don Steltzner's article on Infowars.com.
[02:38:12.675 --> 02:38:14.258]  There's another one.
[02:38:14.258 --> 02:38:18.664]  WHO Europe director says government should stop enforcing lockdowns.
[02:38:18.664 --> 02:38:21.168]  Says shutdown of economy starving the third world.
[02:38:22.701 --> 02:38:25.942]  Is that them realizing the world's awakened and it's pissed?
[02:38:25.942 --> 02:38:27.863]  Covering their ass from what they've already done?
[02:38:27.863 --> 02:38:30.684]  Regardless, they're having to admit we're right now.
[02:38:30.684 --> 02:38:45.410]  Carlos Zapata, that's a far cry from the October 1st article just 12 days ago saying you're a crazy evil person in the Bloomberg article inside a California revolt.
[02:38:45.410 --> 02:38:46.731]  So some big victories right now.
[02:38:49.111 --> 02:38:49.632]  Yes, sir.
[02:38:49.632 --> 02:38:59.929]  You know, it's pretty funny because when that guy came up here, he wasn't going to write an article about us, about me, or about the other leaders in this movement.
[02:38:59.929 --> 02:39:02.553]  It was really to come up here and see what was going on in Shasta County.
[02:39:03.656 --> 02:39:11.184]  Our CEO, Matt Pontes, who's an absolute criminal, has put out the call to come up and see what we were doing.
[02:39:11.184 --> 02:39:15.268]  He sort of turned him on to us at that moment.
[02:39:15.268 --> 02:39:17.811]  He pivoted toward us and we went and had coffee.
[02:39:17.811 --> 02:39:20.154]  Obviously, they're always real nice in person.
[02:39:20.154 --> 02:39:22.596]  They're always real kind and sweet.
[02:39:22.596 --> 02:39:25.719]  Oh, it's shocking how nice they are when they stick the knife in your back.
[02:39:27.394 --> 02:39:28.995]  Absolutely, and then I knew it, and I knew it.
[02:39:28.995 --> 02:39:31.777]  Listen, we all knew exactly what was going to happen.
[02:39:31.777 --> 02:39:42.985]  That article wasn't there to paint us in a good light, but we figured that those who read it would see through the bullshit if they were on our side, and if they weren't, you know, they would continue to be fooled, and that's okay, too.
[02:39:42.985 --> 02:39:50.390]  Oh yeah, I had a meeting with a big globalist the other day, off record, and I just told him, I said, go ahead and do your lies, people are going to see through you.
[02:39:50.390 --> 02:39:51.431]  He actually understood that.
[02:39:51.431 --> 02:39:56.034]  They know now that the worse the lies, the more people just up front don't believe them.
[02:39:58.324 --> 02:39:59.705]  Absolutely.
[02:39:59.705 --> 02:40:02.207]  And listen, we are smart people.
[02:40:02.207 --> 02:40:03.167]  We're educated people.
[02:40:03.167 --> 02:40:04.468]  We're people who read every day.
[02:40:04.468 --> 02:40:07.190]  We're people who run businesses.
[02:40:07.190 --> 02:40:08.111]  We raise families.
[02:40:08.111 --> 02:40:09.592]  We're not dummies, Alex.
[02:40:09.592 --> 02:40:12.894]  And I think you know this, and I see what you're putting up right there with the State of Jefferson.
[02:40:12.894 --> 02:40:13.774]  That's a big movement.
[02:40:13.774 --> 02:40:15.195]  I'd love to come on sometime.
[02:40:15.195 --> 02:40:16.416]  Come on tomorrow.
[02:40:16.416 --> 02:40:17.036]  Come on next week.
[02:40:17.036 --> 02:40:17.977]  Tell us about the State of Jefferson.
[02:40:19.731 --> 02:40:20.871]  I'd love to talk about that.
[02:40:20.871 --> 02:40:30.353]  I won't take the time right now because that's a big topic and I'd love to bring my friend Terry Raposo on the show because he's a great, smart... Anytime you want, or we'll fly you guys here, but let me just stop you there.
[02:40:30.353 --> 02:40:31.453]  The time we do have left.
[02:40:31.453 --> 02:40:32.774]  Let's talk worst case scenario.
[02:40:32.774 --> 02:40:34.294]  They assassinate Trump.
[02:40:34.294 --> 02:40:43.456]  They're able to, I mean, they say, Keith Olbermann, I'm sure you saw the clip, said, we will dominate their supporters, we'll put them in prison, we're going to eradicate them, we're going to exterminate them.
[02:40:43.456 --> 02:40:45.856]  This is classic Weatherman terminology.
[02:40:45.856 --> 02:40:48.397]  Folks need to know, they really mean to do this.
[02:40:48.917 --> 02:40:51.838]  So, people, I mean, what do you see that look like?
[02:40:51.838 --> 02:40:54.318]  I don't want to go kill Antifa in downtown.
[02:40:54.318 --> 02:40:55.939]  That's, they want us to go have that fight.
[02:40:55.939 --> 02:41:00.419]  If it goes into martial law, God forbid, who are the main targets here?
[02:41:00.419 --> 02:41:02.280]  They're going to go after us, but who are the targets?
[02:41:02.280 --> 02:41:07.041]  I guess, leftist leaders, their people?
[02:41:07.041 --> 02:41:16.723]  Yeah, you know, and here's, absolutely, you know, but here's the deal, Alex, it's not as simple as establishing a list of targets or a target list and going after them.
[02:41:17.841 --> 02:41:23.903]  At that point, I think we need to have very well-repaired and structured militias.
[02:41:23.903 --> 02:41:32.305]  And we're real blessed up here to have leaders such as... You're saying deny them government, just make our own governments and ignore them, is the way to cut them off, is what you're saying?
[02:41:35.425 --> 02:41:49.620]  100% we have to turn internal, we have to turn into our small towns and cities and really gather our resources here in our very locally needed areas and use that because at that point it's not going to be
[02:41:50.641 --> 02:41:56.686]  Really beneficial for us to go, to leave our areas, to go fight a target that's outside of where we live.
[02:41:56.686 --> 02:42:06.354]  I think we have to cling on to a well-established militia locally and protect our areas, our families, and sort of internalize at that point, if that makes any sense.
[02:42:06.354 --> 02:42:10.257]  Because if we all do that... Notary, all politics is local.
[02:42:10.257 --> 02:42:12.419]  The enemy wants to seize the local.
[02:42:12.419 --> 02:42:18.364]  So during a civil war, we just have to establish local constitutional government and operate from that perspective.
[02:42:20.658 --> 02:42:22.700]  Absolutely, and it's going to be a blocking play, right?
[02:42:22.700 --> 02:42:31.290]  I mean, we're absolutely going to block them from getting any kind of root hold on our cities, counties, states, whatever it might be.
[02:42:31.290 --> 02:42:32.352]  And we're really lucky up here.
[02:42:32.352 --> 02:42:35.075]  We're very, very lucky to have a very well-prepared militia.
[02:42:35.075 --> 02:42:39.019]  No, I agree, but can you believe we had to talk about this seriously in late 2020?
[02:42:39.019 --> 02:42:39.280]  No, I can't.
[02:42:41.802 --> 02:42:46.867]  If you would have asked me a year ago if I'd ever, you know, associate myself with any kind of militia, I would have said, hell no.
[02:42:46.867 --> 02:42:48.589]  Those guys are nuts, man, you know.
[02:42:48.589 --> 02:42:57.037]  I picture some guy up in the hills with a long beard, you know, jumping over barrels and practicing shooting, you know, and I'm telling you right now that that's not what they are.
[02:42:57.037 --> 02:43:01.621]  These guys are very, very smart, very prepared, and very strategic and ready to fight.
[02:43:01.621 --> 02:43:04.344]  Well, sure, it's just people that saw this coming.
[02:43:04.344 --> 02:43:05.525]  People that saw this coming.
[02:43:07.114 --> 02:43:07.714]  They did.
[02:43:07.714 --> 02:43:08.995]  They absolutely did.
[02:43:08.995 --> 02:43:21.341]  And guys like you, Alex, I have so much respect and admiration for what you've done over the years, where people like me, maybe we weren't listening before, but we're certainly listening and aligning ourselves now because we're living it.
[02:43:21.341 --> 02:43:24.262]  We're no longer reading about it or hearing about it, Alex.
[02:43:24.262 --> 02:43:25.603]  I am living this right now.
[02:43:25.603 --> 02:43:29.805]  I'm living this very real attack on my family, on my business, on my freedoms.
[02:43:30.505 --> 02:43:31.186]  And what am I to do?
[02:43:31.186 --> 02:43:32.448]  I mean, I can't lay down.
[02:43:32.448 --> 02:43:34.430]  We gotta fight, and that's the next step.
[02:43:34.430 --> 02:43:37.654]  And how we get there is laid out for us as well.
[02:43:37.654 --> 02:43:39.416]  And again, we don't want to go there.
[02:43:39.416 --> 02:43:41.198]  We're not planning anything.
[02:43:41.198 --> 02:43:49.767]  The point is, we're under corporate financial attack, and now Bill Gates is coming with a vaccine that he admits makes you sick.
[02:43:49.767 --> 02:43:50.969]  That's a violent assault.
[02:43:54.130 --> 02:43:56.151]  You know, it's as simple as this.
[02:43:56.151 --> 02:44:02.252]  Two weeks ago, I woke up to check my bank accounts because I had to pay some bills, and my business accounts were all closed.
[02:44:02.252 --> 02:44:04.593]  Every one of them were closed.
[02:44:04.593 --> 02:44:11.915]  The bank, because we do a lot of cash business, we deposit some cash into the bank when we have to pay bills, apparently we've made too many cash deposits.
[02:44:11.915 --> 02:44:13.555]  Brother, that wasn't what it was.
[02:44:13.555 --> 02:44:15.455]  They did that to me a month ago, too.
[02:44:15.455 --> 02:44:17.056]  They're taking everybody's bank account right now.
[02:44:19.247 --> 02:44:19.809]  Absolutely.
[02:44:19.809 --> 02:44:23.399]  And I talked to my merchant services people and they said that it was...
[02:44:24.617 --> 02:44:27.359]  That was going on everywhere, so we weren't alone in that.
[02:44:27.359 --> 02:44:28.700]  No, I talked to the merchant accounts.
[02:44:28.700 --> 02:44:30.081]  We lost a bunch of bank accounts a month ago.
[02:44:30.081 --> 02:44:31.022]  I haven't announced that yet.
[02:44:31.022 --> 02:44:32.543]  We finally got some back.
[02:44:32.543 --> 02:44:39.748]  But yeah, they said, Mr. Jones, we have thousands of people calling us gun owners, gun shops, sporting goods shops.
[02:44:39.748 --> 02:44:43.371]  Anybody that's a registered Republican who's prominent, they're losing their accounts.
[02:44:43.371 --> 02:44:45.633]  The commies are already making their move right now.
[02:44:45.633 --> 02:44:46.854]  Your family grew up under this.
[02:44:46.854 --> 02:44:47.814]  People don't understand.
[02:44:47.814 --> 02:44:50.597]  The commies cut your bank accounts off.
[02:44:50.597 --> 02:44:51.057]  They lived it.
[02:44:52.012 --> 02:44:52.833]  Absolutely.
[02:44:52.833 --> 02:44:54.134]  They live this, Alex.
[02:44:54.134 --> 02:44:56.857]  And this road is a very, very dark one.
[02:44:56.857 --> 02:44:57.998]  It's a very perilous one.
[02:44:57.998 --> 02:44:59.800]  And if we want to go down that road, it doesn't end well.
[02:44:59.800 --> 02:45:00.761]  There's no light at the end of this.
[02:45:00.761 --> 02:45:03.684]  I was about to say, you want to take our bank accounts away and starve us?
[02:45:03.684 --> 02:45:04.925]  You die next!
[02:45:04.925 --> 02:45:05.565]  Yeah.
[02:45:05.565 --> 02:45:06.867]  You keep pushing your trap!
[02:45:09.395 --> 02:45:11.477]  Absolutely, you know, and here we are, we're living it.
[02:45:11.477 --> 02:45:13.839]  It's no longer theoretical, it's no longer in the future.
[02:45:13.839 --> 02:45:15.461]  Here we are, we are living it.
[02:45:15.461 --> 02:45:19.625]  And there's people standing up, Alex, you know, be encouraged, as negative as we can be.
[02:45:19.625 --> 02:45:24.190]  I was about to say, look how the left folds every time somebody fights him.
[02:45:24.190 --> 02:45:29.356]  Do you think Chuckie Schumer and them realize what they're conjuring, Mr. Zapata?
[02:45:31.187 --> 02:45:32.027]  Absolutely not.
[02:45:32.027 --> 02:45:36.110]  And I'll tell you what, that Gavin Newsom is getting a taste right now of his own medicine.
[02:45:36.110 --> 02:45:38.272]  He's seen what a free people can do.
[02:45:38.272 --> 02:45:42.375]  He's seen that freedom is anecdotal to what he's doing.
[02:45:42.375 --> 02:45:46.559]  And the antidote, the medicine to what he's doing is simply to live our lives and tell him to screw himself.
[02:45:46.559 --> 02:45:47.499]  And we've done that.
[02:45:47.499 --> 02:45:48.400]  He hates it.
[02:45:48.400 --> 02:45:51.282]  He's an egomaniac and he is... He's a total psycho.
[02:45:51.282 --> 02:45:51.883]  He's panicking.
[02:45:51.883 --> 02:45:54.265]  Explain to people how he's totally hated now.
[02:45:55.751 --> 02:45:57.152]  He's completely hated now.
[02:45:57.152 --> 02:46:00.194]  I have friends that voted for the guy who wants to shoot him now.
[02:46:00.194 --> 02:46:02.395]  They're not going to, don't worry.
[02:46:02.395 --> 02:46:04.416]  But there's people that absolutely hate him.
[02:46:04.416 --> 02:46:05.777]  Nobody's going to vote for him again.
[02:46:05.777 --> 02:46:10.280]  And I wouldn't be surprised if he lost the next election here in California, to be honest with you.
[02:46:10.280 --> 02:46:12.261]  God, he is such a fake piece of crap.
[02:46:12.261 --> 02:46:15.923]  Don't you thank your sweet God every morning you're not Gavin Newsom, Carlos Zapata.
[02:46:15.923 --> 02:46:19.225]  I thank God every day I'm not a piece of garbage like him.
[02:46:21.362 --> 02:46:26.184]  Every single day, there's a great interview out there with him and Adam Carolla that's pretty old now.
[02:46:26.184 --> 02:46:31.166]  It's probably maybe even 10-15 years old, you know, but he starts off talking like he's a conservative.
[02:46:31.166 --> 02:46:36.448]  He starts off talking about, you know, his obstacles and challenges that he met as a young business owner.
[02:46:36.448 --> 02:46:38.068]  And all of a sudden, he takes his hard left.
[02:46:38.068 --> 02:46:40.269]  I said, well, how do you get from here to there, right?
[02:46:40.269 --> 02:46:44.731]  And that plays into what we're talking about right here, Alex, where somewhere along the line, somebody bought him off.
[02:46:45.171 --> 02:46:50.035]  Somewhere along the line, somebody groomed him to fill the role that he's filling right now, right?
[02:46:50.035 --> 02:47:00.023]  Because you don't go from being a business owner, overcoming government obstacles, and hating those government obstacles, to all of a sudden being the oppressor, right?
[02:47:00.023 --> 02:47:06.509]  You don't go from being the oppressed to the oppressor, without at some point being bought by somebody, and he was definitely bought, so.
[02:47:06.509 --> 02:47:07.089]  Damn right.
[02:47:07.089 --> 02:47:10.012]  Well, listen, get your buddy on next week for an hour.
[02:47:10.012 --> 02:47:13.615]  Let's talk about the state of Jefferson, because I want to get behind that.
[02:47:14.460 --> 02:47:16.402]  I want to get involved.
[02:47:16.402 --> 02:47:18.784]  That right there will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up Alex.
[02:47:18.784 --> 02:47:24.449]  It's a great, we'll have a great hour talking about that because there's a great movement going on and it's going to happen.
[02:47:24.449 --> 02:47:26.491]  We're closer than ever now to making that happen.
[02:47:26.491 --> 02:47:32.936]  I would love to get Terry Raposa on this show with me and with you and that'll be really enjoyable for all your guests as well.
[02:47:32.936 --> 02:47:33.997]  Well I'm excited.
[02:47:33.997 --> 02:47:37.981]  People look at California with a message and they say look at that, Texas is almost blue folks.
[02:47:38.581 --> 02:47:43.144]  We're almost what California was, so I don't look at California as like, oh, with some pleasure.
[02:47:43.144 --> 02:47:51.310]  I look at California, a beautiful state, with a lot of sadness, but the word is people are really waking up that you could end up having the state flip red, is what I'm hearing.
[02:47:51.310 --> 02:48:00.757]  Even, um, even, uh, you know, the host of, uh, whatever that damn HBO show is, what the hell his name is, Bill Maher, was like, everybody's leaving.
[02:48:00.757 --> 02:48:01.998]  What are you going to do to Shiv?
[02:48:01.998 --> 02:48:04.520]  And Shiv didn't know what to say.
[02:48:04.520 --> 02:48:05.060]  Absolutely.
[02:48:05.060 --> 02:48:06.481]  And we all have a common enemy.
[02:48:06.481 --> 02:48:07.442]  If there's anything that
[02:48:08.515 --> 02:48:17.341]  He's galvanized us and kind of bound us together by, not by our differences, but by our common enemy that we have now.
[02:48:17.341 --> 02:48:20.362]  America is unifying against communism and tyranny.
[02:48:20.362 --> 02:48:21.863]  America is alive and awake.
[02:48:21.863 --> 02:48:23.965]  The sleeping giant is rising.
[02:48:23.965 --> 02:48:26.326]  Carlos Zapata, we'll talk to you next with your friend.
[02:48:26.326 --> 02:48:27.827]  We love you and salute you.
[02:48:27.827 --> 02:48:29.688]  Hour number four with Paul Joseph Watson.
[02:48:29.688 --> 02:48:30.369]  Straight ahead.
[02:48:30.369 --> 02:48:31.089]  The answer to 1984.
[02:48:37.100 --> 02:48:51.875]  InfoWars has been banned.
[02:48:51.875 --> 02:48:55.959]  Arrested.
[02:48:55.959 --> 02:48:57.501]  Attacked and threatened.
[02:48:58.722 --> 02:49:00.444]  Because we are effective.
[02:49:00.444 --> 02:49:03.868]  The Great Awakening is here.

[02:50:24.731 --> 02:50:26.913]  And fun, the second American Revolution.
[02:50:26.913 --> 02:50:30.616]  Worldwide, you are the resistance, the resistance, the resistance.
[02:50:36.889 --> 02:50:55.444]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:55.444 --> 02:51:00.668]  You're listening to a Paul Joseph Watson Frontline Report.
[02:51:00.668 --> 02:51:04.291]  If you're receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:51:06.431 --> 02:51:11.954]  Now, Paul Joseph Watson just had a power outage in our Britannic majesty's London, England.
[02:51:11.954 --> 02:51:14.936]  They should be up with us in the next ten minutes or so.
[02:51:14.936 --> 02:51:18.598]  So you're stuck with me, the Potbellied Possum.
[02:51:18.598 --> 02:51:21.579]  Riders on the storm.
[02:51:21.579 --> 02:51:26.222]  Riders on the storm.
[02:51:26.222 --> 02:51:28.943]  Riders on the storm.
[02:51:28.943 --> 02:51:30.664]  To this world we're born.
[02:51:30.664 --> 02:51:32.585]  And to this house we're born.
[02:51:32.585 --> 02:51:33.366]  To this world we're from.
[02:51:35.494 --> 02:51:39.537]  She don't have a teleprompter.
[02:51:39.537 --> 02:51:40.517]  Take a long holiday.
[02:51:40.517 --> 02:51:41.998]  Let your children play.
[02:51:41.998 --> 02:51:45.260]  Let's hear from President Trump about
[02:52:06.226 --> 02:52:08.967]  The lockdowns.
[02:52:08.967 --> 02:52:17.812]  And the Florida tourism and hospitality industries that I know so well will reach historic new highs, highs like they've never reached before.
[02:52:17.812 --> 02:52:28.118]  Biden would terminate our recovery, delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, and annihilate Florida's economy with a draconian, unscientific lockdown.
[02:52:28.118 --> 02:52:29.659]  That's what he wants to do, lock it down.
[02:52:30.899 --> 02:52:32.280]  Lock it down, everybody.
[02:52:32.280 --> 02:52:32.880]  And you know what?
[02:52:32.880 --> 02:52:35.102]  If you don't feel good about going out, stay.
[02:52:35.102 --> 02:52:35.862]  Relax.
[02:52:35.862 --> 02:52:36.202]  Stay.
[02:52:36.202 --> 02:52:37.223]  You know the risk groups.
[02:52:37.223 --> 02:52:39.584]  You know the older people.
[02:52:39.584 --> 02:52:40.985]  See, fortunately, I'm not an old person.
[02:52:40.985 --> 02:52:45.227]  I'm very young, and I'm in such perfect shape.
[02:52:45.227 --> 02:52:45.668]  Right?
[02:52:45.668 --> 02:52:47.809]  I'm in such great shape.
[02:52:47.809 --> 02:52:49.470]  You know, I said that the other day.
[02:52:49.470 --> 02:52:50.030]  What do you do?
[02:52:50.030 --> 02:52:52.791]  I said, well, I'm very young, and I'm in great shape, perfect shape.
[02:52:52.791 --> 02:52:56.794]  And they said, Donald Trump misrepresented today again.
[02:52:56.794 --> 02:52:58.895]  He said he was in great shape, but he's very young.
[02:52:59.944 --> 02:53:01.747]  These people are the sickest of them all.
[02:53:11.185 --> 02:53:13.987]  But the World Health Organization, did you see what happened?
[02:53:13.987 --> 02:53:18.790]  They just came out a little while ago, and they admitted that Donald Trump was right.
[02:53:18.790 --> 02:53:32.881]  The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat run states where they're locked down, sealed up, suicide rates, drug rates, alcoholism, death by so many different forms.
[02:53:33.661 --> 02:53:34.822]  You can't do that.
[02:53:34.822 --> 02:53:37.885]  And I want to just congratulate the governor and everybody in Florida.
[02:53:37.885 --> 02:53:39.767]  You're open and open for business.
[02:53:41.661 --> 02:53:44.944]  And for the World Health Organization, I took us out.
[02:53:44.944 --> 02:53:46.065]  They said, why'd you do that?
[02:53:46.065 --> 02:53:52.372]  I said, number one, they were wrong on everything, although they corrected themselves today and they said I was right for the lockdowns.
[02:53:52.372 --> 02:53:56.376]  But I said, number two, why are we paying 500 million a year?
[02:53:56.376 --> 02:54:01.060]  And China, which has 1.4 billion people, is paying 39 million a year.
[02:54:01.060 --> 02:54:01.601]  Explain that.
[02:54:01.601 --> 02:54:02.422]  They couldn't explain.
[02:54:02.422 --> 02:54:03.523]  It was very hard to explain.
[02:54:05.836 --> 02:54:06.917]  So there you go.
[02:54:06.917 --> 02:54:07.777]  Vindication.
[02:54:07.777 --> 02:54:09.198]  Trump on all cylinders.
[02:54:09.198 --> 02:54:11.319]  And they are so upset.
[02:54:11.319 --> 02:54:12.360]  They are so unhappy.
[02:54:12.360 --> 02:54:14.741]  They are so angry right now.
[02:54:14.741 --> 02:54:17.763]  But Acosta responds to CNN sucks.
[02:54:17.763 --> 02:54:19.083]  Let's play the club.
[02:54:19.083 --> 02:54:21.985]  Well, it's better than dying of COVID.
[02:54:21.985 --> 02:54:26.968]  So his only answer is, you're dying of COVID, America, when no one watches Jim Acosta.
[02:54:26.968 --> 02:54:27.308]  Here it is.
[02:54:31.164 --> 02:54:37.782]  And as this crowd is chanting that there are members of the press here who suck, I should also point out, Wolf, what also sucks?
[02:54:37.782 --> 02:54:38.665]  Getting the coronavirus.
[02:54:39.477 --> 02:54:42.319]  Well, that would be really, really awful.
[02:54:42.319 --> 02:54:46.021]  Over the weekend, the president said the coronavirus was disappearing.
[02:54:46.021 --> 02:54:47.662]  Clearly, it's not disappearing.
[02:54:47.662 --> 02:54:48.963]  It's getting a whole lot worse.
[02:54:48.963 --> 02:54:49.604]  Sorry, Jim Acosta.
[02:54:49.604 --> 02:54:50.764]  It never goes away.
[02:54:50.764 --> 02:54:51.685]  Everyone gets it.
[02:54:51.685 --> 02:54:53.186]  Hardly any die from it.
[02:54:53.186 --> 02:54:54.347]  But they do more testing.
[02:54:54.347 --> 02:54:57.049]  It's just endless leftists terrorizing you.
[02:54:57.049 --> 02:54:59.210]  Wolf Blitzer, the con artist.
[02:54:59.210 --> 02:55:02.852]  And then you've got Jim Acosta with a little diaper over his face.
[02:55:02.852 --> 02:55:04.974]  CNN's not the enemy of the people.
[02:55:04.974 --> 02:55:06.375]  CNN's not the enemy of the people.
[02:55:07.608 --> 02:55:10.309]  I think we need a Mars Attacks intro, please.
[02:55:10.309 --> 02:55:13.089]  Jim Acosta, can we get that fan dangled?
[02:55:13.089 --> 02:55:14.890]  Can we get that prepared?
[02:55:14.890 --> 02:55:16.390]  Can we get that honchoed?
[02:55:16.390 --> 02:55:17.411]  Can we get that in the pike?
[02:55:17.411 --> 02:55:19.011]  Can we get that in the main?
[02:55:19.011 --> 02:55:20.191]  Can we get that queued up?
[02:55:20.191 --> 02:55:21.692]  Can we get that on the ready?
[02:55:21.692 --> 02:55:23.912]  Can we get that ready to go main stage?
[02:55:23.912 --> 02:55:25.253]  Can we get that ready to launch?
[02:55:25.253 --> 02:55:27.013]  Can we get it ready to manifest?
[02:55:27.013 --> 02:55:29.174]  Can we get it ready to energize?
[02:55:29.174 --> 02:55:29.614]  Can we get it...
[02:55:30.074 --> 02:55:38.324]  Ready to unfold, we're getting ready to rage, we get ready to explode, we get ready to go absolutely crazy!
[02:55:42.435 --> 02:55:59.789]  Hello, my name is Dr. Fauci, and I've been at the NIH and CDC for 45 years, and I've overseen, well, you know, the AIDS pandemic and so many other things, and I take my orders from Bill Gates, Dr. Bill Gates.
[02:55:59.789 --> 02:56:02.692]  I mean, he's not a doctor, but he controls
[02:56:03.112 --> 02:56:04.934]  Everything you do.
[02:56:04.934 --> 02:56:08.597]  And he now says, you're going to take the shots.
[02:56:08.597 --> 02:56:12.520]  And of course, in England, they are now saying what I told you.
[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:14.281]  You will not be allowed to travel.
[02:56:14.281 --> 02:56:18.424]  Leave your home until you take all the shots.
[02:56:18.424 --> 02:56:19.785]  Dr. Gates, I mean Bill.
[02:56:20.606 --> 02:56:27.510]  Gates, your owner, your master, says you will have to take four to five COVID shots a year.
[02:56:27.510 --> 02:56:33.694]  For adult, two for baby, and baby much more manageable.
[02:56:33.694 --> 02:56:37.117]  Just like Bill Gates give you polio and vaccine.
[02:56:37.117 --> 02:56:40.779]  I'm Dr. Fauci, reminding you that we owe you.
[02:56:44.485 --> 02:56:46.306]  I'm standing in this briefing room right now.
[02:56:46.306 --> 02:57:03.600]  There is no government official here, but I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[02:57:03.600 --> 02:57:07.123]  But I'll say that the press is not the enemy of the people.
[02:57:07.123 --> 02:57:08.724]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[02:57:08.724 --> 02:57:12.507]  The press is not the enemy of the people.
[02:57:33.394 --> 02:57:39.316]  Maybe we should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue like these folks who chant CNN sucks and fake news.
[02:57:39.316 --> 02:57:45.278]  Maybe we should go out, all journalists should go out on Pennsylvania Avenue and chant we're not the enemy of the people.
[02:57:56.823 --> 02:57:58.205]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[02:57:58.205 --> 02:57:59.567]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[02:57:59.567 --> 02:58:00.769]  We're not the enemy of the people.
[02:58:09.762 --> 02:58:10.602]  I'm sorry.
[02:58:10.602 --> 02:58:16.186]  Paul Joseph Watson's getting his power turned back on, which is bad for the carbon footprint.
[02:58:16.186 --> 02:58:17.708]  He doesn't deserve power.
[02:58:17.708 --> 02:58:25.913]  I've got a few stories I want to hit here, but it's your last chance to get 8-pack Power Stack, which funds this operation, which really pisses off the globalists.
[02:58:25.913 --> 02:58:34.580]  13 pills, AM, PM, everything you need for joint, for heart, for stamina, for libido, for energy, for just, you know.
[02:58:35.660 --> 02:58:39.521]  Anti-inflammatory, you name it.
[02:58:39.521 --> 02:58:41.842]  It was not a big seller.
[02:58:41.842 --> 02:58:43.562]  And then people tried it and loved it.
[02:58:43.562 --> 02:58:45.763]  They got five star reviews and it became a big seller.
[02:58:45.763 --> 02:58:50.705]  Now because the COVID lockdown, supply chain's broken down, we can't reorder it.
[02:58:50.705 --> 02:58:52.065]  So there's a very limited amount.
[02:58:52.065 --> 02:58:54.846]  It'll be done by tomorrow.
[02:58:54.846 --> 02:58:56.666]  Look at that, 100% reviews.
[02:58:56.666 --> 02:58:58.207]  My God.
[02:58:58.207 --> 02:58:59.707]  Good God, man.
[02:58:59.707 --> 02:59:02.008]  They'd save Star Trek.
[02:59:02.008 --> 02:59:02.948]  Oh, that's the little extra
[02:59:07.026 --> 02:59:13.149]  The point is, it's at InfowarStore.com and it funds our operation.
[02:59:13.149 --> 02:59:14.550]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:59:14.550 --> 02:59:18.631]  InfowarStore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:59:18.631 --> 02:59:21.573]  Last chance to get 8-Pak Power Stack.
[02:59:21.573 --> 02:59:24.114]  It will be gone tonight or tomorrow.
[02:59:25.639 --> 02:59:33.503]  Separately, we also have the InfoWars blowout sale that is going to have to end in six days because so many things are ready to sell out.
[02:59:33.503 --> 02:59:43.727]  We've got Brain Force Plus, Ultimate Krill Oil, Super Metal Vitality, Survival Shield X2, ExtendoWise, Knockout, Turbo Force, all t-shirts, all SRL products.
[02:59:43.727 --> 02:59:44.368]  Look into those.

[02:59:50.751 --> 02:59:53.192]  The Biden for Nursing Home shirt.
[02:59:54.073 --> 02:59:55.395]  We're not printing any more of those.
[02:59:55.395 --> 02:59:56.497]  Limited edition.
[02:59:56.497 --> 02:59:57.979]  Fauci and Bill Gates for prison.
[02:59:57.979 --> 02:59:59.301]  Limited edition.
[02:59:59.301 --> 03:00:01.444]  Knockouts $14.95.
[03:00:01.444 --> 03:00:02.546]  Wow!

[03:00:05.030 --> 03:00:06.592]  I want to thank you all for keeping us on air.
[03:00:06.592 --> 03:00:08.896]  You've done a fantastic job.
[03:00:12.560 --> 03:00:22.105]  Infowars blowout sale ends in six days, up 60% off, triple Pedro points, free shipping, shop now.
[03:00:22.105 --> 03:00:35.391]  And believe me, Bill Gates is really upset that you are tuning in, because he launched his whole operation with all the robber baron money and all the media and everything, and it's blown up spectacularly in his face.
[03:00:37.847 --> 03:00:41.008]  Here's the thing, I don't want to be too positive, so I don't want you to think we're winning.
[03:00:41.008 --> 03:00:45.490]  Because you might let up and the enemy could win, but we're really kicking some ass right now.
[03:00:45.490 --> 03:00:46.910]  Here, look at the little, see here.
[03:00:46.910 --> 03:00:48.270]  Yeah, man, he's really waking up right now.
[03:00:48.270 --> 03:00:51.852]  We're really kicking some ass.
[03:00:51.852 --> 03:00:56.173]  Now, it's not going to be fun for some of us like me, because they're going to punish me, but that's OK.
[03:00:56.173 --> 03:00:57.734]  I'm kind of in on the joke, so it's all right.
[03:00:57.734 --> 03:00:59.594]  Oh!
[03:01:05.526 --> 03:01:08.647]  Hello, Bill Gates.
[03:01:08.647 --> 03:01:10.208]  Come and help me.
[03:01:10.208 --> 03:01:15.290]  I like you.
[03:01:15.290 --> 03:01:19.272]  Thank you, Bill Gates, for all you do for China.
[03:01:19.272 --> 03:01:22.234]  We teach our people to be a slave now.
[03:01:22.234 --> 03:01:23.534]  Good job, Bill Gates.
[03:01:23.534 --> 03:01:26.416]  They locked up in martial law.
[03:01:26.416 --> 03:01:29.777]  They now submit to me.
[03:01:29.777 --> 03:01:31.378]  You like that?
[03:01:31.378 --> 03:01:32.798]  Maybe I should host the next 45 minutes.
[03:01:34.660 --> 03:01:37.721]  As fentanyl.
[03:01:37.721 --> 03:01:44.924]  Do you guys want the next 50 minutes of broadcast for me to host as fentanyl?
[03:01:44.924 --> 03:01:45.844]  The Chinese dragon?
[03:01:45.844 --> 03:01:48.305]  Okay, you want it?
[03:01:48.305 --> 03:01:48.565]  Fine.
[03:01:50.282 --> 03:01:57.149]  Oh, WHO, your director says government should not be forcing lockdown.
[03:01:57.149 --> 03:02:00.172]  Oh, someone going to have accident.
[03:02:00.172 --> 03:02:02.354]  Article on site you not visit.
[03:02:02.354 --> 03:02:05.897]  Air Force One, thank you.
[03:02:05.897 --> 03:02:07.619]  Here video of traitor.
[03:02:12.282 --> 03:02:26.374]  We had Professor Sunetra Gupta from Oxford University on, and she was implying, and I'm mentioning you because you have a global mandate, a global view, was that a problem we don't think about in lockdowns is that they're very nationalistic.
[03:02:26.934 --> 03:02:30.837]  That if we lock down our economy, then it hits our economy.
[03:02:30.837 --> 03:02:33.018]  But it also means we are not buying stuff.
[03:02:33.018 --> 03:02:35.540]  We're not trading with weaker economies.
[03:02:35.540 --> 03:02:37.822]  We are not just destroying our own jobs.
[03:02:37.822 --> 03:02:42.465]  We're destroying the jobs of all those that in the poorer parts of the world that export to us.
[03:02:42.465 --> 03:02:43.326]  They die?
[03:02:43.326 --> 03:02:45.447]  That seems to me to be a reasonable point.
[03:02:45.447 --> 03:02:47.949]  Really important point by Professor Gupta.
[03:02:47.949 --> 03:02:48.830]  I want to say it again.
[03:02:49.785 --> 03:02:56.949]  We in the World Health Organization do not advocate lockdowns as a primary means of controlling this virus.
[03:02:56.949 --> 03:02:57.309]  Hit pause!
[03:02:57.309 --> 03:02:58.310]  Hit pause!
[03:02:58.310 --> 03:02:59.890]  Hit pause!
[03:02:59.890 --> 03:03:03.773]  You notice Alex Jones told you this for eight months.
[03:03:03.773 --> 03:03:07.615]  Now because they get blamed for that, they don't want you to think they did it.
[03:03:07.615 --> 03:03:08.975]  But we did it!
[03:03:08.975 --> 03:03:12.157]  Chinese Dragon did it!
[03:03:12.157 --> 03:03:12.697]  Awww!
[03:03:12.697 --> 03:03:13.818]  Back to the video!
[03:03:15.213 --> 03:03:16.554]  Oh, we didn't do it?
[03:03:16.554 --> 03:03:17.374]  Oh, it's an accident?
[03:03:17.374 --> 03:03:18.374]  We did not know what we did!
[03:03:43.866 --> 03:03:46.388]  The Rockefeller tell us how to do it.
[03:03:46.388 --> 03:03:48.769]  Look what's happening to poverty levels.
[03:03:48.769 --> 03:03:53.072]  We may well have a doubling of world poverty by next year.
[03:03:53.072 --> 03:04:02.458]  We may well have at least a doubling of child malnutrition because children are not getting meals at school and their parents and poor families are not able to afford it.
[03:04:02.458 --> 03:04:06.841]  It's a terrible, ghastly, global catastrophe actually.
[03:04:06.841 --> 03:04:09.843]  And so we need to work together as global leaders.
[03:04:10.143 --> 03:04:14.547]  The global tatasophy is locked down, you fools!
[03:04:14.547 --> 03:04:18.770]  China Open, you starve to death!
[03:04:18.770 --> 03:04:19.530]  Good job!
[03:04:19.530 --> 03:04:20.231]  Sorry.
[03:04:32.881 --> 03:04:34.322]  We're on full fentanyl now.
[03:04:34.322 --> 03:04:39.684]  You die Americans, friends like, you die Americans, Africans too!
[03:04:39.684 --> 03:04:42.905]  It's China's property, ha-oh-hoo!
[03:04:42.905 --> 03:04:46.087]  We told you to lock down, you starve to death!
[03:04:46.087 --> 03:04:49.248]  You scared of virus, but you starve to death!
[03:04:49.248 --> 03:04:51.449]  Starve America, starve Europe too!
[03:04:51.449 --> 03:04:53.490]  Kill the Africans, kill them all!
[03:05:02.034 --> 03:05:05.316]  Cha-ping-chong-wang-chong-pong-chong-yong!
[03:05:05.316 --> 03:05:08.257]  Pong-chong-wong-wong-dong-dong-dong!
[03:05:08.257 --> 03:05:11.339]  We fund the Antifa Maoist group!
[03:05:11.339 --> 03:05:12.540]  Ha-ha-ha-ha!
[03:05:12.540 --> 03:05:14.561]  We love Hillary too!
[03:05:14.561 --> 03:05:16.002]  It's so damn fun!
[03:05:16.002 --> 03:05:17.823]  You're so damn scared!
[03:05:17.823 --> 03:05:20.804]  Wear your mask and prepare to die!
[03:05:20.804 --> 03:05:23.146]  Chong-wong-chong-chong-pong-chong-yee!
[03:05:23.846 --> 03:05:26.707]  Dong, dong, long, bong, bong, geeky.
[03:05:26.707 --> 03:05:29.268]  We love LeBron James, he's so good.
[03:05:29.268 --> 03:05:32.709]  Death camps all kinds of students too.
[03:05:32.709 --> 03:05:38.572]  Kill the Muslims, kill the Christians, kill the Buddhists, liberals love us.
[03:05:38.572 --> 03:05:41.593]  Ping, chow, wong, chong, bing, dong, kong.
[03:05:41.593 --> 03:05:44.534]  Bong, dong, long, chong, tong, dot, ong.
[03:05:44.534 --> 03:05:47.515]  Bill Gates loves us, he does so good.
[03:05:47.515 --> 03:05:49.756]  Take our vaccines and die like you should.
[03:05:50.316 --> 03:05:53.420]  Take the shots and learn how to die!
[03:06:08.058 --> 03:06:08.478]  Die!
[03:06:08.478 --> 03:06:10.580]  Die, American scum!
[03:06:10.580 --> 03:06:13.462]  Ping-pow, ping-po, pong-cha-kong!
[03:06:13.462 --> 03:06:16.183]  Chong-chong, ching-pong, dong-ba-gong!
[03:06:16.183 --> 03:06:18.965]  We own your debt, your media too!
[03:06:18.965 --> 03:06:20.266]  Ha-ha-ha-ha!
[03:06:20.266 --> 03:06:21.747]  It's time to die!
[03:06:21.747 --> 03:06:24.449]  Take your shots, and roll your eyes!
[03:06:24.449 --> 03:06:27.151]  Live real good, wear your mask!
[03:06:27.151 --> 03:06:29.592]  I'm your Chinese Communist King!
[03:06:29.592 --> 03:06:32.474]  Pong-chong, wong-pong, ching-pa-kuang!
[03:06:32.474 --> 03:06:35.356]  Wong-chong, ping-kuang, pong-cha-kong!
[03:06:35.356 --> 03:06:37.758]  Wong-chong, king-kong, pong-cha-kuang!
[03:06:40.362 --> 03:06:46.746]  It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would track your GPS location.
[03:07:10.282 --> 03:07:10.822]  I think so.
[03:07:41.069 --> 03:07:50.215]  The Bible talks about there being ten kings of the earth that sit above the nation states and who give their power unto the one world leader, the Antichrist.
[03:07:50.215 --> 03:07:57.781]  And he has a beast system that no one can buy or sell unless he has that mark in the forehead or in the palm of their hand.
[03:07:57.781 --> 03:08:04.946]  And we look back on all the warnings that were given and all just the common sense that you don't believe in God.
[03:08:05.666 --> 03:08:07.027]  We're good to go.
[03:08:35.646 --> 03:08:37.489]  They're just rolling it out.
[03:08:37.489 --> 03:08:39.091]  And a lot of people are complying with it.
[03:08:39.091 --> 03:08:43.196]  It's insane.
[03:08:43.196 --> 03:08:45.799]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:59.702 --> 03:09:02.663]  Quit the inflammatory China bashing.
[03:09:25.780 --> 03:09:28.461]  Why do you keep calling this the Chinese virus?
[03:09:28.461 --> 03:09:34.583]  There are reports of dozens of incidents of bias against Chinese Americans in this country.
[03:09:34.583 --> 03:09:38.245]  Your own aide, Secretary Azar, says he does not use this term.
[03:09:38.245 --> 03:09:41.226]  He says ethnicity does not cause the virus.
[03:09:41.226 --> 03:09:42.486]  Why do you keep using that?
[03:09:42.486 --> 03:09:43.507]  Because it comes from China.
[03:09:43.507 --> 03:09:44.947]  A lot of people say it's racist.
[03:09:44.947 --> 03:09:45.788]  It's not racist at all.
[03:09:45.788 --> 03:09:46.668]  Not at all.
[03:09:46.668 --> 03:09:48.008]  It comes from China.
[03:09:48.008 --> 03:09:48.489]  Batman.
[03:09:48.489 --> 03:09:50.609]  Did this virus originate in China?
[03:09:50.609 --> 03:09:51.170]  Good man.
[03:09:52.944 --> 03:10:00.151]  But Mr. President, that does not excuse your weeks and weeks of tweeting lies and misinformation about the virus.
[03:10:00.151 --> 03:10:06.857]  There are some, at least one White House official who used the term Kung Flu, referring to the fact that this virus started in China.
[03:10:06.857 --> 03:10:07.778]  Is that acceptable?
[03:10:07.778 --> 03:10:08.339]  Is it wrong?
[03:10:08.339 --> 03:10:14.765]  Are you worried that having this virus be talked about as a Chinese virus, that that might be the Kung Flu?
[03:10:14.765 --> 03:10:15.545]  Say the term again.
[03:10:17.094 --> 03:10:20.377]  A person at the White House, he used the term kung flu.
[03:10:20.377 --> 03:10:22.419]  My question is, do you think that's wrong?
[03:10:22.419 --> 03:10:23.721]  Kung flu.
[03:10:23.721 --> 03:10:25.863]  Now your media working for us.
[03:10:25.863 --> 03:10:29.728]  Say your economy is crashing and your president do that job.
[03:10:29.728 --> 03:10:32.671]  But they praise our leader, Xi Jinping.
[03:10:42.258 --> 03:10:46.301]  That translates to, hope you enjoy your depression.
[03:10:46.301 --> 03:10:51.686]  Our people in your media and senate say you'll be shut down for 18 months.
[03:10:51.686 --> 03:10:53.247]  We're back and running.
[03:10:53.247 --> 03:11:01.854]  And your senate under Schumer and others like Feinstein, who work for us, will not give you aid package.
[03:11:01.854 --> 03:11:04.176]  You see, you are our slaves.
[03:11:04.176 --> 03:11:07.418]  We owe you a debt, and now we send virus to kill you.
[03:11:08.619 --> 03:11:21.169]  We could not do this without Hollywood that we own, and without all the fentanyl you take, and the fact that the media works against you because we, again, control them.
[03:11:21.169 --> 03:11:31.677]  So, soon Trump will be gone, and you will be homeless, on the continent your forebears conquered.
[03:11:31.677 --> 03:11:31.817]  Ha!
[03:11:31.817 --> 03:11:33.539]  This message is not approved by Tim Cook.
[03:11:34.795 --> 03:11:37.057]  I just caught you, American!
[03:11:37.057 --> 03:11:39.799]  You visited Bandar Video!
[03:11:39.799 --> 03:11:43.322]  Oh, Mark Zuckerberg and all is angry at you!
[03:11:43.322 --> 03:11:52.469]  Do what CNN says and do not visit Bandar Video, or I have to hurt you!
[03:11:52.469 --> 03:11:55.972]  Fentanyl is incredibly sexy.
[03:11:55.972 --> 03:11:59.555]  They say fentanyl is like the actual sex symbol of China.
[03:11:59.555 --> 03:12:01.857]  I'm not really gay, but I think it's a male dragon.
[03:12:01.857 --> 03:12:02.798]  I kind of like that dragon.
[03:12:05.230 --> 03:12:10.393]  You know, we have footage of Trump dancing around last night saying, I feel so good, I could go kiss guys, I could go kiss some beautiful women.
[03:12:10.393 --> 03:12:15.255]  He's trolling the media, but they're not telling evangelicals you better not vote for Trump.
[03:12:15.255 --> 03:12:17.356]  He'll play the video in a minute with audio.
[03:12:17.356 --> 03:12:21.538]  It's called trolling them, like when I joke around like that.
[03:12:21.538 --> 03:12:24.500]  I was on the Drinkin' Bros podcast a few days ago.
[03:12:24.500 --> 03:12:26.100]  It's another video out there.
[03:12:26.100 --> 03:12:26.721]  It's a good interview.
[03:12:27.660 --> 03:12:30.302]  And, uh, I went and sat in a guy's lap.
[03:12:30.302 --> 03:12:34.585]  It was a joke I wasn't actually trying to get picked up by.
[03:12:34.585 --> 03:12:38.248]  It's called humor.
[03:12:38.248 --> 03:12:43.071]  But when the left tries to teach your five-year-olds how to give a blowjob, that's not a good thing.
[03:12:43.071 --> 03:12:44.933]  See, the left wants to act like we don't have humor.
[03:12:44.933 --> 03:12:46.834]  They're the ones that don't have humor.
[03:12:46.834 --> 03:12:50.037]  They're the ones that can't deal with all of this.
[03:12:50.037 --> 03:12:52.278]  There it is, Drinking Bros Podcast, Alex Jones.
[03:12:52.278 --> 03:12:55.841]  Let's just say they had the villain from Halloween in studio, and I dominated it.
[03:12:59.742 --> 03:13:02.745]  By the way, people have been asking when I'm going to go on Joe Rogan.
[03:13:02.745 --> 03:13:03.486]  The answer is never.
[03:13:03.486 --> 03:13:11.092]  It's never going to happen.
[03:13:11.092 --> 03:13:14.315]  It's never going to happen in the next few days.
[03:13:14.315 --> 03:13:17.858]  All right, you know, Paul Joseph Watson was supposed to be here.
[03:13:17.858 --> 03:13:20.020]  And I can more than easily fill this hour.
[03:13:20.020 --> 03:13:22.542]  You know how easy I can do it?
[03:13:22.542 --> 03:13:26.466]  Paul called us earlier, he goes, about an hour ago, he goes, I've got a power outage.
[03:13:27.867 --> 03:13:30.720]  And it doesn't look like it'll be turned on anytime soon.
[03:13:30.720 --> 03:13:32.407]  That's like the dog ate my homework.
[03:13:34.633 --> 03:13:39.515]  The power's out, but I've got this incredibly hot chick in my house right now.
[03:13:39.515 --> 03:13:42.076]  He just said, I got this super hot chick at my house.
[03:13:42.076 --> 03:13:47.119]  We all know that's what Paul misses the show at the time is his dalliances, which is fine.
[03:13:47.119 --> 03:13:54.582]  But instead of like just saying, hey, I got this super hot Brazilian chick at my house or whatever, he calls in and says, oh, I'm sorry.
[03:13:54.582 --> 03:14:00.525]  I need time to get the power on, but it doesn't look like the power will be turning on anytime this year.
[03:14:03.592 --> 03:14:07.334]  But see, that's the thing about communication and about human communion.
[03:14:07.334 --> 03:14:09.736]  We want to work with Paul.
[03:14:09.736 --> 03:14:10.997]  We like Paul.
[03:14:10.997 --> 03:14:13.458]  We don't need Paul.
[03:14:13.458 --> 03:14:16.580]  It's kind of like being in the village and like, you know, half the houses are empty.
[03:14:16.580 --> 03:14:22.965]  We want to promote characters that are good people, that we like, that are independent, free folks.
[03:14:22.965 --> 03:14:28.768]  Paul Joseph Watson actually joined Fentanyl today.
[03:14:28.768 --> 03:14:29.629]  He married Fentanyl.
[03:14:31.718 --> 03:14:33.158]  Which is a codename for ZZ Pink.
[03:14:33.158 --> 03:14:44.421]  Paul Joseph Watson, I have to report to you, has been part of a gay marriage with Fentanyl the Dragon, and has now married him.
[03:14:44.421 --> 03:14:46.782]  He told me, he said, if you air that Fentanyl video, it's over.
[03:14:46.782 --> 03:14:56.304]  Alright, I'll let the secret out, this is...
[03:14:58.339 --> 03:14:59.440]  This is a big day here.
[03:14:59.440 --> 03:15:02.202]  I'm going to tell you, Q is actually G.G.
[03:15:02.202 --> 03:15:03.864]  Pink.
[03:15:03.864 --> 03:15:05.065]  And Paul is married to G.G.
[03:15:05.065 --> 03:15:05.585]  Pink.
[03:15:05.585 --> 03:15:12.531]  Paul is married to Q. And I'm just going to be honest with you, I suited, I courted G.G.
[03:15:12.531 --> 03:15:15.934]  Pink for more than 20 years.
[03:15:15.934 --> 03:15:20.919]  And so did Bill Gates, so did David Rockefeller, so did Bill Clinton, so did Barack Obama.
[03:15:20.919 --> 03:15:25.563]  Everyone wanted to be with the dragon, to mate with the dragon, to be mounted by the dragon.
[03:15:28.510 --> 03:15:30.591]  We all failed except Paul Watson.
[03:15:30.591 --> 03:15:34.734]  Paul Watson is actually married to Xi Jinping.
[03:15:34.734 --> 03:15:39.097]  And the best man for Xi Jinping and his bride, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:15:39.097 --> 03:15:40.818]  Paul is the girl.
[03:15:40.818 --> 03:15:44.200]  Paul is the bottom, I guess, they call that.
[03:15:44.200 --> 03:15:57.809]  The point is that Bill Gates was the ring bearer at this event where Paul Joseph Watson was married as the bride to Xi Jinping.
[03:15:58.854 --> 03:16:00.095]  So Paul won't be here anymore.
[03:16:00.095 --> 03:16:01.095]  You'll never hear Paul again.
[03:16:01.095 --> 03:16:03.136]  Not Summit.News, not even.
[03:16:03.136 --> 03:16:06.417]  He now... Yeah.
[03:16:06.417 --> 03:16:08.238]  No, it's true.
[03:16:08.238 --> 03:16:09.879]  Listen, I can't lie to the audience.
[03:16:09.879 --> 03:16:12.020]  I'm going to be honest with you about this.
[03:16:12.020 --> 03:16:16.022]  He told me years ago, he said, listen, I'm at a love affair with Jeezy Ping.
[03:16:16.022 --> 03:16:18.083]  Also knows the Dragon.
[03:16:18.083 --> 03:16:20.244]  Reasons I won't mention here.
[03:16:20.244 --> 03:16:23.345]  It's too graphic, but it's too powerful.
[03:16:23.345 --> 03:16:24.446]  Makes me start salivating.
[03:16:25.404 --> 03:16:30.605]  Just to think about, let me tell you, like, you've heard of, like, higher levels of consciousness?
[03:16:30.605 --> 03:16:51.290]  Xi Jinping's, like, way up there, like, not as high as Q, but, like, almost as high, like, you, you, you hit the ceiling, gotta bounce off the ceiling, and when you bounce a little above the ceiling, you go, oh, oh, Xi Jinping, oh, you know, like, oh, Q, oh, Q, oh, and then he goes, oh, oh, Ning Zhang, Wang Zhang, Ning Zhang, Wang Bang.
[03:16:52.230 --> 03:16:58.214]  All right, this has been a true mission into insanity.
[03:16:58.214 --> 03:17:01.135]  But before the New York Times calls, it's satire.
[03:17:01.135 --> 03:17:05.238]  Paul Joseph Watson is not dating Xi Jinping.
[03:17:05.238 --> 03:17:08.780]  Paul Joseph Watson is not dating David Rockefeller.
[03:17:08.780 --> 03:17:16.865]  Paul Joseph Watson is not dating Karl Rove.
[03:17:16.865 --> 03:17:18.506]  I am.
[03:17:18.506 --> 03:17:21.788]  I've had a relationship for more than 20 years with Karl Rove as his sex slave.
[03:17:23.095 --> 03:17:27.981]  And he lives by me and I go and I call him, he's my master.
[03:17:27.981 --> 03:17:32.085]  See, I'm like seeing it, I'm like, none of that's true by the way, it's all satire.
[03:17:32.085 --> 03:17:37.792]  But I'm like, I'm like literally just channeling, oh there's an actual photo, okay.
[03:17:39.292 --> 03:17:49.902]  In fiction, supervillains are known as supervillains because they have gigantic, huge, global plans that are incredibly well thought out and incredibly complex.
[03:17:49.902 --> 03:17:55.067]  And they might have told you a year ago, back in October of 2019, that a powerful billionaire
[03:17:55.407 --> 03:17:56.548]  You tell me that's crazy.
[03:17:56.548 --> 03:17:58.830]  You tell me that's a dystopia.
[03:17:58.830 --> 03:18:01.193]  You tell me that's some type of science fiction comic book.
[03:18:20.291 --> 03:18:22.253]  But in reality, it really did happen.
[03:18:22.253 --> 03:18:30.782]  His name is Bill Gates, and he's the head of a major eugenics consortium that his father and mother set up more than 60 years ago.
[03:18:30.782 --> 03:18:33.345]  And we're living in this world Bill Gates has built.
[03:18:33.345 --> 03:18:36.108]  Until we start saying no, we are Bill Gates's property.
[03:18:36.108 --> 03:18:37.430]  It's time to expose Bill Gates.
[03:18:38.956 --> 03:18:45.479]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much less in the entire world.
[03:18:45.479 --> 03:18:51.502]  Infowars is standalone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks and hundreds of stations picking us up.
[03:18:51.502 --> 03:19:01.948]  Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering real issues of global populism, the right to self-defense, and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda.
[03:19:02.728 --> 03:19:06.952]  That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at Band.Video.
[03:19:06.952 --> 03:19:11.416]  They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook.
[03:19:11.416 --> 03:19:19.823]  That's why it's so precious, because the censorship expands to everyone, which it is now, with AI monitoring and controlling what you can say and do.
[03:19:19.823 --> 03:19:26.750]  It's going to be the OACs like Band.Video and the now redesigned Infowars.com that become more and more important, which they are.
[03:19:27.170 --> 03:19:34.885]  And the enemy is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating us, trying to shut us down right now.
[03:19:34.885 --> 03:19:36.648]  Because they're coming after everyone.
[03:19:36.648 --> 03:19:37.590]  So spread the word now.
[03:19:38.661 --> 03:19:41.843]  The future isn't coming, it's here.
[03:19:41.843 --> 03:19:50.408]  And in the future, keeping your humanity, saving your soul, your integrity, your very essence, is going to be your most valuable asset.
[03:19:50.408 --> 03:19:53.990]  In fact, it's going to be your only asset.
[03:19:53.990 --> 03:20:06.698]  The world being built by the technocrats, and the trap they've now sprung with COVID-19 and the endless lockdown, is the beginning of the process of taking us past domestication into total
[03:20:07.878 --> 03:20:10.459]  Incomplete dehumanization.
[03:20:10.459 --> 03:20:16.560]  Human life will be impossible to be carried out in an original biological way by the year 2050.
[03:20:16.560 --> 03:20:19.421]  This is their stated goal.
[03:20:19.421 --> 03:20:29.204]  I'm sorry to have to report horrifying things like this to you, but only by facing the horror and not projecting your own decency onto the enemy.
[03:20:29.204 --> 03:20:29.944]  We turn this around.
[03:20:30.684 --> 03:20:32.807]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:20:52.631 --> 03:20:54.512]  The truth is out.
[03:20:54.512 --> 03:20:59.973]  Jones is a sexual consort of GG King, known as Dragon Weenie.
[03:20:59.973 --> 03:21:06.915]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:21:06.915 --> 03:21:09.816]  And now, the Dragon Weenie Conspiracy.
[03:21:09.816 --> 03:21:15.378]  You... You have... You have me.
[03:21:15.378 --> 03:21:15.998]  What that means?
[03:21:15.998 --> 03:21:17.458]  It means you got me.
[03:21:17.458 --> 03:21:21.960]  You... You have... You have me.
[03:21:25.487 --> 03:21:27.109]  Alright, I should have taken calls today.
[03:21:27.109 --> 03:21:28.109]  I would have taken calls.
[03:21:28.109 --> 03:21:28.950]  I knew I had this hour.
[03:21:28.950 --> 03:21:31.132]  Paul Watson was supposed to be here.
[03:21:31.132 --> 03:21:35.255]  The power went out and he won't be back for days.
[03:21:35.255 --> 03:21:37.257]  That means he's literally what he's using right now.
[03:21:37.257 --> 03:21:39.779]  Turn the spot up brighter.
[03:21:39.779 --> 03:21:40.900]  Ms.
[03:21:40.900 --> 03:21:42.942]  Bruce, turn it up!
[03:21:42.942 --> 03:21:44.083]  You guys can't turn the music up?
[03:21:44.083 --> 03:21:49.867]  Okay.
[03:21:49.867 --> 03:21:50.748]  Paul sold us out.
[03:21:50.748 --> 03:21:51.589]  Look at that footage.
[03:21:54.156 --> 03:22:00.598]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:22:00.598 --> 03:22:01.698]  Look at Watson.
[03:22:01.698 --> 03:22:03.138]  Unbelievable.
[03:22:03.138 --> 03:22:05.299]  Total proof.
[03:22:05.299 --> 03:22:07.920]  Du hast mich.
[03:22:07.920 --> 03:22:08.920]  Du hast mich.
[03:22:20.788 --> 03:22:23.750]  I love how they turn everything on the show into a conspiracy theory.
[03:22:23.750 --> 03:22:47.826]  We have a real human skull, and a broadsword, and then a white eagle... Roman-style... symbol.
[03:22:47.826 --> 03:22:50.468]  What do they call that in Rome, where you have the symbol of the eagle?
[03:22:55.282 --> 03:22:59.524]  What do they call that?
[03:22:59.524 --> 03:23:00.344]  No, we have a name for it.
[03:23:00.344 --> 03:23:03.606]  We'll just sit here for hours if need be.
[03:23:03.606 --> 03:23:11.969]  That makes better radio anyways than covering facts and info like Bill Gates coming out saying, we're gonna do forced inoculations, everybody, world government, the lockdown's permanent.
[03:23:11.969 --> 03:23:15.191]  It's not a Roman signet.
[03:23:15.191 --> 03:23:16.131]  It's not the Aquila.
[03:23:18.632 --> 03:23:19.712]  The standard.
[03:23:19.712 --> 03:23:20.913]  It's the Roman standard.
[03:23:20.913 --> 03:23:22.013]  There you go.
[03:23:22.013 --> 03:23:32.217]  So, we're here with a white eagle Roman standard with a real skull and a broad-edged sword.
[03:23:32.217 --> 03:23:33.918]  What does that symbolize?
[03:23:33.918 --> 03:23:35.078]  Well, it's esoteric.
[03:23:35.078 --> 03:23:36.979]  You project onto it what you think.
[03:23:36.979 --> 03:23:38.080]  Here, give me a shot of it.
[03:23:38.080 --> 03:23:40.521]  I'll tell you what I see.
[03:23:40.521 --> 03:23:46.643]  I see the symbol of death that is transcendent by our spirit.
[03:23:48.643 --> 03:23:59.467]  But the fact of the sword of truth is the only thing that will make us be transcendent, and the little dagger of death is but a pinprick in the rest of the universe.
[03:24:01.769 --> 03:24:03.530]  But I'm done talking about that right now.
[03:24:03.530 --> 03:24:19.338]  CDC admits 65, excuse me, CDC admits 85, 85, 85, 85, 85, like in 1985, of COVID-infected, always or often wore their mask.
[03:24:19.338 --> 03:24:30.143]  So the little face die piece... ...do not protect you.
[03:24:30.143 --> 03:24:31.384]  By the way, you know what about plagiarism?
[03:24:40.540 --> 03:24:42.780]  That is what, oh, people are listening now.
[03:24:42.780 --> 03:24:45.421]  That's what Rush Limbaugh used to do.
[03:24:45.421 --> 03:24:49.462]  I was a senior in high school, and I'd go out to lunch with my girlfriend, and I'd be drowsy.
[03:24:49.462 --> 03:24:50.242]  Why are you listening to that guy?
[03:24:50.242 --> 03:24:51.262]  I'd be like, well, he does this.
[03:24:51.262 --> 03:25:00.344]  Excuse me?
[03:25:00.344 --> 03:25:02.204]  Formerly nicotine stained fingers.
[03:25:15.595 --> 03:25:17.717]  You know, you've heard of radio.
[03:25:17.717 --> 03:25:22.180]  You've heard of, like, white noise or, like, rain sounds for three hours.
[03:25:22.180 --> 03:25:26.164]  What if I put a YouTube out of, like, Rush Limbaugh crackling paper for three hours?
[03:25:26.164 --> 03:25:39.895]  Just like... Yeah, they have footage where, like, girls eat, like, KFC, like... Like, for hours.
[03:25:39.895 --> 03:25:40.516]  What if we just have this...
[03:25:56.482 --> 03:25:56.742]  All right.
[03:25:56.742 --> 03:25:58.964]  I appreciate our radio stations and TV stations.
[03:25:58.964 --> 03:25:59.865]  I'm going to stop.
[03:25:59.865 --> 03:26:04.268]  I'm going to stop misbehaving.
[03:26:04.268 --> 03:26:06.670]  But maybe I'm cracking up on air.
[03:26:06.670 --> 03:26:10.412]  Maybe I'm going to end up in a lunatic asylum soon.
[03:26:10.412 --> 03:26:13.895]  Maybe I'll be locked up with Joe Biden.
[03:26:13.895 --> 03:26:16.477]  I mean, Joe Biden, that's an incredible picture you just drew.
[03:26:16.477 --> 03:26:17.458]  Why is it all in brown?
[03:26:17.458 --> 03:26:23.502]  I didn't realize he's like, you know, drawing it in his own excrement.
[03:26:23.502 --> 03:26:25.644]  Paul doesn't realize that the longer he doesn't show up for the show,
[03:26:27.671 --> 03:26:30.793]  Here, let's just call Paul Watson right now.
[03:26:30.793 --> 03:26:31.453]  Let's just do this.
[03:26:31.453 --> 03:26:36.496]  Here we go.
[03:26:36.496 --> 03:26:38.297]  See if he answers.
[03:26:38.297 --> 03:26:40.438]  Welcome to the EE voicemail.
[03:26:40.438 --> 03:26:43.600]  I'm sorry, but the person you've called is not available.
[03:26:43.600 --> 03:26:46.022]  Please leave your message after the tone.
[03:26:46.022 --> 03:26:53.186]  So it sounds to me like, it sounds to me like there's not just a power outage.
[03:26:54.525 --> 03:26:57.286]  The light got clicked off up in that little chateau tonight.
[03:26:57.286 --> 03:27:01.527]  Up in that little bordure.
[03:27:01.527 --> 03:27:06.249]  GG Ping is with his quarry right now.
[03:27:06.249 --> 03:27:12.230]  Folks, I have to heavy-hearted admit to you that Paul is dating GG Ping.
[03:27:12.230 --> 03:27:13.611]  I mean, you've seen the proof!
[03:27:13.611 --> 03:27:14.851]  Alright, I'm joking.
[03:27:14.851 --> 03:27:15.971]  I'm gonna stop right now.
[03:27:15.971 --> 03:27:18.672]  This is unprofessional.
[03:27:18.672 --> 03:27:20.713]  And I'm gonna go to break.
[03:27:20.713 --> 03:27:24.074]  When I come back, I'm gonna do a serious final 10 minutes of this show.
[03:27:27.594 --> 03:27:29.715]  You guys want to have a guarantee of that?
[03:27:29.715 --> 03:27:31.357]  All right, let's get serious then.
[03:27:31.357 --> 03:27:36.660]  I have a lot of important things to cover.
[03:27:36.660 --> 03:27:42.224]  Let's go out to break with Jeffrey Epstein's Temple has moved to Los Angeles to find work.
[03:27:42.224 --> 03:27:49.128]  Tim Dillon, a good friend of the show, now a fellow Austinite, now Joe Rogan's new favorite person.
[03:27:49.128 --> 03:27:56.934]  Let's go to Tim Dillon, who is now advertising himself as Jeffrey Epstein's Satanic Temple, trying to get a job in Los Angeles.
[03:27:56.934 --> 03:27:57.234]  Here it is.
[03:28:08.041 --> 03:28:11.782]  As a sacrifice temple, there's not a lot of cities you can work.
[03:28:11.782 --> 03:28:14.683]  This is one of the only cities.
[03:28:14.683 --> 03:28:20.445]  You know, the problem is a lot of these people already have sacrifice temples they've been using for years.
[03:28:20.445 --> 03:28:22.805]  So to break into it at this point is very hard.
[03:28:22.805 --> 03:28:24.306]  You act like you don't remember me.
[03:28:24.306 --> 03:28:25.226]  I remember you.
[03:28:25.226 --> 03:28:28.227]  Last July we had a lot of fun.
[03:28:28.227 --> 03:28:28.807]  Come on!
[03:28:30.100 --> 03:28:31.741]  He knows!
[03:28:31.741 --> 03:28:33.921]  So I'm also trying to get into entertainment.
[03:28:33.921 --> 03:28:35.302]  I'm trying to do that.
[03:28:35.302 --> 03:28:40.243]  Has anybody else's boss also killed themself?
[03:28:40.243 --> 03:28:42.424]  It's like f*** here, you know?
[03:28:42.424 --> 03:28:44.704]  Listen, I mean, this is like the next phase of my life.
[03:28:44.704 --> 03:28:46.825]  I didn't expect this to happen.
[03:28:46.825 --> 03:28:50.606]  I thought I would work until retirement, but now I'm f***ing out.
[03:28:50.606 --> 03:28:53.507]  I'm out here in LA trying to break into entertainment.
[03:28:53.507 --> 03:28:54.447]  This is my dream.
[03:28:57.248 --> 03:28:59.850]  I always wanted to be a stand-up comedian.
[03:28:59.850 --> 03:29:05.954]  Even when Hillary Clinton was slicing the throats of children, I said, I just want to make people laugh.
[03:29:05.954 --> 03:29:07.795]  My owner is dead.
[03:29:07.795 --> 03:29:08.375]  Ish.
[03:29:08.375 --> 03:29:10.096]  Wherever he f*** is.
[03:29:10.096 --> 03:29:12.097]  He's not using me anymore.
[03:29:12.097 --> 03:29:17.560]  You know, I was, the other day I was out and I saw the Scientology Celebrity Center and this f***er didn't even say hello to me.
[03:29:17.560 --> 03:29:19.681]  Bitch, you know who I am.
[03:29:19.681 --> 03:29:21.863]  You f***ing know who I am.
[03:29:21.863 --> 03:29:25.025]  I've had just as many celebrities inside of me as you.
[03:29:25.025 --> 03:29:25.045]  K?
[03:29:26.684 --> 03:29:29.485]  I'm like a bouncy castle for satanic pedophiles.
[03:29:29.485 --> 03:29:29.785]  You know?
[03:29:29.785 --> 03:29:32.605]  That's not all I want to be.
[03:29:32.605 --> 03:29:33.465]  Finally just got headshots.
[03:29:54.969 --> 03:29:59.790]  Meeting with a manager, don't know how it's gonna work, don't expect anything.
[03:29:59.790 --> 03:30:01.611]  Somebody told me to start a podcast.
[03:30:01.611 --> 03:30:04.951]  I mean, I guess it's not a bad idea.
[03:30:04.951 --> 03:30:10.072]  But, this is where it's at now, you know?
[03:30:10.072 --> 03:30:14.853]  Jeffrey used to look at me, he used to say, one day I'm gonna be gone, it's gonna be different.
[03:30:14.853 --> 03:30:15.854]  And you know what?
[03:30:15.854 --> 03:30:18.974]  He was right.
[03:30:18.974 --> 03:30:21.435]  By the way, Tim Dillon is Joe Rogan's favorite comedian.
[03:30:22.441 --> 03:30:28.268]  And they also have gotten married recently and bought a house together in Austin.
[03:30:28.268 --> 03:30:29.190]  Which part of that is true?
[03:30:29.190 --> 03:30:32.714]  The first part, the last part, or all of it?
[03:30:32.714 --> 03:30:34.556]  Well, CMM can only tell you the truth.
[03:30:34.556 --> 03:30:35.417]  I don't know.
[03:30:35.417 --> 03:30:35.698]  Say what?
[03:30:38.322 --> 03:30:49.929]  You notice that over and over again, the United Nations, our supposed controllers and bosses, the great arbiter of truth that no one's allowed to disagree with, has come out and said, nothing can treat or prevent COVID-19.
[03:30:49.929 --> 03:30:52.891]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that's a total lie.
[03:30:52.891 --> 03:31:03.577]  If you get a lot of sunlight, it's on record to produce a ton of vitamin D3, and it's almost impossible to get viral infections when you're getting plenty of vitamin D3, if you have zinc and vitamin C as well.
[03:31:03.857 --> 03:31:09.041]  That's why people get the flus and these colds in the winter because that's when vitamin D levels plunge.
[03:31:09.041 --> 03:31:16.966]  Now I've pointed this out and the media has called me a scammer for saying that there's hope and that people should have their vitamins and their minerals.
[03:31:16.966 --> 03:31:22.790]  Well now Fauci's been forced to come out and admit that you need vitamin D3 and C. He should have also added
[03:31:22.790 --> 03:31:23.151]  That's right.
[03:31:37.145 --> 03:31:42.670]  This is your last chance to get a pack power stack, and I'm really bummed out about that.
[03:31:42.670 --> 03:31:47.814]  It started out as a sleeper product, but the people that did order it loved it and started reordering it.
[03:31:47.814 --> 03:31:50.156]  They spread the word and became one of our best sellers.
[03:31:50.156 --> 03:31:52.738]  But because of the COVID supply chain breakdown,
[03:31:53.118 --> 03:31:59.285]  Because there's 13 different formulas in a pack power stack, we are unable to secure it anymore.
[03:31:59.285 --> 03:32:07.915]  This is the highest in AM-PM pack system you're going to find, where you take half the pills in the morning, half the tablets and pills and gel caps at night.
[03:32:07.915 --> 03:32:08.396]  It's amazing.
[03:32:08.396 --> 03:32:12.681]  I don't have time to go into everything that's in it, but this gets people to remember to take it.
[03:32:12.921 --> 03:32:16.804]  And that's why it's having such a great effect, because the stuff in here is absolutely amazing.

[03:32:43.674 --> 03:32:47.397]  Is your city too safe?
[03:32:47.397 --> 03:32:49.159]  Well, not anymore!
[03:32:49.159 --> 03:32:51.542]  Introducing... Democrats!
[03:32:51.542 --> 03:32:55.826]  Politicians so incompetent, they'll fill your neighborhood with riots!
[03:32:55.826 --> 03:32:56.167]  Looting!
[03:32:57.265 --> 03:33:00.489]  Rampant violence and even homelessness.
[03:33:00.489 --> 03:33:05.515]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old-fashioned stupidity.
[03:33:05.515 --> 03:33:07.897]  No more pesky law and order.
[03:33:07.897 --> 03:33:11.561]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[03:33:11.561 --> 03:33:16.166]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back, and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[03:33:16.927 --> 03:33:17.909]  But wait!
[03:33:17.909 --> 03:33:26.780]  Vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes, and more taxes!
[03:33:26.780 --> 03:33:29.824]  Democrats, bringing chaos right to your front door!

[03:34:07.219 --> 03:34:07.739]  The system
[03:34:08.699 --> 03:34:13.443]  Trump is censoring because the power of the people overrode them four years ago.
[03:34:13.443 --> 03:34:19.788]  Trump has finally figured this out and says he's going to take action once re-elected against Big Tech and that he's moderating the situation.
[03:34:19.788 --> 03:34:24.231]  Well, we know the president's overwhelmed right now, so we're going to sit here and cry because he has to take an action.
[03:34:24.231 --> 03:34:35.079]  We the people are taking action now, and you can do it very, very easily by sharing 2020ElectionsCenter.com, 2020ElectionsCenter.com, and checking out the new, redesigned InfoWars.com and sharing that link.
[03:34:35.079 --> 03:34:36.941]  Oh, that really upsets them, oh yeah!
[03:34:40.740 --> 03:34:56.869]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:56.869 --> 03:35:00.692]  The West is the best.
[03:35:00.692 --> 03:35:06.055]  The West is the best.
[03:35:06.055 --> 03:35:08.396]  The West is the best.
[03:35:08.396 --> 03:35:09.777]  That'll do the rest.
[03:35:12.048 --> 03:35:21.152]  The blue bus is calling us.
[03:35:21.152 --> 03:35:23.753]  Alright, let me get serious.
[03:35:23.753 --> 03:35:29.375]  You know when you're not scared of dying, when all you care about is freedom, you get a little wild on there.
[03:35:29.375 --> 03:35:30.915]  And I apologize for the last 45 minutes.
[03:35:30.915 --> 03:35:33.256]  I didn't know Paul Watson wouldn't be here.
[03:35:33.256 --> 03:35:36.558]  And I've really had a lot of good things happening, a lot of bad things happening behind the scenes.
[03:35:37.461 --> 03:35:39.123]  It's like the heavens have opened up.
[03:35:39.123 --> 03:35:46.229]  Just, it's incredible to be alive and know God is so real and be so thankful for all of you out there and this great crew.
[03:35:46.229 --> 03:35:47.210]  But I want to go wild.
[03:35:47.210 --> 03:35:48.170]  I want to have some fun.
[03:35:48.170 --> 03:35:49.792]  I'm sick and tired of the fight, man.
[03:35:49.792 --> 03:35:52.254]  Because I'm so into the fight.
[03:35:52.254 --> 03:35:52.694]  You know what I mean?
[03:35:52.694 --> 03:35:55.877]  It's like, for everything there's an opposite.
[03:35:55.877 --> 03:35:57.879]  For every action there's an opposite equal reaction.
[03:35:57.879 --> 03:36:00.361]  So, I'm this good guy.
[03:36:00.361 --> 03:36:01.582]  You're a good person too.
[03:36:01.582 --> 03:36:02.183]  We love God.
[03:36:02.183 --> 03:36:02.943]  We love justice.
[03:36:02.943 --> 03:36:03.284]  But man,
[03:36:04.994 --> 03:36:10.415]  The bigger my good side gets, the more I tell you that bad side is just sitting over there ready to go crazy.
[03:36:10.415 --> 03:36:18.457]  I've got a lot to cover here today.
[03:36:18.457 --> 03:36:19.377]  I talked about Tim Dillon.
[03:36:19.377 --> 03:36:21.118]  You know who Tim Dillon was like five years ago?
[03:36:21.118 --> 03:36:22.498]  I've seen his stuff.
[03:36:22.498 --> 03:36:23.358]  Really funny.
[03:36:23.358 --> 03:36:25.339]  And I talk to Joe Rogan quite a bit.
[03:36:25.339 --> 03:36:26.039]  Not name dropping.
[03:36:26.039 --> 03:36:27.339]  People keep asking when I'm going to be on the show.
[03:36:27.339 --> 03:36:30.480]  I'll just say, hold your breath.
[03:36:30.480 --> 03:36:31.600]  You won't be waiting too long.
[03:36:35.438 --> 03:36:39.740]  Then I went on this jag watching his stuff a lot because he's moving to Austin.
[03:36:39.740 --> 03:36:40.881]  This is a really funny guy.
[03:36:40.881 --> 03:36:48.466]  So here's his piece on Antifa and the Hamptons with another billionaire that's now organizing him to attack anybody that's got more money than him.
[03:36:48.466 --> 03:36:50.227]  That's really what the message is.
[03:36:50.227 --> 03:36:51.167]  But it's even worse than that.
[03:36:51.167 --> 03:36:52.848]  It's the elites attacking us.
[03:36:52.848 --> 03:36:57.891]  And then he's got this little satanic piece about a Democrat senator that are just very powerful.
[03:36:57.891 --> 03:37:00.032]  He did all this in the last few weeks.
[03:37:00.032 --> 03:37:01.133]  So here's a few of those pieces.
[03:37:02.520 --> 03:37:09.423]  You have the honor of being the first chapter of Antifa in the Hamptons.
[03:37:09.423 --> 03:37:11.244]  Why am I the leader?
[03:37:11.244 --> 03:37:15.967]  Because I am in the system, but I have defected, and now I agree with you.
[03:37:15.967 --> 03:37:20.129]  We are going to topple the patriarchy, and what is the patriarchy?
[03:37:20.669 --> 03:37:21.730]  Jeff Goldstein!
[03:37:21.730 --> 03:37:23.673]  Jeff Goldstein is my ex-wife.
[03:37:23.673 --> 03:37:24.353]  Correct!
[03:37:24.353 --> 03:37:27.077]  We're going to dismantle capitalism.
[03:37:27.077 --> 03:37:30.000]  And what is capitalism?
[03:37:30.000 --> 03:37:32.403]  Any hedge fund that's bigger than yours.
[03:37:32.403 --> 03:37:34.505]  Any hedge fund bigger than mine, correct.
[03:37:34.505 --> 03:37:37.829]  I have heard that certain people at the IRS
[03:37:38.590 --> 03:37:39.711]  You're trying to f**k?
[03:38:01.113 --> 03:38:03.254]  Ex-wife, is that what you're doing?
[03:38:03.254 --> 03:38:04.954]  You're trying to destroy a family?
[03:38:04.954 --> 03:38:11.556]  You will train day and night on the giraffe until you are ready for hand-to-hand combat.
[03:38:11.556 --> 03:38:17.017]  My commitment to social justice is unparalleled.
[03:38:17.017 --> 03:38:18.917]  I don't care what I have to do.
[03:38:18.917 --> 03:38:23.519]  Everybody that doesn't have a club has a pool noodle because you cannot handle the clubs yet.
[03:38:23.519 --> 03:38:24.819]  You will graduate to club.
[03:38:28.416 --> 03:38:30.757]  Now remember, you don't work for George Soros anymore.
[03:38:30.757 --> 03:38:35.918]  You work for me.
[03:38:35.918 --> 03:38:36.519]  Senator!
[03:38:36.519 --> 03:38:36.879]  Senator!
[03:38:36.879 --> 03:38:38.679]  Do you have some time for a quick interview?
[03:38:38.679 --> 03:38:40.420]  I'm on my way to a meeting.
[03:38:40.420 --> 03:38:42.160]  It'll just be a few minutes.
[03:38:42.160 --> 03:38:42.481]  What?
[03:38:42.481 --> 03:38:45.121]  Do you have any comments on the irregularities in the mail-in voting?
[03:38:45.121 --> 03:38:47.522]  I don't think there are any irregularities in the mail-in voting.
[03:38:47.522 --> 03:38:49.403]  I think the Republicans knew that.
[03:38:49.403 --> 03:38:51.563]  They knew it when they were advocating mail-in voting.
[03:38:51.563 --> 03:38:53.104]  This entire thing is a spectacle.
[03:38:53.484 --> 03:38:55.465]  What do you think about the debate so far?
[03:38:55.465 --> 03:39:04.030]  I think this administration does not treat any of our democratic process with dignity and respect, okay?
[03:39:04.030 --> 03:39:07.432]  This is a vulgar and crass administration.
[03:39:07.432 --> 03:39:08.633]  This is ridiculous.
[03:39:08.633 --> 03:39:13.135]  America is built on customs, traditions, rituals.
[03:39:13.135 --> 03:39:15.136]  It's built on respect for institutions.
[03:39:15.136 --> 03:39:16.817]  This administration has none of it.
[03:39:16.817 --> 03:39:18.959]  Do you think the president's going to accept the results of the election?
[03:39:19.699 --> 03:39:21.845]  Well, we're actually going to discuss that right now.
[03:39:21.845 --> 03:39:26.017]  You caught me on my way to a meeting to discuss just that.
[03:39:26.017 --> 03:39:26.699]  What is the meeting?
[03:39:26.699 --> 03:39:27.341]  Where are you going?
[03:39:29.508 --> 03:39:39.693]  It's an election year, and there's a lot of interested parties, and what we're trying to do is safeguard a democracy of the people, for the people, by the people.
[03:39:39.693 --> 03:39:40.573]  That's what we're doing.
[03:39:40.573 --> 03:39:41.554]  How did you find me?
[03:39:41.554 --> 03:39:44.375]  I was tailing you for a little bit.
[03:39:44.375 --> 03:39:45.996]  Clever boy, huh?
[03:39:45.996 --> 03:39:46.616]  Yeah.
[03:39:46.616 --> 03:39:47.797]  Why don't you come cover it?
[03:39:47.797 --> 03:39:48.337]  Really?
[03:39:48.337 --> 03:39:49.298]  Come cover the meeting.
[03:39:49.298 --> 03:39:50.078]  Yeah, I'd love to.
[03:39:50.078 --> 03:39:50.938]  Come cover the meeting.
[03:39:50.938 --> 03:39:51.499]  Absolutely.
[03:39:51.499 --> 03:39:52.519]  I think it's a good idea.
[03:39:52.519 --> 03:39:53.160]  I think so too.
[03:39:53.160 --> 03:39:54.460]  You want to get some footage, right?
[03:39:54.460 --> 03:39:55.301]  Yeah, please.
[03:39:55.301 --> 03:39:56.941]  You're going to meet a lot of interesting people.
[03:39:56.941 --> 03:39:57.482]  Thank you so much.
[03:40:05.546 --> 03:40:06.687]  So that's some good art there.
[03:40:06.687 --> 03:40:10.650]  But it's all based on human sacrifice, on you being worthless.
[03:40:10.650 --> 03:40:11.751]  They're feeding on you.
[03:40:11.751 --> 03:40:13.232]  Here's one more.
[03:40:13.232 --> 03:40:18.736]  Here's Tim Dillon doing his little promotion of New York City, and the fact that it's not in trouble under de Blasio.
[03:40:20.882 --> 03:40:24.265]  You know how much the most expensive apartment in this city is?
[03:40:24.265 --> 03:40:27.008]  One zillion f***ing dollars!
[03:40:27.008 --> 03:40:28.930]  How could a city like that die?
[03:40:28.930 --> 03:40:32.073]  This is the most beautiful place in the world, Central Park.
[03:40:32.073 --> 03:40:36.437]  Every day I come here, I'm amazed at how beautiful it is.
[03:40:36.437 --> 03:40:39.400]  I'm in a New York state of mind!
[03:40:39.720 --> 03:40:42.381]  We lived in a rent-controlled apartment by the park.
[03:40:42.381 --> 03:40:44.382]  Know what my mother did to get that apartment?
[03:40:44.382 --> 03:40:46.342]  She smothered her sister with a pillow.
[03:40:46.342 --> 03:40:49.263]  She killed her sister for this city!
[03:40:49.263 --> 03:40:50.063]  Yeah!
[03:40:50.063 --> 03:40:54.805]  When it hasn't been your day, your week, your month, or even your year, but...
[03:40:55.485 --> 03:40:57.726]  I'll be there for you!
[03:40:57.726 --> 03:41:00.047]  Before COVID, I had a great f***ing job!
[03:41:00.047 --> 03:41:03.069]  I used to spit on people in Central Park and they'd give me money!
[03:41:03.069 --> 03:41:05.250]  You can't get a job like that somewhere else!
[03:41:05.250 --> 03:41:06.371]  This is the greatest city!
[03:41:06.371 --> 03:41:07.951]  There's opportunities everywhere!
[03:41:07.951 --> 03:41:12.614]  Jerry Seinfeld thinks we're gonna make it and I bet he's right!
[03:41:12.614 --> 03:41:20.058]  It's the greatest city in the world, baby!
[03:41:20.058 --> 03:41:22.479]  Okay, so this is that... I'm being serious now.
[03:41:22.479 --> 03:41:24.700]  That's who Joe Rogan thinks is the best comedian alive.
[03:41:26.343 --> 03:41:31.685]  So I binge-watched a bunch of his stuff, and yeah, he's, he's, he's, they're like, oh, he's the new Chris Farley.
[03:41:31.685 --> 03:41:32.745]  Chris Farley was okay.
[03:41:32.745 --> 03:41:35.046]  A little bit of physical comedy.
[03:41:35.046 --> 03:41:37.527]  Not even 1% as good as Tim Dillon.
[03:41:37.527 --> 03:41:39.768]  So, there you go.
[03:41:39.768 --> 03:41:46.150]  Because he takes real commentary about what's happening in the current world and covers it.
[03:41:46.150 --> 03:41:49.892]  So no, Paul Watson is not married to Xi Jinping.
[03:41:49.892 --> 03:41:52.153]  Tim Dillon is not married to Joe Rogan, though they do date.
[03:41:53.380 --> 03:41:56.624]  Uh, and uh, you know, we've had a lot of fun here.
[03:41:56.624 --> 03:41:59.607]  Well, that's a shocking photo right there.
[03:41:59.607 --> 03:42:03.791]  We've joked around here, but this is a very serious time to be alive, and I'm not going to play around with the audience.
[03:42:03.791 --> 03:42:07.735]  I've had a lot of people send me this article.
[03:42:07.735 --> 03:42:09.136]  Explosive!
[03:42:09.136 --> 03:42:14.042]  CIA whistleblower exposes Biden's alleged role with deaths of SEAL team.
[03:42:14.042 --> 03:42:15.223]  Claims to have documented proof.
[03:42:17.059 --> 03:42:25.805]  And I'm not pooping on the story, but we suppose then they blew up that helicopter full of the SEALs that were part of the fake Bin Laden raid back when it happened.
[03:42:25.805 --> 03:42:33.430]  So that's going to be covered and more on the War Room with Owen Schreuer.
[03:42:33.430 --> 03:42:35.652]  And that's the big secret is it's not Tim Dillon.
[03:42:35.652 --> 03:42:37.373]  It's not Joe Rogan.
[03:42:37.373 --> 03:42:39.995]  It's not Paul Watson dating Gigi Ping.
[03:42:39.995 --> 03:42:46.279]  We found out this morning that Owen Schreuer is actually the son, the illegitimate son of Gigi Ping.
[03:42:50.011 --> 03:42:51.252]  No, that's not called fake news.
[03:42:51.252 --> 03:42:52.232]  That's called a joke.
[03:42:52.232 --> 03:42:53.113]  Ha ha!
[03:42:53.113 --> 03:42:54.033]  Ha ha!
[03:42:54.033 --> 03:42:55.234]  Ha ha!
[03:42:55.234 --> 03:42:57.135]  Um... Alright.
[03:42:57.135 --> 03:42:59.056]  I need to behave myself.
[03:42:59.056 --> 03:42:59.877]  I'm out of control.
[03:42:59.877 --> 03:43:01.718]  A lot of stuff's happened lately.
[03:43:01.718 --> 03:43:02.599]  A lot of crazy things.
[03:43:02.599 --> 03:43:03.939]  I appreciate you all.
[03:43:03.939 --> 03:43:06.701]  I'm gonna be a good boy.
[03:43:06.701 --> 03:43:08.462]  I'm gonna go take a nap.
[03:43:08.462 --> 03:43:09.923]  For about an hour.
[03:43:09.923 --> 03:43:10.824]  I'm gonna wake up.
[03:43:10.824 --> 03:43:13.145]  I'm gonna come back better than ever.
[03:43:13.145 --> 03:43:14.786]  And I'm gonna kick butt.
[03:43:14.786 --> 03:43:17.968]  But this is what happens when Paul Josephine Watson
[03:43:19.735 --> 03:43:23.478]  Does not show up for its hour of a lot of time.
[03:43:23.478 --> 03:43:28.261]  This is what happens when you piss on a man's rug.
[03:43:28.261 --> 03:43:32.905]  Like the Big Lebowski, they say, have you seen what you... Watch what happens to your car out there.
[03:43:32.905 --> 03:43:35.627]  This is, you're entering a world of hurt here.
[03:43:35.627 --> 03:43:36.407]  This is not a good thing.
[03:43:36.407 --> 03:43:39.510]  All right, I'm gonna stop.
[03:43:39.510 --> 03:43:41.031]  Seriously though, let's get really serious.
[03:43:42.383 --> 03:43:48.024]  This is the last day you get 8-Pack Power Stack, which is an amazing nutraceutical, an amazing 13-pill pack.
[03:43:48.024 --> 03:43:50.345]  We can't get any more because of the COVID lockdown.

[03:43:54.086 --> 03:43:59.227]  With all the crazy news about the lockdowns and the food and all the crap, I think everybody should get storable food.

[03:44:25.052 --> 03:44:35.300]  You've got our commitment here that we will not bow to the globalists, we will not bow to any of them, and we will go absolutely crazy in the fight against these absolute pieces of redonkulous trash.
[03:44:36.840 --> 03:44:43.266]  And then don't forget, it won't just be Owen Schroer and Da War Room coming up in T-Minus three minutes.
[03:44:44.246 --> 03:45:08.706]  We also have Deanna Lorraine and Harrison Smith, who's also Mr. Universe, and others that are hosting election countdown weeknights, 7 to 9 p.m., which David Rockefeller, may he burn in hell, and Bill Gates, may he rot in hell, and all of them cannot even stand at Band.Video.
[03:45:08.706 --> 03:45:08.886]  So,
[03:45:10.376 --> 03:45:11.416]  Great job to the crew.
[03:45:11.416 --> 03:45:15.398]  The War Room starts now.
[03:45:15.398 --> 03:45:19.800]  And whatever you do, do not do what Bill Gates doesn't want you to do.
[03:45:19.800 --> 03:45:20.920]  Do not share those links.
[03:45:20.920 --> 03:45:22.161]  Alright, love you guys.
[03:45:22.161 --> 03:45:22.561]  Great job.
