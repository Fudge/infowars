[00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:03.052]  They're running around saying it's the end of Trump, he's in deep trouble.
[00:00:03.652 --> 00:00:05.634]  Here's some of the sickening press conference yesterday.
[00:00:05.654 --> 00:00:07.855]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[00:00:09.157 --> 00:00:13.560]  Why did you lie to the American people and why should we trust what you have to say now?
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.342]  That's a terrible question and the phraseology.
[00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:17.463]  I didn't lie.
[00:00:17.944 --> 00:00:20.566]  What I said is we have to be calm, we can't be panicked.
[00:00:22.347 --> 00:00:27.472]  I knew that the tapes, these were a series of phone calls that we had, mostly phone calls.
[00:00:28.604 --> 00:00:38.547]  And Bob Woodward is somebody that I respect just from hearing the name for many, many years, not knowing too much about his work, not caring about his work.
[00:00:38.587 --> 00:00:43.608]  But I thought it would be interesting to talk to him for a period of, you know, calls.
[00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:44.969]  So we did that.
[00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:46.610]  I don't know if it's good or bad.
[00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.191]  I don't even know if the book is good or bad.
[00:00:48.791 --> 00:01:02.180]  But certainly if he thought that was a bad statement, he would have reported it because he thinks that, you know, you don't want to have anybody that is going to suffer medically because of some fact.
[00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:04.822]  And he didn't report it because he didn't think it was good.
[00:01:04.842 --> 00:01:05.883]  Well, here's what's really going on.
[00:01:05.903 --> 00:01:09.565]  They told us 4% were going to die, then 2%, then 1%.
[00:01:10.146 --> 00:01:12.087]  And the best numbers we've got vary, but it's .000
[00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.013]  And then a few numbers after it, and some areas even lower.
[00:01:19.053 --> 00:01:23.458]  Like in Australia, less than 80 people died of COVID-19 when you take out comorbidity.
[00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.180]  Did you hear what I just said?
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.243]  Less than 100 have died in the major island of Hawaii.
[00:01:28.344 --> 00:01:28.924]  They don't care.
[00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:30.126]  They just keep hyping the fear.
[00:01:31.348 --> 00:01:36.132]  And now the flu's coming that really kills people and they're saying, oh, oh, we're going to lock down over that too.
[00:01:36.612 --> 00:01:37.873]  It's never going to end, folks.
[00:01:38.574 --> 00:01:40.955]  The masks don't come off until you refuse to wear them.
[00:01:41.356 --> 00:01:50.302]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:50.322 --> 00:01:56.647]  19 years ago, the United States saw the biggest terror attack on our domestic soil in our history.
[00:01:57.628 --> 00:01:59.830]  And I was there covering it live as it unfolded.
[00:02:01.425 --> 00:02:14.920]  Dr. Steve Pucinich will join us on the specifics of 9-11 and some of the top generals he talked to that were fully aware of how the terror attacks were carried out by criminal elements inside our government working with radical Islam.
[00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:17.302]  That is coming up.
[00:02:18.003 --> 00:02:23.349]  The Hodge twins will also be joining us today and I also intend to try to open the phones up.
[00:02:25.342 --> 00:02:27.483]  It is September 11th, Friday, September 11th.
[00:02:27.503 --> 00:02:28.044]  The year is 2020.
[00:02:28.124 --> 00:02:30.705]  We're 52 days out right now.
[00:02:32.106 --> 00:02:38.470]  And I have seen Trump very few times get a tear in his eye.
[00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:47.295]  But he certainly did that yesterday in Michigan when the crowd was chanting that they love him because
[00:02:48.631 --> 00:02:53.775]  He needs that energy because he's under massive, massive attack and he also needs our prayers.
[00:02:54.436 --> 00:02:57.158]  Here's the president who had to fight back tears.
[00:03:05.404 --> 00:03:06.964]  Especially when you have a crowd like this.
[00:03:07.024 --> 00:03:07.805]  But they're like this.
[00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:09.425]  They have such spirit in this country.
[00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:11.186]  People love our country so much.
[00:03:11.226 --> 00:03:12.006]  I went to Texas.
[00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:12.766]  I went to Ohio.
[00:03:12.786 --> 00:03:13.466]  I went to Florida.
[00:03:13.846 --> 00:03:15.787]  It's always, it's always like this.
[00:03:15.827 --> 00:03:18.047]  They love, they love our country.
[00:03:18.508 --> 00:03:20.408]  And we're not going to disappoint anybody.
[00:03:20.448 --> 00:03:22.729]  We're not disappointed.
[00:03:23.169 --> 00:03:26.370]  For years, you had a president who apologized for America.
[00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:35.106]  We love you!
[00:03:35.487 --> 00:03:36.447]  We love you!
[00:03:36.847 --> 00:03:37.708]  We love you!
[00:03:38.088 --> 00:03:39.668]  We love you!
[00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.409]  We love you!
[00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:58.849]  Absolute violence and carnage if Trump wins, but even more violence if he loses because the communist mob is going to try to take control of the Biden administration.
[00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:03.093]  And that's why Soros and the Deep State are putting Biden in, they hope, because he's weak.
[00:04:03.553 --> 00:04:04.734]  And I concur with that analysis.
[00:04:04.754 --> 00:04:07.176]  We'll be talking about that coming up next segment.
[00:04:07.477 --> 00:04:10.940]  But the big thing we're going to break down right up front here today
[00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:25.456]  Is they've tried to brand the Chinese communist Wuhan virus as the European virus, as the Trump virus, as the American virus, and now they're claiming because Trump, most of the stuff in Woodward's book is a fraud, but Trump early on said, boy, it does look deadly.
[00:04:25.916 --> 00:04:27.496]  They were saying it killed 4% of people.
[00:04:27.796 --> 00:04:29.237]  We said it might actually be deadly.
[00:04:29.277 --> 00:04:29.877]  We didn't know.
[00:04:30.438 --> 00:04:35.600]  Then things changed as we learned that they'd hyped it up and exaggerated it to a level of fraud.
[00:04:36.636 --> 00:04:43.438]  They're acting like now he's behind the virus and he killed 190,000 people, when again most of those died of something else.
[00:04:43.518 --> 00:04:48.279]  It's just incredible fraud, but they're running around saying it's the end of Trump, he's in deep trouble.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.900]  Here's some of the sickening press conference yesterday.
[00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:53.081]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:58.812]  Why did you lie to the American people and why should we trust what you have to say now?
[00:04:58.852 --> 00:05:01.594]  That's a terrible question and the phraseology.
[00:05:01.614 --> 00:05:02.715]  I didn't lie.
[00:05:03.175 --> 00:05:05.817]  What I said is we have to be calm, we can't be panicked.
[00:05:07.578 --> 00:05:12.702]  I knew that the tapes were, these were a series of phone calls that we had, mostly phone calls.
[00:05:13.843 --> 00:05:23.794]  And Bob Woodward is somebody that I respect just from hearing the name for many, many years, not knowing too much about his work, not caring about his work.
[00:05:23.854 --> 00:05:28.839]  But I thought it would be interesting to talk to him for a period of, you know, calls.
[00:05:29.519 --> 00:05:30.239]  So we did that.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.860]  I don't know if it's good or bad.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.440]  I don't even know if the book is good or bad.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:47.424]  But certainly if he thought that was a bad statement, he would have reported it because he thinks that, you know, you don't want to have anybody that is going to suffer medically because of some fact.
[00:05:48.124 --> 00:05:50.065]  And he didn't report it because he didn't think it was good.
[00:05:50.085 --> 00:05:51.125]  Well, here's what's really going on.
[00:05:51.145 --> 00:05:54.806]  They told us 4% were going to die, then 2%, then 1%.
[00:05:55.386 --> 00:05:57.307]  And the best numbers we've got vary, but it's...
[00:05:58.027 --> 00:06:04.271]  Point zero zero zero, and then a few numbers after it, and some areas even lower.
[00:06:04.311 --> 00:06:08.713]  Like in Australia, less than 80 people died of COVID-19, when you take out comorbidity.
[00:06:09.374 --> 00:06:10.434]  Did you hear what I just said?
[00:06:10.895 --> 00:06:13.496]  Less than 100 have died in the major island of Hawaii.
[00:06:13.596 --> 00:06:14.177]  They don't care.
[00:06:14.257 --> 00:06:15.437]  They just keep hyping the fear.
[00:06:16.598 --> 00:06:21.401]  And now the flu's coming that really kills people, and they're saying, oh, oh, we're gonna lock down over that, too.
[00:06:21.861 --> 00:06:23.122]  It's never gonna end, folks.
[00:06:23.822 --> 00:06:26.184]  The masks don't come off until you refuse to wear them.
[00:06:27.099 --> 00:06:31.460]  The answer is when they started beating up that woman, the Spanish police, the people started beating them up.
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.401]  That's the answer to communists.
[00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:35.221]  Don't submit to them.
[00:06:35.381 --> 00:06:35.861]  Stay with us.
[00:06:37.321 --> 00:06:44.883]  Yeah, they try to confuse our young 18-year-olds to serve evil and to join corruption and to reject God and their families.
[00:06:45.783 --> 00:06:51.725]  But a lot of 18-year-olds are adults, mentally, and they know how to refuse corruption.
[00:06:52.944 --> 00:06:54.104]  But what if you're three years old?
[00:06:54.765 --> 00:06:57.206]  You're being raped by a liberal devil worshiper.
[00:06:59.006 --> 00:07:05.629]  Well, then you have your innocence ruined for life and statistically you end up about half the time being a pedophile yourself.
[00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:13.731]  We got articles out today, mainstream news, men raping babies on video.
[00:07:14.332 --> 00:07:16.412]  It's the new liberal trendy thing to do and pass it around.
[00:07:19.033 --> 00:07:20.554]  And the media is defending it.
[00:07:23.271 --> 00:07:29.800]  Now I wasn't going to cover this today because it was too disgusting until I was watching when I got up about 5 a.m.
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:41.395]  this morning, the Anna Lorraine host election countdown last night, and I didn't know that a major movie star, actress, you name it, I've actually seen a few of her things, I'm a fan of her husband.
[00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:47.944]  Blake Lively came out and talked about how Hollywood is into raping newborn babies.
[00:07:47.984 --> 00:07:50.925]  Their favorite thing is when they still have the umbilical cord attached to them.
[00:07:51.646 --> 00:08:00.651]  Now that's the kind of stuff I'm aware of from what's come out, what's come out in police reports over the years, snuff films, things you don't really see in the news but comes out in court.
[00:08:02.632 --> 00:08:08.035]  And she talks about the law enforcement she's talked to that witnesses these devil worshippers raping newborn babies.
[00:08:08.975 --> 00:08:11.937]  Because they have women that specially breed to have the babies.
[00:08:13.056 --> 00:08:13.577]  I don't
[00:08:30.387 --> 00:08:31.728]  I just thought I better tell people about it.
[00:08:31.788 --> 00:08:34.810]  So we'll cover that later in this hour.
[00:08:35.291 --> 00:08:40.555]  But the full breakdown by Deanna Lorraine is posted on InfoWars.com.
[00:08:40.595 --> 00:08:43.657]  Blake Lively gives emotional speech on child pornography.
[00:08:44.137 --> 00:08:47.700]  The systematic pedophile agenda is exposing itself in the world.
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.162]  That's the headline that Deanna Lorraine gave it.
[00:08:50.642 --> 00:08:51.463]  It's at BandOnVideo.
[00:08:52.719 --> 00:09:01.188]  So, this is all coming out, and without even intending to cover this today, I just, I sent him the video, but I probably wasn't going to cover it.
[00:09:01.648 --> 00:09:10.177]  I had two articles in my stack about raping babies and videotaping it and passing it around, and I thought, you know, I better cover it.
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.363]  That's without looking for this, it's just everywhere.
[00:09:16.616 --> 00:09:20.039]  Can you imagine the police that have to look at this stuff?
[00:09:20.719 --> 00:09:35.730]  I've talked to some of them and General Flynn's lawyer has talked to them and it is horrific to have to look at a bunch of people that look like Brian Stelter with big demon smiles on their faces doing these type of things.
[00:09:35.770 --> 00:09:38.272]  I'm not saying Brian Stelter does it, I'm just saying they look like Brian Stelter.
[00:09:40.956 --> 00:09:43.157]  God help us, just absolutely God help us.
[00:09:43.257 --> 00:09:44.657]  The bottomless pit.
[00:09:45.377 --> 00:09:47.217]  It means there's no bottom to it.
[00:09:48.298 --> 00:09:50.918]  There's no levels that they won't sink to.
[00:09:50.958 --> 00:09:51.799]  They like it.
[00:09:52.399 --> 00:09:53.419]  They enjoy it.
[00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.261]  And by the way, they don't just rape these babies.
[00:10:02.661 --> 00:10:04.521]  They torture the living hell out of them and kill them.
[00:10:05.602 --> 00:10:06.762]  So that's all coming up.
[00:10:09.127 --> 00:10:10.909]  And you know, we can't let this get us down.
[00:10:11.429 --> 00:10:17.436]  There's big articles out today that the already record suicides have now broken other records.
[00:10:20.422 --> 00:10:23.643]  And the number of people considering suicide is broken records.
[00:10:24.343 --> 00:10:29.444]  And when you go look at who they are, they're military, they're police, they're Christians, they're hardworking.
[00:10:30.084 --> 00:10:36.706]  White men is the largest group who are giving up on society, but it's black men, brown men, it's everybody.
[00:10:36.866 --> 00:10:37.266]  It's men.
[00:10:38.106 --> 00:10:40.847]  And they kill themselves because they can't handle the immorality.
[00:10:41.867 --> 00:10:43.688]  You need to stand up for the children.
[00:10:43.748 --> 00:10:49.609]  You need to prosecute and go after the globalists.
[00:10:50.612 --> 00:10:57.755]  You want to politically and economically, and then when the time comes, if they keep pushing this physical stuff, physically, we make them pay!
[00:10:58.075 --> 00:10:58.976]  We don't pay!
[00:10:58.996 --> 00:11:03.197]  You don't kill yourself, you throw yourself at the enemy.
[00:11:05.879 --> 00:11:09.480]  But people with conscience are the ones killing themselves because they can't handle it.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.141]  Don't kill yourself.
[00:11:13.134 --> 00:11:15.455]  That's a coward's way out, and I'm not blaming folks that do it.
[00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:17.815]  I'm just saying, don't.
[00:11:17.955 --> 00:11:22.817]  You fight corruption, you get involved going up against the enemy, you're not gonna be depressed anymore.
[00:11:23.477 --> 00:11:27.378]  You're gonna have that hunger that an attack dog has when it's going after the enemy.
[00:11:29.658 --> 00:11:38.541]  Give in to that, God's spirit of vengeance, because vengeance is mine, sayeth the Lord, but God has instruments of vengeance.
[00:11:40.021 --> 00:11:41.882]  So, stop caring what people think,
[00:11:42.876 --> 00:11:45.877]  Stop caring about the world saying you don't have status.
[00:11:46.337 --> 00:11:53.100]  Stop caring about how nice your car is or, you know, if your wife's broken up with you and your kid's got problems, just stay in the fight.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.901]  Don't blow your head off, whether you're black or white, old or young.
[00:11:59.102 --> 00:12:11.147]  We'll talk about some of that, but what I'll do at the start of the next segment is I'll get into the huge news of them pinning COVID-19 on the president and twisting something Bob Woodward said that, oh, Trump thought the virus was deadly.
[00:12:12.674 --> 00:12:16.075]  Back in February and March, well, the news said it was killing 4% of people.
[00:12:17.515 --> 00:12:18.535]  That's ultra deadly.
[00:12:19.456 --> 00:12:24.777]  Turned out it was a fraction of a fraction of a fraction, and then Trump changed his view properly so.
[00:12:26.197 --> 00:12:28.598]  I said, looks like it's overblown, but boy, better get ready.
[00:12:30.118 --> 00:12:36.520]  With the scenes of End of the World, we were witnessing that we now know was a major put on in Communist China to shut down Hong Kong and Taiwan.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:38.640]  And G.G.
[00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:39.941]  Pings basically admitted that now.
[00:12:40.042 --> 00:12:42.324]  So that's all coming up today.
[00:12:42.484 --> 00:12:44.145]  And just incredible developments.
[00:12:44.185 --> 00:12:47.868]  Democrats caught on tape saying nothing opens up until after the election.
[00:12:48.849 --> 00:12:49.970]  And it's still not going to open up.
[00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:53.933]  Once these cult leaders get a mask on your face, they never take them off.
[00:12:55.315 --> 00:12:59.458]  And Fauci says Americans need to hunker down for fall and winter.
[00:12:59.518 --> 00:13:01.160]  And no, it's never going to end.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.702]  Oh, he's such a little lying piece of crap.
[00:13:06.946 --> 00:13:07.947]  There's some other good news.
[00:13:08.407 --> 00:13:15.813]  Big tech companies reconsider relying on SPLC after hearing about scandals and terror attacks that they run.
[00:13:16.234 --> 00:13:19.957]  And they're billions of bucks offshore and now they're run by foreign intelligence agencies.
[00:13:22.779 --> 00:13:25.361]  SPLC is in Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[00:13:25.441 --> 00:13:27.503]  They run all the moderation.
[00:13:27.783 --> 00:13:29.885]  Hundreds of thousands of people trained by them.
[00:13:31.686 --> 00:13:34.969]  That's all coming up in a lot of campaign trail news.
[00:13:35.189 --> 00:13:35.950]  And like I said,
[00:13:37.028 --> 00:13:44.351]  If you think 10-year-old girls twerking in front of men who then let them commit crimes because they're sexually attracted to them, it's so disgusting.
[00:13:46.031 --> 00:13:48.552]  If you think that's bad, they're distracting with this show, Cuties.
[00:13:48.852 --> 00:13:54.174]  They've got stuff on Netflix where, again, 10-year-old boys are having sex with full-grown men.
[00:13:56.555 --> 00:13:58.695]  Pedophilia just absolutely in your face.
[00:13:59.876 --> 00:14:02.937]  And they use something like Cuties that's bad, but it's like...
[00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:06.444]  Low level compared to the hardcore stuff that's on there.
[00:14:06.464 --> 00:14:07.265]  That's how they distract.
[00:14:07.285 --> 00:14:10.605]  And then that ties into all the hardcore stuff.
[00:14:10.645 --> 00:14:12.005]  And we also have the NFL.
[00:14:13.846 --> 00:14:17.686]  The Texans refused to even take the field during the Star Spangled Banner.
[00:14:20.607 --> 00:14:25.308]  And the other team took their knees in all this crap for diversity because America's bad.
[00:14:26.668 --> 00:14:29.909]  Then Lululemon said capitalism in America's bad.
[00:14:29.969 --> 00:14:31.669]  And guess where they make their stuff?
[00:14:31.729 --> 00:14:32.049]  China.
[00:14:33.664 --> 00:14:40.767]  I mean, it's like saying Stalin comes out against communism or something.
[00:14:40.867 --> 00:14:42.148]  It's ridiculous.
[00:14:42.468 --> 00:14:44.249]  These companies are so evil, so bad.
[00:14:44.789 --> 00:14:50.051]  And then we wonder why a bunch of followers, a bunch of NFL players are told by their corporate sponsors do that.
[00:14:50.392 --> 00:14:52.953]  So they do it for money, money, money, money, money, money.
[00:14:54.313 --> 00:14:56.154]  Well, then don't give the NFL your money.
[00:14:56.214 --> 00:14:57.475]  It's been fake forever.
[00:14:57.815 --> 00:15:00.076]  Oh, the games are real, but it's all empty.
[00:15:00.356 --> 00:15:02.357]  It's all a joke and it robs manhood.
[00:15:03.677 --> 00:15:08.239]  Everybody thinks boxing is manhood, or the NFL is manhood, or baseball is manhood.
[00:15:09.180 --> 00:15:10.400]  No, that's a diversion.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.361]  That's entertainment.
[00:15:11.681 --> 00:15:17.043]  Manhood's taking care of your children, working hard, loving God, standing up for what's right, having moral courage.
[00:15:17.343 --> 00:15:21.765]  And these people in sports are the worst of the worst of the worst.
[00:15:22.105 --> 00:15:23.506]  They don't have moral integrity.
[00:15:23.866 --> 00:15:24.687]  They don't have honor.
[00:15:24.887 --> 00:15:25.607]  They don't have strength.
[00:15:25.807 --> 00:15:31.530]  And they work for a system of true slave masters that run slave camps, Nike,
[00:15:32.583 --> 00:15:40.123]  is the biggest apparel maker in areas known to have Christian, Muslim, and Buddhist slave labor.
[00:15:40.163 --> 00:15:40.925]  So does Lululemon.
[00:15:42.554 --> 00:15:48.077]  But they tell you decolonize gender, white people are bad, while they let the chi-coms run the slave camps.
[00:15:48.718 --> 00:15:50.739]  This is an evil organization.
[00:15:50.759 --> 00:15:57.823]  They're all evil, because they're all financed by the big megabanks that are one mind, one satanic vision to destroy you and your family.
[00:15:58.604 --> 00:16:03.006]  All these subgroups want the loans, so they all follow the orders.
[00:16:03.547 --> 00:16:05.168]  They're your enemy, period.
[00:16:05.948 --> 00:16:06.429]  Period.
[00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:07.471]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:07.491 --> 00:16:07.952]  Stay with us.
[00:16:08.252 --> 00:16:09.114]  Infowars.com.
[00:16:09.134 --> 00:16:10.817]  Tomorrow's news of the day.
[00:16:10.837 --> 00:16:11.458]  52 days out.
[00:16:11.619 --> 00:16:12.861]  It is September 11th.
[00:16:12.881 --> 00:16:13.282]  The year is 2020.
[00:16:13.482 --> 00:16:17.629]  Thank you for joining us on this live, teleprompter-free Friday edition.
[00:16:19.355 --> 00:16:21.576]  So, the media is beating the drum.
[00:16:21.716 --> 00:16:22.817]  We knew they would do it.
[00:16:22.857 --> 00:16:24.758]  They were always going to blame the virus on Trump.
[00:16:25.419 --> 00:16:31.522]  The UN said months ago that the pandemic is over in China, that the pandemic is over in Europe.
[00:16:32.022 --> 00:16:37.666]  It was never an epidemic, meaning enough numbers of people actually getting sick and dying.
[00:16:38.286 --> 00:16:42.249]  It was a pandemic, meaning a lot of people were testing positive.
[00:16:42.309 --> 00:16:43.829]  But they wanted to turn Europe
[00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.091]  And turn other areas back on.
[00:16:47.251 --> 00:16:50.792]  But they're never going to say that America can be turned back on.
[00:16:50.892 --> 00:16:53.873]  Even if Biden gets in, the plan is to lock us down.
[00:16:53.893 --> 00:16:57.055]  I'm going to show you some of those documents and some of those admissions.
[00:16:57.115 --> 00:16:59.896]  So it's all semantical manipulation.
[00:16:59.936 --> 00:17:02.797]  Just like I've gone out, Penn and Teller have done it.
[00:17:02.837 --> 00:17:03.677]  Many others have done it.
[00:17:04.717 --> 00:17:05.658]  Mark Dice has done it.
[00:17:06.438 --> 00:17:14.081]  You go out to any group, university students, adults, and you say, dihydrogen monoxide is running off into the creeks and rivers.
[00:17:14.977 --> 00:17:16.519]  You know, it's a big problem.
[00:17:16.559 --> 00:17:17.361]  We'd like to ban it.
[00:17:18.022 --> 00:17:20.946]  Almost everyone signs a petition to ban dihydrogen monoxide.
[00:17:20.966 --> 00:17:22.448]  It's water.
[00:17:23.524 --> 00:17:27.527]  They'll also sign a petition to ban salt, when you use the technical name.
[00:17:28.007 --> 00:17:30.489]  Because to most people, science sounds scary.
[00:17:31.229 --> 00:17:36.073]  That's why Fauci says trust the science, because everything he's saying is a lie, and it's not science.
[00:17:36.413 --> 00:17:42.977]  And the UN and big media and big tech censor medical doctors saying you're not allowed to question the UN.
[00:17:43.418 --> 00:17:47.140]  The essence of the scientific method is being challenged.
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:48.501]  Your hypothesis.
[00:17:49.141 --> 00:17:49.942]  Your postulates.
[00:17:50.682 --> 00:17:52.384]  But again, this is war on reality.
[00:17:53.064 --> 00:17:57.286]  So here's the president being asked about why he lied to the people.
[00:17:57.326 --> 00:17:57.826]  Here it is.
[00:17:58.966 --> 00:17:59.767]  Thank you, Mr. President.
[00:18:01.087 --> 00:18:05.489]  Why did you lie to the American people and why should we trust what you have to say now?
[00:18:05.509 --> 00:18:08.270]  That's a terrible question and the phraseology.
[00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:09.390]  I didn't lie.
[00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:11.391]  What I said is we have to be calm.
[00:18:11.451 --> 00:18:12.471]  We can't be panicked.
[00:18:14.272 --> 00:18:19.374]  I knew that the tapes were, these were a series of phone calls that we had, mostly phone calls.
[00:18:20.536 --> 00:18:24.539]  And Bob Woodward is somebody that I respect.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:25.580]  And it goes on from there.
[00:18:26.261 --> 00:18:27.902]  So we're talking six months ago.
[00:18:29.243 --> 00:18:30.945]  They're saying two to four percent are going to die.
[00:18:31.645 --> 00:18:33.387]  And Trump's like, yeah, it looks like it's nasty stuff.
[00:18:34.448 --> 00:18:36.629]  But then he came out and said, be calm, everything will be fine.
[00:18:36.649 --> 00:18:37.410]  We got therapeutics.
[00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.552]  Turned out it was totally exaggerated.
[00:18:40.152 --> 00:18:42.915]  A scam, a fraud, a con job, not a hoax.
[00:18:42.995 --> 00:18:43.815]  The virus is real.
[00:18:44.096 --> 00:18:44.916]  It can kill people.
[00:18:45.216 --> 00:18:47.899]  Any virus can kill you if you don't have the right vitamins and nutrients.
[00:18:47.919 --> 00:18:49.120]  That's why they're called essential.
[00:18:50.319 --> 00:18:51.280]  You don't have vitamin C?
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:19:01.045]  You can put somebody in a pod with no bacteria or viruses and they'll die usually within three months with no vitamin C. It's essential.
[00:19:01.765 --> 00:19:03.406]  Same thing with D. I know I keep harping.
[00:19:03.466 --> 00:19:04.187]  I know you know that.
[00:19:04.667 --> 00:19:05.727]  The fall and winter is coming.
[00:19:05.747 --> 00:19:12.291]  They're going to have real deaths for people locked inside, getting no vitamin D3 from the sun, and not having C and zinc.
[00:19:12.531 --> 00:19:13.852]  So you want to beat these murderers.
[00:19:14.232 --> 00:19:18.694]  Tell everyone you know zinc, C, and D3.
[00:19:20.014 --> 00:19:21.014]  Like your life depends on it.
[00:19:21.035 --> 00:19:24.176]  We're going to get around to some fact sheets we're going to get up this weekend.
[00:19:24.196 --> 00:19:25.116]  I'm a little bit behind on it.
[00:19:25.497 --> 00:19:27.558]  With medical doctor quotes and factoids.
[00:19:27.778 --> 00:19:30.159]  So you can print them off at InfoWars and share them with people.
[00:19:30.459 --> 00:19:32.760]  Just have like a one page with stuff on each side.
[00:19:32.780 --> 00:19:33.961]  Hand those out there.
[00:19:34.021 --> 00:19:34.701]  Put them on doors.
[00:19:34.761 --> 00:19:35.441]  Put them on cars.
[00:19:35.822 --> 00:19:36.342]  You do that.
[00:19:36.442 --> 00:19:38.523]  It'll save hundreds of thousands of lives.
[00:19:38.843 --> 00:19:43.845]  And these murderers won't have those deaths to then use to take all of our freedoms.
[00:19:43.885 --> 00:19:44.666]  So it's a win-win.
[00:19:46.664 --> 00:19:47.384]  But let's continue.
[00:19:47.424 --> 00:19:48.225]  Here's Fauci.
[00:19:48.245 --> 00:19:54.448]  Dr. Fauci says Americans need to hunker down for fall and winter and then never shake hands again and this is never going to end.
[00:19:55.008 --> 00:19:55.688]  Total fraud.
[00:19:55.729 --> 00:19:57.129]  But China, everybody else is over business.
[00:19:58.650 --> 00:20:04.673]  Meanwhile, LA Health Director says schools won't reopen until after election.
[00:20:04.913 --> 00:20:07.534]  James Woods tweeted out and said, man, look how unhealthy she looks.
[00:20:07.654 --> 00:20:10.596]  And Snopes said it was a fake photo, which it wasn't.
[00:20:10.616 --> 00:20:11.656]  It was from Getty Images.
[00:20:11.977 --> 00:20:14.398]  But Snopes is God and they said it was fake.
[00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:25.574]  No, that's what these health directors really look like, and folks have put together montages of them all over the world, looking like she could star in a zombie movie right now, no makeup needed.
[00:20:25.614 --> 00:20:29.676]  I mean, she looks like she just climbed out of a coffin.
[00:20:30.676 --> 00:20:35.438]  Absolutely incredible, and we're gonna get to more of that coming up, but let's continue.
[00:20:37.258 --> 00:20:40.980]  So Trump says he didn't lie about virus bombshell.
[00:20:42.619 --> 00:20:48.384]  Because he said, oh yeah, it looks really nasty six months ago when we were seeing images of the apocalypse in China.
[00:20:50.005 --> 00:20:50.726]  Deadly stuff.
[00:20:51.146 --> 00:20:53.328]  Trump's own words bring focus back to virus.
[00:20:53.968 --> 00:20:55.810]  But now we know it isn't deadly.
[00:20:56.210 --> 00:20:58.852]  It's very, very rare to make somebody sick or kill somebody.
[00:20:58.872 --> 00:21:00.253]  Almost everybody is asymptomatic.
[00:21:01.174 --> 00:21:07.940]  So, they think you're illogical and you don't know the difference of six, seven months ago versus what the president says now.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.961]  They're like, look at people at his rallies!
[00:21:10.242 --> 00:21:11.463]  They're not wearing masks!
[00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.332]  But then it's okay, Black Lives Matter for them not to wear a mask.
[00:21:14.392 --> 00:21:15.713]  It's all fraud.
[00:21:17.334 --> 00:21:19.636]  But here's some of the original information on it.
[00:21:20.957 --> 00:21:23.319]  Coronavirus, now a pandemic.
[00:21:23.379 --> 00:21:25.441]  How does that differ from an epidemic or outbreak?
[00:21:25.481 --> 00:21:27.122]  That was months and months ago.
[00:21:27.182 --> 00:21:28.343]  That's Yahoo News.
[00:21:29.084 --> 00:21:31.486]  Well, an epidemic means you're getting sick and dying.
[00:21:32.146 --> 00:21:36.009]  Pandemic just means a lot of people have the virus, which again, most of it's false positives.
[00:21:37.070 --> 00:21:40.313]  Coronavirus clinically no longer exists in Italy, doctor says.
[00:21:40.693 --> 00:21:41.634]  That was back in June.
[00:21:43.442 --> 00:21:48.586]  COVID-19 will not soon lose status as epidemic under the CDC update.
[00:21:49.006 --> 00:21:52.048]  They changed it saying no one needs to be sick now to call it an epidemic.
[00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:57.893]  Who no longer uses pandemic category, but COVID-19's still an emergency.
[00:21:58.313 --> 00:22:02.236]  So the UN's not even calling it a global pandemic, meaning a lot of people have it.
[00:22:02.937 --> 00:22:08.341]  But in America, we still call it that because, again, it's only targeting us to keep us locked down.
[00:22:10.702 --> 00:22:12.284]  So that's how these scams work.
[00:22:13.359 --> 00:22:18.603]  Meanwhile, the CDC cloth mask used to stop COVID-19 will not stop wildfire smoke inhalation.
[00:22:20.364 --> 00:22:23.266]  Even though the virus is much smaller than the average smoke particula.
[00:22:23.646 --> 00:22:24.306]  It's all fraud.
[00:22:24.607 --> 00:22:26.108]  The masks don't protect you, it's all pure crap.
[00:22:28.189 --> 00:22:35.014]  The medical masks are so the doctor doesn't breathe anything he has onto an open patient having surgery.
[00:22:35.034 --> 00:22:38.216]  And that's a good thing, so they don't cough or spit or sneeze onto you.
[00:22:40.185 --> 00:22:43.107]  They've also got a visor to protect their eyes if they're sawing bone or whatever.
[00:22:43.728 --> 00:22:48.771]  But the idea of walking around with gloves is just as dirty as your hands and wearing these stupid masks.
[00:22:48.832 --> 00:22:50.953]  It's all placebo.
[00:22:53.495 --> 00:22:54.256]  But here she is.
[00:22:54.296 --> 00:22:55.116]  We got the audio.
[00:22:55.336 --> 00:22:55.577]  L.A.
[00:22:55.657 --> 00:23:01.341]  Public Health Director caught on tape saying schools will stay shut until after the election.
[00:23:01.361 --> 00:23:02.862]  KTLA 600 has the audio.
[00:23:05.879 --> 00:23:08.340]  But again, all these photos show what she really looks like.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:14.542]  She looks like she has 0% fat and has been in a concentration camp under Hitler.
[00:23:15.622 --> 00:23:23.504]  But I have the Associated Press attacking, saying it's doctored, she looks great, she looks super duper healthy.
[00:23:24.364 --> 00:23:25.825]  Photo edited to make L.A.
[00:23:25.885 --> 00:23:27.385]  County Health Director appear sick.
[00:23:27.425 --> 00:23:27.705]  Really?
[00:23:28.246 --> 00:23:31.307]  Go watch video of her press conference a few days ago.
[00:23:31.367 --> 00:23:32.467]  She looks even worse!
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.262]  I've never seen someone walking around looks this bad.
[00:23:36.682 --> 00:23:42.087]  She looks like she's starving more than little African children that are in a huge drought and that die.
[00:23:44.068 --> 00:23:46.270]  Again, World War Z, no makeup needed.
[00:23:46.290 --> 00:23:47.491]  She can be a zombie right now.
[00:23:49.593 --> 00:23:56.519]  But oh, Snopes says, Snopes is God, Snopes says she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
[00:23:57.557 --> 00:23:58.357]  False claim!
[00:23:58.417 --> 00:23:59.138]  Photo of L.A.
[00:23:59.198 --> 00:24:02.979]  County Health Director Barbara Ferrer shows her looking unwell.
[00:24:03.599 --> 00:24:04.579]  No, just look at her!
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.540]  From McGeady's photo on InfoWars.
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.161]  Why, she looks great!
[00:24:10.802 --> 00:24:11.762]  Here's some more of these women.
[00:24:11.802 --> 00:24:12.782]  Document cam shot, please.
[00:24:15.123 --> 00:24:17.204]  Here's Dr. Beth Bell, CDC.
[00:24:17.244 --> 00:24:19.765]  Looks like she's like the same space alien or something.
[00:24:20.445 --> 00:24:23.386]  Look at this woman, Belgian Health Minister, Maggie de Bloch.
[00:24:23.446 --> 00:24:25.487]  Boy, did no job of the hut at a sister.
[00:24:26.601 --> 00:24:32.044]  Barbara Garcia, director of San Francisco Department of Public Health, looks like Nadler's sister.
[00:24:33.285 --> 00:24:37.468]  San Francisco Public Health, all these guys look like demons.
[00:24:37.548 --> 00:24:39.609]  Why do they all look like they're dying?
[00:24:40.550 --> 00:24:45.533]  Because you reap what you sow, and those that live by medical tyranny die by medical tyranny.
[00:24:47.954 --> 00:24:48.735]  All right, my friends.
[00:24:49.881 --> 00:24:51.582]  Here is the final equation.
[00:24:52.402 --> 00:25:07.528]  There is an extremely predatory group of people that go out of their way and even destroy their own self-interest and their own children to dumb people down, mutate people, poison people, and turn us against each other, setting us up for an end-of-planet event.
[00:25:08.509 --> 00:25:13.511]  Now, the Bible says an off-world entity was marooned here by the Creator
[00:25:16.365 --> 00:25:21.306]  And because we have free will, that entity is allowed to try to trick us and destroy ourselves.
[00:25:23.166 --> 00:25:25.027]  Satan comes to kill, steal, and destroy.
[00:25:25.687 --> 00:25:26.887]  He was cast out of heaven.
[00:25:31.008 --> 00:25:38.089]  And now all the mathematics and all the science show all these dimensions above, below, and around us in the multiverses.
[00:25:39.409 --> 00:25:41.530]  And I can tell you, as I've been telling you for 20 plus years,
[00:25:42.703 --> 00:25:56.255]  None of the globalists, not the Rockefellers, not the Rothschilds, not Elon Musk, none of them believe that there's not other entities and a controller that they're rebelling against that they believe they're going to break free from.
[00:25:56.275 --> 00:26:00.018]  And you notice Elon Musk came out about six months after I was on Joe Rogan.
[00:26:01.559 --> 00:26:07.184]  Three years ago, on episode 911, he basically repeated everything I said about the establishment and what they believe.
[00:26:07.525 --> 00:26:08.886]  This is what they believe.
[00:26:11.297 --> 00:26:17.579]  So when I tell you all of this, it's very, very important for you to not just think that I'm here making this up.
[00:26:18.899 --> 00:26:20.119]  Yes, it's fantastical.
[00:26:20.179 --> 00:26:20.999]  Yes, it's crazy.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:26.121]  But until you pull back and look at it, it's not human.
[00:26:27.941 --> 00:26:29.261]  This is not being done for us.
[00:26:34.042 --> 00:26:35.863]  And so a lot of people go along with the system
[00:26:37.489 --> 00:26:43.210]  Thinking that having a bigger house, having more money, having a better car, that that's the final symbol of success.
[00:26:44.691 --> 00:26:45.191]  And it's not.
[00:26:45.291 --> 00:27:01.455]  You have to understand that we have this ancient species that we come from into the future and maintaining that species integrity is the most important thing because it is cultural, spiritual death to allow that chain to be broken.
[00:27:03.315 --> 00:27:05.476]  And it gets into the laws of nature and
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:14.724]  The fact that things come in threes, and a lot of understanding that I've not read in books, but that I have come to know.
[00:27:14.744 --> 00:27:21.647]  And it's extremely important that people know this information, and it's why they want us off the air.
[00:27:22.828 --> 00:27:25.509]  But they metaphysically have to be very careful how they do it.
[00:27:25.529 --> 00:27:29.872]  They need to trick us into sabotaging ourselves, or trick someone else into killing us.
[00:27:30.472 --> 00:27:34.194]  They themselves are blocked by God's rules from moving against us.
[00:27:36.141 --> 00:27:46.505]  And moving against you, if you understand that spiritual dominion, that spiritual deed that you have over the enemy.
[00:27:48.146 --> 00:27:55.709]  So everything the enemy does is to hurt us, and to make us depressed, and make us kill ourselves, and make us give up.
[00:27:55.889 --> 00:28:02.732]  But if you realize that that is all a put on, and a rope-a-dope, and a scam,
[00:28:05.598 --> 00:28:14.703]  And just open the connection to God and the infinite and just ask God to defend you, then the gates of hell will not prevail against us.
[00:28:17.904 --> 00:28:27.749]  But you look at the people that serve Satan, Soros and the Clintons and all these other people, they know what they're doing and they've been put in power because they're weak.
[00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:29.770]  They're not elites.
[00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:31.211]  We call them elites.
[00:28:31.811 --> 00:28:32.932]  That's the name they have themselves.
[00:28:32.952 --> 00:28:33.312]  They're not.
[00:28:35.438 --> 00:28:36.479]  They are jokes.
[00:28:38.501 --> 00:28:39.242]  They are slaves.
[00:28:41.764 --> 00:28:57.539]  And the people that follow them, at a primitive level, believe that there's a social contract, even though they don't know what that is, that term, and they believe these are leaders that really care about them.
[00:28:57.959 --> 00:28:59.441]  And it's up to us that are leaders
[00:29:00.862 --> 00:29:11.509]  To understand that the people following Satan's plan are slaves, and they're trying to lead other people into slavery, and that we have a responsibility not to just sit there and complain about this, but to challenge the enemy.
[00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:16.032]  And to occupy and to conquer the land.
[00:29:17.954 --> 00:29:18.554]  Metaphysically.
[00:29:19.615 --> 00:29:22.517]  So I'm going to stop preaching and get back into all the news, because there's plenty of it today.
[00:29:23.358 --> 00:29:26.740]  And I want to get into the history of 9-11 and where all that's going and so much more, but
[00:29:29.653 --> 00:29:35.759]  Think about the gaslighting, the brainwashing of Nadler saying no such thing as Antifa.
[00:29:38.301 --> 00:29:39.542]  Or that Antifa are peaceful.
[00:29:41.263 --> 00:29:47.529]  Or they're calling these guys that were trying to chase down and kill Rittenhouse victims and heroes who survived a massacre.
[00:29:47.569 --> 00:29:50.131]  I mean, that's all upside-down world.
[00:29:50.512 --> 00:29:51.773]  But look at Nadler!
[00:29:53.274 --> 00:29:55.076]  I mean, if you chose one out of 50,000 people
[00:29:57.281 --> 00:30:02.106]  To physically look like a cartoon character, the image of weakness, it's him.
[00:30:03.287 --> 00:30:07.791]  But it's because the spirit shines out through the genetics and manifests in that.
[00:30:15.178 --> 00:30:16.980]  That's the enemy's top general?
[00:30:18.882 --> 00:30:19.703]  That's a slave.
[00:30:25.285 --> 00:30:26.086]  And look at this woman.
[00:30:26.446 --> 00:30:26.706]  L.A.
[00:30:27.046 --> 00:30:31.089]  Public Health Director caught on tape saying schools will stay shut until after the election.
[00:30:31.109 --> 00:30:31.950]  Well, of course they will.
[00:30:34.752 --> 00:30:39.335]  Let's go ahead and play a clip of her saying that to KTLA.
[00:30:39.375 --> 00:30:39.916]  God, here it is.
[00:30:41.698 --> 00:30:48.063]  Now you can type in her name, Barbara Ferrer, F-E-R-R-E-R, and the photos are so horrific.
[00:30:48.723 --> 00:30:53.026]  I mean, she looks like my grandmother's dead body at 92.
[00:31:16.201 --> 00:31:20.624]  And Snope says she looks like Meryl Monroe.
[00:31:22.465 --> 00:31:31.472]  Now imagine that level of gaslighting that they say Getty's photos are fake.
[00:31:33.004 --> 00:31:36.548]  And all we're saying is, why do all these health directors... There's a real photo of her.
[00:31:37.049 --> 00:31:38.510]  That's a real photo of the L.A.
[00:31:38.570 --> 00:31:39.832]  health director, Barbara Farrer.
[00:31:40.232 --> 00:31:41.674]  And then that's what James Woods did.
[00:31:42.314 --> 00:31:44.997]  James Woods then morphs it and turns... What a horrible person.
[00:31:45.478 --> 00:31:48.381]  No, no, the truth is, ladies and gentlemen, that's a real video still.
[00:31:48.922 --> 00:31:49.762]  That James Woods put up.
[00:31:51.124 --> 00:31:51.965]  That's what she looks like!
[00:31:55.034 --> 00:31:58.777]  I mean, you wouldn't take advice from her about a car, about medicine.
[00:31:59.198 --> 00:32:00.379]  You wouldn't take advice from her.
[00:32:00.499 --> 00:32:02.221]  You'd say, damn lady, are you okay?
[00:32:02.241 --> 00:32:04.142]  Are you stage four terminal cancer?
[00:32:04.162 --> 00:32:14.311]  I mean, I've seen a lot of my dead family laying there when they're dead.
[00:32:15.307 --> 00:32:17.089]  And she looks worse than all of them.
[00:32:17.649 --> 00:32:18.230]  The very worst.
[00:32:18.530 --> 00:32:21.993]  She looks worse than all the dead bodies I've ever seen.
[00:32:22.674 --> 00:32:27.678]  And the reason I'm obsessing over this is, they're telling you, look at her, she's beautiful!
[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:37.727]  And then people go around and they look at all the other health department photos of these people, and they almost all look like they came from some type of Hellraiser dimension.
[00:32:42.443 --> 00:32:46.945]  And it's because, folks, these are the types of garbage that want to force-inoculate you.
[00:32:46.965 --> 00:32:49.207]  These are the types of garbage that Soros puts in.
[00:32:49.467 --> 00:32:51.308]  He didn't just put in district attorneys all over the country.
[00:32:51.528 --> 00:32:52.829]  He put these people in.
[00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:54.830]  This is who Bill Gates puts in.
[00:32:58.952 --> 00:32:59.812]  And they're coming for you.
[00:33:01.393 --> 00:33:03.574]  Because they're already dead inside and they want you to die now.
[00:33:04.915 --> 00:33:06.016]  They want to stick it in you.
[00:33:06.656 --> 00:33:10.138]  They want to stick their metal proboscis into your body.
[00:33:11.710 --> 00:33:17.253]  Attack your DNA and turn off your eighth chromosome so you can join them.
[00:33:19.154 --> 00:33:20.274]  Join their God.
[00:33:22.155 --> 00:33:23.516]  We are back live, my friends.
[00:33:24.156 --> 00:33:27.818]  I am your host, Alex Jones, as old Kenny Rogers brings us in.
[00:33:31.199 --> 00:33:34.041]  All right, I've only covered one stack of news.
[00:33:35.161 --> 00:33:37.542]  I'd even cover all of that stack, but it's the biggest stack.
[00:33:39.283 --> 00:33:39.903]  Let me do this.
[00:33:40.384 --> 00:33:40.744]  Let me
[00:33:44.431 --> 00:33:48.955]  Let me get into the pedophile stuff, even though I don't want to, and I know you don't want to hear this either, but we have to do it.
[00:33:51.958 --> 00:33:56.321]  Because they want to slowly bring this out and desensitize us so that we just give in to it.
[00:33:56.402 --> 00:34:02.827]  Instead, we need to get enraged, angry, focused, and expose them and use the pain to save these children.
[00:34:04.008 --> 00:34:09.673]  Because believe me, I could study 10 hours a day and not know one-tenth of what's going on.
[00:34:09.733 --> 00:34:10.414]  It's so massive.
[00:34:10.454 --> 00:34:11.114]  I mean, it's just...
[00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:14.230]  It's the total satanic takeover.
[00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:15.170]  Of course they want our children.
[00:34:15.690 --> 00:34:16.631]  Of course they want our future.
[00:34:17.051 --> 00:34:20.152]  Of course that's what these demons want to target.
[00:34:21.573 --> 00:34:22.873]  And it's a satanic invasion.
[00:34:25.034 --> 00:34:25.614]  And I get it.
[00:34:26.134 --> 00:34:30.736]  It makes me want to run to a farm somewhere and try to buy 100 acres and just never leave it.
[00:34:31.196 --> 00:34:32.617]  They're going to come to your farm, folks.
[00:34:34.017 --> 00:34:34.938]  You're not going to get away.
[00:34:36.048 --> 00:34:38.129]  Believe me, I know what you're thinking because I'm thinking the exact same thing.
[00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.789]  I'm not judging you.
[00:34:39.529 --> 00:34:40.629]  You think I want to be on air?
[00:34:40.829 --> 00:34:42.329]  You think I want to sit around in Austin, Texas?
[00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:43.710]  You think I want to fight these people?
[00:34:44.550 --> 00:34:45.730]  I want to be away from them.
[00:34:47.491 --> 00:34:48.451]  But that's not how it works.
[00:34:48.711 --> 00:34:50.231]  You know, we're supposed to be like Christ.
[00:34:50.951 --> 00:34:52.832]  Not comparing ourselves to Christ, but be Christ-like.
[00:34:52.872 --> 00:35:00.434]  You think Christ wanted to beam into the middle of all that and then be tortured and go through all that hell and take on all the sins and do something we couldn't even imagine?
[00:35:00.474 --> 00:35:01.994]  No, we have to be Christ-like.
[00:35:02.935 --> 00:35:10.438]  And so, you know, I almost want to apologize getting into this on air, but it has to be done.
[00:35:10.458 --> 00:35:15.099]  And again, we have a lot of great TV affiliates pick us up and radio stations.
[00:35:15.159 --> 00:35:27.884]  And a couple of years ago, they would call up the affiliate director, John Harmon, and Scott Bronson, and they'd say, hey, you really can't read that police report on air.
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.661]  That's not for even adult audiences.
[00:35:31.361 --> 00:35:35.563]  And I would instruct them to say, oh yeah, Mr. Jones agrees, but this is happening to children.
[00:35:37.744 --> 00:35:38.465]  And people kind of got it.
[00:35:38.485 --> 00:35:39.545]  They're like, yeah, I guess.
[00:35:40.366 --> 00:35:46.609]  I mean, we were, we show videos of drag queen pedophile time where men have glitter on their genitals.
[00:35:46.629 --> 00:35:51.831]  You know, the stations call up and they go, can you just not say penis?
[00:35:52.111 --> 00:35:53.132]  You think I want to say that?
[00:35:54.087 --> 00:36:02.349]  You think I want to look at a guy in Austin with huge genitals, with glitter on it, with little kids hugging him?
[00:36:02.529 --> 00:36:03.969]  It's pedophilia out in the open!
[00:36:04.409 --> 00:36:05.189]  I got children!
[00:36:05.309 --> 00:36:06.150]  You think I like that?
[00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:09.650]  I get it!
[00:36:10.251 --> 00:36:11.211]  It shouldn't be on air.
[00:36:15.252 --> 00:36:16.492]  I shouldn't air what I'm about to air.
[00:36:19.104 --> 00:36:20.165]  But I should, shouldn't I?
[00:36:20.966 --> 00:36:23.408]  Because if adults, they know what they're doing.
[00:36:23.889 --> 00:36:24.829]  The psychologists know.
[00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:28.133]  If adults, they can make us just give up and go, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:36:31.138 --> 00:36:32.398]  Then they've got the feel, don't they?
[00:36:33.299 --> 00:36:47.862]  If they can run us off because we're scared to engage and face what they're doing, well how do you expect the cops to go in and get all the snuff film videos and watch them and then go track down who did it and then bring it forward and then deal with the powerful people behind the folks that are doing all this?
[00:36:48.403 --> 00:36:52.604]  How do you expect the cops to watch this stuff that's a hundred times worse than I'm about to show you?
[00:36:53.704 --> 00:36:56.765]  When the pedophiles and the perverts are on
[00:36:57.705 --> 00:37:02.207]  TV at city councils saying we're gonna get your kids, we're grooming them.
[00:37:03.868 --> 00:37:07.030]  So I'm not up here lecturing our listeners or viewers or TV stations.
[00:37:07.510 --> 00:37:08.771]  I am torn by this as well.
[00:37:09.031 --> 00:37:20.177]  But I think we've all come to the consensus that we have to face this, no matter how horrible it is.
[00:37:21.479 --> 00:37:24.860]  Don't just stick a gun in your head and get out of here and leave the children.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:25.100]  No.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:26.740]  Fight these monsters.
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.361]  Don't commit suicide.
[00:37:28.441 --> 00:37:29.021]  Don't give up.
[00:37:29.261 --> 00:37:32.462]  Don't let their evil demoralize you and make you give up.
[00:37:33.102 --> 00:37:35.362]  Use that and say, God, I need you.
[00:37:35.462 --> 00:37:36.342]  I'm not strong enough.
[00:37:36.442 --> 00:37:37.683]  And God will give you the power.
[00:37:37.743 --> 00:37:38.203]  Don't worry.
[00:37:41.624 --> 00:37:42.724]  But careful what you ask for.
[00:37:42.744 --> 00:37:47.305]  Because with great knowledge comes great sorrow.
[00:37:50.043 --> 00:37:54.465]  You know, I could play you like 10 clips of them saying they're going to groom our kids on TV and giggling about it.
[00:38:00.087 --> 00:38:01.507]  We're going to get to it here in just a moment.
[00:38:03.508 --> 00:38:07.509]  All the media saying, oh, the virtuous pedophiles are such good people.
[00:38:07.849 --> 00:38:09.250]  They just love children.
[00:38:09.270 --> 00:38:17.233]  And it comes out in national, international news that they place tens of thousands of children with pedophiles.
[00:38:18.188 --> 00:38:19.771]  Taken from good family homes?
[00:38:21.574 --> 00:38:28.506]  Because the German pedophile network run by the Socialist Party and by Merkel's National Democrat Party
[00:38:32.384 --> 00:38:36.407]  Said, the ultimate love is an adult having sex with a child.
[00:38:37.127 --> 00:38:40.209]  And we'll form a new family with adults having sex with children.
[00:38:40.649 --> 00:38:41.850]  What the hell?
[00:38:42.210 --> 00:38:43.431]  That's in Der Spiegel.
[00:38:44.011 --> 00:38:45.472]  That's in DW.com.
[00:38:45.512 --> 00:38:47.033]  That's on national TV.
[00:38:47.333 --> 00:38:50.195]  And it's just a story once or twice, and you never hear about it again.
[00:38:50.515 --> 00:38:53.457]  Industrial level, child protective services.
[00:39:01.661 --> 00:39:03.462]  Feeding children to pedophiles.
[00:39:03.502 --> 00:39:05.484]  And that's just one big story.
[00:39:06.845 --> 00:39:09.246]  And I knew the tactics, you know, three, four months ago when that first broke.
[00:39:09.266 --> 00:39:15.610]  Talked about one psychiatrist in Berlin handing hundreds of children over to dozens of pedophiles.
[00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:16.811]  And I said, that's one guy.
[00:39:17.131 --> 00:39:17.552]  You watch.
[00:39:17.632 --> 00:39:20.073]  It's a nationwide, international network.
[00:39:20.354 --> 00:39:21.494]  It'll be tens of thousands.
[00:39:21.775 --> 00:39:29.420]  And it came out a week later, 30,000 children placed with rapists as young as three years of age.
[00:39:30.486 --> 00:39:30.886]  Excuse me.
[00:39:31.246 --> 00:39:31.987]  Two years of age.
[00:39:33.827 --> 00:39:34.267]  There it is.
[00:39:34.768 --> 00:39:37.749]  Police in Germany investigate 30,000 potential suspects in a pedophile probe.
[00:39:37.929 --> 00:39:39.009]  And then it got worse than that.
[00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:42.050]  So what I'm telling you is you can't hide.
[00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:43.491]  This is a religion.
[00:39:45.475 --> 00:39:54.822]  And remember, roughly half the children that get raped turn into pedophiles, or something that is close to it, or at least collaborators with it.
[00:39:55.182 --> 00:39:58.464]  So, again, vampires aren't real, but the spirit is real.
[00:39:58.985 --> 00:40:01.567]  How does a vampire make more vampires?
[00:40:01.607 --> 00:40:02.467]  It doesn't have babies.
[00:40:03.268 --> 00:40:05.890]  It infects someone with the spiritual evil.
[00:40:07.011 --> 00:40:12.675]  And that's how they're rising up, and they've built this huge army of pedophiles, and they want more!
[00:40:15.469 --> 00:40:16.990]  They want to destroy the family.
[00:40:18.051 --> 00:40:19.512]  They want to drug your children.
[00:40:20.112 --> 00:40:21.553]  They want to sterilize your boys.
[00:40:21.893 --> 00:40:23.935]  They want to destroy creation.
[00:40:24.615 --> 00:40:25.916]  Because they hate God's creation.
[00:40:28.738 --> 00:40:31.420]  I'll tell you what, I'll start the next hour and I'll play these clips and I'll get into it.
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.681]  Viewer discretion is advised.
[00:40:33.041 --> 00:40:34.122]  Just remember this separately.
[00:40:35.558 --> 00:40:37.259]  The supply chains are breaking down worldwide.
[00:40:37.299 --> 00:40:39.360]  The third world is starving at double the rate they were.
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:43.042]  China's buying up all the commodities and refusing to ship them, which is fine.
[00:40:43.062 --> 00:40:43.903]  Theirs is so tainted.
[00:40:44.283 --> 00:40:45.904]  But major supply chains are breaking down.
[00:40:46.404 --> 00:40:47.485]  Food lines are starting.
[00:40:47.645 --> 00:40:48.845]  Food shortages are beginning.
[00:40:49.406 --> 00:40:51.827]  A lot of farms were unable to produce, ready to destroy what they had.
[00:40:52.187 --> 00:40:53.248]  Reserves are running out.
[00:40:53.868 --> 00:40:55.089]  And I believe
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:41:01.063]  That you will end up seeing major runs on food, if not late this year, early next year.
[00:41:01.363 --> 00:41:11.189]  But regardless of all the craziness in the world today, and all the destabilization you see, I think one of the smartest things for me to recommend to yourself, and everybody else, is high quality, affordable food.
[00:41:11.209 --> 00:41:13.550]  So we have the biggest affordable food company in the United States.
[00:41:13.991 --> 00:41:15.191]  They're only 13 years old.
[00:41:15.872 --> 00:41:19.694]  They became the biggest within five years because of quality and the lowest prices.
[00:41:20.355 --> 00:41:23.416]  Can you find stuff that's even more gourmet, that costs four or five times more?
[00:41:23.577 --> 00:41:24.137]  Absolutely.
[00:41:25.512 --> 00:41:26.653]  Literally four or five times more.
[00:41:26.693 --> 00:41:28.715]  This is like a third of what the grocery store cost.
[00:41:29.536 --> 00:41:30.737]  And it's really good.
[00:41:30.777 --> 00:41:31.778]  Some of it tastes amazing.
[00:41:31.838 --> 00:41:32.458]  It's really delicious.
[00:41:32.478 --> 00:41:33.179]  Some of it's okay.
[00:41:33.479 --> 00:41:34.480]  But it lasts 25 years.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.481]  The packaging is amazing.
[00:41:35.521 --> 00:41:36.883]  It's what I've chosen for my family.
[00:41:37.123 --> 00:41:38.064]  The biggest bang for the buck.
[00:41:38.424 --> 00:41:39.765]  And I bought it for family as well.
[00:41:39.945 --> 00:41:40.366]  I have bought...
[00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:47.049]  More than 10 one-year supplies from the same group in the last 10 years.
[00:41:47.450 --> 00:41:49.371]  And when it gets like five years old, it's still perfectly good.
[00:41:49.391 --> 00:41:53.433]  I just give it to the homeless shelter, give it to family, and it's still all completely good.
[00:41:53.533 --> 00:41:59.055]  And I personally have a three-year food supply for my family right now in my attic and in my garage.
[00:42:00.016 --> 00:42:04.758]  And I'm probably going to go ahead and just buy more because it's a checkbox you've got to check off.
[00:42:04.778 --> 00:42:08.480]  But whether it's a month you get, three months, six months, they have specialty foods, all of it.
[00:42:09.827 --> 00:42:16.750]  I would get your orders in at InfoWarsTore.com right now, ladies and gentlemen, because there's only one to two-week waits now.
[00:42:16.810 --> 00:42:18.571]  It's fresh-packed right now.
[00:42:18.591 --> 00:42:20.412]  I mean, really, they're shipping in, like, four or five days on average.
[00:42:20.432 --> 00:42:21.673]  They said Alex should stay one to two weeks.
[00:42:22.453 --> 00:42:25.595]  And you get it, and you got it, and it's got these great tote containers.
[00:42:26.854 --> 00:42:31.396]  That if you go to Walmart or someone trying to buy plastic containers, they cost as much as this does with the food in it.
[00:42:31.856 --> 00:42:38.138]  With the markup, it's the same nice big latches and plastic tops and sealed and then great containers inside.
[00:42:38.178 --> 00:42:42.640]  And believe me, portability, mobility, packaging is very important.
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:58.320]  It's secondary to what's in it, but if it doesn't last and it's not contained and it's not something you just throw in the back of a pickup truck in a rainstorm, bury if you need to, just make sure it's not at the water table because it could still seep in, but if it's above the water table, say, like there's a hill on your property, you can bury it up in that.
[00:42:59.888 --> 00:43:03.150]  It's, it's, it's, or you know, in a barn, have a false floor, whatever.
[00:43:03.630 --> 00:43:07.212]  The point is, is that, um, hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
[00:43:07.272 --> 00:43:09.853]  I'll get your orders in now ahead of this election.
[00:43:10.173 --> 00:43:12.454]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:43:12.514 --> 00:43:16.716]  We've got some great new products we've launched too at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:43:16.756 --> 00:43:26.401]  That's my dad's new company and it's got the activated charcoal toothpaste and mouthwash and a bunch of other great products like Rocket Rest and others at drjonesnaturals.com.
[00:43:28.490 --> 00:43:31.892]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[00:43:31.912 --> 00:43:33.073]  They're going to contest the election.
[00:43:33.313 --> 00:43:34.474]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[00:43:34.794 --> 00:43:36.195]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[00:43:36.295 --> 00:43:37.296]  I want them shut down.
[00:43:37.376 --> 00:43:38.276]  I want them silenced.
[00:43:38.316 --> 00:43:39.117]  I want them muted.
[00:43:39.157 --> 00:43:40.938]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:43:40.978 --> 00:43:41.919]  You kept us on air.
[00:43:42.039 --> 00:43:43.340]  We did the analysis first.
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:44.600]  It's now gone mainstream.
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:46.482]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[00:43:46.762 --> 00:43:52.646]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[00:43:53.206 --> 00:43:54.287]  You need to stop right now.
[00:43:54.387 --> 00:43:55.468]  And they're very, very serious.
[00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:57.971]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[00:43:58.071 --> 00:43:58.912]  It's not gonna happen.
[00:43:58.932 --> 00:44:00.854]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[00:44:01.295 --> 00:44:03.757]  I used to say, support InfoWars, rescue InfoWars.
[00:44:03.837 --> 00:44:05.479]  Save yourself, save the world.
[00:44:05.799 --> 00:44:06.660]  We're in this together.
[00:44:07.001 --> 00:44:07.781]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:44:08.402 --> 00:44:09.383]  Communism's up here.
[00:44:09.583 --> 00:44:12.545]  Infowars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[00:44:12.945 --> 00:44:14.746]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[00:44:14.967 --> 00:44:16.508]  My children are right here!
[00:44:17.228 --> 00:44:18.969]  But I need money to fight a war!
[00:44:19.189 --> 00:44:20.230]  And I need word of mouth!
[00:44:20.450 --> 00:44:21.351]  And I need prayer!
[00:44:21.491 --> 00:44:22.452]  And I need action!
[00:44:22.852 --> 00:44:24.413]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[00:44:25.134 --> 00:44:27.115]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[00:44:28.076 --> 00:44:35.561]  Alright, I'm gonna come back and get into this religion of the anti-human Satanist next segment, and then a lot more.
[00:44:36.601 --> 00:44:42.964]  But, Gregg Reese has done it again with another powerful report, Freedom vs. Tyranny 2020.
[00:44:43.104 --> 00:44:45.224]  It's in the Gregg Reese section of Band.Video.
[00:44:45.585 --> 00:44:52.147]  Band.Video is working well today because last time I checked, the Communist Chinese have not launched giant, you know, hack attacks.
[00:44:52.187 --> 00:44:54.308]  I guess they only went five days this time in the attack.
[00:44:54.788 --> 00:44:57.069]  So you can share that video now while you still can.
[00:44:57.489 --> 00:44:58.370]  So here is the report.
[00:45:17.366 --> 00:45:18.808]  It's a peaceful protest.
[00:45:18.868 --> 00:45:20.030]  It's scarier than it looks.
[00:45:27.911 --> 00:45:28.772]  Kill the police.
[00:45:29.052 --> 00:45:30.392]  Death to America.
[00:45:30.933 --> 00:45:31.953]  That's not Iran.
[00:45:32.493 --> 00:45:32.974]  It's Wisconsin.
[00:45:33.174 --> 00:45:36.696]  It could have been a dozen other places in this country.
[00:45:36.836 --> 00:45:40.318]  The violence has been building unabated for three months now.
[00:45:40.398 --> 00:45:43.979]  By some accounts, 30 Americans have died so far in these riots.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:50.663]  Five days into the first Minneapolis riots in May, as the city burned live on camera before everyone.
[00:45:50.803 --> 00:45:53.885]  Former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley took to Twitter to support the rioters.
[00:45:53.945 --> 00:45:56.706]  Quote, it's important to understand that the death
[00:45:59.454 --> 00:46:04.761]  Many, Hailey wrote, in order to heal, it needs to be personal and painful for everyone.
[00:46:04.821 --> 00:46:09.166]  People are taken to the streets, and I support them.
[00:46:09.206 --> 00:46:13.592]  How shocked are we that 17-year-olds with rifles decided they had to maintain order?
[00:46:18.507 --> 00:46:24.271]  The first George Floyd protest of Memorial Day has reached its inevitable and bloody conclusion.
[00:46:24.311 --> 00:46:27.934]  Last night, three people were shot on the streets of Kenosha, Wisconsin.
[00:46:27.954 --> 00:46:29.395]  Two of them have died.
[00:46:29.435 --> 00:46:39.383]  There was a shot that was fired as Kyle was retreating, actually, from a mob that had become enraged that he was trying to put out fires that the arsonists had set.
[00:46:39.423 --> 00:46:40.664]  The mob became enraged.
[00:46:40.744 --> 00:46:42.606]  They started relentlessly hunting him.
[00:46:42.966 --> 00:46:45.628]  A shot was fired from behind him.
[00:46:46.128 --> 00:46:50.794]  Once Kyle was running away, immediately, the guy chasing him is now the aggressor.
[00:46:50.954 --> 00:46:57.921]  The individual, Mr. Rosenbaum, who was leading the attack on him, set upon him, immediately began to assault him from behind.
[00:46:58.002 --> 00:47:03.828]  The 17-year-old has been officially charged with two counts of homicide and one count of attempted homicide.
[00:47:35.862 --> 00:47:43.406]  But in at least two of the shootings, video shows Rittenhouse running away, being attacked, and then firing.
[00:47:43.446 --> 00:47:47.408]  At one point, a 17-year-old who's now been charged tried to run from the bomb.
[00:47:47.468 --> 00:47:49.689]  He tripped and fell in the middle of the street.
[00:47:49.729 --> 00:47:54.391]  A man ran up and smashed him in the head with a skateboard.
[00:48:05.638 --> 00:48:07.621]  And now a mob chase Caitlin Bennett.
[00:48:07.641 --> 00:48:10.625]  Human beings crave orders, prerequisite for life.
[00:48:10.685 --> 00:48:12.087]  They fear uncertainty above all.
[00:48:12.187 --> 00:48:16.433]  People will trade virtually anything for relief from chaos.
[00:48:16.473 --> 00:48:17.595]  That's a fact of human nature.
[00:48:17.675 --> 00:48:18.656]  It's always true.
[00:48:18.877 --> 00:48:22.682]  Our cities are burning because the people in charge have allowed them to burn.
[00:48:22.922 --> 00:48:27.064]  But let's be honest, the Justice Department could have stopped all of this months ago.
[00:48:27.164 --> 00:48:36.428]  If federal prosecutors had treated the organizers of BLM and Antifa the way they treated Roger Stone, our cities wouldn't look like Kosovo tonight.
[00:48:36.468 --> 00:48:39.069]  What you're watching is an effort by the academic left
[00:48:54.708 --> 00:48:55.368]  Absolutely.
[00:48:55.388 --> 00:48:56.969]  We'll be right back, folks.
[00:48:56.989 --> 00:48:57.470]  Stay with us.
[00:48:58.951 --> 00:48:59.511]  We are back!
[00:49:00.852 --> 00:49:03.073]  I really appreciate you all for tuning in on this live Friday edition.
[00:49:03.093 --> 00:49:04.254]  What an incredible time to be live.
[00:49:04.794 --> 00:49:06.715]  All of us together, conscious on this planet.
[00:49:07.396 --> 00:49:08.356]  It's beyond amazing.
[00:49:08.717 --> 00:49:09.337]  It's reality.
[00:49:13.985 --> 00:49:15.305]  On the road again.
[00:49:16.966 --> 00:49:19.486]  Here I am, up on the stage.
[00:49:20.286 --> 00:49:21.086]  All right, let's get into it.
[00:49:23.607 --> 00:49:31.128]  So, Netflix has a whole bunch of pedophilic shows, just like Vice does and HBO and the New York Times are saying it's a good thing.
[00:49:31.188 --> 00:49:39.509]  And the German government has just had a huge program with 30,000 children being handed over to convicted pedophiles that live with them to create the beautiful Nambla love.
[00:49:40.810 --> 00:49:42.550]  And so people are finding out about this and going, man,
[00:49:45.319 --> 00:49:45.999]  How could this be?
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:59.549]  So they distract off onto cuties, which is 10, 11-year-old girls sexually shaking their asses in front of full-grown men and breaking into buildings and committing crimes and promoting communism, and I mean, it's a pedophilic program.
[00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:10.957]  But it's a distraction from the real shows they've got that are like, you know, men dressed as women having sex with 10-year-old children, going, hey, I'm going to go in there and have sex, and it's real.
[00:50:13.592 --> 00:50:18.216]  Now on the IMDB, they say, hey, this show depicts things defined as pedophilia.
[00:50:19.016 --> 00:50:20.097]  They want you to know that.
[00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:27.764]  And then the head of it comes out and says, oh no, this fights the sexualization of children.
[00:50:27.984 --> 00:50:33.088]  Kind of like Nike and Lululemon having slave camps in China fights slave camps, right?
[00:50:33.568 --> 00:50:38.272]  Or Tim Cook gives money to Black Lives Matter while they have some of the worst slave camps in China.
[00:50:40.254 --> 00:50:42.516]  It's all just sick, evil virtues signaling
[00:50:44.718 --> 00:50:46.119]  To distract you from what they're really doing.
[00:50:46.159 --> 00:50:47.220]  So, videos!
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:48.121]  I'm not going to show these.
[00:50:48.561 --> 00:50:52.964]  Child actors in Netflix cuties are even more sexualized than conservatives feared.
[00:50:53.024 --> 00:51:05.754]  Yeah, it's, it's very risque with, you know, I mean, I'm 46 and I would not choose to take my wife to something like this if adult women were doing this.
[00:51:06.134 --> 00:51:08.536]  I mean, if my wife's like, what are you doing taking me to a Vegas show?
[00:51:08.556 --> 00:51:08.956]  What's going on?
[00:51:08.976 --> 00:51:10.998]  What are you doing taking me to a topless bar?
[00:51:11.018 --> 00:51:11.618]  Some people want to do that.
[00:51:11.658 --> 00:51:12.619]  You're adults, do whatever you want.
[00:51:13.199 --> 00:51:14.080]  The point is, is that
[00:51:16.175 --> 00:51:17.296]  It usually causes a problem.
[00:51:18.458 --> 00:51:19.579]  This is children.
[00:51:22.682 --> 00:51:25.445]  And then here's just the stacks of news I have today without even looking.
[00:51:25.626 --> 00:51:28.729]  Oklahoma man wanted for sexually assaulting baby on video.
[00:51:29.189 --> 00:51:31.412]  Arrested in San Marcos, Texas, south of Austin.
[00:51:32.493 --> 00:51:33.434]  CBS News Austin.
[00:51:34.369 --> 00:51:49.557]  Bryce Gage Watkins was arrested by Lone Star Fugitive Task Force in San Marcos for reportedly sexually assaulting a six-month-old baby and raping the baby on video and putting it on social media and getting love and likes from all the liberals.
[00:51:51.598 --> 00:51:58.001]  Facebook allows reported baby rapists to keep account but they banned Kyle Rittenhouse.
[00:51:58.161 --> 00:51:59.282]  Oh yeah, this is the club.
[00:52:01.647 --> 00:52:07.211]  There's nothing cooler to these people than destroying innocents and hurting somebody that's innocent.
[00:52:09.973 --> 00:52:10.314]  There it is.
[00:52:10.354 --> 00:52:14.197]  Netflix breaks silence on cuties after massive backlash over sexualization of children.
[00:52:14.457 --> 00:52:16.198]  The Fens movie is a powerful story.
[00:52:16.919 --> 00:52:21.162]  Cuties is a story and a social commentary against the sexualization of young children.
[00:52:22.603 --> 00:52:24.785]  Hitler was pro-Jewish.
[00:52:26.066 --> 00:52:27.347]  Stalin was pro-capitalist.
[00:52:28.147 --> 00:52:28.748]  That's what they're saying.
[00:52:34.994 --> 00:52:37.054]  That's where these people are coming from.
[00:52:37.995 --> 00:52:38.635]  It's who they are.
[00:52:38.655 --> 00:52:39.815]  Of course, I'm being satirical.
[00:52:39.855 --> 00:52:43.596]  Hitler did not like Jews and Stalin did not like capitalism.
[00:52:44.496 --> 00:52:48.196]  Cuties is a social commentary against the sexualization of children.
[00:52:49.697 --> 00:52:51.637]  I watched as much as I could, five minutes of it.
[00:52:51.677 --> 00:52:52.417]  It was horrible.
[00:52:52.937 --> 00:52:58.338]  But it was the tip of the iceberg compared to what goes on with pedophile story time at your local school.
[00:52:59.139 --> 00:53:00.819]  But seeing an interviewed Netflix CEO
[00:53:01.943 --> 00:53:04.804]  And Phil to ask one question about Cuties or all the other shows.
[00:53:04.824 --> 00:53:08.325]  Meanwhile, Cuties promotes the Hammer and Sickle iconography.
[00:53:08.965 --> 00:53:09.725]  But that's okay.
[00:53:11.026 --> 00:53:18.888]  Athletic apparel company Lululemon sponsors Decolonizing Gender, Resist Capitalism, Bring Down America workshops.
[00:53:20.489 --> 00:53:21.669]  Even though, you look it up,
[00:53:24.141 --> 00:53:32.027]  They make almost all their apparel and sweatshops and slave labor in Communist China and other hell holes.
[00:53:32.047 --> 00:53:34.829]  3% of its production is in North America.
[00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:45.337]  But it's okay, because they got a mulatto lady on the front, so... Nice pretty woman, so everything's okay.
[00:53:45.357 --> 00:53:53.523]  They don't... They're gonna unveil the historical badness of America, but not the current slave camps in China.
[00:53:55.481 --> 00:53:56.281]  See how that works?
[00:53:58.663 --> 00:54:05.666]  As long as you're fighting William Jefferson Davis from 160 years ago, you're fine.
[00:54:07.307 --> 00:54:12.749]  But you don't fight Guther Northam in his blackface or his KKK outfit when he keeps your baby comfortable.
[00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:17.612]  And they take the organs and the blood and the skin.
[00:54:18.912 --> 00:54:20.673]  But then it's all liberal, so it's okay.
[00:54:21.253 --> 00:54:22.694]  So let's go ahead and roll part of this.
[00:54:23.674 --> 00:54:24.235]  This is, uh,
[00:54:25.563 --> 00:54:28.946]  An actress and she's married to the Deadpool guy who's actually a pretty good actor.
[00:54:30.647 --> 00:54:32.288]  And I never paid any attention to Blake.
[00:54:36.031 --> 00:54:36.431]  Lively.
[00:54:38.553 --> 00:54:40.354]  But now I do because the actress
[00:54:41.621 --> 00:54:44.363]  An awards program got into what's really going on.
[00:54:44.423 --> 00:54:45.224]  It's hard to hear this.
[00:54:45.904 --> 00:54:47.866]  It's hard to see this, but this is what needs to come out.
[00:54:47.886 --> 00:54:49.327]  And this is what law enforcement told her.
[00:54:49.627 --> 00:54:50.948]  And I can tell you, this is what goes on.
[00:54:50.968 --> 00:54:56.252]  I just showed you CBS News, this happening in Austin and other places just today.
[00:54:56.272 --> 00:55:00.516]  Because the trendy thing to do is to rape a baby.
[00:55:02.718 --> 00:55:04.499]  Here is her breakdown of it.
[00:55:05.923 --> 00:55:08.124]  ...of boys and girls under the age of 18.
[00:55:08.164 --> 00:55:13.626]  But now, because of high-speed internet, it's also videos, very prominently.
[00:55:14.226 --> 00:55:19.228]  And videos of kids, and by kids I mean pre-pubescent, visibly pre-pubescent.
[00:55:19.688 --> 00:55:28.532]  And they make the distinction because of the internet and there's so much content, these pedophiles are desensitized.
[00:55:29.212 --> 00:55:34.574]  Because of that, the kids are getting younger, and the content is getting that much more devastating.
[00:55:35.925 --> 00:55:44.414]  So when this law enforcement officer told me this, I asked him how young are the young kids he's seeing, and he told me infants.
[00:55:46.296 --> 00:55:48.378]  And I have a six-month-old baby.
[00:55:48.838 --> 00:55:50.420]  So I said, what does that mean, you know?
[00:55:50.460 --> 00:55:51.862]  Like, what does an infant mean?
[00:55:51.882 --> 00:55:54.064]  And he said, with the umbilical cord still attached.
[00:55:55.649 --> 00:56:10.912]  I know it's so devastating to hear this and I'm really sorry to share this but I'm grateful that you guys are listening because this is actually happening and it's important that we know this and that it resonates with us so that we think about this in our days and in our personal life.
[00:56:11.753 --> 00:56:27.304]  Um, so I asked them what happens in these videos and, you know, unspeakable things happen, but I'm, again, going to speak about them because I feel like if these kids are experiencing this, the least that they deserve is for us to hear what is actually happening to them.
[00:56:28.464 --> 00:56:30.344]  So, no, it's not just touching.
[00:56:30.404 --> 00:56:32.125]  There is penetration.
[00:56:33.245 --> 00:56:35.985]  There is extreme torture and bondage.
[00:56:36.265 --> 00:56:40.846]  There is bestiality, which is having an animal penetrate the child or infant.
[00:56:41.846 --> 00:56:42.907]  There is incest.
[00:56:42.947 --> 00:56:48.188]  I mean, they said, you think of it, anything you can think of, it's out there and it's being traded.
[00:56:48.328 --> 00:56:52.728]  And it's 30 to 50 million files a day being traded that we know of.
[00:56:53.208 --> 00:56:55.189]  I mean, you can see what's happening right now.
[00:56:56.489 --> 00:56:59.251]  And this is happening to any child and every child.
[00:56:59.732 --> 00:57:02.774]  You know, 90% of children know they're abusers.
[00:57:03.234 --> 00:57:05.876]  So, you know, our children are at risk.
[00:57:05.976 --> 00:57:07.317]  You may know this person.
[00:57:07.337 --> 00:57:08.338]  It may be a doctor.
[00:57:08.378 --> 00:57:09.239]  It may be a coach.
[00:57:10.620 --> 00:57:17.585]  You know, I thought that people that were working with children were people that wanted to protect them.
[00:57:18.105 --> 00:57:25.331]  But oftentimes it's people who have this propensity for wanting to lower children.
[00:57:26.519 --> 00:57:30.100]  And now they just have Netflix shows where they go, here, I'm leading a kid into a dirty mattress.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:33.080]  He's 10, never met a 10-year-old top.
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:37.361]  That means that the 10-year-old boy is going to be having sex with the man dressed like a woman.
[00:57:39.001 --> 00:57:40.802]  And this is going on.
[00:57:41.022 --> 00:57:45.203]  This is celebrated, and that's why people in Hollywood that aren't part of it are speaking out against it.
[00:57:45.883 --> 00:57:47.483]  And so it's going on en masse.
[00:57:47.543 --> 00:57:52.544]  But their favorite thing is not just to rape babies.
[00:57:54.243 --> 00:57:55.725]  It's a black mess.
[00:57:56.005 --> 00:57:58.467]  They cut them up, they drink their blood, they kill them.
[00:57:59.528 --> 00:58:01.129]  So, that's who the Democrat Party are.
[00:58:01.169 --> 00:58:02.770]  Devil-worshipping, blood-drinking Satanists.
[00:58:02.790 --> 00:58:03.191]  Stay with us.
[00:58:04.432 --> 00:58:05.713]  This isn't a simulation.
[00:58:05.733 --> 00:58:07.234]  This isn't Hollywood.
[00:58:07.254 --> 00:58:09.716]  This is what Hollywood really is.
[00:58:09.736 --> 00:58:11.317]  This is who the Satanists really are.
[00:58:12.118 --> 00:58:13.880]  They greedily want control of the future.
[00:58:14.775 --> 00:58:17.597]  They want the souls and destinies and innocence of children.
[00:58:19.018 --> 00:58:24.863]  Here's a short compilation of some of the enemy, crawling from the rooftops that our children belonged to then.
[00:58:26.724 --> 00:58:33.549]  We are grooming the new generation of Americans to be fully embracing of diversity and inclusivity.
[00:58:58.507 --> 00:59:01.849]  I'm actually going to be one of the drag queens reading for Drag Queen Storytime.
[00:59:01.889 --> 00:59:03.150]  Drag Queen Storytime.
[00:59:03.470 --> 00:59:06.272]  Teach the children.
[00:59:06.292 --> 00:59:08.614]  Teach the children.
[00:59:08.774 --> 00:59:11.015]  I'm all about education.
[00:59:25.691 --> 00:59:26.051]  Are you nervous?
[00:59:26.071 --> 00:59:26.151]  Yes
[00:59:36.701 --> 00:59:37.441]  Do you want to touch my hair?
[00:59:37.781 --> 00:59:37.941]  No.
[00:59:38.281 --> 00:59:43.702]  And for the children and the people that support it are going to realize that this is going to be the grooming of the next generation.
[00:59:43.962 --> 00:59:49.283]  That's the whole goal is to make kids that aren't used to seeing something like me more comfortable to seeing it.
[00:59:49.623 --> 00:59:51.764]  Michael likes to twerk.
[00:59:52.084 --> 00:59:55.424]  Now does anybody in this room know how to twerk?
[00:59:55.785 --> 00:59:58.785]  Turn around and shake your butt!
[00:59:58.825 --> 01:00:00.065]  Shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em, shake em!
[01:00:00.165 --> 01:00:03.226]  It was a first for this branch of the public library too.
[01:00:12.370 --> 01:00:16.180]  The hips on the drag queen go swish swish swish.
[01:00:25.313 --> 01:00:31.335]  A lot of the core values of being a drag queen, love, acceptance, joy, laughter, self-expression, are values that we want to instill in our kids.
[01:00:31.355 --> 01:00:37.297]  So I think it's really important that we bring this program and we spread the joy of reading and the joy of just spreading love.
[01:00:58.291 --> 01:01:00.653]  And everywhere else it's called pedophilia.
[01:01:01.053 --> 01:01:08.219]  But when it's done institutionally, and they can get away with people dressed up like demon clowns with your children.
[01:01:08.279 --> 01:01:10.841]  Pull up Tranny Time in the New York schools.
[01:01:11.082 --> 01:01:13.023]  This was put out in the New York Times, like it's wonderful.
[01:01:13.223 --> 01:01:17.147]  And it's the biggest scary looking group of weirdo pot-bellied men.
[01:01:17.187 --> 01:01:22.031]  Looks like a bunch of Dennis Hasterds running around with clown makeup on.
[01:01:22.611 --> 01:01:28.514]  Just hopping around, rubbing their giant bellies in front of children, and you're like, what alternate universe is this?!
[01:01:29.075 --> 01:01:30.696]  What planet did I wake up in?!
[01:01:35.018 --> 01:01:37.660]  Alright, now, Dr. Steve McChinnick was on with us yesterday.
[01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:43.363]  He's gonna be joining us again, because I wanted to get him on about 9-11, and then we got into a bunch of other subjects, and we didn't, but we'll talk about who really...
[01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:45.235]  Did 9-11.
[01:01:45.336 --> 01:01:48.819]  We'll name names and just cut right to the heart of it.
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:52.564]  And Steve Mnuchin did run psychological operations in the State Department.
[01:01:53.064 --> 01:01:54.646]  He did run major CIA operations.
[01:01:54.686 --> 01:01:55.928]  He did overthrow governments.
[01:01:56.568 --> 01:01:59.952]  You just type in his name, you'll find Times of London articles about it.
[01:02:00.573 --> 01:02:03.036]  You know, Reuters, you name it, from back in the day, the stuff he did.
[01:02:04.284 --> 01:02:08.086]  So, when he tells you these names and the stuff that went on, I don't just believe him.
[01:02:08.766 --> 01:02:11.008]  I did my own research and know it to be very, very accurate.
[01:02:11.068 --> 01:02:13.129]  So, we're not saying there isn't radical Islam.
[01:02:13.149 --> 01:02:14.029]  We're not saying it's not a threat.
[01:02:14.530 --> 01:02:15.910]  It was involved as a cutout group.
[01:02:15.930 --> 01:02:20.613]  We're going to explain what happened there and now what they're doing with COVID-19 coming up next segment.
[01:02:20.653 --> 01:02:22.074]  But let's shift gears into this right now.
[01:02:24.375 --> 01:02:31.919]  I saw the footage of, and it's up on InfoWars.com and Band.Video, of Caitlin Bennett at a university.
[01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:39.140]  And the students start chasing her like zombies, like a zombie apocalypse.
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:41.141]  And it reminded me of Kyle Rittenhouse.
[01:02:42.742 --> 01:02:43.722]  And they were trying to assault her.
[01:02:44.323 --> 01:02:45.744]  So this is mob psychology.
[01:02:45.784 --> 01:02:47.165]  This is Maoist psychology.
[01:02:47.865 --> 01:02:50.347]  And so, you know, what happens at this point?
[01:02:51.047 --> 01:02:55.670]  Let's go ahead and roll the footage of Kyle Rittenhouse, then we'll roll the footage of Caitlyn Bennett last night.
[01:03:08.263 --> 01:03:15.748]  So, the mob acts the same at the University of Central Florida in Orlando, just like they act in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
[01:03:20.671 --> 01:03:23.233]  So let's roll a few minutes and take a minute and two.
[01:03:23.293 --> 01:03:24.574]  Holy f**k, bro!
[01:03:24.614 --> 01:03:26.916]  Oh, I thought we'd leave it.
[01:03:39.935 --> 01:03:55.099]  Let's just roll the footage then without the audio for TV viewers of them chasing her down and then trying to physically attack her to virtue signal because she's a Trump supporter and because she's a conservative.
[01:03:58.359 --> 01:04:00.101]  That they are just going to make their bones.
[01:04:00.141 --> 01:04:05.086]  They're going to attack people.
[01:04:06.107 --> 01:04:09.190]  And Kaitlin recounted all this with The War Room yesterday.
[01:04:09.210 --> 01:04:11.632]  It's up on Mandot Video.
[01:04:11.652 --> 01:04:17.798]  Kaitlin Bennett recounts being attacked by a psychotic mob at Central Florida University.
[01:04:18.885 --> 01:04:19.765]  And it goes on and on.
[01:04:20.846 --> 01:04:22.687]  Again, the crew does a great job.
[01:04:22.707 --> 01:04:24.707]  Just sometimes they get another version that isn't bleeped.
[01:04:25.048 --> 01:04:26.088]  And it takes a lot of bleeping.
[01:04:26.608 --> 01:04:28.429]  Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, because that's what they do.
[01:04:28.449 --> 01:04:32.271]  But imagine the craved nature of the left woke mob.
[01:04:34.451 --> 01:04:37.573]  And again, people go, well, why are you giving black folks a pass?
[01:04:37.593 --> 01:04:41.214]  Because there are a lot of black folks out doing racial attacks on whites with BLM.
[01:04:41.514 --> 01:04:42.055]  Absolutely.
[01:04:42.315 --> 01:04:44.936]  I'm saying in most of the videos, it's a pack of white people.
[01:04:46.417 --> 01:04:47.678]  Trying to virtue signal.
[01:04:48.038 --> 01:04:52.101]  And they do this weird thing where they go inward, inward, inward.
[01:04:52.501 --> 01:04:55.303]  And they go, I'm allowed to say it because I'm an ally.
[01:04:57.004 --> 01:04:58.205]  You're attacking journalists.
[01:04:58.225 --> 01:04:59.066]  You're attacking police.
[01:04:59.426 --> 01:05:01.588]  You're attacking the lowest level of society.
[01:05:03.462 --> 01:05:09.705]  And acting like you're fighting elites when the big money is the ones funding every damn bit of this.
[01:05:10.485 --> 01:05:12.446]  Folks, they plan to disrupt the election.
[01:05:12.506 --> 01:05:14.187]  They plan to try to overthrow Trump.
[01:05:14.227 --> 01:05:15.167]  They've said they're going to do it.
[01:05:15.527 --> 01:05:19.129]  They plan to have a great depression that they have a good chance of getting away with.
[01:05:20.610 --> 01:05:23.131]  If I was you, I'd be politically active right now.
[01:05:23.531 --> 01:05:26.232]  I'd also get high quality, affordable food and water filtration.
[01:05:26.592 --> 01:05:28.093]  We have the very best water filtration.
[01:05:29.363 --> 01:05:31.945]  The very best, high-quality, store-able foods at m4store.com.
[01:05:32.125 --> 01:05:33.927]  And I don't normally hype food.
[01:05:33.987 --> 01:05:35.848]  Food's something everybody should have a little bit of, a backup.
[01:05:35.888 --> 01:05:36.249]  It's great.
[01:05:36.489 --> 01:05:42.013]  We always promote it some, but I've been harping, harping, harping because you really need the high-quality, store-able food.
[01:05:42.033 --> 01:05:42.454]  We've got it now.
[01:05:42.494 --> 01:05:43.975]  It's one to two weeks for delivery.
[01:05:44.015 --> 01:05:44.795]  Everybody got their food.
[01:05:44.815 --> 01:05:46.697]  They ordered it from the whole COVID hysteria.
[01:05:46.757 --> 01:05:47.678]  I said, don't do it for that.
[01:05:48.078 --> 01:05:51.541]  Do it for the lockdown of civilization or the depression they're trying to engineer.
[01:05:51.581 --> 01:05:54.964]  So a lot of people are ordering food right now, and I believe there's going to be a big rush on food.
[01:05:56.001 --> 01:05:56.741]  Coming up, probably.
[01:05:57.082 --> 01:06:04.125]  So get ahead of the pack, get ahead of the crowd, get ahead of the herd, and get your swearable food now while you still can.
[01:06:04.385 --> 01:06:07.027]  Get high quality that's affordable at infowarstore.com.
[01:06:08.207 --> 01:06:09.068]  And we are back!
[01:06:10.128 --> 01:06:13.291]  Well, I really appreciate Dr. Steve Pachinik for joining us two days in a row.
[01:06:13.451 --> 01:06:19.337]  I wanted to get him on about 9-11 and 19 years later, which is today, but we got into a bunch of other subjects.
[01:06:19.738 --> 01:06:24.943]  And so he's here with us for two long segments, one short segment ahead of the Hodge Brothers joining us.
[01:06:24.963 --> 01:06:26.905]  So let's plunge right into it.
[01:06:28.206 --> 01:06:28.846]  We're good to go.
[01:06:45.331 --> 01:06:48.313]  And a lot of the things he's talked about here on air, he's revealed first.
[01:06:48.353 --> 01:06:59.519]  He also co-wrote a lot of books as kind of the Jack Ryan source for what couldn't be put in a non-fiction book, but was put in the Tom Clancy franchise, which a lot of those got turned into major movies.
[01:06:59.539 --> 01:07:01.460]  But in the time we have, let's just get right to it.
[01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.281]  What was the motive of 9-11?
[01:07:03.782 --> 01:07:04.742]  Who was behind it?
[01:07:04.842 --> 01:07:05.923]  Why is it important?
[01:07:06.583 --> 01:07:15.513]  Because, again, we're not saying radical Islam doesn't exist, we're not saying that, but clearly, the Stand Down, Building 7, how do you want to attack this up front?
[01:07:15.853 --> 01:07:20.598]  And you talk about being in rooms with top generals, you know, that said point blank, yeah, it was an inside job.
[01:07:20.638 --> 01:07:22.040]  Dr. Steve Buczynik, thanks for your courage.
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:25.143]  There's no question this was an inside job.
[01:07:25.864 --> 01:07:26.845]  Before 9-11, the year before,
[01:07:28.704 --> 01:07:30.746]  After having helped Bush Jr.
[01:07:30.806 --> 01:07:40.773]  go into the presidency, which was my biggest mistake, I went around to the Department of Defense and I was asked to look for specific jobs.
[01:07:41.353 --> 01:07:43.815]  And as I went around, I saw something very unusual.
[01:07:44.015 --> 01:07:51.840]  I saw CIA operatives in every military position that I was interested in, from Salt Lake to other areas.
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:52.621]  It doesn't matter.
[01:07:53.201 --> 01:08:05.505]  I went to Andy Marshall, who was the head of the office in that assessment, trained at the University of Chicago, never served in the war, but I knew he was in charge of Cheney, Rumsfeld, Zalmay Khalilzad, a whole bunch of neocons.
[01:08:06.125 --> 01:08:17.949]  And what in fact happened a year later, four months before 9-11, I had a knock on the door from two Mossad operatives who really didn't know what they were doing.
[01:08:17.989 --> 01:08:21.250]  They were quite stupid, which I think Mossad is normally.
[01:08:21.690 --> 01:08:25.371]  They knocked on the door and Chevy chased and asked if they could use my phone.
[01:08:25.431 --> 01:08:26.891]  I said, under no condition.
[01:08:27.411 --> 01:08:28.192]  They pursued.
[01:08:28.212 --> 01:08:29.212]  I threw them out.
[01:08:29.692 --> 01:08:34.993]  So when 9-11 came around, the first person they had to ask about what happened was me.
[01:08:35.533 --> 01:08:38.274]  And I said, there's no question this is an inside job.
[01:08:38.394 --> 01:08:41.475]  Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice,
[01:08:41.935 --> 01:08:46.117]  Colin Powell, Steve Hadley, Frank Fupiama, Richard Perle.
[01:08:46.177 --> 01:08:46.818]  I knew them all.
[01:08:47.418 --> 01:08:50.439]  Most of them went to Cornell and the rest went to Yale.
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:57.803]  And I said, these are the corrupt cowards, what we call chicken hawks, who are involved in creating a 9-11.
[01:08:58.023 --> 01:08:59.144]  Now, how did I know that?
[01:08:59.364 --> 01:09:04.927]  Not only did I go around and see Doug Feith and others who never belonged at Department of Defense,
[01:09:05.547 --> 01:09:13.171]  I also questioned one of my neighbors, who in fact was a CIA operative at DOD and knew the entire story.
[01:09:13.851 --> 01:09:19.373]  And I got from her the entire story of who was involved, the names and people involved.
[01:09:19.493 --> 01:09:24.215]  I put it in the book, American Warrior in Crisis, if people want to look at the various names.
[01:09:24.736 --> 01:09:34.200]  The key point was that Cheney Rumsfeld, Cheney in particular, whom I knew from the Nixon administration as I did Rumsfeld, was a coward.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:39.141]  Probably the most treasonous coward we have ever had in the United States.
[01:09:39.201 --> 01:09:48.324]  He refused to serve us in Vietnam 11 different times with the assistance of his wife and now he has a daughter who to me it's absurd.
[01:09:48.464 --> 01:09:50.424]  So what did we learn from that event?
[01:09:51.024 --> 01:09:51.425]  Nothing.
[01:09:52.165 --> 01:09:58.166]  What I learned from it is number one the military can be manipulated and really can't win a war.
[01:09:58.667 --> 01:10:03.768]  Our intelligence service all the way from the CIA Gina Haspel to Tenet
[01:10:04.395 --> 01:10:10.179]  To all the others who were in charge, Robert Goss, they were all compromised and were involved.
[01:10:10.879 --> 01:10:12.781]  Number four, I knew Bush Jr.
[01:10:12.821 --> 01:10:19.426]  was involved in the same way his father, Bush Sr., was involved in creating a war in the Middle East, which we had no reason to do.
[01:10:20.067 --> 01:10:25.291]  Both men, not only Bush Jr., had failed in the military.
[01:10:25.771 --> 01:10:30.275]  Contrary to the myth that's propagated about Bush Sr., he was not a war hero.
[01:10:30.735 --> 01:10:34.679]  He bailed out of the plane and allowed eight of his airmen to die.
[01:10:35.059 --> 01:10:35.920]  He was a coward.
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:37.961]  Bush Jr., a coward.
[01:10:38.302 --> 01:10:38.682]  Corrupt.
[01:10:39.142 --> 01:10:40.404]  Cheney, a coward.
[01:10:40.844 --> 01:10:42.906]  I said to Rumsfeld, you're a coward.
[01:10:42.986 --> 01:10:44.488]  I know exactly what you did.
[01:10:45.029 --> 01:10:49.253]  He went on the radio the next day after I accused him and the administration.
[01:10:49.293 --> 01:10:59.985]  He said, if somebody accuses the Republicans of doing 9-11, which is called a false flag and a standout, then you have to accuse the Democrats for doing Pearl Harbor.
[01:11:00.445 --> 01:11:06.507]  Well, as many of you know, the false flags of Pearl Harbor means that we knew exactly what was going to happen at Pearl Harbor.
[01:11:06.847 --> 01:11:11.188]  We wanted to sacrifice 3,000 to 4,000 men in order to precipitate a war.
[01:11:11.888 --> 01:11:18.089]  Same way the LBJ had a false flag in Vietnam, John F. Kennedy had a false flag in New York.
[01:11:18.129 --> 01:11:20.390]  Let me stop you from talking, and that's absolutely true.
[01:11:20.410 --> 01:11:21.250]  And let's just go back.
[01:11:21.930 --> 01:11:28.092]  Rebuilding America's defenses, April 1st, 2020, Dick Cheney pins that
[01:11:29.412 --> 01:11:33.980]  I don't know how they hit it just right less than a year later.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:35.382]  I mean, they really did a good job.
[01:11:41.010 --> 01:11:42.932]  Well, it's not that they did a good job.
[01:11:43.152 --> 01:11:44.874]  They were craven individuals.
[01:11:44.954 --> 01:11:47.396]  Zalmay Khalasad worked for me on the West Bank.
[01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:48.377]  He's a disaster.
[01:11:48.698 --> 01:11:51.421]  He's been in, he created the war in Afghanistan.
[01:11:51.461 --> 01:11:52.842]  He's a CIA operative.
[01:11:52.862 --> 01:11:53.122]  Sure, sure.
[01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:55.725]  I was being sarcastic, but I mean, so you knew before it even came in.
[01:11:55.745 --> 01:11:57.366]  You were a big member of the CFR, all of this.
[01:11:57.386 --> 01:11:59.469]  I remember you resigned after all of this.
[01:12:00.532 --> 01:12:10.258]  I left because I knew exactly who in the CFR was involved in 9-11, and I told them, I'm going to be the first American to leave your organization in, what, 120 years?
[01:12:10.318 --> 01:12:11.218]  I couldn't care less.
[01:12:11.779 --> 01:12:25.827]  The CFR was compromised, you had the United States government compromised, our military intelligence, our civilian intelligence, our Department of Justice was compromised, the White House was compromised, and the House of Representatives.
[01:12:25.987 --> 01:12:26.828]  Anything else left?
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:47.152]  Then what they did was to turn around the narrative and say, God, we are conspiracy truthers, as if we have the burden in order to explain why this coward and moron who was elected twice was involved in a 9-11 stand down and false flag.
[01:12:47.272 --> 01:12:51.374]  And we had the biggest coward in our history, a treasonous man.
[01:12:51.434 --> 01:12:52.715]  He should have been taken out.
[01:12:53.115 --> 01:12:54.336]  He should have gone to jail.
[01:12:54.416 --> 01:12:55.477]  Of course, nobody did it.
[01:12:55.977 --> 01:12:57.217]  Cheney didn't go to jail.
[01:12:57.517 --> 01:12:58.698]  Rumsfeld didn't go to jail.
[01:12:58.978 --> 01:13:02.338]  By the way, Black Lives Matter, I'm gonna be very nice.
[01:13:02.639 --> 01:13:07.480]  We had Colin Powell, Secretary of State, a pathological liar.
[01:13:07.860 --> 01:13:10.120]  In Vietnam, he lied about the incidents.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:13.641]  And then when he was in the Bush administration, he lied about anthrax.
[01:13:13.981 --> 01:13:16.482]  He was as dumb as they come out of CCNY.
[01:13:16.502 --> 01:13:18.642]  Let's talk about what was the motive of 9-11.
[01:13:18.662 --> 01:13:19.342]  What's the motive?
[01:13:20.342 --> 01:13:23.003]  Let me give you another equal opportunity.
[01:13:23.832 --> 01:13:27.214]  Condoleezza Rice, whom I knew very well from Stanford.
[01:13:27.254 --> 01:13:32.718]  She told Willie Brown, do not fly to New York that week, and so was the Joint Chiefs was told.
[01:13:32.738 --> 01:13:33.459]  That's all on record.
[01:13:34.519 --> 01:13:34.900]  Correct.
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:39.843]  But she was a liar, national security advisor, a coward.
[01:13:40.243 --> 01:13:41.284]  And what do they do?
[01:13:41.544 --> 01:13:43.045]  They retread everybody.
[01:13:43.145 --> 01:13:47.188]  The Hoover Institute right now, you got John Woo, you got Condoleezza Rice.
[01:13:47.468 --> 01:13:50.230]  And I said to the Hoover Institute, stick it up.
[01:13:51.227 --> 01:13:52.367]  You're out of control.
[01:13:52.667 --> 01:13:55.668]  The Rand Corporation, all of these guys out of control.
[01:13:55.788 --> 01:14:00.530]  And unfortunately for me, I knew, I was not surprised because I'm not a cynic.
[01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:01.590]  I'm a realist.
[01:14:01.690 --> 01:14:02.710]  I grew up in Europe.
[01:14:03.130 --> 01:14:05.431]  I saw the French collaborate with the Germans.
[01:14:05.491 --> 01:14:12.573]  I saw the French beat up Algerians, Moroccans, and then assassinate one million Tutsis in Rwanda.
[01:14:13.271 --> 01:14:19.293]  What I know is that we have lied, and we have prevaricated, and we killed our own people.
[01:14:19.473 --> 01:14:21.994]  Not the first time, not the last time.
[01:14:22.134 --> 01:14:27.036]  But if anybody comes out to be sanctimonious about it, they better be careful.
[01:14:27.476 --> 01:14:35.679]  Because I was the first one interviewed in this entire episode, and I said under no condition was this Islamic terrorist.
[01:14:35.839 --> 01:14:40.661]  Well, let's talk about that, but you also said right after it happened, you met with the top general who confirmed to you it was staged.
[01:14:41.701 --> 01:14:42.141]  Correct!
[01:14:43.002 --> 01:14:46.325]  And I said to the generals, and I sat down with them, I'm not going to name them.
[01:14:46.746 --> 01:14:48.187]  I said, you have two choices.
[01:14:48.788 --> 01:14:57.876]  Either you resign and I'm going to court-martial you, or you start to rethink what you're doing and get the civilians out of the Pentagon.
[01:14:58.237 --> 01:15:00.499]  That meant Doug Fyfe, Paul Wolfowitz.
[01:15:00.899 --> 01:15:03.682]  Eventually, Paul Wolfowitz, a pathetic,
[01:15:04.382 --> 01:15:10.765]  Powerly individual who came out of Cornell University, by the way, one of the big universities to push 9-11.
[01:15:11.345 --> 01:15:19.609]  It had Paul Wolfowitz, it had Steve Hadley, Frank Fukuyama, and Sandy Berger from the Clinton administration.
[01:15:19.689 --> 01:15:21.130]  Cornell never said a word.
[01:15:22.291 --> 01:15:22.651]  Stay there.
[01:15:22.711 --> 01:15:24.412]  I know people that are in the know understand what you're saying.
[01:15:24.432 --> 01:15:25.332]  Most listeners do as well.
[01:15:25.372 --> 01:15:28.614]  But let's, I don't want to say dumb it down, but let's just walk through this one and come back.
[01:15:29.494 --> 01:15:34.441]  You have this civilian taking over the military, but they don't know about the consequences, and they do these crazy false flags.
[01:15:34.741 --> 01:15:37.805]  We did see a revolution in the military after all this to try to kick them out.
[01:15:38.125 --> 01:15:38.986]  How has that gone?
[01:15:39.006 --> 01:15:42.491]  And is Trump the culmination of that revolution to get the U.S.
[01:15:42.591 --> 01:15:44.073]  military back in control of themselves?
[01:15:45.915 --> 01:15:47.538]  We're not gonna take it lying down.
[01:15:49.266 --> 01:15:52.287]  Look, I went on air that day and knew those were controlled demolitions.
[01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:55.109]  I heard them say they blew up Building 7, the CIA headquarters.
[01:15:55.969 --> 01:16:00.611]  I got physically sick on air saying elements of our government did that because I love America.
[01:16:00.632 --> 01:16:01.972]  I knew it was globalist impostors.
[01:16:02.632 --> 01:16:06.875]  And people ask me, once Obama got in and things moved on, why didn't cover 9-11 as much?
[01:16:07.995 --> 01:16:16.060]  Well, because it was about getting that group of neocons and who did that, and I was still exposing false flags, but just I wasn't making my fifth or sixth film on it.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:25.266]  I wasn't harping on it every day, because people would think then that the government did it when it was criminal elements that did it, and so it actually became destructive of the country.
[01:16:25.286 --> 01:16:25.847]  So I want to be clear.
[01:16:26.347 --> 01:16:28.088]  People ask, why didn't you keep harping on 9-11?
[01:16:28.128 --> 01:16:29.149]  I still talk about it quite a bit.
[01:16:29.169 --> 01:16:29.889]  We have guests on.
[01:16:30.269 --> 01:16:35.233]  It's important to revisit sometimes, but how do you expose the criminal elements that did this?
[01:16:36.109 --> 01:16:45.457]  While at the same time, not destroying patriotism and having it blow back, like the left uses 9-11 to hurt America, when I don't really see it as America that was doing it.
[01:16:45.477 --> 01:16:49.781]  You're not just a psychiatrist, you're a, you know, an old school hand of the world, Dr. Pachinik.
[01:16:50.181 --> 01:16:52.383]  I mean, how do we address something?
[01:16:52.443 --> 01:17:02.772]  Justice be done, may the heavens fall, but, you know, at a certain point, I still talk about 9-11, but justice never happened, so then it almost just becomes destructive to constantly cover it.
[01:17:04.318 --> 01:17:05.419]  Not really, my friend.
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:09.403]  We will not see justice vis-a-vis this issue.
[01:17:09.563 --> 01:17:10.104]  We will not.
[01:17:10.284 --> 01:17:11.965]  I mean, that's just a point of fact.
[01:17:12.046 --> 01:17:15.369]  That's exactly what I've learned the day after that.
[01:17:15.529 --> 01:17:16.550]  No one would be held
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:17.680]  Accountable.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:19.861]  You and I can repeat the story.
[01:17:20.381 --> 01:17:25.363]  We will be put in Wikipedia as truthers, as conspiracy theorists.
[01:17:25.783 --> 01:17:29.825]  That's the price that you and I pay for telling the truth.
[01:17:30.385 --> 01:17:35.947]  It's the same price when I said, look, Abraham Lincoln was not a great liberator of slaves.
[01:17:36.287 --> 01:17:37.388]  He was a tyrant.
[01:17:37.648 --> 01:17:42.450]  When he was assassinated, the words were, thus always with tyrants.
[01:17:43.070 --> 01:17:47.371]  And so we create our own narratives which are totally false.
[01:17:48.011 --> 01:17:49.571]  You and I will continue that.
[01:17:49.731 --> 01:17:51.612]  People will cover that over.
[01:17:51.652 --> 01:17:54.072]  When you see Wikipedia, it's pathetic.
[01:17:54.553 --> 01:17:58.573]  When I was reading exactly what happened in 9-11, it was pathetic.
[01:17:58.633 --> 01:18:03.975]  So they had a separate section which said, truthers, what the truthers say.
[01:18:04.075 --> 01:18:06.895]  And that's how pathetic intellectualism.
[01:18:07.095 --> 01:18:10.556]  You're talking about the end of American intellectualism.
[01:18:10.956 --> 01:18:15.057]  You're talking about the end of a capacity that we had at one time.
[01:18:15.337 --> 01:18:19.678]  No, but I agree, but at the time we have, we come back for five hours to do this again because it's so important historically.
[01:18:20.258 --> 01:18:21.999]  I want to cover it, I just want to cover it right.
[01:18:22.279 --> 01:18:26.500]  I know you have a lot of gravitas in this area and what you're saying is a key witness to all this, Dr. Pichetting.
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:33.082]  So if the neocons and others are behind it, they wanted it for domestic police state to take over the Middle East.
[01:18:33.962 --> 01:18:36.062]  In context of 2020, why is it important?
[01:18:39.218 --> 01:18:50.822]  Because you have to understand now that we have a system that really doesn't always work for the people and by the people, except for one little notation, which is important.
[01:18:51.471 --> 01:18:59.617]  We have a new person who has not been part of the CIA, not been part of the military, not been part of anything other than business.
[01:19:00.117 --> 01:19:02.979]  And his job today is to do business.
[01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:05.961]  And that's the only salvation we have.
[01:19:06.422 --> 01:19:12.506]  So it's the maverick, sui generis, of his own kind thing is why they hate Trump.
[01:19:12.766 --> 01:19:15.388]  And the sui generis movement is the answer.
[01:19:16.257 --> 01:19:16.677]  Correct.
[01:19:16.798 --> 01:19:34.696]  I mean, we, for whatever reasons, we allowed and created a man to come in at this point whom, ironically, everybody involved in 9-11, including the Democrats, and Biden was involved, and the Clintons were involved, and the Bushes, says, oh, he's a pathological liar.
[01:19:34.996 --> 01:19:35.517]  Really?
[01:19:35.717 --> 01:19:39.481]  Have you seen the videos of the day after where he said they clearly blew the towers up with bombs?
[01:19:40.373 --> 01:19:40.814]  Correct.
[01:19:40.914 --> 01:19:50.347]  And not only did I see them, but I also heard him say on the same day, because I had followed Trump for over 30, 40 years, he said, my, those buildings are pretty strong.
[01:19:50.407 --> 01:19:52.330]  I wonder how they can bring them down.
[01:19:52.811 --> 01:19:56.276]  So he was basically saying exactly what everybody else knew.
[01:19:56.716 --> 01:20:00.858]  Now, he will play the part of a president that continues that narrative.
[01:20:01.278 --> 01:20:05.259]  But beyond that, he will not trust anybody, and correctly so.
[01:20:05.639 --> 01:20:07.560]  He has his own family to work with.
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:11.602]  He has pointed his own... Well, that's why they call him dumb, because he doesn't tell any of those people what he really thinks.
[01:20:13.502 --> 01:20:13.802]  Really?
[01:20:13.882 --> 01:20:15.683]  I mean, it's what you and I talked about.
[01:20:15.823 --> 01:20:19.484]  You're that dumb that you created all these condominiums?
[01:20:19.604 --> 01:20:19.925]  Three?
[01:20:20.005 --> 01:20:23.446]  You're that dumb you just beat the whole deep state and then held them off for four years?
[01:20:24.733 --> 01:20:29.617]  Of course, and became a multi-billionaire several times over, although he had bankruptcy.
[01:20:29.737 --> 01:20:30.898]  I'd like to be that dumb.
[01:20:31.338 --> 01:20:36.802]  I want to be as dumb as somebody like that who can basically say whatever you want to hear, Woodward.
[01:20:36.942 --> 01:20:38.944]  And by the way, Woodward is now getting it.
[01:20:39.004 --> 01:20:41.165]  Congratulations to you, Alex.
[01:20:41.185 --> 01:20:46.930]  They want to know why Woodward held it for six months, that particular secret that was far more lethal.
[01:20:47.010 --> 01:20:49.932]  Because Woodward, once again, is a coward.
[01:20:50.252 --> 01:20:52.354]  He's a CIA operative out of Yale.
[01:20:53.415 --> 01:20:54.416]  It doesn't change.
[01:20:54.536 --> 01:20:56.678]  These people have been highly compromised.
[01:20:57.499 --> 01:21:02.264]  A friend of mine said to me, why are you attacking the CIA when I was trained by it?
[01:21:02.665 --> 01:21:04.967]  And I said to this friend who was head of the U.S.
[01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:13.657]  Institute of Peace and came out of MIT, I said to him, you will see why I never belonged to anything except the Republic.
[01:21:14.444 --> 01:21:16.468]  I was allowed to join the military.
[01:21:16.608 --> 01:21:17.991]  I served five presidents.
[01:21:18.071 --> 01:21:24.683]  Because you've got to owe allegiance to the idea and the people and the dirt, not to some corrupt Ivy League elitist institution.
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:36.950]  That's exactly what happened, and I said I pledge allegiance to the Republic, that's why I came back with the generals, Keith Alexander and others, and said this is your time to be in charge.
[01:21:37.090 --> 01:21:40.774]  No more Rumsfeld, no more Cheney's, no more Bush's.
[01:21:41.154 --> 01:21:42.495]  I don't want chicken hawks here.
[01:21:42.835 --> 01:21:45.878]  I want guys who... Why do you think Alexander's going over to Amazon?
[01:21:45.898 --> 01:21:48.520]  I'm sorry?
[01:21:48.540 --> 01:21:49.441]  Keith Alexander?
[01:21:49.461 --> 01:21:49.541]  Yeah.
[01:21:50.894 --> 01:21:53.218]  I'll tell you, he is very, very bright.
[01:21:53.719 --> 01:21:56.725]  You said for a long time he'd be the good head of Cyber Command.
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:57.940]  Correct.
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:21:59.602]  And he was head of Cyber Command.
[01:21:59.662 --> 01:22:05.606]  And then his junior subordinates, Nakasone, who's head of Cyber Command, also excellent.
[01:22:05.907 --> 01:22:08.549]  These guys, Keith went to the Academy.
[01:22:08.849 --> 01:22:10.070]  Nakasone did not.
[01:22:10.190 --> 01:22:16.875]  And then I'm proposing a General Brown for the Air Force to be head of Space Command and Space Warfare.
[01:22:17.275 --> 01:22:20.518]  So we have people on board who are going to be able to do things.
[01:22:20.598 --> 01:22:22.820]  I'm proud that Keith will take over Amazon.
[01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:23.901]  They need him.
[01:22:23.941 --> 01:22:25.502]  He understands cyber control.
[01:22:26.042 --> 01:22:28.304]  The world has changed in 20 years.
[01:22:28.465 --> 01:22:32.528]  Number one, you have become a predominant source of information.
[01:22:32.588 --> 01:22:33.930]  The New York Times is done.
[01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:35.511]  The Washington Post is done.
[01:22:35.551 --> 01:22:37.053]  The Wall Street Journal is done.
[01:22:37.073 --> 01:22:40.436]  I was going to say, I don't know if I've become the prominent thing, but definitely part of it.
[01:22:40.776 --> 01:22:41.757]  But yeah, what are they going to do?
[01:22:41.777 --> 01:22:43.399]  Because no one believes a damn word they say.
[01:22:43.659 --> 01:22:49.965]  And they just keep, like CNN especially, is like a zombie undead creature that won't go away, but no one listens to it.
[01:22:51.298 --> 01:22:53.560]  I mean, what do you want about Anderson Cooper?
[01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:59.964]  He's an openly gay guy who forgets to tell you he had two internships at the CIA.
[01:23:00.404 --> 01:23:02.666]  And once again, he too is compromised.
[01:23:02.726 --> 01:23:08.230]  It's almost as if every one of them checked their brains right at the agency or somewhere else.
[01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:13.734]  But the truth of the matter is, I could care less about the CIA or the other 16 intelligence units.
[01:23:14.154 --> 01:23:14.895]  They're useless.
[01:23:16.095 --> 01:23:17.716]  The issue is these people are followers.
[01:23:18.176 --> 01:23:19.477]  Who is in control of them?
[01:23:19.517 --> 01:23:21.798]  Because whoever's in control is pretty stupid.
[01:23:23.258 --> 01:23:27.700]  They were stupid, but there's a new guy who's in control and his name is Grinnell.
[01:23:28.020 --> 01:23:33.482]  And I listened to how he was handling the issues as a former ambassador to Germany.
[01:23:33.703 --> 01:23:35.563]  Insightful, smart.
[01:23:35.603 --> 01:23:39.305]  Oh yeah, he confronted the media and said, don't you understand last week you're obsolete?
[01:23:40.222 --> 01:23:40.703]  Correct.
[01:23:41.003 --> 01:23:42.444]  And he said, you're not relevant.
[01:23:42.564 --> 01:23:43.505]  You're immature.
[01:23:43.565 --> 01:23:44.426]  You're childish.
[01:23:44.466 --> 01:23:46.628]  Let me tell you about Serbia and Kosovo.
[01:23:46.909 --> 01:23:49.291]  And somebody wanted to ask him about being gay.
[01:23:49.331 --> 01:23:50.792]  He said, it's not relevant.
[01:23:51.133 --> 01:23:52.794]  Let's talk about policy.
[01:23:52.914 --> 01:24:02.384]  So I think Trump put in a great guy in the intelligence network, and I hope he takes down a lot of it, reorganizes it, use Wilbur Ross.
[01:24:02.864 --> 01:24:04.064]  Well, that's my next question.
[01:24:04.164 --> 01:24:07.926]  If Trump gets four more years, which we hope he does, I think it needs a really clean house.
[01:24:07.966 --> 01:24:09.886]  Let's talk about when we come back how you would do that.
[01:24:10.006 --> 01:24:14.368]  You were called in some administrations to clean house because we've got to remove all this dead wood.
[01:24:14.388 --> 01:24:15.248]  These people are crazy.
[01:24:15.948 --> 01:24:20.889]  And now it's come out that Robert Mueller was wiping all the phones illegally, didn't even care.
[01:24:21.210 --> 01:24:24.671]  Like he was above the law and they were, I mean, this is just, these people are crazy.
[01:24:26.751 --> 01:24:28.232]  They're not crazy what they are.
[01:24:29.562 --> 01:24:38.170]  You know, Mueller served us well in Vietnam, and then he had to, what we call, suck up to power.
[01:24:38.731 --> 01:24:43.636]  And Mueller should be ashamed of himself, because as an Episcopalian, he really
[01:24:45.597 --> 01:24:49.699]  He denigrated both our country and both his own religion.
[01:24:50.019 --> 01:24:52.780]  And to this day, he has never said mea culpa.
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:57.622]  This is an intellectual who should have gone out of his way to say, I'm not going to do it.
[01:24:57.642 --> 01:25:01.504]  Well, did he not look completely broken in testimony last year?
[01:25:01.524 --> 01:25:03.224]  I mean, he looked like a ghost.
[01:25:04.145 --> 01:25:04.465]  Correct.
[01:25:04.505 --> 01:25:06.045]  He was totally unintelligible.
[01:25:06.105 --> 01:25:09.767]  But none of them have come forward and say mea culpa.
[01:25:10.027 --> 01:25:11.107]  I've made a mistake.
[01:25:11.367 --> 01:25:12.488]  I wanted reform.
[01:25:13.237 --> 01:25:17.698]  So the notion of Judeo-Christian overtones in this society is nonsense.
[01:25:18.278 --> 01:25:19.318]  It's just a myth.
[01:25:20.079 --> 01:25:21.519]  And what comes forth?
[01:25:21.799 --> 01:25:24.700]  You've got the Alex Jones, alternative media.
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:29.561]  Dr. Persim, we've got to go to Breit, StevePersenity.com, but what I'm asking is, I agree with you, there are a bunch of order followers.
[01:25:30.061 --> 01:25:31.001]  So who's in command?
[01:25:31.101 --> 01:25:31.581]  Obama?
[01:25:31.901 --> 01:25:32.321]  Hillary?
[01:25:32.701 --> 01:25:33.122]  Soros?
[01:25:33.202 --> 01:25:38.843]  Because I study these people and I watch them, and they have to like, they get a script, they follow it, even after they've lost.
[01:25:39.383 --> 01:25:41.164]  They're still following three-year-old scripts.
[01:25:41.204 --> 01:25:42.665]  Like, there's no one in command.
[01:25:42.945 --> 01:25:46.388]  They're following the last election and fighting the last war.
[01:25:46.408 --> 01:25:47.568]  And that's actually horrifying.
[01:25:47.588 --> 01:25:48.989]  We'll be right back in two minutes.
[01:25:49.049 --> 01:25:50.150]  Final segment under Steve McChinnick.
[01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:53.072]  Then the Hodge twins, who are megaviral, join us.
[01:25:53.132 --> 01:25:53.752]  Stay with us.
[01:25:54.053 --> 01:25:55.113]  We're 52 days out.
[01:25:56.574 --> 01:25:57.775]  We are back live.
[01:25:57.855 --> 01:25:58.996]  Ted Nugent bringing us in.
[01:25:59.016 --> 01:26:00.937]  All right, Steve McChinnick, stevemchinnick.com.
[01:26:01.378 --> 01:26:02.058]  Thanks for joining us.
[01:26:02.078 --> 01:26:04.480]  We really appreciate you giving us all this time.
[01:26:05.020 --> 01:26:06.381]  In the four or five minutes we have left,
[01:26:08.083 --> 01:26:13.249]  I mean, the question I was getting into is a little esoteric, but who is in command of the left?
[01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:15.552]  Why do they go out of their way to destroy themselves?
[01:26:15.632 --> 01:26:17.234]  I don't get self-destruction at that level.
[01:26:17.995 --> 01:26:20.919]  And what do you expect them to do in this election?
[01:26:20.979 --> 01:26:22.541]  What should we be watching for in closing?
[01:26:24.022 --> 01:26:26.624]  Basically, you've got nobody in command of this left.
[01:26:26.784 --> 01:26:34.391]  What's happening, it's basically a conglomerate of ineffectual people who had an ideology that once was vibrant for them.
[01:26:35.031 --> 01:26:38.694]  But you have a Soros who's funding some things, the Hillary Clintons.
[01:26:39.095 --> 01:26:39.955]  They're just names.
[01:26:40.476 --> 01:26:43.839]  At this particular point in time, you're not going to have a Democratic Party.
[01:26:44.559 --> 01:26:47.502]  As far as I'm concerned, the Republican Party is gone.
[01:26:47.662 --> 01:26:50.244]  The party that really is in power is called Trump.
[01:26:51.225 --> 01:26:55.450]  And he will appoint those people he needs in order to affect change.
[01:26:55.891 --> 01:27:01.257]  The notion of ideological parties at the time of the social media is antiquated.
[01:27:01.778 --> 01:27:08.806]  What's relevant now are little pieces of information that comes across at different times on the internet, social media.
[01:27:09.147 --> 01:27:10.989]  Most people are getting addicted to it.
[01:27:11.329 --> 01:27:14.311]  But in reality, the parties are really antiquated.
[01:27:14.351 --> 01:27:16.333]  You don't need a House of Representatives.
[01:27:16.373 --> 01:27:17.574]  You don't need a Senate.
[01:27:17.934 --> 01:27:19.616]  Those are just welfare victims.
[01:27:20.016 --> 01:27:21.617]  What you do need are the governors.
[01:27:21.957 --> 01:27:23.599]  And Abbott is important.
[01:27:23.679 --> 01:27:31.084]  DeSantis in Florida is exceedingly important because he can do whatever he wants and he can defy the principles of the federal government.
[01:27:31.525 --> 01:27:35.688]  The federal government is already breaking up in terms of a cyber nation.
[01:27:36.128 --> 01:27:40.809]  The two ends of the East and the West and the South are really non-functional anymore.
[01:27:41.130 --> 01:27:42.310]  The cities are empty.
[01:27:42.690 --> 01:27:47.251]  So what you have is a new era where a businessman is coming in.
[01:27:47.711 --> 01:27:51.532]  He will create peace in different areas of the world.
[01:27:51.612 --> 01:27:53.193]  Bahrain will be the next one.
[01:27:53.673 --> 01:27:53.773]  Yes.
[01:28:15.376 --> 01:28:15.716]  Why?
[01:28:15.736 --> 01:28:23.020]  It has to do with the fact that most of them are pretty ineffectual in terms of creating a business or running anything.
[01:28:23.101 --> 01:28:25.462]  Como has never run a business.
[01:28:25.902 --> 01:28:31.505]  Como's mother is a lovely person whom I know, but both sons are totally dysfunctional.
[01:28:31.946 --> 01:28:35.568]  They can talk, they create process, but nothing else.
[01:28:35.628 --> 01:28:41.231]  So when you're in the business of process, unlike you and I, where we have a product, you have a product,
[01:28:41.651 --> 01:28:45.055]  You have vitamins, you have a content, I have content.
[01:28:45.636 --> 01:28:49.681]  That's different from the people who are in the process business, which is politics.
[01:28:50.462 --> 01:29:00.073]  Politics will no longer supersede the ongoing relationships that we have in terms of moments of truth, what they will call the alternative truth.
[01:29:00.715 --> 01:29:01.315]  I think so.
[01:29:20.242 --> 01:29:30.426]  Now they're running to the middle to get away from themselves, and these systems are literally making themselves obsolete, and they're trying to bully all us into submission, but only destroying themselves faster.
[01:29:30.466 --> 01:29:31.587]  It's an incredible process.
[01:29:32.447 --> 01:29:39.050]  Well, it was predictable, and that process really had the final punch, which was coronavirus.
[01:29:39.310 --> 01:29:41.671]  Was that incidental or coincidental?
[01:29:42.091 --> 01:29:49.174]  I don't have to get into it, but it was not... But they inflict the biggest lockdowns on themselves to control us, only destroying themselves!
[01:29:50.094 --> 01:29:50.555]  Correct.
[01:29:50.675 --> 01:29:51.936]  And that's what happened.
[01:29:52.056 --> 01:29:58.623]  We eventually went into self-destruction, which is the final moment of 9-11, where we self-destruct.
[01:29:58.663 --> 01:30:00.505]  Cutting the nose off to spite the face.
[01:30:00.645 --> 01:30:01.105]  Amazing.
[01:30:01.165 --> 01:30:02.547]  Dr. Stephen Chinnick, thank you so much.
[01:30:03.476 --> 01:30:05.058]  Thank you, Alex, and God bless.
[01:30:05.158 --> 01:30:05.698]  God bless you.
[01:30:05.718 --> 01:30:09.322]  We have a big, powerful 9-11 interview, and that's the real deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:30:09.663 --> 01:30:10.003]  All right.
[01:30:10.243 --> 01:30:11.565]  The Hodge brothers are on fire.
[01:30:11.585 --> 01:30:14.728]  They've always been on fire for years, but they're really in fuego now.
[01:30:15.149 --> 01:30:17.331]  We'll be talking to them in 60 seconds.
[01:30:17.852 --> 01:30:18.492]  I'm excited.
[01:30:18.713 --> 01:30:19.934]  Tell folks how to tune in right now.
[01:30:19.954 --> 01:30:21.716]  However you're watching and listening, please tune in.
[01:30:22.136 --> 01:30:23.177]  That's how we reach new people.
[01:30:23.217 --> 01:30:24.559]  That's how we override the censors.
[01:30:24.899 --> 01:30:25.320]  Stay with us.
[01:30:27.568 --> 01:30:30.970]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[01:30:30.990 --> 01:30:32.110]  They're going to contest the election.
[01:30:32.130 --> 01:30:33.691]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[01:30:33.851 --> 01:30:35.232]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[01:30:35.372 --> 01:30:36.373]  I want them shut down.
[01:30:36.453 --> 01:30:37.353]  I want them silenced.
[01:30:37.413 --> 01:30:38.214]  I want them muted.
[01:30:38.254 --> 01:30:40.015]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:30:40.055 --> 01:30:40.995]  You kept us on air.
[01:30:41.115 --> 01:30:42.416]  We did the analysis first.
[01:30:42.696 --> 01:30:43.696]  It's now gone mainstream.
[01:30:43.757 --> 01:30:45.557]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[01:30:45.838 --> 01:30:51.721]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[01:30:52.301 --> 01:30:53.382]  You need to stop right now.
[01:30:53.463 --> 01:30:54.544]  And they're very, very serious.
[01:30:54.684 --> 01:30:57.047]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[01:30:57.167 --> 01:30:57.989]  It's not gonna happen.
[01:30:58.009 --> 01:30:59.931]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[01:31:00.372 --> 01:31:01.493]  I used to say, support InfoWars.
[01:31:01.954 --> 01:31:02.835]  Rescue InfoWars.
[01:31:02.915 --> 01:31:03.576]  Save yourself.
[01:31:03.916 --> 01:31:04.577]  Save the world.
[01:31:04.878 --> 01:31:05.739]  We're in this together.
[01:31:06.079 --> 01:31:06.840]  Because let me tell you something.
[01:31:07.481 --> 01:31:08.462]  Communism's up here.
[01:31:08.662 --> 01:31:11.623]  Infowars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[01:31:12.024 --> 01:31:13.825]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[01:31:14.045 --> 01:31:15.586]  My children are right here!
[01:31:16.326 --> 01:31:18.047]  But I need money to fight a war!
[01:31:18.267 --> 01:31:19.308]  And I need word of mouth!
[01:31:19.528 --> 01:31:20.428]  And I need prayer!
[01:31:20.568 --> 01:31:21.529]  And I need action!
[01:31:21.909 --> 01:31:23.490]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[01:31:24.231 --> 01:31:26.172]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[01:31:26.952 --> 01:31:35.474]  Well, I've been loving these guys for years, but man, are they popular now, and are they exploding millions of views every day, despite the shadowbanning.
[01:31:35.494 --> 01:31:47.838]  The Hodge Twins on YouTube, Conservative Twins Instagram, Official Hodge Twins on Twitter, Hodge Twins, and they're here with us live on this Friday edition to cover the waterfront, but I just learned this.
[01:31:48.934 --> 01:31:51.137]  A few minutes ago, so I want to get their take on this.
[01:31:51.938 --> 01:31:55.101]  Trump nominated a second time for Nobel Prize, The Hill.
[01:31:55.121 --> 01:32:01.509]  I remember the Swedish Parliament on Friday nominated Trump and the governments of Kosovo and Serbia.
[01:32:02.739 --> 01:32:07.022]  For the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize over economic cooperation and trade talks.
[01:32:07.542 --> 01:32:09.524]  Now they have the UAE deal with Israel.
[01:32:09.564 --> 01:32:10.724]  That's worthy of it.
[01:32:10.744 --> 01:32:13.606]  You got Trump pulling us out of Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq.
[01:32:13.646 --> 01:32:14.447]  That's worthy of it.
[01:32:15.027 --> 01:32:21.932]  I mean, so I want to just invite these gentlemen to give me their view on does Trump deserve this nomination?
[01:32:21.972 --> 01:32:24.794]  And does Trump deserve the second nomination?
[01:32:25.514 --> 01:32:28.777]  And did Obama deserve his winning of the Peace Prize?
[01:32:29.457 --> 01:32:31.157]  Many, many years ago before he even got in office.
[01:32:31.177 --> 01:32:34.578]  So gentlemen, thank you for spending time with us and congratulations on your great success.
[01:32:35.719 --> 01:32:36.059]  Thank you.
[01:32:36.079 --> 01:32:36.819]  Thank you for having us.
[01:32:36.859 --> 01:32:38.580]  But yeah, of course he deserves it.
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:44.761]  I mean, Trump's done an amazing job since he came into office and they set the bar so low.
[01:32:45.301 --> 01:32:47.582]  Not only did they nominate Obama,
[01:32:48.314 --> 01:32:49.415]  He won the prize?
[01:32:49.856 --> 01:32:50.456]  Yeah.
[01:32:50.497 --> 01:32:52.138]  By doing absolutely nothing.
[01:32:52.379 --> 01:32:53.900]  The deal he broke between the U.A.?
[01:32:53.920 --> 01:32:56.143]  I mean, nobody saw that coming.
[01:32:56.323 --> 01:32:58.866]  He's did an amazing job since he became president.
[01:32:58.886 --> 01:33:01.048]  He's stopping the endless wars around the world?
[01:33:01.229 --> 01:33:01.449]  Yeah.
[01:33:01.689 --> 01:33:03.771]  Of course, he most definitely deserves that.
[01:33:05.046 --> 01:33:07.469]  Well, Democrats and Republicans always say they want to be peacemakers.
[01:33:07.489 --> 01:33:08.670]  With Trump, it's ridiculous.
[01:33:09.210 --> 01:33:19.982]  North Korea, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Serbia, and the Balkans, and then now all these other deals.
[01:33:20.002 --> 01:33:20.943]  This is getting crazy.
[01:33:22.779 --> 01:33:28.282]  Yeah, I thought it was amazing when he broke up that relationship with Kim Jong Un.
[01:33:28.403 --> 01:33:29.783]  I think I'm pronouncing his name right?
[01:33:29.863 --> 01:33:30.904]  Yeah, Rocket Man.
[01:33:31.124 --> 01:33:34.046]  Yeah, I started talking to him on Twitter and called him Rocket Man.
[01:33:34.206 --> 01:33:34.446]  Yeah.
[01:33:34.807 --> 01:33:36.528]  And then he goes over to the first U.S.
[01:33:36.568 --> 01:33:37.828]  president to ever do that.
[01:33:38.209 --> 01:33:38.489]  Right.
[01:33:38.789 --> 01:33:40.070]  I mean, this president
[01:33:40.630 --> 01:33:44.872]  Not only is he a great leader, this man has balls and he's not a politician.
[01:33:44.932 --> 01:33:49.854]  He's showing what a leader of the United States of the free world, what a leader should do.
[01:33:49.874 --> 01:33:50.475]  I totally agree.
[01:33:50.515 --> 01:33:52.656]  Look at the things he's done with the coronavirus, man.
[01:33:52.696 --> 01:33:54.036]  He locked this country down.
[01:33:54.096 --> 01:33:57.838]  He's did things that was unprecedented and nobody's giving him any credit for it.
[01:33:57.898 --> 01:34:02.440]  If he didn't do that, if Hillary was in office as our president, she wouldn't have did any of that.
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:03.801]  Well, that was my next question.
[01:34:04.161 --> 01:34:04.842]  That was my next question.
[01:34:04.862 --> 01:34:06.583]  In fact, cue up the clip where they call him a liar.
[01:34:06.863 --> 01:34:08.024]  He's in there with the press conference.
[01:34:08.325 --> 01:34:09.746]  He's the one that locked the U.S.
[01:34:09.786 --> 01:34:13.770]  down and blocked the flights from China when Pelosi was going around saying, don't do it.
[01:34:14.210 --> 01:34:15.231]  And so was Biden.
[01:34:16.272 --> 01:34:18.254]  And then they were telling Trump 4% are dying.
[01:34:18.274 --> 01:34:19.455]  He goes, well, hell, I better lock it down.
[01:34:19.715 --> 01:34:21.276]  Turned out it wasn't as deadly as they said.
[01:34:21.577 --> 01:34:26.441]  So because he's saying it's deadly six months ago when they were telling him that, and now he says it's not as bad, thank God.
[01:34:26.681 --> 01:34:27.442]  That's not lying.
[01:34:27.462 --> 01:34:28.463]  That's getting new information.
[01:34:29.264 --> 01:34:32.967]  Yeah and don't forget they call him xenophobic when he locked down the country.
[01:34:33.328 --> 01:34:37.431]  Yeah and uh what was it uh Pelosi said come on down to Chinatown.
[01:34:37.451 --> 01:34:40.133]  She's down there hugging Chinaman and all that stuff.
[01:34:40.253 --> 01:34:45.017]  Encouraging people to not social distance and to hug people just because they're Asian.
[01:34:45.058 --> 01:34:47.119]  Yeah because they claim Trump's xenophobic.
[01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:50.182]  I mean looking back on that it's just it's just pure hypocrisy.
[01:34:50.726 --> 01:34:52.387]  I mean, I think he's done a phenomenal job.
[01:34:52.407 --> 01:34:54.328]  They're blaming everybody but China.
[01:34:54.588 --> 01:34:59.851]  Trump is making America great again, while China, they're making viruses great again.
[01:34:59.911 --> 01:35:07.436]  And don't forget, when Trump did the State of the Union speech, he mentioned coronavirus, aka Chinese virus, and Pelosi ripped up his speech.
[01:35:07.576 --> 01:35:07.836]  Yeah.
[01:35:08.136 --> 01:35:10.518]  I mean, who really loves America and who hates America?
[01:35:10.598 --> 01:35:10.758]  Yeah.
[01:35:11.974 --> 01:35:12.796]  Well, absolutely.
[01:35:12.816 --> 01:35:19.391]  I don't see Americans buying that Trump's a racist or that Trump's behind the virus when there's no evidence.
[01:35:19.431 --> 01:35:20.514]  I see that backfiring.
[01:35:20.534 --> 01:35:21.155]  What do you guys see?
[01:35:22.128 --> 01:35:24.489]  Well, there's a lot of idiots in this country.
[01:35:24.590 --> 01:35:26.831]  I mean, look back at this past election.
[01:35:27.471 --> 01:35:29.452]  Hillary actually won the popular vote.
[01:35:29.813 --> 01:35:31.073]  How dumb is this country?
[01:35:31.554 --> 01:35:33.255]  There's a lot of fools out there, Alex.
[01:35:33.375 --> 01:35:35.656]  Hey, Alex, thank God for the Electoral College.
[01:35:36.897 --> 01:35:37.858]  No, I hear you.
[01:35:37.918 --> 01:35:42.420]  And now Hillary says they're going to challenge, she's the boss, the election no matter what.
[01:35:43.621 --> 01:35:46.103]  Now we learned that Mattis had a coup plan against Trump.
[01:35:46.123 --> 01:35:46.663]  This is crazy.
[01:35:47.679 --> 01:35:48.219]  Right, yeah.
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:51.061]  And they're trying to steal this election with the mail-in ballots.
[01:35:51.461 --> 01:35:56.524]  I say, hey, if y'all so confident with the mail-in ballots, go ahead and mail in your ballots.
[01:35:56.605 --> 01:36:00.347]  Us conservatives, Republicans, I'm going to show up and I'm going to make my vote personally.
[01:36:00.547 --> 01:36:01.728]  Yeah, because I'm a patriot.
[01:36:01.868 --> 01:36:03.649]  I'm going to make sure my vote is counted.
[01:36:03.669 --> 01:36:09.432]  Well, Trump made the point that, just as you just said, that I hope they're not voting twice.
[01:36:09.452 --> 01:36:11.954]  Well, now we know all over the country where they've been doing it.
[01:36:11.994 --> 01:36:13.375]  Democrats, it's mainly Democrats.
[01:36:14.411 --> 01:36:15.291]  Because they don't care about the law.
[01:36:15.631 --> 01:36:18.392]  They're voting via mail and then going in and voting at the polling place.
[01:36:19.772 --> 01:36:20.053]  Right.
[01:36:21.093 --> 01:36:21.993]  That could easily happen.
[01:36:22.153 --> 01:36:24.214]  That's come out of all the special elections.
[01:36:25.254 --> 01:36:26.674]  Michigan, you name it, it's been happening.
[01:36:27.575 --> 01:36:36.657]  Yeah, I mean, how can you keep track of... I mean, I can keep track of what my left and right hand are doing, but you can't keep track of what's going on if you're mailing in a vote and then you're going in to vote.
[01:36:37.222 --> 01:36:40.643]  I mean, it's just going to open up so much fraud in this next election.
[01:36:40.903 --> 01:36:45.685]  And if there's a lot of mail-in votes, I mean, the election's not going to be determined that night.
[01:36:45.885 --> 01:36:47.326]  It's going to take weeks and months.
[01:36:48.106 --> 01:36:48.826]  Well, that was the plan.
[01:36:48.866 --> 01:36:53.248]  The Democrats admit by having 80 million mail-ins, it's going to gum it up and they're just going to challenge it.
[01:36:53.288 --> 01:36:59.590]  And now the media is working with Zuckerberg and Facebook and Google to say they're not going to let us say we think Trump won.
[01:36:59.991 --> 01:37:00.931]  That is so dangerous.
[01:37:03.573 --> 01:37:04.353]  I can see it coming.
[01:37:04.493 --> 01:37:08.754]  I mean, what they said about that kid, Rittenhouse, who just self-defense.
[01:37:08.894 --> 01:37:11.394]  Anybody that talks about that, the veto goes down.
[01:37:11.695 --> 01:37:15.115]  But you call him a mass murderer, it goes viral on Facebook.
[01:37:15.175 --> 01:37:16.155]  It doesn't make any sense.
[01:37:16.295 --> 01:37:17.416]  Well, that's what Facebook said.
[01:37:17.476 --> 01:37:22.316]  They said last week, as you know, they said, we've determined he's a mass murderer.
[01:37:22.377 --> 01:37:22.917]  So did Twitter.
[01:37:23.297 --> 01:37:25.357]  So his lawyer can't speak for him.
[01:37:25.597 --> 01:37:26.717]  They're blocking his lawyer.
[01:37:26.977 --> 01:37:29.038]  So now even your lawyer doesn't have speech.
[01:37:29.078 --> 01:37:30.118]  That violates the Constitution.
[01:37:31.181 --> 01:37:35.443]  Oh yeah, and don't forget, there's a video of Gavin Newsom out of California.
[01:37:35.783 --> 01:37:43.627]  He's got a video up on Facebook clearly stating that Trump called Mexicans and immigrants, what's the term he called?
[01:37:43.667 --> 01:37:44.307]  Rapists.
[01:37:44.387 --> 01:37:45.368]  Rapists and murderers.
[01:37:45.468 --> 01:37:52.091]  When they know good and well there was a doctored video where they took it out of context and he was referring to MS-13 gang.
[01:37:52.411 --> 01:37:53.812]  Nobody fact-checked that video.
[01:37:53.832 --> 01:37:55.673]  That video is still up with millions of views.
[01:37:57.898 --> 01:38:04.403]  Guys, I could ask a thousand questions and I've got a thousand questions, but what's front and center for you guys to win this election and save the country?
[01:38:05.563 --> 01:38:08.025]  Man, I guess we cannot become complacent.
[01:38:08.205 --> 01:38:13.008]  I mean, if you are physically fit, go out and vote.
[01:38:13.449 --> 01:38:19.793]  If you have any, like, pre-existing issues and you don't feel safe going out to vote, take precautions.
[01:38:19.893 --> 01:38:21.554]  But this election is so important.
[01:38:21.574 --> 01:38:22.215]  These people
[01:38:23.075 --> 01:38:26.860]  People are sitting back saying that, you know, it doesn't matter who's in office.
[01:38:27.221 --> 01:38:30.886]  No, you've got grown folks deciding on how you and your kids are going to live.
[01:38:30.946 --> 01:38:31.867]  Don't be a child.
[01:38:32.388 --> 01:38:33.089]  Make a decision.
[01:38:33.149 --> 01:38:38.876]  Make sure you show up and vote, especially if you are... Well, communism is a lot more dangerous than the coronavirus, and I agree.
[01:38:38.896 --> 01:38:40.158]  People better knock on doors.
[01:38:40.999 --> 01:38:44.681]  And they better get, because they know conservatives will tend to follow directives when we're trying to work together.
[01:38:45.141 --> 01:38:46.582]  And they know liberals will violate rules.
[01:38:46.602 --> 01:38:48.683]  That's why they're doing the lockdown to keep us from voting.
[01:38:49.083 --> 01:38:49.963]  Don't just go vote.
[01:38:49.983 --> 01:38:51.244]  Bring everybody with you.
[01:38:51.724 --> 01:38:53.265]  Get them registered now.
[01:38:53.565 --> 01:38:54.325]  How many days left?
[01:38:54.385 --> 01:38:56.166]  Only a few days left in most areas to get registered.
[01:38:57.006 --> 01:38:57.847]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:57.907 --> 01:38:59.508]  My whole entire family is registered.
[01:38:59.628 --> 01:39:00.108]  I'm ready.
[01:39:00.408 --> 01:39:00.948]  I'm ready.
[01:39:01.068 --> 01:39:02.209]  I'm ready to rock and roll.
[01:39:02.809 --> 01:39:03.830]  This is D-Day for me.
[01:39:04.110 --> 01:39:05.370]  Yeah.
[01:39:05.410 --> 01:39:06.051]  World War III.
[01:39:06.111 --> 01:39:07.571]  Let me ask you both that question.
[01:39:07.631 --> 01:39:08.972]  What is Trump going to do if he gets re-elected?
[01:39:10.586 --> 01:39:11.947]  I think he did an amazing job.
[01:39:12.007 --> 01:39:17.772]  I think he just continued to keep his pace, continue to beat Donald Trump, and do what he's been doing for the past four years.
[01:39:17.812 --> 01:39:18.893]  He's putting America first.
[01:39:18.913 --> 01:39:24.378]  And I think if, hopefully he does get re-elected, I think then he's not going to have to worry about being re-elected.
[01:39:24.798 --> 01:39:27.861]  He's going to really show what a leader should be doing.
[01:39:27.881 --> 01:39:29.783]  Like this whole stuff, these protests, yeah.
[01:39:29.803 --> 01:39:30.543]  I hope he wins.
[01:39:30.583 --> 01:39:31.424]  He just has to be himself.
[01:39:31.444 --> 01:39:33.125]  That's why everybody gravitates towards him.
[01:39:34.150 --> 01:39:37.191]  I hope he wins this one, but I'm already worrying about four years from now.
[01:39:38.532 --> 01:39:41.773]  I'm like, what happens when he's like 80 years old?
[01:39:43.114 --> 01:39:49.797]  I mean, hopefully this is the foundation, this conservatives on the right needs, and we'll just use it as a stepping stone.
[01:39:49.837 --> 01:39:50.257]  Exactly.
[01:39:50.317 --> 01:39:55.599]  He takes over, we take over the Republican Party, and it's now an Americana 1776 Trump deal.
[01:39:55.979 --> 01:39:56.840]  There you go.
[01:39:56.860 --> 01:39:57.900]  There you go.
[01:39:58.020 --> 01:40:00.001]  You just put chills on my spine now.
[01:40:00.161 --> 01:40:02.182]  And we put the Hodge brothers both in the U.S.
[01:40:02.202 --> 01:40:02.502]  Senate.
[01:40:04.004 --> 01:40:04.584]  There you go.
[01:40:05.084 --> 01:40:05.925]  And then the presidency.
[01:40:05.965 --> 01:40:06.985]  I voted for governor.
[01:40:08.145 --> 01:40:11.726]  And then whichever one of you guys gets elected president later, the other guy can body double for him.
[01:40:13.007 --> 01:40:17.948]  I tell you what, if I ever ran for any kind of office, I'm telling you, all kinds of stuff is coming out.
[01:40:18.588 --> 01:40:19.808]  I see what they did to Trump.
[01:40:19.968 --> 01:40:21.809]  Can you imagine what they're going to do to my black ass?
[01:40:24.170 --> 01:40:26.910]  Believe me, the stuff they said about me almost... That's not true.
[01:40:27.190 --> 01:40:28.251]  Yeah, none of it's true.
[01:40:28.471 --> 01:40:29.951]  Nothing they said about me is true yet.
[01:40:30.011 --> 01:40:31.532]  Thank God they hadn't found out about the real stuff.
[01:40:35.017 --> 01:40:35.617]  I'm good to go.
[01:40:53.837 --> 01:41:01.304]  You know, the level of brainwashing and censorship going on by big tech has gotten crazier.
[01:41:01.324 --> 01:41:06.810]  They censor the president, they censor everybody, they've been, I know, been censoring the Hodge twins some, but they even have
[01:41:08.562 --> 01:41:09.243]  We're good to go.
[01:41:30.123 --> 01:41:34.767]  Saying it's a fake photo that she looks like Marilyn Monroe, but then that's a real photo of her.
[01:41:34.847 --> 01:41:43.573]  So, now we can't even say, why do these health directors look like they've been smoking boatloads of crack or drinking Drano or something.
[01:41:43.613 --> 01:41:49.217]  I mean, that level of us not even being able to objectively say that, to me is just crazy.
[01:41:49.257 --> 01:41:49.978]  What do you guys think of that?
[01:41:51.139 --> 01:41:55.562]  I mean, she definitely needs something.
[01:41:59.924 --> 01:42:00.744]  Absolutely, guys.
[01:42:00.904 --> 01:42:02.204]  We got the Hodge twins with us.
[01:42:02.545 --> 01:42:19.028]  One of you guys, I think your mics might be still muted, but speaking of gaslighting people, telling people that we can't believe our eyes, Nadler says that there is no such thing as Antifa burning down these cities and shooting everybody and doing this.
[01:42:19.368 --> 01:42:20.448]  So I wanted to ask what you thought of him.
[01:42:20.488 --> 01:42:20.828]  Here he is.
[01:42:21.888 --> 01:42:22.468]  It is true.
[01:42:22.508 --> 01:42:23.549]  There's violence across the whole country.
[01:42:23.569 --> 01:42:24.869]  Do you disavow the violence from Antifa?
[01:42:25.996 --> 01:42:27.797]  That's happening in Portland right now?
[01:42:27.897 --> 01:42:31.580]  That's a myth that's being spread only in Washington, D.C.
[01:42:31.700 --> 01:42:32.981]  About Antifa in Portland?
[01:42:33.101 --> 01:42:33.381]  Yes.
[01:42:33.621 --> 01:42:35.363]  Sir, there's videos everywhere online.
[01:42:35.383 --> 01:42:36.644]  There's fires and riots.
[01:42:36.824 --> 01:42:40.346]  So gentlemen, we forget that they're saying things like that.
[01:42:40.806 --> 01:42:41.667]  What do you make of that?
[01:42:42.848 --> 01:42:48.152]  I mean, why would anybody listen to a guy that pulls his pants right up under his nipples and he walks like that?
[01:42:48.172 --> 01:42:52.775]  I mean, he's gotta be
[01:42:57.694 --> 01:42:58.194]  Alright, listen.
[01:42:58.454 --> 01:43:04.198]  Guys, you guys are great, but the Hodge twin in blue, because I get twins mixed up, I think your mic is muted.
[01:43:04.238 --> 01:43:05.098]  It's not coming through.
[01:43:06.259 --> 01:43:07.520]  So slap it a couple times.
[01:43:07.540 --> 01:43:08.721]  It's just like when my mic doesn't work.
[01:43:09.601 --> 01:43:09.801]  Right.
[01:43:10.462 --> 01:43:10.982]  Is it working now?
[01:43:11.002 --> 01:43:11.482]  You hear me now?
[01:43:11.682 --> 01:43:12.243]  Yes, sir!
[01:43:12.303 --> 01:43:13.063]  Sorry, start again.
[01:43:13.083 --> 01:43:15.224]  It actually just peaked my interest.
[01:43:15.244 --> 01:43:15.525]  Tell me.
[01:43:16.465 --> 01:43:22.108]  Yeah, I'm thinking anybody that pulls his pants up around his nipples that high, you can't listen to him about anything.
[01:43:22.169 --> 01:43:23.649]  He loses all credibility.
[01:43:23.950 --> 01:43:24.170]  Yeah.
[01:43:25.399 --> 01:43:29.242]  To say that Antifa or these rides is false.
[01:43:29.302 --> 01:43:30.804]  I mean, everybody has two eyes.
[01:43:30.964 --> 01:43:34.267]  Even Ray Charles and Stevie Wonder can see that.
[01:43:35.027 --> 01:43:38.450]  Yeah, I mean, I've said this many times.
[01:43:39.031 --> 01:43:46.958]  Anybody that's on the left, they're not very bright because if you look at both sides, you wouldn't be on the left.
[01:43:47.338 --> 01:43:47.578]  Yeah.
[01:43:47.818 --> 01:43:48.239]  It's like
[01:43:49.617 --> 01:43:54.738]  It's got, these people are like brain dead to believe that Antifa does not exist.
[01:43:55.058 --> 01:43:56.519]  Yeah, or these riots did not happen.
[01:43:56.579 --> 01:44:02.180]  I mean, you have to be mentally, intellectually weak not to be able to think for yourself and take this man for his word.
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:03.760]  Yeah, and that's the constituents on the left.
[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:05.320]  They are intellectually weak.
[01:44:05.460 --> 01:44:05.981]  They're sheep.
[01:44:06.021 --> 01:44:08.541]  They just go by whatever the TV tells them to do.
[01:44:08.901 --> 01:44:13.402]  And that's why they have these people because mainstream media is all over every channel.
[01:44:13.462 --> 01:44:16.683]  They have the upper hand and these people fall prey to them.
[01:44:17.123 --> 01:44:17.263]  Yeah.
[01:44:18.385 --> 01:44:20.527]  I'm going to tell you something right now and you're not a sponsor.
[01:44:20.967 --> 01:44:21.908]  I'm saying this and I believe it.
[01:44:22.028 --> 01:44:25.150]  I'm going to get a blue shirt and a red shirt and one of those hats.
[01:44:25.570 --> 01:44:27.071]  Because they look great and I love what you're doing.
[01:44:27.111 --> 01:44:30.294]  How do I get one of these awesome Hodge twins shirts or hats?
[01:44:31.744 --> 01:44:35.065]  Our website is official, hawkstwins.com.
[01:44:35.085 --> 01:44:36.425]  We even throw in a sale, Alex.
[01:44:36.465 --> 01:44:37.625]  You get 20% off.
[01:44:38.065 --> 01:44:40.946]  Just use discount code CHINESEVIRUS.
[01:44:41.646 --> 01:44:43.666]  Are you serious?
[01:44:43.706 --> 01:44:44.807]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:44:44.827 --> 01:44:47.047]  We call it Chinese because it comes from China.
[01:44:47.447 --> 01:44:47.887]  Exactly.
[01:44:47.907 --> 01:44:49.047]  You make your t-shirts great again.
[01:44:49.067 --> 01:44:50.808]  Well, let me throw this in there.
[01:44:50.828 --> 01:44:55.969]  If you read back the Clinton Foundation, not the new foundation, their original foundation that became the library,
[01:44:57.589 --> 01:45:08.853]  World Net Daily sued and got documents that said in there back in like 1993 when they got elected, they said, we can't let conservatives ever have merchandise or books or films of their own culture because it's more popular.
[01:45:09.113 --> 01:45:12.054]  We've got to bankrupt anybody tries to fund themselves.
[01:45:12.355 --> 01:45:18.677]  And so that's why you guys being successful and you guys making great stuff and you guys getting bigger is all of us getting bigger.
[01:45:19.017 --> 01:45:20.097]  So I just love what you're doing.
[01:45:20.117 --> 01:45:21.318]  How do folks find everything you're doing?
[01:45:22.611 --> 01:45:30.594]  Well, they can follow us on Facebook at TheHodgeTwins, Instagram OfficialHodgeTwins, Twitter HodgeTwins, and on YouTube, ConservativeTwins.
[01:45:30.934 --> 01:45:31.154]  Yeah.
[01:45:31.334 --> 01:45:35.976]  Well, you guys have been blowing up for a while, but your growth rate right now, you'll be bigger than Joe Rogan in six months.
[01:45:37.216 --> 01:45:39.097]  Yeah, I wish Joe Rogan would let me come on his show!
[01:45:40.297 --> 01:45:42.678]  Well, he lives down the street now, but I'm not going to have to go talk to him.
[01:45:42.698 --> 01:45:43.178]  Yeah, I hear you.
[01:45:43.899 --> 01:45:44.119]  Yeah.
[01:45:45.119 --> 01:45:47.560]  Yeah, he moved to Texas, he got the hell out of that damn California.
[01:45:49.012 --> 01:45:49.933]  Got the hell out of there.
[01:45:50.133 --> 01:45:53.815]  He probably started adding up how much taxes he's paying every month to his state, so you know what?
[01:45:53.916 --> 01:45:54.816]  This is not freedom.
[01:45:55.196 --> 01:45:55.997]  I'm going to Texas.
[01:45:56.397 --> 01:45:57.158]  Took him long enough.
[01:45:57.498 --> 01:45:58.879]  You know, he should have you guys on.
[01:45:58.899 --> 01:45:58.979]  Yeah.
[01:46:00.040 --> 01:46:02.141]  Well, I just love having you here.
[01:46:02.181 --> 01:46:04.643]  Now, I could ask a lot of questions, but let me get into this.
[01:46:04.683 --> 01:46:08.585]  I'm sure you saw Kaitlyn Bennett at Central Florida University in Orlando.
[01:46:09.846 --> 01:46:13.529]  Just like Rittenhouse is being chased down, but they chased her down and began to attack her bodyguards.
[01:46:13.889 --> 01:46:14.910]  I mean, this is getting scary.
[01:46:16.755 --> 01:46:21.959]  Yeah, it's just people on the left, man, it's came to a point that they don't want to debate.
[01:46:22.059 --> 01:46:23.219]  They don't have a discussion.
[01:46:23.340 --> 01:46:24.921]  It's either my way or the highway.
[01:46:25.061 --> 01:46:28.743]  And that's pretty sad because we both need people on the left and the right.
[01:46:28.863 --> 01:46:30.525]  I mean, we're never going to agree on everything.
[01:46:30.605 --> 01:46:36.909]  But at this point in time in society, nobody wants to listen on the left or take any criticism.
[01:46:36.949 --> 01:46:38.350]  Hey, Alex, you know what's crazy?
[01:46:38.991 --> 01:46:44.155]  The Democrats, back in the 50s and 60s, you know the segregation and Jim Crow laws attacking people?
[01:46:44.475 --> 01:46:44.675]  Yeah.
[01:46:44.895 --> 01:46:49.539]  It's crazy as hell now that they're doing it in 2020 against just conservatives.
[01:46:49.819 --> 01:46:51.520]  Yeah, or anybody that thinks different from them.
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:53.061]  They're doing the exact same tactics.
[01:46:53.081 --> 01:46:54.442]  It's the exact same thing.
[01:46:54.502 --> 01:47:03.629]  Like, I've seen Black Lives Matter, and there's white people walking with them, in unison, supporting Black Lives Matter, and then these black people go up to, like,
[01:47:04.494 --> 01:47:09.036]  Elderly white people get sitting, eating at a restaurant, attacking them, eating their food off the plate.
[01:47:09.296 --> 01:47:10.236]  This is what happened.
[01:47:10.997 --> 01:47:13.418]  That's why Martin Luther King was so important.
[01:47:13.678 --> 01:47:15.639]  And now here we are in 2020.
[01:47:16.139 --> 01:47:18.020]  Democrats are doing the exact same thing.
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:20.581]  And it still amazes me that they're pushing this.
[01:47:20.741 --> 01:47:29.925]  I mean, anybody with two eyes and a brain, you should be able to look up for yourself on Google and clearly see that these statistics do not support
[01:47:30.461 --> 01:47:32.682]  Police officers hunting down black men like animals.
[01:47:32.722 --> 01:47:38.063]  You're more likely, a police officer, a white police officer is way more likely to die to a black dude.
[01:47:38.423 --> 01:47:38.703]  Yeah.
[01:47:39.163 --> 01:47:40.843]  In almost 1801.
[01:47:41.223 --> 01:47:49.145]  But statistically speaking, black men are being hunted down by black men and they refuse to acknowledge that fact.
[01:47:50.706 --> 01:47:51.626]  So where does it go?
[01:47:51.666 --> 01:47:52.286]  Where does it end?
[01:47:52.306 --> 01:47:54.507]  What happens if Trump... I agree.
[01:47:54.567 --> 01:47:56.327]  God forbid, what happens if Trump loses?
[01:47:58.365 --> 01:48:01.886]  All of us just going to have to remain strong and keep spreading our voice and keep fighting.
[01:48:02.046 --> 01:48:02.987]  That's all we can do.
[01:48:03.687 --> 01:48:05.487]  I'm definitely not going to give up like a liberal.
[01:48:07.288 --> 01:48:08.348]  Just keep fighting, Alex.
[01:48:08.488 --> 01:48:09.149]  Just keep fighting.
[01:48:09.169 --> 01:48:10.509]  We're going to keep doing what we're doing.
[01:48:10.969 --> 01:48:12.050]  Keep doing what you're doing.
[01:48:12.470 --> 01:48:14.210]  All those pictures, you're just going to fight together.
[01:48:14.230 --> 01:48:14.891]  And you know what, Alex?
[01:48:14.951 --> 01:48:18.172]  Sometimes you got to take two steps back before you can take two steps forward.
[01:48:18.272 --> 01:48:22.453]  If that should happen, I'm not going to stop putting out... No, no, I totally agree.
[01:48:22.493 --> 01:48:27.275]  In a sick way, I don't want Trump to lose, but if they did, it'll be so bad on the left, that'll be...
[01:48:28.712 --> 01:48:31.733]  I mean, it'll definitely be over if we survive.
[01:48:33.013 --> 01:48:35.294]  Yeah, I mean we're facing Facebook censorship.
[01:48:35.354 --> 01:48:40.076]  Our Facebook page is facing being unpublished because they say what we're saying is hate speech.
[01:48:42.237 --> 01:48:43.437]  I mean, hate speech is...
[01:48:44.002 --> 01:48:45.002]  I mean, it's crazy.
[01:48:45.042 --> 01:48:47.623]  Just because you hate hearing it doesn't make it hate speak.
[01:48:47.843 --> 01:48:48.263]  Yes.
[01:48:49.063 --> 01:48:57.066]  Well, I watch you guys every day, and so does my son, and you guys are very well-spoken and very friendly and very jovial and very positive, but that's why they don't like you.
[01:48:57.086 --> 01:48:58.266]  Because the truth is, it's not hate.
[01:48:58.686 --> 01:49:00.147]  It's popular and it's true.
[01:49:00.167 --> 01:49:01.547]  They don't like what's true.
[01:49:01.827 --> 01:49:05.688]  They don't like what's popular, because they're selling global tyranny.
[01:49:05.948 --> 01:49:07.349]  The Hodge twins are our guest.
[01:49:07.369 --> 01:49:08.049]  I want to come back.
[01:49:08.962 --> 01:49:12.806]  And play some clips for them and get their take on what they think Trump ought to do.
[01:49:12.826 --> 01:49:14.447]  Because Trump does listen to them, I can tell you.
[01:49:14.807 --> 01:49:15.488]  Trump listens to us.
[01:49:15.528 --> 01:49:16.389]  He listens to all of us.
[01:49:16.789 --> 01:49:23.015]  What do we want to see Trump do next with 52 days out to really get on the offense and ensure this win?
[01:49:23.035 --> 01:49:25.617]  Because this race is close because of election fraud.
[01:49:26.097 --> 01:49:27.339]  We'll be right back with the Hodge Twins.
[01:49:27.399 --> 01:49:29.200]  I'm Alex Jones, NewsWars.com.
[01:49:57.690 --> 01:49:59.391]  Well, the Hodge twins are here!
[01:50:00.952 --> 01:50:03.814]  They were getting into how they're starting to be censored by Facebook and their platforms.
[01:50:04.394 --> 01:50:05.214]  Election meddling.
[01:50:05.234 --> 01:50:07.716]  Gentlemen, I got a hundred questions and then a hundred more.
[01:50:08.837 --> 01:50:09.017]  But...
[01:50:09.872 --> 01:50:13.113]  With all that's going on in the world, you hit on something.
[01:50:13.293 --> 01:50:19.015]  I know you don't take pleasure in it, and neither do I. The liberals I used to know were anti-offensive war.
[01:50:19.055 --> 01:50:20.435]  Well, Trump's getting us out of all these wars.
[01:50:20.995 --> 01:50:23.696]  The liberals I used to know wanted to empower the average people.
[01:50:23.716 --> 01:50:24.536]  Well, Trump's trying to do that.
[01:50:25.177 --> 01:50:29.138]  The new liberal is not the liberal I knew 30 years ago, 20 years ago.
[01:50:29.178 --> 01:50:32.179]  They're like a crazed demon that's super stupid.
[01:50:33.319 --> 01:50:36.000]  So you were making that point about how weird they are.
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:39.541]  What do you think happened to America, or what happened to these people?
[01:50:41.457 --> 01:50:45.602]  They're leftist now, but you know what shifted everything?
[01:50:46.303 --> 01:50:52.250]  Was when politicians and the mainstream media got on TV and called our president a white supremacist.
[01:50:53.918 --> 01:50:56.539]  That the red hat was the new KKK hood.
[01:50:57.019 --> 01:51:00.140]  That's very powerful for somebody to see and hear.
[01:51:00.340 --> 01:51:00.600]  That's right.
[01:51:00.620 --> 01:51:00.840]  That's it.
[01:51:01.060 --> 01:51:06.921]  Because when they see people on the news, they say, this person is somebody of power.
[01:51:06.981 --> 01:51:07.842]  I should listen to him.
[01:51:07.902 --> 01:51:08.522]  He's on TV.
[01:51:08.542 --> 01:51:09.222]  He's in a suit.
[01:51:09.542 --> 01:51:10.882]  So they take that word for it.
[01:51:11.122 --> 01:51:13.083]  And they don't realize that they're being lied to.
[01:51:13.423 --> 01:51:15.964]  That's why the liberals are no longer liberal.
[01:51:15.984 --> 01:51:16.444]  They're leftist.
[01:51:18.487 --> 01:51:24.613]  How irresponsible for another politician, a member of our government, that's supposed to be working in tandem as a team.
[01:51:24.753 --> 01:51:25.053]  Yeah.
[01:51:26.034 --> 01:51:27.476]  How can yet person
[01:51:28.288 --> 01:51:43.578]  After the oath they've taken, stand there on TV and call a man a racist, when he's your boss, when y'all should be working together, when you have absolutely no proof that this man is a racist, and say those things on TV, and they say Trump is the bad guy.
[01:51:43.758 --> 01:51:44.839]  He's the provocateur.
[01:51:45.159 --> 01:51:45.499]  Yeah.
[01:51:45.799 --> 01:51:48.401]  This man's been in the public eye for decades.
[01:51:48.901 --> 01:51:50.622]  And you can't find anything on this man.
[01:51:50.662 --> 01:51:56.166]  He bought up all the golf courses that, hard to believe, didn't allow black people and Jews on them, and he opened it up!
[01:51:56.606 --> 01:51:57.627]  He did the opposite!
[01:51:58.413 --> 01:52:02.075]  He's got wards from Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton for helping black folks.
[01:52:02.596 --> 01:52:04.337]  But overnight, he's running for president.
[01:52:04.377 --> 01:52:05.938]  Now he's a white supremacist.
[01:52:05.978 --> 01:52:07.619]  Not only that, he's a Nazi.
[01:52:08.340 --> 01:52:12.763]  But I asked that question because I really didn't know the answer, and you guys just spelled it out.
[01:52:12.923 --> 01:52:22.549]  It's the leadership, Nancy Pelosi, Maxine Waters, Michael Moore, Bill Clinton, all of them, Obama, saying Trump is a white supremacist.
[01:52:22.569 --> 01:52:25.911]  Well, people then believe the authority figure and believe this is a Nazi.
[01:52:26.272 --> 01:52:27.953]  So she says, if you see him, go after him.
[01:52:28.653 --> 01:52:30.475]  Well, now that's what's happening, and so you're right.
[01:52:30.595 --> 01:52:34.018]  It's the leadership of the Democrats that are commanding this and doing it all.
[01:52:34.919 --> 01:52:37.442]  Yeah, Maxine Waters, she said it herself.
[01:52:37.562 --> 01:52:38.362]  Get in their face.
[01:52:38.683 --> 01:52:40.484]  They come to your restaurant, throw them out.
[01:52:41.145 --> 01:52:42.406]  Let them know you know they're there.
[01:52:42.506 --> 01:52:44.428]  I mean, this all started from the left.
[01:52:44.909 --> 01:52:47.371]  But every day when you turn on mainstream media,
[01:52:48.411 --> 01:52:49.712]  Everything's Trump's fault.
[01:52:49.852 --> 01:52:50.072]  Yeah.
[01:52:50.492 --> 01:52:50.992]  Everything!
[01:52:51.472 --> 01:53:00.716]  The coronavirus, the Chinese virus, the riots, the people, the rates rising, the murders in our inner cities, and all the crime that's being committed.
[01:53:01.016 --> 01:53:06.018]  It's Trump's fault when everybody that's committing those crimes are progressives and liberals.
[01:53:06.358 --> 01:53:08.058]  They live in these liberal shitholes.
[01:53:08.439 --> 01:53:10.159]  Yeah, but it's a Republican's fault.
[01:53:10.439 --> 01:53:14.461]  A man who's only been in office a little under four years, the things he's accomplished.
[01:53:14.481 --> 01:53:14.661]  Yeah.
[01:53:14.821 --> 01:53:22.985]  You have been voting for these Democrats for years and nothing in your life has changed, but it's one man's fault who's been in office a little under four years.
[01:53:23.245 --> 01:53:25.346]  It makes absolutely no sense.
[01:53:25.586 --> 01:53:26.526]  Well, that's the thing for me.
[01:53:26.546 --> 01:53:29.167]  I don't even like defending somebody as much as I defend Trump.
[01:53:29.187 --> 01:53:31.608]  It feels weird, but he just keeps telling the truth.
[01:53:31.748 --> 01:53:32.489]  I know the facts.
[01:53:33.069 --> 01:53:37.754]  The guy's super truthful, he's got incredible energy, and they keep lying about him.
[01:53:37.774 --> 01:53:41.417]  So I find myself just totally rooting for him and really freaked out.
[01:53:41.477 --> 01:53:46.162]  I saw him almost start crying yesterday in Michigan when everybody was saying, we love you, we love you.
[01:53:46.582 --> 01:53:48.064]  You know, he needs that support.
[01:53:48.084 --> 01:53:52.568]  Could you imagine being 74 and surrounded by all these people and what this is like?
[01:53:52.628 --> 01:53:54.190]  I mean, my God, we need to pray for President Trump.
[01:53:55.148 --> 01:54:03.333]  Yeah, I mean, to be under attack every day on TV, Twitter, he's traveling all over the world to keep this movement going.
[01:54:03.534 --> 01:54:06.195]  And the snakes inside the White House that are backstabbing?
[01:54:07.116 --> 01:54:11.919]  Yeah, I mean, it's crazy what this man's going through, and he's still standing tall for us all.
[01:54:12.039 --> 01:54:18.924]  And he's going to his rallies, and the man is so sharp, and then you look at Joe Biden, it's like night and day.
[01:54:20.824 --> 01:54:25.447]  It's amazing how Joe Biden has the support he does.
[01:54:25.807 --> 01:54:26.768]  That's my next question.
[01:54:26.928 --> 01:54:28.429]  What were they thinking with Joe Biden?
[01:54:28.489 --> 01:54:30.931]  I mean, he is degenerating quickly.
[01:54:32.232 --> 01:54:34.053]  Yeah, that's the thing, man.
[01:54:34.073 --> 01:54:34.814]  They ain't thinking.
[01:54:35.234 --> 01:54:38.136]  I mean, it's like the liberals lost their mind.
[01:54:38.657 --> 01:54:43.120]  It's just, they think the only way they can beat Trump is Joe Biden, which is pretty sad.
[01:54:43.140 --> 01:54:44.581]  Let me use this analogy.
[01:54:44.661 --> 01:54:46.603]  It's like putting Mike Tyson in 1988.
[01:54:48.709 --> 01:54:50.610]  In the ring with a guy in a wheelchair.
[01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:57.794]  I mean, this is like, mentally, Trump's like Mike Tyson in his prime, and Biden's like an 80-year-old man who doesn't even know what planet he's on.
[01:54:58.634 --> 01:55:00.035]  Yeah, that's putting it nice, Alex.
[01:55:00.775 --> 01:55:05.257]  And he chooses his VP as somebody nobody likes, not even black people like her.
[01:55:05.617 --> 01:55:05.818]  Yeah.
[01:55:06.458 --> 01:55:09.039]  I was about to say, she pulled the lowest with black people.
[01:55:09.439 --> 01:55:10.340]  Why the hell did they pick her?
[01:55:13.243 --> 01:55:16.884]  The liberal, the modern liberal Alex does not think.
[01:55:17.104 --> 01:55:20.105]  Yeah, they only picked her because she's supposedly black.
[01:55:20.185 --> 01:55:20.985]  She's not black.
[01:55:21.485 --> 01:55:23.766]  She's Indian, but she is not black.
[01:55:23.966 --> 01:55:26.046]  She bought as black as Sean King, Alex.
[01:55:27.947 --> 01:55:28.687]  I was gonna ask that.
[01:55:29.107 --> 01:55:39.409]  What is up with Sean King and Denzel, all these weirdos that obviously are, have not black, and they say they are, and it comes out that they're not, and they go, well I identify as that.
[01:55:39.449 --> 01:55:41.410]  I guess it's like men identifying as women or whatever.
[01:55:42.455 --> 01:55:42.675]  Yeah.
[01:55:42.775 --> 01:55:45.799]  Yeah, you know what, and Trevor Noah brought that up on his podcast.
[01:55:46.139 --> 01:55:48.722]  He said it's okay for a child to pick his gender.
[01:55:49.083 --> 01:55:49.323]  Yeah.
[01:55:49.603 --> 01:55:51.926]  But it's not okay for somebody to pick their race.
[01:55:52.026 --> 01:55:55.830]  Yeah, a grown adult identifying as another race, that's a lie.
[01:55:56.051 --> 01:56:00.616]  But a child at 6, 7 years old can pick their own gender, that's not a lie.
[01:56:01.224 --> 01:56:05.647]  I mean, everybody in Hollywood, celebrities, football players, they do not think.
[01:56:05.947 --> 01:56:12.371]  And the only reason why these people are on your TV is because some leftists, they're pushing their agenda.
[01:56:12.412 --> 01:56:15.514]  Yeah, you can't pick your gender, you can't pick your race.
[01:56:15.934 --> 01:56:16.154]  Yeah.
[01:56:16.334 --> 01:56:20.217]  If you can pick your gender, I would say you could pick your race if you wanted to.
[01:56:20.477 --> 01:56:20.677]  Yeah.
[01:56:20.777 --> 01:56:23.639]  But at the end of the day, you can't pick your gender and you can't pick your race.
[01:56:23.799 --> 01:56:26.501]  And I'm like thinking, Alex, who is making these rules?
[01:56:27.626 --> 01:56:35.231]  Some satanic worshiping leftists in Hollywood, some elite is putting, making all these stupid, ridiculous rules.
[01:56:35.491 --> 01:56:36.772]  Makes absolutely no sense.
[01:56:36.792 --> 01:56:37.572]  No, I totally agree.
[01:56:37.592 --> 01:56:38.673]  But you look at Sean King.
[01:56:38.733 --> 01:56:40.214]  I mean, he is fake, man.
[01:56:40.234 --> 01:56:44.797]  I mean, Trevor Noah grew his hair out like he's locked in his house.
[01:56:44.817 --> 01:56:46.558]  They're in a lockdown as if he is now.
[01:56:46.598 --> 01:56:50.441]  I mean, this is, and so did, uh, so did, uh, Colbert.
[01:56:50.501 --> 01:56:51.982]  I mean, it's just all fake.
[01:56:52.342 --> 01:56:52.842]  It's fake.
[01:56:53.002 --> 01:56:56.925]  But what's crazy is Alex, their fans, they don't see it.
[01:56:57.392 --> 01:56:57.592]  Yeah.
[01:56:57.752 --> 01:57:00.595]  It's like right there in the face, they don't even see it.
[01:57:00.655 --> 01:57:04.359]  It's like, I'm telling you, the voter that votes left now...
[01:57:05.600 --> 01:57:06.760]  They're not.
[01:57:07.001 --> 01:57:09.542]  They're capable of thinking for themselves.
[01:57:09.582 --> 01:57:11.862]  They just follow whatever the TV tells them.
[01:57:11.922 --> 01:57:17.204]  That's why a majority of people that are concerned from Republicans, they're business owners, they're leaders, they're capitalists.
[01:57:17.344 --> 01:57:18.465]  They think for themselves.
[01:57:18.525 --> 01:57:19.725]  They're entrepreneurs.
[01:57:19.765 --> 01:57:24.367]  People on the left, they think that this society is oppressing them.
[01:57:24.527 --> 01:57:27.548]  Well, if you're running your own business, you better know how stuff actually works.
[01:57:27.568 --> 01:57:28.329]  You're not going to be in business.
[01:57:29.629 --> 01:57:32.310]  Yeah, that's why Kamala Harris is so out of touch.
[01:57:32.330 --> 01:57:34.411]  That's why most of these Democrats are so out of touch.
[01:57:34.651 --> 01:57:37.011]  They can't function in real day-to-day society.
[01:57:37.352 --> 01:57:38.912]  They don't know how to run their own business.
[01:57:38.952 --> 01:57:39.832]  They wouldn't be able to.
[01:57:39.892 --> 01:57:44.534]  They just know how to lie and spew lies and make money off the taxpayers' back.
[01:57:44.794 --> 01:57:48.235]  Everybody should know, especially an entrepreneur or business owner, you cannot
[01:57:48.775 --> 01:57:53.718]  Invest millions of dollars, hundreds of thousands, or billions of dollars and be able to share that equally 50-50.
[01:57:53.758 --> 01:57:55.360]  Businesses do not work like that.
[01:57:55.680 --> 01:57:57.321]  Socialism does not work.
[01:57:57.361 --> 01:57:59.202]  Well sure, they'll talk about some billionaire's wealth.
[01:57:59.262 --> 01:58:01.704]  That's always in the business and all the infrastructure.
[01:58:02.144 --> 01:58:04.966]  All the real billionaires, like Elon Musk, he barely has any real cash.
[01:58:05.226 --> 01:58:06.427]  It's the value of his stock.
[01:58:06.767 --> 01:58:08.969]  If he tried to cash out 5%, he'd go bankrupt.
[01:58:10.049 --> 01:58:10.550]  Right, yeah.
[01:58:10.810 --> 01:58:12.551]  His business is inflated.
[01:58:14.181 --> 01:58:21.008]  Yeah, people don't know that, that like, that, that, that, you know, because like one time they said, Oh, Jones's business was valued in court case by 80 million.
[01:58:21.028 --> 01:58:22.550]  I had people going, you got $80 million?
[01:58:22.650 --> 01:58:24.271]  I go, I don't have $2 million.
[01:58:24.652 --> 01:58:25.853]  They value it at that.
[01:58:26.153 --> 01:58:27.675]  It doesn't mean it actually has that value.
[01:58:28.792 --> 01:58:29.152]  Right.
[01:58:29.432 --> 01:58:30.433]  You have to liquidate.
[01:58:30.933 --> 01:58:32.774]  Man, some of these people are just idiots.
[01:58:32.814 --> 01:58:35.995]  They spread lies just like they said Amazon doesn't pay any taxes.
[01:58:36.055 --> 01:58:37.956]  Come on now, they don't pay no taxes.
[01:58:39.096 --> 01:58:40.316]  Yeah, and people believe that.
[01:58:40.777 --> 01:58:42.777]  But people believe it because they don't know how to think for themselves.
[01:58:42.797 --> 01:58:43.958]  They just take them for the word.
[01:58:44.518 --> 01:58:47.719]  Well guys, I want to come back and get in the final segment.
[01:58:47.799 --> 01:58:49.980]  Again, I said this and then I diverted you, sorry.
[01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:51.461]  What do you think Trump should do?
[01:58:51.481 --> 01:58:52.821]  Because he listens to you guys.
[01:58:53.502 --> 01:58:55.902]  And I know we put pressure on him the last six months to get more hardcore.
[01:58:55.942 --> 01:58:56.283]  He did.
[01:58:56.323 --> 01:58:57.043]  He went up in the polls.
[01:58:58.063 --> 01:58:59.164]  Even though we know those polls are fake.
[01:58:59.804 --> 01:59:02.066]  The point is, what do you guys think President Trump should do?
[01:59:02.406 --> 01:59:03.386]  The Hodge Twins are here.
[01:59:03.446 --> 01:59:04.727]  Conservative Twins on YouTube.
[01:59:05.088 --> 01:59:06.749]  Instagram official Hodge Twins on Twitter.
[01:59:07.089 --> 01:59:08.410]  Hodge Twins, you want to follow them?
[01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:10.091]  You want to support them?
[01:59:10.531 --> 01:59:11.712]  I know I'm getting one of those t-shirts.
[01:59:11.752 --> 01:59:12.432]  Those are good looking.
[01:59:12.672 --> 01:59:13.193]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:13.213 --> 01:59:13.553]  Stay with us.
[01:59:13.793 --> 01:59:15.174]  You know what I love about the Hodge Twins?
[01:59:15.194 --> 01:59:16.155]  I've been watching them for years.
[01:59:17.142 --> 01:59:19.523]  Because they've got that positive Americana spirit.
[01:59:20.324 --> 01:59:21.224]  And they're not losers.
[01:59:21.244 --> 01:59:22.145]  They're not victims.
[01:59:22.705 --> 01:59:23.806]  They're not laying down.
[01:59:23.846 --> 01:59:26.348]  And I see the left so into being victims.
[01:59:26.388 --> 01:59:26.988]  So hateful.
[01:59:27.008 --> 01:59:28.269]  I feel sorry for them.
[01:59:28.949 --> 01:59:30.350]  Except they're so incredibly dangerous.
[01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:31.671]  I watch your show all the time.
[01:59:31.731 --> 01:59:32.151]  I watch it.
[01:59:32.171 --> 01:59:32.852]  It's in my feed.
[01:59:33.312 --> 01:59:34.733]  I watch you guys almost every day.
[01:59:35.515 --> 01:59:39.016]  And I know my son's a big fan, a lot of the career fans, but you're really polite on the show.
[01:59:39.036 --> 01:59:42.537]  You've done a great job, but you guys get going yourselves on your own show.
[01:59:42.557 --> 01:59:45.858]  So spend the next five minutes or so with what you think Trump ought to do.
[01:59:45.918 --> 01:59:47.018]  Anything else you want to say?
[01:59:47.298 --> 01:59:48.258]  You guys got the floor.
[01:59:49.439 --> 01:59:51.499]  I think he should just stay the course.
[01:59:51.899 --> 01:59:52.099]  Yeah.
[01:59:52.299 --> 01:59:54.920]  I mean, he's showing effective leadership.
[01:59:55.689 --> 01:59:57.911]  I know the mainstream media is turning him down every day.
[01:59:58.171 --> 01:59:59.552]  People on Twitter is turning him down.
[01:59:59.572 --> 02:00:05.496]  I mean, he's doing a great job, so he should just stay the course and just focus on this election, getting reelected.
[02:00:06.016 --> 02:00:10.199]  Once he gets reelected, I think we're going to all see the real Trump come out.
[02:00:10.739 --> 02:00:22.507]  I think all these riots that's been going on in Portland, all across America, BLM, and he's offered assistance to get these cities, you know, get these riots calmed down, get everybody safe.
[02:00:23.108 --> 02:00:23.768]  And they said,
[02:00:24.662 --> 02:00:27.503]  If he sends in the National Guard, he's inciting riots.
[02:00:27.583 --> 02:00:29.604]  I'm like, there's already riots.
[02:00:30.285 --> 02:00:31.965]  They're already burning down buildings.
[02:00:32.025 --> 02:00:33.186]  People's already been killed.
[02:00:33.586 --> 02:00:34.947]  Trump's inciting riots?
[02:00:35.207 --> 02:00:35.427]  Yeah.
[02:00:35.527 --> 02:00:39.729]  I think once he gets reelected, he'll be able to put his foot down.
[02:00:40.822 --> 02:00:43.885]  And take this country in the direction that he's already got it going in.
[02:00:43.985 --> 02:00:49.151]  Yeah, but by no mistake, by the imagination, Alex, this country is at a civil war.
[02:00:49.171 --> 02:00:49.932]  Nobody's saying it.
[02:00:50.032 --> 02:00:58.061]  You have these people on the left that are turning down monuments, burning down people's businesses, both white and black, killing both black and white people.
[02:00:58.581 --> 02:00:59.843]  And nobody's doing anything.
[02:00:59.883 --> 02:01:02.005]  And I think it's because the election's coming up.
[02:01:02.569 --> 02:01:07.872]  I mean, I think Trump doesn't want to, you know, actually, you know, do anything that could jeopardize him getting elected.
[02:01:07.972 --> 02:01:10.094]  I think this election is very, very important.
[02:01:10.114 --> 02:01:19.139]  But I do think once he's reelected, he needs to put his foot on the gas and get, uh, restore law and order in our inner cities, in these liberal ran neighborhoods.
[02:01:19.179 --> 02:01:19.400]  Yeah.
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:20.200]  Yeah.
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:23.002]  But, um, I mean, I think he's did a great job.
[02:01:23.869 --> 02:01:30.353]  I mean, nobody's perfect, but how he's handled the coronavirus and how he handles his State of the Union speeches, his rallies.
[02:01:30.794 --> 02:01:34.636]  I mean, the man has did a great job under the circumstances.
[02:01:34.676 --> 02:01:36.717]  I mean, put anybody else in his shoes.
[02:01:36.777 --> 02:01:40.220]  You think anybody else could have accomplished the things Trump has done?
[02:01:40.480 --> 02:01:44.642]  Yeah, it's like the whole time he's been in office, they've been attacking him.
[02:01:45.003 --> 02:01:45.183]  Yeah.
[02:01:45.443 --> 02:01:46.664]  I mean, with the impeachment.
[02:01:47.084 --> 02:01:51.187]  I mean, every week, every month, there's a new attack on him.
[02:01:51.427 --> 02:01:51.647]  Yeah.
[02:01:51.727 --> 02:01:53.128]  On Twitter, he's trending.
[02:01:53.743 --> 02:01:54.824]  Trump's hypocrisy.
[02:01:54.904 --> 02:01:56.764]  Trump's Nazi party.
[02:01:56.925 --> 02:01:58.385]  Trump lies, people die.
[02:01:58.545 --> 02:02:00.226]  I'm like, it's ridiculous.
[02:02:00.386 --> 02:02:09.791]  And it's, I find it very weird how you can blame one man for a virus that originated in another country.
[02:02:10.511 --> 02:02:11.351]  People forget that.
[02:02:11.391 --> 02:02:12.332]  That's a virus.
[02:02:12.412 --> 02:02:14.012]  Trump can't stop a virus.
[02:02:14.113 --> 02:02:17.194]  Yeah, people always say he is because of him so many people died.
[02:02:17.214 --> 02:02:21.456]  First of all, only 6% of the people that died from that virus
[02:02:22.333 --> 02:02:24.638]  Soul Cause was the virus.
[02:02:24.899 --> 02:02:25.160]  Right.
[02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:26.483]  That's right.
[02:02:26.503 --> 02:02:29.169]  60-70% of the deaths are people over the age of 60.
[02:02:30.225 --> 02:02:30.425]  Right.
[02:02:30.745 --> 02:02:33.167]  I mean, people like to point out how many people have died.
[02:02:33.347 --> 02:02:36.589]  What would you have done as a politician or a citizen?
[02:02:36.890 --> 02:02:38.090]  What would you have done different?
[02:02:38.130 --> 02:02:39.992]  He does the most balanced job he could.
[02:02:40.032 --> 02:02:43.674]  And since you mentioned that, former CIA officer, violence will explode if Trump wins.
[02:02:44.075 --> 02:02:52.921]  But he says it'll be, I agree, be even bigger if Biden wins because the left will try to see the country as weak and try to totally take over seeing Biden and Kamala Harris as weak.
[02:02:53.041 --> 02:02:56.403]  I mean, imagine if Trump loses what they're going to do.
[02:02:56.423 --> 02:02:57.664]  I think the left will go even more crazy.
[02:02:58.663 --> 02:02:59.704]  Yeah, man.
[02:02:59.884 --> 02:03:04.748]  Because the mayor of Portland, the mayor of Seattle support him, and then they come try to burn down their house?
[02:03:05.569 --> 02:03:06.430]  I mean, that's crazy.
[02:03:07.251 --> 02:03:09.313]  Big ass, the snake eating itself, Alex.
[02:03:09.553 --> 02:03:13.797]  They want to support, they want to, they want to call these people peaceful protesters.
[02:03:13.877 --> 02:03:15.818]  It's not peaceful when they show up at your house.
[02:03:15.879 --> 02:03:16.819]  It happened in Chicago.
[02:03:17.040 --> 02:03:17.300]  Yeah.
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:20.002]  The Chicago, uh, she, uh, mayor.
[02:03:20.022 --> 02:03:21.844]  She said, I deserve security.
[02:03:22.124 --> 02:03:23.786]  She said, I get security, but you don't.
[02:03:23.806 --> 02:03:24.006]  Yeah.
[02:03:24.912 --> 02:03:25.132]  Yeah.
[02:03:25.533 --> 02:03:27.015]  I get to have gun protection.
[02:03:27.055 --> 02:03:27.495]  You don't.
[02:03:27.776 --> 02:03:31.621]  Yeah, I mean, it's just like I said, the hypocrisy from the left.
[02:03:31.701 --> 02:03:37.528]  If you just sit and listen to both sides, I don't say anybody could be on the left, but they just go by what they hear.
[02:03:37.708 --> 02:03:38.329]  No, I agree.
[02:03:38.429 --> 02:03:40.332]  I think they're not self-aware.
[02:03:40.672 --> 02:03:41.812]  Because they didn't run their own business.
[02:03:41.832 --> 02:03:48.574]  When you run your own business, you're paying all the payroll, taxes, getting the lawn cut, doing the regulations, the electricity, something breaks.
[02:03:48.874 --> 02:03:53.455]  You gotta get lunch, you gotta pay the taxes, you gotta get the product in, you gotta kiss some people's ass.
[02:03:53.876 --> 02:03:57.296]  And these politicians, he's like, well I'm important, Lightfoot said.
[02:03:57.416 --> 02:03:58.697]  I get a haircut, you don't!
[02:03:59.577 --> 02:04:01.137]  She goes, I get bodyguards, you don't.
[02:04:01.198 --> 02:04:04.478]  It's like in Minnesota.
[02:04:05.119 --> 02:04:05.839]  What's the main city there?
[02:04:05.859 --> 02:04:06.319]  It's not St.
[02:04:06.359 --> 02:04:07.699]  Paul, it's Minneapolis.
[02:04:08.580 --> 02:04:13.701]  The mayor fires the policeman and goes, but I get private security a hundred thousand a day because I'm important.
[02:04:14.361 --> 02:04:19.023]  They say you don't get security in your house with a revolver, but he gets it.
[02:04:19.083 --> 02:04:22.624]  I mean, you couldn't write more hypocritical statements.
[02:04:23.584 --> 02:04:26.685]  Yeah, like when she went and got her hair done, she said, I need to get my hair done.
[02:04:26.725 --> 02:04:27.425]  I'm looking, I'm like,
[02:04:28.274 --> 02:04:29.215]  You got your hair done?
[02:04:29.275 --> 02:04:30.095]  You look a mess!
[02:04:30.376 --> 02:04:31.737]  It looks like you just begged for it.
[02:04:32.717 --> 02:04:46.007]  Yeah, and Nancy Pelosi, man, those poor barbers and salon owners, they've been shut down for so long and she has the audacity to go get her hair done while these people can't even support their families because of her actions.
[02:04:46.047 --> 02:04:50.191]  But that's what I'm saying is they're not even aware of... Why are they not self-aware?
[02:04:52.292 --> 02:04:53.433]  Intellectually weak, Alex.
[02:04:56.556 --> 02:04:58.037]  They don't know how to hold themselves accountable.
[02:04:58.077 --> 02:04:59.578]  They're not used to thinking for themselves.
[02:04:59.658 --> 02:05:12.344]  If you're being told what to do, if you're under the impression that the person that you elect is your mother and your father and you're just supposed to respect and do whatever they say, you can't think for yourself.
[02:05:12.404 --> 02:05:15.265]  You're going to go through your life behaving like a small child.
[02:05:15.305 --> 02:05:19.227]  Yeah, the left, the politicians just lie and hypocrisy.
[02:05:19.467 --> 02:05:20.588]  Hypocrisy is so much.
[02:05:21.068 --> 02:05:23.089]  They can't even remember what they said the week before.
[02:05:23.109 --> 02:05:24.529]  They're so deep in their own lives.
[02:05:24.549 --> 02:05:24.749]  Exactly.
[02:05:24.769 --> 02:05:25.369]  They contradict.
[02:05:25.389 --> 02:05:26.249]  You just said it.
[02:05:26.649 --> 02:05:29.450]  They contradict and they act like a small child their whole life.
[02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:30.590]  Yeah.
[02:05:30.910 --> 02:05:40.253]  And the thing about Trump, man, what I really love about him, he does not point the finger at anybody until he wants to make a comparison of what he's done compared to other administrations.
[02:05:40.553 --> 02:05:42.893]  You look at everybody on the left, it's always your fault.
[02:05:43.173 --> 02:05:49.635]  But when Trump explains things, he will only point the finger when he wants to make a comparison of what I've done and what the previous administration.
[02:05:50.356 --> 02:05:52.999]  He used it to give constructive criticism.
[02:05:53.259 --> 02:05:54.401]  Well, that's it.
[02:05:54.421 --> 02:05:55.962]  200 years of Democrat rule.
[02:05:56.283 --> 02:05:57.464]  How did that help black folks?
[02:05:57.885 --> 02:05:59.807]  And meanwhile, three years of Trump rule.
[02:05:59.867 --> 02:06:00.388]  How did it help?
[02:06:00.608 --> 02:06:01.850]  I mean, people can see the proof right there.
[02:06:02.965 --> 02:06:05.687]  Biden's been in politics for what, 40, 50 years?
[02:06:05.828 --> 02:06:07.729]  And now all of a sudden he's going to help black people.
[02:06:07.969 --> 02:06:09.751]  Now all of a sudden he's going to do prison reform.
[02:06:10.091 --> 02:06:12.173]  All of a sudden now he's going to do policing reform.
[02:06:12.413 --> 02:06:13.814]  You had 40 years to do this.
[02:06:14.014 --> 02:06:17.317]  You had a black man as your president and you didn't do anything.
[02:06:17.397 --> 02:06:18.738]  We don't need police reform.
[02:06:18.858 --> 02:06:21.941]  People should learn how to act around police officers.
[02:06:21.961 --> 02:06:24.142]  Remember how Obama wouldn't even visit black neighborhoods?
[02:06:24.182 --> 02:06:24.763]  Why was that?
[02:06:25.083 --> 02:06:25.844]  And then Trump does.
[02:06:28.186 --> 02:06:29.527]  Because he knows it's not safe.
[02:06:31.622 --> 02:06:32.903]  And he called over to them black people.
[02:06:34.003 --> 02:06:35.924]  Trump got balls now.
[02:06:36.064 --> 02:06:37.405]  Yeah, Trump, look what Trump did.
[02:06:37.425 --> 02:06:40.127]  He went to see Kim Jong-un, Rocket Man.
[02:06:40.267 --> 02:06:41.607]  No president's ever done that.
[02:06:41.688 --> 02:06:43.408]  President Trump is a real leader.
[02:06:43.609 --> 02:06:43.809]  Yeah.
[02:06:44.609 --> 02:06:45.249]  Point blank.
[02:06:45.329 --> 02:06:49.932]  I know the Secret Service, and they say Trump will go into, not that he's scared of black folks, but a big black church or anywhere.
[02:06:50.312 --> 02:06:52.113]  He says, don't harass, don't even really check everybody.
[02:06:52.373 --> 02:06:54.514]  Trump just goes in there, which makes me worry about him, actually.
[02:06:54.855 --> 02:06:56.816]  What happens, God forbid, if somebody kills him, though?
[02:06:56.836 --> 02:06:58.417]  Then you're talking about a real civil war.
[02:06:59.797 --> 02:07:00.298]  Oh, man.
[02:07:01.460 --> 02:07:02.461]  Nah, they don't want that.
[02:07:02.681 --> 02:07:04.722]  It's impossible to kill a president these days.
[02:07:05.022 --> 02:07:12.426]  As long as he's not rolling around on a convertible during a parade, he should be fine.
[02:07:12.486 --> 02:07:13.506]  Don't pull a JFK.
[02:07:13.986 --> 02:07:14.987]  Hey, I'm right here.
[02:07:15.007 --> 02:07:16.308]  Hey, you guys are kicking ass.
[02:07:16.368 --> 02:07:16.928]  We love you.
[02:07:17.008 --> 02:07:17.968]  We appreciate you.
[02:07:18.289 --> 02:07:20.090]  Hodge Twins, thank you for all you're doing.
[02:07:20.110 --> 02:07:20.930]  Everybody should visit you.
[02:07:20.950 --> 02:07:24.052]  They should visit your site and bookmark it in case you get censored on big platforms.
[02:07:24.412 --> 02:07:25.192]  And we love what you're doing.
[02:07:25.432 --> 02:07:25.712]  Thank you.
[02:07:25.732 --> 02:07:26.233]  God bless you.
[02:07:26.993 --> 02:07:27.593]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:07:27.793 --> 02:07:28.094]  Thank you.
[02:07:28.994 --> 02:07:31.777]  Man, those are our brothers in the fight to restore the Republic.
[02:07:31.797 --> 02:07:32.898]  We love them, the Hodge twins.
[02:07:33.338 --> 02:07:37.341]  They're not scared to come on here, which shows they're even more Americana than we can imagine.
[02:07:37.782 --> 02:07:40.684]  All right, I'm going to do a few segments, and then the next guest host is taking over.
[02:07:40.744 --> 02:07:42.406]  But I got some other news I need to hit.
[02:07:42.906 --> 02:07:44.027]  And I also need to pay some bills.
[02:07:44.407 --> 02:07:45.348]  And their T-shirts are awesome.
[02:07:45.388 --> 02:07:45.809]  I'm not lying.
[02:07:45.829 --> 02:07:46.469]  I'm actually jealous.
[02:07:47.070 --> 02:07:48.871]  We've got our new ones in, though, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:07:49.352 --> 02:07:50.513]  A listener sent me this design.
[02:07:50.533 --> 02:07:51.073]  I put it out.
[02:07:52.695 --> 02:07:53.155]  And it is.
[02:07:53.195 --> 02:07:54.516]  I got a bunch of new designs just came in.
[02:07:54.536 --> 02:07:54.937]  I'm just showing you.
[02:07:54.957 --> 02:07:55.957]  We actually have these in stock.
[02:07:56.755 --> 02:07:57.696]  Look at this baby right here.
[02:07:58.616 --> 02:08:00.398]  Arrest Fauci and Gates.
[02:08:01.279 --> 02:08:05.302]  And it's like Dayglo Blue with a yellow.
[02:08:06.022 --> 02:08:08.224]  And it says Mass Free Zone on the back.
[02:08:09.185 --> 02:08:09.825]  We've got that.
[02:08:11.106 --> 02:08:13.408]  And we've got this new shirt as well.
[02:08:14.329 --> 02:08:15.730]  People like something on the back of a shirt?
[02:08:16.170 --> 02:08:17.431]  This has got it on the back of the shirt.
[02:08:18.131 --> 02:08:20.313]  And it's got Don't Tread On Me on the back.
[02:08:20.814 --> 02:08:22.475]  And InfoWars Shield on the front.
[02:08:22.495 --> 02:08:26.158]  And then we've got all these other new shirts that have come in as well.
[02:08:27.415 --> 02:08:30.736]  They don't tread on me front and back with the navy blue, but let me tell you what I'm really proud of.
[02:08:31.356 --> 02:08:33.077]  And they're coming in Monday.
[02:08:33.277 --> 02:08:34.617]  They've been printed right here in Texas.
[02:08:35.157 --> 02:08:37.758]  And that is Joe Biden for nursing home.
[02:08:39.099 --> 02:08:41.239]  And obviously once he loses, we're not going to sell anymore.
[02:08:41.699 --> 02:08:43.420]  It's $17.76 plus free shipping.
[02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:46.501]  All apparel is $17.76 plus free shipping.
[02:08:47.441 --> 02:08:49.002]  We had the famous Hillary for prison shirt.
[02:08:49.022 --> 02:08:49.742]  Everybody imitated.
[02:08:49.762 --> 02:08:50.222]  That's great.
[02:08:50.262 --> 02:08:52.823]  Well, this is the Biden for nursing home shirt.
[02:08:54.025 --> 02:08:57.908]  The shirts come in Monday, they'll be shipped out to you, and then that's it.
[02:08:58.429 --> 02:08:59.670]  We're only going to do a limited run of these.
[02:08:59.690 --> 02:09:01.211]  We're not going to sell these after the election, obviously.
[02:09:03.473 --> 02:09:05.714]  Especially if Biden wins, I think I'm going to go jump off a cliff.
[02:09:07.556 --> 02:09:08.497]  That's hypothetical, folks.
[02:09:08.557 --> 02:09:09.037]  I'm joking.
[02:09:09.057 --> 02:09:09.978]  I'm not going to jump off any cliffs.
[02:09:10.418 --> 02:09:11.459]  I will never commit suicide.
[02:09:12.120 --> 02:09:14.221]  All right, fourth hour, straight ahead.
[02:09:14.662 --> 02:09:16.283]  Fourth hour, straight ahead.
[02:09:16.703 --> 02:09:18.565]  I'll finish up, and then Nick Begich.
[02:09:20.572 --> 02:09:23.953]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[02:09:23.973 --> 02:09:25.133]  They're going to contest the election.
[02:09:25.153 --> 02:09:26.713]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[02:09:26.873 --> 02:09:28.254]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[02:09:28.354 --> 02:09:29.374]  I want them shut down.
[02:09:29.454 --> 02:09:30.354]  I want them silenced.
[02:09:30.414 --> 02:09:31.195]  I want them muted.
[02:09:31.235 --> 02:09:33.015]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:09:33.055 --> 02:09:33.995]  You kept us on air.
[02:09:34.115 --> 02:09:35.396]  We did the analysis first.
[02:09:35.676 --> 02:09:36.696]  It's now gone mainstream.
[02:09:36.736 --> 02:09:38.556]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[02:09:38.836 --> 02:09:44.738]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[02:09:44.938 --> 02:09:46.398]  And you need to stop right now.
[02:09:46.478 --> 02:09:47.538]  And they're very, very serious.
[02:09:47.698 --> 02:09:50.179]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[02:09:50.179 --> 02:09:50.979]  This is not going to happen.
[02:09:50.999 --> 02:09:52.900]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[02:09:53.360 --> 02:09:54.480]  I used to say support InfoWars.
[02:09:54.920 --> 02:09:55.841]  Rescue InfoWars.
[02:09:55.901 --> 02:09:56.541]  Save yourself.
[02:09:56.901 --> 02:09:57.541]  Save the world.
[02:09:57.861 --> 02:09:58.721]  We're in this together.
[02:09:58.841 --> 02:10:00.462]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:10:00.482 --> 02:10:01.462]  Communism's up here.
[02:10:01.682 --> 02:10:04.623]  InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[02:10:05.023 --> 02:10:06.844]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[02:10:07.044 --> 02:10:08.584]  My children are right here!
[02:10:09.324 --> 02:10:11.065]  But I need money to fight a war!
[02:10:11.265 --> 02:10:12.325]  And I need word of mouth!
[02:10:12.525 --> 02:10:13.425]  And I need prayer!
[02:10:13.585 --> 02:10:14.526]  And I need action!
[02:10:14.726 --> 02:10:16.506]  Because that dam's going to come down!
[02:10:17.226 --> 02:10:18.087]  Trump's told you!
[02:10:18.347 --> 02:10:19.167]  Hell's coming!
[02:10:19.810 --> 02:10:20.871]  We are back live.
[02:10:20.951 --> 02:10:22.913]  We are broadcasting worldwide.
[02:10:23.073 --> 02:10:27.777]  Loved, loved, loved having the Hodge twins on for this last hour.
[02:10:29.278 --> 02:10:31.280]  Okay, Dr. Dick Meggers is taking over in about 10 minutes.
[02:10:31.941 --> 02:10:34.403]  I've got a few final things I want to hit.
[02:10:34.423 --> 02:10:35.544]  I didn't really get to this.
[02:10:36.705 --> 02:10:43.431]  They had over 6,000 boats on Lake Travis outside Austin last Saturday, and I was already set to do a live show here.
[02:10:43.471 --> 02:10:46.333]  I didn't go out there, but I saw how crazy it was.
[02:10:47.614 --> 02:10:51.018]  I guarantee you there's going to be aftershocks of that baby tomorrow.
[02:10:51.258 --> 02:10:53.220]  I bet there's a thousand boats out there, that's what I'm guessing.
[02:10:54.081 --> 02:10:56.183]  So I'll be out there about noon to whenever.
[02:10:57.064 --> 02:11:04.733]  I'll do a live feed into the InfoWars.com forward slash show and we will break it all down for you because it's good to go out and celebrate.
[02:11:05.413 --> 02:11:06.835]  It's good to go out and have a good time.
[02:11:06.855 --> 02:11:08.116]  You know, I see the Hodge twins.
[02:11:09.008 --> 02:11:12.831]  Who I know behind the scenes and on air just always are in a good mood and positive.
[02:11:13.491 --> 02:11:14.632]  And that's how I want to be.
[02:11:15.072 --> 02:11:20.116]  Cheerful about this, positive, moving forward, even if Trump loses, which I don't think is going to happen.
[02:11:20.636 --> 02:11:21.557]  We just keep fighting.
[02:11:22.778 --> 02:11:24.939]  You know, the Hodge twins are my spirit animal, I think.
[02:11:25.780 --> 02:11:30.403]  And I hope to be their spirit animal, but we were all each other's inspirations, what I'm getting at here.
[02:11:33.055 --> 02:11:40.780]  I get down, folks, and I don't get suicidal, but when I read these type of articles, this is what I want to hit right now, I never get suicidal.
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:43.883]  I never want to die, but I actually feel weak.
[02:11:45.143 --> 02:11:46.444]  Like, I don't have enough energy.
[02:11:46.464 --> 02:11:53.909]  Sometimes I'm up here at 6, 7 at night, and there's a huge breaking story, and I know it's important to fight, and I want to fight, and the spirit's willing, but the flesh is weak.
[02:11:56.091 --> 02:11:58.533]  And I just kind of go, God, I love you so much.
[02:12:00.367 --> 02:12:03.608]  I kind of know what it's like when my grandma at 90 years old said, I'm not worried about dying.
[02:12:04.228 --> 02:12:05.529]  And it's not that I even want to die.
[02:12:06.249 --> 02:12:11.771]  It's just that I know the purity of Christ and not being on this satanic plane must be amazing.
[02:12:12.591 --> 02:12:14.412]  But see, here's why you shouldn't commit suicide.
[02:12:14.432 --> 02:12:15.893]  And I'm not saying I would, I don't want to.
[02:12:16.713 --> 02:12:19.674]  I'm not even in that same realm, but I can understand why folks are like that.
[02:12:20.214 --> 02:12:21.315]  Because you want to punch out of here.
[02:12:21.335 --> 02:12:21.915]  You want to get away from it.
[02:12:21.935 --> 02:12:23.716]  But listen, you're a grown man.
[02:12:23.756 --> 02:12:24.656]  You're a grown woman.
[02:12:24.716 --> 02:12:25.776]  You know what's going on.
[02:12:25.876 --> 02:12:27.257]  You have a responsibility.
[02:12:28.683 --> 02:12:32.887]  To help innocents that aren't adults, that don't know what's going on, to protect them.
[02:12:33.748 --> 02:12:38.853]  And so quit worrying about how upset you are about what's happening, and start worrying about other people.
[02:12:40.394 --> 02:12:43.037]  And it's going to be that process of worrying about other people.
[02:12:43.097 --> 02:12:46.240]  Or maybe it's a couple plants you get that you take care of in your backyard.
[02:12:47.221 --> 02:12:48.582]  Or a dog or a cat you take care of.
[02:12:48.602 --> 02:12:50.964]  That's why people that have dogs and cats don't commit suicide as much.
[02:12:51.465 --> 02:12:53.667]  Because you've got something that's dependent on you.
[02:12:55.066 --> 02:12:57.268]  And so, I'm not up here preaching to people.
[02:12:57.508 --> 02:13:00.111]  I mean, I get why people want to punch out.
[02:13:02.013 --> 02:13:04.074]  At my level, not commit suicide, but just leave.
[02:13:04.595 --> 02:13:05.416]  Not do this anymore.
[02:13:05.516 --> 02:13:07.598]  Not stare into the face of evil.
[02:13:07.618 --> 02:13:09.239]  I mean, let me tell you something.
[02:13:09.780 --> 02:13:10.761]  Let me try to quantify this.
[02:13:12.782 --> 02:13:22.227]  Every morning I wake up at like 4 or 5 in the morning and I go, I don't want to think about Hillary Clinton, or Barack Obama, or Big Mike, or General Mattis, or Lord Rothschild.
[02:13:22.327 --> 02:13:26.970]  I mean, they're all are, Brena Bronovich, or Tony Podesta.
[02:13:28.131 --> 02:13:40.217]  I mean, but it's like, it's like, like I spend my life looking at them, and looking at Netflix pedophile stuff, and you know, at a certain point I'm like, God, take me out of this, you know what I mean?
[02:13:40.238 --> 02:13:40.798]  But you know what?
[02:13:42.967 --> 02:13:46.234]  Those of us that care and have a conscience can see this and don't like it for a reason.
[02:13:47.577 --> 02:13:49.901]  And it's our job to stand up against it and say no to it.
[02:13:51.550 --> 02:13:53.931]  And so that's all I'm getting at is, I'm not here bitching at you.
[02:13:54.331 --> 02:13:55.711]  I'm not here saying you need to do more.
[02:13:55.831 --> 02:14:00.172]  Believe me, I want to load up in an RV and disappear.
[02:14:00.612 --> 02:14:03.653]  I mean, if there was some new country that was halfway free, I'd be gone so fast.
[02:14:04.253 --> 02:14:07.654]  This is a world government AI New World Order takeover.
[02:14:08.294 --> 02:14:09.594]  And we're not getting out of this.
[02:14:09.754 --> 02:14:13.115]  And I'll tell you right now, I happen to know the man upstairs.
[02:14:13.155 --> 02:14:18.697]  I know you all know him a little bit as well, or maybe more than I do, but I happen to have a little bit of a connection.
[02:14:22.150 --> 02:14:26.011]  You don't want to stand in front of God and not have fought the full fight.
[02:14:26.771 --> 02:14:28.192]  But I tell you, I'm a human.
[02:14:28.972 --> 02:14:34.213]  I tell you how I falter because I don't want you to think that you're weak because you don't want to fight these people.
[02:14:34.773 --> 02:14:35.193]  And I get it.
[02:14:35.213 --> 02:14:37.214]  It's not that you don't want to fight them because you're scared.
[02:14:37.574 --> 02:14:38.994]  They're so damn gross, man.
[02:14:39.494 --> 02:14:40.695]  They stink spiritually.
[02:14:40.715 --> 02:14:42.055]  They're disgusting people.
[02:14:42.995 --> 02:14:48.177]  And I know you don't want to focus on beautiful things and you want to focus on pure things.
[02:14:48.217 --> 02:14:48.897]  But listen, here's the thing.
[02:14:50.014 --> 02:14:53.535]  The pure thing is under attack because you're not fighting the evil thing.
[02:14:55.696 --> 02:15:01.017]  So pull your metaphysical sword of truth and start hacking.
[02:15:03.178 --> 02:15:03.558]  All right.
[02:15:03.958 --> 02:15:06.599]  If I could do this once a day, I'd do it.
[02:15:06.839 --> 02:15:09.800]  But if I don't do it, every couple of segments will be shut down.
[02:15:09.880 --> 02:15:11.000]  So I appreciate all the listeners.
[02:15:11.560 --> 02:15:12.601]  I appreciate all the viewers.
[02:15:13.881 --> 02:15:16.842]  And I'm about to hand the baton over to Dr. Nick Begich, but I'll just explain it this way.
[02:15:18.537 --> 02:15:20.298]  I do not treat my body well.
[02:15:20.378 --> 02:15:21.818]  I love to eat tons of red meat.
[02:15:21.998 --> 02:15:23.739]  I live a super stressful life.
[02:15:24.859 --> 02:15:28.601]  I work 15-16 hours a day, and I play hard sometimes as well.
[02:15:29.401 --> 02:15:35.143]  And so I tell you, take the supplements we sell, because they're the very best out there, but I routinely forget to take my supplements for months.
[02:15:36.544 --> 02:15:40.305]  I'll get on them, have the little Lazy Susan on the table,
[02:15:41.903 --> 02:15:47.145]  I'll have them right here in my studio and then they'll clean it off and for two months I won't take it and I'll gain 15 pounds.
[02:15:47.785 --> 02:15:54.428]  That's how important clean pure iodine is with X2 or X3 or DNA Force Plus or these other products.
[02:15:55.469 --> 02:16:03.192]  And so, they really are great products but even if they were placebo, even if they were sugar, which they're not, they're highest end you're going to get.
[02:16:04.369 --> 02:16:06.472]  They do fund this operation, which is really, really special.
[02:16:06.512 --> 02:16:12.458]  So, the books, the films, the water filtration, the high-quality, storable food, it's all at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:16:14.847 --> 02:16:19.191]  I've been asked by some smart folks and strategic people not to get into what's going on here.
[02:16:19.271 --> 02:16:23.695]  But, I mean, I think you know for the last five days we've been under Chinese hack attack.
[02:16:24.956 --> 02:16:27.539]  And I have a lot of trouble holding things back from the audience.
[02:16:27.599 --> 02:16:31.162]  But then when I talk about it, the enemy uses it, it becomes an issue.
[02:16:31.202 --> 02:16:37.948]  But you've seen how they've been deplatforming people, not just off the internet, but how they've been deplatforming people out of banking and credit cards.
[02:16:38.769 --> 02:16:57.559]  So I'm spending a good five hours a day jacking around with that and like I'm kind of a whack-a-mole but let me just say it's it's it's ten times the attacks we ever dealt with before and at kind of a sick level I'm like well they just shut me down I gotta lay everybody off but I can at least take a break but I don't want to take a break but Barnaby does like God Almighty take a break.
[02:16:58.219 --> 02:17:02.681]  All I'm getting at here is is this is really in-game stuff happening and um
[02:17:06.621 --> 02:17:09.926]  You know, Trump's basically bankrupt because of this.
[02:17:10.286 --> 02:17:12.669]  They've attacked all his companies, all his things, and that's fine.
[02:17:13.010 --> 02:17:13.791]  We're not victims.
[02:17:13.831 --> 02:17:18.798]  We don't approach things as victims, but as champions and leaders in this fight.
[02:17:18.838 --> 02:17:20.560]  But I mean, it's not been fun.
[02:17:21.553 --> 02:17:24.155]  And so, I've already mortgaged my house.
[02:17:24.615 --> 02:17:28.237]  I've already done it all to make sure we have just a month operating capital.
[02:17:28.257 --> 02:17:30.398]  I have pressed on everything I've done.
[02:17:30.418 --> 02:17:37.502]  I have funded 50-plus organizations over the years, covertly, with no strings attached, because I thought they were good people.
[02:17:37.522 --> 02:17:38.303]  In many cases, they were.
[02:17:38.323 --> 02:17:39.423]  In some cases, they weren't.
[02:17:39.443 --> 02:17:43.066]  I'm just saying you cannot bet in the crap game of life
[02:17:43.866 --> 02:17:49.050]  Or the roulette wheel of life on a number like 1776 that Info Wars metaphysically represents.
[02:17:49.090 --> 02:17:51.012]  So I want to thank you all for your prayers.
[02:17:51.372 --> 02:18:03.822]  Your word of mouth is just as important, but I just I'd be a liar if I didn't tell you that if we were like a battleship where we got fire shooting out the side and you know cannonballs, you know exploding and all nine yards, which is fine.
[02:18:04.282 --> 02:18:08.946]  I always expected this but 52 days out the deep state their whole system.
[02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:16.724]  I mean, you know what happened to like Romans where they'd take somebody's kid hostage and stuff like that.
[02:18:16.784 --> 02:18:19.866]  I mean, let me just explain something to you.
[02:18:21.167 --> 02:18:22.929]  Someday I'll be able to tell you all the stuff that's going on.
[02:18:23.249 --> 02:18:24.570]  And I don't feel sorry for myself.
[02:18:25.391 --> 02:18:29.334]  I just want you to know, to me, I'm a gauge, like a canary in the coal mine.
[02:18:29.834 --> 02:18:32.316]  And so attacks before were like, you know, 50%.
[02:18:32.356 --> 02:18:33.297]  They're at 100% right now.
[02:18:35.431 --> 02:18:37.672]  The thermometer might break at the top.
[02:18:37.932 --> 02:18:39.973]  You know, Dr. Nick Begich, he's not a victim, he's an overcomer.
[02:18:40.213 --> 02:18:44.435]  They killed his dad for giving Native Americans and citizens of Alaska part of their own land.
[02:18:45.016 --> 02:18:48.937]  So, I mean, a lot of people paid for what we've got, and I'm ready to pay right now.
[02:18:50.538 --> 02:18:51.298]  I'm not even worried about it.
[02:18:51.678 --> 02:18:53.639]  I'm worried about myself and God and the rest of eternity.
[02:18:53.679 --> 02:18:59.021]  And you know, like Begich always says, people would give everything for that last five minutes of life until you're gone.
[02:18:59.061 --> 02:18:59.841]  It doesn't matter anymore.
[02:19:00.061 --> 02:19:02.102]  You've got eternity and now time is worthless.
[02:19:02.622 --> 02:19:04.763]  So I already get that Zen understanding.
[02:19:05.343 --> 02:19:10.145]  But I'm just telling you, I need to tell you as a gauge in a dashboard that
[02:19:11.005 --> 02:19:12.786]  That this is the big one, folks.
[02:19:13.206 --> 02:19:14.587]  This is the big enchilada.
[02:19:15.067 --> 02:19:21.550]  The way we break these balls right now, at the beginning of this pool game, is going to affect the whole next level.
[02:19:22.110 --> 02:19:28.833]  And so, your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support, I would engage in it now, because it could be your last chance to get an InfoWars t-shirt.
[02:19:28.853 --> 02:19:37.617]  It could be your last chance to support us into the future, because I'm somebody that has been very close to destruction a lot of times, but we've never been this close.
[02:19:38.297 --> 02:19:42.064]  Uh, and so I do need to go ahead and just tell you that, uh, you know, we're, we're under attack.
[02:19:42.084 --> 02:19:43.366]  We're, we're SOS.
[02:19:43.487 --> 02:19:46.812]  We're, we're on fire in more ways than one spiritually.
[02:19:46.832 --> 02:19:47.353]  We're on fire.
[02:19:47.373 --> 02:19:50.559]  We're also on fire under enemy attack because we are in the fight.
[02:19:51.100 --> 02:19:51.240]  So.
[02:19:52.489 --> 02:19:53.369]  That's my transmission.
[02:19:53.389 --> 02:19:54.790]  I want to thank you all.
[02:19:54.810 --> 02:20:00.392]  We'll have live coverage tomorrow of the next Trump boat rally, and I'll be back Sunday, Lord willing, with a Sunday show, 4 to 6 p.m.
[02:20:00.412 --> 02:20:02.093]  We now have Sunday live with Owen Schroer as well.
[02:20:02.473 --> 02:20:07.035]  Dr. Nick Begich, scientist, researcher, best-selling author, great patriot, takes over.
[02:20:07.395 --> 02:20:08.556]  So thank you, Dr. Nick Begich.
[02:20:11.355 --> 02:20:19.001]  I want to pick up right where you left off, you know, because I think back how long we've been working together.
[02:20:19.041 --> 02:20:25.146]  And then about two and a half years ago, the first time we actually met in person, you know, I flew down to Austin.
[02:20:25.226 --> 02:20:25.886]  It was amazing.
[02:20:25.926 --> 02:20:26.427]  Yeah.
[02:20:27.347 --> 02:20:27.848]  Yeah.
[02:20:27.968 --> 02:20:32.852]  And I spent a week with everybody and got to meet your team and who's there.
[02:20:33.192 --> 02:20:34.233]  And, you know, and
[02:20:35.017 --> 02:20:39.139]  Just before then and since then, every Friday, I volunteer my time.
[02:20:39.239 --> 02:20:45.501]  So, you know, what Alex is saying right now, I can tell you, is the absolute truth.
[02:20:45.561 --> 02:20:52.223]  And I remember that day, that night at dinner, we're having dinner and we're talking, and Alex is always running 110%.
[02:20:52.464 --> 02:20:59.306]  And at one point in dinner, he goes, hey, break out the camera, we're gonna film it.
[02:20:59.386 --> 02:21:01.387]  And I said, Alex, Alex, relax, you know?
[02:21:01.952 --> 02:21:03.895]  Because you're always working.
[02:21:04.175 --> 02:21:08.541]  And this is what the audience and people listening need to understand.
[02:21:08.641 --> 02:21:12.767]  It's not like, oh, the day's over, the light switches off.
[02:21:12.907 --> 02:21:13.708]  It never ends.
[02:21:14.629 --> 02:21:15.270]  It never ends.
[02:21:15.310 --> 02:21:17.172]  He's doing like 110 percent.
[02:21:18.013 --> 02:21:19.015]  And then what happens?
[02:21:19.725 --> 02:21:22.166]  You know, you're always running that speed.
[02:21:22.246 --> 02:21:25.828]  And at some point you need a little bit of a break and you never and you never get.
[02:21:25.868 --> 02:21:27.329]  I know exactly what you're saying.
[02:21:27.730 --> 02:21:31.091]  And at the end of the dinner, I remember we were walking out of the restaurant.
[02:21:31.171 --> 02:21:33.113]  I put my hand in the center of your chest.
[02:21:33.193 --> 02:21:36.314]  I said, Alex, you don't need to run one hundred and ten percent.
[02:21:36.334 --> 02:21:36.875]  You need to run 90.
[02:21:37.755 --> 02:21:39.116]  So you've got 10 percent
[02:21:41.577 --> 02:21:48.506]  Have that reserve, you know, and dish it out to your family and your close friends and reserve that for you.
[02:21:48.526 --> 02:21:53.111]  And it's like you're diving to your own temple, you know, if you think about it that way.
[02:21:53.632 --> 02:21:59.479]  And you add about 10 years on to your life on the other end, you know, you live longer because you're less stressed.
[02:21:59.919 --> 02:22:15.928]  But the audience right now needs to support the InfoWars and do something affirmative that is material because that's the way that the green gasoline that keeps the thing going and the way it's done is the 360.
[02:22:16.808 --> 02:22:18.429]  And that's where everybody wins.
[02:22:18.889 --> 02:22:20.370]  So support the InfoWars.
[02:22:20.410 --> 02:22:21.691]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[02:22:22.411 --> 02:22:27.354]  Get something there that means something to you and can help you and your family.
[02:22:28.018 --> 02:22:29.099]  And do that today.
[02:22:29.399 --> 02:22:31.441]  So when it makes a difference to the InfoWars.
[02:22:31.481 --> 02:22:31.801]  Today!
[02:22:32.461 --> 02:22:34.102]  And I volunteer every Friday.
[02:22:34.142 --> 02:22:37.545]  I take my morning out and I get ready for the program and I do that.
[02:22:37.785 --> 02:22:46.631]  And I do that because two and a half years ago, I said, Alex, I don't want all the noise, you know, the transaction noise of selling books and selling products.
[02:22:46.691 --> 02:22:47.952]  I just want to give content.
[02:22:47.972 --> 02:22:50.234]  I want to give something once a week.
[02:22:50.534 --> 02:22:52.235]  And would you please allow me to do that?
[02:22:52.355 --> 02:22:54.237]  And we've worked this out where I get to do that.
[02:22:54.867 --> 02:22:59.673]  And yeah, I still have some books and some videos, but they're only sold through the InfoWars store.
[02:23:00.053 --> 02:23:00.574]  That's it.
[02:23:00.634 --> 02:23:02.816]  The only place you can get them and those are you.
[02:23:03.357 --> 02:23:08.603]  And because I want to support this network, what it stands for, what it's done for a quarter of a century.
[02:23:09.044 --> 02:23:11.907]  It's been about the InfoWars for goodness sake.
[02:23:11.947 --> 02:23:13.449]  That's all it's ever been about.
[02:23:14.822 --> 02:23:26.097]  If you don't think it's about that now, you've not been paying attention to anything anybody's been saying for at least 25 years plus I've been doing that.
[02:23:27.054 --> 02:23:29.356]  Quarter of a century Alex has been doing this.
[02:23:30.316 --> 02:23:35.720]  And the team that's on board in Austin, your team, is incredible.
[02:23:35.980 --> 02:23:45.026]  Everybody there, what they do, and the stress levels that happen up and down, you know, as you're trying to get the story out and you're trying to get the information.
[02:23:46.047 --> 02:23:49.429]  And so, do something affirmative.
[02:23:49.730 --> 02:23:54.633]  Last week I talked about what you can do, you know, and kind of a script that can be followed.
[02:23:55.519 --> 02:23:59.562]  Do something in favor of yourself, your family, your friends.
[02:24:00.403 --> 02:24:05.406]  Extend to the Infowars family, too, and make something happen.
[02:24:06.007 --> 02:24:06.968]  And that's how we do it.
[02:24:07.088 --> 02:24:08.148]  We do it together.
[02:24:08.409 --> 02:24:10.250]  We're all that tip of that spear.
[02:24:10.270 --> 02:24:16.895]  We're all making a difference in everything that we do, no matter how big or how small we think it is.
[02:24:17.375 --> 02:24:18.396]  And I've said it often.
[02:24:19.252 --> 02:24:20.813]  Do what you know you can do.
[02:24:20.873 --> 02:24:25.395]  That's the step of faith in life, whether it's supporting this network or something else.
[02:24:25.895 --> 02:24:33.718]  Do something in favor of your own future and the future of those you haven't even met yet, the unborn, those that haven't even arrived yet.
[02:24:34.299 --> 02:24:35.179]  Do something for them.
[02:24:35.539 --> 02:24:36.660]  This is Dr. Nick Begich.
[02:24:36.700 --> 02:24:37.380]  We'll be right back.
[02:24:39.469 --> 02:24:45.333]  And welcome back, and it's good to be here this Friday afternoon in most parts of the country.
[02:24:45.393 --> 02:24:48.896]  Still a little before noon here in Anchorage, Alaska.
[02:24:48.936 --> 02:24:49.176]  You know,
[02:24:50.282 --> 02:25:10.258]  I'm thinking about just everything that's going on, and I know it's the anniversary of 9-11, and people have been talking about that already today, and I'm not going to go there at the moment, except to say that, you know, big opportunities are buried in bad news, you know, no matter what the heck.
[02:25:10.838 --> 02:25:11.278]  It is.
[02:25:11.439 --> 02:25:18.283]  And when you got to think about this, what did 9 11 roll out or roll out the endless war?
[02:25:18.323 --> 02:25:23.386]  You know, like we dropped back a few centuries into these 30 year, 100 year wars.
[02:25:23.426 --> 02:25:26.048]  You know, Alex was a history buff.
[02:25:26.108 --> 02:25:30.411]  My dad was a history teacher as a beginning point.
[02:25:30.531 --> 02:25:33.973]  You know, in history is really defines a lot.
[02:25:34.033 --> 02:25:34.974]  In fact, I was
[02:25:35.948 --> 02:25:37.749]  I was talking about this book.
[02:25:37.930 --> 02:25:42.413]  It's the New American History by Woodard and W.E.
[02:25:42.473 --> 02:25:42.813]  Woodard.
[02:25:42.893 --> 02:25:49.738]  And this book, I ordered another copy because they're kind of hard to find because they printed the last ones in 1939, excuse me, 37.
[02:25:49.818 --> 02:25:51.860]  And so they're a little difficult to find.
[02:25:56.087 --> 02:26:02.451]  It's worth reading, because it was pre-World War II, you know, after World War I, pre-World War II.
[02:26:02.491 --> 02:26:11.916]  The guy who wrote it, interesting, he finished it just before 1936, and so his perspective was really a different one.
[02:26:11.956 --> 02:26:24.484]  That's before the internet, you know, that's before most people had telephones, that's before TV, that's before where people listened to the radio, you know, that was, you know, radio was it, you know, that was a big entertainment.
[02:26:25.425 --> 02:26:33.991]  And so, when you think about history, people used to read, you know, read books that you can't change after the fact, like you can a story on the internet, right?
[02:26:34.391 --> 02:26:39.955]  Wikipedia, you can pull it out, push it in, dance it around, make it up.
[02:26:40.636 --> 02:26:41.597]  Who cares, right?
[02:26:41.657 --> 02:26:42.838]  I mean, that's history today.
[02:26:43.558 --> 02:26:44.619]  Obsolete books.
[02:26:45.159 --> 02:26:46.200]  Get yourself some.
[02:26:46.340 --> 02:26:48.282]  Those are really not especially history.
[02:26:48.302 --> 02:26:49.883]  History's never obsolete.
[02:26:50.879 --> 02:27:01.122]  In fact, the perspective of a writer closer to the time might actually be more useful, if you can interpret it in the context in which it was written.
[02:27:01.962 --> 02:27:07.943]  You know, that's why, you know, being a bit of a scholar, you know, you think about things differently.
[02:27:08.003 --> 02:27:17.766]  And I got, you know, I suffered through a bunch of things, you know, and Alex has built a big organization with a lot of risk, and he's suffering through some things from time to time.
[02:27:18.786 --> 02:27:21.408]  You know, at one point in my public work, I lost everything.
[02:27:21.468 --> 02:27:22.869]  I had a bankrupt start over.
[02:27:22.909 --> 02:27:24.430]  That's 2002.
[02:27:25.091 --> 02:27:30.194]  Most people didn't know it, you know, because I started this work way before that, and I just kept on going.
[02:27:30.654 --> 02:27:33.596]  You know, I sort of hit a big speed bump.
[02:27:33.656 --> 02:27:34.457]  And so what did I do?
[02:27:34.837 --> 02:27:39.600]  I set up another way to make my living while I was continuing my public work, and I never stopped.
[02:27:40.521 --> 02:27:44.444]  And then I got blessed by some good things happening in my life.
[02:27:45.550 --> 02:27:45.790]  I think so.
[02:28:02.757 --> 02:28:04.198]  What's in it for them, right?
[02:28:04.438 --> 02:28:05.939]  And this is an important perspective.
[02:28:05.979 --> 02:28:09.141]  I've known a lot of very wealthy people, billionaires, in fact.
[02:28:09.201 --> 02:28:12.402]  I've known a bunch of very powerful political people.
[02:28:12.442 --> 02:28:20.747]  I've met presidents and vice presidents and congressmen and senators and scads of people in power, big business leaders that own big chunks of the economy.
[02:28:21.445 --> 02:28:26.928]  I've met a lot of people in my life because of the nature of what I've done in my life.
[02:28:27.328 --> 02:28:29.870]  And so and then I read all the time.
[02:28:29.930 --> 02:28:33.932]  My fiancee will tell you, I read like eight, nine hours a day.
[02:28:33.992 --> 02:28:34.753]  That's what I do.
[02:28:34.813 --> 02:28:36.494]  That's my profession, actually.
[02:28:37.234 --> 02:28:40.075]  To do that, condense information and pass it on to you.
[02:28:40.575 --> 02:28:47.297]  And then I make my living with my left foot, as one of my buddies used to say, and I'm very blessed in that because I get to do this.
[02:28:47.918 --> 02:28:50.158]  And here's what I learned about wealth.
[02:28:50.258 --> 02:28:57.801]  Wealth is about doing what you love doing, you know, and so you want to interpret people, interpret what motivates them.
[02:28:58.436 --> 02:29:00.378]  You know, and here's what motivates me.
[02:29:01.018 --> 02:29:02.239]  It's motivating you.
[02:29:02.259 --> 02:29:03.680]  That's it.
[02:29:03.780 --> 02:29:06.002]  You know, because I never organized the thing.
[02:29:06.042 --> 02:29:07.423]  You know, I don't have a big team.
[02:29:07.603 --> 02:29:08.484]  I don't have a team.
[02:29:08.624 --> 02:29:14.049]  I have you and the people that work in InfoWars and the other networks that I work with.
[02:29:14.229 --> 02:29:15.210]  That is my team.
[02:29:15.470 --> 02:29:17.772]  I always set it up that way.
[02:29:17.792 --> 02:29:17.852]  Why?
[02:29:18.512 --> 02:29:25.858]  Because I wanted to develop content and still reserve something so that I could keep being creative.
[02:29:26.158 --> 02:29:28.000]  Because this is what a lot of us miss.
[02:29:29.642 --> 02:29:35.646]  It's the creative things we do with our most valuable thing we have called time.
[02:29:36.607 --> 02:29:41.631]  In the physical, that is the definition of living well.
[02:29:41.811 --> 02:29:48.356]  With a living soul occupying a body is the time slot that you get while you're here.
[02:29:49.317 --> 02:29:54.581]  Okay, so what I've been talking about a lot lately is not wasting your time slot.
[02:29:55.189 --> 02:29:57.630]  And not feeling frustrated because you're not running at 110%.
[02:29:57.670 --> 02:30:00.951]  You don't need to do that.
[02:30:01.171 --> 02:30:01.831]  You need to run 90%.
[02:30:02.812 --> 02:30:04.372]  That's an A, right?
[02:30:04.632 --> 02:30:06.193]  It's an A. Good.
[02:30:06.773 --> 02:30:08.954]  Reserve 10% to your own temple.
[02:30:09.434 --> 02:30:10.234]  Your body.
[02:30:11.355 --> 02:30:12.175]  Your body.
[02:30:13.118 --> 02:30:14.600]  And be respectful of that.
[02:30:14.760 --> 02:30:30.915]  And then your body and the extension of it through your spouse, all right, and your family and your friends, your extension in the earth of this thing that we're engaged in, you have it for them and for you.
[02:30:31.656 --> 02:30:32.557]  And that's okay.
[02:30:33.138 --> 02:30:33.758]  It really is.
[02:30:34.279 --> 02:30:35.140]  And here's the deal.
[02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:37.222]  Then you're then you're optimized.
[02:30:38.010 --> 02:30:39.671]  Then you're balanced and optimized.
[02:30:39.731 --> 02:30:40.671]  That's part of the deal.
[02:30:41.431 --> 02:30:45.512]  And you can go and weather the storm because you're the middle of the storm.
[02:30:46.153 --> 02:30:47.733]  You're the quiet part of the storm.
[02:30:48.333 --> 02:30:49.654]  You're the eye of the storm.
[02:30:50.574 --> 02:30:52.034]  This is the power of it.
[02:30:53.195 --> 02:30:55.155]  This is the wisdom in it.
[02:30:55.916 --> 02:30:56.716]  And you are it.
[02:30:58.084 --> 02:31:03.688]  Each of us in this game that we're doing together to change the reality of the world.
[02:31:03.748 --> 02:31:12.595]  Now, the other team knows this too, but they function through big organizations that they can then manipulate, infiltrate, screw with, whatever.
[02:31:13.796 --> 02:31:18.800]  I've always said from the very first day I started this, I would do it in a different way.
[02:31:20.281 --> 02:31:24.504]  A group of one, a committee of one, and I would energize a bunch of committees of one.
[02:31:25.104 --> 02:31:25.545]  That's you.
[02:31:26.511 --> 02:31:27.792]  Me, everybody else.
[02:31:28.513 --> 02:31:31.695]  Because at some level we're connected.
[02:31:32.716 --> 02:31:45.006]  But if we begin to act out of something that pushes us, that we're passionate about within our living experience, we'll create very differently.
[02:31:45.246 --> 02:31:55.674]  And if we do it in a spirit of reverence, of divinity even,
[02:31:56.483 --> 02:31:57.964]  Of recognition, even.
[02:31:59.205 --> 02:32:05.130]  Of the truth, even, of what we say we are and behaving that way is really the message in it.
[02:32:05.370 --> 02:32:08.732]  And the experience of it is how we project in the world.
[02:32:08.772 --> 02:32:11.775]  Now, here's the big guys at the top, the Bill Gates.
[02:32:11.915 --> 02:32:22.923]  Once you accumulate wealth, and I've talked about wealth enough in other segments to define it, but I'll get into that a little bit before we get out of this, because I want to talk about the big guys and what motivates them.
[02:32:23.980 --> 02:32:25.342]  As it relates to you and me.
[02:32:25.903 --> 02:32:29.469]  So that we can then recognize the power they recognize.
[02:32:30.631 --> 02:32:34.457]  Only if we can recognize it as a mass of millions.
[02:32:35.218 --> 02:32:36.019]  Guess what?
[02:32:36.781 --> 02:32:37.362]  We win!
[02:32:38.419 --> 02:32:38.899]  We win.
[02:32:39.500 --> 02:32:51.148]  So the message in today's program is grabbing our power back, stopping the looting of the world, and showing, pulling the pants down on the new world order, okay?
[02:32:51.528 --> 02:32:57.072]  Because it's time to wake up and smell the roses and change the game.
[02:32:57.652 --> 02:33:03.176]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, you're listening to InfoWars, and check us out, InfoWars.com.
[02:33:04.907 --> 02:33:06.248]  What a Friday!
[02:33:06.348 --> 02:33:18.832]  You know, here we are 9-11-2020 and man, I was thinking about during the break a couple things to kind of pull a few pieces of the segments together.
[02:33:18.852 --> 02:33:27.095]  I got an email this week from a 16-year-old in South Carolina, maybe he's listening even, and he asked me three questions and I want to
[02:33:27.791 --> 02:33:31.493]  I want to ask and answer myself those questions.
[02:33:31.533 --> 02:33:36.956]  And the first one he asked me was, in the state of affairs, you know, should I go to college?
[02:33:36.976 --> 02:33:42.740]  You know, I've been thinking about being a doctor or a lawyer or, and I want to go into politics someday.
[02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:44.220]  And I'm thinking, wow.
[02:33:44.260 --> 02:33:46.422]  And he says, and I listened to you on InfoWards.
[02:33:46.482 --> 02:33:50.544]  And I'm thinking, I'm being asked, this 16 year old is asking me these questions.
[02:33:50.924 --> 02:33:51.645]  He's listening.
[02:33:52.265 --> 02:33:54.146]  And he's asking me, should I go to college?
[02:33:54.526 --> 02:33:55.767]  Should I invest in that?
[02:33:56.428 --> 02:33:58.529]  Is the world going to fall apart?
[02:33:59.449 --> 02:34:03.231]  Man, that's a pretty heavy-duty question.
[02:34:03.791 --> 02:34:04.532]  What do you say?
[02:34:04.552 --> 02:34:06.773]  And so I want to say it to everybody.
[02:34:06.833 --> 02:34:16.717]  I want to say, you have to know what's happening in the world, but you don't suspend what you're doing, like what's going on with this COVID-19 thing right now.
[02:34:17.675 --> 02:34:23.438]  You have to move forward because you don't know the hour and you don't know the day.
[02:34:23.458 --> 02:34:32.261]  And, you know, and I've lived long enough to see enough the end of the world scenarios to know that, hey, maybe it is, maybe it isn't.
[02:34:32.801 --> 02:34:35.803]  But behave responsibly, not in some panic party.
[02:34:36.263 --> 02:34:41.105]  So plan your life like you would and do it prudently like you should.
[02:34:41.767 --> 02:34:46.270]  Don't get into a big student debt because you'll never escape it if things do fall apart.
[02:34:46.310 --> 02:34:47.291]  So be mindful.
[02:34:47.331 --> 02:34:48.212]  Be sensible.
[02:34:48.752 --> 02:34:50.333]  Approach it maybe a little differently.
[02:34:50.373 --> 02:34:51.914]  Don't rack up a big debt.
[02:34:51.974 --> 02:34:56.798]  And think about what you're going to get educated in and how you're going to get your education.
[02:34:56.998 --> 02:34:58.599]  And where do you want to get it?
[02:34:58.679 --> 02:35:02.462]  And I would advise something else to a 16-year-old or anyone else.
[02:35:03.122 --> 02:35:04.043]  Get a trade.
[02:35:04.403 --> 02:35:10.147]  You know, truck driving, banging nails, carpentry, electrician, and a profession.
[02:35:10.567 --> 02:35:11.028]  Engineer,
[02:35:12.040 --> 02:35:13.281]  Business degree, whatever.
[02:35:13.781 --> 02:35:14.402]  Get them both.
[02:35:14.782 --> 02:35:18.425]  I've done things with my hands and my head my whole life.
[02:35:18.725 --> 02:35:24.290]  Alaskans kind of do this anyway if you live up here very long or lived out of the cities at all.
[02:35:24.830 --> 02:35:26.512]  And so you do, you do both.
[02:35:26.872 --> 02:35:29.454]  And then you're a more equipped human being.
[02:35:29.734 --> 02:35:31.375]  You know, something that we've lost sight of.
[02:35:31.535 --> 02:35:36.359]  And everyone's specialized to the point now where you can't even think about making it.
[02:35:36.379 --> 02:35:36.479]  I can.
[02:35:36.720 --> 02:35:37.120]  I can.
[02:35:39.054 --> 02:35:43.436]  I've learned and I've gained skills and I've collected enough books for what I don't know.
[02:35:43.496 --> 02:35:47.277]  And you see a little glimmer of it behind me and read about 10,000.
[02:35:47.337 --> 02:35:49.398]  I'm not suggesting you got to read 10,000 books.
[02:35:49.638 --> 02:35:53.779]  Be very selective, you know, make sure you got the right material on the shelf.
[02:35:54.979 --> 02:35:56.120]  You don't know how to survive.
[02:35:56.160 --> 02:35:59.541]  You better get some good books to tell you how and practice a few things.
[02:36:00.322 --> 02:36:00.582]  Yes.
[02:36:00.622 --> 02:36:04.505]  But the point of the matter is, the world has always been this way.
[02:36:04.545 --> 02:36:05.506]  There's nothing new.
[02:36:05.586 --> 02:36:07.608]  It's just not happened lately at home.
[02:36:07.628 --> 02:36:10.551]  It's happening everywhere else, somewhere else, right now.
[02:36:11.131 --> 02:36:15.395]  If you travel a lot, like I do, around the world, you see a lot of suffering in the world.
[02:36:16.175 --> 02:36:22.899]  And you thank God every day when you see it up close and personal, what a difference it makes to live in the United States.
[02:36:23.259 --> 02:36:31.003]  Because the next question he asked me was, what country would you go to if the liberals take over and this thing gets even worse?
[02:36:31.263 --> 02:36:31.923]  Where would you go?
[02:36:31.943 --> 02:36:32.003]  Wow.
[02:36:34.084 --> 02:36:39.867]  You know, having traveled all over the world, I'm here.
[02:36:39.888 --> 02:36:42.629]  OK, I'm here.
[02:36:42.649 --> 02:36:43.750]  I'm in the United States.
[02:36:46.471 --> 02:36:50.154]  Wow, you know, do I like parts of the rest of the world?
[02:36:50.194 --> 02:36:52.215]  Yeah, there's a lot of places I've been.
[02:36:52.255 --> 02:36:58.359]  I've been to 50 countries, a lot of them several times, and a lot of them I like to visit.
[02:36:59.620 --> 02:37:06.765]  I like, I wouldn't mind living for a period of time in a lot of places, but no, I think I would stay here.
[02:37:08.034 --> 02:37:11.777]  Even if it gets really nasty and bad, because the other parts of the world are really worse.
[02:37:12.318 --> 02:37:15.780]  And this one we might be able to hold and get back.
[02:37:16.040 --> 02:37:18.402]  And that's kind of where I'm at.
[02:37:18.843 --> 02:37:28.450]  Then the third question he asked me is, okay, if you believe in the United States, and this is the only place we're staying, because he was thinking ahead, he said, what state would you go to?
[02:37:29.110 --> 02:37:36.296]  And now there's an interesting question, you know, maybe the short list is which ones would you avoid, you know, and hey, look around.
[02:37:37.276 --> 02:37:45.602]  You know, I know Oregon, OK, is rioting and you hear about Portland, but a lot of parts of Oregon are very different, much conservative areas of Oregon.
[02:37:45.683 --> 02:37:46.843]  I know I've been there.
[02:37:46.883 --> 02:37:58.332]  I've driven all through Oregon, driven, you know, with an automobile, you know, as I've seen all the United States by automobile, not by jet plane, you know, and by jet plane, too, of course.
[02:37:58.773 --> 02:38:04.377]  But the point I'm making is on the ground, on the ground, it's cities.
[02:38:05.146 --> 02:38:09.308]  Clusters of places where the craziness is going on on steroids.
[02:38:09.769 --> 02:38:15.072]  Now in certain parts of the country it spreads out pretty broadly and I don't like what I see.
[02:38:15.092 --> 02:38:17.493]  And it's a national rollout.
[02:38:17.533 --> 02:38:20.215]  This is what also it's a global rollout.
[02:38:20.315 --> 02:38:24.217]  Really when I see it internationally it plays out with a little
[02:38:25.354 --> 02:38:33.637]  Shape it with a little cultural massage, you know, a little a little window dressing to make the picture look prettier than it actually is.
[02:38:34.197 --> 02:38:44.960]  Or you can say a map to hide behind, you know, a way to obscure the view a bit, get you to look over there when you ought to be looking over here.
[02:38:45.520 --> 02:38:49.782]  But, you know, thinking about this wealth, I was going to talk a little bit about this.
[02:38:51.602 --> 02:38:53.363]  So what state would I go to?
[02:38:54.275 --> 02:38:57.990]  You can evaluate where you're at and you can determine where you want to be.
[02:39:00.385 --> 02:39:01.405]  I like where I am.
[02:39:01.505 --> 02:39:02.566]  I live in Alaska.
[02:39:02.746 --> 02:39:03.666]  I hate the winters.
[02:39:03.746 --> 02:39:08.488]  I got to tell you, I've been through a lot of them, you know, at 61 and being born here.
[02:39:08.528 --> 02:39:11.610]  But the winters are hard as heck, man.
[02:39:11.710 --> 02:39:13.870]  I mean, it's cold and it's dark.
[02:39:14.171 --> 02:39:18.372]  And the darkness is something that's hard to get used to no matter what, you know.
[02:39:18.792 --> 02:39:20.173]  And it's a metaphor, right?
[02:39:20.293 --> 02:39:23.634]  I mean, we go from darkness to light, darkness to light.
[02:39:23.714 --> 02:39:28.596]  That's the cycle of Alaska because we have the midnight sun in the summer and the darkness in the winter.
[02:39:30.825 --> 02:39:33.848]  It's a metaphor for who we all are, right?
[02:39:33.948 --> 02:39:36.591]  I mean, we come out of our own darkness into our light.
[02:39:37.031 --> 02:39:38.793]  Here, we cycle through it every year.
[02:39:38.913 --> 02:39:42.256]  And here's what happens, okay?
[02:39:42.316 --> 02:39:50.824]  As people build, and I talked about wealth and what it is, and as people build wealth, it gets to a point where, hey, what do you need?
[02:39:51.264 --> 02:39:53.286]  What do you want physically, materially?
[02:39:53.887 --> 02:39:54.888]  And there's a point where
[02:39:55.925 --> 02:39:56.905]  You actually have it.
[02:39:56.966 --> 02:40:04.429]  You know, I live in what would be considered a middle class, maybe even a little lighter middle class, because I don't need any more than that.
[02:40:06.510 --> 02:40:13.973]  But it also makes my life a lot simpler, you see, because it operates really efficiently and allows me time.
[02:40:14.134 --> 02:40:16.475]  I get to keep my time and spend it.
[02:40:17.095 --> 02:40:23.398]  See, I spend my time as a priority and I budget my time as a priority.
[02:40:23.438 --> 02:40:25.479]  And that's what we each get to do.
[02:40:26.354 --> 02:40:27.635]  And then we get to program it in.
[02:40:27.675 --> 02:40:34.799]  Now, when you get to retirement age and you have a fixed income, well, hey, then you kind of get this rebirth.
[02:40:35.039 --> 02:40:37.300]  I've witnessed it with a lot of retirees.
[02:40:37.720 --> 02:40:43.003]  Now you got time because your green gasoline is fueling your budget.
[02:40:43.384 --> 02:40:43.984]  So there's this
[02:40:44.730 --> 02:40:46.310]  People with wisdom know this.
[02:40:46.550 --> 02:40:49.311]  It's the retirees that have the power of time.
[02:40:49.371 --> 02:40:51.291]  So you want to create political movements?
[02:40:51.531 --> 02:40:53.012]  Retirees are your answer.
[02:40:53.032 --> 02:40:58.873]  You know, it's look for the blue haired ladies is what someone told me once and they're absolutely correct.
[02:40:59.473 --> 02:41:04.934]  Because it's about people who are committed to doing that make a difference.
[02:41:04.954 --> 02:41:06.994]  And when you get your time back, you get to do more.
[02:41:07.355 --> 02:41:09.795]  Now think about that from a Bill Gates perspective.
[02:41:10.535 --> 02:41:16.700]  Here's a dude that's got, like, all the money under the sun so that money isn't so valuable anymore.
[02:41:17.160 --> 02:41:18.581]  But doing stuff with it is.
[02:41:19.442 --> 02:41:19.722]  Okay?
[02:41:19.742 --> 02:41:23.965]  Because that's just how he creates whatever he thinks he ought to be creating.
[02:41:24.606 --> 02:41:25.967]  But he does it tax-free.
[02:41:26.627 --> 02:41:26.888]  Okay?
[02:41:26.908 --> 02:41:28.168]  He does it tax-exempt.
[02:41:28.749 --> 02:41:33.573]  He does it by screwing you and then BS-ing you.
[02:41:33.593 --> 02:41:33.873]  Okay?
[02:41:34.493 --> 02:41:39.137]  This is what so many nonprofits do that you fail and we fail to see.
[02:41:40.040 --> 02:41:46.686]  Because we think about their public purpose, but what we don't think about is their public influence.
[02:41:47.326 --> 02:41:53.412]  And I want to talk about that because it's about the power of influence that creates outcomes.
[02:41:53.472 --> 02:41:59.077]  When big nonprofits get big money and can influence things in a certain way,
[02:41:59.958 --> 02:42:03.220]  And there's only a certain way they can and a certain way they can't.
[02:42:03.620 --> 02:42:18.928]  And I want to talk about the rules of nonprofits and why they work against you and how they can work for you, but how the big guys use it to screw you and me over with their good works as they pave the road to hell with gold.
[02:42:20.989 --> 02:42:24.971]  And that's the story for today, for the last segment, going into the last segment.
[02:42:24.991 --> 02:42:26.092]  This is Dr. Nick Paget.
[02:42:26.112 --> 02:42:26.732]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:27.754 --> 02:42:30.396]  And welcome, welcome back.
[02:42:30.536 --> 02:42:43.745]  You know, thinking about this again, you know, people ask me all the time, how can you be so, you're always smiling, you know, how can you have that attitude when, when you know all this stuff is going on in the world?
[02:42:44.665 --> 02:42:47.067]  And, and, you know, really, it's a lot of things.
[02:42:47.127 --> 02:42:49.509]  I mean, I can't really explain it in one segment.
[02:42:49.589 --> 02:42:51.270]  I'm not going to even attempt to today.
[02:42:51.330 --> 02:42:51.450]  But
[02:42:52.250 --> 02:43:05.119]  I can tell you it's a lifetime of doing and experiencing and learning from those experiences, both the hard way and sometimes, fortunately, by the grace of God, a little easier ways.
[02:43:07.066 --> 02:43:14.752]  But what I've really come to is I get to do what I love doing, you know, and that's where I am in my life.
[02:43:14.832 --> 02:43:23.158]  And I get to do this every Friday, talk to a few million people, and pass on what I've learned in the week or what's occurred to me at the moment.
[02:43:23.318 --> 02:43:25.499]  And it comes out pretty well, usually.
[02:43:26.100 --> 02:43:27.261]  You know, when I think about
[02:43:29.211 --> 02:43:30.231]  What motivates people?
[02:43:30.271 --> 02:43:32.032]  We were talking about that in the last segment.
[02:43:32.412 --> 02:43:34.413]  And on the big scale, here's how it goes.
[02:43:35.373 --> 02:43:46.297]  Once you've achieved a level of success monetarily, that's kind of like, what are you doing?
[02:43:46.737 --> 02:43:51.139]  And you don't do it just to grab more piles of fiat.
[02:43:51.339 --> 02:43:54.800]  Some people do, but they're chasing a rainbow in a fiction.
[02:43:55.552 --> 02:43:59.876]  To begin with, most people don't acquire big wealth.
[02:44:00.016 --> 02:44:03.419]  What they have is a vision of what they want to do.
[02:44:04.180 --> 02:44:09.424]  And they go after that vision and then they figure out what they get pulled into.
[02:44:09.645 --> 02:44:11.226]  You know, they build a plan around it.
[02:44:11.266 --> 02:44:13.848]  I know Alex built his vision that way.
[02:44:13.909 --> 02:44:15.070]  I built mine that way.
[02:44:15.090 --> 02:44:17.992]  And everybody I know that ever built a vision built it that way.
[02:44:18.112 --> 02:44:18.573]  You did too.
[02:44:19.625 --> 02:44:20.566]  Every one of us did.
[02:44:20.626 --> 02:44:23.187]  Whatever that vision for our life is, we construct it.
[02:44:23.647 --> 02:44:26.209]  And that's what that 16-year-old was really asking me.
[02:44:26.249 --> 02:44:28.650]  And I say, have a vision for your life and go construct it.
[02:44:29.230 --> 02:44:30.051]  Go create it.
[02:44:30.091 --> 02:44:33.413]  In fact, I'd say be the doctor and the lawyer and the politician.
[02:44:33.453 --> 02:44:33.993]  Do them all.
[02:44:34.053 --> 02:44:35.394]  Why should you do just one?
[02:44:36.074 --> 02:44:37.515]  Life could go a long time.
[02:44:37.535 --> 02:44:39.096]  You know, you might get time to do them all.
[02:44:39.136 --> 02:44:39.636]  Do them all.
[02:44:40.497 --> 02:44:41.257]  Be curious.
[02:44:41.377 --> 02:44:42.298]  Be inquisitive.
[02:44:43.338 --> 02:44:44.259]  Stretch your limits.
[02:44:45.026 --> 02:44:46.347]  Figure out what you're about.
[02:44:46.927 --> 02:44:49.768]  Go internal every once in a while and make sure you're doing it right.
[02:44:49.828 --> 02:44:51.309]  You know, test yourself a little bit.
[02:44:52.269 --> 02:45:03.354]  But these guys, once they achieve, and you too, a certain level, and don't make it so high that you're just a consumer, a grabber, a spender, a consumer.
[02:45:04.014 --> 02:45:05.355]  Do it so you're a producer.
[02:45:06.525 --> 02:45:08.285]  That you're creating something.
[02:45:08.526 --> 02:45:11.846]  See, those were those four things I was mentioning, you know, in several segments.
[02:45:12.306 --> 02:45:16.688]  Entrepreneurship, which is creative talent applied to business, right?
[02:45:16.968 --> 02:45:22.729]  And labor, your time, your time, you know, your back, provided into labor.
[02:45:22.809 --> 02:45:30.571]  And then capital equipment, whether it's a shovel, a squeegee, or a factory making stuff, things that make things, that's capital.
[02:45:31.331 --> 02:45:37.274]  Or natural resources and land, the real stuff, you know, that builds real wealth.
[02:45:37.674 --> 02:45:49.340]  Once you have a baseline of subsistence, whatever that represents in your life, in Alaska we can talk about subsistence, in the bush that means something different, but it means really the same thing.
[02:45:49.881 --> 02:45:54.023]  It's about enjoying a way of living that is sufficient for you.
[02:45:55.495 --> 02:46:04.479]  And then after that, it's all about creation and how you use your time, whether it's to spend it with your grandkids or your family or however you decide to do it.
[02:46:04.879 --> 02:46:05.499]  You get to do it.
[02:46:05.539 --> 02:46:08.340]  You get to do all of it along the way.
[02:46:08.960 --> 02:46:16.643]  And the beauty of it is, at the end of the day, whatever you create, it's your responsibility, good or bad.
[02:46:17.543 --> 02:46:19.004]  So choose as well as you can.
[02:46:19.024 --> 02:46:21.965]  And if you've done it, but you think you put the label bad on it,
[02:46:23.181 --> 02:46:25.803]  Dust off, do what you can do and try again.
[02:46:25.823 --> 02:46:27.264]  That's the name of the game.
[02:46:27.705 --> 02:46:39.413]  But when you get to the point of being retired, so you're one of those blue haired men or ladies these days, and you get to go do stuff, do something, you know, because now you're empowered with freedom.
[02:46:40.054 --> 02:46:41.475]  You know, freedom.
[02:46:41.895 --> 02:46:42.656]  Think about this.
[02:46:42.676 --> 02:46:45.498]  And this was going to be my theme today was slavery.
[02:46:46.209 --> 02:46:48.791]  And with the slavery we're in, and when does freedom begin?
[02:46:48.831 --> 02:46:53.173]  And for a lot of people, freedom begins at 65 or 67 or 70.
[02:46:54.414 --> 02:47:04.980]  And think about it, by then, if you stayed healthy, and you've done it at a 90% ratio instead of the 110, you probably got 20 more to go, you know?
[02:47:05.320 --> 02:47:08.622]  And 20 more without having to worry about
[02:47:09.229 --> 02:47:09.609]  I think so.
[02:47:29.244 --> 02:47:38.071]  With a spirit of divinity, of kindness, of graciousness, of the truth of trying to inform, not debate and raise people's anger.
[02:47:38.111 --> 02:47:40.854]  And, you know, we do that, too, because sometimes that's the way it works.
[02:47:41.474 --> 02:47:50.081]  And a lot of folks have talked to me and helped me figure out some things about how we approach change.
[02:47:50.281 --> 02:47:54.244]  And you can do it in all different ways at all different volumes.
[02:47:54.625 --> 02:47:55.505]  OK, and that's OK.
[02:47:56.527 --> 02:48:01.619]  Because everybody responds differently to different approaches to information.
[02:48:01.720 --> 02:48:03.183]  And I think that's the important thing.
[02:48:19.949 --> 02:48:26.291]  President Trump is taking fire from all sides as he continues to reassure the country that he won't stop fighting.
[02:48:26.551 --> 02:48:29.332]  We are returning power to you, the American people.
[02:48:29.932 --> 02:48:41.676]  With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.
[02:48:42.136 --> 02:48:49.958]  The attacks didn't stop Trump from being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, which Trump earned, unlike President Obama.
[02:48:50.198 --> 02:48:58.379]  Meanwhile, Joe Biden's faction of power-hungry New World Order goons is wargaming how to take power, even if Trump is re-elected.
[02:48:58.620 --> 02:49:10.062]  As Jamie White reports, a far-left coalition wargamed several post-election apocalyptic scenarios in case Democrat candidate Joe Biden lost to President Trump.
[02:49:10.222 --> 02:49:21.229]  Predicting that Infowars would get involved by doxing Joe Biden electors and linking 88 of these electors to George Soros and 14 to child sex trafficking.
[02:49:21.469 --> 02:49:28.353]  In a bizarre piece by the Daily Beast entitled, The Left Secretly Preps for MAGA Violence After Election Day,
[02:49:28.593 --> 02:49:45.682]  A group called the Fight Back Table analyzed different election scenarios that draw from the Transition Integrity Project's white paper outlining different election scenarios that included several blue states seceding from America and bringing violence to the streets should Trump win.
[02:49:46.142 --> 02:49:55.187]  It's an organization that emerged at the end of last year that pretends to be a bipartisan group interested in making sure the election is free and fair, but
[02:49:55.936 --> 02:50:05.020]  It's run by George Soros and the Open Society Institute, and it's partnered with a group linked with the Chinese Communist Party, the Berggruen Institute.
[02:50:05.721 --> 02:50:11.883]  One source familiar with the Democracy Defense Nerve Center operation said some of the hurdles were straightforward.
[02:50:11.983 --> 02:50:17.466]  How you occupy, hold space, and shut things down, not just on election day, but for weeks.
[02:50:17.746 --> 02:50:21.568]  Some people expected there to be an answer to who won the election on election night.
[02:50:22.088 --> 02:50:23.630]  I don't think we're necessarily going to get that.
[02:50:24.130 --> 02:50:28.095]  And I think it's important that we start preparing people now.
[02:50:28.275 --> 02:50:34.001]  That there's nothing illegitimate about taking a few extra days or even weeks in order to make sure that all the votes get counted.
[02:50:34.041 --> 02:50:38.686]  In fact, it would be illegitimate if we didn't make sure that all of the ballot votes were counted.
[02:50:38.706 --> 02:50:42.590]  I think that this is important because there is, unfortunately, I think,
[02:50:43.571 --> 02:50:47.473]  If that were to happen, would Facebook be blamed in part?
[02:51:08.845 --> 02:51:17.113]  Others are more complicated, like what quick transportation options can be in place should poll locations mysteriously close.
[02:51:17.334 --> 02:51:21.918]  While others have been simply impossible to plan out, the Daily Beast continued.
[02:51:22.179 --> 02:51:26.163]  But hardball tactics would bring more aggressive responses from the right.
[02:51:27.043 --> 02:51:38.951]  The Simulation for a Narrow Biden Win saw a scenario in which InfoWars published a list of addresses, phone numbers, and other personal information of electors pledged to vote for Joe Biden.
[02:51:39.151 --> 02:51:43.534]  Of course, InfoWars wouldn't publish anything without having evidence to support it.
[02:51:43.815 --> 02:51:47.317]  And why would exposing child trafficking be a bad thing?
[02:51:47.722 --> 02:51:54.088]  You are secretly saving the world from this titanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals.
[02:51:54.208 --> 02:51:58.552]  Does that sound like something you are behind?
[02:51:58.592 --> 02:52:00.033]  Well, I haven't heard that, but...
[02:52:02.586 --> 02:52:06.387]  Is that supposed to be a bad thing or a good thing?
[02:52:06.467 --> 02:52:10.308]  If I can help save the world from problems, I'm willing to do it.
[02:52:10.368 --> 02:52:11.849]  I'm willing to put myself out there.
[02:52:12.509 --> 02:52:21.752]  All of this as professional sleazeball Michael Cohen, who is on house arrest due to tax evasion and campaign violations, attempts to tarnish the president's image.
[02:52:21.972 --> 02:52:25.453]  I described Mr. Trump as a cult leader, and I was in this cult.
[02:52:27.193 --> 02:52:35.292]  While I was in the cult, I was really refusing to acknowledge that the actions that I was performing for my boss were morally wrong.
[02:52:46.118 --> 02:52:49.781]  The Everyday Essentials Special a week ago, it ends on Monday.
[02:52:50.081 --> 02:52:53.444]  That means you've got four days to take advantage of it while I'm cutting this out.

[02:53:25.389 --> 02:53:26.250]  Check it out for yourselves.
[02:53:26.310 --> 02:53:28.191]  And if I was the InfoWar, a 360 win.
[02:53:28.211 --> 02:53:30.833]  The only way you lose is not by taking action.
[02:53:31.134 --> 02:53:32.555]  And I want to explain that again.
[02:53:32.855 --> 02:53:34.837]  Your support of InfoWars.
[02:53:35.197 --> 02:53:39.787]  ...has stood in defiance of George Soros, the globalist Hillary, and all these scumbags.
[02:53:40.068 --> 02:53:40.990]  So great job!
[02:53:41.270 --> 02:53:42.653]  You built what we've done!
[02:53:42.673 --> 02:53:43.716]  I salute you!
[02:53:47.051 --> 02:53:48.012]  Living Defense.
[02:53:48.272 --> 02:53:49.473]  This is beyond a probiotic.
[02:53:49.533 --> 02:53:55.719]  It's got all these things known to flush out the bad little visitors in the guts and really get your guts up to optimum condition.
[02:53:55.739 --> 02:53:57.841]  And have you ever thought probiotics were amazing, which they are?
[02:53:57.861 --> 02:54:00.364]  This is next level and does it in a different way.
[02:54:00.564 --> 02:54:02.105]  It targets and gets rid of bad guys.
[02:54:02.165 --> 02:54:03.447]  It doesn't promote the good guys.
[02:54:03.467 --> 02:54:06.189]  Because when you get rid of the bad guys, the good guys can operate.
[02:54:06.249 --> 02:54:07.450]  The New World Order is targeting your gut.
[02:54:07.530 --> 02:54:09.532]  Living Defense is the best, most powerful formula.
[02:54:09.652 --> 02:54:10.693]  And it is a big bottle.
[02:54:10.874 --> 02:54:11.795]  Let me show TV viewers this.
[02:54:12.355 --> 02:54:13.015]  It's a brand new bottle.
[02:54:13.035 --> 02:54:14.516]  Remember, I haven't taken this in about six months.
[02:54:14.616 --> 02:54:15.557]  I take it about twice a year.
[02:54:15.837 --> 02:54:16.197]  Look at this.
[02:54:16.337 --> 02:54:16.897]  Look at that.
[02:54:16.977 --> 02:54:17.317]  Look at this.
[02:54:17.417 --> 02:54:18.738]  Damn, it's going all over the floor everywhere.
[02:54:18.758 --> 02:54:19.718]  There's so many of them.
[02:54:19.798 --> 02:54:20.119]  Hold on.
[02:54:20.159 --> 02:54:20.579]  There you go.
[02:54:20.719 --> 02:54:21.739]  I mean, what's going on the floor?
[02:54:21.819 --> 02:54:22.820]  These babies are amazing.
[02:54:22.860 --> 02:54:27.842]  You take a few of these a day for a month, you're going to have some results that are, let's just say, magnificent.
[02:54:28.022 --> 02:54:30.123]  And this is Mother Nature gave us.
[02:54:30.223 --> 02:54:31.244]  God gave us Mother Nature.
[02:54:31.364 --> 02:54:33.425]  It is LivingDefenseInfoWarStore.com.
[02:54:33.545 --> 02:54:34.605]  And you find the Info War.
[02:54:34.645 --> 02:54:36.686]  So it's a total win-win, win-win-win.
[02:54:36.886 --> 02:54:37.947]  InfoWarStore.com.
[02:54:50.759 --> 02:54:53.001]  Please remember that it's down to the wire.
[02:54:54.322 --> 02:54:59.986]  When I say please tell people about Band.Video or NewsWorks.com or InfoWorks.com, people are ready to hear the truth.
[02:55:00.407 --> 02:55:01.948]  Everything is basically censored now.
[02:55:03.109 --> 02:55:04.890]  We built our own system to be able to do this.
[02:55:04.970 --> 02:55:06.311]  We're on over 200 radio stations.
[02:55:06.331 --> 02:55:08.293]  We're on over 100 TV stations and cable stations.
[02:55:08.353 --> 02:55:09.674]  And we've got Band.Video.
[02:55:09.734 --> 02:55:11.255]  Get the videos from Band.Video.
[02:55:11.295 --> 02:55:11.916]  Get the articles.
[02:55:12.096 --> 02:55:16.157]  So many videos, so many films, so many reports can only be found at Bandot Video.
[02:55:16.297 --> 02:55:22.840]  All these top medical doctors can't even come out and say what happened with their patients or their band, and now they're getting in trouble, and now they're losing their licenses.
[02:55:22.940 --> 02:55:24.040]  I mean, this is terror!
[02:55:24.300 --> 02:55:32.063]  And we're under massive attack, massive infiltration, massive globalist operations that I can't even get to on air, but your prayers are keeping us in the fight.
[02:55:32.403 --> 02:55:35.866]  So just thank you so much, and please don't forget, the Storable Food Company we have is the best.
[02:55:35.966 --> 02:55:37.327]  It ships in one to two weeks now.

[02:55:46.514 --> 02:55:54.421]  Take this lull where they've gotten caught up on food shipments to get your orders in before what's coming, because even if Trump wins, even if we stabilize stuff, they're going to start a civil war after that.
[02:55:54.701 --> 02:55:56.383]  If it loses, it's going to go to hell on earth.
[02:55:56.464 --> 02:55:57.445]  And I don't just say that.
[02:55:57.906 --> 02:56:00.049]  I'm having talks with my wife, my parents, my family.
[02:56:00.349 --> 02:56:01.631]  We're getting right with Jesus, folks.
[02:56:02.032 --> 02:56:03.854]  It's on like Donkey Kong.
[02:56:04.015 --> 02:56:05.397]  So, infowarrestore.com.

[02:56:08.061 --> 02:56:08.601]  Thank you so much.
[02:56:15.384 --> 02:56:28.154]  The Betsy Ross flag combined with the Don't Tread on Me Gadsden flag are two founding images of our republic, are two iconic images that let us remember what makes our country so great.
[02:56:28.574 --> 02:56:34.299]  Rugged individualism, the revolutionary spirit to launch the greatest, freest nation in the world's history.
[02:56:34.999 --> 02:56:41.865]  An American system that threatens the global corporate anti-human system, a system they must discredit and destroy.
[02:56:42.270 --> 02:56:46.573]  If they believe they're going to extinguish the light of liberty in the hearts and minds of humans across this planet.
[02:56:46.793 --> 02:56:51.677]  You can find this powerful t-shirt and many others at InfoWarsStore.com today.
[02:56:51.897 --> 02:56:55.560]  And on the back, it's got the iconic America's Back InfoWars.com.

[02:57:02.726 --> 02:57:06.669]  And your purchase funds the InfoWars and spreads the word in the third dimension.
[02:57:06.889 --> 02:57:08.250]  Take action now, Paul Reveres.
[02:57:08.470 --> 02:57:10.752]  Get this shirt and others at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:57:16.104 --> 02:57:19.486]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[02:57:19.506 --> 02:57:20.667]  They're going to contest the election.
[02:57:20.687 --> 02:57:22.108]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[02:57:22.428 --> 02:57:23.809]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[02:57:23.910 --> 02:57:24.930]  I want them shut down.
[02:57:24.990 --> 02:57:25.871]  I want them silenced.
[02:57:25.931 --> 02:57:26.651]  I want them muted.
[02:57:26.672 --> 02:57:28.553]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:57:28.593 --> 02:57:29.534]  You kept us on air.
[02:57:29.654 --> 02:57:30.955]  We did the analysis first.
[02:57:31.215 --> 02:57:32.235]  It's now gone mainstream.
[02:57:32.295 --> 02:57:34.097]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[02:57:34.377 --> 02:57:40.281]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[02:57:40.481 --> 02:57:41.942]  And you need to stop right now.
[02:57:42.042 --> 02:57:43.083]  And they're very, very serious.
[02:57:43.243 --> 02:57:45.585]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[02:57:45.725 --> 02:57:48.446]  This is not going to happen, so they are moving now to destroy me.
[02:57:48.906 --> 02:57:51.327]  I used to say support InfoWars, rescue InfoWars.
[02:57:51.447 --> 02:57:53.088]  Save yourself, save the world.
[02:57:53.408 --> 02:57:54.268]  We're in this together.
[02:57:54.369 --> 02:57:56.009]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:57:56.029 --> 02:58:00.151]  Communism's up here, InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[02:58:00.551 --> 02:58:02.392]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[02:58:02.592 --> 02:58:04.133]  My children are right here!
[02:58:04.873 --> 02:58:06.594]  But I need money to fight a war!
[02:58:06.814 --> 02:58:07.854]  And I need word of mouth!
[02:58:08.074 --> 02:58:08.975]  And I need prayer!
[02:58:09.135 --> 02:58:10.075]  And I need action!
[02:58:10.435 --> 02:58:12.036]  Because that dam's going to come down!
[02:58:12.756 --> 02:58:14.717]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
