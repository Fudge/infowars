[00:00:00.369 --> 00:00:04.793]  And man, I mean, I look at that governor up there that on purpose sends people infected to nursing homes.
[00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:07.395]  I mean, that's like the default thing you don't do.
[00:00:07.435 --> 00:00:10.718]  Like, don't throw a newborn baby in the deep end of the pool.
[00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.720]  And she's got the baby throwing it right in the pool.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.023]  It's like, don't go in a fireworks factory with a flamethrower lit.
[00:00:18.003 --> 00:00:19.825]  Or don't pour gasoline on yourself and light it.
[00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:23.688]  Don't jump in the backyard with 15 starving pit bulls.
[00:00:23.988 --> 00:00:27.071]  Don't go to the local zoo and climb in the Bengal tiger cage.
[00:00:27.918 --> 00:00:30.179]  I mean, don't take a bottle of cyanide!
[00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:32.200]  Don't chop your dick off!
[00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.501]  Excuse me, but this is ridiculous!
[00:00:36.362 --> 00:00:51.929]  The default position is keep infectious patients away from the nursing homes and Democrats in unison and globalists from Europe to Australia to the United States, ship them in there to call their asses!
[00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:10.662]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this May 26, Tuesday, global transmission with exactly 160 days out from the incredibly important election.
[00:01:11.923 --> 00:01:19.868]  Well, it's come out that the New York Times put a bunch of fake names of people that died from gunshot wounds, car accidents in their list of 100,000 people that had died.
[00:01:22.611 --> 00:01:24.713]  And now Washington State's been caught doing it again.
[00:01:24.773 --> 00:01:27.435]  Gunshot victims count as coronavirus deaths in Washington State.
[00:01:28.295 --> 00:01:31.158]  The whole thing is a criminal fraud working in unison together.
[00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:32.899]  And the whole facade's starting to crumble.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:44.388]  I'm talking about all the real numbers and real actuaries coming out of big banks and insurance companies in the United States, South Africa, Japan, Europe.
[00:01:45.797 --> 00:01:58.292]  Showing that the lockdowns are a hoax, and that COVID-19 is a hoax, and that everyone dying of other diseases is counted as COVID-19, and is the biggest fraud the planet has ever seen.
[00:01:58.692 --> 00:02:02.277]  Over the course of the next few months, and certainly the year,
[00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:08.137]  More people in the world will have died because of the lockdowns than because of the virus.
[00:02:09.198 --> 00:02:23.682]  And when you realize that there were no lockdowns in 1969 when 100,000 Americans died, and I remind you, much smaller population in the United States then, so that might be equivalent to perhaps 150,000 today.
[00:02:23.702 --> 00:02:24.002]  No lockdowns.
[00:02:27.463 --> 00:02:28.864]  We live in a different age.
[00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:32.367]  We do not value freedom because the left is in charge.
[00:02:32.567 --> 00:02:34.148]  The left has never valued freedom.
[00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:40.153]  From Marx to the Democratic Party today, it is simply not one of their values.
[00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:45.758]  They may believe in equality, they may believe in government, but they do not believe in liberty.
[00:02:46.238 --> 00:02:56.627]  How many people on the left, in their hearts, value the idea, as this is Memorial Day weekend, that people died for liberty?
[00:02:57.597 --> 00:02:59.879]  We're not even prepared to live for liberty.
[00:02:59.899 --> 00:03:05.363]  This is the most serious crisis in American history since the Civil War.
[00:03:05.603 --> 00:03:15.290]  The neuroses and the mental illness that it's manifested is going to take generations to go away unless we all start speaking out against the hoax.
[00:03:16.551 --> 00:03:23.016]  Now there is a real virus that came out of a weapons lab and it has great gain of function so a lot of people get it.
[00:03:23.816 --> 00:03:25.718]  So you can all be suspect.
[00:03:27.168 --> 00:03:34.431]  And so that in test it will match regular coronaviruses, one of the most common forms of death, so they can create fear.
[00:03:36.112 --> 00:03:38.833]  It is a fear weapon.
[00:03:40.373 --> 00:03:40.813]  Period.
[00:03:41.694 --> 00:03:49.497]  Supreme Court of Brazil has ordered a Bolsonaro video to be released from a private cabinet meeting he was having.
[00:03:50.357 --> 00:03:53.158]  And it shows that he's just as real as we all knew he was.
[00:03:53.798 --> 00:03:54.719]  This broadcast
[00:03:55.563 --> 00:03:57.025]  And the feet and legs you gave it.
[00:03:57.286 --> 00:03:58.127]  We're in this together.
[00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:04.437]  Has put Bolsonaro, thanks to his incredible courage, and that's brutally stabbed and survived.
[00:04:04.457 --> 00:04:05.358]  The guy is amazing.
[00:04:06.328 --> 00:04:08.149]  And quite frankly, I think more hardcore than Trump.
[00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:09.589]  Listen to this guy.
[00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.811]  It was decided not long ago that you couldn't handcuff almost no one.
[00:04:13.311 --> 00:04:17.733]  Why are they putting handcuffs on citizens that's working or a woman in a public square?
[00:04:18.473 --> 00:04:19.794]  You have to effing speak.
[00:04:20.534 --> 00:04:22.355]  You're going to be quiet.
[00:04:22.615 --> 00:04:23.195]  Until when?
[00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:26.056]  Or do I have to keep on exposing this myself?
[00:04:26.596 --> 00:04:27.417]  You have to speak.
[00:04:27.597 --> 00:04:28.177]  Put it out there.
[00:04:28.197 --> 00:04:28.777]  Dish it out.
[00:04:29.138 --> 00:04:32.239]  You can't put handcuffs, a decision, on the Supreme Court itself.
[00:04:33.348 --> 00:04:35.129]  And we're going to be quiet until when?
[00:04:35.489 --> 00:04:38.210]  They keep on humiliating our people, and that's growing.
[00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:40.911]  People keep on pointing at me.
[00:04:41.211 --> 00:04:43.752]  I voted on you for you to do something.
[00:04:45.752 --> 00:04:47.973]  Voted on you so you make decisions.
[00:04:49.534 --> 00:04:49.994]  And it's true.
[00:04:52.135 --> 00:04:54.596]  I couldn't care less with the re-election.
[00:04:55.196 --> 00:04:57.076]  And we have to think about that, all of us.
[00:04:58.677 --> 00:05:01.498]  What these sons of bitches want is our freedom.
[00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:06.843]  Look, look how easy it is to impose a dictatorship in Brazil.
[00:05:07.103 --> 00:05:07.824]  How easy it is.
[00:05:08.865 --> 00:05:09.867]  Well, here's the good news.
[00:05:10.928 --> 00:05:19.499]  We have judges in Illinois moving to override the unconstitutional continued lockdown order of the bureaucrats.
[00:05:20.523 --> 00:05:32.789]  We have Trump coming out on Friday and saying that he is saying the states are open and that religious services are essential or he will override the governors and that is a federal issue because it is the First Amendment.
[00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:34.270]  That's how the First Amendment begins.
[00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:43.795]  For those that don't know, Congress shall make no law respecting an established religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or the press or the right of the people.
[00:05:45.393 --> 00:05:52.254]  We must declare war on the giant, organized, global government fraud that is COVID-19.
[00:05:53.134 --> 00:06:03.316]  We must tell every person we walk past in the street, or at church, or at work, everywhere we go, from the grocery store, to the five and dime, to the gas station.
[00:06:04.136 --> 00:06:07.597]  We have to declare COVID-19 is a hoax.
[00:06:08.077 --> 00:06:10.177]  COVID-19 is medical tyranny.
[00:06:10.657 --> 00:06:14.458]  COVID-19 is permanent medical martial law.
[00:06:16.108 --> 00:06:17.529]  160 days out from the election.
[00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:18.689]  The final countdown.
[00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.690]  Tuesday, May 26th, 2020.
[00:06:23.211 --> 00:06:24.531]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:24.811 --> 00:06:26.692]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:06:27.172 --> 00:06:28.392]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us.
[00:06:28.472 --> 00:06:29.713]  Max Keiser, your calls.
[00:06:30.848 --> 00:06:33.329]  Then there's The War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:06:33.369 --> 00:06:36.810]  with the great Owen Schroyer, of course, right before this transmission every day.
[00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.731]  David Knight and The David Knight Show.
[00:06:38.771 --> 00:06:41.292]  You want real research, a lot of great documentation.
[00:06:41.312 --> 00:06:42.593]  David does a fabulous job.
[00:06:43.053 --> 00:06:44.513]  That is 8 a.m.
[00:06:44.533 --> 00:06:45.214]  to 11 a.m.
[00:06:45.254 --> 00:06:45.594]  Central.
[00:06:45.914 --> 00:06:46.334]  Okay.
[00:06:48.635 --> 00:06:56.478]  I know all of you know this, but we have over 200 radio affiliates and we have a lot of TV affiliates and there are new people tuning in every day.
[00:06:59.455 --> 00:07:05.796]  And they hear us talk about things and they wonder, because they've heard the media say I'm a liar, is that really true?
[00:07:06.356 --> 00:07:23.279]  You know, when I get up here and I say the original models from February, financed in England and in the United States by Bill and Melinda Gates, the usual suspects, said that there'd be 2.2 million dead by now in the United States and 500 plus thousand dead by now in the United Kingdom.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.580]  Of course, it's not anywhere near that.
[00:07:30.148 --> 00:07:51.346]  And you can pull up those numbers for yourself, but let me just get an overhead shot here so I can give people the actual articles, the place to get it for themselves, because we're going to go over these numbers because it's important to understand that the general public knows they're being lied to, but they don't know how severely.
[00:07:51.366 --> 00:07:54.728]  And so you have to show them the facts.
[00:07:55.623 --> 00:08:08.209]  And that's why we're creating a special section on InfoWars that has short little two-minute videos that'll be done in about a week, and then just links to articles and links to graphs showing the bibliography to people so you can send it out to everyone you know.
[00:08:08.229 --> 00:08:11.851]  We're going to create a site that isn't banned yet.
[00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:16.773]  Of course, InfoWars is banned from being shared on many platforms, but you can still word-of-mouth share it.
[00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:19.705]  But this is the fight.
[00:08:19.865 --> 00:08:26.651]  Exposing this hoax, exposing this fraud, and exposing specifically how the fraud works is key.
[00:08:27.592 --> 00:08:33.378]  Just like folks exposed that man-made global warming didn't exist, it was a giant global government carbon tax takeover.
[00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.041]  It took decades to defeat it.
[00:08:37.182 --> 00:08:40.445]  They spent hundreds of billions of dollars to push it, but it's dead on arrival.
[00:08:41.653 --> 00:08:56.486]  Well, this whole lockdown, global government surveillance system was already being beta tested by the Rockefellers, the Chi-Coms, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on record, with Lockstep and Event 201 and the rest of them.
[00:08:56.506 --> 00:08:57.407]  And Bill Gates admits that.
[00:08:57.447 --> 00:09:00.229]  He calls this a drill on national TV now.
[00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:02.611]  He says, oh, this is the test.
[00:09:02.651 --> 00:09:03.832]  You know, this isn't that bad.
[00:09:03.992 --> 00:09:05.413]  There's something a lot worse coming.
[00:09:06.354 --> 00:09:08.136]  Bio-weapons terrorists are going to release it.
[00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:12.420]  So this is all the marbles.
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:13.620]  It's the medical tyranny.
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.701]  It's always been that.
[00:09:14.961 --> 00:09:19.882]  The excuse for the surveillance, the excuse for the snitch groups, the excuse for the forced inoculations.
[00:09:20.003 --> 00:09:21.743]  It's the whole enchilada.
[00:09:22.143 --> 00:09:28.006]  And that digital database proving you've been given all your inoculations will be used as the global currency.
[00:09:29.406 --> 00:09:30.927]  And that's all official as well.
[00:09:31.267 --> 00:09:38.650]  And your medical subservience, your medical slavery, submitting your body to the state and these megacorporations and the UN,
[00:09:40.089 --> 00:09:41.190]  Is your religious sacrament.
[00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:44.012]  You don't take the blood of Christ, the body of Christ.
[00:09:45.092 --> 00:09:48.855]  You take the Bill of Melinda Gates seed into your body.
[00:09:48.915 --> 00:09:51.236]  And we've got amazing deep research on that today.
[00:09:51.276 --> 00:09:52.197]  We'll be getting into as well.
[00:09:53.538 --> 00:09:56.320]  But let's just look at a smattering of these articles.
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.360]  Now this is the really big news.
[00:09:58.121 --> 00:10:06.866]  Imperial College scientist who predicted 500,000 dead from coronavirus in UK adjust figure to 20K.
[00:10:10.063 --> 00:10:10.683]  Confusion!
[00:10:10.743 --> 00:10:14.305]  Imperial College Scientist 500,000 coronavirus deaths projection.
[00:10:15.966 --> 00:10:18.908]  White House takes aim after dire report on death toll.
[00:10:20.869 --> 00:10:23.110]  They said it'd be 2.2 million, but it wasn't.
[00:10:23.631 --> 00:10:28.213]  It's 100,000 and that's totally inflated.
[00:10:28.853 --> 00:10:32.876]  Epidemiologist behind highly cytic coronavirus model drastically downgrades projection.
[00:10:34.278 --> 00:10:36.799]  How one model simulated 2.2 million U.S.
[00:10:36.819 --> 00:10:38.220]  deaths from COVID-19.
[00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:39.000]  Cato.org.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.841]  It's all right there, but let's look at the new stuff today.
[00:10:41.861 --> 00:10:49.585]  Because, you know, they only did it 10 to 1, 15 to 1, 20 to 1 on these models here in the United States and the UK.
[00:10:50.445 --> 00:10:55.127]  In places like Sweden and Germany, they had it 40 to 1, 50 to 1, the death toll.
[00:10:55.507 --> 00:10:57.128]  Same thing in Brazil.
[00:10:57.148 --> 00:10:59.169]  They were saying a million are going to die.
[00:10:59.549 --> 00:11:00.490]  Last time I checked, it's like 30,000.
[00:11:03.857 --> 00:11:08.602]  And again, globally, their standardized healthcare systems and insurance companies are global.
[00:11:09.182 --> 00:11:13.366]  And so, if you say someone died of COVID-19, you get way more money.
[00:11:13.426 --> 00:11:14.107]  That's on record.
[00:11:14.767 --> 00:11:18.951]  In the United States, it's almost $14,000 to say you have a COVID patient, period, in the building.
[00:11:18.971 --> 00:11:21.033]  Just pure cash on you.
[00:11:22.354 --> 00:11:22.675]  Up front.
[00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:30.034]  Then if you stick a tube down their throat and intubate them, that's an extra 39 smackers.
[00:11:31.055 --> 00:11:31.435]  39 grand.
[00:11:31.695 --> 00:11:34.277]  And then it just gravy trains on from there.
[00:11:35.558 --> 00:11:36.619]  Gravy trains.
[00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:38.120]  And here's what's incredible.
[00:11:39.401 --> 00:11:41.763]  They're not even trying to hide any of this now.
[00:11:41.863 --> 00:11:43.565]  But let's get to the new big ones.
[00:11:44.565 --> 00:11:49.589]  You've seen the meme that, oh yeah, a great white shark attacked a lady and they called it COVID-19.
[00:11:51.604 --> 00:11:54.186]  That meme is a joke, but where it comes from isn't.
[00:11:54.426 --> 00:11:57.828]  This is just in the news today at nationalfile.com.
[00:11:57.848 --> 00:12:00.389]  We're going to post this article on infowars.com.
[00:12:00.810 --> 00:12:05.853]  Gunshot victims count as coronavirus deaths in Washington state.
[00:12:05.893 --> 00:12:07.534]  This is some real original reporting.
[00:12:08.454 --> 00:12:13.838]  Freedom Foundation reports did a Freedom Information Act request and they admitted
[00:12:15.239 --> 00:12:23.144]  Gunshot wounds, car wrecks, suicides, and then they test you with the Bill and Melinda Gates U.N.
[00:12:24.264 --> 00:12:26.746]  testing kit that the FDA shut down for fraud.
[00:12:28.267 --> 00:12:35.131]  And the kit finds almost everyone is positive if you've had the flu or a coronavirus on average the last decade.
[00:12:36.092 --> 00:12:38.533]  So at least they get vaccines every decade or so, quote, immunity goes away.
[00:12:38.553 --> 00:12:39.434]  That's pretty accurate.
[00:12:39.454 --> 00:12:44.757]  But if you've had a cold virus or you've had a flu virus, you have the detritus in your body from that fight.
[00:12:45.674 --> 00:12:48.915]  You have the wreckage of it, not the antibodies, just the genetic wreckage.
[00:12:49.275 --> 00:12:54.976]  And so, everyone that's had a cold or the flu in the last 10 years, baby, you got corona!
[00:12:56.437 --> 00:12:57.797]  And that's only one type of test.
[00:12:57.837 --> 00:13:02.878]  And I told you it was a fraud, and now it's come out that Bill and Melinda Gates are financing the main test, and it's a damn fraud!
[00:13:03.138 --> 00:13:05.479]  Not approved, and a damn fraud!
[00:13:07.219 --> 00:13:10.440]  But that's only one level to the juiciness, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:12.491]  Look at this article.
[00:13:12.531 --> 00:13:15.792]  Gunshot victims count as coronavirus deaths in Washington State.
[00:13:18.554 --> 00:13:20.675]  And it goes over the entire thing.
[00:13:25.058 --> 00:13:25.458]  Unbelievable.
[00:13:25.478 --> 00:13:25.918]  Here's another one.
[00:13:25.938 --> 00:13:26.458]  New York Times.
[00:13:26.979 --> 00:13:27.139]  U.S.
[00:13:27.179 --> 00:13:29.280]  deaths near 100,000 since last Friday.
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.201]  An incalculable loss.
[00:13:32.002 --> 00:13:34.243]  Sixth name on the New York Times list.
[00:13:34.563 --> 00:13:36.944]  Six in of coronavirus victims.
[00:13:37.024 --> 00:13:39.386]  A 27-year-old man who was murdered.
[00:13:40.626 --> 00:13:48.049]  Murdered when you get stabbed, when you get shot, you are a COVID-19 death.
[00:13:48.209 --> 00:13:50.230]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is all happening.
[00:13:51.111 --> 00:13:52.511]  This is how dumb they think you are.
[00:13:53.051 --> 00:13:53.852]  How suggestible.
[00:13:55.072 --> 00:14:03.396]  And that's why 80% in the United States of COVID-19 deaths are over the age
[00:14:04.383 --> 00:14:05.684]  Look it up for yourself.
[00:14:06.184 --> 00:14:07.145]  It's the same thing in Europe.
[00:14:07.505 --> 00:14:09.327]  It's the same thing everywhere because it's a fraud.
[00:14:09.407 --> 00:14:30.001]  You die when you've got all these other diseases and kidney failure and liver failure and lung cancer and bone cancer and brain cancer and they come in and stick a test in you that's designed to be a fraud when you croak and they say it's COVID so you can scare the living daylights out of the public and I know all of you know this so I'm gonna say this.
[00:14:31.382 --> 00:14:33.483]  We'll post the clip from this show
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:40.145]  Today, we're building a site that shows all the facts, so folks don't have to look it up for themselves, they can just click right there.
[00:14:40.626 --> 00:14:41.306]  We're making it easy.
[00:14:41.907 --> 00:14:42.667]  But do you understand?
[00:14:43.388 --> 00:14:47.932]  When we come back, what they're going to do, they're going to have another lockdown around the election.
[00:14:48.172 --> 00:14:49.133]  It's never going to end.
[00:14:49.193 --> 00:14:50.414]  It makes the UN the boss.
[00:14:51.415 --> 00:14:53.417]  It's meant to devastate the first world economy.
[00:14:53.717 --> 00:14:57.060]  China is exempting themselves, says they're over it, they're not going to have more lockdowns.
[00:14:57.501 --> 00:14:59.623]  This is a fraudulent takeover.
[00:15:00.762 --> 00:15:02.763]  This is an economic warfare operation.
[00:15:03.103 --> 00:15:10.448]  And the Pentagon has come out and said that this is China's Chernobyl, and that China covered it up to deliberately hurt us.
[00:15:10.568 --> 00:15:11.268]  It's worse than that.
[00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:12.990]  They released the damn thing.
[00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:23.016]  You've got top scientists in Australia, in India, in Germany, in the US, in France, in Canada, all coming out, scan the virus.
[00:15:23.056 --> 00:15:26.638]  They said, this thing is so man-made, it's ridiculous.
[00:15:28.179 --> 00:15:29.620]  People go, well then you can't have it both ways, Alex.
[00:15:31.072 --> 00:15:31.773]  Yes, we can.
[00:15:31.913 --> 00:15:32.594]  It's man-made.
[00:15:32.614 --> 00:15:33.535]  I'll tell you why when we come back.
[00:15:34.596 --> 00:15:37.279]  We are back live, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:15:37.319 --> 00:15:38.621]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:15:39.462 --> 00:15:44.588]  Okay, so I'm just going to restate this because this is the entire shooting match.
[00:15:44.628 --> 00:15:49.834]  It's the entire spectrum of what we're dealing with as a society and as a culture.
[00:15:52.074 --> 00:16:01.346]  Every facet of the COVID-19 rollout was scripted and battle-planned and prepared by the most powerful globalist foundations and corporations on earth, publicly.
[00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:07.795]  Every facet of it has been a giant, premeditated, complete and total lie.
[00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:18.894]  And the agenda of where it's taking us is a true dystopia.
[00:16:19.155 --> 00:16:30.707]  You already noticed that just 73 days into the forced police state lockdown, in some areas of Europe, they're into month number four and a half.
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:36.641]  You notice it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:16:36.661 --> 00:16:55.325]  And the more we submit, the more they squeeze to see what they can get out of you because they're trying to erase thousands of years of progress of humans standing up and demanding liberty and paying for it in blood and in treasure and in time and in everything else.
[00:16:58.366 --> 00:16:58.826]  So that's
[00:17:00.097 --> 00:17:08.265]  What we face as a culture, and as a society, and as a planet.
[00:17:13.269 --> 00:17:20.756]  And we can sit here and let these criminal liars get away with what they're doing, or we can stand up to them.
[00:17:22.197 --> 00:17:25.801]  Every grocery store I go in, every
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:34.864]  Gas station I go into, every restaurant I go into now that they're reopened partially.
[00:17:35.665 --> 00:17:38.007]  When the waitress walks up, I say, you can take that mask off.
[00:17:38.027 --> 00:17:45.014]  Well, we were ordered to and I say, but you know, they're counting every death, car wrecks, gunshot wounds, people that had cancer as COVID-19.
[00:17:45.414 --> 00:17:46.495]  They're like, yeah, I heard that.
[00:17:47.116 --> 00:17:48.958]  And most people are actually somewhat informed.
[00:17:55.509 --> 00:17:58.152]  And most people I talk to actually already know all this.
[00:17:58.252 --> 00:18:01.416]  And then I say to them, I say, then you need to tell other people.
[00:18:01.776 --> 00:18:05.540]  You need to let them know it's a fraud.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.304]  And this female waitress was sitting there yesterday and she said, you're right, I need to.
[00:18:10.266 --> 00:18:14.851]  And her and the manager and the other person took their mask off and said, this is all just a giant hoax.
[00:18:19.431 --> 00:18:24.974]  And then I sat there and exchanged phone numbers with her and said, I'm going to send you articles and documentation.
[00:18:24.994 --> 00:18:25.415]  And I did.
[00:18:25.435 --> 00:18:29.377]  And I wasn't hitting on her, even though she was attractive.
[00:18:31.858 --> 00:18:36.521]  That's what it's going to take to beat these people is just simple, selling the truth, selling the truth.
[00:18:38.222 --> 00:18:47.628]  And look, I've been doing this full time for like two months since the mask went on in Texas and all the hysteria and all the garbage.
[00:18:48.943 --> 00:18:51.425]  I have been talking to hike and bike trail.
[00:18:51.765 --> 00:18:53.506]  Somebody goes like this and gets back from me.
[00:18:53.626 --> 00:18:56.008]  I start talking to him very nicely, but lay out the facts.
[00:18:57.449 --> 00:19:01.492]  And you'll find that most people were just going along with it because they think it's peer pressure and what they're supposed to do.
[00:19:02.693 --> 00:19:04.734]  Others think they're heroes because they're buying into it.
[00:19:04.794 --> 00:19:12.460]  And what they're buying into is the total destruction of civilization and society.
[00:19:14.541 --> 00:19:15.322]  The takedown
[00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:23.212]  of the free market capitalist civilization because the globalists have decided they want to not just a post-human world, a post-industrial world.
[00:19:24.532 --> 00:19:26.273]  And so this is economic warfare.
[00:19:26.893 --> 00:19:31.094]  And they script it like, oh, you're heroes, you know, not opening your company.
[00:19:31.214 --> 00:19:33.075]  Oh, you're heroes getting that welfare check.
[00:19:33.535 --> 00:19:35.176]  Oh, you're heroes wearing that mask.
[00:19:35.356 --> 00:19:36.216]  Oh, you're such heroes.
[00:19:36.276 --> 00:19:39.757]  And really, you're buying into a giant premeditated fraud.
[00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:49.959]  People say to me, Alex, wait a minute, you first said with experts back in late January that COVID-19 was a man-made bioweapon out of the Wuhan bioweapon lab.
[00:19:50.980 --> 00:19:52.021]  Well, that's so deadly.
[00:19:52.261 --> 00:19:53.402]  It's a bioweapon.
[00:19:53.682 --> 00:19:53.843]  No, no, no.
[00:19:53.983 --> 00:19:55.124]  It's a psychological weapon.
[00:19:56.465 --> 00:20:01.910]  But you need to have, again, a cold virus that's man-made so you can finally own it.
[00:20:02.958 --> 00:20:20.648]  And finally have an artificial mutation whose baby mutations you've already tested in labs, in tissue cultures, so that it stays around a long time and so you can own it and make money off of it and have tests that find it in everyone.
[00:20:20.949 --> 00:20:23.210]  So it has incredible gain of function.
[00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:29.554]  Two different main varieties, as you know, hundreds of sub varieties of each, but one is very easy to catch.
[00:20:30.851 --> 00:20:33.554]  But isn't very harmful.
[00:20:33.774 --> 00:20:37.218]  One, it does have a high kill rate for a respiratory cold.
[00:20:38.078 --> 00:20:40.161]  It's nasty, but a lot of nasty stuff.
[00:20:40.901 --> 00:20:41.582]  And it's hard to get.
[00:20:42.043 --> 00:20:43.324]  They engineered all that.
[00:20:43.944 --> 00:20:45.486]  And it's come out how they engineered it.
[00:20:46.387 --> 00:20:52.713]  And they had documentaries in 2015 in Wuhan bragging for Italian TV how they were testing weaponized chimeras
[00:20:53.863 --> 00:20:57.004]  of the coronavirus family on humans.
[00:20:57.885 --> 00:20:59.466]  So we knew they were lying about it.
[00:20:59.506 --> 00:21:00.746]  We knew the NIH funded it.
[00:21:00.766 --> 00:21:01.847]  We knew Obama did it.
[00:21:02.027 --> 00:21:02.987]  We knew it was man-made.
[00:21:03.007 --> 00:21:05.068]  There was a major controversy five years ago.
[00:21:07.209 --> 00:21:16.854]  And so, yes, ladies and gentlemen, we have to expose these monsters because the very people that engineered it all are the ones now posing
[00:21:17.956 --> 00:21:23.182]  As our saviors and we have to understand we are under the gun by predators.
[00:21:23.683 --> 00:21:27.026]  These really are evil people and I know I don't want to admit it.
[00:21:27.167 --> 00:21:28.088]  You don't want to admit it.
[00:21:28.608 --> 00:21:29.109]  My gosh.
[00:21:29.209 --> 00:21:34.415]  I've been really upset more than I ever been knowing all this to actually see the trap shut.
[00:21:36.243 --> 00:21:38.765]  It's like you're telling your kid, hey watch out, that's a bear trap over there.
[00:21:38.785 --> 00:21:39.326]  They don't listen.
[00:21:39.366 --> 00:21:42.048]  Step it and it clangs on their leg and almost chops it off.
[00:21:42.068 --> 00:21:43.269]  You're trying to get the bear trap off.
[00:21:43.469 --> 00:21:47.333]  Do you feel good that you were right and your six-year-old walked over and stepped in the bear trap?
[00:21:47.373 --> 00:21:52.077]  No, you're not happy that the damn thing shut on our collective leg.
[00:21:53.638 --> 00:21:54.259]  But it did.
[00:21:54.379 --> 00:22:01.005]  Now we got the bear trap on our leg and CNN's telling you it's mama giving you a kiss on the cheek and it ain't.
[00:22:02.577 --> 00:22:06.242]  And so people better get pissed, and we better get this damn thing off our leg.
[00:22:06.482 --> 00:22:08.545]  And let me tell you, it's gonna hurt.
[00:22:10.347 --> 00:22:12.650]  But you know what the bear trap's for, right?
[00:22:12.770 --> 00:22:13.932]  It's to hold you down.
[00:22:16.869 --> 00:22:21.935]  So that when they come to kill the bear, you can't get away.
[00:22:22.355 --> 00:22:24.237]  You're being put on lockdown.
[00:22:24.657 --> 00:22:26.239]  You're being put on house arrest.
[00:22:26.459 --> 00:22:27.581]  I'm being put on lockdown.
[00:22:27.861 --> 00:22:29.142]  You're being held hostage.
[00:22:29.443 --> 00:22:30.844]  You're getting bitch slapped.
[00:22:31.144 --> 00:22:33.968]  You're getting taught who your daddy is.
[00:22:35.523 --> 00:22:39.407]  You're getting taught that all the tracking stuff they already had in place is something you got to accept.
[00:22:39.627 --> 00:22:43.030]  And you're getting told that all these unemployed people are going to be new snitches.
[00:22:43.590 --> 00:22:48.234]  Oh, in this new international program that the UN runs with the health services.
[00:22:49.415 --> 00:22:50.857]  Becoming the global government.
[00:22:52.238 --> 00:22:56.782]  If Hitler came in lab coats, we'd have laid down to him and said, yes sir, Heil Hitler.
[00:22:57.563 --> 00:22:59.785]  If he wore a pink uniform, we would have bowed to him.
[00:22:59.805 --> 00:23:00.445]  But he didn't.
[00:23:00.485 --> 00:23:01.907]  He came with tanks and airplanes.
[00:23:03.174 --> 00:23:05.055]  And so we said, oh, you're going to kick our ass?
[00:23:05.315 --> 00:23:06.456]  We'll kick your ass!
[00:23:07.057 --> 00:23:08.317]  Because it was out in the open.
[00:23:09.838 --> 00:23:16.643]  But if he'd have been a convicted pedophile and said, I just want to love your children and groom them, and the school said so, you'd sit right on Hitler's lap.
[00:23:17.444 --> 00:23:17.744]  Wouldn't you?
[00:23:18.084 --> 00:23:19.845]  Because we've all been tested and prepared.
[00:23:20.025 --> 00:23:27.190]  And when they said, look, they'll even let convicted pedophiles have their way with their children on TV and literally hump kids on TV, they said, then launch the attack.
[00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:29.231]  These people will put up with anything.
[00:23:29.251 --> 00:23:31.013]  And they're going to take everything you've got.
[00:23:31.173 --> 00:23:32.874]  Submission to this is death.
[00:23:34.642 --> 00:23:35.502]  It's humiliation.
[00:23:35.562 --> 00:23:36.083]  It's slavery.
[00:23:36.143 --> 00:23:37.764]  It's everything under the sun.

[00:23:41.485 --> 00:23:43.046]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:23:43.366 --> 00:23:44.827]  Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:23:45.387 --> 00:23:46.508]  You are the Paul Reveres.
[00:23:46.568 --> 00:23:48.489]  However you're listening, tell folks to tune in now.
[00:23:48.909 --> 00:23:50.770]  Now you are the resistance.
[00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:55.753]  Well, if you want to be free, you should run away from submission.
[00:23:56.573 --> 00:24:02.256]  You should fight back in any way you can because submission to the whole COVID-19 Bill and Melinda Gates U.N.
[00:24:02.356 --> 00:24:05.017]  rollout is the end of human freedom as we know it.
[00:24:07.058 --> 00:24:07.418]  All right.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:11.200]  Let me do this.
[00:24:12.721 --> 00:24:17.403]  Let me show you the face of true fascism and true authoritarianism.
[00:24:17.884 --> 00:24:20.445]  This is footage from this weekend out of Staten Island, New York.
[00:24:22.073 --> 00:24:26.275]  Where a woman is not wearing her burka mask of submission.
[00:24:27.556 --> 00:24:32.918]  And so a mob of men and women begin screaming and cussing at her and run her out of the store.
[00:24:33.558 --> 00:24:38.841]  Leftist on Twitter celebrated it and said she deserved to be beaten in the head because she is a criminal.
[00:24:38.901 --> 00:24:40.021]  She's a potential carrier.
[00:24:40.341 --> 00:24:41.202]  She's a murderer.
[00:24:41.262 --> 00:24:43.203]  You know, we're all suspects now.
[00:24:43.523 --> 00:24:47.925]  We're all guilty until vaccinated however many times Bill Gates wants.
[00:24:49.036 --> 00:24:52.198]  We're all guilty until sterilized, not innocent until proven guilty.
[00:24:52.538 --> 00:24:55.119]  Guilty until vaccinated, until dead.
[00:24:55.139 --> 00:24:56.360]  Here's that video.
[00:24:58.521 --> 00:24:59.562]  Get out!
[00:24:59.782 --> 00:25:00.782]  Get out!
[00:25:20.314 --> 00:25:26.419]  And so you got full-grown men thugging out, strutting around, yelling at a woman.
[00:25:29.922 --> 00:25:41.233]  And again, that's New York run by criminals so hardcore that they have more deaths than any other large grouping of states combined because it's all fraud.
[00:25:42.674 --> 00:25:43.355]  But it gets worse.
[00:25:45.589 --> 00:25:47.070]  We're going to play this footage here in a moment.
[00:25:47.191 --> 00:25:47.591]  Update.
[00:25:47.751 --> 00:25:56.219]  Black man caught on video beating elderly nursing home patient was arrested after hero Tom Fenton from Judicial Watch alerts authorities.
[00:25:58.181 --> 00:26:04.287]  It has to be a national watchdog that even cares to go find out and do something.
[00:26:04.347 --> 00:26:09.072]  And it turns out that individual that was there beating up the old people, we're going to play it with audio here in a moment.
[00:26:11.587 --> 00:26:15.609]  He was put there because he tested positive for COVID-19.
[00:26:15.989 --> 00:26:29.037]  He was asymptomatic, got tested, and sent as a cash cow welfare bonanza, reportedly by his family, and didn't even work in the facility.
[00:26:29.057 --> 00:26:32.219]  Now think about that.
[00:26:32.599 --> 00:26:36.181]  You have COVID-19, and so you send people, young people,
[00:26:37.364 --> 00:26:39.925]  Into a nursing home to then infect them.
[00:26:39.985 --> 00:26:41.326]  And this is another Democrat plan.
[00:26:41.766 --> 00:26:46.388]  Because if you've got almost dead people, and you give them pneumonia, you can up that number.
[00:26:47.989 --> 00:26:49.810]  And then they get to intubate everybody.
[00:26:50.651 --> 00:27:03.357]  And so that's why in New York, in Michigan, in California, in Oregon, in Washington State, in Minnesota, all the Democrat rat nests, New Jersey,
[00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:12.755]  They're on record shipping young people into nursing homes and saying nursing homes are where COVID patients go.
[00:27:13.976 --> 00:27:15.457]  Meanwhile, the hospitals are empty!
[00:27:16.377 --> 00:27:18.799]  And the heroes at the nursing homes!
[00:27:18.819 --> 00:27:21.961]  One of the most abusive industries on record.
[00:27:22.001 --> 00:27:22.781]  Some are good, some are bad.
[00:27:22.801 --> 00:27:25.903]  I know folks that have worked at nursing homes, physical therapists that are wonderful angels.
[00:27:26.164 --> 00:27:28.265]  There are plenty of evil people in there, as everybody knows.
[00:27:28.465 --> 00:27:29.566]  You get very callous in there.
[00:27:30.902 --> 00:27:37.444]  And so, oh, if the whole nursing home gets COVID-19, that's 13,000 smackers per person.
[00:27:37.524 --> 00:27:48.188]  And then, whoo, lordy, lordy, lordy, when a bunch of the Alzheimer's patients that are 90 years old on average, when they get that COVID, they said, the UN set the standards.
[00:27:48.568 --> 00:27:52.070]  Snake a tube down their throat, intubate them, 39,000 sweetsies.
[00:27:57.483 --> 00:28:00.806]  But you got to put the poison in.
[00:28:01.667 --> 00:28:19.563]  So, it's hard to get people already in nursing homes sick, so you find people in the community that have it, you get them tested, and then you ship that weapon like the British troops give the Native Americans smallpox blankets that had smallpox on it, you just give it to them.
[00:28:19.903 --> 00:28:22.305]  And then you get all that cash!
[00:28:23.346 --> 00:28:26.830]  And it doesn't matter if it's Europe, it doesn't matter if it's the United States, it doesn't matter if it's Australia.
[00:28:27.090 --> 00:28:35.278]  The UN set the scam, the big insurance actuaries, and they paid it all out and they're running that like a football play right up the middle on us.
[00:28:39.903 --> 00:28:46.990]  And now... They're within striking distance of a major touchdown.
[00:28:48.615 --> 00:29:00.701]  Because everybody wants to be genteel and it's a form of elegance and a form of manliness and a form of heroicness to wear the mask and stand back and get all scared and talk about how we lived through it, we survived it.
[00:29:02.582 --> 00:29:14.748]  And meanwhile, a giant criminal conspiracy, actuary, prepared, battle-planned, scripted, blueprinted, war-gamed, was set up at the UN years ago
[00:29:17.196 --> 00:29:28.285]  WarGamed again last October and November with Bill and Melinda Gates captaining it, generaling it, field marshalling it, and then they launched the whole giant sickening enchilada.
[00:29:28.585 --> 00:29:34.050]  And even USA Today did a fact check a month ago and said, it's actually true.
[00:29:35.711 --> 00:29:41.015]  They get $13,000 and $39,000 and then a bunch of other money for the COVID patients.
[00:29:41.035 --> 00:29:43.918]  In fact, can we put that USA Today back on screen for the viewers?
[00:29:43.958 --> 00:29:46.780]  Just check them to the bottom where it says claim is true.
[00:29:50.899 --> 00:29:51.660]  Just go to the bottom.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:52.360]  That's right.
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:53.080]  A little bit quicker.
[00:29:54.221 --> 00:29:57.303]  We'll just mosey on down that little juicy down there for ya.
[00:29:58.944 --> 00:29:59.685]  It's down at the bottom.
[00:30:00.125 --> 00:30:00.786]  Alrighty then.
[00:30:01.506 --> 00:30:07.350]  As Ace Ventura would say, their ruling is true.
[00:30:07.370 --> 00:30:09.912]  They're even rubbing it in, see.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:16.582]  Rubbing it into your faces, enjoying themselves, oh, it's so much fun to scam everyone.
[00:30:17.182 --> 00:30:33.608]  Then say that people like me, that say vitamin D3 and zinc and vitamin C are essential, and that if you don't have those, the virus can get in and replicate, and that's why people starving to death all the time die of the common cold, and that's all scientific, historic, absolute fact!
[00:30:35.851 --> 00:30:40.674]  And they're calling for my arrest all over the news, and everybody else's arrest, and they're SWAT teaming with guys with MP5s.
[00:30:40.694 --> 00:30:41.075]  Get in!
[00:30:41.235 --> 00:30:41.655]  Get in!
[00:30:41.695 --> 00:30:45.658]  It's like doctor's facilities where they're giving people vitamin C. You piece of filth!
[00:30:46.358 --> 00:30:47.659]  Vitamin C crappy American!
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:48.100]  Get on!
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.524]  They're like, how dare the president tell people hydroxychloroquine and zinc!
[00:30:54.244 --> 00:30:58.407]  And Z-Pack, it's doctors all over the world, 100% success rate.
[00:30:58.827 --> 00:31:00.529]  On record, shut up Trump!
[00:31:00.849 --> 00:31:01.449]  Shut up!
[00:31:01.709 --> 00:31:02.250]  Shut up!
[00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:03.070]  Shut up!
[00:31:03.391 --> 00:31:03.911]  Shut up!
[00:31:04.211 --> 00:31:04.712]  Shut up!
[00:31:05.032 --> 00:31:05.512]  Shut up!
[00:31:05.812 --> 00:31:06.373]  Shut up!
[00:31:08.915 --> 00:31:15.780]  Because we're going to put an engineered cold virus out that we own.
[00:31:17.352 --> 00:31:29.041]  And we're gonna kill a bunch of people and a bunch of other people that didn't die that died in car wrecks and gunshot wounds and stabbings and cancer and heart attacks and dog bites.
[00:31:32.203 --> 00:31:35.205]  We're gonna count them all as COVID-19, baby.
[00:31:36.086 --> 00:31:36.766]  Look at these articles.
[00:31:37.747 --> 00:31:41.830]  Gunshot victims count as coronavirus deaths in Washington State.
[00:31:43.268 --> 00:31:48.812]  Sixth name on New York Times list of coronavirus victims is 27-year-old man who was murdered!
[00:31:48.832 --> 00:31:52.155]  Then you go deeper and the whole list is just full of people.
[00:31:52.675 --> 00:32:00.562]  I mean, they'll put you on the list if you died in a car wreck or a gunshot wound.
[00:32:00.582 --> 00:32:01.182]  And here's another one.
[00:32:01.522 --> 00:32:03.924]  Gunshot victims count as coronavirus death in Washington state.
[00:32:04.064 --> 00:32:05.165]  This is just today's news.
[00:32:05.766 --> 00:32:06.987]  Imperial College said 500,000 died.
[00:32:07.007 --> 00:32:07.667]  Nothing even near it.
[00:32:12.383 --> 00:32:14.024]  They said two plus million in the U.S.
[00:32:14.104 --> 00:32:14.845]  Nothing even near it.
[00:32:14.905 --> 00:32:16.226]  And all of that is salted.
[00:32:16.706 --> 00:32:18.007]  All of that is filled with crap.
[00:32:18.488 --> 00:32:19.548]  All of that is lies.
[00:32:19.669 --> 00:32:25.133]  And the very criminals that run the Wuhan lab and Obama and Fauci, it's their next coup.
[00:32:25.413 --> 00:32:26.334]  Russiagate didn't work.
[00:32:27.102 --> 00:32:28.143]  Ukrainegate didn't work.
[00:32:28.243 --> 00:32:29.184]  Race war didn't work.
[00:32:29.925 --> 00:32:32.026]  Crash the economy, though, they think it worked.
[00:32:32.447 --> 00:32:39.733]  And that's what they're betting on, and Bernie Sanders and Biden are all saying it's Trump's fault, when they're the ones that ran the whole damn show.
[00:32:39.773 --> 00:32:40.194]  And you know what?
[00:32:40.234 --> 00:32:42.816]  If we're stupid enough to go along with this and not spread the word, then we deserve it.
[00:32:42.996 --> 00:32:43.677]  Here's the bad news.
[00:32:44.077 --> 00:32:44.498]  We come back.
[00:32:45.298 --> 00:32:45.879]  Here's some good news.
[00:32:46.459 --> 00:32:47.020]  People are waking up.
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.862]  The bad news is... The bad news is...
[00:32:51.084 --> 00:32:52.245]  The AI is now in place.
[00:32:53.105 --> 00:32:55.046]  And I've got the reports flooding in all confirmed.
[00:32:55.066 --> 00:32:58.428]  In fact, I got another one just a minute ago, a well-known national talk show host sent me.
[00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:02.211]  That I need to remind the crew to get pulled up.
[00:33:03.011 --> 00:33:03.631]  This is unbelievable.
[00:33:03.651 --> 00:33:06.273]  When we come back, the bad news, because that means we can beat them though.
[00:33:06.313 --> 00:33:07.394]  We got to admit to the bad.
[00:33:08.034 --> 00:33:09.215]  Don't know how to whoop its ass.
[00:33:09.235 --> 00:33:09.795]  We'll be right back.
[00:33:12.277 --> 00:33:12.537]  All right.
[00:33:12.597 --> 00:33:17.860]  We are back live and I'm really doing my best here, not going into a rage on air because
[00:33:22.236 --> 00:33:26.757]  How we treat old people, and how we treat children, and how we treat babies, is who we are.
[00:33:28.458 --> 00:33:35.660]  And, um... I have confirmed, it's public, it's all over the damn news!
[00:33:37.061 --> 00:33:40.542]  But we knew this a few months ago, and Media Matters made jokes about it.
[00:33:40.602 --> 00:33:44.243]  Oh, Jones claims they're killing old people in the nursing homes, bringing in COVID patients on purpose.
[00:33:44.803 --> 00:33:49.845]  Think about your default being covering up evil, and liking it, and thinking it's cute and funny.
[00:33:51.769 --> 00:33:54.191]  And Bill Gates up there about, yeah, we gotta get rid of the old people.
[00:33:55.852 --> 00:34:02.736]  Oh, you didn't get rid of your 95-year-old dad you got in a nursing home that's got some private palace?
[00:34:04.998 --> 00:34:06.819]  Oh, that useful senior, he didn't go anywhere.
[00:34:10.622 --> 00:34:14.705]  You better believe they're not taking COVID-19 patients and sticking it next to Bill Gates Sr.
[00:34:20.014 --> 00:34:34.737]  And when you study evil, how these big corporations sit there like bean counters and figure out a whole plan, they go to these big global councils, they all vote and decide on what the best scam is, that helps all of their organizations, and you got COVID-19.
[00:34:35.237 --> 00:34:49.200]  Because it helps the global government, the digital tattoo, the surveillance state, the tattletale state, the medical tyranny, the forced inoculations, the global government, so the UN runs it, I mean,
[00:34:50.518 --> 00:34:58.221]  I turn on local news, radio, TV, newspaper, it is just, the UN is beyond platinum, man.
[00:34:58.241 --> 00:35:03.943]  I used to hear the Pope spoke from the throne, ex-cathedra.
[00:35:04.583 --> 00:35:11.385]  Well, when it comes out of the mouth of the WHO, man, it's like it came out of Jesus' mouth, according to these people.
[00:35:16.294 --> 00:35:25.420]  And then everything that comes out of their mouth is a corrupt, lying fraud, allied with the most murderous regimes the planet has ever seen!
[00:35:27.941 --> 00:35:32.364]  And man, I mean, I look at that governor up there that on purpose sends people infected to nursing homes.
[00:35:32.384 --> 00:35:34.966]  I mean, that's like the default thing you don't do.
[00:35:34.986 --> 00:35:38.288]  Like, don't throw a newborn baby in the deep end of the pool.
[00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:41.290]  And she's got the baby, throwing it right in the pool.
[00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:44.552]  It's like, don't go in a fireworks factory with a flamethrower lit.
[00:35:45.529 --> 00:35:47.352]  Or don't pour gasoline on yourself and light it!
[00:35:48.674 --> 00:35:51.218]  Don't jump in the backyard with 15 starving pit bulls!
[00:35:51.539 --> 00:35:54.624]  Don't go to the local zoo and climb in the Bengal tiger cage!
[00:35:55.478 --> 00:35:57.739]  I mean, don't take a bottle of cyanide!
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.760]  Don't chop your dick off!
[00:36:00.021 --> 00:36:03.042]  Excuse me, but this is ridiculous!
[00:36:03.923 --> 00:36:19.472]  The default position is keep infectious patients away from the nursing homes and Democrats in unison and globalists from Europe to Australia to the United States, ship them in there to call their asses!
[00:36:22.523 --> 00:36:24.545]  Bunch of murderin' scum!
[00:36:24.885 --> 00:36:26.226]  Seein' what they can get away with.
[00:36:26.447 --> 00:36:27.848]  You're like, well maybe they're just stupid.
[00:36:28.348 --> 00:36:31.171]  That's why they run their mouth about killin' old people all day!
[00:36:31.952 --> 00:36:33.913]  They don't wanna just kill those old people!
[00:36:34.074 --> 00:36:35.475]  They wanna kill everybody!
[00:36:35.495 --> 00:36:39.859]  And I'm not gonna sit here and take it!
[00:36:41.921 --> 00:36:42.681]  So I've been pissed.
[00:36:43.752 --> 00:36:46.953]  I've been really pissed behind the scenes because I hadn't been really telling you what I really think.
[00:36:47.173 --> 00:36:48.533]  These people are murdering us.
[00:36:49.214 --> 00:36:57.816]  And I tell you, we sit there and put up with them killing these unborn babies and these little kids and keeping these babies alive and taking their organs and killing all these old people!
[00:37:00.197 --> 00:37:02.938]  We deserve whatever the hell we get.
[00:37:03.018 --> 00:37:04.498]  And let me tell you, we're going to get it.
[00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:09.500]  But man, I look at the eyes of that governor.
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:11.541]  That woman's the most evil looking person.
[00:37:11.561 --> 00:37:12.741]  She's more evil looking than Hillary Clinton.
[00:37:14.189 --> 00:37:18.091]  People say, I mean, if you have any discernment, you see the evil.
[00:37:18.352 --> 00:37:21.293]  Some people go, watch Jones C and Brian Stelter that looks evil.
[00:37:21.934 --> 00:37:22.594]  Are you joking?
[00:37:22.814 --> 00:37:27.898]  Pull up the governor of Michigan, just a random photo of her on screen with those crazy eyes.
[00:37:27.918 --> 00:37:29.839]  You watch her, you think, oh, that's just a crazy photo.
[00:37:30.259 --> 00:37:31.440]  Every video she's in.
[00:37:37.745 --> 00:37:38.725]  I mean, look at her!
[00:37:38.825 --> 00:37:39.866]  My God!
[00:37:40.366 --> 00:37:41.667]  And then it's Stelter!
[00:37:42.607 --> 00:37:45.008]  These are bad people!
[00:37:45.788 --> 00:37:47.289]  That's a murderer right there!
[00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:49.950]  That is a murderer!
[00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:54.592]  Now that is a disgusting... Oh, look at that boy!
[00:37:55.792 --> 00:37:56.413]  Look out!
[00:37:56.953 --> 00:37:57.793]  He's a-comin'!
[00:37:59.294 --> 00:37:59.894]  Woo!
[00:38:01.695 --> 00:38:02.095]  Man!
[00:38:03.339 --> 00:38:05.180]  That ought to run a chill up your spine.
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:06.240]  I don't know what does!
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:08.001]  Or you don't have any discernment!
[00:38:08.541 --> 00:38:12.143]  It's like in Lord of the Rings, Sting the Goblin Cleaver.
[00:38:12.183 --> 00:38:15.744]  That sucker lights up white-hot blue when goblins are around.
[00:38:16.085 --> 00:38:17.005]  Well, let me tell you.
[00:38:18.286 --> 00:38:21.867]  You can take one look at those people and lock up your kids, folks.
[00:38:22.307 --> 00:38:23.208]  Lock up your doors.
[00:38:24.048 --> 00:38:26.289]  And grab your ass with both hands, because they're coming for you.
[00:38:32.012 --> 00:38:32.832]  God help us, man.
[00:38:34.292 --> 00:38:36.074]  That's not human, folks, that's a demon!
[00:38:38.697 --> 00:38:40.198]  And I just get upset around these people.
[00:38:40.759 --> 00:38:41.539]  Oh, look at that!
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:43.501]  Look at that demon, boy!
[00:38:44.563 --> 00:38:45.223]  Woo!
[00:38:45.824 --> 00:38:47.546]  That's bad news right there!
[00:38:47.566 --> 00:38:53.512]  Ooh, look at that face!
[00:38:54.272 --> 00:38:55.193]  That is a predator!
[00:38:56.067 --> 00:39:02.290]  That wants to do one thing and she, or even when it came out two months ago, don't put sick people in the nursing homes.
[00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:05.291]  She said, we're sending the COVID patients to the nursing homes.
[00:39:05.991 --> 00:39:13.095]  Again, that's like, well, it's like sending disease into the most weak group.
[00:39:13.115 --> 00:39:14.095]  That's exactly what it is.
[00:39:14.235 --> 00:39:17.036]  I mean, it is, it is default.
[00:39:19.117 --> 00:39:20.538]  Don't stick your finger in a light socket.
[00:39:21.719 --> 00:39:22.379]  All right, I'm going to stop.
[00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:30.421]  They let all these articles come out and say that I'm making it up, that Bill and Melinda Gates financed a digital tattoo under the skin.
[00:39:30.441 --> 00:39:36.222]  And they try to apples and oranges it with another global ID they have that could be chips or bracelets or watches or phones.
[00:39:37.602 --> 00:39:42.243]  And they try to say it's not happening, but we actually have Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation people on video saying they're doing it.
[00:39:42.883 --> 00:39:44.403]  And we're just going to play that for you next hour.
[00:39:44.443 --> 00:39:46.724]  They open the phones up and Max Keiser and Paul Watson are coming on.
[00:39:47.864 --> 00:39:52.105]  So that's all coming up, but you know, it's just amazing how they play these damn games.
[00:39:53.544 --> 00:39:54.867]  Oh, nobody wants your guns.
[00:39:54.907 --> 00:39:56.590]  They just take your guns everywhere they get control.
[00:39:56.630 --> 00:39:58.433]  Now they're like, yeah, we want all your guns.
[00:39:58.453 --> 00:39:59.174]  We're going to take them all.
[00:39:59.915 --> 00:40:01.959]  And by the way, we're promoting pedophilia while we're at it.
[00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:14.842]  By the way, we're going to take people that have a really dangerous pneumonia, and we're going to stick them with old people, the number one target group that can kill them, so we can jack those death numbers up, and while we're doing it, we're going to get a big old piece of money off that.
[00:40:15.083 --> 00:40:23.471]  You know, some thug gangbanger goes and kills an old person in their house for $1,000 of jewelry, and man, we send their ass to the
[00:40:24.349 --> 00:40:24.989]  Death Chamber.
[00:40:25.189 --> 00:40:27.311]  We send them to the lethal injection and we should.
[00:40:27.671 --> 00:40:43.419]  But boy, when the government and those corporations and the Democrats roll up their sleeves and go to town on some old people to make 50-something thousand dollars off of everyone they murder, murder, murder, murder, murder, murder!
[00:40:43.599 --> 00:40:44.220]  Redrum!
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:45.040]  Redrum!
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:45.881]  Redrum!
[00:40:46.101 --> 00:40:46.661]  Redrum!
[00:40:46.801 --> 00:40:50.183]  They're murdering us and we just sit here and we put up with it!
[00:40:58.143 --> 00:40:58.963]  Get your ass!
[00:40:59.963 --> 00:41:01.044]  What's wrong with people?
[00:41:02.964 --> 00:41:07.725]  They're killing people all over the damn country, hundreds of them a day, to jack their numbers up.
[00:41:07.985 --> 00:41:09.685]  These people aren't a political party.
[00:41:09.865 --> 00:41:22.868]  They're a group of satanic demons who've promoted worse and worse people into power positions, where you now watch a Democrat event and men, women, black, white, old, young, they're all... I mean, they're like...
[00:41:23.962 --> 00:41:26.863]  A movie where gremlins attack and they all run out with evil guns.
[00:41:27.844 --> 00:41:29.104]  And you're like, this is ridiculous.
[00:41:34.126 --> 00:41:36.047]  So, I don't like being under them.
[00:41:36.447 --> 00:41:37.467]  I don't like being their slave.
[00:41:37.487 --> 00:41:40.308]  And let's just say it, we're all caught in their thing right now.
[00:41:41.029 --> 00:41:41.509]  I don't like it.
[00:41:42.609 --> 00:41:47.391]  I don't like the fact that they're, these Lilliputians are tying me down and tying you down.
[00:41:48.832 --> 00:41:49.572]  Right now!
[00:41:51.274 --> 00:41:53.216]  They are tying you down!
[00:41:53.497 --> 00:41:54.778]  And they think it's funny!
[00:41:55.459 --> 00:41:57.942]  Well, I don't think it's funny, and I'm gonna break free!
[00:41:57.962 --> 00:42:00.966]  And I need you to break free with me.
[00:42:00.986 --> 00:42:02.447]  I'm gonna go to break.
[00:42:02.507 --> 00:42:02.968]  I got a plug.
[00:42:02.988 --> 00:42:03.529]  We won't be here.
[00:42:07.093 --> 00:42:09.175]  We've got this, uh, special running.
[00:42:10.543 --> 00:42:12.244]  Memorial Day Special!
[00:42:12.304 --> 00:42:14.225]  And it's a lot of great products, and you need it.
[00:42:14.925 --> 00:42:18.147]  These are all things these murdering trash don't want you to know are essential.
[00:42:18.447 --> 00:42:20.488]  These murdering pieces of maggot filth.
[00:42:20.828 --> 00:42:23.209]  They don't want you to get DNA Force Plus, 50% off.
[00:42:23.729 --> 00:42:24.710]  Vaso Beaks, 50% off.
[00:42:24.730 --> 00:42:25.090]  X2, 50% off.
[00:42:25.130 --> 00:42:25.710]  Turbo Force, 50% off.
[00:42:25.730 --> 00:42:26.430]  Ultimate Krell Oil, 50% off.
[00:42:26.671 --> 00:42:27.631]  Survival Shield X3, 60% off.
[00:42:27.651 --> 00:42:28.591]  Living Defense, 50% off.
[00:42:28.932 --> 00:42:29.352]  Knockout, 50% off.
[00:42:39.758 --> 00:42:44.642]  Rainforest Plus is our number one most popular product from units sold.
[00:42:44.662 --> 00:42:48.404]  We don't make much money on it because it's low price, but it's high quality.
[00:42:52.267 --> 00:42:53.308]  You hear me, globalists?
[00:42:54.228 --> 00:42:58.452]  I know you're already murdering everybody and you think it's funny, but you're going to get your asses handed to you.
[00:42:58.472 --> 00:43:02.595]  I can feel the death and the evil!
[00:43:02.655 --> 00:43:04.056]  It makes me sick!
[00:43:04.996 --> 00:43:05.957]  I can feel it!
[00:43:05.997 --> 00:43:06.778]  Can't you feel it?
[00:43:07.759 --> 00:43:12.002]  Enough to kill all the little babies, now they gotta kill grandma and beat the brains out!
[00:43:12.883 --> 00:43:15.245]  Stick a fork in them and suck a bunch of money out of us!
[00:43:16.466 --> 00:43:23.791]  And we're just gonna sit here and let that governor piss all over us, squat down that witch, get down on our knees and piss right in our face.
[00:43:24.031 --> 00:43:27.674]  We're gonna say, oh, thank you, you big, ugly, stinking murderer!
[00:43:28.074 --> 00:43:32.898]  Oh, you big, fat-ass piece of, oh, thank you for destroying all these people!
[00:43:32.938 --> 00:43:34.399]  We love you, you maggot!
[00:43:35.373 --> 00:43:41.495]  Thank you for saving us, you hero, from Bill Gates' COVID-19, you fat, swollen wart!
[00:43:43.056 --> 00:43:44.016]  See, maybe I shouldn't be on air.
[00:43:44.036 --> 00:43:46.657]  This is what I really feel like, who I really am!
[00:43:46.677 --> 00:43:54.220]  Alright, folks, I've been wanting to release that for about two months on air, and I just went ahead and... went ahead and was honest with you.
[00:43:56.721 --> 00:43:57.821]  We're being suffocated.
[00:43:57.841 --> 00:43:58.822]  We're being strangled.
[00:44:00.126 --> 00:44:01.167]  And we're being killed.
[00:44:01.968 --> 00:44:04.509]  And these people are just getting away with stuff never foreseen.
[00:44:04.570 --> 00:44:05.330]  It's their wish list.
[00:44:05.951 --> 00:44:07.532]  It's a giant bioethics test.
[00:44:09.042 --> 00:44:11.323]  To see what they can get hospital workers and the public to go along with.
[00:44:11.743 --> 00:44:14.804]  It's the hospital workers that are the most awake group out there I've seen.
[00:44:15.144 --> 00:44:15.944]  They're like, we're empty.
[00:44:16.324 --> 00:44:18.765]  We're told to put people that didn't die of COVID on the COVID list.
[00:44:18.785 --> 00:44:19.545]  We get a bunch of money.
[00:44:19.845 --> 00:44:22.126]  We're all getting bonuses, but we're told to shut our mouths.
[00:44:22.686 --> 00:44:28.288]  I could open the phones up right now and take medical worker after medical worker after medical worker.
[00:44:28.308 --> 00:44:29.649]  But see, the globalists are smart.
[00:44:29.669 --> 00:44:32.630]  They go, oh, you don't like the medical workers.
[00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:33.370]  They're heroes.
[00:44:33.450 --> 00:44:35.771]  Well, on an average day, EMTs,
[00:44:37.646 --> 00:44:42.169]  Uh, trauma nurses, you name it, it's a tough job and they are hard working folks.
[00:44:43.129 --> 00:44:49.694]  Make no damn mistake, I watched my dad just doing oral surgery and dentistry half kill himself with all those patients and how stressful that work was.
[00:44:50.734 --> 00:44:56.798]  That's nothing compared to EMTs and people and police that see, you know, kids dead and car wrecks and stuff.
[00:44:56.818 --> 00:44:58.019]  That'll change you forever.
[00:44:58.259 --> 00:45:03.162]  Nobody said there weren't heroes in the medical system, but there's an evil system taking it over.
[00:45:04.738 --> 00:45:10.580]  And there's this decision that old people don't have value, so let's just kill them, snake a tube down their throat.
[00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.302]  No one is going to kill them because you're being paid to slowly murder them.
[00:45:16.583 --> 00:45:18.564]  But so they test positive for COVID-19.
[00:45:19.804 --> 00:45:20.545]  Let's play this video.
[00:45:21.105 --> 00:45:28.688]  They put individuals in there who was a patient put there by the governor of Michigan.
[00:45:30.558 --> 00:45:48.566]  Because that's what you're supposed to do with a 20-year-old individual who's not even sick, is sticking in with the old people so that Jaden Hayden can be another patient they make money off of.
[00:45:48.606 --> 00:45:48.986]  Here it is.
[00:46:10.902 --> 00:46:16.064]  So that is not a nurse, that is a patient put in there by the governor.
[00:46:16.104 --> 00:46:17.905]  And by the way, it's on record, the governor ordered this.
[00:46:20.326 --> 00:46:29.450]  Mentally ill people, the guy's obviously completely mentally ill, beating the living snot out of old people, choking old women, punching old women in the throat.
[00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:30.210]  This is an old man.
[00:46:32.751 --> 00:46:34.652]  And then he posts this as his black supremacy.
[00:46:38.379 --> 00:46:41.683]  I mean, this is absolute mental illness.
[00:46:42.825 --> 00:46:47.350]  But you know that if it had been a white person doing that, they'd have said, oh, this is what white people do.
[00:46:48.912 --> 00:46:54.600]  But when this guy does it, we go, oh, he's mentally ill, because the guy's completely stark raving lunatic.
[00:46:54.940 --> 00:46:55.941]  Probably has about an ADIQ.
[00:46:57.210 --> 00:46:58.231]  Probably from vaccines.
[00:46:58.871 --> 00:47:00.212]  But that part doesn't matter.
[00:47:00.532 --> 00:47:12.641]  The point is, is that they put a homicidal crazy person in a nursing home where he ran around for weeks posting videos of him drugging people, beating people, punching old women in the throat.
[00:47:17.604 --> 00:47:19.365]  This guy's not going to do too well in prison.
[00:47:20.046 --> 00:47:22.087]  And you know, I don't take any pleasure in that either.
[00:47:22.327 --> 00:47:24.389]  There's so many mentally ill, sick people out there.
[00:47:24.649 --> 00:47:25.590]  But let me tell you who's guilty.
[00:47:26.658 --> 00:47:29.760]  All of us for allowing this type of crap to go on.
[00:47:30.601 --> 00:47:35.444]  That came out like a week ago and no one was even going to find out who it was until Judicial Watch went and filed a deal to find out.
[00:47:35.904 --> 00:47:36.925]  Because no one even cares!
[00:47:36.945 --> 00:47:38.666]  I mean, hell, I guess I didn't care!
[00:47:38.686 --> 00:47:40.567]  I mean, I thought somebody else would do it, right?
[00:47:40.587 --> 00:47:42.448]  Everybody's like, oh, somebody else!
[00:47:44.970 --> 00:47:54.376]  You had Detroit lawmaker critical of Governor Whitmer's nursing home executive order to put
[00:47:56.428 --> 00:48:05.395]  Sick people as COVID-19 response hubs, main treatment centers for people that aren't even from the nursing home.
[00:48:08.458 --> 00:48:09.539]  That's why I went crazy.
[00:48:09.639 --> 00:48:11.620]  I mean, because, because I already know all this.
[00:48:11.661 --> 00:48:14.223]  You already know this, but when it hits you that, print me that article, please.
[00:48:14.663 --> 00:48:18.446]  When it hits you that they did all this premeditatedly going, well, this is just pneumonia.
[00:48:18.646 --> 00:48:20.708]  Well, let's kill off a bunch of these old people and get rich.
[00:48:21.929 --> 00:48:22.649]  I'm a woman though.
[00:48:22.669 --> 00:48:23.150]  It's okay.
[00:48:23.190 --> 00:48:24.071]  I'm a woman governor.
[00:48:24.850 --> 00:48:31.856]  Okay, you turn on any national news story and you'll see articles going, it's insane.
[00:48:32.556 --> 00:48:34.518]  Bill Gates is a perfect little angel keg.
[00:48:35.158 --> 00:48:36.659]  He never wanted to get rid of old people.
[00:48:36.699 --> 00:48:38.201]  He never wanted to euthanize anybody.
[00:48:38.501 --> 00:48:40.102]  He never wanted to depopulate Africa.
[00:48:40.643 --> 00:48:41.924]  He never wanted to do anything.
[00:48:41.964 --> 00:48:50.610]  He never had vaccine problems with people getting killed from his vaccines, even though you can find all the mainstream articles and all the reports and all the admissions going back for over 20 years.
[00:48:52.526 --> 00:48:56.790]  And Bill Gates' dad running Planned Parenthood and Bill Gates saying there's too many people, we need to depopulate the planet.
[00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:58.412]  His main focus being Africa.
[00:48:58.592 --> 00:48:59.633]  That's the London Guardian headline.
[00:49:00.253 --> 00:49:03.356]  Bill Gates is really worried about Africa's overpopulation.
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:09.422]  And then it's like, oh well, we just, you know, get rid of people.
[00:49:09.442 --> 00:49:10.043]  That's what we do.
[00:49:11.305 --> 00:49:17.930]  Then, oh, but if a white person shoots a black person, questionably, sure, we should cover it, but it's like the end of the world.
[00:49:17.970 --> 00:49:20.853]  Tonight, the evil whites are trying to kill the black people.
[00:49:21.693 --> 00:49:22.754]  And who are the evil whites?
[00:49:23.835 --> 00:49:24.956]  They're those gun owners.
[00:49:25.597 --> 00:49:25.977]  Yeah.
[00:49:27.298 --> 00:49:29.740]  We need to take the guns from the white supremacists.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:33.243]  Meanwhile, the real gun is a tainted inoculation.
[00:49:33.923 --> 00:49:35.765]  The real gun is a global depression.
[00:49:36.506 --> 00:49:39.268]  The real gun is not developing a third world and educating people.
[00:49:40.489 --> 00:49:44.030]  That's the gun pointed at them, and then the globalists are totally Malthusian.
[00:49:44.050 --> 00:49:45.190]  They use the gun against us.
[00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:49.491]  They collapse the third world and use it against us, and they admit that's their plan.
[00:49:49.551 --> 00:49:54.912]  So, there are all these articles out there about, oh, Bill Gates doesn't want to do anything.
[00:49:55.332 --> 00:49:55.552]  Why?
[00:49:55.892 --> 00:49:59.593]  Yes, he's got a patent, 2020-06-06-06.
[00:49:59.953 --> 00:50:02.494]  That's a global cryptocurrency for you to buy and sell.
[00:50:04.074 --> 00:50:08.055]  And it's a wristwatch or a phone or an app or a tattoo or a chip.
[00:50:08.962 --> 00:50:10.203]  Oh, but Jones says it's a chip.
[00:50:10.343 --> 00:50:21.611]  No, then he has another group he funded out of MIT that also has a digital tattoo, but it's a bunch of little, little, little spikes, little, little micro needles that then put it into your skin and break off in your skin.
[00:50:21.892 --> 00:50:25.014]  And then, and then you can't dig the chip out because it's a hundred little chips.
[00:50:25.594 --> 00:50:25.955]  Literally.
[00:50:26.315 --> 00:50:27.036]  You know, look at the patent.
[00:50:27.576 --> 00:50:30.698]  So, so this is, this is what they're funding.
[00:50:31.519 --> 00:50:32.680]  This is what they're doing.
[00:50:36.423 --> 00:50:37.964]  By the way folks, they always say I'm sweating on air.
[00:50:38.942 --> 00:50:41.764]  The rest of this office is like an icebox.
[00:50:42.445 --> 00:50:44.947]  The only room, no matter they can't ever cool, is the one I'm in.
[00:50:45.288 --> 00:50:45.988]  Which is fine with me.
[00:50:46.709 --> 00:50:53.615]  But with these big TVs behind me and these lights, it's about, you know, 85 degrees in here and I'm a big guy and I start sweating, which is fine because I'm real.
[00:50:53.635 --> 00:50:54.315]  I don't wear any makeup.
[00:50:54.335 --> 00:50:54.916]  That's how it is.
[00:50:54.956 --> 00:50:56.457]  But, you know, today the A.C.
[00:50:56.577 --> 00:50:58.159]  is not working properly such as the way that it is.
[00:50:58.179 --> 00:51:00.040]  You'll have to have me up here like an old priest.
[00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:00.761]  You're getting all sweaty.
[00:51:05.828 --> 00:51:07.529]  We're sitting here looking at all this.
[00:51:08.289 --> 00:51:10.651]  They always play this game like, oh, there's no global government.
[00:51:10.671 --> 00:51:11.851]  Well, you just said you want a global government.
[00:51:12.172 --> 00:51:14.473]  Oh, that's a different global government than the one you're talking about.
[00:51:16.594 --> 00:51:21.817]  So an invisible quantum dot tattoo could be used to ID vaccinated kids.
[00:51:21.857 --> 00:51:23.778]  And it turns out that's from Science Alert.
[00:51:23.858 --> 00:51:26.240]  That's being funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:51:27.335 --> 00:51:28.356]  That's mainstream news.
[00:51:29.136 --> 00:51:35.279]  Bill Gates, MIT developed tattoo ID to check for vaccinations, but they're saying doesn't exist.
[00:51:35.579 --> 00:51:37.240]  So you don't mount a resistance to it.
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:42.522]  And some of the time you're at the clinic or ever to get on the airplane or get a job, they're like, Oh, it's a new type of shot.
[00:51:42.842 --> 00:51:43.883]  It's just a little sticker.
[00:51:44.683 --> 00:51:45.844]  We just roll it across you.
[00:51:46.084 --> 00:51:49.025]  You get a rash because they're little micro needles.
[00:51:50.686 --> 00:51:53.667]  And so you put your arm in a machine, it goes, presses it down.
[00:51:54.328 --> 00:51:56.569]  The sticker comes back up, but now it's in your body.
[00:51:58.336 --> 00:51:59.136]  Did you hear what I just said?
[00:51:59.516 --> 00:52:00.677]  Little digital microchips.
[00:52:01.357 --> 00:52:05.178]  20 years ago, they could put all the books in the world on the head of a pen.
[00:52:06.398 --> 00:52:09.179]  Now they can put everything they want in one of those heads of a pen.
[00:52:09.539 --> 00:52:12.139]  And that's what this is, folks, into your body.
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:14.960]  Oh, they won't abuse that at all.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:16.440]  It's all unfolding.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.741]  And they've got the job of telling you everything's okay.
[00:52:19.301 --> 00:52:26.203]  So here's a clip from one of the Bill and Melinda Gates funded groups bragging about this digital tattoo.
[00:52:26.243 --> 00:52:26.523]  Here it is.
[00:52:28.877 --> 00:52:43.906]  In 2014, it was announced that Microchips Biotech, Inc., a company in Lexington, Massachusetts, had developed a new form of birth control, a wireless implant that can be turned on and off with a remote control and that is designed to last up to 16 years.
[00:52:45.207 --> 00:52:58.335]  According to MIT Technology Review, the idea originated when Bill Gates visited Robert Langer's MIT lab in 2012 and asked him if it would be possible to create an implantable birth control device that could be turned on or off remotely.
[00:52:59.505 --> 00:53:09.972]  Langer referred Gates to the controlled-release microchip technology he had invented and licensed to Microchips Biotechnology, and the Gates Foundation granted $20 million to the firm to develop the implants.
[00:53:11.874 --> 00:53:17.858]  Reducing population growth has, by Gates' own admission, been a core mission of the Gates Foundation since its inception.
[00:53:18.939 --> 00:53:26.984]  But in order to really understand what Gates means by population control, we have to look beyond the concept of controlling population size.
[00:53:28.246 --> 00:53:36.330]  At its most fundamental level, the population control the Gate speaks of is not birth control, but control of the population itself.
[00:53:37.371 --> 00:53:44.534]  The research, including Norplant, a contraceptive implanted under the skin of a woman's upper arm and effective for five years.
[00:53:45.435 --> 00:53:55.940]  In its 1988 report, the Rockefeller Foundation was pleased to announce that Norplant, which was developed by the Rockefeller-founded Population Council, was now approved for marketing in 12 countries.
[00:53:57.608 --> 00:54:07.555]  The Rockefeller's Population Council and other research organizations joined with the World Health Organization in 1972 to create a task force on vaccines for fertility regulation.
[00:54:08.616 --> 00:54:20.464]  By 1995, they were able to report progress in developing a... Now, we come back from the same piece that Corbett put out, titled Bill Gates' Human Control Grid.
[00:54:20.884 --> 00:54:22.786]  It actually shows MIT talking about how
[00:54:24.090 --> 00:54:26.192]  And now we've got this digital tattoo that just goes in.
[00:54:26.212 --> 00:54:27.633]  We did it for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[00:54:27.973 --> 00:54:30.194]  But that was a good primer for you.
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:41.404]  So that you could see how they're funding the implantable microchip movement directly, Bill and Melinda Gates, with the documents, with the Rockefeller Foundation, which again just handed its baton to Bill and Melinda Gates.
[00:54:42.124 --> 00:54:45.725]  Because the Rockefellers didn't find somebody as hard-working as Bill Gates to carry on.
[00:54:45.765 --> 00:54:53.648]  David Rockefeller handed the baton to him about 15 years ago, as best we can tell, and so he runs the whole enchilada, he runs the whole show.
[00:54:53.708 --> 00:54:56.149]  So we have that, and then the reason I was prefacing all of this
[00:54:56.829 --> 00:55:00.591]  A new article by Jamie White just went up on InfoWars.com.
[00:55:00.631 --> 00:55:03.332]  We have a five-minute video that deals with this.
[00:55:05.213 --> 00:55:06.594]  COVID Pass has come out.
[00:55:06.714 --> 00:55:10.116]  UK introduces digital health passport to monitor travel, health, and population.
[00:55:10.136 --> 00:55:11.577]  So China developed it with the globalists.
[00:55:11.817 --> 00:55:17.180]  They already had it ready on the shelf, and they talked about it in Event 201 last October, Bill and Melinda Gates did.
[00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:22.903]  And so now it's all being rolled out, how wonderful it is, how good it is, and how much you're going to enjoy all that.
[00:55:22.923 --> 00:55:24.824]  So we have that clip for you, and the key clip
[00:55:25.764 --> 00:55:34.246]  That is the video representation of them putting the chips into your body with them telling you that it does not exist.
[00:55:34.266 --> 00:55:34.946]  We're going to go to break.
[00:55:35.366 --> 00:55:47.249]  Please remember that the Memorial Day sale is going to go a couple more days and then it's going to have to end because we've already sold out of the previous sale, Pollen Block, Vitamineral Fusion, Bodies, and Ultra 12.
[00:55:47.409 --> 00:55:49.450]  Hopefully those will be back in soon.

[00:56:35.254 --> 00:56:40.767]  The guys don't tell me I gotta remember from memory here because I'm starting to become a senile person literally from too much knowledge is what's happening.
[00:56:41.348 --> 00:56:41.910]  We've got the...
[00:56:43.663 --> 00:56:49.388]  Peppermint, and then we've also got the lavender, and then we've also got the eucalyptus, and that's amazing.
[00:56:49.408 --> 00:56:51.851]  8-pack Power Stack is the best deal.

[00:56:54.453 --> 00:56:55.234]  There's a full spectrum.
[00:56:55.254 --> 00:56:57.076]  The very best deal we have.
[00:56:57.096 --> 00:56:57.276]  70% off.
[00:56:57.296 --> 00:56:59.778]  DNA Force Plus is the number one product I would take, other than X2.
[00:56:59.818 --> 00:57:00.979]  They're right up there together.
[00:57:01.019 --> 00:57:03.041]  They're both penultimate, but also numero uno.
[00:57:03.542 --> 00:57:05.263]  So they're both Segundo and Uno.
[00:57:06.384 --> 00:57:08.306]  DNA Force, plus 50% off.
[00:57:08.406 --> 00:57:10.187]  Living Defense, plus 50% off.
[00:57:10.508 --> 00:57:12.569]  Limited Edition, InfoWars face mask, $9.95.

[00:57:20.636 --> 00:57:22.818]  We can't go lower than that because it gets close to cost.
[00:57:23.238 --> 00:57:24.899]  And so much more at infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:29.482]  And yeah, I just am so pissed at these people attacking us and doing all this to us.
[00:57:29.542 --> 00:57:36.366]  And while they roll it all out, I mean, I told you years ago they'd have a global digital ID based on an outbreak because they were wargaming it and now it's all here.
[00:57:36.666 --> 00:57:40.027]  We'll have this amazing footage on the other side.
[00:57:40.408 --> 00:57:44.410]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.
[00:57:44.610 --> 00:57:51.173]  Only way this dog hunts is when you amazing people tell folks about the live feeds and the local stations you're listening to.
[00:57:51.233 --> 00:57:52.634]  So take action now!
[00:57:54.409 --> 00:57:55.689]  Survival of the fittest.
[00:57:56.890 --> 00:57:58.050]  The theory of species.
[00:57:58.130 --> 00:57:58.890]  Charles Darwin.
[00:57:58.910 --> 00:58:09.173]  It wasn't 50 years later, after he developed that in the 1850s, that they rolled out the theory of social Darwinism.
[00:58:11.534 --> 00:58:16.855]  Which is an excuse to do whatever you want to anybody, as long as you can get away with it.
[00:58:16.875 --> 00:58:20.316]  If you're gonna steal big, sons, steal super big.
[00:58:21.176 --> 00:58:22.917]  If you steal small, well...
[00:58:24.329 --> 00:58:25.950]  You don't get the respect of the controllers.
[00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:27.770]  That's their worldview.
[00:58:28.511 --> 00:58:31.012]  And they think everybody else is like them.
[00:58:31.812 --> 00:58:36.874]  They think people with morals and people that have courage, people that stand for something and build things are weak.
[00:58:37.614 --> 00:58:48.038]  But they're the parasites that have invaded and taken over the system that pro-humans of the human race of red blood built here on this planet.
[00:58:49.078 --> 00:58:50.779]  Forged from the iron of the earth.
[00:58:51.559 --> 00:58:52.440]  Destined for the stars.
[00:58:53.868 --> 00:58:56.013]  The great test is here and is upon us now.
[00:58:56.514 --> 00:59:03.269]  So here's a clip from Corbett's great little documentary, part three series, Bill Gates' Population Control Grid.
[00:59:05.356 --> 00:59:11.440]  He plays a clip from MIT and the companies they're working with, with these new chips that are like little pieces of glass.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:13.001]  You ever busted a Coke bottle in your house?
[00:59:13.602 --> 00:59:15.803]  Or a beer bottle, and it's little tiny shards.
[00:59:15.823 --> 00:59:16.443]  You can't see them.
[00:59:16.463 --> 00:59:18.225]  You step on them and it's in the bottom of your foot.
[00:59:18.745 --> 00:59:22.287]  That's what these little silicate and carbon are.
[00:59:22.327 --> 00:59:24.069]  But they've got chips etched into them.
[00:59:24.089 --> 00:59:24.549]  Here it is.
[00:59:25.309 --> 00:59:30.493]  To investigate new ways to permanently store and record the vaccination information of each individual.
[00:59:31.554 --> 00:59:34.516]  The result of their research was a new vaccine delivery method.
[00:59:35.458 --> 00:59:50.528]  They found that by using dissolvable microneedles that deliver patterns of near-infrared light-emitting microparticles to the skin, they could create particle patterns in the skin of vaccine recipients which are invisible to the eye but can be imaged using modified smartphones.
[00:59:51.628 --> 00:59:58.313]  Rice University describes the quantum dot tags left behind by the microneedles as something like a barcode tattoo.
[01:00:00.114 --> 01:00:01.675]  So who was behind this development?
[01:00:02.655 --> 01:00:04.717]  As lead researcher Kevin McHugh explains,
[01:00:05.967 --> 01:00:10.589]  The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation came to us and said, Hey, we have a real problem.
[01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:12.570]  Knowing who's vaccinated.
[01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:16.211]  So our idea was to put the record on the person.
[01:00:16.931 --> 01:00:23.514]  This way, later on, people can scan over the area to see what vaccines have been administered and give only the ones still needed.
[01:00:24.452 --> 01:00:27.013]  Oh, it's your idea to get something inside somebody's body.
[01:00:27.033 --> 01:00:34.495]  There's MIT news, but I have a stack of news here I'll show you after this report we're about to play, where they say it doesn't exist.
[01:00:34.635 --> 01:00:36.095]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:00:36.595 --> 01:00:41.837]  And now, all over Twitter especially, but Facebook and Google platforms,
[01:00:42.762 --> 01:00:43.122]  You can't
[01:01:01.894 --> 01:01:03.075]  Caitlin Bennett's doing a video on it.
[01:01:03.135 --> 01:01:06.979]  She can't even upload stuff to a bunch of platforms that says pandemic.
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.562]  They're not even checking what she says to agree with it.
[01:01:10.082 --> 01:01:12.305]  Not just banning Dockers, that was so last month.
[01:01:12.585 --> 01:01:15.007]  Not just banning Cedars-Sinai, that was so last month.
[01:01:15.588 --> 01:01:18.251]  No, now it's that you can't say pandemic.
[01:01:18.891 --> 01:01:20.894]  Ha ha ha!
[01:01:21.394 --> 01:01:22.435]  Just like that, see?
[01:01:23.607 --> 01:01:27.189]  Oh, but Trump's going to form a Blue Ribbon Commission to see if Hitler was a Nazi.
[01:01:27.629 --> 01:01:34.113]  Trump's forming a Blue Ribbon Commission when your house is on fire, you know, to see if we should send the fire department.
[01:01:34.173 --> 01:01:35.493]  I mean, this is too little, too late.
[01:01:35.673 --> 01:01:36.474]  It's a great failure.
[01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:39.235]  And Trump may be very surprised in 160 days.
[01:01:39.775 --> 01:01:41.176]  But here is COVID Pass.
[01:01:41.316 --> 01:01:45.398]  UK introduces digital health passport to monitor travel, health, and population.
[01:01:45.418 --> 01:01:49.721]  It's all just magically already built and ready, like we told you months ago, now rolling out.
[01:01:49.761 --> 01:01:50.081]  Here it is.
[01:01:51.288 --> 01:01:51.388]  Ah!
[01:01:51.448 --> 01:01:51.949]  Oh, thank God!
[01:02:00.529 --> 01:02:06.632]  Covipass is powered by the revolutionary and patented vCode and vPlatform technology.
[01:02:07.353 --> 01:02:08.413]  Here's how it works.
[01:02:08.673 --> 01:02:09.694]  A social credit score?
[01:02:09.994 --> 01:02:17.758]  Using the secure Covipass platform, an authorized healthcare professional, nurse or doctor, can apply for an administration account.
[01:02:18.098 --> 01:02:18.779]  SJW?
[01:02:19.119 --> 01:02:20.580]  By a verified individual.
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:27.346]  Only an authorized user can create a digital code to pass healthcare passport on the platform.
[01:02:28.007 --> 01:02:29.388]  The steps are as follows.
[01:02:30.249 --> 01:02:37.016]  The authorized healthcare professional creates a new passport account by filling out the individual's unique data fields.
[01:02:37.797 --> 01:02:50.760]  If the user has pre-registered at home, the healthcare professional can simply scan the individual's predefined v-code that will automatically onboard the user to... Oh, now all my health data, I've given it over to Big Tech to share!
[01:02:50.780 --> 01:02:51.821]  Oh, thank you!
[01:02:51.861 --> 01:02:52.501]  You trapped me!
[01:02:52.601 --> 01:02:54.661]  ...designated COVID-19 test kit.
[01:02:55.142 --> 01:02:56.822]  By scanning the v-code attached,
[01:02:57.082 --> 01:02:59.844]  Oh, another fat kid to boost the numbers.
[01:02:59.904 --> 01:03:04.208]  And then if we kill you later, we get more money.
[01:03:04.228 --> 01:03:06.030]  Mark yourself for death, please.
[01:03:06.070 --> 01:03:10.814]  When Bush used to talk about pit tortures, he'd go, well, these professionals are... they're very professional.
[01:03:25.236 --> 01:03:29.380]  The Covipass digital passport is then assigned to the user's v-code.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.261]  Covipass?
[01:03:30.601 --> 01:03:38.448]  An individual can use their Covipass digital passport by presenting their v-code either on their mobile... And you get special deals!
[01:03:39.736 --> 01:03:43.678]  Once scanned, you're on the digital global control grid.
[01:03:43.758 --> 01:03:46.340]  Securely using permission-based access.
[01:03:47.180 --> 01:03:54.825]  This means different information is delivered to the scanning handset based on their user ID, geolocation, time and date.
[01:03:55.045 --> 01:03:55.425]  Awesome!
[01:03:55.445 --> 01:03:56.106]  Geolocation!
[01:03:56.146 --> 01:03:58.067]  And amounts of times they have been scanned.
[01:03:58.567 --> 01:03:59.348]  Oh, tracking!
[01:03:59.368 --> 01:04:04.090]  The device does not use Bluetooth and does not track the movements of the individual.
[01:04:04.531 --> 01:04:07.953]  No, only the phone you're carrying around with all your personal data.
[01:04:08.613 --> 01:04:14.338]  They do not eat cows we butcher, only smaller pieces we butcher.
[01:04:14.358 --> 01:04:16.380]  So before they were worried about even metadata.
[01:04:27.350 --> 01:04:31.293]  Now it's like, it's only your name, health history, and how small your penis is.
[01:04:31.313 --> 01:04:31.914]  Oh, crowd management!
[01:04:31.934 --> 01:04:32.014]  Oh!
[01:04:32.054 --> 01:04:32.154]  Oh!
[01:04:32.214 --> 01:04:35.657]  Oh, it's advised by the gov... It tells if you're too close to somebody.
[01:04:35.697 --> 01:04:35.737]  Oh!
[01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:54.732]  That's what Netanyahu said, we'll all have a chip.
[01:04:54.792 --> 01:04:55.913]  It face scans me faster!
[01:04:55.933 --> 01:04:57.755]  Is there a fluid crowd control?
[01:04:57.815 --> 01:04:59.717]  It tells you where to move, your phone tells you.
[01:04:59.837 --> 01:05:01.358]  Oh my god, this is awesome.
[01:05:13.129 --> 01:05:15.570]  Who needs robots when they're turning you into one?
[01:05:15.610 --> 01:05:16.531]  Thank you, Kobe Pass!
[01:05:16.551 --> 01:05:17.792]  Thank you, submitting brats.
[01:05:17.812 --> 01:05:19.653]  Your submission is key to slavery.
[01:05:19.673 --> 01:05:19.753]  Awww.
[01:05:37.622 --> 01:05:38.603]  Thank you, Covipass!
[01:06:07.943 --> 01:06:18.231]  Of course, when there's giant rebel ships invading by the thousands a day, they won't be taking Covey Pass in the no-go zones, but you will, because you know how to submit.
[01:06:20.273 --> 01:06:22.214]  We'll be right back and give the number out.
[01:06:22.915 --> 01:06:24.336]  You saw MIT, though.
[01:06:24.356 --> 01:06:26.378]  They said Bill Gates wanted implantable chips.
[01:06:27.438 --> 01:06:28.319]  But they're liars.
[01:06:28.819 --> 01:06:30.661]  They're fake news like InfoWars.
[01:06:32.082 --> 01:06:36.566]  Well, all over the world, people are wearing their Sharia-compliant
[01:06:37.594 --> 01:06:38.235]  Headdresses.
[01:06:39.415 --> 01:06:40.196]  It's all a hoax.
[01:06:40.236 --> 01:06:41.557]  It doesn't protect you from the stupid COVID-19.
[01:06:41.657 --> 01:06:43.679]  I got the articles right here.
[01:06:43.719 --> 01:06:46.401]  Gunshot victims count as coronavirus deaths in Washington State.
[01:06:46.941 --> 01:06:47.822]  Here's the New York Times.
[01:06:47.882 --> 01:06:50.003]  Sixth name on the New York Times list of coronavirus victims.
[01:06:50.023 --> 01:06:51.745]  27-year-old man who was murdered.
[01:06:51.785 --> 01:06:52.625]  They don't care.
[01:06:53.386 --> 01:06:56.709]  It's all part of engaging in fraud.
[01:06:56.769 --> 01:06:59.411]  It's all part of saying 2 million would die.
[01:06:59.431 --> 01:07:01.032]  And it's 100,000.
[01:07:01.092 --> 01:07:02.593]  Almost all of them died of something else.
[01:07:02.613 --> 01:07:03.514]  500,000 died in the UK.
[01:07:03.534 --> 01:07:04.314]  Not even 10% of that.
[01:07:07.116 --> 01:07:13.059]  So I want to open the phones up here for medical workers, doctors, nurses, healthcare providers.
[01:07:13.099 --> 01:07:14.119]  We'll go right to your calls.
[01:07:14.159 --> 01:07:15.220]  Give each person about a minute.
[01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:16.820]  I'm not going to make you hold long.
[01:07:17.181 --> 01:07:18.761]  Max Keiser pops in for like 30 minutes.
[01:07:18.781 --> 01:07:23.303]  We'll continue on with calls after that, but he joins us in the next hour for the first 30 minutes.
[01:07:24.564 --> 01:07:25.744]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:07:25.764 --> 01:07:25.804]  877-789-2539.
[01:07:25.824 --> 01:07:25.844]  877-789.
[01:07:31.766 --> 01:07:32.367]  2-5-3-9.
[01:07:33.448 --> 01:07:37.252]  Medical workers, doctors, nurses, virologists.
[01:07:37.452 --> 01:07:40.355]  We've done this probably 15 times or so the last few months.
[01:07:40.896 --> 01:07:44.680]  Every caller calls in and says it's a giant hoax, a giant fraud.
[01:07:45.919 --> 01:07:47.681]  Cops calling whose wives are nurses.
[01:07:48.441 --> 01:07:49.162]  They say the same thing.
[01:07:49.282 --> 01:07:50.203]  Empty hospitals.
[01:07:50.663 --> 01:07:52.205]  People watching Netflix all day.
[01:07:52.245 --> 01:07:53.206]  And that's on the good side.
[01:07:53.606 --> 01:07:56.008]  Some hospitals are like orgies.
[01:07:56.228 --> 01:07:57.189]  That's just the way it is, folks.
[01:07:57.649 --> 01:07:59.431]  Doctors and nurses are very comfortable with their bodies.
[01:07:59.471 --> 01:08:00.312]  They're very promiscuous.
[01:08:00.332 --> 01:08:00.872]  It's well known.
[01:08:00.892 --> 01:08:04.956]  If you don't know about the medical field, you haven't been involved in it, but that's what's going on.
[01:08:04.976 --> 01:08:06.457]  I'm not attacking these people.
[01:08:07.038 --> 01:08:08.159]  The point is, is that
[01:08:11.249 --> 01:08:12.890]  Suicides are at record levels.
[01:08:12.930 --> 01:08:21.794]  They're reporting 80 plus percent increase in psychotropic drug prescriptions from psychiatrists of new customers since this started.
[01:08:22.174 --> 01:08:24.455]  Suicides up five-fold across the country.
[01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:26.196]  This is real, folks.
[01:08:26.256 --> 01:08:32.799]  People not being treated for pre-existing conditions is outpacing even the fake death numbers from COVID.
[01:08:33.646 --> 01:08:36.148]  But Stalin said, one man dies, it's a tragedy.
[01:08:36.168 --> 01:08:37.989]  10,000 dies is a statistic.
[01:08:38.329 --> 01:08:47.215]  They know how to focus in on each person and make it a huge deal and build it up like you're next to bring in that level of control.
[01:08:47.235 --> 01:08:48.976]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:08:49.516 --> 01:08:57.441]  We'll put the call system up on screen there and I will go to calls as soon as we're able to get them up and on the board here today.
[01:08:58.962 --> 01:09:01.124]  But here's a couple of important clips I want to get to.
[01:09:02.555 --> 01:09:04.357]  I'm not against the average Muslim.
[01:09:05.618 --> 01:09:06.699]  They're a human being with a soul.
[01:09:07.039 --> 01:09:07.960]  And a lot of them are great people.
[01:09:09.041 --> 01:09:15.406]  But the political systems of Islam are authoritarian and oppressive and anti-Western, anti-Christ.
[01:09:17.608 --> 01:09:22.632]  And you have the House of Islam, wherever Islam is in control, and outside of that is the House of War.
[01:09:23.333 --> 01:09:24.334]  And so it's non-compatible.
[01:09:24.394 --> 01:09:25.795]  But in Europe and in
[01:09:27.031 --> 01:09:34.876]  Now the United States, to a great extent, except for Trump, and especially in the UK, they're accepting the most cancerous forms of Islam.
[01:09:36.837 --> 01:09:46.342]  And so here's an Islamic call to prayer broadcast on loudspeakers in Great Britain that's been celebrated as political and spiritual diversity.
[01:09:46.402 --> 01:09:50.965]  Imagine if I bought a building in the middle of London and put a
[01:09:52.743 --> 01:09:57.865]  500 watt speaker on there and started talking about the New World Order, or about Jesus Christ.
[01:09:57.905 --> 01:10:00.526]  They'd come shut me down saying, hey, you don't have a right to do that in a public area.
[01:10:01.026 --> 01:10:09.969]  But from Michigan to Texas, from London to Los Angeles, from Rio de Janeiro to Berlin, there are call to prayers.
[01:10:09.989 --> 01:10:15.772]  I don't like to call them Chinese, but they don't put up with that, because they know it's a group trying to take them over.
[01:10:16.912 --> 01:10:18.553]  Hey, Chai comms do your thing.
[01:10:18.613 --> 01:10:19.593]  Don't try to take me over.
[01:10:22.406 --> 01:10:27.127]  So here's Islamic Call to Prayer broadcast in London from a major building.
[01:10:27.147 --> 01:10:42.792]  Here it is.
[01:10:42.812 --> 01:10:43.972]  This is planting the flag.
[01:10:45.593 --> 01:10:46.853]  This is pissing on our grave.
[01:10:49.625 --> 01:10:55.307]  And they brag on the websites, like, oh, we've conquered them, they are so weak, our women are ours, and that's a big part of sex slavery.
[01:10:55.327 --> 01:10:57.728]  Because if you are not Islamic, you're a sex slave.
[01:10:57.748 --> 01:11:00.930]  I mean, let me tell you, the Muslims invented pimping.
[01:11:02.471 --> 01:11:05.572]  It's like, it's so cool they pimp-slap our women, whether they be black or white.
[01:11:20.558 --> 01:11:22.039]  Notice he doesn't adopt your dress.
[01:11:22.279 --> 01:11:23.219]  He doesn't want to.
[01:11:23.339 --> 01:11:25.020]  No, you're going to adopt what he's saying.
[01:11:26.741 --> 01:11:28.342]  Oh, by the way, unless you're from the right family.
[01:11:30.303 --> 01:11:34.805]  You know, under Islam, they say black people aren't humans and are quote, raisin heads.
[01:11:36.462 --> 01:11:37.803]  And that they deserve to be slaves.
[01:11:37.843 --> 01:11:48.529]  That's where the transatlantic slave trade... Christians had never interpreted the Bible that Ham and Cain and Abel, that blacks were like a... the mark of Cain was black.
[01:11:48.890 --> 01:11:50.851]  Christians never taught that till the Muslims taught us.
[01:11:51.731 --> 01:11:53.032]  And then we went, oh really?
[01:11:53.412 --> 01:11:56.374]  We can enslave black people because they're of Ham and they're of Cain?
[01:11:58.235 --> 01:11:59.196]  That's in the history books!
[01:12:00.236 --> 01:12:03.719]  The Muslims literally taught Europeans about slavery.
[01:12:03.899 --> 01:12:05.901]  And look, I'm not defending anybody doing it.
[01:12:05.941 --> 01:12:06.402]  It's bad.
[01:12:07.262 --> 01:12:08.704]  But I like to know where stuff came from.
[01:12:10.185 --> 01:12:18.112]  I mean, while Europe was abolishing slavery, because people were slaves in Germany and France and what's England or Scotland today.
[01:12:18.132 --> 01:12:20.514]  I mean, you have the elites, the people, everybody else was slaves.
[01:12:21.455 --> 01:12:22.976]  I mean, you didn't do what you were told, you got killed.
[01:12:23.797 --> 01:12:24.538]  It's called feudalism.
[01:12:25.714 --> 01:12:28.897]  So Europe was about getting rid of slavery, but boy did we take the bait about 1500.
[01:12:29.857 --> 01:12:30.598]  Portugal and Spain.
[01:12:31.899 --> 01:12:33.500]  Which had just kicked the Muslims out.
[01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:42.687]  So kind of Spain and Portugal kind of picked up on that and went, well, blacks, you know, are cursed of God, and so we can do this to them.
[01:12:44.669 --> 01:12:46.370]  I mean, you know that's where that started, right?
[01:12:47.611 --> 01:12:53.056]  And it's in the Quran that black people aren't humans, and that's why
[01:12:54.898 --> 01:12:56.379]  Or they deserve what's happening to them.
[01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:01.964]  It's kind of that two-fifths, two-thirds human, all that stuff you've heard before.
[01:13:02.424 --> 01:13:05.187]  That all came out of this, and I'm not even attacking Islam.
[01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:07.429]  I'm just not going to sit here and play games with this.
[01:13:08.349 --> 01:13:10.651]  I want the Christianity of Jesus Christ.
[01:13:12.273 --> 01:13:19.699]  And what Martin Luther King said, we judge people off what they do and how they produce and what they stand for, not off what color they are.
[01:13:20.119 --> 01:13:21.100]  That's what we believe in.
[01:13:22.366 --> 01:13:28.409]  Well, according to the Shiites, you're not even have a seat at the table unless you're related to Muhammad.
[01:13:32.171 --> 01:13:34.192]  Okay, I mean, give me a break, man.
[01:13:34.292 --> 01:13:36.673]  Look at North Korea with a hereditary dictatorship.
[01:13:36.773 --> 01:13:37.334]  It's a joke.
[01:13:39.074 --> 01:13:45.017]  So here's the Lib Dem leader fasting for holy month of Ramadan in solidarity with Muslims.
[01:13:45.618 --> 01:13:47.879]  So there's this Dem Democrat leader over there.
[01:13:48.928 --> 01:13:54.189]  It's an early rise for me today as I prepare for my first ever fast in the holy month of Ramadan.
[01:13:54.209 --> 01:13:58.690]  I want to show solidarity with Muslims who are in isolation during this month.
[01:14:20.325 --> 01:14:36.036]  This big, creepy, you know, lout is just here, oh the Muslims, oh I'm gonna virtue signal to them, oh that I'm fasting, oh yeah right, he'll be 20 pounds fatter at the end of it.
[01:14:36.276 --> 01:14:41.419]  Here, here, let's listen to this total capitulation, this leftist bending you over the barrel, here it is.
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:45.662]  Show sold out to Muslims who are in isolation during this month.
[01:14:46.451 --> 01:14:52.134]  And this evening there'll be a Lib Dem Ifta when we have a virtual community meal together.
[01:14:53.115 --> 01:14:54.475]  So Ramadan Mubarak.
[01:15:00.519 --> 01:15:01.980]  Notice there's no family with that guy.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.842]  It's a disgusting blob.
[01:15:07.923 --> 01:15:09.564]  Brian Stelter's cousin in the UK.
[01:15:09.624 --> 01:15:11.605]  I mean, these people make me sick.
[01:15:12.773 --> 01:15:14.234]  But it's all about virtue signaling.
[01:15:14.414 --> 01:15:15.035]  Oh, we're here.
[01:15:15.595 --> 01:15:17.096]  Got a big welfare state for you.
[01:15:17.657 --> 01:15:18.437]  Come over here and rape us.
[01:15:18.457 --> 01:15:19.818]  We're going to come back with your phone calls.
[01:15:20.779 --> 01:15:23.902]  On the other side, we're talking to health care workers.
[01:15:23.942 --> 01:15:24.882]  We're talking to medical workers.
[01:15:24.902 --> 01:15:28.645]  We're talking about your view on what's really happening, what your take is on all this.
[01:15:28.665 --> 01:15:30.487]  We're going to talk to Andy in Georgia.
[01:15:31.087 --> 01:15:34.009]  On the other side, and so much more today.
[01:15:34.150 --> 01:15:36.631]  And then Max Keiser is going to pop in, which is great.
[01:15:36.651 --> 01:15:39.454]  I like Max, but it's just a serious show on RT.
[01:15:41.243 --> 01:15:43.185]  If he does that show, we're going to have a nice discussion.
[01:15:43.225 --> 01:15:50.851]  If it just turns into like a Tourette's syndrome of Bitcoin production promotion, I'm going to end it.
[01:15:51.211 --> 01:15:53.433]  Because I'm just, I'm out of gas, man.
[01:15:53.813 --> 01:15:54.634]  And I like Max Keiser.
[01:15:54.654 --> 01:15:55.975]  I like the Max Keiser on his show.
[01:15:56.355 --> 01:15:58.017]  The Max Keiser on my show, I don't like him.
[01:15:58.557 --> 01:15:59.378]  He needs to go away.
[01:15:59.878 --> 01:16:00.579]  So we'll see what happens.
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.000]  Welcome back.
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:04.201]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:16:04.301 --> 01:16:05.282]  Max Keiser is coming up.
[01:16:05.302 --> 01:16:06.423]  We're taking your calls right now.
[01:16:07.103 --> 01:16:08.544]  John is in Tennessee.
[01:16:08.584 --> 01:16:12.287]  He's an HCA manager of health care records for hospitals.
[01:16:12.927 --> 01:16:20.332]  I was just covering how the New York Times is putting out lists of people shot by guns, killed by cars, died of cancer.
[01:16:20.392 --> 01:16:21.613]  They're saying COVID-19.
[01:16:21.973 --> 01:16:23.134]  Washington State's been caught.
[01:16:23.174 --> 01:16:23.854]  It's all mounting.
[01:16:24.395 --> 01:16:28.718]  Why did major governors like Michigan and others under UN directives say
[01:16:29.198 --> 01:16:34.841]  Hey, I've noticed that there's a lot of information being shared that really scratches the surface of HIPAA violations, in my opinion.
[01:16:34.881 --> 01:16:41.425]  Like, I shouldn't be able to point at my neighbor and say, I think he's got anything.
[01:16:55.293 --> 01:16:57.374]  Yeah, we've got laws protecting our medical records.
[01:16:57.414 --> 01:16:59.474]  Now we're just told, oh, Big Tech's tracking you.
[01:16:59.494 --> 01:17:01.635]  Oh, all your medical records are public now.
[01:17:01.695 --> 01:17:02.355]  Yeah, it's sick.
[01:17:03.495 --> 01:17:06.936]  So that's changed somehow, because that's not an issue at all.
[01:17:07.616 --> 01:17:08.256]  Well, exactly.
[01:17:08.276 --> 01:17:12.157]  If you release something about who's in the hospital, you go to jail for 10 years.
[01:17:12.197 --> 01:17:15.098]  But now, suddenly, it's just a bum rush on our final rights.
[01:17:15.178 --> 01:17:16.758]  I mean, that's all it is.
[01:17:18.098 --> 01:17:24.780]  I also wanted to mention, so specifically what I do is try to help the physicians get paid.
[01:17:25.755 --> 01:17:28.597]  About 180 hospitals or so.
[01:17:31.099 --> 01:17:41.046]  This cryptocurrency is pretty much what I do now, only it's the reverse.
[01:17:41.547 --> 01:17:45.510]  We wait for people to tell us what they did, and then we approve that work.
[01:17:45.930 --> 01:17:53.796]  They're going to reverse that in the cryptocurrency system, and they're going to hand out your tasks like a communist dictatorship where
[01:17:54.332 --> 01:17:56.334]  You're told what you're gonna do today, no matter what it is.
[01:17:56.354 --> 01:17:58.277]  If you have to go kill somebody, that's what you gotta do.
[01:17:58.297 --> 01:17:59.438]  If you wanna get paid.
[01:17:59.839 --> 01:18:01.821]  You know, that's not the way it's supposed to work.
[01:18:02.482 --> 01:18:06.507]  You're supposed to tell us what you did today, and we're gonna approve that work, and then you might get payment.
[01:18:07.227 --> 01:18:08.469]  It shouldn't be the other way around.
[01:18:08.669 --> 01:18:10.091]  They're pre-paying everybody.
[01:18:10.912 --> 01:18:13.315]  It's gonna reverse everything, and I think it's a horrible idea.
[01:18:14.116 --> 01:18:15.077]  I don't know how we can avoid it.
[01:18:15.337 --> 01:18:18.440]  And again, that's in the patents, that's what's being pushed and promoted.
[01:18:18.740 --> 01:18:21.222]  Then they counter and go, oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:18:21.502 --> 01:18:26.246]  What do you make of that, where they roll it out publicly, then they say it's a conspiracy theory?
[01:18:29.149 --> 01:18:41.239]  It's just a way to misdirect, to try to point, they're going to try to point the finger, I think you brought this up, where they are the heroes, and they come out smelling like roses that everybody wants to buy.
[01:18:41.724 --> 01:18:49.828]  You know, everybody has to have whatever they're selling, which is, I think that's Bill Gates' word, that we have to create the requirement for our existence.
[01:18:50.368 --> 01:18:51.388]  He said something like that.
[01:18:52.048 --> 01:18:52.849]  And so that's what they're doing.
[01:18:52.869 --> 01:18:57.231]  They're pointing the finger at everybody else, saying, look at you, look what you're doing, when that's what they're doing.
[01:18:59.712 --> 01:19:00.092]  That's my opinion.
[01:19:00.192 --> 01:19:06.275]  I don't see how Bill Gates gets away with it, but he's gotten away with so much, that's why he just keeps doubling down like a psychotic criminal.
[01:19:06.995 --> 01:19:09.536]  It's interesting how he was quiet for so long, isn't it?
[01:19:09.983 --> 01:19:12.924]  He dropped off the software game.
[01:19:13.584 --> 01:19:14.965]  And just went totally silent.
[01:19:15.585 --> 01:19:16.965]  You know, giving vaccines everywhere.
[01:19:18.066 --> 01:19:20.867]  And now he comes back into popularity somehow.
[01:19:21.127 --> 01:19:22.147]  Like now he's on every show.
[01:19:23.047 --> 01:19:24.548]  Telling us exactly what we're gonna do.
[01:19:25.268 --> 01:19:28.929]  He's suddenly our doctor, our father, our god, our king, our master, our lord.
[01:19:29.069 --> 01:19:29.650]  Not mine!
[01:19:29.670 --> 01:19:31.890]  But he wants to put things in our body.
[01:19:31.950 --> 01:19:33.331]  He really cares about us.
[01:19:34.411 --> 01:19:34.591]  No.
[01:19:34.991 --> 01:19:35.772]  Yeah.
[01:19:35.892 --> 01:19:36.792]  I will not be home.
[01:19:37.292 --> 01:19:38.313]  That's the only thing I can say.
[01:19:40.151 --> 01:19:42.753]  I don't know how we're supposed to avoid what's being brought down on us.
[01:19:43.954 --> 01:19:47.537]  Well, they're spoiling for a fight, but you know, Gates thought we would all just accept this.
[01:19:47.557 --> 01:19:49.259]  This is not his name.
[01:19:49.299 --> 01:19:51.220]  He's the most hated person in the world now.
[01:19:52.281 --> 01:19:53.662]  But he's, we don't even see him.
[01:19:53.682 --> 01:19:54.723]  We're not going to see what he's doing.
[01:19:54.743 --> 01:19:57.085]  The Marines are going to be delivering whatever it is he sells.
[01:19:58.066 --> 01:19:58.967]  We didn't even buy it.
[01:20:00.328 --> 01:20:00.588]  You know?
[01:20:01.289 --> 01:20:03.590]  No, that doesn't sound like a very healthy thing he's doing.
[01:20:03.691 --> 01:20:04.531]  Great point, sir.
[01:20:04.611 --> 01:20:05.172]  God bless you.
[01:20:07.816 --> 01:20:09.897]  Oh, he cried pandemic and it all came true.
[01:20:10.557 --> 01:20:12.438]  And his people even ran the lab it came out of.
[01:20:12.458 --> 01:20:14.059]  Wow, what a great guy.
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:17.720]  What a good person.
[01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:23.923]  Let's play former Van Halen front man, the Red Rocker, Sammy Hagar.
[01:20:25.524 --> 01:20:27.145]  I'm not locking down anymore.
[01:20:27.185 --> 01:20:32.207]  Then we're going to play coronavirus cover up is China's Chernobyl White House advisor.
[01:20:33.568 --> 01:20:36.489]  Robert O'Brien has to say, let's play those clips and go to more calls.
[01:20:37.628 --> 01:20:37.968]  We're good to go!
[01:21:01.998 --> 01:21:06.281]  If the damn thing wants to come and get me and kill me, let it be.
[01:21:06.361 --> 01:21:09.122]  Because I, you know, what more?
[01:21:09.603 --> 01:21:15.066]  Life isn't going to be any better from this day on for the rest of my life than it has been.
[01:21:15.466 --> 01:21:19.488]  And I swear to you, I came to grips with it and I was not afraid.
[01:21:19.508 --> 01:21:24.351]  I didn't want to get anyone else contagious if I had it, but I don't have it.
[01:21:24.793 --> 01:21:26.053]  I mean, I don't have it, man.
[01:21:26.073 --> 01:21:27.254]  I'm healthy as a friggin' tick.
[01:21:27.614 --> 01:21:30.735]  So I'm going, all of a sudden I wasn't afraid of it anymore.
[01:21:30.855 --> 01:21:32.436]  And then I got jumped up about it.
[01:21:32.456 --> 01:21:40.799]  And then I said, this is bullcrap, people being afraid and staying away from their own children and their own parents.
[01:21:41.219 --> 01:21:44.480]  And it just took the love out of families.
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:45.860]  And I hate it.
[01:21:46.481 --> 01:21:50.082]  I don't say the word hate very much, but I hate this friggin'
[01:21:50.788 --> 01:21:52.129]  Coronavirus crap.
[01:21:52.509 --> 01:21:53.590]  And I'm not afraid of it.
[01:21:53.770 --> 01:21:55.491]  And I'm not locking down anymore.
[01:21:55.791 --> 01:21:57.051]  I'll go around to anyone.
[01:21:57.392 --> 01:21:58.972]  If you don't want to be around me, fine.
[01:21:59.132 --> 01:22:00.693]  You know, just stay, keep your distance.
[01:22:00.853 --> 01:22:01.674]  I'm all cool with that.
[01:22:02.094 --> 01:22:03.715]  But it's not like I'm against that.
[01:22:04.175 --> 01:22:05.156]  But I'm sorry.
[01:22:05.556 --> 01:22:08.578]  It doesn't, I have no fear at my age about it.
[01:22:08.758 --> 01:22:10.218]  And so how do you like that?
[01:22:10.559 --> 01:22:16.862]  Now, but wait a minute, now that I've known three, only three people out of the thousands of people that I know,
[01:22:17.546 --> 01:22:18.327]  Have got it.
[01:22:18.927 --> 01:22:26.492]  One guy is a very unhealthy 67 year old guy who got it, lasted 10 days and he's over it.
[01:22:27.152 --> 01:22:33.956]  A little, and his son, uh, nine years old, healthy as a tick, lasted four days and they were diagnosed.
[01:22:33.976 --> 01:22:34.457]  They had it.
[01:22:34.497 --> 01:22:37.098]  They went to the hospital, said, Hey, I'm feeling terrible.
[01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:38.219]  I got this terrible fever.
[01:22:38.559 --> 01:22:40.020]  Now I can, you know, my chest is tight.
[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:40.981]  I'm coughing, coughing.
[01:22:41.261 --> 01:22:43.222]  They just gave him some antibiotics, bang, bang, bang.
[01:22:43.695 --> 01:22:47.236]  And another guy in his thirties had got it, and he was fine.
[01:22:47.276 --> 01:22:48.357]  He said it was a horrible flu.
[01:22:48.377 --> 01:22:49.857]  He said, it was miserable.
[01:22:49.877 --> 01:22:50.458]  You don't want to get it.
[01:22:50.478 --> 01:22:50.818]  That's me.
[01:22:50.838 --> 01:22:51.878]  You don't want to get it, Jamie.
[01:22:52.158 --> 01:22:56.000]  But he goes, you know, five, six days later, I start feeling pretty good.
[01:22:56.020 --> 01:22:57.340]  And then it's totally over.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.481]  So I'm saying, I don't know anybody that died for me.
[01:22:59.521 --> 01:23:00.741]  You read about people that died.
[01:23:00.801 --> 01:23:02.562]  So I'm just going, I'm not afraid of it anymore.
[01:23:02.582 --> 01:23:03.822]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:23:04.243 --> 01:23:05.523]  Everybody be their own self.
[01:23:05.583 --> 01:23:07.844]  I'm not trying to sway anyone in any direction.
[01:23:08.257 --> 01:23:10.839]  But Sammy Hagar, that guy that we're talking about.
[01:23:11.219 --> 01:23:12.400]  Oh, no, that we're talking to.
[01:23:12.480 --> 01:23:13.962]  Yeah, that we're talking to.
[01:23:13.982 --> 01:23:14.422]  Yeah, that guy.
[01:23:15.743 --> 01:23:17.004]  But it is all a panic.
[01:23:17.124 --> 01:23:18.105]  It is all a fear.
[01:23:18.245 --> 01:23:19.026]  It is all a fraud.
[01:23:19.046 --> 01:23:23.449]  They're taking all the heart attack, all the cancer, all the car wreck, all the gunshots, all the flu.
[01:23:23.970 --> 01:23:26.051]  And they're putting it in that column to get money.
[01:23:26.532 --> 01:23:32.256]  And they're putting sick people on purpose who aren't even old at nursing homes to infect them.
[01:23:32.376 --> 01:23:34.038]  They're just seeing what we'll put up with.
[01:23:34.058 --> 01:23:35.659]  This is like, this is a sick joke.
[01:23:35.699 --> 01:23:36.540]  They're laughing.
[01:23:39.016 --> 01:23:39.376]  At us.
[01:23:40.557 --> 01:23:41.037]  Insane.
[01:23:41.117 --> 01:23:41.818]  You're guilty.
[01:23:42.278 --> 01:23:43.519]  When did you rape your wife last?
[01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:46.261]  When did you kill your neighbor last?
[01:23:46.281 --> 01:23:47.822]  You're like, oh, you could have it!
[01:23:48.142 --> 01:23:48.922]  Wear your mask!
[01:23:49.022 --> 01:23:49.923]  Show you're a hero!
[01:23:51.584 --> 01:23:54.406]  And it's all orchestrated by the very people that engineered this whole mess.
[01:23:55.407 --> 01:23:57.288]  Fauci and Gates and all these people.
[01:24:01.651 --> 01:24:04.793]  Derek in California, biomedical worker at a hospital on COVID-19.
[01:24:05.053 --> 01:24:06.173]  What's your view on the situation?
[01:24:06.214 --> 01:24:06.734]  Thanks for calling.
[01:24:07.751 --> 01:24:08.672]  It's a complete fraud.
[01:24:08.692 --> 01:24:10.753]  This hospital's been empty.
[01:24:10.773 --> 01:24:13.875]  The workers have been pulled off of work.
[01:24:14.315 --> 01:24:15.456]  All of our hours reduced.
[01:24:16.196 --> 01:24:18.297]  This is a complete and utter hoax.
[01:24:20.739 --> 01:24:33.687]  People who say they've had the COVID-19 and have been around everybody and this contact tracing thing, which is getting a little bit out of hand here, it's a fraud.
[01:24:33.747 --> 01:24:34.948]  Healthy people can't get it.
[01:24:35.268 --> 01:24:36.929]  And if you have enough vitamin D,
[01:24:37.734 --> 01:24:42.620]  If you're out in the sun like a good, strong, healthy person, a smart person, you're not going to get this.
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:43.661]  You're not going to get sick.
[01:24:43.701 --> 01:24:44.642]  There is no pandemic.
[01:24:45.804 --> 01:24:51.090]  There has been zero demonstrated scientific contagion around this.
[01:24:51.771 --> 01:24:56.697]  Nobody is following scientific protocols when it comes to contagion, when it comes to a virus.
[01:24:57.406 --> 01:25:03.288]  They're working at this institution here in California on that RNA vaccine.
[01:25:03.428 --> 01:25:06.849]  They are receiving the funds from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:25:06.909 --> 01:25:12.830]  We get weekly updates on this, and it's available to the public if you guys are interested in what they're doing here.
[01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:15.351]  There's BSL-3 going on.
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:27.611]  And all I want to say is people deserve to, one, get educated that there are cures for this, natural cures.
[01:25:27.891 --> 01:25:29.213]  One, ozone therapy.
[01:25:29.353 --> 01:25:30.956]  Ozone therapy isn't even brought up.
[01:25:32.242 --> 01:25:43.144]  Online, right now, you can find that there is a clinic in Spain that is doing O3 therapy with immense success for anybody that is sick with this particular disease.
[01:25:43.644 --> 01:25:46.865]  And yet, it's against the FDA regulations here in the United States.
[01:25:46.885 --> 01:25:48.545]  Instead, it's the line from Caddyshack.
[01:25:48.565 --> 01:25:50.826]  Snag a tube down their throat and call me in five or six hours.
[01:25:51.586 --> 01:25:52.106]  Let's come back.
[01:25:52.126 --> 01:25:54.347]  I want to give you the floor because you're obviously a smart person, Derek.
[01:25:54.687 --> 01:25:56.167]  Biomedical worker in a hospital.
[01:25:56.187 --> 01:25:58.327]  And I've got the articles here.
[01:25:58.447 --> 01:26:00.628]  A big article by Mike Adams is excellent on the whole.
[01:26:02.129 --> 01:26:03.870]  New, quote, DNA vaccines.
[01:26:04.230 --> 01:26:05.391]  The mRNA vaccines.
[01:26:05.411 --> 01:26:06.471]  We're gonna come back in two minutes.
[01:26:06.491 --> 01:26:07.452]  We're gonna go right to Derek.
[01:26:08.733 --> 01:26:10.234]  And then we've got Max Keiser popping.
[01:26:10.254 --> 01:26:13.096]  And then we'll go to Bob and Robin and Andy and DJ and everybody.
[01:26:13.456 --> 01:26:14.957]  And then Paul, Joseph Watson.
[01:26:14.977 --> 01:26:15.437]  But listen.
[01:26:16.798 --> 01:26:18.199]  They're censoring this everywhere.
[01:26:18.719 --> 01:26:20.701]  Medical workers, scientists, doctors are being blocked.
[01:26:20.721 --> 01:26:23.182]  People saying anything against the narrative are being blocked.
[01:26:23.222 --> 01:26:24.403]  That's why this is so precious.
[01:26:24.703 --> 01:26:26.725]  It's why you spreading the word is king.
[01:26:27.984 --> 01:26:28.485]  Welcome back.
[01:26:28.545 --> 01:26:29.646]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:26:29.706 --> 01:26:38.694]  Next segment, Ilhan Omar has come out and made a comment that dovetails with the Democrats, that she doesn't care if Biden rapes women.
[01:26:38.734 --> 01:26:39.435]  He's a good guy.
[01:26:40.135 --> 01:26:42.458]  Well, we know, lady, you love Somalia.
[01:26:44.079 --> 01:26:47.442]  Your family helped run criminal activities there.
[01:26:48.502 --> 01:26:50.203]  Now you're here in the happy hunting land.
[01:26:50.623 --> 01:26:53.465]  Derek is a very informed biomedical worker.
[01:26:53.485 --> 01:26:55.287]  You've got four minutes till break.
[01:26:55.427 --> 01:26:55.967]  Four and a half minutes.
[01:26:55.987 --> 01:26:56.547]  You've got the floor.
[01:26:56.868 --> 01:26:58.549]  Tell us what you're witnessing out in California.
[01:27:00.730 --> 01:27:01.471]  Loads of fear.
[01:27:01.491 --> 01:27:02.391]  I see people with fear.
[01:27:02.411 --> 01:27:04.253]  I don't wear masks.
[01:27:04.273 --> 01:27:07.775]  And when I go to Costco and purposely don't walk in, the
[01:27:08.576 --> 01:27:11.559]  With a mask on, the workers, they don't say anything to me.
[01:27:11.879 --> 01:27:12.620]  Everyone looks around.
[01:27:12.660 --> 01:27:15.202]  The only people that put me down are other health care workers.
[01:27:15.242 --> 01:27:20.987]  They come in in scrubs and they say, you're not wearing a mask, and they don't want to get into it with me.
[01:27:21.047 --> 01:27:31.697]  But also the farmers market, you can't really much do anything unless you're following the Santa Clara County health guidelines, which are pretty egregious against human rights.
[01:27:32.262 --> 01:27:45.492]  The most egregious thing I really strongly feel is this shutdown of churches, because the power of prayer is a deep human trait that we all deserve to get back to.
[01:27:45.512 --> 01:27:49.875]  And I'm sure everyone listening to this knows about it, but we deserve to pray.
[01:27:49.895 --> 01:27:51.876]  It's a psychic connection to God.
[01:27:51.976 --> 01:27:53.297]  It's real communication.
[01:27:54.398 --> 01:27:55.539]  It's the sixth sense.
[01:27:57.100 --> 01:27:57.700]  Absolutely.
[01:27:57.901 --> 01:28:01.043]  And when we tap into this power, and we all have this power,
[01:28:01.857 --> 01:28:02.738]  We were born with it.
[01:28:02.898 --> 01:28:07.000]  If we weren't taught how to use it growing up, that's a travesty.
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:13.464]  We all deserve to know that we can, in silence and solitude or wherever we are, we can always have a prayer active and going.
[01:28:13.524 --> 01:28:14.484]  And the globalists know that.
[01:28:14.524 --> 01:28:16.746]  They fight constantly to cut us off from that power.
[01:28:17.926 --> 01:28:20.388]  And 5G is about that.
[01:28:20.908 --> 01:28:24.971]  We're moving into a time right now where humanity is going to make a bump.
[01:28:25.131 --> 01:28:26.572]  And we're going to get a bump in light.
[01:28:26.592 --> 01:28:28.193]  We have been getting bumps in light.
[01:28:28.313 --> 01:28:30.394]  And look what they do to the sky.
[01:28:31.263 --> 01:28:34.324]  They're putting them with chemicals over here in California.
[01:28:34.404 --> 01:28:37.486]  It just disgusts me and I weep to see that.
[01:28:37.506 --> 01:28:38.526]  That should be classified.
[01:28:38.546 --> 01:28:42.808]  There is a global darkening project that's made the earth 30% darker.
[01:28:43.488 --> 01:28:43.788]  Exactly.
[01:28:43.808 --> 01:28:45.389]  They're physically trying to make it dark.
[01:28:45.409 --> 01:28:46.990]  Yep.
[01:28:47.210 --> 01:28:59.655]  And load us up with more metals so that these 5G towers that are popping up all over the Bay Area can somehow influence us more and keep us cordoned off and spiritually dead.
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:01.621]  This is why I pray.
[01:29:02.161 --> 01:29:15.132]  I pray daily, almost non-stop, and I encourage everyone listening to reach out with your heart to the soul of this universe that those in power can make a new choice.
[01:29:16.213 --> 01:29:20.557]  That they can choose to be free and free the rest of us.
[01:29:21.718 --> 01:29:23.179]  Alex, I just want to thank you for having
[01:29:24.008 --> 01:29:24.769]  I think so.
[01:29:43.101 --> 01:29:43.521]  Yeah, yep.
[01:30:10.865 --> 01:30:13.506]  Well, let me ask you this, though, as we go to break here, you're making great points.
[01:30:15.766 --> 01:30:21.727]  This all looks scary, and I'm really upset about it, and I get mad, too, but I see this as badly coordinated and falling apart.
[01:30:22.007 --> 01:30:34.950]  They got a bunch of sheep following what they're doing, but the awakening's pretty big, so I want the people to not be too down as well, because I get down myself, but I've got to realize there's a lot of innings left in this baseball game.
[01:30:35.250 --> 01:30:36.510]  They went too soon, Alex.
[01:30:36.810 --> 01:30:40.511]  Everyone I talk to is awake, and this wasn't so two years ago.
[01:30:41.587 --> 01:30:45.628]  Two years ago, most people didn't care, and rarely did I ever see anything MAGA.
[01:30:48.668 --> 01:30:50.229]  I try to wake people up wherever I go.
[01:30:50.889 --> 01:30:53.529]  My BMW has an Alex Jones bumper sticker.
[01:30:54.149 --> 01:30:55.890]  Nobody else is wearing anything similar.
[01:30:56.270 --> 01:31:06.631]  I wake up wherever I can possibly plant those seeds, but right now, what these guys have done is hilarious, because now... Hold on, hold on.
[01:31:06.691 --> 01:31:09.612]  Finish that point, then Max Kossner's coming on, but I'll be back in 60 seconds.
[01:31:12.003 --> 01:31:17.568]  All right, Max Keiser is about to have some huge breaking news as we get him on Skype from his undisclosed location.
[01:31:17.588 --> 01:31:22.833]  When I was finishing up with Derek, a biomedical worker at a hospital on COVID-19, saying it's a giant hoax.
[01:31:23.373 --> 01:31:24.334]  We've not screened your calls.
[01:31:24.354 --> 01:31:26.476]  That's what every medical worker that calls in for months says.
[01:31:26.996 --> 01:31:30.580]  Empty hospitals, they're ordered to put people that have other diseases as COVID-19.
[01:31:31.781 --> 01:31:34.683]  New York Times puts up names, people that died of gunshot wounds and COVID-19.
[01:31:36.107 --> 01:31:36.487]  Don't worry.
[01:31:52.847 --> 01:31:53.607]  Just tell the story true.
[01:31:53.627 --> 01:31:58.669]  I was in a liquor store with my wife about two weeks ago getting some beer and wine for a party some friends were gonna have.
[01:31:59.509 --> 01:32:02.030]  And I'm in there and there's like 40 people in there.
[01:32:02.651 --> 01:32:03.571]  And they just mobbed me.
[01:32:03.971 --> 01:32:05.752]  They're all like, I used to think you were full of it.
[01:32:05.772 --> 01:32:06.292]  I'm a liberal.
[01:32:06.312 --> 01:32:06.652]  You're right.
[01:32:06.692 --> 01:32:07.352]  It's all a scam.
[01:32:07.392 --> 01:32:08.053]  It's all a fraud.
[01:32:09.273 --> 01:32:11.234]  That's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:32:11.254 --> 01:32:12.554]  There's a huge awakening.
[01:32:13.135 --> 01:32:14.315]  People really get now.
[01:32:14.375 --> 01:32:15.255]  This is a clampdown.
[01:32:15.275 --> 01:32:15.876]  This is a fraud.
[01:32:15.896 --> 01:32:16.436]  This is a hoax.
[01:32:16.456 --> 01:32:18.417]  So briefly, Derek, finish your point.
[01:32:19.457 --> 01:32:22.198]  You're seeing that you've seen just an explosion of awakening.
[01:32:23.158 --> 01:32:23.858]  Explosion.
[01:32:24.238 --> 01:32:27.539]  There's not a single person I talked to that doesn't say this isn't fake now.
[01:32:27.619 --> 01:32:28.180]  They're done.
[01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:30.560]  These people here in California, we're done.
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:36.282]  The Bay Area, you want to talk about, I think the group that's the most affected are the Hispanics.
[01:32:36.462 --> 01:32:39.803]  They're such a hard-working group of people and they're all out of work.
[01:32:40.123 --> 01:32:44.164]  80% or more here, I think it's 85% in California, they're out of work.
[01:32:44.204 --> 01:32:46.785]  The Hispanic community, they're sitting here
[01:32:48.008 --> 01:32:51.629]  They're living on their retirement and savings, and they seized right through it.
[01:32:51.829 --> 01:32:56.331]  And this is probably the... Oh, it's total siege to make us dependent.
[01:32:58.751 --> 01:33:06.754]  The thing is, if they don't finish this off with some sort of coup de grace coming from the uppers, they're going to lose.
[01:33:07.214 --> 01:33:07.774]  It's done.
[01:33:08.354 --> 01:33:09.995]  Because everyone is so awake now.
[01:33:10.035 --> 01:33:12.016]  And you can't fool people twice.
[01:33:12.036 --> 01:33:13.316]  They're not going to be able to do this again.
[01:33:14.258 --> 01:33:15.759]  And Newsom's gotta go.
[01:33:16.039 --> 01:33:17.721]  And I'm not the only one to think that.
[01:33:17.781 --> 01:33:23.205]  Gavin Newsom, American psycho, that guy is drunk on power.
[01:33:23.445 --> 01:33:28.288]  And everyone around him and that Pelosi crime gang, we need to kick them out.
[01:33:28.429 --> 01:33:37.295]  I think everyone knows what's going on right now enough to, when the next voting round comes, this is why they're gonna have to do paper ballot votes, and they see it coming, they know that they're not popular.
[01:33:37.315 --> 01:33:42.459]  For goodness sake, the sun healed, and we can't go to the beaches?
[01:33:44.327 --> 01:33:49.512]  There's patrols that go up and down the beaches that make people who are laying out on the sand get up.
[01:33:49.552 --> 01:33:50.933]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[01:33:50.993 --> 01:33:51.534]  All right, brother.
[01:33:51.574 --> 01:33:52.414]  Thank you so much, Derek.
[01:33:52.434 --> 01:33:58.380]  All right, joining us now is Max Kaiser, famous stockbroker, TV host with
[01:34:00.103 --> 01:34:05.667]  You name it, he's done it with the BBC and RT and Al Jazeera and everything in between.
[01:34:06.367 --> 01:34:08.709]  And he's here with MaxKaiser.com.
[01:34:08.789 --> 01:34:12.051]  And you know, he did say months ago that Bitcoin would be way up and it has gone up.
[01:34:12.471 --> 01:34:13.612]  I'm not a Bitcoin investor.
[01:34:13.772 --> 01:34:16.154]  So there's sides that are like anti-Bitcoin, pro-Bitcoin.
[01:34:16.494 --> 01:34:18.055]  I just have guests that don't talk about topics.
[01:34:18.095 --> 01:34:19.336]  So everybody trying to put me in a camp.
[01:34:19.916 --> 01:34:20.957]  That's not what's going on here.
[01:34:21.377 --> 01:34:26.058]  We're going to get into Bitcoin some at the bottom of the hour with him, but he's got a lot of things to get into here.
[01:34:26.578 --> 01:34:29.559]  What is happening in the economy, stock market, which is way up today.
[01:34:29.599 --> 01:34:31.979]  We can put up the Dow Jones Industrial Average maybe here.
[01:34:32.699 --> 01:34:35.980]  What is the Fed doing buying six trillion in junk assets and speculation?
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:38.500]  It goes to 100 trillion.
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:41.181]  What is the update on the casino good log?
[01:34:41.681 --> 01:34:44.162]  Is America being taken private by private equity?
[01:34:44.882 --> 01:34:49.563]  And we're going to talk about the cantilena there, if I'm pronouncing that right.
[01:34:49.903 --> 01:34:50.963]  People getting rich off the
[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:56.802]  Alex Jones, great to be on with you again, my friend, my good friend Alex Jones.
[01:34:56.822 --> 01:34:57.322]  What's happening?
[01:35:14.753 --> 01:35:17.094]  Well, I got Max Keiser on, who's a smart cookie.
[01:35:17.514 --> 01:35:18.494]  What's really going on?
[01:35:18.574 --> 01:35:19.135]  Is Trump good?
[01:35:19.195 --> 01:35:19.775]  Is Trump bad?
[01:35:19.815 --> 01:35:20.875]  What's happening with the economy?
[01:35:21.195 --> 01:35:24.217]  What's happening with the trillions they keep saying they're putting into the economy?
[01:35:24.537 --> 01:35:25.317]  The lockdown?
[01:35:25.337 --> 01:35:27.438]  This term?
[01:35:29.819 --> 01:35:30.039]  Right.
[01:35:30.099 --> 01:35:36.161]  Well, let's go back to kind of update the conversation that we've been having.
[01:35:36.221 --> 01:35:38.742]  I think we've been having this now for seven or eight years.
[01:35:39.488 --> 01:35:45.929]  And it has to do with the American economy, the global economy, and it has to do with money itself.
[01:35:46.529 --> 01:35:50.310]  So what we have experiencing right now in the U.S.
[01:35:51.230 --> 01:35:54.811]  is that there's a huge boom in the stock market.
[01:35:55.711 --> 01:36:02.853]  And that boom is benefiting a very select few of billionaires or what we call cantillionaires.
[01:36:02.993 --> 01:36:04.373]  And I'll explain what that means in a second.
[01:36:05.006 --> 01:36:10.269]  Meanwhile, as you read, the unemployment rates are skyrocketing and people are suffering.
[01:36:10.289 --> 01:36:14.411]  They're forced to shelter at home and deprived of basic sunlight.
[01:36:14.892 --> 01:36:24.057]  But somehow, the top 1% of the 1% is making out hundreds of millions, hundreds of billions of dollars are pouring into these pockets.
[01:36:24.097 --> 01:36:28.139]  So the establishment is waging war on us and vertically integrating everything right now.
[01:36:29.827 --> 01:36:34.010]  Yeah, basically, you know, let's get back to a basic point about fiat money.
[01:36:35.231 --> 01:36:42.396]  It's the economy can be described as the creation of debt money and all fiat money is debt money.
[01:36:42.757 --> 01:36:55.626]  When the creation of debt money is slower than the rate at which it's collapsing, the bond market's collapsing or the economy is collapsing, then you have economic pullback and you have a stock market pullback.
[01:36:56.107 --> 01:36:59.249]  When the debt money is being created at a faster rate,
[01:37:00.032 --> 01:37:04.214]  And its underlying economy is deteriorating.
[01:37:04.794 --> 01:37:06.675]  Then you have the stock market rally.
[01:37:07.075 --> 01:37:09.016]  But at the end of the day, it's still debt money.
[01:37:09.136 --> 01:37:13.598]  All debt money for the past 300 years, all fiat debt money, has gone to zero.
[01:37:13.998 --> 01:37:19.340]  Including the British Pound, which has lost 98% of its purchasing power over the past 300 years.
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:25.743]  So now, knowing that its demise was here, it's waging war against the real economy, making us think that we need it.
[01:37:25.763 --> 01:37:28.764]  So this is really about making us take on more of their loans.
[01:37:30.339 --> 01:37:35.062]  Well, anytime a dollar is introduced into the economy, the debt is increased.
[01:37:35.503 --> 01:37:41.347]  And the Cantillon effect is how this wealth transfer takes place.
[01:37:41.407 --> 01:37:48.211]  So the way that the fiat money is distributed, the debt money is distributed, is distributed through the banks, through the Wall Street banks.
[01:37:48.251 --> 01:37:49.392]  That's where it goes first.
[01:37:50.153 --> 01:37:56.817]  And the bankers and their friends, they use their fiat gift from the central bank to buy back their own stock.
[01:37:57.578 --> 01:37:59.419]  So their own stocks go up in value.
[01:38:00.228 --> 01:38:04.109]  And it could be Apple, it could be Microsoft, it could be any of the large corporations.
[01:38:04.129 --> 01:38:07.369]  They buy back their own stock with the free money they get from the central bank.
[01:38:08.069 --> 01:38:14.170]  And of course, all the executives have stock options tied to the current stock price, but they only pay $1 for an option.
[01:38:14.870 --> 01:38:18.171]  So if the stock goes up $20, that $1 option is not worth $20.
[01:38:18.211 --> 01:38:19.971]  They make 20x.
[01:38:20.872 --> 01:38:22.832]  And so this is how the game is played.
[01:38:22.932 --> 01:38:24.892]  So why couldn't Obama do it at the level Trump is?
[01:38:24.972 --> 01:38:29.413]  Why does the establishment so mad at Trump, but then he's doing exactly what you think they want?
[01:38:31.041 --> 01:38:38.168]  Well, during Obama's administration, he had to repeal a lot of things in the law to make this easier.
[01:38:38.649 --> 01:38:39.790]  He had to get rid of Glass-Steagall.
[01:38:40.431 --> 01:38:43.714]  That happened during Clinton, which is a part of the Democratic establishment.
[01:38:44.175 --> 01:38:46.217]  Also, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act.
[01:38:46.812 --> 01:38:47.493]  We're good to go.
[01:39:05.199 --> 01:39:08.261]  There are laws in place, Alex, but none of them are being enforced, right?
[01:39:08.301 --> 01:39:14.986]  So like Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan, he's now worth a couple of billion dollars and he got there by breaking the law.
[01:39:15.306 --> 01:39:26.373]  And we know that because he's had to face criminal charges many times that were paid off with a fine or civil charge that was paid off with a fine.
[01:39:27.651 --> 01:39:31.734]  So his business model is to keep 90 cents of every dollar he steals.
[01:39:32.415 --> 01:39:34.256]  And that's the business model of America.
[01:39:34.316 --> 01:39:39.179]  Most businesses in America follow this money laundering kind of fake economy.
[01:39:39.299 --> 01:39:45.063]  Even the Bank of America recently said that they accused the Federal Reserve Bank of engaging in fake markets.
[01:39:45.723 --> 01:39:48.725]  Another fake market that's similar is the fracking market.
[01:39:48.765 --> 01:39:52.268]  They lose incredible amount of money on every dollar they spend.
[01:39:52.848 --> 01:39:54.690]  The fracking industry has never been profitable.
[01:39:54.790 --> 01:39:56.152]  It's never been cash flow positive.
[01:39:56.172 --> 01:39:58.475]  Sure, everybody knows wildcatting is a speculative deal.
[01:39:59.551 --> 01:40:02.692]  But fracking is uniquely money losing.
[01:40:02.912 --> 01:40:09.214]  In wildcatting, you might hit a whale one out of 50, or one out of 20, and it pays for itself.
[01:40:09.294 --> 01:40:10.535]  Okay, that's different than fracking.
[01:40:10.835 --> 01:40:15.837]  Fracking, we know that the amount of capital that goes in... No, I was just using that as another example.
[01:40:15.897 --> 01:40:16.617]  So stay there.
[01:40:16.637 --> 01:40:18.898]  Let's come back and talk about where it's going next.
[01:40:19.138 --> 01:40:20.878]  Because this is all really important, folks.
[01:40:21.358 --> 01:40:24.059]  Because now they want to kill the real economy to feed it to Wall Street.
[01:40:24.079 --> 01:40:27.280]  Even though we all starve to death, they'll still be quintillionaires.
[01:40:27.981 --> 01:40:28.461]  We'll be right back.
[01:40:28.481 --> 01:40:28.801]  Stay with us.
[01:40:30.854 --> 01:40:32.216]  Cantillionaires!
[01:40:32.596 --> 01:40:34.518]  Max Keiser is here to define it for us.
[01:40:35.099 --> 01:40:40.365]  He's got swanbitcoin.com forward slash keiser is the main site he wants you to visit.
[01:40:41.146 --> 01:40:41.786]  Okay, so Max.
[01:40:43.251 --> 01:40:44.571]  Look, I want to be a fan of Trump.
[01:40:45.371 --> 01:40:48.812]  And the fact is, I've been persecuted really bad for being a Trump supporter.
[01:40:48.852 --> 01:40:49.752]  So I'm kind of pig-headed.
[01:40:50.293 --> 01:40:53.113]  It makes me want to support him more.
[01:40:53.553 --> 01:40:57.334]  Quite frankly, if I hadn't been persecuted so much, I probably wouldn't support Trump as much.
[01:40:57.354 --> 01:40:59.815]  I try to be aware of my own sick psychology.
[01:41:00.395 --> 01:41:02.215]  Obviously, I like him better than Hillary.
[01:41:02.475 --> 01:41:04.456]  Obviously, I'm trying to be disruptive to the globalists.
[01:41:04.476 --> 01:41:07.276]  But Trump keeps trying to give Wall Street what they want.
[01:41:07.316 --> 01:41:10.457]  They don't appreciate that because they want the money and they want the power.
[01:41:11.377 --> 01:41:12.818]  But don't just go along with my view.
[01:41:12.958 --> 01:41:13.899]  What is your real view?
[01:41:13.939 --> 01:41:16.300]  Let's take the gloves off and we'll get into all the issues with you.
[01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:18.322]  You were trying to get to it as we came to break.
[01:41:18.942 --> 01:41:23.385]  What the hell's going on with Trump allowing the censorship now of the word pandemic?
[01:41:23.445 --> 01:41:27.688]  If you're not an approved site, you can't even type that into Twitter or YouTube.
[01:41:28.689 --> 01:41:32.131]  Now YouTube is blocking what the Communist Party says to block.
[01:41:32.651 --> 01:41:33.732]  That's big news today.
[01:41:33.752 --> 01:41:37.695]  I mean, it's like it isn't just Alex Jones being censored now.
[01:41:37.975 --> 01:41:40.977]  It's everyone in live time surveillance.
[01:41:41.677 --> 01:41:44.059]  Totally draconian, social credit scores.
[01:41:44.459 --> 01:41:47.301]  They're using the COVID-19 for the world digital currency.
[01:41:49.443 --> 01:41:51.324]  Bill Gates has his own crypto.
[01:41:51.724 --> 01:41:53.365]  What in Hades is the big picture?
[01:41:54.866 --> 01:41:55.106]  Right.
[01:41:55.126 --> 01:41:59.429]  Well, Trump only really looks at one metric and that's the stock market.
[01:41:59.870 --> 01:42:05.714]  That's what he gauges his self, his approval and his own self-worth on the stock market.
[01:42:05.874 --> 01:42:07.175]  You know, he's a guy from New York.
[01:42:07.235 --> 01:42:10.617]  He grew up, he came of age during the 1980s when the stock market boomed.
[01:42:11.372 --> 01:42:18.875]  And the world's kind of focused on stock markets as we had a transition from an industrial and agricultural economy to a financialized economy.
[01:42:19.295 --> 01:42:22.696]  The stock market becomes the center of everyone's financial consciousness.
[01:42:23.057 --> 01:42:30.840]  And that Dow Jones Index average is tells you minute by minute how you do in life and what you're worth.
[01:42:31.320 --> 01:42:38.002]  And so when he does everything he can to pump stocks, he's a stock pumper and he's done a great job in pumping stock.
[01:42:38.122 --> 01:42:39.683]  Unfortunately, that means he's
[01:42:40.214 --> 01:42:46.356]  I'm all for laissez-faire and big markets and I get they build things and enthusiasm bills, but like you were saying...
[01:42:56.909 --> 01:42:57.890]  No, it's not.
[01:42:58.450 --> 01:43:01.272]  It's Bernie Madoff on PCP, though.
[01:43:01.572 --> 01:43:04.874]  When it's all a fraud and we just give it all the power, it's going to destroy us.
[01:43:05.355 --> 01:43:05.755]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:43:05.855 --> 01:43:07.476]  Right, it's not building anything.
[01:43:07.956 --> 01:43:09.417]  It's not laissez-faire capitalism.
[01:43:09.597 --> 01:43:20.765]  It's the furthest thing from laissez-faire free market capitalism because all this free money printing that's awarded to the insiders who use it to buy back their own stock and run away with billions.
[01:43:20.785 --> 01:43:21.806]  So I'm saying it's crony capitalism.
[01:43:21.846 --> 01:43:22.246]  It's rigged.
[01:43:23.109 --> 01:43:23.309]  Right.
[01:43:23.449 --> 01:43:25.390]  And what that does is has two effects.
[01:43:25.451 --> 01:43:36.477]  Not only does it award the least talented amongst us, but entrepreneurs get crowded out because they don't have access to that capital because all that capital is going to the crony capitalists, the kleptocracy.
[01:43:36.938 --> 01:43:40.360]  So the base of new enterprises and all the
[01:43:40.871 --> 01:43:46.975]  Thousands of small to medium-sized enterprises in America are starving for capital right now, and that means that's the seed stock.
[01:43:47.096 --> 01:43:48.997]  That's America in 20 years, 30 years, 40 years.
[01:43:49.057 --> 01:43:50.058]  And that's your next point.
[01:43:50.638 --> 01:43:53.700]  This ultra-rich that hoard the money and put it back into the fraud.
[01:43:54.981 --> 01:43:57.803]  Right, and you can see it clearly in what's called the money velocity chart.
[01:43:58.204 --> 01:44:02.587]  If you do a quick search, you know, your staff over there for money velocity, it'll pop up.
[01:44:03.447 --> 01:44:06.409]  It'll do a quick and you'll see it goes crashing straight down.
[01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:11.352]  That is the kind of the EKG chart of how the American economy is doing.
[01:44:11.613 --> 01:44:19.078]  If money velocity goes up that means that small to medium sized enterprises are building and borrowing and building and borrowing and they're working.
[01:44:19.338 --> 01:44:22.160]  If it's crashing as you can see by this chart now it means that
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:26.221]  The insiders, the cantillionaires, as I call them, are hoarding the cash.
[01:44:26.241 --> 01:44:28.942]  They're not loaning it out to small and medium-sized enterprises.
[01:44:29.382 --> 01:44:31.203]  And they're just buying their own stock back.
[01:44:31.283 --> 01:44:37.185]  I was about to say, I looked at the Bill and Melinda Gates report that came out last week on their tax-free foundation and what it bought.
[01:44:37.945 --> 01:44:43.207]  And it's no more farming or ranching or industry or service.
[01:44:43.687 --> 01:44:45.068]  It's all big tech.
[01:44:45.488 --> 01:44:46.008]  That's it.
[01:44:46.328 --> 01:44:46.848]  And medical.
[01:44:46.928 --> 01:44:51.230]  So they are completely exiting a real economy and doubling down on the fraudulent one.
[01:44:51.290 --> 01:44:51.970]  Exactly what you're saying.
[01:44:53.157 --> 01:44:53.377]  Right.
[01:44:53.477 --> 01:44:58.202]  They're creating what I call the casino gulag, which is a term I coined on your show a few years ago.
[01:44:58.623 --> 01:45:00.605]  And the casino gulag is thriving right now.
[01:45:00.645 --> 01:45:03.988]  People are sheltering at home and they're forced to go online.
[01:45:04.589 --> 01:45:12.197]  And the model here is if you click on an ad, you might get a protein pill or you're going to starve to death and you won't be able to go outside.
[01:45:12.557 --> 01:45:16.521]  And remember that for every dollar you click an ad on a site like Facebook,
[01:45:17.148 --> 01:45:23.851]  Facebook Corporation can use that recurring revenue stream to borrow $100,000 from the central bank.
[01:45:24.332 --> 01:45:29.574]  So that's how the leverage works against everybody who's not an insider at these major tech companies.
[01:45:30.035 --> 01:45:39.960]  It's all based on buying back your own stock, getting free money from the Fed, and imposing this casino gulag model, and not making capital available to small to medium enterprises.
[01:45:40.020 --> 01:45:44.482]  And you end up with a neo-feudalism.
[01:45:44.642 --> 01:45:46.123]  So now we've got wealth
[01:45:46.479 --> 01:45:46.759]  Thank you.
[01:46:08.173 --> 01:46:12.637]  Okay, so I started out by saying, you know, let's review the history of money.
[01:46:13.097 --> 01:46:14.419]  All fiat money is debt money.
[01:46:14.779 --> 01:46:16.681]  None has survived in the past 300 years.
[01:46:17.401 --> 01:46:18.382]  Okay, so what is money?
[01:46:18.462 --> 01:46:20.624]  There's only two forms of money right now that are worth anything.
[01:46:20.664 --> 01:46:22.666]  Gold, and we know why gold's worth something.
[01:46:22.886 --> 01:46:24.428]  It's been worth something for thousands of years.
[01:46:25.074 --> 01:46:25.874]  And Bitcoin, right?
[01:46:25.914 --> 01:46:27.114]  Bitcoin is the new gold.
[01:46:27.495 --> 01:46:28.755]  It's gold 2.0.
[01:46:29.655 --> 01:46:32.576]  The way it came about was something of an industrial accident.
[01:46:33.276 --> 01:46:38.557]  You know, programmers are trying to figure out how to create digital files that you couldn't copy.
[01:46:39.417 --> 01:46:43.978]  And what they accidentally stumbled into was the hardest money ever in the history of humankind.
[01:46:44.358 --> 01:46:49.199]  And now it's become this Godzilla currency monster that's competing with gold.
[01:46:49.219 --> 01:46:50.799]  Isn't that the essence of value?
[01:46:50.900 --> 01:46:52.040]  Something you can't copy.
[01:46:52.060 --> 01:46:52.960]  That means the genuine.
[01:46:54.045 --> 01:46:54.405]  Exactly.
[01:46:55.086 --> 01:46:55.406]  That's right.
[01:46:55.426 --> 01:47:00.368]  You don't want to easily counterfeit your money, like the Fed.
[01:47:02.009 --> 01:47:07.071]  Donald Trump calls up Jay Powell and says, I'm really unhappy with the stock market being down 2% today.
[01:47:07.111 --> 01:47:11.513]  Can you please print another $4 trillion of phony fiat U.S.
[01:47:11.553 --> 01:47:12.474]  dollar money, please?
[01:47:12.634 --> 01:47:17.236]  And so the corporations can buy back their own stock with free money and make the stock market go up, please?
[01:47:17.336 --> 01:47:18.816]  Because that's the only thing I look at.
[01:47:18.836 --> 01:47:19.977]  That's the only thing I look at.
[01:47:20.458 --> 01:47:21.499]  But Alex, here's the deal.
[01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:23.981]  We've talked about Bitcoin for a few years.
[01:47:24.282 --> 01:47:33.931]  And so today I am basically, I'm going to throw down the gauntlet and I'm going to change your viewers lives right now.
[01:47:34.412 --> 01:47:38.656]  I'm going to give every one of your viewers $10 of free Bitcoin right now.
[01:47:38.896 --> 01:47:45.242]  If they go to swanbitcoin.com forward slash Alex, the promo code Alex, they'll get
[01:47:46.211 --> 01:47:47.933]  $10 free Bitcoin right now.
[01:47:48.413 --> 01:47:48.954]  Right now.
[01:47:49.414 --> 01:47:50.996]  That's your on-ramp to Bitcoin.
[01:47:51.076 --> 01:47:54.479]  Okay, well, I'll be accused in some SEC thing.
[01:47:54.519 --> 01:47:56.100]  This is the first I'm learning of this.
[01:47:58.222 --> 01:47:58.602]  That's right.
[01:47:58.682 --> 01:48:00.364]  I'm not playing anymore.
[01:48:00.624 --> 01:48:13.375]  Okay, we're going to finally make a solution available to your listeners that are now going to experience the hardest money ever in the history of humankind and escape the fiat money prison.
[01:48:13.995 --> 01:48:19.838]  All right, swanbitcoin.com forward slash, or you can use forward slash Kaiser, use my name, or forward slash Allen.
[01:48:20.219 --> 01:48:21.219]  It'll get you to the same place.
[01:48:21.259 --> 01:48:24.161]  You get $10 free Bitcoin.
[01:48:24.261 --> 01:48:25.222]  That's the best deal.
[01:48:25.522 --> 01:48:27.103]  Here's the deal, here's the deal.
[01:48:27.143 --> 01:48:37.428]  Listen, when I said I like currencies outside the system, just not even for their speculative value, but so you could actually get across the border with money that's yours and to take care of your family.
[01:48:37.649 --> 01:48:43.232]  So when I told you I like, I get the concept of Bitcoin, I don't like the speculation, the wars, but this is what I'm talking about.
[01:48:43.692 --> 01:48:44.413]  You're on the show.
[01:48:44.453 --> 01:48:47.255]  I knew you'd probably plug Bitcoin, but now... What speculation?
[01:48:47.676 --> 01:48:48.877]  Promo code Alex here.
[01:48:48.897 --> 01:48:53.561]  They're gonna have the damn FBI coming out of black helicopters in probably six hours over this.
[01:48:54.022 --> 01:48:56.664]  I don't even know... I thought you were ready to fight the war.
[01:48:56.684 --> 01:48:58.706]  I thought you were fighting the New World Order.
[01:48:58.786 --> 01:49:00.488]  I thought you were ready to go to battle.
[01:49:00.628 --> 01:49:05.252]  I thought you were ready to go into the ring with the fiat money.
[01:49:05.532 --> 01:49:07.014]  If I'm going to prison, where's my paycheck?
[01:49:07.737 --> 01:49:14.100]  All right, Max Keiser is a really interesting fella, and I've been having him on the air for, I don't know, probably 15 years.
[01:49:15.381 --> 01:49:18.343]  And he's here with us, and I knew he'd come on today and talk about Bitcoin.
[01:49:19.542 --> 01:49:24.403]  And you had him like Schiff over there when I had him on a few months ago, like, oh, Jones endorses Bitcoin.
[01:49:24.783 --> 01:49:27.184]  He sold out after years of not selling out.
[01:49:27.284 --> 01:49:29.004]  I haven't gotten a dollar from Bitcoin.
[01:49:29.464 --> 01:49:30.605]  I'm not in the stock market.
[01:49:30.645 --> 01:49:31.605]  I'm not in Bitcoin.
[01:49:32.245 --> 01:49:44.548]  I ran into Max Keiser in Austin, Texas, and I said, yeah, let's put up the graph from the Wall Street Journal of where it was a few years ago at that big high, and they said it was dead, and now it's gotten close to half its gains back.
[01:49:45.823 --> 01:49:49.185]  I'm all about new currencies and things that are outside the system.
[01:49:49.825 --> 01:50:02.230]  But Max, again, I don't think on your RT show you sit there and go, oh my gosh, here's your free $10 worth of Bitcoin for people with the name Alex.
[01:50:02.891 --> 01:50:09.674]  When they go to that, is that for Alex Jones Show or is that for Alexander the Great, Alexander Graham Bell, Alexander de Tocqueville?
[01:50:10.054 --> 01:50:12.675]  Who is this Alexander that's endorsing this?
[01:50:13.824 --> 01:50:14.304]  Exactly.
[01:50:14.704 --> 01:50:17.225]  It's just that it's a generic Alex.
[01:50:17.385 --> 01:50:17.986]  It's generic.
[01:50:18.046 --> 01:50:20.767]  It doesn't refer to any individual living or dead.
[01:50:20.787 --> 01:50:22.567]  Well, no, I'll be... Here's the thing.
[01:50:22.667 --> 01:50:29.550]  I'll be accused of some conspiracy with you, and then I'm trying to pump Bitcoin up here.
[01:50:29.570 --> 01:50:30.790]  I don't even know anything about this.
[01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.571]  You can't.
[01:50:31.671 --> 01:50:36.733]  It's too... It's already beyond the ability of any one individual to affect the price.
[01:50:36.793 --> 01:50:40.554]  You know, it's become sewn into the fabric of the global economy.
[01:50:41.154 --> 01:50:49.720]  And those who don't want to get involved are going to find that all of their fiat money... No, I'm learning that whether you want to be involved or not, you are.
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:54.304]  Okay, well how much Bitcoin do I get today on the show from Max Keiser?
[01:50:54.824 --> 01:50:58.327]  One thing I've learned with these Bitcoin people is they've got tighter asses than I do.
[01:50:58.707 --> 01:51:01.609]  I can guarantee I can give you $10 worth of Bitcoin.
[01:51:01.909 --> 01:51:02.910]  By clicking on Kaiser.
[01:51:03.070 --> 01:51:09.756]  You go to swanbitcoin.com forward slash Kaiser, register to the site, and you get 10 bucks of free Bitcoin right now.
[01:51:10.036 --> 01:51:10.776]  Let's just say that.
[01:51:10.816 --> 01:51:11.897]  Okay, forget about it.
[01:51:11.977 --> 01:51:16.181]  This is Max Kaiser trolling Alex Jones, which is an entertaining, entertaining thing.
[01:51:16.681 --> 01:51:17.242]  You know, I...
[01:51:17.902 --> 01:51:29.708]  I'm just up here trying to promote American freedom and trying to expose, because I agree with you on your market analysis and what's going to happen to the economy, but... Right, but what's the root cause of the problem is the money, Alex.
[01:51:29.728 --> 01:51:32.450]  That's what I've been saying for 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years.
[01:51:32.490 --> 01:51:34.891]  The root cause is this fiat money.
[01:51:35.211 --> 01:51:39.934]  And unless you have a solution for that, you're going to be always on the losing end.
[01:51:39.954 --> 01:51:46.938]  And because you are righteous and you are holy and Bitcoin is holy that I've learned about this major promotion for the first time here live on air.
[01:51:47.498 --> 01:51:50.961]  I just looked at the track record and I just looked at what's been going on.
[01:51:51.001 --> 01:51:53.642]  I've been right for, you know, ten years.
[01:51:53.762 --> 01:51:56.865]  Nine years I've been talking about it and I haven't been wrong yet.
[01:51:56.885 --> 01:52:00.907]  That's a tremendous track record.
[01:52:01.428 --> 01:52:03.249]  Peter Schiff's been wrong for nine years.
[01:52:03.969 --> 01:52:05.911]  He's been wrong for nine years.
[01:52:05.931 --> 01:52:07.112]  You should not say anything.
[01:52:07.132 --> 01:52:10.374]  I haven't gotten my check from him promoting his Chinese stocks yet either.
[01:52:12.130 --> 01:52:25.679]  Well, you know, he's lax in his analysis and he's unable to provide any kind of worthwhile prediction or analysis.
[01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:32.944]  Yeah, but sometimes you have to look past the immediate gratification option, look to the bigger picture.
[01:52:33.244 --> 01:52:37.667]  Are you in the interest of the wider interest of your audience as a whole?
[01:52:38.388 --> 01:52:45.341]  Beyond any short-term immediate gratification, then you'd see that this is a solution to take everybody out of the malaise of the sphere.
[01:52:45.361 --> 01:52:46.163]  Did you say short-term?
[01:52:46.243 --> 01:52:48.166]  Dude, I can't bet on something.
[01:52:49.090 --> 01:52:50.390]  Let me explain something to you, Max.
[01:52:50.410 --> 01:52:51.151]  Max, stop.
[01:52:51.211 --> 01:52:51.491]  Stop.
[01:52:51.511 --> 01:52:51.751]  Let me talk.
[01:52:51.791 --> 01:52:52.571]  It's not a bet!
[01:52:52.691 --> 01:52:53.271]  Don't filibuster.
[01:52:53.291 --> 01:52:54.612]  This is a lifestyle change.
[01:52:54.632 --> 01:53:06.716]  If I'm promoting vitamin D3 that is essential, I know it works, or vitamin C, or PQQ, or CoQ10, or iodine, that stuff I know I'm giving people a sure bet.
[01:53:07.156 --> 01:53:09.056]  I'm not saying people are bad to get Bitcoin.
[01:53:09.296 --> 01:53:11.297]  They just better not bet the mortgage on it.
[01:53:11.357 --> 01:53:13.878]  That's all I'm saying is, for me, it's a speculative thing.
[01:53:14.458 --> 01:53:17.859]  And so that's why I think it might be interesting for people to get a small piece of it just to see what happens with it.
[01:53:18.219 --> 01:53:19.540]  I just... Exactly!
[01:53:19.620 --> 01:53:20.500]  That's what I'm saying!
[01:53:20.560 --> 01:53:23.041]  I just learned about this on the date, dude.
[01:53:23.361 --> 01:53:29.323]  You like picked me up at my front door and all of a sudden you got me on the couch, my legs behind my ears, and you know, I didn't know this was about to happen.
[01:53:29.363 --> 01:53:30.163]  Max, you're raping me.
[01:53:32.341 --> 01:53:36.004]  Well, you can talk to me during the break.
[01:53:36.084 --> 01:53:37.385]  I'm here to chat with you.
[01:53:37.505 --> 01:53:38.245]  I identify as a woman.
[01:53:38.265 --> 01:53:43.629]  You're back there having some excellent Austin barbecue in the conference room and some of that mashed potatoes.
[01:53:43.709 --> 01:53:46.471]  I know it's irresistible, but you should talk to me during the break.
[01:53:46.711 --> 01:53:48.172]  You know, you leave me hanging out here.
[01:53:48.692 --> 01:53:52.395]  I'm trying to fix the problem by offering a solution out of fiat money.
[01:53:52.735 --> 01:53:54.637]  Bitcoin has proven itself over nine years.
[01:53:54.777 --> 01:53:55.978]  It's never gone down.
[01:53:55.998 --> 01:53:59.200]  For a major promotion, I have to agree with the position.
[01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:05.683]  I have to think it's moral, I have to think it's overall a good bet for my audience, I have to understand it, I have to tell them, and then I gotta get paid.
[01:54:05.703 --> 01:54:10.425]  Because I gotta fund this operation and feed all these little baby birds that are very hungry.
[01:54:10.805 --> 01:54:11.966]  The guy around the moon needs money.
[01:54:11.986 --> 01:54:12.866]  He's like a little baby bird.
[01:54:13.326 --> 01:54:14.087]  Well, let's talk!
[01:54:14.247 --> 01:54:15.047]  Let's talk, you know?
[01:54:15.307 --> 01:54:16.248]  Maybe I jumped the gun a bit.
[01:54:16.268 --> 01:54:18.589]  Oh, it's always, I'm gonna get the money, I'm gonna get the money.
[01:54:19.269 --> 01:54:21.590]  You know, it's important that we get this information out there.
[01:54:21.610 --> 01:54:22.351]  I think you would agree about that.
[01:54:22.431 --> 01:54:24.692]  I'll get a worm on hook, I'll get the money, I'll get the money, I'll get the money.
[01:54:24.752 --> 01:54:25.092]  Alright, listen.
[01:54:26.007 --> 01:54:26.988]  Max, I love you to death.
[01:54:27.008 --> 01:54:28.249]  Let me be serious here with you.
[01:54:28.569 --> 01:54:29.390]  We're going to make it work.
[01:54:30.150 --> 01:54:31.631]  You're going to love this.
[01:54:31.651 --> 01:54:34.353]  This is the ultimate red pill.
[01:54:34.413 --> 01:54:36.375]  The ultimate red pill, Alex, is Bitcoin.
[01:54:36.395 --> 01:54:37.516]  The ultimate red pill.
[01:54:39.297 --> 01:54:42.699]  Or you're a doll that has a string that says Bitcoin, ultimate red pill, when you pull it.
[01:54:43.580 --> 01:54:46.002]  I'm asking you, Max, how high do you think Bitcoin will go?
[01:54:47.223 --> 01:54:50.465]  The track record, you know, you said the same thing when it was a dollar, Alex.
[01:54:50.845 --> 01:54:51.386]  Now it's at 8,000, 9,000.
[01:54:53.277 --> 01:54:53.497]  Right.
[01:54:53.657 --> 01:54:54.998]  So you've been saying this for nine years.
[01:54:55.138 --> 01:55:02.282]  I'm saying, let's get over this hesitancy and your shyness about starting and being a part of this revolution.
[01:55:02.422 --> 01:55:04.624]  Let's jump in, be a part of the revolution.
[01:55:04.644 --> 01:55:05.404]  Why are you so shy?
[01:55:05.424 --> 01:55:09.607]  CF told me that I am literally your acolyte and your minion.
[01:55:10.307 --> 01:55:14.493]  Well, she's been wrong for seven or eight years.
[01:55:14.573 --> 01:55:17.898]  He hasn't had a right call since the 2008 housing crisis.
[01:55:17.938 --> 01:55:19.641]  He's been wrong now for 12 years.
[01:55:19.741 --> 01:55:21.664]  He hasn't said a single correct thing in 12 years.
[01:55:21.684 --> 01:55:22.124]  Well, he did.
[01:55:22.385 --> 01:55:23.386]  He said that I work for you.
[01:55:23.406 --> 01:55:24.268]  That's certainly not true.
[01:55:25.822 --> 01:55:27.584]  Everything he said about the markets is wrong.
[01:55:27.644 --> 01:55:29.165]  There's no checks around it with Max Keiser.
[01:55:29.185 --> 01:55:31.087]  He was completely wrong about the dollar.
[01:55:31.327 --> 01:55:34.010]  He was completely wrong about those paychecks from you.
[01:55:34.270 --> 01:55:36.332]  About gold, right?
[01:55:36.872 --> 01:55:39.955]  No, Alex, I mean, let's chat.
[01:55:40.035 --> 01:55:41.016]  I mean, let's chat.
[01:55:41.096 --> 01:55:42.217]  I'm just joking around.
[01:55:42.237 --> 01:55:43.519]  Where is gold and silver going?
[01:55:43.619 --> 01:55:48.023]  Chat with me during the break, and by the time you come out of break, you're going to be singing a different song.
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:49.501]  I guarantee it.
[01:55:49.561 --> 01:55:51.222]  As long as people get a victory.
[01:55:51.543 --> 01:55:53.965]  This is the time to take it to the next level.
[01:55:53.985 --> 01:55:55.066]  I sell victory, Kaiser.
[01:55:55.126 --> 01:55:55.406]  I sell success.
[01:55:55.426 --> 01:55:56.948]  This is the time to go big.
[01:55:56.988 --> 01:55:59.710]  I cannot sell something unless I know it's a winner!
[01:56:00.131 --> 01:56:02.393]  All of your marketing is like, oh, the new role model.
[01:56:02.413 --> 01:56:06.297]  Hey, before I got married, when I told the girl getting in bed with me would be a good time, you know, it was a little lie.
[01:56:06.317 --> 01:56:08.539]  Stay in the solution and get out of the problem!
[01:56:10.205 --> 01:56:13.567]  What about the overall economy outside of the universe of Bitcoin?
[01:56:14.047 --> 01:56:17.730]  What are these globalist bankers, these centillionaires, what are they going to do?
[01:56:18.030 --> 01:56:20.131]  This party, they're building bunkers.
[01:56:20.491 --> 01:56:22.352]  They're building, they know this is untenable.
[01:56:22.392 --> 01:56:23.693]  Why don't they try to stabilize things?
[01:56:24.674 --> 01:56:25.494]  Why are they doing this?
[01:56:25.634 --> 01:56:27.556]  Well, because it's working, right?
[01:56:27.616 --> 01:56:28.096]  It's working.
[01:56:28.136 --> 01:56:31.118]  This system is, it's, it's, it's working for them.
[01:56:31.158 --> 01:56:32.278]  Why would they stop?
[01:56:32.318 --> 01:56:36.481]  They were able, you know, in 1929, the stock market crashed.
[01:56:36.621 --> 01:56:51.794]  And then during the 1930s, during the Securities Act of 1933 and 1934, all new regulations were put in place to put a collar, to put a muzzle, a leash on Wall Street, to stop Wall Street from doing what it did in the 20s to bankrupt America.
[01:56:52.355 --> 01:56:58.360]  Well, since that time, in subsequent decades and administrations, the leash was taken off and they gave methamphetamine to the pit bull.
[01:56:59.364 --> 01:57:00.485]  All removed, exactly.
[01:57:00.785 --> 01:57:06.510]  And so now you've got this out-of-control, voracious monster that all it wants is that free Fed money.
[01:57:06.791 --> 01:57:13.056]  And any time you deprive it of another trillion or two from the central bank, they crash the stock market.
[01:57:13.397 --> 01:57:15.919]  And then CNBC will say, the market's crashing!
[01:57:16.479 --> 01:57:17.460]  Trump, do something!
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:20.403]  So they're holding us hostage, and Trump's great is failing.
[01:57:20.723 --> 01:57:22.465]  Right.
[01:57:22.485 --> 01:57:26.509]  We're being held hostage by the system.
[01:57:26.549 --> 01:57:38.160]  And the only way the system works is if you can print ad nauseum, if you can print infinite amounts of fiat money with no checks and balances like the system is now, because the gold standard... And you're saying when it finally goes belly up...
[01:57:40.482 --> 01:57:42.543]  See, look at a chart of inflation and wages.
[01:57:42.563 --> 01:57:44.003]  Look at our wages since 1971.
[01:57:44.844 --> 01:57:48.145]  Before 1971, wages and inflation were roughly parallel.
[01:57:48.165 --> 01:57:50.265]  They were moving up in lockstep.
[01:57:50.766 --> 01:57:52.186]  1971, America closes the gold window.
[01:57:52.506 --> 01:57:58.088]  Oh, suddenly wages go nowhere for 45 years and financialization on Wall Street.
[01:57:58.208 --> 01:58:00.729]  Oh, we've got thousands of billionaires.
[01:58:01.269 --> 01:58:01.469]  Right?
[01:58:01.529 --> 01:58:02.410]  That's what happened.
[01:58:02.690 --> 01:58:03.971]  That's what needs to be fixed.
[01:58:04.011 --> 01:58:04.871]  Yeah, we fed the middle class.
[01:58:04.891 --> 01:58:07.053]  But nobody is in power who will fix it now.
[01:58:07.493 --> 01:58:13.437]  Pelosi or Congress, they are trading on this information and becoming fabulously rich.
[01:58:13.477 --> 01:58:16.058]  They're not going to stop it, Alex, obviously.
[01:58:16.078 --> 01:58:17.539]  They're the ones.
[01:58:17.599 --> 01:58:18.560]  That's the problem.
[01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:25.124]  Ron Paul, he was the only and the last voice in Congress that stood up and said, we need to audit the Fed.
[01:58:25.344 --> 01:58:26.725]  We need to examine our money.
[01:58:26.885 --> 01:58:28.366]  We need to return to hard money.
[01:58:28.646 --> 01:58:29.507]  He's not there anymore.
[01:58:30.185 --> 01:58:32.127]  Yeah, Trump didn't take control of the Fed.
[01:58:32.167 --> 01:58:33.728]  He literally merged with it.
[01:58:33.748 --> 01:58:34.369]  We'll be right back.
[01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.190]  All right.
[01:58:36.531 --> 01:58:41.775]  I was at Bilderberg with Max Keiser eight, nine years ago in England.
[01:58:41.795 --> 01:58:43.657]  A bit longer than that.
[01:58:45.439 --> 01:58:46.119]  North of London.
[01:58:46.299 --> 01:58:48.581]  And he's like, I'm gonna give you all this Bitcoin.
[01:58:48.601 --> 01:58:49.422]  Other people offered it to me.
[01:58:49.442 --> 01:58:51.104]  I was like, listen, it's not that I'm refusing it.
[01:58:51.949 --> 01:58:57.451]  If I got involved in stock or something, I'd become so obsessed with it that I would never stop paying attention to it.
[01:58:57.511 --> 01:59:00.812]  So I pay attention to information and what's going on politically.
[01:59:01.452 --> 01:59:05.053]  But surely from where he promoted it, it was worth nothing.
[01:59:05.813 --> 01:59:07.854]  It was one of the biggest things in the market a few years ago.
[01:59:07.874 --> 01:59:08.854]  He said it would go back up.
[01:59:08.874 --> 01:59:10.135]  People said it wouldn't and it has gone back up.
[01:59:10.891 --> 01:59:18.078]  I'm not, and I'm not here not promoting it because Schiff and people attack it and say that I'm, you know, somebody's a Bitcoin scammer.
[01:59:18.098 --> 01:59:20.320]  I don't think it's Schiff, it's just very childlike.
[01:59:21.622 --> 01:59:26.887]  It's that if I can't understand something, and I am kind of a troglodyte at certain levels, I just can't pitch it, folks.
[01:59:27.467 --> 01:59:30.831]  But I think if somebody's giving you, and now I'm learning about what this deal is,
[01:59:31.991 --> 01:59:35.253]  $10 of free Bitcoin, which is a pittance, but it's a good little testing model.
[01:59:35.693 --> 01:59:37.554]  It's like my wife's like, hey, I want to get in the stock market.
[01:59:37.574 --> 01:59:38.215]  I got a little bit of money.
[01:59:38.235 --> 01:59:40.616]  I went out and said, well, just, you know, go do whatever you want.
[01:59:40.636 --> 01:59:43.658]  Just don't put money in there that you can't lose because it's gambling.
[01:59:44.898 --> 01:59:46.679]  And I like the idea.
[01:59:46.780 --> 01:59:48.200]  I wish Bitcoin was legitimate.
[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:48.901]  Maybe it is.
[01:59:49.501 --> 01:59:51.082]  And I want outside the Federal Reserve.
[01:59:51.202 --> 01:59:52.463]  I want alternative systems.
[01:59:52.543 --> 01:59:53.943]  I totally get the technology.
[01:59:54.404 --> 01:59:55.044]  It's amazing.
[01:59:55.484 --> 01:59:58.286]  My question is all the shark-like promotion
[01:59:59.967 --> 02:00:00.367]  I don't know.
[02:00:21.053 --> 02:00:24.834]  Which, I think, as long as you take it as that, you know, cheese on the mousetrap, that's fine, folks.
[02:00:24.894 --> 02:00:25.634]  A little bit of a test.
[02:00:26.095 --> 02:00:29.296]  You know, it's kind of like going to a random whorehouse, but no, no, no, seriously, I'm just not being mean.
[02:00:29.816 --> 02:00:30.676]  Let me just ask you this.
[02:00:32.497 --> 02:00:42.560]  Big picture, I know, I respect your view on the economy, and you've been dead on, you know, way better than Schiff, not being mean to Schiff, you know, Lord and Savior over there, but how bad is this going to get?
[02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:49.102]  Because I see Trump is trying to prop stuff up, because the other alternative is a total depression, and it's kind of the best
[02:00:50.672 --> 02:00:51.893]  Case of two bad choices.
[02:00:53.795 --> 02:00:55.276]  Yeah, I'm going to get to that.
[02:00:55.536 --> 02:00:59.320]  Let me just make one quick 20 second follow up to this Bitcoin conversation.
[02:00:59.340 --> 02:00:59.700]  Okay.
[02:00:59.940 --> 02:01:02.342]  There's two pieces, two main pieces to it.
[02:01:02.783 --> 02:01:03.904]  One is the price.
[02:01:04.540 --> 02:01:11.690]  And the second main piece of discussion point about Bitcoin is how it relates to the economy as a whole.
[02:01:11.991 --> 02:01:20.263]  And I think we could have an entire conversation on how Bitcoin relates to the history of money and the economy as a whole without ever mentioning price.
[02:01:20.343 --> 02:01:20.844]  The price.
[02:01:21.405 --> 02:01:24.808]  It's the least interesting part of Bitcoin, to tell you the truth.
[02:01:25.188 --> 02:01:27.410]  There's a lot more interesting pieces to it.
[02:01:27.670 --> 02:01:29.752]  But to get to your question... And why hasn't it been duplicated yet?
[02:01:29.772 --> 02:01:31.874]  Because you've been saying this for nine years, it won't be duplicated.
[02:01:31.894 --> 02:01:32.614]  You've been proving it right.
[02:01:32.894 --> 02:01:36.137]  The other problem Bitcoin has is all the fake stuff around it.
[02:01:37.618 --> 02:01:41.722]  Well, anytime you have something invaluable, people come out with fake versions of it.
[02:01:41.742 --> 02:01:46.465]  If you go down to the Champs-Élysées in Paris, you'll see fake Gucci bags.
[02:01:46.986 --> 02:01:48.447]  There's fake gold and pyrite.
[02:01:48.803 --> 02:01:49.844]  There's fake diamonds.
[02:01:50.364 --> 02:01:58.270]  Anytime someone perceives something as genuine and real and scarce and desirable, there's a lot of fake that comes out to try to capture it.
[02:01:58.290 --> 02:01:59.672]  In the case of Bitcoin, it came out in 2009.
[02:02:00.712 --> 02:02:08.098]  And since then, there have been thousands of copies, and they've all proven to be inadequate and fake, and none of them work.
[02:02:08.298 --> 02:02:09.299]  Gosh, it's been 11 years.
[02:02:09.679 --> 02:02:13.923]  So was that 2010 at Bilderberg, you offered me all that Bitcoin, and I was too dumb to download it?
[02:02:14.723 --> 02:02:18.026]  Yes, I offered your audience 10,000 Bitcoin to give away for free.
[02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:23.983]  And at that time, and you wanted to think about it and you weren't sure whether that was a good idea.
[02:02:24.003 --> 02:02:27.366]  And that's now worth, you know, hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:02:27.646 --> 02:02:29.347]  But you get my trepidation.
[02:02:31.208 --> 02:02:33.450]  Well, that's why... But I'm not a timid person.
[02:02:33.530 --> 02:02:35.171]  I charge you on what I know is right.
[02:02:35.611 --> 02:02:37.432]  And I'm not saying you're bad promoting Bitcoin.
[02:02:37.492 --> 02:02:38.513]  I wish I would have done it.
[02:02:38.913 --> 02:02:40.474]  I just now I'm so behind the curve.
[02:02:40.494 --> 02:02:41.555]  I don't even know what's going on.
[02:02:41.955 --> 02:02:43.656]  Consider this tough love, Alex.
[02:02:44.076 --> 02:02:44.837]  This is tough love.
[02:02:45.208 --> 02:02:51.451]  I love you so much, but sometimes you just gotta, you know, you gotta foot pedal to the metal and just get your friend over the hump.
[02:02:51.751 --> 02:02:54.372]  You know, they're shy, they're hesitant, they won't take the plunge.
[02:02:54.713 --> 02:02:56.293]  You know, I gotta push you over the cliff.
[02:02:56.473 --> 02:02:57.514]  Just say, look, this is it.
[02:02:58.454 --> 02:02:59.275]  This is the real thing.
[02:02:59.295 --> 02:03:00.315]  You're raping me.
[02:03:02.396 --> 02:03:03.517]  Well, it's love, Alex.
[02:03:03.977 --> 02:03:04.677]  It's love.
[02:03:04.937 --> 02:03:08.979]  But the point is that there's an entire... Some Joe Biden love?
[02:03:09.039 --> 02:03:09.780]  Can I sniff your hair?
[02:03:10.440 --> 02:03:10.740]  Please.
[02:03:10.860 --> 02:03:11.861]  Here, I'll come over here.
[02:03:12.281 --> 02:03:13.001]  Oh, you're on the screen.
[02:03:13.021 --> 02:03:13.241]  Go ahead.
[02:03:13.261 --> 02:03:14.362]  Go ahead and start sniffing.
[02:03:15.936 --> 02:03:17.937]  But the, uh, oh yeah, that's good.
[02:03:17.957 --> 02:03:18.637]  Oh, wow.
[02:03:18.657 --> 02:03:22.659]  That's vitality.
[02:03:23.379 --> 02:03:23.979]  Oh yeah.
[02:03:24.200 --> 02:03:25.060]  Oh, oh yeah.
[02:03:25.080 --> 02:03:25.500]  That's great.
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:27.641]  Oh, look, a genie's coming out of your ear.
[02:03:29.182 --> 02:03:40.427]  But, uh, to get back to your question about the economy, uh, is that the reason why it's hopeless is because to get back to this theme of debt money, right?
[02:03:40.447 --> 02:03:43.788]  When you just float debt money into the economy, you create deflation.
[02:03:44.349 --> 02:03:48.490]  Which means that everything becomes encumbered with debt, right?
[02:03:48.610 --> 02:03:50.651]  If you have too much debt, you have a problem.
[02:03:50.811 --> 02:03:55.873]  And so America has the debt to GDP is over 100%.
[02:03:55.913 --> 02:04:01.114]  Around the world, the debt to GDP is close to 300% debt to GDP.
[02:04:01.374 --> 02:04:06.296]  So when you talk to the economists like Paul Krugman of the New York Times or Stiglitz,
[02:04:06.496 --> 02:04:08.277]  So what are you predicting is going to happen?
[02:04:08.337 --> 02:04:08.837]  Just tell me.
[02:04:20.137 --> 02:04:20.837]  Neo-feudalism.
[02:04:20.937 --> 02:04:24.018]  I think that they're going to continue to print more debt.
[02:04:24.038 --> 02:04:26.819]  So they'll just steal the whole economy and leave us with no economy.
[02:04:26.839 --> 02:04:27.559]  Exactly right.
[02:04:27.579 --> 02:04:28.859]  It'll be a bifurcated economy.
[02:04:28.879 --> 02:04:32.240]  By the way, you know how powerful the meme will be if you rub my shoulders and sniff my hair?
[02:04:32.741 --> 02:04:34.201]  Can we do this live on air right now together?
[02:04:34.221 --> 02:04:34.681]  Just come on.
[02:04:35.081 --> 02:04:36.962]  I'm selling your Bitcoin and I haven't gotten money yet.
[02:04:37.102 --> 02:04:38.362]  Okay, I'll rub your shoulders.
[02:04:38.782 --> 02:04:44.784]  I'll rub your shoulders and smell your hair as long as you repeat swanbitcoin.com forward slash Alex.
[02:04:44.804 --> 02:04:45.144]  Do it.
[02:04:45.224 --> 02:04:45.484]  Do it.
[02:04:46.304 --> 02:04:46.784]  Alright, you ready?
[02:04:46.804 --> 02:04:47.505]  I did.
[02:04:47.585 --> 02:04:48.005]  Count me in.
[02:04:48.365 --> 02:04:48.945]  Count me in, buddy.
[02:04:49.969 --> 02:04:50.189]  All right.
[02:04:51.349 --> 02:04:51.689]  How's this?
[02:04:51.909 --> 02:04:52.250]  Yeah.
[02:04:52.270 --> 02:04:53.390]  You gotta rub the shoulders.
[02:04:53.810 --> 02:04:54.890]  Where are your shoulders?
[02:04:55.070 --> 02:04:56.811]  I'm looking at a camera.
[02:04:56.931 --> 02:04:57.471]  I don't see you.
[02:04:57.531 --> 02:04:58.931]  I don't have no image of you.
[02:04:58.951 --> 02:04:59.931]  I need direction.
[02:04:59.991 --> 02:05:01.092]  Can you direct me please?
[02:05:01.112 --> 02:05:02.472]  Where's your producer?
[02:05:02.752 --> 02:05:04.653]  Is your producer under the table again?
[02:05:04.953 --> 02:05:07.473]  Stop playing with guns and start producing.
[02:05:07.493 --> 02:05:09.514]  You're the producer.
[02:05:12.034 --> 02:05:13.635]  Now you can be the vice president.
[02:05:14.557 --> 02:05:16.479]  See, I'm ready to be vice president.
[02:05:17.379 --> 02:05:19.221]  This is a new level of TV, folks.
[02:05:19.661 --> 02:05:20.983]  It's interactive.
[02:05:21.803 --> 02:05:22.964]  It's better than Smell-O-Vision.
[02:05:24.526 --> 02:05:27.969]  Dude, you're a blind Joe Biden groping an Alex Jones live on TV.
[02:05:27.989 --> 02:05:30.831]  Imagine what that's like, because you're looking at a computer screen.
[02:05:30.911 --> 02:05:32.032]  Oh my God, I'm sorry to do that to you.
[02:05:32.873 --> 02:05:34.894]  And under my desk right now is Rachel Maddow.
[02:05:36.436 --> 02:05:37.737]  I'm not gay, but that is a hot dude.
[02:05:37.757 --> 02:05:38.618]  Hey look, have you seen this?
[02:05:38.638 --> 02:05:41.160]  Look, I'm wearing my yoga shirts.
[02:05:42.108 --> 02:05:43.228]  Can you see my yoga pants?
[02:05:43.468 --> 02:05:44.009]  Let's not.
[02:05:44.069 --> 02:05:44.969]  Be careful there, Max.
[02:05:45.689 --> 02:05:46.850]  Don't let that lizard up.
[02:05:47.590 --> 02:05:48.790]  Can you see my yoga pants?
[02:05:48.850 --> 02:05:50.251]  Those are very nice legs.
[02:05:51.231 --> 02:05:53.812]  You look like a tranny, like Michelle Obama.
[02:05:55.073 --> 02:05:56.373]  Yeah, I'm bringing back the 70s.
[02:05:56.673 --> 02:06:00.875]  The word is that you and Michelle are both... Hot pants are coming back, Alex!
[02:06:00.915 --> 02:06:06.377]  Hot pants are coming back at SwampBitcoin.com forward slash Alex!
[02:06:06.397 --> 02:06:07.337]  $10 free Bitcoin!
[02:06:07.857 --> 02:06:09.018]  All right, this has been fun.
[02:06:09.158 --> 02:06:09.998]  When do you register?
[02:06:10.970 --> 02:06:11.771]  I apologize.
[02:06:12.912 --> 02:06:13.813]  No lizards were hurt.
[02:06:13.833 --> 02:06:15.295]  Take the plunge, Alex.
[02:06:15.475 --> 02:06:16.776]  Don't be shy.
[02:06:17.096 --> 02:06:17.957]  Be a man.
[02:06:18.478 --> 02:06:23.303]  Put your .50 caliber gun away and own some Bitcoin and tell Peter Schiff what's up.
[02:06:23.523 --> 02:06:24.424]  He's a moron.
[02:06:24.524 --> 02:06:28.649]  He's been wrong for nine years and now you're going to be part of the New World Order.
[02:06:28.929 --> 02:06:30.290]  Peter Schiff is my daddy.
[02:06:31.071 --> 02:06:33.494]  He told me you're bad so that's why you're on the show today.
[02:06:34.673 --> 02:06:36.234]  He's been wrong for nine years straight.
[02:06:36.335 --> 02:06:37.756]  He hasn't been right about a single thing.
[02:06:37.776 --> 02:06:39.437]  Listen, I'm not in a pissing contest.
[02:06:39.477 --> 02:06:43.021]  He's just like, Jones finally sold out for the money.
[02:06:43.041 --> 02:06:43.981]  And I'm like...
[02:06:46.132 --> 02:06:46.973]  Sold out for the money.
[02:06:47.353 --> 02:06:48.514]  I want Bitcoin to be real.
[02:06:48.634 --> 02:06:51.635]  I want a currency they don't control so I can go anywhere I want.
[02:06:51.655 --> 02:06:52.876]  Is Peter Schiff a priest?
[02:06:52.996 --> 02:06:54.217]  Is Peter Schiff a nun?
[02:06:54.237 --> 02:06:59.340]  He's in a nunnery praying all day and he's totally outside of the profit motive?
[02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:06.685]  I didn't know Peter Schiff was a philanthropist who just sits and prays all day in a... Peter Schiff, get thee to a nunnery!
[02:07:07.125 --> 02:07:17.335]  I mean, to accuse somebody else of being, uh, seeking to be in business is quite rich from a guy who's been done nothing but rip folks off for 20 straight years.
[02:07:17.355 --> 02:07:20.178]  I don't think there's any proof of that.
[02:07:22.257 --> 02:07:24.978]  The proof is in all of his recommendations.
[02:07:24.998 --> 02:07:27.318]  I didn't mean to go off on a shift, Jag.
[02:07:27.678 --> 02:07:32.119]  He just, the last time you were on, like, Jones finally sold out to the money.
[02:07:32.639 --> 02:07:35.060]  In fact, that check hasn't arrived yet, Kaiser.
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:39.601]  All right, he's the most over- Well, let's talk about somebody else.
[02:07:39.641 --> 02:07:40.761]  Pick somebody else to pick on.
[02:07:40.821 --> 02:07:42.001]  I'm happy to pick on anybody.
[02:07:42.021 --> 02:07:43.081]  It doesn't have to be Peter Schiff.
[02:07:43.101 --> 02:07:43.921]  Unfortunately, we're out of time.
[02:07:43.941 --> 02:07:44.962]  He's so spent at this point.
[02:07:45.002 --> 02:07:46.502]  Paul Joseph Watson's taking over.
[02:07:47.162 --> 02:07:48.263]  Max Cosgrove, thank you very much.
[02:07:48.683 --> 02:07:52.165]  You know, Max is crazy, I'm crazy, we get together, crazy things happen.
[02:07:52.545 --> 02:07:55.567]  But if you're a TV viewer, you really missed him groping me over there.
[02:07:55.847 --> 02:07:58.088]  This is a huge Bitcoin promotion.
[02:07:59.009 --> 02:08:02.111]  I have no doubt that it's just as valuable as the Federal Reserve notes.
[02:08:02.791 --> 02:08:06.093]  Which means it's faith and credit, what's behind it, and that's that.
[02:08:06.333 --> 02:08:09.315]  And so, I just...
[02:08:12.739 --> 02:08:16.881]  You know, I wasn't going to get involved in Bitcoin till Chef told me that I'd sold out to it.
[02:08:17.522 --> 02:08:21.844]  And I'm like that close just because it's a new currency.
[02:08:22.625 --> 02:08:24.306]  And I just I've watched it.
[02:08:24.346 --> 02:08:26.467]  It's like, I'm not supposed to be involved in this.
[02:08:27.468 --> 02:08:30.190]  But then I was about to do it and Kaiser just did that whole.
[02:08:32.691 --> 02:08:34.212]  This whole audience was just gang raped.
[02:08:34.312 --> 02:08:36.553]  I mean, I hope you all realize that, but it's OK.
[02:08:36.593 --> 02:08:36.974]  It's all right.
[02:08:37.534 --> 02:08:38.675]  At least Kaiser's insane.
[02:08:39.355 --> 02:08:40.616]  He doesn't take himself too seriously.
[02:08:41.016 --> 02:08:42.237]  And that's important when you're crazy.
[02:08:46.091 --> 02:08:46.671]  All right.
[02:08:46.811 --> 02:08:51.393]  I like Max Keiser, but it always turns into a train wreck of some Wild West craziness.
[02:08:52.073 --> 02:08:53.553]  Paul Joseph Watson is about to take over.
[02:08:53.573 --> 02:08:55.394]  We're talking to DJ, Amy, and Bob.
[02:08:56.754 --> 02:08:59.935]  Let's go ahead and talk to DJ in New York.
[02:09:00.135 --> 02:09:02.456]  Friends is a hospital administrator.
[02:09:02.476 --> 02:09:05.116]  We had a lot of medical workers calling earlier, but what's your view on COVID-19?
[02:09:05.136 --> 02:09:05.796]  Go ahead.
[02:09:07.377 --> 02:09:12.518]  Well, whatever you want to call it or whatever you want to say it is, I had it.
[02:09:12.698 --> 02:09:15.159]  I caught it on a subway car in February.
[02:09:15.788 --> 02:09:19.429]  When most people didn't realize how fast it was coming here.
[02:09:20.309 --> 02:09:29.511]  And I got in the car, and I smelled the dead bacteria in the air, and the door closed behind me, and I knew I was stuck, and I knew by the next week I'd be feeling something, and I did.
[02:09:30.131 --> 02:09:35.852]  And let me tell you something, that thing filled up my lungs just about to the top.
[02:09:35.952 --> 02:09:37.753]  I had to sleep upright for two weeks.
[02:09:38.493 --> 02:09:43.634]  And truthfully, if I didn't have my silver bullet with me,
[02:09:44.344 --> 02:09:45.904]  I think I would have been in more trouble.
[02:09:46.605 --> 02:09:57.607]  I took Silver Bullet every day and I took some powdered vitamin C and a drug called naproxen, an anti-inflammatory drug that I have that took down the swelling.
[02:09:58.667 --> 02:10:01.828]  And my body was naturally able to drain off the water.
[02:10:02.948 --> 02:10:06.829]  I was about to say, we don't want people to know that it's anti-inflammatories that have been beating it.
[02:10:07.861 --> 02:10:08.141]  Yeah.
[02:10:08.861 --> 02:10:09.101]  Yeah.
[02:10:09.261 --> 02:10:11.142]  Definitely made all the difference in the world.
[02:10:11.362 --> 02:10:12.303]  So you went through this.
[02:10:12.343 --> 02:10:14.783]  How evil is it that they know all this and don't tell people?
[02:10:16.084 --> 02:10:17.985]  Well, it's even more evil than that.
[02:10:18.065 --> 02:10:23.126]  From what I know from a friend who is a, uh, he works in a hospital.
[02:10:23.166 --> 02:10:26.948]  He's an administrator at one of the top respiratory hospitals in the East Coast.
[02:10:26.968 --> 02:10:27.928]  We just put it that way.
[02:10:28.908 --> 02:10:33.330]  And the stuff that he told me that's been going on, and he's an electronic specialist.
[02:10:34.437 --> 02:10:40.880]  Don't think for a minute that 5G doesn't have something to do with the kill rate in all these areas where it's more developed.
[02:10:41.520 --> 02:10:41.721]  Okay?
[02:10:41.741 --> 02:10:42.921]  Because it definitely does.
[02:10:42.941 --> 02:10:45.262]  I want to say something before you've got to move on to Paul.
[02:10:45.282 --> 02:10:49.264]  I want to get a lot of intel out in a few seconds here, a few minutes.
[02:10:49.604 --> 02:10:56.027]  First of all, all of the respirators, what do you call them, the ventilators?
[02:10:56.648 --> 02:10:59.149]  They're all operated by Wi-Fi.
[02:10:59.955 --> 02:11:03.977]  And they all have that Chinese chip that can be remotely controlled.
[02:11:04.217 --> 02:11:08.999]  Well, my friend came into the hospital one morning, and the nurses were all upset.
[02:11:09.319 --> 02:11:18.383]  Somebody had died, maybe more than one person, and the ventilators went a little kilter overnight, and they started going up higher than they were supposed to.
[02:11:19.163 --> 02:11:25.085]  So this is something that people need to know about, aside from all the other horror stories that people are coming forward about.
[02:11:25.866 --> 02:11:26.526]  And, you know,
[02:11:28.125 --> 02:11:30.367]  The 5G is a whole lot of stuff.
[02:11:30.427 --> 02:11:31.067]  We know that.
[02:11:31.727 --> 02:11:35.390]  And the medical field and this disaster that's going on is just one of them.
[02:11:35.950 --> 02:11:39.672]  And just a side note, as far as Max, I love Max Keiser.
[02:11:39.752 --> 02:11:41.833]  I didn't mind waiting a while to listen to him.
[02:11:42.534 --> 02:11:53.200]  But all that stuff that he's talking about, which you wouldn't get into, is it's all controlled by blockchain, which is going to be working with the 5G and the Internet of Things.
[02:11:54.380 --> 02:11:56.001]  When do you know when to get out of that?
[02:11:56.141 --> 02:11:56.902]  That's the issue.
[02:11:57.392 --> 02:12:03.836]  Because you're not going to be able to get your money once they make all kinds of Mark of the Beast requirements.
[02:12:04.056 --> 02:12:06.077]  You'll be stuck if you didn't get your money out.
[02:12:06.137 --> 02:12:06.917]  So there's a problem.
[02:12:07.298 --> 02:12:11.960]  Go to Anthony Patch and look what he has to say about blockchain, the Christian truther.
[02:12:11.980 --> 02:12:15.863]  OK, so Alex, I came to the Lord in the 80s.
[02:12:16.303 --> 02:12:19.585]  I felt like I was in the wilderness until you came on the scene.
[02:12:20.005 --> 02:12:21.386]  You were a breath of fresh air.
[02:12:22.063 --> 02:12:28.426]  And just so you understand, I worked in Intel, delivering Intel to NYPD for over 30 years.
[02:12:28.927 --> 02:12:31.248]  I could do a whole show with you, okay?
[02:12:31.268 --> 02:12:50.398]  So the thing is this, what's going on now having to do with all this demonic activity, I got an awareness in the Tompkins Square Park riot, and then I shared that with Mike Taibbi, which I ended up on this million-dollar catamaran with him one day, went out sailing and told him about
[02:12:51.241 --> 02:12:52.782]  What was going on in my neighborhood.
[02:12:52.922 --> 02:13:01.485]  If you want to look at what Antifa looked like in the 1980s, just go to the video clips called Cult of Rage on YouTube.
[02:13:01.945 --> 02:13:03.386]  I'm responsible for that being there.
[02:13:03.466 --> 02:13:04.687]  I tipped off Mike.
[02:13:05.247 --> 02:13:06.247]  Let me get your name and number.
[02:13:06.267 --> 02:13:07.268]  You sound super interesting.
[02:13:07.288 --> 02:13:08.568]  Let's get DJ on as a guest.
[02:13:08.608 --> 02:13:10.389]  And I'm sorry to Amy and I'm sorry to Bob.
[02:13:10.429 --> 02:13:11.189]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:13:11.529 --> 02:13:13.070]  Paul Watson is about to take over.
[02:13:13.630 --> 02:13:15.271]  And we've got to get him on with you.
[02:13:15.511 --> 02:13:16.612]  Get Amy and Bob's number.
[02:13:16.632 --> 02:13:17.452]  Guys, call them back tomorrow.
[02:13:17.472 --> 02:13:18.732]  We're going to take their calls.
[02:13:18.792 --> 02:13:19.753]  And let's get DJ on as a guest.
[02:13:20.353 --> 02:13:22.114]  All right, Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[02:13:22.254 --> 02:13:25.795]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Band.video.
[02:13:25.856 --> 02:13:26.616]  Please spread the links.
[02:13:27.976 --> 02:13:32.899]  Well, I've been waiting expectantly for our two minutes of hate.
[02:13:33.219 --> 02:13:41.462]  There was supposed to be a nationwide Boo for Boris event at 8pm tonight in the United Kingdom.
[02:13:41.502 --> 02:13:43.403]  It's now six minutes past 8pm.
[02:13:43.423 --> 02:13:46.945]  I was looking out the window, didn't hear a peep.
[02:13:47.583 --> 02:13:56.108]  So the nationwide boo for Boris, the Orwellian two minutes of hate directed against our Prime Minister, for what reason I'll get into here in a second.
[02:13:56.917 --> 02:13:57.818]  Did not come off.
[02:13:57.858 --> 02:13:59.899]  It wasn't even trending on Twitter at the time.
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:05.283]  And, as you can see from that tweet, it fell flat on its arse, as we say here in the United Kingdom.
[02:14:05.864 --> 02:14:24.678]  Unlike the clap for the NHS event, which has achieved such religiosity and cult-like status that it happens vehemently every Thursday at 8pm without fail, but now even the founder of that applaud the NHS, applaud the health workers movement, is saying that it's become too politicised
[02:14:25.296 --> 02:14:26.657]  Too cringe, I would say.
[02:14:27.157 --> 02:14:35.643]  And now that is set to end with the last mass communist-style applause for government healthcare this Thursday at 8pm.
[02:14:35.683 --> 02:14:37.825]  I'm sure some people will be taking part in that.
[02:14:38.725 --> 02:14:50.654]  But from what I heard, in an area which is controlled by a Labour council, so you'd expect there to be a lot of Labour voters here taking part in Boo for Boris, didn't hear a single one.
[02:14:51.554 --> 02:14:52.175]  What a failure.
[02:14:52.938 --> 02:14:53.759]  What's it all about?
[02:14:53.799 --> 02:14:58.602]  Well, there's a headline here out of Sputnik, and this has been going on for nearly a week.
[02:14:59.382 --> 02:15:19.915]  People aren't angry about the fact that we've got thousands of boat migrants just showing up on the south coast of England, being given a taxi service by our government, being handed over by the French Navy to the British Navy to invade our country, then let out into the general population, I'm sure, once their totally legitimate asylum claims are processed.
[02:15:20.595 --> 02:15:22.016]  Of course, some of those migrants
[02:15:22.967 --> 02:15:27.149]  We're threatening to kill their own children if they weren't let into the country.
[02:15:27.529 --> 02:15:30.331]  But these people only want the best life for their children.
[02:15:30.371 --> 02:15:31.551]  That's why they're trying to get here.
[02:15:31.831 --> 02:15:33.152]  They don't care about that.
[02:15:33.192 --> 02:15:42.256]  They don't care about the fact that the lockdown, which was imposed by Boris Johnson, and you'd think that the lefties, the Labour voters, would oppose him on this.
[02:15:42.757 --> 02:15:44.097]  The lockdown itself?
[02:15:44.538 --> 02:15:44.758]  No.
[02:15:45.018 --> 02:15:46.999]  They want the lockdown to go on forever.
[02:15:47.339 --> 02:15:48.780]  They want it to be more strict.
[02:15:49.180 --> 02:15:51.481]  You would think that that would be a good standpoint.
[02:15:52.372 --> 02:15:57.717]  For them to express their opposition to Boris Johnson, of course, leader of the Conservative Party.
[02:15:58.257 --> 02:16:01.680]  But no, they're angry about something else.
[02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:03.242]  There's a headline out of Sputnik.
[02:16:03.942 --> 02:16:04.703]  Shame on you!
[02:16:05.104 --> 02:16:09.908]  Protesters meet Dominic Cummings with chants in front of his home in London.
[02:16:10.328 --> 02:16:18.696]  And for the past four or five days, vicious, hateful left-wing protesters have been outside Dominic Cummings' home in London,
[02:16:19.628 --> 02:16:26.874]  Dominic Cummings is a senior advisor and aide to Prime Minister Boris Johnson here in the UK.
[02:16:27.414 --> 02:16:35.281]  Just by coincidence, he was also basically the mastermind of the Brexit campaign, the Vote Leave campaign.
[02:16:35.781 --> 02:16:42.867]  So do they hate him for what he did or do they hate him for the fact that he was instrumental in taking the United Kingdom out of the European Union?
[02:16:43.127 --> 02:16:44.088]  Well, what did he do?
[02:16:45.249 --> 02:16:46.390]  Well, back in March,
[02:16:47.566 --> 02:17:06.557]  When Dominic Cummings and his wife both got ill at roughly the same time, his wife had potential coronavirus symptoms, Dominic Cummings had all the classic symptoms of coronavirus, and he's somebody who you would expect to be at risk from getting it, because of course he works within government.
[02:17:06.857 --> 02:17:08.378]  Boris Johnson himself got it.
[02:17:09.767 --> 02:17:11.668]  So they both fell ill.
[02:17:11.968 --> 02:17:24.054]  He was concerned about needing urgent childcare to look after his four-year-old son in case he, his wife, or both of them were in hospital and ill with coronavirus.
[02:17:24.974 --> 02:17:32.758]  So they claim he broke the lockdown law to travel 500 miles north to Durham in the north of England.
[02:17:33.484 --> 02:17:34.885]  To visit his parents.
[02:17:35.445 --> 02:17:52.474]  Turned out he wasn't visiting his parents, he was urgently arranging childcare for his four-year-old son to hand him over to his parents while he isolated in a cottage, a separate building that was on the property of his parents up north in Durham.
[02:17:52.694 --> 02:17:55.616]  Again, sounds like a dastardly cardinal sin, doesn't it?
[02:17:56.195 --> 02:18:06.443]  For the past five years, five days in the UK, the media has been baying for his blood, demanding his resignation.
[02:18:06.843 --> 02:18:10.966]  Hateful left-wing protesters have been outside his front door the past four days.
[02:18:10.986 --> 02:18:22.055]  Oh, and by the way, these social distancing regulations that the media is apparently so concerned about don't seem to apply to the media itself.
[02:18:22.975 --> 02:18:24.697]  Michael Hever tweeted earlier today,
[02:18:25.976 --> 02:18:27.718]  And it's on my timeline, I retweeted it.
[02:18:27.738 --> 02:18:31.703]  So the same social distancing rules that the entire country supposedly irate at Dominic Cummings for
[02:18:45.111 --> 02:18:59.163]  Disobeying or not being obeyed by the throngs of journalists who are packed tightly together, none of them obeying social distancing rules as they clamour outside his house harassing him along with the left-wing protesters.
[02:18:59.784 --> 02:19:11.054]  And for the past two days here in the UK on Twitter, media scum or hashtag scum media has been trending because again these people have completely
[02:19:12.091 --> 02:19:24.040]  Jettisoned any pretense of impartiality and they've been, again, weaponized as political tools to try and get Dominic Cummings fired because he was the mastermind of Brexit.
[02:19:24.080 --> 02:19:27.782]  This is all about Brexit, make no mistake about it.
[02:19:28.063 --> 02:19:31.505]  It's not about a car journey two months ago.
[02:19:32.726 --> 02:19:40.892]  By the way, the architects of the lockdown itself, of course, we covered this story a couple of weeks ago, Professor Ferguson, whose model
[02:19:42.034 --> 02:19:47.057]  The entire policy of the country was based on, not just the UK, other countries as well.
[02:19:47.117 --> 02:19:50.798]  He said 500,000 people would die of coronavirus.
[02:19:51.199 --> 02:19:59.082]  This is a guy whose every previous prediction, whether it be on SARS, foot and mouth disease, or a number of others, was spectacularly wrong.
[02:19:59.503 --> 02:20:00.303]  We believed him.
[02:20:00.583 --> 02:20:02.504]  We locked down the entire country.
[02:20:02.524 --> 02:20:04.885]  Now we're going to face the consequences of that.
[02:20:05.286 --> 02:20:05.886]  This guy,
[02:20:07.054 --> 02:20:13.757]  He didn't travel to a different part of England, breaking the lockdown to find urgent care for his child.
[02:20:14.118 --> 02:20:17.399]  He broke the lockdown to have sex with a married woman.
[02:20:17.739 --> 02:20:20.001]  That was in the media for about 24 hours.
[02:20:20.301 --> 02:20:24.803]  The outrage in comparison to this outrage over Dominic Cummings was minimal.
[02:20:25.923 --> 02:20:32.687]  We had another politician, Ian Blackford, who travelled from Westminster
[02:20:33.513 --> 02:20:36.234]  Up to Scotland to visit his family.
[02:20:36.294 --> 02:20:42.056]  The exact same charge that they leveled against Dominic Cummings, even though it later turned out that's not what he was doing anyway.
[02:20:42.476 --> 02:20:45.497]  He was giving his toddler over to his parents so they could care for him.
[02:20:46.138 --> 02:20:49.799]  This guy, Ian Blackford, did the same thing but worse.
[02:20:50.579 --> 02:20:55.061]  And then two days later, he's tweeting at Dominic Cummings.
[02:20:55.241 --> 02:20:56.541]  I'm afraid this sums it up.
[02:20:56.701 --> 02:20:58.682]  One rule for them and another for the rest of us.
[02:20:59.508 --> 02:21:01.509]  He did the exact same thing.
[02:21:01.949 --> 02:21:03.109]  The media said nothing.
[02:21:03.169 --> 02:21:03.449]  Why?
[02:21:03.530 --> 02:21:08.391]  Because he's in the SNP, which is the left-wing party in Scotland.
[02:21:08.431 --> 02:21:10.052]  They call it the Nationalist Party.
[02:21:10.112 --> 02:21:10.932]  It's everything but.
[02:21:11.312 --> 02:21:12.433]  It is far left.
[02:21:13.093 --> 02:21:19.135]  So Professor Lockdown can break the lockdown law to shag a married woman having an affair.
[02:21:19.155 --> 02:21:23.397]  This MP from Scotland can break the lockdown to visit his parents.
[02:21:24.403 --> 02:21:27.285]  But they're both left-wingers, so it doesn't matter.
[02:21:27.586 --> 02:21:28.747]  Somebody on the right does it.
[02:21:28.987 --> 02:21:31.068]  The media's camped out his house for a week.
[02:21:31.409 --> 02:21:33.470]  He's getting shouted at by his own neighbours.
[02:21:33.911 --> 02:21:41.777]  They're driving vans past with giant TV screens, playing the family members of crying coronavirus victims.
[02:21:42.398 --> 02:21:43.599]  But they don't care about any of that.
[02:21:43.639 --> 02:21:44.960]  They only care about Brexit.
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:47.522]  And in fact, it's now come out
[02:21:48.228 --> 02:22:01.595]  That while Dominic Cummings was ill, while he was almost certainly about to maybe have to go into hospital, there came up an attempt to delay Brexit even further and he was the one who shot it down.
[02:22:02.156 --> 02:22:03.796]  So thank God that that happened.
[02:22:03.817 --> 02:22:06.438]  That's the real reason that they were angry about it.
[02:22:08.247 --> 02:22:10.089]  Mark Antwerp on Twitter tweets about this.
[02:22:10.149 --> 02:22:12.231]  The media is in meltdown about Dominic Cummings.
[02:22:12.431 --> 02:22:16.055]  One man travelling from one end of England to the other to protect his family.
[02:22:16.495 --> 02:22:23.042]  Yet 100,000 people a week have been landing in the UK from foreign countries and they haven't battered an eyelid.
[02:22:23.402 --> 02:22:26.265]  It's about Brexit, not lockdown.
[02:22:27.722 --> 02:22:43.212]  And that's a sentiment that's shared by a lot of people, but not by the vast majority of the population, because polls still show that even amongst Leave voters, 52% of people in the United Kingdom who voted for Leave still think Dominic Cummings should resign.
[02:22:43.672 --> 02:22:56.000]  So this is the end result, the consequence of a massive, overblown, hypocritical witch hunt fostered once again by the lying media, by the hashtag media scum,
[02:22:57.324 --> 02:23:01.748]  But again, the majority of people have gone along with it, even though the facts speak for themselves.
[02:23:01.788 --> 02:23:05.571]  He was simply trying to find urgent childcare for his four-year-old son.
[02:23:05.591 --> 02:23:08.453]  We'll get back into it and other stories on the other side.
[02:23:08.573 --> 02:23:09.814]  Summit.News, don't go away.
[02:23:10.795 --> 02:23:19.723]  So the United Kingdom continues to be embroiled in this complete non-scandal about Dominic Cummings, an advisor to the Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who
[02:23:20.600 --> 02:23:29.789]  ...committed the absolute sin of trying to find his child urgent child care when he and his wife fell ill potentially of coronavirus back in March.
[02:23:30.757 --> 02:23:32.478]  Turns out he didn't even break the law.
[02:23:32.979 --> 02:23:38.722]  Unlike Professor Pantsdown, who broke the law to go and shag a married woman in London.
[02:23:39.083 --> 02:23:46.548]  There's no proviso, there's no exemption for having sex with a married woman in the lockdown law that I've seen.
[02:23:46.568 --> 02:23:48.869]  Now what there is an exemption for is this.
[02:23:48.969 --> 02:23:51.111]  The lockdown law in this country says, quote,
[02:23:52.566 --> 02:23:56.667]  If you have children, keep following this advice to the best of your ability.
[02:23:56.787 --> 02:24:00.549]  However, we are aware that not all these measures will be possible.
[02:24:00.669 --> 02:24:03.110]  And in the case of Dominic Cummings, that was not possible.
[02:24:03.470 --> 02:24:16.174]  That's why he had to drive to the north of the country, where his parents lived, to hand over his child so they could care for him, because there was a very real possibility that either he, his wife, or both of them would have ended up in hospital.
[02:24:16.594 --> 02:24:17.474]  That's why he did it.
[02:24:17.534 --> 02:24:21.856]  He gave a big press conference yesterday explaining this, but they still want blood.
[02:24:22.538 --> 02:24:34.525]  The reason why media scum is still trending today, along with scum media on Twitter, at least the UK Twitter, is because this harassment campaign has been led by the media.
[02:24:35.106 --> 02:24:47.593]  To the point where they're now going up to the residence of his parents, even though he's not there anymore, ringing the bell on his elderly parents' home to try and get them to come out and to try and harass them.
[02:24:48.226 --> 02:24:55.310]  This is another example of media-generated hysteria and harassment, and it shows no signs of ending.
[02:24:56.290 --> 02:24:58.512]  Now, why is he under the spotlight?
[02:24:58.532 --> 02:24:59.952]  It has nothing to do with COVID-19.
[02:25:00.192 --> 02:25:12.039]  There you see the Sky News journalist trying to harass his elderly parents at the home in Durham, even though Cummings himself, Dominic Cummings, is not even there anymore.
[02:25:12.899 --> 02:25:14.200]  David Atherton tweets
[02:25:15.425 --> 02:25:17.947]  Civil service coup to keep us in the EU.
[02:25:18.367 --> 02:25:23.170]  When Boris was hospitalised Sir Mark Sedwell tried to extend the transition period.
[02:25:23.610 --> 02:25:25.071]  Cummings stopped him.
[02:25:25.091 --> 02:25:27.533]  There's also an article here out of Breitbart.
[02:25:28.033 --> 02:25:28.513]  Barrage!
[02:25:28.573 --> 02:25:40.961]  Remainers want Cummings out as an excuse to delay Brexit because all along the line Cummings has steadfastly held his position when it comes to refusing to extend that deadline when it comes to Brexit.
[02:25:41.481 --> 02:25:42.442]  Of course we had that
[02:25:43.385 --> 02:25:52.298]  Big event back on January 31st where we left the EU or at least entered into the stages of pulling out of the EU, the transition period as it were.
[02:25:52.618 --> 02:25:58.507]  They want to extend the transition period because they still think they can cancel it after
[02:25:58.507 --> 02:26:01.629]  After four years they still think they can cancel it.
[02:26:01.970 --> 02:26:13.899]  Just as you in the United States have had a four-year war on democracy with people trying to unseat Donald Trump, they've been trying to reverse the democratic will of the British people when it comes to Brexit for the past four years.
[02:26:14.379 --> 02:26:24.007]  Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has said that Remainers want the Prime Minister's advisor Dominic Cummings fired in order to have an excuse to extend the transition period.
[02:26:24.605 --> 02:26:36.334]  He said, it is clear that there are many, not all, but many in the Remain camp, particularly, who would like to see the back of him, who think Cummings going now may well aid them in getting us to extend beyond the end of this year.
[02:26:37.075 --> 02:26:38.096]  Now, you look at the polls.
[02:26:39.337 --> 02:26:45.742]  RT reports Boris Johnson's approval rating plummets by 20 points after refusing to sack Cummings for lockdown breaches.
[02:26:46.262 --> 02:26:48.244]  Again, it's all political.
[02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:52.884]  And then you can contrast it with this story up on Summit News.
[02:26:52.984 --> 02:27:08.540]  Now bear in mind I was just talking about Cummings' neighbours where he lives in North London, protesters who turned up outside his house where his wife and kids are with placards viciously, hatefully screaming at him every single day.
[02:27:10.583 --> 02:27:12.284]  Then we contrast it with this headline.
[02:27:12.304 --> 02:27:17.687]  Leftist Guardian writer tweets desire to physically attack Conservative MP in front of his children.
[02:27:18.188 --> 02:27:28.074]  A leftist podcaster who writes for The Guardian, which is of course the big left-wing newspaper in Britain, has tweeted his desire to physically attack a Conservative MP in front of his children.
[02:27:28.843 --> 02:27:31.565]  Yes, it's not enough to violently assault somebody.
[02:27:31.845 --> 02:27:33.406]  Their kids have to be watching.
[02:27:33.766 --> 02:27:35.568]  These are the tolerant people.
[02:27:35.908 --> 02:27:36.969]  These are the nice people.
[02:27:37.009 --> 02:27:37.949]  Hashtag be kind.
[02:27:38.310 --> 02:27:49.077]  These are the people who whine all day about bullying, harassment and hate when they prove time and time again to be the most hateful people on the planet.
[02:27:49.497 --> 02:27:50.318]  Andy Dawson
[02:27:51.354 --> 02:27:57.238]  So Michael Gove MP, again a Conservative Party MP, goes on the media this morning to defend Dominic Cummings.
[02:27:57.258 --> 02:28:03.021]  His wife tweets this in regard to the protests against Cummings outside his house.
[02:28:14.048 --> 02:28:23.090]  As someone who has been followed and insulted in the street in front of my own children, I would say that this is a classic example of what happens when a Twitter mob spills into real life.
[02:28:23.551 --> 02:28:25.491]  Terrifying and disproportionate.
[02:28:25.971 --> 02:28:33.493]  Because of course the Twitter cancellation mob outrage brigades don't just exist online, they now exist in real life.
[02:28:33.893 --> 02:28:36.194]  We saw another example, in fact multiple,
[02:28:37.225 --> 02:28:55.634]  With Rhys Mogg, another Conservative MP who again was confronted by these snarling leftist hate mobs outside his house in front of his children to the point where they were cussing at Rhys Mogg and his children, insulting their father as they almost cried in front of the media.
[02:28:55.674 --> 02:28:57.475]  The media had nothing much to say about that.
[02:28:59.016 --> 02:29:02.758]  So he responded to the wife of Michael Gove MP who was defending Cummings.
[02:29:04.386 --> 02:29:05.847]  And this is what he said.
[02:29:05.927 --> 02:29:09.848]  He's deleted his account now, by the way, because he couldn't face the backlash.
[02:29:10.609 --> 02:29:11.969]  He said, quote, Again,
[02:29:34.864 --> 02:29:36.104]  So much for the tolerant left.
[02:29:37.065 --> 02:29:46.609]  So this guy, who is a big leftist, was responding to the wife of a Conservative MP by saying, I want to beat you up in the street and I want your kids to watch it.
[02:29:47.089 --> 02:29:48.069]  Send tweet.
[02:29:48.669 --> 02:29:49.970]  He thought that was a good idea.
[02:29:50.470 --> 02:29:54.872]  Dawson locked down his Twitter account soon after he started receiving backlash for the tweet.
[02:29:56.372 --> 02:29:58.173]  Chris Tomlinson of Breitbart tweeted,
[02:29:59.116 --> 02:30:04.740]  Verified leftist Andy Dawson, a writer for The Guardian, The Daily Mirror, not only advocates for political violence, i.e.
[02:30:04.780 --> 02:30:09.164]  terrorism against a sitting cabinet minister, he's willing to finance it as well.
[02:30:09.284 --> 02:30:11.966]  Exactly what democracy is left in the UK.
[02:30:13.163 --> 02:30:29.618]  As I write in the article, it also highlights the two-tier system operated by social media giants like Twitter, which routinely bans Conservatives for their opinions, yet allows clear threats of violence, even against elected Members of Parliament, to go unpunished.
[02:30:30.578 --> 02:30:48.315]  As I spoke about a couple of weeks ago on this show, after Rand Paul went up against Dr Fauci in what was not even really a cantankerous confrontation, it was merely Rand Paul asking him a question and questioning why he should be the supreme authority on coronavirus.
[02:30:49.637 --> 02:30:50.758]  On Twitter within an hour,
[02:30:51.690 --> 02:30:57.493]  There were people saying, I'm hashtag RandPaul's Neighbour, they were talking about RandPaul's Neighbour, celebrating RandPaul's Neighbour.
[02:30:57.933 --> 02:31:06.578]  RandPaul's Neighbour violently attacked RandPaul from behind, leaving him having to have part of his lung removed.
[02:31:07.098 --> 02:31:11.220]  At one stage he was very, very seriously ill in hospital.
[02:31:11.980 --> 02:31:16.643]  They got on Twitter, they celebrated it from what I saw, nobody was banned for that.
[02:31:17.296 --> 02:31:32.192]  Within three hours of this leftist expressing his will to violently attack an elected Member of Parliament in front of his children, nothing whatsoever had happened to his verified Twitter account and he later deleted it himself.
[02:31:32.533 --> 02:31:33.714]  So that's what we're dealing with.
[02:31:34.114 --> 02:31:39.300]  Hateful, mob-outraged leftists whipped up, ginned up by the hysterical
[02:31:40.040 --> 02:31:43.783]  I notice that the hashtag Black Lives Matter is trending once again.
[02:31:43.803 --> 02:31:48.226]  That's partly in relation to this story and one other regarding police brutality.
[02:31:49.106 --> 02:31:58.773]  We're going to play this video here in a second, but there's a headline out of Sky News describing part of what happened, because as we'll see, the media doesn't have both sides of the story.
[02:31:59.313 --> 02:32:00.774]  Headline, Sky News.
[02:32:01.455 --> 02:32:05.838]  Woman sorry for calling police after black man asked her to put dog on leash.
[02:32:06.556 --> 02:32:11.740]  The woman in the video has denied being racist and says she humbly and fully apologizes for her actions.
[02:32:12.380 --> 02:32:19.345]  The video of a white woman calling police after a row with a black man who asked her to put her dog on a leash has gone viral.
[02:32:20.045 --> 02:32:33.855]  When this clip was uploaded yesterday to Twitter, the headline was this, or the text accompanying the video, posted by the sister of the African-American man involved in the confrontation in Central Park, said this,
[02:32:34.953 --> 02:32:44.280]  Oh, and Karen's take a walk with their dogs off leash in the famous Bramble in New York's Central Park, where it's clearly posted on signs that dogs must be leashed at all times.
[02:32:45.181 --> 02:32:50.465]  And someone like my brother, an avid birder, politely asks her to put her dog on the leash.
[02:32:51.337 --> 02:33:10.463]  Now, from what you will see in this video, you will be in no doubt as to who is the villain of the piece, and it's clearly the mask-wearing Karen woman, who not only appears to be racist towards the African-American man, appears to basically try and get him swatted by the police, but also almost succeeds in strangling her own dog.
[02:33:11.161 --> 02:33:18.507]  And there's no doubt that she is indeed a villain, but as I'll get onto in a second, there are two villains involved in this script.
[02:33:18.587 --> 02:33:23.410]  Now let's go to the one-minute video of this confrontation in Central Park, New York.
[02:33:23.430 --> 02:33:23.851]  Here it is.
[02:33:27.634 --> 02:33:28.314]  Would you please stop?
[02:33:29.235 --> 02:33:30.216]  Sir, I'm asking you to stop.
[02:33:30.856 --> 02:33:31.877]  Please don't come close to me.
[02:33:32.457 --> 02:33:33.878]  Sir, I'm asking you to stop recording me.
[02:33:33.938 --> 02:33:34.939]  Please don't come close to me.
[02:33:35.019 --> 02:33:35.860]  Please take your phone off me.
[02:33:35.880 --> 02:33:36.961]  Please don't come close to me.
[02:33:36.981 --> 02:33:38.122]  And I'm taking pictures calling the cops.
[02:33:38.302 --> 02:33:39.343]  Please, please call the cops.
[02:33:40.342 --> 02:33:41.283]  Please call the cops.
[02:33:41.883 --> 02:33:44.285]  I'm gonna tell them there's an African-American man threatening my life.
[02:33:44.565 --> 02:33:45.806]  Please tell them whatever you like!
[02:33:45.826 --> 02:33:50.129]  Excuse me?
[02:33:58.375 --> 02:34:07.121]  I'm sorry, I'm in the Ramble, and there is a man, African-American, he has a bicycle helmet, he is recording me and threatening me and my dog.
[02:34:09.932 --> 02:34:11.393]  There is an African American man.
[02:34:11.413 --> 02:34:12.553]  I am in Central Park.
[02:34:12.993 --> 02:34:15.614]  He is recording me and threatening myself and my dog.
[02:34:18.035 --> 02:34:22.297]  I'm sorry, I can't hear you either.
[02:34:22.777 --> 02:34:24.718]  I'm being threatened by a man into the ramble.
[02:34:24.978 --> 02:34:26.499]  Please send the cops immediately.
[02:34:26.519 --> 02:34:30.180]  I'm in Central Park in the ramble.
[02:34:30.500 --> 02:34:31.160]  I don't know.
[02:34:32.301 --> 02:34:32.681]  Thank you.
[02:34:36.075 --> 02:34:44.080]  So as you can see from that clip, and if you were just listening to that with the audio, by the end of the clip she's basically almost strangling her dog to death.
[02:34:44.540 --> 02:34:50.044]  She's since been put on administrative leave from her financial job and her dog has indeed been taken.
[02:34:50.064 --> 02:34:54.607]  And of course, if you base your judgment on only what's in that clip,
[02:34:55.251 --> 02:35:14.951]  You will think that there's only one villain of the piece that she's calling the cops immediately on a whim because she's quote being threatened even though there's no evidence in the video of her being threatened and of course the fact that she said it's an African-American man has immediately been taken as proof that she's racist
[02:35:15.974 --> 02:35:16.594]  We're good to go.
[02:35:46.235 --> 02:35:49.297]  You could side with the person filming the video.
[02:35:49.357 --> 02:35:51.758]  It was his sister who later posted it to Twitter.
[02:35:52.318 --> 02:35:54.940]  And indeed, media reporting does exactly that.
[02:35:55.540 --> 02:36:02.684]  Continuing with the Sky News article, there's a video of a white woman calling police after a row with a black man who asked her to put a dog on a leash has gone viral.
[02:36:03.024 --> 02:36:08.386]  Christian Cooper said he was birdwatching in a woodland area of New York's Central Park when the argument began.
[02:36:08.907 --> 02:36:15.050]  Mr. Cooper, a former Marvel Comics editor, filmed part of the altercation with the woman who has now been suspended from her job.
[02:36:16.101 --> 02:36:17.782]  She tells him to stop recording.
[02:36:18.343 --> 02:36:29.172]  So the entire premise of the narrative is that the woman is lying by claiming the man threatened her when all he did was ask her to put her dog on a leash.
[02:36:29.892 --> 02:36:34.075]  So the narrative is this mask-wearing Karen has gone completely over the top.
[02:36:34.356 --> 02:36:35.116]  She's racist.
[02:36:35.156 --> 02:36:44.524]  She's putting the man's life at risk, describing him as African-American, presumably to make him sound more scary to the police because she's this horrible racist.
[02:36:46.180 --> 02:36:49.283]  30 million views on Twitter with that narrative.
[02:36:49.804 --> 02:36:57.250]  Turns out the guy in the clip was threatening her, but you don't get to see that part of the interaction.
[02:36:57.731 --> 02:37:04.937]  And my source for that is the guy himself, because he posted this to Facebook immediately after the incident.
[02:37:05.497 --> 02:37:09.441]  And this was tweeted by Jack Posobiec just a couple of hours ago.
[02:37:11.078 --> 02:37:22.790]  This is from the guy filming the video involved in the confrontation with the woman, who again has cut off the part of it to make her look like a liar in claiming that he was threatening her when he wasn't.
[02:37:22.830 --> 02:37:25.613]  But this is what he said on Facebook.
[02:37:26.133 --> 02:37:27.175]  Christian Cooper.
[02:37:27.815 --> 02:37:29.137]  Central Park this morning.
[02:37:29.437 --> 02:37:32.360]  This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.
[02:37:33.098 --> 02:37:33.338]  Me.
[02:37:33.938 --> 02:37:36.739]  Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times.
[02:37:36.779 --> 02:37:37.899]  The sign is right there.
[02:37:38.380 --> 02:37:38.700]  Her.
[02:37:39.240 --> 02:37:40.360]  The dog runs are closed.
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:41.600]  He needs his exercise.
[02:37:41.761 --> 02:37:41.961]  Me.
[02:37:42.881 --> 02:37:48.142]  All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.
[02:37:48.663 --> 02:37:48.923]  Her.
[02:37:49.063 --> 02:37:49.883]  It's too dangerous.
[02:37:50.003 --> 02:37:50.223]  Me.
[02:37:50.883 --> 02:37:58.225]  Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.
[02:37:59.146 --> 02:37:59.466]  Her.
[02:37:59.926 --> 02:38:00.446]  What's that?
[02:38:01.286 --> 02:38:03.728]  Me, to the dog, come here puppy.
[02:38:04.448 --> 02:38:05.749]  Her, he won't come to you.
[02:38:06.309 --> 02:38:07.951]  Me, we'll see about that.
[02:38:08.691 --> 02:38:11.773]  I pull out the dog treats I carry for just such intransigence.
[02:38:12.153 --> 02:38:16.857]  I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.
[02:38:17.357 --> 02:38:18.778]  Her, don't you touch my dog.
[02:38:19.138 --> 02:38:21.940]  That's when I started recording the video.
[02:38:22.320 --> 02:38:27.644]  So again, before the recording began, this guy said to the woman,
[02:38:28.391 --> 02:38:34.533]  If you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.
[02:38:34.933 --> 02:38:36.613]  And then he calls over the dog.
[02:38:37.273 --> 02:38:44.115]  Now, to any reasonable person, that is an implicit threat of harm to the woman's dog.
[02:38:44.455 --> 02:38:47.856]  Whether he was actually going to do anything to the dog, nobody knows.
[02:38:48.217 --> 02:38:50.377]  But that is a threat towards the woman's dog.
[02:38:50.417 --> 02:38:53.378]  If somebody came up to your dog and started threatening to do something to it,
[02:38:54.306 --> 02:38:56.347]  You probably wouldn't have the best reaction either.
[02:38:56.908 --> 02:39:00.990]  So both individuals in this clip are Karens.
[02:39:01.751 --> 02:39:10.055]  This mask-wearing woman who's freaking out, strangling her own dog, calling the police on the guy, trying to escalate the confrontation immediately.
[02:39:10.516 --> 02:39:19.021]  She's bad and so is the guy for leaving out the recording or misrepresenting what happened by leaving out the recording
[02:39:19.713 --> 02:39:21.394]  before he uploaded it to Twitter.
[02:39:21.875 --> 02:39:31.203]  He should have described what happened in the text of the video on Twitter, but he didn't, and that completely changed the narrative of the story.
[02:39:31.823 --> 02:39:45.975]  Of course, people have pointed out in the aftermath, last week we had an African-American male viciously beating an elderly white man and viciously beating an elderly woman in a care home in Detroit
[02:39:46.593 --> 02:40:07.087]  And it got basically 2% of the media coverage that this story out of New York is getting today, despite the fact that if you watch the video, and we highlighted it on the show last week, of the African American male beating the elderly white people, it was even more disturbing than that confrontation in Central Park.
[02:40:07.774 --> 02:40:11.337]  That didn't get 30 million views, the Central Park video did.
[02:40:11.677 --> 02:40:22.467]  That didn't get 2% of the media coverage that the Central Park incident is getting today, trending all over Twitter, even though it's been completely misrepresented.
[02:40:22.887 --> 02:40:35.198]  So yeah, another media hoax ginned up by hysteria as an exploitative move to again cause race divisions in the United States in the aftermath of, of course, the killing
[02:40:36.315 --> 02:40:38.858]  Of Mr. Jogger Omoed Obrey.
[02:40:39.098 --> 02:40:48.827]  With many media outlets going completely bust this week and last week, serves as a reminder that your great support continues to allow us to thrive and build here.

[02:41:53.046 --> 02:42:01.693]  Now, we had the mask Karen in the previous segment with the incident in Central Park, which turned out to be a tale of two Karens, but the media's not going to tell you that.
[02:42:02.253 --> 02:42:03.494]  We had this story yesterday.
[02:42:04.175 --> 02:42:04.635]  Video.
[02:42:04.916 --> 02:42:08.719]  Woman driven out of grocery store by angry mob for not wearing a mask.
[02:42:09.379 --> 02:42:13.443]  Yes, the high priest class of mask wearers strikes again.
[02:42:14.372 --> 02:42:19.979]  Video footage out of Staten Island shows a woman being driven out of a grocery store by an angry mob because she's not wearing a mask.
[02:42:20.500 --> 02:42:23.964]  The clip shows the woman surrounded by the shoppers as they yell and cuss at her.
[02:42:24.665 --> 02:42:25.746]  Get the F out of here!
[02:42:25.786 --> 02:42:26.166]  Get out!
[02:42:26.187 --> 02:42:28.770]  The crowd screams at the woman while pointing towards the exit.
[02:42:29.791 --> 02:42:31.133]  And if you read the comments...
[02:42:32.028 --> 02:42:37.130]  Below this video on Twitter, most of them supported the angry mob.
[02:42:37.730 --> 02:42:48.974]  So once again, this mask, which at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic they said, don't wear a mask because it doesn't do anything and you're depriving doctors and nurses of PPE.
[02:42:49.374 --> 02:42:52.455]  So people who wear masks are bad, they're evil.
[02:42:53.096 --> 02:42:59.618]  Now they're saying if you don't wear a mask, that means you're evil because you're not a good little obedient slave.
[02:43:00.350 --> 02:43:07.092]  So now they're literally hounding people out of grocery stores in New York, having formed into giant mobs.
[02:43:07.572 --> 02:43:11.993]  Maybe they should ask to be paid for it, because that's what's about to happen in Italy.
[02:43:13.093 --> 02:43:17.334]  Headline, Italian government wants unemployed to become social distancing snitches.
[02:43:18.274 --> 02:43:22.775]  The Italian government announced intention Sunday to create an army of social distancing snitches.
[02:43:23.433 --> 02:43:32.079]  Saying it will recruit 60,000 Karens to monitor their friends' and neighbours' activities and make sure they are adhering to social distancing policies.
[02:43:32.860 --> 02:43:38.904]  Reports indicate the government will reach out especially to the unemployed for the roles, in particular those who have applied for benefits recently.
[02:43:40.023 --> 02:43:56.886]  So again, just as in the United States, mass unemployment caused by the lockdown, then they fill in the gaps by creating tens of thousands of Stasi-like spies for the state, who will snitch on you, who will grass you up if you don't properly engage in social distancing.
[02:43:57.346 --> 02:44:05.807]  Which of course, if you look at many of the studies, proves that the lockdown, that social distancing, didn't really have an effect on coronavirus deaths.
[02:44:06.228 --> 02:44:08.788]  But that doesn't matter because this is very lucrative,
[02:44:09.594 --> 02:44:10.334]  For Big Brother.
[02:44:10.774 --> 02:44:18.936]  It wants people to become civic assistants who will report infractions on the use of face masks and other state-ordered rules in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown.
[02:44:19.336 --> 02:44:26.557]  The informants will not be given uniforms or badges and will simply be embedded within the population, meaning anyone could be a government snitch.
[02:44:27.038 --> 02:44:32.279]  Just like in East Germany, it could be your friend, it could be your neighbour.
[02:44:32.899 --> 02:44:36.959]  Meanwhile, IKEA to employ social distancing wardens to patrol shoppers.
[02:44:38.320 --> 02:44:39.060]  This is in the UK.
[02:44:40.183 --> 02:44:47.287]  IKEA is set to employ social distance wardens who tell people how to behave in stores as a whole new jobs market for Karen's is created.
[02:44:47.307 --> 02:44:52.749]  The Swedish furniture giant announced today that it would open 19 of its stores across the UK on June 1st.
[02:44:53.550 --> 02:44:58.172]  However, families hoping to make a day of visiting the store can forget about it.
[02:44:58.252 --> 02:45:01.053]  Only one adult and one child per household is allowed.
[02:45:01.674 --> 02:45:07.897]  So again, they're exploiting these stupid social distancing rules to ensure families can't have days out.
[02:45:08.655 --> 02:45:17.317]  Then it says, other measures to ensure safer trading during the coronavirus outbreak include social distance wardens to help shoppers navigate a new one-way system.
[02:45:18.258 --> 02:45:28.021]  So again, get ready for ethnic minority minimum wage slaves imported as cheap labour to bark orders at you and your family as you shop.
[02:45:28.361 --> 02:45:29.321]  Can't wait!
[02:45:31.562 --> 02:45:37.184]  Meanwhile, psychiatrists wrote 86% more prescriptions for psychotropic drugs during lockdown months.
[02:45:37.784 --> 02:45:44.946]  Again, this gets to the heart of this massive mental health problem that we won't feel the full effects for for years to come.
[02:45:45.506 --> 02:45:55.329]  Psychiatrists wrote 86% more prescriptions for psychotropic drugs, including antidepressants, during the lockdown months of March and April compared to January and February.
[02:45:56.488 --> 02:46:04.029]  Prescriptions for anti-anxiety medications and sleep aids have risen during the pandemic, reports the Wall Street Journal.
[02:46:04.510 --> 02:46:23.133]  So, big hike in prescriptions of antidepressants, which of course have a number of side effects which aren't necessarily great, but again it illustrates how this has been terrible for people's mental health and on that very subject, California hospital records more suicides than coronavirus deaths during lockdown.
[02:46:24.218 --> 02:46:28.321]  This is John Muir Medical Center in Walnut Creek, California.
[02:46:29.201 --> 02:46:37.147]  Doctors say they've recorded more deaths from suicide than coronavirus, with a year's worth of suicides and suicide attempts being recorded in a four-week period.
[02:46:37.987 --> 02:46:49.775]  All the nurses and doctors at this hospital are trying to blow the whistle, calling for the lockdown to be fully lifted, because more people have died from suicide than coronavirus itself.
[02:46:50.635 --> 02:46:51.516]  And related to that,
[02:46:52.776 --> 02:46:56.597]  There's another headline here which I just put up on Summit News a couple of hours ago.
[02:46:57.097 --> 02:47:01.778]  Study lockdown will destroy at least seven times more years of human life than it saves.
[02:47:02.579 --> 02:47:12.782]  Once again, the lockdown claiming more lives than all the social distancing, the coronavirus, the social distancing causing more deaths than the coronavirus itself.
[02:47:12.842 --> 02:47:14.382]  Then what was the point?
[02:47:15.185 --> 02:47:27.195]  A study has found that the stay-at-home lockdown order in the United States will, quote, destroy at least seven times more years of human life than it saves, and that this number is likely to be more than 90 times greater.
[02:47:27.936 --> 02:47:28.196]  Why?
[02:47:28.336 --> 02:47:34.582]  Well, because of debilitating stress, anxiety, job losses, untreated illnesses.
[02:47:35.282 --> 02:47:37.044]  Remember, I've talked about this many times.
[02:47:37.782 --> 02:47:44.584]  The Professor of Cancer at King's College is predicting at least 50,000 cancer deaths in the UK.
[02:47:44.944 --> 02:47:50.425]  Cancer deaths alone, excess cancer deaths, because people were unable to get treatment.
[02:47:50.465 --> 02:47:54.406]  That's more deaths than people have died from coronavirus in the UK so far.
[02:47:55.147 --> 02:47:56.307]  That's not even including
[02:47:57.290 --> 02:48:10.053]  The 1.4 million global tuberculosis deaths that experts say are now going to happen again because people couldn't get treatment, because the hospitals were all devoted to coronavirus.
[02:48:10.353 --> 02:48:16.935]  We couldn't overwhelm the hospitals while all the nurses were dancing on TikTok, because that's very important.
[02:48:18.535 --> 02:48:23.276]  Meanwhile in Sweden, we talked about this last week, there's been a development
[02:48:24.167 --> 02:48:29.851]  Father of Swedish man killed by migrant, forced by media to defend his dead son from Nazi smears.
[02:48:30.972 --> 02:48:38.157]  So we had the initial story, which was a Swedish man who was killed by a Sudanese migrant while trying to prevent a woman being raped.
[02:48:39.818 --> 02:48:43.100]  And now his father is being harassed by the media.
[02:48:43.361 --> 02:48:51.046]  They're not asking questions about why Sweden has a massive problem with violent crime, why Sweden has a massive problem with rape.
[02:48:51.747 --> 02:48:59.954]  No, they're going to the house of the father of the victim who was murdered by the migrant to ask him, was your son a Nazi?
[02:49:00.595 --> 02:49:10.324]  As we previously highlighted, Tommy Lind was stabbed to death while trying to stop the assault after a group of migrants crashed a house party in Hornos and uninvited.
[02:49:10.924 --> 02:49:13.967]  After killing Lind, the migrant continued to rape the woman.
[02:49:14.594 --> 02:49:29.257]  He was later named as 22-year-old Abu Bakr Mohammed, a Sudanese migrant who was granted Swedish citizenship in 2011 and had a long criminal record, including a 2015 conviction of raping a girl under the age of 15.
[02:49:29.418 --> 02:49:35.359]  Why on earth was he out on the streets when he'd been convicted of raping a girl less than five years ago?
[02:49:36.439 --> 02:49:43.201]  Following the murder, a right-wing group staged a protest in Hornos and, of course, the media was more outraged about that.
[02:49:43.301 --> 02:49:43.901]  How dare they?
[02:49:44.716 --> 02:49:45.477]  against the killing.
[02:49:46.517 --> 02:49:49.780]  But the demonstrators were immediately smeared as Nazis by the media.
[02:49:50.180 --> 02:49:51.481]  But that wasn't enough.
[02:49:52.142 --> 02:50:10.375]  Swedish public broadcaster SVT, which dutifully amplified the Nazi narrative, then paid a visit to the home of Lin's father after he'd been stabbed to death by a migrant for trying to stop a woman being raped, where his father was forced to defend his dead son against accusations he was racist.
[02:50:11.072 --> 02:50:14.814]  As the article makes clear, the father was grilled about why his son had a shaved head.
[02:50:15.554 --> 02:50:23.459]  As he insisted, Lynn was not a Nazi, but may have had friends who sympathised with the Nordic resistance movement, the group that staged the protest.
[02:50:23.819 --> 02:50:33.364]  So they were more interested in the victim's political leanings than reporting on the fact that he was killed by a migrant while trying to stop a woman being raped.
[02:50:34.024 --> 02:50:34.905]  Is it any surprise
[02:50:35.618 --> 02:50:52.948]  That parties like the one Lynd the victim supported, Alternative for Sweden, and Sweden Democrats, which is the other populist party, are doing better and better in Sweden, which of course has become notorious for its rampant problems with violent crime as a result of mass immigration.
[02:50:53.308 --> 02:50:53.969]  I'm going to wrap it up.
[02:50:54.009 --> 02:50:55.450]  Coming up, War Room with Owen Troyer.
[02:50:56.050 --> 02:50:56.851]  Infowars.com.

[02:51:09.375 --> 02:51:12.637]  We told you what was going to happen and it did.
[02:51:13.097 --> 02:51:15.398]  Now we're telling you what's coming.
[02:51:15.458 --> 02:51:16.199]  What's coming.
[02:51:17.019 --> 02:51:17.460]  Band.
[02:51:18.860 --> 02:51:19.401]  Video.
[02:51:23.863 --> 02:51:26.705]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the Info War!
[02:51:32.441 --> 02:51:34.601]  Alex Jones here with the bad news up front.
[02:51:35.382 --> 02:51:37.082]  We are sold out of Pollen Block.

[02:52:16.915 --> 02:52:32.630]  50% off for brain force plus that great nootropic bio true selenium 60% off shill force is 60% off and you really need to try that now we're continuing the big mega sale on these other items but they will have to end right after
[02:52:33.717 --> 02:52:36.139]  Memorial Day, because a bunch of these are going to sell as well.

[02:52:48.473 --> 02:52:49.013]  Near this.
[02:52:49.574 --> 02:52:51.315]  This is an amazing deal, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:52:51.355 --> 02:52:52.456]  Almost no markup there.
[02:52:52.856 --> 02:52:56.818]  They are just dumping these on the market to us, because they're Patriots, and they're about to make another big order.
[02:52:56.858 --> 02:53:01.221]  So, a lot of inside baseball, but this is the best deal ever on the Lexus Pure Breeze.
[02:53:01.241 --> 02:53:04.123]  8-pack PowerStack, at cost, 70% off.
[02:53:04.203 --> 02:53:05.864]  The best deal, hands down.
[02:53:05.924 --> 02:53:08.346]  DNA Force Plus, the number one thing you should be taking.
[02:53:09.967 --> 02:53:11.948]  50% off the PQQ, the CoQ10, so much more.
[02:53:12.228 --> 02:53:13.069]  Really strong formula.
[02:53:13.089 --> 02:53:17.492]  It's amazing how it cleans out your mitochondria, makes your telomeres last longer, and a lot more.
[02:53:17.512 --> 02:53:17.932]  Look into that.
[02:53:18.632 --> 02:53:18.792]  50% off.

[02:53:23.834 --> 02:53:24.174]  I love it.
[02:53:24.474 --> 02:53:25.214]  It's a game changer.
[02:53:25.234 --> 02:53:26.075]  50% off.
[02:53:26.375 --> 02:53:28.075]  Limited edition InfoWars face mask.
[02:53:28.135 --> 02:53:30.936]  Look, my wife had to go up and visit her dad who's sick.
[02:53:32.017 --> 02:53:33.857]  They made her wear a mask, so she wore an InfoWars mask.
[02:53:34.078 --> 02:53:35.138]  Yeah, it's the new Sharia law.
[02:53:35.178 --> 02:53:38.539]  It's a sign that you're under the yoke of Bill Gates, that you are his bond slave.
[02:53:38.879 --> 02:53:40.380]  Literally, that you're under the medical tyranny.
[02:53:40.400 --> 02:53:40.520]  But
[02:53:41.886 --> 02:53:45.629]  You gotta find a plan, you gotta do it, then fight back with InfoWars in their face.
[02:53:45.689 --> 02:53:46.730]  Turn it against them.
[02:53:47.030 --> 02:53:48.111]  Those are $9.95.
[02:53:48.171 --> 02:53:50.333]  TurboForce, the amazing 10-hour clean energy.
[02:53:50.793 --> 02:53:51.814]  That is 40% off.
[02:53:52.034 --> 02:53:53.715]  TurboFood, now available again as well.
[02:53:54.116 --> 02:53:55.657]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:53:56.057 --> 02:53:58.359]  And so, part of the sale is in it because stuff sold out.
[02:53:58.739 --> 02:54:01.181]  Other stuff's about to end because it's about to sell out while supplies last.
[02:54:01.502 --> 02:54:03.984]  But a lot of new items that were out are now back in stock.
[02:54:04.524 --> 02:54:05.465]  So this is a $3.60 win.
[02:54:05.545 --> 02:54:06.586]  It funds the InfoWars.
[02:54:06.926 --> 02:54:08.587]  These are amazing products.
[02:54:08.607 --> 02:54:09.388]  That's why people love them.
[02:54:09.448 --> 02:54:18.835]  That's why they get thousands and thousands of five-star reviews on Powell Reviews and other third-party independent sites, because we go out and take our knowledge and get the very best supplements there are.
[02:54:19.095 --> 02:54:24.980]  And a lot of the products we have are essential, meaning if you don't have these things, well, it's essential, like oxygen or water.
[02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:34.146]  And so much of the food has been debased because of the soils being debased, not having the trace minerals and the elements you need, that supplementation is absolutely key.
[02:54:34.467 --> 02:54:35.628]  So you're funding the info war.
[02:54:36.391 --> 02:54:47.454]  You're getting amazing products at the best prices out there, and you're really putting your thumb in the eye of the globalists who wanted us shut down a long time ago before they launched this globalist takeover that we're now witnessing.
[02:54:47.814 --> 02:54:51.115]  So again, take advantage of the Memorial Day Special.
[02:54:51.355 --> 02:54:55.176]  It's the big sale that's ending, and it's new items that came in on sale as well.
[02:54:55.596 --> 02:54:58.837]  Biggest sale so far this year, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:54:59.137 --> 02:55:01.958]  We're call toll free, we can answer all your questions, take your order, 888-253-3139.

[02:55:06.139 --> 02:55:11.987]  We are putting free stickers inside all of the shipments so you can help spread the word that way.
[02:55:12.407 --> 02:55:18.755]  Please don't underestimate the power you have when you purchase these products to fund the operation, when you spread the word, when you pray for InfoWars.
[02:55:18.995 --> 02:55:20.437]  Thank you all and God bless you.
[02:55:20.577 --> 02:55:21.999]  Now please get out there and spread the word.
[02:55:22.219 --> 02:55:23.381]  You are the modern Paul Revere.
[02:55:30.754 --> 02:55:36.275]  As the pressure to wear masks in public rises, it's important to be able to keep yourself safe while making a statement.
[02:55:37.876 --> 02:55:40.976]  That's why we created a limited edition InfoWars face mask.
[02:55:42.457 --> 02:55:48.758]  The easiest way to stay safe from incoming germs while showing your support for patriotism and freedom in the face of tyranny.
[02:55:50.839 --> 02:55:56.180]  Easy to use, just slip it on on your way to work, the store, or anywhere that mandates a mask around you.
[02:55:59.192 --> 02:56:05.074]  These also make great gifts or purchases for friends, family members, neighbors, or anyone else concerned about their safety in public.
[02:56:06.715 --> 02:56:09.076]  If you must stay safe, you might as well stay stylish.
[02:56:09.596 --> 02:56:13.798]  Get the limited edition InfoWars face mask today at InfoWarsStore.com
[02:56:43.846 --> 02:56:47.108]  When do you think the people should be able to, like, talk again?
[02:56:47.128 --> 02:56:48.708]  The person?
[02:56:48.748 --> 02:56:50.449]  Yeah, that's a good question.
[02:56:51.550 --> 02:56:53.911]  Well, Alex Jones at least has Infowars.com.
[02:56:53.931 --> 02:56:55.832]  He can do his own thing and people go to that.
[02:56:55.892 --> 02:56:57.413]  And Gavin's got a show still.
[02:56:57.453 --> 02:56:57.733]  Does he?
[02:56:57.913 --> 02:56:59.774]  Yeah, you know, as someone who's kind of
[02:57:00.174 --> 02:57:00.654]  I think so.
[02:57:16.485 --> 02:57:18.806]  It doesn't make any sense, because that means you're right all the time.
[02:57:19.247 --> 02:57:23.789]  If you're only defending the things that you believe in, will you write all the time about everything?
[02:57:23.809 --> 02:57:33.315]  But I have to defend the people who say things that are even atrocious and that I would never get on board with, because that's what free speech is.
[02:57:34.496 --> 02:57:39.439]  And like you said, it is that slippery slope of who gets to be the arbiter of what is said.
[02:57:39.659 --> 02:57:41.400]  Right, and what are your guidelines?
[02:57:41.540 --> 02:57:43.581]  Alex Jones is funnier than Andy Kaufman's ever been.
[02:57:44.061 --> 02:57:46.182]  Alex Jones is f***ing hilarious, often.
[02:57:46.302 --> 02:57:48.743]  Did you see the whole that he's Bill Hicks?
[02:57:49.183 --> 02:57:49.443]  No.
[02:57:49.623 --> 02:57:50.184]  Conspiracy?
[02:57:50.224 --> 02:57:50.924]  That's not real.
[02:57:51.364 --> 02:57:52.565]  I went down that rabbit hole.
[02:57:52.585 --> 02:57:53.625]  That's the silliest s*** ever.
[02:57:53.645 --> 02:57:54.926]  I know, but there are videos.
[02:57:55.326 --> 02:58:01.288]  But he had one thing we're talking about, like if it's between his family starving or eating his neighbor.
[02:58:01.448 --> 02:58:03.109]  He's like, I'll eat your ass.
[02:58:03.349 --> 02:58:04.750]  And so it became this giant... Come on.
[02:58:05.643 --> 02:58:07.044]  I will eat your ass!
[02:58:07.144 --> 02:58:09.945]  Do you don't think there's entertainment value in him saying he's going to eat his neighbor?
[02:58:09.965 --> 02:58:10.585]  Stop my dumpster fire!
[02:58:10.966 --> 02:58:11.186]  Right.
[02:58:11.426 --> 02:58:17.389]  But there's something to that, like to stop that and ban that.
[02:58:18.369 --> 02:58:31.575]  You're not stopping anyone from... You're not stopping anybody from anything bad by not having Alex do this entertaining thing about eating his neighbor.
[02:58:31.595 --> 02:58:32.756]  You're not saving anybody.
[02:58:32.816 --> 02:58:33.076]  Yeah.
[02:58:33.216 --> 02:58:34.277]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:58:36.487 --> 02:58:37.508]  Like, what are you doing?
[02:58:37.568 --> 02:58:39.310]  Like, what is he doing that's so awful?
[02:58:39.930 --> 02:58:42.532]  I don't know how to fix any of it.
[02:58:42.833 --> 02:58:43.713]  It's entertaining.
[02:58:44.334 --> 02:58:47.336]  Like, why is it only acceptable if you have some kind of entertainment?
[02:58:47.356 --> 02:58:57.445]  Because there's so many rap videos that you could watch that I enjoy, but they're talking about shooting people and robbing people, and it's everywhere on YouTube!
[02:58:57.525 --> 02:58:58.826]  It's so prevalent!
[02:58:59.106 --> 02:59:00.667]  And somehow or another, that's okay.
[02:59:01.388 --> 02:59:04.731]  Like, it's f***ing weird what's allowed and what's not allowed.
[02:59:10.322 --> 02:59:11.062]  I will!
[02:59:11.082 --> 02:59:12.263]  I will eat your ass!
[02:59:12.383 --> 02:59:17.086]  I will eat your leftist ass like corn on the cob!
[02:59:17.326 --> 02:59:18.187]  I'm ready!
[02:59:18.387 --> 02:59:18.947]  I will eat you!
[02:59:19.288 --> 02:59:20.628]  I will eat your ass!
[02:59:20.668 --> 02:59:21.509]  I will eat your ass!
[02:59:21.569 --> 02:59:23.050]  My children aren't going hungry!
[02:59:23.190 --> 02:59:23.650]  I'll do it!
[02:59:23.870 --> 02:59:25.071]  I'll drink your blood!
[02:59:25.712 --> 02:59:28.733]  And I'm starting to think about having to eat my neighbors!
[02:59:28.934 --> 02:59:29.994]  You think I like?
[02:59:30.034 --> 02:59:32.656]  Size it up, I'm gonna haul him up by a chain!
[02:59:32.676 --> 02:59:36.678]  Top his ass up, size it up, I'm gonna haul him up by a chain!
[02:59:36.758 --> 02:59:37.759]  Top, top, top, top!
[02:59:37.799 --> 02:59:38.720]  Barbecue your ass!
[02:59:41.509 --> 02:59:41.850]  I will.
[02:59:41.950 --> 02:59:43.932]  I'm ready to hang them up.
[03:00:17.637 --> 03:00:17.740]  No.
