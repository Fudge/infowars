[00:00:14.568 --> 00:00:25.072]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are live on this May 26th Tuesday Global Transmission with exactly 160 days out from the incredibly important election.
[00:00:25.072 --> 00:00:33.014]  Well, it's come out that the New York Times put a bunch of fake names of people that died from gunshot wounds, car accidents in their list of 100,000 people that had died.
[00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:37.912]  And now Washington State's been caught doing it again.
[00:00:37.912 --> 00:00:41.433]  Gunshot victims count as coronavirus deaths in Washington State.
[00:00:41.433 --> 00:00:44.594]  The whole thing is a criminal fraud working in unison together.
[00:00:44.594 --> 00:00:47.695]  And the whole facade's starting to crumble.
[00:00:47.695 --> 00:00:57.519]  I'm talking about all the real numbers and real actuaries coming out of big banks and insurance companies in the United States, South Africa, Japan, Europe.
[00:00:58.934 --> 00:01:11.838]  Showing that the lockdowns are a hoax, and that COVID-19 is a hoax, and that everyone dying of other diseases is counted as COVID-19, and is the biggest fraud the planet has ever seen.
[00:01:11.838 --> 00:01:21.242]  Over the course of the next few months, and certainly the year, more people in the world will have died because of the lockdowns than because of the virus.
[00:01:22.364 --> 00:01:22.524]  I don't
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.500]  We live in a different age.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.721]  We do not value freedom because the left is in charge.
[00:01:45.721 --> 00:01:50.962]  The left has never valued freedom, from Marx to the Democratic Party today.
[00:01:50.962 --> 00:01:53.643]  It is simply not, it's not one of their values.
[00:01:53.643 --> 00:01:59.384]  They may believe in equality, they may believe in government, but they do not believe in liberty.
[00:01:59.384 --> 00:02:09.747]  How many people on the left, in their hearts, value the idea, as this is Memorial Day weekend, that people died for liberty?
[00:02:10.754 --> 00:02:13.056]  We're not even prepared to live for liberty.
[00:02:13.056 --> 00:02:18.760]  This is the most serious crisis in American history since the Civil War.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:29.708]  The neuroses and the mental illness that it's manifested is going to take generations to go away unless we all start speaking out against the hoax.
[00:02:29.708 --> 00:02:36.973]  Now there is a real virus that came out of a weapons lab and it has great gain of function so a lot of people get it.
[00:02:36.973 --> 00:02:38.875]  So you can all be suspect.
[00:02:40.325 --> 00:02:49.249]  And so that in test it will match regular coronaviruses, one of the most common forms of death, so they can create fear.
[00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:53.532]  It is a fear weapon.
[00:02:53.532 --> 00:02:54.832]  Period.
[00:02:54.832 --> 00:03:03.497]  Supreme Court of Brazil has ordered a Bolsonaro video to be released from a private cabinet meeting he was having.
[00:03:03.497 --> 00:03:06.958]  And it shows that he's just as real as we all knew he was.
[00:03:06.958 --> 00:03:07.879]  This broadcast
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.424]  And the feet and legs you gave it.
[00:03:10.424 --> 00:03:12.448]  We're in this together.
[00:03:12.448 --> 00:03:17.619]  Has put Bolsonaro, thanks to his incredible courage, and that's brutally stabbed and survived.
[00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:18.521]  The guy is amazing.
[00:03:19.485 --> 00:03:21.886]  And quite frankly, I think more hardcore than Trump.
[00:03:21.886 --> 00:03:22.806]  Listen to this guy.
[00:03:22.806 --> 00:03:26.468]  It was decided not long ago that you couldn't handcuff almost no one.
[00:03:26.468 --> 00:03:31.630]  Why are they putting handcuffs on citizens that's working or a woman in a public square?
[00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:33.671]  You have to effing speak.
[00:03:33.671 --> 00:03:35.772]  You're going to be quiet.
[00:03:35.772 --> 00:03:36.532]  Until when?
[00:03:36.532 --> 00:03:39.753]  Or do I have to keep on exposing this myself?
[00:03:39.753 --> 00:03:40.754]  You have to speak.
[00:03:40.754 --> 00:03:41.354]  Put it out there.
[00:03:41.354 --> 00:03:42.274]  Dish it out.
[00:03:42.274 --> 00:03:45.376]  You can't put handcuffs, a decision, on the Supreme Court itself.
[00:03:46.485 --> 00:03:48.626]  And we're going to be quiet until when?
[00:03:48.626 --> 00:03:52.827]  They keep on humiliating our people, and that's growing.
[00:03:52.827 --> 00:03:54.368]  People keep on pointing at me.
[00:03:54.368 --> 00:03:58.889]  I voted on you for you to do something.
[00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:02.691]  Voted on you so you make decisions.
[00:04:02.691 --> 00:04:05.272]  And it's true.
[00:04:05.272 --> 00:04:08.353]  I couldn't care less with the re-election.
[00:04:08.353 --> 00:04:11.834]  And we have to think about that, all of us.
[00:04:11.834 --> 00:04:14.655]  What these sons of bitches want is our freedom.
[00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.263]  Look, look how easy it is to impose a dictatorship in Brazil.
[00:04:20.263 --> 00:04:22.005]  How easy it is.
[00:04:22.005 --> 00:04:24.068]  Well, here's the good news.
[00:04:24.068 --> 00:04:32.659]  We have judges in Illinois moving to override the unconstitutional continued lockdown order of the bureaucrats.
[00:04:33.683 --> 00:04:45.972]  We have Trump coming out on Friday and saying that he is saying the states are open and that religious services are essential or he will override the governors and that is a federal issue because it is the First Amendment.
[00:04:45.972 --> 00:04:47.473]  That's how the First Amendment begins.
[00:04:47.473 --> 00:04:56.940]  For those that don't know, Congress will make no law respecting an established religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or the press or the right of the people.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.381]  Memorial Day is here.
[00:05:00.381 --> 00:05:02.561]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year.
[00:05:02.561 --> 00:05:07.343]  And we were already running a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.
[00:05:07.343 --> 00:05:15.946]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale, and then five items that weren't on sale that we got back in stock, they're also massively discounted as well.
[00:05:16.286 --> 00:05:17.867]  For the Memorial Day Special.
[00:05:17.867 --> 00:05:18.808]  So here it is.

[00:05:26.014 --> 00:05:26.975]  It is 50% off.
[00:05:26.975 --> 00:05:30.278]  Bio Dru Selenium, 60% off.
[00:05:30.278 --> 00:05:33.661]  Chill Force, it's incredible, 60% off.

[00:05:45.874 --> 00:05:47.516]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[00:05:47.516 --> 00:05:54.365]  We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supporting you and your family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[00:05:54.365 --> 00:05:55.887]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[00:05:55.887 --> 00:05:56.788]  We are all in this together.
[00:06:08.573 --> 00:06:16.338]  We must declare war on the giant, organized, global government fraud that is COVID-19.
[00:06:16.338 --> 00:06:21.982]  We must tell every person we walk past in the street, or at church, or at work.
[00:06:21.982 --> 00:06:27.305]  Everywhere we go, from the grocery store, to the five and dime, to the gas station.
[00:06:27.305 --> 00:06:31.268]  We have to declare COVID-19 is a hoax.
[00:06:31.268 --> 00:06:33.849]  COVID-19 is medical tyranny.
[00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:37.512]  COVID-19 is permanent medical martial law.
[00:06:39.282 --> 00:06:40.763]  160 days out from the election.
[00:06:40.763 --> 00:06:42.845]  The final countdown.
[00:06:42.845 --> 00:06:44.746]  Tuesday, May 26, 2020.
[00:06:44.746 --> 00:06:47.588]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:47.588 --> 00:06:50.330]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.651]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us.
[00:06:51.651 --> 00:06:52.892]  Max Keiser, your calls.
[00:06:54.005 --> 00:06:56.547]  Then there's The War Room, 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:06:56.547 --> 00:07:00.431]  with the great Owen Schroyer, of course, right before this transmission every day.
[00:07:00.431 --> 00:07:01.952]  David Knight and The David Knight Show.
[00:07:01.952 --> 00:07:04.495]  You want real research, a lot of great documentation.
[00:07:04.495 --> 00:07:06.236]  David does a fabulous job.
[00:07:06.236 --> 00:07:07.718]  That is 8 a.m.
[00:07:07.718 --> 00:07:08.438]  to 11 a.m.
[00:07:08.438 --> 00:07:09.099]  Central.
[00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:11.822]  Okay.
[00:07:11.822 --> 00:07:19.649]  I know all of you know this, but we have over 200 radio affiliates, and we have a lot of TV affiliates, and there are new people tuning in every day.
[00:07:22.609 --> 00:07:29.511]  And they hear us talk about things and they wonder, because they've heard the media say I'm a liar, is that really true?
[00:07:29.511 --> 00:07:47.876]  You know, when I get up here and I say the original models from February, financed in England and in the United States by Bill and Melinda Gates, the usual suspects, said that there'd be 2.2 million dead by now in the United States and 500 plus thousand dead by now in the United Kingdom.
[00:07:47.876 --> 00:07:49.757]  Of course, it's not anywhere near that.
[00:07:53.322 --> 00:08:17.892]  And you can pull up those numbers for yourself, but let me just get an overhead shot here, so I can give people the actual articles and the place to get it for themselves, because we're going to go over these numbers, because it's important to understand that the general public knows they're being lied to, but they don't know how severely, and so you have to show them the facts.
[00:08:18.797 --> 00:08:31.402]  And that's why we're creating a special section on InfoWars that has short little two-minute videos that will be done in about a week, and then just links to articles and links to graphs showing the bibliography to people so you can send it out to everyone you know.
[00:08:31.402 --> 00:08:36.043]  We're going to create a site that isn't banned yet.
[00:08:36.043 --> 00:08:39.945]  Of course, InfoWars is banned from being shared on many platforms, but you can still word-of-mouth share it.
[00:08:41.237 --> 00:08:43.039]  But this is the fight.
[00:08:43.039 --> 00:08:50.746]  Exposing this hoax, exposing this fraud, and exposing specifically how the fraud works is key.
[00:08:50.746 --> 00:08:57.333]  Just like folks exposed that man-made global warming didn't exist, it was a giant global government carbon tax takeover.
[00:08:57.333 --> 00:09:00.356]  It took decades to defeat it.
[00:09:00.356 --> 00:09:03.619]  They spent hundreds of billions of dollars to push it, but it's dead on arrival.
[00:09:04.807 --> 00:09:20.611]  Well, this whole lockdown global government surveillance system was already being beta-tested by the Rockefellers, the Chi-Coms, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on record, with Lockstep and Event 201 and the rest of them, and Bill Gates admits that.
[00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:24.551]  He calls this a drill on national TV now.
[00:09:24.551 --> 00:09:25.812]  He says, oh, this is the test.
[00:09:25.812 --> 00:09:27.152]  You know, this isn't that bad.
[00:09:27.152 --> 00:09:29.513]  There's something a lot worse coming.
[00:09:29.513 --> 00:09:31.293]  Bio-weapons terrorists are going to release it.
[00:09:33.973 --> 00:09:35.653]  So this is all the marbles.
[00:09:35.653 --> 00:09:36.874]  It's the medical tyranny.
[00:09:36.874 --> 00:09:38.134]  It's always been that.
[00:09:38.134 --> 00:09:43.176]  The excuse for the surveillance, the excuse for the snitch groups, the excuse for the forced inoculations.
[00:09:43.176 --> 00:09:45.296]  It's the whole enchilada.
[00:09:45.296 --> 00:09:52.578]  And that digital database proving you've been given all your inoculations will be used as the global currency.
[00:09:52.578 --> 00:09:54.439]  And that's all official as well.
[00:09:54.439 --> 00:10:01.821]  And your medical subservience, your medical slavery, submitting your body to the state and these megacorporations and the UN,
[00:10:03.263 --> 00:10:05.184]  Is your religious sacrament.
[00:10:05.184 --> 00:10:08.246]  You don't take the blood of Christ, the body of Christ.
[00:10:08.246 --> 00:10:12.069]  You take the Bill of Melinda Gates seed into your body.
[00:10:12.069 --> 00:10:16.712]  And we've got amazing deep research on that today, we'll be getting into as well.
[00:10:16.712 --> 00:10:19.514]  But let's just look at a smattering of these articles.
[00:10:19.514 --> 00:10:21.295]  Now this is the really big news.
[00:10:21.295 --> 00:10:30.040]  Imperial College scientist who predicted 500,000 dead from coronavirus in UK adjust figure to 20K.
[00:10:33.237 --> 00:10:33.917]  Confusion!
[00:10:33.917 --> 00:10:39.141]  Imperial College scientist, 500,000 coronavirus deaths projection.
[00:10:39.141 --> 00:10:44.044]  White House takes aim after dire report on death toll.
[00:10:44.044 --> 00:10:46.806]  They said it'd be 2.2 million, but it wasn't.
[00:10:46.806 --> 00:10:52.010]  It's 100,000, and that's totally inflated.
[00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:56.053]  Epidemiologist behind highly cyto-coronavirus model drastically downgrades projection.
[00:10:57.452 --> 00:10:59.993]  How one model simulated 2.2 million U.S.
[00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.473]  deaths from COVID-19.
[00:11:01.473 --> 00:11:02.534]  Cato.org.
[00:11:02.534 --> 00:11:05.014]  It's all right there, but let's look at the new stuff today.
[00:11:05.014 --> 00:11:13.617]  Because, you know, they only did it 10 to 1, 15 to 1, 20 to 1 on these models here in the United States and the UK.
[00:11:13.617 --> 00:11:18.679]  In places like Sweden and Germany, they had it 40 to 1, 50 to 1, the death toll.
[00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:20.320]  Same thing in Brazil.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:22.720]  They were saying a million are going to die.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:23.681]  Last time I checked, it's like 30,000.
[00:11:27.031 --> 00:11:32.357]  And again, globally, their standardized healthcare systems and insurance companies are global.
[00:11:32.357 --> 00:11:36.582]  And so, if you say someone died of COVID-19, you get way more money.
[00:11:36.582 --> 00:11:37.944]  That's on record.
[00:11:37.944 --> 00:11:42.149]  In the United States, it's almost $14,000 to say you have a COVID patient, period, in the building.
[00:11:42.149 --> 00:11:45.513]  Just pure cash on you.
[00:11:45.513 --> 00:11:45.854]  Up front.
[00:11:46.803 --> 00:11:54.229]  Then if you stick a tube down their throat and intubate them, that's an extra 39 smackers.
[00:11:54.229 --> 00:11:54.869]  39 grand.
[00:11:54.869 --> 00:11:58.732]  And then it just gravy trains on from there.
[00:11:58.732 --> 00:12:00.274]  Gravy trains.
[00:12:00.274 --> 00:12:02.575]  And here's what's incredible.
[00:12:02.575 --> 00:12:05.017]  They're not even trying to hide any of this now.
[00:12:05.017 --> 00:12:07.739]  But let's get to the new big ones.
[00:12:07.739 --> 00:12:12.763]  You've seen the meme that, oh yeah, a great white shark attacked a lady and they called it COVID-19.
[00:12:14.778 --> 00:12:17.580]  That meme is a joke, but where it comes from isn't.
[00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.023]  This is just in the news today at NationalFile.com.
[00:12:21.023 --> 00:12:23.965]  We're going to post this article on Infowars.com.
[00:12:23.965 --> 00:12:29.049]  Gunshot victims count as coronavirus deaths in Washington State.
[00:12:29.049 --> 00:12:31.631]  This is some real original reporting.
[00:12:31.631 --> 00:12:37.015]  Freedom Foundation reports did a Freedom of Information Act request, and they admitted
[00:12:38.413 --> 00:12:47.438]  Gunshot wounds, car wrecks, suicides, and then they test you with the Bill and Melinda Gates U.N.
[00:12:47.438 --> 00:12:51.441]  testing kit that the FDA shut down for fraud.
[00:12:51.441 --> 00:12:59.266]  And the kit finds almost everyone is positive if you've had the flu or a coronavirus on average the last decade.
[00:12:59.266 --> 00:13:01.727]  So they say get vaccines every decade or so, quote, immunity goes away.
[00:13:01.727 --> 00:13:02.628]  That's pretty accurate.
[00:13:02.628 --> 00:13:07.931]  But if you've had a cold virus or you've had a flu virus, you have the detritus in your body from that fight.
[00:13:08.848 --> 00:13:12.449]  You have the wreckage of it, not the antibodies, just the genetic wreckage.
[00:13:12.449 --> 00:13:19.611]  And so, everyone that's had a cold or the flu in the last 10 years, baby, you got Corona!
[00:13:19.611 --> 00:13:21.011]  And that's only one type of test.
[00:13:21.011 --> 00:13:26.292]  And I told you it was a fraud, and now it's come out that Bill and Melinda Gates are financing the main test, and it's a damn fraud!
[00:13:26.292 --> 00:13:30.393]  Not approved, and a damn fraud!
[00:13:30.393 --> 00:13:33.614]  But that's only one level to the juiciness, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:34.764 --> 00:13:35.705]  Look at this article.
[00:13:35.705 --> 00:13:41.728]  Gunshot victims count as coronavirus deaths in Washington State.
[00:13:41.728 --> 00:13:48.232]  And it goes over the entire thing.
[00:13:48.232 --> 00:13:48.652]  Unbelievable.
[00:13:48.652 --> 00:13:49.112]  Here's another one.
[00:13:49.112 --> 00:13:50.153]  New York Times.
[00:13:50.153 --> 00:13:50.353]  U.S.
[00:13:50.353 --> 00:13:52.874]  deaths near 100,000 since last Friday.
[00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:55.176]  An incalculable loss.
[00:13:55.176 --> 00:13:57.737]  Sixth name on the New York Times list.
[00:13:57.737 --> 00:14:00.058]  Six in of coronavirus victims.
[00:14:00.058 --> 00:14:02.560]  A 27-year-old man who was murdered.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:11.384]  Murdered when you get stabbed, when you get shot, you are a COVID-19 death.
[00:14:11.384 --> 00:14:14.285]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is all happening.
[00:14:14.285 --> 00:14:16.226]  This is how dumb they think you are.
[00:14:16.226 --> 00:14:18.267]  How suggestible.
[00:14:18.267 --> 00:14:26.572]  And that's why 80% in the United States of COVID-19 deaths are over the age
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.361]  Look it up for yourself.
[00:14:29.361 --> 00:14:30.661]  It's the same thing in Europe.
[00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:32.582]  It's the same thing everywhere because it's a fraud.
[00:14:32.582 --> 00:14:54.531]  You die when you've got all these other diseases and kidney failure and liver failure and lung cancer and bone cancer and brain cancer and they come in and stick a test in you that's designed to be a fraud when you croak and they say it's COVID so you can scare the living daylights out of the public and I know all of you know this so I'm gonna say this.
[00:14:54.531 --> 00:14:56.652]  We'll post the clip from this show
[00:14:57.714 --> 00:15:03.780]  Today, we're building a site that shows all the facts, so folks don't have to look it up for themselves, they can just click right there.
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.081]  We're making it easy.
[00:15:05.081 --> 00:15:11.346]  But do you understand, when we come back, what they're going to do, they're going to have another lockdown around the election.
[00:15:11.346 --> 00:15:12.367]  It's never going to end.
[00:15:12.367 --> 00:15:14.589]  It makes the UN the boss.
[00:15:14.589 --> 00:15:16.891]  It's meant to devastate the first world economy.
[00:15:16.891 --> 00:15:20.675]  China is exempting themselves, says they're over it, they're not going to have more lockdowns.
[00:15:20.675 --> 00:15:22.777]  This is a fraudulent takeover.
[00:15:23.936 --> 00:15:26.277]  This is an economic warfare operation.
[00:15:26.277 --> 00:15:33.742]  And the Pentagon has come out and said that this is China's Chernobyl, and that China covered it up to deliberately hurt us.
[00:15:33.742 --> 00:15:34.563]  It's worse than that.
[00:15:34.563 --> 00:15:36.604]  They released the damn thing.
[00:15:36.604 --> 00:15:46.230]  You've got top scientists in Australia, in India, in Germany, in the US, in France, in Canada, all coming out, scan the virus.
[00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:51.353]  They said, this thing is so man-made, it's ridiculous.
[00:15:51.353 --> 00:15:52.794]  People go, well then you can't have it both ways, Alex.
[00:15:54.246 --> 00:15:55.086]  Yes, we can.
[00:15:55.086 --> 00:15:55.787]  It's man-made.
[00:15:55.787 --> 00:15:57.007]  I'll tell you why when we come back.
[00:15:57.007 --> 00:16:03.610]  It took hundreds and hundreds of years of human civilization to build up the world economy to where it is.
[00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:19.097]  Every economist is on record saying that as this economy has been shut down for two months, it is going to be a death sentence to the third world, and a horrible, nightmarish collapse for the first world, and that the general public is going to go into deep, deep debt to the mega banks,
[00:16:19.537 --> 00:16:22.818]  They're not going to have medical ID cards, forced inoculations.
[00:16:22.818 --> 00:16:25.959]  We are now in a giant dystopia.
[00:16:25.959 --> 00:16:45.263]  But a lot of people are waking up, and there is a major backlash taking place against this tyranny, and we must all rediscover our Bill of Rights, rediscover our Constitution and our backbone, and start saying no to people who take this moral high ground and say, shut your business down, shut your life down, it'll save lives.
[00:16:45.643 --> 00:16:46.183]  No.
[00:16:46.183 --> 00:16:50.244]  It's caused millions to already starve to death, tens of millions more.
[00:16:50.244 --> 00:16:55.106]  So the cowards who went along with this with your virtue signaling, you have destroyed your lives and our lives.
[00:16:55.106 --> 00:16:57.066]  Congratulations.
[00:16:57.066 --> 00:17:04.068]  Feudalism in the ancient world, from Asia to Europe, from Africa to Latin America, was the most common form of government.
[00:17:04.068 --> 00:17:12.611]  You had a ruling class, the nobility, with a king and queen sitting on top of it, and the rest of the public were kept at a subsistence, starving level.
[00:17:13.371 --> 00:17:15.013]  For control.
[00:17:15.013 --> 00:17:26.544]  In fact, in most cultures they called the peasants the little people because they were usually a foot or more shorter than the lords and ladies because they kept them, again, at a starving level.
[00:17:26.544 --> 00:17:30.949]  They were so busy trying to survive, they would never try to challenge the entrenched elite.
[00:17:31.289 --> 00:17:48.536]  Well, now all the big Google owners and the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, the Jeff Bezoses of the world, they're sitting back on their giant estates with their jet helicopters and private jets, living the life, laughing at you, shut down, going bankrupt in the third world, starving to death.
[00:17:48.536 --> 00:17:54.318]  Their religion is power and control, and they are pressing that advantage against us.
[00:17:54.318 --> 00:17:55.959]  We must break free from these monsters.
[00:18:00.382 --> 00:18:11.291]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:11.291 --> 00:18:20.740]  This is the end, beautiful friend.
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:27.005]  This is the end, my only friend, the end.
[00:18:39.363 --> 00:18:42.085]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[00:18:42.085 --> 00:18:44.226]  I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:18:44.226 --> 00:18:49.410]  Okay, so I'm just going to restate this because this is the entire shooting match.
[00:18:49.410 --> 00:18:54.573]  It's the entire spectrum of what we're dealing with as a society and as a culture.
[00:18:56.838 --> 00:19:07.392]  Every facet of the COVID-19 rollout was scripted and battle-planned and prepared by the most powerful globalist foundations and corporations on earth, publicly.
[00:19:07.392 --> 00:19:12.559]  Every facet of it has been a giant, premeditated, complete and total lie.
[00:19:19.551 --> 00:19:23.914]  And the agenda of where it's taking us is a true dystopia.
[00:19:23.914 --> 00:19:35.462]  You already noticed that just 73 days into the forced police state lockdown, in some areas of Europe, they're into month number four and a half.
[00:19:36.701 --> 00:19:41.425]  You notice it just gets worse and worse and worse and worse.
[00:19:41.425 --> 00:20:03.143]  And the more we submit, the more they squeeze to see what they can get out of you because they're trying to erase thousands of years of progress of humans standing up and demanding liberty and paying for it in blood and in treasure and in time and in everything else.
[00:20:03.143 --> 00:20:03.603]  So that's
[00:20:04.858 --> 00:20:18.010]  What we face as a culture and as a society and as a planet.
[00:20:18.010 --> 00:20:26.958]  And we could sit here and let these criminal liars get away with what they're doing, or we can stand up to them.
[00:20:26.958 --> 00:20:30.562]  Every grocery store I go in, every
[00:20:35.461 --> 00:20:40.426]  Gas station I go into, every restaurant I go into now that they're reopened partially.
[00:20:40.426 --> 00:20:42.788]  When the waitress walks up I say, you can take that mask off.
[00:20:42.788 --> 00:20:45.971]  Well, we were ordered to and I said, but you know they're counting every death.
[00:20:45.971 --> 00:20:50.175]  Car wrecks, gunshot wounds, people that had cancer as COVID-19.
[00:20:50.175 --> 00:20:51.877]  They're like, yeah, I heard that.
[00:20:51.877 --> 00:20:53.699]  And most people are actually somewhat informed.
[00:21:00.273 --> 00:21:03.016]  And most people I talk to actually already know all this.
[00:21:03.016 --> 00:21:06.539]  And then I say to them, I say, then you need to tell other people.
[00:21:06.539 --> 00:21:10.923]  You need to let them know it's a fraud.
[00:21:10.923 --> 00:21:13.666]  This female waitress was sitting there yesterday and she said, you're right.
[00:21:13.666 --> 00:21:15.027]  I need to.
[00:21:15.027 --> 00:21:19.612]  And her and the manager and the other person took their mask off and said, this is all just a giant hoax.
[00:21:24.192 --> 00:21:29.773]  And then I sat there and exchanged phone numbers with her and said, I'm going to send you articles and documentation.
[00:21:29.773 --> 00:21:30.193]  And I did.
[00:21:30.193 --> 00:21:36.615]  And I wasn't hitting on her, even though she was attractive.
[00:21:36.615 --> 00:21:38.435]  That's what it's going to take to beat these people.
[00:21:38.435 --> 00:21:40.735]  It's just simple selling the truth.
[00:21:40.735 --> 00:21:43.316]  Selling the truth.
[00:21:43.316 --> 00:21:47.937]  Look, I've been doing this full time for like two months.
[00:21:47.937 --> 00:21:52.378]  Since the mass went on in Texas and all the hysteria and all the garbage.
[00:21:53.704 --> 00:22:02.211]  I have been talking to hike and bike trail, somebody goes like this and gets back from me, I start talking to them very nicely but laying out the facts.
[00:22:02.211 --> 00:22:07.475]  And you'll find that most people were just going along with it because they think it's peer pressure and what they're supposed to do.
[00:22:07.475 --> 00:22:19.305]  Others think they're heroes because they're buying into it and what they're buying into is the total destruction of civilization and society.
[00:22:19.305 --> 00:22:20.086]  The takedown
[00:22:21.488 --> 00:22:29.291]  Of the free market capitalist civilization, because the globalists have decided they want to, not just a post-human world, a post-industrial world.
[00:22:29.291 --> 00:22:31.652]  And so this is economic warfare.
[00:22:31.652 --> 00:22:35.974]  And they script it like, oh, you're heroes, you know, not opening your company.
[00:22:35.974 --> 00:22:38.295]  Oh, you're heroes getting that welfare check.
[00:22:38.295 --> 00:22:40.116]  Oh, you're heroes wearing that mask.
[00:22:40.116 --> 00:22:41.036]  Oh, you're such heroes.
[00:22:41.036 --> 00:22:44.518]  And really, you're buying into a giant premeditated fraud.
[00:22:45.831 --> 00:22:55.742]  People say to me, Alex, wait a minute, you first said with experts back in late January that COVID-19 was a man-made bioweapon out of the Wuhan bioweapon lab.
[00:22:55.742 --> 00:22:58.445]  Well, it's so deadly, it's a bioweapon.
[00:22:58.445 --> 00:23:01.228]  No, no, no, it's a psychological weapon.
[00:23:01.228 --> 00:23:06.674]  But you need to have, again, a cold virus that's man-made so you can finally own it.
[00:23:07.722 --> 00:23:25.713]  And finally have an artificial mutation whose baby mutations you've already tested in labs, in tissue cultures, so that it stays around a long time and so you can own it and make money off of it and have tests that find it in everyone.
[00:23:25.713 --> 00:23:28.054]  So it has incredible gain of function.
[00:23:28.054 --> 00:23:34.318]  Two different main varieties as you know, hundreds of sub-varieties of each, but one is very easy to catch.
[00:23:35.612 --> 00:23:38.533]  But isn't very harmful.
[00:23:38.533 --> 00:23:42.854]  One, it does have a high kill rate for a respiratory cold.
[00:23:42.854 --> 00:23:45.655]  It's nasty, but a lot of nasty stuff.
[00:23:45.655 --> 00:23:46.355]  And it's hard to get.
[00:23:46.355 --> 00:23:48.696]  They engineered all that.
[00:23:48.696 --> 00:23:51.136]  And it's come out how they engineered it.
[00:23:51.136 --> 00:23:57.458]  And they had documentaries in 2015 in Wuhan bragging for Italian TV how they were testing weaponized chimeras
[00:23:58.624 --> 00:24:02.646]  of the coronavirus family on humans.
[00:24:02.646 --> 00:24:04.267]  So we knew they were lying about it.
[00:24:04.267 --> 00:24:05.528]  We knew the NIH funded it.
[00:24:05.528 --> 00:24:06.789]  We knew Obama did it.
[00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:07.769]  We knew it was man-made.
[00:24:07.769 --> 00:24:11.972]  There was a major controversy five years ago.
[00:24:11.972 --> 00:24:21.618]  And so, yes, ladies and gentlemen, we have to expose these monsters because the very people that engineered it all are the ones now posing
[00:24:22.714 --> 00:24:28.436]  As our saviors and we have to understand we are under the gun by predators.
[00:24:28.436 --> 00:24:31.917]  These really are evil people and I know I don't want to admit it.
[00:24:31.917 --> 00:24:33.358]  You don't want to admit it.
[00:24:33.358 --> 00:24:33.958]  My gosh.
[00:24:33.958 --> 00:24:39.160]  I've been really upset more than I ever been knowing all this to actually see the trap shut.
[00:24:41.007 --> 00:24:43.589]  It's like you're telling your kid, hey watch out, that's a bear trap over there.
[00:24:43.589 --> 00:24:44.130]  They don't listen.
[00:24:44.130 --> 00:24:46.832]  Step it and it clangs on their leg and almost chops it off.
[00:24:46.832 --> 00:24:48.233]  You're trying to get the bear trap off.
[00:24:48.233 --> 00:24:52.137]  Do you feel good that you were right and your six-year-old walked over and stepped in the bear trap?
[00:24:52.137 --> 00:24:58.402]  No, you're not happy that the damn thing shut on our collective leg.
[00:24:58.402 --> 00:24:59.143]  But it did.
[00:24:59.143 --> 00:25:05.769]  Now we got the bear trap on our leg and CNN's telling you it's mama giving you a kiss on the cheek and it ain't.
[00:25:07.338 --> 00:25:11.243]  And so people better get pissed, and we better get this damn thing off our leg.
[00:25:11.243 --> 00:25:15.108]  And let me tell you, it's gonna hurt.
[00:25:15.108 --> 00:25:17.531]  But you know what the bear trap's for, right?
[00:25:17.531 --> 00:25:18.693]  It's to hold you down.
[00:25:21.650 --> 00:25:27.116]  So that when they come to kill the bear, you can't get away.
[00:25:27.116 --> 00:25:29.418]  You're being put on lockdown.
[00:25:29.418 --> 00:25:31.240]  You're being put on house arrest.
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.622]  I'm being put on lockdown.
[00:25:32.622 --> 00:25:34.224]  You're being held hostage.
[00:25:34.224 --> 00:25:35.905]  You're getting bitch slapped.
[00:25:35.905 --> 00:25:38.729]  You're getting taught who your daddy is.
[00:25:40.305 --> 00:25:44.389]  You're getting taught that all the tracking stuff they already had in place is something you've got to accept.
[00:25:44.389 --> 00:25:48.352]  And you're getting told that all these unemployed people are going to be new snitches.
[00:25:48.352 --> 00:25:54.177]  Oh, in this new international program that the UN runs with the health services.
[00:25:54.177 --> 00:25:56.999]  Becoming the global government.
[00:25:56.999 --> 00:26:02.324]  If Hitler came in lab coats, we'd have laid down to him and said, yes sir, Heil Hitler.
[00:26:02.324 --> 00:26:04.566]  If he wore a pink uniform, we would have bowed to him.
[00:26:04.566 --> 00:26:05.247]  But he didn't.
[00:26:05.247 --> 00:26:06.668]  He came with tanks and airplanes.
[00:26:07.935 --> 00:26:10.082]  And so we said, oh, you're gonna kick our ass?
[00:26:10.082 --> 00:26:11.828]  We'll kick your ass!
[00:26:11.828 --> 00:26:13.032]  Because it was out in the open.
[00:26:14.599 --> 00:26:22.203]  But if he'd have been a convicted pedophile and said, I just want to love your children and groom them, and the school said so, you'd sit right on Hitler's lap.
[00:26:22.203 --> 00:26:22.843]  Wouldn't you?
[00:26:22.843 --> 00:26:24.784]  Because we've all been tested and prepared.
[00:26:24.784 --> 00:26:32.127]  And when they said, look, they'll even let convicted pedophiles have their way with their children on TV and literally hump kids on TV, they said, then launch the attack.
[00:26:32.127 --> 00:26:34.008]  These people will put up anything.
[00:26:34.008 --> 00:26:35.929]  And they're going to take everything you've got.
[00:26:35.929 --> 00:26:37.630]  Submission to this is death.
[00:26:39.423 --> 00:26:40.324]  It's humiliation.
[00:26:40.324 --> 00:26:40.904]  It's slavery.
[00:26:40.904 --> 00:26:42.966]  It's everything under the sun.

[00:26:46.248 --> 00:26:48.129]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:26:48.129 --> 00:26:50.171]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:26:50.171 --> 00:26:51.332]  You are the Paul Reveres.
[00:26:51.332 --> 00:26:53.673]  However you're listening, tell folks to tune in now.
[00:26:53.673 --> 00:26:55.815]  Now you are the resistance.
[00:26:55.815 --> 00:26:58.317]  The lockdown is permanent dictatorship.
[00:26:58.937 --> 00:27:13.689]  The lockdown is designed to have the public accept their basic rights being suspended and a global medical tyranny led by the WHO and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in full control.
[00:27:13.689 --> 00:27:15.791]  Many will submit through fear.
[00:27:15.791 --> 00:27:17.493]  Others will be bought off.
[00:27:17.493 --> 00:27:22.957]  But in the end, the globalists admit they're building a post-human world.
[00:27:22.957 --> 00:27:26.200]  And now that we're inside the cage, it's going to move very, very
[00:27:29.508 --> 00:27:43.055]  Submission to this is a form of living death and committing the next generation and our own generation to a living hell that cannot be imagined until you're actually experiencing this.
[00:27:43.055 --> 00:27:47.757]  This is your dignity, your soul, your future being poured inside out.
[00:27:47.757 --> 00:27:48.097]  This is
[00:27:55.362 --> 00:27:59.845]  We are 170 days out from the 2020 election.
[00:27:59.845 --> 00:28:04.409]  It is a referendum of national sovereignty against globalism.
[00:28:04.409 --> 00:28:14.136]  And Obama, Hillary, and the deep state have been caught attempting to overthrow President Trump's election, and they've been caught in two separate coup attempts against the president.
[00:28:14.136 --> 00:28:21.001]  Now, they've been pushing COVID-19 to shut down the economy and create a depression, while China's already been open for business for more than a month.
[00:28:21.741 --> 00:28:33.829]  This is an ongoing globalist attempt to punish the American people, wreck our economy, and hope that we won't recognize that it is they, the New World Order, that have orchestrated this and not President Trump.
[00:28:33.829 --> 00:28:35.550]  They know their crimes are coming out.
[00:28:35.550 --> 00:28:37.492]  They know the chickens are coming home to roost.
[00:28:38.032 --> 00:28:46.579]  So now they're panicking and trying to steal the 2020 election with mail-in ballots based on keeping the public safe from COVID-19.
[00:28:46.579 --> 00:28:53.104]  The entire COVID-19 system is a giant hoax and must be exposed if America has any hope.
[00:28:53.104 --> 00:28:56.687]  So get out there and expose this fraud.
[00:28:56.687 --> 00:29:02.192]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[00:29:02.192 --> 00:29:02.392]  We won't
[00:29:05.154 --> 00:29:05.835]  We're good to go.
[00:29:30.311 --> 00:29:38.778]  And Coke U10 can do for you no matter how old you are, no matter what color you are, no matter where you live in the world, it works the same on everybody.
[00:29:38.778 --> 00:29:41.360]  It's known to be able to regrow nerves.
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:44.703]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer.
[00:29:44.703 --> 00:29:49.326]  Doesn't make them grow, makes them shrink slower, which is basically the same thing.
[00:29:49.326 --> 00:29:54.210]  DNA Force Plus is 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:58.695 --> 00:30:01.377]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:30:33.496 --> 00:30:37.959]  Well, if you want to be free, you should run away from submission.
[00:30:37.959 --> 00:30:44.523]  You should fight back in any way you can because submission to the whole COVID-19 Bill of Malindicates, U.N.
[00:30:44.523 --> 00:30:49.226]  rollout is the end of human freedom as we know it.
[00:30:49.226 --> 00:30:52.808]  All right.
[00:30:52.808 --> 00:30:54.890]  Let me do this.
[00:30:54.890 --> 00:31:00.053]  Let me show you the face of true fascism and true authoritarianism.
[00:31:00.053 --> 00:31:02.615]  This is footage from this weekend out of Staten Island, New York.
[00:31:04.241 --> 00:31:09.723]  Where a woman is not wearing her burka mask of submission.
[00:31:09.723 --> 00:31:15.725]  And so a mob of men and women begin screaming and cussing at her and run her out of the store.
[00:31:15.725 --> 00:31:21.066]  Leftist on Twitter celebrated it and said she deserved to be beaten in the head because she is a criminal.
[00:31:21.066 --> 00:31:22.507]  She's a potential carrier.
[00:31:22.507 --> 00:31:23.407]  She's a murderer.
[00:31:23.407 --> 00:31:25.668]  You know, we're all suspects now.
[00:31:25.668 --> 00:31:30.069]  We're all guilty until vaccinated however many times Bill Gates wants.
[00:31:31.203 --> 00:31:34.704]  We're all guilty until sterilized, not innocent until proven guilty.
[00:31:34.704 --> 00:31:37.305]  Guilty until vaccinated, until dead.
[00:31:37.305 --> 00:31:38.446]  Here's that video.
[00:32:02.478 --> 00:32:12.086]  And so you got full-grown men thugging out, strutting around, yelling at a woman.
[00:32:12.086 --> 00:32:24.838]  And again, that's New York run by criminals so hardcore that they have more deaths than any other large group of states combined because it's all fraud.
[00:32:24.838 --> 00:32:25.519]  But it gets worse.
[00:32:27.739 --> 00:32:29.360]  We're going to play this footage here in a moment.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:29.901]  Update.
[00:32:29.901 --> 00:32:40.350]  Black man caught on video beating elderly nursing home patient was arrested after hero Tom Fenton from Judicial Watch alerts authorities.
[00:32:40.350 --> 00:32:46.495]  It has to be a national watchdog that even cares to go find out and do something.
[00:32:46.495 --> 00:32:49.758]  And it turns out that individual that was there beating up the old people.
[00:32:49.758 --> 00:32:51.219]  We're going to play it with audio here in a moment.
[00:32:53.735 --> 00:32:58.136]  He was put there because he tested positive for COVID-19.
[00:32:58.136 --> 00:33:11.220]  He was asymptomatic, got tested, and sent as a cash cow welfare bonanza, reportedly by his family, and didn't even work in the facility.
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:14.441]  Now think about that.
[00:33:14.441 --> 00:33:18.342]  You have COVID-19, and so you send people, young people,
[00:33:19.534 --> 00:33:22.156]  Into a nursing home to then infect them.
[00:33:22.156 --> 00:33:23.937]  And this is another Democrat plan.
[00:33:23.937 --> 00:33:30.142]  Because if you've got almost dead people, and you give them pneumonia, you can up that number.
[00:33:30.142 --> 00:33:32.804]  And then they get to intubate everybody.
[00:33:32.804 --> 00:33:45.534]  And so that's why in New York, in Michigan, in California, in Oregon, in Washington State, in Minnesota, all the Democrat rat nests, New Jersey,
[00:33:46.837 --> 00:33:56.125]  They're on record shipping young people into nursing homes and saying nursing homes are where COVID patients go.
[00:33:56.125 --> 00:33:58.547]  Meanwhile, the hospitals are empty!
[00:33:58.547 --> 00:34:02.331]  And the heroes at the nursing homes!
[00:34:02.331 --> 00:34:04.172]  One of the most abusive industries on record.
[00:34:04.172 --> 00:34:04.993]  Some are good, some are bad.
[00:34:04.993 --> 00:34:08.336]  I know folks that have worked at nursing homes, physical therapists that are wonderful angels.
[00:34:08.336 --> 00:34:10.638]  There are plenty of evil people in there, as everybody knows.
[00:34:10.638 --> 00:34:11.719]  You get very callous in there.
[00:34:13.052 --> 00:34:19.694]  And so, oh, if the whole nursing home gets COVID-19, that's 13,000 smackers per person.
[00:34:19.694 --> 00:34:21.634]  And then, whoo!
[00:34:21.634 --> 00:34:23.495]  Lordy, lordy, lordy!
[00:34:23.495 --> 00:34:30.736]  When a bunch of the Alzheimer's patients that are 90 years old on average, when they get that COVID, they said, the UN set the standards.
[00:34:30.736 --> 00:34:32.777]  Snake a tube down their throat, intubate them.
[00:34:32.777 --> 00:34:34.237]  39,000 sweetsies.
[00:34:39.653 --> 00:34:43.834]  But you got to put the poison in.
[00:34:43.834 --> 00:35:02.058]  So, it's hard to get people already nursing home sick, so you find people in the community that have it, you get them tested, and then you ship that weapon like the British troops give the Native Americans smallpox blankets that had smallpox on it, you just give it to them.
[00:35:02.058 --> 00:35:04.459]  And then you get all that cash!
[00:35:05.499 --> 00:35:09.242]  And it doesn't matter if it's Europe, it doesn't matter if it's the United States, it doesn't matter if it's Australia.
[00:35:09.242 --> 00:35:22.052]  The UN set the scam, the big insurance actuaries, and they paid it all out and they're running that like a football play right up the middle on us.
[00:35:22.052 --> 00:35:29.117]  And now... They're within striking distance of a major touchdown.
[00:35:30.762 --> 00:35:44.730]  Because everybody wants to be genteel and it's a form of elegance and a form of manliness and a form of heroicness to wear the mask and stand back and get all scared and talk about how we lived through it, we survived it.
[00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:56.917]  And meanwhile, a giant criminal conspiracy, actuary, prepared, battle-planned, scripted, blueprinted, war-gamed, was set up at the UN years ago
[00:35:59.366 --> 00:36:10.755]  Wargamed again last October and November with Bill and Melinda Gates captaining it, generaling it, field marshalling it, and then they launched the whole giant sickening enchilada.
[00:36:10.755 --> 00:36:17.861]  And even USA Today did a fact check a month ago and said, it's actually true.
[00:36:17.861 --> 00:36:23.165]  They get $13,000 and $39,000 and then a bunch of other money for the COVID patients.
[00:36:23.165 --> 00:36:26.108]  In fact, can we put that USA Today back on screen for the viewers?
[00:36:26.108 --> 00:36:28.950]  Just take them to the bottom where it says claim is true.
[00:36:33.049 --> 00:36:34.150]  Just go to the bottom.
[00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.530]  That's right.
[00:36:34.530 --> 00:36:36.371]  A little bit quicker.
[00:36:36.371 --> 00:36:39.312]  We'll just mosey on down to that little juicy down there for ya.
[00:36:39.312 --> 00:36:41.113]  No matter.
[00:36:41.113 --> 00:36:42.273]  It's down at the bottom.
[00:36:42.273 --> 00:36:43.674]  Alrighty then.
[00:36:43.674 --> 00:36:45.015]  As a Shventura would say.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.542]  Their ruling is true!
[00:36:49.542 --> 00:36:52.864]  They're even rubbing it in, see?
[00:36:52.864 --> 00:36:56.526]  Rubbing it into your faces, enjoying themselves.
[00:36:56.526 --> 00:36:59.328]  Oh, it's so much fun to scam everyone.
[00:36:59.328 --> 00:37:15.778]  Then say that people like me, that say vitamin D3 and zinc and vitamin C are essential, and that if you don't have those, the virus can get in and replicate, and that's why people starving to death all the time die of the common cold, and that's all scientific, historic, absolute fact!
[00:37:18.001 --> 00:37:22.986]  And they're calling for my arrest all over the news, and everybody else's arrest, and they're SWAT teaming with guys with MP5s.
[00:37:22.986 --> 00:37:23.426]  Get in!
[00:37:23.426 --> 00:37:23.766]  Get in!
[00:37:23.766 --> 00:37:28.531]  It's like doctor's facilities where they're giving people vitamin C. You piece of filth.
[00:37:28.531 --> 00:37:29.952]  Vitamin C crappy American.
[00:37:29.952 --> 00:37:31.214]  Get on you.
[00:37:31.214 --> 00:37:37.299]  They're like, how dare the president tell people hydroxychloroquine and zinc and Z-Pak.
[00:37:37.299 --> 00:37:39.081]  It's doctors all over the world.
[00:37:39.081 --> 00:37:41.003]  100% success rate.
[00:37:41.003 --> 00:37:41.764]  On record.
[00:37:41.764 --> 00:37:42.104]  Shut up!
[00:37:42.344 --> 00:37:43.024]  Shut up Trump!
[00:37:43.024 --> 00:37:43.484]  Shut up!

[00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.349]  Shut up!
[00:38:06.349 --> 00:38:07.509]  Shut up!
[00:38:07.509 --> 00:38:07.789]  Shut up!
[00:38:07.789 --> 00:38:08.009]  Shut up!
[00:38:08.009 --> 00:38:08.169]  Shut up!
[00:38:08.169 --> 00:38:08.409]  Shut up!
[00:38:08.409 --> 00:38:10.470]  Shut up!
[00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.970]  Shut up!
[00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:11.150]  Shut up!
[00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.250]  Shut
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.382]  We're going to count them all as COVID-19, baby.
[00:38:17.382 --> 00:38:19.884]  Look at these articles.
[00:38:19.884 --> 00:38:25.429]  Gunshot victims counted as coronavirus deaths in Washington State.
[00:38:25.429 --> 00:38:30.993]  Sixth name on New York Times list of coronavirus victims is 27-year-old man who was murdered.
[00:38:30.993 --> 00:38:34.856]  Then you go deeper and the whole list is just full of people.
[00:38:34.856 --> 00:38:40.661]  I mean, they'll put you on the list if you died in a car wreck.
[00:38:41.877 --> 00:38:42.739]  Or a gunshot wound.
[00:38:42.739 --> 00:38:43.661]  And here's another one.
[00:38:43.661 --> 00:38:46.166]  Gunshot victims count as coronavirus death in Washington State.
[00:38:46.166 --> 00:38:47.930]  This is just today's news.
[00:38:47.930 --> 00:38:49.173]  Imperial College said 500,000 died.
[00:38:49.173 --> 00:38:49.654]  Nothing even near it.
[00:38:54.551 --> 00:38:56.272]  They said two plus million in the U.S.
[00:38:56.272 --> 00:38:57.073]  Nothing even near it.
[00:38:57.073 --> 00:38:58.874]  And all of that is salted.
[00:38:58.874 --> 00:39:00.656]  All of that is filled with crap.
[00:39:00.656 --> 00:39:01.837]  All of that is lies.
[00:39:01.837 --> 00:39:07.561]  And the very criminals that run the Wuhan lab and Obama and Fauci, it's their next coup.
[00:39:07.561 --> 00:39:09.283]  Russiagate didn't work.
[00:39:09.283 --> 00:39:10.424]  Ukrainegate didn't work.
[00:39:10.424 --> 00:39:12.085]  Race war didn't work.
[00:39:12.085 --> 00:39:14.627]  Crash the economy, though, they think it worked.
[00:39:14.627 --> 00:39:16.309]  And that's what they're betting on.
[00:39:16.309 --> 00:39:18.791]  And Bernie Sanders and Biden are all saying it's Trump's fault.
[00:39:19.511 --> 00:39:21.932]  When they're the ones that ran the whole damn show.
[00:39:21.932 --> 00:39:22.373]  And you know what?
[00:39:22.373 --> 00:39:25.154]  If we're stupid enough to go along with this and not spread the word, then we deserve it.
[00:39:25.154 --> 00:39:26.234]  Here's the bad news.
[00:39:26.234 --> 00:39:27.455]  We come back.
[00:39:27.455 --> 00:39:28.616]  Here's some good news.
[00:39:28.616 --> 00:39:29.196]  People are waking up.
[00:39:29.196 --> 00:39:33.478]  The bad news is... The bad news is... The A.I.
[00:39:33.478 --> 00:39:35.279]  is now in place.
[00:39:35.279 --> 00:39:37.340]  And I've got the reports flooding in, all confirmed.
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:38.801]  In fact, I got another one just a minute ago.
[00:39:38.801 --> 00:39:40.542]  An all-known national talk show host sent me.
[00:39:42.754 --> 00:39:44.375]  That, I need to remind the crew to get pulled up.
[00:39:44.375 --> 00:39:46.357]  This is unbelievable when we come back.
[00:39:46.357 --> 00:39:48.479]  The bad news, because that means we can beat them though.
[00:39:48.479 --> 00:39:50.200]  We got to admit to the bad.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:51.381]  To know how to whoop its ass.
[00:39:51.381 --> 00:39:55.264]  We'll be right back.
[00:39:55.264 --> 00:40:04.311]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chi-coms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[00:40:04.311 --> 00:40:08.295]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world.
[00:40:08.953 --> 00:40:15.500]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going to be.
[00:40:15.500 --> 00:40:21.467]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy.
[00:40:21.467 --> 00:40:29.916]  That's why we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[00:40:30.777 --> 00:40:32.638]  They've admitted all of this.
[00:40:32.638 --> 00:40:40.284]  So remember, how does InfoWars continue years and decades, in many cases, to be able to predict things before they happen?
[00:40:40.284 --> 00:40:44.467]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan.
[00:40:44.467 --> 00:40:45.668]  And yes, it's dystopic.
[00:40:45.668 --> 00:40:46.949]  And yes, it's scary.
[00:40:46.949 --> 00:40:51.172]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[00:40:51.172 --> 00:40:54.154]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[00:40:54.694 --> 00:40:56.034]  Now it's official.
[00:40:56.034 --> 00:41:17.221]  The United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency will last five years and the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of 10 people that you visit and if you go outside that list of 10 you'll be permanently detained.
[00:41:18.061 --> 00:41:29.669]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the New World Order, where they let the criminals out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner.
[00:41:29.669 --> 00:41:34.273]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian, anti-human group.
[00:41:34.833 --> 00:41:42.337]  They have to put this electronic straitjacket on us before they carry out their endgame, which is global depopulation.
[00:41:42.337 --> 00:41:45.879]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[00:41:45.879 --> 00:41:53.183]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts, and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy.
[00:41:53.183 --> 00:41:54.124]  Wake up or die.
[00:41:56.536 --> 00:42:06.465]  What InfoWars has been able to do, thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth, has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[00:42:06.465 --> 00:42:10.329]  This is the battle for the future of humanity.
[00:42:10.329 --> 00:42:16.935]  And now, open world government is being established with an endgame to depopulate the planet.
[00:42:17.635 --> 00:42:23.038]  Now, the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized.
[00:42:23.038 --> 00:42:25.639]  You must decide which side you're on.
[00:42:25.639 --> 00:42:34.584]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm Syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery, destruction, and finally, death.
[00:42:34.584 --> 00:42:39.127]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[00:42:39.127 --> 00:42:40.688]  The delusions must end now.
[00:42:41.668 --> 00:42:47.070]  InfoWars was correct about it all, and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[00:42:47.070 --> 00:42:50.972]  Most people that are aware of the New World Order decide to join it out of fear.
[00:42:50.972 --> 00:42:52.313]  They are truly fools.
[00:42:52.313 --> 00:42:54.714]  We must fight this, or lose our souls.
[00:42:57.756 --> 00:43:00.277]  We're living in insanely dangerous times.
[00:43:00.277 --> 00:43:06.140]  And I've told folks going back three months ago, I'm not buying storable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.021]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse.
[00:43:09.021 --> 00:43:16.364]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States.
[00:43:16.364 --> 00:43:17.905]  And it's even worse in the third world.
[00:43:17.905 --> 00:43:20.846]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it.
[00:43:20.846 --> 00:43:22.747]  But with the election fraud and the
[00:43:22.887 --> 00:43:23.207]  I think so.
[00:43:47.333 --> 00:43:51.336]  All right, we are back live and I'm really doing my best here not going into a rage on air because
[00:44:19.958 --> 00:44:26.183]  How we treat old people, and how we treat children, and how we treat babies, is who we are.
[00:44:26.183 --> 00:44:34.790]  And, um... I have confirmed, it's public, it's all over the damn news!
[00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:42.537]  But we knew this a few months ago, and Media Matters made jokes about it, oh, Jones claims they're killing old people in the nursing homes, bringing in COVID patients on purpose.
[00:44:42.537 --> 00:44:47.581]  Think about your default being covering up evil, and liking it, and thinking it's cute and funny.
[00:44:49.482 --> 00:44:53.565]  And Bill Gates up there about, yeah, we gotta get rid of the old people.
[00:44:53.565 --> 00:45:02.713]  Oh, you didn't get rid of your 95-year-old dad you got in a nursing home that's got some private palace?
[00:45:02.713 --> 00:45:08.337]  Oh, that useful senior, he didn't go anywhere.
[00:45:08.337 --> 00:45:12.421]  You better believe they're not taking COVID-19 patients and sticking it next to Bill Gates Sr.
[00:45:17.728 --> 00:45:32.951]  And when you study evil, how these big corporations sit there like bean counters and figure out a whole plan, they go to these big global councils, they all vote and decide on what the best scam is, but helps all of their organizations, and you got COVID-19.
[00:45:32.951 --> 00:45:46.934]  Because it helps the global government, the digital tattoo, the surveillance state, the tattletale state, the medical tyranny, the forced inoculations, the global government, so the UN runs it, I mean,
[00:45:48.251 --> 00:45:55.954]  I turn on local news, radio, TV, newspaper, it is just, the UN is beyond platinum, man.
[00:45:55.954 --> 00:46:02.296]  I used to hear the Pope spoke from the throne, ex-cathedra.
[00:46:02.296 --> 00:46:09.098]  Well, when it comes out of the mouth of the WHO, man, it's like it came out of Jesus' mouth, according to these people.
[00:46:14.028 --> 00:46:25.655]  And then everything that comes out of their mouth is a corrupt, lying fraud, allied with the most murderous regimes the planet has ever seen!
[00:46:25.655 --> 00:46:30.098]  And man, I mean, I look at that governor up there that on purpose sends people infected to nursing homes.
[00:46:30.098 --> 00:46:32.719]  I mean, that's like the default thing you don't do.
[00:46:32.719 --> 00:46:37.302]  Like, don't throw a newborn baby in the deep end of the pool.
[00:46:37.302 --> 00:46:39.063]  And she's got the baby, throwing it right in the pool.
[00:46:39.063 --> 00:46:42.265]  It's like, don't go in a fireworks factory with a flamethrower lit.
[00:46:43.404 --> 00:46:46.391]  Don't pour gasoline on yourself and light it!
[00:46:46.391 --> 00:46:49.258]  Don't jump in the backyard with 15 starving pit bulls!
[00:46:49.258 --> 00:46:52.346]  Don't go to the local zoo and climb in the Bengal tiger cage!
[00:46:53.208 --> 00:46:56.149]  I mean, don't take a bottle of cyanide!
[00:46:56.149 --> 00:46:57.750]  Don't chop your dick off!
[00:46:57.750 --> 00:47:01.632]  Excuse me, but this is ridiculous!
[00:47:01.632 --> 00:47:17.199]  The default position is keep infectious patients away from the nursing homes and Democrats in unison and globalists from Europe to Australia to the United States, ship them in there to call their asses!
[00:47:20.236 --> 00:47:22.597]  Bunch of murderin' scum!
[00:47:22.597 --> 00:47:24.158]  Seein' what they can get away with.
[00:47:24.158 --> 00:47:26.079]  You're like, well maybe they're just stupid.
[00:47:26.079 --> 00:47:29.681]  That's why they run their mouth about killin' old people all day!
[00:47:29.681 --> 00:47:31.782]  They don't wanna just kill those old people!
[00:47:31.782 --> 00:47:36.024]  They wanna kill everybody!
[00:47:36.024 --> 00:47:39.626]  And I'm not gonna sit here and take it!
[00:47:39.626 --> 00:47:40.407]  So I've been pissed.
[00:47:41.465 --> 00:47:44.886]  I've been really pissed behind the scenes because I haven't been really telling you what I really think.
[00:47:44.886 --> 00:47:46.947]  These people are murdering us.
[00:47:46.947 --> 00:47:57.930]  And I tell you, we sit there and put up with them killing these unborn babies and these little kids and keeping these babies alive and taking their organs and killing all these old people!
[00:47:57.930 --> 00:48:00.731]  We deserve whatever the hell we get.
[00:48:00.731 --> 00:48:05.292]  And let me tell you, we're gonna get it.
[00:48:05.292 --> 00:48:07.973]  But man, I look at the eyes of that governor.
[00:48:07.973 --> 00:48:09.314]  That woman's the most evil looking person.
[00:48:09.314 --> 00:48:10.454]  She's more evil looking than Hillary Clinton.
[00:48:11.903 --> 00:48:16.065]  People say, I mean, if you have any discernment, you see the evil.
[00:48:16.065 --> 00:48:19.667]  Some people go, watch Jones, she and Brian Stelter that looks evil.
[00:48:19.667 --> 00:48:20.528]  Are you joking?
[00:48:20.528 --> 00:48:25.631]  Pull up the governor of Michigan, just a random photo of her on screen with those crazy eyes.
[00:48:25.631 --> 00:48:27.992]  You watch her, you think, oh, that's just a crazy photo.
[00:48:27.992 --> 00:48:29.173]  Every video, she's just...
[00:48:35.489 --> 00:48:36.550]  I mean, look at her!
[00:48:36.550 --> 00:48:38.091]  My God!
[00:48:38.091 --> 00:48:40.313]  And then they stealth her!
[00:48:40.313 --> 00:48:43.516]  These are bad people!
[00:48:43.516 --> 00:48:46.598]  That's a murderer right there!
[00:48:46.598 --> 00:48:47.659]  That is a murderer!
[00:48:47.659 --> 00:48:53.524]  Now that is a disgusting... Oh, look at that boy!
[00:48:53.524 --> 00:48:54.685]  Look out!
[00:48:54.685 --> 00:48:57.027]  He's a-comin'!
[00:48:57.027 --> 00:48:59.409]  Woo!
[00:48:59.409 --> 00:48:59.809]  Man!
[00:49:01.052 --> 00:49:04.254]  That ought to run a chill up your spine, I don't know what does!
[00:49:04.254 --> 00:49:06.254]  Or you don't have any discernment!
[00:49:06.254 --> 00:49:09.896]  It's like in Lord of the Rings, Sting the Goblin Cleaver.
[00:49:09.896 --> 00:49:13.798]  That sucker lights up white-hot blue when goblins are around.
[00:49:13.798 --> 00:49:15.999]  Well, let me tell you.
[00:49:15.999 --> 00:49:20.041]  You can take one look at those people and lock up your kids, folks.
[00:49:20.041 --> 00:49:21.762]  Lock up your doors.
[00:49:21.762 --> 00:49:29.746]  And grab your ass with both hands, because they're coming for you.
[00:49:29.746 --> 00:49:30.546]  God help us, man.
[00:49:32.005 --> 00:49:36.410]  That's not human, folks, that's a demon!
[00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:38.472]  And I just get upset around these people.
[00:49:38.472 --> 00:49:39.513]  Oh, look at that!
[00:49:39.513 --> 00:49:42.276]  Look at that demon, boy!
[00:49:42.276 --> 00:49:43.537]  Woo!
[00:49:43.537 --> 00:49:45.299]  That's bad news right there!
[00:49:45.299 --> 00:49:51.985]  Ooh, look at that face!
[00:49:51.985 --> 00:49:52.926]  That is a predator!
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:50:00.423]  That wants to do one thing and she, or even when it came out two months ago, don't put sick people in the nursing homes.
[00:50:00.423 --> 00:50:03.705]  She said, we're sending the COVID patients to the nursing homes.
[00:50:03.705 --> 00:50:10.868]  Again, that's like, well, it's like sending disease into the most weak group.
[00:50:10.868 --> 00:50:11.949]  It's exactly what it is.
[00:50:11.949 --> 00:50:16.831]  I mean, it is, it is default.
[00:50:16.831 --> 00:50:19.393]  Don't stick your finger in a light socket.
[00:50:19.393 --> 00:50:20.093]  All right, I'm going to stop.
[00:50:23.370 --> 00:50:28.154]  They let all these articles come out and say that I'm making it up, the Bill and Melinda Gates finance, the digital tattoo under the skin.
[00:50:28.154 --> 00:50:35.339]  And they try to apples and oranges it with another global ID they have that could be chips or bracelets or watches or phones.
[00:50:35.339 --> 00:50:40.623]  And they try to say it's not happening, but we actually have Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation people on video saying they're doing it.
[00:50:40.623 --> 00:50:42.124]  And we're just going to play that for you next hour.
[00:50:42.124 --> 00:50:45.587]  They open the phones up and Max Keiser and Paul Watson are coming on.
[00:50:45.587 --> 00:50:49.850]  So that's all coming up, but you know, it's just amazing how they play these damn games.
[00:50:51.275 --> 00:50:54.319]  Oh, nobody wants your guns, they just take your guns everywhere they get control.
[00:50:54.319 --> 00:50:57.644]  Now they're like, yeah, we want all your guns, we're gonna take them all.
[00:50:57.644 --> 00:50:59.667]  Oh, by the way, we're promoting pedophilia while we're at it.
[00:51:00.743 --> 00:51:12.816]  By the way, we're going to take people that have a really dangerous pneumonia, and we're going to stick them with old people, the number one target group that can kill them, so we can jack those death numbers up, and while we're doing it, we're going to get a big old piece of money off that.
[00:51:12.816 --> 00:51:21.185]  You know, some thug gangbanger goes and kills an old person in their house for $1,000 of jewelry, and man, we send their ass to the
[00:51:22.062 --> 00:51:22.903]  Death Chamber.
[00:51:22.903 --> 00:51:25.404]  We send them to the lethal injection and we should.
[00:51:25.404 --> 00:51:37.231]  But boy, when the government and those corporations and the Democrats roll up their sleeves and go to town on some old people to make 50-something thousand dollars off of everyone they murder!
[00:51:37.231 --> 00:51:38.111]  Murder!
[00:51:38.111 --> 00:51:38.972]  Murder!
[00:51:38.972 --> 00:51:39.812]  Murder!
[00:51:39.812 --> 00:51:40.653]  Murder!
[00:51:40.653 --> 00:51:41.313]  Murder!
[00:51:41.313 --> 00:51:42.154]  Redrum!
[00:51:42.154 --> 00:51:42.994]  Redrum!
[00:51:42.994 --> 00:51:43.814]  Redrum!
[00:51:43.814 --> 00:51:44.515]  Redrum!
[00:51:44.515 --> 00:51:47.897]  They're murdering us and we just sit here and we put up with it!
[00:51:55.879 --> 00:51:57.679]  Get your ass!
[00:51:57.679 --> 00:52:00.680]  What's wrong with people?
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:05.721]  They're killing people all over the damn country, hundreds of them a day, to jack their numbers up.
[00:52:05.721 --> 00:52:07.581]  These people aren't a political party.
[00:52:07.581 --> 00:52:20.584]  They're a group of satanic demons who've promoted worse and worse people into power positions, where you now watch a Democrat event, and men, women, black, white, old, young, they're all... I mean, they're like...
[00:52:21.696 --> 00:52:25.557]  A movie where gremlins attack and they all run out with evil guns.
[00:52:25.557 --> 00:52:31.860]  And you're like, this is ridiculous.
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:34.180]  So, I don't like being under them.
[00:52:34.180 --> 00:52:35.461]  I don't like being their slave.
[00:52:35.461 --> 00:52:38.742]  And let's just say it, we're all caught in their thing right now.
[00:52:38.742 --> 00:52:40.322]  I don't like it.
[00:52:40.322 --> 00:52:46.565]  I don't like the fact that they're, these Lilliputians are tying me down and tying you down.
[00:52:46.565 --> 00:52:47.285]  Right now!
[00:52:48.985 --> 00:52:51.206]  They are tying you down!
[00:52:51.206 --> 00:52:53.187]  And they think it's funny!
[00:52:53.187 --> 00:52:55.669]  Well, I don't think it's funny, and I'm gonna break free!
[00:52:55.669 --> 00:52:59.611]  And I need you to break free with me.
[00:52:59.611 --> 00:53:00.231]  I'm gonna break.
[00:53:00.231 --> 00:53:00.711]  I got a plug.
[00:53:00.711 --> 00:53:04.814]  We won't be here.
[00:53:04.814 --> 00:53:06.895]  We've got this, uh, special running.
[00:53:08.257 --> 00:53:10.018]  The Memorial Day Special!
[00:53:10.018 --> 00:53:12.639]  And it's a lot of great products, and you need it.
[00:53:12.639 --> 00:53:16.181]  These are all things these murdering trash don't want you to know are essential.
[00:53:16.181 --> 00:53:18.563]  These murdering pieces of maggot filth.
[00:53:18.563 --> 00:53:20.364]  They don't want you to get DNA Force Plus, 50% off.
[00:53:20.364 --> 00:53:21.704]  Vaso Beaks, 50% off.
[00:53:21.704 --> 00:53:22.124]  X2, 50% off.
[00:53:22.124 --> 00:53:22.925]  Turbo Force, 50% off.
[00:53:22.925 --> 00:53:24.386]  Ultimate Krill Oil, 50% off.
[00:53:24.386 --> 00:53:25.246]  Survival Shield X3, 60% off.
[00:53:25.246 --> 00:53:26.647]  Living Defense, 50% off.
[00:53:26.647 --> 00:53:27.067]  Knockout, 50% off.
[00:53:37.492 --> 00:53:42.395]  Rainforce Plus is our number one most popular product from units sold.
[00:53:42.395 --> 00:53:49.981]  We don't make much money on it because it's low price, but it's high quality.
[00:53:49.981 --> 00:53:51.942]  You hear me, globalists?
[00:53:51.942 --> 00:53:58.446]  I know you're already murdering everybody and you think it's funny, but you're gonna get your asses handed to you.
[00:53:58.446 --> 00:54:01.008]  I can feel the death and the evil!
[00:54:01.008 --> 00:54:02.649]  Makes me sick!
[00:54:02.649 --> 00:54:03.730]  Makes me... I can feel it!
[00:54:03.730 --> 00:54:04.511]  Can't you feel it?
[00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:10.612]  He ended up to kill all the little babies, now they gotta kill grandma and beat their brains out!
[00:54:10.612 --> 00:54:14.154]  Stick a fork in them and suck a bunch of money out of us!
[00:54:14.154 --> 00:54:21.737]  And we're just gonna sit here and let that governor piss all over us, squat down that witch, get down on our knees and piss right in our face!
[00:54:21.737 --> 00:54:25.798]  We're gonna say, oh thank you, you big, ugly, stinking murderer!
[00:54:25.798 --> 00:54:28.139]  Oh, you big, fat-ass piece of coal!
[00:54:28.139 --> 00:54:30.640]  Thank you for destroying all these people!
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.121]  We love you, you maggot!
[00:54:33.086 --> 00:54:40.890]  Thank you for saving us, you hero, from Bill Gates' COVID-19, you fat, swollen wart!
[00:54:40.890 --> 00:54:41.750]  Maybe I shouldn't be on air.
[00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:45.873]  This is what I really feel like, who I really am!
[00:54:45.873 --> 00:54:48.194]  This is the end, my friends.
[00:54:48.194 --> 00:54:50.335]  My only friends, the end.
[00:54:50.335 --> 00:54:52.876]  Of our elaborate plans, the end.
[00:54:52.876 --> 00:54:56.038]  Of everything that stands, the end.
[00:54:56.038 --> 00:54:57.138]  The safety.
[00:54:57.138 --> 00:54:57.739]  The delusion.
[00:54:58.669 --> 00:55:00.850]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:55:00.850 --> 00:55:04.051]  Because it was only the mirage of safety.
[00:55:04.051 --> 00:55:07.653]  Movies and partying and living like children.
[00:55:07.653 --> 00:55:10.374]  Never growing up, never caring about other people.
[00:55:10.374 --> 00:55:14.075]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[00:55:14.075 --> 00:55:17.037]  Just like the history books show us, just like the Bible states.
[00:55:17.037 --> 00:55:22.119]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought into captivity.
[00:55:23.049 --> 00:55:30.071]  Because their people sold out to special interests and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved.
[00:55:30.071 --> 00:55:32.131]  We are repeating that again today.
[00:55:32.131 --> 00:55:38.053]  Compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage.
[00:55:38.053 --> 00:55:40.753]  Infowars has decided to fight for freedom.
[00:55:40.753 --> 00:55:44.034]  Infowars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[00:55:45.882 --> 00:55:47.484]  Memorial Day is here.
[00:55:47.484 --> 00:55:49.667]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year.
[00:55:49.667 --> 00:55:54.453]  And we were already running a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.
[00:55:54.453 --> 00:56:03.065]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale, and then five items that weren't on sale that we got back in stock, they're also massively discounted as well.
[00:56:03.385 --> 00:56:04.967]  For the Memorial Day Special.
[00:56:04.967 --> 00:56:05.908]  So here it is.
[00:56:05.908 --> 00:56:08.450]  Super Mel Vitality, 40% off.
[00:56:08.450 --> 00:56:10.672]  Knock Out, the Great Sleep Pig, 50% off.
[00:56:10.672 --> 00:56:13.095]  Brain Force Plus, hadn't been on sale for almost 6 months.
[00:56:13.095 --> 00:56:14.917]  It is 50% off.
[00:56:14.917 --> 00:56:17.359]  Bio Dru Selenium, 60% off.
[00:56:17.359 --> 00:56:20.122]  Chill Forge, it's incredible, 60% off.
[00:56:20.122 --> 00:56:24.066]  And you've got all these other items on sale as well until they sell out.
[00:56:24.366 --> 00:56:26.027]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show!
[00:57:05.103 --> 00:57:07.726]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:57:07.726 --> 00:57:13.631]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[00:57:13.631 --> 00:57:25.723]  Alright folks, I've been wanting to release that for about two months on air, and I just went ahead and went ahead and was honest with you.
[00:57:25.723 --> 00:57:26.623]  We're being suffocated.
[00:57:26.623 --> 00:57:27.624]  We're being strangled.
[00:57:28.881 --> 00:57:30.726]  And we're being killed.
[00:57:30.726 --> 00:57:33.294]  And these people are just getting away with stuff never foreseen.
[00:57:33.294 --> 00:57:34.738]  It's their wish list.
[00:57:34.738 --> 00:57:36.303]  It's a giant bioethics test.
[00:57:37.796 --> 00:57:40.518]  To see what they can get hospital workers and the public to go along with.
[00:57:40.518 --> 00:57:43.901]  It's the hospital workers that are the most awake group out there I've seen.
[00:57:43.901 --> 00:57:45.082]  They're like, we're empty.
[00:57:45.082 --> 00:57:47.544]  We're told to put people that didn't die of COVID on the COVID list.
[00:57:47.544 --> 00:57:48.605]  We get a bunch of money.
[00:57:48.605 --> 00:57:51.447]  We're all getting bonuses, but we're told to shut our mouths.
[00:57:51.447 --> 00:57:57.092]  I could open the phones up right now and take medical worker after medical worker after medical worker.
[00:57:57.092 --> 00:57:58.433]  But see, the globalists are smart.
[00:57:58.433 --> 00:58:01.435]  They go, oh, you don't like the medical workers.
[00:58:01.435 --> 00:58:02.216]  They're heroes.
[00:58:02.216 --> 00:58:04.538]  Well, on an average day, EMTs,
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:11.903]  Uh, trauma nurses, you name it, it's a tough job and they are hard working folks.
[00:58:11.903 --> 00:58:19.507]  Make no damn mistake, I watched my dad just doing oral surgery and dentistry half kill himself with all those patients and how stressful that work was.
[00:58:19.507 --> 00:58:25.850]  That's nothing compared to EMTs and people and police that see, you know, kids dead and car wrecks and stuff.
[00:58:25.850 --> 00:58:27.010]  That'll change you forever.
[00:58:27.010 --> 00:58:31.933]  Nobody said there weren't heroes in the medical system, but there's an evil system taking it over.
[00:58:33.493 --> 00:58:39.396]  And there's this decision that old people don't have value, so let's just kill them, snake a tube down their throat.
[00:58:39.396 --> 00:58:45.359]  No one is going to kill them because you're being paid to slowly murder them.
[00:58:45.359 --> 00:58:47.340]  But so they test positive for COVID-19.
[00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:49.861]  Let's play this video.
[00:58:49.861 --> 00:58:57.465]  They put individuals in there who was a patient put there by the governor of Michigan.
[00:58:59.332 --> 00:59:17.360]  Because that's what you're supposed to do with a 20-year-old individual who's not even sick, is sticking in with the old people so that Jaden Hayden can be another patient they make money off of.
[00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:17.740]  Here it is.
[00:59:39.656 --> 00:59:44.859]  So that is not a nurse, that is a patient put in there by the governor.
[00:59:44.859 --> 00:59:49.102]  And by the way, it's on record, the governor ordered this.
[00:59:49.102 --> 00:59:58.228]  Mentally ill people, my guy's obviously completely mentally ill, beating the living snot out of old people, choking old women, punching old women in the throat.
[00:59:58.228 --> 01:00:01.511]  This is an old man.
[01:00:01.511 --> 01:00:03.412]  And then he posts this is just black supremacy.
[01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:11.572]  I mean, this is absolute mental illness.
[01:00:11.572 --> 01:00:17.655]  But you know that if it had been a white person doing that, they'd have said, oh, this is what white people do.
[01:00:17.655 --> 01:00:23.698]  But when this guy does it, we go, oh, he's mentally ill, because the guy's completely stark raving lunatic.
[01:00:23.698 --> 01:00:24.679]  Probably has about an A.D.I.Q.
[01:00:25.964 --> 01:00:27.645]  Probably from vaccines.
[01:00:27.645 --> 01:00:29.306]  But that part doesn't matter.
[01:00:29.306 --> 01:00:46.354]  The point is, is that they're put a homicidal crazy person in a nursing home where he ran around for weeks posting videos of him drugging people, beating people, punching old women in the throat.
[01:00:46.354 --> 01:00:48.795]  This guy's not going to do too well in prison.
[01:00:48.795 --> 01:00:51.076]  And you know, I don't take any pleasure in that either.
[01:00:51.076 --> 01:00:53.397]  There's so many mentally ill sick people out there.
[01:00:53.397 --> 01:00:54.338]  But let me tell you who's guilty.
[01:00:55.430 --> 01:00:59.373]  All of us for allowing this type of crap to go on.
[01:00:59.373 --> 01:01:04.637]  That came out like a week ago and no one was even going to find out who it was so Judicial Watch went and filed a bill to find out.
[01:01:04.637 --> 01:01:05.698]  Because no one even cares!
[01:01:05.698 --> 01:01:07.439]  I mean, hell, I guess I didn't care.
[01:01:07.439 --> 01:01:09.341]  I mean, I thought somebody else would do it, right?
[01:01:09.341 --> 01:01:13.724]  Everybody's like, oh, somebody else!
[01:01:13.724 --> 01:01:23.172]  You had Detroit lawmaker critical of Governor Whitmer's nursing home executive order to put
[01:01:25.186 --> 01:01:37.228]  Sick people as COVID-19 response hubs, main treatment centers for people that aren't even from the nursing home.
[01:01:37.228 --> 01:01:38.368]  That's why I went crazy.
[01:01:38.368 --> 01:01:40.409]  I mean, because I already know all this.
[01:01:40.409 --> 01:01:41.049]  You already know all this.
[01:01:41.049 --> 01:01:46.070]  But when it hits you, when it hits you that they did all this premeditatedly.
[01:01:46.070 --> 01:01:47.390]  Oh, well, this is just ammonia.
[01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:50.691]  Well, let's kill off a bunch of these old people and get rich.
[01:01:50.691 --> 01:01:51.411]  I'm a woman, though.
[01:01:51.411 --> 01:01:51.831]  It's OK.
[01:01:51.831 --> 01:01:52.811]  I'm a woman governor.
[01:01:53.661 --> 01:02:01.408]  InfoWars has become a symbol, an emblem, of not just American freedom, but worldwide maverick spirit.
[01:02:01.408 --> 01:02:06.252]  It's not just myself or the host at InfoWars, or the researchers, or the journalists.
[01:02:06.252 --> 01:02:11.236]  It's you, the listeners, the activists, the people on the front lines, in the arena.
[01:02:11.236 --> 01:02:19.763]  It's the amazing guests and individuals that we interview that make InfoWars so special, because we're not putting a filter in front of free minds.
[01:02:20.123 --> 01:02:31.308]  We're having an open discussion about the real state of the world, not the establishment, the talking points that are put out by the Council on Foreign Relations, the Voldemort Group, the Davos Group, and other globalists.
[01:02:31.308 --> 01:02:39.471]  We're pushing for a pro-human future where we build a planet and beyond based on humans, for humans, by humans.
[01:02:39.471 --> 01:02:46.054]  Not a world where the establishment, who hate themselves, project their hate onto us and decide we're going to have a post-human world.
[01:02:46.054 --> 01:02:47.955]  I'm really excited to know that
[01:02:47.995 --> 01:02:48.436]  I don't know.
[01:03:05.393 --> 01:03:09.755]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:03:09.755 --> 01:03:12.536]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:03:12.536 --> 01:03:18.079]  Okay, you turn on any national news story.
[01:03:26.747 --> 01:03:29.768]  And you'll see articles going, it's insane.
[01:03:29.768 --> 01:03:32.369]  Bill Gates is a perfect little angel keg.
[01:03:32.369 --> 01:03:33.909]  He never wanted to get rid of old people.
[01:03:33.909 --> 01:03:35.709]  He never wanted to euthanize anybody.
[01:03:35.709 --> 01:03:37.830]  He never wanted to depopulate Africa.
[01:03:37.830 --> 01:03:39.170]  He never wanted to do anything.
[01:03:39.170 --> 01:03:48.053]  He never had vaccine problems with people getting killed from his vaccines, even though you can find all the mainstream articles and all the reports and all the admissions going back for over 20 years.
[01:03:49.727 --> 01:03:54.332]  And Bill Gates' dad running Planned Parenthood and Bill Gates saying there's too many people, we need to depopulate the planet.
[01:03:54.332 --> 01:03:55.633]  His main focus being Africa.
[01:03:55.633 --> 01:03:57.475]  That's the London Guardian headline.
[01:03:57.475 --> 01:04:04.262]  Bill Gates is really worried about Africa's overpopulation.
[01:04:04.262 --> 01:04:06.664]  And then it's like, oh well, we just, you know, get rid of people.
[01:04:06.664 --> 01:04:07.245]  That's what we do.
[01:04:08.547 --> 01:04:15.172]  Then, oh, but if a white person shoots a black person, questionably, sure, we should cover it, but it's like the end of the world.
[01:04:15.172 --> 01:04:18.914]  Tonight, the evil whites are trying to kill the black people.
[01:04:18.914 --> 01:04:21.056]  And who are the evil whites?
[01:04:21.056 --> 01:04:22.797]  They're those gun owners.
[01:04:22.797 --> 01:04:23.117]  Yeah.
[01:04:23.117 --> 01:04:26.980]  We need to take the guns from the white supremacists.
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:31.143]  Meanwhile, the real gun is a tainted inoculation.
[01:04:31.143 --> 01:04:33.725]  The real gun is a global depression.
[01:04:33.725 --> 01:04:36.487]  The real gun is not developing a third world and educating people.
[01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:41.270]  That's the gun pointed at them, and then the globalists are totally Malthusian.
[01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:43.272]  They use the gun against us.
[01:04:43.272 --> 01:04:46.754]  They collapse the third world and use it against us, and they admit that's their plan.
[01:04:46.754 --> 01:04:52.538]  So, there are all these articles out there about, oh, Bill Gates doesn't want to do anything.
[01:04:52.538 --> 01:04:53.098]  Why?
[01:04:53.098 --> 01:04:57.161]  Yes, he's got a patent, 2020-06-06-06.
[01:04:57.161 --> 01:05:01.284]  That's a global cryptocurrency for you to buy and sell.
[01:05:01.284 --> 01:05:05.287]  And it's a wristwatch or a phone or an app or a tattoo or a chip.
[01:05:06.161 --> 01:05:07.561]  Oh, but Jones says it's a chip.
[01:05:07.561 --> 01:05:22.804]  No, then he has another group he funded out of MIT that also has a digital tattoo, but it's a bunch of little spikes, little micro-needles that then put into your skin and break off in your skin, and then you can't dig the chip out because it's a hundred little chips.
[01:05:22.804 --> 01:05:23.524]  Literally.
[01:05:23.524 --> 01:05:25.964]  You can go look at the patent.
[01:05:25.964 --> 01:05:28.725]  So this is what they're funding.
[01:05:28.725 --> 01:05:33.626]  This is what they're doing.
[01:05:33.626 --> 01:05:35.166]  By the way, folks, they always say I'm sweating on air.
[01:05:36.158 --> 01:05:39.659]  The rest of this office is like an icebox.
[01:05:39.659 --> 01:05:43.921]  The only room they can't ever cool is the one I'm in, which is fine with me.
[01:05:43.921 --> 01:05:50.843]  But with these big TVs behind me and these lights, it's about 85 degrees in here, and I'm a big guy, and I start sweating, which is fine, because I'm real.
[01:05:50.843 --> 01:05:51.544]  I don't wear any makeup.
[01:05:51.544 --> 01:05:52.164]  That's how it is.
[01:05:52.164 --> 01:05:55.325]  But today, the AC's not working properly, so that's just the way it is.
[01:05:55.325 --> 01:05:57.266]  You'll have to have me up here like an old priest.
[01:05:57.266 --> 01:05:57.966]  You're getting all sweaty.
[01:06:03.046 --> 01:06:05.508]  We're sitting here looking at all this.
[01:06:05.508 --> 01:06:07.870]  They always play this game like, oh, there's no global government.
[01:06:07.870 --> 01:06:09.372]  Well, you just said you want a global government.
[01:06:09.372 --> 01:06:13.816]  Oh, that's a different global government than the one you're talking about.
[01:06:13.816 --> 01:06:19.081]  So an invisible quantum dot tattoo could be used to ID vaccinated kids.
[01:06:19.081 --> 01:06:21.082]  And it turns out that's from Science Alert.
[01:06:21.082 --> 01:06:23.465]  That's being funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:06:24.534 --> 01:06:26.355]  That's mainstream news!
[01:06:26.355 --> 01:06:34.718]  Bill Gates, MIT developed Tattoo ID to check for vaccinations, but they're saying it doesn't exist, so you don't mount a resistance to it.
[01:06:34.718 --> 01:06:40.061]  And so at the time you're at the clinic or wherever to get on the airplane or get a job, they're like, oh, it's a new type of shot.
[01:06:40.061 --> 01:06:41.081]  It's just a little sticker.
[01:06:41.081 --> 01:06:43.302]  We just roll it across you.
[01:06:43.302 --> 01:06:47.904]  You get a rash because they're little micro needles.
[01:06:47.904 --> 01:06:51.526]  And so you put your arm in a machine, it goes, bzzz, presses it down.
[01:06:51.526 --> 01:06:53.787]  The sticker comes back up, but now it's in your body.
[01:06:55.555 --> 01:06:56.715]  Did you hear what I just said?
[01:06:56.715 --> 01:06:58.576]  Little digital microchips.
[01:06:58.576 --> 01:07:03.617]  20 years ago, they could put all the books in the world on the head of a pen.
[01:07:03.617 --> 01:07:06.758]  Now they can put everything they want in one of those heads of a pen.
[01:07:06.758 --> 01:07:10.779]  And that's what this is, folks, into your body.
[01:07:10.779 --> 01:07:12.699]  Oh, they won't abuse that at all.
[01:07:12.699 --> 01:07:13.699]  It's all unfolding.
[01:07:13.699 --> 01:07:16.520]  And they've got the job of telling you everything's okay.
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:23.462]  So here's a clip from one of the Bill and Melinda Gates funded groups bragging about this digital tattoo.
[01:07:23.462 --> 01:07:23.722]  Here it is.
[01:07:26.095 --> 01:07:42.404]  In 2014, it was announced that Microchips Biotech, Inc., a company in Lexington, Massachusetts, had developed a new form of birth control, a wireless implant that can be turned on and off with a remote control and that is designed to last up to 16 years.
[01:07:42.404 --> 01:07:55.551]  According to MIT Technology Review, the idea originated when Bill Gates visited Robert Langer's MIT lab in 2012 and asked him if it would be possible to create an implantable birth control device that could be turned on or off remotely.
[01:07:56.724 --> 01:08:09.086]  Langer referred Gates to the controlled-release microchip technology he had invented and licensed to Microchips Biotechnology, and the Gates Foundation granted $20 million to the firm to develop the implants.
[01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:16.147]  Reducing population growth has, by Gates' own admission, been a core mission of the Gates Foundation since its inception.
[01:08:16.147 --> 01:08:24.169]  But in order to really understand what Gates means by population control, we have to look beyond the concept of controlling population size.
[01:08:25.464 --> 01:08:34.588]  At its most fundamental level, the population control the Gate speaks of is not birth control, but control of the population itself.
[01:08:34.588 --> 01:08:42.651]  The research, including Norplant, a contraceptive implanted under the skin of a woman's upper arm and effective for five years.
[01:08:42.651 --> 01:08:53.156]  In its 1988 report, the Rockefeller Foundation was pleased to announce that Norplant, which was developed by the Rockefeller-founded Population Council, was now approved for marketing in 12 countries.
[01:08:54.827 --> 01:09:05.834]  The Rockefeller's Population Council and other research organizations joined with the World Health Organization in 1972 to create a task force on vaccines for fertility regulation.
[01:09:05.834 --> 01:09:18.102]  By 1995, they were able to report progress in developing a... Now, we come back from the same piece that Corbett put out, titled Bill Gates' Human Control Grid.
[01:09:18.102 --> 01:09:20.004]  It actually shows MIT talking about how
[01:09:21.308 --> 01:09:23.430]  And now we've got this digital tattoo that just goes in.
[01:09:23.430 --> 01:09:25.191]  We did it for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:09:25.191 --> 01:09:27.413]  But that was a good primer for you.
[01:09:28.559 --> 01:09:39.384]  So that you can see how they're funding the implantable microchip movement directly, Bill and Melinda Gates with the documents, with the Rockefeller Foundation, which again just handed its baton to Bill and Melinda Gates.
[01:09:39.384 --> 01:09:42.986]  Because the Rockefellers didn't find somebody as hard-working as Bill Gates to carry on.
[01:09:42.986 --> 01:09:50.910]  David Rockefeller handed the baton to him about 15 years ago, as best we can tell, and so he runs the whole enchilada, he runs the whole show.
[01:09:50.910 --> 01:09:53.371]  So we have that, and then the reason I was prefacing all of this
[01:09:54.051 --> 01:09:57.832]  A new article by Jamie White just went up on Infowars.com.
[01:09:57.832 --> 01:10:02.434]  We have a five-minute video that deals with this.
[01:10:02.434 --> 01:10:03.915]  COVID Pass has come out.
[01:10:03.915 --> 01:10:07.356]  UK introduces digital health passport to monitor travel, health, and population.
[01:10:07.356 --> 01:10:09.037]  So China developed it with the globalists.
[01:10:09.037 --> 01:10:11.378]  They already had it ready on the shelf.
[01:10:11.378 --> 01:10:14.719]  And they talked about it in Event 201 last October, Bill Mullen and the Gates did.
[01:10:14.719 --> 01:10:20.141]  And so now it's all being rolled out, how wonderful it is, how good it is, and how much you're going to enjoy all that.
[01:10:20.141 --> 01:10:21.362]  So we have that clip for you.
[01:10:21.362 --> 01:10:22.042]  And the key clip,
[01:10:22.982 --> 01:10:31.485]  That is the video representation of them putting the chips into your body, with them telling you that it does not exist.
[01:10:31.485 --> 01:10:32.586]  We're going to go to break.
[01:10:32.586 --> 01:10:44.070]  Please remember that the Memorial Day sale is going to go a couple more days, and then it's going to have to end, because we've already sold out of the previous sale, Pollen Block, Vitamineral Fusion, Bodies, and All412.
[01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:47.431]  Hopefully those will be back in soon.
[01:10:47.431 --> 01:10:50.292]  But we're selling out soon of X3 Triiodine.
[01:10:51.232 --> 01:10:52.655]  Excellent, 60% off.

[01:11:32.469 --> 01:11:38.553]  You guys don't tell me, I've got to remember from memory here, because I'm starting to become a senile person, literally, from too much knowledge of what's happening.
[01:11:38.553 --> 01:11:46.638]  We've got the peppermint, and then we've also got the lavender, and then we've also got the eucalyptus, and that's amazing.
[01:11:46.638 --> 01:11:49.619]  8-pack PowerStack is the best deal.
[01:11:49.619 --> 01:11:51.661]  That's 13 pills taken in the morning and in the evening.
[01:11:51.661 --> 01:11:52.481]  There's a full spectrum.
[01:11:52.481 --> 01:11:54.302]  The very best deal we have.
[01:11:54.302 --> 01:11:54.522]  70% off.
[01:11:54.522 --> 01:11:57.024]  DNA Force Plus is the number one product I would take, other than X2.
[01:11:57.024 --> 01:11:58.245]  They're right up there together.
[01:11:58.245 --> 01:12:00.186]  They're both penultimate, but also numero uno.
[01:12:00.766 --> 01:12:01.047]  I think so.
[01:12:22.926 --> 01:12:26.768]  And yeah, I just am so pissed at these people attacking us and doing all this to us.
[01:12:26.768 --> 01:12:33.891]  And while they roll it all out, I mean, I told you years ago they'd have a global digital ID based on an outbreak because they were wargaming it and now it's all here.
[01:12:33.891 --> 01:12:37.613]  We'll have this amazing footage on the other side.
[01:12:37.613 --> 01:12:41.815]  Infowars.com, Newswars.com, Tomorrow's News Today.

[01:13:53.616 --> 01:13:59.082]  As I record this announcement, there's only one week left in the biggest sale yet of 2020.
[01:14:01.971 --> 01:14:02.331]  I think so.
[01:14:27.237 --> 01:14:35.724]  And Coke U10 can do for you, no matter how old you are, no matter what color you are, no matter where you live in the world, it works the same on everybody.
[01:14:35.724 --> 01:14:38.286]  It's known to be able to regrow nerves.
[01:14:38.286 --> 01:14:41.649]  It's designed so that your telomeres last longer.
[01:14:41.649 --> 01:14:46.252]  Doesn't make them grow, makes them shrink slower, which is basically the same thing.
[01:14:46.252 --> 01:14:51.357]  DNA Force Plus is 50% off for a limited time at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:14:54.989 --> 01:15:12.794]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:12.794 --> 01:15:15.255]  Survival of the fittest.
[01:15:15.255 --> 01:15:18.316]  The theory of species, Charles Darwin.
[01:15:18.316 --> 01:15:19.576]  Was it 50 years later?
[01:15:19.576 --> 01:15:21.377]  I redeveloped that in the 1850s.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:35.790]  That they rolled out the Theory of Social Darwinism, which is an excuse to do whatever you want to anybody, as long as you can get away with it.
[01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:37.332]  They're gonna steal big, sons.
[01:15:37.332 --> 01:15:38.613]  Steal super big.
[01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:44.982]  If you're still small, well, you don't get the respect of the controllers.
[01:15:44.982 --> 01:15:46.882]  That's their worldview.
[01:15:46.882 --> 01:15:50.204]  And they think everybody else is like them.
[01:15:50.204 --> 01:15:56.005]  They think people with morals and people that have courage, people that stand for something and build things are weak.
[01:15:56.005 --> 01:16:06.349]  But they're the parasites that have invaded and taken over the system that pro-humans of the human race of red blood built here on this planet.
[01:16:07.446 --> 01:16:09.908]  Forged from the iron of the earth.
[01:16:09.908 --> 01:16:12.230]  Gaston for the stars.
[01:16:12.230 --> 01:16:14.873]  The great test is here and is upon us now.
[01:16:14.873 --> 01:16:22.740]  So here's a clip from Corbett's great little documentary part three series Bill Gates Population Control Grid and
[01:16:23.737 --> 01:16:29.861]  He plays a clip from MIT and the companies they're working with, with these new chips that are like little pieces of glass.
[01:16:29.861 --> 01:16:31.983]  You ever busted a Coke bottle in your house?
[01:16:31.983 --> 01:16:34.204]  Or a beer bottle, and it's little tiny shards.
[01:16:34.204 --> 01:16:37.126]  You can't step on them and it's in the bottom of your foot.
[01:16:37.126 --> 01:16:42.470]  That's what these little silicate and carbon are, but they've got chips etched into them.
[01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:43.691]  Here it is.
[01:16:43.691 --> 01:16:49.935]  To investigate new ways to permanently store and record the vaccination information of each individual.
[01:16:49.935 --> 01:16:52.878]  The result of their research was a new vaccine delivery method.
[01:16:53.817 --> 01:17:10.006]  They found that by using dissolvable microneedles that deliver patterns of near-infrared light-emitting microparticles to the skin, they could create particle patterns in the skin of vaccine recipients which are invisible to the eye but can be imaged using modified smartphones.
[01:17:10.006 --> 01:17:18.490]  Rice University describes the quantum dot tags left behind by the microneedles as something like a barcode tattoo.
[01:17:18.490 --> 01:17:21.032]  So who was behind this development?
[01:17:21.032 --> 01:17:23.093]  As lead researcher Kevin McHugh explains,
[01:17:24.329 --> 01:17:29.716]  The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation came to us and said, Hey, we have a real problem.
[01:17:29.716 --> 01:17:32.099]  Knowing who's vaccinated.
[01:17:32.099 --> 01:17:35.304]  So our idea was to put the record on the person.
[01:17:35.304 --> 01:17:41.913]  This way, later on, people can scan over the area to see what vaccines have been administered and give only the ones still needed.
[01:17:42.811 --> 01:17:45.394]  Oh, it's your idea to get something inside somebody's body.
[01:17:45.394 --> 01:17:53.004]  There's MIT news, but I have a stack of news here I'll show you after this report we're about to play, where they say it doesn't exist.
[01:17:53.004 --> 01:17:54.987]  It's a conspiracy theory.
[01:17:54.987 --> 01:18:00.233]  And now, all over Twitter especially, the Facebook and Google platforms,
[01:18:01.141 --> 01:18:02.843]  YouTube, you name it.
[01:18:02.843 --> 01:18:07.529]  If you're not an approved source, mainline liberal, mainline conservative, it doesn't matter.
[01:18:07.529 --> 01:18:15.899]  If you're not an accredited source, you can't type in COVID-19 or pandemic.
[01:18:15.899 --> 01:18:18.662]  That's how they control now people questioning the whole hoaxes.
[01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:21.490]  Kaylen Bennett's doing a video on it.
[01:18:21.490 --> 01:18:25.752]  She can't even upload stuff to a bunch of platforms that says pandemic.
[01:18:25.752 --> 01:18:28.453]  They're not even checking what she says to agree with it.
[01:18:28.453 --> 01:18:30.934]  Not just banning Dockers, that was so last month.
[01:18:30.934 --> 01:18:33.955]  Not just banning Cedars-Sinai, that was so last month.
[01:18:33.955 --> 01:18:37.236]  No, now it's that you can't say pandemic.
[01:18:37.236 --> 01:18:39.757]  Ha ha ha!
[01:18:39.757 --> 01:18:40.858]  Just like that, see?
[01:18:41.986 --> 01:18:46.008]  Oh, but Trump's going to form a Blue Ribbon Commission to see if Hitler was a Nazi.
[01:18:46.008 --> 01:18:52.550]  Trump's forming a Blue Ribbon Commission when your house is on fire, you know, to see if we should send the fire department.
[01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:54.051]  I mean, this is too little, too late.
[01:18:54.051 --> 01:18:55.372]  It's a great failure.
[01:18:55.372 --> 01:18:58.133]  And Trump may be very surprised in 160 days.
[01:18:58.133 --> 01:18:59.693]  But here is COVID Pass.
[01:18:59.693 --> 01:19:04.035]  UK introduces digital health passport to monitor travel, health, and population.
[01:19:04.035 --> 01:19:08.117]  It's all just magically already built and ready, like we told you months ago, now rolling out.
[01:19:08.117 --> 01:19:08.457]  Here it is.
[01:19:09.810 --> 01:19:10.911]  Ahh... Oh, thank God.
[01:19:10.911 --> 01:19:11.131]  Ahh... SJW.
[01:19:39.950 --> 01:19:46.372]  Only an authorized user can create a digital code to pass healthcare passport on the platform.
[01:19:46.372 --> 01:19:48.613]  The steps are as follows.
[01:19:48.613 --> 01:19:55.375]  The authorized healthcare professional creates a new passport account by filling out the individual's unique data fields.
[01:19:56.175 --> 01:20:03.517]  If the user has pre-registered at home, the healthcare professional can simply scan the individual's pre-defined V-Code.
[01:20:03.517 --> 01:20:09.158]  They will automatically onboard the user to... Oh, now all my health data I've given it over to Big Tech to share!
[01:20:09.158 --> 01:20:10.278]  Oh, thank you!
[01:20:10.278 --> 01:20:10.718]  Attractive!
[01:20:10.718 --> 01:20:13.519]  ...designated COVID-19 test kit.
[01:20:13.519 --> 01:20:18.140]  By scanning the V-Code attached... Oh, another fake kit to boost the numbers!
[01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:20.201]  ...if a V-Code is not present.
[01:20:20.201 --> 01:20:22.601]  And then if we kill you later, we get more money.
[01:20:22.601 --> 01:20:25.522]  Mark yourself for death, please.
[01:20:25.982 --> 01:20:26.042]  Oh.
[01:20:26.042 --> 01:20:30.144]  When Bush used to talk about pit tortures, he'd go, well, these professionals, they're very professional.
[01:20:43.618 --> 01:20:47.762]  The Covipass Digital Passport is then assigned to the user's vCode.
[01:20:47.762 --> 01:20:48.983]  Covipass?
[01:20:48.983 --> 01:20:56.810]  An individual can use their Covipass Digital Passport by presenting their vCode either on their mobile... And you get special deals!
[01:20:58.118 --> 01:21:01.963]  Once scanned, you're on the Digital Gabba control grid!
[01:21:01.963 --> 01:21:02.343]  Awesome!
[01:21:02.343 --> 01:21:03.064]  Geolocation!
[01:21:16.921 --> 01:21:17.942]  Oh, tracking, you cunt!
[01:21:17.942 --> 01:21:20.003]  No, only the phone you're carrying around with all your personal data.
[01:21:20.003 --> 01:21:23.665]  We do not eat cows we butcher, only small pieces we butcher.
[01:21:23.665 --> 01:21:25.966]  So before they were worried about even metadata.
[01:21:45.737 --> 01:21:49.599]  Now it's like, it's only your name, health history, and how small your penis is.
[01:21:49.599 --> 01:21:50.419]  Oh, crowd management, oh!
[01:21:50.419 --> 01:21:50.579]  Oh!
[01:21:50.579 --> 01:21:54.101]  Oh, it's advised by the gov- it tells if you're too close to somebody, oh!
[01:22:10.569 --> 01:22:11.829]  That's what Netanyahu said.
[01:22:11.829 --> 01:22:14.310]  We'll all have a chip and... It face scans me faster!
[01:22:14.310 --> 01:22:16.070]  Is there a... Oh, a fluid crowd control.
[01:22:16.070 --> 01:22:17.211]  It tells you where to move.
[01:22:17.211 --> 01:22:18.311]  Your phone tells you.
[01:22:18.311 --> 01:22:19.711]  Oh my God, this is awesome.
[01:22:31.494 --> 01:22:33.995]  Who needs robots when they're turning you into one?
[01:22:33.995 --> 01:22:34.935]  Thank you, Kobe Pass!
[01:22:34.935 --> 01:22:35.735]  Thank you, Submitting Brats.
[01:22:35.735 --> 01:22:36.715]  Your submission is key to slavery.
[01:22:56.001 --> 01:22:58.067]  Wow, the symbol looks like a swastika too.
[01:23:03.115 --> 01:23:12.882]  If the full solution is not needed, the vCode scanning software and vPlatform API are available to developers by... Thank you, Covipass!
[01:23:12.882 --> 01:23:16.745]  www.vcode.it forward slash developers.
[01:23:16.745 --> 01:23:20.788]  For more information, visit us at www.covipass.com.
[01:23:20.788 --> 01:23:21.909]  Covipass.com.
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:38.653]  Of course, when there's giant rebel ships invading by the thousands a day, they won't be taking Covipass in the no-go zones, but you will, because you know how to submit.
[01:23:38.653 --> 01:23:41.316]  We'll be right back and give the number out.
[01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:42.737]  You saw MIT, though.
[01:23:42.737 --> 01:23:45.841]  They said Bill Gates wanted implantable chips.
[01:23:45.841 --> 01:23:47.222]  But they're liars.
[01:23:47.222 --> 01:23:48.964]  They're fake news like InfoWars.
[01:23:52.469 --> 01:23:54.970]  We're living in insanely dangerous times.
[01:23:54.970 --> 01:24:00.771]  And I've told folks going back three months ago, I'm not buying storable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[01:24:00.771 --> 01:24:03.731]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse.
[01:24:03.731 --> 01:24:11.073]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States.
[01:24:11.073 --> 01:24:12.613]  And it's even worse in the third world.
[01:24:12.613 --> 01:24:15.554]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it.
[01:24:15.554 --> 01:24:17.434]  But with the election fraud and the
[01:24:17.594 --> 01:24:17.894]  I think so.
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:44.770]  Dependent on them, they do not want you to be self-sufficient.
[01:24:44.770 --> 01:24:48.442]  Get your storable food at mfortworthstore.com right now while you still can.
[01:24:50.598 --> 01:24:51.979]  Now it's official.
[01:24:51.979 --> 01:25:13.134]  The United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency will last five years and the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of 10 people that you visit and if you go outside that list of 10 you'll be permanently detained.
[01:25:13.974 --> 01:25:25.578]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the new world order, where they let the criminals out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner.
[01:25:25.578 --> 01:25:30.180]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian, anti-human group.
[01:25:30.740 --> 01:25:38.266]  They have to put this electronic straitjacket on us before they carry out their endgame, which is global depopulation.
[01:25:38.266 --> 01:25:41.788]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[01:25:41.788 --> 01:25:49.114]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts, and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy.
[01:25:49.114 --> 01:25:51.616]  Wake up or die.
[01:25:51.616 --> 01:25:59.782]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[01:26:01.075 --> 01:26:05.819]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[01:26:05.819 --> 01:26:08.161]  Super Male Vitality!
[01:26:08.161 --> 01:26:17.029]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[01:26:17.029 --> 01:26:27.878]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[01:26:28.158 --> 01:26:28.859]  Yes.
[01:26:28.859 --> 01:26:33.763]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[01:26:33.763 --> 01:26:40.388]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[01:26:40.388 --> 01:26:41.729]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:26:41.729 --> 01:26:43.591]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[01:26:43.591 --> 01:26:46.413]  Never been a better time than right now.
[01:26:46.413 --> 01:26:54.000]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:56.662]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:15.274 --> 01:27:22.581]  Well, all over the world, people are wearing their Sharia-compliant headdresses.
[01:27:22.581 --> 01:27:23.182]  It's all a hoax.
[01:27:23.182 --> 01:27:25.224]  It doesn't protect you from the stupid COVID-19.
[01:27:25.224 --> 01:27:26.885]  I got the articles right here.
[01:27:26.885 --> 01:27:30.128]  Gunshot victims count as coronavirus deaths in Washington State.
[01:27:30.128 --> 01:27:31.049]  Here's the New York Times.
[01:27:31.049 --> 01:27:33.211]  Sixth name on the New York Times list of coronavirus victims.
[01:27:33.211 --> 01:27:34.953]  27-year-old man who was murdered.
[01:27:34.953 --> 01:27:35.754]  They don't care.
[01:27:36.536 --> 01:27:39.919]  It's all part of engaging in fraud.
[01:27:39.919 --> 01:27:45.765]  It's all part of saying 2 million would die and it's 100,000, almost all of them died of something else.
[01:27:45.765 --> 01:27:47.466]  500,000 died in the UK, not even 10% of that.
[01:27:50.287 --> 01:27:56.273]  So I'm going to open the phones up here for medical workers, doctors, nurses, healthcare providers.
[01:27:56.273 --> 01:27:57.314]  We'll go right to your calls.
[01:27:57.314 --> 01:27:58.655]  Give each person about a minute.
[01:27:58.655 --> 01:28:00.357]  I'm not going to make you hold long.
[01:28:00.357 --> 01:28:01.958]  Max Keiser pops in for like 30 minutes.
[01:28:01.958 --> 01:28:06.222]  We'll continue on with calls after that, but he joins us in the next hour for the first 30 minutes.
[01:28:07.725 --> 01:28:16.614]  The toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[01:28:16.614 --> 01:28:20.638]  Medical workers, doctors, nurses, virologists.
[01:28:20.638 --> 01:28:24.062]  We've done this probably 15 times or so the last few months.
[01:28:24.062 --> 01:28:27.846]  Every caller calls in and says it's a giant hoax, a giant fraud.
[01:28:29.096 --> 01:28:30.897]  Cops calling whose wives are nurses.
[01:28:30.897 --> 01:28:32.438]  They say the same thing.
[01:28:32.438 --> 01:28:33.839]  Empty hospitals.
[01:28:33.839 --> 01:28:35.400]  People watching Netflix all day.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:37.401]  And that's on the good side.
[01:28:37.401 --> 01:28:39.402]  Some hospitals are like orgies.
[01:28:39.402 --> 01:28:40.803]  That's just the way it is, folks.
[01:28:40.803 --> 01:28:42.624]  Doctors and nurses are very comfortable with their bodies.
[01:28:42.624 --> 01:28:43.485]  They're very promiscuous.
[01:28:43.485 --> 01:28:44.065]  It's well known.
[01:28:44.065 --> 01:28:47.287]  If you don't know about the medical field, you haven't been involved in it.
[01:28:47.287 --> 01:28:48.388]  But that's what's going on.
[01:28:48.388 --> 01:28:50.209]  I'm not attacking these people.
[01:28:50.209 --> 01:28:51.330]  The point is, is that
[01:28:54.426 --> 01:28:56.087]  Suicides are at record levels.
[01:28:56.087 --> 01:29:02.451]  They're reporting 80 plus percent increase in psychotropic drug prescriptions from psychiatrists.
[01:29:02.451 --> 01:29:05.353]  Of new customers since this started.
[01:29:05.353 --> 01:29:08.155]  Suicides up five-fold across the country.
[01:29:08.155 --> 01:29:09.436]  This is real, folks.
[01:29:09.436 --> 01:29:15.961]  People not being treated for pre-existing conditions is outpacing even the fake death numbers from COVID.
[01:29:16.821 --> 01:29:19.322]  But Stalin said, one man dies, it's a tragedy.
[01:29:19.322 --> 01:29:21.503]  10,000 dies, it's a statistic.
[01:29:21.503 --> 01:29:30.726]  They know how to focus in on each person and make it a huge deal and build it up like you're next to bring in that level of control.
[01:29:30.726 --> 01:29:32.686]  877-789-ALEX.
[01:29:32.686 --> 01:29:42.129]  We'll put the call system up on screen there and I will go to calls as soon as we're able to get them up and on the board here today.
[01:29:42.129 --> 01:29:44.290]  But here's a couple of important clips I want to get to.
[01:29:45.726 --> 01:29:48.807]  I'm not against the average Muslim.
[01:29:48.807 --> 01:29:50.208]  They're a human being with a soul.
[01:29:50.208 --> 01:29:52.209]  And a lot of them are great people.
[01:29:52.209 --> 01:30:00.772]  But the political systems of Islam are authoritarian and oppressive and anti-Western, anti-Christ.
[01:30:00.772 --> 01:30:06.494]  And you have the House of Islam, wherever Islam's in control, and outside of that is the House of War.
[01:30:06.494 --> 01:30:07.534]  And so it's non-compatible.
[01:30:07.534 --> 01:30:08.935]  But in Europe and in
[01:30:10.205 --> 01:30:20.013]  Now the United States, to a great extent, except for Trump, and especially in the UK, they're accepting the most cancerous forms of Islam.
[01:30:20.013 --> 01:30:29.581]  And so here's an Islamic call to prayer broadcast on loudspeakers in Great Britain that's been celebrated as political and spiritual diversity.
[01:30:29.581 --> 01:30:34.125]  Imagine if I bought a building in the middle of London and put a
[01:30:35.917 --> 01:30:41.059]  500 watt speaker on there and started talking about the New World Order, or about Jesus Christ.
[01:30:41.059 --> 01:30:44.200]  They'd come shut me down and say, hey, you don't have a right to do that in a public area.
[01:30:44.200 --> 01:30:53.163]  But from Michigan to Texas, from London to Los Angeles, from Rio de Janeiro to Berlin, there are call to prayers.
[01:30:53.163 --> 01:31:00.106]  I don't like to call them the Chinese, but they don't put up with that, because they know it's a group trying to take them over.
[01:31:00.106 --> 01:31:01.787]  Hey, CHICOMS, do your thing.
[01:31:01.787 --> 01:31:02.767]  Don't try to take me over.
[01:31:05.580 --> 01:31:10.301]  So here's Islamic Call to Prayer broadcast in London from a major building.
[01:31:10.301 --> 01:31:25.986]  Here it is.
[01:31:25.986 --> 01:31:28.787]  This is planting the flag.
[01:31:28.787 --> 01:31:30.007]  This is pissing on our grave.
[01:31:32.782 --> 01:31:38.505]  And they brag on the websites, like, oh, we've conquered them, they're so weak, our women are ours, and that's a big part of sex slavery.
[01:31:38.505 --> 01:31:40.907]  Because if you are not Islamic, you're a sex slave.
[01:31:40.907 --> 01:31:45.629]  I mean, let me tell you, the Muslims invented pimping.
[01:31:45.629 --> 01:31:48.751]  It's like, it's so cool they pimp-slap our women, whether they be black or white.
[01:32:03.677 --> 01:32:05.460]  Notice he doesn't adopt your dress.
[01:32:05.460 --> 01:32:06.722]  He doesn't, he doesn't want to.
[01:32:06.722 --> 01:32:09.926]  No, you're going to adopt what he's saying.
[01:32:09.926 --> 01:32:13.472]  Oh, by the way, unless you're from the right family.
[01:32:13.472 --> 01:32:17.978]  You know, under, under Islam, they say black people aren't humans and are quote, raisin heads.
[01:32:19.639 --> 01:32:20.999]  And that they deserve to be slaves.
[01:32:20.999 --> 01:32:32.042]  That's where the transatlantic slave trade... Christians had never interpreted the Bible that Ham and Cain and Abel, that blacks were like a... the mark of Cain was black.
[01:32:32.042 --> 01:32:34.882]  Christians never taught that until the Muslims taught us.
[01:32:34.882 --> 01:32:36.563]  And then we went, oh really?
[01:32:36.563 --> 01:32:41.384]  We can enslave black people because they're of Ham and they're of Cain?
[01:32:41.384 --> 01:32:42.344]  That's in the history books!
[01:32:43.390 --> 01:32:47.071]  The Muslims literally taught Europeans about slavery.
[01:32:47.071 --> 01:32:49.092]  And look, I'm not defending anybody doing it.
[01:32:49.092 --> 01:32:50.412]  It's bad.
[01:32:50.412 --> 01:32:53.353]  But I like to know where stuff came from.
[01:32:53.353 --> 01:33:01.376]  I mean, while Europe was abolishing slavery, because people were slaves in Germany and France and what's England or Scotland today.
[01:33:01.376 --> 01:33:04.617]  I mean, you have the elites, everybody else was slaves.
[01:33:04.617 --> 01:33:07.018]  I mean, you didn't do what you were told, you got killed.
[01:33:07.018 --> 01:33:07.698]  It's called feudalism.
[01:33:08.888 --> 01:33:13.031]  So Europe was about getting rid of slavery, but boy did we take the bait about 1500.
[01:33:13.031 --> 01:33:15.072]  Portugal and Spain.
[01:33:15.072 --> 01:33:17.034]  Which had just kicked the Muslims out.
[01:33:17.034 --> 01:33:27.601]  So kind of Spain and Portugal kind of picked up on that and went, well, blacks, you know, are cursed of God, and so we can do this to them.
[01:33:27.601 --> 01:33:30.783]  I mean, you know that's where that started, right?
[01:33:30.783 --> 01:33:36.227]  And it's in the Quran that black people aren't humans, and that's why
[01:33:37.935 --> 01:33:40.356]  Or they deserve what's happening to them.
[01:33:40.356 --> 01:33:45.600]  It's kind of that two-fifths, two-thirds human, all that stuff you've heard before.
[01:33:45.600 --> 01:33:48.621]  That all came out of this, and I'm not even attacking Islam.
[01:33:48.621 --> 01:33:51.523]  I'm just not going to sit here and play games with this.
[01:33:51.523 --> 01:33:55.466]  I want the Christianity of Jesus Christ.
[01:33:55.466 --> 01:34:03.290]  And what Martin Luther King said, we judge people off what they do and how they produce and what they stand for, not off what color they are.
[01:34:03.290 --> 01:34:04.251]  That's what we believe in.
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:15.286]  Well, according to the Shiites, you're not even have a seat at the table unless you're related to Muhammad.
[01:34:15.286 --> 01:34:15.986]  Okay.
[01:34:15.986 --> 01:34:17.467]  I mean, give me a break, man.
[01:34:17.467 --> 01:34:19.949]  Look at North Korea with a hereditary dictatorship.
[01:34:19.949 --> 01:34:22.230]  It's a joke.
[01:34:22.230 --> 01:34:28.774]  So here's the Lib Dem leader fasting for holy month of Ramadan in solidarity with Muslims.
[01:34:28.774 --> 01:34:31.036]  So this, this Dem Democrat leader over there,
[01:34:32.102 --> 01:34:36.463]  It's an early rise for me today as I prepare for my first ever fast in the holy month of Ramadan.
[01:34:36.463 --> 01:34:41.124]  I want to show solidarity with Muslims who are in isolation during this month.
[01:35:03.359 --> 01:35:08.883]  Which is this big, creepy, you know, lout.
[01:35:08.883 --> 01:35:15.969]  Is this here, oh, the Muslims, oh, I'm gonna virtue signal to them, oh, that I'm fasting.
[01:35:15.969 --> 01:35:17.250]  Oh, yeah, right.
[01:35:17.250 --> 01:35:19.452]  He'll be 20 pounds fatter at the end of it.
[01:35:19.452 --> 01:35:22.194]  Here, here, let's listen to this total capitulation.
[01:35:22.194 --> 01:35:24.235]  This leftist bending you over the barrel.
[01:35:24.235 --> 01:35:25.396]  Here it is.
[01:35:25.396 --> 01:35:28.819]  Show sold out to Muslims who are in isolation during this month.
[01:35:29.625 --> 01:35:36.289]  And this evening there'll be a Lib Dem Ifta when we have a virtual community meal together.
[01:35:36.289 --> 01:35:43.693]  So Ramadan Mubarak.
[01:35:43.693 --> 01:35:47.775]  Notice there's no family with that guy.
[01:35:47.775 --> 01:35:51.097]  Disgusting blob.
[01:35:51.097 --> 01:35:52.758]  Brian Stelter's cousin in the UK.
[01:35:52.758 --> 01:35:54.779]  I mean these people make me sick.
[01:35:55.947 --> 01:35:57.588]  But it's all about virtue signaling.
[01:35:57.588 --> 01:35:58.769]  Oh, we're here.
[01:35:58.769 --> 01:36:00.811]  Got a big welfare state for you.
[01:36:00.811 --> 01:36:01.631]  Come over here and rape us.
[01:36:01.631 --> 01:36:03.953]  We're going to come back with your phone calls.
[01:36:03.953 --> 01:36:07.096]  On the other side, we're talking to health care workers.
[01:36:07.096 --> 01:36:11.839]  We're talking to medical workers about your view on what's really happening, what your take is on all this.
[01:36:11.839 --> 01:36:14.241]  We're going to talk to Andy in Georgia.
[01:36:14.241 --> 01:36:17.324]  On the other side, and so much more today.
[01:36:17.324 --> 01:36:19.825]  And then Max Keiser is going to pop in, which is great.
[01:36:19.825 --> 01:36:22.608]  I like Max, but it's just a serious show on RT.
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:26.402]  If he does that show, we're going to have a nice discussion.
[01:36:26.402 --> 01:36:34.388]  If it just turns into like a Tourette syndrome of Bitcoin production promotion, I'm going to end it.
[01:36:34.388 --> 01:36:37.030]  Because I'm just, I'm out of gas, man.
[01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.811]  And I like Max Keiser.
[01:36:37.811 --> 01:36:39.512]  I like the Max Keiser on his show.
[01:36:39.512 --> 01:36:41.814]  The Max Keiser on my show, I don't like him.
[01:36:41.814 --> 01:36:43.035]  He needs to go away.
[01:36:43.035 --> 01:36:43.736]  So we'll see what happens.
[01:36:50.782 --> 01:36:53.403]  The United States is not Communist China.
[01:36:53.403 --> 01:36:56.305]  We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[01:36:56.305 --> 01:36:58.206]  We don't blow up churches.
[01:36:58.206 --> 01:37:01.367]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[01:37:01.367 --> 01:37:07.070]  But all over the news, we see the UN, Bill and Melinda Gates, WHO, mainstream corporate media.
[01:37:10.695 --> 01:37:18.280]  And if Communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people, well then, gee, we've got to do that.
[01:37:18.280 --> 01:37:23.943]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio passed laws saying we'll arrest you if you say Chinese virus.
[01:37:23.943 --> 01:37:27.105]  Well, now Cuomo in New York's calling it the European virus.
[01:37:27.105 --> 01:37:28.746]  These people are out of control.
[01:37:32.348 --> 01:37:37.575]  Because we the people are aware of their criminal activities and are exposing them and their power grab.
[01:37:37.575 --> 01:37:41.660]  The resistance lives at Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:47.607]  Spread those links and jam it down the censors' throats and then we'll be able to defeat their operation that much quicker.
[01:37:49.411 --> 01:37:51.012]  Memorial Day is here.
[01:37:51.012 --> 01:37:53.192]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year.
[01:37:53.192 --> 01:37:57.954]  And we were already running a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.
[01:37:57.954 --> 01:38:06.517]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale, and then five items that weren't on sale that we got back in stock, they're also massively discounted as well.
[01:38:06.897 --> 01:38:08.479]  For the Memorial Day Special.
[01:38:08.479 --> 01:38:09.420]  So here it is.
[01:38:09.420 --> 01:38:11.982]  Super Mel Vitality, 40% off.
[01:38:11.982 --> 01:38:14.224]  Knock Out, the Great Sleep Pig, 50% off.
[01:38:14.224 --> 01:38:16.627]  Rain Force Plus, hadn't been on sale for almost 6 months.
[01:38:16.627 --> 01:38:18.449]  It is 50% off.
[01:38:18.449 --> 01:38:20.891]  Bio Dru Selenium, 60% off.
[01:38:20.891 --> 01:38:24.294]  Chill Force, it's incredible, 60% off.
[01:38:24.294 --> 01:38:27.598]  And you've got all these other items on sale as well until they sell out.
[01:38:27.898 --> 01:38:36.481]  So, infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139 to get these items and take advantage of this Mega Sale Memorial Day.
[01:38:36.481 --> 01:38:38.142]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[01:38:38.142 --> 01:38:44.964]  We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supporting you and your family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[01:38:44.964 --> 01:38:46.485]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[01:38:46.485 --> 01:38:47.385]  We are all in this together.
[01:38:50.427 --> 01:39:01.435]  I was talking to my wife tonight and I was saying our economy slowing down and shutting down is like shooting a deer and it runs 100 yards before it knows it's been shot and then it finally dies.
[01:39:01.435 --> 01:39:08.641]  She said, well yeah, when I grew up in Omaha, Nebraska, one time there was an argument in the street and another man shot another man in the head.
[01:39:09.361 --> 01:39:19.685]  And the man that got shot in the head had blood pouring out of a huge hole, and he was holding it, and he walked around gibbering, talking nonsense for about 60 seconds, and then just fell over dead.
[01:39:19.685 --> 01:39:22.246]  Well, that's what's going to happen with our economy.
[01:39:22.246 --> 01:39:24.227]  It is in cardiac arrest.
[01:39:24.227 --> 01:39:31.870]  This has been done by design, and the UN, the chi-coms, the mainstream media orchestrated it, hyped it, and tried to keep the economy closed.
[01:39:32.450 --> 01:39:43.299]  So remember, the depression that's coming and the third world collapse is all on the UN, on Bill and Melinda Gates, on Obama, on Hillary, on Biden, on the Democrats.
[01:39:43.299 --> 01:39:49.384]  We tried to stop it, we tried to fight it, but you guys said you wanted to wreck America and the world, and now you've done it.
[01:39:49.384 --> 01:39:50.685]  Congratulations.
[01:39:50.685 --> 01:39:53.047]  I'm always excited about InfoWars life products.
[01:39:53.047 --> 01:39:58.152]  They're amazing, they're cutting edge, you love them, I love them, and they fund the InfoWars in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[01:39:58.993 --> 01:40:05.757]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[01:40:05.757 --> 01:40:13.421]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[01:40:13.421 --> 01:40:15.742]  And there's another innovation.
[01:40:15.742 --> 01:40:17.843]  It's the spray cap.
[01:40:17.843 --> 01:40:23.246]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality.
[01:40:23.246 --> 01:40:25.427]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[01:40:25.427 --> 01:40:26.348]  I like to put it on my hands.
[01:40:27.088 --> 01:40:28.589]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[01:40:28.589 --> 01:40:31.391]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so don't spray it right in your eyes.
[01:40:31.391 --> 01:40:32.972]  But I just love it.
[01:40:32.972 --> 01:40:35.794]  Personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[01:40:35.794 --> 01:40:37.595]  So, this is a real innovation.
[01:40:37.595 --> 01:40:44.119]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out.
[01:40:44.119 --> 01:40:45.480]  Smells great.
[01:40:45.480 --> 01:40:47.302]  It's so refreshing.
[01:40:47.302 --> 01:40:53.506]  This is a big winner.
[01:40:53.506 --> 01:40:56.127]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:13.544 --> 01:41:14.064]  Welcome back.
[01:41:14.064 --> 01:41:15.325]  I'm your host Alex Jones.
[01:41:15.325 --> 01:41:18.147]  Max Keiser is coming up and taking your calls right now.
[01:41:18.147 --> 01:41:19.627]  John is in Tennessee.
[01:41:19.627 --> 01:41:23.970]  He's a HCA manager of health care records for hospitals.
[01:41:23.970 --> 01:41:31.414]  I was just covering how the New York Times is putting out lists of people shot by guns, killed by cars, died of cancer.
[01:41:31.414 --> 01:41:32.995]  They're saying COVID-19.
[01:41:32.995 --> 01:41:34.216]  Washington State's been caught.
[01:41:34.216 --> 01:41:35.416]  It's all mounting.
[01:41:35.416 --> 01:41:39.779]  Why did major governors like Michigan and others under UN directives say
[01:41:40.239 --> 01:41:45.902]  Hey, I've noticed that there's a lot of information being shared that really scratches the surface of HIPAA violations, in my opinion.
[01:41:45.902 --> 01:41:52.466]  Like, I shouldn't be able to point at my neighbor and say, I think you've got anything.
[01:42:06.334 --> 01:42:08.455]  Yeah, we've got laws protecting our medical records.
[01:42:08.455 --> 01:42:10.515]  Now we're just told, oh, Big Tech's tracking you.
[01:42:10.515 --> 01:42:12.676]  Oh, all your medical records are public now.
[01:42:12.676 --> 01:42:14.516]  Yeah, it's sick.
[01:42:14.516 --> 01:42:18.657]  So that's changed somehow, because that's not an issue at all.
[01:42:18.657 --> 01:42:19.317]  Well, exactly.
[01:42:19.317 --> 01:42:23.238]  If you release something about who's in the hospital, you go to jail for 10 years.
[01:42:23.238 --> 01:42:26.219]  But now suddenly, it's just a bum rush on our final rights.
[01:42:26.219 --> 01:42:29.379]  I mean, that's all it is.
[01:42:29.379 --> 01:42:35.821]  I also wanted to mention, so specifically what I do is try to help the physicians get paid.
[01:42:36.798 --> 01:42:44.163]  About 180 hospitals or so.
[01:42:44.163 --> 01:42:52.589]  Cryptocurrency is pretty much what I do now, only it's the reverse.
[01:42:52.589 --> 01:42:56.972]  We wait for people to tell us what they did, and then we approve that work.
[01:42:56.972 --> 01:43:04.837]  They're going to reverse that in the cryptocurrency system, and they're going to hand out your tasks like a communist dictatorship where
[01:43:05.373 --> 01:43:07.715]  You're told what you're gonna do today, no matter what it is.
[01:43:07.715 --> 01:43:09.337]  You have to go kill somebody, that's what you gotta do.
[01:43:09.337 --> 01:43:10.879]  If you wanna get paid.
[01:43:10.879 --> 01:43:13.521]  You know, that's not the way it's supposed to work.
[01:43:13.521 --> 01:43:18.246]  You're supposed to tell us what you did today, and we're gonna approve that work, and then you might get payment.
[01:43:18.246 --> 01:43:19.708]  It shouldn't be the other way around.
[01:43:19.708 --> 01:43:21.950]  They're pre-paying everybody.
[01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:24.373]  It's gonna reverse everything, and I think it's a horrible idea.
[01:43:25.157 --> 01:43:26.377]  I don't know how we can avoid it.
[01:43:26.377 --> 01:43:29.778]  And again, that's in the patents, that's what's being pushed and promoted.
[01:43:29.778 --> 01:43:32.539]  Then they counter and go, oh, that's a conspiracy theory.
[01:43:32.539 --> 01:43:40.180]  What do you make of that, where they roll it out publicly, then they say it's a conspiracy theory?
[01:43:40.180 --> 01:43:52.263]  It's just a way to misdirect, to try to point, they're going to try to point the finger, I think you brought this up, where they are the heroes, and they come out smelling like roses that everybody wants to buy.
[01:43:52.745 --> 01:43:57.967]  I don't see how Bill Gates gets away with it, but he's gotten away with so much, that's why he just keeps doubling down like a psychotic criminal.
[01:43:57.967 --> 01:44:01.469]  It's interesting how he was quiet for so long, isn't it?
[01:44:21.007 --> 01:44:26.628]  He dropped off the software game and just went totally silent.
[01:44:26.628 --> 01:44:29.109]  You know, giving vaccines everywhere.
[01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:32.150]  And now he comes back into popularity somehow?
[01:44:32.150 --> 01:44:34.090]  Like now he's on every show?
[01:44:34.090 --> 01:44:36.311]  Telling us exactly what we're gonna do?
[01:44:36.311 --> 01:44:40.092]  He's suddenly our doctor, our father, our god, our king, our master, our lord.
[01:44:40.092 --> 01:44:40.692]  Not mine!
[01:44:40.692 --> 01:44:42.972]  But he wants to put things in our body.
[01:44:42.972 --> 01:44:45.433]  He really cares about us.
[01:44:45.433 --> 01:44:46.013]  No.
[01:44:46.013 --> 01:44:46.933]  Yeah.
[01:44:46.933 --> 01:44:48.313]  I will not be home.
[01:44:48.313 --> 01:44:49.354]  That's the only thing I can say.
[01:44:51.195 --> 01:44:54.998]  I don't know how we're supposed to avoid what's being brought down on us.
[01:44:54.998 --> 01:44:58.600]  Well, they're spoiling for a fight, but you know, Gates thought we would all just accept this.
[01:44:58.600 --> 01:45:00.342]  This is not his name.
[01:45:00.342 --> 01:45:03.324]  He's the most hated person in the world now.
[01:45:03.324 --> 01:45:04.725]  But he's, we don't even see him.
[01:45:04.725 --> 01:45:05.765]  We're not going to see what he's doing.
[01:45:05.765 --> 01:45:09.108]  The Marines are going to be delivering whatever it is he sells.
[01:45:09.108 --> 01:45:11.349]  We didn't even buy it.
[01:45:11.349 --> 01:45:12.310]  You know?
[01:45:12.310 --> 01:45:14.732]  No, that doesn't sound like a very healthy thing he's doing.
[01:45:14.732 --> 01:45:15.652]  Great point, sir.
[01:45:15.652 --> 01:45:16.213]  God bless you.
[01:45:18.857 --> 01:45:20.938]  Oh, he cried pandemic and it all came true.
[01:45:20.938 --> 01:45:23.499]  And his people even ran the lab it came out of.
[01:45:23.499 --> 01:45:27.781]  Wow, what a great guy.
[01:45:27.781 --> 01:45:30.222]  What a good person.
[01:45:30.222 --> 01:45:36.565]  Let's play former Van Halen front man, the Red Rocker, Sammy Hagar.
[01:45:36.565 --> 01:45:38.226]  I'm not locking down anymore.
[01:45:38.226 --> 01:45:44.609]  Then we're going to play coronavirus cover up is China's Chernobyl White House advisor.
[01:45:44.609 --> 01:45:47.530]  Robert O'Brien has to say, let's play those clips and go to more calls.
[01:45:48.666 --> 01:45:49.006]  We're good to go!
[01:46:13.055 --> 01:46:26.503]  If the damn thing wants to come and get me and kill me, let it be, because what more life isn't going to be any better from this day on for the rest of my life than it has been.
[01:46:26.503 --> 01:46:30.546]  And I swear to you, I came to grips with it, and I was not afraid.
[01:46:30.546 --> 01:46:35.329]  I didn't want to get anyone else contagious if I had it, but I don't have it.
[01:46:35.816 --> 01:46:37.116]  I mean, I don't have it, man.
[01:46:37.116 --> 01:46:38.657]  I'm healthy as a friggin' tick.
[01:46:38.657 --> 01:46:41.898]  So, I'm going, all of a sudden, I wasn't afraid of it anymore.
[01:46:41.898 --> 01:46:43.438]  And then I got jumped up about it.
[01:46:43.438 --> 01:46:52.261]  And then I said, this is bullcrap, people being afraid and staying away from their own children and their own parents.
[01:46:52.261 --> 01:46:57.522]  And it just took the love out of families, and I hate it.
[01:46:57.522 --> 01:47:01.123]  I don't say the word hate very much, but I hate this friggin'
[01:47:01.829 --> 01:47:06.832]  Coronavirus crap and I'm not afraid of it and I'm not locking down anymore.
[01:47:06.832 --> 01:47:08.433]  I'll go around to anyone.
[01:47:08.433 --> 01:47:10.174]  If you don't want to be around me, fine.
[01:47:10.174 --> 01:47:11.896]  You know, just stay, keep your distance.
[01:47:11.896 --> 01:47:16.599]  I'm all cool with that, but it's not like I'm against that, but I'm, I'm sorry.
[01:47:16.599 --> 01:47:19.801]  It doesn't, I have no fear at my age about it.
[01:47:19.801 --> 01:47:22.763]  And so how, how do you like that now?
[01:47:22.763 --> 01:47:27.886]  Now that I've known three, only three people out of the thousands of people that I know,
[01:47:28.590 --> 01:47:29.971]  Have got it.
[01:47:29.971 --> 01:47:38.195]  One guy is a very unhealthy 67 year old guy who got it, lasted 10 days and he's over it.
[01:47:38.195 --> 01:47:45.018]  A little, and his son, uh, nine years old, healthy as a tick, lasted four days and they were diagnosed.
[01:47:45.018 --> 01:47:45.539]  They had it.
[01:47:45.539 --> 01:47:48.140]  They went to the hospital, said, Hey, I'm feeling terrible.
[01:47:48.140 --> 01:47:49.581]  I got this terrible fever.
[01:47:49.581 --> 01:47:51.101]  Now I can, you know, my chest is tight.
[01:47:51.101 --> 01:47:52.302]  I'm coughing, coughing.
[01:47:52.302 --> 01:47:53.723]  They just gave him some antibiotics.
[01:47:53.723 --> 01:47:54.263]  Bang, bang, bang.
[01:47:54.736 --> 01:47:58.297]  And another guy in his 30s had got it and he was fine.
[01:47:58.297 --> 01:47:59.418]  He said it was a horrible flu.
[01:47:59.418 --> 01:48:00.918]  He said, it was miserable.
[01:48:00.918 --> 01:48:03.199]  You don't want to get it Sammy.
[01:48:03.199 --> 01:48:07.061]  So he goes, you know, five, six days later, I start feeling pretty good.
[01:48:07.061 --> 01:48:08.401]  And then it's totally over.
[01:48:08.401 --> 01:48:10.562]  So I'm saying, I don't know anybody that died for me.
[01:48:10.562 --> 01:48:11.822]  You read about people that died.
[01:48:11.822 --> 01:48:13.623]  So I'm just, I'm not afraid of it anymore.
[01:48:13.623 --> 01:48:15.284]  That's all I'm saying Kovacs.
[01:48:15.284 --> 01:48:16.624]  Everybody be their own self.
[01:48:16.624 --> 01:48:18.865]  I'm not trying to sway anyone, any direction.
[01:48:19.298 --> 01:48:22.259]  But Sammy Hagar, that guy that we're talking about.
[01:48:22.259 --> 01:48:23.539]  Oh, no, that we're talking to.
[01:48:23.539 --> 01:48:26.780]  Yeah, that we're talking to.
[01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:28.140]  But it is all a panic.
[01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:29.280]  It is all a fear.
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:30.080]  It is all a fraud.
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:35.001]  They're taking all the heart attack, all the cancer, all the car wreck, all the gunshots, all the flu.
[01:48:35.001 --> 01:48:37.542]  And they're putting it in that column to get money.
[01:48:37.542 --> 01:48:43.403]  And they're putting sick people on purpose who aren't even old at nursing homes to infect them.
[01:48:43.403 --> 01:48:45.083]  They're just seeing what we'll put up with.
[01:48:45.083 --> 01:48:46.724]  This is like, this is a sick joke.
[01:48:46.724 --> 01:48:47.564]  They're laughing.
[01:48:50.057 --> 01:48:51.598]  At us.
[01:48:51.598 --> 01:48:53.320]  And saying, you're guilty.
[01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:56.222]  When did you rape your wife last?
[01:48:56.222 --> 01:48:57.262]  When did you kill your neighbor last?
[01:48:57.262 --> 01:48:59.184]  They're like, oh, you could have it!
[01:48:59.184 --> 01:49:00.065]  Wear your mask!
[01:49:00.065 --> 01:49:02.626]  Show you're a hero!
[01:49:02.626 --> 01:49:06.449]  And it's all orchestrated by the very people that engineered this whole mess.
[01:49:06.449 --> 01:49:12.694]  Fauci and Gates and all these people.
[01:49:12.694 --> 01:49:16.097]  Derek in California, biomedical worker at a hospital on COVID-19.
[01:49:16.097 --> 01:49:17.257]  What's your view on the situation?
[01:49:17.257 --> 01:49:17.778]  Thanks for calling.
[01:49:18.852 --> 01:49:20.553]  It's a complete fraud.
[01:49:20.553 --> 01:49:21.814]  This hospital's been empty.
[01:49:21.814 --> 01:49:25.356]  The workers have been pulled off work.
[01:49:25.356 --> 01:49:27.217]  All of our hours reduced.
[01:49:27.217 --> 01:49:31.780]  This is a complete and utter hoax.
[01:49:31.780 --> 01:49:42.426]  People who say they've had the COVID-19 and have been around everybody and this contact tracing thing, which is getting a little bit out of hand here.
[01:49:42.426 --> 01:49:44.788]  It's a fraud.
[01:49:44.788 --> 01:49:46.309]  Healthy people can't get it.
[01:49:46.309 --> 01:49:47.970]  And if you have enough vitamin D,
[01:49:48.777 --> 01:49:53.823]  If you're out in the sun, like a good, strong, healthy person, a smart person, you're not going to get this.
[01:49:53.823 --> 01:49:54.744]  You're not going to get sick.
[01:49:54.744 --> 01:49:56.826]  There is no pandemic.
[01:49:56.826 --> 01:50:02.812]  There has been zero demonstrated scientific contagion around this.
[01:50:02.812 --> 01:50:07.738]  Nobody is following scientific protocols when it comes to contagion, when it comes to a virus.
[01:50:09.187 --> 01:50:14.469]  They're working at this institution here in California on that RNA vaccine.
[01:50:14.469 --> 01:50:17.950]  They are receiving the funds from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:23.991]  We get weekly updates on this and it's available to the public if you guys are interested in what they're doing here.
[01:50:23.991 --> 01:50:26.392]  There's BSL-3 going on.
[01:50:31.341 --> 01:50:38.928]  And all I want to say is people deserve to, one, get educated that there are cures for this, natural cures.
[01:50:38.928 --> 01:50:40.389]  One, ozone therapy.
[01:50:40.389 --> 01:50:42.111]  Ozone therapy isn't even brought up.
[01:50:42.111 --> 01:50:49.317]  If we look online right now you can find that there is a clinic in Spain that is doing O3 therapy with
[01:50:49.757 --> 01:50:54.701]  It's an immense success for anybody that is sick with this particular disease.
[01:50:54.701 --> 01:50:57.924]  And yet, it's against the FDA regulations here in the United States.
[01:50:57.924 --> 01:50:59.605]  Instead, it's the line from Caddyshack.
[01:50:59.605 --> 01:51:02.467]  Snag a tube down their throat and call me in five or six hours.
[01:51:02.467 --> 01:51:03.188]  But let's come back.
[01:51:03.188 --> 01:51:05.730]  I want to give you the floor, because you're obviously a smart person, Derek.
[01:51:05.730 --> 01:51:07.751]  Biomedical worker in a hospital.
[01:51:07.751 --> 01:51:09.493]  And I've got the articles here.
[01:51:09.493 --> 01:51:13.196]  A big article by Mike Adams is excellent on the whole.
[01:51:13.196 --> 01:51:15.297]  New, quote, DNA vaccines.
[01:51:15.297 --> 01:51:16.358]  The mRNA vaccines.
[01:51:16.358 --> 01:51:17.559]  We're going to come back in two minutes.
[01:51:17.559 --> 01:51:18.480]  We're going to go right to Derek.
[01:51:19.773 --> 01:51:25.995]  And then we've got Max Keiser popping, and then we'll go to Bob and Robin and Andy and DJ and everybody, and then Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:51:25.995 --> 01:51:29.757]  But listen, they're censoring this everywhere.
[01:51:29.757 --> 01:51:31.758]  Medical workers, scientists, doctors are being blocked.
[01:51:31.758 --> 01:51:34.239]  People saying anything against the narrative are being blocked.
[01:51:34.239 --> 01:51:35.739]  That's why this is so precious.
[01:51:35.739 --> 01:51:37.180]  It's why you spreading the word is king.
[01:51:39.358 --> 01:51:45.701]  I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen to a song and telling you all these horrible things.
[01:51:45.701 --> 01:51:49.842]  But you notice almost everything we've talked about, horrible, has come true.
[01:51:49.842 --> 01:51:53.624]  We were warning everybody to try to stop it.
[01:51:53.624 --> 01:51:58.226]  It's like telling somebody if you got a pool, put a fence around it if you have little kids.
[01:51:58.226 --> 01:52:01.047]  Because even if they're good swimmers, they can hit their head and drown.
[01:52:01.047 --> 01:52:03.368]  People don't listen, they go out and their kid's dead in the pool.
[01:52:04.048 --> 01:52:08.330]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is the death of the third world and the collapse of the first world.
[01:52:08.330 --> 01:52:12.172]  And this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalists.
[01:52:12.172 --> 01:52:14.793]  And they admit they've orchestrated it.
[01:52:14.793 --> 01:52:17.254]  They admit it's, quote, good to save the Earth.
[01:52:17.254 --> 01:52:19.195]  And they're teaching us to be more frugal.
[01:52:19.195 --> 01:52:24.137]  And they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy.
[01:52:24.817 --> 01:52:32.281]  I know all this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public because it's their operations manual.
[01:52:32.281 --> 01:52:41.606]  I wish this wasn't the case, but there really are evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions and we've got to stop them.
[01:52:41.606 --> 01:52:43.928]  This is the end, my friends.
[01:52:43.928 --> 01:52:46.049]  My only friends, the end.
[01:52:46.049 --> 01:52:48.610]  Of our elaborate plans, the end.
[01:52:48.610 --> 01:52:51.772]  Of everything that stands, the end.
[01:52:51.772 --> 01:52:52.872]  The safety.
[01:52:52.872 --> 01:52:53.473]  The delusion.
[01:52:54.386 --> 01:52:56.567]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:56.567 --> 01:52:59.788]  Because there was only the mirage of safety.
[01:52:59.788 --> 01:53:02.930]  Movies and partying and living like children.
[01:53:02.930 --> 01:53:06.091]  Never growing up, never caring about other people.
[01:53:06.091 --> 01:53:09.793]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[01:53:09.793 --> 01:53:12.774]  Just like the history books show us, just like the Bible states.
[01:53:12.774 --> 01:53:15.796]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God,
[01:53:16.772 --> 01:53:25.817]  They were brought into captivity because their people sold out to special interests that were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved.
[01:53:25.817 --> 01:53:27.878]  We are repeating that again today.
[01:53:27.878 --> 01:53:33.801]  Compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage.
[01:53:33.801 --> 01:53:36.483]  Infowars has decided to fight for freedom.
[01:53:36.483 --> 01:53:43.366]  Infowars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[01:53:43.366 --> 01:53:45.988]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:03.066 --> 01:54:03.586]  Welcome back.
[01:54:03.586 --> 01:54:04.767]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:54:04.767 --> 01:54:11.250]  Next segment, Ilhan Omar has come out and made a comment that dovetails with the Democrats.
[01:54:11.250 --> 01:54:13.812]  She doesn't care if Biden rapes women.
[01:54:13.812 --> 01:54:15.213]  He's a good guy.
[01:54:15.213 --> 01:54:16.453]  Well, we know, lady.
[01:54:16.453 --> 01:54:17.454]  You love Somali.
[01:54:19.195 --> 01:54:23.596]  Your family helped run criminal activities there.
[01:54:23.596 --> 01:54:25.716]  Now you're here in the happy hunting land.
[01:54:25.716 --> 01:54:28.957]  Derek is a very informed biomedical worker.
[01:54:28.957 --> 01:54:30.397]  You got four minutes till break.
[01:54:30.397 --> 01:54:31.077]  Four and a half minutes.
[01:54:31.077 --> 01:54:31.938]  You've got the floor.
[01:54:31.938 --> 01:54:35.818]  Tell us what you're witnessing out in California.
[01:54:35.818 --> 01:54:36.559]  Loads of fear.
[01:54:36.559 --> 01:54:37.499]  I see people with fear.
[01:54:37.499 --> 01:54:39.199]  I don't wear masks.
[01:54:39.199 --> 01:54:42.860]  And when I go to Costco and purposely don't walk in, the
[01:54:43.658 --> 01:54:46.962]  With a mask on, the workers, they don't say anything to me.
[01:54:46.962 --> 01:54:47.762]  Everyone looks around.
[01:54:47.762 --> 01:54:50.325]  The only people that put me down are other healthcare workers.
[01:54:50.325 --> 01:54:53.488]  They come in in scrubs and they say, you're not wearing a mask?
[01:54:54.901 --> 01:55:07.374]  They don't want to get into it with me, but also the farmers market, you can't really much do anything unless you're following the Santa Clara County health guidelines, which are pretty egregious against human rights.
[01:55:07.374 --> 01:55:16.984]  The most egregious thing I really strongly feel is this shutdown of churches because the power of prayer is a deep human
[01:55:18.050 --> 01:55:18.310]  Sure.
[01:55:39.235 --> 01:55:42.117]  How to use it growing up, that's a travesty.
[01:55:42.117 --> 01:55:48.602]  We all deserve to know that we can, in silence and solitude or wherever we are, we can always have a prayer active and going.
[01:55:48.602 --> 01:55:49.623]  And the globalists know that.
[01:55:49.623 --> 01:55:53.026]  They fight constantly to cut us off from that power.
[01:55:53.026 --> 01:55:56.008]  And 5G is about that.
[01:55:56.008 --> 01:56:00.232]  We're moving into a time right now where humanity is going to make a bump.
[01:56:00.232 --> 01:56:01.613]  And we're going to get a bump in light.
[01:56:01.613 --> 01:56:03.394]  And we have been getting bumps in light.
[01:56:03.394 --> 01:56:05.576]  And look what they do to the skies.
[01:56:06.365 --> 01:56:09.527]  They're coating them with chemicals over here in California.
[01:56:09.527 --> 01:56:12.608]  It just disgusts me and I weep to see that.
[01:56:12.608 --> 01:56:13.649]  That should be classified.
[01:56:13.649 --> 01:56:18.591]  There is a global darkening project that's made the earth 30% darker.
[01:56:18.591 --> 01:56:18.912]  Exactly.
[01:56:18.912 --> 01:56:21.853]  They're physically trying to make it dark.
[01:56:21.853 --> 01:56:22.293]  Yep.
[01:56:22.293 --> 01:56:34.740]  And load us up with more metals so that these 5G towers that are popping up all over the Bay Area can somehow influence us more and keep us cordoned off and spiritually dead.
[01:56:35.779 --> 01:56:37.259]  This is why I pray.
[01:56:37.259 --> 01:56:51.302]  I pray daily, almost non-stop, and I encourage everyone listening to reach out with your heart to the soul of this universe that those in power can make a new choice.
[01:56:51.302 --> 01:56:56.804]  That they can choose to be free and free the rest of us.
[01:56:56.804 --> 01:56:58.264]  Alex, I just want to thank you for having
[01:56:59.093 --> 01:56:59.874]  I think so.
[01:57:18.189 --> 01:57:26.976]  Some serious medicine and it is incredibly inexpensive and I don't get how you can sell it for what you're selling it for, but there's some secret stuff in there that everyone needs to wake up to.
[01:57:26.976 --> 01:57:38.144]  And if you're coupling that with O3 therapy, which is ozone therapy, and you haven't touched on it too much, Alex, but... No, I saw the studies they did in Brazil and Spain and Germany on that.
[01:57:38.144 --> 01:57:39.465]  I mean, that just knocks it out.
[01:57:39.465 --> 01:57:41.547]  But again, they don't want somebody cured.
[01:57:41.547 --> 01:57:43.988]  They want people sick forever.
[01:57:43.988 --> 01:57:44.469]  Yeah.
[01:57:44.469 --> 01:57:44.629]  Yep.
[01:57:45.959 --> 01:57:50.882]  Well, let me ask you this, though, if we got a break here, you're making great points.
[01:57:50.882 --> 01:57:57.105]  This all looks scary, and I'm really upset about it, and I get mad too, but I see this as badly coordinated and falling apart.
[01:57:57.105 --> 01:58:10.353]  They got a bunch of sheep following what they're doing, but the awakening's pretty big, so I want people to not be too down as well, because I get down myself, but I got to realize there's a lot of innings left in this baseball game.
[01:58:10.353 --> 01:58:11.914]  They went too soon, Alex.
[01:58:11.914 --> 01:58:15.616]  Everyone I talk to is awake, and this wasn't so two years ago.
[01:58:16.673 --> 01:58:23.758]  Two years ago, most people didn't care, and rarely did I ever see anything MAGA.
[01:58:23.758 --> 01:58:25.979]  I try to wake people up wherever I go.
[01:58:25.979 --> 01:58:29.261]  My BMW has an Alex Jones bumper sticker.
[01:58:29.261 --> 01:58:31.382]  Nobody else is wearing anything similar.
[01:58:31.382 --> 01:58:34.444]  I wake up wherever I can possibly plant those seeds.
[01:58:34.444 --> 01:58:41.789]  But right now, what these guys have done is hilarious, because now... Hold on, hold on.
[01:58:41.789 --> 01:58:43.990]  Finish that point that Max Keiser is coming up with.
[01:58:43.990 --> 01:58:44.491]  Back in 60 seconds.
[01:58:48.251 --> 01:58:49.852]  Memorial Day is here.
[01:58:49.852 --> 01:58:52.033]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year.
[01:58:52.033 --> 01:58:56.816]  And we were already running a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.
[01:58:56.816 --> 01:59:05.422]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale, and then five items that weren't on sale that we got back in stock, they're also massively discounted as well.
[01:59:05.762 --> 01:59:06.142]  We're good to go!
[01:59:26.755 --> 01:59:35.345]  So, infowarestore.com or 888-253-3139 to get these items and take advantage of this Mega Sale Memorial Day.
[01:59:35.345 --> 01:59:36.987]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[01:59:36.987 --> 01:59:43.836]  We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supporting you and your family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[01:59:43.836 --> 01:59:45.358]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[01:59:45.358 --> 01:59:46.259]  We are all in this together.
[01:59:58.843 --> 02:00:05.089]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.943 --> 02:00:32.486]  All right, Max Keiser is about to have some huge breaking news as we get him on Skype from his undisclosed location.
[02:00:32.486 --> 02:00:39.250]  When I was finishing up with Derek, a biomedical worker at a hospital on COVID-19 saying it's a giant hoax, we've not screened your calls.
[02:00:39.250 --> 02:00:41.911]  That's what every medical worker that calls in for months says.
[02:00:41.911 --> 02:00:46.674]  Empty hospitals, they're ordered to put people that have other diseases as COVID-19.
[02:00:46.674 --> 02:00:49.576]  New York Times puts up names, people that died of gunshot wounds of COVID-19.
[02:00:51.021 --> 02:00:51.241]  Don't
[02:01:07.762 --> 02:01:08.542]  Just tell the story true.
[02:01:08.542 --> 02:01:14.425]  I was in a liquor store with my wife about two weeks ago, getting some beer and wine for a party some friends were going to have.
[02:01:14.425 --> 02:01:17.546]  And I'm in there and there's like 40 people in there.
[02:01:17.546 --> 02:01:18.867]  And they just mobbed me.
[02:01:18.867 --> 02:01:20.668]  They're all like, I used to think you were full of it.
[02:01:20.668 --> 02:01:21.228]  I'm a liberal.
[02:01:21.228 --> 02:01:21.608]  You're right.
[02:01:21.608 --> 02:01:22.308]  It's all a scam.
[02:01:22.308 --> 02:01:24.189]  It's all a fraud.
[02:01:24.189 --> 02:01:26.170]  That's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:01:26.170 --> 02:01:28.031]  There's a huge awakening.
[02:01:28.031 --> 02:01:29.271]  People really get now.
[02:01:29.271 --> 02:01:30.192]  This is a clampdown.
[02:01:30.192 --> 02:01:30.812]  This is a fraud.
[02:01:30.812 --> 02:01:31.372]  This is a hoax.
[02:01:31.372 --> 02:01:34.374]  So briefly, Derek, finish your point.
[02:01:34.374 --> 02:01:37.115]  You're seeing that you've seen just an explosion of awakening.
[02:01:38.055 --> 02:01:39.156]  Explosion.
[02:01:39.156 --> 02:01:42.540]  There's not a single person I talked to that doesn't say this isn't fake now.
[02:01:42.540 --> 02:01:43.380]  They're done.
[02:01:43.380 --> 02:01:45.523]  These people here in California, we're done.
[02:01:45.523 --> 02:01:51.368]  The Bay Area, you want to talk about, I think the group that's the most affected are the Hispanics.
[02:01:51.368 --> 02:01:54.732]  They're such a hard-working group of people and they're all out of work.
[02:01:54.732 --> 02:01:59.136]  80% or more here, I think it's 85% in California, they're out of work.
[02:01:59.136 --> 02:02:01.719]  The Hispanic community, they're sitting here
[02:02:02.922 --> 02:02:13.665]  They're living on their retirement and savings, and they seized right through it, and this is probably the... Oh, it's total siege to make us dependent, is it?
[02:02:13.665 --> 02:02:22.128]  The thing is, if they don't finish this off with some sort of coup de grace coming from the uppers, they're going to lose.
[02:02:22.128 --> 02:02:23.268]  It's done.
[02:02:23.268 --> 02:02:26.950]  Because everyone is so awake now, and you can't fool people twice.
[02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:28.230]  They're not going to be able to do this again.
[02:02:29.176 --> 02:02:30.957]  And Newsom's gotta go.
[02:02:30.957 --> 02:02:32.699]  And I'm not the only one to think that.
[02:02:32.699 --> 02:02:38.343]  Gavin Newsom, American psycho, that guy is drunk on power.
[02:02:38.343 --> 02:02:43.347]  And everyone around him and that Pelosi crime gang, we need to kick them out.
[02:02:43.347 --> 02:02:49.751]  I think everyone knows what's going on right now enough to when the next voting round comes, this is why they're gonna have to do paper ballot votes.
[02:02:49.751 --> 02:02:50.932]  And they see it coming.
[02:02:50.932 --> 02:02:53.194]  They know that they're not popular.
[02:02:53.194 --> 02:02:55.796]  For goodness sake, the sun healed.
[02:02:55.796 --> 02:02:57.357]  And we can't go to the beaches?
[02:02:59.242 --> 02:03:04.468]  There's patrols that go up and down the beaches that make people who are laying out on the sand get up.
[02:03:04.468 --> 02:03:05.910]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[02:03:05.910 --> 02:03:06.490]  All right, brother.
[02:03:06.490 --> 02:03:07.351]  Thank you so much, Derek.
[02:03:07.351 --> 02:03:13.298]  All right, joining us now is Max Kaiser, famous stockbroker, TV host with
[02:03:15.017 --> 02:03:21.279]  You name it, he's done it with the BBC and RT and Al Jazeera and everything in between.
[02:03:21.279 --> 02:03:27.381]  And he's here with MaxKaiser.com and he did say months ago that Bitcoin would be way up and it has gone up.
[02:03:27.381 --> 02:03:31.402]  I'm not a Bitcoin investor, so there's sides that are like anti-Bitcoin, pro-Bitcoin.
[02:03:31.402 --> 02:03:34.803]  I just have guests on to talk about topics, so everybody trying to put me in a camp.
[02:03:34.803 --> 02:03:35.903]  That's not what's going on here.
[02:03:35.903 --> 02:03:39.424]  We're going to get into Bitcoin some of the bottom of the hour with him, but he's got a lot of
[02:03:39.924 --> 02:03:41.485]  Things you get into here.
[02:03:41.485 --> 02:03:44.506]  What is happening in the economy, stock market, which is way up today.
[02:03:44.506 --> 02:03:47.607]  We can put up the Dow Jones Industrial Average, maybe, here.
[02:03:47.607 --> 02:03:51.869]  What is the Fed doing buying six trillion in junk assets and speculation?
[02:03:51.869 --> 02:03:53.629]  It goes to 100 trillion.
[02:03:53.629 --> 02:03:56.590]  What is the update on the casino good log?
[02:03:56.590 --> 02:03:59.792]  Is America being taken private by private equity?
[02:03:59.792 --> 02:04:04.813]  And we're going to talk about the cantalena there, if I'm pronouncing that right.
[02:04:04.813 --> 02:04:05.874]  People getting rich off the
[02:04:08.015 --> 02:04:11.716]  Alex Jones, great to be on with you again, my friend, my good friend Alex Jones.
[02:04:11.716 --> 02:04:12.216]  What's happening?
[02:04:29.747 --> 02:04:32.428]  Well, I got Max Keiser on, who's a smart cookie.
[02:04:32.428 --> 02:04:33.469]  What's really going on?
[02:04:33.469 --> 02:04:34.109]  Is Trump good?
[02:04:34.109 --> 02:04:34.730]  Is Trump bad?
[02:04:34.730 --> 02:04:36.110]  What's happening with the economy?
[02:04:36.110 --> 02:04:39.452]  What's happening with the trillions they keep saying they're putting into the economy?
[02:04:39.452 --> 02:04:40.253]  The lockdown?
[02:04:40.253 --> 02:04:44.735]  This term?
[02:04:44.735 --> 02:04:45.015]  Right.
[02:04:45.015 --> 02:04:51.139]  Well, let's go back to kind of update the conversation that we've been having.
[02:04:51.139 --> 02:04:53.660]  I think we've been having this now for seven or eight years.
[02:04:54.403 --> 02:05:01.448]  And it has to do with the American economy, the global economy, and it has to do with money itself.
[02:05:01.448 --> 02:05:06.131]  So what we have experiencing right now in the U.S.
[02:05:06.131 --> 02:05:10.614]  is that there's a huge boom in the stock market.
[02:05:10.614 --> 02:05:17.919]  And that boom is benefiting a very select few of billionaires or what we call cantillionaires.
[02:05:17.919 --> 02:05:19.300]  And I'll explain what that means in a second.
[02:05:19.912 --> 02:05:25.213]  Meanwhile, as you read, the unemployment rates are skyrocketing and people are suffering.
[02:05:25.213 --> 02:05:29.794]  They're forced to shelter at home and deprived of basic sunlight.
[02:05:29.794 --> 02:05:38.996]  But somehow, the top 1% of the 1% is making out hundreds of millions, hundreds of billions of dollars are pouring into these pockets.
[02:05:38.996 --> 02:05:43.037]  So the establishment is waging war on us and vertically integrating everything right now.
[02:05:44.721 --> 02:05:50.145]  Yeah, basically, you know, let's get back to a basic point about fiat money.
[02:05:50.145 --> 02:05:57.671]  It's the economy can be described as the creation of debt money and all fiat money is debt money.
[02:05:57.671 --> 02:06:11.022]  When the creation of debt money is slower than the rate at which it's collapsing, the bond markets collapsing or the economy is collapsing, then you have economic pullback and you have a stock market pullback.
[02:06:11.022 --> 02:06:14.164]  When the debt money is being created at a faster rate,
[02:06:14.947 --> 02:06:19.709]  And its underlying economy is deteriorating.
[02:06:19.709 --> 02:06:21.990]  Then you have the stock market rally.
[02:06:21.990 --> 02:06:24.051]  But at the end of the day, it's still debt money.
[02:06:24.051 --> 02:06:34.355]  All debt money for the past 300 years, all fiat debt money, has gone to zero, including the British pound, which has lost 98% of its purchasing power over the past 300 years.
[02:06:34.355 --> 02:06:40.678]  So now, knowing that its demise was here, it's waging war against the real economy, making us think that we need it.
[02:06:40.678 --> 02:06:43.659]  So this is really about making us take on more of their loans.
[02:06:45.253 --> 02:06:50.416]  Well, anytime a dollar is introduced into the economy, the debt is increased.
[02:06:50.416 --> 02:06:56.300]  And the Cantillon effect is how this wealth transfer takes place.
[02:06:56.300 --> 02:07:03.164]  So the way that the fiat money is distributed, the debt money is distributed, is distributed through the banks, through the Wall Street banks.
[02:07:03.164 --> 02:07:05.085]  That's where it goes first.
[02:07:05.085 --> 02:07:12.490]  And the bankers and their friends, they use their fiat gift from the central bank to buy back their own stock.
[02:07:12.490 --> 02:07:14.331]  So their own stocks go up in value.
[02:07:15.143 --> 02:07:19.046]  And it could be Apple, it could be Microsoft, it could be any of the large corporations.
[02:07:19.046 --> 02:07:22.989]  They buy back their own stock with the free money they get from the central bank.
[02:07:22.989 --> 02:07:29.794]  And of course, all the executives have stock options tied to the current stock price, but they only pay $1 for an option.
[02:07:29.794 --> 02:07:33.136]  So if the stock goes up $20, that $1 option is not worth $20.
[02:07:33.136 --> 02:07:35.798]  They made 20X.
[02:07:35.798 --> 02:07:37.840]  And so this is how the game is played.
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:39.902]  So why couldn't Obama do it at the level Trump is?
[02:07:39.902 --> 02:07:44.345]  Why does the establishment so mad at Trump, but then he's doing exactly what you think they want?
[02:07:45.953 --> 02:07:53.560]  Well, during Obama's administration, he had to repeal a lot of things in the law to make this easier.
[02:07:53.560 --> 02:07:55.322]  He had to get rid of Glass-Steagall.
[02:07:55.322 --> 02:07:59.086]  That happened during Clinton, which is a part of the Democratic establishment.
[02:07:59.086 --> 02:08:01.128]  Also, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act.
[02:08:01.727 --> 02:08:03.689]  Well, legalize financial gambling.
[02:08:03.689 --> 02:08:05.590]  That had to be introduced.
[02:08:05.590 --> 02:08:18.300]  He had to do a lot of work getting rid of some of the regulations that Obama was instrumental in getting rid of to clear the playing field so that these bankers now have a lawless environment, a ruleless environment.
[02:08:18.300 --> 02:08:19.061]  There's no law.
[02:08:20.114 --> 02:08:23.216]  There are laws in place, Alex, but none of them are being enforced, right?
[02:08:23.216 --> 02:08:30.220]  So like Jamie Dimon at JPMorgan, he's now worth a couple of billion dollars, and he got there by breaking the law.
[02:08:30.220 --> 02:08:41.287]  And we know that because he's had to face criminal charges many times that were paid off with a fine, or a civil charge that was paid off with a fine.
[02:08:42.546 --> 02:08:47.330]  So his business model is to keep 90 cents of every dollar he steals.
[02:08:47.330 --> 02:08:49.231]  And that's the business model of America.
[02:08:49.231 --> 02:08:54.215]  Most businesses in America follow this money laundering kind of fake economy.
[02:08:54.215 --> 02:09:00.640]  Even the Bank of America recently said that they accused the Federal Reserve Bank of engaging in fake markets.
[02:09:00.640 --> 02:09:03.682]  Another fake market that's similar is the fracking market.
[02:09:03.682 --> 02:09:07.205]  They lose incredible amount of money on every dollar they spend.
[02:09:07.766 --> 02:09:09.712]  The fracking industry has never been profitable.
[02:09:09.712 --> 02:09:11.137]  It's never been cash flow positive.
[02:09:11.137 --> 02:09:13.405]  Sure, everybody knows wall catting is a speculative deal.
[02:09:14.465 --> 02:09:17.946]  But fracking is uniquely money-losing.
[02:09:17.946 --> 02:09:24.207]  In wildcatting, you might hit a whale one out of 50, or one out of 20, and it pays for itself.
[02:09:24.207 --> 02:09:25.747]  Okay, that's different than fracking.
[02:09:25.747 --> 02:09:30.788]  Fracking, we know that the amount of capital that goes in... No, I was just using that as another example.
[02:09:30.788 --> 02:09:31.548]  So stay there.
[02:09:31.548 --> 02:09:34.368]  Let's come back and talk about where it's going next.
[02:09:34.368 --> 02:09:36.449]  This is all really important, folks.
[02:09:36.449 --> 02:09:38.989]  Now they want to kill the real economy to feed it to Wall Street.
[02:09:38.989 --> 02:09:42.890]  Even though it all starves to death, they'll still be quintillionaires.
[02:09:42.890 --> 02:09:43.390]  We'll be right back.
[02:09:43.390 --> 02:09:43.730]  Stay with us.
[02:09:46.095 --> 02:10:00.824]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an elk at say 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run 50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards.
[02:10:00.824 --> 02:10:05.347]  They've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins.
[02:10:05.347 --> 02:10:11.330]  But all of a sudden they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over and they die.
[02:10:11.330 --> 02:10:13.552]  Then you go back them and haul them back in.
[02:10:14.412 --> 02:10:17.916]  Well, that's what's going to happen to the entire world now.
[02:10:17.916 --> 02:10:23.782]  And that's what the economic numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the heart.
[02:10:23.782 --> 02:10:28.887]  And for the first world, it's going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[02:10:28.887 --> 02:10:33.091]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead, according to the UN, and I believe their numbers.
[02:10:33.712 --> 02:10:38.457]  Because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world.
[02:10:38.457 --> 02:10:44.763]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're a bunch of suckers and you've bought into something bigger than what Hitler did.
[02:10:45.734 --> 02:10:50.736]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[02:10:50.736 --> 02:10:58.640]  Sure, coffee, candy, and other highly sugar-filled drinks can give you a short boost, but the crash always follows.
[02:10:58.640 --> 02:11:04.943]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go when you need a little help.
[02:11:04.943 --> 02:11:05.784]  TurboForce.
[02:11:06.224 --> 02:11:22.536]  Similar to other mix-in energy packets, TurboForce from InfoWars Live utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years across the world to provide focus, clarity, and a boost of energy when you need it.
[02:11:22.896 --> 02:11:29.999]  TurboForce is certainly a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable, and tasty energy.
[02:11:29.999 --> 02:11:37.462]  And speaking of affordable, you can even try TurboForce for a limited time at an incredible 40% off.
[02:11:37.462 --> 02:11:49.087]  Don't wait till it's out of stock again and get TurboForce right now only at Infowarestore.com.
[02:11:49.087 --> 02:11:51.708]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:08.909 --> 02:12:10.653]  Cantillionaires!
[02:12:10.653 --> 02:12:13.138]  Max Keiser is here to define it for us.
[02:12:13.138 --> 02:12:19.191]  He's got swanbitcoin.com forward slash keiser is the main site he wants you to visit.
[02:12:19.191 --> 02:12:19.812]  Okay, so Max.
[02:12:21.291 --> 02:12:23.413]  Look, I want to be a fan of Trump.
[02:12:23.413 --> 02:12:26.895]  And the fact is, I've been persecuted really bad for being a Trump supporter.
[02:12:26.895 --> 02:12:28.336]  So I'm kind of pig-headed.
[02:12:28.336 --> 02:12:31.579]  It makes me want to support him more.
[02:12:31.579 --> 02:12:35.402]  Quite frankly, if I hadn't been persecuted so much, I probably wouldn't support Trump as much.
[02:12:35.402 --> 02:12:38.444]  I try to be aware of my own sick psychology.
[02:12:38.444 --> 02:12:40.525]  Obviously, I like him better than Hillary.
[02:12:40.525 --> 02:12:42.527]  Obviously, I'm trying to be disruptive to the globalists.
[02:12:42.527 --> 02:12:45.369]  But Trump keeps trying to give Wall Street what they want.
[02:12:45.369 --> 02:12:48.511]  They don't appreciate that because they want the money and they want the power.
[02:12:49.412 --> 02:12:50.993]  But don't just go along with my view.
[02:12:50.993 --> 02:12:51.994]  What is your real view?
[02:12:51.994 --> 02:12:54.836]  Let's take the gloves off and we'll get into all the issues with you.
[02:12:54.836 --> 02:12:56.977]  You were trying to get to it as we came to break.
[02:12:56.977 --> 02:13:01.480]  What the hell's going on with Trump allowing the censorship now of the word pandemic?
[02:13:01.480 --> 02:13:06.724]  If you're not an approved site, you can't even type that into Twitter or YouTube.
[02:13:06.724 --> 02:13:10.686]  Now YouTube is blocking what the Communist Party says to block.
[02:13:10.686 --> 02:13:11.787]  That's big news today.
[02:13:11.787 --> 02:13:16.010]  I mean, it's like it isn't just Alex Jones being censored now.
[02:13:16.010 --> 02:13:19.012]  It's everyone in live time surveillance.
[02:13:19.712 --> 02:13:22.495]  Totally draconian, social credit scores.
[02:13:22.495 --> 02:13:27.478]  They're using the COVID-19 for the world digital currency.
[02:13:27.478 --> 02:13:29.780]  Bill Gates has his own crypto.
[02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:32.923]  What in Hades is the big picture?
[02:13:32.923 --> 02:13:33.163]  Right.
[02:13:33.163 --> 02:13:37.927]  Well, Trump only really looks at one metric and that's the stock market.
[02:13:37.927 --> 02:13:43.911]  That's what he gauges his self, his approval and his own self-worth on the stock market.
[02:13:43.911 --> 02:13:45.252]  You know, he's a guy from New York.
[02:13:45.252 --> 02:13:48.675]  He grew up, he came of age during the 1980s when the stock market boomed.
[02:13:49.429 --> 02:13:57.334]  And the world's kind of focused on stock markets as we had a transition from an industrial and agricultural economy to a financialized economy.
[02:13:57.334 --> 02:14:01.096]  The stock market becomes the center of everyone's financial consciousness.
[02:14:01.096 --> 02:14:09.361]  And that Dow Jones Index average is tells you minute by minute how you do in life and what you're worth.
[02:14:09.361 --> 02:14:16.165]  And so when he does everything he can to pump stocks, he's a stock pumper and he's done a great job in pumping stock.
[02:14:16.165 --> 02:14:17.726]  Unfortunately, that means he's
[02:14:18.146 --> 02:14:25.132]  Pull the Federal Reserve Bank to go into their money printing scheme to print a lot of money.
[02:14:25.132 --> 02:14:27.514]  Money printer go brr over there.
[02:14:27.514 --> 02:14:33.059]  I'm all for laissez-faire and big markets and I get they build things and enthusiasm bills, but like you were saying.
[02:14:34.946 --> 02:14:37.327]  No, it's not.
[02:14:37.327 --> 02:14:39.608]  It's Bernie Madoff on PCP, though.
[02:14:39.608 --> 02:14:43.389]  When it's all a fraud and we just give it all the power, it's going to destroy us.
[02:14:43.389 --> 02:14:43.889]  Sorry, go ahead.
[02:14:43.889 --> 02:14:45.990]  Right, it's not building anything.
[02:14:45.990 --> 02:14:47.630]  It's not laissez-faire capitalism.
[02:14:47.630 --> 02:14:58.854]  It's the furthest thing from laissez-faire free market capitalism because all this free money printing that's awarded to the insiders who use it to buy back their own stock and run away with billions.
[02:14:58.854 --> 02:14:59.775]  It's not crony capitalism.
[02:14:59.775 --> 02:15:00.275]  It's rigged.
[02:15:01.147 --> 02:15:01.487]  Right.
[02:15:01.487 --> 02:15:03.488]  And what that does is has two effects.
[02:15:03.488 --> 02:15:14.973]  Not only does it award the least talented amongst us, but entrepreneurs get crowded out because they don't have access to that capital because all that capital is going to the crony capitalists, the kleptocracy.
[02:15:14.973 --> 02:15:18.395]  So the base of new enterprises and all the
[02:15:18.905 --> 02:15:23.609]  Thousands of small to medium-sized enterprises in America are starving for capital right now.
[02:15:23.609 --> 02:15:25.130]  And that means that's the seed stock.
[02:15:25.130 --> 02:15:27.091]  That's America in 20 years, 30 years, 40 years.
[02:15:27.091 --> 02:15:28.673]  And that's your next point.
[02:15:28.673 --> 02:15:33.016]  This ultra-rich that hoard the money and put it back into the fraud.
[02:15:33.016 --> 02:15:33.276]  Right.
[02:15:33.276 --> 02:15:36.258]  And you can see it clearly in what's called the money velocity chart.
[02:15:36.258 --> 02:15:40.622]  If you do a quick search, you know, your staff over there for money velocity, it'll pop up.
[02:15:41.445 --> 02:15:41.885]  That's great.
[02:16:00.703 --> 02:16:04.286]  The insiders, the cantillionaires, as I call them, are hoarding the cash.
[02:16:04.286 --> 02:16:07.428]  They're not loaning it out to small and medium-sized enterprises.
[02:16:07.428 --> 02:16:09.330]  And they're just buying their own stock back.
[02:16:09.330 --> 02:16:15.994]  I was about to say, I looked at the Bill & Melinda Gates report that came out last week on their tax-free foundation and what it bought.
[02:16:15.994 --> 02:16:21.739]  And it's no more farming or ranching or industry or service.
[02:16:21.739 --> 02:16:23.540]  It's all big tech.
[02:16:23.540 --> 02:16:24.381]  That's it.
[02:16:24.381 --> 02:16:24.981]  And medical.
[02:16:24.981 --> 02:16:29.344]  So they are completely exiting a real economy and doubling down on the fraudulent one.
[02:16:29.344 --> 02:16:30.005]  Exactly what you're saying.
[02:16:31.195 --> 02:16:31.595]  Right.
[02:16:31.595 --> 02:16:36.679]  You're creating what I call the casino gulag, which is a term I coined on your show a few years ago.
[02:16:36.679 --> 02:16:38.681]  And the casino gulag is thriving right now.
[02:16:38.681 --> 02:16:42.624]  People are sheltering at home and they're forced to go online.
[02:16:42.624 --> 02:16:50.590]  And the model here is if you click on an ad, you might get a protein pill or you're going to starve to death and you won't be able to go outside.
[02:16:50.590 --> 02:16:54.533]  And remember that for every dollar you click an ad on a site like Facebook,
[02:16:55.165 --> 02:17:02.369]  Facebook Corporation can use that recurring revenue stream to borrow $100,000 from the central bank.
[02:17:02.369 --> 02:17:08.072]  So that's how the leverage works against everybody who's not an insider at these major tech companies.
[02:17:08.072 --> 02:17:18.058]  It's all based on buying back your own stock, getting free money from the Fed, and imposing this casino gulag model, and not making capital available to small to medium enterprises.
[02:17:18.058 --> 02:17:22.660]  And you end up with a neo-feudalism.
[02:17:22.660 --> 02:17:24.181]  So now he's got wealth
[02:17:24.517 --> 02:17:24.797]  Thank you.
[02:17:45.509 --> 02:17:48.011]  Analysis.
[02:17:48.011 --> 02:17:51.153]  I started out by saying, you know, let's review the history of money.
[02:17:51.153 --> 02:17:52.815]  All fiat money is debt money.
[02:17:52.815 --> 02:17:55.437]  None has survived in the past 300 years.
[02:17:55.437 --> 02:17:56.497]  OK, so what is money?
[02:17:56.497 --> 02:17:58.699]  There's only two forms of money right now that are worth anything.
[02:17:58.699 --> 02:17:59.380]  Gold.
[02:17:59.380 --> 02:18:00.701]  And we know why gold's worth something.
[02:18:00.701 --> 02:18:02.462]  It's been worth something for thousands of years.
[02:18:03.132 --> 02:18:03.953]  And Bitcoin, right?
[02:18:03.953 --> 02:18:05.534]  Bitcoin is the new gold.
[02:18:05.534 --> 02:18:07.696]  It's gold 2.0.
[02:18:07.696 --> 02:18:11.319]  The way it came about was something of an industrial accident.
[02:18:11.319 --> 02:18:17.465]  You know, programmers are trying to figure out how to create digital files that you couldn't copy.
[02:18:17.465 --> 02:18:22.409]  And what they accidentally stumbled into was the hardest money ever in the history of humankind.
[02:18:22.409 --> 02:18:27.253]  And now it's become this Godzilla currency monster that's competing with gold.
[02:18:27.253 --> 02:18:28.955]  Isn't that the essence of value?
[02:18:28.955 --> 02:18:30.116]  Something you can't copy.
[02:18:30.116 --> 02:18:31.017]  That means the genuine.
[02:18:32.082 --> 02:18:33.123]  Exactly.
[02:18:33.123 --> 02:18:33.783]  That's right.
[02:18:33.783 --> 02:18:37.765]  You don't want to easily counterfeit your money, right?
[02:18:37.765 --> 02:18:45.148]  Like the Fed, they just print... Donald Trump calls up Jay Powell and says, I'm really unhappy with the stock market being down 2% today.
[02:18:45.148 --> 02:18:49.590]  Can you please print another $4 trillion of phony fiat U.S.
[02:18:49.590 --> 02:18:50.671]  dollar money, please?
[02:18:50.671 --> 02:18:55.373]  And so the corporations can buy back their own stock with free money and make the stock market go up, please?
[02:18:55.373 --> 02:18:56.873]  Because that's the only thing I look at.
[02:18:56.873 --> 02:18:58.014]  That's the only thing I look at.
[02:18:58.496 --> 02:19:00.278]  But Alex, here's the deal.
[02:19:00.278 --> 02:19:02.320]  We've talked about Bitcoin for a few years.
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:12.449]  And so today I am basically I'm going to throw down the gauntlet and I'm going to change your viewers lives right now.
[02:19:12.449 --> 02:19:16.933]  I'm going to give every one of your viewers $10 of free Bitcoin right now.
[02:19:16.933 --> 02:19:23.279]  If they go to swanbitcoin.com forward slash Alex, the promo code Alex, they'll get
[02:19:24.249 --> 02:19:26.451]  $10 free Bitcoin right now.
[02:19:26.451 --> 02:19:27.452]  Right now.
[02:19:27.452 --> 02:19:29.853]  That's your on-ramp to Bitcoin.
[02:19:29.853 --> 02:19:32.555]  I'll be accused in some SEC thing.
[02:19:32.555 --> 02:19:34.136]  This is the first I'm learning of this.
[02:19:34.136 --> 02:19:36.718]  That's right.
[02:19:36.718 --> 02:19:38.980]  I'm not playing anymore.
[02:19:38.980 --> 02:19:51.429]  We're going to finally make a solution available to your listeners that are now going to experience the hardest money ever in the history of humankind and escape the fiat money prison.
[02:19:52.029 --> 02:19:58.254]  All right, swanbitcoin.com forward slash, or you can use forward slash Kaiser, use my name, or forward slash Alec.
[02:19:58.254 --> 02:19:59.294]  It'll get you to the same place.
[02:19:59.294 --> 02:20:02.296]  You get $10 free Bitcoin.
[02:20:02.296 --> 02:20:05.178]  That's the best deal any of your listeners are going to hear.
[02:20:05.178 --> 02:20:15.686]  Listen, when I said I like currencies outside the system, just not even for their speculative value, but so you could actually get across the border with money that's yours and to take care of your family.
[02:20:15.686 --> 02:20:21.290]  So when I told you I like, I get the concept of Bitcoin, I don't like the speculation, the wars, but this is what I'm talking about.
[02:20:21.730 --> 02:20:22.490]  You're on the show.
[02:20:22.490 --> 02:20:25.712]  I knew you'd probably plug Bitcoin, but now... What speculation?
[02:20:25.712 --> 02:20:26.933]  Promo code Alex here.
[02:20:26.933 --> 02:20:32.056]  They're gonna have the damn FBI coming out of black helicopters in probably six hours over this.
[02:20:32.056 --> 02:20:34.697]  I don't even know... I thought you were ready to fight the war.
[02:20:34.697 --> 02:20:35.518]  You don't understand, Max.
[02:20:35.518 --> 02:20:36.378]  You don't understand.
[02:20:36.378 --> 02:20:38.479]  I thought you were ready to go to battle.
[02:20:38.479 --> 02:20:42.181]  I thought you were ready to go into the ring.
[02:20:42.181 --> 02:20:42.561]  Okay.
[02:20:42.561 --> 02:20:45.023]  To see how money... If I'm going to prison, where's my paycheck?
[02:20:55.323 --> 02:21:11.246]  All right, Max Keiser is a really interesting fella, and I've been having him on the air for, I don't know, probably 15 years.
[02:21:11.246 --> 02:21:14.207]  And he's here with us, and I knew he'd come on today and talk about Bitcoin.
[02:21:15.396 --> 02:21:20.661]  And you've had like Schiff over there, when I had him on a few months ago, like, oh, Jones endorses Bitcoin.
[02:21:20.661 --> 02:21:23.143]  He sold out after years of not selling out.
[02:21:23.143 --> 02:21:25.345]  I haven't gotten a dollar from Bitcoin.
[02:21:25.345 --> 02:21:26.526]  I'm not in the stock market.
[02:21:26.526 --> 02:21:28.107]  I'm not in Bitcoin.
[02:21:28.107 --> 02:21:36.454]  I ran into Max Keiser in Austin, Texas, and I said, yeah, let's put up the graph from the Wall Street Journal of where it was a few years ago at that big high.
[02:21:36.454 --> 02:21:37.515]  And they said it was dead.
[02:21:37.515 --> 02:21:40.438]  And now it's gotten close to half its gains back.
[02:21:41.682 --> 02:21:45.703]  I'm all about new currencies and things that are outside the system.
[02:21:45.703 --> 02:21:58.766]  But Max, again, I don't think on your RT show you sit there and go, oh my gosh, here's your free $10 worth of Bitcoin for people with the name Alex.
[02:21:58.766 --> 02:22:05.907]  When they go to that, is that for Alex Jones Show or is that for Alexander the Great, Alexander Graham Bell, Alexander de Tocqueville?
[02:22:05.907 --> 02:22:08.528]  Who is this Alexander that's endorsing this?
[02:22:09.674 --> 02:22:10.574]  Exactly.
[02:22:10.574 --> 02:22:13.215]  It's just a generic Alex.
[02:22:13.215 --> 02:22:13.915]  It's generic.
[02:22:13.915 --> 02:22:16.716]  It doesn't refer to any individual living or dead.
[02:22:16.716 --> 02:22:18.536]  Well, no, I'll be... Here's the thing.
[02:22:18.536 --> 02:22:25.438]  I'll be accused of some conspiracy with you, and then I'm trying to pump Bitcoin up here.
[02:22:25.438 --> 02:22:26.878]  I don't even know anything about this.
[02:22:26.878 --> 02:22:27.519]  You can't.
[02:22:27.519 --> 02:22:33.020]  It's too... It's already beyond the ability of any one individual to affect the price, you know?
[02:22:33.020 --> 02:22:36.401]  It's become sewn into the fabric of the global economy.
[02:22:37.021 --> 02:22:45.709]  And those who don't want to get involved are going to find that all of their fiat money... No, I'm learning that whether you want to be involved or not, you are.
[02:22:45.709 --> 02:22:50.693]  Okay, well how much Bitcoin do I get today on the show from Max Keiser?
[02:22:50.693 --> 02:22:54.797]  One thing I've learned with these Bitcoin people is they got tighter asses than I do.
[02:22:54.797 --> 02:22:57.479]  I can guarantee I can give you $10 worth of Bitcoin.
[02:22:57.759 --> 02:22:58.940]  By clicking on Kaiser.
[02:22:58.940 --> 02:23:05.906]  You go to swanbitcoin.com forward slash Kaiser, register to the site and I'll give you, you get 10 bucks for free Bitcoin right now.
[02:23:05.906 --> 02:23:06.706]  Let's just say that.
[02:23:06.706 --> 02:23:07.827]  Okay, forget about it.
[02:23:07.827 --> 02:23:12.551]  This is Max Keiser trolling Alex Jones, which is an entertaining, entertaining thing.
[02:23:12.551 --> 02:23:13.112]  You know, I,
[02:23:13.772 --> 02:23:22.677]  I'm just up here trying to promote American freedom and trying to expose, because I agree with you on your market analysis and what's going to happen to the economy, but we get into the whole Bitcoin spiel.
[02:23:22.677 --> 02:23:25.598]  The root cause of the problem is the money, Alex.
[02:23:25.598 --> 02:23:28.360]  That's what I've been saying for 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years.
[02:23:28.360 --> 02:23:31.061]  The root cause is this fiat money.
[02:23:31.061 --> 02:23:35.864]  And unless you have a solution for that, you're going to be always on the losing end.
[02:23:35.864 --> 02:23:42.788]  And because you are righteous and you are holy and Bitcoin is holy that I've learned about this major promotion for the first time here live on air.
[02:23:43.348 --> 02:23:46.871]  I just looked at the track record and I just looked at what's been going on.
[02:23:46.871 --> 02:23:49.633]  I've been right for, you know, ten years.
[02:23:49.633 --> 02:23:52.736]  Nine years I've been talking about it and I haven't been wrong yet.
[02:23:52.736 --> 02:23:57.300]  That's a tremendous track record.
[02:23:57.300 --> 02:23:59.822]  Peter Schiff's been wrong for nine years.
[02:23:59.822 --> 02:24:01.803]  He's been wrong for nine years.
[02:24:01.803 --> 02:24:02.924]  He should not say anything.
[02:24:02.924 --> 02:24:06.247]  I haven't gotten my check from him promoting his Chinese stocks yet either.
[02:24:07.984 --> 02:24:23.072]  Well, you know, he's lax in his analysis and he's unable to provide any kind of worthwhile prediction or analysis.
[02:24:23.072 --> 02:24:26.413]  Yeah, but sometimes you have to look past the immediate gratification.
[02:24:26.413 --> 02:24:28.134]  Are you in the interest of the wider interest of your audience as a whole?
[02:24:34.238 --> 02:24:40.706]  Beyond any short-term immediate gratification, then you'd see that this is a solution to take everybody out of the malaise.
[02:24:40.706 --> 02:24:41.948]  Did you say short-term?
[02:24:41.948 --> 02:24:44.031]  Dude, I can't bet on something.
[02:24:44.960 --> 02:24:45.820]  Let me explain something.
[02:24:45.820 --> 02:24:46.640]  That's what I'm saying.
[02:24:46.640 --> 02:24:46.840]  Stop.
[02:24:46.840 --> 02:24:47.020]  Stop.
[02:24:47.020 --> 02:24:47.501]  Let me talk.
[02:24:47.501 --> 02:24:48.561]  It's not a bet.
[02:24:48.561 --> 02:24:49.141]  Don't filibuster.
[02:24:49.141 --> 02:24:50.501]  This is a lifestyle change.
[02:24:50.501 --> 02:25:03.004]  If I'm promoting vitamin B3 that is essential, I know it works, or vitamin C, or PQQ, or CoQ10, or iodine, that stuff I know I'm giving people a sure bet.
[02:25:03.004 --> 02:25:05.164]  I'm not saying people are bad to get Bitcoin.
[02:25:05.164 --> 02:25:07.224]  They just better not bet the mortgage on it.
[02:25:07.224 --> 02:25:09.745]  That's all I'm saying is, for me, it's a speculative thing.
[02:25:10.325 --> 02:25:14.090]  And so that's why I think it might be interesting for people to get a small piece of it just to see what happens with it.
[02:25:14.090 --> 02:25:15.492]  I just... Exactly!
[02:25:15.492 --> 02:25:16.433]  That's what I'm saying!
[02:25:16.433 --> 02:25:19.237]  I just learned about this on the date, dude.
[02:25:19.237 --> 02:25:25.245]  You like picked me up at my front door and all of a sudden you got me on the couch, my legs behind my ears, and you know, I didn't know this was about to happen.
[02:25:25.245 --> 02:25:26.046]  Max, you're raping me.
[02:25:28.214 --> 02:25:31.956]  Well, you can talk to me during the break.
[02:25:31.956 --> 02:25:33.357]  I'm here to chat with you.
[02:25:33.357 --> 02:25:34.118]  I identify as a woman.
[02:25:34.118 --> 02:25:39.561]  You were back there having some excellent Austin barbecue in the conference room and some of that mashed potatoes.
[02:25:39.561 --> 02:25:42.582]  I know it's irresistible, but you should talk to me during the break.
[02:25:42.582 --> 02:25:44.564]  You know, you leave me hanging out here.
[02:25:44.564 --> 02:25:48.606]  I'm trying to fix the problem by offering a solution out of fiat money.
[02:25:48.606 --> 02:25:50.627]  Bitcoin has proven itself over nine years.
[02:25:50.627 --> 02:25:51.868]  It's never gone down.
[02:25:51.868 --> 02:25:55.070]  For a major promotion, I have to agree with the position.
[02:25:55.530 --> 02:26:01.575]  I have to think it's moral, I have to think it's overall a good bet for my audience, I have to understand it, I have to tell them, and then I got to get paid.
[02:26:01.575 --> 02:26:06.679]  Because I got to fund this operation and feed all these little baby birds that are very hungry.
[02:26:06.679 --> 02:26:07.860]  The guy running the mill needs money.
[02:26:07.860 --> 02:26:09.181]  He's like a little baby bird.
[02:26:09.181 --> 02:26:10.102]  Well, let's talk!
[02:26:10.102 --> 02:26:10.923]  Let's talk, you know?
[02:26:10.923 --> 02:26:11.983]  Maybe I jumped the gun a bit.
[02:26:11.983 --> 02:26:15.146]  Oh, it's always, I'm going to get the money, I'm going to get the money.
[02:26:15.146 --> 02:26:17.488]  You know, it's important that we get this information out there.
[02:26:17.488 --> 02:26:19.349]  I think we would agree about that.
[02:26:19.349 --> 02:26:20.911]  All right, listen.
[02:26:21.877 --> 02:26:23.037]  Max, I love you to death.
[02:26:23.037 --> 02:26:24.438]  Let me be serious here with you.
[02:26:24.438 --> 02:26:26.318]  We're going to make it work.
[02:26:26.318 --> 02:26:28.619]  You're going to love this.
[02:26:28.619 --> 02:26:30.259]  This is the ultimate red pill.
[02:26:30.259 --> 02:26:32.260]  The ultimate red pill, Alex, is Bitcoin.
[02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:35.160]  The ultimate red pill.
[02:26:35.160 --> 02:26:39.441]  Or you're a doll that has a string that says Bitcoin, ultimate red pill, when you pull it.
[02:26:39.441 --> 02:26:41.762]  I'm asking you, Max, how high do you think Bitcoin will go?
[02:26:43.077 --> 02:26:46.701]  The track record, you know, you said the same thing when it was $1, Alex.
[02:26:46.701 --> 02:26:47.762]  Now it's at $8,000, $9,000, right?
[02:26:47.762 --> 02:26:51.005]  So you've been saying this for nine years.
[02:26:51.005 --> 02:26:58.292]  I'm saying let's get over this hesitancy and your shyness about starting and being a part of this revolution.
[02:26:58.292 --> 02:27:00.534]  Let's jump in, be a part of the revolution.
[02:27:00.534 --> 02:27:01.215]  Why are you so shy?
[02:27:01.795 --> 02:27:07.922]  Well, she has told me that I am literally your acolyte and your minion, so maybe I should join you.
[02:27:07.922 --> 02:27:10.444]  She's been wrong for seven or eight years.
[02:27:10.444 --> 02:27:13.808]  He hasn't had a right call since the 2008 housing crisis.
[02:27:13.808 --> 02:27:15.590]  He's been wrong now for 12 years.
[02:27:15.590 --> 02:27:17.552]  He hasn't said a single correct thing in 12 years.
[02:27:17.552 --> 02:27:18.253]  Well, he did.
[02:27:18.253 --> 02:27:19.294]  He said that I work for you.
[02:27:19.294 --> 02:27:20.135]  That's certainly not true.
[02:27:21.673 --> 02:27:23.535]  Everything he said about the markets is wrong.
[02:27:23.535 --> 02:27:27.198]  He was completely wrong about the dollar.
[02:27:27.198 --> 02:27:30.141]  He was completely wrong about those paychecks from you.
[02:27:30.141 --> 02:27:32.743]  About gold, right?
[02:27:32.743 --> 02:27:35.906]  No, Alex, I mean, let's chat.
[02:27:35.906 --> 02:27:36.967]  I mean, let's chat.
[02:27:36.967 --> 02:27:38.088]  I'm just joking around.
[02:27:38.088 --> 02:27:39.929]  Where is gold and silver going?
[02:27:39.929 --> 02:27:43.893]  Chat with me during the break, and by the time you come out of break, you're going to be singing a different song.
[02:27:44.674 --> 02:27:45.434]  I guarantee it.
[02:27:45.434 --> 02:27:47.395]  As long as people get the victory.
[02:27:47.395 --> 02:27:49.835]  This is the time to take it to the next level.
[02:27:49.835 --> 02:27:50.675]  I sell victory, Kaiser.
[02:27:50.675 --> 02:27:51.076]  I sell success.
[02:27:51.076 --> 02:27:52.856]  This is the time to go big.
[02:27:52.856 --> 02:27:55.957]  I cannot sell something unless I know it's a winner!
[02:27:55.957 --> 02:27:58.177]  All of your marketing is like, oh, the new robot.
[02:27:58.177 --> 02:28:02.118]  Hey, before I got married, I told the girl getting an enemy would be a good time.
[02:28:02.118 --> 02:28:04.459]  Stay in the solution and get out of the problem!
[02:28:04.459 --> 02:28:05.459]  Alright.
[02:28:06.075 --> 02:28:09.922]  What about the overall economy outside of the universe of Bitcoin?
[02:28:09.922 --> 02:28:13.908]  What are these globalist bankers, these centillionaires, what are they going to do?
[02:28:13.908 --> 02:28:16.973]  They're building bunkers.
[02:28:16.973 --> 02:28:18.276]  They know this is untenable.
[02:28:18.276 --> 02:28:19.538]  Why don't they try to stabilize things?
[02:28:20.529 --> 02:28:21.489]  Why are they doing this?
[02:28:21.489 --> 02:28:23.490]  Well, because it's working, right?
[02:28:23.490 --> 02:28:23.991]  It's working.
[02:28:23.991 --> 02:28:27.032]  This system is, it's working for them.
[02:28:27.032 --> 02:28:28.173]  Why would they stop?
[02:28:28.173 --> 02:28:32.495]  They were able, you know, in 1929, the stock market crashed.
[02:28:32.495 --> 02:28:47.602]  And then during the 1930s, during the Securities Act of 1933 and 1934, all new regulations were put in place to put a collar, to put a muzzle, a leash on Wall Street, to stop Wall Street from doing what it did in the 20s to bankrupt America.
[02:28:48.206 --> 02:28:55.228]  Well, since that time, in subsequent decades and administrations, all of these regulations— The leash was taken off and they gave methamphetamine to the pit bull.
[02:28:55.228 --> 02:28:56.648]  All removed, exactly.
[02:28:56.648 --> 02:29:02.650]  And so now you've got this out-of-control, voracious monster that all it wants is that free fed money.
[02:29:02.650 --> 02:29:09.251]  And any time you deprive it of another trillion or two from the central bank, they crash the stock market.
[02:29:09.251 --> 02:29:12.332]  And then CNBC will say, the market's crashing!
[02:29:12.332 --> 02:29:13.332]  Trump, do something!
[02:29:13.332 --> 02:29:16.253]  So they're holding us hostage, and Trump's great is failing.
[02:29:16.593 --> 02:29:17.514]  Right.
[02:29:17.514 --> 02:29:18.355]  They are.
[02:29:18.355 --> 02:29:19.496]  We are hostage.
[02:29:19.496 --> 02:29:22.420]  We're being held hostage by the system.
[02:29:22.420 --> 02:29:35.014]  And the only way the system works is if you can print ad nauseum, if you can print infinite amounts of fiat money with no checks and balances like the system is now, because the gold standards, the gold window, were completely obliterated in 1971.
[02:29:36.335 --> 02:29:38.437]  See, look at a chart of inflation and wages.
[02:29:38.437 --> 02:29:40.700]  Look at our wages since 1971.
[02:29:40.700 --> 02:29:44.023]  Before 1971, wages and inflation were roughly parallel.
[02:29:44.023 --> 02:29:46.646]  They were moving up in lockstep.
[02:29:46.646 --> 02:29:48.388]  1971, America closes the gold window.
[02:29:48.388 --> 02:29:54.094]  Oh, suddenly wages go nowhere for 45 years and financialization on Wall Street.
[02:29:54.094 --> 02:29:56.617]  Oh, we've got thousands of billionaires!
[02:29:57.137 --> 02:29:57.397]  Right?
[02:29:57.397 --> 02:29:58.558]  That's what happened.
[02:29:58.558 --> 02:29:59.859]  That's what needs to be fixed.
[02:29:59.859 --> 02:30:00.759]  Yeah, we fed the middle class.
[02:30:00.759 --> 02:30:03.341]  But nobody is in power who will fix it now.
[02:30:03.341 --> 02:30:09.344]  Pelosi or Congress, they are trading on this information and becoming fabulously rich.
[02:30:09.344 --> 02:30:11.926]  They're not going to stop it, Alex, obviously.
[02:30:11.926 --> 02:30:13.467]  They're the ones there.
[02:30:13.467 --> 02:30:14.848]  That's the problem.
[02:30:14.848 --> 02:30:21.191]  Ron Paul, he was the only and the last voice in Congress that stood up and said, we need to audit the Fed.
[02:30:21.191 --> 02:30:22.752]  We need to examine our money.
[02:30:22.752 --> 02:30:24.273]  We need to return to hard money.
[02:30:24.273 --> 02:30:25.374]  He's not there anymore.
[02:30:26.041 --> 02:30:28.026]  Yeah, Trump didn't take control of the Fed.
[02:30:28.026 --> 02:30:29.630]  He literally merged with it.
[02:30:29.630 --> 02:30:30.171]  We'll be right back.

[02:32:35.939 --> 02:32:36.399]  I think?
[02:33:00.413 --> 02:33:00.633]  I don't
[02:33:24.718 --> 02:33:27.628]  Dependent on them, they do not want you to be self-sufficient.

[02:33:33.413 --> 02:33:34.814]  Now it's official.
[02:33:34.814 --> 02:33:55.967]  The United Nations came out yesterday and said the COVID emergency will last five years and the UK government said you must all carry cell phones outside or you'll be arrested because we have to track your social distancing and you're only allowed to have a list of 10 people that you visit and if you go outside that list of 10 you'll be permanently detained.
[02:33:56.807 --> 02:34:08.395]  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is the New World Order, where they let the criminals out of jail, the rapists, the child molesters, the murderers, and where you are now non-essential and a prisoner.
[02:34:08.395 --> 02:34:12.999]  From the beginning of my research, it was clear the globalists are an authoritarian, anti-human group.
[02:34:13.559 --> 02:34:21.080]  They have to put this electronic straitjacket on us before they carry out their endgame, which is global depopulation.
[02:34:21.080 --> 02:34:24.621]  So you see, submitting to them is death.
[02:34:24.621 --> 02:34:31.923]  The only way to stop them is to expose them, to hate their guts, and realize they are humanity's mortal enemy.
[02:34:31.923 --> 02:34:36.763]  Wake up or die.
[02:34:36.763 --> 02:34:39.384]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:34:44.557 --> 02:34:46.018]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:34:46.018 --> 02:34:47.939]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:35:12.145 --> 02:35:12.786]  All right.
[02:35:12.786 --> 02:35:19.291]  I was at Bilderberg with Max Keiser eight, nine years ago in England.
[02:35:19.291 --> 02:35:21.693]  Longer than that.
[02:35:21.693 --> 02:35:22.554]  North of London.
[02:35:22.554 --> 02:35:24.876]  And he's like, I'm gonna give you all this Bitcoin.
[02:35:24.876 --> 02:35:25.716]  Other people offered it to me.
[02:35:25.716 --> 02:35:27.358]  I'm saying, listen, it's not that I'm refusing it.
[02:35:28.211 --> 02:35:33.774]  If I got involved in stock or something, I'd become so obsessed with it that I would never stop paying attention to it.
[02:35:33.774 --> 02:35:37.716]  So I pay attention to information and what's going on politically.
[02:35:37.716 --> 02:35:44.199]  But I mean, surely from where he promoted it, it was worth nothing to, you know, it was one of the biggest things in the market a few years ago.
[02:35:44.199 --> 02:35:45.139]  He said it would go back up.
[02:35:45.139 --> 02:35:45.799]  People said it wouldn't.
[02:35:45.799 --> 02:35:46.400]  It has gone back up.
[02:35:47.153 --> 02:35:54.357]  I'm not here not promoting it because Schiff and people attack it and say that I'm some Bitcoin scammer.
[02:35:54.357 --> 02:35:57.499]  I don't think it's Schiff, it's just very childlike.
[02:35:57.499 --> 02:36:03.123]  It's that if I can't understand something, and I am kind of a troglodyte at certain levels, I just can't pitch it, folks.
[02:36:03.723 --> 02:36:11.950]  But I think if somebody's giving you, and I'm learning about what this deal is, $10 of free Bitcoin, which is a pittance, but it's a good little testing model.
[02:36:11.950 --> 02:36:13.872]  It's like my wife's like, hey, I want to get in the stock market.
[02:36:13.872 --> 02:36:14.553]  I got a little bit of money.
[02:36:14.553 --> 02:36:16.915]  I went out and said, well, just, you know, go do whatever you want.
[02:36:16.915 --> 02:36:19.898]  Just don't put money in there that you can't lose because it's gambling.
[02:36:21.158 --> 02:36:23.039]  And I like the idea.
[02:36:23.039 --> 02:36:24.620]  I wish Bitcoin was legitimate.
[02:36:24.620 --> 02:36:25.181]  Maybe it is.
[02:36:25.181 --> 02:36:27.462]  And I want outside the Federal Reserve.
[02:36:27.462 --> 02:36:28.803]  I want alternative systems.
[02:36:28.803 --> 02:36:30.664]  I totally get the technology.
[02:36:30.664 --> 02:36:31.744]  It's amazing.
[02:36:31.744 --> 02:36:34.546]  My question is, all the shark-like promotion
[02:36:36.129 --> 02:36:39.513]  Evidence today, and I think you believe in your information, Max.
[02:36:39.513 --> 02:36:40.874]  I don't think you're a bad guy.
[02:36:40.874 --> 02:36:42.616]  You're really a acolyte.
[02:36:42.616 --> 02:36:45.820]  You're like a founding father of Bitcoin.
[02:36:45.820 --> 02:36:47.102]  You are a proselytite.
[02:36:47.102 --> 02:36:49.544]  You are a priest, a high priest of this.
[02:36:49.544 --> 02:36:56.833]  But just separately, moving away from that, we'll put out the URL you wanted to put out for folks that want to get $10 of free Bitcoin.
[02:36:57.313 --> 02:37:02.356]  Which I think as long as you take it as that, you know, cheese on the mousetrap, that's fine, folks, a little bit of a test.
[02:37:02.356 --> 02:37:06.078]  You know, it's kind of like going to a random whorehouse, but no, no, no, no, seriously, I'm going to stop being mean.
[02:37:06.078 --> 02:37:08.759]  Let me just ask you this.
[02:37:08.759 --> 02:37:13.942]  Big picture, I know, I respect your view on the economy, and you've been dead on, you know, way better than Schiff.
[02:37:13.942 --> 02:37:16.783]  I mean, Schiff, you know, Lord and Savior over there.
[02:37:16.783 --> 02:37:18.844]  But how bad is this going to get?
[02:37:18.844 --> 02:37:25.368]  Because I see Trump is trying to prop stuff up, because the other alternative is a total depression, and it's kind of the best
[02:37:26.932 --> 02:37:30.056]  Case of two bad choices.
[02:37:30.056 --> 02:37:31.797]  Yeah, I'm going to get to that.
[02:37:31.797 --> 02:37:35.602]  Let me just make one quick 20 second follow up to this Bitcoin conversation.
[02:37:35.602 --> 02:37:36.202]  Okay.
[02:37:36.202 --> 02:37:39.066]  There's two pieces, two main pieces to it.
[02:37:39.066 --> 02:37:40.167]  One is the price.
[02:37:40.802 --> 02:37:47.964]  And the second main piece of discussion point about Bitcoin is how it relates to the economy as a whole.
[02:37:47.964 --> 02:37:56.587]  And I think we could have an entire conversation on how Bitcoin relates to the history of money and the economy as a whole without ever mentioning price.
[02:37:56.587 --> 02:37:57.067]  The price.
[02:37:57.668 --> 02:38:01.430]  It's the least interesting part of Bitcoin, to tell you the truth.
[02:38:01.430 --> 02:38:03.932]  There's a lot more interesting pieces to it.
[02:38:03.932 --> 02:38:06.033]  But to get to your question... And why hasn't it been duplicated yet?
[02:38:06.033 --> 02:38:08.155]  Because you've been saying this for nine years, it won't be duplicated.
[02:38:08.155 --> 02:38:09.155]  You've been proving it right.
[02:38:09.155 --> 02:38:13.878]  The other problem Bitcoin has is all the fake stuff around it.
[02:38:13.878 --> 02:38:18.001]  Well, anytime you have something invaluable, people come out with fake versions of it.
[02:38:18.001 --> 02:38:22.704]  If you go down to the Champs-Élysées in Paris, you'll see fake Gucci bags.
[02:38:23.226 --> 02:38:25.048]  There's fake gold and pyrite.
[02:38:25.048 --> 02:38:26.609]  There's fake diamonds.
[02:38:26.609 --> 02:38:34.556]  Anytime someone perceives something as genuine and real and scarce and desirable, there's a lot of fake that comes out to try to capture it.
[02:38:34.556 --> 02:38:44.564]  In the case of Bitcoin, it came out in 2009, and since then there have been thousands of copies, and they've all proven to be inadequate and fake, and none of them work.
[02:38:44.564 --> 02:38:45.945]  Gosh, it's been 11 years.
[02:38:45.945 --> 02:38:50.169]  So was that 2010 at Bilderberg, you offered me all that Bitcoin, and I was too dumb to download it?
[02:38:50.967 --> 02:39:00.271]  Yes, I offered your audience 10,000 Bitcoin to give away for free at that time, and you wanted to think about it, and you weren't sure whether that was a good idea.
[02:39:00.271 --> 02:39:03.893]  And that's now worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:39:03.893 --> 02:39:07.474]  But you get my trepidation.
[02:39:07.474 --> 02:39:09.775]  But I'm not a timid person.
[02:39:09.775 --> 02:39:11.876]  I charge you on what I know is right.
[02:39:11.876 --> 02:39:13.757]  And I'm not saying you're bad promoting Bitcoin.
[02:39:13.757 --> 02:39:15.158]  I wish I would have done it.
[02:39:15.158 --> 02:39:18.199]  I'm so behind the curve, I don't even know what's going on.
[02:39:18.199 --> 02:39:19.780]  Consider this tough love, Alex.
[02:39:20.336 --> 02:39:21.456]  This is tough love.
[02:39:21.456 --> 02:39:28.018]  I love you so much, but sometimes you just gotta, you know, you gotta foot pedal to the metal and just get your friend over the hump.
[02:39:28.018 --> 02:39:30.959]  You know, they're shy, they're hesitant, they won't take the plunge.
[02:39:30.959 --> 02:39:32.740]  You know, I gotta push you over the cliff.
[02:39:32.740 --> 02:39:34.700]  Just say, look, this is it.
[02:39:34.700 --> 02:39:35.561]  This is the real thing.
[02:39:35.561 --> 02:39:38.641]  You're raping me.
[02:39:38.641 --> 02:39:40.242]  Well, it's love, Alex.
[02:39:40.242 --> 02:39:41.182]  It's love.
[02:39:41.182 --> 02:39:43.543]  But the point is that there's an entire... Some Joe Biden love?
[02:39:45.295 --> 02:39:46.696]  Can I sniff your hair?
[02:39:46.696 --> 02:39:47.016]  Please.
[02:39:47.016 --> 02:39:48.516]  Here, I'll come over here.
[02:39:48.516 --> 02:39:49.256]  Oh, you're on the screen.
[02:39:49.256 --> 02:39:49.896]  Go ahead.
[02:39:49.896 --> 02:39:52.197]  Go ahead and start sniffing.
[02:39:52.197 --> 02:39:54.237]  But the, uh, oh yeah, that's good.
[02:39:54.237 --> 02:39:59.639]  Oh, is that, that's, uh, wow, that's vitality.
[02:39:59.639 --> 02:40:00.459]  Oh yeah.
[02:40:00.459 --> 02:40:01.339]  Oh, oh, oh yeah.
[02:40:01.339 --> 02:40:02.179]  That's great.
[02:40:02.179 --> 02:40:05.440]  Oh, look, a genie's coming out of your ear.
[02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:12.482]  But, uh, to get back to your question about the economy, uh, is that the reason why it's hopeless,
[02:40:13.078 --> 02:40:16.700]  Is because to get back to this theme of debt money, right?
[02:40:16.700 --> 02:40:24.884]  When you just float debt money into the economy, you create deflation, which means that everything becomes encumbered with debt, right?
[02:40:24.884 --> 02:40:27.085]  If you have too much debt, you have a problem.
[02:40:27.085 --> 02:40:32.188]  And so America has the debt to GDP is over 100%.
[02:40:32.188 --> 02:40:37.650]  Around the world, the debt to GDP is close to 300% debt to GDP.
[02:40:37.650 --> 02:40:42.573]  So when you talk to the economists like Paul Krugman of the New York Times or Stiglitz,
[02:40:42.793 --> 02:40:46.036]  So what are you predicting is going to happen?
[02:40:46.036 --> 02:40:46.457]  Just tell me.
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:40:57.200]  Neo-feudalism.
[02:40:57.200 --> 02:41:00.301]  I think that they're going to continue to print more debt.
[02:41:00.301 --> 02:41:03.482]  So they'll just steal the whole economy and leave us with no economy.
[02:41:03.482 --> 02:41:05.162]  It'll be a bifurcated economy.
[02:41:05.162 --> 02:41:09.003]  By the way, do you know how powerful the meme will be if you rub my shoulders and sniff my hair?
[02:41:09.003 --> 02:41:10.483]  Can we do this live on air right now together?
[02:41:10.483 --> 02:41:11.344]  Just come on.
[02:41:11.344 --> 02:41:12.264]  I'm selling your Bitcoin.
[02:41:12.264 --> 02:41:13.604]  I haven't got money yet.
[02:41:13.604 --> 02:41:15.045]  I'll rub your shoulders.
[02:41:15.045 --> 02:41:21.066]  I'll rub your shoulders and smell your hair as long as you repeat swanbitcoin.com forward slash Alex.
[02:41:21.066 --> 02:41:21.486]  Do it.
[02:41:21.486 --> 02:41:22.566]  Do it.
[02:41:22.566 --> 02:41:22.786]  All right.
[02:41:22.786 --> 02:41:23.847]  You ready?
[02:41:23.847 --> 02:41:24.627]  Count me in.
[02:41:24.627 --> 02:41:25.207]  Count me in, buddy.
[02:41:26.212 --> 02:41:27.612]  All right.
[02:41:27.612 --> 02:41:28.172]  How's this?
[02:41:28.172 --> 02:41:28.533]  Yeah.
[02:41:28.533 --> 02:41:30.073]  You gotta rub the shoulders.
[02:41:30.073 --> 02:41:31.333]  Where are your shoulders?
[02:41:31.333 --> 02:41:33.194]  I'm looking at a camera.
[02:41:33.194 --> 02:41:33.794]  I don't see you.
[02:41:33.794 --> 02:41:35.214]  I don't have no image of you.
[02:41:35.214 --> 02:41:36.054]  I need direction.
[02:41:36.054 --> 02:41:37.735]  Can you direct me please?
[02:41:37.735 --> 02:41:39.015]  Where's your producer?
[02:41:39.015 --> 02:41:41.236]  Is your producer under the table again?
[02:41:41.236 --> 02:41:43.896]  Stop playing with guns and start producing.
[02:41:43.896 --> 02:41:45.297]  You're the producer.
[02:41:45.297 --> 02:41:48.297]  Spill me.
[02:41:48.297 --> 02:41:49.898]  Now you can be the vice president.
[02:41:50.819 --> 02:41:53.641]  See, I'm ready to be Vice President.
[02:41:53.641 --> 02:41:55.922]  This is a new level of TV, folks.
[02:41:55.922 --> 02:41:58.063]  It's interactive.
[02:41:58.063 --> 02:42:00.785]  It's better than Smell-O-Vision.
[02:42:00.785 --> 02:42:04.507]  Dude, you're a blind Joe Biden groping an Alex Jones live on TV.
[02:42:04.507 --> 02:42:06.228]  Imagine what that's like.
[02:42:06.228 --> 02:42:07.168]  You're looking at a computer screen.
[02:42:07.168 --> 02:42:09.129]  Oh my God, I'm sorry to do that to you.
[02:42:09.129 --> 02:42:12.211]  And under my desk right now is Rachel Maddow.
[02:42:12.211 --> 02:42:14.012]  I'm not gay, but that is a hot dude.
[02:42:14.012 --> 02:42:14.232]  Hey, look.
[02:42:14.232 --> 02:42:14.892]  Have you seen this?
[02:42:14.892 --> 02:42:16.253]  Look.
[02:42:16.253 --> 02:42:17.414]  I'm wearing my yoga shirts.
[02:42:18.390 --> 02:42:19.731]  Can you see my yoga pants?
[02:42:19.731 --> 02:42:20.331]  Let's not.
[02:42:20.331 --> 02:42:21.971]  Be careful there, Max.
[02:42:21.971 --> 02:42:22.812]  Don't let that lizard up.
[02:42:22.812 --> 02:42:23.872]  Look at that.
[02:42:23.872 --> 02:42:25.113]  Can you see my yoga pants?
[02:42:25.113 --> 02:42:27.494]  Those are very nice legs.
[02:42:27.494 --> 02:42:31.335]  You look like a tranny like Michelle Obama.
[02:42:31.335 --> 02:42:32.936]  Yeah, I'm bringing back the 70s.
[02:42:32.936 --> 02:42:37.177]  The word is that you and Michelle are both... Hot pants are coming back, Alex.
[02:42:37.177 --> 02:42:42.659]  Hot pants are coming back at SwampBitcoin.com forward slash Alex.
[02:42:42.659 --> 02:42:44.120]  $10 free Bitcoin.
[02:42:44.120 --> 02:42:45.421]  All right, this has been fun.
[02:42:45.421 --> 02:42:46.261]  When do you register?
[02:42:47.233 --> 02:42:49.175]  I apologize.
[02:42:49.175 --> 02:42:50.637]  No lizards were hurt in the filming of this.
[02:42:50.637 --> 02:42:51.738]  Take the plunge, Alex!
[02:42:51.738 --> 02:42:53.359]  Don't be shy!
[02:42:53.359 --> 02:42:54.741]  Be a man!
[02:42:54.741 --> 02:42:59.786]  Put your .50 caliber gun away and own some Bitcoin and tell Peter Schiff what's up!
[02:42:59.786 --> 02:43:00.787]  He's a moron!
[02:43:00.787 --> 02:43:05.192]  He's been wrong for nine years and now you're going to be part of the New World Order!
[02:43:05.192 --> 02:43:07.334]  Peter Schiff is my daddy.
[02:43:07.334 --> 02:43:09.777]  He told me you're bad, so that's why you're on the show today.
[02:43:10.936 --> 02:43:12.617]  He's been wrong for nine years straight.
[02:43:12.617 --> 02:43:13.938]  He hasn't been right about a single thing.
[02:43:13.938 --> 02:43:15.740]  Listen, I'm not in a pissing contest.
[02:43:15.740 --> 02:43:19.303]  He's just like, Jones finally sold out for the money.
[02:43:19.303 --> 02:43:20.243]  And I'm like...
[02:43:22.389 --> 02:43:23.610]  Sold out for the money.
[02:43:23.610 --> 02:43:24.911]  I want Bitcoin to be real.
[02:43:24.911 --> 02:43:27.894]  I want a currency they don't control so I can go anywhere I want.
[02:43:27.894 --> 02:43:29.255]  Is Peter Schiff a priest?
[02:43:29.255 --> 02:43:30.617]  Is Peter Schiff a nun?
[02:43:30.617 --> 02:43:35.841]  He's in a nunnery praying all day and he's totally outside of the profit motive?
[02:43:35.841 --> 02:43:42.968]  I didn't know Peter Schiff was a philanthropist who just sits and prays all day in a... Peter Schiff, get thee to a nunnery!
[02:43:43.388 --> 02:43:53.618]  I mean, to accuse somebody else of being, uh, seeking to be in business is quite rich from a guy who's been done nothing but rip folks off for 20 straight years.
[02:43:53.618 --> 02:43:56.441]  I don't have any proof of that.
[02:43:58.523 --> 02:44:01.206]  The proof is in all of his recommendations.
[02:44:01.206 --> 02:44:03.928]  I didn't mean to go off on a shit-jag.
[02:44:03.928 --> 02:44:08.912]  He just, the last time you were on, like, Jones finally sold out to the money.
[02:44:08.912 --> 02:44:11.735]  In fact, that check hasn't arrived yet, Kaiser.
[02:44:11.735 --> 02:44:15.919]  All right, he's the most over- Well, let's talk about somebody else.
[02:44:15.919 --> 02:44:17.080]  Pick somebody else to pick on.
[02:44:17.080 --> 02:44:18.281]  I'm happy to pick on anybody.
[02:44:18.281 --> 02:44:19.522]  It doesn't have to be Peter Schiff.
[02:44:19.522 --> 02:44:20.422]  Unfortunately, we're out of time.
[02:44:20.422 --> 02:44:21.263]  He's so stint at this point.
[02:44:21.263 --> 02:44:22.785]  Paul Joseph Watson's taking over.
[02:44:23.405 --> 02:44:24.946]  Max Cosgrove, thank you very much.
[02:44:24.946 --> 02:44:28.810]  You know, Max is crazy, I'm crazy, we get together, crazy things happen.
[02:44:28.810 --> 02:44:32.112]  But if you're a TV viewer, you really missed him groping me over there.
[02:44:32.112 --> 02:44:35.275]  This is a huge Bitcoin promotion.
[02:44:35.275 --> 02:44:39.058]  I have no doubt that it's just as valuable as the Federal Reserve notes.
[02:44:39.058 --> 02:44:42.601]  Which means it's faith and credit, what's behind it, and that's that.
[02:44:42.601 --> 02:44:45.604]  And so, I just...
[02:44:49.002 --> 02:44:54.148]  You know, I wasn't going to get involved in Bitcoin until Chef told me that I'd sold out to it.
[02:44:54.148 --> 02:44:58.914]  And I'm like that close just because it's a new currency.
[02:44:58.914 --> 02:45:00.636]  And I just have watched it.
[02:45:00.636 --> 02:45:03.719]  It's like, I'm not supposed to be involved in this.
[02:45:03.719 --> 02:45:05.101]  But then I was about to do it.
[02:45:05.101 --> 02:45:06.403]  Then Kaiser just did that whole...
[02:45:08.933 --> 02:45:10.574]  This whole audience was just gang-raped.
[02:45:10.574 --> 02:45:11.815]  I mean, I hope you all realize that.
[02:45:11.815 --> 02:45:12.335]  But it's okay.
[02:45:12.335 --> 02:45:13.776]  It's alright.
[02:45:13.776 --> 02:45:14.816]  At least Kaiser's insane.
[02:45:14.816 --> 02:45:17.198]  He doesn't take himself too seriously.
[02:45:17.198 --> 02:45:23.501]  And that's important when you're crazy.
[02:45:23.501 --> 02:45:25.822]  This is the end, my friends.
[02:45:25.822 --> 02:45:27.944]  My only friends, the end.
[02:45:27.944 --> 02:45:30.505]  Of our elaborate plans, the end.
[02:45:30.505 --> 02:45:33.667]  Of everything that stands, the end.
[02:45:33.667 --> 02:45:34.767]  The safety.
[02:45:34.767 --> 02:45:35.368]  The delusion.
[02:45:36.277 --> 02:45:38.458]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:45:38.458 --> 02:45:41.679]  Because there was only the mirage of safety.
[02:45:41.679 --> 02:45:44.820]  Movies and partying and living like children.
[02:45:44.820 --> 02:45:47.981]  Never growing up, never caring about other people.
[02:45:47.981 --> 02:45:51.683]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[02:45:51.683 --> 02:45:54.664]  Just like the history books show us, just like the Bible states.
[02:45:54.664 --> 02:45:59.746]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God, they were brought into captivity.
[02:46:00.677 --> 02:46:05.481]  Because their people sold out to special interests and were infiltrated by spies.
[02:46:05.481 --> 02:46:07.703]  And then they were enslaved.
[02:46:07.703 --> 02:46:09.765]  We are repeating that again today.
[02:46:09.765 --> 02:46:15.690]  Compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage.
[02:46:15.690 --> 02:46:17.772]  Infowars has decided to fight for freedom.
[02:46:17.772 --> 02:46:21.656]  And Infowars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[02:46:23.507 --> 02:46:31.255]  InfoWars has become a symbol, an emblem, of not just American freedom, but worldwide Maverick spirit.
[02:46:31.255 --> 02:46:36.100]  It's not just myself or the host at InfoWars, or the researchers, or the journalists.
[02:46:36.100 --> 02:46:41.085]  It's you, the listeners, the activists, the people on the front lines, in the arena.
[02:46:41.085 --> 02:46:44.729]  It's the amazing guests and individuals that we interview.
[02:46:45.169 --> 02:46:49.973]  They make InfoWars so special because we're not putting a filter in front of free minds.
[02:46:49.973 --> 02:47:00.561]  We're having an open discussion about the real state of the world, not the establishment and talking points that are put out by the Council on Foreign Relations, the Bilderberg Group, Davos Group, and other globalists.
[02:47:01.161 --> 02:47:09.324]  We're pushing for a pro-human future where we build a planet and beyond based on humans, for humans, by humans.
[02:47:09.324 --> 02:47:16.528]  Not a world where the establishment hate themselves, project their hate onto us and decide we're going to have a post-human world.
[02:47:16.528 --> 02:47:19.529]  I'm really excited to know that InfoWars has your support.
[02:47:19.529 --> 02:47:26.252]  I want to thank you all for being pro-human and pro-God.
[02:47:26.252 --> 02:47:28.893]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:48.376 --> 02:47:54.718]  Alright, I like Max Keiser, but it always turns into a train wreck of some wild west craziness.
[02:47:54.718 --> 02:47:56.198]  Paul Joseph Watson's about to take over.
[02:47:56.198 --> 02:47:58.019]  We're talking to DJ Amy and Bob.
[02:47:58.019 --> 02:48:02.780]  Let's go ahead and talk to DJ in New York.
[02:48:02.780 --> 02:48:05.481]  Friends is a hospital administrator.
[02:48:05.481 --> 02:48:08.081]  Had a lot of medical workers calling earlier, but what's your view on COVID-19?
[02:48:08.081 --> 02:48:10.022]  Go ahead.
[02:48:10.022 --> 02:48:15.363]  Well, whatever you want to call it or whatever you want to say it is, I had it.
[02:48:15.363 --> 02:48:17.804]  I caught it on a subway car in February.
[02:48:18.433 --> 02:48:22.954]  When most people didn't realize how fast it was coming here.
[02:48:22.954 --> 02:48:32.776]  And I got in the car, and I smelled the dead bacteria in the air, and the door closed behind me, and I knew I was stuck, and I knew by the next week I'd be feeling something, and I did.
[02:48:32.776 --> 02:48:34.716]  And let me tell you something.
[02:48:34.716 --> 02:48:38.597]  That thing filled up my lungs just about to the top.
[02:48:38.597 --> 02:48:41.138]  I had to sleep upright for two weeks.
[02:48:41.138 --> 02:48:46.279]  And truthfully, if I didn't have my silver bullet with me,
[02:48:46.989 --> 02:48:49.251]  I think I would have been in more trouble.
[02:48:49.251 --> 02:49:01.323]  I took Silver Bullet every day, and I took some powdered vitamin C, and a drug called naproxen, an anti-inflammatory drug that I have, it took down the swelling.
[02:49:01.323 --> 02:49:09.331]  And my body was naturally able to drain off the water, but I lost... I was about to say, they don't want people to know that it's anti-inflammatories that have been beating them.
[02:49:10.526 --> 02:49:11.906]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:49:11.906 --> 02:49:14.007]  Definitely made all the difference in the world.
[02:49:14.007 --> 02:49:15.007]  So you went through this.
[02:49:15.007 --> 02:49:18.748]  How evil is it that they know all this and don't tell people?
[02:49:18.748 --> 02:49:25.810]  Well, it's even more evil than that from what I know from a friend who is a, uh, he works in a hospital.
[02:49:25.810 --> 02:49:29.610]  He's an administrator at one of the top respiratory hospitals in the East Coast.
[02:49:29.610 --> 02:49:31.551]  We just put it that way.
[02:49:31.551 --> 02:49:35.972]  And the stuff that he told me that's been going on, and he's an electronic specialist,
[02:49:37.082 --> 02:49:44.145]  Don't think for a minute that 5G doesn't have something to do with the kill rate in all these areas where it's more developed.
[02:49:44.145 --> 02:49:44.386]  Okay?
[02:49:44.386 --> 02:49:45.586]  Because it definitely does.
[02:49:45.586 --> 02:49:47.927]  I want to say something before you got to move on to Paul.
[02:49:47.927 --> 02:49:52.249]  I want to get a lot of intel out in a few seconds here, a few minutes.
[02:49:52.249 --> 02:49:57.632]  First of all, all of the respirators, the, uh, what do you call them?
[02:49:57.632 --> 02:49:59.293]  The ventilators?
[02:49:59.293 --> 02:50:01.794]  They're all operated by Wi-Fi.
[02:50:02.600 --> 02:50:06.862]  And they all have that Chinese chip that can be remotely controlled.
[02:50:06.862 --> 02:50:11.964]  Well, my friend came into the hospital one morning, and the nurses were all upset.
[02:50:11.964 --> 02:50:21.808]  Somebody had died, maybe more than one person, and the ventilators went a little kilter overnight, and they started going up higher than they were supposed to.
[02:50:21.808 --> 02:50:28.511]  So this is something that people need to know about, aside from all the other horror stories that people are coming forward about.
[02:50:28.511 --> 02:50:29.191]  And, you know,
[02:50:30.767 --> 02:50:33.088]  The 5G is a whole lot of stuff.
[02:50:33.088 --> 02:50:34.389]  We know that.
[02:50:34.389 --> 02:50:38.590]  And the medical field and this disaster that's going on is just one of them.
[02:50:38.590 --> 02:50:42.251]  And just a side note, as far as Max, I love Max Keiser.
[02:50:42.251 --> 02:50:45.173]  I didn't mind waiting a while to listen to him.
[02:50:45.173 --> 02:50:57.017]  But all that stuff that he's talking about, which you wouldn't get into, is it's all controlled by blockchain, which is going to be working with the 5G and the Internet of Things.
[02:50:57.017 --> 02:50:58.778]  When do you know when to get out of that?
[02:50:58.778 --> 02:50:59.558]  That's the issue.
[02:51:00.037 --> 02:51:06.704]  Because you're not going to be able to get your money once they make all kinds of Mark of the Beast requirements.
[02:51:06.704 --> 02:51:08.766]  You'll be stuck if you didn't get your money out.
[02:51:08.766 --> 02:51:09.967]  So there's a problem.
[02:51:09.967 --> 02:51:15.212]  Go to Anthony Patch and look what he has to say about blockchain, the Christian truther.
[02:51:15.212 --> 02:51:18.976]  OK, so Alex, I came to the Lord in the 80s.
[02:51:18.976 --> 02:51:22.659]  I felt like I was in the wilderness until you came on the scene.
[02:51:22.659 --> 02:51:24.041]  You were a breath of fresh air.
[02:51:24.728 --> 02:51:31.571]  And just so you understand, I worked in Intel, delivering Intel to NYPD for over 30 years.
[02:51:31.571 --> 02:51:33.912]  I could do a whole show with you, okay?
[02:51:33.912 --> 02:51:53.040]  So the thing is this, what's going on now, having to do with all this demonic activity, I got an awareness in the Tompkins Square Park riot, and then I shared that with Mike Taibbi, which I ended up on this middle-end dollar catamaran with him one day, went out stealing and told him about
[02:51:53.886 --> 02:51:55.567]  What was going on in my neighborhood?
[02:51:55.567 --> 02:52:04.610]  If you want to look at what Antifa looked like in the 1980s, just go to the video clips called a Cult of Rage on YouTube.
[02:52:04.610 --> 02:52:06.111]  I'm responsible for that being there.
[02:52:06.111 --> 02:52:07.912]  I tipped off Mike.
[02:52:07.912 --> 02:52:08.952]  Let me get your name and number.
[02:52:08.952 --> 02:52:09.933]  You sound super interesting.
[02:52:09.933 --> 02:52:11.253]  Let's get DJ on as a guest.
[02:52:11.253 --> 02:52:13.074]  And I'm sorry to Amy and I'm sorry to Bob.
[02:52:13.074 --> 02:52:14.174]  Call me back tomorrow.
[02:52:14.174 --> 02:52:17.836]  Paul Watson is about to take over and we've got to get him on with you.
[02:52:17.836 --> 02:52:19.277]  But get Amy and Bob's number.
[02:52:19.277 --> 02:52:20.117]  Guys, call them back tomorrow.
[02:52:20.117 --> 02:52:21.437]  We're going to take their calls.
[02:52:21.437 --> 02:52:22.398]  And let's get DJ on as a guest.
[02:52:23.018 --> 02:52:24.920]  Alright, Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[02:52:24.920 --> 02:52:28.503]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Fan.Video.
[02:52:28.503 --> 02:52:31.325]  Please spread the links.
[02:52:31.325 --> 02:52:32.907]  Memorial Day is here.
[02:52:32.907 --> 02:52:35.108]  It's one of the biggest sales of the year.
[02:52:35.108 --> 02:52:39.872]  Now, we were already running a huge sale, but we're having to end that one because a bunch of items are selling out.
[02:52:39.872 --> 02:52:48.480]  But all the items we have left in stock are still on record sale, and then five items that weren't off sale that we got back in stock, they're also massively discounted as well.
[02:52:48.800 --> 02:52:50.381]  For the Memorial Day Special.
[02:52:50.381 --> 02:52:51.321]  So here it is.

[02:53:02.787 --> 02:53:06.188]  Chill Force, it's incredible, 60% off.

[02:53:18.375 --> 02:53:20.036]  Again, thank you all for watching.
[02:53:20.036 --> 02:53:26.880]  We appreciate your support, your financial support, but it's also supporting you and your family with amazing products that are so good for you and your body.
[02:53:26.880 --> 02:53:28.381]  Again, thank you all for your support.
[02:53:28.381 --> 02:53:29.302]  We are all in this together.
[02:53:35.820 --> 02:53:46.444]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[02:53:46.444 --> 02:53:51.526]  I've been waiting expectantly for our two minutes of hate.
[02:53:51.526 --> 02:53:59.810]  There was supposed to be a nationwide Boo for Boris event at 8pm tonight in the United Kingdom.
[02:53:59.810 --> 02:54:01.771]  It's now six minutes past 8pm.
[02:54:01.771 --> 02:54:05.252]  I was looking out the window, didn't hear a peep.
[02:54:05.911 --> 02:54:14.452]  So the nationwide boo for Boris, the Orwellian two minutes of hate directed against our Prime Minister, for what reason I'll get into here in a second.
[02:54:15.225 --> 02:54:16.186]  Did not come off.
[02:54:16.186 --> 02:54:18.788]  It wasn't even trending on Twitter at the time.
[02:54:18.788 --> 02:54:24.192]  And, as you can see from that tweet, it fell flat on its arse, as we say here in the United Kingdom.
[02:54:24.192 --> 02:54:43.006]  Unlike the clap for the NHS event, which has achieved such religiosity and cult-like status that it happens vehemently every Thursday at 8pm without fail, but now even the founder of that applaud the NHS, applaud the health workers movement, is saying that it's become too politicised
[02:54:43.627 --> 02:54:45.488]  Too cringe, I would say.
[02:54:45.488 --> 02:54:54.012]  And now that is set to end with the last mass communist-style applause for government healthcare this Thursday at 8pm.
[02:54:54.012 --> 02:54:57.033]  I'm sure some people will be taking part in that.
[02:54:57.033 --> 02:55:09.880]  But from what I heard, in an area which is controlled by a Labour council, so you expect there to be a lot of Labour voters here taking part in Booth for Boris, didn't hear a single one.
[02:55:09.880 --> 02:55:10.500]  What a failure.
[02:55:11.249 --> 02:55:12.129]  What's it all about?
[02:55:12.129 --> 02:55:17.711]  Well, there's a headline here out of Sputnik, and this has been going on for nearly a week.
[02:55:17.711 --> 02:55:38.897]  People aren't angry about the fact that we've got thousands of boat migrants just showing up on the south coast of England, being given a taxi service by our government, being handed over by the French Navy to the British Navy to invade our country, then let out into the general population, I'm sure, once their totally legitimate asylum claims are processed.
[02:55:38.897 --> 02:55:40.318]  Of course, some of those migrants
[02:55:41.297 --> 02:55:45.839]  We're threatening to kill their own children if they weren't let into the country.
[02:55:45.839 --> 02:55:48.700]  But these people only want the best life for their children.
[02:55:48.700 --> 02:55:50.161]  That's why they're trying to get here.
[02:55:50.161 --> 02:55:51.501]  They don't care about that.
[02:55:51.501 --> 02:56:01.085]  They don't care about the fact that the lockdown, which was imposed by Boris Johnson, and you think that the lefties, the Labour voters, would oppose him on this.
[02:56:01.085 --> 02:56:02.866]  The lockdown itself?
[02:56:02.866 --> 02:56:03.346]  No.
[02:56:03.346 --> 02:56:05.647]  They want the lockdown to go on forever.
[02:56:05.647 --> 02:56:07.508]  They want it to be more strict.
[02:56:07.508 --> 02:56:09.809]  You would think that that would be a good standpoint.
[02:56:10.683 --> 02:56:16.588]  For them to express their opposition to Boris Johnson, of course, leader of the Conservative Party.
[02:56:16.588 --> 02:56:17.809]  But no.
[02:56:17.809 --> 02:56:20.050]  They're angry about something else.
[02:56:20.050 --> 02:56:22.272]  There's a headline out of Sputnik.
[02:56:22.272 --> 02:56:23.413]  Shame on you!
[02:56:23.413 --> 02:56:28.657]  Protesters meet Dominic Cummings with chants in front of his home in London.
[02:56:28.657 --> 02:56:37.004]  And for the past four or five days, vicious, hateful left-wing protesters have been outside Dominic Cummings' home in London,
[02:56:37.955 --> 02:56:45.741]  Dominic Cummings is a senior advisor and aide to Prime Minister Boris Johnson here in the UK.
[02:56:45.741 --> 02:56:54.106]  Just by coincidence, he was also basically the mastermind of the Brexit campaign, the Vote Leave campaign.
[02:56:54.106 --> 02:57:01.452]  So do they hate him for what he did or do they hate him for the fact that he was instrumental in taking the United Kingdom out of the European Union?
[02:57:01.452 --> 02:57:03.573]  Well, what did he do?
[02:57:03.573 --> 02:57:04.714]  Well, back in March,
[02:57:05.894 --> 02:57:25.185]  When Dominic Cummings and his wife both got ill at roughly the same time, his wife had potential coronavirus symptoms, Dominic Cummings had all the classic symptoms of coronavirus, and he's somebody who you would expect to be at risk from getting it, because of course he works within government.
[02:57:25.185 --> 02:57:26.706]  Boris Johnson himself got it.
[02:57:28.098 --> 02:57:30.279]  So they both fell ill.
[02:57:30.279 --> 02:57:43.305]  He was concerned about needing urgent childcare to look after his four-year-old son in case he, his wife, or both of them were in hospital and ill with coronavirus.
[02:57:43.305 --> 02:57:51.068]  So they claim he broke the lockdown law to travel 500 miles north to Durham in the north of England.
[02:57:51.812 --> 02:57:53.753]  To visit his parents.
[02:57:53.753 --> 02:58:11.022]  Turned out he wasn't visiting his parents, he was urgently arranging childcare for his four-year-old son to hand him over to his parents while he isolated in a cottage, a separate building that was on the property of his parents up north in Durham.
[02:58:11.022 --> 02:58:13.964]  Again, sounds like a dastardly cardinal sin, doesn't it?
[02:58:14.522 --> 02:58:25.164]  For the past five years, five days in the UK, the media has been baying for his blood, demanding his resignation.
[02:58:25.164 --> 02:58:29.305]  Hateful left-wing protesters have been outside his front door the past four days.
[02:58:29.305 --> 02:58:41.268]  Oh, and by the way, these social distancing regulations that the media is apparently so concerned about don't seem to apply to the media itself.
[02:58:41.268 --> 02:58:43.008]  Michael Hever tweeted earlier today,
[02:58:44.304 --> 02:58:46.165]  And it's on my timeline, I retweeted it.
[02:58:46.165 --> 02:58:51.126]  So the same social distancing rules that the entire country supposedly irate at Dominic Cummings for
[02:59:03.436 --> 02:59:18.099]  Disobeying or not being obeyed by the throngs of journalists who are packed tightly together, none of them obeying social distancing rules as they clamour outside his house harassing him along with the left-wing protesters.
[02:59:18.099 --> 02:59:29.362]  And for the past two days here in the UK on Twitter, media scum or hashtag scum media has been trending because again these people have completely
[02:59:30.399 --> 02:59:42.388]  Jettisoned any pretense of impartiality and they've been, again, weaponized as political tools to try and get Dominic Cummings fired because he was the mastermind of Brexit.
[02:59:42.388 --> 02:59:46.371]  This is all about Brexit, make no mistake about it.
[02:59:46.371 --> 02:59:51.054]  It's not about a car journey two months ago.
[02:59:51.054 --> 02:59:59.220]  By the way, the architects of the lockdown itself, of course, we covered this story a couple of weeks ago, Professor Ferguson, whose model
[03:00:00.365 --> 03:00:05.448]  The entire policy of the country was based on, not just the UK, other countries as well.
[03:00:05.448 --> 03:00:09.530]  He said 500,000 people would die of coronavirus.
[03:00:09.530 --> 03:00:17.834]  This is a guy whose every previous prediction, whether it be on SARS, foot and mouth disease, or a number of others, was spectacularly wrong.
[03:00:17.834 --> 03:00:18.914]  We believed him.
[03:00:18.914 --> 03:00:20.855]  We'd locked down the entire country.
[03:00:20.855 --> 03:00:23.597]  Now we're going to face the consequences of that.
[03:00:23.597 --> 03:00:24.197]  This guy,
[03:00:25.382 --> 03:00:32.446]  He didn't travel to a different part of England, breaking the lockdown to find urgent care for his child.
[03:00:32.446 --> 03:00:36.068]  He broke the lockdown to have sex with a married woman.
[03:00:36.068 --> 03:00:38.610]  That was in the media for about 24 hours.
[03:00:38.610 --> 03:00:44.253]  The outrage in comparison to this outrage over Dominic Cummings was minimal.
[03:00:44.253 --> 03:00:51.017]  We had another politician, Ian Blackford, who travelled from Westminster
[03:00:51.821 --> 03:00:54.622]  Up to Scotland to visit his family.
[03:00:54.622 --> 03:01:00.804]  The exact same charge that they leveled against Dominic Cummings, even though it later turned out that's not what he was doing anyway.
[03:01:00.804 --> 03:01:04.466]  He was giving his toddler over to his parents so they could care for him.
[03:01:04.466 --> 03:01:08.907]  This guy, Ian Blackford, did the same thing but worse.
[03:01:08.907 --> 03:01:13.569]  And then two days later, he's tweeting at Dominic Cummings.
[03:01:13.569 --> 03:01:15.029]  I'm afraid this sums it up.
[03:01:15.029 --> 03:01:17.010]  One rule for them and another for the rest of us.
[03:01:17.839 --> 03:01:20.280]  He did the exact same thing.
[03:01:20.280 --> 03:01:21.500]  The media said nothing.
[03:01:21.500 --> 03:01:21.860]  Why?
[03:01:21.860 --> 03:01:26.761]  Because he's in the SNP, which is the left-wing party in Scotland.
[03:01:26.761 --> 03:01:28.422]  They call it the Nationalist Party.
[03:01:28.422 --> 03:01:29.622]  It's everything but.
[03:01:29.622 --> 03:01:31.422]  It is far left.
[03:01:31.422 --> 03:01:37.484]  So Professor Lockdown can break the lockdown law to shag a married woman having an affair.
[03:01:37.484 --> 03:01:41.725]  This MP from Scotland can break the lockdown to visit his parents.
[03:01:42.731 --> 03:01:45.913]  But they're both left-wingers, so it doesn't matter.
[03:01:45.913 --> 03:01:47.315]  Somebody on the right does it.
[03:01:47.315 --> 03:01:49.736]  The media's camped out his house for a week.
[03:01:49.736 --> 03:01:52.238]  He's getting shouted at by his own neighbours.
[03:01:52.238 --> 03:02:00.725]  They're driving vans past with giant TV screens, playing the family members of crying coronavirus victims.
[03:02:00.725 --> 03:02:01.966]  But they don't care about any of that.
[03:02:01.966 --> 03:02:03.307]  They only care about Brexit.
[03:02:03.307 --> 03:02:05.849]  And in fact, it's now come out
[03:02:06.556 --> 03:02:20.486]  That while Dominic Cummings was ill, while he was almost certainly about to maybe have to go into hospital, there came up an attempt to delay Brexit even further and he was the one who shot it down.
[03:02:20.486 --> 03:02:22.147]  So thank God that that happened.
[03:02:22.147 --> 03:02:26.591]  That's the real reason that they were angry about it.
[03:02:26.591 --> 03:02:29.313]  Mark Antwerp on Twitter tweets about this.
[03:02:29.313 --> 03:02:31.955]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:02:39.495 --> 03:02:44.838]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour, with Paul S. Watson.
[03:03:01.175 --> 03:03:05.437]  Who broke the law to go and shag a married woman in London.
[03:03:05.437 --> 03:03:12.781]  There's no proviso, there's no exemption for having sex with a married woman in the lockdown law that I've seen.
[03:03:12.781 --> 03:03:15.162]  Now what there is an exemption for is this.
[03:03:15.162 --> 03:03:17.303]  The lockdown law in this country says, quote,
[03:03:18.780 --> 03:03:23.002]  If you have children, keep following this advice to the best of your ability.
[03:03:23.002 --> 03:03:26.883]  However, we are aware that not all these measures will be possible.
[03:03:26.883 --> 03:03:29.684]  And in the case of Dominic Cummings, that was not possible.
[03:03:29.684 --> 03:03:42.809]  That's why he had to drive to the north of the country, where his parents lived, to hand over his child so they could care for him, because there was a very real possibility that either he, his wife, or both of them would have ended up in hospital.
[03:03:42.809 --> 03:03:43.689]  That's why he did it.
[03:03:43.689 --> 03:03:48.051]  He gave a big press conference yesterday explaining this, but they still want blood.
[03:03:48.749 --> 03:04:01.317]  The reason why Media Scum is still trending today, along with Scum Media on Twitter, at least the UK Twitter, is because this harassment campaign has been led by the media.
[03:04:01.317 --> 03:04:13.805]  To the point where they're now going up to the residence of his parents, even though he's not there anymore, ringing the bell on his elderly parents' home to try and get them to come out and to try and harass them.
[03:04:14.437 --> 03:04:22.501]  This is another example of media-generated hysteria and harassment, and it shows no signs of ending.
[03:04:22.501 --> 03:04:24.742]  Now, why is he under the spotlight?
[03:04:24.742 --> 03:04:26.403]  It has nothing to do with COVID-19.
[03:04:26.403 --> 03:04:39.108]  There you see the Sky News journalist trying to harass his elderly parents at the home in Durham, even though Cummings himself, Dominic Cummings, is not even there anymore.
[03:04:39.108 --> 03:04:40.429]  David Adams tweets,
[03:04:41.639 --> 03:04:44.581]  Civil service coup to keep us in the EU.
[03:04:44.581 --> 03:04:49.824]  When Boris was hospitalised Sir Mark Sedwell tried to extend the transition period.
[03:04:49.824 --> 03:04:51.304]  Cummings stopped him.
[03:04:51.304 --> 03:04:54.246]  There's also an article here out of Breitbart.
[03:04:54.246 --> 03:04:54.786]  Barrage!
[03:04:54.786 --> 03:05:07.693]  Remainers want Cummings out as an excuse to delay Brexit because all along the line Cummings has steadfastly held his position when it comes to refusing to extend that deadline when it comes to Brexit.
[03:05:07.693 --> 03:05:08.654]  Of course we had that
[03:05:09.597 --> 03:05:18.825]  Big event back on January 31st where we left the EU or at least entered into the stages of pulling out of the EU, the transition period as it were.
[03:05:18.825 --> 03:05:24.449]  They want to extend the transition period because they still think they can cancel it.
[03:05:24.449 --> 03:05:27.852]  After four years they still think they can cancel it.
[03:05:28.172 --> 03:05:40.586]  Just as you in the United States have had a four-year war on democracy with people trying to unseat Donald Trump, they've been trying to reverse the democratic will of the British people when it comes to Brexit for the past four years.
[03:05:40.586 --> 03:05:50.216]  Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has said that Remainers want the Prime Minister's advisor Dominic Cummings fired in order to have an excuse to extend the transition period.
[03:05:50.816 --> 03:06:03.286]  He said, it is clear that there are many, not all, but many in the Remain camp, particularly, who would like to see the back of him, who think Cummings going down may well aid them in getting us to extend beyond the end of this year.
[03:06:03.286 --> 03:06:05.548]  Now, you look at the polls.
[03:06:05.548 --> 03:06:12.473]  RT reports Boris Johnson's approval rating plummets by 20 points after refusing to sack Cummings for lockdown breaches.
[03:06:12.473 --> 03:06:14.455]  Again, it's all political.
[03:06:15.672 --> 03:06:19.196]  And then you can contrast it with this story up on Summit News.
[03:06:19.196 --> 03:06:34.771]  Now bear in mind I was just talking about Cummings' neighbours where he lives in North London, protesters who turned up outside his house where his wife and kids are with placards viciously, hatefully screaming at him every single day.
[03:06:36.795 --> 03:06:38.536]  Then we contrast it with this headline.
[03:06:38.536 --> 03:06:44.401]  Leftist Guardian writer tweets desire to physically attack Conservative MP in front of his children.
[03:06:44.401 --> 03:06:54.288]  A leftist podcaster who writes for The Guardian, which is of course the big left-wing newspaper in Britain, has tweeted his desire to physically attack a Conservative MP in front of his children.
[03:06:55.054 --> 03:06:58.056]  Yes, it's not enough to violently assault somebody.
[03:06:58.056 --> 03:06:59.977]  Their kids have to be watching.
[03:06:59.977 --> 03:07:02.118]  These are the tolerant people.
[03:07:02.118 --> 03:07:03.219]  These are the nice people.
[03:07:03.219 --> 03:07:04.519]  Hashtag be kind.
[03:07:04.519 --> 03:07:15.705]  These are the people who whine all day about bullying, harassment and hate when they prove time and time again to be the most hateful people on the planet.
[03:07:15.705 --> 03:07:16.526]  Andy Dawson
[03:07:17.546 --> 03:07:23.468]  So Michael Gove MP, again a Conservative Party MP, goes on the media this morning to defend Dominic Cummings.
[03:07:23.468 --> 03:07:29.230]  His wife tweets this in regard to the protests against Cummings outside his house.
[03:07:40.262 --> 03:07:49.772]  As someone who has been followed and insulted in the street in front of my own children, I would say that this is a classic example of what happens when a Twitter mob spills into real life.
[03:07:49.772 --> 03:07:52.154]  Terrifying and disproportionate.
[03:07:52.154 --> 03:08:00.122]  Because of course the Twitter cancellation mob outrage brigades don't just exist online, they now exist in real life.
[03:08:00.122 --> 03:08:02.405]  We saw another example, in fact multiple,
[03:08:03.436 --> 03:08:21.885]  With Rhys Mogg, another Conservative MP who again was confronted by these snarling leftist hate mobs outside his house in front of his children to the point where they were cussing at Rhys Mogg and his children, insulting their father as they almost cried in front of the media.
[03:08:21.885 --> 03:08:25.227]  The media had nothing much to say about that.
[03:08:25.227 --> 03:08:28.969]  So he responded to the wife of Michael Gove MP who was defending Cummings.
[03:08:30.578 --> 03:08:32.159]  And this is what he said.
[03:08:32.159 --> 03:08:36.801]  He's deleted his account now, by the way, because he couldn't face the backlash.
[03:08:36.801 --> 03:08:38.182]  He said, quote, Again,
[03:09:01.075 --> 03:09:03.276]  So much for the tolerant left.
[03:09:03.276 --> 03:09:13.300]  So this guy, who is a big leftist, was responding to the wife of a Conservative MP by saying, I want to beat you up in the street and I want your kids to watch it.
[03:09:13.300 --> 03:09:14.881]  Send tweet.
[03:09:14.881 --> 03:09:16.682]  He thought that was a good idea.
[03:09:16.682 --> 03:09:22.604]  Dawson locked down his Twitter account soon after he started receiving backlash for the tweet.
[03:09:22.604 --> 03:09:24.385]  Chris Tomlinson of Breitbart tweeted,
[03:09:25.327 --> 03:09:30.992]  Verified leftist Andy Dawson, a writer for The Guardian, The Daily Mirror, not only advocates for political violence, i.e.
[03:09:30.992 --> 03:09:35.495]  terrorism against a sitting cabinet minister, he's willing to finance it as well.
[03:09:35.495 --> 03:09:38.178]  Exactly what democracy is left in the UK.
[03:09:39.395 --> 03:09:55.829]  As I write in the article, it also highlights the two-tier system operated by social media giants like Twitter, which routinely bans Conservatives to their opinions, yet allows clear threats of violence, even against elected Members of Parliament, to go unpunished.
[03:09:56.790 --> 03:10:15.849]  As I spoke about a couple of weeks ago on this show, after Rand Paul went up against Dr Fauci in what was not even really a cantankerous confrontation, it was merely Rand Paul asking him a question and questioning why he should be the supreme authority on coronavirus.
[03:10:15.849 --> 03:10:16.970]  On Twitter within an hour,
[03:10:17.901 --> 03:10:24.144]  There were people saying, I'm hashtag RandPaul's Neighbour, they were talking about RandPaul's Neighbour, celebrating RandPaul's Neighbour.
[03:10:24.144 --> 03:10:33.309]  RandPaul's Neighbour violently attacked RandPaul from behind, leaving him having to have part of his lung removed.
[03:10:33.309 --> 03:10:38.191]  At one stage he was very, very seriously ill in hospital.
[03:10:38.191 --> 03:10:42.854]  They got on Twitter, they celebrated it from what I saw, nobody was banned for that.
[03:10:43.504 --> 03:10:58.730]  Within three hours of this leftist expressing his will to violently attack an elected member of parliament in front of his children, nothing whatsoever had happened to his verified Twitter account and he later deleted it himself.
[03:10:58.730 --> 03:11:00.311]  So that's what we're dealing with.
[03:11:00.311 --> 03:11:07.994]  Hateful, mob-outraged leftists, whipped up, ginned up by the hysterical fearmongers.
[03:11:07.994 --> 03:11:10.675]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:11:18.251 --> 03:11:22.594]  Now we're going to talk about a video which was uploaded to Twitter yesterday.
[03:11:35.658 --> 03:11:46.526]  ...and has received 30 million views in 24 hours on Twitter and is now being exploited to push yet more racial division in the United States.
[03:11:46.526 --> 03:11:50.269]  I notice that the hashtag Black Lives Matter is trending once again.
[03:11:50.269 --> 03:11:54.672]  That's partly in relation to this story and one other regarding police brutality.
[03:11:55.578 --> 03:12:05.781]  We're going to play this video here in a second, but there's a headline out of Sky News describing part of what happened, because as we'll see, the media doesn't have both sides of the story.
[03:12:05.781 --> 03:12:07.922]  Headline, Sky News.
[03:12:07.922 --> 03:12:13.044]  Woman sorry for calling police after black man asked her to put dog on leash.
[03:12:13.044 --> 03:12:18.965]  The woman in the video has denied being racist and says she humbly and fully apologizes for her actions.
[03:12:18.965 --> 03:12:20.386]  Video of a white woman
[03:12:21.263 --> 03:12:26.527]  Calling police after a row with a black man who asked her to put her dog on a leash has gone viral.
[03:12:26.527 --> 03:12:40.338]  When this clip was uploaded yesterday to Twitter, the headline was this, or the text accompanying the video, posted by the sister of the African-American man involved in the confrontation in Central Park, said this,
[03:12:51.664 --> 03:12:57.805]  And someone like my brother, an avid birder, politely asks her to put her dog on the leash.
[03:12:57.805 --> 03:13:16.950]  Now, from what you will see in this video, you will be in no doubt as to who is the villain of the piece, and it's clearly the mask-wearing Karen woman, who not only appears to be racist towards the African-American man, appears to basically try and get him swatted by the police, but also almost succeeds in strangling her own dog.
[03:13:17.645 --> 03:13:25.067]  And there's no doubt that she is indeed a villain, but as I'll get onto in a second, there are two villains involved in this script.
[03:13:25.067 --> 03:13:29.908]  Now let's go to the one-minute video of this confrontation in Central Park, New York.
[03:13:29.908 --> 03:13:34.128]  Here it is.
[03:13:34.128 --> 03:13:35.709]  Will you please stop?
[03:13:35.709 --> 03:13:37.329]  Sir, I'm asking you to stop.
[03:13:37.329 --> 03:13:38.929]  Please don't come close to me.
[03:13:38.929 --> 03:13:40.410]  Sir, I'm asking you to stop recording me.
[03:13:40.410 --> 03:13:41.530]  Please don't come close to me.
[03:13:41.530 --> 03:13:42.350]  Please take your phone off of me.
[03:13:42.350 --> 03:13:43.450]  Please don't come close to me.
[03:13:43.450 --> 03:13:44.771]  Can I take a picture of you calling the cops?
[03:13:44.771 --> 03:13:45.791]  Please, please call the cops.
[03:13:46.809 --> 03:13:48.350]  Please call the cops.
[03:13:48.350 --> 03:13:51.032]  I'm gonna tell them there's an African-American man threatening my life.
[03:13:51.032 --> 03:13:56.195]  Please tell them whatever you like!
[03:13:56.195 --> 03:14:04.840]  Excuse me?
[03:14:04.840 --> 03:14:13.585]  I'm sorry, I'm in a ramble and there is a man, African-American, he has a bicycle helmet, he's recording me and threatening me and my dog.
[03:14:16.397 --> 03:14:18.218]  There is an African American man.
[03:14:18.218 --> 03:14:19.478]  I am in Central Park.
[03:14:19.478 --> 03:14:24.500]  He is recording me and threatening myself and my dog.
[03:14:24.500 --> 03:14:29.262]  I'm sorry, I can't hear you either.
[03:14:29.262 --> 03:14:31.463]  I'm being threatened by a man in the Ramble.
[03:14:31.463 --> 03:14:35.164]  Please send the cops immediately.
[03:14:35.164 --> 03:14:36.985]  I'm in Central Park in the Ramble.
[03:14:36.985 --> 03:14:38.786]  I don't know.
[03:14:38.786 --> 03:14:39.166]  Thank you.
[03:14:42.560 --> 03:14:51.026]  So as you can see from that clip, and if you were just listening to that with the audio, by the end of the clip she's basically almost strangling her dog to death.
[03:14:51.026 --> 03:14:56.530]  She's since been put on administrative leave from her financial job and her dog has indeed been taken.
[03:14:56.530 --> 03:15:01.094]  And of course if you base your judgment on only what's in that clip,
[03:15:01.736 --> 03:15:21.436]  You will think that there's only one villain of the piece that she's calling the cops immediately on a whim because she's quote being threatened even though there's no evidence in the video of her being threatened and of course the fact that she said it's an African-American man has immediately been taken as proof that she's racist
[03:15:22.319 --> 03:15:37.924]  I was trying to get the police involved so they could violently tackle the African-American man because, of course, for the past month or so, we've had a resurgence of this narrative that African-American people are just being viciously attacked every time they step outside their house.
[03:15:37.924 --> 03:15:41.145]  In fact, I had this headline from 7th of May.
[03:15:41.145 --> 03:15:47.488]  LeBron James claims black people are, quote, hunted every time we step outside our homes.
[03:15:47.488 --> 03:15:50.308]  So that has been the narrative for the past month.
[03:15:50.308 --> 03:15:51.589]  But if you only saw the video,
[03:15:52.719 --> 03:15:55.841]  You could side with the person filming the video.
[03:15:55.841 --> 03:15:58.802]  It was his sister who later posted it to Twitter.
[03:15:58.802 --> 03:16:02.024]  And indeed, media reporting does exactly that.
[03:16:02.024 --> 03:16:09.508]  Continuing with the Sky News article, it says, A video of a white woman calling police after a row with a black man who asked her to put a dog on a leash has gone viral.
[03:16:09.508 --> 03:16:15.392]  Christian Cooper said he was birdwatching in a woodland area of New York's Central Park when the argument began.
[03:16:15.392 --> 03:16:21.515]  Mr. Cooper, a former Marvel Comics editor, filmed part of the altercation with the woman, who has now been suspended from her job.
[03:16:22.586 --> 03:16:24.828]  She tells him to stop recording.
[03:16:24.828 --> 03:16:36.357]  So the entire premise of the narrative is that the woman is lying by claiming the man threatened her when all he did was ask her to put her dog on a leash.
[03:16:36.357 --> 03:16:40.841]  So the narrative is this mask-wearing Karen has gone completely over the top.
[03:16:40.841 --> 03:16:41.641]  She's racist.
[03:16:41.641 --> 03:16:50.989]  She's putting the man's life at risk, describing him as African-American, presumably to make him sound more scary to the police because she's this horrible racist.
[03:16:52.665 --> 03:16:56.289]  30 million views on Twitter with that narrative.
[03:16:56.289 --> 03:17:04.216]  Turns out, the guy in the clip was threatening her, but you don't get to see that part of the interaction.
[03:17:04.216 --> 03:17:07.038]  And my source for that is the guy himself!
[03:17:07.038 --> 03:17:11.982]  Because he posted this to Facebook immediately after the incident.
[03:17:11.982 --> 03:17:15.926]  And this was tweeted by Jack Posobiec just a couple of hours ago.
[03:17:17.563 --> 03:17:29.306]  This is from the guy filming the video involved in the confrontation with the woman who again has cut off the part of it to make her look like a liar in claiming that he was threatening her when he wasn't.
[03:17:29.306 --> 03:17:32.607]  But this is what he said on Facebook.
[03:17:32.607 --> 03:17:34.287]  Christian Cooper.
[03:17:34.287 --> 03:17:35.907]  Central Park this morning.
[03:17:35.907 --> 03:17:38.828]  This woman's dog is tearing through the plantings in the Ramble.
[03:17:39.582 --> 03:17:40.402]  Me.
[03:17:40.402 --> 03:17:43.243]  Ma'am, dogs in the Ramble have to be on the leash at all times.
[03:17:43.243 --> 03:17:44.843]  The sign is right there.
[03:17:44.843 --> 03:17:45.723]  Her.
[03:17:45.723 --> 03:17:46.884]  The dog runs are closed.
[03:17:46.884 --> 03:17:48.244]  He needs his exercise.
[03:17:48.244 --> 03:17:49.344]  Me.
[03:17:49.344 --> 03:17:55.125]  All you have to do is take him to the other side of the drive, outside the Ramble, and you can let him run off leash all you want.
[03:17:55.125 --> 03:17:55.545]  Her.
[03:17:55.545 --> 03:17:56.486]  It's too dangerous.
[03:17:56.486 --> 03:17:57.366]  Me.
[03:17:57.366 --> 03:18:05.608]  Look, if you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.
[03:18:05.608 --> 03:18:06.408]  Her.
[03:18:06.408 --> 03:18:06.928]  What's that?
[03:18:07.754 --> 03:18:10.936]  Me, to the dog, come here puppy!
[03:18:10.936 --> 03:18:12.777]  Her, he won't come to you.
[03:18:12.777 --> 03:18:15.178]  Me, we'll see about that.
[03:18:15.178 --> 03:18:18.620]  I pull out the dog treats I carry for just such intransigence.
[03:18:18.620 --> 03:18:23.823]  I didn't even get a chance to toss any treats to the pooch before Karen scrambled to grab the dog.
[03:18:23.823 --> 03:18:25.624]  Her, don't you touch my dog.
[03:18:25.624 --> 03:18:28.786]  That's when I started recording the video.
[03:18:28.786 --> 03:18:34.129]  So again, before the recording began, this guy said to the woman,
[03:18:34.875 --> 03:18:41.417]  If you're going to do what you want, I'm going to do what I want, but you're not going to like it.
[03:18:41.417 --> 03:18:43.738]  And then he calls over the dog.
[03:18:43.738 --> 03:18:50.940]  Now, to any reasonable person, that is an implicit threat of harm to the woman's dog.
[03:18:50.940 --> 03:18:54.701]  Whether he was actually going to do anything to the dog, nobody knows.
[03:18:54.701 --> 03:18:56.902]  But that is a threat towards the woman's dog.
[03:18:56.902 --> 03:18:59.863]  If somebody came up to your dog and started threatening to do something to it,
[03:19:00.771 --> 03:19:03.393]  You probably wouldn't have the best reaction either.
[03:19:03.393 --> 03:19:08.235]  So both individuals in this clip are Karens.
[03:19:08.235 --> 03:19:17.000]  This mask-wearing woman who's freaking out, strangling her own dog, calling the police on the guy, trying to escalate the confrontation immediately.
[03:19:17.000 --> 03:19:25.505]  She's bad and so is the guy for leaving out the recording or misrepresenting what happened by leaving out the recording
[03:19:26.201 --> 03:19:28.342]  before he uploaded it to Twitter.
[03:19:28.342 --> 03:19:38.308]  He should have described what happened in the text of the video on Twitter, but he didn't, and that completely changed the narrative of the story.
[03:19:38.308 --> 03:19:52.437]  Of course, people have pointed out in the aftermath, last week we had an African-American male viciously beating an elderly white man and viciously beating an elderly woman in a care home in Detroit
[03:19:53.078 --> 03:20:13.572]  And it got basically 2% of the media coverage that this story out of New York is getting today, despite the fact that if you watch the video, we highlighted it on the show last week, of the African American male beating the elderly white people, it was even more disturbing than that confrontation in Central Park.
[03:20:14.258 --> 03:20:18.159]  That didn't get 30 million views, the Central Park video did.
[03:20:18.159 --> 03:20:29.361]  That didn't get 2% of the media coverage that the Central Park incident is getting today, trending all over Twitter, even though it's been completely misrepresented.
[03:20:29.361 --> 03:20:41.663]  So yeah, another media hoax ginned up by hysteria as an exploitative move to again cause race divisions in the United States in the aftermath of, of course, the killing
[03:20:42.737 --> 03:20:44.978]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:21:16.306 --> 03:21:25.828]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:21:25.828 --> 03:21:40.812]  We'll get back into some big final news stories here in a second but of course with many media outlets going completely bust this week and last week serves as a reminder that your great support continues to allow us to thrive and build here

[03:22:45.110 --> 03:22:54.318]  Now, we had the mask Karen in the previous segment with the incident in Central Park, which turned out to be a tale of two Karens, but the media's not going to tell you that.
[03:22:54.318 --> 03:22:56.260]  We had this story yesterday.
[03:22:56.260 --> 03:22:56.980]  Video.
[03:22:56.980 --> 03:23:01.444]  Woman driven out of grocery store by angry mob for not wearing a mask.
[03:23:01.444 --> 03:23:05.508]  Yes, the high priest class of mask wearers strikes again.
[03:23:06.437 --> 03:23:12.565]  Video footage out of Staten Island shows a woman being driven out of a grocery store by an angry mob because she's not wearing a mask.
[03:23:12.565 --> 03:23:16.730]  The clip shows the woman surrounded by the shoppers as they yell and cuss at her.
[03:23:16.730 --> 03:23:17.851]  Get the F out of here!
[03:23:17.851 --> 03:23:18.272]  Get out!
[03:23:18.272 --> 03:23:21.856]  The crowd screams at the woman while pointing towards the exit.
[03:23:21.856 --> 03:23:23.198]  And if you read the comments...
[03:23:24.093 --> 03:23:29.795]  Below this video on Twitter, most of them supported the angry mob.
[03:23:29.795 --> 03:23:41.439]  So once again, this mask, which at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic they said, don't wear a mask because it doesn't do anything and you're depriving doctors and nurses of PPE.
[03:23:41.439 --> 03:23:45.161]  So people who wear masks are bad, they're evil.
[03:23:45.161 --> 03:23:51.683]  Now they're saying if you don't wear a mask, that means you're evil because you're not a good little obedient slave.
[03:23:52.412 --> 03:23:59.655]  So now they're literally hounding people out of grocery stores in New York, having formed into giant mobs.
[03:23:59.655 --> 03:24:04.076]  Maybe they should ask to be paid for it, because that's what's about to happen in Italy.
[03:24:04.076 --> 03:24:10.358]  Headline, Italian government wants unemployed to become social distancing snitches.
[03:24:10.358 --> 03:24:14.840]  The Italian government announced intentions Sunday to create an army of social distancing snitches.
[03:24:15.498 --> 03:24:24.925]  Saying it will recruit 60,000 Karens to monitor their friends' and neighbours' activities and make sure they are adhering to social distancing policies.
[03:24:24.925 --> 03:24:30.969]  Reports indicate the government will reach out especially to the unemployed for the roles, in particular those who have applied for benefits recently.
[03:24:32.088 --> 03:24:49.422]  So again, just as in the United States, mass unemployment caused by the lockdown, then they fill in the gaps by creating tens of thousands of Stasi-like spies for the state, who will snitch on you, who will grass you up if you don't properly engage in social distancing.
[03:24:49.422 --> 03:24:58.310]  Which of course, if you look at many of the studies, proves that the lockdown, that social distancing, didn't really have an effect on coronavirus deaths.
[03:24:58.310 --> 03:25:00.892]  But that doesn't matter because this is very lucrative,
[03:25:01.676 --> 03:25:02.856]  The Big Brother.
[03:25:02.856 --> 03:25:11.519]  It wants people to become civic assistants who will report infractions on the use of face masks and other state-ordered rules in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown.
[03:25:11.519 --> 03:25:19.101]  Informants will not be given uniforms or badges and will simply be embedded within the population, meaning anyone could be a government snitch.
[03:25:19.101 --> 03:25:24.982]  Just like in East Germany, it could be your friend, it could be your neighbour.
[03:25:24.982 --> 03:25:30.404]  Meanwhile, IKEA to employ social distancing wardens to patrol shoppers.
[03:25:30.404 --> 03:25:31.124]  This is in the UK.
[03:25:32.248 --> 03:25:39.392]  Ikea is set to employ social distance wardens who tell people how to behave in stores as a whole new jobs market for Karens is created.
[03:25:39.392 --> 03:25:45.615]  The Swedish furniture giant announced today that it would open 19 of its stores across the UK on June 1st.
[03:25:45.615 --> 03:25:50.317]  However, families hoping to make a day of visiting the store can forget about it.
[03:25:50.317 --> 03:25:53.739]  Only one adult and one child per household is allowed.
[03:25:53.739 --> 03:25:59.962]  So again, they're exploiting these stupid social distancing rules to ensure families can't have days out.
[03:26:00.720 --> 03:26:10.328]  Then it says, other measures to ensure safer trading during the coronavirus outbreak include social distance wardens to help shoppers navigate a new one-way system.
[03:26:10.328 --> 03:26:20.436]  So again, get ready for ethnic minority minimum wage slaves imported as cheap labour to bark orders at you and your family as you shop.
[03:26:20.436 --> 03:26:21.397]  Can't wait!
[03:26:23.624 --> 03:26:29.867]  Meanwhile, psychiatrists wrote 86% more prescriptions for psychotropic drugs during lockdown months.
[03:26:29.867 --> 03:26:37.572]  Again, this gets to the heart of this massive mental health problem that we won't feel the full effects for for years to come.
[03:26:37.572 --> 03:26:47.417]  Psychiatrists wrote 86% more prescriptions for psychotropic drugs, including antidepressants, during the lockdown months of March and April compared to January and February.
[03:26:48.553 --> 03:26:56.580]  Prescriptions for anti-anxiety medications and sleep aids have risen during the pandemic, reports the Wall Street Journal.
[03:26:56.580 --> 03:27:15.215]  So, big hike in prescriptions of antidepressants, which of course have a number of side effects which aren't necessarily great, but again it illustrates how this has been terrible for people's mental health and on that very subject, California hospital records more suicides than coronavirus deaths during lockdown.
[03:27:16.303 --> 03:27:21.266]  This is John Muir Medical Centre in Walnut Creek, California.
[03:27:21.266 --> 03:27:30.050]  Doctors say they've recorded more deaths from suicide than coronavirus, with a year's worth of suicides and suicide attempts being recorded in a four-week period.
[03:27:30.050 --> 03:27:42.717]  All the nurses and doctors at this hospital are trying to blow the whistle, calling for the lockdown to be fully lifted, because more people have died from suicide than coronavirus itself.
[03:27:42.717 --> 03:27:43.577]  And related to that,
[03:27:44.861 --> 03:27:49.162]  There's another headline here which I just put up on Summit News a couple of hours ago.
[03:27:49.162 --> 03:27:54.644]  Study lockdown will destroy at least seven times more years of human life than it saves.
[03:27:54.644 --> 03:28:04.927]  Once again, the lockdown claiming more lives than all the social distancing, the coronavirus, the social distancing causing more deaths than the coronavirus itself.
[03:28:04.927 --> 03:28:06.447]  Then what was the point?
[03:28:07.273 --> 03:28:20.001]  A study has found that the stay-at-home lockdown order in the United States will, quote, destroy at least seven times more years of human life than it saves, and that this number is likely to be more than 90 times greater.
[03:28:20.001 --> 03:28:20.401]  Why?
[03:28:20.401 --> 03:28:27.345]  Well, because of debilitating stress, anxiety, job losses, untreated illnesses.
[03:28:27.345 --> 03:28:29.106]  Remember, I've talked about this many times.
[03:28:29.844 --> 03:28:37.007]  The Professor of Cancer at King's College is predicting at least 50,000 cancer deaths in the UK.
[03:28:37.007 --> 03:28:42.529]  Cancer deaths alone, excess cancer deaths, because people were unable to get treatment.
[03:28:42.529 --> 03:28:47.211]  That's more deaths than people have died from coronavirus in the UK so far.
[03:28:47.211 --> 03:28:48.392]  That's not even including
[03:28:49.355 --> 03:29:02.418]  The 1.4 million global tuberculosis deaths that experts say are now going to happen again because people couldn't get treatment, because the hospitals were all devoted to coronavirus.
[03:29:02.418 --> 03:29:10.619]  We couldn't overwhelm the hospitals while all the nurses were dancing on TikTok, because that's very important.
[03:29:10.619 --> 03:29:15.340]  Meanwhile in Sweden, we talked about this last week, there's been a development
[03:29:16.229 --> 03:29:23.055]  Father of Swedish man killed by migrant, forced by media to defend his dead son from Nazi smears.
[03:29:23.055 --> 03:29:31.882]  So we had the initial story, which was a Swedish man who was killed by a Sudanese migrant while trying to prevent a woman being raped.
[03:29:31.882 --> 03:29:35.425]  And now his father is being harassed by the media.
[03:29:35.425 --> 03:29:43.131]  They're not asking questions about why Sweden has a massive problem with violent crime, why Sweden has a massive problem with rape.
[03:29:43.829 --> 03:29:52.676]  No, they're going to the house of the father of the victim who was murdered by the migrant to ask him, was your son a Nazi?
[03:29:52.676 --> 03:30:03.004]  As we previously highlighted, Tommy Lind was stabbed to death while trying to stop the assault after a group of migrants crashed a house party in Hornos and uninvited.
[03:30:03.004 --> 03:30:06.687]  After killing Lind, the migrant continued to rape the woman.
[03:30:06.687 --> 03:30:10.130]  He was later named as 22-year-old Abu Bakr Mohammed,
[03:30:10.777 --> 03:30:21.480]  A Sudanese migrant who was granted Swedish citizenship in 2011 and had a long criminal record, including a 2015 conviction of raping a girl under the age of 15.
[03:30:21.480 --> 03:30:28.502]  Why on earth was he out on the streets when he'd been convicted of raping a girl less than five years ago?
[03:30:28.502 --> 03:30:37.545]  Following the murder, a right-wing group staged a protest in Hornos and, of course, the media was more outraged about that, how dare they, against the killing.
[03:30:38.601 --> 03:30:42.243]  But the demonstrators were immediately smeared as Nazis by the media.
[03:30:42.243 --> 03:30:44.205]  But that wasn't enough.
[03:30:44.205 --> 03:31:03.157]  Swedish public broadcaster SVT, which dutifully amplified the Nazi narrative, then paid a visit to the home of Lynne's father after he'd been stabbed to death by a migrant for trying to stop a woman being raped, where his father was forced to defend his dead son against accusations he was racist.
[03:31:03.157 --> 03:31:06.859]  As the article makes clear, the father was grilled about why his son had a shaved head.
[03:31:07.614 --> 03:31:15.900]  As he insisted, Lynn was not a Nazi, but may have had friends who sympathised with the Nordic resistance movement, the group that staged the protest.
[03:31:15.900 --> 03:31:26.106]  So they were more interested in the victim's political leanings than reporting on the fact that he was killed by a migrant while trying to stop a woman being raped.
[03:31:26.106 --> 03:31:26.987]  Is it any surprise
[03:31:27.702 --> 03:31:45.467]  That parties like the one Lind the victim supported, Alternative for Sweden, and Sweden Democrats, which is the other populist party, are doing better and better in Sweden, which of course has become notorious for its rampant problems with violent crime as a result of mass immigration.
[03:31:45.467 --> 03:31:46.087]  Gonna wrap it up.
[03:31:46.087 --> 03:31:48.108]  Coming up, War Room with Owen Troyer.
[03:31:48.108 --> 03:31:48.948]  Infowars.com.
[03:31:48.948 --> 03:31:49.408]  Don't go away.
