[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:08.557]  But Michael, plastic rubber snake in the pants, Obama, says, hey, you vote for us or things will get a lot worse, you understand?
[00:00:09.177 --> 00:00:11.840]  That is a serious gangster threat from Big Mike.
[00:00:13.421 --> 00:00:14.262]  And it's more than that.
[00:00:15.785 --> 00:00:21.332]  It's a guarantee because they've said, oh, even if Trump loses, we're going to level the Midwest.
[00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:22.914]  We're going to level the South.
[00:00:23.254 --> 00:00:25.377]  We're going to level red country.
[00:00:25.417 --> 00:00:27.219]  We're going to cut off your economy.
[00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:29.382]  We're going to bring you to heel.
[00:00:30.316 --> 00:00:31.477]  We're going to break your will.
[00:00:31.737 --> 00:00:32.758]  We're going to make you pay.
[00:00:33.078 --> 00:00:50.950]  Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is going to drag out and eventually I do believe he will win if we don't give an inch and if we are as focused and relentless as the other side is.
[00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.791]  They're going to contest the election.
[00:00:54.906 --> 00:01:00.230]  They know they're going to lose and that they're going to try to have secession and break up the country.
[00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:04.773]  The full report is at Banned.Video where I show all the Pelosi quotes and other quotes.
[00:01:05.514 --> 00:01:14.721]  It's very, very important because they know that all the major projections now coming out show Trump winning 322 delegates versus a Democrat 210.
[00:01:19.977 --> 00:01:22.939]  And they are very, very scared and very, very upset.
[00:01:23.379 --> 00:01:28.523]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:32.062 --> 00:01:39.868]  Hillary Clinton came out yesterday on Politico in a video, in an interview, and said, we're going to contest the election no matter what and break the country up.
[00:01:40.588 --> 00:01:41.729]  It's now official.
[00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:52.477]  In Podesta war games, in Nancy Pelosi announcements, in Hillary Clinton announcements, this is open declaration of war against the republic.
[00:01:53.373 --> 00:01:54.956]  They're saying contest, no matter what.
[00:01:54.976 --> 00:01:55.797]  They know they're going to lose.
[00:01:55.837 --> 00:01:57.019]  The numbers are in right now.
[00:01:57.159 --> 00:01:58.482]  Landslide for Trump.
[00:01:58.502 --> 00:01:59.764]  We're going to be breaking it all down.
[00:02:00.425 --> 00:02:05.273]  But first, two key pieces of intel you need to see.
[00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:07.751]  The year is 2020.
[00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:28.019]  Following several decades of systematically weakening the social, moral, and financial resilience of the American people, the global cabal has launched a series of unimaginable terrors that have rocked the foundation of Western civilization and has fractured the population of a once united country along increasingly irreconcilable lines.
[00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:39.143]  The nation finds herself on the precipice of all-out civil war, diving headlong towards economic ruin, and already suffocating under the dictatorship of biotechnocratic enslavement.
[00:02:40.343 --> 00:02:44.065]  The final takedown order has been issued, the direct attack has begun.
[00:02:45.262 --> 00:02:49.324]  America's greatest trial, and the battle for her survival, is underway.
[00:02:50.084 --> 00:02:55.586]  InfoWars Emergency Transmissions are now broadcasting live weeknights 7 to 9 p.m.
[00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:56.867]  Central Standard Time.
[00:02:57.167 --> 00:02:58.308]  Election Countdown.
[00:02:58.608 --> 00:03:02.589]  Taking America back on Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.971]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:03:16.883 --> 00:03:18.525]  Understand what's going on around you.
[00:03:19.025 --> 00:03:20.466]  You are in a state of war.
[00:03:21.407 --> 00:03:24.669]  And you have precious little time to save yourself.
[00:03:29.512 --> 00:03:45.824]  It's a slow process which we call active measures.
[00:03:47.725 --> 00:03:49.825]  The first stage being demoralization.
[00:03:49.845 --> 00:03:54.166]  It takes from 15 to 20 years to demoralize a nation.
[00:03:55.686 --> 00:03:57.567]  The next stage is destabilization.
[00:03:58.807 --> 00:04:00.187]  What matters is essentials.
[00:04:00.747 --> 00:04:05.488]  Economy, foreign relations, defense systems.
[00:04:05.968 --> 00:04:13.110]  The next stage is crisis, with a violent change of power, structure, and economy.
[00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.510]  Period of normalization.
[00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:23.835]  This is what will happen in the United States if you allow all these schmucks to put a big rubber government in Washington, D.C.
[00:04:24.155 --> 00:04:28.659]  We will promise lots of things, never mind whether the promises are fulfilled or not.
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.781]  The time bomb is ticking.
[00:04:53.782 --> 00:04:57.724]  But every second, the disaster is coming closer and closer.
[00:04:58.985 --> 00:05:00.306]  The danger is real.
[00:05:03.468 --> 00:05:05.530]  And that's a warning from the late 1980s.
[00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:14.656]  Now, here we are, with the same internationalist group that was successful in taking over Russia and China, now trying to bring us down, working with China.
[00:05:15.656 --> 00:05:19.159]  The last part that he doesn't mention there is the exploitation phase.
[00:05:20.296 --> 00:05:31.346]  Once they demoralize, destabilize, and then normalize and have control, then they launch exploitation of that nation to take over other countries.
[00:05:32.648 --> 00:05:37.892]  So that's why I always explain that when we get into the fact that the globalists use Russia to attack the United States.
[00:05:38.868 --> 00:05:41.168]  So the globalists use the United States to attack Ukraine.
[00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:43.909]  Or the globalists use China to attack the United States.
[00:05:44.469 --> 00:05:46.250]  It's the cabal doing it, and they brag about it.
[00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:49.930]  It's all very public at the Council on Foreign Relations level.
[00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:57.392]  These are enemies of all of humanity, whether you're Russian, Chinese, or from the United States, whether you're Mexican, or whether you're from Timbuktu.
[00:05:57.932 --> 00:06:01.873]  They are the enemy, and they don't want to be spotlighted, but we're doing it.
[00:06:01.893 --> 00:06:05.213]  68 short days.
[00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:05.914]  68 short days.
[00:06:08.894 --> 00:06:14.803]  I come to you on this live August 26th, Wednesday, Global Transmission.
[00:06:15.504 --> 00:06:16.305]  The year is 2020.
[00:06:16.505 --> 00:06:19.409]  And again, I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:06:21.328 --> 00:06:23.429]  Well, in a few minutes we'll play you the clip.
[00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:37.778]  Hillary Clinton has come out openly in a Politico interview yesterday, and the video's linked up on newswars.com and infowars.com, and said Biden should not concede under any circumstances.
[00:06:37.859 --> 00:06:38.599]  That's a quote.
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.682]  Well, we happen to have the electoral
[00:06:43.826 --> 00:06:49.791]  Map right here for TV viewers, and this is a map being put up by one of the polling firms.
[00:06:49.811 --> 00:06:54.415]  There's a whole bunch of maps that basically are put up by different groups projecting the same numbers.
[00:06:54.475 --> 00:06:56.036]  I can tell you the Democrats have similar numbers.
[00:06:56.397 --> 00:06:57.798]  The Republicans have similar numbers.
[00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:03.243]  With Trump set to win with projections 322 of the delegates and the Democrats 210.
[00:07:10.603 --> 00:07:15.964]  And the way things are going, Trump's numbers internally are going up and up and up, Democrat numbers are going down and down and down.
[00:07:16.684 --> 00:07:19.565]  Their gamble to demoralize and collapse the country is failing.
[00:07:20.025 --> 00:07:28.107]  That does not mean with 68 long days, it's a long time and a short time, it's rushing towards us, that they aren't going to try to implode the dollar.
[00:07:28.227 --> 00:07:34.968]  They're doing that around the clock, start new wars, have China start a war, release a new, more deadly virus to shut things down.
[00:07:35.008 --> 00:07:38.769]  We were only primed for submission with the last eight months of lockdown.
[00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:43.842]  The Communist Chinese have threatened to attack U.S.
[00:07:43.902 --> 00:08:00.736]  ships in the South China Sea, and they fired two missiles very close to our ships in quote, warning to the U.S., close quote, in huge escalation following spy plane breach, they claim, of a U-2 spy plane over an area that China has now claimed control of the airspace as well.
[00:08:01.837 --> 00:08:04.459]  So we are in very serious times.
[00:08:04.499 --> 00:08:05.920]  America is fighting for its life.
[00:08:06.806 --> 00:08:27.676]  And you've got all of these people who either honor welfare or work two or three jobs and go to community college, and they're being told by Bernie Sanders and others, especially in places like Oregon and Washington State and Wisconsin and New York, that you're going to get everything free.
[00:08:27.876 --> 00:08:33.579]  Housing, cars, education, living wage, you don't have to work, guaranteed fixed income.
[00:08:35.214 --> 00:08:39.417]  And they're told, go out and burn things down and you are a communist revolutionary, you will get it.
[00:08:40.278 --> 00:08:45.862]  We have the Project Veritas undercover videos all over the country, but I can just tune into what they're saying and tell you that.
[00:08:46.903 --> 00:08:52.728]  Because that is the belief system, that is the worldview that they've been given.
[00:08:52.968 --> 00:08:56.070]  So, these are very, very unhappy people.
[00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.131]  Most of them are on drugs.
[00:08:57.191 --> 00:09:04.497]  Most of them have never had a job in their life, but they are organizers at the community colleges talking about how they're going to burn everything down, how they're going to shoot everybody.
[00:09:05.478 --> 00:09:05.678]  I don't
[00:09:25.799 --> 00:09:27.940]  Who serve the system and only want money and power.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.820]  And so they're not going to really want to be president.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:41.163]  They're just going to want to be placeholders for whoever they decide to install after Joe Biden steps down and Kamala Harris steps into the position of president or stays vice president.
[00:09:42.684 --> 00:09:43.984]  And Pelosi has said this.
[00:09:44.004 --> 00:09:44.804]  They've all said this.
[00:09:44.824 --> 00:09:48.025]  They're now saying Joe Biden will just step down on CNN.
[00:09:48.085 --> 00:09:48.625]  Don't worry.
[00:09:49.065 --> 00:09:49.345]  Okay.
[00:09:49.365 --> 00:09:50.606]  He's got cognitive decline.
[00:09:50.966 --> 00:09:51.626]  He's our guy.
[00:09:57.537 --> 00:10:01.399]  This is how the communists basically put people in power.
[00:10:02.359 --> 00:10:16.424]  And they like to have, a lot of times, a weak person up front when they first get power, so they can then reshuffle things, blame the mass murder and things that take place during the takeover on the last group, purge their own people, and then move in for full control.
[00:10:17.225 --> 00:10:20.606]  And why do the globalists follow the same roadmap over and over again, the same playbook?
[00:10:20.946 --> 00:10:25.108]  Because it's worked for them over and over and over again, and they're running it yet again.
[00:10:26.812 --> 00:10:37.881]  Earth-shaking events to have Hillary Clinton come out and openly tell the world that they are going to contest.
[00:10:38.302 --> 00:10:55.376]  That's why they put out 80 million plus ballots with the wrong names, the wrong houses, sometimes completely blank, so that it gums up everything, like pouring sugar in a gas tank, and then when Trump tries to fix it, they can say, look, you're blocking the election.
[00:10:56.559 --> 00:10:58.361]  Oh look, you sabotaged the post office.
[00:10:58.701 --> 00:11:01.623]  You didn't give them the $25 million that they don't even need.
[00:11:03.425 --> 00:11:05.106]  Now you can see all this being set up.
[00:11:05.146 --> 00:11:06.508]  You can see it all being prepared.
[00:11:06.828 --> 00:11:10.231]  Trump talked about it on Monday, being set up, how it's all being prepared.
[00:11:10.591 --> 00:11:20.640]  But now she's telling her troops 69 days out, yesterday, 68 today, that they're going to do this and that this is legitimate.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:33.290]  And the so-called journalists that are interviewing her are thrusting their fist into the air in vitriolic excitement and fervor and enthusiasm.
[00:11:34.792 --> 00:11:43.980]  And so you've got all these bureaucrats and all these government operatives and all these corrupt corporate operatives that want to gut this country and sell it off to the highest bidder.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:45.320]  I think?
[00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:14.514]  Plastic rubber snake in the pants, Obama, says, hey, you vote for us or things will get a lot worse, you understand?
[00:12:15.134 --> 00:12:17.796]  That is a serious gangster threat from Big Mike.
[00:12:19.377 --> 00:12:20.258]  And it's more than that.
[00:12:21.758 --> 00:12:27.282]  It's a guarantee because they've said, oh, even if Trump loses, we're going to level the Midwest.
[00:12:27.562 --> 00:12:28.883]  We're going to level the South.
[00:12:29.223 --> 00:12:31.324]  We're going to level red country.
[00:12:31.364 --> 00:12:33.165]  We're going to cut off your economy.
[00:12:34.046 --> 00:12:35.327]  We're going to bring you to heel.
[00:12:36.288 --> 00:12:37.429]  We're gonna break your will.
[00:12:37.689 --> 00:12:38.710]  We're gonna make you pay.
[00:12:38.730 --> 00:12:42.473]  Here's what Hillary Clinton had to say yesterday.
[00:12:42.493 --> 00:13:01.668]  You know, Joe Biden should not concede under any circumstances because I think this is gonna drag out and eventually I do believe he will win if we don't give an inch and if we are as focused and relentless as the other side is.
[00:13:04.107 --> 00:13:06.108]  Gotta love Hillary every time she's on Skype.
[00:13:06.148 --> 00:13:07.529]  She can't help but look at herself.
[00:13:10.091 --> 00:13:11.092]  Talk about a narcissist.
[00:13:11.352 --> 00:13:12.193]  Talk about a psycho.
[00:13:12.213 --> 00:13:15.535]  It's always a sign of a real amateur.
[00:13:15.555 --> 00:13:16.936]  This one there.
[00:13:17.857 --> 00:13:21.940]  She's looking at the camera there, but the rest of the time she's looking down at the little Skype window of herself there.
[00:13:23.181 --> 00:13:25.382]  But look at the evil in that woman's eyes.
[00:13:25.422 --> 00:13:29.445]  She's been serving the pedophile network since she was a little girl.
[00:13:29.505 --> 00:13:31.327]  Her dad was the number two gangster in Chicago.
[00:13:32.674 --> 00:13:39.056]  Her first job out of college was to cover up for child rapist gangs in Arkansas for rich men.
[00:13:40.036 --> 00:13:43.077]  I mean, she is just the worst person you could ever imagine.
[00:13:44.697 --> 00:13:51.859]  But she knew she had to go bathe in the pedophilia to show all the big boys that she was in the crew.
[00:13:53.399 --> 00:13:55.080]  What a horrible, demonic person.
[00:13:55.100 --> 00:14:00.741]  And she has this whole leftist mob that believes she would be president and give them all jobs and make them powerful.
[00:14:02.298 --> 00:14:06.259]  And they are just bowing to her, and there's a whole cult around her.
[00:14:06.419 --> 00:14:09.260]  And to watch her cult fail and fall is a beautiful thing.
[00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:16.402]  And they know that if Trump gets re-elected, he will start really removing the swamp.
[00:14:17.242 --> 00:14:20.203]  He'll definitely remove their power structure at the bottom of the swamp.
[00:14:20.963 --> 00:14:25.204]  And they know that they are facing total political, cultural destruction.
[00:14:25.744 --> 00:14:27.785]  Because there's no honor amongst thieves.
[00:14:27.805 --> 00:14:29.065]  Look at Harvey Weinstein.
[00:14:30.657 --> 00:14:31.738]  Look at Jeffrey Epstein.
[00:14:32.799 --> 00:14:47.350]  As soon as their money runs out, or as soon as one person stands up against them, everybody starts standing up, and the house of cards falls, and it's a big house of cards, and the wind of change is here, and the house of cards is already falling in slow motion.
[00:14:48.011 --> 00:14:49.732]  So they know it's going down.
[00:14:50.513 --> 00:14:51.694]  They know that they're in trouble.
[00:14:52.775 --> 00:14:59.060]  They know they're on borrowed time, so they're busy stealing as much money as they can, buying armored fortresses in faraway countries,
[00:15:00.270 --> 00:15:00.570]  I think so.
[00:15:22.976 --> 00:15:32.168]  Openly saying they're going to contest the election, have a bunch of states secede, and declare Biden and Kamala Harris the winners, and then dare federal troops to come in.
[00:15:32.188 --> 00:15:33.590]  I mean, why shouldn't they?
[00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.132]  They haven't gotten in trouble for what they've done yet.
[00:15:36.173 --> 00:15:39.538]  That's why I've called for executive action and direct action by the President.
[00:15:41.867 --> 00:15:43.768]  That's right.
[00:15:43.928 --> 00:15:50.171]  It looks like, again, scenes out of a third world collapse or civil war.
[00:15:50.771 --> 00:15:54.313]  Road Warrior isn't even strong enough to describe it.
[00:15:54.673 --> 00:15:57.894]  Police being stopped by Black Lives Matter communist checkpoints.
[00:15:58.755 --> 00:16:00.255]  Warehouses being burned down.
[00:16:00.335 --> 00:16:01.596]  Car dealerships burned down.
[00:16:01.996 --> 00:16:03.076]  Churches burned down.
[00:16:03.777 --> 00:16:04.937]  Street battles everywhere.
[00:16:05.037 --> 00:16:09.039]  People running up, hitting police in the back of the head with bricks.
[00:16:13.257 --> 00:16:22.764]  Americans of all races joining together to declare in the face of injustice and brutality at the hands of the state.
[00:16:23.285 --> 00:16:25.807]  This poor man got his business caught on fire.
[00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:29.670]  I'm sorry, sir.
[00:16:30.370 --> 00:16:31.731]  I'm very sorry about that, man.
[00:16:31.931 --> 00:16:33.132]  Yeah, really.
[00:16:33.212 --> 00:16:34.694]  Hey, I had nothing to do with that.
[00:16:35.054 --> 00:16:36.415]  They just threw a bottle at this guy.
[00:16:45.204 --> 00:16:45.545]  Hey!
[00:16:45.785 --> 00:16:46.205]  Hey!
[00:16:46.465 --> 00:16:46.845]  Hey!
[00:16:47.146 --> 00:16:47.426]  No!
[00:16:47.806 --> 00:16:48.406]  No!
[00:16:48.787 --> 00:16:49.707]  No!
[00:16:51.108 --> 00:16:52.049]  Black Lives Matter.
[00:16:53.730 --> 00:16:55.311]  No more, but no less.
[00:16:55.671 --> 00:16:56.671]  His neck is not broken.
[00:17:10.691 --> 00:17:14.213]  To that no child in this country feels the continuing sting of racism.
[00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:18.516]  That's somebody else's hat!
[00:17:18.576 --> 00:17:19.596]  Get your hat back, baby.
[00:17:19.656 --> 00:17:22.098]  Look at what you just did to my son.
[00:17:22.118 --> 00:17:23.018]  Get your hat back, baby.
[00:17:23.058 --> 00:17:24.079]  Get your hat back, baby.
[00:17:24.659 --> 00:17:29.262]  To the young people who led us this summer, telling us we need to be better.
[00:17:29.922 --> 00:17:34.345]  In so many ways, you are this country's dreams fulfilled.
[00:17:42.594 --> 00:17:47.179]  Earlier generations had to be persuaded that everyone has equal worth.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:48.921]  For you, it's a given.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:50.741]  A conviction!
[00:17:50.761 --> 00:17:52.322]  This is wrong guys!
[00:17:52.462 --> 00:17:53.403]  Do you not see this?
[00:17:53.743 --> 00:17:54.404]  This is wrong!
[00:17:54.624 --> 00:17:59.048]  This is what's going to happen to every one of you when this project goes nationwide!
[00:17:59.488 --> 00:18:00.749]  I don't think you realize this!
[00:18:01.370 --> 00:18:02.170]  Please guys!
[00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.093]  We're trying to protect ourselves!
[00:18:06.033 --> 00:18:08.375]  This is how communists overthrow your country.
[00:18:09.056 --> 00:18:12.038]  Ideological subversion is the slow process
[00:18:12.899 --> 00:18:19.222]  Which we call either ideological subversion or active measures or psychological warfare.
[00:18:19.322 --> 00:18:21.804]  We are scared as black people in America.
[00:18:21.944 --> 00:18:24.945]  Black men, black women, black kids.
[00:18:26.186 --> 00:18:28.727]  We are terrified because you don't know.
[00:18:29.467 --> 00:18:30.408]  You have no idea.
[00:18:31.188 --> 00:18:32.089]  You have no idea.
[00:18:33.465 --> 00:18:35.926]  How did it come that they left the house?
[00:18:36.647 --> 00:18:51.294]  What it basically means is to change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that despite of the abundance of information no one is able to come to sensible conclusions.
[00:18:52.273 --> 00:18:52.313]  In
[00:19:07.353 --> 00:19:23.101]  In Washington D.C., your leftists in the United States, all these professors and all these beautiful civil rights defenders, they are instrumental in the process of the subversion only to destabilize the nation.
[00:19:24.255 --> 00:19:27.817]  When their job is completed, they are not needed anymore.
[00:19:28.037 --> 00:19:29.017]  They know too much.
[00:19:29.858 --> 00:19:32.239]  The time bomb is ticking with every second.
[00:19:32.559 --> 00:19:33.819]  Again, it's not a Russian plan.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.861]  The left in America went over to Russia and took it over.
[00:19:36.901 --> 00:19:37.661]  That's on record.
[00:19:38.422 --> 00:19:38.722]  In 1917.
[00:19:39.242 --> 00:19:42.764]  And then exploited Russia to take over much of the planet.
[00:19:43.704 --> 00:19:47.826]  And so when you see the same thing playing out here, understand it's not the Russians running it.
[00:19:48.618 --> 00:19:50.199]  It's the left that wants to get rid of America.
[00:19:50.219 --> 00:19:51.820]  It's the left allied with Communist China.
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:53.941]  I have seen people like this before.
[00:19:55.081 --> 00:19:56.902]  I've seen movements like this before.
[00:19:58.003 --> 00:19:59.924]  I've seen ideas like this before.
[00:20:01.385 --> 00:20:06.467]  And I am here to tell you, we cannot let them take over our country.
[00:20:07.788 --> 00:20:09.429]  I heard the promises of Fidel Castro.
[00:20:10.810 --> 00:20:16.573]  And I can never forget all those who grew up around me, who look like me,
[00:20:18.163 --> 00:20:21.325]  Who suffered, and starved, and died.
[00:20:22.526 --> 00:20:27.269]  Atlantic Monthly, The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and MSNBC, you've seen them all.
[00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:35.035]  You've played the clips, have said, rioting is good, violence is good, protesting is supposed to be violent.
[00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:37.951]  It's supposed to target white people and race war.
[00:20:39.212 --> 00:20:45.796]  Unfortunately, what we've seen in cities all across the country, not just Chicago, is a continuing wave of protests.
[00:20:46.116 --> 00:20:48.277]  The vast majority of these have been peaceful.
[00:20:48.378 --> 00:20:58.904]  Why is Antifa all of a sudden becoming labeled as the most violent element when they were literally here with a buffer between those who were here to harm us?
[00:20:59.124 --> 00:21:02.926]  But video from yesterday suggests that was not always the case.
[00:21:05.367 --> 00:21:16.632]  This Trump supporter spent about two hours trying to have that discussion, but as soon as police allowed Antifa to enter the park, he was attacked, chased for two blocks, and cornered outside a gas station.
[00:21:16.892 --> 00:21:19.593]  We never saw any indication that he was inciting violence.
[00:21:19.653 --> 00:21:23.795]  And they're just conditioning you to accept that their communist overthrow of the country
[00:21:25.034 --> 00:21:29.555]  At the behest of the multinational corporations that just want to divide the nation up like they did communist China.
[00:21:30.856 --> 00:21:36.937]  It's the same globalists that took over Russia, they took over China in 1949, put Mao in, that's been declassified.
[00:21:37.377 --> 00:21:40.218]  It's the globalists that have already done this in Russia and China.
[00:21:40.758 --> 00:21:43.079]  And now they're trying to finish the job here.
[00:21:45.765 --> 00:21:47.406]  That video went up last night.
[00:21:47.546 --> 00:21:48.546]  It's at man.video.
[00:21:48.646 --> 00:21:49.827]  Commie lives matter.
[00:21:50.247 --> 00:21:52.148]  And guess what Twitter is doing now?
[00:21:52.168 --> 00:21:53.508]  Next level censorship.
[00:21:53.568 --> 00:21:57.970]  It should be national news, but of course it isn't because everyone's been conditioned to accept it now.
[00:21:58.750 --> 00:21:59.811]  So now they're censoring the president.
[00:22:00.331 --> 00:22:06.834]  About two weeks ago they started blocking links and making you click and say that you recognize it may be dangerous because it's hate material.
[00:22:07.847 --> 00:22:09.247]  Well, now it's worse than that.
[00:22:09.868 --> 00:22:12.028]  You just cannot even go to the link.
[00:22:12.088 --> 00:22:13.069]  Here's a screenshot of it.
[00:22:13.109 --> 00:22:16.270]  We can put it up in there for an HD version for TV viewers, please.
[00:22:17.650 --> 00:22:19.251]  You guys go to the HD version, please, in there.
[00:22:19.671 --> 00:22:20.011]  There you go.
[00:22:20.031 --> 00:22:20.391]  Thank you.
[00:22:20.931 --> 00:22:23.052]  And it says right there, something went wrong.
[00:22:24.212 --> 00:22:25.712]  But don't fret.
[00:22:27.273 --> 00:22:28.313]  Let's give it another shot.
[00:22:29.013 --> 00:22:30.294]  But down at the bottom it says,
[00:22:32.093 --> 00:22:38.596]  We can't complete the request because this link has been identified by Twitter or our partners as being potentially harmful.
[00:22:38.676 --> 00:22:40.737]  Visit our Help Center to learn more.
[00:22:42.838 --> 00:22:49.801]  And it's not just graphic footage of the rioters going around burning down the city.
[00:22:50.908 --> 00:22:54.071]  It's footage of KGB defectors talking about what's unfolding.
[00:22:54.831 --> 00:22:59.075]  It's footage of President Trump giving speeches, of Melania Trump giving speeches.
[00:22:59.155 --> 00:23:02.557]  It's our live coverage, weeknights, seven to nine.
[00:23:02.918 --> 00:23:14.807]  They don't want that getting out, so the way you do it is with this new URL that is, man.video, all the videos with their own new URL, censoredbyjack.com.
[00:23:15.908 --> 00:23:19.130]  Censored by jack dot com.
[00:23:20.282 --> 00:23:23.525]  One word, censoredbyjack.com.
[00:23:24.246 --> 00:23:28.269]  And you can still share all the links from the site at censoredbyjack.com.
[00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:34.155]  This country, the free world, is in a fight for its very life.
[00:23:37.237 --> 00:23:45.425]  Powerful megacorporations through big tech are openly trying to suppress our freedom.
[00:23:46.533 --> 00:23:55.841]  To communicate freely and our ability to travel and our ability to challenge the lies that are legion about COVID-19.
[00:23:57.122 --> 00:23:58.763]  The technocracy is taking over.
[00:23:59.264 --> 00:24:01.306]  The rollout of the post-human world is here.
[00:24:03.227 --> 00:24:06.190]  And the question is, what are we going to do about it?
[00:24:07.331 --> 00:24:10.834]  I'm going to get into the earth shaking news and the incredible stuff
[00:24:12.461 --> 00:24:23.083]  Unfolding in Kenosha, Wisconsin and the response by the media and the fact that a young man went there and was reportedly attacked repeatedly on tape.
[00:24:27.304 --> 00:24:30.605]  And then he shot and killed two people reportedly.
[00:24:34.306 --> 00:24:35.886]  One of the people being killed is on tape.
[00:24:37.286 --> 00:24:39.067]  Attacking him, running him down with a weapon.
[00:24:40.026 --> 00:24:41.367]  The other man had a pistol in his hand.
[00:24:41.427 --> 00:24:44.288]  He blows the man's arm almost completely off.
[00:24:44.608 --> 00:24:45.448]  That individual lived.
[00:24:46.809 --> 00:24:49.110]  So imagine someone's chasing you down the street with a pistol.
[00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:50.610]  You turn around and shoot them.
[00:24:52.111 --> 00:24:55.092]  And the governor's calling for his arrest.
[00:24:55.132 --> 00:24:56.633]  The police say they're getting ready to make arrest.
[00:24:57.373 --> 00:25:05.096]  The man, and we'll tell you about him in a moment, goes to the police with his hands up and is trying to get to them.
[00:25:08.254 --> 00:25:13.478]  They won't take him into custody because they're in their own vehicles, their own armored vehicles, not wanting to be shot.
[00:25:15.119 --> 00:25:27.908]  When the police stand down and you've got thousands of people going through neighborhoods, burning down houses and businesses, raping and robbing, you're going to have the vacuum filled with citizens and you're going to have street battles.
[00:25:29.709 --> 00:25:35.914]  And it's, of course, trending on the hashtag, call the police, because the Black Lives Matter Antifa individuals
[00:25:36.988 --> 00:25:43.993]  When they start getting shot when they're attacking people with their weapons, they start screaming, call the police, call the police.
[00:25:45.334 --> 00:25:49.797]  Total and complete oxymoronic behavior.
[00:25:49.938 --> 00:25:50.658]  Upside down world.
[00:25:50.698 --> 00:25:51.479]  That's all coming up.
[00:25:51.499 --> 00:25:57.103]  But let me, let me go back to something really important here because this is a big deal.
[00:25:59.093 --> 00:26:05.676]  Remember just two, three years ago, they'd say, oh, there's no online censorship of conservatives or nationalists or patriots.
[00:26:06.396 --> 00:26:08.717]  And now they're like, yeah, we'll censor Trump whenever we want.
[00:26:08.997 --> 00:26:09.778]  We'll censor you.
[00:26:09.818 --> 00:26:12.859]  We'll censor members of Congress, members of the House, the Senate.
[00:26:13.119 --> 00:26:14.180]  We'll censor governors.
[00:26:17.461 --> 00:26:22.243]  When Mitch McConnell says it's wrong, people are at my house threatening to kill me, they censored Mitch McConnell.
[00:26:22.263 --> 00:26:27.826]  But let the people say we're going to kill you, evil turtle, and wave butcher knives around.
[00:26:31.889 --> 00:26:35.810]  And when people come up to your car and point guns at you and say, get out of your car.
[00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.511]  And there's some communist militia member and they get shot.
[00:26:39.951 --> 00:26:41.112]  The left wants them arrested.
[00:26:42.812 --> 00:26:48.394]  They're supposed to be able to go out in live action role play, like they're out at the park, having a game of paintball.
[00:26:48.754 --> 00:26:49.894]  And that's not what's happening.
[00:26:52.555 --> 00:26:59.357]  And it's all the big woke wall street firms and big tech and Nike and
[00:27:01.513 --> 00:27:02.133]  The gap.
[00:27:03.113 --> 00:27:06.014]  Funding the left to go out and do this.
[00:27:07.615 --> 00:27:09.035]  Believing it will overthrow the country.
[00:27:09.415 --> 00:27:11.255]  It's the establishment doing it.
[00:27:12.416 --> 00:27:13.816]  It's the Communist Chinese.
[00:27:13.876 --> 00:27:14.736]  It's the EU.
[00:27:14.816 --> 00:27:15.777]  It's the New World Order.
[00:27:16.077 --> 00:27:16.837]  It's Hollywood.
[00:27:16.997 --> 00:27:18.997]  All ganged up on America.
[00:27:20.058 --> 00:27:22.618]  And the Midwest and the South and the West.
[00:27:23.138 --> 00:27:26.639]  And conservative towns in California and Oregon.
[00:27:27.219 --> 00:27:28.060]  And places like that.
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:29.040]  It's disgusting.
[00:27:31.195 --> 00:27:36.302]  And our tolerance of these thugs and these criminals has conjured the nightmare we're now facing.
[00:27:36.523 --> 00:27:48.059]  I'm going to go over it all in a moment, but first, imagine learning yesterday that any video from Band.Video built their own platform, millions of views a day, you're sharing it.
[00:27:49.377 --> 00:27:56.759]  We take the money that comes in from you buying the products, and the books, and the films, the t-shirts, the supplements, and pay the millions of dollars for the bandwidth.
[00:27:57.099 --> 00:27:58.059]  We've updated the site.
[00:27:58.099 --> 00:27:58.900]  It's working great.
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:00.340]  You're doing a great job.
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:02.921]  It's a key tool in circumventing the censorship.
[00:28:03.161 --> 00:28:04.381]  They said, oh, build your own thing.
[00:28:05.501 --> 00:28:07.042]  And they go after our server companies.
[00:28:07.862 --> 00:28:10.163]  And they go after our fulfillment system.
[00:28:10.183 --> 00:28:11.763]  They go after our credit card processing.
[00:28:11.983 --> 00:28:13.264]  They go after all of it.
[00:28:13.864 --> 00:28:14.524]  Constantly.
[00:28:16.724 --> 00:28:27.094]  And then, Twitter begins totally blocking the link, saying that it's identified as being potentially harmful.
[00:28:27.234 --> 00:28:27.334]  Oh!
[00:28:27.774 --> 00:28:29.896]  Potentially harmful?
[00:28:29.916 --> 00:28:36.463]  The particular video we chose to try to tweet is actually raw footage of the shootout.
[00:28:37.619 --> 00:28:38.759]  But it's all the videos.
[00:28:38.839 --> 00:28:42.701]  It's videos of Trump's speech two days ago that they blocked.
[00:28:42.761 --> 00:28:46.662]  It's every video, it may not video, but you can circumnavigate that.
[00:28:46.742 --> 00:28:47.582]  You can override it.
[00:28:48.102 --> 00:28:55.324]  They wouldn't be suppressing it if it wasn't effective, and it's your enthusiasm, your focus, your fire, your energy, and you were doing that.
[00:28:56.945 --> 00:29:02.887]  We were going from 3-4 million views a day to 6-7-8-9 million views a day, really changing
[00:29:03.752 --> 00:29:12.537]  The landscape and our videos were feeder videos to be picked up everywhere else and duplicated and we were getting, we still are, 20 million views a week on Twitter.
[00:29:13.497 --> 00:29:14.438]  Similar numbers everywhere else.
[00:29:15.018 --> 00:29:15.579]  In the fight.
[00:29:15.699 --> 00:29:18.140]  We don't have advertising on there that we sell.
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.441]  We're not making money.
[00:29:19.921 --> 00:29:26.605]  It's our mission to bring in money from the great radio audience and internet audience that cares to fund this operation as a mothership.
[00:29:27.708 --> 00:29:36.177]  To have the guests, the researchers, the reporters on and to boost other organizations and to fund other groups that are doing a great job to try to win this war.
[00:29:37.819 --> 00:29:40.922]  We use free market business to fund ourselves, but this is not a business.
[00:29:41.523 --> 00:29:47.089]  This is a pro-human defense network fighting for a pro-human future.
[00:29:48.376 --> 00:29:49.659]  And people need to understand this.
[00:29:50.561 --> 00:29:58.898]  When I got up here on air 20-something years ago and I said they want to set up a world government and exterminate 80% of the population, that's because what the UN officially wants is that plan.
[00:30:02.443 --> 00:30:03.624]  I knew it would sound crazy.
[00:30:04.224 --> 00:30:09.027]  I knew people wouldn't go look up the documents until they began to see the program actually set up.
[00:30:09.427 --> 00:30:11.888]  They're collapsing civilization by design.
[00:30:12.148 --> 00:30:13.329]  They're undermining the family.
[00:30:13.569 --> 00:30:15.730]  They're poisoning us with water and the vaccines.
[00:30:16.050 --> 00:30:24.015]  It's their stated goal and now massive numbers of medical doctors are getting it, scientists are getting it, and everything we talked about is becoming mainline.
[00:30:24.835 --> 00:30:26.076]  Because it's being implemented.
[00:30:26.957 --> 00:30:30.239]  I knew during beta test of the New World Order, you wouldn't listen.
[00:30:30.699 --> 00:30:32.740]  The core audience did, because you were dialed in.
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:33.541]  You were already looking.
[00:30:33.801 --> 00:30:35.242]  You already understood for whatever reason.
[00:30:36.243 --> 00:30:37.864]  Experiences in your life, things you'd learned.
[00:30:38.684 --> 00:30:39.545]  Who you were raised with.
[00:30:40.005 --> 00:30:40.886]  Maybe you were in the military.
[00:30:40.906 --> 00:30:43.568]  Maybe you were in areas that let you see things others didn't know about.
[00:30:46.598 --> 00:30:51.001]  But now, this is all going mainline and humanity will have a choice.
[00:30:51.061 --> 00:30:54.904]  Are we going to accept total world government and dehumanization and side with it?
[00:30:56.084 --> 00:30:57.305]  Even though it's going to destroy us?
[00:30:57.666 --> 00:30:59.787]  Just, it'll eat you a little bit later?
[00:31:00.407 --> 00:31:01.468]  Maybe last, you hope?
[00:31:03.530 --> 00:31:09.814]  Or are you going to rally with humanity and get serious and get focused and realize this is a life and death war?
[00:31:12.625 --> 00:31:17.127]  People say, man, you ought to chill out, you ought to have some fun, you ought to... Listen, I'd do that if we weren't in so much trouble.
[00:31:17.447 --> 00:31:19.108]  This is life and death.
[00:31:19.168 --> 00:31:21.490]  If we let them, they're never turning the economy back on.
[00:31:21.910 --> 00:31:24.111]  If we let them, there'll be billions dying within a year.
[00:31:24.551 --> 00:31:25.091]  They admit this.
[00:31:25.151 --> 00:31:26.432]  Hundreds of millions are starving right now.
[00:31:26.452 --> 00:31:30.674]  18 million are going to starve to death this year, conservatively, instead of 10 million.
[00:31:31.155 --> 00:31:33.656]  And it goes straight up at that point.
[00:31:34.889 --> 00:31:39.910]  There were different estimates of a 30% cut in carbon would cause a billion people to die within a decade.
[00:31:40.151 --> 00:31:41.671]  They're cutting it way past that.
[00:31:42.311 --> 00:31:49.113]  I saw numbers of carbon use, energy use, from carbon-based systems is down over 40% worldwide right now.
[00:31:49.933 --> 00:31:51.534]  That means people are gonna die!
[00:31:53.612 --> 00:32:00.696]  For most people, not having that energy access and having the economy break down and not having money for that energy is death.
[00:32:01.636 --> 00:32:02.837]  Death sentence.
[00:32:03.497 --> 00:32:09.301]  And that's why Gates is sitting back and smiling with Fareed Zakaria on CNN going, it's never coming back.
[00:32:10.781 --> 00:32:12.562]  And they're bragging, oh, it's good for the earth.
[00:32:12.943 --> 00:32:14.303]  Oh, it's going to save the climate.
[00:32:14.444 --> 00:32:15.664]  Oh, this is the big reset.
[00:32:15.924 --> 00:32:18.386]  Davos, the head of Davos says, this is good.
[00:32:18.666 --> 00:32:22.268]  Well, COVID's a gift to bring in world government sustainability.
[00:32:25.216 --> 00:32:32.341]  And then as the third world collapses, they're all going to rush us, and then collapse us as well, and then the globalists will have total destruction.
[00:32:32.721 --> 00:32:47.831]  You'll be looking hand-to-mouth for your next meal, and you won't care about politics anymore, and you won't have money to go protest them, and you will be in total squalor, and they'll have a real police state with robots backing them up over you with credit debit cards they give you.
[00:32:48.191 --> 00:32:59.115]  Where you have to socially agree to be sterilized and controlled and live the way they say for just to have credits to buy crappy GMO food that sterilizes you even faster.
[00:32:59.755 --> 00:33:03.296]  That's the reality, not some dystopia I cooked up in my head.
[00:33:03.856 --> 00:33:05.117]  Now are you going to submit to it?
[00:33:06.237 --> 00:33:14.580]  You know, I'm sitting here on this live Wednesday, August 26 transmission with 68 days out from the election.
[00:33:15.982 --> 00:33:18.184]  And I'm just asking all of you, are you going to submit to this tyranny?
[00:33:22.268 --> 00:33:27.894]  Because now is the time to show who you are if you're not like all the others.
[00:33:28.655 --> 00:33:29.516]  You're not a pretender.
[00:33:30.076 --> 00:33:32.359]  Well, I know this audience of activists have not been pretenders.
[00:33:32.379 --> 00:33:34.441]  You've done a great job and I thank you and I salute you, but...
[00:33:35.418 --> 00:33:57.865]  When I get up here and I say, hey, these Council on Foreign Relations publications are canvassing the Pentagon to have a contested election and then overthrow Trump, and they're on the front page of the Washington Post saying, we're going to arrest any members of Trump's cabinet, that if we contest the election and they contest, we're going to forcibly remove Trump.
[00:33:58.165 --> 00:34:00.226]  That's a coup, a physical coup.
[00:34:02.096 --> 00:34:17.103]  And when they're advertising one all over the news and preparing it, first in the think tanks, then in the major establishment news publications, they're telling everybody in DC, you better go along or we're going to kill you.
[00:34:18.604 --> 00:34:23.526]  That's why they have people like Phil Mudd get up on CNN twice and say, we're going to kill the president.
[00:34:25.623 --> 00:34:39.529]  You know, even in the days of Ronald Reagan, who wasn't an authoritarian, or Eisenhower, if you got up on TV and you were formerly the head of the CIA assassination squads, he didn't kill anybody himself, he's a bureaucrat.
[00:34:39.549 --> 00:34:41.770]  Because they always went wimps above the actual killers.
[00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:43.431]  Then they just stay in the actual men.
[00:34:44.771 --> 00:34:53.255]  But Phil Mudd, whose ancestor was the only other person convicted with John Wilkes Booth of killing Lincoln, he's actually related to the same Mudd family, that's why your name is Mudd.
[00:34:55.632 --> 00:35:04.200]  Under any other system, I mean, if you said, we're going to kill the president, and you had the means to do it, you would be found dead in a kayaking accident within a week.
[00:35:05.741 --> 00:35:08.844]  Or, you know, you commit suicide in your garage with the carbon monoxide.
[00:35:08.884 --> 00:35:11.246]  And I don't want to hurt Phil Mudd, he's a piece of crap.
[00:35:11.546 --> 00:35:12.667]  He's garbage, look at him.
[00:35:12.868 --> 00:35:16.411]  He's a little sniveling rat creature that helps sell this country out.
[00:35:16.651 --> 00:35:19.293]  He's a, he's a, he's a, he's a minion of Robert Mueller.
[00:35:20.414 --> 00:35:20.895]  He's a wimp.
[00:35:22.705 --> 00:35:28.447]  But the point is, is that he's allowed to go around and say we're gonna kill the president and cry on TV about it.
[00:35:28.787 --> 00:35:31.307]  That sends a message that Trump's weak and America's weak.
[00:35:32.087 --> 00:35:47.071]  And so they just keep making their runs at us, making their runs at us, making their runs at us, and failing but hurting the country, hurting the world, and destabilizing everything, and then they're allowed another shot, another shot.
[00:35:47.492 --> 00:35:48.432]  Imagine if they
[00:35:49.437 --> 00:35:56.383]  Contest the election, try to have the blue cities and blue states succeed, and attempt to say Biden's the president.
[00:35:57.604 --> 00:36:07.091]  We're just going to sit here and I guess have a civil war, and then the Chai Koms win, and the globalists win, and we're going to have the whole media cheerleading against the country and their own dollar.
[00:36:10.254 --> 00:36:14.077]  I mean, is Stephen Colbert going to move to Communist China when they're successful bringing the U.S.
[00:36:14.117 --> 00:36:14.257]  down?
[00:36:18.353 --> 00:36:32.600]  But you see, John Kerry and Susan Rice and Podesta and all these pedophiles, and I'll say it, I mean the Podestas are pedophiles, sue me, overwhelmingly, overwhelming evidence, they're public about it.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.601]  Especially Tony Podesta, my God.
[00:36:34.621 --> 00:36:40.024]  That's what they, the high-level priests of pedophilia promote it, that's their religion is they want it legalized.
[00:36:40.856 --> 00:37:00.602]  And so, I mean, if you're getting away with full-page, multi-page Washington Post spreads with pictures of toddlers tied up, being tortured, and you say, I've got a dungeon that I enjoy my art in, and he's got vampire teeth, then, I mean, you think you can get away with anything!
[00:37:00.642 --> 00:37:01.683]  My God, why not?
[00:37:04.844 --> 00:37:07.144]  They've been getting away with their crimes forever.
[00:37:08.505 --> 00:37:09.345]  And they think it's funny.
[00:37:10.694 --> 00:37:11.735]  And they think you're going to take it.
[00:37:12.755 --> 00:37:20.979]  And now, if you study criminology, you know at the end, psychos that have gotten away with stuff get reckless because they subconsciously want to be caught.
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:31.825]  And so we're going to allow them, I guess, to destroy the planet, maybe, because we wouldn't stand up to them and get aggressive with them economically, politically, culturally, spiritually.
[00:37:32.866 --> 00:37:37.228]  And that's all I'm saying is, these people are filth.
[00:37:38.353 --> 00:37:41.976]  And they've created armies of little Anderson Coopers that all have that look in their eye.
[00:37:41.996 --> 00:37:49.241]  They've all had their innocence stolen, that then rule over us, and it's a disgusting situation.
[00:37:52.824 --> 00:37:53.084]  All right.
[00:37:54.485 --> 00:38:03.332]  You can cut the seriousness of the situation, the suspense, the danger with a knife in the air.
[00:38:04.432 --> 00:38:07.675]  I won't open the phones up in the next hour, interspersed with a lot of news.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:15.843]  So your take on how do we stop the Civil War?
[00:38:16.444 --> 00:38:19.647]  What do we do about Hillary saying they're going to challenge the election regardless?
[00:38:20.468 --> 00:38:21.729]  And they're going to have states secede?
[00:38:22.811 --> 00:38:28.477]  You know, I told you this over a year ago, because what they put out in the white paper means is what they want to do.
[00:38:31.186 --> 00:38:44.606]  Because they circulate their stuff behind the scenes, then they'll put forward in Atlantic Monthly, or New Yorker Magazine, or Financial Times of London, or New York Times, or Foreign Affairs of the CFR, what they're planning to do.
[00:38:50.575 --> 00:38:51.836]  And I learned that a long time ago.
[00:38:51.856 --> 00:39:00.160]  They had all these articles about geoengineering with barium salts, aluminum dioxide, electromagnetic radiation from towers on the ground, how they were already testing it all over the world.
[00:39:00.581 --> 00:39:02.342]  And then about six years ago, they go ahead and make it public.
[00:39:02.362 --> 00:39:03.662]  They go, OK, we're going to control the weather.
[00:39:04.543 --> 00:39:05.263]  Bill Gates runs it.
[00:39:06.084 --> 00:39:07.865]  And it's a $5 billion program.
[00:39:07.885 --> 00:39:15.569]  Department of Energy has been going on since 1993, the year after a Nobel Prize was won for the plan to stop radiation from the sun, global warming.
[00:39:15.609 --> 00:39:17.270]  That's just their cover for weather weapons.
[00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:20.292]  And then the CIA director four years ago came out and admitted it all.
[00:39:24.867 --> 00:39:36.116]  So, they don't tell you in the CFR, America's over, we're gonna break up the American family, China will run everything and it will be a Chinese model with computers and AI controlling your every movement.
[00:39:36.836 --> 00:39:39.839]  That was in foreign affairs 15 years ago.
[00:39:43.021 --> 00:39:45.303]  And then now they try to do it, and they pretty much have.
[00:39:45.983 --> 00:39:48.946]  Just we're not totally bending over, we're giving them a little bit of resistance.
[00:39:50.871 --> 00:39:57.136]  And so they said they're going to contest the election, have secession, break up the country, burn everything down.
[00:39:57.196 --> 00:39:58.998]  Anyone that resists they'll say is going to be a racist.
[00:39:59.358 --> 00:40:03.141]  They're going to send mobs to all the conservatives and nationalist houses to try to burn us out.
[00:40:03.162 --> 00:40:04.583]  It's going to be a huge war.
[00:40:08.376 --> 00:40:14.121]  And I knew it would shake up like this where it'll be citizens battling Antifa and Black Lives Matter on the streets.
[00:40:14.902 --> 00:40:17.104]  But nobody's going to Obama's house.
[00:40:17.785 --> 00:40:19.286]  Nobody's going to Hillary's house.
[00:40:19.626 --> 00:40:24.050]  Nobody's going to Clapper's house or Brennan's house or Governor Newsom's house.
[00:40:24.431 --> 00:40:30.216]  We're all just going to act like idiots in a civil war and kill each other on the streets like morons and let that be the civil war.
[00:40:30.597 --> 00:40:34.320]  Instead of the president getting serious with the Pentagon and others and saying,
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.140]  Enough of this.
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:36.901]  Enough of this dialectic crap.
[00:40:37.201 --> 00:40:41.043]  Enough playing this game of dividing America and having some synthesis out of it.
[00:40:41.443 --> 00:40:44.624]  The synthesis always moves us into the left-hand path of evil.
[00:40:45.184 --> 00:40:48.986]  It's not some synthesis of order and balance in the system.
[00:40:49.246 --> 00:40:50.306]  That's an Illuminati lie.
[00:40:50.647 --> 00:40:52.707]  It's always leading us towards destruction.
[00:40:53.568 --> 00:40:54.388]  And it needs to stop.
[00:40:56.589 --> 00:41:01.411]  And if there were real indictments by Durham of high-level people, it would just end there.
[00:41:01.551 --> 00:41:03.852]  But we keep showing weakness to this.
[00:41:05.646 --> 00:41:08.687]  I'm going to go to break, ladies and gentlemen, but I've got to tell you, you need storable food.
[00:41:08.727 --> 00:41:09.827]  You need storable food now.
[00:41:10.248 --> 00:41:12.388]  We have high quality, ready to ship within one to two weeks.
[00:41:12.408 --> 00:41:13.229]  They've just got to package it.
[00:41:13.869 --> 00:41:15.510]  We have specialty diets, all of it.
[00:41:15.550 --> 00:41:17.270]  We have the biggest, best company in the world.
[00:41:17.610 --> 00:41:19.011]  MyPatriot, they're in our back end.
[00:41:19.051 --> 00:41:20.191]  You order from us, you're ordering from them.
[00:41:20.411 --> 00:41:24.933]  They're full selection, you get the best deal, and your orders go right to where they come into the queue.
[00:41:25.413 --> 00:41:26.654]  They're ready to ship one or two weeks.
[00:41:26.814 --> 00:41:35.200]  I predict as the unrest increases, I predict as it comes out, they're going to challenge the election publicly and break up the country, that you're going to have even bigger breakdowns in society.
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:36.801]  Food shortages are already happening.
[00:41:36.841 --> 00:41:38.462]  Breakdown of supply chains.
[00:41:38.702 --> 00:41:39.803]  Food prices are going up.
[00:41:40.183 --> 00:41:47.508]  The big safe bet with insurance you can eat, so you know it's 100% safe bet, is Infowarestore.com and the high quality storable food there.
[00:41:47.648 --> 00:41:49.709]  A one month, a three month, a six month, a year.
[00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:53.772]  We're talking this stuff on average is five times less expensive than food at the grocery store.
[00:41:54.032 --> 00:41:55.333]  And a lot of times it's even better quality.
[00:41:55.973 --> 00:41:56.253]  Absolutely.
[00:41:56.273 --> 00:42:02.175]  It lasts 25 years, MFORESTORE.COM, and then the profit that comes in funds our operation to keep us on air.
[00:42:02.495 --> 00:42:04.976]  That is a true non-zero-sum game, a 360 win.
[00:42:05.516 --> 00:42:20.761]  So, get your storable food now, get your other survival implements at MFORESTORE.COM, and I would recommend you get firearms and ammunition defensively and learn how to use it very, very quickly, because if you have not learned how to defend yourself, you should get a shotgun immediately and go get training.
[00:42:20.821 --> 00:42:21.741]  It's very easy to use.
[00:42:22.561 --> 00:42:23.981]  And, uh, you need to get ready.
[00:42:24.362 --> 00:42:26.302]  So this is, this is no time to be playing games.
[00:42:26.942 --> 00:42:27.942]  This is the real deal.
[00:42:27.962 --> 00:42:29.843]  This is everything I told you about for 26 years.
[00:42:30.203 --> 00:42:31.203]  Everything we told you was coming.
[00:42:31.223 --> 00:42:32.624]  You notice it's here exactly as we said.
[00:42:32.884 --> 00:42:34.584]  With a virus as the cover for the lockdown.
[00:42:34.604 --> 00:42:35.805]  The UN running it all.
[00:42:36.025 --> 00:42:37.225]  The UN saying you will take it.
[00:42:37.245 --> 00:42:39.246]  And the nation's UN is now our master.
[00:42:39.306 --> 00:42:40.506]  They've announced three days ago.
[00:42:40.526 --> 00:42:41.646]  I mean, it's here.
[00:42:42.506 --> 00:42:44.447]  So get the storeable food at infowarestore.com.
[00:42:44.467 --> 00:42:51.549]  But whatever you do, share all the videos and the live feeds from the great new URL we have, censoredbyjack.com.
[00:42:54.295 --> 00:42:56.337]  What about EMS recombination?
[00:42:58.078 --> 00:42:59.019]  We've already tried it.
[00:42:59.740 --> 00:43:04.103]  Ethyl methane sulfonate is an alkylating agent and a potent mutagen.
[00:43:04.163 --> 00:43:10.449]  It created a virus so lethal the subject was dead before we left the table.
[00:43:10.689 --> 00:43:13.952]  Then a repressive protein that blocks the operating cells.
[00:43:14.072 --> 00:43:18.736]  Wouldn't obstruct replication but it does give rise to an error in replication so that the
[00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:24.541]  Newly formed DNA strand carries the mutation and you've got a virus again.
[00:43:26.061 --> 00:43:31.362]  But, uh, this, all of this is... academic.
[00:43:32.603 --> 00:43:34.563]  You were made as well as we could make you.
[00:43:35.143 --> 00:43:36.143]  But not to last.
[00:43:37.724 --> 00:43:40.684]  The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long.
[00:43:41.284 --> 00:43:44.265]  And you have burned so very, very brightly, Roy.
[00:43:45.945 --> 00:43:46.425]  Look at you.
[00:43:47.806 --> 00:43:48.886]  You're the prodigal son.
[00:43:50.805 --> 00:43:52.626]  You're quite a prize.
[00:43:59.868 --> 00:44:02.409]  I've done questionable things.
[00:44:03.169 --> 00:44:04.790]  Also extraordinary things.
[00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:11.753]  Revel in your time.
[00:44:12.173 --> 00:44:15.174]  I think the god of biomechanics wouldn't let you in heaven.
[00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:04.851]  That little clip makes me think about Bill Gates.
[00:45:07.752 --> 00:45:09.773]  A real mad scientist, not a fictional one.
[00:45:11.223 --> 00:45:25.271]  When you hear about going in and actually changing the DNA of cells themselves, for Blade Runner, the original, they did some real scientific research and found out they'd done tests and found that it always gave rise to viruses and other things that would kill the body.
[00:45:28.874 --> 00:45:34.597]  But now, with the new DNA vaccines that make 100% of people sick, with the strong vaccine,
[00:45:36.534 --> 00:45:39.918]  Of those that take the weak vaccine and 20% of those go to the hospital.
[00:45:40.699 --> 00:45:44.623]  And that's what Bill Gates is admitting and smiling at you and saying you will take it.
[00:45:47.639 --> 00:45:54.984]  And I've been spending a lot of time researching the patents on all the new COVID-19 vaccines they made four years ago, five years ago, two years ago, a year ago.
[00:45:55.505 --> 00:46:08.974]  Oh yeah, Bill Gates has been a busy little beaver, creating a whole bunch of strains of bat coronavirus chimeras, spliced with four other viruses, the HIV delivery system, all the P shuttle gene injection points are there.
[00:46:11.136 --> 00:46:14.078]  And they've got something really special planned for us.
[00:46:15.799 --> 00:46:16.640]  What we do know is,
[00:46:17.836 --> 00:46:26.958]  If you take it, the vaccine doesn't protect you and they're already learning that it's connected to having lower immunity to the regular cold bug.
[00:46:27.698 --> 00:46:31.219]  So this is a very, very dangerous situation.
[00:46:31.239 --> 00:46:32.799]  They're going to do mass experimentation.
[00:46:32.999 --> 00:46:33.680]  Well, they already are.
[00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:36.500]  Several hundred vaccines are in trials.
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:39.721]  Animal trials have just all been skipped because they never were skipped.
[00:46:40.281 --> 00:46:41.921]  They've been developing these for decades.
[00:46:42.702 --> 00:46:43.642]  They've got them on the shelf.
[00:46:44.804 --> 00:46:50.930]  And now they're doing trials on humans openly to see if they can manage covering up how many die, how many get sick.
[00:46:52.651 --> 00:47:05.923]  And so it's very important that they not get away with it, because just like with Gardasil, they were testing to see how many women they could kill, little girls they could sterilize and kill, and maim and give autoimmune diseases to, and how well they could cover it up in the medical literature.
[00:47:06.163 --> 00:47:06.744]  It didn't work.
[00:47:06.804 --> 00:47:09.546]  It's caused a massive awakening in the medical system.
[00:47:10.247 --> 00:47:11.028]  So we're seeing a
[00:47:13.502 --> 00:47:14.743]  Infinity double down?
[00:47:14.763 --> 00:47:19.445]  I mean, let's say the previous vaccine hype was a hundred.
[00:47:19.485 --> 00:47:20.365]  This is like a billion.
[00:47:20.825 --> 00:47:22.606]  I mean, this whole power grab.
[00:47:22.806 --> 00:47:26.028]  You'll have to have it to buy and sell, to leave your house, to have a job, to get on a plane.
[00:47:26.348 --> 00:47:28.088]  You'll have digital tattoos under the skin.
[00:47:28.409 --> 00:47:31.930]  Gates is hopping around, giggling and smiling, talking about depopulation.
[00:47:32.310 --> 00:47:34.511]  I mean, they're just psychos on parade.
[00:47:35.152 --> 00:47:35.752]  Crazy town.
[00:47:36.672 --> 00:47:40.974]  A lot of folks are going to roll their sleeves up for their kids and give them a shot, and that kid's going to roll out and die.
[00:47:41.274 --> 00:47:42.555]  And mom's going to be proud of herself.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:44.620]  We're alive!
[00:47:45.461 --> 00:47:46.341]  We're alive!
[00:47:47.121 --> 00:47:48.122]  And we're fighting back!
[00:47:49.882 --> 00:47:54.184]  We're not gonna be facing the New World Order sitting down or on our knees.
[00:47:54.204 --> 00:47:58.806]  We're not gonna be caught flat-footed, but in the attack.
[00:48:02.228 --> 00:48:05.629]  And the enemy's scared, and they're exhausted, and they're sniveling.
[00:48:06.909 --> 00:48:10.431]  Oh, they've got all the stolen wealth and all the stolen science, but they don't know what to do with it.
[00:48:11.687 --> 00:48:12.868]  They're surrounded by enemies.
[00:48:13.548 --> 00:48:14.429]  They all hate each other.
[00:48:14.449 --> 00:48:15.169]  They don't have love.
[00:48:16.890 --> 00:48:21.532]  They're easy to defeat if we just simply ask God to lead, guide, and direct us.
[00:48:21.612 --> 00:48:22.653]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[00:48:22.913 --> 00:48:23.734]  Let me get the number out.
[00:48:24.633 --> 00:48:28.435]  Ahead of Ali Alexander joining us in studio.
[00:48:28.475 --> 00:48:30.476]  Great political pundit, great writer, great analyst.
[00:48:30.856 --> 00:48:33.378]  I used to have him on all the time during the last election and after.
[00:48:33.398 --> 00:48:35.599]  And for some reason we didn't have him on for a while.
[00:48:35.619 --> 00:48:38.841]  And I remember how interesting he was, just like Deanna Lorraine.
[00:48:38.921 --> 00:48:45.405]  I was like, you know, we need more people to be pundits and more folks during the election to be part of the nighttime show we're going to be doing.
[00:48:45.425 --> 00:48:47.306]  7 to 9 that we've already launched.
[00:48:48.166 --> 00:48:49.107]  Election countdown.
[00:48:50.290 --> 00:48:51.232]  Take back America.
[00:48:51.573 --> 00:48:52.494]  Taking back America.
[00:48:52.995 --> 00:48:54.398]  And the show's very well produced.
[00:48:54.538 --> 00:48:55.740]  The crew's doing a great job.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:58.005]  Deanna Lorraine is going to host.
[00:48:59.008 --> 00:48:59.848]  Three nights a week.
[00:48:59.948 --> 00:49:02.009]  Owen Schroer is going to host a couple nights a week.
[00:49:02.029 --> 00:49:03.569]  I'm going to be hosting some.
[00:49:03.629 --> 00:49:04.730]  Savannah Hernandez.
[00:49:04.810 --> 00:49:20.515]  And I hope people like Ali Alexander and also Robert Barnes, who did a great job in our beta test for Countdown America, similar to Countdown to the election, will also be part of the transmission and was last night.
[00:49:20.995 --> 00:49:21.855]  So 7 to 9.
[00:49:22.535 --> 00:49:26.156]  And there's only six minutes of breaks in the show.
[00:49:26.597 --> 00:49:27.797]  We're not running any of our ads.
[00:49:29.923 --> 00:49:30.864]  I'm very excited about it.
[00:49:30.884 --> 00:49:33.406]  A lot of radio stations and TV stations are picking it up.
[00:49:35.027 --> 00:49:37.148]  And, of course, you can find it at man.video.
[00:49:37.209 --> 00:49:41.372]  But you can't share that link on Twitter, and I'm sure soon on Facebook and other places.
[00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:46.816]  You've got to share censoredbyjack.com.
[00:49:48.837 --> 00:49:55.803]  Because Twitter says it's dangerous and it's an evil website when you try to share the link or you try to click on the link.
[00:49:56.857 --> 00:50:00.999]  That's what happens to old links that are up on the Twitter sphere as well.
[00:50:01.679 --> 00:50:09.062]  All of this election meddling, trying to silence the American people so that we can't show you in context what's really going on.
[00:50:10.223 --> 00:50:17.866]  So here's the toll free number on Hillary saying, if you missed it, we'll play the clip again in a moment, that they're going to contest the election
[00:50:20.009 --> 00:50:25.334]  They know they're going to lose, and that they're going to try to have secession and break up the country.
[00:50:25.394 --> 00:50:29.877]  The full report is at Banned.Video, where I show all the Pelosi quotes and other quotes.
[00:50:30.618 --> 00:50:42.508]  It's very, very important because they know that all the major projections now coming out show Trump winning 322 delegates versus a Democrat 210.
[00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:47.993]  And they are very, very scared and very, very upset.
[00:50:49.164 --> 00:51:11.785]  Okay, before I get into what's happening and the nights of street battles and the rest of it in areas of Wisconsin and other parts of the country, I thought I'd show this video that's probably got 50 million views, just from the places I've seen it, 10 million here, 8 million there, 9, 2 million there, I mean just crazy, of this woman in a DC restaurant where BLM goons, thugs,
[00:51:13.186 --> 00:51:20.852]  Mainly white people, virtue signaling, come in and get in her face and tell her, silence, white silence is violence.
[00:51:21.272 --> 00:51:34.922]  You will raise your hand and pledge allegiance to us when it's a mainly white run, George Soros, Nazi collaborator organization founded by three obese black lesbians who say they hate men and hate the family.
[00:51:36.015 --> 00:51:37.336]  Well, of course that's what Soros was funding.
[00:51:37.356 --> 00:51:40.778]  The number one mission is black men to cut their genitals off.
[00:51:40.898 --> 00:51:41.158]  Wow!
[00:51:41.879 --> 00:51:42.519]  We're here to help.
[00:51:42.559 --> 00:51:43.780]  We want to cut your genitals off.
[00:51:43.820 --> 00:51:44.760]  We don't like a family.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:45.661]  We love black people.
[00:51:46.101 --> 00:51:47.342]  It's just Planned Parenthood 2.0.
[00:51:49.283 --> 00:51:53.126]  And the full video from a bunch of angles is up on Infowars.com.
[00:51:53.186 --> 00:51:53.946]  And it goes on and on.
[00:51:54.126 --> 00:51:54.907]  Are you a Christian?
[00:51:54.967 --> 00:52:00.110]  BLM activists harass restaurant patrons who refuse to raise their fists and shout slogans.
[00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:01.631]  They're told what slogans?
[00:52:03.114 --> 00:52:04.755]  That they are supposed to put out.
[00:52:04.915 --> 00:52:08.937]  And in a world of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.
[00:52:09.937 --> 00:52:20.923]  Matt Walsh on Twitter said, honestly, this is the most striking illustration of courageousness and self-determination versus gutless, mindless conformity that I've ever seen in my life.
[00:52:21.243 --> 00:52:21.463]  Bingo.
[00:52:21.483 --> 00:52:22.364]  Go ahead and roll the clips.
[00:52:25.002 --> 00:52:28.223]  It is a scrawny
[00:52:52.022 --> 00:53:08.066]  20-something-year-old men, little boys, with what looks like malnourished, probably never were breastfed, very low IQ white people, screaming at her, pointing at her, leaning over in her space, and just demanding that she submit to them.
[00:53:09.567 --> 00:53:11.207]  And this is just communist youth brigades.
[00:53:11.227 --> 00:53:12.487]  This is Maoist youth brigades.
[00:53:12.527 --> 00:53:14.148]  This is what it is.
[00:53:14.208 --> 00:53:18.669]  And then we've got all the footage around the country, people trying to pull in to get gas.
[00:53:19.682 --> 00:53:24.865]  And Black Lives Matter gets in their face, blocks their vehicle, and then bumps the car screaming, you're attacking me!
[00:53:25.205 --> 00:53:25.746]  Police!
[00:53:25.866 --> 00:53:26.446]  Police!
[00:53:28.327 --> 00:53:31.990]  So we can roll a local news report on that.
[00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.370]  Here it is.
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:38.942]  ...moments today as protesters tried to block access to the gas station where Palloran was killed.
[00:53:39.402 --> 00:53:48.865]  Now luckily no one was injured during that encounter right there, but it did lead to a heated exchange between the protesters and the driver who drove through the blockade.
[00:53:49.245 --> 00:53:51.846]  Kendria LaFleur joins us live from the gas station.
[00:53:51.966 --> 00:53:55.747]  And Kendria, why were the protesters blocking the gas station in the first place?
[00:53:56.127 --> 00:53:57.188]  They're not protesters.
[00:53:57.208 --> 00:54:02.373]  They're communists trying to cause events and to get violence to say that they were physically attacked.
[00:54:02.393 --> 00:54:03.534]  They're beating on the vehicle.
[00:54:04.235 --> 00:54:06.316]  Once you stop, they try to drag you out of your vehicle.
[00:54:06.677 --> 00:54:08.959]  You would be insane to not keep moving.
[00:54:08.979 --> 00:54:09.840]  He did the right thing.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:14.644]  He rolled at about a quarter mile an hour as they were attacking his vehicle for his own safety.
[00:54:15.225 --> 00:54:17.727]  And they're lucky he didn't get out with a baseball bat and beat the brains out.
[00:54:18.047 --> 00:54:18.768]  That's what they want.
[00:54:18.808 --> 00:54:19.749]  Let's continue with the newscast.
[00:54:20.891 --> 00:54:25.955]  For about an hour, protesters surrounded the gas station where Trafford Pellerin was shot and killed by police.
[00:54:46.994 --> 00:54:55.679]  We're first appalled that when we first came here the night or the day after Trayford was murdered, that the building was still open for business.
[00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:59.862]  They were insensitive to the fact that he was murdered there.
[00:54:59.962 --> 00:55:05.465]  So much so to the point to where now, even still till today, there's a trashcan in the spot to where he's murdered.
[00:55:07.421 --> 00:55:10.843]  But during their protest, one driver pulled in to get gas.
[00:55:10.943 --> 00:55:12.444]  Don't let go of the people next to me.
[00:55:12.965 --> 00:55:16.327]  I just like, we were all screaming that, don't let go, don't break the chain, don't let go.
[00:55:16.687 --> 00:55:19.129]  And so that was really all I was thinking, was just don't let go.
[00:55:19.329 --> 00:55:25.774]  Slowly, the truck drove in, breaking the human chain that caused a confrontation between some protesters and the driver.
[00:55:26.874 --> 00:55:30.517]  During that confrontation, the driver saying he just wanted some fuel.
[00:55:30.537 --> 00:55:31.838]  Hold the line!
[00:55:31.898 --> 00:55:34.299]  Hold the line now!
[00:55:34.319 --> 00:55:36.281]  I can't watch anymore, let's turn it off.
[00:55:38.314 --> 00:55:39.435]  Oh my gosh.
[00:55:39.655 --> 00:55:46.600]  The number to join us, first-time callers, again I want to give you a chance to get on board on your view of where this is going.
[00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:47.621]  They've told us where it's going.
[00:55:47.921 --> 00:55:49.042]  They're going to contest the election.
[00:55:49.062 --> 00:55:50.223]  They're going to cause a civil war.
[00:55:50.823 --> 00:55:52.925]  They admit they're pre-planning all of this.
[00:55:53.825 --> 00:55:57.208]  And the whole media is on their side to just aid and abet this.
[00:55:57.228 --> 00:55:59.890]  And they're going to make the attempted overthrow of the elected government.
[00:56:00.350 --> 00:56:01.431]  A black versus white thing.
[00:56:01.751 --> 00:56:06.955]  Because if you made it a George Soros, New World Order, Chai Comp thing, Americans would come together and say, no, we're not letting this happen.
[00:56:07.215 --> 00:56:11.219]  But that's what this is, is a multinational attempt to take down of our republic.
[00:56:11.239 --> 00:56:11.379]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:56:11.399 --> 00:56:11.439]  877-789-2539.
[00:56:11.459 --> 00:56:11.659]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:56:20.618 --> 00:56:23.659]  I want to take your calls on what you think is coming next and what needs to be done.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:30.902]  Now when we come back, Black Lives Matter threatened family of teen who killed rioters that attempted to murder him.
[00:56:32.103 --> 00:56:34.684]  That's right, they've been already shooting at him, chasing him with guns.
[00:56:35.564 --> 00:56:36.444]  He killed two of them.
[00:56:37.245 --> 00:56:48.529]  One guy with a gun in his hand, you can see it right here, got part of his arm blown off because he was physically pointing the gun at him, leaning over him and the young man shot him with what looks like a 5.56.
[00:56:50.407 --> 00:56:54.168]  Blowing off part of his upper forearm.
[00:56:55.689 --> 00:56:57.409]  So we're going to show you the raw footage.
[00:56:57.429 --> 00:56:58.510]  Viewer discretion advised.
[00:56:58.550 --> 00:56:59.850]  I'll break it down for radio listeners.
[00:57:00.451 --> 00:57:03.892]  On the other side and the police are saying they're looking for him to arrest him.
[00:57:03.912 --> 00:57:04.872]  He tried to turn himself in.
[00:57:05.232 --> 00:57:08.994]  But it'll be funner if they like SWAT team him and act like he's the bad guy and everything.
[00:57:09.274 --> 00:57:13.475]  Because the number one rule is punish anyone that doesn't lay down to communists.
[00:57:13.715 --> 00:57:14.335]  We'll be right back.
[00:57:17.136 --> 00:57:18.237]  So a vacuum
[00:57:19.923 --> 00:57:48.082]  It takes place anytime that the local constabulary stands down and the authorities, the mainstream media, and the presidents and governors, former presidents, come out and say that rioting and looting and doing all this is a good thing and that it's protesting to shoot people and burn things down and to set up your own checkpoints on roads and shoot into people's vehicles and many times wounding them, killing them, putting them in comas.
[00:57:50.336 --> 00:57:53.076]  That is called protesting now under the communist system.
[00:57:54.597 --> 00:57:56.457]  These are the heroes.
[00:57:57.277 --> 00:58:01.338]  There's an excellent video report at newswars.com titled, Commie Lives Matter.
[00:58:01.698 --> 00:58:03.018]  You should see, we played it last hour.
[00:58:05.479 --> 00:58:19.281]  But in Kenosha, when citizens showed up from other parts of the state and from Illinois and other areas to simply stand around with firearms and guard homes, neighborhoods and businesses,
[00:58:20.523 --> 00:58:21.203]  They were attacked.
[00:58:22.084 --> 00:58:25.946]  I watched over an hour of this last night.
[00:58:25.966 --> 00:58:27.007]  I watched over an hour this morning.
[00:58:27.027 --> 00:58:28.568]  There are hundreds and hundreds of videos.
[00:58:29.549 --> 00:58:31.350]  Very, very, very, very graphic stuff.
[00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:41.316]  But what you see is hordes of people coming up to homes, coming up to businesses, coming up to car dealerships and burning and smashing things.
[00:58:41.776 --> 00:58:44.538]  And the guys with guns step back and let them do it.
[00:58:45.518 --> 00:58:47.760]  And then that gets the mobs, who are also armed,
[00:58:48.897 --> 00:59:13.779]  saying shoot me come on let's go and start pointing their weapons and then they get shot and that's what the footage shows and then after the person shoots him to defend himself he runs and a man chases him with a gun tries to shoot the man on the ground that has a gun but isn't even able to fire the revolver right and the man with the firearm blows his arm partially off
[00:59:15.469 --> 00:59:16.389]  This is shocking footage.
[00:59:16.409 --> 00:59:20.371]  I'm going to play it with the audio in a moment, but National Review actually did a good job breaking it down.
[00:59:20.451 --> 00:59:24.792]  Black Lives Matter threatens family of teen who killed rioters that attempted to murder him.
[00:59:24.812 --> 00:59:35.876]  17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse shot and killed two looters in self-defense late Tuesday night during the Black Lives Matter riot in Kenosha, Wisconsin.
[00:59:37.116 --> 00:59:43.378]  Now, riot sympathizers are spreading his address on social media, and his family is being threatened.
[00:59:44.551 --> 00:59:59.864]  Part of the contingent of armed citizens who were patrolling the streets of Kenosha in order to protect property and lives from looters, arsonists, and violent street criminals who have been plaguing the city with wanted destruction for three straight nights following the shooting of Jacob Blake.
[01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:03.508]  And they act like the cops came in cold blood to want to kill him.
[01:00:04.605 --> 01:00:09.488]  Jacob Blake, when he's running around fighting them, attacking them, had all these arrests, backgrounds, sex assault, you name it.
[01:00:10.268 --> 01:00:14.931]  As if the cops want to kill this guy and then probably get indicted if it wasn't perfect how they did it.
[01:00:14.991 --> 01:00:20.835]  I mean, this is how you're going to make all the good cops quit, which is what the left wants, then they put their people in, and then you're living in Venezuela.
[01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:28.816]  So here's some of the footage, and towards the end, Rittenhouse goes to the armored vehicles, the police, to try to turn himself in to tell what really happened.
[01:00:29.036 --> 01:00:29.817]  They won't take him.
[01:00:30.397 --> 01:00:37.764]  Then the media spins he deserves to be arrested, and the Kenosha Sheriff says arrests are coming after two killed during Night of Mayhem.
[01:00:38.145 --> 01:00:40.127]  They say they know who did it, and they're going to be arresting him.
[01:00:42.694 --> 01:00:45.655]  But, they haven't done that yet.
[01:00:45.735 --> 01:00:51.058]  Yeah, it's just incredible footage and stuff's coming out of him being attacked, others being attacked, they defending themselves.
[01:00:51.078 --> 01:00:57.021]  So let's roll the footage as they're burning a car dealership and surrounding men with guns trying to protect it.
[01:00:57.541 --> 01:01:01.403]  One guy, I'm not going to play because he's cussing so much, just keeps saying, shoot me, n-word, shoot me, n-word.
[01:01:01.423 --> 01:01:03.984]  It's a white guy and he gets shot in the head and dies, so here it is.
[01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:11.628]  In the car dealership.
[01:01:12.867 --> 01:01:17.869]  Black people, white people, going around beating up the cars, later they set them on fire.
[01:01:19.929 --> 01:01:23.671]  And they start shooting, that's what the witnesses say, at the men with guns trying to protect them.
[01:01:24.511 --> 01:01:25.691]  But they're running at them with guns.
[01:01:26.592 --> 01:01:28.072]  Well, one of the guys gets shot in the head.
[01:01:28.092 --> 01:01:30.333]  It's like, oh, this hit in a video game?
[01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:41.437]  And then you see that a conservative reporter, Daily Caller, goes over and
[01:01:42.645 --> 01:01:45.887]  Takes his shirt off, puts it over the guy's head, tries to help, but you can see he's dying right there.
[01:01:46.867 --> 01:01:48.088]  Been shot in the head.
[01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:58.414]  And just minutes before, he was boastfully, like the guy that got shot in Austin a few weeks ago, saying, you ain't gonna do nothing, you ain't gonna do nothing.
[01:01:58.434 --> 01:02:01.276]  The groups are standing off with guns.
[01:02:02.438 --> 01:02:02.938]  We're good to go.
[01:02:19.426 --> 01:02:21.968]  It's a sad day.
[01:02:22.589 --> 01:02:24.210]  Keep your eyes open.
[01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.092]  Keep your eyes open.
[01:02:26.192 --> 01:02:26.773]  You're okay.
[01:02:26.973 --> 01:02:27.814]  You're okay.
[01:02:27.834 --> 01:02:28.214]  You're okay.
[01:02:28.294 --> 01:02:29.515]  No, he's not okay.
[01:02:29.555 --> 01:02:30.957]  You've got to keep him alive.
[01:02:30.977 --> 01:02:31.938]  You've got to keep him alive.
[01:02:31.998 --> 01:02:33.359]  This is all the virgins signaling.
[01:02:33.419 --> 01:02:39.765]  Here they are chasing the guy down the road.
[01:02:47.956 --> 01:02:49.678]  They're attacking him and they've got guns.
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:52.661]  Reportedly they fire first.
[01:02:52.721 --> 01:02:53.302]  This is what happens.
[01:03:02.972 --> 01:03:04.273]  Shoots that guy in the arm.
[01:03:05.635 --> 01:03:06.396]  Other guy's already down.
[01:03:08.578 --> 01:03:09.159]  So there you go.
[01:03:10.948 --> 01:03:16.772]  Imagine they're chasing a guy with a M4 who's already killed one person.
[01:03:16.832 --> 01:03:25.358]  That's a really good idea.
[01:03:25.598 --> 01:03:35.044]  Then they start calling the police for help and whining and demanding the police do something even though they want them all abolished and have burned the police station down partially.
[01:03:38.747 --> 01:03:40.308]  Here's a photo of the individual before he got shot.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.644]  Rioter repeatedly says, shoot me, N-word.
[01:03:45.224 --> 01:03:46.846]  Gets shot in the head moments later.
[01:03:46.866 --> 01:03:50.772]  Go back.
[01:03:52.233 --> 01:03:53.315]  And they're yelling at the cops.
[01:03:53.355 --> 01:03:54.456]  He's over here, he's over here.
[01:03:54.476 --> 01:03:58.842]  And the guy puts his hands out and the police won't take him.
[01:03:59.122 --> 01:03:59.843]  Medic!
[01:04:01.937 --> 01:04:03.038]  That was not me!
[01:04:03.098 --> 01:04:11.583]  I just saved him!
[01:04:11.603 --> 01:04:13.804]  Keep him right there, we're coming out to you.
[01:04:14.064 --> 01:04:16.445]  That guy might have to have his arm amputated.
[01:04:16.505 --> 01:04:18.847]  It moved more than half of it away.
[01:04:19.527 --> 01:04:21.408]  Because the guy shot him one in the groin.
[01:04:21.508 --> 01:04:26.111]  Because he had a pistol extended out at Rittenhouse.
[01:04:30.546 --> 01:04:47.341]  So the armored vehicles arrive, the police surround, take the wounded guy away, and then coming up there's the footage of Rittenhouse trying to turn himself in.
[01:04:48.242 --> 01:04:50.644]  And now the rioters are saying, he's the bad guy, police get him.
[01:04:53.667 --> 01:04:54.888]  And this goes on for several minutes.
[01:04:57.682 --> 01:05:01.404]  And Rittenhouse goes over and sits on the side of the street with his hands up, and the police never arrest him.
[01:05:02.905 --> 01:05:05.266]  But now the media says, oh, he's fleeing, we're gonna get him.
[01:05:06.287 --> 01:05:10.809]  I'm sure the police will virtually signal and probably bow and probably execute Rittenhouse.
[01:05:13.030 --> 01:05:15.211]  Because the police are on the left now in most cities.
[01:05:21.035 --> 01:05:25.297]  So he's trying to go over and tell the police that he just defended himself, but he's unable to.
[01:05:28.953 --> 01:05:39.136]  We're gonna come back directly to your phone calls straight ahead, but I told you they're gonna ratchet this up towards the election and try to make the whole thing racial, but it's not.
[01:05:39.176 --> 01:05:40.216]  It's about a globalist takeover.
[01:05:41.177 --> 01:05:52.800]  Just as day follows night and night follows day, I predicted this morning that Kyle Rittenhouse would be charged with first-degree murder
[01:05:54.580 --> 01:05:59.244]  And well, they are trying to now basically put him in jail forever, or I guess get him executed.
[01:05:59.724 --> 01:06:04.148]  Wisconsin vigilante shooter charged with murder.
[01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:11.214]  Even though, you can look at the photos and videos, he's being chased by men with guns.
[01:06:12.134 --> 01:06:17.519]  And the man extended his hand with the revolver at him when he pulled the trigger.
[01:06:18.219 --> 01:06:21.142]  But because he was a citizen standing up to communist looters,
[01:06:24.428 --> 01:06:25.709]  They'll probably be put in prison.
[01:06:26.369 --> 01:06:29.832]  Now, he killed reportedly two white people, so it's not going to be as bad.
[01:06:30.992 --> 01:06:32.433]  My God, the whole country would burn.
[01:06:32.653 --> 01:06:34.195]  Whites would do it if they were black.
[01:06:35.275 --> 01:06:41.860]  But I'd say 80% of the looters and rioters are white trying to trigger the Communist Revolution.
[01:06:43.821 --> 01:06:49.665]  Again, the tweets are going out, the video stills are showing, armed person on the ground a split second before he presumably gets shot.
[01:06:50.605 --> 01:06:54.168]  I don't know how he is the one of the two dead.
[01:06:56.069 --> 01:06:58.211]  So again, this is the type of stuff that's going on.
[01:06:59.232 --> 01:07:06.179]  The looters began to reportedly, according to witnesses, shoot at and attack Kyle Rittenhouse.
[01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:09.562]  An individual gets shot in the head in response.
[01:07:09.642 --> 01:07:11.243]  He runs down the street towards police.
[01:07:12.304 --> 01:07:13.926]  He gets chased down by armed men.
[01:07:14.646 --> 01:07:17.489]  He shoots and kills one, shoots the other man in the arm.
[01:07:17.529 --> 01:07:21.072]  The media reported unarmed, even though you can see clear as day if you pull up the
[01:07:21.994 --> 01:07:24.176]  National Review article has the best screenshot of it.
[01:07:24.216 --> 01:07:26.158]  You can see that for yourself.
[01:07:26.178 --> 01:07:29.500]  We're going to go to your phone calls here.
[01:07:29.581 --> 01:07:33.744]  But this is all the planning and it's all clashing with each other.
[01:07:33.804 --> 01:07:39.869]  And then if you go out and loot and burn and attack and shoot people at checkpoints, well, you're good.
[01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:42.912]  But if somebody fights back when you attack them, they're bad.
[01:07:43.172 --> 01:07:47.616]  And so the police have done what I predicted.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:52.322]  They have done what I predicted.
[01:07:54.343 --> 01:07:55.304]  I would even say the police.
[01:07:55.384 --> 01:07:56.424]  It's not the police.
[01:07:57.025 --> 01:07:59.927]  The prosecutors, the bureaucrats, the people Soros has gotten in.
[01:07:59.947 --> 01:08:02.248]  They're going to try to make a big example of him.
[01:08:02.288 --> 01:08:04.630]  And who else said that last night at the RNC?
[01:08:05.070 --> 01:08:05.370]  The St.
[01:08:05.410 --> 01:08:16.438]  Louis homeowners, Mark and Patricia McCloskey, who also got SWAT teamed and charged for people at their house saying, we're going to kill you for simply having firearms out saying, get off our land.
[01:08:18.553 --> 01:08:26.896]  In Europe, in England, in the UK, if people are raping your wife, and you stab them in your own home, you get 50 years, they get one month.
[01:08:27.297 --> 01:08:28.057]  Those are real cases.
[01:08:28.917 --> 01:08:30.538]  And then, they sue you and win.
[01:08:31.878 --> 01:08:32.979]  Because these are criminals.
[01:08:33.439 --> 01:08:36.560]  I'm gonna play some of what they had to say last night, we're going right to your phone calls.
[01:08:37.661 --> 01:08:42.383]  Here is what they predicted just last night, and it was happening as they said it.
[01:08:42.423 --> 01:08:42.723]  Here it is.
[01:08:43.578 --> 01:08:44.279]  For the city of St.
[01:08:44.299 --> 01:08:44.639]  Louis.
[01:08:44.880 --> 01:08:45.761]  Protests in St.
[01:08:45.801 --> 01:08:46.762]  Louis turned violent.
[01:08:58.772 --> 01:09:01.916]  Mark McCloskey says he and his family have been threatened with violence.
[01:09:01.936 --> 01:09:05.961]  Under Missouri law, you have a right to defend your home and the lives of your family.
[01:09:06.041 --> 01:09:10.187]  A search warrant has been executed at the home of Mark and Patricia McCloskey.
[01:09:10.507 --> 01:09:13.471]  Husband and wife attorneys charged with pointing guns at protesters.
[01:09:13.771 --> 01:09:15.434]  They were simply trying to protect their home.
[01:09:16.394 --> 01:09:17.294]  Good evening, America.
[01:09:17.935 --> 01:09:19.595]  We are Mark and Patty McCloskey.
[01:09:20.016 --> 01:09:21.897]  We're speaking to you tonight from St.
[01:09:21.917 --> 01:09:29.140]  Louis, Missouri, where just weeks ago you may have seen us defending our home as a mob of protesters descended on our neighborhood.
[01:09:30.342 --> 01:09:40.291]  America is such a great country that not only do you have the right to own a gun and use it to defend yourself, but thousands of Americans will offer you free advice on how to use it.
[01:09:40.851 --> 01:09:42.473]  At least that's what we experienced.
[01:09:43.293 --> 01:09:49.939]  What you saw happen to us could just as easily happen to any of you who are watching from quiet neighborhoods around our country.
[01:09:50.339 --> 01:09:53.002]  And that's what we want to speak to you about tonight.
[01:09:54.229 --> 01:09:55.229]  That's exactly right.
[01:09:56.050 --> 01:10:19.181]  Whether it's the defunding of police, ending cash bail so criminals can be released back out on the streets the same day to riot again, or encouraging anarchy and chaos on our streets, it seems as if the Democrats no longer view the government's job as protecting honest citizens from criminals, but rather protecting criminals from honest citizens.
[01:10:20.290 --> 01:10:26.015]  Not a single person in the out-of-control mob you saw at our house was charged with a crime.
[01:10:27.136 --> 01:10:28.076]  But you know who was?
[01:10:29.097 --> 01:10:29.517]  We were.
[01:10:30.338 --> 01:10:35.482]  They've actually charged us with felonies for daring to defend our home.
[01:10:36.403 --> 01:10:38.084]  On top of that, consider this.
[01:10:38.685 --> 01:10:48.252]  The Marxist liberal activist leading the mob to our neighborhood stood outside our home with a bullhorn screaming, you can't stop the revolution.
[01:10:49.073 --> 01:10:56.537]  Just weeks later, that same Marxist activist won the Democrat nomination to hold a seat in the U.S.
[01:10:56.697 --> 01:10:57.857]  House of Representatives.
[01:10:58.458 --> 01:10:59.318]  In the city of St.
[01:10:59.358 --> 01:11:01.979]  Louis, that's the same as winning the general election.
[01:11:02.540 --> 01:11:09.123]  That Marxist revolutionary is now going to be the congresswoman from the 1st District of Missouri.
[01:11:10.638 --> 01:11:13.440]  These radicals are not content with marching in the streets.
[01:11:14.040 --> 01:11:16.101]  They want to walk the halls of Congress.
[01:11:16.461 --> 01:11:17.502]  They want to take over.
[01:11:17.982 --> 01:11:18.882]  They want power.
[01:11:19.303 --> 01:11:20.763]  This is Joe Biden's party.
[01:11:21.404 --> 01:11:25.386]  These are the people who will be in charge of your future and the future of your children.
[01:11:27.401 --> 01:11:31.603]  They're not satisfied with spreading the chaos and violence into our communities.
[01:11:32.063 --> 01:11:37.086]  They want to abolish the suburbs altogether by ending single-family home zoning.
[01:11:37.646 --> 01:11:44.190]  This forced rezoning would bring crime, lawlessness, and low-quality apartments into now-thriving suburban neighborhoods.
[01:11:44.890 --> 01:11:50.213]  President Trump smartly ended this government overreach, but Joe Biden wants to bring it back.
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:54.305]  These are the policies that are coming to a neighborhood near you.
[01:11:55.086 --> 01:12:02.637]  So make no mistake, no matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats' America.
[01:12:03.863 --> 01:12:15.289]  At this moment in history, if you stand up for yourself and for the values our country was founded on, the mob, spurred on by their allies in the media, will try to destroy you.
[01:12:16.190 --> 01:12:18.771]  You've seen us on your TV screens and Twitter feeds.
[01:12:19.292 --> 01:12:21.853]  You know that we're not the kind of people who back down.
[01:12:22.493 --> 01:12:24.675]  Thankfully, neither is Donald Trump.
[01:12:25.555 --> 01:12:32.797]  President Trump will defend the God-given right of every American to protect their homes and their families.
[01:12:33.437 --> 01:12:51.341]  But more than that, Trump's vision for America is a country where you have an opportunity to work hard and build the life you dream of with a job you love, with your children being educated in great schools, in a community where your family can play in the backyard without fear,
[01:12:52.381 --> 01:12:57.965]  Alright, their full video is at man.video and if you're a TV viewer you notice it says censoredbyjack.com
[01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:11.172]  Full video is also at newswars.com.
[01:13:11.533 --> 01:13:14.555]  Because banned.video is now completely banned on Twitter.
[01:13:14.635 --> 01:13:16.656]  The link cannot be sent out.
[01:13:16.696 --> 01:13:19.378]  It says dangerous, it's bad, it's verboten.
[01:13:19.438 --> 01:13:24.802]  But the whole site is cloned with its own URLs and the same videos.
[01:13:25.383 --> 01:13:29.766]  You can send out individual videos at censoredbyjack.com.
[01:13:30.327 --> 01:13:31.448]  Oh and I'm afraid
[01:13:32.248 --> 01:13:35.472]  If Jack censors that one, we have endless ones.
[01:13:36.052 --> 01:13:37.934]  So this is how it works in the resistance.
[01:13:38.315 --> 01:13:44.561]  It'll probably be daily now where we'll have what they call scraper sites to do this.
[01:13:44.621 --> 01:13:46.563]  But this is the fight we're involved in.
[01:13:47.725 --> 01:13:49.146]  This is what we're up to.
[01:13:49.166 --> 01:13:51.008]  And so
[01:13:52.568 --> 01:13:53.809]  You want to let them overpower you?
[01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:55.430]  They're counting on you being weak.
[01:13:55.450 --> 01:13:56.670]  They're counting on you lying down.
[01:13:56.690 --> 01:13:58.732]  They're counting on you not taking action.
[01:13:59.052 --> 01:14:02.914]  Tell everyone you know about the local radio station that carries the show.
[01:14:03.654 --> 01:14:08.837]  And tell friends and neighbors and family and random people, hey, go to BandDot Video.
[01:14:08.957 --> 01:14:10.879]  Find out what's really happening to America.
[01:14:11.219 --> 01:14:12.239]  Find out how to stop it.
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:18.443]  See the stuff they don't want you to know about COVID-19 and about Bill Gates and about all of it.
[01:14:19.624 --> 01:14:21.825]  See the raw footage of them shooting
[01:14:23.146 --> 01:14:31.111]  At Kyle Rittenhouse, and him running for his life to the police, and the police not helping him, and cowering in their armored leftist vehicles.
[01:14:31.371 --> 01:14:34.593]  I'm not saying all the police are bad, but come on, you knew this was coming from the bureaucrats.
[01:14:35.333 --> 01:14:39.756]  And then now, charging him with murder for defending himself.
[01:14:40.236 --> 01:14:41.417]  It's unbelievably disgusting.
[01:14:41.897 --> 01:14:45.379]  And please remember that things are only going to get crazier whether Trump wins or not.
[01:14:45.419 --> 01:14:46.880]  You need to get high quality, storable food.
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:49.501]  The globalists are locking things down for control.
[01:14:49.521 --> 01:14:52.101]  It's not the virus that's the reason you need the food.
[01:14:52.581 --> 01:14:54.222]  It's the depression it's causing.
[01:14:54.602 --> 01:14:56.422]  It's already causing major food chain disruptions.
[01:14:56.702 --> 01:14:57.823]  It's probably going to get a lot worse.
[01:15:08.092 --> 01:15:09.593]  All right, here's what I'm going to do to get to everybody.
[01:15:09.973 --> 01:15:10.693]  I'm not going to tell you.
[01:15:10.953 --> 01:15:11.673]  Thanks for calling.
[01:15:11.693 --> 01:15:13.294]  I appreciate you all calling.
[01:15:13.314 --> 01:15:13.854]  You're awesome.
[01:15:14.514 --> 01:15:15.274]  Please don't thank me.
[01:15:15.294 --> 01:15:16.375]  Let's talk about what's happening.
[01:15:17.035 --> 01:15:19.576]  The Democrats openly say they're going to cause secession.
[01:15:19.596 --> 01:15:21.917]  They're going to contest the election.
[01:15:22.217 --> 01:15:22.977]  They know they're losing.
[01:15:22.997 --> 01:15:24.898]  They're going to activate riots and burning everywhere.
[01:15:25.318 --> 01:15:31.900]  And the police are going to come arrest you if you defend yourself, even in your own home, in leftist areas like Kenosha, Wisconsin.
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:37.062]  Notice it's all happening in leftist areas, because the average cop may be a good person, but the bureaucrats, like the governor,
[01:15:37.782 --> 01:15:46.145]  When those police officers shot that guy in that confrontation that triggered this latest thing, they said, oh, the police in Wisconsin have a long history of indiscriminately murdering black people.
[01:15:46.285 --> 01:15:47.226]  It's just not true, folks.
[01:15:47.426 --> 01:15:48.386]  The statistics show it.
[01:15:48.846 --> 01:15:54.208]  In Wisconsin, you're more than double likely, statistically, to be shot if you're white than black, per capita.
[01:15:54.228 --> 01:15:56.009]  It's not because there's more whites.
[01:15:56.409 --> 01:15:57.350]  No, per capita.
[01:15:58.350 --> 01:16:02.151]  Per thousand white people, per thousand black people, you're more than twice as likely.
[01:16:02.432 --> 01:16:03.252]  It's BS!
[01:16:04.716 --> 01:16:05.776]  It's BS!
[01:16:06.417 --> 01:16:08.377]  In all these cases, they call the cops.
[01:16:08.757 --> 01:16:16.219]  Black people call the cops on some out-of-control individual, they get killed, attacking the police, and then all this crap happens.
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:18.560]  Unbelievable.
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:22.541]  17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse charged with murder for defending himself.
[01:16:23.321 --> 01:16:24.502]  Mack in Wisconsin.
[01:16:24.562 --> 01:16:25.822]  Mack, where are you in Wisconsin?
[01:16:26.322 --> 01:16:27.323]  And what's really going on?
[01:16:27.343 --> 01:16:28.363]  What do you think's happening next?
[01:16:29.335 --> 01:16:31.356]  Well, we got a mess here, Alex.
[01:16:31.416 --> 01:16:32.556]  No doubt about that.
[01:16:33.377 --> 01:16:37.118]  It's just seems like a minute by minute thing going on and it's pretty bad.
[01:16:37.178 --> 01:16:42.440]  But see, I got something here that I think you'd be really interested in hearing and think about what I'm saying, Alex.
[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:47.282]  Let's talk about the funding here of these anarchists, Antifa, BLM.
[01:16:48.462 --> 01:16:57.426]  What Trump needs to do is absolutely designate these guys and these anarchists as a terrorist group.
[01:16:58.126 --> 01:16:58.366]  Now,
[01:16:59.289 --> 01:17:22.445]  The people that are funding these terrorist groups, such as Soros and anybody else, but especially George Soros, if he's funding these terrorist groups, and they've been designated as a terrorist group, that means we should be able to go after him, our government, whatever, to go after him and arrest him and anybody else that is supporting these terrorist groups.
[01:17:22.806 --> 01:17:25.567]  Sir, that's what I was saying last hour, is that
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:39.551]  I even saw shots in Kenosha with them throwing Molotov cocktails at the vehicles, and the police just sit there and take it because they know that these Soros-funded DAs that are in almost control of almost every blue city literally will prosecute them.
[01:17:40.392 --> 01:17:47.298]  And so they paralyze the police, and the citizens go out, and then now the same prosecutors go after the citizens.
[01:17:47.338 --> 01:17:49.540]  So this is a serious situation.
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:49.921]  You're right.
[01:17:50.461 --> 01:18:03.466]  The funding by the Deep State, Soros is working for Obama, is doing this, and that's why it's hard to get folks to go after Obama, because he's a president, but he's not really a president, he's an enemy, put inside this country to bring it down.
[01:18:04.367 --> 01:18:05.167]  Yes, sir, Alex.
[01:18:05.587 --> 01:18:18.813]  You know, and if that money was coming from the terrorist organizations, monetarily being funded back into, say, who they support in our government, those on the left, the Libs, the Democrats,
[01:18:19.702 --> 01:18:27.329]  They would also be guilty of accepting money from a terrorist organization, too, which would be a treasonous... No, you're right.
[01:18:27.389 --> 01:18:29.291]  God bless you, sir, and that's what we're coming down to.
[01:18:29.591 --> 01:18:32.393]  Look, the Chi-Coms own most of Hollywood.
[01:18:32.433 --> 01:18:34.015]  They're funding all the civil unrest.
[01:18:34.555 --> 01:18:37.858]  The DNC, the Clinton Foundation, they're all guilty of treason.
[01:18:38.539 --> 01:18:39.620]  Open and shut, done.
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:43.563]  We just have to get Trump back in for a second term and heads are gonna roll.
[01:18:43.883 --> 01:18:44.344]  That's why
[01:18:45.612 --> 01:18:58.200]  Big Mike, Michael Obama, Obama's husband, said openly that vote and get in the streets and take action like your lives depend on it.
[01:18:58.560 --> 01:19:00.842]  Because their criminal operation depends on it.
[01:19:01.082 --> 01:19:02.203]  Because they're cornered rats.
[01:19:03.143 --> 01:19:05.485]  Mike of New Orleans, what do you think is going on?
[01:19:05.765 --> 01:19:06.465]  What's coming next?
[01:19:08.006 --> 01:19:09.127]  Alright, I'll tell you what's coming next.
[01:19:09.207 --> 01:19:14.671]  And the way you can tell what's coming next, Alex, I appreciate everything you do, is go back about
[01:19:15.717 --> 01:19:15.917]  What?
[01:19:16.397 --> 01:19:17.338]  Beginning of Obama.
[01:19:17.358 --> 01:19:17.998]  What did he say?
[01:19:18.078 --> 01:19:18.898]  Two big things.
[01:19:19.298 --> 01:19:23.580]  They didn't resonate very much with me or the American people, but definitely resonates now.
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:30.423]  One of the things that he said was, in five days we are five days away from fundamentally changing this country forever.
[01:19:30.623 --> 01:19:31.343]  Fundamentally.
[01:19:31.643 --> 01:19:32.523]  What are our fundamentals?
[01:19:32.563 --> 01:19:32.984]  The U.S.
[01:19:33.024 --> 01:19:35.425]  Constitution, Declaration of Independence, and Bill of Rights.
[01:19:35.885 --> 01:19:37.225]  Number two, what did he say?
[01:19:37.665 --> 01:19:38.426]  He also said, we
[01:19:39.608 --> 01:19:41.049]  Well, we don't need just a military.
[01:19:41.089 --> 01:19:46.494]  We need a national security force that's just as strong and just as powerful as our military.
[01:19:46.854 --> 01:19:54.060]  And that national security force, that's like your brown shirts of Germany, your black shirts of Italy, or your Red Guard from Mao Zedong.
[01:19:54.421 --> 01:19:55.922]  That is Black Lives Matter.
[01:19:56.242 --> 01:19:57.263]  That is Antifa.
[01:19:57.423 --> 01:19:59.425]  And Black Lives Matter, when he was still president,
[01:20:00.126 --> 01:20:00.687]  I don't
[01:20:20.062 --> 01:20:22.584]  So they're Marxist-Leninists that follow a Mao blueprint.
[01:20:23.064 --> 01:20:30.551]  All three founders of Black Lives Matter say we are Maoist and this is their plan to end the family, to fundamentally transform America.
[01:20:30.932 --> 01:20:32.253]  That's what Antifa is as well.
[01:20:32.793 --> 01:20:35.276]  Almost all of them are devil-worshipping pedophiles.
[01:20:35.916 --> 01:20:37.717]  Antifa, we've tracked them, we've traced them.
[01:20:37.978 --> 01:20:39.218]  You go look at their pages, everything.
[01:20:39.819 --> 01:20:45.343]  They like sex with kids, they like the devil, they don't like to bathe, they like all sorts of degeneracy.
[01:20:45.723 --> 01:20:49.205]  That's who they are, the scum of the planet.
[01:20:49.466 --> 01:20:50.166]  God bless you, Mike.
[01:20:50.426 --> 01:20:58.432]  Here is Obama, just months before he got elected in 2008, talking about the domestic force, which they've now launched against us.
[01:21:00.939 --> 01:21:08.083]  We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set.
[01:21:08.883 --> 01:21:15.927]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[01:21:22.964 --> 01:21:35.410]  They were planning, once Hillary got in, to use every questionable police shooting in red areas to take over government, take over the police, and have all their prosecutors in, to then basically arrest everybody who's a Republican on trumped-up charges.
[01:21:35.930 --> 01:21:39.912]  They're still moving ahead with that plan, with Letitia James and others, out of their jurisdictions.
[01:21:41.072 --> 01:21:47.215]  If they get the executive, things go to a physical civil war, no matter what, because they're going to come for everybody.
[01:21:48.757 --> 01:21:51.378]  Mike in Florida says no election in 2020, Civil War coming.
[01:21:52.058 --> 01:21:53.558]  Yeah, that is the Democrat plan.
[01:21:53.878 --> 01:21:58.319]  They plan to have so much rioting, so much whatever, that they are going to quote, drag it out forever.
[01:21:58.599 --> 01:21:59.539]  They know they're going to lose.
[01:21:59.759 --> 01:22:01.660]  They're going to challenge it and activate their hordes.
[01:22:01.960 --> 01:22:02.600]  What's coming next?
[01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:04.220]  What does President Trump need to do, Steve?
[01:22:06.381 --> 01:22:07.461]  Yeah, hey Alex.
[01:22:08.221 --> 01:22:14.102]  You know, years ago you put out, and I want to make this call the same way, you put out a ringtone.
[01:22:14.662 --> 01:22:17.303]  People could get on their phone and say, Mayday, Mayday, Mayday.
[01:22:17.964 --> 01:22:20.928]  Well, I want to make this a mayday, okay?
[01:22:21.488 --> 01:22:33.984]  Here's the thing, and this is my personal analysis, I've been following everything for years, you know, TechSmars, the John Birch Society, you came along, and here's the thing, this is my take on this.
[01:22:34.838 --> 01:22:38.161]  We are not going to have an election.
[01:22:38.361 --> 01:22:47.648]  I've been watching the Republican National Convention, I've been listening to what you are saying and Mike Adams and others, but here's the bottom line.
[01:22:48.228 --> 01:22:53.392]  This whole situation we're now facing in America did not start with Obama and Hillary.
[01:22:53.792 --> 01:22:59.717]  This goes all the way back to Adam Weishaupt and the Illuminati and then the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.
[01:23:01.758 --> 01:23:15.515]  The reason the Communists, the Marxists, conquered Russia and Eastern Black and then the Far East countries like China was to set up a base for their main target, which was the United States of America.
[01:23:15.535 --> 01:23:19.320]  And when you study Marx, he was a hardcore Satanist.
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:36.290]  These people hate Jesus Christ, they hate the Bible, and we are the Christian West, and they knew that the way to bring this down was they were going to have to attack us from our spiritual, moral base by infiltrating the churches and causing total unrest.
[01:23:36.630 --> 01:23:42.113]  So what I'm saying is this, Alex, we have a situation now, and this is what people aren't counting on.
[01:23:42.133 --> 01:23:44.654]  The Muslim Brotherhood and the head of care
[01:23:45.715 --> 01:23:48.796]  Are backing Antifa and Black Lives Matter.
[01:23:48.816 --> 01:23:50.157]  They've said that publicly.
[01:23:50.497 --> 01:23:57.360]  The Chi-Coms are giving weapons to these renegade groups, funded by the corporations and Soros.
[01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:58.620]  If you look all that up.
[01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:02.962]  And the thing is, is that my biggest concern is not the economy.
[01:24:03.282 --> 01:24:05.183]  It's not how the election is going to go.
[01:24:05.603 --> 01:24:11.345]  These people, I told people years ago, we are going to have bloody war in the streets of America.
[01:24:11.625 --> 01:24:12.926]  They're going to start in the cities.
[01:24:13.326 --> 01:24:14.987]  And I had no idea how it was going to go.
[01:24:15.067 --> 01:24:15.968]  Now I'm seeing it.
[01:24:16.668 --> 01:24:20.891]  Start in the cities, fan out to the suburbs, and then hit the rural areas.
[01:24:21.552 --> 01:24:28.656]  And Alex, when it gets to the rural areas, all the people that have the weapons, that's when the real war is going to start.
[01:24:29.057 --> 01:24:30.678]  Sir, I totally agree.
[01:24:30.778 --> 01:24:31.578]  I totally agree.
[01:24:31.618 --> 01:24:32.079]  That's what I...
[01:24:32.859 --> 01:24:37.684]  A few weeks ago I said, if the country falls, then the Bolsheviks are going to move out towards the country.
[01:24:37.704 --> 01:24:38.725]  It will take them months to get out there.
[01:24:38.745 --> 01:24:43.049]  They're going to try to starve people out, shut the roads down, use COVID as the excuse along with other things.
[01:24:43.509 --> 01:24:57.382]  And then if your local town capitulates to them, because they're already putting their communist agents in all the small towns, if you capitulate and if you don't remove those agents immediately when Washington falls, then you're going to lose half the battle because they've got targeting agents in your area.
[01:24:57.702 --> 01:25:01.944]  So everybody wants to- and then the media spun it that I was saying offensive attacks start killing people.
[01:25:02.004 --> 01:25:07.887]  No, I said you better study the Bullshit Revolution or the Malice Revolution and their attack profile and be ready for them.
[01:25:07.907 --> 01:25:08.788]  That's what I'm telling you.
[01:25:08.808 --> 01:25:09.188]  They're coming.
[01:25:09.468 --> 01:25:11.069]  And you bow down to them.
[01:25:11.249 --> 01:25:14.991]  They're still going to rape you, take your farm, kill your wife, kill your daughters, rape you.
[01:25:15.271 --> 01:25:16.612]  Because that's what they want to do.
[01:25:16.712 --> 01:25:17.092]  They're coming.
[01:25:17.633 --> 01:25:18.293]  God bless you, sir.
[01:25:18.933 --> 01:25:19.434]  Absolutely.
[01:25:19.494 --> 01:25:19.854]  It's on.
[01:25:20.434 --> 01:25:23.816]  You're about to see the fall of the United States of America, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:25:25.066 --> 01:25:30.170]  I mean, they did it in China, they did it in Russia, they did it in Ukraine, they did it all over the world, and they're running the same program here.
[01:25:31.211 --> 01:25:34.434]  Except now, the operating system's out in the open, just like the French Revolution.
[01:25:35.135 --> 01:25:36.356]  God help us, God help us.
[01:25:36.396 --> 01:25:37.357]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[01:25:39.426 --> 01:25:47.111]  Ali Alexander, who is a Texan up in Dallas, has been doing a really great job of political analysis the last few months.
[01:25:47.132 --> 01:25:50.374]  I've been having him on, so I thought, why not get him in studio today?
[01:25:50.394 --> 01:25:51.875]  So he drove down here last night from Dallas.
[01:25:52.335 --> 01:25:53.596]  He's coming in for the rest of the hour.
[01:25:53.636 --> 01:25:54.697]  Then Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[01:25:54.717 --> 01:25:55.758]  We're going to get to all your calls.
[01:25:55.778 --> 01:25:59.640]  You know, that was a really scary caller we had last segment, but that's really what this is.
[01:26:01.021 --> 01:26:02.242]  Everything else was a beta test.
[01:26:02.322 --> 01:26:03.683]  Everything else was just preparation.
[01:26:04.083 --> 01:26:08.727]  The whole media, the corporations, Hollywood, foreign governments, the big banks,
[01:26:10.342 --> 01:26:17.909]  And there are loyalists in the military and a lot of the police and general citizens, but we are outnumbered in the power structure.
[01:26:18.769 --> 01:26:24.014]  And as long as we're killing each other in the streets with these idiot low-level commies, the enemy's gonna win.
[01:26:24.034 --> 01:26:26.276]  I'm not calling for any offensive violence.
[01:26:26.936 --> 01:26:30.940]  I'm just saying that Trump needs to go after the leadership of these operations.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:37.746]  You know, and instead, you've got the FBI running around, indicting Steve Bannon over keeping money,
[01:26:38.933 --> 01:26:40.414]  A few hundred thousand dollars for the wall.
[01:26:41.414 --> 01:26:43.495]  And I don't even like Steve Bannon, but this is a joke, folks.
[01:26:43.515 --> 01:26:44.075]  This is a joke.
[01:26:44.115 --> 01:26:46.436]  Hillary steals billions of dollars from her foundation.
[01:26:46.816 --> 01:26:47.696]  Nothing's happening to her.
[01:26:47.716 --> 01:26:50.497]  Only because Bannon worked with Trump.
[01:26:51.197 --> 01:26:56.099]  Even though Bannon worked to bring globalists in on Trump, was a double dealer, he still is burned for this.
[01:26:56.999 --> 01:26:58.140]  These people are just horrible.
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:03.862]  And people are having to decide the federal government which side they're on.
[01:27:04.062 --> 01:27:07.023]  And all of the smug Ivy League idiots
[01:27:08.186 --> 01:27:09.446]  That are bringing this evil in.
[01:27:09.466 --> 01:27:11.567]  You're all going to be removed by the globalists when they take power.
[01:27:13.847 --> 01:27:15.748]  They're going to totally change the Justice Department.
[01:27:15.828 --> 01:27:17.888]  None of the traitors are even going to be kept there.
[01:27:17.908 --> 01:27:19.289]  There are going to be even worse people.
[01:27:20.089 --> 01:27:24.790]  And you look at Peter Strzok and the arrogance he has in those videos and testimony.
[01:27:24.810 --> 01:27:25.670]  These are crazy people.
[01:27:27.231 --> 01:27:29.011]  They really fundamentally hate this country.
[01:27:29.871 --> 01:27:31.452]  And God help us, that's all I can say.
[01:27:35.173 --> 01:27:35.933]  Let's go ahead and
[01:27:37.639 --> 01:27:38.700]  Take another call here.
[01:27:38.720 --> 01:27:42.302]  Let's go ahead and talk to Kenny in Ohio.
[01:27:42.342 --> 01:27:42.983]  Kenny, you're on the air.
[01:27:43.003 --> 01:27:45.605]  How you doing, Alex?
[01:27:45.945 --> 01:27:51.449]  Well, first of all, I want to say that you're speaking on being prepared for people and get guns and ammunition.
[01:27:51.989 --> 01:27:52.690]  I sell guns.
[01:27:52.950 --> 01:27:54.751]  There's no guns and ammunition to be had.
[01:27:55.412 --> 01:27:58.094]  Everybody, the time to get it has already been passed.
[01:27:58.594 --> 01:28:01.416]  I mean, stuff is matriculating in, but it's pretty much over.
[01:28:03.837 --> 01:28:11.683]  Well, you can get a shotgun, you can get shotgun shells, you can get a deer rifle and a three power scope.
[01:28:12.284 --> 01:28:14.425]  I mean, all you need to do is get something basic.
[01:28:16.187 --> 01:28:17.708]  But even the basic stuff is gone.
[01:28:17.728 --> 01:28:19.729]  I mean, defensive shotguns, forget about it.
[01:28:20.049 --> 01:28:23.572]  Pistols, rifles, 5.56 ammunition, it's all gone.
[01:28:24.673 --> 01:28:28.616]  I mean, you say that people get deer rifles, but people don't know the difference.
[01:28:29.397 --> 01:28:30.257]  I mean, they're not going to know.
[01:28:31.556 --> 01:28:34.398]  Being prepared for that's the good stuff that's double that buck.
[01:28:34.778 --> 01:28:36.439]  I mean it's hardly hardly coming in.
[01:28:36.959 --> 01:28:41.062]  Ammunition is going to be back until probably about looking about February or March.
[01:28:41.582 --> 01:28:47.246]  A lot of preparedness for getting ammunition in bulk and being able to train and use it is kind of past right now.
[01:28:48.561 --> 01:28:49.421]  Well, we're all doomed then.
[01:28:50.402 --> 01:28:58.166]  No, seriously, I mean, anybody can take a shotgun out in the backyard in the country and shoot coffee cans at 20 yards and learn how to shoot in 5 minutes.
[01:28:58.206 --> 01:29:01.487]  I mean, it's pretty... That's why women are taught to be scared of guns.
[01:29:01.887 --> 01:29:11.352]  I can take any woman out of Hollywood, anywhere out, Mike Judge has done this with me quite a few times, and these women are shooting bullseye at 100 yards, you know, with a M4 in like 3 minutes.
[01:29:12.964 --> 01:29:15.444]  But I hear you that there are supply problems and all the rest of it.
[01:29:16.765 --> 01:29:19.065]  Do you have a take on the Civil War and what's coming next?
[01:29:20.185 --> 01:29:21.326]  Yeah, it's coming.
[01:29:21.386 --> 01:29:22.046]  It's already here.
[01:29:22.306 --> 01:29:23.686]  I mean, you see it all the time.
[01:29:24.026 --> 01:29:31.708]  But now, you're going to be deterred to even defend yourself, especially in the leftist cities, if this stuff keeps happening where you defend yourself and you actually shoot someone.
[01:29:31.728 --> 01:29:34.768]  Sure, well it's better to be tried by nine than carried by six.
[01:29:34.788 --> 01:29:37.189]  That's exactly what I was going to say.
[01:29:37.309 --> 01:29:37.869]  Exactly.
[01:29:38.629 --> 01:29:39.109]  Exactly.
[01:29:41.089 --> 01:29:45.310]  So anybody tries to break in my house or attack me, I'm going to defend myself, so that's that.
[01:29:45.450 --> 01:29:59.454]  And believe me, all I'm saying is they want to send their hordes of welfare zombies and meth-head devil worshippers out and just overwhelm and bring things down while the globalists sit in their warrens.
[01:29:59.594 --> 01:30:01.034]  All I'm saying is that
[01:30:02.933 --> 01:30:04.455]  Why is anybody going to put up with this?
[01:30:04.615 --> 01:30:05.937]  I mean, that's all I'm saying.
[01:30:06.237 --> 01:30:06.858]  God bless you, sir.
[01:30:06.898 --> 01:30:07.618]  I appreciate your call.
[01:30:08.399 --> 01:30:11.183]  Yeah, we're two minutes to midnight, folks.
[01:30:11.803 --> 01:30:12.664]  People better get prepared.
[01:30:12.684 --> 01:30:13.585]  I'm talking about storable food.
[01:30:13.645 --> 01:30:14.086]  We have it.
[01:30:14.426 --> 01:30:15.347]  We can get it to you now.
[01:30:15.367 --> 01:30:17.530]  It's still time to get it to you before everything hits.
[01:30:26.305 --> 01:30:32.910]  It's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:35.292]  You better believe you got one!
[01:30:37.434 --> 01:30:42.518]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:31:00.938 --> 01:31:03.739]  It was actually probably the happiest year of my life.
[01:31:04.559 --> 01:31:06.739]  That year of German occupation.
[01:31:06.799 --> 01:31:08.840]  For me it was a very positive experience.
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:18.221]  It's a strange thing, you know, because you see incredible suffering around you and in fact you are in considerable danger yourself.
[01:31:19.241 --> 01:31:21.762]  But you're 14 years old and you don't believe.
[01:31:22.652 --> 01:31:24.772]  That it can actually touch you.
[01:31:24.833 --> 01:31:27.933]  You have a belief in yourself, your belief in your father.
[01:31:28.513 --> 01:31:32.374]  It's a very happy-making, exhilarating experience.
[01:31:32.854 --> 01:31:43.897]  While hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were being shipped off to the death camps, George Soros accompanied his phony godfather on his appointed rounds, confiscating property from the Jews.
[01:31:44.477 --> 01:31:49.258]  These are pictures from 1944 of what happened to George Soros' friends and neighbors.
[01:31:50.018 --> 01:31:50.318]  Europe
[01:31:51.254 --> 01:31:51.414]  I don't
[01:32:04.850 --> 01:32:06.913]  Lots of people get shipped off to the death camps.
[01:32:22.154 --> 01:32:23.055]  One is threatened.
[01:32:23.495 --> 01:32:25.496]  It was a tremendous threat of evil.
[01:32:25.617 --> 01:32:28.438]  I mean, it was a very personal experience of evil.
[01:32:28.899 --> 01:32:37.384]  My understanding is that you went out with this protector of yours, who swore that you were his adopted godson.
[01:32:37.424 --> 01:32:37.685]  Yes.
[01:32:38.565 --> 01:32:41.968]  Went out, in fact, and helped in the confiscation of property from the Jews.
[01:32:42.128 --> 01:32:42.528]  That's right.
[01:32:44.995 --> 01:32:53.408]  That sounds like an experience that would send lots of people to the psychiatric couch for many, many years.
[01:32:54.349 --> 01:32:55.170]  Was it difficult?
[01:32:57.514 --> 01:32:58.255]  Not at all.
[01:32:58.315 --> 01:32:58.796]  Not at all.
[01:33:00.478 --> 01:33:10.041]  Maybe as a child you don't see the connection, but it created no problem at all.
[01:33:10.121 --> 01:33:11.021]  No feeling of guilt?
[01:33:11.401 --> 01:33:11.601]  No.
[01:33:11.961 --> 01:33:20.104]  For example, that I'm Jewish and here I am watching these people go, I could just as easily be there, I should be there.
[01:33:20.524 --> 01:33:20.964]  None of that?
[01:33:21.744 --> 01:33:30.689]  Well, of course I could be on the other side, or I could be the one from whom the thing is being taken away.
[01:33:34.792 --> 01:33:41.076]  But there was no sense that I shouldn't be there, because that was...
[01:33:45.589 --> 01:33:58.779]  Well, actually, funny way, it's just like in markets, that if I weren't there, of course I wasn't doing it, but somebody else would be taking it away anyhow.
[01:33:59.079 --> 01:34:03.763]  Whether I was there or not, I was only a spectator, the property was being taken away.
[01:34:04.824 --> 01:34:08.387]  So I had no role in taking away that property.
[01:34:09.307 --> 01:34:10.588]  So I had no sense of guilt.
[01:34:11.049 --> 01:34:11.729]  Are you religious?
[01:34:12.570 --> 01:34:12.710]  No.
[01:34:14.571 --> 01:34:15.232]  Do you believe in God?
[01:34:23.669 --> 01:34:26.671]  All right, we've been having Ali Alexander on quite a bit in the last month.
[01:34:26.711 --> 01:34:28.491]  He's really been on fire with his analysis.
[01:34:28.552 --> 01:34:29.572]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:34:30.032 --> 01:34:31.293]  We'll continue with your phone calls.
[01:34:31.353 --> 01:34:35.295]  Michael, Jeff, Joe, Semi, Chris, Ryan, Corey, and others.
[01:34:35.775 --> 01:34:38.837]  When we do go to calls next, it'll be at the bottom of the hour, so please hold.
[01:34:39.457 --> 01:34:40.658]  Joe will be first in Wisconsin.
[01:34:40.678 --> 01:34:43.560]  He says we're going into total U.N.
[01:34:43.620 --> 01:34:44.020]  control.
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:50.824]  And that's what the Strong Cities Initiative is, of having the police demonize, the whole government demonize, and then the U.N.
[01:34:50.904 --> 01:34:53.606]  comes in through the Justice Department and takes control.
[01:34:53.646 --> 01:34:57.348]  That was an official program Obama launched the last two years of his presidency.
[01:34:57.868 --> 01:34:58.349]  Now the U.N.
[01:34:58.389 --> 01:34:59.910]  tells us what to do with our medical stuff.
[01:35:00.939 --> 01:35:05.600]  Now the UN is in control of what medical doctors can say about COVID-19.
[01:35:05.660 --> 01:35:06.801]  We're under world government.
[01:35:06.861 --> 01:35:13.263]  Now the head of the World Health Organization said two days ago, three days ago, you must not have vaccine nationalism.
[01:35:13.563 --> 01:35:17.604]  If a country tries to refuse the vaccine, they should be blockaded.
[01:35:17.664 --> 01:35:18.804]  They should be put under sanctions.
[01:35:19.864 --> 01:35:21.905]  Just like they're Iran or something.
[01:35:22.445 --> 01:35:23.886]  So this is very dangerous.
[01:35:23.906 --> 01:35:25.166]  You wake up, you're in the world government.
[01:35:25.913 --> 01:35:28.435]  Political analyst Ali Alexander is here with us riding shotgun.
[01:35:28.475 --> 01:35:29.796]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[01:35:30.076 --> 01:35:34.179]  Don't forget, weeknights now, 7 to 9, commercial light.
[01:35:34.199 --> 01:35:35.900]  There's only six minutes of ads for local stations.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:36.780]  We don't have any commercials.
[01:35:37.261 --> 01:35:47.408]  We have Election Countdown, Taking Back America with Deanna Lorraine, myself, Owen Schroer, Savannah Hernandez, Harrison Smith, and others.
[01:35:48.248 --> 01:35:48.628]  Yeah, I don't know.
[01:36:06.724 --> 01:36:08.465]  And made incredibly draconian statements.
[01:36:08.485 --> 01:36:09.586]  We're going to play that again in a moment.
[01:36:09.926 --> 01:36:12.427]  Saying that they're going to contest the election no matter what.
[01:36:12.467 --> 01:36:13.408]  They know they're going to lose.
[01:36:13.868 --> 01:36:15.269]  This is so incredibly dangerous.
[01:36:15.329 --> 01:36:16.069]  I cannot describe it.
[01:36:16.549 --> 01:36:19.791]  And that they're then going to use that to have the blue cities and states secede.
[01:36:20.131 --> 01:36:23.293]  Exactly what Ali Alexander was on with us three weeks ago.
[01:36:23.773 --> 01:36:26.534]  Warning of now it's out in the open.
[01:36:26.554 --> 01:36:30.076]  But I wanted to play that George Soros clip of him on NPR in 60 Minutes.
[01:36:31.644 --> 01:36:40.032]  Saying the most exhilarating time of his life was under Nazi occupation when he was helping go around as a 14-year-old Jew and finding where Jews were hidden.
[01:36:40.092 --> 01:36:44.036]  So he's trying to go find Anne Franks, who the Nazis called those bloodhounds.
[01:36:44.636 --> 01:36:46.818]  And they like to use teenagers that didn't look threatening.
[01:36:46.858 --> 01:36:48.140]  They could figure out where things were.
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:36:50.201]  They could talk to other Jews and find out.
[01:36:50.822 --> 01:36:55.106]  And then they would also suck the money out of the Jews for a while, saying they'd protect them.
[01:36:55.126 --> 01:36:57.548]  And then finally, once they got all their money, they'd call the Nazis.
[01:36:57.568 --> 01:36:58.529]  The Nazis would come take them.
[01:36:58.929 --> 01:37:01.031]  So he's one of the most horrible people ever.
[01:37:01.471 --> 01:37:02.572]  That's why he funds revolutions.
[01:37:02.592 --> 01:37:03.933]  That's why he wants to have one here.
[01:37:04.273 --> 01:37:10.279]  He said it's the happiest time of his life robbing Jews, sending them to death camps in Eastern Europe.
[01:37:10.619 --> 01:37:11.680]  Now, you just heard him say that.
[01:37:11.740 --> 01:37:13.321]  So you ask, why does he do it?
[01:37:13.381 --> 01:37:15.103]  Well, it was exhilarating.
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:16.420]  Yeah.
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:32.141]  Yeah, it's absolutely true.
[01:37:32.221 --> 01:37:35.644]  And Alex Soros, his son, was actually running his fund two years ago.
[01:37:35.704 --> 01:37:38.367]  George Soros took back control of that fund.
[01:37:38.427 --> 01:37:40.689]  It was an unprecedented move for a family office.
[01:37:41.170 --> 01:37:44.393]  And Alex Soros was pushing Kamala Harris for the VP pick.
[01:37:44.673 --> 01:37:48.677]  And they're funding the Black Lives Matter riots and the bailout funds.
[01:37:48.898 --> 01:37:52.021]  And this is kind of a Soros-controlled election right now.
[01:37:52.521 --> 01:37:56.884]  Imagine if you said or I said, the happiest time of my life was rounding up Jews.
[01:37:57.004 --> 01:37:58.285]  If I didn't do it, somebody else would.
[01:37:58.345 --> 01:37:59.646]  That sociopathic statement.
[01:37:59.666 --> 01:38:04.470]  Well, I mean, if I didn't work with the Nazis, no, if you got up and fought them, they would have got their ass kicked.
[01:38:05.170 --> 01:38:11.334]  If somebody said, hey, we're going to kill you if you don't help round up, say, Chinese people or black people or white people, I'd say, I'm going to fight you.
[01:38:11.635 --> 01:38:12.215]  But not him.
[01:38:12.235 --> 01:38:13.576]  And he didn't just do it.
[01:38:13.616 --> 01:38:14.557]  He said he loved it.
[01:38:15.017 --> 01:38:19.899]  He loved it, and it showed that the commodity he was most interested in was actually power.
[01:38:20.399 --> 01:38:27.721]  Money is a pathway to power, and then he just compounds it to build more money, to build more power, and it's all about his agenda.
[01:38:27.981 --> 01:38:29.322]  This guy does not want to die.
[01:38:29.342 --> 01:38:33.383]  I say, Alex, we're at war with the people who claim that they want a quality of life.
[01:38:33.423 --> 01:38:39.805]  These depopulators, the Bill Gates, they want to depopulate the earth and then raise the quality of life for those left.
[01:38:40.811 --> 01:38:41.251]  Well, that's right.
[01:38:41.351 --> 01:38:53.599]  In fact, they say they want a neo-feudalistic thing where they have giant million-acre ranches with all these clones for organs and all the high-tech, but that they reduce us down to a manageable 500 million.
[01:38:53.639 --> 01:38:55.040]  That's official UN doctrine.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:55.840]  Yeah.
[01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:58.982]  And you have to wonder, you know, they say we're going to top off at 10 billion.
[01:38:59.222 --> 01:39:01.284]  We'll come back down to 7 billion.
[01:39:01.564 --> 01:39:06.067]  And you know, biblical prophecy says that a third of the world is going to die in some tragedy.
[01:39:06.107 --> 01:39:06.947]  That's revelation.
[01:39:07.007 --> 01:39:09.549]  So you really have to wonder, how close are we?
[01:39:11.178 --> 01:39:11.938]  I totally agree.
[01:39:12.078 --> 01:39:13.919]  What do you want to cover while you're here with us today?
[01:39:13.939 --> 01:39:16.639]  You're going to be on with The War Room tonight.
[01:39:16.799 --> 01:39:18.240]  I'd love it if you want to do even more.
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:20.080]  Come on to the nighttime show as well.
[01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:21.200]  What are the topics you want to hit?
[01:39:21.541 --> 01:39:24.221]  Yeah, I think that we got to talk about Trump's pathway to victory.
[01:39:24.281 --> 01:39:33.823]  I think that, you know, we talked about this the other day, but when Trump leans into the message that your viewers want to hear, when he leans into the message that MAGA Twitter wants to hear, he wins.
[01:39:33.843 --> 01:39:35.864]  He's turned around in the Rust Belt.
[01:39:35.884 --> 01:39:37.244]  He's turned around in the Midwest.
[01:39:37.624 --> 01:39:39.785]  He's, I think he's now two points ahead.
[01:39:40.425 --> 01:39:44.727]  And just a month ago we were saying, he's got to get hardcore again, he did it!
[01:39:45.048 --> 01:39:47.149]  Yeah, and you know, people said we were crazy.
[01:39:47.189 --> 01:39:52.351]  People were saying, oh, you know, Mike Cernovich is a downer, Ali Alexander is a downer, Alex Jones is a downer.
[01:39:52.671 --> 01:39:56.013]  Well, Trump was actually five or six points down and people didn't believe it.
[01:39:56.313 --> 01:40:01.276]  When we saw the men tick up in the poll, when we saw Christians tick up in the poll, he's back and fighting.
[01:40:01.316 --> 01:40:09.360]  And so now, you know, Trump is headed for an electoral victory, but he can really actually push this into a landslide if he decides to run against the riots.
[01:40:09.581 --> 01:40:10.063]  Absolutely.
[01:40:10.083 --> 01:40:11.289]  And it's not about us saying we were right.
[01:40:12.214 --> 01:40:13.320]  We know the right thing to do.
[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:13.843]  We'll be right back.
[01:40:15.586 --> 01:40:19.128]  Allie Alexander had been on the show quite a bit during the last election, a little bit after.
[01:40:19.228 --> 01:40:24.290]  He was a good guest, smart, but kind of mainline Republican Party, populist.
[01:40:25.150 --> 01:40:30.112]  I'd say cutting edge Republican Party, but still pretty established for us.
[01:40:30.132 --> 01:40:32.453]  But then, I started seeing you a few months ago in interviews.
[01:40:32.493 --> 01:40:36.695]  You were on fire, saying stuff more eloquent than I would say, and really cutting to the heart.
[01:40:37.355 --> 01:40:38.036]  What happened?
[01:40:38.536 --> 01:40:40.737]  And then you were just going off about world government.
[01:40:41.894 --> 01:40:47.531]  Tower of Babel and why they won it, and it was really first-rate intel.
[01:40:47.952 --> 01:40:49.437]  So how did you change?
[01:40:50.569 --> 01:40:51.429]  New Year's happened.
[01:40:51.949 --> 01:41:00.711]  New Year's I was with somebody who is very spiritual and somebody who looked to me for advice, and I wasn't attending church.
[01:41:01.031 --> 01:41:03.152]  It'd been a decade since I regularly attended church.
[01:41:03.172 --> 01:41:07.173]  You know, right after high school I had actually gone to Bible college, so I'd been away for a while.
[01:41:07.833 --> 01:41:12.534]  And I thought, well, if I'm not edifying myself properly, how am I going to edify this guy?
[01:41:12.554 --> 01:41:16.335]  And this guy's edifying, you know, hundreds of millions of people.
[01:41:16.855 --> 01:41:21.679]  And I said, okay, I came back to Texas, started going back to church, and then the pandemic hit.
[01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:24.782]  And it felt like an indictment on the church.
[01:41:24.862 --> 01:41:26.764]  It felt like an indictment on conservatives.
[01:41:26.804 --> 01:41:28.425]  It felt like an indictment on Republicans.
[01:41:28.466 --> 01:41:31.768]  I was like, okay, these are enemies, but maybe there's something I'm missing.
[01:41:32.089 --> 01:41:39.816]  And when I did this deep dive into, you know, some touchy issues, Freemasonry and its war with the Catholic Church, I discovered that
[01:41:40.336 --> 01:41:48.724]  Wow, all of these events that we talk about in a political sense, you could actually, there's a spiritual war going on, and there's more than a spiritual war going on.
[01:41:48.804 --> 01:41:54.129]  So you never left God, but you kind of got busy and forgot a little bit, but now you're standing closer to the fire.
[01:41:54.549 --> 01:41:59.894]  It's the spirit of evil so strong, the spirit of good is strong again, and you just got back with God.
[01:42:00.214 --> 01:42:05.615]  Yeah, we need to talk about the temporal history of the metaphysical things.
[01:42:05.655 --> 01:42:17.177]  You know, church, you know, the Catholics believe that mass, you know, and we evangelicals just call it church, you know, on Sunday, the Sabbath, is a sacrament, and that it keeps a portal to hell closed.
[01:42:17.998 --> 01:42:20.998]  And, you know, the Catholics have a prophecy about the Restrainer.
[01:42:21.478 --> 01:42:26.279]  And the Satanists are everywhere, burning churches all over the world right now, and they get caught, they go, oh, Satan told me to do it.
[01:42:26.579 --> 01:42:27.080]  Right.
[01:42:27.100 --> 01:42:29.380]  Because Satan can't come and give me power until I do it.
[01:42:29.580 --> 01:42:30.340]  Right, exactly.
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:37.483]  So the demons are roaming while Satan is bound and he has his servants and they call themselves servants of light, right?
[01:42:37.863 --> 01:42:41.345]  The Bible warns of this in Matthew and in Mark and in Revelation.
[01:42:41.385 --> 01:42:49.348]  So we have to watch out when people use this obscure language and darkness and light and darkness and light because it might not be Jesus Christ light.
[01:42:49.648 --> 01:42:52.489]  And so I mean I don't want to get super religious or super spiritual.
[01:42:52.549 --> 01:42:54.650]  Sure, the devil masquerades as an angel of light.
[01:42:54.910 --> 01:42:56.932]  Exactly, that's his old title, Alex, right?
[01:42:56.972 --> 01:42:58.513]  He was Lucifer.
[01:42:58.753 --> 01:43:01.935]  Right, and now he is Satan, and now he is the devil.
[01:43:01.976 --> 01:43:05.538]  He's no longer Lucifer, and we shouldn't use those terms interchangeably.
[01:43:05.558 --> 01:43:08.681]  That's right, the devil worshippers and Luciferians, they still say he's Lucifer.
[01:43:08.701 --> 01:43:10.582]  They still say he has that office.
[01:43:10.602 --> 01:43:11.703]  He knows he's not in that office anymore.
[01:43:11.883 --> 01:43:22.312]  Right, and what Lucifer wanted, and a lot of people forget this about his rebellion against God, was Lucifer thought, because he engaged the ego, that he was doing God a favor.
[01:43:22.352 --> 01:43:25.655]  He said, you know, let my light, let you be glorified by my light.
[01:43:25.996 --> 01:43:32.822]  And he still wanted to serve God, but he wanted to serve him through his ego, and that's when God cast him down to earth and spread this chaos.
[01:43:34.704 --> 01:43:36.907]  You know, we're living out that history again.
[01:43:36.927 --> 01:43:43.656]  And I just, I was like, I can't talk about this with just lockdowns and shutdowns and medicine and masks.
[01:43:43.976 --> 01:43:45.398]  I have to say what is happening.
[01:43:45.539 --> 01:43:46.700]  We have weak pastors.
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:47.982]  We have weak Republicans.
[01:43:48.282 --> 01:43:49.724]  We don't have real conservatives.
[01:43:50.425 --> 01:43:53.608]  And we are suffering because we won't take the truth to the people.
[01:43:53.668 --> 01:43:54.149]  That's it.
[01:43:54.469 --> 01:44:01.556]  It only takes people who are willing to take the truth to the people for the people to rise up against their oppressors and then the oppressors will disappear.
[01:44:01.836 --> 01:44:04.679]  They're not offering another argument.
[01:44:04.979 --> 01:44:06.701]  They're countering our argument.
[01:44:06.741 --> 01:44:08.423]  So our argument must be strong.
[01:44:09.241 --> 01:44:15.765]  And there's also that tactic where they launch their attacks and announce their world government and say the UN's in charge and say they're going to get rid of the family.
[01:44:15.785 --> 01:44:17.586]  And then they go, hey, we don't want you to do that.
[01:44:17.606 --> 01:44:18.606]  And they go, we're not doing that.
[01:44:19.046 --> 01:44:21.708]  That's a game of never even respecting us to have a real debate.
[01:44:21.888 --> 01:44:27.431]  They just move forward and say, we're not assaulting you like Mars attacks when the Martians are ray gunning everybody.
[01:44:27.751 --> 01:44:31.033]  And they're running around with a speaker system saying, don't run, we are your friends.
[01:44:31.053 --> 01:44:32.194]  And you go, well why are they doing that?
[01:44:32.434 --> 01:44:33.135]  Well, they shoot you.
[01:44:33.415 --> 01:44:38.938]  That's a real military tactic from World War I to say, the tanks are your friends, lay down, your generals have given up.
[01:44:39.319 --> 01:44:43.802]  And even though people knew that wasn't true, some would give up because, well, they're saying the war's over.
[01:44:43.882 --> 01:44:44.082]  Right.
[01:44:44.162 --> 01:44:45.763]  Or they're saying that our generals gave up.
[01:44:46.083 --> 01:44:46.984]  It was just disinfo.
[01:44:47.384 --> 01:45:00.717]  It's disinformation, it's propaganda, and what people need to understand is that the other side, because again, this takes a while to understand, we're not, the Democrats are not our enemies, they are people who are our opponents that we need to convert.
[01:45:01.077 --> 01:45:05.461]  There are real enemies, and they serve Satan, but they are countering our argument.
[01:45:05.481 --> 01:45:07.863]  So what we need to understand is that they operate with secrets,
[01:45:08.444 --> 01:45:10.005]  And then they operate in plain sight.
[01:45:10.545 --> 01:45:12.386]  And what they seek to do is invert the world.
[01:45:12.546 --> 01:45:17.508]  And we talked about this a couple weeks ago, is what we must do is invert their inversion.
[01:45:17.748 --> 01:45:22.310]  What they want in plain sight, we must obliterate and wipe from the face of the earth.
[01:45:22.850 --> 01:45:23.270]  Exactly!
[01:45:23.311 --> 01:45:25.331]  They tell us we can't say man and woman.
[01:45:25.511 --> 01:45:26.692]  There aren't just two sexes.
[01:45:26.952 --> 01:45:28.113]  We should take down crosses.
[01:45:28.333 --> 01:45:29.773]  We shouldn't say the name Jesus Christ.
[01:45:30.053 --> 01:45:30.794]  That's not okay.
[01:45:30.834 --> 01:45:31.334]  This isn't okay.
[01:45:31.494 --> 01:45:33.415]  And they're replacing it all with their iconography.
[01:45:33.675 --> 01:45:33.855]  Right.
[01:45:33.955 --> 01:45:35.436]  And it's always the same.
[01:45:35.496 --> 01:45:38.759]  The progressives, the democrats, the communists, the socialists.
[01:45:39.039 --> 01:45:40.080]  It's always the same.
[01:45:40.380 --> 01:45:43.062]  Replace the mother and the father with the state.
[01:45:43.202 --> 01:45:43.482]  Why?
[01:45:43.682 --> 01:45:45.864]  Because then we can't honor our mother and father.
[01:45:46.144 --> 01:45:49.546]  And the Bible promises if we honor our mother and our father, we will live long days.
[01:45:49.666 --> 01:45:50.187]  Well, absolutely.
[01:45:50.207 --> 01:45:51.868]  Because then it passes on the epigenetics.
[01:45:51.948 --> 01:45:53.149]  It gets a tribe together.
[01:45:53.229 --> 01:45:54.690]  People that care about something real.
[01:45:54.930 --> 01:45:56.111]  People that don't have the families.
[01:45:56.191 --> 01:45:57.392]  We scientifically know this.
[01:45:57.452 --> 01:45:58.192]  We scientifically know.
[01:45:58.212 --> 01:45:58.592]  They fall apart.
[01:45:58.612 --> 01:45:59.493]  The people that don't have it fall apart.
[01:45:59.513 --> 01:46:00.954]  We're not saying you're bad if that happened to you.
[01:46:00.974 --> 01:46:02.155]  You just have to understand that
[01:46:02.515 --> 01:46:05.336]  The attack on the nuclear family is the attack on the species.
[01:46:05.636 --> 01:46:07.976]  Right, and it sounded so, I guess, cringey.
[01:46:08.336 --> 01:46:10.037]  I thought it was cringey when I first got into politics.
[01:46:10.057 --> 01:46:12.817]  Like, oh, you social conservatives, you're a bunch of wackos.
[01:46:12.857 --> 01:46:15.318]  Like, I love Jesus, but you guys are a bunch of wackos.
[01:46:15.338 --> 01:46:24.000]  But no, the war on the nuclear family, the war on language by the Marxists, the push for a one-world currency, but different languages.
[01:46:24.020 --> 01:46:27.741]  You know, we talked about the Tower of Babel, the fact that they don't want us to have a national anthem.
[01:46:28.021 --> 01:46:29.441]  They don't want us to have a flag.
[01:46:29.741 --> 01:46:31.622]  They don't want us to have the same Pledge of Allegiance.
[01:46:31.882 --> 01:46:33.182]  So we'll literally share nothing.
[01:46:33.522 --> 01:46:34.323]  We'll share nothing.
[01:46:34.503 --> 01:46:35.343]  We won't share language.
[01:46:35.363 --> 01:46:36.183]  We won't share skin color.
[01:46:36.203 --> 01:46:37.383]  We'll be atomized and alone.
[01:46:37.403 --> 01:46:47.266]  Remember what Sean Parker said, formerly editor of Facebook, he said, we designed it to make it addictive and destructive and to manipulate your weaknesses and to make you weaker and weaker and weaker and alone to totally control you.
[01:46:47.706 --> 01:46:49.106]  I mean, it's a face sucker, folks.
[01:46:49.186 --> 01:46:49.826]  It wants you.
[01:46:50.086 --> 01:46:50.286]  Right.
[01:46:50.346 --> 01:46:56.188]  And we must accept, right, and this is the beautiful part about religion and the beautiful part about God is
[01:46:57.188 --> 01:46:59.750]  It's summed up by, okay, well, this is why we're obedient.
[01:47:00.390 --> 01:47:04.113]  There are things that work outside of God, but they don't last.
[01:47:04.413 --> 01:47:09.557]  So, yes, you can find what feels like happiness in that dopamine hit.
[01:47:09.877 --> 01:47:17.222]  Yes, you can find riches inside of doing something horrible like Soros or the Clintons, but you won't find lasting peace.
[01:47:17.603 --> 01:47:21.045]  You won't find goodness, and you won't find heaven or the kingdom of God.
[01:47:21.065 --> 01:47:24.848]  Well, if you look at the Clintons and these servants of Satan, they are horribly unhappy.
[01:47:25.228 --> 01:47:25.629]  They are!
[01:47:26.249 --> 01:47:27.350]  And it shows in their face.
[01:47:27.671 --> 01:47:29.332]  I know people that know them behind the scenes.
[01:47:29.372 --> 01:47:35.939]  They say that unless they're doing evil, they feel like they're being tortured, nightmares, they're being attacked by demons.
[01:47:35.979 --> 01:47:39.242]  It's like Lady Gaga has someone sleep in the room with her that says demons are attacking her.
[01:47:39.683 --> 01:47:45.168]  And I talked to the former top psychiatrist, the lady that interviews all the people on death row, the serial killers.
[01:47:45.649 --> 01:47:46.790]  She said, no, it's really true.
[01:47:47.671 --> 01:47:49.111]  None of them are atheists like you here.
[01:47:49.532 --> 01:47:55.753]  They all do this because demons are telling them to, and they only feel alive when they're torturing and murdering and doing bad things.
[01:47:56.053 --> 01:48:00.775]  It's like a white light gets all around them, but then they have nightmares and are tortured when they're not doing bad.
[01:48:01.015 --> 01:48:03.495]  So they go out and do this because they're literally slaves.
[01:48:04.215 --> 01:48:06.196]  This, folks, is not an exaggeration.
[01:48:06.476 --> 01:48:11.998]  As somebody who knows a lot of these closet Christians and conservatives in Hollywood,
[01:48:13.942 --> 01:48:18.545]  They are tortured by it, and when we come back, we should talk about Lady Gaga, Marina Abramovic.
[01:48:18.825 --> 01:48:19.606]  That's her mentor.
[01:48:19.946 --> 01:48:23.368]  And that's the woman who's running a lot of these circles in Hollywood with Satanists.
[01:48:23.668 --> 01:48:25.229]  Let's talk about it when we come back.
[01:48:25.929 --> 01:48:27.190]  We're going to take your phone calls.
[01:48:28.131 --> 01:48:31.213]  Ladies and gentlemen, on the other side, it's Ali Alexander and Alex Jones.
[01:48:31.693 --> 01:48:33.914]  Remember, you can overpower the AI.
[01:48:33.974 --> 01:48:34.895]  You can take action.
[01:48:35.195 --> 01:48:41.139]  You can spread the links to Band.Video, InfoWars.com, and now another URL I'll tell you about when we come back.
[01:48:42.398 --> 01:48:49.323]  The Guter Dammerung in German lore, or archetypes, is the battle of the gods.
[01:48:51.144 --> 01:48:57.029]  Well, the globalists think they're gods, they're not, but they are definitely moving the Antichrist world system into an accelerated takeover mode.
[01:48:57.649 --> 01:49:01.312]  World government, digital tracking chips under the skin to buy and sell.
[01:49:02.603 --> 01:49:13.271]  All of it being announced, the attack on the family, all of the occultic stuff at football games, and the Olympics, and I know you know a lot of folks, you've been a political consultant for 13 years, I've seen all the big circles you've been in.
[01:49:13.691 --> 01:49:27.242]  You go a lot of places, you were saying, oh right there, when I brought up Lady Gaga and the demons, and evil being at the heart of this, and the Sobranovich lady, who said, oh I slander her, and I attack her, and she was gonna sue me, but she decided not to, because it'd take too long.
[01:49:28.652 --> 01:49:30.233]  I'm not even the one going after the lady.
[01:49:30.313 --> 01:49:36.537]  She's the one having all these events, going out and saying on Reddit forums that it is rituals to her.
[01:49:36.717 --> 01:49:36.878]  Yep.
[01:49:37.098 --> 01:49:39.599]  She's the one in the WikiLeaks with all this stuff.
[01:49:39.659 --> 01:49:40.800]  She's the one doing this.
[01:49:42.681 --> 01:49:44.723]  And then she sits there and says, oh, I'm not into the occult.
[01:49:45.003 --> 01:49:46.244]  Well, what's your research show?
[01:49:46.832 --> 01:49:52.034]  What people need to understand is that art is one of the oldest forms of money laundering.
[01:49:52.294 --> 01:49:57.116]  When nations fall, they move gold and they hide their funds inside of art.
[01:49:57.576 --> 01:50:00.877]  Marina Abramovic claims to be a performance artist.
[01:50:01.477 --> 01:50:04.559]  This is a woman who actually coaches some of the Hollywood elite.
[01:50:04.599 --> 01:50:10.641]  So when Lady Gaga's career was not taking off, she was handed over to Marina Abramovic.
[01:50:10.781 --> 01:50:16.003]  Marina Abramovic made Lady Gaga walk for days through the forest naked.
[01:50:16.463 --> 01:50:24.308]  Totally destroyed who she was and then rebuilt, recasted, essentially a satanic ego.
[01:50:24.628 --> 01:50:30.072]  And that's the Lady Gaga that we saw come on with with house music and all this other type of stuff.
[01:50:30.512 --> 01:50:34.335]  And when Lady Gaga then tried to do that opera music, that was her trying to find herself.
[01:50:34.375 --> 01:50:36.316]  But no, she's found her way back here.
[01:50:36.556 --> 01:50:38.057]  We've seen this with Jessica Simpson.
[01:50:38.338 --> 01:50:39.738]  We've seen this with Katy Perry.
[01:50:40.599 --> 01:50:42.220]  This happens a lot with these people.
[01:50:42.600 --> 01:50:44.462]  But what I will tell you, you know, one day I was
[01:50:45.302 --> 01:50:57.970]  I was in Hollywood, again can't say where, and this very famous artist was being presented with boards from a marketing company of images that they were pitching for a music video.
[01:50:58.751 --> 01:51:03.514]  And one of them involved spirit cooking, and I just thought,
[01:51:04.881 --> 01:51:05.822]  This is not normal.
[01:51:05.862 --> 01:51:07.243]  You shouldn't present this to this artist.
[01:51:07.263 --> 01:51:09.005]  This artist is not into that type of stuff.
[01:51:09.025 --> 01:51:11.728]  For folks that don't know, that's Aleister Crowley sex magic stuff.
[01:51:12.148 --> 01:51:13.550]  It's really creepy.
[01:51:13.570 --> 01:51:19.296]  It made my stomach curl and I decided there, I mean, I really had a conviction, a crisis of conviction.
[01:51:19.336 --> 01:51:19.976]  I was like, okay.
[01:51:20.797 --> 01:51:27.179]  I need to say something in this next meeting, and I would rather get kicked out and shown the door than not say something.
[01:51:27.219 --> 01:51:29.959]  This is satanic being presented, and that's what they do.
[01:51:30.219 --> 01:51:36.881]  They just take these artists, they frenzy them up, and then they subvert their art, or they just totally co-opt them like they did.
[01:51:37.041 --> 01:51:44.403]  That's what Hollywood is about, and that's why it's so empty, is sucking dreams, twisting people's destinies, and making you become fallen.
[01:51:45.224 --> 01:51:48.293]  And they're all just a bunch of arrogant crazies that think they're God.
[01:51:48.614 --> 01:51:50.499]  And again, I had Hollywood reach out to me.
[01:51:51.505 --> 01:51:52.906]  Not the bad element of it, you know.
[01:51:53.286 --> 01:51:54.346]  Rick Legletter's a good guy.
[01:51:54.746 --> 01:51:57.067]  But then, the big Hollywood took me out there.
[01:51:57.087 --> 01:51:58.548]  And not just Charlie Sheen, folks.
[01:51:58.568 --> 01:52:02.970]  I know people... There's a lot of people who watch you, Alex.
[01:52:03.010 --> 01:52:05.411]  But the point is, I got to really see stuff.
[01:52:05.911 --> 01:52:08.492]  And they point blank just went, hey, we really do follow Lucifer.
[01:52:08.512 --> 01:52:10.253]  And I'm like, what do you think, I'm a Christian?
[01:52:10.293 --> 01:52:10.773]  I am a Christian.
[01:52:10.793 --> 01:52:11.353]  That shocks me.
[01:52:11.393 --> 01:52:11.974]  He's trying to shock me.
[01:52:11.994 --> 01:52:12.574]  No, this is real.
[01:52:12.834 --> 01:52:13.014]  Yeah.
[01:52:13.154 --> 01:52:15.055]  So if you're not into that, you probably don't want to go to this party tonight.
[01:52:15.595 --> 01:52:16.596]  And then it happened again and again.
[01:52:16.616 --> 01:52:17.397]  It happened to Mark Dice.
[01:52:17.757 --> 01:52:21.440]  They were about to give him this big deal with a major Motley Crue guy.
[01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:23.922]  I guess we don't have to go that far, but I just did it.
[01:52:23.942 --> 01:52:24.642]  It was ten years later.
[01:52:25.223 --> 01:52:26.224]  And they get him in this room.
[01:52:26.244 --> 01:52:27.104]  It wasn't the Motley Crue guy.
[01:52:27.124 --> 01:52:28.666]  And he's just the head of the company.
[01:52:28.706 --> 01:52:30.647]  The head of a major reality TV show.
[01:52:30.687 --> 01:52:31.748]  The biggest company, okay?
[01:52:32.309 --> 01:52:33.249]  They tried to get me to do a show.
[01:52:33.329 --> 01:52:33.910]  I knew better.
[01:52:34.590 --> 01:52:35.771]  And they offered him the show.
[01:52:36.252 --> 01:52:37.653]  And they go, okay, we like the pilot.
[01:52:38.273 --> 01:52:41.096]  We want you to just go ahead and pledge yourself to Lucifer.
[01:52:42.079 --> 01:52:42.519]  Yeah.
[01:52:42.599 --> 01:52:45.180]  And Mark's like, uh, you trying to shock me again because I'm a Christian?
[01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:46.260]  I know this is real, buddy.
[01:52:46.780 --> 01:52:48.340]  So do you want this national show or not?
[01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:48.880]  Give me a big head.
[01:52:49.200 --> 01:52:49.721]  Mark said no.
[01:52:50.041 --> 01:52:59.363]  And what people need to do is when you read this literature, you know, you want to pray up, stay up, but when you read this literature, what you'll find out is that Luciferianism is sold to them as ego.
[01:52:59.403 --> 01:53:01.043]  Like, oh, this is self-empowerment.
[01:53:01.063 --> 01:53:02.103]  This is about you.
[01:53:02.323 --> 01:53:06.684]  You know, whereas Wiccan is about, is about pantheism and the worship of the nature.
[01:53:06.924 --> 01:53:07.124]  Exactly.
[01:53:07.504 --> 01:53:09.945]  The new movie that came out last year called Hell Satan.
[01:53:10.885 --> 01:53:11.966]  About the Satanic Church.
[01:53:12.167 --> 01:53:13.869]  Oh, it's the Democrats' new operating system.
[01:53:13.889 --> 01:53:15.010]  We don't really believe in God.
[01:53:15.811 --> 01:53:17.693]  But then by the end of it, we really are Satanists.
[01:53:17.713 --> 01:53:18.474]  We're hurting ourselves.
[01:53:18.914 --> 01:53:20.356]  No, they believe in it, folks.
[01:53:20.396 --> 01:53:20.737]  It's real.
[01:53:20.857 --> 01:53:22.078]  They really believe in it.
[01:53:22.178 --> 01:53:23.139]  And it's really shocking.
[01:53:23.159 --> 01:53:28.546]  That's why I said, during this pandemic, I took two and a half months off from all... Say that again because I interrupt you and I'm the king of that.
[01:53:28.946 --> 01:53:29.346]  Start over.
[01:53:29.947 --> 01:53:38.394]  So what people need to understand, how they sell it, so Luciferianism is sold as self-empowerment.
[01:53:38.514 --> 01:53:42.957]  It's sold as humanism, as we would call it in politics or sociology.
[01:53:43.378 --> 01:53:47.321]  Whereas Wiccan, if you study anybody who's a Wiccan, considers themselves a witch.
[01:53:47.961 --> 01:53:49.662]  They are essentially pantheists.
[01:53:49.682 --> 01:53:51.322]  They are people who worship nature.
[01:53:51.603 --> 01:53:53.023]  And that's what you see in the UN.
[01:53:53.083 --> 01:53:58.826]  That's what you see with the Greta Thunberg, you know, line of things and the Marina Abramovic line of things.
[01:53:59.266 --> 01:54:09.650]  And then when they sell, oh, the Bill Gates line of things and the scientism line of things, is they're pushing humanism and pantheism to see which the public is going to adopt because they're both rebellions of God.
[01:54:09.790 --> 01:54:12.793]  And then Gates is meeting with all of them with Jeffrey Epstein behind the scenes.
[01:54:13.033 --> 01:54:18.738]  And he is, because one is the worship of self, and the other is worship of God's creation.
[01:54:18.918 --> 01:54:20.420]  And both are forbidden in the Bible.
[01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:21.601]  Specifically.
[01:54:21.901 --> 01:54:23.442]  And so this isn't a coincidence, folks.
[01:54:23.723 --> 01:54:24.703]  This isn't, um...
[01:54:25.444 --> 01:54:28.887]  This isn't, oh, like, people just go around, like, devil, devil, devil, devil, devil.
[01:54:29.527 --> 01:54:33.491]  It's sold to them one way, they get into it, and then they're like, okay, well, it works.
[01:54:33.591 --> 01:54:35.392]  Because there is stuff that works.
[01:54:35.412 --> 01:54:38.055]  The Bible says that there will be magic and wonders.
[01:54:38.075 --> 01:54:39.696]  Well, it's the God of this world.
[01:54:40.136 --> 01:54:40.657]  Exactly.
[01:54:41.077 --> 01:54:42.218]  And that's what we need to understand.
[01:54:42.278 --> 01:54:43.339]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:54:43.379 --> 01:54:44.780]  You get into this, you get offered everything.
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:46.682]  And believe me, they know who to recruit, too.
[01:54:46.882 --> 01:54:47.102]  Yep.
[01:54:47.122 --> 01:54:48.143]  They tried to recruit my dad.
[01:54:48.583 --> 01:54:49.464]  They tried to recruit me.
[01:54:49.484 --> 01:54:51.326]  I mean, it's because they know.
[01:54:51.346 --> 01:54:52.767]  I mean, they know who's up and coming.
[01:54:52.987 --> 01:54:53.248]  They do.
[01:54:53.528 --> 01:54:53.829]  They do.
[01:54:54.049 --> 01:54:55.874]  And they want to co-opt as many people as they can.
[01:54:55.894 --> 01:54:58.560]  They want to go after hurt people or emerging people.
[01:55:00.959 --> 01:55:01.399]  Exactly.
[01:55:01.439 --> 01:55:03.481]  They want to go after hurt people and emerging people.
[01:55:03.981 --> 01:55:05.383]  So, Wendy, you're a smart guy.
[01:55:05.403 --> 01:55:06.103]  I mean, I'm really impressed.
[01:55:06.123 --> 01:55:08.985]  That's why I was telling them a month ago, get Ali Alexander on a lot.
[01:55:09.846 --> 01:55:11.828]  I mean, I'm really impressed because you really get it.
[01:55:12.128 --> 01:55:13.369]  And most people don't get it.
[01:55:13.429 --> 01:55:15.671]  And you know how to just fault it out.
[01:55:16.051 --> 01:55:16.271]  Right.
[01:55:16.291 --> 01:55:21.756]  Or they say it, you know, you know, with all due respect to everybody else's, is they say it in a way that sounds unbelievable.
[01:55:21.796 --> 01:55:26.319]  But what I really had to do, and that's why I'm wearing... This is a philosophy of control.
[01:55:26.399 --> 01:55:28.121]  It's a philosophy of power that's ancient.
[01:55:28.766 --> 01:55:30.287]  Very, very ancient.
[01:55:30.368 --> 01:55:38.134]  It's not, you know, one day we'll have to do a whole special Alex, maybe after the election, dissecting Jeffrey Epstein's temple and what it means.
[01:55:38.154 --> 01:55:41.077]  Like, has anybody wondered, like, what is this obsession, right?
[01:55:41.137 --> 01:55:42.598]  If Freemason- Let's do it tomorrow.
[01:55:42.658 --> 01:55:44.100]  Do we have an hour open at 1 again?
[01:55:49.380 --> 01:55:50.381]  We'll do an hour tomorrow.
[01:55:50.441 --> 01:55:56.224]  Yeah, but what people need to understand is like, what's the obsession with Freemasonry if it was born in Scotland?
[01:55:56.484 --> 01:55:57.924]  What's the obsession with Egypt?
[01:55:58.325 --> 01:55:59.665]  What's the obsession with Egypt?
[01:55:59.885 --> 01:56:01.906]  What was Shakespeare's obsession with Egypt?
[01:56:02.107 --> 01:56:04.368]  What was da Vinci's obsession with Egypt?
[01:56:04.568 --> 01:56:06.709]  What is Jay-Z's obsession with Egypt?
[01:56:06.849 --> 01:56:09.690]  What is Marina Abramovic's obsession with Egypt?
[01:56:10.091 --> 01:56:15.493]  And I'll tell you, Jeffrey Epstein knew, Jeffrey Epstein knew, and that will connect all of these things.
[01:56:15.613 --> 01:56:18.315]  And it just, it sounds fantastical, but again,
[01:56:18.835 --> 01:56:24.099]  I tell, this is what I tell people, Alex, whenever it gets too far down the conversation, look, you don't have to believe me.
[01:56:24.119 --> 01:56:25.560]  I mean, I know.
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:30.643]  I mean, they tell us they believe the Egyptians were in touch with aliens and advanced knowledge.
[01:56:30.924 --> 01:56:31.104]  Yeah.
[01:56:31.404 --> 01:56:33.285]  And then that's what happened with Solomon's Temple.
[01:56:33.546 --> 01:56:34.866]  That's where masonry really began.
[01:56:34.886 --> 01:56:35.287]  Right.
[01:56:35.387 --> 01:56:47.375]  And then when the Masons had to flee one of the nation states or city states in Italy, they ran to Scotland and then set it up there and move their operations from Italy over to the UK.
[01:56:47.415 --> 01:56:48.036]  What's the UK today?
[01:56:48.476 --> 01:56:54.160]  Right, and this is why their calendar is obscured, and this is why they obscured the church's calendar.
[01:56:55.341 --> 01:56:58.384]  You got the Julian calendar and the Gregorian calendar.
[01:56:58.644 --> 01:57:02.647]  And then over at the Masons, you have the London Lodge that says, oh, we incorporated in 1717.
[01:57:02.807 --> 01:57:06.230]  You have the Scottish that says, oh, we're 13-whatever.
[01:57:06.350 --> 01:57:10.093]  It's all confusion about the calendar, and that's why they rely on horoscopes.
[01:57:10.333 --> 01:57:14.796]  If we could have the crew bring up the Economist cover of 2017, which says the year of 2017,
[01:57:15.837 --> 01:57:17.078]  All of this stuff is predicted.
[01:57:17.118 --> 01:57:23.323]  This is the scariest thing that, you know, you'll ever see, but these tarot cards on the Economist cover of 2017... Sure.
[01:57:23.483 --> 01:57:25.245]  Marina Abramovic... Let me just throw this out again.
[01:57:25.525 --> 01:57:26.906]  Is the 1 o'clock hour open tomorrow?
[01:57:28.807 --> 01:57:29.328]  Fantastic.
[01:57:29.348 --> 01:57:29.628]  Thank you.
[01:57:29.988 --> 01:57:31.149]  We'll do it tomorrow at 1.
[01:57:31.750 --> 01:57:32.110]  Okay.
[01:57:32.690 --> 01:57:33.491]  But we're going to come back.
[01:57:33.531 --> 01:57:33.911]  There it is.
[01:57:34.011 --> 01:57:34.712]  World in 2017.
[01:57:35.272 --> 01:57:38.295]  And Marina Abramovic predicted all eight of these things.
[01:57:40.606 --> 01:57:41.287]  But it's not hard.
[01:57:41.387 --> 01:57:42.067]  It's all a plan.
[01:57:42.087 --> 01:57:43.128]  She's just reading off a road map.
[01:57:43.489 --> 01:57:43.709]  Right.
[01:57:43.929 --> 01:57:44.810]  This is their site.
[01:57:44.850 --> 01:57:52.677]  I promise we're going to Joe, Jeff, Michael, Ural, Simi, Chris, Patrick, and Cory before we end this because Paul Watson is taking over.
[01:57:53.098 --> 01:57:53.878]  So get ready.
[01:57:53.959 --> 01:57:54.939]  Ali Alexander is our guest.
[01:57:55.340 --> 01:58:00.244]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and now CensoredByJack.com.
[01:58:00.945 --> 01:58:03.728]  Well, Ali Alexander is a smart guy.
[01:58:03.748 --> 01:58:06.510]  I look forward to having him on The War Room to actually handicap the election.
[01:58:07.010 --> 01:58:10.233]  Look at the electoral map and why the Democrats are so upset.
[01:58:10.313 --> 01:58:15.338]  That is going to be coming up in the third hour of The War Room today, five o'clock central.
[01:58:15.838 --> 01:58:19.481]  Please don't forget that they are now blocking all of our links at Twitter.
[01:58:19.501 --> 01:58:26.427]  That means it'll be everywhere else soon for Bandot Video, where the live feeds are and where all the archives are, and it's just amazing information.
[01:58:27.469 --> 01:58:34.113]  So we've launched a new URL that has all the same links, all the same videos, but with different URLs that aren't blocked by Twitter.
[01:58:34.453 --> 01:58:36.314]  And if they block it, we've got a new URL.
[01:58:36.614 --> 01:58:38.175]  This is how we get around the censorship.
[01:58:38.195 --> 01:58:39.035]  It's how we fight back.
[01:58:39.656 --> 01:58:41.837]  CensoredByJack.com.
[01:58:41.937 --> 01:58:42.737]  Everybody share that.
[01:58:43.838 --> 01:58:45.919]  CensoredByJack.com.
[01:58:46.319 --> 01:58:47.740]  CensoredByJack.com.
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:49.181]  Okay, we're gonna go to your calls.
[01:58:50.359 --> 01:58:52.820]  Joe in Wisconsin, going for total U.N.
[01:58:52.860 --> 01:58:53.340]  control.
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:54.541]  Absolutely.
[01:58:54.561 --> 01:58:57.141]  Give us your take on, we wake up and the U.N.'
[01:58:57.101 --> 01:58:57.482]  's here.
[01:58:57.742 --> 01:58:58.182]  The U.N.
[01:58:58.202 --> 01:59:02.443]  tells us about our police, our military, our government, the COVID response.
[01:59:02.863 --> 01:59:04.584]  We can only say online what the U.N.
[01:59:04.624 --> 01:59:05.424]  says we're allowed to.
[01:59:05.464 --> 01:59:06.025]  Isn't that nice?
[01:59:06.645 --> 01:59:06.925]  Joe.
[01:59:07.205 --> 01:59:07.625]  Hey, Alex.
[01:59:08.085 --> 01:59:10.186]  I have three things that we can all agree on.
[01:59:10.486 --> 01:59:12.567]  Governor Evers is doing nothing.
[01:59:13.143 --> 01:59:17.404]  Well, sir, I got all the documents three years ago where Alexander Soros is in command now.
[01:59:17.804 --> 01:59:19.004]  And they tell them how to do it.
[01:59:19.044 --> 01:59:23.805]  It's all... I mean, if I had a plan like this, the FBI would have arrested me years ago.
[01:59:23.925 --> 01:59:25.085]  I don't want to do this.
[01:59:25.125 --> 01:59:29.726]  But, I mean, they're just allowed to because they're part of the internal power structure.
[01:59:44.008 --> 01:59:49.231]  Well, have you asked why the Democrats don't want any federal troops from Trump?
[01:59:49.571 --> 01:59:57.235]  The big entourage is, since the cops are racist and unable to quell the unrest, send in the United Nations peacekeepers.
[01:59:57.616 --> 02:00:01.138]  They have zero loyalty to our government and our country.
[02:00:01.158 --> 02:00:02.338]  And what happens next?
[02:00:02.759 --> 02:00:06.080]  You have reports about foreign national troops on our bases?
[02:00:06.481 --> 02:00:07.141]  Why is that?
[02:00:07.481 --> 02:00:08.762]  I'll let you finish that story.
[02:00:10.814 --> 02:00:12.896]  You know, I said this again six months ago.
[02:00:12.916 --> 02:00:15.638]  Remember the Henry Kissinger quote from Evian France Bilderberg Group?
[02:00:15.879 --> 02:00:17.060]  He confirmed was his speech.
[02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:21.424]  He said, today the Americans would rebel if we brought the UN troops to LA.
[02:00:21.484 --> 02:00:23.245]  That was right after the LA riots.
[02:00:23.826 --> 02:00:26.288]  He said, but they will exert as the plan.
[02:00:26.809 --> 02:00:31.493]  Today Americans would be outraged if UN troops entered Los Angeles to restore order.
[02:00:31.974 --> 02:00:33.235]  Tomorrow they will be grateful.
[02:00:33.755 --> 02:00:41.119]  This is especially true if they were told there was an outside threat from beyond, whether real or promulgated, that threatened our very existence.
[02:00:41.619 --> 02:00:48.202]  It is then that all peoples of the world will pledge with world leaders and plead to deliver them from this evil.
[02:00:48.722 --> 02:00:50.723]  The one thing every man fears is the unknown.
[02:00:51.223 --> 02:00:58.787]  When presented with this scenario, individual rights will be willingly relinquished for the guarantee of their well-being granted to them by world government.
[02:00:59.327 --> 02:01:01.168]  Henry Kissinger, Bilderberg Group, May 21st, 1991, Evian, France.
[02:01:03.277 --> 02:01:09.080]  So the reason I bring that up is COVID-19, race riots, all of it, this is all orchestrated.
[02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:09.840]  Great points.
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:10.460]  Anything else, Joe?
[02:01:11.541 --> 02:01:27.208]  Yeah, I'm going to be calling my Senator Ron Johnson and I'm going to be asking him specifically if he can sneak in legislation against insurrection specifically that we are not going to capitulate and have UN troops come in and have like a dead man switch in there.
[02:01:28.168 --> 02:01:31.109]  It should be in the Defense Authorization Act, because you're right.
[02:01:31.709 --> 02:01:36.551]  Strong Cities, Loretta Lynch, when they were there four years ago, five years ago, in the U.N.
[02:01:36.631 --> 02:01:41.293]  saying, we're going to do this, they were having organ, they were like in ecstasy talking about the U.N.
[02:01:41.373 --> 02:01:42.573]  taking control of the police departments.
[02:01:42.833 --> 02:01:43.153]  I mean, it's 7277.
[02:01:43.253 --> 02:01:44.474]  I mean, it's memorandum 7277.
[02:01:44.794 --> 02:01:45.274]  God bless you, sir.
[02:01:48.462 --> 02:01:50.823]  Yeah, I just think that we're really at a precipice.
[02:01:50.863 --> 02:01:52.164]  I can't overstate it.
[02:01:52.204 --> 02:02:05.631]  There's never been a civilization in which people with a fiduciary duty and an independent duty, these are our district attorneys or our prosecutors, were funded in a partisan way like George Soros is doing with these district attorneys.
[02:02:05.971 --> 02:02:10.613]  We are going to have no-go zones in the United States, and it's not going to be because of religion.
[02:02:10.893 --> 02:02:14.035]  It's going to be because of partisan violence.
[02:02:14.315 --> 02:02:25.041]  That's right, and Hungary and Romania and Poland and Russia are defending themselves when they ban Soros groups that ultimately are, on record, trying to overthrow their country and take their people's freedoms.
[02:02:25.741 --> 02:02:25.981]  Yeah.
[02:02:26.002 --> 02:02:27.342]  George Soros is a terrorist.
[02:02:27.442 --> 02:02:29.704]  Even Town Hall is now calling for his arrest.
[02:02:30.024 --> 02:02:31.304]  I mean, he is a terrorist!
[02:02:31.745 --> 02:02:33.726]  He's... This rat-like son right there!
[02:02:34.506 --> 02:02:36.027]  They're really... Look how evil the son is!
[02:02:36.107 --> 02:02:37.468]  My good... Look at that little rat!
[02:02:39.292 --> 02:02:39.713]  They're pretty bad.
[02:02:39.733 --> 02:02:41.275]  And look at the hate in these people's eyes, man.
[02:02:41.295 --> 02:02:42.177]  They're so entitled.
[02:02:42.437 --> 02:02:42.657]  Yeah.
[02:02:42.678 --> 02:02:43.659]  Well, guess what, Satan?
[02:02:43.699 --> 02:02:44.180]  You lose!
[02:02:45.499 --> 02:02:51.564]  He gave another interview in the mid-80s where he said, I believe I'm the Messiah, but they tell me not to say that or they might lock me up.
[02:02:51.804 --> 02:02:52.044]  Did he?
[02:02:52.064 --> 02:02:53.265]  The Messiah, yeah.
[02:02:53.885 --> 02:02:55.146]  Soros believes he's the Messiah.
[02:02:55.206 --> 02:02:55.947]  Wow, I didn't know that.
[02:02:56.147 --> 02:02:58.168]  Well, look, this is what I tell people in the middle.
[02:02:58.609 --> 02:03:01.871]  Why aren't they giving out stocks and bonds and lands to black people?
[02:03:01.891 --> 02:03:04.053]  What about black equity to get people to buy in?
[02:03:04.073 --> 02:03:04.793]  No, I agree.
[02:03:05.233 --> 02:03:09.757]  I'm all for incentives, like how about no taxes if you develop a business for a while.
[02:03:10.577 --> 02:03:12.779]  That's the real reparation for everybody.
[02:03:12.919 --> 02:03:13.640]  I want that too.
[02:03:13.920 --> 02:03:19.625]  But why doesn't Soros give his money to encourage minorities and other people?
[02:03:19.645 --> 02:03:19.885]  Oh, no, no.
[02:03:19.905 --> 02:03:22.267]  He wants them under control to literally sterilize them.
[02:03:22.287 --> 02:03:22.468]  Right.
[02:03:22.588 --> 02:03:28.633]  He gets young, rowdy people to commit violence in the streets, and he's been doing it for decades, and that's all he's doing.
[02:03:28.673 --> 02:03:29.854]  So he doesn't care about black people.
[02:03:29.874 --> 02:03:31.015]  He doesn't care about gay people.
[02:03:31.055 --> 02:03:32.056]  Well, yeah, he wants to kill them.
[02:03:32.336 --> 02:03:41.803]  Let me tell you, I notice the satanic rituals, the obsessions with the elites, it's not just that it's easier for them to get black kids, they really like killing black kids.
[02:03:42.063 --> 02:03:42.443]  Eugenics.
[02:03:42.763 --> 02:03:42.943]  Yeah.
[02:03:43.123 --> 02:03:53.871]  You know, it's eugenics and I think that they want to, you know, when your quality of life and you need to depopulate the world and you prioritize it, you know, black people aren't high up on that list.
[02:03:56.272 --> 02:03:56.833]  I just think
[02:03:58.621 --> 02:04:00.742]  Because a lot of it's third world, they're able to cover it up easier.
[02:04:01.022 --> 02:04:01.903]  Oh yeah, totally.
[02:04:02.023 --> 02:04:07.046]  And I think because blacks have been on the menu so long, that I guess it's just kind of like what's served in the satanic restaurants.
[02:04:07.486 --> 02:04:10.167]  I'm not trying to be gross here folks, I'm dead serious.
[02:04:10.528 --> 02:04:18.332]  When you study like Haiti and the Clintons and all this, I mean, and when they have choices, when you read and they get caught, they like want black kids on the menu.
[02:04:18.692 --> 02:04:20.673]  It's uncanny, but it's also the U.S.
[02:04:20.713 --> 02:04:21.053]  government.
[02:04:21.073 --> 02:04:21.593]  You know, in St.
[02:04:21.653 --> 02:04:28.516]  Louis, there was a project where they were spraying chemical poison on the black population in the black part of town in St.
[02:04:28.556 --> 02:04:28.856]  Louis.
[02:04:29.117 --> 02:04:32.298]  They were chemically castrating black prisoners in North Carolina.
[02:04:32.338 --> 02:04:32.918]  Tuskegee.
[02:04:32.958 --> 02:04:33.479]  Tuskegee.
[02:04:33.679 --> 02:04:36.820]  Yeah, so this is something that central planners do.
[02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:38.241]  That's what I call them, central planners.
[02:04:38.661 --> 02:04:40.382]  But, you know... I know what it is.
[02:04:40.662 --> 02:04:43.123]  They use systemic real racism that was there before.
[02:04:43.863 --> 02:04:46.886]  In certain groups to go, oh, don't worry, it's only the blacks we're doing it to.
[02:04:46.906 --> 02:04:47.066]  Right.
[02:04:47.246 --> 02:04:50.009]  They just did it to the blacks, not because they want to, because they want to get everybody.
[02:04:50.209 --> 02:04:51.731]  It was because that was the group they could get away with.
[02:04:52.591 --> 02:04:52.752]  Bingo.
[02:04:52.772 --> 02:04:54.313]  Couldn't have said it better.
[02:04:54.874 --> 02:04:55.915]  People make me sick, man.
[02:04:55.955 --> 02:04:56.095]  Yeah.
[02:04:56.495 --> 02:04:56.715]  Yeah.
[02:04:57.236 --> 02:04:59.017]  Well, and again, they want everybody.
[02:04:59.498 --> 02:04:59.678]  Yeah.
[02:04:59.798 --> 02:05:01.600]  That's the trick, is they want everybody.
[02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:02.501]  It's sick and it's evil.
[02:05:02.941 --> 02:05:04.843]  Chris in Missouri, you're on the air with Ale Alexander.
[02:05:04.883 --> 02:05:05.183]  Go ahead.
[02:05:06.204 --> 02:05:07.145]  Hey, Alex.
[02:05:07.405 --> 02:05:08.206]  Ale, can you guys hear me?
[02:05:08.346 --> 02:05:08.627]  Yes, sir.
[02:05:08.647 --> 02:05:08.887]  Go ahead.
[02:05:09.653 --> 02:05:11.454]  Alright, so what I want to talk about is a couple things.
[02:05:11.474 --> 02:05:12.796]  One, you guys are spot on.
[02:05:12.816 --> 02:05:17.239]  You're talking about, like, I think we just need to address the mark of the beast as the, like, most precedent thing.
[02:05:17.259 --> 02:05:21.102]  So I think what Trump has to do, because I think what he's trying to do, he's trying to win the election.
[02:05:21.462 --> 02:05:23.024]  He's kind of playing it, like, soft, though.
[02:05:23.044 --> 02:05:25.185]  He's trying to, like, appease everybody instead of going all in.
[02:05:25.486 --> 02:05:29.569]  And I think by going all in, there'll be some risk, but I think he'll actually win in more of a landslide.
[02:05:29.589 --> 02:05:30.249]  Well, here's the deal.
[02:05:30.289 --> 02:05:36.875]  If he's faced by them trying to have secession and not concede the election as a policy,
[02:05:38.092 --> 02:05:40.474]  Then he has to get radical because they're radical.
[02:05:40.654 --> 02:05:45.297]  In fact, I'll go back to you, Chris, but that's a question I asked earlier that you never had a chance to answer.
[02:05:45.497 --> 02:05:45.677]  Yeah.
[02:05:46.257 --> 02:05:49.940]  From your political angles and views, they are now officially saying they're going to contest.
[02:05:49.960 --> 02:05:50.680]  They know they're going to lose.
[02:05:50.780 --> 02:05:51.461]  They looked at the map.
[02:05:52.221 --> 02:05:53.402]  What does Trump do to counter that?
[02:05:53.422 --> 02:05:54.323]  I guess he just calls them out?
[02:05:55.143 --> 02:05:55.663]  We're screwed.
[02:05:56.083 --> 02:05:58.344]  And when I say we, I don't mean the Republicans or Conservatives.
[02:05:58.384 --> 02:06:03.406]  I mean we as an American people who are bound by a social contract called the United States Constitution.
[02:06:03.986 --> 02:06:05.586]  They went after the flag.
[02:06:06.026 --> 02:06:07.367]  They went after the anthem.
[02:06:08.167 --> 02:06:08.987]  They went after the plaque.
[02:06:09.007 --> 02:06:10.408]  Now they're marching saying F Jesus.
[02:06:10.748 --> 02:06:13.068]  Yeah, and they've closed the churches.
[02:06:15.089 --> 02:06:25.779]  November is going to be really scary I think for a lot of us who have studied history because they're just not you know Hillary Clinton said do not concede no matter what and that's her big regret.
[02:06:25.799 --> 02:06:27.741]  And I've got 10 times the anxiety I've ever had.
[02:06:27.761 --> 02:06:28.802]  My anxiety is always dead on.
[02:06:28.842 --> 02:06:30.103]  I mean it's beyond now.
[02:06:30.123 --> 02:06:30.684]  We're here.
[02:06:30.704 --> 02:06:31.645]  We're here.
[02:06:31.905 --> 02:06:33.767]  And I remember 2008
[02:06:35.248 --> 02:06:43.659]  When Barack Obama swept the map, remember we had a Republican Senator, Norm Coleman, and he was running against Al Franken.
[02:06:44.240 --> 02:06:50.509]  And Norm Coleman accidentally conceded, and that was the first time we were like, why are you conceding?
[02:06:50.829 --> 02:06:52.271]  They're finding random ballots.
[02:06:53.172 --> 02:06:56.554]  Al Franken only won because they found ballots in the trunk of a car.
[02:06:56.794 --> 02:06:58.135]  They stole that Senate seat.
[02:06:58.195 --> 02:07:04.619]  And remember, then they put Ted Stevens in Alaska under investigation so that he would, he lost his seat.
[02:07:04.659 --> 02:07:08.321]  And so, you know, this is, this has been a coup since 2008.
[02:07:08.741 --> 02:07:09.341]  It's been going on.
[02:07:09.461 --> 02:07:10.042]  Absolutely.
[02:07:10.082 --> 02:07:11.863]  They've been taking over the country since then.
[02:07:12.143 --> 02:07:12.303]  Yep.
[02:07:12.503 --> 02:07:14.344]  With the, with the prosecutors and everybody.
[02:07:14.424 --> 02:07:18.867]  And now America kind of woke up while the, while the gremlins are eating us.
[02:07:19.147 --> 02:07:24.269]  Yeah, and it's so, so, you know, like I said, this is going to be going through several federal courts.
[02:07:24.649 --> 02:07:32.732]  They prototyped it with Stacey Abrams in Georgia in 2018 when a federal judge says you can keep voting past election day.
[02:07:32.892 --> 02:07:35.694]  So imagine where half the country could just keep voting.
[02:07:35.714 --> 02:07:40.715]  So the strategy is throw it into doubt, flood the 80 million ballots to cattywampus it, and gum it up.
[02:07:40.996 --> 02:07:41.736]  Closing comment, Chris.
[02:07:43.095 --> 02:07:49.346]  Even before the election, because Trump doesn't have a guarantee that he's going to get re-elected, I think he'll be able to get a lot of things done, like fix Texans' ship once he does get elected.
[02:07:49.707 --> 02:07:56.018]  I think before that, he's got to open up the economy if it takes the National Guard going in to make sure that everybody can practice free market.
[02:07:56.500 --> 02:08:02.643]  Before then, I think we also got to be smart about the vaccine because I don't necessarily think the first one is going to be the mark of the beast, the 666 one.
[02:08:02.983 --> 02:08:03.563]  Oh, no, I agree.
[02:08:03.583 --> 02:08:06.105]  They're going to get us to set the precedent to take the vaccine.
[02:08:06.125 --> 02:08:06.845]  A legal precedent.
[02:08:07.185 --> 02:08:07.825]  A legal precedent.
[02:08:07.845 --> 02:08:08.646]  Then the big stuff comes.
[02:08:08.686 --> 02:08:08.886]  Yeah.
[02:08:09.386 --> 02:08:10.106]  Damn good call.
[02:08:10.147 --> 02:08:10.847]  Thank you so much, Chris.
[02:08:10.867 --> 02:08:11.907]  A few more calls straight ahead.
[02:08:12.328 --> 02:08:13.988]  And then Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[02:08:14.308 --> 02:08:14.989]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:08:15.069 --> 02:08:19.431]  Alan Alexander is going to be co-hosting with Owen Schroer in the War Room, 3 p.m.
[02:08:19.471 --> 02:08:20.391]  Central, 4 p.m.
[02:08:20.451 --> 02:08:21.472]  Eastern, 2 p.m.
[02:08:21.512 --> 02:08:23.013]  Mountain, 1 p.m.
[02:08:23.073 --> 02:08:23.533]  Pacific.
[02:08:24.824 --> 02:08:28.035]  We've got 68 days left, still time to defeat the Globalists.
[02:08:28.878 --> 02:08:30.102]  You know, I'm looking at Rand Paul.
[02:08:31.476 --> 02:08:33.037]  We'll tell you what he had to say coming up next segment.
[02:08:33.557 --> 02:08:34.898]  We're gonna have the video clip hopefully.
[02:08:35.398 --> 02:08:36.379]  I'm just not telling the crew to get it.
[02:08:37.119 --> 02:08:41.302]  Trump's first president of a generation to seek the end of war rather than start one.
[02:08:42.203 --> 02:08:43.944]  Christ said judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:08:44.484 --> 02:08:45.325]  Trump's the real deal.
[02:08:45.345 --> 02:08:48.246]  Look at how he's rallied the forces of evil against him.
[02:08:48.767 --> 02:08:49.967]  That tells you a lot right there.
[02:08:50.668 --> 02:08:51.989]  Let's take a few more calls here.
[02:08:52.489 --> 02:08:54.450]  Let's go ahead and who is up next?
[02:08:54.470 --> 02:08:55.251]  Who's been home the longest?
[02:08:55.291 --> 02:08:58.012]  I guess that would be Simi in Washington.
[02:08:58.052 --> 02:08:58.793]  Welcome and thank you.
[02:09:00.984 --> 02:09:01.584]  Hi, Alex.
[02:09:03.005 --> 02:09:03.205]  Welcome.
[02:09:03.265 --> 02:09:03.585]  Go ahead.
[02:09:04.726 --> 02:09:07.567]  OK, I just want to talk about what's going on in Portland.
[02:09:07.727 --> 02:09:14.090]  I'm from Portland and Portland isn't a political place, but somehow it's being one right now.
[02:09:14.210 --> 02:09:15.991]  So we need to make it stop.
[02:09:16.371 --> 02:09:21.133]  On Saturday, Savannah and Greg came down and they saw some pushback finally.
[02:09:21.153 --> 02:09:23.034]  And I'm really proud of that.
[02:09:23.054 --> 02:09:27.737]  But, you know, pepper spray and it feels they're not going to stop it.
[02:09:27.777 --> 02:09:28.497]  We need a hero.
[02:09:28.939 --> 02:09:31.180]  You're always asking, why aren't people standing up?
[02:09:31.220 --> 02:09:38.445]  They're not standing up because these hypocrites are pointing fingers in our face and think that we're racist if we're proud to be American.
[02:09:39.589 --> 02:09:42.171]  Yeah, that's why Soros did this.
[02:09:42.251 --> 02:09:46.773]  They're gonna try to overthrow America, bankrupt us, kill the dollar, something he's always wanted in the country.
[02:09:46.793 --> 02:09:55.819]  I mean, literally, destroy all your savings, any future, and they just have a group run by three Marxist black women they call Black Lives Matter that covers it.
[02:09:55.839 --> 02:09:58.500]  So you have to call their bluff and not worry about being called racist.
[02:09:58.881 --> 02:10:01.142]  Just say, shut up, you Nazi collaborator, and burn in hell.
[02:10:02.298 --> 02:10:02.879]  Hypocrites.
[02:10:03.299 --> 02:10:04.200]  They are the racists.
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:05.721]  They are the crazy people.
[02:10:06.041 --> 02:10:12.327]  They're the ones that shut down the economy for a 0.03 survival rate.
[02:10:12.527 --> 02:10:14.449]  You are crazy, not me.
[02:10:14.789 --> 02:10:19.794]  Like, if we want to save the country, we need men and women to stand up and fight.
[02:10:20.194 --> 02:10:24.458]  I know that one thing you always say is, don't go after the pawns, go after the head honcho.
[02:10:24.939 --> 02:10:26.220]  I'm trying to figure that out.
[02:10:26.340 --> 02:10:27.161]  How can I beat
[02:10:27.762 --> 02:10:29.123]  Bill Gates and Hillary Clinton.
[02:10:29.143 --> 02:10:29.823]  Well, I want to be clear.
[02:10:29.883 --> 02:10:34.426]  You should confront low-level minions with love and educate them, and if they're trying to bully you, you should stand up to them.
[02:10:34.906 --> 02:10:52.596]  I'm saying they want to kick off a civil war where we all go kill each other in the streets, and I'm just saying that to Trump and to people, you really have a job and a dereliction of duty if you don't to stop the kingpins, and now even mainline Republicans, National Review, Town Hall are saying arrest Soros.
[02:10:53.536 --> 02:10:54.637]  I'm not calling for violence.
[02:10:54.657 --> 02:11:00.602]  I'm saying if someone is pressing the button to launch attacks to their minions, you don't fight the minions.
[02:11:01.742 --> 02:11:02.983]  I mean, take nuclear war.
[02:11:03.023 --> 02:11:04.424]  You don't try to shoot down each missile.
[02:11:04.665 --> 02:11:06.346]  You try to blow up their missile fields first.
[02:11:07.407 --> 02:11:08.668]  You don't try to take out all the jets.
[02:11:08.848 --> 02:11:09.909]  You get the aircraft carrier.
[02:11:10.469 --> 02:11:12.591]  And so all I'm saying is I'm not planning anything.
[02:11:12.951 --> 02:11:21.998]  I'm saying they're attacking us, and we need to normalize the discussion of the fact to people whose job this is, if there's loyal folks left in our government, to stop it.
[02:11:22.538 --> 02:11:23.359]  I appreciate your call.
[02:11:23.399 --> 02:11:23.899]  Great question.
[02:11:23.919 --> 02:11:24.700]  You want to comment on that?
[02:11:25.140 --> 02:11:27.622]  Yeah, we have to disrupt their funding mechanisms.
[02:11:27.662 --> 02:11:32.866]  We have to contact our state attorney generals and say, investigate these motherfuckers.
[02:11:33.466 --> 02:11:36.929]  And probably shouldn't have said that, but, you know, that's what we ought to do.
[02:11:36.969 --> 02:11:40.131]  That's what they're doing in New York to Trump, and that's what we ought to do everywhere.
[02:11:40.272 --> 02:11:44.495]  Arkansas, Louisiana, and Alabama ought to be investigating these people.
[02:11:44.515 --> 02:11:45.115]  I agree.
[02:11:45.155 --> 02:11:46.977]  We have to stop being scared of
[02:11:47.637 --> 02:11:49.398]  The media, no one believes them.
[02:11:49.418 --> 02:11:50.439]  We need to go on the attack.
[02:11:50.679 --> 02:11:52.160]  Because listen, we didn't start this fight.
[02:11:52.240 --> 02:11:52.420]  No.
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:53.661]  So we better start fighting.
[02:11:53.881 --> 02:11:55.383]  And we've never fought like they have.
[02:11:55.403 --> 02:11:58.685]  And we're going to have a huge bloody war if we don't start using legal systems to crush them.
[02:11:58.825 --> 02:11:59.045]  Right.
[02:11:59.145 --> 02:12:00.846]  This is advocating for peace.
[02:12:00.866 --> 02:12:06.771]  We need to call out George Soros as Secretary of State project, his Attorney General project, and now this District Attorney project.
[02:12:06.791 --> 02:12:09.813]  Because they're taking control of the law enforcement to crush us.
[02:12:10.013 --> 02:12:11.554]  Yeah, they're inverting law.
[02:12:11.814 --> 02:12:13.655]  Because where are the protests happening, Alex?
[02:12:13.735 --> 02:12:17.138]  Except for the places where they immediately let people out on their own reconnaissance.
[02:12:17.458 --> 02:12:17.738]  That's it.
[02:12:18.219 --> 02:12:21.301]  So that's why it's in Portland is you protest, you get out.
[02:12:21.461 --> 02:12:22.442]  You protest, you get out.
[02:12:22.462 --> 02:12:24.163]  Because they've been given immunity by Satan.
[02:12:24.463 --> 02:12:25.744]  Right, and the police will resign.
[02:12:25.764 --> 02:12:28.886]  They'll demoralize the police so defunding the police won't be met.
[02:12:28.906 --> 02:12:31.188]  And then like dominoes, it'll fall to all the other cities.
[02:12:31.508 --> 02:12:31.908]  All of it.
[02:12:32.068 --> 02:12:32.409]  All of it.
[02:12:34.590 --> 02:12:40.735]  They'll control the infrastructure, the philosophical and metaphysical infrastructure of our country, our cities.
[02:12:41.035 --> 02:12:44.017]  I love that old fat guy tackling to Antifa, that footage right before then.
[02:12:44.457 --> 02:12:45.098]  It's just beautiful.
[02:12:46.369 --> 02:12:51.051]  But that guy with the spray, I mean, you got to be ahead, front lines if you're going to spray people.
[02:12:53.433 --> 02:12:54.073]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:12:54.093 --> 02:12:56.074]  I mean, look at this.
[02:12:56.094 --> 02:12:57.034]  This is just insane.
[02:12:57.094 --> 02:12:57.455]  All right.
[02:12:58.275 --> 02:12:58.855]  All right, folks.
[02:12:58.875 --> 02:13:02.197]  Paul Joseph Watts is taking over here, and I got one more piece I want to get to.
[02:13:05.979 --> 02:13:08.160]  There's a website you definitely don't want to visit or share.
[02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:09.921]  It bounces everybody to ban that video.
[02:13:09.981 --> 02:13:11.782]  It's censoredbyjack.com.
[02:13:12.287 --> 02:13:14.128]  Well I do, so we're in good stead.
[02:13:14.168 --> 02:13:16.368]  I'm Alex Jones, your host, InfoWars.com.
[02:13:16.948 --> 02:13:23.270]  Paul Joseph Watson from Summit.News is about to take over, but I had to air this today, just briefly get Ali Alexander's take on it.
[02:13:23.950 --> 02:13:35.574]  Stephen Colbert came out and does an in-game, not our in-game, the original in-game, but the Marvel Comics in-game, where Trump is disappearing the post office boxes and killing everybody, and Colbert says that
[02:13:36.354 --> 02:13:38.335]  That the Republicans are the party of death.
[02:13:38.415 --> 02:13:39.775]  Now the Democrats want abortion.
[02:13:40.056 --> 02:13:40.876]  They want infanticide.
[02:13:40.916 --> 02:13:42.056]  They want to kill the old people.
[02:13:42.396 --> 02:13:43.477]  Bill Gates is a Democrat.
[02:13:43.537 --> 02:13:44.297]  He wants all that.
[02:13:44.777 --> 02:13:48.159]  So talk about perfect, absolute inversion.
[02:13:48.399 --> 02:13:51.960]  Stephen Colbert calls Kimberly Guilfoyle a vengeful banshee.
[02:13:52.300 --> 02:13:53.401]  Suggests Don Jr.
[02:13:53.421 --> 02:13:54.161]  was on cocaine.
[02:13:54.221 --> 02:13:58.003]  Now that's Hunter, Hunter Biden during RNC speech.
[02:13:58.043 --> 02:14:00.324]  But that was our headline, but the real meat of it
[02:14:01.104 --> 02:14:12.850]  Was this guy, uh, the John Podesta, Tony Podesta's best friend, who parties with him, it's this jack-o'-lantern face telling us that we're the party of death when they're the party of abortion and all the rest of it.
[02:14:13.031 --> 02:14:14.171]  So here's the first few minutes of it.
[02:14:14.191 --> 02:14:20.174]  I believe the four nights are famine, pestilence, war, and death.
[02:14:21.715 --> 02:14:28.799]  Okay, I'm being told the actual themes are land of promise, land of opportunity, land of heroes, and land of greatness.
[02:14:28.819 --> 02:14:29.379]  Hit pause.
[02:14:29.439 --> 02:14:30.080]  I gotta just say this.
[02:14:31.118 --> 02:14:31.718]  In fact, back it up.
[02:14:31.738 --> 02:14:32.498]  We'll start at the beginning.
[02:14:32.638 --> 02:14:33.799]  That way we get the first few seconds in.
[02:14:35.239 --> 02:14:35.779]  Imagine.
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:42.201]  He's telling you that the Republicans say America sucks.
[02:14:42.241 --> 02:14:43.621]  No, it's the Democrats saying it sucks.
[02:14:44.061 --> 02:14:45.161]  They say it shouldn't exist.
[02:14:45.241 --> 02:14:46.442]  They're the ones saying everything's over.
[02:14:46.462 --> 02:14:49.582]  They're the ones funding the riots, trying to kill the dollar, trying to keep the lockdown going.
[02:14:49.722 --> 02:14:50.963]  Anyone with a brain knows that.
[02:14:51.243 --> 02:14:53.083]  But their constituents are in double think.
[02:14:53.423 --> 02:14:55.804]  They actually think it's Trump causing all this.
[02:14:55.824 --> 02:14:56.624]  Colbert doesn't.
[02:14:58.124 --> 02:14:59.865]  But their millions, their viewers do.
[02:14:59.925 --> 02:15:00.205]  Here it is.
[02:15:00.225 --> 02:15:00.525]  Continue.
[02:15:01.288 --> 02:15:05.331]  Just like the Democrats, the GOP has given each night of the convention a different theme.
[02:15:05.992 --> 02:15:09.554]  I believe the four nights are Famine, Pestilence, War, and Death.
[02:15:09.574 --> 02:15:18.201]  Okay, I'm being told the actual themes are Land of Promise, Land of Opportunity, Land of Heroes, and Land of Greatness.
[02:15:18.941 --> 02:15:22.524]  Better luck next time, Lando Lakes and Lando Calrissian.
[02:15:22.544 --> 02:15:27.368]  Though Lando, Lando, you definitely would have gotten a lot of camera time tonight.
[02:15:28.766 --> 02:15:34.911]  The Democratic National Convention closed with Joe Biden's warning that we have to overcome a season of darkness.
[02:15:35.692 --> 02:15:38.995]  Well, this week, darkness gets their turn at bat.
[02:15:39.395 --> 02:15:52.707]  And lo, though we walk through the valley of the shadow of douche, let's get right to week two of... Get him the hell out of here, will you please?
[02:15:57.316 --> 02:16:02.958]  Again, for radio listeners, it's, uh, the evil forces of... Be best.
[02:16:05.199 --> 02:16:06.780]  What's the bad guy's name in the Avengers?
[02:16:06.980 --> 02:16:07.760]  I'm Mike Pence!
[02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:08.600]  Thanos.
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:09.281]  Thanos.
[02:16:09.301 --> 02:16:10.881]  I don't take responsibility at all.
[02:16:16.004 --> 02:16:18.685]  But at least they said Trump is incompetent.
[02:16:18.725 --> 02:16:21.266]  Now they're saying he's the most powerful being in the universe.
[02:16:21.306 --> 02:16:21.526]  Yeah.
[02:16:24.404 --> 02:16:26.526]  And you know, Thanos was a eugenicist.
[02:16:26.546 --> 02:16:28.868]  You know, Republicans are not eugenicists.
[02:16:28.888 --> 02:16:30.590]  I am Batman, Dad!
[02:16:30.910 --> 02:16:32.451]  Oh yeah, no, no, the Democrats are Thanos.
[02:16:33.132 --> 02:16:34.173]  Well, he's doing his devil smile.
[02:16:42.110 --> 02:16:48.435]  Batman, maybe people out there might see that little graphic beautifully done by our graphics department.
[02:16:48.975 --> 02:16:53.298]  They might think it's unfair to compare Donald Trump to a guy who erased half the world's population.
[02:16:53.559 --> 02:17:00.424]  But to those people I say, 177,000 Americans are dead from Trump pretending COVID would just magically go away.
[02:17:00.744 --> 02:17:07.089]  And according to a new CBS News poll, 57% of Republicans find that death toll acceptable.
[02:17:07.705 --> 02:17:09.166]  Yeah, it's just truly, it's truly, truly sick.
[02:17:30.796 --> 02:17:34.217]  What you're seeing there is that's politically good, right?
[02:17:34.357 --> 02:17:40.920]  It's politically good that they want to say that their politics are bad, that their politics are occupy the Republicans.
[02:17:40.940 --> 02:17:44.061]  So that clearly says that the Democrats do not believe they can get out their base.
[02:17:44.481 --> 02:17:45.862]  They need to go after the middle.
[02:17:45.902 --> 02:17:47.502]  They need to go after suburban women.
[02:17:47.822 --> 02:17:50.483]  They need to go after disaffected Republicans, blah, blah, blah.
[02:17:50.503 --> 02:17:51.224]  It's politically good.
[02:17:51.244 --> 02:17:59.527]  But spiritually, my heart aches because here he is simultaneously confessing to his deep little sick fetish
[02:18:00.347 --> 02:18:04.689]  While also saying, oh no, it's the good guys that believe in this stuff.
[02:18:04.749 --> 02:18:05.990]  It's just really, really sick.
[02:18:06.010 --> 02:18:06.370]  Exactly.
[02:18:06.410 --> 02:18:07.591]  He wants extermination.
[02:18:07.611 --> 02:18:08.771]  Bill Gates wants extermination.
[02:18:09.152 --> 02:18:10.372]  They want depopulation.
[02:18:10.412 --> 02:18:11.493]  They admit all this.
[02:18:11.893 --> 02:18:13.354]  And then he's up there saying that's who we are.
[02:18:13.374 --> 02:18:17.536]  In fact, here's the part where he inverts it, where he says Republicans are the party of death.
[02:18:17.596 --> 02:18:17.956]  Here it is.
[02:18:18.537 --> 02:18:19.257]  Acceptable.
[02:18:19.277 --> 02:18:24.199]  I'm going to say you don't want 57% of Republicans speaking at your funeral.
[02:18:24.220 --> 02:18:28.642]  Hey, it was a good man, eaten by dogs exactly when he should have been.
[02:18:29.727 --> 02:18:30.347]  I'm fine with it.
[02:18:32.468 --> 02:18:35.790]  So, death is one plank of the Republican platform.
[02:18:36.030 --> 02:18:37.851]  What else does the GOP stand for?
[02:18:38.051 --> 02:18:38.511]  No one knows.
[02:18:39.112 --> 02:18:44.594]  Because it was announced last night that the GOP will not write a 2020 platform.
[02:18:44.634 --> 02:18:44.895]  Bull.
[02:18:45.235 --> 02:18:49.577]  Well, that makes sense given how much Trump struggles to get down from platforms.
[02:18:51.015 --> 02:18:51.676]  But here's the deal.
[02:18:52.136 --> 02:18:55.919]  The platform defines what a political party believes in.
[02:18:56.680 --> 02:18:59.963]  And we're being joined now by RNC spokesman Carl Hungus.
[02:19:00.703 --> 02:19:04.106]  Uh, Mr. Hungus, can you explain why you don't need a platform this year?
[02:19:04.126 --> 02:19:06.569]  He believes in nothing, Lebowski, nothing.
[02:19:07.770 --> 02:19:09.251]  The other guy's Lebowski, just call me dude.
[02:19:10.964 --> 02:19:16.486]  Instead of writing a new platform, the RNC is going to stick with its 2016 platform.
[02:19:16.566 --> 02:19:17.966]  Sure, because nothing changed since 2016.
[02:19:18.087 --> 02:19:19.587]  Let's stop there.
[02:19:19.767 --> 02:19:20.207]  Exactly.
[02:19:20.227 --> 02:19:22.568]  They said, our values then are our values now.
[02:19:22.628 --> 02:19:23.408]  We've got a lot of it done.
[02:19:23.428 --> 02:19:24.289]  We're going to get more done.
[02:19:24.769 --> 02:19:27.450]  They spend being honest as deceptive.
[02:19:27.470 --> 02:19:30.371]  Why would you change a platform when you're trying to commit to something?
[02:19:31.001 --> 02:19:39.769]  You know, usually what happens is, you know, there's a platform committee and, um, you know, Senator, uh, Senator Blackburn, you know, when she was a Congresswoman, she would run it.
[02:19:39.809 --> 02:19:42.631]  She's really, really, really good at, at that gavel.
[02:19:42.972 --> 02:19:48.957]  And so what would normally happen is you update a couple of portions to reflect a different nominee.
[02:19:49.037 --> 02:19:52.400]  We have the same nominee, so we keep the same platform.
[02:19:52.660 --> 02:19:56.404]  What they're doing, Alex, is they're actually just trying to piss off Jared Kushner.
[02:19:56.704 --> 02:19:56.824]  We're
[02:20:16.352 --> 02:20:16.712]  Everything!
[02:20:16.772 --> 02:20:18.013]  I'm really pissed watching this.
[02:20:18.073 --> 02:20:19.014]  I hadn't seen this clip.
[02:20:19.294 --> 02:20:25.718]  The left can't meme either because the Thanos thing is actually a 2020 Democrat meme.
[02:20:25.738 --> 02:20:33.102]  I forgot which candidate put it out and they just retooled it for broadcast television and you and I know and you really got to talk to your viewers about this.
[02:20:33.422 --> 02:20:35.424]  There's a difference between internet television
[02:20:36.084 --> 02:20:41.387]  There's a difference between cable television and what Stephen Colbert is doing is he's talking on broadcast television.
[02:20:41.607 --> 02:20:48.171]  He's talking to millions and millions of mainstream, low-information, retired people, and he's just spreading misinformation.
[02:20:48.471 --> 02:20:49.512]  It really ticks me off.
[02:20:49.952 --> 02:20:51.533]  And that's putting it pretty politely.
[02:20:51.593 --> 02:20:52.994]  I really, really am.
[02:20:53.014 --> 02:20:53.754]  He knows what he's doing.
[02:20:53.794 --> 02:20:56.956]  Paul Joseph Watson takes over right now from Summit.News.
[02:20:57.136 --> 02:20:59.138]  You need to get your storable food now while you can.
[02:20:59.898 --> 02:21:02.018]  Just like the guns are all sold out, the food's going to be sold out.
[02:21:02.038 --> 02:21:04.639]  But now it's one to two weeks for shipping.
[02:21:05.079 --> 02:21:05.759]  We have the food.
[02:21:05.779 --> 02:21:06.920]  It's got to be packaged and shipped out.
[02:21:06.980 --> 02:21:07.620]  It's high quality.
[02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:08.720]  It's the food you need.
[02:21:08.800 --> 02:21:10.020]  Don't procrastinate.
[02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:12.421]  For all the craziness coming, you need storable food right now.
[02:21:12.761 --> 02:21:14.581]  And we've got free shipping on a bunch of the supplements.
[02:21:14.861 --> 02:21:15.741]  That ends this Sunday.
[02:21:15.981 --> 02:21:16.862]  So take advantage of that sale.
[02:21:16.902 --> 02:21:22.563]  And we have the fluoride-free new toothpaste that's amazing, that has good, clean, super high quality.
[02:21:23.223 --> 02:21:27.744]  Activated charcoal and the mouthwash and it is enamel safe and it funds our operation.
[02:21:28.065 --> 02:21:31.566]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:21:31.826 --> 02:21:35.547]  Paul Joseph Watson from Her Majesty's London, England takes over now.
[02:21:37.287 --> 02:21:37.828]  Thanks Alex.
[02:21:37.848 --> 02:21:40.588]  Yeah, we got about a minute and a half before the break.
[02:21:40.969 --> 02:21:42.969]  So I'm just going to lay the table out for what we're going to cover.
[02:21:43.529 --> 02:21:48.671]  Democrats starting to get somewhat nervous about these riots, about these polls.
[02:21:49.235 --> 02:21:57.140]  Of course we've seen them justify the riots, the looting, the mayhem, the physical attacks for the past three months, or ignore them entirely.
[02:21:57.580 --> 02:22:05.725]  Now they're finally starting to realise the actual damage this is doing to Joe Biden in the polls, given that he himself has basically said
[02:22:06.519 --> 02:22:07.779]  He's barely going to travel.
[02:22:07.839 --> 02:22:09.200]  He's barely going to campaign.
[02:22:09.640 --> 02:22:16.421]  So he's just going to rely on the already unreliable polls that said he had a 14-point lead back in early June.
[02:22:16.441 --> 02:22:27.924]  The problem with that is that that lead has shrunk, according to the CNN poll last week, to four points after almost three months solid of rioting and mayhem on American streets.
[02:22:28.364 --> 02:22:31.785]  And we saw that again last night with Kyle Rittenhouse,
[02:22:32.386 --> 02:22:44.832]  This 17-year-old individual, a Blue Lives Matter supporter, who is actually a medic, tending to Black Lives Matter rioters, but now apparently he's a white supremacist, shooting people clearly in self-defense.
[02:22:44.852 --> 02:22:46.693]  He's been charged with first-degree murder.
[02:22:47.013 --> 02:22:52.096]  The media is spinning the hell out of it because they're so paranoid about losing control of this narrative.
[02:22:52.136 --> 02:22:53.536]  We'll be back to talk about it.
[02:22:53.836 --> 02:22:55.857]  Don't go away.
[02:22:55.877 --> 02:23:01.260]  17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse, a Blue Lives Matter supporter, a medic,
[02:23:01.852 --> 02:23:09.756]  who was on the scene last night in Wisconsin to help Black Lives Matter supporters medically give aid to them.
[02:23:10.397 --> 02:23:29.988]  He finds himself embroiled in a conflict where he's being chased by three different people, one of whom has a gun pointing at him, one of whom tried to whack him over the head with a skateboard, one of whom throws a Molotov cocktail at him, and then, according to the footage that I've seen, another guy tries to aim a kick at him.
[02:23:30.646 --> 02:23:32.226]  Kyle Rittenhouse was armed.
[02:23:32.586 --> 02:23:37.067]  Kyle Rittenhouse, under Wisconsin law, defended himself.
[02:23:37.647 --> 02:23:39.528]  He acted in self-defense.
[02:23:39.968 --> 02:23:40.968]  That's the story.
[02:23:41.428 --> 02:23:43.069]  So how's the media reporting it?
[02:23:43.669 --> 02:23:48.230]  Evil white supremacist brutally murders virtuous Black Lives Matter supporters.
[02:23:49.330 --> 02:23:52.190]  That's basically the narrative they're going with.
[02:23:52.531 --> 02:23:53.051]  Headline.
[02:23:53.931 --> 02:23:59.732]  Illinois teenager charged with first-degree murder after fatally shooting two people in Wisconsin.
[02:24:00.572 --> 02:24:07.076]  Again, the prosecutor went straight ahead with his charges, even though under the law, which I'm going to read in a second, it's clearly self-defense.
[02:24:07.697 --> 02:24:07.997]  Why?
[02:24:08.017 --> 02:24:10.359]  To satiate the mob.
[02:24:11.539 --> 02:24:13.221]  The kid had already been doxxed.
[02:24:13.641 --> 02:24:16.643]  I mean, if they didn't throw him in jail, he'd probably be lynched by now.
[02:24:17.564 --> 02:24:27.090]  Police have now arrested Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, for the fatal shooting of two protesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, late Tuesday night.
[02:24:27.642 --> 02:24:33.085]  He was arrested Wednesday afternoon and charged with first-degree intentional homicide.
[02:24:33.505 --> 02:24:34.005]  Really?
[02:24:34.605 --> 02:24:35.766]  Have they watched the video?
[02:24:35.786 --> 02:24:49.613]  Then they have all these Black Lives Matter leftists today showing a video of him walking towards the police after the incident, again, still armed, saying, Oh my God, look how they treat him with kid gloves.
[02:24:49.693 --> 02:24:51.794]  If this was a black man, they'd have shot him dead.
[02:24:52.334 --> 02:24:54.595]  Just like they took Dylan Roof to Burger King.
[02:24:55.191 --> 02:25:07.393]  There were multiple videos from the same city on Monday night of armed Black Lives Matter supporters walking around with guns, aiming them at SWAT vehicles in some instances.
[02:25:07.633 --> 02:25:09.833]  The police did nothing.
[02:25:10.914 --> 02:25:13.134]  They did nothing, so how is it any different?
[02:25:13.774 --> 02:25:24.476]  And the fact that this is being framed as first-degree intentional homicide, when the guy's clearly defending himself from either being shot or beaten to death,
[02:25:25.589 --> 02:25:26.870]  Is absolutely incredible.
[02:25:28.511 --> 02:25:31.892]  And in fact, David Steinberg has tweeted about this, which I retweeted earlier.
[02:25:32.492 --> 02:25:46.119]  Given what we know from the video footage, given that we know the Molotov cocktail was thrown at him, a guy aimed a kick to his face, which as we saw a few days ago, or last week, with the guy in Portland, that could have killed him alone.
[02:25:46.860 --> 02:25:53.483]  The guy who he shot in the arm was carrying a pistol both before and after the confrontation and pointing it at him.
[02:25:54.153 --> 02:25:57.394]  Another guy tried to whack him over the head with a skateboard.
[02:25:57.414 --> 02:25:59.314]  Again, that kind of assault can kill a man.
[02:26:00.834 --> 02:26:02.875]  So clearly grounds for self-defense.
[02:26:03.415 --> 02:26:06.976]  Clearly it's a tragedy all around for the people who died.
[02:26:07.216 --> 02:26:09.536]  Two of the three people he shot are dead.
[02:26:10.597 --> 02:26:20.459]  But again, if you're chasing after a guy on the street threatening to beat his ass when he's got a shotgun or an AR-15 in this case, not a very wise decision to make.
[02:26:20.839 --> 02:26:21.859]  Not a very wise decision.
[02:26:22.458 --> 02:26:24.599]  But here's how the Washington Post is reporting it.
[02:26:25.359 --> 02:26:27.619]  This is from a tweet by David Steinberg.
[02:26:28.439 --> 02:26:33.160]  Video shows a man sprinting toward a man standing with a rifle and throws a Molotov cocktail at him.
[02:26:33.461 --> 02:26:35.261]  He doesn't fire back, he runs away.
[02:26:36.541 --> 02:26:37.742]  That's exactly what happened.
[02:26:38.662 --> 02:26:42.043]  The 17-year-old kid ran away, tried to get away at first.
[02:26:42.663 --> 02:26:45.063]  The assailant keeps charging and catches up.
[02:26:45.403 --> 02:26:48.404]  Now he shoots at point-blank, then runs away down the street.
[02:26:49.364 --> 02:26:51.486]  That's what happened, and you've seen the video by now.
[02:26:51.946 --> 02:26:54.328]  This is how the Washington Post reported on it.
[02:26:54.348 --> 02:26:57.911]  It says shots were fired around 11.45pm.
[02:26:58.651 --> 02:27:04.876]  After the first shots, a young white man... Oh, by the way, they tried to claim he was a white supremacist.
[02:27:04.916 --> 02:27:07.318]  That's literally been all over the British news as well.
[02:27:07.758 --> 02:27:09.659]  Zero evidence of that whatsoever.
[02:27:09.940 --> 02:27:14.963]  He wasn't part of a Boogaloo group, or a white supremacist group, from everything that's come out so far.
[02:27:15.584 --> 02:27:16.765]  So they emphasise white,
[02:27:17.921 --> 02:27:23.902]  White man carrying a rifle began running north on Sheridan Road away from a crowd of protesters.
[02:27:25.222 --> 02:27:29.503]  Doesn't mention the fact that four of them were running after him and one of them was armed.
[02:27:30.583 --> 02:27:36.084]  This is the absolute 180 to the truth that they shoved down the American people's throats.
[02:27:36.664 --> 02:27:41.125]  And most of them buy it because they don't go on Twitter and look at the actual video of what happened.
[02:27:43.145 --> 02:27:47.326]  It says, video shows the armed man fall to the ground and then fire
[02:27:48.444 --> 02:27:50.545]  Multiple rounds into the crowd.
[02:27:51.006 --> 02:27:51.626]  What crowd?
[02:27:51.946 --> 02:27:55.149]  The crowd that's chasing him down, trying to beat his brains out?
[02:27:55.429 --> 02:27:56.109]  Oh, that crowd.
[02:27:56.550 --> 02:27:59.191]  The crowd that's armed, pointing guns at him?
[02:27:59.692 --> 02:28:00.192]  That crowd.
[02:28:00.232 --> 02:28:01.093]  They don't mention that.
[02:28:02.073 --> 02:28:03.795]  You would think that'd be an important detail.
[02:28:04.075 --> 02:28:05.416]  No mention of it whatsoever.
[02:28:06.517 --> 02:28:08.278]  There's two more people fell to the ground.
[02:28:09.278 --> 02:28:10.239]  One shot in the arm.
[02:28:10.599 --> 02:28:13.722]  The guy who was shot in the arm was carrying a gun and pointing it at him.
[02:28:14.342 --> 02:28:15.183]  Don't mention that.
[02:28:16.043 --> 02:28:17.024]  And the other in the chest.
[02:28:18.058 --> 02:28:23.100]  Another graphic video shows a man with blood running down the back of his neck and bystanders shouting that he'd been shot in the head.
[02:28:23.681 --> 02:28:28.823]  And that was the guy, by the way, which I'm going to get onto, who they're all saying, CALL THE POLICE!
[02:28:30.144 --> 02:28:33.465]  You mean the same police that you want to defund and abolish?
[02:28:34.185 --> 02:28:39.428]  The same police that you were throwing bricks at and knocking them out in the head two nights ago?
[02:28:39.448 --> 02:28:41.209]  Oh yeah, call the police.
[02:28:42.529 --> 02:28:46.171]  A Washington Post video journalist, Whitney Leming,
[02:28:46.983 --> 02:28:47.684]  Appropriate name.
[02:28:48.184 --> 02:28:54.809]  Said that after gunfire erupted about a block away, the man with the rifle ran past her with a few protesters in pursuit.
[02:28:55.209 --> 02:28:59.152]  He tripped and fell, then rolled- tripped and fell, they were literally hot on his tail.
[02:28:59.773 --> 02:29:02.755]  Throwing things at him, throwing Molotov cocktails at him.
[02:29:03.335 --> 02:29:04.376]  Oh, but he just tripped.
[02:29:06.578 --> 02:29:13.183]  Then rolled into a sitting position, raised his gun and opened fire at his pursuers, who were threatening to kill him, and trying to kill him.
[02:29:13.563 --> 02:29:15.004]  They leave that little part out.
[02:29:15.865 --> 02:29:16.345]  So again,
[02:29:17.403 --> 02:29:21.485]  Washington Post claiming that this guy is firing into a crowd.
[02:29:21.925 --> 02:29:25.667]  They don't mention that any of the people pursuing him are armed.
[02:29:26.187 --> 02:29:32.831]  One of whom with a Molotov cocktail, one of whom with a skateboard, which he tried to whack him over the head with, and another with a gun!
[02:29:34.692 --> 02:29:36.332]  Another guy tried to kick him in the head.
[02:29:36.673 --> 02:29:41.695]  Don't mention any of that, because that kind of changes the narrative, doesn't it?
[02:29:42.696 --> 02:29:45.437]  Marina Medvin has tweeted this.
[02:29:46.414 --> 02:29:48.075]  Wisconsin self-defense law.
[02:29:48.535 --> 02:29:49.595]  Defendant must prove 1.
[02:29:50.416 --> 02:29:54.618]  He reasonably believed he was preventing slash terminating unlawful interference.
[02:29:54.838 --> 02:29:55.638]  That's guaranteed.
[02:29:55.658 --> 02:29:55.638]  2.
[02:29:57.939 --> 02:30:03.361]  He reasonably believed that force was necessary while he was about to be beaten to death.
[02:30:03.802 --> 02:30:05.542]  I would think that would be kind of necessary.
[02:30:06.203 --> 02:30:07.703]  What would you do in that situation? 3.
[02:30:10.228 --> 02:30:14.029]  Actual amount of force use was necessary to prevent the interference.
[02:30:14.169 --> 02:30:18.331]  Guy was pointing a gun at him and saying, let's get him, let's beat his ass.
[02:30:18.551 --> 02:30:20.492]  I would say he's got a pretty good defense.
[02:30:21.292 --> 02:30:22.633]  A pretty good defense.
[02:30:24.173 --> 02:30:36.618]  She continues, Wisconsin law for first-degree intentional homicide is pasted below, as are all the mitigating circumstances for reduction of the charge, not to mention full-out defenses that he will have.
[02:30:36.678 --> 02:30:37.738]  She makes the point, quote,
[02:30:38.231 --> 02:30:40.233]  Liberals always overcharge.
[02:30:40.253 --> 02:30:55.968]  So they're hitting this guy within hours or even minutes of his arrest with intentional homicide murder charges despite the fact that all the evidence clearly shows under Wisconsin law he acted in self-defense.
[02:30:56.008 --> 02:30:57.430]  And why are they doing that?
[02:30:58.230 --> 02:30:59.492]  To satiate the mob.
[02:30:59.572 --> 02:31:02.855]  They're probably doing it because they think, oh if we do this they won't burn down
[02:31:03.502 --> 02:31:07.123]  More businesses tonight, more shops, etc, etc.
[02:31:07.203 --> 02:31:07.964]  And you know they will.
[02:31:08.144 --> 02:31:08.764]  You know they will.
[02:31:08.844 --> 02:31:10.344]  Because it's not about justice.
[02:31:10.464 --> 02:31:11.425]  It's about anarchy.
[02:31:11.885 --> 02:31:12.705]  It's about mayhem.
[02:31:12.985 --> 02:31:14.986]  It's about subversion.
[02:31:15.066 --> 02:31:19.187]  And it's coming right from the top of the democratic complex.
[02:31:19.868 --> 02:31:27.430]  That's what we're going to get on to talk about in the next segment, because they're starting to get nervous about how this is affecting the polls and how it's helping Trump.
[02:31:27.750 --> 02:31:28.791]  We'll be back to talk about it.
[02:31:28.831 --> 02:31:29.971]  Summit.News, don't go away.
[02:31:30.891 --> 02:31:35.994]  Well, self-defense is now trending on Twitter, I notice, for a very good reason.
[02:31:36.094 --> 02:31:38.716]  It's probably full of leftists decrying the notion of it.
[02:31:39.476 --> 02:31:40.177]  But imagine this.
[02:31:40.257 --> 02:31:51.483]  Imagine if a black man, imagine if an African-American Black Lives Matter supporter had shot three, quote, white supremacists, one of whom was armed with a gun.
[02:31:52.324 --> 02:31:56.226]  Not that the 17-year-old kid was even a white supremacist, but let's just say it for argument's sake.
[02:31:56.806 --> 02:31:57.787]  If an African-American
[02:31:58.186 --> 02:32:12.034]  BLM supporter had shot three white supremacists, one of whom was armed and pointing a gun at him, another of whom was throwing Molotov cocktails at him, another of whom was trying to kick him in the head, another of whom was trying to whack him in the head with a skateboard.
[02:32:13.055 --> 02:32:26.143]  If that African-American Black Lives Matter supporter had, in self-defense, while these three white supremacists pursued, chased, threatened to beat him and did beat him, pointed guns at him,
[02:32:26.843 --> 02:32:31.204]  If he had shot those three white supremacists, what would be happening today in the news?
[02:32:31.844 --> 02:32:43.207]  The media would be venerating him, praising him, celebrating him, decrying his arrest, launching a vociferous self-defense narrow campaign.
[02:32:44.247 --> 02:32:50.989]  And Black Lives Matter would probably, by the end of the month or by the end of next month, be erecting statues of him, especially if he had died.
[02:32:52.089 --> 02:32:54.650]  Absolutely incredible, yet this kid, this 17-year-old,
[02:32:55.922 --> 02:33:04.887]  was identified, doxxed, and arrested and charged with first-degree intentional homicide within 12 hours of all this happening.
[02:33:06.188 --> 02:33:09.009]  And what's going on in regards to the incident that started this?
[02:33:10.090 --> 02:33:17.254]  This Jacob Blake, who was shot seven times, is still alive, apparently paralyzed from the waist down.
[02:33:18.475 --> 02:33:24.098]  As a result of what we were told was him trying to break up an argument between some people on a road.
[02:33:24.608 --> 02:33:25.849]  Again, completely innocent.
[02:33:26.970 --> 02:33:29.012]  The assumption of no criminal record whatsoever.
[02:33:29.052 --> 02:33:30.793]  Turns out you've got a vast criminal record.
[02:33:31.214 --> 02:33:33.215]  Was literally a sex offender.
[02:33:34.416 --> 02:33:35.577]  What's going on with that?
[02:33:35.597 --> 02:33:40.141]  Well, it turns out that the entire narrative that we were force-fed was completely wrong yet again.
[02:33:40.201 --> 02:33:41.202]  Well, what a surprise.
[02:33:41.822 --> 02:33:42.323]  Headline.
[02:33:43.304 --> 02:33:47.307]  Kenosha police opened fire less than five minutes after being called.
[02:33:47.888 --> 02:33:48.808]  Scanner audio.
[02:33:49.749 --> 02:33:51.771]  Kenosha police scanner audio indicates police
[02:33:52.534 --> 02:33:58.856]  By the way, this is after he scuffled with officers and, according to a lot of images, was carrying a knife, as he opens his car door and leans inside.
[02:34:17.256 --> 02:34:20.578]  One of the officers grabs Blake by the back of his shirt and seven shots can be heard.
[02:34:20.618 --> 02:34:22.939]  He remains in serious condition in a Milwaukee hospital.
[02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:35.226]  But according to the audio obtained by Madison365, someone called police to report that Blake was at her home and wasn't supposed to be, and that he had taken her keys and was refusing to give them back.
[02:34:35.627 --> 02:34:42.170]  So far from Blake breaking up a fight, as we were told from the very start of this story.
[02:34:42.250 --> 02:34:44.772]  Kind of important, the genesis of the story, isn't it?
[02:34:45.680 --> 02:34:51.502]  Actually turns out that he was inside someone's home, home invasion by the looks of it, against their will.
[02:34:52.202 --> 02:34:53.703]  And it was a domestic dispute.
[02:34:54.803 --> 02:35:05.267]  About 30 seconds later, she let patrol officers know there was an alert at this address for a 99 for this subject, apparently to indicate that a warrant had been issued for Blake's arrest.
[02:35:05.807 --> 02:35:11.309]  Court records indicate a warrant was issued on three charges, two misdemeanors and one G-class felony.
[02:35:11.369 --> 02:35:12.690]  So again, yet another criminal
[02:35:13.422 --> 02:35:18.083]  Threatening somebody, or he's just another angel trying to break up a fight.
[02:35:18.824 --> 02:35:27.786]  Brandon Taton, who by the way is African American, former police officer, has been pilloried by the media today for telling the truth about this.
[02:35:27.927 --> 02:35:29.587]  This is a headline out of The Sun.
[02:35:30.847 --> 02:35:37.750]  Outspoken black ex-cop defends Jacob Blake shooting, claiming his criminal record shows he pulled guns, sparking fury.
[02:35:38.470 --> 02:35:38.930]  Fury!
[02:35:40.413 --> 02:35:46.417]  An outspoken black ex-cop sparked fury after defending the Jacob Blake shooting, saying that the black dad already had a criminal record.
[02:35:46.777 --> 02:35:47.857]  Again, completely true.
[02:35:48.318 --> 02:35:51.740]  He was wanted on a criminal charge, that's why the police came out.
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:58.063]  In a shocking Twitter rant, Brandon Tatum branded Blake a domestic abuser and sex offender.
[02:35:58.383 --> 02:35:59.204]  Also true.
[02:35:59.664 --> 02:36:01.665]  And claimed he was known for pulling guns.
[02:36:02.966 --> 02:36:07.889]  Tatum tweeted, Your boy Jacob Blake, domestic abuser and sex offender.
[02:36:08.419 --> 02:36:11.501]  Known for pulling guns on people and living a life of crime.
[02:36:11.541 --> 02:36:13.081]  This is who you're all crying about.
[02:36:14.242 --> 02:36:25.968]  But again, besides the fact whether you thought the shooting was justified, it's the fact they have to bestow sainthood upon these criminals before we even know what happened.
[02:36:26.288 --> 02:36:28.789]  That kind of tells you how they're manipulating the narrative.
[02:36:30.310 --> 02:36:34.172]  Tatum, a former Arizona police officer, claimed that Blake had lived a life of crime.
[02:36:34.993 --> 02:36:37.474]  Claimed he posted his criminal record.
[02:36:38.706 --> 02:36:39.606]  Proof is in the pudding!
[02:36:40.247 --> 02:36:47.329]  The criminal record shows charges that include domestic abuse, disorderly conduct, and third-degree sexual assault.
[02:36:47.629 --> 02:36:49.490]  Perfect for a Black Lives Matter icon.
[02:36:49.970 --> 02:36:54.852]  Let's not forget, by the way, I labour this point, but people still don't really talk about it.
[02:36:55.312 --> 02:37:01.054]  The inspirational guru behind Black Lives Matter, the woman whose name they chant in the street,
[02:37:01.846 --> 02:37:11.189]  The literal ideologue that started their movement was the inspiration behind it, is a convicted cop killing terrorists on the FBI's most wanted list.
[02:37:12.449 --> 02:37:14.430]  She's called a Sartre-Chacon, look it up.
[02:37:15.090 --> 02:37:24.813]  Can you imagine if a right-wing extremist political group had named someone like Timothy McVeigh as their inspirational guru?
[02:37:25.093 --> 02:37:26.333]  Would the media support them?
[02:37:28.058 --> 02:37:32.099]  Would football stars, would celebrities be taking a knee in support of them?
[02:37:32.219 --> 02:37:34.020]  It's absolutely asinine.
[02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:46.103]  So basically, this Blake individual, tragic as though his shooting was, was a career criminal, a convicted sex offender.
[02:37:46.823 --> 02:37:56.526]  According to the photographs and the video, he was carrying a knife, he was squabbling with police officers, he was not breaking up a fight, he was in somebody's house against their will,
[02:37:57.540 --> 02:37:58.641]  He goes into his car.
[02:37:58.681 --> 02:38:00.002]  They don't know what he's reaching for.
[02:38:00.042 --> 02:38:00.562]  They kill him.
[02:38:01.843 --> 02:38:04.164]  A little bit different from what we've been told by the media.
[02:38:06.266 --> 02:38:07.647]  This is how it's affecting the polls.
[02:38:07.687 --> 02:38:08.927]  This is what people really want to know.
[02:38:09.708 --> 02:38:11.829]  Has this had any effect on the polls?
[02:38:12.089 --> 02:38:25.258]  Is this going to have the effect of people voting for Biden simply because they want four years of peace and they've been intimidated by the mob into genuflecting and into submitting to the Black Lives Matter mob?
[02:38:26.031 --> 02:38:29.833]  Or is it only going to embolden people to vote again for Trump?
[02:38:30.313 --> 02:38:32.974]  Or is it going to embolden any of the moderates to vote for Trump?
[02:38:33.595 --> 02:38:51.303]  Given that we know people are literally emptying out of New York City, Portland, Seattle, and all these other major cities, Los Angeles, fleeing to the suburbs, are they still going to virtue signal and allow their country to be completely subverted and think they can ride it out in the Hamptons?
[02:38:51.663 --> 02:38:53.364]  Or are they actually going to vote differently?
[02:38:54.870 --> 02:39:00.291]  Well, we have this headline, violent crime now almost as important to American voters as coronavirus.
[02:39:00.352 --> 02:39:08.174]  Of course, the Democrats have been pushing coronavirus as the be-all and end-all subject for the past six months plus.
[02:39:08.814 --> 02:39:14.775]  It's down at number four on the list of most important election issues for Americans.
[02:39:15.476 --> 02:39:24.038]  And now a new poll has found that almost as many American voters now view violent crime as an important election issue compared to coronavirus.
[02:39:26.107 --> 02:39:42.163]  So 59% of voters, this is a Pew Research poll taken in the last couple of days, 59% of voters indicate that violent crime, which President Trump has framed as happening in Democrat-controlled cities, is a very important factor in casting their ballots.
[02:39:43.564 --> 02:39:50.711]  So it's the fourth, sorry, coronavirus is the fourth most important issue, with 63% concerned about COVID.
[02:39:52.182 --> 02:39:56.426]  And then the fifth most important issue, but rising quickly, is violent crime.
[02:39:56.446 --> 02:40:09.638]  And then when you drill into the numbers, 74% of Trump supporters view violent crime as an important issue, but 46% of likely Biden voters view it as an important issue too.
[02:40:10.666 --> 02:40:24.233]  So if they want to extinguish violent crime and these kind of relentless riots, bedlam and mayhem that we've seen for the past three months, and if they think Biden's not going to do anything about it, are they really going to have the enthusiasm to go out and vote for Biden?
[02:40:24.754 --> 02:40:36.740]  Given that he himself has said that he's basically not even traveling, not even campaigning properly, can't even string a sentence together, refuses to denounce these riots, this mayhem, this looting,
[02:40:38.365 --> 02:40:55.270]  Are those virtue signallers who tell pollsters that they're going to vote for Biden, simply because they're scared of saying the word Trump, orange man bad, are they actually going to show up on election day given that this concern about violent crime amongst American voters seems to be increasing?
[02:40:55.430 --> 02:40:56.411]  We'll be back, no go away.
[02:40:57.291 --> 02:41:06.154]  We had a headline on InfoWars a few days ago, Study Links Rampant Victimhood Virtue Signalling to Dark Triad Personalities.
[02:41:07.139 --> 02:41:23.948]  Basically making the argument that dark triad personalities, narcissists, psychopaths and Machiavellian people are more likely to engage in virtue signalling and feigned victimhood in order to extract resources, attention and sympathy from others.
[02:41:24.528 --> 02:41:27.570]  I did a video on this and this clip is part of that video.
[02:41:28.194 --> 02:41:42.603]  Contrasting how Twitter cancel culture, which is derived from this same fabricated victimhood and virtue signaling, has many hallmarks in common with the Salem Witch Trials from over 300 years ago.
[02:41:42.623 --> 02:41:43.944]  I'm going to play this clip.
[02:41:44.124 --> 02:41:44.484]  Here it is.
[02:41:46.024 --> 02:41:49.746]  A large component of virtue signaling is Twitter cancel culture.
[02:41:49.806 --> 02:41:58.089]  Joining the mob in a pile-on against whoever's turn it is to be harassed and publicly shamed for a ten-year-old tweet is itself a virtue signal.
[02:41:58.109 --> 02:42:04.411]  By juxtaposing themselves against the wickedness of the accused, they seek to obtain reflective virtue.
[02:42:04.471 --> 02:42:10.654]  By hoisting a metaphorical pitchfork and joining the unhinged rabble, they too can burn the witch.
[02:42:10.834 --> 02:42:18.342]  Which is interesting, because a not-too-dissimilar thing happened 320 years ago during the Salem Witch Trials.
[02:42:18.383 --> 02:42:28.053]  Just like Twitter cancel culture and deplatforming, in Salem, Massachusetts, the original witches to be accused were individuals who were disliked by the community.
[02:42:28.113 --> 02:42:31.017]  Malcontents, antisocials, weirdos, slaves.
[02:42:31.337 --> 02:42:37.240]  The first three women accused were in one form or another outcasts in the village.
[02:42:37.340 --> 02:42:43.744]  Since few would rush to their defense, it was far easier to portray their motives as malevolent and impugn their character.
[02:42:43.784 --> 02:42:50.968]  But then as the moral panic grew, the finger of blame increasingly began to be pointed at more upstanding members of the community.
[02:42:51.028 --> 02:42:58.272]  Martha Corey was a full-fledged, full covenant member of the Salem Village Church.
[02:42:59.557 --> 02:43:02.498]  If Martha Corey could be a witch, then anyone could be.
[02:43:02.558 --> 02:43:06.279]  How far has the needle moved on social media in terms of deplatforming?
[02:43:06.319 --> 02:43:11.601]  From affecting controversial or offensive figures, to those considered more mainstream.
[02:43:11.741 --> 02:43:20.544]  Back in Salem, Massachusetts, as the hysterical contagion of the witch hunt spiraled out of control, it began to ensnare people who thought they were safe.
[02:43:20.744 --> 02:43:26.786]  In Salem, this came to a head when a former minister of the village, Reverend George Burroughs, was accused of being a witch.
[02:43:26.946 --> 02:43:36.249]  It came to a head when Martha Corey and Rebecca Nurse, two of the most benevolent members of the community and both devout church members, were accused of being witches.
[02:43:36.329 --> 02:43:39.550]  Nurse's sister, Sarah Cloyce, was also accused of being a witch.
[02:43:40.010 --> 02:43:40.330]  Why?
[02:43:40.951 --> 02:43:42.471]  Because she defended her sister.
[02:43:42.671 --> 02:43:45.092]  Is Twitter cancel culture that different?
[02:43:45.772 --> 02:43:47.032]  In a way, it's much worse.
[02:43:47.132 --> 02:43:51.694]  Not only will you become a target of the mob if you defend another target of the mob,
[02:43:51.834 --> 02:43:55.459]  But you can also become a target merely if you try to remain silent.
[02:43:55.579 --> 02:43:58.543]  Remember what they say, white silence is violence.
[02:43:58.703 --> 02:44:01.827]  But who was responsible for the Salem Witch accusations?
[02:44:01.927 --> 02:44:05.753]  Who comprised the woke mob of the late 17th century?
[02:44:05.853 --> 02:44:09.738]  How did accusations alone become enough to confirm someone's guilt?
[02:44:09.878 --> 02:44:17.646]  The accusations in Salem were made by a group of young girls who had fits and claimed they were being physically attacked by spectral figures.
[02:44:17.786 --> 02:44:23.511]  Unknown at the time, the girls were simply exhibiting all the classic signs of clinical hysteria.
[02:44:23.571 --> 02:44:29.977]  But when they repeated this theatrical display of thrashing around in the courtroom and then pointed out who was to blame,
[02:44:30.618 --> 02:44:32.059]  The girls were believed.
[02:44:32.199 --> 02:44:33.299]  Hashtag believe women.
[02:44:33.339 --> 02:44:41.822]  When the girls were told to face one of the accused, Sarah Good, who was standing a considerable distance away, they immediately fell into fits and acted out being tortured.
[02:44:42.402 --> 02:44:49.665]  You are now in the hands of authority.
[02:44:49.945 --> 02:44:51.565]  Tell me now why you hurt these persons.
[02:44:51.685 --> 02:44:52.185]  I do not.
[02:44:52.245 --> 02:44:52.546]  Who does?
[02:44:55.481 --> 02:45:00.004]  After they recovered, the girls claimed that good spectre had tormented them.
[02:45:00.044 --> 02:45:06.989]  This came to be known as spectral evidence, and in many circumstances was considered satisfactory for ascertaining guilt.
[02:45:07.189 --> 02:45:09.171]  Now, what does that remind you of?
[02:45:09.251 --> 02:45:14.335]  The leftist dogma that words and non-physical abstraction can cause physical harm.
[02:45:14.415 --> 02:45:17.517]  The notion that offensive speech is violence.
[02:45:17.697 --> 02:45:20.018]  Your speech could incite the same kind of violence.
[02:45:20.038 --> 02:45:28.222]  You, a faculty member at an American public university, paid for by taxpayer dollars, are conflating speech with violence.
[02:45:29.943 --> 02:45:30.183]  Yes.
[02:45:31.944 --> 02:45:32.804]  Speech can be violent.
[02:45:34.449 --> 02:45:42.638]  So the Salem Witch accusers engaged in six different types of behavior that are mirrored by virtue signaling Twitter cancel mobs today.
[02:45:42.918 --> 02:45:48.524]  One, feigning victimhood via over-the-top theatrical displays of fabricated suffering.
[02:45:48.645 --> 02:45:50.847]  Two, claiming a non-physical abstract
[02:45:51.027 --> 02:45:57.569]  Words, speech or someone defending themselves is itself a form of physical harassment and violence.
[02:45:57.589 --> 02:45:57.569]  3.
[02:45:57.789 --> 02:46:02.190]  Establishing the accusation alone is enough to confirm guilt.
[02:46:02.210 --> 02:46:02.190]  4.
[02:46:02.310 --> 02:46:08.411]  The expectation of an immediate apology and recantation even if the accused has done nothing wrong.
[02:46:08.431 --> 02:46:08.411]  5.
[02:46:08.591 --> 02:46:15.373]  Discouraging others from defending the accused by making it clear this would incite the mob to target them next.
[02:46:15.593 --> 02:46:15.673]  And 6.
[02:46:16.753 --> 02:46:21.916]  Mindless persecution fuelled by contrived moral panic and mass hysteria.
[02:46:22.016 --> 02:46:29.379]  Just like putting the accused in the stocks 300 years ago, social media cancel culture is a form of public shaming.
[02:46:29.480 --> 02:46:32.901]  Social media cancel culture is a form of virtue signalling.
[02:46:33.021 --> 02:46:37.243]  And the Salem witch trials were the original cancel culture.
[02:46:40.205 --> 02:46:46.128]  And that is a clip from a video called Cancel Culture Psychopaths, which you can go and watch at your leisure.
[02:46:46.977 --> 02:46:56.079]  Going to get back into what's happening in Kenosha now, though, as we see the 17-year-old responsible for defending himself be charged with first-degree murder.
[02:46:56.959 --> 02:46:59.000]  Now we have a headline up on summit.news.
[02:46:59.140 --> 02:47:03.260]  Sheriff refuses to deputise citizens to restore order in Kenosha.
[02:47:03.300 --> 02:47:08.622]  Of course, you saw the governor there refused to accept support from President Trump.
[02:47:08.702 --> 02:47:15.323]  I believe in the past few hours he's actually bowed down to the demands of the people around him and accepted that support.
[02:47:15.879 --> 02:47:20.042]  So expect more National Guard to be in situation tonight.
[02:47:20.902 --> 02:47:34.811]  But Kenosha County Sheriff David Beth refused to deputize citizens to prevent rioting and mayhem in the city, while police also ordered armed business owners to stop defending their own property.
[02:47:35.538 --> 02:47:46.803]  Remember we saw this back in, I think it was 2015, in the Baltimore riots where the police actually more so went after the people trying to defend their homes and property than the rioters themselves.
[02:47:48.484 --> 02:47:58.149]  And with many armed citizens vowing to defend their safety and property from increasingly violent Black Lives Matter agitators, it appears they're not getting much support from authorities.
[02:47:59.169 --> 02:48:00.270]  The journal Sentinel
[02:48:01.434 --> 02:48:10.797]  Reported how a group of armed men with long guns were observed standing guard at a dry-cleaning business on Sheridan Road near 59th Street, some on the roof.
[02:48:11.637 --> 02:48:17.199]  The police told them to get off the roof and a person shouted back, Officer, this is our business!
[02:48:18.360 --> 02:48:20.320]  Police did not ultimately order them off the roof.
[02:48:20.360 --> 02:48:23.361]  Police did not ultimately make them get off the roof.
[02:48:24.082 --> 02:48:28.583]  But at least you see whether that came from the police themselves or whether the order came from above.
[02:48:29.283 --> 02:48:30.744]  It seems they were just as, uh,
[02:48:31.639 --> 02:48:37.482]  Nervous and worried about armed citizens defending their own property as they were the rioters themselves.
[02:48:38.543 --> 02:48:46.227]  But Sheriff Beth, when asked whether he would consider deputizing citizens to help police restore order, was unequivocal in his opposition.
[02:48:46.707 --> 02:48:49.169]  There's no way I'm doing that, Beth said.
[02:48:49.269 --> 02:48:55.412]  Well, given the abject incompetence that we've seen in that city over the past two nights, maybe it's time to do that.
[02:48:56.511 --> 02:49:03.315]  Maybe the assets that Trump has sent in after the governor finally agreed to it will help calm the situation.
[02:49:03.755 --> 02:49:04.855]  That remains to be seen.
[02:49:05.636 --> 02:49:07.837]  The only guarantee at this point is you know
[02:49:08.840 --> 02:49:14.244]  As an American citizen, you're going to wake up every morning to riots in some city somewhere.
[02:49:14.544 --> 02:49:15.405]  That's a guarantee.
[02:49:15.425 --> 02:49:16.926]  It has been for the past three months.
[02:49:17.386 --> 02:49:19.007]  It will be until the election.
[02:49:19.567 --> 02:49:35.358]  And then if Trump wins, it will be after the election, too, because Hillary Clinton has come out today and said she's not going to accept the result or she's going to advise Joe Biden to not accept the result, which, of course, is exactly what we saw on a more limited basis after the 2016 election.
[02:49:37.253 --> 02:49:43.958]  Where apparently she got so drunk and angry backstage that she couldn't even come out and give a concession speech.
[02:49:43.998 --> 02:49:47.681]  She had to get John Podesta to halfway do it for her.
[02:49:48.402 --> 02:49:53.866]  Of course there was riots for at least a week or more after Trump's initial election four years ago.
[02:49:54.947 --> 02:49:59.510]  You can bet your bottom dollar there's going to be that times ten if he wins again in 2020.
[02:50:02.412 --> 02:50:06.115]  Meanwhile, gang fires shots at Trump supporters during rally in Charlotte.
[02:50:06.135 --> 02:50:10.117]  This is another story that was reported in local media and basically no one else.
[02:50:10.678 --> 02:50:15.941]  A gang of three men fired shots from the vehicle at a group of Trump supporters during a political rally in Charlotte.
[02:50:16.502 --> 02:50:18.603]  Basically, it was a woman's organization.
[02:50:18.663 --> 02:50:20.024]  They were flying Trump flags.
[02:50:20.044 --> 02:50:21.305]  They were flying American flags.
[02:50:21.325 --> 02:50:22.346]  There were children around.
[02:50:22.706 --> 02:50:23.787]  They were standing on a bridge.
[02:50:24.647 --> 02:50:31.572]  Three gangbangers in a car drove past, start shouting obscenities, derogatory remarks, which were obviously political.
[02:50:32.076 --> 02:50:32.336]  I think?
[02:50:53.379 --> 02:50:56.862]  Former city councilman with Trump pen sign in his front yard murdered.
[02:50:56.902 --> 02:50:59.605]  That happened in Florida a few days ago.
[02:51:00.005 --> 02:51:05.971]  Police say it was a random killing despite the fact that, you know, he had the Trump pen sign in his yard.
[02:51:06.391 --> 02:51:10.735]  Authorities said there was a confrontation, but we're assured it was totally random.
[02:51:11.336 --> 02:51:12.116]  Story buried.
[02:51:12.136 --> 02:51:13.738]  That's going to wrap it up for the show.
[02:51:13.758 --> 02:51:15.579]  Summit.News, War Room is coming up next.
[02:51:15.980 --> 02:51:16.500]  Stay tuned.
[02:51:16.520 --> 02:51:17.081]  Don't go away.
[02:51:32.824 --> 02:51:35.066]  Please remember that it's down to the wire.
[02:51:36.388 --> 02:51:42.054]  When I say please tell people about Band.Video or NewsWorks.com or InfoWorks.com, people are ready to hear the truth.
[02:51:42.474 --> 02:51:44.036]  Everything is basically censored now.
[02:51:45.177 --> 02:51:46.959]  We built our own system to be able to do this.

[02:51:58.371 --> 02:52:02.496]  All these top medical doctors can't even come out and say what happened with their patients or their band.
[02:52:02.576 --> 02:52:04.918]  And now they're getting in trouble, and now they're losing their licenses.
[02:52:05.018 --> 02:52:06.119]  I mean, this is terror!
[02:52:06.380 --> 02:52:14.148]  And we're under massive attack, massive infiltration, massive globalist operations that I can't even get to on air, but your prayers are keeping us in the fight.

[02:52:36.783 --> 02:52:38.464]  If it loses, it's going to go to hell on earth.
[02:52:38.524 --> 02:52:39.525]  And I don't just say that.
[02:52:39.986 --> 02:52:42.127]  I'm having talks with my wife, my parents, my family.
