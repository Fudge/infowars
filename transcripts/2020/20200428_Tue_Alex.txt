[00:00:06.347 --> 00:00:16.169]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:00:16.169 --> 00:00:18.250]  And we're not dead yet.
[00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.311]  In fact, we're stronger than ever, hitting the final stretch.
[00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.592]  Now to complete the operation.
[00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:27.952]  It is Tuesday, April 28th.
[00:00:31.915 --> 00:00:49.165]  2020, 188 days out from the election, and we're seeing the full force of the New World Order, Marxist-Leninist system to shut off an economy, bankrupt the people, shut down the farms, and complete our journey to slavery.
[00:00:49.165 --> 00:00:56.909]  But through this process, we will yet again discover the spirit of Americana, the Renaissance in 1776, which shall set us free.
[00:01:00.752 --> 00:01:03.034]  I am zenned out.
[00:01:03.034 --> 00:01:04.395]  I am focused today.
[00:01:04.395 --> 00:01:13.684]  I have really cogitated on what needs to be done, and I am ready to deliver you the next level of the transmission.
[00:01:13.684 --> 00:01:17.968]  I hope you stay with us, but they are destroying the crops under federal orders.
[00:01:17.968 --> 00:01:19.109]  They are destroying everything.
[00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:20.970]  This is the bureaucracy doing it.
[00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.254]  American farmers being ordered to depopulate livestock, destroy crops.
[00:01:25.254 --> 00:01:25.635]  Here it is.
[00:01:27.782 --> 00:01:38.252]  Shad Sullivan, Regional Director of R-Calf USA, is a fifth-generation Colorado rancher and recently delivered this message.
[00:01:38.252 --> 00:01:45.719]  Hey everybody, this is Shad Sullivan coming to you from the headwaters of Bitter Creek, Archer County, North Texas.
[00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:46.540]  We have to talk.
[00:01:47.853 --> 00:02:05.920]  State officials will be assisting to help identify potential alternative markets if a producer is unable to move animals and, if necessary, advise and assist on depopulation and disposal methods.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.623]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are plowing under vegetable crops from coast to coast.
[00:02:13.623 --> 00:02:16.224]  We are euthanizing millions of chickens.
[00:02:17.577 --> 00:02:24.842]  We are aborting sows and burying feeder pigs.
[00:02:24.842 --> 00:02:35.189]  We are dumping milk by the hundreds of thousands of gallons and now they are preparing us to depopulate the fat cattle
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.944]  Ready to harvest because of a bottleneck created by the effects of COVID.
[00:02:42.944 --> 00:02:50.488]  This thing hasn't been created by COVID, but the effects of COVID and the logistics therein.
[00:02:50.488 --> 00:03:02.155]  Yesterday, the first shipment of imported beef from the country of Namibia hit the shores of the United States of America.
[00:03:03.692 --> 00:03:11.556]  And yet this morning, they are telling us to prepare to euthanize harvest-ready cattle.
[00:03:11.556 --> 00:03:14.118]  It is time we get food on the shelves.
[00:03:14.118 --> 00:03:22.362]  Because if you're not concerned about this food supply problem, you better be.
[00:03:22.362 --> 00:03:28.065]  We have a huge supply and demand of food across this nation.
[00:03:28.065 --> 00:03:31.927]  We can feed the world ourselves, and yet we're destroying our harvests.
[00:03:34.372 --> 00:03:47.096]  At the same time, we are importing beef from other countries, beef that is less regulated than our beef, less safe, not as high quality of product, and yet it's happening.
[00:03:47.096 --> 00:03:53.979]  At the same time, they're preparing for us to euthanize our harvests.
[00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:57.523]  That doesn't sound like sustainability to me.
[00:03:57.523 --> 00:04:02.388]  But it is part of the overall goal to vertically integrate your food system.
[00:04:02.388 --> 00:04:08.473]  You see, they cannot have control of the people unless they have control of the food, the water, the land.
[00:04:08.473 --> 00:04:10.014]  Production.
[00:04:10.014 --> 00:04:11.796]  It is time we get back to work.
[00:04:11.796 --> 00:04:13.658]  We are of, by, and for the people.
[00:04:13.658 --> 00:04:15.779]  This is not Nancy Pelosi's country.
[00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:17.381]  This is not Donald Trump's country.
[00:04:17.381 --> 00:04:19.623]  This is your country.
[00:04:19.623 --> 00:04:20.644]  And you're gonna go hungry.
[00:04:21.434 --> 00:04:25.777]  And while American farmers are destroying their harvests, U.S.
[00:04:25.777 --> 00:04:29.479]  beef is exported to China.
[00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:29.780]  U.S.
[00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:37.365]  meat plants are closing at a rapid rate, including Cargill Meat, who supplies 22% of the U.S.
[00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:51.014]  meat market and who partnered with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2018 to end livestock production while expanding the production of genetically modified soy in Africa.
[00:04:52.679 --> 00:04:55.200]  Reporting for InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:05:12.253 --> 00:05:13.914]  That is amazing.
[00:05:13.914 --> 00:05:21.578]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[00:05:21.578 --> 00:05:23.899]  And there's another innovation.
[00:05:23.899 --> 00:05:25.980]  It's the spray cap.
[00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:31.403]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality.
[00:05:31.403 --> 00:05:33.584]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[00:05:33.584 --> 00:05:34.485]  I like to put it on my hands.
[00:05:35.225 --> 00:05:36.726]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[00:05:36.726 --> 00:05:39.569]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so don't spray it right in your eyes.
[00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:43.953]  But I just love it, personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[00:05:43.953 --> 00:05:45.734]  So, this is a real innovation.
[00:05:45.734 --> 00:05:52.120]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it so it doesn't dry you out.
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.641]  It smells great.
[00:05:53.641 --> 00:05:55.463]  It's so refreshing.
[00:05:55.463 --> 00:05:56.324]  This is a big winner.
[00:06:12.386 --> 00:06:12.966]  Welcome back.
[00:06:12.966 --> 00:06:19.649]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, on this live Tuesday, April 28th transmission that we're just now kicking off.
[00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:30.294]  The major farm bureaus around the country, the private ones, are coming out and pointing out that major so-called beef packing systems like Cargill
[00:06:32.495 --> 00:06:56.515]  Our partner with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to end beef and poultry and pork consumption, that they have a deal with Roundup Ready Sterilization Soybeans to force you to eat that.
[00:06:56.515 --> 00:06:58.237]  And these very same groups now
[00:06:59.881 --> 00:07:03.751]  ...are going around ordering that everybody kill their cows.
[00:07:03.751 --> 00:07:05.435]  We just played a special report.
[00:07:05.435 --> 00:07:06.578]  It's up on Band.Video.
[00:07:08.064 --> 00:07:21.734]  Saying that if your cows are ready to ship that the USDA is going to come around and oversee the killing of your cows as if cows can't live out on the farm or as if cows on the feedlot couldn't be sent back.
[00:07:21.734 --> 00:07:33.342]  We now know this is the bureaucracy, the big corporations, the authoritarian countries all ganged up corporately on America and permanently wrecking everything.
[00:07:33.342 --> 00:07:34.923]  This is economic warfare.
[00:07:34.923 --> 00:07:37.445]  It's just absolutely incredible.
[00:07:38.444 --> 00:07:44.510]  You know, a little birdie told me that one of the lead stories tonight on Tucker Carlson on Fox News is going to be this.
[00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:48.655]  It's up on Infowars.com with the video that's been banned.
[00:07:48.655 --> 00:07:50.196]  Save there.
[00:07:50.196 --> 00:07:56.543]  YouTube censors viral video of doctors criticizing stay-at-home order.
[00:07:57.915 --> 00:08:10.925]  He said it violates the terms of service, a press conference with two doctors that own a big string of clinics, and they're saying what all these other doctors are going public and saying that the death rate is less than 0.1%.
[00:08:15.114 --> 00:08:25.099]  And that we're seeing societal breakdown and a lot of people that are sick, unable to go to the hospital because they're closed for anything but COVID-19, basically.
[00:08:25.099 --> 00:08:28.260]  And it's confirmed that almost all the hospitals are empty.
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.501]  Just like listeners went out and videotaped in the last couple months.
[00:08:31.501 --> 00:08:35.363]  They're like, yeah, no, no, they're closed for COVID.
[00:08:35.363 --> 00:08:41.546]  And USA Today confirms instead of $4,000 for somebody that comes into the hospital in federal grant money,
[00:08:44.292 --> 00:08:51.394]  $40,000 for a COVID-19 patient so they're coding everyone as COVID-19 to again up that number.
[00:08:51.394 --> 00:08:56.876]  This has been a pre-planned medical tyranny takeover.
[00:08:56.876 --> 00:09:03.839]  Where the hospitals can lay off 80% of their employees but make bigger profits than they ever did and just gorge themselves
[00:09:04.993 --> 00:09:06.414]  On the taxpayer.
[00:09:06.414 --> 00:09:09.394]  And again, Trump's told, oh, sir, we're going to fund the hospitals.
[00:09:09.394 --> 00:09:12.616]  Oh, sir, we're going to, you know, fund these research.
[00:09:12.616 --> 00:09:14.496]  And really it's the opposite of that.
[00:09:14.496 --> 00:09:20.418]  It's a total giant scam, a bank robbery.
[00:09:20.418 --> 00:09:23.619]  So it's an incredible time to be alive right now.
[00:09:23.619 --> 00:09:25.980]  And we're all being taught how to have martial law.
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:28.481]  We're being taught how to live under total tyranny.
[00:09:28.481 --> 00:09:30.801]  We're being taught that we have no basic rights.
[00:09:30.801 --> 00:09:32.382]  This giant dystopia.
[00:09:34.170 --> 00:09:44.352]  Just warped out of hyperspaces, right here, right now, attacking everyone in this society.
[00:09:44.352 --> 00:09:55.414]  And I've been told, through high-level sources, that if you don't shut up, and you don't stop, we're gonna have you arrested, we're gonna have you indicted, or we'll have you killed.
[00:09:55.414 --> 00:09:59.375]  And so, they're doing that to me, I don't back down, I don't know how.
[00:10:00.678 --> 00:10:02.859]  It's not really a flight deal.
[00:10:02.859 --> 00:10:03.740]  I run by fighting.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.481]  The more you attack, the more I fight.
[00:10:05.481 --> 00:10:06.742]  Just call me stupid.
[00:10:06.742 --> 00:10:09.023]  It's what I do.
[00:10:09.023 --> 00:10:11.505]  But I think running has gotten America in this position.
[00:10:11.505 --> 00:10:15.327]  I think it's time to stop running, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:10:15.327 --> 00:10:20.351]  But let's air just four minutes of the hour and five-minute press conference that
[00:10:21.431 --> 00:10:22.331]  YouTube banned.
[00:10:22.331 --> 00:10:38.015]  They've banned Cedars-Sinai, one of the most prestigious hospitals, not just in the U.S., but around the world, putting out a video going, yeah, UV light really is, you know, killing the coronavirus and other things inside the lungs.
[00:10:38.015 --> 00:10:42.536]  Well, now it's not just YouTube and Twitter and Facebook censoring that video.
[00:10:42.536 --> 00:10:43.696]  Now they've all banned
[00:10:45.848 --> 00:10:49.229]  The viral video of doctors criticizing stay-at-home orders.
[00:10:49.229 --> 00:11:03.851]  So, this is the point that we've reached now where medical doctors cannot talk about facts and reality because they want you to believe if you leave your house you're going to die.
[00:11:03.851 --> 00:11:05.551]  The human civilization will end.
[00:11:05.551 --> 00:11:06.592]  Billions will starve to death.
[00:11:06.592 --> 00:11:12.753]  The UN now says 133 million are set to starve to death this year, not the 30 million.
[00:11:12.753 --> 00:11:14.453]  That was a UN release yesterday.
[00:11:15.836 --> 00:11:18.298]  So this is escalating quickly.
[00:11:18.298 --> 00:11:21.260]  And on the Owen Troyer War Room yesterday, they had a great graphic.
[00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:26.503]  I saw an InfoWars of a big giant Grim Reaper next to a baby Grim Reaper.
[00:11:26.503 --> 00:11:28.224]  And the baby Grim Reaper is COVID-19.
[00:11:28.224 --> 00:11:31.186]  He says, Hey, you haven't seen what poverty and starvation does.
[00:11:31.186 --> 00:11:32.307]  I'm the big daddy.
[00:11:32.307 --> 00:11:34.128]  That's the mission accomplished.
[00:11:34.128 --> 00:11:36.870]  That's been the globalist plan.
[00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:40.492]  So while we're losing our liberties and our future, the third world's losing their lives.
[00:11:40.492 --> 00:11:44.555]  So those that want to grandstand about, we're saving lives by doing this.
[00:11:44.555 --> 00:11:45.476]  No, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:11:46.946 --> 00:11:48.927]  This is all part of the Psychological Warfare Op.
[00:11:48.927 --> 00:11:51.288]  Here's the censored video of the doctors.
[00:11:51.288 --> 00:11:53.969]  It's a banned on video.
[00:11:53.969 --> 00:12:11.138]  After testing thousands of people in their county for COVID-19, doctors Dan Erickson and Artin Massini, owners of Accelerated Urgent Care in Bakersfield, California, held a press conference to share their data along with official CDC data.
[00:12:12.018 --> 00:12:21.201]  Dr. Erickson reported that hospitals in California have become empty as a result of allotting all resources to the COVID-19 pandemic.
[00:12:21.201 --> 00:12:31.865]  The hospitals, their ICUs are empty essentially and they're shutting down floors, they're furloughing patients, they're furloughing doctors because we just don't have the volume.
[00:12:31.865 --> 00:12:36.367]  So we're busy with paperwork for COVID and we're all focusing on COVID.
[00:12:36.747 --> 00:12:40.388]  He then went over the COVID-19 numbers for the state of California.
[00:12:40.388 --> 00:12:42.148]  We've seen 1,227 deaths in the state of California.
[00:12:42.148 --> 00:12:45.569]  That means you have a 0.03 chance of dying from COVID-19 in the state of California.
[00:12:45.569 --> 00:12:46.269]  And for the state of New York?
[00:12:46.269 --> 00:12:50.590]  19,410 out of 19 million people, which is a 0.1% chance of dying from COVID in the state of New York.
[00:13:00.652 --> 00:13:03.514]  And then compared these numbers to the seasonal flu in 2017.
[00:13:03.514 --> 00:13:06.536]  45 million total cases in 2017 with about 62,000 deaths or a 0.13 chance of death from flu in the United States.
[00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:07.797]  So the lethality of COVID-19 is much less.
[00:13:19.605 --> 00:13:27.192]  He then went on to report what is happening as a result of the shutdown and millions of hard-working people losing their jobs.
[00:13:27.192 --> 00:13:30.575]  Child molestation is increasing at a severe rate.
[00:13:30.575 --> 00:13:36.020]  We could go over multiple cases of children who have been molested due to angry,
[00:13:37.061 --> 00:13:41.022]  Family members who are intoxicated, who are home, who have no paycheck.
[00:13:41.022 --> 00:13:42.802]  These things last a lifetime.
[00:13:42.802 --> 00:13:44.823]  This isn't about a seasonal flu.
[00:13:44.823 --> 00:13:50.124]  These are things that will follow these people and affect them in a negative fashion for their life.
[00:13:50.124 --> 00:13:56.805]  And these are for me talking to ERs, talking to my doctors, and talking to people across the country and finding out what they're seeing.
[00:13:56.805 --> 00:14:00.846]  Spousal abuse, alcoholism, anxiety, depression, suicide.
[00:14:01.366 --> 00:14:12.663]  One of the most interesting moments of the press conference was when Dr. Erickson went on to explain the immune complex and how our immune system regularly adapts to our environment.
[00:14:12.663 --> 00:14:16.428]  The immune system is built by exposure to antigens, viruses, bacteria.
[00:14:17.029 --> 00:14:26.113]  When you're a little child crawling on the ground, putting stuff in your mouth, viruses and bacteria come in, you form an antigen-antibody complex, you form IgG, IgM.
[00:14:26.113 --> 00:14:27.814]  This is how your immune system is built.
[00:14:27.814 --> 00:14:35.797]  When you take human beings and you say, go into your house, clean all your counters, lice all them down, you're going to kill 99% of viruses and bacteria.
[00:14:35.797 --> 00:14:37.618]  Wear a mask, don't go outside.
[00:14:37.618 --> 00:14:39.499]  What does that do to our immune system?
[00:14:39.499 --> 00:14:41.100]  Our immune system is used to touching.
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:46.403]  We share bacteria, staphylococcal, streptococcal bacteria, viruses.
[00:14:46.403 --> 00:14:49.246]  We develop an immune response daily to this stuff.
[00:14:49.246 --> 00:14:53.209]  When you take that away from me, my immune system drops.
[00:14:53.209 --> 00:14:56.311]  As I shelter in place, my immune system drops.
[00:14:56.311 --> 00:14:58.493]  You keep me there for months, it drops more.
[00:14:58.493 --> 00:15:00.894]  Sheltering in place decreases your immune system.
[00:15:00.894 --> 00:15:06.519]  And then as we all come out of shelter in place with a lower immune system and start trading viruses and bacteria, what do you think is going to happen?
[00:15:07.299 --> 00:15:14.344]  Disease is going to spike and then you've got disease spike amongst the hospital system with furloughed doctors and nurses.
[00:15:14.344 --> 00:15:21.569]  Dr. Erickson reported that he has been in contact with leading physicians throughout California and that they are all in agreement.
[00:15:21.569 --> 00:15:26.633]  And I've been working with some of the leaders and I've talked to, you know, the head of the CDPH.
[00:15:26.633 --> 00:15:31.977]  I've gotten their opinion on this and a lot of the leaders in Sacramento and we're all in agreement.
[00:15:32.817 --> 00:15:40.951]  But we need to have Governor Newsom in agreement with us to lift this ban because the data is showing us it's time to lift.
[00:15:40.951 --> 00:15:43.896]  So if we don't lift, what is the reason?
[00:15:43.896 --> 00:15:45.919]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:15:57.933 --> 00:15:59.194]  Maybe not today.
[00:15:59.194 --> 00:16:00.475]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[00:16:00.475 --> 00:16:04.218]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[00:16:04.218 --> 00:16:05.299]  Forget bunkers.
[00:16:05.299 --> 00:16:07.121]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[00:16:07.121 --> 00:16:08.842]  You need Survivalist Camps.
[00:16:08.842 --> 00:16:16.629]  The ultimate, fully functional, off-the-grid, mobile survival bug-out house that's well-equipped and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[00:16:16.629 --> 00:16:17.649]  Bold statement?
[00:16:17.649 --> 00:16:18.650]  You bet.
[00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:21.132]  See them now at survivalistcamps.com.
[00:16:21.132 --> 00:16:23.334]  That's survivalistcamps.com.

[00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:30.972]  This is a Corona crisis self-reliance alert.
[00:16:30.972 --> 00:16:39.499]  If you're worried about the power grid in the current crisis and want to generate your own supply of off-the-grid electrical power just in case, pay close attention.
[00:16:39.499 --> 00:16:40.520]  Here's why.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:45.024]  A limited supply of solar backup generators will be available again in the next two weeks.
[00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:51.412]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical backup power when you get off the grid.
[00:16:51.412 --> 00:17:00.685]  And unlike gas generators, these solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[00:17:00.685 --> 00:17:02.488]  Dangerous weather, social unrest,
[00:17:02.808 --> 00:17:10.634]  Or overloaded grids this summer will not be a problem if you go to my solar backup dot com and get your solar backup generator.
[00:17:10.634 --> 00:17:15.899]  We regret that supplies are limited and only available on a first come first serve basis.
[00:17:15.899 --> 00:17:18.801]  Check availability at my solar backup dot com.
[00:17:18.801 --> 00:17:21.443]  Never suffer painful power outages again.
[00:17:21.443 --> 00:17:23.705]  Go to my solar backup dot com.
[00:17:23.705 --> 00:17:25.767]  That's my solar backup dot com.
[00:17:27.048 --> 00:17:28.950]  Fully cooked, ready to eat bacon.
[00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:32.172]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center cut, presidential bacon.
[00:17:32.172 --> 00:17:33.773]  Savory and delicious.
[00:17:33.773 --> 00:17:36.616]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[00:17:36.616 --> 00:17:37.276]  Awesome.
[00:17:37.276 --> 00:17:40.359]  No refrigeration needed with a 10 year shelf life.
[00:17:40.359 --> 00:17:41.940]  NASA PAC technology.
[00:17:41.940 --> 00:17:42.561]  Bacon.
[00:17:42.561 --> 00:17:46.704]  Fully cooked, fully hydrated, ready to eat right from the pack bacon.
[00:17:46.704 --> 00:17:48.145]  Or warm and served.
[00:17:48.145 --> 00:17:50.187]  Life saving, ready to eat bacon.
[00:17:50.187 --> 00:17:52.148]  10 year shelf life bacon.
[00:17:52.148 --> 00:17:54.910]  Ships free at Fully Cooked Bacon dot com.
[00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.532]  Fully Cooked Bacon dot com.
[00:17:58.621 --> 00:18:04.067]  Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars can now offer high-quality, storable food again.
[00:18:04.067 --> 00:18:09.592]  Other manufacturers were sold out eight weeks ago, and they told people they had food.
[00:18:09.592 --> 00:18:11.394]  Most folks never delivered their food.
[00:18:11.394 --> 00:18:20.604]  Well, when our sponsors' food began to run short, they just didn't sell, so they opened more factories and secured more food.
[00:18:21.064 --> 00:18:23.185]  So get your orders in right now.
[00:18:23.185 --> 00:18:26.246]  They can take new orders and get it to you quickly.
[00:18:26.246 --> 00:18:34.809]  You'll probably have to suspend orders very, very soon again because the lockdown of the economy is killing food distribution, farming, you name it.
[00:18:34.809 --> 00:18:36.170]  And now it's mainstream news.
[00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:39.451]  The food shortages and delivery are already starting to happen.
[00:18:40.211 --> 00:18:45.414]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[00:19:09.096 --> 00:19:13.839]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[00:19:13.839 --> 00:19:16.180]  Super Male Vitality!
[00:19:16.180 --> 00:19:25.045]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[00:19:25.045 --> 00:19:35.912]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[00:19:36.192 --> 00:19:36.872]  Yes.
[00:19:36.872 --> 00:19:41.775]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[00:19:41.775 --> 00:19:48.598]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[00:19:48.598 --> 00:19:49.759]  So what are you waiting for?
[00:19:49.759 --> 00:19:51.620]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.421]  Never been a better time than right now.
[00:19:54.421 --> 00:20:01.225]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:20:01.225 --> 00:20:03.886]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:24.634]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:20:24.634 --> 00:20:26.436]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:26.436 --> 00:20:31.880]  Alright, let me just do this.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:40.288]  Let me give the number up because I really want to have more calls on the show and I want to get it up front and I want to take calls within the first hour most days at least.
[00:20:40.288 --> 00:20:40.488]  But...
[00:20:42.342 --> 00:20:45.304]  I tend to not get to a lot of news these days because there's just so much.
[00:20:45.304 --> 00:20:46.205]  It's so insane.
[00:20:46.205 --> 00:20:51.629]  Like, you can't do justice to each piece of this.
[00:20:51.629 --> 00:20:52.869]  And so why even get to it?
[00:20:52.869 --> 00:21:00.815]  In fact, I've got hundreds of news stories and dozens of incredible video clips, but I never got to this article yesterday.
[00:21:05.677 --> 00:21:07.858]  And then I was up here this morning at 7 a.m.
[00:21:07.858 --> 00:21:14.459]  working, and I had David Knight on in the conference room when I was taking breaks.
[00:21:14.459 --> 00:21:19.020]  And he was reading this article on air out of MSN.
[00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:22.081]  There's another one out of the Atlantic.
[00:21:22.081 --> 00:21:23.802]  It's originally out of the Atlantic.
[00:21:23.802 --> 00:21:25.522]  Jack Goldsmith.
[00:21:25.522 --> 00:21:29.003]  And it says, Internet speech will never go back to normal.
[00:21:30.236 --> 00:21:35.797]  And it endorses communist China and says that big tech is now emboldened by all the censorship.
[00:21:35.797 --> 00:21:40.578]  And there's a bunch of these articles praising it.
[00:21:40.578 --> 00:21:41.418]  And what are they blocking?
[00:21:41.418 --> 00:21:44.599]  They're blocking the president's tweets.
[00:21:44.599 --> 00:21:51.000]  They're blocking Joe Biden rape victims on Larry King Live.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.822]  They're involved in total informational control, like something out of a science fiction horror movie.
[00:21:57.822 --> 00:21:58.882]  Here's one of the things they censored.
[00:22:01.175 --> 00:22:06.438]  YouTube censors video about UV light treatment against coronavirus.
[00:22:06.438 --> 00:22:07.339]  NewsWorks.com.
[00:22:07.339 --> 00:22:07.999]  We have an archive.
[00:22:07.999 --> 00:22:14.804]  We have our own system, Banned.Video, to do that, which, of course, Banned.Video is exploding.
[00:22:14.804 --> 00:22:17.326]  People asked me two years ago, you've been totally banned.
[00:22:17.326 --> 00:22:18.066]  How are you taking it?
[00:22:18.066 --> 00:22:20.388]  I said, you're all going to be banned.
[00:22:20.388 --> 00:22:23.690]  And I'm going to have a platform that's not banned until they come arrest me.
[00:22:24.633 --> 00:22:26.435]  But that's how this works in progression.
[00:22:26.435 --> 00:22:30.460]  You don't care that somebody's losing their rights because you think it's only you.
[00:22:30.460 --> 00:22:31.662]  You're actually the target.
[00:22:31.662 --> 00:22:34.805]  Then once you learn you lose your rights, you go to the alternative.
[00:22:34.805 --> 00:22:41.674]  The alternative explodes so big it either defeats the original tyrant or it gets overwhelmed and defeated.
[00:22:42.881 --> 00:22:44.582]  See, I'm thinking big picture.
[00:22:44.582 --> 00:22:47.123]  And people are always like, Jones is so weird.
[00:22:47.123 --> 00:22:50.705]  How does he advise the president and intelligence agencies and all these groups?
[00:22:50.705 --> 00:22:55.247]  Because I don't muddy my thoughts with what's going to affect me.
[00:22:55.247 --> 00:22:56.907]  I cut myself out of the picture.
[00:22:56.907 --> 00:22:59.288]  I just automatically have always done it.
[00:22:59.288 --> 00:23:01.189]  I'm not thinking about what advances Alex Jones.
[00:23:01.189 --> 00:23:04.491]  I am a total collectivist.
[00:23:05.509 --> 00:23:07.050]  Because I'm a total individualist.
[00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:12.054]  I believe in the individual, but I believe individuals must come together in the collective to defeat evil.
[00:23:12.054 --> 00:23:13.555]  That's our only hope.
[00:23:13.555 --> 00:23:16.217]  I will lose my life in my future if the globalists win.
[00:23:16.217 --> 00:23:17.698]  We all will.
[00:23:17.698 --> 00:23:22.141]  So I don't want to be powerful as the ship goes down and be wearing a captain's hat in a sinking ship.
[00:23:22.141 --> 00:23:23.882]  I want the ship to float.
[00:23:23.882 --> 00:23:30.988]  That means if I've got to die in the process of the ship staying afloat so my children make it, that's a default normal position.
[00:23:30.988 --> 00:23:32.709]  I'm not a sick freak, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:23:34.428 --> 00:23:42.430]  But I do envy the psychosis-filled globalists and people who just think it's all funny, and who don't care, and are living in the moment.
[00:23:42.430 --> 00:23:45.910]  Because I wish I was a little bit like them, so I wasn't tortured.
[00:23:45.910 --> 00:23:48.371]  Because I am tortured by what's happening.
[00:23:48.371 --> 00:23:49.671]  I know you are as well.
[00:23:49.671 --> 00:23:50.711]  Because you're supposed to!
[00:23:50.711 --> 00:23:52.332]  You've got feelings!
[00:23:52.332 --> 00:23:54.752]  Which means you've got nerve endings.
[00:23:54.752 --> 00:23:57.053]  You're connected to things.
[00:23:57.053 --> 00:24:03.354]  And you pick these... And so you want to override the evil.
[00:24:03.354 --> 00:24:03.994]  You're called...
[00:24:08.496 --> 00:24:12.858]  You're what makes the whole thing go round, and I salute you.
[00:24:12.858 --> 00:24:28.027]  But this article, there's a bunch of them like this, sound like they're defending speech, and you read deeper, it's like, oh, but China, they know what to do, and we need to be more like them, you see, because out-of-control speech can cause lives, you know?
[00:24:28.027 --> 00:24:32.909]  We needed a never-ending lockdown, and no alternative treatments, and we're all dead.
[00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:37.512]  Even though every model they gave us was fake, everything was globalist-type, Chai Com Run,
[00:24:39.793 --> 00:24:41.414]  Here's another one.
[00:24:41.414 --> 00:24:46.538]  YouTube censors video about UV light treatment used against coronavirus from Cedars-Sinai.
[00:24:46.538 --> 00:24:50.420]  And then YouTube censored 5 million views on YouTube alone, one version.
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:52.502]  They censored a bunch of other versions, over 20 million views.
[00:24:52.502 --> 00:24:54.043]  I checked this morning.
[00:24:54.043 --> 00:24:57.025]  Censors viral video of doctors criticizing stay-at-home order.
[00:24:57.025 --> 00:24:57.525]  Well, guess what?
[00:24:57.525 --> 00:24:59.487]  Band-Aid videos got a half million views on that.
[00:25:00.558 --> 00:25:01.359]  With no sponsors.
[00:25:01.359 --> 00:25:02.680]  We're just paying for the bandwidth.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:12.489]  Because there is a distinct pleasure in the fact that they're taking this down on Facebook, Twitter, Google, and its subsidiaries, YouTube.
[00:25:12.489 --> 00:25:24.780]  And they are so desperately pissed that we are still on air despite that because, you see, that's not supposed to be there.
[00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:30.023]  You're not supposed to hear a press conference from people that own, like, 20-something clinics.
[00:25:30.023 --> 00:25:34.246]  You're not supposed to hear them talk about the governor's office admitting to them it's all a hoax.
[00:25:34.246 --> 00:25:36.727]  Because that'll end their world right there, folks.
[00:25:36.727 --> 00:25:48.795]  They're planning to take down America, start a third world, throw out the American recovery, because there's still good professionals in every level of academia, law enforcement, medicine, banking, agriculture.
[00:25:48.795 --> 00:25:52.397]  There's still good people, black, white, old, young, everywhere.
[00:25:52.397 --> 00:25:54.999]  And they can't let one of us stand up and get attention
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:03.847]  Because then we might all stand up, and then that ends their little world, doesn't it?
[00:26:03.847 --> 00:26:06.989]  But I've got all the new news I haven't hit, and we'll cover it when we come back.
[00:26:06.989 --> 00:26:07.970]  And I'll give the number out.
[00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:08.350]  It's 877-789-2539.
[00:26:08.350 --> 00:26:08.611]  877-789-Alex.
[00:26:08.611 --> 00:26:08.711]  877-789-2539.
[00:26:08.711 --> 00:26:15.036]  There is a giant third column, fourth column, fifth column, whatever you want to call it, beside the federal government run by the Communist Chinese.
[00:26:24.759 --> 00:26:27.003]  And it's come out that most media is funded by them.
[00:26:27.003 --> 00:26:28.365]  Hell, they bought up most of Hollywood.
[00:26:29.429 --> 00:26:33.991]  Uh, and they're, they're scared that we're rolling up their Chinese operatives and their networks.
[00:26:33.991 --> 00:26:42.014]  That's why they tried to, well they didn't try, they, that's why they set up Roger Stone and General Flynn and they've been up and down me and not been able to find anything they can even cook up.
[00:26:42.014 --> 00:26:47.517]  But they're, they're, they're, they're past that point now and are, and are, and are really cracking the whip.
[00:26:47.517 --> 00:26:54.980]  But, but, but I see that as a sign of their desperation that they are working around the clock trying to put yours truly in jail.
[00:26:55.913 --> 00:27:00.176]  Because they're criminals, and I didn't get into this expecting to not be killed, quite frankly.
[00:27:00.176 --> 00:27:01.177]  Now, that doesn't mean I want it to happen.
[00:27:01.177 --> 00:27:02.437]  That doesn't mean I'm looking forward to it.
[00:27:02.437 --> 00:27:05.960]  That doesn't mean I'm looking forward to being thrown in a prison cell.
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.380]  But I got an idea.
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:08.842]  We're going to take the country back, and you guys are going to let me out.
[00:27:08.842 --> 00:27:09.983]  I'm betting on you.
[00:27:10.976 --> 00:27:12.376]  And you're incredible.
[00:27:12.376 --> 00:27:13.957]  Those of you that are awake are amazing.
[00:27:13.957 --> 00:27:21.299]  I still am sad that more people aren't awake and energized because the sides are so clear-cut here, folks.
[00:27:21.299 --> 00:27:22.659]  We're the good guys.
[00:27:22.659 --> 00:27:23.479]  And everybody knows it.
[00:27:23.479 --> 00:27:26.780]  I mean, the enemy can barely even talk or operate.
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:27.800]  You can't shut me up.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.641]  You can't shut you up.
[00:27:29.641 --> 00:27:33.561]  Our track record is just solid platinum because we're real, folks.
[00:27:33.561 --> 00:27:34.602]  I mean, we're the real deal.
[00:27:36.877 --> 00:27:42.542]  You're the real deal, and that's why your prayers are paramount.
[00:27:42.542 --> 00:27:46.325]  And then you're spreading the word is penultimate.
[00:27:46.325 --> 00:27:49.448]  And then you've got the trifecta there, but beneath that is the financial support.
[00:27:49.448 --> 00:27:53.371]  But you pray, number one.
[00:27:53.371 --> 00:27:55.032]  You spread the word, that's number two.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:59.322]  And then that little added magic is the money.
[00:27:59.322 --> 00:28:02.484]  And I never even wanted money until they tried to shut me down 15 years ago.
[00:28:02.484 --> 00:28:06.267]  And I literally, God said to me, I'm not kidding, like, you need to stop being a shame.
[00:28:06.267 --> 00:28:08.988]  You need to build an operation that's huge.
[00:28:08.988 --> 00:28:10.709]  You need to fight them on every front.
[00:28:10.709 --> 00:28:11.950]  And you need to be prosperous.
[00:28:11.950 --> 00:28:12.931]  And you need to do that.
[00:28:12.931 --> 00:28:13.691]  And I did it.
[00:28:13.691 --> 00:28:14.492]  And you did it.
[00:28:14.492 --> 00:28:15.332]  And here we are today.
[00:28:15.332 --> 00:28:18.995]  And so now, when you buy a product at Inforrestore.com, you're not just getting a great product.
[00:28:19.873 --> 00:28:25.518]  You are putting money into the Second American Revolution worldwide, and you've seen it pay off like no other dividend.
[00:28:25.518 --> 00:28:26.919]  You've seen the victory.
[00:28:26.919 --> 00:28:27.680]  It's your victory.
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:28.661]  You did this.
[00:28:28.661 --> 00:28:29.802]  That's all you call thanking me.
[00:28:30.990 --> 00:28:32.850]  Thanking me, that's a sick joke.
[00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:36.691]  Thank yourself and thank God for giving you the common sense you've got.
[00:28:36.691 --> 00:28:40.212]  God gave you the sense to find your ass, just like he gave me it.
[00:28:40.212 --> 00:28:44.153]  And thank God you're not like these lepers who don't rejoice and laugh at them, how pathetic they are.
[00:28:44.153 --> 00:28:46.673]  That, they could have, that could be us, okay?
[00:28:46.673 --> 00:28:48.354]  That's dangerous, that's cancer right there.
[00:28:48.354 --> 00:28:51.694]  We ought to mourn what our fellow humans have turned into.
[00:28:51.694 --> 00:28:54.075]  And then warn those that still haven't succumbed to Satan.
[00:28:54.075 --> 00:28:54.535]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:57.625 --> 00:28:59.486]  Hand sanitizer is not an option.
[00:28:59.486 --> 00:29:00.687]  It's now a must have.
[00:29:00.687 --> 00:29:01.948]  But where can you find it?

[00:30:44.426 --> 00:30:45.026]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139.

[00:30:46.467 --> 00:30:47.267]  That's InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:58.934 --> 00:31:13.250]  Hiding in plain view, Politico, the Associated Press, you name it, admit that a half a billion people, extra 500 million, are now at the subsistence starvation level, on top of all the millions already starving because of the global lockdown.
[00:31:13.831 --> 00:31:30.674]  That is hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19, and the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the CHICOMS at the World Health Organization, with Bill Gates involved, are now the ones running the operation to shut down society, create a depression, and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[00:31:30.794 --> 00:31:31.834]  This is insane.
[00:31:31.834 --> 00:31:34.535]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[00:31:34.535 --> 00:31:35.976]  You need to get prepared now.
[00:31:35.976 --> 00:31:40.517]  You need to get high-quality, storable food now back in stock at InfowarStore.com.
[00:31:40.517 --> 00:31:44.598]  And you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[00:31:44.598 --> 00:31:50.881]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing.
[00:31:50.881 --> 00:31:52.861]  This is beyond 1984.
[00:31:52.861 --> 00:31:54.462]  The tyranny of the dual order is here.
[00:31:54.462 --> 00:31:56.882]  Get prepared now and spread the word in the Infowar.
[00:31:56.882 --> 00:31:58.283]  You are the Paul Reveres!
[00:31:59.198 --> 00:32:06.522]  I'm not going to sit here and waste your time or my time and rattle off the successes and full words of that.
[00:32:06.522 --> 00:32:09.803]  If you're paying attention, you know we've done together.
[00:32:09.803 --> 00:32:10.564]  But I'll tell you this.
[00:32:12.099 --> 00:32:19.782]  The technocrats are really upping their game and they are trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[00:32:19.782 --> 00:32:22.163]  They're trying to shudder and silence human resistance.
[00:32:22.163 --> 00:32:27.805]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[00:32:27.805 --> 00:32:30.926]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is going to be true.
[00:32:30.926 --> 00:32:33.707]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[00:32:33.707 --> 00:32:37.048]  The power structure should have silenced those of us that they can't.
[00:32:38.088 --> 00:32:42.689]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[00:32:42.689 --> 00:32:44.409]  We have the power.
[00:32:44.409 --> 00:32:48.730]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[00:32:48.730 --> 00:32:54.311]  We have to make sure that we fight hard right now to make sure that long dark night doesn't come.
[00:32:54.311 --> 00:33:02.232]  So be the Polar Bears you are.
[00:33:02.232 --> 00:33:04.853]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:33:17.856 --> 00:33:19.978]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33:19.978 --> 00:33:39.774]  All right, let me hit a couple of big stories here that just illustrate why they don't want Zero Hedge out there, why they don't want M4s out there, why they don't want Summit.News, Paul Watson, host of the 4th Hour today, why they didn't like things like Drudge, because that can control the narrative, and they don't.
[00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:43.812]  Here's an article out of National Review.
[00:33:43.812 --> 00:33:58.545]  We told you two years ago that the FBI set up General Flynn and put out fake 302s and then did a fake plea deal because Flynn thought he could trust and hire Democrat lawyers.
[00:33:58.545 --> 00:34:05.712]  And this broke last week in the mainstream news, but finally it's in National Review.
[00:34:05.712 --> 00:34:08.054]  How they set up Flynn, how he did absolutely nothing wrong.
[00:34:09.443 --> 00:34:12.907]  But he advised the president on how to make America great again and who the spies were.
[00:34:12.907 --> 00:34:16.331]  So they had to destroy him to teach others a lesson.
[00:34:16.331 --> 00:34:25.001]  You give the president real advice, that's the ultimate crime in America right now.
[00:34:25.001 --> 00:34:26.222]  Here's another one.
[00:34:26.222 --> 00:34:27.644]  And I'd like to say we broke this first.
[00:34:30.285 --> 00:34:35.867]  Stuff like Information Liberation, Zero Hedge, had it like a day before us, but we popularized it.
[00:34:35.867 --> 00:34:40.088]  I think, speak of the devil, Drudge linked to us, but look at this.
[00:34:40.088 --> 00:34:40.488]  U.S.
[00:34:40.488 --> 00:34:50.310]  intel officials, this is the Washington Post, believe 45,500 corpses were incinerated in one fortnight in Wuhan.
[00:34:50.310 --> 00:34:59.353]  And this is the most incredible article where it talks about millions dying a month in China already just of
[00:35:00.506 --> 00:35:02.789]  Did you hear what I just said of respiratory illnesses?
[00:35:02.789 --> 00:35:03.910]  It's so toxic.
[00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:10.918]  And so how they can hire, how they can hide hundreds of thousands of deaths within that.
[00:35:10.918 --> 00:35:15.122]  Because you hear like, oh my God, 40,000 Americans have died of COVID-19.
[00:35:15.122 --> 00:35:19.807]  It's like, oh my gosh, that's the worst thing since, the flu kills that every year.
[00:35:19.807 --> 00:35:21.670]  But this article is incredible because remember,
[00:35:22.734 --> 00:35:26.897]  It was literally the independent media that broke this first.
[00:35:26.897 --> 00:35:32.281]  An independent media that went to publicly available satellite feeds and went, look at these maps.
[00:35:32.281 --> 00:35:35.484]  That's where they've got trash incinerators.
[00:35:35.484 --> 00:35:40.688]  And that's where they and normal trash doesn't release this much sulfur.
[00:35:40.688 --> 00:35:41.989]  And so they had equations.
[00:35:43.348 --> 00:35:46.871]  And found it was humans and US Intel goes, yeah, no, it's humans.
[00:35:46.871 --> 00:35:49.213]  Thousands a day at one site being burned.
[00:35:49.213 --> 00:35:50.534]  That's human intelligence.
[00:35:50.534 --> 00:35:51.774]  That's human.
[00:35:51.774 --> 00:35:53.816]  Machines can't do that.
[00:35:53.816 --> 00:35:55.898]  We have to read what machines say and do.
[00:35:55.898 --> 00:35:57.459]  So there's zero hedge.
[00:35:57.459 --> 00:36:02.483]  March 29th, more evidence China's lying number of earns more than double reported coronavirus test.
[00:36:02.483 --> 00:36:04.044]  Yeah, that's March 29th.
[00:36:04.044 --> 00:36:05.705]  That's a fine thing for you guys to find a month ago.
[00:36:05.705 --> 00:36:06.386]  It was before that.
[00:36:07.179 --> 00:36:17.342]  I mean, there were articles before that, but my point is, is that, oh, the Washington Post is all over the Urns and the satellite images.
[00:36:17.342 --> 00:36:22.804]  And it all broke right here in early March.
[00:36:22.804 --> 00:36:27.546]  And the crew just searched what I said while I was talking about it and found something a month ago, but it goes back even further.
[00:36:27.546 --> 00:36:31.807]  Again, that's why they don't want us on air.
[00:36:31.807 --> 00:36:32.067]  Because
[00:36:35.421 --> 00:36:39.904]  Humans are, you the viewers, you the activists, you the gladiators in the arena.
[00:36:39.904 --> 00:36:42.306]  You're not, you're not viewers.
[00:36:42.306 --> 00:36:43.327]  You're not spectators.
[00:36:43.327 --> 00:36:44.067]  You're not listeners.
[00:36:44.067 --> 00:36:46.049]  You're gladiators for humanity.
[00:36:46.049 --> 00:36:48.110]  You're pro-human.
[00:36:48.110 --> 00:36:50.232]  And I'm seeing that everywhere now on Twitter.
[00:36:50.232 --> 00:36:50.972]  I'm pro-human.
[00:36:50.972 --> 00:36:52.774]  We're the pro-human resistance.
[00:36:52.774 --> 00:36:54.215]  People now get it, man.
[00:36:54.215 --> 00:36:56.236]  We need a human lobby.
[00:36:56.236 --> 00:36:57.917]  A human movement.
[00:36:57.917 --> 00:36:59.979]  A, a, a, a, a human
[00:37:02.916 --> 00:37:04.757]  System.
[00:37:04.757 --> 00:37:11.401]  Just like they have with how workers supposedly, you know, a hundred years ago, used to organize into the unions.
[00:37:11.401 --> 00:37:17.125]  But just on the packaging, I want to see humans designed it, humans made it, humans packaged it.
[00:37:17.125 --> 00:37:17.345]  Sure.
[00:37:17.345 --> 00:37:17.625]  Okay.
[00:37:17.625 --> 00:37:18.465]  You got your machine.
[00:37:18.465 --> 00:37:19.106]  Great.
[00:37:19.106 --> 00:37:21.287]  I make my decision to want a pro-human future.
[00:37:21.287 --> 00:37:25.910]  You tell me it's the innovation that I'm shoveled my grave and I'm over and I'm done and I'm obsolete.
[00:37:25.910 --> 00:37:27.491]  You know, screw you.
[00:37:27.491 --> 00:37:30.293]  I can still use my purchasing power that I only have for a little bit longer.
[00:37:31.013 --> 00:37:33.875]  Just say no to your system, and that's why they're doing the lockdown.
[00:37:33.875 --> 00:37:35.575]  It's why they're doing the shutdown.
[00:37:35.575 --> 00:37:48.502]  They're teaching you that you're obsolete, that you're not essential, to try to get you to accept that, so that the drones and the robots have to police you and control you, because we're obsolete, because we might die.
[00:37:48.502 --> 00:37:50.983]  Think about that satanic statement.
[00:37:50.983 --> 00:37:52.464]  The mathematics of that.
[00:37:52.464 --> 00:37:53.805]  It's like saying 2 plus 2 equals 0.
[00:37:55.816 --> 00:38:00.728]  Humans are obsolete and die easily from viruses and bacteria, which isn't even true.
[00:38:00.728 --> 00:38:04.096]  So we have to make you obsolete so that we can save you.
[00:38:05.782 --> 00:38:14.868]  No, they're cutting your arms and legs off, they're tying you up, they're disabling you, so they can have their big AI takeover.
[00:38:14.868 --> 00:38:16.469]  Because it wasn't working!
[00:38:16.469 --> 00:38:28.476]  The big plan they promised by 2020 would be launched, and 2030 to be complete, and Ray Kurzweil, and they're all gonna be gods, and the big tech AI kings robbing us, and raping us, and spying on us, and all this.
[00:38:28.476 --> 00:38:30.657]  And now they're in the news going, you have no freedom!
[00:38:30.657 --> 00:38:32.018]  Damn right we're watching you!
[00:38:32.018 --> 00:38:33.239]  Damn right we're censoring you!
[00:38:33.519 --> 00:38:35.141]  You're a medical doctor?
[00:38:35.141 --> 00:38:37.783]  You come out and say that people who live in bubbles are sick?
[00:38:37.783 --> 00:38:40.346]  We'll just ban you!
[00:38:40.346 --> 00:38:43.949]  And once we can silence you, we can kill your ass.
[00:38:43.949 --> 00:38:48.233]  Well, there's more than one way to skin a cat.
[00:38:48.233 --> 00:38:53.639]  I don't want to go to that level yet unless we can't turn this around, but if you have nothing left to lose...
[00:38:55.396 --> 00:39:03.264]  One human could go out and take out 15 5G towers and surveillance grids before you get killed by the drones.
[00:39:03.264 --> 00:39:05.066]  Even if they have a drone on every block.
[00:39:05.066 --> 00:39:10.371]  And once other humans see other humans do something, stampedes don't just go in the direction of slavery.
[00:39:10.371 --> 00:39:19.180]  Stampedes go... Instead of like running around cowering and pissing on ourselves, everybody gets fired up and gets their weapons and then we're unstoppable.
[00:39:22.591 --> 00:39:25.013]  And I'm telling the New World Order, that's all you're summoning.
[00:39:25.013 --> 00:39:27.554]  Oh, I can feel it.
[00:39:27.554 --> 00:39:29.275]  And technology's not a bad thing.
[00:39:29.275 --> 00:39:30.957]  Like, fire's not a bad thing.
[00:39:30.957 --> 00:39:33.398]  Fire to light your hearth and cook some food.
[00:39:33.398 --> 00:39:34.319]  Fire to look at.
[00:39:34.319 --> 00:39:38.241]  Fire to... What, do you want to put me on that fire?
[00:39:38.241 --> 00:39:39.983]  You think I'm on the spit?
[00:39:39.983 --> 00:39:40.683]  I got an idea.
[00:39:40.683 --> 00:39:43.725]  I'm gonna use that fire on your ass.
[00:39:43.725 --> 00:39:46.587]  You want to take my guns and tell me I'm a slave?
[00:39:46.587 --> 00:39:48.428]  I'll use a knife and take your guns.
[00:39:48.428 --> 00:39:50.550]  And I'll burn your ass down.
[00:39:50.550 --> 00:39:52.111]  I'll burn your house down.
[00:39:53.183 --> 00:39:54.784]  You wanna burn, baby, burn?
[00:39:54.784 --> 00:40:00.148]  These damn robots are gonna burn!
[00:40:00.148 --> 00:40:08.614]  Now, we're not at that point yet, but I want you to intergenerationally understand the power you have as a weapon.
[00:40:08.614 --> 00:40:19.482]  You got power to take care of your babies and grow crops and be a good person.
[00:40:19.482 --> 00:40:22.203]  But you've got the sacred right to defend yourself and to kill.
[00:40:23.117 --> 00:40:24.618]  Or other people are trying to kill your ass.
[00:40:24.618 --> 00:40:26.720]  You understand that?
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:28.502]  You understand me?
[00:40:28.502 --> 00:40:39.612]  You need to find your spirit and stop giving in to these devil worshippers while they're trying to enslave you and your family and take everything you've got and everything you ever are and destroy your children!
[00:40:39.612 --> 00:40:46.197]  And you need to let them know that you will defeat them one way or another!
[00:40:46.197 --> 00:40:49.961]  And it's that spirit that's gonna prevail.
[00:40:50.998 --> 00:41:17.311]  But you gotta find that spirit and just have it there and know that it's something that's gonna empower you to work hard and be good and not get in a fight with your wife or your husband and to change those diapers and to carry out the trash and to trim the trees and to work hard because that makes you strong and to save money and to take care of yourself and to have a good life and be happy because you know these technocrats are up there trying to screw you over but just by you making it a human future and just by you living a good life
[00:41:19.232 --> 00:41:21.373]  As the French say, the best revenge is living well.
[00:41:21.373 --> 00:41:23.333]  You're kicking their ass.
[00:41:23.333 --> 00:41:40.337]  These blue blood scumbags that are so unhappy, they project their hatred of themselves onto us, and we reject their hate, and we reject their death, and we reject their Hitler garbage, and their leftist trash, and we just say, we're not part of you.
[00:41:40.337 --> 00:41:41.918]  But if you ever get us down,
[00:41:43.581 --> 00:41:45.742]  You think you got me chained up?
[00:41:45.742 --> 00:41:48.484]  I'll chew my arms off and bite your neck off.
[00:41:48.484 --> 00:41:49.964]  Metaphysically.
[00:41:49.964 --> 00:41:53.146]  They cannot chain this spirit, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:41:53.146 --> 00:42:12.837]  And they will never chain it because they know it's better than them and that's why they spend all their time trying to chain down people that are strong, who they know they can't deal with because they're scared of competition instead of embracing the competition that makes us all great as our species comes together and moves into the next level.
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:19.084]  So I said I'd take your calls and I said I'd cover the news and I'll try to hit it all as best I can.
[00:42:19.084 --> 00:42:29.032]  Just remember, every day we're still on air is a miracle because of your prayers, your support, and realize that every day that their plan unfolds and the evil is more manifest.
[00:42:31.024 --> 00:42:32.004]  Makes us stronger.
[00:42:32.004 --> 00:42:34.525]  We don't want that to happen, but now everything we said is coming true.
[00:42:34.525 --> 00:42:38.947]  Well, they can't let that light, as the dark of the night comes, stay there.
[00:42:38.947 --> 00:42:44.529]  So this lighthouse, out on this promontory with the waves smashing into it, was built to do this.
[00:42:44.529 --> 00:42:46.229]  And we're still standing.
[00:42:46.229 --> 00:42:48.270]  Only because of your prayers.
[00:42:48.270 --> 00:42:50.191]  We are in this together.
[00:42:50.191 --> 00:42:56.053]  And the minute we realize that, that our red blood binds us forever, is the day we touch God's face.
[00:42:58.462 --> 00:43:01.986]  I'm here to tell you I don't need you to thank me and tell me I've done a good job.
[00:43:01.986 --> 00:43:03.988]  I've done nothing but my duty!
[00:43:03.988 --> 00:43:12.997]  I discovered a bunch of bloodthirsty scum coming after innocent people and I've been fighting them for 13 years and I'll never stop!
[00:43:15.587 --> 00:43:40.976]  For 26 years, Alex Jones and Infowars have been sounding the alarm for patriots worldwide, waking people up to the New World Order, Bohemian Grove, the American Deep State, the rise of Communist China, the plan for global depopulation, and global elite pedophiles who prey off of our young.
[00:43:42.296 --> 00:43:48.700]  The enemy has done their best to destroy us, but because of your support, our fight continues.
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:54.343]  Join us, support the InfoWar, and together, we will slay the dragon.
[00:43:54.343 --> 00:43:59.626]  Keep fighting, Alex, you're the gladiator.
[00:43:59.626 --> 00:44:10.693]  Now that this UN global government shy-com Billimalinda Gates medical tyranny has seen how far they can push it now, we just lapped it up, like, like poison.
[00:44:12.091 --> 00:44:16.693]  You know now they're going to launch more bio-attacks that are even more hardcore.
[00:44:16.693 --> 00:44:22.176]  This early one does kill people, but see it's a virus Bill and Melinda Gates own.
[00:44:22.176 --> 00:44:26.899]  It's a virus that's novel from others so they can give you a vaccine.
[00:44:26.899 --> 00:44:31.601]  See, a regular cold or flu virus you really can't do a vaccine for because it's always mutated.
[00:44:31.601 --> 00:44:37.264]  But see, because this is a chimera and lab made, they can have a speciality.
[00:44:38.191 --> 00:44:39.773]  So it's a whole giant franchise.
[00:44:39.773 --> 00:44:41.535]  They get filthy rich off of it.
[00:44:41.535 --> 00:44:43.217]  They can surveil everybody.
[00:44:43.217 --> 00:44:44.979]  Everybody gets to become a suspect.
[00:44:44.979 --> 00:44:49.645]  And now when you have low numbers of death, it doesn't matter because they make a huge spectacle out of it.
[00:44:49.645 --> 00:44:54.010]  If you watch next year with the flu, it'll even be bigger as well.
[00:44:54.010 --> 00:44:56.634]  This is what they've done to us because we're a bunch of domesticated idiots.
[00:44:59.286 --> 00:45:04.269]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[00:45:04.269 --> 00:45:12.174]  Sure, coffee, candy, and other highly sugar-filled drinks can give you a short boost, but the crash always follows.
[00:45:12.174 --> 00:45:18.478]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go when you need a little help.
[00:45:18.478 --> 00:45:19.319]  TurboForce.
[00:45:19.759 --> 00:45:36.025]  Similar to other mix-in energy packets, TurboForce from InfoWars Life utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years across the world to provide focus, clarity, and a boost of energy when you need it.
[00:45:36.425 --> 00:45:43.533]  Turbo Force is certainly a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable and tasty energy.
[00:45:43.533 --> 00:45:51.020]  And speaking of affordable, you can even try Turbo Force for a limited time at an incredible 40% off.
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:58.088]  Don't wait till it's out of stock again and get Turbo Force right now only at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:45:59.841 --> 00:46:05.604]  The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think, even if it ends up hurting me short term.
[00:46:05.604 --> 00:46:12.008]  I believe in God, and I believe in the long run, it'll end up being better for myself and everybody else in this world we live together in.
[00:46:12.008 --> 00:46:15.530]  I understand what comes around, goes around, you reap what you sow, and I live that.
[00:46:15.530 --> 00:46:18.312]  And I fundamentally, at a cellular level, understand it.
[00:46:18.312 --> 00:46:19.673]  Now, if I would have...
[00:46:23.949 --> 00:46:24.609]  We're good to go.
[00:46:46.167 --> 00:46:53.435]  Because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis to make sure people were incentivized to up their body's defenses.
[00:46:53.435 --> 00:47:01.863]  But now I'm telling you, with the economic crisis going on, get your storable food now.
[00:47:01.863 --> 00:47:04.546]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:47:43.263 --> 00:47:44.844]  You gotta sign it all over.
[00:47:44.844 --> 00:47:46.344]  Your life.
[00:47:46.344 --> 00:47:48.765]  Your children's lives.
[00:47:48.765 --> 00:47:49.446]  Everything you've got.
[00:47:49.446 --> 00:47:54.068]  And it's not because you want to lose them.
[00:47:54.068 --> 00:47:56.289]  Or lose your own life.
[00:47:56.289 --> 00:47:58.469]  But if you don't.
[00:47:58.469 --> 00:48:00.110]  Bet it all.
[00:48:00.110 --> 00:48:01.771]  They're gonna use it against you.
[00:48:01.771 --> 00:48:02.611]  And then they got you.
[00:48:02.611 --> 00:48:05.212]  And then you're a slave.
[00:48:05.212 --> 00:48:06.773]  And all of us.
[00:48:06.773 --> 00:48:09.754]  And all of our peoples have been slaves before.
[00:48:09.754 --> 00:48:11.135]  And we dream of being free.
[00:48:12.521 --> 00:48:20.567]  And America, for all its sins, was that promise, that dream, that for so many was realized.
[00:48:20.567 --> 00:48:33.236]  And so it created incredible wealth and power, and then evil came here to try to take that power over and try to subvert it.
[00:48:33.236 --> 00:48:35.358]  And all they had to do was embrace it.
[00:48:36.641 --> 00:48:38.603]  And love humanity.
[00:48:38.603 --> 00:48:40.344]  And love competition.
[00:48:40.344 --> 00:48:44.067]  And embrace the animating contest.
[00:48:44.067 --> 00:48:44.327]  Alright.
[00:48:44.327 --> 00:48:47.269]  I want to go to your phone calls.
[00:48:47.269 --> 00:48:51.012]  I am so loaded for bear with videos and articles.
[00:48:51.012 --> 00:48:56.776]  And I've really been cogitating, meditating, thinking about what it is that upsets me so much that I have been
[00:48:57.870 --> 00:49:01.712]  Not even more angry, just more pissed at myself than I've ever been.
[00:49:01.712 --> 00:49:11.076]  And a lot of nights not sleeping and just sitting there in a chair for like two, three hours at a time, I've come up with it.
[00:49:11.076 --> 00:49:13.197]  And I know you're going through this because I know you're just like me.
[00:49:13.197 --> 00:49:17.479]  That's why I talk about it from my own perspective and then take your calls, your perspective, because I value that so much.
[00:49:17.479 --> 00:49:26.443]  It's like President Trump wants the real human perspective, not what came out of a TV, not what came off some mainstream thing, but what's real and authentic down the ground.
[00:49:28.103 --> 00:49:29.344]  There's nothing higher than the ground.
[00:49:29.344 --> 00:49:31.145]  That's where we're planted.
[00:49:31.145 --> 00:49:35.127]  Nothing bigger than the grass.
[00:49:35.127 --> 00:49:38.349]  That's what makes the whole thing survive.
[00:49:38.349 --> 00:49:45.293]  And... It's more of a feeling, it's hard to describe, but I know you know what I'm talking about.
[00:49:45.293 --> 00:49:45.373]  It's...
[00:49:46.741 --> 00:49:55.504]  We knew all this was coming, and we knew it was super evil, and we studied it, and it sounded crazy, and we all went through a lot of persecution and ridicule.
[00:49:55.504 --> 00:50:06.287]  A lot of folks lost their jobs, you name it, for talking about the New World Order and all this, and the world government, and the leftist agenda being evil.
[00:50:06.287 --> 00:50:09.328]  And then you thought, well, I got persecuted, maybe we held it off.
[00:50:10.609 --> 00:50:11.850]  You know, we've had some victories.
[00:50:11.850 --> 00:50:15.512]  Maybe, maybe, maybe they're not gonna really... Maybe the globalists don't mean it.
[00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:17.234]  You know, maybe that's talk with them.
[00:50:17.234 --> 00:50:21.437]  Maybe they're not gonna really, really do it.
[00:50:21.437 --> 00:50:22.357]  And then it hits home.
[00:50:22.357 --> 00:50:26.760]  No, they... They're doing it now.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:29.142]  The whole preparation, everything, they pull the trigger.
[00:50:29.142 --> 00:50:32.224]  And just exactly what we said the trigger would look like, they did.
[00:50:32.224 --> 00:50:33.525]  Because they said they would.
[00:50:33.525 --> 00:50:34.706]  Hell, they wrote all these books on it.
[00:50:36.246 --> 00:50:39.930]  And that's the thing is, wow, they really mean it, and they're going to do it.
[00:50:39.930 --> 00:50:55.966]  And it makes you kind of like, you know, grab ahold of your guts and say, man, I'm going to have to, like with some big, you know, six foot five killing machines coming at you, you're like, better, like, I better get myself together here.
[00:51:00.518 --> 00:51:07.421]  It's because we turned loose of God, we turned loose of our children, we stopped caring, and we just lost our soul.
[00:51:07.421 --> 00:51:09.682]  And now we're going to get hurt real bad.
[00:51:09.682 --> 00:51:11.743]  So everybody better get ready to get hurt real bad.
[00:51:11.743 --> 00:51:21.307]  We're going to make it through this, but let me tell you, man, I just have grief for this because they're going to take everything you've got until you're begging for their microchips and their world government.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.201]  You think you got plagues?
[00:51:23.201 --> 00:51:26.504]  Oh, you just passed the test grovel and they're going to hit you with plagues.
[00:51:26.504 --> 00:51:27.585]  They're going to hit me with them.
[00:51:27.585 --> 00:51:34.351]  And it's, there's nothing like, you know, you're about to get hit in the gut, but man, when they hit you in the gut, it's like different.
[00:51:34.351 --> 00:51:36.072]  Like you've been hit in the gut before, but they do it again.
[00:51:36.072 --> 00:51:38.515]  It's like, man, I just got hit in the gut.
[00:51:38.515 --> 00:51:41.097]  And that's really what this gut check moment is.
[00:51:41.097 --> 00:51:42.038]  What do you got in them guts?
[00:51:44.380 --> 00:52:00.914]  Because if you don't fight now, when it's out in the open world government and Satanism and pedophilia and 5G and forced inoculations, what are you gonna do when they send the high priest over to your house who's a pedophile dressed like a woman to screw your kid?
[00:52:00.914 --> 00:52:03.236]  You let him screw your kid?
[00:52:03.236 --> 00:52:04.657]  The big bank's gonna put $100,000 in your bank account.
[00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:11.492]  Or you're gonna go to jail!
[00:52:11.492 --> 00:52:14.775]  Or a bunch of leftists are gonna come burn your house down!
[00:52:14.775 --> 00:52:15.917]  Well, you know what?
[00:52:15.917 --> 00:52:18.139]  They do that to us, we do that to them!
[00:52:18.139 --> 00:52:23.585]  And the only reason I'm getting down to these points is we don't start stuff physically.
[00:52:23.585 --> 00:52:27.309]  But we finish it.
[00:52:27.309 --> 00:52:29.030]  And I'm just telling you where all this is going.
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:42.130]  And it makes me sick, because we should have been able to easily, intellectually, spiritually defeat this, but people gave up on God, just like the Old Testament over and over again.
[00:52:42.130 --> 00:52:45.953]  We gave up on all the stuff that makes damn sense and works.
[00:52:45.953 --> 00:52:48.455]  We pissed, oh, that's our parents, their grandparents.
[00:52:48.455 --> 00:52:49.596]  We don't need that.
[00:52:49.596 --> 00:52:50.977]  We know what we're doing.
[00:52:50.977 --> 00:52:54.540]  No, we didn't know what we were doing.
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:56.202]  And now we are eaten up by Satanists.
[00:53:00.199 --> 00:53:01.639]  But I don't want violence.
[00:53:01.639 --> 00:53:03.680]  I'm a peaceful person.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:05.781]  I'm for defense, though.
[00:53:05.781 --> 00:53:11.582]  And I just want you to remember that God's watching what you're doing.
[00:53:11.582 --> 00:53:13.783]  And they're going to stage mass shootings and blame it on us.
[00:53:13.783 --> 00:53:15.783]  We don't want violence.
[00:53:15.783 --> 00:53:21.765]  I'm simply explaining the fact that we better politically be engaged and involved now.
[00:53:23.749 --> 00:53:28.952]  To change things with our word of mouth and our action and our dollars and what we do.
[00:53:28.952 --> 00:53:32.094]  This isn't just some hobby where you fight the New World Order now.
[00:53:32.094 --> 00:53:34.896]  You're learning they'll lock your ass down on house arrest.
[00:53:34.896 --> 00:53:35.996]  You're a prisoner.
[00:53:35.996 --> 00:53:38.758]  You better put your full energy out.
[00:53:38.758 --> 00:53:44.221]  You better say hell no from the rooftops!
[00:53:44.221 --> 00:53:46.663]  Because not being active is what's gotten us to this point.
[00:53:49.022 --> 00:53:56.665]  They're following a scientific playbook of oppression with a high-tech modern overlay.
[00:53:56.665 --> 00:54:00.827]  But they're following an exact blueprint.
[00:54:00.827 --> 00:54:05.549]  And that's why people keep saying, okay, now the Internet's now like totally freaked out.
[00:54:05.549 --> 00:54:07.610]  Like used to, I was 50-50 being attacked.
[00:54:07.610 --> 00:54:09.731]  Now it's like 9% support.
[00:54:09.731 --> 00:54:10.231]  Great!
[00:54:10.231 --> 00:54:12.232]  I don't care less.
[00:54:12.232 --> 00:54:13.673]  I thought about me.
[00:54:13.673 --> 00:54:16.134]  But as a bellwether, people go, how the hell do you know this?
[00:54:16.134 --> 00:54:16.674]  How do you know that?
[00:54:18.567 --> 00:54:23.770]  Because psychos love to brag, and they told us everything they were gonna do.
[00:54:23.770 --> 00:54:30.593]  I didn't know criminology when I was younger, so I'd watch a movie, I'd watch a comic book movie, and the villain always brags about what he's doing to you.
[00:54:30.593 --> 00:54:32.154]  I thought, well, I was a villain.
[00:54:32.154 --> 00:54:33.935]  I wouldn't brag, I'd just kill your ass.
[00:54:33.935 --> 00:54:35.716]  But see, I wasn't a villain.
[00:54:35.716 --> 00:54:36.656]  I'm a hunter.
[00:54:36.656 --> 00:54:38.237]  I just get the job done because I want some food.
[00:54:38.237 --> 00:54:39.298]  I'm not out to hurt people.
[00:54:40.029 --> 00:54:47.554]  But a villain loves that they're better than you, and always when they got you tied down, they're going to sit there and tell you how they screwed you.
[00:54:47.554 --> 00:54:50.016]  Because they get off on their superiority.
[00:54:50.016 --> 00:54:52.598]  So I'm watching these supervillains wind this whole thing up.
[00:54:54.269 --> 00:55:03.277]  And I'm just like, folks, we really... They had all these plans, and they did everything they said they'd do, and now these creeps... If there's one thing about villains, they're neurotic.
[00:55:03.277 --> 00:55:04.458]  They're OCD, man.
[00:55:04.458 --> 00:55:12.644]  They follow their plans, which makes them hard to beat because they never stop, but it makes them easy to beat because you've got their battle plan.
[00:55:12.644 --> 00:55:14.966]  And that's what I'm like, telling the President.
[00:55:14.966 --> 00:55:21.452]  Can you imagine telling the President or his advisors?
[00:55:23.823 --> 00:55:26.324]  The stuff I say on there.
[00:55:26.324 --> 00:55:34.386]  Can you imagine when I've delivered the President packets of info with all the proof?
[00:55:34.386 --> 00:55:37.407]  Talk about, that's pretty cool, isn't it?
[00:55:37.407 --> 00:55:40.609]  But what does that say?
[00:55:40.609 --> 00:55:46.831]  It says we're so incredibly weak it takes some crazy dude from Texas to do it because everybody else is too scared.
[00:55:46.831 --> 00:55:47.951]  I'm scared to not do it.
[00:55:49.872 --> 00:55:52.033]  I mean, let these crazy people run everything?
[00:55:52.033 --> 00:55:53.894]  I mean, I'm doing this, I'm scared.
[00:55:53.894 --> 00:56:00.137]  I'm not doing this because I'm on some power trip, or I'm doing some, you know, measuring contest of how long my telewacker is.
[00:56:00.137 --> 00:56:03.219]  I'm doing this because I'm scared of these people.
[00:56:03.219 --> 00:56:07.401]  I just don't get rolling over to evil like that makes you safe.
[00:56:07.401 --> 00:56:11.282]  Like, oh, the big bad wolf just came to my house and ate half my family.
[00:56:11.282 --> 00:56:13.404]  But if I pet him, he'll eat me last.
[00:56:13.404 --> 00:56:14.764]  You know what?
[00:56:14.764 --> 00:56:16.145]  I'm gonna kill the big bad wolf.
[00:56:17.984 --> 00:56:21.425]  And that's all I'm saying is, why do we grovel?
[00:56:21.425 --> 00:56:25.606]  Because if the Big Bad Wolf knew he came in our house, we were gonna attack him, he'd run.
[00:56:25.606 --> 00:56:35.208]  But instead, when the Big Bad Wolf comes in, I used to watch, when I was a kid, like, Friday the 13th, and I was wondering, like, the people run through the woods and they see Jason, they fall down and crawl and scream and let him kill him.
[00:56:35.208 --> 00:56:36.908]  And I thought, that's ridiculous.
[00:56:36.908 --> 00:56:37.768]  I would fight.
[00:56:37.768 --> 00:56:39.188]  See, I was following my instincts.
[00:56:39.188 --> 00:56:46.570]  But I learned later, no, the average man or woman would actually fall down to some guy with a machete, instead of getting a rock or a stick and killing their ass, or at least fighting.
[00:56:47.614 --> 00:56:51.237]  And I thought, well, everybody's gonna like, get a rock or a stick or fight this out.
[00:56:51.237 --> 00:56:56.182]  Some dude pulls a machete on me, I'm gonna pick this table up and smash it over the head.
[00:56:56.182 --> 00:56:58.724]  I'm not some badass, I'll just kill your ass.
[00:56:58.724 --> 00:57:03.548]  I mean, I don't understand this, but see, everybody isn't a leader, folks.
[00:57:03.548 --> 00:57:07.272]  Most everybody else goes, like in the movies, oh, oh, oh, oh, don't kill me!
[00:57:07.272 --> 00:57:09.333]  No, please, don't!
[00:57:09.333 --> 00:57:10.755]  And that's why they get their ass killed.
[00:57:12.205 --> 00:57:14.726]  All I'm telling America and the world is this.
[00:57:14.726 --> 00:57:16.327]  Stop laying down.
[00:57:16.327 --> 00:57:17.908]  Stop kissing ass.
[00:57:17.908 --> 00:57:19.049]  Good people, work with them.
[00:57:19.049 --> 00:57:19.509]  Work together.
[00:57:19.509 --> 00:57:20.549]  That's a great thing.
[00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:23.751]  But don't let them twist that instinct to lay down a tyranny.
[00:57:23.751 --> 00:57:25.352]  Your phone calls are coming up.
[00:57:25.352 --> 00:57:26.252]  I'll say this.
[00:57:26.252 --> 00:57:28.754]  I need money to fight these wars.
[00:57:28.754 --> 00:57:30.155]  And you're the one in my sales.
[00:57:30.155 --> 00:57:31.235]  We got products you need.
[00:57:31.235 --> 00:57:32.616]  Food back in stock.
[00:57:32.616 --> 00:57:33.616]  X2 back in stock.
[00:57:33.616 --> 00:57:34.617]  And so much more.
[00:57:34.617 --> 00:57:35.737]  You fund us?
[00:57:35.737 --> 00:57:37.598]  Well, then the punch I hit them with is more powerful.
[00:57:37.598 --> 00:57:38.199]  Like a video game.
[00:57:38.199 --> 00:57:39.019]  You fund us?
[00:57:39.019 --> 00:57:39.279]  Boom!
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:41.500]  Ah, you don't?
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:42.601]  Get my ass kicked.
[00:57:42.601 --> 00:57:43.821]  Told them God's plan, I'm not worried.
[00:57:43.821 --> 00:57:48.023]  I turned it over to Jehovah.
[00:57:48.023 --> 00:57:52.865]  Ten weeks ago, I began to tell listeners that they needed to get high quality, affordable food.
[00:57:52.865 --> 00:58:04.050]  Not because of the virus, but because of the crises and the economic shutdown it would cause because the globalists were planning to hold America hostage and run a blockade through the blue cities and blue states.
[00:58:04.810 --> 00:58:09.232]  Now that prediction has come true, because the globalists are running an operation.
[00:58:09.232 --> 00:58:11.173]  It's not predictions.
[00:58:11.173 --> 00:58:13.474]  We have their battle plans.
[00:58:13.474 --> 00:58:21.738]  So, going back more than eight weeks ago, all major storable food companies were sold out, except My Patriot Supply, because they're the biggest and we're pre-positioned.
[00:58:21.738 --> 00:58:29.762]  When it got to the point that they had so many orders coming in that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them in a timely manner, they stopped taking orders until they got caught back up.
[00:58:29.762 --> 00:58:29.922]  Well,
[00:58:30.422 --> 00:58:31.383]  Now they're caught back up.
[00:58:31.383 --> 00:58:35.207]  They've got high quality storable food in stock, ready to be packaged and shipped to you.
[00:58:35.207 --> 00:58:43.635]  Get your orders in now at InfoWarStore.com to go right at the head of the queue and get delivered to you as fast as possible and from the Employer.
[00:58:43.635 --> 00:58:46.198]  Get your storable food now at InfoWarStore.com.
[00:58:48.188 --> 00:58:55.093]  There's a process where you take a stallion and you tie him down and you cut his testicles off and then he becomes gelded.
[00:58:55.093 --> 00:58:57.835]  Well, that's what's happening to the entire world right now.
[00:58:57.835 --> 00:58:59.916]  We're going into deep, deep tyranny.
[00:58:59.916 --> 00:59:02.758]  Places like North Korea and China are going into deeper tyranny as well.
[00:59:02.758 --> 00:59:04.419]  It's all directed by the UN.
[00:59:04.419 --> 00:59:06.781]  It's all a big, cooked up, giant plan.
[00:59:07.461 --> 00:59:12.844]  To absolutely take control of your life, bankrupt the economy, and make you dependent on the big mega banks.
[00:59:12.844 --> 00:59:19.948]  And to get your universal income, you're going to have to take the inoculations, brainwash your kids the way they say, and have absolutely no freedom.
[00:59:19.948 --> 00:59:22.129]  And it's all happening, boom, overnight.
[00:59:22.129 --> 00:59:24.150]  This is a giant revolution.
[00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:28.052]  And as soon as you put the handcuffs on, they said, oh, it's just an extended spring break, two weeks.
[00:59:28.052 --> 00:59:30.833]  Notice now it's 18 months, two years, five years.
[00:59:30.833 --> 00:59:31.974]  It never ends.
[00:59:31.974 --> 00:59:34.155]  No one can ever die from a virus again.
[00:59:34.155 --> 00:59:35.056]  Government will save you.
[00:59:36.036 --> 00:59:37.277]  It's a takeover.
[00:59:37.277 --> 00:59:38.038]  It's the opposite.
[00:59:38.038 --> 00:59:51.812]  They're coming with forced inoculations on record that will reduce your fertility, lower your immunity, and in many cases, kill you, and they're telling you it's gonna hurt a lot of people.
[00:59:51.812 --> 00:59:54.435]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.469 --> 01:00:06.152]  Look at this doctor going public.
[01:00:06.152 --> 01:00:15.407]  It was in Idaho, and New York, and California, and Mississippi, and Texas, and Michigan, and just everywhere.
[01:00:15.407 --> 01:00:18.312]  And these two guys have a whole bunch of clinics across the state.
[01:00:20.054 --> 01:00:23.816]  And they're well known, and they're telling you stuff you already know is true.
[01:00:23.816 --> 01:00:33.822]  96% of people in California who get COVID recover with almost no significant sequelae or no significant continuing medical problems.
[01:00:33.822 --> 01:00:36.084]  COVID-19 is one aspect of our health sector.
[01:00:36.884 --> 01:00:42.509]  What has it caused to have us be involved in social isolation?
[01:00:42.509 --> 01:00:42.949]  What is it?
[01:00:42.949 --> 01:00:47.172]  What is the cause that we are seeing the community respond to?
[01:00:47.172 --> 01:00:50.555]  Child molestation is increasing at a severe rate.
[01:00:50.555 --> 01:00:55.219]  We could go over multiple cases of children who have been molested due to angry
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:01:01.024]  Family members who are intoxicated, who are home, who have no paycheck.
[01:01:01.024 --> 01:01:02.805]  These things last a lifetime.
[01:01:02.805 --> 01:01:04.827]  This isn't about a seasonal flu.
[01:01:04.827 --> 01:01:10.072]  These are things that will follow these people and affect them in a negative fashion for their life.
[01:01:10.072 --> 01:01:12.294]  And these are secondary effects from COVID.
[01:01:12.294 --> 01:01:19.000]  And these are for me talking to ERs, talking to my doctors, and talking to people across the country and finding out what they're seeing.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:19.680]  Spousal abuse.
[01:01:20.578 --> 01:01:24.060]  We see people coming in here with black eyes and cuts on their face.
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:25.961]  It's an obvious abuse of case.
[01:01:25.961 --> 01:01:30.224]  These are things that will affect them for a lifetime, not for a season.
[01:01:30.224 --> 01:01:33.606]  Alcoholism, anxiety, depression, suicide.
[01:01:33.606 --> 01:01:38.649]  I talked to Donnie Youngblood and various people in the community.
[01:01:38.649 --> 01:01:40.770]  I've asked them, how are things going?
[01:01:40.770 --> 01:01:42.231]  Suicide is spiking.
[01:01:42.231 --> 01:01:43.632]  Education has dropped off.
[01:01:43.632 --> 01:01:44.513]  Economic collapse.
[01:01:45.353 --> 01:01:50.657]  Medical industry, we're all suffering because our staff isn't here, and we have no volume.
[01:01:50.657 --> 01:01:53.159]  These are all real things that I'm seeing every day.
[01:01:53.159 --> 01:01:54.560]  I don't read about this stuff.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:56.321]  I'm seeing it in my clinics.
[01:01:56.321 --> 01:02:00.865]  We have clinics from Fresno to San Diego, and these things are spiking in our community.
[01:02:00.865 --> 01:02:04.027]  These things will affect people for a lifetime, not for a season.
[01:02:04.027 --> 01:02:07.049]  And I've talked to, you know, the head of the CDPH.
[01:02:07.049 --> 01:02:11.173]  I've gotten their opinion on this, and a lot of the leaders in Sacramento.
[01:02:11.173 --> 01:02:12.373]  And we're all in agreement.
[01:02:13.214 --> 01:02:18.377]  But we need to have Governor Newsom in agreement with us to lift this ban.
[01:02:18.377 --> 01:02:20.458]  It's this stuff that'll kill the New World Order, folks.
[01:02:20.458 --> 01:02:22.640]  This is real medical information.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:23.780]  It's everything you've already heard here.
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:25.521]  It's everything you always knew.
[01:02:25.521 --> 01:02:30.224]  When you were a little kid and got sick, you could be 70 years old, you know Mama said, go out and get some sun.
[01:02:30.224 --> 01:02:31.505]  And then we're told today...
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:35.783]  Arrest people that give hope and say that.
[01:02:35.783 --> 01:02:43.909]  Arresting someone for sitting alone on the beach, tell me how that arrests the spread of the coronavirus from an epidemiological point of view.
[01:02:45.137 --> 01:02:46.498]  Yeah, I wasn't referring to that.
[01:02:46.498 --> 01:02:49.340]  I actually don't have the specifics as to why that happened.
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:03:01.750]  The Bill of Rights, as you well know, protects Americans' right and shrines their right to practice their religion as they see fit and to congregate together to assemble peacefully.
[01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:06.774]  By what authority did you nullify the Bill of Rights in issuing this order?
[01:03:06.774 --> 01:03:08.175]  How do you have the power to do that?
[01:03:09.144 --> 01:03:14.648]  That's above my pay grade, Tucker, so I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this.
[01:03:14.648 --> 01:03:27.176]  COVID-19 is going to be in our lives for at least the next year or until there's a vaccine, and we need to figure out a way to get back to as normal of a life as possible while this plays out in the background.
[01:03:27.176 --> 01:03:30.017]  The solution is not to lock us into our homes.
[01:03:30.017 --> 01:03:31.619]  See, Thomas Malthus, 260 years ago, said,
[01:03:38.479 --> 01:03:44.100]  Depopulation should be the highest priority of foreign policy towards the third world.
[01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:44.480]  Henry Kissinger, 1974.
[01:04:09.548 --> 01:04:20.480]  Now, there's a need for a new world order, but it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:30.911]  Now, none of this may succeed this time, but this to me is sort of the outline by which someday, in the next few years,
[01:04:32.512 --> 01:04:34.793]  A solution will emerge.
[01:04:34.793 --> 01:04:36.815]  And let me tell you, we're all in danger.
[01:04:36.815 --> 01:04:52.764]  Because if you want to follow right down from Plato, to Malthus, to Galton, to Hitler, to Bill Gates, the apple don't fall far from the tree, because it's the same tree.
[01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:55.126]  Your phone calls are 60 seconds away.
[01:04:57.228 --> 01:05:05.155]  Globalism is all about making the nation-state and the population itself obsolete, non-essential.
[01:05:05.155 --> 01:05:17.626]  That's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes, and controls to where family farms and industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate.
[01:05:17.626 --> 01:05:23.672]  That's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out,
[01:05:24.232 --> 01:05:28.515]  They can simply look at us and say, because again, you are not essential.
[01:05:28.515 --> 01:05:31.538]  That's what the robots and all of this is about.
[01:05:31.538 --> 01:05:35.701]  It's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives.
[01:05:35.701 --> 01:05:39.524]  We can be told to stay in our houses, and after all, shut up!
[01:05:39.524 --> 01:05:41.185]  This world doesn't belong to people anyways.
[01:05:41.185 --> 01:05:45.688]  It belongs to the new AI gods, the rich elitists that have merged with machines.
[01:05:45.688 --> 01:05:47.490]  Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[01:05:48.277 --> 01:05:51.401]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing.
[01:05:51.401 --> 01:05:55.887]  These people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[01:06:00.359 --> 01:06:08.484]  Don't act so surprised.
[01:06:08.484 --> 01:06:09.604]  Big Brother.
[01:06:09.604 --> 01:06:11.405]  Mainstream media.
[01:06:11.405 --> 01:06:13.287]  Government cover-ups.
[01:06:13.287 --> 01:06:15.008]  You want to stop tyranny?
[01:06:15.008 --> 01:06:16.648]  Well, so does he.
[01:06:16.648 --> 01:06:22.112]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:24.613]  Don't act so surprised, Bill Gates.
[01:06:24.613 --> 01:06:27.695]  You didn't think America would roll over so easily, did you?
[01:06:29.770 --> 01:06:34.712]  A lot of people have been working behind the scenes while you were working.
[01:06:34.712 --> 01:06:39.273]  We don't need an internet to communicate.
[01:06:39.273 --> 01:06:44.194]  Don't be too proud of this technological terror you constructed, Bill Gates.
[01:06:44.194 --> 01:06:50.156]  The ability to exterminate the third world is insignificant next to the power of the Holy Spirit.
[01:06:59.574 --> 01:07:01.536]  All right.
[01:07:01.536 --> 01:07:05.459]  Let me be a good boy, because I'm not going to calls because of lack of news.
[01:07:05.459 --> 01:07:08.121]  I want to hear from callers.
[01:07:08.121 --> 01:07:09.623]  You could dispense with the pleasantries.
[01:07:09.623 --> 01:07:12.025]  That's another Darth Vader quote.
[01:07:12.025 --> 01:07:17.369]  And let's just get right to the meat of it, as long as the next person, because I respect each of you, and I appreciate you calling me.
[01:07:17.369 --> 01:07:25.156]  Mike, Brendan, Brendan, Rick, Joe, Cowboy, Hunter, Carlos, Jeff, and many others.
[01:07:25.156 --> 01:07:27.018]  And let's go first to
[01:07:28.643 --> 01:07:33.125]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:07:33.125 --> 01:07:37.407]  Well, cowboys are reckless and wild, so they always go to the front of the line.
[01:07:37.407 --> 01:07:40.649]  Cowboy in Oregon, go ahead.
[01:07:40.649 --> 01:07:42.090]  Hey Alex, thank God.
[01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:43.871]  Oh my, good speaking to you.
[01:07:43.871 --> 01:07:45.332]  Thank you for my call.
[01:07:45.332 --> 01:07:46.212]  Thank you for calling, brother.
[01:07:46.212 --> 01:07:48.153]  What's on your mind today?
[01:07:48.153 --> 01:07:57.498]  What's on my mind today is I seen yesterday, this is going on what you were talking about, how the Democrats were talking about suspending the elections.
[01:07:58.396 --> 01:08:06.721]  Governor Cuomo in New York has suspended the Democratic election there.
[01:08:06.721 --> 01:08:13.586]  Citizens actually need to stand up and say, no, we need to have our elections, Democratic, Republican, Independent, doesn't matter.
[01:08:13.586 --> 01:08:14.927]  We need to have our elections.
[01:08:14.927 --> 01:08:16.008]  It's right.
[01:08:16.008 --> 01:08:20.971]  Because without elections, there's no president and then they can put whoever they want in.
[01:08:20.971 --> 01:08:22.392]  That's not right.
[01:08:22.392 --> 01:08:25.694]  I also want to plug in for a second.
[01:08:26.468 --> 01:08:31.453]  I've been taking your lung cleanse for about a month and a half now.
[01:08:31.453 --> 01:08:34.436]  The reason why I'm a cowboy is I work here at a cow ranch.
[01:08:35.296 --> 01:08:38.077]  I've been working here for four months, five months going on now.
[01:08:38.077 --> 01:08:41.057]  By the way, a lot of folks think cowboys are only in Texas.
[01:08:41.057 --> 01:08:45.018]  That's actually a Spanish name for like one of the hands that was younger working with cows.
[01:08:45.018 --> 01:08:46.438]  Goes back to Spain a thousand years.
[01:08:46.438 --> 01:08:50.759]  But Oregon and California were bigger cowboy areas than Texas.
[01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:54.200]  For folks that don't know, because all the hills and the work you got to do there.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:58.281]  Texas is easy cowboying with those big planes.
[01:08:58.281 --> 01:08:59.701]  Correct.
[01:08:59.701 --> 01:09:02.362]  You got all planes there and it's easy to maneuver the cows.
[01:09:03.206 --> 01:09:04.427]  Oregon and California.
[01:09:04.427 --> 01:09:08.610]  Yeah, real cowboys like in Spain where they got the hills just like in Oregon.
[01:09:08.610 --> 01:09:09.071]  Yes, sir.
[01:09:09.071 --> 01:09:10.251]  You're correct about that.
[01:09:10.251 --> 01:09:13.934]  Yes, we do handle cows and that's what the original name cowboy came from.
[01:09:13.934 --> 01:09:18.698]  Not for them cowboys that run on the horses and, you know, tie up the cows in that way.
[01:09:18.698 --> 01:09:19.238]  It's not that.
[01:09:19.238 --> 01:09:24.522]  It's actually the men that handle the cow ranches here at the feedlots and everything.
[01:09:24.522 --> 01:09:30.107]  And here lately, I've been seeing some quite a few cows here lately been dying off.
[01:09:30.107 --> 01:09:31.768]  Even calves here at the feedlot.
[01:09:32.332 --> 01:09:33.674]  You're just making me scratch my head.
[01:09:33.674 --> 01:09:36.158]  I have not asked any questions about what's going on.
[01:09:36.158 --> 01:09:42.127]  I don't know if it's like the COVID-19 or anything, but here lately we've been getting some cows that are just dying over.
[01:09:43.099 --> 01:09:47.202]  Well, you didn't see the senior cowboy giving those special rain tubes.
[01:09:47.202 --> 01:09:49.923]  They can get dispensation and payoffs on those.
[01:09:49.923 --> 01:09:57.107]  We actually led with a show that they've got a program through the federal government to kill your cows off.
[01:09:57.107 --> 01:09:58.308]  Trump doesn't know about this, folks.
[01:09:58.308 --> 01:10:01.710]  By the way, I don't know what's going on across the street in my own office with 100 employees.
[01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:04.012]  They're great people, but I'm not giving Trump cover.
[01:10:04.012 --> 01:10:04.652]  He just doesn't know.
[01:10:04.652 --> 01:10:06.473]  Every time he learns about something, he does the right thing.
[01:10:06.473 --> 01:10:11.056]  They've got a program to kill the cows off to basically just shut the country down and make us dependent on
[01:10:11.696 --> 01:10:12.396]  Foreign beef.
[01:10:12.396 --> 01:10:14.317]  Did you know about that?
[01:10:14.317 --> 01:10:14.977]  No, sir.
[01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:16.538]  I did not know about that.
[01:10:16.538 --> 01:10:21.240]  So tell me, did the cows die on the open range or did they die at the feedlot?
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:25.521]  They've been dying here at the feedlot.
[01:10:25.521 --> 01:10:29.983]  Well, you know, my dear Watson, the deduction is the key to this.
[01:10:29.983 --> 01:10:34.285]  And so, if they die at the feedlot, the number one thing will be the water or the feed they're being fed.
[01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:39.802]  Through that, or the medicines that they give shots to.
[01:10:39.802 --> 01:10:41.864]  They give shots to them and everything.
[01:10:41.864 --> 01:10:44.666]  I don't know what's in that medicine.
[01:10:44.666 --> 01:10:46.848]  Let me explain.
[01:10:46.848 --> 01:10:48.489]  Is it prime beef?
[01:10:48.489 --> 01:10:51.232]  What kind of beef you got there?
[01:10:51.232 --> 01:10:52.733]  It's prime beef.
[01:10:52.733 --> 01:10:54.094]  We got jerseys.
[01:10:54.094 --> 01:10:55.396]  I don't understand.
[01:10:55.396 --> 01:11:00.220]  So if you've got prime beef and it can't be delivered to the slaughterhouse,
[01:11:01.502 --> 01:11:04.165]  I have not seen any FOMA out of the mouth yet.
[01:11:24.434 --> 01:11:27.095]  They're coughing a lot.
[01:11:27.095 --> 01:11:28.155]  Doing that number.
[01:11:28.155 --> 01:11:30.276]  That's what cyanide does.
[01:11:30.276 --> 01:11:32.857]  That's the cheapest poison.
[01:11:32.857 --> 01:11:35.018]  So they're huffing to death but there's not foam.
[01:11:35.018 --> 01:11:36.698]  But normally that's what I'm talking about.
[01:11:36.698 --> 01:11:37.859]  Alright, God bless you brother.
[01:11:37.859 --> 01:11:38.659]  I appreciate your call.
[01:11:40.182 --> 01:11:42.083]  Let me air Gregory's short report.
[01:11:42.083 --> 01:11:44.285]  This is a farmer from North Texas.
[01:11:44.285 --> 01:11:46.966]  He's also got a ranch in Colorado.
[01:11:46.966 --> 01:11:52.029]  And again, I've got a ranch and I do some ranching, so I know a little bit about cows.
[01:11:52.029 --> 01:11:54.431]  Let's just say no hat, all cattle.
[01:11:54.431 --> 01:11:59.294]  But let's go ahead and play that report as we go to break about
[01:12:02.062 --> 01:12:06.325]  The federal government saying, kill off your cattle and offering money to do it.
[01:12:06.325 --> 01:12:13.389]  And then they've got vets that are going out injecting the cattle with poison that kills them in about two minutes.
[01:12:13.389 --> 01:12:22.654]  And then usually when you get a sign, that's what you, that's what I was describing as you didn't see foam, I guess these cows mouths, but I know how it's done here.
[01:12:22.654 --> 01:12:24.035]  Let's go ahead and roll that report.
[01:12:26.018 --> 01:12:36.484]  Chad Sullivan, Regional Director of R-Calf USA, is a fifth-generation Colorado rancher and recently delivered this message.
[01:12:36.484 --> 01:12:43.948]  Hey everybody, this is Chad Sullivan coming to you from the headwaters of Bitter Creek, Archer County, North Texas.
[01:12:43.948 --> 01:12:44.769]  We have to talk.
[01:12:46.095 --> 01:13:04.161]  State officials will be assisting to help identify potential alternative markets if a producer is unable to move animals, and if necessary, advise and assist on depopulation and disposal methods.
[01:13:04.161 --> 01:13:11.863]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are plowing under vegetable crops from coast to coast.
[01:13:11.863 --> 01:13:14.444]  We are euthanizing millions of chickens.
[01:13:15.819 --> 01:13:23.084]  We are aborting sows and burying feeder pigs.
[01:13:23.084 --> 01:13:33.432]  We are dumping milk by the hundreds of thousands of gallons and now they are preparing us to depopulate the fat cattle
[01:13:34.582 --> 01:13:41.167]  Ready to harvest because of a bottleneck created by the effects of COVID.
[01:13:41.167 --> 01:13:48.732]  This thing hasn't been created by COVID, but the effects of COVID and the logistics therein.
[01:13:48.732 --> 01:14:00.400]  Yesterday, the first shipment of imported beef from the country of Namibia hit the shores of the United States of America.
[01:14:01.934 --> 01:14:09.798]  And yet this morning, they are telling us to prepare to euthanize harvest-ready cattle.
[01:14:09.798 --> 01:14:12.360]  It is time we get food on the shelves.
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:20.604]  Because if you're not concerned about this food supply problem, you better be.
[01:14:20.604 --> 01:14:26.307]  We have a huge supply and demand of food across this nation.
[01:14:26.307 --> 01:14:30.149]  We can feed the world ourselves, and yet we're destroying our harvests.
[01:14:32.617 --> 01:14:45.352]  At the same time, we are importing beef from other countries, beef that is less regulated than our beef, less safe, not as high quality of product, and yet it's happening.
[01:14:45.352 --> 01:14:49.637]  At the same time, they are preparing for us to euthanize
[01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:51.990]  By the way.
[01:15:19.679 --> 01:15:24.028]  And while American farmers are destroying their harvests, U.S.
[01:15:24.028 --> 01:15:25.992]  beef is exported to China.
[01:15:27.708 --> 01:15:28.028]  U.S.
[01:15:28.028 --> 01:15:30.510]  meat plants are closing at a rapid rate.
[01:15:30.510 --> 01:15:31.450]  China's open for business.
[01:15:31.450 --> 01:15:35.613]  Including Cargill Meat, who supplies 22% of the U.S.
[01:15:35.613 --> 01:15:36.534]  meat market.
[01:15:36.534 --> 01:15:37.014]  Father Daniels.
[01:15:37.014 --> 01:15:49.381]  And who partnered with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2018 to end livestock production, while expanding the production of genetically modified soy in Africa.
[01:15:49.381 --> 01:15:50.922]  Sterilizes you.

[01:16:58.898 --> 01:17:02.140]  I'm talking thick, meaty, center cut, presidential bacon.
[01:17:02.140 --> 01:17:03.721]  Savory and delicious.
[01:17:03.721 --> 01:17:06.562]  I buy some, I use some, I store some.
[01:17:06.562 --> 01:17:07.223]  Awesome.

[01:17:57.365 --> 01:18:03.327]  The America that we've known and loved, the America that was the land of the free, home of the brave, is dying right now.
[01:18:03.327 --> 01:18:10.089]  And everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating us, shutting us down, and making us dependent on them.
[01:18:10.089 --> 01:18:12.130]  The food shortages have begun.
[01:18:12.130 --> 01:18:15.071]  The depression is going to be long and very, very serious.
[01:18:15.071 --> 01:18:17.252]  In fact, it's probably too late now to even turn back.
[01:18:17.252 --> 01:18:18.212]  Trump tried to stop it.
[01:18:18.792 --> 01:18:21.333]  But the mainstream media working with the Stratocom has blocked it.
[01:18:21.333 --> 01:18:25.855]  That's why you and myself, everybody else, has to get prepared now.

[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:40.681]  There are major shortages.
[01:18:41.241 --> 01:18:46.126]  This is a globalist siege, a globalist lockdown, globalist terrorism.
[01:18:46.126 --> 01:18:49.389]  But we the people, the patriots, have to be prepared.
[01:18:49.389 --> 01:18:51.291]  We've already been proven right about prepping so far.
[01:18:51.291 --> 01:18:52.733]  We'll get ready to be really proven right.

[01:18:57.153 --> 01:19:00.176]  It doesn't matter how hard I want to fight.
[01:19:00.176 --> 01:19:08.063]  If other human beings don't resonate with what I'm saying, if you don't spread the word, if you don't buy the products to fund our operation, the dog doesn't hunt.
[01:19:08.063 --> 01:19:08.984]  But you get that.
[01:19:08.984 --> 01:19:10.045]  You are patriots.
[01:19:10.045 --> 01:19:15.310]  You are people that live and work in the real world of a race, color, and creed that understand what's happening.
[01:19:15.310 --> 01:19:18.933]  And that's why when you call in and thank me for what I've done, it's really a sick joke.
[01:19:18.933 --> 01:19:19.434]  Thank you.
[01:19:20.094 --> 01:19:20.775]  For what you've done.
[01:19:20.775 --> 01:19:21.836]  We're all in this together.
[01:19:21.836 --> 01:19:23.598]  We believe in the rights of the unborn.
[01:19:23.598 --> 01:19:24.639]  We believe in families.
[01:19:24.639 --> 01:19:26.421]  We believe in the right to self-defense.
[01:19:26.421 --> 01:19:30.005]  We believe in capitalism in America and Jesus Christ, number one.
[01:19:30.005 --> 01:19:31.867]  And we believe in free speech.
[01:19:31.867 --> 01:19:38.155]  And so, the fact that you shop with us, and the fact that you spread the word about what we're doing, does everything in the world.
[01:19:38.795 --> 01:19:45.240]  That's why I salute you and I thank you continually because the globalists thought they'd have this whole planet sewn up by now.
[01:19:45.240 --> 01:19:46.360]  They thought they'd be in charge.
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:51.684]  They thought they would have won, but they didn't count on you and I and others coming together.
[01:19:51.684 --> 01:19:59.730]  So God bless you all.
[01:19:59.730 --> 01:20:02.332]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:08.019 --> 01:20:36.290]  Old pirates, yes they rob I Sold I to the merchant ships Minutes after they took I From the bottomless pit But my hand was made strong By the hand of the Almighty We forward in this generation
[01:20:47.728 --> 01:20:50.109]  Songs of freedom.
[01:20:50.109 --> 01:20:56.813]  All I've ever had.
[01:20:56.813 --> 01:20:59.534]  I only took two calls last segment.
[01:20:59.534 --> 01:21:01.395]  Let me take more of them now.
[01:21:01.395 --> 01:21:02.496]  So much big stuff happening.
[01:21:04.173 --> 01:21:07.656]  Imagine the full assault that's now happening.
[01:21:07.656 --> 01:21:12.861]  It's not like, oh, there'll be martial law and forced inoculations and drones and it's all here.
[01:21:12.861 --> 01:21:18.366]  It's like, wow, they really, they really meant it.
[01:21:20.196 --> 01:21:21.837]  I mean, I knew it was coming.
[01:21:21.837 --> 01:21:24.118]  Imagine the general public didn't know it was coming.
[01:21:24.118 --> 01:21:25.319]  I knew it was coming.
[01:21:25.319 --> 01:21:27.500]  And I'm completely freaked out.
[01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:30.201]  I drove to work this morning at 5.30 a.m.
[01:21:30.201 --> 01:21:33.283]  because I got a lot of work to do.
[01:21:33.283 --> 01:21:37.925]  And there's usually only a few cars on the road at 5 a.m.
[01:21:37.925 --> 01:21:41.067]  There was nobody on the road.
[01:21:41.067 --> 01:21:44.469]  I drove all the way to my house, to my office.
[01:21:45.709 --> 01:21:49.192]  And I did not see one car.
[01:21:49.192 --> 01:21:55.197]  Like an apocalypse.
[01:21:55.197 --> 01:21:57.599]  Generations are gonna feel this shutdown.
[01:21:57.599 --> 01:22:00.121]  See, I run a pretty good-sized company, so I know how things work.
[01:22:00.121 --> 01:22:02.924]  Like enough product to sell, to keep everybody employed.
[01:22:02.924 --> 01:22:05.266]  You gotta know how much money you got to buy more product.
[01:22:05.266 --> 01:22:08.008]  You know, just to get the word out, I gotta be a businessman.
[01:22:08.008 --> 01:22:10.811]  So then I know what it means to just shut something off.
[01:22:10.811 --> 01:22:11.111]  Boom!
[01:22:14.266 --> 01:22:17.929]  If we weren't positioned to fight the globalists, we'd already be shut down.
[01:22:17.929 --> 01:22:25.015]  Restaurants I've gone to since I was a baby are closed.
[01:22:25.015 --> 01:22:27.357]  People go, why is Trump being all confident?
[01:22:27.357 --> 01:22:31.601]  Because he knows if he isn't confident, we'll go into total depression.
[01:22:31.601 --> 01:22:34.304]  I'm talking about nothing at the store.
[01:22:34.304 --> 01:22:39.308]  We're like... I don't want to say this, folks, but I got to be honest with you.
[01:22:42.694 --> 01:22:45.917]  It's about a 60% chance we go into total collapse.
[01:22:45.917 --> 01:22:48.499]  And I mean, power going off sometimes.
[01:22:48.499 --> 01:22:49.860]  I mean, babies starving to death.
[01:22:49.860 --> 01:22:51.201]  I mean, you ain't getting your medicine.
[01:22:51.201 --> 01:22:52.542]  I mean, it's done.
[01:22:52.542 --> 01:23:01.530]  And there's one thing I want to say, and I'm not a vindictive person, but I'm not taking the blame, and America shouldn't take the blame.
[01:23:01.530 --> 01:23:03.511]  David Rockefeller, who set all this stuff up,
[01:23:04.386 --> 01:23:12.467]  Bill and Belinda Gates, the Democratic Party, the MSM, the people that went along with this.
[01:23:12.467 --> 01:23:14.168]  And again, here's the deal.
[01:23:14.168 --> 01:23:17.528]  If we don't assess blame, they're going to blame us when it all goes down.
[01:23:17.528 --> 01:23:22.409]  I just want to make sure that we make lemonade out of lemons.
[01:23:22.409 --> 01:23:26.390]  I never think about losing.
[01:23:26.390 --> 01:23:32.591]  And for the first time in my life, folks, I'm thinking about trying to get lemonade out of lemons.
[01:23:32.591 --> 01:23:32.911]  Seriously.
[01:23:39.909 --> 01:23:43.250]  Sweet, sweet Jesus, help us.
[01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:47.731]  Because, I'll go to your calls, but let me, you know, let's just go to your calls.
[01:23:47.731 --> 01:23:59.035]  I'll say it next segment, but... You understand it's not just rhetoric when I tell you about the depression.
[01:23:59.035 --> 01:24:00.195]  You can go look this up yourself.
[01:24:00.195 --> 01:24:07.097]  90% of people lived in the country.
[01:24:07.097 --> 01:24:09.098]  About half of those were self-sufficient.
[01:24:12.452 --> 01:24:19.637]  That's 45% of people were totally self-sufficient.
[01:24:19.637 --> 01:24:23.260]  Today it's 5%.
[01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:27.083]  We have a collapse.
[01:24:27.083 --> 01:24:28.604]  Here's why I felt so sick.
[01:24:28.604 --> 01:24:29.125]  I'll admit it.
[01:24:33.577 --> 01:24:34.918]  I'm just gonna be honest.
[01:24:34.918 --> 01:24:36.659]  My superpower is being honest.
[01:24:36.659 --> 01:24:46.883]  I've extrapolated this out, and I won't have to for a few years since I got food and stuff, but I'm literally looking at my neighbors now and going, am I ready to hang them up and gut them and skin them and chop them up?
[01:24:46.883 --> 01:24:47.223]  You know what?
[01:24:47.223 --> 01:24:47.804]  I'm ready.
[01:24:47.804 --> 01:24:49.425]  My daughters aren't starving to death.
[01:24:49.425 --> 01:24:50.845]  I'll eat my neighbors.
[01:24:50.845 --> 01:24:53.666]  See, my superpower is being honest.
[01:24:53.666 --> 01:24:55.047]  I'll eat your ass.
[01:24:55.047 --> 01:24:55.247]  I will.
[01:24:57.932 --> 01:24:58.913]  Combat model.
[01:24:58.913 --> 01:25:00.654]  Optimal self-sufficiency.
[01:25:00.654 --> 01:25:02.115]  Probably the leader.
[01:25:02.115 --> 01:25:04.718]  The point is, is have you thought about that yet?
[01:25:04.718 --> 01:25:11.143]  Because I'm somebody that thought I could fix this, and I'm starting to think about having to eat my neighbors.
[01:25:11.143 --> 01:25:18.429]  You think I like sizing up my neighbor how I'm gonna haul him up by a chain and chop his ass up?
[01:25:18.429 --> 01:25:20.190]  I'll do it!
[01:25:20.190 --> 01:25:22.813]  My children aren't going hungry!
[01:25:22.813 --> 01:25:24.054]  I will eat your ass!
[01:25:25.785 --> 01:25:29.089]  That's why I want the globalists to know, I will eat your ass first.
[01:25:29.089 --> 01:25:31.712]  You're not, we're going to dig you out of those bunkers.
[01:25:31.712 --> 01:25:33.895]  We're going to dig you out of those holes.
[01:25:33.895 --> 01:25:34.916]  You make us eat up.
[01:25:34.916 --> 01:25:36.858]  Let me tell you something right now.
[01:25:36.858 --> 01:25:40.803]  I swear to God, if it's the last thing I do, I'm going to get my hands around your throat.
[01:25:40.803 --> 01:25:43.285]  And you know that's why you're begging for peace right now.
[01:25:44.236 --> 01:25:48.220]  You should have thought about that when you turned down Christ a long time ago.
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:50.522]  You want to meet with me, you Satanist?
[01:25:50.522 --> 01:25:51.302]  Meet with me?
[01:25:51.302 --> 01:25:53.184]  How about you get on your knees to Christ?
[01:25:53.184 --> 01:25:55.566]  You'd meet with my boss right now!
[01:25:55.566 --> 01:25:56.807]  But you can't do it.
[01:25:56.807 --> 01:25:59.990]  You think you can meet with some low-level nobody?
[01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:03.032]  I'm nobody!
[01:26:03.032 --> 01:26:04.614]  You think Christ would eat somebody?
[01:26:04.614 --> 01:26:05.855]  He would never do that.
[01:26:05.855 --> 01:26:06.855]  I will.
[01:26:06.855 --> 01:26:08.517]  I'm not gonna watch my daughter starve to death.
[01:26:12.079 --> 01:26:15.880]  Now, you could say that was a metaphysical hypothetical, but it's really not.
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:22.582]  And let's just get past the jokes here.
[01:26:22.582 --> 01:26:34.585]  Every actuary and government study from South Africa, the United States, to Germany, to Russia, to Japan, to South America, shows in about seven days, almost everyone commits murder for food.
[01:26:34.585 --> 01:26:38.366]  Within 14 days, almost everyone resorts to cannibalism or commits suicide.
[01:26:39.946 --> 01:26:47.069]  Now, I would commit suicide before I did that, but my children are my weak place.
[01:26:47.069 --> 01:26:49.311]  I'll barbecue yo ass.
[01:26:49.311 --> 01:26:51.091]  Flat.
[01:26:51.091 --> 01:26:53.332]  I will eat you.
[01:26:53.332 --> 01:26:58.295]  So all you spirit cookers act all tough all day, how you're doing your little satanic rituals, drinking blood and stuff.
[01:26:59.454 --> 01:27:02.136]  I'll drink your blood, you understand that?
[01:27:02.136 --> 01:27:11.901]  I will hang your ass up and cut you into cutlets like a filet mignon and grill your ass before I watch my daughter starve to death.
[01:27:11.901 --> 01:27:17.264]  See now, you took society and civilization as if it was some joke you could piss on all day.
[01:27:17.264 --> 01:27:20.846]  Dude, you understand, you unleash the animal.
[01:27:20.846 --> 01:27:24.648]  You unleash the beast, and you're not the beast.
[01:27:24.648 --> 01:27:27.450]  I don't claim I'm the most tough guy around, but compared to you,
[01:27:28.888 --> 01:27:34.994]  Compared to you, I'm Godzilla on steroids.
[01:27:34.994 --> 01:27:38.758]  But just for the courts and everything, I'm joking around here.
[01:27:38.758 --> 01:27:39.840]  I'm not going to eat anybody.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:43.944]  Because like I said, if it came down to me alone, I'd starve to death before I did it.
[01:27:45.452 --> 01:27:51.996]  When my babies come into the equation, I will cook your ass up so fast that I'll tell them, oh, I killed a cow out back, baby.
[01:27:51.996 --> 01:27:56.679]  Here it is, because my babies ain't going to die for your crap, your failure.
[01:27:56.679 --> 01:28:01.363]  I will eat your leftist ass like corn on the cob!
[01:28:01.363 --> 01:28:03.504]  I'm ready!
[01:28:03.504 --> 01:28:04.885]  You want to worship Satan?
[01:28:04.885 --> 01:28:06.426]  Well, guess what?
[01:28:06.426 --> 01:28:09.228]  You're about to meet something worse, you dumb sacks of crap.
[01:28:10.697 --> 01:28:15.940]  You've been pissing on civilization your whole life, not knowing it's men held it up.
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:22.563]  It was savages held it up, because we knew how bad we were, and we didn't want you to let us loose.
[01:28:22.563 --> 01:28:29.426]  But now, you demand we pull the fist out, and just shove it into your teeth.
[01:28:29.426 --> 01:28:31.647]  So good!
[01:28:31.647 --> 01:28:39.891]  Before I'll sit there and live off starving Latin Americans and Africans, I swear before God, I'll eat one of these globalists on a spit.
[01:28:41.770 --> 01:28:45.215]  Oh, I'm a performance artist, like they say.
[01:28:45.215 --> 01:28:46.577]  Alex Jones is real.
[01:28:46.577 --> 01:28:47.999]  Everybody knows.
[01:28:47.999 --> 01:28:49.801]  I'm as fake as they come.
[01:28:49.801 --> 01:28:50.822]  Your calls are straight ahead.
[01:28:55.933 --> 01:28:57.154]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[01:28:57.154 --> 01:29:01.075]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[01:29:01.075 --> 01:29:02.616]  I sued the IRS and won.
[01:29:02.616 --> 01:29:05.577]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[01:29:05.577 --> 01:29:11.139]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[01:29:11.139 --> 01:29:12.340]  I can help you, too.
[01:29:12.340 --> 01:29:15.281]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[01:29:15.281 --> 01:29:17.502]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[01:29:17.502 --> 01:29:21.944]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[01:29:21.944 --> 01:29:24.245]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[01:29:25.828 --> 01:29:27.089]  Maybe not today.
[01:29:27.089 --> 01:29:28.369]  Maybe not tomorrow.
[01:29:28.369 --> 01:29:32.112]  But soon, you'll need a plan and place to survive.
[01:29:32.112 --> 01:29:33.192]  Forget bunkers.
[01:29:33.192 --> 01:29:35.013]  You're not a live underground gopher.
[01:29:35.013 --> 01:29:36.734]  You need Survivalist Camps.
[01:29:36.734 --> 01:29:44.518]  The ultimate, fully functional, off-the-grid, mobile survival bug-out house that's well-equipped and custom-built to outlast any other RV or trailer.
[01:29:44.518 --> 01:29:45.539]  Bold statement?
[01:29:45.539 --> 01:29:46.519]  You bet.
[01:29:46.519 --> 01:29:49.021]  See them now at survivalistcamps.com.
[01:29:49.021 --> 01:29:51.222]  That's survivalistcamps.com.
[01:29:51.222 --> 01:29:54.004]  Trust your family's survival to survivalistcamps.com.
[01:29:57.918 --> 01:30:04.060]  Well, Communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy use by half.
[01:30:04.060 --> 01:30:06.301]  And the United States wouldn't sign on to it.
[01:30:06.301 --> 01:30:07.461]  So guess what happened?
[01:30:07.461 --> 01:30:14.543]  Along came COVID-19, and Bill Gates is celebrating, saying it's already cut your carbon footprint by half.
[01:30:14.543 --> 01:30:17.904]  And that means you're going to be poor now, and under his control.
[01:30:17.904 --> 01:30:25.407]  And of course, with the medical tyranny comes the forced inoculations, a eek microchip that comes with the vaccine, and so much more.
[01:30:26.007 --> 01:30:30.410]  Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it.
[01:30:56.187 --> 01:30:58.709]  We're good to go.
[01:31:24.083 --> 01:31:25.604]  We're good to go.
[01:31:57.068 --> 01:31:58.889]  How do you put a people under house arrest?
[01:31:58.889 --> 01:32:00.891]  How do you put them under siege?
[01:32:00.891 --> 01:32:14.619]  Well, you tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up with the globalist Deep State and then had China release to then take down the populist president and those pesky American people that have become too uppity.
[01:32:15.419 --> 01:32:16.740]  Bill Maher even admitted it.
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:18.620]  Man, I hope we have a depression.
[01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:33.126]  And now they've tailored the whole thing, where the big corporations and the media are going to keep the country closed, along with the help of the blue cities and blue states, all the time blaming Trump and capitalism and Americanism for the depression it creates.
[01:32:33.946 --> 01:32:36.948]  If America is that stupid, we deserve what happens to us.
[01:32:36.948 --> 01:32:40.330]  But as for me, I'm not sitting here and I'm not taking it.
[01:32:40.330 --> 01:32:45.193]  It's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the good people keeping everybody safe.
[01:32:45.193 --> 01:32:46.854]  But that's not what they're doing.
[01:32:46.854 --> 01:32:59.301]  They are pulling America up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings, our health, our whole world, and committing millions of third world people to death.
[01:32:59.301 --> 01:33:01.923]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:12.557 --> 01:33:20.365]  When a log, when a yule, crank it up, it's put on the fire.
[01:33:20.365 --> 01:33:24.770]  It pops and sputters and talks.
[01:33:24.770 --> 01:33:31.217]  So while I'm sitting here, acting like I'm having a good time, it's because I'm dying.
[01:33:33.311 --> 01:33:34.752]  But I'm dying to be with you.
[01:33:34.752 --> 01:33:42.656]  And I've already done a lot of work behind the scenes to make sure we go into the future for a long time.
[01:33:42.656 --> 01:33:45.258]  Listen to this.
[01:33:45.258 --> 01:33:47.919]  Everything's gonna be easy.
[01:33:47.919 --> 01:33:48.559]  Crank it up.
[01:33:48.559 --> 01:33:48.920]  One time.
[01:33:48.920 --> 01:33:49.680]  Killed by death!
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:57.164]  Gotta stop fearing death.
[01:33:57.164 --> 01:33:58.385]  Killed by death, my friends.
[01:34:02.205 --> 01:34:03.366]  Motorhead, man.
[01:34:03.366 --> 01:34:11.990]  You talk about some music right there.
[01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:28.219]  Let me tell you, if you study the algorithms of finance and life and business,
[01:34:29.398 --> 01:34:34.229]  It took hundreds of years to build this infrastructure.
[01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:36.314]  It's been misused and we've been decadent.
[01:34:38.177 --> 01:34:51.365]  All that's true, but hundreds of years of work and infrastructures is being like a building being demolished, brought down right in front of us.
[01:34:51.365 --> 01:34:58.329]  And I sit back and I watch the UN now admit 133 million people are going to starve to death in the next year.
[01:34:58.329 --> 01:34:59.470]  It was 30 million a week ago.
[01:35:00.905 --> 01:35:04.126]  And I agree with those numbers, by the way, because I know how tenuous it is.
[01:35:04.126 --> 01:35:15.569]  And, man, when I'm sitting there at dinner, like, eating a steak or a potato that I just grilled... I don't say this to be some goody-two-shoe virtue signaler.
[01:35:15.569 --> 01:35:20.370]  I, uh... I can't even eat, like, super good food anymore.
[01:35:20.370 --> 01:35:22.071]  It's not some leftist thing, either.
[01:35:22.071 --> 01:35:27.112]  It's like, I'm like... People are starving to death, and I'm sitting here eating a filet mignon.
[01:35:31.121 --> 01:35:32.742]  Because what's the sacrifice supposed to be?
[01:35:32.742 --> 01:35:39.025]  Like, the left is killing all these people and it ruins my dinner!
[01:35:39.025 --> 01:35:41.366]  That could seem silly.
[01:35:41.366 --> 01:35:42.746]  But yeah, there's the story from last week.
[01:35:42.746 --> 01:35:48.029]  It's now 133 million starving to death.
[01:35:48.029 --> 01:35:50.570]  And if you know Third World, that's a very conservative number.
[01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:55.132]  Like I told you, I could have done the whole show today off this one article.
[01:35:55.132 --> 01:35:57.613]  Internet speech will never go back to normal from the Atlantic.
[01:36:01.314 --> 01:36:13.640]  And it says right here in this article that China's good and you deserve what's about to happen to you.
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:17.641]  Alright, let's just go to your calls.
[01:36:17.641 --> 01:36:20.563]  This is just unbelievably sick.
[01:36:20.563 --> 01:36:22.303]  Why don't we educate the third world?
[01:36:22.303 --> 01:36:23.124]  Why don't we build that?
[01:36:24.376 --> 01:36:25.818]  I've read the actuaries on that.
[01:36:25.818 --> 01:36:26.498]  You could do it.
[01:36:26.498 --> 01:36:30.802]  No, we're just going to starve them to death because it makes these people feel good.
[01:36:30.802 --> 01:36:38.809]  While they use giant third world hordes of men who want a future to come drive us down and drive down our wages.
[01:36:38.809 --> 01:36:45.014]  Just because the third world's a bunch of brainwashed people who are under globalist control.
[01:36:45.014 --> 01:36:49.638]  If I was locked up in some third world country and a man, I'd be like, I'm getting to a country that's going to give me some freedom.
[01:36:51.820 --> 01:36:55.402]  But see, they're still an enemy, because they've been programmed.
[01:36:55.402 --> 01:37:03.487]  People go, why are you for the third world, but you want to block them from coming in, because I want to make their country successful.
[01:37:03.487 --> 01:37:05.208]  There's the paradox.
[01:37:05.208 --> 01:37:08.790]  The left's like, oh, let these people in, oh yeah.
[01:37:08.790 --> 01:37:11.151]  They've been brought in, they're all weaponized against the country.
[01:37:11.151 --> 01:37:13.372]  Let's just go to your calls.
[01:37:13.372 --> 01:37:16.454]  Jesus.
[01:37:16.454 --> 01:37:17.695]  There's not much time to fix this.
[01:37:19.696 --> 01:37:21.657]  I've warned everybody.
[01:37:21.657 --> 01:37:27.598]  I'm going to have to go into a selfish mode soon.
[01:37:27.598 --> 01:37:39.941]  I feel guilty every time I'm around my children that I'm not building some armored redoubt because the globalists are building armored fortresses because they know what they've done.
[01:37:39.941 --> 01:37:42.002]  There's a genetic selfishness.
[01:37:45.282 --> 01:37:48.505]  Where I'm just like constantly like I have dreams about in a way.
[01:37:48.505 --> 01:37:49.225]  Just run!
[01:37:49.225 --> 01:37:49.466]  Run!
[01:37:49.466 --> 01:37:50.947]  Go to Northern Canada!
[01:37:50.947 --> 01:37:51.988]  Just get out Jones!
[01:37:51.988 --> 01:37:53.109]  Get out now!
[01:37:53.109 --> 01:37:55.831]  Because you would say I love my children.
[01:37:55.831 --> 01:37:56.431]  Yeah, you're right.
[01:37:56.431 --> 01:37:56.992]  Son's off.
[01:37:56.992 --> 01:37:58.073]  My son's great.
[01:37:58.073 --> 01:37:58.994]  But I'm just he's a son.
[01:37:58.994 --> 01:38:00.275]  I don't even worry about it.
[01:38:00.275 --> 01:38:02.837]  But my daughters, I have nightmares about my daughters.
[01:38:02.837 --> 01:38:05.019]  I just constantly worry about them.
[01:38:05.019 --> 01:38:10.503]  And and I just I've tried to save the whole thing and you tried to save it.
[01:38:10.503 --> 01:38:12.004]  I don't know if we can save any of it folks.
[01:38:12.004 --> 01:38:12.565]  I gotta tell you.
[01:38:15.751 --> 01:38:21.075]  And then God tells me, how many kids did you kill, Jones?
[01:38:21.075 --> 01:38:26.420]  You probably killed 15, 20 kids you knew of back before you had Jesus.
[01:38:26.420 --> 01:38:32.985]  And so now, you know, that comes back on the ones that made it, son.
[01:38:32.985 --> 01:38:35.707]  Because I know when I die, spirits are real.
[01:38:35.707 --> 01:38:36.948]  I'm going to have to sit there.
[01:38:36.948 --> 01:38:39.651]  I can't wait, actually, to meet these incredible people.
[01:38:39.651 --> 01:38:44.775]  I mean, I would.
[01:38:47.918 --> 01:38:51.321]  Be tortured for a thousand years for one of the children I know.
[01:38:51.321 --> 01:38:54.544]  I would do anything for them.
[01:38:54.544 --> 01:39:00.269]  And I can't imagine the children that I supported being chopped up and butchered.
[01:39:00.269 --> 01:39:05.293]  That I never knew that I destroyed all that wealth, all that power, everything.
[01:39:05.293 --> 01:39:12.259]  And instead the left makes a sick joke out of it.
[01:39:12.259 --> 01:39:13.460]  Killing their own children.
[01:39:21.175 --> 01:39:23.656]  Not knowing how the universe works.
[01:39:23.656 --> 01:39:29.059]  You think you kill your children and you don't get destroyed?
[01:39:29.059 --> 01:39:37.223]  You think you let some doctor vacuum out your child's brain or chop your daughter or son up and that you don't then die?
[01:39:37.223 --> 01:39:40.784]  I mean, just think about how the universe works.
[01:39:40.784 --> 01:39:44.746]  You never get away with sin.
[01:39:44.746 --> 01:39:45.787]  Because you reap what you sow.
[01:39:48.188 --> 01:39:49.749]  And what comes around goes around.
[01:39:49.749 --> 01:40:03.554]  And I just think about people so cut off from God that they make jokes about how they had an orgasm while their daughter's brain was vacuumed out.
[01:40:03.554 --> 01:40:10.357]  I look at that person and I say, you're going to experience eternity without God.
[01:40:11.906 --> 01:40:14.187]  And that's a cold place to be.
[01:40:14.187 --> 01:40:17.890]  And I've ran it too much, so let's not talk about what I said the other day.
[01:40:17.890 --> 01:40:20.611]  But this is the time to get real.
[01:40:20.611 --> 01:40:23.453]  This is the time to cut the crap, folks.
[01:40:23.453 --> 01:40:27.836]  And get right down to who you are and what you stand for forever.
[01:40:27.836 --> 01:40:30.377]  Because that's all that ever matters.
[01:40:30.377 --> 01:40:32.999]  Joe in New Jersey, go ahead and take us out of this segment.
[01:40:32.999 --> 01:40:35.541]  Sorry for making you all... Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:40:35.541 --> 01:40:40.744]  I just wanted to say that I think a way that we could get around this is
[01:40:41.431 --> 01:40:43.292]  You know, we don't have a real infrastructure.
[01:40:43.292 --> 01:40:45.332]  You know, Twitter shuts us down.
[01:40:45.332 --> 01:40:46.652]  YouTube shuts us down.
[01:40:46.652 --> 01:40:48.013]  No, that's why they want InfoWars.
[01:40:48.013 --> 01:40:50.634]  It's a little pathetic infrastructure.
[01:40:50.634 --> 01:40:51.754]  Humanity has nothing.
[01:40:51.754 --> 01:40:52.854]  The babies have nothing.
[01:40:52.854 --> 01:40:53.814]  We have nothing.
[01:40:53.814 --> 01:40:54.715]  We're just nothing.
[01:40:54.715 --> 01:40:56.495]  We don't get infrastructure.
[01:40:56.495 --> 01:40:59.596]  Only the satanic demons get infrastructure.
[01:40:59.596 --> 01:40:59.996]  That's right.
[01:40:59.996 --> 01:41:01.937]  And they built up these big box stores.
[01:41:01.937 --> 01:41:10.579]  And there's no real way for small businesses, no matter what industry they're in, to be able to connect in a good way.
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:12.640]  And that's where it needs to start.
[01:41:12.640 --> 01:41:25.465]  You know, there's a lot of people out there who do have great small business, who have a lot of money, they're looking to invest in talented people, talented ideas, and there's really no way to get people to connect like that because it's all drowned out by the big box.
[01:41:25.465 --> 01:41:26.085]  You know?
[01:41:26.085 --> 01:41:26.665]  Exactly.
[01:41:26.665 --> 01:41:28.446]  So people should deny the big box.
[01:41:29.806 --> 01:41:32.427]  Like big box is pedophilia, big box is satanism.
[01:41:32.427 --> 01:41:38.450]  And we all do it because we're in a town, we need to go buy ammo, we need to buy diapers, we need to go buy orange juice, we go there.
[01:41:38.450 --> 01:41:40.711]  We have to realize, no, I can't go there.
[01:41:40.711 --> 01:41:48.075]  I have to buy, the biggest business would be like some symbol, I'm pro-human, I'm low level, like I'm little.
[01:41:48.775 --> 01:41:50.697]  Like a little symbol, like I'm a little.
[01:41:50.697 --> 01:41:53.079]  We need to like, I'm micro, I'm local.
[01:41:53.079 --> 01:41:55.982]  We need to, and it needs to be micro, it needs to be local.
[01:41:55.982 --> 01:41:58.984]  Local is king, because local is close to humanity.
[01:41:58.984 --> 01:42:00.326]  What do you think?
[01:42:00.326 --> 01:42:00.906]  No, that's great.
[01:42:00.906 --> 01:42:03.348]  You know, just like everybody has their symbol.
[01:42:03.348 --> 01:42:05.130]  You know, we have our own symbol.
[01:42:05.130 --> 01:42:06.031]  We're united by
[01:42:06.638 --> 01:42:09.781]  Whatever that little symbol is, and say, I go there and shop.
[01:42:09.781 --> 01:42:10.721]  I do business with them.
[01:42:10.721 --> 01:42:12.783]  And that's what they're afraid of.
[01:42:12.783 --> 01:42:17.267]  And here's the thing, they knew we were already, we're already, everyone's rushing out of the cities.
[01:42:17.267 --> 01:42:19.809]  Everyone's, that's why they did this, is they're losing.
[01:42:19.809 --> 01:42:25.973]  They had this big, beautiful plan, but let me tell you, as the Bible says, but I'm even, without the Bible, I've seen the projection.
[01:42:25.973 --> 01:42:27.515]  It's exactly as Revelation says.
[01:42:29.969 --> 01:42:34.474]  They're gonna race and fight us and look like they'll overcome us right at the end.
[01:42:34.474 --> 01:42:36.496]  Just so Satan can be defeated.
[01:42:36.496 --> 01:42:39.099]  And then it just all ends instantly, my brother.
[01:42:39.099 --> 01:42:40.120]  I love you.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:40.681]  Beautiful call.
[01:42:40.681 --> 01:42:43.043]  Alright, I'll try not to take calls when I come back.
[01:42:43.043 --> 01:42:44.445]  I'm sorry, I've been out of control today.
[01:42:55.737 --> 01:43:01.183]  Ladies and gentlemen, Info Wars can now offer high-quality, affordable food again.
[01:43:01.183 --> 01:43:06.708]  Other manufacturers were sold out eight weeks ago, and they told people they had food.
[01:43:06.708 --> 01:43:08.530]  Most folks never delivered their food.
[01:43:08.530 --> 01:43:17.760]  Well, when our sponsors' food began to run short, they just suspended sales until they opened more factories and secured more food.
[01:43:18.180 --> 01:43:23.441]  So if you get your orders in right now, they can take new orders and get it to you quickly.
[01:43:23.441 --> 01:43:36.565]  They'll probably have to suspend orders very, very soon again because the lockdown of the economy is killing food distribution, farming, you name it, and now it's mainstream news that food shortages and delivery are already starting to happen.
[01:43:37.325 --> 01:43:44.027]  If Trump can turn the economy back on and wrest control of our system away from the globalists, things may be okay.
[01:43:44.027 --> 01:43:46.268]  But it looks like it's going to get very, very rough.
[01:43:46.268 --> 01:43:53.090]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to secure the number one thing you need, high-quality, storable food, ready to get to you and your family now.
[01:43:53.090 --> 01:43:55.931]  Get your orders in at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:43:55.931 --> 01:43:58.292]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[01:43:58.292 --> 01:43:58.872]  They're amazing.
[01:43:58.872 --> 01:43:59.553]  They're cutting edge.
[01:43:59.553 --> 01:44:00.633]  You love them, I love them.
[01:44:00.633 --> 01:44:03.394]  And they fund the InfoWar in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[01:44:04.266 --> 01:44:11.029]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development that is amazing.
[01:44:11.029 --> 01:44:18.692]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[01:44:18.692 --> 01:44:21.013]  And there's another innovation.
[01:44:21.013 --> 01:44:23.094]  It's the spray cap.
[01:44:23.094 --> 01:44:28.516]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality.
[01:44:28.516 --> 01:44:30.697]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[01:44:30.697 --> 01:44:31.598]  I like to put it on my hands.
[01:44:32.338 --> 01:44:33.839]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[01:44:33.839 --> 01:44:36.662]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so spray it right in your eyes.
[01:44:36.662 --> 01:44:41.065]  But I just love it, personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[01:44:41.065 --> 01:44:42.867]  So, this is a real innovation.
[01:44:42.867 --> 01:44:49.192]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out.
[01:44:49.192 --> 01:44:50.734]  It smells great.
[01:44:50.734 --> 01:44:52.555]  It's so refreshing.
[01:44:52.555 --> 01:44:58.900]  This is a big winner.
[01:44:58.900 --> 01:45:00.402]  What are champions made of?
[01:45:02.274 --> 01:45:03.388]  Here's a man who can show you.
[01:45:09.955 --> 01:45:11.476]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store hotline!
[01:45:11.476 --> 01:45:13.036]  AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store hotline!
[01:45:13.036 --> 01:45:14.397]  AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store hotline!
[01:45:14.397 --> 01:45:16.317]  AAA-253-3139, is the InfoWars store hotline!
[01:45:36.164 --> 01:45:39.627]  InfoWarsStore.com is simply the best.
[01:45:39.627 --> 01:45:41.268]  InfoWarsStore.com beats out all the rest.
[01:45:41.268 --> 01:45:43.230]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139 is the InfoWars Store Online.
[01:45:43.230 --> 01:45:44.391]  888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, 888-253-3139, that's InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:45:44.391 --> 01:45:47.053]  When one studies history and human nature, you learn very quickly that
[01:46:03.291 --> 01:46:24.891]  Rugged individualism and people that think for themselves, build free societies, innovate, do amazing things, but those that love to grovel, those that love to be subservient, those that love to comply and think that it's a virtue, they create stagnation, corruption, tyranny, and then finally collapse.
[01:46:24.891 --> 01:46:27.513]  And the world is now being tested.
[01:46:28.584 --> 01:46:40.406]  And we're seeing lots of dutiful individuals who've complied and submitted their whole lives believing if they just submit now in a bigger way, somehow they'll create a heavenly future.
[01:46:40.406 --> 01:46:50.688]  But the technocrats running the global system are oppressive and anti-human and are psychotic and are building an anti-human future.
[01:46:50.688 --> 01:46:55.769]  Submission to them is like tying a big boulder around your neck and throwing it into the ocean.
[01:47:00.296 --> 01:47:02.919]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:26.801 --> 01:47:28.943]  Apprentices.
[01:47:28.943 --> 01:47:32.406]  He does his own thing now.
[01:47:32.406 --> 01:47:35.929]  That's the thing about apprentices or children.
[01:47:35.929 --> 01:47:38.211]  They do their own things.
[01:47:38.211 --> 01:47:42.514]  But long after you're gone, they come back.
[01:47:42.514 --> 01:47:44.936]  I got a plan.
[01:47:44.936 --> 01:47:46.938]  Takes over the next hour.
[01:47:46.938 --> 01:47:48.679]  Let's go to Rick in Pennsylvania.
[01:47:48.679 --> 01:47:49.600]  You're on the air, Rick.
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:51.802]  Go ahead.
[01:47:51.802 --> 01:47:52.142]  Hi, Alex.
[01:47:52.142 --> 01:47:53.863]  Great to talk to you.
[01:47:53.863 --> 01:47:55.245]  I watched your piece about
[01:47:56.536 --> 01:48:03.062]  The farmers plowing under their crops and killing their livestock.
[01:48:03.062 --> 01:48:07.186]  And I was just wondering if they were told to do that by the government.
[01:48:07.186 --> 01:48:13.913]  I mean, why would they do something like that in a food crisis and who has the power to make them do that?
[01:48:13.913 --> 01:48:14.553]  It's the money.
[01:48:14.553 --> 01:48:15.635]  So let me break it down.
[01:48:17.523 --> 01:48:26.113]  We could spend a thousand hours on this because this is farming and we've got a family farm and a ranch still and we're barely involved and it doesn't make money but I know about it.
[01:48:26.113 --> 01:48:34.444]  So when you got feed animals that have been raised on the land, they're put in a feeder, you put all this money into them and then Cargill and
[01:48:37.318 --> 01:48:39.939]  Tyson and the other ones.
[01:48:39.939 --> 01:48:41.260]  There's only like four big ones now.
[01:48:41.260 --> 01:48:42.741]  They consolidated in the last 20 years.
[01:48:42.741 --> 01:48:45.002]  There used to be hundreds of meatpackers.
[01:48:45.002 --> 01:48:46.683]  There's only like four right now.
[01:48:46.683 --> 01:48:50.525]  Once they do that, you're sitting there with prime beef.
[01:48:50.525 --> 01:48:53.627]  This cow's worth like $20,000.
[01:48:53.627 --> 01:48:57.309]  But they won't take it.
[01:48:57.309 --> 01:49:02.072]  So Trump, when he signed off on stimulus, thought he was sending money to the average person.
[01:49:02.072 --> 01:49:03.313]  But it's actually a check.
[01:49:04.383 --> 01:49:10.141]  That then goes to the ranch or the farm to destroy it or...
[01:49:11.488 --> 01:49:12.548]  Take dairy cows.
[01:49:12.548 --> 01:49:15.569]  I'm sure you know this, but they fill up two or three times a day.
[01:49:15.569 --> 01:49:16.729]  They're Jersey cows.
[01:49:16.729 --> 01:49:17.829]  They're Holsteins.
[01:49:17.829 --> 01:49:19.749]  They're bred to do this.
[01:49:19.749 --> 01:49:20.290]  Okay.
[01:49:20.290 --> 01:49:22.330]  And so you have to off-pump the milk.
[01:49:22.330 --> 01:49:26.771]  Well, there's no trucks to get it or stores to pick it up because of the lockdown.
[01:49:26.771 --> 01:49:32.392]  They have to dump the, they have to show it in a video to the federal government to get their money back.
[01:49:32.392 --> 01:49:36.912]  So the government creates the artificial atmosphere where they've got to do these things.
[01:49:36.912 --> 01:49:39.433]  And then exactly China and Argentina and
[01:49:40.333 --> 01:49:46.807]  You know, all these countries, they don't have restrictions, so they're all shipping the media in while we're under the restrictions.
[01:49:46.807 --> 01:49:48.109]  So yeah, it's a huge global scoop.
[01:49:48.948 --> 01:49:58.712]  One would think with all the resources and power of the federal government that they would be able to marshal whatever they need to truck this process.
[01:49:58.712 --> 01:50:04.635]  Man, they're too busy making sure somebody doesn't say that coital silver might kill bacteria.
[01:50:04.635 --> 01:50:10.758]  I mean, seriously, the federal government is like the most beam-counting slaves you could ever imagine.
[01:50:11.098 --> 01:50:12.098]  I mean, I hear you.
[01:50:12.098 --> 01:50:13.019]  They don't even know that.
[01:50:13.019 --> 01:50:17.380]  They're like, you think the FBI cares that China's shipping in all this beef?
[01:50:17.380 --> 01:50:18.000]  No.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:24.543]  They just, as a bureaucrat, if they can piss on a farmer and make him follow things, they feel like they're doing their job.
[01:50:24.543 --> 01:50:26.003]  They only think of America.
[01:50:26.003 --> 01:50:30.465]  So they've been regulatorily given authority to piss on America, so they do it.
[01:50:30.996 --> 01:50:34.358]  It seems to me like the federal government should take more control.
[01:50:34.358 --> 01:50:35.539]  I mean, they have the power.
[01:50:35.539 --> 01:50:36.160]  Yeah, I know.
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:40.643]  Trump has the power, and I like Trump, but it just shows he doesn't have the knowledge.
[01:50:40.643 --> 01:50:43.785]  I don't see how you can study him like other people have.
[01:50:43.785 --> 01:50:45.806]  No, you're absolutely right, Rick.
[01:50:45.806 --> 01:50:47.708]  This is a frickin' fiasco.
[01:50:47.708 --> 01:50:48.148]  God bless you.
[01:50:50.493 --> 01:50:51.313]  Get ready, folks.
[01:50:51.313 --> 01:50:51.893]  I told you.
[01:50:51.893 --> 01:50:56.914]  I mean, this is a... Look, the microchip and the forced inoculations is all gravy.
[01:50:56.914 --> 01:50:57.655]  And gravy's great.
[01:50:57.655 --> 01:50:59.275]  I got a chicken fried steak.
[01:50:59.275 --> 01:51:00.795]  I want that steak.
[01:51:00.795 --> 01:51:01.535]  I got broccoli.
[01:51:01.535 --> 01:51:02.335]  I got potatoes.
[01:51:02.335 --> 01:51:03.636]  I got carrots.
[01:51:03.636 --> 01:51:05.996]  I got, you know, side dishes.
[01:51:05.996 --> 01:51:07.557]  The gravy's fun, though.
[01:51:07.557 --> 01:51:09.957]  You know, I like the gravy.
[01:51:09.957 --> 01:51:15.378]  It's gravy to shut down America.
[01:51:15.378 --> 01:51:19.379]  It's steak to turn off the third world and kill hundreds of millions.
[01:51:21.098 --> 01:51:25.779]  And that's happening now.
[01:51:25.779 --> 01:51:36.701]  And so as nationalists, as Christians, as conservatives, as evil white men, we need to come out and say, uh, it's wrong to starve Africans and Latin Americans and Asians to death.
[01:51:36.701 --> 01:51:38.221]  We don't support that.
[01:51:38.221 --> 01:51:40.381]  And it's Trump's total Trump card.
[01:51:40.381 --> 01:51:46.302]  I mean, Trump just comes out and goes, the UN says 133 million are starving to death right now.
[01:51:46.302 --> 01:51:48.523]  You're racist if you don't stop this.
[01:51:48.523 --> 01:51:49.563]  It all ends.
[01:51:51.010 --> 01:52:01.819]  And I advised the president on this last week, and I advised him on it this morning through multiple sources, and they are, the response was, we're gonna kill your ass.
[01:52:01.819 --> 01:52:03.120]  I'm like, okay, great.
[01:52:03.120 --> 01:52:08.064]  Dude, I can't, I mean, imagine all those babies in Africa and Latin America.
[01:52:08.064 --> 01:52:10.586]  You could say overpopulated, not overpopulated.
[01:52:10.586 --> 01:52:12.348]  Are you gonna pull the trigger and blow their heads off?
[01:52:13.131 --> 01:52:14.852]  When little kids begging for food and dying.
[01:52:14.852 --> 01:52:16.113]  I mean, just come on, man.
[01:52:16.113 --> 01:52:17.614]  We're not doing this.
[01:52:17.614 --> 01:52:19.676]  It's not in my DNA.
[01:52:19.676 --> 01:52:21.537]  And that's the real world.
[01:52:21.537 --> 01:52:23.899]  Pull up the articles like APS fake.
[01:52:23.899 --> 01:52:26.661]  133 million people starving now.
[01:52:26.661 --> 01:52:27.782]  It was 33 million last week.
[01:52:33.439 --> 01:52:38.021]  There's not a million dead worldwide from this virus, but millions are dying.
[01:52:38.021 --> 01:52:41.282]  Why do we?
[01:52:41.282 --> 01:52:43.323]  Oh, 265 million are starving.
[01:52:43.323 --> 01:52:45.284]  Sorry, it's gone up.
[01:52:45.284 --> 01:52:51.166]  And in the very UN that's running all this is like grabbing money.
[01:52:51.166 --> 01:52:56.548]  You think when you stand before God, and believe me, you will, folks, you don't just take DMT and stand before demons.
[01:52:56.548 --> 01:52:58.109]  You die, you stand before God.
[01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:59.890]  You walk in there, the judge is right there.
[01:53:01.155 --> 01:53:02.535]  Mr. Jones, it's a pleasure to speak with you.
[01:53:02.535 --> 01:53:05.016]  I'm just wondering, do you think we're going to survive the tyranny?
[01:53:31.578 --> 01:53:34.699]  No, we're gonna die.
[01:53:34.699 --> 01:53:38.600]  Well, me and my buddy... But our spirits, brother, live on.
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:40.800]  So what matters is our consciousness.
[01:53:40.800 --> 01:53:42.821]  Hold on to that.
[01:53:42.821 --> 01:53:46.302]  You ever been out in the ocean and sucked under by a rip current?
[01:53:46.302 --> 01:53:47.202]  You're lucky if you haven't.
[01:53:47.202 --> 01:53:47.862]  I have a few.
[01:53:47.862 --> 01:53:51.223]  You ever been sucked under by a rip current?
[01:53:51.223 --> 01:53:52.764]  Oh yeah, plenty of times.
[01:53:52.764 --> 01:53:54.624]  Are you a surfer?
[01:53:54.624 --> 01:53:58.365]  No, I've just been to Florida many a times in my life.
[01:53:58.365 --> 01:53:58.925]  And what do you do?
[01:53:58.925 --> 01:54:00.806]  You turn loose and you pop back up, don't you?
[01:54:01.866 --> 01:54:02.567]  Oh yeah.
[01:54:02.567 --> 01:54:06.211]  So you're asking me the question is... Well, let's start over.
[01:54:06.211 --> 01:54:08.693]  I'm going to stop talking.
[01:54:08.693 --> 01:54:10.615]  Go ahead.
[01:54:10.615 --> 01:54:12.557]  So, me and my buddy, he just got an AR.
[01:54:12.557 --> 01:54:17.943]  We're ready to protest Whitmer again on the 30th.
[01:54:17.943 --> 01:54:19.725]  That's beautiful.
[01:54:19.725 --> 01:54:21.647]  Yes, will we survive this tyranny?
[01:54:21.647 --> 01:54:22.328]  Your spirit
[01:54:24.201 --> 01:54:36.668]  Totally survives, but your spirit has free will so you have to point it the way you want to go and I'm not telling you something you don't know, Hunter.
[01:54:36.668 --> 01:54:39.390]  Which way is your soul pointed, Hunter?
[01:54:39.390 --> 01:54:40.610]  Towards the Lord.
[01:54:40.610 --> 01:54:42.711]  Damn right, brother.
[01:54:42.711 --> 01:54:43.492]  Mine is too.
[01:54:43.492 --> 01:54:46.293]  And I got another question for you.
[01:54:46.293 --> 01:54:50.456]  I haven't really heard you talk about it really that much in the past three years.
[01:54:50.456 --> 01:54:52.337]  Why the hell did Willie Nelson support Beto?
[01:54:54.217 --> 01:55:06.892]  Willie Nelson, who I've known for 20 years, until about 10 years ago, was super smart.
[01:55:06.892 --> 01:55:12.598]  And Willie Nelson came to my in-game event, I've hung out with him in his house many times, and then by the time he hit about 80, man,
[01:55:19.002 --> 01:55:19.342]  I don't know.
[01:55:36.716 --> 01:55:42.040]  And if I smoked half as much pot and drank as half as much alcohol, I'd be dead at 46.
[01:55:42.040 --> 01:55:45.423]  So that's the truth is Willie Nelson ain't there.
[01:55:45.423 --> 01:55:53.168]  It's kind of like they rolled out Charlton Heston like six months before he died to say I'm not for the NRA and you know I hate America and all this stuff.
[01:55:53.168 --> 01:55:54.650]  That was his senile wife with him.
[01:55:55.387 --> 01:55:56.748]  That's not Charlton Heston.
[01:55:56.748 --> 01:55:59.449]  They could roll me out when I'm 80-something and not knowing who I am.
[01:55:59.449 --> 01:56:00.850]  I hate America!
[01:56:00.850 --> 01:56:03.212]  I mean, this is not me, man.
[01:56:03.212 --> 01:56:04.352]  This is me, right now.
[01:56:04.352 --> 01:56:06.474]  This is who I am, just like you, brother.
[01:56:06.474 --> 01:56:07.835]  So, I don't blame Willie Nelson.
[01:56:07.835 --> 01:56:15.339]  I had dinner with Willie Nelson six years ago, seven years ago.
[01:56:15.339 --> 01:56:18.781]  Dave Mustaine was in town, and he goes, I want to meet Willie Nelson.
[01:56:18.781 --> 01:56:19.742]  I went, well, I got his number.
[01:56:19.742 --> 01:56:20.582]  Let me call him.
[01:56:20.582 --> 01:56:21.663]  Willie Nelson answers.
[01:56:21.663 --> 01:56:24.825]  I'm in the same area of West Austin, out in the hill country.
[01:56:26.001 --> 01:56:26.261]  I don't
[01:56:43.015 --> 01:56:45.637]  It was one of those non-gluten restaurants.
[01:56:45.637 --> 01:56:46.958]  It later closed.
[01:56:46.958 --> 01:56:48.619]  And so we go, we have dinner with him.
[01:56:48.619 --> 01:56:49.660]  Me, Willie, Dave Mustaine.
[01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:53.242]  You can Google, at least for now, Dave Mustaine, Alex Jones.
[01:56:53.242 --> 01:56:54.664]  When else did we have that last dinner with him?
[01:56:54.664 --> 01:56:56.045]  And man, he was drinking red wine.
[01:56:56.045 --> 01:56:58.246]  He was on Captain Kangaroo World.
[01:56:58.246 --> 01:56:58.807]  Yeah, there it is.
[01:56:58.807 --> 01:57:00.027]  They pulled it up.
[01:57:00.027 --> 01:57:04.691]  So that was seven years ago right before my divorce.
[01:57:04.691 --> 01:57:06.332]  That's a true story right there.
[01:57:06.332 --> 01:57:07.433]  So does that answer your question, buddy?
[01:57:08.792 --> 01:57:09.453]  Yes, it does.
[01:57:09.453 --> 01:57:10.173]  I got one more.
[01:57:10.173 --> 01:57:11.654]  How do you convince people?
[01:57:11.654 --> 01:57:13.416]  Because they're just so brainwashed.
[01:57:13.416 --> 01:57:16.278]  They're so dug into the liberals.
[01:57:16.278 --> 01:57:19.901]  It just seems like it's impossible.
[01:57:19.901 --> 01:57:25.205]  You know, a lot of people kind of plead with the people that are minions.
[01:57:25.205 --> 01:57:26.926]  I just say, hey, you want to be an idiot?
[01:57:26.926 --> 01:57:27.927]  Go ahead.
[01:57:27.927 --> 01:57:31.530]  And just give them facts and move on and say, here's one piece of info.
[01:57:31.530 --> 01:57:34.772]  And later, when you decide not to be a loser, you need to look at this information.
[01:57:34.772 --> 01:57:35.593]  Then you move on from there.
[01:57:36.670 --> 01:57:38.852]  All right, more phone calls straight ahead.
[01:57:38.852 --> 01:57:40.273]  Thank you, sir.
[01:57:40.273 --> 01:57:43.375]  Carlos, Sonny, Jeff, Mike, Brendan.
[01:57:45.751 --> 01:57:51.154]  One of the best nutrients nature has provided, beetroot, has been used for hundreds of years in natural medicine.

[01:58:20.013 --> 01:58:27.077]  The Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the Infowars crew use every day for the purest water possible.

[01:58:47.492 --> 01:58:53.895]  And all of a sudden, the trap snaps inside.
[01:58:53.895 --> 01:59:10.641]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years, going back to Magna Carta in 1215, of hard-fought basic human dignity and liberty, and believing that the individual was sovereign and had basic, unalienable rights, has been absolutely erased, just in March.
[01:59:10.641 --> 01:59:11.802]  And the Communist Chinese,
[01:59:13.470 --> 01:59:17.141]  And then our teachers, and Big Tech has been our controllers.
[01:59:17.141 --> 01:59:18.766]  We're all being introduced now.
[01:59:19.859 --> 01:59:29.321]  The digital straitjacket that depends on us complying with it, and depends on us all hen-pecking each other into submission.
[01:59:29.321 --> 01:59:38.724]  But for all of you out there that have decided to go along with this, mark your calendars down, and then in a few months, a few years, look at the world and remember, you did this.
[01:59:38.724 --> 01:59:44.285]  You were the prisoners, you were the slaves, you were the people that crouched down and licked the hand that fed you.
[01:59:44.285 --> 01:59:46.626]  Ask for me, give me liberty, or give me death.
[01:59:49.873 --> 01:59:52.515]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:17.102 --> 02:00:18.124]  Going public.
[02:00:18.124 --> 02:00:27.378]  It was in Idaho and New York and California and Mississippi and Texas and Michigan and just everywhere.
[02:00:27.378 --> 02:00:30.263]  And these two guys have a whole bunch of clinics across the state.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:35.783]  And they're well known, and they're telling you stuff you already know is true.
[02:00:35.783 --> 02:00:45.792]  96% of people in California who get COVID recover with almost no significant sequelae or no significant continuing medical problems.
[02:00:45.792 --> 02:00:48.035]  COVID-19 is one aspect of our health sector.
[02:00:48.855 --> 02:00:54.456]  What has it caused to have us be involved in social isolation?
[02:00:54.456 --> 02:00:54.897]  What is it?
[02:00:54.897 --> 02:00:59.138]  What is the cause that we are seeing the community respond to?
[02:00:59.138 --> 02:01:02.518]  Child molestation is increasing at a severe rate.
[02:01:02.518 --> 02:01:07.160]  We could go over multiple cases of children who have been molested due to angry
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:12.983]  Family members who are intoxicated, who are home, who have no paycheck.
[02:01:12.983 --> 02:01:14.765]  These things last a lifetime.
[02:01:14.765 --> 02:01:16.786]  This isn't about a seasonal flu.
[02:01:16.786 --> 02:01:22.030]  These are things that will follow these people and affect them in a negative fashion for their life.
[02:01:22.030 --> 02:01:24.252]  And these are secondary effects from COVID.
[02:01:24.252 --> 02:01:30.957]  And these are for me talking to ERs, talking to my doctors, and talking to people across the country and finding out what they're seeing.
[02:01:30.957 --> 02:01:31.657]  Spousal abuse.
[02:01:32.538 --> 02:01:36.021]  We see people coming in here with black eyes and cuts on their face.
[02:01:36.021 --> 02:01:37.922]  It's an obvious abuse of case.
[02:01:37.922 --> 02:01:42.205]  These are things that will affect them for a lifetime, not for a season.
[02:01:42.205 --> 02:01:45.568]  Alcoholism, anxiety, depression, suicide.
[02:01:45.568 --> 02:01:50.611]  I talked to the Donna Youngblood and various people in the community.
[02:01:50.611 --> 02:01:52.733]  I've asked them, how are things going?
[02:01:52.733 --> 02:01:54.194]  Suicide is spiking.
[02:01:54.194 --> 02:01:55.595]  Education has dropped off.
[02:01:55.595 --> 02:01:56.496]  Economic collapse.
[02:01:57.316 --> 02:02:02.620]  Medical industry, we're all suffering because our staff isn't here, and we have no volume.
[02:02:02.620 --> 02:02:04.942]  These are all real things that I'm seeing every day.
[02:02:04.942 --> 02:02:06.503]  I don't read about this stuff.
[02:02:06.503 --> 02:02:08.284]  I'm seeing it in my clinics.
[02:02:08.284 --> 02:02:12.828]  We have clinics from Fresno to San Diego, and these things are spiking in our community.
[02:02:12.828 --> 02:02:15.990]  These things will affect people for a lifetime, not for a season.
[02:02:15.990 --> 02:02:19.012]  And I've talked to, you know, the head of the CDPH.
[02:02:19.012 --> 02:02:23.136]  I've gotten their opinion on this, and a lot of the leaders in Sacramento.
[02:02:23.136 --> 02:02:24.336]  And we're all in agreement.
[02:02:25.177 --> 02:02:30.344]  But we need to have Governor Newsom in agreement with us to lift this ban.
[02:02:30.344 --> 02:02:32.426]  It's this stuff that'll kill the New World Order, folks.
[02:02:32.426 --> 02:02:34.609]  This is real medical information.
[02:02:34.609 --> 02:02:35.971]  It's everything you've already heard here.
[02:02:35.971 --> 02:02:37.493]  It's everything you always knew.
[02:02:37.493 --> 02:02:42.199]  When you were a little kid and got sick, you could be 70 years old, you know Mama said, go out and get some sun.
[02:02:42.199 --> 02:02:43.460]  And then we're told today...
[02:02:44.582 --> 02:02:47.745]  Arrest people that give hope and say that.
[02:02:47.745 --> 02:02:55.874]  Arresting someone for sitting alone on the beach, tell me how that arrests the spread of the coronavirus from an epidemiological point of view.
[02:02:57.099 --> 02:02:58.460]  Yeah, I wasn't referring to that.
[02:02:58.460 --> 02:03:01.302]  I actually don't have the specifics as to why that happened.
[02:03:01.302 --> 02:03:13.712]  The Bill of Rights, as you well know, protects Americans' right and shrines their right to practice their religion as they see fit and to congregate together to assemble peacefully.
[02:03:13.712 --> 02:03:18.736]  By what authority did you nullify the Bill of Rights in issuing this order?
[02:03:18.736 --> 02:03:20.137]  How do you have the power to do that?
[02:03:21.107 --> 02:03:26.611]  That's above my pay grade, Tucker, so I wasn't thinking of the Bill of Rights when we did this.
[02:03:26.611 --> 02:03:39.139]  COVID-19 is going to be in our lives for at least the next year or until there's a vaccine, and we need to figure out a way to get back to as normal of a life as possible while this plays out in the background.
[02:03:39.139 --> 02:03:41.980]  The solution is not to lock us into our homes.
[02:03:41.980 --> 02:03:43.562]  See, Thomas Malthus, 260 years ago, said,
[02:03:50.421 --> 02:03:56.062]  Depopulation should be the highest priority of foreign policy towards the third world.
[02:03:56.062 --> 02:03:56.442]  Henry Kissinger, 1974.
[02:04:22.964 --> 02:04:32.487]  There's a need for a new world order, but it has different characteristics in different parts of the world.
[02:04:32.487 --> 02:04:40.551]  Jim Hoff joins us for the next 30 minutes and then after that we're going to go to Mike, Brendan, Mike, Jason, Nick, Carlos is up next.
[02:04:40.551 --> 02:04:41.671]  Carlos is the next caller.
[02:04:41.671 --> 02:04:43.392]  Sonny and Jeff we're going to talk to.
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:51.161]  I'm the top journalist out there in America right now about what's really happening and how bad this depression is about to be.
[02:04:51.161 --> 02:04:54.842]  Stay with us.
[02:04:54.842 --> 02:05:01.743]  There's a process where you take a stallion and you tie him down and you cut his testicles off and then he becomes gelded.
[02:05:01.743 --> 02:05:04.483]  Well, that's what's happening to the entire world right now.
[02:05:04.483 --> 02:05:06.564]  We're going into deep, deep tyranny.
[02:05:06.564 --> 02:05:09.404]  Places like North Korea and China are going into deeper tyranny as well.
[02:05:09.404 --> 02:05:11.044]  It's all directed by the UN.
[02:05:11.044 --> 02:05:13.425]  It's all a big, cooked up, giant plan.
[02:05:14.105 --> 02:05:19.487]  To absolutely take control of your life, bankrupt the economy, and make you dependent on the big mega banks.
[02:05:19.487 --> 02:05:26.509]  And to get your universal income, you're going to have to take the inoculations, brainwash your kids the way they say, and have absolutely no freedom.
[02:05:26.509 --> 02:05:28.770]  And it's all happening, boom, overnight.
[02:05:28.770 --> 02:05:30.810]  This is a giant revolution.
[02:05:30.810 --> 02:05:34.692]  And as soon as you put the handcuffs on, they said, oh, it's just an extended spring break, two weeks.
[02:05:34.692 --> 02:05:37.492]  Notice now it's 18 months, two years, five years.
[02:05:37.492 --> 02:05:38.613]  It never ends.
[02:05:38.613 --> 02:05:40.793]  No one can ever die from a virus again.
[02:05:40.793 --> 02:05:41.854]  Government will save you.
[02:05:42.674 --> 02:05:43.916]  It's a takeover.
[02:05:43.916 --> 02:05:44.676]  It's the opposite.
[02:05:44.676 --> 02:05:53.887]  They're coming with forced inoculations on record that will reduce your fertility, lower your immunity, and in many cases kill you, and they're telling you it's going to hurt a lot of people.
[02:06:04.930 --> 02:06:05.511]  Welcome back.
[02:06:05.511 --> 02:06:07.913]  I'm Alex Jones, your host here in the third hour and 30 minutes.
[02:06:07.913 --> 02:06:09.794]  We're gonna go right to your calls.
[02:06:09.794 --> 02:06:13.897]  Jim Hoft is the head of GatewayPundit.com, one of the biggest news sites in the world.
[02:06:13.897 --> 02:06:17.140]  Not just one of the biggest pro-America sites in the world.
[02:06:17.140 --> 02:06:18.061]  We're so glad to have him.
[02:06:19.315 --> 02:06:37.243]  He's an author and again does great work over there heading up gatewaypundit.com vgatewaypundit.com does need an introduction and so I want to give him the floor to cover whatever he thinks is important up front but I look at that USA Today article yesterday saying it's true and they're fact-checked that
[02:06:38.144 --> 02:06:44.274]  You get $40,000 for somebody with COVID-19 versus $4,000 without somebody else.
[02:06:44.274 --> 02:06:52.266]  It's all incentivized and they now admit all the models were 30 to 10 times, you know, 10 to 30 times higher than what they said.
[02:06:53.570 --> 02:06:55.891]  Hey Alex, good to be with you.
[02:07:19.537 --> 02:07:23.400]  And we do have a couple stories I'd like to mention right off the bat.
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:31.107]  One is that this Chinese doctor, they call the Bat Lady, her name is Shi Shengli.
[02:07:31.107 --> 02:07:40.514]  I don't think this is getting much press in the United States, but she actually was doing some work here on the East Coast for a few years.
[02:07:40.514 --> 02:07:43.276]  She worked for the North Carolina doctor.
[02:07:43.276 --> 02:07:46.239]  And what happened was their testing was shut down.
[02:07:46.909 --> 02:07:56.512]  So then she went over back to Wuhan at the Wuhan Virus Lab, where she was running that program there.
[02:07:56.512 --> 02:08:08.475]  And around the same time, Alex, we found out that Dr. Fauci and the State Department gave this woman, the Bat Lady, $3.7 million.
[02:08:08.475 --> 02:08:10.036]  Now, this was around the time she was
[02:08:10.592 --> 02:08:15.637]  They shut down their program on coronavirus here in the United States and she fled back to China.
[02:08:15.637 --> 02:08:18.800]  I don't know if fled is the right word, but she went back to China.
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:20.661]  And then we're funding her program over there.
[02:08:20.661 --> 02:08:22.203]  It doesn't make much sense.
[02:08:22.203 --> 02:08:31.071]  There's also evidence that there were some leaks when she was working on these different, you know, coronavirus projects.
[02:08:31.738 --> 02:08:39.963]  And there was one, I'm sure your listeners and your viewers know this, but a couple people died, and that was before this year.
[02:08:39.963 --> 02:08:42.084]  That was a couple years ago.
[02:08:42.084 --> 02:08:43.444]  So it's just really interesting.
[02:08:43.444 --> 02:08:46.046]  I should have said up front, so just to recap this.
[02:08:46.046 --> 02:08:50.368]  You've been at the cutting edge of exposing the Chinese bioweapon operation.
[02:08:50.368 --> 02:08:51.169]  Is this a bioweapon?
[02:08:51.169 --> 02:08:54.650]  We don't obviously know, but they are testing bioweapons.
[02:08:54.650 --> 02:08:58.232]  You've got arrest of the head of Harvard Biology.
[02:08:58.232 --> 02:09:01.074]  What's the best thinking right now on what's really behind this virus?
[02:09:02.418 --> 02:09:10.664]  Yeah, well, I think we know for sure that it was not from one of those wet markets in Wuhan.
[02:09:10.664 --> 02:09:12.805]  That has been discredited.
[02:09:12.805 --> 02:09:21.611]  That was a Chinese propaganda tool that they used to deflect that this was actually from one of the laboratories in Wuhan.
[02:09:21.611 --> 02:09:23.052]  And I think it's pretty clear.
[02:09:23.052 --> 02:09:26.134]  And we did some research, Alex, where we did some
[02:09:26.564 --> 02:09:26.944]  We're good to go.
[02:09:43.384 --> 02:10:11.202]  Where this was from 2017 and and she was interviewed there and she was talking about the work in the laboratory in the coronavirus and that she had been to the bat caves 900 kilometers away and so there's a lot of information out there but the US media has not touched this and what's interesting and you know this as well as I do is you know as conservatives know this now the media we're in this strange
[02:10:11.929 --> 02:10:17.112]  Uh, period, right now, where the media and the tech giants get to tell us what's approved information.
[02:10:17.112 --> 02:10:18.232]  Well, that was my next point.
[02:10:18.232 --> 02:10:23.055]  They're openly banning medical doctors coming out, saying that the hospitals are empty.
[02:10:23.055 --> 02:10:26.656]  They're banning CNR Sinai, saying white therapy's a real deal.
[02:10:26.656 --> 02:10:33.960]  I mean, they're now banning most prestigious institutions out there, and parroting Chinese communist propaganda.
[02:10:35.117 --> 02:10:35.858]  Absolutely.
[02:10:35.858 --> 02:10:53.047]  We're seeing this over and over, and the best example was last night when Laura Ingram on the Fox News Channel had a couple of these doctors from California on, and as soon as they went off the air, YouTube erased their videos that were out there from the local news in California, and they're just gone.
[02:10:53.047 --> 02:10:57.650]  So it's stunning what's happening, and it's very disappointing.
[02:10:57.650 --> 02:10:59.411]  They're not getting rid of things that are dissentable.
[02:10:59.411 --> 02:11:00.812]  They're getting rid of real credibility.
[02:11:02.075 --> 02:11:03.556]  Absolutely, and it's very disappointing.
[02:11:03.556 --> 02:11:12.661]  I know you know this better than anyone, and that is, where the hell are the politicians or the conservatives or anybody who believes in freedom of speech in this country?
[02:11:12.661 --> 02:11:13.942]  Why are they silent?
[02:11:13.942 --> 02:11:23.287]  Now they're getting worse and worse and worse, what they've done to people like you and Gateway Pundit and other people with just erasing us off the internet.
[02:11:23.907 --> 02:11:28.070]  And now they're ramping it up and telling us what we can read about coronavirus.
[02:11:28.070 --> 02:11:35.436]  Jim, you've been censored, I've been censored, but they've moved on from us to medical doctors that are on record giving press conferences.
[02:11:35.436 --> 02:11:40.960]  Those are being banned because it doesn't go with the narrative that it's all Trump's fault.
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:41.781]  Right, absolutely.
[02:11:41.781 --> 02:11:45.804]  And then you said Trump's, I'm not mad at Trump, but I am mad at Trump.
[02:11:45.804 --> 02:11:47.265]  What the hell?
[02:11:47.265 --> 02:11:50.107]  I mean, are they going to censor the weather report next?
[02:11:50.107 --> 02:11:52.049]  I mean, this is like total control.
[02:11:53.326 --> 02:12:09.035]  Absolutely, and it's frightening because, as you know, as we reported on your show first about a month ago now, or over a month, and that was that these numbers that they threw at us were completely ridiculous in early March.
[02:12:09.035 --> 02:12:16.299]  They were saying at the time 2 million Americans would die when the country that had the most deaths at the time, Italy, had like 8,000.
[02:12:16.299 --> 02:12:22.422]  How they came up with these ridiculous numbers, they still haven't explained, they haven't apologized,
[02:12:23.004 --> 02:12:35.850]  These doctors running the show in Washington D.C., Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci, they still haven't apologized and they haven't, they haven't... That's right, all their models were wrong.
[02:12:35.850 --> 02:12:36.750]  So what do we do then?
[02:12:36.750 --> 02:12:37.350]  What does Trump do?
[02:12:37.350 --> 02:12:39.331]  What do you want to say to them?
[02:12:39.331 --> 02:12:43.113]  Well, I think Trump needs to take a big U-turn here.
[02:12:43.113 --> 02:12:45.834]  And, you know, he needs to focus on the economy.
[02:12:45.834 --> 02:12:47.355]  That's what scares the hell out of me.
[02:12:47.355 --> 02:12:49.396]  I think, as you know, Alex,
[02:12:50.129 --> 02:12:52.150]  Again, probably better than anyone.
[02:12:52.150 --> 02:12:56.851]  The American public today is just absolutely in a panic.
[02:12:56.851 --> 02:13:18.279]  There's this underlying panic, and rightfully so, because as people start to wake up and see that these numbers are no worse today than what we've seen with seasonal flus, we actually had a seasonal flu in 1957-58 that was much worse than what we're seeing with this coronavirus, and the fact that we have these
[02:13:18.732 --> 02:13:27.836]  These hacks, Fauci and Birx, why are they not emphasizing that these are 75 and 80 year olds are the target of this virus?
[02:13:27.836 --> 02:13:28.736]  Why aren't they emphasizing that?
[02:13:28.736 --> 02:13:31.657]  Oh, they're clearly trying to kill the economy ahead of the election.
[02:13:31.657 --> 02:13:42.301]  I mean, now with Facebook, Twitter, Google blocking Sears, Sinai and medical doctors agreeing with Trump, this is just, now they're blocking medical people?
[02:13:42.301 --> 02:13:44.062]  This is like worse than North Korea.
[02:13:45.536 --> 02:13:46.617]  Absolutely.
[02:13:46.617 --> 02:13:47.877]  And here's something else.
[02:13:47.877 --> 02:13:50.859]  It's not just happening here in the United States.
[02:13:50.859 --> 02:13:55.681]  My twin brother, who's been on your show before, he's in Hong Kong.
[02:13:55.681 --> 02:13:59.423]  And Alex, listen to this and see if you can make any sense out of this.
[02:13:59.423 --> 02:14:04.125]  In Hong Kong, which you literally walk across the hall and you're in China.
[02:14:04.125 --> 02:14:07.567]  And I've been there several times to see my brother.
[02:14:07.567 --> 02:14:13.390]  We've been into the Chinese mainland there and they have a total of
[02:14:13.834 --> 02:14:20.016]  Four deaths from coronavirus in a city that is as packed together as you can be.
[02:14:20.016 --> 02:14:28.038]  I don't think there's a more densely populated area in the world than Hong Kong and Kowloon, which is across the bay from Hong Kong.
[02:14:28.038 --> 02:14:33.040]  And yet they've had four, four, just four coronavirus deaths.
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:37.081]  And the Chinese, or whoever is in control, and we know it's the Chinese,
[02:14:37.640 --> 02:14:40.542]  Um, they still have this, this, uh, Hong Kong in lockdown.
[02:14:40.542 --> 02:14:41.503]  Over four deaths.
[02:14:41.503 --> 02:14:44.525]  They've had 130 flu deaths in that same time period.
[02:14:44.525 --> 02:14:45.166]  Well, that's it.
[02:14:45.166 --> 02:14:55.833]  They're using it as a total control, and they're using... Most of the studies I've seen show that regular coronavirus, the cold virus, or the flu virus, is counting as positive.
[02:14:55.833 --> 02:15:02.818]  I mean, even as you mentioned, the scarf lady admits that they count all deaths that test positive as this.
[02:15:02.818 --> 02:15:04.339]  So that's what they're doing.
[02:15:04.339 --> 02:15:06.421]  This is a medical tyranny against the President.
[02:15:07.555 --> 02:15:08.436]  Absolutely.
[02:15:08.436 --> 02:15:13.039]  And we saw that with just New York adding 3,700 deaths out of nowhere.
[02:15:13.039 --> 02:15:18.404]  They pulled them out of a hat and threw them in the pile last week.
[02:15:18.404 --> 02:15:23.668]  And then we saw Pennsylvania trying to sneak in 269 deaths.
[02:15:23.668 --> 02:15:25.169]  That was the day after the protests.
[02:15:25.169 --> 02:15:26.070]  Himhoff, stay there.
[02:15:26.070 --> 02:15:29.953]  In the final segment, I'm going to try to give you the floor to say what you think the president should do.
[02:15:31.738 --> 02:15:34.580]  Where do you think this goes if we don't take action and shut it down?
[02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:38.383]  The states are trying to reopen and they're blaming every death on Trump.
[02:15:38.383 --> 02:15:39.444]  This is incredible.
[02:15:39.444 --> 02:15:42.167]  This is how the globalists are striking back.
[02:15:42.167 --> 02:15:46.390]  Jim Hoffman, GatewayPundit.com, one of the top websites in the world for freedom.
[02:15:46.390 --> 02:15:47.311]  When we come back, stay with us.
[02:15:54.062 --> 02:15:59.306]  This is a pandemic survival alert, and the most time-sensitive messages you will hear this year.
[02:15:59.306 --> 02:16:05.230]  You still have time to plant a one-acre crisis garden and secure a supply of your own nutrient-dense food.
[02:16:05.230 --> 02:16:08.813]  But time is running out, and it's one deadline you don't want to miss.
[02:16:08.813 --> 02:16:10.514]  Who should plant a crisis garden?
[02:16:10.514 --> 02:16:15.918]  Individuals, families, churches, communities, anyone or any group that sees hard times ahead.
[02:16:15.918 --> 02:16:22.703]  Let's face it, even the mainline media is talking about food supply disruptions and the growing number of grocery store workers who are becoming sick.
[02:16:22.703 --> 02:16:23.384]  But there's more.
[02:16:23.584 --> 02:16:29.608]  Meatpacking plants are closing, mile-long lines at food pantries, and more farmers now in financial trouble.
[02:16:29.608 --> 02:16:35.552]  The truth is, growing nutrient-dense vegetables this summer may be the single most important thing you do.

[02:16:59.442 --> 02:17:01.004]  You know what's really dumb?
[02:17:01.004 --> 02:17:02.666]  To ignore your immune system.

[02:17:54.724 --> 02:18:03.188]  Authoritarians across the planet want the power to be able to tell you to stay in your houses and don't leave, and only go where they tell you to go.
[02:18:03.188 --> 02:18:05.209]  It's called martial law.
[02:18:05.209 --> 02:18:07.070]  It's called living in an authoritarian country.
[02:18:07.070 --> 02:18:08.531]  Everybody knows that.
[02:18:08.531 --> 02:18:10.112]  Everybody understands that.
[02:18:10.112 --> 02:18:20.497]  And the Democrats have now shown their hands with the deep state, saying, we're going to listen to Fauci and the World Health Organization, who've done nothing but put out all this fake disinformation so far.
[02:18:20.497 --> 02:18:22.598]  We're not going to listen to the president.
[02:18:22.598 --> 02:18:23.779]  We're not going to listen to Congress.
[02:18:24.839 --> 02:18:32.183]  That all these other corporations are going to work in tandem with big tech to surveil and control and keep things shut down.
[02:18:32.183 --> 02:18:35.285]  This is economic warfare and I know everybody understands that.
[02:18:35.285 --> 02:18:49.172]  Public, with the President and others, need to develop a plan to understand that this is a global corporate civil war and that we're being held hostage and this is a mutiny against our country by globalist forces.
[02:18:49.172 --> 02:18:53.875]  Only understanding the reality and the magnitude of that gives us any chance of defeating it.
[02:18:55.117 --> 02:19:09.959]  Hiding in plain view, Politico, the Associated Press, you name it, admit that a half a billion people, extra 500 million, are now at the subsistence starvation level on top of all the millions already starving because of the global lockdown.
[02:19:09.959 --> 02:19:10.280]  That is
[02:19:10.720 --> 02:19:26.766]  Hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19, and the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the CHICOMS at the World Health Organization, with Bill Gates involved, are now the ones running the operation to shut down society, create a depression, and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[02:19:26.766 --> 02:19:27.226]  Thank you, everybody.
[02:19:27.226 --> 02:19:28.006]  This is insane.
[02:19:28.006 --> 02:19:30.687]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[02:19:30.687 --> 02:19:32.148]  You need to get prepared now.
[02:19:32.148 --> 02:19:36.669]  You need to get high-quality, storable food now back in stock at InfowarStore.com.
[02:19:36.669 --> 02:19:40.750]  And you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[02:19:40.750 --> 02:19:47.032]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing.
[02:19:47.032 --> 02:19:49.013]  This is beyond 1984.
[02:19:49.013 --> 02:19:50.614]  The tyranny of the dual order is here.
[02:19:50.614 --> 02:19:53.034]  Get prepared now and spread the word in the Infowar.
[02:19:53.034 --> 02:19:54.435]  You are the Paul Reveres!
[02:19:57.768 --> 02:20:13.961]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:13.961 --> 02:20:21.388]  Things are so real, so dangerous, so insane, that I... I've been choking on air.
[02:20:21.388 --> 02:20:24.750]  And on air 26 years, you've seen me choking out.
[02:20:24.750 --> 02:20:26.392]  Because I'm tongue-tied.
[02:20:27.734 --> 02:20:37.075]  And Jim Hoss, our guest, here's one of the chief White House advisors on the economy saying that what was lost in the 2008 recession in just a day, in a month, we're losing every day.
[02:20:37.075 --> 02:20:37.435]  Here it is.
[02:20:38.220 --> 02:20:38.480]  Yes.
[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:46.025]  And I'm sure that over the next three or four weeks, everybody's going to pull together and come up with a plan to give us the best chance possible for a V-shaped recovery.
[02:20:46.025 --> 02:20:49.107]  But make no mistake, it's a really grave situation, George.
[02:20:49.107 --> 02:20:52.409]  This is the biggest negative shock that our economy, I think, has ever seen.
[02:20:52.409 --> 02:20:58.454]  We're going to be looking at an unemployment rate that approaches rates that we saw during the Great Depression.
[02:20:58.454 --> 02:21:06.399]  During the Great Recession, remember that was a financial crisis around 2008, that we lost 8.7 million jobs in the whole thing.
[02:21:06.399 --> 02:21:08.200]  Right now, we're losing that many jobs about every year.
[02:21:09.601 --> 02:21:10.862]  About every week or so.
[02:21:10.862 --> 02:21:17.688]  So, Jim Hoft, looking at this, obviously this is meant to stall the economy.
[02:21:17.688 --> 02:21:18.629]  Bill Maher wanted it.
[02:21:18.629 --> 02:21:20.030]  Democrats wanted it.
[02:21:20.030 --> 02:21:22.712]  It's blue states, blue cities blocking the economy.
[02:21:22.712 --> 02:21:29.218]  How do they think they're going to get away with a worldwide depression they're going to blame on America and Trump?
[02:21:29.218 --> 02:21:34.763]  Yeah, Alex, this is just frightening what we're seeing and like you just played.
[02:21:35.080 --> 02:21:40.485]  They're looking at numbers greater than the Great Depression.
[02:21:40.485 --> 02:21:41.486]  These unemployment numbers.
[02:21:41.486 --> 02:21:42.967]  It's just absolutely frightening.
[02:21:42.967 --> 02:21:50.634]  And I think what people haven't experienced yet, Alex, and you're in tune with this, but there's a lot of people who have lost their businesses.
[02:21:50.634 --> 02:21:51.674]  They're losing their jobs.
[02:21:51.674 --> 02:22:00.082]  We're seeing these brave hairdressers who are down in Texas and in California who are opening their shops because
[02:22:00.626 --> 02:22:02.087]  They don't want to go broke.
[02:22:02.087 --> 02:22:10.231]  We had the woman down in Texas said, I have a right in this country to make a living and to feed my children.
[02:22:10.231 --> 02:22:15.935]  And really, they should be putting that woman on the air every day because that's what this is about.
[02:22:15.935 --> 02:22:23.459]  If something doesn't change soon, we're going to have, what, 20, 30 million or more out of work?
[02:22:23.459 --> 02:22:25.800]  We're going to have all these businesses shut down?
[02:22:25.800 --> 02:22:27.281]  It makes no sense.
[02:22:27.281 --> 02:22:29.002]  None of this has made any sense.
[02:22:29.002 --> 02:22:30.303]  And wait till they figure out
[02:22:30.785 --> 02:22:40.321]  That the numbers that we're seeing right now are not much worse, if at all, than a seasonal flu.
[02:22:40.321 --> 02:22:43.426]  I think that the American people are going to be outraged.
[02:22:44.514 --> 02:22:57.320]  Well, Jim Hoft of GatewayPundit.com, that's my point is, they already have Bill Gates, as you know, and all the left on TV blaming Trump when they're the ones that created the stampede and the hysteria and forced Trump into it.
[02:22:57.320 --> 02:23:00.361]  They're betting we have no attention span, like Gruber famously said.
[02:23:00.361 --> 02:23:04.123]  I think they're wrong, Jim.
[02:23:04.123 --> 02:23:05.044]  I hope you're right, Alex.
[02:23:06.581 --> 02:23:11.165]  You're the calming voice at this point, because everything else is just out of control.
[02:23:11.165 --> 02:23:11.826]  It's just crazy.
[02:23:11.826 --> 02:23:15.730]  Yeah, like Alex Jones is everything's okay, and the rest of me is like, death, it's all over.
[02:23:15.730 --> 02:23:18.613]  Right.
[02:23:18.613 --> 02:23:28.142]  I mean, but what they've done here, and you know, it's just amazing to see that there's actually reporters out there who are still
[02:23:28.595 --> 02:23:32.858]  You know, they haven't caught on yet with the real numbers.
[02:23:32.858 --> 02:23:37.581]  They haven't looked at these numbers, which, you know, again, we saw last month.
[02:23:37.581 --> 02:23:45.406]  It wasn't making sense that they're predicting two million dead when, you know, we'd only seen a few thousand dead in the whole world.
[02:23:45.406 --> 02:23:48.248]  So I don't know how they get away with this.
[02:23:48.248 --> 02:23:50.229]  And, you know, I certainly won't forget.
[02:23:50.229 --> 02:23:53.291]  And as long as we have our website, we're not going to forget.
[02:23:53.291 --> 02:23:54.852]  We're going to be pushing the truth.
[02:23:54.852 --> 02:23:57.274]  But it looks like the media plan,
[02:23:57.902 --> 02:24:07.711]  Is to just push these lies and then get the tech giants to shut down any voice that is saying something different.
[02:24:07.711 --> 02:24:16.619]  I'm going to play this clip after you're gone and go to calls, but UN chief says pandemic must be used to de-industrialize West, transition to green energy.
[02:24:16.619 --> 02:24:19.702]  They've been bragging, this is AOC's green plan now.
[02:24:19.702 --> 02:24:21.304]  This is good for the earth, CNN says.
[02:24:22.978 --> 02:24:23.619]  Unbelievable.
[02:24:23.619 --> 02:24:33.086]  And this is the same guy, this UN chief, who also said that this is a good time to start giving universal incomes to people, you know?
[02:24:33.086 --> 02:24:34.587]  So that means, of course, the U.S.
[02:24:34.587 --> 02:24:36.909]  has to start funding the whole world.
[02:24:36.909 --> 02:24:41.112]  When we don't have the money and we have 30... And by the way, talk about a Venezuelan model.
[02:24:41.112 --> 02:24:43.934]  No one can go to work, but there's free stuff coming.
[02:24:43.934 --> 02:24:48.137]  The robots aren't running stuff yet, even in some fictitious thing.
[02:24:48.137 --> 02:24:49.478]  So what are the leftists trying?
[02:24:49.478 --> 02:24:51.239]  They're obviously using a Marxist-Leninist
[02:24:52.574 --> 02:24:56.101]  Playing a revolution right now, using the viruses to cover.
[02:24:56.101 --> 02:24:57.483]  Where do you think this goes?
[02:24:59.022 --> 02:25:10.730]  Well, I think what's going to save us again are the young hairdressers and the business owners out of America who get fed up and realize they have to make some payments soon.
[02:25:10.730 --> 02:25:11.631]  Oh, I agree.
[02:25:11.631 --> 02:25:16.674]  Look, three weeks ago, I was at my haircutter's office at his house just cutting my hair.
[02:25:16.674 --> 02:25:20.677]  And everybody I know, my wife gets her lashes and nails done at the lady's house now.
[02:25:20.677 --> 02:25:23.099]  It's almost better because they're like cutting out the middlemen.
[02:25:24.620 --> 02:25:28.042]  I may never go back to the nail or lash place, my wife said.
[02:25:28.042 --> 02:25:30.284]  I'll go pay this lady less, she makes more.
[02:25:30.284 --> 02:25:32.925]  In a way, it's not actually vertically integrating.
[02:25:32.925 --> 02:25:35.967]  It's actually getting rid of the middleman.
[02:25:35.967 --> 02:25:37.768]  Absolutely.
[02:25:37.768 --> 02:25:42.191]  And, you know, I actually had someone come clean our house today.
[02:25:42.191 --> 02:25:43.112]  We used to use a
[02:25:43.965 --> 02:25:47.587]  Service, but now we just hired somebody to come over and clean the house.
[02:25:47.587 --> 02:25:53.169]  And so a lot of people are doing this, but I think in the long run, these businesses better wake up or they won't be around.
[02:25:53.169 --> 02:25:55.150]  And, you know, that's just you get it.
[02:25:55.150 --> 02:25:59.912]  It's going to be apps tracking you that an individual wasn't authorized came to your house.
[02:25:59.912 --> 02:26:02.814]  I mean, they're announcing the end of free speech.
[02:26:02.814 --> 02:26:03.914]  Big Tech loves it.
[02:26:03.914 --> 02:26:09.637]  This is kind of they're coming out and saying, we're going to track you with your phone and make sure you only use big box stores.
[02:26:10.856 --> 02:26:11.637]  Right, absolutely.
[02:26:11.637 --> 02:26:21.225]  And we've already seen that, the same type of talk right now saying if you have the coronavirus and you're walking around, we're going to warn people around you that you have the coronavirus.
[02:26:21.225 --> 02:26:25.989]  I mean, what's preventing them from using this same sort of a system for other things?
[02:26:25.989 --> 02:26:30.693]  Seriously, how about we all just wear yellow stars?
[02:26:30.693 --> 02:26:31.974]  Basically, that's what they're pushing.
[02:26:31.974 --> 02:26:37.339]  And it's really shocking that this is happening in America and that more people aren't upset about it.
[02:26:38.353 --> 02:26:41.994]  Well, that's because we've, it's like dodo birds were on that island and nobody ever hunted them.
[02:26:41.994 --> 02:26:44.454]  So when sailors showed up, they just kill them.
[02:26:44.454 --> 02:26:53.256]  We have to build our psychological, political immune system again and recognize why we don't support the police state, which is not being anti-police folks.
[02:26:53.256 --> 02:26:55.857]  It means we're anti-police state, meaning no due process.
[02:26:55.857 --> 02:27:00.317]  Jim Hoff, the two minutes we have left, you're covering so many dizzying articles.
[02:27:00.317 --> 02:27:06.079]  You're probably, other than InfoWars, I got to say the number one news site in the world for really cutting edge pro-human stuff.
[02:27:06.079 --> 02:27:07.979]  What else is on your front burner right now?
[02:27:09.295 --> 02:27:10.756]  Well, it's interesting.
[02:27:10.756 --> 02:27:16.582]  You know, we continue to see the media attack Trump day in and day out.
[02:27:16.582 --> 02:27:17.883]  They never learn.
[02:27:17.883 --> 02:27:19.224]  Nobody trusts the media today.
[02:27:19.224 --> 02:27:30.514]  And even this afternoon or this morning when Trump was with Florida Governor DeSantis, some reporter attacked Trump about the testing in the U.S.
[02:27:30.514 --> 02:27:31.575]  and found out that
[02:27:32.219 --> 02:27:32.359]  I don't
[02:27:50.526 --> 02:27:51.167]  B.S.
[02:27:51.167 --> 02:27:54.069]  arguments and throws them at Trump and tries to be my stick.
[02:27:54.069 --> 02:27:55.310]  Well, that's my final point.
[02:27:55.310 --> 02:27:59.694]  The New York Times last week of all places came out and said the Chinese government's funding the media.
[02:27:59.694 --> 02:28:00.835]  Is that not espionage?
[02:28:00.835 --> 02:28:03.637]  Like, if you were getting Russian money, I'd call for Jim Hoff's arrest.
[02:28:03.637 --> 02:28:05.119]  If I was, arrest Alex Jones.
[02:28:05.119 --> 02:28:07.060]  We don't get Russian money, we get American money.
[02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:10.243]  But how do these other publications get CHICOM money?
[02:28:10.243 --> 02:28:10.704]  What the hell?
[02:28:11.837 --> 02:28:13.018]  Yeah, it makes no sense.
[02:28:13.018 --> 02:28:22.324]  And we're the ones who actually have to fight for every nickel and dime we get because we've been targeted by actually our own government and by these American companies.
[02:28:22.324 --> 02:28:22.965]  Exactly.
[02:28:22.965 --> 02:28:25.607]  Gateway Pond and Infowars are 100% funded by people.
[02:28:25.607 --> 02:28:26.347]  We know that.
[02:28:26.347 --> 02:28:29.870]  But now it comes out that all this big media is funded by China.
[02:28:29.870 --> 02:28:32.372]  Where's the investigation there?
[02:28:32.372 --> 02:28:33.012]  Right.
[02:28:33.012 --> 02:28:34.833]  Absolutely.
[02:28:34.833 --> 02:28:36.034]  You know, something has to happen.
[02:28:36.034 --> 02:28:36.975]  But our media, we know that
[02:28:37.714 --> 02:28:43.983]  Alex, it's not just that they're biased anymore, but we know that they're just pushing complete lies on the American public.
[02:28:43.983 --> 02:28:48.809]  Exactly, they're not biased, they're lying on purpose, and they're riding the Chodcom Ding Dong.
[02:28:48.809 --> 02:28:49.971]  Thank you so much, Jim Hoff.
[02:28:49.971 --> 02:28:50.712]  Great job.
[02:28:50.712 --> 02:28:51.353]  Paul's coming up.
[02:28:51.353 --> 02:28:52.414]  Stay with us.
[02:28:52.414 --> 02:28:52.775]  Thank you, Jim.
[02:28:54.355 --> 02:28:55.235]  Attention, gardeners!
[02:28:55.235 --> 02:28:59.176]  If you need to grow nutritionally dense vegetables or medicinal herbs this year, listen!
[02:28:59.176 --> 02:29:02.337]  Because a bioactive superfood for plants is now available!
[02:29:02.337 --> 02:29:11.959]  This all-natural superfood for plants is so effective at producing maximum plant growth in minimum time that it almost forces plants to grow, even under the worst light and soil conditions.
[02:29:11.959 --> 02:29:14.700]  It's called Proto-Gro, and it's truly remarkable.
[02:29:14.700 --> 02:29:18.660]  Vegetables grow faster and contain more bioavailable vitamins and trace minerals.
[02:29:18.660 --> 02:29:20.861]  Plants that rarely bloom will flower constantly.
[02:29:21.181 --> 02:29:23.243]  Sickly plants become vibrantly alive.
[02:29:23.243 --> 02:29:25.425]  Medicinal herbs become super potent.
[02:29:25.425 --> 02:29:28.388]  Flowers become more vivid right before your very eyes.
[02:29:28.388 --> 02:29:31.831]  Proto-Gro also improves the taste quality of all your garden vegetables.
[02:29:31.831 --> 02:29:34.894]  That's because it's more than just an all-natural superfood for plants.

[02:29:40.180 --> 02:29:44.604]  Which is why Proto-Gro even renews your garden by increasing the microorganisms in the soil.

[02:29:54.890 --> 02:30:02.395]  One of our best-selling products is Living Defense, and it's been sold out for over four months because it's hard to source the ingredients that are organic.
[02:30:02.395 --> 02:30:08.579]  We've got a limited supply right now, but it's selling out fast, and I want those of you that haven't experienced Living Defense to get it for yourself.
[02:30:08.579 --> 02:30:10.040]  Here's just part of one testimonial.
[02:30:10.260 --> 02:30:12.901]  Look, in January 2016, I went in a hospital.
[02:30:12.901 --> 02:30:16.422]  I went in a VA hospital out here in Boise, and I was in there until June.
[02:30:16.422 --> 02:30:25.686]  And one of the only things that got me through that ordeal was listening to Info Wars three hours a day, and I kept hearing Dr. Group and all you guys talking about living defense.
[02:30:25.686 --> 02:30:26.666]  Let me tell you something, man.
[02:30:26.766 --> 02:30:31.649]  I had an internal digestive problem and I suffered with it for about five or six years.
[02:30:31.649 --> 02:30:33.531]  And the doctors, they tried every test.
[02:30:33.531 --> 02:30:35.032]  Nobody could figure out what it is.
[02:30:35.032 --> 02:30:39.015]  And then every day when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group and those commercials, I said, you know what?
[02:30:39.015 --> 02:30:41.196]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking Living Defense.
[02:30:41.196 --> 02:30:44.218]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritions because they don't want you to have it.
[02:30:44.218 --> 02:30:46.100]  But I ordered it, had it shipped to me.
[02:30:46.100 --> 02:30:46.640]  I got it.
[02:30:46.640 --> 02:30:47.861]  I hid it from the nurses.
[02:30:47.861 --> 02:30:48.902]  I started taking it.
[02:30:48.902 --> 02:30:50.963]  Man, that stuff changed my life.
[02:30:50.963 --> 02:30:51.884]  It saved my life.
[02:30:51.884 --> 02:30:54.606]  Alex Jones and InfoWars saved my life.
[02:30:55.390 --> 02:31:03.296]  Globalism is all about making the nation-state and the population itself obsolete, non-essential.
[02:31:03.296 --> 02:31:15.787]  That's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes, and controls to where family farms and industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate.
[02:31:15.787 --> 02:31:21.832]  That's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out,
[02:31:22.392 --> 02:31:26.675]  They can simply look at us and say, because again, you are not essential.
[02:31:26.675 --> 02:31:29.697]  That's what the robots and all of this is about.
[02:31:29.697 --> 02:31:33.859]  It's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives.
[02:31:33.859 --> 02:31:37.682]  We can be told to stay in our houses, and after all, shut up!
[02:31:37.682 --> 02:31:39.343]  This world doesn't belong to people anyways.
[02:31:39.343 --> 02:31:43.866]  It belongs to the new AI gods, the rich elitists that have merged with machines.
[02:31:43.866 --> 02:31:45.647]  Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[02:31:46.431 --> 02:31:49.573]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing.
[02:31:49.573 --> 02:31:55.416]  These people are completely psychotic, and make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[02:31:55.416 --> 02:32:01.199]  The superpower that I have is that I tell you what I really think, even if it ends up hurting me short term.
[02:32:01.199 --> 02:32:06.982]  I believe in God, and I believe in the long run, it'll end up being better for myself and everybody else in this world we live together in.
[02:32:06.982 --> 02:32:09.264]  I understand what comes around and goes around.
[02:32:09.264 --> 02:32:11.125]  You reap what you sow, and I live that.
[02:32:11.125 --> 02:32:13.126]  And I fundamentally, at a cellular level, understand it.
[02:32:18.277 --> 02:32:19.718]  We're good to go.
[02:32:41.736 --> 02:32:49.003]  Because I knew it was the right thing to do during a crisis to make sure people were incentivized to up their body's defenses.
[02:32:49.003 --> 02:32:57.771]  But now I'm telling you, with the economic crisis going on, get your storable food now.
[02:32:57.771 --> 02:33:00.434]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:12.984 --> 02:33:22.704]  Almost heaven, West Virginia Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
[02:33:25.894 --> 02:33:29.596]  You know they say God's invisible.
[02:33:29.596 --> 02:33:33.958]  But if you look at the sun, the sky,
[02:33:53.775 --> 02:33:54.976]  The fingerprints are on the farm.
[02:33:54.976 --> 02:33:57.339]  I mean, look at your children.
[02:33:57.339 --> 02:33:58.460]  Everything is good.
[02:33:58.460 --> 02:34:00.522]  You see God's fingerprints.
[02:34:00.522 --> 02:34:02.224]  You see God right there.
[02:34:02.224 --> 02:34:02.584]  Look at this.
[02:34:02.584 --> 02:34:04.807]  This is my little daughter right here.
[02:34:04.807 --> 02:34:06.849]  And, you know, these are the times with the enemy coming in on us.
[02:34:06.849 --> 02:34:08.811]  That's her a few years ago.
[02:34:08.811 --> 02:34:09.471]  So perfect.
[02:34:09.471 --> 02:34:11.233]  So pure.
[02:34:11.233 --> 02:34:12.234]  God shines through her.
[02:34:28.837 --> 02:34:31.800]  Because you can lie to yourself all day long.
[02:34:31.800 --> 02:34:33.661]  You joined the New World Order, man.
[02:34:33.661 --> 02:34:36.424]  You just turned your kids over to hell.
[02:34:36.424 --> 02:34:39.567]  And they're so innocent, and they're so good, and they're so pure.
[02:34:39.567 --> 02:34:42.649]  And they just want to understand the universe.
[02:34:42.649 --> 02:34:43.530]  Look how pure she is.
[02:34:43.530 --> 02:34:44.171]  Look how good she is.
[02:34:44.995 --> 02:34:47.636]  And some will say, oh, you put your daughter on there, you make her a target.
[02:34:47.636 --> 02:34:49.837]  She's already a target.
[02:34:49.837 --> 02:34:53.938]  She's already under attack by evil, just like every child on this planet.
[02:34:53.938 --> 02:34:57.499]  Because she can see God.
[02:34:57.499 --> 02:35:00.360]  She has innocence.
[02:35:00.360 --> 02:35:01.680]  And they want to corrupt that.
[02:35:01.680 --> 02:35:04.741]  They want to steal that.
[02:35:04.741 --> 02:35:09.083]  We're not going to let that happen.
[02:35:09.083 --> 02:35:09.763]  Because as men,
[02:35:14.991 --> 02:35:21.473]  We're not going to back down in the face of evil?
[02:35:21.473 --> 02:35:28.375]  Because if we don't do the right thing, we've turned our children over to the worst things in the universe.
[02:35:28.375 --> 02:35:31.055]  So I ask you again, are you going to stand with that?
[02:35:31.055 --> 02:35:32.876]  Are you going to go along with that?
[02:35:32.876 --> 02:35:34.096]  Are you going to submit to that?
[02:35:34.096 --> 02:35:35.797]  Like all these trendies?
[02:35:35.797 --> 02:35:36.717]  No, I don't think you are.
[02:35:36.717 --> 02:35:38.257]  All right, let's finish up with the calls.
[02:35:38.257 --> 02:35:41.338]  I really appreciate you holding some of you over an hour and a half.
[02:35:41.338 --> 02:35:43.499]  Let's go to Carlos in California.
[02:35:43.499 --> 02:35:44.139]  You're on the air.
[02:35:44.139 --> 02:35:44.419]  Welcome.
[02:35:45.834 --> 02:35:48.036]  Brother Alex, God bless you, sir, and the crew.
[02:35:48.036 --> 02:35:50.298]  I appreciate you, Carlos.
[02:35:50.298 --> 02:35:51.339]  Go ahead.
[02:35:51.339 --> 02:35:52.460]  Yes, sir.
[02:35:52.460 --> 02:35:54.362]  As usual, you are on target.
[02:35:54.362 --> 02:35:57.885]  This is a fight between good and evil, sir.
[02:35:57.885 --> 02:36:04.811]  This is a spiritual war, which we are fighting it on many levels, but we're not fighting it spiritually.
[02:36:04.811 --> 02:36:06.913]  Alex, you say yourself you are a channel.
[02:36:06.913 --> 02:36:08.534]  Well, I am a channel as well, sir.
[02:36:08.534 --> 02:36:11.557]  I've been given information on how to combat this.
[02:36:11.557 --> 02:36:12.758]  I need InfoWars' help.
[02:36:13.444 --> 02:36:14.945]  Okay, well that's what everybody says.
[02:36:37.492 --> 02:36:38.312]  I got a cousin.
[02:36:38.312 --> 02:36:40.013]  Everybody always over plans it.
[02:36:40.013 --> 02:36:41.533]  They're always never going to do it.
[02:36:41.533 --> 02:36:44.734]  They're always waiting to launch the perfect plan.
[02:36:44.734 --> 02:36:45.875]  Sir, yes sir.
[02:36:45.875 --> 02:36:50.116]  I got a cousin out in Arlington who's a Southern Methodist minister.
[02:36:50.116 --> 02:36:50.396]  Great!
[02:36:50.396 --> 02:36:51.657]  What's he doing to fight the rebels?
[02:36:51.657 --> 02:36:53.918]  Tell me what you're doing.
[02:36:53.918 --> 02:37:01.600]  Well, first and foremost, it's all about energy at the end of the day.
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:04.181]  The enemy, like you said, they're bloodsuckers.
[02:37:04.181 --> 02:37:04.901]  They want our energy.
[02:37:04.901 --> 02:37:05.501]  We don't want to
[02:37:07.972 --> 02:37:14.417]  We don't want to turn over our kids because we're not standing up now on a spiritual level.
[02:37:14.417 --> 02:37:20.602]  And because we've been put into a trance, the globalists get everything because we're convinced, oh, just submit.
[02:37:20.602 --> 02:37:23.945]  No, submission is in a waterfall into hell.
[02:37:23.945 --> 02:37:26.727]  We have to stop submitting.
[02:37:26.727 --> 02:37:29.349]  Stop turning over to it.
[02:37:29.349 --> 02:37:29.930]  Yes, sir.
[02:37:29.930 --> 02:37:34.814]  Now, two days from now is the one year anniversary of my father's death, okay?
[02:37:35.464 --> 02:37:39.787]  Now, I have a sister who is under demonic possession.
[02:37:39.787 --> 02:37:47.233]  My father suffered for exactly 28 weeks and two days, and I know that number because that's another story.
[02:37:47.233 --> 02:37:49.535]  We can get into it, God willing, one time.
[02:37:49.535 --> 02:37:56.660]  But everything I've saw during my father's suffering is going on right now in the world.
[02:37:56.660 --> 02:37:57.401]  Now, you're right.
[02:37:57.401 --> 02:37:58.862]  As above, so below, Carlos.
[02:37:58.862 --> 02:37:59.462]  God bless you.
[02:37:59.462 --> 02:38:00.943]  I appreciate your call, man.
[02:38:00.943 --> 02:38:02.505]  All right, Nick in California.
[02:38:02.505 --> 02:38:03.665]  Another call from California.
[02:38:03.665 --> 02:38:04.126]  Go ahead, Nick.
[02:38:05.327 --> 02:38:06.188]  Hi, this is Nick.
[02:38:06.188 --> 02:38:09.470]  I was calling about the hospitals and how they're slow.
[02:38:09.470 --> 02:38:10.870]  Yeah, we're not screening your call right now.
[02:38:10.870 --> 02:38:11.631]  You're live on air.
[02:38:11.631 --> 02:38:14.012]  So yeah, the hospitals are basically empty.
[02:38:14.012 --> 02:38:15.493]  They admit that.
[02:38:15.493 --> 02:38:16.674]  They said it was hoax videos.
[02:38:16.674 --> 02:38:17.374]  It's all admitted now.
[02:38:17.374 --> 02:38:18.155]  It's all big hoax.
[02:38:18.155 --> 02:38:19.335]  Yeah.
[02:38:19.335 --> 02:38:21.977]  I'm a maintenance guy and I worked at Queen Valley Medical in Napa.
[02:38:21.977 --> 02:38:23.938]  They were as slow as could be.
[02:38:23.938 --> 02:38:28.041]  And then I called Sutter Medical in Sacramento and asked them how many COVID patients they had.
[02:38:28.041 --> 02:38:30.082]  They said they had six and I was working on the COVID floor.
[02:38:30.771 --> 02:38:35.556]  And not only a third of the people there with the staff are wearing masks around the COVID patient.
[02:38:35.556 --> 02:38:36.957]  Sure, because they know it's a hoax.
[02:38:36.957 --> 02:38:39.120]  They know it's the common cult.
[02:38:39.120 --> 02:38:40.601]  Yeah, and it's just a hoax.
[02:38:40.601 --> 02:38:44.986]  And I have maintenance sheets to prove that I worked at these hospitals like Walnut Creek.
[02:38:44.986 --> 02:38:48.950]  Brother, that's the good news is you don't have to get in trouble to tell the truth now.
[02:38:48.950 --> 02:38:50.311]  It's like they're empty.
[02:38:50.311 --> 02:38:50.772]  It's come out.
[02:38:51.721 --> 02:39:01.344]  Well, the thing is, I asked about John Muir Medical, and Walnut Creek and I was threatened to be kicked off the job, and they kicked an elevator guy off the job for asking about COVID, because now they're hushing it up, and that was just yesterday, about how many they have.
[02:39:01.344 --> 02:39:04.686]  Well, that's because they get 40, and it's not Trump's fault, but he needs to be informed now.
[02:39:04.686 --> 02:39:06.586]  There should be criminal investigations.
[02:39:06.586 --> 02:39:10.328]  They get 4,000 for regular federal stuff, 40,000 for COVID.
[02:39:10.328 --> 02:39:13.909]  They incentivized it to create the illusion of COVID.
[02:39:15.560 --> 02:39:18.323]  And people say, why is it a bioweapon then?
[02:39:18.323 --> 02:39:20.484]  Because Bill and Melinda Gates own it.
[02:39:20.484 --> 02:39:22.486]  It's synthetic because they have to own it.
[02:39:22.486 --> 02:39:24.227]  You understand?
[02:39:24.227 --> 02:39:25.208]  Yes.
[02:39:25.208 --> 02:39:27.510]  And I have one more thing to address the President real quick.
[02:39:27.510 --> 02:39:29.131]  Yeah, go ahead.
[02:39:29.131 --> 02:39:33.254]  I have a patent for devices that reflect better, temporary devices.
[02:39:33.254 --> 02:39:36.216]  And you remember the gas can with the gas nozzle that you said doesn't work?
[02:39:36.216 --> 02:39:42.121]  These devices work that will save lives and we can bring back manufacturing just on this one first step to a thousand mile march.
[02:39:42.642 --> 02:39:48.025]  To bring back temporary devices, I emailed him with Nick Mattia on his White House email several times.
[02:39:48.025 --> 02:39:50.487]  Alright, send me the information.
[02:39:50.487 --> 02:39:52.228]  God bless you, brother.
[02:39:52.228 --> 02:39:56.010]  Alright, let's uh, I'm glad folks are calling in trying to get ahold of Trump.
[02:39:56.010 --> 02:39:57.350]  Because you can't get ahold of Trump.
[02:39:57.350 --> 02:39:58.551]  You just might have to try a hundred times.
[02:39:58.551 --> 02:40:02.674]  They're trying to catch that big basket.
[02:40:02.674 --> 02:40:05.095]  Now, I can do it two or three times to get the president.
[02:40:05.095 --> 02:40:06.136]  It's kind of like scary though.
[02:40:06.136 --> 02:40:07.136]  I'm going to throw this line in.
[02:40:07.136 --> 02:40:07.756]  I got a president.
[02:40:09.224 --> 02:40:10.944]  Hey Alex, nice to talk to you, man.
[02:40:10.944 --> 02:40:13.025]  Well, I just wanted to test what you said.
[02:40:13.025 --> 02:40:17.565]  I can always consider myself a true patriot, but I really didn't give a crap what the hell was going on until I had a daughter.
[02:40:39.193 --> 02:40:43.817]  And, uh, you know, I just want to say, you know, everything you say about your kids and your daughters, man, it's true.
[02:40:43.817 --> 02:40:52.205]  Um, but real quick, um, I work in the food industry, um, not in the processing, but in the production part.
[02:40:52.205 --> 02:40:57.629]  Uh, all of our machines go to Tyson, Smithfield, Purdue, uh, all the, all the big names.
[02:40:57.629 --> 02:40:58.630]  There's only Fargo.
[02:40:58.630 --> 02:41:01.873]  They're all trying to shut things down on purpose.
[02:41:01.873 --> 02:41:04.495]  What are you saying?
[02:41:04.495 --> 02:41:06.257]  From the front lines, uh, we have,
[02:41:06.829 --> 02:41:09.952]  Multiple machines not going to Tyson.
[02:41:09.952 --> 02:41:12.194]  We have multiple machines not going to Purdue.
[02:41:12.194 --> 02:41:18.300]  We had to lay off half of our staff here because the work is not here and any work that is being done it is
[02:41:19.375 --> 02:41:21.035]  Um, outsourced.
[02:41:21.035 --> 02:41:23.316]  A lot of work from China coming over.
[02:41:23.316 --> 02:41:26.637]  Um, it's really... Well, that's exactly what we broke down, Amanda.
[02:41:26.637 --> 02:41:27.497]  Exactly.
[02:41:27.497 --> 02:41:28.997]  So it's just a shutdown of America.
[02:41:28.997 --> 02:41:33.478]  It's like, American industry shut down, China's open.
[02:41:33.478 --> 02:41:35.979]  The big corporations said, hey, we've invested in China.
[02:41:35.979 --> 02:41:38.140]  We've got to deal with them.
[02:41:38.140 --> 02:41:41.180]  Americans are getting up and saying, hey, don't worry, we'll shut them down.
[02:41:41.180 --> 02:41:42.301]  And China's open.
[02:41:42.301 --> 02:41:43.941]  How diabolical is that, brother?
[02:41:45.760 --> 02:41:48.282]  It's sad.
[02:41:48.282 --> 02:41:50.263]  But you're personally witnessing this.
[02:41:50.263 --> 02:41:54.346]  Because what you're saying is confirmed in the news that China is shipping everything into us now.
[02:41:54.346 --> 02:42:00.070]  Our chicken, our poultry, our beef, our pork.
[02:42:00.070 --> 02:42:02.612]  This is a total setup.
[02:42:02.612 --> 02:42:02.932]  Everything.
[02:42:02.932 --> 02:42:04.073]  Let me tell you something here.
[02:42:04.073 --> 02:42:11.919]  No matter what your political view is here at this plant, what God you pray to, everybody sees it and everybody knows what's going on.
[02:42:11.919 --> 02:42:13.440]  It's good to see people are realizing it.
[02:42:14.319 --> 02:42:15.120]  Mike, don't hang up.
[02:42:15.120 --> 02:42:16.441]  I'm going to come back to you after breaking.
[02:42:16.441 --> 02:42:25.909]  You'll be part of the next segment because I've got all the articles here that the poultry, the pork, the beef, the fisheries, they're all shutting down.
[02:42:25.909 --> 02:42:27.111]  But don't worry.
[02:42:27.111 --> 02:42:29.152]  They're shipping beef in from Africa.
[02:42:29.152 --> 02:42:31.154]  We've never taken beef from Africa.
[02:42:31.154 --> 02:42:32.856]  Beef from South America.
[02:42:32.856 --> 02:42:34.137]  Beef from Central America.
[02:42:34.137 --> 02:42:36.299]  Beef from Asia.
[02:42:36.299 --> 02:42:37.239]  Because we're shut down.
[02:42:37.239 --> 02:42:39.642]  They're like, Trump, you think you're opening America up?
[02:42:40.424 --> 02:42:41.646]  Watch this, bitch.
[02:42:41.646 --> 02:42:42.908]  We gonna shut your ass down.
[02:42:42.908 --> 02:42:43.790]  They did it.
[02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:46.595]  You like being gang-raped like this?
[02:42:46.595 --> 02:42:52.445]  Let me tell you, everybody involved in this should have a trial, and then I'll pull the lever to hang their ass.
[02:42:53.991 --> 02:42:55.813]  How do you put a people under house arrest?
[02:42:55.813 --> 02:42:57.816]  How do you put them under siege?
[02:42:57.816 --> 02:43:11.553]  Well, you tell them you're protecting them from a virus that you yourself cooked up with the globalist Deep State and then had China release to then take down the populist president and those pesky American people that have become too uppity.
[02:43:12.352 --> 02:43:13.693]  Bill Maher even admitted it.
[02:43:13.693 --> 02:43:15.554]  Man, I hope we have a depression.
[02:43:15.554 --> 02:43:30.885]  And now they've tailored the whole thing, where the big corporations and the media are going to keep the country closed, along with the help of the blue states and blue states, all the time blaming Trump and capitalism and Americanism for the depression it creates.
[02:43:30.885 --> 02:43:33.907]  If America is that stupid, we deserve what happens to us.
[02:43:33.907 --> 02:43:37.270]  But as for me, I'm not sitting here and I'm not taking it.
[02:43:37.270 --> 02:43:41.352]  It's all the nanny state and the peer pressure that they're the good people keeping everybody safe.
[02:43:42.113 --> 02:43:43.774]  But that's not what they're doing.
[02:43:43.774 --> 02:43:53.517]  They are pulling America up by its roots and irrevocably damaging our savings, our health, our whole world, and committing millions of third-world people to death.
[02:43:53.517 --> 02:43:55.878]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[02:43:55.878 --> 02:44:01.860]  They're amazing, they're cutting-edge, you love them, I love them, and they fund the InfoWar in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[02:44:01.860 --> 02:44:05.781]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development
[02:44:06.963 --> 02:44:08.604]  That is amazing.
[02:44:08.604 --> 02:44:16.268]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[02:44:16.268 --> 02:44:18.609]  And there's another innovation.
[02:44:18.609 --> 02:44:20.690]  It's the spray cap.
[02:44:20.690 --> 02:44:26.093]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality.
[02:44:26.093 --> 02:44:28.294]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[02:44:28.294 --> 02:44:29.195]  I like to put it on my hands.
[02:44:29.935 --> 02:44:31.435]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[02:44:31.435 --> 02:44:34.256]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so don't spray it right in your eyes.
[02:44:34.256 --> 02:44:38.657]  But I just love it, personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[02:44:38.657 --> 02:44:40.437]  So, this is a real innovation.
[02:44:40.437 --> 02:44:46.759]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out.
[02:44:46.759 --> 02:44:48.319]  It smells great.
[02:44:48.319 --> 02:44:50.140]  It's so refreshing.
[02:44:50.140 --> 02:44:51.000]  This is a big winner.
[02:44:54.687 --> 02:44:59.512]  Ten weeks ago, I began to tell listeners that they needed to get high quality, storable food.
[02:44:59.512 --> 02:45:10.704]  Not because of the virus, but because of the crises and the economic shutdown it would cause because the globalists were planning to hold America hostage and run a blockade through the blue cities and blue states.
[02:45:11.445 --> 02:45:15.887]  Now that prediction has come true, because the globalists are running an operation.
[02:45:15.887 --> 02:45:17.827]  It's not predictions.
[02:45:17.827 --> 02:45:20.128]  We have their battle plans.
[02:45:20.128 --> 02:45:28.391]  So, going back more than eight weeks ago, all major storable food companies were sold out, except MyPatriotSupply, because they're the biggest of a preposition.
[02:45:28.391 --> 02:45:36.414]  When it got to the point that they had so many orders coming in that they wouldn't be able to fulfill them in a timely manner, they stopped taking orders until they got caught back up.
[02:45:36.414 --> 02:45:36.554]  Well,
[02:45:37.074 --> 02:45:38.055]  Now they're caught back up.
[02:45:38.055 --> 02:45:41.857]  They've got high-quality storable food in stock, ready to be packaged and shipped to you.
[02:45:41.857 --> 02:45:50.361]  Get your orders in now at InfoWarsTore.com to go right at the head of the queue and get delivered to you as fast as possible and from the InfoWar.
[02:45:50.361 --> 02:45:52.843]  Get your storable food now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:45:53.985 --> 02:46:01.729]  It's been sold out for more than four months, but our best-selling vitamin D3 and vitamin K formula is back in stock.
[02:46:01.729 --> 02:46:03.610]  Winter sun.
[02:46:03.610 --> 02:46:10.734]  In the fall, in the winter, as you know, your body, when you're not getting sunlight on the skin, does not produce vitamin D3.
[02:46:10.734 --> 02:46:12.875]  So it's important to ingest it.
[02:46:12.875 --> 02:46:15.996]  But a lot of people do not absorb it well in the gut.
[02:46:15.996 --> 02:46:22.620]  So you take this formula under the tongue, it tastes sweet naturally, let it sit there about 30 seconds to a minute,
[02:46:23.120 --> 02:46:27.003]  And then you swallow the rest, and it's just amazing.
[02:46:27.003 --> 02:46:33.689]  It's back in stock, and yes, we're going to offer it at 50% off, because that's the right thing to do during this crisis.
[02:46:33.689 --> 02:46:35.590]  So, Winter Sun, 50% off.
[02:46:35.590 --> 02:46:39.373]  We also have Ultra 12, highest quality, B12.
[02:46:39.373 --> 02:46:42.836]  It is also available, take it out of the tongue, 50% off.
[02:46:42.836 --> 02:46:44.637]  InfoWarsTore.com, and we have X3.
[02:46:44.637 --> 02:46:51.383]  Even though it's going to sell out, super high quality, deep earth iodine, it is 60% off, because I want you to have it right now.
[02:46:51.383 --> 02:46:52.404]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:46:57.307 --> 02:47:13.258]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:13.258 --> 02:47:15.299]  I remember.
[02:47:15.299 --> 02:47:20.002]  A long time ago.
[02:47:20.002 --> 02:47:22.304]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[02:47:22.304 --> 02:47:24.786]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[02:47:24.786 --> 02:47:26.247]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:32.130 --> 02:47:49.039]  But memory is individualism.
[02:47:49.039 --> 02:47:53.962]  I saw the lay of the land a long time ago.
[02:47:53.962 --> 02:47:58.224]  But I didn't realize what happened after you went over the mountains.
[02:48:03.114 --> 02:48:07.757]  I've gone over the mountains.
[02:48:07.757 --> 02:48:11.919]  And I can tell you, it's just what you got told.
[02:48:11.919 --> 02:48:12.700]  Bible's dead on.
[02:48:12.700 --> 02:48:20.044]  In fact, it's so dead on, it's unbelievable they'd be given something like that to warn us, but why not?
[02:48:20.044 --> 02:48:26.728]  God gives us free will, but then God feels so guilty putting His children into something like this.
[02:48:26.728 --> 02:48:28.549]  It just hopes we're there on the other side.
[02:48:29.721 --> 02:48:31.601]  But I understand the purity of it.
[02:48:31.601 --> 02:48:39.063]  You can't give people power and the keys to the universe without allowing them to be tested.
[02:48:39.063 --> 02:48:45.524]  I want to finish up with some phone calls here before Paul Watson takes over.
[02:48:45.524 --> 02:48:47.845]  But look at this headline.
[02:48:47.845 --> 02:48:54.206]  UN chief says pandemic must be used to de-industrialize the West.
[02:48:54.206 --> 02:48:57.787]  When you see words like de-industrialize, think billions dead.
[02:49:02.168 --> 02:49:04.969]  That's what that means.
[02:49:04.969 --> 02:49:07.609]  And look at this old boy, if you're a TV viewer.
[02:49:07.609 --> 02:49:09.810]  Does he look like anybody you trust?
[02:49:09.810 --> 02:49:12.271]  Does he look like he's gonna build a planet?
[02:49:12.271 --> 02:49:18.212]  No, he looks like he's a follower, doesn't he?
[02:49:18.212 --> 02:49:26.394]  We have a rare and short window of opportunity to rebuild our world for the better by killing everybody.
[02:49:26.394 --> 02:49:29.655]  Carbon is what makes the plant and animals live.
[02:49:30.879 --> 02:49:40.484]  But they teach you that that's a problem, but their 5G, their genetic engineering, their wars, their uranium plants are good.
[02:49:40.484 --> 02:49:46.608]  These are sick people.
[02:49:46.608 --> 02:49:52.451]  But see, they don't have an energy, so they attract evil.
[02:49:52.451 --> 02:49:55.512]  So we wonder like, why are all these powerful people attracted to evil?
[02:49:55.512 --> 02:49:56.173]  They're not powerful.
[02:49:57.304 --> 02:50:05.510]  They just coalesce at one point because good people are all like free and like don't want power because you already have the power.
[02:50:05.510 --> 02:50:14.297]  Somebody connected to God doesn't want power because you've already got all the power.
[02:50:14.297 --> 02:50:17.059]  You don't look for something you already have.
[02:50:17.059 --> 02:50:22.844]  Like if you got plenty of water in the desert, you're like not looking for water because you're not thirsty.
[02:50:22.844 --> 02:50:26.546]  The people that want power are looking for it because they don't got it.
[02:50:26.546 --> 02:50:26.727]  I mean,
[02:50:27.867 --> 02:50:30.028]  The old joke is Alex Jones says I'm a braggart.
[02:50:30.028 --> 02:50:30.989]  Look, I'm not braggart.
[02:50:30.989 --> 02:50:32.389]  I got plenty of power.
[02:50:32.389 --> 02:50:34.331]  I wanted to be nasty and manipulate stuff.
[02:50:34.331 --> 02:50:38.453]  I wanted to kill somebody or beat their ass or do a business deal.
[02:50:38.453 --> 02:50:39.033]  I can do it.
[02:50:39.033 --> 02:50:40.234]  I know how to do it.
[02:50:40.234 --> 02:50:46.177]  But because I've got the power, I'm not trying to screw people over because I already got it.
[02:50:46.177 --> 02:50:53.881]  That's why you gotta learn the people that you think you can trust because you're trying to build them up.
[02:50:53.881 --> 02:50:55.142]  A lot of times they're the biggest problem.
[02:50:56.089 --> 02:51:03.274]  Because then they get in the power structure, they try to cut you out of things because you're actually trying to build people up and they don't want that.
[02:51:03.274 --> 02:51:06.776]  They don't, they're not in power when they see other people doing good.
[02:51:06.776 --> 02:51:10.919]  I've been around so many executives and they go, you pay your employees this much?
[02:51:10.919 --> 02:51:11.620]  No one does that.
[02:51:11.620 --> 02:51:13.441]  Not even in Los Angeles.
[02:51:13.441 --> 02:51:14.622]  Are you crazy?
[02:51:14.622 --> 02:51:16.143]  Well, no, I want them to have good lives.
[02:51:16.143 --> 02:51:18.084]  They don't care about you.
[02:51:18.084 --> 02:51:20.926]  Well, whatever, I metaphysically think that's how I treat my people.
[02:51:22.446 --> 02:51:29.950]  So like in most management, there's this elitism that you put people down, you get more powerful.
[02:51:29.950 --> 02:51:33.953]  Instead of, I'm already so powerful, I'm going to raise everybody up.
[02:51:33.953 --> 02:51:38.415]  But see, between those two points is where you find reality.
[02:51:38.415 --> 02:51:49.202]  Because you can look at both views, but the view that people are crap to be used and can't be trusted, well, you build what you just were trying to get away from.
[02:51:50.814 --> 02:51:53.835]  So I'll take a few calls in this segment and the next.
[02:51:53.835 --> 02:51:55.155]  Let's go ahead and go to Mike in Florida.
[02:51:55.155 --> 02:51:55.836]  Mike, you're on the air.
[02:51:55.836 --> 02:51:58.917]  Thanks for rolling.
[02:51:58.917 --> 02:52:01.758]  Thanks again for having me hold on over the break.
[02:52:01.758 --> 02:52:02.558]  I appreciate you.
[02:52:02.558 --> 02:52:03.498]  Go ahead and finish your point.
[02:52:03.498 --> 02:52:10.041]  You're a food industry worker and you're in the food supply chain and what you're witnessing?
[02:52:10.041 --> 02:52:12.121]  Complete crumble.
[02:52:12.121 --> 02:52:17.143]  Not to go off of what you say, man, but it's collapsing right in front of my eyes very slowly.
[02:52:17.811 --> 02:52:19.172]  Uh, which I think is intentional.
[02:52:19.172 --> 02:52:20.772]  Well, it took a long time to build it.
[02:52:20.772 --> 02:52:23.314]  Takes a long time to kill it.
[02:52:23.314 --> 02:52:27.936]  Yes, and I, you know, particularly work in the logistics part of it.
[02:52:27.936 --> 02:52:35.319]  And, uh, you know, the truck drivers I talked to, UPS, FedEx, um, man, they got no packages on their trucks.
[02:52:35.319 --> 02:52:38.020]  They don't know whether they're going to come back the next day or what.
[02:52:38.020 --> 02:52:39.021]  Well, see, that's because...
[02:52:40.276 --> 02:52:41.577]  That economy's still there.
[02:52:41.577 --> 02:52:48.362]  They're gonna come in with their corporate bailout, but see, to get the money, the taxpayer money, you've gotta have the globalists running it.
[02:52:48.362 --> 02:52:51.504]  So they already, with their AI, scanned the networks.
[02:52:51.504 --> 02:52:53.746]  They're just banning the networks they don't control.
[02:52:53.746 --> 02:52:56.428]  See how that works?
[02:52:56.428 --> 02:52:59.370]  Yes, they do.
[02:52:59.370 --> 02:53:01.191]  But you said something really important.
[02:53:01.191 --> 02:53:06.455]  You said, left or right, everybody knows it, don't they?
[02:53:06.455 --> 02:53:09.257]  I work black, white, Asians,
[02:53:11.256 --> 02:53:12.197]  I work with everybody.
[02:53:12.197 --> 02:53:14.279]  This is a very liberal company.
[02:53:14.279 --> 02:53:22.565]  I work with women, men, there's a bunch of people in this plant and everybody sees it.
[02:53:22.565 --> 02:53:29.911]  When those conversations get brought up... So they need to remember, Mike, who did this to them.
[02:53:31.218 --> 02:53:31.378]  Yes.
[02:53:31.378 --> 02:53:33.078]  Yeah, I try to spread the word, man.
[02:53:33.078 --> 02:53:36.459]  But, you know, like a lot of your callers say, man, how do you wake people up?
[02:53:36.459 --> 02:53:38.180]  You know, sometimes it seems like
[02:53:54.887 --> 02:54:01.810]  It just needs to happen for people to wake the hell up because, you know, the amazing job you're doing, man, it's not reaching everybody.
[02:54:01.810 --> 02:54:02.710]  It's not your fault.
[02:54:02.710 --> 02:54:04.291]  People want to resist it.
[02:54:04.291 --> 02:54:06.752]  They can't handle it.
[02:54:06.752 --> 02:54:11.573]  But you said in general that they get that it's a screw job.
[02:54:11.573 --> 02:54:12.114]  They get it.
[02:54:12.114 --> 02:54:13.254]  They get it.
[02:54:13.254 --> 02:54:20.417]  You know, when we found out Smithfield was bought by China, you know, there's a good amount of people saying we're going to walk the hell out of here.
[02:54:22.250 --> 02:54:27.457]  You know, it ain't right they're taking advantage of when everyone's down because everybody's getting impacted from this weather.
[02:54:27.457 --> 02:54:31.703]  Oh yeah, remember it's not even a Chinese takeover, it's a globalist takeover.
[02:54:31.703 --> 02:54:34.607]  God bless you, brother.
[02:54:34.607 --> 02:54:36.789]  The average American wants to lazily go in.
[02:54:38.303 --> 02:54:49.209]  And buy a side of pork or a side of beef when before it would take years of feeding a cow and years of having a breed and have an extra cow you could eat.
[02:54:49.209 --> 02:54:56.233]  It was like a big deal like and every piece of meat you enjoyed every but now it's like off whatever.
[02:54:56.233 --> 02:54:58.054]  So now they don't care where it comes from.
[02:54:58.054 --> 02:55:01.035]  So they lose their soul.
[02:55:01.035 --> 02:55:02.556]  Sunny in Indiana.
[02:55:02.556 --> 02:55:04.017]  Sunny thanks for holding her on the air.
[02:55:04.017 --> 02:55:06.058]  Go ahead.
[02:55:06.058 --> 02:55:06.518]  Hi Alex.
[02:55:08.532 --> 02:55:15.498]  God bless you and your crew and their families and all the Patriots out there that have been listening to you and saw this all coming.
[02:55:15.498 --> 02:55:18.980]  God bless you, son.
[02:55:18.980 --> 02:55:28.848]  I just wanted to kind of point out some of the things that had taken place as far as the Chinese takeover in our country for a long time.
[02:55:28.848 --> 02:55:31.570]  They owned all of the entertainment.
[02:55:31.570 --> 02:55:36.534]  Like, they've been putting us all into a comatose state for decades.
[02:55:37.908 --> 02:55:43.372]  And then another part of that is something that I read a while back about the governor.
[02:55:43.372 --> 02:55:44.553]  There was a U.S.
[02:55:44.553 --> 02:55:46.995]  governor's conference in Louisville, Kentucky.
[02:56:08.687 --> 02:56:13.612]  And that was last Memorial Day weekend, 2019.
[02:56:13.612 --> 02:56:19.817]  And I am working shortly after that.
[02:56:19.817 --> 02:56:33.389]  There was another thing that came up from Pompeo in February of this year that warned the governors that China was basically keeping tabs on them.
[02:56:33.389 --> 02:56:35.551]  Well, no, they actually bought off most of the governors, yeah.
[02:56:37.426 --> 02:56:38.847]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:56:38.847 --> 02:56:40.708]  Here's the thing, Sunny.
[02:56:40.708 --> 02:56:41.769]  You're upset.
[02:56:41.769 --> 02:56:43.830]  That's a normal thing.
[02:56:43.830 --> 02:56:45.951]  So you're an early warning system.
[02:56:45.951 --> 02:56:46.932]  You care.
[02:56:46.932 --> 02:56:47.832]  So you're upset.
[02:56:47.832 --> 02:56:49.633]  I don't want you to be on the same way.
[02:56:49.633 --> 02:56:52.415]  But that strength, your voice trimulating.
[02:56:54.656 --> 02:56:58.318]  That's like the alarm, like a woman concerned is like powerful.
[02:56:58.318 --> 02:57:02.760]  Like I just feel powerful hearing your voice, concerned.
[02:57:02.760 --> 02:57:08.183]  That's like a bell that you ring that, Sonny, the men will respond.
[02:57:08.183 --> 02:57:09.403]  Do you see that?
[02:57:09.403 --> 02:57:10.564]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:57:10.564 --> 02:57:12.245]  Yeah, I feel it.
[02:57:12.245 --> 02:57:14.306]  And it's good.
[02:57:14.306 --> 02:57:18.668]  And you, you know, you post stuff and try and reach out to people, but
[02:57:19.449 --> 02:57:25.732]  Ultimately, it's going to be them and God that comes to terms with what's really happening.
[02:57:25.732 --> 02:57:28.273]  Nobody else can open their eyes to that.
[02:57:28.273 --> 02:57:29.074]  You're right, Sunny.
[02:57:29.074 --> 02:57:30.374]  You just said it.
[02:57:30.374 --> 02:57:31.134]  Beautifully said.
[02:57:31.134 --> 02:57:39.398]  Jeff, Brendan, Mike, final calls before Paul Joseph Watson takes over.
[02:57:39.398 --> 02:57:40.599]  This is the InfoWar.
[02:57:43.715 --> 02:57:47.383]  Look, the globalists are satanists, alright?
[02:57:47.383 --> 02:57:54.178]  Lord Rothschild recently posed at a gallery of art worshipping the devil and praising Lucifer.
[02:57:55.051 --> 02:57:56.712]  You cannot make this up.
[02:57:56.712 --> 02:57:58.293]  They flaunt it in our face.
[02:57:58.293 --> 02:57:59.634]  That's what environmentalism is.
[02:57:59.634 --> 02:58:05.298]  It's about having an anti-human future and having people live in a subsistence, feudal, serf state.
[02:58:05.298 --> 02:58:06.559]  That's what they want.
[02:58:06.559 --> 02:58:12.203]  These people that have stolen the planet and are worth trillions of dollars do not want you having a good life.
[02:58:12.203 --> 02:58:13.904]  They know you're having fun.
[02:58:13.904 --> 02:58:16.746]  They know you have a great wife, a great husband, great children.
[02:58:16.746 --> 02:58:18.046]  They hate your guts.
[02:58:18.046 --> 02:58:21.449]  They are the most horrible, evil people on the planet.
[02:58:21.449 --> 02:58:23.070]  They openly fund racism.
[02:58:23.510 --> 02:58:27.114]  War, degeneracy, pedophilia, everything else.
[02:58:27.114 --> 02:58:32.059]  Imagine the most horrible thing in the universe and then imagine it doubled, tripled, quadrupled.
[02:58:32.059 --> 02:58:36.964]  And being gullible and being domesticated just makes them rise up and attack you harder.
[02:58:36.964 --> 02:58:42.751]  And they're the ones that launched this whole attack on the planet and they are the enemy of humanity and need to be stood up against.
[02:58:44.591 --> 02:58:46.773]  The official numbers are now in.
[02:58:46.773 --> 02:58:51.496]  The United States is in the biggest financial collapse in our history.
[02:58:51.496 --> 02:58:53.718]  This is the worst employment collapse in U.S.
[02:58:53.718 --> 02:58:58.641]  history by a very wide margin, writes Michael Snyder, Economic Collapse Blog.
[02:58:58.641 --> 02:59:04.445]  At this point, we should no longer speak of economic collapse as something that will happen in the future.
[02:59:04.445 --> 02:59:05.846]  It is now here.
[02:59:05.846 --> 02:59:10.670]  And he does an excellent job in the article on Infowars.com of laying it out.
[02:59:10.970 --> 02:59:13.311]  This was done by design.
[02:59:13.311 --> 02:59:25.456]  Trump fought to open the economy, but the hijacked blue cities and states with the Chi-Coms and with Hollywood and the media held America underwater until we sucked it into our lungs.
[02:59:25.456 --> 02:59:28.977]  And now we're lying there like a fish dying.
[02:59:28.977 --> 02:59:30.858]  There's not much time to get the water out of our lungs.
[02:59:31.178 --> 02:59:39.261]  So remember, for decades to come, when millions starve to death worldwide and you live in slums with no medicine, the globalists did this!
[02:59:39.261 --> 02:59:40.941]  The globalists did this!
[02:59:40.941 --> 02:59:42.442]  The globalists did this!
[02:59:42.442 --> 02:59:48.284]  The globalists did this!
[02:59:48.284 --> 02:59:50.885]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[02:59:56.968 --> 03:00:12.639]  Alright, I've got to jam in three colors before this segment ends and Paul Watson takes over.
[03:00:12.639 --> 03:00:17.182]  Let's talk to Jeff in Missouri.
[03:00:17.182 --> 03:00:17.983]  Jeff, thanks for holding.
[03:00:17.983 --> 03:00:18.323]  Go ahead.
[03:00:19.827 --> 03:00:26.010]  Yeah, Alex, I'm going to talk about fathers and children and that beautiful book called the Bible.
[03:00:26.010 --> 03:00:32.372]  I would like to read, because this is really on point, and it's going to give every father his marching order.
[03:00:32.372 --> 03:00:36.494]  Exodus chapter 22, verses 22, 23, and 24.
[03:00:36.494 --> 03:00:47.599]  Ye shall not afflict any fatherless child, if thou afflict them in any way
[03:00:48.519 --> 03:00:53.282]  And they cry at all unto me.
[03:00:53.282 --> 03:01:02.268]  I will surely hear their cry, and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will kill you.
[03:01:02.268 --> 03:01:04.529]  It is the most beautiful piece of scripture.
[03:01:04.529 --> 03:01:05.990]  I love it.
[03:01:05.990 --> 03:01:07.231]  No, it's true.
[03:01:07.231 --> 03:01:10.913]  We call on God, Gobble, but that's the pure of heart.
[03:01:10.913 --> 03:01:12.314]  You're absolutely right.
[03:01:12.314 --> 03:01:15.036]  Otherless children, and that's an important point.
[03:01:15.612 --> 03:01:21.993]  Now, you've been demonstrating a lot of anxiety about the possibility of your children becoming fatherless soon.
[03:01:21.993 --> 03:01:23.674]  Now, I have the same anxiety.
[03:01:23.674 --> 03:01:24.774]  I have three young children.
[03:01:24.774 --> 03:01:25.874]  I'm a single parent.
[03:01:25.874 --> 03:01:30.015]  I'm 64 years old, visually impaired, and I have three young children here.
[03:01:30.015 --> 03:01:41.077]  Now, I teach my children every day that should something happen to me, I'm still able to protect them, and that when they cry out, they cry out to me, their earthly father, and my duty is to protect them.
[03:01:43.211 --> 03:01:53.822]  When they become fatherless, I teach them every day, cry out to Jesus if you get into a tough spot, if I'm not here, if I'm gone, cry unto God, unto Jesus.
[03:01:53.822 --> 03:01:58.766]  He will hear and He will kill those who are afflicting you.
[03:01:58.766 --> 03:02:01.729]  It's important to look carefully at this verse.
[03:02:01.729 --> 03:02:04.612]  Now, I want to turn to the French Revolution real quick.
[03:02:04.612 --> 03:02:07.315]  In the decades leading up to the French Revolution,
[03:02:08.024 --> 03:02:15.649]  Children are being swept off the streets of Paris and disappeared into the aristocracy and the royalty and they're being used for their purposes.
[03:02:15.649 --> 03:02:19.531]  Their blood was very valued and all that goes with child abduction.
[03:02:19.531 --> 03:02:25.154]  And satanists, which is what the royalty and aristocracy had become in France.
[03:02:25.154 --> 03:02:35.040]  Now, they were picking up the orphans on the street and the urchins and that kind of thing, but when they ran short of children on the street, the police, they were doing all the child confiscation.
[03:02:35.040 --> 03:02:36.421]  When they ran short on children,
[03:02:36.894 --> 03:02:41.376]  They began taking children who had fathers who were working and mothers in intact homes.
[03:02:41.376 --> 03:02:43.177]  They started taking those children.
[03:02:43.177 --> 03:02:48.700]  When the fathers tried to intervene, they were arrested and hung for getting in the way.
[03:02:48.700 --> 03:02:55.243]  Now, so I'm telling you, if you try to get in the way and protect your children, you may just leave your children fatherless.
[03:02:55.243 --> 03:02:57.264]  But then we have the victory.
[03:02:57.264 --> 03:03:06.089]  When those children cry unto Jesus, it says right here, I will hear my rash of wax hot and I will kill you, meaning the one who is afflicting.
[03:03:07.082 --> 03:03:21.291]  This is an important verse, and every man now with children, as their marching orders, teach your children that if you are, if they become fatherless, that they are to cry unto Jesus, but they must be told that now.
[03:03:21.291 --> 03:03:34.900]  One other thing about women getting involved, the French had spies all over the place around Paris, and there's a quote from a lawyer's diary here, our women, meaning the ordinary French woman, our women
[03:03:36.533 --> 03:03:38.074]  We'll go to Versailles.
[03:03:38.074 --> 03:03:39.234]  This is what the women were saying.
[03:03:39.234 --> 03:03:40.535]  The spies are picking it up.
[03:03:40.535 --> 03:03:49.939]  Our women will go to Versailles to dethrone the king and tear his eyes out.
[03:03:49.939 --> 03:03:53.140]  Okay, that's women getting, you know, involved there.
[03:03:53.829 --> 03:03:58.292]  Anyway, Alex, I've said a piece here, and I'm... No, it's all about killing our children.
[03:03:58.292 --> 03:04:04.815]  It's all about a satanic energy attacking the human operation, and people better decide which side they're on.
[03:04:04.815 --> 03:04:05.736]  God bless you.
[03:04:05.736 --> 03:04:07.397]  All right, I'm sorry to Brendan and Mike.
[03:04:07.397 --> 03:04:07.937]  I gotta go.
[03:04:07.937 --> 03:04:12.440]  If you give their name and number, we'll call them back tomorrow, and I'd appreciate you to come on the show then.
[03:04:12.440 --> 03:04:14.801]  And we fund ourselves the products at Enforceware.com.
[03:04:14.801 --> 03:04:16.162]  We want you to stay here and get them.
[03:04:16.162 --> 03:04:17.002]  Plus, they're great products.
[03:04:17.002 --> 03:04:18.583]  Who knows how long you can get them.
[03:04:18.583 --> 03:04:19.544]  So I suggest you get them.
[03:04:22.892 --> 03:04:25.473]  These are the times that try men's souls.
[03:04:25.473 --> 03:04:27.993]  This is, we're on a planet in deep space, folks.
[03:04:27.993 --> 03:04:30.094]  You don't think we just live here and like be in peace.
[03:04:30.094 --> 03:04:35.096]  No, there's bad stuff, but God's given us a way to counter it and deal with it.
[03:04:35.096 --> 03:04:40.178]  So, Paul Joseph Watson's taking over InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com.
[03:04:40.178 --> 03:04:42.019]  If you don't share those links and articles, who will?
[03:04:42.679 --> 03:04:48.881]  There's a reason YouTube banned those doctors in California talking about the COVID being an exaggerated hoax.
[03:04:48.881 --> 03:04:50.481]  This is powerful and it's true.
[03:04:50.481 --> 03:04:53.002]  Yep, videos at InfoWars.
[03:04:53.002 --> 03:04:55.123]  BioPQQ.
[03:04:55.123 --> 03:04:56.083]  Research that.
[03:04:56.083 --> 03:04:57.824]  Look into it for yourself.
[03:04:57.824 --> 03:05:00.545]  Big Brother and the globalists don't want you to.
[03:05:00.545 --> 03:05:01.205]  CoQ10.
[03:05:01.205 --> 03:05:04.766]  Oh, you probably want to spend some time researching CoQ10.
[03:05:04.766 --> 03:05:07.467]  And then research DNA Force Plus and the types.
[03:05:21.882 --> 03:05:25.944]  This is our best selling overall formula.
[03:05:25.944 --> 03:05:35.390]  And I told listeners at the end of last year that we can't sell products at 50% off anymore because there's not enough markup in them to fund our operations.
[03:05:35.390 --> 03:05:46.976]  But because of what's happening and going on in the world right now, I really want everybody who hasn't used or tried or enjoyed the benefits of DNA Force Plus to have DNA Force Plus
[03:05:55.532 --> 03:06:04.319]  You're listening to the Summit.News Radio Hour with Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:06:04.319 --> 03:06:15.927]  A lot of questions still remain about what is the new normal.
[03:06:15.927 --> 03:06:22.792]  All this social distancing, all its ups and downs, the economy, deaths in terms of poverty,
[03:06:23.379 --> 03:06:40.604]  People not being able to go into hospital to get treatment for a range of other serious illnesses aside from COVID-19, which according to some experts will actually cause more excess deaths than total COVID-19 deaths over the next five years.
[03:06:40.604 --> 03:06:44.985]  So it begs the question, why did we go through all this at all?
[03:06:45.600 --> 03:06:47.961]  The whole point was to get back to normal.
[03:06:47.961 --> 03:06:52.264]  Now they're saying you're never going to get back to the old normal.
[03:06:52.264 --> 03:06:53.925]  This is the new normal.
[03:06:53.925 --> 03:06:54.966]  What is the new normal?
[03:06:54.966 --> 03:07:00.489]  Well, very interesting article that went up on summit.news about an hour ago.
[03:07:00.489 --> 03:07:10.295]  Headline chief public health officer of Canada appeared in 2010 documentary to advocate tracking bracelets for vaccine refuseniks.
[03:07:10.295 --> 03:07:11.056]  Now we've seen the
[03:07:12.202 --> 03:07:19.444]  Rapid advancement of surveillance technology as it applies to tracking potential coronavirus sufferers.
[03:07:19.444 --> 03:07:28.127]  Of course we had the video last week of the social distancing surveillance cameras which will alert people when they're standing too close to other people.
[03:07:28.127 --> 03:07:37.910]  No doubt in the future they'll be linked in with our Chinese communist style social credit score accounts and will be punished for not socially distancing enough.
[03:07:37.910 --> 03:07:38.910]  Well over in Canada
[03:07:40.071 --> 03:07:43.152]  Canada's current Chief Public Health Officer.
[03:07:43.152 --> 03:07:46.893]  She wasn't the Chief Public Health Officer when this documentary was made.
[03:07:46.893 --> 03:07:48.493]  She is now.
[03:07:48.493 --> 03:07:55.055]  And in fact, she's the face, or at least one of the faces, of Canada's response to coronavirus.
[03:07:55.055 --> 03:07:57.455]  This is Theresa Tam.
[03:07:57.455 --> 03:08:00.816]  And I'll tell you a little bit more about her in a second.
[03:08:00.816 --> 03:08:02.316]  But this is her appearance.
[03:08:02.316 --> 03:08:04.137]  Listen very carefully to what she says.
[03:08:04.838 --> 03:08:26.504]  In a 2010 National Film Board of Canada documentary entitled Outbreak, Anatomy of a Plague, first listen to what she says about what will happen in the aftermath of a virus outbreak, specifically in terms of to people who refuse a vaccine, then listen to the context of what happens to people after that.
[03:08:26.504 --> 03:08:30.105]  Here's the clip from this 2010 Canadian documentary.
[03:08:31.989 --> 03:08:41.640]  I think the public has to know this is one of the worst case scenarios in terms of an infectious disease outbreak and that their cooperation is sought.
[03:08:41.640 --> 03:08:52.573]  If there are people who are non-compliant, there are definitely laws and public health powers that can quarantine people in mandatory settings.
[03:08:54.252 --> 03:08:55.032]  It's potential.
[03:08:55.032 --> 03:09:11.817]  You could track people, put bracelets on their arms, have police and other setups to ensure quarantine is undertaken.
[03:09:11.817 --> 03:09:19.599]  It is better to be preemptive and precautionary and take the heat of people thinking you might be overreactionary.
[03:09:19.599 --> 03:09:20.659]  Get ahead of the curve.
[03:09:21.746 --> 03:09:36.489]  And then think about whether you've overreacted later, but it's such a serious situation that I think decisive early action is the key.
[03:09:36.489 --> 03:09:43.530]  Police checkpoints are set up on all the bridges and everyone leaving the city is required to show proof of vaccination.
[03:09:43.530 --> 03:09:47.991]  Those who refuse to cooperate are taken away to temporary detention centers.
[03:09:54.366 --> 03:09:55.047]  Well, there you have it.
[03:09:55.047 --> 03:10:07.638]  That was from a 2010 Canadian documentary featuring Canada's current Chief Public Health Officer, Theresa Tam, saying that people will be forced to have vaccinations if they refuse them.
[03:10:07.638 --> 03:10:11.121]  They'll be tagged with electronic surveillance bracelets.
[03:10:11.121 --> 03:10:19.408]  This is the face of Canada's response to the coronavirus, which is why this clip is recircling on Twitter today.
[03:10:19.408 --> 03:10:21.870]  Another interesting thing about Theresa Tam,
[03:10:22.930 --> 03:10:52.311]  is that not only has she become the face of their coronavirus response, she's in all the adverts being played on television, the public service announcements, again encouraging social distancing, but she was one of the officials who right back at the start of this pandemic, before it was announced as a pandemic, was playing it down, which we saw in numerous other instances, of course no bigger instance than the World Health Organization itself, which God forbid any of us would criticize because that's not allowed now,
[03:10:53.234 --> 03:11:10.559]  In terms of how they downplayed the coronavirus, not only downplayed it in terms of the WHO, but conspired with China to cover it up and silence their own doctors from advising countries to close their borders weeks and weeks earlier than any of them did.
[03:11:11.542 --> 03:11:22.864]  While of course the WHO was saying, don't close your borders, don't initiate any kind of proper screening at airports, because that's stigmatisation and that might upset Chinese people.
[03:11:22.864 --> 03:11:39.467]  So again, we have an official who downplayed the severity of coronavirus, now in the aftermath of a lot of evidence that in many countries the curve has flattened, and in fact these lockdown measures now need to be ended because will eventually cause more deaths than lives saved.
[03:11:40.405 --> 03:11:58.294]  She's one of the ones exploiting the fear of coronavirus again to introduce these kind of measures, and if she talked about the kind of measures that she talked about in that 2010 documentary clip from the National Film Board of Canada, that's a very frightening prospect indeed.
[03:11:58.294 --> 03:11:58.574]  In fact,
[03:11:59.756 --> 03:12:07.318]  On April 23rd, she was appointed by Justin Trudeau, this is from the article, to be a member of the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force.
[03:12:07.318 --> 03:12:15.021]  Despite having previously asserted there was, quote, no reason to be overly concerned about coronavirus back in January.
[03:12:15.021 --> 03:12:16.141]  Why was she saying that?
[03:12:16.141 --> 03:12:21.103]  Well, why was Ted Ross of the WHO and a bunch of other health officials saying the same thing?
[03:12:21.103 --> 03:12:26.264]  Because they were amplifying Chinese Communist Party propaganda.
[03:12:26.264 --> 03:12:28.665]  They were mouthpieces for the CCP.
[03:12:29.458 --> 03:12:30.910]  Then as late as January 29th!
[03:12:32.717 --> 03:12:50.701]  Bearing in mind that we know there was human-to-human transmission of coronavirus in China back in November, and they covered it up since then, as late as January 29th, Theresa Tam, the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada, told Canadians it's going to be rare, but we're expecting cases.
[03:12:50.701 --> 03:13:00.724]  So again, she was downplaying it as late as January 29th, and yet here in this clip from 10 years ago, she's suggesting the most draconian measures imaginable.
[03:13:01.323 --> 03:13:06.178]  To stop people who, God forbid, refuse to have a vaccine.
[03:13:06.178 --> 03:13:07.824]  Now in terms of the vaccine they're saying
[03:13:09.103 --> 03:13:11.845]  80 different groups around the world are working on a vaccine.
[03:13:11.845 --> 03:13:13.666]  It's going to take a year or more.
[03:13:13.666 --> 03:13:21.550]  Of course, a lot of experts say there is no effective vaccine against any of these Covid coronavirus diseases.
[03:13:21.550 --> 03:13:24.112]  So what would be the point?
[03:13:24.112 --> 03:13:26.013]  Very interesting question.
[03:13:26.013 --> 03:13:28.334]  I haven't taken a vaccine since I was a child.
[03:13:28.334 --> 03:13:30.335]  Certainly never taken a flu vaccine.
[03:13:30.335 --> 03:13:32.096]  Not going to take one now.
[03:13:32.096 --> 03:13:33.637]  But what is the new normal?
[03:13:33.637 --> 03:13:34.638]  How's it going to play out?
[03:13:35.302 --> 03:13:38.906]  You're going to have to have the vaccine to travel across interstate lines.
[03:13:38.906 --> 03:13:41.529]  Are you going to have to have the vaccine to travel internationally?
[03:13:41.529 --> 03:13:50.259]  You're going to have to have the vaccine to even go outside to operate, to buy and sell, unless you take the mark.
[03:13:50.259 --> 03:13:55.144]  And I think the listeners of this show are very aware as to what that means.
[03:13:55.144 --> 03:13:55.625]  Meanwhile,
[03:13:56.798 --> 03:14:07.708]  Also in Canada, this just went up on Summit.News earlier too, Canadian man has quarantine fine increased to $1,255 for walking his dog.
[03:14:07.708 --> 03:14:20.981]  This is a 72-year-old man in Ontario who, again, an absolute cretin, he took his little pooch down the stairs of his apartment block to walk it outside in the parking lot
[03:14:21.542 --> 03:14:29.408]  Behind his apartment block, for 10 minutes, he goes back upstairs to his unit in his apartment block, who's waiting for him.
[03:14:29.408 --> 03:14:38.895]  Two police officers who hit him with a fine of $880 for, quote, breaching a COVID-19 safety precaution.
[03:14:38.895 --> 03:14:41.517]  But that wasn't the end of the story.
[03:14:41.517 --> 03:14:45.960]  As I articulate in this article, after a rebel media contacted Sarnia police,
[03:14:46.750 --> 03:14:49.632]  visited their headquarters in an effort to obtain a comment.
[03:14:49.632 --> 03:14:51.594]  Journalist from Rebel Media.
[03:14:51.594 --> 03:14:55.597]  But Henry received a second visit from the cops.
[03:14:55.597 --> 03:14:57.078]  He said, I had a knock on my door.
[03:14:57.078 --> 03:14:58.479]  It was a very loud knock.
[03:14:58.479 --> 03:15:02.823]  And I knew intuitively that it was the police because nobody knocks on your door that loud.
[03:15:02.823 --> 03:15:04.885]  And again, why is any of this happening?
[03:15:04.885 --> 03:15:08.888]  Because people are snitching on their neighbors, ratting them out.
[03:15:08.888 --> 03:15:14.212]  That's the kind of society that we're creating amidst this social distancing tyranny.
[03:15:15.186 --> 03:15:19.207]  One of the officers told McHenry he had good news for the 72-year-old.
[03:15:19.207 --> 03:15:22.849]  His original $880 fine had been withdrawn.
[03:15:22.849 --> 03:15:27.090]  But then sardonically, he immediately presented McHenry with a new $1,225 fine.
[03:15:30.239 --> 03:15:30.819]  We'll be back.
[03:15:51.889 --> 03:15:53.089]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:53.089 --> 03:15:57.010]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:57.010 --> 03:15:58.570]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:15:58.570 --> 03:16:01.511]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:01.511 --> 03:16:07.072]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:07.072 --> 03:16:08.272]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:08.272 --> 03:16:11.213]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:11.213 --> 03:16:13.433]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:13.433 --> 03:16:17.874]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:17.874 --> 03:16:20.175]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:22.332 --> 03:16:24.914]  This is a Corona crisis self-reliance alert.
[03:16:24.914 --> 03:16:33.441]  If you're worried about the power grid in the current crisis and want to generate your own supply of off-the-grid electrical power just in case, pay close attention.
[03:16:33.441 --> 03:16:34.442]  Here's why.
[03:16:34.442 --> 03:16:38.946]  A limited supply of solar backup generators will be available again in the next two weeks.
[03:16:39.426 --> 03:16:45.328]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical backup power when you get off the grid.
[03:16:45.328 --> 03:16:54.592]  And unlike gas generators, these solar generators run quietly, emit no fumes, and produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[03:16:54.592 --> 03:16:56.393]  Dangerous weather, social unrest,
[03:16:56.733 --> 03:17:04.560]  Or overloaded grids this summer will not be a problem if you go to my solar backup dot com and get your solar backup generator.
[03:17:04.560 --> 03:17:09.825]  We regret that supplies are limited and only available on a first come first serve basis.
[03:17:09.825 --> 03:17:12.727]  Check availability at my solar backup dot com.
[03:17:12.727 --> 03:17:15.370]  Never suffer painful power outages again.
[03:17:15.370 --> 03:17:17.612]  Go to my solar backup dot com.
[03:17:17.612 --> 03:17:19.694]  That's my solar backup dot com.
[03:17:22.122 --> 03:17:26.786]  House flies defecate every four to five minutes, spreading diseases and germs.
[03:17:26.786 --> 03:17:30.568]  Protect your food and your health with Bug Assault.

[03:17:53.251 --> 03:17:59.195]  The America that we've known and loved, the America that was the land of the free, home of the brave, is dying right now.
[03:17:59.195 --> 03:18:05.939]  And everything our enemies are doing is about domesticating us, shutting us down, and making us dependent on them.
[03:18:05.939 --> 03:18:07.981]  The food shortages have begun.
[03:18:07.981 --> 03:18:10.923]  The depression is going to be long and very, very serious.
[03:18:10.923 --> 03:18:13.024]  In fact, it's probably too late now to even turn back.
[03:18:13.024 --> 03:18:14.085]  Trump tried to stop it.
[03:18:14.645 --> 03:18:17.188]  But the mainstream media working with the shy comms blocked it.
[03:18:17.188 --> 03:18:21.712]  That's why you and myself, everybody else, has to get prepared now.
[03:18:21.712 --> 03:18:22.513]  Do not wait.
[03:18:22.513 --> 03:18:23.454]  It's not about the virus.
[03:18:23.454 --> 03:18:28.099]  It's about the economic chaos that's going to be unleashed in the next six months to a year.
[03:18:28.099 --> 03:18:30.862]  Get your high-quality, storable foods at InfoWareStore.com.
[03:18:30.862 --> 03:18:33.124]  They're available again, but for a limited time.
[03:18:33.124 --> 03:18:35.066]  The food supply is running out.
[03:18:35.066 --> 03:18:36.548]  There are major shortages.
[03:18:37.088 --> 03:18:41.990]  This is a globalist siege, a globalist lockdown, globalist terrorism.
[03:18:41.990 --> 03:18:45.252]  But we the people, the patriots, have to be prepared.
[03:18:45.252 --> 03:18:47.153]  We've already been proven right about prepping so far.
[03:18:47.153 --> 03:18:48.894]  We'll get ready to be really proven right.
[03:18:48.894 --> 03:18:51.015]  Get your storable foods now at m4wrestore.com.
[03:18:52.694 --> 03:19:06.973]  Hiding in plain view, Politico, the Associated Press, you name it, admit that a half a billion people, extra 500 million, are now at the subsistence starvation level, on top of all the millions already starving because of the global lockdown.
[03:19:07.654 --> 03:19:24.309]  That is hundreds of times worse than all the deaths in the world caused by COVID-19 and the very people that cooked it up and gave it to the CHICOMS at the World Health Organization with Bill Gates involved are now the ones running the operation to shut down society, create a depression and forcibly inoculate everybody.
[03:19:24.529 --> 03:19:25.569]  This is insane.
[03:19:25.569 --> 03:19:28.270]  Ladies and gentlemen, if they succeed, it's over.
[03:19:28.270 --> 03:19:29.731]  You need to get prepared now.
[03:19:29.731 --> 03:19:38.333]  You need to get high-quality, storable food now back in stock at InfowarStore.com and you need to get politically active and challenge this verbally everywhere.
[03:19:38.333 --> 03:19:44.595]  Big Tech is trying to censor everyone right now and bully people into saying you can't even challenge verbally social distancing.
[03:19:44.595 --> 03:19:46.596]  This is beyond 1984.
[03:19:46.596 --> 03:19:48.197]  The tyranny of the dual order is here.
[03:19:48.197 --> 03:19:50.617]  Get prepared now and spread the word of the Infowar.
[03:19:50.617 --> 03:19:52.018]  You are the Paul Reveres!
[03:19:55.695 --> 03:20:06.765]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:06.765 --> 03:20:13.792]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[03:20:15.623 --> 03:20:40.164]  Now we're going to get to Tucker Carlson's comments from last night about reopening society, trying to end this economic devastation which has already been caused by the lockdown and that is a message of great importance coming from him because again he was one of the people at the start who said no this is going to be worse than the flu and in fact reports suggest that Carlson drove to Mar-a-Lago to warn Trump
[03:20:40.720 --> 03:20:43.161]  But he wasn't taking it seriously enough.
[03:20:43.161 --> 03:20:52.684]  So when somebody like Tucker Carlson says, OK, we adhered to your lockdown for weeks and weeks and weeks, we adhered to your social distancing.
[03:20:52.684 --> 03:20:57.865]  Now the evidence suggests that that lockdown had negligible effects on the actual death rates.
[03:20:57.865 --> 03:21:02.106]  If you look at other countries which didn't lock down their entire economies.
[03:21:02.106 --> 03:21:07.648]  The fact that he's saying that makes a big deal because he didn't downplay it from the very beginning.
[03:21:07.648 --> 03:21:10.309]  So we're going to get to that clip probably in the next segment.
[03:21:11.178 --> 03:21:22.164]  But I want to go through this article from a few days ago, because this is one of the crucial underpinning reasons as to why this lockdown now needs to be eased across the world.
[03:21:22.164 --> 03:21:24.145]  It is the headline out of Summit News.
[03:21:24.145 --> 03:21:26.827]  And to make this clear, that's not total cancer deaths.
[03:21:35.291 --> 03:22:00.662]  Over the next five years it's excess cancer deaths of lives that would have been saved had these people been able to go into hospital and get cancer screenings and cancer treatment because many, many of them are not able to do that as a result primarily of fear over coronavirus and in fact government suggesting that people should not visit hospital unless basically they're about to die.
[03:22:00.662 --> 03:22:01.603]  In many cases that's
[03:22:02.358 --> 03:22:17.605]  The spirit of the message that was communicated early on, because we were told that hospitals would be completely overwhelmed by coronavirus, turns out that was not the case, at least in the United Kingdom and in fact in many of the countries.
[03:22:17.605 --> 03:22:25.588]  Now this is a professor at King's College London, Richard Sullivan, who warned that there will be more excess cancer deaths, again that's excess,
[03:22:26.556 --> 03:22:50.787]  In addition to ones that would have happened anyway over the next five years than the number of people total who will die from coronavirus in the UK due to the disruption caused by the coronavirus lockdown which is preventing cancer victims from getting treatment and only in the past couple of days in fact I think it's today or yesterday the UK government because of this debate being pushed to the forefront is finally
[03:22:51.949 --> 03:23:00.712]  Finally, now saying, yes, if you suspect you may have cancer, you need to go in immediately for a screening and you need to go in for your treatment.
[03:23:00.712 --> 03:23:08.974]  But this is a debate that was raging behind the scenes for the past couple of weeks, now with the UK government only just addressing it really publicly.
[03:23:08.974 --> 03:23:15.016]  Richard Sullivan, Professor of Cancer and Global Health and Director of the Institute of Cancer Policy, said, quote,
[03:23:15.911 --> 03:23:24.797]  The number of deaths due to the disruption of cancer services is likely to outweigh the number of deaths from coronavirus itself over the next five years.
[03:23:24.797 --> 03:23:28.240]  Again, because people are avoiding hospitals.
[03:23:28.240 --> 03:23:36.706]  They're saying, they're adhering to the advice that they should stay away, at least they have been doing over the past month, so as not to burden doctors and nurses.
[03:23:37.640 --> 03:23:43.704]  Routine cancer screenings have all but stopped and there will be a massive backlog once normality resumes.
[03:23:43.704 --> 03:23:46.546]  So even now they're telling people that they can go back in.
[03:23:46.546 --> 03:23:52.070]  The weight of the backlog is still going to delay people from getting that cancer treatment and that's going to kill people.
[03:23:53.211 --> 03:23:58.735]  He went on to say, The cessation and delay of cancer care will cause considerable avoidable suffering.
[03:23:58.735 --> 03:24:09.202]  Cancer screening services have stopped, which means we will miss our chance to catch many cancers when they are treatable and curable, such as cervical, bowel and breast.
[03:24:09.202 --> 03:24:16.106]  Again, the point is people didn't stop getting cancer treatment when the coronavirus outbreak started, but now they're not getting treatment.
[03:24:16.106 --> 03:24:19.909]  They didn't stop needing cancer treatment, but now they're not getting it.
[03:24:21.078 --> 03:24:40.948]  Daily Mail also reported some stroke and heart attack patients are routinely waiting more than two hours for an ambulance while 2,300 cancer diagnoses are being missed each week just in the UK because patients are not going to see their GP because they're not being referred for urgent tests and scans at hospitals.
[03:24:40.948 --> 03:24:49.152]  It goes on to say another 400 cancers a week are being missed because breast, cervical and bowel cancer screening has been suspended.
[03:24:49.898 --> 03:24:51.679]  So it's not like they're just not going in.
[03:24:51.679 --> 03:24:57.944]  They're being told you're not going to get this treatment because we're going to be overwhelmed.
[03:24:57.944 --> 03:24:58.844]  Overwhelmed, really.
[03:24:58.844 --> 03:25:08.111]  Four times emptier hospital beds in terms of acute hospital beds in the United Kingdom during this coronavirus outbreak.
[03:25:08.891 --> 03:25:15.515]  And that was reported by HSC, which is the authority on hospital treatment in the United Kingdom.
[03:25:15.515 --> 03:25:20.658]  So the acute hospital beds across the country are four times emptier than normal.
[03:25:20.658 --> 03:25:28.002]  The overspill hospitals, they built an overspill hospital in London, these 19-gallon hospitals, is barely being used.
[03:25:28.002 --> 03:25:33.605]  They built another overspill hospital in the North East to deal with excess coronavirus victims.
[03:25:34.272 --> 03:25:39.797]  They're now saying that not only is it not being used, it probably will never be used, and that they're going to close it down.
[03:25:39.797 --> 03:25:47.684]  And again, despite all this, the UK government has refused to even suggest when lockdown measures may end.
[03:25:47.684 --> 03:25:58.273]  They're not even having that conversation with the British public, despite other European countries having already given exact dates on when everything will open.
[03:25:58.273 --> 03:26:00.275]  Including, I know, even today in France,
[03:26:01.112 --> 03:26:05.373]  Where they're saying a lot of stuff is going to open on May 11th.
[03:26:05.373 --> 03:26:25.480]  Our government in the UK is refusing to even have that conversation about an exit strategy with the British public, despite the fact that many people are avoiding hospital for very serious illnesses, not getting treatment, and it's going to cause, according to this professor of cancer, going at much of a higher authority than that.
[03:26:26.235 --> 03:26:32.899]  Excess, more excess cancer deaths in the UK than total coronavirus deaths over the past five years.
[03:26:32.899 --> 03:26:35.760]  Now, we've had this debate about Sweden.
[03:26:35.760 --> 03:26:39.682]  Of course, Sweden, they actually made the right decision.
[03:26:39.682 --> 03:26:41.744]  Like, that's almost unprecedented.
[03:26:41.744 --> 03:26:45.986]  We're talking about Sweden making the right decision on a public policy issue
[03:26:46.641 --> 03:26:48.942]  They refused to lock down their economy.
[03:26:48.942 --> 03:26:58.028]  They did take some measures to encourage social distancing, but bars, restaurants, many of the shops remained open, at least to some extent.
[03:26:58.028 --> 03:27:09.515]  If you compare the graph of the death rates, when Sweden's lower population per capita is accounted for, Sweden has the same death rate as the UK.
[03:27:09.515 --> 03:27:11.396]  We locked down everything.
[03:27:11.396 --> 03:27:12.676]  They didn't.
[03:27:12.676 --> 03:27:15.198]  The death rate is almost exactly the same.
[03:27:15.788 --> 03:27:19.910]  You look at the graph in this article, it tracks almost exactly the same.
[03:27:19.910 --> 03:27:23.432]  Obviously, Sweden is going to get back on its feet quicker.
[03:27:23.432 --> 03:27:30.496]  People in Sweden, because their hospitals are also not overwhelmed, are able to get treatment for serious ailments.
[03:27:30.496 --> 03:27:39.822]  Heart attack victims, stroke attack victims are able to get into hospital, are able to get ambulances to a far greater degree than in England and the United Kingdom.
[03:27:39.822 --> 03:27:40.082]  And again,
[03:27:40.931 --> 03:27:46.193]  A lot of experts saying, of course, that Sweden is now way closer to herd immunity.
[03:27:46.193 --> 03:27:55.596]  Meanwhile, we're being told that we're going to have to wait, in some cases, maybe a year for this vaccine, which I'm sure is totally risk free, right?
[03:27:56.590 --> 03:28:16.617]  Before any of this is rescinded, before any of this is actually properly eased, and that the new normal will be locked down light for the next year, which will only hamstring our economy, lead to more misery, lead to more suicide, lead to more unemployment, lead to more poverty, which of course factors in and leads to more deaths.
[03:28:16.617 --> 03:28:17.818]  But at least finally,
[03:28:18.835 --> 03:28:28.201]  Over the past couple of days, the British Government has come out and said, yes, if you need urgent cancer screenings, urgent cancer treatment, you need to go into hospital.
[03:28:28.201 --> 03:28:30.243]  And they probably had to do it because of these
[03:28:31.098 --> 03:28:38.426]  TikTok videos of nurses dancing which kind of proved that the hospitals were not being overwhelmed.
[03:28:38.426 --> 03:28:41.108]  We're going to get into that in the next segment.
[03:28:41.108 --> 03:28:47.335]  We're also going to get into Tucker Carlson now saying that these lockdown measures need to end and they need to end quickly.
[03:28:47.335 --> 03:28:49.217]  Summit.News, don't go away, we'll be right back.
[03:28:51.636 --> 03:28:53.497]  Hand sanitizer is not an option.
[03:28:53.497 --> 03:28:54.698]  It's now a must have.
[03:28:54.698 --> 03:28:55.959]  But where can you find it?
[03:28:55.959 --> 03:28:58.000]  Online at 2020 safe dot net.

[03:29:53.163 --> 03:30:01.088]  Globalism is all about making the nation-state and the population itself obsolete, non-essential.
[03:30:01.088 --> 03:30:13.556]  That's why they position it with economic tariffs, taxes, and controls to where family farms and industry that's based in the United States has to shut down or be part of a large corporate conglomerate.
[03:30:13.556 --> 03:30:19.600]  That's part of making us obsolete so that as the human world is phased out,
[03:30:20.160 --> 03:30:24.442]  They can simply look at us and say, because again, you are not essential.
[03:30:24.442 --> 03:30:27.464]  That's what the robots and all of this is about.
[03:30:27.464 --> 03:30:31.626]  It's about setting it up where we're no longer in charge of our lives.
[03:30:31.626 --> 03:30:35.468]  We can be told to stay in our houses, and after all, shut up!
[03:30:35.468 --> 03:30:37.109]  This world doesn't belong to people anyways.
[03:30:37.109 --> 03:30:41.631]  It belongs to the new AI gods, the rich elitists that have merged with machines.
[03:30:41.631 --> 03:30:43.412]  Yeah, that sounds completely insane, doesn't it?
[03:30:44.215 --> 03:30:47.339]  That's actually the public plan they're pushing.
[03:30:47.339 --> 03:30:51.825]  These people are completely psychotic and make Hitler look like a choir boy.
[03:30:53.752 --> 03:30:58.975]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[03:30:58.975 --> 03:31:03.257]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[03:31:03.257 --> 03:31:07.699]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[03:31:07.699 --> 03:31:16.103]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breathe air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[03:31:16.103 --> 03:31:23.327]  Powerful, quiet, and effective, the Breathe uses a four-step purification process to help you breathe easier and cleaner.
[03:31:23.747 --> 03:31:27.349]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars.
[03:31:27.349 --> 03:31:32.671]  But the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.

[03:32:55.689 --> 03:33:05.453]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:05.453 --> 03:33:17.217]  Transmitting worldwide from the Summit.News studios in the United Kingdom, you are listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:33:17.217 --> 03:33:25.400]  Well, the head of the World Health Organization, Mr. Ted Ross, whose name is basically unpronounceable, so I'm not going to attempt to pronounce it.
[03:33:26.047 --> 03:33:29.568]  Says that the world should have listened to the W.H.O.
[03:33:29.568 --> 03:33:31.508]  Despite the fact that the W.H.O.
[03:33:31.508 --> 03:33:39.650]  for weeks on end amplified Chinese fake news propaganda that the coronavirus outbreak was really no big deal.
[03:33:39.650 --> 03:33:41.230]  Of course, now we know from U.S.
[03:33:41.230 --> 03:33:46.451]  intelligence reports that they almost certainly lied about the death toll.
[03:33:46.451 --> 03:33:49.072]  Of course, claimed it was around 3,000 deaths in China.
[03:33:49.072 --> 03:33:51.632]  It's actually probably nearer to 40,000 deaths.
[03:33:51.632 --> 03:33:53.933]  We're going to get onto that article here in a minute.
[03:33:54.833 --> 03:34:14.444]  First of all, Tucker Carlson, though, gave a great monologue on his Fox News show last night, and again, Carlson was one of the people at the start who was not downplaying coronavirus, unlike the Chinese, unlike the WHO, to the extent he drove to Mar-a-Lago to warn Trump that he was not taking it seriously enough.
[03:34:14.444 --> 03:34:20.608]  Well now, Tucker Carlson, given the death rates, given this social distancing lockdown, given the threat
[03:34:21.209 --> 03:34:30.923]  That the lockdown itself will cost more lives, more economic turmoil, more poverty, more unemployment if we don't lift it has somewhat changed his tune.
[03:34:30.923 --> 03:34:32.064]  We're going to go to that clip.
[03:34:32.064 --> 03:34:32.425]  Here it is.
[03:34:33.660 --> 03:34:37.262]  There's a physician and researcher from California called Dr. Dan Erickson.
[03:34:37.262 --> 03:34:42.746]  Erickson and a partner just delivered a 50-minute briefing on the latest numbers from California.
[03:34:42.746 --> 03:34:47.029]  The video they made has been viewed millions of times in a few days online.
[03:34:47.029 --> 03:34:54.814]  The bottom line is, after looking carefully at the data, these two researchers have concluded that California should end its shelter-in-place order.
[03:34:54.814 --> 03:34:55.615]  Watch.
[03:34:55.615 --> 03:34:56.535]  We've seen 1,227 deaths.
[03:34:59.747 --> 03:35:14.655]  In the state of California, with a possible incidence or prevalence of 4.7 million, that means you have a 0.03 chance of dying from COVID-19 in the state of California.
[03:35:14.655 --> 03:35:19.277]  0.03 chance of dying from COVID in the state of California.
[03:35:19.277 --> 03:35:22.899]  Does that necessitate sheltering in place?
[03:35:22.899 --> 03:35:26.261]  Does that necessitate shutting down medical systems?
[03:35:26.261 --> 03:35:28.602]  Does that necessitate people being out of work?
[03:35:31.348 --> 03:35:35.791]  These are serious people who've done this for a living for decades.
[03:35:35.791 --> 03:35:41.155]  They have in their hands the largest currently available data sets on this question.
[03:35:41.155 --> 03:35:46.879]  And the question they're asking after analyzing all of those numbers, are the lockdowns worth it?
[03:35:47.884 --> 03:35:49.826]  So what is the answer to that?
[03:35:49.826 --> 03:35:56.553]  What's so striking is that so many politicians, the ones enforcing the lockdowns, don't seem at all interested in asking it.
[03:35:56.553 --> 03:35:58.696]  Instead, they're bullying forward as if nothing has changed.
[03:35:58.696 --> 03:36:04.021]  Just today, the San Francisco Bay Area announced it'll be extending its lockdown until the end of May.
[03:36:04.021 --> 03:36:05.142]  That's five weeks from now.
[03:36:06.121 --> 03:36:09.662]  What is the scientific justification for doing that?
[03:36:09.662 --> 03:36:12.582]  They didn't tell us, because there is none.
[03:36:12.582 --> 03:36:13.683]  None.
[03:36:13.683 --> 03:36:16.243]  You may remember what they first told us back in February and March.
[03:36:16.243 --> 03:36:20.864]  They said, we have to take radical steps in order to, quote, flatten the curve.
[03:36:20.864 --> 03:36:26.786]  Well, six weeks later, we're happy to say that curve has been flattened, but it's likely not because of the lockdowns.
[03:36:26.786 --> 03:36:29.946]  The virus just isn't nearly as deadly as we thought it was.
[03:36:29.946 --> 03:36:31.347]  All of us, including on this show.
[03:36:31.347 --> 03:36:32.247]  Everybody thought it was.
[03:36:32.847 --> 03:36:34.488]  But it turned out not to be.
[03:36:34.488 --> 03:36:36.210]  Hospitals never collapsed.
[03:36:36.210 --> 03:36:43.116]  Outside of a tiny number of places, they never came close to collapsing, at least not from an influx of infected patients.
[03:36:43.116 --> 03:36:45.077]  Instead, something remarkable happened.
[03:36:45.077 --> 03:36:48.260]  Something amazing, really without parallel in American history.
[03:36:48.260 --> 03:36:50.122]  The opposite happened.
[03:36:50.122 --> 03:36:54.465]  Thanks to the lockdowns, hospitals have begun to collapse.
[03:36:54.465 --> 03:36:54.986]  Why?
[03:36:54.986 --> 03:36:55.986]  From a lack of patients.
[03:36:56.767 --> 03:37:05.669]  Politicians who couldn't pass 9th grade biology decided that practicing physicians should not be allowed to calculate the risk of transmitting the virus.
[03:37:05.669 --> 03:37:08.090]  They're just not qualified, unlike us.
[03:37:08.090 --> 03:37:14.391]  So these politicians banned so-called non-essential procedures, many of which are in fact essential.
[03:37:14.391 --> 03:37:16.111]  The results of this policy?
[03:37:16.111 --> 03:37:19.712]  In many hospitals, entire floors have been mothballed.
[03:37:19.712 --> 03:37:23.353]  Doctors and nurses are being furloughed in the middle of a pandemic.
[03:37:24.301 --> 03:37:26.502]  This is insanity.
[03:37:26.502 --> 03:37:28.883]  It weakens our healthcare system.
[03:37:28.883 --> 03:37:32.144]  Its effects will last for many years.
[03:37:32.144 --> 03:37:34.104]  That's all from the lockdown.
[03:37:34.104 --> 03:37:37.306]  So how long will we have to live with these lockdowns?
[03:37:37.306 --> 03:37:47.029]  Earlier this month, Dr. Anthony Fauci, whom we are apparently required by law to respect no matter what he says, suggested that in fact we may never be allowed to resume normal life.
[03:37:48.755 --> 03:38:00.147]  If back to normal means acting like there never was a coronavirus problem, I don't think that's going to happen until we do have a situation where you can completely protect the population.
[03:38:00.147 --> 03:38:07.294]  If you want to get to pre-coronavirus, you know, that might not ever happen in the sense of the fact that the threat is there.
[03:38:10.523 --> 03:38:36.129]  Now we should tell you that is the same Dr. Fauci, and keep this to yourself because as noted it's not allowed to show any skepticism whatsoever, but that's the same Dr. Fauci who also announced that shaking hands, the ancient custom of shaking hands, should be done away with forever, and then a week later told Snapchat that actually it's fine to have sex with strangers you meet on Tinder.
[03:38:36.129 --> 03:38:37.910]  That was his epidemiological advice.
[03:38:38.982 --> 03:38:46.048]  Other experts on television warned that full-blown lockdowns may be necessary until a vaccine or effective treatments are found.
[03:38:46.048 --> 03:38:55.777]  What they didn't mention is that scientists have never produced a single approved vaccine or antiviral drug for any coronavirus.
[03:38:55.777 --> 03:38:57.458]  So that could be a while.
[03:38:57.458 --> 03:39:01.122]  And that thought seemed to please frequent television guest Zeke Emanuel.
[03:39:02.239 --> 03:39:07.566]  Realistically, COVID-19 will be here for the next 18 months or more.
[03:39:07.566 --> 03:39:13.994]  We will not be able to return to normalcy until we find a vaccine or effective medications.
[03:39:13.994 --> 03:39:18.499]  Is all that economic pain worth trying to stop COVID-19?
[03:39:18.499 --> 03:39:20.482]  The truth is, we have no choice.
[03:39:23.788 --> 03:39:26.130]  Oh, the truth is we have no choice.
[03:39:26.130 --> 03:39:29.052]  Well, here's a handy guide for you in case you watch a lot of television.
[03:39:29.052 --> 03:39:39.460]  When a political operative like Zeke Emanuel, someone with a long history of lying, begins a sentence with the phrase, the truth is, you should probably be on guard.
[03:39:39.460 --> 03:39:43.243]  When he ends that sentence with, we have no choice, you should be terrified.
[03:39:44.079 --> 03:39:44.940]  And in fact, that's wrong.
[03:39:44.940 --> 03:39:47.021]  We have always had a choice.
[03:39:47.021 --> 03:39:49.863]  Other countries made different choices from ours, in fact.
[03:39:49.863 --> 03:39:53.406]  They're not waiting for a vaccine to open their societies.
[03:39:53.406 --> 03:39:54.707]  Why would they do that?
[03:39:54.707 --> 03:39:57.869]  There's no precedent for doing that as a scientific matter.
[03:39:57.869 --> 03:40:04.274]  For example, we spent millions of dollars and more than a decade trying to find a vaccine for the SARS virus.
[03:40:04.274 --> 03:40:06.355]  Scientists never developed one.
[03:40:06.355 --> 03:40:07.516]  That's a shame.
[03:40:07.516 --> 03:40:10.178]  But did we halt life in the United States in response?
[03:40:11.360 --> 03:40:12.041]  We didn't.
[03:40:12.041 --> 03:40:15.368]  In fact, you may not even remember that any of that happened.
[03:40:15.368 --> 03:40:19.736]  The striking thing is, the science has not changed that much since then.
[03:40:19.736 --> 03:40:23.162]  Unfortunately, American politics have changed a lot.
[03:40:23.162 --> 03:40:23.924]  And that's the difference.
[03:40:26.249 --> 03:40:34.015]  Let's take a course and of course the video he played at the beginning of that monologue was the two doctors questioning the logic of continuing lockdown measures.
[03:40:34.015 --> 03:40:41.962]  The video that was summarily deleted by YouTube after garnering 5 million plus views because we're not allowed to question health authorities.
[03:40:41.962 --> 03:40:51.509]  Health authorities like the WHO whose leader Mr Ted Ross said yesterday the world should have listened to the WHO.
[03:40:52.762 --> 03:41:02.986]  Despite its complicity in helping China cover up the severity of the coronavirus pandemic, the head of the World Health Organization claimed the world should have listened to the WHO.
[03:41:02.986 --> 03:41:09.748]  The sheer inaccuracy of these statements would be funny if not for the fact that lives were lost due to the WHO's mishandling of the outbreak.
[03:41:09.748 --> 03:41:17.911]  At every step of the way, the WHO praised China's actions on coronavirus despite widespread evidence that the virus was leaked from a lab
[03:41:18.965 --> 03:41:29.447]  And in fact, the sources who told Fox News confirmed that it was leaked from that lab said that the WHO was complicit in helping China cover it up.
[03:41:29.447 --> 03:41:43.190]  Of course, on January 14th, as I've mentioned many times, the WHO amplified Chinese government propaganda that there had been, quote, no human-to-human transmission of COVID-19, despite this having actually occurred back in November.
[03:41:44.286 --> 03:41:54.630]  The WHO blocked doctors from urging countries to impose border controls to stop the spread of coronavirus and repeatedly told countries not to close borders.
[03:41:54.630 --> 03:41:57.711]  I report on their statements every single few days.
[03:41:57.711 --> 03:41:59.692]  They repeated the same mantra.
[03:41:59.692 --> 03:42:01.172]  Don't close your borders.
[03:42:01.172 --> 03:42:03.173]  Don't impose any kind of screening.
[03:42:03.533 --> 03:42:06.495]  Which targets Chinese people because that might be racist.
[03:42:06.495 --> 03:42:09.457]  These are the people now saying you should have listened to us.
[03:42:09.457 --> 03:42:11.098]  No, we shouldn't have listened to you.
[03:42:11.098 --> 03:42:20.884]  We should have done the exact opposite because you were complicit in covering up the spread of this virus with the communist Chinese government right up until the end of February.
[03:42:21.815 --> 03:42:26.918]  The WHO continue to advise against the ap- This is their quote from their statement.
[03:42:26.918 --> 03:42:33.141]  To advise against the application of travel or trade restrictions to countries experiencing Covid-19 outbreaks.
[03:42:33.141 --> 03:42:42.227]  Even as all those thousands, tens of thousands of Chinese migrants were flying from Wuhan to Northern Italy, the epicentre of the outbreak in Europe.
[03:42:42.227 --> 03:42:43.087]  No, you got it wrong.
[03:42:43.087 --> 03:42:44.488]  You covered it all with China.
[03:42:44.488 --> 03:42:46.389]  We should not have listened to you.
[03:42:46.389 --> 03:42:47.910]  Gonna wrap it up this segment.
[03:42:47.910 --> 03:42:48.630]  We'll be back.
[03:42:48.630 --> 03:42:49.371]  Summit.News.
[03:42:49.371 --> 03:42:49.811]  Don't go away.
[03:42:51.693 --> 03:42:54.055]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[03:42:54.055 --> 03:42:54.635]  They're amazing.
[03:42:54.635 --> 03:42:55.295]  They're cutting edge.
[03:42:55.295 --> 03:42:55.736]  You love them.
[03:42:55.736 --> 03:42:56.376]  I love them.
[03:42:56.376 --> 03:43:00.018]  And they fund the InfoWars in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[03:43:00.018 --> 03:43:03.961]  But we have come up with a new product over a year in development.
[03:43:05.120 --> 03:43:06.781]  That is amazing.
[03:43:06.781 --> 03:43:14.444]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[03:43:14.444 --> 03:43:16.765]  And there's another innovation.
[03:43:16.765 --> 03:43:18.845]  It's the spray cap.
[03:43:18.845 --> 03:43:24.268]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality.
[03:43:24.268 --> 03:43:26.428]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[03:43:26.428 --> 03:43:27.349]  I like to put it on my hands.
[03:43:28.089 --> 03:43:29.610]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[03:43:29.610 --> 03:43:32.411]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so don't spray it right in your eyes.
[03:43:32.411 --> 03:43:36.814]  But I just love it, personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[03:43:36.814 --> 03:43:38.594]  So, this is a real innovation.
[03:43:38.594 --> 03:43:44.938]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out.
[03:43:44.938 --> 03:43:46.478]  It smells great.
[03:43:46.478 --> 03:43:48.319]  It's so refreshing.
[03:43:48.319 --> 03:43:49.180]  This is a big winner.
[03:43:52.157 --> 03:43:57.059]  Cobra is now in command of you and your family.
[03:43:57.059 --> 03:44:13.304]  Google and Facebook, as well as Apple, work closely with our organization, the ESCOR, to surveil your every movement with robot drones and other systems to ensure the safety of the public.
[03:44:13.304 --> 03:44:16.065]  Of course, it was I 12 years ago with Obama
[03:44:16.945 --> 03:44:18.846]  We're good to go.
[03:44:44.632 --> 03:44:51.094]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[03:45:03.157 --> 03:45:07.881]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[03:45:07.881 --> 03:45:10.243]  Super Male Vitality!
[03:45:10.243 --> 03:45:19.091]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[03:45:19.091 --> 03:45:29.960]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[03:45:30.240 --> 03:45:30.921]  Yes.
[03:45:30.921 --> 03:45:35.824]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[03:45:35.824 --> 03:45:42.728]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[03:45:42.728 --> 03:45:43.789]  So what are you waiting for?
[03:45:43.789 --> 03:45:45.670]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[03:45:45.670 --> 03:45:48.471]  Never been a better time than right now.
[03:45:48.471 --> 03:45:51.974]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com
[03:45:54.059 --> 03:46:00.221]  Well, Communist China wouldn't sign on to the carbon taxes that would cut their energy use by half.
[03:46:00.221 --> 03:46:02.462]  And the United States wouldn't sign on to it.
[03:46:02.462 --> 03:46:03.622]  So guess what happened?
[03:46:03.622 --> 03:46:10.705]  Along came COVID-19, and Bill Gates is celebrating, saying it's already cut your carbon footprint by half.
[03:46:10.705 --> 03:46:14.086]  And that means you're going to be poor now, and under his control.
[03:46:14.086 --> 03:46:21.569]  And of course, with the medical tyranny comes the forced inoculations, a eek microchip that comes with the vaccine, and so much more.
[03:46:22.049 --> 03:46:27.032]  And Bill Gates admits that 700,000 people will get sick and die from it.
[03:46:27.032 --> 03:46:31.955]  So remember, folks, they're coming to hurt you and your family and destroy your basic rights.
[03:46:31.955 --> 03:46:39.859]  The same left that says to kill babies all day long, women own their bodies, now say you don't own your body, and they're coming to forcibly inoculate you.
[03:46:39.859 --> 03:46:43.682]  And if you don't submit, you can't buy or sell or leave your home, mark the beast.
[03:46:43.682 --> 03:46:45.042]  Oh, and guess what?
[03:46:45.042 --> 03:46:50.846]  Jeffrey Epstein and all these people hang out together with Bill Gates and are a bunch of dirty devil worshippers in your face.
[03:46:51.306 --> 03:46:55.647]  They hate you and your family.
[03:46:55.647 --> 03:47:08.410]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:08.410 --> 03:47:17.172]  Broadcasting internationally from the Summit.News headquarters in the United Kingdom, it's Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:47:19.637 --> 03:47:24.039]  ABC News just tweeted a video on their official Twitter account about an hour ago.
[03:47:24.039 --> 03:47:32.722]  It says, a nurse receives a rousing applause from her neighbours as they gather to cheer for her on her way to work in Maryland.
[03:47:32.722 --> 03:47:38.224]  Now this entire idol worship of nurses and health workers has obviously gone too far.
[03:47:38.224 --> 03:47:45.887]  That's not to blame the nurses, the doctors or the health workers whose job is obviously incredibly important and incredibly stressful.
[03:47:45.887 --> 03:47:47.107]  This entire narrative
[03:47:48.174 --> 03:47:55.157]  about idol worship of nurses has been predicated on not being allowed to question health authorities.
[03:47:55.157 --> 03:48:02.200]  We've seen that with social media, with YouTube deleting videos from actual doctors questioning other health authorities.
[03:48:02.200 --> 03:48:15.346]  But that's why they launched this cultural narrative of the nurse worship, the idol worship, to the point where they now have scarecrows in British villages and towns dressed up as NHS workers
[03:48:15.902 --> 03:48:27.456]  With the full masks, the gloves, the PPE that's supposedly in a severe shortage but they're using it to put on scarecrows which are then positioned at people's front gates.
[03:48:28.621 --> 03:48:32.522]  So again, idol worship, literally idol worship the NHS.
[03:48:32.522 --> 03:48:41.265]  Because as you know, we have every week in the United Kingdom at 8pm on Thursday, the entire country gets out on their balconies and applauds the NHS.
[03:48:41.265 --> 03:48:50.788]  And now it's got to the point where people who not refuse to do that, but just forget to do that, are being publicly shamed on social media.
[03:48:50.788 --> 03:48:57.951]  In fact, we had the article last week, UK mother named and shamed on Facebook for not clapping the NHS.
[03:48:58.755 --> 03:49:02.417]  This was somebody who was having problems with her child trying to get him to bed.
[03:49:02.417 --> 03:49:03.938]  He was acting out.
[03:49:03.938 --> 03:49:06.039]  So she finally got her child to bed.
[03:49:06.039 --> 03:49:11.301]  She fell asleep before 8pm when this big clap-a-thon happens every week.
[03:49:11.301 --> 03:49:17.625]  And because she failed to take part, again, not because she didn't want to, she simply fell asleep and forgot about it.
[03:49:17.625 --> 03:49:24.428]  The next day she was publicly shamed on Facebook with her entire community finding out about it.
[03:49:24.428 --> 03:49:25.929]  Very, very strange.
[03:49:27.020 --> 03:49:28.181]  Idle worship of nurses.
[03:49:28.181 --> 03:49:49.357]  But again, it's a narrative that's been pushed by health authorities and by the media to make it verboten to criticise health authorities, to the point where we had this article last week on Friday, headlined, Nurses at Hospital in Paris Recreate Last Supper with Themselves as Jesus and His Apostles.
[03:49:49.357 --> 03:49:50.918]  So they literally re-enacted
[03:49:51.556 --> 03:49:57.241]  Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper painting, with themselves playing the part of Jesus and his apostles.
[03:49:57.241 --> 03:50:01.824]  This was the Hospital de la Sapitriere in Paris.
[03:50:01.824 --> 03:50:17.957]  And they captioned it, huge thanks to our daily heroes, a big up to the care team of the cardiac surgery unit of CHU in this Paris hospital, literally depicting themselves as Jesus and his apostles, as if the idol worship was not bad enough.
[03:50:19.477 --> 03:50:38.247]  Now, if you don't like me criticising that, well, why not listen to the families of cancer victims who are not getting treatment, as I explained earlier in the show, because they're either fearful of catching coronavirus when they visit hospital, or they're being told their screenings, their treatments have been suspended.
[03:50:38.247 --> 03:50:40.248]  So they're not going to hospital.
[03:50:40.248 --> 03:50:48.313]  Of course, Professor Sullivan warned that this would cause more excess cancer deaths than total coronavirus deaths in the UK over the next five years.
[03:50:48.996 --> 03:51:15.309]  The families of these cancer patients have spoke out against this bizarre idol worship of health workers also, and in particular with these TikTok dancers, which thankfully, since people started to question this, that it was not great optics to tell the population that we needed to lock down, to social distance, to upheave our lives for the best part of the next year, we're now being told, and we may never get back to normal.
[03:51:16.167 --> 03:51:20.489]  Because of the overwhelmed hospitals, because we need to support the doctors and nurses.
[03:51:20.489 --> 03:51:26.692]  Meanwhile, they're dancing around with giant smiles on their face and uploading these videos to TikTok.
[03:51:26.692 --> 03:51:28.473]  Not great optics.
[03:51:28.473 --> 03:51:32.635]  Nobody's saying that you can't, you know, relieve some stress.
[03:51:32.635 --> 03:51:34.036]  That's not the point.
[03:51:34.036 --> 03:51:37.257]  The point is this does not send the right message.
[03:51:37.257 --> 03:51:39.619]  I wrote about this in the article.
[03:51:39.619 --> 03:51:41.239]  Disrespectful.
[03:51:41.239 --> 03:51:44.501]  Families of cancer patients slam nurse dancing videos.
[03:51:45.191 --> 03:51:54.997]  There's families of cancer patients whose loved ones are not able to receive treatment in hospitals because of the coronavirus pandemic, of slam videos which show nurses dancing as disrespectful.
[03:51:54.997 --> 03:52:02.703]  And in fact, if I can find the quote, this was from a nurse, I believe, or the family member of a nurse.
[03:52:02.703 --> 03:52:08.066]  She said, I'm seriously peed off seeing NHS staff dancing and fooling around.
[03:52:08.066 --> 03:52:12.609]  My brother is working 14-hour days in an ICU in London, treating COVID-19 patients.
[03:52:14.429 --> 03:52:18.611]  My sister is still performing surgery, is separated from her son.
[03:52:18.611 --> 03:52:22.833]  Cancer patients are having treatment and scans cancelled.
[03:52:22.833 --> 03:52:25.234]  She says, I've seen it from several different hospitals.
[03:52:25.234 --> 03:52:28.696]  And again, this is not just the UK, obviously, this is in America too.
[03:52:28.696 --> 03:52:30.657]  And Spain and Italy and France.
[03:52:30.657 --> 03:52:34.298]  It's so disrespectful when there are so many ill and dying.
[03:52:34.298 --> 03:52:40.041]  Imagine someone who has just lost a loved one seeing these dumb videos.
[03:52:40.041 --> 03:52:41.902]  In fact, I received numerous messages
[03:52:43.090 --> 03:52:51.272]  On Twitter, on comments from nurses who agree with me and who agree with these families of cancer patients.
[03:52:51.272 --> 03:52:54.993]  So again, it's not an offence against NHS staff.
[03:52:54.993 --> 03:53:02.716]  It's not an insult towards them to question the tastefulness of these TikTok dancing videos.
[03:53:02.716 --> 03:53:11.378]  In fact, there is another doctor who said, quote, I'm a doctor and I'm really sick of this constant praise and virtue signalling for healthcare workers.
[03:53:12.307 --> 03:53:18.452]  He said hospitals are empty due to lack of elective cases and severe drop in trauma and emergency cases.
[03:53:18.452 --> 03:53:21.895]  Yet we keep hearing about this hospitals being overwhelmed nonsense.
[03:53:21.895 --> 03:53:28.180]  Yet healthcare workers somehow find time, despite being so overwhelmed, to do their cringy TikTok videos.
[03:53:28.180 --> 03:53:34.545]  A lot of hospitals are actually struggling to stay open because their main sources of income are from elective cases and admissions.
[03:53:34.545 --> 03:53:38.969]  So it's actually costing them economically in the long term.
[03:53:38.969 --> 03:53:39.930]  So we have that going on.
[03:53:39.930 --> 03:53:41.151]  We have people being shamed
[03:53:42.358 --> 03:53:47.142]  For forgetting to clap in the UK for the NHS every Thursday night.
[03:53:47.142 --> 03:53:53.067]  And of course we have YouTube censoring the viral video of the doctors criticising the stay-at-home order.
[03:53:53.067 --> 03:53:56.711]  We also have this article out of Reclaim the Net.
[03:53:56.711 --> 03:54:02.315]  YouTube introduces fact-checker info panels to editorialise user search results.
[03:54:02.315 --> 03:54:07.420]  Of course you know already on YouTube they've completely gamed their search engine and the entire algorithm.
[03:54:07.861 --> 03:54:19.090]  To the point where you type in any search term, basically, that's vaguely news-related, and you get a wall of 50, 60 CNN, ABC, CBS articles before you get to anything else.
[03:54:19.090 --> 03:54:32.261]  Well, now YouTube is continuing its war on misinformation by rolling out panels containing messages from fact-checkers, who of course have been proven partisan and biased on numerous occasions, to search results on the platform.
[03:54:32.955 --> 03:54:40.441]  Panels have been tested in Brazil and India throughout 2019 and show when a user searches for a topic that YouTube deems to be problematic.
[03:54:40.441 --> 03:54:43.123]  And at this point, that's basically everything.
[03:54:43.123 --> 03:54:53.751]  So now, not even when you get to the video, of course, many of which have warnings on, you go on a video about global warming, it indoctrinates you about how man-made global warming is beyond question, of course.
[03:54:54.378 --> 03:55:04.282]  Now they're so nervous about people hearing any other opinion, they're putting it in the search box before you even get to any of the results.
[03:55:04.282 --> 03:55:09.684]  Meanwhile, Facebook admits banning users for saying they're proud to be English.
[03:55:09.684 --> 03:55:13.945]  Because we had St George's Day a couple of days ago here in the United Kingdom.
[03:55:13.945 --> 03:55:18.347]  We've had stories in the past of councils in the UK banning the display of
[03:55:19.045 --> 03:55:19.466]  The St.
[03:55:19.466 --> 03:55:21.669]  George's Cross, which is the English flag.
[03:55:21.669 --> 03:55:25.215]  God forbid we could fly the English flag in England!
[03:55:25.215 --> 03:55:30.985]  Now Facebook has admitted to banning swaths of users for posting messages saying they were proud to be English on St.
[03:55:30.985 --> 03:55:31.706]  George's Day.
[03:55:33.815 --> 03:55:48.522]  An image bearing the legend proud to be English and two crossed flagpoles carrying the English Saint George's Cross and the White Lion on a red field, a banner associated with Anglo-Saxons, appears to have proved particularly offensive to the so-called Masters of the Universe.
[03:55:48.522 --> 03:55:59.428]  And a bunch of those posts, God forbid, showing the English flag on England's National Day, was violation of community standards on Facebook.
[03:55:59.428 --> 03:56:02.269]  I think Babylon Bee came out with an article earlier where they said,
[03:56:03.413 --> 03:56:11.096]  The First Amendment is now a violation of community standards because it encourages people to break the law.
[03:56:11.096 --> 03:56:16.918]  Meanwhile, Breitbart reports Paris no-go suburbs breaking lockdown measures three times more than average.
[03:56:16.918 --> 03:56:31.643]  Of course, we had the article a couple of weeks ago now from one of the French Interior Ministers who suggested that these lockdown measures should not be imposed in migrant-heavy suburbs of Paris and other areas of France.
[03:56:32.904 --> 03:56:35.725]  Because one, they're not being adhered to anyway.
[03:56:35.725 --> 03:56:38.426]  And two, because they might start riots.
[03:56:38.426 --> 03:56:45.208]  Well, of course, we did have riots in Paris and in 25 other municipalities across France last week.
[03:56:45.208 --> 03:56:53.911]  The previous weekend, because of an incident with a motorcyclist crashing into a police car, they were out on the street rioting for days and days on end.
[03:56:53.911 --> 03:56:55.692]  Not social distancing.
[03:56:55.692 --> 03:56:58.893]  Now residents in the no-go Paris suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis
[03:56:59.813 --> 03:57:07.137]  ...have received three times the number of fines for breaking Wuhan coronavirus lockdown measures than the French national average.
[03:57:07.137 --> 03:57:23.067]  The heavily migrant populated department, which of course the mainstream media says doesn't exist, they actually said that back in 2015, 400,000 illegal immigrants lived there, has seen a total of 41,000 tickets handed out for lockdown violations out of 242,000 checks by police.
[03:57:23.067 --> 03:57:26.489]  Again, that is four times the national average.
[03:57:27.150 --> 03:57:31.212]  The rules apply to some people and apparently not to others.
[03:57:31.212 --> 03:57:32.433]  That's going to wrap it up for the show.
[03:57:32.433 --> 03:57:33.794]  Breaking news at Summit.News.
[03:57:33.794 --> 03:57:35.515]  Coming up next, Warren with Owen Troyer.
[03:57:35.515 --> 03:57:36.936]  Don't go away, he's good right here.
