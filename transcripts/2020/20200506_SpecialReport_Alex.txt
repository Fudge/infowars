[00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:02.712]  The economy is not going to be anything like it was.
[00:00:02.732 --> 00:00:04.775]  It's going to take a long time to recover.
[00:00:04.855 --> 00:00:09.400]  It's going to be, you know, people are going to be surprised at how slow and how fitful this is.
[00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.747]  Let's watch that video one more time where Bill Gates becomes visibly
[00:00:16.778 --> 00:00:22.843]  In the video, Gates gets more excited than Beto O'Rourke did when he learned about the mass shooting at the El Paso Walmart.
[00:00:46.738 --> 00:00:48.059]  Why are these guys so happy?
[00:00:48.419 --> 00:00:51.380]  Because they know it's moving their agenda forward.
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.101]  With Beto O'Rourke, it's disarming the population.
[00:00:54.341 --> 00:01:02.264]  With Bill Gates, he's on record wanting to starve the third world, wanting to depopulate Africa, Latin America, and Asia.
[00:01:02.745 --> 00:01:13.669]  But now we're supposed to forget all that and say, oh, he's the new dictator of the world, the unelected leader that controls all the major health institutes of the planet,
[00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:16.679]  And the UN's World Health Organization.
[00:01:17.281 --> 00:01:18.582]  But it's not just that clip.
[00:01:19.202 --> 00:01:33.811]  In every interview he does, we have hundreds of these from the last few months, when he talks about forced inoculation, when he talks about we're never going to unlock the planet again, when he talks about depression, he gets very, very excited and very, very happy.
[00:01:34.171 --> 00:01:41.375]  But when he's talking about President Trump or America or the free market or success, he looks very, very upset.
[00:01:41.976 --> 00:01:45.918]  It's only when he talks about planetary collapse that he gets excited.
[00:01:46.328 --> 00:01:52.976]  Because he believes he's saving the Earth by artificially using this panic to shut down the world economy.
[00:01:53.737 --> 00:02:00.846]  Here are a few more clips of Bill Gates in the last few days with Trevor Noah, the supposed entertainment show, and the Financial Times of London.
[00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:17.818]  Also getting visually excited when he talks about financial collapse, when he talks about world government, when he talks about forced inoculation, and all 7 billion people having to be forcibly injected before the world could ever, quote, go back to normal.
[00:02:18.238 --> 00:02:19.939]  It's called holding us hostage.
[00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:47.926]  The ultimate solution, the only thing that really lets us go back completely to normal and feel good about sitting in a stadium with lots of other people is to create a vaccine and not just take care of our country but take that vaccine out to the global population and so that we have vast immunity and this thing, no matter what, isn't going to spread in large numbers.
[00:02:48.795 --> 00:02:54.977]  What do you think the right balance is between the trade-off of protecting people's lives and the economic hit?
[00:02:55.097 --> 00:03:02.039]  I mean, do you see a situation where the global economy could be virtually at a standstill for a year or even more?
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.621]  Well, it won't go to zero, but it will shrink.
[00:03:05.821 --> 00:03:11.643]  Global GDP is going to take probably the biggest hit ever.
[00:03:12.483 --> 00:03:14.724]  Maybe the Depression was worse or 1873, I don't know.
[00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.381]  In my lifetime, this will be the greatest economic hit.
[00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.982]  But you don't have a choice.
[00:03:23.042 --> 00:03:24.362]  People act like you have a choice.
[00:03:24.882 --> 00:03:30.484]  People don't feel like going to the stadium when they might get infected.
[00:03:31.304 --> 00:03:36.245]  It's not the government who's saying, okay, just ignore this disease.
[00:03:37.145 --> 00:03:38.986]  People are deeply affected.
[00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:49.351]  By seeing these deaths, by knowing they could be part of the transmission chain and old people, their parents, their grandparents could be affected by this.
[00:03:49.431 --> 00:03:51.734]  And so you don't get to say, ignore
[00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.811]  I think?
[00:04:16.869 --> 00:04:30.656]  You know, although there's a lot of work on testing, a lot of work on drugs that we're involved with, you know, trying to achieve that ambitious goal, which has never been done for the vaccine, that rises to the top of the list.
[00:04:31.216 --> 00:04:38.419]  It takes a world government run by the UN to forcibly inject 7 billion people, every person on earth.
[00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.181]  And that's where the contact tracers come in.
[00:04:41.815 --> 00:04:50.180]  And Bill Clinton and others have been preparing these groups with Democrat governors who are going to come knock on your door and try to basically force you to take inoculations.
[00:04:50.821 --> 00:04:52.382]  This is the new tyranny.
[00:04:52.722 --> 00:05:00.027]  And if Hitler would have thought something up like this, he probably would have won because people tend to submit to quote medical workers.
[00:05:00.728 --> 00:05:01.589]  And that's what's scary.
[00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:16.865]  Gates goes on to say that China has done a perfect job welding people in their homes, shooting women at checkpoints, drones controlling populations, and that America hasn't gone far enough in this clip.
[00:05:17.671 --> 00:05:21.413]  Which countries do you think we should be looking to for models that work?
[00:05:21.533 --> 00:05:25.036]  And can we apply those models to a larger country like the United States?
[00:05:25.096 --> 00:05:31.320]  So, you know, many people say Italy and Korea, yes, have their numbers, but they can't necessarily be applied to America.
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:32.400]  Is that true or not?
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.543]  Or is there a model that does seem to work and should be followed for everybody?
[00:05:37.003 --> 00:05:38.664]  Well, countries have differences.
[00:05:39.844 --> 00:05:53.028]  South Korea did get a medium-sized infection, but then they used testing and forced quarantine, contact tracing, and really bent the curve, even though it looked pretty scary there for a while.
[00:05:53.708 --> 00:05:56.709]  The epidemic in the United States is more widespread.
[00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:57.849]  All right.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.081]  Invasive and so won't be quite as perfect.
[00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:31.965]  But it is very good news that China, although they're maintaining a lot of measures, they are not seeing a rebound.
[00:06:31.985 --> 00:06:39.548]  They're not seeing cases coming back, even though they are sending people back to the factories and sending people back to schools.
[00:06:40.428 --> 00:06:51.256]  And, you know, so thank goodness, if we're seeing a big rebound there, the idea you could keep it under control would, once you have a large number of cases, like the U.S.
[00:06:51.296 --> 00:06:57.721]  does in many countries in Europe, then it, you know, would seem almost impossible.
[00:06:57.821 --> 00:06:59.222]  So it can be done.
[00:06:59.242 --> 00:07:03.866]  You know, China ended up with 0.01% of their population infected.
[00:07:03.886 --> 00:07:09.550]  You know, our goal is to stay so it's only a few percent, so at least the medical penalty
[00:07:12.551 --> 00:07:17.152]  Here's the bottom line.
[00:07:18.012 --> 00:07:25.233]  Bill Gates represents a global government consortium that is on record taking over the planet through financial fraud.
[00:07:25.633 --> 00:07:29.274]  And now they see all the people of the planet as trash to be taken out.
[00:07:29.734 --> 00:07:36.276]  They want a post-human era where humans are replaced with robots and the population is cut down to at least 500 million.
[00:07:37.296 --> 00:07:40.077]  That's what the Georgia Guidestones promote, put up by Ted Turner.
[00:07:40.437 --> 00:07:52.520]  And that's what Bill Gates and Ted Turner and Warren Buffett and Jeffrey Epstein and others who are on record meeting secretly for decades to develop a world government to carry out depopulation.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:08:01.842]  And now they, through Hollywood and the media, have pre-programmed people that when there's a deadly virus, civilization shuts down and that everyone is forcibly inoculated.
[00:08:02.302 --> 00:08:05.543]  And so now they're actually going operational with that plan.
[00:08:06.283 --> 00:08:08.045]  But the most important thing to know is this.
[00:08:08.946 --> 00:08:15.734]  Even the head of the World Food Program has come out and said 135 million people are going to starve to death the next year because of this.
[00:08:16.795 --> 00:08:18.878]  100 plus times what COVID-19 will kill.
[00:08:19.773 --> 00:08:27.435]  But you need to give the UN a bunch of money and power to now save the people that they've made dependent by cutting off their economies.
[00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:30.775]  This is a giant power grab.
[00:08:31.136 --> 00:08:32.416]  This is a criminal takeover.
[00:08:32.536 --> 00:08:44.098]  And major insurance companies in South Africa have done actuary studies and admit that the death toll by the COVID-19 shutdown is 29 times what COVID-19 actually has killed.
[00:08:44.599 --> 00:08:46.039]  So the virus doesn't kill you.
[00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:50.904]  There are a further 135 million people facing crisis levels of hunger or worse.
[00:08:50.924 --> 00:08:55.068]  That means 135 million people on earth are marching toward the brink of starvation.
[00:08:55.148 --> 00:08:56.709]  An additional 130 million people
[00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:12.101]  That's a total of 265 million people.
[00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:15.866]  Our analysis shows that 300,000 people could starve to death every single day over a three-month period.
[00:09:26.442 --> 00:09:30.505]  And you and I and everyone watching don't have to take it lying down.
[00:09:31.065 --> 00:09:39.210]  Even Project Veritas has now gotten the undercover video that indeed CBS News and others are staging long lines going into hospitals.
[00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:43.152]  We first broke this two months ago and people couldn't believe it.
[00:09:43.613 --> 00:09:46.975]  Now we've had medical doctors and nurses on admitting they're empty.
[00:09:47.455 --> 00:09:53.399]  And the few patients that come in, they're ordered to lie on the forms and say they had COVID to get the money.
[00:09:53.979 --> 00:09:59.123]  The government orders the hospitals closed all over the planet because the UN is running this world government.
[00:09:59.723 --> 00:10:04.246]  Then there's no money and they say you can only code for COVID-19.
[00:10:04.266 --> 00:10:06.428]  $13,000 for a patient.
[00:10:06.448 --> 00:10:08.149]  $39,000 if you put a tube down their throat.
[00:10:08.509 --> 00:10:09.790]  And the list goes on and on.
[00:10:10.350 --> 00:10:12.031]  This is how the technocracy works.
[00:10:12.412 --> 00:10:18.316]  Programming the economy to carry out depopulation here in the first world and in the third world.
[00:10:19.116 --> 00:10:20.057]  We must spread the word.
[00:10:20.497 --> 00:10:21.697]  We must expose the hoax.
[00:10:22.018 --> 00:10:41.548]  We have to politely get in the face of the social distancers and the mass cult who wear it as their sign of slavery, their mark of being idiots, and explain to them that they've been told they're heroes for doing this, but really they're enabling the breakdown of civilization and a global depression that will kill hundreds of millions of people if it isn't stopped now.
[00:10:42.188 --> 00:10:43.329]  That is the reality.
[00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.871]  Exercise your free speech while it's still left.
[00:10:46.192 --> 00:10:48.514]  There's massive tech censorship everywhere as you know.
[00:10:48.934 --> 00:10:52.077]  Even medical doctors questioning the official story are being shut down.
[00:10:52.537 --> 00:10:54.138]  But that's why we have Band.Video.
[00:10:54.499 --> 00:10:56.020]  That's why we have NewsWars.com.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:04.768]  That's why we have InfoWars.com with our own embattled platforms so you can still get this information and share it even by word of mouth.
[00:11:05.308 --> 00:11:07.250]  Please take action now before it's too late.
[00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:08.491]  There isn't much time.
[00:11:08.939 --> 00:11:11.501]  Boys, this is gonna take a long time to recover.
[00:11:11.561 --> 00:11:24.652]  It's gonna be... You know, people are gonna be surprised at how... Make a friend with death.
[00:11:24.873 --> 00:11:28.175]  It's a saying so old that no one knows who first said it.
[00:11:28.896 --> 00:11:30.538]  Every culture has their own way of...
[00:11:31.789 --> 00:11:39.797]  Memorializing that simple statement, but you don't want to make a friend of the death of civilization and the death of the human species.
[00:11:40.618 --> 00:11:42.480]  The moment of truth is now here.
[00:11:43.081 --> 00:11:54.072]  We are facing the post-human era, and I've been warning you for many years they would use a global viral crisis to click, put us in the cage, and then roll out the robot takeover.
[00:11:54.913 --> 00:11:56.974]  This is just the beta test.
[00:11:57.534 --> 00:12:01.415]  China's moving out of beta and into operational control.
[00:12:01.975 --> 00:12:05.737]  In just a few years, we will be under full globalist control.
[00:12:06.357 --> 00:12:08.337]  Forced inoculations, total surveillance.
[00:12:08.758 --> 00:12:10.978]  We're all being taught that we are obsolete.
[00:12:11.539 --> 00:12:14.139]  The term they use is non-essential.
[00:12:14.499 --> 00:12:16.380]  This is not some dystopian novel.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.881]  This is reality.
[00:12:18.361 --> 00:12:20.021]  This is the New World Order.
[00:12:20.401 --> 00:12:21.782]  This is Satanism.
