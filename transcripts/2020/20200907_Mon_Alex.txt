[00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.861]  It's Monday, September 7th.
[00:00:19.522 --> 00:00:19.982]  The year is 2020.
[00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:22.624]  It is Labor Day.
[00:00:22.644 --> 00:00:27.368]  And I want to thank you all, the most steadfast supporters of InfoWars for joining us today.
[00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.971]  Now we have a very special transmission we're going to have.
[00:00:31.691 --> 00:00:35.214]  Last Thursday's first hour I did where I issued the emergency bat signal.
[00:00:35.234 --> 00:00:38.677]  And if you haven't seen it, please watch and please share the video.
[00:00:38.717 --> 00:00:40.519]  Then the second hour, Carlos Zapata
[00:00:41.772 --> 00:00:50.020]  Who's a real leader and a veteran and a patriot and who's a very well-spoken, truthful man, very powerful man in his gravitas and will.
[00:00:51.021 --> 00:00:57.188]  Joining us, I'm really impressed with the work he's involved in because we need more leaders like him to step up in this critical time.
[00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:05.590]  And then, Dr. Mercola, a piece of that interview with some real solutions to this whole COVID hoax, and then of course, David Icke.
[00:01:06.311 --> 00:01:07.692]  That's what's coming up today.
[00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:20.342]  There is a video that we have posted, just as the show rebroadcast today, by Greg Reese, dealing with the dam breaking on the COVID crimes.
[00:01:21.302 --> 00:01:25.626]  You know, when I call it a hoax, the response to it, the overblown numbers have been a hoax.
[00:01:27.122 --> 00:01:35.291]  But what's behind the rollout of COVID-19 is a premeditated power grab, a medical tyranny, and a eugenics operation.
[00:01:35.331 --> 00:01:46.284]  So the real death is the starvation caused by the lockdown, and then of course the centralization of power, and then the forced inoculation, the contact tracing, and the Big Brother Internet of Things.
[00:01:47.498 --> 00:01:51.806]  Social credit score that is being incrementally rolled out around the world.
[00:01:52.588 --> 00:01:55.152]  Different sectors are at different points in the rollout.
[00:01:55.754 --> 00:01:58.819]  China is, of course, the tip of the spear of this technocracy.
[00:01:59.561 --> 00:01:59.921]  The model
[00:02:01.269 --> 00:02:03.550]  Australia and parts of the EU are behind him.
[00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.411]  And then, of course, liberal cities and liberal leftist states are very authoritarian.
[00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:10.772]  They are also implementing steps of this.
[00:02:10.932 --> 00:02:15.214]  And so we have to get the word out to the public that the masks are never coming off.
[00:02:15.774 --> 00:02:17.655]  The forced inoculations are never stopping.
[00:02:18.035 --> 00:02:19.655]  The contact tracing is never ending.
[00:02:20.056 --> 00:02:20.516]  This is a
[00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:23.338]  Giant leap forward of oppression.
[00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:25.240]  This is the post-industrial world.
[00:02:25.601 --> 00:02:32.969]  This is sabotaging human civilization and economies, teaching us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential.
[00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.792]  So, this is planetary genocide.
[00:02:36.553 --> 00:02:41.356]  And the heads of Google, Facebook, Twitter, all of them, Apple, are in on it.
[00:02:42.076 --> 00:02:46.319]  And they believe they're the ruling class that will carry out this culling of the planet to save us.
[00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:51.882]  That goes back to the first computers and IBM and Thomas Watson being set up for race-mixing studies.
[00:02:51.902 --> 00:02:57.526]  Then, of course, the Hollerith machines he ran inside Nazi Germany at the slave camps and forced labor camps.
[00:02:57.926 --> 00:03:00.728]  So, we've reverse-engineered this whole thing.
[00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:05.231]  On last night's Sunday show, we laid out that the
[00:03:06.508 --> 00:03:19.424]  Earth-shaking COVID developments that we already knew about a lot of it, but to have it out in the open was staggering and actually quite horrifying for a reason that I'm going to explain right now before we go to the retransmission.
[00:03:21.526 --> 00:03:23.429]  I'm holding the Associated Press in my hand right here.
[00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:31.466]  And it says, UN says, new polio outbreak in Sudan caused by oral vaccine.
[00:03:32.167 --> 00:03:35.691]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, they've been doing that since polio vaccines came out.
[00:03:35.711 --> 00:03:41.779]  They soft killed my grandmother in the 1950s and they told her that she got polio for the vaccine.
[00:03:43.775 --> 00:03:56.482]  I've talked to top medical doctors that have been involved in Africa and in the United States giving black children, which was done in black neighborhoods in Austin, live polio vaccine that actually gives them cancer, has SV40 live cancer in it.
[00:03:56.502 --> 00:03:58.843]  It would take about five hours just to cover those areas.
[00:03:58.863 --> 00:04:02.445]  Let's just say this, crime's about a thousand times bigger than Tuskegee.
[00:04:03.445 --> 00:04:08.410]  Are going on all the time, and I'm getting to the point where I just can't stand by and just talk about this anymore.
[00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.911]  We're going to have to start taking some action.
[00:04:10.231 --> 00:04:11.152]  I'm not sure what that's going to be.
[00:04:11.192 --> 00:04:18.339]  We just were having a debate about that because they're normalizing all of this, and they've come out and admitted it's a big article at NationalFile.com and InfoWars.com.
[00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:22.502]  It's on the World Bank site that they had developed and deployed COVID-19 in 2018.
[00:04:22.582 --> 00:04:24.904]  We actually already knew this.
[00:04:24.944 --> 00:04:28.107]  We knew that Spain a few years ago also found it in their sewage.
[00:04:29.042 --> 00:04:33.043]  We had a new scientist reported on this five years ago that it was man-made, that it was a big crime.
[00:04:33.943 --> 00:04:35.724]  I covered it all on yesterday's Sunday Show in detail.
[00:04:35.744 --> 00:04:39.985]  You really should watch that and share that if you missed it, but this is an out-of-control moment we're at.
[00:04:40.665 --> 00:04:48.987]  They are just telling us that, hey, sometimes you gotta break eggs to make an omelette, and they're normalizing mass genocide and secret medical experimentation on the people.
[00:04:49.087 --> 00:04:50.668]  And it's crimes against humanity.
[00:04:50.688 --> 00:04:54.689]  It violates the Nuremberg Code, the Geneva Convention, and it is an assault on everyone.
[00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:56.412]  We have a right to defend ourselves from assault.
[00:04:56.753 --> 00:04:57.354]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:57.694 --> 00:05:00.881]  Please stay tuned and please share this transmission, because if you're watching, you are the resistance.
[00:05:05.367 --> 00:05:08.768]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[00:05:08.788 --> 00:05:09.948]  They're going to contest the election.
[00:05:09.968 --> 00:05:11.508]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[00:05:11.708 --> 00:05:13.089]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:14.189]  I want them shut down.
[00:05:14.269 --> 00:05:15.149]  I want them silenced.
[00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:15.869]  I want them muted.
[00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:17.850]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:18.810]  You kept us on air.
[00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.211]  We did the analysis first.
[00:05:20.511 --> 00:05:21.511]  It's now gone mainstream.
[00:05:21.571 --> 00:05:23.551]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[00:05:23.651 --> 00:05:29.533]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[00:05:29.753 --> 00:05:31.213]  And you need to stop right now.
[00:05:31.313 --> 00:05:32.353]  And they're very, very serious.
[00:05:32.513 --> 00:05:34.874]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[00:05:35.014 --> 00:05:35.794]  It's not going to happen.
[00:05:35.834 --> 00:05:37.715]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[00:05:38.195 --> 00:05:39.296]  I used to say support InfoWars.
[00:05:39.736 --> 00:05:40.636]  Rescue InfoWars.
[00:05:40.716 --> 00:05:41.377]  Save yourself.
[00:05:41.717 --> 00:05:42.357]  Save the world.
[00:05:42.677 --> 00:05:43.538]  We're in this together.
[00:05:43.658 --> 00:05:45.458]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:05:45.478 --> 00:05:46.299]  Communism's up here.
[00:05:46.499 --> 00:05:49.440]  InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:51.661]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[00:05:51.861 --> 00:05:53.422]  My children are right here!
[00:05:54.142 --> 00:05:55.783]  But I need money to fight a war!
[00:05:56.103 --> 00:05:57.143]  And I need word of mouth!
[00:05:57.343 --> 00:05:58.244]  And I need prayer!
[00:05:58.504 --> 00:05:59.344]  And I need action!
[00:05:59.544 --> 00:06:01.285]  Because that dam's going to come down!
[00:06:02.045 --> 00:06:04.006]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.533]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:23.862]  Info Wars has been banned.
[00:06:23.942 --> 00:06:24.463]  Arrested.
[00:06:27.857 --> 00:06:29.178]  Attacked and threatened.
[00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:32.280]  Because we are effective.
[00:06:33.902 --> 00:06:35.403]  The Great Awakening is here.
[00:06:35.743 --> 00:06:37.444]  Go to band.video.
[00:06:38.045 --> 00:06:40.226]  Download the videos and share.
[00:06:42.148 --> 00:06:46.471]  Support the Information War at infowarestore.com.
[00:06:49.473 --> 00:06:51.214]  And never give up the fight.
[00:07:08.792 --> 00:07:11.473]  60 days out.
[00:07:11.633 --> 00:07:13.974]  September 3rd on this live Thursday transmission.
[00:07:15.154 --> 00:07:17.975]  I'm your host Alex Jones and I'm going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:07:18.235 --> 00:07:22.416]  Things are always urgent here with the transmission.
[00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.451]  The world is a very dangerous place.
[00:07:39.691 --> 00:07:52.374]  And if people aren't informed, if people aren't involved, if people aren't engaged, they always fall to nightmare tyrannies, horrible systems run by psychopaths and their devilish minions below them.
[00:07:55.675 --> 00:08:05.118]  You know, there's a lot of things I know that I'm not at liberty to tell you, but this is what I can tell you, and I think you already know this.
[00:08:08.746 --> 00:08:35.912]  For this corrupt technocracy, for this corporate anti-human world government to fully take over and carry out its devilish designs, it must, absolutely must, have America fall and have Western values of real human empowerment and Christianity
[00:08:38.874 --> 00:08:40.174]  Destroyed and devalued.
[00:08:42.015 --> 00:08:45.136]  That is the game plan, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:50.578 --> 00:08:53.578]  Now, what does it mean when the United States isn't here anymore?
[00:08:53.598 --> 00:08:56.259]  I'm gonna lay that out.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:04.862]  You know, a lot of people laugh at folks fleeing out of New York, New Jersey,
[00:09:06.457 --> 00:09:11.198]  Illinois, California, Michigan.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:20.001]  And they're not just fleeing the fact that they're poor or there's crime.
[00:09:20.421 --> 00:09:22.422]  They're fleeing because they're starving to death.
[00:09:24.142 --> 00:09:26.443]  They're fleeing because they're addicted to drugs.
[00:09:26.523 --> 00:09:28.763]  They're fleeing because they're on their last leg.
[00:09:28.783 --> 00:09:33.505]  They're fleeing because the country has been put into artificial collapse.
[00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:47.102]  And Trump was desperately trying to prop up things to at least get control of the government so we could negotiate to the Chai Koms and others because we had been positioned for total collapse and humiliation.
[00:09:48.782 --> 00:10:03.685]  But there were enough loyal forces to the Republic and to sanity and to their own self-interest who were not on the globalist payroll to rally against the NWO, whose great sin was being arrogant, and get Trump in.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:14.346]  But getting Trump in just got us back on the field to play this deadly game for all the chips and all the marbles and our children's future.
[00:10:16.127 --> 00:10:21.151]  And so, obviously, I talked to Roger Stone.
[00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:22.472]  I talked to a lot more people than that.
[00:10:22.572 --> 00:10:25.474]  And I'm going to leave it at that because I've been asked not to get into who I talked to.
[00:10:25.534 --> 00:10:29.057]  But I can tell you the president is under absolute siege.
[00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:33.112]  I can tell you the level of harassment, the things he's going through.
[00:10:33.972 --> 00:10:35.974]  I've been told, Jones, we know what you're going through.
[00:10:36.094 --> 00:10:37.454]  You're lucky you're only going through this.
[00:10:37.935 --> 00:10:40.236]  And I've been told what the president's going through.
[00:10:40.596 --> 00:10:44.379]  Directly by... I'll leave it at that.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.781]  And it's bad, folks.
[00:10:48.661 --> 00:10:50.322]  And that's why I get so mad at the Q thing.
[00:10:50.823 --> 00:10:57.427]  Not that folks are waking up and having fun with it and going and researching things and getting into their secret agents and the fun mystery of it all.
[00:10:57.847 --> 00:10:59.128]  I know what's going on.
[00:11:01.764 --> 00:11:07.328]  I really am inside of it, and it's not about me going, oh, I've got more magic contacts than people.
[00:11:07.528 --> 00:11:08.268]  That's not what this is about.
[00:11:08.609 --> 00:11:13.372]  It's about I know how much trouble this country's in, and I'm not going to lie to you about that.
[00:11:16.094 --> 00:11:18.535]  Because we need people to be engaged and informed.
[00:11:18.635 --> 00:11:20.416]  I don't tell people this stuff to scare you.
[00:11:20.536 --> 00:11:22.438]  I tell you so you can get ready and be prepared.
[00:11:22.738 --> 00:11:23.638]  Now, here's the big announcement.
[00:11:23.658 --> 00:11:28.802]  You can see the live feed of the show today has a very frightening-sounding, horrifying title, but it's true.
[00:11:32.955 --> 00:11:35.138]  Emergency broadcast.
[00:11:37.401 --> 00:11:41.386]  Globalist planning massive world depression if Trump wins or loses.
[00:11:43.769 --> 00:11:50.517]  Alex Jones is going to lay out the absolutely horrifying facts of this incredibly important Thursday transmission.
[00:11:50.637 --> 00:11:51.719]  Not to scare you, but to see.
[00:11:54.042 --> 00:11:58.686]  If you can get ready and I kind of shot that headline out as I walked in here two minutes, three minutes ago.
[00:11:59.247 --> 00:12:00.888]  So let's let's it's not a proper headline.
[00:12:00.908 --> 00:12:01.889]  I'm glad I said pull that up.
[00:12:02.349 --> 00:12:05.372]  It's not to scare you but so you can get ready.
[00:12:06.673 --> 00:12:07.434]  So you can get ready.
[00:12:08.955 --> 00:12:13.960]  So I'm working around the clock as much as I physically can in this fight.
[00:12:14.830 --> 00:12:17.991]  And I just want you to know that we rallied back.
[00:12:18.031 --> 00:12:19.651]  We took control of the country to a certain extent.
[00:12:20.331 --> 00:12:21.552]  We got the UK, Brexit.
[00:12:21.572 --> 00:12:22.512]  You've seen Bolsonaro.
[00:12:22.552 --> 00:12:24.212]  You've seen the EU's in trouble.
[00:12:24.252 --> 00:12:27.593]  But now they're launching everything they've got back at humanity.
[00:12:27.753 --> 00:12:30.574]  And they're going to contest the election.
[00:12:30.614 --> 00:12:31.514]  We first told you that.
[00:12:31.654 --> 00:12:33.095]  Now they're on record saying they're going to do it.
[00:12:33.115 --> 00:12:34.395]  They're calling it a red mirage.
[00:12:34.695 --> 00:12:36.175]  Now Facebook has joined in on it.
[00:12:36.215 --> 00:12:37.556]  We first broke that two days ago.
[00:12:38.256 --> 00:12:38.916]  It's now official.
[00:12:42.205 --> 00:12:51.707]  And they're not going to, quote, take the President's speech or his video, they're saying, if he declares victory the day after the election.
[00:12:52.307 --> 00:12:58.468]  They're telling you that they're taking control of the election and they're going to tell the public that Trump lost.
[00:13:00.189 --> 00:13:05.530]  Michael Bloomberg's own PR firm is running the entire thing and Zuckerberg just put $300 million into it.
[00:13:07.694 --> 00:13:15.719]  To push the lie that these 80 million ballots they've randomly mailed out are legitimate and we can't have the final tally till they've all been counted.
[00:13:15.779 --> 00:13:16.699]  What the hell does that mean?
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.041]  They've poisoned the well.
[00:13:22.426 --> 00:13:24.307]  So our republic is fighting for its life.
[00:13:24.427 --> 00:13:26.687]  We're in dire straits, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:13:27.347 --> 00:13:28.168]  Dire straits.
[00:13:28.848 --> 00:13:30.108]  And I need you to hit the streets.
[00:13:31.249 --> 00:13:32.349]  I need you to get involved.
[00:13:32.409 --> 00:13:41.251]  I need you to speak up and expose this and delegitimize it and circumvent their censorship and circumvent their garbage to everyone you know now if you want to win.
[00:13:42.132 --> 00:13:45.913]  Anyone telling you that this isn't a close football game is working for the enemy.
[00:13:46.713 --> 00:13:50.154]  Trump has his ads running that it's dire straits, America will end,
[00:13:51.519 --> 00:14:01.070]  That we are in incredible trouble, that the enemy is dangerous, that they will absolutely dominate and enslave you and break you financially if they get control, and it's all true.
[00:14:01.791 --> 00:14:07.958]  And then you've got other people telling you everything's fine, trust the plan, go to sleep, everything's good.
[00:14:08.058 --> 00:14:09.319]  That's not true, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:10.191 --> 00:14:11.932]  And I'm not here fighting with the Q people.
[00:14:12.352 --> 00:14:16.974]  I'm talking about folks in general that think Trump's a shoo-in and, oh, the polls show he's going to win.
[00:14:17.354 --> 00:14:21.096]  They're doing that so you are passive, and they're going to challenge it regardless.
[00:14:21.316 --> 00:14:23.957]  We've got to have the discussion about what we're going to do about that.
[00:14:25.518 --> 00:14:27.239]  And then I'll tell you this separately when we come back.
[00:14:28.819 --> 00:14:36.343]  When I tell you that there's going to be food shortages, there already are, and starvation in this country, there already is in the third world, at double the rate it was a year ago,
[00:14:37.605 --> 00:14:39.707]  That's all coming out now, but that's the facts.
[00:14:39.727 --> 00:14:50.417]  But I'm hooked in to multiple big supply chains around the country and the world, and I talk to high-level individuals that run the factories that supply the grocery stores.
[00:14:51.278 --> 00:14:57.965]  And I've got some really important news, and I'll show you news articles paralleling all of that.
[00:14:59.551 --> 00:15:09.439]  As well, guys, when you pulled me out of yesterday's stack, that big food shortage, food line breakdown, the food pantries running out and the supply chains breaking down, stack, thank you.
[00:15:11.681 --> 00:15:19.888]  But before I get to all that when we come back, I'm just going to tell you about what InfoWars is going through behind the scenes.
[00:15:20.708 --> 00:15:22.370]  And I try to just leave that out.
[00:15:23.302 --> 00:15:26.883]  Because it really makes the enemy happy to tune in and you'll hear about what they're doing, what they're up to.
[00:15:27.343 --> 00:15:31.864]  But I mean, at this point you need to know, because it's Alamo-level stuff, okay?
[00:15:32.624 --> 00:15:37.565]  And I've sent my letters out, I've asked for reinforcements, and I'm asking those reinforcements from you.
[00:15:38.385 --> 00:15:41.406]  And you have to understand that this is a very serious situation.
[00:15:41.886 --> 00:15:49.088]  Now, beyond that, they've officially announced to the state government of Ohio FEMA camps for people who they think
[00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:50.970]  You see this ad?
[00:15:51.011 --> 00:15:51.791]  I wrote it about a week ago.
[00:15:51.811 --> 00:15:53.752]  And I believe every single word in it.
[00:16:09.457 --> 00:16:17.867]  The safest bet you can make in the world right now is getting high quality, storable food at a low price because the future is so uncertain.
[00:16:18.488 --> 00:16:25.275]  The entire new order operation is about making you dependent and making you domesticated where you're not self-sufficient.
[00:16:25.856 --> 00:16:29.639]  The number one thing you need is a relationship with God and self-defense.
[00:16:30.479 --> 00:16:33.021]  After that comes food and water.
[00:16:33.341 --> 00:16:38.945]  We've got the best storable food and the best water filters in-house and portable at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:16:39.265 --> 00:16:41.346]  And we have the storable food in stock.
[00:16:41.567 --> 00:16:45.169]  All the other big competitors have sold out or have like 10-week waiting periods.
[00:16:45.409 --> 00:16:45.789]  We don't.
[00:16:46.290 --> 00:16:47.931]  One to two weeks to ship to you.
[00:16:48.151 --> 00:16:48.951]  We have the food.
[00:16:49.212 --> 00:16:50.232]  We've got to get it packaged.
[00:16:50.472 --> 00:16:54.015]  It's the biggest company in the world because they've got the name because they're trusted.
[00:16:54.455 --> 00:16:55.736]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:16:56.456 --> 00:16:59.878]  Get prepared now before the globalists go completely crazy.
[00:16:59.938 --> 00:17:00.738]  Get ready now.
[00:17:15.704 --> 00:17:16.544]  Man, come on, man.
[00:17:16.564 --> 00:17:18.785]  I ain't finna go Alex Jones level with y'all, man.
[00:17:18.805 --> 00:17:19.425]  Come on, man.
[00:17:19.445 --> 00:17:23.146]  What y'all... Like... Wake up!
[00:17:23.166 --> 00:17:24.467]  I want people to wake up right now.
[00:17:25.418 --> 00:17:27.760]  I want people to listen to me and just come out of your trance.
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.803]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
[00:17:31.843 --> 00:17:32.724]  White males!
[00:17:32.744 --> 00:17:37.827]  So Alex Jones' whole brand is based around the idea that he's giving you the real story, not the fake news out there.
[00:17:37.847 --> 00:17:38.608]  Hey, listen!
[00:17:38.688 --> 00:17:39.649]  I'm here to warn people!
[00:17:39.669 --> 00:17:40.950]  You keep telling me to shut up!
[00:17:41.250 --> 00:17:42.191]  This isn't a game!
[00:17:42.731 --> 00:17:44.192]  Humanity is awakening!
[00:17:44.412 --> 00:17:45.453]  InfoWars.com!
[00:17:45.953 --> 00:17:47.575]  This is Alex Jones.
[00:17:48.095 --> 00:17:48.735]  Pirates did it.
[00:17:48.995 --> 00:17:49.936]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:17:50.196 --> 00:17:51.217]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:17:51.537 --> 00:17:52.397]  Mao took the guns.
[00:17:52.697 --> 00:17:57.980]  And I'm here to tell you, 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:17:58.840]  Alex Jones!
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.841]  Infowars.com I just don't know who you are.
[00:18:00.861 --> 00:18:01.661]  You guys know who he is?
[00:18:01.701 --> 00:18:03.202]  You know Alex Jones says Infowars?
[00:18:03.222 --> 00:18:05.463]  Very popular.
[00:18:05.483 --> 00:18:08.605]  Infowars, it's a radio show hosted by Alex Jones.
[00:18:08.845 --> 00:18:10.926]  You need to listen to Alex Jones.
[00:18:11.106 --> 00:18:12.426]  We know we're under attack!
[00:18:12.506 --> 00:18:13.367]  We know it!
[00:18:13.527 --> 00:18:14.908]  We're breaking the conditioning!
[00:18:18.044 --> 00:18:19.584]  I'm talking about Alex Jones.
[00:18:19.744 --> 00:18:20.284]  InfoWars.
[00:18:20.424 --> 00:18:21.145]  Alex Jones.
[00:18:21.285 --> 00:18:21.645]  InfoWars.
[00:18:21.725 --> 00:18:22.545]  Alex Jones.
[00:18:27.926 --> 00:18:28.906]  That's just level one.
[00:18:29.146 --> 00:18:29.626]  What's level two?
[00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:30.366]  I'll tell you.
[00:18:30.766 --> 00:18:34.727]  The animated contest of liberty is waiting for you.
[00:18:34.767 --> 00:18:38.308]  But you've got to take it in your hands.
[00:18:38.708 --> 00:18:43.649]  You've got to have the will to accept the truth and fuck the system and the group collective.
[00:18:43.829 --> 00:18:46.129]  Do that and you'll earn your way to the next level.
[00:18:47.874 --> 00:18:48.826]  This is the info.
[00:19:04.716 --> 00:19:05.676]  Living Defense.
[00:19:05.936 --> 00:19:07.157]  This is beyond a probiotic.
[00:19:07.197 --> 00:19:13.358]  It's got all these things known to flush out the bad little visitors in the guts and really get your guts up to optimum condition.
[00:19:13.398 --> 00:19:15.139]  And have you ever thought probiotics were amazing?
[00:19:15.159 --> 00:19:15.539]  Which they aren't.
[00:19:15.879 --> 00:19:18.040]  This is next level and does it a different way.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:19.740]  It targets and gets rid of bad guys.
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:21.101]  It doesn't promote the good guys.
[00:19:21.121 --> 00:19:23.861]  Because when you get rid of the bad guys, the good guys can operate.
[00:19:23.901 --> 00:19:25.102]  The new allure is targeting your gut.
[00:19:25.182 --> 00:19:27.182]  Living Defense is the best, most powerful formula.
[00:19:27.302 --> 00:19:28.343]  And it is a big bottle.
[00:19:28.523 --> 00:19:29.443]  Let me show TV viewers this.
[00:19:30.023 --> 00:19:30.683]  It's a brand new bottle.
[00:19:30.703 --> 00:19:32.184]  Remember, I haven't taken this in about six months.
[00:19:32.284 --> 00:19:33.224]  I take it about twice a year.
[00:19:33.484 --> 00:19:33.864]  Look at this.
[00:19:34.004 --> 00:19:34.564]  Look at that.
[00:19:34.644 --> 00:19:34.984]  Look at this.
[00:19:35.024 --> 00:19:36.404]  Damn, it's going all over the floor everywhere.
[00:19:36.424 --> 00:19:37.145]  There's so many of them.
[00:19:37.305 --> 00:19:37.785]  Hold on.
[00:19:37.825 --> 00:19:38.265]  There you go.
[00:19:38.385 --> 00:19:39.405]  I mean, what's on the floor?
[00:19:39.485 --> 00:19:40.485]  These babies are amazing.
[00:19:40.525 --> 00:19:45.507]  You take a few of these a day for a month, you're going to have some results that are, let's just say, magnificent.
[00:19:45.687 --> 00:19:47.787]  And this is Mother Nature gave us.
[00:19:47.887 --> 00:19:48.887]  God gave us Mother Nature.
[00:19:48.907 --> 00:19:51.068]  It is LivingDefenseInfoWarStore.com.
[00:19:51.208 --> 00:19:54.369]  And you fund the Info War, so it's a total win-win, win-win-win.
[00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:55.609]  InfoWarStore.com.
[00:20:04.921 --> 00:20:09.006]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:09.527 --> 00:20:10.809]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.288]  It is Thursday, September 3rd, 60 days out from the election.
[00:20:58.328 --> 00:20:59.651]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:21:00.152 --> 00:21:04.542]  All right, I've got an incredible amount of world news that brings into crisp focus
[00:21:05.643 --> 00:21:13.967]  What we told you was coming from Spain and Australia, North Korea and China under UN directives was being beta tested there and is now here in the United States.
[00:21:13.987 --> 00:21:32.895]  They've announced that Democrat state governors will begin forcibly arresting you if a contact tracer, which is a former Clinton-level initiative or Obama Corps member, saw you have sniffles, cough, or if you say you have a sore throat, you will then be forcibly taken
[00:21:34.202 --> 00:21:39.526]  Uh, to a jail cell at a FEMA camp that they've gotten FEMA to agree to fund.
[00:21:39.606 --> 00:21:42.929]  So, uh, mainstream news, started getting text messages last night.
[00:21:43.049 --> 00:21:44.150]  Ohio Department of Health.
[00:21:45.011 --> 00:21:47.032]  The article's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:21:47.752 --> 00:21:52.453]  Ohio Department of Health partners with FEMA to create shelter facilities for people exposed to COVID-19.
[00:21:52.493 --> 00:21:53.193]  Notice exposed.
[00:21:53.513 --> 00:21:54.314]  You're not even tested.
[00:21:54.354 --> 00:22:03.196]  They just take you if you, quote, have symptoms, and they say the symptoms are coughing, runny nose, anything else with the borders the Democrats want to keep wide open.
[00:22:03.216 --> 00:22:04.616]  That's coming up next segment.
[00:22:04.996 --> 00:22:08.577]  We have a guest on from Australia about they didn't just go arrest one lady.
[00:22:08.657 --> 00:22:09.838]  Oh, they were busy beavers.
[00:22:10.638 --> 00:22:20.648]  Going to the houses of 80 plus people that dared to speak out against the unending COVID lockdown, or to point out the CDC's own numbers that 90 plus percent of the tests are false positive.
[00:22:22.129 --> 00:22:23.270]  That's now all over the news.
[00:22:23.310 --> 00:22:25.973]  They tried to suppress it since last weekend, but that failed.
[00:22:28.175 --> 00:22:32.198]  And we've got massive election meddling by
[00:22:33.513 --> 00:22:41.514]  The Democrats and how they openly are saying they plan to scuttle the election, and now it's not my analysis from a year ago or more.
[00:22:41.554 --> 00:22:43.955]  Now it's public, so we've got big developments on that front.
[00:22:44.475 --> 00:22:49.556]  Facebook joins red mirage plot, won't allow false victory claims from Trump on election night.
[00:22:50.196 --> 00:23:00.358]  They also says that Facebook declares Kyle Rittenhouse actions mass murder, and says his lawyers aren't allowed to speak, he is not allowed to speak, and no one is allowed to raise him money for his defense.
[00:23:00.518 --> 00:23:01.858]  Though the Weathermen they think are wonderful.
[00:23:02.839 --> 00:23:05.525]  And of course, Twitter won't let his lawyer speak either.
[00:23:06.587 --> 00:23:11.076]  And, I mean, this is the total management control of what we're going under.
[00:23:12.233 --> 00:23:15.454]  Because we put up with it, and Congress put up with it, and Trump put up with it.
[00:23:15.554 --> 00:23:20.336]  Big tech is racketeering internationally, like they've done in China to suppress the population.
[00:23:20.936 --> 00:23:26.978]  It is racketeering, organized crime practices, just like Hitler did when he first got in control of Germany.
[00:23:27.018 --> 00:23:32.040]  He took away banking of people, he took away businesses, he took away people's right to contract, and that's their plan.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.921]  And that brings me next to this issue.
[00:23:35.322 --> 00:23:42.745]  You've heard how they're targeting all these conservatives, not letting them have GoFundMe accounts, and then if another group funds them, they take the bank account away from that group.
[00:23:43.425 --> 00:23:45.246]  That's what they've done to everybody.
[00:23:45.826 --> 00:23:48.027]  And what they've done to Laura Loomer, they've done to us.
[00:23:48.267 --> 00:23:55.289]  I've just not made a big deal about it and found some workarounds, but they are rapidly closing those as well.
[00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:57.150]  Also,
[00:23:58.337 --> 00:24:01.538]  I'll cover this more in the last segment of this hour because it's really important for everybody to know.
[00:24:01.959 --> 00:24:08.001]  I wouldn't get up here and tell you there's going to be food shortages and food spike increases and the cost of food just for no reason.
[00:24:08.021 --> 00:24:11.183]  I would tell you that because I really have the sources and the research and the info.
[00:24:11.543 --> 00:24:13.564]  Now I told you that eight months ago, now it's all public.
[00:24:14.364 --> 00:24:14.824]  It's happening.
[00:24:15.545 --> 00:24:16.185]  And people aren't...
[00:24:17.739 --> 00:24:21.220]  Just moving to Texas and the Midwest and the South because they're sick of where they live.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:22.740]  They don't have work.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:23.520]  They don't have jobs.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.740]  It's all shut down.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:25.940]  It's ghost towns.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.541]  These are refugees.
[00:24:28.241 --> 00:24:30.761]  And the third world is collapsing and more refugees are coming.
[00:24:31.101 --> 00:24:33.002]  This is the organized collapse of the West.
[00:24:33.062 --> 00:24:34.242]  The globalists don't want wealth.
[00:24:34.862 --> 00:24:35.562]  They don't want choice.
[00:24:35.582 --> 00:24:36.302]  They don't want independence.
[00:24:36.322 --> 00:24:39.783]  They want vertical, consolidated integration for a technocracy.
[00:24:39.863 --> 00:24:47.004]  So... But I tell you... But I tell you that
[00:24:48.399 --> 00:24:53.001]  You need to get ready, and you need to be very busy telling folks about Infowars.com.
[00:24:53.041 --> 00:24:59.204]  It's because being prepared is key, and spreading the word about the broadcast that is the antidote to the globalist poison is key.
[00:25:00.084 --> 00:25:11.550]  And I know you know that, but I'm telling you, we have seven major suppliers and a couple of smaller suppliers of high-quality organic and wild harvested, top-of-the-line supplements that we get
[00:25:12.455 --> 00:25:12.935]  We're good to go.
[00:25:28.374 --> 00:25:37.120]  Of the 7, now 5 are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 months behind, and now they're just saying, hey, we're going to have to give you back the money you put as a down payment on that.
[00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:39.101]  We just can't open.
[00:25:39.161 --> 00:25:40.022]  Nothing's coming in.
[00:25:40.482 --> 00:25:42.984]  It's not being produced in the raw areas.
[00:25:43.784 --> 00:25:47.046]  If one person gets COVID, nobody dies, but the whole plant has to shut down.
[00:25:47.066 --> 00:25:49.908]  And it's happening to food distribution centers.
[00:25:49.948 --> 00:25:51.049]  It's happening to warehouses.
[00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:57.013]  It's why you can't get a lot of furniture you want to order, or just all sorts of things you want aren't there anymore.
[00:25:59.085 --> 00:26:03.728]  And so the globalists want a global depression, whether Trump gets in or out.
[00:26:03.928 --> 00:26:05.509]  He's trying to prop it up, he's trying to save it.
[00:26:05.709 --> 00:26:06.909]  We want to elect Trump, that's great.
[00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:20.196]  But all of this COVID lockdown and going after the dollar and all the media attacking the dollar and attacking the stock market, that's part of a larger plan to bring us into a depression for four or five years, to bring in contact tracing.
[00:26:20.457 --> 00:26:21.617]  It's the Marshall Law cover.
[00:26:21.637 --> 00:26:26.200]  They're not going to give you a depression and say, we're going to track you now, where you go and what you do for political reasons.
[00:26:27.442 --> 00:26:29.524]  It's been done for COVID, but don't leave your house.
[00:26:29.804 --> 00:26:32.145]  You can't have a rally unless it's one of our rallies.
[00:26:32.946 --> 00:26:35.648]  Whether it's Europe or Australia or the U.S., you know, this is the same.
[00:26:36.929 --> 00:26:41.492]  This is how they freeze the opposition, the nationalists, the patriots, the counter-revolution with COVID.
[00:26:42.312 --> 00:26:43.413]  And they freeze your businesses.
[00:26:43.493 --> 00:26:44.154]  You're not essential.
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:48.081]  While they destroy your currency and bring you to your knees.
[00:26:48.121 --> 00:26:50.482]  So horrible times are coming.
[00:26:51.362 --> 00:26:52.522]  Absolute hell on earth.
[00:26:53.243 --> 00:26:56.064]  And maybe if Trump gets elected we can have a soft landing.
[00:26:56.424 --> 00:26:57.864]  But I don't think so.
[00:26:58.004 --> 00:26:59.365]  And I just have to tell you the truth.
[00:26:59.685 --> 00:27:02.666]  I just can't soften stuff for you and I can't lie to you.
[00:27:03.226 --> 00:27:05.808]  That's why the enemy wants you to think everything's handled, everything's great.
[00:27:06.169 --> 00:27:06.769]  It's not great.
[00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:09.491]  They purposely collapsed all the blue cities and blue states.
[00:27:10.032 --> 00:27:10.973]  It is hell on earth.
[00:27:11.433 --> 00:27:13.595]  There are thousands of suicides a day.
[00:27:14.696 --> 00:27:17.979]  There are tens of thousands a week of drug overdoses.
[00:27:18.779 --> 00:27:20.801]  The media has pedophilia all over it.
[00:27:21.081 --> 00:27:22.743]  They are breaking our will right now.
[00:27:22.843 --> 00:27:24.144]  I don't believe they're going to win in the end.
[00:27:24.784 --> 00:27:27.407]  God promised that, but you have to know that
[00:27:28.868 --> 00:27:33.753]  People are in for a rude awakening, so you need to get your storable food at InfoWareStore.com right now.
[00:27:33.813 --> 00:27:35.554]  They have the food one to two weeks.
[00:27:35.674 --> 00:27:36.975]  They built their supply chain up.
[00:27:37.016 --> 00:27:39.778]  They expanded when others contracted in the last eight months.
[00:27:40.339 --> 00:27:46.144]  But I guarantee you, when people figure this out, they're going to end up at eight weeks, ten weeks, twelve weeks, and stop sales again like they did.
[00:27:46.805 --> 00:27:54.592]  They believe, and I believe, that by January of next year, even though Trump will hopefully be inaugurated, that the global depression is going to be so evident
[00:27:56.072 --> 00:27:59.985]  And the left's going to keep the riots going, and the breakdown of supply chains is going to be so evident, and the...
[00:28:01.869 --> 00:28:09.552]  You know, people think in the world's ending, because it kind of is in a way, not having the infrastructure operate, the supply chain is going to break down massively, as it already has, but even worse.
[00:28:10.052 --> 00:28:19.736]  So, I'm telling you, if you want to get the supplements, and you want to get the t-shirts, and the books, the films, there could very easily come a point where we can't get any of these items.
[00:28:19.756 --> 00:28:25.439]  Because a lot of them, you notice of our catalog of 60 plus items, like 9 or 10 are already gone.
[00:28:25.959 --> 00:28:27.139]  And a lot of them were big sellers.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:28.180]  You can't get it.
[00:28:29.801 --> 00:28:30.561]  You can't get it.
[00:28:31.869 --> 00:28:32.990]  Especially complex formulas.
[00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:35.051]  There's something like 8-Pak PowerSec that became very popular.
[00:28:35.271 --> 00:28:36.132]  It's got 13 pills.
[00:28:36.632 --> 00:28:37.092]  13 different things.
[00:28:37.133 --> 00:28:38.694]  Four or five of them we can't get.
[00:28:38.734 --> 00:28:42.356]  So that product, what we've got is what we've got.
[00:28:42.796 --> 00:28:43.737]  This is bad, folks.
[00:28:43.937 --> 00:28:45.378]  I have to run my own infrastructure.
[00:28:45.398 --> 00:28:46.259]  I'm not just a talk show host.
[00:28:46.359 --> 00:28:47.339]  I know business.
[00:28:47.379 --> 00:28:48.540]  I know infrastructure.
[00:28:48.600 --> 00:28:49.361]  I'm involved in everything.
[00:28:50.081 --> 00:28:50.982]  That's just the way God had it.
[00:28:51.002 --> 00:28:53.423]  I was trained by necessity in all of this.
[00:28:54.144 --> 00:28:56.305]  Pulled myself up by my bootstraps with your help together.
[00:28:56.365 --> 00:29:01.789]  But I'm telling you, you need to get the supplements because I don't even know how long we can operate it in the future.
[00:29:18.493 --> 00:29:22.656]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[00:29:23.377 --> 00:29:31.583]  So everything InfoWars has done for 26 years, everything you've done in your life of being informed and being involved, is building towards this point, and this isn't a normal time.
[00:29:31.804 --> 00:29:32.664]  And I know you know that.
[00:29:33.345 --> 00:29:34.486]  And I salute you and I thank you.
[00:29:35.547 --> 00:29:40.871]  But when you call in thanking me for trying to self-preserve myself and you, we're in the same boat, brother.
[00:29:42.261 --> 00:29:57.426]  So I get it, I appreciate you just as much as you appreciate me, but I'm telling you, now is the time, because I need to know, I gotta decide the next week, with what we've got in our coffers, with only enough to operate, if I sold both my houses to pay for this place, it would not operate us for a month and a half.
[00:29:57.866 --> 00:30:00.387]  I don't, I'm not rich, I don't have all this money the media says I have, okay?
[00:30:01.307 --> 00:30:06.709]  Got a nice truck, a nice car, stuff like that, I got insurance for my kids, I'm doing well, I don't care, I don't need more, I'm happy.
[00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:11.191]  But if you go to InfoWareStore.com, you see the Support Us,
[00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:14.011]  Link over on the right-hand side.
[00:30:15.551 --> 00:30:19.312]  And if you click on that, you'll find the different websites and the donation page.
[00:30:19.532 --> 00:30:20.513]  They're there to support us.
[00:30:21.273 --> 00:30:22.833]  Right there, click on that on the right-hand side.
[00:30:23.473 --> 00:30:26.254]  But you need a four-stage ion filter.
[00:30:26.414 --> 00:30:28.895]  We have the best at the lowest price, because that's what I do!
[00:30:28.915 --> 00:30:34.217]  We have the best tolerable food, highest quality you're gonna get, unless you pay five times more.
[00:30:35.177 --> 00:30:36.198]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:36.939 --> 00:30:37.640]  The best prices.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:38.541]  It's all there.
[00:30:38.962 --> 00:30:41.325]  But we've only got the ability to do business now.
[00:30:42.146 --> 00:30:43.507]  We're not going to have it much longer.
[00:30:44.288 --> 00:30:45.329]  If the enemy has their way.
[00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:47.032]  I'm telling you.
[00:30:47.572 --> 00:30:48.954]  I used to say support InfoWars.
[00:30:49.394 --> 00:30:50.275]  Rescue InfoWars.
[00:30:50.376 --> 00:30:51.016]  Save yourself.
[00:30:51.377 --> 00:30:52.018]  Save the world.
[00:30:52.338 --> 00:30:53.199]  We're in this together.
[00:30:53.499 --> 00:30:54.801]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:30:54.921 --> 00:30:55.901]  Communism's up here.
[00:30:56.122 --> 00:30:59.083]  Infowars is the damn blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[00:30:59.463 --> 00:31:01.284]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[00:31:01.504 --> 00:31:03.025]  My children are right here!
[00:31:03.745 --> 00:31:09.307]  With pedophiles and devil worshippers and forced inoculations and FEMA camps coming for us and war!
[00:31:10.248 --> 00:31:12.268]  If we don't fix this now, we're gonna have to fight.
[00:31:14.349 --> 00:31:15.830]  You know, I really need to repent.
[00:31:15.970 --> 00:31:16.750]  It's a sick part of me.
[00:31:16.770 --> 00:31:17.931]  I just hope it goes down.
[00:31:22.659 --> 00:31:32.722]  Because all you devil worshippers and trash that have been pushing and pushing and pushing forever, you better hope you fail in your operation and you don't push us into the fire.
[00:31:32.742 --> 00:31:37.703]  Because I swear on the altar of God, you will pay.
[00:31:37.723 --> 00:31:40.764]  And quite frankly, I'm so alive right now.
[00:31:40.804 --> 00:31:45.685]  I'm so glad Soros and Bill Gates hate me.
[00:31:45.765 --> 00:31:48.746]  That's the greatest honor in my life.
[00:31:49.346 --> 00:31:51.767]  It's the greatest thing in my life next to my children.
[00:31:52.759 --> 00:31:57.281]  That I'm real, I'm all in, and you know me by my enemies, and I know our audience of activists.
[00:31:57.861 --> 00:32:02.843]  It's you they hate, because they don't have your will, they don't have your soul, they don't have your heart.
[00:32:03.083 --> 00:32:04.604]  They don't control your destiny!
[00:32:05.124 --> 00:32:06.845]  They sure as hell don't control mine!
[00:32:08.063 --> 00:32:11.807]  So we're trying to hold the dam against the Satanists and the armies of hell.
[00:32:12.008 --> 00:32:17.614]  We pray to Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father for the lead God to direct us against this enemy!
[00:32:18.255 --> 00:32:19.977]  But I need money to fight a war!
[00:32:20.197 --> 00:32:21.218]  And I need word of mouth!
[00:32:21.459 --> 00:32:22.320]  And I need prayer!
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:23.441]  And I need action!
[00:32:23.861 --> 00:32:25.383]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[00:32:26.244 --> 00:32:27.764]  That dam's already got holes in it.
[00:32:28.265 --> 00:32:32.266]  And the enemy's telling you, don't stick your fingers in it, don't block it, everything's fine.
[00:32:32.446 --> 00:32:34.526]  Peaches and cream are on the other side.
[00:32:34.727 --> 00:32:35.307]  No!
[00:32:35.807 --> 00:32:37.607]  You know it's not peaches and cream!
[00:32:37.827 --> 00:32:39.788]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[00:32:40.568 --> 00:32:41.489]  One way or another!
[00:32:42.589 --> 00:32:47.770]  Only question is, do we have a president in the middle of the fight against the new world order, or is it going to be us that does it?
[00:32:48.391 --> 00:32:49.631]  But we know we're not giving up!
[00:32:51.658 --> 00:32:52.519]  September 3rd.
[00:33:23.211 --> 00:33:25.213]  It's a Thursday.
[00:33:25.233 --> 00:33:25.773]  60 days now.
[00:33:25.893 --> 00:33:32.838]  Do I feel sorry for Infowars that we've been persecuted and attacked and lied about and how they've battled to shut us down?
[00:33:33.539 --> 00:33:42.806]  No, I feel sorry for the children of this country and the world being subjected to brainwashing and poison vaccines and fluoride and pedophilia and devil worship.
[00:33:43.971 --> 00:33:52.978]  So before I cover some really dark, scary news, not to scare you, but to help you get ready, we've got something live for you, dealing with our little buddy, Brian Stelter.
[00:33:52.998 --> 00:33:58.261]  A new take on our Mars attacks, don't run, we are your friend parable.
[00:34:01.144 --> 00:34:11.131]  So I would say, you know, if anything that's happening at CNN and anybody who buys your book, it's really just one of those things that is dividing our nation.
[00:34:11.938 --> 00:34:13.980]  And I don't believe in dividing our nation.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.242]  It hurts our great nation.
[00:34:16.002 --> 00:34:19.146]  And so, CNN is really the enemy of the truth.
[00:34:19.506 --> 00:34:20.347]  And that's my opinion.
[00:34:20.687 --> 00:34:21.028]  Thank you.
[00:34:22.129 --> 00:34:24.571]  No American is an enemy of another American.
[00:34:24.912 --> 00:34:27.174]  No news outlet is an enemy of America.
[00:34:39.128 --> 00:34:46.274]  No news outlet is an enemy of America.
[00:34:46.294 --> 00:34:48.796]  They came in peace.
[00:34:48.896 --> 00:34:49.217]  Huh?
[00:35:18.894 --> 00:35:21.234]  No news outlet is an enemy of America!
[00:35:21.475 --> 00:35:22.755]  Bill Gates wants you!
[00:35:22.975 --> 00:35:23.715]  Take the vaccine!
[00:35:23.735 --> 00:35:24.515]  Don't run!
[00:35:24.535 --> 00:35:25.395]  CNN's your friend!
[00:35:25.415 --> 00:35:26.656]  This is CNN.
[00:35:26.736 --> 00:35:28.456]  Facebook's Taiwan!
[00:35:28.496 --> 00:35:29.256]  Globalist.
[00:35:49.656 --> 00:35:58.860]  We want corporate slaves so you can be phased out in an orderly fashion.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:09.084]  And, again, you can see the disaster, you can see the breakdown for yourself, you can see this is 21st century war that our republic and the whole planet is in.
[00:36:09.925 --> 00:36:17.428]  But if they can gaslight everyone through corporate control, through big tech, and tell you, don't believe your lying eyes, don't believe your empty stomach,
[00:36:20.259 --> 00:36:21.360]  Then they believe they can win.
[00:36:22.941 --> 00:36:32.128]  The minute they thought they got the West in enough debt with fiat currency, these private banks signed us on to, they had the Great Reset.
[00:36:32.608 --> 00:36:46.199]  And we told you eight months ago in pieces we put out, seven months ago, February and March, called the Great Resets, that this was a Great Reset, that they were using COVID to bring in the global depression and the post-industrial world.
[00:36:47.765 --> 00:36:51.695]  And then within two months of us telling you that's what this was, they came out.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.942]  Klaus Schwab, the head of Davos, all of them, and said exactly that.
[00:36:57.342 --> 00:36:59.163]  And it's not, again, that we're that smart.
[00:36:59.243 --> 00:37:01.104]  We know their game plan.
[00:37:01.144 --> 00:37:03.245]  We understand their operations.
[00:37:03.285 --> 00:37:04.806]  We've done our research.
[00:37:05.346 --> 00:37:16.012]  And did you know that almost every major nationalist or conservative or patriot leader in the world has either been arrested or harassed or sued or had their bank accounts taken away?
[00:37:16.032 --> 00:37:19.313]  You go, how is it happening in the UK and Brazil and the US?
[00:37:19.333 --> 00:37:20.054]  Don't they have leaders?
[00:37:20.816 --> 00:37:24.538]  We have corporate governance, and the libertarians were fooled.
[00:37:24.638 --> 00:37:25.178]  I was fooled.
[00:37:26.159 --> 00:37:36.284]  The big think tanks are like, oh, the state withers away, and then it's this corporate utopia where you have all these choices, but instead the corporations get together and form their own government.
[00:37:37.304 --> 00:37:43.988]  Being a, quote, libertarian, fiscally, economically, was the dumbest thing I ever did.
[00:37:44.966 --> 00:37:47.048]  And Tucker Carlson admits that he was an idiot as well.
[00:37:47.108 --> 00:37:49.369]  But you buy into it, they've got the big D.C.
[00:37:49.410 --> 00:37:52.292]  think tanks, and, oh yeah, the state will just wither away.
[00:37:52.312 --> 00:37:55.935]  No, you get a bigger state that corporations control to control you.
[00:37:56.735 --> 00:38:00.598]  And then if the state gets out of hand, they just break it up, and they operate as a government.
[00:38:01.719 --> 00:38:11.267]  And that's how they're doing it, just like Hitler did, and just like the Bolsheviks did, where they wouldn't let anybody that wasn't part of their party, even if you submitted to them, it didn't matter, you'd be their slave.
[00:38:11.747 --> 00:38:14.049]  But if you were a party member, then you could have bank accounts.
[00:38:15.458 --> 00:38:16.758]  Then you could have commerce.
[00:38:17.018 --> 00:38:18.179]  Everyone had to come to you.
[00:38:18.979 --> 00:38:23.640]  Just like when George Washington wasn't a nobleman by blood, so he couldn't open a business.
[00:38:26.261 --> 00:38:27.802]  He couldn't even throw an official party.
[00:38:29.022 --> 00:38:31.183]  You had to get a nobleman to come to your party to have a party.
[00:38:33.603 --> 00:38:37.825]  You had to go through them to even have a job or be able to sell land.
[00:38:39.685 --> 00:38:42.026]  So that's all these fascists and communists recreate.
[00:38:44.133 --> 00:38:59.477]  Is a system where you have to go through them, and then once they've got you with big tech and all the rest of it, oh, you're not gonna have the lawyer on Facebook or Twitter saying, it turns out Kyle Rittenhouse was being chased and attacked and they were trying to grab his gun and saying, kill him.
[00:39:01.898 --> 00:39:05.859]  You don't get a defense, your lawyer doesn't get a voice in America.
[00:39:07.239 --> 00:39:11.440]  I mean, this is absolutely getting out of control.
[00:39:13.705 --> 00:39:15.447]  And notice it's every aspect of life.
[00:39:16.107 --> 00:39:36.503]  And hundreds of thousands of paid ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center trained individuals like Bolsheviks, commissars, are now in control of all of big tech and media, interfaced with CNN and MSNBC, saying what can and can't be said from Australia to the UK to Spain to the United States to Canada.
[00:39:36.863 --> 00:39:40.246]  And they're coming to people's houses and making mass arrests.
[00:39:41.354 --> 00:39:52.000]  In Australia, and in Spain, and now in England, and in Scotland, other stacks of news are just arresting everybody, if you criticize the government, or political correctness, or COVID.
[00:39:53.361 --> 00:40:03.646]  And when the CDC came out and said 90 plus percent of the tests are fake, false positives, and 90 plus percent, 94 percent, had comorbidity, they censored all that!
[00:40:07.248 --> 00:40:09.790]  Thomas Jefferson was famously asked, what is the limit?
[00:40:10.714 --> 00:40:14.335]  To which, tyrants will take us.
[00:40:14.395 --> 00:40:15.875]  And he said, the limit you will accept.
[00:40:15.915 --> 00:40:17.396]  And that's absolutely true.
[00:40:18.976 --> 00:40:20.697]  And so we're going into slavery.
[00:40:20.777 --> 00:40:27.498]  High-tech, horrible, with a fascist control system above it, a technocracy, with a communist ideology below it.
[00:40:30.479 --> 00:40:33.020]  With a dumbed down, mindless, divided population.
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:37.041]  So, I don't tell you all of that.
[00:40:39.005 --> 00:40:45.089]  To scare you, I tell you, so that you understand, the more you give in, the worse it gets.
[00:40:45.169 --> 00:40:46.850]  Look at this graphic I've got right over here.
[00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:47.611]  I'm going to walk over here.
[00:40:48.812 --> 00:40:51.173]  Communism is behind the Hoover Dam.
[00:40:52.774 --> 00:40:57.778]  Hundreds of billions of gallons of water that could be life-giving to crops and humans and more.
[00:40:58.258 --> 00:41:02.541]  Unless it's unleashed in an improper way, it'll destroy the lives of tens of thousands of people.
[00:41:02.581 --> 00:41:04.182]  It'll kill thousands of people.
[00:41:04.542 --> 00:41:05.083]  It's a weapon!
[00:41:06.178 --> 00:41:10.959]  Communism is held back by Infowars, and by your resistance, and by your prayer, and by Trump.
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:12.200]  But here it is.
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:16.201]  Communism's up here behind the dam, you've got Infowars holding it back, and you're down here.
[00:41:17.401 --> 00:41:21.763]  And just like Donald Trump told you, they're not after him, they're coming for you.
[00:41:23.243 --> 00:41:24.003]  And this is real.
[00:41:24.023 --> 00:41:29.285]  So I'm going to tell you again, because the straits are dire for everybody, but they really want Infowars off the air.
[00:41:31.770 --> 00:41:42.114]  If you want to get the supplements, or the books, or the t-shirts, or the films, or the high-quality affordable food, it's all in stock now, but a lot of the supplements won't be there in the future.
[00:41:43.355 --> 00:41:45.636]  The food is there for now, one to two weeks delivery.
[00:41:45.896 --> 00:41:47.637]  You need to get your orders in, not just for you.
[00:41:48.965 --> 00:41:54.350]  I don't know how long we'll be able to continue operating this system and self-funding.
[00:41:54.530 --> 00:42:02.457]  They've taken our sponsors, they've taken everything away, and they are behind the scenes running intelligence operations against us to sabotage and shut us down.
[00:42:03.478 --> 00:42:07.081]  And at a date in the future, I'll be able to tell you about it, or you'll see it on the news, okay?
[00:42:08.442 --> 00:42:09.243]  You see what's going on.
[00:42:09.943 --> 00:42:11.404]  You need to get your orders in now.
[00:42:11.485 --> 00:42:15.508]  It's a patriotic duty for yourself and the world, the country, and common sense.
[00:42:15.568 --> 00:42:18.390]  And you need to understand, I've never lied to you consciously.
[00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:19.131]  I've made mistakes.
[00:42:19.511 --> 00:42:24.135]  But Infowars, on a scale of 1 to 10, our worst threats before were a 2.
[00:42:24.796 --> 00:42:25.616]  This is a 9.
[00:42:27.338 --> 00:42:32.422]  They've got people out on the street, ladies and gentlemen, with contracts out to kill me.
[00:42:33.163 --> 00:42:33.363]  Okay?
[00:42:34.383 --> 00:42:35.223]  It's all coming down.
[00:42:35.263 --> 00:42:45.009]  They're trying to indict the entire Trump family right now in the Southern District of New York and also in the state with the Attorney General, the minion of Soros, Letitia James.
[00:42:45.449 --> 00:42:46.470]  They're going after everybody.
[00:42:46.690 --> 00:42:47.770]  This is a real war.
[00:42:48.311 --> 00:42:50.892]  And I need capital to go into next year and stay on air.
[00:42:51.112 --> 00:42:54.054]  And we don't have the reserves to do that if they make some of these moves.
[00:42:54.094 --> 00:42:57.015]  So get the money to us now so we can operate.
[00:42:57.095 --> 00:42:58.476]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:42:58.676 --> 00:43:02.358]  You can also donate at InfoWarsTore.com in the Support Us section.
[00:43:04.392 --> 00:43:07.554]  The world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[00:43:07.714 --> 00:43:17.339]  That was two years ago that AOC and Beto O'Rourke told you that the world was ending in 12 years because of climate change.
[00:43:17.399 --> 00:43:18.780]  Well, what is climate change?
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:29.906]  It's the cover for them to carry out the shutdown of the world economy and a vertical integration, as they call it, a consolidation of all the money and the power and the resources.
[00:43:30.566 --> 00:43:36.394]  So they can control the planet to protect it from the overpopulation and then cause mass starvation.
[00:43:37.155 --> 00:43:39.278]  And so what she's saying, hey, the world won't be here.
[00:43:40.079 --> 00:43:41.121]  Humans won't be here in 12 years.
[00:43:42.873 --> 00:43:44.535]  She's being told that by higher-ups.
[00:43:45.055 --> 00:44:00.629]  She's believing them because they're going to institute global bioweapon releases and economic collapses and famines that will cause the depopulation that the UN and the Club of Rome and the United Nations have been calling for.
[00:44:00.910 --> 00:44:06.475]  That's why they're now bragging that COVID-19 is going to save the earth, it's going to depopulate things, it's going to lower the carbon footprint.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:11.962]  So the so-called guardians of the earth are the ones with the genetic engineering.
[00:44:11.982 --> 00:44:19.225]  They're the ones creating the cross-species chimera, animals and plants and insects and bacteria and viruses.
[00:44:19.265 --> 00:44:24.347]  They're the ones that say they're building a post-human world and a post-carbon world.
[00:44:24.827 --> 00:44:26.548]  So let's look at some of these headlines.
[00:44:27.028 --> 00:44:28.609]  Buy lots of food and store it.
[00:44:29.469 --> 00:44:33.372]  In safe places because very difficult times are approaching.
[00:44:33.993 --> 00:44:43.901]  And I've got the mass exodus out of blue cities and blue states and leftist areas around the world and COVID-19 causing food shortages and massive food cost spikes.
[00:44:44.461 --> 00:44:46.543]  Why is all this happening?
[00:44:47.083 --> 00:44:48.224]  The headlines are all the same.
[00:44:48.584 --> 00:44:50.306]  How COVID is affecting U.S.
[00:44:50.326 --> 00:44:50.946]  food supply.
[00:44:51.026 --> 00:44:51.186]  No.
[00:44:51.647 --> 00:44:52.407]  The lockdown.
[00:44:53.348 --> 00:44:55.610]  The hysteria is causing
[00:44:57.574 --> 00:44:58.354]  The lack of food.
[00:44:58.474 --> 00:45:00.415]  It's causing the breakdown in civilization.
[00:45:01.336 --> 00:45:11.121]  It's called the Great Reset by the Davos Group last year and this year, saying they would use a virus to cause an economic collapse.
[00:45:12.101 --> 00:45:13.062]  And they didn't think of this.
[00:45:13.222 --> 00:45:16.764]  The Rockefeller Foundation 10 years ago in lockstep came out and said it.
[00:45:16.804 --> 00:45:18.204]  And Bill Gates last year in Event 201.
[00:45:19.594 --> 00:45:24.242]  So I'm here to tell you, they're the ones causing the end of civilization for the general public.
[00:45:24.483 --> 00:45:26.105]  They're the ones causing the collapse.
[00:45:26.146 --> 00:45:28.069]  This is 21st century warfare.
[00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:29.491]  I'm going to tell you again.
[00:45:30.959 --> 00:45:33.161]  You need to warn everybody you know about who's behind this.
[00:45:33.221 --> 00:45:35.703]  You need to share these articles and videos and do your own research.
[00:45:36.403 --> 00:45:38.285]  And you need to personally get prepared.
[00:45:39.105 --> 00:45:48.412]  Once the food chain, the supply chain, really breaks down, which has already happened in the third world, the UN admits millions are starving to death a month, hundreds of millions are in danger.
[00:45:49.293 --> 00:45:58.240]  Once it breaks down in the third world and that food chain collapses, that supply chain, it will cause devastation and starvation here and separately.
[00:45:58.880 --> 00:46:00.160]  I would tell you, get prepared.
[00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:01.441]  Get high quality, storable food.
[00:46:01.801 --> 00:46:02.801]  Get water filtration.
[00:46:03.121 --> 00:46:06.402]  And we have those areas covered with the highest quality water filtration.
[00:46:06.743 --> 00:46:09.043]  Highest rated at very affordable low prices.
[00:46:09.303 --> 00:46:10.824]  With gravity fed portable filters.
[00:46:11.144 --> 00:46:13.485]  Ready for your house, RV, home, campsite.
[00:46:13.725 --> 00:46:17.546]  With the Alexa Pure and of course the Pro Pure systems that are both comparable.
[00:46:17.766 --> 00:46:20.547]  Made by other manufacturers that are excellent here in the United States.
[00:46:21.107 --> 00:46:27.912]  And then of course, we've got my patron supply that supplies us one to two week delivery of high quality, affordable food, special meals are available.
[00:46:28.192 --> 00:46:31.954]  But back when the COVID hysteria was going, we said, don't get the food for COVID.
[00:46:32.234 --> 00:46:35.216]  Get it for the supply chain breakdown and what's coming.
[00:46:35.497 --> 00:46:51.007]  So whether Trump wins or whether Trump loses the globalists have said they're going ahead with the collapse of civilization worldwide and the collapse of the third world and the replacement migration after they've dominated and exploited the third world against the first world.
[00:46:51.247 --> 00:47:02.718]  This is sophisticated, it's evil, it's ruthless, but if we face the facts and if we become prepared and self-sufficient, we can weather the storm and be leaders into the future to say no to this system.
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:11.446]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:20.104 --> 00:47:22.166]  Alright, let's jump right into it.
[00:47:22.206 --> 00:47:26.989]  I'm going to start getting into more of the news right now.
[00:47:29.291 --> 00:47:30.932]  But I just want to add one more thing here.
[00:47:32.273 --> 00:47:44.922]  When I put up this graphic for TV viewers and describe it for radio listeners, I'm not exaggerating that you've got the dam of the Republic and what's left of freedom of speech and the Second Amendment that's symbolized by Infowars as the tip of the spear.
[00:47:46.038 --> 00:47:49.881]  And you've got the destructive force of communism just waiting to crush you and your family.
[00:47:53.384 --> 00:48:10.116]  And so, when I get up here on air and I tell you that now is the time to tell everybody you know about this broadcast and ban.video and 2020ElectionsCenter.com, that URL has not been banned by the enemy platforms as of now.
[00:48:10.296 --> 00:48:11.437]  You can share the videos that way.
[00:48:12.218 --> 00:48:13.659]  That will change the course of history.
[00:48:15.435 --> 00:48:18.796]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[00:48:18.816 --> 00:48:19.976]  They're going to contest the election.
[00:48:20.236 --> 00:48:21.417]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[00:48:21.717 --> 00:48:25.058]  They're super pissed that I'm on air, first exposing the red mirage.
[00:48:26.258 --> 00:48:27.238]  And they're planning to contest.
[00:48:28.158 --> 00:48:28.719]  We did that.
[00:48:28.819 --> 00:48:29.319]  You did that.
[00:48:29.399 --> 00:48:30.359]  You kept us on air.
[00:48:30.779 --> 00:48:32.119]  We did the analysis first.
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:33.560]  It's now gone mainstream.
[00:48:33.580 --> 00:48:35.640]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:37.321]  And what they've said directly to us,
[00:48:38.340 --> 00:48:45.026]  Is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want and you need to stop right now.
[00:48:45.126 --> 00:48:46.207]  And they're very, very serious.
[00:48:47.107 --> 00:48:49.569]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:50.370]  This is not going to happen.
[00:48:50.410 --> 00:48:52.652]  So they are moving now to destroy me.
[00:48:53.392 --> 00:48:53.913]  It's okay.
[00:48:55.614 --> 00:48:57.396]  I need to hold on as long as possible.
[00:48:58.507 --> 00:49:02.230]  And so I'm telling you, go to InfoWorksStore.com, get your high quality, affordable food.
[00:49:02.330 --> 00:49:03.391]  It's drop shipped by my pantry.
[00:49:03.411 --> 00:49:04.272]  It's super high quality.
[00:49:04.652 --> 00:49:06.233]  One to two weeks before the big rush comes.
[00:49:06.834 --> 00:49:08.055]  And order the supplements.
[00:49:08.756 --> 00:49:16.622]  Because I gotta tell you, I have to make the decision in the next week on whether I'm gonna have everything go to full price because we can't get most of the supplements anymore.
[00:49:16.942 --> 00:49:19.124]  Because the supply chain's breaking down, not just for us, but everybody.
[00:49:19.545 --> 00:49:24.689]  And I won't get the crap that they've got out there and downgrade our products and, you know, reformulate them and make them weaker.
[00:49:25.964 --> 00:49:26.564]  That's how that works.
[00:49:26.584 --> 00:49:28.725]  You change the formula, you have to reformulate it.
[00:49:28.745 --> 00:49:30.385]  We're always reformulating because they get better.
[00:49:30.685 --> 00:49:34.386]  I'm not going to reformulate and sell you the type of crap from China and stuff.
[00:49:34.426 --> 00:49:35.986]  We don't sell any supplements from China.
[00:49:36.826 --> 00:49:38.306]  Most of our stuff's right here in North America.
[00:49:38.867 --> 00:49:40.547]  Some of it's from South America and places like that.
[00:49:41.527 --> 00:49:42.287]  Some of it's from Greece.
[00:49:42.407 --> 00:49:46.248]  But the point is, is that I'm telling you, stuff's breaking down.
[00:49:46.288 --> 00:49:47.068]  It's bad, okay?
[00:49:48.328 --> 00:49:49.349]  And it's not just that.
[00:49:49.409 --> 00:49:50.389]  It's all the other attacks.
[00:49:52.329 --> 00:49:53.310]  We're going to be in this together.
[00:49:53.710 --> 00:49:54.670]  I don't feel sorry for myself.
[00:49:55.031 --> 00:49:55.891]  I'm sorry for America.
[00:49:56.612 --> 00:50:03.576]  And when Trump gets back in, which they're probably not going to be able to stop him, because America's waking up, they're going to bring in the depression.
[00:50:03.636 --> 00:50:04.997]  I don't know how he's going to hold it off.
[00:50:05.797 --> 00:50:12.421]  That's why they've paid off all the right-wing pundits to say, oh, we're devaluing things, the dollar's dead, Trump shouldn't be doing stimulus.
[00:50:13.042 --> 00:50:15.243]  If we don't do the stimulus, we're going to totally collapse.
[00:50:15.263 --> 00:50:15.984]  That's their plan.
[00:50:16.304 --> 00:50:18.085]  Of course what he's doing long term will be bad.
[00:50:18.265 --> 00:50:19.726]  We don't have a choice anymore!
[00:50:21.152 --> 00:50:22.853]  Anybody that understands economics knows that.
[00:50:23.174 --> 00:50:28.297]  We need political power and control of our country because it's ideology that can build everything back.
[00:50:28.557 --> 00:50:33.281]  If we don't have the ideology of the Republic and America and freedom, it won't matter.
[00:50:33.961 --> 00:50:34.962]  They're making their move.
[00:50:35.002 --> 00:50:35.943]  I'm getting chills right now.
[00:50:36.443 --> 00:50:39.425]  Every channel, every show, the dollar's dead, America's over.
[00:50:39.765 --> 00:50:41.987]  You know, Wall Street now bearish on the dollar.
[00:50:42.547 --> 00:50:43.488]  On and on and on.
[00:50:43.508 --> 00:50:44.769]  They're making their move.
[00:50:47.017 --> 00:50:51.139]  And empires and republics fall very, very incrementally from rotting within.
[00:50:51.159 --> 00:50:54.061]  But then finally, like an old barn, when a tornado comes by, they blow over.
[00:50:54.722 --> 00:50:55.222]  They blow down.
[00:50:56.523 --> 00:50:58.804]  And they're huffing and they're puffing, trying to blow our barn down.
[00:50:59.144 --> 00:51:04.187]  And Trump's trying to put in some new logs, put in some new spikes, put in some new nails.
[00:51:04.647 --> 00:51:08.470]  He's trying to shore things up with sandbags, because the storm's here.
[00:51:09.502 --> 00:51:16.365]  And it's the global government New World Order storm to bring down the Republic and bring in the post-human era and lock everything down.
[00:51:17.125 --> 00:51:18.846]  And Trump's fighting the lockdown.
[00:51:20.006 --> 00:51:22.747]  Remember people that told you, oh, it's a secret thing Trump's doing?
[00:51:23.207 --> 00:51:24.748]  Well, he rounds up all the bad guys.
[00:51:24.808 --> 00:51:26.248]  Don't come out of your houses.
[00:51:26.909 --> 00:51:35.392]  While the left is told to boil out of their nest and go out and burn everything down and destabilize the country so they can run headlines that America's over and America sucks and Trump caused this.
[00:51:35.992 --> 00:51:38.073]  But the good news is, people see through it.
[00:51:39.261 --> 00:51:43.906]  And they see through who's behind the riots and who's behind the COVID hoax, exaggeration.
[00:51:45.228 --> 00:51:47.250]  And so we're turning the corner.
[00:51:47.290 --> 00:51:54.798]  But I'm telling you, the enemy, if you look at their minions like Pelosi and others, are not going to give up.
[00:51:55.719 --> 00:51:58.202]  And they are going to push harder than they ever had.
[00:51:59.181 --> 00:52:07.386]  So everything InfoWars has done for 26 years, everything you've done in your life of being informed and being involved is building towards this point, and this isn't a normal time.
[00:52:07.606 --> 00:52:08.467]  And I know you know that.
[00:52:09.127 --> 00:52:10.308]  And I salute you and I thank you.
[00:52:11.369 --> 00:52:16.692]  But when you call in thanking me for trying to self-preserve myself and you, we're in the same boat, brother.
[00:52:16.712 --> 00:52:18.573]  So I get it.
[00:52:18.673 --> 00:52:22.116]  I appreciate you just as much as you appreciate me, but I'm telling you, now is the time
[00:52:23.134 --> 00:52:37.108]  Because I need to know, I gotta decide the next week, with what we've got in our coffers, with only enough to operate, if I sold both my houses, okay, which I don't even care about, I've got the mortgage to pay for this place, it would not operate us for a month and a half.
[00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:40.031]  I don't, I'm not rich, I don't have all this money the media says I have, okay?
[00:52:40.972 --> 00:52:46.378]  Got a nice truck, a nice car, stuff like that, I got insurance for my kids, I'm doing well, I don't care, I don't need more, I'm happy.
[00:52:47.892 --> 00:52:48.893]  I don't need the house on the hill.
[00:52:49.673 --> 00:52:58.278]  But what I'm saying is, is that I don't have the gasoline to go into the future with the things they're pulling and the things they're doing unless I get a big chunk of money in.
[00:52:58.318 --> 00:52:59.159]  So here's what I need you to do.
[00:52:59.179 --> 00:53:06.864]  I need you to go to Infowars.com to the live show feed today that says Emergency Broadcast.
[00:53:08.063 --> 00:53:11.686]  Globalist planning, massive world depression if Trump wins or loses.
[00:53:12.146 --> 00:53:22.795]  And if you scroll down in that, there's a link to Infowarsstore.com and the donate page where you can sign up for recurring donations or you can sign up for one-time donations.
[00:53:26.428 --> 00:53:30.831]  And if folks would simply go there and make a major donation.
[00:53:31.172 --> 00:53:31.972]  There's also a P.O.
[00:53:32.012 --> 00:53:32.593]  Box on there.
[00:53:32.693 --> 00:53:34.094]  I know people have got money out there.
[00:53:34.334 --> 00:53:37.036]  It's always sad how it's the poor people that do most of the donating.
[00:53:37.056 --> 00:53:39.178]  Because I run into them on the street and they're great people.
[00:53:39.218 --> 00:53:39.698]  That's great.
[00:53:39.978 --> 00:53:42.761]  But the middle class and the rich people hold on to it.
[00:53:43.081 --> 00:53:46.564]  They could turn, you know, a piece of coal into a diamond in their rear end.
[00:53:46.944 --> 00:53:53.329]  And you're going to lose it all because Soros and the enemy spend their money to dominate you and you won't spend money to fight them.
[00:53:54.841 --> 00:53:57.102]  I will give both my arms right now to defeat them.
[00:53:57.462 --> 00:53:58.363]  I'd give my life to.
[00:53:58.863 --> 00:54:00.084]  I don't give a rat's ass about money.
[00:54:00.124 --> 00:54:00.884]  Money's energy.
[00:54:01.204 --> 00:54:01.985]  Money's a weapon.
[00:54:02.665 --> 00:54:06.487]  Money's a bullet I fire out of the barrel of a gun at the enemy politically.
[00:54:07.828 --> 00:54:08.769]  And the information war.
[00:54:09.489 --> 00:54:11.890]  I'm just telling you folks, this is serious.
[00:54:13.171 --> 00:54:16.152]  And the country needs to be prayed for and you need to pray for yourself.
[00:54:16.553 --> 00:54:17.913]  And I'm telling you, we make it easy.
[00:54:17.953 --> 00:54:19.374]  We've got things that make your life better.
[00:54:20.075 --> 00:54:21.515]  We've got things that are essential you need.
[00:54:22.216 --> 00:54:22.576]  And we've
[00:54:24.039 --> 00:54:25.300]  Got the information warfare.
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:28.441]  And I'll ask you, support our local radio stations.
[00:54:28.962 --> 00:54:29.802]  Spread the word about them.
[00:54:29.962 --> 00:54:30.823]  Become a sponsor.
[00:54:30.883 --> 00:54:31.223]  Thank them.
[00:54:31.483 --> 00:54:32.904]  Tithe the local radio station.
[00:54:33.144 --> 00:54:41.889]  This show, and I'm not saying we're good, does more for pro-life, more against the Satanists, more to bring people to Christ than the little fake country club churches all day that people give all their money to.
[00:54:42.769 --> 00:54:44.630]  Donate to your local radio station.
[00:54:44.650 --> 00:54:45.050]  Send them $100 a month.
[00:54:46.833 --> 00:54:48.033]  $10 a month, whatever you've got.
[00:54:48.274 --> 00:54:49.234]  Give them your word of mouth.
[00:54:49.314 --> 00:54:51.234]  Go and eat at the restaurant that sponsors them.
[00:54:51.575 --> 00:54:52.515]  You've got the power.
[00:54:52.635 --> 00:54:52.855]  Use it.
[00:54:52.995 --> 00:54:57.216]  The left's trying to bully us, dominate us, destroy us, and I don't want them to win.
[00:54:57.236 --> 00:54:59.777]  Because they're pulling out the stops.
[00:54:59.797 --> 00:55:01.097]  They've committed crimes that are insane.
[00:55:02.458 --> 00:55:03.538]  It's all coming up next hour.
[00:55:03.558 --> 00:55:05.399]  We have a special guest from Australia.
[00:55:05.419 --> 00:55:08.140]  Donald Rain is going to be coming in as well.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:15.542]  But if you go to InfoWareStore.com, you see the Support Us link over on the right-hand side.
[00:55:17.039 --> 00:55:20.863]  And if you click on that, you'll find the different websites and the donation page.
[00:55:21.083 --> 00:55:22.064]  They're there to support us.
[00:55:22.824 --> 00:55:24.386]  Right there, click on that on the right-hand side.
[00:55:25.026 --> 00:55:27.789]  But, I mean, you need a four-stage ion filter.
[00:55:27.969 --> 00:55:30.492]  We have the best at the lowest price, because that's what I do!
[00:55:31.653 --> 00:55:35.776]  We have the best tolerable food, highest quality you're going to get, unless you pay five times more.
[00:55:36.710 --> 00:55:37.751]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:55:38.512 --> 00:55:39.192]  The best prices.
[00:55:39.252 --> 00:55:40.093]  It's all there.
[00:55:40.513 --> 00:55:42.895]  But we've only got the ability to do business now.
[00:55:43.696 --> 00:55:45.057]  We're not going to have it much longer.
[00:55:45.838 --> 00:55:46.898]  If the enemy has their way.
[00:55:47.018 --> 00:55:48.580]  I'm telling you.
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:50.481]  I used to say support InfoWars.
[00:55:50.922 --> 00:55:51.862]  Rescue InfoWars.
[00:55:51.923 --> 00:55:52.563]  Save yourself.
[00:55:52.923 --> 00:55:53.564]  Save the world.
[00:55:53.864 --> 00:55:54.745]  We're in this together.
[00:55:55.045 --> 00:55:56.146]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:55:56.482 --> 00:56:02.823]  Communism's up here, Infowars is the damn blocking it, which is all of us together supporting, and you and I are all down here with our families.
[00:56:03.043 --> 00:56:04.584]  My children are right here!
[00:56:05.304 --> 00:56:10.845]  With pedophiles and devil worshippers and forced inoculations and FEMA camps coming for us, and war!
[00:56:10.865 --> 00:56:13.786]  If we don't fix this now, we're gonna have to fight.
[00:56:15.826 --> 00:56:19.487]  And you know, I really need to repent, because the sick part of me just hopes it goes down.
[00:56:24.192 --> 00:56:34.299]  Because all you devil worshippers and trash that have been pushing and pushing and pushing forever, you better hope you fail in your operation and you don't push us into the fire.
[00:56:34.319 --> 00:56:39.302]  Because I swear on the altar of God, you will pay.
[00:56:40.743 --> 00:56:47.268]  And quite frankly, I'm so alive right now, I'm so glad Soros and Bill Gates hate me.
[00:56:47.328 --> 00:56:50.310]  That's the greatest honor in my life!
[00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:53.332]  It's the greatest thing in my life next to my children.
[00:56:54.292 --> 00:56:58.854]  That I'm real, I'm all in, and you know me by my enemies, and I know our audience of activists.
[00:56:59.414 --> 00:57:04.396]  It's you they hate because they don't have your will, they don't have your soul, they don't have your heart.
[00:57:04.636 --> 00:57:06.136]  They don't control your destiny!
[00:57:06.676 --> 00:57:08.397]  They sure as hell don't control mine!
[00:57:09.616 --> 00:57:19.186]  So we're trying to hold the dam against the Satanists and the armies of hell, and we pray to Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father to lead God and direct us against this enemy!
[00:57:19.806 --> 00:57:21.528]  But I need money to fight a war!
[00:57:21.748 --> 00:57:22.749]  And I need word of mouth!
[00:57:23.009 --> 00:57:23.870]  And I need prayer!
[00:57:24.051 --> 00:57:24.991]  And I need action!
[00:57:25.412 --> 00:57:26.953]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[00:57:27.796 --> 00:57:29.317]  That dam's already got holes in it!
[00:57:29.817 --> 00:57:33.818]  And the enemy's telling you, don't stick your fingers in it, don't block it, everything's fine.
[00:57:33.998 --> 00:57:36.079]  Peaches and cream are on the other side.
[00:57:36.299 --> 00:57:36.859]  No!
[00:57:37.359 --> 00:57:39.160]  You know it's not peaches and cream!
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.341]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[00:57:42.141 --> 00:57:43.021]  One way or another!
[00:57:44.122 --> 00:57:49.323]  Only question is, do we have a president in the middle of a fight against the new world order, or is it going to be us that does it?
[00:57:49.923 --> 00:57:51.164]  But we know we're not giving up!
[00:57:52.932 --> 00:57:58.278]  I'm Owen Schroer host of the Info Wars War Room every day from 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:57:58.478 --> 00:58:09.331]  and that means I have to follow up after the big man and that is not an easy task so I need to be as focused and energized as possible every day at 3 o'clock so yes I
[00:58:09.571 --> 00:58:12.233]  I am on performance enhancing drugs.
[00:58:12.693 --> 00:58:35.207]  It's the combination of the energy of the turbo force, the focus of the brain force, and then the VasoBeat Complete, which is a beet supplement, which act as a vasodilator, which makes sure that the nutrients and supplements that you're intaking are getting all throughout the body so that I can maintain proper focus and energy for three hours and beyond.
[00:58:35.407 --> 00:58:36.668]  It's almost three o'clock.
[00:58:36.868 --> 00:58:43.333]  That means it's time to take my performance enhancers that I have conveniently stashed right here at my desk.
[00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:47.296]  I literally will never host a war room without them.
[00:58:47.476 --> 00:58:51.039]  It starts with the Turbo Force right here.
[00:58:51.219 --> 00:58:54.601]  Just get your cup of water, pour in the Turbo Force.
[00:58:54.841 --> 00:58:57.463]  I then take my Vezo B Complete right here.
[00:58:58.304 --> 00:59:00.546]  One dropper, two droppers.
[00:59:01.266 --> 00:59:03.368]  Stir it up just a little bit for good measure.
[00:59:04.983 --> 00:59:19.215]  And then, with the energy from the TurboForce and the nitrates in the VesoBeat Complete, with the Focus from BrainForce, with the Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, and all the other supplements that are inside of that.
[00:59:21.697 --> 00:59:22.877]  Those are the supplements I take.
[00:59:23.951 --> 00:59:30.396]  Every day, right before I go on air, for maximum performance, maximum focus, maximum energy.
[00:59:30.816 --> 00:59:43.645]  And the good news is, once I finish drinking this Turbo Force, I've got energy for about 10 hours, so I can continue working, pass the show, work on other things, go and lift weights, run, whatever I need or want to do.
[00:59:43.845 --> 00:59:51.851]  It's all with the Turbo Force, the Brain Force, and the Vezo Beat Complete Trifecta, available only at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:00:12.944 --> 01:00:14.425]  All right, Alex Jones here, back live.
[01:00:14.485 --> 01:00:22.788]  Carlos Zapata, who spoke a few weeks ago at a California City Council and got a lot of great attention.
[01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:23.988]  What he said was all dead on.
[01:00:24.008 --> 01:00:25.409]  He said better than I could say it.
[01:00:25.849 --> 01:00:27.369]  He'll be joining us coming up.
[01:00:27.950 --> 01:00:34.472]  I just spent two hours on Australia because the UN is in control of national policy of every country but a few.
[01:00:34.532 --> 01:00:36.773]  The US was under their policy.
[01:00:38.533 --> 01:00:40.454]  At the WHO and at UNESCO.
[01:00:40.534 --> 01:00:41.534]  Trump's pulled out of both.
[01:00:42.134 --> 01:00:46.356]  Pulled out of UNESCO three years ago.
[01:00:47.976 --> 01:00:51.437]  Because when you sign onto that treaty, the UN is in control of your immigration policy.
[01:00:51.937 --> 01:00:56.839]  It was bringing us refugees that were 80 plus percent Islamic age, military men.
[01:00:58.311 --> 01:00:59.892]  And so Trump pulled us out of that.
[01:01:00.433 --> 01:01:02.694]  And then a few months ago, as you know, he pulled us out of the W.H.O.
[01:01:03.115 --> 01:01:04.516]  This is the real deal, folks.
[01:01:05.036 --> 01:01:07.138]  And then the W.H.O.
[01:01:07.178 --> 01:01:13.102]  has come out and criticized us owning guns and said we're racist and our police are bad.
[01:01:13.922 --> 01:01:16.282]  When there are some bad cops, good, fry them when they're bad.
[01:01:16.723 --> 01:01:24.704]  But, I mean, statistically, if you're a black man getting shot by cops is, like, about 14 black men are killed wrongly a year by cops, even with mainline numbers.
[01:01:24.764 --> 01:01:29.845]  I mean, but every time it happens, it's like, burn all these cities and try to destabilize the country.
[01:01:30.685 --> 01:01:33.746]  As Kanye West came out and said, 22-plus million black people have been killed.
[01:01:35.326 --> 01:01:36.126]  That clip's coming up.
[01:01:36.966 --> 01:01:37.847]  In fact, let's just do this.
[01:01:38.067 --> 01:01:39.007]  Let's air the Clintons.
[01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:43.332]  Came out again, now with Bill, and said contest the election no matter what.
[01:01:43.352 --> 01:01:48.216]  Even though they admit Trump's going to win in the poll numbers, they're still going to contest it with their mail-in ballots.
[01:01:48.596 --> 01:01:50.038]  And then play the clip of Kanye.
[01:01:50.938 --> 01:01:54.441]  He came out and said, Black Lives Matter is fake.
[01:01:55.162 --> 01:01:57.184]  If you cared about black lives, you'd care about abortion.
[01:01:57.644 --> 01:02:00.747]  Passed by Margaret Sanger to kill black people on record.
[01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:01.828]  So here's both those clips.
[01:02:03.730 --> 01:02:20.495]  And I said, my advice to Joe Biden, and I've told the campaign this, obviously, is do not concede under any circumstances because I believe the other side is going to cheat and sneak and try to do everything they can.
[01:02:20.555 --> 01:02:23.255]  He's not going to leave if he loses.
[01:02:24.636 --> 01:02:29.137]  So we're going to be resolved and we're going to be strong and we're going to be
[01:02:29.617 --> 01:02:30.979]  You know, on that front line.
[01:02:31.319 --> 01:02:33.341]  And, uh, we're gonna get our country back.
[01:02:33.401 --> 01:02:34.142]  That's our plan.
[01:02:49.181 --> 01:02:51.743]  Have horrible policies where the military has record suicides.
[01:02:52.323 --> 01:02:52.803]  All of this.
[01:02:52.863 --> 01:02:53.724]  Promote pedophilia.
[01:02:53.744 --> 01:02:55.445]  And she's like, we're going to get our country back.
[01:02:55.865 --> 01:02:57.906]  Smiling like a little goblin demon.
[01:02:58.246 --> 01:03:00.728]  With Bill the pervert pedophile in the background.
[01:03:00.768 --> 01:03:01.148]  Here it is.
[01:03:01.328 --> 01:03:01.828]  Here's Kanye.
[01:03:05.250 --> 01:03:06.811]  To the award show because it was a setup.
[01:03:07.012 --> 01:03:07.272]  Right.
[01:03:07.352 --> 01:03:10.033]  Now, okay, so let us get to, let's get to life.
[01:03:12.799 --> 01:03:26.623]  In 50 years, there's been over 22,500,000 black people aborted, strategically and on purpose.
[01:03:27.883 --> 01:03:34.865]  Planned Parenthood was set up and placed in minority communities to
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:37.300]  Kill black people.
[01:03:37.761 --> 01:03:51.145]  You're talking about when Margaret Sanger, the originator of Planned Parenthood at the time, because a lot of people, when you say things like that, in their defense, they say, well, Planned Parenthood today is a different organization.
[01:03:51.205 --> 01:03:58.308]  But what you cannot deny is these facts that Ye is about to give you right now.
[01:03:58.928 --> 01:03:59.368]  Here we go.
[01:03:59.588 --> 01:04:08.450]  Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, was an avowed racist whose goal was to reduce the black population in America, and she succeeded.
[01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:13.991]  80% of abortion clinics in America are in minority neighborhoods.
[01:04:14.451 --> 01:04:16.631]  Over 22,500,000 black babies have been aborted in 50 years.
[01:04:16.731 --> 01:04:18.632]  Over 1,000 black babies are aborted every day.
[01:04:27.918 --> 01:04:30.999]  So that means we are inside of it as we speak.
[01:04:31.059 --> 01:04:32.039]  This is genocide.
[01:04:32.079 --> 01:04:34.880]  So wait, we are inside of genocide as we speak.
[01:04:34.900 --> 01:04:48.163]  So what about the people that are going to argue and say, but... Alright, last segment of this hour, I'm going to play more of this, but imagine 14 black dudes killed wrongly by the cops, maybe each year, versus hundreds of thousands, millions killed each year.
[01:04:49.031 --> 01:04:52.095]  Again, it's the genocide group running the black leadership.
[01:04:52.135 --> 01:04:59.724]  That's what Margaret Singer went and did, is they hired the black leadership and created the NAACP and all of it to exterminate black people.
[01:05:04.129 --> 01:05:04.950]  You see this ad?
[01:05:05.551 --> 01:05:09.095]  I wrote it about a week ago, and I believe every single word in it.
[01:05:10.273 --> 01:05:18.685]  The safest bet you can make in the world right now is getting high quality, storable food at a low price because the future is so uncertain.
[01:05:19.326 --> 01:05:26.115]  The entire New World Order operation is about making you dependent and making you domesticated where you're not self-sufficient.
[01:05:26.656 --> 01:05:30.519]  The number one thing you need is a relationship with God and self-defense.
[01:05:31.299 --> 01:05:33.841]  After that comes food and water.
[01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:42.186]  We've got the best storable food and the best water filters in-house and portable at InfoWarsTore.com and we have the storable food in stock.
[01:05:42.387 --> 01:05:45.989]  All the other big competitors have sold out or have like 10 week waiting periods.
[01:05:46.249 --> 01:05:46.629]  We don't.
[01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.771]  One to two weeks to ship to you.
[01:05:48.971 --> 01:05:49.771]  We have the food.
[01:05:50.012 --> 01:05:51.052]  We've got to get it packaged.
[01:05:51.292 --> 01:05:54.855]  It's the biggest company in the world because they've got the name because they're trusted.
[01:05:55.275 --> 01:05:56.556]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:05:56.696 --> 01:06:00.701]  Get prepared now before the globalists go completely crazy.
[01:06:00.781 --> 01:06:01.521]  Get ready now!
[01:06:06.144 --> 01:06:12.606]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:06:34.318 --> 01:07:01.713]  Speaking at a city council about a week and a half ago, Carlos Zapata, a business owner, a father, a veteran of the Iraq War, laid out what was really happening, and I think did a 100% dead-on job, better than I could have done in two minutes, in Citizens Communications, to challenge their arrogance, to lay out the facts, and let them know the reality, that even a minority of us are highly motivated and stand up, they cannot stop us.
[01:07:02.073 --> 01:07:02.974]  Here's what he had to say.
[01:07:05.938 --> 01:07:12.542]  I'm telling you guys, you know, I'm pretty appalled at what's going on.
[01:07:12.662 --> 01:07:19.866]  You know, at first we sat as concerned citizens that we all want to figure out how to best navigate our way through this whole COVID thing, you know, and
[01:07:21.206 --> 01:07:24.107]  As we realize that, it's not quite as dangerous as we thought it'd be.
[01:07:24.127 --> 01:07:25.767]  I was absolutely appalled at the cowardice.
[01:07:25.827 --> 01:07:32.049]  And as you're sitting there with your masks on, I don't blame you for wearing masks because I'd be hiding my face too if I was you for what you're doing.
[01:07:32.329 --> 01:07:33.929]  It's absolutely horrendous what you're doing to these people.
[01:07:33.969 --> 01:07:34.689]  I'm a business owner.
[01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:37.770]  And I'm telling you, our families are starving.
[01:07:38.390 --> 01:07:39.410]  You guys can sit here with your jobs.
[01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:40.530]  You can sit here and you're going to get paid.
[01:07:40.550 --> 01:07:43.431]  You can fall asleep in your chair like that gentleman's doing behind his mask right there.
[01:07:44.991 --> 01:07:47.432]  And I'm telling you right now, that right now we're being peaceful.
[01:07:48.292 --> 01:07:51.413]  And you better be happy that we're good citizens, that we're peaceful citizens.
[01:07:51.713 --> 01:07:53.074]  But it's not going to be peaceful much longer.
[01:07:53.094 --> 01:07:53.834]  Okay?
[01:07:54.094 --> 01:07:54.834]  And this isn't a threat.
[01:07:54.874 --> 01:07:55.415]  I'm not a criminal.
[01:07:55.435 --> 01:07:56.255]  I've never been a criminal.
[01:07:56.635 --> 01:08:01.637]  I'm telling you, good citizens are going to turn into real concerned and revolutionary citizens real soon.
[01:08:02.217 --> 01:08:03.458]  And nobody else is going to say that.
[01:08:03.738 --> 01:08:06.399]  I'm probably the only person that has a ball to say what I'm saying right now.
[01:08:07.379 --> 01:08:12.041]  That we're building, we're organizing, and we'll work with law enforcement or without law enforcement.
[01:08:12.481 --> 01:08:15.702]  But you won't stop us when time comes because our families are starving.
[01:08:17.219 --> 01:08:21.522]  If you don't hear the seriousness of my voice, I hope you open your ears and you absolutely listen to what I'm saying.
[01:08:21.762 --> 01:08:24.084]  Because this is a warning for what's coming.
[01:08:24.604 --> 01:08:25.865]  It's not going to be peaceful much longer.
[01:08:26.045 --> 01:08:26.685]  It's not going to be rah-rahs.
[01:08:26.705 --> 01:08:27.686]  It's not going to be speeches.
[01:08:27.726 --> 01:08:30.087]  It's not going to be gathering outside saying the Pledge of Allegiance.
[01:08:30.288 --> 01:08:31.388]  It's not going to be waving flags.
[01:08:31.889 --> 01:08:32.549]  It's going to be real.
[01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:36.572]  When you've seen the things that I've seen, I went to war for this country.
[01:08:37.072 --> 01:08:39.614]  I've seen the ugliest, dirtiest part of humanity.
[01:08:40.578 --> 01:08:41.439]  I've been in combat.
[01:08:41.899 --> 01:08:43.301]  And I never want to go back again.
[01:08:43.481 --> 01:08:45.463]  But I'm telling you what, I will to save this country.
[01:08:46.164 --> 01:08:48.286]  If it has to be against our own citizens, it will happen.
[01:08:49.127 --> 01:08:50.529]  And there's a million people like me.
[01:08:50.849 --> 01:08:51.650]  And you won't stop us.
[01:08:52.851 --> 01:08:53.552]  Open the county.
[01:08:54.373 --> 01:08:55.855]  Let our citizens do what they need to do.
[01:08:57.236 --> 01:09:00.039]  Let owners of businesses do what they need to do to feed their families.
[01:09:01.155 --> 01:09:02.176]  Take the masks off!
[01:09:02.796 --> 01:09:04.437]  Quit masking and muzzling your children!
[01:09:05.117 --> 01:09:07.439]  The psychological damage you're doing to them is horrible.
[01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:10.401]  I've had six friends kill themselves since it's happened.
[01:09:10.821 --> 01:09:11.922]  Veterans who lost their jobs.
[01:09:12.562 --> 01:09:14.803]  How do you feel about being complicit in perpetuating that?
[01:09:15.123 --> 01:09:18.806]  The greatest hoax ever perpetuated on the American people, and you're a part of it by wearing your masks.
[01:09:19.066 --> 01:09:21.607]  In Shasta County, we're supposed to be red country up here.
[01:09:22.708 --> 01:09:24.129]  Not blue country, we're red country up here.
[01:09:24.309 --> 01:09:24.909]  You guys know that.
[01:09:24.929 --> 01:09:28.512]  I don't know, you claim to be conservatives, maybe you're not, maybe you're liberals, I don't know.
[01:09:29.414 --> 01:09:30.536]  But by God, we're Americans.
[01:09:30.716 --> 01:09:31.297]  And remember that.
[01:09:31.858 --> 01:09:32.559]  Take your masks off.
[01:09:32.579 --> 01:09:33.381]  Quit muzzling yourselves.
[01:09:33.721 --> 01:09:34.242]  Join us.
[01:09:34.382 --> 01:09:34.963]  Fight with us.
[01:09:35.925 --> 01:09:37.126]  Against what's going on in Sacramento.
[01:09:40.068 --> 01:09:41.650]  Carlos Zapata joins us.
[01:09:42.330 --> 01:09:50.657]  Recent video went viral in which Carlos Zapata tongue-lashed the Shasta County Board of Supervisors in Redding, California for invasive mask and lockdown policies.
[01:09:50.677 --> 01:09:53.119]  Similar to what we've seen in Australia related to COVID-19.
[01:09:53.659 --> 01:09:58.363]  He's a former Marine, husband, father of four, Iraq veteran, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu black belt, and teacher.
[01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:05.089]  He is a resident of Palo Credo, California, and a patriot, the owner of the Palomino Room in Red Bluff, California.
[01:10:05.529 --> 01:10:06.269]  And he joins us.
[01:10:06.749 --> 01:10:08.310]  So, Carlos, we really appreciate you.
[01:10:08.330 --> 01:10:08.970]  We love what you said.
[01:10:09.010 --> 01:10:09.830]  It's totally true.
[01:10:10.930 --> 01:10:11.590]  You've got the floor.
[01:10:11.610 --> 01:10:17.691]  I could ask a hundred questions of why you went and spoke, what happened since, what's happening with the exodus from California, where you see this going.
[01:10:17.951 --> 01:10:19.592]  But just, you've got the floor, my friend.
[01:10:19.932 --> 01:10:20.432]  Let us have it.
[01:10:21.612 --> 01:10:22.212]  Thanks for having me.
[01:10:22.232 --> 01:10:23.012]  Thanks for what you're doing.
[01:10:23.112 --> 01:10:24.773]  You know, you're really getting a lot of good word out there.
[01:10:25.253 --> 01:10:31.134]  And you're saying things that are resonating with a lot of people, where maybe a year ago, people would have thought folks like us are crazy.
[01:10:31.174 --> 01:10:31.894]  Now they're listening.
[01:10:32.623 --> 01:10:36.386]  And they're they're tuning into our platforms because we're seeing exactly what they're thinking.
[01:10:37.067 --> 01:10:58.764]  And yeah, so obviously started a couple weeks ago and I never had any plans to speak or to be so vocal about things that I was thinking, you know, I've been vocal in small circles, you know, within my group of friends within my small scope of influence, but never would I have dreamed that this was going to go this far on this big but that day that night I sort of got thrown
[01:10:59.224 --> 01:11:04.307]  And by a friend of mine who's been a great organizer, Alyssa McKeown, has been an awesome organizer here in our community.
[01:11:04.347 --> 01:11:16.755]  And she threw me to the front of the line at the Board of Supervisors meeting, and I figured I had two minutes to give them everything that I had and to put as much information as I could possibly put in front of them, you know, and then put the ball in their court.
[01:11:17.276 --> 01:11:19.337]  Because they've absolutely dropped the ball, you know.
[01:11:19.357 --> 01:11:22.599]  And what happens here, like most counties across the country,
[01:11:23.627 --> 01:11:24.008]  Is that
[01:11:42.766 --> 01:11:49.957]  The counties aren't getting that money, but we're to the point now where we want the county supervisors to understand that the money doesn't come from the government.
[01:11:49.977 --> 01:11:51.239]  It comes from us as citizens.
[01:11:51.259 --> 01:11:52.561]  It comes from business owners.
[01:11:52.602 --> 01:11:54.064]  It comes from people being able to do commerce.
[01:11:54.482 --> 01:11:57.263]  Here locally and outside of the area.
[01:11:58.163 --> 01:11:59.384]  And that's where we're at.
[01:11:59.544 --> 01:12:00.704]  So you guys saw what I said.
[01:12:00.744 --> 01:12:04.026]  I think the only incorrect thing I said was that there's a million people like me.
[01:12:04.066 --> 01:12:08.087]  I think there's more like probably 30 million people like me who would fight.
[01:12:08.948 --> 01:12:11.609]  I think there's probably 30 million ready to fight now.
[01:12:11.649 --> 01:12:13.950]  And as soon as we did that, we'd have 100 million behind us.
[01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:19.872]  Victory's there, as long as they don't distract us off if things get physical into some side fight.
[01:12:19.912 --> 01:12:21.152]  But I don't see that happening.
[01:12:21.512 --> 01:12:23.633]  I just see them taking our kindness as weakness.
[01:12:23.893 --> 01:12:25.514]  Where do you think this is all going gut level?
[01:12:25.554 --> 01:12:26.994]  You seem to have your head screwed on.
[01:12:28.355 --> 01:12:29.215]  I'll tell you what, Alex.
[01:12:30.095 --> 01:12:31.476]  Nobody wants war.
[01:12:31.916 --> 01:12:34.317]  You know, especially those of us who have been there don't want to repeat that.
[01:12:34.857 --> 01:12:36.578]  But I don't see any way out.
[01:12:36.598 --> 01:12:42.260]  The one thing I know about the socialist programs that they want to instill, they want to turn us into a socialist communist country.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:43.380]  Let's make no mistake about it.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:45.821]  And you can't vote your way out of socialism.
[01:12:45.841 --> 01:12:49.523]  And this is what they've wanted to feed down our throats forever, right?
[01:12:49.543 --> 01:12:59.729]  Well, if you don't like what's going on, you wait two or four years and then you vote that person out, you know, and you get newly elected officials that hopefully, you know, resonate with what you want them to do.
[01:12:59.829 --> 01:13:03.131]  But that's not the way that socialism works.
[01:13:03.291 --> 01:13:11.216]  Once it takes root into any country, I know this because my parents came from Peru and my family came from Chile and they came from these countries that were ravaged by socialism.
[01:13:11.841 --> 01:13:14.442]  Had they been able to vote their way out, maybe they would have stayed and changed their country.
[01:13:14.482 --> 01:13:20.504]  But the only way that you get out of a socialist state or a communist state is you either have to leave it or you have to fight.
[01:13:21.264 --> 01:13:22.545]  And there's nowhere else for us to go.
[01:13:22.765 --> 01:13:26.986]  My dad said to me a couple days ago, he said, son, we came here because it's the last pillar of freedom.
[01:13:27.006 --> 01:13:27.866]  Where are we going to go from here?
[01:13:27.946 --> 01:13:32.148]  We have no other country that we can pack up our stuff and our families and move to to start a new life.
[01:13:32.188 --> 01:13:32.688]  And this is it.
[01:13:33.008 --> 01:13:41.251]  My gut feeling, Alex, is that we're at that boiling point where there's a lot of angry people like myself that have been criminalized for doing the most fundamental thing, which is
[01:13:41.935 --> 01:13:44.497]  Open our businesses and earn a living for our families.
[01:13:45.298 --> 01:13:51.924]  And the only way that I see out of this is to fight if they fail to listen to our words.
[01:13:51.944 --> 01:13:54.927]  Because they've completely, completely failed to listen to our words at this point.
[01:13:55.747 --> 01:14:00.071]  You know, the mandates just get more strict and more regulations come down the pipeline.
[01:14:00.512 --> 01:14:02.393]  And it's almost like they feed you a little bit of a carrot, right?
[01:14:02.413 --> 01:14:04.255]  Every couple weeks, the governor gets on.
[01:14:04.275 --> 01:14:06.116]  He says, hey, we're getting closer to opening again.
[01:14:06.157 --> 01:14:07.638]  And then boom, they take it right back from you.
[01:14:08.138 --> 01:14:09.940]  And if you ask me personally, I think it's an experiment.
[01:14:09.960 --> 01:14:10.501]  It's a game.
[01:14:10.761 --> 01:14:16.387]  Oh, they admit it's a giant experiment, and all they do is tighten, tighten, tighten, tighten, tighten into their cult.
[01:14:16.447 --> 01:14:19.190]  And Bill Gates admits it's a post-industrial world.
[01:14:19.290 --> 01:14:30.161]  It's total economic control, so they can dictate to us, as you said, in Latin America and anywhere, rich, powerful countries, till they go communist or socialist, because they do it on purpose to make people poor to dictate to them.
[01:14:31.235 --> 01:14:31.655]  Absolutely.
[01:14:31.976 --> 01:14:34.617]  This has nothing to do with equitable wealth.
[01:14:34.637 --> 01:14:40.981]  It has nothing to do with creating a sense of equality, you know, for everybody as socialism sells itself.
[01:14:41.641 --> 01:14:43.362]  And you've got a lot on your head, Alex.
[01:14:43.382 --> 01:14:45.804]  You know, they're not even trying to hide or disguise this anymore.
[01:14:46.124 --> 01:14:52.808]  You know, even Castro himself in Cuba tried to disguise what he was selling from a centrist point of view, right?
[01:14:52.848 --> 01:14:57.191]  He told people that this was going to be good for everybody and he made promises, you know.
[01:14:57.211 --> 01:14:58.512]  Well, he was a secret communist.
[01:14:58.532 --> 01:14:59.172]  You know your history.
[01:14:59.372 --> 01:15:00.573]  He was a secret communist.
[01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:02.151]  A hundred percent.
[01:15:02.331 --> 01:15:04.032]  And these guys now, they're not even secret anymore.
[01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:12.961]  You know, here we are in the United States of America, 2020, and it's no secret what they want to do, where they used words like progressive and liberal before.
[01:15:13.021 --> 01:15:18.367]  Now they're just many other straight socialists, and we all know that communism is the next step to socialism.
[01:15:18.387 --> 01:15:20.709]  Carlos Zapata, you're on, you're exploding, you're on fire.
[01:15:21.029 --> 01:15:22.711]  When we come back, what do you want to cover next?
[01:15:22.791 --> 01:15:24.373]  I got a lot of questions, but what do you want to get to next?
[01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:26.137]  You know what, Alex?
[01:15:26.157 --> 01:15:29.139]  Let's just talk about where our country's going and how we got here.
[01:15:29.179 --> 01:15:32.361]  I think we need to understand how we got here in order to understand where we're going.
[01:15:32.401 --> 01:15:32.921]  Exactly.
[01:15:32.961 --> 01:15:36.524]  Know how we got here, to know where we are, know where we're going to go and make that decision.
[01:15:36.984 --> 01:15:39.566]  Everybody needs to know, no more procrastination now, folks.
[01:15:39.626 --> 01:15:41.227]  We're in the jaws of the fight.
[01:15:41.627 --> 01:15:42.828]  And if we fight back, we're going to win.
[01:15:42.848 --> 01:15:46.731]  But if we go along with the creature that's got us in its jaws, we're going to lose.
[01:15:47.011 --> 01:15:51.214]  Don't forget, the news websites are Infowars.com and Newswars.com.
[01:15:51.254 --> 01:15:58.179]  And I also will ask Carlos Zapata, the best place for people to visit him, I guess it's at Carlos underscore Zapata underscore one.
[01:15:58.679 --> 01:16:02.362]  And on Instagram, Carlos dot Zapata dot nine zero.
[01:16:03.268 --> 01:16:15.502]  When I put up this graphic for TV viewers and describe it for radio listeners, I'm not exaggerating that you've got the dam of the republic and what's left of freedom of speech and the second amendment that's symbolized by info wars as the tip of the spear.
[01:16:15.562 --> 01:16:19.146]  And you've got the destructive force of communism just waiting to crush you and your family.
[01:16:19.266 --> 01:16:24.992]  I need to hold on as long as possible, and so I'm telling you, go to Infoworkstore.com, get your high-quality, affordable food.
[01:16:25.092 --> 01:16:27.034]  It's drop-shipped by my page, rated super high-quality.
[01:16:27.414 --> 01:16:30.377]  One to two weeks before the big rush comes, and order the supplements.
[01:16:30.537 --> 01:16:39.165]  Because I gotta tell you, I have to make the decision in the next week on whether I'm gonna have everything go to full price, because we can't get most of the supplements anymore, because the supply chain's breaking down, not just for us, but everybody.
[01:16:39.185 --> 01:16:44.030]  And I won't get the crap that they've got out there and downgrade our products and, you know, reformulate them and make them weaker.
[01:16:44.170 --> 01:16:45.471]  I'm telling you, stuff's breaking down.
[01:16:45.511 --> 01:16:46.291]  It's bad, okay?
[01:16:46.511 --> 01:16:47.552]  And it's not just that.
[01:16:47.632 --> 01:16:48.613]  It's all the other attacks.
[01:16:48.713 --> 01:16:50.273]  And so, we're going to be in this together.
[01:16:50.674 --> 01:16:51.634]  I don't feel sorry for myself.
[01:16:51.994 --> 01:16:52.835]  I'm sorry for America.
[01:16:53.555 --> 01:16:58.158]  And when Trump gets back in, which they're probably not going to be able to stop him, because America's waking up.
[01:16:59.226 --> 01:17:00.527]  They're going to bring in the depression.
[01:17:00.587 --> 01:17:01.927]  I don't know how he's going to hold it off.
[01:17:02.067 --> 01:17:05.829]  They've paid off all the right-wing pundits to say, oh, we're devaluing things.
[01:17:05.909 --> 01:17:06.689]  The dollar's dead.
[01:17:06.729 --> 01:17:07.910]  Trump shouldn't be doing stimulus.
[01:17:08.070 --> 01:17:10.271]  If we don't do the stimulus, we're going to totally collapse.
[01:17:10.291 --> 01:17:11.011]  That's their plan.
[01:17:11.151 --> 01:17:13.052]  Of course what he's doing long term will be bad.
[01:17:13.132 --> 01:17:14.593]  We don't have a choice anymore!
[01:17:14.813 --> 01:17:16.533]  Anybody that understands economics knows that.
[01:17:16.613 --> 01:17:21.756]  We need political power and control of our country because it's ideology that can build everything back.
[01:17:21.996 --> 01:17:24.317]  If we don't have the ideology of the Republic and America,
[01:17:25.077 --> 01:17:26.738]  And freedom, it won't matter.
[01:17:27.458 --> 01:17:28.438]  They're making their move.
[01:17:28.458 --> 01:17:29.438]  I'm getting chills right now.
[01:17:29.918 --> 01:17:32.899]  Every channel, every show, the dollar's dead, America's over.
[01:17:33.259 --> 01:17:35.480]  You know, Wall Street now bearish on the dollar.
[01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:38.001]  On and on and on, they're making their move.
[01:17:38.161 --> 01:17:45.503]  And empires and republics fall very, very incrementally from rotting within, but then finally like an old barn, when a tornado comes by, they blow over, they blow down.
[01:17:45.623 --> 01:17:47.886]  And they're huffing and they're puffing, trying to blow our barn down.
[01:17:47.986 --> 01:17:52.451]  And Trump's trying to put in some new logs, put in some new spikes, put in some new nails.
[01:17:52.571 --> 01:17:56.035]  He's trying to shore things up with sandbags, because the storm's here.
[01:17:56.276 --> 01:18:02.964]  And it's the global government New World Order storm to bring down the Republic and bring in the post-human era and lock everything down.
[01:18:03.104 --> 01:18:04.646]  And Trump's fighting the lockdown.
[01:18:05.006 --> 01:18:11.231]  Everything InfoWars has done for 26 years, everything you've done in your life of being informed and being involved, is building towards this point.
[01:18:11.291 --> 01:18:12.372]  And this isn't a normal time.
[01:18:12.472 --> 01:18:13.313]  And I know you know that.
[01:18:13.393 --> 01:18:14.474]  And I salute you and I thank you.
[01:18:14.554 --> 01:18:19.438]  But when you call in thanking me for trying to self-preserve myself and you, we're in the same boat, brother.
[01:18:19.638 --> 01:18:19.998]  I get it.
[01:18:20.098 --> 01:18:21.559]  I appreciate you just as much as you appreciate me.
[01:18:21.599 --> 01:18:23.060]  But I'm telling you, this is serious.
[01:18:23.321 --> 01:18:25.923]  And the country needs to be prayed for, and you need to pray for yourself.
[01:18:26.203 --> 01:18:27.443]  I'm telling you, we make it easy.
[01:18:27.463 --> 01:18:28.904]  We got things that make your life better.
[01:18:28.984 --> 01:18:30.404]  We got things that are essential you need.
[01:18:30.584 --> 01:18:32.324]  And we've got the information warfare.
[01:18:32.384 --> 01:18:33.304]  You've got the power.
[01:18:33.445 --> 01:18:33.665]  Use it.
[01:18:33.845 --> 01:18:35.965]  You need a four-stage ion filter.
[01:18:36.025 --> 01:18:37.325]  We have the best at the lowest price.
[01:18:37.345 --> 01:18:38.286]  Because that's what I do!
[01:18:38.566 --> 01:18:39.586]  We have the best storable food.
[01:18:39.806 --> 01:18:40.926]  Highest quality you're gonna get.
[01:18:41.086 --> 01:18:42.326]  Unless you pay five times more.
[01:18:42.506 --> 01:18:43.527]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:18:43.647 --> 01:18:44.347]  The best prices.
[01:18:44.407 --> 01:18:45.227]  It's all there.
[01:18:45.327 --> 01:18:47.687]  But we've only got the ability to do business now.
[01:18:47.868 --> 01:18:49.208]  We're not gonna have it much longer.
[01:18:49.348 --> 01:18:50.368]  If the enemy has their way.
[01:18:50.448 --> 01:18:50.948]  I'm telling you.
[01:18:50.968 --> 01:18:52.208]  I used to say support InfoWars.
[01:18:52.368 --> 01:18:53.269]  Rescue InfoWars.
[01:18:53.349 --> 01:18:54.029]  Save yourself.
[01:18:54.149 --> 01:18:54.749]  Save the world.
[01:18:54.909 --> 01:18:55.749]  We're in this together.
[01:18:55.769 --> 01:18:56.690]  Because let me tell you something.
[01:18:56.710 --> 01:18:57.670]  Communism's up here.
[01:18:57.890 --> 01:19:00.851]  Infowars is the damn blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[01:19:01.231 --> 01:19:03.052]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[01:19:03.272 --> 01:19:04.813]  My children are right here!
[01:19:05.533 --> 01:19:10.274]  With pedophiles and devil worshippers and forced inoculations and FEMA camps coming for us!
[01:19:10.475 --> 01:19:10.975]  And war!
[01:19:12.015 --> 01:19:14.017]  If we don't fix this now, we're gonna have to fight.
[01:19:14.137 --> 01:19:17.879]  So we're trying to hold the dam against the Satanists and the armies of hell.
[01:19:18.079 --> 01:19:23.243]  We pray to Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father for the lead God to direct us against this enemy!
[01:19:23.423 --> 01:19:25.164]  But I need money to fight a war!
[01:19:25.364 --> 01:19:26.425]  And I need word of mouth!
[01:19:26.625 --> 01:19:27.485]  And I need prayer!
[01:19:27.666 --> 01:19:28.566]  And I need action!
[01:19:29.026 --> 01:19:30.548]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[01:19:31.408 --> 01:19:32.929]  That dam's already got holes in it!
[01:19:33.449 --> 01:19:37.412]  And the enemy's telling you, don't stick your fingers in it, don't block it, everything's fine.
[01:19:37.612 --> 01:19:39.693]  Peaches and cream are on the other side.
[01:19:39.913 --> 01:19:40.453]  No!
[01:19:40.974 --> 01:19:42.795]  You know it's not peaches and cream!
[01:19:42.975 --> 01:19:44.956]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[01:19:45.756 --> 01:19:46.657]  One way or another!
[01:19:47.758 --> 01:19:52.941]  Only question is, do we have a president in the middle of the fight against the new world order, or is it going to be us that does it?
[01:19:53.561 --> 01:19:54.782]  But we know we're not giving up!
[01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:09.514]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:20:10.035 --> 01:20:11.376]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:20.226 --> 01:20:21.427]  From the front lines.
[01:20:23.444 --> 01:20:28.529]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:38.580]  So folks used to hear us 20-something years ago talking about all this, saying that sounds crazy, nobody throw away America and all this freedom and all the wealth.
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:41.422]  We got problems, but no one would throw it away for North Korea or Cuba.
[01:20:41.442 --> 01:20:44.325]  You don't understand, there's powerful interests behind it.
[01:20:45.219 --> 01:20:46.140]  That want that.
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:49.224]  It's not Kim Jong-un or Kim Jong-il or Fidel Castro you're fighting.
[01:20:49.605 --> 01:20:51.047]  It's the multinational banks.
[01:20:51.287 --> 01:20:53.950]  It's the consortiums that are now out in the open.
[01:20:55.086 --> 01:20:55.526]  Hey, I'm sorry.
[01:21:19.999 --> 01:21:22.122]  I've been a student of history my whole life.
[01:21:22.182 --> 01:21:27.688]  I was a history major in college, which doesn't really mean anything, but I've read a lot and I've experienced a lot.
[01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:35.697]  And I'll tell you that I've always felt like there was an attack on the American male, an attack on the alpha male.
[01:21:35.958 --> 01:21:40.383]  And from the time we were kids, we were told that you can't fight, you can't cuss, you can't talk aggressively.
[01:21:40.816 --> 01:21:42.177]  You can't make fast decisions.
[01:21:42.597 --> 01:21:47.662]  You can't, uh, you can't win, you know, and we're to the point now where you got to think about this.
[01:21:47.702 --> 01:21:51.545]  You know, we've got to the point in America and the world where we actually play sports.
[01:21:51.985 --> 01:21:53.506]  We don't allow a team to win.
[01:21:53.526 --> 01:21:54.767]  Think about how ludicrous that is.
[01:21:55.248 --> 01:22:02.854]  If you don't think that that eats away at the soul of a man or a soul of a human, then you're absolutely blind, you know, because you're doing nobody any favors.
[01:22:02.874 --> 01:22:03.995]  You're not doing any.
[01:22:05.778 --> 01:22:06.919]  Participation trophy.
[01:22:06.959 --> 01:22:09.141]  And this is a community and society that we live in now.
[01:22:09.821 --> 01:22:12.563]  And you got to ask yourself, why are they doing this?
[01:22:12.703 --> 01:22:22.090]  Are they really doing it because they want that loser kid to feel better about himself or that person that maybe makes a bad decision and not to feel the consequences of it?
[01:22:22.170 --> 01:22:31.697]  No, they do this because they know that if they eat away at our drive to win, they can start to inject and interject these socialist policies and these communist policies.
[01:22:32.018 --> 01:22:34.960]  They know that eventually they're going to try to make us all the same.
[01:22:35.265 --> 01:22:37.826]  Well, there's no winners, no losers, and we've seen this coming, right?
[01:22:37.846 --> 01:22:43.950]  I mean, I have four children, and I think that's maybe why I have a voice in the community, because I'm every dad, I'm every American, you know?
[01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:48.872]  I have a business, I have a family, and I see it in my kids, you know, where our kids are being raised now to
[01:22:50.998 --> 01:22:53.519]  To feel guilty if they're better than the next kid.
[01:22:53.659 --> 01:23:00.142]  They're made to feel like they need to regress or be less in order to be like everybody else, you know.
[01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:10.906]  And if you have half a brain between your ears, you know that that leads to absolute, absolute just loss, loss of culture, loss of economy, loss of everything.
[01:23:15.383 --> 01:23:17.565]  They don't want to put pressure on kids to make them excel.
[01:23:17.845 --> 01:23:19.387]  And I remember, I was not a good soccer player.
[01:23:19.407 --> 01:23:21.629]  When I was like six years old, they put me in soccer.
[01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:23.990]  I remember being at the pizza place at the end of the year.
[01:23:24.551 --> 01:23:27.714]  And they were giving out the participation trophies, and nobody told me what they were.
[01:23:28.214 --> 01:23:31.156]  But I knew I wasn't good at it, so it made me want to quit.
[01:23:31.517 --> 01:23:33.358]  Because I wasn't mad at the kids that got the big trophy.
[01:23:33.498 --> 01:23:34.579]  I knew I didn't deserve it.
[01:23:34.919 --> 01:23:40.164]  And even as a mammal, as a male, as a human, I knew there was something wrong with that.
[01:23:40.604 --> 01:23:41.625]  That I didn't deserve that.
[01:23:41.885 --> 01:23:43.507]  So you're talking about the other side of it.
[01:23:44.207 --> 01:23:47.288]  The kids that excel, they're saying, you excelling doesn't matter.
[01:23:47.308 --> 01:23:50.509]  And then that takes the drive out of people, which makes them soulless.
[01:23:51.930 --> 01:23:54.771]  100 percent, you know, a thousand percent.
[01:23:55.271 --> 01:23:58.792]  And people like you, people like me, people like the kids that we're raising understand this.
[01:23:58.812 --> 01:24:00.653]  They understand that there is a loser and there's a winner.
[01:24:01.133 --> 01:24:03.074]  And here's the deal.
[01:24:03.454 --> 01:24:04.914]  You know, it's OK to make mistakes.
[01:24:05.014 --> 01:24:05.855]  It's OK to fail.
[01:24:06.115 --> 01:24:06.315]  Right.
[01:24:06.635 --> 01:24:12.377]  But we can't live in a society where we don't allow people to fail because in all the failures that I've found my success, that I've found my way,
[01:24:13.173 --> 01:24:15.834]  Around towards success, right?
[01:24:16.074 --> 01:24:25.117]  So you can't make a good decision unless you know what a bad decision feels like smells like, you know, and and I've made plenty of those, you know, which is why I am where I am.
[01:24:25.597 --> 01:24:36.700]  But, you know, Alice, I think we're in the most existential crisis that we've ever been in in our lives, you know, in my 41 years on this Earth, I never would have thought that we'd be fighting for our very identity.
[01:24:37.361 --> 01:24:41.162]  And I know you've talked about this before, but when they're knocking down statues of our history,
[01:24:42.273 --> 01:24:47.457]  That's knocking down a statue of who we are today, you know, of who I am as a person.
[01:24:47.797 --> 01:24:49.499]  Now, am I a racist?
[01:24:49.559 --> 01:24:49.699]  No.
[01:24:49.719 --> 01:24:50.620]  Have I ever been a racist?
[01:24:50.700 --> 01:24:50.900]  No.
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.101]  Will I ever be a racist?
[01:24:52.201 --> 01:24:52.421]  No.
[01:24:53.522 --> 01:25:02.749]  But, you know, to say that I'm a bad person because I think that we should have Confederate statues in the South does not make me a bad person.
[01:25:02.769 --> 01:25:05.972]  It makes me a student of history, a person that understands that
[01:25:06.480 --> 01:25:10.342]  If we erase how we got here, we erase our identity, and that's what they want.
[01:25:10.382 --> 01:25:13.684]  At the end of the day, they want a bunch of robots that are simply going to do what they say.
[01:25:14.604 --> 01:25:15.144]  And we're seeing that.
[01:25:15.164 --> 01:25:15.765]  We're seeing the result.
[01:25:15.785 --> 01:25:18.706]  Listen, I hate to admit it, but they're winning.
[01:25:19.187 --> 01:25:29.072]  They've gotten us to a point where I live in a town of 1,200 people, and I go to the grocery store, and I see people who are otherwise pretty tough, country-living people wearing masks all of a sudden.
[01:25:30.319 --> 01:25:33.221]  You know, three months ago they weren't, but they've been talked into this.
[01:25:33.241 --> 01:25:34.242]  They've been felt guilty.
[01:25:34.322 --> 01:25:36.364]  And when I asked them, why are you wearing this mask?
[01:25:36.624 --> 01:25:38.346]  They said, well, I just don't want the confrontation.
[01:25:38.406 --> 01:25:43.890]  You know, I just get anxiety from thinking that somebody's going to approach me and tell me to put a mask on.
[01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:45.592]  I said, well, you know, that's the problem.
[01:25:45.612 --> 01:25:49.395]  The problem is, is that going back to what I said earlier, we've been taught that confrontation's bad.
[01:25:49.615 --> 01:25:50.656]  We've been taught that fighting's bad.
[01:25:50.676 --> 01:25:53.278]  We've been taught that standing up for yourself is bad, you know?
[01:25:54.989 --> 01:25:56.670]  And I don't know, I've been a fighter my whole life.
[01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:59.092]  I love to fight, so I have no problem walking by somebody.
[01:25:59.112 --> 01:26:05.157]  And once they get you, as you know, Mr. Zapata, to give up on the one thing, now it's going to be contact tracing.
[01:26:05.197 --> 01:26:12.982]  California's announced, when you go to any grocery store or business, they're going to write on who you are, put it in a database, and then comes the contact tracing, then comes the forced inoculation.
[01:26:13.023 --> 01:26:13.583]  They admit.
[01:26:13.603 --> 01:26:14.804]  It's not like we're speculating.
[01:26:14.824 --> 01:26:16.125]  This is coming very soon.
[01:26:16.145 --> 01:26:17.025]  You talk about war.
[01:26:17.386 --> 01:26:18.246]  It's one thing to shut down a business.
[01:26:18.266 --> 01:26:19.527]  It's no business speculation at all.
[01:26:20.848 --> 01:26:21.389]  Keep going, sorry.
[01:26:22.165 --> 01:26:23.746]  No, it's no longer speculation at all.
[01:26:23.786 --> 01:26:30.911]  A day's coming where they're going to tell me that I cannot have a business license unless I have a vaccine for this COVID, fake COVID virus.
[01:26:31.452 --> 01:26:32.152]  I'm telling you, it's coming.
[01:26:33.293 --> 01:26:33.754]  No, I agree.
[01:26:33.794 --> 01:26:38.257]  So when you say, lie in the sand, I'm ready to go to war, I mean, it's not like we're starting a fight.
[01:26:38.317 --> 01:26:40.519]  They're coming with medical tyranny.
[01:26:40.539 --> 01:26:45.022]  Have you seen Australia, where they're beating up women and arresting women that organize demonstrations?
[01:26:45.862 --> 01:26:46.062]  Yes.
[01:26:47.063 --> 01:26:47.924]  And that's coming soon.
[01:26:48.144 --> 01:26:50.526]  So things that we're seeing now even in our own cities, right?
[01:26:51.306 --> 01:26:52.667]  Look at Portland, look at Seattle.
[01:26:52.707 --> 01:27:01.134]  We're seeing things that five years ago we were watching on the news in third world countries and thanking God that we were Americans and that would never happen here.
[01:27:01.734 --> 01:27:03.596]  And here we are now having this conversation, Alex,
[01:27:04.462 --> 01:27:08.064]  You know, six hours away, people are killing people because of who they're voting for.
[01:27:08.084 --> 01:27:10.346]  You know, because the guy's a Trump supporter and he's getting killed in the street.
[01:27:10.366 --> 01:27:11.847]  Because we thought it could never happen.
[01:27:11.887 --> 01:27:12.327]  That's key.
[01:27:12.347 --> 01:27:12.807]  Get into that.
[01:27:13.188 --> 01:27:18.431]  We have just been sleeping on our laurels, living on our laurels, and people need to get, no, the assaults now.
[01:27:18.471 --> 01:27:19.612]  This isn't another probe.
[01:27:19.932 --> 01:27:20.452]  It's not a joke.
[01:27:20.552 --> 01:27:21.253]  This is the attack.
[01:27:22.116 --> 01:27:23.037]  Yeah, we are here.
[01:27:23.097 --> 01:27:24.379]  They've crossed the line of departure.
[01:27:24.619 --> 01:27:26.921]  I've been called a domestic terrorist since my speech.
[01:27:27.282 --> 01:27:28.403]  I've been called an insider.
[01:27:28.423 --> 01:27:31.446]  I've been called a lot of things by some people.
[01:27:31.827 --> 01:27:40.036]  But let me tell you that I've gotten literally hundreds of thousands of text messages, emails, Facebook messages, Instagram messages, Twitter.
[01:27:40.576 --> 01:27:40.816]  Okay?
[01:27:41.136 --> 01:27:43.978]  Of people that say, just let us know when and we will be there.
[01:27:44.318 --> 01:27:48.381]  If I put up the balloon right now and I said, hey, I need a million people here with guns, they would show up.
[01:27:48.681 --> 01:27:49.861]  And that's leadership, brother.
[01:27:49.961 --> 01:27:50.402]  Exactly.
[01:27:50.422 --> 01:27:52.063]  And that's what scares the system.
[01:27:52.143 --> 01:27:53.363]  I think they jumped the gun.
[01:27:53.664 --> 01:27:54.964]  They were planning this later.
[01:27:55.945 --> 01:27:59.367]  But Trump made them launch a plan that they had planned maybe a decade from now.
[01:28:00.199 --> 01:28:03.141]  Yeah, and they've underestimated guys like me and guys like you.
[01:28:03.161 --> 01:28:10.424]  They've underestimated the fact that, you know what, us veterans, we look forward to peaceful lives and raising our families in the way that we see fit.
[01:28:10.484 --> 01:28:23.831]  But if we have to go to war, we have to remember that the oath that we swore, the oath when I raised my right hand as a younger man to uphold and defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic, that did not end with my contract.
[01:28:24.452 --> 01:28:26.913]  The day that I left active duty, that contract
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:32.884]  Between me and the Constitution, between me and my country, stays very much alive.
[01:28:32.904 --> 01:28:39.050]  Until the day that I die, until the day that I take my last breath, you know, I have to uphold that oath, you know, of fighting.
[01:28:39.250 --> 01:28:39.690]  Stay there.
[01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:40.651]  You're on fire.
[01:28:40.671 --> 01:28:43.954]  We're going to come back and you're going to continue on with what's coming next.
[01:28:44.614 --> 01:28:45.175]  Absolutely.
[01:28:45.355 --> 01:28:48.077]  And again, you swore an oath, you're still following it.
[01:28:48.237 --> 01:28:48.618]  All of us.
[01:28:49.770 --> 01:28:51.411]  No, we're going under slavery here.
[01:28:51.751 --> 01:28:53.371]  So this is survival now, too.
[01:28:54.312 --> 01:28:57.613]  And the more people lay down, the more they're in denial, the worse it's going to get.
[01:28:57.693 --> 01:28:58.133]  Stay with us.
[01:28:58.173 --> 01:29:04.676]  Carlos Zapata straight ahead.
[01:29:05.236 --> 01:29:19.002]  Snowden and others taught us how mobile phones are constantly spying on us, not just tracking and recording our GPS location, but recording audio and video as well, with or without a battery.
[01:29:19.782 --> 01:29:25.169]  Now, with the InfoWars Privacy Pouch, you can go dark wherever you choose.
[01:29:25.890 --> 01:29:26.331]  Excellent.

[01:29:58.522 --> 01:29:59.603]  InfoWarStore.com
[01:30:04.143 --> 01:30:05.183]  I want them shut down.
[01:30:05.263 --> 01:30:06.023]  I want them silent.
[01:30:06.083 --> 01:30:07.024]  I want them muted.
[01:30:07.044 --> 01:30:08.904]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:30:10.124 --> 01:30:14.505]  I didn't back down from my promises and I've kept every single one.
[01:30:19.106 --> 01:30:21.567]  This current administration has made hope possible.
[01:30:25.287 --> 01:30:28.388]  We want this nation to continue to
[01:30:29.636 --> 01:30:32.217]  Be the beacon of hope for the world.
[01:30:32.597 --> 01:30:36.498]  How many people said they're gonna leave America if Donald Trump was elected?
[01:30:36.678 --> 01:30:41.300]  They're all still here and they're not going anywhere because we are in the land of the free.
[01:30:41.740 --> 01:30:45.942]  We will never ever sign bad trade deals!
[01:30:46.202 --> 01:30:48.303]  America first again!
[01:30:48.663 --> 01:30:49.883]  America first!
[01:30:49.943 --> 01:30:52.104]  America's great USMCA trade deal.
[01:30:52.164 --> 01:30:54.045]  This is a big win for the United States of America.
[01:30:54.085 --> 01:30:54.985]  This is a great trade deal.
[01:30:55.185 --> 01:31:00.330]  We are going to lift the restrictions on the production of American energy.
[01:31:01.030 --> 01:31:04.373]  We will create millions of more jobs.
[01:31:04.634 --> 01:31:10.659]  Hope to me is the belief in a better tomorrow and creating a better future for our children.
[01:31:10.899 --> 01:31:16.805]  When I look in the eyes of my grandchildren, I want them to know that their papa was not silent.
[01:31:17.625 --> 01:31:27.408]  We will rescue kids from failing schools by helping their parents send them to a safe school of their choice.
[01:31:31.184 --> 01:31:35.065]  We will completely rebuild our depleted military.
[01:31:35.145 --> 01:31:45.747]  The countries that we are protecting, at a massive cost to us, will be asked to pay their fair share.
[01:31:46.507 --> 01:31:53.749]  We will take care of our great veterans like they have never been taken care of before.
[01:31:54.409 --> 01:31:54.789]  It's Tyson.
[01:31:55.349 --> 01:31:55.569]  Yeah.
[01:31:56.089 --> 01:31:57.810]  He saved me, thanks to him.
[01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:59.330]  I'm here.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.723]  To me, he's giving people hope.
[01:32:06.724 --> 01:32:10.909]  What he's doing for the poor people, what he's doing for everybody.
[01:32:11.664 --> 01:32:22.230]  We are going to appoint justices of the United States Supreme Court who will uphold our laws and our Constitution.
[01:32:22.550 --> 01:32:26.152]  By supporting law enforcement, it's so important for keeping America great.
[01:32:26.393 --> 01:32:31.355]  As long as I'm president, I will never defund your police, that I promise you.
[01:32:32.816 --> 01:32:37.639]  It's time to deliver a victory for the American people.
[01:32:37.739 --> 01:32:40.401]  We are going to start winning again.
[01:32:43.812 --> 01:33:01.937]  It's called Promises Made, Promises Made.
[01:33:05.538 --> 01:33:11.460]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:28.621 --> 01:33:34.323]  The past is gone, and where am I?
[01:33:34.423 --> 01:33:38.505]  Like dust to dust.
[01:33:39.465 --> 01:33:41.866]  Isn't that the way?
[01:33:42.166 --> 01:33:44.647]  Everybody's got their dues in life.
[01:33:53.610 --> 01:33:57.754]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen, and sometimes you gotta lose to know how to win.
[01:33:57.774 --> 01:33:59.596]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[01:33:59.636 --> 01:34:11.967]  Carlos Zapata is our guest, a Marine Corps veteran of Iraq, and a father and a business owner out in California in Shasta County, dealing with all this garbage with the supervisors in Redding.
[01:34:12.688 --> 01:34:14.970]  And he gave that speech, but I want people to understand something.
[01:34:15.010 --> 01:34:16.631]  We're not up here trying to act dramatic.
[01:34:17.512 --> 01:34:19.734]  This is the whole build-up of the takeover.
[01:34:19.774 --> 01:34:23.077]  The globalists admit, now at Davos, this is their reset.
[01:34:23.097 --> 01:34:24.218]  This is to teach you to be poor.
[01:34:24.498 --> 01:34:25.959]  This is to get rid of small businesses.
[01:34:25.979 --> 01:34:27.180]  You talk about discrimination.
[01:34:27.481 --> 01:34:28.962]  They talk about black or white all day.
[01:34:29.282 --> 01:34:34.747]  What about small businesses can't be opened but Walmart and Target and Governor Newsom's wineries can?
[01:34:35.167 --> 01:34:39.050]  This is so obvious, and then they admit it's a vertical integration.
[01:34:39.110 --> 01:34:41.553]  So, you talked about in that speech,
[01:34:42.622 --> 01:34:45.724]  Things are going to get physical because you're physically starving us.
[01:34:45.744 --> 01:34:47.626]  You're physically trying to forcibly inoculate us.
[01:34:47.886 --> 01:34:53.970]  You're physically, you are attacking us with, you know, fifth generational warfare.
[01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:58.033]  And as a man, as a father, I'm not trying to prove myself.
[01:34:58.053 --> 01:34:59.034]  I'm not looking for a fight.
[01:35:00.134 --> 01:35:04.558]  But genetically, at a cellular level, I can't get my mind out of it now.
[01:35:04.718 --> 01:35:09.962]  As I see we're under assault, I'd be in Stockholm Syndrome if I decided to just go along with it.
[01:35:09.982 --> 01:35:14.586]  So how do we get the public not to go under Stockholm Syndrome, but not start a shooting war?
[01:35:15.006 --> 01:35:18.449]  Is there a third rail, a way to get out of this before it's too late?
[01:35:20.222 --> 01:35:28.351]  You know, the mechanisms are set in place through our Constitution, you know, but the problem is, Alex, is that the Constitution has been completely disregarded at this point.
[01:35:28.652 --> 01:35:35.179]  You know, if we were still operating under constitutional law and constitutional ideals, we wouldn't be having
[01:35:35.199 --> 01:35:35.319]  Yes.
[01:35:54.088 --> 01:35:57.090]  For our ideas, then our message means absolutely nothing.
[01:35:57.790 --> 01:36:06.435]  And that's what's happened, you know, that they've taken advantage of our kindness, of our weakness, that they've mistaken our kindness for weakness, because they thought that we would never actually go into that kinetic fight.
[01:36:07.476 --> 01:36:07.976]  And we will.
[01:36:08.276 --> 01:36:13.979]  And we have to, because, listen, I've done well for myself, but I can't afford to lose any more money.
[01:36:14.060 --> 01:36:18.322]  I can't afford to have a closed business that I've put half a million dollars of my own money into.
[01:36:18.755 --> 01:36:24.459]  In the last year, you know, and there's other businesses that aren't going to be okay other businesses that won't open again.
[01:36:24.839 --> 01:36:29.322]  So you've taken away our most fundamental right, which is what the pursuit of happiness, right?
[01:36:29.723 --> 01:36:44.533]  The pursuit of happiness was put written for a reason because somebody knew that one day we would be able to open our business, but they also knew that someday somebody was gonna be able to take that away from us and the foresight that our forefathers had.
[01:36:44.952 --> 01:36:45.032]  It's
[01:37:02.119 --> 01:37:05.281]  ...are so good at feeding off of the vulnerable, right?
[01:37:05.321 --> 01:37:07.523]  So let's talk about what's happened in Central America.
[01:37:07.543 --> 01:37:08.323]  What happened there?
[01:37:08.683 --> 01:37:10.785]  They preyed on the least of these, right?
[01:37:10.805 --> 01:37:16.588]  They preyed on the native population that was uneducated, and they turned them against the white man, against the European man, right?
[01:37:16.768 --> 01:37:19.150]  And they told them that it was their fault that they were where they were.
[01:37:19.170 --> 01:37:20.351]  It was their fault that they weren't educated.
[01:37:20.371 --> 01:37:24.914]  It was their fault they didn't have good schools or housing or whatever, you know?
[01:37:26.255 --> 01:37:29.797]  And they're doing the exact same here, but let's call it the black population, okay?
[01:37:30.357 --> 01:37:34.679]  They've taken a black population, a fatherless society, and turned them against everybody else.
[01:37:34.699 --> 01:37:35.880]  This is what we're seeing.
[01:37:35.940 --> 01:37:38.982]  BLM and Antifa gaining ground in this country.
[01:37:39.162 --> 01:37:43.384]  Without that population, they would have nothing, because the rest of us aren't going to fall for that.
[01:37:43.644 --> 01:37:45.865]  Now listen, this is not a knock on a black community.
[01:37:45.885 --> 01:37:51.228]  In fact, I have... You're talking about Liberation Theology, the CIA, the foundations.
[01:37:51.308 --> 01:37:51.888]  It's on record.
[01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:54.490]  They take schisms and manipulate them for division.
[01:37:54.510 --> 01:37:54.490]  100%.
[01:37:55.410 --> 01:37:58.572]  And there are some great black leaders coming out of this, and I think that
[01:37:58.974 --> 01:38:08.480]  That the black community is awakening now and seeing that they've been taken advantage of, they're being raped, and they absolutely are being kept under the thumb of the liberal government.
[01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:09.741]  Look at Kanye West!
[01:38:09.761 --> 01:38:10.482]  Look at Kanye West!
[01:38:10.502 --> 01:38:10.482]  100%.
[01:38:10.522 --> 01:38:12.023]  Look at folks like David Harris Jr.
[01:38:12.203 --> 01:38:13.324]  That's a good friend of mine, you know?
[01:38:13.604 --> 01:38:16.386]  People who are intelligent and coming out and saying, look, we need to address a problem.
[01:38:16.766 --> 01:38:22.430]  And if it makes me a racist to address a serious problem because I want you to fix it, then label me what you will.
[01:38:23.130 --> 01:38:25.011]  But I'll say that, look, I'm trying to fix the problem.
[01:38:25.311 --> 01:38:28.732]  Unless we identify what the issue is, we can't fix it, right?
[01:38:28.752 --> 01:38:31.032]  So what is the heart of the matter?
[01:38:31.092 --> 01:38:36.434]  It's the megacorporations playing us against each other using psychological warfare, cheating.
[01:38:37.254 --> 01:38:38.475]  They need to be brought to justice.
[01:38:39.495 --> 01:38:40.155]  It's absolute.
[01:38:40.595 --> 01:38:42.616]  This whole thing is a psychological operation, you know.
[01:38:43.624 --> 01:38:54.131]  I had an opportunity to work with, I was in the Marine Corps, but I worked with the Army PSYOP guys when I was in Iraq, and I'm seeing exactly the playbook that they would use.
[01:38:54.171 --> 01:38:58.794]  If I was in a controlled population, I would use the playbook that's been set out for these guys already.
[01:38:58.994 --> 01:39:00.635]  All you have to do is read the book and you know where we're going.
[01:39:00.655 --> 01:39:01.696]  This does not end well for us.
[01:39:01.716 --> 01:39:03.457]  Not today, not tomorrow, not 10 years from now.
[01:39:03.817 --> 01:39:04.858]  It never ends well for us.
[01:39:04.878 --> 01:39:06.979]  The only way is to realize the game and not play it.
[01:39:08.453 --> 01:39:09.453]  Oh, you have to.
[01:39:09.954 --> 01:39:13.755]  And going back to what I said earlier, I am absolutely appalled and I'm disgusted.
[01:39:13.775 --> 01:39:21.879]  I want to throw up every time I see a friend of mine or somebody that I respected before play the game simply because, well, I can't afford not to.
[01:39:21.899 --> 01:39:22.880]  I have to keep my job.
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:24.760]  No, I have to comply.
[01:39:25.601 --> 01:39:25.761]  Well.
[01:39:26.625 --> 01:39:29.668]  I'm trying to save my words, you know, because I don't want to offend you.
[01:39:29.708 --> 01:39:31.309]  It's excessive approximation.
[01:39:31.609 --> 01:39:33.491]  We're being walked into total slavery.
[01:39:33.791 --> 01:39:35.913]  Complying doesn't get you ahead now.
[01:39:36.874 --> 01:39:38.455]  It means the takeover like Venezuela.
[01:39:39.596 --> 01:39:40.016]  Absolutely.
[01:39:40.236 --> 01:39:42.258]  And people say, they say, well, you know, it's just a mask, right?
[01:39:42.398 --> 01:39:43.479]  Oh, yeah, it's just a mask.
[01:39:43.879 --> 01:39:45.701]  You got to tell me you can't put on a mask.
[01:39:45.721 --> 01:39:46.922]  You can go fight for this country.
[01:39:47.342 --> 01:39:48.783]  No, it's what that mask signifies.
[01:39:48.903 --> 01:39:50.685]  That mask signifies absolute control.
[01:39:50.705 --> 01:39:54.288]  It signifies silencing myself, silencing my children.
[01:39:55.175 --> 01:39:56.436]  It signifies my identity.
[01:40:06.403 --> 01:40:08.644]  Cover somebody's face, it would take their identity.
[01:40:08.684 --> 01:40:09.805]  It would take their self-worth.
[01:40:09.825 --> 01:40:13.907]  And if you take away our self-worth, you eat away at the very soul of what makes us great, and that's what's happening.
[01:40:14.307 --> 01:40:22.751]  Let's talk about that in a moment, because I interrupted you, but what do you make of all the Democrats caught eating at restaurants they own, going to salons, not wearing masks?
[01:40:22.791 --> 01:40:29.274]  I mean, they know it's a fraud, so they'll arrest you if it's not their business, but if it's their pet business, then they can do it.
[01:40:30.629 --> 01:40:32.609]  You know, I don't think much of it.
[01:40:33.010 --> 01:40:34.730]  It doesn't surprise me one bit.
[01:40:35.110 --> 01:40:39.071]  You know, I was not even shocked at all from when I saw that Nancy Pelosi video.
[01:40:39.351 --> 01:40:40.191]  We know this about it.
[01:40:40.231 --> 01:40:41.131]  This is not a surprise.
[01:40:41.151 --> 01:40:41.891]  They're not hiding it.
[01:40:42.191 --> 01:40:42.972]  They're elitists.
[01:40:43.512 --> 01:40:44.512]  They hate the middle class.
[01:40:44.552 --> 01:40:48.453]  They want to eradicate the middle class, you know, because they can't control the middle class.
[01:40:48.713 --> 01:40:50.593]  They can control the lower classes with money.
[01:40:50.613 --> 01:40:55.694]  They can't control people like me, you know, and... They want domesticated people in a world of money.
[01:40:55.934 --> 01:40:58.375]  The middle class is the free undomesticated person.
[01:40:59.312 --> 01:41:00.653]  They want to kill the pioneer spirit.
[01:41:00.794 --> 01:41:01.474]  Remember why we're out here.
[01:41:01.494 --> 01:41:15.750]  I live out West, you know, the West was won by pioneers who were willing to fight for what they wanted, you know, with with no promise of victory, you know, they fought with no promise of victory knowing that there might be something else over the horizon, you know, that might benefit their families.
[01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:18.012]  So that pioneer spirit out here out West.
[01:41:18.293 --> 01:41:19.354]  I live in rural America.
[01:41:20.075 --> 01:41:21.416]  That's being trampled on.
[01:41:21.697 --> 01:41:24.500]  But it's the very people that are being trampled on that are going to fight.
[01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:25.882]  People like me will fight.
[01:41:25.942 --> 01:41:31.389]  And like I said before, I think you said what, 30, 40, let's call it 50 million people that would fight with us right now.
[01:41:33.339 --> 01:41:42.461]  That's right, let me play a short clip of a few months ago, this mirrors Pelosi, of Lightfoot, caught out at a salon and she goes, well I'm a public figure, I need to have my hair done.
[01:41:42.822 --> 01:41:44.322]  Oh, no one else needs a haircut?
[01:41:45.062 --> 01:41:46.663]  I had that haircut, you know, in a while.
[01:41:46.703 --> 01:41:48.623]  I shaved my head when this was coming, I knew it was coming.
[01:41:49.283 --> 01:41:51.264]  But, I mean, the elitism... I wore a hat.
[01:41:52.478 --> 01:42:05.787]  It's insane to say, I'm an elitist, I don't, I mean they're even blind to their elitism, this is beyond quote racism, this is classism, meaning in America we all have the same rights, not under them, it's incredible, here it is.
[01:42:10.148 --> 01:42:11.289]  You guys got live football player.
[01:42:11.889 --> 01:42:19.113]  I'm out in the public eye and you know I'm a person who I take my personal hygiene very seriously.
[01:42:19.674 --> 01:42:23.076]  As I said I felt like I needed to have a haircut.
[01:42:23.516 --> 01:42:26.338]  I'm not able to do that myself and so I got a haircut.
[01:42:27.011 --> 01:42:32.493]  And again, the full press conference is she was arresting people, opening their barbershops, but she goes, but I need a haircut!
[01:42:32.773 --> 01:42:37.575]  I mean, this woman is totally blind and totally un-self-aware.
[01:42:37.955 --> 01:42:42.277]  How the hell do you say you are arrested if you go get your hair cut?
[01:42:42.297 --> 01:42:48.920]  She even said in a speech, like a week before, I'll catch you at a barbershop, or I'll catch you in a bar, or I'll catch you in a restaurant, you're arrested.
[01:42:49.100 --> 01:42:51.060]  She's like, well, I'm important!
[01:42:51.180 --> 01:42:53.021]  I mean, I gotta get my hair done.
[01:42:53.381 --> 01:42:54.482]  What the hell?
[01:42:55.322 --> 01:42:56.482]  And same thing with Pelosi!
[01:42:57.043 --> 01:42:57.923]  Oh my God, Newsom!
[01:42:58.063 --> 01:43:00.684]  Admiral Agbar, whatever it is.
[01:43:00.744 --> 01:43:01.304]  We'll be right back.
[01:43:02.685 --> 01:43:11.808]  You know, I sleep really good at night because I do my research and then I come out and I tell you what I actually really believe is going on.
[01:43:11.828 --> 01:43:16.390]  I don't care what the censors or the bureaucrats or the corrupt, loveless mafia think.
[01:43:17.510 --> 01:43:21.512]  And Infowars has become a pro-human, pro-liberty leader.
[01:43:22.953 --> 01:43:24.935]  On the planet, because of your support.
[01:43:25.355 --> 01:43:34.903]  And I just keep coming back to you telling you thank you, because I don't think you understand it's not rhetoric when I tell you you're king, you're key, you're the ether in which we swim.
[01:43:35.323 --> 01:43:36.404]  We are all in this together.
[01:43:36.784 --> 01:43:39.246]  If you don't support InfoWars, if you don't spread the word, we're screwed.
[01:43:39.266 --> 01:43:44.751]  Now listen, I gained about 25 pounds in the last two months.
[01:43:45.732 --> 01:43:48.294]  And I said to myself, I am exercising
[01:43:49.475 --> 01:43:52.138]  I am eating as not as much as I even was.
[01:43:52.238 --> 01:43:52.838]  What's happening?
[01:43:52.918 --> 01:43:53.759]  Is it because I'm 46?
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:55.141]  About to be 47?
[01:43:56.322 --> 01:43:56.482]  No.
[01:43:56.502 --> 01:44:09.894]  About two and a half months ago, I cleaned off the little side desk in my studio that had my X2, had my DNA Force Plus, had the bodies, had a few of the other products that I religiously take, had the fish oil.
[01:44:10.834 --> 01:44:12.575]  Because it was a big mess, I got mad and cleaned it up.
[01:44:13.356 --> 01:44:15.598]  And so, I went, wait a minute, it's the X2.
[01:44:16.339 --> 01:44:25.506]  Because I remember when I first started taking it seven years ago, how I worked out all the time, swam up to two miles a day, couldn't get down from 280 pounds.
[01:44:26.647 --> 01:44:31.031]  And as soon as I went on good, clean atomic iodine, it turned out nobody else was selling or had.
[01:44:32.754 --> 01:44:33.875]  I lost like 45 pounds.
[01:44:33.915 --> 01:44:34.376]  Everybody saw it.
[01:44:34.396 --> 01:44:35.037]  It was incredible.
[01:44:35.677 --> 01:44:40.783]  And Dr. Grip told me, he said, you know, those sunspots you get, those will be a lot less once you have iodine.
[01:44:42.024 --> 01:44:46.029]  And what made me notice it was after a few months without taking it, I've been out in the sun, I had sunspots again.
[01:44:47.531 --> 01:44:49.453]  Two weeks ago, I put the iodine
[01:44:51.005 --> 01:44:54.186]  In the studio so that I would put it in the water and take it under my tongue every day.
[01:44:54.206 --> 01:45:00.729]  I started doing it two and a half weeks ago and it was like my wife two days ago goes, man your stomach was like getting really big.
[01:45:00.789 --> 01:45:02.090]  It's gone down like by a third.
[01:45:02.630 --> 01:45:03.250]  What are you doing?
[01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:04.231]  And I'm like I've been too busy.
[01:45:04.251 --> 01:45:07.132]  I haven't been really exercising but I've lost 15 pounds.
[01:45:08.473 --> 01:45:09.933]  15 pounds folks and it's X2.
[01:45:11.614 --> 01:45:12.515]  And again, I get it.
[01:45:12.535 --> 01:45:13.456]  I was never a supplement guy.
[01:45:13.836 --> 01:45:14.697]  It's what listeners want.
[01:45:14.737 --> 01:45:15.318]  People love it.
[01:45:15.598 --> 01:45:16.339]  I have sponsors.
[01:45:16.599 --> 01:45:17.220]  So I sold it.
[01:45:17.320 --> 01:45:21.964]  Then I started saying like eight years ago, seven years ago, why don't I just take what I sell?
[01:45:22.404 --> 01:45:24.106]  And it changed my life because these are really good products.
[01:45:24.126 --> 01:45:26.909]  Because I always got you the highest rated, you know, with sponsors.
[01:45:27.289 --> 01:45:28.570]  So I said, why not put it out myself?
[01:45:29.791 --> 01:45:29.992]  Show.
[01:45:32.017 --> 01:45:34.420]  I told the crew, keep it in all studios.
[01:45:34.881 --> 01:45:36.443]  Remind me to take it every day.
[01:45:37.204 --> 01:45:48.379]  My lord, my libido, my stamina, my eyesight, everything, especially as you get older and you're under high stress, this is the ultimate good halogen that counters the fluoride.
[01:45:48.459 --> 01:45:49.000]  It's incredible.
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:52.182]  Now look, it was sold out for months, the X2 Liquid.
[01:45:52.202 --> 01:45:53.402]  Let's take it out of the tub.
[01:45:53.963 --> 01:45:54.503]  Proprietary.
[01:45:54.883 --> 01:46:00.006]  It's back in, limited supply, but it's 50% off still and free shipping.
[01:46:00.086 --> 01:46:03.348]  I'm extending this right through September till it sells out.
[01:46:03.368 --> 01:46:05.870]  It'll probably sell out by the middle of September.
[01:46:06.290 --> 01:46:07.110]  And we have the new
[01:46:08.651 --> 01:46:13.414]  Iodine spray bottle with X2, the only true atomic iodine that's in a spray bottle.
[01:46:13.934 --> 01:46:14.535]  It's amazing.
[01:46:14.855 --> 01:46:16.376]  Check it out and all its different uses.
[01:46:16.716 --> 01:46:20.198]  The things it does for topically, but also internally.
[01:46:21.058 --> 01:46:22.379]  It's at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:46:22.759 --> 01:46:24.380]  That's how we finance this operation.
[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:25.781]  That's how we fund things.
[01:46:26.141 --> 01:46:27.242]  And they're all great products.
[01:46:27.262 --> 01:46:35.487]  So when I promote swearable food, or I promote, you know, that you better get guns because a collapse is coming, it's what I really believe is happening.
[01:46:36.007 --> 01:46:37.488]  And I'm trying to fight the collapse, but
[01:46:37.828 --> 01:46:43.050]  More and more it becomes a reality we better get ready and then hope we've got insurance we can eat the storable food.
[01:46:43.730 --> 01:46:51.674]  This is something that is game-changing and I've got to religiously remember to always take it because every time I turn around I'm tired and fat.
[01:46:52.034 --> 01:46:54.555]  It's because I've quit taking it and gotten out of the habit.
[01:46:54.855 --> 01:46:55.555]  Habituate it.
[01:46:55.975 --> 01:46:56.776]  It's changed my life.
[01:46:56.856 --> 01:46:57.656]  It's changed other lives.
[01:46:58.096 --> 01:46:59.197]  Thousands of five-star reviews.
[01:46:59.497 --> 01:47:00.377]  MFORESTORE.COM.
[01:47:00.577 --> 01:47:02.018]  Get your X2 and X3 today.
[01:47:05.535 --> 01:47:09.616]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:47:10.136 --> 01:47:11.456]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:20.258 --> 01:47:22.439]  Things are cliches because they're true.
[01:47:22.459 --> 01:47:24.159]  People say them over and over again.
[01:47:24.799 --> 01:47:26.900]  Well, it's always darkest before the dawn.
[01:47:27.657 --> 01:47:30.419]  There's another cliche, don't ever meet your heroes, they'll disappoint you.
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:37.385]  Well, meeting Carlos Zapata, who is a hero to us all, and is just common sense, two minutes, has not been disappointing.
[01:47:37.445 --> 01:47:48.854]  It's been empowering, and I want to invite him back in the war room, on the election countdown, on the David Knight Show, to get his analysis and topics he wants to cover, and things that are unfolding.
[01:47:48.894 --> 01:47:50.415]  Carlos, let me ask you this question.
[01:47:50.435 --> 01:47:54.819]  I mean, we went to break, you had another topic you were on, I said, hold over, I forget what it was.
[01:47:57.540 --> 01:47:59.321]  What do you think the globalists are thinking?
[01:47:59.361 --> 01:48:02.542]  I think they're just testing and probing to see what we'll put up with.
[01:48:02.562 --> 01:48:08.184]  The fact that they, the leadership, never get in trouble is why they think that they are invincible.
[01:48:08.985 --> 01:48:15.047]  Your thoughts on that and just on the election and on the destabilization and everything else that's happening?
[01:48:16.368 --> 01:48:18.129]  I think they push a little bit further every time.
[01:48:18.169 --> 01:48:22.911]  Every time something like this happens, they're going to push a little bit further to see how gullible we are.
[01:48:23.271 --> 01:48:25.853]  And we prove over and over again to be very gullible.
[01:48:25.933 --> 01:48:29.014]  We prove that we'll allow them to push the line more and more.
[01:48:29.815 --> 01:48:36.418]  And things that if you would have asked us a year ago, hey, at what point would you fight against
[01:48:37.133 --> 01:48:37.953]  A tyrannical government.
[01:48:37.973 --> 01:48:41.414]  You know, people say, oh, well, if they made me shut down my business, I might fight.
[01:48:41.454 --> 01:48:42.195]  Well, here we are.
[01:48:42.335 --> 01:48:43.215]  They shut down our businesses.
[01:48:43.275 --> 01:48:44.796]  If they made me wear a mask, I might fight.
[01:48:44.816 --> 01:48:46.116]  Well, here we are, wearing a mask.
[01:48:46.696 --> 01:48:47.537]  And we're not fighting.
[01:48:47.857 --> 01:48:50.518]  So we're telling them, you know, and silence is consent.
[01:48:51.178 --> 01:48:52.018]  And I'm not silent.
[01:48:52.038 --> 01:48:52.758]  You're not silent.
[01:48:52.998 --> 01:48:54.359]  People like us aren't silent.
[01:48:54.419 --> 01:48:56.139]  But there's very many people that are.
[01:48:56.780 --> 01:49:00.361]  And as long as we're consenting and they see that consent, they're going to continue to move the line.
[01:49:00.601 --> 01:49:04.222]  And people like us will be labeled the terrorists.
[01:49:04.242 --> 01:49:05.963]  We're going to be labeled the fringe, right?
[01:49:07.523 --> 01:49:13.487]  But, you know, Alex, like I said, this doesn't end well for us unless we change course and we change course now.
[01:49:14.067 --> 01:49:25.294]  And right now we have the most important election in the history of our country coming up, where my mother was sitting here in my living room last week and she said, son, this is no longer about Joe Biden versus Donald Trump.
[01:49:25.314 --> 01:49:31.618]  This is literally, in a very real way, a choice between liberty and freedom and tyranny.
[01:49:32.113 --> 01:49:32.673]  And that's it.
[01:49:32.813 --> 01:49:38.695]  And if we choose tyranny this time around, we will never, ever, ever be able to go back to where we want to be.
[01:49:39.115 --> 01:49:40.095]  And you've been through this.
[01:49:40.135 --> 01:49:41.436]  You saw this in Peru.
[01:49:41.796 --> 01:49:42.496]  Your family did.
[01:49:42.536 --> 01:49:45.697]  I mean, the globalists admit this is a total takeover.
[01:49:46.497 --> 01:49:51.918]  Describe to people, with your historical understanding, what it will look like if they win, what the future is.
[01:49:54.319 --> 01:49:57.860]  If they win, it's going to be a free-for-all, Alex.
[01:49:58.420 --> 01:49:59.621]  I'm going to tell you what's going to happen.
[01:49:59.641 --> 01:50:00.821]  If Joe Biden wins,
[01:50:01.537 --> 01:50:10.881]  In November, they're going to absolutely push their agenda in a way that is so fast and so uncontrollable that we will not have a choice.
[01:50:10.901 --> 01:50:13.562]  We won't be able to stop it unless we take to the streets.
[01:50:13.582 --> 01:50:18.704]  And there's going to be bloodshed in the streets because at that point, they know they've won.
[01:50:18.724 --> 01:50:24.307]  And at that point, they're going to be so rooted for the next four to eight years that we will never be able to catch up again.
[01:50:24.327 --> 01:50:29.089]  And like I said before, we won't be able to vote ourselves out of this this time around.
[01:50:29.534 --> 01:50:30.034]  We're good to go.
[01:50:47.603 --> 01:50:55.766]  And now they know if they get in, they're going to go for the, they say, we're going to quote, wipe his supporters out, wipe out Americans, wipe out the middle class.
[01:50:55.786 --> 01:50:59.567]  I mean, they're on TV saying they're going to quote, level us, wipe us out.
[01:50:59.987 --> 01:51:01.167]  Your family experienced that.
[01:51:01.207 --> 01:51:02.428]  What does the wipe out look like?
[01:51:03.752 --> 01:51:05.092]  They're telling us what it's going to look like.
[01:51:05.112 --> 01:51:06.693]  It's going to be like you losing all your wealth.
[01:51:06.993 --> 01:51:13.115]  It's going to be like guys like me going to the bank one day and not having any money in the account because my accounts are frozen and not be able to access them.
[01:51:13.395 --> 01:51:13.635]  You know?
[01:51:14.195 --> 01:51:19.236]  It's going to look like them telling me that I can't run my business because I don't have a vaccine or my kids aren't vaccinated.
[01:51:19.556 --> 01:51:21.737]  It's going to look like my kids not be able to get an education.
[01:51:21.757 --> 01:51:22.317]  And that's the key.
[01:51:22.337 --> 01:51:28.019]  That's the cover for their communism is going to be the Microsoft Bill Gates run contact tracing.
[01:51:28.059 --> 01:51:28.639]  That's their cover.
[01:51:30.772 --> 01:51:32.472]  So we know the playbook, right?
[01:51:32.512 --> 01:51:39.874]  They create an obstacle, they create a problem, then they wait for a reaction, and then they create a solution, right?
[01:51:39.894 --> 01:51:41.294]  But the solution is not a real solution.
[01:51:41.354 --> 01:51:45.135]  The solution is just furthering their own agenda by whatever action they take.
[01:51:45.195 --> 01:51:48.296]  In this case, it's going to be, I think, the inoculation and the contact tracing.
[01:51:48.316 --> 01:51:53.237]  It's going to be a very globalist control over us.
[01:51:55.377 --> 01:51:57.118]  We have nowhere to go from here, Alex.
[01:51:57.238 --> 01:51:57.858]  I can't pack up.
[01:51:57.898 --> 01:51:58.398]  I said this earlier.
[01:51:58.419 --> 01:52:02.060]  I can't pack up my family, sell my things, and go to another country to start over again.
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:02.940]  And there's nowhere to run.
[01:52:03.080 --> 01:52:08.762]  I love America, but I've said if there was some free country, the folks that got it, I would have left because... We would have gone.
[01:52:08.863 --> 01:52:11.464]  We would have gone because I love my freedom more than I love my country.
[01:52:11.504 --> 01:52:13.144]  And I love my country because of my freedom.
[01:52:14.805 --> 01:52:15.465]  Beautifully said.
[01:52:15.525 --> 01:52:16.085]  So, wow.
[01:52:16.105 --> 01:52:17.906]  Sounds like your folks are great people.
[01:52:18.966 --> 01:52:20.107]  Talk about your parents.
[01:52:20.127 --> 01:52:20.847]  They are, you know.
[01:52:22.228 --> 01:52:23.008]  My parents, you know.
[01:52:23.584 --> 01:52:27.046]  I say this all the time, that my parents, we came from very humble beginnings, okay?
[01:52:27.806 --> 01:52:31.468]  My parents' families have done very well in Peru, in Latin America.
[01:52:32.128 --> 01:52:45.634]  In fact, I'll tell you something that I haven't said on any show before, is that my grandfather was an Allende, related to Salvador Allende, who was the communist leader of Chile, and we know what happened to him, you know, in that coup d'etat.
[01:52:46.235 --> 01:52:47.975]  So, that is my family history.
[01:52:48.015 --> 01:52:49.216]  We come from the Allende family.
[01:52:49.256 --> 01:52:51.257]  We come from a socialist, communist family.
[01:52:53.319 --> 01:52:53.519]  I don't
[01:53:11.485 --> 01:53:14.727]  So let me tell you that this does not end well for free people, okay?
[01:53:15.007 --> 01:53:17.629]  So here I am now, a proud American.
[01:53:17.649 --> 01:53:18.289]  I'm an American.
[01:53:18.329 --> 01:53:22.032]  If you ask me, I'm not a Peruvian-American, I'm not a Latin-American, I am a regular American.
[01:53:22.052 --> 01:53:26.314]  Chairman, I can tell, if I ask about your folks, I can tell you know what you're talking about.
[01:53:26.795 --> 01:53:30.617]  Not just from being in the military, being American, but you had some expert understanding.
[01:53:32.058 --> 01:53:33.639]  Yeah, and my parents are great people.
[01:53:33.659 --> 01:53:36.360]  Listen, they lost absolutely everything.
[01:53:36.761 --> 01:53:39.703]  You know, whatever their families had amassed in wealth was completely lost.
[01:53:39.743 --> 01:53:40.383]  It came to this country.
[01:53:41.039 --> 01:53:42.360]  Uh, my father's a preacher.
[01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:43.880]  He's a pastor of a church.
[01:53:43.960 --> 01:53:44.621]  No, I get it.
[01:53:44.641 --> 01:53:48.262]  There's nothing like experience to make you be intelligent and informed.
[01:53:50.823 --> 01:53:52.164]  Absolutely nothing else, you know?
[01:53:52.504 --> 01:53:54.405]  So let me talk about this for one second.
[01:53:54.465 --> 01:54:01.247]  Alex, if you don't mind me jumping out a little bit, what you just said about experience is something that, that you can't replicate.
[01:54:01.427 --> 01:54:04.249]  You have to understand things based on experience, right?
[01:54:04.869 --> 01:54:09.911]  Um, what have we done, you know, to, to, to our society over the last 30 years, I was raised
[01:54:10.812 --> 01:54:14.375]  In a community that told you that if you don't go to college, you're going to end up being a plumber.
[01:54:14.636 --> 01:54:14.876]  Okay?
[01:54:15.096 --> 01:54:19.059]  Well, a plumber makes $150 an hour, and if they own their own business, they make more, right?
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.322]  And people with a college degree, on average, are bagging groceries.
[01:54:22.342 --> 01:54:22.602]  Sorry.
[01:54:22.622 --> 01:54:22.602]  100%.
[01:54:25.065 --> 01:54:27.867]  So I'm going somewhere with this, right, in that we were all funneled
[01:54:28.464 --> 01:54:28.524]  Yes.
[01:54:47.199 --> 01:54:50.463]  To have a vessel, and that vessel was academia, right?
[01:54:50.684 --> 01:54:57.633]  That vessel was universities and colleges around the country, where they could funnel us all in there and get brainwashed, essentially, to where we are now.
[01:54:57.653 --> 01:54:58.854]  And they needed a political army.
[01:55:00.086 --> 01:55:07.295]  You know, and create a political army and allies because they knew that this day would come where they would need every last person, you know?
[01:55:08.176 --> 01:55:18.969]  And they need to give them educations that disenfranchise them so they're desperate and scared and will follow the cult leaders who've already abused them under Stockholm Syndrome to then direct them against the rest of the country.
[01:55:20.971 --> 01:55:25.473]  100%.
[01:55:22.372 --> 01:55:25.473]  It's all conditioning, and I won't even go into all the studies that have been done.
[01:55:25.513 --> 01:55:30.556]  We could go into that another time, but studies of how easily conditioned people are.
[01:55:31.617 --> 01:55:33.377]  Milgram, Stanford, you name it.
[01:55:35.959 --> 01:55:37.580]  Well listen, you need to join us again.
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:39.781]  When do you want to come back on with the show?
[01:55:41.348 --> 01:55:54.539]  You tell me Alex, I love your show, I love what you're doing, and listen, I never wanted this platform, but now that I have a platform, people are hearing this message, I think it's important, and I feel it's my duty now, as part of that oath that we talked about earlier, to get this message out, because we have to save our country.
[01:55:54.559 --> 01:55:59.202]  Yeah, why don't you just pick a day you want to host an hour, that way I'm not interrupting and you can really flow with it.
[01:55:59.483 --> 01:56:00.864]  Dario, the producer, will talk to you.
[01:56:00.884 --> 01:56:02.485]  You pick an hour you want to come on.
[01:56:02.505 --> 01:56:03.506]  No, seriously, that's what we do.
[01:56:03.526 --> 01:56:08.290]  We want to get regular folks who aren't the regular folks, the real people, on the show, in the game, brother.
[01:56:09.406 --> 01:56:09.806]  I appreciate that.
[01:56:09.826 --> 01:56:13.288]  I have a lot to say, and I would love to come back and do that with you.
[01:56:13.649 --> 01:56:16.410]  And you ought to, sometime when you're cold, after you've done it, if he does, bring your dad!
[01:56:16.450 --> 01:56:17.211]  You should do a show with him!
[01:56:17.231 --> 01:56:20.173]  Yeah, he'd probably love it.
[01:56:20.533 --> 01:56:21.413]  He has a lot to say.
[01:56:21.433 --> 01:56:27.237]  I bet he does, because I can tell, not just that you're informed, you have that passion and that focus of the experience.
[01:56:27.257 --> 01:56:27.917]  You can see that.
[01:56:28.218 --> 01:56:29.058]  You can't fake that.
[01:56:30.579 --> 01:56:36.803]  We love this country, Alex, and one thing that I will not buy into is the fact that, based on the color of my skin,
[01:56:37.205 --> 01:56:46.547]  You know, being an Hispanic, that I need to vote a certain way, you know, because there's so many like us, you know, and so many people from my background and in our culture have bought into that bait.
[01:56:46.567 --> 01:56:56.349]  Well, it's not saying there isn't real stuff by all sides out there, but the globalist corporates with their sociology and anthropology are exploiting people, period, cold-bloodedly.
[01:56:56.389 --> 01:56:56.969]  It's a fraud.
[01:56:57.289 --> 01:57:00.630]  Doesn't mean there's not real stuff going on, but what they're doing is a fraud.
[01:57:00.910 --> 01:57:01.750]  Carlos Zapata,
[01:57:02.570 --> 01:57:05.052]  At Carlos underscore Zapata underscore one, a real leader.
[01:57:05.673 --> 01:57:07.434]  Instagram Carlos dot Zapata dot 90.
[01:57:07.614 --> 01:57:10.316]  Hey, come back on this week.
[01:57:10.356 --> 01:57:10.877]  Let's not wait.
[01:57:10.897 --> 01:57:11.857]  Get on with Owen Schroeder.
[01:57:12.378 --> 01:57:14.039]  Daria's gonna set you up right now.
[01:57:14.059 --> 01:57:14.980]  Get on my Instagram.
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:15.660]  Get on Twitter.
[01:57:15.680 --> 01:57:16.861]  I have a lot to say on there, guys.
[01:57:16.941 --> 01:57:17.382]  Follow me.
[01:57:17.662 --> 01:57:18.843]  Not because I want the popularity.
[01:57:18.863 --> 01:57:19.723]  No, but you need to win the war.
[01:57:19.743 --> 01:57:20.704]  I get it, brother.
[01:57:20.744 --> 01:57:21.204]  Here's the deal.
[01:57:21.245 --> 01:57:21.585]  Here's the deal.
[01:57:21.925 --> 01:57:22.746]  Here's the deal.
[01:57:22.826 --> 01:57:23.987]  You're now conscripted.
[01:57:24.007 --> 01:57:25.828]  You're now drafted into the InfoWars Army.
[01:57:25.868 --> 01:57:27.229]  So, come back on this tomorrow.
[01:57:27.249 --> 01:57:27.990]  Come on the other shows.
[01:57:28.430 --> 01:57:29.551]  Tell people where you want them to go again.
[01:57:29.591 --> 01:57:30.492]  Where were you saying?
[01:57:30.512 --> 01:57:30.732]  Instagram?
[01:57:32.395 --> 01:57:38.977]  A lot of you are probably already very familiar with these terms I'm about to introduce, but some folks aren't.
[01:57:39.017 --> 01:57:41.418]  So, for those that aren't, here they are.
[01:57:41.458 --> 01:57:41.938]  Activated charcoal.
[01:58:03.373 --> 01:58:05.952]  And then another term, enamel safe.
[01:58:07.518 --> 01:58:13.441]  Activated charcoal is the fastest growing type of toothpaste for a good reason.
[01:58:14.081 --> 01:58:15.002]  It really, really works.
[01:58:15.042 --> 01:58:29.748]  Well, we've come up with the best activated charcoal toothpaste with no fillers, the cleanest type, the highest quality, with a bunch of high quality essential oils and other ingredients known and documented to do amazing things for your oral hygiene and your overall health and your mouth.
[01:58:29.989 --> 01:58:34.571]  It's so critical and it makes your teeth look really white and really, really clean and it's good for your gums.
[01:58:35.191 --> 01:58:39.033]  But on top of that, it doesn't have any ingredients that are known to hurt enamel.
[01:58:39.773 --> 01:58:44.515]  I've gone out before and gotten toothpaste that really made my teeth clean, but eroded enamel up the top.
[01:58:45.036 --> 01:58:49.598]  So I got into really safe, healthy types of toothpaste, and that's what this is.
[01:58:49.978 --> 01:58:52.099]  It's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:53.180 --> 01:58:56.361]  Supposedly she can rap, too.
[01:58:56.401 --> 01:58:56.681]  Terrific.
[01:58:56.701 --> 01:58:57.641]  These are all terrific.
[01:58:58.001 --> 01:58:59.242]  Meet Bedlam.
[01:58:59.802 --> 01:59:00.482]  Cool name.
[01:59:01.082 --> 01:59:01.743]  Superpowers?
[01:59:02.243 --> 01:59:14.146]  My superpowers, being honest, I've extrapolated this out, and I won't have to for a few years since I got food and stuff, but I'm literally looking at my neighbors now and going, am I ready to hang them up and gut them and skin them and chop them up?
[01:59:14.206 --> 01:59:14.526]  You know what?
[01:59:14.546 --> 01:59:14.906]  I'm ready.
[01:59:15.186 --> 01:59:15.887]  I'll eat my neighbors.
[01:59:16.187 --> 01:59:16.507]  You're in.
[01:59:18.536 --> 01:59:21.117]  Leftist ass like corn on the cob!
[01:59:21.337 --> 01:59:22.258]  I'm ready!
[01:59:22.438 --> 01:59:22.698]  I will!
[01:59:23.278 --> 01:59:24.519]  I will eat your ass!
[01:59:24.899 --> 01:59:25.699]  I'll eat your ass!
[01:59:25.719 --> 01:59:27.060]  My children aren't going hungry!
[01:59:27.200 --> 01:59:27.660]  I'll do it!
[01:59:27.900 --> 01:59:29.000]  I'll drink your blood!
[01:59:29.701 --> 01:59:32.722]  And I'm starting to think about having to eat my neighbors!
[01:59:32.942 --> 01:59:33.902]  You think I like?
[01:59:34.043 --> 01:59:37.124]  Size it up, I'm gonna haul him up by a chain!
[01:59:37.184 --> 01:59:40.685]  Chop his ass up, size it up, I'm gonna haul him up by a chain!
[01:59:40.765 --> 01:59:42.066]  Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop!
[01:59:56.989 --> 02:00:00.924]  If you are receiving this translation, you are the Resistance.
[02:00:22.780 --> 02:00:30.124]  This is the pro-human, pro-God, pro-family, pro-children, pro-future transmission.
[02:00:30.724 --> 02:00:37.168]  We are standing tall in the face of evil and its attempt to take control of the planet forever.
[02:00:37.188 --> 02:00:41.990]  And I'm honored to be here and very thankful you've kept us in this position to fight back.
[02:00:44.172 --> 02:00:45.372]  Who'd I say was up next?
[02:00:47.153 --> 02:00:48.614]  That'd be Mike in Oregon.
[02:00:48.654 --> 02:00:49.695]  Mike, thanks for calling in.
[02:00:49.715 --> 02:00:50.255]  Go ahead, Mike.
[02:00:52.885 --> 02:00:57.150]  Alex, 1984 doesn't have anything on 2020.
[02:00:57.290 --> 02:01:15.409]  We're living in probably the most dystopic times of any human existence and at this point, with the way the city is going, I'm just, I have to get out of here as quickly as possible because these people are so brainwashed and far gone that basically
[02:01:16.860 --> 02:01:22.704]  They'll do anything to destroy Trump at this point, and they don't care if they destroy the city along with it.
[02:01:22.724 --> 02:01:23.304]  They don't care.
[02:01:23.324 --> 02:01:27.127]  They're just like, basically, they'll snitch you out for not wearing a mask.
[02:01:27.687 --> 02:01:32.610]  But we got 70 days of rioting here, and the downtown looks like a third world country.
[02:01:33.671 --> 02:01:42.497]  And basically, if the president's hearing us, we, you know, most of us around here would like to see the National Guard come in and actually take care of this.
[02:01:43.206 --> 02:01:44.767]  Because this is just getting ridiculous.
[02:01:44.887 --> 02:01:51.451]  I know a lot of people that own businesses downtown, really good people, diverse people, black, white, Arabic, it doesn't matter.
[02:01:51.751 --> 02:01:57.814]  And when you read the Washington Post and New York Times, MSNBC, it's like, America's failed.
[02:01:58.194 --> 02:02:00.736]  The rioting caused by Trump and the police.
[02:02:01.116 --> 02:02:02.797]  And it's just a total inversion of reality.
[02:02:04.881 --> 02:02:05.501]  Absolutely.
[02:02:05.541 --> 02:02:15.624]  Your guys' news broadcast will show the actual footage of the guy going around and just the other night he was chased by the protesters.
[02:02:15.644 --> 02:02:17.965]  That's what the local news like to call them, the rioters.
[02:02:18.505 --> 02:02:24.607]  Turned out he was a liberal dude going to help his transgender friend who'd been robbed.
[02:02:24.667 --> 02:02:26.227]  And it turns out there's footage of that happening.
[02:02:27.407 --> 02:02:29.008]  So he's literally a liberal.
[02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:33.491]  Oh yeah, the news said he was part of the Proud Boys.
[02:02:33.511 --> 02:02:37.933]  They didn't even show the crowd robbing his vehicle or none of that.
[02:02:37.953 --> 02:02:38.493]  They're just like...
[02:02:45.017 --> 02:02:47.881]  Downtown protesters got a little out of hand last night.
[02:02:47.901 --> 02:02:49.143]  It's like, a little out of hand?
[02:02:49.543 --> 02:02:51.426]  What's a little out of hand after 70 days?
[02:02:51.486 --> 02:02:59.277]  This is just... And they beat the guy's wife up, drag him out of his car, kick him in the head, and then say, Get up, bitch!
[02:02:59.757 --> 02:03:00.539]  Nothing wrong with you!
[02:03:02.202 --> 02:03:09.944]  Yeah, nothing wrong when a guy comes up with a 10-yard field marker and boots you right in the face like he's going for a field goal.
[02:03:10.444 --> 02:03:14.245]  And by the way, the man they attacked took two days to become conscious again.
[02:03:14.265 --> 02:03:14.905]  He did it yesterday.
[02:03:14.925 --> 02:03:21.307]  They put him in a coma and beat his wife up, but they're the heroes.
[02:03:22.627 --> 02:03:23.128]  For no reason.
[02:03:23.208 --> 02:03:25.268]  Yeah, apparently so.
[02:03:25.308 --> 02:03:31.470]  They got more rights than the majority of the business owners, people who own rent and do anything down there.
[02:03:32.529 --> 02:03:33.350]  You can't do anything.
[02:03:33.691 --> 02:03:36.995]  I usually want to go down there and get a bite to eat, and I won't even go near it.
[02:03:37.195 --> 02:03:40.319]  I live about 10 miles from downtown, and I won't even go near it.
[02:03:40.339 --> 02:03:44.224]  I'm trying to even... Oh, I won't even go to downtown Austin now unless I've got to go down there to protest.
[02:03:44.264 --> 02:03:45.886]  I mean, it's gone.
[02:03:45.946 --> 02:03:48.269]  Feces, needles, satanic liberals stumbling around.
[02:03:48.730 --> 02:03:49.431]  God bless you, brother.
[02:03:49.451 --> 02:03:50.212]  I appreciate your call.
[02:03:50.872 --> 02:03:55.175]  We've got Dr. Mercola joining us for three segments, but then I will continue with your calls if you want to hold.
[02:03:55.195 --> 02:03:59.218]  If not, to Jeff and JB and Michael and Tim and Gus.
[02:03:59.698 --> 02:04:08.224]  I understand, but I will get to all of you before I hand the baton to Paul Joseph Watson, who will be hosting the fourth hour.
[02:04:09.105 --> 02:04:17.731]  But we're going to get into this with Dr. Mercola, who's a medical doctor, very respected, on what's really happening with COVID-19, where he sees all this going.
[02:04:18.991 --> 02:04:32.300]  And the silencing of doctors and other medical professionals who come out and point out that this is a vitamin and nutrient deficiency, that hydroxychloroquine helps put zinc into the cells, that the death rate is very, very low.
[02:04:32.941 --> 02:04:34.122]  But we still have InfoWars.
[02:04:34.142 --> 02:04:35.002]  We still have NewsWars.
[02:04:35.022 --> 02:04:36.263]  We still have Band.Video.
[02:04:36.603 --> 02:04:38.625]  We still have Mercola.com.
[02:04:39.625 --> 02:04:42.668]  So that is coming up, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:04:43.832 --> 02:04:46.518]  On the other side of this quick break, Dr. Joseph Mercola.
[02:04:47.199 --> 02:04:48.081]  Mercola.com.
[02:04:48.562 --> 02:04:49.123]  Please talk about it.
[02:04:49.143 --> 02:04:49.664]  You know, tune in.
[02:04:49.684 --> 02:04:51.488]  This will be very informative.
[02:04:51.849 --> 02:04:54.434]  And then Paul Joseph Watson, The 4th Hour, as I said.
[02:04:54.474 --> 02:04:54.935]  We'll be right back.
[02:05:04.753 --> 02:05:08.195]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[02:05:08.215 --> 02:05:09.355]  They're going to contest the election.
[02:05:09.475 --> 02:05:10.796]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[02:05:10.876 --> 02:05:12.497]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[02:05:12.597 --> 02:05:13.617]  I want them shut down.
[02:05:13.678 --> 02:05:14.578]  I want them silenced.
[02:05:14.638 --> 02:05:15.438]  I want them muted.
[02:05:15.478 --> 02:05:17.259]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:05:17.299 --> 02:05:18.220]  You kept us on air.
[02:05:18.360 --> 02:05:19.641]  We did the analysis first.
[02:05:19.921 --> 02:05:20.941]  It's now gone mainstream.
[02:05:20.981 --> 02:05:22.982]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[02:05:23.062 --> 02:05:29.045]  And what they said directly to us is, you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[02:05:29.185 --> 02:05:30.606]  And you need to stop right now.
[02:05:30.726 --> 02:05:31.787]  And they're very, very serious.
[02:05:31.947 --> 02:05:34.248]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[02:05:34.428 --> 02:05:37.130]  It's not gonna happen, so they are moving now to destroy me.
[02:05:37.611 --> 02:05:40.033]  I used to say support InfoWars, rescue InfoWars.
[02:05:40.133 --> 02:05:41.774]  Save yourself, save the world.
[02:05:42.094 --> 02:05:42.955]  We're in this together.
[02:05:43.075 --> 02:05:51.082]  Because let me tell you something, communism's up here, InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting, and you and I are all down here with our families.
[02:05:51.282 --> 02:05:52.843]  My children are right here!
[02:05:53.564 --> 02:05:55.585]  But I need money to fight a war!
[02:05:55.665 --> 02:05:57.007]  And I need word of mouth!
[02:05:57.067 --> 02:05:58.027]  And I need prayer!
[02:05:58.107 --> 02:05:58.768]  And I need action!
[02:05:59.168 --> 02:06:00.750]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[02:06:01.470 --> 02:06:03.412]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[02:06:06.178 --> 02:06:10.043]  We are transferring power from Washington D.C.
[02:06:10.323 --> 02:06:13.387]  and giving it back to you, the people.
[02:06:17.648 --> 02:06:21.569]  Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo!
[02:06:21.629 --> 02:06:24.010]  This is the heart of 1776.
[02:06:24.170 --> 02:06:29.651]  Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[02:06:29.771 --> 02:06:36.473]  Huge nationwide protests erupted once again on President Donald Trump's second weekend in office.
[02:06:36.633 --> 02:06:38.933]  People, not my bus!
[02:06:39.033 --> 02:06:40.974]  People, not my bus!
[02:06:41.795 --> 02:06:47.919]  When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.
[02:06:47.959 --> 02:06:53.383]  When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.
[02:06:53.443 --> 02:06:57.767]  Donald J. Trump is now President of the United States.
[02:06:57.947 --> 02:07:02.610]  And most importantly, we will be protected by God.
[02:07:02.850 --> 02:07:07.554]  From the front lines of the Info Room, it's Alex Jones.
[02:07:11.417 --> 02:07:12.400]  I'm good.
[02:07:22.279 --> 02:07:34.370]  All right, Dr. Joseph Mercola is undoubtedly the number one alternative independent news source for health news in the last 25-30 years, reaching billions of people.
[02:07:35.411 --> 02:07:36.912]  And now he's heavily censored as well.
[02:07:36.972 --> 02:07:38.794]  Dr. Joseph Mercola is a medical doctor.
[02:07:38.814 --> 02:07:39.574]  I'm not going to go over that.
[02:07:39.895 --> 02:07:41.936]  Best-selling author, osteopathic medicine.
[02:07:43.075 --> 02:07:46.296]  You know, featured in everything you can imagine, Mercola.com.
[02:07:46.757 --> 02:07:57.201]  He's here to break down with us what's really going on from a real medical doctor's perspective and to talk about the unprecedented censorship of hundreds of prominent doctors, scientists.
[02:07:57.762 --> 02:08:01.523]  Cedars-Sinai put out a video saying, yeah, we do use light therapy for this in the lungs.
[02:08:01.923 --> 02:08:03.224]  That got banned off YouTube.
[02:08:04.124 --> 02:08:05.325]  It's just, it's next level.
[02:08:06.125 --> 02:08:08.566]  It's Soviet Union or Communist China level.
[02:08:08.987 --> 02:08:11.008]  Dr. Mercola, thank you so much for joining us.
[02:08:11.048 --> 02:08:11.668]  Great to have you here.
[02:08:12.631 --> 02:08:13.872]  Well, thank you for having me, Alex.
[02:08:13.932 --> 02:08:16.033]  Really appreciate the opportunity to connect again.
[02:08:16.854 --> 02:08:18.435]  Well, where do you want to start?
[02:08:18.715 --> 02:08:19.736]  With the censorship?
[02:08:19.816 --> 02:08:20.737]  With the real numbers?
[02:08:21.037 --> 02:08:23.199]  With the best facts you've got on COVID?
[02:08:23.219 --> 02:08:24.680]  We're really excited to have you here.
[02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:25.440]  You're a great resource.
[02:08:26.741 --> 02:08:28.142]  Well, thanks.
[02:08:28.943 --> 02:08:33.726]  I think probably the biggest thing is that obviously there's a serious problem going on here.
[02:08:33.906 --> 02:08:42.112]  I believe it's been the statistics have been engineered and inflated and really fear has been driven into the population to
[02:08:42.762 --> 02:08:43.622]  Thank you.
[02:09:07.418 --> 02:09:13.103]  Any efforts to explain and educate the public about this have been violently suppressed.
[02:09:14.043 --> 02:09:15.765]  And ours has certainly been one of them.
[02:09:16.085 --> 02:09:35.400]  But in response to that, because I've been passionate about natural therapies to help improve people's health, I learned and appreciated that vitamin D is a simple solution that many people understand, but really fail to appreciate how significantly powerful this resource is.
[02:09:36.275 --> 02:09:49.264]  So, there's loads of evidence that show that if you have sufficient vitamin D's, and Alex, 80% or more of the individuals in this country are vitamin D insufficient.
[02:09:49.905 --> 02:10:02.174]  And those that have very dark colored skin, like African Americans or people from the Middle East,
[02:10:04.599 --> 02:10:04.900]  I think so.
[02:10:12.785 --> 02:10:14.226]  I apologize for that beeping in the background.
[02:10:14.246 --> 02:10:16.969]  We're in a storm right now and my backup power supply is down.
[02:10:16.989 --> 02:10:17.710]  It doesn't bother us.
[02:10:17.730 --> 02:10:18.751]  We totally understand.
[02:10:19.331 --> 02:10:25.076]  Let's talk about that because the worst hit areas, the highest death tolls were these urban canyons.
[02:10:25.597 --> 02:10:31.702]  And we've seen, and it's also African Americans, but also people from areas of darker skin.
[02:10:32.083 --> 02:10:37.508]  And I'm always reading about the fact they also have higher cancer rates because they're unable to get the vitamin D. And again,
[02:10:37.688 --> 02:10:37.928]  Absolutely.
[02:10:37.948 --> 02:10:42.171]  And then the elderly, so the two biggest risk groups are the African-Americans and the elderly.
[02:10:42.271 --> 02:10:43.152]  And the primary
[02:11:07.332 --> 02:11:15.316]  Common denominator in both of those groups is really one of the most important ones is the lack of vitamin D optimized levels.
[02:11:15.436 --> 02:11:16.897]  Well, there's also a cultural thing.
[02:11:17.057 --> 02:11:20.399]  It's going away, and that's good because I think black skin's beautiful, just like all color skins.
[02:11:20.439 --> 02:11:20.779]  I love it.
[02:11:21.359 --> 02:11:22.800]  But really, black skin's healthy.
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:24.861]  A lot of black folks don't want to get a bunch of sun.
[02:11:24.901 --> 02:11:25.782]  They want to be super black.
[02:11:25.822 --> 02:11:26.762]  Well, I'm sorry.
[02:11:27.143 --> 02:11:28.183]  You need to get the sun.
[02:11:28.203 --> 02:11:28.943]  You need to be black.
[02:11:29.844 --> 02:11:31.225]  It's not only black.
[02:11:31.605 --> 02:11:33.526]  It's Mexicans and other
[02:11:36.383 --> 02:11:53.955]  Yeah, so that's unfortunate because it is what we're designed to do and I, you know, I think that's one of the most, the healthiest strategies you can have.
[02:11:53.995 --> 02:11:55.616]  So ideally, that's the best way.
[02:11:55.656 --> 02:11:59.359]  But even if you live in these areas, in subtropical areas in the Middle East or Africa,
[02:12:01.147 --> 02:12:02.268]  Or Dubai.
[02:12:02.648 --> 02:12:04.289]  You have to go out in the sun.
[02:12:04.470 --> 02:12:06.751]  Just because you live in a place where you have it, it doesn't make a difference.
[02:12:06.891 --> 02:12:11.635]  So, many of us, even if we live in places where we can get sun exposure, we're not going out.
[02:12:11.675 --> 02:12:14.637]  We're working, although many of us nowadays aren't working because of the sun.
[02:12:14.657 --> 02:12:15.638]  Well, what is it about the sun?
[02:12:15.678 --> 02:12:21.082]  I could be depressed and go out and get 30 minutes of direct sun, you know, in my Speedos in the backyard and just feel totally energized.
[02:12:21.122 --> 02:12:24.024]  I know the eyes pick it up and there's something chemically in the brain, the skin.
[02:12:24.264 --> 02:12:25.505]  What's happening, Dr. Mercola?
[02:12:26.397 --> 02:12:39.786]  Well, there's a large number of benefits, but with respect to the risk for COVID, the primary one is the ultraviolet B radiation, which goes into the skin and increases the production of vitamin D. But then there's other benefits, too.
[02:12:39.826 --> 02:12:52.715]  It has near-infrared and far-infrared rays, which go in and can actually increase the production of nitric oxide, which is very beneficial for control of high blood pressure and regulating the size of your blood vessels.
[02:12:54.019 --> 02:13:02.921]  And of course, the circadian rhythm benefits, which is so key to improving your sleep and staying healthy.
[02:13:05.101 --> 02:13:08.282]  Ideally, you get it from sunlight, but it's possible to take it as a supplement.
[02:13:08.682 --> 02:13:12.042]  Fortunately, vitamin D is one of the least expensive supplements known to man.
[02:13:12.102 --> 02:13:15.683]  It's almost free, so it is not an expensive solution.
[02:13:17.123 --> 02:13:20.624]  In an effort to help educate people, I put together a site.
[02:13:20.704 --> 02:13:21.584]  It's called Stop
[02:13:21.971 --> 02:13:23.832]  StopCovidCold.com.
[02:13:23.892 --> 02:13:24.812]  Pretty easy to spell.
[02:13:24.852 --> 02:13:25.812]  StopCovidCold.com.
[02:13:25.893 --> 02:13:28.193]  And I should have said up front, you're here with solutions.
[02:13:28.574 --> 02:13:38.017]  If everybody simply spreads the word about D, which the media, have you noticed they're fighting to like, they're even taking YouTube videos down from medical doctors to talk about vitamin D and zinc.
[02:13:38.057 --> 02:13:38.637]  This is evil.
[02:13:39.638 --> 02:13:48.361]  The censorship has been accelerated to levels that we had no idea that they would go to this level, but they have.
[02:13:49.162 --> 02:13:49.942]  So you can't even,
[02:13:51.106 --> 02:13:52.067]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:14:10.305 --> 02:14:16.870]  That will identify the most important variables and tell you precisely what your risk factor for developing COVID is.
[02:14:17.070 --> 02:14:19.592]  So let's say that again very slowly for radio listeners.
[02:14:19.652 --> 02:14:20.833]  We've got it on screen for TV viewers.
[02:14:21.293 --> 02:14:22.033]  Tell people to stop.
[02:14:23.174 --> 02:14:23.595]  Stop.
[02:14:24.355 --> 02:14:25.156]  It's the word stop.
[02:14:25.356 --> 02:14:25.816]  COVID.
[02:14:25.956 --> 02:14:26.877]  C-O-V-I-D.
[02:14:27.237 --> 02:14:27.677]  Cold.
[02:14:28.058 --> 02:14:29.299]  C-O-L-D dot com.
[02:14:29.359 --> 02:14:31.080]  Stop COVID cold dot com.
[02:14:31.480 --> 02:14:33.141]  And then send it to all your friends and relatives.
[02:14:33.161 --> 02:14:33.922]  We've also got
[02:14:34.417 --> 02:14:43.572]  The Facebook frame that if you're still on social media and use Facebook, you could overlay this image so it'll help people understand where they can go to get more information.
[02:14:44.427 --> 02:14:50.173]  And there's a PDF that you can download, a short one that's about 12 pages that helps explain it.
[02:14:50.233 --> 02:14:55.839]  It's real easy to understand and gives you precise instructions on how much vitamin D you need and the strategies to use it.
[02:14:56.179 --> 02:15:01.985]  And then a more comprehensive one, like a 50-page report for the healthcare professionals who are interested in specific science.
[02:15:02.025 --> 02:15:03.426]  And that's the number show.
[02:15:04.067 --> 02:15:07.090]  It's urban canyons, black people particularly, not getting any sun.
[02:15:07.130 --> 02:15:07.791]  It's a death sentence.
[02:15:09.309 --> 02:15:17.612]  But as you said, Hispanics, anybody that supposedly, if you have dark skin in the sun, you particularly need to get more sun, right?
[02:15:18.792 --> 02:15:19.092]  Yes.
[02:15:19.212 --> 02:15:19.592]  Yeah.
[02:15:19.612 --> 02:15:20.933]  So that is one factor.
[02:15:20.993 --> 02:15:23.093]  Obviously, there's a wide variety of factors.
[02:15:23.173 --> 02:15:23.833]  Age is one.
[02:15:25.094 --> 02:15:31.916]  And other comorbidities that basically the weight that you have and diabetes.
[02:15:32.403 --> 02:15:38.047]  But the common thread between the comorbidities seems to be a characteristic called insulin resistance.
[02:15:38.087 --> 02:15:43.851]  That is, your body is losing the ability to flexibly transition between using sugar and fat as a primary fuel.
[02:15:44.371 --> 02:15:49.415]  So there are simple, simple strategies that you can do to improve your insulin resistance.
[02:15:49.435 --> 02:15:56.780]  Because if you have high insulin resistance and low vitamin D, you are ticking time bomb when you expose to this virus.
[02:15:56.820 --> 02:15:59.722]  Let's explain that when we come back with Dr. Mercola.
[02:15:59.742 --> 02:16:00.182]  Stay with us.
[02:16:00.262 --> 02:16:00.863]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:16:03.097 --> 02:16:05.318]  It's InfoWars Jr.!
[02:16:06.998 --> 02:16:10.159]  With shows like Jeffrey Epstein Island.
[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:14.360]  Hey kids, I'm Bill Clinton.
[02:16:16.921 --> 02:16:17.982]  And cartoons.
[02:16:18.262 --> 02:16:23.263]  They've got a swamp right under the sea.
[02:16:23.303 --> 02:16:23.583]  Find it!
[02:16:23.623 --> 02:16:24.343]  Grab it!
[02:16:26.224 --> 02:16:28.445]  Who snips your aunt's hat and won't let her flee?
[02:16:28.525 --> 02:16:28.945]  Find it!
[02:16:30.231 --> 02:16:32.272]  Who touches your mom and gropes all the kids?
[02:16:34.253 --> 02:16:43.397]  Be sure not to tell your dad what I did!
[02:16:43.477 --> 02:16:45.578]  Horny!
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:51.520]  End slime time.
[02:16:52.621 --> 02:16:56.503]  It's time to... Slime George Soros!
[02:16:57.463 --> 02:16:59.064]  Dump that slime!
[02:17:01.952 --> 02:17:03.814]  Soros burns!
[02:17:04.254 --> 02:17:05.635]  That's vitamin slime.
[02:17:05.695 --> 02:17:11.020]  Good for ya.
[02:17:12.301 --> 02:17:15.563]  Thanks to you kids, we now know the virus is a hoax.
[02:17:15.683 --> 02:17:20.107]  They included flu, pneumonia, and other infections to boost the numbers.
[02:17:20.147 --> 02:17:21.788]  Let's find out who is really behind it all.
[02:17:21.808 --> 02:17:25.331]  Like, President Trump is definitely behind one of these phantoms.
[02:17:28.554 --> 02:17:29.174]  Gigi P?
[02:17:31.089 --> 02:17:32.174]  Dr. Fauci?
[02:17:32.234 --> 02:17:35.630]  Like I thought doctors were supposed to help people, not scare them!
[02:17:37.136 --> 02:17:38.777]  Microsoft's Bill Gates?
[02:17:38.997 --> 02:17:45.102]  Not only a computer guy, he's a notorious vaccine pusher who wants to reduce the world's population.
[02:17:45.462 --> 02:17:45.983]  I get it.
[02:17:46.103 --> 02:17:51.427]  So Bill Gates wanted to vaccinate everyone after Fauci convinced them there was a deadly disease outbreak.
[02:17:51.507 --> 02:17:52.548]  That's diabolical.
[02:17:52.668 --> 02:17:54.409]  Yeah, that sounds pretty bad.
[02:17:54.509 --> 02:17:55.510]  Don't worry, kids.
[02:17:55.850 --> 02:17:59.132]  These globalists won't get away with their pandemic hoax this time.
[02:17:59.293 --> 02:18:03.516]  Where they're going, they'll be locked up for a long good while in the big house.
[02:18:03.976 --> 02:18:04.836]  Yeah!
[02:18:04.996 --> 02:18:07.657]  Better than a rock round at home!
[02:18:09.358 --> 02:18:10.458]  My name's Joe Biden.
[02:18:10.538 --> 02:18:11.879]  I'm a Democratic candidate.
[02:18:13.039 --> 02:18:17.461]  And if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, you ain't black.
[02:18:17.941 --> 02:18:19.802]  We all may choose to be self-evident.
[02:18:20.742 --> 02:18:24.543]  All men are created by the goal you know the thing.
[02:18:25.584 --> 02:18:28.485]  Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.
[02:18:53.581 --> 02:18:54.682]  This is their plan, people.
[02:18:54.722 --> 02:18:56.103]  These are demons.
[02:18:57.344 --> 02:19:02.187]  Just like the Bible says, it's basically an intergalactic invasion into this space through people.
[02:19:02.828 --> 02:19:06.551]  I'm telling you, it's what all the ancients said, it's what they warned of, it's what we're dealing with.
[02:19:07.031 --> 02:19:09.213]  They're frickin' interdimensional invaders, okay?
[02:19:10.554 --> 02:19:11.594]  I hate this channel.
[02:19:11.755 --> 02:19:12.055]  No!
[02:19:12.215 --> 02:19:12.635]  No!
[02:19:13.776 --> 02:19:14.437]  What is that?
[02:19:14.797 --> 02:19:15.497]  What is that?
[02:19:15.737 --> 02:19:18.179]  InfoWars.
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:20.741]  InfoWars Jr.
[02:19:21.061 --> 02:19:22.402]  InfoWars Jr.
[02:19:24.619 --> 02:19:25.352]  I'm kind of retarded.
[02:19:28.134 --> 02:19:29.275]  Hello, Americans!
[02:19:29.315 --> 02:19:34.558]  You've been asking how you should behave at work and university.
[02:19:34.899 --> 02:19:38.021]  Hollywood has been teaching you how to behave.
[02:19:38.321 --> 02:19:42.804]  But I wanted to introduce to you the perfect new American.
[02:19:43.104 --> 02:19:47.687]  They do not believe in free speech, and they do what they're told at a party.
[02:19:47.827 --> 02:19:53.271]  And most importantly, they report other people and have them censored, and they get in trouble.
[02:19:53.691 --> 02:19:55.552]  This is the new American.
[02:19:55.612 --> 02:19:56.773]  Here you are!
[02:19:56.953 --> 02:19:57.874]  Orange man, man!
[02:20:05.363 --> 02:20:11.250]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:17.043 --> 02:20:17.764]  Big Brother.
[02:20:18.764 --> 02:20:20.005]  Mainstream media.
[02:20:21.086 --> 02:20:22.207]  Government cover-ups.
[02:20:22.867 --> 02:20:24.328]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:20:24.929 --> 02:20:26.250]  Well, so does he.
[02:20:27.090 --> 02:20:31.813]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:32.734 --> 02:20:34.635]  Well, Texas has a new governor.
[02:20:34.655 --> 02:20:37.037]  His name is Greg Abbott.
[02:20:38.878 --> 02:20:39.879]  But he's the same old governor.
[02:20:39.939 --> 02:20:42.581]  He might as well be Gavin Newsom.
[02:20:43.919 --> 02:20:45.520]  Stories up on Infowars.com.
[02:20:45.600 --> 02:20:48.283]  Governor Abbott tells Texans wear a mask around family.
[02:20:50.064 --> 02:20:52.606]  Even your backyard until COVID-19 vaccine.
[02:20:52.987 --> 02:20:55.729]  He's definitely on the payroll of Bill Gates in the UN, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:20:56.730 --> 02:20:58.111]  The mask and studies do nothing.
[02:20:59.172 --> 02:21:01.454]  They cause all sorts of problems with lower oxygen.
[02:21:02.394 --> 02:21:06.178]  It's just absolutely fraudulent and I'm really ashamed of him.
[02:21:07.335 --> 02:21:09.075]  But that's what the line he's towing.
[02:21:09.495 --> 02:21:11.616]  Dr. Mercola is our guest.
[02:21:12.356 --> 02:21:18.397]  I appreciate Dr. Joseph Mercola of Mercola.com joining us, medical doctor, esteemed, very famous, very well respected.
[02:21:18.737 --> 02:21:27.259]  I know you're just trying to get solutions, get vitamin D out to folks so that the death numbers aren't there, but they're going to count people that die of flu and of pneumonia, which I know vitamin D helps as well.
[02:21:27.959 --> 02:21:31.379]  They're not going to stop regardless with this.
[02:21:31.399 --> 02:21:33.560]  Now they say they're never going to end the lockdown.
[02:21:33.880 --> 02:21:34.740]  Big picture for you.
[02:21:35.640 --> 02:21:41.262]  Looking at this, big power grab, the UN is who tells us what can be done, what can't be done.
[02:21:41.282 --> 02:21:45.183]  I mean, big picture, what do you think this whole COVID hysteria is really about?
[02:21:45.203 --> 02:21:46.044]  What do you think of Bill Gates?
[02:21:48.784 --> 02:21:51.485]  I'm sorry, Alex, I just got back in five seconds ago.
[02:21:51.565 --> 02:21:54.666]  I'm saying, what do you think of Bill Gates driving this whole situation?
[02:21:54.686 --> 02:21:56.747]  What do you think about the big picture of what's behind it?
[02:21:58.168 --> 02:21:59.828]  I think that's clearly an element.
[02:21:59.848 --> 02:22:02.129]  We've done a lot of exposés on him.
[02:22:02.169 --> 02:22:04.970]  He's clearly the mastermind at this.
[02:22:05.575 --> 02:22:19.165]  He's part of this broader system called technocracy, which is essentially this small group of people that are focused on technical and engineering solutions to control the whole entire population without any government.
[02:22:19.626 --> 02:22:25.670]  So he's one of the leaders in this mess, for nefarious purposes.
[02:22:25.730 --> 02:22:33.536]  I mean, he follows a path very similar to John Rockefeller, who was equally vilified over 100 years ago.
[02:22:34.753 --> 02:22:34.893]  Exactly.
[02:22:34.913 --> 02:22:36.114]  He operates tax-free.
[02:23:04.631 --> 02:23:05.371]  Essentially, yeah.
[02:23:05.411 --> 02:23:08.352]  He's manipulated the system crazily to his benefit.
[02:23:08.372 --> 02:23:11.554]  So he continues to be one of the wealthiest guys in the world.
[02:23:11.574 --> 02:23:13.654]  So Dr. Joseph Mercola, you're very respected.
[02:23:13.694 --> 02:23:14.535]  Start over with that.
[02:23:14.855 --> 02:23:16.515]  You're saying he is a mastermind.
[02:23:16.736 --> 02:23:20.437]  And you turn on the news, he's like our father, our president, our doctor.
[02:23:20.657 --> 02:23:22.378]  He's saying every facet of our lives.
[02:23:22.638 --> 02:23:24.078]  He tells us when we can go back to work.
[02:23:24.398 --> 02:23:25.879]  He tells us what vaccines we're going to take.
[02:23:26.099 --> 02:23:28.300]  I mean, when did I wake up and this guy's like, my God.
[02:23:29.619 --> 02:23:31.861]  Well, see, I want to get back to the vitamin D, though.
[02:23:31.881 --> 02:23:33.423]  See, that's the whole strategy.
[02:23:33.463 --> 02:23:34.484]  They've got lockdowns.
[02:23:34.725 --> 02:23:36.807]  They've got the mask and they've got the vaccines.
[02:23:36.827 --> 02:23:39.109]  And they also have these other drugs like Remdesivir.
[02:23:39.510 --> 02:23:50.582]  And they just these other strategies like hydroxychloroquine or flacquinil, which is, you know, been basically dismissed by the national media because it's a competitor
[02:23:51.141 --> 02:23:56.702]  To those other strategies and the expensive drugs like remdesivir, which cost three or four thousand dollars for a course of treatment.
[02:23:57.163 --> 02:24:02.164]  But many people aren't aware of this, especially if they've been following natural medicine really carefully.
[02:24:02.184 --> 02:24:04.525]  But there is hydroxychloroquine, I believe in.
[02:24:04.645 --> 02:24:12.907]  It doesn't work as well as some other strategies that I can discuss, but it works by driving zinc into the cell and it needs to be used with zinc early on in the course of illness.
[02:24:12.927 --> 02:24:18.968]  But there's another alternative called quercetin.
[02:24:19.369 --> 02:24:20.949]  It's a natural bioflavonoid.
[02:24:21.437 --> 02:24:28.780]  It's in fruits and vegetables, and you can take it as a high-dose supplement, and it works better, better than hydroxychloroquine.
[02:24:28.920 --> 02:24:31.020]  It's almost free, even compared to that.
[02:24:31.080 --> 02:24:33.281]  How's Corsican do that, Dr. Mercola?
[02:24:34.301 --> 02:24:35.342]  A number of different ways.
[02:24:35.422 --> 02:24:47.686]  It drives zinc into the cell, just like hydroxychloroquine, but it also has other metabolic benefits, because we know that increasing inflammation is one of the reasons that causes the morbidity, mortality increases in COVID.
[02:24:48.126 --> 02:24:50.067]  So, it decreases inflammation.
[02:24:50.087 --> 02:24:50.747]  It does it by
[02:24:51.499 --> 02:24:51.939]  Thank you!
[02:25:15.649 --> 02:25:18.011]  So, along those lines... How is COVID-19 killing us?
[02:25:18.132 --> 02:25:22.056]  Is it plastically destroying cells and replication, or is it the autoimmune response?
[02:25:22.336 --> 02:25:26.320]  Is that why so many doctors are pointing out that steroids inhaled are also knocking it out?
[02:25:28.082 --> 02:25:37.892]  No, it has to do with inflammation, and then a whole variety of metabolic consequences down there, specifically at certain areas of the body, like in the lungs, the alveoli, the little...
[02:25:38.613 --> 02:25:41.975]  Oh, she showed the video of the charts when the people didn't have COVID.
[02:25:42.015 --> 02:25:44.776]  They still would put a tube down their throat and blow their lungs out.
[02:26:08.698 --> 02:26:14.203]  I didn't know, but she just volunteered out of the goodness of her heart to go there and had no idea what she was going to find.
[02:26:14.223 --> 02:26:17.586]  And then once she was there, literally within hours, she realized what a catastrophe it was.
[02:26:17.606 --> 02:26:20.929]  And she went out, talked to a lawyer, and she got spy glasses.
[02:26:20.949 --> 02:26:23.011]  And she recorded these with spy glasses on.
[02:26:23.331 --> 02:26:29.317]  And that's what we need, is the morality of when you see evil, you stand up against it.
[02:26:30.236 --> 02:26:37.022]  Yeah, she's a brave, courageous nurse, and she just wrote a book, The Epistemic Nurse, so it just was released yesterday on Amazon.
[02:26:37.403 --> 02:26:41.666]  But one of the other things, for those of us who try to share this information, we are heavily censored.
[02:26:41.987 --> 02:26:45.210]  Like, I don't even think Twitter has stopped your links.
[02:26:45.690 --> 02:26:48.793]  If you put a link to InfoWars, it still goes up on Twitter, right?
[02:26:48.813 --> 02:26:50.454]  So are you still active on that?
[02:26:51.375 --> 02:26:54.138]  But they haven't taken your links down, I don't think they have.
[02:26:54.178 --> 02:26:56.420]  They're trying to block our BandOn video links, but yes.
[02:26:57.674 --> 02:26:59.314]  They blocked our site.
[02:26:59.394 --> 02:27:05.596]  We had done no violations at all, no rules yet.
[02:27:05.916 --> 02:27:08.897]  You cannot post a link to our site on Twitter.
[02:27:08.937 --> 02:27:10.357]  We're banned from Twitter, essentially.
[02:27:10.637 --> 02:27:15.558]  And that's because they're scared of another well-known, reputable medical doctor.
[02:27:15.578 --> 02:27:22.060]  Again, the level of trying to deny people care, or their own research, or their own consumer research, is just flabbergasting.
[02:27:23.260 --> 02:27:26.421]  Yeah, and aside from censoring, they have discrediting campaigns.
[02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:33.882]  So one of the campaigns is being launched by an associate of Bill Gates, which is CSPI.
[02:27:33.902 --> 02:27:36.803]  It's an acronym for Center for Science and the Public Interest.
[02:27:36.843 --> 02:27:39.103]  Now, this is a nefarious evil group.
[02:27:39.543 --> 02:27:40.824]  They've been around for decades.
[02:27:40.884 --> 02:27:50.346]  And this is a group that was responsible for helping promote trans fat that literally killed millions, if not tens of millions of Americans.
[02:27:50.946 --> 02:27:51.086]  Yeah.
[02:27:51.146 --> 02:27:53.367]  And then they hid the fact up that they did that.
[02:27:54.108 --> 02:27:55.909]  They were promoting artificial sweeteners.
[02:27:55.929 --> 02:27:57.070]  They're just bad.
[02:27:57.130 --> 02:28:01.133]  So anyway, the head of the CSPI is Peter Lorre.
[02:28:01.153 --> 02:28:03.515]  He's a former associate commissioner of the FDA.
[02:28:03.915 --> 02:28:13.101]  And last week, they testified before a subcommittee of the Senate and said that I was a COVID scammer selling snake oil cures.
[02:28:13.701 --> 02:28:16.103]  And they're trying to get the FTC and the FDA coming down my back.
[02:28:16.964 --> 02:28:20.326]  But they can try, but we do nothing illegal.
[02:28:20.366 --> 02:28:21.767]  We don't make any claims.
[02:28:21.847 --> 02:28:23.188]  We have all this vetted by
[02:28:23.717 --> 02:28:27.298]  High-level legal firms to make sure we're not violating any rules.
[02:28:27.318 --> 02:28:28.758]  So there's not much they can do.
[02:28:28.898 --> 02:28:29.238]  No, I know.
[02:28:29.258 --> 02:28:31.138]  They lied about me and said that I had a COVID cure.
[02:28:31.158 --> 02:28:31.898]  I never said that.
[02:28:32.299 --> 02:28:34.919]  But Leticia James of New York said it, and it put me under investigation.
[02:28:35.139 --> 02:28:42.240]  Let's come back and talk about these sinister groups that, again, are trying to suppress the health rights of the American people.
[02:28:42.260 --> 02:28:46.601]  With Dr. Joseph Mercola, I'm Alex Jones with NewsWars.com and InfoWars.com.
[02:28:46.941 --> 02:28:49.041]  And the bad with somebody doing a good job is they're banned.
[02:28:49.362 --> 02:28:51.602]  Well, you can still hand-share Mercola.com.
[02:28:52.122 --> 02:28:58.686]  And we're like, the world is going to end in 12 years if we don't address climate change.
[02:28:58.706 --> 02:29:06.632]  That was two years ago that AOC and Beto O'Rourke told you that the world was ending in 12 years because of climate change.
[02:29:06.652 --> 02:29:07.852]  Well, what is climate change?
[02:29:19.680 --> 02:29:36.705]  It's the cover for them to carry out the shutdown of the world economy and a vertical integration, as they call it, a consolidation of all the money and the power and the resources so they can control the planet to protect it from the overpopulation and then cause mass starvation.
[02:29:37.445 --> 02:29:41.426]  And so when she's saying, hey, the world won't be here, humans won't be here in 12 years,
[02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:44.840]  She's being told that by higher-ups.
[02:29:45.340 --> 02:30:00.924]  She's believing them because they're going to institute global bioweapon releases and economic collapses and famines that will cause the depopulation that the UN and the Club of Rome and the United Nations have been calling for.
[02:30:01.204 --> 02:30:06.765]  That's why they're now bragging that COVID-19 is going to save the earth, it's going to depopulate things, it's going to lower the carbon footprint.
[02:30:08.487 --> 02:30:12.249]  So the so-called guardians of the earth are the ones with the genetic engineering.
[02:30:12.269 --> 02:30:19.532]  They're the ones creating the cross-species chimera, animals and plants and insects and bacteria and viruses.
[02:30:19.572 --> 02:30:24.654]  They're the ones that say they're building a post-human world and a post-carbon world.
[02:30:25.134 --> 02:30:26.855]  So let's look at some of these headlines.
[02:30:27.335 --> 02:30:28.916]  Buy lots of food and store it.
[02:30:29.776 --> 02:30:33.659]  In safe places, because very difficult times are approaching.
[02:30:34.300 --> 02:30:44.208]  And I've got the mass exodus out of blue cities and blue states and leftist areas around the world and COVID-19 causing food shortages and massive food cost spikes.
[02:30:44.768 --> 02:30:46.850]  Why is all this happening?
[02:30:47.370 --> 02:30:48.531]  The headlines are all the same.
[02:30:48.891 --> 02:30:50.613]  How COVID is affecting U.S.
[02:30:50.633 --> 02:30:51.253]  food supply.
[02:30:51.333 --> 02:30:52.714]  No, the lockdown.
[02:30:53.655 --> 02:30:55.917]  The hysteria is causing
[02:30:57.881 --> 02:30:58.662]  The lack of food.
[02:30:58.762 --> 02:31:00.705]  It's causing the breakdown in civilization.
[02:31:01.647 --> 02:31:11.421]  It's called the Great Reset by the Davos Group last year and this year saying they would use a virus to cause an economic collapse.
[02:31:12.406 --> 02:31:13.347]  And they didn't think of this.
[02:31:13.527 --> 02:31:17.050]  The Rockefeller Foundation 10 years ago in lockstep came out and said it.
[02:31:17.090 --> 02:31:18.492]  And Bill Gates last year in event 201.
[02:31:18.532 --> 02:31:24.537]  So I'm here to tell you, they're the ones causing the end of civilization for the general public.
[02:31:24.777 --> 02:31:26.399]  They're the ones causing the collapse.
[02:31:26.439 --> 02:31:28.380]  This is 21st century warfare.
[02:31:28.981 --> 02:31:29.802]  I'm going to tell you again.
[02:31:31.266 --> 02:31:33.467]  You need to warn everybody you know about who's behind this.
[02:31:33.527 --> 02:31:36.008]  You need to share these articles and videos into your own research.
[02:31:36.709 --> 02:31:38.589]  And you need to personally get prepared.
[02:31:39.390 --> 02:31:48.694]  Once the food chain, the supply chain, really breaks down, which has already happened in the third world, the UN admits millions are starving to death a month, hundreds of millions are in danger.
[02:31:49.595 --> 02:31:58.479]  Once it breaks down, the third world, and that food chain collapses, that supply chain, it will cause devastation and starvation here and separately.
[02:31:59.119 --> 02:32:00.399]  I would tell you, get prepared.
[02:32:00.459 --> 02:32:01.680]  Get high quality, storable food.
[02:32:02.020 --> 02:32:03.040]  Get water filtration.
[02:32:03.360 --> 02:32:11.062]  And we have those areas covered with the highest quality water filtration, highest rated, at very affordable low prices, with gravity-fed portable filters.
[02:32:11.362 --> 02:32:20.785]  Ready for your house, RV, home, campsite, with the Alexa Pure, and of course, the Pro-Pure systems that are both comparable, made by other manufacturers that are excellent here in the United States.
[02:32:21.345 --> 02:32:21.565]  I don't
[02:32:37.523 --> 02:32:51.234]  Or whether Trump loses, the globalists have said they're going ahead with the collapse of civilization worldwide, and the collapse of the third world, and the replacement migration after they've dominated and exploited the third world against the first world.
[02:32:51.494 --> 02:33:02.903]  This is sophisticated, it's evil, it's ruthless, but if we face the facts and if we become prepared and self-sufficient, we can weather the storm and be leaders into the future to say no to this system.
[02:33:05.123 --> 02:33:11.068]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.699 --> 02:33:28.482]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:47.068 --> 02:33:50.010]  The Answer, by David Icke, his newest book.
[02:33:50.811 --> 02:33:56.515]  Coming out today, we live in extraordinary times with billions of bewildered and seeking answers for what is happening.
[02:33:56.535 --> 02:34:02.120]  David Icke, the man who has been proven right again and again, has spent 30 years uncovering the truth behind world affairs.
[02:34:03.561 --> 02:34:07.564]  In a stream of previous books, he predicted current events down to a tee.
[02:34:08.265 --> 02:34:12.348]  The Answer will change your every perception of life and the world set up
[02:34:13.649 --> 02:34:16.830]  And set you free from the illusions that control human society.
[02:34:16.870 --> 02:34:23.293]  There's nothing more vital for our collective freedom than humanity becoming aware of what is in this book.
[02:34:23.793 --> 02:34:25.774]  And I haven't read all the book.
[02:34:25.934 --> 02:34:27.435]  I've seen the graphic novel of it.
[02:34:27.775 --> 02:34:29.376]  We'll play some of that while he's on with us.
[02:34:29.416 --> 02:34:30.216]  I do intend to read it.
[02:34:30.836 --> 02:34:31.897]  And it's at DavidIke.com.
[02:34:31.917 --> 02:34:33.037]  But let me just say something right now.
[02:34:34.318 --> 02:34:41.721]  David Ike has been profound in his analysis and his piercing
[02:34:42.836 --> 02:34:46.597]  Understanding of what's currently happening and what's going to be happening.
[02:34:48.318 --> 02:34:51.518]  And InfoWars has also been on the cutting edge of a lot of things.
[02:34:51.538 --> 02:34:53.359]  And it's not about celebrating that.
[02:34:55.960 --> 02:35:00.801]  But it's understanding the fact that we could predict it means we can also stop it.
[02:35:01.974 --> 02:35:08.818]  But it's humanity facing the horror of just how evil these forces are that will set us free.
[02:35:08.858 --> 02:35:17.204]  As long as we live in denial about it, and don't face all the different compartmentalizations that come together to form this behemoth, we have no chance of beating it.
[02:35:18.465 --> 02:35:20.926]  So David was just asking what I wanted him on about.
[02:35:20.946 --> 02:35:22.427]  I've been wanting him on for a month.
[02:35:22.447 --> 02:35:23.608]  He said, I'll come out when the book comes out.
[02:35:23.648 --> 02:35:24.609]  I want him on about the book.
[02:35:25.560 --> 02:35:27.641]  I want him on about what he sees as coming next.
[02:35:27.761 --> 02:35:30.121]  I want him on about how he thinks we stop this.
[02:35:30.501 --> 02:35:33.382]  I want to get his take on how you think the fight's going.
[02:35:33.442 --> 02:35:35.183]  Bill Gates is this reviled demon.
[02:35:35.723 --> 02:35:40.844]  Almost everyone I know, black, white, old, young, liberal, conservative, understands COVID's a hoax.
[02:35:42.205 --> 02:35:43.045]  It's now out in the open.
[02:35:43.065 --> 02:35:44.526]  They want forced microchipping.
[02:35:45.066 --> 02:35:49.067]  Major universities from Europe to the United States are saying this semester, starting
[02:35:49.915 --> 02:35:51.475]  You're going to have a cell phone with an app on it.
[02:35:51.755 --> 02:35:53.756]  You can't leave the grounds for the semester.
[02:35:54.176 --> 02:35:55.216]  If you do, you're expelled.
[02:35:55.596 --> 02:35:57.377]  Only certain shops will take your money.
[02:35:57.397 --> 02:35:59.397]  I mean, it's here.
[02:35:59.557 --> 02:36:01.958]  Everything they built has now been launched.
[02:36:01.998 --> 02:36:06.579]  It's like Hitler built up for World War II for five years, but one day he finally launched the war.
[02:36:07.199 --> 02:36:09.659]  And so the dam has broken, the enemy has emerged.
[02:36:10.019 --> 02:36:12.520]  As David said a few months ago on the show, they've gone from denying it
[02:36:13.300 --> 02:36:13.860]  Yeah, ditto, Alex.
[02:36:13.920 --> 02:36:18.281]  And you know, the fact that this situation could be predicted tells people something very profound.
[02:36:42.174 --> 02:36:49.176]  Those that have been in denial all these decades where they've said to me a few people can't control the world.
[02:36:49.476 --> 02:36:50.397]  It's not possible.
[02:36:50.457 --> 02:36:52.457]  Well, you've just seen it happen in a few months.
[02:36:53.338 --> 02:36:59.740]  And what the predictability of current events tells you is they're not random.
[02:37:00.520 --> 02:37:02.500]  You can't predict random events.
[02:37:02.600 --> 02:37:03.421]  They just happen.
[02:37:04.021 --> 02:37:10.443]  What you can do is predict long-planned events because they are long-planned to happen.
[02:37:11.477 --> 02:37:38.799]  And so we are now looking at a transformation of human society, which surely even the most naive cannot go on believing that this has happened in terms of its organisation and its orchestration since some virus came to light in the early part of this year in the West.
[02:37:40.057 --> 02:37:54.403]  This is playing out as a script, as a seamless script, based on psychological manipulation, not health, because it was sitting there waiting for the button to be pressed for a long, long time before.
[02:37:54.483 --> 02:37:59.805]  And all it was waiting for was the trigger, the excuse to play it out.
[02:38:00.065 --> 02:38:02.566]  And that is what we've seen.
[02:38:03.386 --> 02:38:08.788]  And, you know, when you look at the speed of transformation,
[02:38:09.957 --> 02:38:13.399]  In country after country, because it's globally coordinated.
[02:38:13.459 --> 02:38:18.721]  I've just come off a two and a half hour interview with people in Melbourne, Australia.
[02:38:18.901 --> 02:38:26.665]  And what's happening there is, you know, well, what's happening there is the precursor to what's planned in the Northern Hemisphere when we hit our winter.
[02:38:26.705 --> 02:38:27.725]  They're in their winter now.
[02:38:28.145 --> 02:38:31.447]  And that is outright full blown fascism.
[02:38:31.847 --> 02:38:37.249]  But people look at the society as it's transformed and they say, oh, my God, it's happened so quick.
[02:38:37.950 --> 02:38:38.230]  Yeah.
[02:38:39.252 --> 02:38:49.840]  But the speed of transformation of human society is equivalent exactly to the speed of human acquiescence to it.
[02:38:51.080 --> 02:38:56.244]  If that had been pushed back, and we're not having it, months ago, we wouldn't be where we are now.
[02:38:56.925 --> 02:39:07.272]  And you know, when you break down how a few can control vast numbers, it's a very simple structure.
[02:39:08.424 --> 02:39:19.746]  And while people may sit around moaning that it's going on and pointing out the evil people involved in it, and they should because they are, they also need to find a bloody mirror.
[02:39:20.567 --> 02:39:31.109]  Because we are, as a human race, completely responsible as well for what's happening for this reason.
[02:39:32.990 --> 02:39:35.352]  People say that a few can't control the world.
[02:39:35.432 --> 02:39:38.635]  Well, it's easy when this happens and I'll explain.
[02:39:39.075 --> 02:39:44.820]  You think of a pyramid and at the top of the pyramid is a tiny few people, what I call the cult.
[02:39:45.200 --> 02:39:45.981]  Some people call it the 1%.
[02:39:46.701 --> 02:39:48.002]  I call it the cult because it is.
[02:39:48.943 --> 02:39:52.086]  And then that cult in a circle
[02:39:52.848 --> 02:39:53.409]  I'm good.
[02:40:10.703 --> 02:40:15.545]  Who have no idea there even is a cult or there even is a global conspiracy.
[02:40:15.565 --> 02:40:16.006]  Exactly.
[02:40:16.026 --> 02:40:21.208]  They're falling like dominoes and that's why when we go out and resist the park closures, they just stand down.
[02:40:21.228 --> 02:40:21.869]  The police agree.
[02:40:22.089 --> 02:40:22.509]  We hate this.
[02:40:22.549 --> 02:40:22.909]  It's wrong.
[02:40:22.949 --> 02:40:23.509]  Do what you want.
[02:40:23.850 --> 02:40:25.050]  But no one's pushing back.
[02:40:25.110 --> 02:40:28.332]  But when we do push down and push back, the dominoes falls.
[02:40:28.352 --> 02:40:34.255]  What you're saying is stop just acquiescing and repeating what comes down from the United Nations, from the globalists.
[02:40:35.075 --> 02:40:35.576]  Yeah.
[02:40:35.696 --> 02:40:40.338]  And when you follow this this pyramid down, it's very simple.
[02:40:41.416 --> 02:40:47.119]  Each higher level acquiesces to the level above and imposes on the level below.
[02:40:47.179 --> 02:40:58.325]  So it's imposition, acquiescence, imposition, acquiescence, imposition, acquiescence, until you reach the body of the population, again, nationally and internationally.
[02:40:58.766 --> 02:41:04.709]  And if we, as a human race, then, at our point in the pyramid,
[02:41:05.247 --> 02:41:05.568]  Thank you.
[02:41:15.433 --> 02:41:31.563]  completes a sequence of imposition and acquiescence, which allows a tiny few at the top of the pyramid, which the vast majority of people in the pyramid have no idea exists, to impose its will on the entirety of the population.
[02:41:32.024 --> 02:41:36.166]  And without human acquiescence, none of this is possible.
[02:41:36.606 --> 02:41:41.950]  This cult and these authorities have no power.
[02:41:42.491 --> 02:41:44.034]  Let's not fall for that one.
[02:41:44.334 --> 02:41:46.198]  They have no power.
[02:41:46.619 --> 02:41:50.026]  The power that they use recycled back against us.
[02:41:50.046 --> 02:41:50.567]  We give them.
[02:41:52.774 --> 02:42:01.561]  We had a few weeks ago, just down the coast from where I live, we had thousands of people hit the beaches because it was such a really hot period.
[02:42:02.382 --> 02:42:08.186]  And there were so many people on the beaches, social distancing, unsocial distancing was not possible.
[02:42:08.586 --> 02:42:13.770]  So the local authority in the area calls an emergency incident.
[02:42:14.791 --> 02:42:16.492]  OK, you called an emergency incident.
[02:42:16.572 --> 02:42:18.014]  Oh, yeah, emergency incident.
[02:42:18.054 --> 02:42:18.674]  What's happening?
[02:42:18.694 --> 02:42:19.615]  OK, so what are you going to do?
[02:42:20.652 --> 02:42:21.633]  Well, there's nothing we can do.
[02:42:21.653 --> 02:42:24.374]  We've got thousands of people on the beach, and they won't obey.
[02:42:24.554 --> 02:42:25.434]  They won't cooperate.
[02:42:25.855 --> 02:42:26.795]  Nothing we can do.
[02:42:27.215 --> 02:42:29.296]  So, why can't we do that with masks?
[02:42:29.857 --> 02:42:31.798]  Why can't we do that with social distancing?
[02:42:32.218 --> 02:42:34.759]  Which have nothing to do with health and everything to do with psychology.
[02:42:34.779 --> 02:42:35.239]  Stay there, David.
[02:42:35.259 --> 02:42:36.020]  You're on fire.
[02:42:36.060 --> 02:42:37.080]  This is the key to everything.
[02:42:37.100 --> 02:42:38.081]  And then let's ask the question.
[02:42:38.601 --> 02:42:40.302]  A lot of people say, oh, I'll wear my mask, so what?
[02:42:40.342 --> 02:42:52.025]  They don't get that once you complete the circuit, it's a test to then accept contact tracing, then accept the social distancing apps, then accept the implantable chip, then accept the forced inoculation, then accept all of it.
[02:42:52.345 --> 02:42:57.867]  That's what it's about, is breaking our will, the spider, the cult, exercising its will.
[02:42:58.187 --> 02:42:59.907]  How do we get people to turn their will on?
[02:43:00.127 --> 02:43:01.808]  With David Icke, straight ahead, stay with us.
[02:43:01.828 --> 02:43:05.149]  I'm always most proud of, for eight years,
[02:43:05.899 --> 02:43:10.482]  There wasn't one single hint of a scandal earlier.
[02:43:11.243 --> 02:43:14.325]  President under pressure from a trifecta of scandals.
[02:43:14.345 --> 02:43:20.110]  President Barack Obama trying to get ahead of just one of the three scandals now consuming the country's attention.
[02:43:20.230 --> 02:43:25.153]  That scandal involving the Secret Service and accusations of drinking and hiring prostitutes in Colombia.
[02:43:25.314 --> 02:43:26.835]  The Obama spying scandal.
[02:43:26.935 --> 02:43:28.876]  The mother of all scandals, Spygate.
[02:43:28.896 --> 02:43:29.657]  This is a big scandal.
[02:43:30.097 --> 02:43:30.517]  Scandal.
[02:43:30.537 --> 02:43:31.497]  It's a huge scandal.
[02:43:31.517 --> 02:43:32.498]  The gun walker scandal.
[02:43:32.538 --> 02:43:33.238]  The VA scandal.
[02:43:33.258 --> 02:43:33.998]  The VA scandal.
[02:43:34.038 --> 02:43:36.979]  It's a scandal telling America you can keep your doctor.
[02:43:36.999 --> 02:43:38.759]  A callous deception that hurts millions.
[02:43:38.840 --> 02:43:43.241]  Today widespread embarrassment about this scandal has really turned to disgust.
[02:43:43.401 --> 02:43:49.422]  All of this comes as a White House that takes pride in being scandal free has been hammered by a series of controversies.
[02:43:49.443 --> 02:43:50.063]  The latest?
[02:43:50.303 --> 02:43:58.065]  Revelations the Justice Department obtained two months of telephone records of reporters at the Associated Press as part of a leak investigation.
[02:43:58.425 --> 02:44:10.581]  I believe there's been a pattern by this administration in not taking responsibility for failures, avoiding blame, pointing the fingers in somebody else's direction.
[02:44:11.802 --> 02:44:12.503]  Would you agree with that?
[02:44:13.765 --> 02:44:13.945]  No.
[02:44:14.145 --> 02:44:14.866]  For eight years.
[02:44:15.547 --> 02:44:19.571]  There wasn't one single hint of a scandal.
[02:44:20.012 --> 02:44:32.304]  The CIA went in to walled off Senate computers in a bona fide investigation that's being done of the detention and interrogation of detainees.
[02:44:32.745 --> 02:44:38.471]  As far as the allegations of, you know, CIA hacking into, you know, Senate computers, nothing could be further from the truth.
[02:44:38.982 --> 02:44:47.851]  CIA Director John Brennan apologized today after an internal investigation determined the agency had spied on staff members of the United States Senate.
[02:44:48.171 --> 02:44:50.594]  Firestorms surrounding the IRS.
[02:44:50.634 --> 02:44:53.116]  Last night, we asked if what they did was fair.
[02:44:53.176 --> 02:44:56.580]  Tonight, the FBI is asking, was it criminal?
[02:44:57.280 --> 02:45:01.603]  I first learned about it from the same news reports that I think most people learned about this.
[02:45:01.783 --> 02:45:10.489]  In the years before the election, more liberal groups were being approved, while conservative groups with names like Patriot, Constitution, and Tea Party were stymied.
[02:45:10.769 --> 02:45:14.331]  In 2011, not a single Tea Party group was approved.
[02:45:14.571 --> 02:45:23.896]  Operation Fast and Furious, an Obama administration program that let thousands of assault weapons fall into the hands of violent Mexican drug cartels.
[02:45:24.056 --> 02:45:28.718]  Guns found in over 170 crime scenes, including the murder of a U.S.
[02:45:28.798 --> 02:45:30.079]  Border Patrol agent.
[02:45:30.159 --> 02:45:37.082]  The Obama administration denied the program's existence and withheld information to protect political appointees.
[02:45:37.323 --> 02:45:39.704]  The Dallas Morning News calls this a cover-up.
[02:45:40.004 --> 02:45:41.865]  Will anyone be held accountable?
[02:45:42.125 --> 02:45:44.546]  With one single hint.
[02:45:44.906 --> 02:45:47.267]  My main concern is fixing a problem.
[02:45:47.707 --> 02:45:54.210]  New questions over who is to blame for the deaths of some of America's most elite warriors in a helicopter crash.
[02:45:54.290 --> 02:45:59.952]  Their families suggest that the White House and others are lying about their deaths and what led to them.
[02:45:59.972 --> 02:46:06.034]  All of a sudden there's movies, SEAL Team 6, documentaries, SEAL Team 6, SEAL Team 6, this, this, this.
[02:46:06.695 --> 02:46:07.635]  Where did it all start?
[02:46:09.178 --> 02:46:17.800]  Joe Biden in Delaware in a tuxedo with a half a load on, telling everybody it was the elite Navy SEAL team.
[02:46:18.040 --> 02:46:21.521]  Now to the VA scandal, which is now a criminal investigation.
[02:46:21.561 --> 02:46:28.382]  An extensive new report reveals more than 100,000 veterans waited months to see a doctor or never saw one at all.
[02:46:28.802 --> 02:46:32.343]  And some workers saying they were pressured to falsify records.
[02:46:32.463 --> 02:46:36.264]  Now the VA scandal has officially become a criminal investigation.
[02:46:36.806 --> 02:46:40.389]  I think I'm either low IQ or slow or I don't know what I am, you know?
[02:46:40.770 --> 02:46:41.590]  Slow Joe Biden?
[02:46:42.191 --> 02:46:44.193]  Now, I have to tell you, he's a different guy.
[02:46:44.693 --> 02:46:46.415]  He looks different than he used to.
[02:46:46.955 --> 02:46:48.677]  He acts different than he used to.
[02:46:50.118 --> 02:46:51.580]  I had two cranial aneurysms.
[02:46:52.721 --> 02:46:55.103]  And they literally had to take the top of my head off.
[02:46:55.163 --> 02:46:57.265]  I mean, they take a saw and they cut your head off.
[02:46:59.987 --> 02:47:01.289]  Flawless victory.
[02:47:05.157 --> 02:47:09.258]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:47:09.778 --> 02:47:11.099]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:47:18.320 --> 02:47:32.324]  I'm looking at mainstream headlines out of Australia.
[02:47:33.408 --> 02:47:37.812]  Australian law allows forced vaccines or jail to prevent suspected disease.
[02:47:39.194 --> 02:47:50.545]  It goes on to say they're now announcing a new law under the UN, that's who they cite, to take children from parents that won't allow them to be tested for COVID-19.
[02:47:51.806 --> 02:47:52.607]  They're now beginning
[02:47:55.114 --> 02:48:04.002]  To announce that universities will suspend students who leave a 4.5 mile COVID bubble who are being tracked by their phones, the equivalent of anklet races.
[02:48:05.523 --> 02:48:08.806]  David Icke has a new powerful book out titled The Answer.
[02:48:10.087 --> 02:48:12.169]  Find it at iconic.com.
[02:48:12.409 --> 02:48:16.373]  I-C-K-O-N-I-C.com or davidicke.com.
[02:48:17.954 --> 02:48:18.875]  But here we are.
[02:48:21.209 --> 02:48:23.891]  We're told you cannot criticize the U.N.
[02:48:24.412 --> 02:48:29.916]  in Europe, the U.K., Australia, New Zealand, China, the United States, Canada, Mexico.
[02:48:30.456 --> 02:48:32.058]  We're told, officially, the U.N.
[02:48:32.118 --> 02:48:34.880]  says there's no treatment for COVID-19.
[02:48:34.920 --> 02:48:35.420]  The U.N.
[02:48:35.460 --> 02:48:37.582]  says other medical doctors can't disagree.
[02:48:37.642 --> 02:48:38.203]  They're banned.
[02:48:38.583 --> 02:48:40.484]  So you wake up one day and you're under U.N.
[02:48:40.524 --> 02:48:40.885]  control.
[02:48:42.261 --> 02:48:44.322]  It's Fauci and Gates running the Wuhan lab.
[02:48:45.103 --> 02:48:48.224]  I agree with David Icke that it's basically not what's killing us.
[02:48:48.244 --> 02:48:49.385]  It's what they say is the virus.
[02:48:49.645 --> 02:48:50.846]  The numbers are extremely low.
[02:48:51.066 --> 02:48:53.687]  They're putting the names of people that died of other things in that column.
[02:48:54.188 --> 02:48:58.330]  But there is something going on at the Wuhan lab, and I think it's something else they've got planned.
[02:48:58.610 --> 02:49:03.393]  Because Bill Gates has said on national TV that, oh, a bigger, more deadly one's coming.
[02:49:03.433 --> 02:49:04.373]  This is just a test.
[02:49:04.553 --> 02:49:05.834]  I think he's telling the truth there.
[02:49:06.174 --> 02:49:07.415]  He's gloating like a supervillain.
[02:49:08.479 --> 02:49:11.701]  They're telling us that, hey, we're testing you to see how you'll comply.
[02:49:11.721 --> 02:49:15.243]  And if we will comply, the real depopulation's coming.
[02:49:15.263 --> 02:49:25.388]  So I want to talk about how we awaken humans, how we stop acting like robots, one of your first books, how we start being ourselves and saying no and breaking that circuit of control.
[02:49:25.408 --> 02:49:27.309]  But first, big picture.
[02:49:28.030 --> 02:49:31.232]  How's the world doing in its resistance to the COVID situation?
[02:49:31.652 --> 02:49:33.133]  What do you think they're going to pull next?
[02:49:33.553 --> 02:49:35.114]  How do you think it's going for them?
[02:49:35.214 --> 02:49:36.775]  And why do they want
[02:49:37.988 --> 02:49:51.722]  Well, the situation is that they have been hiding below the radar decade after decade after decade after decade.
[02:49:52.643 --> 02:49:58.429]  And we've been pointing out that they are operating below the radar.
[02:49:59.139 --> 02:50:06.605]  And I said a long, long time ago that there'll come a point when they will have to break the surface where we can see them.
[02:50:06.705 --> 02:50:10.408]  And it will be very, very difficult to deny what's going on then.
[02:50:10.869 --> 02:50:20.437]  Because when you are manipulating transformations of society under the radar, and you're trying to hide it, there comes a point we have to break the surface.
[02:50:20.457 --> 02:50:25.141]  Because if you don't, you're not going to transform society as you want.
[02:50:26.221 --> 02:50:27.262]  And when you
[02:50:28.613 --> 02:50:34.835]  If you, like, enter the room where people can see you, you've got to move very, very quickly.
[02:50:34.915 --> 02:50:46.318]  Because the slower you move, once you've put yourself on public display, and my goodness me, they've done that since the turn of 2020, the more people are going to start to wake up and are going to see it.
[02:50:46.378 --> 02:50:50.559]  Because it's painfully obvious how everybody can't see it now, it's staggering.
[02:50:51.609 --> 02:51:00.813]  And therefore you've got to try to get to that point of control before enough people have realised what's going on.
[02:51:01.213 --> 02:51:02.954]  This is why they're rushing the vaccine.
[02:51:02.994 --> 02:51:06.455]  I mean, I said when this whole thing started, the vaccine already exists.
[02:51:07.242 --> 02:51:22.169]  I'm not saying it was necessarily in, you know... No, you did say that eight months ago, but it turned out Bill Gates, through subgroups, did have a bunch of coronavirus vat vaccines ready, and already done animal trials, at least four of them, so they actually did have it ready.
[02:51:22.249 --> 02:51:23.210]  I mean, it's crazy.
[02:51:24.144 --> 02:51:26.805]  Yeah, at the very least they knew what was in it.
[02:51:27.426 --> 02:51:37.851]  And we're looking, you've mentioned some of the things, we're looking in this vaccine at things that transform not just DNA but transform the whole genetic structure of the body.
[02:51:38.531 --> 02:51:44.875]  And of course it's not going to be one vaccine, they've already said that now, it's going to be a flu-like every year or so.
[02:51:45.595 --> 02:51:50.278]  Well, James talks about five a year for adults, two for children to change your DNA.
[02:51:50.298 --> 02:51:55.001]  So what he's really doing is he wants us all guinea pigs to test changing our DNA.
[02:51:55.181 --> 02:51:56.122]  That's really what this is.
[02:51:57.063 --> 02:52:03.427]  Yeah, and so the other part of this vaccine will be a sterilization agent.
[02:52:04.028 --> 02:52:10.015]  One of the things that I've been tracking over the years in my books is the absolutely collapsing sperm counts around the world.
[02:52:10.456 --> 02:52:22.049]  I quote in the answer an article where it said that if sperm was an animal they'd be talking about it moving into the area of extinction.
[02:52:22.609 --> 02:52:35.617]  Because they want to transform the body from the biological nature we have now into synthetic biology, a synthetic type body, which will not procreate.
[02:52:36.498 --> 02:52:37.959]  So they want to do two things.
[02:52:38.059 --> 02:52:42.181]  They want to transform the body into a new form, and there'll be
[02:52:43.783 --> 02:52:44.263]  Thank you very much.
[02:52:58.764 --> 02:53:00.005]  By the way, none of this is your opinion.
[02:53:00.025 --> 02:53:00.486]  Carol Quigley.
[02:53:21.790 --> 02:53:25.754]  Yeah, Julian Huxley was a eugenicist, of course, and Aldous Huxley
[02:53:48.257 --> 02:53:56.681]  In Brave New World, written in the 1930s, was describing this very situation of the end of procreation, the end of parenthood.
[02:53:56.701 --> 02:54:04.145]  This is why parental power over their children is being deleted and deleted and deleted and handed to the schools and the states and the social services.
[02:54:04.165 --> 02:54:09.007]  It's because they're moving out of parents bringing children up, it's going to be the state bringing them up.
[02:54:09.708 --> 02:54:11.469]  And so he talked about
[02:54:13.633 --> 02:54:13.873]  Well,
[02:54:35.461 --> 02:54:41.526]  George Orwell knew about it in the 1940s, because there's two worlds.
[02:54:41.546 --> 02:54:44.808]  To understand is to understand the two worlds in the same reality.
[02:54:45.249 --> 02:54:49.792]  You've got the world that humans live in, and you've got the world of the cult.
[02:54:49.952 --> 02:54:54.336]  And the difference between the two, overwhelmingly, is the level of knowledge.
[02:54:54.956 --> 02:55:04.905]  So, you have the world of human society where knowledge is strictly limited and strictly oppressed and suppressed.
[02:55:05.245 --> 02:55:08.508]  This is done through the school system, through the media, etc.
[02:55:08.768 --> 02:55:17.596]  And you keep people on what I call the postage stamp, the postage stamp consensus of very narrow understanding of everything, because it's there systematically.
[02:55:18.056 --> 02:55:19.698]  But then you've got this other world
[02:55:20.655 --> 02:55:30.260]  Where the knowledge is vastly more advanced because it's passed over through the upper levels of the secret society network to keep it out of public circulation.
[02:55:31.541 --> 02:55:43.386]  And this other world not only has a much wider understanding of reality and the nature of reality and how we interact with it, but it also has knowledge obviously of the projected agenda.
[02:55:43.947 --> 02:55:50.070]  And because of the level of knowledge that it operates with, it's projecting technology
[02:55:50.859 --> 02:55:56.383]  Which, to the human world, doesn't exist and is, at one point, sci-fi stuff.
[02:55:56.783 --> 02:55:59.905]  But it knows this stuff exists and how to create it.
[02:56:00.005 --> 02:56:00.586]  That's right.
[02:56:00.826 --> 02:56:02.867]  The future is here, it's not evenly distributed.
[02:56:02.907 --> 02:56:08.191]  And they're building this post-human railway, this post-human system, while phasing us out.
[02:56:08.291 --> 02:56:13.134]  And now they've got to the point, in the Wall Street Journal, looking forward to the post-human future.
[02:56:13.675 --> 02:56:18.038]  And now they're admitting, in NBC News, that humans will soon be phased out.
[02:56:18.618 --> 02:56:22.201]  And that they're going to direct our evolution and that, hey, we're not really humans.
[02:56:22.241 --> 02:56:25.103]  We don't believe in aliens, but we believe we are becoming them.
[02:56:25.304 --> 02:56:26.344]  I mean, that's what they're saying.
[02:56:26.384 --> 02:56:28.346]  So something, this is heavy.
[02:56:29.327 --> 02:56:42.097]  But you know, this is why, because this other world, if you can access it because either you're an insider or because you spend decades working your backside off uncovering it, you can predict the future.
[02:56:42.117 --> 02:56:43.819]  Because the future, unless there's
[02:56:44.531 --> 02:56:48.634]  An end to acquiescence, so it can't become the future, becomes the future.
[02:56:48.674 --> 02:56:51.575]  So, predicting the agenda becomes predicting the future.
[02:56:52.076 --> 02:57:04.383]  And because of this level of knowledge, in this other reality, this other world, this is why Huxley could talk about genetic changes and drug changes that didn't exist then.
[02:57:04.844 --> 02:57:06.525]  In the human world, that was... What?
[02:57:06.585 --> 02:57:07.325]  That's incredible!
[02:57:07.405 --> 02:57:10.087]  And it happened exactly as he said it would.
[02:57:10.828 --> 02:57:19.400]  Yeah, and this is why Orwell was able to talk about telescreens, which are now the first precursors of those, of course, are the smart TVs.
[02:57:19.821 --> 02:57:23.125]  And I've quoted people in my books from, for instance, 1969, where
[02:57:25.680 --> 02:57:30.522]  Insiders who were describing the internet, who were saying we're gonna make boys and girls the same.
[02:57:30.942 --> 02:57:38.345]  Now, they know that because their knowledge base is vastly in advance of the human society.
[02:57:38.405 --> 02:57:38.725]  Incredible.
[02:57:38.765 --> 02:57:41.587]  Stay there David Icke, and we're gonna come back in two minutes with the next hour.
[02:57:42.527 --> 02:57:45.668]  But they don't like the fact that you and I and many others were ahead of the curve.
[02:57:46.088 --> 02:57:47.849]  So now that it's all happening, we have credibility.
[02:57:48.109 --> 02:57:49.350]  How are they gonna try to stop that?
[02:57:49.370 --> 02:57:50.270]  Well, with censorship.
[02:57:50.390 --> 02:57:51.350]  But that's not working.
[02:57:51.551 --> 02:57:52.431]  Everybody tell folks to...
[02:57:55.137 --> 02:58:02.300]  From the very beginning, Democrats, the media, and the World Health Organization got coronavirus wrong.
[02:58:02.840 --> 02:58:09.562]  The World Health Organization said, authorities have found no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.
[02:58:09.882 --> 02:58:12.383]  Overall, most people should not be terribly concerned about it.
[02:58:12.443 --> 02:58:13.844]  Everything is fine here.
[02:58:13.944 --> 02:58:17.145]  We do want to say to people, come to Chinatown.
[02:58:17.605 --> 02:58:18.206]  Here we are.
[02:58:18.466 --> 02:58:19.066]  Come join us.
[02:58:19.426 --> 02:58:23.069]  We don't even think it's going to be as bad as it was in other countries.
[02:58:23.269 --> 02:58:25.371]  Go about your lives, go about your business.
[02:58:26.909 --> 02:58:31.690]  One leader took decisive action to save lives, President Donald Trump.
[02:58:32.130 --> 02:58:37.411]  Banning travel from China and coronavirus epicenters, Biden charged xenophobia.
[02:58:37.651 --> 02:58:45.313]  But President Trump was right, signing the CARES Act, providing immediate relief to American families, workers, and businesses.
[02:58:45.513 --> 02:58:51.394]  Declaring a national emergency, tapping into $42 billion in existing emergency funding.
[02:58:51.754 --> 02:58:54.895]  Quickly getting crucial personal protective equipment to the states.
[02:58:55.735 --> 02:58:58.860]  Signing the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.
[02:58:59.401 --> 02:59:05.930]  Ensuring that American families and businesses impacted by the virus receive the strong support they need.
[02:59:06.371 --> 02:59:11.318]  Launching Operation Warp Speed to fast track a vaccine in record time.
[02:59:13.854 --> 02:59:16.596]  He said everything that I could have hoped for.
[02:59:16.756 --> 02:59:18.558]  Promise made, promise kept.
[02:59:18.598 --> 02:59:21.320]  He is ready, willing, and able to help.
[02:59:21.560 --> 02:59:23.361]  He has been responsive.
[02:59:23.461 --> 02:59:25.062]  He's done a lot of good things.
[02:59:25.303 --> 02:59:29.486]  What the federal government did was a phenomenal accomplishment.
[02:59:29.586 --> 02:59:33.409]  In our hour of need, you all literally are helping us in a big way.
[02:59:33.429 --> 02:59:37.832]  We were at the edge, and this is life-or-death stuff, and we're forever thankful for that.
[02:59:38.252 --> 02:59:42.956]  Soon, we will emerge safer, stronger, and greater than ever.
[02:59:55.123 --> 03:00:01.066]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:08.209 --> 03:00:16.393]  Well, every time David Icke comes on, I've been interviewing him for 25 years or so, he just gets more eloquent and he's a real blessing for the species.
[03:00:16.413 --> 03:00:19.274]  There's a five-minute segment, long segment coming up here in a moment.
[03:00:20.615 --> 03:00:21.015]  But David,
[03:00:22.113 --> 03:00:27.055]  We can break down the way society operates into different areas, but you have conquest government, you have renaissance government.
[03:00:27.115 --> 03:00:28.336]  Of course, there's always a mix of those two.
[03:00:28.356 --> 03:00:30.837]  You have predatory government, you have altruistic government.
[03:00:31.898 --> 03:00:37.560]  But as you describe so many people in corporate life and business, they know it's all hierarchical.
[03:00:37.580 --> 03:00:40.162]  They just learn to do whatever they're told, so they're pushed up higher.
[03:00:41.007 --> 03:00:54.142]  But still, they're not their own person, and it builds stagnation, and we know it's an anti-human endgame, that we're basically gestating, you know, this alien globalist force, and at one point we're to be destroyed, which we're now entering that phase.
[03:00:55.077 --> 03:01:01.201]  But so many men that are actually smart on the surface, they decide to serve it, they think we're dumb to even try to study what's really going on.
[03:01:01.781 --> 03:01:10.807]  I was lucky enough that my dad never got into the higher levels of this group, but he did get recruited in high school into it, and he told me about a lot of it when I was a kid and said he got out of it.
[03:01:11.288 --> 03:01:14.130]  He didn't get the more fantastical realms of it, but he was dead on.
[03:01:14.150 --> 03:01:17.212]  And so I kind of had to jump on things.
[03:01:17.252 --> 03:01:23.255]  I guess you woke up working inside the BBC and other things and seeing the angle of what was happening, but the short segment we have here,
[03:01:24.236 --> 03:01:30.862]  I cannot describe to people the value of knowing how things really work in business or life or stocks.
[03:01:30.902 --> 03:01:33.064]  If I want to do the stock market, I'm almost always winning.
[03:01:33.344 --> 03:01:40.971]  If I want to know how to stuff the outcome, and then it's like people that don't have the knowledge, they think it's foolish and laugh at us when we do, but they're not laughing now.
[03:01:41.271 --> 03:01:45.956]  So what happens as it becomes clear that humans that are aware of the real world
[03:01:47.273 --> 03:01:54.017]  Well, you know, I come from a different angle, Alex, to many people who look at this network, what I call the cult, as this powerful entity.
[03:01:54.277 --> 03:01:56.679]  I see it as a bunch of frightened little boys and girls in short trousers.
[03:02:16.140 --> 03:02:22.367]  And, you know, when you think, I'll give you an example of what I mean to support that.
[03:02:23.408 --> 03:02:32.337]  When you look at this cult, it's because of its control of money and its control of all the institutions of society.
[03:02:33.498 --> 03:02:39.444]  It controls the media and the information that people overwhelmingly receive.
[03:02:40.174 --> 03:02:47.557]  It controls the Silicon Valley giants and therefore again controls not only what people see but what people don't see.
[03:02:48.017 --> 03:03:05.583]  Controls the banking system, controls governments, controls corporations and yet it has to ban people like me and people like you because it's frightened of what we're doing and it's frightened of what we're doing because
[03:03:07.069 --> 03:03:21.155]  It can only survive, and its narrative, not least about this virus for goodness sake, what a crock of crap that is, it can only survive by protecting it from exposure.
[03:03:21.855 --> 03:03:29.398]  And the more that they censor, the more evidence you have of where the real power is.
[03:03:30.137 --> 03:03:34.700]  You know, all that control, and yet they have to take my videos down.
[03:03:34.720 --> 03:03:36.201]  They have to take my YouTube channel down.
[03:03:36.221 --> 03:03:49.610]  Oh, I totally agree with you that they're all about suppressing and controlling humans because we're more advanced to them, so it's basically like a Space Coast episode where the centipede or the praying mantis creature is trying to figure out how to control American television and can't even figure it out.
[03:03:49.830 --> 03:03:53.113]  I mean, they've got the power, but they don't have any of the knowledge.
[03:03:53.933 --> 03:03:59.237]  Yeah, they have the control of the institutions, but they don't have the power.
[03:04:00.243 --> 03:04:01.264]  We have the power.
[03:04:01.804 --> 03:04:11.289]  And their narrative is so tenuous that if people were left to freely expose it, it would be over.
[03:04:11.809 --> 03:04:12.570]  So they have to.
[03:04:12.790 --> 03:04:15.872]  This is, again, where the power's coming from.
[03:04:16.372 --> 03:04:18.093]  They're not censoring
[03:04:18.849 --> 03:04:20.630]  Because it's a bit of fun.
[03:04:20.650 --> 03:04:23.730]  And they're not censoring to posture their power.
[03:04:24.050 --> 03:04:25.971]  They're censoring because they've got no choice.
[03:04:26.091 --> 03:04:29.012]  Oh, I agree because once they censored us, we only got bigger.
[03:04:29.872 --> 03:04:30.972]  And they're more scared.
[03:04:30.992 --> 03:04:31.473]  I mean, they're scared.
[03:04:31.493 --> 03:04:32.313]  I've been around globalists.
[03:04:32.533 --> 03:04:32.993]  They're scared.
[03:04:33.013 --> 03:04:33.473]  Stay there, David.
[03:04:33.493 --> 03:04:34.193]  We're back in 60 seconds.
[03:04:34.493 --> 03:04:36.434]  I want to ask you some questions you might not have ever been asked.
[03:04:37.294 --> 03:04:46.704]  And I know you're here to just educate the public, and we really appreciate it, but I want to talk about your book, How People Get It, because people really need to know the truth of what's going on, and David Icke is dead on the target.
[03:04:46.724 --> 03:04:50.268]  He's like Robin Hood, where he splits his own era, and we're very, very honored to have him.
[03:04:50.288 --> 03:04:53.451]  DavidIcke.com, and you can find the new book, The Answer, there.
[03:04:53.511 --> 03:04:56.895]  I'm Alex Jones with NewsWars.com and Band.Video.
[03:04:56.975 --> 03:04:59.057]  Only way those links get out is if you share them.
[03:04:59.077 --> 03:04:59.458]  Stay with us.
[03:05:04.008 --> 03:05:05.188]  The year is 2020.
[03:05:06.249 --> 03:05:25.433]  Following several decades of systematically weakening the social, moral, and financial resilience of the American people, the global cabal has launched a series of unimaginable terrorists that have rocked the foundation of Western civilization and has fractured the population of a once united country along increasingly irreconcilable lines.
[03:05:26.013 --> 03:05:37.789]  The nation finds herself on the precipice of all-out civil war, diving headlong towards economic ruin, and already suffocating under the dictatorship of biotechnocratic enslavement.
[03:05:37.809 --> 03:05:41.553]  The final takedown order has been issued, the direct attack has begun.
[03:05:42.719 --> 03:05:46.763]  America's greatest trial, and the battle for her survival, is underway.
[03:05:47.524 --> 03:05:53.029]  InfoWars Emergency Transmissions are now broadcasting live weeknights 7 to 9 p.m.
[03:05:53.109 --> 03:05:54.331]  Central Standard Time.
[03:05:54.631 --> 03:05:55.752]  Election Countdown.
[03:05:56.072 --> 03:06:00.056]  Taking America back on Band.Video and InfoWars.com.
[03:06:00.277 --> 03:06:03.420]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:06:29.830 --> 03:06:31.352]  Humanity has the power.
[03:06:31.893 --> 03:06:32.934]  We have the power.
[03:06:33.435 --> 03:06:34.616]  You have the power.
[03:06:35.737 --> 03:06:38.361]  David Icke is amazing.
[03:06:38.761 --> 03:06:39.122]  I love him.
[03:06:40.043 --> 03:06:43.127]  He's a trailblazer, a visionary, and he's been dead on.
[03:06:44.878 --> 03:06:45.399]  Dead on.
[03:06:45.619 --> 03:06:47.381]  And here he is with his new book, The Answer.
[03:06:47.441 --> 03:06:49.043]  We've got him for another 50 minutes or so.
[03:06:49.063 --> 03:06:49.683]  We're very honored.
[03:06:50.024 --> 03:06:50.925]  The book came out today.
[03:06:50.965 --> 03:06:51.746]  DavidIke.com.
[03:06:51.806 --> 03:06:52.747]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:06:53.588 --> 03:07:00.275]  David, let's look forward to the future like you did back in 1992-93 when you really started warning people and you got ridiculed and laughed at.
[03:07:01.116 --> 03:07:03.078]  But of course, didn't even care if you knew the truth.
[03:07:03.098 --> 03:07:04.499]  People ask how I take it.
[03:07:04.720 --> 03:07:05.300]  I know I'm right.
[03:07:06.221 --> 03:07:09.623]  And we're doing our own research to come up with basically the same answers from different perspectives.
[03:07:10.363 --> 03:07:12.464]  And so is the general public.
[03:07:12.864 --> 03:07:16.086]  So as that quickening happens, the enemy's been forced to accelerate their plan.
[03:07:16.426 --> 03:07:17.487]  They've been forced to emerge.
[03:07:18.527 --> 03:07:19.328]  They're very scared.
[03:07:19.348 --> 03:07:19.968]  You can see that.
[03:07:20.348 --> 03:07:21.149]  We have the power.
[03:07:21.569 --> 03:07:23.170]  They know it's slipping out of their hands.
[03:07:24.530 --> 03:07:26.191]  What are they going to do to try to counter that?
[03:07:26.211 --> 03:07:27.892]  And how do you imagine or project?
[03:07:27.912 --> 03:07:28.872]  I know it's all up to us.
[03:07:29.953 --> 03:07:31.634]  But as a general in the pro-human fight,
[03:07:33.098 --> 03:07:33.198]  Well,
[03:08:01.764 --> 03:08:07.866]  Human consciousness, individually and collectively, is human society.
[03:08:09.047 --> 03:08:13.428]  So if you look at human society now, it's a reflection of human consciousness.
[03:08:14.068 --> 03:08:23.792]  And when human consciousness changes, in other words, human perception changes, then the world will change to express, project that change of perception.
[03:08:24.492 --> 03:08:25.793]  So if you are
[03:08:27.253 --> 03:08:28.415]  Thank you.
[03:08:42.640 --> 03:08:48.563]  are almost not imposed upon us so much as we impose them on ourselves, right?
[03:08:49.484 --> 03:08:50.524]  I've not worn a mask.
[03:08:50.584 --> 03:08:52.465]  They can stick that where the sun don't shine.
[03:08:53.086 --> 03:08:58.008]  I've not rubbed a sanitiser on my hands, poisoned me bloody self.
[03:08:58.349 --> 03:09:00.370]  I've not got involved in their track and trace.
[03:09:00.430 --> 03:09:01.670]  I never will do any of it.
[03:09:02.531 --> 03:09:05.753]  And therefore, I'm not acquiescing to them.
[03:09:05.913 --> 03:09:08.014]  I'm living my life as I've always lived my life.
[03:09:09.095 --> 03:09:15.320]  And everyone could do that and together we'd be unstoppable.
[03:09:15.540 --> 03:09:19.664]  What they're trying to impose upon us would be unenforceable.
[03:09:19.684 --> 03:09:22.927]  I mean, how do you enforce masks on everybody?
[03:09:22.947 --> 03:09:28.031]  There's not enough police officers for a start and you can't do it.
[03:09:28.452 --> 03:09:32.055]  You do it because people overwhelmingly acquiesce and then the next thing
[03:09:32.868 --> 03:09:32.928]  Yes.
[03:09:47.556 --> 03:09:51.299]  Vast numbers of people believe the rubbish that they were told.
[03:09:51.539 --> 03:09:53.661]  Therefore, I've got to go under lockdown.
[03:09:53.701 --> 03:09:55.702]  That's my perception because I'm in danger.
[03:09:55.782 --> 03:09:57.423]  And it's all been proven to be a lie.
[03:09:57.543 --> 03:10:02.587]  And then Fauci says trust the science when everything he told us was completely fraudulent.
[03:10:04.588 --> 03:10:06.129]  He couldn't spell science.
[03:10:07.230 --> 03:10:15.076]  And so the other group of people that went under lockdown and acquiesced were those that, well, there's something not right here.
[03:10:15.922 --> 03:10:21.687]  But their perception was, what's the consequences for me of doing anything about it and standing up to it?
[03:10:21.727 --> 03:10:25.590]  So those two perceptual groups went into lockdown.
[03:10:25.970 --> 03:10:27.472]  So we went into lockdown.
[03:10:28.232 --> 03:10:31.995]  The perception became the reality, became the experience.
[03:10:32.376 --> 03:10:33.617]  Now we can reverse that.
[03:10:34.358 --> 03:10:38.940]  And we reverse it by ceasing to acquiesce and ceasing to do what we're told.
[03:10:39.340 --> 03:10:47.342]  You see, you can listen to government, you can listen to authority, and they tell you, you know, you need to do this, and you're like, OK, and you can go, OK.
[03:10:47.963 --> 03:10:49.863]  So tell me why, right?
[03:10:49.943 --> 03:10:51.124]  And OK, I'll hear that.
[03:10:51.184 --> 03:10:52.324]  I'm going to do a bit of research.
[03:10:53.084 --> 03:10:56.986]  And sometimes you might say, well, do you know, yeah, I agree with that.
[03:10:57.626 --> 03:10:59.246]  I'm going to do that because it makes sense to me.
[03:10:59.687 --> 03:11:00.787]  I'm making the decision.
[03:11:02.042 --> 03:11:08.994]  But when you are acquiescing by reflex action, just because some prat in a dark suit tells you to...
[03:11:09.938 --> 03:11:11.658]  That is subjugation.
[03:11:12.138 --> 03:11:14.699]  And that's what leads to the few controlling the many.
[03:11:14.919 --> 03:11:15.279]  That's right.
[03:11:15.299 --> 03:11:18.920]  And a lot of people think if they buck something, they're being uppity, they're causing a stir.
[03:11:18.940 --> 03:11:20.420]  No, we need to start saying no.
[03:11:20.440 --> 03:11:24.421]  When they said all the parks are closed in Austin, and people were acquiescing, I went down there.
[03:11:24.441 --> 03:11:28.861]  Then they said, oh, sign up for COVID tracing at a huge giant parks that are as big as a national park.
[03:11:29.181 --> 03:11:34.102]  And we just marched in there, got in the face of the people, and the police said, yeah, there's no law you can't have.
[03:11:34.442 --> 03:11:37.923]  Hired bureaucrats blocking people to a park, so they had to open it back up.
[03:11:38.363 --> 03:11:41.044]  And it's just that people just have to push back.
[03:11:41.985 --> 03:11:43.085]  That's all it is.
[03:11:43.125 --> 03:11:46.147]  You know, we don't have to fight the enemy.
[03:11:47.167 --> 03:11:50.849]  We don't have to even protest, though people can if they want.
[03:11:52.090 --> 03:11:55.831]  All we need is the power of no.
[03:11:55.851 --> 03:11:58.032]  I'm not doing it.
[03:11:59.113 --> 03:12:02.334]  And you cumulatively have people saying, no, we're not doing it.
[03:12:02.735 --> 03:12:03.655]  Oh, we've had a discussion.
[03:12:03.675 --> 03:12:04.596]  Oh, we're going to do this.
[03:12:04.896 --> 03:12:05.996]  No, we're not doing it.
[03:12:06.637 --> 03:12:07.437]  We're not doing it.
[03:12:08.098 --> 03:12:09.659]  So where's your power now?
[03:12:09.819 --> 03:12:10.940]  What, you haven't got any?
[03:12:11.361 --> 03:12:17.205]  Your power was always in us saying, well, I don't like it, but I've got to do it because they told you.
[03:12:17.526 --> 03:12:18.306]  It's the law.
[03:12:18.887 --> 03:12:19.647]  It's the law!
[03:12:19.707 --> 03:12:28.034]  But if the law's a load of old crap and designed specifically to enslave you, your kids and your grandkids, what are we doing acquiescing to it?
[03:12:28.854 --> 03:12:32.177]  This is the change of perception.
[03:12:32.237 --> 03:12:34.098]  No, I know you're trying to get people to shift their perception.
[03:12:34.138 --> 03:12:35.039]  I'm asking you, though.
[03:12:35.319 --> 03:12:37.540]  How's it going for the evil spider?
[03:12:37.941 --> 03:12:39.302]  And what do you expect?
[03:12:39.902 --> 03:12:40.683]  What would it look like?
[03:12:41.103 --> 03:12:42.424]  How do you see the enemy falling?
[03:12:42.444 --> 03:12:42.684]  I get it.
[03:12:42.944 --> 03:12:46.006]  We wake up, we say no, and then this group becomes irrelevant.
[03:12:46.026 --> 03:12:46.827]  They all go to prison.
[03:12:47.107 --> 03:12:52.651]  I mean, already these blood-drinking, devil-worshipping child molesters are... Everything you said 30 years ago is coming out.
[03:12:52.671 --> 03:12:54.813]  Everything I said 26 years ago is coming out.
[03:12:54.933 --> 03:12:56.714]  I mean, it doesn't look like things are going too well for them.
[03:12:58.713 --> 03:13:05.280]  Fortunately for us, they have an unsellable frontman in Bill Gates.
[03:13:05.560 --> 03:13:08.984]  I mean, people with their eyes closed.
[03:13:09.004 --> 03:13:14.030]  Which shows it's not a human agenda because he doesn't even have human instincts.
[03:13:15.331 --> 03:13:16.933]  Who would come up with Bill Gates as the frontman?
[03:13:17.987 --> 03:13:22.989]  I mean, it's extraordinary, and it's a great thing, because he's unsellable.
[03:13:23.529 --> 03:13:28.091]  I mean, he's got I Am Frickin' Evil stamped on his forehead.
[03:13:28.511 --> 03:13:38.915]  So he's a really hard sell, and that's a good thing, because they can't disconnect Gates from the vaccine now, which is excellent from a pushback point of view.
[03:13:40.375 --> 03:13:40.716]  It is.
[03:13:40.816 --> 03:13:44.137]  But what they will be seeking to do, and it will be in the script,
[03:13:45.838 --> 03:13:50.319]  Because they're terrified, you see, they're terrified of this gathering momentum.
[03:13:50.779 --> 03:13:56.420]  This is where all the bans on gatherings of people beyond a handful comes from.
[03:13:56.540 --> 03:13:59.201]  They're terrified of pushback.
[03:13:59.681 --> 03:14:09.662]  What they've done in this country is introduce fines for not wearing a mask in the situations that they've decreed, of up to £3,200, which is a lot of money for people.
[03:14:12.483 --> 03:14:12.663]  Yeah.
[03:14:30.641 --> 03:14:33.785]  Fundamental necessities to life as they can.
[03:14:33.905 --> 03:14:36.287]  So obviously they're going to create food shortages.
[03:14:37.108 --> 03:14:43.855]  They're going to get control of the electricity grids and obviously they've got control of the internet from an on-off point of view.
[03:14:44.256 --> 03:14:50.002]  So they're going to try... And by the way in blue states everywhere they're now doing rolling blackouts on purpose just like you said.
[03:14:51.092 --> 03:14:54.613]  Yeah, so it's the necessities of life they want to control.
[03:14:55.033 --> 03:15:01.654]  Because everything they are doing is to stop this momentum of non-acquiescence.
[03:15:01.674 --> 03:15:02.634]  Because that's the end of it.
[03:15:02.994 --> 03:15:03.354]  Finished.
[03:15:03.414 --> 03:15:03.774]  Kaput.
[03:15:03.994 --> 03:15:04.514]  All over.
[03:15:04.554 --> 03:15:04.975]  Thank you.
[03:15:05.035 --> 03:15:05.595]  See you later.
[03:15:06.015 --> 03:15:06.875]  Once that happens.
[03:15:07.615 --> 03:15:10.015]  And so it's like, you do that and you won't get this.
[03:15:10.116 --> 03:15:11.596]  You do that, you won't get this.
[03:15:11.696 --> 03:15:12.256]  And you're right.
[03:15:12.316 --> 03:15:16.537]  This is their big assault, their global tracking grid, their social credit score, their forced inoculation.
[03:15:16.957 --> 03:15:17.837]  If this fails,
[03:15:19.244 --> 03:15:20.005]  Then what do they do?
[03:15:20.045 --> 03:15:21.306]  This could be the end of the New World Order.
[03:15:22.467 --> 03:15:24.668]  Well, yes, it could, because they've made it.
[03:15:24.748 --> 03:15:36.838]  If you use the analogy of a long-distance race, they've been in the pack, hiding in the pack, moving this thing forward.
[03:15:37.378 --> 03:15:41.121]  And now, in 2020, they've made their run for hope.
[03:15:41.942 --> 03:15:43.063]  And you see when
[03:15:44.184 --> 03:15:49.086]  When people make the run for home in an athletics race, they have to stay in front.
[03:15:49.987 --> 03:15:51.247]  And have to get across the line.
[03:15:51.547 --> 03:15:54.228]  Because once they get caught, they start going back into the package.
[03:15:54.248 --> 03:15:55.949]  A lot of times they stumble and fall on their face.
[03:15:56.049 --> 03:15:58.290]  Powerful allegory with David Icke.
[03:15:58.310 --> 03:15:58.870]  Stay there, David.
[03:15:59.071 --> 03:16:00.751]  We'll come back and start at that point.
[03:16:02.472 --> 03:16:04.693]  Our first call comes from Scranton, Pennsylvania.
[03:16:05.133 --> 03:16:06.594]  Joe on our line from the Democrats.
[03:16:06.714 --> 03:16:07.054]  Go ahead.
[03:16:07.094 --> 03:16:07.614]  Good morning.
[03:16:08.014 --> 03:16:08.415]  Good morning.
[03:16:09.315 --> 03:16:13.577]  If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, and you ain't black,
[03:16:14.687 --> 03:16:15.788]  What the **** did he say?
[03:16:17.090 --> 03:16:19.373]  Oh, man!
[03:16:19.453 --> 03:16:22.397]  You ain't watching.
[03:16:22.697 --> 03:16:27.263]  That's like saying you, before you got in this program, you take a test where you're taking cocaine or not.
[03:16:27.303 --> 03:16:27.924]  What do you think, huh?
[03:16:27.944 --> 03:16:29.566]  Oh, but you're gonna be on YouTube!
[03:16:29.806 --> 03:16:30.307]  Oh, man!
[03:16:30.327 --> 03:16:32.570]  You're gonna be the greatest clip ever played!
[03:16:50.401 --> 03:16:51.810]  I had two cranial aneurysms.
[03:16:52.984 --> 03:16:55.366]  And they literally had to take the top of my head off.
[03:16:55.406 --> 03:16:57.387]  I mean, they take a saw and they cut your head off.
[03:16:57.868 --> 03:17:10.217]  Eight years in the White House, he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation and go in to find the artery that is, one was leaking, the other that hadn't.
[03:17:10.817 --> 03:17:12.739]  I said, Doc, what are my chances?
[03:17:12.759 --> 03:17:14.360]  I had two great neurosurgeons.
[03:17:15.121 --> 03:17:18.783]  He said, Senator, for mortality or morbidity?
[03:17:18.983 --> 03:17:19.564]  And I'm thinking,
[03:17:20.928 --> 03:17:26.831]  I said, what are my chances of getting off this table and being completely normal?
[03:17:27.431 --> 03:17:30.392]  I'll bet you're as bright as you're good looking, I tell you.
[03:17:30.632 --> 03:17:31.413]  I tell you what.
[03:17:32.473 --> 03:17:34.774]  He said, well, your chances of living are a lot better.
[03:17:34.794 --> 03:17:36.995]  All right?
[03:17:38.116 --> 03:17:40.557]  And by the way, that's one of the things that's a dangerous idea.
[03:17:40.577 --> 03:17:42.498]  You know, as these guys will tell you.
[03:17:42.718 --> 03:17:46.719]  What about the girls that you molested on C-SPAN at the Senate swearing in?
[03:17:48.652 --> 03:17:50.958]  And they literally had to take the top of my head off.
[03:17:52.241 --> 03:17:57.414]  Go to jones30330 and help me end this fight.
[03:17:57.434 --> 03:17:58.296]  Thank you very much.
[03:18:02.174 --> 03:18:07.620]  Owen Schroer here, host of the InfoWars War Room, every day from 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:18:07.820 --> 03:18:10.543]  And that means I have to follow up after the big man.
[03:18:10.784 --> 03:18:12.806]  And that is not an easy task.
[03:18:12.906 --> 03:18:18.051]  So I need to be as focused and energized as possible every day at 3 o'clock.
[03:18:18.171 --> 03:18:18.592]  So yes,
[03:18:18.912 --> 03:18:21.573]  I am on performance-enhancing drugs.
[03:18:22.033 --> 03:18:44.538]  It's the combination of the energy of the turbo force, the focus of the brain force, and then the VasoBeat Complete, which is a beet supplement, which acts as a vasodilator, which makes sure that the nutrients and supplements that you're intaking are getting all throughout the body so that I can maintain proper focus and energy for three hours and beyond.
[03:18:44.738 --> 03:18:46.019]  It's almost three o'clock.
[03:18:46.219 --> 03:18:52.684]  That means it's time to take my performance enhancers that I have conveniently stashed right here at my desk.
[03:18:52.804 --> 03:18:56.627]  I literally will never host a war room without them.
[03:18:56.807 --> 03:19:00.390]  It starts with the Turbo Force right here.
[03:19:00.570 --> 03:19:03.953]  Just get your cup of water, pour in the Turbo Force.
[03:19:04.173 --> 03:19:06.795]  I then take my Vezo B Complete right here.
[03:19:07.656 --> 03:19:09.897]  One dropper, two droppers.
[03:19:10.618 --> 03:19:12.700]  Stir it up just a little bit for good measure.
[03:19:14.338 --> 03:19:28.569]  And then, with the energy from the TurboForce and the nitrates in the VesoBeat Complete, with the Focus from BrainForce, with the Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, and all the other supplements that are inside of that.
[03:19:31.051 --> 03:19:32.211]  Those are the supplements I take.
[03:19:33.283 --> 03:19:39.748]  Every day, right before I go on air, for maximum performance, maximum focus, maximum energy.
[03:19:40.169 --> 03:19:52.999]  And the good news is, once I finish drinking this Turbo Force, I've got energy for about 10 hours, so I can continue working past the show, work on other things, go and lift weights, run, whatever I need or want to do.
[03:19:53.199 --> 03:20:01.566]  It's all with the Turbo Force, the Brain Force, and the Vezo Beat Complete Trifecta, available only at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:20:05.225 --> 03:20:09.328]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:20:09.849 --> 03:20:11.150]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:20:31.278 --> 03:20:35.180]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:20:36.781 --> 03:20:41.523]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:46.825 --> 03:20:52.248]  David Eich is here with us, ladies and gentlemen, and it's just surreal.
[03:20:53.482 --> 03:20:56.945]  To see every major publication say the earth will be better without humans.
[03:20:57.485 --> 03:20:58.747]  We must give up our bodies.
[03:21:00.068 --> 03:21:01.109]  Families are bad.
[03:21:01.129 --> 03:21:05.032]  We can't have single person homes or family homes.
[03:21:06.553 --> 03:21:11.738]  All of this is beyond Orwellian and it's the agenda.
[03:21:11.938 --> 03:21:17.823]  And I know David, you want to get into what's technically happening and who the globalists are, but getting back to your earlier work about this being non-human,
[03:21:19.349 --> 03:21:21.069]  You got attacked for that 30 years ago.
[03:21:21.770 --> 03:21:23.590]  Clearly this whole agenda is anti-human.
[03:21:23.610 --> 03:21:25.331]  They say their job is to get rid of humans.
[03:21:25.951 --> 03:21:27.511]  The goal is a post-human world.
[03:21:27.991 --> 03:21:31.692]  Now they say they want to override all the genetics of the planet and totally change it.
[03:21:31.792 --> 03:21:33.693]  It is, by definition, alien.
[03:21:34.073 --> 03:21:38.354]  The genetic engineering, they're creating new life forms that never existed before.
[03:21:39.834 --> 03:21:41.295]  So what is this?
[03:21:41.375 --> 03:21:42.176]  What is the endgame?
[03:21:42.496 --> 03:21:45.417]  I know you say we're all energy, but what are they?
[03:21:45.577 --> 03:21:46.138]  What are they?
[03:21:46.378 --> 03:21:47.678]  Why do they want the blood of children?
[03:21:47.738 --> 03:21:48.879]  Why do they want to torture people?
[03:21:49.159 --> 03:21:50.239]  Why do they love ugliness?
[03:21:50.480 --> 03:21:51.000]  Who are they?
[03:21:53.137 --> 03:22:13.755]  Well, if we had another two hours, I'd love to talk about this because, you know, I've been talking in the books for decades, decades about the fact that the force ultimately behind this is non-human and that the network, the cult that I call it in human society, which people like Gates and Soros, et cetera, are assets.
[03:22:16.511 --> 03:22:23.134]  They are the manipulators within human society on behalf of this non-human force.
[03:22:23.675 --> 03:22:25.716]  In fact, the non-human force controls them.
[03:22:26.016 --> 03:22:35.140]  And when you look at ancient writings in ancient cultures, there's a real common theme and it absolutely fits what I've been talking about all these years.
[03:22:35.620 --> 03:22:39.242]  And that is, you know, we can perceive life as form.
[03:22:39.867 --> 03:22:43.931]  You know, I have a human body, and there's another body, and another body, and an alien body.
[03:22:43.971 --> 03:22:51.499]  But ultimately, what's animating that form, what's using that form as a vehicle to experience, is consciousness.
[03:22:52.179 --> 03:23:03.731]  And imagine a balanced, harmonious level of consciousness, which people call love and other balanced emotions.
[03:23:04.554 --> 03:23:12.701]  Now imagine the absolute antipathy of that, an inverted, imbalanced, distorted state of consciousness.
[03:23:13.622 --> 03:23:20.548]  That is what this non-human force ultimately is, and it possesses this cult.
[03:23:21.229 --> 03:23:28.275]  And this is why, you know, the bloodlines are all part of this possession network, because their genetics
[03:23:29.531 --> 03:23:31.492]  Makes them more open to this possession.
[03:23:32.032 --> 03:23:41.535]  And so what you're looking at is this imbalanced, deeply disturbed state of consciousness driving this cult.
[03:23:41.575 --> 03:23:43.795]  That's why they do what they do.
[03:23:44.195 --> 03:23:45.916]  This is where psychopathy comes from.
[03:23:46.316 --> 03:23:51.938]  Psychopaths, which is what all these people are, super psychopaths with people like Gates and Soros,
[03:23:53.578 --> 03:24:01.720]  These psychopaths are an expression of this, what I've been calling for years, this mind virus.
[03:24:02.520 --> 03:24:09.942]  And what they're trying to do is to assimilate the rest of humanity into this mind virus state of consciousness.
[03:24:10.362 --> 03:24:14.843]  And it shuts them down, it isolates them in the five senses.
[03:24:15.123 --> 03:24:20.864]  What I found fascinating, Alex, in the last couple of weeks is I've been reading a lot of stuff
[03:24:21.602 --> 03:24:26.446]  On the Native American concept, one of the names for it is Wetiko.
[03:24:26.927 --> 03:24:31.771]  And what they're describing is exactly what I've been writing about for years and I'm talking about now.
[03:24:31.931 --> 03:24:33.032]  It's a mind virus.
[03:24:33.733 --> 03:24:35.635]  And you see this in all the ancient cultures.
[03:24:36.315 --> 03:24:42.541]  Sure, they had people that would go crazy and start trying to kill kids, drink blood, and just go psycho for no reason.
[03:24:43.565 --> 03:24:47.490]  This is the possession of this Wateco mind virus.
[03:24:47.530 --> 03:24:52.817]  When I say virus, I don't mean physical virus, I mean like a computer virus, that's how it works.
[03:24:53.277 --> 03:25:00.847]  Because you see, if you take the analogy of a computer, and you take that to be the five sense conscious mind of humans,
[03:25:01.474 --> 03:25:07.424]  And then you take the guy on the keyboard and the mouse to be expanded states of consciousness.
[03:25:07.845 --> 03:25:09.587]  Those two things should be interacting.
[03:25:09.708 --> 03:25:10.950]  That's our natural state.
[03:25:11.471 --> 03:25:13.794]  But what happens when the computer gets a virus?
[03:25:14.720 --> 03:25:29.706]  You bang in the keyboard, you bang in the mouse and nothing's happening because now the virus has taken over literally the perceptual information processing systems of the computer and it's going where the virus tells it.
[03:25:29.746 --> 03:25:30.867]  So all hell is breaking loose.
[03:25:30.887 --> 03:25:31.227]  That's right.
[03:25:31.247 --> 03:25:34.128]  Everything they do is about forcing us into a false reality.
[03:25:35.175 --> 03:25:53.031]  Yeah, and so the more that they can bring us into fear and imbalanced low vibrational states of emotion like anxiety and anger and hatred and all these things, the more they are basically attaching this mind virus frequency to us.
[03:25:54.152 --> 03:25:59.097]  And one of the interesting things, you'll certainly recognize this, people watching this show,
[03:26:00.242 --> 03:26:06.468]  The Native American concept talks about this Wutiko being a mind blindness which operates out of the subconscious.
[03:26:06.588 --> 03:26:08.229]  That's what he hides in the subconscious.
[03:26:08.830 --> 03:26:13.695]  And of course the cult in all its forms, its target is the human subconscious.
[03:26:14.135 --> 03:26:21.962]  Because if they can put perceptual programs in the subconscious, they'll filter through to the conscious mind.
[03:26:21.983 --> 03:26:24.305]  And the person will think they're their own thoughts, opinions and
[03:26:24.745 --> 03:26:25.266]  Thank you.
[03:26:37.034 --> 03:26:44.717]  This is why, you know, when you can have an image and you can have a subliminal insert into it, and that insert will talk to your subconscious.
[03:26:44.997 --> 03:26:54.160]  But once it's pointed out, there's that subliminal insert, the conscious mind's aware of it, that's the first thing you see when you look at the image from then on, is the insert.
[03:26:54.220 --> 03:26:56.521]  It's been made conscious, it's lost its power over you.
[03:26:56.541 --> 03:26:59.222]  That's the spell losing its power, so how do we get people out of the spell?
[03:27:00.034 --> 03:27:13.509]  So what the Native American concept of this mind blindness is, is that it tricks the conscious mind into a state of mind blindness, in other words, not knowing the hell what's going on, but it thinks it has.
[03:27:13.989 --> 03:27:15.471]  And what we're seeing all the time
[03:27:16.326 --> 03:27:30.192]  I'm seeing all the time anyway, is people who actually consciously believe they've looked at what's happening and they've come to their own conclusions and they've worked out what this virus thing is all about and what comes out of their mouth.
[03:27:30.908 --> 03:27:33.049]  Is the official narrative, word for word.
[03:27:33.329 --> 03:27:38.031]  In other words, they're blind to what's going on, but they think they're not.
[03:27:38.171 --> 03:27:39.711]  And this is the... Exactly!
[03:27:39.752 --> 03:27:49.435]  They always dial in to the stated talking point, but they think it's their own, but they word for word say it, because they become nothing but, like you said, a repeater, because it's like an electrical charge.
[03:27:49.695 --> 03:27:50.836]  They've just completed the circuit.
[03:27:51.656 --> 03:27:54.977]  Yeah, this is what this bubble is.
[03:27:55.037 --> 03:27:58.859]  They try to put people in a bubble of perception, what I call the five sense bubble.
[03:28:00.317 --> 03:28:01.878]  And people think they're thinking for themselves.
[03:28:01.898 --> 03:28:08.200]  By the way, the universities in the UK and the US are calling it a COVID safety bubble where you're not allowed to leave for the semester.
[03:28:08.220 --> 03:28:08.820]  Have you seen this?
[03:28:09.640 --> 03:28:10.540]  It's kind of funny.
[03:28:10.900 --> 03:28:17.222]  I use the concept or the symbol of the bubble in the answer when I'm talking about how, you know, people are isolated in the bubble.
[03:28:17.723 --> 03:28:19.183]  And I wrote all that.
[03:28:19.483 --> 03:28:22.064]  85% of that book was written before this stuff kicked in.
[03:28:23.044 --> 03:28:29.086]  And then what played out was what was in the first 85% of the book played out in human society.
[03:28:29.846 --> 03:28:38.932]  And then they brought in this bubble concept, which I thought was extremely synchronistic, because that's what they want us to put us in, this bubble.
[03:28:39.333 --> 03:28:44.096]  But if we stop self-identifying with being... We'll stay there.
[03:28:44.116 --> 03:28:44.876]  We've got to go to break again.
[03:28:44.896 --> 03:28:49.479]  But yeah, putting the kids in bubbles, rock concerts in bubbles, get restaurants in cages.
[03:28:49.559 --> 03:28:50.360]  It's a mental image.
[03:28:50.420 --> 03:28:50.900]  You're bad.
[03:28:50.940 --> 03:28:51.401]  You're dirty.
[03:28:51.721 --> 03:28:52.842]  We've got to keep you locked up.
[03:28:53.242 --> 03:28:53.922]  Stay there, David.
[03:28:53.942 --> 03:28:56.744]  David Icke is on fire, on fire as usual.
[03:28:57.024 --> 03:28:57.705]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:28:57.725 --> 03:28:58.325]  Newswars.com.
[03:28:58.345 --> 03:28:59.026]  Spread that link.
[03:28:59.326 --> 03:28:59.838]  We're good to go.
[03:29:18.462 --> 03:29:22.624]  InfoWars, the most banned network in the world.
[03:29:23.345 --> 03:29:31.549]  So everything InfoWars has done for 26 years, everything you've done in your life of being informed and being involved, is building towards this point, and this isn't a normal time.
[03:29:31.769 --> 03:29:32.629]  And I know you know that.
[03:29:33.310 --> 03:29:34.430]  And I salute you and I thank you.
[03:29:35.511 --> 03:29:40.834]  But when you call in thanking me for trying to self-preserve myself and you, we're in the same boat, brother.
[03:29:42.247 --> 03:29:57.391]  So I get it, I appreciate you just as much as you appreciate me, but I'm telling you, now is the time, because I need to know, I gotta decide the next week, with what we've got in our coffers, with only enough to operate, if I sold both my houses to pay for this place, it would not operate us for a month and a half.
[03:29:57.831 --> 03:30:00.351]  I don't, I'm not rich, I don't have all this money the media says I have, okay?
[03:30:01.271 --> 03:30:06.673]  Got a nice truck, a nice car, stuff like that, I got insurance for my kids, I'm doing well, I don't care, I don't need more, I'm happy.
[03:30:07.613 --> 03:30:11.154]  But if you go to InfoWareStore.com, you see the Support Us,
[03:30:12.216 --> 03:30:13.977]  Link over on the right-hand side.
[03:30:13.997 --> 03:30:19.278]  And if you click on that, you'll find the different websites and the donation page.
[03:30:19.498 --> 03:30:20.478]  They're there to support us.
[03:30:21.259 --> 03:30:26.220]  After you click on that, on the right-hand side, you need a four-stage ion filter.
[03:30:26.380 --> 03:30:28.801]  We have the best at the lowest price, because that's what I do!
[03:30:30.083 --> 03:30:34.227]  We have the best tourable food, highest quality you're going to get, unless you pay five times more.
[03:30:35.128 --> 03:30:36.149]  InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:30:36.930 --> 03:30:37.610]  The best prices.
[03:30:37.670 --> 03:30:38.511]  It's all there.
[03:30:38.932 --> 03:30:41.294]  But we've only got the ability to do business now.
[03:30:42.115 --> 03:30:45.298]  We're not going to have it much longer, if the enemy has their way.
[03:30:45.438 --> 03:30:46.999]  I'm telling you.
[03:30:47.540 --> 03:30:48.901]  I used to say, support InfoWars.
[03:30:49.362 --> 03:30:50.263]  Rescue InfoWars.
[03:30:50.343 --> 03:30:51.003]  Save yourself.
[03:30:51.344 --> 03:30:51.984]  Save the world.
[03:30:52.305 --> 03:30:53.165]  We're in this together.
[03:30:53.486 --> 03:30:54.667]  Because let me tell you something.
[03:30:54.887 --> 03:30:55.867]  Communism's up here.
[03:30:56.087 --> 03:30:59.048]  Infowars is the damn blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[03:30:59.428 --> 03:31:01.249]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[03:31:01.469 --> 03:31:03.009]  My children are right here!
[03:31:03.710 --> 03:31:09.251]  With pedophiles and devil worshippers and forced inoculations and FEMA camps coming for us and war!
[03:31:10.212 --> 03:31:12.232]  If we don't fix this now, we're gonna have to fight.
[03:31:14.313 --> 03:31:15.773]  You know, I really need to repent.
[03:31:15.793 --> 03:31:16.794]  It's a sick part of me.
[03:31:16.894 --> 03:31:17.914]  I just hope it goes down.
[03:31:22.628 --> 03:31:32.695]  Because all you devil worshippers and trash that have been pushing and pushing and pushing forever, you better hope you fail in your operation and you don't push us into the fire.
[03:31:32.715 --> 03:31:37.719]  Because I swear on the altar of God, you will pay.
[03:31:39.240 --> 03:31:40.761]  Quite frankly, I'm so alive right now.
[03:31:40.801 --> 03:31:43.443]  I'm so glad Soros and
[03:31:44.565 --> 03:31:45.645]  Bill Gates hate me.
[03:31:45.665 --> 03:31:48.706]  That's the greatest honor in my life.
[03:31:49.307 --> 03:31:51.768]  It's the greatest thing in my life next to my children.
[03:31:52.728 --> 03:31:57.270]  That I'm real, I'm all in, and you know me by my enemies, and I know our audience of activists.
[03:31:57.850 --> 03:32:02.831]  It's you they hate because they don't have your will, they don't have your soul, they don't have your heart.
[03:32:03.052 --> 03:32:04.572]  They don't control your destiny!
[03:32:05.092 --> 03:32:06.813]  They sure as hell don't control mine!
[03:32:08.049 --> 03:32:11.773]  So we're trying to hold the dam against the Satanists and the armies of hell.
[03:32:11.973 --> 03:32:17.580]  We pray to Jesus Christ and our Heavenly Father to lead God and direct us against this enemy!
[03:32:18.220 --> 03:32:19.962]  But I need money to fight a war!
[03:32:20.162 --> 03:32:21.184]  And I need word of mouth!
[03:32:21.424 --> 03:32:22.285]  And I need prayer!
[03:32:22.485 --> 03:32:23.406]  And I need action!
[03:32:23.827 --> 03:32:25.348]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[03:32:26.209 --> 03:32:27.730]  That dam's already got holes in it.
[03:32:28.230 --> 03:32:32.233]  And the enemy's telling you, don't stick your fingers in it, don't block it, everything's fine.
[03:32:32.433 --> 03:32:34.494]  Peaches and cream are on the other side.
[03:32:34.714 --> 03:32:35.294]  No!
[03:32:35.775 --> 03:32:37.596]  You know it's not peaches and cream!
[03:32:37.796 --> 03:32:39.757]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[03:32:40.558 --> 03:32:41.478]  One way or another!
[03:32:42.559 --> 03:32:47.742]  Only question is, do we have a president in the middle of the fight against the new world order, or is it going to be us that does it?
[03:32:48.362 --> 03:32:49.603]  But we know we're not giving up!
[03:32:51.621 --> 03:32:54.202]  Get the money to us now so we can operate.
[03:32:54.262 --> 03:32:55.702]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:32:55.902 --> 03:32:59.603]  You can also donate at InfoWarsTore.com in the Support Us section.
[03:33:05.065 --> 03:33:10.967]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:21.069 --> 03:33:22.331]  The bell is tolling.
[03:33:23.492 --> 03:33:25.635]  Humanity is at the crossroads.
[03:33:25.695 --> 03:33:28.919]  We're going to win.
[03:33:29.279 --> 03:33:30.481]  But it's going to be rough.
[03:33:30.501 --> 03:33:34.265]  I remember David Einstein in 2005 on my show.
[03:33:34.345 --> 03:33:38.571]  He was saying, I think around 2016 will be a giant awakening.
[03:33:40.035 --> 03:33:42.436]  But then by 2020, the real fight will come.
[03:33:43.036 --> 03:33:48.239]  And if humanity can make it through that in the next 5-10 years, I think there's going to be a real, I mean, amazing time after that.
[03:33:48.259 --> 03:33:49.099]  But it's really up to us.
[03:33:49.119 --> 03:33:51.460]  I remember saying, well, why are you coming up with these numbers?
[03:33:51.480 --> 03:33:54.361]  And he said, well, I do a lot of research, but also I'm just hooked into the universe.
[03:33:54.401 --> 03:33:56.162]  Well, that all played out exactly as he said.
[03:33:56.422 --> 03:33:57.362]  Not just here, but around the world.
[03:33:57.382 --> 03:34:00.404]  The big move against globalism, the big awakening, they counterstrike.
[03:34:01.264 --> 03:34:04.827]  Go back to that, David, come on, I've answered this question before and you won't answer it.
[03:34:05.147 --> 03:34:19.359]  Go back to the moment, you're on my show, you said it a bunch of other places too, and you just said, I just envisioned 2016, the global awakening, the tide begins to turn, but then the enemy by 2020 comes back in to be a big fight, but we're going to win.
[03:34:19.919 --> 03:34:21.220]  Go back to that thought process.
[03:34:23.882 --> 03:34:30.588]  Well, it was, if you go back to when I started 30 years ago, I mean, you couldn't get, you couldn't fill a phone box with interest in this stuff.
[03:34:31.505 --> 03:34:46.157]  But as the years have unfolded, what's happened is people's experience, and people's view of the world, and lots of other things that are going on, have started to break down this, if you like, this bubble.
[03:34:46.757 --> 03:34:50.160]  And people have started to see and look at the world in a different way.
[03:34:50.180 --> 03:34:51.902]  And you know, you've seen a difference.
[03:34:52.002 --> 03:34:55.925]  I've seen a staggering difference in the last few years.
[03:34:55.945 --> 03:34:58.947]  And now they tell us openly, you're only safe in the bubble.
[03:34:58.967 --> 03:34:59.488]  Please continue.
[03:35:00.188 --> 03:35:00.368]  Yeah.
[03:35:02.942 --> 03:35:06.284]  It's not just the numbers of people that are waking up.
[03:35:06.765 --> 03:35:13.589]  It's the type of people, system people, are starting to wake up from within the system and realize what they've been part of.
[03:35:13.649 --> 03:35:14.350]  Oh, that's key.
[03:35:14.430 --> 03:35:16.731]  I think I wanted to ask you this when I was trying to get you on a week's ago, but you couldn't.
[03:35:17.412 --> 03:35:18.833]  Bill Gates was on with Anderson Cooper.
[03:35:18.873 --> 03:35:20.134]  I'm sure you saw it about a month ago.
[03:35:20.594 --> 03:35:25.577]  And they go, yeah, millions of people an hour are saying bad things about Bill Gates.
[03:35:26.058 --> 03:35:27.779]  And they go, and it's not the normal types.
[03:35:27.859 --> 03:35:29.220]  You know the ones, don't know about us.
[03:35:29.600 --> 03:35:30.921]  It's like regular people.
[03:35:31.201 --> 03:35:32.522]  It's people in the system.
[03:35:33.162 --> 03:35:35.664]  So what you just said is they're hitting the panic button.
[03:35:36.585 --> 03:35:40.728]  Which is an expression of what I'm talking about.
[03:35:40.828 --> 03:35:48.213]  I know from people who've contacted me, the kind of people that are waking up now are really in the system.
[03:35:48.493 --> 03:35:54.397]  And they've reached the point where they can't just ignore what they're seeing around them anymore.
[03:35:54.437 --> 03:35:55.878]  We've seen that with doctors coming out.
[03:35:56.578 --> 03:36:04.825]  During this pandemic hoax, but what has happened in this period is a lot of people have fallen for fear.
[03:36:04.885 --> 03:36:20.476]  Yes, and an acquiescence, but it's got so many people off the fence because it's very difficult if you have a smear of intelligence on active duty to look at the world and what's happened and not realize that actually the world is not like you thought it was.
[03:36:21.017 --> 03:36:22.438]  And this is one of the great
[03:36:23.178 --> 03:36:23.859]  Benefits
[03:36:40.405 --> 03:36:43.727]  If they said it was going to come and it's come, it can't be random.
[03:36:43.767 --> 03:36:45.868]  Therefore, what's going on, what's behind it?
[03:36:45.988 --> 03:36:57.334]  And so we're at a point now, a fork in the road, where we are choosing which way we're going.
[03:36:57.774 --> 03:37:01.997]  And acquiescence will just take us where this has been heading all along.
[03:37:02.177 --> 03:37:04.098]  And there's a nightmare down that road.
[03:37:05.160 --> 03:37:11.422]  But non-acquiescence can bring an end to this very, very quickly because it's completely dependent on that acquiescence.
[03:37:12.023 --> 03:37:18.025]  And what we need, ladies and gentlemen, is to move people
[03:37:18.780 --> 03:37:34.467]  From that, I can see it now, symbolically you're on the other side of the street, I can see what's coming next, to cross the street and engage with it, or even more powerfully, to disengage with it, the power of no!
[03:37:34.927 --> 03:37:41.310]  The power of no will bring this down, because the power of acquiescence has built it up.
[03:37:42.219 --> 03:37:44.360]  Our power is being used both ways.
[03:37:44.420 --> 03:37:45.580]  And by the way, I agree with you.
[03:37:45.600 --> 03:37:47.641]  I didn't finish that point, but I agree with you.
[03:37:48.061 --> 03:37:49.161]  This shows how weak they are.
[03:37:49.181 --> 03:37:50.562]  They're throwing everything at us.
[03:37:50.622 --> 03:37:51.802]  I can see their body language.
[03:37:52.263 --> 03:37:54.703]  They are in panic-crazy mode.
[03:37:55.524 --> 03:37:57.764]  And our people never look better, never look stronger.
[03:37:57.824 --> 03:38:00.685]  We're glowing, and it looks like they're diminishing.
[03:38:02.126 --> 03:38:04.027]  Yeah, because they're dependent on us.
[03:38:04.567 --> 03:38:07.288]  And when we stop cooperating with them, they're finished.
[03:38:07.308 --> 03:38:08.108]  They have no power.
[03:38:09.451 --> 03:38:16.435]  And all that's happened in the last few months has simply been through acquiescence of the target population.
[03:38:16.995 --> 03:38:21.598]  No one would be wearing masks now if people chose to not wear masks.
[03:38:21.918 --> 03:38:27.001]  There would be no social distancing, unsocial distancing, if people hadn't acquiesced to it.
[03:38:27.381 --> 03:38:28.782]  There'd be none of this stuff.
[03:38:29.122 --> 03:38:36.806]  It's human acquiescence that's created it, which is great news in a way because it means we have the power to uncreate it.
[03:38:37.307 --> 03:38:37.667]  And you know,
[03:38:38.994 --> 03:38:40.216]  Look at where this is going.
[03:38:40.276 --> 03:38:46.825]  Look how far we've come in a few months and then project that forward if we go on acquiescing.
[03:38:47.361 --> 03:38:49.601]  To where that's going to be by the end of the year.
[03:38:49.621 --> 03:38:50.562]  That's my question.
[03:38:50.782 --> 03:38:52.182]  You talked about the Southern Hemisphere.
[03:38:52.562 --> 03:38:54.662]  They are choking women on TV on purpose.
[03:38:54.962 --> 03:38:57.403]  They're arresting women wearing masks on purpose.
[03:38:57.723 --> 03:38:58.703]  They're beating people up.
[03:38:58.723 --> 03:39:00.123]  They're getting forced inoculations ready.
[03:39:00.163 --> 03:39:02.104]  They're saying, we're going to take your children.
[03:39:02.424 --> 03:39:03.964]  And the UN says it's the model.
[03:39:04.344 --> 03:39:06.904]  I mean, this is... What is wrong with Australia?
[03:39:07.185 --> 03:39:08.765]  I guess it never got to be in a prison colony.
[03:39:09.085 --> 03:39:10.385]  What the hell is going on here?
[03:39:11.645 --> 03:39:14.966]  Well... They're in their winter now.
[03:39:16.718 --> 03:39:28.769]  And what you're seeing in Melbourne and Victoria under this fascist, there's no other way of describing him, Daniel Andrews, the Premier, is what is planned for the winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
[03:39:29.910 --> 03:39:39.198]  And so Australia today, just like China yesterday, will be the West today, as I said, Australia today, Victoria today, is planned to be the West tomorrow.
[03:39:39.458 --> 03:39:41.820]  So how much more are we going to take, ladies and gentlemen?
[03:39:43.138 --> 03:39:50.604]  And by the way, with Matthew McConaughey the other day, I'm sure you saw it, Fauci said, we need to do what China says, they're the model.
[03:39:50.644 --> 03:39:51.665]  How outrageous is that?
[03:39:52.526 --> 03:39:54.108]  Yeah, well, that's the whole point.
[03:39:54.828 --> 03:40:08.421]  See, because this cult has no borders, and one of its great global centers is China, it's no accident this thing came out of China, this whole hoax came out of China.
[03:40:09.221 --> 03:40:24.747]  Because what they've been doing, this cult was behind the Mao Revolution and it has used China behind the wall of that tyranny as an incubator of the global model for total human control.
[03:40:25.367 --> 03:40:31.790]  So it's come out of China, very symbolically and appropriately, this pandemic hoax.
[03:40:32.290 --> 03:40:34.371]  And the crucial element of it
[03:40:35.023 --> 03:40:41.607]  was to make China's draconian lockdown the blueprint for the West's response to it.
[03:40:41.988 --> 03:40:45.290]  This is why, immediately it started in China.
[03:40:45.670 --> 03:40:55.677]  Ted Ross, the deeply, deeply corrupt Director General of the World Health Organization, when he speaks, or moves his mouth, it's Gates speaking.
[03:40:55.737 --> 03:40:56.938]  When Gates speaks it's
[03:40:57.458 --> 03:40:58.399]  The cult speaking.
[03:40:58.679 --> 03:41:02.463]  He came out and said China is the way to deal with this.
[03:41:02.723 --> 03:41:09.589]  And so when it came to the West, the Chinese model, which was the cult model, was imposed on the West.
[03:41:09.849 --> 03:41:11.590]  And what has happened since then, Alex?
[03:41:12.031 --> 03:41:19.277]  The Chinese model of human control has been transferred massively into the West.
[03:41:19.858 --> 03:41:20.919]  And so if you want to see
[03:41:21.699 --> 03:41:29.026]  What's happening in China today and they ain't finished in China in terms of extremes yet either.
[03:41:29.466 --> 03:41:32.088]  So when are you going to do that?
[03:41:32.109 --> 03:41:34.651]  When are you going to react to this?
[03:41:34.691 --> 03:41:35.632]  When are you going to say no?
[03:41:36.778 --> 03:41:39.000]  You know, when we're full-blown China?
[03:41:39.020 --> 03:41:40.020]  How about then?
[03:41:40.040 --> 03:41:41.561]  It would be a bit more difficult then, wouldn't it?
[03:41:42.002 --> 03:41:44.903]  We need to draw the line now.
[03:41:45.624 --> 03:41:47.065]  Use the power of no.
[03:41:47.565 --> 03:41:54.330]  Use the power of collective unity in not standing for it and not having it.
[03:41:54.430 --> 03:41:58.473]  And yes, there'll be challenges.
[03:41:58.513 --> 03:42:00.634]  Yes, there'll be some consequences.
[03:42:00.974 --> 03:42:06.478]  But as the numbers increase, there will be no consequences.
[03:42:07.119 --> 03:42:11.420]  There were no consequences for the thousands of people on the beaches when they declared a major incident.
[03:42:11.720 --> 03:42:12.561]  There's too many people!
[03:42:13.481 --> 03:42:20.383]  We have the power, and their absolute terror is for that penny to drop.
[03:42:20.943 --> 03:42:22.683]  All right, final segment with David Icke.
[03:42:22.723 --> 03:42:25.584]  Straight ahead, the new book, The Answer, at davidicke.com.
[03:42:25.604 --> 03:42:27.205]  I mean, I know that it's linked on the site.
[03:42:27.225 --> 03:42:28.605]  Where's the best place to go to find the new book?
[03:42:30.606 --> 03:42:32.106]  Yeah, go to davidicke.com.
[03:42:33.595 --> 03:42:35.496]  All right, just came out in the last few days, The Answer.
[03:42:35.776 --> 03:42:37.318]  Great cover, great information.
[03:42:37.438 --> 03:42:38.458]  Can't wait to read the whole thing.
[03:42:38.478 --> 03:42:40.280]  We'll be back, and I've got a bunch of my questions.
[03:42:40.860 --> 03:42:44.282]  Just about the general world, the so-called Council of Thirteen.
[03:42:44.322 --> 03:42:45.863]  I mean, how many are really in control?
[03:42:46.604 --> 03:42:48.165]  Because people now are ready to awaken.
[03:42:48.185 --> 03:42:51.027]  I know a lot of this is old news at the end of the night, but what's old is new.
[03:42:51.047 --> 03:42:51.667]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:51.947 --> 03:42:57.091]  Don't forget, the only way this interview gets out on the radio stations you're listening to or the TV stations is to tell people to tune in.
[03:42:57.371 --> 03:42:59.893]  And once it's archived, demand on video to share it.
[03:43:00.313 --> 03:43:01.234]  That's how we win the war.
[03:43:02.176 --> 03:43:11.307]  You know, I sleep really good at night because I do my research and then I come out and I tell you what I actually really believe is going on.
[03:43:11.327 --> 03:43:15.893]  I don't care what the censors or the bureaucrats or the corrupt globalist mafia think.
[03:43:17.035 --> 03:43:20.639]  And InfoWars has become a pro-human, pro-liberty leader.
[03:43:22.458 --> 03:43:24.439]  On the planet, because of your support.
[03:43:24.839 --> 03:43:34.402]  And I just keep coming back to you telling you thank you, because I don't think you understand it's not rhetoric when I tell you you're king, you're key, you're the ether in which we swim.
[03:43:34.802 --> 03:43:35.903]  We are all in this together.
[03:43:36.263 --> 03:43:38.724]  If you don't support Infowars, if you don't spread the word, we're screwed.
[03:43:38.744 --> 03:43:44.226]  Now listen, I gained about 25 pounds in the last two months.
[03:43:45.206 --> 03:43:47.787]  And I said to myself, I am exercising
[03:43:48.963 --> 03:43:51.626]  I am eating as not as much as I even was.
[03:43:51.726 --> 03:43:52.267]  What's happening?
[03:43:52.287 --> 03:43:53.248]  Is it because I'm 46?
[03:43:53.788 --> 03:43:54.629]  About to be 47?
[03:43:55.811 --> 03:43:55.991]  No.
[03:43:57.873 --> 03:44:09.405]  About two and a half months ago, I cleaned off the little side desk in my studio that had my X2, had my DNA Force Plus, had the bodies, had a few of the other products that I religiously take, had the fish oil.
[03:44:10.339 --> 03:44:12.100]  Because it was a big mess, I got mad and cleaned it up.
[03:44:12.840 --> 03:44:15.362]  And so, I went, wait a minute, it's the X2.
[03:44:15.842 --> 03:44:25.007]  Because I remember when I first started taking it seven years ago, how I worked out all the time, swam up to two miles a day, couldn't get down from 280 pounds.
[03:44:26.147 --> 03:44:30.510]  And as soon as I went on good, clean, atomic iodine, it turned out nobody else was selling or had.
[03:44:32.239 --> 03:44:33.361]  I lost like 45 pounds.
[03:44:33.381 --> 03:44:33.901]  Everybody saw it.
[03:44:33.921 --> 03:44:34.542]  It was incredible.
[03:44:35.163 --> 03:44:40.289]  And Dr. Grip told me, he said, you know, those sunspots you get, those will be a lot less once you have iodine.
[03:44:41.531 --> 03:44:45.516]  And what made me notice it was after a few months without taking it, I've been out in the sun, I had sunspots again.
[03:44:47.038 --> 03:44:48.961]  Two weeks ago, I put the iodine
[03:44:50.493 --> 03:44:53.694]  In the studio so that I would put it in the water or take it under my tongue every day.
[03:44:53.714 --> 03:45:00.236]  I started doing it two and a half weeks ago and it was like my wife two days ago goes, man your stomach was like getting really big.
[03:45:00.276 --> 03:45:01.576]  It's gone down like by a third.
[03:45:02.116 --> 03:45:02.737]  What are you doing?
[03:45:02.757 --> 03:45:03.737]  And I'm like I've been too busy.
[03:45:03.757 --> 03:45:06.618]  I haven't been really exercising but I've lost 15 pounds.
[03:45:07.958 --> 03:45:09.439]  15 pounds folks and it's X2.
[03:45:11.119 --> 03:45:12.000]  And again, I get it.
[03:45:12.040 --> 03:45:12.921]  I was never a supplement guy.
[03:45:12.941 --> 03:45:14.203]  It's what listeners want.
[03:45:14.243 --> 03:45:14.823]  People love it.
[03:45:15.104 --> 03:45:15.825]  I have sponsors.
[03:45:16.085 --> 03:45:16.726]  So I sold it.
[03:45:16.806 --> 03:45:21.451]  Then I started saying like eight years ago, seven years ago, why don't I just take what I sell?
[03:45:21.911 --> 03:45:23.553]  And it changed my life because these are really good products.
[03:45:23.573 --> 03:45:26.416]  Because I always got you the highest rated, you know, with sponsors.
[03:45:26.797 --> 03:45:28.038]  So I said, why not put it out myself?
[03:45:31.502 --> 03:45:33.923]  I told the crew, keep it in all the studios.
[03:45:34.363 --> 03:45:35.943]  Remind me to take it every day.
[03:45:36.683 --> 03:45:47.846]  My lord, my libido, my stamina, my eyesight, everything, especially as you get older and you're under high stress, this is the ultimate good halogen that counters the fluoride.
[03:45:47.926 --> 03:45:48.506]  It's incredible.
[03:45:48.986 --> 03:45:51.207]  Now look, it was sold out for months, the X2 liquid.
[03:45:51.367 --> 03:45:52.787]  Let's take it out of the tub.
[03:45:53.447 --> 03:45:54.007]  Proprietary.
[03:45:54.388 --> 03:45:58.090]  It's back in limited supply, but it's 50% off still.
[03:45:58.771 --> 03:45:59.492]  And free shipping.
[03:45:59.592 --> 03:46:02.854]  I'm extending this right through September till it sells out.
[03:46:02.874 --> 03:46:05.376]  It'll probably sell out by the middle of September.
[03:46:05.796 --> 03:46:10.139]  And we have the new Iodine Spray Bottle with X2.
[03:46:10.179 --> 03:46:12.921]  The only true atomic iodine that's in a spray bottle.
[03:46:13.442 --> 03:46:14.062]  It's amazing.
[03:46:14.363 --> 03:46:15.884]  Check it out and all its different uses.
[03:46:16.224 --> 03:46:19.707]  The things it does for topically, but also internally.
[03:46:20.547 --> 03:46:21.828]  It's at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:46:22.248 --> 03:46:23.870]  That's how we finance this operation.
[03:46:24.210 --> 03:46:25.271]  That's how we fund things.
[03:46:25.631 --> 03:46:26.732]  And they're all great products.
[03:46:26.752 --> 03:46:34.977]  So when I promote swearable food, or I promote, you know, that you better get guns because a collapse is coming, it's what I really believe is happening.
[03:46:35.478 --> 03:46:36.959]  And I'm trying to fight the collapse, but
[03:46:37.299 --> 03:46:42.544]  More and more it becomes a reality we better get ready and then hope we've got insurance we can eat the storable food.
[03:46:43.225 --> 03:46:51.193]  This is something that is game-changing and I've got to religiously remember to always take it because every time I turn around I'm tired and fat.
[03:46:51.533 --> 03:46:54.055]  It's because I've quit taking it and gotten out of the habit.
[03:46:54.356 --> 03:46:55.076]  Habituate it.
[03:46:55.497 --> 03:46:56.298]  It's changed my life.
[03:46:56.358 --> 03:46:57.158]  It's changed other lives.
[03:46:57.599 --> 03:46:58.700]  Thousands of five-star reviews.
[03:46:59.000 --> 03:46:59.881]  MFORESTORE.COM.
[03:47:00.081 --> 03:47:01.543]  Get your X2 and X3 today.
[03:47:05.054 --> 03:47:09.140]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[03:47:09.681 --> 03:47:10.983]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:47:38.038 --> 03:47:39.099]  Oh, it's getting nearer.
[03:47:40.641 --> 03:47:41.401]  David Ickes here.
[03:47:41.501 --> 03:47:42.282]  One more segment.
[03:47:43.523 --> 03:47:47.407]  One of the most important, informative people on the planet Earth.
[03:47:48.468 --> 03:47:50.950]  And we're just so blessed to have him.
[03:47:50.990 --> 03:47:54.213]  If he hadn't been there, we would not be in the position we're in now.
[03:47:54.453 --> 03:47:55.134]  We're getting to win.
[03:47:55.154 --> 03:47:56.996]  It's like an arm wrestling contest.
[03:47:57.016 --> 03:47:59.418]  We're starting to push him down, but we can't
[03:48:00.555 --> 03:48:09.463]  I don't think that we have victory yet, and humans have our own problems, but when you come to the realization that every ancient culture was right, there is an evil anti-human force in control.
[03:48:10.043 --> 03:48:15.347]  You know, you have been at the BBC, top TV show, big soccer champion, all that before.
[03:48:15.808 --> 03:48:19.151]  You began to see what was going on, it awakened you, then you had a vision in Peru.
[03:48:19.851 --> 03:48:23.815]  You know, I've had moments of great clarity and understanding where you just are suddenly beamed all this information.
[03:48:23.835 --> 03:48:27.538]  I haven't really gotten into that on air, but that's happened after I woke up later.
[03:48:28.806 --> 03:48:36.293]  So you don't like to talk about the enemy itself and what they do, but you pioneered exposing the pedophilia, the satanism, the adrenochrome.
[03:48:37.614 --> 03:48:45.661]  But you talk about the program public following orders, because they're compartmentalized and manipulated, but there is a large group
[03:48:46.704 --> 03:48:47.084]  That's right.
[03:49:07.392 --> 03:49:14.818]  And so there is that level as well of people that serve it, not out of ignorance, but because they like that force and that energy.
[03:49:15.198 --> 03:49:18.521]  And what can you say about that and how people need to wake up and realize that exists?
[03:49:20.222 --> 03:49:29.730]  Well, we go back to this mind virus, which is actually the consciousness that is totally controlling these people.
[03:49:30.631 --> 03:49:31.611]  And because this
[03:49:33.365 --> 03:49:48.003]  This consciousness is in such an inverted, distorted state, it cannot draw energy sustenance like others can from a balanced state of energy.
[03:49:48.635 --> 03:49:51.756]  Because they're on completely different frequencies.
[03:49:52.296 --> 03:50:09.960]  So to feed itself, to give itself power, to give itself energetic sustenance, it has to feed off energy coming off people that is within its same distorted state.
[03:50:10.000 --> 03:50:15.121]  So that's why in every culture they have to scare people and torture children to death to get that energy?
[03:50:16.172 --> 03:50:28.020]  Well yeah, because what they do is when they put people through these horrific rituals, they're putting them into states of extreme fear, extreme terror, which is what?
[03:50:28.200 --> 03:50:33.023]  It's an extremely imbalanced, distorted state of being.
[03:50:36.745 --> 03:50:42.730]  You go far enough back and they openly sacrificed people to the gods.
[03:50:43.370 --> 03:50:46.933]  And they sacrificed young virgins to the gods.
[03:50:46.973 --> 03:50:48.334]  Well, what was that code for?
[03:50:48.354 --> 03:50:49.515]  It was code for children.
[03:50:49.915 --> 03:50:51.436]  So they were doing it openly then.
[03:50:51.637 --> 03:50:57.201]  And then as humanity grew up and matured a bit, it was no longer acceptable.
[03:50:57.241 --> 03:50:58.362]  So it went underground.
[03:50:58.382 --> 03:50:59.663]  It's still going on today.
[03:50:59.763 --> 03:51:02.265]  All the Epstein stuff, it's all connected into it.
[03:51:03.326 --> 03:51:07.370]  And so they are these sacrifices to the gods.
[03:51:07.910 --> 03:51:18.882]  They are these entities or this ultimately this state of consciousness is feeding off this low vibrational emotion of fear and terror and anxiety.
[03:51:19.162 --> 03:51:26.029]  So if you have a war or you have this virus pandemic scam which terrifies people,
[03:51:26.948 --> 03:51:34.297]  You're creating an energetic banquet for this consciousness which is empowering it.
[03:51:34.777 --> 03:51:43.949]  They want people, the whole structure of society and manipulation is to put the population in these low vibrational states of emotion.
[03:51:44.449 --> 03:51:48.833]  So that they are producing the energy, the frequencies that they can absorb.
[03:51:49.233 --> 03:52:00.902]  This is why when Morpheus in the Matrix held up the battery and said the machines have turned humans into one of these, he was describing in that movie a profound truth of what's actually going on.
[03:52:01.483 --> 03:52:11.791]  So the more we don't fall into fear, the more we come from here and don't fall into these low vibrational emotions, not least fear, which is the foundation of it.
[03:52:12.331 --> 03:52:14.874]  We cease to feed the beast.
[03:52:15.374 --> 03:52:19.017]  The more that we fall into hatred and conflict.
[03:52:19.037 --> 03:52:20.859]  This is why they want people fighting.
[03:52:20.899 --> 03:52:21.379]  No, no, I agree.
[03:52:21.399 --> 03:52:29.066]  So when you were at the BBC at a time that they were sacrificing kids and slitting throats, you didn't see all that, but you heard about it, you said it, years later it was confirmed with the very people you said.
[03:52:29.887 --> 03:52:53.130]  Did you ever see what I've seen, they do it on TV but I saw it some growing up in Dallas, with real satanists when they make that satanic joker face, and a human can't copy it, only the demon shining through can, when you look at the Colbert faces, or the faces made by AOC, or the faces made by Hillary when she's all sharking out, or Newsom makes them but not completely, they make this demon face, have you ever seen that in person?
[03:52:53.936 --> 03:53:04.340]  Well, um, I've seen many faces do many strange things, and the key word that describes them in totality is distortion.
[03:53:05.221 --> 03:53:09.102]  Their faces distort, um, in various, many and various ways.
[03:53:09.323 --> 03:53:16.166]  And you look at, like, the Exorcist-type movie Possession... Well, I'm just telling you, Colbert's a... I mean, that's a devil worshiper.
[03:53:16.226 --> 03:53:17.586]  That's hardcore stuff right there.
[03:53:17.806 --> 03:53:19.447]  That's what a kid sees when they're getting killed.
[03:53:20.205 --> 03:53:27.247]  Yeah, but because this consciousness is actually possessing these people, they're just vehicles for it.
[03:53:27.967 --> 03:53:36.929]  People like Gates and all these other people, they're vehicles for this Wateco consciousness distortion, which we call evil.
[03:53:37.229 --> 03:53:38.450]  That's what evil is.
[03:53:39.210 --> 03:53:40.450]  Evil is this distortion.
[03:53:40.510 --> 03:53:42.511]  It's a distortion of the balance of love.
[03:53:43.011 --> 03:53:44.851]  And look at them, they're all getting high off of it.
[03:53:44.871 --> 03:53:47.092]  They just run around like crazy people when they're doing it.
[03:53:47.992 --> 03:53:51.313]  In my definition, evil is the absence of love.
[03:53:51.834 --> 03:53:54.695]  And you've only got to look at this cult and how it works and its personnel.
[03:53:55.535 --> 03:53:56.675]  They are the absence of love.
[03:53:57.736 --> 03:54:05.419]  And when you go into the biblical concepts of good and evil and, you know, all over the world, every culture, every religion has the same thing.
[03:54:05.759 --> 03:54:12.161]  This is what they're talking about in their different ways and their different symbolisms and their different ways of expressing it, their different names.
[03:54:12.561 --> 03:54:13.702]  They're describing this
[03:54:14.262 --> 03:54:28.173]  Very distorted state of consciousness which is driving and possessing these people that I call the cult, that have been manipulating to create a world that expresses their distortion.
[03:54:29.276 --> 03:54:38.225]  And on the other side, you've got this balanced state of emotion and balanced state of awareness that we call love and harmony and balance, etc.
[03:54:38.245 --> 03:54:45.432]  And these have been the two forces right the way through no new... And that's why they're trying to openly imbalance things.
[03:54:45.473 --> 03:54:49.757]  Big Mike, Michelle Obama came out and said, you know, you better vote for us or we'll destroy everything.
[03:54:50.865 --> 03:54:56.128]  Imbalance and chaos in society is exactly what they're trying to create.
[03:54:58.830 --> 03:55:17.401]  When I study this mind virus, this distorted state of consciousness, I see it in Antifa, I see it in riots, and I see it often in people fighting the people who are within Antifa.
[03:55:18.528 --> 03:55:23.210]  Basically, you have two groups again and again.
[03:55:23.230 --> 03:55:26.411]  It's like a chemistry event that they're clashing us together.
[03:55:27.171 --> 03:55:37.255]  Yeah, wars all over the place are basically different expressions of this mind virus at war with each other because it's creating the chaos.
[03:55:37.315 --> 03:55:38.075]  And that's what I've noticed.
[03:55:38.095 --> 03:55:47.359]  People I know that have been doing good work, they get hit by the mind virus and all they want to do is fight and they make stuff up to fight about instead of just having real order that comes from that pure, balanced state.
[03:55:48.990 --> 03:55:54.673]  Yeah, and so if we want a world of harmony, then we have to be harmonious.
[03:55:54.713 --> 03:55:55.713]  We want a world of love.
[03:55:55.773 --> 03:55:56.534]  We have to be loving.
[03:55:56.574 --> 03:55:57.554]  We want a world of peace.
[03:55:57.614 --> 03:55:58.435]  We have to be peaceful.
[03:55:59.435 --> 03:56:00.956]  I know you've got to go, but do five more minutes.
[03:56:00.976 --> 03:56:03.577]  We've got a few minutes here of the new book, The Answer, David Icke.com.
[03:56:04.078 --> 03:56:06.019]  But the globalists say they're for the environment.
[03:56:06.039 --> 03:56:06.759]  They're the ones killing it.
[03:56:07.039 --> 03:56:07.920]  They say they want harmony.
[03:56:07.940 --> 03:56:08.660]  They're the ones fighting it.
[03:56:08.960 --> 03:56:10.261]  So it's important to explain.
[03:56:10.561 --> 03:56:14.603]  They claim to be doing all the things we really need to do, but they're not.
[03:56:15.664 --> 03:56:17.445]  Yeah, look at that, Alex.
[03:56:18.826 --> 03:56:27.570]  This, um, this state of consciousness that's possessing them, this, this, this, the Wittico mind virus, shall we call it, is an inversion of love.
[03:56:28.290 --> 03:56:29.791]  It's an inversion of balance.
[03:56:30.291 --> 03:56:36.413]  And so everything they do, look at it, in society, you've just described some of them, everything is an inversion.
[03:56:37.694 --> 03:56:43.877]  This is why, if you want to know the truth... That's right, they think they can't do something that's only half an inversion, they only have inversion or not.
[03:56:44.717 --> 03:56:45.957]  Yeah, they invert everything.
[03:56:46.438 --> 03:56:47.098]  So, um,
[03:56:47.879 --> 03:56:55.525]  If you want to know the truth in the society we live in, then basically invert what the authorities are telling you and you'll get very much more closer to the truth than what they're telling you.
[03:56:55.906 --> 03:56:57.387]  Because they invert everything.
[03:56:57.447 --> 03:57:03.091]  This is why they work with unbelievable levels of mendacity.
[03:57:03.131 --> 03:57:06.014]  I mean, if they ever told the truth, they genetically implode from the shock.
[03:57:06.234 --> 03:57:13.920]  It's because it's an imbalance, it's an inversion of balance and love and harmony that is animating them.
[03:57:13.960 --> 03:57:16.102]  So they're going to express that out
[03:57:16.902 --> 03:57:17.542]  I think?
[03:57:39.093 --> 03:57:40.474]  Do five more and we'll let you get out of here.
[03:57:40.514 --> 03:57:42.335]  You gotta come back sooner in these critical times.
[03:57:42.415 --> 03:57:43.376]  It's just such a quickening.
[03:57:43.436 --> 03:57:44.236]  DavidIke.com.
[03:57:44.256 --> 03:57:44.977]  We're so blessed to have him.
[03:57:44.997 --> 03:57:48.098]  I want him to get into the election and what he thinks of Donald Trump.
[03:57:48.199 --> 03:57:49.039]  I respect his opinion.
[03:57:49.279 --> 03:57:49.559]  We'll get it.
[03:57:49.579 --> 03:57:50.280]  Then he'll be gone.
[03:57:50.380 --> 03:57:52.001]  And then John Rappaport takes over.
[03:58:04.960 --> 03:58:05.781]  Man, come on, man.

[03:58:14.798 --> 03:58:17.020]  I want people to listen to me and just come out of your trance.
[03:58:17.220 --> 03:58:21.103]  We have got to realize that we're being conditioned on a mass scale.
