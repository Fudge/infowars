[00:00:09.951 --> 00:00:11.091]  Big Brother.
[00:00:11.091 --> 00:00:12.892]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:12.892 --> 00:00:14.772]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:14.772 --> 00:00:16.493]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:00:16.493 --> 00:00:18.133]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:22.814]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:29.544]  This is Savannah Hernandez for Action 7 News.
[00:00:29.544 --> 00:00:34.307]  I'm on the streets of Austin today to talk about this breaking story from Infowars.com.
[00:00:34.307 --> 00:00:38.970]  Top UN scientists admits vaccines killing people during a vaccine safety summit.
[00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:49.217]  Now, this is a global summit that happened last month in Geneva, Switzerland, where world leaders came forward to discuss vaccine safety and what vaccines really do within our bodies.
[00:00:49.217 --> 00:00:54.961]  Now, this is the chief scientist of the World Health Organization, and she even came forward and talked about how
[00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:58.644]  They can't talk to us about why vaccines are killing people.
[00:00:58.644 --> 00:01:01.046]  They can't give people a specific answer.
[00:01:01.046 --> 00:01:04.108]  Now, we know that the anti-vax movement is one that was really stifled.
[00:01:04.108 --> 00:01:10.754]  Big tech silences them, and they're even silenced in the 3D world when they question vaccines, when they question their safety.
[00:01:10.754 --> 00:01:24.185]  So we're on the streets today to talk to people about that, show them this breaking video, and ask them if they think that the government should be forcing people to have vaccines all over our country, regardless of religious exemption, because we know that is something that has been pushed.
[00:01:24.725 --> 00:01:30.633]  So I'm asking people today what their opinion on vaccines are, if they have any comments on them.
[00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:33.756]  I mean I was always vaccinated growing up.
[00:01:33.756 --> 00:01:36.740]  I'm Mexican so my mom's super hardcore on like
[00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:38.819]  Medication and stuff.
[00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.280]  So I was always vaccinated.
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.081]  I think it's kind of dumb when parents don't do it.
[00:01:43.081 --> 00:01:53.845]  You know, there's those now in age of those parents that like being vaccines are bad, but I think it's I think it's putting your child at risk more.
[00:01:53.845 --> 00:01:56.286]  Oh, do you think that flu shots and vaccines are a good thing?
[00:01:56.286 --> 00:01:58.787]  Do you think that there's something that every American should get?
[00:01:59.349 --> 00:02:00.449]  Well, me, I ain't American.
[00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:01.370]  I'm a Hebrew Israelite.
[00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.990]  I come from the tribe of Judah.
[00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.972]  Like, America is really another slave trade like Africa and when we was in Africa, when Moses came and freed us.
[00:02:08.972 --> 00:02:12.853]  But me, I just stay healthy, mentally, physically, and spiritually.
[00:02:12.853 --> 00:02:13.773]  And healthy, I don't know.
[00:02:13.773 --> 00:02:16.734]  I just eat good and, you know, that's it.
[00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:20.755]  But flu shots, I really don't even care about that because I live my life off of nature.
[00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:25.217]  Big fan of vaccines, would not be here without them.
[00:02:25.217 --> 00:02:30.920]  I have not gotten my flu shot, actually, so I don't know, maybe I'll get around to that, hopefully.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.603]  I don't like vaccines because of what I hear, really.
[00:02:35.603 --> 00:02:40.906]  I hear that they're not healthy for us, so that's one of my reasons why I don't do vaccines.
[00:02:40.906 --> 00:02:42.366]  I am not an anti-vaxxer.
[00:02:42.366 --> 00:02:44.888]  I think those people are so ill-informed.
[00:02:44.888 --> 00:02:48.610]  And I think a lot of it, they were listening to some actors that
[00:02:49.616 --> 00:02:52.718]  I was reading this news article.
[00:02:52.718 --> 00:02:54.759]  It's a UN scientist.
[00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:57.241]  I actually have the video if you'd like to watch it.
[00:02:57.241 --> 00:02:58.042]  It's 50 seconds long.
[00:02:58.042 --> 00:03:01.624]  But she comes forward and says that there are deaths related to vaccines.
[00:03:01.624 --> 00:03:04.766]  There are long term effects that haven't been researched just yet.
[00:03:04.766 --> 00:03:06.287]  Would you like to see the video?
[00:03:20.176 --> 00:03:22.658]  Vaccines and what they do, so this is good.
[00:03:22.658 --> 00:03:23.898]  Let's watch this.
[00:03:23.898 --> 00:03:26.239]  Vaccines are very safe.
[00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:45.129]  If someone gets sick after vaccination, it is usually either a coincidence, an error in administering the vaccine, or very rarely a problem with the vaccine itself.
[00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:46.510]  We really don't have very good
[00:03:47.102 --> 00:04:03.733]  Safety monitoring systems in many countries and this adds to the miscommunication and the misapprehensions because we're not able to give clear-cut answers when people ask questions about the deaths that have occurred due to particular vaccine and this always gets blown up in the media.
[00:04:03.733 --> 00:04:08.796]  One should be able to give a very factual account of what exactly has happened and what the cause of
[00:04:09.508 --> 00:04:13.009]  That's how, but in most cases, there's some obfuscation at that level.
[00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:17.289]  She's confirming what I just said, you know, that are not healthy for us.
[00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:19.410]  And I really don't do vaccines.
[00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.610]  I really take the Echinacea or whatever you call that herb, you know.
[00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.551]  But that's about the best I can say about the vaccines.
[00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:29.551]  I just grew up thinking vaccines were a good thing.
[00:04:29.551 --> 00:04:31.912]  And obviously, I'm not going to base anything off of that.
[00:04:31.912 --> 00:04:35.993]  But that just like that now is leading me to do more research.
[00:04:35.993 --> 00:04:38.293]  And now that intrigues me a little bit more about like,
[00:04:39.164 --> 00:04:39.764]  Hey, you there.
[00:04:39.764 --> 00:04:40.585]  We have a problem.
[00:04:40.585 --> 00:04:41.965]  You see, there is a baby.
[00:05:05.478 --> 00:05:09.360]  The mother of this baby is not sure she's ready.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.463]  The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down.
[00:05:13.463 --> 00:05:16.265]  The mother starts to have regrets.
[00:05:16.265 --> 00:05:20.027]  The father considers leaving town.
[00:05:20.027 --> 00:05:23.369]  But a friend says there's a solution.
[00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:27.491]  She says to have an abortion.
[00:05:27.491 --> 00:05:29.412]  The mother decides to look into it.
[00:05:29.412 --> 00:05:31.434]  The clinic assures her it's safe.
[00:05:32.472 --> 00:05:34.252]  She's made her decision.
[00:05:34.252 --> 00:05:36.753]  She's going to have an abortion.
[00:05:36.753 --> 00:05:43.034]  The problem is, that baby is you.
[00:05:43.034 --> 00:05:52.057]  Join me, Owen Schroyer, at the March for Life, Friday, January 24th, in Washington, D.C., noon, at the National Mall.
[00:05:52.057 --> 00:05:53.197]  I'll see you there.
[00:05:53.197 --> 00:05:55.637]  It's time to stand up for the unborn.
[00:05:55.637 --> 00:05:57.638]  It's time to speak out for the voiceless.
[00:06:08.024 --> 00:06:09.285]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:06:09.285 --> 00:06:11.328]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:56.334]  Project Veritas has just released in the last 30 minutes information that we are about to air for you.
[00:06:56.334 --> 00:07:01.737]  I'm actually late getting on air because I was reviewing it and getting documentation together.
[00:07:01.737 --> 00:07:15.884]  This information that Project Veritas has obtained in an ocean of bombshells that they have released is the most important thing ever.
[00:07:16.772 --> 00:07:19.875]  Discovered by Veritas.
[00:07:19.875 --> 00:07:23.138]  And that's saying a lot.
[00:07:23.138 --> 00:07:27.802]  But only if we realize what we're looking at.
[00:07:27.802 --> 00:07:32.407]  And I'm getting really hardcore chills right now.
[00:07:32.407 --> 00:07:36.090]  There's no way to build this up enough.
[00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:39.754]  It is Bernie Sanders campaign managers.
[00:07:44.904 --> 00:07:46.285]  Multiple ones.
[00:07:46.285 --> 00:07:48.987]  And it's all about to be dropped.
[00:07:48.987 --> 00:07:51.988]  Two minutes have been released so far.
[00:07:51.988 --> 00:07:56.891]  Talking about how they're going to put white males in re-education camps.
[00:07:56.891 --> 00:07:58.692]  And how that's Bernie's plan.
[00:07:58.692 --> 00:08:00.974]  That's what Bernie's told them he's planning.
[00:08:00.974 --> 00:08:08.218]  Now remember, Hillary said we need fun camps for men.
[00:08:08.218 --> 00:08:09.359]  Fun camps for men.
[00:08:09.359 --> 00:08:10.800]  So this is how they introduce
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.702]  Hey, we keep babies alive now and harvest their organs.
[00:08:14.702 --> 00:08:19.745]  At some point, they've just got to get it out there.
[00:08:19.745 --> 00:08:31.793]  They are also announcing programmable cells that they call the first living robots.
[00:08:31.793 --> 00:08:36.936]  And they're admitting that they're going to put them out in the environment and inject them into your body without asking.
[00:08:40.905 --> 00:08:51.649]  So again, that's just more of the mad scientist behavior going on by the globalists with the UN admitting they're not even testing the vaccines they're giving the public currently.
[00:08:51.649 --> 00:08:55.970]  That's all coming up.
[00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:00.812]  The headline on InfoWars.com boils it down for what it really is.
[00:09:00.812 --> 00:09:05.073]  Mad scientists announce the deployment
[00:09:07.416 --> 00:09:13.700]  of programmable microscopic parasites into the environment.
[00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:22.144]  Because that's what they announce is, oh, we're going to release this in the ocean and in the bodies, and it's going to be wonderful.
[00:09:22.144 --> 00:09:25.066]  That's all coming up.
[00:09:25.066 --> 00:09:27.888]  But this is alien life forms being created.
[00:09:27.888 --> 00:09:28.988]  And the scientists say that.
[00:09:28.988 --> 00:09:32.410]  They say, oh, this is alien.
[00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:33.551]  This is not of this world.
[00:09:34.963 --> 00:09:36.704]  Like, is a virus alive or is it dead?
[00:09:36.704 --> 00:09:40.026]  Well, it reproduces.
[00:09:40.026 --> 00:09:42.648]  But it doesn't have some of the other characteristics, so that's an argument.
[00:09:42.648 --> 00:09:47.271]  But what is it when it's a cell that's programmable?
[00:09:47.271 --> 00:09:50.213]  Well, it's a slave.
[00:09:50.213 --> 00:09:56.958]  And it's the overthrow of the biological order in a giant mad scientist experiment.
[00:09:56.958 --> 00:09:59.299]  That's coming up.
[00:09:59.299 --> 00:10:01.340]  And we've got the transmitting of the
[00:10:02.955 --> 00:10:10.258]  Articles of Impeachment, finally, because Pelosi's under so much pressure with her criminal activity, to the Senate, supposedly tomorrow.
[00:10:10.258 --> 00:10:11.238]  I'm going to be in D.C.
[00:10:11.238 --> 00:10:15.240]  with Owen Schroer, Savannah Hernandez, and the crew.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:22.863]  Split between the impeachment trial and Virginia and the gun confiscation the Democrats are announcing they're launching.
[00:10:22.863 --> 00:10:29.325]  So we're going to be covering it all in great detail today.
[00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:48.880]  And then we have the peer pressure brainwashing going on where Vince Vaughn, the actor, shakes Trump's hand at a sports game and the internet's talking about deplatforming him and what a horrible person he is.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:11:00.988]  This is the peer pressure culture of these freaks and their cult of intimidation and bullying and just how dangerous they are.
[00:11:02.537 --> 00:11:07.818]  And then it's also come out that Reuters is secretly a British government front.
[00:11:07.818 --> 00:11:08.679]  I told you that.
[00:11:08.679 --> 00:11:09.699]  That's not even a secret.
[00:11:09.699 --> 00:11:14.220]  It's a tax-free foundation run by MI6.
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.440]  Told you that hundreds of times.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.440]  Now it's been declassified.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:23.322]  We're going to be getting to all of that coming up.
[00:11:23.322 --> 00:11:26.663]  But let me just tell you what we're going to hit when we come back in the next segment.
[00:11:29.855 --> 00:11:39.224]  Not just what Project Veritas is releasing, but what's hidden in plain view.
[00:11:39.224 --> 00:11:49.633]  That the Democrats want to put the Democrat Socialists, the Communist Party, that's what they are, calling themselves Democrat Socialists,
[00:11:52.888 --> 00:11:53.389]  We're good to go.
[00:12:19.531 --> 00:12:25.115]  Doesn't get the nomination and subsequently doesn't get elected president.
[00:12:25.115 --> 00:12:28.497]  You say, oh, let's just talk.
[00:12:28.497 --> 00:12:32.299]  No, when you're hearing this, it's exact battle plan.
[00:12:32.299 --> 00:12:38.303]  And I'm going to play you battle plan from the 70s that the FBI got from the Weathermen.
[00:12:38.303 --> 00:12:40.665]  And then I'm going to play this current battle plan.
[00:12:40.665 --> 00:12:43.086]  And it's the same battle plan.
[00:12:43.086 --> 00:12:44.447]  It's a program.
[00:12:44.447 --> 00:12:45.468]  It's an operation.
[00:12:47.076 --> 00:12:49.578]  That's why Obama put in the Army Manual.
[00:12:49.578 --> 00:12:50.558]  Guys, please print me that again.
[00:12:50.558 --> 00:12:54.120]  I showed it again last week or it's out there in the stack.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:13:00.904]  In 2010, Obama created an Army Manual that talked about how to have re-education camps in America.
[00:13:00.904 --> 00:13:09.650]  And they used the term re-education camp, which again is the Soviet Communist term.
[00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:10.890]  Well, you're going to hear the Bernie
[00:13:13.598 --> 00:13:21.344]  Campaign officials talking breathlessly about the re-education camps.
[00:13:21.344 --> 00:13:25.847]  So this, you have to understand, they're following a script.
[00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:27.768]  It's a formula.
[00:13:27.768 --> 00:13:32.091]  It's an equation.
[00:13:32.091 --> 00:13:36.374]  Like how to get all-in-one pancake mix.
[00:13:36.374 --> 00:13:38.055]  All you gotta add is milk or water.
[00:13:38.055 --> 00:13:40.077]  I mean, it's got directions on the back.
[00:13:40.077 --> 00:13:41.238]  A six-year-old can make them.
[00:13:42.193 --> 00:13:44.915]  And you ask, why would they be running this old play?
[00:13:44.915 --> 00:13:46.416]  Because it's worked everywhere else.
[00:13:46.416 --> 00:13:49.959]  Russia, China, Europe.
[00:13:49.959 --> 00:13:55.783]  And it's a blueprint of what Soros and Antifa and others are planning that we've been warning everybody about.
[00:13:55.783 --> 00:13:58.405]  They want to start a fight with gun confiscation.
[00:13:58.405 --> 00:14:01.708]  They want to start a crisis.
[00:14:01.708 --> 00:14:02.769]  So it's just staggering.
[00:14:05.319 --> 00:14:12.864]  It's absolutely staggering, and then we've got more information on the UN officially admitting that vaccines are killing people, that they're not tested, that they're dangerous, and there's a cover-up.
[00:14:12.864 --> 00:14:18.587]  Boy, that's a mouthful, isn't it?
[00:14:18.587 --> 00:14:20.969]  And, of course, you have that National File article from last week.
[00:14:20.969 --> 00:14:28.934]  Reprint me that as well, where the UN is hiring people for gun confiscation and resettlement, and they went, oh, Snopes, it's disinfo.
[00:14:28.934 --> 00:14:29.935]  That's for overseas.
[00:14:29.935 --> 00:14:31.095]  Well, yeah, and here, too.
[00:14:31.095 --> 00:14:31.556]  It says so.
[00:14:32.509 --> 00:14:38.573]  Snopes also said, we made it up that 189 people have been arrested for arson in Australia, deliberately starting these fires.
[00:14:38.573 --> 00:14:44.177]  That was a direct link to the Queensland police, state police.
[00:14:44.177 --> 00:14:45.678]  You wonder, why do they lie so boldly?
[00:14:45.678 --> 00:14:49.301]  Because this is an enemy attack, folks.
[00:14:49.301 --> 00:14:56.005]  And now, what do you hear the Bernie Sanders campaign operatives saying?
[00:14:56.005 --> 00:14:58.207]  We're gonna burn America down.
[00:14:59.062 --> 00:15:00.783]  And what are the jihadists saying everywhere?
[00:15:00.783 --> 00:15:02.305]  They keep arresting people, setting the fires.
[00:15:02.305 --> 00:15:04.226]  They're Muslims.
[00:15:04.226 --> 00:15:05.147]  And they're communists.
[00:15:05.147 --> 00:15:07.849]  And others.
[00:15:07.849 --> 00:15:10.571]  They always say, oh, but they didn't do it because they're a Muslim.
[00:15:10.571 --> 00:15:12.733]  They didn't do it because they're a communist.
[00:15:12.733 --> 00:15:19.538]  That's who these little disgusting control freak rat monsters are, running around promoting and hyping this everywhere.
[00:15:19.538 --> 00:15:21.099]  So, you can fight back.
[00:15:21.099 --> 00:15:23.161]  They want everybody shut down and silenced.
[00:15:24.417 --> 00:15:27.940]  So when they launch all this, there's no opposition to it, so people don't know what hit them.
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:33.525]  But we're still on air, thanks to you, and we're winning hearts and minds, and we're winning the fight against the globalists.
[00:15:33.525 --> 00:15:34.786]  Not just here, but worldwide.
[00:15:34.786 --> 00:15:38.710]  But that's why they're gonna try to turn the whole chessboard over and go for broke.
[00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.411]  So now is the critical time!
[00:15:41.292 --> 00:15:54.729]  To energize everything we're doing and to spread the word, however you're listening to us, and to spread those links to infowars.com forward slash show, newswars.com forward slash show, band.video and the live feed.
[00:15:54.729 --> 00:15:55.489]  We'll be back.
[00:15:57.702 --> 00:16:08.884]  Attention GCN self-reliance listeners, if you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system but were waiting for prices too crazy to pass up, this will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[00:16:08.884 --> 00:16:18.186]  Bill Hyde here and I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[00:16:18.186 --> 00:16:23.247]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[00:16:23.467 --> 00:16:35.661]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location, and rather than move it back to the warehouse, we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwater's backstory.
[00:16:35.661 --> 00:16:36.923]  So here's what you should do right now.
[00:16:36.923 --> 00:16:38.905]  Check out the PPX Microgrid System
[00:16:39.065 --> 00:16:41.107]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more.
[00:16:57.482 --> 00:16:59.444]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[00:16:59.444 --> 00:17:04.767]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[00:17:04.767 --> 00:17:06.348]  But the symptoms are there.
[00:17:06.348 --> 00:17:14.694]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[00:18:00.843 --> 00:18:03.045]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:18:03.045 --> 00:18:05.066]  Infowarslife.com.
[00:18:05.066 --> 00:18:14.354]  You go to that URL, it takes you to the subsection of infowarsstore.com, where you find the 60 plus products, where we've gone out and researched what is the best,
[00:18:14.994 --> 00:18:16.755]  What gives people the best results?

[00:18:20.457 --> 00:18:25.319]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[00:18:25.319 --> 00:18:28.221]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[00:18:28.221 --> 00:18:29.141]  It's incredible.
[00:18:29.141 --> 00:18:30.802]  So do yourself a favor.
[00:18:30.802 --> 00:18:33.304]  Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[00:18:33.304 --> 00:18:36.165]  You can't lose except if you don't take action.
[00:18:36.165 --> 00:18:43.129]  Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering thanks to your support and God's grace and our action.
[00:18:43.729 --> 00:18:45.010]  But you need these products.
[00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.052]  That's the real reason you want to get them, is because they're amazing.
[00:18:48.052 --> 00:18:51.995]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[00:18:51.995 --> 00:18:55.838]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO, instead of imploding.
[00:18:55.838 --> 00:18:58.600]  We're fighting to win, and we are winning, thanks to you.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.722]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers of InfoWars.
[00:19:02.748 --> 00:19:13.132]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana as a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S., but worldwide.
[00:19:13.132 --> 00:19:19.875]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[00:19:20.655 --> 00:19:30.412]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that and some other areas, but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[00:19:30.412 --> 00:19:33.117]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever.
[00:19:33.971 --> 00:19:39.114]  We really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[00:19:39.114 --> 00:19:44.076]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[00:19:44.076 --> 00:19:46.457]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[00:19:46.457 --> 00:19:52.240]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.221]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[00:19:54.221 --> 00:19:57.323]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[00:20:01.027 --> 00:20:04.148]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:04.148 --> 00:20:20.676]  Bernie doesn't give a damn.
[00:20:20.676 --> 00:20:24.618]  He goes to his second round and he's convinced he can win.
[00:20:24.618 --> 00:20:26.739]  He's not going to walk out of work.
[00:20:30.619 --> 00:20:53.969]  So Project Veritas is set to release videos of Bernie campaign managers over their areas.
[00:20:57.332 --> 00:21:26.587]  Spouting 100% weatherman, communist, re-education camp, overthrow of America, put the white males, because they're Nazis, and you gotta kill a Nazi, that means if you don't submit to whatever their communist demands are, free tuition, free healthcare, free transportation, free to the whole world, knowing that'll bankrupt the nation, if you don't submit to their list of demands, then you're a Nazi and, well, we kill
[00:21:27.711 --> 00:21:28.392]  Nazis.
[00:21:28.392 --> 00:21:38.078]  And what this individual and other individuals on these tapes are saying is exactly what the Weathermen, it turned out, in federal court were planning.
[00:21:38.078 --> 00:21:50.807]  And it's exactly what Bernie Sanders went to the Soviet Union and praised what was going over there, and who went to Venezuela and praised what Hugo Chavez was doing.
[00:21:50.807 --> 00:21:54.650]  And we now know that they have re-education camps in Venezuela.
[00:21:58.291 --> 00:22:04.516]  And he just talks about it like it's a fun thing.
[00:22:04.516 --> 00:22:05.737]  It's a good thing.
[00:22:05.737 --> 00:22:10.881]  Well, look at these documents that Infowars exclusively got that I keep harping on.
[00:22:10.881 --> 00:22:13.003]  Last January.
[00:22:13.003 --> 00:22:18.948]  Documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore.
[00:22:18.948 --> 00:22:23.392]  Using racial strife triggered by Antifa.
[00:22:23.392 --> 00:22:25.713]  And the media hyping up police shootings.
[00:22:26.758 --> 00:22:28.519]  An action plan.
[00:22:28.519 --> 00:22:32.821]  Friends of Democracy, headed up by Alexander Soros.
[00:22:32.821 --> 00:22:34.262]  Same year, leaked U.S.
[00:22:34.262 --> 00:22:39.325]  Army document outlines plan for re-education camps in America.
[00:22:39.325 --> 00:22:41.426]  And here is the document.
[00:22:41.426 --> 00:22:43.648]  People didn't believe it was real.
[00:22:43.648 --> 00:22:45.929]  Later, the Army admitted it was real.
[00:22:45.929 --> 00:22:47.570]  This is what Obama told them to prepare.
[00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:49.191]  FM3-39.40.
[00:22:49.191 --> 00:22:50.271]  Now, that said, let's play
[00:22:57.421 --> 00:23:12.794]  The clip of this Bernie operative that Veritas just released, full video about to be released, talking about the exact textbook, word-for-word, chapter and verse plan for America.
[00:23:12.794 --> 00:23:14.095]  Here it is.
[00:23:14.095 --> 00:23:16.437]  So if Trump gets re-elected, what?
[00:23:16.437 --> 00:23:22.421]  F***ing cities burn.
[00:23:22.421 --> 00:23:23.823]  You would think this would be just like,
[00:23:25.477 --> 00:23:30.982]  Mega people could even be re-educated.
[00:23:30.982 --> 00:23:33.324]  I mean, we gotta try.
[00:23:33.324 --> 00:23:43.011]  So, like, in Nazi Germany, after the fall of the Nazi party, there was a shit ton of the populace that was f***ing Nazified.
[00:23:43.011 --> 00:23:52.179]  And, like, Germany had to spend billions of dollars re-educating f***ing people to not be Nazis.
[00:23:52.179 --> 00:23:52.379]  Like...
[00:23:54.305 --> 00:23:57.789]  We're probably going to have to do the same thing here.
[00:23:57.789 --> 00:24:01.252]  That's kind of what Bernie's like, hey, free education for everybody.
[00:24:01.252 --> 00:24:05.096]  We're going to have to teach you not to be a Nazi.
[00:24:05.096 --> 00:24:09.480]  There's a reason Joseph Stalin had gulags, right?
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:15.886]  And actually gulags were a lot better than what the CIA has told us that they were.
[00:24:15.886 --> 00:24:17.828]  People were actually paid a living wage in gulags.
[00:24:19.099 --> 00:24:21.480]  They had conjugal visits in gulags.
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:23.762]  Gulags were actually meant for like re-education.
[00:24:23.762 --> 00:24:30.345]  Greatest way to break a f***ing billionaire of their like privilege and their idea that they're superior?
[00:24:30.345 --> 00:24:33.247]  Go out and break rocks in 12 hours a day.
[00:24:33.247 --> 00:24:36.629]  You're now a working class person and you're going to f***ing learn what that means.
[00:24:36.629 --> 00:24:36.849]  Right?
[00:24:36.849 --> 00:24:38.490]  Bernie doesn't get to not be something.
[00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:43.813]  If he goes to his second round at the presidency convention, he's going to f***ing go off and do work.
[00:24:48.024 --> 00:25:07.984]  If your speech is calling for the elimination of people based on race or gender or religious, like for whatever reason, like things that people can't change, then you should expect a f***ing violent reaction.
[00:25:07.984 --> 00:25:10.887]  And you deserve a violent reaction.
[00:25:12.495 --> 00:25:15.660]  Be ready to be in Milwaukee for the DNC Commission.
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:20.508]  We're going to make 1978 look like a f***ing Girl Scout f***er show.
[00:25:20.508 --> 00:25:24.695]  The cops are going to be the ones that are going to get you f***ing beaten in Milwaukee.
[00:25:32.324 --> 00:25:37.006]  And they wanted to start at the DNC and then spread across the country.
[00:25:37.006 --> 00:25:38.066]  That's the real plan.
[00:25:38.066 --> 00:25:48.531]  And that's what Alexander Soros and Friends of Democracy documents we got when a family member found these in the individual's home and sent it to us.
[00:25:48.531 --> 00:25:56.574]  And it calls for the criminal activity to trigger a race war and work with the media to get that going.
[00:25:56.574 --> 00:26:00.275]  All I can say is thank God for the Second Amendment.
[00:26:00.275 --> 00:26:01.976]  If that little dirty, stinking,
[00:26:03.066 --> 00:26:03.566]  We're good to go.
[00:26:28.148 --> 00:26:30.589]  If you feel froggy punk, go ahead.
[00:26:30.589 --> 00:26:46.795]  And I'm going to be in Milwaukee at the DNC, and I'm going to be at the RNC, and I'm going to be in DC this week, and I'm going to be there next week when they try to remove our president from office in the Senate trial.
[00:26:46.795 --> 00:26:54.498]  Let's go to Larry Grathwald from the grave, the Green Beret that infiltrated the weather underground and what he said they were talking about in those meetings.
[00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:01.651]  I brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government.
[00:27:01.651 --> 00:27:04.172]  We become responsible then for administrating 250 million people.
[00:27:29.423 --> 00:27:31.704]  And there was no answers.
[00:27:31.704 --> 00:27:34.986]  No one had given any thought to economics.
[00:27:34.986 --> 00:27:38.087]  How are you going to clothe and feed these people?
[00:27:38.087 --> 00:27:49.632]  The only thing that I could get was that they expected that the Cubans and the North Vietnamese and the Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions of the United States.
[00:27:49.632 --> 00:27:55.115]  They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the counter-revolution.
[00:27:56.722 --> 00:28:09.132]  And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[00:28:09.132 --> 00:28:15.417]  Where we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them.
[00:28:16.929 --> 00:28:19.151]  How things were going to be.
[00:28:19.151 --> 00:28:23.474]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate?
[00:28:23.474 --> 00:28:26.596]  That are die-hard capitalists?
[00:28:26.596 --> 00:28:30.659]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[00:28:30.659 --> 00:28:39.086]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[00:28:39.086 --> 00:28:40.807]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[00:28:42.384 --> 00:28:43.947]  25 million people.
[00:28:43.947 --> 00:28:54.106]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia.
[00:28:55.083 --> 00:28:56.905]  Hold it right back, stick with us.
[00:29:24.266 --> 00:29:26.067]  Not a security IPO or note.
[00:29:26.067 --> 00:29:35.572]  Blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.
[00:29:35.572 --> 00:29:36.412]  Don't miss this one.
[00:29:36.412 --> 00:29:37.733]  Stake your claim today.
[00:29:37.733 --> 00:29:38.173]  Call 800-600-3388.
[00:29:38.173 --> 00:29:38.514]  That's 800-600-3388.
[00:29:38.514 --> 00:29:40.415]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[00:29:40.415 --> 00:29:40.655]  Call now.
[00:29:40.655 --> 00:29:40.715]  800-600-3388.
[00:29:40.715 --> 00:29:40.755]  800-600-3388.
[00:29:50.540 --> 00:29:55.362]  I keep my eye on the news all the time, but I miss the fact that in late 2019, just about two weeks ago, the CDC and the FDA approved live Ebola vaccine
[00:30:14.383 --> 00:30:18.846]  To be given inside the United States, and it is an experimental vaccine.
[00:30:18.846 --> 00:30:20.727]  It is live.
[00:30:20.727 --> 00:30:22.748]  It's not even attenuated.
[00:30:22.748 --> 00:30:27.131]  They've just genetically modified it, so it's supposedly not lethal.
[00:30:27.131 --> 00:30:32.835]  Same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly killed and maimed so many.
[00:30:32.835 --> 00:30:35.016]  This is just crazy.
[00:30:35.016 --> 00:30:38.339]  And the Congo's had the biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever since they started
[00:30:39.212 --> 00:30:41.614]  Giving the vaccine there in the last few years.
[00:30:41.614 --> 00:30:46.217]  Oh, and of course, open the borders up here and letting people in unvetted.
[00:30:46.217 --> 00:30:48.639]  The Democrats distribute across the country.
[00:30:48.639 --> 00:30:52.081]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity.
[00:30:52.081 --> 00:30:55.644]  And it is an attempted Ebola assault on America.
[00:30:55.644 --> 00:30:56.885]  This is the new world order.
[00:30:58.237 --> 00:31:04.744]  With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin, it's only natural that it starts to crack and take damage.
[00:31:04.744 --> 00:31:11.491]  Wind, heat, water, and age are telltale signs that it's time to start taking care of your skin.
[00:31:11.491 --> 00:31:18.959]  With the InforWar Super Silver Cream, you can keep your skin feeling silky smooth and begin to heal the damages of the world around you.

[00:31:56.570 --> 00:32:07.395]  I spend a lot of time reminding the InfoWars family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air.
[00:32:07.395 --> 00:32:08.876]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[00:32:09.670 --> 00:32:17.034]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern Paul Revere's.
[00:32:17.034 --> 00:32:24.539]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[00:32:24.539 --> 00:32:33.364]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[00:32:33.364 --> 00:32:37.887]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalists.
[00:32:38.803 --> 00:32:40.524]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:33:30.024 --> 00:33:36.091]  We would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them.
[00:33:37.575 --> 00:33:39.817]  How things were going to be.
[00:33:39.817 --> 00:33:43.419]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate?
[00:33:43.419 --> 00:33:47.262]  That are die-hard capitalists?
[00:33:47.262 --> 00:33:51.305]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[00:33:51.305 --> 00:33:59.751]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers.
[00:33:59.751 --> 00:34:01.472]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[00:34:03.052 --> 00:34:04.613]  25 million people.
[00:34:04.613 --> 00:34:26.281]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational centers, and hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people.
[00:34:26.281 --> 00:34:27.982]  And they were dead serious.
[00:34:34.544 --> 00:34:36.805]  Larry Grathwald was a frequent guest over the years.
[00:34:36.805 --> 00:34:40.306]  He died a few years ago.
[00:34:40.306 --> 00:34:45.649]  His daughter's a patriot, lives out in San Francisco, and he should get her back on as a guest.
[00:34:45.649 --> 00:34:50.411]  But then Obama put it into military code.
[00:34:50.411 --> 00:34:53.672]  I showed you last segment the official Army manual.
[00:34:53.672 --> 00:34:56.173]  We got it from the Army.
[00:34:56.173 --> 00:34:57.354]  For good folks, sent it to us.
[00:35:02.418 --> 00:35:08.482]  For about a month, the media said we made it up.
[00:35:08.482 --> 00:35:11.624]  And that's why they're always demonizing us, because they know we'll put this stuff out.
[00:35:11.624 --> 00:35:13.525]  It's not the army that's bad.
[00:35:13.525 --> 00:35:15.146]  The army doesn't want to do this.
[00:35:15.146 --> 00:35:17.168]  The police don't want to do this.
[00:35:17.168 --> 00:35:20.350]  They're being put in that position.
[00:35:20.350 --> 00:35:28.215]  And now that Obama's out, and he can't have the executive coordinating with the Justice Department and Soros try to cause this,
[00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:31.430]  By creating race war.
[00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:38.512]  That's why you see all the Hollywood movies about white racists being everywhere and about huge explosions and cities burning down.
[00:35:38.512 --> 00:35:41.913]  It's because that's the globalist hope.
[00:35:41.913 --> 00:35:49.095]  Is to have the country and the stock market collapse so Soros can buy it all up with other globalists.
[00:35:49.095 --> 00:35:52.116]  And the people that don't submit, they get put in re-education camps.
[00:35:52.116 --> 00:35:53.577]  They won't be billionaires.
[00:35:53.577 --> 00:35:57.538]  It's the majority of the elite billionaires that are offshore running the scam.
[00:35:58.752 --> 00:36:01.255]  Jeff Bezos is for higher taxes on the middle class.
[00:36:01.255 --> 00:36:04.658]  He just doesn't pay any taxes.
[00:36:04.658 --> 00:36:11.165]  Again, Jeff Bezos, really of the whole crew, is one of the more pro-American ones.
[00:36:11.165 --> 00:36:13.447]  At least he builds something here.
[00:36:13.447 --> 00:36:19.814]  Tim Cook, Apple, all these guys are aggressive, incredibly selfish, worldly, evil people that
[00:36:21.274 --> 00:36:29.679]  Basically run their apple factories like death camps with forced abortions, forced drugging, 18 hour work days when they've got special quotas.
[00:36:29.679 --> 00:36:34.922]  The children put in total squalor facilities, no environmental standards.
[00:36:34.922 --> 00:36:44.768]  But you hear the little pothead, that's what he looks like to me, the bum who goes to the community college and is taught how to hate America.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.422]  Through the big foundations at the government facility.
[00:36:49.422 --> 00:36:59.470]  You can't even understand that that's the globalists putting poison into our veins to get rid of the American system because they don't want other people in the world wanting freedom.
[00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:07.116]  And our system compared to other systems is the gold standard, the platinum standard, the ethereal standard of what we were going for.
[00:37:07.116 --> 00:37:09.317]  This is the place that empowered women.
[00:37:09.317 --> 00:37:12.740]  This is the place started in England banning slavery worldwide.
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:15.142]  This is the place that took on Hitler.
[00:37:18.237 --> 00:37:28.644]  But see, then, by alchemy, we're now the bad guys, according to this guy, and he has the right to, oh, we're gonna put these Nazis in camps, we're gonna kill some of them too, we're gonna kill the cops.
[00:37:28.644 --> 00:37:30.846]  Oh, but camps aren't bad.
[00:37:30.846 --> 00:37:33.007]  Camps are really good places.
[00:37:33.007 --> 00:37:38.291]  Stalin was a really nice guy.
[00:37:38.291 --> 00:37:43.555]  And he airbrushed people out of newspaper articles and photos after he had them killed.
[00:37:43.555 --> 00:37:44.836]  Then they demonized who they were.
[00:37:46.288 --> 00:37:47.009]  Just like they do now.
[00:37:47.009 --> 00:37:49.811]  They make my identity Sandy Hook.
[00:37:49.811 --> 00:37:53.374]  Because the public questioned that, and then I questioned it.
[00:37:53.374 --> 00:37:56.136]  And they said, oh, you hurt our feelings.
[00:37:56.136 --> 00:37:57.057]  You say you think it happened.
[00:37:57.057 --> 00:37:58.959]  I'm like, no, I think it probably happened.
[00:37:58.959 --> 00:38:02.502]  But governments have been caught staging stuff before, so people saw a lot of signs of that.
[00:38:02.502 --> 00:38:03.682]  That's my right.
[00:38:03.682 --> 00:38:08.867]  And as soon as I said, yeah, some of those anomalies aren't correct.
[00:38:10.623 --> 00:38:11.223]  Boom!
[00:38:11.223 --> 00:38:11.904]  That's my identity.
[00:38:11.904 --> 00:38:16.468]  And people are like, Alex, you need to really stop going after the families and talking about it every day.
[00:38:16.468 --> 00:38:22.632]  When it's the media making it my identity and publishing the twisted false statements I never even said in my name.
[00:38:24.008 --> 00:38:38.871]  As a propaganda vehicle, to not make it about the hundreds and hundreds of stories we put out that were game-changing and truthful, and that our main aim is to question everything, and that we've been so successful thanks to you, they can change the narrative to, I'm a guy that bullies dead kids.
[00:38:38.871 --> 00:38:41.152]  People don't know who Adam Lanza is, who killed those kids.
[00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:42.932]  Now, people think I killed them.
[00:38:42.932 --> 00:38:45.453]  It's like, it's the guy, the Sandy Hook kids.
[00:38:45.453 --> 00:38:48.753]  That's how dumbed down they've gotten some of the public.
[00:38:48.753 --> 00:38:50.994]  The public, still thinking, sees right through that.
[00:38:52.114 --> 00:38:58.158]  It's scary how they operate.
[00:38:58.158 --> 00:39:01.701]  And they do it over and over and over again.
[00:39:01.701 --> 00:39:06.564]  That's why they call Trump the racist that said he hates all Mexicans and Mexicans are all criminals.
[00:39:06.564 --> 00:39:09.546]  Never said any such thing!
[00:39:09.546 --> 00:39:13.229]  But they make that his identity.
[00:39:13.229 --> 00:39:16.391]  And a lie makes it halfway around the world before the truth puts its pants on.
[00:39:16.391 --> 00:39:17.152]  To quote Mark Twain.
[00:39:20.287 --> 00:39:23.289]  And these liars, they just love to twist and love to deceive.
[00:39:23.289 --> 00:39:26.131]  But the fact that they are such deceivers is coming out.
[00:39:26.131 --> 00:39:44.966]  And people know ABC News cropped footage at a gun range and said that 10-foot tall explosions of gas cans getting shot by machine guns were 4,000-foot tall red mushroom clouds of a whole town and whole city being vaporized by Trump allowing the Turks to do it.
[00:39:45.746 --> 00:39:47.227]  And they knew what it was.
[00:39:47.227 --> 00:39:50.089]  They went and got the Knob Creek, Kentucky footage.
[00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.950]  They cropped it.
[00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:52.371]  They blew it up.
[00:39:52.371 --> 00:39:56.034]  Look at the stunning mushroom clouds as the town is destroyed.
[00:39:56.034 --> 00:40:00.137]  Thousand-foot flames pour into the night skies.
[00:40:00.137 --> 00:40:03.239]  Trump allows the savage mass killing.
[00:40:03.239 --> 00:40:06.762]  That's consciously lying!
[00:40:06.762 --> 00:40:14.228]  And now, they're talking about how they want to put us in the re-education camps.
[00:40:16.237 --> 00:40:17.358]  And that's what's taught.
[00:40:17.358 --> 00:40:21.681]  Colleges are open-air bullying re-education camps.
[00:40:21.681 --> 00:40:26.785]  That's what re-education camps are.
[00:40:26.785 --> 00:40:32.610]  Abusing some people, not abusing others, publicly executing some, those that turn against you are praised.
[00:40:32.610 --> 00:40:38.875]  It's all a giant peer pressure nightmare middle school where you can get killed if you don't obey.
[00:40:40.194 --> 00:40:49.176]  Amber, you do forced labor all day, but if you grovel to the system, well, then you can be invited into the little communist professor's office and give him a blowjob.
[00:40:49.176 --> 00:40:52.997]  That's what it is to live under a communist system and be a slave.
[00:40:52.997 --> 00:40:57.618]  And China today has millions of Muslims in death camps who did nothing wrong.
[00:40:57.618 --> 00:41:08.081]  Oh, but the left likes that and fetishizes the little dirty rats that work for Bernie Sanders, how they're going to go and run things like a commissar in China.
[00:41:09.144 --> 00:41:16.827]  The scum that burns down the society and lets the communists take over are always the first to be lined up and shot by the communists.
[00:41:16.827 --> 00:41:19.508]  They don't leave little rats like that around.
[00:41:19.508 --> 00:41:22.609]  That guy never gets to run anything or have any power.
[00:41:22.609 --> 00:41:29.271]  He gets taken out to a field and shot in the back of the head and then other people shovel him in and hope they're not next.
[00:41:33.848 --> 00:41:40.715]  You know, those are the rats that'll be out there in the dark of the night with their gas cans burning things down, saying, we're overthrowing the Nazis!
[00:41:40.715 --> 00:41:41.957]  We're overthrowing the Nazis!
[00:41:41.957 --> 00:41:42.898]  Kill the pigs!
[00:41:42.898 --> 00:41:44.800]  I mean, you heard him!
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.642]  We're gonna be killing the police!
[00:41:48.604 --> 00:42:05.895]  All Bernie Sanders is good at is swindling banks and swindling colleges and hiring up to 20 members of his family to all just swindle and then buy expensive, you know, $100,000 sports cars and live in multi-million dollar vacation homes and fly around on private jets.
[00:42:05.895 --> 00:42:13.840]  But he does this and talks about how bad white people are all day, so it's okay.
[00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.863]  Let's play that clip before I have to break, though, of Hillary talking about the fun camps for men.
[00:42:19.206 --> 00:42:24.590]  Because it's a manual from the Weathermen and from the Bernie Sanders people.
[00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:27.872]  This is what they've done everywhere else and this is what they want to do to us.
[00:42:27.872 --> 00:42:36.619]  And they've got your children in school right now brainwashing them and teaching them they're another sex and taking your parental rights away and sterilizing children.
[00:42:36.619 --> 00:42:43.244]  These are abusive tyrants that know old forms of tyranny have been outlawed so they invent new ones.
[00:42:43.244 --> 00:42:47.087]  Oh, it's your son's right at age five to have his testicles chopped off.
[00:42:47.087 --> 00:42:48.208]  We convinced him it's cool.
[00:42:49.062 --> 00:42:50.763]  And he knows best.
[00:42:50.763 --> 00:42:54.004]  We're not perverts, we're not criminals, we're not monsters!
[00:42:54.004 --> 00:42:54.324]  No!
[00:42:54.324 --> 00:42:56.445]  Your child wants to be named!
[00:42:56.445 --> 00:42:59.946]  Hey, you there.
[00:42:59.946 --> 00:43:01.686]  We have a problem.
[00:43:01.686 --> 00:43:04.487]  You see, there is a baby.
[00:43:04.487 --> 00:43:08.369]  The mother of this baby is not sure she's ready.
[00:43:08.369 --> 00:43:12.490]  The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down.
[00:43:12.490 --> 00:43:15.271]  The mother starts to have regrets.
[00:43:15.271 --> 00:43:17.912]  The father considers leaving town.
[00:43:19.039 --> 00:43:22.362]  But a friend says there's a solution.
[00:43:22.362 --> 00:43:26.506]  She says to have an abortion.
[00:43:26.506 --> 00:43:28.408]  The mother decides to look into it.
[00:43:28.408 --> 00:43:31.491]  The clinic assures her it's safe.
[00:43:31.491 --> 00:43:33.272]  She's made her decision.
[00:43:33.272 --> 00:43:35.775]  She's going to have an abortion.
[00:43:35.775 --> 00:43:39.018]  The problem is that baby is you.
[00:43:42.051 --> 00:43:51.074]  Join me, Owen Schroyer, at the March for Life, Friday, January 24th, in Washington, D.C., noon, at the National Mall.
[00:43:51.074 --> 00:43:52.215]  I'll see you there.
[00:43:52.215 --> 00:43:54.656]  It's time to stand up for the unborn.
[00:43:54.656 --> 00:43:58.057]  It's time to speak out for the voiceless.
[00:43:58.057 --> 00:43:59.918]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[00:43:59.918 --> 00:44:01.738]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[00:44:01.738 --> 00:44:05.280]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs, spiritually.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.320]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:08.881]  There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[00:44:10.498 --> 00:44:13.840]  In a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:25.148]  Your bang for your buck here gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[00:44:25.148 --> 00:44:26.269]  And so it's very simple.
[00:44:26.269 --> 00:44:28.610]  If you don't want to be slaves and you want...
[00:44:40.418 --> 00:44:41.398]  Knock on wood, I am not tempting fate.
[00:44:41.398 --> 00:44:45.060]  But everybody around the office, especially folks that have worked here a long time,
[00:45:08.467 --> 00:45:11.249]  I've noticed that I really don't ever get sick.
[00:45:11.249 --> 00:45:14.871]  Now, again, I might get sick tomorrow, because I just made that statement.
[00:45:14.871 --> 00:45:16.152]  I'm not tempting fate.
[00:45:16.152 --> 00:45:19.274]  I'll say that again, because I am superstitious when it comes down to that.
[00:45:19.274 --> 00:45:23.898]  I'm very thankful to the good Lord for the Constitution I've been given.
[00:45:23.898 --> 00:45:32.784]  But up until about eight, nine years ago, when I started taking X2 and the products to enforce life, I still got sick every couple of years.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:33.920]  Yeah.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.581]  Three, four years since I've had a fever.
[00:45:54.581 --> 00:45:55.921]  It's just crazy.
[00:45:55.921 --> 00:45:58.802]  So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[00:45:58.802 --> 00:46:04.623]  I want to talk about Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[00:46:04.623 --> 00:46:08.164]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[00:46:08.164 --> 00:46:10.484]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[00:46:10.484 --> 00:46:12.305]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[00:46:12.305 --> 00:46:19.887]  So here I am telling people Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[00:46:19.887 --> 00:46:20.387]  And I'm 45 years old.
[00:46:21.127 --> 00:46:23.108]  And I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[00:46:23.108 --> 00:46:24.789]  And it's fluoride free.
[00:46:24.789 --> 00:46:28.050]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the Coral Calcium.
[00:46:28.050 --> 00:46:31.652]  Because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean.
[00:46:31.652 --> 00:46:36.334]  And the toothpaste, I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[00:46:36.334 --> 00:46:38.555]  It feels so good.
[00:46:38.555 --> 00:46:41.776]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[00:46:41.776 --> 00:46:47.979]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now.
[00:46:47.979 --> 00:46:49.640]  Because I like the way it feels.
[00:47:01.551 --> 00:47:04.213]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:43.984]  It's 11.59 at Radio Free America, and this is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[00:47:43.984 --> 00:47:47.987]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[00:47:47.987 --> 00:47:50.049]  The chair is against the wall.
[00:47:50.049 --> 00:47:52.271]  The chair is against the wall.
[00:47:52.271 --> 00:47:54.272]  John has a long mustache.
[00:47:54.272 --> 00:47:56.314]  John has a long mustache.
[00:47:56.314 --> 00:47:59.176]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans, another day closer to victory.
[00:47:59.176 --> 00:48:03.320]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[00:48:09.187 --> 00:48:11.047]  But they took a lot of people away.
[00:48:11.047 --> 00:48:13.188]  People that they thought were gonna make trouble for them.
[00:48:13.188 --> 00:48:16.389]  People that had guns or things they wanted, they just took them away.
[00:48:16.389 --> 00:48:17.749]  Where?
[00:48:17.749 --> 00:48:19.849]  Re-education camps, that's what they call it.
[00:48:19.849 --> 00:48:28.111]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents, or kids belong to their families, and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[00:48:28.111 --> 00:48:32.792]  I have decided we really need camps for adults.
[00:48:32.792 --> 00:48:36.093]  And we need a set of camps
[00:48:39.333 --> 00:48:42.695]  All persons of Japanese descent were required to register.
[00:48:42.695 --> 00:48:49.979]  Now they were taken to racetracks and fairgrounds where the army almost overnight had built assembly centers.
[00:48:49.979 --> 00:48:53.562]  What kind of a situation in the U.S.
[00:48:53.562 --> 00:48:54.642]  would you see that happening?
[00:48:54.642 --> 00:48:58.625]  I mean we've got a lot of constitutionless and a lot of people that stockpile weapons.
[00:48:59.225 --> 00:49:09.172]  Plus, you have a lot of people that are coming out of the military that have the ability and the knowledge to build IEDs and to defeat law enforcement techniques.
[00:49:09.172 --> 00:49:15.197]  These people are radicalized and they don't support the United States and they're disloyal to the United States.
[00:49:15.197 --> 00:49:19.760]  It's our right and our obligation to segregate them from the normal community.
[00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:29.092]  It's what we're doing here and let's not kid about it.
[00:49:29.092 --> 00:49:34.156]  We're building a domestic army because the government is afraid of its own citizens.
[00:49:34.156 --> 00:49:37.338]  Put your gun down, really?
[00:49:37.338 --> 00:49:42.342]  Rallying patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty.
[00:49:42.342 --> 00:49:44.183]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:49:44.183 --> 00:49:46.305]  Are you some kind of a constitutionalist?
[00:49:46.305 --> 00:49:51.089]  So these people who hold themselves out
[00:49:52.308 --> 00:49:56.374]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:50:15.160 --> 00:50:24.105]  President Trump gives every indication by what he says, and what he does, and what he doesn't do, that he's mean as a wolverine.
[00:50:24.105 --> 00:50:28.588]  Wolverines!
[00:50:28.588 --> 00:50:31.669]  Don't act so surprised, globalist.
[00:50:31.669 --> 00:50:35.471]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[00:50:35.471 --> 00:50:39.414]  Join Vanguard Video, and I will complete your training.
[00:50:39.414 --> 00:50:43.316]  Together, we can overthrow the Emperor and restore the Republic.
[00:50:45.794 --> 00:50:48.615]  That's right, now Darth Vader works for Infowars.
[00:50:48.615 --> 00:50:53.617]  All right, continuing.
[00:50:53.617 --> 00:50:56.618]  We've got so many giant stories right now.
[00:50:56.618 --> 00:51:01.860]  Impeachment articles to be transmitted tomorrow, the trial in the Senate next week.
[00:51:01.860 --> 00:51:02.580]  I'll be in D.C.
[00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:04.101]  with Owen Schroeder covering it all live.
[00:51:04.101 --> 00:51:10.463]  I'm going to get there Friday, taking a good-sized security team.
[00:51:10.463 --> 00:51:13.344]  The folks that are worried about us want to thank the listeners for the support to be able to do that.
[00:51:17.478 --> 00:51:31.172]  With 293 days left before the election, you've got my commitment to work seven days a week because we're at a literal and metaphysical and spiritual and financial crossroads.
[00:51:31.172 --> 00:51:39.241]  Now, they were trying for decades to get the police with ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, brainwashing.
[00:51:40.373 --> 00:51:41.674]  To hate American patriots.
[00:51:41.674 --> 00:51:48.558]  And they even have law enforcement magazines that said, if you see a get us out of the UN sticker on a car, go ahead and just arrest whoever's driving that car.
[00:51:48.558 --> 00:51:51.679]  If you're a police chief, you tell your officers good job.
[00:51:51.679 --> 00:51:53.180]  Just go ahead and take them in for something.
[00:51:53.180 --> 00:51:55.021]  That was a quote.
[00:51:55.021 --> 00:51:55.662]  I'll never forget.
[00:51:55.662 --> 00:52:03.386]  I was in a 7-11 years ago and picked up a law enforcement magazine.
[00:52:05.236 --> 00:52:07.598]  And it said that in the magazine.
[00:52:07.598 --> 00:52:14.263]  I've shown this article on air.
[00:52:14.263 --> 00:52:16.986]  And so that's what this whole plan is.
[00:52:16.986 --> 00:52:19.448]  That's what this whole operation is.
[00:52:19.448 --> 00:52:27.054]  And so they were trying to get it to where the police would go to war with the American people, but instead the police figured it out.
[00:52:27.054 --> 00:52:27.754]  That's what police do.
[00:52:28.749 --> 00:52:32.071]  And I'm not patronizing the police, like, oh, you're so smart.
[00:52:32.071 --> 00:52:33.292]  I mean, seriously.
[00:52:33.292 --> 00:52:41.819]  People know that 20 years ago, I was all over the police in their face because they were being trained in this, a lot of them were buying it.
[00:52:41.819 --> 00:52:48.824]  And I was trying to explain to the police that tyranny comes to our door in a uniform and that we didn't want them to be brainwashed.
[00:52:48.824 --> 00:52:50.885]  And I don't think the police needed me to explain it to them.
[00:52:52.074 --> 00:52:56.161]  Over the next decade, I learned the police were the most awake group out there.
[00:52:56.161 --> 00:52:59.186]  In fact, a lot of them would just go, Alex, I knew this stuff where you were born.
[00:52:59.186 --> 00:53:03.512]  Stop hopping around everywhere and, you know, thinking we're going to go along with this.
[00:53:03.512 --> 00:53:04.053]  So now...
[00:53:06.041 --> 00:53:14.369]  Instead, they want to go with just a race war model and say the police are the enemy to then basically overthrow local governments, have the UN come in, take control of police departments.
[00:53:14.369 --> 00:53:22.676]  That is a shocking statement, but it's the official Barack Obama, Loretta Lynch policy called Strong Cities Initiative.
[00:53:22.676 --> 00:53:29.742]  I can play the videos of her saying, we're going to have the UN run the police boards, not just the feds.
[00:53:29.742 --> 00:53:31.184]  So when you see these videos,
[00:53:32.617 --> 00:53:44.348]  A Bernie Sanders campaign operative saying we're going to put people in camps and we're going to make them do forced labor and we're going to re-educate them and we're going to, you know, kill the cops and all this stuff.
[00:53:44.348 --> 00:53:46.310]  We're going to attack the police.
[00:53:46.310 --> 00:53:49.153]  Understand, it's not just some rogue person saying that.
[00:53:49.153 --> 00:53:54.959]  And the big story is the globalists are really trying to launch this operation.
[00:53:59.352 --> 00:54:01.754]  I haven't played Hillary's Fun Camps clip yet.
[00:54:01.754 --> 00:54:05.018]  I'm going to play that in a moment.
[00:54:05.018 --> 00:54:08.521]  We'll get into all the other big news and open the phones up for the next few hours.
[00:54:08.521 --> 00:54:10.143]  There's so much to cover.
[00:54:10.143 --> 00:54:11.244]  This is a big news day.
[00:54:11.244 --> 00:54:12.125]  Every day is a big news day.
[00:54:12.125 --> 00:54:13.566]  But today is just incredible.
[00:54:13.566 --> 00:54:15.348]  It's incredibly revealing.
[00:54:15.348 --> 00:54:17.610]  And the globalists are getting defeated on so many fronts.
[00:54:19.039 --> 00:54:22.661]  Their main play is to cause race riots in America.
[00:54:22.661 --> 00:54:31.107]  That's why you turn on any TV or any movie you see, it's just solid, whites are all Nazis, they want to kill you, kill them.
[00:54:31.107 --> 00:54:39.332]  And the quote, minorities that I know, almost all of them just see right through it, unless they're college students or in the public schools.
[00:54:39.332 --> 00:54:46.597]  And then it's the white kids that are the leaders of it, because they want to prove how woke they are, and it's a disgusting spectacle.
[00:54:49.363 --> 00:54:52.806]  They want us divided and conquered.
[00:54:52.806 --> 00:54:54.207]  They want humanity at each other's throats.
[00:54:54.207 --> 00:54:56.149]  So here are the documents again.
[00:54:56.149 --> 00:54:56.770]  Justice Department.
[00:54:56.770 --> 00:54:57.891]  Everybody needs to act on this.
[00:54:57.891 --> 00:55:01.654]  Documents to tell plan for civil unrest and martial law in Baltimore.
[00:55:01.654 --> 00:55:04.457]  Triggering race war by George Soros.
[00:55:04.457 --> 00:55:05.698]  Read it for yourself.
[00:55:05.698 --> 00:55:06.578]  Leaked army documents.
[00:55:06.578 --> 00:55:09.141]  Outlines a plan for re-education camps in America.
[00:55:09.141 --> 00:55:10.622]  There is the actual document.
[00:55:10.622 --> 00:55:10.822]  FM3-39.40.
[00:55:15.714 --> 00:55:18.995]  And then how Obama legalized lying to the American people.
[00:55:18.995 --> 00:55:22.056]  ForeignPolicy.com, The Washington Post.
[00:55:22.056 --> 00:55:24.576]  Oh, and here's Reuters.
[00:55:24.576 --> 00:55:28.077]  Reuters is secretly run by the MI6.
[00:55:28.077 --> 00:55:31.138]  And The Hill reports UK government secretly funded Reuters.
[00:55:31.138 --> 00:55:33.578]  They still run it to this day.
[00:55:33.578 --> 00:55:37.159]  Why do you think mainstream media won't report on Epstein?
[00:55:37.159 --> 00:55:40.240]  Why do you think they whitewash it and make it all about 17-year-old women?
[00:55:41.997 --> 00:55:45.641]  You should get in trouble for that, but that's not what real pedophilia is.
[00:55:45.641 --> 00:55:50.866]  It's trafficking women, trafficking children to blackmail people and to take over the system.
[00:55:50.866 --> 00:55:52.768]  That's what Epstein is.
[00:55:52.768 --> 00:55:56.791]  And why do you think Tim Cook and Apple make sure that I'm not on their platforms?
[00:55:56.791 --> 00:56:00.275]  Because Tim Cook runs the biggest slave camps in the world on record!
[00:56:00.275 --> 00:56:03.458]  Tim Cook's a monster!
[00:56:03.458 --> 00:56:04.899]  Tim Cook is an aggressive
[00:56:05.765 --> 00:56:12.987]  Authoritarian, surveilling you and your family, listening to you, watching you, merging Apple with the Chinese Communist government.
[00:56:12.987 --> 00:56:14.867]  And Trump's blocking Huawei.
[00:56:14.867 --> 00:56:17.127]  Well, Apple's worse than Huawei.
[00:56:17.127 --> 00:56:17.447]  U.S.
[00:56:17.447 --> 00:56:22.549]  officials brand possible Huawei 5G rollout in the U.K.
[00:56:22.549 --> 00:56:24.009]  an act of madness.
[00:56:24.009 --> 00:56:24.609]  Why?
[00:56:24.609 --> 00:56:26.669]  Because they can spy on you with all of it.
[00:56:26.669 --> 00:56:29.270]  Well, what the hell do you think any of this stuff does?
[00:56:31.988 --> 00:56:32.729]  We're going to go to break.
[00:56:32.729 --> 00:56:35.974]  I have a very exciting announcement because it's a bestseller.
[00:56:35.974 --> 00:56:39.700]  We need to fund this operation and it's a good product.
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:40.682]  I use it.
[00:56:40.682 --> 00:56:42.525]  Ultimate Fish Oil.
[00:56:42.525 --> 00:56:43.807]  Targeted Release Fish Oil.
[00:56:44.807 --> 00:56:51.592]  This is the best, highest quality we can find from the top maker in the United States, and we private label it.
[00:56:51.592 --> 00:56:55.414]  I could get fish oil for a dollar to a bottle.
[00:56:55.414 --> 00:57:00.458]  This stuff cost us $10 a bottle or more because it's been purified.
[00:57:00.458 --> 00:57:01.678]  It's concentrated.
[00:57:01.678 --> 00:57:03.460]  It's not been homogenized.
[00:57:03.460 --> 00:57:05.061]  It's the best.
[00:57:05.061 --> 00:57:09.284]  And we're selling it right now for 33% off, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:10.672 --> 00:57:16.762]  You can get it right now for $29.21 and we make like $18 on it after all these
[00:57:22.237 --> 00:57:25.339]  That is the highest end official you're going to find.
[00:57:25.339 --> 00:57:28.882]  People mark this up 6, 8 times.
[00:57:28.882 --> 00:57:30.242]  A lot of medical places sell it.
[00:57:30.242 --> 00:57:32.864]  It's not a prescription, but they sell it at the doctor's office.
[00:57:32.864 --> 00:57:33.985]  The pharmaceutical grade.
[00:57:33.985 --> 00:57:37.347]  And they'll sell it for like 50 bucks a bottle, 60 bucks a bottle, 100 bucks a bottle.
[00:57:37.347 --> 00:57:38.988]  And mark it up 7, 8, 9 times.
[00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:39.889]  We're not doing that right now.
[00:57:39.889 --> 00:57:40.009]  It's $29.95.
[00:57:40.009 --> 00:57:41.770]  The best you're going to find.
[00:57:41.770 --> 00:57:42.490]  Back in stock.

[00:57:47.751 --> 00:57:59.462]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan, hate Infowars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[00:57:59.462 --> 00:58:08.250]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us, and they persecute us, and they lie about us.
[00:58:08.911 --> 00:58:13.495]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[00:58:13.495 --> 00:58:19.420]  The globalists have literally sold their soul to the dark side and they do what they do because they're slaves.
[00:58:19.420 --> 00:58:24.504]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[00:58:24.984 --> 00:58:34.913]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs, to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[00:58:34.913 --> 00:58:37.655]  They fear the fact that we are awake.
[00:58:37.655 --> 00:58:40.238]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[00:58:40.238 --> 00:58:43.341]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[00:58:43.341 --> 00:58:46.764]  And that's all we ever have to know, is that God is in charge.
[00:58:49.369 --> 00:58:54.071]  You deserve a deep restful sleep with Knockout by InfoWars Life.

[00:59:51.473 --> 00:59:54.094]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:04.012 --> 01:00:18.665]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:00:18.665 --> 01:00:26.653]  Project Veritas went up to investigate the upcoming DNC and what's happening with Bernie Sanders campaign people.
[01:00:28.564 --> 01:00:31.225]  They're not just planning no borders, no walls, no USA at all.
[01:00:31.225 --> 01:00:50.391]  They're planning to put white men in re-education camps and to attack the police and have that spread to fires engulfing the United States, martial law, and then, of course, throwing white men in re-education camps.
[01:00:50.391 --> 01:00:51.571]  And who's saying it?
[01:00:51.571 --> 01:00:53.712]  A rat-like, oily, white
[01:00:54.608 --> 01:01:05.417]  Miss Grant, who I guarantee you hasn't even moved out of his mother's basement yet, and is just dreaming about how he's going to rule everyone.
[01:01:05.417 --> 01:01:10.821]  How powerful he is, and his big military action against you and your family.
[01:01:10.821 --> 01:01:17.606]  He'll show you when you're in that gulag.
[01:01:17.606 --> 01:01:18.567]  They think they can do it.
[01:01:18.567 --> 01:01:23.691]  Communists killed close to 200 million people in the 20th century.
[01:01:26.923 --> 01:01:29.406]  And the Chi-Coms are killing millions.
[01:01:29.406 --> 01:01:33.590]  It's estimated every few years of their own people now.
[01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:34.711]  And so you think, that's crazy!
[01:01:34.711 --> 01:01:35.692]  That'll never happen here!
[01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:40.177]  Remember how I told you communism was dead?
[01:01:40.177 --> 01:01:42.879]  Now it's all around you and it's the coolest thing.
[01:01:42.879 --> 01:01:47.224]  Half of millennials and national polls want communism.
[01:01:47.224 --> 01:01:49.826]  And they teach in the textbooks that your parents are stupid and bad.
[01:01:50.896 --> 01:02:01.641]  They have children in Germany officially nationwide singing government curriculum that their grandmothers need to die and are pigs because they hurt the earth?
[01:02:01.641 --> 01:02:03.142]  My grandmother is a pig.
[01:02:04.906 --> 01:02:07.147]  They're old, they don't matter, they need to die.
[01:02:07.147 --> 01:02:14.890]  The children laugh, they giggle as they sing in their... They don't sing Christmas carols anymore, that upsets the Muslims.
[01:02:14.890 --> 01:02:25.155]  So, they had to put concrete barriers around any Christmas fairs because those get attacked by the religion of peace, but the children do sing their carols about how their grandmother is a swine.
[01:02:26.630 --> 01:02:29.692]  My grandmother is a pig and needs to die.
[01:02:29.692 --> 01:02:30.032]  How?
[01:02:30.032 --> 01:02:37.676]  And then at the end, the government morphs the children's faces with Greta Thunberg in a deep fake saying, How dare you?
[01:02:37.676 --> 01:02:40.658]  I am here and I will hold you responsible.
[01:02:40.658 --> 01:02:55.687]  Because it's never scary when you're all being censored for promoting basic freedom and liberty and justice and classical liberal values and a mob of leftists like Hitler come to power and start organizing the youth
[01:02:57.773 --> 01:03:04.616]  We'll talk about the environmentalist pigs, and about grandmas dying, and then they giggled.
[01:03:04.616 --> 01:03:06.097]  One grandma got run over.
[01:03:06.097 --> 01:03:08.638]  Ha, ha, ha, ha!
[01:03:08.638 --> 01:03:15.021]  Ah, grandma!
[01:03:15.021 --> 01:03:18.303]  So, that's what's happening.
[01:03:18.303 --> 01:03:19.543]  I want to open the phones up.
[01:03:19.543 --> 01:03:22.384]  I'm going to give the number out at the end of the next segment.
[01:03:22.384 --> 01:03:25.246]  And I want to have first-time callers have a chance to get on air.
[01:03:27.170 --> 01:03:28.410]  I like what I did yesterday.
[01:03:28.410 --> 01:03:36.312]  I just said, call in on any subject you want, and most of the callers wanted to talk about Iran, because that is the big front and center issue that's kicking off.
[01:03:36.312 --> 01:03:37.632]  It could lead to a wider war.
[01:03:37.632 --> 01:03:51.955]  I don't like the Molos, but I got to tell you, you got the Restart Group and other organizations that seem like nice people, that seem to have reasonable plans, modeled after the American system, laudable, that they're taking what Trump said about
[01:03:53.803 --> 01:04:08.293]  Don't harm any Iranians, don't harm any of the protesters, which I agree with, but that's a signal now for groups to say they're going to start striking out violently at the regime, and when the regime strikes back, that's a red line that we then cross.
[01:04:08.293 --> 01:04:19.140]  So there's a big video on Ban.video that Greg Reese did where he translated what the leader of one of the main opposition groups said, one of the only groups that's not Islamic,
[01:04:21.101 --> 01:04:26.885]  That's secular in that it believes people should have freedom and adopt the American system.
[01:04:26.885 --> 01:04:31.868]  And they're saying they're going to start launching violent attacks in response to the violent attacks.
[01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:35.090]  And so the situation is deteriorating very, very quickly.
[01:04:36.485 --> 01:04:49.592]  And so I noticed callers did want to talk a lot about that, but the impeachment going to the Senate, what tricks you think they're going to pull, you know, they're going to launch a bunch of other scandals during the trial to divert from the fact that there was no meat, no potatoes.
[01:04:49.592 --> 01:04:52.493]  It's like that old Wendy's commercial from back in the 80s.
[01:04:52.493 --> 01:04:54.394]  Where's the beef?
[01:04:54.394 --> 01:05:00.737]  There is no beef, not even a... I would thank you for everything you've done for the Infowar, but I know you're like me.
[01:05:00.737 --> 01:05:02.018]  You don't want my thanks.
[01:05:02.642 --> 01:05:06.405]  You want victory over the globalists and these devil worship and child molesters.
[01:05:06.405 --> 01:05:08.586]  And you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[01:05:08.586 --> 01:05:09.787]  And you know what?
[01:05:09.787 --> 01:05:13.069]  I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[01:05:13.069 --> 01:05:17.412]  And it's why M4's has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to...
[01:05:19.676 --> 01:05:27.760]  Focus the people on taking action against the globalists, because I'm committed to a future for humanity, and I know you are as well.
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:35.864]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us, because you are the Infowar, and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[01:05:35.864 --> 01:05:44.548]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family, and from the great crew at Infowars, I want to thank you all because you are the Infowar, and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[01:05:45.620 --> 01:05:47.221]  You have made history.
[01:05:47.221 --> 01:05:49.102]  We have made history together.
[01:05:49.102 --> 01:05:53.684]  Infowars.com only has power because of you.
[01:05:53.684 --> 01:05:55.525]  And I suggest you use it.
[01:05:55.525 --> 01:06:01.268]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:01.268 --> 01:06:05.250]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:33.191 --> 01:06:35.732]  I don't want to interrupt, then I'm leaving.
[01:06:35.732 --> 01:06:36.772]  You've been doing great, Owen.
[01:06:36.772 --> 01:06:38.133]  You're going to finish up with these calls.
[01:06:38.133 --> 01:06:42.495]  And then Greg Reese and, of course, Harrison Smith are going to take another hour of calls.
[01:06:42.495 --> 01:06:44.075]  The crew's volunteered to do it.
[01:06:44.075 --> 01:06:47.496]  So we're here live covering this, hoping everything de-escalates.
[01:06:47.496 --> 01:06:48.757]  So the live coverage continues.
[01:06:48.757 --> 01:06:50.097]  Everybody spread those links.
[01:06:50.097 --> 01:06:52.478]  The Globals are hacking us, trying to shut this down.
[01:06:52.478 --> 01:06:53.219]  Don't let them win.
[01:06:53.219 --> 01:06:53.559]  No BS.
[01:06:53.559 --> 01:06:55.940]  Let me tell you, everything's straight shooting here.
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:58.381]  See, I don't have some Machiavelli manipulative view.
[01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:00.621]  With me, it's all straightforward attack.
[01:07:00.621 --> 01:07:01.762]  That's the real power!
[01:07:02.881 --> 01:07:05.982]  Don't act so surprised, Globalist.
[01:07:05.982 --> 01:07:09.783]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[01:07:09.783 --> 01:07:13.724]  Join Bandot Video, and I will complete your training.
[01:07:13.724 --> 01:07:26.327]  Together, we can overthrow the Emperor and restore the Republic.
[01:07:26.327 --> 01:07:30.448]  It is January 14th, 2020 on this Tuesday Global Transmission.
[01:07:30.448 --> 01:07:32.388]  I want to give the number out for
[01:07:33.612 --> 01:07:36.312]  First time callers to talk about any subject you want.
[01:07:36.312 --> 01:07:53.936]  You agree with me on something, you disagree, you have a question, you want to make a statement on 5G, you want to make a statement on the UN admitting their head scientist that people are dying, that vaccines are hurting people, and they've been covering it up, and there's no testing at their level.
[01:07:53.936 --> 01:08:01.617]  And so the front lines wobbly that the doctors, the majority of them, believe vaccines are hurting people and know they are.
[01:08:05.219 --> 01:08:09.682]  That's why they're trying to intimidate people that question vaccines and point out the dangers and side effects.
[01:08:09.682 --> 01:08:10.823]  That's why they say arrest us.
[01:08:10.823 --> 01:08:13.085]  That's why they say take our rights and our speech away.
[01:08:13.085 --> 01:08:21.771]  But good news, New Jersey vaccine skeptics win as state votes to protect religious exemption.
[01:08:21.771 --> 01:08:29.077]  Yeah, how do you make Orthodox Jews, when it says in Leviticus,
[01:08:32.110 --> 01:08:39.193]  That you shall not put someone else's DNA, someone else's seed, someone else's blood in your body.
[01:08:39.193 --> 01:08:40.454]  That's just common sense, by the way.
[01:08:40.454 --> 01:08:43.936]  You know, I said don't eat shellfish.
[01:08:43.936 --> 01:08:45.697]  Those people ate some shellfish and died.
[01:08:45.697 --> 01:08:50.179]  They're like, well, put a law on that.
[01:08:50.179 --> 01:08:54.581]  New Jersey vaccine skeptics win a state vows to protect religious exemption.
[01:08:58.479 --> 01:08:59.860]  Some states have gotten rid of it.
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:05.423]  Well, it's time to either run for office or leave those states, because this is real tyranny when they can force something into your body.
[01:09:05.423 --> 01:09:10.986]  And after we take some calls, in the last segment of this hour, there's a headline.
[01:09:10.986 --> 01:09:20.972]  Scientists use stem cells from frogs to build first living robots.
[01:09:20.972 --> 01:09:26.816]  Scientists introduced first living robots created by supercomputer, but it's a supercomputer that programs
[01:09:32.827 --> 01:09:41.094]  That programs a cell from a frog.
[01:09:41.094 --> 01:09:51.763]  And if you look at the graphics, it looks just like the graphics from the 1980s John Carpenter Thing remake, whenever the Thing cells are taking over the regular cells.
[01:09:51.763 --> 01:09:57.889]  They look just like that, and they go take over the other cell, and it doesn't look like that cell anymore.
[01:09:57.889 --> 01:10:00.211]  It transmutes back to what the original cell looked like.
[01:10:00.998 --> 01:10:11.284]  And then you watch the computer renderings and actual video of this happening under an electron microscope, and that's exactly what it looks like.
[01:10:11.284 --> 01:10:19.149]  The supercomputer can go in now and gene edit at the level of programming the cell.
[01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:26.934]  And, oh, of course, it's all rolled out by the PR, by MI6 and the CIA, because that's who runs AP and Reuters.
[01:10:26.934 --> 01:10:28.254]  That's been declassified, by the way.
[01:10:28.254 --> 01:10:28.935]  It's not just Reuters.
[01:10:38.018 --> 01:10:43.900]  And they say, oh, we're going to put it in the ocean, we're going to put it in you, and it's going to be wonderful, safe, and effective.
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:47.941]  They're just announcing it, but it's safe and effective.
[01:10:47.941 --> 01:10:51.942]  And how wonderful it's all going to be.
[01:10:51.942 --> 01:11:00.805]  The robots are coming, and they're going to take over a million jobs in the next year, and the establishment doesn't need you anymore.
[01:11:00.805 --> 01:11:03.186]  So kill yourselves, and don't worry, you are.
[01:11:03.186 --> 01:11:06.927]  And they're shipping plenty of fentanyl onto the streets.
[01:11:09.062 --> 01:11:20.725]  And meanwhile, the homeless are taking over elementary schools everywhere, and crapping everywhere, and putting needles everywhere, all over the country, from Austin to Boston, and the left's saying they're allowed to poop.
[01:11:20.725 --> 01:11:37.090]  See, because it's all about you just giving in to the collapse, and taking control of children, and people having no respect for themselves, and just accepting a takeover.
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:41.140]  But humanity is beginning to awaken.
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.561]  Humanity is beginning to fight back.
[01:11:43.561 --> 01:11:46.142]  And that's why they want to take us off the air.
[01:11:46.142 --> 01:11:55.965]  Because we're an example of the American spirit, the human spirit, telling the truth, standing up for justice, and having success doing it.
[01:11:55.965 --> 01:11:57.425]  That's why the establishment
[01:11:59.096 --> 01:12:00.097]  Can't stand Infowars.
[01:12:00.097 --> 01:12:01.818]  That's why they want it off the air.
[01:12:01.818 --> 01:12:04.079]  Because it's a symbol of freedom.
[01:12:04.079 --> 01:12:05.620]  It's a symbol of resistance.
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:07.321]  It's a symbol of justice.
[01:12:07.321 --> 01:12:13.804]  And I was thinking this morning, while I was working out, about slogans for Infowars.
[01:12:13.804 --> 01:12:15.946]  Because you need to be able to really say it all in just a few words.
[01:12:15.946 --> 01:12:21.869]  And you've got that blood rushing through your brain.
[01:12:21.869 --> 01:12:23.250]  You have those great ideas.
[01:12:23.250 --> 01:12:24.951]  Your brain obviously works better early in the morning.
[01:12:27.432 --> 01:12:28.733]  And now I'm trying to think back.
[01:12:28.733 --> 01:12:30.955]  What, what were those slogans?
[01:12:30.955 --> 01:12:33.437]  I was talking to Tim Preget this morning.
[01:12:33.437 --> 01:12:34.477]  I asked him to write some down.
[01:12:34.477 --> 01:12:35.038]  Maybe he did.
[01:12:35.038 --> 01:12:42.283]  Maybe he's coming over during the next break.
[01:12:42.283 --> 01:12:45.826]  What were those slogans?
[01:12:45.826 --> 01:12:48.288]  I remember now.
[01:12:48.288 --> 01:12:54.053]  It was American Rebirth brought to you by you.
[01:12:57.005 --> 01:12:59.797]  The New Renaissance brought to you by you.
[01:12:59.797 --> 01:13:01.825]  Victory over tyranny brought to you by you.
[01:13:03.632 --> 01:13:04.592]  You are the answer.
[01:13:04.592 --> 01:13:05.592]  You are the solution.
[01:13:05.592 --> 01:13:06.893]  You are the resistance.
[01:13:06.893 --> 01:13:12.974]  And everything the globalists do is to demoralize you and break your will and make you feel small and make you feel stupid and make you give up.
[01:13:12.974 --> 01:13:13.694]  Don't do that.
[01:13:13.694 --> 01:13:21.116]  Don't ever commit suicide just because you don't have a good job and, you know, people look down on you or whatever.
[01:13:21.116 --> 01:13:23.776]  Everything's being set up to make you feel obsolete.
[01:13:23.776 --> 01:13:24.937]  You're not obsolete.
[01:13:24.937 --> 01:13:29.137]  You have a connection to God, a connection to the universe, a connection to timelessness.
[01:13:29.137 --> 01:13:30.038]  You're amazing.
[01:13:30.038 --> 01:13:31.338]  The fact that you recognize beauty.
[01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:36.150]  Is a form of worship of God.
[01:13:36.150 --> 01:13:40.393]  The fact that you can see a sunset and know that it's beautiful.
[01:13:40.393 --> 01:13:45.476]  The fact that you can hear Beethoven and know that it's beautiful, it touches your soul.
[01:13:45.476 --> 01:13:55.563]  Is incredible communion with God's creation and with God and is interfacing with the universe and recognizing what's wholesome and good.
[01:13:55.563 --> 01:13:58.064]  That's holiness.
[01:13:58.064 --> 01:13:59.005]  That's righteousness.
[01:14:00.031 --> 01:14:01.372]  What is wholesome?
[01:14:01.372 --> 01:14:02.572]  What is good?
[01:14:02.572 --> 01:14:05.274]  Darren McBreen's grandson was in here the other day.
[01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.475]  Looked more handsome than a Gerber baby.
[01:14:07.475 --> 01:14:08.815]  And I didn't have envy or jealousy.
[01:14:08.815 --> 01:14:11.777]  I actually was just celebrating the fact that they handed me the baby.
[01:14:11.777 --> 01:14:12.717]  They wanted me to meet the baby.
[01:14:12.717 --> 01:14:15.459]  He's seven months old now.
[01:14:15.459 --> 01:14:16.319]  Kellen McBreen works here.
[01:14:16.319 --> 01:14:16.839]  It's his son.
[01:14:16.839 --> 01:14:20.461]  And it just was this handsome, smart baby smiling at me.
[01:14:20.461 --> 01:14:24.443]  And all that goes into that and all the people that come before him.
[01:14:24.443 --> 01:14:25.944]  And it was just a celebration.
[01:14:29.051 --> 01:14:33.633]  That was God looking back at me.
[01:14:33.633 --> 01:14:35.873]  That was innocence.
[01:14:35.873 --> 01:14:44.756]  There's a great line with Robert Duvall in the film The Road Book.
[01:14:44.756 --> 01:14:46.397]  Won the big International Rockefeller Award.
[01:14:46.397 --> 01:14:50.138]  The book's even scarier than the film.
[01:14:50.138 --> 01:14:55.100]  And almost all the children are dead at that point in the future from some type of collapse.
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:57.441]  And Robert Duvall's this old man
[01:14:59.514 --> 01:15:01.395]  It's like the archetype of the wizard.
[01:15:01.395 --> 01:15:03.036]  I'm not sure he's even really real there.
[01:15:03.036 --> 01:15:05.057]  He says, you gotta protect that boy.
[01:15:05.057 --> 01:15:08.638]  Because that's God right there.
[01:15:08.638 --> 01:15:09.419]  That's creation.
[01:15:09.419 --> 01:15:10.079]  That's the future.
[01:15:10.079 --> 01:15:11.400]  Not that the boy was God.
[01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:15.002]  It's not blasphemy, but that youth, that life force.
[01:15:15.002 --> 01:15:16.342]  And so what do the globalists tell us?
[01:15:16.342 --> 01:15:17.323]  Oh, children.
[01:15:17.323 --> 01:15:17.963]  They're crap.
[01:15:17.963 --> 01:15:18.503]  Abort them.
[01:15:18.503 --> 01:15:19.184]  Get rid of them.
[01:15:19.184 --> 01:15:19.924]  Oh, but we love them.
[01:15:19.924 --> 01:15:20.804]  Let us run them.
[01:15:20.804 --> 01:15:22.305]  Let us tell them how to live.
[01:15:22.305 --> 01:15:25.667]  Let us groom them into lifestyles that will destroy them.
[01:15:28.697 --> 01:15:30.879]  Because that's the opposite of God.
[01:15:30.879 --> 01:15:32.341]  He's willing to hurt children.
[01:15:32.341 --> 01:15:35.383]  Jesus Christ said.
[01:15:35.383 --> 01:15:38.026]  I try to find that scene, the Robert Duvall scene.
[01:15:38.026 --> 01:15:41.049]  I guarantee you there's only one little scene with him in the movie.
[01:15:41.049 --> 01:15:42.931]  It's around a campfire with Viggo Mortensen.
[01:15:42.931 --> 01:15:44.672]  I like Viggo Mortensen.
[01:15:44.672 --> 01:15:45.273]  He's been on the show.
[01:15:45.273 --> 01:15:46.995]  I like Viggo because he's smart.
[01:15:48.692 --> 01:15:50.873]  He's a real liberal.
[01:15:50.873 --> 01:15:52.133]  People call him a leftist or whatever.
[01:15:52.133 --> 01:15:53.253]  He's a liberal.
[01:15:53.253 --> 01:15:55.614]  He's smart enough to actually know what this show is.
[01:15:55.614 --> 01:16:01.356]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[01:16:01.356 --> 01:16:06.457]  Now, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[01:16:06.457 --> 01:16:13.899]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[01:16:14.099 --> 01:16:14.579]  We're good.
[01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:33.531]  Each month.
[01:16:33.531 --> 01:16:34.372]  Don't miss this one.
[01:16:34.372 --> 01:16:35.213]  Stake your claim today.
[01:16:35.213 --> 01:16:35.393]  Call 800-600-3388.
[01:16:35.393 --> 01:16:35.613]  That's 800-600-3388.
[01:16:35.613 --> 01:16:36.934]  These valuable lease contracts won't last long.
[01:16:36.934 --> 01:16:37.135]  Call now.
[01:16:37.135 --> 01:16:37.195]  800-600-3388.
[01:16:37.195 --> 01:16:37.255]  800-600-3388.
[01:16:37.255 --> 01:16:38.616]  Equipment offered poses a financial risk to owners.
[01:16:38.616 --> 01:16:40.238]  Consult with financial professionals before purchasing.
[01:16:40.238 --> 01:16:42.801]  Not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.
[01:16:55.154 --> 01:16:58.598]  I'm here with Scott Youseum, founder of OMG Tax.
[01:16:58.598 --> 01:17:03.463]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[01:17:03.463 --> 01:17:09.850]  My team of lawyers, enrolled agents, and licensed tax experts remove wage garnishments sometimes in the same day.
[01:17:09.850 --> 01:17:15.256]  We even have reduced the total debt some of our clients were required to pay through what is known as an offer in compromise.
[01:17:15.316 --> 01:17:17.757]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[01:17:17.757 --> 01:17:19.197]  Oh, can I ever?
[01:17:19.197 --> 01:17:24.338]  We have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS.
[01:17:24.338 --> 01:17:25.119]  Guess what?
[01:17:25.119 --> 01:17:30.160]  The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non-collectible status with the government.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:40.423]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call OMG Tax right now for a free tax-saving consultation.
[01:17:40.683 --> 01:17:40.943]  Call 800-486-8112.
[01:17:40.943 --> 01:17:41.003]  800-486-8112.
[01:17:41.003 --> 01:17:41.063]  800-486-8112.
[01:17:41.063 --> 01:17:41.303]  That's 800-486-8112.
[01:17:58.049 --> 01:18:04.353]  We have a new product, and we got several thousand of these in, and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[01:18:04.353 --> 01:18:15.200]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste, and it doesn't compete with Super Blue that's four to five colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride-free.
[01:18:16.161 --> 01:18:17.902]  The adult or the children's.
[01:18:17.902 --> 01:18:21.465]  These are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers.
[01:18:21.465 --> 01:18:22.366]  People love it.
[01:18:22.366 --> 01:18:30.492]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re-mineralizes the teeth.
[01:18:31.232 --> 01:18:34.013]  Then it has the patented silver sol.
[01:18:34.013 --> 01:18:36.715]  Silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause gingivitis.
[01:18:36.715 --> 01:18:37.535]  This is all proven.
[01:18:37.535 --> 01:18:39.096]  You can make claims with this.
[01:18:39.096 --> 01:18:50.281]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[01:18:50.281 --> 01:18:51.642]  So, we're really proud of it.
[01:18:51.642 --> 01:18:52.562]  It funds the operation.
[01:18:52.562 --> 01:18:54.263]  Infowarstore.com.
[01:18:54.263 --> 01:18:56.044]  That's why we're still on air thanks to you.
[01:18:56.044 --> 01:18:58.926]  Hey, you there.
[01:18:58.926 --> 01:18:59.586]  We have a problem.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:03.441]  You see, there is a baby.
[01:19:03.441 --> 01:19:07.342]  The mother of this baby is not sure she's ready.
[01:19:07.342 --> 01:19:11.443]  The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down.
[01:19:11.443 --> 01:19:14.224]  The mother starts to have regrets.
[01:19:14.224 --> 01:19:18.005]  The father considers leaving town.
[01:19:18.005 --> 01:19:21.326]  But a friend says there's a solution.
[01:19:21.326 --> 01:19:25.468]  She says to have an abortion.
[01:19:25.468 --> 01:19:27.388]  The mother decides to look into it.
[01:19:27.388 --> 01:19:29.409]  The clinic assures her it's safe.
[01:19:30.458 --> 01:19:32.240]  She's made her decision.
[01:19:32.240 --> 01:19:34.742]  She's going to have an abortion.
[01:19:34.742 --> 01:19:41.008]  The problem is, that baby is you.
[01:19:41.008 --> 01:19:50.036]  Join me, Owen Schroyer, at the March for Life, Friday, January 24th, in Washington, D.C., noon, at the National Mall.
[01:19:50.036 --> 01:19:51.197]  I'll see you there.
[01:19:51.197 --> 01:19:53.639]  It's time to stand up for the unborn.
[01:19:53.639 --> 01:19:55.641]  It's time to speak out for the voiceless.
[01:19:59.483 --> 01:20:22.220]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:22.220 --> 01:20:23.181]  You can feel it.
[01:20:23.181 --> 01:20:24.802]  You can see it.
[01:20:24.802 --> 01:20:26.803]  You can taste it.
[01:20:26.803 --> 01:20:27.524]  It's the awakening.
[01:20:28.875 --> 01:20:34.599]  And the anti-human globalists knew this was coming.
[01:20:34.599 --> 01:20:36.480]  They thought they could manage it and contain it.
[01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:39.262]  I can tell you they're losing again.
[01:20:39.262 --> 01:20:41.244]  It's going to be rough.
[01:20:41.244 --> 01:20:52.071]  But if a remnant of humans can make it through what's about to happen with technology intact, and then have good, clean,
[01:20:53.490 --> 01:21:01.557]  Moral technology rolled out, we can do anything and that we will go interplanetary very, very quickly.
[01:21:01.557 --> 01:21:10.664]  And we'll look back on all our technological developments and there'll be nothing compared to what we're about to be able to achieve.
[01:21:12.199 --> 01:21:22.484]  The problem is there is a spirit of evil that is deliberately deploying technology that is bad for us on purpose.
[01:21:22.484 --> 01:21:29.587]  Everything is thought out at the international level and by these large corporate governance combines.
[01:21:29.587 --> 01:21:40.533]  They do the research, they do the deep dives into everything they roll out from decades and decades of
[01:21:42.481 --> 01:21:45.423]  Raw research.
[01:21:45.423 --> 01:21:47.564]  Exploratory research.
[01:21:47.564 --> 01:21:50.285]  That's farmed by DARPA and other combines.
[01:21:50.285 --> 01:21:57.069]  And then that is deployed once it's decided by the corporate combines to be tested on the public at a beta phase and then finally rolled out.
[01:21:57.069 --> 01:22:00.471]  So we're being poisoned, microwaved,
[01:22:01.621 --> 01:22:04.303]  And dumbed down for our extermination.
[01:22:04.303 --> 01:22:06.265]  And they now admit that.
[01:22:06.265 --> 01:22:14.591]  They thought we were brainwashed enough and stunned enough to start the announcements of, soon we're going to get rid of the humans, you're going to merge the machines, you're going to be a god.
[01:22:14.591 --> 01:22:21.657]  And people went, well wait a minute, Alex Jones has been saying that for decades and that doesn't sound too good.
[01:22:21.657 --> 01:22:25.359]  And I hate to cast ourselves here as the saviors.
[01:22:25.359 --> 01:22:26.360]  I'm not.
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:27.861]  You're the saviors.
[01:22:27.861 --> 01:22:29.703]  InfoWars is brought to you by you.
[01:22:31.837 --> 01:22:54.879]  And I cannot overstate the fact of how real this is, and that there's all this entertainment, all these spectrums of garbage, and all these spectrums of disinfo, and that's why they tell you all over the news constantly that I'm the disinfo, and I'm the bad guy, and don't listen to me, because they want you to discount it and never actually tune in to find out that I just want to have a future together.
[01:22:54.879 --> 01:22:55.500]  I love you.
[01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:56.201]  I love myself.
[01:22:57.898 --> 01:23:01.581]  And I have extreme empathy, not out of some goody-two-shoes thing.
[01:23:01.581 --> 01:23:10.067]  Empathy, I'll explain this with a gross analogy, is going to a public pool and taking a dump in it.
[01:23:10.067 --> 01:23:13.610]  Why would you do that?
[01:23:13.610 --> 01:23:15.931]  It hurts you, it hurts them, it ruins the pool.
[01:23:15.931 --> 01:23:20.334]  Why?
[01:23:20.334 --> 01:23:23.417]  Or empathy for the Russians and the Ukrainians when Chernobyl blew up.
[01:23:24.312 --> 01:23:27.434]  Because you instinctively know that's going to hit you too.
[01:23:27.434 --> 01:23:30.896]  But it's in your cells to care about other humans.
[01:23:30.896 --> 01:23:35.299]  Because if you don't have that in your cells, you start killing each other for no reason.
[01:23:35.299 --> 01:23:39.722]  And everything they do is to drum the empathy out of us.
[01:23:39.722 --> 01:23:42.244]  Except when they tell you to turn it on.
[01:23:42.244 --> 01:23:43.385]  When they tell you to care.
[01:23:43.385 --> 01:23:44.385]  When they tell you to get sad.
[01:23:44.385 --> 01:23:49.729]  They'll lie about WMDs on purpose and then kill millions of people.
[01:23:50.899 --> 01:23:56.244]  With sanctions to desert countries that have had their populations explode.
[01:23:56.244 --> 01:23:59.207]  So they import more than half their food and medicine.
[01:23:59.207 --> 01:24:02.791]  And then millions die and they go on TV and say, yeah, we did it on purpose.
[01:24:02.791 --> 01:24:05.574]  Half a million kids out of the two million dead are a good price to pay.
[01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:07.976]  And Madeleine Albright's a wonderful lady.
[01:24:07.976 --> 01:24:10.459]  She goes out in public, the left comes up and praises her.
[01:24:10.459 --> 01:24:11.480]  She's a powerful woman.
[01:24:13.211 --> 01:24:19.799]  I go out in public and people run up to me at leftist events and they scream at me, you're a Russian agent, you're a Russian agent.
[01:24:19.799 --> 01:24:21.662]  Or gay frogs, where's your gay frogs?
[01:24:21.662 --> 01:24:26.568]  Or you hurt the Sandy Hook children, which I never even hurt one child.
[01:24:26.568 --> 01:24:28.691]  The public questioned the big event, I questioned it.
[01:24:32.935 --> 01:24:46.726]  And I'm being punished for questioning events because they lie about stuff all the time in the media and get caught with fake massacres and fake chemical attacks and fake Jussie Smollett garbage and fake Kurdish towns being blown up on ABC News.
[01:24:46.726 --> 01:24:51.290]  It's fake footage blown up of a machine gun shootout.
[01:24:51.290 --> 01:24:53.492]  But it isn't about me being attacked for Sandy Hook.
[01:24:53.492 --> 01:24:54.733]  It's how they just chose that.
[01:24:54.733 --> 01:24:56.054]  They know you care about kids.
[01:24:56.054 --> 01:25:00.638]  So they go, we'll just set kids up against Alex Jones and say he's being mean to kids that I didn't kill.
[01:25:02.449 --> 01:25:10.196]  And then I become Adam Lanza, Alex Jones, Sandy Hook, Dead Kids, Alex Jones, Sandy Hook, Dead Kids.
[01:25:10.196 --> 01:25:15.800]  And that's done to change the subject away from what we're currently covering.
[01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:20.224]  So they can bring that out in the news and republish things twisted.
[01:25:20.224 --> 01:25:24.128]  I never said in my name to hurt me, to hurt you.
[01:25:26.471 --> 01:25:34.934]  So that when you try to tell people, hey, here's a video from Infowars.com of the head UN scientist saying vaccines are killing people, and folks go, oh, that's Alex Jones!
[01:25:34.934 --> 01:25:37.815]  That's fake!
[01:25:37.815 --> 01:25:40.275]  Because ABC News told you so!
[01:25:40.275 --> 01:25:45.057]  The ones that really do fake stuff!
[01:25:45.057 --> 01:25:48.798]  The good news is, it's not working, and they don't know what to do.
[01:25:48.798 --> 01:25:53.099]  Because you see, they think if they can take Donald Trump down, and they can take Alex Jones down, they can take anybody down.
[01:25:53.099 --> 01:25:54.800]  And we come back from break in a longer segment.
[01:25:55.950 --> 01:26:01.153]  I'm going to show you a great example with Vince Vaughn.
[01:26:01.153 --> 01:26:02.133]  Successful actor.
[01:26:02.133 --> 01:26:03.514]  I don't care about that.
[01:26:03.514 --> 01:26:05.615]  But he is funny and he's a producer.
[01:26:05.615 --> 01:26:06.435]  That's interesting.
[01:26:06.435 --> 01:26:08.677]  Because that takes real work.
[01:26:08.677 --> 01:26:09.737]  Director.
[01:26:09.737 --> 01:26:10.958]  But he's a patriot.
[01:26:10.958 --> 01:26:11.798]  I know folks that know him.
[01:26:11.798 --> 01:26:13.819]  He's a libertarian.
[01:26:13.819 --> 01:26:14.700]  He's a common sense guy.
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:15.640]  He's not out to get America.
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:17.381]  He's not a pedophile.
[01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:19.142]  And so Hollywood already doesn't like him.
[01:26:19.142 --> 01:26:20.903]  Even though he's a big earner.
[01:26:22.694 --> 01:26:28.298]  And so he sees Trump at a sporting event, they shake hands, and they're trying to de-platform him now.
[01:26:28.298 --> 01:26:30.199]  What a cult of un-American scum!
[01:26:30.199 --> 01:26:32.061]  That's dangerous!
[01:26:32.061 --> 01:26:41.167]  But the fact that America sees through this and rejects it now is a tipping point, because they believe they're going to bully us and we're just going to totally submit.
[01:26:41.167 --> 01:26:44.970]  But no, more people need to shake Trump's hand, even if Trump was a bad guy.
[01:26:47.179 --> 01:26:48.959]  People should talk to him.
[01:26:48.959 --> 01:26:56.181]  He has a right to be heard, but they want to totally isolate people so you don't even hear from them, so they can lie about you and say what they want.
[01:26:56.181 --> 01:26:57.541]  That's why I had Richard Spencer on.
[01:26:57.541 --> 01:26:58.821]  I don't agree with Richard Spencer.
[01:26:58.821 --> 01:27:00.241]  I don't trust Richard Spencer.
[01:27:00.241 --> 01:27:02.342]  I think he's trying to create a class of civilizations.
[01:27:02.342 --> 01:27:03.682]  I believe he's a foundation operative.
[01:27:03.682 --> 01:27:06.243]  I can't prove that, but that's what he smells like.
[01:27:06.243 --> 01:27:10.223]  But I had him on because you're not supposed to interview people.
[01:27:10.223 --> 01:27:13.204]  Hell, they used to send 60 Minutes over to interview the Ayatollah Khomeini.
[01:27:14.912 --> 01:27:22.818]  They should interview serial killers in prison, but now, oh, you can't interview Alex Jones anywhere because he's the worst man on earth.
[01:27:22.818 --> 01:27:27.642]  According to the Young Turks, they say, I'm the worst person on earth for lying about George Soros.
[01:27:27.642 --> 01:27:31.064]  He was a hero that fought the Nazis.
[01:27:31.064 --> 01:27:33.046]  That's a total inversion of reality.
[01:27:33.046 --> 01:27:35.968]  Snopes, Alex lied again.
[01:27:35.968 --> 01:27:38.690]  There were not nearly 200 arrests of arsonists.
[01:27:38.690 --> 01:27:40.592]  The fires aren't caused by arsonists.
[01:27:40.592 --> 01:27:41.973]  They're caused by climate change.
[01:27:41.973 --> 01:27:43.554]  That's a giant total lie!
[01:27:44.738 --> 01:27:50.083]  The two major states on fire put out press releases saying what we linked to.
[01:27:50.083 --> 01:27:53.727]  We quoted and linked to the state police statement.
[01:27:53.727 --> 01:27:55.269]  That's not fake news!
[01:27:55.269 --> 01:27:58.472]  Saying we're liars is fake news!
[01:27:58.472 --> 01:27:59.913]  But that's the bigger subject.
[01:27:59.913 --> 01:28:03.417]  How dumb do they think you are to try that crap?
[01:28:05.111 --> 01:28:06.471]  Let's see, they don't even show you the Snopes.
[01:28:06.471 --> 01:28:10.313]  They'll just go, oh, according to fact-checkers, this didn't happen.
[01:28:10.313 --> 01:28:24.378]  And according to fact-checkers in Congress, Paul Watson was de-platformed off Facebook for saying that a man ran over people in New York a few years ago yelling Allah Akbar, which he did, and Snopes and others said he was not a Muslim.
[01:28:24.378 --> 01:28:29.840]  He didn't do it for Islam, even though he was a Muslim and did it for Islam and yelled God is great.
[01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:33.922]  Come on, come on, come on.
[01:28:33.922 --> 01:28:35.844]  They'll point it black and tell you it's white.
[01:28:35.844 --> 01:28:37.625]  They'll point it up and say it's down.
[01:28:37.625 --> 01:28:38.506]  They'll say 2 plus 2 equals 100.
[01:28:38.506 --> 01:28:38.726]  It doesn't!
[01:28:38.726 --> 01:28:39.027]  It equals 4!
[01:28:39.027 --> 01:28:40.248]  Your calls are coming up.
[01:28:40.248 --> 01:28:40.488]  877-789-ALEX.

[01:28:40.548 --> 01:28:40.688]  877-789-2539.
[01:28:40.688 --> 01:28:43.671]  First-time callers, coming up.

[01:30:00.258 --> 01:30:02.019]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[01:30:02.019 --> 01:30:03.761]  But I'll be honest with you.
[01:30:03.761 --> 01:30:09.106]  We run, during the breaks, a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[01:30:09.106 --> 01:30:10.988]  So, you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[01:30:10.988 --> 01:30:12.269]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[01:30:12.269 --> 01:30:13.010]  But here's the bottom line.
[01:30:14.025 --> 01:30:15.486]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[01:30:15.486 --> 01:30:18.188]  And I want to expand in the face of the globalists, not contract.
[01:30:18.188 --> 01:30:19.349]  I don't want them to win.
[01:30:19.349 --> 01:30:22.272]  So listen, you've got this guarantee from me.

[01:31:00.038 --> 01:31:01.819]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[01:31:01.819 --> 01:31:13.083]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[01:31:13.863 --> 01:31:22.653]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[01:31:22.653 --> 01:31:33.606]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[01:31:34.106 --> 01:31:36.708]  Pollen block is natural and effective.
[01:31:36.708 --> 01:31:38.429]  It is not an antihistamine.
[01:31:38.429 --> 01:31:48.436]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[01:31:48.436 --> 01:31:51.098]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[01:31:51.098 --> 01:31:56.962]  Head to Infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our Pollen Block Chewable Tablets.
[01:31:56.962 --> 01:32:01.565]  It's either happened to every person listening or it's happened to someone you know.
[01:32:02.626 --> 01:32:16.872]  Everybody is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine right before they get it and that they get the worst case of the flu of their life.
[01:32:16.872 --> 01:32:17.412]  But still,
[01:32:18.325 --> 01:32:25.787]  Like concentration camp victims, they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections.
[01:32:25.787 --> 01:32:36.930]  It doesn't matter that studies, mainline government studies in Canada and Europe show that when you take the flu vaccine, it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your immunity.
[01:32:36.930 --> 01:32:38.451]  It goes on and on.
[01:32:38.451 --> 01:32:46.633]  Or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's mutation, that the flu vaccine has never, ever even worked.
[01:32:47.273 --> 01:32:48.775]  But how do you prop up a hoax?
[01:32:48.775 --> 01:32:51.237]  You keep the giant hoax going.
[01:32:51.237 --> 01:32:58.945]  No wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record happening right now.
[01:32:58.945 --> 01:33:01.588]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:17.498 --> 01:33:22.400]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:27.502]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:27.502 --> 01:33:31.643]  I woke up at 4 10 a.m.
[01:33:31.643 --> 01:33:46.709]  this morning just wanting to get to work and I went down into the kitchen and I like to turn on analog radio and keep the phone away for a while a little tracking device and I turned on Fox
[01:33:48.792 --> 01:33:52.614]  Radio, you know, the local station had Fox News on it.
[01:33:52.614 --> 01:34:01.417]  And it said, coming up, Burisma, the Hunter Biden Ukrainian company, why they got hacked.
[01:34:01.417 --> 01:34:02.558]  And then it went to a commercial.
[01:34:02.558 --> 01:34:05.239]  And I went, they're going to say the Russians hacked it.
[01:34:05.239 --> 01:34:13.803]  Because, I mean, if you're found with dead bodies in your backyard of children and there's video of you killing them, you just say, oh, the Russians hacked my computer and released me killing the kids.
[01:34:13.803 --> 01:34:14.623]  The police will go, well,
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:19.963]  Then you can kill kids then, you know, if the Russians are the ones that discovered it.
[01:34:19.963 --> 01:34:21.885]  Oh, Hillary commits all these crimes.
[01:34:21.885 --> 01:34:30.671]  Well, we think it's the Russians that got the emails, and the Russians that got the WikiLeaks, and the Russians that got the information from the hacked DNC stuff.
[01:34:30.671 --> 01:34:35.654]  Well, they never proved that by the way, it's just made up, but well, it's okay then.
[01:34:35.654 --> 01:34:38.797]  Hillary did nothing wrong, if it's the Russians.
[01:34:38.797 --> 01:34:39.817]  Imagine, you get pulled over.
[01:34:40.728 --> 01:34:46.449]  You've drank a bottle of Jack Daniels, you're totally drunk, and say, Officer, the Russians did it.
[01:34:46.449 --> 01:34:51.270]  And he's like, oh, well, yes sir, the Russians gave me the Jack Daniels.
[01:34:51.270 --> 01:34:54.931]  So there you go, Burisma!
[01:34:54.931 --> 01:34:56.011]  Wow.
[01:34:56.011 --> 01:34:56.791]  Burisma, a U.S.
[01:34:56.791 --> 01:35:00.572]  firm, says Russia hack company at heart of Trump impeachment.
[01:35:00.572 --> 01:35:06.433]  Oh my goodness, the Russians.
[01:35:06.433 --> 01:35:08.633]  But you know, in this case, they might have actually done it, because
[01:35:10.578 --> 01:35:15.140]  Charisma is taking a bunch of the Russian gas and pipelines that are there.
[01:35:15.140 --> 01:35:20.963]  That's why Russia went in to Eastern Ukraine, where Russia was founded 500 years ago.
[01:35:20.963 --> 01:35:23.164]  It's like Boston.
[01:35:23.164 --> 01:35:24.584]  It's like where Russia started.
[01:35:24.584 --> 01:35:25.825]  It's that area of Ukraine.
[01:35:25.825 --> 01:35:29.046]  It's just crazy.
[01:35:29.046 --> 01:35:30.447]  That's in the history books, by the way.
[01:35:30.447 --> 01:35:31.947]  And they said, you're not taking our stuff.
[01:35:31.947 --> 01:35:34.869]  So they probably did hack them, but not for the reason they're saying.
[01:35:34.869 --> 01:35:36.029]  It doesn't matter.
[01:35:36.029 --> 01:35:38.670]  What about the crimes that Hunter Biden committed?
[01:35:38.670 --> 01:35:39.691]  That's what matters.
[01:35:42.688 --> 01:35:48.250]  But that's how they change the subject, time and time and time again.
[01:35:48.250 --> 01:35:51.471]  And again, I'm not a Russophile.
[01:35:51.471 --> 01:35:55.073]  I'm just not a Russophobe.
[01:35:55.073 --> 01:36:00.575]  Well, okay, maybe I'm a Russophile or a Ukrainophile for the women a little bit, but I'm not that looking.
[01:36:00.575 --> 01:36:04.296]  Or, yeah, wherever Melania's from.
[01:36:04.296 --> 01:36:10.098]  Not hard on the eyes, but let's just say I'm not a Russophile when it comes to the men.
[01:36:10.098 --> 01:36:11.199]  But seriously, folks,
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:16.022]  They just treat us like we're morons.
[01:36:16.022 --> 01:36:20.045]  Every time Democrats do something wrong, it's because the Russians exposed it.
[01:36:20.045 --> 01:36:22.867]  Okay, well then thank you, Russia.
[01:36:22.867 --> 01:36:27.150]  I want to get back to the unapologetic Trump.
[01:36:27.150 --> 01:36:29.191]  One that says, I don't know who has the emails.
[01:36:29.191 --> 01:36:33.935]  It may be a fat guy in his mother's basement, naked, on a laptop.
[01:36:33.935 --> 01:36:35.516]  Or it could be the Russians, doesn't matter.
[01:36:35.516 --> 01:36:38.378]  Hillary has illegal emails, 30-something thousand of them.
[01:36:38.378 --> 01:36:39.659]  Whoever's got them, release them.
[01:36:39.659 --> 01:36:40.680]  She committed the crime.
[01:36:40.680 --> 01:36:41.160]  Exactly!
[01:36:42.642 --> 01:36:48.387]  If a kid was kidnapped, would you care if it was the Russians found out who had the kid?
[01:36:48.387 --> 01:36:48.947]  No, you wouldn't.
[01:36:48.947 --> 01:36:52.830]  877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[01:36:52.830 --> 01:36:56.473]  We're going to take your calls on all these subjects, but getting back to Vince Vaughn.
[01:37:02.879 --> 01:37:05.081]  Oh, it's a big national controversy.
[01:37:05.081 --> 01:37:09.683]  Will Vince Vaughn get production or acting jobs or directing jobs anymore?
[01:37:09.683 --> 01:37:14.607]  He's a big earner in Hollywood, but he was at a game.
[01:37:14.607 --> 01:37:17.789]  And, well, you know, he shook Trump's hand.
[01:37:17.789 --> 01:37:19.169]  In fact, let's roll it.
[01:37:19.169 --> 01:37:24.633]  And the leftist that videotaped it said, I'm really sad to have to show you this.
[01:37:24.633 --> 01:37:26.674]  It's just shocking.
[01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:27.895]  What are we going to do now?
[01:37:27.895 --> 01:37:30.757]  Oh, my gosh.
[01:37:30.757 --> 01:37:31.077]  Trump.
[01:37:32.443 --> 01:37:43.887]  And his wife were at this game, and they shook hands, left us on Twitter, freaked out over a video showing actor Vince Vaughn having a 20-second conversation with President Trump before shaking his hand.
[01:37:43.887 --> 01:37:44.428]  Yes, really.
[01:37:44.428 --> 01:37:50.850]  The clip shows Vaughn talking to Trump and First Lady Melania in a private box at the National Championship game in New Orleans.
[01:37:50.850 --> 01:37:53.551]  I'm very sorry to have to share this video with you.
[01:37:53.551 --> 01:38:01.394]  All of it, every part of it, commented former Daily Beast journalist Timothy Burke, who was the first to post the video.
[01:38:02.580 --> 01:38:05.582]  Oh my, but oh, they reported it to us.
[01:38:05.582 --> 01:38:07.964]  There you go, ladies and gentlemen, they reported it.
[01:38:07.964 --> 01:38:17.311]  Meanwhile, Stephen King, savaged by Woke Mob for saying art should be judged on quality, not diversity.
[01:38:17.311 --> 01:38:27.358]  And he complained that he's only up for three awards because you can only have three awards at the Oscars, I guess, for whatever category.
[01:38:27.358 --> 01:38:29.580]  And he says it shouldn't be based on
[01:38:31.283 --> 01:38:38.438]  What color you are, or whatever, or shouldn't be based on how much success you've had in the past, that art should be judged according to its quality.
[01:38:38.438 --> 01:38:38.738]  Really?
[01:38:41.311 --> 01:38:45.293]  That from, in my opinion, the biggest plagiarist that ever walked the face of the earth.
[01:38:45.293 --> 01:38:48.334]  You've read a lot of literature, you know a lot of history, a lot of art, a lot of things.
[01:38:48.334 --> 01:38:52.055]  I mean, if you've read old classics, then you've read Stephen King.
[01:38:52.055 --> 01:38:53.236]  He just changes the names around.
[01:38:53.236 --> 01:38:55.616]  I mean, it's plagiarism.
[01:38:55.616 --> 01:39:05.540]  But I just love this anti-free speech, woke, anti-American globalist, now bitching that, oh, I might only get three Oscars because of the wokeness.
[01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:08.781]  And then Twitter's like, no, you don't deserve anything.
[01:39:11.263 --> 01:39:14.905]  It's a snake eating itself is what it is.
[01:39:14.905 --> 01:39:18.286]  Total joke.
[01:39:18.286 --> 01:39:19.066]  Absolute joke.
[01:39:19.066 --> 01:39:25.689]  I mean, I don't know if you know the stuff that Stephen King says, but it's just disgusting and it's ongoing against this country.
[01:39:25.689 --> 01:39:29.891]  He and his wife and the rest of them make me sick.
[01:39:29.891 --> 01:39:37.994]  So, I mean, they can't even... He couldn't even cope with a new vampire.
[01:39:39.315 --> 01:39:41.637]  Like his Salem's Lot is Nosferatu.
[01:39:41.637 --> 01:39:44.899]  It's the same damn plastic mask and everything!
[01:39:44.899 --> 01:39:49.562]  And then whole lines lifted out of Bram Stoker's.
[01:39:49.562 --> 01:39:51.263]  And it's not like an ode to something.
[01:39:51.263 --> 01:39:55.105]  You know, when I quote Mark Twain, I tell you Mark Twain said it.
[01:39:55.105 --> 01:40:00.629]  I wouldn't be surprised if he just quotes Mark Twain and says it's his.
[01:40:00.629 --> 01:40:07.813]  Yeah, look at the vampire from Salem's Lot and look at the German Nosferatu.
[01:40:07.813 --> 01:40:08.574]  It's identical.
[01:40:10.715 --> 01:40:12.540]  And again, a lot of that stuff goes on.
[01:40:12.540 --> 01:40:16.669]  It's like it's so much of it.
[01:40:16.669 --> 01:40:19.034]  And you read a Stephen King book and you're like, I've read this before.
[01:40:22.332 --> 01:40:26.134]  And it just gets old, but I don't want to go off on a jag about him.
[01:40:26.134 --> 01:40:30.936]  I want to go to your phone calls on the other side of this break, and we'll do it right through the next hour.
[01:40:30.936 --> 01:40:36.999]  And then Owen Schreier is at the debates tonight, the last Democrat debate.
[01:40:36.999 --> 01:40:38.600]  Robert Barnes sent me a text the other day.
[01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:40.961]  He said, look, Trump literally quoted you.
[01:40:40.961 --> 01:40:45.163]  No, he just saw the same thing.
[01:40:45.163 --> 01:40:48.665]  And that was, Trump said, watching these Democrat debates is like dying.
[01:40:50.543 --> 01:40:52.924]  That's exactly what I said during the debates the last few times.
[01:40:52.924 --> 01:40:53.745]  This is like death.
[01:40:53.745 --> 01:40:56.626]  It's like, I feel like I'm dying watching it, but I'll watch it.
[01:40:56.626 --> 01:40:58.307]  I have to report on it.
[01:40:58.307 --> 01:41:02.129]  And it looks like a bunch of zombies that are malfunctioning.
[01:41:02.129 --> 01:41:08.373]  Even the younger ones, other than Tulsi, look like they're like animatrons or something.
[01:41:08.373 --> 01:41:14.356]  They don't look human because they've given themselves over to the system, just selling out to anything they can.
[01:41:14.356 --> 01:41:15.237]  What do I need to do?
[01:41:15.237 --> 01:41:17.358]  What do I need to act like to get somewhere?
[01:41:17.358 --> 01:41:19.319]  And there's no authenticity in them.
[01:41:20.845 --> 01:41:22.206]  The robots are taking over.
[01:41:22.206 --> 01:41:22.707]  We've met them.
[01:41:22.707 --> 01:41:24.729]  It's called us.
[01:41:24.729 --> 01:41:26.350]  Most people's children don't even talk to them now.
[01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:29.453]  They just grunt at them because all they do is on screens all day.
[01:41:29.453 --> 01:41:30.354]  Language is being reduced.
[01:41:30.354 --> 01:41:31.595]  So many bad things are happening.
[01:41:31.595 --> 01:41:34.017]  And I don't list all these bad things to be fatalistic.
[01:41:34.017 --> 01:41:38.682]  I list it because I believe in you, and I believe when you hear about the facts, you'll want to take action.
[01:41:38.682 --> 01:41:40.003]  You know, I barely plugged today.
[01:41:40.003 --> 01:41:41.725]  I really, really need to plug.
[01:41:44.076 --> 01:41:47.320]  Something very exciting has happened, and it is exciting.
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:48.301]  Ultimate fish oil.
[01:41:48.301 --> 01:41:58.812]  We've got the biggest, best, cleanest fish oil you're going to find, and we explain it on the store that this is expensive because it goes through the process of having any mercury removed.
[01:41:58.812 --> 01:42:03.337]  So you can get fish all day that's great and tastes really good, but you're going to get a lot of mercury in it that builds up.
[01:42:04.318 --> 01:42:09.845]  A lot of estimates are the Japanese are the longest-lived people in the world as any major group, but then their brains also get eaten by mercury.
[01:42:09.845 --> 01:42:16.133]  If there wasn't mercury in the fish, I think they'd probably live to 130 routinely, not 115 routinely.
[01:42:16.133 --> 01:42:20.939]  So again, we have the very, very best, and I want to show TV viewers, so I'm about to take one of these.
[01:42:20.939 --> 01:42:22.942]  Look at the size of that baby.
[01:42:24.908 --> 01:42:31.772]  I mean, that is pure, clean fish oil that goes through the process of removing the mercury without boiling it.
[01:42:31.772 --> 01:42:33.973]  Because when they boil it, it just fries it.
[01:42:33.973 --> 01:42:42.919]  So if you want your absolute, complete fish oil with all of the omega acids and so much more, it's back in stock, 33% off.
[01:42:42.919 --> 01:42:46.101]  That's as low as we can go because there's not a lot of market for these.
[01:42:46.101 --> 01:42:49.863]  And if you want this for yourself and your family, it's at InfoWareStore.com.
[01:42:49.863 --> 01:42:51.344]  Ultimate fish oil back in stock.
[01:42:51.344 --> 01:42:52.424]  Ultimate fish oil back in stock.
[01:42:52.424 --> 01:42:53.025]  InfoWareStore.com.
[01:42:55.345 --> 01:43:01.169]  I want to talk about Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[01:43:01.169 --> 01:43:04.712]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[01:43:04.712 --> 01:43:07.034]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[01:43:07.034 --> 01:43:08.855]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[01:43:08.855 --> 01:43:16.441]  So here I am telling people Super Silver Whitening Toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[01:43:16.441 --> 01:43:16.861]  And I'm 45 years old.
[01:43:17.662 --> 01:43:19.663]  And I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[01:43:19.663 --> 01:43:21.343]  And it's fluoride-free.
[01:43:21.343 --> 01:43:24.585]  I think the big difference, the game-changer in this is the Coral Calcium.
[01:43:24.585 --> 01:43:28.206]  Because after I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean.
[01:43:28.206 --> 01:43:32.868]  And the toothpaste, I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[01:43:32.868 --> 01:43:35.109]  It feels so good.
[01:43:35.109 --> 01:43:38.310]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[01:43:38.310 --> 01:43:44.512]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now.
[01:43:44.512 --> 01:43:46.173]  Because I like the way it feels.
[01:43:55.694 --> 01:44:00.277]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up.
[01:44:00.277 --> 01:44:02.239]  I've said it many times, I will never give in.
[01:44:02.239 --> 01:44:06.882]  I will never give up, but I could give out.
[01:44:06.882 --> 01:44:20.832]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity, to see evil running rampant like this, and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace.
[01:44:20.832 --> 01:44:24.034]  That most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:37.008]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about NewsWars.com, InfoWars.com, and Ban.Video.
[01:44:37.008 --> 01:44:39.770]  And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever.
[01:44:39.770 --> 01:44:47.735]  And that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have is at InfoWars.com forward slash show and Ban.Video.
[01:44:47.735 --> 01:44:49.176]  So take heart folks.
[01:44:49.176 --> 01:44:54.820]  They've had to censor everybody and shut everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[01:44:56.402 --> 01:45:11.182]  I keep my eye on the news all the time, but I miss the fact that in late 2019, just about two weeks ago, the CDC and the FDA approved live Ebola vaccine.
[01:45:12.130 --> 01:45:16.614]  To be given inside the United States, and it is an experimental vaccine.
[01:45:16.614 --> 01:45:18.476]  It is live.
[01:45:18.476 --> 01:45:20.498]  It's not even attenuated.
[01:45:20.498 --> 01:45:24.902]  They've just genetically modified it, so it's supposedly not lethal.
[01:45:24.902 --> 01:45:30.588]  Same stuff they did with the Gardasil vaccine that's admittedly killed and made so many.
[01:45:30.588 --> 01:45:32.790]  This is just crazy.
[01:45:32.790 --> 01:45:36.113]  And the Congo's had the biggest outbreaks of Ebola ever since they started.
[01:45:36.974 --> 01:45:39.377]  Giving the vaccine there in the last few years.
[01:45:39.377 --> 01:45:46.404]  Oh, and of course open the borders up here and letting people in unfettered the Democrats distribute across the country.
[01:45:46.404 --> 01:45:53.412]  You cannot make up the magnitude of this insanity and it is an attempted Ebola assault on America.
[01:45:53.412 --> 01:45:56.035]  This is the new world order.
[01:45:56.035 --> 01:45:58.237]  Hey, you there.
[01:45:58.237 --> 01:45:58.898]  We have a problem.
[01:45:59.940 --> 01:46:02.742]  You see, there is a baby.
[01:46:02.742 --> 01:46:06.625]  The mother of this baby is not sure she's ready.
[01:46:06.625 --> 01:46:10.748]  The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down.
[01:46:10.748 --> 01:46:13.530]  The mother starts to have regrets.
[01:46:13.530 --> 01:46:17.312]  The father considers leaving town.
[01:46:17.312 --> 01:46:20.635]  But a friend says there's a solution.
[01:46:20.635 --> 01:46:24.778]  She says to have an abortion.
[01:46:24.778 --> 01:46:26.679]  The mother decides to look into it.
[01:46:26.679 --> 01:46:28.721]  The clinic assures her it's safe.
[01:46:29.744 --> 01:46:31.525]  She's made her decision.
[01:46:31.525 --> 01:46:34.027]  She's going to have an abortion.
[01:46:34.027 --> 01:46:40.310]  The problem is, that baby is you.
[01:46:40.310 --> 01:46:49.336]  Join me, Owen Schroyer, at the March for Life, Friday, January 24th, in Washington, D.C., noon, at the National Mall.
[01:46:49.336 --> 01:46:50.476]  I'll see you there.
[01:46:50.476 --> 01:46:52.938]  It's time to stand up for the unborn.
[01:46:52.938 --> 01:46:54.919]  It's time to speak out for the voiceless.
[01:46:59.989 --> 01:47:02.597]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:14.640 --> 01:47:17.041]  Bombshell videos posted at Infowars.com.
[01:47:17.041 --> 01:47:22.702]  Bernie Sanders' organizer warns conservatives will go to Soviet-style gulags for re-education.
[01:47:22.702 --> 01:47:26.843]  Police will be violently attacked, and cities will burn if Trump wins.
[01:47:26.843 --> 01:47:28.384]  Meanwhile, CNN.
[01:47:28.384 --> 01:47:32.585]  Nancy Pelosi believes Mitch McConnell may be compromised by the Russians.
[01:47:32.585 --> 01:47:33.165]  Everyone's...
[01:47:34.726 --> 01:47:50.839]  An anti-American compromised by foreign powers, except the Democrats, who are literally on the Qaikom titty, telling us no borders, no wall, no USA at all, that Trump's saying America should exist, is white supremacists.
[01:47:50.839 --> 01:47:55.803]  Unbelievable.
[01:47:55.803 --> 01:47:58.025]  The Democrats are not on a mercy mission.
[01:48:03.962 --> 01:48:05.563]  And we are back live.
[01:48:05.563 --> 01:48:13.686]  You know, I said at this segment that I was going to get to this article, but I want to go ahead and just go to your phone calls.
[01:48:34.813 --> 01:48:38.395]  And then later in the next hour, I'm gonna get to this, but this is really a big deal.
[01:48:38.395 --> 01:48:42.797]  We named the live show article at Infowars.com today.
[01:48:42.797 --> 01:48:45.779]  We'll pull it up here for folks.
[01:48:45.779 --> 01:48:47.740]  What this really is.
[01:48:47.740 --> 01:48:58.106]  And it just shows how the mad scientists have really gone off the edge of a cliff.
[01:48:58.106 --> 01:49:02.308]  And that we know how to ban nuclear weapons.
[01:49:04.622 --> 01:49:05.042]  I don't
[01:49:22.705 --> 01:49:27.609]  Island continent in the Atlantic Ocean, hence Atlantis.
[01:49:27.609 --> 01:49:33.394]  And that there was a big white column of light that powered ships that flew.
[01:49:33.394 --> 01:49:39.079]  They had craft that flew like ships of the sea, but in the air.
[01:49:39.079 --> 01:49:44.804]  And that their power source blew up and blew the entire continent up.
[01:49:44.804 --> 01:49:48.928]  And that the Earth was dark for many years and all the rest of it, which would happen during a big meteor.
[01:49:48.928 --> 01:49:49.449]  Who knows?
[01:49:50.512 --> 01:49:51.872]  Who knows what really happened.
[01:49:51.872 --> 01:50:03.196]  The point is we're now really approaching that real moment with genetic engineering and all the things that are being done in the geoengineering that's admittedly going on but remains classified the details.
[01:50:03.196 --> 01:50:09.378]  So I'm going to talk more about that but I want to get to your phone calls.
[01:50:09.378 --> 01:50:16.541]  But before I do that I want to do one more thing.
[01:50:16.541 --> 01:50:17.721]  And that's play a little clip.
[01:50:19.955 --> 01:50:26.794]  Fans cheer Donald Trump as he attends college football championship game.
[01:50:48.484 --> 01:50:58.455]  Now that's really just a simple thing at the NCAA College Championship football game.
[01:50:58.455 --> 01:51:00.217]  I mean it really shouldn't be.
[01:51:01.852 --> 01:51:03.312]  That big of a deal?
[01:51:03.312 --> 01:51:25.178]  But you see, when the whole Hollywood combine and all the newspapers and all the systems are demonizing the President, saying he's bad, and telling you that you can't cheer for him, what does it do when leftists who are under the mind control and really believe that everybody hates Trump is really a Nazi, what does it do when he marches out there on the field and the majority of people are chanting, four more years?
[01:51:30.063 --> 01:51:31.244]  What does that do?
[01:51:31.244 --> 01:51:37.669]  Well, it shatters the narrative that Hollywood's got all this power and that what they're saying is true.
[01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:40.371]  We now know it's a lie.
[01:51:40.371 --> 01:51:49.979]  And the fact that they have this power and can make people believe that up is down and down is up is really a fraud.
[01:51:49.979 --> 01:51:56.444]  And so the more they throw at us trying to make us submit to them, the more people wake up and start resisting them.
[01:51:58.069 --> 01:52:00.170]  So you have to ask, what are they going to do next to counter that?
[01:52:00.170 --> 01:52:23.958]  Well, that's why this whole big Bernie Sanders information that's come out is so huge that not only all those other Democratic Party officials we played in the first hour saying they want to put Americans in re-education camps, they want to take our guns, they want to trigger a civil war, they want to cause a race war, they want to burn down the cities, but that they're really planning it.
[01:52:24.952 --> 01:52:42.721]  And think that's how they're going to stop the restoration of America and all they've been promised at the colleges, their power, their control, how they're all going to have positions in the new Commissariat, in the domestic GRU.
[01:52:42.721 --> 01:52:49.885]  And they see Communist China being propped up by the CFR and they see what they were able to do in Russia and Bernie Sanders was actually trained in Russia.
[01:52:50.936 --> 01:53:03.263]  He's the Democratic Party candidate, but Nancy Pelosi, the clip's up on InfoWars.com, there's video of it, CNN's saying Nancy Pelosi believes Mitch McConnell may be compromised by Russians.
[01:53:03.263 --> 01:53:07.645]  Yeah, he might have Easter bunnies living in his rear end as well.
[01:53:07.645 --> 01:53:10.207]  Hell, maybe Lucky Charms.
[01:53:10.207 --> 01:53:15.170]  Elf or, I guess that's not an elf, Lucky Charms would be a leprechaun.
[01:53:15.170 --> 01:53:17.791]  Maybe a leprechaun lives inside his nose.
[01:53:17.791 --> 01:53:18.992]  I mean, you can't prove it.
[01:53:20.742 --> 01:53:23.903]  These people are a joke, you know.
[01:53:23.903 --> 01:53:31.385]  She's telegraphing, right there, what they're planning next week.
[01:53:31.385 --> 01:53:35.026]  Because they're going to transmit the articles, supposedly, tomorrow.
[01:53:35.026 --> 01:53:42.968]  And they've got to organize some of it, but it looks like the trial's probably going to start on Monday, if I had to guess.
[01:53:42.968 --> 01:53:47.749]  They still haven't really said, but I'm not a betting man, except on the third dimension.
[01:53:47.749 --> 01:53:50.010]  I don't bet in facsimiles.
[01:53:51.653 --> 01:53:53.514]  I don't bet in the casinos.
[01:53:53.514 --> 01:53:55.816]  It's like I don't have sex with blow-up dolls.
[01:53:55.816 --> 01:53:58.878]  I was on Mankow's radio show this morning.
[01:53:58.878 --> 01:54:02.480]  He said, well, Japan's spending billions trying to develop the best sex robots.
[01:54:02.480 --> 01:54:03.121]  Would you ever do that?
[01:54:03.121 --> 01:54:04.182]  I said, no.
[01:54:04.182 --> 01:54:07.944]  It's kind of like if I'm at the department store and they've got plastic fruit.
[01:54:07.944 --> 01:54:11.627]  I just, I don't eat the plastic apples and things.
[01:54:11.627 --> 01:54:13.188]  It'd be like plastic cherry pie.
[01:54:13.188 --> 01:54:16.210]  You know, I want the real thing.
[01:54:16.210 --> 01:54:18.612]  But see, that's what gambling is.
[01:54:19.724 --> 01:54:24.067]  Gambling is like a plastic blow-up doll instead of the real thing.
[01:54:24.067 --> 01:54:28.651]  Because you're designed to gamble on things that matter, like your future, your children, your destiny.
[01:54:28.651 --> 01:54:30.232]  I mean, I am a gambler.
[01:54:30.232 --> 01:54:34.835]  I believe in the people, I believe in humanity, I believe in you.
[01:54:34.835 --> 01:54:39.098]  But I don't gamble at a slot machine where the odds are rigged.
[01:54:39.098 --> 01:54:47.004]  And I'm exposing the globalists who are trying to rig the odds against the average person, and that's not a good future for any of us, and we can defeat that together.
[01:54:50.728 --> 01:54:54.751]  The system is trying to not just domesticate us, they're trying to make us obsolete.
[01:54:54.751 --> 01:54:58.995]  And I know you know that, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:54:58.995 --> 01:55:03.718]  All right, so we're going to go to your calls, fresh as we begin the next hour, because I don't want to cut you short.
[01:55:03.718 --> 01:55:11.685]  Roberto, Eli, Steve, Lucas, Mary Lou, Joseph, Mike, Levi, and Michael, and many, many others.
[01:55:11.685 --> 01:55:16.608]  And we'll take your calls into the fourth hour that I'm also hosting.
[01:55:17.552 --> 01:55:26.297]  I will get to all the breaking news as it quickly comes in as we track what's unfolding at Newshorse.com, Infowars.com, and Band.video.
[01:55:26.297 --> 01:55:41.467]  Now, I did not really do a good plug first hour or second hour for what's happening here at Infowars, so I'm going to do it right now, and then we're going to come back and take your calls one after another.
[01:55:41.467 --> 01:55:46.610]  But, I am
[01:55:48.459 --> 01:55:54.724]  So glad on so many fronts that Ultimate Fish Oil is back in.
[01:55:54.724 --> 01:55:56.005]  We sell out of it.
[01:55:56.005 --> 01:55:57.947]  We sell out of the Krill Oil.
[01:55:57.947 --> 01:55:58.848]  People love it.
[01:55:58.848 --> 01:56:04.432]  They know that it's very high-end, that they get great results from it.
[01:56:04.432 --> 01:56:07.195]  Now, Krill Oil does one thing.
[01:56:07.195 --> 01:56:08.996]  High-quality fish oil does another.
[01:56:08.996 --> 01:56:13.520]  It's similar, but two different delivery systems.
[01:56:13.520 --> 01:56:14.461]  But this has all
[01:56:16.201 --> 01:56:16.381]  I think?
[01:56:37.898 --> 01:56:38.058]  Yes.
[01:56:52.677 --> 01:56:55.038]  Gelatin capsule that you've ever put in.
[01:56:55.038 --> 01:56:55.758]  We want to put in more.
[01:56:55.758 --> 01:57:00.000]  And they said, well, they've just come out with these even bigger capsules.
[01:57:00.000 --> 01:57:04.162]  We haven't test marketed these yet, but these are big, giant horse pills.
[01:57:04.162 --> 01:57:07.923]  And per bottle, you'll have the most cleanest and very best without mercury.
[01:57:07.923 --> 01:57:09.704]  That's what makes it more expensive for us.
[01:57:09.704 --> 01:57:11.665]  We don't jack up the price on you.
[01:57:11.665 --> 01:57:13.745]  So here it is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:13.745 --> 01:57:15.186]  Ultimate fish oil.
[01:57:15.186 --> 01:57:17.067]  Targeted release fish oil.
[01:57:17.067 --> 01:57:19.148]  And Dr. McCamp shot, please.
[01:57:19.148 --> 01:57:19.548]  It is
[01:57:20.956 --> 01:57:25.397]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers of InfoWars.
[01:57:49.574 --> 01:57:59.963]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana as a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S., but worldwide.
[01:57:59.963 --> 01:58:06.789]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[01:58:07.489 --> 01:58:17.243]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that and some other areas, but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[01:58:17.243 --> 01:58:19.946]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever.
[01:58:20.794 --> 01:58:25.955]  We really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[01:58:25.955 --> 01:58:30.917]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[01:58:30.917 --> 01:58:33.277]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[01:58:33.277 --> 01:58:39.059]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[01:58:39.059 --> 01:58:41.059]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[01:58:41.059 --> 01:58:44.160]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[01:58:46.693 --> 01:58:48.934]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:48.934 --> 01:58:51.136]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:51.136 --> 01:58:53.157]  Infowarslife.com.
[01:58:53.157 --> 01:59:02.423]  You go to that URL, it takes you to the subsection of Infowarsstore.com where you find the 60 plus products where we've gone out and researched what is the best,
[01:59:03.063 --> 01:59:04.824]  What gives people the best results?
[01:59:04.824 --> 01:59:08.545]  We either private label it or we develop our own with top developers.
[01:59:08.545 --> 01:59:13.407]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[01:59:13.407 --> 01:59:16.309]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[01:59:16.309 --> 01:59:17.229]  It's incredible.
[01:59:17.229 --> 01:59:18.870]  So do yourself a favor.
[01:59:18.870 --> 01:59:21.371]  Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[01:59:21.371 --> 01:59:24.272]  You can't lose, except if you don't take action.
[01:59:24.272 --> 01:59:28.914]  Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering.
[01:59:28.914 --> 01:59:31.215]  Thanks to your support and God's grace and our action.
[01:59:31.795 --> 01:59:33.076]  But you need these products.
[01:59:33.076 --> 01:59:36.140]  That's the real reason you want to get them, is because they're amazing.
[01:59:36.140 --> 01:59:40.084]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[01:59:40.084 --> 01:59:43.908]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO, instead of imploding.
[01:59:43.908 --> 01:59:45.810]  We're fighting to win, and we are winning.
[01:59:45.810 --> 01:59:49.514]  Thanks to you.
[01:59:49.514 --> 01:59:52.157]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:09.206 --> 02:00:11.388]  We are back live now into hour number three.
[02:00:11.388 --> 02:00:16.352]  I'm going to be hosting the fourth hour here today.
[02:00:16.352 --> 02:00:21.916]  There are so many incredible reports at Bandot Video, but I want to take your calls and cover breaking news.
[02:00:21.916 --> 02:00:30.483]  But man, Savannah Hernandez went out yesterday and would go up to Austinites and about half of them would say, man, I got hurt by vaccines, or my mom did, or my brother did.
[02:00:30.483 --> 02:00:33.966]  But about half of them would say, I hate these anti-vaxxers.
[02:00:33.966 --> 02:00:35.107]  They're the worst people on earth.
[02:00:35.107 --> 02:00:36.008]  They ought to be arrested.
[02:00:36.598 --> 02:00:40.800]  Well, here's the head of the UN World Health Organization saying vaccines are killing people.
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:42.021]  There's a cover-up.
[02:00:42.021 --> 02:00:45.582]  And it's like you hear a record skip.
[02:00:45.582 --> 02:00:47.764]  That's the type of stuff at Bandot Video.
[02:00:47.764 --> 02:00:49.584]  There's a Savannah Hernandez section.
[02:00:49.584 --> 02:00:53.286]  There's an Action 7 section where you'll find her work.
[02:00:53.286 --> 02:00:55.227]  And we're just really proud of her.
[02:00:55.227 --> 02:00:57.969]  And she's just doing a great job.
[02:00:57.969 --> 02:00:58.269]  Okay!
[02:00:59.602 --> 02:01:06.425]  Roberto, speaking of vaccines, in New York was at the vaccine rally in New Jersey a few days ago.
[02:01:06.425 --> 02:01:11.687]  The New Jersey vaccine skeptics win as state votes to protect religious exemptions.
[02:01:11.687 --> 02:01:13.968]  That's a nationalfile.com article.
[02:01:13.968 --> 02:01:27.253]  I hope folks spread because they're trying to act like it's illegal, it's weird, it's crazy to say, you know, Big Pharma with your big dangerous history and all the admitted people that have died from vaccines and the fact that you're giving liability protection to have secret courts?
[02:01:28.251 --> 02:01:30.773]  Well, I don't trust you.
[02:01:30.773 --> 02:01:33.315]  And then they lie and say, safe and effective, never hurt anybody.
[02:01:33.315 --> 02:01:34.276]  Well, now you're lying to me.
[02:01:34.276 --> 02:01:35.277]  Now I really don't trust you.
[02:01:35.277 --> 02:01:40.321]  And then they say, well, you're going to hurt me if you're not vaccinated.
[02:01:40.321 --> 02:01:42.963]  Well, wait, you're protected.
[02:01:42.963 --> 02:01:45.365]  So why do I have to take it?
[02:01:46.209 --> 02:01:52.476]  You know, you don't care about everybody dying of fentanyl by the millions, but you do care about me not taking that jab.
[02:01:52.476 --> 02:01:53.877]  Oh, one person got smallpox!
[02:01:53.877 --> 02:01:56.360]  Oh, one person died coming across the border!
[02:01:56.360 --> 02:01:58.102]  You know, who already had a bunch of diseases.
[02:01:58.102 --> 02:01:58.983]  Oh, take the shots!
[02:02:00.697 --> 02:02:01.837]  Mr. Jones, thank you for having me on.
[02:02:01.837 --> 02:02:03.758]  I'd like to quickly plug a few of your products, if I could.
[02:02:03.758 --> 02:02:03.858]  Sure.
[02:02:29.845 --> 02:02:36.969]  Uh, so silver blue, silver, I'm sorry, super blue, silver bullet bodies is amazing for my inflammation.
[02:02:36.969 --> 02:02:44.313]  I suffered a broken vertebrae and almost lost my leg in a motorcycle accident and that has replaced all forms of Advil and everything for me.
[02:02:44.313 --> 02:02:46.274]  It's absolutely amazing.
[02:02:46.274 --> 02:02:50.656]  Um, and then I, I was present at the rally in, in New Jersey yesterday.
[02:02:50.656 --> 02:02:57.380]  I've been there as much as I could be, uh, to fight, you know, against this and, uh, it's an incredible victory.
[02:02:58.001 --> 02:03:01.625]  For us, there was an enormous amount of support from the people.
[02:03:01.625 --> 02:03:03.708]  They were very, very enthusiastic.
[02:03:03.708 --> 02:03:04.428]  So much energy.
[02:03:04.428 --> 02:03:07.552]  It was incredible.
[02:03:07.552 --> 02:03:09.074]  Well, I want to thank you for your service.
[02:03:09.074 --> 02:03:15.862]  And I don't mean that at the same level as veterans, but it's also civic service to get involved and to go demonstrate and stand up for our rights.
[02:03:15.862 --> 02:03:18.505]  So thank you for standing up for all of our rights, sir.
[02:03:19.176 --> 02:03:19.796]  Absolutely.
[02:03:19.796 --> 02:03:21.216]  I was actually present.
[02:03:21.216 --> 02:03:22.057]  I'm from New York.
[02:03:22.057 --> 02:03:28.698]  I was in the room for the vote in New York as well and watched the corruption firsthand as the bill failed.
[02:03:28.698 --> 02:03:37.619]  And there was some whispering going on throughout the room and suddenly someone stands up and says, to please our Democratic majority, I'm going to need a Democrat to change their vote.
[02:03:37.619 --> 02:03:42.940]  And right in front of our eyes, live streaming everything, they flipped the vote right in front of us.
[02:03:42.940 --> 02:03:46.381]  So from there, I moved to New Jersey six months ago to try to avoid this.
[02:03:47.581 --> 02:03:50.263]  And here we were again, facing the same situation.
[02:03:50.263 --> 02:03:54.286]  So, we just fought like madmen.
[02:03:54.286 --> 02:03:54.946]  And women.
[02:03:54.946 --> 02:03:55.767]  Mainly women.
[02:03:55.767 --> 02:04:00.170]  And I have to give the mothers incredible credit for their courage to be out there like that.
[02:04:00.170 --> 02:04:02.571]  Well, they see it's hurting the children.
[02:04:02.571 --> 02:04:03.532]  Absolutely.
[02:04:03.532 --> 02:04:04.173]  Absolutely.
[02:04:04.173 --> 02:04:04.573]  For sure.
[02:04:05.486 --> 02:04:16.916]  Well, you know, I would love when people like you go out and do that to shoot video then post it to YouTube while you still can or other places and then we'll play clips of it because it's not just your activism but showing it to the world.
[02:04:16.916 --> 02:04:19.058]  That's what's the next step.
[02:04:19.058 --> 02:04:20.279]  Absolutely.
[02:04:20.279 --> 02:04:20.799]  Absolutely.
[02:04:20.799 --> 02:04:28.486]  And I've been trying to it's tough to get through but I'm by the graces of God I'm through right now and I just would like to say to the listeners out there that
[02:04:29.338 --> 02:04:50.903]  You may be one person, but you have to be active in these events, and it would be amazing if we could find a way to utilize your platform to find where these events are locally, because... Sir, we had a plan to do it, and that's what the Deep State's hitting us and attacking us, trying to shut us down, but thanks to you, we still are going to be able to carry it out.
[02:04:55.313 --> 02:05:04.020]  I spend a lot of time reminding the M4 family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air.
[02:05:04.020 --> 02:05:05.181]  And I spend a lot of time thanking you.
[02:05:05.984 --> 02:05:13.348]  But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern Paul Revere's.
[02:05:13.348 --> 02:05:20.853]  But something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[02:05:20.853 --> 02:05:29.678]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration, the supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there.
[02:05:29.678 --> 02:05:34.221]  And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalists.
[02:05:35.137 --> 02:05:35.737]  This hard.
[02:05:35.737 --> 02:05:39.638]  So it's not a burden to support InfoWars.
[02:05:39.638 --> 02:05:50.262]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[02:05:50.262 --> 02:05:52.943]  So visit InfoWarsStore.com today.
[02:05:55.885 --> 02:05:57.245]  We've got it.
[02:05:57.245 --> 02:06:03.027]  This transmission is coming to you.
[02:06:03.027 --> 02:06:07.368]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:06:07.368 --> 02:06:15.670]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:06:15.670 --> 02:06:22.052]  We're about to go to Mary Lou in Ohio.
[02:06:22.052 --> 02:06:24.673]  You gotta love classic American on the names like Mary Lou.
[02:06:28.678 --> 02:06:35.343]  And she wants to talk about the camps.
[02:06:35.343 --> 02:06:53.855]  That's right, we've got Wesley Clark, we've got Hillary Clinton, we've got Barack Obama, we've got all these Democrat sheriffs and prosecutors and red diaper doper babies, the children of Weathermen, and the president who was raised by Weathermen.
[02:06:56.357 --> 02:07:03.019]  With official army manuals about confiscating guns and re-education camps for the American people.
[02:07:03.019 --> 02:07:05.780]  And Larry Grathwald exposing the Weathermen and their plan for it.
[02:07:05.780 --> 02:07:10.181]  And I played all that in the first hour.
[02:07:10.181 --> 02:07:24.905]  But now Project Veritas first released a 12 second clip, then a 2 minute clip, now the full 9 minute report with campaign operatives for Bernie Sanders licking their lips
[02:07:26.735 --> 02:07:35.058]  Talking about re-education camps, putting white men in camps because they're white, because that means they're Nazis.
[02:07:35.058 --> 02:07:39.800]  But they're the ones saying put people in camps because of their race, which is what the Nazis did.
[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:45.523]  And they're actually funded by George Soros, who's the greatest living Nazi collaborator we know of.
[02:07:45.523 --> 02:07:50.284]  It's unbelievable.
[02:07:50.284 --> 02:07:56.347]  And they want to trigger at the DNC national riots to bring us into martial law, overthrow Trump,
[02:07:57.381 --> 02:08:02.144]  And then use that civil war to arrest the Liberty Movement.
[02:08:02.144 --> 02:08:03.765]  And if they could start with me, they would.
[02:08:03.765 --> 02:08:07.408]  That's why I'm being demonized, being deplatformed, so they can make that arrest.
[02:08:07.408 --> 02:08:08.448]  Democrats walk up to me everywhere.
[02:08:08.448 --> 02:08:12.011]  If you've seen my video, they go, I can't wait till you're in jail.
[02:08:12.011 --> 02:08:14.892]  You're going to prison.
[02:08:14.892 --> 02:08:21.437]  Russian agent.
[02:08:21.437 --> 02:08:26.120]  Now Pelosi says Mitch McConnell may be a Russian agent, when she's a globalist agent against the country.
[02:08:28.317 --> 02:08:31.479]  It's outrageous.
[02:08:31.479 --> 02:08:36.022]  Now, let's go ahead and go to Mary Lou.
[02:08:36.022 --> 02:08:37.823]  Mary Lou, thanks for calling in today.
[02:08:37.823 --> 02:08:38.284]  Hello, Alex.
[02:08:38.284 --> 02:08:41.326]  It's such an honor to talk to you.
[02:08:41.326 --> 02:08:43.787]  I was red pilled about two years ago.
[02:08:43.787 --> 02:08:48.791]  My son, Jason, turned me on to InfoWars, and he's a 20-year listener.
[02:08:48.791 --> 02:08:50.212]  He's 39 now.
[02:08:50.212 --> 02:08:53.214]  And ever since then, I've been just hooked.
[02:08:53.214 --> 02:08:56.376]  And I've been, you know, researching and printing out
[02:08:56.815 --> 02:09:02.156]  Anything that I could, anything that...things that David Knight would talk about, documents.
[02:09:02.156 --> 02:09:15.999]  And the one document, when you showed it on the show, I believe it was yesterday, that SM-33940, the internment and resettlement operations, I was able to print that out.
[02:09:15.999 --> 02:09:22.480]  And I have the whole document, and it talks about, you know, the re-education camps, and I just couldn't believe it.
[02:09:24.335 --> 02:09:25.015]  We're good to go.
[02:09:44.764 --> 02:09:49.486]  Listen to me, I'm on the show today that they won't start listening to you.
[02:09:49.486 --> 02:09:54.888]  Most red blooded Americans, when they hear about a re-education camp, they go, well the military wouldn't do that.
[02:09:54.888 --> 02:09:58.629]  No, that's the deep state trying to turn the military against us.
[02:09:58.629 --> 02:10:01.411]  And it's crap like that that totally woke the military up.
[02:10:01.411 --> 02:10:04.392]  The military used to think I was exaggerating or crazy.
[02:10:04.392 --> 02:10:07.313]  As soon as that stuff happened, almost the entire military
[02:10:07.853 --> 02:10:09.094]  Sort of tuning in.
[02:10:09.094 --> 02:10:14.417]  Officers were telling everybody to tune into the show because they knew that we hadn't been making that stuff up.
[02:10:14.417 --> 02:10:18.480]  But we had already been getting it from people like Larry Grathwald and others.
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:20.741]  So we just had a platform.
[02:10:20.741 --> 02:10:22.722]  Most of this stuff we didn't break.
[02:10:22.722 --> 02:10:25.284]  We just effectively got it out.
[02:10:25.284 --> 02:10:28.866]  And so now their only hope is to try to trigger a race war.
[02:10:28.866 --> 02:10:33.149]  In fact, you hear the operatives say, we're going to attack the police.
[02:10:34.161 --> 02:10:43.905]  And then when they respond, we're going to say they're criminals and we're going to attack them and take them out and trigger the overthrow of the government.
[02:10:43.905 --> 02:10:54.370]  So these people want power over us to literally take us to concentration camps and rape us and torture us and kill us because it's what dirtbags want.
[02:10:54.370 --> 02:10:59.172]  They want power with none of the responsibility.
[02:10:59.172 --> 02:10:59.652]  Yes, exactly.
[02:10:59.652 --> 02:11:01.593]  And I just wanted to say, you know,
[02:11:02.881 --> 02:11:06.944]  So many people, you know, I keep telling them about, you know, Alex Jones, you've got to listen to it.
[02:11:06.944 --> 02:11:10.966]  And then they say, well, you know, how can you tell that, you know, he's the real deal?
[02:11:10.966 --> 02:11:12.587]  You know, how can you believe him over me?
[02:11:12.587 --> 02:11:16.410]  Which is totally ridiculous when you listen to it.
[02:11:16.410 --> 02:11:18.571]  And, you know, you have to listen.
[02:11:18.571 --> 02:11:19.692]  Just listen.
[02:11:19.692 --> 02:11:23.575]  And they say, well, even if I, you know, what can I do?
[02:11:23.575 --> 02:11:24.275]  What can I do about it?
[02:11:24.275 --> 02:11:25.856]  There's nothing I can do anyway.
[02:11:25.856 --> 02:11:28.398]  And what I have to say is, buy the product.
[02:11:28.398 --> 02:11:31.180]  If all you can do is buy the product support.
[02:11:31.550 --> 02:11:33.551]  The people that are out there in the trenches.
[02:11:33.551 --> 02:11:37.454]  If you don't, if you can't do it, then support the people that are doing it.
[02:11:37.454 --> 02:11:41.937]  And that's, and I've been doing that, you know, for the past few years, you know, buying all your products.
[02:11:41.937 --> 02:11:47.220]  And, you know, I think I have 10 products that I start out with every day.
[02:11:47.220 --> 02:11:49.721]  It's part of my morning regime.
[02:11:49.721 --> 02:11:51.002]  Well, Mary Luther, high quality.
[02:11:51.002 --> 02:11:52.503]  We really appreciate you and God bless.
[02:11:52.503 --> 02:11:53.344]  Just keep spreading the word.
[02:11:53.344 --> 02:11:55.305]  That's the most important thing you can do.
[02:11:55.305 --> 02:11:56.606]  Let me just say this briefly about the products.
[02:11:58.502 --> 02:12:00.704]  Folks want to help in the fight.
[02:12:00.704 --> 02:12:04.908]  And so they know we're self-supported because they're trying to shut us down.
[02:12:04.908 --> 02:12:07.110]  And so people call in and they support the products.
[02:12:07.110 --> 02:12:10.113]  But these are really good products that really help people.
[02:12:10.113 --> 02:12:14.997]  I had the Democrats file like 34 lawsuits on us.
[02:12:14.997 --> 02:12:17.680]  Big DNC law firms.
[02:12:17.680 --> 02:12:19.722]  We've knocked out all but seven of them.
[02:12:20.612 --> 02:12:28.497]  They, we estimate, are spending probably $4 million in Connecticut against us so far.
[02:12:28.497 --> 02:12:34.341]  And I mean, this is the law firm run by Senator Blumenthal and Senator Murphy.
[02:12:34.341 --> 02:12:35.302]  I mean, that U.S.
[02:12:35.302 --> 02:12:36.363]  Senators say on
[02:12:37.884 --> 02:12:42.767]  National TV, we must take Alex Jones off the air to save America.
[02:12:42.767 --> 02:12:50.231]  Well, they mean, Alex Jones and his listeners are saving America and are exposing us as the criminals we are, so we've got to get him off the air.
[02:12:50.231 --> 02:12:51.772]  Remember, everything they say is the opposite.
[02:12:51.772 --> 02:12:52.893]  I can play you the clips.
[02:12:52.893 --> 02:12:58.196]  Murphy, Blumenthal, but just in Connecticut, you know, they're operatives.
[02:12:58.196 --> 02:13:03.219]  Murphy's out of that law firm, and then, of course, Blumenthal's son is at the law firm, ponchoing things.
[02:13:03.979 --> 02:13:04.839]  With some former U.S.
[02:13:04.839 --> 02:13:09.741]  attorneys that treat me like a Al Capone mafia operation.
[02:13:09.741 --> 02:13:12.142]  And the judges treat us like that.
[02:13:12.142 --> 02:13:14.283]  Because they know the political juices.
[02:13:14.283 --> 02:13:18.424]  Travis County is where they indicted Rick Perry.
[02:13:18.424 --> 02:13:20.445]  He had to spend over $2 million.
[02:13:20.445 --> 02:13:22.726]  What did they indict Rick Perry for?
[02:13:22.726 --> 02:13:26.547]  Well, the headlines were swindling monies, running scams.
[02:13:26.547 --> 02:13:27.748]  No, he shut down
[02:13:29.099 --> 02:13:40.582]  The state board that was run by this Democrat in Austin, who was arrested drunk and attacking police, and they wouldn't remove her from running the state board he was funding.
[02:13:40.582 --> 02:13:44.103]  So he vetoed it, which is his legislative power.
[02:13:44.103 --> 02:13:48.984]  He vetoed a bill because they wouldn't fire the district attorney.
[02:13:48.984 --> 02:13:53.666]  Famously, like a zombie attacking police and they'd put a spit mask on her and all that.
[02:13:53.666 --> 02:13:55.066]  But when you hear the news,
[02:13:56.229 --> 02:13:59.530]  Rick Perry caught stealing money!
[02:13:59.530 --> 02:14:01.930]  Stole money from the legislature!
[02:14:01.930 --> 02:14:04.991]  And the left, like, he stole that money!
[02:14:04.991 --> 02:14:07.352]  A governor vetoing a bill is not stealing money.
[02:14:07.352 --> 02:14:11.753]  That's stopping the money being spent because they're misappropriating it.
[02:14:11.753 --> 02:14:18.055]  Well, the same folks are trying to railroad me, and they shake with hate when they see me.
[02:14:18.055 --> 02:14:19.475]  That's what they say every day.
[02:14:19.475 --> 02:14:20.515]  But Jones is a criminal!
[02:14:20.515 --> 02:14:21.416]  Jones didn't do that!
[02:14:21.416 --> 02:14:22.216]  Jones didn't do this!
[02:14:26.530 --> 02:14:37.582]  Then you've got to get top lawyers, all the stuff, fight the depositions, you know, go through all the stuff, depose them, battle them, because that's how we've got to be able to stay on the air.
[02:14:37.582 --> 02:14:40.185]  And so, it takes a lot of money to do that.
[02:14:40.185 --> 02:14:44.029]  It takes a lot of money to put a crew of 10 or more people into D.C.
[02:14:44.029 --> 02:14:46.152]  and Virginia, myself included.
[02:14:46.152 --> 02:14:46.913]  It's over 10 people.
[02:14:48.521 --> 02:14:49.502]  It's tons of money.
[02:14:49.502 --> 02:14:51.683]  This is a war we're fighting.
[02:14:51.683 --> 02:14:56.285]  And so, yes, that's why you buy the products, but they're also super high quality.
[02:14:56.285 --> 02:15:00.688]  And we've got Prostagard back in stock that is documented.
[02:15:00.688 --> 02:15:07.672]  Saw Palmetto does reduce cancer in the prostate, does make it shrink, does make it healthier.
[02:15:07.672 --> 02:15:09.893]  And we set out to have the very strongest, best
[02:15:10.513 --> 02:15:10.973]  I don't know.
[02:15:28.755 --> 02:15:30.697]  Doesn't homogenize to the fish oil's high quality.
[02:15:30.697 --> 02:15:31.598]  It also has krill oil in it.
[02:15:31.598 --> 02:15:32.619]  It's what's called ultimate fish oil.
[02:15:32.619 --> 02:15:34.522]  It's a spectrum of three.
[02:15:34.522 --> 02:15:37.124]  The salmon, the anchovy, and the krill.
[02:15:37.124 --> 02:15:38.806]  The three best together.
[02:15:38.806 --> 02:15:40.428]  And they're big ol' juicy horse pills.
[02:15:40.428 --> 02:15:42.410]  They're so amazing for you and your body.
[02:15:42.410 --> 02:15:43.792]  They're back in stock.
[02:15:43.792 --> 02:15:44.493]  33% off.
[02:15:44.493 --> 02:15:46.235]  Infowarscore.com.

[02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:24.731]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[02:16:24.731 --> 02:16:28.653]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:16:28.653 --> 02:16:30.194]  I sued the IRS and won.
[02:16:30.194 --> 02:16:33.156]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[02:16:33.156 --> 02:16:38.719]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[02:16:38.719 --> 02:16:39.919]  I can help you, too.

[02:17:00.681 --> 02:17:02.283]  But the symptoms are there.
[02:17:02.283 --> 02:17:10.629]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.

[02:18:37.665 --> 02:18:39.167]  I want to go after the globalists.

[02:19:53.240 --> 02:20:00.109]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:20:17.904 --> 02:20:29.091]  Alright, look, we got so many amazing callers, and I'm gonna try to move through them as quickly as possible, but I have to hit one more piece of news here.
[02:20:29.091 --> 02:20:44.160]  Now... This, this subject... makes me so upset.
[02:20:44.160 --> 02:20:44.600]  Because...
[02:20:48.797 --> 02:20:55.163]  Our own fellow humans are working against their own self-interest out of fear.
[02:20:55.163 --> 02:21:10.036]  And going through the persecution we've gone through has showed me the techniques that these technocrats use at a level that only somebody like Trump would have experienced.
[02:21:10.036 --> 02:21:13.799]  And when you see how they operate from the center of the attack,
[02:21:17.739 --> 02:21:24.324]  It's extremely informative.
[02:21:24.324 --> 02:21:28.247]  Google gets up in front of Congress last year and says, we've never censored anybody.
[02:21:28.247 --> 02:21:29.488]  We've never gained a result.
[02:21:29.488 --> 02:21:31.469]  We've never done anything.
[02:21:31.469 --> 02:21:34.892]  Meanwhile, they say, oh, but we give you authoritative results and screen out the bad ones.
[02:21:34.892 --> 02:21:37.954]  Well, you just said you're censoring.
[02:21:37.954 --> 02:21:40.736]  It should be whatever's getting the most links goes to the top.
[02:21:40.736 --> 02:21:41.737]  That's what made it successful.
[02:21:41.737 --> 02:21:42.578]  That's why people trusted it.
[02:21:43.541 --> 02:21:45.162]  People can figure it out.
[02:21:45.162 --> 02:21:46.002]  They can vote on it.
[02:21:46.002 --> 02:21:59.549]  They can... No, but you game it completely, and so any mention of the Hillary death count gets taken down, or any mention of glyphosates hurting people, until all these scientific groups came out and confirmed it, would be removed as well.
[02:21:59.549 --> 02:22:06.233]  We have major studies about glyphosate killing people, and they would cover it up, and Google would delist it ten years ago.
[02:22:06.233 --> 02:22:08.074]  They were taking money under the table to do it.
[02:22:10.981 --> 02:22:13.542]  And they've got all these employees that are so anti-American.
[02:22:13.542 --> 02:22:24.025]  They'll say things like, we won't work with the Pentagon on AI, but we'll work with China because they're good.
[02:22:24.025 --> 02:22:24.945]  So I did a test.
[02:22:24.945 --> 02:22:27.665]  You know, we broke that big story.
[02:22:27.665 --> 02:22:34.707]  Head UN scientist at the Vaccine Safety Forum comes out and says, vaccines are killing people.
[02:22:34.707 --> 02:22:36.688]  There's a coverup and they're not safe.
[02:22:38.493 --> 02:22:39.714]  And that's not edited video.
[02:22:39.714 --> 02:22:43.235]  That's the raw thing she said and her colleagues agree.
[02:22:43.235 --> 02:22:44.556]  Put it out Friday.
[02:22:44.556 --> 02:22:47.557]  Hundreds of thousands of views at Man.Video.
[02:22:47.557 --> 02:22:48.437]  Millions.
[02:22:48.437 --> 02:22:51.258]  Undoubtedly saw it Sunday night when I aired it.
[02:22:51.258 --> 02:22:53.899]  But you saw it and that's it.
[02:22:53.899 --> 02:22:57.741]  Document Cam, shot please.
[02:22:57.741 --> 02:22:59.682]  National File.
[02:22:59.682 --> 02:23:05.744]  When you search the headline, which is a great site we work with, it comes up.
[02:23:05.744 --> 02:23:06.965]  Reporting on our report.
[02:23:11.530 --> 02:23:17.754]  Video, United Nations scientist admits vaccine death says better explanations needed.
[02:23:17.754 --> 02:23:20.896]  Totally truthful headline, those are exact quotes.
[02:23:20.896 --> 02:23:28.301]  When you go to Google, national file comes up, but nothing from InfoWars.
[02:23:28.301 --> 02:23:38.949]  Then it force feeds CDC propaganda and UN propaganda, and then Revolution Radio and some other patriots, and then
[02:23:41.607 --> 02:23:44.028]  A few other people, but that's it.
[02:23:44.028 --> 02:23:49.029]  Not one mainstream article attacking and saying we're lying.
[02:23:49.029 --> 02:23:50.389]  The silence is deafening as we're not.
[02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:52.509]  And where's Breitbart?
[02:23:52.509 --> 02:23:56.170]  Where's all these groups?
[02:23:56.170 --> 02:23:59.871]  Where is Daily Caller?
[02:23:59.871 --> 02:24:05.292]  Because that's an earth-shattering giant story.
[02:24:05.292 --> 02:24:10.673]  Top UN scientist admits vaccines killing people during vaccine safety summit.
[02:24:11.974 --> 02:24:18.298]  That's the head scientist at the UN!
[02:24:18.298 --> 02:24:24.743]  And you have to type in the exact headline and put InfoWars.com on the end of it to even have it searchable.
[02:24:24.743 --> 02:24:27.685]  It is in the Phantom Zone.
[02:24:27.685 --> 02:24:32.769]  The UN panel, in secret, meeting.
[02:24:32.769 --> 02:24:36.011]  Somebody leaks it on the UN website, but with no fanfare.
[02:24:37.904 --> 02:24:38.625]  We get it.
[02:24:38.625 --> 02:24:40.126]  Listeners point it out.
[02:24:40.126 --> 02:24:42.288]  We report on it.
[02:24:42.288 --> 02:24:45.031]  And you could hear crickets.
[02:24:45.031 --> 02:24:46.473]  That's the deplatforming.
[02:24:46.473 --> 02:24:49.055]  We're all talking to each other.
[02:24:49.055 --> 02:24:54.260]  And somebody driving through the desert, or driving through the woods right now, or driving through the city, they're hearing us for the first time.
[02:24:54.260 --> 02:24:56.162]  Then they go, oh, that's the Alex Jones guy.
[02:24:56.162 --> 02:24:59.305]  They told me he's a big liar.
[02:24:59.305 --> 02:25:01.788]  Why'd they tell you I was a liar on every channel constantly?
[02:25:03.561 --> 02:25:05.502]  Why every day are there big news articles lying about me?
[02:25:05.502 --> 02:25:07.703]  Why do they pay former employees to lie about us?
[02:25:07.703 --> 02:25:12.664]  Because, folks, we exposed the pedophile rings and specifically said how they operated.
[02:25:12.664 --> 02:25:16.386]  We specifically exposed the vaccines and how they're operating.
[02:25:16.386 --> 02:25:18.186]  And they don't like it.
[02:25:18.186 --> 02:25:21.187]  So, again, it's not about how great InfoWars is.
[02:25:21.187 --> 02:25:21.968]  That's normal.
[02:25:23.291 --> 02:25:36.664]  Just like the government scientists that said 40-something years into it, hey, we're giving black people syphilis and telling them we're giving them medical checkups and vaccines, and they're spreading it to a lot of other people and it's really horrible, and they die horrible deaths.
[02:25:36.664 --> 02:25:40.687]  Some of the people took 30-something years to die.
[02:25:40.687 --> 02:25:45.892]  Syphilis is like microscopic worms that eat your brain and organs.
[02:25:45.892 --> 02:25:46.333]  It's horrible.
[02:25:49.107 --> 02:25:53.611]  Today, if that was going on, because there's stuff far worse going on, Google's not going to let you know, folks.
[02:25:53.611 --> 02:25:59.317]  Google works with China to help round up people that criticize the government, even mildly.
[02:25:59.317 --> 02:26:04.622]  Google delists news about China and two million Muslims in concentration camps.
[02:26:04.622 --> 02:26:11.549]  I don't want to submit to Islam, but I don't want to put Muslims that were non-violent in China in concentration camps and work them to death.
[02:26:11.549 --> 02:26:12.490]  I'm the bad guy.
[02:26:12.490 --> 02:26:13.110]  See how that works?
[02:26:13.931 --> 02:26:16.693]  That's how sick and morally bankrupt this whole thing is.
[02:26:16.693 --> 02:26:22.258]  Sundar Pichai is like Hitler for real.
[02:26:22.258 --> 02:26:25.561]  Eric Schmidt is pure evil.
[02:26:25.561 --> 02:26:30.485]  But they know you've been taught that only white men are bad, so they put an Indian out front.
[02:26:30.485 --> 02:26:39.473]  Sundar, to lie to everyone, and to suppress that Islam is attacking and trying to take over India,
[02:26:41.209 --> 02:26:45.133]  And that China is murdering Muslims and enslaving them?
[02:26:45.133 --> 02:26:48.216]  He'll just do whatever he's told by any big dictatorship.
[02:26:48.216 --> 02:26:50.318]  He's a dangerous, bad person.
[02:26:50.318 --> 02:27:02.911]  He's a liar!
[02:27:02.911 --> 02:27:03.472]  Think about that.
[02:27:05.256 --> 02:27:06.919]  Google's moved to China, officially.
[02:27:06.919 --> 02:27:08.482]  Helped suppress their people, so has Apple.
[02:27:08.482 --> 02:27:17.718]  But again, Tim Cook goes to the Golden Globe Awards to sit around those other mummies with a big bowtie on, and he looks like a psychotic, aggressive dick.
[02:27:21.992 --> 02:27:22.733]  And, but you know what?
[02:27:22.733 --> 02:27:24.013]  You judge a tree by its fruits.
[02:27:24.013 --> 02:27:25.774]  The man is pure poison.
[02:27:25.774 --> 02:27:30.657]  But because he hops around, going, eh, eh, eh, eh, it's supposedly okay.
[02:27:30.657 --> 02:27:33.178]  Look at that shmug, evil face.
[02:27:33.178 --> 02:27:43.704]  The communist Chinese even came to him four years ago, it was in their news, and said, you pay the lowest of any factories in China, people are committing suicide, you put nets up around them.
[02:27:43.704 --> 02:27:45.505]  If you just paid people 5% more,
[02:27:47.446 --> 02:27:52.028]  They could have enough to put their kids in daycare and not chain them up at power poles.
[02:27:52.028 --> 02:27:55.209]  And the kids poop on the side of the road, just chained up.
[02:27:55.209 --> 02:27:59.091]  Three-year-olds, while mom works a 14-hour shift, literally.
[02:27:59.091 --> 02:28:01.652]  And Tim Cook said, go to hell!
[02:28:01.652 --> 02:28:03.893]  I get all the money!
[02:28:03.893 --> 02:28:07.115]  And I pay zero tax because I'm gay!
[02:28:07.115 --> 02:28:08.495]  I'm gay!
[02:28:08.495 --> 02:28:12.217]  I can kill whoever I want, I'm gay!
[02:28:16.584 --> 02:28:28.913]  And I can censor Americans all day long and I can give the communist Chinese the code keys to every Apple user's phone and device and let them mine your photos and everything because America's going down and I'm Tim Cook!
[02:28:28.913 --> 02:28:31.615]  I've got the power to screw everybody over!
[02:28:31.615 --> 02:28:33.297]  I'm powerful because I'm evil!
[02:28:35.899 --> 02:28:37.239]  What you are is a piece of trash.
[02:28:37.239 --> 02:28:48.543]  Who would want to sit around with all those mummies, all those skeksies, all those ugly bug-eyed vultures in the poison air of Los Angeles at some Golden Globes, you know, thing.
[02:28:48.543 --> 02:28:51.084]  Like a bunch of, you know, your birdcage liner under them.
[02:28:51.824 --> 02:28:52.505]  Filth.
[02:28:52.505 --> 02:28:53.485]  Filth.
[02:28:53.485 --> 02:28:58.048]  If you're trying to quit drinking or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[02:28:58.048 --> 02:29:00.150]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[02:29:00.150 --> 02:29:01.871]  I had a problem like you once.
[02:29:01.871 --> 02:29:08.435]  I drank and used to party a little too much till it got out of control and almost ruined my life.
[02:29:08.435 --> 02:29:13.499]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem before it totally destroyed me.
[02:29:13.499 --> 02:29:18.202]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[02:29:18.642 --> 02:29:21.743]  You need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[02:29:21.743 --> 02:29:28.765]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits and totally change your life.
[02:29:28.765 --> 02:29:33.947]  And if you have PPO private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[02:29:33.947 --> 02:29:37.248]  Fix your problem right now before it gets any worse.
[02:29:37.248 --> 02:29:38.188]  Get clean.
[02:29:38.188 --> 02:29:40.029]  Call now and learn more.
[02:29:40.029 --> 02:29:40.069]  800-506-6740.
[02:29:46.032 --> 02:29:48.094]  800-506-6740.
[02:29:48.094 --> 02:29:54.521]  That's 800-506-6740.
[02:29:54.521 --> 02:30:02.709]  Knock on wood, I am not tempting fate, but everybody around the office, especially folks that have worked here a long time,
[02:30:03.945 --> 02:30:06.726]  I've noticed that I really don't ever get sick.
[02:30:06.726 --> 02:30:10.347]  Now, again, I might get sick tomorrow because I just made that statement.
[02:30:10.347 --> 02:30:11.627]  I'm not tempting fate.
[02:30:11.627 --> 02:30:14.728]  I'll say that again because I am superstitious when it comes down to that.
[02:30:14.728 --> 02:30:19.370]  I'm very thankful to the good Lord for the constitution I've been given.
[02:30:19.370 --> 02:30:28.253]  But up until about eight, nine years ago when I started taking X2 and the products to enforce life, I still got sick every couple of years.
[02:30:29.375 --> 02:30:44.830]  And I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that, but now that I religiously take the products at InfoWars Life, one of the highest quality supplements you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore.
[02:30:44.830 --> 02:30:49.154]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever.
[02:30:50.077 --> 02:30:51.398]  It's just crazy.
[02:30:51.398 --> 02:30:54.399]  So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[02:30:54.399 --> 02:30:58.521]  I would thank you for everything you've done for the Infowar, but I know you're like me.
[02:30:58.521 --> 02:31:00.442]  You don't want my thanks.
[02:31:00.442 --> 02:31:04.203]  You want victory over the globalists and these devil worship and child molesters.
[02:31:04.203 --> 02:31:06.404]  And you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[02:31:06.404 --> 02:31:07.585]  And you know what?
[02:31:07.585 --> 02:31:10.866]  I'm the same way and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[02:31:10.866 --> 02:31:15.208]  And it's why Infowars has been delivering time and time again when it's clutch time to
[02:31:17.475 --> 02:31:25.561]  Focus the people on taking action against the globalists, because I'm committed to a future for humanity, and I know you are as well.
[02:31:25.561 --> 02:31:33.668]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us, because you are the Infowar, and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[02:31:33.668 --> 02:31:42.355]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family, and from the great crew at Infowars, I want to thank you all because you are the Infowar, and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[02:31:43.419 --> 02:31:45.020]  You have made history.
[02:31:45.020 --> 02:31:46.901]  We have made history together.
[02:31:46.901 --> 02:31:51.484]  InfoWars.com only has power because of you.
[02:31:51.484 --> 02:31:54.025]  And I suggest you use it.
[02:31:54.025 --> 02:32:04.932]  If you understand why the globalists, why the servants of Satan, hate InfoWars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and we're not giving up.
[02:32:05.732 --> 02:32:15.223]  That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us.
[02:32:15.223 --> 02:32:19.787]  That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[02:32:19.787 --> 02:32:20.989]  The globalists have literally
[02:32:21.189 --> 02:32:21.429]  I'm good.
[02:32:43.930 --> 02:32:46.511]  They fear the fact that we are alive.
[02:32:46.511 --> 02:32:49.612]  They fear the fact that we love God.
[02:32:49.612 --> 02:32:57.475]  And that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[02:32:57.475 --> 02:33:00.136]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:33:06.116 --> 02:33:10.960]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:33:10.960 --> 02:33:12.641]  You want to stop tyranny?
[02:33:12.641 --> 02:33:14.302]  Well, so does he.
[02:33:14.302 --> 02:33:25.010]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:25.010 --> 02:33:30.353]  So, let me explain why this is so important.
[02:33:30.353 --> 02:33:31.054]  Then I'll go to your calls.
[02:33:32.947 --> 02:33:41.175]  We put out a report Friday, another Saturday, and another Sunday, where the head UN scientist says vaccines are killing people.
[02:33:41.175 --> 02:33:48.942]  We've been covering it up, and the majority of doctors think they're hurting people, and our front line is wobbly, and this cover-up's imploding.
[02:33:48.942 --> 02:33:58.111]  And then all the other scientists, in 20 hours, agree with her at a UN lead summit on vaccine safety in Switzerland.
[02:34:00.473 --> 02:34:05.496]  A handful of other Patriot sites pick it up.
[02:34:05.496 --> 02:34:08.758]  No mainstream news picks it up to even say we're lying.
[02:34:08.758 --> 02:34:11.059]  Total crickets.
[02:34:11.059 --> 02:34:13.220]  Just like they do on Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:34:13.220 --> 02:34:22.426]  Just like they do when we forgot the documents where they were planning race war and martial law under Obama with George Soros funding Antifa to try to trigger a race war.
[02:34:22.426 --> 02:34:25.928]  Actually says it.
[02:34:25.928 --> 02:34:27.869]  People couldn't believe it.
[02:34:30.384 --> 02:34:38.748]  Just like the caller earlier went and found the re-education camp document on the Army's website that Obama made them train to put American gun owners in camps.
[02:34:38.748 --> 02:34:41.490]  I know that sounds like it's not true.
[02:34:41.490 --> 02:34:43.551]  It's crazy!
[02:34:43.551 --> 02:34:53.235]  And now Project Veritas has video of Bernie operatives saying they're gonna burn down America and destroy the cops and cause civil war and put us in FEMA camps.
[02:34:53.235 --> 02:34:54.996]  That's their plan!
[02:34:54.996 --> 02:34:56.957]  That's what they're trying to do!
[02:34:56.957 --> 02:34:57.778]  That's what the head of Antifa
[02:34:59.488 --> 02:35:04.010]  Nationwide says they're planning!
[02:35:04.010 --> 02:35:05.550]  So I'm not going to hide in some bunker.
[02:35:05.550 --> 02:35:06.791]  I'm going to be all over the country.
[02:35:06.791 --> 02:35:07.891]  The RNC, the DNC.
[02:35:07.891 --> 02:35:11.313]  I'm going to be up there during the impeachment trial next week.
[02:35:11.313 --> 02:35:15.774]  I'm going to be in Virginia with the crew.
[02:35:15.774 --> 02:35:18.415]  Because this is America fighting for its life.
[02:35:18.415 --> 02:35:21.317]  And America's fought back from the brink of destruction.
[02:35:21.317 --> 02:35:22.657]  We've got a good chance to win this thing.
[02:35:22.657 --> 02:35:25.078]  But it's time to expose these people and get in their face.
[02:35:25.078 --> 02:35:27.379]  But you know what makes me physically sick to my stomach?
[02:35:29.704 --> 02:35:42.015]  People are so scared of being deplatformed that no one except National File and a few others even linked to our article or even did their own story with the Holy Grail.
[02:35:42.015 --> 02:35:54.026]  20 hours of scientists we linked to, 10-minute reports, 5-minute reports showing the highlights of the most incredible stuff ever that every state rep needs to see with Big Pharma trying to ban
[02:35:57.048 --> 02:35:58.328]  Refusal of vaccines.
[02:35:58.328 --> 02:36:06.671]  Trying to force you to take stuff that has liability protection, that has a history of damaging people, and now they want to say no one's allowed to criticize vaccines?
[02:36:06.671 --> 02:36:12.053]  That's saying you can't have medical consumer reports!
[02:36:12.053 --> 02:36:19.695]  And so, it's not just Google that won't show any of the InfoWars articles, or Band.Video stories.
[02:36:19.695 --> 02:36:22.776]  Even if you search the headline, it's blocked.
[02:36:22.776 --> 02:36:26.097]  But, the Liberty Movement itself self-censors.
[02:36:29.232 --> 02:36:30.815]  National File is scared.
[02:36:30.815 --> 02:36:32.778]  I'm sure they'll be punished and persecuted for it.
[02:36:32.778 --> 02:36:35.102]  They show up at the top when you search the exact headline.
[02:36:35.933 --> 02:36:37.534]  But not InfoWars.
[02:36:37.534 --> 02:37:05.474]  So think about the people at Google whose own children and own lives are being targeted by Big Pharma and it's horrible evil history of knowing drugs and products are going to hurt people and covering it up and now try to make it illegal to even criticize them or refuse products they want to put in us and the head scientist says it's killing people and there's a cover-up and the majority of the doctors are saying we're not going to do this anymore we see the bad effects and the head scientist over the whole vaccine program
[02:37:05.854 --> 02:37:08.895]  Says, in the video!
[02:37:08.895 --> 02:37:12.776]  As I tell the other scientists, do not use adjuvant.
[02:37:12.776 --> 02:37:16.277]  Unless you absolutely must, and then be very careful.
[02:37:16.277 --> 02:37:19.379]  The adjuvant is causing the death.
[02:37:19.379 --> 02:37:22.099]  The adjuvant is causing the autoimmune diseases.
[02:37:22.099 --> 02:37:25.901]  The adjuvant is causing people to have an allergic response.
[02:37:25.901 --> 02:37:27.681]  They are dying!
[02:37:27.681 --> 02:37:31.122]  I mean, it's all on video!
[02:37:31.122 --> 02:37:32.823]  And, there's a black hole of silence.
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:44.486]  Because Google's there, and Apple's there to cover up the pedophilia, and the devil worship, and the glyphosate, and the tainted vaccines, and all of it.
[02:37:44.486 --> 02:37:47.268]  And they're hitting on all cylinders, baby!
[02:37:47.268 --> 02:37:51.872]  You talk about Phantom Zone, hundreds of thousands of people have seen the videos at Man.Video.
[02:37:51.872 --> 02:37:52.112]  Great!
[02:37:54.909 --> 02:37:59.612]  Because you're not afraid to share it on your private email, on your text message.
[02:37:59.612 --> 02:38:01.113]  That's now starting to get censored.
[02:38:01.113 --> 02:38:12.059]  CNN called for my name and our articles to be digitally blocked by Apple and by Droid, which they can already do, where our links and my name and my voice can't be sent out.
[02:38:12.059 --> 02:38:14.781]  That's how powerful this AI is.
[02:38:14.781 --> 02:38:18.383]  Just like you try to upload a song instantly on YouTube, it stops your copyright.
[02:38:18.383 --> 02:38:22.646]  They can do that with any voice, any sound, and they say they're already doing it in China.
[02:38:25.421 --> 02:38:32.283]  And they think as you've seen me attacked and demonized and all this that you're going to get scared and back down and go away.
[02:38:32.283 --> 02:38:34.423]  They think, oh, I don't want to end up like Alex Jones.
[02:38:34.423 --> 02:38:35.763]  I better just keep my mouth shut.
[02:38:35.763 --> 02:38:37.224]  And then that way they win.
[02:38:37.224 --> 02:38:38.064]  You fight back.
[02:38:38.064 --> 02:38:38.804]  You speak out.
[02:38:38.804 --> 02:38:41.805]  They don't have a leg to stand on.
[02:38:41.805 --> 02:38:44.565]  Their own lead scientists are, we need research.
[02:38:44.565 --> 02:38:45.446]  We need testing.
[02:38:45.446 --> 02:38:46.586]  This is hurting people.
[02:38:46.586 --> 02:38:47.866]  This is a scandal.
[02:38:47.866 --> 02:38:49.266]  The public is angry at us.
[02:38:49.266 --> 02:38:51.087]  These videos are sensational.
[02:38:54.059 --> 02:38:59.181]  It'd be like having the cigarette makers going, we knew it's giving cancer and causing birth defects, but we covered it up.
[02:38:59.181 --> 02:39:01.202]  Nobody has that smoking gun.
[02:39:01.202 --> 02:39:09.805]  This is smoking gun.
[02:39:09.805 --> 02:39:13.767]  And you want to see who's got huevos?
[02:39:13.767 --> 02:39:16.668]  You go look at the list of who posted our video.
[02:39:16.668 --> 02:39:18.169]  But it's not even huevos, man.
[02:39:18.169 --> 02:39:22.450]  If you're getting attacked, fighting back isn't about being a hero, man.
[02:39:22.450 --> 02:39:23.551]  It's about wanting to live!
[02:39:25.663 --> 02:39:29.045]  So, Bird Box and Terminator, come with me if you want to live all this crap.
[02:39:29.045 --> 02:39:30.986]  Hey, don't come with me if you want to live.
[02:39:30.986 --> 02:39:32.227]  Let's get out of here together.
[02:39:32.227 --> 02:39:33.128]  Let's stop this.
[02:39:33.128 --> 02:39:34.268]  I need your help.
[02:39:34.268 --> 02:39:36.830]  I need you to live.
[02:39:36.830 --> 02:39:39.151]  I'm not sitting here telling you to do what I say if you want to live.
[02:39:39.151 --> 02:39:41.393]  I'm just saying, this is serious stuff, folks.
[02:39:41.393 --> 02:39:45.055]  We've proven it's real, and we've got to come together and figure out how to do this.
[02:39:45.055 --> 02:39:49.358]  And they hate this audience of activists because you're one of the only platforms big enough out there
[02:39:50.762 --> 02:39:56.267]  To have a 500,000 views, I looked at it this morning, is about what the three videos or four videos together have.
[02:39:56.267 --> 02:39:58.709]  500,000 views at Man.Video.
[02:39:58.709 --> 02:40:01.612]  It should be 500 million.
[02:40:01.612 --> 02:40:06.596]  And it'd be overnight.
[02:40:06.596 --> 02:40:13.482]  But see, the globalists know with this technology and all the stuff coming out, they can be brought down instantly as all their pedophilia stuff comes out.
[02:40:13.482 --> 02:40:14.944]  And so that's why the ADL said,
[02:40:17.045 --> 02:40:27.854]  We want computer live time blocking all live feeds by the general public where no one is allowed to go live on any platform except approved media outlets by us.
[02:40:27.854 --> 02:40:31.397]  I mean, that is just a freakishly criminal statement.
[02:40:31.397 --> 02:40:32.538]  Alright, I respect your calls.
[02:40:32.538 --> 02:40:35.300]  I just felt led to break all that down and I did.
[02:40:35.300 --> 02:40:40.224]  And I will get to every person before Owen Schroeder comes on.
[02:40:40.224 --> 02:40:42.426]  We got to get to all of you and I really appreciate you all holding.
[02:40:42.426 --> 02:40:43.487]  So let's just get started now.
[02:40:46.010 --> 02:40:50.353]  It's not just Google censoring us, it's us doing it to ourselves.
[02:40:50.353 --> 02:40:57.397]  And everybody needs to put the video on an iPad or on the phone and go and show people.
[02:40:57.397 --> 02:41:01.159]  Here's the head UN scientist saying this, now what are you going to do?
[02:41:01.159 --> 02:41:02.540]  Have viewing parties.
[02:41:02.540 --> 02:41:07.402]  If you're a mother and you've got friends, say, oh, I know we've heard about vaccines and questioning, it's bad.
[02:41:07.402 --> 02:41:09.984]  And so I agree, those anti-vaxxers are bad people.
[02:41:11.175 --> 02:41:12.876]  In fact, I found a really bad one.
[02:41:12.876 --> 02:41:14.217]  And I think you ought to see this lady.
[02:41:14.217 --> 02:41:16.138]  I think she ought to be sent to prison.
[02:41:16.138 --> 02:41:18.980]  And then just people go, that's the head of the UN saying it.
[02:41:18.980 --> 02:41:20.481]  That's the head scientist.
[02:41:20.481 --> 02:41:20.801]  I know.
[02:41:20.801 --> 02:41:22.582]  And there's a bunch of other ones saying it, too.
[02:41:22.582 --> 02:41:25.164]  They all need to be probably arrested and executed.
[02:41:25.164 --> 02:41:25.664]  Don't you agree?
[02:41:27.216 --> 02:41:28.436]  And just be satirical.
[02:41:28.436 --> 02:41:34.178]  Have some cookies and some tea, get your lady friends over and be like, you know I agree, anti-vaxxers need to be sent to prison.
[02:41:34.178 --> 02:41:40.120]  And I'm going to show you some that say there should be more testing, and that they're not safe, that people are dying, and wait until you see this criminal.
[02:41:40.120 --> 02:41:44.162]  They're going to be watching secret UN board meeting as they all admit everything.
[02:41:44.162 --> 02:41:51.524]  And then the very same scientist going, safe and effective, they're totally wonderful, and then they're going to go, uh, what?
[02:41:55.697 --> 02:41:56.819]  So that's what this comes down to.
[02:41:56.819 --> 02:42:00.383]  I mean, are you going to lay down and take this America and the world?
[02:42:00.383 --> 02:42:01.945]  I'm not taking it!
[02:42:01.945 --> 02:42:03.007]  My gosh!
[02:42:03.007 --> 02:42:09.936]  It should be so easy to defeat this!
[02:42:09.936 --> 02:42:11.418]  It should be so easy!
[02:42:12.671 --> 02:42:20.636]  With the history of Big Pharma, and all the bad drugs they put, and all the recalls, and all the admitted history of vaccines killing people, and now they're saying, that never happened.
[02:42:20.636 --> 02:42:21.877]  That's a conspiracy theory.
[02:42:21.877 --> 02:42:22.977]  No one's ever been hurt.
[02:42:22.977 --> 02:42:24.418]  No vaccine's ever been recalled.
[02:42:24.418 --> 02:42:25.719]  Safe and effective.
[02:42:25.719 --> 02:42:30.462]  Like we don't have memories, or all the thousands of news articles over the years.
[02:42:30.462 --> 02:42:34.224]  They're just making their move like we don't have memories.
[02:42:34.224 --> 02:42:37.546]  They're telling us the sun isn't yellow.
[02:42:37.546 --> 02:42:41.449]  They're telling us mama don't love us, and we can just kill babies after they're even born.
[02:42:42.847 --> 02:42:54.112]  And they've got weird big fat guys in priest outfits saying, we're here to teach your children about a wider, better world, and how to drink blood.
[02:42:54.112 --> 02:42:58.734]  It's either happened to every person listening, or it's happened to someone you know.
[02:42:59.796 --> 02:43:14.026]  Everybody is well aware of the fact that most people that end up getting the flu have taken the flu vaccine right before they get it, and they get the worst case of the flu of their life.
[02:43:14.026 --> 02:43:14.567]  But still,
[02:43:15.475 --> 02:43:22.936]  By concentration camp victims, they line up at the different pharmacies and clinics to get the injections.
[02:43:22.936 --> 02:43:34.078]  It doesn't matter that studies, mainline government studies in Canada and Europe show that when you take the flu vaccine, it doubles your chances of getting the flu the next season by lowering your immunity.
[02:43:34.078 --> 02:43:35.598]  It goes on and on.
[02:43:35.598 --> 02:43:43.780]  Or the fact that the governments have never guessed the next year's mutation, that the flu vaccine has never, ever even worked.
[02:43:44.420 --> 02:43:45.921]  But how do you prop up a hoax?
[02:43:45.921 --> 02:43:48.384]  You keep the giant hoax going.
[02:43:48.384 --> 02:43:53.749]  No wonder we've got one of the worst flu seasons on record happening right now.
[02:43:53.749 --> 02:43:55.931]  Hey, you there.
[02:43:55.931 --> 02:43:57.652]  We have a problem.
[02:43:57.652 --> 02:44:00.475]  You see, there is a baby.
[02:44:00.475 --> 02:44:04.358]  The mother of this baby is not sure she's ready.
[02:44:04.358 --> 02:44:07.421]  The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down.
[02:44:08.442 --> 02:44:11.243]  The mother starts to have regrets.
[02:44:11.243 --> 02:44:15.004]  The father considers leaving town.
[02:44:15.004 --> 02:44:18.345]  But a friend says there's a solution.
[02:44:18.345 --> 02:44:22.486]  She says to have an abortion.
[02:44:22.486 --> 02:44:24.387]  The mother decides to look into it.
[02:44:24.387 --> 02:44:27.468]  The clinic assures her it's safe.
[02:44:27.468 --> 02:44:29.248]  She's made her decision.
[02:44:29.248 --> 02:44:31.749]  She's going to have an abortion.
[02:44:31.749 --> 02:44:34.990]  The problem is that baby is you.
[02:44:38.021 --> 02:44:47.051]  Join me, Owen Schroyer, at the March for Life, Friday, January 24th, in Washington, D.C., noon, at the National Mall.
[02:44:47.051 --> 02:44:48.193]  I'll see you there.
[02:44:48.193 --> 02:44:50.655]  It's time to stand up for the unborn.
[02:44:50.655 --> 02:44:52.638]  It's time to speak out for the voiceless.
[02:44:54.815 --> 02:44:56.396]  InfowarStore.com.
[02:44:56.396 --> 02:45:02.701]  We have a new product, and we got several thousand of these in, and they're going to sell out in a few days at the rate we're selling them.
[02:45:02.701 --> 02:45:13.530]  I want to thank the listeners for getting it, but this really is a game-changing toothpaste, and it doesn't compete with Super Blue that's four to five colloidal silver and iodine and fluoride-free.
[02:45:14.505 --> 02:45:16.246]  The adult or the children's.
[02:45:16.246 --> 02:45:19.809]  These are both excellent toothpaste concentrates that don't have fillers.
[02:45:19.809 --> 02:45:20.710]  People love it.
[02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:28.836]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also remineralizes the teeth.
[02:45:29.577 --> 02:45:32.358]  Then it has the patented silver saw.
[02:45:32.358 --> 02:45:35.079]  Silver in it to knock out the bacteria that cause gingivitis.
[02:45:35.079 --> 02:45:35.899]  This is all proven.
[02:45:35.899 --> 02:45:37.439]  You can make claims with this.
[02:45:37.439 --> 02:45:48.622]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel.
[02:45:48.622 --> 02:45:49.983]  So, we're really proud of it.
[02:45:49.983 --> 02:45:50.903]  It funds the operation.
[02:45:50.903 --> 02:45:52.623]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:52.623 --> 02:45:54.264]  That's why we're still on air, thanks to you!
[02:45:55.985 --> 02:46:01.189]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[02:46:01.189 --> 02:46:05.492]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[02:46:05.492 --> 02:46:09.936]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[02:46:09.936 --> 02:46:18.342]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[02:46:18.342 --> 02:46:25.568]  Powerful, quiet, and effective, the Breeze uses a four-step purification process to help you breathe easier and cleaner.
[02:46:25.968 --> 02:46:29.591]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars.
[02:46:29.591 --> 02:46:34.895]  But the Alexa Pure Breeze air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.
[02:46:34.895 --> 02:46:42.962]  The breeze and the ion cluster patented technology used in the system eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.
[02:46:42.962 --> 02:46:48.346]  Get the Alexa Pure Breeze today and save big on a world-class air filtration system for your home.
[02:46:48.346 --> 02:46:50.628]  Don't keep breathing toxic or dangerous air.
[02:46:50.628 --> 02:46:52.649]  Get this special today at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:46:56.949 --> 02:47:03.913]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:03.913 --> 02:47:09.377]  You have to do every single thing I say or we will not make it.
[02:47:09.377 --> 02:47:09.997]  Understand?
[02:47:09.997 --> 02:47:12.018]  Do you understand?
[02:47:12.018 --> 02:47:13.659]  Come with me if you want to live.
[02:47:13.659 --> 02:47:14.920]  Come with me if you want to live.
[02:47:14.920 --> 02:47:20.844]  I don't want to interrupt when I'm leaving.
[02:47:22.170 --> 02:47:23.230]  You've been doing great, Owen.
[02:47:23.230 --> 02:47:26.051]  You're going to finish up with these calls within Gregory's.
[02:47:26.051 --> 02:47:28.931]  And, of course, Harris and Smith are going to take another hour of calls.
[02:47:28.931 --> 02:47:30.512]  The crew's volunteered to do it.
[02:47:30.512 --> 02:47:33.952]  So we're here, live covering this, hoping everything de-escalates.
[02:47:33.952 --> 02:47:35.212]  So the live coverage continues.
[02:47:35.212 --> 02:47:36.553]  Everybody spread those links.
[02:47:36.553 --> 02:47:38.913]  The Globals are hacking us, trying to shut this down.
[02:47:38.913 --> 02:47:39.653]  Don't let them win.
[02:47:39.653 --> 02:47:40.553]  No BS.
[02:47:40.553 --> 02:47:42.374]  I'm going to tell you, everything's straight shooting here.
[02:47:42.374 --> 02:47:44.814]  See, I don't have some Machiavelli manipulative view.
[02:47:44.814 --> 02:47:47.035]  With me, it's all straightforward attack.
[02:47:47.035 --> 02:47:48.195]  That's the real power!
[02:47:49.332 --> 02:47:52.435]  Don't act so surprised, Globalist.
[02:47:52.435 --> 02:47:56.238]  You didn't think you could silence the American people, did you?
[02:47:56.238 --> 02:48:00.181]  Join Bandot Video, and I will complete your training.
[02:48:00.181 --> 02:48:09.749]  Together, we can overthrow the Emperor and restore the Republic.
[02:48:09.749 --> 02:48:11.411]  Well, it's like Darth Vader's on our team.
[02:48:12.429 --> 02:48:14.210]  Now Snopes will fact-check that.
[02:48:14.210 --> 02:48:16.751]  Jones claims Darth Vader's on their team.
[02:48:16.751 --> 02:48:19.091]  Hey, Darth Vader's not a real person.
[02:48:19.091 --> 02:48:24.633]  He's a fictional character created by George Lucas.
[02:48:24.633 --> 02:48:30.335]  Did you know Snopes and all them now fact-check memes and jokes?
[02:48:30.335 --> 02:48:32.036]  The pretentiousness of these people.
[02:48:32.967 --> 02:48:35.690]  And now they're trying to confuse the public.
[02:48:35.690 --> 02:48:37.211]  They're betting on you being stupid.
[02:48:37.211 --> 02:48:38.292]  I'm betting on you being smart.
[02:48:38.292 --> 02:48:40.494]  Okay, we've got a bunch of incredible callers.
[02:48:40.494 --> 02:48:41.415]  And I appreciate you calling in.
[02:48:41.415 --> 02:48:45.138]  I went back to my old self of getting the phones loaded and then ranting.
[02:48:45.138 --> 02:48:46.319]  But I gotta add one more thing.
[02:48:46.319 --> 02:48:48.041]  On the vaccines.
[02:48:48.041 --> 02:48:48.601]  And I'm gonna stop.
[02:48:48.601 --> 02:48:51.524]  But I notice a lot of calls are on that.
[02:48:51.524 --> 02:48:52.185]  Because they're coming.
[02:48:52.185 --> 02:48:53.486]  All the world before is inoculation.
[02:48:53.486 --> 02:48:54.467]  It's just people are waking up.
[02:48:57.029 --> 02:49:04.033]  50 years ago in New Guinea or places in Africa or wherever, people went up to the white witch doctors and they wanted shots.
[02:49:04.033 --> 02:49:05.194]  They wanted help.
[02:49:05.194 --> 02:49:05.834]  Now they run.
[02:49:05.834 --> 02:49:10.256]  My baby die at the shot.
[02:49:10.256 --> 02:49:12.437]  Her baby die at the shot.
[02:49:12.437 --> 02:49:14.539]  They don't need medical degrees to know what's going on.
[02:49:14.539 --> 02:49:18.861]  And then in Africa and India, they test the shot and they find what they're adding to it.
[02:49:18.861 --> 02:49:19.621]  Hormones.
[02:49:19.621 --> 02:49:22.063]  So your body creates an autoimmune response to the hormone.
[02:49:22.063 --> 02:49:26.005]  So then your body has an autoimmune response attacking your ovaries.
[02:49:28.117 --> 02:49:34.280]  That's the woman's huevos.
[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:36.221]  That's what Gardasil attacks, that's what it all does.
[02:49:36.221 --> 02:49:52.628]  And so understand this, I remember like 10 years ago, the H1N1 virus, they admitted that it was a live virus, not attenuated, live engineered, but to quote, not hurt you, so they could quote, track it to the next year that you had the giant H1N1 outbreak, because it mutated into something bad.
[02:49:52.628 --> 02:49:54.308]  It was all planned!
[02:49:54.308 --> 02:49:57.490]  Now they're putting out, they approved a month ago, a month ago.
[02:49:58.268 --> 02:50:00.911]  It was in the middle of December.
[02:50:00.911 --> 02:50:03.253]  Live Ebola vaccines.
[02:50:03.253 --> 02:50:06.277]  People are taking them here in the U.S.
[02:50:06.277 --> 02:50:07.057]  It's shits!
[02:50:13.122 --> 02:50:17.725]  It sheds the bullet, and you get it, and they have no freaking idea what it's gonna do.
[02:50:17.725 --> 02:50:23.069]  Big Pharma, Bill and Melinda Gates, say just take it and trust us, it's genetically engineered.
[02:50:23.069 --> 02:50:30.075]  And then the UN says in their own videos, they go, we're not testing any of this, we just believe them, and we don't have any studies, and we don't know.
[02:50:30.075 --> 02:50:32.757]  They don't even know what the adjuvants are doing, but they do.
[02:50:33.803 --> 02:50:41.406]  But now, all these big sinister big pharma companies, those are the folks that brought you Hitler, his main financiers, literally, look it up.
[02:50:41.406 --> 02:50:47.828]  They have something special for you that an electron microscope can't read.
[02:50:47.828 --> 02:50:49.369]  Little something special they made.
[02:50:49.369 --> 02:50:54.571]  And if you try to sue them, they go, oh, CRISPR is patented and proprietary.
[02:50:54.571 --> 02:50:55.811]  We're not going to let you know.
[02:50:55.811 --> 02:51:02.854]  And anyone that ever tries to scan, because they have other machines like CRISPR now, an Italian firm was last year trying to scan
[02:51:04.682 --> 02:51:10.572]  Some of these vaccines read what they've done and they got SWAT teamed.
[02:51:10.572 --> 02:51:11.593]  Oh no, no, no.
[02:51:11.593 --> 02:51:13.416]  Turns out they were being watched and listened to.
[02:51:14.514 --> 02:51:32.889]  That's what all the surveillance grid's about, to make sure you don't find out what Bill Gates, whose dad headed up Planned Parenthood and was involved in Cold Springs Harbor and secret genetics operations, wants to put something in you so bad, it makes him smile and a little twinkle in his eye.
[02:51:32.889 --> 02:51:34.711]  Oh, it's so liberal.
[02:51:34.711 --> 02:51:36.032]  Oh, it's so laughing.
[02:51:36.032 --> 02:51:37.953]  And Tim Cook cares about you too.
[02:51:38.894 --> 02:51:41.276]  That nice little smile all the time.
[02:51:41.276 --> 02:51:42.517]  He's so happy.
[02:51:42.517 --> 02:51:44.478]  Wears little sweaters.
[02:51:44.478 --> 02:51:46.059]  Bill Gates a little elf.
[02:51:46.059 --> 02:51:47.760]  Oh, hi!
[02:51:47.760 --> 02:51:53.124]  And then he goes up on TED TV and goes, oh, humans are the problem.
[02:51:53.124 --> 02:51:57.827]  Here's my equation to bring humans down to zero and save the Earth.
[02:51:57.827 --> 02:52:01.850]  And the cool trendies at TED TV, they all go, oh!
[02:52:04.051 --> 02:52:04.311]  I don't
[02:52:21.976 --> 02:52:26.638]  Some of his graduate students that work in bioweapons came out and attacked me and said he's a great man.
[02:52:26.638 --> 02:52:29.039]  He only wants to kill 90%.
[02:52:29.039 --> 02:52:31.920]  Who can disagree that we need to kill all the humans?
[02:52:31.920 --> 02:52:34.401]  We're a plague and a parasite!
[02:52:34.401 --> 02:52:36.142]  Kill everyone!
[02:52:36.142 --> 02:52:40.444]  Kill everyone!
[02:52:40.444 --> 02:52:42.785]  Now, they weren't acting like that when they said that.
[02:52:42.785 --> 02:52:46.306]  That's what these Hellraisers pulling their eyeballs out.
[02:52:46.306 --> 02:52:49.708]  Pizza children to chop their genitals off.
[02:52:49.708 --> 02:52:49.868]  I mean,
[02:52:51.724 --> 02:52:54.525]  Bianca's top graduate student.
[02:52:54.525 --> 02:52:55.186]  We looked her up.
[02:52:55.186 --> 02:52:56.046]  She came out and attacked me.
[02:52:56.046 --> 02:53:01.669]  She's like, we're gonna get rid of all the humans who can deny that we are a parasite and a scourge and destroying us.
[02:53:01.669 --> 02:53:03.070]  I mean, about getting the transmission.
[02:53:03.070 --> 02:53:05.271]  She's like, I will destroy the humans.
[02:53:05.271 --> 02:53:06.132]  Destroy the humans.
[02:53:06.132 --> 02:53:07.132]  Give me weapons.
[02:53:07.132 --> 02:53:07.752]  I'll kill them.
[02:53:09.053 --> 02:53:14.818]  I mean, they're avataring into these people, and these are like space marines is the best I can figure it out.
[02:53:14.818 --> 02:53:22.765]  And they're just, there's nobody home, there's a damn demon, whatever it is, wants to kill everybody, and they want into the bio-weapons.
[02:53:22.765 --> 02:53:30.291]  Just like 13 or 12 monkeys or whatever it is.
[02:53:30.291 --> 02:53:36.437]  And then you go to Bianca's website, and he's a druid priest, talking about Lucifer.
[02:53:47.833 --> 02:53:51.678]  So again, we are two minutes to midnight, folks.
[02:53:51.678 --> 02:53:55.323]  And these psychotics want mass collapse.
[02:53:55.323 --> 02:53:56.385]  And they want us off the air.
[02:53:56.385 --> 02:53:59.128]  Because they don't want people to get warned ahead of it happening.
[02:53:59.128 --> 02:54:02.333]  Because if people get warned ahead of it happening, they'll get the blame as they should.
[02:54:02.333 --> 02:54:05.477]  Alright, I'm gonna go to your calls now.
[02:54:07.606 --> 02:54:20.993]  10 to 21, taking action, medical tyranny, the camps, medical tyranny, support in force, Trump, deep state, this info, FEMA camps, we're good to go.
[02:54:20.993 --> 02:54:27.076]  Every person holding, I know it's a job for the folks in there, get their name and number too, they're all getting a free t-shirt of their choice.
[02:54:27.076 --> 02:54:30.577]  Or just, I'll have customer service call them, we'll get a t-shirt, okay?
[02:54:30.577 --> 02:54:34.720]  I'm getting better about taking the calls, I just, you gotta talk about this stuff.
[02:54:34.720 --> 02:54:35.480]  I mean, you gotta do it.
[02:54:38.066 --> 02:54:44.028]  I look at photos of that girl that had been his graduate student, you know, a decade before, and now she works at a government bioweapons lab.
[02:54:44.028 --> 02:55:04.476]  I remember, and I found other photos of her online, and she's like in white lab coats going like... And I'm just saying, what's wrong with these people?
[02:55:05.759 --> 02:55:08.361]  Well, if you believe the Bible, they're demonic, like space marines.
[02:55:08.361 --> 02:55:10.123]  They're here to wipe us out.
[02:55:10.123 --> 02:55:11.184]  You wonder why they act like that?
[02:55:11.184 --> 02:55:12.405]  They're running around going, kill, kill, kill.
[02:55:12.405 --> 02:55:14.607]  That's what marines do.
[02:55:14.607 --> 02:55:17.890]  I mean, it's like Mars attacks.
[02:55:17.890 --> 02:55:18.410]  Don't run.
[02:55:18.410 --> 02:55:19.471]  We are your friends.
[02:55:19.471 --> 02:55:24.495]  And I just say it's aliens because they act like it.
[02:55:24.495 --> 02:55:26.397]  They always talk about us like they're not human.
[02:55:26.397 --> 02:55:28.139]  Like, we must destroy the humans.
[02:55:28.139 --> 02:55:29.059]  They are bad.
[02:55:29.059 --> 02:55:31.141]  It's like, you're an effing white male.
[02:55:31.141 --> 02:55:32.162]  And that guy's a white male.
[02:55:32.162 --> 02:55:32.643]  It's the same.
[02:55:32.643 --> 02:55:32.923]  It's like,
[02:55:35.063 --> 02:55:36.443]  The humans must be eradicated!
[02:55:36.443 --> 02:55:38.024]  Now your planet is ours!
[02:55:38.024 --> 02:55:41.045]  I mean, I've even seen leftists suddenly say that, and they're like, one, they go, ha, ha!
[02:55:41.045 --> 02:55:42.666]  And you're like, whoa, dude!
[02:55:42.666 --> 02:55:48.007]  They're like, ha, ha, ha!
[02:55:48.007 --> 02:55:54.329]  But see, aliens couldn't get away with it if they were flying around and flying saucers, but when they're jumping into you.
[02:55:54.329 --> 02:55:58.151]  And notice, none of the media will pick this up and say, Jones thinks Martians are possessing people.
[02:55:58.151 --> 02:55:59.071]  It's an allegory.
[02:56:00.248 --> 02:56:05.332]  All I'm saying is, they might as well be aliens here to destroy us and kill us, because that's what they're doing!
[02:56:05.332 --> 02:56:07.654]  And they're creating aliens in the lab!
[02:56:07.654 --> 02:56:12.739]  Things that have never existed before, that are DEADLY!
[02:56:12.739 --> 02:56:17.422]  They have meddled with the tidal forces of nature!
[02:56:17.422 --> 02:56:21.906]  And they will atone!
[02:56:21.906 --> 02:56:25.289]  I got your attention now, Mr. Beale.
[02:56:25.289 --> 02:56:26.230]  And I'm not like, uh...
[02:56:28.795 --> 02:56:30.256]  Stephen King that plagiarizes everything.
[02:56:30.256 --> 02:56:34.720]  That's from the movie Network.
[02:56:34.720 --> 02:56:37.722]  Yeah, they just derailed a business deal, Mr. Beagle.
[02:56:37.722 --> 02:56:44.467]  You get up there every night in a little 24-inch box and you tell everybody about nations and people.
[02:56:44.467 --> 02:56:45.868]  There are no more nations.
[02:56:45.868 --> 02:56:48.370]  There are no more people.
[02:56:48.370 --> 02:56:52.474]  There's only the great ecumenical system of stock in each of us.
[02:56:53.829 --> 02:56:58.351]  Isn't just holding a piece of stock, you are stock, Mr. Beale.
[02:56:58.351 --> 02:57:04.714]  You're a human resource, and we're about to make you obsolete, Mr. Beale.
[02:57:04.714 --> 02:57:09.936]  And because we've been let in on this, we feel superior, Mr. Beale.
[02:57:09.936 --> 02:57:19.501]  But the truth is, I'm a humanoid collaborator, and I am the worst of the worst, and I will be destroyed by the big boss.
[02:57:19.501 --> 02:57:20.761]  I was speaking for him.
[02:57:20.761 --> 02:57:21.702]  That's not me speaking for myself.
[02:57:25.871 --> 02:57:28.074]  I'm alive and I'm resisting it.
[02:57:28.074 --> 02:57:30.097]  What about you?
[02:57:30.097 --> 02:57:32.219]  They want to inject you with live Ebola.
[02:57:32.219 --> 02:57:33.621]  They say it won't hurt you.
[02:57:33.621 --> 02:57:37.486]  And even if you don't like it, don't worry, it spreads.
[02:57:37.486 --> 02:57:39.929]  But anyways, it's liberal.
[02:57:39.929 --> 02:57:41.011]  It's liberal.
[02:57:43.499 --> 02:57:45.722]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:57:45.722 --> 02:57:47.945]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:57:47.945 --> 02:57:49.968]  Infowarslife.com.
[02:57:49.968 --> 02:57:59.240]  You go to that URL, it takes you to the subsection of Infowarsstore.com where you find the 60 plus products where we've gone out and researched what is the best,
[02:57:59.861 --> 02:58:01.622]  Well, it gives people the best results.
[02:58:01.622 --> 02:58:05.345]  We either private label it or we develop our own with top developers.
[02:58:05.345 --> 02:58:10.209]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[02:58:10.209 --> 02:58:13.112]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[02:58:13.112 --> 02:58:14.032]  It's incredible.
[02:58:14.032 --> 02:58:15.694]  So do yourself a favor.
[02:58:15.694 --> 02:58:18.176]  Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[02:58:18.176 --> 02:58:21.078]  You can't lose, except if you don't take action.
[02:58:21.078 --> 02:58:25.722]  Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering.
[02:58:25.722 --> 02:58:28.024]  Thanks to your support and God's grace and our action.
[02:58:28.604 --> 02:58:29.885]  But you need these products.
[02:58:29.885 --> 02:58:32.947]  That's the real reason you want to get them, is because they're amazing.
[02:58:32.947 --> 02:58:36.869]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it, word of mouth.
[02:58:36.869 --> 02:58:40.712]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO, instead of imploding.
[02:58:40.712 --> 02:58:44.894]  We're fighting to win, and we are winning, thanks to you.
[02:58:44.894 --> 02:58:46.775]  You want to break some globalist ribs.
[02:58:46.775 --> 02:58:48.596]  You want to crush some skulls politically.
[02:58:48.596 --> 02:58:52.119]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs, spiritually.
[02:58:52.119 --> 02:58:54.160]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[02:58:54.160 --> 02:58:55.721]  There's nowhere you can place your bet.
[02:58:57.338 --> 02:58:57.818]  in a fight
[02:59:27.418 --> 02:59:29.359]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:00:01.817 --> 03:00:11.182]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:11.182 --> 03:00:19.166]  That's what Big Brother says.
[03:00:19.166 --> 03:00:23.888]  They say, hey, you're not taking my daughter out tonight.
[03:00:23.888 --> 03:00:27.410]  Because, well, you tell my daughter not to get on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane.
[03:00:27.410 --> 03:00:30.612]  And I'm a good, trendy, I want my daughter to do whatever Jeffrey Epstein says.
[03:00:32.188 --> 03:00:33.228]  Is that what happens?
[03:00:33.228 --> 03:00:35.529]  Crank it up for a minute.
[03:00:35.529 --> 03:00:36.990]  FATHER!
[03:00:36.990 --> 03:00:39.991]  You're gonna show her my world!
[03:00:39.991 --> 03:00:53.697]  I'm asking all of us, do you really want to bang heads?
[03:00:53.697 --> 03:00:56.858]  Because we are gonna bang heads.
[03:00:56.858 --> 03:00:59.059]  And we are banging heads.
[03:00:59.059 --> 03:01:00.140]  And we are winning.
[03:01:03.201 --> 03:01:04.562]  Alright, let's go ahead and go to your calls.
[03:01:04.562 --> 03:01:06.744]  I'm a bad person, I apologize.
[03:01:06.744 --> 03:01:08.385]  A little bit wound up today.
[03:01:08.385 --> 03:01:10.087]  Have you had that much coffee?
[03:01:10.087 --> 03:01:13.749]  Nothing pisses me off like reading vaccine inserts and all the science.
[03:01:13.749 --> 03:01:18.213]  And they're putting Lava Bowl out and it sheds onto us and God knows what it's going to do.
[03:01:18.213 --> 03:01:23.477]  And they're just going to try to practice covering it up and see how much soft killing they can get away with.
[03:01:25.836 --> 03:01:28.238]  And so there's only so much anger I can have.
[03:01:28.238 --> 03:01:32.522]  The body starts tempering it with laughter and comedic so you don't go crazy.
[03:01:33.598 --> 03:01:38.639]  That's why really aggressive killing behavior is associated sometimes with laughing.
[03:01:38.639 --> 03:01:42.440]  Because the brain is governing it in between the attacks.
[03:01:42.440 --> 03:01:44.220]  That's what's going on with my psychology right now.
[03:01:44.220 --> 03:01:49.301]  I'm actually really pissed and I'm trying to transmit anger and action to everyone.
[03:01:49.301 --> 03:02:01.363]  To take action with your voice and say no to these tyrants and override them and stop them before they normalize openly killing us with vaccines, not bullets!
[03:02:01.363 --> 03:02:02.883]  Alright?
[03:02:04.301 --> 03:02:05.542]  Lucas, you're on the air.
[03:02:05.542 --> 03:02:06.183]  Thanks for holding.
[03:02:06.183 --> 03:02:07.644]  Go ahead.
[03:02:07.644 --> 03:02:09.165]  Hey, Alex Jones, man.
[03:02:09.165 --> 03:02:10.046]  Nice talking to you, man.
[03:02:10.046 --> 03:02:14.510]  Hey, I just wanted to point out the flu vaccine situation.
[03:02:14.510 --> 03:02:17.492]  Thank you for confirming that and putting it on your show.
[03:02:17.492 --> 03:02:19.554]  Also, I want to say, man, God bless your show.
[03:02:19.554 --> 03:02:20.915]  God bless what you do.
[03:02:20.915 --> 03:02:22.336]  You know, me and my father, we tune in.
[03:02:22.336 --> 03:02:25.359]  We're true supporters of God.
[03:02:25.359 --> 03:02:26.860]  Yes, amen.
[03:02:26.860 --> 03:02:28.682]  And also, man, I'm a Christian just like you, man.
[03:02:28.682 --> 03:02:32.605]  But back in 2017, man, I was working for a cable company here out of Kansas.
[03:02:33.254 --> 03:02:36.957]  And there's a dialysis center that we had to go do some cable work for, man.
[03:02:36.957 --> 03:02:47.504]  And upon entry to go do our job, the dialysis center told us that we cannot enter the facility without taking a flu shot if we haven't had one in the past couple years.
[03:02:47.504 --> 03:02:52.288]  Well, me personally, I won't take a flu shot or any kind of vaccinations having in at least 10 plus years.
[03:02:52.968 --> 03:02:57.590]  I've always had in the back of my head this little voice telling me that that's population control, man.
[03:02:57.590 --> 03:03:13.696]  Every time they urge you to corral cattle through these little organizations, these blood drives or these Red Cross or whatever little mobile units, to me in my mind, man, anything that's like that, that's got to do with medicine and vaccinations and stuff, it's a way to
[03:03:15.014 --> 03:03:21.777]  Bring people in and- Well, sorry, sir, it has a long history of secret testing, even killing people.
[03:03:21.777 --> 03:03:25.878]  And some of the average medical workers like that, but the people involved in it are very evil.
[03:03:25.878 --> 03:03:27.539]  They believe that it injustifies the means.
[03:03:27.539 --> 03:03:30.420]  They're told, oh, this test will save millions if you do it.
[03:03:30.420 --> 03:03:31.540]  So they hurt people.
[03:03:31.540 --> 03:03:34.061]  But the truth is, a lot of them are psychotic and like to do it.
[03:03:34.061 --> 03:03:35.422]  So your instincts are on target.
[03:03:36.178 --> 03:03:37.679]  Man, absolutely, man.
[03:03:37.679 --> 03:03:42.942]  I appreciate you for confirming that, man, because people, all my friends, man, people I've known for a long time always thought, man, you're crazy.
[03:03:42.942 --> 03:03:54.390]  You're on these conspiracy theories and stuff, and, you know, yeah, you call me crazy, but, you know... Well, sir, you can give them the head UN scientist and her adjuncts saying that it's killing people and they're covering it up.
[03:03:55.287 --> 03:03:56.308]  Yeah, absolutely, man.
[03:03:56.308 --> 03:04:01.491]  And if you look back to history, 150, 200 years ago, there wasn't all these vaccinations.
[03:04:01.491 --> 03:04:05.134]  People wasn't going to these little locations and getting these shots every year.
[03:04:05.134 --> 03:04:06.074]  It didn't even exist.
[03:04:06.074 --> 03:04:08.036]  It wasn't even, you know, thought of at the time.
[03:04:08.036 --> 03:04:14.560]  Yeah, the same governments that want you to abort your baby and have your son's genitals cut off really want you to take all these shots.
[03:04:14.560 --> 03:04:17.442]  And when you look into it, they don't do anything they say they're going to do.
[03:04:17.442 --> 03:04:20.945]  All they do is screw you up and make you sicker and make you dumb and make you die.
[03:04:21.698 --> 03:04:22.919]  Absolutely, and they're sick, man.
[03:04:22.919 --> 03:04:27.941]  And one more thing I want to touch on, I know you got other people to talk to, is this pedophile ring, man.
[03:04:27.941 --> 03:04:28.661]  It's crazy, man.
[03:04:28.661 --> 03:04:36.025]  I just did a little stint, man, of incarceration, and this whole time I was incarcerated, I just got out not too long ago, but this time while I was incarcerated, I learned a lot, man.
[03:04:36.025 --> 03:04:41.687]  I got closer to God, and I was also watching the news and this MSM and the propaganda bullshit.
[03:04:41.687 --> 03:04:49.211]  But while I was in jail here in Kansas, I noticed, man, that people like me who have, you know, lesser charges that are, you know, I don't know,

[03:06:02.770 --> 03:06:07.973]  I wonder what ZZ Top thinks about the new role order.
[03:06:29.682 --> 03:06:32.645]  I think I have a good idea.
[03:06:32.645 --> 03:06:37.629]  Okay, let's go to more of your phone calls.
[03:06:37.629 --> 03:06:38.350]  You have been holding.
[03:06:38.350 --> 03:06:39.051]  You are awesome.
[03:06:39.051 --> 03:06:40.272]  I appreciate you.
[03:06:40.272 --> 03:06:45.797]  Joseph in Ohio has been holding, talking about medical tyranny.
[03:06:45.797 --> 03:06:46.538]  Joseph, welcome.
[03:06:46.538 --> 03:06:48.259]  Tell us your story.
[03:06:48.259 --> 03:06:49.981]  How you doing, Mr. Jones?
[03:06:49.981 --> 03:06:52.183]  I've been a listener for about seven years.
[03:06:52.183 --> 03:06:54.445]  I've tried a bunch of your products, but I'm going to get right to it.
[03:06:56.089 --> 03:07:03.433]  We have been listening to your show for a while and I've been getting all your information about the vaccines and stuff and it scared us a lot.
[03:07:03.433 --> 03:07:11.817]  And we brought this up to the pediatrician and said, you know, if we wanted to opt out, you know, could we do that?
[03:07:11.817 --> 03:07:17.480]  She said, you can opt out, but we wouldn't be able to see you in this office anymore.
[03:07:17.480 --> 03:07:23.543]  So I was looking for a holistic doctor and they're insanely expensive.
[03:07:25.703 --> 03:07:26.444]  Oh yeah, no, no.
[03:07:26.444 --> 03:07:28.685]  I mean, they used to hand out cigarettes free to the kids.
[03:07:28.685 --> 03:07:29.526]  That's how they get you hooked.
[03:07:29.526 --> 03:07:36.170]  That's why the crack dealers, you know, come and give the first dosages of crack out free or first shots of heroin or fentanyl.
[03:07:36.170 --> 03:07:45.236]  What you search engine is doctors that accept vaccine waivers or local doctors that
[03:07:46.414 --> 03:07:46.754]  I don't
[03:08:07.543 --> 03:08:07.943]  I think?
[03:08:29.876 --> 03:08:31.837]  I'm thinking about going public with this.
[03:08:31.837 --> 03:08:35.339]  He told me this in confidence, but I think I may just say the name of the place.
[03:08:35.339 --> 03:08:36.200]  No, no, I can't do that.
[03:08:36.200 --> 03:08:39.602]  The point is, he goes, oh, yeah, the vaccines are full of cancer viruses.
[03:08:39.602 --> 03:08:46.406]  Oh, yeah, we have to do this inner service stuff where they make us go out and give the vaccines, you know, the poor kids.
[03:08:46.406 --> 03:08:47.367]  And he said we would.
[03:08:48.047 --> 03:08:53.971]  They were giving him a live polio vaccine, Alex, that's illegal from the 1970s that has cancer virus.
[03:08:53.971 --> 03:08:55.251]  I go, yeah, SV40.
[03:08:55.251 --> 03:08:56.012]  He said, yeah.
[03:08:56.012 --> 03:08:58.093]  Then I turned away and he grabbed me by the arm.
[03:08:58.093 --> 03:09:00.254]  He said, but you don't tell people I told you that.
[03:09:00.254 --> 03:09:00.775]  I said, listen.
[03:09:02.093 --> 03:09:02.953]  You already know that?
[03:09:02.953 --> 03:09:05.174]  I don't need to tell people you told me that.
[03:09:05.174 --> 03:09:08.616]  But I mean, we almost, you know, he was a big guy too.
[03:09:08.616 --> 03:09:11.317]  But the point is, is that we kind of almost got into it.
[03:09:11.317 --> 03:09:16.039]  Because he's telling me he knows all this, but then realizes, well, then he's scared.
[03:09:16.039 --> 03:09:22.042]  Don't tell people that the guy that founded the biggest pediatric, you know, thing in Austin, you know, knows all this stuff.
[03:09:22.042 --> 03:09:29.185]  And then I got to sit there with that pig woman doctor that bought the clinics because my wife happened to get the head witch.
[03:09:30.546 --> 03:09:34.470]  What I was thinking about doing was just because they've had their first round
[03:09:54.723 --> 03:10:06.366]  Um, and I was thinking I should just, like, lie and say that they're having, like, some kind of compulsions or seizures or something like that, you know, but I never reported it and then see what they tell me.
[03:10:06.366 --> 03:10:08.747]  Sir, you don't want to do that.
[03:10:08.747 --> 03:10:12.268]  There are all sorts of doctors' offices and clinics everywhere that have them.
[03:10:12.808 --> 03:10:15.530]  And you don't need them, and there's waivers.
[03:10:15.530 --> 03:10:16.230]  It's not a law.
[03:10:16.230 --> 03:10:18.672]  They make you do the waiver, though, to make you feel like you're a criminal.
[03:10:18.672 --> 03:10:21.233]  That's just to even get them into school or daycare, sir.
[03:10:21.233 --> 03:10:30.739]  I mean, it's just, please, for God's sakes, you have areas where you don't have to get that done, okay?
[03:10:30.739 --> 03:10:32.380]  Also, can I plug a product?
[03:10:32.380 --> 03:10:35.042]  Yes, sir, go ahead.
[03:10:35.042 --> 03:10:40.525]  You guys, I haven't even heard of it for a while, but the Oxy-Powder, I did like a five or a seven-day
[03:10:41.241 --> 03:10:47.762]  Liver Cleanse with it and what came out of me was like some out of like an Aliens movie or something.
[03:10:47.762 --> 03:10:48.943]  It was like gallstones.
[03:10:48.943 --> 03:10:49.483]  I looked at it.
[03:10:49.483 --> 03:10:51.523]  Yeah, no, Dr. Group won't let us private label that.
[03:10:51.523 --> 03:10:53.023]  That's his biggest product.
[03:10:53.023 --> 03:10:57.344]  It's world famous and it's just concentrated oxygen.
[03:10:57.344 --> 03:10:59.665]  It's a higher level oxygen that breaks down.
[03:10:59.665 --> 03:11:03.786]  And if you do a six, seven day liver cleanse, we sell it in fullrestore.com.
[03:11:03.786 --> 03:11:07.726]  And then you take the liver cleanse, you know, stuff while you're doing it.
[03:11:07.726 --> 03:11:09.927]  And then you, you, you, you know, you drink the
[03:11:10.487 --> 03:11:12.548]  Apple cider vinegar and do all the things they say.
[03:11:12.548 --> 03:11:14.389]  It's not hard to do.
[03:11:14.389 --> 03:11:17.911]  It's the little green balls and that's in your gallbladder.
[03:11:17.911 --> 03:11:23.134]  And that's basically where your liver transmits all that toxin and garbage into there.
[03:11:23.134 --> 03:11:26.456]  But a lot of times it's all compacted inside the gallbladder.
[03:11:26.456 --> 03:11:28.057]  And so that's when the gallbladder explodes.
[03:11:28.057 --> 03:11:28.897]  So you have all those problems.
[03:11:28.897 --> 03:11:29.517]  So yeah.
[03:11:29.517 --> 03:11:31.979]  Is that what happened to you?
[03:11:31.979 --> 03:11:32.359]  Yeah.
[03:11:32.359 --> 03:11:38.202]  Well, you know, I just wanted to detox because I was drinking a little too much, you know, throughout the past years.
[03:11:38.202 --> 03:11:39.623]  And I wanted to just do a detox.
[03:11:40.655 --> 03:11:45.498]  Man, I tried that stuff and it was, I just felt like a new man.
[03:11:45.498 --> 03:11:47.159]  I felt like... Absolutely.
[03:11:47.159 --> 03:11:50.701]  No, I mean, listen, we don't sell stuff unless it's absolutely kick-ass.
[03:11:50.701 --> 03:11:55.103]  I mean, our fish oil is the very best fish oil you're going to find out there.
[03:11:55.103 --> 03:12:01.606]  We're the three best types, the krill oil, the nord, the natural healthy salmon, and the anchovies.
[03:12:01.606 --> 03:12:05.008]  And then it's had the expensive process of any mercury being removed.
[03:12:05.008 --> 03:12:07.510]  And then it's big old juicy horse pills of this stuff.
[03:12:07.510 --> 03:12:09.010]  And it'll absolutely change your life as well.
[03:12:09.010 --> 03:12:09.651]  I appreciate your call.
[03:12:10.271 --> 03:12:15.672]  And by the way, it's 33% off, it's our new special, and we also have the Prostacard back in.
[03:12:15.672 --> 03:12:26.355]  But yes, I want to do a big push with the Oxy-Powder as well, and with the liver cleanse product that we have, because it's spectacular what happens for most people.
[03:12:26.355 --> 03:12:28.535]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[03:12:28.535 --> 03:12:31.916]  But the government says you don't even need your gallbladder!
[03:12:31.916 --> 03:12:35.757]  God made a mistake when we got the gallbladder.
[03:12:35.757 --> 03:12:37.278]  That's right, you don't even need it.
[03:12:37.278 --> 03:12:38.538]  So why do you want to clean it out?
[03:12:39.508 --> 03:12:39.948]  That's right.
[03:12:39.948 --> 03:12:41.608]  Cigarettes are good for you.
[03:12:41.608 --> 03:12:44.569]  Okay, let's go to the next caller here.
[03:12:44.569 --> 03:12:46.430]  I really appreciate you holding.
[03:12:46.430 --> 03:12:49.170]  Who is up next here?
[03:12:49.170 --> 03:12:52.931]  That would be Steve in Nevada.
[03:12:52.931 --> 03:12:53.691]  Steve, you're on the air.
[03:12:53.691 --> 03:12:55.772]  Go ahead.
[03:12:55.772 --> 03:12:56.192]  Hey, Alex.
[03:12:56.192 --> 03:12:58.332]  It's a pleasure to talk to you.
[03:12:58.332 --> 03:12:58.792]  Welcome, sir.
[03:12:58.792 --> 03:13:01.933]  And I'm just going to make this short and sweet.
[03:13:03.106 --> 03:13:07.629]  Recently you had, I guess, a court case involving Sandy Hook.
[03:13:07.629 --> 03:13:08.949]  Well, these are the facts.
[03:13:08.949 --> 03:13:14.633]  That judge knew that the FBI website had listed nobody died at Sandy Hook.
[03:13:14.633 --> 03:13:20.036]  That judge has seen the pictures of all those supposedly killed kids in other states.
[03:13:20.036 --> 03:13:26.560]  That judge knows nothing happened at Sandy Hook, and he convicted you anyways, and that judge needs to be disbarred.
[03:13:26.560 --> 03:13:28.981]  Well, let me just say three things, sir.
[03:13:28.981 --> 03:13:30.943]  A. You don't...
[03:13:32.455 --> 03:13:34.137]  I don't know what judge you're talking about specifically.
[03:13:34.137 --> 03:13:37.040]  You don't disbar a judge.
[03:13:37.040 --> 03:13:41.865]  And I've not been convicted of Sandy Hook.
[03:13:41.865 --> 03:13:48.132]  They've had news articles that they run everywhere saying Alex Jones found guilty of writing a book.
[03:13:48.132 --> 03:13:49.213]  Nobody doubted Sandy Hook.
[03:13:49.213 --> 03:13:51.055]  I didn't write that book.
[03:13:51.055 --> 03:13:52.776]  I did not lose a lawsuit.
[03:13:52.776 --> 03:13:53.657]  None of that's true.
[03:13:57.412 --> 03:13:58.973]  I believe mass shootings happen.
[03:13:58.973 --> 03:14:00.434]  I believe people have a right to question them.
[03:14:00.434 --> 03:14:02.076]  The internet questioned Sandy Hook.
[03:14:02.076 --> 03:14:05.098]  I legitimately questioned it.
[03:14:05.098 --> 03:14:09.901]  They try to make me the Sandy Hook guy, and try to say my whole show's about Sandy Hook.
[03:14:09.901 --> 03:14:13.444]  So, that's why I can't stand, you know, talking about her, getting into it.
[03:14:13.444 --> 03:14:17.027]  It's like, it's like, uh, Tonto Peranto.
[03:14:17.027 --> 03:14:20.850]  Chris Tonto Peranto said, he hears about Benghazi, he wants to go crazy.
[03:14:20.850 --> 03:14:22.271]  Just because it's all he ever hears from everybody.
[03:14:23.334 --> 03:14:24.818]  Over and over and over and over and over again.
[03:14:24.818 --> 03:14:29.608]  It's like I was talking to this one service veteran who had a couple of his toes blown off.
[03:14:30.769 --> 03:14:36.752]  And it happened like 10 years ago, and every time he's at the beach, or every time he's anywhere, or the gym, people ask about his toes missing.
[03:14:36.752 --> 03:14:43.835]  And it's not that he feels bad his toes are missing, or he's ashamed of it, he's sick of hearing about the same thing over and over again.
[03:14:43.835 --> 03:14:46.056]  So they make me the Sandy Hook guy.
[03:14:46.056 --> 03:14:54.680]  They use the fame of Infowars to attach it to Sandy Hook, to then try to get donations, over 100 million of it, into these foundations and groups that are there.
[03:14:54.680 --> 03:14:57.121]  We got a big investigation coming out on that very soon.
[03:14:57.121 --> 03:15:00.143]  Who the people are, how much money they've gotten, it's really horrible stuff.
[03:15:01.232 --> 03:15:01.752]  That's why.
[03:15:01.752 --> 03:15:14.723]  They know my name's really big, so they attach me to it, and then say, Alex is talking about us, he's being mean, he's doing bad things, and then money is gained and raised off my name, while they tell me that I'm talking about Sandy Hook.
[03:15:14.723 --> 03:15:15.584]  I appreciate your call.
[03:15:15.584 --> 03:15:18.626]  I just, I don't ban topics here on air.
[03:15:18.626 --> 03:15:21.669]  I saw you wanted to talk about it, but I'm gonna tell you I don't like talking about it.
[03:15:21.669 --> 03:15:26.273]  And it's not because it's a big secret thing, and oh my God, it's so powerful, and all this stuff.
[03:15:28.283 --> 03:15:34.808]  ABC News just got caught cropping video and saying that Trump allowed a city to be blown up with giant mushroom clouds.
[03:15:34.808 --> 03:15:37.950]  It was cans of gas being blown up on the ground.
[03:15:37.950 --> 03:15:39.551]  It was 10 foot tall stuff.
[03:15:39.551 --> 03:15:40.532]  Everybody knows that.
[03:15:40.532 --> 03:15:42.073]  You can't believe a damn word they say.
[03:15:42.073 --> 03:15:44.996]  So it's okay to question anything you want.
[03:15:44.996 --> 03:15:47.137]  But my identity is not Sandy Hook.
[03:15:47.137 --> 03:15:48.218]  It is not Sandy Hook.
[03:15:48.218 --> 03:15:49.319]  I am not the Sandy Hook man.
[03:15:51.667 --> 03:15:52.888]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla.
[03:15:52.888 --> 03:15:56.811]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[03:15:56.811 --> 03:15:58.352]  I sued the IRS and won.
[03:15:58.352 --> 03:16:01.314]  I beat the IRS then, and I've been beating them ever since.
[03:16:01.314 --> 03:16:06.877]  I wrote the book on tax debt settlement, and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:16:06.877 --> 03:16:08.078]  I can help you, too.
[03:16:08.078 --> 03:16:11.000]  If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day.
[03:16:11.000 --> 03:16:13.242]  There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.
[03:16:13.242 --> 03:16:17.685]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX or go to my website, danpilla.com.
[03:16:17.685 --> 03:16:19.966]  That's danpilla.com, danpilla.com.
[03:16:21.207 --> 03:16:27.551]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of the world.
[03:16:27.551 --> 03:16:30.592]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[03:16:30.592 --> 03:16:36.516]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[03:16:36.516 --> 03:16:40.298]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[03:16:40.298 --> 03:16:41.579]  Was there ever a vote?
[03:16:41.579 --> 03:16:42.919]  Who do we fight for?
[03:16:42.919 --> 03:16:49.123]  The Deep State began with World War I. The United States of Empire by James Dunn.
[03:16:49.123 --> 03:16:50.544]  Available at Amazon Books.
[03:16:51.530 --> 03:16:54.531]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?

[03:17:57.005 --> 03:17:59.048]  Infowarslife.com.
[03:17:59.048 --> 03:18:08.318]  You go to that URL, it takes you to the subsection of Infowarsstore.com where you find the 60 plus products where we've gone out and researched what is the best,
[03:18:08.939 --> 03:18:10.680]  Well, it gives people the best results.
[03:18:10.680 --> 03:18:14.423]  We either private label it or we develop our own with top developers.
[03:18:14.423 --> 03:18:19.287]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus.
[03:18:19.287 --> 03:18:22.190]  I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months.
[03:18:22.190 --> 03:18:23.110]  It's incredible.
[03:18:23.110 --> 03:18:24.772]  So do yourself a favor.
[03:18:24.772 --> 03:18:27.254]  Try out the products if you've been on the fence.
[03:18:27.254 --> 03:18:30.136]  You can't lose, except if you don't take action.
[03:18:30.136 --> 03:18:37.102]  Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering, thanks to your support and God's grace and our action.
[03:18:37.662 --> 03:18:38.963]  But you need these products.
[03:18:38.963 --> 03:18:42.025]  That's the real reason you want to get them, is because they're amazing.
[03:18:42.025 --> 03:18:45.947]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[03:18:45.947 --> 03:18:49.790]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding.
[03:18:49.790 --> 03:18:51.691]  We're fighting to win, and we are winning.
[03:18:51.691 --> 03:18:52.492]  Thanks to you.
[03:18:52.492 --> 03:18:55.614]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers of InfoWars.
[03:18:56.621 --> 03:19:07.010]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana as a challenge to the globalist system of corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S., but worldwide.
[03:19:07.010 --> 03:19:13.837]  And President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is amazing as well.
[03:19:14.537 --> 03:19:19.561]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that and some other areas.
[03:19:19.561 --> 03:19:24.304]  But trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China.
[03:19:24.304 --> 03:19:26.986]  Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever.
[03:19:27.844 --> 03:19:33.008]  We really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[03:19:33.008 --> 03:19:37.972]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[03:19:37.972 --> 03:19:40.334]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them.
[03:19:40.334 --> 03:19:46.118]  But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[03:19:46.118 --> 03:19:48.119]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[03:19:48.119 --> 03:19:51.202]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[03:19:55.473 --> 03:19:58.121]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:40.953 --> 03:20:43.154]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide.
[03:20:43.154 --> 03:20:46.135]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[03:20:46.135 --> 03:20:47.595]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[03:20:47.595 --> 03:20:49.756]  We may connect with Owen a little bit later.
[03:20:49.756 --> 03:20:53.097]  He's there at the site where the Democrats are about to have their debate tonight.
[03:20:53.097 --> 03:20:55.218]  But right now, let's go to Eli in Texas.
[03:20:55.218 --> 03:20:56.418]  Eli, you're on the air worldwide.
[03:20:56.418 --> 03:20:57.699]  Go ahead.
[03:20:57.699 --> 03:20:58.419]  Hey, Alex.
[03:20:58.419 --> 03:20:59.980]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:20:59.980 --> 03:21:02.841]  It's awesome to get to finally talk to you.
[03:21:02.841 --> 03:21:06.582]  I've got a few things, and I just wanted to start with a plug for Knockout.
[03:21:07.948 --> 03:21:10.310]  I'm a full-time college student.
[03:21:10.310 --> 03:21:23.322]  I was having a lot of trouble sleeping this past semester with insomnia and it caused my grades to suffer and I finally decided to start taking Knockout and man, it's changed my life.
[03:21:23.322 --> 03:21:30.709]  I mean, I wake up with so much more energy and I'm getting my full eight hours of sleep and so for that, I really appreciate you.
[03:21:32.262 --> 03:21:49.247]  I kind of wanted to talk about the liberalization of Austin that has happened over the past few decades as a fellow Texan, because I know it used to be a little more libertarian, and I guess more classically liberal, and so I just wanted to get your take on that.
[03:21:49.247 --> 03:21:52.448]  Thank you very much, and God bless you.
[03:21:52.448 --> 03:21:53.628]  Well, God bless you, brother.
[03:21:53.628 --> 03:21:55.129]  Anything else you'd like to add?
[03:21:56.831 --> 03:22:03.755]  Uh, that's pretty much it, and then maybe if I could get your take on what's going on with Julian Assange currently?
[03:22:03.755 --> 03:22:18.885]  Well, they're persecuting him, and he's a hero, and the President told him to release the information he did back when he was a candidate, and it's a real black mark on the President, and it really, really worries me about President Trump, that he's leaving Julian Assange out there to dry.
[03:22:19.793 --> 03:22:22.995]  And twist of the wind, and that he better help Roger Stone.
[03:22:22.995 --> 03:22:25.637]  The sentencing's coming up on February 7th.
[03:22:25.637 --> 03:22:35.003]  Roger Stone did nothing wrong, and I support President Trump, but I gotta tell you, when you don't stand up for people, it's a scary thing.
[03:22:37.469 --> 03:22:40.432]  I mean, Nancy Pelosi's calling Mitch McConnell a Russian agent now.
[03:22:40.432 --> 03:22:41.233]  Are we going to put up with that?
[03:22:41.233 --> 03:22:43.696]  I mean, this is a witch hunt.
[03:22:43.696 --> 03:22:44.717]  People have been persecuted.
[03:22:44.717 --> 03:22:46.679]  They're trying to put me in jail.
[03:22:46.679 --> 03:22:49.803]  They're trying to plant child porn on us, and I'm tired of it.
[03:22:49.803 --> 03:22:51.405]  I'm not backing down from this.
[03:22:51.405 --> 03:22:53.087]  I want action against these people, Eli.
[03:22:56.395 --> 03:22:57.216]  I agree.
[03:22:57.216 --> 03:22:57.837]  I agree with you.
[03:22:57.837 --> 03:22:58.557]  God bless you.
[03:22:58.557 --> 03:22:59.398]  God bless you, sir.
[03:22:59.398 --> 03:22:59.638]  All right.
[03:22:59.638 --> 03:23:01.840]  We've got Owen Schroer on the line here.
[03:23:01.840 --> 03:23:03.221]  I just wanted him to pop in.
[03:23:03.221 --> 03:23:11.089]  I notice he's there where the Democrats are going to have their DNC event tonight, their final so-called debate before the primaries begin.
[03:23:11.089 --> 03:23:14.271]  Hard to believe we're already here with 293 days out.
[03:23:14.271 --> 03:23:16.473]  And it looks like a coffin out there, Owen.
[03:23:16.473 --> 03:23:18.515]  Nobody's there.
[03:23:18.515 --> 03:23:21.338]  Boy, I tell you, it looks like a ghost town there at Drake University.
[03:23:22.762 --> 03:23:31.976]  Well it's amazing Alex because you have a Trump rally tonight as well in Milwaukee, Wisconsin where you already have thousands of people lined up outside the venue.
[03:23:34.236 --> 03:23:41.738]  In fact, the only real political thing we've seen is a Trump supporter out here.
[03:23:41.738 --> 03:23:51.522]  There's an airplane in the sky with a big Trump sign on it, and I was told when I got my rent-a-car that there were some other Trump supporters that came through the airport to get a rent-a-car too.
[03:23:51.522 --> 03:23:54.983]  So, the only thing I'm even hearing now is about Trump supporters being here.
[03:23:55.788 --> 03:23:59.751]  We see all the polls, Alex, and this is why it's important for us to document this.
[03:23:59.751 --> 03:24:02.894]  We see the polls saying, oh, Sanders is beating Trump.
[03:24:02.894 --> 03:24:04.475]  Oh, Biden is beating Trump.
[03:24:04.475 --> 03:24:06.137]  Oh, Warren is beating Trump.
[03:24:06.137 --> 03:24:08.018]  Well, there's no actual evidence for that.
[03:24:08.018 --> 03:24:09.380]  There's no physical evidence for that.
[03:24:09.380 --> 03:24:10.981]  There's no empirical evidence for that.
[03:24:10.981 --> 03:24:13.443]  There's just fake polls and hearsay.
[03:24:13.443 --> 03:24:21.410]  But I think the fact that you have all the big candidates here in Iowa, which people know is a big political ground at this time of year before a presidential election,
[03:24:22.130 --> 03:24:23.811]  And there's almost nobody here.
[03:24:23.811 --> 03:24:26.011]  There's nobody lined up to see their candidates.
[03:24:26.011 --> 03:24:29.413]  I think I may have seen one Pete Buttigieg sign.
[03:24:29.413 --> 03:24:37.256]  Other than that, it's just either media people covering it or just students that are just here happen to be passing by, even though it's winter break.
[03:24:37.256 --> 03:24:38.316]  So the whole narrative.
[03:24:38.769 --> 03:24:45.154]  That any of the Democrat candidates can defeat Trump or are polling ahead of Trump is so provably false.
[03:24:45.154 --> 03:24:59.667]  It's really, it just shows you how committed they are to the lie that they would even continue to run these fake polls when Trump has 5,000 people outside of an event hours before it starts and here you have all the big Democrat candidates here and it's pretty much a ghost town.
[03:25:01.789 --> 03:25:04.871]  Perhaps you guys can get some footage.
[03:25:04.871 --> 03:25:15.618]  I know you're going to be posting some reports up close to the building there, but I mean, this is crazy in a major college on a Tuesday afternoon, and it looks like a ghost town.
[03:25:15.618 --> 03:25:17.420]  Nobody there for that.
[03:25:17.420 --> 03:25:20.822]  You can believe that if Trump's going to a debate, there'd be 50,000 people
[03:25:22.563 --> 03:25:25.745]  Outside of that, just showing how much our energy is different.
[03:25:25.745 --> 03:25:28.367]  When we go to break, we're going to come back and go to Russell.
[03:25:28.367 --> 03:25:29.428]  He wants to talk about the camps.
[03:25:29.428 --> 03:25:31.109]  I don't know if you've seen this on the road.
[03:25:31.109 --> 03:25:46.261]  Project Veritas has released video of Bernie Sanders campaign operatives, word for word, talking about the plan to put people in concentration camps of their white males, attack the police, overthrow the government, burn down U.S.
[03:25:46.261 --> 03:25:50.644]  cities for martial law, executing an operation of Alexander Soros.
[03:25:51.840 --> 03:25:53.681]  Yeah, actually, I was able to review that.
[03:25:53.681 --> 03:25:58.105]  I filed a report on it earlier, and we will be bringing that up today out here.
[03:25:58.105 --> 03:26:00.686]  I wonder if it's going to be brought up inside the debate.
[03:26:00.686 --> 03:26:05.550]  I doubt the media will touch it, but maybe Elizabeth Warren wants to go there, but we'll see.
[03:26:05.550 --> 03:26:06.250]  Only time will tell.
[03:26:06.250 --> 03:26:11.294]  But I'm glad you brought up the fact that if Trump came here, there'd be a lot more foot traffic.
[03:26:11.294 --> 03:26:13.195]  Well, Trump is, in fact, coming here.
[03:26:13.195 --> 03:26:16.318]  In fact, he's booked the major arena here.
[03:26:16.917 --> 03:26:22.984]  While the Democrats are in a little town hall facility, Trump booked the major arena that can hold 10,000 plus.
[03:26:22.984 --> 03:26:27.609]  So you know there's going to be 10,000 plus here when Trump comes here in give or take a month.
[03:26:27.609 --> 03:26:28.970]  Was it about a month?
[03:26:28.970 --> 03:26:31.593]  And for this debate, I mean, we're going to walk around, Alex.
[03:26:31.593 --> 03:26:32.494]  We're scoping the scene.
[03:26:32.494 --> 03:26:34.095]  We're kind of doing some recon right now.
[03:26:34.095 --> 03:26:39.161]  But that's why we just decided to kind of stay here because we got this nice sign in the background.
[03:26:39.762 --> 03:26:41.846]  And we figured, hey, you know, we'll stay here.
[03:26:41.846 --> 03:26:45.052]  We're about three blocks away from the venue.
[03:26:45.052 --> 03:26:46.555]  But yeah, there's no energy.
[03:26:46.555 --> 03:26:51.103]  As far as political energy for any of the candidates out here, it's pretty much nothing.
[03:26:52.088 --> 03:26:54.851]  All right, Owen, we really appreciate you and the crew there.
[03:26:54.851 --> 03:26:59.157]  I want you to get back to work, and I'm going to host the next two segments and finish up with the calls.
[03:26:59.157 --> 03:27:03.943]  I'm going to play part of a Savannah Hernandez report as well coming up at the end.
[03:27:03.943 --> 03:27:11.472]  And of course, I guess you're going to be streaming some live during your show today, or is Savannah hosting the War Room coming up here in about 30 minutes?
[03:27:12.569 --> 03:27:13.910]  Savannah will be in studio.
[03:27:13.910 --> 03:27:15.750]  I'll be on the ground hosting as well.
[03:27:15.750 --> 03:27:23.134]  So we'll be going back and forth on the scene, in the studio, filing reports, hopefully talking to some people if anybody shows up for this deal.
[03:27:23.134 --> 03:27:23.654]  All right.
[03:27:23.654 --> 03:27:26.115]  Well, we need to show what a ghost town it is.
[03:27:26.115 --> 03:27:28.656]  I mean, I said months ago, this is like death.
[03:27:29.636 --> 03:27:30.316]  That exact quote.
[03:27:30.316 --> 03:27:31.477]  Well, Trump tweeted that out.
[03:27:31.477 --> 03:27:33.358]  It's not like Trump's probably even listening to me.
[03:27:33.358 --> 03:27:35.659]  It's just that we have kind of the same eye on things.
[03:27:35.659 --> 03:27:37.580]  And it's like watching death.
[03:27:37.580 --> 03:27:38.501]  Well, that's what they're pushing.
[03:27:38.501 --> 03:27:41.082]  They're the party of death, the party of evil.
[03:27:41.082 --> 03:27:44.224]  And, you know, it's time for the Republican Party to split in two or something.
[03:27:44.224 --> 03:27:46.645]  The Democratic Party needs to be retired.
[03:27:46.645 --> 03:27:47.665]  It started the KKK.
[03:27:49.307 --> 03:27:52.450]  It runs around trying to create racial division everywhere.
[03:27:52.450 --> 03:27:54.912]  It's just a pack of degenerate filth.
[03:27:54.912 --> 03:28:05.784]  And I think Nancy Pelosi, looking more like a skeleton than ever, is emblematic, is an icon of the spirit of these folks that just need to go ahead and climb into their graves.
[03:28:07.014 --> 03:28:15.760]  And you kind of have the AOCs of the Democrat Party waiting to grab the Templar from the rotting husk that is Nancy Pelosi, but she's still saying no!
[03:28:15.760 --> 03:28:30.210]  Yeah, you've got like mind-numbed, probably the first mentally retarded member of Congress, meth-head AOC, literally like a little demonic gremlin as the big fat Satan's rotting and falling into, but she's trying to grab the scepter, she can't even pick it up or hold it up.
[03:28:30.210 --> 03:28:32.011]  I mean, it is unbelievable.
[03:28:32.011 --> 03:28:34.473]  Owen Schroer, we'll have live feeds at InfoWars.com.
[03:28:35.213 --> 03:28:38.176]  Alex, Russell, Mike, Levi, Michael, I will talk to every single one of you on the other side!
[03:28:51.850 --> 03:28:53.811]  Heart disease is on the rise.
[03:28:53.811 --> 03:28:59.135]  Clogged arteries, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you.
[03:28:59.135 --> 03:29:00.716]  But the symptoms are there.
[03:29:00.716 --> 03:29:09.082]  Loss of energy, blood sugar spikes and drops, poor circulation, and irregular heartbeat are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong.
[03:29:09.082 --> 03:29:14.766]  Hear how heart and body extract is making a difference in thousands of people's lives across America.
[03:29:14.926 --> 03:29:16.748]  My blood pressure has normalized.
[03:29:16.748 --> 03:29:19.051]  My diabetes has totally improved.
[03:29:19.051 --> 03:29:23.436]  Everyone is telling me now how much healthier I look and I'm telling everyone how much healthier I feel.
[03:29:23.436 --> 03:29:25.618]  I recommend Heart and Body Extract to everyone.
[03:29:25.618 --> 03:29:33.487]  Anybody over 40 in the North American continent should be using this product as a preventative to keep their cardiovascular system healthy.

[03:29:56.707 --> 03:29:58.628]  You don't want my thanks.
[03:29:58.628 --> 03:30:04.594]  You want victory over the globalists and these devil worship and child molesters, and you want them off your back and off your children's back.
[03:30:04.594 --> 03:30:05.735]  And you know what?
[03:30:05.735 --> 03:30:09.058]  I'm the same way, and that's why we're on the same damn team.
[03:30:09.058 --> 03:30:13.361]  And it's why Infowars has been delivering time and time again, when it's clutch time.
[03:30:15.666 --> 03:30:23.752]  Focus the people on taking action against the globalists, because I'm committed to a future for humanity, and I know you are as well.
[03:30:23.752 --> 03:30:31.857]  So thank you in 2019 for standing with us, because you are the Infowar, and I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[03:30:31.857 --> 03:30:40.544]  From the bottom of my heart, from my family, and from the great crew at Infowars, I want to thank you all because you are the Infowar, and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[03:30:41.590 --> 03:30:43.214]  You have made history.
[03:30:43.214 --> 03:30:44.436]  We have made history together.
[03:30:44.436 --> 03:30:49.687]  Infowars.com only has power because of you.
[03:30:49.687 --> 03:30:51.491]  And I suggest you use it.
[03:30:52.386 --> 03:30:58.753]  With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin, it's only natural that it starts to crack and take damage.
[03:30:58.753 --> 03:31:05.621]  Wind, heat, water, and age are telltale signs that it's time to start taking care of your skin.

[03:31:35.787 --> 03:31:38.429]  With none of the harmful ingredients found in other formulas,
[03:31:38.789 --> 03:31:39.389]  Hey, you there.
[03:31:39.389 --> 03:31:40.029]  We have a problem.
[03:31:40.029 --> 03:31:41.850]  You see, there is a baby.
[03:31:41.850 --> 03:31:45.451]  The mother of this baby is not sure she's ready.
[03:31:45.451 --> 03:31:48.472]  The father of this baby doesn't want to settle down.
[03:32:07.128 --> 03:32:09.929]  The mother starts to have regrets.
[03:32:09.929 --> 03:32:13.689]  The father considers leaving town.
[03:32:13.689 --> 03:32:17.030]  But a friend says there's a solution.
[03:32:17.030 --> 03:32:21.171]  She says to have an abortion.
[03:32:21.171 --> 03:32:23.071]  The mother decides to look into it.
[03:32:23.071 --> 03:32:26.152]  The clinic assures her it's safe.
[03:32:26.152 --> 03:32:27.932]  She's made her decision.
[03:32:27.932 --> 03:32:30.432]  She's going to have an abortion.
[03:32:30.432 --> 03:32:33.653]  The problem is that baby is you.
[03:32:36.690 --> 03:32:45.734]  Join me, Owen Schroyer, at the March for Life, Friday, January 24th, in Washington, D.C., noon, at the National Mall.
[03:32:45.734 --> 03:32:46.874]  I'll see you there.
[03:32:46.874 --> 03:32:49.315]  It's time to stand up for the unborn.
[03:32:49.315 --> 03:32:55.438]  It's time to speak out for the voiceless.
[03:32:55.438 --> 03:32:58.079]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:04.735 --> 03:33:05.296]  The Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:05.296 --> 03:33:06.958]  Because there is a war on, on your mind.
[03:33:06.958 --> 03:33:12.144]  If you like to gamble, I'll tell you how to play.
[03:33:12.144 --> 03:33:23.057]  You win some, you lose some, but you're the same to me.
[03:33:31.852 --> 03:33:32.635]  The pleasure is to play!
[03:33:32.635 --> 03:33:34.101]  We are Backline, broadcasting worldwide.
[03:33:34.101 --> 03:33:35.266]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[03:33:36.334 --> 03:33:39.695]  Russell in North Carolina wants to talk about the camps.
[03:33:39.695 --> 03:33:41.895]  The Democrats just rubbing their hands together.
[03:33:41.895 --> 03:33:43.435]  We've got a big compilation.
[03:33:43.435 --> 03:33:44.356]  The new videos come out.
[03:33:44.356 --> 03:33:46.116]  Project Veritas just joined us.
[03:33:46.116 --> 03:33:51.297]  And they're just like, oh, we can't wait to burn all the cities down and put the white males in camps.
[03:33:51.297 --> 03:33:52.277]  Are they smart?
[03:33:52.277 --> 03:33:54.497]  Oh, God, we're going to crush them.
[03:33:54.497 --> 03:33:57.878]  Just wish we got them in the camps.
[03:33:57.878 --> 03:34:00.099]  But then you're like, oh, that's just, you know, some nut.
[03:34:00.099 --> 03:34:02.119]  No, that's a major Bernie Sanders operative.
[03:34:03.407 --> 03:34:11.490]  But we have all the stacks of articles and documents and videos of Democrat officials saying it's their plan, their dream.
[03:34:11.490 --> 03:34:12.491]  Well, guess what?
[03:34:12.491 --> 03:34:16.272]  You ain't gonna get your dream, globalist.
[03:34:16.272 --> 03:34:18.753]  You slime buckets.
[03:34:18.753 --> 03:34:19.454]  Russell, go ahead.
[03:34:19.454 --> 03:34:22.015]  Thanks for holding.
[03:34:22.015 --> 03:34:22.775]  No problem, man.
[03:34:22.775 --> 03:34:24.296]  That is not gonna happen.
[03:34:24.296 --> 03:34:29.778]  Not if we have anything to do about it, but... Can you imagine if the commies actually start their fight, though?
[03:34:29.778 --> 03:34:30.658]  What's gonna happen to them?
[03:34:32.788 --> 03:34:40.251]  I saw a meme, I think it was a meme, I don't know where it was from, but it was something like, they talked about the amount of guns the U.S.
[03:34:40.251 --> 03:34:47.754]  Army has, and different armies around the world, and then they compared it all to just the southern United States.
[03:34:47.754 --> 03:34:49.114]  The amount of guns that are here.
[03:34:49.114 --> 03:34:53.156]  The people that are here that would rather die than give up.
[03:34:53.156 --> 03:34:58.298]  You know what makes fighting Islam so dangerous?
[03:34:58.298 --> 03:35:00.358]  Islam extremists.
[03:35:00.358 --> 03:35:02.059]  They would rather die than give up.
[03:35:02.779 --> 03:35:05.600]  That's what makes them crazy, radical.
[03:35:05.600 --> 03:35:09.101]  It's what makes them so effective is they would rather die.
[03:35:09.101 --> 03:35:11.062]  Well, I would rather die.
[03:35:11.062 --> 03:35:15.083]  So that's what, if the commies start their fight, that's what they're going to be facing.
[03:35:15.083 --> 03:35:21.505]  Yeah, they think we're dumb and like we're just going to go randomly kill cops or something because they're going to send the cops after everybody and they can control the departments.
[03:35:21.505 --> 03:35:23.886]  We're just going to go right around the cops to them.
[03:35:23.886 --> 03:35:27.247]  These professors and these globalists and all these little chicken necks that want to fight.
[03:35:27.247 --> 03:35:28.588]  They start it, they're going to get one.
[03:35:29.929 --> 03:35:32.911]  That's waiting for them to cross that line.
[03:35:32.911 --> 03:35:34.653]  Waiting for them to cross that line.
[03:35:34.653 --> 03:35:36.994]  I don't think they're going to have to re-educate.
[03:35:36.994 --> 03:35:40.417]  I think, hypothetically, if their plan
[03:35:42.057 --> 03:35:43.038]  Was to move forward.
[03:35:43.038 --> 03:35:46.080]  They would kill most of us because they know who we are.
[03:35:46.080 --> 03:35:47.080]  They know where we fall.
[03:35:47.080 --> 03:35:49.562]  That's what Zbigniew Brzezinski... Guys, try to pull it up.
[03:35:49.562 --> 03:35:53.945]  Zbigniew Brzezinski says it's easier to kill a million people than to politically control them.
[03:35:53.945 --> 03:35:55.606]  He said that at the CFR.
[03:35:55.606 --> 03:35:57.707]  He said we can no longer control them.
[03:35:57.707 --> 03:35:59.928]  It is better to just kill all of the Americans.
[03:35:59.928 --> 03:36:02.590]  I'll tell you something else.
[03:36:02.590 --> 03:36:07.813]  There are roughly 200 underground military bases in America.
[03:36:07.813 --> 03:36:09.234]  I don't know how many there are worldwide.
[03:36:10.525 --> 03:36:15.066]  These bases are going to house the submissive, the quote, best of humanity.
[03:36:15.066 --> 03:36:16.066]  That's where they're going to go.
[03:36:16.066 --> 03:36:20.707]  And that will give us easy places to drop bunker busters.
[03:36:20.707 --> 03:36:22.208]  Exactly, if it gets to that.
[03:36:22.208 --> 03:36:29.249]  But here's the thing, those bunkers... They will serve as tombs for the globalists.
[03:36:29.249 --> 03:36:31.370]  Yeah, they can't house everybody.
[03:36:32.048 --> 03:36:34.349]  So before they even get to that, they're going to have to kill people.
[03:36:34.349 --> 03:36:36.089]  That's how it's all connected.
[03:36:36.089 --> 03:36:42.271]  Well, they all call themselves pharaohs and everything, so they'll be at the bottom of a tomb under a mountain.
[03:36:42.271 --> 03:36:43.271]  Hall the Mountain King.
[03:36:43.271 --> 03:36:46.252]  A pyramid of mountain, yeah.
[03:36:46.252 --> 03:36:51.393]  Hey, did you see, remember when Swallow's Well, reportedly the submissive
[03:36:53.550 --> 03:36:58.351]  Individual of, of, of, Shifts, Shifts, uh, Shifts Butler.
[03:36:58.351 --> 03:37:04.653]  Remember when Swallowswell, Eric Swallowswell said, we've got nuclear weapons and we'll use them on American gun owners.
[03:37:04.653 --> 03:37:14.015]  The ignorance of that statement that A, you use a city destroying weapon to get the resistance when the cities are full of their people, on average.
[03:37:14.015 --> 03:37:14.555]  Their own people.
[03:37:15.035 --> 03:37:19.558]  And we couldn't beat Vietnam because we shouldn't be there, and they weren't going to give up, just like the Islamists.
[03:37:19.558 --> 03:37:22.661]  We were tricked into that fight by the proto-globalists, they admit that.
[03:37:22.661 --> 03:37:24.742]  But the point is, if people won't give up, you can't beat them.
[03:37:24.742 --> 03:37:27.564]  And so it's not even the right weapons system.
[03:37:27.564 --> 03:37:33.749]  I mean, if you really wanted to get rid of the left, you would hit the blue cities with neutron bombs.
[03:37:34.609 --> 03:37:36.711]  You'd have to kill a lot of our own people, and I don't like that.
[03:37:36.711 --> 03:37:37.571]  I'm not a mass murderer.
[03:37:37.571 --> 03:37:43.775]  But if you want to play his game, we would use neutron bombs on the majors, you know, Los Angeles and other areas.
[03:37:43.775 --> 03:37:55.062]  But I mean, again, just his total arrogance and the ignorance of military affairs and history at a thousand levels to threaten the American people with hydrogen bombs.
[03:37:55.062 --> 03:37:56.542]  That's their mindset.
[03:37:56.542 --> 03:37:58.984]  That shows his mindset, his goal.
[03:37:59.744 --> 03:38:01.925]  Yeah, it's not for humanity.
[03:38:01.925 --> 03:38:02.566]  It's for evil.
[03:38:19.096 --> 03:38:23.079]  So, you know, the left says humans are bad, they all want to die, they want to take us with them.
[03:38:23.079 --> 03:38:29.703]  You say, listen, 100 million of you want to go out to the desert, we'll drop a neutron bomb on top of you, and you can all save the Earth by dying.
[03:38:29.703 --> 03:38:34.547]  Because the neutron bomb doesn't put the irradiation off after the first burst.
[03:38:34.547 --> 03:38:36.028]  They'll never sign up for it.
[03:38:36.028 --> 03:38:40.591]  It's the same as, why don't you open your doors to some illegal aliens for us?
[03:38:40.591 --> 03:38:42.492]  If you're so big on that, open your doors.
[03:38:42.492 --> 03:38:44.213]  If you're so big on this, why don't you die?
[03:38:44.213 --> 03:38:45.914]  Or why don't you sign your family up for this?
[03:38:45.914 --> 03:38:46.635]  They'll never do it.
[03:38:47.855 --> 03:39:07.934]  Before I go, I wanted to say, um, I believe, and you can call me crazy, but I believe that they have a plan B. I believe that... Oh, you know they got a plan B. I think Mars is... I'm crazy.
[03:39:07.934 --> 03:39:09.756]  I think Mars is populated already.
[03:39:09.756 --> 03:39:11.518]  I think the moon might be.
[03:39:12.193 --> 03:39:15.994]  I think that that is their plan B. Well, let's just say this.
[03:39:15.994 --> 03:39:20.876]  There's a lot of crap going on we don't know about, and these globalists act like followers.
[03:39:20.876 --> 03:39:24.697]  They're all taking orders to do really bad stuff, and they know it, and they're scared.
[03:39:24.697 --> 03:39:26.698]  It's why almost none of them have kids.
[03:39:26.698 --> 03:39:28.979]  And yeah, they've been letting on some really bad stuff.
[03:39:28.979 --> 03:39:32.800]  And they're really pissed Trump's in there, because I believe Trump wants a pro-human future.
[03:39:32.800 --> 03:39:34.821]  I appreciate your call.
[03:39:34.821 --> 03:39:36.662]  I'm not the one saying Mars is populated.
[03:39:36.662 --> 03:39:38.542]  That's other shows.
[03:39:38.542 --> 03:39:39.883]  People can say whatever they want.
[03:39:40.646 --> 03:39:46.390]  Because we've been lied to so much, who the hell knows what's going on at this point?
[03:39:46.390 --> 03:39:53.956]  They're now injecting tens of thousands of people with live... I can't even say it, it's so insane.
[03:39:53.956 --> 03:40:02.863]  Ebola, and of course it's been genetically engineered to quote, not be harmful, but it sheds and it mutates.
[03:40:02.863 --> 03:40:04.144]  They don't know what it's gonna do!
[03:40:04.144 --> 03:40:08.207]  These people are crazy.
[03:40:08.207 --> 03:40:09.048]  They're bad scientists.
[03:40:10.179 --> 03:40:10.959]  Hey Alex, good afternoon.
[03:40:10.959 --> 03:40:12.820]  I got the knockout blow for Trump to get his attention.
[03:40:12.820 --> 03:40:14.541]  Combining it with your decals that are put over people's mouths
[03:40:41.610 --> 03:40:44.733]  For the First Amendment at his rallies.
[03:40:44.733 --> 03:40:48.857]  I am calling on my brothers and sisters temporarily.
[03:40:48.857 --> 03:40:59.046]  I get between 6 and 12 emails and text messages from the Trump campaign asking me for money every day and I'm sick of it.
[03:40:59.046 --> 03:41:06.333]  We need to stop sending the Trump campaign money temporarily and emailing them telling them why.
[03:41:07.114 --> 03:41:27.076]  Until Donald Trump starts paying attention to the First Amendment, and fighting the globalists, and fighting Google, and YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, restoring InfoWars' rights, and the rights of the people to freely express their opinions, he won't get another dime.
[03:41:27.870 --> 03:41:33.634]  That one-two punch, what's he going to say when he sees all those decals over people's mouths at his rally?
[03:41:33.634 --> 03:41:36.296]  By the way, those stickers will be in by the middle of next week.
[03:41:36.296 --> 03:41:38.758]  I wish they were in now to take with us to D.C.
[03:41:38.758 --> 03:41:40.879]  We ordered massive amounts.
[03:41:40.879 --> 03:41:42.921]  It's just gargantuan amounts of them.
[03:41:42.921 --> 03:41:46.563]  They're not in yet, but they're this size for a TV viewer.
[03:41:46.563 --> 03:41:49.385]  They're big, and they're not that big.
[03:41:49.385 --> 03:41:50.847]  Once they're back, they're a little bit smaller.
[03:41:53.200 --> 03:42:00.322]  It's gonna be awesome, and they'll go over your mouth, or you can wear them on your shirt, and they look just like tape, but they're not.
[03:42:00.322 --> 03:42:04.923]  They look just like, you know, gray tape.
[03:42:04.923 --> 03:42:05.644]  Industrial tape.
[03:42:05.644 --> 03:42:07.024]  I'm having one of those moments.
[03:42:07.024 --> 03:42:09.125]  What do you call that kind of tape?
[03:42:09.125 --> 03:42:09.665]  Duct tape.
[03:42:09.665 --> 03:42:10.785]  Duct tape.
[03:42:10.785 --> 03:42:12.626]  And save the first, save the second.
[03:42:12.626 --> 03:42:13.706]  Operation Win 2020.
[03:42:13.706 --> 03:42:15.907]  That's what the whole thing's called, Operation 2020.
[03:42:15.907 --> 03:42:16.647]  We've got a website.
[03:42:16.647 --> 03:42:17.207]  It's all built.
[03:42:17.207 --> 03:42:20.388]  I've just got to shoot a video about it, and I've got to write the message.
[03:42:21.994 --> 03:42:24.576]  So I'm going to shoot actually a promo on this today.
[03:42:24.576 --> 03:42:26.078]  Today is the day.
[03:42:26.078 --> 03:42:28.420]  And enough people go to Trump rallies.
[03:42:28.420 --> 03:42:30.121]  Hell, half of them are our listeners.
[03:42:30.121 --> 03:42:33.064]  With these stickers, we're going to sell at cost.
[03:42:33.064 --> 03:42:34.605]  And they'll go in all the orders.
[03:42:34.605 --> 03:42:36.747]  That will really have a message that takes over the event.
[03:42:36.747 --> 03:42:37.888]  And I hear you, brother.
[03:42:37.888 --> 03:42:43.693]  I am really pissed at Trump letting them piss all over the First Amendment and engage in all this massive censorship and surveillance.
[03:42:43.693 --> 03:42:45.615]  I mean, he needs to take action now.
[03:42:45.615 --> 03:42:46.816]  He needs to do something.
[03:42:51.718 --> 03:42:56.321]  The globalists know that I will never willingly give up.
[03:42:56.321 --> 03:42:58.282]  I've said it many times, I will never give in.
[03:42:58.282 --> 03:43:02.885]  I will never give up, but I could give out.
[03:43:02.885 --> 03:43:16.855]  And it's very, very frustrating to see them committing all their crimes against humanity, to see evil running rampant like this, and to know that most Americans have already been silenced in cyberspace.
[03:43:16.855 --> 03:43:20.057]  That most Americans have already been shadow banned by big tech.
[03:43:21.001 --> 03:43:33.029]  And to know that most Americans feel powerless and don't realize how much power they have by spreading the word about NewsWars.com, InfoWars.com, and Ban.Video.
[03:43:33.029 --> 03:43:35.811]  And that people are hungry for the truth now more than ever.
[03:43:35.811 --> 03:43:43.776]  And that if you tell people, hey, the banned truth they don't want you to have is at InfoWars.com forward slash show and Ban.Video.
[03:43:43.776 --> 03:43:45.217]  So take heart folks.
[03:43:45.217 --> 03:43:50.861]  They've had to censor everybody and shut everybody down because the truth is powerful and they can't beat us fair and square.
[03:43:51.261 --> 03:43:54.864]  InfoWars Life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[03:43:54.864 --> 03:43:56.646]  Introducing Pollen Block.
[03:43:56.646 --> 03:44:07.914]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms, including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[03:44:08.675 --> 03:44:17.857]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:44:17.857 --> 03:44:28.400]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:44:28.920 --> 03:44:31.201]  Knock on wood, I am not tempting fate.
[03:44:31.201 --> 03:44:32.622]  But everybody around the office
[03:44:58.683 --> 03:45:04.388]  Especially folks that have worked here a long time, have noticed that I really don't ever get sick.
[03:45:04.388 --> 03:45:08.011]  Now, again, I might get sick tomorrow, because I just made that statement.
[03:45:08.011 --> 03:45:09.292]  I'm not tempting fate.
[03:45:09.292 --> 03:45:12.395]  I'll say that again, because I am superstitious when it comes down to that.
[03:45:12.395 --> 03:45:17.019]  I'm very thankful to the good Lord for the Constitution I've been given.
[03:45:17.019 --> 03:45:25.926]  But, up until about eight, nine years ago, when I started taking X2 and the products to enforce life, I still got sick every couple of years.
[03:45:27.020 --> 03:45:31.142]  And, you know, I still get sore throats from allergies and pollen and things like that.
[03:45:31.142 --> 03:45:42.488]  But, now that I religiously take the products and InfoWars Life, one of the highest quality supplements you're going to find out there, I just never get a fever anymore.
[03:45:42.488 --> 03:45:47.691]  It's probably been three, four years since I've had a fever.
[03:45:47.691 --> 03:45:49.072]  It's just crazy.
[03:45:49.072 --> 03:45:51.213]  So I chalk it up to genetics and the great products.
[03:45:51.894 --> 03:45:53.595]  I love watching David Knight in the morning.
[03:45:53.595 --> 03:45:55.716]  I love tuning in to Owen Schroyer.
[03:45:55.716 --> 03:45:57.477]  I love all the other shows we do here.
[03:45:57.477 --> 03:45:59.217]  But I'll be honest with you.
[03:45:59.217 --> 03:46:04.560]  We run, during the breaks, a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[03:46:04.560 --> 03:46:06.421]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad?
[03:46:06.421 --> 03:46:07.721]  I don't want to hear an ad.
[03:46:07.721 --> 03:46:09.482]  But here's the bottom line.
[03:46:09.482 --> 03:46:10.963]  We're barely paying the bills here.
[03:46:10.963 --> 03:46:13.664]  And I want to expand to the face of the globalist, not contract.
[03:46:13.664 --> 03:46:14.825]  I don't want them to win.
[03:46:14.825 --> 03:46:15.625]  So listen.
[03:46:15.625 --> 03:46:16.766]  You've got this guarantee from me.
[03:46:17.728 --> 03:46:20.830]  We sell enough product, we'll have less ads and less plugs.
[03:46:20.830 --> 03:46:23.992]  And we'll expand and really give the globals a run for their money.
[03:46:23.992 --> 03:46:27.795]  But we've got products you already really need, like DNA Force Plus, X2.
[03:46:27.795 --> 03:46:29.356]  These will change your life.
[03:46:29.356 --> 03:46:30.777]  Go check out the turmeric products.
[03:46:30.777 --> 03:46:32.778]  Check out the water filtration, air filtration.
[03:46:32.778 --> 03:46:33.499]  Check it all out.
[03:46:33.499 --> 03:46:35.420]  Whatever you do, take action and know.
[03:46:35.420 --> 03:46:37.201]  Be part of the Second American Revolution.
[03:46:37.201 --> 03:46:38.582]  Be part of crushing the globalists.
[03:46:38.582 --> 03:46:40.163]  You'll get great products at the same time.
[03:46:40.163 --> 03:46:42.645]  Infowarsstore.com is the umbrella site.
[03:46:42.645 --> 03:46:44.826]  Infowarslife.com is the supplements.
[03:46:44.826 --> 03:46:47.688]  Take action now and fund the Infowar for your own future.
[03:46:55.434 --> 03:47:09.064]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:09.064 --> 03:47:13.628]  On a warm summer's evening, On a train bound for Norway,
[03:47:14.657 --> 03:47:20.539]  It's a good song, Kenny Rogers.
[03:47:20.539 --> 03:47:25.060]  But we don't have time to listen to this song, do we?
[03:47:25.060 --> 03:47:29.602]  We're going to talk to Mike, Alex, and Michael, and then we're going to end this transmission.
[03:47:29.602 --> 03:47:38.264]  And Owen Schroer is going to be live from the Crip Keeper Convention, also known as the Democrat Final Debate.
[03:47:38.264 --> 03:47:41.545]  Where are they holding that?
[03:47:41.545 --> 03:47:41.885]  Somewhere?
[03:47:41.885 --> 03:47:43.406]  I forget where it's at.
[03:47:45.390 --> 03:47:47.712]  Drake University, but where is Drake University?
[03:47:47.712 --> 03:47:50.535]  Des Moines, Iowa.
[03:47:50.535 --> 03:47:52.457]  Ah, that's right.
[03:47:52.457 --> 03:47:56.321]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to Mike in New York.
[03:47:56.321 --> 03:47:58.443]  Let's talk about June 21 and more.
[03:47:58.443 --> 03:47:58.963]  Go ahead, sir.
[03:47:58.963 --> 03:47:59.524]  Thanks for calling.
[03:48:01.209 --> 03:48:02.771]  Thank you, Alex, for the time.
[03:48:02.771 --> 03:48:16.784]  I just wanted to let you know, and the other intro warriors, that I was part of the 2010 Census, and looking forward, it was pretty crazy what they encouraged us to do as far as lying.
[03:48:16.784 --> 03:48:26.273]  I was living in downtown L.A., and they basically trained us to count homeless people over and over again.
[03:48:26.852 --> 03:48:27.272]  Okay.
[03:48:46.747 --> 03:48:53.769]  We could guess the age or use the ethnicity as a blank and say, choose not to vote.
[03:48:53.769 --> 03:48:57.609]  And for those that don't know, they would count illegal aliens, homeless people, over and over again.
[03:48:57.609 --> 03:49:04.091]  Then that gets more members of Congress, a portion of that, and more government funding than swindled by the Democrats.
[03:49:04.091 --> 03:49:11.173]  And then the illegal aliens are given driver's licenses and allowed to vote openly and publicly, something the Democrats always denied.
[03:49:11.173 --> 03:49:13.073]  This is a criminal takeover.
[03:49:14.352 --> 03:49:15.213]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:49:15.213 --> 03:49:21.118]  I mean, I'm scared now to get an Uber because in New York, they let anyone get a driver's license.
[03:49:21.118 --> 03:49:28.444]  And what's really scary is in the 2020 census that they're now saying you can just register online.
[03:49:28.444 --> 03:49:32.248]  So, you know, who's guarding that?
[03:49:32.248 --> 03:49:37.973]  Well, hey, courts have been ruling in Canada and England and a bunch of other places
[03:49:39.850 --> 03:49:45.988]  And Colorado just did this, where a transgender, can be anybody they want, can go get another birth certificate.
[03:49:48.380 --> 03:49:50.963]  I mean, they're just opening everything up for fraud.
[03:49:50.963 --> 03:49:53.505]  It's Cloward and Piven to bankrupt the country.
[03:49:53.505 --> 03:50:02.413]  That is an official Democrat policy to bankrupt the nation because they can't defeat capitalism, so they have to bankrupt it so people think socialism, but it won't be socialism.
[03:50:02.413 --> 03:50:13.343]  It'll be a bunch of offshore megabanks handing out chicken feed to everybody who thinks that that's all there is, and then they'll be ready to kill for a cup of milk when they could have had everything, these idiots.
[03:50:13.343 --> 03:50:13.824]  Gosh!
[03:50:15.225 --> 03:50:16.668]  Yeah, it's absolutely awful.
[03:50:16.668 --> 03:50:20.815]  And that's why I think when you're in a big city like New York or LA, you really have to...
[03:50:21.813 --> 03:50:29.776]  Um, you know, find your fellow patriots and speak out because I think that there's a lot more, um, you know, that have been in hiding.
[03:50:29.776 --> 03:50:31.577]  There's so many.
[03:50:31.577 --> 03:50:48.402]  And by the way, the fact that most of the folks in New York are Hispanic from all over the Caribbean, you name it, Latin America, coming here, I'm not against them individually, but if, let's say you're in Mexico City and there's a couple thousand gringos lined up getting driver's licenses without even having to take the test, the Mexicans would kick your ass and they should!
[03:50:48.402 --> 03:50:49.643]  It's not normal!
[03:50:50.083 --> 03:50:52.044]  It's not normal anywhere.
[03:50:52.044 --> 03:50:54.986]  If you don't have borders, your countries will explode.
[03:50:54.986 --> 03:50:56.107]  Everybody knows that.
[03:50:56.107 --> 03:50:57.888]  You've got to have some system.
[03:50:57.888 --> 03:51:00.910]  The extreme right-wing libertarians say, oh, we're going to have anarchy.
[03:51:00.910 --> 03:51:05.033]  Yeah, and it ends up being what you got in areas of Mexico where there is anarchy.
[03:51:05.033 --> 03:51:08.175]  It's all completely out of control.
[03:51:08.175 --> 03:51:09.116]  It's insane.
[03:51:10.216 --> 03:51:10.956]  God bless you, brother.
[03:51:10.956 --> 03:51:13.037]  Do a video on it.
[03:51:13.037 --> 03:51:13.657]  File a report.
[03:51:13.657 --> 03:51:15.718]  Just everybody get your messages out.
[03:51:15.718 --> 03:51:16.679]  Meet fellow patriots.
[03:51:16.679 --> 03:51:17.459]  Be a leader.
[03:51:17.459 --> 03:51:19.980]  And the best way is to be a local news person.
[03:51:19.980 --> 03:51:24.282]  Just say you're covering local news and then start having meet and greets and they will come.
[03:51:24.282 --> 03:51:25.002]  They will come.
[03:51:25.002 --> 03:51:25.622]  They will come.
[03:51:25.622 --> 03:51:26.263]  They will come.
[03:51:26.263 --> 03:51:27.243]  They will come.
[03:51:27.243 --> 03:51:29.624]  Because they could take us off the air and take us down.
[03:51:29.624 --> 03:51:31.245]  That's not a victory for them.
[03:51:31.245 --> 03:51:37.507]  That's like somebody who's been in a war 25 years and had devastating victories and then they finally get taken out.
[03:51:37.507 --> 03:51:38.248]  It's not a big deal.
[03:51:39.008 --> 03:51:49.683]  We're probably not going to get taken out, but just don't let them take InfoWars' destruction and make it some victory where we're like a scalp and they run around, you know, dancing like the Democrats do with baby scalps.
[03:51:49.683 --> 03:51:52.366]  You know, it came out in the news, the Democrats have baby scalps out in California.
[03:51:52.366 --> 03:51:54.289]  They like to keep them and do things with them.
[03:51:54.289 --> 03:51:54.970]  Makes them feel powerful.
[03:51:57.239 --> 03:51:58.801]  So don't ever let them have a victory.
[03:51:58.801 --> 03:52:00.543]  We're winning the war, they're losing.
[03:52:00.543 --> 03:52:01.965]  They're scum and they're filth.
[03:52:01.965 --> 03:52:02.986]  Remember that.
[03:52:02.986 --> 03:52:04.408]  I'm not just saying we're winning the war.
[03:52:04.408 --> 03:52:08.973]  They're always saying I'm losing and putting out fake reports to make you think you're losing.
[03:52:08.973 --> 03:52:11.777]  So don't couple yourself with info wars.
[03:52:11.777 --> 03:52:12.958]  We didn't invent all this.
[03:52:12.958 --> 03:52:13.979]  We're just promoting freedom.
[03:52:14.540 --> 03:52:15.501]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[03:52:15.501 --> 03:52:16.922]  Thanks for taking my call.
[03:52:43.208 --> 03:52:48.992]  So yeah, I spoke to Owen yesterday real quick, but I got disconnected.
[03:52:48.992 --> 03:52:50.153]  So I wanted to call back in.
[03:52:50.153 --> 03:53:01.701]  I was the one who called about the fact that I developed kidney disease from the BSA and vaccines and found out a few years ago.
[03:53:01.701 --> 03:53:06.425]  And I've been on dialysis for about three years now.
[03:53:06.425 --> 03:53:12.369]  And in all this research that I've been doing, I have really found that that is in fact
[03:53:12.987 --> 03:53:21.592]  What it was and I don't know if you're aware of this document from the National Academy of Sciences National Research Council.
[03:53:21.592 --> 03:53:35.640]  It was declassified in 1980 and this document is entitled Committee on the Effects of Long-Term Immunization with Multiple Antigens.
[03:53:35.640 --> 03:53:41.043]  Committee on the Effects of Multiple Immunizations by the National Research Council and
[03:53:42.057 --> 03:53:59.163]  In the conclusion part of this, I guess, white paper, it says, and this is verbatim from the paper, systematic studies including several measures of immune complex or autoimmune diseases should be undertaken in a suitable sample of Army personnel
[03:53:59.775 --> 03:54:05.540]  Who have recently been immunized or who will be immunized repeatedly over long periods.
[03:54:05.540 --> 03:54:15.508]  Clinical and lab controls should help to determine whether any of these persons have or will have symptoms related to immune complex or autoimmune disorders.
[03:54:15.508 --> 03:54:26.657]  Laboratory tests should be performed before the beginning of immunization, three months after the beginning of immunization, and every year for five years after the beginning of immunization.
[03:54:27.597 --> 03:54:29.519]  So this was their recommendation.
[03:54:29.519 --> 03:54:30.960]  But of course that was never done.
[03:54:30.960 --> 03:54:34.263]  And you just heard the UN say the exact same thing.
[03:54:34.263 --> 03:54:40.009]  And yes, whatever else is mixed in there, your body gets an allergic response to that in many cases.
[03:54:40.009 --> 03:54:46.795]  And then if it's been grown on fetal tissue, your body starts having an autoimmune response to your own tissue.
[03:54:46.795 --> 03:54:50.439]  And then your kidneys go out and they know it and it says it on the insert.
[03:54:50.959 --> 03:54:57.841]  But they tell everybody that's a lie, because they're criminal, sick, murdering filth, and they know exactly what they're doing, brother.
[03:54:57.841 --> 03:55:06.603]  And I have seen that document, other documents, but just so memory serves, give folks that name of the document again so they can go read it for themselves.
[03:55:06.603 --> 03:55:12.684]  Yeah, it's effects of long-term immunization with multiple antigens.
[03:55:12.684 --> 03:55:17.505]  Final report by the committee on the effects of multiple immunizations
[03:55:18.174 --> 03:55:21.095]  National Research Council, January 1980.
[03:55:21.095 --> 03:55:24.796]  All right, you're amazing, and I want to just put you on hold.
[03:55:24.796 --> 03:55:26.297]  You held so long to say all that.
[03:55:26.297 --> 03:55:34.680]  I'm sure Owen Schroer is going to want to go to you for another five minutes on his show to repeat that, if you'll hold, sir, because, yeah, there it is.
[03:55:34.680 --> 03:55:35.980]  Level two.
[03:55:35.980 --> 03:55:37.741]  That means who gets to see that and who doesn't.
[03:55:37.741 --> 03:55:38.261]  Yeah, there it is.
[03:55:38.261 --> 03:55:39.722]  In fact, print that for me.
[03:55:39.722 --> 03:55:40.102]  Yeah, folks.
[03:55:41.075 --> 03:55:46.802]  How about State Department Memorandum 200, where Henry Kissinger talks about how they're going to depopulate the planet?
[03:55:46.802 --> 03:55:48.044]  Because it's liberal, though.
[03:55:48.044 --> 03:55:50.787]  It's always liberal and loving to do it.
[03:55:50.787 --> 03:55:51.628]  So, that's what I mean.
[03:55:51.628 --> 03:55:52.970]  Yeah, have I gone crazy knowing all this?
[03:55:52.970 --> 03:55:54.091]  You bet!
[03:55:54.091 --> 03:55:55.874]  People are like, how are you taking it, Alex?
[03:55:55.874 --> 03:55:57.215]  I see you're being attacked.
[03:55:57.215 --> 03:55:58.957]  People walk up grocery stores, just keep it up.
[03:55:58.957 --> 03:55:59.598]  Sorry to hear you.
[03:56:00.666 --> 03:56:03.708]  Lost that criminal case for the Sandy Hook children.
[03:56:03.708 --> 03:56:04.968]  There is no criminal case.
[03:56:04.968 --> 03:56:06.249]  I didn't lose anything.
[03:56:06.249 --> 03:56:09.251]  But again, they just make it that everywhere.
[03:56:09.251 --> 03:56:11.112]  Every newscast, Sandy Hook, Alex Jones, Sandy Hook.
[03:56:11.112 --> 03:56:13.914]  They're like, did you kill the kids?
[03:56:13.914 --> 03:56:16.415]  That's all because I'm up here telling you what they're doing!
[03:56:16.415 --> 03:56:18.776]  And they don't want that!
[03:56:18.776 --> 03:56:22.558]  So they create this narrative that I'm hurting children.
[03:56:22.558 --> 03:56:25.140]  Children that another person killed.
[03:56:25.140 --> 03:56:29.322]  Because we question all these big events because they've been caught lying so many times in other big cases.
[03:56:31.536 --> 03:56:34.637]  Michael to hold him over into the war room.
[03:56:34.637 --> 03:56:35.837]  I can't go host the war room.
[03:56:35.837 --> 03:56:41.599]  I've got to shoot all the ads and promos for the operations we're launching to get Trump's attention.
[03:56:41.599 --> 03:56:43.540]  Operation 2020.
[03:56:43.540 --> 03:56:45.300]  Operation Win 2020.
[03:56:45.300 --> 03:56:46.321]  And the website.
[03:56:46.321 --> 03:56:47.241]  I'm not complaining.
[03:56:47.241 --> 03:56:48.141]  I love this work.
[03:56:48.141 --> 03:56:50.322]  I've got a lot to do and I'm going to enjoy it.
[03:56:51.192 --> 03:56:52.832]  Because we are going to save humanity.
[03:56:52.832 --> 03:56:54.213]  We're not going to let these people do this.
[03:56:54.213 --> 03:56:56.814]  But Alex and Michael, transfer them over to Owen.
[03:56:56.814 --> 03:56:57.774]  Owen, I'm sure, will understand.
[03:56:57.774 --> 03:56:58.714]  He'll want to talk to them.
[03:56:58.714 --> 03:57:04.176]  Because I want Michael or Alex to be able to finish what they had to say.
[03:57:04.176 --> 03:57:05.576]  It's so important.
[03:57:05.576 --> 03:57:06.737]  I'm out of time.
[03:57:06.737 --> 03:57:07.777]  The fish oil is back in.
[03:57:07.777 --> 03:57:08.797]  It is the ultimate fish oil.
[03:57:08.797 --> 03:57:10.178]  It's the best formula we could find.
[03:57:10.178 --> 03:57:13.498]  And we said we want the most, the best ever.
[03:57:13.498 --> 03:57:14.739]  And they said this is what it costs.
[03:57:15.419 --> 03:57:21.105]  And then they're like, you know, mark it up five times, it'd be a hundred bucks if we were putting into this.
[03:57:21.105 --> 03:57:21.866]  I'm like, no.
[03:57:21.866 --> 03:57:22.627]  So, it's $29.95 right now.
[03:57:22.627 --> 03:57:23.929]  That is an incredible deal.
[03:57:23.929 --> 03:57:25.270]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:57:25.270 --> 03:57:26.872]  Fishwell's changed my life.
[03:57:26.872 --> 03:57:28.654]  Everybody sees I'm healthier, look younger.
[03:57:28.654 --> 03:57:30.156]  It really, really helps.
[03:57:30.156 --> 03:57:32.178]  And we've also got Prostagard, back in stock.
[03:57:32.178 --> 03:57:33.379]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:57:33.379 --> 03:57:35.121]  That's it for this transmission.
[03:57:35.121 --> 03:57:36.703]  Warren Rimmel and Schroeder, coming up.
