[00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.212]  Logic is the enemy and truth is a menace.
[00:00:15.212 --> 00:00:21.075]  Rod Serling, Twilight Zone author, 1962.
[00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:25.978]  Well, here we are on this Monday live edition of the Alex Jones broadcast in the year 2020.
[00:00:25.978 --> 00:00:33.322]  With only 147, 148 days left until the historic election.
[00:00:33.322 --> 00:00:35.484]  We are seeing the armies of ignorance attack.
[00:00:36.516 --> 00:00:43.480]  We've seen Black Lives Matter and Antifa attack the Black Civil War Memorial, the Glory Memorial in D.C.
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.761]  That wasn't enough.
[00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:46.962]  They went on to attack the Lincoln Memorial.
[00:00:46.962 --> 00:00:49.923]  Then they attacked the World War II Memorial.
[00:00:49.923 --> 00:00:56.187]  And their Soros-funded cohorts in the United Kingdom attacked the police.
[00:00:56.187 --> 00:00:57.828]  BBC called it peaceful.
[00:00:57.828 --> 00:01:01.990]  They then tried to attack and pull down the statue of Mr. Churchill.
[00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:13.525]  Saying he was the king of the fascists, while declaring themselves equivalent to the D-Day Normandy landings that face German machine gun desks.
[00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:15.586]  This is Maoist Youth Brigade.
[00:01:15.586 --> 00:01:17.766]  That's their official operating system.
[00:01:17.766 --> 00:01:29.190]  I started first seeing this about 15 years ago in Austin, where the local groups at UT and ACC actually wear Maoist, communist, revolutionary uniforms.
[00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.871]  So, they're not just LARPing now.
[00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.572]  They're trying to overthrow and pull down the government.
[00:01:34.572 --> 00:01:52.447]  Now, they're just the front-level decoys, but it's powerful megabanks and people like Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett and Ted Turner and all of these different globalist minions that are orchestrating and funding all of this while they run with trillions offshore.
[00:01:52.447 --> 00:01:53.869]  They're trying to create a culture war.
[00:01:55.379 --> 00:02:05.823]  In the West, while opening our borders to the third world, teaching the third world that whiteness is bad, whites are taught to be guilty, so we then accept whatever the United Nations, the globalist push.
[00:02:05.823 --> 00:02:18.668]  And the UN, under State Department memorandum 7277, openly states that they would open the borders, let us the third world, replace the populations, and then demand that not just the citizens, but the police be disarmed.
[00:02:18.668 --> 00:02:25.050]  But as the police are disarmed, and as the military is disarmed, the United Nations is armed.
[00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.115]  This is all official canon doctrine of the globalist playbook.
[00:02:31.115 --> 00:02:33.436]  Owen Schreuer is taking over in the first hour.
[00:02:33.436 --> 00:02:34.777]  I'll be back in the second and third hour.
[00:02:34.777 --> 00:02:40.662]  Paul Joseph Watson will be joining me out of the gates in the second hour to break down the attempts to overthrow the British government.
[00:02:41.042 --> 00:02:42.563]  Not the Globalist who's orchestrating it.
[00:02:42.563 --> 00:02:58.529]  But first, there's a big story on Infowars.com how Instagram, you need to share it, they don't want people to see it, banned as violating community guidelines, putting out FBI crime statistics that have even been in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:03.311]  The latest statistics we have are from two years ago, and it shows that the lowest level of crime
[00:03:04.051 --> 00:03:07.034]  In the United States is white on black.
[00:03:07.034 --> 00:03:09.516]  The highest level of crime is black on white.
[00:03:09.516 --> 00:03:10.837]  And then it shows the other statistics.
[00:03:10.837 --> 00:03:15.000]  So this is what Black Lives Matter really sterilized the black people.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.844]  Planned Parenthood 2.0, that's actually who funds it, is saying it's asinine.
[00:03:19.844 --> 00:03:24.668]  It's creating a psychological wound in the public that they're bad because they're white.
[00:03:24.668 --> 00:03:27.510]  And then trying to hype up minorities, mainly women,
[00:03:28.251 --> 00:03:28.671]  I think?
[00:03:49.898 --> 00:04:01.403]  They've also done it in Canada, where Dan Dix peacefully tried to cover Antifa BLM demonstrations and was arrested after the Antifa scum physically attacked him.
[00:04:01.403 --> 00:04:03.924]  But they can't silence all of you.
[00:04:03.924 --> 00:04:13.848]  So share the article from NewsWars.com or InfoWars.com with the actual FBI crime statistics on the ground.
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.841]  Showing the truth of what's really happening.
[00:04:18.841 --> 00:04:29.165]  That there is an over 10 to 1 black on white crime rate, mainly because the media encourages it and helps cover it up and acts like it's some rite of passage to go out and rob white people.
[00:04:29.165 --> 00:04:32.046]  This is what they don't want you to share, but you can stop them.
[00:04:32.046 --> 00:04:34.527]  Go to InfoWars.com now.
[00:04:34.527 --> 00:04:44.491]  Get the article about the censored graphs and statistics that Mark Zuckerberg doesn't want you to see and share it, share it, share it on your email, share it in your
[00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:45.312]  We're good to go.
[00:04:58.993 --> 00:05:17.207]  I've been fighting the globalists for 26 years and the evil side of me is just so tired of waiting and I'm so ready for physical war that I'm kind of happy about how bad things have gotten because all the delusional folks that don't stand up for the unborn babies that go along with the new world order, you're about to find out just how sick stuff is.
[00:05:17.207 --> 00:05:18.008]  But you know what?
[00:05:18.008 --> 00:05:19.569]  The average person is still asleep.
[00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.371]  They don't deserve what's happening to them.
[00:05:21.371 --> 00:05:22.412]  So I'm actually sick
[00:05:23.172 --> 00:05:26.235]  About what's unfolding right now, and I just want to turn things around.
[00:05:26.235 --> 00:05:27.216]  But you know what?
[00:05:27.216 --> 00:05:29.298]  I can't do that without you.
[00:05:29.298 --> 00:05:30.660]  I can't get out of this mess.
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.644]  I can't get out of this stranglehold I'm in unless you decide to get out of it as well.
[00:05:34.644 --> 00:05:35.565]  We're all in this together.
[00:05:35.565 --> 00:05:41.211]  And so if you just realize how important you are, when you just tell people about the local radio stations you're listening to, local TV stations,
[00:05:41.551 --> 00:05:48.157]  When you just spread the word about InfoWars.com, when you just buy the products at InfoWarsStore.com, it changes the world.
[00:05:48.157 --> 00:05:51.901]  Right now, we've got a special that's about to end.

[00:06:08.681 --> 00:06:12.323]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is Monday, June 8, 2020.
[00:06:12.323 --> 00:06:18.205]  This is the InfoWars.com Alex Jones Show.
[00:06:18.205 --> 00:06:21.027]  Filling in for Alex here in the first hour, I'm your host, Owen Schroer.
[00:06:21.027 --> 00:06:37.214]  Alex will be back, second hour, with Paul Joseph Watson from the UK, where they're tearing down memorials and monuments and marching for George Floyd!
[00:06:39.056 --> 00:06:41.918]  Which has absolutely nothing to do with the UK.
[00:06:41.918 --> 00:06:54.086]  Of course, the police in the UK are already disarmed, and so when a mob of BLM or whoever chases after them, they literally run and scurry because they can't even defend themselves.
[00:06:54.086 --> 00:06:59.889]  And now that's what they're trying to do to police here in the United States.
[00:06:59.889 --> 00:07:04.833]  You know, I'm thinking, what should I start the show with?
[00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:08.515]  Because, you know, Alex has this chessboard on
[00:07:10.017 --> 00:07:10.597]  The desk here.
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.841]  Bishop?
[00:07:42.841 --> 00:07:44.602]  Or is it the Rook?
[00:07:44.602 --> 00:07:45.302]  Well, I don't know.
[00:07:45.302 --> 00:07:48.844]  I think that that's complicated.
[00:07:48.844 --> 00:07:52.065]  But what is the pawn?
[00:07:52.065 --> 00:07:53.066]  Ah!
[00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:54.827]  See, the pawn is easy.
[00:07:54.827 --> 00:07:56.307]  The pawn is easy to manipulate.
[00:07:56.307 --> 00:07:58.829]  The pawn is easy to understand.
[00:07:58.829 --> 00:08:09.094]  And so on this chessboard that we look at the current political situation with, with the globalists playing us off against each other to death,
[00:08:10.896 --> 00:08:14.817]  Well, who is the pawn of the globalist?
[00:08:14.817 --> 00:08:26.559]  Well, there is no better example of a brainwashed fool, a pawn, than a Soros protester with a face mask on.
[00:08:26.559 --> 00:08:34.661]  So that's somebody protesting for Black Lives Matter with their face mask on.
[00:08:34.661 --> 00:08:38.322]  Now, as you heard from Alex in the stories at InfoWars.com, the headline,
[00:08:39.252 --> 00:08:42.694]  Instagram censors FBI crime stats graph as hate speech.
[00:08:42.694 --> 00:08:48.137]  Now the one that they're censoring, which is, this is an old meme, almost 10 years old.
[00:08:48.137 --> 00:08:49.217]  But it's all the same difference.
[00:08:49.217 --> 00:08:50.958]  It's FBI statistics.
[00:08:50.958 --> 00:08:52.099]  They're in the Washington Post.
[00:08:52.099 --> 00:08:53.880]  They're in the Wall Street Journal.
[00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.540]  And it's what we already know.
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:57.681]  The highest crime rate is black on white.
[00:08:57.681 --> 00:09:01.123]  It's not even close.
[00:09:01.123 --> 00:09:04.965]  But they know that defeats the mainstream news narrative.
[00:09:04.965 --> 00:09:08.147]  And if their pawns ever figured that out, maybe they wouldn't march.
[00:09:09.468 --> 00:09:18.593]  But let's step back from the board for a second because we've been playing this game for a long time.
[00:09:18.593 --> 00:09:24.657]  Now if you play chess you know that a pawn is pretty much the weakest member of your team.
[00:09:24.657 --> 00:09:27.218]  It's the weakest piece on the board.
[00:09:27.218 --> 00:09:29.180]  It can only go one way at a time.
[00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:31.261]  It can only go one square at a time.
[00:09:31.261 --> 00:09:36.344]  But that is the essence of the brainwashed Soros protester because
[00:09:38.228 --> 00:09:46.770]  They are moved one square at a time on the board to ultimate death.
[00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:50.550]  And so if you just look at the last four years, what has it been?
[00:09:50.550 --> 00:10:00.072]  Well, it's all been out to get Trump, but think about how the mainstream media and the Democrat Party and the globalists move their pawns, which are currently marching for Black Lives Matter.
[00:10:00.072 --> 00:10:03.052]  Or who knows, maybe they've already switched it.
[00:10:03.052 --> 00:10:04.933]  Is it global warming yet, or what is it now?
[00:10:04.933 --> 00:10:06.053]  Is it still Black Lives Matter?
[00:10:06.053 --> 00:10:06.313]  I don't know.
[00:10:07.895 --> 00:10:15.460]  But think about, and there have been marches for all of these things across the country in the last four years.
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.422]  And I realize this is their pawn.
[00:10:18.422 --> 00:10:21.244]  They move one square at a time.
[00:10:21.244 --> 00:10:23.946]  The globalists move their pawns one square at a time.
[00:10:23.946 --> 00:10:28.009]  So just look at the pawn or the attack on Trump.
[00:10:30.407 --> 00:10:40.399]  We have had marches for each and every one of these squares that the globalists and the media and Soros have moved their pawns forward with.
[00:10:40.399 --> 00:10:41.520]  Russian collusion.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:42.241]  You remember that one?
[00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:43.443]  Russian collusion.
[00:10:43.443 --> 00:10:45.605]  They were all out on the streets.
[00:10:45.605 --> 00:10:47.287]  Hashtag me too!
[00:10:47.287 --> 00:10:47.788]  Remember that?
[00:10:47.788 --> 00:10:48.529]  With the old tape?
[00:10:50.555 --> 00:10:51.155]  Remember that?
[00:10:51.155 --> 00:10:52.496]  Okay, so that was another one.
[00:10:52.496 --> 00:10:53.657]  They were out on the streets protesting.
[00:10:53.657 --> 00:10:57.340]  So that's the globalists and the media moving their pawn one square at a time.
[00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:58.981]  Because that's the weakness of the pawn.
[00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:00.302]  It can only go one square at a time.
[00:11:00.302 --> 00:11:03.024]  It can't see beyond the board.
[00:11:03.024 --> 00:11:04.966]  One square.
[00:11:04.966 --> 00:11:06.347]  Then he was unfit for office.
[00:11:06.347 --> 00:11:06.807]  Remember that?
[00:11:06.807 --> 00:11:08.948]  They had marches for that.
[00:11:08.948 --> 00:11:09.849]  Kids in cages.
[00:11:09.849 --> 00:11:10.249]  Remember?
[00:11:10.249 --> 00:11:11.450]  Trump was putting kids in cages.
[00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.152]  Didn't matter that the photo was from the Obama years that they all used.
[00:11:14.152 --> 00:11:16.694]  It was Trump's putting kids in cages.
[00:11:16.694 --> 00:11:17.255]  They had marches.
[00:11:18.217 --> 00:11:21.838]  Ukrainian quid pro quo, again, marches.
[00:11:21.838 --> 00:11:26.459]  The impeachment, the impeachment, the impeachment of Trump, marches.
[00:11:26.459 --> 00:11:28.460]  In the streets, protests.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.120]  Then COVID-19!
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.520]  Lock yourself inside.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.261]  Close your business.
[00:11:33.261 --> 00:11:36.402]  It's gonna kill us all.
[00:11:36.402 --> 00:11:39.062]  And then you're still seeing they're all buying into it.
[00:11:39.062 --> 00:11:39.962]  But what is the latest?
[00:11:39.962 --> 00:11:43.383]  Black Lives Matter, George Floyd.
[00:11:43.383 --> 00:11:45.484]  And you see, this is how the media moves
[00:11:46.906 --> 00:11:49.669]  They're pawns, one square at a time.
[00:11:49.669 --> 00:12:01.621]  And because the pawn can only see one square ahead, it doesn't see the whole board, it doesn't see how it's being manipulated, it doesn't see how it's being moved.
[00:12:01.621 --> 00:12:09.489]  And it's never been more clear who the pawns of mainstream media and the Democrat Party and George Soros and the globalists are.
[00:12:09.489 --> 00:12:10.630]  It's never been more clear.
[00:12:12.076 --> 00:12:19.560]  And let me tell ya, if you have been to every single one of the protests and marches that I've just mentioned, you are peak brainwashed.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.221]  You cannot be more brainwashed.
[00:12:22.221 --> 00:12:24.623]  It doesn't get worse for you.
[00:12:24.623 --> 00:12:32.147]  But, as soon as they blow the whistle for the next move, to move you one square forward, you'll be there.
[00:12:32.147 --> 00:12:33.948]  What's it gonna be next?
[00:12:33.948 --> 00:12:35.669]  Climate change?
[00:12:35.669 --> 00:12:38.770]  Global warming?
[00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:41.712]  Some other hoax we can't even concoct or imagine yet?
[00:12:44.707 --> 00:12:52.112]  Now here's what the Magic 8 Ball tells us.
[00:12:52.112 --> 00:13:04.160]  They're going to infiltrate one of these Black Lives Matter rallies or something and try to set it up with either a mass shooting or a dirty bomb.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.843]  Now I personally think that's what they just did last week.
[00:13:07.843 --> 00:13:09.604]  They may go for it one more week.
[00:13:09.604 --> 00:13:10.445]  I don't know if it's going to work.
[00:13:12.517 --> 00:13:22.934]  Because remember, they, the police officers in multiple counties found explosives, water bottles, squirt guns full of gasoline.
[00:13:22.934 --> 00:13:25.879]  So I mean, they, they put the bricks out there.
[00:13:27.076 --> 00:13:30.097]  So they really lined it up for this to pop off with mass death.
[00:13:30.097 --> 00:13:35.980]  Now, they only got, I think, so far about 20 to 30 dead, most of which are black.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.200]  Nobody cares about them.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.741]  It's still all about George Floyd.
[00:13:38.741 --> 00:13:42.222]  He gets to have a funeral and a memorial and a gold casket.
[00:13:42.222 --> 00:13:54.088]  You have to stay inside and hope that you can find a roll of toilet paper because of COVID, even though they're out, you know, looting and rioting and it's all good.
[00:13:54.088 --> 00:13:54.888]  But think about that.
[00:13:56.374 --> 00:14:08.200]  Think about the power of the grand players on the chessboard to move that pawn whenever and wherever they want.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:09.500]  And there they go.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.181]  And that's how they respond.
[00:14:11.181 --> 00:14:22.727]  This is, of course, in the UK where they tore down a statue of Edward Colston and then danced on it because that's social justice.
[00:14:26.067 --> 00:14:52.216]  Of course you've got, and I'm sure Paul Joseph Watson is going to talk about this, they desecrated a Winston Churchill statue, UK police were in the area, and instead of stopping the people that destroyed the monument, you know, spray painted it and everything, this gentleman cleared up some of the trash from the monument and tore down some of the signs on the monument and the police went after him!
[00:14:52.216 --> 00:14:55.337]  If you can't spell clown world without liberal,
[00:14:57.039 --> 00:15:02.881]  Well, if that doesn't make sense to you, it doesn't even matter because the clown world's not supposed to make sense.
[00:15:02.881 --> 00:15:03.481]  So there it is.
[00:15:03.481 --> 00:15:09.364]  So the bad man who tried to pick up the trash and clean up the monument, the police chased after him.
[00:15:09.364 --> 00:15:12.725]  Literally.
[00:15:12.725 --> 00:15:18.727]  By the way, we've got 82-year-old veteran violently attacked over support for Trump just in his yard in a Trump hat.
[00:15:18.727 --> 00:15:21.048]  Someone comes by and, you know, whoops, whoops wide his ass.
[00:15:22.833 --> 00:15:28.918]  And then, but it's not even about old Whitey, because old Blacky gets hurt too.
[00:15:28.918 --> 00:15:38.325]  Because an old man had an American flag t-shirt on at the subway in New York, was getting harassed.
[00:15:38.325 --> 00:15:40.246]  And he said, I happen to like President Trump.
[00:15:41.215 --> 00:15:44.258]  Some thug comes up to him and punches him out, knocks him out cold.
[00:15:44.258 --> 00:15:47.480]  Because that's how you be a real man.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:56.688]  That's how you be a real rebel against the establishment, is by going after the biggest anti-establishment president you've ever seen, and then punching an 80-year-old guy in the face out.
[00:15:56.688 --> 00:15:57.729]  That's real hard.
[00:15:57.729 --> 00:16:00.091]  I'm always excited about InfoWars Life products.
[00:16:00.091 --> 00:16:06.056]  They're amazing, they're cutting edge, you love them, I love them, and they fund the InfoWars in the face of the globalist onslaught.
[00:16:06.056 --> 00:16:10.019]  But, we have come up with a new product, over a year in development,
[00:16:11.164 --> 00:16:12.805]  That is amazing.
[00:16:12.805 --> 00:16:20.469]  The only organic hand sanitizer on the market with organic essential oils on top of it.
[00:16:20.469 --> 00:16:22.790]  And there's another innovation.
[00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:24.871]  It's the spray cap.
[00:16:24.871 --> 00:16:30.294]  It doesn't just pour out a bunch of thick, gross goo, but it's high quality.
[00:16:30.294 --> 00:16:32.475]  It aerosolizes it in a really great way.
[00:16:32.475 --> 00:16:33.376]  I like to put it on my hands.
[00:16:34.116 --> 00:16:35.617]  Rub a little bit on my face.
[00:16:35.617 --> 00:16:38.438]  It's got organic alcohol in it, so don't spray it right in your eyes.
[00:16:38.438 --> 00:16:42.840]  But I just love it, personally, as something that's a moisturizer as well.
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.641]  So, this is a real innovation.
[00:16:44.641 --> 00:16:51.164]  I don't know why others didn't think of coming out with a hand sanitizer that actually has essential oil in it, so it doesn't dry you out.
[00:16:51.164 --> 00:16:52.525]  Smells great.
[00:16:52.525 --> 00:16:54.345]  It's so refreshing.
[00:16:54.345 --> 00:16:55.206]  This is a big winner.
[00:16:57.622 --> 00:17:08.693]  Hey guys, Rob Dew here with InfoWarsStore.com, and I want to tell you about something that I think has really helped me out, and I think can help you out too, especially if you have any problems sleeping, and that's knockout.
[00:17:08.693 --> 00:17:17.021]  Let's face it, our life patterns have been disrupted by this lockdown, this government-imposed imprisonment, and it has definitely affected my sleep schedule.
[00:17:17.021 --> 00:17:18.422]  But one thing that has helped is knockout.
[00:17:18.642 --> 00:17:21.505]  I take one pill about an hour before I want to go to bed, and boom!
[00:17:21.505 --> 00:17:22.746]  I get a great night's sleep.
[00:17:22.746 --> 00:17:28.951]  And just this past Memorial Day, I took two of them, fell asleep about 1 a.m., woke up at 8 a.m., ready to go.
[00:17:28.951 --> 00:17:32.814]  It really has made a difference in my life, and it can make a difference in your life, too.
[00:17:32.814 --> 00:17:34.796]  If you don't get any sleep, you're gonna be a grouch.
[00:17:34.796 --> 00:17:36.737]  If you get great sleep, you're gonna be on point.
[00:17:36.737 --> 00:17:37.998]  You're gonna be mentally focused.
[00:17:37.998 --> 00:17:40.481]  You're gonna be ready to take on the day.
[00:17:40.481 --> 00:17:41.621]  And right now, knockout is 50% off.
[00:17:41.621 --> 00:17:42.462]  It's less than $15 a bottle.
[00:17:42.462 --> 00:17:42.943]  You get 30 capsules.
[00:17:45.865 --> 00:17:46.926]  Give it a try today.
[00:17:46.926 --> 00:17:53.029]  It's at a great price right now, and it can really help you get the sleep you need, especially in these tough times.
[00:17:53.029 --> 00:18:00.634]  It's Knockout, and it's available at Infowarestore.com.
[00:18:00.634 --> 00:18:03.256]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:18:15.857 --> 00:18:17.078]  You found it.
[00:18:17.078 --> 00:18:19.100]  The tip of the spear.
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:26.485]  It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[00:18:26.485 --> 00:18:28.367]  That's right.

[00:21:06.616 --> 00:21:23.859]  I've got some videos I want to get to here, and I've got some other news stories, but everything really derives, at least to the current chaos and madness, everything really derives from one thing.
[00:21:23.859 --> 00:21:29.700]  And it's briefly summarized in a story at the New York Post, but hardly in detail.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:34.341]  And the headline is, the lying about Donald Trump is now completely out of control.
[00:21:36.394 --> 00:21:40.896]  Because ladies and gentlemen, that's really what this is all about.
[00:21:40.896 --> 00:21:44.918]  I'm not saying there's not injustice or police brutality in this country.
[00:21:44.918 --> 00:21:47.659]  I don't think anybody's denying that.
[00:21:47.659 --> 00:21:57.523]  But how much of an issue is it really when we've got groups of white people taking knees for black people, groups of police taking knees, getting on their bellies.
[00:21:57.523 --> 00:21:59.965]  It's literally a form of submission.
[00:21:59.965 --> 00:22:03.686]  White people washing the feet of black people now in North Carolina.
[00:22:03.686 --> 00:22:04.947]  That's, yeah, that's happening.
[00:22:05.891 --> 00:22:09.902]  Democrats now, like, pretending they're Kunta Kinte or something.
[00:22:09.902 --> 00:22:11.908]  Wearing a African scarf.
[00:22:13.010 --> 00:22:16.112]  With now face masks that match it.
[00:22:16.112 --> 00:22:17.492]  I mean, this is a whole game for them.
[00:22:17.492 --> 00:22:20.514]  Jerry Nadler is such a fat plump, he can't even knee.
[00:22:20.514 --> 00:22:22.835]  So, I mean, he's got his own problems.
[00:22:22.835 --> 00:22:28.798]  And then he comes up here, he can't get his mask off, his glasses are falling off of his head, he looks like a complete moron.
[00:22:28.798 --> 00:22:32.480]  He's got some woman behind him with the Kunta Kinte face mask.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:35.061]  I mean, it's just, this whole thing is a joke.
[00:22:35.061 --> 00:22:41.224]  But here, I mean, at least Kunta Kinte, I mean, he was American.
[00:22:41.224 --> 00:22:42.345]  It's so clown world now.
[00:22:44.079 --> 00:22:45.400]  It's so clown world now.
[00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:55.549]  And so, you have to ask yourself, why is Instagram censoring FBI crime statistics that the Washington Post reports on, and the New York Times reports on, and the Wall Street Journal has?
[00:22:55.549 --> 00:23:04.656]  Why don't they want you to know about all the white people that are killed by police, but they're gonna tell you all day long about the black people like George Floyd?
[00:23:04.656 --> 00:23:10.101]  Which, you know, I'll be honest with you folks, because InfoWars is now the mothership
[00:23:11.786 --> 00:23:22.613]  Well, I'm gonna speak for myself here, but... Folks, this whole George Floyd thing is a big setup.
[00:23:22.613 --> 00:23:24.495]  Okay?
[00:23:24.495 --> 00:23:34.902]  And I'm just gonna leave it at that, because we don't have to get too conspiratorial, and because we are the mothership, it's just a turn-off when you get a little bit too conspiratorial for some people, and so we understand this rule.
[00:23:35.987 --> 00:23:47.678]  But every day people are sending me different stuff about Floyd and different stuff about the officer and the mug shots and everything and they're raising all kinds of red flags and you know what?
[00:23:47.678 --> 00:23:48.939]  I don't know, okay?
[00:23:48.939 --> 00:23:50.661]  I don't know what the truth is.
[00:23:50.661 --> 00:23:51.922]  I know we were set up.
[00:23:51.922 --> 00:23:53.543]  The Democrats were clearly planning this.
[00:23:54.628 --> 00:23:56.329]  Okay, they were clearly planning this.
[00:23:56.329 --> 00:24:00.190]  That's why they had the bailout reform so they could release all their prisoners.
[00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:03.371]  They clearly had their defund the police campaign ready to go.
[00:24:03.371 --> 00:24:07.452]  That's why they're rolling it out in perfect synchronicity.
[00:24:07.452 --> 00:24:14.654]  It's all way too perfectly rolled out to think that this was just a circumstantial thing.
[00:24:14.654 --> 00:24:19.296]  Not to mention, you've got Floyd's teacher doing interviews now, Dr. Analsex.
[00:24:19.296 --> 00:24:20.776]  Yeah.
[00:24:20.776 --> 00:24:22.717]  Dr. Analsex was on CNN.
[00:24:23.885 --> 00:24:24.765]  This weekend.
[00:24:48.933 --> 00:24:50.934]  I mean, you can go look at the conspiracy theories for yourself.
[00:24:50.934 --> 00:24:54.715]  Let me just tell you, it's not the first time that Dr. Analsex has been on CNN.
[00:24:54.715 --> 00:24:59.297]  But it's not been Dr. Analsex, it's been a different character at the time.
[00:24:59.297 --> 00:25:02.118]  But hey, I mean, I say Dr. Analsex is a hero!
[00:25:02.118 --> 00:25:11.402]  I mean, the bravery of that woman to go on CNN, Dr. Analsex, and tell you about how great George Floyd is.
[00:25:11.402 --> 00:25:17.224]  But so, that's what we really need though, is Dr. Analsex telling us how great George Floyd is on TV.
[00:25:18.411 --> 00:25:31.342]  And we need Instagram censoring FBI crime statistics that show that the highest rate of crime, a hundredfold, is black on white crime.
[00:25:31.342 --> 00:25:32.864]  But you see, CNN has it figured out.
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.505]  In fact, let me roll the clip from clip three here because CNN has it all figured out.
[00:25:37.505 --> 00:25:38.486]  I didn't realize this.
[00:25:38.486 --> 00:25:43.533]  See, when you're the victim of a crime, that actually, that's because you're privileged.
[00:25:43.533 --> 00:25:45.255]  See, CNN figured that out though.
[00:25:45.255 --> 00:25:51.404]  So here's a brilliant guest, probably friends with Dr. Anal Sex on CNN this weekend.
[00:25:52.688 --> 00:25:59.573]  So they're talking about defunding police and that's what needs to happen and get rid of the police department because that's that's how we save the world.
[00:26:24.369 --> 00:26:39.834]  Yes, I mean, I hear that loud and clear from a lot of my neighbors, and I know, and myself too, and I know that that comes from a place of privilege, because for those of us for whom the system is working, I think we need to step back and imagine what it would feel like.
[00:26:39.834 --> 00:26:49.898]  Yeah, so if you, you know, want to have a safe home and not have your home invaded, and you know, if your home is invaded, you expect to be able to call the police, well that's because of your privilege, don't you get it?
[00:26:50.908 --> 00:26:53.449]  Says, uh, the friend of Dr. Analsex on CNN.
[00:26:53.449 --> 00:26:55.170]  I mean, these people are your friends, folks.
[00:26:55.170 --> 00:26:56.451]  These people really care about you.
[00:27:10.259 --> 00:27:12.260]  They are not made in China.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.841]  They do not have fentanyl or lead.
[00:27:14.841 --> 00:27:33.627]  They are high quality, super male vitality, knockout sleep support, brain force, bio 2 cerium, chill force, ultramacryl oil, survival shield x2, DNA force blues, living defense and turbo force, x3 available as well.
[00:27:33.627 --> 00:27:35.428]  Listen to me, dirty Americans.

[00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:43.850]  You go bankrupt and die.

[00:27:45.291 --> 00:27:47.211]  InfoWars is weak.
[00:27:47.211 --> 00:27:48.772]  Do not take advantage of 60% off.
[00:27:48.772 --> 00:27:48.952]  G.G.
[00:27:48.952 --> 00:27:49.632]  Pink says so.
[00:27:49.632 --> 00:27:50.412]  Oh, we hurt you.
[00:27:50.412 --> 00:27:51.253]  Oh, Joe Biden good.
[00:27:57.367 --> 00:28:05.569]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:11.582]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[00:28:11.582 --> 00:28:13.944]  Super Male Vitality!
[00:28:13.944 --> 00:28:22.788]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[00:28:22.788 --> 00:28:33.634]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[00:28:33.934 --> 00:28:34.614]  Yes.

[00:28:56.744 --> 00:29:06.431]  I had told listeners back in December that I would never go to 50% off again because our markup isn't big enough selling the products to be able to fund ourselves doing that.
[00:29:06.431 --> 00:29:17.739]  But I gotta tell you, things are so crazy, the world is so insane, my gut level instinct is sell out everything we've got in the warehouse to make sure we can stay on air through the election in 150 days.

[00:30:17.759 --> 00:30:19.540]  Mainstream Media.
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:21.441]  Government cover-ups.
[00:30:21.441 --> 00:30:23.143]  You want to stop tyranny?
[00:30:23.143 --> 00:30:24.804]  Well, so does he.
[00:30:24.804 --> 00:30:29.887]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:30:29.887 --> 00:30:33.950]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:35.411]  Now, if you play chess,
[00:30:37.449 --> 00:30:40.451]  There's a bunch of different ways you can play.
[00:30:40.451 --> 00:30:45.073]  Personally, when I play chess, I am literally on the offense 24-7.
[00:30:45.073 --> 00:30:49.155]  Like, 98% of my moves are offensive.
[00:30:49.155 --> 00:30:50.076]  And that's my strategy.
[00:30:50.076 --> 00:30:52.697]  I mean, I'll tell you my strategy.
[00:30:52.697 --> 00:30:56.039]  You can ask people that I play, and I'm pretty good.
[00:30:56.039 --> 00:30:58.300]  Take everything, leave nothing.
[00:30:59.121 --> 00:31:02.762]  And they get pissed because at the end of the match, it's like basically all they have left is a king and a pawn.
[00:31:02.762 --> 00:31:06.103]  And so we're just like, just wasting time going around the board.
[00:31:06.103 --> 00:31:09.364]  But I always get them in the end.
[00:31:09.364 --> 00:31:13.566]  But I think Trump's strategy right now is very defensive.
[00:31:13.566 --> 00:31:15.286]  He's barely going on the offensive at all.
[00:31:15.286 --> 00:31:21.808]  Meanwhile, the globalist chess pieces are all being moved into offensive striking positions.
[00:31:21.808 --> 00:31:26.790]  So is that a good thing to let them strike to show the world who they really are?
[00:31:27.984 --> 00:31:33.107]  I think not, because at this point, if you don't realize who they are, then there's no hope for you.
[00:31:33.107 --> 00:31:37.290]  You've probably already bought in.
[00:31:37.290 --> 00:31:38.971]  But what are they doing right now?
[00:31:38.971 --> 00:31:44.095]  Okay, first they say you have to stay inside, there's a deadly virus going around.
[00:31:44.095 --> 00:31:45.315]  They fake the pandemic.
[00:31:45.315 --> 00:31:48.077]  Well, okay, the fake pandemic's pretty much been fully exposed.
[00:31:48.077 --> 00:31:50.599]  They still buy into it because they know it's their own propaganda.
[00:31:53.038 --> 00:31:56.699]  And really, that's why I get so upset when I go out and I see a mask on somebody's face.
[00:31:56.699 --> 00:31:59.100]  That's like the flag of the globalists.
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:03.042]  That's like people flying the flag of globalism and communism right in my face.
[00:32:03.042 --> 00:32:03.842]  Pisses me off.
[00:32:03.842 --> 00:32:06.903]  I don't want to see these damn commies out here.
[00:32:06.903 --> 00:32:10.245]  Because that's what it is.
[00:32:10.245 --> 00:32:13.246]  The mask is now the flag of communism.
[00:32:13.246 --> 00:32:14.506]  That's really all it is.
[00:32:14.506 --> 00:32:15.547]  They know it.
[00:32:15.547 --> 00:32:18.068]  They know they're not going to catch a deadly virus.
[00:32:18.068 --> 00:32:20.308]  But they know... See, because they're all LARPing.
[00:32:20.308 --> 00:32:21.409]  And it's all to get Trump.
[00:32:22.059 --> 00:32:26.823]  And they figure, oh, but if I just go along with the fake pandemic, then I'll get Trump.
[00:32:26.823 --> 00:32:33.149]  It's kind of like now the Democrats walk out there in their new fashionable African weave scarfs.
[00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:34.149]  What do you really call that?
[00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:35.671]  Can somebody tell me the official name for that?
[00:32:35.671 --> 00:32:39.114]  I'm sure there's an official name for that design from Africa.
[00:32:39.114 --> 00:32:42.396]  Very beautiful design from Africa.
[00:32:42.396 --> 00:32:45.479]  All of these congressmen are Americans.
[00:32:45.479 --> 00:32:48.021]  George Floyd is an American.
[00:32:48.021 --> 00:32:49.803]  I doubt George Floyd had ever even been to Africa.
[00:32:51.274 --> 00:32:57.342]  I wonder if George Floyd could point to the countries in Africa out on a map.
[00:32:57.342 --> 00:32:59.184]  But see, now it's about Africa.
[00:32:59.184 --> 00:33:00.485]  Oh!
[00:33:00.485 --> 00:33:08.736]  Virtue signaling now for black people by wearing African scarves and face masks.
[00:33:11.929 --> 00:33:13.550]  Really makes a lot of sense, doesn't it?
[00:33:13.550 --> 00:33:17.852]  It's all about taking their virtue signaling to the next level, because see, none of it's working.
[00:33:17.852 --> 00:33:18.972]  None of it's sticking.
[00:33:18.972 --> 00:33:20.593]  It's having a reverse effect.
[00:33:20.593 --> 00:33:22.634]  They don't care.
[00:33:22.634 --> 00:33:24.075]  That's why they wear the mask.
[00:33:24.075 --> 00:33:31.018]  That's why they wear the African flags, because it's all about flying their flag in your face as if you've been defeated.
[00:33:31.018 --> 00:33:35.860]  Wearing the mask out, telling you you can't have a full open business.
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:39.242]  That's their symbol of victory over you.
[00:33:41.516 --> 00:33:45.897]  That's their symbol of conquering America.
[00:33:45.897 --> 00:33:47.117]  That's why I can't even deal with it.
[00:33:47.117 --> 00:33:48.237]  I don't even wanna leave my house.
[00:33:48.237 --> 00:33:49.357]  I don't even wanna go to dinner.
[00:33:49.357 --> 00:33:50.938]  I don't even wanna go to the grocery store.
[00:33:50.938 --> 00:33:52.278]  I don't even wanna go to a bar.
[00:33:52.278 --> 00:33:55.699]  I can't stand it.
[00:33:55.699 --> 00:34:06.280]  Because I know these people are so committed to their hatred of me, that they pretend to care about black lives, and they pretend like there's a pandemic going along.
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.001]  And I know it's all fake, and they know it's all fake!
[00:34:09.693 --> 00:34:11.715]  And they know I know it's all fake!
[00:34:11.715 --> 00:34:13.937]  And they know I know that they know it's all fake!
[00:34:13.937 --> 00:34:19.501]  So they wear the mask as a big fat middle finger to us Americans.
[00:34:19.501 --> 00:34:24.806]  They wear the mask as a big fat communist flag of victory that they have conquered you!
[00:34:24.806 --> 00:34:26.347]  And conquered this country!
[00:34:26.347 --> 00:34:28.949]  And then they show you the videos of the police kneeling!
[00:34:28.949 --> 00:34:31.831]  They show you the videos of the National Guard kneeling!
[00:34:31.831 --> 00:34:34.814]  They show you the people washing the feet of black people!
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:46.085]  And then I'm sitting here like, wait a second, I'm looking at all the footage from all these BLM protests from the weekend, it's like 90% honkies!
[00:34:46.085 --> 00:34:50.186]  It's all white people!
[00:34:50.186 --> 00:34:56.009]  There's some video, or it was a picture, I can't remember, some girl is going to, I think the Mall of America or somewhere?
[00:34:56.009 --> 00:34:59.511]  Where there's a Black Lives Matter protest and they're all laying on the ground.
[00:35:00.523 --> 00:35:04.746]  And this blonde girl walks by and she's just laughing at them.
[00:35:04.746 --> 00:35:05.806]  Just laughing at them.
[00:35:05.806 --> 00:35:07.507]  Because these people are clowns!
[00:35:07.507 --> 00:35:10.949]  You look like a jackass!
[00:35:10.949 --> 00:35:19.094]  But so she walks by just laughing at them and you can see people look up at her and they raise their brow like, oh my gosh!
[00:35:19.094 --> 00:35:22.456]  You don't care about our protest?
[00:35:22.456 --> 00:35:25.238]  You aren't even going to acknowledge black lives?
[00:35:31.363 --> 00:35:39.746]  See, and then the left says, we need to hear from people of color.
[00:35:39.746 --> 00:35:43.068]  We need to hear from black people.
[00:35:43.068 --> 00:35:47.169]  And so then a black conservative steps up and says, hey, did you see the FBI crime?
[00:35:47.169 --> 00:35:48.110]  Shut up!
[00:35:48.110 --> 00:35:51.731]  You are a race traitor and a white supremacist and a bigot!
[00:35:51.731 --> 00:35:52.852]  Shut up!
[00:35:52.852 --> 00:35:56.133]  You shut up now!
[00:35:56.133 --> 00:35:57.754]  And the black conservative just says, oh, OK.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.121]  You're not black.
[00:36:01.121 --> 00:36:02.421]  You're not going to vote for Biden.
[00:36:02.421 --> 00:36:04.823]  He just wrote the crime bill.
[00:36:04.823 --> 00:36:07.704]  He just referred to black children as cockroaches.
[00:36:07.704 --> 00:36:13.907]  Hey, come on now.
[00:36:13.907 --> 00:36:15.788]  Come on now.
[00:36:15.788 --> 00:36:19.010]  Oh, by the way, you know what?
[00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:25.674]  I don't even want to show you, but, but there's just nudes that are going around of a de Blasio's daughter.
[00:36:25.674 --> 00:36:26.074]  And, um,
[00:36:27.509 --> 00:36:34.233]  Well, I won't get into all the details, but she's got a nice, she's got a nice tattoo that says F-Capitalism on her leg.
[00:36:34.233 --> 00:36:36.895]  So, you know, you know, de Blasio raised her right.
[00:36:36.895 --> 00:36:41.817]  She walked around dressed like a devil, engaging in terrorist activity.
[00:36:41.817 --> 00:36:42.358]  Hey!
[00:36:43.459 --> 00:36:48.422]  And then de Blasio says, well, the police need to stand down and not act with force.
[00:36:48.422 --> 00:36:51.904]  And the police are like, hey, you know, they're looting and burning and rioting right now.
[00:36:51.904 --> 00:36:54.485]  And de Blasio says, well, you know, you're just gonna have to let them do it.
[00:36:54.485 --> 00:36:56.246]  And then they arrest his daughter.
[00:36:56.246 --> 00:36:57.567]  And then it all makes sense.
[00:36:57.567 --> 00:37:01.770]  Oh, the Democrats don't want police because their children are out rioting.
[00:37:01.770 --> 00:37:05.312]  Oh, isn't that nice?
[00:37:05.312 --> 00:37:07.773]  Here's what I don't understand.
[00:37:07.773 --> 00:37:12.496]  If I got caught rioting by my parents, I would have gotten my ass whooped.
[00:37:15.745 --> 00:37:19.688]  I don't care how old I was.
[00:37:19.688 --> 00:37:22.690]  But like, oh, I don't know how old DeBlasio's daughter is.
[00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:24.932]  She's gotta be probably out of high school.
[00:37:24.932 --> 00:37:26.533]  It's like, oh, oh, you know what?
[00:37:26.533 --> 00:37:30.916]  Yeah, just... It doesn't matter that I'm the mayor of New York City.
[00:37:30.916 --> 00:37:33.198]  Go out and burn it to the ground, babe.
[00:37:33.198 --> 00:37:34.979]  It's all good.
[00:37:34.979 --> 00:37:38.722]  Sure, have a fans-only account for Antifa members.
[00:37:38.722 --> 00:37:42.465]  Yeah, screw capitalism!
[00:37:42.465 --> 00:37:43.866]  Yeah, you know what?
[00:37:43.866 --> 00:37:44.847]  Oh yeah, that's right, because, uh...
[00:37:47.177 --> 00:37:49.979]  De Blasio paid the police to help his daughter move.
[00:37:49.979 --> 00:37:50.719]  Did you hear about that?
[00:37:50.719 --> 00:38:00.105]  Because that's how public, you know, servants are supposed to be, you know, moving the neighbor's daughter, because I'm sure he couldn't afford it himself.
[00:38:00.105 --> 00:38:05.107]  But you see, it's all about how these people are so depraved spiritually, mentally.
[00:38:05.107 --> 00:38:09.130]  Now you have tranny terrorists, which it's all a joke.
[00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:09.550]  I mean, look.
[00:38:13.467 --> 00:38:20.252]  Some guys want to be girls, and then some guys want to pretend to be girls so they can get away with crime.
[00:38:20.252 --> 00:38:31.661]  So here's your tranny terrorist from Portland, who's actually not from Portland, actually from Ohio, but hey, you know, lives in the dump of Portland now.
[00:38:31.661 --> 00:38:34.263]  Wants to be around his own.
[00:38:34.263 --> 00:38:36.024]  Oh, but this is actually a woman.
[00:38:36.024 --> 00:38:39.027]  Doesn't matter that there's five o'clock shadow and, you know, clearly a man.
[00:38:39.027 --> 00:38:43.050]  It's, that's, that's Amelia Shamrowitz.
[00:38:45.404 --> 00:38:47.606]  Now do you think Shamrowitz was the original name here?
[00:38:47.606 --> 00:38:48.447]  I wonder.
[00:38:48.447 --> 00:38:55.192]  Or I wonder if they just don't throw sham in there just to sham you, because they know the whole thing's a sham.
[00:38:55.192 --> 00:39:00.397]  But there's your old tranny terrorist from Portland.
[00:39:00.397 --> 00:39:02.779]  Arson, one.
[00:39:02.779 --> 00:39:04.540]  Released on zero dollar bail.
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:06.802]  Crime, mischief, one.
[00:39:06.802 --> 00:39:09.484]  Class C felony, released, zero dollar bail.
[00:39:09.484 --> 00:39:12.447]  Riot charge, C class felony, released, zero dollar bail.
[00:39:15.316 --> 00:39:17.778]  Portland, Oregon.
[00:39:17.778 --> 00:39:19.879]  Portlandia.
[00:39:19.879 --> 00:39:23.382]  Clown world.
[00:39:23.382 --> 00:39:28.746]  So, why is all of this happening, folks?
[00:39:28.746 --> 00:39:35.451]  Because as the New York headline put it, New York Post, the lying about Donald Trump is now completely out of control.
[00:39:35.451 --> 00:39:41.696]  And so, the Democrat riot mob that's been activated by the mainstream media
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:54.108]  And the trained Democrat militants that we have exposed through Project Veritas have all been activated and it's all because Trump is president and they want him out.

[00:40:53.095 --> 00:40:54.276]  InfoWarStore.com
[00:41:00.976 --> 00:41:09.212]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax, and now it's the
[00:41:10.945 --> 00:41:12.786]  Race riot hoax of 2020.
[00:41:12.786 --> 00:41:16.149]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next.
[00:41:16.149 --> 00:41:22.413]  Well, I can tell you it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war.
[00:41:22.413 --> 00:41:28.236]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[00:41:28.236 --> 00:41:30.698]  The globalists are attacking on every front.
[00:41:30.698 --> 00:41:31.539]  That's why now
[00:41:32.159 --> 00:41:42.142]  More than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor InfoWars off the air because they knew when they launched this whole situation that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air.
[00:41:42.142 --> 00:41:46.324]  But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[00:41:46.324 --> 00:41:50.565]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever.
[00:41:50.565 --> 00:41:52.926]  InfoWars.com Live!
[00:41:56.283 --> 00:42:06.191]  What InfoWars has been able to do, thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth, has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[00:42:06.191 --> 00:42:10.054]  This is the battle for the future of humanity.
[00:42:10.054 --> 00:42:16.659]  And now, open world government is being established with an endgame to depopulate the planet.
[00:42:17.379 --> 00:42:22.782]  Now, the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized.
[00:42:22.782 --> 00:42:25.383]  You must decide which side you're on.
[00:42:25.383 --> 00:42:33.648]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm Syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery, destruction, and finally, death.
[00:42:33.648 --> 00:42:38.871]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[00:42:38.871 --> 00:42:40.432]  The delusions must end now.
[00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:46.794]  InfoWars was correct about it all, and we have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[00:42:46.794 --> 00:42:50.715]  Most people that are aware of the New World Order decide to join it out of fear.
[00:42:50.715 --> 00:42:52.056]  They are truly fools.
[00:42:52.056 --> 00:42:54.437]  We must fight this, or lose our souls.
[00:42:55.543 --> 00:43:03.848]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism and so populist movements are throwing the globalists out of their countries.
[00:43:03.848 --> 00:43:14.775]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services.
[00:43:15.555 --> 00:43:23.980]  This is an attempt to have society collapse, and the globalists, as they've done in the third world, will come in and pick up the pieces.
[00:43:23.980 --> 00:43:30.603]  We must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU, openly saying, defund the police.
[00:43:30.603 --> 00:43:31.904]  The police have a lot of problems.
[00:43:31.904 --> 00:43:33.265]  We all have a lot of problems.
[00:43:33.265 --> 00:43:36.026]  But this is our government and our local constabulary.
[00:43:36.026 --> 00:43:38.108]  And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country,
[00:43:38.948 --> 00:43:42.991]  They're going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[00:43:42.991 --> 00:43:46.754]  The globalists believe communist China is the model of the world.
[00:43:46.754 --> 00:43:48.936]  And they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[00:43:48.936 --> 00:43:53.399]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed.
[00:43:53.399 --> 00:43:59.284]  Infowars.com!
[00:43:59.284 --> 00:44:01.926]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:15.173]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[00:44:15.173 --> 00:44:18.654]  And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[00:44:18.654 --> 00:44:30.958]  You know, I've got this video of a black thug knocking out an elderly black gentleman at the subway in New York because he said he liked Trump.
[00:44:30.958 --> 00:44:32.339]  Heroic of him to do so.
[00:44:34.363 --> 00:44:35.604]  Because Black Lives Matter.
[00:44:35.604 --> 00:44:39.627]  I mean, this guy can barely walk, and so, you know, he says, hey, I like America, I like Trump.
[00:44:39.627 --> 00:44:41.589]  And so, folks, this is a technique, too.
[00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:44.251]  I mean, to me, this is a premeditated murder attempt.
[00:44:44.251 --> 00:44:48.554]  Because you tap the guy on the back, get him to turn around, and then you slug him with your fist.
[00:44:48.554 --> 00:44:55.619]  And if this guy's ever trained in a boxing gym, a good lawyer will get you to say that those fists are a deadly weapon.
[00:44:55.619 --> 00:44:56.720]  I've seen this before.
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:00.023]  So... But, you know, Black Lives Matter.
[00:45:00.023 --> 00:45:01.464]  Knock out a black guy if he likes Trump.
[00:45:03.072 --> 00:45:05.654]  And by the way, all these Democrats are learning the hard way.
[00:45:05.654 --> 00:45:08.595]  Remember the fake black guy, Sean King?
[00:45:08.595 --> 00:45:11.837]  Who's like, hey, you know, I just, I'm Sean King.
[00:45:11.837 --> 00:45:15.019]  I pretend to be black, but I pretend to read too.
[00:45:15.019 --> 00:45:24.585]  And I just discovered that all the cities where the violent crime on black people by police, it's all happening in Democrat cities.
[00:45:24.585 --> 00:45:25.506]  What is going on?
[00:45:25.506 --> 00:45:26.647]  We can't vote these people in.
[00:45:26.647 --> 00:45:30.329]  It's like, whoa, wow, hey.
[00:45:30.329 --> 00:45:31.850]  Did you know the sun rises too?
[00:45:33.368 --> 00:45:34.609]  On the East?
[00:45:34.609 --> 00:45:37.491]  Wow.
[00:45:37.491 --> 00:45:41.694]  But see, then de Blasio gives out a speech during a Black Lives Matter protest.
[00:45:41.694 --> 00:45:44.316]  He gets booed and jeered and kicked out.
[00:45:44.316 --> 00:45:48.839]  And now here's... I mean, this guy, this guy's almost unbelievable.
[00:45:48.839 --> 00:45:50.821]  How this guy gets into office is beyond me.
[00:45:50.821 --> 00:45:55.364]  This is the biggest cuck, low-energy loser I've ever seen.
[00:45:55.364 --> 00:45:58.026]  This Mayor Frey, Jacob Frey.
[00:45:58.026 --> 00:45:59.487]  You wouldn't believe this guy was mayor.
[00:45:59.487 --> 00:46:00.488]  You wouldn't even believe it.
[00:46:02.392 --> 00:46:13.335]  So here he is at a BLM protest in Minneapolis, and he said he didn't want to defund police, so look what happens to him.
[00:46:13.335 --> 00:46:14.656]  Go home, Jacob!
[00:46:14.656 --> 00:46:15.816]  Go home!
[00:46:15.816 --> 00:46:17.096]  Go home, Jacob!
[00:46:17.096 --> 00:46:18.017]  Go home, Jacob!
[00:46:18.017 --> 00:46:18.457]  Go home!
[00:46:18.457 --> 00:46:22.138]  I mean, part of me gives credit to the guy.
[00:46:22.138 --> 00:46:27.899]  I mean, even if you're like a total loser, low-energy, if that's who you really are, then okay.
[00:46:27.899 --> 00:46:29.620]  I mean, at least you're who you are.
[00:46:30.831 --> 00:46:34.272]  I mean, he's out there with no security, nothing.
[00:46:34.272 --> 00:46:39.374]  He's out there with the protests, because that's really who he is, just a left-wing activist, somehow got into office.
[00:46:39.374 --> 00:46:44.035]  And he really cares, so, you know, he's a true bleeding heart over here.
[00:46:44.035 --> 00:46:50.197]  Comes up, no security, just like, hey, I'm with you, you know, I'm a bad honky and everything, you know, get whitey, that's all good.
[00:46:50.197 --> 00:46:51.677]  They say, but do you want to defund police?
[00:46:51.677 --> 00:47:00.320]  And it's like, in fact, I bet if you looked at the demographics, I would almost bet the House, if you looked at the demographics per capita,
[00:47:01.784 --> 00:47:07.045]  More black people are police than white people.
[00:47:07.045 --> 00:47:26.549]  I bet if you looked per capita, the percentage of a population based on demographics, I would bet you that the percentage of blacks versus whites going into the police force, I bet you black people will be higher than white people.
[00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:27.909]  If not, if not even.
[00:47:31.141 --> 00:47:39.327]  And so maybe, maybe Jacob Frey actually looked into it and he said, hmm, most of my police force is actually minorities and not white guys.
[00:47:39.327 --> 00:47:43.590]  So maybe we shouldn't defund the police and cost those people their livelihoods.
[00:47:43.590 --> 00:47:45.071]  So he says, yeah, I don't want to defund the police.
[00:47:45.071 --> 00:47:48.613]  And then the Democrat mob, boo, go home, Jacob, you suck.
[00:47:48.613 --> 00:47:51.896]  And now he's probably gonna get voted out of office.
[00:47:51.896 --> 00:47:58.981]  You don't cater to the mob, especially a brainwashed mob by the media.
[00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:05.751]  Because when you stand for nothing, you'll fall for anything.
[00:48:05.751 --> 00:48:07.372]  And that's really what this is about.
[00:48:07.372 --> 00:48:10.933]  For example, roll the b-roll from an L.A.
[00:48:10.933 --> 00:48:12.193]  protest over this weekend.
[00:48:12.193 --> 00:48:25.778]  Now keep in mind, in Los Angeles, in Hollywood, in fact, in Los Angeles, as of 2016, there have been hundreds of arrests of pedophiles and sex traffickers.
[00:48:27.208 --> 00:48:27.948]  No protest.
[00:48:27.948 --> 00:48:28.808]  Nobody cares.
[00:48:28.808 --> 00:48:31.629]  Kids rescued from cages.
[00:48:31.629 --> 00:48:46.634]  Remember that whole kids in cages fake narrative about Trump that was actually Obama and was really just a detention center that law was written by Democrats in the 70s that you have to separate kids from going to DHS instead of
[00:48:47.708 --> 00:48:49.369]  Do they go to DPS?
[00:48:49.369 --> 00:48:50.410]  No, no, no, none of that matters.
[00:48:50.410 --> 00:49:05.339]  So they run the fake kids in cages thing when it's fake, but when there's actual kids in cages that are being sex trafficked that the Trump administration is going after and that LA cops actually find, nobody bats an eye and the media doesn't cover it.
[00:49:05.339 --> 00:49:14.265]  And then when George Floyd, his face gets broadcast over media for three straight weeks, then in LA they get out and protest.
[00:49:17.756 --> 00:49:23.262]  You know, I got an Amber Alert for a seven-month-old black baby today.
[00:49:23.262 --> 00:49:24.784]  Anybody else get that?
[00:49:24.784 --> 00:49:25.865]  Yeah, the crew's nodding their heads.
[00:49:25.865 --> 00:49:29.610]  Does that black life matter?
[00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:31.592]  Anybody care about that child kidnapping?
[00:49:31.592 --> 00:49:35.216]  Wonder what's gonna happen to that... ...baby.
[00:49:40.273 --> 00:49:45.436]  No, no, no, no protests, no rallies, no... I mean, imagine if that entire group of L.A.
[00:49:45.436 --> 00:49:50.739]  bums, who I guess never work, I guess they don't have a job now, imagine if that entire group of L.A.
[00:49:50.739 --> 00:49:57.782]  bums, to the tune of tens and thousands, actually wanted to stop child sex trafficking.
[00:49:57.782 --> 00:50:09.549]  Well, they wouldn't want to go through the Amber Alert system, which is run by formerly Hillary Clinton acolyte, Laura Silsby, caught at the border
[00:50:10.905 --> 00:50:15.548]  By my estimation, trafficking children for sex.
[00:50:15.548 --> 00:50:19.751]  Oh no, she just happened to find these poor Haitian kids over here at the border.
[00:50:19.751 --> 00:50:24.614]  She just ran into a group of Haitian kids and she was trying to bring them across the border to safety.
[00:50:24.614 --> 00:50:26.295]  Oh yeah.
[00:50:26.295 --> 00:50:28.157]  Oh yeah, she's a hero.
[00:50:28.157 --> 00:50:31.479]  And so now she's in charge of the Amber Alert system.
[00:50:31.479 --> 00:50:36.562]  That is child procurer number uno.
[00:50:36.562 --> 00:50:37.683]  Numero one.
[00:50:37.683 --> 00:50:40.185]  Boy, I'm telling you.
[00:50:41.243 --> 00:50:42.724]  I can't even get to my point.
[00:50:42.724 --> 00:50:44.044]  I'm so sickened.
[00:50:44.044 --> 00:50:51.428]  You know, and it's the same thing, because we've got this protest now, Expose Bill Gates Day of Action coming up.
[00:50:51.428 --> 00:50:56.110]  We've got all these different, you know, like PedoGate 2020 Part 1 and Part 2.
[00:50:56.110 --> 00:50:57.531]  Again, it's still happening over the weekend.
[00:50:57.531 --> 00:50:59.072]  Friends and family, like, you weren't crazy.
[00:50:59.072 --> 00:51:00.152]  You were right.
[00:51:00.152 --> 00:51:01.613]  I saw the PeaceGate documentary.
[00:51:01.613 --> 00:51:02.854]  I saw a PedoGate documentary.
[00:51:02.854 --> 00:51:03.494]  I saw this.
[00:51:03.494 --> 00:51:04.234]  I looked at it.
[00:51:04.234 --> 00:51:05.855]  Oh my gosh, you were right.
[00:51:05.855 --> 00:51:06.456]  This is crazy.
[00:51:06.456 --> 00:51:07.836]  The Democrats trying to kill the country.
[00:51:07.836 --> 00:51:08.617]  What is going on?
[00:51:08.617 --> 00:51:09.077]  What should I do?
[00:51:11.089 --> 00:51:24.501]  So, America is awakening to this, but the more we awaken and fight back, the more desperate the Democrat, Globalist, Chinese Communists get, and the closer we get to their final plan of action, which is not going to be pretty.
[00:51:25.828 --> 00:51:32.630]  But I can't even get to my point, because it's like, oh yeah, we forget about the fact that these people are engaged in child procurement and sex trafficking.
[00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:38.733]  It's like, oh yeah, we forget about the Hollywood involvement in that, and the Democrat involvement in that, and the Republicans too.
[00:51:38.733 --> 00:51:42.294]  I mean, let's be perfectly clear, let's not forget about Dennis Hastert.
[00:51:42.294 --> 00:51:47.776]  You know, Ted Gunderson exposed it all over a decade ago, and you know, eh, meh.
[00:51:47.776 --> 00:51:52.858]  Yeah, I didn't hear it on CNN, so I don't need to march or anything, but go to the B-roll back to the 10,000 L.A.
[00:51:52.858 --> 00:51:52.978]  bums.
[00:51:55.623 --> 00:51:58.564]  Because where's COVID?
[00:51:58.564 --> 00:52:01.585]  Where is COVID?
[00:52:01.585 --> 00:52:07.568]  I'm not allowed to go to the store without a mask, even though I don't wear the mask anyway.
[00:52:07.568 --> 00:52:11.529]  I'm hypoxia sensitive, very serious.
[00:52:11.529 --> 00:52:19.473]  But there's 10,000 LA bums, no social distance, no mask, and a total spread of COVID, right?
[00:52:19.473 --> 00:52:20.753]  Right?
[00:52:20.753 --> 00:52:22.674]  Right?
[00:52:22.674 --> 00:52:23.094]  Wrong.
[00:52:25.114 --> 00:52:28.295]  Fake pandemic.
[00:52:28.295 --> 00:52:33.577]  I mean, seriously, if you had to guess, all right, what are they going to do next?
[00:52:33.577 --> 00:52:35.417]  Who would have guessed fake pandemic?
[00:52:35.417 --> 00:52:38.158]  I mean, who would have guessed faking a pandemic?
[00:52:38.158 --> 00:52:38.898]  And who knows?
[00:52:38.898 --> 00:52:47.401]  They may have really released a bioweapon that they thought would ultimately be deadly and it just mutated and God's creation of human won again.
[00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:49.871]  Could be the case.
[00:52:49.871 --> 00:52:51.132]  So they'll probably release another one.
[00:52:51.132 --> 00:52:53.533]  That's why Bill Gates says they'll be, you know, round two.
[00:52:53.533 --> 00:52:55.635]  And they'll just say it's COVID, but it'll be something else.
[00:52:55.635 --> 00:52:59.997]  And they may never even tell you what it is.
[00:52:59.997 --> 00:53:04.140]  But are they going to blame the protesters?
[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:05.621]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:53:05.621 --> 00:53:07.322]  They're going to blame you.
[00:53:07.322 --> 00:53:11.525]  And they're going to say it was an act of racism.
[00:53:11.525 --> 00:53:12.725]  Of course they are.
[00:53:12.725 --> 00:53:13.546]  That's what they do best.
[00:53:16.854 --> 00:53:18.656]  So what is the point of all this?
[00:53:18.656 --> 00:53:23.502]  Well, the point is that we need to realize how dangerous things are.
[00:53:23.502 --> 00:53:31.071]  We need to realize that Democrats have activated their militant wing, which is disguised as Antifa, which is actually Antifa.
[00:53:31.071 --> 00:53:33.935]  There were three Antifa members arrested in Austin this weekend.
[00:53:34.355 --> 00:53:37.556]  But Antifa, it's just another Soros front group, folks.
[00:53:37.556 --> 00:53:39.557]  There's FBI agents.
[00:53:39.557 --> 00:53:40.757]  There's CIA agents.
[00:53:40.757 --> 00:53:42.177]  John Brennan is running the whole thing.
[00:53:42.177 --> 00:53:45.198]  Barack Obama is behind the scenes pulling the strings.
[00:53:45.198 --> 00:53:47.479]  The mainstream media is in on the whole thing.
[00:53:47.479 --> 00:53:48.839]  They faked the pandemic.
[00:53:48.839 --> 00:53:50.380]  They're faking protests now.
[00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:51.680]  It's all LARPing, man.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:53.481]  It's all fake.
[00:53:53.481 --> 00:53:54.061]  It's all fake.
[00:53:56.172 --> 00:53:57.532]  What happened to COVID-19?
[00:53:57.532 --> 00:54:01.514]  Well, it is only real when we want to shut the economy down.
[00:54:01.514 --> 00:54:04.995]  It's only real when we want to blame Trump for starting a pandemic.
[00:54:04.995 --> 00:54:08.636]  It's only real when we want to use it to power grab.
[00:54:08.636 --> 00:54:15.019]  When 10,000 brainwashed LA bums go out on the street to protest for Black Lives Matter, then there is no COVID-19.
[00:54:16.704 --> 00:54:20.925]  And you know, your business needs to close at 9 o'clock because COVID comes out at 9.
[00:54:20.925 --> 00:54:23.185]  So you can't go to the gym past 9.
[00:54:23.185 --> 00:54:25.506]  And you can't go get groceries past 9.
[00:54:25.506 --> 00:54:29.506]  And if you have a restaurant, you can only have 25% capacity because of the COVID.
[00:54:29.506 --> 00:54:34.347]  You know, it can read percentages and know how much, if it should infect or not.
[00:54:34.347 --> 00:54:37.448]  Oh, but go out and riot, and loot, and protest, and shut down the police too.
[00:54:37.448 --> 00:54:39.468]  And turn your guns in as well.
[00:54:39.468 --> 00:54:41.408]  And that's called the Democrat clown world.
[00:54:41.408 --> 00:54:42.549]  And that's what we're up against, folks.
[00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:44.709]  And they're about to do something more dangerous than we could even imagine.
[00:54:45.819 --> 00:54:54.872]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chi-coms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[00:54:54.872 --> 00:54:58.837]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world.
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:06.046]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going to be.
[00:55:06.046 --> 00:55:12.032]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy.
[00:55:12.032 --> 00:55:20.479]  That's why we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[00:55:21.340 --> 00:55:23.202]  They've admitted all of this.
[00:55:23.202 --> 00:55:30.828]  So remember, how does Infowars continue years and decades in many cases to be able to predict things before they happen?
[00:55:30.828 --> 00:55:35.032]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan.
[00:55:35.032 --> 00:55:36.233]  And yes, it's dystopic.
[00:55:36.233 --> 00:55:37.514]  And yes, it's scary.
[00:55:37.514 --> 00:55:41.717]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[00:55:41.717 --> 00:55:44.720]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[00:55:46.676 --> 00:56:04.867]  I've been fighting the globalists for 26 years and the evil side of me is just so tired of waiting and I'm so ready for physical war that I'm kind of happy about how bad things have gotten because all the delusional folks that don't stand up for the unborn babies that go along with the New World Order, you're about to find out just how sick stuff is.
[00:56:04.867 --> 00:56:05.688]  But you know what?
[00:56:05.688 --> 00:56:07.229]  The average person is still asleep.
[00:56:07.229 --> 00:56:09.030]  They don't deserve what's happening to them.
[00:56:09.030 --> 00:56:10.071]  So I'm actually sick
[00:56:10.851 --> 00:56:13.894]  About what's unfolding right now, and I just want to turn things around.
[00:56:13.894 --> 00:56:14.894]  But you know what?
[00:56:14.894 --> 00:56:16.956]  I can't do that without you.
[00:56:16.956 --> 00:56:18.317]  I can't get out of this mess.
[00:56:18.317 --> 00:56:22.300]  I can't get out of this stranglehold I'm in, unless you decide to get out of it as well.
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:23.221]  We're all in this together.
[00:56:23.221 --> 00:56:31.828]  And so if you just realize how important you are, when you just tell people about the local radio stations you're listening to, local TV stations, when you just spread the word about Infowars.com forward slash show,
[00:56:32.268 --> 00:56:35.830]  When you just buy the products at MFortworthStore.com, it changes the world.
[00:56:35.830 --> 00:56:38.012]  Right now, we've got a special that's about to end.
[00:56:38.012 --> 00:56:41.174]  60% off across the board.
[00:56:41.174 --> 00:56:44.977]  Flash sale that funds the MFortworth and gets you great products you need at the same time.
[00:56:44.977 --> 00:56:48.679]  MFortworthStore.com.
[00:56:48.679 --> 00:56:51.321]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:56:59.404 --> 00:57:03.405]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:57:03.405 --> 00:57:11.847]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:57:11.847 --> 00:57:15.007]  It sounds extreme, but here's the truth, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:15.007 --> 00:57:26.190]  There is a criminal cabal we refer to as the globalists, but they operate under many different hats, like the Democrat Party, the Chinese Communists, and so on.
[00:57:27.366 --> 00:57:29.808]  And this is their ultimate goal.
[00:57:29.808 --> 00:57:53.943]  To end nation states and bring in a one world government with centralized power which is really just run by the corporations and their heads with an AI smart grid policing the world population 24-7 that you must comply with or you won't be allowed to shop or sell or
[00:57:55.393 --> 00:58:00.917]  Go out and watch a musical or a movie or a ball game.
[00:58:00.917 --> 00:58:03.799]  That's where this all is going.
[00:58:03.799 --> 00:58:11.664]  And America is the crown jewel of freedom and sovereignty in the world.
[00:58:11.664 --> 00:58:16.307]  And so you must defeat America before you can roll that plan out.
[00:58:16.307 --> 00:58:17.368]  America's not perfect.
[00:58:17.368 --> 00:58:19.610]  We've had a lot of problems as a nation.
[00:58:19.610 --> 00:58:21.091]  Still to this day, we need to figure out.
[00:58:23.058 --> 00:58:49.985]  Infowars has been at the cutting edge of exposing a lot of this, but at the end of the day, the reason why America is necessary is because it is a sovereign nation, of sovereign people, a republic, that at its will, in its DNA, no matter what your skin color is, our ancestors fought tyranny, put it all on the line to defeat tyranny, realizing
[00:58:51.656 --> 00:58:57.157]  What that meant for our ancestors.
[00:58:57.157 --> 00:59:02.098]  And so now that the left and the Democrats, everybody has made life invaluable with abortion and everything.
[00:59:02.098 --> 00:59:06.979]  Well, you just hate yourself, so you don't value life, so you don't care what you leave for the future.
[00:59:06.979 --> 00:59:10.260]  You are in misery, so you want company.
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:12.481]  This is very complex, but that's what this is all about.
[00:59:12.481 --> 00:59:13.561]  That's what people need to understand.
[00:59:15.416 --> 00:59:28.386]  Alex Jones is coming up next with Paul Joseph Watson, and they are going to be talking about what's going on in the UK now, where somehow George Floyd's protests are in the UK, and so now they're tearing down statues in the UK.
[00:59:28.386 --> 00:59:30.807]  Again, folks, these are just media mobs.
[00:59:30.807 --> 00:59:33.129]  These are just media mobs.
[00:59:33.129 --> 00:59:37.272]  The brainwashed puppets of the mainstream media and George Soros.
[00:59:37.272 --> 00:59:38.213]  That's all they are.
[00:59:41.411 --> 00:59:42.872]  Are there some well-meaning people in there?
[00:59:42.872 --> 00:59:46.893]  Yes, but they've been duped as well, and I think they're starting to figure it out.
[00:59:46.893 --> 00:59:51.916]  So Paul Joseph Watson is coming up with Alex Jones to break all that down and more.
[00:59:51.916 --> 00:59:56.297]  And of course, the War Room that I host three hours a day, 3 to 6 p.m.
[00:59:56.297 --> 00:59:58.778]  Central.
[00:59:58.778 --> 00:59:59.959]  We'll be getting more into that.
[00:59:59.959 --> 01:00:04.521]  I've got other great guests that'll be joining me then as well, and I'm hoping I can take your phone calls.
[01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:06.162]  I don't know if Alex is gonna be taking phone calls today.
[01:00:06.162 --> 01:00:07.082]  I'm sure he's gonna want to.
[01:00:07.082 --> 01:00:09.043]  Gerald Cilenti coming up in the fourth hour.
[01:00:11.028 --> 01:00:17.494]  Uh, but I am going to be taking a lot of calls on the War Room today in between my guests.
[01:00:17.494 --> 01:00:27.044]  So, it's all possible with your support at InfoWareStore.com, and it's crazy to think what we've been able to do with this audience, us together.
[01:00:27.044 --> 01:00:28.285]  When I say we, that's all of us.
[01:00:28.285 --> 01:00:31.088]  That's you hearing this message, that's the crew, that's me in this chair.
[01:00:33.882 --> 01:00:36.243]  That's all the other great guests and hosts that we have.
[01:00:36.243 --> 01:00:40.123]  What we've been able to do in the face of this tyranny is really incredible.
[01:00:40.123 --> 01:00:41.324]  It really is.
[01:00:41.324 --> 01:00:53.027]  We are the new unwinnable war that we're fighting here just like the Founding Fathers did against the British Empire.
[01:00:53.027 --> 01:00:54.467]  Nobody thought they could win.
[01:00:54.467 --> 01:00:55.687]  It was impossible.
[01:00:55.687 --> 01:00:57.068]  That's what we're battling now.
[01:00:57.068 --> 01:00:58.288]  Except it's the globalist
[01:00:59.201 --> 01:01:01.083]  Incorporated Empire.
[01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:02.464]  Now, we don't take their money.
[01:01:02.464 --> 01:01:09.011]  You don't see big pharmaceutical ads or fast food ads or Hollywood ads or any of that.
[01:01:09.011 --> 01:01:10.312]  Nope, we don't take their money.
[01:01:10.312 --> 01:01:13.015]  That's why we're able to operate independently.
[01:01:13.015 --> 01:01:18.560]  That's why we're an American-made news organization.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:19.241]  Proud of it.
[01:01:19.241 --> 01:01:22.965]  Made in the USA, for the USA, by the USA.
[01:01:24.164 --> 01:01:26.565]  No foreign money coming in.
[01:01:26.565 --> 01:01:30.408]  No big ads telling us what we can or can't say.
[01:01:30.408 --> 01:01:32.449]  And we've beaten all of it.
[01:01:32.449 --> 01:01:34.190]  That's you, that's us, that's all of us.
[01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:35.991]  All of us have beaten it, folks.
[01:01:35.991 --> 01:01:41.074]  But we have to continue fighting, and your support at InfoWarsStore.com is essential.
[01:01:41.074 --> 01:01:44.636]  Last chance of the 60% off across-the-board flash sale.

[01:01:48.898 --> 01:01:49.899]  Thank you for your support.
[01:01:49.899 --> 01:01:52.140]  Alex Jones, Paul Joseph Watson, on the other side.
[01:01:54.898 --> 01:01:56.419]  I don't have to tell you things are bad.
[01:01:56.419 --> 01:01:57.379]  They're worse than bad.
[01:01:57.379 --> 01:01:58.240]  They're crazy.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:01.241]  That's a quote from the 1970s film, Network.
[01:02:01.241 --> 01:02:02.942]  Yeah, things are really, really bad right now.
[01:02:02.942 --> 01:02:04.302]  We're in global martial law.
[01:02:04.302 --> 01:02:09.004]  Bill and Melinda Gates, UN operations trying to bankrupt America with their lockdown and their race riots.
[01:02:09.004 --> 01:02:11.346]  But people are coming together in this beautiful time.
[01:02:11.346 --> 01:02:12.326]  But I'll be honest with you.
[01:02:12.566 --> 01:02:14.969]  I have decided to sell out of all the products in our warehouse.
[01:02:14.969 --> 01:02:15.950]  60% off.
[01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:17.732]  We haven't done that ever across the board.
[01:02:17.732 --> 01:02:20.696]  Because gut level, I realize that we're making or breaking.
[01:02:20.696 --> 01:02:28.524]  And so the only sure bet is to sell everything we've got to make sure, in case there's total breakdown of society in six months, we still have the funding to go more than six months into next year.
[01:02:29.045 --> 01:02:35.727]  Get your high quality products, your fish oil, your krill oil, your DNA force, your X2, your X3, your Real Red Pill Plus.

[01:02:43.909 --> 01:02:45.510]  We're in very important times.
[01:02:45.510 --> 01:02:49.331]  InfoWars needs funding and you need high quality products to take action.
[01:02:49.331 --> 01:02:53.212]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:02:55.785 --> 01:02:58.706]  This is an emergency transmission from deep in the heart of Texas, the U.S.
[01:02:58.706 --> 01:03:07.429]  resistance against a global corporate combine, empowered and funded by Communist China, allied with the big megabanks that set up Communist China in 1949.
[01:03:07.429 --> 01:03:09.930]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of U.S.
[01:03:09.930 --> 01:03:11.750]  telecommunications infrastructure.
[01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:13.651]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of Hollywood.
[01:03:13.911 --> 01:03:16.254]  The Communist Chinese have taken control of the main universities.
[01:03:16.254 --> 01:03:17.356]  This is all confirmed.
[01:03:17.356 --> 01:03:18.437]  This is not a drill.
[01:03:18.437 --> 01:03:22.723]  Big Tech in Silicon Valley is almost completely run by the Communist Chinese government.
[01:03:22.723 --> 01:03:24.246]  They've officially become state-run.
[01:03:24.246 --> 01:03:25.147]  Apple 100%.
[01:03:25.147 --> 01:03:30.755]  Google is now making the transition and announcing a merger and total worldwide censorship.
[01:03:31.215 --> 01:03:36.279]  They are now beta testing using me as the straw man, a demonized version of Alex Jones, to do that.
[01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:37.160]  This is happening.
[01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:45.186]  This is not like the other probes before that were meant to get you used to probes and censorship, thinking you would adapt to censorship by just putting up with it.
[01:03:45.186 --> 01:03:51.551]  Now this attack is thousands and thousands and thousands of times the magnitude of all previous attacks.
[01:03:51.551 --> 01:03:59.517]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation using adapt and overcome, subversion, paradigm manipulation.
[01:04:00.397 --> 01:04:04.218]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[01:04:04.218 --> 01:04:07.718]  We adapt to being pressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[01:04:07.718 --> 01:04:14.960]  Now when the megaton hits us of the total takeover, we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.980]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:23.201]  Total Internet of Things integration, global social score, complete command and control system.
[01:04:23.201 --> 01:04:25.882]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system.
[01:04:26.462 --> 01:04:39.226]  Attacking the United States with traitors inside the major security agencies, blocking Trump's resistance of the program, and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles of the Chi-Com slash Big Tech hanging combine emergency situation.
[01:04:39.226 --> 01:04:44.367]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[01:04:45.490 --> 01:04:54.232]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system of mathematical deception, where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[01:04:54.232 --> 01:04:59.493]  So they take what I've said, being sincere, build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[01:04:59.493 --> 01:05:04.614]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars, and so they make me a herder of children.
[01:05:04.614 --> 01:05:12.416]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[01:05:12.936 --> 01:05:20.123]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they've now used me as an archetype to serve them by being the main distraction.
[01:05:20.123 --> 01:05:25.708]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum and is being used against you.
[01:05:25.708 --> 01:05:30.313]  Only your full understanding of this TV will break you free from this paradigm.
[01:05:30.313 --> 01:05:32.655]  I have given you the transmission!
[01:05:32.655 --> 01:05:33.596]  Now break free!
[01:05:37.308 --> 01:05:46.599]  I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[01:05:46.599 --> 01:05:49.382]  Thomas Jefferson.
[01:05:49.382 --> 01:05:53.506]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:06:03.085 --> 01:06:26.104]  We are now into hour number two on this live, original, unfiltered, teleprompter-free, June 8th, Monday, global transmission, with one, four, seven out from the election, as the jaws of the deep state and the neocon leftist globalists, juggernauts, snap down hard on America's neck.
[01:06:29.033 --> 01:06:35.676]  Attempting to sever our populist president from the people and continue our plunge in the New World Order.
[01:06:35.676 --> 01:06:38.077]  Without further ado, we've got a lot to cover.
[01:06:38.077 --> 01:06:47.302]  Paul Joseph Watson joins us from Her Britannic Majesty's London, Albion, also known by George Orwell as Airstrip One.
[01:06:47.302 --> 01:06:55.686]  With the incredible globalist activities there, the attacks now on Winston Churchill, it's only intensifying.
[01:06:55.686 --> 01:06:58.227]  Paul Watson, thank you for joining us from Summit.News.
[01:06:59.497 --> 01:07:01.018]  Good to be back, Alex.
[01:07:01.018 --> 01:07:02.459]  You're in the epicenter of it in London.
[01:07:02.459 --> 01:07:03.360]  How would you describe it?
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:07.403]  You've been doing a great job the last few days, tweeting every five minutes, minute by minute.
[01:07:07.403 --> 01:07:09.425]  What's happening?
[01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:16.871]  Well, one thing I wouldn't describe it as, Alex, is largely peaceful, which is what the media here has been describing it as.
[01:07:16.871 --> 01:07:22.715]  But over a week now, and you've been in the middle of these rallies, I've been in the middle of this.
[01:07:22.715 --> 01:07:27.439]  You know, I've been to what they would call right-wing protests, Brexit events.
[01:07:28.287 --> 01:07:33.391]  Bilderberg protests, which, you know, are attended by both left-wing and right-wing people.
[01:07:33.391 --> 01:07:39.636]  Years ago, I used to attend anti-CND nuclear disarmament protests, which was entirely left-wing.
[01:07:39.636 --> 01:07:44.459]  In all those cases, the protests were almost entirely peaceful.
[01:07:44.459 --> 01:07:46.301]  This is not peaceful!
[01:07:46.301 --> 01:07:54.647]  If you're in the middle of this kind of protest, and you're just observing it, you've just got your phone out filming it, or if you're a media film crew,
[01:07:55.268 --> 01:07:59.510]  And then the mob attacks you simply because you're not on their side.
[01:07:59.510 --> 01:08:02.611]  That is not a largely peaceful protest.
[01:08:02.611 --> 01:08:06.972]  You know, they hold up signs saying, if you're not with us, you're against us.
[01:08:06.972 --> 01:08:11.554]  And Alex, I was in the middle of one of these protests last weekend at the U.S.
[01:08:11.554 --> 01:08:18.756]  Embassy in a car, stuck in the road for over an hour, probably an hour and a half, because they were blocking the traffic.
[01:08:18.756 --> 01:08:24.218]  Now, they would go up to each car and if you weren't wearing the right facial expression,
[01:08:24.977 --> 01:08:35.366]  Or if you went honking your horn, if you went sticking your fist out the window in support of these peaceful protesters, as they call them, they would harass you.
[01:08:35.366 --> 01:08:38.268]  They would try to stick leaflets through the window.
[01:08:38.268 --> 01:08:39.950]  And that was the best of it.
[01:08:39.950 --> 01:08:44.614]  A week later, they were literally trying to drag people out of their cars, as we've seen in America.
[01:08:44.614 --> 01:08:51.539]  And again, this is the mob attacking people who are merely just trying to drive away from the area or media observing it.
[01:08:51.539 --> 01:08:53.241]  That is not a peaceful protest.
[01:08:53.877 --> 01:09:04.565]  Over the weekend, Alex, in London, 35 police officers injured, chased by mobs, smoke bombs, objects thrown at them, police beaten.
[01:09:04.565 --> 01:09:09.629]  As you can see in the video right now, they tried to burn the British flag at the cenotaph.
[01:09:09.629 --> 01:09:15.594]  He's facing Winston Churchill statues, shouting, run, piggy, run, while attacking the police.
[01:09:16.201 --> 01:09:18.924]  Guess how the BBC reported this afterwards.
[01:09:18.924 --> 01:09:21.007]  Largely dismal.
[01:09:21.007 --> 01:09:29.797]  They said the policewoman that got hit in the head with a bottle on the horse's head, who was thrown off and has a punctured lung and is super ill, they said she did it on purpose.
[01:09:29.797 --> 01:09:31.199]  It's her fault they attacked her.
[01:09:32.711 --> 01:09:34.972]  Well, and yeah, what happened with that?
[01:09:34.972 --> 01:09:35.972]  They threw objects.
[01:09:35.972 --> 01:09:39.453]  They threw flares and bicycles at this police horse.
[01:09:39.453 --> 01:09:40.214]  It faltered.
[01:09:40.214 --> 01:09:43.615]  The female police officer smashed into traffic lights.
[01:09:43.615 --> 01:09:45.496]  She fell off unconscious.
[01:09:45.496 --> 01:09:49.257]  As he said, collapsed lung, broken collarbone, shattered ribs.
[01:09:49.257 --> 01:09:50.798]  She's going to be off work for six months.
[01:09:50.798 --> 01:09:53.018]  She could easily have been killed.
[01:09:53.018 --> 01:09:55.299]  Guess what CNN's headline was?
[01:09:55.299 --> 01:09:59.041]  Police Horse Causes Havoc at London Protest.
[01:09:59.041 --> 01:10:00.181]  Alex, that's like saying
[01:10:01.514 --> 01:10:05.635]  Airplane causes havoc during September flight to New York.
[01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:07.976]  This is how the media responded to this.
[01:10:07.976 --> 01:10:11.137]  You talk about the 35 police officers injured.
[01:10:11.137 --> 01:10:12.718]  BBC headline.
[01:10:12.718 --> 01:10:17.699]  Police officers injured during largely peaceful anti-racism protests in London.
[01:10:17.699 --> 01:10:23.901]  Again, that's like saying two skyscrapers knocked over during largely peaceful September flight.
[01:10:23.901 --> 01:10:25.782]  Absolutely insane.
[01:10:25.782 --> 01:10:26.242]  Imagine if
[01:10:27.578 --> 01:10:32.385]  35 police officers have been chased by mobs and attacked at a pro-Brexit rally.
[01:10:32.385 --> 01:10:35.630]  Would the media describe it as largely peaceful protest?
[01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:36.952]  Not in a million years.
[01:10:36.952 --> 01:10:39.897]  It's despicable how they've treated this.
[01:10:41.561 --> 01:10:48.685]  We also have where they're blocking traffic and attacking people in cars, and then a black dude gets out and fights back.
[01:10:48.685 --> 01:10:51.647]  Well, they call that a white supremacist attacking, but don't even show the actual footage.
[01:10:51.647 --> 01:10:58.832]  This is massive, concerted deception at every level to hide what's really going on, Paul.
[01:10:58.832 --> 01:11:02.934]  It's absolutely incredible, and it's just how the media responds to it.
[01:11:02.934 --> 01:11:07.977]  It's as if, you know, they would have reported that George Floyd kneeled on his own head.
[01:11:07.977 --> 01:11:09.118]  Absolutely incredible.
[01:11:09.873 --> 01:11:17.284]  And we also have to put up with this... Just a second, goodbye.
[01:11:17.284 --> 01:11:20.189]  Again, Paul Joseph Watson is live from London.
[01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:21.971]  Just give me a document cam shot and I'll show you.
[01:11:23.308 --> 01:11:25.530]  Some of this right now for TV viewers.
[01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:27.252]  Again, if you go out there, you can find this.
[01:11:27.252 --> 01:11:31.315]  She's throwing bricks, bottles, everything at horses and police.
[01:11:31.315 --> 01:11:40.264]  And then when a horse bolts and throws the police officer off and she gets hurt and then runs over a protester, they separately said the police attacked them.
[01:11:40.264 --> 01:11:43.707]  And then they, on top of that, then separately
[01:11:45.982 --> 01:11:46.322]  I don't
[01:12:00.879 --> 01:12:08.726]  They're saying she'll be out four months to a year and they're saying that she did this to herself when the horse was attacked.
[01:12:08.726 --> 01:12:15.052]  Because the leftists are virtuous beyond anything on earth and can never do any wrong.
[01:12:15.052 --> 01:12:16.534]  They can never do any harm.
[01:12:16.534 --> 01:12:17.074]  They are perfect.
[01:12:17.074 --> 01:12:18.115]  But again, what is this?
[01:12:18.115 --> 01:12:20.097]  It's not about the police.
[01:12:20.097 --> 01:12:22.960]  It's about the communists, the socialists, the globalists in a movement.
[01:12:24.195 --> 01:12:29.818]  To overthrow civilization and overthrow society to then bring in their system that's a hundred times worse.
[01:12:29.818 --> 01:12:31.499]  They're not going to get rid of the police.
[01:12:31.499 --> 01:12:34.421]  They're going to give you police like North Korea or communist China.
[01:12:34.421 --> 01:12:35.262]  That is their goal.
[01:12:35.262 --> 01:12:38.243]  And these police are primed all over Europe and the U.S.
[01:12:38.243 --> 01:12:43.166]  to kiss the ass of people assaulting them.
[01:12:43.166 --> 01:12:44.447]  And so they're asking for it.
[01:12:44.447 --> 01:12:45.388]  That's what this is all about.
[01:12:45.388 --> 01:12:51.591]  But, studies show in England, if you're nice to the police, they're mean to you because they also are authoritarian and they're overwhelmed.
[01:12:51.591 --> 01:12:52.272]  Because they're communists.
[01:12:54.428 --> 01:12:56.949]  We're living in insanely dangerous times.
[01:12:56.949 --> 01:13:02.830]  And I've told folks going back three months ago, I'm not buying storable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:05.691]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse.
[01:13:05.691 --> 01:13:13.052]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States.
[01:13:13.052 --> 01:13:14.573]  And it's even worse in the third world.
[01:13:14.573 --> 01:13:17.514]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it.
[01:13:17.514 --> 01:13:19.414]  But with the election fraud and the
[01:13:19.574 --> 01:13:19.814]  I think?
[01:13:43.865 --> 01:13:46.754]  Dependent on them, they do not want you to be self-sufficient.
[01:13:46.754 --> 01:13:50.405]  Get your storable food at infoorestore.com right now while you still can.
[01:13:52.685 --> 01:14:02.354]  I had told listeners back in December that I would never go to 50% off again because our markup isn't big enough selling the products to be able to fund ourselves doing that.
[01:14:02.354 --> 01:14:14.866]  But I gotta tell you, things are so crazy, the world is so insane, my gut level instinct is sell out everything we've got in the warehouse to make sure we can stay on air through the election in 150 days.
[01:14:14.866 --> 01:14:17.328]  Because we only got money to operate a few months right now.
[01:14:17.748 --> 01:14:20.111]  So these are great products you and your family need.
[01:14:20.111 --> 01:14:21.393]  It funds the info war.
[01:14:21.393 --> 01:14:22.974]  Get them all now.
[01:14:22.974 --> 01:14:24.416]  These are staples.

[01:14:56.041 --> 01:14:58.642]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:09.821]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:15:09.821 --> 01:15:11.902]  Paul Joseph Watson lives right in the middle of London.
[01:15:11.902 --> 01:15:14.004]  It looked like an emergency.
[01:15:14.004 --> 01:15:17.786]  He just jumped up and said, just a moment.
[01:15:17.786 --> 01:15:24.010]  And then we heard a little bit of noise and then disconnected the Skype and we don't know what happened.
[01:15:24.010 --> 01:15:25.531]  So I'm calling Paul.
[01:15:25.531 --> 01:15:28.533]  Hope he's okay.
[01:15:28.533 --> 01:15:31.936]  We'll follow that as it unfolds.
[01:15:31.936 --> 01:15:35.418]  Looking at Paul's Twitter feed, I mean, I see what's coming in.
[01:15:35.418 --> 01:15:36.699]  F all white people.
[01:15:38.542 --> 01:15:41.685]  Overthrow capitalism.
[01:15:41.685 --> 01:15:46.828]  This is what America and the world has turned into.
[01:15:46.828 --> 01:15:58.337]  And it's because there are 6.9 billion people that quote aren't white.
[01:15:58.337 --> 01:16:03.221]  That's the vast majority of people on the planet.
[01:16:03.221 --> 01:16:07.705]  And the UN and the globalists have looked at the demographics and they're going to make it about
[01:16:08.522 --> 01:16:28.013]  Race and make it about being anti-white and then the big mega banks and all the big powerful elites are going to sit up there in their armored fortresses while directing the destruction of Western society and the Christian system that actually tried to build up the third world and bring medicine and electricity and science to it.
[01:16:28.013 --> 01:16:30.855]  So the Western world was really a breakaway civilization.
[01:16:32.438 --> 01:16:35.939]  A more advanced civilization was trying to raise up the other civilizations.
[01:16:35.939 --> 01:16:37.120]  That was called colonialism.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:42.482]  There were certainly some exploits and bad things that were done, but what the globalists are bringing in is not colonialism.
[01:16:42.482 --> 01:16:55.647]  It is a total collapse of all civilization, but small, globalist citadels or city-states of advanced technology, or the Elysium Fields.
[01:16:55.647 --> 01:17:01.109]  In Greek mythology, Elysium is not a space station where the ultra-rich live in orbit.
[01:17:01.109 --> 01:17:01.449]  It is
[01:17:03.536 --> 01:17:14.122]  High plains or mountaintops or mesas, fabled mesas on which the faithful of the gods could become immortal as well.
[01:17:14.122 --> 01:17:16.904]  To the golden fields of Elysium.
[01:17:16.904 --> 01:17:21.106]  Gold with all the wheat.
[01:17:21.106 --> 01:17:23.708]  And the globalists are taking control of the future.
[01:17:23.708 --> 01:17:26.730]  They believe that they are the apex predators who are reintroducing
[01:17:28.723 --> 01:17:33.284]  Social Darwinism, or Theory of the Species, to the people.
[01:17:33.284 --> 01:17:38.385]  And it's true, if you kill off all the coyotes or all the wolves, you're going to have an overpopulation of deer.
[01:17:38.385 --> 01:17:44.466]  And so humans come in, and it's good to harvest the deer, and it's good to keep their population at a good level that's sustainable.
[01:17:44.466 --> 01:17:55.528]  Well, the globalists have that same attitude that there's too many humans, that there's too many people, that we become lackadaisical, we become stupid, we become lazy, and that
[01:17:57.932 --> 01:18:02.656]  We deserve what is being done to us.
[01:18:02.656 --> 01:18:14.665]  And so Bill Gates, because there aren't predators, saber-toothed tigers and other tribes of men killing us, he has to come in and fulfill that role.
[01:18:14.665 --> 01:18:25.174]  But then you study Bill Gates and Jeffrey Epstein and their secret cloning programs and all the things they're involved in, and there's some of the most degenerate, sickening people of all, who just seek power and control
[01:18:26.866 --> 01:18:30.787]  Over everyone and who do not want a survival of the fittest system.
[01:18:30.787 --> 01:18:40.329]  They want a technocracy monopoly over humanity and to make independent wild human living impossible.
[01:18:40.329 --> 01:18:49.392]  And that make us an artificiality that is produced by the mega corporations that will now play God and decide what humans or humanoids can live on this planet.
[01:18:49.392 --> 01:18:50.732]  And everything we do here
[01:18:56.027 --> 01:19:01.491]  is about exposing just that.
[01:19:01.491 --> 01:19:14.680]  You look at the university rabble that have been taught that they're the rulers of the earth, the masters of the universe, that they've gone and paid for worthless degrees so they're going to be controlling the new green deal, the new globalist deal.
[01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:21.104]  And whether they're in Europe, whether they're in Australia, whether they're in New Zealand, whether they're in Canada or the United States, they are dumbed down
[01:19:22.199 --> 01:19:28.285]  They are hateful, they are ignorant, and they hate free speech, and they want oppression.
[01:19:28.285 --> 01:19:38.415]  And they're brutish, and ill-informed, and have the dead eyes of a crazy zombie because they are the slaves.
[01:19:45.287 --> 01:19:48.409]  And they are worshipped by the media and worshipped by the culture.
[01:19:48.409 --> 01:19:53.813]  They're not given jobs or power by Twitter and Facebook giving them dopamine rushes.
[01:19:53.813 --> 01:20:08.943]  But as they attack every symbol and every archetype and every foundation and every statue and statute, they believe they're having a coming of age and a great seething of power and control.
[01:20:08.943 --> 01:20:13.266]  And then those that join in hop around ghoulishly
[01:20:14.605 --> 01:20:14.905]  I think?
[01:20:28.689 --> 01:20:34.214]  And begin burning down the buildings and tearing down the statues and burning down the libraries.
[01:20:34.214 --> 01:20:37.937]  Because to them, that's not a symbol of knowledge and empowerment.
[01:20:37.937 --> 01:20:47.585]  That's a symbol of superiority that if they can squat on it and defecate on it and burn the British flag,
[01:20:51.533 --> 01:20:56.936]  If they can burn the American flag, well somehow that gives them primacy.
[01:20:56.936 --> 01:21:00.097]  That gives them hegemonic power and control over it.
[01:21:00.097 --> 01:21:00.638]  When in truth...
[01:21:01.991 --> 01:21:29.868]  The globalists already conquered England a long time ago and then brought in people and put them on welfare and turned them against the system and used them as a client and now are deploying them against the last vestiges of the old state which will then be swept away and with it brutal oppression, brutal control against the real target, the seed or the zenith or the genesis point
[01:21:31.508 --> 01:21:49.643]  of the Renaissance and of modern Christendom and the radical liberal egalitarian plan to empower humanity, that must be pulled down by the neoliberals and the neocons and the technocrats because it stands in the way of their hegemonic world rule.
[01:21:49.643 --> 01:21:50.583]  And so that's where we are.
[01:21:50.583 --> 01:21:53.446]  And as a society, that's what we face.
[01:21:56.035 --> 01:22:17.023]  And that's why it's not a failure of the globalists that their minions attacked the glory soldier, black soldiers from the North, Civil War monument, or attacked the World War II monument, or attacked the Winston Churchill monument, or attacked the Lincoln Memorial.
[01:22:18.277 --> 01:22:21.718]  And sprayed racist on Abraham Lincoln.
[01:22:21.718 --> 01:22:27.701]  The fact that the minions are that stupid is an act of victory.
[01:22:27.701 --> 01:22:31.963]  It's a symbol of their brains being sucked out.
[01:22:31.963 --> 01:22:39.546]  And the police going to the local universities and laying on their bellies to empower the mad youth brigade mobs.
[01:22:41.530 --> 01:22:46.475]  To believe that they are the rightful rulers and they should go out and burn everything down.
[01:22:46.475 --> 01:22:51.560]  This is simply the globalists finishing America off, finishing the UK off.
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:59.609]  When I was on Twitter this morning reading a lot of the people, you know, saying kill all the whites, burn down America, burn down England, almost all of them had EU flags.
[01:23:03.112 --> 01:23:05.094]  Up there in the symbol of who they were.
[01:23:05.094 --> 01:23:10.478]  The EU, unelected, tyrannical, incredibly corrupt, a plan of Adolf Hitler.
[01:23:10.478 --> 01:23:12.760]  But they know it's the EU getting rid of borders.
[01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:14.301]  They know it's the EU promising them
[01:23:15.751 --> 01:23:16.512]  Unlimited welfare.
[01:23:16.512 --> 01:23:26.279]  They know it's the EU that says, we're going to bring in 680 million people from other countries into the US, 250 million into Europe, we're going to overthrow it all, whites are the enemy.
[01:23:26.279 --> 01:23:36.648]  These are people that literally believe that because they're brown, if they could literally just kill all the whites, suddenly all of what the West has built would be theirs.
[01:23:36.648 --> 01:23:41.592]  Just like the German vandals, as they're called.
[01:23:43.436 --> 01:23:50.938]  The Visigoths, those would be Austrians, when they invaded Rome in 410 and burned it all down, they thought they were conquering it, but really they were just destroying it.
[01:23:50.938 --> 01:23:54.200]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism.
[01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:59.261]  And so, populist movements are throwing the globalists out of their countries.
[01:23:59.261 --> 01:24:10.185]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division, and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services.
[01:24:10.965 --> 01:24:19.389]  This is an attempt to have society collapse, and the globalists, as they've done in the third world, will come in and pick up the pieces.
[01:24:19.389 --> 01:24:26.012]  We must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU openly saying, defund the police.
[01:24:26.012 --> 01:24:27.312]  The police have a lot of problems.
[01:24:27.312 --> 01:24:28.673]  We all have a lot of problems.
[01:24:28.673 --> 01:24:31.434]  But this is our government and our local constabulary.
[01:24:31.434 --> 01:24:33.515]  And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country,
[01:24:34.363 --> 01:24:38.405]  They are going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[01:24:38.405 --> 01:24:42.166]  The globalists believe communist China is the model of the world.
[01:24:42.166 --> 01:24:44.347]  And they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[01:24:44.347 --> 01:24:48.788]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed.
[01:24:48.788 --> 01:24:49.869]  InfoWars.com
[01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:57.228]  Hello GCP here to tell you not to leave the info world dot com.

[01:25:36.037 --> 01:25:38.058]  You go bankrupt and die.

[01:25:39.478 --> 01:25:41.399]  InfoWars is weak.
[01:25:41.399 --> 01:25:42.960]  Do not take advantage of 60% off.
[01:25:42.960 --> 01:25:43.140]  G.G.
[01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:43.840]  Pink says so.
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:44.640]  Oh, we hurt you.
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:45.281]  Oh, Joe Biden good.
[01:25:50.783 --> 01:26:01.854]  Hey guys, Rob Dew here with InfoWarsStore.com, and I want to tell you about something that I think has really helped me out, and I think can help you out too, especially if you have any problems sleeping, and that's knockout.
[01:26:01.854 --> 01:26:10.183]  Let's face it, our life patterns have been disrupted by this lockdown, this government-imposed imprisonment, and it has definitely affected my sleep schedule.
[01:26:10.183 --> 01:26:11.604]  But one thing that has helped is knockout.
[01:26:11.784 --> 01:26:12.265]  I don't know.
[01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:27.201]  We're good to go!
[01:26:53.958 --> 01:26:56.568]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:19.418 --> 01:27:23.501]  I'd like to call to order this secret conclave of America's media empires.
[01:27:23.501 --> 01:27:32.028]  We're here to come up with the next phony baloney crisis to put Americans back where they belong in dark rooms, glued to their televisions, too terrified to skip the commercials.
[01:27:32.028 --> 01:27:37.012]  Well, I think... NBC, you are here to listen and not speak.
[01:27:37.012 --> 01:27:39.154]  I think we should go with the good old-fashioned public health care.
[01:27:39.154 --> 01:27:39.334]  Yeah.
[01:27:40.732 --> 01:27:41.613]  A new disease!
[01:27:41.613 --> 01:27:42.573]  No one's immune!
[01:27:42.573 --> 01:27:46.015]  It's like the summer of the shark, except instead of a shark, it's an epidemic!
[01:27:46.015 --> 01:27:47.916]  And instead of summer, it's all the time!
[01:27:47.916 --> 01:27:52.618]  Now I hate to be the guy who derails what everybody else loves.
[01:27:52.618 --> 01:27:54.259]  He loves being that guy.
[01:27:54.259 --> 01:27:56.940]  But Janice, we do have standards.
[01:27:56.940 --> 01:27:58.901]  This can't be a made-up disease.
[01:27:58.901 --> 01:28:03.384]  The only moral thing to do is release a deadly virus into the general public.
[01:28:03.384 --> 01:28:07.146]  We do have something we've been holding on to, but it hasn't been tested.
[01:28:07.146 --> 01:28:07.906]  Get over here, NBC.
[01:28:10.227 --> 01:28:16.089]  Well, we certainly believe in testing, but I... Oh!
[01:28:16.089 --> 01:28:17.069]  Wow!
[01:28:17.069 --> 01:28:17.609]  Wow!
[01:28:17.609 --> 01:28:18.470]  Oh yeah!
[01:28:18.470 --> 01:28:20.670]  So, we've got our deadly disease.
[01:28:20.670 --> 01:28:25.112]  Now we just have to blame it on something that's in every household.
[01:28:25.112 --> 01:28:27.913]  Something that people are a little bit afraid of already.
[01:28:27.913 --> 01:28:30.413]  House Cat Flu is coming, people!
[01:28:30.413 --> 01:28:37.796]  The Center for Disease Disinformation predicts with some degree of probability that the House Cat Flu might spread in the following hypothetical outbreak pattern.
[01:28:39.574 --> 01:28:51.642]  So petter beware, that warm body on your lap just might be ready to destroy your tender fiddles.
[01:28:51.642 --> 01:28:56.545]  Springfielders are advised to stay tuned for more information if they experience any of the following symptoms.
[01:28:56.545 --> 01:28:59.507]  Mild thirst, occasional hunger, tiredness at night.
[01:29:01.727 --> 01:29:03.428]  Well, Alex Jones here back live.
[01:29:03.428 --> 01:29:12.176]  Paul Joseph Watson had a fire alarm and the power going out there in London, site of the Soros UN-funded riots that are going on.
[01:29:12.176 --> 01:29:16.960]  And now the president of Belarus has come out and said they had no real COVID-19 cases.
[01:29:16.960 --> 01:29:19.822]  The president of Tanzania says no real cases.
[01:29:19.822 --> 01:29:25.667]  Bill Melendigate sent fake testing kits that all normal deaths, heart attacks, cancer, gunshots,
[01:29:27.418 --> 01:29:29.999]  Bear attacks have been counted.
[01:29:29.999 --> 01:29:32.699]  George Floyd, they said, died of COVID-19.
[01:29:32.699 --> 01:29:34.519]  That's on the death certificate.
[01:29:34.519 --> 01:29:35.320]  Or he had it.
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:37.720]  This is how they operate.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:45.182]  That's another subject we'll hit next segment with Paul Joseph Watson, but he is back with us now from Summit.News from London, England.
[01:29:45.182 --> 01:29:49.843]  So Paul, where we left off there, glad you're okay now there at your studios.
[01:29:51.403 --> 01:29:52.543]  Where is this going?
[01:29:52.543 --> 01:29:55.224]  It looks like the demonstrations are being encouraged by media.
[01:29:55.224 --> 01:29:57.824]  The more people they attack, the more they're called peaceful.
[01:29:57.824 --> 01:29:59.865]  They're definitely pushing to undermine the president.
[01:29:59.865 --> 01:30:01.025]  They're calling him Jimmy Carter.
[01:30:01.025 --> 01:30:02.625]  They're saying he can't rule.
[01:30:02.625 --> 01:30:07.046]  But this is an international movement saying defund and abolish the police.
[01:30:07.046 --> 01:30:11.807]  Well, who's going to make us all social distance and stay inside and all this?
[01:30:11.807 --> 01:30:17.288]  Oh, the new contact tracers, the new domestic security forces that are just as big.
[01:30:17.828 --> 01:30:19.189]  Just as strong as our military.
[01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:23.991]  I guess the same folks beating up the police who bow down to them, I guess that's who's going to enforce things, Paul?
[01:30:23.991 --> 01:30:29.473]  Because it is modeled after the mal-enforcement cultural revolution, isn't it?
[01:30:29.473 --> 01:30:39.257]  Well, it is truly a cultural revolution, and the goal is to tear down society and remold it in their image, and their image is pretty ugly.
[01:30:39.257 --> 01:30:45.039]  But on the subject of social distancing, you know, Alex, we've been told for the past three months that we can't
[01:30:45.742 --> 01:30:59.686]  We can't hug our parents, we can't attend funerals, we can't gather anywhere outside in groups of more than six, and we can't even get a haircut, yet tens of thousands of people are able to gather in London and nobody cares.
[01:30:59.686 --> 01:31:10.530]  You know, we had a scandal for the past week which was a government advisor called Dominic Cummings, who was in trouble for arranging urgent care for his child.
[01:31:10.530 --> 01:31:14.951]  He was subject to absolute vitriol and abuse for a period of over a week.
[01:31:15.686 --> 01:31:21.429]  That was a big deal, Alex, but tens of thousands of them congregating in huge numbers, that's nothing.
[01:31:21.429 --> 01:31:25.270]  I mean, what is going on there?
[01:31:25.270 --> 01:31:26.671]  Total hypocrisy.
[01:31:26.671 --> 01:31:28.992]  Paul, this is a cult programming.
[01:31:28.992 --> 01:31:31.593]  This is what cults do, and they admit it's a cult.
[01:31:31.593 --> 01:31:34.194]  And Fauci admits wearing the mask is a cult.
[01:31:34.194 --> 01:31:39.137]  I mean, this whole thing has been nothing but a giant power grab.
[01:31:39.137 --> 01:31:41.157]  Well, yeah, it's a religious worship.
[01:31:41.157 --> 01:31:42.078]  They're kneeling down.
[01:31:43.016 --> 01:31:46.618]  In terms of London, let's just look at the stats here.
[01:31:46.618 --> 01:31:50.559]  We've had a massive problem with knife crime in London.
[01:31:50.559 --> 01:31:54.681]  And who are the main victims of that knife crime?
[01:31:54.681 --> 01:31:58.863]  73% of knife offenders and 53% of victims are black.
[01:31:58.863 --> 01:32:00.884]  Now, nobody's protesting that.
[01:32:00.884 --> 01:32:08.507]  You just had a weekend in Chicago where I think it was 29 people were killed or 29 people were injured, 3 were killed.
[01:32:08.507 --> 01:32:10.168]  Nobody's protesting that.
[01:32:10.168 --> 01:32:12.109]  You know, we've got a situation in London where
[01:32:12.833 --> 01:32:16.957]  We have a massive epidemic of black-on-black knife crime.
[01:32:16.957 --> 01:32:19.739]  There's nobody kneeling in the streets over that, Alex.
[01:32:19.739 --> 01:32:25.885]  They have white people in areas of London with massive knife crime problems kneeling on the streets.
[01:32:25.885 --> 01:32:29.207]  Where were they when we had the highest knife crime?
[01:32:29.207 --> 01:32:30.909]  Higher than even New York.
[01:32:30.909 --> 01:32:32.851]  They were completely AWOL, Alex.
[01:32:33.476 --> 01:32:40.201]  Well, my 16-year-old daughter yesterday, when we were tubing the San Marcos River, she said, I really like Paul Watson.
[01:32:40.201 --> 01:32:41.843]  He's cute.
[01:32:41.843 --> 01:32:43.464]  He ought to come to town again, literally.
[01:32:43.464 --> 01:32:47.107]  But she goes, but why is he on your show if he's in the UK?
[01:32:47.107 --> 01:32:50.809]  And I said, honey, and her friend was asking us, that was with us, I said, honey,
[01:32:51.874 --> 01:32:53.456]  We're all interconnected.
[01:32:53.456 --> 01:32:57.120]  The same globalists trying to take down the UK are attacking us.
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:00.004]  And so it's important to get commentary from over there.
[01:33:00.004 --> 01:33:01.225]  He gives his commentary over here.
[01:33:01.225 --> 01:33:03.368]  I give him a perspective on his country.
[01:33:03.368 --> 01:33:04.469]  He gives me a perspective.
[01:33:04.469 --> 01:33:06.452]  I'm not over there telling him what to do.
[01:33:06.452 --> 01:33:10.957]  I'm showing we have a common enemy, just like in World War II or during the Cold War.
[01:33:11.778 --> 01:33:17.966]  But you mentioned this, Instagram censors FBI crime stats graph as hate speech.
[01:33:17.966 --> 01:33:19.407]  These are from the FBI.
[01:33:19.407 --> 01:33:20.369]  We've shown these numbers.
[01:33:20.369 --> 01:33:22.892]  Let's scroll through that for TV viewers.
[01:33:22.892 --> 01:33:26.096]  Radio listeners, you should go to InfoWars.com or NewsWars.com to get this.
[01:33:27.236 --> 01:33:40.501]  And it's FBI numbers, the latest numbers were published two years ago, published over the last few decades, and it says your post goes against our community guidelines, and it shows blacks killed by whites, including police, is the lowest number.
[01:33:40.501 --> 01:33:45.483]  Blacks are ten times more likely to kill whites, and it goes over these numbers.
[01:33:45.483 --> 01:33:49.424]  So again, whites killed by blacks, 9.83.
[01:33:49.424 --> 01:33:50.365]  Blacks killed by whites, 0.77.
[01:33:50.365 --> 01:33:51.565]  So when I say it's more than
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:55.080]  Ten times.
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:57.682]  And these are hard, hard numbers.
[01:33:57.682 --> 01:33:59.903]  But again, this isn't about black people.
[01:33:59.903 --> 01:34:01.204]  The left wants to kill them.
[01:34:01.204 --> 01:34:04.586]  They've got the abortuaries, the Planned Parenthood.
[01:34:04.586 --> 01:34:07.407]  Most of the crime is black-on-black in those areas.
[01:34:07.407 --> 01:34:08.108]  It's even worse.
[01:34:08.108 --> 01:34:09.308]  It's terrible.
[01:34:09.308 --> 01:34:18.354]  But look, white-on-black crime, 59,000 against 547,000 plus in the same year.
[01:34:18.354 --> 01:34:20.235]  You just cannot argue with this.
[01:34:20.235 --> 01:34:23.997]  But now actual numbers from the government aren't allowed, Paul.
[01:34:26.065 --> 01:34:28.387]  No, you can look at it from either side of the Atlantic.
[01:34:28.387 --> 01:34:32.430]  I mean, something that I've been retweeting over the past week is a stat.
[01:34:32.430 --> 01:34:37.113]  Again, you can get banned for tweeting these hate stats, they call them.
[01:34:37.113 --> 01:34:39.956]  You can get censored on Instagram for this.
[01:34:39.956 --> 01:34:41.997]  And the one out of America is this.
[01:34:41.997 --> 01:34:46.981]  For every 10,000 black people arrested for violent crime, three are killed.
[01:34:46.981 --> 01:34:50.964]  For every 10,000 white people arrested for violent crime, four are killed.
[01:34:51.644 --> 01:34:56.086]  The very premise, the very foundation of BLM is completely fraudulent.
[01:34:56.086 --> 01:35:01.188]  And then you look at the UK, Alex, and this is reported by the BBC.
[01:35:01.188 --> 01:35:07.591]  Over the past 10 years, before that, we had these protests over police brutality in the UK.
[01:35:07.591 --> 01:35:13.574]  In the whole of 2019, there were two unarmed people killed by cops in the UK, okay?
[01:35:13.574 --> 01:35:18.156]  One was a terrorist, and we say unarmed, that means they don't have a gun.
[01:35:18.156 --> 01:35:19.817]  That was the guy on London Bridge who had
[01:35:21.247 --> 01:35:24.729]  Knives, he was trying to attack cops, he was chasing people down the street.
[01:35:24.729 --> 01:35:27.930]  So two unarmed people killed in the UK in the entire year of 2019.
[01:35:27.930 --> 01:35:30.392]  And didn't he have a fake bomb on his chest?
[01:35:30.392 --> 01:35:32.873]  Yeah, he had a fake bomb, fake explosives.
[01:35:32.873 --> 01:35:34.214]  That was the entire year of 2019.
[01:35:34.214 --> 01:35:42.738]  The BBC reported over the past 10 years, 163 people have died in police custody in England.
[01:35:42.738 --> 01:35:43.418]  Of the 163, 13 were black.
[01:35:43.418 --> 01:35:43.578]  13 out of 163.
[01:35:49.648 --> 01:35:58.715]  And a white individual who's been arrested was 25% times more likely to die in custody than a black individual who's been arrested.
[01:35:58.715 --> 01:36:02.658]  So the entire premise of this in the US and the UK is completely fraudulent.
[01:36:02.658 --> 01:36:03.419]  Just like COVID-19!
[01:36:03.419 --> 01:36:04.760]  So why are they protesting?
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:05.701]  It's a total fraud.
[01:36:06.621 --> 01:36:13.824]  And I saw an article out a few months ago pointing out that UK police are mean to the nices, nice to the meanies, and that's what I've experienced.
[01:36:13.824 --> 01:36:20.827]  A lot of cops are good, but let me tell you, being a white guy, when they pulled me over, I was instantly to jail because I had two glasses of wine.
[01:36:20.827 --> 01:36:22.468]  I know cops, man, black cops.
[01:36:22.468 --> 01:36:24.709]  They won't even mess with black people.
[01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:33.738]  Which is the inverse, then that allows crime to explode, and the slow rolling in these communities then helps the criminals murder people, which does kill black people.
[01:36:33.738 --> 01:36:34.359]  It's incredible.
[01:36:34.359 --> 01:36:43.649]  Paul, let's talk more about this and shift gears to some other big subjects, like where's COVID-19 going, what's going to happen with Trump, the latest 4chan trolls, and more.
[01:36:43.649 --> 01:36:45.431]  Check out Paul's excellent site.
[01:36:45.431 --> 01:36:46.693]  It's summit.news.
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:54.421]  We're living in insanely dangerous times.
[01:36:54.421 --> 01:37:00.303]  And I've told folks going back three months ago, I'm not buying storable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[01:37:00.303 --> 01:37:03.184]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse.
[01:37:03.184 --> 01:37:10.526]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States.
[01:37:10.526 --> 01:37:12.066]  And it's even worse in the third world.
[01:37:12.066 --> 01:37:14.987]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it.
[01:37:14.987 --> 01:37:16.888]  But with the election fraud and the
[01:37:17.068 --> 01:37:17.368]  I think so.

[01:37:57.946 --> 01:38:04.613]  We have not done 60% off across the board in the history of InfoWars.
[01:38:04.613 --> 01:38:09.038]  But because things are so crazy, I'm offering the biggest sale in our history.

[01:38:09.939 --> 01:38:11.740]  I don't know if it's going to last a day, a week.
[01:38:12.461 --> 01:38:22.747]  But we're selling out of all the major products because I kind of feel like the Titanic is sinking and we need to have the funds in our bank account to fund the Infowar into the future.

[01:38:51.201 --> 01:39:05.909]  I've hunted a lot of big game at long distances with high caliber rifles and when you shoot an elk at say 600 yards, even if you hit them right in the heart, they'll still run 50, 60, 70, maybe 100 yards.
[01:39:05.909 --> 01:39:16.415]  They've got that adrenaline pumping through their arteries and through their veins, but all of a sudden they slow down, they realize what's happened, they fall over, and they die.
[01:39:16.415 --> 01:39:18.617]  Then you go bag them and haul them back in.
[01:39:19.497 --> 01:39:22.999]  Well, that's what's going to happen to the entire world now.
[01:39:22.999 --> 01:39:28.863]  And that's what the economic numbers show, is that we've been shot right in the heart.
[01:39:28.863 --> 01:39:33.966]  And for the first world, it's going to mean a long, horrible depression and a lot of death.
[01:39:33.966 --> 01:39:38.169]  Well, for the third world, it's going to mean probably over 100 million dead, according to the UN, and I believe their numbers.
[01:39:38.809 --> 01:39:43.534]  Because it's the very UN that's orchestrated this to depopulate the third world.
[01:39:43.534 --> 01:39:49.842]  So to all the leftists that thought it was their revolution to get rid of Trump, you're a bunch of suckers and you've bought into something bigger than what Hitler did.
[01:39:51.215 --> 01:40:09.406]  I've been fighting the globalists for 26 years and the evil side of me is just so tired of waiting and I'm so ready for physical war that I'm kind of happy about how bad things have gotten because all the delusional folks that don't stand up for the unborn babies that go along with the New World Order, you're about to find out just how sick stuff is.
[01:40:09.406 --> 01:40:10.227]  But you know what?
[01:40:10.227 --> 01:40:11.788]  The average person is still asleep.
[01:40:11.788 --> 01:40:13.569]  They don't deserve what's happening to them.
[01:40:13.569 --> 01:40:14.630]  So I'm actually sick
[01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:18.433]  About what's unfolding right now, and I just want to turn things around.
[01:40:18.433 --> 01:40:19.433]  But you know what?
[01:40:19.433 --> 01:40:21.495]  I can't do that without you.
[01:40:21.495 --> 01:40:22.876]  I can't get out of this mess.
[01:40:22.876 --> 01:40:26.839]  I can't get out of this stranglehold I'm in, unless you decide to get out of it as well.
[01:40:26.839 --> 01:40:27.780]  We're all in this together.
[01:40:27.780 --> 01:40:36.067]  And so if you just realize how important you are, when you just tell people about the local radio stations you're listening to, local TV stations, when you just spread the word about Infowars.com.com.com.com.
[01:40:36.827 --> 01:40:40.370]  When you just buy the products at MFORESTORE.COM, it changes the world.

[01:40:54.022 --> 01:40:56.645]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:08.091 --> 01:41:12.052]  It's Paul Joseph Watson and Summit.News.
[01:41:12.052 --> 01:41:15.533]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:41:15.533 --> 01:41:18.414]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:41:18.414 --> 01:41:22.095]  And we're with Infowars.com.
[01:41:22.095 --> 01:41:23.956]  We've got a lot to cover in this final segment with Paul.
[01:41:23.956 --> 01:41:27.957]  I'm going to open the phones up next hour.
[01:41:27.957 --> 01:41:30.138]  But I asked Paul, what do you want to cover next?
[01:41:30.138 --> 01:41:34.219]  He said, I want to cover the 1,200 doctors and scientists saying,
[01:41:35.993 --> 01:41:38.514]  It doesn't hurt anyone physically to go out and demonstrate.
[01:41:38.514 --> 01:41:45.819]  There's no COVID issue there, but anyone out protesting, the lockdowns should be arrested.
[01:41:45.819 --> 01:41:46.979]  Let's put it on screen.
[01:41:46.979 --> 01:41:49.201]  This is from their quote.
[01:41:49.201 --> 01:41:55.184]  As a public health advocates, we do not condemn these gatherings as risky for COVID-19 transmission.
[01:41:55.184 --> 01:41:59.907]  This should not be confused with a permissive stance on all gatherings, particularly
[01:42:01.155 --> 01:42:03.637]  Protest against stay-at-home orders.
[01:42:03.637 --> 01:42:06.880]  So this is literally George Orwell's animal farm come true.
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:10.303]  Because at first the pigs say, let's have a revolt.
[01:42:10.303 --> 01:42:11.445]  The humans are in the house.
[01:42:11.445 --> 01:42:13.326]  Four legs good, two legs bad.
[01:42:13.326 --> 01:42:16.769]  Once they run the humans off though, they enslave everybody ten times worse.
[01:42:16.769 --> 01:42:18.911]  It's an allegory of communists.
[01:42:18.911 --> 01:42:21.454]  Orwell had been a communist no matter how bad they were.
[01:42:21.454 --> 01:42:24.457]  And they said, oh no, by the end, two legs good, four legs bad.
[01:42:25.441 --> 01:42:29.404]  And if you said, wait, you used to say four legs good, they'd kill you.
[01:42:29.404 --> 01:42:35.029]  Hey, wait, just a few years ago, you said four legs good, two legs bad.
[01:42:35.029 --> 01:42:37.311]  Well, you're dead if you say that.
[01:42:37.311 --> 01:42:45.157]  Of course, the horse, the archetype of the working class that brought the commies into power, they ship it off to the glue factory.
[01:42:45.157 --> 01:42:46.298]  So Paul Joseph Watson,
[01:42:47.341 --> 01:42:49.163]  Joins us to talk about this.
[01:42:49.163 --> 01:42:50.404]  People say, well, it doesn't make sense.
[01:42:50.404 --> 01:42:52.346]  There's no logic to it.
[01:42:52.346 --> 01:42:53.587]  There's not supposed to be a logic.
[01:42:53.587 --> 01:42:54.688]  This is a cult.
[01:42:54.688 --> 01:43:00.354]  This is the strength of the New World Order that their followers are so stupid and so idiotic and so bad, Paul.
[01:43:02.233 --> 01:43:17.265]  No, they literally went, Alex, in the space of 10 days from saying that stay-at-home protesters in the US and, in fact, in the UK, anti-lockdown protesters, same thing, were literally killing granny by going outside and protesting.
[01:43:17.265 --> 01:43:19.327]  And these people weren't even congregating.
[01:43:19.327 --> 01:43:22.250]  They were inside their vehicles for the most part.
[01:43:22.250 --> 01:43:27.474]  And you had the scenes in Arizona and other places of the nurses out blocking traffic.
[01:43:28.368 --> 01:43:37.863]  When these stay-at-home protests happened, the same nurses in numerous American cities now, over the past few days, literally applauding Black Lives Matter.
[01:43:38.755 --> 01:43:42.737]  As they congregate in gigantic numbers on the street.
[01:43:42.737 --> 01:43:49.139]  Oh, but we're killing granny, but that's okay because racism is a bigger public health threat.
[01:43:49.139 --> 01:43:59.784]  Oh, by the way, in the UK, BAME people, we've been lectured for the past two, three weeks, meaning black or brown people, are disproportionately more likely to get COVID and that's racist.
[01:43:59.784 --> 01:44:01.244]  What are we going to do about that?
[01:44:01.244 --> 01:44:02.545]  Well, what did you do about it?
[01:44:02.545 --> 01:44:03.925]  What did you say about it?
[01:44:03.925 --> 01:44:05.266]  You literally celebrated
[01:44:06.078 --> 01:44:16.581]  Fame people congregating in huge numbers, spreading, if you believe their narrative, Covid between each other in greater and greater numbers.
[01:44:16.581 --> 01:44:19.562]  And you mentioned the 1,200 public health officials.
[01:44:19.562 --> 01:44:25.884]  In their open letter they literally said, and this is the worst example of double thing I've ever experienced,
[01:44:26.491 --> 01:44:31.676]  When Black Lives Matter go out and protest, that's fine because racism's a bigger health threat.
[01:44:31.676 --> 01:44:38.383]  But those stay-at-home protesters, they're all white supremacists, so that's bad when they do it.
[01:44:38.383 --> 01:44:40.585]  They literally said that in the letter.
[01:44:40.585 --> 01:44:43.008]  And now we have Piers Morgan,
[01:44:44.048 --> 01:44:51.216]  The guy who, for the past three months in the UK, has absolutely hounded anyone who opposes this lockdown.
[01:44:51.216 --> 01:45:00.025]  Going on Twitter one day, chastising a Member of Parliament for attending the BLM protest, saying he's irresponsible and disgusting.
[01:45:00.025 --> 01:45:06.632]  The very next day, praising his own son for attending the very same BLM protest.
[01:45:07.347 --> 01:45:10.829]  And again, Alex, this proves what we've been saying for the past two months.
[01:45:10.829 --> 01:45:12.910]  Coronavirus was a big threat in China.
[01:45:12.910 --> 01:45:14.351]  We didn't downplay it.
[01:45:14.351 --> 01:45:15.972]  It was a serious issue.
[01:45:15.972 --> 01:45:29.840]  But these lockdowns, which will kill infinitely more people than coronavirus did, are complete BS, proven now by the fact that they're advocating celebrating the congregation of people in huge numbers.
[01:45:29.840 --> 01:45:33.222]  We've been proven right once again.
[01:45:33.222 --> 01:45:33.662]  Logic?
[01:45:34.966 --> 01:45:37.569]  Is an enemy and truth is a menace.
[01:45:37.569 --> 01:45:45.416]  That was said by one of my favorite writers many, many years ago in 1962, Rod Serling.
[01:45:45.416 --> 01:45:46.637]  I don't think this is a simulation.
[01:45:46.637 --> 01:45:57.868]  I know this is real, but the way the left and globalist act is so cartoonish until you realize they're trying to use the appeal to authority that mainstream media and Hollywood and everybody is in unison.
[01:45:59.158 --> 01:46:12.048]  Doing all these contradictory things day by day, and I research the psychology behind it, they're just trying to overwhelm people and exhaust us until we accept our house burning down around us, if they say to.
[01:46:12.048 --> 01:46:15.590]  I mean, this is, people ask, why do cults ask to have sex with their kids?
[01:46:15.590 --> 01:46:17.772]  Why do cults ask you to stay on your head?
[01:46:17.772 --> 01:46:19.513]  Why do cults tell you 2 plus 2 equals 5?
[01:46:20.936 --> 01:46:23.298]  Because they want power over your mind.
[01:46:23.298 --> 01:46:26.602]  They want you to suspend logic.
[01:46:26.602 --> 01:46:30.206]  And so we, you know, those of us that still have logic, we laugh at this.
[01:46:30.206 --> 01:46:30.926]  It's not funny.
[01:46:30.926 --> 01:46:35.171]  A lot of people are suspending logic or they're just giving up.
[01:46:35.171 --> 01:46:43.059]  Paul, I mean, what do you think's behind this, the mental gymnastics we see that should totally discredit these people forever?
[01:46:44.724 --> 01:46:51.951]  Well, I think what's behind it is it's a mafia thing where you can't leave the mafia, but it's also the intimidation of the mob.
[01:46:51.951 --> 01:46:54.774]  We've seen the black squares on Instagram.
[01:46:54.774 --> 01:46:58.318]  We've seen people literally saying, if you post pictures of your food,
[01:46:59.369 --> 01:47:02.570]  On social media, then that means you're racist.
[01:47:02.570 --> 01:47:06.171]  Now posting pictures of your own dinner on Instagram is racist.
[01:47:06.171 --> 01:47:13.853]  Oh, MSNBC officially saying now calling the police is elitist and that minorities don't deserve police.
[01:47:13.853 --> 01:47:16.753]  And they're saying get rid of the police entirely.
[01:47:16.753 --> 01:47:19.354]  People are so dependent now on that.
[01:47:19.354 --> 01:47:22.535]  Liberals are the ones that call police if their Big Mac is cold.
[01:47:24.093 --> 01:47:32.035]  Yeah, so now they're introducing the idea of literally having political commissars act as the police and they're going to enforce the law.
[01:47:32.035 --> 01:47:37.657]  Meanwhile, as he said, the uniformity of opinion behind this is staggering.
[01:47:37.657 --> 01:47:51.881]  You know, they've got every major media outlet on their side, they've got every major corporation on their side, every social network, every cultural institution, Hollywood, celebrities, world leaders, politicians, governors, police chiefs,
[01:47:52.461 --> 01:48:04.333]  And they still claim, Alex, that this is an anti-establishment movement, when you've got every single tentacle of the establishment behind you, when you're endorsed by every single tentacle of the establishment.
[01:48:04.333 --> 01:48:06.575]  That's not anti-establishment!
[01:48:07.190 --> 01:48:16.360]  Like, imagine if we had Brexit protesters out on the streets of London attacking police, defacing statues, throwing missiles at police horses.
[01:48:16.360 --> 01:48:18.622]  Would they say it was largely peaceful?
[01:48:18.622 --> 01:48:19.243]  No.
[01:48:19.243 --> 01:48:22.427]  It's a complete 180 and it's absolutely incredible.
[01:48:22.427 --> 01:48:27.292]  What's going to happen, Alex, is next weekend, if this continues, which it looks like it will,
[01:48:28.369 --> 01:48:38.474]  The football lads in the UK, which are kind of the Tommy Robinson types, have said that they're going to go out en masse on the streets simply to protect these war memorials, the Churchill Memorial.
[01:48:38.474 --> 01:48:47.399]  Now, if there's any confrontation whatsoever, even though they've said they're going to be peaceful... The police are going to swoop in with helicopter gunships and fire missiles at the British patriots.
[01:48:48.243 --> 01:48:56.612]  Right-wing extremists attack minorities, that's how they're reported, even though they've literally injured 35 cops, and it's largely peaceful.
[01:48:56.612 --> 01:49:00.616]  Absolutely Orwellian and incredible.
[01:49:00.616 --> 01:49:04.260]  Paul, let's expand on what you said, because what you said is the key to everything.
[01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:07.163]  In fact, I've meant to start the show with that today.
[01:49:08.021 --> 01:49:09.542]  And for some reason I always get distracted and don't.
[01:49:09.542 --> 01:49:11.663]  What you just said is the key to everything.
[01:49:11.663 --> 01:49:32.475]  All the mega banks, all the media, all the authoritarian regimes, the communist Chinese, the unelected EU, Hollywood, the Jeffrey Epstein types, they are all in unison saying America's bad, England's bad, Europe's bad, white people are bad, cops are bad, overthrow the government, and they're billionaires that control trillions
[01:49:33.459 --> 01:49:59.534]  That run death camps in China, and have 3 million Muslims in slave camps, making Apple components, and then literally the most powerful, ruthless people on earth, that have destroyed the middle class, vertically integrated the money, like never before seen in history, are literally trying to have third world mobs, and leftist, anarchist, managers from academia, have a communist overthrow,
[01:50:01.616 --> 01:50:03.116]  This is just so insane!
[01:50:03.116 --> 01:50:08.358]  This is the elite using communism and class warfare as a takeover arm.
[01:50:08.358 --> 01:50:09.318]  Where does it end?
[01:50:09.318 --> 01:50:11.219]  Where does it go?
[01:50:11.219 --> 01:50:14.540]  What can we do to fight this?
[01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:22.742]  I mean, the reaction I've seen over the past 48 hours is absolutely, fundamentally a massive backlash that I haven't seen before.
[01:50:22.742 --> 01:50:23.102]  But again,
[01:50:23.812 --> 01:50:25.534]  What can we do in the UK?
[01:50:25.534 --> 01:50:32.500]  These same people had this same social justice, identitarian, extremist message before the election in December.
[01:50:32.500 --> 01:50:46.553]  The UK voted in droves for the Conservative Party, so they got absolutely crushed on the left, but now the Conservative Party, when this happens, when people are defacing Churchill statues, attacking the police, what are they talking about on Twitter?
[01:50:46.553 --> 01:50:48.795]  They're talking about, wash your hands!
[01:50:49.355 --> 01:50:51.637]  So it's absolute fundamental weakness.
[01:50:51.637 --> 01:50:58.843]  The only saving grace, I guess, Alex, is Nigel Farage had the support of a third of the country just about six months ago.
[01:50:58.843 --> 01:51:03.367]  And if somebody runs on a law and order message, that's going to attract mass support.
[01:51:03.367 --> 01:51:05.249]  In America, you had a poll.
[01:51:05.249 --> 01:51:09.733]  58% of Americans support military on the streets to deal with this mayhem.
[01:51:09.733 --> 01:51:12.595]  So the silent majority is still there.
[01:51:12.595 --> 01:51:14.077]  And that's the one saving grace.
[01:51:15.384 --> 01:51:22.450]  But they need to stop being silent because all of this appeasement is meant to summon something even more destructive.
[01:51:22.450 --> 01:51:26.933]  I want to do five more minutes and then we'll get back to work at Summit.News and the great articles you write for Infowars.com.
[01:51:26.933 --> 01:51:27.674]  We'll come back in two minutes.
[01:51:27.674 --> 01:51:32.718]  I'm going to ask Paul what he predicts is coming the next 147 days with Trump.
[01:51:32.718 --> 01:51:36.981]  Because I'll be honest with you, I told you Trump was going to win before anybody else did.
[01:51:36.981 --> 01:51:37.962]  Trump's going to lose right now.
[01:51:40.618 --> 01:51:44.280]  It's time to take a new, healthier approach to one of your most basic needs.
[01:51:44.280 --> 01:51:51.344]  The Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the Infowars crew use every day for the purest water possible.

[01:52:09.873 --> 01:52:12.914]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful.
[01:52:12.914 --> 01:52:17.496]  No matter what side of the political spectrum you're on, we're all feeling the strain from rising pressure.
[01:52:17.496 --> 01:52:22.598]  That's why we worked hard to create a new formula to support your fight against stress in your hectic day.

[01:52:42.252 --> 01:52:44.573]  This is the end, my friends.
[01:52:44.573 --> 01:52:46.695]  My only friend's the end.
[01:52:46.695 --> 01:52:49.257]  Of our elaborate plans, the end.
[01:52:49.257 --> 01:52:52.419]  Of everything that stands, the end.
[01:52:52.419 --> 01:52:53.520]  The safety.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:54.121]  The delusion.
[01:52:55.034 --> 01:52:57.215]  It's all over, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:57.215 --> 01:53:00.437]  Because it was only the mirage of safety.
[01:53:00.437 --> 01:53:04.079]  Movies, and partying, and living like children.
[01:53:04.079 --> 01:53:06.740]  Ever growing up, ever caring about other people.
[01:53:06.740 --> 01:53:10.442]  This delivered us into the hands of tyranny.
[01:53:10.442 --> 01:53:13.403]  Just like the history books show us, just like the Bible states.
[01:53:13.403 --> 01:53:16.425]  Every time Israel became corrupt and evil and turned away from God,
[01:53:17.403 --> 01:53:26.447]  They were brought into captivity because their people sold out to special interests and were infiltrated by spies and then they were enslaved.
[01:53:26.447 --> 01:53:28.428]  We are repeating that again today.
[01:53:28.428 --> 01:53:34.431]  Compliance and going along with this system leads to absolute bondage.
[01:53:34.431 --> 01:53:37.132]  Infowars has decided to fight for freedom.
[01:53:37.132 --> 01:53:43.956]  Infowars has had great victory thanks to your support and your prayers.
[01:53:43.956 --> 01:53:46.577]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:03.098 --> 01:54:12.481]  You know, I come in here every day, and I know that I read thousands of pages a week.
[01:54:12.481 --> 01:54:29.427]  I know I sit there and read Saul Alinsky's writings, and I read the French Revolution writings, and I read Hitler's writings, and I read Stalin and Lenin's writings, and we sat here in this bubble in what's left of Europe and the UK and the US and Canada and Australia and New Zealand.
[01:54:30.783 --> 01:54:35.307]  And we just don't know how lucky we've got it.
[01:54:35.307 --> 01:54:42.512]  And I just see, basically, it's like a planet losing its atmosphere.
[01:54:42.512 --> 01:54:46.755]  In the fables, Mars had an atmosphere once and it lost it.
[01:54:46.755 --> 01:54:47.716]  That's what the ancients said.
[01:54:47.716 --> 01:54:50.878]  The Greeks said it once and it did have an atmosphere.
[01:54:50.878 --> 01:54:52.279]  How we know this, we're not sure.
[01:54:52.279 --> 01:54:53.941]  We just know.
[01:54:53.941 --> 01:54:56.283]  Well, we're losing our cultural atmosphere right now.
[01:54:57.384 --> 01:55:00.427]  And we better get mobilized and aggressive or it's all over.
[01:55:00.427 --> 01:55:02.909]  The four minutes we have left, Paul Watson, what do you predict?
[01:55:02.909 --> 01:55:03.790]  Trump can still win.
[01:55:03.790 --> 01:55:06.172]  I'm not saying he's going to lose.
[01:55:06.172 --> 01:55:18.522]  But if he listens to the leftists and the pacifists and if he goes soft, what they're telling him to do right now, this is all a test, that he follows all the fake polls they're giving him and the fake polls his people are bringing him, we're going to lose this thing.
[01:55:18.522 --> 01:55:20.684]  What's your gut level, Paul Joseph Watson?
[01:55:22.369 --> 01:55:32.532]  Well, they're obviously trying to use the intimidation tactics of the mob to say, if you re-elect Trump, this is what America, this is what Europe is going to be like for the next four years after that.
[01:55:32.532 --> 01:55:44.896]  So that's literally why they're out on the streets to push that kind of scare message that if you do choose to re-elect Trump, there will be complete bedlam and this will become a routine thing.
[01:55:44.896 --> 01:55:51.838]  In terms of the wider perspective, I mean, you've played that clip many times before of the infiltrator of the weather underground,
[01:55:53.044 --> 01:55:59.366]  violent terrorist extremist group that bombed police stations, attempted to kill people in the 70s.
[01:55:59.366 --> 01:56:10.491]  And the infiltrator literally said after he infiltrated the group, if you don't comply their goal is to literally put you in gulags and kill you.
[01:56:10.491 --> 01:56:19.894]  Now this is not Alex Jones saying this, this is not David Icke, this was a guy who literally infiltrated the weather underground on behalf of the US authorities at the time.
[01:56:19.894 --> 01:56:21.535]  And this is what they told him.
[01:56:22.242 --> 01:56:27.025]  And if you speak to the people at the protests, that's the message that they will echo.
[01:56:27.025 --> 01:56:32.368]  You also have ISIS celebrating these George Floyd protests.
[01:56:32.368 --> 01:56:42.975]  And we had an article back, I think it was like five years ago now, where in their official publication, ISIS said, our plan, and whether ISIS is over, it doesn't matter.
[01:56:42.975 --> 01:56:44.296]  We're talking about extremists
[01:56:45.266 --> 01:56:47.007]  Infiltrating from abroad.
[01:56:47.007 --> 01:57:03.355]  It was their plan to go to left-wing rallies, radicalize and make violent the protesters, so that they would follow up these attacks on police, these attacks on media, by literally throwing explosives, throwing grenades at people and bombing things.
[01:57:03.355 --> 01:57:09.198]  Islamic State said that was the goal in their own publication, so this is where it's going.
[01:57:09.198 --> 01:57:10.738]  It's a cultural revolution.
[01:57:10.738 --> 01:57:11.819]  In the UK yesterday,
[01:57:12.665 --> 01:57:20.759]  We had a statue in Bristol, which is a city probably about 100 miles from London, not only toppled but then thrown in the river.
[01:57:20.759 --> 01:57:21.441]  Okay?
[01:57:21.441 --> 01:57:23.304]  Because it was a racist statue.
[01:57:23.843 --> 01:57:27.386]  They're going to do the same thing to people who are racist.
[01:57:27.386 --> 01:57:28.787]  Who's racist?
[01:57:28.787 --> 01:57:30.849]  Anyone who disagrees with us.
[01:57:30.849 --> 01:57:40.037]  So they're literally going to start attacking people on the streets, killing them, if we don't stop this and the media still will report it as largely peaceful.
[01:57:40.037 --> 01:57:45.722]  They'll be like, oh well, only a few people killed that person so the demonstration was still largely peaceful.
[01:57:45.722 --> 01:57:48.184]  So if it doesn't stop now it's going to get violent.
[01:57:48.184 --> 01:57:49.726]  The only positive thing with Trump is
[01:57:50.583 --> 01:58:01.798]  They had a Rasmussen poll a few days ago, which found 40% black support for the job that Trump's doing, which is up from about 28% in August last year.
[01:58:01.798 --> 01:58:04.041]  So maybe that's something to hold on to.
[01:58:04.041 --> 01:58:08.207]  But with the amount of the vociferous nature of this media propaganda,
[01:58:08.877 --> 01:58:12.319]  Who knows if we can hold back the tide, but I mean, it's frightening.
[01:58:12.319 --> 01:58:13.780]  It's absolutely frightening, Alex.
[01:58:13.780 --> 01:58:14.281]  Exactly.
[01:58:14.281 --> 01:58:16.642]  The globalists were arrogant four years ago.
[01:58:16.642 --> 01:58:17.483]  They're not arrogant.
[01:58:17.483 --> 01:58:18.984]  They're attacking like piranhas.
[01:58:18.984 --> 01:58:22.726]  So I'm telling listeners and viewers, do not be overconfident, OK?
[01:58:22.726 --> 01:58:27.309]  Because I'm not going to get up here and tell you that I think Trump right now is going to lose.
[01:58:27.309 --> 01:58:35.115]  With 147 days out, if he doesn't change course in the next couple of months, if he doesn't get hardcore and just savage the hell out of everyone, he's going to lose.
[01:58:35.595 --> 01:58:38.520]  But I think Trump will turn the corner and we should help him do it.
[01:58:38.520 --> 01:58:39.361]  And a lot of it's us.
[01:58:39.361 --> 01:58:40.723]  What are we going to do to spread the word?
[01:58:40.723 --> 01:58:42.065]  It's not just Trump to do this.
[01:58:42.065 --> 01:58:42.907]  We've got to do it.
[01:58:42.907 --> 01:58:43.688]  Paul Watson.
[01:58:43.688 --> 01:58:44.950]  Summit.News.
[01:58:44.950 --> 01:58:46.052]  Incredible site.
[01:58:46.052 --> 01:58:46.913]  Summit.News.
[01:58:46.913 --> 01:58:47.695]  We salute you, Paul.
[01:58:49.105 --> 01:58:58.773]  I had told listeners back in December that I would never go to 50% off again because our markup isn't big enough selling the products to be able to fund ourselves doing that.
[01:58:58.773 --> 01:59:06.580]  But I got to tell you, things are so crazy, the world is so insane, my gut level instinct is sell out everything we've got in the warehouse
[01:59:06.960 --> 01:59:11.262]  To make sure we can stay on air through the election in 150 days.
[01:59:11.262 --> 01:59:14.164]  Because we only got money to operate a few months right now.
[01:59:14.164 --> 01:59:16.505]  So these are great products you and your family need.
[01:59:16.505 --> 01:59:17.806]  It funds the Infowar.
[01:59:17.806 --> 01:59:19.387]  Get them all now.
[01:59:19.387 --> 01:59:20.828]  These are staples.
[01:59:20.828 --> 01:59:24.430]  Super Male Vitality, 60% off.
[01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:27.491]  Knockout Sleep Support, 60% off.
[01:59:27.491 --> 01:59:30.153]  Rain Force Plus, 50% off.
[01:59:30.153 --> 01:59:32.354]  Bio-Truth Selenium, 50% off.
[01:59:32.354 --> 01:59:34.015]  Chill Force Ultimate Curl Oil, it goes on and on.
[01:59:34.835 --> 01:59:37.097]  50 to 60% off.
[01:59:37.097 --> 01:59:38.698]  Some of these are 70% off.
[01:59:38.698 --> 01:59:39.959]  Biggest sale ever.
[01:59:39.959 --> 01:59:42.161]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:59:42.161 --> 01:59:44.222]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:59:44.222 --> 01:59:45.884]  60% off is the average sale.
[01:59:45.884 --> 01:59:52.829]  Take advantage now and fund the Infowar.
[01:59:52.829 --> 01:59:55.511]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.511 --> 02:00:00.635]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:12.032]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here now into our number three.
[02:00:12.032 --> 02:00:19.054]  I tend to open the phones up starting next segment, so stand by for that to happen.
[02:00:19.054 --> 02:00:23.775]  I only go off what I can observe.
[02:00:23.775 --> 02:00:33.158]  And that means what I can research in the news, what I can see in actual real action, also what I've experienced culturally, spiritually, and then what sources tell me.
[02:00:33.158 --> 02:00:34.559]  And when I attacked Elon Musk,
[02:00:35.464 --> 02:00:38.285]  Six months ago when he came out and said, oh, we're going to have kiosks everywhere.
[02:00:38.285 --> 02:00:39.885]  You're all going to get brain chips.
[02:00:39.885 --> 02:00:41.426]  AI is going to take over.
[02:00:41.426 --> 02:00:42.386]  Just submit to it.
[02:00:42.386 --> 02:00:44.247]  I said, well, this is horrible news.
[02:00:44.247 --> 02:00:46.007]  Screw Elon Musk.
[02:00:46.007 --> 02:00:49.988]  And I got a lot of calls from people that work with Elon.
[02:00:49.988 --> 02:00:56.930]  And they said, look, Elon's moving to Austin and Elon really is a fan of yours and you should really lay off Elon.
[02:00:56.930 --> 02:00:58.791]  I said, well, I don't go off that.
[02:00:58.791 --> 02:01:00.091]  I go off what he says.
[02:01:00.091 --> 02:01:02.492]  Elon, you know, really pisses me off.
[02:01:02.492 --> 02:01:03.312]  So I attacked him more.
[02:01:07.449 --> 02:01:10.290]  There's a way you can manipulate me and that's telling me I shouldn't do something.
[02:01:10.290 --> 02:01:13.072]  So I need to look out for that.
[02:01:13.072 --> 02:01:19.194]  But then he didn't put the kiosk out this year for the brain chips.
[02:01:19.194 --> 02:01:25.377]  He'd previously attacked the New World Order, world government, the AI gods, the post-human future.
[02:01:25.377 --> 02:01:26.697]  They raided his company.
[02:01:26.697 --> 02:01:29.018]  They tried to shut down his operations.
[02:01:29.018 --> 02:01:31.379]  They had FBI investigations.
[02:01:31.379 --> 02:01:32.240]  Soros tried to
[02:01:33.433 --> 02:01:39.115]  Didn't try, shorted the stock for a while, almost took him down.
[02:01:39.115 --> 02:01:43.236]  And then Elon started coming out, and people told me, they said, watch what Elon's gonna do.
[02:01:43.236 --> 02:01:47.017]  Watch, Elon will show you.
[02:01:47.017 --> 02:01:55.619]  And then Elon came out, and he attacked the lockdowns two months ago, that was early on, and said they were a fraud and a scam.
[02:01:57.469 --> 02:02:00.551]  And he came out against the globalists and he came out against tyranny.
[02:02:00.551 --> 02:02:09.477]  And then when Amazon banned a book by a prestigious New York Times writer about COVID being a hoax, he said, it's time to break up Amazon.
[02:02:09.477 --> 02:02:13.800]  And Jeff Bezos backed down when that happened.
[02:02:13.800 --> 02:02:15.021]  And that's my experience.
[02:02:15.021 --> 02:02:23.247]  When you actually stand up as a little guy or a little lady or a big lady or a big guy to tyranny, they back off.
[02:02:26.343 --> 02:02:31.526]  And we sit here where Drew Brees says, I don't want to kneel for the flag, I love America.
[02:02:31.526 --> 02:02:34.768]  And now he's apologizing and his wife's apologizing?
[02:02:34.768 --> 02:02:36.730]  It's all this exercise of getting on your knees?
[02:02:39.383 --> 02:02:51.589]  If he got on his knees up front, I'd know he was a slave, but now it's treason to say it's a fraud and he knows what's going on, but now he chooses to get on his knees once he got some pushback.
[02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:53.750]  You're a big star in the NFL!
[02:02:53.750 --> 02:03:02.854]  You go out there and fight men in symbolic war all day, but when the rubber meets the road, man, you're a jellyfish.
[02:03:04.557 --> 02:03:05.238]  It's pathetic.
[02:03:05.238 --> 02:03:11.043]  And by the way, I don't sit up here as a man and go, Drew Brees is a jellyfish and feel powerful.
[02:03:11.043 --> 02:03:11.583]  I feel weak.
[02:03:11.583 --> 02:03:13.845]  I'm like, there's got to be more men.
[02:03:13.845 --> 02:03:21.031]  This whole new order takeover, pedophiles going to the schools, forced inoculations that give you cancer and sterilize your ass.
[02:03:21.031 --> 02:03:25.195]  And the Chinese communists are in the Washington Post saying they'll crush our president.
[02:03:25.195 --> 02:03:27.076]  And the Washington Post endorses it.
[02:03:27.076 --> 02:03:28.878]  I mean, I feel pathetic!
[02:03:31.593 --> 02:03:41.278]  I don't feel strong that I haven't backed down, and I've waged war, and I've kicked globalist ass, because I don't think of myself as that powerful!
[02:03:41.278 --> 02:03:46.261]  It's not that I'm not powerful, it's that there's so many damn weak people everywhere.
[02:03:46.261 --> 02:03:54.506]  And everyone that keeps bowing down to tyranny, and thinking that if you grovel to it, you're going to get empowered, that's not how it works!
[02:03:56.564 --> 02:04:11.088]  They were teaching you when they were undermining the Republic because the idea of America threatened their tyranny, the idea of empowering the individual, the idea of judging someone off of what they did, not their credit score or their social score or what color they are.
[02:04:11.088 --> 02:04:13.689]  You think racism's bad?
[02:04:13.689 --> 02:04:18.050]  Social credit scores and AI tracking is a trillion times worse!
[02:04:20.697 --> 02:04:22.338]  And everybody knows it deep down.
[02:04:22.338 --> 02:04:24.540]  It's the mark of the beast, people!
[02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:31.685]  God sent his son down here to prove he could take the obstacle course before he asked us to do it, to show us how to do it!
[02:04:32.568 --> 02:04:33.909]  Because that's fair, isn't it?
[02:04:33.909 --> 02:04:34.810]  It is.
[02:04:34.810 --> 02:04:37.333]  Oh, you're so big and mighty and great and everything else.
[02:04:37.333 --> 02:04:41.237]  You put us through this to decide whether we can be with you forever?
[02:04:41.237 --> 02:04:42.458]  You're a sadist!
[02:04:42.458 --> 02:04:43.579]  That's what the Satanists always say.
[02:04:43.579 --> 02:04:45.861]  Your God puts you through this free will.
[02:04:45.861 --> 02:04:47.603]  No, God's not a sadist.
[02:04:47.603 --> 02:04:52.988]  God wants, as the Bible says, people for fellowship to be in communion with.
[02:04:53.817 --> 02:04:56.639]  Because when you're the big guy and created it all, you're lonely.
[02:04:56.639 --> 02:04:59.021]  But we got to start at the baby face.
[02:04:59.021 --> 02:05:00.803]  Think of the potential of that.
[02:05:00.803 --> 02:05:05.667]  And the devil always says, your God is a sadist and put you in this to watch all this.
[02:05:05.667 --> 02:05:13.493]  No, God gave us free will.
[02:05:13.493 --> 02:05:16.195]  And the question is, are you going to use that free will God gave you?
[02:05:16.195 --> 02:05:18.657]  Or are you going to bow down to the new world order?
[02:05:25.131 --> 02:05:32.713]  You notice that first you gotta bow your head, then you gotta bow your knees, now you gotta get on your belly.
[02:05:32.713 --> 02:05:42.535]  And the very people running the abortuaries to kill all the black people, and the very people that are the satanic pedophile New World Order, tell us that's not a good enough start.
[02:05:42.535 --> 02:05:53.178]  You gotta do whatever David Rockefeller's handlers, whatever the people he put in charge after he died, like Bill Gates, that guy literally got down and
[02:05:54.465 --> 02:06:03.290]  Performed spiritual fellatio on David Rockefeller, and now Bill Gates has chosen Jeff Zuckerberg as his new vampire.
[02:06:03.290 --> 02:06:05.651]  Because they don't live forever, but they pass the spirit on.
[02:06:05.651 --> 02:06:16.777]  So, you got the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds, they hand the baton to Bill Gates, and now they're getting Zuckerberg ready, and it's just disgusting watching them.
[02:06:16.777 --> 02:06:20.359]  And just, what's disgusting is, we're gonna take this?
[02:06:23.380 --> 02:06:25.021]  Watching men just bow?
[02:06:25.021 --> 02:06:32.727]  And then you notice when you bow, it doesn't get them off your ass.
[02:06:32.727 --> 02:06:33.928]  It makes it ten times worse.
[02:06:33.928 --> 02:06:39.833]  Because you're not bowing to all the university students that have got a worthless degree and are chumps.
[02:06:39.833 --> 02:06:41.835]  All those schmucks.
[02:06:41.835 --> 02:06:47.059]  You're not bowing to all those suckers, all those marks, all those fools, all those victims.
[02:06:47.059 --> 02:06:49.782]  You're bowing to the big fat juicy spider up the road.
[02:06:50.970 --> 02:06:59.156]  And so all this mental illness with the Minnesota mayor crying at the gold coffin of George Floyd.
[02:06:59.156 --> 02:07:05.602]  They saw that weakness and they said, now you need to tell us the police department's in our control.
[02:07:05.602 --> 02:07:07.543]  And he said, no, no, it's in my control.
[02:07:07.543 --> 02:07:11.846]  They said, that's it, get your ass out of here, bitch.
[02:07:11.846 --> 02:07:17.431]  He's the little mini man they elected to put in there for their operation.
[02:07:20.285 --> 02:07:25.009]  So here's the number to join us into the next hour, 877-789-2539.
[02:07:25.009 --> 02:07:29.992]  Any subject, first-time callers, long-time callers, agree, disagree.
[02:07:29.992 --> 02:07:32.454]  We only screen your call to say where you're calling from, what's your topic.
[02:07:32.454 --> 02:07:33.916]  877-789-2539, 877-789-Alex, or U.S.
[02:07:33.916 --> 02:07:34.336]  Country Code 512-646-1776.
[02:07:34.336 --> 02:07:39.380]  And it's all coming up on the other side of this break, but let's show this little clip before I give you some antifanous.
[02:07:51.525 --> 02:07:56.426]  Officer refuses to kneel before protesters who demand it.
[02:07:56.426 --> 02:07:59.147]  This article is up on Infowars.com.
[02:07:59.147 --> 02:08:10.209]  Besides the elderly getting assaulted by peaceful protesters at CNN, now we have an officer in MA who refuses to bow.
[02:08:10.209 --> 02:08:14.490]  Show us you're with us, they told him.
[02:08:14.490 --> 02:08:17.051]  But as soon as he doesn't bow, they get angry.
[02:08:17.051 --> 02:08:17.491]  Here's the clip.
[02:08:22.443 --> 02:08:23.083]  Can we pray?
[02:08:23.083 --> 02:08:23.383]  Can we pray?
[02:08:23.383 --> 02:08:23.803]  Can we pray?
[02:08:23.803 --> 02:08:24.143]  Can we pray?
[02:08:24.143 --> 02:08:24.483]  Can we pray?

[02:08:45.228 --> 02:08:47.689]  Can we pray?
[02:08:47.689 --> 02:08:48.029]  Can we pray?
[02:08:48.029 --> 02:08:48.309]  Can we pray?
[02:08:53.436 --> 02:08:54.316]  Freedom from war.
[02:08:54.316 --> 02:08:55.777]  United Nations.
[02:08:55.777 --> 02:08:59.118]  State Department law.
[02:08:59.118 --> 02:09:01.038]  The UN gets bigger.
[02:09:01.038 --> 02:09:03.239]  They take the police, the military, and the citizens' guns.
[02:09:03.239 --> 02:09:03.639]  There it is.
[02:09:03.639 --> 02:09:10.281]  I'm going to show you from the manual itself.
[02:09:10.281 --> 02:09:14.642]  You think you're really going to be safe when only the UN, run by communist China, has guns?
[02:09:14.642 --> 02:09:16.522]  Yeah, right.
[02:09:16.522 --> 02:09:18.223]  Well, guess what, Xi Jinping?
[02:09:18.223 --> 02:09:21.664]  You may have betrayed your father.
[02:09:21.664 --> 02:09:22.604]  I didn't betray mine.
[02:09:24.343 --> 02:09:26.544]  Because I don't come from cowards like you.
[02:09:26.544 --> 02:09:27.425]  And I piss on you.
[02:09:27.425 --> 02:09:31.907]  And I piss on Hitler and Stalin and Mao and all of you.
[02:09:31.907 --> 02:09:37.190]  And when we're done with you and all your minions, you'll know you've been defeated.
[02:09:37.190 --> 02:09:39.511]  So you go out and throw everything you want against us.
[02:09:39.511 --> 02:09:41.852]  But you're now against the Republic.
[02:09:41.852 --> 02:09:44.674]  And all you're doing is summoning your destruction.
[02:09:44.674 --> 02:09:46.475]  And you will burn in hell.
[02:09:52.961 --> 02:10:01.183]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax, and now it's the
[02:10:02.913 --> 02:10:04.774]  Race riot hoax of 2020.
[02:10:04.774 --> 02:10:08.116]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next.
[02:10:08.116 --> 02:10:14.380]  Well, I can tell you it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war.
[02:10:14.380 --> 02:10:20.203]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[02:10:20.203 --> 02:10:22.664]  The globalists are attacking on every front.
[02:10:22.664 --> 02:10:23.505]  That's why now
[02:10:24.125 --> 02:10:34.110]  More than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor InfoWars off the air because they knew that when they launched this whole situation that they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air.
[02:10:34.110 --> 02:10:38.272]  But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[02:10:38.272 --> 02:10:42.535]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever.
[02:10:42.535 --> 02:10:44.916]  InfoWars.com LIVE!
[02:10:47.082 --> 02:10:57.013]  What InfoWars has been able to do, thanks to your support and your prayers and your word of mouth, has been nothing short of historic and truly epic.
[02:10:57.013 --> 02:11:00.877]  This is the battle for the future of humanity.
[02:11:00.877 --> 02:11:07.484]  And now, open world government is being established with an endgame to depopulate the planet.
[02:11:08.204 --> 02:11:13.586]  Now, the internal operations of the globalists are being externalized.
[02:11:13.586 --> 02:11:16.187]  You must decide which side you're on.
[02:11:16.187 --> 02:11:25.131]  Living in denial, having mass Stockholm Syndrome, learned helplessness will only deliver you into misery, destruction, and finally, death.
[02:11:25.131 --> 02:11:29.673]  And this is a spiritual death we're talking about, not just a physical death.
[02:11:29.673 --> 02:11:31.234]  The delusions must end now.
[02:11:32.213 --> 02:11:34.794]  Infowars was correct about it all.
[02:11:34.794 --> 02:11:37.615]  We have come so far by exposing the enemy.
[02:11:37.615 --> 02:11:41.537]  Most people that are aware of the New World Order decide to join it out of fear.
[02:11:41.537 --> 02:11:42.878]  They are truly fools.
[02:11:42.878 --> 02:11:49.440]  We must fight this or lose our souls.
[02:11:49.440 --> 02:11:52.081]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:12:17.432 --> 02:12:21.775]  We've got some major news here breaking.
[02:12:21.775 --> 02:12:28.220]  FBI, three Antifa members arrested for looting Target store in Austin.
[02:12:28.220 --> 02:12:40.929]  Now you'll see headlines all over the news telling you that Antifa is not involved in anything because the members of Antifa are never given cards or membership except for the manager who's above each chapter.
[02:12:43.100 --> 02:12:52.785]  They're like little secret agents, but look at these tough guys and gal here that have been arrested, and that's just the beginning of this.
[02:12:52.785 --> 02:12:57.968]  And again, our government has its problems, our police have their problems like every other institution, and I want to fix them.
[02:12:57.968 --> 02:12:59.809]  I'm anti-police state.
[02:12:59.809 --> 02:13:05.632]  But overthrowing government and letting the left take over the police, they don't want to abolish them, they want to take them over.
[02:13:05.632 --> 02:13:07.413]  That's your real police state.
[02:13:07.413 --> 02:13:10.235]  FBI, three interviewee members arrested after looting Target store in Austin.
[02:13:11.598 --> 02:13:28.651]  The three people identified as Lisa Hogan, 27, Samuel Miller, 22, and Sky Elder, 23, were among a group of about 20 people who broke into a building, stole items, and damaged property on May 31st, according to KSAT.
[02:13:28.651 --> 02:13:32.734]  And that's just the beginning of the slow wheels of justice.
[02:13:32.734 --> 02:13:34.035]  We know George Soros funds it.
[02:13:34.035 --> 02:13:35.336]  We know Alexander Soros funds it.
[02:13:35.336 --> 02:13:36.256]  I've shown all the documents.
[02:13:36.256 --> 02:13:37.637]  It's on record.
[02:13:37.637 --> 02:13:38.878]  Obama's involved in it.
[02:13:38.878 --> 02:13:40.640]  The whole mainstream media has endorsed it.
[02:13:41.530 --> 02:13:45.693]  But they keep trying to say, oh, FBI says there's no evidence nationwide.
[02:13:45.693 --> 02:13:49.937]  That's leftist groups announcing that through the media and putting it out.
[02:13:49.937 --> 02:13:52.078]  Antifa is all over the place.
[02:13:52.078 --> 02:13:57.523]  I've been running into them for 20 years.
[02:13:57.523 --> 02:14:01.506]  They'd always come over and hit me below the belt when I wasn't looking in a protest.
[02:14:01.506 --> 02:14:03.187]  They'd say, we're going to kill you.
[02:14:03.187 --> 02:14:07.991]  Steve Mason, a local TV activist, radio activist, he's explained, no, that's the black bop.
[02:14:07.991 --> 02:14:09.252]  They're communists.
[02:14:09.252 --> 02:14:10.132]  They're part of this group.
[02:14:11.035 --> 02:14:13.016]  They're funded by Soros.
[02:14:13.016 --> 02:14:18.199]  I didn't know who Soros was, believe it or not, 25 years ago or so, but I do now.
[02:14:18.199 --> 02:14:19.900]  And, man, he was like, they're going to take over.
[02:14:19.900 --> 02:14:20.621]  They're the commies.
[02:14:20.621 --> 02:14:21.781]  They're the Revolutionary Guard.
[02:14:21.781 --> 02:14:22.762]  They're with the Maoists.
[02:14:22.762 --> 02:14:25.704]  And he'd been a Quaker.
[02:14:25.704 --> 02:14:27.405]  His parents had been real liberal.
[02:14:27.405 --> 02:14:29.526]  He'd come down here, gone to UT.
[02:14:29.526 --> 02:14:30.927]  Gotta see how Steve Mason's doing, man.
[02:14:30.927 --> 02:14:32.708]  That guy's something else.
[02:14:32.708 --> 02:14:36.430]  But he had been inside of them.
[02:14:36.430 --> 02:14:37.271]  Because he was a liberal.
[02:14:37.271 --> 02:14:38.992]  Until he found out who they really were.
[02:14:41.195 --> 02:14:42.856]  And since I mentioned it, we're going to go to your phone calls.
[02:14:42.856 --> 02:14:45.356]  But here's Larry Grathwald.
[02:14:45.356 --> 02:14:47.577]  Green beret, Vietnam, highly decorated.
[02:14:47.577 --> 02:14:49.018]  He was going to a major university.
[02:14:49.018 --> 02:14:51.699]  The Weathermen tried to recruit him.
[02:14:51.699 --> 02:14:52.659]  He went and told the FBI.
[02:14:52.659 --> 02:14:55.860]  They said, yeah, go ahead and get involved in it.
[02:14:55.860 --> 02:14:57.361]  The FBI wasn't completely communist.
[02:14:59.329 --> 02:15:02.010]  I brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government.
[02:15:28.314 --> 02:15:36.885]  You know, we become responsible then for administrating, you know, 250 million people.
[02:15:36.885 --> 02:15:39.189]  And there was no answers.
[02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:42.433]  No one had given any thought to economics.
[02:15:42.433 --> 02:15:44.336]  How are you going to clothe and feed these people?
[02:15:45.547 --> 02:15:57.090]  The only thing that I could get was that they expected that the Cubans and the North Vietnamese and the Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions of the United States.
[02:15:57.090 --> 02:16:04.172]  They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the counter-revolution.
[02:16:04.172 --> 02:16:14.074]  And they felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest.
[02:16:16.576 --> 02:16:26.622]  Where we would take all the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be.
[02:16:26.622 --> 02:16:30.945]  I asked, well, what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate?
[02:16:30.945 --> 02:16:34.067]  That are die-hard capitalists?
[02:16:34.067 --> 02:16:38.130]  And the reply was that they'd have to be eliminated.
[02:16:38.130 --> 02:16:43.173]  And when I pursued this further, they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people.
[02:16:44.329 --> 02:16:46.551]  In these re-education centers.
[02:16:46.551 --> 02:16:49.874]  And when I say eliminate, I mean kill.
[02:16:49.874 --> 02:16:51.436]  25 million people.
[02:16:51.436 --> 02:17:06.190]  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational centers.
[02:17:06.190 --> 02:17:09.654]  And hear them figuring out the logistics
[02:17:10.521 --> 02:17:13.123]  For the elimination of 25 million people.
[02:17:13.123 --> 02:17:17.907]  And they were dead serious.
[02:17:17.907 --> 02:17:20.809]  No place to hide a documentary in 1982.
[02:17:20.809 --> 02:17:26.414]  And they were dead serious, just like Margaret Singer wanting to abort all the quote, black weeds.
[02:17:26.414 --> 02:17:28.956]  Look it up.
[02:17:28.956 --> 02:17:34.000]  By the way, I'm not gonna do it, but you know, I could rent a bulldozer.
[02:17:34.000 --> 02:17:35.061]  And I could go down to UT.
[02:17:35.061 --> 02:17:38.984]  And I could wait till the middle of the night so I wouldn't run anybody over when it's empty.
[02:17:39.804 --> 02:17:40.304]  We're good to go.
[02:18:04.406 --> 02:18:06.147]  I don't want to run over his statue.
[02:18:06.147 --> 02:18:09.608]  In fact, we should leave it up someday and explain who he is and have some plaques around it.
[02:18:09.608 --> 02:18:12.089]  It's historical.
[02:18:12.089 --> 02:18:25.974]  But that's the type of crap that those of us that are informed have to put up with.
[02:18:25.974 --> 02:18:27.695]  You understand, ladies and gentlemen, that
[02:18:31.243 --> 02:18:34.966]  Barack Obama was trained by the Weather Underground on record, Bill Ayers.
[02:18:34.966 --> 02:18:38.168]  And his wife's first job, Bill Ayers gave him.
[02:18:38.168 --> 02:18:43.052]  Michael Obama's first job.
[02:18:43.052 --> 02:18:44.073]  And that's who these people are.
[02:18:44.073 --> 02:18:45.234]  And they think it's all funny.
[02:18:45.234 --> 02:18:49.557]  And they take our tolerance as weakness.
[02:18:49.557 --> 02:18:55.121]  And they're just here to sow deceit and dissension and evil.
[02:18:55.121 --> 02:18:58.404]  They put your ass in a death camp and work your ass to death in 10 seconds flat.
[02:19:01.513 --> 02:19:03.994]  Do you remember who they are?
[02:19:03.994 --> 02:19:07.516]  And you think about it long, and you think about it hard.
[02:19:07.516 --> 02:19:12.157]  So here's Michelle telling people, don't you just don't hashtag on Twitter.
[02:19:12.157 --> 02:19:14.178]  You get out there in the street.
[02:19:14.178 --> 02:19:19.100]  But if you're a conservative, or a Christian, or want to open your business, you stay in your house and go bankrupt, bitch.
[02:19:19.100 --> 02:19:19.501]  Here it is.
[02:19:19.501 --> 02:19:25.703]  Talking down to those people, it is up to you to call them out.
[02:19:25.703 --> 02:19:29.785]  Because we won't solve anything if we're only willing to do what's easiest.
[02:19:30.896 --> 02:19:35.898]  We've got to make hard choices and sacrifices in our own lives.
[02:19:35.898 --> 02:19:45.063]  So if you're spending a lot of time just hashtagging and posting right now, that's useful, especially during a pandemic.
[02:19:45.063 --> 02:19:47.864]  But it's only a beginning.
[02:19:47.864 --> 02:19:48.725]  Go further.
[02:19:49.781 --> 02:19:52.442]  Send all your friends a link to register to vote.
[02:19:52.442 --> 02:19:58.766]  Text everybody you know to join you in exercising their constitutional right to protest.
[02:19:58.766 --> 02:20:05.949]  Ask yourself, do you know where your polling place is?
[02:20:05.949 --> 02:20:13.333]  Meanwhile, anybody promoting Americana, anybody promoting freedom, anybody showing a cop getting beat up, you're banned on Twitter or Facebook.
[02:20:13.333 --> 02:20:15.254]  Or Google.
[02:20:15.254 --> 02:20:19.216]  And during this huge election meddling, Trump, and everybody just sits there and takes it,
[02:20:20.265 --> 02:20:25.847]  And they've got all these attorney generals elected, something like 25 of them by Soros.
[02:20:25.847 --> 02:20:37.951]  And I know for a fact they've got those state attorney generals with criminal investigations opened up on talk show hosts, you name it, trying to put everybody in prison once they take Trump out.
[02:20:37.951 --> 02:20:40.412]  It's a communist takeover, folks.
[02:20:40.412 --> 02:20:41.872]  They think you're done.
[02:20:41.872 --> 02:20:43.073]  They're coming for you and your family.
[02:20:46.224 --> 02:20:54.410]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[02:20:55.717 --> 02:21:00.441]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.

[02:21:48.643 --> 02:21:49.483]  They're crazy.
[02:21:49.483 --> 02:21:52.485]  That's a quote from the 1970s film, Network.
[02:21:52.485 --> 02:21:54.186]  Yeah, things are really, really bad right now.
[02:21:54.186 --> 02:21:55.547]  We're in global martial law.

[02:22:40.581 --> 02:22:45.265]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:22:45.265 --> 02:22:48.508]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism.
[02:22:48.508 --> 02:22:53.592]  And so, populist movements are throwing the globalists out of their countries.
[02:22:53.592 --> 02:23:04.501]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services.
[02:23:05.262 --> 02:23:13.705]  This is an attempt to have society collapse, and the globalists, as they've done in the third world, will come in and pick up the pieces.
[02:23:13.705 --> 02:23:20.327]  We must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU, openly saying, defund the police.
[02:23:20.327 --> 02:23:21.628]  The police have a lot of problems.
[02:23:21.628 --> 02:23:22.988]  We all have a lot of problems.
[02:23:22.988 --> 02:23:25.749]  But this is our government and our local constabulary.
[02:23:25.749 --> 02:23:27.830]  And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country,
[02:23:28.683 --> 02:23:32.705]  They're going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[02:23:32.705 --> 02:23:36.468]  The globalists believe communist China is the model of the world.
[02:23:36.468 --> 02:23:38.649]  And they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[02:23:38.649 --> 02:23:43.112]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed.
[02:23:43.112 --> 02:23:48.835]  Infowars.com!
[02:23:48.835 --> 02:23:51.497]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:24:02.253 --> 02:24:04.634]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:24:04.634 --> 02:24:08.977]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:24:08.977 --> 02:24:12.259]  You saw Michelle Obama saying, get out there in the streets.
[02:24:12.259 --> 02:24:24.185]  Well, we better get out there in the streets and on the cyberspace and everywhere and speak up or when they get a Democrat in, they're going to come down with both feet on us and it's going to go to civil war, physical.
[02:24:24.185 --> 02:24:30.809]  And I want to stop that, but let me tell you, when they start saying overthrow our local governments and it's foreign funded, that's treason.
[02:24:34.244 --> 02:24:35.465]  We have these laws.
[02:24:35.465 --> 02:24:37.287]  We send the cops out to enforce it.
[02:24:37.287 --> 02:24:40.069]  Then we blame them and we don't like the laws.
[02:24:40.069 --> 02:24:42.011]  You blame the legislature.
[02:24:42.011 --> 02:24:42.892]  You blame yourself.
[02:24:42.892 --> 02:24:45.014]  You change the law.
[02:24:45.014 --> 02:24:46.135]  I don't like TSA.
[02:24:46.135 --> 02:24:49.398]  The border's wide open, but they're going to grab my kid's genitals.
[02:24:49.398 --> 02:24:53.181]  Okay, change the regulation and change the law in Congress.
[02:24:53.181 --> 02:24:55.183]  Don't blame the TSA agent.
[02:24:55.183 --> 02:24:56.464]  This is common sense, folks.
[02:24:57.338 --> 02:25:02.219]  Mark in Wisconsin, 23-year veteran police officer, opinion on Black Lives Matter and where this is going.
[02:25:02.219 --> 02:25:03.339]  Mark, thanks for calling.
[02:25:03.339 --> 02:25:05.420]  Tell us what's happening.
[02:25:05.420 --> 02:25:06.400]  Hey, good morning Alex.
[02:25:06.400 --> 02:25:08.400]  How are you?
[02:25:08.400 --> 02:25:09.260]  I'm freaked out, man.
[02:25:09.260 --> 02:25:12.461]  The country's in a lot of trouble.
[02:25:12.461 --> 02:25:13.301]  Ah, you know what?
[02:25:13.301 --> 02:25:15.562]  I'll tell you this.
[02:25:15.562 --> 02:25:18.983]  First of all, I know you don't like to be thanked, but you woke me up 10 years ago.
[02:25:18.983 --> 02:25:21.863]  I appreciate your honesty, your boldness.
[02:25:21.863 --> 02:25:25.244]  I learned a lot from you and I just want to say that
[02:25:27.552 --> 02:25:32.914]  We are going through difficult times in this country, and I guess I've got a question for you, Alex.
[02:25:32.914 --> 02:25:33.554]  Why?
[02:25:33.554 --> 02:25:38.056]  We have a president that has all the intelligence that's given to him.
[02:25:38.056 --> 02:25:39.516]  He's a smart man.
[02:25:39.516 --> 02:25:40.817]  Why is he not dealing with
[02:25:41.536 --> 02:25:45.141]  With Soros and his filthy son Alexander.
[02:25:45.141 --> 02:25:50.108]  Because he's surrounded by generals that lie to him to get in and then stab him.
[02:25:50.108 --> 02:25:53.673]  The Secretary of Defense is attacking the President.
[02:25:53.673 --> 02:25:57.018]  He's trying to build a house of bricks with cow patties.
[02:25:57.978 --> 02:25:59.839]  I'm not trying to defend the president.
[02:25:59.839 --> 02:26:04.000]  If I had a crew like the president has, I couldn't turn the lights on here.
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:10.702]  And so he's just surrounded by the establishment in Washington is just a bunch of trash.
[02:26:10.702 --> 02:26:12.063]  I mean, it's true.
[02:26:12.063 --> 02:26:15.984]  And that's why they're attacking the police, because the police have problems.
[02:26:17.090 --> 02:26:18.630]  They're some of the best folks.
[02:26:18.630 --> 02:26:23.032]  Americans that care, military, good families, they care about justice.
[02:26:23.032 --> 02:26:25.493]  That's why it's the police are bad, the police are bad.
[02:26:25.493 --> 02:26:28.954]  It's that bedrock local government, local sheriffs.
[02:26:28.954 --> 02:26:33.175]  Once they remove that, they've got the top, brother, the top, the fish.
[02:26:33.175 --> 02:26:36.996]  The fish rots from the head, doesn't it?
[02:26:36.996 --> 02:26:43.738]  Well, I agree with you, and I do believe the only chance we have of changing America is we've got to start locally.
[02:26:43.738 --> 02:26:45.779]  But we've got to remember one thing, Alex, is that
[02:26:46.297 --> 02:26:49.025]  We cannot put our faith in Washington.
[02:26:49.025 --> 02:26:52.356]  We ultimately have to put our faith in Jesus Christ.
[02:26:55.260 --> 02:26:58.923]  I will take this for my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and that's it.
[02:26:58.923 --> 02:27:01.124]  I'm not taking a knee for anybody else.
[02:27:01.124 --> 02:27:05.828]  By the way, I want what he just said put on the very front of the show, when we post it to Panda Video.
[02:27:05.828 --> 02:27:09.951]  And I mean to say this every day, that the global elites are pushing this.
[02:27:09.951 --> 02:27:17.036]  This is not a grassroots uprising, and more importantly, we have to stop thinking we can fix it ourselves.
[02:27:17.036 --> 02:27:17.997]  We have to trust in God.
[02:27:17.997 --> 02:27:19.278]  Now, take action more than ever.
[02:27:19.918 --> 02:27:27.301]  And it's not that I'm arrogant against God, I just get temporarily obsessed with all the news and the facts, and I get demoralized, like, how do I beat this?
[02:27:27.301 --> 02:27:37.364]  But as soon as I open that channel up to God and say, God, tell me what to do, it's in your hands, the comforter comes, and I'm totally relaxed, and the depression goes away.
[02:27:37.364 --> 02:27:38.845]  And I should start every segment with,
[02:27:39.545 --> 02:27:42.208]  And I'm sorry to listeners who don't believe in God, if you get mad at me.
[02:27:42.208 --> 02:27:43.450]  I need Jesus.
[02:27:43.450 --> 02:27:44.191]  I'm in a foxhole.
[02:27:44.191 --> 02:27:45.492]  There are no atheists here.
[02:27:45.492 --> 02:27:47.054]  And you're damn right, brother.
[02:27:47.054 --> 02:27:48.196]  You're damn right, Mark.
[02:27:48.196 --> 02:27:51.039]  I trust in Jesus Christ, and it's God's.
[02:27:51.039 --> 02:27:51.259]  But...
[02:27:52.594 --> 02:27:57.075]  God needs us to then take the challenge and move forward with the action.
[02:27:57.075 --> 02:28:04.737]  But if we trust in God to direct us, and people have to then literally dial in, like the spiritual internet, and God will lead, guide, and direct you.
[02:28:04.737 --> 02:28:06.457]  And look, it scares the Satanist.
[02:28:06.457 --> 02:28:07.497]  I know why they run from God.
[02:28:07.497 --> 02:28:13.899]  It's incredible to get grabbed by God and to be in God's hand, but you have to do that.
[02:28:13.899 --> 02:28:19.060]  And it takes some getting used to, but at a certain point, then you get scared that God's gonna turn you loose.
[02:28:19.060 --> 02:28:19.760]  You know what I mean, brother?
[02:28:21.676 --> 02:28:22.937]  I do, and I'll tell you this.
[02:28:22.937 --> 02:28:24.938]  I'll tell you, Alex.
[02:28:24.938 --> 02:28:26.338]  I'm in my patrol car.
[02:28:26.338 --> 02:28:28.339]  I'm working graveyard shift.
[02:28:28.339 --> 02:28:32.981]  I pray several times a night for God's protection and His protection over all of us.
[02:28:32.981 --> 02:28:48.409]  And I'll tell you, I mean, I'm not in a big metropolitan area, but to see my brothers and sisters in uniform getting assaulted, getting killed for a narrative that doesn't make... It's not true, first of all.
[02:28:49.811 --> 02:28:52.452]  We're not beating minorities all over the place.
[02:28:52.452 --> 02:28:54.213]  We're not like that.
[02:28:54.213 --> 02:28:55.193]  We're family men.
[02:28:55.193 --> 02:28:56.514]  We're fathers.
[02:28:56.514 --> 02:28:57.795]  We're sons.
[02:28:57.795 --> 02:28:58.475]  We're brothers.
[02:28:58.475 --> 02:29:02.197]  We love... There's more than a hundred dead cops in the last two weeks.
[02:29:02.197 --> 02:29:05.318]  Nobody knows their names.
[02:29:05.318 --> 02:29:09.560]  And that shows, it shows it's all hype.
[02:29:09.560 --> 02:29:10.280]  I hear you brother.
[02:29:10.280 --> 02:29:11.681]  Mark, finish your point.
[02:29:11.681 --> 02:29:12.941]  Go ahead.
[02:29:12.941 --> 02:29:14.622]  I was just going to say, listen, I've been down.
[02:29:14.622 --> 02:29:15.662]  I lost my partner in 1998 to a
[02:29:17.219 --> 02:29:17.279]  I'm
[02:29:31.969 --> 02:29:37.251]  It's like they're putting a boot on the back of our neck and calling us racist when they don't even know who we are.
[02:29:37.251 --> 02:29:46.994]  Yeah, you shouldn't have to grovel to the illegal aliens and watch them prey on that community, and then when your partner gets killed, he's nameless, he means nothing.
[02:29:46.994 --> 02:29:52.515]  And exactly, you care about good people, but the lawlessness is dangerous.
[02:29:52.515 --> 02:29:55.156]  It is, but the fact of the matter is we're willing to give our life
[02:29:56.107 --> 02:30:00.388]  For people that don't even know us, because we love our communities and we're cult.
[02:30:00.388 --> 02:30:03.390]  And that's why the communists hate you.
[02:30:03.390 --> 02:30:06.170]  You know, Mark, they don't want to get rid of the cops.
[02:30:06.170 --> 02:30:07.731]  They want to be you.
[02:30:07.731 --> 02:30:12.853]  And the day the commies become the cops is the day I go to war, because they're no longer the police.
[02:30:12.853 --> 02:30:15.394]  They're now the enemy.
[02:30:15.394 --> 02:30:16.054]  I agree with you.
[02:30:16.054 --> 02:30:19.595]  Listen, it's better to die on my feet than on my knees.
[02:30:19.595 --> 02:30:21.156]  I will never capitulate.
[02:30:21.156 --> 02:30:23.276]  I will never give in to the new world order.
[02:30:23.276 --> 02:30:24.877]  I will never give in to the communists.
[02:30:25.270 --> 02:30:29.733]  They're not going to take this country because God's hands on this country.
[02:30:29.733 --> 02:30:32.495]  And let me and I'm just going to make it very clear.
[02:30:32.495 --> 02:30:33.796]  We all need to stand together.
[02:30:33.796 --> 02:30:43.263]  We need to we need to start getting out on the streets and making our voices heard, because if we sit back and we do nothing, we're going to lose this country.
[02:30:43.263 --> 02:30:43.884]  Absolutely.
[02:30:43.884 --> 02:30:44.324]  God bless you.
[02:30:44.324 --> 02:30:45.265]  I appreciate your call, Mark.
[02:30:47.023 --> 02:30:50.426]  I don't think we're going to lose it completely, but we're going to have to have a real war.
[02:30:50.426 --> 02:30:54.689]  And so, I'm actually not scared of that, but just everybody, like, the games are over.
[02:30:54.689 --> 02:30:56.211]  Party's over, folks.
[02:30:56.211 --> 02:30:58.052]  Party, hey.
[02:30:58.052 --> 02:31:00.794]  Party's over now, folks.
[02:31:00.794 --> 02:31:07.380]  All of our acquiescence, our passiveness has summoned the globalist attack, the communist attack.
[02:31:07.380 --> 02:31:08.581]  All right, we've got loaded phones here.
[02:31:08.581 --> 02:31:10.603]  I'm going to get to everybody before Joe Slinton takes over.
[02:31:11.579 --> 02:31:16.004]  Let's go to Senior Citizen in Kansas, how they organized things so quickly.
[02:31:16.004 --> 02:31:18.867]  Senior Citizen, go ahead.
[02:31:18.867 --> 02:31:31.040]  Yes, it is a privilege to speak with you, Mr. Jones, and we've been listening for about two years and we have got protection for ourselves now and also ammunition.
[02:31:31.656 --> 02:31:32.237]  And a lot
[02:31:52.104 --> 02:31:53.504]  The drug dealers and stuff.
[02:31:53.504 --> 02:31:54.625]  What are they doing?
[02:31:54.625 --> 02:31:56.865]  Because it was so quiet.
[02:31:56.865 --> 02:31:58.345]  They were organizing.
[02:31:58.345 --> 02:32:04.567]  They say, how can... It amazes me when people say, how can this group organize so quickly?
[02:32:04.567 --> 02:32:08.327]  Well, they had us shut down for over two months.
[02:32:08.327 --> 02:32:19.930]  They were planning all this and our Congress people were selling off their stocks and digging bunkers and getting ready for this thing they knew was coming.
[02:32:20.620 --> 02:32:27.943]  It's not a protest, it's a pillage of the American citizens and their businesses and this country.
[02:32:27.943 --> 02:32:30.824]  And we're so glad to have a voice like you.
[02:32:30.824 --> 02:32:33.125]  We've been run three times, Alex.
[02:32:33.125 --> 02:32:37.607]  First time we called the police, they said there was nothing they could do.
[02:32:37.607 --> 02:32:46.650]  Because of your advice and the products you sell and the things that you tell us, it's like connecting the dots.
[02:32:46.650 --> 02:32:48.011]  We're not politically savvy.
[02:32:48.430 --> 02:32:53.414]  But we understand you, because we see it taking place every day here.
[02:32:53.414 --> 02:32:58.678]  Well ma'am, let me just say, you're not politically savvy, neither am I, I'm just exactly common sense.
[02:32:58.678 --> 02:33:01.881]  You're there watching you getting robbed.
[02:33:01.881 --> 02:33:03.883]  You're there watching the corruption.
[02:33:03.883 --> 02:33:06.144]  You're there watching the preparation.
[02:33:06.144 --> 02:33:08.286]  So don't thank me, I'm thanking you.
[02:33:08.286 --> 02:33:11.469]  The fact that you're there, that you're involved is beautiful.
[02:33:11.469 --> 02:33:13.330]  And I mean, what you're saying is absolutely true.
[02:33:15.336 --> 02:33:37.070]  Well I would just like to say one thing and then I'll get off here because I know there's others that's wanting to speak and it's important that they all get a chance but just like our great President Trump who has been groomed since the day he was born and before for a time such as this, God has his hand on you also Mr. Jones and you too have been groomed
[02:33:37.677 --> 02:33:43.998]  Since before the day you were born for a time such as this, you just, uh... Senior citizens, stay there.
[02:33:43.998 --> 02:33:44.638]  I want you to finish your point.
[02:33:44.638 --> 02:33:55.340]  Hey guys, Rob Dew here with InfoWarsStore.com, and I want to tell you about something that I think has really helped me out, and I think can help you out too, especially if you have any problems sleeping, and that's knockout.
[02:33:55.340 --> 02:34:03.662]  Let's face it, our life patterns have been disrupted by this lockdown, this government-imposed imprisonment, and it has definitely affected my sleep schedule.
[02:34:03.662 --> 02:34:04.462]  But one thing that has helped
[02:34:04.462 --> 02:34:04.722]  I think?
[02:34:19.480 --> 02:34:21.421]  If you don't get any sleep, you're gonna be a grouch.
[02:34:21.421 --> 02:34:23.381]  If you get great sleep, you're gonna be on point.

[02:35:04.052 --> 02:35:05.853]  I don't know if it's going to last a day, a week.
[02:35:06.574 --> 02:35:16.858]  But we're selling out of all the major products because I kind of feel like the Titanic is sinking and we need to have the funds in our bank account to fund the Infowar into the future.

[02:35:42.179 --> 02:35:43.360]  InfoWarStore.com
[02:35:46.448 --> 02:35:49.070]  The United States is not Communist China.
[02:35:49.070 --> 02:35:51.992]  We don't have 3 million people in concentration camps.
[02:35:51.992 --> 02:35:53.873]  We don't blow up churches.
[02:35:53.873 --> 02:35:57.055]  We don't kill political dissidents and sell their organs.
[02:35:57.055 --> 02:36:02.159]  But all over the news, we see the UN, Bill and Melinda Gates, WHO, mainstream media.
[02:36:06.383 --> 02:36:13.972]  And if Communist China shoots women at checkpoints and welds people into their houses and has robots controlling people, well then, gee, we've got to do that.
[02:36:13.972 --> 02:36:19.639]  And on top of it, cities like San Antonio passed laws saying we'll arrest you if you say Chinese virus.
[02:36:19.639 --> 02:36:22.803]  Well, now Cuomo in New York's calling it the European virus.
[02:36:22.803 --> 02:36:24.525]  These people are out of control.
[02:36:27.711 --> 02:36:27.991]  We're good.
[02:36:44.952 --> 02:36:46.794]  Hello GCP!
[02:36:46.794 --> 02:36:51.399]  I do tell you not to visit Infoworld.com.
[02:36:51.399 --> 02:36:55.143]  Do not get high quality products.
[02:36:55.143 --> 02:36:58.647]  It's 60% off across the book fly sale.
[02:36:58.647 --> 02:37:00.650]  They are not made in China.
[02:37:00.650 --> 02:37:03.252]  They do not have fentanyl or lead.
[02:37:03.252 --> 02:37:06.196]  They are high quality, super male vitality.
[02:37:06.716 --> 02:37:19.853]  Knockout Sleep Support, Brain Force, Bio 2, Selenium, Chill Force, Ultima Quill Oil, Survival Shield X2, DNA Force Blues, Living Defense, and Turbo Force.
[02:37:19.853 --> 02:37:22.015]  X3 available as well.
[02:37:22.015 --> 02:37:23.838]  Listen to me, dirty Americans.
[02:37:24.378 --> 02:37:30.203]  Do not go to Infowarsstore.com for 60% off flash sale.
[02:37:30.203 --> 02:37:32.224]  You go bankrupt and die.
[02:37:32.224 --> 02:37:33.666]  You have no speech.
[02:37:33.666 --> 02:37:35.587]  Infowars is weak.
[02:37:35.587 --> 02:37:38.910]  Do not take advantage of 60% off.
[02:37:38.910 --> 02:37:40.591]  GG Pink says so.
[02:37:40.591 --> 02:37:41.872]  We heard you.
[02:37:41.872 --> 02:37:48.257]  Joe Biden good.
[02:37:48.257 --> 02:37:50.979]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:38:08.649 --> 02:38:13.512]  We're going back to your calls right now.
[02:38:13.512 --> 02:38:22.577]  But here is Rand Paul talking about the bills they're trying to pass to ban non-existent lynching, but really it just bans everything.
[02:38:22.577 --> 02:38:24.358]  Here it is.
[02:38:24.358 --> 02:38:26.759]  But I think it's incredibly important that we get this right.
[02:38:28.188 --> 02:38:35.432]  A woman in New Jersey, a black woman in New Jersey, assaulted three Jewish women and slapped them.
[02:38:35.432 --> 02:38:40.915]  It was terrible, and she uttered racial epithets about these Jewish women.
[02:38:40.915 --> 02:38:48.160]  She was charged with third-degree misdemeanor assault up to a year in prison, which actually sounds to me pretty significant for slapping.
[02:38:48.936 --> 02:38:54.458]  But she was then charged with a hate crime in addition to that, that would be four years in addition.
[02:38:54.458 --> 02:38:56.639]  So we do have to get this right.
[02:38:56.639 --> 02:39:05.623]  If slapping someone and hurling a racial epithet could get you ten years in prison, this is exactly what we've been fighting about in criminal justice reform.
[02:39:05.623 --> 02:39:11.486]  That we set up a system, we didn't pay attention to the penalties, and all of a sudden things we didn't intend to happen.
[02:39:11.486 --> 02:39:13.627]  So we have to be smart about this.
[02:39:13.627 --> 02:39:15.548]  I'm willing to pass the bill today.
[02:39:16.488 --> 02:39:26.997]  As amended, which would simply say, not that you even have to harm someone, you have to attempt to harm them, but it has to be an attempt to harm them.
[02:39:26.997 --> 02:39:34.163]  So all of the discussion about bruising while trying to lynch someone, yes, that's attempted murder and would be covered by this bill.
[02:39:34.163 --> 02:39:40.508]  Nothing in the bill would stop, would prevent the prosecution of heinous behavior.
[02:39:40.508 --> 02:39:42.009]  That's what it's intended for.
[02:39:42.009 --> 02:39:42.890]  What I'm intended is,
[02:39:44.071 --> 02:39:47.534]  Trying to do is to make sure we don't get unintended consequences.
[02:39:47.534 --> 02:39:56.842]  We've fought the battle against mandatory minimums for a decade now because we tie up people in sentencing that makes no sense.
[02:39:56.842 --> 02:40:00.845]  Ten years for slapping someone would be an abomination.
[02:40:00.845 --> 02:40:02.706]  And it couldn't happen to anyone.
[02:40:03.547 --> 02:40:08.471]  Do we want a black woman who slapped three Jewish women in New Jersey to get 10 years in prison?
[02:40:08.471 --> 02:40:11.774]  If there was a group of them, it's now a conspiracy to lynch.
[02:40:11.774 --> 02:40:13.996]  We have to use some common sense here.
[02:40:13.996 --> 02:40:23.625]  We should not have a 10-year prison sentence for anything less than at the very least an attempt to do bodily harm.
[02:40:23.625 --> 02:40:28.389]  But it's the Democrats that created mandatory sentences for black people.
[02:40:28.389 --> 02:40:30.651]  Now they just switched their target from black people to white people.
[02:40:32.108 --> 02:40:33.668]  And it's all selectively enforced.
[02:40:33.668 --> 02:40:35.609]  We are live broadcasting worldwide.
[02:40:35.609 --> 02:40:39.049]  Senior citizen in Kansas, finish up the point you were making.
[02:40:39.049 --> 02:40:42.670]  Yes, I just wanted to say, Alex, we buy your products.
[02:40:42.670 --> 02:40:43.190]  We love them.
[02:40:43.190 --> 02:40:47.491]  We want you to stay on the air because without you, we have no news.
[02:40:47.491 --> 02:40:48.992]  I'm 75 years old.
[02:40:48.992 --> 02:40:49.952]  I'm healthy.
[02:40:49.952 --> 02:40:55.393]  Thanks to your products I take daily and we love them and we buy what we can of them.
[02:40:55.393 --> 02:40:59.894]  We purchase all of them for health.
[02:41:00.530 --> 02:41:04.653]  And we pray everybody else does also that listens to your program.
[02:41:04.653 --> 02:41:06.314]  God has his hand on you, Alex.
[02:41:06.314 --> 02:41:07.855]  We pray for you daily.
[02:41:07.855 --> 02:41:13.018]  You were meant for a time such as this.
[02:41:13.018 --> 02:41:16.220]  That's why you do what you do, even though you don't like it.
[02:41:16.220 --> 02:41:17.200]  You don't want to do it.
[02:41:17.200 --> 02:41:20.983]  You are compelled by the power of Christ, Alex, to do what you do.
[02:41:20.983 --> 02:41:22.684]  And we thank you so much for it.
[02:41:22.684 --> 02:41:24.265]  And God bless you and keep you.
[02:41:24.265 --> 02:41:25.585]  Thank you, senior citizen.
[02:41:25.585 --> 02:41:26.786]  Well, that's definitely true.
[02:41:26.786 --> 02:41:27.787]  I can't control myself.
[02:41:28.624 --> 02:41:30.325]  And I don't like to, I appreciate you.
[02:41:30.325 --> 02:41:31.486]  But we're all in this together.
[02:41:31.486 --> 02:41:33.427]  We're all meant for this time right now.
[02:41:33.427 --> 02:41:35.328]  It's all true about myself and all of you.
[02:41:35.328 --> 02:41:36.549]  Believe it, folks.
[02:41:36.549 --> 02:41:44.614]  The minute you start thinking I'm more important than you are, you have to realize that you resonate with God like a plant that picks up the sun.
[02:41:44.614 --> 02:41:48.777]  And it's that opening the channel with God that is all the power we need to defeat the evil.
[02:41:48.777 --> 02:41:52.239]  All right, who's been holding the longest here?
[02:41:52.239 --> 02:41:55.581]  That'd be Pastor Sam or Greg or Bart or Alex or Lone Wolf.
[02:41:56.846 --> 02:41:57.826]  Would that be Jay?
[02:41:57.826 --> 02:42:02.648]  Let's go to Jay, and then Jeff, and then Lone Wolf.
[02:42:02.648 --> 02:42:04.008]  Jay, thanks for holding from Canada.
[02:42:04.008 --> 02:42:04.628]  Go ahead.
[02:42:04.628 --> 02:42:05.649]  What should Trump do?
[02:42:05.649 --> 02:42:08.490]  Hey, Alex.
[02:42:08.490 --> 02:42:16.212]  Looking at what the Democrats are doing, they're right now trying to get their people organized and energized.
[02:42:16.212 --> 02:42:25.455]  I think Trump has a great opportunity to tell the average American, the law-abiding American, that listen, the police cannot protect you all the time.
[02:42:25.939 --> 02:42:34.545]  That's why you guys have the Second Amendment, that you should learn to know your neighbor or, you know, build community groups and defend your home.
[02:42:34.545 --> 02:42:43.691]  If Trump says that, across America, people will come together, talk to each other, come out more like you see these videos of people protecting their businesses.
[02:42:43.691 --> 02:42:49.155]  But if Trump endorses that, he'll have a base that's organized and energized.
[02:42:49.155 --> 02:42:52.857]  And he should say something along the lines of, listen, the quarantine's over.
[02:42:52.857 --> 02:42:55.599]  These mass protests have shown
[02:42:56.061 --> 02:42:56.582]  That's right.
[02:43:18.274 --> 02:43:23.816]  And it's that archetypal image of Trump with the rallies is the main reason they launched COVID-19.
[02:43:23.816 --> 02:43:30.439]  Not just for the forced inoculation, not just for the lockdown, not just to hurt the economy, but to end us being able to congregate.
[02:43:30.439 --> 02:43:33.700]  What you said is 100% true.
[02:43:33.700 --> 02:43:35.901]  Trump must engage in bold leadership.
[02:43:35.901 --> 02:43:39.063]  He must call the whole fraud for what it is and defeat it.
[02:43:39.063 --> 02:43:40.303]  What else should Trump do, Jay?
[02:43:40.303 --> 02:43:42.964]  He should trust in the people, right?
[02:43:42.964 --> 02:43:45.005]  The Trump strength comes from
[02:43:46.058 --> 02:43:51.180]  He should have a mass rally!
[02:43:51.180 --> 02:43:59.124]  The left can all have their rallies, why isn't he?
[02:43:59.124 --> 02:43:59.704]  Exactly.
[02:43:59.704 --> 02:44:10.229]  And if he was to do that and people started to say, hey listen, I need to talk to my neighbor, people may come and shoot my wife, rob my house, destroy my property that I've spent my entire life building.
[02:44:10.229 --> 02:44:13.230]  You'll come out, you'll talk to your neighbors and tell them, listen,
[02:44:14.412 --> 02:44:24.016]  You're totally right.
[02:44:24.016 --> 02:44:27.958]  He should lay it all out and say we're having our own rally.
[02:44:27.958 --> 02:44:29.038]  And this is what it's all about.
[02:44:29.038 --> 02:44:30.119]  Jay, amazing points.
[02:44:30.119 --> 02:44:30.699]  God bless you.
[02:44:30.699 --> 02:44:32.059]  Thanks for the call.
[02:44:32.059 --> 02:44:37.122]  All right, let's go ahead and go to Lone Wolf in Portland.
[02:44:37.122 --> 02:44:38.122]  Welcome, Lone Wolf.
[02:44:40.393 --> 02:44:53.015]  Alex, uh, these jellyfish rape-like creatures have taken over the city and are now running around and telling everyone we need to get rid of the cops so we can all be convicted by Communist Youth Brigade.
[02:44:53.015 --> 02:44:58.897]  They basically run around and tell everyone that you have to prove that you're not a racist.
[02:44:58.897 --> 02:45:02.177]  Kind of like Kavanaugh had to prove he wasn't a rapist.
[02:45:02.177 --> 02:45:06.418]  They're now putting us all in the chop block and claiming that, you know, if you don't post a, uh,
[02:45:07.338 --> 02:45:12.800]  Black square in solidarity with brainwashing, basically standing cult of personality.
[02:45:12.800 --> 02:45:14.180]  You're a racist.
[02:45:14.180 --> 02:45:19.502]  This is the most bona fide pure tyranny we've seen since the Soviet Union and Mao.
[02:45:19.502 --> 02:45:20.703]  It is cartoonish.
[02:45:20.703 --> 02:45:22.143]  It is ridiculous.
[02:45:22.143 --> 02:45:24.124]  It is guilty until proven innocent.
[02:45:24.124 --> 02:45:25.184]  It is mob rule.
[02:45:25.184 --> 02:45:28.085]  It is cancer.
[02:45:28.085 --> 02:45:29.266]  Yeah, it's horrible.
[02:45:29.266 --> 02:45:35.048]  With the NBA getting ready to open and all that, I just really feel like the NFL and NBA are going full communist.
[02:45:35.558 --> 02:45:36.538]  You just said it, man.
[02:45:36.538 --> 02:45:37.339]  What a circus.
[02:45:37.339 --> 02:45:38.900]  That's why people now get it, though.
[02:45:58.393 --> 02:46:01.635]  You can't live in coexistence with big corporations.
[02:46:01.635 --> 02:46:04.678]  They're all sold out by the big banks, by the Rothschilds.
[02:46:04.678 --> 02:46:06.459]  They all want world government.
[02:46:06.459 --> 02:46:09.581]  And so, I'll never go to another basketball game.
[02:46:09.581 --> 02:46:10.482]  Another football game.
[02:46:10.482 --> 02:46:14.465]  I'm done with all of them, and I hope they know that.
[02:46:14.465 --> 02:46:18.328]  Yeah, I had two tickets to the NFL this year, and I'm selling my tickets.
[02:46:18.328 --> 02:46:26.094]  I'm not going to go there and have, you know, my skin be a badge of dishonor for everyone to stand around and act like they're going to kneel in solidarity
[02:46:26.738 --> 02:46:27.879]  And by the way, they want that.
[02:46:27.879 --> 02:46:29.260]  They want the state to be God.
[02:46:29.260 --> 02:46:36.004]  When you get in God's presence, you kneel because it's so powerful you want to get on the ground.
[02:46:36.004 --> 02:46:38.305]  This is not because the weight's so big.
[02:46:38.305 --> 02:46:38.945]  This is all evil.
[02:46:38.945 --> 02:46:39.866]  Look at this cult garbage.
[02:46:57.219 --> 02:46:59.340]  Yeah, it's so bad that it's so funny.
[02:46:59.340 --> 02:47:05.084]  Oh, but notice Nadler doesn't kneel because he runs the whole thing.
[02:47:05.084 --> 02:47:05.844]  Should be kneeling.
[02:47:05.844 --> 02:47:11.007]  His health is so bad that that guy, none of these people are just like the walking dead.
[02:47:11.007 --> 02:47:14.509]  Basically, the weekend at Bernie's all over again for all these people.
[02:47:14.509 --> 02:47:15.490]  They're the slaves.
[02:47:15.490 --> 02:47:16.391]  They're the zombies.
[02:47:16.391 --> 02:47:17.631]  They're the weak that turned over.
[02:47:17.631 --> 02:47:18.652]  Exactly.
[02:47:18.652 --> 02:47:20.313]  They just expect us to bow to them.
[02:47:20.313 --> 02:47:21.013]  Not gonna happen.
[02:47:21.013 --> 02:47:21.414]  G.G.
[02:47:21.414 --> 02:47:23.735]  Ping.
[02:47:23.735 --> 02:47:24.716]  I'm not bowing to G.G.
[02:47:24.716 --> 02:47:24.956]  Ping.
[02:47:24.956 --> 02:47:25.696]  God bless you, brother.
[02:47:25.696 --> 02:47:26.717]  It's not gonna happen.
[02:47:28.203 --> 02:47:29.804]  Thank you, Longwolf.
[02:47:29.804 --> 02:47:43.809]  Man, you know, I told the producer of the show, I said, we got a lot of great guests, but I'm the captain of this ship and I'm the one that's been getting all the guests on because I like talking to these people.
[02:47:43.809 --> 02:47:46.210]  You've got a commitment from me starting tomorrow.
[02:47:47.824 --> 02:47:49.686]  We're taking calls every hour.
[02:47:49.686 --> 02:47:51.808]  If a guest is on, they're on 30 minutes.
[02:47:51.808 --> 02:47:53.870]  Or if they're a big guest, they're going to take calls.
[02:47:53.870 --> 02:47:57.894]  We're taking calls four hours a day during my show, 11 a.m.
[02:47:57.894 --> 02:48:04.541]  to 3 p.m., because the calls are amazing, and the zeitgeist is now, and there's so many incredible people trying to get on air.
[02:48:04.541 --> 02:48:09.006]  We're going to start the next hour, do 15 minutes, and Gerald Solente takes over for the war room.
[02:48:09.006 --> 02:48:09.826]  Starts at 3 p.m.
[02:48:09.826 --> 02:48:10.907]  with Owen Schroyer.
[02:48:12.833 --> 02:48:14.053]  We're going to talk to everybody here.
[02:48:14.053 --> 02:48:19.435]  Wild, Jeff, Alex, Mark, Bill, Pastor, Sam, and Greg.
[02:48:19.435 --> 02:48:24.717]  And then, Cheryl Cilente takes over ahead of the War Room.
[02:48:24.717 --> 02:48:26.997]  I haven't plugged today because the big special is supposed to end.
[02:48:26.997 --> 02:48:28.698]  It's still up there at 60% off.
[02:48:28.698 --> 02:48:30.198]  The new sale is tomorrow.
[02:48:30.198 --> 02:48:31.499]  We sold out of most of the products.
[02:48:31.499 --> 02:48:32.059]  We'll be right back.
[02:48:34.881 --> 02:48:43.931]  The panic that has been orchestrated by the global corporatist media and the chi-coms is going to now trigger a worldwide depression.
[02:48:43.931 --> 02:48:47.916]  In fact, we're already into the worldwide depression and the death sentence for the third world.
[02:48:48.558 --> 02:48:54.444]  But it's critical to understand that the longer the shutdown persists, the worse it's going to be.
[02:48:54.444 --> 02:49:01.090]  A month of shutdown will destroy decades of wealth that's been built up in a complex economy.
[02:49:01.090 --> 02:49:09.558]  That's why we've always said it's important to be a prepper and to be somewhat self-sufficient because the globalists want to make us all dependent so that we're under their control.
[02:49:10.399 --> 02:49:12.280]  They've admitted all of this.
[02:49:12.280 --> 02:49:19.901]  So remember, how does Infowars continue years and decades, in many cases, to be able to predict things before they happen?
[02:49:19.901 --> 02:49:24.082]  Because we're following the globalist blueprint and their battle plan.
[02:49:24.082 --> 02:49:25.303]  And yes, it's dystopic.
[02:49:25.303 --> 02:49:26.563]  And yes, it's scary.
[02:49:26.563 --> 02:49:30.784]  But denying it and letting them carry it out is a thousand times more scary.
[02:49:30.784 --> 02:49:33.785]  It's time to stop the denial and realize what's really happening.
[02:49:41.408 --> 02:49:49.627]  Globalists have gotten away with their Russiagate hoax, their Ukraine hoax, their COVID-19 hoax, and now it's the
[02:49:51.340 --> 02:49:53.201]  Race riot hoax of 2020.
[02:49:53.201 --> 02:49:56.544]  We've got to ask ourselves what's coming next.
[02:49:56.544 --> 02:50:02.828]  Well, I can tell you it's going to be a bunch of big old fat mass shootings to create even a bigger race war.
[02:50:02.828 --> 02:50:08.632]  It's going to be economic collapse, China invading Taiwan, Hong Kong, you name it.
[02:50:08.632 --> 02:50:11.114]  The globalists are attacking on every front.
[02:50:11.114 --> 02:50:11.935]  That's why now
[02:50:12.555 --> 02:50:22.557]  More than ever, we have to realize they tried to censor InfoWars off the air because they knew that when they launched this whole situation, they didn't want the people's voice to still be on air.
[02:50:22.557 --> 02:50:26.717]  But thanks to you and our crew, we are still on air.
[02:50:26.717 --> 02:50:30.958]  So let's boost that transmission like the Batman signal now more than ever.
[02:50:30.958 --> 02:50:38.199]  InfoWars.com lives!
[02:50:38.199 --> 02:50:40.820]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:50:54.387 --> 02:50:57.429]  All these leftists, they keep trying to summon war.
[02:50:57.429 --> 02:51:04.754]  They don't even know how to put their shoes on.
[02:51:04.754 --> 02:51:05.674]  Ha!
[02:51:05.674 --> 02:51:10.517]  I get into a war, it's like slipping a glove in my hand.
[02:51:24.673 --> 02:51:25.493]  But I don't want to do it.
[02:51:25.493 --> 02:51:30.234]  Because you're not worth killing.
[02:51:30.234 --> 02:51:32.355]  You creatures that want to kill the unborn.
[02:51:32.355 --> 02:51:34.095]  I'm going to cover it tomorrow.
[02:51:34.095 --> 02:51:37.276]  But right now, let's go to your phone calls.
[02:51:37.276 --> 02:51:41.697]  Let's go to Wild in Wisconsin.
[02:51:41.697 --> 02:51:42.337]  You're on the air.
[02:51:42.337 --> 02:51:44.878]  Welcome.
[02:51:44.878 --> 02:51:46.578]  What's up, Alex?
[02:51:46.578 --> 02:51:50.879]  I have a extra spicy Chile Rolanos for you.
[02:51:50.879 --> 02:51:52.880]  You know how on InfoWars,
[02:51:54.171 --> 02:52:01.014]  And, uh, Rogan on his podcast talk about interdimensional cartographers and stuff.
[02:52:01.014 --> 02:52:02.774]  Yes.
[02:52:02.774 --> 02:52:05.395]  Do you think, uh, it's a question for you.
[02:52:05.395 --> 02:52:21.942]  Do you think that there are secret societies, DARPA, Intel Agency, CIA, DIA, NSA, DNI, and or even Neo Proto Cacophony groups doing more than mapping like heists, robberies,
[02:52:22.737 --> 02:52:24.858]  Or even assassinations?
[02:52:24.858 --> 02:52:26.799]  Like, what's the map for?
[02:52:26.799 --> 02:52:27.919]  What about videos?
[02:52:27.919 --> 02:52:35.523]  Oh, so you think, like, they're sending in these astronauts in other dimensions, they're not just mapping, you mean they're killing and stealing stuff?
[02:52:35.523 --> 02:52:37.343]  Well, that's the ultimate deception, though.
[02:52:37.343 --> 02:52:39.604]  Oh, you're like, you're getting this.
[02:52:39.604 --> 02:52:43.226]  You think, how do you know they're not jacking into a false map?
[02:52:43.226 --> 02:52:46.908]  Because God's not going to let us, in my experience, jack into the real map.
[02:52:46.908 --> 02:52:48.188]  Return the map.
[02:52:48.188 --> 02:52:49.769]  Return what you have stolen.
[02:52:51.577 --> 02:52:53.919]  The whole thing's a deception.
[02:52:53.919 --> 02:52:56.560]  The whole thing, just like it's a virtual reality.
[02:52:56.560 --> 02:53:10.230]  On the DMT, they're only jacking into a false reality where they're given false info and believe absolutely that they're stealing interdimensional off-world technology, but all they're stealing is the keys to their own instructions.
[02:53:10.230 --> 02:53:10.790]  Answer your question?
[02:53:21.952 --> 02:53:27.496]  I think the Satanist stuff they observe is the firewall that they can't get past.
[02:53:27.496 --> 02:53:29.618]  No, they just get the trash.
[02:53:29.618 --> 02:53:36.042]  Yeah, you know, they can never go to how you say the higher levels because, you know, they don't believe in God.
[02:53:36.042 --> 02:53:39.025]  And like you said, they're intoxicated.
[02:53:39.025 --> 02:53:49.152]  You know, if you're intoxicated driving a car, you're not going to get very far, you know, let alone trying to reach other levels of consciousness.
[02:53:51.254 --> 02:53:52.455]  Well, exactly.
[02:53:52.455 --> 02:53:57.098]  The entities manipulating us know that we're new compared to them.
[02:53:57.098 --> 02:54:01.861]  They're like sending us out as probes, trying to get through it.
[02:54:01.861 --> 02:54:08.686]  But just because we're young spiritually, we think, oh, they must be advanced.
[02:54:08.686 --> 02:54:09.347]  No, they're just...
[02:54:10.789 --> 02:54:14.612]  They're like old criminals trying to con a kid that, you know, take their first hit of crack.
[02:54:14.612 --> 02:54:17.994]  And so that's why they want instrumentality.
[02:54:17.994 --> 02:54:20.455]  They want to control things like a robot.
[02:54:20.455 --> 02:54:21.976]  People want instant success.
[02:54:21.976 --> 02:54:22.997]  That's not how the universe works.
[02:54:22.997 --> 02:54:24.498]  It grows very slow.
[02:54:24.498 --> 02:54:31.642]  And so a connection to God takes time, and building things through God takes a lot of time, and just a lot of growing.
[02:54:31.642 --> 02:54:32.843]  Like, everything grows.
[02:54:32.843 --> 02:54:36.185]  Instead, with the globalists, they want instant, one button they push.
[02:54:36.185 --> 02:54:36.946]  What does Yoda say?
[02:54:38.151 --> 02:54:42.112]  When he's talking to Luke Skywalker about Darth Vader, he goes, is the dark side stronger?
[02:54:42.112 --> 02:54:43.352]  He goes, no.
[02:54:43.352 --> 02:54:45.933]  Quicker, easier, more seductive.
[02:54:45.933 --> 02:54:49.674]  That's absolutely true.
[02:54:49.674 --> 02:54:50.454]  Totally.
[02:54:50.454 --> 02:54:51.094]  Totally.
[02:54:51.094 --> 02:54:55.215]  And I just want to say I'm a big fan and I love all your products as well.
[02:54:55.215 --> 02:54:58.796]  I've been taking iodine since I was a little child.
[02:54:58.796 --> 02:55:07.838]  It was recommended to me by, as you said, from hippies, also from like a special class, hippie teachers.
[02:55:09.058 --> 02:55:12.767]  And you know, that stuff is the stuff you have just amazing.
[02:55:12.767 --> 02:55:15.514]  You know, I've been buying it since you guys came out with it and.
[02:55:16.286 --> 02:55:19.948]  All your products are great, especially the DNA Force.
[02:55:19.948 --> 02:55:20.689]  Love it.
[02:55:20.689 --> 02:55:29.534]  It's all great products, and it funds us, and I hate to scrabble and beg for money so much, but you kept us on air under incredible attacks, and it worked, and so we're changing the world together.
[02:55:29.534 --> 02:55:30.895]  God bless you, and they are great products.
[02:55:30.895 --> 02:55:32.256]  Thank you, sir.
[02:55:32.256 --> 02:55:33.797]  The listeners don't thank me, though.
[02:55:33.797 --> 02:55:34.757]  It's sick.
[02:55:34.757 --> 02:55:36.619]  We're in this together.
[02:55:36.619 --> 02:55:38.760]  It's like a lifeboat with the passenger.
[02:55:38.760 --> 02:55:39.420]  I'm the lifeboat.
[02:55:39.420 --> 02:55:40.221]  You're the passenger.
[02:55:40.221 --> 02:55:41.362]  You're the lifeboat.
[02:55:41.362 --> 02:55:41.942]  I'm the passenger.
[02:55:43.533 --> 02:56:01.727]  I've been fighting the globalists for 26 years and the evil side of me is just so tired of waiting and I'm so ready for physical war that I'm kind of happy about how bad things have gotten because all the delusional folks that don't stand up for the unborn babies that go along with the New World Order, you're about to find out just how sick stuff is.
[02:56:01.727 --> 02:56:02.547]  But you know what?
[02:56:02.547 --> 02:56:04.108]  The average person is still asleep.
[02:56:04.108 --> 02:56:05.890]  They don't deserve what's happening to them.
[02:56:05.890 --> 02:56:06.951]  So I'm actually sick
[02:56:07.711 --> 02:56:10.774]  About what's unfolding right now, and I just want to turn things around.
[02:56:10.774 --> 02:56:11.754]  But you know what?
[02:56:11.754 --> 02:56:13.816]  I can't do that without you.
[02:56:13.816 --> 02:56:15.197]  I can't get out of this mess.
[02:56:15.197 --> 02:56:19.160]  I can't get out of this stranglehold I'm in, unless you decide to get out of it as well.
[02:56:19.160 --> 02:56:20.101]  We're all in this together.
[02:56:20.101 --> 02:56:28.688]  And so if you just realize how important you are, when you just tell people about the local radio stations you're listening to, local TV stations, when you just spread the word about Infowars.com forward slash show,
[02:56:29.148 --> 02:56:32.709]  When you just buy the products at MFORSTORE.COM, it changes the world.
[02:56:32.709 --> 02:56:36.431]  Right now we've got a special that's about to end.
[02:56:36.431 --> 02:56:38.051]  60% off across the board.
[02:56:38.051 --> 02:56:41.833]  Flash sale that funds the MFOR and gets you great products you need at the same time.
[02:56:41.833 --> 02:56:52.016]  MFORSTORE.COM.
[02:56:52.016 --> 02:56:56.938]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[02:57:02.355 --> 02:57:03.736]  That was a powerful call.
[02:57:03.736 --> 02:57:04.717]  Taking more powerful calls.
[02:57:04.717 --> 02:57:06.539]  The calls have all been off the hook today.
[02:57:06.539 --> 02:57:08.120]  They're always amazing.
[02:57:08.120 --> 02:57:09.821]  Wow!
[02:57:09.821 --> 02:57:11.483]  Ha ha!
[02:57:11.483 --> 02:57:14.465]  We're going down the line here, taking the calls.
[02:57:14.465 --> 02:57:17.248]  Jeff in Canada, then Pastor Sam in Mexico.
[02:57:17.248 --> 02:57:18.008]  Jeff, you're on the air.
[02:57:18.008 --> 02:57:20.750]  Welcome.
[02:57:20.750 --> 02:57:22.692]  Thanks for taking my call, Alec.
[02:57:22.692 --> 02:57:23.313]  Two things.
[02:57:23.313 --> 02:57:29.578]  First point, in the Bible it says that Christ was slain from the foundation of the world before the world existed.
[02:57:30.168 --> 02:57:31.088]  Christ was slain.
[02:57:31.088 --> 02:57:35.591]  So we've got to understand that Christ is the designed operating system of the planet.
[02:57:35.591 --> 02:57:37.592]  I just want to put that out.
[02:57:37.592 --> 02:57:44.695]  Second point, we've got to remember that these protesters, rioters, they're the minority.
[02:57:44.695 --> 02:57:47.396]  They're coming up, they're puffing themselves out.
[02:57:47.396 --> 02:57:51.598]  They're all totally supercharged by the big evil corporations.
[02:57:51.598 --> 02:57:52.419]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:57:52.419 --> 02:57:54.960]  These are the jokes of the planet.
[02:57:54.960 --> 02:57:55.780]  Right.
[02:57:55.780 --> 02:57:58.381]  So it shows how bad the cops are.
[02:57:58.381 --> 02:57:59.362]  They're groveling, actually.
[02:58:00.640 --> 02:58:01.161]  Exactly.
[02:58:01.161 --> 02:58:02.942]  It's mass deception.
[02:58:02.942 --> 02:58:10.828]  So I was thinking, what would be a Zeitgeist galvanizing message for InfoWars and what you put forth every day?
[02:58:10.828 --> 02:58:11.969]  And I came up with this.
[02:58:11.969 --> 02:58:14.591]  I'll run it by you.
[02:58:14.591 --> 02:58:22.077]  A picture of the earth from space on a t-shirt and then a big juicy red pill with InfoWars on it.
[02:58:22.077 --> 02:58:25.700]  And it says, herd immunity from globalist tyranny.
[02:58:25.700 --> 02:58:27.582]  Love it.
[02:58:27.582 --> 02:58:28.983]  A red pill earth.
[02:58:28.983 --> 02:58:29.784]  Yeah, sounds good.
[02:58:29.784 --> 02:58:30.084]  I love it.
[02:58:31.004 --> 02:58:34.745]  Yeah, something like, you know, we need that herd immunity.
[02:58:34.745 --> 02:58:39.546]  We need that tipping point where the good people... Well, brother, we've reached that.
[02:58:39.546 --> 02:58:41.187]  That's why the enemy launched these attacks.
[02:58:41.187 --> 02:58:43.427]  Let me tell you, we had reached the tipping point.
[02:58:43.427 --> 02:58:45.948]  But now this is their full assault to stop it.
[02:58:45.948 --> 02:58:48.828]  I know, I don't believe it's going to trigger something even bigger.
[02:58:48.828 --> 02:58:50.729]  The question is how much death is going to happen.
[02:58:50.729 --> 02:58:58.251]  Because Revelation is a first, you know, approximation, worst case scenario, you know, three, four million dead.
[02:58:59.304 --> 02:59:12.315]  Yeah, so back to the idea, I think if you come out with a shirt that people can really relate to, something that really sums up the moment that we're in, and sell it for $20.20 for 2020, and give the first shirt to Joe Rogan, and get some of your friendship capital
[02:59:28.462 --> 02:59:34.486]  Putting that out there, I think... You know, Joe's a good guy and he knows that technically I'm bigger than the Elon Musk interview because they suppress the numbers.
[02:59:34.486 --> 02:59:35.586]  They don't know that.
[02:59:35.586 --> 02:59:37.227]  And we'll see if Joe has me back on.
[02:59:37.227 --> 02:59:38.388]  You know, he said he would, whatever.
[02:59:38.388 --> 02:59:40.429]  At the end of the day, it's all in God's hands.
[02:59:40.429 --> 02:59:41.970]  But that would be a great thing to do.
[02:59:41.970 --> 02:59:42.451]  God bless you.
[02:59:42.451 --> 02:59:43.711]  I appreciate your call, Jeff.
[02:59:43.711 --> 02:59:45.132]  I'll talk to all of you in 20 minutes apiece.
[02:59:45.132 --> 02:59:47.173]  I'm going to move through these calls now.
[02:59:47.173 --> 02:59:49.095]  Let's go to Pastor Sam in Mexico.
[02:59:49.095 --> 02:59:50.115]  Pastor Sam, thanks for calling.
[02:59:52.091 --> 02:59:53.533]  Hey Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[02:59:53.533 --> 02:59:55.735]  It's been a while since we've chatted.
[02:59:55.735 --> 02:59:58.998]  I wanted to bring to your attention that the U.S.
[02:59:58.998 --> 03:00:05.264]  Department of Justice is reaching out to Prince Andrew with some forceful legal measures.
[03:00:05.264 --> 03:00:06.345]  I meant to mention that.
[03:00:06.345 --> 03:00:09.708]  Yeah, they're asking, they want him, they want him to come in for questioning.
[03:00:09.708 --> 03:00:12.491]  Well, they asked before, but he kind of slammed the door.
[03:00:12.491 --> 03:00:13.772]  So now they're saying they want him handed over.
[03:00:13.772 --> 03:00:14.713]  Here's the article, guys.
[03:00:17.014 --> 03:00:21.895]  Here's what disturbs me is the spokesperson on this was Jeffrey S. Berman, the U.S.
[03:00:21.895 --> 03:00:36.418]  Attorney from the Southern District of New York, and this is the guy who was at the helm when Epstein hung himself, Arkansas-ed himself in prison, and this guy has been involved in a lot of shady stuff.
[03:00:36.418 --> 03:00:40.739]  You know, all these tweets are on my Gospel Gunslingers thread that talk about
[03:00:41.445 --> 03:00:53.691]  Him being a Berman, the judge overseeing the case being a Berman, there being a Berman law firm in Brazil that is reaching out to try to sue China, where there's numerous Bermans involved.
[03:00:53.691 --> 03:00:57.152]  And, you know, as journalists, sometimes what we have to do is ask the right questions.
[03:00:57.152 --> 03:00:58.833]  We need to know who these Bermans are.
[03:00:58.833 --> 03:01:02.054]  And this looks like just a dirty, dirty thing, where the U.S.
[03:01:02.054 --> 03:01:06.736]  swamp is reaching across the pond to the British royal swamp.
[03:01:06.736 --> 03:01:10.318]  So we really, as Info Warriors, need to keep a very close eye on it.
[03:01:10.874 --> 03:01:16.221]  And one more royal who was recently brought to my attention is, you know, the Order of St.
[03:01:16.221 --> 03:01:24.472]  Hubertus is who owns the Bohemian Grove and the Stigola Ranch in Texas, where Antonin Scalia was Arkansasited.
[03:01:24.472 --> 03:01:28.677]  And the international protector of that order is Juan Carlos I.
[03:01:29.654 --> 03:01:32.055]  Listen on their website is the king of Spain.
[03:01:32.055 --> 03:01:37.617]  Now he's still alive, but he's abdicated and his son Felipe VI is the king of Spain.
[03:01:37.617 --> 03:01:48.960]  And every time a conservative leader gets elected in a Latin American country, King Felipe VI of Spain shows up and tries to, you know, congratulate that person.
[03:01:48.960 --> 03:01:50.981]  And then he tries to impose
[03:01:51.618 --> 03:01:53.539]  Hey Alex, it's Alex Jacobson, New Jersey.
[03:01:53.539 --> 03:01:54.179]  How you doing?
[03:01:54.179 --> 03:01:56.460]  I was looking at that one article that you put out about the
[03:02:22.375 --> 03:02:23.417]  I don't think so.
[03:02:31.983 --> 03:02:36.887]  Crimes committed by African Americans on whites is double what whites commit on African Americans.
[03:02:36.887 --> 03:02:37.267]  True, very true.
[03:02:37.267 --> 03:02:40.650]  The sad part is there's only one group in this world that really is racist and it goes to the core of their religion.
[03:03:02.259 --> 03:03:03.520]  It's the Jews.
[03:03:03.520 --> 03:03:14.407]  So you better start talking about that, because you talk about all this esoteric stuff, and you say, I don't want people running around with all this mysterious crap.
[03:03:14.407 --> 03:03:16.208]  It's blatantly right out in front of us.
[03:03:16.208 --> 03:03:17.069]  Well, it is.
[03:03:17.069 --> 03:03:19.290]  Just look who owns everything.
[03:03:19.290 --> 03:03:21.131]  It's these radical Bolshevik Jews.
[03:03:21.131 --> 03:03:22.793]  And that's where communism started, Alex.
[03:03:24.836 --> 03:03:30.881]  My issue with this is I see all the anti-Jew stuff online and they're always saying I work for Israel.
[03:03:30.881 --> 03:03:32.303]  None of that's true.
[03:03:32.303 --> 03:03:36.647]  And there are some corrupt Jews out there that do leftist stuff and I'm against them.
[03:03:36.647 --> 03:03:38.689]  But they're like Nazi collaborators like Soros.
[03:03:38.689 --> 03:03:40.450]  There's always a weird globalist connection.
[03:03:40.450 --> 03:03:43.894]  I'm trying to unify everybody against the New World Order.
[03:03:43.894 --> 03:03:47.237]  I mean, you know, there are a lot of Jews that are conservative, a lot of Jews that are Christian.
[03:03:47.677 --> 03:03:52.864]  I mean, I just don't get into black people are bad or white people are bad or Catholics are bad.
[03:03:52.864 --> 03:03:57.049]  I mean, when do you hear me say, I'll say radical orthodox Islam is really bad.
[03:03:57.049 --> 03:03:58.111]  I don't blame all Muslims.
[03:03:58.111 --> 03:04:00.173]  I think they're the greatest victim of Islam.
[03:04:00.173 --> 03:04:03.398]  So my message is consistent, a pro-human message.
[03:04:03.398 --> 03:04:05.520]  The AI is coming in to take over humanity.
[03:04:06.141 --> 03:04:08.943]  And I just see this big pushback.
[03:04:08.943 --> 03:04:14.007]  Like when I'm being censored, I see like online, good job you Israeli, we'll shut you down.
[03:04:14.007 --> 03:04:17.990]  And so many of the Black Lives Matter people have an anti-Israel operating system.
[03:04:17.990 --> 03:04:19.551]  I appreciate your call, Alex.
[03:04:19.551 --> 03:04:24.895]  I just, you know, this whole thing about going after Jews all day becomes a fetish.
[03:04:24.895 --> 03:04:26.996]  And it's a cover for the ADL.
[03:04:26.996 --> 03:04:28.578]  It's a terrible organization that I criticize.
[03:04:29.178 --> 03:04:30.819]  Their anti-free speech is very evil.
[03:04:30.819 --> 03:04:40.467]  But I'm not going to lower myself to their level and then have them trick me into attacking Jews in general so they can go shake Jews down and say, oh look, Alex Jones is anti-Semite.
[03:04:40.467 --> 03:04:42.849]  It's more sophisticated than that.
[03:04:42.849 --> 03:04:50.416]  And the precursors to the ADL wouldn't let Jews get out of Germany unless they paid certain Jewish mafia's money.
[03:04:51.820 --> 03:04:56.263]  And Dr. Steve Pchenik, who's in part Jewish, he'll tell you those stories here on air.
[03:04:56.263 --> 03:04:57.964]  That's the reality.
[03:04:57.964 --> 03:05:00.946]  There are good people of every stripe.
[03:05:00.946 --> 03:05:03.228]  And I'm just not going to engage in that type of stuff.
[03:05:03.228 --> 03:05:04.588]  I'm not doing it, man.
[03:05:04.588 --> 03:05:06.009]  I care about black people.
[03:05:06.009 --> 03:05:07.090]  I care about white people.
[03:05:07.090 --> 03:05:08.131]  I care about Russians.
[03:05:08.131 --> 03:05:09.632]  I care about Mexicans.
[03:05:09.632 --> 03:05:11.713]  I care about Brazilians.
[03:05:11.713 --> 03:05:13.835]  I care about South Africans.
[03:05:13.835 --> 03:05:17.577]  And I'll criticize the overthrow of the South African government to put communism into record.
[03:05:17.577 --> 03:05:18.918]  Doesn't mean I defend the apartheid.
[03:05:20.211 --> 03:05:23.273]  It's about really knowing the subjects here.
[03:05:23.273 --> 03:05:26.556]  And I really try to stay out of all the Jew bashing.
[03:05:26.556 --> 03:05:30.039]  You know, I don't like Jared Kushner because of the policies and the supporting censorship.
[03:05:30.039 --> 03:05:31.700]  It's not because he's Jewish.
[03:05:31.700 --> 03:05:35.843]  So, I'm against Jared Kushner because he keeps getting Trump to stand down.
[03:05:35.843 --> 03:05:38.325]  But not because Jared Kushner's pro-Israel.
[03:05:38.325 --> 03:05:39.546]  So, I'm out of time.
[03:05:39.546 --> 03:05:41.468]  I wanted to go to Bart and Bill and Greg.
[03:05:41.468 --> 03:05:42.649]  You can call me back tomorrow.
[03:05:42.649 --> 03:05:43.649]  I promise.
[03:05:43.649 --> 03:05:44.590]  You'll go to the front of the line.
[03:05:44.590 --> 03:05:46.031]  I love you and I appreciate you.
[03:05:46.031 --> 03:05:49.094]  I don't want to cut more into Gerald Cilente, who's about to come up.
[03:05:50.373 --> 03:05:52.353]  And I appreciate all your support.
[03:05:52.353 --> 03:05:55.174]  I'm here promoting a pro-human future.
[03:05:55.174 --> 03:05:57.534]  I'm here standing against the Mark of the Beast system.
[03:05:57.534 --> 03:05:58.915]  I am a Christian.
[03:05:58.915 --> 03:06:01.815]  I'm unapologetic against that.
[03:06:01.815 --> 03:06:03.855]  And is the left trying to create a race war in this country?
[03:06:03.855 --> 03:06:04.816]  Damn right.
[03:06:04.816 --> 03:06:08.096]  I'm not going to join them in what they're doing.
[03:06:08.096 --> 03:06:10.677]  Do I oppose the Bolshevik Revolution Part 2?
[03:06:10.677 --> 03:06:13.037]  Absolutely.
[03:06:13.037 --> 03:06:16.738]  But I'm not going to get on the level with the mentally ill Trotskyites out there.
[03:06:17.608 --> 03:06:18.189]  I don't think so.
[03:06:42.827 --> 03:06:45.308]  We're living in insanely dangerous times.
[03:06:45.308 --> 03:06:51.210]  And I told folks going back three months ago, I'm not buying storable food because I'm worried about the COVID-19 virus.
[03:06:51.210 --> 03:06:54.071]  I'm worried about the food shortages and the economic collapse.
[03:06:54.071 --> 03:07:01.413]  And now it's admitted that a chain reaction has begun that's already caused food shortages and the collapse of farms and ranches across the United States.
[03:07:01.413 --> 03:07:02.953]  And it's even worse in the third world.
[03:07:02.953 --> 03:07:05.894]  So I hope Trump, with his initiatives, can clean this up and fix it.
[03:07:05.894 --> 03:07:07.775]  But with the election fraud and the
[03:07:07.955 --> 03:07:08.315]  I think so.
[03:07:32.821 --> 03:07:46.009]  When it comes to regaining energy during the day, convenience is key.
[03:07:46.009 --> 03:07:53.913]  Sure, coffee, candy, and other highly sugar-filled drinks can give you a short boost, but the crash always follows.
[03:07:53.913 --> 03:07:59.776]  That's why we created a mixable energy formula to take on the go when you need a little help.
[03:08:01.497 --> 03:08:18.187]  Similar to other mix-in energy packets, TurboForce from InfoWars Life utilizes vitamins, amino acids, and extracts used for hundreds of years across the world to provide focus, clarity, and a boost of energy when you need it.
[03:08:18.187 --> 03:08:24.711]  TurboForce is certainly a force to be reckoned with for portable, affordable, and tasty energy.
[03:08:25.271 --> 03:08:32.737]  And speaking of affordable, you can even try TurboForce for a limited time at an incredible 40% off!
[03:08:32.737 --> 03:08:43.847]  Don't wait till it's out of stock again and get TurboForce right now only at InfowarsStore.com!
[03:08:43.847 --> 03:08:46.469]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:09:07.665 --> 03:09:14.269]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:09:14.269 --> 03:09:18.132]  And now, your host, Gerald Solente.
[03:09:21.129 --> 03:09:22.070]  Hello, hello.
[03:09:22.070 --> 03:09:24.052]  Great being on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:24.052 --> 03:09:28.156]  And I have a smile on my face.
[03:09:28.156 --> 03:09:29.037]  Don't report me.
[03:09:29.037 --> 03:09:30.658]  You know, you got to live in fear and terror.
[03:09:30.658 --> 03:09:38.847]  What's going on now is unprecedented in world history with this lockdown.
[03:09:38.847 --> 03:09:42.590]  You got the markets up now over 300 points as we're speaking.
[03:09:42.590 --> 03:09:44.512]  The whole thing is totally rigged.
[03:09:44.512 --> 03:09:45.153]  It's a game.
[03:09:45.609 --> 03:09:46.730]  And I'm not making it up.
[03:09:46.730 --> 03:09:48.671]  This isn't a conspiracy theory.
[03:09:48.671 --> 03:09:57.857]  The Federal Reserve is spending our money, we'll have to pay taxpayer money, by the tens of trillions of dollars to buy up corporate junk.
[03:09:57.857 --> 03:10:01.579]  So, and it's only a very few stocks that are pushing this up.
[03:10:01.579 --> 03:10:05.241]  There's no relation to reality here at all.
[03:10:05.241 --> 03:10:14.567]  Look what happened last week when the market spiked on the fake unemployment numbers that came out, and everybody that listens to InfoWars or reads the Trends Journal knows that they were fake.
[03:10:15.643 --> 03:10:16.884]  And they're much worse than that.
[03:10:16.884 --> 03:10:20.966]  And even the Labor Department admitted that those are only partial numbers.
[03:10:20.966 --> 03:10:24.488]  You saw gold fall some $33 an ounce.
[03:10:24.488 --> 03:10:26.669]  More, $43.
[03:10:26.669 --> 03:10:28.771]  Today, it's back up over $1,700 an ounce.
[03:10:28.771 --> 03:10:33.413]  It's spiked up well over $20.
[03:10:33.413 --> 03:10:36.475]  Gold's telling the story and so too is silver.
[03:10:36.475 --> 03:10:38.596]  What's also telling the story is oil.
[03:10:38.596 --> 03:10:42.899]  Yeah, the markets are up today over 300 points.
[03:10:42.899 --> 03:10:44.960]  But hey, how come oil is going down?
[03:10:45.725 --> 03:11:02.196]  And that's after this past weekend, OPEC plus, includes Russia and a couple of other countries, agreed to cut production, keep it going, cutting about 10 million barrels a day.
[03:11:02.196 --> 03:11:07.740]  So oil's telling the story that there's no recovery here.
[03:11:07.740 --> 03:11:12.383]  And then, of course, there are the demonstrations, riots, and protests going on.
[03:11:12.383 --> 03:11:14.425]  And very sad, Martin
[03:11:15.319 --> 03:11:21.623]  Gugino, the gentleman, they say, 75-year-old man that was knocked over by the cops.
[03:11:21.623 --> 03:11:23.924]  Yeah, I'm a 73-year-old guy.
[03:11:23.924 --> 03:11:25.165]  His age is nothing.
[03:11:25.165 --> 03:11:29.047]  Anyway, you see the cops brutally pushing this guy over.
[03:11:29.047 --> 03:11:39.053]  And I'm not, I am not, I am not in favor of a militarized controlled state.
[03:11:39.053 --> 03:11:44.796]  And to me, since 9-11, the police are way over the top.
[03:11:46.203 --> 03:11:48.865]  They bust your chops and every little thing around.
[03:11:48.865 --> 03:11:51.066]  Not in Kingston, by the way.
[03:11:51.066 --> 03:11:52.047]  They're great cops here.
[03:11:52.047 --> 03:11:53.428]  They don't bust your chops.
[03:11:53.428 --> 03:11:54.749]  Look at that tough guy.
[03:11:54.749 --> 03:11:56.210]  Look at these tough guys.
[03:11:56.210 --> 03:11:58.351]  Look at it, look at it, and they push him away.
[03:11:58.351 --> 03:12:01.093]  They let the guy lay there bleeding.
[03:12:01.093 --> 03:12:06.137]  This is not my America, you little tough boys!
[03:12:06.137 --> 03:12:08.698]  Look at you guys!
[03:12:08.698 --> 03:12:10.860]  We need freedom and peace.
[03:12:10.860 --> 03:12:15.243]  But by the way, you know where this story ran on the toilet paper record?
[03:12:17.020 --> 03:12:21.922]  Hey, I guess all lives don't matter to you.
[03:12:21.922 --> 03:12:28.105]  Page 26 on Sunday's paper.
[03:12:28.105 --> 03:12:31.666]  Page 26.
[03:12:31.666 --> 03:12:33.187]  Buried.
[03:12:33.187 --> 03:12:37.749]  How come this isn't, how come the protesters aren't protesting this?
[03:12:37.749 --> 03:12:39.249]  All lives matter.
[03:12:39.249 --> 03:12:42.971]  All lives matter.
[03:12:45.450 --> 03:12:47.792]  Hey, how about those Iraqi lives?
[03:12:47.792 --> 03:13:02.905]  That that other piece of garbage, murderous crap, low-life slimeball, born on 3rd base, thought he hit a home run, George W. Bush.
[03:13:02.905 --> 03:13:07.850]  As we said in the Trends Journal, one of our past issues, great artwork by Anthony Frieda.
[03:13:07.850 --> 03:13:10.632]  Dumb enough to believe the Bush's wars?
[03:13:10.632 --> 03:13:12.394]  Dumb enough to believe the COVID war?
[03:13:14.085 --> 03:13:15.546]  How about the Iraqis?
[03:13:15.546 --> 03:13:17.628]  Do their lives matter?
[03:13:17.628 --> 03:13:19.650]  Nah, he only killed over a million of them.
[03:13:19.650 --> 03:13:21.011]  Hey, how about those Afghans?
[03:13:21.011 --> 03:13:23.052]  That other war based on lies?
[03:13:23.052 --> 03:13:26.035]  You piece of crap war criminal garbage man!
[03:13:26.035 --> 03:13:30.338]  Nah, Afghan lives don't matter.
[03:13:30.338 --> 03:13:35.522]  Hey, how about the Yemen lives with our great supporters, the Saudis?
[03:13:35.522 --> 03:13:43.409]  That have killed hundreds of thousands of them, created the worst human conflict, human crisis, humanitarian crisis on earth, according to the United Nations.
[03:13:43.996 --> 03:13:48.778]  Their lives don't matter!
[03:13:48.778 --> 03:13:50.478]  Hey, how about the Libyans?
[03:13:50.478 --> 03:14:07.624]  That that Nobel piece-of-crap prize winner, Barack Obama, started, that destroyed the most prosperous nation in Africa, had more rights and freedoms than just about anybody else in that area.
[03:14:07.624 --> 03:14:09.285]  Libyan lives don't matter!
[03:14:10.484 --> 03:14:17.547]  Hey, how about Assad when you killed all those, what, 500,000 Syrians?
[03:14:17.547 --> 03:14:25.291]  Assad has to go, said the Nobel Peace Prize winner Barack Obama, who everybody loves.
[03:14:25.291 --> 03:14:35.056]  All of those little, gutless, slimy liberals with their quiche-eating grins and balsamic smiles.
[03:14:35.056 --> 03:14:37.877]  Quote, I'm really good at killing people in the book Double Down.
[03:14:39.051 --> 03:14:40.872]  How about all those Syrians you killed?
[03:14:40.872 --> 03:14:44.594]  Do those lives matter?
[03:14:44.594 --> 03:14:48.756]  The fish rots in the head down.
[03:14:48.756 --> 03:15:00.321]  And these murderous presidents that we have, and I'm totally opposed to Trump and what he's doing with Venezuela and Iran, just to make that clear.
[03:15:00.321 --> 03:15:04.723]  And I am not in favor of the military moving in.
[03:15:07.895 --> 03:15:15.378]  But how about all those lives that American military, because their president, sent them to go kill?
[03:15:15.378 --> 03:15:16.838]  Do those lives matter?
[03:15:16.838 --> 03:15:21.180]  The fish rots from the head down.
[03:15:21.180 --> 03:15:30.484]  The militarized police are just a mirror of the militarized America.
[03:15:30.484 --> 03:15:33.765]  The only thing that's going to get us out of this is a real peace movement.
[03:15:35.148 --> 03:15:38.990]  This is going to be worse than the 1960s.
[03:15:38.990 --> 03:15:42.992]  This has just begun.
[03:15:42.992 --> 03:15:53.538]  And of course you have the agents provocateurs in there, the Antifa, and others that are making peaceful demonstrations worse.
[03:15:53.538 --> 03:15:55.158]  They did it at the Battle of Seattle.
[03:15:55.158 --> 03:15:56.259]  People forget that.
[03:15:56.259 --> 03:16:00.421]  They were protesting against... Look at this.
[03:16:04.261 --> 03:16:07.502]  Look how sad we're becoming.
[03:16:07.502 --> 03:16:11.443]  The Battle of Seattle, they brought in agents provocateurs.
[03:16:11.443 --> 03:16:18.766]  There were hundreds of thousands of people that were protesting the World Trade Organization.
[03:16:18.766 --> 03:16:28.009]  And they asked them, who's guys dressed up in black that, you know, in perfect shape bashing windows?
[03:16:28.009 --> 03:16:29.089]  And that's what they focused on.
[03:16:31.292 --> 03:16:34.674]  Where are the people protesting the lockdowns?
[03:16:34.674 --> 03:16:39.877]  Where are the people protesting their loss of freedom?
[03:16:39.877 --> 03:16:43.219]  This is not my America.
[03:16:43.219 --> 03:16:44.901]  I'm on the four corners of freedom.
[03:16:44.901 --> 03:16:47.402]  That's what I own over here in Kingston, New York.
[03:16:47.402 --> 03:16:49.323]  The most historic four corners in America.
[03:16:49.323 --> 03:16:57.108]  Were pre-Revolutionary War stone buildings on each corner where the seeds of democracy was sown.
[03:16:57.108 --> 03:16:58.489]  If we don't fight for freedom,
[03:16:59.571 --> 03:17:01.832]  We're going to die for war.
[03:17:01.832 --> 03:17:05.373]  I'm tired of all this tough talk.
[03:17:05.373 --> 03:17:11.774]  I was asked, what's going to happen if somebody breaks into your building and tries to threaten you?
[03:17:11.774 --> 03:17:13.015]  Oh, very simple.
[03:17:13.015 --> 03:17:17.136]  I'll blow their brains out.
[03:17:17.136 --> 03:17:22.017]  I want peace, but I'll fight for freedom.
[03:17:22.017 --> 03:17:24.778]  Because I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace.
[03:17:24.778 --> 03:17:28.059]  And if we don't have peace, we're going to die in war.
[03:17:29.273 --> 03:17:34.755]  Civil War next, if we don't stop this madness.
[03:17:34.755 --> 03:17:36.155]  We're gonna be back in a few.
[03:17:36.155 --> 03:17:39.576]  And remember, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:17:39.576 --> 03:17:42.057]  I don't have to tell you things are bad, they're worse than bad.
[03:17:42.057 --> 03:17:42.918]  They're crazy.
[03:17:42.918 --> 03:17:45.919]  That's a quote from the 1970s film, Network.
[03:17:45.919 --> 03:17:47.619]  Yeah, things are really, really bad right now.
[03:17:47.619 --> 03:17:49.200]  We're in global martial law.
[03:17:49.200 --> 03:17:53.681]  Bill and Melinda Gates, UN operations trying to bankrupt America with their lockdown and their race riots.
[03:17:53.681 --> 03:17:55.982]  But people are coming together in this beautiful time.
[03:17:56.502 --> 03:17:57.263]  Be honest with you.
[03:17:57.263 --> 03:18:00.626]  I have decided to sell out of all the products in our warehouse at 60% off.
[03:18:00.626 --> 03:18:02.408]  We haven't done that ever across the board.
[03:18:02.408 --> 03:18:05.371]  Because gut level, I realize that we're making or breaking.
[03:18:05.371 --> 03:18:13.200]  And so the only sure bet is to sell everything we've got to make sure, in case there's total breakdown in society in six months, we still have the funding to go more than six months into next year.

[03:19:38.999 --> 03:19:48.669]  I had told listeners back in December that I would never go to 50% off again because our markup isn't big enough selling the products to be able to fund ourselves doing that.
[03:19:48.669 --> 03:19:56.498]  But I gotta tell you, things are so crazy, the world is so insane, my gut level instinct is sell out everything we've got in the warehouse
[03:19:56.858 --> 03:20:01.159]  To make sure we can stay on air through the election in 150 days.

[03:21:39.441 --> 03:21:40.902]  We're into the Greatest Depression.
[03:21:40.902 --> 03:21:43.083]  They're making this stuff up.
[03:21:43.083 --> 03:21:47.346]  They got a Phase One opening in New York.
[03:21:47.346 --> 03:21:48.106]  Phase One.
[03:21:48.106 --> 03:21:50.167]  We're going to make this crap up.
[03:21:50.167 --> 03:21:52.229]  We're going to call it Phase One.
[03:21:52.229 --> 03:21:54.190]  We're a bunch of government officials.
[03:21:54.190 --> 03:21:56.131]  Yeah, official you know what.
[03:21:57.642 --> 03:22:04.665]  Official pieces of garbage crap with no scientific anything to tell you what to do.
[03:22:04.665 --> 03:22:05.865]  Here's what we're gonna tell you to do.
[03:22:05.865 --> 03:22:11.207]  We're gonna let you open up the restaurants, but you only can see it outside.
[03:22:11.207 --> 03:22:16.169]  But you have to be socially distanced.
[03:22:16.169 --> 03:22:18.010]  Hey imbecile!
[03:22:18.010 --> 03:22:19.651]  Hey moron!
[03:22:19.651 --> 03:22:23.612]  Hey arrogant piece of crap!
[03:22:23.612 --> 03:22:25.213]  Who's making up this six feet?
[03:22:27.014 --> 03:22:29.516]  Did you ever hear the wind blowing around outside?
[03:22:29.516 --> 03:22:39.722]  Or maybe you're going to keep changing it as the temperatures change and the wind changes.
[03:22:39.722 --> 03:22:42.583]  They're making this stuff up.
[03:22:42.583 --> 03:22:49.527]  And I got to tell you, most of the strangers that I know are still believing the BS.
[03:22:49.527 --> 03:22:51.629]  Oh, we saved a lot of people.
[03:22:51.629 --> 03:22:52.949]  Oh, so many people died.
[03:22:52.949 --> 03:22:55.651]  Not, no, not so many people died.
[03:22:56.289 --> 03:23:01.534]  And don't tell me about the infection rate, because you get it and most people recover from it.
[03:23:01.534 --> 03:23:04.696]  And those are hard facts.
[03:23:04.696 --> 03:23:08.760]  I have a sister, great sister, my sister Gracie.
[03:23:08.760 --> 03:23:12.062]  She's in a nursing home.
[03:23:12.062 --> 03:23:15.765]  They called me up about two and a half weeks ago.
[03:23:15.765 --> 03:23:20.710]  She's diagnosed positive for COVID.
[03:23:20.710 --> 03:23:21.430]  And she's out of it.
[03:23:21.430 --> 03:23:24.693]  She had two strokes, you know, she's in very sad.
[03:23:25.091 --> 03:23:26.112]  Anyway, great sister.
[03:23:26.112 --> 03:23:28.473]  Couldn't ask for a better sister.
[03:23:28.473 --> 03:23:31.255]  Yeah, I call her every day.
[03:23:31.255 --> 03:23:36.759]  And, you know, she didn't know that she was tested positive.
[03:23:36.759 --> 03:23:41.483]  And because she had a private room, they didn't have to quarantine her.
[03:23:41.483 --> 03:23:51.630]  Then they called me up last week, in the last week, and told me she was tested negative.
[03:23:51.630 --> 03:23:51.930]  Alright?
[03:23:52.975 --> 03:23:56.117]  Not everybody dies from this, and here are the facts.
[03:23:56.117 --> 03:23:57.797]  Here are the hard facts.
[03:23:57.797 --> 03:24:16.947]  The slimy, gutless dictators that are running our states have not demanded that nursing homes release all of the data of who died in every state in a nursing home.
[03:24:16.947 --> 03:24:17.747]  These are facts.
[03:24:18.427 --> 03:24:25.393]  And that Low Life Centers for Disease Control and others, oh, they were the ones that said, I believe, oh, you don't have to wear a mask.
[03:24:25.393 --> 03:24:34.061]  You only should wear a mask if you're sick of doing, you know, in a hospital situation, you know, working on a patient.
[03:24:34.061 --> 03:24:36.363]  Yeah, that.
[03:24:36.363 --> 03:24:40.566]  You know when they have to report who died in the nursing home?
[03:24:40.566 --> 03:24:42.488]  As of May 11th.
[03:24:42.488 --> 03:24:43.048]  Hey, wait a minute.
[03:24:43.048 --> 03:24:44.670]  Didn't most of the people die in wintertime?
[03:24:47.048 --> 03:24:51.110]  Yeah, we know that, but that will just make that number higher.
[03:24:51.110 --> 03:25:15.240]  So you will see that the people that should have been quarantined were elderly in nursing homes, elderly with chronic disease, obesity, diabetics, people that smoke a lot and have lung disorders, because there's a respiratory ailment that knocks you out, heart disease,
[03:25:16.007 --> 03:25:18.648]  And look at the shape of Americans.
[03:25:18.648 --> 03:25:26.093]  Can't understand why so many are dying.
[03:25:26.093 --> 03:25:28.374]  But don't talk about obesity, Salenti.
[03:25:28.374 --> 03:25:32.456]  I have every right that I want to keep eating all I want, do what I want.
[03:25:32.456 --> 03:25:33.737]  You're being disrespectful.
[03:25:33.737 --> 03:25:36.318]  No, I'm not.
[03:25:36.318 --> 03:25:39.240]  But I don't want to pay for your habit.
[03:25:39.240 --> 03:25:40.701]  Knock yourself out.
[03:25:40.701 --> 03:25:43.862]  We did a trends, top trends for 20, I believe it was 18 or 19.
[03:25:46.656 --> 03:25:51.277]  America ready to explode.
[03:25:51.277 --> 03:25:55.758]  And again, that's why you buy a lot of the products on InfoWars.
[03:25:55.758 --> 03:25:57.859]  To stay healthy.
[03:25:57.859 --> 03:26:02.300]  Nobody talks about building your immune system.
[03:26:02.300 --> 03:26:03.720]  That's against the law.
[03:26:03.720 --> 03:26:11.642]  We gotta wait till you get vaccinated.
[03:26:11.642 --> 03:26:13.182]  So.
[03:26:13.182 --> 03:26:15.463]  They locked down our country needlessly.
[03:26:16.397 --> 03:26:20.600]  They've destroyed millions and millions of lives.
[03:26:20.600 --> 03:26:22.581]  The numbers are there.
[03:26:22.581 --> 03:26:25.223]  The people suffering from depression.
[03:26:25.223 --> 03:26:28.645]  Suicide rates increasing.
[03:26:28.645 --> 03:26:33.969]  Calls coming to 9-11 and other emergency numbers of people under distress.
[03:26:33.969 --> 03:26:42.195]  Because a bunch of low-life poly-tics-ians, poly-tics, many sick tics, have sucked the life out of us.
[03:26:47.757 --> 03:26:54.079]  All of what they've done, they've done without any scientific data.
[03:26:54.079 --> 03:26:56.620]  Zero.
[03:26:56.620 --> 03:27:01.181]  Story in the toilet paper record of how New York is opening up.
[03:27:01.181 --> 03:27:07.223]  A delicate restart has come at last to New York.
[03:27:07.223 --> 03:27:14.746]  Exactly 100 days after the first case of coronavirus was confirmed, New York City
[03:27:16.206 --> 03:27:30.114]  Which weathered extensive hardship as a center of the worldwide outbreak was set to take the first tentative step toward reopening its doors Monday today.
[03:27:30.114 --> 03:27:42.701]  One of the reasons why the death rate is high here is little Andy Cuomo, the arrogant boy that everybody, all those Democraps love.
[03:27:44.580 --> 03:27:51.524]  Again, the boy born on third base and thought he hit a home run would be nobody if daddy was in Mario.
[03:27:51.524 --> 03:27:53.506]  You remember what this pandemic was going to be?
[03:27:53.506 --> 03:27:56.808]  It was going to be the hospitals wouldn't be able to handle it.
[03:27:56.808 --> 03:28:03.232]  They brought in those Navy emergency ships, hospital ship.
[03:28:03.232 --> 03:28:09.436]  They turned parts of the Javits Center, Convention Center, the hospital beds.
[03:28:11.837 --> 03:28:23.767]  He took people that had COVID and that were ill out of the hospitals and that were elderly and put them in nursing homes.
[03:28:23.767 --> 03:28:28.111]  Got it?
[03:28:28.111 --> 03:28:30.873]  They didn't use that ship.
[03:28:30.873 --> 03:28:33.976]  They didn't use the Javits Center.
[03:28:33.976 --> 03:28:36.598]  All over the state, everybody freaking out.
[03:28:41.345 --> 03:28:44.147]  And it never happened.
[03:28:44.147 --> 03:28:47.710]  And it's like that in every state.
[03:28:47.710 --> 03:28:51.253]  We are going into the greatest depression.
[03:28:51.253 --> 03:28:59.280]  And as the economy goes down, you know what I say, when people lose everything and have nothing left to lose, they lose it.
[03:28:59.280 --> 03:29:02.202]  And the losers are going to lose it first.
[03:29:02.202 --> 03:29:05.925]  Robbing, looting.
[03:29:05.925 --> 03:29:08.367]  One after another.
[03:29:08.367 --> 03:29:10.749]  And the more they do it, the more they're going to crack down on us.
[03:29:13.049 --> 03:29:15.531]  We need a new direction.
[03:29:15.531 --> 03:29:19.854]  And it's not with the two political parties.
[03:29:19.854 --> 03:29:22.597]  New York City's all boarded up.
[03:29:22.597 --> 03:29:27.841]  Tiffany's boarded up.
[03:29:27.841 --> 03:29:28.861]  Oh, it's coming back.
[03:29:28.861 --> 03:29:30.923]  It's coming back.
[03:29:30.923 --> 03:29:32.925]  Yeah, it's coming back.
[03:29:32.925 --> 03:29:34.686]  Here, don't believe me?
[03:29:34.686 --> 03:29:38.189]  How about arrogant Andy?
[03:29:38.189 --> 03:29:40.751]  You want to talk about a turnaround?
[03:29:40.751 --> 03:29:42.032]  This one, my friends,
[03:29:43.118 --> 03:29:47.561]  is going to go in the history books.
[03:29:47.561 --> 03:29:50.502]  I'm not your friend!
[03:29:50.502 --> 03:29:52.904]  You disgust me!
[03:29:52.904 --> 03:30:03.150]  You're an arrogant dictator who made up laws in early March to give yourself the supreme authority to rule over us!
[03:30:03.150 --> 03:30:04.751]  You don't rule over me!
[03:30:04.751 --> 03:30:06.932]  You don't rule over me!
[03:30:07.839 --> 03:30:25.150]  Come here, boy, and try to put a mask on me, man to man, and leave your tough boys behind like the guys that beat up that poor man in Buffalo.
[03:30:25.150 --> 03:30:27.171]  And we hear nothing about him.
[03:30:27.171 --> 03:30:31.294]  How come?
[03:30:31.294 --> 03:30:31.774]  How come?
[03:30:36.784 --> 03:30:39.025]  All lives matter.

[03:32:12.575 --> 03:32:14.737]  X3 available as well.

[03:32:16.497 --> 03:32:22.941]  Do not go to InfoWarsStore.com for 60% off flash sale.
[03:32:22.941 --> 03:32:24.961]  You go bankrupt and die.
[03:32:24.961 --> 03:32:26.402]  You have no speech.
[03:32:26.402 --> 03:32:27.803]  InfoWars is weak.
[03:32:28.303 --> 03:32:29.865]  Do not take advantage of 60% off!
[03:32:29.865 --> 03:32:30.026]  G.G.
[03:32:30.026 --> 03:32:30.726]  Pink says so!
[03:32:30.726 --> 03:32:31.507]  Oh, we hurt you!
[03:32:31.507 --> 03:32:32.348]  Oh, Joe Biden good!
[03:32:38.689 --> 03:32:45.032]  I don't like coming to you every day on the radio and TV stations that you watch and listen to us on and telling you all these horrible things.
[03:32:45.032 --> 03:32:49.173]  But you notice, almost everything we've talked about, horrible, has come true.
[03:32:49.173 --> 03:32:52.975]  We were warning everybody to try to stop it.
[03:32:52.975 --> 03:33:00.398]  It's like telling somebody if you got a pool, put a fence around it if you have little kids, because even if they're good swimmers, they can hit their head and drown.
[03:33:00.398 --> 03:33:02.699]  People don't listen, they go out and their kid's dead in the pool.
[03:33:03.519 --> 03:33:07.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the death of the third world and the collapse of the first world.
[03:33:07.660 --> 03:33:14.122]  And this is 21st century warfare carried out by the globalists, and they admit they've orchestrated it.
[03:33:14.122 --> 03:33:23.485]  They admit it's, quote, good to save the earth, and they're teaching us to be more frugal, and they want to make us poor so they can dictate our surrender to this post-human technocracy.
[03:33:24.165 --> 03:33:31.631]  I know all this sounds insane when I was talking about it 25 years ago, but now it's public because it's their operations manual.
[03:33:31.631 --> 03:33:37.737]  I wish this wasn't the case, but there really are evil psychopaths in control of most major institutions and we've got to stop them.
[03:33:38.683 --> 03:33:46.989]  The people of the world have awakened to globalism and so populist movements are throwing the globalists out of their countries.
[03:33:46.989 --> 03:33:57.918]  That's why the New World Order is instituting race war and division and telling the people that rebellion is about overthrowing your local police and government and destroying essential services.
[03:33:58.678 --> 03:34:07.126]  This is an attempt to have society collapse, and the globalists, as they've done in the third world, will come in and pick up the pieces.
[03:34:07.126 --> 03:34:13.732]  We must stand against the UN, the IMF, the World Bank, and the EU, openly saying, defund the police.
[03:34:13.732 --> 03:34:15.054]  The police have a lot of problems.
[03:34:15.054 --> 03:34:16.415]  We all have a lot of problems.
[03:34:16.415 --> 03:34:19.178]  But this is our government and our local constabulary.
[03:34:19.178 --> 03:34:21.239]  And believe me, once the globalists have overthrown this country,
[03:34:22.093 --> 03:34:26.117]  They're going to put in a real police state where you have no due process or freedom.
[03:34:26.117 --> 03:34:29.901]  The globalists believe Communist China is the model of the world.
[03:34:29.901 --> 03:34:32.063]  And they are orchestrating this entire thing.
[03:34:32.063 --> 03:34:36.527]  The people helping them are collaborators and are idiots and must be opposed.
[03:34:36.527 --> 03:34:42.353]  Infowars.com!

[03:35:25.948 --> 03:35:26.048]  And

[03:36:50.839 --> 03:36:51.259]  And again,
[03:36:51.826 --> 03:36:56.189]  If we don't unite, we're going down.
[03:36:56.189 --> 03:37:00.813]  You know, I'm not in favor of bringing the military in like Trump had mentioned.
[03:37:00.813 --> 03:37:04.315]  But you know what people are forgetting?
[03:37:04.315 --> 03:37:17.685]  The Nobel Peace of Crap Prize winner, folks, you know that Barack Obama who kept folks in us all the time, he signed the National Defense Authorization Act.
[03:37:20.874 --> 03:37:32.156]  On New Year's Eve, 2011, that repealed the Posse Comitatus Act of 1687.
[03:37:32.156 --> 03:37:43.739]  That prevented the military from coming in and controlling the nation.
[03:37:43.739 --> 03:37:48.040]  It was a major story in a trends journal
[03:37:49.551 --> 03:37:53.713]  The winter edition, it's when the journal used to be a monthly.
[03:37:53.713 --> 03:37:55.054]  Excuse me, a quarterly.
[03:37:55.054 --> 03:37:59.275]  Then it went to a monthly, and now of course it's a weekly.
[03:37:59.275 --> 03:38:05.118]  And the story that we wrote, we called it Battlefield America.
[03:38:05.118 --> 03:38:07.579]  Martial law in the USA, can it happen?
[03:38:07.579 --> 03:38:09.000]  It's happened.
[03:38:09.000 --> 03:38:16.823]  America has been decreed a war zone in which military rule can replace civilian rule.
[03:38:16.823 --> 03:38:17.784]  And I'm making this up.
[03:38:20.532 --> 03:38:40.360]  On December 1, 2011, the United States Senate voted 93-7 to pass into law the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012, a law that effectively strips Americans of their Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights.
[03:38:40.360 --> 03:38:42.661]  We go on to write about all the details in here.
[03:38:44.409 --> 03:39:00.199]  And he got a quote by another piece of low-life garbage crap, like how can any person with a brain bigger than a pea listen to this piece of crap that the media loves and they keep bringing them out there, going back to then and still now.
[03:39:00.199 --> 03:39:03.100]  Little Lindsey Graham.
[03:39:03.100 --> 03:39:07.603]  We go, he made it crystal clear that quote, you ready?
[03:39:07.603 --> 03:39:12.166]  The statement of authority to detain
[03:39:13.038 --> 03:39:27.363]  Does apply to American citizens, and it designates the world as a battlefield, including the homeland.
[03:39:27.363 --> 03:39:39.546]  Obama signed this in New Year's Eve, when no one was paying attention.
[03:39:39.546 --> 03:39:41.227]  No peep from the prostitutes.
[03:39:44.926 --> 03:39:57.016]  What should have been extra, extra, read all about it, with headlines blaring, President granted dictatorial powers, Bill of Rights repealed, barely made the media.
[03:39:57.016 --> 03:40:05.182]  The New York Times, self-proclaimed newspaper of record, relegated the story to the bottom, you ready for this?
[03:40:05.182 --> 03:40:10.046]  Of page A31.
[03:40:10.046 --> 03:40:11.988]  Under the Who Gives a Damn headline,
[03:40:13.860 --> 03:40:20.124]  662 billion military bill is approved by Congress.
[03:40:20.124 --> 03:40:42.738]  For the rest of the so-called liberal mainstream media, it was mostly silence and hardly noticed by its normally vocal lefty chorus, who along with the lefties on the street would have been shouting, screaming, and bush bashing had it been the former Republican president advocating for this
[03:40:43.857 --> 03:40:47.939]  Bill of No Rights.
[03:40:47.939 --> 03:41:10.428]  But the spineless, gutless, tree-hugging, non-violent, key-sheeting, intellectually superior liberals, still blindly devoted to Obama, conjured up endless excuses when he took actions that out-bushed arch-villain George W. Bush.
[03:41:10.428 --> 03:41:11.589]  Rather than acknowledge
[03:41:12.196 --> 03:41:24.841]  That the hero-in-chief was a traitor to the country, a liar and betrayer of his stated principles, the lefties refused to face the facts.
[03:41:24.841 --> 03:41:39.427]  And the fact is, the Obama administration threatened to veto the legislation if it did not explicitly include language to permit, you ready for this?
[03:41:39.427 --> 03:41:41.868]  The indefinite detention
[03:41:42.850 --> 03:41:46.673]  Of American citizens.
[03:41:46.673 --> 03:42:03.808]  As for the general public, this day of infamy was dominated by breaking news that Britney Spears got engaged in, quote, judge orders trial for two Penn State officials.
[03:42:03.808 --> 03:42:06.690]  You can see where we're going.
[03:42:06.690 --> 03:42:09.593]  This thing is going down.
[03:42:09.593 --> 03:42:10.494]  They're dividing us.
[03:42:13.953 --> 03:42:16.134]  Yes, Black Lives Matter.
[03:42:16.134 --> 03:42:18.455]  Disgusting what the cops did.
[03:42:18.455 --> 03:42:23.157]  All in favor of no police brutality.
[03:42:23.157 --> 03:42:25.037]  Yeah, you kill somebody if they're threatening you.
[03:42:25.037 --> 03:42:29.139]  If somebody tries to threaten me, if I feel my life is in danger, I'll kill them.
[03:42:29.139 --> 03:42:35.602]  I'll do everything I can to take the cat or kitten out if my life is on the line.
[03:42:35.602 --> 03:42:41.904]  But come on, you're arresting a guy for fraudulently spending a $20 bill, a fake $20 bill, maybe?
[03:42:44.673 --> 03:43:04.990]  While you bow down to the JP Morgan chases, and the Wells Fargoes, and the Citigroups, who steal trillions from us, yes sir them!
[03:43:04.990 --> 03:43:10.095]  All lives matter, and we have to unite for peace.
[03:43:14.099 --> 03:43:17.560]  This is going to be out of control.
[03:43:17.560 --> 03:43:22.782]  And the more out of control it gets, the more they're going to crack down militarily.
[03:43:22.782 --> 03:43:28.864]  And there's that guy over there also, another phony.
[03:43:28.864 --> 03:43:32.365]  That guy, uh, Wolf.
[03:43:32.365 --> 03:43:33.725]  Wolf in sheep's clothing.
[03:43:33.725 --> 03:43:35.446]  Puppy dog over there.
[03:43:35.446 --> 03:43:36.266]  In Pennsylvania.
[03:43:36.266 --> 03:43:41.387]  And all these other little clown tough boys and girls.
[03:43:41.387 --> 03:43:42.908]  You don't have to social distance
[03:43:43.490 --> 03:43:45.571]  When you march with them.
[03:43:45.571 --> 03:43:47.593]  But you have to social distance everywhere.
[03:43:47.593 --> 03:43:50.555]  There is Clown Boy Wolf.
[03:43:50.555 --> 03:43:51.916]  Wolf.
[03:43:51.916 --> 03:43:53.457]  Tommy Boy.
[03:43:53.457 --> 03:43:54.858]  Marching.
[03:43:54.858 --> 03:43:56.759]  Shoulder to shoulder with other people.
[03:43:56.759 --> 03:43:59.841]  That's okay.
[03:43:59.841 --> 03:44:03.343]  But if you're going out and having a good time, or a bad time.
[03:44:03.343 --> 03:44:06.546]  Can't go to a funeral with X amount of people.
[03:44:06.546 --> 03:44:09.147]  No weddings allowed.
[03:44:09.147 --> 03:44:10.809]  Then they'll send the cops in maybe.
[03:44:10.809 --> 03:44:12.590]  They beat you up and put you down.
[03:44:13.300 --> 03:44:15.861]  But when the slimers do it, it's okay.
[03:44:15.861 --> 03:44:22.484]  A slimy piece of wolf crap right out of you-know-what.
[03:44:22.484 --> 03:44:24.585]  Okay for him.
[03:44:24.585 --> 03:44:26.666]  Okay for the rest.
[03:44:26.666 --> 03:44:29.167]  But not okay for me and you.
[03:44:29.167 --> 03:44:36.630]  We are only the little workers of Slavelandia.
[03:44:36.630 --> 03:44:40.632]  To obey our low-life leaders, how low can you go?
[03:44:40.632 --> 03:44:40.712]  Wolf.
[03:44:43.379 --> 03:44:45.180]  Whitmer, one after another.
[03:44:45.180 --> 03:44:48.322]  Gruesome Newsome.
[03:44:48.322 --> 03:44:51.684]  Cuomo, the king.
[03:44:51.684 --> 03:44:52.945]  Look around.
[03:44:52.945 --> 03:44:55.286]  Look what's going on.
[03:44:55.286 --> 03:44:58.268]  Again, do what you can to support InfoWars.
[03:44:58.268 --> 03:45:00.990]  Keep the truth alive and support the Trends Journal.
[03:45:00.990 --> 03:45:03.071]  There's no other magazine like it in the world.
[03:45:03.071 --> 03:45:04.172]  Nothing.
[03:45:04.172 --> 03:45:08.194]  If you can't afford $0.35 a day, we'll give you a break.
[03:45:08.194 --> 03:45:09.595]  There's a money-back guarantee.
[03:45:11.047 --> 03:45:12.388]  The future's in our hands.
[03:45:12.388 --> 03:45:22.116]  It does not take a majority to prevail, but rather an irate, tireless minority keen on setting brushfires of freedom in the minds of Medicine's Samuel Adams.
[03:45:22.116 --> 03:45:26.540]  And now is the time for those brushfires of freedom and peace.
