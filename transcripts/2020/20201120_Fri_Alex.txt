[00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:09.699]  The flood has been proven and we demand that Georgia and Michigan and others have a legislative emergency session.
[00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:15.238]  They have now said that Detroit is not certified and was a fraud.
[00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:17.879]  So are many counties in Georgia.
[00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.842]  We need the governor not to listen to the other operatives in the state.
[00:00:23.383 --> 00:00:27.645]  We demand the legislature start an emergency session.
[00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.767]  Emergency session now!
[00:00:31.468 --> 00:00:33.849]  Emergency session now!
[00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:36.831]  Emergency session now!
[00:00:37.471 --> 00:00:39.773]  Emergency session now!
[00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:45.316]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:50.246]  It's November 20th.
[00:00:50.826 --> 00:00:51.386]  The year is 2020.
[00:00:51.806 --> 00:00:53.427]  That's 11-20-2020.
[00:00:53.447 --> 00:00:57.649]  Alex Jones here on the road.
[00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:59.250]  I was just at the Georgia Guidestones.
[00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:09.074]  I'm about to enter back into Atlanta, and we're going to be demonstrating again at the Capitol building for several hours today with the protesters.
[00:01:09.554 --> 00:01:11.135]  More and more have been arriving.
[00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:16.197]  As most of you know, Georgia did exactly what Trump and Giuliani predicted.
[00:01:16.677 --> 00:01:17.538]  They ran the recount.
[00:01:18.911 --> 00:01:19.832]  The exact same way.
[00:01:19.932 --> 00:01:21.314]  That's not what the president asked for.
[00:01:21.374 --> 00:01:23.276]  He asked for the signatures to be verified.
[00:01:24.237 --> 00:01:26.880]  He asked for investigations of all the missing ballots.
[00:01:28.394 --> 00:01:29.555]  That have now been confirmed.
[00:01:30.215 --> 00:01:31.657]  But the fight is far from over.
[00:01:32.417 --> 00:01:41.124]  They were going to certify the key Michigan election in Detroit until it turned out the people that were being threatened to certify it went public.
[00:01:41.804 --> 00:01:49.089]  The great news is the president met, we now learned yesterday, with the leaders of the Republican House and Senate there in Michigan.
[00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.552]  And that's really got the Democrats and their fraudsters in the deep state scared because this has all been illegitimate.
[00:01:56.612 --> 00:02:03.074]  And when there's proof of fraud, there's massive proof of fraud, it's got to be the legislatures that call emergency sessions.
[00:02:03.815 --> 00:02:08.136]  That's why we've been in Georgia pushing for an emergency session to be called.
[00:02:08.596 --> 00:02:10.837]  We don't know if the governor is going to certify today or tomorrow.
[00:02:11.417 --> 00:02:16.979]  It was the same bureaucrats and rhino Republicans
[00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:24.102]  That have said that the recount yesterday did show basically the same numbers.
[00:02:24.742 --> 00:02:28.984]  Trump gained some votes, but it's about 13,000 votes now, more for Biden.
[00:02:30.191 --> 00:02:38.417]  Remember, Trump was way ahead until days and days after they had frozen the election that night and then found all of these magic ballots.
[00:02:38.437 --> 00:02:50.245]  It's also been confirmed that tens of thousands of ballots are not preached, they've not been folded, they've not been in a machine, they've not been in an envelope, and a perfect machine on the Scantrons has bubbled them in.
[00:02:51.277 --> 00:03:02.407]  But again, CNN stonewalls and says over and over and over again, along with all the other corporate establishment media, that there is no fraud, there is no proof, there's nothing happening.
[00:03:03.305 --> 00:03:10.110]  But now CNN has the headlines of, you should be scared, you should be concerned, there's danger, there's danger, what Trump's doing to the legislatures.
[00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:15.394]  Yeah, because you've been caught with your fraud, just like Russiagate, just like Ukrainegate, just like everything else.
[00:03:15.714 --> 00:03:23.620]  And if the establishment corporate media can't hoodwink people into buying their gaslighting, their mass hoax, then that's game over for them.
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.642]  So Trump has a duty, not just a right.
[00:03:28.203 --> 00:03:30.564]  to stand up to this fraud and say no to it.
[00:03:30.584 --> 00:03:39.607]  I'm not going to go back over all the numbers, but he won bigger in the battleground states than he did four years ago until they quit the counting.
[00:03:40.268 --> 00:03:41.028]  And remember what happened
[00:03:42.402 --> 00:03:47.745]  At 1030 at night a water main broke, so for four hours they had to stop counting.
[00:03:47.765 --> 00:04:01.273]  The truth is they put cardboard over the windows, there's video of this, and continued to count, running Joe Biden ballots through three times apiece, the same ballot, until they were able to go past Trump.
[00:04:02.553 --> 00:04:03.514]  Then where were they counting those?
[00:04:05.003 --> 00:04:08.045]  Inside the CNN Center, where they set up the vote counting.
[00:04:08.466 --> 00:04:10.427]  You cannot make up the irony.
[00:04:11.048 --> 00:04:13.870]  CNN doesn't just steal the truth from us.
[00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:17.453]  They steal our birthright, our heritage.
[00:04:17.713 --> 00:04:18.774]  I've been all over Atlanta.
[00:04:18.794 --> 00:04:20.655]  There's Trump signs all over the place in Atlanta.
[00:04:21.056 --> 00:04:22.637]  You don't even see Biden signs.
[00:04:23.358 --> 00:04:28.462]  When you're outside Atlanta, it's all you see is Trump signs, and everybody I talk to
[00:04:29.582 --> 00:04:30.382]  They're saying the same thing.
[00:04:30.742 --> 00:04:45.566]  You know, how is it that Trump did twice as good with Hispanic Americans, three times better than he did with black Americans, just four years ago, but they're to tell us to believe that white males went against the president, and that's magically how this happened.
[00:04:45.586 --> 00:04:48.086]  Yeah, you mean a bunch of old, dead white people?
[00:04:48.626 --> 00:04:52.967]  Some of which have been dead for a hundred years, eighty years, tens of thousands of them, it's all admitted.
[00:04:53.428 --> 00:04:54.408]  But CNN and others say,
[00:04:55.359 --> 00:04:56.020]  There's no proof.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.040]  Gaslighting.
[00:04:57.541 --> 00:04:58.282]  We're going to go to break.
[00:04:58.362 --> 00:04:58.722]  Come back.
[00:04:58.822 --> 00:04:59.923]  Owen Schroer is going to be here.
[00:05:00.303 --> 00:05:04.887]  I want to comment on Tucker Carlson, what he had to say last night about Sidney Powell and more.
[00:05:05.267 --> 00:05:07.789]  But remember, InfoWars is the light of liberty.
[00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.071]  It's actually exploding under this crisis.
[00:05:10.392 --> 00:05:18.038]  As people know, with the censorship, the one place to find the real data analysis is InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Band.Video.
[00:05:18.398 --> 00:05:19.760]  We'll be right back on this side of this break.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.382]  Please stay with us, Paul Reveres, and please spread the word.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.120]  Back better.
[00:05:25.701 --> 00:05:26.641]  The Great Reset.
[00:05:27.322 --> 00:05:28.222]  Agenda 21.
[00:05:29.343 --> 00:05:30.103]  Welcome my friends.
[00:05:31.644 --> 00:05:35.126]  Thank you for joining us on this live Friday broadcast.
[00:05:35.747 --> 00:05:39.489]  Owen Schroer is set to take over from Austin, Texas here in a few minutes.
[00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.091]  John Kerry has joined
[00:05:43.035 --> 00:06:09.767]  The Canadian Prime Minister, the British Prime Minister, the German Chancellor, oh, and a whole bunch of other European presidents in just the last 24 hours coming out and saying, COVID is the great reset to make populist nations like the UK with Brexit and the United States be punished for what we did so that we submit to them.
[00:06:10.931 --> 00:06:12.712]  Isn't that the most incredible thing ever?
[00:06:13.052 --> 00:06:25.839]  Go read the articles with direct links to John Kerry, and Justin Trudeau, and Boris Johnson, and Angela Merkel, and two other EU presidents.
[00:06:25.859 --> 00:06:26.580]  Go read it.
[00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:34.904]  Just last night and today, shooting their demonic, filthy, murdering, scumbag mouths off.
[00:06:34.924 --> 00:06:35.925]  They're attacking us.
[00:06:36.185 --> 00:06:37.706]  This is 21st century war.
[00:06:39.026 --> 00:06:39.867]  It's called siege.
[00:06:41.209 --> 00:06:46.412]  And they've got all these people trained now, 10 months into this, that never take the mask off, and now they're getting ready for lockdown too.
[00:06:46.432 --> 00:06:50.395]  That will put us into a depression and kill the third world.
[00:06:51.595 --> 00:06:53.036]  They talk about Great Reset ending poverty.
[00:06:53.056 --> 00:06:55.078]  Yeah, it'll end poverty, but it's killing people.
[00:06:55.098 --> 00:06:55.958]  The UN even admits it.
[00:06:56.138 --> 00:07:03.223]  The very ones doing it admit, give us billions more, because now we've got to feed everybody in Africa and places that are starving to death, because they've cut the damn economies off.
[00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:09.587]  Because here, you lose your job, you just live on welfare, and then end up losing your house.
[00:07:10.578 --> 00:07:12.519]  But in places like Africa, you starve to death.
[00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:14.319]  And that's where we're buying produce.
[00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:16.180]  The biggest producers are flowers.
[00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:21.002]  All that stuff that is a non-essential economy is essential to them, and they die.
[00:07:21.622 --> 00:07:24.143]  Think about being called non-essential.
[00:07:25.543 --> 00:07:33.346]  But it all hides in plain view of a bunch of simpering leftists, because the left in this country, liberals in this country, have totally abandoned all their morals and everything else.
[00:07:33.706 --> 00:07:35.087]  And they're also a bunch of useful idiots.
[00:07:35.387 --> 00:07:36.167]  The average leftist
[00:07:37.395 --> 00:07:43.041]  He's even being more severely hurt by the lockdowns and the shutdowns and their cult-like subservience, but they don't care.
[00:07:44.142 --> 00:07:51.049]  Because they think by going along with mainstream media and supporting endless wars and all the corruption that they're somehow the good guys and they're the resistance.
[00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:52.491]  You're not woke.
[00:07:52.811 --> 00:07:53.692]  You're not the resistance.
[00:07:54.353 --> 00:07:55.033]  You're the problem.
[00:07:55.854 --> 00:07:58.297]  Now I want to play a clip of Tucker Carlson
[00:07:59.557 --> 00:08:17.551]  Talking about Sidney Powell last night, one of the lawyers on Trump's team, and the fact that the last week he's requested many, many times that they give him the proof and that she has not given him the proof of the algorithm manipulation that she says is going on.
[00:08:18.192 --> 00:08:26.498]  Now, I have some comments on this, but first, let's play a few minutes of what Tucker Carlson had to say last night, and I'll come back and give you the actual breakdown.
[00:08:26.718 --> 00:08:27.199]  Stay with us.
[00:08:27.961 --> 00:08:32.082]  By former prosecutor Sidney Powell, who has also served as General Mike Flynn's lawyer.
[00:08:32.722 --> 00:08:36.763]  For more than a week, Powell has been all over conservative media with the following story.
[00:08:37.403 --> 00:08:46.725]  This election was stolen by a collection of international leftists who manipulated vote tabulating software in order to flip millions of votes from Donald Trump to Joe Biden.
[00:08:47.325 --> 00:08:54.547]  The other day on television, Powell said of Trump that when the fraud is finally uncovered, quote, I think we'll find he had at least 80 million votes.
[00:08:55.427 --> 00:09:00.510]  In other words, rigged software stole about 7 million votes in this election.
[00:09:01.351 --> 00:09:03.772]  Here's some of what Powell said today about the software.
[00:09:05.273 --> 00:09:09.795]  One of its most characteristic features is its ability to flip votes.
[00:09:10.476 --> 00:09:20.542]  It can set and run an algorithm that probably ran all over the country to take a certain percentage of votes from President Trump and flip them to President Biden.
[00:09:21.082 --> 00:09:32.432]  Which we might never have uncovered had the votes for President Trump not been so overwhelming in so many of these states that it broke the algorithm that had been plugged into the system.
[00:09:32.813 --> 00:09:37.217]  And that's what caused them to have to shut down in the states they shut down in.
[00:09:38.769 --> 00:09:42.212]  That was a few hours ago, but Sidney Powell has been saying similar things for days.
[00:09:42.412 --> 00:09:45.454]  On Sunday night, we texted her after watching one of her segments.
[00:09:45.974 --> 00:09:50.878]  What Powell was describing would amount to the single greatest crime in American history.
[00:09:51.638 --> 00:09:53.680]  Millions of votes stolen in a day.
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:55.962]  Democracy destroyed.
[00:09:56.422 --> 00:09:59.264]  The end of our centuries-old system of self-government.
[00:09:59.324 --> 00:10:00.125]  Not a small thing.
[00:10:01.004 --> 00:10:04.326]  Now, to be perfectly clear, we did not dismiss any of it.
[00:10:04.806 --> 00:10:08.808]  We don't dismiss anything anymore, particularly when it's related to technology.
[00:10:09.148 --> 00:10:11.450]  We've talked to too many Silicon Valley whistleblowers.
[00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:12.610]  We've seen too much.
[00:10:13.431 --> 00:10:17.633]  After four years, this may be the single most open-minded show on television.
[00:10:17.913 --> 00:10:27.859]  We literally do UFO segments, not because we're crazy or even been interested in the subject, but because there is evidence that UFOs are real and everyone lies about it.
[00:10:28.663 --> 00:10:34.726]  There's evidence that a lot of things that responsible people use to dismiss out-of-hand as ridiculous are in fact real.
[00:10:34.886 --> 00:10:36.227]  And we don't care who mocks it.
[00:10:36.967 --> 00:10:44.731]  The louder the Yale Political Science Department and the staff of the Atlantic Magazine scream, Conspiracy Theory, the more interested we tend to be.
[00:10:44.751 --> 00:10:46.992]  That's usually a sign you're over the target.
[00:10:47.653 --> 00:10:50.974]  A lot of people with impressive-sounding credentials in this country are frauds.
[00:10:51.474 --> 00:10:52.815]  They have no idea what they're doing.
[00:10:53.315 --> 00:10:57.878]  They're children posing as authorities, and when they're caught, they lie, and then they blame you for it.
[00:10:58.678 --> 00:10:59.618]  We see that every day.
[00:10:59.738 --> 00:11:02.539]  It's the central theme of this show and will continue to be.
[00:11:03.599 --> 00:11:06.300]  So that's a long way of saying we took Sidney Powell seriously.
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:07.581]  We had no intention of fighting with her.
[00:11:07.621 --> 00:11:08.741]  We've always respected her work.
[00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:10.841]  We simply wanted to see the details.
[00:11:10.942 --> 00:11:12.222]  How could you not want to see them?
[00:11:13.082 --> 00:11:14.743]  So we invited Sidney Powell on the show.
[00:11:14.803 --> 00:11:16.163]  We would have given her the whole hour.
[00:11:16.383 --> 00:11:21.344]  We would have given her the entire week, actually, and listened quietly the whole time at rapt attention.
[00:11:22.125 --> 00:11:23.145]  That's a big story.
[00:11:24.335 --> 00:11:27.620]  But you never sent us any evidence, despite a lot of requests.
[00:11:27.701 --> 00:11:28.462]  Polite requests.
[00:11:28.622 --> 00:11:29.183]  Not a page.
[00:11:29.909 --> 00:11:33.171]  When we kept pressing, she got angry and told us to stop contacting her.
[00:11:33.812 --> 00:11:40.376]  When we checked with others around the Trump campaign, people in positions of authority, they told us Powell has never given them any evidence either.
[00:11:40.936 --> 00:11:43.678]  Nor did she provide any today at the press conference.
[00:11:44.178 --> 00:11:46.260]  Powell did say that electronic voting is dangerous.
[00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:47.080]  And she's right.
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:47.821]  We're with her there.
[00:11:48.501 --> 00:11:55.306]  But she never demonstrated that a single actual vote was moved illegitimately by software from one candidate to another.
[00:11:55.606 --> 00:11:56.006]  Not one.
[00:11:57.267 --> 00:11:58.228]  So why are we telling you this?
[00:11:59.056 --> 00:12:01.137]  We're telling you this because it's true.
[00:12:02.158 --> 00:12:03.659]  And in the end, that's all that matters.
[00:12:03.939 --> 00:12:04.460]  The truth.
[00:12:05.561 --> 00:12:06.441]  It's our only hope.
[00:12:07.122 --> 00:12:08.182]  It's our best defense.
[00:12:09.323 --> 00:12:10.924]  And it's how we're different from them.
[00:12:11.705 --> 00:12:12.886]  We care what's true.
[00:12:13.046 --> 00:12:14.447]  And we know you care too.
[00:12:15.388 --> 00:12:16.188]  That's why we told you.
[00:12:17.409 --> 00:12:22.432]  Maybe Sidney Powell will come forward soon with details on exactly how this happened and precisely who did it.
[00:12:23.073 --> 00:12:23.673]  Maybe she will.
[00:12:23.713 --> 00:12:25.835]  We are certainly hopeful that she will.
[00:12:26.741 --> 00:12:35.624]  What happened with the vote counting this month, and at the polling places in Detroit, and the polling places in Philadelphia, and so much else, actually matters.
[00:12:37.165 --> 00:12:40.906]  It matters no matter who you voted for, it matters whether or not you think this election is already over.
[00:12:41.546 --> 00:12:47.328]  Until we know the answers to those questions conclusively, and we can agree on them, this country will not be united.
[00:12:49.209 --> 00:12:52.850]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, that was Tucker Carlson last night.
[00:12:53.697 --> 00:12:58.980]  The number one rated show on primetime news television.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:06.423]  When we come back from this upcoming break, Alex Jones is going to dive deeper into what all of this means.
[00:13:07.724 --> 00:13:14.527]  And of course, the electronic voting machines and the evidence that Sidney Powell is going to have to come up with.
[00:13:16.148 --> 00:13:19.870]  And then some of the behind the scenes stuff that's going on.
[00:13:21.377 --> 00:13:30.559]  I think, quite frankly, and I've been saying this, this is going to be the toughest legal challenge for Trump's team, and it's going to be proving that the voting machines were rigged.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:39.022]  And you already have Dominion backing out of testifying in Pennsylvania today.
[00:13:40.282 --> 00:13:47.324]  The headline on the Gateway Pundit is, Dominion voting system backs out from testifying before Pennsylvania State House Committee.
[00:13:47.464 --> 00:13:48.344]  What are they hiding?
[00:13:49.244 --> 00:13:51.126]  The Pennsylvania House Republicans made a statement.
[00:13:51.587 --> 00:13:52.728]  Representative Don Keefer.
[00:14:10.481 --> 00:14:15.783]  And so they're recounting in Wisconsin, they're recounting in Georgia, but they're recounting the fake votes.
[00:14:16.604 --> 00:14:27.709]  And you can't recount votes that are just numbers and data on a computer, on a database, and you don't actually have a paper record.
[00:14:29.129 --> 00:14:31.270]  So this is a near impossible challenge.
[00:14:32.411 --> 00:14:35.572]  These rigged voting machines have been used around the world for decades.
[00:14:35.632 --> 00:14:36.893]  They've mastered their craft.
[00:14:38.424 --> 00:14:46.448]  Can Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, Joe DiGenova, Lin Wood, and others slay this beast?
[00:14:46.608 --> 00:14:51.571]  Slay these rigged elections that happen worldwide with Dominion voting systems and Smartmatic?
[00:14:53.532 --> 00:15:01.136]  This is a final level battle for the United States of America, for democracy, and for our republic.
[00:15:01.817 --> 00:15:05.499]  And Alex Jones breaks it all down on the other side of this short break.
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:10.261]  Very strong words from Tucker Carlson about Sidney Powell.
[00:15:10.882 --> 00:15:13.543]  First, let me just say I've been friends with Tucker Carlson for 10 years.
[00:15:13.563 --> 00:15:15.023]  He listens to my show.
[00:15:15.043 --> 00:15:15.903]  I listen to his show.
[00:15:15.923 --> 00:15:24.347]  I think he's got some of the best guests and best analysis and the most courage of anybody on mainstream television or even radio, for that matter, other than InfoWars.
[00:15:25.607 --> 00:15:34.250]  And I understand why he's frustrated with Sidney Powell, one of Trump's main lawyers, and looking into fraud, because he offered her the whole show, 45 minutes of airtime.
[00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:36.031]  You might have seen the commercials.
[00:15:37.492 --> 00:15:40.033]  And she responded back, oh, I can't just go on for five minutes.
[00:15:41.114 --> 00:15:47.057]  I would need more time to present my truth, and I'm too busy investigating what's going on.
[00:15:47.918 --> 00:15:48.979]  Well, here's the problem with that.
[00:15:49.579 --> 00:15:54.622]  He did offer you an hour, and the press conference you did didn't get covered by the media because they're shutting you out.
[00:15:54.642 --> 00:15:59.725]  You would have had one of the biggest audiences in media out there for you and Giuliani to go on his show.
[00:16:01.005 --> 00:16:04.749]  All you have to do is provide him with the proof of the algorithm.
[00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:09.233]  Now, that said, there is proof of the algorithm.
[00:16:09.573 --> 00:16:15.619]  The problem is, Sidney Powell is not a mathematician, she's not a software engineer, she's not a statistician.
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:21.545]  And there are a whole group, four different groups, I've talked to Trump's lawyers, people that are right here in Georgia, high level.
[00:16:22.546 --> 00:16:24.968]  There are four corporate groups that have scanned
[00:16:26.121 --> 00:16:31.763]  And it is basically the exact same shaving of numbers and manipulation that is statistically impossible.
[00:16:39.116 --> 00:16:45.279]  They simply need to present the information that those groups have garnered, the software engineers have found, and give it to Tucker Carlson.
[00:16:45.839 --> 00:16:59.986]  Anyone with their own eyeball can see that as soon as they close the polls prematurely in Georgia, in Michigan, other areas, that instead of a organic circle or curve, it went straight up for Biden in all those states.
[00:17:00.687 --> 00:17:03.628]  So that's what the computers are picking up.
[00:17:03.688 --> 00:17:06.550]  And I've interviewed Bev Harris and all the other experts.
[00:17:07.799 --> 00:17:11.683]  About Dominion, about all these software companies that have been banned in most states.
[00:17:11.823 --> 00:17:14.085]  My God, it's famous how they've been caught.
[00:17:14.125 --> 00:17:18.890]  It's famous how they put patches on the day before the election and weird groups were breaking in.
[00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:25.176]  But it's so complex that judges don't understand it, the general public doesn't understand it, and lawyers like Powell doesn't understand it.
[00:17:25.796 --> 00:17:26.577]  They're sitting there.
[00:17:27.438 --> 00:17:32.202]  They're collating this and going over it and they're waiting too long to present it.
[00:17:32.643 --> 00:17:37.207]  It needs to be given as the raw data to people like Tucker Carlson, myself and others.
[00:17:38.755 --> 00:17:39.736]  I'll give you another wrinkle in this.
[00:17:39.776 --> 00:17:42.078]  I was talking to one of the top lawyers that speaks to Trump daily.
[00:17:42.558 --> 00:17:50.564]  Trump has agreed for over a week that trying to go after algorithms and the voting machines is something that the public just doesn't understand.
[00:17:50.624 --> 00:17:54.187]  But what we do understand is law about signature verification.
[00:17:54.848 --> 00:18:02.894]  Now you've got to have signature verification if you show up in person, but not supposedly, according to these agreements that were made by governors outside of law, outside of the legislature.
[00:18:04.193 --> 00:18:05.754]  in the states.
[00:18:16.718 --> 00:18:18.520]  In the six states that showed the anomaly.
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:20.282]  Hell, these be in California too.
[00:18:20.722 --> 00:18:27.470]  Judge ruled Newsom illegally said mail-in ballots had to be 100% in many counties and said that signatures to be waived.
[00:18:28.030 --> 00:18:29.071]  So that's the reality.
[00:18:29.532 --> 00:18:31.674]  And I understand Tucker Carlson's frustration.
[00:18:32.135 --> 00:18:33.957]  And I understand him putting Powell on the spot.
[00:18:34.497 --> 00:18:34.717]  I think?
[00:18:55.472 --> 00:18:57.353]  We're going to continue fighting the globalist takeover.
[00:18:57.393 --> 00:19:01.674]  This is America under war, a new type of war, a globalist corporate chi-com war.
[00:19:02.154 --> 00:19:04.755]  And the sooner people figure that out, the better we're going to be able to turn this around.
[00:19:04.995 --> 00:19:11.498]  Because it's only going to get worse until people wake up and stop complying with the overblown hoax that is COVID-19.
[00:19:11.858 --> 00:19:19.761]  Top epidemiologists coming out saying it's basically not even as bad as the flu, that it's hysteria, that it's going to kill tens of millions by starvation.
[00:19:20.201 --> 00:19:23.302]  All of that is now confirmed, and the globalists on the left admit
[00:19:23.942 --> 00:19:28.506]  Let's real quickly go to Sidney Powell's response with Maria Bartiromo this morning.
[00:19:54.218 --> 00:19:58.620]  Alright, Sidney, I want you to respond to what Tucker Carlson said last night, Sidney.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:17.689]  I don't know if you watched it, but Tucker Carlson said that he had invited you on his show to share evidence of the software flipping votes, and he said you got angry and refused to provide evidence for your claims of voting software flipping votes.
[00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:20.010]  How do you respond to Tucker Carlson?
[00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:26.152]  Did you get angry with the show because they texted you and asked you to please provide evidence of what you're alleging?
[00:20:27.733 --> 00:20:30.594]  No, I didn't get angry with the request to provide evidence.
[00:20:30.674 --> 00:20:37.016]  In fact, I sent an affidavit to Tucker that I had not even attached to a pleading yet.
[00:20:37.588 --> 00:20:41.069]  Now quite frankly, I think that this is irrelevant and maybe even a little bit petty bickering that's happening here.
[00:21:09.202 --> 00:21:13.566]  I don't understand why Sidney Powell would reveal her evidence, quite frankly.
[00:21:14.407 --> 00:21:18.130]  Why would Sidney Powell reveal all of her evidence before it gets to court?
[00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:31.921]  I don't know a single lawyer that's getting ready for a major court battle that would do that and then give the defense a chance to preemptively respond or prepare an argument against the evidence you're about to bring forward.
[00:21:33.202 --> 00:21:34.142]  I don't understand that.
[00:21:50.808 --> 00:21:52.129]  I don't really understand that.
[00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:58.292]  A couple other anecdotal pieces of information here before we come back and are rejoined by Alex Jones.
[00:21:58.973 --> 00:22:08.198]  In 2012, President Trump tweeted out that he believes the voting machines were rigged and were flipping votes from Romney to Obama.
[00:22:08.678 --> 00:22:09.899]  So Trump has known about this.
[00:22:09.939 --> 00:22:11.219]  This has been on Trump's radar.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:17.823]  Now, whether he thinks that that is the biggest thing to look at or signatures or the mail-in ballots or all of it,
[00:22:19.361 --> 00:22:22.202]  We know all the different angles that they're using for the theft.
[00:22:23.322 --> 00:22:26.082]  I think the voting machines have to be target number one.
[00:22:27.763 --> 00:22:31.243]  I don't think they can even get enough mail-in ballots with fake signatures to beat Trump.
[00:22:31.283 --> 00:22:32.983]  They needed the electronic voting machines.
[00:22:33.484 --> 00:22:34.704]  They needed those rig jobs.
[00:22:35.944 --> 00:22:38.284]  So I think that's target number one.
[00:22:38.905 --> 00:22:39.605]  Now be careful!
[00:22:41.085 --> 00:22:46.366]  These stories that are surfacing about seizures of hard drives in Germany
[00:22:47.745 --> 00:22:58.208]  That are allegedly, I guess it's called sidle, that are harboring information that gets transferred, harboring vote data that gets transferred in the voting process from America to Germany to Spain and then I guess back to America for the results.
[00:22:58.248 --> 00:22:58.928]  Very suspicious.
[00:23:00.268 --> 00:23:01.409]  Be very weary.
[00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:06.210]  Be very weary about this story.
[00:23:08.837 --> 00:23:13.428]  Claiming that the FBI or someone went in and raided those servers.
[00:23:13.528 --> 00:23:14.610]  Let me tell you something right now.
[00:23:15.412 --> 00:23:18.279]  If it was the FBI or the CIA, it's game over.
[00:23:19.121 --> 00:23:19.941]  They've got the evidence.
[00:23:20.462 --> 00:23:21.022]  It's gone.
[00:23:21.402 --> 00:23:22.103]  Forget about it.
[00:23:22.803 --> 00:23:24.544]  The FBI is not on our side.
[00:23:25.245 --> 00:23:26.925]  The CIA is not on our side.
[00:23:27.686 --> 00:23:30.187]  I'm debating whether the Department of Justice is on our side.
[00:23:30.227 --> 00:23:36.891]  So, if the CIA or the FBI or someone actually went in there and got those hard drives, it's gone, folks.
[00:23:37.652 --> 00:23:38.092]  It's gone.
[00:23:38.752 --> 00:23:39.693]  That's not a good thing.
[00:23:40.513 --> 00:23:41.494]  Alex Jones on the other side.
[00:23:41.957 --> 00:23:45.799]  It's a very important article on Infowars.com that everyone needs to read.
[00:23:46.839 --> 00:23:48.079]  It's about sleepy Joe Biden.
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:58.644]  Biden claims support for national shutdown was hypothetical, just like shutting down fracking and oil and gas was hypothetical, even though Obama basically did that.
[00:23:59.696 --> 00:24:04.860]  And now he's saying, oh, he didn't mean it when he said he'd, quote, listen to the scientists if they said it and shut it down.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:11.964]  He says he's going to shut some things down, but it's going to be calibrated so that he can shut the virus down.
[00:24:12.625 --> 00:24:13.686]  That's called doublespeak.
[00:24:14.146 --> 00:24:19.650]  The globalists want to shut us down, to bankrupt us, to get us into debt, to control us, to put everybody on welfare.
[00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.192]  That's their stated clout and pivot plan.
[00:24:23.072 --> 00:24:25.593]  And now they know Trump isn't conceding.
[00:24:25.613 --> 00:24:26.954]  They know the evidence of fraud is coming out.
[00:24:26.974 --> 00:24:30.375]  They know Americans know that he's totally unpopular, a.k.a.
[00:24:30.415 --> 00:24:40.180]  Biden, and that the fact that they understand he plans to put us back under total lockdown is energizing the public to resist that much more.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:40.980]  And that's why Biden
[00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:44.173]  is so incredibly concerned.
[00:24:44.954 --> 00:24:57.012]  And that's why it's so important that you tell everyone you know that they now admit the Great Reset and Build Back Better is an admitted UN, global government, IMF, World Bank plan.
[00:24:58.581 --> 00:24:58.741]  This is
[00:25:16.442 --> 00:25:17.442]  This is discrimination.
[00:25:17.703 --> 00:25:18.663]  This is out of control.
[00:25:19.063 --> 00:25:20.144]  This is fraud.
[00:25:20.524 --> 00:25:22.365]  Go read it for yourself.
[00:25:22.725 --> 00:25:25.226]  Joe Biden couldn't get elected to the school board.
[00:25:25.606 --> 00:25:27.287]  Joe Biden's been a failure his whole life.
[00:25:27.747 --> 00:25:29.628]  Joe Biden has been a scam artist his whole life.
[00:25:29.948 --> 00:25:33.730]  Joe Biden is a communist Chinese agent and has been caught on record.
[00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.331]  Even if he won the election, which he clearly didn't, he is illegitimate.
[00:25:37.612 --> 00:25:38.032]  They said
[00:25:39.116 --> 00:25:41.679]  Trump was a Russian agent with no proof and tried to remove him.
[00:25:42.399 --> 00:25:45.803]  Ladies and gentlemen, then he said that he was meddling in Ukraine illegally.
[00:25:45.843 --> 00:25:46.263]  He wasn't.
[00:25:46.704 --> 00:25:50.127]  We have Joe Biden and his son on the Chinese Communist payroll.
[00:25:50.628 --> 00:25:56.414]  We have them with the electronic voting machines and the massive algorithmic fraud that does show up in all the numbers.
[00:25:56.934 --> 00:25:59.755]  And there's no way this person can be seen as the president.
[00:26:00.196 --> 00:26:05.118]  The globalists are arrogant, they're disconnected, and they have bitten off more than they can chew.
[00:26:05.598 --> 00:26:06.759]  Back to Owen Schroer.
[00:26:07.119 --> 00:26:14.442]  I'll be reporting live from the Capitol, coming up here in Georgia, as we battle to try to stop the governor from certifying the fraudulent election.
[00:26:14.762 --> 00:26:16.443]  You already heard it's been certified, it's not true.
[00:26:16.923 --> 00:26:24.987]  The state level that re-ran the tabulation, running the same scam over again, has said it's certified, even though they found a bunch of new votes for Trump.
[00:26:26.291 --> 00:26:29.655]  We're calling for the legislature to be called in to do a real investigation.
[00:26:29.995 --> 00:26:31.196]  That's the constitutional angle.
[00:26:31.637 --> 00:26:35.041]  And Trump's also moving to get the legislature of Michigan to do it.
[00:26:35.121 --> 00:26:38.685]  And they've come out and said they found massive fraud at the Detroit level.
[00:26:38.725 --> 00:26:42.129]  And they have hundreds and hundreds of affidavits in dozens of counties.
[00:26:42.529 --> 00:26:44.111]  It's absolutely insane.
[00:26:44.171 --> 00:26:44.952]  They locked them up.
[00:26:45.232 --> 00:26:46.393]  They kicked the watchers out.
[00:26:47.278 --> 00:26:56.605]  From Georgia to Pennsylvania to Michigan, this is so incredibly obvious, just like all the other frauds, all the other scams that the globalists have run.
[00:26:57.045 --> 00:27:06.752]  And now they're so desperate to legitimize the mainstream media, to legitimize the Democrats, to protect themselves from the prosecution they would go under for selling America out, not just Biden.
[00:27:07.312 --> 00:27:10.855]  Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back into the InfoWars World Headquarters here in Austin, Texas.
[00:27:11.035 --> 00:27:12.796]  Alex Jones is on the road in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:27:12.836 --> 00:27:14.638]  He will be at the State Capitol.
[00:27:14.678 --> 00:27:16.579]  In fact, I believe he's at the State Capitol.
[00:27:36.570 --> 00:27:37.211]  Right now.
[00:27:37.873 --> 00:27:42.983]  And then of course tomorrow is the big rally in Atlanta, Georgia.
[00:27:44.365 --> 00:27:45.067]  I predict that
[00:27:46.189 --> 00:27:53.091]  Trump-supporting American patriots will essentially surround the Capitol building there in downtown Atlanta.
[00:27:53.191 --> 00:27:57.233]  Of course, this is a nationwide demonstration.
[00:27:58.013 --> 00:28:04.855]  People are going to their state capitals at noon every Saturday as part of this Stop the Steal demonstration.
[00:28:04.875 --> 00:28:10.898]  I'm also hearing major groups are organizing for another Million MAGA March on December 12th.
[00:28:12.038 --> 00:28:14.519]  I will be at the state capitol in Austin, Texas tomorrow.
[00:28:15.453 --> 00:28:16.014]  At noon.
[00:28:18.395 --> 00:28:18.816]  Join me.
[00:28:18.836 --> 00:28:22.499]  People say, hey, well, you know, don't you know Trump won Texas?
[00:28:22.519 --> 00:28:23.039]  What are you doing?
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:28.584]  No, this is a United States of America protect our elections movement.
[00:28:29.605 --> 00:28:33.648]  This is a. Everyone has to get involved.
[00:28:33.988 --> 00:28:41.834]  Sure, they're trying to steal Georgia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Nevada, but they're stealing our democracy.
[00:28:41.875 --> 00:28:44.697]  They're stealing our vote as a nation.
[00:28:46.175 --> 00:28:48.716]  So yes, everybody must get involved.
[00:28:49.976 --> 00:28:53.657]  I want to go to another video showing the complete voter fraud.
[00:28:53.697 --> 00:29:01.478]  And now you have Barack Obama making threats on national TV that I have a feeling is going to majorly backfire on him.
[00:29:01.538 --> 00:29:02.479]  So we'll have that coming up.
[00:29:02.519 --> 00:29:12.581]  But an individual who's getting retweeted by President Trump has put out multiple graphs of Wisconsin.
[00:29:14.435 --> 00:29:32.168]  And Michigan basically highlighting what I highlighted on the Stop the Steal Caravan, except really going into detail and showing the complete fraud when they get tranches and boxes and boxes and boxes of votes, mail-in ballots, magically hundreds of thousands, all for Biden and only Biden.
[00:29:32.948 --> 00:29:33.749]  Nothing suspicious.
[00:29:34.798 --> 00:29:37.580]  About that, and then he magically wins Wisconsin and Michigan.
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:40.441]  It's Justin Hart who's put all this out.
[00:29:40.481 --> 00:29:41.402]  Trump has retweeted it.
[00:29:41.782 --> 00:29:58.832]  This is all publicly available information, including a young individual who went and looked at the open data for the election results in Pennsylvania, and just on his own research, found what appeared to be about 100,000 illegal votes, all for Joe Biden.
[00:29:59.152 --> 00:30:01.293]  Again, this is all publicly available information.
[00:30:01.353 --> 00:30:02.894]  Tucker Carlson can go find this if he wants.
[00:30:04.465 --> 00:30:16.514]  Here is the actual Pennsylvania open data that show very mysterious patterns in the Pennsylvania votes coming in late at night.
[00:30:16.654 --> 00:30:18.575]  Again, this guy just went and analyzed the data.
[00:30:18.615 --> 00:30:19.336]  Here's what he found out.
[00:30:21.107 --> 00:30:26.550]  The following information is straight from the PA.gov website and has almost 3.1 million entries.
[00:30:27.430 --> 00:30:34.794]  I exported all that information into an Excel sheet, but I was cut off at about 1 million rows, so keep in mind we're working with one-third of the whole data set.
[00:30:35.175 --> 00:30:42.038]  So the first thing I did was create a column to see if any ballots were mailed out by the government the same day that they were received filled out through the mail by the voter.
[00:30:42.819 --> 00:30:48.662]  Turns out about 11,000 were filled out by the voter and returned back to the government the same day the government mailed them out to the voter.
[00:30:49.673 --> 00:30:58.621]  I then created a column to see if there were any applications that were approved by the government, mailed out by the government, received by the voter, and then filled out by the voter and mailed back to the government on the same day.
[00:30:59.842 --> 00:31:02.265]  And there were 8,205 cases of that.
[00:31:02.825 --> 00:31:09.011]  And lastly, I created a column to see if there were any ballots that were received through the mail, filled out before they were even mailed out by the government.
[00:31:09.591 --> 00:31:10.332]  There were 7,403 cases of that.
[00:31:12.779 --> 00:31:15.221]  Pause the screen to read each definition of the columns.
[00:31:15.882 --> 00:31:19.405]  If anyone's able to make sense of these numbers without saying it's fraud, please let me know in the comments.
[00:31:20.245 --> 00:31:34.398]  Now you have to multiply those data sets by three because you only had one third of the actual data, and when it comes out to it, it's about 80,000 mail-in ballots that seem fake because of these dates not adding up.
[00:31:35.455 --> 00:31:40.418]  And it's all right there, publicly available, about 100,000 votes for Biden, magically, with data.
[00:31:40.879 --> 00:31:44.541]  Some of them dated that's literally impossible unless you have time travelers voting.
[00:31:45.242 --> 00:31:48.484]  I guess you have dead people voting for Biden, so I guess time travelers will too.
[00:31:49.465 --> 00:31:53.367]  And then you have mail-in ballots coming in and getting received and counted on the same day too?
[00:31:54.288 --> 00:31:54.628]  Hmm.
[00:31:55.848 --> 00:31:59.230]  By the way, we do have clips of Biden who spoke today in Delaware.
[00:31:59.270 --> 00:32:01.511]  He's just as bad as he ever was, folks.
[00:32:01.531 --> 00:32:02.231]  He can't even think.
[00:32:02.811 --> 00:32:03.492]  He can't talk.
[00:32:03.532 --> 00:32:04.692]  He can't read a teleprompter.
[00:32:04.752 --> 00:32:06.733]  It's a total embarrassment.
[00:32:08.774 --> 00:32:10.275]  But this is where we're at.
[00:32:10.295 --> 00:32:19.220]  So we'll have that coming up, too, as well as a threat that Obama made to President Trump, which I think, quite frankly, the odds are that this happens to you, Obama.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:21.801]  Happen to know some Navy SEALs?
[00:32:22.858 --> 00:32:24.599]  Some currently, some that are out.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.381]  I don't know a single one that liked you.
[00:32:28.983 --> 00:32:30.003]  So, yeah.
[00:32:30.744 --> 00:32:33.986]  Oh, and by the way, you're not the Commander-in-Chief, bucko.
[00:32:34.947 --> 00:32:35.948]  Never forget that, folks.
[00:32:37.489 --> 00:32:41.372]  The Commander-in-Chief is still Donald J. Trump.
[00:32:43.454 --> 00:32:44.414]  Is that the wild card?
[00:32:45.215 --> 00:32:46.176]  Or is that the ace card?
[00:32:46.936 --> 00:32:47.857]  Or is that the Trump card?
[00:32:49.343 --> 00:32:53.365]  This is the Alex Jones Show, brought to you by InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:53.425 --> 00:32:55.006]  I'm Owen Schroer, filling in for Alex Jones.
[00:32:55.026 --> 00:32:57.487]  We'll have more from Alex coming up on the other side.
[00:33:05.331 --> 00:33:16.537]  When people build temples, when powerful groups come together and etch their commandments into stone, and then put billions and billions of dollars
[00:33:17.941 --> 00:33:20.001]  into a project over decade after decade.
[00:33:22.022 --> 00:33:23.082]  You know it's their true love.
[00:33:24.842 --> 00:33:32.284]  We're here at the birthplace of the modern depopulation movement spearheaded by Ted Turner and then of course Bill Gates.
[00:33:32.324 --> 00:33:45.587]  We're here a few hours outside Atlanta, Georgia to the north at a place where Ted Turner's great-grandmother was from and they built
[00:33:46.843 --> 00:33:55.128]  This monument calling for forced depopulation of the planet and one world government.
[00:33:57.049 --> 00:33:58.930]  And here we are, 30 years later.
[00:34:01.511 --> 00:34:04.192]  And it's not the planning stages, the beta stages anymore.
[00:34:04.272 --> 00:34:06.073]  Now they've dropped the hammer, now inside of it.
[00:34:06.334 --> 00:34:08.435]  So look at this archetypal image.
[00:34:09.455 --> 00:34:10.436]  First look at the shadows.
[00:34:11.877 --> 00:34:12.277]  Plato.
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:24.865]  2,300 plus years ago, the modern father of eugenics and so much more, saying there's too many people we need to depopulate because humans are crushing the breast of Mother Earth.
[00:34:25.365 --> 00:34:36.650]  And then Malthus, 270 years ago, 250 years ago, saying we should kill the poor, we should spread disease, we should pack them into tiny little coffin-like apartments in London.
[00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.910]  There's too many people.
[00:34:39.410 --> 00:34:42.532]  This is the excuse of the elites to rule over the population.
[00:34:42.772 --> 00:34:48.035]  And then you had the social Darwinists at the turn of the last century, 1900, and the robber barons.
[00:34:49.155 --> 00:34:50.936]  And that was only a shadow.
[00:34:53.158 --> 00:34:56.039]  You see, that was all just the beginning.
[00:34:56.059 --> 00:34:57.100]  That was all the testing.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:03.984]  And we were there showing you the shape of their plans, showing you the books they wrote, the quotes they put out about depopulation, Prince Philip.
[00:35:07.028 --> 00:35:10.849]  Prince Charles all saying, we need to cut the world economy off.
[00:35:11.129 --> 00:35:12.209]  We need less consumption.
[00:35:13.250 --> 00:35:22.892]  And they said 10 years ago in the Rockefeller Foundation, Operation Lockstep will use a global threat of a virus to kill civilization and collapse the third world and collapse the first world.
[00:35:22.933 --> 00:35:25.273]  And now we're told it never ends.
[00:35:25.313 --> 00:35:33.676]  So all of that was the buildup to where we are moving from Plato right here, 2000,
[00:35:36.459 --> 00:36:00.524]  Plus, years ago, over the ages, all the slavery, all the wars, and all the way up in time, 550 years ago, we finally have the Renaissance and real Christian ideas and egalitarianism to build up humanity, to take care of the poor, to have running water, and that actually created our golden age.
[00:36:00.984 --> 00:36:03.185]  But they're deciding to go back to what Plato wanted.
[00:36:04.065 --> 00:36:04.805]  And that's where we are.
[00:36:06.052 --> 00:36:08.132]  We're not in the shadow of this anymore.
[00:36:08.152 --> 00:36:09.693]  We're not in the planning phases.
[00:36:10.813 --> 00:36:19.315]  We're now in the future, with those evil visions of the past, now manifesting in the year 2020.
[00:36:19.615 --> 00:36:21.656]  We're now zero hour.
[00:36:23.836 --> 00:36:31.298]  And Klaus Schwab and the UN, the Davos Group, all admit that their plan is to be the guardians of the galaxy.
[00:36:32.844 --> 00:36:34.405]  They'll decide who lives and dies.
[00:36:34.425 --> 00:36:35.165]  This is a U.N.
[00:36:35.205 --> 00:36:35.946]  temple, a U.N.
[00:36:35.986 --> 00:36:36.406]  shrine.
[00:36:36.506 --> 00:36:40.709]  Maintain humanity under 500 million and perpetual balance with nature.
[00:36:40.949 --> 00:36:42.170]  Somebody get out their calculator.
[00:36:42.870 --> 00:36:50.275]  If there's 7.5 billion people in the world and only 500 million are left, that's over an 80% population reduction.
[00:36:52.896 --> 00:36:54.397]  Wow, Hitler only killed 20 million.
[00:36:54.457 --> 00:36:55.398]  They want to kill billions.
[00:36:56.378 --> 00:36:57.239]  Step aside, Hitler.
[00:36:58.894 --> 00:37:01.555]  Guide reproductive systems wisely.
[00:37:02.075 --> 00:37:03.536]  Improving fitness and diversity.
[00:37:03.596 --> 00:37:04.416]  That's eugenics.
[00:37:04.816 --> 00:37:06.617]  They decide who can have children and who can't.
[00:37:06.797 --> 00:37:08.378]  That's why China had one-child policies.
[00:37:09.658 --> 00:37:17.421]  While they try to dumb the public down and make us as sick as possible, everything they say is the opposite of what they're actually doing when it comes to these little platitudes they put in.
[00:37:17.702 --> 00:37:21.223]  But they tell the truth in the first commandment and in the last commandment.
[00:37:21.823 --> 00:37:23.024]  Let's go to the last commandment.
[00:37:23.404 --> 00:37:25.165]  Be not a cancer on the earth.
[00:37:25.485 --> 00:37:26.845]  Leave room for nature!
[00:37:26.985 --> 00:37:28.386]  Leave room for nature!
[00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:37.498]  But the big trillion dollar companies and billionaires with their slave camps in China and Tim Cook won't even pay the workers in China enough to even have a house to live in.
[00:37:37.658 --> 00:37:43.004]  So most of them are homeless with engineering degrees and they go inside and their kids are chained up to power poles all day.
[00:37:43.684 --> 00:37:44.926]  Oh, the left loves that.
[00:37:45.466 --> 00:37:47.088]  They hate Trump because he's anti-war.
[00:37:47.388 --> 00:37:49.651]  Because see, war depopulates.
[00:37:50.905 --> 00:37:54.308]  Maintain humanity under 500 million, perpetual balance with nature.
[00:37:54.848 --> 00:37:58.291]  Guide reproduction wisely, improving fitness and diversity.
[00:37:58.632 --> 00:38:02.915]  Unite humanity with a living new language, Esperanza, the UN global language.
[00:38:03.516 --> 00:38:08.821]  Rule passion, faith, tradition, and all things with temper and reason, meaning they are the gods that give us reason.
[00:38:10.168 --> 00:38:12.089]  They decide who the social justice warriors are.
[00:38:12.149 --> 00:38:13.189]  They decide what's moral.
[00:38:13.329 --> 00:38:18.111]  Protect people and nations with fair laws and just courts through the UN.
[00:38:18.431 --> 00:38:23.013]  Let all nations rule internally, resolving external disputes in a world court.
[00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:25.340]  All of it's doublespeak.
[00:38:26.481 --> 00:38:28.322]  Avoid petty laws and useless officials.
[00:38:28.962 --> 00:38:37.567]  Need a world government that dissolves your local government that you control, and then you can't say a damn thing to the United Nations that runs extermination operations worldwide.
[00:38:38.427 --> 00:38:41.429]  Balance personal rights with social duties.
[00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:44.890]  You don't really have any rights in Article 30 of the UN.
[00:38:46.932 --> 00:38:48.112]  Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
[00:38:48.433 --> 00:38:52.454]  It says, oh, you have all these previous ones, unless we say so, then we can take them away.
[00:38:52.474 --> 00:38:54.215]  Well, a right you can take is not a right at all.
[00:38:56.195 --> 00:38:59.256]  Prize, truth, beauty, love, seeking harmony with the infinite.
[00:39:00.877 --> 00:39:02.578]  Be not a cancer on the earth.
[00:39:03.018 --> 00:39:04.118]  Leave room for nature.
[00:39:04.658 --> 00:39:05.599]  Leave room for nature.
[00:39:06.759 --> 00:39:09.880]  You've got it in eight major languages of the world.
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.321]  I guess that's Cyrillic.
[00:39:13.802 --> 00:39:14.402]  Greek, I don't know.
[00:39:15.925 --> 00:39:21.207]  Japanese and Chinese, you've got Arabic, Sanskrit, but over here it gives you a full breakdown.
[00:39:26.970 --> 00:39:36.134]  Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese, Russian, English, Spanish.
[00:39:38.775 --> 00:39:42.377]  And then up here at the top, let these guidestones
[00:39:43.479 --> 00:39:44.500]  To an age of reason.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.740]  Egyptian hieroglyphics.
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:46.601]  Sanskrit.
[00:39:47.181 --> 00:39:47.881]  Classical Greek.
[00:39:48.362 --> 00:39:49.422]  Babylonian cuneiform.
[00:39:50.003 --> 00:39:51.163]  The Georgia Guidestones.
[00:39:56.926 --> 00:39:59.728]  Channel through stone indicates celestial pole.
[00:40:00.749 --> 00:40:04.010]  Horizontal slot indicates annual travel of the sun.
[00:40:04.411 --> 00:40:05.191]  Transit of the sun.
[00:40:05.591 --> 00:40:08.973]  Sunbeam through the capstone marks noontime throughout the year.
[00:40:09.974 --> 00:40:10.254]  Arthur.
[00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:12.610]  Author R.C.
[00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:19.892]  Christian, a pseudonym for the eugenicist groups, sponsors a small group of Americans who seek the age of reason.
[00:40:20.932 --> 00:40:28.454]  The capsule placed six feet below this spot to be opened on after they've depopulated the Earth.
[00:40:28.874 --> 00:40:31.335]  Oh, and many of them believe it's a great, wonderful thing they're doing.
[00:40:32.830 --> 00:40:41.034]  But really it's all a great deception to not value humanity, to get rid of the population, to become transhumanist and actually throw off all of our humanity.
[00:40:41.434 --> 00:40:45.436]  Now they've revealed the deception and now they admit it's a post-human world entirely.
[00:40:45.956 --> 00:40:48.477]  Physical data, overall height 19 feet 3 inches.
[00:40:48.897 --> 00:40:50.498]  Total weight 237,746 pounds.
[00:40:50.518 --> 00:40:55.180]  Four major stones are 16 feet 4 inches high, each weighing an average of 42,437 pounds, 42,000 pounds.
[00:41:02.173 --> 00:41:05.894]  Center stone is 16 feet 4 inches high, weighs 20,000 plus pounds.
[00:41:06.494 --> 00:41:15.895]  Capstone, 9 feet 8 inches long, 6 feet 6 inches wide, 1 foot 7 inches thick, weighs 24,000 plus pounds.
[00:41:15.935 --> 00:41:19.916]  You can read it all right there for yourself.
[00:41:21.676 --> 00:41:29.958]  All of this is an occultic sundial, trying to call in the power of the universe, the energy of the universe, into this place.
[00:41:31.553 --> 00:41:42.634]  To carry out this commitment, to carry out this demand letter to humanity that we submit and that we bow down.
[00:41:47.213 --> 00:41:49.895]  You can decide whether you want to bow down to this or whether you want to fight it.
[00:41:50.295 --> 00:41:51.596]  But the point is, this is the world.
[00:41:51.936 --> 00:41:52.756]  This is the globalists.
[00:41:52.836 --> 00:41:53.577]  This is their plan.
[00:41:53.917 --> 00:41:54.757]  This is what they're doing.
[00:41:56.058 --> 00:41:57.339]  And you're now inside the trap.
[00:41:57.499 --> 00:42:00.541]  They launched it in 2020, 30 years after this was constructed.
[00:42:01.301 --> 00:42:03.643]  It didn't begin with this, but this is a signpost.
[00:42:03.663 --> 00:42:08.886]  This is a tombstone placed over humanity if we accept this curse.
[00:42:10.592 --> 00:42:11.452]  Do humans hurt the Earth?
[00:42:11.772 --> 00:42:12.293]  Absolutely.
[00:42:12.833 --> 00:42:17.395]  Are the globalists doing genetic engineering, human-animal cloning, toxic waste, things unspeakable?
[00:42:17.615 --> 00:42:19.495]  They actually believe they're going to transcend humanity.
[00:42:20.055 --> 00:42:22.636]  They just don't want us, the profane, to go into their new age.
[00:42:22.897 --> 00:42:26.558]  They must cleanse the Earth before they can take over and have the future.
[00:42:26.938 --> 00:42:31.920]  And now they're coming with mRNA vaccines that change your DNA and make you a GMO creature.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:37.302]  So now that they're in full control, you see the horrible nightmare they're creating that actually kills the Earth.
[00:42:38.351 --> 00:42:40.292]  Soon there'll be 5G at this location.
[00:42:40.532 --> 00:42:42.073]  It's already rippling with cell towers.
[00:42:42.433 --> 00:42:43.633]  The wildlife's already dying.
[00:42:44.393 --> 00:42:46.074]  And you don't see the globalists fighting that, no.
[00:42:46.654 --> 00:42:48.115]  The truth is they want to play God.
[00:42:48.635 --> 00:42:50.396]  And everything they do is about playing God.
[00:42:51.056 --> 00:42:53.777]  Now let's go over here and show you some of the surveillance systems that are here as well.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.440]  Let's get a wide shot of that too.
[00:43:18.533 --> 00:43:21.835]  They've been maintaining this for 30 years, tens of millions of dollars to maintain it.
[00:43:21.855 --> 00:43:24.897]  They've got all these surveillance cameras over there.
[00:43:24.917 --> 00:43:34.923]  Alright ladies and gentlemen, the full Alex Jones video live from the Georgia Guidestones can be found at band.video and infowars.com.
[00:43:36.072 --> 00:43:39.235]  The globalists are trying to censor what you can see and what you can share.
[00:43:39.535 --> 00:43:40.336]  Don't let them win.
[00:43:40.737 --> 00:43:45.521]  Go to our emergency election newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:43:45.782 --> 00:43:49.345]  Sign up for free and get intel they don't want you to have and then share it.
[00:43:49.665 --> 00:43:51.968]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[00:43:52.168 --> 00:43:54.630]  It's time to override the censors and get the truth out.
[00:43:55.131 --> 00:43:56.873]  And Owen Schroer here sitting in for Alex.
[00:43:57.073 --> 00:43:58.995]  I want to go to this clip.
[00:44:00.367 --> 00:44:12.637]  Barack Obama was on a not-funny comedy show last night with Jimmy Schimmel, and he made a threat to President Trump, saying Navy SEALs may remove him from the White House.
[00:44:14.199 --> 00:44:18.702]  I think the odds are more likely that Navy SEALs pay a visit to you, Hussein.
[00:44:19.143 --> 00:44:22.766]  But here is Hussein Obama last night on Jimmy Kimmel.
[00:44:24.943 --> 00:44:32.690]  Do you feel that when you congratulated Biden and Senator Harris that you were premature in doing that?
[00:44:34.752 --> 00:44:34.952]  No.
[00:44:35.753 --> 00:44:38.755]  I thought I was right on time.
[00:44:39.356 --> 00:44:39.936]  There seems to be...
[00:44:44.162 --> 00:44:46.464]  The communication system in the White House used to be better.
[00:44:46.804 --> 00:44:47.665]  It was real time.
[00:44:47.745 --> 00:44:55.769]  There's a lot of computers there that actually tell you what is going on around the world.
[00:44:55.889 --> 00:44:57.150]  You know the White House well.
[00:44:57.190 --> 00:44:58.471]  You lived there for eight years.
[00:44:58.591 --> 00:45:05.775]  Are there places someone could hide, like if, say, they were going to be removed?
[00:45:05.795 --> 00:45:08.417]  Are there little cubby holes or anything that you know about?
[00:45:09.656 --> 00:45:15.122]  Well, uh, I think we can always send the Navy SEALs in there to dig him out.
[00:45:15.503 --> 00:45:19.908]  Yeah, do you see how he clutches his throat there a couple times, has to take a deep swallow?
[00:45:20.428 --> 00:45:21.409]  Yeah, he knows.
[00:45:21.449 --> 00:45:22.290]  Get him off the screen.
[00:45:22.330 --> 00:45:24.693]  This is all a giant act, folks.
[00:45:25.374 --> 00:45:27.857]  It's all one big act.
[00:45:29.335 --> 00:45:31.176]  As if Jimmy Kimmel's show is popular.
[00:45:31.737 --> 00:45:34.499]  As if Obama on Jimmy Kimmel is like the hottest thing.
[00:45:34.659 --> 00:45:35.499]  Nobody cares.
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:37.601]  Nobody's watching that crap.
[00:45:38.141 --> 00:45:41.343]  Obama is the most despised president in US history.
[00:45:41.363 --> 00:45:43.125]  He'll go down as the most corrupt.
[00:45:43.505 --> 00:45:45.026]  All they have is their charades.
[00:45:45.186 --> 00:45:46.567]  All they have is their facades.
[00:45:47.848 --> 00:45:51.410]  But they go on TV and smile and laugh to hold the facade up.
[00:45:51.891 --> 00:45:52.091]  No!
[00:45:53.584 --> 00:46:00.027]  No, Barrio, I think the odds are more likely that the Navy SEALs send you to prison for life.
[00:46:01.648 --> 00:46:10.952]  Or send you to testify against the charges coming against you for treason.
[00:46:10.972 --> 00:46:17.856]  No, Barack, I think it's you.
[00:46:19.073 --> 00:46:21.615]  Who may be getting a visit from the Navy SEALs.
[00:46:21.655 --> 00:46:25.078]  I think it's you who may have an extended stay at Guantanamo Bay.
[00:46:27.499 --> 00:46:29.001]  At least if we're weighing the odds.
[00:46:30.161 --> 00:46:32.723]  Trump being visited by the Navy SEALs and removed or arrested?
[00:46:33.044 --> 00:46:34.905]  No, not very high odds on that.
[00:46:36.066 --> 00:46:36.366]  You?
[00:46:36.386 --> 00:46:47.475]  I guarantee you I could have Navy SEALs call into this show right now and they'd say, yeah,
[00:46:49.448 --> 00:46:56.430]  There ain't a chance we're gonna go in and remove Trump from some phony command of Barack Obama.
[00:46:58.851 --> 00:47:01.071]  We do have- is that a live feed from the Capitol, guys?
[00:47:01.932 --> 00:47:02.772]  In Atlanta?
[00:47:04.172 --> 00:47:05.213]  We do have a live feed.
[00:47:05.253 --> 00:47:09.634]  The rally is on right now in Atlanta, the capital of Georgia.
[00:47:09.714 --> 00:47:12.255]  As you can see, there are speakers there, and once again,
[00:47:13.513 --> 00:47:16.134]  Trump supporters and patriots lined up by the hundreds.
[00:47:16.195 --> 00:47:17.395]  It's gathering momentum.
[00:47:18.176 --> 00:47:22.638]  I imagine it's going to be thousands tomorrow.
[00:47:23.899 --> 00:47:25.480]  So we will continue to monitor that.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:32.964]  Again, these are happening nationwide at state capitals at noon on Saturday until Trump is inaugurated.
[00:47:33.604 --> 00:47:37.827]  So if you want to get involved in this, noon at your state capital.
[00:47:38.883 --> 00:47:39.883]  Every Saturday.
[00:47:40.444 --> 00:47:46.425]  So that means, yes, I will be at the state capitol in Austin, Texas tomorrow at noon.
[00:47:47.946 --> 00:47:54.948]  And yes, there will be thousands gathered in Georgia attempting to stop the steal of our election there.
[00:47:55.808 --> 00:48:02.351]  And this is important for all of us to get behind, not just people in Georgia or Michigan or Pennsylvania where the steal is really happening.
[00:48:03.711 --> 00:48:06.492]  Because the steal is against all of us.
[00:48:08.888 --> 00:48:09.228]  All right.
[00:48:11.230 --> 00:48:13.731]  When we come back, I do have some other news I want to get to.
[00:48:14.572 --> 00:48:16.453]  Alex Jones could pop in at any time.
[00:48:17.634 --> 00:48:19.415]  And I may open up the phone lines.
[00:48:20.355 --> 00:48:24.158]  It is Friday, so we may open up the phone lines and take your calls.
[00:48:24.178 --> 00:48:25.359]  We haven't heard much from you this week.
[00:48:25.419 --> 00:48:28.140]  It's the InfoWars.com Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:28.641 --> 00:48:29.181]  Welcome back.
[00:48:29.301 --> 00:48:31.623]  We are in the second hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[00:48:31.663 --> 00:48:33.244]  Owen Schroer sitting in for Alex.
[00:48:34.625 --> 00:48:36.646]  We'll be hearing from Alex before we sign off.
[00:48:39.824 --> 00:48:44.367]  I want to open up the phone lines right now.
[00:48:44.387 --> 00:48:45.548]  877-789-2539.
[00:48:45.568 --> 00:48:46.369]  877-789-2539.
[00:48:46.389 --> 00:49:01.479]  And if there are any Navy SEALs tuned in, or former Navy SEALs, or family members of Navy SEALs, who want to weigh in on Obama saying the Navy SEALs would remove Trump from the White House, we'll put you to the front of the line.
[00:49:01.519 --> 00:49:04.041]  Just, just, you know, just because.
[00:49:04.121 --> 00:49:05.122]  We'll just see how that goes.
[00:49:08.075 --> 00:49:09.176]  I don't think.
[00:49:09.916 --> 00:49:11.337]  See, but it's all the fake news, folks.
[00:49:11.357 --> 00:49:12.017]  That's all they do.
[00:49:12.057 --> 00:49:12.958]  It's all charades.
[00:49:12.998 --> 00:49:14.178]  It's all Baghdad Bob.
[00:49:14.218 --> 00:49:15.359]  It's all Tokyo Rose.
[00:49:15.899 --> 00:49:17.820]  It's all WWE promos.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:19.782]  It's all fake.
[00:49:21.783 --> 00:49:23.043]  Obama is despised.
[00:49:23.223 --> 00:49:24.124]  Nobody likes him.
[00:49:24.284 --> 00:49:25.785]  His own voters can't stand him.
[00:49:25.825 --> 00:49:26.625]  He's a total fraud.
[00:49:26.665 --> 00:49:27.386]  He's a total phony.
[00:49:27.426 --> 00:49:29.387]  He's guilty of treason up one side and down the other.
[00:49:32.298 --> 00:49:36.699]  But he goes on late night comedy shows with Jimmy Kimmel and smiles and laughs!
[00:49:36.759 --> 00:49:37.639]  Ha ha ha ha ha!
[00:49:37.739 --> 00:49:38.380]  Ooh ayee!
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.000]  Ah, Navy SEALS will get Trump!
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:40.440]  Woo hoo hoo!
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:41.960]  It's all fake, folks.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:42.641]  It's all fake.
[00:49:43.161 --> 00:49:44.441]  It's all a giant act.
[00:49:44.721 --> 00:49:45.661]  It's all a PSYOP.
[00:49:47.742 --> 00:49:48.422]  It's all it is.
[00:49:50.022 --> 00:49:51.883]  No, Barack, you know what's coming.
[00:49:52.363 --> 00:49:52.723]  Don't ya?
[00:49:53.963 --> 00:49:55.764]  You know, here's my biggest fear right now.
[00:49:57.389 --> 00:50:03.191]  Aside from how hard it's going to be to stop this steal when it's all done electronically.
[00:50:05.692 --> 00:50:23.139]  You know, the hubris and the arrogance of an Andrew Cuomo in New York, the hubris and the arrogance of a Governor Whitmer, of a Gavin Newsom, a Tom Wolfe,
[00:50:24.795 --> 00:50:29.819]  Saying you have to mask in your home, saying you can't open your business, saying you have to be shut down forever, you can't leave your home.
[00:50:33.562 --> 00:50:38.386]  There's something, there is something to that that's not palpable right now.
[00:50:40.047 --> 00:50:53.278]  And the reason why it's so scary is because they wouldn't be this arrogant and this flippant in their disgust for the American people
[00:50:54.878 --> 00:51:06.141]  And then their blatant tyranny, unless they knew they were safe and there was something else coming.
[00:51:06.521 --> 00:51:21.666]  I just have a weird feeling that their arrogance and their hubris in their totalitarian dictate measures of shutting everything down for a fake pandemic
[00:51:22.608 --> 00:51:30.349]  And then bragging about it, and then going out to dinner without a mask, and having parties without a mask, and Cuomo scolding the media, scolding parents, scolding teachers.
[00:51:31.690 --> 00:51:34.150]  Whitmer, against all laws, locking people down.
[00:51:34.210 --> 00:51:35.410]  Multiple lawsuits against her.
[00:51:35.490 --> 00:51:36.090]  She doesn't care.
[00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:37.611]  Multiple petitions for her to be removed.
[00:51:37.651 --> 00:51:38.271]  She doesn't care.
[00:51:39.951 --> 00:51:43.812]  The Democrat governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Wolf, says you have to wear a mask in your home.
[00:51:44.292 --> 00:51:45.432]  Democrat mayors in St.
[00:51:45.452 --> 00:51:49.112]  Louis and Chicago and New York are saying you can't even leave your home.
[00:51:50.653 --> 00:51:51.473]  That arrogance.
[00:51:52.540 --> 00:52:02.745]  That hubris in your face, disgust, and criminal activity, criminal behavior from them, is a big indicator, folks, that they know something else is coming.
[00:52:03.905 --> 00:52:08.007]  For them to have that much confidence means that they think they're really safeguarded.
[00:52:09.288 --> 00:52:10.568]  Now, it could be a mismeasurement.
[00:52:11.389 --> 00:52:13.810]  They could be just falling for their own PR campaigns.
[00:52:14.130 --> 00:52:15.971]  They could be falling for their own BS.
[00:52:19.008 --> 00:52:20.489]  But they really think they've won.
[00:52:20.589 --> 00:52:22.410]  They really think they're enslaving all Americans.
[00:52:22.450 --> 00:52:23.892]  They really think you're a piece of dirt.
[00:52:23.952 --> 00:52:25.112]  They think you are scum.
[00:52:25.433 --> 00:52:27.354]  You are not even an ant.
[00:52:27.634 --> 00:52:29.215]  You're an ant dropping to these people.
[00:52:29.315 --> 00:52:35.620]  To Cuomo, and Whitmer, and Wolf, and Lightfoot, and Newsom, and yes, Biden.
[00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:43.646]  And they wouldn't be behaving that way unless they thought they have you totally shackled.
[00:52:43.686 --> 00:52:45.267]  They have you totally owned.
[00:52:45.787 --> 00:52:46.708]  They own you.
[00:52:50.046 --> 00:52:54.070]  That arrogance does not come lightly.
[00:52:58.194 --> 00:53:02.758]  And you have Joe Biden, in fact, we'll go to a short clip here.
[00:53:02.818 --> 00:53:05.721]  He had a press conference today in Delaware.
[00:53:06.922 --> 00:53:15.050]  This goon squad, this clown act, this hack, this schmuck, this criminal,
[00:53:16.308 --> 00:53:27.451]  This dementia-ridden hag, this plastic-faced corpse, this rotting husk of a soul, this pathetic excuse for a man.
[00:53:27.471 --> 00:53:31.052]  This is our fake president-elect.
[00:53:31.552 --> 00:53:33.433]  Listen to him fumble and bumble.
[00:53:33.473 --> 00:53:34.873]  He doesn't even know where the hell he is.
[00:53:34.913 --> 00:53:36.954]  He can't think, he can't read, he can't talk.
[00:53:37.694 --> 00:53:44.276]  A fake president-elect scumbag, dirtbag, low-life loser.
[00:53:45.646 --> 00:53:46.827]  Who wants to dominate us?
[00:53:46.887 --> 00:53:48.708]  Here he is today, the fake president-elect.
[00:53:50.009 --> 00:53:54.052]  We talked a lot with the governors about what the immediate needs are.
[00:53:54.573 --> 00:54:05.181]  We're going to enforce the, excuse me, employ the Defense Reconstructive Act to be able to go out there and dictate companies
[00:54:05.721 --> 00:54:07.582]  Build and do following things.
[00:54:07.942 --> 00:54:09.143]  We need much more testing.
[00:54:09.183 --> 00:54:10.484]  We need much more masking.
[00:54:10.544 --> 00:54:30.816]  I mean, that's more we need gloves I asked the beast to go and ask the National Government Association through the governor Cuomo and the ones on the line to let us know what their shortages are what this pathetic Just pathetic and There were other gaffes in his little press conference today.
[00:54:30.836 --> 00:54:32.357]  I mean this guy's just a joke man.
[00:54:32.377 --> 00:54:32.397]  I
[00:54:34.264 --> 00:54:37.386]  And I'll tell you what, our country's a joke that he is not in jail.
[00:54:42.490 --> 00:54:43.511]  Really embarrassing, isn't it?
[00:54:44.672 --> 00:54:46.393]  Look at some of Joe Biden's tweets today.
[00:54:48.775 --> 00:54:55.541]  At least 37 transgender and gender non-conforming people have been killed this year.
[00:54:56.567 --> 00:54:59.068]  By the way, hundreds of them commit suicide, but they never talk about that.
[00:54:59.848 --> 00:55:02.369]  Most of them black and brown transgender women!
[00:55:02.429 --> 00:55:04.749]  Yeah, because they're the ones that are targeted for this by the propaganda.
[00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:06.430]  It's intolerable!
[00:55:07.610 --> 00:55:10.251]  This Transgender Day of Remembrance!
[00:55:11.711 --> 00:55:16.433]  We honor their lives and recommit to the work that remains to end this epidemic of violence.
[00:55:16.953 --> 00:55:17.973]  Total fake news!
[00:55:18.133 --> 00:55:19.134]  Total fake story!
[00:55:19.774 --> 00:55:20.534]  Nobody cares!
[00:55:20.654 --> 00:55:21.334]  Nobody knows!
[00:55:21.414 --> 00:55:21.935]  It's nothing!
[00:55:21.975 --> 00:55:22.855]  It's a nothing burger!
[00:55:22.895 --> 00:55:23.215]  But see,
[00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:27.351]  And of course, there's no political pull here.
[00:55:27.651 --> 00:55:28.651]  It's all pandering.
[00:55:28.831 --> 00:55:30.572]  It's all insulting humanity.
[00:55:30.612 --> 00:55:32.213]  It's all part of the social engineering.
[00:55:33.714 --> 00:55:37.476]  Normalizing, sexually mutilating your child.
[00:55:37.956 --> 00:55:42.359]  Normalizing the sexual, psychological rape of your child.
[00:55:44.909 --> 00:55:50.072]  And of course it's Joe Biden, the guy whose first act in celebrating he was a president was molesting a child.
[00:55:50.432 --> 00:55:51.293]  He's showing you!
[00:55:51.373 --> 00:55:53.134]  Joe Biden is a child molester!
[00:55:53.835 --> 00:56:00.959]  He announces he wins president, they bring out a baby, clear the whole stage, he molests the baby on stage, on camera, and then they all celebrate and come in and join him.
[00:56:01.199 --> 00:56:03.481]  It's all a satanic cult act, folks!
[00:56:05.242 --> 00:56:11.946]  Joe Biden goes on TV, yeah, I bribed the Ukrainian government to get my son millions of dollars, screw you, I'm frickin' Joe Biden, I run this show!
[00:56:14.318 --> 00:56:23.185]  Yeah, I like kids so much they crawl on my legs and I like molesting them and jumping them up and down and I grab their wives' butts and boobs and all their children's faces and necks and sniff them and lick them.
[00:56:23.466 --> 00:56:24.046]  That's what I do!
[00:56:24.106 --> 00:56:25.167]  I'm Joe Biden, bitch!
[00:56:28.930 --> 00:56:29.250]  Sick.
[00:56:31.032 --> 00:56:31.352]  Sick.
[00:56:32.333 --> 00:56:37.817]  A child molesting, psychological torturing demon.
[00:56:41.408 --> 00:56:44.190]  And then he says, by the way, they stole this one from President Trump.
[00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:47.472]  Wearing a mask isn't a political statement.
[00:56:47.612 --> 00:56:49.153]  It's a patriotic duty.
[00:56:49.533 --> 00:56:50.774]  That's what Trump said three months ago.
[00:56:50.934 --> 00:56:54.436]  I disagreed with him then, but it's funny now they steal it and they say, oh, it's patriotic to wear a mask.
[00:56:56.117 --> 00:56:57.498]  I'm so sick of this crap, man.
[00:56:57.518 --> 00:56:59.700]  You know what?
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:00.460]  Here's the good news.
[00:57:03.662 --> 00:57:05.243]  America's not just going to go into tyranny.
[00:57:05.863 --> 00:57:06.904]  We may win this battle.
[00:57:06.944 --> 00:57:07.745]  We may save America.
[00:57:07.805 --> 00:57:08.305]  We may not.
[00:57:09.085 --> 00:57:09.626]  But, um,
[00:57:11.186 --> 00:57:23.144]  You know, I'm not the one that has about 100 million people ready to, uh, you know, find me and end me.
[00:57:25.151 --> 00:57:26.612]  No, I'm not the tyrant in government.
[00:57:26.992 --> 00:57:28.552]  No, I'm not the one that shut down your business.
[00:57:28.592 --> 00:57:30.213]  No, I'm not the one that censored your free speech.
[00:57:30.473 --> 00:57:33.034]  No, I'm not the one that spent trillions of dollars on wars.
[00:57:33.294 --> 00:57:35.554]  No, I'm not the one that lied about weapons of mass destruction.
[00:57:35.855 --> 00:57:37.875]  No, I'm not the one that lied about Russian collusion.
[00:57:38.155 --> 00:57:39.656]  No, I'm not the one that lied about Kavanaugh.
[00:57:39.736 --> 00:57:41.116]  I'm not the one that lied about hate crimes.
[00:57:41.396 --> 00:57:42.137]  I'm not the liar.
[00:57:42.377 --> 00:57:43.137]  I'm not the fraud.
[00:57:43.317 --> 00:57:44.197]  That's Joe Biden.
[00:57:44.397 --> 00:57:45.238]  That's CNN.
[00:57:45.398 --> 00:57:46.458]  That's MSNBC.
[00:57:46.518 --> 00:57:48.779]  So, you guys can go ahead and try to roll out this tyranny.
[00:57:49.099 --> 00:58:00.163]  You can continue on with this fake pandemic, you can try to steal this election, but every day you continue this, another million Americans gets red in their eyes and smoke out of their ears, and they're looking at you!
[00:58:00.423 --> 00:58:01.604]  They're looking at you, Joe!
[00:58:01.904 --> 00:58:02.664]  They're looking at you!
[00:58:02.684 --> 00:58:05.145]  You know, I'm gonna try to calm down here.
[00:58:05.285 --> 00:58:07.426]  I just have zero tolerance for tyrants.
[00:58:09.027 --> 00:58:14.549]  And, um... Just no-holds-barred here on air, and...
[00:58:16.653 --> 00:58:20.837]  Joe Biden and the people that own him are enemies of you.
[00:58:21.237 --> 00:58:23.179]  They want to take everything from you.
[00:58:25.100 --> 00:58:26.582]  They want to destroy your family.
[00:58:26.602 --> 00:58:28.183]  They want to destroy your livelihood.
[00:58:28.203 --> 00:58:29.684]  They want to destroy your country, folks.
[00:58:29.724 --> 00:58:30.925]  So, it's a little hard.
[00:58:30.985 --> 00:58:31.686]  Okay, I'm going to be honest.
[00:58:31.726 --> 00:58:39.413]  It's a little hard covering these tyrants and having to deal with the reality that they want to dominate us and they are feet away
[00:58:40.779 --> 00:58:41.559]  From Total Tyranny.
[00:58:41.579 --> 00:58:51.642]  They are feet away from being in charge of a global government infrastructure that will, without a doubt, make you poor and hungry and broke with nothing.
[00:58:54.963 --> 00:59:08.267]  So, it's a tough thing to sit here and deal with this and cover this and not call it like it is and cross that boundary of what needs to happen and not get
[00:59:09.961 --> 00:59:14.087]  Flagrantly angry because it is infuriating.
[00:59:16.109 --> 00:59:26.403]  We spend trillions of dollars to fight wars in countries halfway around the planet when the biggest enemies of our country are sitting in the halls of Congress.
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:30.321]  And governor mansions and mayor mansions.
[00:59:30.581 --> 00:59:31.602]  They are the real enemies.
[00:59:31.942 --> 00:59:34.723]  Yeah, we should be sending the Navy Seals after Barack Obama.
[00:59:34.963 --> 00:59:41.687]  Yeah, we should be sending the military in to arrest Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer and Tom Wolfe and Lori Lightfoot.
[00:59:42.067 --> 00:59:44.088]  And yes, Joe Biden.
[00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:55.314]  And yet these criminals, these enemies of humanity, these enemies of freedom, these enemies of truth, these enemies of righteousness,
[00:59:57.102 --> 01:00:00.204]  Are inches away from owning you!
[01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:06.468]  So I get a little upset, but I'm going to take a deep breath and I'm going to go to the callers.
[01:00:07.829 --> 01:00:11.892]  Real quick though, ladies and gentlemen, we are monitoring the Stop the Steal rally in Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:00:11.972 --> 01:00:14.193]  We are going to be nationwide.

[01:00:19.036 --> 01:00:21.798]  Ladies and gentlemen, get in to the battle now.
[01:00:21.858 --> 01:00:22.679]  Get into the arena.
[01:00:22.739 --> 01:00:25.881]  Fight for your country now before Joe Biden kills it.

[01:01:04.992 --> 01:01:06.333]  Let's start in Georgia.
[01:01:06.673 --> 01:01:08.094]  Ian in Georgia.
[01:01:08.154 --> 01:01:11.056]  You're on the InfoWars Alex Jones Show.
[01:01:11.076 --> 01:01:11.376]  Go ahead.
[01:01:12.714 --> 01:01:18.360]  Hey Owen, I'm 23 years old and I listen to you guys every day and I love what you do, so thank you.
[01:01:20.041 --> 01:01:26.848]  I voted for Kemp in 2018 and I was pretty proud of him for not implementing mask mandates and having a relatively short lockdown.
[01:01:27.689 --> 01:01:32.733]  But if he certifies this election without calling a special session, he'll lose in 2022.
[01:01:33.494 --> 01:01:36.998]  He's not going to stab Trump and his supporters in the back and get away with it.
[01:01:37.705 --> 01:01:42.866]  And you know, that's another one of my fears here, Ian, is that why would Kemp do that?
[01:01:42.946 --> 01:01:44.406]  Why would he betray his own people?
[01:01:44.486 --> 01:01:46.987]  Why would he cost himself his own election?
[01:01:47.407 --> 01:01:56.729]  Unless they're so confident in what's ever coming, they just figure, it doesn't matter what I do, it doesn't matter what I say, it doesn't matter if the entire population hates me, this thing is coming anyway, so damn it all to hell.
[01:01:58.189 --> 01:02:01.850]  Yeah, the only thing I can think of is he's bought and paid for it, which is pretty sad.
[01:02:03.134 --> 01:02:05.715]  Yeah, our governor here, Governor Abbott, betrayed us too.
[01:02:05.795 --> 01:02:08.096]  You know, I heard a rumor he doesn't stand for the National Anthem.
[01:02:11.877 --> 01:02:12.517]  You got that one?
[01:02:12.537 --> 01:02:13.398]  That's pretty brutal.
[01:02:13.638 --> 01:02:14.598]  Yeah, that's pretty brutal.
[01:02:14.658 --> 01:02:18.959]  Sorry, hey, that guy locked down my state, you know, makes me wear a face mask, so screw him.
[01:02:18.979 --> 01:02:20.460]  I don't blame you.
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:27.582]  But yeah, it is very worrisome that these Republicans are so willing to just throw their entire constituency under the bus.
[01:02:27.983 --> 01:02:29.463]  What do they know that we don't know?
[01:02:29.803 --> 01:02:31.344]  Why are they so confident to do that?
[01:02:31.584 --> 01:02:32.004]  Scares me.
[01:02:34.411 --> 01:02:35.152]  They'll pay the price.
[01:02:37.533 --> 01:02:38.614]  Well, that's for damn sure.
[01:02:40.996 --> 01:02:41.657]  Anything else, Ian?
[01:02:41.977 --> 01:02:43.999]  To the Georgia State Capitol on Saturday.
[01:02:44.039 --> 01:02:44.819]  I'll be there tomorrow.
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:46.741]  Right on, man.
[01:02:47.101 --> 01:02:47.521]  Right on.
[01:02:47.641 --> 01:02:48.402]  Alex will be there.
[01:02:48.442 --> 01:02:49.523]  Nick Fuentes will be there.
[01:02:50.023 --> 01:02:51.364]  Ollie Alexander will be there.
[01:02:51.985 --> 01:02:53.106]  Jay Dyer is there.
[01:02:53.126 --> 01:02:53.746]  A ton of people.
[01:02:53.766 --> 01:02:54.347]  It's going to be huge.
[01:02:54.367 --> 01:02:55.187]  It's going to be huge, Ian.
[01:02:55.508 --> 01:02:56.569]  Thank you so much for calling in.
[01:02:57.149 --> 01:02:59.551]  Let's go to Cedric in Alabama.
[01:02:59.671 --> 01:03:01.613]  Cedric, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:03:01.633 --> 01:03:01.933]  Go ahead.
[01:03:03.223 --> 01:03:04.524]  What's going on, Owens?
[01:03:04.624 --> 01:03:05.484]  God bless you, man.
[01:03:06.545 --> 01:03:06.865]  Thank you.
[01:03:06.885 --> 01:03:07.445]  God bless you.
[01:03:09.346 --> 01:03:16.470]  Listen, I'm calling upon all Republicans, all conservatives, all patriots in Alabama.
[01:03:17.071 --> 01:03:18.131]  We're right next door.
[01:03:18.791 --> 01:03:25.255]  Come tomorrow with me to that political battlefield that is Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:03:26.276 --> 01:03:32.479]  We cannot continue to allow these political chameleons, like the governor of Alabama,
[01:03:32.881 --> 01:03:43.110]  We have said nothing in support of President Trump or any Republican for that matter in these state legislatures and these governor's mansions.
[01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:45.612]  Now's the hour of action.
[01:03:46.312 --> 01:03:48.995]  Either you support America or you don't.
[01:03:49.555 --> 01:03:52.658]  We don't have time for these games anymore.
[01:03:53.819 --> 01:03:56.301]  We have to rally tomorrow.
[01:03:57.041 --> 01:03:58.463]  Regulators mount up.
[01:03:59.183 --> 01:04:00.084]  Now's the time.
[01:04:00.164 --> 01:04:01.185]  America needs us.
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.041]  So we need to show up.
[01:04:04.182 --> 01:04:08.706]  Either we can sit here and talk all day, or we're going to defend liberty.
[01:04:09.587 --> 01:04:14.311]  Because this is about globalism versus everyone else.
[01:04:15.392 --> 01:04:16.993]  It's just that simple, Owen.
[01:04:18.334 --> 01:04:22.758]  And I can't emphasize this enough, and this is not a call to action.
[01:04:23.612 --> 01:04:25.773]  This is just the truth of the matter.
[01:04:26.233 --> 01:04:33.676]  Folks, you can either stand up and peacefully fight for America now, maybe for two, three, maybe another year max.
[01:04:34.356 --> 01:04:37.037]  The only way to get America back after that is going to be an armed revolution.
[01:04:37.558 --> 01:04:37.898]  Period.
[01:04:38.118 --> 01:04:38.598]  End of sentence.
[01:04:39.538 --> 01:04:41.179]  So again, I'm not calling for that.
[01:04:41.439 --> 01:04:42.420]  I don't want to be a part of that.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:48.562]  But rest assured, the American people will do what is necessary to save this republic.
[01:04:48.622 --> 01:04:50.723]  So you can either fight peacefully,
[01:04:51.837 --> 01:05:06.150]  With civil disobedience, and organizing and activating in the streets now, and sharing links and awakening your friends and family, or... I would say within the next year, the only way to save this country, if they put Kamala Harris in, folks, it's game over.
[01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:10.454]  They're gonna lock down everything, you won't even have a country anymore, and it will become an armed conflict!
[01:05:10.835 --> 01:05:11.896]  I don't wanna see that happen.
[01:05:12.176 --> 01:05:14.078]  That's why I'm telling people to get activated now.
[01:05:16.039 --> 01:05:17.681]  So many things that we can do.
[01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:22.743]  If you can't physically be in Georgia tomorrow, you go to your state capitol.
[01:05:23.243 --> 01:05:25.704]  There's always an excuse, but guess what?
[01:05:26.665 --> 01:05:30.467]  American liberty is just one excuse away from tyranny.
[01:05:31.107 --> 01:05:33.669]  This is the fight that we were created for.
[01:05:34.189 --> 01:05:40.633]  That's why we were put here in a time as this, to either stand up or to bow down.
[01:05:40.973 --> 01:05:41.774]  But guess what?
[01:05:42.314 --> 01:05:45.776]  In Alabama, our state motto is, we dare defend our rights.
[01:05:47.265 --> 01:05:52.452]  As American citizens, our knees are not supposed to bend so easily.
[01:05:53.194 --> 01:05:55.857]  Stand up now politically and get active.
[01:05:56.618 --> 01:05:57.179]  Show up.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:05:59.663]  Do the work now.
[01:06:00.518 --> 01:06:10.487]  Because in the future, it's going to be our children and our grandchildren that has to suffer because the excuses that we created, that we made today.
[01:06:11.047 --> 01:06:11.688]  Thank you, Owen.
[01:06:12.208 --> 01:06:12.769]  Absolutely.
[01:06:12.809 --> 01:06:19.474]  And just look at the state of the schools right now, where they're making kids wear masks, hide behind plexiglass barriers.
[01:06:19.494 --> 01:06:21.156]  That's even if they get to go to school.
[01:06:22.193 --> 01:06:29.241]  But again, folks, people that, I mean, they probably haven't even heard of Infowars particularly in New York or California that are dealing with this tyranny.
[01:06:29.281 --> 01:06:30.943]  Folks, they are fighting mad.
[01:06:31.243 --> 01:06:32.164]  They don't have a voice yet.
[01:06:33.186 --> 01:06:36.068]  They're still trying to, you know, they're just dizzy from how mad they are.
[01:06:36.088 --> 01:06:39.229]  I mean, these people are going to realize what's going on real soon.
[01:06:39.249 --> 01:06:40.270]  But that's what's so scary.
[01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:42.311]  Newsom and Cuomo, they're so arrogant.
[01:06:42.751 --> 01:06:43.392]  What do they know?
[01:06:44.012 --> 01:06:46.593]  We're back here at the Alex Jones Show.
[01:06:46.994 --> 01:06:48.394]  I've seen Philip Anderson speak.
[01:06:48.414 --> 01:06:52.296]  We've got other people speaking right now live from the Capitol in Georgia.
[01:06:52.377 --> 01:06:54.077]  Again, ladies and gentlemen, get involved.
[01:06:54.538 --> 01:06:58.540]  Your state capitol this Saturday at noon.
[01:07:00.450 --> 01:07:02.872]  I will be here in Austin, Texas at the State Capitol.
[01:07:02.952 --> 01:07:14.200]  I know there are people coming to join me, but the big event, the big rally is in Atlanta, Georgia, and we are just covering some of that right now with the live feed.
[01:07:14.681 --> 01:07:21.766]  You know, maybe it's time we all moved to South Dakota, where Kristi Noem is the governor.
[01:07:21.906 --> 01:07:23.107]  A hero, a patriot.
[01:07:24.127 --> 01:07:27.173]  Doesn't want to lock down her state, doesn't want to force you to wear a mask.
[01:07:27.754 --> 01:07:32.062]  Here she is talking about that during a press conference today.
[01:07:34.274 --> 01:07:39.099]  There are many states that do have mask mandates in place, and some that do not.
[01:07:39.999 --> 01:07:45.804]  But I look at their rate of spread, and the fact is that cases are increasing in many of those states as well.
[01:07:45.824 --> 01:07:52.430]  If you look at Wisconsin, they've had a mask mandate since August, and they have a higher rate of spread than the state of South Dakota.
[01:07:52.470 --> 01:07:56.414]  You look at Montana, they've had a mask mandate in place since July.
[01:07:56.894 --> 01:08:01.078]  Both of those states have higher rates of spread than the state of South Dakota.
[01:08:01.738 --> 01:08:04.842]  When you look at Wyoming, it has the fastest spread in the nation.
[01:08:05.803 --> 01:08:08.606]  And that is the concern that I have as many times.
[01:08:09.527 --> 01:08:15.194]  I don't want to approach a policy or a mandate just looking to make people feel good.
[01:08:15.214 --> 01:08:16.936]  I want to do good.
[01:08:17.236 --> 01:08:20.698]  And actually put forward provisions that make a difference for families.
[01:08:21.219 --> 01:08:27.243]  And these local communities have some flexibility today that Sioux Falls can make a different decision than Rapid City.
[01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:30.465]  Rapid City can make a different decision than Lemon, South Dakota.
[01:08:30.505 --> 01:08:33.187]  Watertown can make a different decision than Pierre.
[01:08:33.667 --> 01:08:39.171]  And that's what some of these local leaders are doing in reacting to the people in the community based on what they want.
[01:08:41.852 --> 01:08:42.273]  The best.
[01:08:44.374 --> 01:08:45.795]  Noam, DeSantis, I mean,
[01:08:47.708 --> 01:08:52.254]  Am I missing a- who's a better governor than Kristi Noem or Ron DeSantis right now?
[01:08:53.977 --> 01:08:54.057]  Ah.
[01:08:55.259 --> 01:08:56.981]  They're leading the charge as far as I can tell.
[01:08:58.864 --> 01:09:00.225]  And it's pathetic, though, that-
[01:09:01.127 --> 01:09:03.729]  That's, I mean, like, wow.
[01:09:03.769 --> 01:09:07.552]  That should be normal behavior from your governor, but that's, like, considered heroic now.
[01:09:07.572 --> 01:09:15.499]  It's like, yeah, you know, I can't force people to shut down their business, I can't force people to wear a mask, and I'm looking at the data and it doesn't even work, and you know what?
[01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:19.282]  If other cities want to run things their own way, you know, they can do that too, that's how it works around here.
[01:09:19.462 --> 01:09:20.623]  You're like, oh my gosh!
[01:09:20.844 --> 01:09:22.105]  A governor that loves freedom!
[01:09:22.325 --> 01:09:22.785]  Wow!
[01:09:23.986 --> 01:09:25.467]  A governor that wants to live in reality!
[01:09:25.507 --> 01:09:25.828]  Wow!
[01:09:25.888 --> 01:09:27.369]  And not a tyrant for a governor!
[01:09:27.449 --> 01:09:28.110]  Oh, thank God!
[01:09:29.636 --> 01:09:31.957]  Should we all just move to South Dakota?
[01:09:31.997 --> 01:09:33.078]  Everybody just move to Florida?
[01:09:35.299 --> 01:09:39.822]  Man, I'll tell you, if I didn't hate winter, I'd probably move to South Dakota tomorrow.
[01:09:39.882 --> 01:09:40.602]  I'm not even kidding you.
[01:09:40.622 --> 01:09:41.382]  I just hate winter.
[01:09:41.543 --> 01:09:42.403]  I cannot deal with it.
[01:09:42.523 --> 01:09:43.103]  I don't like winter.
[01:09:43.564 --> 01:09:45.185]  I'd rather be 100 degrees all year long.
[01:09:45.205 --> 01:09:47.826]  Alright, I'm getting off track.
[01:09:47.886 --> 01:09:51.088]  Let's get back to your phone calls.
[01:09:52.348 --> 01:09:54.390]  And we have Jamie in North Dakota.
[01:09:54.470 --> 01:09:56.311]  Jamie, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:09:56.331 --> 01:09:56.691]  Go ahead.
[01:09:58.137 --> 01:10:15.551]  Hi, I wanted to speak to, first of all, all of us in the Midwest who think this can't affect us, and also to reach out to the mothers out there, because you guys do a really great job, but I really want mothers to hear what's going on in our little state of North Dakota.
[01:10:15.591 --> 01:10:26.239]  We have 765,000 residents, and of course, as soon as Doug Burgum was re-elected, he threw down a mask mandate and said that our kids needed to go to school with it.
[01:10:26.719 --> 01:10:34.247]  Everybody started freaking out about a $1,000 fine, but what they're missing was that statute that they cited was a Class C felony.
[01:10:34.687 --> 01:10:38.992]  Now, the people that are going to rise up against that are conservatives, right?
[01:10:39.012 --> 01:10:44.317]  So basically, if you get slapped with that fine, they're taking away your right to vote and your right to have guns.
[01:10:44.878 --> 01:10:46.600]  That's the first thing that I want to point out.
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:50.061]  Once they slapped that on the kids at school, I was done.
[01:10:50.081 --> 01:10:51.742]  I went and I called the state senator.
[01:10:51.762 --> 01:11:02.067]  I talked to the senator and he said that his hands were kind of tied, and what had happened was USA Today did an article about how horrible we are up here, which we're not, by the way.
[01:11:02.087 --> 01:11:03.287]  We have 289 people in the hospital.
[01:11:03.307 --> 01:11:03.568]  That is it.
[01:11:07.409 --> 01:11:13.153]  Well look, the whole COVID thing, the fact we even talk about it like it's a real issue is a psyop in and of itself.
[01:11:13.753 --> 01:11:16.095]  It's the flu, it's, I mean, name anything.
[01:11:16.115 --> 01:11:17.335]  You don't lock down for anything.
[01:11:17.355 --> 01:11:19.056]  We don't lock down for tuberculosis.
[01:11:19.397 --> 01:11:21.438]  We don't lock down for Ebola.
[01:11:21.458 --> 01:11:23.639]  We don't lock, I mean, so it's just, why COVID?
[01:11:23.679 --> 01:11:24.680]  It's all a big sham.
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:26.481]  It's all a big planned scandemic.
[01:11:27.577 --> 01:11:32.079]  Now, all of this sexual stuff you've been talking about, this is another warning I want to go out.
[01:11:32.499 --> 01:11:33.580]  It can happen anywhere.
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:39.522]  When I signed my son up for school, I talked to her about these sexual lessons coming into their school.
[01:11:39.542 --> 01:11:42.183]  They said, no, we're so conservative, that would never happen.
[01:11:42.604 --> 01:11:48.066]  I'm going to read you one line from my son's first week of school that I found in his backpack.
[01:11:48.706 --> 01:11:54.709]  Jonah's mother explained that all people develop sexual desires, which they need to control by taking pills.
[01:11:56.181 --> 01:11:57.121]  Are you okay with that?
[01:11:57.141 --> 01:11:57.802]  Because I'm not.
[01:11:59.062 --> 01:12:04.425]  So, not only are they sexualizing your kid, they're also wanting to turn him into a drug addict.
[01:12:05.505 --> 01:12:12.148]  Well, and take pills, which will probably, you know, affect their reproductive ability in the future, which means they won't reproduce.
[01:12:12.508 --> 01:12:13.849]  There's so many things going on.
[01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:15.830]  People are not looking into this.
[01:12:15.890 --> 01:12:19.551]  The mothers, especially across the Midwest, need to have a voice.
[01:12:19.891 --> 01:12:24.093]  If you want me to be that voice, you just let me know, because I know this stuff inside and out.
[01:12:24.293 --> 01:12:25.474]  You guys do a great job.
[01:12:25.754 --> 01:12:27.135]  But we need to reach some women.
[01:12:27.195 --> 01:12:30.218]  We need to reach some mothers and let them know what's going on inside.
[01:12:30.238 --> 01:12:35.903]  Well ma'am, I completely agree and you are very well spoken and obviously have a deep understanding of these issues.
[01:12:36.023 --> 01:12:37.064]  Here's the problem, Jamie.
[01:12:37.784 --> 01:12:40.126]  I don't even have the crew to go do an event tomorrow.
[01:12:40.587 --> 01:12:40.927]  So like,
[01:12:41.107 --> 01:12:47.332]  We have so many great people that call in and we have so many great people that, you know, reach out via email and they have all these great ideas.
[01:12:47.612 --> 01:12:48.633]  I wish I could do all of them.
[01:12:48.893 --> 01:12:50.074]  It'd be a massive success.
[01:12:50.354 --> 01:12:51.255]  We don't have the capacity.
[01:12:51.275 --> 01:12:56.759]  So, Jamie, my suggestion is start a YouTube channel, start an account on Parler, start something, start doing your own thing.
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:13:00.262]  Maybe we start picking up your reports, playing them during some of the segments.
[01:13:00.823 --> 01:13:03.244]  Because, again, people come to me with great ideas.
[01:13:03.285 --> 01:13:04.245]  Jamie, God bless your heart.
[01:13:04.285 --> 01:13:07.027]  You're very well spoken and we need this information out there.
[01:13:07.808 --> 01:13:11.692]  We can't even, we can't even do half the stuff we need to do around here right now.
[01:13:12.252 --> 01:13:18.739]  So, um, you know, like I said, just the best bet is to just do stuff yourself and then hope that we pick it up and amplify it.
[01:13:19.099 --> 01:13:22.062]  And then that's kind of the osmosis of success around here.
[01:13:22.663 --> 01:13:23.483]  Jamie, God bless you.
[01:13:23.503 --> 01:13:24.344]  Thank you so much for the call.
[01:13:24.364 --> 01:13:25.385]  I hope I hear from Jamie again.
[01:13:25.646 --> 01:13:27.327]  Let's go to Carlos in Texas.
[01:13:27.928 --> 01:13:29.469]  Carlos, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:13:29.489 --> 01:13:29.810]  Go ahead.
[01:13:30.706 --> 01:13:31.947]  Alright, uh, hello Owen.
[01:13:32.247 --> 01:13:34.708]  Uh, 20 years old here, long time listener since middle school.
[01:13:34.808 --> 01:13:36.148]  And I wanted to cover a couple topics.
[01:13:36.348 --> 01:13:38.169]  Mainly, uh, beginning with China.
[01:13:38.809 --> 01:13:47.573]  On November 11th, China deployed, uh, a DEW, which is a direct energy weapon against India, making them inside of a mountain and making them run out.
[01:13:47.613 --> 01:13:51.354]  Yeah, I'm sorry, I have to, I just want to pause you right there because I gotta tell the crew to look this up.
[01:13:52.415 --> 01:13:53.495]  This is one of the craziest things.
[01:13:54.235 --> 01:13:55.376]  Carlos is talking about this.
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:14:12.991]  I didn't really see it covered in any mainstream news, so I'm a little skeptical, but there are pictures of China using basically a mass microwave energy beam weapon to just vaporize an entire squadron of Indian soldiers.
[01:14:13.471 --> 01:14:15.453]  But Carlos, I just wanted to tell the crew to try to look that up.
[01:14:15.473 --> 01:14:17.414]  So go back, start from the beginning, what you're talking about here.
[01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:29.894]  But regardless if it's true or not, they are still researching how to use these direct energy weapons, and they are deploying them in space, is my theory, you know, and I think that Trump knows that, and that's why he created the Space Force, like, last year, I think.
[01:14:30.194 --> 01:14:30.894]  Oh, absolutely!
[01:14:31.034 --> 01:14:36.297]  Well, they came out with a Pentagon report that China is already implementing and deploying weather weapons.
[01:14:36.937 --> 01:14:40.599]  I suspect that they're hitting us with these hurricanes in the South that are unnaturally forming.
[01:14:41.417 --> 01:15:01.242]  Dude yeah definitely but at the same time the United States is doing the same research with DARPA and other organizations within our own government and I think they've been using it against the people and along with the China thing and like not just these direct energy weapons are they deploying on the people but they're also creating or committing crimes against humanity that the UN knows about, the United States knows about,
[01:15:02.401 --> 01:15:03.102]  We're good to go.
[01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:33.448]  Should have ended this a long time ago.
[01:15:33.468 --> 01:15:35.980]  I think that we need to stop having so much faith in Trump.
[01:15:36.627 --> 01:15:42.110]  You know, he keeps playing into the game of the vaccine, the mask, all that is BS, man.
[01:15:42.310 --> 01:15:48.573]  Yeah, well, we're gonna have to find out in the next three months whether or not we continue to rely on Trump for anything.
[01:15:48.893 --> 01:15:59.559]  Either he's the president for the next four years and we can kind of, you know, continue to try to move things in the right direction with Trump, or he's not even the president and we have to move on without him and he'll have to blaze his own show from there.
[01:15:59.959 --> 01:16:03.341]  But Carlos, a 20-year-old in Texas, wow, very well spoken, Carlos.
[01:16:03.381 --> 01:16:05.082]  Thank you for calling.
[01:16:05.602 --> 01:16:11.110]  That is a live shot from Atlanta, Georgia, where Alex is rallying the troops again.
[01:16:11.130 --> 01:16:12.752]  Let's briefly pop in live.
[01:16:13.913 --> 01:16:23.306]  The court has been proven and we demand that Georgia and Michigan and others have a legislative emergency session.
[01:16:24.807 --> 01:16:28.809]  They have now said that Detroit is not certified and was a fraud.
[01:16:29.629 --> 01:16:31.450]  So are many counties in Georgia.
[01:16:31.910 --> 01:16:36.412]  We need the governor not to listen to the other operatives in the state.
[01:16:36.952 --> 01:16:41.134]  We demand the legislature start an emergency session.
[01:16:42.074 --> 01:16:44.335]  Emergency session now!
[01:16:45.015 --> 01:16:47.416]  Emergency session now!
[01:16:47.996 --> 01:16:50.397]  Emergency session now!
[01:16:50.977 --> 01:16:53.377]  Emergency session now!
[01:16:53.898 --> 01:16:54.738]  Emergency session now!
[01:16:54.758 --> 01:16:59.659]  So again, this is in Atlanta, Georgia, where the Democrats are trying to steal the state of Georgia.
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:02.400]  Or I guess you could say already have stolen it.
[01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:03.340]  They declared it for Biden.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:08.302]  He didn't win it, but... This is the tyranny we're in, folks.
[01:17:08.402 --> 01:17:11.083]  This is the corrupt establishment
[01:17:11.929 --> 01:17:12.729]  Going from broke.
[01:17:14.390 --> 01:17:18.653]  And they're betting that we, the American people, will sit here and take it.
[01:17:22.055 --> 01:17:24.996]  So far, they've been right.
[01:17:27.237 --> 01:17:29.999]  But the momentum is growing in our favor.
[01:17:31.139 --> 01:17:34.461]  But now it's just a race through time.
[01:17:35.622 --> 01:17:38.704]  Who can get to the point of no return first?
[01:17:40.324 --> 01:17:41.005]  Will it be them?
[01:17:42.332 --> 01:17:51.714]  The world government, enslavement, tyrannical forces, or will it be us, we, the people, for human freedom and liberty worldwide?
[01:17:52.194 --> 01:17:53.834]  Let's go back out to the phone lines.
[01:17:54.014 --> 01:17:55.555]  Jesse in Arizona.
[01:17:55.615 --> 01:17:56.515]  Jesse, you're on the air.
[01:17:56.555 --> 01:17:56.955]  Go ahead.
[01:17:56.975 --> 01:17:58.615]  Hi, Owen.
[01:17:58.635 --> 01:18:03.156]  I liked what you were saying earlier about Obama seeming pretty smug and you not liking that.
[01:18:03.256 --> 01:18:06.297]  And I've agreed this whole hoax or most of the way through.
[01:18:08.155 --> 01:18:14.798]  The Obama, Colbert, whoever it is, Gates, and his wife, they seem awfully confident.
[01:18:15.299 --> 01:18:17.080]  And we've got to keep our eyes on the ball.
[01:18:17.480 --> 01:18:19.421]  I hear, we've got to fight, we've got to stay in the fight.
[01:18:20.301 --> 01:18:22.542]  The fight's been won for 2,000 years.
[01:18:23.103 --> 01:18:26.344]  We've got to keep our eyes on the way, the truth, and the life that is Jesus Christ.
[01:18:26.384 --> 01:18:30.466]  Because at the end of the day, we're all going to be judged by God alone.
[01:18:32.293 --> 01:18:42.343]  It doesn't matter whether we're bullhorning and we've got 12 years of food buried and guns up the wazoo, or whether we're Bill Gates, it's by faith alone and not of works.
[01:18:42.544 --> 01:18:49.791]  And I think people are missing that in this, because in order for biblical prophecy to be fulfilled, America must fall.
[01:18:49.851 --> 01:18:55.457]  The one world government system, whether it's, you know, Biden gets in and it's a shoo-in, or whether Trump, you know,
[01:18:55.937 --> 01:18:56.518]  Anything else, Jesse?
[01:19:25.973 --> 01:19:26.854]  Nope, that's it for now.
[01:19:26.874 --> 01:19:30.296]  All right, thank you so much for the call.
[01:19:30.476 --> 01:19:39.983]  There's no doubt that when America lost its touch with God and its Christian roots, it definitely went in a bad direction.
[01:19:40.204 --> 01:19:50.992]  And you know, I was thinking about this actually really deeply last night, and I realized how Christianity is actually under such assault right now, and we don't even really see it.
[01:19:55.155 --> 01:19:55.335]  But
[01:19:57.389 --> 01:20:05.933]  What happened was... So, there's this new thing I guess restaurants are doing, and it's LGBTQ friendly.
[01:20:06.254 --> 01:20:10.256]  And it's a whole new thing, you get a little patch, you get a little badge, they put it on your Google profile.
[01:20:10.476 --> 01:20:11.576]  LGBTQ friendly.
[01:20:11.596 --> 01:20:12.297]  It's like the new thing.
[01:20:12.417 --> 01:20:12.737]  Oh, okay.
[01:20:14.798 --> 01:20:22.482]  And I went to pick up some carryout last night, and I had a shirt on that had Jesus Christ on it.
[01:20:26.078 --> 01:20:37.695]  And I'm ordering the food, and I see, oh, LGBTQ friendly, and I'm wearing my shirt that has Jesus on it, and I'm thinking, huh, would they deny me service because I'm a Christian?
[01:20:39.958 --> 01:20:42.442]  And it hit, like, the gears meshed right there.
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:59.243]  This whole tolerance, open sexuality, gay, bisexual, transsexual, whatever, dolphin sexual, just the total perversion of normal human behavior and biology, it's actually at its roots an attack on Christianity.
[01:21:00.783 --> 01:21:02.143]  These people know it's all bogus.
[01:21:02.163 --> 01:21:05.564]  They know it's all BS.
[01:21:05.704 --> 01:21:08.644]  99.9% of us won't even care whether you're gay, straight, bi, transsexual.
[01:21:08.665 --> 01:21:10.865]  We'll never even have any interaction with that.
[01:21:11.758 --> 01:21:28.340]  Other than what they're forcing on us, but I realize now that that whole LGBTQ and everything else is all really just an attack on Christianity, folks, because they want to be able to say, because you're a Christian, you're a bigot.
[01:21:29.349 --> 01:21:33.134]  They want to be able to say, because you love Jesus, you're a bigot.
[01:21:33.555 --> 01:21:34.496]  That's their plan.
[01:21:35.257 --> 01:21:36.780]  And so you bring in the tolerance.
[01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:38.542]  Oh, a tolerance of a gay guy.
[01:21:38.702 --> 01:21:39.664]  Oh, a tolerance of this.
[01:21:39.744 --> 01:21:41.086]  Oh, a tolerance of a transsexual.
[01:21:41.126 --> 01:21:42.287]  Oh, a tolerance of a pedophile.
[01:21:43.289 --> 01:21:45.131]  And entrench it, and then corporatize it.
[01:21:46.155 --> 01:21:53.400]  So then you can't even go into a restaurant or a business with a crucifix on your neck, or Jesus on your shirt, because that's considered offensive.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:55.862]  That's the attack on Christianity.
[01:21:55.942 --> 01:21:57.383]  That's what's really at the root of this.
[01:21:57.763 --> 01:22:01.505]  And if you can destroy that Christian ethos in the West, the West dies.
[01:22:04.347 --> 01:22:06.569]  So, it's all an attack on Christianity, folks.
[01:22:08.120 --> 01:22:16.903]  And I predict if they get their way and they get Biden in within a year, wearing anything with Jesus on it or a crucifix will be considered hate speech.
[01:22:17.283 --> 01:22:18.103]  Mark my words.
[01:22:18.504 --> 01:22:19.624]  It'll be considered hate speech.
[01:22:19.804 --> 01:22:20.424]  You will see.
[01:22:20.964 --> 01:22:25.606]  Alex Jones has just gotten boots on the ground in front of the state capitol there in Georgia.
[01:22:25.646 --> 01:22:27.467]  Let's pop in real quick on a live feed.
[01:22:28.007 --> 01:22:29.848]  He's got Enrique Tarrio with him there.
[01:22:29.928 --> 01:22:30.808]  Fuentes is there.
[01:22:32.421 --> 01:22:37.705]  You have a bunch of people, the movement continues to grow, and then ultimately tomorrow it's going to be the big one.
[01:22:38.185 --> 01:22:39.947]  And they're getting the big guy over the fence there.
[01:22:40.127 --> 01:22:40.968]  Not an easy task.
[01:22:42.309 --> 01:22:44.070]  But they got him on over the barrier there.
[01:22:44.130 --> 01:22:51.337]  So it looks like they've began to move on to the actual Capitol grounds where they weren't allowed before.
[01:22:53.098 --> 01:22:57.502]  And so I think Alex is probably about to get on a bullhorn there and make a statement.
[01:23:00.674 --> 01:23:01.854]  Guys, can I get that feedback up?
[01:23:21.539 --> 01:23:33.745]  The British Prime Minister, the Canadian Prime Minister, the German Chancellor, including John Kerry, the former Secretary of State, are all in the news today saying the COVID-19 lockdown
[01:23:35.578 --> 01:23:38.599]  Yeah, and you know, think about this.
[01:24:06.288 --> 01:24:07.489]  There's a couple hundred people out there.
[01:24:07.509 --> 01:24:10.310]  There should be a couple hundred thousand people out there, folks.
[01:24:10.791 --> 01:24:11.351]  You understand?
[01:24:11.371 --> 01:24:16.454]  I mean, I know you understand this, but it's so hard because it's so overwhelming.
[01:24:17.295 --> 01:24:22.798]  They literally faked a worldwide pandemic to launch a great reset.
[01:24:22.838 --> 01:24:28.541]  Now look, everybody understands how corrupt things have become.
[01:24:28.581 --> 01:24:33.004]  The financial markets, the trade bubbles, the debt, the wars, all of it.
[01:24:33.064 --> 01:24:33.845]  It's out of control.
[01:24:34.850 --> 01:24:37.572]  And the only way to really fix it is to basically hit the reset button.
[01:24:37.933 --> 01:24:47.461]  The problem is, the Great Reset isn't hitting the reset button on all these bubbles and markets and nation states and then collapsing them into a one world government.
[01:24:47.981 --> 01:24:49.603]  No, that's the Great Enslavement.
[01:24:50.884 --> 01:24:54.447]  The Great Reset is arresting the criminals!
[01:24:56.897 --> 01:24:58.098]  That's the Great Reset.
[01:24:58.138 --> 01:25:00.059]  The Great Reset is Obama and Biden.
[01:25:00.259 --> 01:25:00.659]  Jail.
[01:25:00.999 --> 01:25:01.659]  The Bushes.
[01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:02.440]  Jail.
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:03.260]  The Clintons.
[01:25:03.621 --> 01:25:04.041]  Jail.
[01:25:04.761 --> 01:25:08.543]  Continue to jail the corrupt politicians in Argentina and Brazil.
[01:25:09.844 --> 01:25:10.364]  Merkel.
[01:25:10.704 --> 01:25:11.865]  Macron.
[01:25:12.005 --> 01:25:16.987]  Anybody who signed on to any global agenda, selling their nation-state down the drain.
[01:25:17.248 --> 01:25:17.648]  Jail.
[01:25:17.948 --> 01:25:19.169]  That's the Great Reset.
[01:25:20.029 --> 01:25:23.511]  But see, they make it all a game where everybody knows it has to be reset.
[01:25:24.414 --> 01:25:35.439]  But they reset it so that the big worldwide criminals who stole everything then are perched on top of us forever and then hide all their criminal behavior and make us all slaves.
[01:25:35.879 --> 01:25:38.440]  You see the Democrats now calling to put us in gulags.
[01:25:38.701 --> 01:25:44.423]  You see the Democrats now putting out their lists saying these are all the people we need to re-educate or kill.
[01:25:45.764 --> 01:25:50.026]  Of course, folks, if you commit crimes on a mass scale
[01:25:51.098 --> 01:25:51.258]  I think?
[01:26:12.592 --> 01:26:17.795]  Robbing us blind and lying and deceiving and dividing us for decades all in jail.
[01:26:18.095 --> 01:26:19.196]  That's the Great Reset.
[01:26:19.516 --> 01:26:20.877]  Arrest the criminal cabal.
[01:26:21.377 --> 01:26:23.018]  Arrest the global criminal cabal.
[01:26:23.499 --> 01:26:24.579]  Arrest the deep state.
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:25.800]  Free humanity.
[01:26:26.100 --> 01:26:26.861]  Free the world.
[01:26:27.241 --> 01:26:30.163]  That is the real Great Reset.
[01:26:31.892 --> 01:26:35.054]  The globalists are trying to censor what you can see and what you can share.
[01:26:35.355 --> 01:26:36.135]  Don't let them win.
[01:26:36.535 --> 01:26:41.319]  Go to our emergency election newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:26:41.579 --> 01:26:45.142]  Sign up for free and get intel they don't want you to have and then share it.
[01:26:45.462 --> 01:26:47.764]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:26:47.964 --> 01:26:50.406]  It's time to override the censors and get the truth out.
[01:26:50.913 --> 01:26:53.015]  We're into the third hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[01:26:53.055 --> 01:26:55.957]  I want to go back to your phone calls.
[01:26:56.957 --> 01:27:00.540]  Again, Alex is in Atlanta, Georgia at the Capitol at a Stop the Steal rally.
[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:09.747]  Tomorrow at noon is the big one at Atlanta, but noon at every state capitol every Saturday until Trump is re-elected is the plan for now.
[01:27:09.827 --> 01:27:12.189]  I'll be out in Austin, Texas tomorrow at noon.
[01:27:13.129 --> 01:27:15.671]  Going back to the phone lines now.
[01:27:16.012 --> 01:27:17.593]  Sam in Indiana.
[01:27:17.633 --> 01:27:20.015]  Sam, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:20.035 --> 01:27:20.355]  Go ahead.
[01:27:21.371 --> 01:27:28.474]  Yeah, first of all, I want to thank you for all your good work that you and Alex do, and the supplements you guys have are unbelievable.
[01:27:29.314 --> 01:27:30.615]  I use them for all the bodybuilding.
[01:27:30.635 --> 01:27:32.175]  It's unbelievable.
[01:27:32.456 --> 01:27:38.918]  My point quickly is, I heard you guys discuss a trucker strike, and I think that has a lot of merit.
[01:27:39.839 --> 01:27:44.761]  Also, something else that we could do is, the idea is called the Great Set Aside.
[01:27:44.781 --> 01:27:50.503]  And there's probably 80 to 100 million people out there that we know for sure that support President Trump.
[01:27:51.292 --> 01:27:59.539]  And the way you can get back without having any violence or anything like that is the ability to set all your tax money aside.
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:01.281]  You still file the forms.
[01:28:01.521 --> 01:28:03.162]  You still stay in compliance with the forms.
[01:28:03.643 --> 01:28:09.868]  But what you do as patriots, you have 1776, and you set the money aside, and you defund the federal government.
[01:28:10.108 --> 01:28:12.951]  You keep the money locally, and that's how you fight back.
[01:28:13.271 --> 01:28:18.896]  Nonviolence, and that combined with the trucker strike, is a way to send a message to the globalists that, number one,
[01:28:19.614 --> 01:28:21.015]  You've weaponized the IRS.
[01:28:21.635 --> 01:28:23.956]  You've weaponized our Justice Department.
[01:28:24.116 --> 01:28:25.457]  You've weaponized our CIA.
[01:28:25.757 --> 01:28:27.158]  You've weaponized our FBI.
[01:28:27.598 --> 01:28:31.640]  You've taken away our ability to have a fair, transparent election.
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:44.006]  So now, what we do is, we simply turn the money off and we defund the federal government and set the money aside until we see structural changes and we can believe in what we're funding.
[01:28:44.750 --> 01:28:45.190]  That simple.
[01:28:45.310 --> 01:28:46.811]  And that with the trucker strike.
[01:28:47.112 --> 01:28:48.172]  I agree with that notion.
[01:28:48.192 --> 01:28:51.675]  The problem is we can't even get people to take off a mask, Sam.
[01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:55.477]  So you think they're going to be able to pull off something like that?
[01:28:56.098 --> 01:28:57.399]  I just don't see it being possible.
[01:28:57.419 --> 01:28:58.599]  They won't even take off the mask.
[01:28:58.639 --> 01:29:03.002]  But the trucker strike, I was told, I think it was like November 29th was the original date I saw.
[01:29:03.062 --> 01:29:09.087]  I don't know if anything's been cemented there, but the truckers are going to plan on shutting down D.C.
[01:29:09.107 --> 01:29:10.928]  if they don't announce Trump the winner soon.
[01:29:12.560 --> 01:29:25.550]  I appreciate everything you do, but now is the time that we have to fight, and if we could get some of the big media, the right-wing media, to band together, and if we all banded together, we could turn the system off and take control of it and defund it.
[01:29:25.870 --> 01:29:26.551]  I do agree.
[01:29:26.571 --> 01:29:28.652]  It's always kind of been a problem.
[01:29:28.672 --> 01:29:31.715]  It's like herding cats, but maybe we're on the way.
[01:29:32.375 --> 01:29:33.456]  Todd in California.
[01:29:33.516 --> 01:29:35.418]  Todd in California, and you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:29:35.438 --> 01:29:35.738]  Go ahead.
[01:29:37.029 --> 01:29:37.749]  Awesome, Owen.
[01:29:37.789 --> 01:29:39.710]  Really great to be able to talk to you, man.
[01:29:39.890 --> 01:29:44.651]  Love listening to you on the show, and I really enjoy all the products that you guys have.
[01:29:44.671 --> 01:29:46.091]  I take a couple of myself.
[01:29:46.131 --> 01:29:47.512]  The X2 iodine's really great.
[01:29:48.752 --> 01:29:57.935]  I just wanted to say, I really think that, for one, I think that Trump might be hiding, hopefully, because he's thinking about enacting the Insurrection Act.
[01:29:59.764 --> 01:30:04.726]  You know, everything they do over there seems to get out to the wrong people within the Democratic Party.
[01:30:04.826 --> 01:30:08.947]  So, I mean, before we know about it, they're going to know about it, and they're going to be plotting.
[01:30:09.267 --> 01:30:15.629]  And if he's really thinking about doing that, they could be thinking about trying to kill him, especially with everything else that's been going on.
[01:30:16.149 --> 01:30:24.692]  Yeah, there's no doubt there's some strategic move here by President Trump to stay in the shadows and pretty much be the unseen president since the election.
[01:30:27.693 --> 01:30:35.557]  He used the words in the beginning, the calm before the storm, and I truly believe that he is... And he also said, hey, you may not be seeing me for a while.
[01:30:37.078 --> 01:30:38.039]  That's exactly right.
[01:30:38.079 --> 01:30:39.960]  That sounds strategic as hell.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:40.660]  It really does.
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:54.528]  The main reason I was also calling is because the media and Facebook and all these other companies, they keep on trying to say that there's a president-elect when Congress issued a letter officially stating on November 13th
[01:30:55.871 --> 01:30:57.532]  That there is no president-elect.
[01:30:57.932 --> 01:30:58.732]  Congress did.
[01:30:59.812 --> 01:31:01.533]  And... Yeah, it's fake news.
[01:31:01.653 --> 01:31:02.713]  It's fake everything.
[01:31:02.733 --> 01:31:03.634]  They fake everything, man.
[01:31:03.674 --> 01:31:04.374]  You know that, Todd.
[01:31:04.414 --> 01:31:07.835]  They fake Russian collusion, fake hate crimes, fake pandemics, fake elections now.
[01:31:08.235 --> 01:31:09.156]  All they know is the fake.
[01:31:10.356 --> 01:31:13.397]  We need to go in with the... The president needs to go in with the military.
[01:31:13.417 --> 01:31:18.659]  And I just want to... I just want to hem everything up by saying that maybe Trump should think about
[01:31:19.415 --> 01:31:23.697]  Investing in InfoWars because they're thinking about purchasing a news show.
[01:31:23.717 --> 01:31:24.357]  Well, you know what?
[01:31:24.517 --> 01:31:26.197]  It's time to invest in InfoWars.
[01:31:26.217 --> 01:31:27.698]  You guys are hard-hitting.
[01:31:27.998 --> 01:31:28.938]  You get the message out.
[01:31:28.958 --> 01:31:31.319]  You inspire other podcasts.
[01:31:31.339 --> 01:31:34.860]  Yeah, I think the way the White House looks at InfoWars is we're just like the wild dog.
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.961]  We're just off the chain, off the leash, and they just let this dog hunt.
[01:31:39.842 --> 01:31:44.964]  Patriots continue to gather in Atlanta, Georgia ahead of the massive
[01:31:46.474 --> 01:31:52.340]  Stop the steel rally that is coming tomorrow noon at the state capitol in Atlanta, Georgia.
[01:31:52.860 --> 01:31:56.684]  This will be happening nationwide at every state capitol tomorrow at noon.
[01:31:56.704 --> 01:32:01.308]  I will be at the state capitol here in Austin, Texas tomorrow at noon.
[01:32:01.828 --> 01:32:03.730]  I hope you can join me then.
[01:32:03.750 --> 01:32:07.894]  Let me just go back out to the phone lines here.
[01:32:07.914 --> 01:32:12.198]  Because if I start getting into this news and start covering it, folks, I mean, you know,
[01:32:14.775 --> 01:32:16.336]  I just don't want to talk like that, okay?
[01:32:16.356 --> 01:32:17.756]  We all know what's going on, alright?
[01:32:18.016 --> 01:32:21.878]  We all know that gut instinct.
[01:32:21.918 --> 01:32:23.779]  We all know how to scratch that itch.
[01:32:25.399 --> 01:32:32.382]  But it's just not really graceful or becoming here on air.
[01:32:32.422 --> 01:32:37.524]  So let me go back to the phone lines and go to Emmerich in FEMA Region 2.
[01:32:37.644 --> 01:32:39.025]  Emmerich, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:32:39.065 --> 01:32:39.385]  Go ahead.
[01:32:40.444 --> 01:32:42.485]  Hi, first, I'd like to plug the X2.
[01:32:43.205 --> 01:32:43.925]  Great product.
[01:32:44.545 --> 01:32:45.525]  Great, great product.
[01:32:46.105 --> 01:32:55.008]  I find it very powerful, but I did it with a five-day cleanse, and it was very, very powerful under that.
[01:32:55.608 --> 01:33:01.189]  It was a five-day, five-day fasting cleanse, and it gave me energy.
[01:33:02.189 --> 01:33:02.810]  Great product.
[01:33:03.790 --> 01:33:04.110]  You know what?
[01:33:04.130 --> 01:33:06.250]  I think I'm gonna hit the X2 right now, actually.
[01:33:07.171 --> 01:33:08.111]  Thank you for reminding me.
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:17.424]  What I wanted to talk about was, you know, hopefully we're going to win this, but, you know, we need contingent plans.
[01:33:18.185 --> 01:33:24.849]  So we need to call on patriots, especially from blue states, to move to the swing states.
[01:33:26.290 --> 01:33:37.036]  And if that doesn't work, at the end, we're going to have to make a coalition of red states that is going to have to separate.
[01:33:37.702 --> 01:33:39.683]  And just let the blue states collapse on their own.
[01:33:40.483 --> 01:34:04.990]  I think we have to come up, if we're going to do something like this, and quite frankly it's all kind of pipe dreamish, but I think the best way to handle that would be just to give the Democrats what they think is the greatest thing ever and just let them have Los Angeles and New York and Chicago and a couple other major cities that they want to run and then basically just secede from them, like there's this thing out there called the Great Idaho Proposal.
[01:34:05.050 --> 01:34:06.290]  I mean, again, it's all pipe dreamish.
[01:34:07.369 --> 01:34:09.230]  I really think it's unreal to even consider any of this.
[01:34:10.091 --> 01:34:12.212]  We have to overturn this corrupt system altogether.
[01:34:12.232 --> 01:34:15.795]  You can try to create new states or new coalitions or all this stuff, it won't matter.
[01:34:15.875 --> 01:34:17.436]  Globalism will squash all of it.
[01:34:20.818 --> 01:34:26.181]  I mean, it's definitely going to be hard, but California alone, you cut the cancer, that's 55 electoral votes.
[01:34:27.984 --> 01:34:30.065]  Hey, I agree, let them burn California to the ground.
[01:34:30.105 --> 01:34:31.946]  They're already doing it, why should we all suffer?
[01:34:32.646 --> 01:34:37.528]  But we've already passed, see that's the problem, we've already passed the opportunity for all of these things to actually work.
[01:34:38.049 --> 01:34:41.510]  It's now, it's globalism, it's liberty or death at this point.
[01:34:41.550 --> 01:34:45.992]  There's no, all these other plans, it's the final level, liberty or death.
[01:34:46.072 --> 01:34:47.053]  Do we have elections?
[01:34:47.293 --> 01:34:48.233]  Do we have a country?
[01:34:48.433 --> 01:34:49.374]  Do we have freedoms?
[01:34:49.674 --> 01:34:50.474]  I mean, that's everything.
[01:34:50.915 --> 01:34:54.836]  We can try to plan out all these other intricate plans and stuff, it's just, it's too late, Emmerich.
[01:34:54.856 --> 01:34:55.917]  I'm sorry to say, it's just,
[01:34:56.497 --> 01:34:57.618]  Again, I'd love to give them.
[01:34:57.658 --> 01:34:58.759]  Give them New York, California.
[01:34:58.799 --> 01:35:00.621]  Let them communist those states into the ground.
[01:35:00.821 --> 01:35:02.082]  So we can show how dumb it is.
[01:35:02.422 --> 01:35:03.523]  So we can show how destructive it is.
[01:35:03.543 --> 01:35:04.064]  It won't matter.
[01:35:04.104 --> 01:35:05.345]  Globalism squashes all of it.
[01:35:05.485 --> 01:35:06.606]  It's not even about communism.
[01:35:06.726 --> 01:35:07.566]  It's about globalism.
[01:35:07.607 --> 01:35:09.268]  It's about the one world government.
[01:35:10.809 --> 01:35:12.010]  It's very difficult.
[01:35:12.050 --> 01:35:13.852]  I mean, I'm in FEMA Region 2 myself.
[01:35:15.934 --> 01:35:18.636]  When you live here, you're bound to know liberal people.
[01:35:19.397 --> 01:35:21.718]  And they won't even listen.
[01:35:22.899 --> 01:35:24.261]  They say, oh, fake news.
[01:35:25.268 --> 01:35:26.808]  It's hard to get through to them.
[01:35:27.028 --> 01:35:29.349]  I try, but... Liberalism is a mental disorder.
[01:35:29.849 --> 01:35:30.169]  It is.
[01:35:30.649 --> 01:35:31.209]  It really is.
[01:35:31.610 --> 01:35:33.470]  And it's just brainwashing, is really what it is.
[01:35:33.490 --> 01:35:36.571]  I appreciate the time.
[01:35:36.631 --> 01:35:37.691]  It's great talking to you.
[01:35:38.011 --> 01:35:38.971]  Thank you for the call, Emrick.
[01:35:39.411 --> 01:35:41.852]  Let's go to Brian in New Hampshire.
[01:35:41.872 --> 01:35:42.772]  Brian, you're on the air.
[01:35:42.812 --> 01:35:43.172]  Go ahead.
[01:35:44.172 --> 01:35:44.733]  Hey, what's up?
[01:35:44.753 --> 01:35:45.613]  What's going on, man?
[01:35:47.013 --> 01:35:50.194]  Just wanted to talk real quick about...
[01:35:51.403 --> 01:36:02.147]  My used-to-be-great-state-of-New-Hampshire-and-our-cuck-of-a-governor, who just put a statewide mask mandate after, you know, a while of not, up to this whole time.
[01:36:03.488 --> 01:36:05.068]  We thought he was a great patriot.
[01:36:05.288 --> 01:36:06.389]  You know, we thought better of him.
[01:36:07.409 --> 01:36:12.131]  And he just came out with a mask mandate, so... Pathetic.
[01:36:12.271 --> 01:36:14.032]  A mask that doesn't even do anything.
[01:36:14.772 --> 01:36:15.572]  But spread disease, actually.
[01:36:15.592 --> 01:36:17.393]  It just says on the boxes it doesn't do anything.
[01:36:17.473 --> 01:36:17.973]  It's a joke, man.
[01:36:18.113 --> 01:36:19.954]  It's so ridiculous that people are this
[01:36:20.413 --> 01:36:21.373]  This dumbed down.
[01:36:21.934 --> 01:36:23.434]  It's sad, you know.
[01:36:23.995 --> 01:36:31.038]  But real quick, I just wanted to say we're out here doing these every Saturday, doing it at the Capitol, Concord.
[01:36:31.798 --> 01:36:39.222]  And on the 28th of November, we will be out there doing an anti-mask rally, and we're going to be pushing to the governor's mansion.
[01:36:39.282 --> 01:36:43.264]  So everyone in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, surrounding states, come join us out there, please.
[01:36:44.574 --> 01:36:48.718]  And, uh, you know, let's just take these last-ditch efforts, turn this thing around.
[01:36:48.758 --> 01:36:50.700]  I mean, because what's next?
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:51.261]  What's next?
[01:36:51.321 --> 01:36:54.204]  I mean, if people are going to wear the mask, they're going to take these inoculations.
[01:36:54.644 --> 01:36:54.844]  Yep.
[01:36:55.084 --> 01:36:55.565]  Bottom line.
[01:36:57.009 --> 01:36:58.890]  And, uh, I'm not for it.
[01:36:59.430 --> 01:37:04.191]  And that's what I'm saying, like, people call in, there's all kinds of great ideas, maybe they'll work to save the republic, maybe they won't.
[01:37:04.731 --> 01:37:14.874]  You really think you can organize 100 million, 200, 300 million Americans to stop paying taxes or do one thing or the other, but you can't even get a city to take off a mask?
[01:37:15.834 --> 01:37:16.994]  You gotta be realistic here.
[01:37:17.294 --> 01:37:18.595]  Brian, thank you so much for the call.
[01:37:19.215 --> 01:37:20.515]  Axel in Texas.
[01:37:21.235 --> 01:37:22.836]  Axel, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:37:22.876 --> 01:37:23.156]  Go ahead.
[01:37:24.352 --> 01:37:25.012]  Hey there, Owen.
[01:37:25.093 --> 01:37:29.055]  I've been a big fan since the Engage Liberty days, so I haven't called in a while.
[01:37:29.836 --> 01:37:35.940]  Wow, that was before I was even at Infowars doing my own thing on my own political stuff.
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:36.460]  That was like 2013-14.
[01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:45.026]  Yeah, I think I called in mostly in 2015 if I remember right, but it was on YouTube, watching a lot back then.
[01:37:45.386 --> 01:37:47.447]  Obviously, you've grown quite a bit since then.
[01:37:47.627 --> 01:37:49.709]  Yeah, they ban me everywhere now, so that's an honor.
[01:37:51.229 --> 01:37:54.872]  Well, that's funny because that's really what I want to talk about in a different way.
[01:37:55.293 --> 01:38:03.880]  I'm a lawyer up in Dallas, and what I wanted to say is that we're watching an immense growth of cancel culture, okay?
[01:38:04.701 --> 01:38:12.187]  We're at a moment right now where President Trump, about a month ago, had some real hard-hitting, really powerful lawyers on his team.
[01:38:13.248 --> 01:38:17.171]  And what we've seen in the last couple weeks is that a lot of them have withdrawn.
[01:38:17.772 --> 01:38:18.853]  Who are those lawyers?
[01:38:21.392 --> 01:38:23.553]  Well, some of the lawyers, I know one was Porter Wright.
[01:38:23.593 --> 01:38:27.134]  They're a big firm that's a nationally respected firm.
[01:38:27.614 --> 01:38:28.714]  They ended up withdrawing.
[01:38:28.734 --> 01:38:32.495]  They got too much flack within the firm, is my understanding.
[01:38:32.695 --> 01:38:38.097]  So basically, Trump tries to get legal teams, and then Democrats flood their phone calls with threatening messages.
[01:38:39.557 --> 01:38:39.957]  You got it.
[01:38:39.977 --> 01:38:47.159]  And you know, look, to understand where they're coming from, I mean, a lot of these folks at these bigger firms... Are you an attorney, Axel?
[01:38:48.180 --> 01:38:48.440]  I am.
[01:38:48.700 --> 01:38:48.960]  Okay.
[01:38:49.520 --> 01:38:49.760]  I am.
[01:38:50.342 --> 01:38:58.826]  And what I want to say is, look, I've seen how these firms work, and I mean, a lot of them are real great people, but they have a very powerful left-leaning worldview.
[01:38:58.846 --> 01:39:02.527]  I mean, it's just if you look at the demographics of lawyers, that's where they're at.
[01:39:03.028 --> 01:39:10.751]  Well, if we have cancel culture that's getting so extreme that not even the president of the United States can pick his own lawyer, then we got problems.
[01:39:11.676 --> 01:39:17.245]  And so what I wanted to say was, I think it's up to everyday people to make your voice heard.
[01:39:17.265 --> 01:39:22.092]  You know, you can't just hide in the shadows with your opinions on your worldview.
[01:39:22.112 --> 01:39:24.376]  I mean, you got to put your mouth where your heart is.
[01:39:24.416 --> 01:39:26.439]  You got to put your butt in seats where your heart is.
[01:39:26.755 --> 01:39:27.175]  We're good to go.
[01:39:52.587 --> 01:40:04.391]  You shouldn't have to deal with a liberal mafia of terrorists coming after you anytime you want to make a move just because they don't like you or they don't like the person you're representing.
[01:40:05.152 --> 01:40:05.752]  It's a cult.
[01:40:06.152 --> 01:40:09.013]  The Democrats and liberals have turned into a cult.
[01:40:09.934 --> 01:40:12.595]  Again, it's the biggest hate group and the biggest terror group in the United States.
[01:40:12.695 --> 01:40:13.855]  Axel, thank you so much for that call.
[01:40:14.315 --> 01:40:18.617]  Real quick before we go to break, let's pop in 60 seconds, Alex Jones bullhorning in Atlanta.
[01:40:18.857 --> 01:40:22.160]  We've only begun to wake up.
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:24.042]  We've only begun to fight!
[01:40:24.122 --> 01:40:25.823]  Get off the sidelines, Kim!
[01:40:37.334 --> 01:40:42.619]  Governor Kemp, announce the special session.
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:45.362]  President Trump got you elected.
[01:40:45.782 --> 01:40:46.683]  He stood with you.
[01:40:47.024 --> 01:40:48.405]  Stand with the people, Kemp.
[01:40:48.785 --> 01:40:50.968]  Be a hero and not a traitor!
[01:40:55.672 --> 01:40:56.132]  USA!
[01:40:56.152 --> 01:40:56.533]  USA!
[01:40:56.973 --> 01:40:57.913]  USA!
[01:40:58.334 --> 01:40:58.794]  USA!
[01:40:58.834 --> 01:41:07.439]  So it appears Alex is currently leading a march from the state capitol building in Atlanta, perhaps to the governor's mansion.
[01:41:07.459 --> 01:41:13.842]  We'll continue to monitor that and give you updates and take your calls when we come back.
[01:41:15.963 --> 01:41:18.805]  So we've got recounts underway in Wisconsin and Georgia.
[01:41:19.185 --> 01:41:24.248]  I just feel that, quite frankly, my opinion is it's a worthless task.
[01:41:25.848 --> 01:41:31.171]  The voting machines must be investigated and shut down.
[01:41:31.751 --> 01:41:42.336]  And quite frankly, we just have to declare any election held on Dominion voting machines or with Smartmatic technology must be nullified and redone.
[01:41:43.137 --> 01:41:44.537]  That's the only way to stop this, folks.
[01:41:45.018 --> 01:41:45.338]  That's it.
[01:41:46.538 --> 01:41:51.661]  Now, we can use our constitutional powers in the states to say, look, we're going to send the delegates for Trump.
[01:41:51.701 --> 01:41:52.581]  He won these states.
[01:41:53.062 --> 01:41:53.802]  They're not going to do that.
[01:41:56.383 --> 01:41:58.946]  So, the recounts are nice.
[01:41:59.106 --> 01:42:00.467]  I don't think it's going to change anything, folks.
[01:42:00.547 --> 01:42:03.170]  I wouldn't get your hopes up on a recount.
[01:42:03.671 --> 01:42:11.078]  Unless they audit the vote or declare any election done on Dominion, Hammer and Scorecard, or Smartmatic to be null and void.
[01:42:11.098 --> 01:42:12.580]  That's the only way.
[01:42:13.501 --> 01:42:13.801]  That's it.
[01:42:14.582 --> 01:42:15.463]  And Sidney Powell knows it.
[01:42:17.039 --> 01:42:26.305]  That's why they're focusing on that and want to get it in front of the Supreme Court with all these sworn affidavits of people who work for the voting companies who said, yeah, we designed it to cheat.
[01:42:26.785 --> 01:42:28.647]  We sold it to buy.
[01:42:28.907 --> 01:42:29.827]  You know, think about this.
[01:42:38.793 --> 01:42:40.935]  How much money is spent
[01:42:42.657 --> 01:42:45.738]  On political campaigns in any given election cycle.
[01:42:45.758 --> 01:42:46.818]  A couple billion?
[01:42:47.358 --> 01:42:48.779]  Give or take two, three, four billion?
[01:42:49.119 --> 01:42:49.399]  Probably?
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:51.920]  Think about it.
[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:52.500]  All that money.
[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:53.580]  All that capital.
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:54.781]  All that energy.
[01:42:55.181 --> 01:42:55.941]  It's all wasted.
[01:42:55.961 --> 01:42:56.521]  It's all fake.
[01:42:57.041 --> 01:42:59.802]  Because the electronic voting machines rig every election.
[01:43:08.705 --> 01:43:09.985]  It's just such a joke, man.
[01:43:10.583 --> 01:43:13.144]  Oh, by the way, China is reopened for business.
[01:43:13.484 --> 01:43:20.247]  They're having international soccer games in 100,000 plus attended venues.
[01:43:22.728 --> 01:43:23.468]  We're a joke, man.
[01:43:24.569 --> 01:43:25.189]  We're just a joke.
[01:43:25.969 --> 01:43:32.032]  And if we let this child molesting creep Joe Biden in the White House, we're done.
[01:43:32.112 --> 01:43:32.752]  Just forget about it.
[01:43:32.772 --> 01:43:33.072]  We're done.
[01:43:33.092 --> 01:43:35.813]  All right, let's go back to the phone lines here.
[01:43:35.893 --> 01:43:38.735]  Don in Illinois, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:43:38.755 --> 01:43:39.415]  Don, go ahead.
[01:43:40.697 --> 01:43:44.120]  Hey, Owen, great fan of you.
[01:43:44.420 --> 01:43:48.423]  A longtime InfoWarrior, first time caller.
[01:43:49.064 --> 01:43:49.824]  Thank you for calling in.
[01:43:51.345 --> 01:44:02.614]  Just wanted to mention that I live in the heart of the resistance, Crook County, where I'm paying probably 10.25% Crook County taxes.
[01:44:03.315 --> 01:44:05.356]  And now my blubbering
[01:44:07.557 --> 01:44:15.133]  Governor wants to probably raise my income taxes and the state sales taxes.
[01:44:16.078 --> 01:44:19.640]  Probably, for the state sales tax, probably another 10%.
[01:44:20.941 --> 01:44:24.664]  Yeah, you're dealing with some corrupt Democrats there in Illinois, not just Pritzker.
[01:44:24.684 --> 01:44:30.068]  What was it, like two or four years ago or something, where they signed some law.
[01:44:30.288 --> 01:44:32.889]  I don't know if they ever actually got it passed or could enforce it legally.
[01:44:33.310 --> 01:44:41.095]  But basically, if you want to move out of Illinois, you basically have to pay property taxes to move, and then even after your move.
[01:44:42.316 --> 01:44:43.657]  That's exactly right, Owen.
[01:44:43.837 --> 01:44:45.398]  And then, on top of that,
[01:44:46.010 --> 01:44:51.991]  They had this thing on the ballot this this year, which was supposedly.
[01:44:52.011 --> 01:44:59.772]  It was framed as a fair tax, but what it was was the unfair tax because.
[01:45:00.713 --> 01:45:05.933]  It was saying after a certain amount of money that you make, they were going to charge you more.
[01:45:06.894 --> 01:45:15.215]  Which was thankfully, thank God it was struck down, but it would have actually caused all
[01:45:15.811 --> 01:45:32.998]  Anyone who was making massive amounts of money, or not even massive, anything above a certain amount, probably around the $300,000 range, which isn't much in the state of Illinois because of all the taxes to begin with, but they would basically leave the state.
[01:45:33.038 --> 01:45:43.683]  So my question to the Democrats is, okay, so all these billionaires or whatever, especially Pritzker, Pritzker's probably the only billionaire in the state to begin with.
[01:45:44.477 --> 01:45:52.823]  And not only that, but he tried to dodge his taxes by taking all the toilets out of his mansion to avoid taxes.
[01:45:53.383 --> 01:45:56.746]  So now he's trying to push that on the middle class.
[01:45:57.546 --> 01:46:03.311]  And if everyone who owns a business moves out of the state, who's stuck with the tax?
[01:46:04.011 --> 01:46:10.396]  It was basically a referendum on the tax code to release the
[01:46:11.483 --> 01:46:17.885]  Well, and this is what Democrats are doing for multiple reasons.
[01:46:18.865 --> 01:46:30.868]  Not just to create a welfare state, but to try to... That's why they write these taxes in New York and Illinois, where if you move, you have to keep paying property taxes in that state, or pay like a moving tax on your property.
[01:46:30.928 --> 01:46:33.029]  It's just totally illegal, totally ridiculous.
[01:46:33.389 --> 01:46:35.049]  That's how they can stop people from leaving.
[01:46:35.829 --> 01:46:37.150]  So, I mean, it's all a scam.
[01:46:38.271 --> 01:46:39.012]  You know, I'm just wondering.
[01:46:39.092 --> 01:46:40.373]  This is an idea that comes to my head.
[01:46:40.413 --> 01:46:40.993]  I'm sorry, Don.
[01:46:41.033 --> 01:46:42.254]  I'm just thinking over here.
[01:46:42.334 --> 01:46:42.635]  You know what?
[01:46:42.655 --> 01:46:44.256]  I have a new proposal.
[01:46:45.337 --> 01:46:52.563]  Since this election is so fraught with discrepancies and anomalies and we just really can't decide on a winner.
[01:46:52.803 --> 01:46:53.624]  You know what?
[01:46:53.764 --> 01:46:54.284]  Let's have this.
[01:46:54.725 --> 01:47:04.052]  Let's just declare whoever can occupy each state capital by the end of November
[01:47:04.966 --> 01:47:06.487]  Let's just have it.
[01:47:06.527 --> 01:47:10.749]  Let's just occupy state capitals and whoever gets to occupy the capitals wins.
[01:47:11.490 --> 01:47:12.830]  It'll be 50 for Trump.
[01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:17.533]  I'm not thoroughly convinced that Illinois went to Biden.
[01:47:17.953 --> 01:47:19.674]  I'm not either because let me tell you something.
[01:47:20.374 --> 01:47:24.116]  Democrats in Illinois are farmers and patriots and gun owners.
[01:47:24.957 --> 01:47:25.777]  They're in my family.
[01:47:25.857 --> 01:47:26.277]  I know them.
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:31.441]  So, they'll vote Democrat, but they're not going to vote against their Second Amendment.
[01:47:31.481 --> 01:47:35.943]  They're not going to vote against the farming industry.
[01:47:35.963 --> 01:47:40.725]  I haven't analyzed the map, but I guarantee them to you, you pull up a map right now.
[01:47:41.527 --> 01:47:43.989]  You'll have two districts near Chicago that went blue.
[01:47:44.329 --> 01:47:45.070]  You'll have East St.
[01:47:45.090 --> 01:47:45.830]  Louis that went blue.
[01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:47.672]  You'll have Springfield that probably went blue.
[01:47:47.972 --> 01:47:49.953]  And then maybe Urbana or Bloomington.
[01:47:50.414 --> 01:47:51.555]  But they're all run by Democrats.
[01:47:51.755 --> 01:47:52.956]  That could be complete fraud.
[01:47:53.196 --> 01:47:56.218]  The whole state of Illinois is probably red except for those five districts.
[01:47:56.238 --> 01:48:05.625]  Before they even announced the election fraud, they automatically gave 22 delegates to Biden.
[01:48:06.646 --> 01:48:07.727]  Before even counting.
[01:48:11.869 --> 01:48:12.490]  It's ridiculous.
[01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:14.031]  It's the same story everywhere.
[01:48:14.592 --> 01:48:16.453]  It's the same story in every state.
[01:48:17.294 --> 01:48:20.757]  It's almost entirely red, except for the Democrat strongholds.
[01:48:22.639 --> 01:48:22.879]  All right.
[01:48:23.260 --> 01:48:24.501]  Well, I love you guys.
[01:48:26.403 --> 01:48:28.685]  God bless America.
[01:48:29.286 --> 01:48:30.467]  We're in big trouble.
[01:48:31.488 --> 01:48:32.088]  Thank you, Don.
[01:48:32.789 --> 01:48:34.491]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're about to take a break here.

[01:48:59.069 --> 01:49:07.535]  I'm not allowed anywhere else, but I have InfoWars, Banned.Video, and all of our other sites, thanks to you shopping at InfoWarsStore.

[01:49:47.193 --> 01:49:48.794]  A little expensive to ship.
[01:49:48.974 --> 01:49:50.495]  We're covering those costs right now.
[01:49:50.555 --> 01:49:53.516]  Part of the Stop the Steal sale at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:49:54.517 --> 01:50:01.381]  Alex Jones and crew are still in Atlanta going around town on the PA.
[01:50:02.061 --> 01:50:16.689]  Owen Schroer here filling in for Alex Jones on the Alex Jones Show in the InfoWars World Headquarters here in Austin, Texas, where I will be tomorrow at noon at the state capitol here of Texas in Austin at noon.
[01:50:18.499 --> 01:50:20.501]  So, join me tomorrow at noon.
[01:50:21.962 --> 01:50:34.433]  And what I think... Well, I've got an idea of what I'm gonna do, but from noon to one, I'm basically gonna be standing out there and receiving questions from any media outlet that wants to come.
[01:50:34.793 --> 01:50:36.234]  Big or small, doesn't matter.
[01:50:36.254 --> 01:50:38.516]  You can have one follower, you can have a hundred million followers.
[01:50:39.777 --> 01:50:42.019]  I'm gonna stand there, I think I'll probably set up a tripod.
[01:50:43.340 --> 01:50:43.661]  Film it.
[01:50:44.802 --> 01:50:46.103]  Stand there with my American flag.
[01:50:47.469 --> 01:50:48.890]  And just take questions from anybody.
[01:50:48.910 --> 01:50:50.571]  So kind of like a live call-in, if you will.
[01:50:51.752 --> 01:50:54.354]  And then I'll film that and upload the whole thing at Bandot Video.
[01:50:54.374 --> 01:50:56.295]  That's tomorrow at the State Capitol in Austin.
[01:50:57.456 --> 01:50:58.417]  At noon.
[01:50:58.537 --> 01:51:00.238]  Going back to the phone lines.
[01:51:01.118 --> 01:51:02.359]  Josh in Texas.
[01:51:02.479 --> 01:51:03.780]  You're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:04.661]  Josh, go ahead.
[01:51:06.122 --> 01:51:08.163]  Bowen, thank you very much for your time, sir.
[01:51:08.583 --> 01:51:10.285]  Just wanted to call.
[01:51:10.765 --> 01:51:12.726]  This call is ten years in the making.
[01:51:13.026 --> 01:51:16.649]  And it's a thank you call to everybody at InfoWars.
[01:51:17.529 --> 01:51:37.954]  Going back many, many, many years, the only way to truly understand everything that's going on at this time is because you guys have broken down over a multiple step and multiple years of time the complex issues, the complexity of our government, the slow takeover of Soros DAs.
[01:51:38.974 --> 01:51:40.355]  There's really only one
[01:51:41.445 --> 01:51:41.986]  We're good
[01:52:00.157 --> 01:52:10.904]  There's no other outlet out there that truly helps people, everyday people, understand the complexity of everyday issues and how difficult it really is to try to save America.
[01:52:11.244 --> 01:52:13.045]  And we are in trouble.
[01:52:13.646 --> 01:52:14.727]  I'm a property manager.
[01:52:14.767 --> 01:52:16.948]  I work for multiple landlords in the Houston area.
[01:52:16.988 --> 01:52:18.769]  I'm a 30-year-old conservative Jew.
[01:52:18.789 --> 01:52:19.770]  I've got three kids.
[01:52:19.790 --> 01:52:24.233]  I'm doing the best that I can to keep my emotions in check because this call is 10 years in the making.
[01:52:27.212 --> 01:52:31.393]  This country is in big time jeopardy, and it's coming from all aspects.
[01:52:31.613 --> 01:52:34.534]  It's affecting people's relationships, people's businesses.
[01:52:34.914 --> 01:52:41.795]  My marriage is in jeopardy simply because of the fact that I won't agree that America is systematically racist.
[01:52:42.175 --> 01:52:49.277]  My wife believes if you cannot agree that this country is a systematic racism problem, that you are racist.
[01:52:50.759 --> 01:52:52.120]  It is ruining marriages.
[01:52:52.500 --> 01:52:53.881]  It is ruining relationships.
[01:52:53.901 --> 01:52:59.004]  I can speak to over 300 local businesses here in the Houston area that have been killed.
[01:52:59.485 --> 01:53:06.750]  Or just think about general human-to-human interaction, Josh, where now half the people are panicked if you're not wearing a mask.
[01:53:07.931 --> 01:53:10.232]  I go to pick up my dinner last night.
[01:53:10.733 --> 01:53:12.014]  It's an outside pickup.
[01:53:12.847 --> 01:53:13.728]  You can't even go in.
[01:53:14.109 --> 01:53:14.830]  So ridiculous.
[01:53:15.631 --> 01:53:16.953]  And so I'm standing outside.
[01:53:17.013 --> 01:53:17.494]  Sun was out.
[01:53:17.534 --> 01:53:18.455]  It was a nice afternoon.
[01:53:18.976 --> 01:53:20.919]  Standing outside, waiting to pick up my dinner.
[01:53:22.381 --> 01:53:23.583]  And some guy comes up.
[01:53:23.603 --> 01:53:24.524]  He's got his mask on.
[01:53:24.564 --> 01:53:25.465]  Everybody wears their mask.
[01:53:25.485 --> 01:53:26.106]  They love their mask.
[01:53:27.133 --> 01:53:28.714]  Some guy comes up, has his mask on.
[01:53:28.774 --> 01:53:33.618]  The guy, uh, the worker gives me my food.
[01:53:34.419 --> 01:53:44.426]  There's some, um, condiment packets or whatever that fall off the ground and they kind of get launched when he hands it to me and they land right at the guy's feet, who is standing there.
[01:53:44.787 --> 01:53:46.948]  And so I just motion over to go pick it up.
[01:53:47.349 --> 01:53:52.152]  He literally hops away like a jackrabbit, like he's afraid because I'm not wearing a mask.
[01:53:52.192 --> 01:53:54.174]  I mean, it's Twilight Zone level hysteria.
[01:53:56.417 --> 01:54:17.878]  And what's really the scary part of this country is that they are trying to take freedom, free out of the word freedom, and where in this country have we gone to where I cannot go to doctors like Dr. Sherry Tenpenny, Dr. Colleen Huber, why am I not allowed as an American citizen to choose what doctor I
[01:54:19.099 --> 01:54:21.061]  But see, that's another thing liberalism has done!
[01:54:49.222 --> 01:54:51.363]  What you're doing is for people like you.
[01:54:51.383 --> 01:54:52.404]  Well, yeah, and think about it too.
[01:54:52.464 --> 01:54:57.126]  Most mainstream news has literally just been turned into a giant ad for Pfizer or something.
[01:54:57.266 --> 01:55:00.207]  Just, you know, the big pharmaceuticals that pay for them to be on air.
[01:55:00.427 --> 01:55:01.728]  Of course they want to push the vaccine.
[01:55:01.768 --> 01:55:02.788]  We're not beholden to that.
[01:55:02.828 --> 01:55:07.370]  But, you know, here's the other thing liberalism has done, and again, it's about peer-to-peer human interaction.
[01:55:08.471 --> 01:55:17.655]  The average doctor or, you know, person that works in the service industry or whatever, probably not a liberal, probably not a brainwashed commie, but see,
[01:55:18.880 --> 01:55:21.783]  Just general activity and general interaction.
[01:55:21.943 --> 01:55:28.049]  You're so afraid now that that person might be a liberal douche, and so you censor your own speech.
[01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:29.871]  Or, you know, you wear the mask.
[01:55:30.072 --> 01:55:41.003]  So now, because of their bullying, intimidation, madness, and intolerance, we're all walking on eggshells, walking on glass, you know, call it political correctness, because
[01:55:41.403 --> 01:55:42.144]  Because we don't know.
[01:55:42.164 --> 01:55:47.768]  There might be some liberal douchebag that's gonna call the police on us or tell us to wear a mask or, you know, tell us to get a vaccine.
[01:55:47.788 --> 01:55:56.574]  So we're all changing our behavior and our approach and what we say and what we do because there might be some liberal douche lurking just getting ready to ruin your day.
[01:55:58.419 --> 01:56:00.200]  Alright, hey Josh, I'm sorry, I gotta bounce.
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:04.523]  President Trump is giving a live press conference right now talking about the rigged drug prices.
[01:56:04.543 --> 01:56:05.724]  We gotta pick this up live.
[01:56:05.784 --> 01:56:07.425]  First we've heard from the President in some time.
[01:56:08.225 --> 01:56:11.507]  Let's pick this up in the middle of this press conference.
[01:56:14.569 --> 01:56:21.434]  Hey, I have to tell you it's a great honor for me to announce that my administration is issuing two groundbreaking rules.
[01:56:22.506 --> 01:56:29.630]  To very dramatically lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people, especially for our cherished seniors.
[01:56:30.710 --> 01:56:42.497]  We're pleased to be joined on this occasion by Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar and Administrator of Center for Medicare Medicaid Services, Seema Verma.
[01:56:42.657 --> 01:56:43.177]  Thank you both.
[01:56:43.277 --> 01:56:43.798]  Thank you both.
[01:56:44.138 --> 01:56:45.539]  And thank you all for being here.
[01:56:45.599 --> 01:56:46.239]  Appreciate it.
[01:56:47.162 --> 01:56:56.169]  The unprecedented reforms we're completing today are the direct result of the historic drug pricing executive orders I signed in July.
[01:56:57.410 --> 01:57:01.793]  Statutorily, we had to go through a very long process, and we got it done.
[01:57:01.853 --> 01:57:03.614]  I was very proud to have gotten this done.
[01:57:03.654 --> 01:57:07.857]  We were pushing it very hard, as we did with the vaccines and other things.
[01:57:09.038 --> 01:57:13.262]  The first action will save American seniors billions of dollars by preventing
[01:57:14.284 --> 01:57:21.168]  Middlemen, famous middlemen, they call them, from ripping off Medicare patients with high prescription prices.
[01:57:22.329 --> 01:57:32.855]  Currently, drug companies provide large discounts on the price of prescription medicines, including nearly $40 billion in rebates to Medicare Part D plans last year alone.
[01:57:33.915 --> 01:57:39.879]  Yet often middlemen stop those discounts from going to the patients, which is what we're interested in, not the middlemen.
[01:57:41.271 --> 01:57:47.696]  Who need it the most, so the patients are going to be now getting the benefit instead of these very wealthy individuals.
[01:57:48.737 --> 01:57:52.981]  Patients pay very high prices and they have for many years, although we brought it down.
[01:57:54.165 --> 01:57:56.507]  First time in 51 years with the costs adding up.
[01:57:56.747 --> 01:57:59.209]  Alright, so the president, I mean, you know, you think about it.
[01:57:59.649 --> 01:58:00.870]  He's bringing the troops home.
[01:58:00.930 --> 01:58:02.371]  He's going after Big Pharma.
[01:58:02.391 --> 01:58:05.714]  I mean, he's doing everything that the left would love to have done ever.
[01:58:06.114 --> 01:58:09.556]  He's doing everything any Democrat president would have loved to put on their resume.
[01:58:09.596 --> 01:58:12.799]  He's doing it and they still hate him for it because they're brainwashed by the media.
[01:58:13.139 --> 01:58:18.423]  You know, I gotta say, this is a little strange because
[01:58:21.004 --> 01:58:23.005]  Folks, I just call it as I see it, as I feel it.
[01:58:23.525 --> 01:58:25.226]  Trump just doesn't feel like the president right now.
[01:58:26.826 --> 01:58:28.687]  It's very, it's a very odd thing.
[01:58:31.268 --> 01:58:39.452]  And I know that he's been, you know, obviously strategically kind of been a disappearing act since the election, but kind of feels weird for him to come out with this.
[01:58:40.796 --> 01:58:45.960]  Which, for all intents and purposes, is just a mundane, trivial press conference talking about the rigged drug prices.
[01:58:46.160 --> 01:58:46.900]  Hey, it's a great victory!
[01:58:46.981 --> 01:58:48.602]  Again, Donald Trump fighting for the American people.
[01:58:48.762 --> 01:58:49.382]  The guy's a hero.
[01:58:49.402 --> 01:58:49.803]  He's a legend.
[01:58:49.823 --> 01:58:52.565]  He's the greatest president of all time, but he's not gonna get any credit for it!
[01:58:54.546 --> 01:58:57.068]  And in the middle of all of this, this is what he comes out with?
[01:58:57.508 --> 01:59:01.551]  To me, this is a weak look, but... I'm not the president.
[01:59:01.932 --> 01:59:02.832]  He's the art of the deal.
[01:59:03.373 --> 01:59:03.613]  Author.
[01:59:05.282 --> 01:59:15.671]  But again, if any other president was doing this, if a Democrat was doing this, taking on Big Pharma, they'd be saluted as a hero, they'd get ten Nobel Peace Prizes, they'd be the Time Person of the Year, which will probably be Fauci, that rat.
[01:59:16.151 --> 01:59:18.193]  But, um, there you go.
[01:59:18.773 --> 01:59:21.456]  Alright, I've got this segment and a short segment coming up.
[01:59:21.736 --> 01:59:24.258]  I want to try to take as many of your phone calls as possible.
[01:59:24.278 --> 01:59:26.220]  The lines are already all lit up still.
[01:59:27.241 --> 01:59:29.483]  And then Dr. Nick Begich hosts the fourth hour.
[01:59:30.822 --> 01:59:33.223]  I am going to take the war room off today.
[01:59:33.943 --> 01:59:35.184]  Harrison Smith will be hosting.
[01:59:35.224 --> 01:59:36.984]  He's got great guests coming up.
[01:59:37.545 --> 01:59:41.046]  Of course, we've got Alex Jones live in Atlanta.
[01:59:41.106 --> 01:59:44.267]  He could pop in at any time as well, so we're monitoring that.
[01:59:45.187 --> 01:59:47.608]  Let's go to James in Indiana.
[01:59:47.668 --> 01:59:49.029]  James, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:49.069 --> 01:59:49.429]  Go ahead.
[01:59:51.610 --> 01:59:54.751]  I have years of experience with our broken government, including the Crub Post Office.
[01:59:55.444 --> 01:59:58.988]  The post office under Joe Biden was ranked number one in whistleblower retaliation.
[01:59:59.528 --> 02:00:09.719]  The post office has exposed millions of users' info, illegally exposed health records, destroyed whistleblower evidence, sold drugs, sold veterans' medications, prostitution, to hiding, altering, and destroying mail.
[02:00:10.459 --> 02:00:15.665]  No one ever questions why mail all over the country is found hidden or the carrier in the news for defecating in someone's yard.
[02:00:16.257 --> 02:00:16.657]  We're good to go.
[02:00:30.794 --> 02:00:31.254]  Set a date for?
[02:00:31.294 --> 02:00:36.358]  A national protest, because a lot of people can't make it to Atlanta, but they have a local post office that's five minutes from their house.
[02:00:59.878 --> 02:01:01.119]  Yeah, that's a difficult one.
[02:01:01.319 --> 02:01:05.481]  I mean, you're not going to convince many people that the post office is their biggest problem.
[02:01:05.942 --> 02:01:07.202]  Quite frankly, myself included.
[02:01:10.564 --> 02:01:16.888]  But when President Trump does his next rally, he needs to have a big prompter up there with Biden admitting to voter fraud.
[02:01:16.988 --> 02:01:17.689]  I've seen the video.
[02:01:17.729 --> 02:01:18.749]  Everybody's seen the video.
[02:01:19.310 --> 02:01:20.190]  No, it's a total joke.
[02:01:20.210 --> 02:01:21.051]  They've been caught red-handed.
[02:01:21.071 --> 02:01:24.413]  But again, the problem is, they're not going to be able to prove it.
[02:01:25.424 --> 02:01:29.986]  The only case that Sidney Powell is going to be able to make, ladies and gentlemen, is the sworn affidavits.
[02:01:30.686 --> 02:01:31.626]  Will the court hear them?
[02:01:32.206 --> 02:01:33.747]  Will they be put on the witness stand?
[02:01:33.807 --> 02:01:35.267]  Will the nation get to see this?
[02:01:35.768 --> 02:01:36.928]  That's all time to tell.
[02:01:37.048 --> 02:01:38.208]  The recount will do nothing.
[02:01:39.149 --> 02:01:40.709]  Fighting the mail-in ballots will do nothing.
[02:01:40.949 --> 02:01:48.892]  You have to null and void any election ever that used Dominion, Hammer and Scorecard, or Smartmatic technology.
[02:01:49.352 --> 02:01:49.872]  Period.
[02:01:50.653 --> 02:01:54.314]  That's how you win this battle for the now and for the later.
[02:01:55.094 --> 02:01:56.275]  James, thank you so much for the call.
[02:01:56.295 --> 02:01:58.757]  Let's go to PJ in Las Vegas.
[02:01:58.817 --> 02:01:59.578]  PJ, go ahead.
[02:02:01.199 --> 02:02:01.499]  Yes.
[02:02:03.241 --> 02:02:05.683]  Warren, man, you are great, man.
[02:02:06.203 --> 02:02:13.029]  And Alex and the crew, I want to wish you guys a happy Thanksgiving and wish you a very Merry Christmas also.
[02:02:13.669 --> 02:02:13.890]  Thank you.
[02:02:13.910 --> 02:02:15.131]  This is what I want to say, man.
[02:02:16.031 --> 02:02:16.472]  You're right.
[02:02:16.852 --> 02:02:19.834]  You and Alex got the devil by the horn, man.
[02:02:20.415 --> 02:02:21.616]  Political and religion.
[02:02:22.537 --> 02:02:24.138]  Satan is losing, man.
[02:02:25.023 --> 02:02:26.524]  And they're emptying out hell, man.
[02:02:26.724 --> 02:02:28.986]  That's the reason why this is going on.
[02:02:29.547 --> 02:02:30.788]  Satan is losing, man.
[02:02:31.448 --> 02:02:36.933]  Jesus said, in the Christ of his mouth and his tongue, we'll destroy Satan.
[02:02:37.613 --> 02:02:39.315]  And we are in the body of Christ, man.
[02:02:39.635 --> 02:02:42.878]  So everything that we are doing is destroying Satan.
[02:02:43.458 --> 02:02:46.440]  And he's emptying out hell, and these people know it.
[02:02:47.321 --> 02:02:51.885]  Not only these people know it, as far as our foreign enemy and globalists,
[02:02:52.549 --> 02:02:56.031]  But Satan himself knows that hell is being ifted out.
[02:02:56.811 --> 02:02:58.992]  Man, this is a powerful thing that you guys got.
[02:03:00.593 --> 02:03:03.814]  Man, y'all got it, man.
[02:03:03.974 --> 02:03:07.776]  Well, you know, I get all up in a tizzy here for obvious reasons.
[02:03:08.356 --> 02:03:10.877]  And quite frankly, for my own mental health, I need some days off here.
[02:03:10.897 --> 02:03:11.458]  So does the crew.
[02:03:11.478 --> 02:03:12.958]  We just can't afford to take it right now.
[02:03:12.998 --> 02:03:13.879]  And we're so committed to this.
[02:03:13.899 --> 02:03:20.502]  But, you know, I feel that, you know, we're all here.
[02:03:22.413 --> 02:03:23.754]  We've all been training for this.
[02:03:23.954 --> 02:03:26.416]  We've all felt that this moment was coming.
[02:03:26.476 --> 02:03:32.660]  So there's a reason we've been prepared for this psychologically, emotionally, intellectually.
[02:03:33.420 --> 02:03:36.442]  There's a reason why we always knew this moment was coming.
[02:03:36.462 --> 02:03:37.783]  There's a reason why we're here.
[02:03:39.144 --> 02:03:42.046]  You know, so it is God's providence, no doubt.
[02:03:43.433 --> 02:03:51.918]  I don't, you know, sometimes I get solace in that, usually not on air, but there's no doubt there's a reason why this is all culminating right now.
[02:03:51.938 --> 02:03:55.800]  I agree with you, sir.
[02:03:56.601 --> 02:04:03.805]  And the main thing, to keep the balance of the thoughts, you got to always remember that the eye is the backbone.
[02:04:04.485 --> 02:04:05.306]  And that's where Alex is.
[02:04:05.346 --> 02:04:07.587]  He's in the eye of the backbone in Georgia.
[02:04:10.387 --> 02:04:15.811]  Yeah, and I think tomorrow's going to be huge in Atlanta, and we'll see what happens nationwide at state capitals.
[02:04:15.851 --> 02:04:17.312]  I expect another big turnout in Austin.
[02:04:17.352 --> 02:04:20.254]  It's been thousands of people the last two Saturdays.
[02:04:20.314 --> 02:04:22.055]  I expect the same thing tomorrow as well.
[02:04:22.095 --> 02:04:23.136]  PJ, thank you so much.
[02:04:23.216 --> 02:04:23.677]  Great call.
[02:04:24.097 --> 02:04:26.559]  Let's go to Tom in New York.
[02:04:26.999 --> 02:04:28.380]  Tom, you're on the Alex Jones Show.
[02:04:28.400 --> 02:04:28.780]  Go ahead.
[02:04:30.021 --> 02:04:32.143]  Yes, Alex.
[02:04:33.364 --> 02:04:34.985]  I just wanted to mention a couple of things.
[02:04:35.025 --> 02:04:37.266]  First off, I took delivery of $135 of info awards.
[02:04:40.433 --> 02:04:42.434]  Uh, essentials and everything yesterday.
[02:04:43.474 --> 02:04:46.135]  And this time the post office didn't smash my box.
[02:04:47.836 --> 02:04:49.057]  No, that's the truth, man.
[02:04:49.097 --> 02:04:52.518]  I've had, I've had more... Man, and people are coming after the post office today.
[02:04:53.158 --> 02:04:56.219]  Well, that guy had a good idea about going to the post office.
[02:04:57.060 --> 02:04:58.240]  At any rate, uh, listen.
[02:04:58.680 --> 02:04:59.921]  Concerning the truckers.
[02:05:01.101 --> 02:05:03.902]  I was there in 1982 and we had the trucker strike.
[02:05:05.303 --> 02:05:09.905]  And it didn't go well because nobody would stay organized.
[02:05:11.570 --> 02:05:19.277]  The way to do a trucker strike, first off, without hurting us, the people, is get the law on your side.
[02:05:20.117 --> 02:05:31.527]  In other words, follow that book to the T, slow down, run 55 miles an hour, everyone stop and have little rallies during a break at a truck stop,
[02:05:32.661 --> 02:05:34.303]  And just slow it down.
[02:05:52.915 --> 02:05:58.216]  Whether it's their day job, their career, their hourly job, you know, whatever, oh my dog, whatever it is.
[02:05:58.536 --> 02:06:02.117]  People are dropping everything to do anything they can do.
[02:06:02.237 --> 02:06:03.358]  Looking for something to do.
[02:06:03.778 --> 02:06:06.038]  Any way for their voice to be heard to try to stop this deal.
[02:06:06.258 --> 02:06:07.659]  That's why you had the million MAGA march.
[02:06:07.679 --> 02:06:09.639]  That's why there's going to be a second one on December 12th.
[02:06:09.659 --> 02:06:11.320]  That's why the truckers are organizing strikes.
[02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:14.000]  That's why at every nation's capital people are rallying and organizing.
[02:06:14.040 --> 02:06:17.341]  So, America is beginning to rise up and roar.
[02:06:17.361 --> 02:06:19.922]  Owen, please.
[02:06:21.261 --> 02:06:28.763]  Um, I was trying for the last, since August, to place an order, and they kept on squelching my card.
[02:06:28.803 --> 02:06:30.903]  I've been on file with you guys for 10 years.
[02:06:31.924 --> 02:06:36.805]  And they kept on, uh, wouldn't allow me to get into my credit card to place the order.
[02:06:37.425 --> 02:06:39.806]  And finally I had to call in, which I did.
[02:06:40.426 --> 02:06:45.827]  But I gotta tell you, man, the suppression and the censorship is the biggest ball that our president dropped.
[02:06:48.171 --> 02:07:00.978]  Well, you can debate what the biggest ball was dropped or the biggest mis-move was, but it's time now for President Trump to have clear vision and strike true against the Deep State and the New World Order.
[02:07:00.998 --> 02:07:02.859]  Otherwise, I'm not sure he's going to get a second chance.
[02:07:02.899 --> 02:07:04.280]  I'm not sure if we're going to get a second chance.
[02:07:04.320 --> 02:07:05.541]  Tom, thank you so much for the call.
[02:07:06.441 --> 02:07:08.182]  David, actually, I'm sorry.
[02:07:08.202 --> 02:07:08.462]  You know what?
[02:07:08.542 --> 02:07:09.403]  Jed in Florida.
[02:07:09.483 --> 02:07:10.683]  Jed has been holding the longest here.
[02:07:10.723 --> 02:07:11.364]  Jed, go ahead.
[02:07:12.584 --> 02:07:13.465]  What's going on, Owen?
[02:07:13.485 --> 02:07:13.925]  How are you, man?
[02:07:14.145 --> 02:07:14.566]  I'm doing good.
[02:07:17.978 --> 02:07:18.878]  I'm sharing a story here.
[02:07:18.918 --> 02:07:22.900]  My mom, she's kind of old school and this is to the, uh, you know, the radio broadcast.
[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:29.424]  He, uh, called it a schnitz show cause he was saying there was no proof of voter fraud with Dominion software.
[02:07:29.444 --> 02:07:33.886]  And that was the Q thing and conspiracy theory, the schnitz show.
[02:07:33.906 --> 02:07:38.068]  I think he comes on like, okay, that's just a local talk show there in Florida.
[02:07:39.529 --> 02:07:41.150]  Um, I think it's nationwide.
[02:07:42.250 --> 02:07:42.690]  I'm not sure.
[02:07:42.710 --> 02:07:43.491]  I listened to you guys.
[02:07:43.551 --> 02:07:44.891]  I've been, I've been putting her on y'all.
[02:07:44.971 --> 02:07:45.992]  And, uh, but anyway,
[02:07:46.673 --> 02:07:52.694]  Well, I'm just unfamiliar with the show or the claim, but I would just say, you know, most people that have made it and are successful in this medium of media,
[02:08:12.878 --> 02:08:17.704]  Have been bought and paid for in some way, shape, or form, and have sold out in some way, shape, or form.
[02:08:17.785 --> 02:08:27.477]  So yes, and I've been saying this at all the rallies and speeches I've been doing, in this level of this battle for the republic, expect to be abandoned, expect to be stabbed in the back.
[02:08:28.522 --> 02:08:42.809]  And so, yeah, you're going to have weak-kneed, cowardly people on the radio and on TV who do not understand the magnitude of this and the real consequences, who are just going along to get along, hoping not to ruffle any feathers so that they can survive on air another four years or what have you.
[02:08:43.469 --> 02:08:44.810]  So that's how I'd measure that, Jed.
[02:08:44.830 --> 02:08:47.912]  Is there any avenue here?
[02:08:48.032 --> 02:08:56.416]  Because I heard you earlier saying Sidney Powell's only case really is with these affidavits, but are they not able to prove that there was an algorithm that these
[02:08:56.963 --> 02:08:59.644]  These softwares are, you know... Maybe they can, maybe they can't.
[02:08:59.824 --> 02:09:01.705]  But see, we have to deal with reality.
[02:09:02.586 --> 02:09:09.969]  And we have to deal with the likely odds of what's going to, you know, be the winning strategy here.
[02:09:09.989 --> 02:09:14.551]  Yeah, that guy looks like a total sellout.
[02:09:15.752 --> 02:09:18.513]  But they just found that show you were talking about.
[02:09:22.795 --> 02:09:24.896]  You just look at all the crimes they've gotten away with,
[02:09:26.482 --> 02:09:29.805]  And so... It's just so hard.
[02:09:29.825 --> 02:09:31.086]  I mean, look at all... I mean, look at this.
[02:09:31.126 --> 02:09:31.726]  Spygate.
[02:09:32.607 --> 02:09:33.768]  Fake Russian collusion.
[02:09:33.808 --> 02:09:35.029]  The fake PP dossier.
[02:09:35.149 --> 02:09:39.012]  I mean... They've gotten away with so much.
[02:09:39.032 --> 02:09:41.014]  I mean, they've been caught red-handed doing so much.
[02:09:41.514 --> 02:09:47.919]  It's just like... I mean, so how do you defeat this system that is so big, so corrupt, so widespread, owns everything?
[02:09:48.520 --> 02:09:49.240]  How do you beat it?
[02:09:49.300 --> 02:09:50.421]  What is the skeleton key?
[02:09:50.461 --> 02:09:54.785]  What is... You know, what... You wanna hear a real mind-twister?
[02:09:55.005 --> 02:09:55.565]  Cesspool.
[02:09:56.516 --> 02:09:56.736]  Oh, man.
[02:09:56.776 --> 02:09:57.077]  Praise God.
[02:10:17.951 --> 02:10:19.693]  Let me say, I just missed you in Tulsa.
[02:10:20.394 --> 02:10:24.179]  My plug is going to be Vazzo X2 and Ultra 12.
[02:10:24.219 --> 02:10:26.983]  That's that intestinal fortitude.
[02:10:27.023 --> 02:10:27.724]  That's good stuff.
[02:10:28.725 --> 02:10:30.067]  Really taking care of me on there.
[02:10:31.048 --> 02:10:33.532]  And the reason I called was this East and West Coast agenda.
[02:10:34.130 --> 02:10:36.972]  You know, that's a facet of the NWO.
[02:10:37.312 --> 02:10:43.035]  And, you know, the disparity that's being caused politically is going to end up in this material loss.
[02:10:43.115 --> 02:10:50.960]  And I don't think it's a good idea to even entertain conversation about seceding infrastructure and lands, especially on our coasts.
[02:10:51.601 --> 02:10:53.562]  It's just another weakening aspect of this war.
[02:10:55.731 --> 02:10:56.271]  No, I agree.
[02:10:56.311 --> 02:11:00.672]  That's why when the caller brought it up earlier, I said it's kind of pipe dreamish and unrealistic.
[02:11:00.692 --> 02:11:05.874]  I mean, you could fathom it, you could talk about it, you could propose it, but is it really legitimate?
[02:11:05.954 --> 02:11:07.174]  Is it really something that could ever happen?
[02:11:07.194 --> 02:11:07.554]  Probably not.
[02:11:09.674 --> 02:11:10.355]  We've got to stand.
[02:11:10.395 --> 02:11:11.655]  We've got to enforce our laws.
[02:11:11.715 --> 02:11:14.236]  We've got to enforce our principled laws.
[02:11:14.916 --> 02:11:16.456]  We've got to go after the people that don't.
[02:11:16.476 --> 02:11:19.937]  No doubt about that.
[02:11:22.985 --> 02:11:29.947]  Man, I'd just like to say, you know, we need to further consider, you know, the long term here.
[02:11:30.408 --> 02:11:33.569]  There's pretty much, the social contract's broken.
[02:11:33.589 --> 02:11:35.289]  The civil contract's broken.
[02:11:36.209 --> 02:11:40.471]  The zero, you know, the violations in our elections have already occurred.
[02:11:41.906 --> 02:11:46.027]  There's basically zero confidence in government at this point.
[02:11:46.047 --> 02:11:46.487]  What's up everyone?
[02:12:10.339 --> 02:12:10.719]  What's up, John?
[02:12:10.739 --> 02:12:11.060]  Hello?
[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:12.361]  What's up, man?
[02:12:14.062 --> 02:12:14.502]  Hey, look.
[02:12:16.224 --> 02:12:20.207]  What we got to do is go straight to the media outlet.
[02:12:21.228 --> 02:12:21.688]  Millions.
[02:12:21.808 --> 02:12:22.369]  Thousands.
[02:12:22.989 --> 02:12:24.190]  Every one of them.
[02:12:24.230 --> 02:12:24.550]  CNN.
[02:12:24.951 --> 02:12:25.671]  CBS.
[02:12:26.172 --> 02:12:26.872]  NBC.
[02:12:27.273 --> 02:12:27.853]  Whoever.
[02:12:29.194 --> 02:12:31.616]  Until we can get our information out.
[02:12:33.358 --> 02:12:34.118]  We got to do that.
[02:12:34.318 --> 02:12:35.619]  We got to go door to door.
[02:12:35.679 --> 02:12:36.200]  Houses.
[02:12:37.398 --> 02:12:38.719]  And wake everybody up.
[02:12:39.160 --> 02:12:41.101]  Yeah, everybody must be the Paul Revere.
[02:12:42.302 --> 02:12:43.964]  Hey, listen.
[02:12:44.184 --> 02:12:46.265]  By any means necessary.
[02:12:48.107 --> 02:12:48.587]  You hear me?
[02:12:48.828 --> 02:12:51.430]  They have tried this two or three times, right?
[02:12:52.370 --> 02:12:52.931]  In history.
[02:12:53.431 --> 02:12:53.792]  Correct?
[02:12:54.732 --> 02:12:55.173]  Something.
[02:12:55.913 --> 02:12:57.655]  Communist, socialist, something, right?
[02:12:59.568 --> 02:13:01.069]  Well, here's what they try to do, though, John.
[02:13:01.089 --> 02:13:15.216]  They try to say, and this is, again, just more of the mind games of the lying, deceptive, liberal left, you know, they come after your children, they come after your money, they come after your property, they come after everything, and then if you try to rise up, they say, how dare you?
[02:13:15.236 --> 02:13:16.017]  That's hate speech!
[02:13:16.057 --> 02:13:16.857]  That's intolerant!
[02:13:16.877 --> 02:13:17.618]  You're violent!
[02:13:17.978 --> 02:13:19.539]  No, you're the slave drivers!
[02:13:19.779 --> 02:13:21.460]  You broke the non-aggression principle!
[02:13:21.720 --> 02:13:23.201]  You broke the social contract!
[02:13:23.401 --> 02:13:24.061]  That was you!
[02:13:24.301 --> 02:13:25.502]  You will reap what you sow!
[02:13:26.553 --> 02:13:30.334]  One thing I got to say is, I'm a true American patriot.
[02:13:31.114 --> 02:13:37.795]  And if they come to my house, the Second Amendment will be used.
[02:13:37.955 --> 02:13:38.975]  And I ain't thinking about it.
[02:13:38.996 --> 02:13:40.196]  I'm not threatening nobody.
[02:13:41.216 --> 02:13:42.296]  I'm not threatening nobody.
[02:13:42.556 --> 02:13:43.236]  That's the promise.
[02:13:43.736 --> 02:13:45.017]  I'm not threatening nobody, though.
[02:13:46.077 --> 02:13:46.577]  I hear you.
[02:13:46.597 --> 02:13:47.937]  John, what part of New York are you from?
[02:13:48.837 --> 02:13:49.358]  Buffalo.
[02:13:50.098 --> 02:13:50.338]  Yeah.
[02:13:50.978 --> 02:13:56.219]  The western New Yorkers are pretty fed up right now with Cuomo and the like.
[02:13:57.580 --> 02:13:58.841]  Hey, you ain't listening.
[02:13:59.481 --> 02:14:05.084]  By any means necessary, it's time to take back America.
[02:14:06.685 --> 02:14:07.206]  It's time.
[02:14:08.767 --> 02:14:09.307]  It's time.
[02:14:10.248 --> 02:14:10.748]  No, it is.
[02:14:11.008 --> 02:14:12.369]  We got like three months, man.
[02:14:12.569 --> 02:14:13.069]  I'm tired.
[02:14:13.389 --> 02:14:14.610]  I'm not scared, man.
[02:14:15.371 --> 02:14:15.711]  You hear me?
[02:14:16.071 --> 02:14:17.092]  That's one thing about me.
[02:14:17.132 --> 02:14:17.772]  I'm not scared.
[02:14:17.792 --> 02:14:18.652]  I'm a true soldier.
[02:14:19.893 --> 02:14:21.914]  Never was in the military, but I'm a soldier.
[02:14:22.715 --> 02:14:26.077]  Because I've been training for stuff like this since I was a kid.
[02:14:26.670 --> 02:14:31.894]  And ladies and gentlemen, there are 10 million, 20 million, 30 million Johns out there.
[02:14:31.914 --> 02:14:34.395]  Oh, you think you can conquer John?
[02:14:35.576 --> 02:14:38.018]  You think the New World Order is going to conquer John?
[02:14:38.198 --> 02:14:38.418]  No.
[02:14:39.319 --> 02:14:40.359]  Liberty or death?
[02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:41.600]  Thank you, John.
[02:14:41.880 --> 02:14:42.881]  Death to tyrants!
[02:14:43.301 --> 02:14:44.182]  Nick Begich takes over.
[02:14:45.370 --> 02:14:48.531]  The globalists are trying to censor what you can see and what you can share.
[02:14:48.831 --> 02:14:49.631]  Don't let them win.
[02:14:50.011 --> 02:14:54.813]  Go to our emergency election newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:14:55.073 --> 02:14:58.614]  Sign up for free and get intel they don't want you to have and then share it.
[02:14:58.954 --> 02:15:01.254]  InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[02:15:01.454 --> 02:15:03.895]  It's time to override the censors and get the truth out.
[02:15:04.535 --> 02:15:05.636]  And welcome back.
[02:15:05.696 --> 02:15:11.899]  You know, I'm here in Anchorage, Alaska again this morning, my morning still and afternoon in most parts of the country.
[02:15:11.959 --> 02:15:18.502]  And John is working with me in the control room and I appreciate the whole team down there in Austin.
[02:15:19.163 --> 02:15:23.285]  Owen filling in for Alex today and me catching the last hour on Friday.
[02:15:23.845 --> 02:15:29.048]  And I was thinking as I was listening to some of the callers and thinking about what was being said and
[02:15:30.489 --> 02:15:40.015]  And I had gotten some attention on some email traffic this week, and just so listeners know, I just can't respond to everything.
[02:15:40.076 --> 02:15:41.096]  It's just impossible.
[02:15:41.457 --> 02:15:50.203]  And I volunteer time and do the best I can, but small team here in Alaska, you're looking at the Alaska branch of the InfoWars.
[02:15:51.203 --> 02:15:57.608]  But I want to say this about that, is I listen, I try to integrate then what I learn from people who do correspond.
[02:15:57.708 --> 02:15:57.828]  Yes.
[02:16:18.431 --> 02:16:19.872]  This is what I know about that.
[02:16:19.952 --> 02:16:24.655]  First of all, millimeter waves, microwave technology used for this purpose.
[02:16:25.576 --> 02:16:26.556]  No question about it.
[02:16:26.636 --> 02:16:28.298]  But how do they use it?
[02:16:28.378 --> 02:16:29.018]  What does it do?
[02:16:29.078 --> 02:16:32.660]  It'll create, for instance, a heating sensation on the skin.
[02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:33.421]  You can create
[02:16:36.923 --> 02:16:41.164]  135, 140 degrees, I mean, where it's really, really painful.
[02:16:41.964 --> 02:16:45.945]  And it's again for pushing you back or driving people away.
[02:16:46.426 --> 02:16:56.749]  And because the border agreement dealt with just one aspect, it dealt with the aspect of not shooting normal conventional weapons, you know, bullets and bombs.
[02:16:57.069 --> 02:17:00.170]  That's why EM, electromagnetic weapons, were developed.
[02:17:00.954 --> 02:17:07.641]  Uh, over 25, 30 years ago and have been continued, uh, in terms of the development and strategy over the years.
[02:17:07.681 --> 02:17:11.645]  And there's a photo up for those that have the video feed and you also see the U.S.
[02:17:11.705 --> 02:17:13.487]  version of the same device.
[02:17:13.587 --> 02:17:16.590]  Now, these devices were well spoken about.
[02:17:16.610 --> 02:17:19.433]  The Secretary of Defense came out, spoke about them.
[02:17:19.873 --> 02:17:23.176]  Mainly for crowd control, riot control purposes, and dual use.
[02:17:23.196 --> 02:17:35.645]  You'll see these on our streets of America because they're a good way to control crowds without killing anyone, without the same visual images that you get when smoke, tear gas, and clubs, and all that come out.
[02:17:36.085 --> 02:17:42.026]  So they'll use what are called non-lethal technologies, technologies that don't necessarily kill you.
[02:17:42.726 --> 02:17:52.428]  The problem is with these microwave weapons, they can interfere with certain electronic devices, you know, like hard pacemakers, other appliances you might have in your body that keep everything rolling.
[02:17:52.748 --> 02:18:02.590]  So you might want to think about this as they're deployed around the world and around the country, because I reported on this in the 1980s, was when the first conversations were coming.
[02:18:02.610 --> 02:18:05.431]  And in the early 90s, we began to break the story because
[02:18:06.151 --> 02:18:11.275]  What the Department of Defense and Department of Justice were talking about is priority funding for dual use.
[02:18:11.695 --> 02:18:14.978]  This is how far back all of this goes.
[02:18:14.998 --> 02:18:31.990]  The dual use theory was that we could take these types of weapons and I testified in the European Parliament, I testified in major international groups about slowing this down because of the invasiveness of the technologies coupled with the invasiveness of the surveillance technology.
[02:18:32.490 --> 02:18:36.172]  So these things are real, they're just being talked about more in the mainstream now.
[02:18:36.532 --> 02:18:50.460]  Now what happened as a result of that testimony that I gave is the most important security and disarmament recommendations coming out of the European Parliament by consensus, by the biggest consensus, were our sections.
[02:18:51.093 --> 02:18:57.983]  In that, which dealt with part, which I'm not talking about today, non-lethal weapons, which were right on point here, okay?
[02:18:58.384 --> 02:19:06.156]  So when they passed that, this section on non-lethal weapons, things that would kill you without making holes in you in the same conventional way,
[02:19:06.756 --> 02:19:15.123]  This, this was so, we presented so much evidence, three feet of unclassified documents to prove our point.
[02:19:15.183 --> 02:19:17.545]  Scientific literature, the studies, everything.
[02:19:17.865 --> 02:19:21.568]  This is going back two decades, more than two decades, okay?
[02:19:21.988 --> 02:19:27.973]  This is how old all this news is, that the mainstream's finally figuring out and leaking in.
[02:19:29.284 --> 02:19:30.624]  Give me a break.
[02:19:30.884 --> 02:19:35.026]  The point of InfoWars has always been we're the tip of the spear.
[02:19:35.066 --> 02:19:36.426]  We've been in this longest.
[02:19:36.526 --> 02:19:45.648]  I've been volunteering time as a voice on InfoWars since Alex started because he started just about a year, year and a half after I did in this work.
[02:19:46.369 --> 02:19:47.649]  And he built this network.
[02:19:48.109 --> 02:19:55.651]  And a couple of years ago, three years ago, when things were really horrible, you know, for Alex going on a lot of stuff and he needed help.
[02:19:56.258 --> 02:20:06.553]  And I flew down to Austin and actually spent a week there and met Alex face to face for the first time after all those years of working together, just the nature of our lives.
[02:20:07.514 --> 02:20:13.242]  But this was time for an intermission and lift up my brother down there in Austin.
[02:20:14.102 --> 02:20:18.827]  And I'm asking every one of you listening right now to do this in lots of different ways that you can.
[02:20:18.887 --> 02:20:21.329]  I know a lot of people economically can't help in that way.
[02:20:21.689 --> 02:20:22.030]  So don't.
[02:20:22.490 --> 02:20:22.791]  Pray.
[02:20:23.111 --> 02:20:23.631]  You can do that.
[02:20:23.792 --> 02:20:24.292]  It's free.
[02:20:24.312 --> 02:20:25.373]  It doesn't cost you anything.
[02:20:25.413 --> 02:20:27.235]  And everybody here, I know.
[02:20:27.255 --> 02:20:28.276]  I know.
[02:20:28.876 --> 02:20:29.637]  And I've been there.
[02:20:29.677 --> 02:20:30.298]  I've seen it.
[02:20:30.558 --> 02:20:33.000]  I've been a couple of different times for a week each time.
[02:20:33.441 --> 02:20:36.544]  And you are supporting an incredible team.
[02:20:37.293 --> 02:20:40.315]  And those guys need a payroll to keep going.
[02:20:41.376 --> 02:20:44.197]  I'm blessed so I can volunteer my time here.
[02:20:44.237 --> 02:20:45.118]  And that's what I do.
[02:20:45.338 --> 02:20:47.660]  When you hear me on radio around the world, that's what I'm doing.
[02:20:47.720 --> 02:20:50.882]  I'm volunteering my time because this is my info war.
[02:20:50.922 --> 02:20:58.026]  And I get to work with up to 200 producers worldwide in television and radio and have been for 25 years.
[02:20:58.046 --> 02:21:03.890]  Because this message, the message that we're all talking about today, needs to be everywhere.
[02:21:04.841 --> 02:21:18.607]  It needs to be through every venue, reaching every constituency, from the far left to the far right and everybody in between, because we have a message, a message of liberty, of sovereignty, of freedom.
[02:21:19.228 --> 02:21:32.914]  And what free speech gives us in the opportunity to engage one another, because the fundamental aspect of every issue that we talk about boils down to one thing, being able to be the voice.
[02:21:34.224 --> 02:21:35.784]  To be able to speak freely.
[02:21:36.565 --> 02:21:44.267]  To be able to take what we are as created human beings in the image and likeness of God and press it through our voices and be heard.
[02:21:44.767 --> 02:21:51.389]  And people can discern what we say and separate what we say and choose on their own because that's their right.
[02:21:51.789 --> 02:21:53.109]  That is their birthright too.
[02:21:53.970 --> 02:21:58.191]  But the Infowar is not about shutting the opposition down.
[02:21:58.731 --> 02:22:00.131]  It's about a better idea.
[02:22:00.151 --> 02:22:02.292]  A better set of values.
[02:22:02.896 --> 02:22:15.446]  A better base set of concepts that people can believe in because here's what every human being does unless they've so shut it all down they no longer have what we call consciousness connected to them in the same way.
[02:22:15.786 --> 02:22:24.533]  They've closed the voice down that's heard all the time as we direct our traffic through the brain and they don't listen.
[02:22:25.394 --> 02:22:26.575]  There's not very many of them.
[02:22:27.716 --> 02:22:31.859]  The rest, truth rings in the soul of every living soul.
[02:22:33.058 --> 02:22:39.660]  Every soul seeking to awaken to who they are and what they are and what we are and what we can do and how we can do it.
[02:22:40.881 --> 02:22:48.363]  And all these threats against us generate fear, anxiety, and the very things that shut down the power that we are.
[02:22:49.904 --> 02:22:51.324]  The love that flows through us.
[02:22:51.965 --> 02:22:55.306]  Now I want to jump into another issue that got touched on, the Chinese.
[02:22:56.064 --> 02:23:00.629]  You know, concepts of what's going on and how does this roll out and what does this really mean?
[02:23:00.649 --> 02:23:04.374]  Because now they're introducing these non-lethal weapons to the battlefield.
[02:23:04.930 --> 02:23:09.152]  In a way that circumvents current treaties and laws and regulations.
[02:23:09.553 --> 02:23:13.235]  This is the point I've been making for 25 years.
[02:23:13.635 --> 02:23:29.344]  It's not just the Chinese, it's ICOMS, it's all of their collaborators in the West, for a little bit of money, has traded off technology to the point where we don't have the control and command that we used to have.
[02:23:30.424 --> 02:23:31.165]  They do too.
[02:23:32.045 --> 02:23:33.466]  And they have a lot more people.
[02:23:34.102 --> 02:23:39.263]  And they produce their technology for a fraction of the money that we do historically.
[02:23:39.323 --> 02:23:44.765]  Of course, AI is going to change that and flatten that playing field out because labor won't be the big factor.
[02:23:45.045 --> 02:23:50.627]  And we should be concerned about that because that is the direction of the 21st century and how we shape that.
[02:23:51.007 --> 02:23:51.867]  How do we do that?
[02:23:52.967 --> 02:23:58.689]  How do we transfer all the things that you and I do from flipping burgers to driving trucks?
[02:23:59.509 --> 02:23:59.729]  Right.
[02:24:00.814 --> 02:24:02.535]  Underground miners, all of it.
[02:24:02.875 --> 02:24:10.157]  It's all going AI, robotics, because it's cheaper, they don't file workers comp claims, and they don't have 401ks.
[02:24:11.577 --> 02:24:19.280]  We are all expendable in the 21st century if we allow a globalist takeover of everything.
[02:24:19.760 --> 02:24:26.322]  It's not just our flesh at stake, it's our living souls and how we are playing it out in the planet today.
[02:24:26.362 --> 02:24:30.563]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, you're listening to The Info Wars, and we'll be right back after these messages.
[02:24:31.892 --> 02:24:33.514]  And welcome back.
[02:24:33.654 --> 02:24:40.002]  You know, I always forget to run my own commercial and the guys always put up the image and I space it out.
[02:24:40.083 --> 02:24:41.464]  It's earthpulse.com.
[02:24:41.504 --> 02:24:42.586]  Check out my website.
[02:24:42.626 --> 02:24:43.707]  There's lots of things there.
[02:24:44.108 --> 02:24:48.693]  There's also a link to all the previous programs I've done on InfoWars.
[02:24:48.713 --> 02:24:50.516]  It takes you right into band.video.
[02:24:51.036 --> 02:25:02.864]  And then they're all chronological so if you click on that button it's under special events right in the middle of the screen at earthpulse.com and you can look at what I've done and subjects that we've covered and there's a lot of material there.
[02:25:03.985 --> 02:25:10.209]  Jumping into what I left off with was the issue of free speech and why it's so important right now.
[02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:15.253]  Of all the issues it is the issue because nothing else can happen unless we can still have a conversation.
[02:25:15.862 --> 02:25:23.683]  And I've even read reports now, people calling for the banning of talk radio altogether to keep our voices from being heard.
[02:25:24.744 --> 02:25:27.204]  This is insanity in this republic.
[02:25:27.584 --> 02:25:31.505]  That is total craziness in the modern world.
[02:25:32.245 --> 02:25:41.567]  You know, and anyone that's trying to sell you this is also interested in selling you something that just doesn't exist.
[02:25:43.024 --> 02:25:46.766]  This is a sales pitch for the wrong game plan, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:25:47.246 --> 02:25:49.547]  Our speech is fundamental to who we are.
[02:25:49.927 --> 02:25:55.330]  And the idea of offending people with words, you remember when we were little kids, maybe they don't even say this anymore.
[02:25:55.730 --> 02:25:59.712]  Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words would never hurt me.
[02:26:00.092 --> 02:26:01.632]  Get real, folks.
[02:26:01.893 --> 02:26:07.195]  I mean, are we that much of a weak, uh, wimp society?
[02:26:07.375 --> 02:26:08.295]  I don't think so.
[02:26:08.315 --> 02:26:08.536]  I know.
[02:26:08.556 --> 02:26:08.876]  I know that.
[02:26:09.276 --> 02:26:09.876]  I know that.
[02:26:10.076 --> 02:26:10.556]  I know that.
[02:26:12.970 --> 02:26:20.326]  Anyone who believes that we should lay down and just take it and shut up and behave?
[02:26:20.346 --> 02:26:20.386]  No!
[02:26:21.288 --> 02:26:22.510]  That is not who we are.
[02:26:22.610 --> 02:26:23.312]  Be polite.
[02:26:23.432 --> 02:26:24.174]  Be respectful.
[02:26:24.969 --> 02:26:27.831]  But I wouldn't say behave in the sense of conforming.
[02:26:27.891 --> 02:26:29.152]  I'd say do the opposite.
[02:26:29.512 --> 02:26:31.393]  Be a respectful nonconformist.
[02:26:31.834 --> 02:26:39.639]  And you know, when I drop kids off at school, I say, hey, you're going to the propaganda palace today.
[02:26:39.999 --> 02:26:43.961]  Make sure you ask respectful questions when you don't believe what you're being told.
[02:26:44.442 --> 02:26:47.604]  Because even children know in their heart
[02:26:48.197 --> 02:26:50.740]  When the message isn't ringing true.
[02:26:51.201 --> 02:26:57.889]  And they need to have confidence in that voice and not start shutting it down at 7 and 8 and 9.
[02:26:58.310 --> 02:27:00.692]  Because here's what happens when they do.
[02:27:01.814 --> 02:27:04.137]  Then it shuts down permanently.
[02:27:04.733 --> 02:27:05.874]  Let me say that again.
[02:27:06.394 --> 02:27:13.499]  If you quit listening to what some call the little voice in the head, you know, your consciousness, maybe God talking to you.
[02:27:13.859 --> 02:27:19.223]  If you quit listening, eventually you stop hearing because the voice isn't there anymore.
[02:27:19.803 --> 02:27:23.005]  You filter it out like background noise in a crowded room.
[02:27:23.546 --> 02:27:24.186]  Don't do that.
[02:27:25.707 --> 02:27:27.268]  Don't do that.
[02:27:27.789 --> 02:27:29.530]  Stay firm on your truth.
[02:27:30.626 --> 02:27:36.577]  If you're going to shake it, change it, whether it's something I say or any of us say, check it out!
[02:27:37.358 --> 02:27:42.988]  Don't change your trajectory on your path through life because I say something unless you can confirm it's true.
[02:27:44.133 --> 02:27:44.593]  That's it.
[02:27:44.713 --> 02:27:45.594]  Two witnesses.
[02:27:46.114 --> 02:27:47.015]  Don't make the change.
[02:27:47.095 --> 02:27:48.016]  Confirm it's true.
[02:27:48.096 --> 02:27:48.816]  Find the evidence.
[02:27:48.836 --> 02:27:50.177]  Now, that's what I want to get to.
[02:27:50.197 --> 02:27:56.441]  Because in the context of delivering free speech, you've got to dig out information, and that's getting harder and harder.
[02:27:56.781 --> 02:28:05.027]  And I know, guys I talk to all the time, because the cartoonish nature of the mainstream gets getting more and more ridiculous.
[02:28:05.587 --> 02:28:12.872]  On the last time I could fly an international flight, I went to the back, you know, to use the bathroom because I still fly economy.
[02:28:12.892 --> 02:28:14.053]  And when I was walking back,
[02:28:15.214 --> 02:28:19.116]  I see all these screens up, you know, and people watching their TV.
[02:28:19.156 --> 02:28:22.237]  And you know, most of them are watching cartoons, for God's sake.
[02:28:22.377 --> 02:28:22.918]  Adults!
[02:28:24.138 --> 02:28:27.860]  This is the programming we're dumping in, is the cartoons?
[02:28:28.721 --> 02:28:29.321]  I guess so.
[02:28:29.801 --> 02:28:32.022]  Which means, it's bad news and good news.
[02:28:32.082 --> 02:28:32.823]  Here's the good news.
[02:28:32.903 --> 02:28:34.424]  Most people are watching cartoons.
[02:28:34.444 --> 02:28:37.625]  That makes the few of us that aren't a lot more effective in what we do.
[02:28:37.685 --> 02:28:39.006]  And that includes every one of you.
[02:28:39.026 --> 02:28:40.407]  Because you're paying attention.
[02:28:40.447 --> 02:28:41.467]  You're getting information.
[02:28:42.288 --> 02:28:43.028]  Dig it out.
[02:28:43.641 --> 02:28:57.369]  Confirm it also, no matter who's delivering it, confirm it, even if it's a trusted source, because if it's about your life, take control of your life and quit getting pushed around by anybody, because this is the problem with the globalists.
[02:28:57.429 --> 02:29:10.557]  I think they just keep pushing and pushing and just nudging and nudging, and we just keep falling into this tighter and tighter bubble until they just squeeze a living soul out of us, and that's the objective, and we can't let it happen.
[02:29:11.485 --> 02:29:16.631]  Let me talk, I'm going to shift gears a bit, and I want to get into something that got mentioned again, the Chinese.
[02:29:16.651 --> 02:29:19.974]  Do you know Chinese have a problem now in China?
[02:29:19.994 --> 02:29:22.136]  It's called Chinese Isis.
[02:29:22.617 --> 02:29:26.921]  They got an Islamic State rising in China.
[02:29:26.961 --> 02:29:31.967]  Now the first time I heard about this was in a lecture at the Alaska Pacific University
[02:29:32.988 --> 02:29:35.069]  Here in Alaska, obviously, in Anchorage.
[02:29:35.329 --> 02:29:37.811]  And it was, I think, it was Methodist then, Methodist University.
[02:29:37.851 --> 02:29:39.552]  But anyway, it was a speaker.
[02:29:39.572 --> 02:29:52.902]  He'd been a priest, a Catholic priest, in China and Russia, in the areas where the Russian republics, the southern republics, buttoned up against China, all amending and stand, you know, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, etc.
[02:29:53.302 --> 02:29:59.086]  Well, all these places, when they moved away and Russia let them go, right, why did they do that?
[02:29:59.739 --> 02:30:00.500]  Why did they do that?
[02:30:00.520 --> 02:30:03.523]  Because they were the biggest growing population.
[02:30:03.603 --> 02:30:09.508]  This Catholic priest was lecturing about 1978 or 1979 when I caught that lecture.
[02:30:09.528 --> 02:30:11.350]  So this is a long time ago again.
[02:30:11.370 --> 02:30:15.714]  And I was in my early 20s listening to this lecture.
[02:30:15.994 --> 02:30:20.438]  And what he said was the biggest threat to China and Russia was Islam.
[02:30:21.204 --> 02:30:24.909]  Because they weren't adhering to the Chinese rule of one kid.
[02:30:25.410 --> 02:30:28.875]  And in Russia, they were the biggest growing population there.
[02:30:29.336 --> 02:30:35.745]  And they were outnumbering in Russia, or former USSR, the white Europeans and Russians.
[02:30:37.583 --> 02:30:38.724]  Yeah, I think so.
[02:30:57.373 --> 02:30:58.894]  And I can't make those judgments.
[02:30:59.474 --> 02:31:02.036]  So that's for people within a culture to make.
[02:31:02.056 --> 02:31:03.557]  That's why we have sovereign nations.
[02:31:03.597 --> 02:31:09.700]  That's why we have structures that we have because that's reality that we all know on the ground when we travel around the world.
[02:31:10.020 --> 02:31:15.923]  But also having said that, the soul of man, no matter where you go, it's all in there.
[02:31:16.484 --> 02:31:17.304]  It's all in there.
[02:31:17.724 --> 02:31:21.907]  And it's about waking everyone up and everyone is doing their part.
[02:31:22.007 --> 02:31:25.909]  And there are people waking up in China and Russia and everywhere.
[02:31:26.525 --> 02:31:27.285]  And there have been.
[02:31:27.745 --> 02:31:34.747]  And I think some of the greatest things may come out of these places that had experienced, in our lifetime, some of the greatest repressions.
[02:31:35.467 --> 02:31:36.987]  You know, what Russia came out of.
[02:31:37.367 --> 02:31:41.708]  And yeah, they're still evolving into a more mature democracy and they got a ways to go.
[02:31:42.308 --> 02:31:47.929]  China, they got a revolution yet to have, you know, and hopefully they do someday.
[02:31:48.389 --> 02:31:53.890]  The kind of revolution that liberates individual souls outside of a collective squishy ant farm.
[02:31:54.617 --> 02:31:56.058]  Because that's what is.
[02:31:56.378 --> 02:32:01.701]  Now, the Chinese have been cracking down on Islamic people.
[02:32:03.042 --> 02:32:05.763]  You know, this is wrong, the way they've done this.
[02:32:05.803 --> 02:32:11.366]  They've herded them all into camps for re-education to get them to renounce their beliefs and religion.
[02:32:11.386 --> 02:32:16.029]  Now, whether you and I believe it or not, what I do believe in is this.
[02:32:16.649 --> 02:32:19.791]  I believe in religious freedom, one of the foundations of this nation.
[02:32:20.402 --> 02:32:27.847]  That people should be free to worship if they wish, whether you're Jewish or Islam or Christian or Muslim or Hindu.
[02:32:27.987 --> 02:32:28.787]  I don't care.
[02:32:29.628 --> 02:32:38.253]  You have the freedom to do that as an individual, but they are rounding people up and putting them in camps because of what they believe.
[02:32:38.991 --> 02:32:42.334]  And this is speech at the fundamental core.
[02:32:42.754 --> 02:32:48.500]  And where are the voices of the liberal left in this country as millions have been herded into camps?
[02:32:49.100 --> 02:32:52.003]  And we're just worried about how much business we can do.
[02:32:52.643 --> 02:32:53.524]  This is Nick Begich.
[02:32:53.544 --> 02:32:54.645]  You're in the InfoWars.
[02:32:54.665 --> 02:32:55.266]  We'll be right back.
[02:32:56.347 --> 02:32:57.428]  And welcome back.
[02:32:57.608 --> 02:33:01.091]  You know, talking about just before the break, we're talking a little bit about
[02:33:02.338 --> 02:33:09.640]  Russia, kind of what's happening there in the rise of Islam in terms of China right now, they got a problem.
[02:33:10.960 --> 02:33:18.441]  Russia, by the changes in their boundaries and how they broke up, they don't have the same issues.
[02:33:18.461 --> 02:33:26.123]  They've kept the bulk of the wealth of the nation, if you will, of the old Soviet republics in Russia.
[02:33:26.783 --> 02:33:36.148]  And and also the republics that were spun off and allowed measure of their liberty under the sphere of influence that the Russians have in their in their area.
[02:33:36.188 --> 02:33:38.150]  That's same as us in our area.
[02:33:38.170 --> 02:33:39.750]  You know, that's kind of how it's been.
[02:33:41.091 --> 02:33:45.734]  But they have resources to tremendous oil, gas, natural resources of all kinds.
[02:33:46.374 --> 02:33:51.757]  And and then you've got China that needs a lot of resources and has a lot of resources developing.
[02:33:51.797 --> 02:33:52.457]  There's also
[02:33:54.156 --> 02:33:56.398]  And then you have the technology.
[02:33:57.018 --> 02:34:11.968]  And this is interesting because as at last hour, you know, talking about when they got into this, that little bit about the weapons and the sonic weapons and the microwave weapons, it made me think about China generally and how they look at things.
[02:34:12.882 --> 02:34:26.216]  And if you go back, and I've read 3 feet, 4 feet of literature on China, going back 3,000 years to some of their ancient philosophy, and read it all the way into the current frame, because I really want to know how people think the best I can.
[02:34:26.256 --> 02:34:28.458]  I mean, I can't be 100% there, but I can get maybe 70%.
[02:34:29.199 --> 02:34:31.962]  I think that's the best anyone can do when you're trying to interpret
[02:34:32.683 --> 02:34:35.704]  Anyone else from because you only do it through your own filter.
[02:34:35.724 --> 02:34:36.964]  That's just the way it is.
[02:34:37.524 --> 02:34:41.625]  But as I look at what's happened, the knowledge of energy is a basic science.
[02:34:41.665 --> 02:34:43.946]  Think about Qigong and what that is.
[02:34:44.426 --> 02:34:46.386]  Think about acupuncture and what that is.
[02:34:46.446 --> 02:34:48.747]  Now, acupuncture I know a good deal about.
[02:34:48.907 --> 02:34:51.788]  In fact, it's a measure of skin resistance.
[02:34:51.868 --> 02:34:59.950]  In other words, energetic differentials that can be discerned on the surface of skin that doesn't line up with the nervous system or the muscular system or the circulatory system.
[02:34:59.990 --> 02:35:00.850]  It's a separate system.
[02:35:01.210 --> 02:35:10.704]  It's an energetic system, and I have little devices that you can put across the surface of the skin, and in lectures I demonstrate them, and every place there's an acupuncture point, you'll get a signal.
[02:35:10.744 --> 02:35:16.993]  You'll get a little lightness and an auditory signal that'll tell you, hey, you're on the mark, because there's an energetic signal.
[02:35:17.617 --> 02:35:22.639]  Now, manipulating those energetic fields is what EM weapons are about.
[02:35:22.839 --> 02:35:24.860]  It's what the new technology is all about.
[02:35:25.260 --> 02:35:38.086]  The idea of taking energy itself and shaping, forming and pulsing it in certain ways that couple with the human body that then allow you to sort of grab a bit of control.
[02:35:38.106 --> 02:35:45.469]  Now, this is getting more refined, or it's what I call in technology, higher and higher resolution.
[02:35:46.287 --> 02:35:51.272]  As our speed of computing and density of computing continues to rise.
[02:35:51.893 --> 02:35:58.620]  And so if you look at a lot of the work I've done in this area, you can look at one of the books in particular, Controlling the Human Mind.
[02:35:58.660 --> 02:36:04.606]  Now it's a little bit dated now, but all of it is as fresh as you need to get the issues
[02:36:05.547 --> 02:36:10.290]  Understood, because what's happened since that publication is we've gone a lot further.
[02:36:10.551 --> 02:36:12.312]  And so the resolution has gotten better.
[02:36:12.772 --> 02:36:18.717]  And back in 10, 15 years ago, what you could do is manipulate emotions quite easily.
[02:36:18.737 --> 02:36:19.678]  You can do that today.
[02:36:20.219 --> 02:36:33.850]  But the idea of manipulating specific ideas, thoughts, how to program literally masses and individuals, or how to extract information and know what people are thinking and then how to send messages back in.
[02:36:35.034 --> 02:36:38.575]  These are the things that are here now and coming.
[02:36:38.955 --> 02:36:43.116]  Now, there was a publication, Technology Horizons.
[02:36:43.176 --> 02:36:44.536]  It was an Air Force publication.
[02:36:45.476 --> 02:36:47.836]  And I've got a clipping back in June 2002.
[02:36:47.976 --> 02:36:51.737]  It's cited in Controlling the Human Mind.
[02:36:51.777 --> 02:37:02.579]  Why it's important is where the government was going then, when this was written, was to create systems that would replicate all of the senses.
[02:37:03.271 --> 02:37:11.398]  Touch, taste, smell, sight, sound in such a way to create complete memory sets that would be indistinguishable.
[02:37:12.038 --> 02:37:12.739]  Let me say that again.
[02:37:13.179 --> 02:37:19.184]  Complete memories that would be indistinguishable from a real experience.
[02:37:20.285 --> 02:37:22.527]  Now, what does that do to testimony in courts?
[02:37:23.368 --> 02:37:25.309]  What does that do to learning systems?
[02:37:25.369 --> 02:37:32.295]  If you can push information in and just sort of shove it into your long term memory, that's where this is going.
[02:37:33.018 --> 02:37:35.219]  So then who controls curriculum right now?
[02:37:35.239 --> 02:37:36.920]  You go, oh, I can screen it out.
[02:37:37.000 --> 02:37:37.640]  I'm the parent.
[02:37:37.700 --> 02:37:38.780]  I can look through the books.
[02:37:39.420 --> 02:37:41.281]  No, this can be a very different system coming.
[02:37:41.961 --> 02:37:51.785]  This will be the download, the interface, you see, the worldwide mind that even PBS did a special on by that night.
[02:37:52.105 --> 02:37:52.565]  Look it up.
[02:37:52.805 --> 02:37:57.027]  The worldwide mind, the connection of all the brains in the world.
[02:37:58.268 --> 02:37:59.288]  No privacy then.
[02:38:00.382 --> 02:38:03.683]  Minority Report, if you ever saw the movie, we'll be living it.
[02:38:04.163 --> 02:38:06.223]  Maybe we already are to a certain extent.
[02:38:06.603 --> 02:38:08.123]  I believe we are to a certain extent.
[02:38:08.523 --> 02:38:19.725]  Although they can't reach into everybody's brain right now, how they push us around and hurt us like animals that we are not is what's been happening.
[02:38:20.425 --> 02:38:22.226]  Chinese are really good at it.
[02:38:22.666 --> 02:38:30.127]  They suppress anything, even their own history, root belief of energetic science and what it means.
[02:38:30.962 --> 02:38:38.905]  Because all of this translates into closer and closer to what we are, the closer we get.
[02:38:38.965 --> 02:38:46.127]  You know, see, it's not just Muslims and Islam they're suppressing in China, it's Christianity and Christians too.
[02:38:46.887 --> 02:38:53.330]  And it's Fei Gong and everyone else, anyone that looks deeper than the flesh.
[02:38:53.830 --> 02:38:58.731]  And the search for depth is necessary for everyone.
[02:38:58.811 --> 02:39:00.192]  And you get that search by
[02:39:01.008 --> 02:39:03.669]  Looking, seeking, so you can find something.
[02:39:04.410 --> 02:39:05.850]  Look at the story of Solomon.
[02:39:06.110 --> 02:39:06.911]  He went everywhere.
[02:39:06.931 --> 02:39:08.952]  He looked at every occult thing in his time.
[02:39:09.292 --> 02:39:13.854]  If he were living today and doing those studies, there'd be a lot of Christians want to burn him at stake.
[02:39:14.934 --> 02:39:16.335]  Okay, but it was his path.
[02:39:16.835 --> 02:39:20.077]  He learned a lot, became the wisest man in the world as a result.
[02:39:20.957 --> 02:39:22.538]  So don't judge another man's path.
[02:39:22.598 --> 02:39:23.138]  Judge your own.
[02:39:23.178 --> 02:39:24.919]  Let God judge the path of the other man.
[02:39:25.579 --> 02:39:27.300]  Because judging not lest ye be judged.
[02:39:27.320 --> 02:39:29.001]  And I think that has a lot of power in it.
[02:39:30.191 --> 02:39:31.933]  But you can make a judgment.
[02:39:32.053 --> 02:39:35.056]  Don't be too hard on yourself, but make a judgment about yourself.
[02:39:35.136 --> 02:39:36.997]  Are you engaging the world in the way you should?
[02:39:38.238 --> 02:39:39.640]  Only you can answer that question.
[02:39:39.680 --> 02:39:42.122]  No one else can answer that for you, even though a lot of people will try.
[02:39:42.142 --> 02:39:46.646]  And you might have been one of those trying to tell someone else's programming to.
[02:39:47.087 --> 02:39:47.847]  But here's the deal.
[02:39:48.308 --> 02:39:50.450]  You know your flaws better than anyone except God.
[02:39:50.810 --> 02:39:51.831]  You know them all.
[02:39:52.211 --> 02:39:52.852]  No one else does.
[02:39:53.590 --> 02:40:01.432]  But if you're so critical and so hard on yourself and you crush yourself with your own criticism, this is judgment against the creation.
[02:40:03.413 --> 02:40:04.413]  Let me say that again.
[02:40:04.433 --> 02:40:12.595]  This is you making such a harsh judgment of something created in the image and likeness of God yourself.
[02:40:14.315 --> 02:40:16.836]  Okay, be critical, be correcting,
[02:40:18.003 --> 02:40:26.311]  Change, you know, repentance is about change, not about just saying, I'm sorry and going on and doing whatever you're doing, saying you're sorry a bunch of times and showing up to the priest to say, oh, I'm sorry.
[02:40:26.951 --> 02:40:28.693]  No, it's about change, fundamental change.
[02:40:28.713 --> 02:40:35.960]  But that comes from knowing and then deciding and then acting and doing and falling back into your powers, created human beings.
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:41.244]  So you get your power back and then miraculous things begin to happen in your life and everyone around you.
[02:40:41.404 --> 02:40:43.026]  So there are no options then.
[02:40:43.897 --> 02:40:44.778]  That is the option.
[02:40:45.098 --> 02:41:00.270]  So the suppression of the human spirit is what the Chai Kams recognize, and the globalists recognize, and they use fear and all manner of control to accomplish that.
[02:41:01.010 --> 02:41:03.432]  And that is becoming more widespread.
[02:41:03.532 --> 02:41:05.534]  China's just the model to look at.
[02:41:05.994 --> 02:41:07.075]  Globalists look at it.
[02:41:07.115 --> 02:41:08.836]  That's where they're making most of their money.
[02:41:08.876 --> 02:41:11.979]  Look at where they've made their money over the last
[02:41:13.077 --> 02:41:21.622]  40, 50 years since 1971 when we opened up China with Nixon and Kissinger.
[02:41:22.462 --> 02:41:23.703]  We closed the gold window.
[02:41:23.763 --> 02:41:24.683]  We opened China.
[02:41:24.723 --> 02:41:26.924]  They went from bicycles to Mercedes.
[02:41:27.425 --> 02:41:33.088]  And here we are in the United States with Chinese virus and millions unemployed.
[02:41:33.108 --> 02:41:37.670]  And they've killed a few hundred thousand and they killed a few million.
[02:41:38.766 --> 02:41:41.748]  And how many died in Vietnam?
[02:41:41.768 --> 02:41:41.748]  57,000.
[02:41:41.908 --> 02:41:44.550]  They've already done five times as many in the U.S.
[02:41:44.650 --> 02:41:45.891]  and not a shot's been fired.
[02:41:46.431 --> 02:41:48.512]  It's the Chinese virus, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:41:48.872 --> 02:41:50.814]  And I'm not saying Chinese are bad people.
[02:41:50.854 --> 02:41:55.277]  I'm saying whoever did that are bad people, regardless of who they are.
[02:41:56.157 --> 02:42:02.241]  But what I do know is whoever's taking advantage of this opportunity are not our friends.
[02:42:03.163 --> 02:42:05.247]  And they're not necessarily their own allies.
[02:42:05.327 --> 02:42:11.958]  They just have different agendas, and they're all zeroing in on the opportunity to screw America and screw the planet.
[02:42:12.399 --> 02:42:15.303]  And we're the Infowars, and we are the wall against that.
[02:42:15.363 --> 02:42:16.105]  This is Nick Begich.
[02:42:16.125 --> 02:42:16.766]  We'll be right back.
[02:42:18.095 --> 02:42:21.738]  Hey, I want to say thanks for being here on this Friday afternoon.
[02:42:21.758 --> 02:42:31.826]  I always try and get the fourth hour, as I know everyone's heard all the details of all the garbage going on with the election.
[02:42:31.846 --> 02:42:39.012]  Alex has been doing incredible work getting people out there to be talking about this issue.
[02:42:40.373 --> 02:42:43.757]  And I try to not kind of get into all of the same themes.
[02:42:43.817 --> 02:42:49.123]  And I try to take this last hour and kind of wrap the week up with maybe a little bit of a lift.
[02:42:49.383 --> 02:42:53.068]  At least that's my hope in all of this.
[02:42:53.829 --> 02:42:55.230]  Because I'm just that way.
[02:42:55.250 --> 02:42:57.713]  I'm a pathological optimist.
[02:42:57.973 --> 02:42:58.873]  I can't help myself.
[02:42:58.953 --> 02:43:06.055]  And I believe in this Republic, and I believe in living human souls, and I believe that we win this battle in the end.
[02:43:06.355 --> 02:43:09.556]  And we win it in the flesh, we win it in the spirit, we win it.
[02:43:10.036 --> 02:43:10.496]  Period.
[02:43:10.916 --> 02:43:12.697]  So, we're in it to win it.
[02:43:13.517 --> 02:43:14.537]  And this is what I would say too.
[02:43:14.797 --> 02:43:17.118]  Now, I talked a little bit about China in the last segments.
[02:43:17.578 --> 02:43:20.599]  I want to say this, because I don't know if there's people out there in China listening.
[02:43:20.659 --> 02:43:21.479]  I hope there are.
[02:43:21.499 --> 02:43:24.880]  I really do, because here's what I know.
[02:43:25.902 --> 02:43:30.430]  All around the planet, people hear this program and hear this broadcast and hear our voices.
[02:43:31.091 --> 02:43:33.235]  Individually and collectively, your voices too.
[02:43:33.395 --> 02:43:36.381]  Everyone we speak to, this matters right now.
[02:43:37.182 --> 02:43:38.705]  And if we do just a little bit,
[02:43:39.406 --> 02:43:53.150]  To make a situation happen where people begin to look again, to seek the truth and to begin to really try and discern what's real and what isn't as we begin to push into the world instead of being pushed around.
[02:43:53.170 --> 02:43:54.691]  We've got to find our power in that.
[02:43:55.091 --> 02:43:57.011]  And so for that, we have to let go of fear.
[02:43:57.071 --> 02:43:58.472]  We have to let go of anxiety.
[02:43:58.792 --> 02:43:59.892]  Now, this is pretty rough.
[02:44:00.453 --> 02:44:05.334]  You know, I mean, in fact, I think it's by design.
[02:44:05.394 --> 02:44:08.215]  If you think about it, it is by design.
[02:44:09.139 --> 02:44:15.392]  If we are kept in that state, because that's when we're the most vulnerable and the least capable.
[02:44:17.552 --> 02:44:19.974]  When I say that, it's not a metaphor.
[02:44:20.034 --> 02:44:22.055]  It's not kind of like, oh, I think this.
[02:44:22.535 --> 02:44:24.577]  The science proves this.
[02:44:25.237 --> 02:44:36.664]  It's what I've been writing about for most of my career in terms of this this area of technology is this technology that either liberates us or frees us.
[02:44:37.004 --> 02:44:40.347]  It's the airplane that either drops from or delivers the mail.
[02:44:40.827 --> 02:44:42.508]  OK, it's the operator.
[02:44:43.109 --> 02:44:44.109]  That gets to decide.
[02:44:44.149 --> 02:44:56.214]  That's both individually with us and collectively as a country, as a state, as a local locality and other countries and then globally what we do to kind of get along.
[02:44:56.872 --> 02:44:59.473]  And here's some things I want to bring out again.
[02:44:59.493 --> 02:45:05.395]  And it used to be the John Birchers warning about all this and everybody poo-pooing them in the 60s.
[02:45:05.796 --> 02:45:09.317]  And then now all that stuff is now mainstream.
[02:45:09.377 --> 02:45:15.819]  And I don't know what their agenda is today, but it's kind of like, well, you were right, but nobody paid attention.
[02:45:16.600 --> 02:45:17.460]  And I look at this.
[02:45:17.500 --> 02:45:18.200]  What were they saying?
[02:45:18.220 --> 02:45:19.621]  They were talking about new world order.
[02:45:20.310 --> 02:45:23.051]  There was a good book, None Dare Call a Conspiracy.
[02:45:23.131 --> 02:45:24.212]  I highly recommend it.
[02:45:24.252 --> 02:45:24.892]  Gary Allen.
[02:45:24.932 --> 02:45:27.253]  I read it years and years ago.
[02:45:27.273 --> 02:45:30.115]  And there was another one he wrote called Jimmy Carter, Jimmy Carter.
[02:45:30.155 --> 02:45:31.875]  And I recommend that one to 19 1970s vintage.
[02:45:31.915 --> 02:45:35.897]  You know, the story has been told over and over again.
[02:45:40.554 --> 02:45:41.934]  But a lot of people haven't heard it.
[02:45:42.695 --> 02:45:45.295]  The mainstream is really shutting it down.
[02:45:45.315 --> 02:45:47.016]  There's a cover on the screen.
[02:45:47.536 --> 02:45:54.598]  You know, and so you have all these things happening in the world, and really it's about silencing our voices.
[02:45:55.378 --> 02:45:57.098]  And this is what we can't allow to happen.
[02:45:57.538 --> 02:46:02.380]  And in these last days of the fire drill, we're seeing some things.
[02:46:02.420 --> 02:46:04.160]  Now, I know Owen was talking about
[02:46:05.175 --> 02:46:06.877]  What was going on with Trump's press release?
[02:46:06.937 --> 02:46:08.178]  Now, what press comps?
[02:46:08.218 --> 02:46:09.479]  Now, why was he talking about those?
[02:46:09.499 --> 02:46:11.441]  Because these are things you couldn't legislate.
[02:46:11.461 --> 02:46:13.983]  Because Big Pharma doesn't want any of this legislated.
[02:46:14.003 --> 02:46:15.565]  There's things they don't want legislated.
[02:46:15.965 --> 02:46:17.727]  Executive order is the order of the day.
[02:46:17.807 --> 02:46:18.848]  Let's get our speech back.
[02:46:18.888 --> 02:46:25.213]  Let's shut down these tech giants that are now directing speech traffic.
[02:46:26.204 --> 02:46:27.385]  And filtering speech out.
[02:46:27.846 --> 02:46:29.727]  No, they're public conveyances.
[02:46:29.767 --> 02:46:30.568]  They can't do that.
[02:46:30.608 --> 02:46:31.629]  These are the airwaves.
[02:46:31.649 --> 02:46:32.330]  They don't own them.
[02:46:32.690 --> 02:46:33.971]  Let's just take them away.
[02:46:33.991 --> 02:46:44.021]  They can keep the money they have, but we got to take them away and restore order to the public airwaves so all voices can be heard and no one gets to filter them out.
[02:46:44.821 --> 02:46:47.504]  That's the only public order is that.
[02:46:49.285 --> 02:46:50.727]  You know, we cannot allow
[02:46:51.505 --> 02:46:57.588]  The owners of the media now to control the airwaves, which are all of ours.
[02:46:58.109 --> 02:47:00.470]  This was the principles of the FCC.
[02:47:00.790 --> 02:47:06.953]  See, nobody remembers any of this because when radio was invented is where these discussions happened over a hundred years ago.
[02:47:07.994 --> 02:47:14.537]  See, no one's having the discussions today because we just let it kind of ooze its way in.
[02:47:16.784 --> 02:47:21.227]  One slice at a time until the bologna is all gone and we don't notice.
[02:47:21.307 --> 02:47:24.929]  Or the slow boil of the frog, whatever example you want to use.
[02:47:26.249 --> 02:47:32.873]  But you've got to live long enough and have a memory strong enough and I pray to God I keep mine for another 40 years and can keep talking.
[02:47:32.893 --> 02:47:37.776]  Because then I'll have a hundred years of experience instead of just the 62 I have right now.
[02:47:38.376 --> 02:47:43.759]  And you, all of you together, we have millions of years of experience.
[02:47:45.071 --> 02:47:46.092]  Think about this.
[02:47:46.652 --> 02:47:53.816]  Collectively, we have millions of years of experience in your household, the two adults and the children.
[02:47:53.836 --> 02:47:55.377]  How many years of experience do you have?
[02:47:55.838 --> 02:47:58.619]  It's all different experience, all seen through your individual filters.
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:06.824]  When our consciousness comes together, we don't need to wait for some AI-assisted worldwide mind.
[02:48:07.585 --> 02:48:08.625]  We already have one.
[02:48:10.066 --> 02:48:10.566]  We're in it.
[02:48:12.488 --> 02:48:13.008]  We're in it.
[02:48:14.173 --> 02:48:15.714]  It's what we were created to be.
[02:48:15.754 --> 02:48:16.474]  It's who we are.
[02:48:17.675 --> 02:48:25.558]  And again, I want to say in the context of the world right now, people are being suppressed in all different ways.
[02:48:26.459 --> 02:48:32.602]  And when people are suppressed, they get angry because that runs against who we are as created human beings.
[02:48:32.622 --> 02:48:35.463]  We're not meant to be under house arrest.
[02:48:36.844 --> 02:48:37.564]  In jail.
[02:48:38.300 --> 02:48:41.801]  Without having anyone bringing us our meals.
[02:48:43.942 --> 02:48:47.963]  You know, we're in jail, folks, if we succumb to this.
[02:48:47.983 --> 02:48:49.744]  Because it'll be one slice at a time.
[02:48:49.804 --> 02:48:53.765]  It started, remember, it was only 15 days and now we're nine months in.
[02:48:54.465 --> 02:48:56.386]  And the lockdowns look like they're coming.
[02:48:57.346 --> 02:48:59.507]  You know, what is going on here, folks?
[02:49:00.087 --> 02:49:01.907]  House arrest and we're all buying in.
[02:49:01.927 --> 02:49:04.948]  And then they're going to allocate a little money to everyone.
[02:49:05.969 --> 02:49:07.209]  Hush money, let's call it.
[02:49:08.368 --> 02:49:11.831]  Well, the banks are running the skim game of taking a little bit off the top.
[02:49:14.233 --> 02:49:18.276]  And it's like they've just created a whole new context of words to make us feel good.
[02:49:18.736 --> 02:49:19.697]  Oh, it's a quarantine.
[02:49:19.757 --> 02:49:20.497]  It's not jail.
[02:49:21.398 --> 02:49:22.879]  Oh, it's an allocation.
[02:49:22.899 --> 02:49:24.220]  It's a tax refund.
[02:49:24.280 --> 02:49:25.942]  It's not a allowance.
[02:49:26.542 --> 02:49:29.124]  You know, this is nonsense, folks.
[02:49:30.425 --> 02:49:32.066]  Really, let's look at the effect.
[02:49:32.387 --> 02:49:34.648]  OK, let's not think about the words and the illusion.
[02:49:34.688 --> 02:49:35.549]  Let's think of the effect.
[02:49:35.909 --> 02:49:36.670]  Do you feel free?
[02:49:37.090 --> 02:49:38.071]  Do you feel liberated?
[02:49:39.468 --> 02:49:40.549]  Do you feel sovereign?
[02:49:41.770 --> 02:49:45.692]  If you don't, something's wrong, because that's what we were created to be.
[02:49:46.293 --> 02:50:05.727]  Three sovereign living souls in the image and likeness of God, being creative, doing creative work, not being diminished and told we're nothing, that we're some herd that needs to be herded, we're a group of taxpayers who need to just pay, or that we're just consumers who just need to keep grabbing and eating and, hey, they'll just crank out more money so we can just consume.
[02:50:06.343 --> 02:50:08.664]  No, that is not what we were created to do.
[02:50:09.184 --> 02:50:10.764]  A lot of people have lost in that illusion.
[02:50:10.784 --> 02:50:11.865]  That's their deal.
[02:50:11.925 --> 02:50:15.146]  Hopefully, they'll find a way out.
[02:50:15.246 --> 02:50:23.628]  But our individual path that dictates what we do is based on a set of values, and those values are being lost in the shuffle.
[02:50:23.648 --> 02:50:24.589]  Let's not let that happen.
[02:50:25.389 --> 02:50:28.170]  As we roll into this next decade,
[02:50:29.293 --> 02:50:30.754]  Of unrest kicking in.
[02:50:30.774 --> 02:50:33.315]  But let's get some executive orders going.
[02:50:33.355 --> 02:50:34.536]  Let's get our speech back.
[02:50:34.576 --> 02:50:36.937]  Let's do as much as we can while we can.
[02:50:38.238 --> 02:50:42.520]  Just in case the Chi-Coms win the fights that are taking place right now.
[02:50:42.540 --> 02:50:43.961]  And I know Trump's team is on it.
[02:50:44.761 --> 02:50:47.883]  They've got the best team I imagine in the world on it.
[02:50:48.556 --> 02:50:50.537]  Hopefully this thing gets quickly to the U.S.
[02:50:50.577 --> 02:51:00.441]  Supreme Court, the evidence gets weighed, and testimony gets heard from individuals that can lend an ear to the truth in this, so we can see what happened.
[02:51:00.461 --> 02:51:07.003]  Because one thing is for sure, half the country doubts the outcome of this election, and that's too many.
[02:51:07.804 --> 02:51:08.704]  We can't have that.
[02:51:09.144 --> 02:51:14.166]  We can't go forward into this century doubting our electoral processes.
[02:51:15.007 --> 02:51:17.908]  These have to be dealt with, and I've said it before,
[02:51:18.883 --> 02:51:22.407]  And I say it again, these machines cannot be trusted.
[02:51:23.127 --> 02:51:23.608]  They can't.
[02:51:24.408 --> 02:51:27.592]  Computers cannot be trusted to be foolproof.
[02:51:28.292 --> 02:51:28.753]  They aren't.
[02:51:29.654 --> 02:51:35.559]  That's the business of the info wars, you know, that are taking place outside of this venue.
[02:51:36.500 --> 02:51:41.245]  These are the real wars going on at a very, very high level.
[02:51:42.083 --> 02:51:45.205]  And Alex, as a visionary, grabbed that name, right?
[02:51:45.865 --> 02:51:46.765]  Because he saw it.
[02:51:47.066 --> 02:51:47.586]  He saw it.
[02:51:47.746 --> 02:51:49.106]  He saw it 25 years ago.
[02:51:49.587 --> 02:51:53.889]  And my slogan back then was, changing the way we see the world.
[02:51:54.549 --> 02:51:56.330]  Because what I was seeing
[02:51:57.932 --> 02:52:05.898]  It was way different than what the mainstream was seeing, and so change the way we see the world is gather the information and make new judgments.
[02:52:06.378 --> 02:52:10.721]  Make a judgment about your life today and how you're going to engage the world this weekend.
[02:52:11.121 --> 02:52:16.425]  This is Dr. Nick Begich, and you've been listening to The Info Wars, the most important broadcast on the planet.
[02:52:16.986 --> 02:52:18.287]  Remember The Info Wars.

[02:52:35.134 --> 02:52:38.296]  The globalists are trying to censor what you can see and what you can share.
[02:52:38.616 --> 02:52:39.397]  Don't let them win.

[02:53:04.336 --> 02:53:11.700]  Most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[02:53:12.380 --> 02:53:18.703]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive and muscle loss.
[02:53:19.543 --> 02:53:24.766]  Alpha Power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.
[02:53:25.387 --> 02:53:43.638]  The secret is in the synergistic blend of ancient ingredients that have been concentrated into their most potent forms, including Uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia, Makaroo from Peru, Horny Goatweed from China, and Tribulus from India.

[02:55:27.887 --> 02:55:31.708]  You know, natural test, boost all these things that's so good for your immunity.
[02:55:31.728 --> 02:55:33.528]  Nothing does that like boosting your test.
[02:55:34.429 --> 02:55:37.669]  It was a bestseller under Anthroplex, but somebody had a copyright.
[02:55:37.689 --> 02:55:38.330]  They threatened this.
[02:55:38.670 --> 02:55:39.950]  So I changed the name to Alpha Power.
[02:55:40.150 --> 02:55:41.770]  Super strong, super high quality.
[02:55:41.790 --> 02:55:42.831]  We haven't had this in a year.
[02:55:42.851 --> 02:55:46.912]  Because I waited, and then by the time COVID hit, we couldn't get it in, in the high quality version.
[02:55:46.992 --> 02:55:50.112]  It finally was available, and the company told us that we're getting a supply from.
[02:55:50.152 --> 02:55:51.433]  We may go out of business.
[02:55:52.293 --> 02:55:56.936]  Because of the total lockdown, you better put in a bigger order if you ever want to get it again.
[02:55:57.176 --> 02:55:58.397]  We may close in the new year.
[02:55:58.417 --> 02:56:00.519]  Now, why is this product special?
[02:56:00.579 --> 02:56:01.499]  What is in this?
[02:56:01.740 --> 02:56:02.300]  What does it do?
[02:56:02.360 --> 02:56:06.743]  Well, it's got a bunch of things in it, but it's got these proprietary ingredients.
[02:56:07.123 --> 02:56:16.790]  LJ-100, urecoma, long phalangia, organic maca, horny goat weed, tribulus fruit extract, rice grain concentrate, niacin and zinc.
[02:56:16.830 --> 02:56:17.070]  By the way,
[02:56:17.090 --> 02:56:19.552]  We were putting zinc in this before zinc and things are cool.
[02:56:19.592 --> 02:56:21.494]  Zinc just supercharges everything you do.
[02:56:21.514 --> 02:56:22.695]  It's got an organic zinc in it.
[02:56:22.795 --> 02:56:23.636]  It's back in stock.

[02:56:27.780 --> 02:56:29.602]  And it funds this whole operation.
[02:56:29.782 --> 02:56:31.083]  Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula.
[02:56:31.103 --> 02:56:31.744]  Sold out for months.
[02:56:31.804 --> 02:56:32.465]  Back in stock.
[02:56:32.505 --> 02:56:35.628]  So good for your cells, so good for your immunity, so good for your inflammation.

[02:56:37.930 --> 02:56:40.672]  DNA Force Plus is the one thing I'd be doing other than X2.
[02:56:40.872 --> 02:56:42.213]  X2, clean, pure iodine.
[02:56:42.233 --> 02:56:43.874]  It's essential for all human activity.
[02:56:43.954 --> 02:56:46.917]  As much as I'm stressed out, as much as I fight, as much as I do, I could not operate.
[02:56:46.957 --> 02:56:48.598]  I'd be dead without taking these products.
[02:56:48.618 --> 02:56:49.799]  When I forget to take them, I feel it.
[02:56:49.819 --> 02:56:50.579]  Now, it's expensive.
[02:56:50.679 --> 02:56:54.702]  DNA Force Plus is expensive because PQQ and CoQ10 of the high-quality forms are very expensive.
[02:56:54.742 --> 02:56:57.804]  You can't find formulas with anywhere near this dose for anywhere near this price.
[02:56:57.844 --> 02:56:58.385]  Look at that.
[02:56:58.565 --> 02:56:59.446]  99% reviews.

[02:57:09.535 --> 02:57:13.481]  We need a lot of money to fund this operation, be able to do all this, and take on the globalists.
[02:57:13.501 --> 02:57:14.483]  You want to see more action?

[02:57:16.426 --> 02:57:17.507]  I'm just saying, point blank.
[02:57:17.567 --> 02:57:18.329]  Stop the steal.
[02:57:18.429 --> 02:57:20.192]  Republican crisis sale right now.
[02:57:20.212 --> 02:57:21.073]  American crisis.
[02:57:21.113 --> 02:57:22.395]  Emergency lockdown 2 coming.
