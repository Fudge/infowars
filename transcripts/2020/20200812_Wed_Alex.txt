[00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:08.070]  There's a normalcy bias with people that just think, oh, Kamala Harris, total fraud, polls at 1%.
[00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:09.051]  She's a joke.
[00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:12.011]  They're going to contest the election.
[00:00:13.331 --> 00:00:17.292]  They're going to then say that the states are succeeding along the popular vote.
[00:00:17.752 --> 00:00:23.553]  They've said they're going to have their own inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris at some undisclosed location.
[00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:25.013]  I played Pelosi yesterday.
[00:00:25.193 --> 00:00:26.714]  They're not joking!
[00:00:27.654 --> 00:00:29.034]  They're not joking!
[00:00:31.641 --> 00:00:38.884]  And when they try to burn down federal courthouses and shoot police officers, if the police fight back, they'll be arrested, so the police are going to stand down.
[00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:42.206]  And if citizens go out and fight back, the news will say we're terrorists.
[00:00:43.547 --> 00:00:50.770]  Hollywood, the mainstream media, the whole culture, it's all globalist, hate America, all making its move now.
[00:00:52.531 --> 00:00:53.691]  It will blow up in their face.
[00:00:53.752 --> 00:00:54.792]  It will be a disaster.
[00:00:54.832 --> 00:01:00.775]  It will trigger a bloody civil war that will be Alexander Soros and Jordan Soros' final countdown.
[00:01:02.222 --> 00:01:03.663]  And final, Waterloo.
[00:01:04.583 --> 00:01:07.365]  But, there's no reason to let this happen.
[00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:22.194]  If every person, it's extremely politically active, if every person listening tells people about this show and this live feed and these topics and if we make other talk radio and Fox News cover this and make the president take it head on, they'll have to back down and I know a blueprint to stop them.
[00:01:22.474 --> 00:01:27.377]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:31.021 --> 00:01:40.624]  There's an old saying in Tennessee, I know it's in Texas, probably in Tennessee, that says fool me once, shame on, shame on you.
[00:01:43.925 --> 00:01:45.186]  If you fool me, you can't get fooled again.
[00:01:46.508 --> 00:01:54.150]  In 2010, Forbes magazine accurately reported on the WHO's fraudulent response to the swine flu.
[00:01:55.091 --> 00:02:02.793]  The Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe declared the false pandemic is one of the greatest medicine scandals of the century.
[00:02:03.493 --> 00:02:12.279]  By their own rules, a pandemic requires simultaneous epidemics worldwide with enormous numbers of deaths and illness.
[00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:21.946]  11 weeks into the outbreak, only 144 people died worldwide, and the WHO declared a pandemic.
[00:02:22.947 --> 00:02:26.049]  Just one month before, they changed the rules.
[00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.571]  You could now have a pandemic with zero deaths.
[00:02:30.612 --> 00:02:34.437]  And when questioned, they claimed the old rule never existed.
[00:02:34.898 --> 00:02:38.282]  Now, there is some confusion here and I hope to clarify.
[00:02:39.263 --> 00:02:44.369]  Having severe death has never been part of the WHO pandemic.
[00:02:45.257 --> 00:03:00.189]  The WHO director, Dr. Margaret Chan, then went on to push left-wing politics, the redistribution of wealth for equity and social justice, and claimed that a welfare state is the savior of globalism.
[00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.673]  Over $18 billion was misallocated on this fake pandemic.
[00:03:07.153 --> 00:03:12.599]  In 2005, Dr. Peter Doshi published a paper entitled, Are U.S.
[00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:15.582]  Flu Death Figures More PR Than Science?
[00:03:16.423 --> 00:03:18.746]  Drawing upon data from the CDC.
[00:03:19.827 --> 00:03:24.773]  The CDC bundles together influenza and pneumonia and counts them together.
[00:03:25.373 --> 00:03:31.997]  Which is strange, because according to their own data, there are far more deaths caused by pneumonia than the flu.
[00:03:32.597 --> 00:03:39.901]  For example, out of the 62,000 pneumonia and influenza deaths from 2001, only 18 cases were lab-confirmed influenza.
[00:03:39.921 --> 00:03:39.901]  0.03%.
[00:03:39.941 --> 00:03:43.563]  From 1979 to 2002, there were an average of 58 influenza deaths per year.
[00:03:54.642 --> 00:04:08.729]  In 2004, CDC Director Glenn Nowak gave a presentation wherein he called upon the media to state concern and alarm, predict dire outcomes, and urge influenza vaccination.
[00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:21.256]  The Flu Protection Act of 2005 required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct public influenza awareness campaigns preceding every flu season.
[00:04:22.911 --> 00:04:29.378]  Sales of the flu vaccine began skyrocketing, bringing in billions of dollars to the manufacturers.
[00:04:30.278 --> 00:04:33.642]  All for something that kills, on average, less than 100 people a year.
[00:04:36.334 --> 00:04:43.920]  In 2007, the New York Times published an article entitled, Faith in Quick Test Leads to Epidemic That Wasn't.
[00:04:44.801 --> 00:04:59.073]  It explains how the same PCR tests being used now for COVID-19 misdiagnosed over 100 healthcare workers in New Hampshire and rang the bell for a whooping cough epidemic that turned out to just be the common cold.
[00:05:00.254 --> 00:05:03.896]  The PCR tests were never meant to detect a specific virus.
[00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:08.359]  And yet, they are being used today to detect COVID-19.
[00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:18.524]  The CDC even admits that the PCR test will detect any viral infection as COVID-19, including the common cold.
[00:05:19.645 --> 00:05:26.009]  The current data from the CDC on COVID-19 shows the same fakery that we have seen so far.
[00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:38.113]  Just as the CDC falsely counted pneumonia deaths as influenza deaths in the past, they are now counting both pneumonia and influenza as COVID-19.
[00:05:39.073 --> 00:05:41.894]  You can see it clearly in the CDC's own data.
[00:05:42.914 --> 00:05:53.678]  Beginning in the end of March, right after the shutdown began in the U.S., pneumonia and influenza deaths dropped to zero, just as COVID deaths began to surge.
[00:05:54.844 --> 00:05:57.365]  COVID-19 is a quantifiable hoax.
[00:05:58.206 --> 00:06:03.749]  After years of unchecked Big Pharma fraud, we are witnessing their greatest swindle yet.
[00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:09.892]  And the amount of people wearing the mask only illustrates how effective their scam is.
[00:06:10.873 --> 00:06:16.996]  Will the mask wearers take the experimental vaccine for fear of what amounts to be the common cold?
[00:06:18.457 --> 00:06:20.798]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:06:22.939 --> 00:06:23.860]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:06:24.867 --> 00:06:26.309]  It is Wednesday, August 12th.
[00:06:26.329 --> 00:06:26.669]  The year is 2020.
[00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:29.552]  We're 82 days out from the election.
[00:06:30.694 --> 00:06:34.278]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and we come to you again with grave information.
[00:06:34.298 --> 00:06:40.044]  Not to scare you, but in the belief that if you are given the information,
[00:06:41.001 --> 00:06:47.769]  You'll be able to raise the alarm, you'll be able to take action, and we'll be able to overcome what the establishment has now openly announced.
[00:06:47.809 --> 00:06:58.781]  Now, we've looked at all the pieces and all the statements out of the Council on Foreign Relations, out of the Soros crime syndicate, out of Hillary's mouth, out of Obama's mouth, and out of their surrogates' mouths.
[00:06:59.656 --> 00:07:16.347]  And I've read what the Council on Foreign Relations has said, and the Financial Times of London, and the Economist owned by the Rothschilds, and I've watched the Defense Department briefings with the different political wonks, and they've been 100% clear that they plan to contest the election.
[00:07:16.967 --> 00:07:18.588]  They believe they're going to lose in a landslide.
[00:07:18.848 --> 00:07:20.529]  There's a massive political realignment.
[00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:22.731]  The censorship has only pissed people off.
[00:07:23.677 --> 00:07:28.561]  No matter how many mail-in ballots they have or how much fraud, there is about to be a giant landslide.
[00:07:28.941 --> 00:07:37.547]  And top analysts, top professors, top political scientists who've been dead on picking the last five, six elections are all unanimous.
[00:07:37.908 --> 00:07:40.129]  Trump is going to win in a huge landslide.
[00:07:43.372 --> 00:07:52.979]  And I see Limbaugh and Hannity and other talk show hosts and even folks that are here on InfoWars Network who are great people.
[00:07:54.036 --> 00:07:55.697]  Going all, look at Kamala Harris!
[00:07:55.858 --> 00:07:57.559]  She is absolutely reviled.
[00:07:57.599 --> 00:08:01.703]  She was polling at 1% when they tried to make her the frontrunner during the Democrat primaries.
[00:08:02.083 --> 00:08:05.086]  The woman has more baggage than the belly of a 747.
[00:08:05.246 --> 00:08:10.690]  Boy, I tell you, this is really hurting their progressive base.
[00:08:11.071 --> 00:08:13.113]  Democrats are saying they're going to vote for Trump now.
[00:08:16.255 --> 00:08:16.936]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[00:08:18.991 --> 00:08:20.192]  They know they're going to lose.
[00:08:20.292 --> 00:08:27.578]  The strategy is to contest the election and have a woman they can claim is part black so that any criticism of her they can say is racist.
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:36.005]  And so they can then stir up civil war and race war in this country that they've already primed and ignited.
[00:08:37.887 --> 00:08:42.371]  And then they're going to have all the blue states secede, claiming, oh, we're going with the popular vote.
[00:08:43.888 --> 00:08:44.068]  I think?
[00:09:03.032 --> 00:09:14.122]  Last year that it would be Kamala Harris because Jeff Zucker and Jeff Bezos and all of the big Silicon Valley gang and the Chi-Coms want her.
[00:09:15.882 --> 00:09:20.603]  Because she will do whatever they tell her to do, just like Joe Biden.
[00:09:21.183 --> 00:09:25.545]  So it's no longer, oh, Infowars exactly predicted this over a year ago.
[00:09:25.585 --> 00:09:26.185]  We didn't predict it.
[00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:29.086]  They were all admitting that this was one of their main plans.
[00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.606]  And we didn't know they'd go with that plan.
[00:09:31.626 --> 00:09:32.507]  They've got a couple others.
[00:09:33.147 --> 00:09:36.868]  We said bio-attack to lock things down, economic collapse, a big new war.
[00:09:37.128 --> 00:09:38.388]  Looks like they're going with all of them.
[00:09:39.508 --> 00:09:40.869]  They're playing every card they got.
[00:09:42.749 --> 00:09:45.030]  But the contesting the election,
[00:09:46.178 --> 00:09:49.579]  And then trying to drive Trump for power and surrounding the White House.
[00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:56.222]  That's something that I've been saying for two and a half years every day.
[00:09:56.282 --> 00:10:05.845]  And if you remember the video that got me banned on Twitter, Lester Holt and everybody got up on TV with the head of Twitter and said, you know, Jones
[00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:10.512]  Threatened to use battle rifles to come kill the media.
[00:10:10.712 --> 00:10:11.472]  They never showed a clip.
[00:10:11.512 --> 00:10:12.033]  I didn't say it.
[00:10:12.493 --> 00:10:28.462]  I said after they overthrow Trump with a fake race war and by surrounding the White House and by threatening members of Congress at their homes, give the military goes with them, next they're going to come to conservative leaders' houses and talk radio host houses and Fox News people houses.
[00:10:30.543 --> 00:10:35.306]  And that scared them so much because I was saying word for word what their real battle plans were.
[00:10:37.108 --> 00:10:44.493]  So the first clip I want to play is from a couple years ago from the video that got me finally banned off of Twitter.
[00:10:44.513 --> 00:10:46.195]  Remember, it was the last holdout.
[00:10:46.715 --> 00:10:48.136]  AJ predicts Civil War 2018.
[00:10:48.196 --> 00:10:48.657]  Here it is.
[00:10:56.308 --> 00:10:57.989]  They are taking over the U.S.
[00:10:58.089 --> 00:10:59.489]  They are creating the racial division.
[00:10:59.990 --> 00:11:01.590]  They are creating the sexual division.
[00:11:01.931 --> 00:11:08.293]  They are creating all of the admitted crises in this country in their own admissions in WikiLeaks.
[00:11:08.694 --> 00:11:12.736]  And they're horrified to see the economy coming back and all these good things happening.
[00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:19.639]  So they're going to throw their full force against America in an attempt to encircle Congress with a million people.
[00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:24.924]  And then to begin violent actions to run the patriots in D.C.
[00:11:25.104 --> 00:11:27.586]  out of the swamp so they can reestablish it.
[00:11:28.367 --> 00:11:30.129]  They believe that they're cornered.
[00:11:30.529 --> 00:11:32.071]  They know humanity's waking up.
[00:11:32.331 --> 00:11:40.259]  And so they're going to launch their full assault of violence and intimidation and terrorist attacks, I believe, in this country.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.242]  They've got all the Democratic Party talking heads saying,
[00:11:44.514 --> 00:11:47.356]  Attack Trump supporters, bully them, kick them out of restaurants.
[00:11:47.636 --> 00:12:06.189]  And when you see the weak-minded people they've got lined up to support them and to chant, they're all professors or government workers or little scared leftists that bought into the fact that they were on the winning team and they were the cool group and they ran everything and they were going to teach flyover country and Christians and veterans and everybody.
[00:12:07.654 --> 00:12:08.855]  They were the ruling class.
[00:12:08.975 --> 00:12:12.396]  These people don't believe in the dream of human empowerment.
[00:12:12.436 --> 00:12:16.277]  They believe in China and its enslavement of their own population.
[00:12:16.317 --> 00:12:17.898]  They believe in authoritarianism.
[00:12:17.938 --> 00:12:21.579]  They believe if they go kiss the ass of the globalists, they are in power.
[00:12:21.919 --> 00:12:22.640]  InfoWars.
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:23.900]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:24.640]  Today.
[00:12:25.881 --> 00:12:28.342]  So that really scared them because it was dead on.
[00:12:28.442 --> 00:12:29.962]  So here's CNN last night.
[00:12:30.002 --> 00:12:30.943]  It's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:32.219 --> 00:12:45.289]  Joe Biden made the pick that maximizes his chances of continuing to make the race a straight referendum on Trump, while also selecting someone whose resume suggests being ready to step in, even when Biden decides to step aside.
[00:12:45.309 --> 00:12:49.312]  And the article's up on InfoWars.com.
[00:12:49.412 --> 00:12:50.853]  He's always been a placeholder.
[00:12:51.713 --> 00:12:57.658]  They want someone who is weak so they can put in whoever they want later.
[00:12:59.175 --> 00:13:02.357]  That's why Nancy Pelosi says, I will contest the election one way or the other.
[00:13:02.597 --> 00:13:03.838]  He will be out of there.
[00:13:04.178 --> 00:13:08.621]  Even if he won't leave the White House, we will have our own inauguration and seat our president, Joe Biden.
[00:13:09.461 --> 00:13:11.963]  She said one way or another, we will contest it.
[00:13:12.423 --> 00:13:15.305]  We will have the states secede and we will put in Joe Biden.
[00:13:15.605 --> 00:13:18.127]  And I just played that clip probably 20 times saying, do you see this?
[00:13:18.387 --> 00:13:19.868]  And now we learned they war gamed it.
[00:13:20.128 --> 00:13:24.331]  The Democratic Party, John Podesta with the New York Times there officially.
[00:13:25.865 --> 00:13:27.205]  So they're not going to do this.
[00:13:27.245 --> 00:13:32.627]  They're already in process with the programming and the brainwashing and all of it right now.
[00:13:34.068 --> 00:13:36.149]  And that's why I tuned in to talk radio.
[00:13:36.169 --> 00:13:40.630]  And everybody's like, wow, Kamala Harris, everybody hates her.
[00:13:41.410 --> 00:13:42.851]  Trump's going to get in for sure now.
[00:13:42.911 --> 00:13:48.613]  And oh, the guy that predicted Trump would win, the statistician, the professor says he's even, you know, more of a winner now.
[00:13:48.693 --> 00:13:52.554]  And we've got all those graphs and the odds are even better for Trump now.
[00:13:52.734 --> 00:13:53.455]  Absolutely.
[00:13:53.495 --> 00:13:54.335]  It's a landslide.
[00:13:55.290 --> 00:14:06.858]  And if they can't get over that landslide with massive electronic voter fraud, election fraud, mail-in ballots, people voting the names of dead people, they are going to do the next best thing.
[00:14:07.498 --> 00:14:12.521]  And they're going to say, we won the popular vote in these blue states, they're going to massively pack the ballots with.
[00:14:13.362 --> 00:14:14.743]  You know they're going to get the popular vote.
[00:14:15.383 --> 00:14:18.565]  Even if there's a landslide, because they stuff the ballots in blue states.
[00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:21.747]  They're going to say, see you're illegitimate, we the people demand it!
[00:14:22.088 --> 00:14:23.569]  And then burn down the cities.
[00:14:24.682 --> 00:14:28.788]  Attack the stock market so they think the average American will roll over and go along with it.
[00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:32.673]  Meanwhile, I saw a Washington Post article.
[00:14:32.753 --> 00:14:33.754]  Trump was insane.
[00:14:34.115 --> 00:14:39.302]  They didn't send a mail-in ballot to a dead cat or a dead dog, and of course they did.
[00:14:41.135 --> 00:14:43.436]  They're just sending them to any name they can scrape to any address.
[00:14:43.917 --> 00:14:44.537]  This is it.
[00:14:44.677 --> 00:14:46.238]  The next 82 days.
[00:14:46.818 --> 00:14:47.979]  All the cards on the table.
[00:14:48.519 --> 00:14:50.220]  We're in the middle of a new world order lockdown.
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.201]  It's all a fraud.
[00:14:51.861 --> 00:14:53.102]  They're starting the race war.
[00:14:53.222 --> 00:14:58.866]  It's all coming to a head and that's why you're meant to stay indoors in the political season.
[00:14:58.926 --> 00:15:00.426]  Don't go to the Trump rallies.
[00:15:00.827 --> 00:15:02.908]  Don't go out with your sign supporting America.
[00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:07.611]  Don't go out and support your local government, which the globalists already control but are fully trying to overthrow.
[00:15:08.595 --> 00:15:11.420]  You just sit there in your house while they take over.
[00:15:12.061 --> 00:15:12.181]  No!
[00:15:13.479 --> 00:15:20.461]  Go to the stores, don't wear the mask, hand out flyers, educate people, march on the streets, go bullhorn the city councils.
[00:15:20.481 --> 00:15:36.105]  They've locked down all the governments so you can't have that speech, so you can't be seen, so they can gaslight everybody and tell you that, oh, the lockdown continues because of a bad strain of COVID and thousands dying a day, and Trump's been driven out because, you know, he tried to steal the election.
[00:15:36.625 --> 00:15:39.546]  That's why they put you in this otherworldly, bizarre atmosphere.
[00:15:40.126 --> 00:15:43.469]  Thinking you'll accept the new normal is abnormalcy and tyranny.
[00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:44.910]  But we're not going to let it happen.
[00:15:44.930 --> 00:15:45.670]  We're still on air.
[00:15:45.911 --> 00:15:46.911]  We're still fighting back.
[00:15:47.292 --> 00:15:49.493]  They may have censored everybody, including the President, off Twitter.
[00:15:50.014 --> 00:15:52.716]  But we're still here at Bandon Video and on local radio stations.
[00:15:53.016 --> 00:15:54.678]  So, use those outlets now.
[00:15:54.778 --> 00:15:56.879]  You are Paul Revere.
[00:15:57.099 --> 00:15:57.580]  82 days.
[00:15:58.921 --> 00:16:00.202]  82 days to destiny.
[00:16:00.902 --> 00:16:01.343]  Welcome back.
[00:16:01.363 --> 00:16:02.484]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:16:02.724 --> 00:16:03.084]  Okay.
[00:16:04.825 --> 00:16:08.849]  So, we've seen Moody's and Barron's and the big bond rating companies.
[00:16:09.738 --> 00:16:13.140]  Come out in the last few months and say the election will be contested.
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:19.783]  The Democrats say they will contest it because of the COVID lockdown and the things they're doing in blue states.
[00:16:20.524 --> 00:16:26.187]  And because they're violating all these state and federal laws, then Republicans are going to have to contest it.
[00:16:26.247 --> 00:16:29.328]  That's what the big rating agencies have properly said.
[00:16:31.049 --> 00:16:34.251]  Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan came out and said that we won't know for weeks.
[00:16:36.974 --> 00:16:40.997]  Trump says, wow, we might have to postpone it until you stop the illegal stuff.
[00:16:41.037 --> 00:16:43.138]  They go, oh no, you don't have the power to do that.
[00:16:43.198 --> 00:16:53.986]  We're going ahead and we're just going to say that we've won and secede and declare the popular vote and see what the military does.
[00:16:54.386 --> 00:16:57.249]  That's a quote from John Podesta, New York Times.
[00:16:58.349 --> 00:17:03.073]  And then they're wargaming and propagandizing and gallighting, preparing the ground
[00:17:04.477 --> 00:17:06.639]  Everywhere, like, this is their main push.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:10.403]  It was Russiagate, it was Ukraine, it was all, the Trumps are racist.
[00:17:10.824 --> 00:17:13.907]  Now they're moving to, he's a dictator, he won't leave.
[00:17:14.527 --> 00:17:23.136]  If he doesn't let us steal the election, if he challenges anything, well, then we're gonna burn down every government building in the country.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:27.601]  Well, now!
[00:17:29.295 --> 00:17:36.578]  The head of the Federal Elections Commission, Ellen Weintraub, has come out and said, substantial chance of just this happening.
[00:17:37.458 --> 00:17:39.999]  And the Democrats are like, you bet, we're contesting it.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:42.260]  We know there's a landslide.
[00:17:42.941 --> 00:17:44.681]  But again, we're allowed to contest.
[00:17:45.022 --> 00:17:46.842]  You can't contest our contesting.
[00:17:48.603 --> 00:17:49.664]  That's the pre-programming.
[00:17:49.684 --> 00:17:53.065]  What they say Trump is going to do, they're already doing.
[00:17:54.205 --> 00:17:55.706]  And again, I tune into talk radio.
[00:17:56.286 --> 00:17:57.547]  They have no idea.
[00:17:58.902 --> 00:18:00.103]  This is even going on.
[00:18:00.364 --> 00:18:03.106]  And I don't want to be the guy here warning everybody.
[00:18:03.367 --> 00:18:05.849]  I don't want to be the guy here right about all this first.
[00:18:06.730 --> 00:18:08.432]  I don't want to see the whole country sucker punch.
[00:18:08.452 --> 00:18:09.793]  This is so obvious.
[00:18:09.833 --> 00:18:19.363]  But see, for a mainline Republican to say they're going to try to secede and they're going to try to have a race war and that they're going to do that sounds too radical to people.
[00:18:19.783 --> 00:18:20.784]  Well, they are radical.
[00:18:21.405 --> 00:18:22.246]  It's what they're doing.
[00:18:25.819 --> 00:18:27.326]  And so it is what it is.
[00:18:28.090 --> 00:18:30.400]  So let's be adults about this and open the phones up.
[00:18:32.014 --> 00:18:34.395]  Starting next segment, I'll give the number out on this one issue.
[00:18:35.095 --> 00:18:36.015]  What do we do about this?
[00:18:36.075 --> 00:18:45.318]  Is we can celebrate how she's a terrible candidate and how 1% of Democrats liked her in polls and how she's a total flip-flopper and how she said outrageously criminal things.
[00:18:45.578 --> 00:18:48.359]  Now she hates Christians and wants to ban all the guns.
[00:18:48.919 --> 00:18:51.680]  And I could play those clips where she says, I agree with Beto O'Rourke.
[00:18:51.860 --> 00:18:53.160]  We're going to ban all semi-autos.
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.640]  I'm going to sign an executive order.
[00:18:54.821 --> 00:18:56.121]  We can show you quotes where she says,
[00:18:57.654 --> 00:19:01.657]  We're going to hunt down Trump supporters and make them all pay for ever electing Trump.
[00:19:01.697 --> 00:19:03.318]  That's another talking point for the Democrats.
[00:19:04.058 --> 00:19:07.661]  MSNBC CNN is, we're going to leave no stone unturned.
[00:19:07.681 --> 00:19:10.183]  We're going to burn down the populist movement that did this.
[00:19:12.124 --> 00:19:18.568]  What do you think they did shipping our jobs overseas and trying to brainwash our kids with pedophiles and trying to abort our children, trying to break up our families?
[00:19:20.130 --> 00:19:23.392]  This is what they're always up to, but now it's out in the open.
[00:19:25.461 --> 00:19:30.744]  And so we can look at all the fake laughing and the emptiness of these monsters and think she's easy to beat.
[00:19:32.406 --> 00:19:36.768]  They don't care if 80 plus percent of black voters hate her.
[00:19:37.048 --> 00:19:39.230]  They don't care if she polled at 1% with Democrats.
[00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.052]  They don't care if she was for minimum sentences for black people.
[00:19:42.312 --> 00:19:43.533]  They don't care.
[00:19:43.753 --> 00:19:44.773]  They don't care.
[00:19:45.034 --> 00:19:47.455]  Because they're going to contest the election.
[00:19:48.116 --> 00:19:49.617]  They're going to try to install her.
[00:19:49.757 --> 00:19:54.780]  And then Joe Biden will step aside within three months of being inaugurated.
[00:19:57.182 --> 00:20:02.046]  And then the whole sexual division between men and women and black and white, all of it will be perfect.
[00:20:02.246 --> 00:20:03.747]  She's the perfect wedge, Obama 2.0.
[00:20:03.787 --> 00:20:08.110]  And the Clintons and the Obamas are running the whole show.
[00:20:08.150 --> 00:20:12.673]  They're headlining at the DNC, these demonic child trafficking mummies.
[00:20:13.514 --> 00:20:14.935]  Oprah Winfrey's going to be there.
[00:20:16.156 --> 00:20:17.917]  All evidence points towards child trafficker.
[00:20:20.059 --> 00:20:22.601]  John of God running operations, Africa.
[00:20:23.894 --> 00:20:30.158]  Orphanages, little girls, Hillary and the missing kids in Haiti, AP investigation confirming, child trafficking by the thousands.
[00:20:30.619 --> 00:20:32.480]  I mean, these are stone-cold killers.
[00:20:33.521 --> 00:20:34.841]  They're already censoring everybody.
[00:20:35.042 --> 00:20:36.563]  They control most of the Justice Department.
[00:20:37.263 --> 00:20:39.285]  Everybody better understand, they're making their move.
[00:20:41.006 --> 00:20:44.708]  Because they know if Trump gets back in, it will be comeuppance.
[00:20:44.788 --> 00:20:45.669]  It will be vengeance.
[00:20:45.749 --> 00:20:47.530]  It will be their whole system dismantled.
[00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:50.052]  So they're cornered rats, and they're going to contest it.
[00:20:50.412 --> 00:20:52.033]  So what are we, the American people, going to do?
[00:20:52.093 --> 00:20:52.954]  What does Trump need to do?
[00:20:56.001 --> 00:21:02.110]  Hear from the head of the Federal Election Commission.
[00:21:03.072 --> 00:21:05.215]  Now when Trump says this, he's evil, but here she is saying it.
[00:21:06.741 --> 00:21:19.829]  Let me just tell everybody we're all going to need to take a deep breath and be patient this year because, you know, there's a substantial chance we are not going to know on election night what the results are.
[00:21:20.609 --> 00:21:25.612]  Possibly for the presidency, but maybe for many other races that are important to people.
[00:21:27.202 --> 00:21:28.363]  That's okay.
[00:21:28.503 --> 00:21:36.548]  If it takes a little bit longer to count all the votes accurately, that's what we need to do in order to ensure that everyone's vote counts.
[00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.929]  Oh!
[00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:41.351]  The bureaucracy's making its move.
[00:21:41.711 --> 00:21:43.152]  The big corporations are making their move.
[00:21:43.172 --> 00:21:45.174]  We've already seen the unified fraud with COVID.
[00:21:46.194 --> 00:21:48.135]  Using fake numbers of dead that died of other things.
[00:21:48.576 --> 00:21:50.257]  Saying 2.5 million would die when it's...
[00:21:52.463 --> 00:21:59.208]  160,000 lying with false positive tests, but the fine print says, oh, have you had a bacterial infection the last 10 years?
[00:21:59.249 --> 00:22:00.610]  Well, sorry, it says you have COVID.
[00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:01.991]  They don't care.
[00:22:02.211 --> 00:22:06.455]  They're making their move because they never get in trouble for what they've done.
[00:22:06.475 --> 00:22:14.501]  So people are like, oh, Kamala Harris says she'll sign an executive order and make everybody turn in all semi-automatic shotguns, handguns, and rifles.
[00:22:15.422 --> 00:22:16.563]  Why, she'll never get elected.
[00:22:17.083 --> 00:22:17.524]  Oh, really?
[00:22:19.138 --> 00:22:27.243]  They're going to contest the election, they're going to have the blue states secede, and then China and the globalists have won right there because it'll send the stock market down and break the country in two.
[00:22:27.403 --> 00:22:34.368]  Even if we're able to remove the Democrats and stop them and defeat them, they will still be destroying the nation in the process.
[00:22:35.529 --> 00:22:38.611]  And so what will the Justice Department and the Pentagon and all the good old boys do?
[00:22:39.171 --> 00:22:41.292]  They'll sit there and play golf and
[00:22:42.338 --> 00:22:50.741]  Try to act like they're on both sides and just hope it isn't too big a disaster because none of them will stick their head up above the grass.
[00:22:52.382 --> 00:22:59.325]  And because of that, we're now a laughingstock and a corrupt, weak system like the Soviet Union that doesn't even deserve Trump.
[00:23:01.066 --> 00:23:03.327]  And I'm not trying to be negative here.
[00:23:03.387 --> 00:23:06.488]  It's just that there's a normalcy bias with people
[00:23:07.506 --> 00:23:12.831]  That just think, oh, Kamala Harris, total fraud, polls at 1%, she's a joke.
[00:23:13.191 --> 00:23:15.793]  They're going to contest the election.
[00:23:17.114 --> 00:23:21.098]  They're going to then say that the states are seceding along the popular vote.
[00:23:21.558 --> 00:23:27.343]  They've said they're going to have their own inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris at some undisclosed location.
[00:23:27.563 --> 00:23:28.804]  I played Pelosi yesterday.
[00:23:29.004 --> 00:23:30.506]  They're not joking!
[00:23:31.447 --> 00:23:32.828]  They're not joking!
[00:23:35.413 --> 00:23:42.655]  And when they try to burn down federal courthouses and shoot police officers, if the police fight back, they'll be arrested, so the police are going to stand down.
[00:23:42.996 --> 00:23:45.997]  And if citizens go out and fight back, the news will say we're terrorists.
[00:23:47.317 --> 00:23:54.539]  Hollywood, the mainstream media, the whole culture, it's all globalist, hate America, all making its move now.
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.480]  It will blow up in their face.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:58.561]  It will be a disaster.
[00:23:58.601 --> 00:24:04.543]  It will trigger a bloody civil war that will be Alexander Soros and Jordan Soros' final countdown.
[00:24:06.013 --> 00:24:07.454]  And final, Waterloo.
[00:24:08.354 --> 00:24:11.155]  But, there's no reason to let this happen.
[00:24:11.636 --> 00:24:24.562]  If every person, it's extremely politically active, if every person listening tells people about this show, and this live feed, and these topics, and if we make other talk radio and Fox News cover this and make the President take it head on, they'll have to back down.
[00:24:24.602 --> 00:24:25.982]  And I know a blueprint to stop them.
[00:24:26.162 --> 00:24:27.143]  We'll cover it when we come back.
[00:24:29.028 --> 00:24:36.512]  I am quite a student of history because it's so addictive and so interesting and so informative and so empowering.
[00:24:38.993 --> 00:24:40.974]  I know what's going to happen in markets before they happen.
[00:24:40.994 --> 00:24:43.055]  I know what's going to happen in politics.
[00:24:43.915 --> 00:24:44.896]  I know how men operate.
[00:24:44.916 --> 00:24:45.896]  I know how women operate.
[00:24:45.916 --> 00:24:50.078]  Because when you study history, you learn how cycles unfold.
[00:24:50.919 --> 00:24:53.420]  It's been said history repeats, and it does, but it also rhymes.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:55.641]  We have a Republican.
[00:24:57.369 --> 00:24:58.970]  It was really seeking to unify the nation.
[00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:07.292]  And you have the very same Democratic Party saying they're going to secede if he is re-elected.
[00:25:08.933 --> 00:25:11.394]  Well, that's what happened with Lincoln when he was elected the first time.
[00:25:11.434 --> 00:25:12.574]  They just did not honor it.
[00:25:13.435 --> 00:25:15.635]  And again, I've studied the Civil War.
[00:25:16.016 --> 00:25:17.176]  Both sides were in the wrong.
[00:25:17.656 --> 00:25:19.597]  Andrew Jackson was right stopping the Civil War.
[00:25:19.997 --> 00:25:21.397]  It almost happened 30 years before.
[00:25:23.698 --> 00:25:24.939]  Sam Houston was against the war.
[00:25:25.219 --> 00:25:25.559]  He was the
[00:25:27.113 --> 00:25:33.615]  Governor of Texas and was literally thrown out of the building at gunpoint when he said, it's going to go on for years.
[00:25:33.635 --> 00:25:39.538]  It's going to kill our best men and we're going to lose because they got five times the men and they got all the factories.
[00:25:39.598 --> 00:25:43.179]  But British intelligence manipulated that the North was doing stuff that was wrong.
[00:25:43.199 --> 00:25:44.339]  The South was doing something that was wrong.
[00:25:44.379 --> 00:25:48.861]  But the point is, is that Lincoln was the Republican president.
[00:25:50.427 --> 00:25:54.449]  And the South didn't like him being elected, so they began secession.
[00:25:55.310 --> 00:26:07.217]  The very same Democratic Party, I'm getting chills, is now trying to create a racial crisis again, and is trying to have the blue states secede.
[00:26:09.335 --> 00:26:12.197]  And it's calling for the military to throw Trump out.
[00:26:12.257 --> 00:26:13.478]  Do you understand what I just said?
[00:26:13.998 --> 00:26:21.363]  And I know for the last week I've been saying the same thing because it'd be like if a giant meteorite was coming to blow the planet up.
[00:26:21.803 --> 00:26:24.205]  In six months I'd say let's get rockets up with nukes.
[00:26:24.525 --> 00:26:25.446]  Let's try to blow it up.
[00:26:27.059 --> 00:26:35.992]  I wouldn't be talking about how there's a forest fire five miles away, or how there was a car wreck down the street, or how, you know, my cousin has cancer, hypothetically.
[00:26:36.453 --> 00:26:39.638]  Because the big enchilada is that that asteroid's coming.
[00:26:42.557 --> 00:26:48.339]  The New York Times sat in on the meeting with the Clintons, the Obamas, the Democratic Party, and Podesta still running it.
[00:26:48.479 --> 00:26:49.920]  They're running the DNC.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.260]  They're the headliners again.
[00:26:52.061 --> 00:26:55.182]  For their platform for the UN and the contact tracers.
[00:26:55.202 --> 00:26:57.583]  They just graduated on to the world government level.
[00:26:58.183 --> 00:27:00.724]  And then Biden and Harris will be their placeholders here.
[00:27:01.824 --> 00:27:03.525]  America's a little cog in this thing.
[00:27:04.505 --> 00:27:05.046]  And their power.
[00:27:05.606 --> 00:27:06.946]  We're just slaves to be used.
[00:27:07.707 --> 00:27:10.468]  And they say, we will have the states to see.
[00:27:11.616 --> 00:27:13.097]  We will say the election is illegitimate.
[00:27:13.658 --> 00:27:15.179]  We will even hold our own inauguration.
[00:27:16.420 --> 00:27:20.403]  And we'll see who the military sides with when the cities burn.
[00:27:21.184 --> 00:27:22.985]  That's in the New York Times!
[00:27:23.565 --> 00:27:33.053]  A message to the military and the brass, everybody else, that, oh, the stock market went down 10,000 points since the contested election.
[00:27:33.073 --> 00:27:33.753]  That's what you'll be hearing.
[00:27:34.114 --> 00:27:36.896]  It'll go down another 10,000 if we don't turn it around.
[00:27:37.556 --> 00:27:38.497]  Trump's gotta go.
[00:27:38.577 --> 00:27:39.358]  It's his fault.
[00:27:39.738 --> 00:27:40.579]  We need unity.
[00:27:44.670 --> 00:27:46.391]  They're gonna hold this country hostage.
[00:27:48.233 --> 00:27:55.179]  They say they're going to hold the country hostage, and we're just sitting here flat-footed with our thumbs you know where.
[00:27:57.081 --> 00:28:04.547]  I am horrified that I watch Fox News, almost no mention of this, Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck.
[00:28:06.188 --> 00:28:09.591]  Please, please, please understand what's going on.
[00:28:09.932 --> 00:28:12.474]  Thank God Breitbart has the proper headline.
[00:28:14.761 --> 00:28:17.663]  Thank God some people are listening to this.
[00:28:17.943 --> 00:28:21.845]  I know the President gets it and he's like, well, I might not be around very much longer.
[00:28:21.865 --> 00:28:23.106]  You might not see me for a while.
[00:28:23.546 --> 00:28:24.987]  These criminals are coming after me.
[00:28:25.047 --> 00:28:25.367]  Yeah!
[00:28:26.468 --> 00:28:31.891]  Democrats' war game for election includes West Coast secession, possible civil war.
[00:28:32.831 --> 00:28:34.332]  It's not just West Coast secession.
[00:28:34.472 --> 00:28:38.415]  She said California, then led by blue states across the country.
[00:28:39.795 --> 00:28:43.858]  So we're watching bank robbers sit there and plan the damn thing in front of us.
[00:28:46.613 --> 00:28:48.975]  But they're going to rob us of our liberty, our freedom, our whole future.
[00:28:49.275 --> 00:28:53.819]  And then Kamala Harris, we've got to get these other clips because I saw her say this on MSNBC.
[00:28:55.174 --> 00:29:08.941]  I had the guys look and we've been able to find it, but here's the quote that reminded me, and I've seen a bunch of other Democratic Party operatives say this, you've all seen them say this, where we gotta, once we get rid of Trump, we gotta get his supporters and outlaw him and hunt him down and level him and destroy him and demolish him.
[00:29:09.001 --> 00:29:09.881]  I mean, these are the terms.
[00:29:10.622 --> 00:29:24.329]  And once Trump's gone, this is Kamala Harris, and once Trump's gone and we have regained our rightful place in the White House, look out if you supported him and endorsed his actions because we'll be coming for you next.
[00:29:25.216 --> 00:29:27.157]  He will feel the vengeance of a nation.
[00:29:27.618 --> 00:29:32.541]  No stone will be left unturned as we seek you out in every corner of this great nation.
[00:29:32.861 --> 00:29:34.622]  For it is you who have betrayed us.
[00:29:34.682 --> 00:29:35.523]  Kamala Harris.
[00:29:36.103 --> 00:29:36.964]  June 18th, 2020.
[00:29:40.706 --> 00:29:41.807]  And they'll call you a racist.
[00:29:41.827 --> 00:29:42.688]  They'll call you criminal.
[00:29:42.728 --> 00:29:44.869]  And they'll point a mob at your house to go burn it down.
[00:29:45.249 --> 00:29:47.371]  And if you shoot back, you'll be called a white supremacist.
[00:29:49.632 --> 00:29:50.733]  This is race-based.
[00:29:53.615 --> 00:29:59.238]  KKK 101 Democrat tactics but flipped onto white people and the Republican Party and the party of Lincoln.
[00:30:00.119 --> 00:30:01.379]  Because the public is so stupid.
[00:30:01.639 --> 00:30:06.862]  The public, again, the average person does not know you die without vitamin C or vitamin D3 or zinc.
[00:30:07.103 --> 00:30:14.727]  They literally, in the news, think it's a conspiracy theory and they go, the UN says you don't need that, says the head of YouTube, the CEO.
[00:30:15.147 --> 00:30:16.708]  The UN says you don't need zinc.
[00:30:20.036 --> 00:30:23.179]  I go back to that because it's like saying plants don't need water.
[00:30:24.221 --> 00:30:27.644]  It's like idiocracy where they're putting Gatorade on plants.
[00:30:27.664 --> 00:30:30.848]  He goes, you know, the plants are dying, I think, because you're putting Gatorade on them.
[00:30:34.072 --> 00:30:35.513]  I mean, that's mainstream news.
[00:30:35.533 --> 00:30:35.854]  Look at that.
[00:30:35.914 --> 00:30:39.598]  Town Hall, if you disagree with the WHO, we're pulling your content.
[00:30:40.828 --> 00:30:42.448]  We're under the UN.
[00:30:42.849 --> 00:30:43.689]  It's already here.
[00:30:44.489 --> 00:30:49.470]  They're burning down federal courthouses and attacking federal officers with hatchets.
[00:30:50.471 --> 00:31:02.174]  The federal officers are inside the building, they're hacking in, they come out, they hit them in the head with a hatchet, they try to kill us with hammers, and they go on the news and go, nobody's violent, we're nice people.
[00:31:03.976 --> 00:31:07.897]  Oh, and they're climbing on top of our truck with hammers, screaming, F-U, F-U, I'm gonna kill you!
[00:31:08.077 --> 00:31:08.997]  I'm gonna kill you!
[00:31:09.017 --> 00:31:10.018]  I'm gonna kill you!
[00:31:10.038 --> 00:31:11.198]  I'm gonna kill Alex!
[00:31:11.398 --> 00:31:12.618]  I'm gonna kill Owen!
[00:31:12.798 --> 00:31:13.598]  I'm gonna kill you!
[00:31:13.859 --> 00:31:15.059]  I'm a F-U pig!
[00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:15.859]  I'm gonna kill you!
[00:31:17.199 --> 00:31:19.540]  I mean, oh, such nice people.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:23.101]  And they beat up women and children.
[00:31:23.181 --> 00:31:27.282]  And new videos are out today of just people driving down the road and Antifa runs out.
[00:31:28.042 --> 00:31:30.843]  Turks screaming, Black Lives Matter and pointing guns at people.
[00:31:32.145 --> 00:31:35.647]  And the person tries to drive around him and they go, don't hit me and run in front of the car.
[00:31:36.888 --> 00:31:43.712]  And then you got black people breaking in stores in Chicago, grabbing jewelry, grabbing clothing, going, I can't breathe.
[00:31:43.892 --> 00:31:45.173]  Like, it's okay, I can't breathe.
[00:31:45.373 --> 00:31:49.216]  Long as I say I can't breathe, I can shove some more Louis Vuitton in this bag.
[00:31:49.536 --> 00:31:59.122]  I mean, we've been decadent, we've been evil, we've been broken down, we've been on welfare, and now it's produced scum, black scum, white scum, brown scum.
[00:32:01.385 --> 00:32:08.131]  Entitled scum with no empathy, no common sense, who believe that you're driving a big nice blue truck, you're white.
[00:32:08.831 --> 00:32:10.733]  I'm gonna jump in front of you and point a gun at you.
[00:32:11.434 --> 00:32:12.735]  Well, don't you try to back up!
[00:32:14.576 --> 00:32:15.857]  And they're like, don't run me over!
[00:32:16.058 --> 00:32:16.378]  Don't run!
[00:32:16.398 --> 00:32:19.040]  Then they yell, don't run me over while he's backing away.
[00:32:19.821 --> 00:32:21.302]  It's all this mental illness.
[00:32:21.642 --> 00:32:22.343]  It's like magic.
[00:32:22.623 --> 00:32:25.085]  You can rob a place if you just say, I can't breathe.
[00:32:25.386 --> 00:32:27.667]  You can shoot somebody if you just say, I can't breathe.
[00:32:28.513 --> 00:32:30.514]  You can block traffic if you just say, I can't breathe.
[00:32:30.814 --> 00:32:33.615]  Well, you blocked the wrong person to point a gun with them.
[00:32:33.835 --> 00:32:34.895]  You ain't gonna be breathing.
[00:32:37.957 --> 00:32:41.318]  So, I've got so much to cover here, but I'm just trying to explain to people.
[00:32:41.678 --> 00:32:43.059]  Trump's all, this is my pick.
[00:32:43.299 --> 00:32:44.359]  It's exactly who I want.
[00:32:44.619 --> 00:32:45.840]  It's the very worst choice.
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.480]  I love it.
[00:32:48.038 --> 00:32:49.379]  And politically, he's right.
[00:32:49.639 --> 00:32:50.620]  She's the worst choice.
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:51.540]  So is Biden.
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:57.003]  Because they want weak, stupid people that aren't respected, that they control.
[00:32:57.263 --> 00:32:58.724]  Harris is controlled.
[00:32:59.144 --> 00:33:00.425]  Biden is controlled.
[00:33:00.505 --> 00:33:05.028]  They will do exactly what Big Tech and the Chai comms tell them.
[00:33:05.348 --> 00:33:10.891]  Joe Biden's gone on TV and said, we need to have every aspect of our lives governed by the Chinese.
[00:33:10.911 --> 00:33:12.752]  I'm going to play the clip again.
[00:33:13.193 --> 00:33:17.115]  The Washington Post says, Xi Jinping must destroy Trump.
[00:33:18.737 --> 00:33:20.100]  And the average liberal reads that.
[00:33:20.441 --> 00:33:21.783]  I have people that work at this office.
[00:33:21.823 --> 00:33:22.505]  Some of them I've known 18 years.
[00:33:26.795 --> 00:33:27.636]  I know their families.
[00:33:28.456 --> 00:33:36.661]  One of them's sisters will not talk to him and literally, she's white, worships Xi Jinping and hopes he will crush America.
[00:33:36.921 --> 00:33:44.846]  The average leftist literally loves the dictator of China and a country that's killed 115 million of their own people.
[00:33:45.067 --> 00:33:46.127]  They are psychotic.
[00:33:46.387 --> 00:33:47.168]  They are nuts.
[00:33:47.568 --> 00:33:48.529]  They are crazy.
[00:33:48.809 --> 00:33:55.233]  They are in power and they're backed by Jeff Bezos and all these billionaires and they're making their move now!
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.844]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:34:05.067 --> 00:34:05.568]  Think about it.
[00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:23.164]  You have lived to see a large portion of the public and government and corporations openly side with Communist China against the United States and call for Xi Jinping to, quote, destroy our president.
[00:34:24.548 --> 00:34:30.814]  And you've seen tens of millions of citizens side with foreign powers against the existence of their very country.
[00:34:34.617 --> 00:34:35.158]  It's incredible.
[00:34:36.679 --> 00:34:37.320]  They're globalists.
[00:34:39.362 --> 00:34:41.884]  They believe they're conquering us, but the average person siding with it isn't.
[00:34:42.224 --> 00:34:48.450]  Here's Joe Biden just a few years ago saying China should guide us and influence us through every aspect of our lives.
[00:34:48.570 --> 00:34:49.111]  Well, they already do.
[00:34:49.151 --> 00:34:49.811]  They own Hollywood.
[00:34:49.851 --> 00:34:50.132]  Here it is.
[00:34:52.130 --> 00:35:03.759]  I'm also proud that more than 160 Fortune 500 companies are operating in Chengdu high-tech zone, including pioneer American businesses like Intel, Dell, and Oracle.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:09.903]  The US-China relationship has also improved dramatically in the past 30 years.
[00:35:11.044 --> 00:35:19.811]  In order to cement this robust partnership, we have to go beyond close ties between Washington and Beijing, which we're working on every day.
[00:35:21.291 --> 00:35:23.611]  Go beyond it to include all levels of government.
[00:35:24.332 --> 00:35:29.093]  Go beyond it to include classrooms and laboratories, athletic fields and boardrooms.
[00:35:31.633 --> 00:35:38.594]  That's why we launched our 100,000 strong initiative to boost the number of American students studying in China each year.
[00:35:40.535 --> 00:35:41.875]  Under the Communist Chinese Party.
[00:35:43.175 --> 00:35:46.776]  Another bellwether sign of the establishment being very, very long in the tooth.
[00:35:47.216 --> 00:35:50.157]  Senator Redstone, billionaire, media tycoon, dead at age 97.
[00:35:52.665 --> 00:35:58.607]  Extremely evil individual who let Nickelodeon promote pedophilia, you name it.
[00:35:59.768 --> 00:36:00.268]  Tough though.
[00:36:00.608 --> 00:36:04.610]  He was in a burning building once and held on for several hours by his hands that almost burned off.
[00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:09.472]  Spent the last years of his life fighting with his family over tens of billions of dollars.
[00:36:11.512 --> 00:36:14.153]  Built a media empire and long reigned over it.
[00:36:14.333 --> 00:36:15.314]  Yeah, his dad owned
[00:36:16.479 --> 00:36:17.099]  Let's look at the facts.
[00:36:46.616 --> 00:36:54.763]  One in four police officers who was killed in the line of duty by gunfire is killed by assault.
[00:36:56.885 --> 00:37:05.092]  Let's look at the fact that there are four million assault weapons in the United States, which were imported here from foreign countries.
[00:37:06.393 --> 00:37:13.719]  So I am also prepared, and I'm announcing it for the first time today here with you, to take executive action
[00:37:14.501 --> 00:37:17.642]  To ban the import of assault weapons into our country.
[00:37:20.183 --> 00:37:23.724]  And she also said, she was about to go to O'Rourke to ban semi-autos.
[00:37:24.004 --> 00:37:32.346]  There's a whole bunch of these clips, but remember they just had a frontline piece two weeks against me, two weeks ago on PBS saying, Jones is crazy, no one wants executive action against your guns.
[00:37:32.987 --> 00:37:35.807]  So they gaslight you, they tell you they're going to do all this, but then oh we're not doing it.
[00:37:36.368 --> 00:37:37.308]  Here she is during the debates.
[00:37:38.991 --> 00:37:52.617]  Because there are people in Washington DC, supposed leaders, who have failed to have the courage to reject a false choice which suggests you're either in favor of the Second Amendment or you want to take everyone's guns away.
[00:37:53.257 --> 00:37:55.138]  Supposed leaders in Washington DC
[00:37:55.618 --> 00:38:00.540]  Who have failed to have the courage to recognize, you know what, you want to go hunting?
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:01.260]  That's fine.
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:08.643]  But we need reasonable gun safety laws in this country starting with universal background checks and a renewal of the assault weapon ban.
[00:38:08.983 --> 00:38:11.924]  But they have failed to have the courage to act.
[00:38:11.984 --> 00:38:13.785]  So Ben, here's my response to you.
[00:38:14.305 --> 00:38:15.406]  Upon being elected,
[00:38:16.446 --> 00:38:23.652]  I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws.
[00:38:23.712 --> 00:38:27.275]  And if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action.
[00:38:28.055 --> 00:38:39.585]  And specifically what I will do is put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year, they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns.
[00:38:40.555 --> 00:38:47.819]  I will require that for any gun dealer that breaks the law, the ATF take their license.
[00:38:47.879 --> 00:38:50.600]  And by the way, ATF, Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms.
[00:38:50.961 --> 00:38:55.523]  Well the ATF has been doing a lot of the A and the T but not much of the F. And we need to fix that.
[00:38:56.343 --> 00:39:01.166]  And then... Oh yeah, they want to disarm us so bad they can taste it.
[00:39:01.206 --> 00:39:06.148]  There's a bunch of other clips where she says she agrees with Beto O'Rourke and in her official stance wants to ban all semi-autos.
[00:39:06.168 --> 00:39:08.610]  We'll play more of those clips coming up next hour.
[00:39:10.538 --> 00:39:21.064]  No, she said when she's president, but she polled at 1% throughout those primaries, but the 1%, the establishment, they sure liked what they heard.
[00:39:21.884 --> 00:39:30.129]  So remember, she's coming after you and your family and CNN reports that she's ready to step in when Biden decides to step aside.
[00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:35.012]  That's been the plan all along.
[00:39:36.633 --> 00:39:37.093]  And we've got.
[00:39:38.894 --> 00:39:40.255]  Alexander Soros coming out.
[00:39:41.135 --> 00:39:43.176]  Very, very, very excited.
[00:39:43.216 --> 00:39:47.478]  Tweeting today that he can't wait until she's the president.
[00:39:48.078 --> 00:39:49.059]  Because that's what this is.
[00:39:49.099 --> 00:39:50.959]  How do you put somebody super unpopular in?
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:56.442]  Alexander Soros is the main funder of Antifa on record.
[00:39:57.402 --> 00:39:58.283]  A little general.
[00:39:59.243 --> 00:40:00.364]  A little general that could.
[00:40:02.204 --> 00:40:05.426]  Who believes the country should not exist at all.
[00:40:07.898 --> 00:40:10.920]  The article's up on Infowars.com if you want to see it.
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:14.021]  But before we go to break, I want to give the number out.
[00:40:14.062 --> 00:40:24.768]  I want to open the phones up in the next hour, specifically on the Democrats' announcement that they want to contest the election, have the blue states secede, and then have their own inauguration, and have the military take Trump out.
[00:40:24.788 --> 00:40:25.928]  You go, that's wishful thinking.
[00:40:26.449 --> 00:40:30.171]  Well, they got defeated with the previous coups, but this one is.
[00:40:31.187 --> 00:40:33.830]  A hundred times more dangerous than out in the open, and they're going for broke.
[00:40:34.130 --> 00:40:38.654]  So we're just gonna let them break the country apart and burn everything down, and then they'll try something else.
[00:40:38.674 --> 00:40:40.075]  They just never get in trouble.
[00:40:40.115 --> 00:40:40.976]  It's all illegal.
[00:40:41.657 --> 00:40:42.818]  And they're in bed with China.
[00:40:42.858 --> 00:40:43.819]  They're foreign enemies.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:45.741]  They're collaborators.
[00:40:47.062 --> 00:40:49.303]  Against the existence of the nation.
[00:40:49.323 --> 00:40:49.603]  877-789-2539.
[00:40:51.104 --> 00:40:59.709]  First-time callers, if you called in and didn't get through, you're on hold, we'll go to the front of the line.
[00:40:59.729 --> 00:41:00.149]  877-789-2539.
[00:41:00.169 --> 00:41:00.389]  877-789-2539.
[00:41:00.629 --> 00:41:01.990]  On this one subject.
[00:41:02.430 --> 00:41:07.333]  The election, how they're going to contest it, their plan to secede, their wargaming, what does Trump do?
[00:41:07.633 --> 00:41:08.693]  I'll tell you what I think he needs to do.
[00:41:08.993 --> 00:41:09.754]  Coming up next hour.
[00:41:11.757 --> 00:41:19.900]  877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539, and we will get you up and on the air in the next hour.
[00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:21.480]  We have a special guest.
[00:41:21.500 --> 00:41:22.400]  We'll tell you about it a little bit later.
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:37.285]  And don't forget, tomorrow night, I'm going to be live with a whole bunch of special guests from 7 to 10 p.m., commercial-free, on the radio and TV satellites, if stations want to carry it, and the streams at BandOnVideo, InfoWars.com forward slash show, and NewsWars.com forward slash show.
[00:41:38.683 --> 00:41:40.584]  And again, I keep telling you, it's paramount.
[00:41:40.624 --> 00:41:44.045]  People ask, how are you taking it being totally censored two years ago off the internet?
[00:41:44.085 --> 00:41:45.906]  I said, we already built our own infrastructure when it was coming.
[00:41:46.626 --> 00:41:47.127]  And you're next.
[00:41:47.167 --> 00:41:48.587]  Well, now the president's being censored.
[00:41:49.908 --> 00:41:51.369]  Don't just complain about the censorship.
[00:41:51.449 --> 00:41:58.332]  Tell people about the live feed at newswars.com forward slash show or band dot video in the Alex Jones section on live feed or the other live shows.
[00:41:58.672 --> 00:41:59.032]  Share it.
[00:42:00.438 --> 00:42:05.042]  Most of the time you won't get censored on Twitter or Facebook, you know, Google, because they're just too brain dead.
[00:42:05.062 --> 00:42:07.304]  Especially if you use a NewsWorks link or a Bandai video link.
[00:42:08.165 --> 00:42:09.226]  Share it via text message.
[00:42:09.286 --> 00:42:10.547]  Share it via your email.
[00:42:10.627 --> 00:42:11.288]  Word of mouth.
[00:42:11.368 --> 00:42:12.189]  That's king!
[00:42:13.009 --> 00:42:16.532]  And know this, we are ending the big mega sale we had.
[00:42:17.173 --> 00:42:20.456]  We extended it, but had to get rid of free shipping because we're not bringing the revenue we need.
[00:42:20.876 --> 00:42:23.559]  It's great deals on our high quality supplements that are selling out.
[00:42:24.704 --> 00:42:25.966]  So we've got to stop on the bodies.
[00:42:26.006 --> 00:42:27.268]  Ultimate Turmeric at 50% off.
[00:42:27.528 --> 00:42:28.850]  Double Patriot points this Sunday.

[00:42:30.553 --> 00:42:31.714]  So good to flush yourself out.
[00:42:31.774 --> 00:42:32.996]  Next level probiotic.
[00:42:33.297 --> 00:42:33.857]  Just next level.
[00:42:35.269 --> 00:42:39.071]  50% off VasoBeats, 50% off Selling Out, TurboForce, 10-hour clean energy, 50% off.
[00:42:39.451 --> 00:42:40.831]  VitaMineralFuse, 50% off.
[00:42:41.431 --> 00:42:42.832]  RainForcePlus, 50% off.
[00:42:42.872 --> 00:42:45.753]  SurvivalShieldX, 2-day cyanide spray, 50% off.
[00:42:45.953 --> 00:42:47.234]  X3, 50% off.
[00:42:47.574 --> 00:42:48.874]  LungCleansePlus, 50% off.
[00:42:49.214 --> 00:42:50.235]  Ultra12, 50% off.
[00:42:50.295 --> 00:42:54.196]  DNAForcePlus, that is the most important one right there, 50% off.
[00:42:54.957 --> 00:42:59.678]  WinterSun, the booster immune system, D3 and K, taking it under the tongue, highest quality, 50% off.
[00:42:59.998 --> 00:43:01.139]  ChillForce, it goes on and on.
[00:43:02.233 --> 00:43:03.914]  Your purchase funds this operation.
[00:43:03.934 --> 00:43:05.636]  Without you, we will not be here.
[00:43:05.676 --> 00:43:15.284]  We also have to end sometime next week, as they're getting low, the Alexa Pure Breeze four-stage ion filter that they sell to us at their cost.
[00:43:15.905 --> 00:43:18.967]  We tack like $35 on to it to fund ourselves.
[00:43:19.648 --> 00:43:22.350]  Other filters on average are $400 that are comparable.
[00:43:22.571 --> 00:43:23.351]  They're a great deal at $250.
[00:43:24.977 --> 00:43:31.247]  They're selling them to us with a $35 profit in it because they're ordering a whole bunch more for the winner.
[00:43:31.627 --> 00:43:36.695]  They wanted to have a guaranteed amount of this order, so they dump these on the market through us because they're total fans.
[00:43:37.015 --> 00:43:37.777]  The same folks that own...
[00:43:39.008 --> 00:43:42.171]  My Patriot, and we're their biggest seller, and then they just do us favors.
[00:43:42.211 --> 00:43:43.712]  Nobody else gets them at anywhere this price.
[00:43:43.732 --> 00:43:46.434]  You'll find them at $250, sold all over, $200 when they're on discount.
[00:43:46.934 --> 00:43:51.498]  It's 137 smackers right now, and I put them in every room of my house.
[00:43:52.399 --> 00:43:56.822]  Two or three of them will do a small house, five or six do a big house, but I just absolutely love them.
[00:43:57.102 --> 00:44:00.745]  You just change out one filter, wash it off like once a month, put it back in.
[00:44:00.765 --> 00:44:02.266]  The other filters don't have to be replaced.
[00:44:02.887 --> 00:44:04.108]  Infowarsstore.com.
[00:44:04.128 --> 00:44:04.568]  Stay with us.
[00:44:04.588 --> 00:44:05.309]  Second hour coming up.
[00:44:06.857 --> 00:44:09.638]  Coming up next segment, I'm going right to your phone calls.
[00:44:09.739 --> 00:44:13.220]  What does Trump do when the Democrats announce a plan for secession?
[00:44:14.181 --> 00:44:17.423]  We're live, raw, and uncensored.
[00:44:21.765 --> 00:44:24.026]  That's right, and we are live, raw, and uncensored.
[00:44:25.007 --> 00:44:28.208]  The full Tucker Carlson 10-and-a-half-minute analysis is excellent.
[00:44:28.669 --> 00:44:32.891]  It's on InfoWars.com, but here's just some of it, and we're going to go to break and come back with your calls.
[00:44:33.982 --> 00:44:36.944]  ...single most transactional human being in America.
[00:44:37.004 --> 00:44:40.747]  There are timeshare salesmen you would trust more than Kamala Harris.
[00:44:41.107 --> 00:44:43.909]  You could find payday lenders who are more sincere.
[00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:54.277]  So it seemed inconceivable that given his current state, Joe Biden would choose someone so transparently one-dimensional as Kamala Harris, someone as empty as he is.
[00:44:54.918 --> 00:45:00.402]  It would be the first entirely hollow presidential ticket in American history, and we thought it could never happen.
[00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.971]  But it is.
[00:45:02.011 --> 00:45:03.152]  They're doing it anyway.
[00:45:03.493 --> 00:45:04.434]  Biden-Harris.
[00:45:04.474 --> 00:45:05.456]  That's what they're going with.
[00:45:06.117 --> 00:45:09.361]  And the choice tells you a lot about the current state of the Democratic Party.
[00:45:09.982 --> 00:45:16.351]  America is still technically a democracy, yet neither Biden nor Harris has ever been popular with actual voters.
[00:45:16.892 --> 00:45:18.933]  This is Joe Biden's third run for president.
[00:45:18.973 --> 00:45:21.794]  The first two attempts ended in embarrassing disasters.
[00:45:22.174 --> 00:45:24.955]  The third was headed at high speed in that direction.
[00:45:25.516 --> 00:45:31.978]  And then a series of unforeseen flukes in a highly crowded primary field left Biden the last man in the race.
[00:45:32.519 --> 00:45:34.619]  He was clearly shocked by his own victory.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:42.863]  On election night, the night he clinched the nomination in March, Biden was so rattled he mistook his sister for his wife during the acceptance speech.
[00:45:44.045 --> 00:45:48.966]  At the time, Joe Biden's relative unpopularity seemed like a major problem for Democrats.
[00:45:49.326 --> 00:45:50.487]  This is politics, after all.
[00:45:50.507 --> 00:45:54.708]  The people who tend to have the most support tend to win.
[00:45:55.448 --> 00:46:04.570]  So if you're choosing a presidential nominee, you'd think you'd want someone with a built-in constituency, a base of passionate voters you could count on on Election Day.
[00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:09.696]  But as it turns out, that is the last thing the leaders of the modern Democratic Party wanted.
[00:46:09.996 --> 00:46:11.718]  They already had a candidate like that, in fact.
[00:46:11.759 --> 00:46:12.880]  His name was Bernie Sanders.
[00:46:13.260 --> 00:46:15.363]  And they did everything they could to stop him.
[00:46:16.184 --> 00:46:16.384]  No.
[00:46:16.965 --> 00:46:22.248]  What they wanted instead was someone they could control, and Joe Biden fit that description perfectly.
[00:46:22.768 --> 00:46:26.091]  Biden was eager, malleable, and totally blank.
[00:46:26.511 --> 00:46:29.333]  He was willing to be whatever his handlers wanted him to be.
[00:46:30.013 --> 00:46:32.835]  Kamala Harris will be every bit as eager, and that's the point.
[00:46:33.616 --> 00:46:38.179]  If Biden-Harris still doesn't make sense to you as a ticket, it's only because you're not cynical enough.
[00:46:39.292 --> 00:46:41.293]  Harris clearly wasn't picked for her personal charm.
[00:46:41.693 --> 00:46:44.315]  More than 30 years ago, she dated a man called Willie Brown.
[00:46:44.355 --> 00:46:45.916]  He was later the mayor of San Francisco.
[00:46:46.336 --> 00:46:47.877]  She was 29 years old at the time.
[00:46:47.917 --> 00:46:49.478]  Brown was 60 and still married.
[00:46:50.039 --> 00:46:51.920]  Brown launched Harris' political career.
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:52.820]  He knows her very well.
[00:46:53.381 --> 00:46:57.944]  Last week, Brown publicly urged Joe Biden not to pick Kamala Harris as his running mate.
[00:46:58.604 --> 00:47:02.128]  But it turns out Willie Brown's opinion no longer matters in the Democratic Party.
[00:47:02.468 --> 00:47:04.651]  Jeff Bezos's opinion matters.
[00:47:04.791 --> 00:47:09.716]  So do the opinions of his fellow Bay Area tech titans and the finance moguls in New York.
[00:47:10.177 --> 00:47:12.940]  These are the people who bankroll the Democratic Party.
[00:47:13.240 --> 00:47:17.465]  They're the economic engine of the left and they love Kamala Harris.
[00:47:17.485 --> 00:47:19.307]  Not personally, it's business.
[00:47:19.767 --> 00:47:23.709]  Their main interest is in keeping the government carve-outs that have made them rich.
[00:47:24.109 --> 00:47:27.691]  They know the last thing Kamala Harris will do is threaten any of those.
[00:47:27.891 --> 00:47:28.191]  Never.
[00:47:28.711 --> 00:47:30.092]  Under any circumstances.
[00:47:30.772 --> 00:47:38.136]  One thing you can be certain of, in a Biden-Harris administration, private equity barons will still pay half the tax rate you pay.
[00:47:38.416 --> 00:47:39.477]  And that's the real point.
[00:47:40.577 --> 00:47:43.299]  Voters may not like Kamala Harris, but Wall Street does.
[00:47:43.539 --> 00:47:45.880]  Just in case you're wondering who is actually in charge.
[00:47:46.792 --> 00:47:51.976]  And yet still, even politicians have souls, technically anyway.
[00:47:52.537 --> 00:47:57.521]  So how could Joe Biden pick a running mate who once publicly denounced him as a racist?
[00:47:58.241 --> 00:47:58.902]  You remember the moment.
[00:47:58.942 --> 00:47:59.983]  It was at a debate last summer.
[00:48:01.203 --> 00:48:03.425]  I'm going to now direct this advice, President Biden.
[00:48:05.047 --> 00:48:10.431]  I do not believe you are a racist, but you also work with them to oppose busing.
[00:48:11.926 --> 00:48:19.220]  And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools.
[00:48:19.741 --> 00:48:21.965]  And she was bused to school every day.
[00:48:22.967 --> 00:48:23.929]  And that little girl was me.
[00:48:25.689 --> 00:48:27.610]  I do not believe you are racist.
[00:48:27.691 --> 00:48:29.592]  I do not believe you beat your wife.
[00:48:30.112 --> 00:48:30.312]  Right.
[00:48:30.553 --> 00:48:32.274]  Kamala Harris, civil rights icon.
[00:48:32.694 --> 00:48:34.435]  Actually, Harris grew up mostly in Canada.
[00:48:34.896 --> 00:48:38.819]  And in any case, forced busing was a disaster from the beginning to the end.
[00:48:39.239 --> 00:48:41.541]  Nobody liked it, including black families.
[00:48:42.121 --> 00:48:45.424]  Joe Biden may be a bigot, but it's not because he opposed forced busing.
[00:48:46.184 --> 00:48:48.545]  But apparently he's forgiven Harris for that slur.
[00:48:48.585 --> 00:48:49.785]  Maybe he doesn't even remember it.
[00:48:50.585 --> 00:48:57.427]  But even a dimming 77-year-old must have some memory of what Harris once said about his purported sex crimes.
[00:48:57.967 --> 00:48:58.507]  We'll be back.
[00:48:58.527 --> 00:48:58.807]  Stay with us.
[00:48:58.827 --> 00:49:01.628]  Just last year, several women came forward to say Joe Biden had touched them.
[00:49:02.568 --> 00:49:04.269]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:49:04.289 --> 00:49:06.710]  We're into the second hour of the transmission.
[00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:07.690]  Thank you for tuning in.
[00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:08.590]  Thank you for spreading the word.
[00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:10.011]  That's how we're going to win this war.
[00:49:10.031 --> 00:49:14.632]  That's why Big Tech's trying to censor not just us, but you and the president, everybody else that wants to be free.
[00:49:15.575 --> 00:49:30.552]  That a group of out-of-control tyrants who never are held responsible for anything they get caught doing, not the attempted coup against the president, not the attempted coup against the election, and the American people, not all the coups they run around the world.
[00:49:32.654 --> 00:49:36.739]  They believe they are invincible because they control the corporate media and the central banks, but
[00:49:38.203 --> 00:49:43.765]  Despite all their fraud, all the different top analysts are projecting that Trump is going to win in a landslide.
[00:49:44.125 --> 00:49:50.508]  And so the Democrats began preparing the ground the last few months saying, if he contested, we're going to have the military overthrowing.
[00:49:51.548 --> 00:49:56.470]  And now they've been very, very specific with all of us.
[00:49:58.270 --> 00:49:59.471]  They've been extremely specific.
[00:50:00.591 --> 00:50:02.292]  They've told us exactly what they're going to do.
[00:50:02.332 --> 00:50:04.913]  And I think that's a pretty big deal, don't you?
[00:50:04.933 --> 00:50:07.714]  You know, the president says Kamala Harris is who he would have picked.
[00:50:08.697 --> 00:50:09.678]  Because she is so weak.
[00:50:09.698 --> 00:50:15.666]  But see, that's if you're trying to win the election, not if you're trying to contest it and tear the country apart.
[00:50:16.987 --> 00:50:27.180]  So here is the president saying that he likes Harris and that Harris would have been his choice.
[00:50:29.083 --> 00:50:29.384]  Thank you.
[00:50:29.424 --> 00:50:30.124]  Thank you, President Trump.
[00:50:30.204 --> 00:50:36.510]  If I could have two questions, I'd like to ask you one about Senator Harris's record and then a different one about FISA abuse.
[00:50:36.550 --> 00:50:37.671]  Sure.
[00:50:37.711 --> 00:50:42.916]  So regarding Senator Harris's record, you had a pretty quick response to that.
[00:50:42.936 --> 00:50:44.638]  You had an ad out that said that she was a phony.
[00:50:44.698 --> 00:50:47.080]  And I wanted to drill down... That she was a what?
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:47.240]  A phony.
[00:50:47.301 --> 00:50:48.682]  A phony.
[00:50:49.434 --> 00:50:54.436]  And I wanted to ask about a specific example that a lot of people thought was a phony moment.
[00:50:54.556 --> 00:51:00.959]  As San Francisco D.A., she oversaw, according to the Mercury News, 1,900 marijuana convictions.
[00:51:01.420 --> 00:51:14.586]  But she was asked in an interview last year if she had smoked marijuana, and she appeared to joke and, according to some people, lie and say that she was listening to Snoop Dogg and Tupac while their music hadn't come out at the time, while she said she was smoking pot and listening to it.
[00:51:15.386 --> 00:51:16.587]  Why would she lie about that?
[00:51:16.607 --> 00:51:19.948]  Do you see that as more evidence that it surpassed a marijuana liability?
[00:51:21.288 --> 00:51:22.049]  Well, she lied.
[00:51:22.129 --> 00:51:24.510]  I mean, she said things that were untrue.
[00:51:26.130 --> 00:51:33.073]  She is a person that's told many, many stories that weren't true.
[00:51:33.193 --> 00:51:35.214]  She's very big into raising taxes.
[00:51:35.914 --> 00:51:40.696]  She wants to slash funds for our military at a level that nobody can even believe.
[00:51:41.876 --> 00:51:44.097]  She is against fracking.
[00:51:44.417 --> 00:51:48.498]  Fracking is... She's against petroleum products.
[00:51:48.698 --> 00:51:55.920]  I mean, how do you do that and go into Pennsylvania or Ohio or Oklahoma or the great state of Texas?
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.060]  She's against fracking.
[00:51:58.461 --> 00:51:59.501]  Fracking's a big deal.
[00:52:01.041 --> 00:52:03.242]  She's in favor of socialized medicine.
[00:52:03.942 --> 00:52:07.105]  Well, you're going to lose your doctors, you're going to lose your plan.
[00:52:07.145 --> 00:52:14.931]  She wants to take your health care plans away from 180 million Americans.
[00:52:14.971 --> 00:52:21.356]  180 million Americans that are very happy with their health insurance, and she wants to take that away.
[00:52:22.477 --> 00:52:23.898]  So she was my number one pick.
[00:52:24.098 --> 00:52:30.384]  I mean, she was, as they would say, because hopefully you'll start college football, she was my number one draft pick.
[00:52:32.685 --> 00:52:40.948]  So yes, she would be the number one weakest person, pulled at 1% throughout the entire primary process, even though the establishment was behind her.
[00:52:40.988 --> 00:52:42.268]  She went over like a lead balloon.
[00:52:42.748 --> 00:52:46.589]  People asked me back at the time, who do I think will win the nomination?
[00:52:46.709 --> 00:52:49.090]  I thought Kamala Harris, because that's who they wanted.
[00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:51.550]  And Joe Biden was faltering so bad.
[00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:53.591]  Then you said, oh, we'll use Joe as a placeholder.
[00:52:54.929 --> 00:52:55.910]  She's getting too much heat.
[00:52:55.950 --> 00:52:56.851]  She's too unpopular.
[00:52:57.351 --> 00:52:59.072]  We'll hold her back and then insert her.
[00:52:59.413 --> 00:53:05.838]  They were thinking about Hillary, but Hillary and Bill are running the UN, the contact tracing, all this globalist stuff.
[00:53:05.858 --> 00:53:09.841]  They're sitting back now as the puppet masters, still in control of Obama.
[00:53:09.941 --> 00:53:15.946]  And so they're just putting these two weak individuals in there, they believe, for control.
[00:53:15.986 --> 00:53:19.169]  But if they'd asked me the question, when does she flip-flop?
[00:53:19.209 --> 00:53:20.290]  When does she tell different stories?
[00:53:21.111 --> 00:53:22.171]  She said she believes.
[00:53:23.069 --> 00:53:29.711]  The accusers of Biden, that he sexually assaulted them, and that Biden needed to step down, that he shouldn't run.
[00:53:30.331 --> 00:53:32.271]  But now she loves Biden and doesn't believe them.
[00:53:32.451 --> 00:53:34.992]  I mean, boom, boom, boom!
[00:53:35.132 --> 00:53:36.112]  That's the big one.
[00:53:36.573 --> 00:53:37.713]  Let's play a clip of her saying it.
[00:53:37.733 --> 00:53:38.073]  Here it is.
[00:53:38.093 --> 00:53:45.595]  I believe them and I respect them being able to tell their story and having the courage to do it.
[00:53:46.636 --> 00:53:49.059]  Do you believe that the Vice President should enter this race?
[00:53:49.940 --> 00:53:52.023]  Oh, he's going to have to make that decision for himself.
[00:53:52.123 --> 00:53:53.405]  I wouldn't tell him what to do.
[00:53:55.287 --> 00:53:58.351]  Okay, so there you go, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:53:58.371 --> 00:54:00.034]  I want to start going to your calls right now.
[00:54:00.054 --> 00:54:04.640]  If you look at this as her as a challenger to Trump.
[00:54:05.981 --> 00:54:06.681]  You think she's weak?
[00:54:07.402 --> 00:54:07.862]  Think again.
[00:54:08.042 --> 00:54:14.726]  She's part black, so they can then say when she contests the election, if you contest that, you're being mean to a black woman.
[00:54:15.187 --> 00:54:15.967]  She's above reproach.
[00:54:15.987 --> 00:54:18.909]  The media is already saying you can't criticize her or you're a racist.
[00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:24.252]  Most people will bow down and roll over on their backs and show their yellow bellies.
[00:54:25.693 --> 00:54:26.694]  And that's just how this works.
[00:54:26.874 --> 00:54:29.916]  And then when they contest, they can trigger the riots nationwide.
[00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:33.972]  And then they have their placeholder if Trump is removed.
[00:54:34.052 --> 00:54:41.375]  And the Democrats say, we intend to put the country into such a crisis that the military and the establishment will act to remove Trump to save themselves.
[00:54:42.436 --> 00:54:47.979]  So we have this criminal group of crazy people on the CHICOM payroll making a run at all of us.
[00:54:49.159 --> 00:54:53.922]  Tyson, Robert, Dylan, Jacob, Tom, Matthew, Trey, Chris, Snaps, Robert.
[00:54:53.942 --> 00:54:54.802]  We're going to all of you.
[00:54:55.242 --> 00:54:56.583]  Trey from Georgia.
[00:54:57.043 --> 00:54:57.884]  Trey, you're up first.
[00:54:57.924 --> 00:54:58.164]  Thank you.
[00:54:59.964 --> 00:55:01.265]  Alex, how are you doing?
[00:55:01.305 --> 00:55:02.085]  I love your show.
[00:55:02.345 --> 00:55:03.206]  Well, I love you too, brother.
[00:55:03.246 --> 00:55:04.506]  I mean, I'm all right.
[00:55:04.546 --> 00:55:05.687]  I mean, how are you doing?
[00:55:05.707 --> 00:55:07.387]  I mean, I'm sitting here wondering, what do we do?
[00:55:07.688 --> 00:55:08.468]  How do we respond?
[00:55:08.508 --> 00:55:09.208]  What does Trump do?
[00:55:10.189 --> 00:55:11.790]  I'll tell you what, I'm fired up.
[00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:15.871]  I just got to tell you, I warned family, friends, everyone.
[00:55:15.891 --> 00:55:20.494]  I almost prophesied every day, almost, that we've got to get prepared.
[00:55:21.014 --> 00:55:25.376]  I don't want people to forget how she treated Kavanaugh.
[00:55:25.576 --> 00:55:27.957]  I think she was an obvious choice.
[00:55:28.479 --> 00:55:37.241]  For her connections and how embedded she is, but also she wasn't such an open Marxist like some of the others, so he couldn't choose them.
[00:55:38.561 --> 00:55:41.642]  And also, she's from San Francisco area, correct?
[00:55:41.862 --> 00:55:42.102]  Yes.
[00:55:42.122 --> 00:55:42.782]  The DA?
[00:55:42.962 --> 00:55:43.202]  Yes.
[00:55:43.722 --> 00:55:45.903]  Look who's the DA now in San Francisco.
[00:55:46.003 --> 00:55:49.024]  He's the son of the top Weatherman bombers.
[00:55:49.784 --> 00:55:50.264]  That's right.
[00:55:50.364 --> 00:55:51.824]  Bill Ayers and Bernadette Dorn.
[00:55:52.204 --> 00:55:53.685]  I mean, this goes deep.
[00:55:54.565 --> 00:55:55.645]  People need to wake up.
[00:55:56.605 --> 00:56:00.849]  I, uh, and also... Oh yeah, all these people are Weatherman alumni or they're children.
[00:56:01.909 --> 00:56:02.830]  Absolutely.
[00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:07.013]  And if people do not wake up to this, this is... Then you know what?
[00:56:07.074 --> 00:56:08.194]  Keep their heads in the sand.
[00:56:08.254 --> 00:56:10.436]  I've got a bug out plan, family, friends.
[00:56:10.536 --> 00:56:11.197]  We are ready.
[00:56:11.877 --> 00:56:15.981]  And, uh, and I mean truly, this is, uh, I pray every day.
[00:56:16.481 --> 00:56:17.582]  I have two young daughters.
[00:56:18.092 --> 00:56:21.314]  And I'll be damned if I'm going to let something take their nation down.
[00:56:21.614 --> 00:56:22.874]  It's over my dead body.
[00:56:23.134 --> 00:56:27.957]  But I do want to plug, Alex, I've got six months of the Patriot Supply.
[00:56:28.517 --> 00:56:30.078]  I take your supplements every day.
[00:56:30.278 --> 00:56:30.998]  The Red Pill.
[00:56:32.819 --> 00:56:33.599]  Red Pill Plus.
[00:56:33.679 --> 00:56:34.740]  I take the X2.
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:36.981]  And I just appreciate everything you do.
[00:56:37.927 --> 00:56:45.510]  Well, brother, I really appreciate you, and I'm here to tell you, you keep us on air under incredible withering attacks, but we're stronger for it.
[00:56:45.530 --> 00:56:51.833]  So just your word of mouth, your prayer, and your financial support when you also get great products at the same time is a 360 win, so thank you so much, sir.
[00:56:51.873 --> 00:56:54.234]  All right, let's jam in one more before we go to break here.
[00:56:55.075 --> 00:56:56.555]  Let's go to Robert in California.
[00:56:56.595 --> 00:56:57.296]  Robert, you're on the air.
[00:56:59.337 --> 00:56:59.797]  Hey, Alex.
[00:57:00.797 --> 00:57:01.097]  Welcome.
[00:57:01.938 --> 00:57:02.538]  Can you hear me okay?
[00:57:02.618 --> 00:57:03.118]  I can, yes.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:08.081]  You asked a question about what Trump should do about succession.
[00:57:08.741 --> 00:57:12.063]  Well, I ask you, what can you do about everything that's going on?
[00:57:12.563 --> 00:57:20.006]  He's limited there in the swamp, actually, and obviously they're censoring him in all media that he can.
[00:57:20.506 --> 00:57:27.949]  I think, again, that he should go on television and do a fireside chat and address the nation like the old days.
[00:57:28.550 --> 00:57:31.853]  And that way he can communicate directly to the people that way.
[00:57:32.173 --> 00:57:33.654]  Yeah, they don't want a press conference.
[00:57:33.674 --> 00:57:42.020]  They want him directly talking to us, I think, every night in the next 80 days because they shut down the rallies through all the fear.
[00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:44.562]  Oh, he can't have a rally, but the communists can.
[00:57:45.142 --> 00:57:48.105]  And so he's got to go on the warpath.
[00:57:48.525 --> 00:57:49.706]  He's got to expose.
[00:57:50.006 --> 00:57:55.150]  He's got to start talking about their plan to have states secede and have that repudiated ahead of them announcing it.
[00:57:56.616 --> 00:57:57.317]  Absolutely.
[00:57:57.757 --> 00:57:58.297]  Absolutely.
[00:57:58.457 --> 00:58:03.660]  And I think he's going, that's the only way I think he can reach the people directly is by back on television.
[00:58:04.701 --> 00:58:09.544]  Even after he's elected again, he should go and continue doing that.
[00:58:10.583 --> 00:58:16.327]  And also, I want to say something else, Alex, that you talk about a lot about praying and everyone should be praying.
[00:58:17.128 --> 00:58:18.328]  Robert, I don't want to cut you short.
[00:58:18.349 --> 00:58:22.812]  I'm going to put you on hold and come right back to Robert after the break, and then every other caller, we're getting to all of you.
[00:58:23.512 --> 00:58:27.055]  And I'm going to give you my views on what the President needs to do, but it's very similar to what Robert was just saying.
[00:58:27.635 --> 00:58:31.077]  And believe me, the President ends up getting this information, and we need the rest of Talk Radio to get this.
[00:58:31.518 --> 00:58:34.140]  This is the main talking point, not making fun of Kamala Harris.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:35.300]  Stay with us.
[00:58:36.801 --> 00:58:40.064]  We are living in such incredibly historic times that
[00:58:41.681 --> 00:58:48.866]  I just feel horribly guilty that when I'm not doing enough, I lay in bed at night for hours.
[00:58:49.967 --> 00:58:52.788]  I normally go to sleep so easy just trying to think about what can I do?
[00:58:52.888 --> 00:58:53.749]  What can I say?
[00:58:54.450 --> 00:58:55.670]  What should we say to the president?
[00:58:55.710 --> 00:58:56.591]  What can he do?
[00:58:57.191 --> 00:59:01.754]  And God just literally touches my heart and says, you need to pray more for people to awaken.
[00:59:01.774 --> 00:59:02.995]  You need to pray more for providence.
[00:59:03.015 --> 00:59:06.598]  You need to pray that the enemy's plans be frustrated.
[00:59:07.662 --> 00:59:16.790]  I mean, if you read what our ancestors did when they would win battles and wars, they would pray for days before those battles and seriously ask for God's guidance and ask for God's intervention.
[00:59:17.130 --> 00:59:18.011]  And Providence is real.
[00:59:18.451 --> 00:59:21.253]  George Washington was obsessed with it, and it was 100% real.
[00:59:22.774 --> 00:59:28.419]  You have to get God involved in everything, and you have to promise God that you're going to take action.
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:36.045]  So I think the biggest solution here is what I'm guessing Robert's about to go to, is humble ourselves and really
[00:59:37.116 --> 00:59:48.560]  Not be arrogant and prideful people and really think about the bad things we've done individually and really commit to God that we're going to stand up against evil and we're going to speak out against it and we're going to take action.
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:49.561]  And then do it.
[00:59:51.361 --> 00:59:55.743]  Because if God sees us take action, then God will get behind us like wind in the sails.
[00:59:55.783 --> 01:00:01.005]  But if we just sit there and do nothing, God will not be with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:00:02.444 --> 01:00:04.526]  And we are facing true evil.
[01:00:04.546 --> 01:00:05.507]  And I know it makes you sick.
[01:00:05.527 --> 01:00:10.691]  It makes me sick to see people going against their own common sense and against their own interests and just throwing everything away.
[01:00:11.738 --> 01:00:22.243]  And to see the evil boiling out of all their rat holes, pointing guns at innocent people, at Antifa checkpoints, and burning down courthouses, and screaming, we love Satan, and just all of it.
[01:00:22.343 --> 01:00:24.284]  But that's what we've allowed to breed.
[01:00:24.304 --> 01:00:26.105]  That's what we've allowed to grow.
[01:00:26.185 --> 01:00:29.167]  So that's what we've become, at least in many areas.
[01:00:29.827 --> 01:00:31.428]  And there's just a spirit of decadence.
[01:00:31.448 --> 01:00:32.809]  There's a spirit of anger.
[01:00:32.849 --> 01:00:35.330]  There's a spirit of not being thankful.
[01:00:35.950 --> 01:00:39.092]  And one thing my dad taught me that's always been important is being thankful
[01:00:40.092 --> 01:00:51.580]  For everything you get, for every breath you take, for every person you love, for every chance you've had, for all the beauty you've seen in the world, thanking God for that every minute is what's going to lift us up.
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:55.583]  The average leftist has money, power, you name it, and they are not happy.
[01:00:56.183 --> 01:00:59.486]  The average leftist minion doesn't have it, but the controllers do.
[01:00:59.806 --> 01:01:02.328]  And they're the most unhappy, empty people in the world.
[01:01:03.632 --> 01:01:06.875]  I've been to globalist events and democrat events.
[01:01:07.456 --> 01:01:15.264]  You get around them and they're all empty and they're all walking over to each other, trying to say things and look genuine, and it's totally fake!
[01:01:16.805 --> 01:01:21.670]  That's why the Hollywood and globalist money never was enticing.
[01:01:22.611 --> 01:01:26.716]  I mean, if it had smelled good and looked good and felt good to my soul, I might have got into it.
[01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:29.391]  But it was not hard to say no.
[01:01:30.011 --> 01:01:30.672]  It's creepy.
[01:01:30.732 --> 01:01:31.412]  It stinks.
[01:01:31.492 --> 01:01:32.373]  It's cold.
[01:01:32.393 --> 01:01:34.635]  It's creepy-crawly.
[01:01:35.375 --> 01:01:45.083]  And everything that God and Jesus gives me is just warm and powerful and strong and focused and true, but humbling.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:52.563]  And I look at the eyes of Hollywood people in these Hollywood magazines and publications and they just look demonically possessed.
[01:01:52.583 --> 01:02:00.247]  They could be black, they could be white, and they... I watch LeBron James when he's talking about himself and everything, and it's just delusion.
[01:02:01.908 --> 01:02:05.529]  They're just running a program in their head that they're God and you're not God.
[01:02:06.210 --> 01:02:08.431]  And so I really think it's we need to repent.
[01:02:09.503 --> 01:02:12.344]  And other than that, I'll talk, if we take more calls, what I think Trump should do.
[01:02:12.364 --> 01:02:14.885]  But we're taking your calls on what Trump should do right now.
[01:02:14.965 --> 01:02:15.945]  Robert, sorry I'm ranting.
[01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:16.965]  From California, go ahead.
[01:02:17.946 --> 01:02:19.106]  No, Alex, I agree with you.
[01:02:19.646 --> 01:02:22.067]  We talk about pray for intervention, and that's true.
[01:02:22.127 --> 01:02:31.290]  Let me also let you know and the listeners know that there will be a worldwide National Day of Repentance and Prayer rally at the Washington D.C.
[01:02:31.310 --> 01:02:32.810]  Mall on September 26th.
[01:02:33.130 --> 01:02:35.671]  That's a worldwide National Day of Prayer.
[01:02:36.717 --> 01:02:40.679]  I want to tell you that you go to the return website dot org.
[01:02:40.759 --> 01:02:44.200]  That's the return website dot org to get more information.
[01:02:44.661 --> 01:02:49.203]  But that will be a national and worldwide day of prayer.
[01:02:49.283 --> 01:02:50.203]  All denominations.
[01:02:50.323 --> 01:02:53.464]  Just go there and get the information and God help us all.
[01:02:53.925 --> 01:02:54.765]  And thank you, Alex.
[01:02:54.845 --> 01:02:55.685]  I love you so much.
[01:02:55.745 --> 01:02:57.426]  I listen to your show every day.
[01:02:57.446 --> 01:02:57.926]  Thank you, brother.
[01:02:58.326 --> 01:02:59.227]  Please just spread the word.
[01:02:59.287 --> 01:02:59.707]  We've got it.
[01:02:59.727 --> 01:03:00.988]  We've just got to get the word out.
[01:03:01.008 --> 01:03:02.028]  We've got to be the Paul Reveres.
[01:03:02.408 --> 01:03:03.669]  I know I keep saying that, but now.
[01:03:05.287 --> 01:03:07.508]  I wish I was wrong about all this every day.
[01:03:07.528 --> 01:03:10.168]  People say on the street, man, you're vindicated.
[01:03:10.188 --> 01:03:11.108]  I bet you're feeling good.
[01:03:11.128 --> 01:03:12.349]  I'm like, no, I ain't feeling good.
[01:03:12.369 --> 01:03:16.410]  Not feeling good about this.
[01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:17.130]  I know you're not either.
[01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:18.210]  This is bad, folks.
[01:03:18.230 --> 01:03:18.990]  This is bad.
[01:03:20.010 --> 01:03:21.211]  But I don't say that to scare you.
[01:03:21.291 --> 01:03:22.631]  I say that to get everybody moving.
[01:03:24.671 --> 01:03:26.052]  All right, who's been holding the longest here?
[01:03:27.412 --> 01:03:29.613]  Is it Robert or is it Jacob?
[01:03:30.753 --> 01:03:31.313]  Is it Tom?
[01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:37.151]  Tom in Delaware, then Tyson and others.
[01:03:37.171 --> 01:03:37.832]  Go ahead, Tom.
[01:03:37.872 --> 01:03:38.532]  You're on the air.
[01:03:39.173 --> 01:03:40.033]  Good afternoon, Alex.
[01:03:40.113 --> 01:03:43.856]  I'm calling with an action alert for patriots in the Delaware Valley.
[01:03:44.476 --> 01:03:48.900]  Anybody within a 50-mile radius of Wilmington, Delaware needs to show up at A.I.
[01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:51.161]  DuPont High School in Wilmington, Delaware.
[01:03:51.181 --> 01:03:53.083]  I have the address if you have your pen and paper.
[01:03:53.823 --> 01:03:56.966]  It's 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington, Delaware, 19807.
[01:03:57.606 --> 01:04:01.269]  Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be appearing at my alma mater.
[01:04:03.174 --> 01:04:08.095]  The state that he and the globalists like to use as their launchpad for their corrupt corporate agenda.
[01:04:08.775 --> 01:04:12.116]  And I think if Trump needs to do something, so do we.
[01:04:12.697 --> 01:04:14.257]  And we can all do something by showing up.
[01:04:14.297 --> 01:04:16.738]  Woody Allen said 50% of life is showing up.
[01:04:17.298 --> 01:04:24.220]  So anybody within the sound of my voice that can get there, it's less than an hour from Philadelphia, 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington, Delaware, 1987.
[01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:26.660]  Type it into your ways.
[01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.581]  Let's show up and tell Biden what we think.
[01:04:30.848 --> 01:04:31.469]  Well, I agree.
[01:04:32.209 --> 01:04:36.753]  We've got videos of Biden being confronted in San Antonio about the pedophilia and all the rest of it.
[01:04:37.233 --> 01:04:39.355]  We should get those back out and start running those.
[01:04:39.395 --> 01:04:52.585]  But the fact that Kamala Harris's family, not a long time ago, but in the last century, had slaves in Jamaica and people that were basically sharecroppers, blacks living on their plantation.
[01:04:52.645 --> 01:04:53.746]  I mean, it's just you can't.
[01:04:54.227 --> 01:04:57.229]  And then Hillary's caught smuggling kidnapped kids out of Haiti.
[01:04:57.289 --> 01:04:57.870]  It's just like,
[01:04:58.630 --> 01:05:05.432]  It is the craziest thing, and now their whole DNC event's gonna be the Clintons and Obama again?
[01:05:05.512 --> 01:05:06.892]  I mean, this is unbelievable.
[01:05:07.952 --> 01:05:15.134]  They think that Delaware is a sleepy backwater that they can use to set up these events away from, you know, national press coverage.
[01:05:15.834 --> 01:05:24.756]  And to your point with the pedophilia, Joe Biden's son, Beau Biden, who is revered as a sort of saint because he died of brain cancer, a former Attorney General of Delaware,
[01:05:26.195 --> 01:05:34.923]  Listen, I know somebody that grew up with the DuPonts and he said it's devil worship, pedophilia, and a bunch of the kids are trans and because they're just rejecting their identity and it's just it's the money's destroyed them.
[01:05:50.738 --> 01:05:54.160]  They're completely mentally ill, and that's one of the most powerful families in this country.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:06:01.745]  And that's where all this sickness comes from, is these sick families that are worth hundreds of billions of dollars or more, leveraging trillions.
[01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:07.008]  They have an agenda to ruin your life because you're happy, you're successful, you got red blood.
[01:06:07.328 --> 01:06:14.012]  You may be an old black truck driver, or a young white mechanic, or an Asian school teacher, or whatever you are.
[01:06:14.512 --> 01:06:20.517]  If you love God and justice and are thankful and appreciate life, they hate your guts because they've turned their back on life.
[01:06:20.777 --> 01:06:26.842]  Tom, tell me where this event is one more time, because yes, everywhere they go, people need to RSVP, need to try to get in.
[01:06:26.862 --> 01:06:28.163]  Most of these events will be staged.
[01:06:28.223 --> 01:06:30.485]  Go out and bullhorn them outside, stream it to the world.
[01:06:30.985 --> 01:06:31.325]  Go ahead.
[01:06:31.345 --> 01:06:34.228]  So the address is 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington, Delaware, 19807.
[01:06:36.189 --> 01:06:37.010]  There's no security.
[01:06:37.030 --> 01:06:37.510]  You can go in.
[01:06:37.530 --> 01:06:39.692]  There's a giant ring road around the entire school.
[01:06:40.072 --> 01:06:45.616]  We need to fill that road up with patriots screaming at Joe Biden because he thinks he's going to have a nice quiet rally.
[01:06:45.656 --> 01:06:50.600]  The AP article said there will be no adoring throngs due to coronavirus restrictions.
[01:06:51.020 --> 01:06:52.521]  Well, we need to prove how true that is.
[01:06:52.541 --> 01:06:52.841]  That's right.
[01:06:52.861 --> 01:06:55.143]  Corona is a smoke screen that they have no support.
[01:06:55.643 --> 01:06:57.384]  Corona is the lockdown smoke screen.
[01:06:58.005 --> 01:06:59.106]  It's all a giant hoax.
[01:06:59.166 --> 01:06:59.606]  Stay with us.
[01:06:59.626 --> 01:07:00.527]  More calls straight ahead.
[01:07:01.832 --> 01:07:04.793]  All right, let's try to go to a bunch of your calls now in this segment.
[01:07:04.933 --> 01:07:18.216]  I am Alex Jones, your host, and if you just joined us, I have dozens of incredible reports, all these amazing articles, huge astronomical discoveries, science discoveries, human-animal cloning news.
[01:07:19.576 --> 01:07:21.357]  Jordan Soros trying to crash the U.S.
[01:07:21.397 --> 01:07:23.217]  dollar, and that's part of this overthrow.
[01:07:23.897 --> 01:07:31.059]  But the Democrats hatched up the Russiagate thing, and we told you that, and then it was a three-year fiasco.
[01:07:32.776 --> 01:07:33.916]  Two and a half year fiasco.
[01:07:34.837 --> 01:07:50.463]  And now they're hatching up that they're not going to concede and that they're going to just say Biden's the president because he wins the popular vote in certain blue states and that they are forming a new America with a new inauguration.
[01:07:50.703 --> 01:07:52.184]  She said it's not about geography.
[01:07:52.584 --> 01:07:53.724]  He'll have his inauguration.
[01:07:53.764 --> 01:07:54.404]  We'll have ours.
[01:07:56.105 --> 01:07:57.246]  That's how globalists operate.
[01:07:57.266 --> 01:07:59.466]  They want to end convention to bring in their control.
[01:07:59.486 --> 01:08:00.747]  Remember Leo Zegami.
[01:08:02.831 --> 01:08:16.146]  Seven years before the new Jesuit pope came in, he said it will be this Jesuit pope, the other pope will stand down, you'll have two popes at once, and then they're going to get rid of a pope and have a council so that it's totally controlled by them because they don't even want one person in power.
[01:08:16.786 --> 01:08:18.608]  That's why they don't want Biden that strong.
[01:08:18.648 --> 01:08:19.790]  They don't want Harris that strong.
[01:08:20.250 --> 01:08:22.493]  They don't even trust Minions because sometimes they'll get uppity.
[01:08:24.216 --> 01:08:28.938]  They want people totally compromised, and that's what this is, and they're making the move.
[01:08:29.018 --> 01:08:31.119]  Donald Trump is their worst nightmare.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:38.323]  Pig-headed, smart, pro-America, common sense, pragmatic, not scared of them.
[01:08:38.403 --> 01:08:39.904]  He's God sent.
[01:08:40.004 --> 01:08:41.244]  It's how the universe works.
[01:08:42.205 --> 01:08:43.985]  But do we respond and support that?
[01:08:44.005 --> 01:08:48.588]  A lot of people get mad at Trump because he can't get everything done we want.
[01:08:48.668 --> 01:08:52.590]  Folks, I got over 100 crew members total with our operations, the things we do.
[01:08:53.797 --> 01:08:57.439]  And if they weren't behind me all the way, we couldn't get any of it done.
[01:08:57.819 --> 01:09:02.441]  You imagine Trump with all the traders and backstabbers and double talkers and triple dealers.
[01:09:02.501 --> 01:09:08.723]  I mean, I don't even like telling my crew what to do because I don't like boss people around and they're great.
[01:09:09.003 --> 01:09:11.284]  And I want to quit sometimes because I don't like being in charge.
[01:09:12.265 --> 01:09:16.206]  You imagine what it's like for Trump with backstabbers all around him.
[01:09:16.346 --> 01:09:17.807]  At 46 years old, I couldn't do it.
[01:09:17.827 --> 01:09:18.367]  He's 74 years old.
[01:09:23.373 --> 01:09:27.155]  Now he does yell and scream at people and does throw fits, but I mean, who wouldn't?
[01:09:27.175 --> 01:09:29.037]  Because he's got to be on all the rest of the time.
[01:09:29.657 --> 01:09:30.037]  Believe me.
[01:09:30.878 --> 01:09:34.380]  But it's just incredible.
[01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.061]  And we should be praying for President Trump.
[01:09:36.801 --> 01:09:37.722]  But I will tell you this.
[01:09:37.742 --> 01:09:42.765]  I'm going to go to your calls.
[01:09:42.805 --> 01:09:44.346]  I'll tell you next segment what I think the president should do.
[01:09:44.366 --> 01:09:47.248]  We're taking your calls on what you think he should do right now.
[01:09:48.228 --> 01:09:49.929]  Tyson in Mississippi, you're on the air.
[01:09:49.969 --> 01:09:50.650]  Welcome, Tyson.
[01:09:51.803 --> 01:09:52.604]  What's going on, Alex?
[01:09:52.644 --> 01:09:53.345]  How you doing today?
[01:09:53.805 --> 01:09:56.008]  Man, I just think every minute counts right now.
[01:09:56.048 --> 01:10:00.333]  I've never had it on my heart so strong that it's do or die and the stakes have never been higher.
[01:10:00.353 --> 01:10:00.793]  What do you think?
[01:10:02.375 --> 01:10:03.016]  Oh, yes, sir.
[01:10:03.176 --> 01:10:04.037]  I agree with you.
[01:10:04.237 --> 01:10:04.798]  Absolutely.
[01:10:05.278 --> 01:10:11.746]  I believe Corona, this whole Corona deal, has expanded the internet, societal internet integration.
[01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:24.418]  And through that, it's making us go rely on Apple and these big tech industries, because it's forcing society to use their products, because everything from all corporations now have their apps.
[01:10:24.798 --> 01:10:31.061]  It's part of the AI takeover, and then when more deadly viruses come out, robots and driverless cars will have to take care of us.
[01:10:31.321 --> 01:10:32.622]  We're being domesticated right now.
[01:10:33.662 --> 01:10:34.623]  That's exactly right.
[01:10:35.143 --> 01:10:40.105]  And I also know why we sit back and we just allow these things to happen, and because it's
[01:10:41.050 --> 01:10:46.773]  It's that people don't know about it, and when people find out about it, they just don't care to even change anything about it.
[01:10:47.273 --> 01:10:54.456]  Well, that's because they've all been taught to be responders in the spectator sense, not actors, not people that are actually involved and engaged.
[01:10:54.776 --> 01:11:02.740]  So everyone's thinking one-dimensional, they don't respect themselves, and they don't think they're going to get ahead by caring that they're being screwed over.
[01:11:03.080 --> 01:11:05.101]  And so really, they've been given over to grand delusion.
[01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:06.600]  Indeed.
[01:11:07.041 --> 01:11:11.885]  And also, with this whole internet integration, it's also normalizing the mail-in ballots.
[01:11:12.406 --> 01:11:16.149]  Because, you know, I need to get my groceries delivered to my house now.
[01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:17.390]  Well, I can't go out in public.
[01:11:17.511 --> 01:11:18.852]  I'll get Corona.
[01:11:19.232 --> 01:11:21.034]  So now I need to mail in my ballot.
[01:11:21.334 --> 01:11:28.516]  And they don't even understand that's breaking down the roads, the civilization, the infrastructure that's built around us traveling and moving and being involved.
[01:11:28.536 --> 01:11:34.398]  They're destroying the human infrastructure that no military or war could do.
[01:11:34.958 --> 01:11:35.998]  Kill people, break things.
[01:11:36.018 --> 01:11:43.740]  Well, this is killing industry, killing savings, killing infrastructure, killing the production capacity in a trade war with China.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:46.281]  But it's a bigger picture about the AI takeover.
[01:11:46.541 --> 01:11:48.862]  And they admit now it's about the AI takeover.
[01:11:48.902 --> 01:11:49.562]  You're absolutely right.
[01:11:50.242 --> 01:11:53.164]  What does President Trump need to do?
[01:11:53.284 --> 01:11:58.868]  Trump needs to, well, first of all, so it's not, the question is, would you get a Neuralink brain chip?
[01:11:58.908 --> 01:11:59.708]  That's not the question.
[01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:04.932]  The question is, should we allow people to have internet integrated AI neural implants?
[01:12:05.372 --> 01:12:11.516]  Because once we allow people to have AI implants, then that completely will change society as we know it.
[01:12:11.897 --> 01:12:16.640]  Not just for the people who do have them, but it will completely change for the people who don't have them.
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:18.161]  And Facebook, Twitter,
[01:12:19.926 --> 01:12:26.363]  Google, Apple, they're all racing Elon Musk with their brain chip neural uplinks as the new future.
[01:12:27.509 --> 01:12:34.874]  No one in the mainstream media will say anything against it, nor comprehend it at all.
[01:12:35.334 --> 01:12:35.834]  That's right.
[01:12:35.894 --> 01:12:38.656]  We were total kooks to warn this was all coming decades ago.
[01:12:39.217 --> 01:12:39.897]  Now it's here.
[01:12:40.257 --> 01:12:41.798]  It's all positive reporting on it.
[01:12:42.078 --> 01:12:43.179]  And if you don't like it, you're bad.
[01:12:43.319 --> 01:12:43.840]  Thank you, sir.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:44.500]  Great points.
[01:12:45.541 --> 01:12:46.241]  It's revelation.
[01:12:46.541 --> 01:12:47.222]  It's all happening.
[01:12:47.442 --> 01:12:51.124]  And the globalists admit it's about a post-human world to make humans obsolete.
[01:12:51.544 --> 01:12:55.767]  And then those that choose to, quote, live will voluntarily give up their bodies and be uploaded.
[01:12:55.847 --> 01:12:56.668]  No, you're going to be dying.
[01:12:57.944 --> 01:13:02.146]  But see, to criticize someone becoming trans, it's not about chopping your balls off, folks.
[01:13:02.166 --> 01:13:02.986]  That's just phase one.
[01:13:03.006 --> 01:13:05.107]  It's not just about becoming a cyborg.
[01:13:05.127 --> 01:13:08.329]  You have to give the body up to be carbon neutral and save the Earth.
[01:13:08.649 --> 01:13:18.213]  And then you can't say that someone in a computer that copies their voice, their personality, that even has a machine avatar, or even a flesh avatar, you can't ever say that's not real.
[01:13:18.473 --> 01:13:20.014]  That would be the ultimate thought crime.
[01:13:20.694 --> 01:13:25.256]  Because they need everyone to voluntarily kill themselves believing they're uploading.
[01:13:25.696 --> 01:13:26.537]  Believe me, years from now,
[01:13:28.953 --> 01:13:31.716]  If you can even find this information, you'll be watching this going, how did he know this?
[01:13:31.976 --> 01:13:33.218]  The enemy is public about it.
[01:13:34.379 --> 01:13:35.620]  Jamming another call here.
[01:13:36.541 --> 01:13:42.327]  Let's go ahead and talk to Robert in Florida.
[01:13:42.368 --> 01:13:43.128]  Robert, you're on the air.
[01:13:43.168 --> 01:13:43.469]  Welcome.
[01:13:44.642 --> 01:13:45.362]  Hello, sir.
[01:13:45.402 --> 01:13:46.062]  How are you doing?
[01:13:46.123 --> 01:13:47.803]  It's an honor to speak with you, Alex Jones.
[01:13:47.863 --> 01:13:49.564]  My name is Robert Christensen.
[01:13:49.624 --> 01:13:56.446]  I'm over here in Spring Hill, Florida, and I was the spark to something that is taking off like a wildfire in this area.
[01:13:56.626 --> 01:13:56.966]  Bravo.
[01:13:57.186 --> 01:13:59.207]  Called Operation Flag Drop.
[01:14:01.828 --> 01:14:02.368]  Tell us about it.
[01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:07.492]  Alright, and pretty much, it's every Friday, 6pm to 8pm, okay?
[01:14:07.632 --> 01:14:12.815]  Every Friday, you get people together, you get to a main intersection, and you do your love for Trump.
[01:14:12.895 --> 01:14:14.656]  Get out, get people active.
[01:14:14.776 --> 01:14:17.197]  Get people on the ground in these, everywhere.
[01:14:17.457 --> 01:14:17.818]  Everywhere.
[01:14:18.958 --> 01:14:21.439]  6pm to 8pm, to show the polls are lying.
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:24.581]  Also, expose the scandemic for what it is.
[01:14:25.563 --> 01:14:28.524]  This is pure genius, and if Trump won't have the rallies because his people are too cowardly,
[01:14:42.328 --> 01:14:45.509]  We all have to start having these rallies for Trump in America everywhere.
[01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:47.570]  We have to hit the streets in a peaceful way.
[01:14:47.890 --> 01:14:48.931]  You're an absolute genius.
[01:14:49.371 --> 01:14:56.214]  Is there a website or do people just get together and say, we're going to be at the corner of this with flags and just, it'll be one of you at first.
[01:14:56.514 --> 01:14:58.555]  And then you drive by, you honk, pull over and join them.
[01:14:59.795 --> 01:15:01.316]  Tell us how this started and what's coming next.
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:06.584]  That's exactly how this started, because there was Joe Biden people rallying over here.
[01:15:06.624 --> 01:15:08.005]  I just wanted my Taco Bell.
[01:15:08.025 --> 01:15:13.950]  But then he said that American flags are a symbol of oppression and that Donald Trump supporters are too cowardly to face.
[01:15:13.970 --> 01:15:17.653]  So I went and stood out there by myself with a homemade Trump sign.
[01:15:17.713 --> 01:15:19.874]  Next thing I know, there's 10 people standing with me.
[01:15:19.914 --> 01:15:21.236]  And we said, let's keep this going.
[01:15:21.276 --> 01:15:24.999]  Now we have over 550 active members in our area.
[01:15:25.539 --> 01:15:30.323]  And then nationally, we got over 12,000 people participating last Friday.
[01:15:31.539 --> 01:15:35.321]  Join the National Flag Drop Movement to Save America.
[01:15:35.341 --> 01:15:37.582]  We'll put an article and a video out on this, brother.
[01:15:38.462 --> 01:15:44.285]  I know Facebook will probably ban a page if you have it, but where can people find photos or information about this?
[01:15:45.765 --> 01:15:48.987]  Operation Flag Drop Trump 2020 on Facebook.
[01:15:49.167 --> 01:15:51.628]  We also do a Coffee with Conservatives.
[01:15:51.988 --> 01:15:53.429]  It's like a little talk show.
[01:15:53.469 --> 01:15:54.569]  You inspired me to do it.
[01:15:55.850 --> 01:15:56.530]  Very exciting.
[01:15:56.590 --> 01:15:57.111]  Say that again.
[01:15:57.171 --> 01:15:57.831]  How do people find you?
[01:15:58.648 --> 01:15:59.489]  Right on Facebook.
[01:15:59.509 --> 01:16:03.872]  It's Coffee with Conservatives or Spring Hill Operation Flag Drop Trump 2020.
[01:16:04.613 --> 01:16:07.035]  I want Operation Flag Drop nationwide.
[01:16:07.135 --> 01:16:08.336]  That is a huge solution.
[01:16:08.696 --> 01:16:10.117]  I'm gonna do it myself this Friday.
[01:16:10.137 --> 01:16:11.118]  You've got my commitment.
[01:16:11.478 --> 01:16:14.260]  Operation Flag Drop goes live worldwide.
[01:16:15.401 --> 01:16:17.123]  This nation is under siege.
[01:16:19.363 --> 01:16:27.406]  They've created a normalcy bias where we just think things are okay and that we're still in a free country and the social contract hasn't been broken.
[01:16:27.486 --> 01:16:37.229]  It's been broken by the deep state, by the globalists, by the Democrats, by all the slobs that have not been working for decades and expect us to take care of them that want to hold us hostage.
[01:16:37.649 --> 01:16:42.050]  And now the Democrats are holding the country hostage saying they're going to contest the election.
[01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:44.191]  They know there's going to be a landslide.
[01:16:47.423 --> 01:16:53.884]  And so they're going to have states secede and they're going to trigger race war on the back of George Floyd.
[01:16:55.745 --> 01:17:02.626]  Whereas I can show you four videos that came out just since last night of white people being executed just because they're white.
[01:17:03.866 --> 01:17:04.906]  And white people being beaten.
[01:17:05.907 --> 01:17:06.367]  But you know what?
[01:17:06.387 --> 01:17:07.447]  I can't even bring myself to do it.
[01:17:11.628 --> 01:17:12.768]  But I will because we have to.
[01:17:14.178 --> 01:17:14.878]  Wrong narrative!
[01:17:14.998 --> 01:17:15.298]  U.S.
[01:17:15.339 --> 01:17:26.643]  mainstream media, mom on murder of five-year-old white boy, shot in the back of the head in his own front yard by the black neighbor because he rode his bike through the edge of his yard.
[01:17:27.204 --> 01:17:30.805]  Killed him execution style in front of his two seven and eight-year-old sisters.
[01:17:32.846 --> 01:17:35.247]  The father, looking out the window, thought it was a joke.
[01:17:35.427 --> 01:17:38.028]  Thought it must have been a cap gun, but it wasn't.
[01:17:38.649 --> 01:17:40.309]  Zero coverage in the mainstream media.
[01:17:41.290 --> 01:17:41.810]  This happened
[01:17:42.981 --> 01:17:47.907]  But four or five days ago only hit the real media yesterday.
[01:17:49.169 --> 01:17:51.411]  And Twitter and Facebook are blocking posts about it.
[01:17:52.573 --> 01:17:53.454]  Dehumanizing.
[01:17:53.774 --> 01:17:54.795]  Now I don't want race riots.
[01:17:54.815 --> 01:18:00.442]  I don't want to randomly go target black people because a crazy black person, looks like he's out of his mind, killed him.
[01:18:01.163 --> 01:18:02.445]  I want to see the guy get the death penalty.
[01:18:04.306 --> 01:18:05.047]  Not because he's black.
[01:18:05.147 --> 01:18:15.779]  I mean, if a white guy ran up and shot some little black kid randomly, you'd have this country burning down right now because the media would say, it's not a crazy white guy, it's every white person's fault.
[01:18:17.961 --> 01:18:21.304]  So this poor little white boy, no one will ever care about his name.
[01:18:22.225 --> 01:18:25.149]  He's got a GoFundMe that our camera guy actually gave some money to.
[01:18:27.759 --> 01:18:28.119]  Pitiful.
[01:18:28.139 --> 01:18:29.360]  Almost no money's been given to him.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:31.823]  If he was black, it'd be a $50 million right now.
[01:18:32.103 --> 01:18:37.828]  But it'd all be directed to Kamala Harris, who likes to lock black folks up, and to Joe Biden, who likes the Black Lives Matter money.
[01:18:37.848 --> 01:18:39.229]  It gets all of it directed to them.
[01:18:40.570 --> 01:18:47.956]  Sort of a five-year-old North Carolina boy who reportedly was killed when a man ran up to him and shot him in the head for no reason, apparently.
[01:18:50.378 --> 01:18:53.141]  Was not compelling enough to merit U.S.
[01:18:53.181 --> 01:18:54.182]  mainstream media coverage.
[01:18:55.902 --> 01:19:03.605]  The boy, Cannon Hennett, was riding his bike in front of his house Sunday in North Carolina.
[01:19:04.725 --> 01:19:06.466]  The 25-year-old suspect was a neighbor.
[01:19:06.926 --> 01:19:13.208]  He reportedly walked up in front of all these witnesses and shot the boy multiple times in the back of the head in front of his seven and eight-year-old sister.
[01:19:16.609 --> 01:19:19.590]  The hair-raising details have never hit mainstream news.
[01:19:23.075 --> 01:19:23.455]  Oh boy.
[01:19:23.955 --> 01:19:26.196]  Five-year-old executed while playing in the street.
[01:19:26.256 --> 01:19:30.837]  Police arrest 25-year-old neighbor, Darius Cissoms.
[01:19:36.498 --> 01:19:40.679]  You know, I don't care if the person's black or white, but when they got eyes that look like that, you need to move.
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:46.461]  If I lived next door to that guy, I'd go live in a ditch before I lived next to that guy.
[01:19:46.501 --> 01:19:48.341]  That guy looks like a serial killer.
[01:19:51.479 --> 01:19:53.599]  And there's something in these demons that hates children.
[01:19:53.919 --> 01:19:55.160]  The left wants to kill babies.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:56.500]  They don't care what color they are.
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:19:58.320]  They want to kill them in the womb, out of the womb.
[01:19:58.340 --> 01:19:59.000]  They want them dead.
[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:00.801]  You look at that look.
[01:20:03.101 --> 01:20:05.341]  That's not a person driving that soul.
[01:20:06.582 --> 01:20:07.442]  See that dead look?
[01:20:08.342 --> 01:20:09.682]  The person has been pushed back.
[01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:11.182]  The soul's been pushed back or out.
[01:20:12.082 --> 01:20:14.223]  There's something else looking right through that face.
[01:20:15.463 --> 01:20:16.723]  You look at Joe Biden's eyes.
[01:20:16.763 --> 01:20:18.103]  Look at Kamala Harris's eyes.
[01:20:18.124 --> 01:20:18.964]  It's the same thing.
[01:20:19.684 --> 01:20:20.784]  They're called shark eyes.
[01:20:22.867 --> 01:20:24.148]  Somebody's got shark eyes.
[01:20:26.610 --> 01:20:27.371]  Like Tim Cook.
[01:20:29.052 --> 01:20:29.873]  You know they're bad.
[01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:34.277]  Wow!
[01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.101]  Unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:20:41.122 --> 01:20:42.604]  They can't even hide what they are.
[01:20:44.365 --> 01:20:44.705]  Demons.
[01:20:46.527 --> 01:20:48.989]  We got a demon problem, folks, not a racial problem.
[01:20:50.185 --> 01:20:53.906]  But some groups do seem to be more susceptible to the infestation.
[01:20:53.986 --> 01:20:54.866]  It's a very sad thing.
[01:20:58.187 --> 01:20:58.847]  Very, very sad.
[01:21:00.907 --> 01:21:03.448]  Now, who's been holding longest?
[01:21:03.468 --> 01:21:04.588]  That'd be Dylan in Colorado.
[01:21:04.608 --> 01:21:05.368]  Dylan, thanks for holding.
[01:21:05.388 --> 01:21:06.109]  Go ahead, Dylan.
[01:21:07.649 --> 01:21:09.329]  Mr. Jones, can you hear me loud and clear?
[01:21:09.389 --> 01:21:10.029]  Loud and clear, brother.
[01:21:10.049 --> 01:21:10.610]  Thanks for calling.
[01:21:11.690 --> 01:21:12.530]  Oh, good.
[01:21:13.570 --> 01:21:16.851]  Man, I don't mean to be the Dylan Downer of the broadcast,
[01:21:17.563 --> 01:21:35.151]  But over the past few weeks, you've asked what we can do, and you've had at least one person every single broadcast say that if we just, you know, pray to God and submit to Jesus, that we'll have this hedge of protection lifted above us.
[01:21:35.491 --> 01:21:39.113]  And I just, I can't disagree with that more.
[01:21:39.813 --> 01:21:43.695]  We may have had a hedge of protection at one point, but it is gone.
[01:21:44.335 --> 01:21:46.356]  It is gone at this point.
[01:21:46.894 --> 01:21:48.355]  We've killed millions.
[01:21:48.415 --> 01:21:49.576]  I think you're misunderstanding.
[01:21:49.616 --> 01:21:50.996]  People want the hedge protection back.
[01:21:51.076 --> 01:21:53.698]  I think everybody agrees it's being lifted right now.
[01:21:55.579 --> 01:21:59.601]  But the only thing we can do to get that back is to fight this.
[01:21:59.641 --> 01:22:02.843]  I think what is coming is coming and I don't think we can stop that.
[01:22:02.883 --> 01:22:05.825]  No, no, I agree that it's just going to get worse from here on out.
[01:22:06.525 --> 01:22:07.406]  Trump was just a
[01:22:08.496 --> 01:22:11.137]  Exactly, but I don't think God wants monks right now.
[01:22:11.157 --> 01:22:11.757]  He wants warriors.
[01:22:34.096 --> 01:22:37.699]  And I think the only way to do that is to actually get involved.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.541]  I'm 29 years old.
[01:22:39.942 --> 01:22:44.546]  I've been listening to you since 2010, probably.
[01:22:45.307 --> 01:22:48.249]  And I've enlisted in the military.
[01:22:48.810 --> 01:22:55.196]  I think we need to do exactly what the, I don't even want to call them Democrats, but what these
[01:22:56.207 --> 01:22:58.249]  I agree.
[01:22:58.269 --> 01:23:02.113]  They want to take over our institutions and ruin them and make all the good men and women get out.
[01:23:02.553 --> 01:23:09.100]  No, the answer is join all the institutions and let God's spirit guide you, but don't be like the left.
[01:23:09.120 --> 01:23:10.282]  Don't lie about what you stand for.
[01:23:10.802 --> 01:23:13.663]  Do your job, but if God tells you keep your mouth shut, keep your mouth shut.
[01:23:13.703 --> 01:23:15.063]  God tells you don't, talk.
[01:23:15.103 --> 01:23:22.486]  But get in, go up through the organizations like the communists have done, so that at key points, we can then destroy them.
[01:23:22.546 --> 01:23:24.967]  We need to go back into the institutions and take them back.
[01:23:25.347 --> 01:23:29.288]  Corporate institutions, educational institutions, governmental institutions.
[01:23:29.648 --> 01:23:36.350]  And just being on the street and in our own families, we have to start working hard and standing up for our families.
[01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:37.691]  That means spending time with our children,
[01:23:38.231 --> 01:23:47.037]  And it means getting out and demonstrating, and it means suing people, and it means if somebody walks up as a leftist and attacks you, it means defending yourself, and it means becoming men again.
[01:23:48.798 --> 01:23:49.358]  Exactly.
[01:23:49.438 --> 01:23:53.121]  Pray to God, but row the damn boat to shore.
[01:23:56.143 --> 01:23:56.903]  Hunter S. Thompson.
[01:23:57.704 --> 01:23:58.204]  God bless you.
[01:23:58.224 --> 01:24:01.186]  Which is a rip-off of a Bedouin saying, trust in God, but tie up your camel.
[01:24:01.486 --> 01:24:04.568]  It's like, hey, God's there for you, but tie your camel up or it's gonna run off.
[01:24:05.869 --> 01:24:06.890]  Let's do another caller here.
[01:24:08.459 --> 01:24:09.779]  Let's go to Ivan and then Chris.
[01:24:09.939 --> 01:24:11.160]  Ivan in Oklahoma.
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:11.680]  Thanks for holding.
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:12.060]  Go ahead.
[01:24:13.180 --> 01:24:13.700]  Hello, Alex.
[01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:15.140]  I'm calling from Oklahoma.
[01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:15.741]  How are you, sir?
[01:24:16.221 --> 01:24:19.041]  Man, I tell you, I'm certainly not bored.
[01:24:19.101 --> 01:24:21.522]  I'm pretty excited.
[01:24:21.542 --> 01:24:22.642]  These are crazy times, brother.
[01:24:23.642 --> 01:24:24.622]  It's the first time caller.
[01:24:25.063 --> 01:24:26.163]  I'm kind of nervous.
[01:24:26.503 --> 01:24:27.223]  You can hear my voice.
[01:24:27.243 --> 01:24:28.343]  Don't be nervous, Ivan.
[01:24:28.383 --> 01:24:29.143]  Tell us what's on your mind.
[01:24:32.211 --> 01:24:41.675]  I was trying to call yesterday and well they told me to talk about today's topic but I wanted to talk about you know how we've seen these protests in different cities.
[01:24:42.235 --> 01:24:45.677]  Why haven't we seen them go all over?
[01:24:45.697 --> 01:24:50.419]  You know here where I live you barely see people
[01:24:51.227 --> 01:24:56.351]  On the street, on the sidewalk, where they just write, you know, BLM and this and that.
[01:24:56.411 --> 01:25:02.916]  That's because the BLM antifa is synthetic and is only done in blue cities where they're with the police chiefs in crime.
[01:25:04.057 --> 01:25:04.397]  Okay.
[01:25:06.158 --> 01:25:16.646]  And, you know, I was just, you know, kind of wondering, you know, we see this in big cities, but not in, you know, all across, you know, and it just keeps me on my feet.
[01:25:16.686 --> 01:25:19.308]  You know, I kind of look here and there just
[01:25:19.778 --> 01:25:21.459]  Kind of keeping an open eye.
[01:25:24.082 --> 01:25:28.085]  Anyway, I just want to say, sir, I've been praying for you.
[01:25:28.105 --> 01:25:33.249]  I've been praying for the whole InfoWars staff every day when I go to bed and when I wake up.
[01:25:34.930 --> 01:25:37.853]  And I am always praying for the president and the administration.
[01:25:38.273 --> 01:25:41.656]  I'm always praying for you guys and thank you for the job that you do, sir.
[01:25:42.977 --> 01:25:46.059]  I try and listen to your broadcast even after it airs.
[01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:49.342]  Keeps me on what's going on because
[01:25:49.741 --> 01:25:53.208]  For me, primarily, I don't listen to the mainstream media anymore.
[01:25:53.449 --> 01:25:53.950]  I stopped.
[01:25:54.699 --> 01:25:55.359]  Long time ago.
[01:25:55.720 --> 01:25:58.781]  Well, they're there to distort things, and what you're doing is awesome, Ivan.
[01:25:58.801 --> 01:26:04.485]  And every person you tell about NewsWars.com or Band.Video or go, hey, you've heard of InfoWars, it's demonized.
[01:26:04.885 --> 01:26:11.789]  You can go there and actually see what they don't want you to see, all the banned doctors, all the truth about COVID, and people are really receptive right now, sir.
[01:26:12.049 --> 01:26:12.829]  God bless you, Ivan.
[01:26:13.270 --> 01:26:14.630]  All right, we're going to start the next hour.
[01:26:14.650 --> 01:26:16.711]  I got a guest popping in, but we're going to continue with calls.
[01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:20.053]  The guest is on for a couple segments, but we're going to go to everybody.
[01:26:20.073 --> 01:26:20.674]  We're going to get to
[01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:28.014]  Isaiah, Flo, Jacob, Howard, Matthew, Tim, Chris, Kathy, and others.
[01:26:28.034 --> 01:26:29.975]  In fact, we'll go to Kathy first, then we'll go to Chris.
[01:26:30.436 --> 01:26:37.300]  We'll get to everybody here, because, I mean, they're telling you they're going to contest the election to create the breakdown of society.
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:39.921]  That's what the chi-coms, the globalists, wants, the breakup of the country.
[01:26:40.121 --> 01:26:41.702]  You're like, the Democrats will probably lose that.
[01:26:42.042 --> 01:26:42.783]  They don't care!
[01:26:42.803 --> 01:26:43.924]  They're like a bomb!
[01:26:44.064 --> 01:26:45.084]  They're meant to tear it apart!
[01:26:45.104 --> 01:26:45.765]  We'll be right back!
[01:26:47.045 --> 01:26:50.968]  You know, I feel a big weight off of me in one respect, but a bigger new weight in another way.
[01:26:52.196 --> 01:27:08.481]  World government's out in the open, we were dead on about it all, and now we're really faced with the long, hard haul up against the anti-Christ AI system that we're going to end up defeating with God's help, but not before the enemy gets control for a while and gets to take us down for a deep dive of real torture.
[01:27:08.901 --> 01:27:10.561]  But that's what we deserve for what we've done.
[01:27:11.021 --> 01:27:15.443]  God's going to test us as men and women, and I appreciate the fact that God's doing that so that we can be
[01:27:16.343 --> 01:27:19.766]  Reunited with Christ, and so we can go through the fire and become more Christ-like.
[01:27:20.327 --> 01:27:24.251]  But I assure you, all of you out there that want to dodge the pain, the pain's coming.
[01:27:24.631 --> 01:27:28.374]  You're not going to dodge it, so you better get ready to get into it and enjoy it.
[01:27:28.775 --> 01:27:32.939]  Because it's not going to physically feel good, but in the end, you will be stronger because of it.
[01:27:33.499 --> 01:27:39.061]  We're taking your phone calls about the globalists and their announcement of civil war and secession, the breakup of the United States.
[01:27:39.382 --> 01:27:41.703]  They're announcing it like it's just a no big deal in the news?
[01:27:41.763 --> 01:27:42.083]  Hey!
[01:27:42.643 --> 01:27:44.043]  And, well, what should we do?
[01:27:44.404 --> 01:27:46.885]  Kathy in New York, thanks for calling, thanks for holding.
[01:27:46.925 --> 01:27:47.245]  Welcome.
[01:27:49.126 --> 01:27:49.686]  Yes, hi.
[01:27:50.046 --> 01:27:51.667]  I've been listening to you since 1996.
[01:27:52.507 --> 01:27:56.709]  I'm a longtime listener here, and I hope I don't trip over my words because I'm nervous.
[01:27:56.769 --> 01:27:57.889]  Please don't be nervous, Kathy.
[01:27:57.909 --> 01:27:58.510]  We love your voice.
[01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.910]  Go ahead.
[01:27:59.910 --> 01:28:00.190]  Okay.
[01:28:00.450 --> 01:28:01.751]  What President Trump should do
[01:28:02.483 --> 01:28:10.447]  Already, people are sort of like geared into going and getting tested, sitting in their cars, you know, waiting to be tested.
[01:28:10.767 --> 01:28:13.509]  This is what we should do when people go to vote.
[01:28:13.809 --> 01:28:17.511]  We already have the voting places already in place.
[01:28:18.423 --> 01:28:39.111]  And someone should, people would line up in their cars, people would go along and give people each a voting ballot that they would use, the machines would be set up outside, there'd be lines, and then people would then, by that point, have filled out their ballot, drive up, put it through the machine, and be done with it.
[01:28:40.392 --> 01:28:43.933]  Because it's already in place, let's just tweak it a little bit.
[01:28:44.651 --> 01:28:47.032]  And President Trump should do that.
[01:28:47.772 --> 01:29:00.716]  Also, I mean, he definitely should be exposing the criminals here so people can see and understand these people that are trying to speak against him, that they're actually criminals, okay?
[01:29:01.436 --> 01:29:12.299]  And if anyone, any of your listeners are skeptical about this coup, Nancy Pelosi herself revealed it when she said that she was second in line.
[01:29:13.766 --> 01:29:16.048]  You, when you first heard that, you thought, what is she talking about?
[01:29:16.088 --> 01:29:17.069]  Doesn't she understand?
[01:29:17.649 --> 01:29:18.710]  Yes, she does.
[01:29:19.190 --> 01:29:20.672]  She, this is the coup.
[01:29:20.932 --> 01:29:23.954]  You get rid of Trump and Pence and then they go in.
[01:29:24.434 --> 01:29:27.437]  So you have to listen to what, you know, these people are saying.
[01:29:28.428 --> 01:29:32.070]  So, I wanted to, you know, definitely let you know about that.
[01:29:32.130 --> 01:29:34.211]  And also, I'm 71 years old.
[01:29:34.432 --> 01:29:36.333]  Wanted to let you know I'm using BodyEase.
[01:29:36.933 --> 01:29:50.581]  And I'm telling you, after you take it, it's for me, for myself, 30 days, I started to notice giant increases in my mobility with my arm that I injured when I was exercising.
[01:29:51.261 --> 01:29:52.622]  And it's really working for me.
[01:29:52.642 --> 01:29:54.363]  So, I just wanted people to know that as well.
[01:29:54.663 --> 01:29:57.305]  How long did it take for BodyEase to kick in for you, Kathy?
[01:29:59.502 --> 01:30:13.232]  Well, it took, as I say, it took about 30 days for me to take it, and then all of a sudden after that 30 days, each day I took it, I started to feel large increases.
[01:30:13.612 --> 01:30:17.195]  But in the beginning, I'd say about the third week, I started to feel
[01:30:17.595 --> 01:30:19.597]  Something really starting to change.
[01:30:19.658 --> 01:30:21.139]  Well, that's exactly what I tell people.
[01:30:21.239 --> 01:30:23.061]  With the DNA force, it takes about a month.
[01:30:23.522 --> 01:30:25.504]  With the iodine, it takes about two weeks.
[01:30:26.025 --> 01:30:32.492]  And with the bodies, depending on how old the person is, two weeks to a month for it to really build up and then have its cumulative effect.
[01:30:32.973 --> 01:30:36.436]  And I mean, because humanoids are powerful, they're known what they do.
[01:30:36.977 --> 01:30:39.519]  And that's why I just encourage people to get bodies.
[01:30:39.559 --> 01:30:42.240]  We have the new liquid turmeric extract as well.
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:44.501]  They don't compete with each other, other apples and oranges.
[01:30:44.882 --> 01:30:48.063]  You know, I said I'd do it last segment, but I'll do it next segment.
[01:30:48.083 --> 01:30:51.866]  I'm going to tell people briefly what I think President Trump should do, but it's basically what you're saying.
[01:30:52.466 --> 01:30:53.327]  We have to get over
[01:30:54.298 --> 01:30:58.962]  The stigma of how crazy the Democrats are, if we repeat what they're saying, it sounds like a lie.
[01:30:59.682 --> 01:31:05.307]  Like when I say the Austin City Council has a proposal in the budget to blow up the police department.
[01:31:05.487 --> 01:31:08.830]  When I say that, I feel like I'm lying, because it just sounds crazy.
[01:31:09.410 --> 01:31:09.971]  But it's true.
[01:31:10.311 --> 01:31:11.212]  Kathy, we love you.
[01:31:11.472 --> 01:31:15.295]  Amazing that you've been listening for 25 years or so, and we really appreciate you.
[01:31:17.352 --> 01:31:17.852]  Call again.
[01:31:17.872 --> 01:31:18.912]  All right.
[01:31:18.953 --> 01:31:21.273]  More calls straight ahead in 60 seconds.
[01:31:21.333 --> 01:31:24.834]  And we have a special guest I'll tell you about coming up as well and some special reports.
[01:31:25.314 --> 01:31:27.455]  And InfoWars is trending on Twitter again.
[01:31:27.995 --> 01:31:29.616]  Yes, wait till we tell you about that.
[01:31:30.896 --> 01:31:42.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, even on Fox News, they're saying students should wear armbands that track their temperature and yellow buttons if they haven't been vaccinated, meaning no one can touch them.
[01:31:44.650 --> 01:31:47.731]  They're getting you ready for the forced inoculations and the contact tracers.
[01:31:49.151 --> 01:31:50.471]  A bipartisan takeover.
[01:31:51.771 --> 01:31:56.752]  New Jersey governor also mandated temperature tracking armbands for students and staff at schools.
[01:31:58.413 --> 01:32:01.653]  Deanna Lorraine, always a great interview, is on top of it all.
[01:32:01.693 --> 01:32:04.674]  She'll be joining us coming up next segment to go over all that.
[01:32:04.974 --> 01:32:06.975]  InfoWars is one of the top trends.
[01:32:07.235 --> 01:32:07.875]  Alex Jones.
[01:32:08.915 --> 01:32:13.736]  My wife tried to go this weekend on Sunday.
[01:32:15.393 --> 01:32:31.527]  She tried to go hike on the Greenbelt that's over several hundred square miles and they had lifeguards blocking the entrance like they're police officers saying you must sign up behind a thing of glass like you have COVID because going outside is dangerous.
[01:32:31.587 --> 01:32:33.349]  All the city-owned golf courses are closed.
[01:32:33.389 --> 01:32:37.973]  They still got the pools closed but for months they quote opened the Greenbelts because nobody was paying attention to them.
[01:32:38.908 --> 01:32:39.969]  Everybody was still going in there.
[01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:41.450]  Well, they weren't letting anybody in.
[01:32:41.470 --> 01:32:42.230]  They said it was full.
[01:32:42.550 --> 01:32:44.371]  Well, the police said, no, there's no enforcement.
[01:32:44.412 --> 01:32:44.952]  Let them in.
[01:32:45.372 --> 01:32:50.756]  The media has released an edited video that doesn't show all that to make it look like I was just screaming at innocent people.
[01:32:51.316 --> 01:32:54.138]  But that's why they're mainstream media and it's why they're in so much trouble.
[01:32:54.638 --> 01:32:59.181]  Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones shouts at Austin employees, hikers at Greenbelt entrance.
[01:32:59.941 --> 01:33:00.922]  Austin American statesman.
[01:33:01.582 --> 01:33:06.686]  That's why they've gone bankrupt three times is people know that they twist and they deceive.
[01:33:07.469 --> 01:33:14.191]  But we have the full video at Infowars.com and Band.video.
[01:33:16.472 --> 01:33:20.453]  Austin Greenbelts reopened after mayor illegally sends in contact tracers.
[01:33:20.913 --> 01:33:23.734]  See all the fake Rangers and all the police standing by?
[01:33:23.974 --> 01:33:25.534]  The police were the ones saying it was pure bull.
[01:33:25.874 --> 01:33:27.355]  They called seven police cars on me.
[01:33:27.535 --> 01:33:29.155]  And then that family was able to march in.
[01:33:30.556 --> 01:33:34.357]  But the media says I screamed at the family and doesn't show you them high-fying me.
[01:33:35.265 --> 01:33:37.847]  I was mean to the Hispanic family.
[01:33:39.988 --> 01:33:41.008]  They never high-fived me.
[01:33:41.048 --> 01:33:41.789]  They never liked me.
[01:33:41.849 --> 01:33:42.149]  No, no.
[01:33:42.429 --> 01:33:44.851]  So that'll be another thing we'll show you next hour.
[01:33:45.171 --> 01:33:49.133]  How they take something that was a victory and turn it into a defeat.
[01:33:50.294 --> 01:33:51.775]  But that's why no one believes them.
[01:33:51.795 --> 01:33:53.096]  That's why they're frauds.
[01:33:54.456 --> 01:33:56.998]  So guys, get the video that's on Twitter versus what we put out.
[01:33:59.667 --> 01:34:05.449]  Yeah, they got a minute-long thing on Twitter versus the five-minute report because they're Decepticons!
[01:34:05.809 --> 01:34:07.330]  Decepticons!
[01:34:07.730 --> 01:34:09.030]  Decepticons!
[01:34:09.050 --> 01:34:15.893]  And I don't mean from the Autobots, Transform and Roll Out, Megatron, prepare to die!
[01:34:16.353 --> 01:34:18.174]  Megatron, prepare for battle!
[01:34:18.314 --> 01:34:19.474]  I don't mean those Decepticons.
[01:34:20.334 --> 01:34:23.115]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[01:34:25.636 --> 01:34:27.177]  We're gonna go to Chris in Chicago.
[01:34:27.237 --> 01:34:27.857]  Chris, welcome.
[01:34:30.250 --> 01:34:36.276]  Hey Alex, I can tell you right now Chicago is primed for the formulaic method of siege.
[01:34:37.036 --> 01:34:44.323]  Essentially every day we see another restaurant in the loop and downtown in the Gold Coast closed.
[01:34:44.383 --> 01:34:48.567]  They're having to raise drawbridges as hordes of people burn things down.
[01:34:48.587 --> 01:34:50.429]  I mean it's like medieval siege.
[01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:56.294]  Yes, and I think what the plan here is to force people out that have means.
[01:34:56.995 --> 01:34:59.377]  Um, you know, I'm in the restaurant business.
[01:34:59.397 --> 01:35:00.657]  I've been in the food business forever.
[01:35:01.198 --> 01:35:04.460]  All the high-end chefs, all the all-star chefs, they're exiting.
[01:35:04.660 --> 01:35:06.821]  They're either going to the suburbs or leaving the state.
[01:35:07.341 --> 01:35:14.766]  So I think what will happen, especially with the guaranteed income situation, is they'll just suspend everyone paying rent, give them guaranteed income.
[01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:18.692]  And these will be the people that will control the city of Chicago.
[01:35:34.244 --> 01:35:40.066]  A big play by Bulldike Admiral Ackbar.
[01:35:40.247 --> 01:35:41.147]  Yeah, yeah, Admiral.
[01:35:41.167 --> 01:35:42.127]  Don't call her that.
[01:35:42.948 --> 01:35:45.469]  Admiral Ackbar leading an attack on the Death Star.
[01:35:45.489 --> 01:35:47.670]  By the way, if new listeners tuned in, we're not joking.
[01:35:48.190 --> 01:35:53.792]  The riots over the weekend over a guy aiming a gun at police and they said later he didn't have one, he did have one.
[01:35:53.812 --> 01:35:54.553]  There's video of it.
[01:35:56.153 --> 01:35:57.634]  They had to raise the drawbridges.
[01:35:57.674 --> 01:35:59.475]  Explain to people about Chicago and the canals.
[01:35:59.695 --> 01:36:02.516]  They literally had to raise the drawbridges to stop more looting.
[01:36:03.715 --> 01:36:08.177]  So so how if you look at a map of Chicago, Wacker Drive runs along the river.
[01:36:08.317 --> 01:36:19.122]  So if you have to go to the west part of Chicago or the north part, which is the Gold Coast, which is where all the high end shops are from the loop from the main downtown area, you can't get across the river that way from downtown.
[01:36:19.142 --> 01:36:20.042]  But here's the thing, Alex.
[01:36:20.403 --> 01:36:23.784]  Block 37, which is in the loop, was one of the main hit areas.
[01:36:24.064 --> 01:36:24.464]  The people.
[01:36:24.804 --> 01:36:28.746]  So the people coming to loot were just exit out of the south side of the city.
[01:36:28.806 --> 01:36:30.287]  I think the mayor just just
[01:36:30.768 --> 01:36:34.849]  Yeah, they're the folks that ran the scams on black Americans with Obama as her head guy, as slumlords.
[01:36:57.742 --> 01:37:06.284]  Yes, and so I need the info warriors to tweet that at Governor Pritzker, because I'm telling you, it's deep here, and they've got this city.
[01:37:06.784 --> 01:37:07.484]  It's a lock.
[01:37:07.864 --> 01:37:10.405]  Hey, Alex, one quick thing I wanted to mention.
[01:37:10.825 --> 01:37:12.065]  It's off this topic.
[01:37:12.185 --> 01:37:20.187]  Michael Karkok, if you ever heard of him, he was an Operation Paperclip guy who came from Germany.
[01:37:20.747 --> 01:37:26.708]  I was listening to an interview recently, I'd never heard this before, about Michael Karkok, K-A-R-K-O-C.
[01:37:27.791 --> 01:37:35.097]  She trained Michael Aquino, who's the big Satanist in the military, and also trained none other than John Brennan.
[01:37:35.717 --> 01:37:37.699]  And this interview I heard, I'll send it to the show tips.
[01:37:37.719 --> 01:37:41.001]  No, no, I mean, I did know that Aquino and John Brennan were trained by Nazis.
[01:37:41.582 --> 01:37:42.483]  That's actually well known.
[01:37:43.704 --> 01:37:52.951]  Okay, so she, when it goes into the harvesting of adrenochrome and all of this stuff, and it was an amazing interview, I'll send it to the show tips, but anyway.
[01:37:53.393 --> 01:37:54.054]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[01:38:20.869 --> 01:38:23.251]  Uh, sounds like you got a phone problem, but try to talk into your receiver.
[01:38:25.433 --> 01:38:25.934]  There's a better?
[01:38:26.214 --> 01:38:26.654]  Yeah, go ahead.
[01:38:26.674 --> 01:38:45.110]  Alright, I'll just take a quick, uh, 60 seconds, but main thing that I wanted to touch on was pretty much on Kathy's call is we gotta, we gotta use our cars and maybe Trump can have like a drive-in rally, um, to really show the numbers of the people turning out through their local drive-ins.
[01:38:45.631 --> 01:38:48.413]  And I also want to plug in, um, Dr. Jones.
[01:38:48.837 --> 01:38:49.857]  The Charcoal Toothpaste.
[01:38:49.877 --> 01:38:51.298]  I'm about to buy some of that today.
[01:38:51.678 --> 01:38:54.599]  And I'm on the waiting list for that InfoWars T-shirt.
[01:38:56.979 --> 01:38:57.920]  Well, that's awesome, brother.
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:58.600]  Yeah.
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:02.581]  We all should be organizing our own events like the Flag Drop we heard out of Chicago.
[01:39:02.601 --> 01:39:04.061]  And I'm going to do it.
[01:39:04.121 --> 01:39:06.422]  I'm going to go out this Friday, 6 to 8.
[01:39:07.542 --> 01:39:10.023]  And we'll announce on the website what corner we're going to be at.
[01:39:10.063 --> 01:39:10.903]  And maybe it's just an hour.
[01:39:11.263 --> 01:39:12.224]  We have American flags.
[01:39:12.264 --> 01:39:12.764]  We get out.
[01:39:13.204 --> 01:39:14.764]  You know, we support freedom.
[01:39:14.884 --> 01:39:16.725]  And we exercise being out in the open.
[01:39:18.234 --> 01:39:20.795]  In fact, the best place to go is probably the south side of the Capitol.
[01:39:21.276 --> 01:39:21.796]  Just do that.
[01:39:21.836 --> 01:39:23.177]  That's the best place, I think, to meet.
[01:39:24.598 --> 01:39:25.638]  We'll call it the Flag Drop.
[01:39:25.979 --> 01:39:27.239]  Everybody brings your American flags out.
[01:39:27.279 --> 01:39:28.360]  It's not an InfoWars event.
[01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:30.421]  It's an American event, Matthew.
[01:39:31.582 --> 01:39:33.323]  MAGA rallies at the drive-in.
[01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.609]  I agree.
[01:39:35.750 --> 01:39:38.472]  Drive-in theaters were already making a comeback because of the stupid COVID hoax.
[01:39:38.872 --> 01:39:39.753]  They're back again.
[01:39:40.833 --> 01:39:43.696]  And so my daughter was asking me to take her to one last week.
[01:39:43.736 --> 01:39:44.756]  Maybe we will this weekend.
[01:39:45.417 --> 01:39:46.077]  And I agree.
[01:39:46.097 --> 01:39:48.259]  People just all pick a one drive-in you're going to go to.
[01:39:48.539 --> 01:39:52.342]  You all fly the American flag and all meet up there.
[01:39:52.422 --> 01:39:56.365]  It's key for us to meet and be human and get outside of our houses.
[01:39:56.726 --> 01:39:58.407]  The globalists want us inside our houses.
[01:39:58.647 --> 01:40:00.128]  They want the post-human world.
[01:40:00.488 --> 01:40:02.350]  Sounds like a science fiction movie because it is.
[01:40:02.670 --> 01:40:03.611]  Thank you so much, Matthew.
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:14.983]  All right, we don't have time to put anybody else on the board, but I will get to Clint, Isaiah, Flo, Jacob, Howard, Mark, and Tim after our guest is on with us.
[01:40:16.244 --> 01:40:19.145]  So if you wanna hold, we will get to everybody in the order they're received.
[01:40:19.165 --> 01:40:23.246]  First up will be Jacob, then it'll be Tim, and then it'll go in the order.
[01:40:23.346 --> 01:40:26.367]  Some people called in 10 minutes ago, some people called in an hour ago.
[01:40:26.387 --> 01:40:27.588]  I will get to everybody.
[01:40:29.228 --> 01:40:30.269]  But we're gonna get into
[01:40:31.516 --> 01:40:41.645]  How the next level of lockdowns is here in the blue cities and blue states and will soon by the winter, even if Trump loses, they're going to do this, will be locked down permanently.
[01:40:41.685 --> 01:40:43.426]  And we're talking months inside your high rise.
[01:40:44.187 --> 01:40:48.391]  That's what they target first, where you can't ever leave your house or you'll be body slammed.
[01:40:48.431 --> 01:40:56.758]  Even if you wear a mask, you've seen all that footage out of Australia, just men brutally choking women out because they have been told cult-like to put them under martial law.
[01:40:57.118 --> 01:40:58.860]  That is the example for the rest of the world.
[01:41:00.034 --> 01:41:02.056]  China's not doing the lockdowns to teach us how to be slaves.
[01:41:02.396 --> 01:41:08.982]  Now Australia is doing it, and it is just vicious, and it is satanic, and those officers are Nazis.
[01:41:09.002 --> 01:41:12.966]  They are absolute scum of the earth filth, and they're carrying out illegal orders, and it's disgusting.
[01:41:13.286 --> 01:41:19.012]  I'll tell you this, the Austin cops I ran into were all listeners, and we're, you know, and the camera wasn't on shaking my hand.
[01:41:19.352 --> 01:41:22.896]  But let me tell you, those police in Australia are shameful sacks of leftist garbage.
[01:41:24.077 --> 01:41:24.917]  Deanna Lorraine
[01:41:26.127 --> 01:41:29.590]  Is a great talk show host and activist and she's run for Congress.
[01:41:29.610 --> 01:41:30.651]  She's done a lot of great work.
[01:41:31.171 --> 01:41:36.316]  She was just on Australian TV and cut off when she brought up some of the discrepancies with the coronavirus.
[01:41:36.336 --> 01:41:43.782]  Because you know the UN's in charge and they're choking women out that leave their homes period even with masks and now temperature testing.
[01:41:44.623 --> 01:41:46.524]  All of this is the next level of control.
[01:41:46.905 --> 01:41:52.029]  So she's here to talk about the latest Gavin Newsom draconian measures where they are still trying to keep the beaches locked down.
[01:41:52.349 --> 01:41:54.291]  But here they're keeping all the major parks
[01:41:54.691 --> 01:42:00.334]  And the equivalent of state parks here in Austin, the city has parks that are as big as State or National Forest.
[01:42:00.714 --> 01:42:02.755]  Those are locked down for COVID.
[01:42:03.035 --> 01:42:06.237]  It's absolutely asinine and a power grab.
[01:42:06.517 --> 01:42:08.118]  So, Deanna Lorraine joins us.
[01:42:08.438 --> 01:42:09.238]  Thanks for coming on.
[01:42:09.378 --> 01:42:10.439]  What do you want to tackle first?
[01:42:11.919 --> 01:42:12.460]  Well, I don't know.
[01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:20.163]  You want to tackle the Australian cutoff when they pretended it was a bad feed, or we can talk about communist Gavin Grusin.
[01:42:20.744 --> 01:42:21.664]  Which do you want to talk about?
[01:42:21.684 --> 01:42:22.925]  Let's get into Australia first.
[01:42:23.894 --> 01:42:27.877]  Okay, so Australian invited me, how kind of them.
[01:42:27.897 --> 01:42:31.240]  I put up a tweet, okay, a couple weeks ago I put up a tweet.
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:43.109]  Once I found out that they were going on another lockdown for six weeks, they were not even letting people go outside of their homes, okay, except for maybe essential services here and there, and they said they were having a wall of steel
[01:42:43.829 --> 01:42:48.731]  Uh, meaning police forces all the way outside the city of Melbourne to make sure nobody comes in or out.
[01:42:49.011 --> 01:42:54.174]  So I put up a tweet defending their individual liberties saying, hey, this is like prison.
[01:42:54.254 --> 01:42:55.454]  This is basically prison.
[01:42:55.494 --> 01:42:57.956]  You know, Australians fight, fight for your liberties.
[01:42:58.356 --> 01:43:08.680]  So the Australian... While her Skype comes back, let's go ahead and roll the video of her on Australian television when they cut it off, claiming a technical difficulty.
[01:43:08.700 --> 01:43:11.522]  Kind of like when Biden has trouble speaking, they claim it's a technical difficulty.
[01:43:11.562 --> 01:43:11.862]  Here it is.
[01:43:14.682 --> 01:43:20.565]  Okay, number one, the CDC is counting presumptive positive tests, presumptive positive cases as positive.
[01:43:20.585 --> 01:43:25.027]  So if you even have the sniffles, if you have a headache, then you are tested positive now.
[01:43:25.667 --> 01:43:39.533]  We also have the President of Tanzania, who also has... I think the link is dropping out because I don't think I should be giving her any airtime.
[01:43:40.205 --> 01:43:40.806]  Well, Ali.
[01:43:41.046 --> 01:43:41.586]  Come on.
[01:43:41.846 --> 01:43:42.167]  Ali.
[01:43:42.247 --> 01:43:43.348]  That is ridiculous.
[01:43:43.368 --> 01:43:45.589]  Ali, you knew that interview was happening last night.
[01:43:45.609 --> 01:43:48.932]  You can't then just go and say, oh, I don't like what she's saying now.
[01:43:49.032 --> 01:43:49.873]  She has a right to her opinion.
[01:43:49.893 --> 01:43:54.176]  Do you know that there are complete whack jobs in this country who think the same thing?
[01:43:54.196 --> 01:43:57.279]  So, is that her Skype breaking up like it just did, or were they cutting her off?
[01:43:57.799 --> 01:44:00.322]  I know that the United Nations censors people.
[01:44:00.742 --> 01:44:02.284]  I know they censor Greg Rees.
[01:44:02.604 --> 01:44:03.525]  I know they censor us.
[01:44:03.605 --> 01:44:09.771]  I know the head of YouTube says, if something disagrees with the United Nations, we shut it down.
[01:44:10.251 --> 01:44:12.513]  And that's why we need our own communications.
[01:44:12.553 --> 01:44:14.696]  By the way, I'm inviting her to town next week.
[01:44:15.276 --> 01:44:16.497]  So she could be in studio with us.
[01:44:17.237 --> 01:44:22.061]  I ran into her out at the Big Virginia Rally for Guns and really familiar with her work.
[01:44:22.101 --> 01:44:23.762]  And we're going to get her in studio next week.
[01:44:24.062 --> 01:44:29.886]  That way, one way or another, we can actually hear what she has to say because she's smart as a whip.
[01:44:30.586 --> 01:44:31.847]  And I really look forward to that.
[01:44:31.887 --> 01:44:35.089]  If we're able to get her Skype stabilized, we'll get her back with us.
[01:44:35.490 --> 01:44:37.851]  But right now, let's go ahead and talk to another caller.
[01:44:38.431 --> 01:44:42.474]  Let's go ahead and speak with Jacob in Georgia.
[01:44:42.514 --> 01:44:43.095]  Thanks for holding.
[01:44:43.115 --> 01:44:43.435]  Go ahead.
[01:44:48.507 --> 01:44:48.687]  Hello.
[01:44:48.707 --> 01:44:49.488]  Yes, sir.
[01:44:49.508 --> 01:44:49.668]  Go ahead.
[01:44:49.708 --> 01:44:49.888]  Welcome.
[01:44:51.589 --> 01:44:51.970]  Oh, yeah.
[01:44:52.210 --> 01:45:09.984]  I'm just, um, I was just, I've been listening to you since I was in, um, ninth grade and I'm a caller from Georgia and, um, I go to KSU in Georgia and I was just going to tell you how bad they're using COVID to, uh, to basically, I guess you could say, push the globalist platform.
[01:45:10.585 --> 01:45:16.850]  And, um, I just got an email from, uh, one of the directors from Georgia and he said that, um, or one of the directors from KSU,
[01:45:17.614 --> 01:45:21.659]  He said that now what they're going to be doing is using contract tracing.
[01:45:22.459 --> 01:45:25.162]  Masks are required or you will not be let on campus.
[01:45:26.404 --> 01:45:29.247]  And another one says that they will be using the armband.
[01:45:29.407 --> 01:45:30.869]  So it's real.
[01:45:31.129 --> 01:45:32.070]  It's real and it's scary.
[01:45:32.931 --> 01:45:33.351]  That's right.
[01:45:33.772 --> 01:45:35.874]  All across the world it comes in in phases.
[01:45:35.934 --> 01:45:36.915]  First stay in your house.
[01:45:37.596 --> 01:45:38.637]  Then wear the mask.
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:39.760]  Yeah.
[01:45:39.860 --> 01:45:40.421]  It's crazy, ma'am.
[01:46:11.345 --> 01:46:12.476]  Does your wife have something to say?
[01:46:15.174 --> 01:46:15.614]  He's gone.
[01:46:16.095 --> 01:46:16.435]  All right.
[01:46:17.316 --> 01:46:18.417]  Deanna Lorraine is here.
[01:46:18.757 --> 01:46:25.782]  We're flying her to Austin next week to co-host the show with me a couple days, and to be on The War Room, and to be with David Knight, because I love her work whenever I see it.
[01:46:26.843 --> 01:46:33.948]  But I don't know if they cut her off in Australia, because, I mean, I think it might be her Skype connection, but she'll be with us next week.
[01:46:33.968 --> 01:46:36.630]  So I'm announcing that, so I'm going to make sure that happens.
[01:46:36.670 --> 01:46:39.733]  Also, tomorrow night, I'm going to do a special 7 to 10 p.m.
[01:46:40.033 --> 01:46:43.255]  live transmission on their attempts to overturn the election.
[01:46:44.256 --> 01:46:47.717]  Let's shift gears of that a few minutes we have and we'll come back again to the other topics on COVID.
[01:46:48.177 --> 01:47:05.143]  What do you make of Democrats Pelosi there in your district in California saying that she's second command, they're going to contest the election, they'll have another inauguration for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and that they're going to have liberal states secede.
[01:47:05.203 --> 01:47:06.063]  That's civil war.
[01:47:06.103 --> 01:47:07.544]  I mean, they're really planning this.
[01:47:07.564 --> 01:47:08.064]  What do you think?
[01:47:09.238 --> 01:47:09.758]  Absolutely.
[01:47:09.818 --> 01:47:10.799]  I mean, this was planned.
[01:47:10.819 --> 01:47:12.680]  This was locked and loaded from day one.
[01:47:13.140 --> 01:47:15.461]  Obviously, Joe Biden is just a puppet, okay?
[01:47:15.601 --> 01:47:18.462]  It's not President Trump versus Joe Biden.
[01:47:18.522 --> 01:47:19.923]  It's President Trump versus
[01:47:20.330 --> 01:47:22.451]  This Marxist globalist takeover.
[01:47:22.871 --> 01:47:25.632]  You know it, I know it, everyone knows it who has half a brain.
[01:47:26.012 --> 01:47:28.713]  And they're going to usher this in regardless of what happens.
[01:47:29.053 --> 01:47:36.535]  So I'm obviously freaked out and very afraid of what's going to happen if President Trump loses because then America as we know it is over.
[01:47:37.035 --> 01:47:41.457]  But if he wins, I mean, they're going full steam ahead with this no matter what.
[01:47:42.057 --> 01:47:42.358]  Right?
[01:47:42.838 --> 01:47:49.266]  California, you know, we patriots need to do something because the left, they're going through with their agenda no matter what.
[01:47:49.306 --> 01:47:51.108]  It seems like we almost don't have a say in it.
[01:47:51.569 --> 01:48:01.060]  And meanwhile, while we're holding nice little rallies and waving the American flags and honking horns, which is nice, you know, they are causing massive destruction and seizing police stations.
[01:48:01.519 --> 01:48:01.779]  Right?
[01:48:02.239 --> 01:48:03.900]  And destroying monuments and everything.
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:06.680]  And they're making much more of a dent in this war than we are.
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:07.621]  Don't you think?
[01:48:07.801 --> 01:48:14.002]  I mean, we're not doing enough, and I think that we need to get mobilized and organized because they're obviously very well-funded and well-organized.
[01:48:14.222 --> 01:48:14.722]  Well, that's right.
[01:48:14.742 --> 01:48:17.143]  They keep pushing and pushing and they never get in trouble.
[01:48:17.703 --> 01:48:22.944]  And so the attempted coup against Trump with Russiagate and Ukrainegate, and now this is just, they're going to try it?
[01:48:23.124 --> 01:48:23.925]  Because why shouldn't they?
[01:48:23.945 --> 01:48:25.025]  They're not going to get in trouble for it.
[01:48:26.092 --> 01:48:26.332]  Right.
[01:48:26.713 --> 01:48:27.154]  Exactly.
[01:48:27.234 --> 01:48:30.058]  All they're doing is pushing and pushing and seeing what they can get away with.
[01:48:30.118 --> 01:48:31.740]  But look, they're getting away with a lot.
[01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:32.501]  That's the fact.
[01:48:32.602 --> 01:48:36.467]  And if you looked at just pure optics, it looks like they're winning this war.
[01:48:36.888 --> 01:48:38.250]  What are we really doing?
[01:48:38.390 --> 01:48:41.475]  And we're kind of, you know, we've got 90 days or so till the election.
[01:48:42.095 --> 01:48:44.656]  And President Trump is making some moves.
[01:48:45.036 --> 01:48:47.696]  But, you know, there's some fear about vaccines.
[01:48:47.756 --> 01:48:51.777]  You know, obviously, if the Democrats have it their way, they're going to try to push for mandatory vaccines.
[01:48:52.037 --> 01:48:53.837]  They're going to try to push for microchips.
[01:48:54.237 --> 01:48:58.978]  Obviously, in New Jersey, they're trying to push their already mandated armbands at schools.
[01:48:59.398 --> 01:49:03.919]  OK, that's one step away from mandated vaccines and microchips, right, and tracking devices.
[01:49:04.299 --> 01:49:07.440]  Contact tracing has already been rolled out, even though the H.R.
[01:49:08.120 --> 01:49:09.560]  666 bill hasn't even been passed yet.
[01:49:10.521 --> 01:49:14.748]  So we have to fight and we have to be mobilized or else we are going to lose this war.
[01:49:15.530 --> 01:49:18.856]  Especially if we win, you know, there's going to be full massive civil war, I think.
[01:49:19.218 --> 01:49:21.939]  If President Trump wins because they've got every trick up their sleeve.
[01:49:40.205 --> 01:49:45.087]  By 567 at night, but I will be here tomorrow night commercial free 7 to 10 p.m.
[01:49:45.548 --> 01:49:52.531]  And we're just intending the crew signed onto it to be going live seven days a week here in just a couple weeks because this is history happening right now.
[01:49:52.951 --> 01:49:54.072]  Deanna Lorraine, stay with us.
[01:49:54.092 --> 01:49:54.552]  We'll be right back.
[01:49:56.121 --> 01:49:58.703]  Deanna Lorraine is our guest.
[01:49:58.883 --> 01:50:00.364]  She's an amazing activist lady.
[01:50:00.745 --> 01:50:06.009]  Ran for Congress, got a lot of great word out there in the San Francisco area, but was defeated by another Islamist.
[01:50:06.609 --> 01:50:13.715]  Just like we just saw Ilhan Omar, despite the fact she was way outspent by a moderate socialist progressive communist.
[01:50:14.555 --> 01:50:21.783]  She just won massively in the primary in Minnesota because people are doubling down on someone who says abolish the police.
[01:50:22.123 --> 01:50:22.984]  America sucks.
[01:50:23.044 --> 01:50:24.286]  Thanks for saving the America.
[01:50:24.606 --> 01:50:25.447]  You totally suck.
[01:50:25.907 --> 01:50:29.671]  She's got her new book out that's excellent, Taking Back America.
[01:50:29.932 --> 01:50:34.797]  What's the best website or best place for people to visit Deanna Lorraine to find your great book and all your great work?
[01:50:36.058 --> 01:50:38.400]  Yeah, my Twitter is extremely active.
[01:50:38.421 --> 01:50:43.246]  I get retweeted by the President every once in a while, so go to my Twitter at Deanna4Congress.
[01:50:43.266 --> 01:50:44.447]  That's Deanna4Congress.
[01:50:44.847 --> 01:50:49.172]  You can get my book at Amazon, and you can go to my website at DeannaLorraine.com.
[01:50:51.806 --> 01:50:53.107]  You were saying, what do you want to cover next?
[01:50:53.167 --> 01:50:53.987]  You've got the floor.
[01:50:54.007 --> 01:51:04.932]  I mean, we could get into how they're electing all these weird, crazy Islamic women and why the left's behind that, what Soros is going to do, the election, the rest, the COVID lockdown.
[01:51:04.952 --> 01:51:06.133]  I mean, you've got the floor.
[01:51:07.318 --> 01:51:15.885]  Well, obviously with the COVID lockdown, you know, the thing that upsets me about the President, and you know I support the President so much, but all of these numbers are phony, right?
[01:51:15.985 --> 01:51:19.968]  You know that the death toll is inflated and false.
[01:51:20.308 --> 01:51:22.670]  We know that the test numbers are inflated and false.
[01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:29.035]  I mean, people are reporting everywhere that they didn't even go and take the test, and then they get called a couple days later and they get tested positive.
[01:51:29.595 --> 01:51:29.795]  Right?
[01:51:29.875 --> 01:51:32.476]  We know that non-human samples have been tested positive.
[01:51:32.856 --> 01:51:45.378]  So why are we basing all these draconian measures and changing schools and having creepy paper fans and digital fans in the sports stadiums and changing our whole lives mandated masks on false numbers?
[01:51:45.859 --> 01:51:46.099]  Right?
[01:51:46.719 --> 01:51:53.960]  So I don't, you know, I don't think this nightmare is going to go away until the President of the United States really says, look, you know, this is false.
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.101]  These are all false numbers and we can't change our entire world.
[01:51:57.601 --> 01:52:00.162]  And usher in this new normal based on false numbers.
[01:52:00.702 --> 01:52:03.723]  Meanwhile, Gavin Newsom is banning singing in churches.
[01:52:04.243 --> 01:52:08.905]  He just made an authorization that we cannot have any gatherings.
[01:52:09.165 --> 01:52:16.827]  So, like, forget having a barbecue or anything with your family unless you get it authorized by him or else he's going to shut off water and power.
[01:52:17.347 --> 01:52:17.588]  Right?
[01:52:17.648 --> 01:52:19.948]  I mean, how disgusting and Nazi is that?
[01:52:20.508 --> 01:52:21.929]  So this is the world we're into.
[01:52:21.949 --> 01:52:23.810]  Of course, Soros is behind it.
[01:52:23.850 --> 01:52:25.150]  The globalists are behind it.
[01:52:25.618 --> 01:52:29.300]  And they're extremely happy to usher in this new normal, right?
[01:52:29.441 --> 01:52:31.562]  And people are just going to go along with it.
[01:52:31.742 --> 01:52:36.525]  Nothing's going to get done unless we patriots fight back and say, no, I will not wear a mask.
[01:52:37.346 --> 01:52:37.746]  I will.
[01:52:37.846 --> 01:52:42.529]  I'm willing to get arrested to keep my business open so I don't comply to these draconian measures.
[01:52:42.549 --> 01:52:44.931]  You don't have a right to shut off my power, my water.
[01:52:44.951 --> 01:52:48.933]  And I think that we need to really send a strong message that we're not going to put up with it.
[01:52:48.953 --> 01:52:49.453]  We're not going to go.
[01:52:49.574 --> 01:52:53.196]  We're not going to obey this and not going to submit our children to child abuse.
[01:52:53.689 --> 01:52:57.231]  Right, and wear a mask all day long and not have normal social interaction, right?
[01:52:57.851 --> 01:52:58.831]  And that's just the beginning.
[01:52:58.891 --> 01:53:01.692]  I mean, now it's wear the bracelets, do all the rest of it.
[01:53:02.013 --> 01:53:03.813]  Let's play this clip from Fox News.
[01:53:03.833 --> 01:53:22.121]  Tucker Carlson's a great guy, but the doctor he has on, you know, sometimes says some good things, but my goodness, he was on there, he was on there last night, and he was saying that children that haven't had their vaccine need to wear a yellow sign, like a Jew in Nazi Germany, saying no hugs.
[01:53:22.521 --> 01:53:24.323]  This is absolutely insane.
[01:53:24.723 --> 01:53:25.223]  Here it is.
[01:53:26.444 --> 01:53:29.487]  Now, what do these 97,000 kids all have in common?
[01:53:29.687 --> 01:53:32.389]  All of them, almost all of them, have mild cases.
[01:53:32.429 --> 01:53:39.034]  The same time CDC, and this did not go reported, 600 kids have been hospitalized since the beginning.
[01:53:39.234 --> 01:53:41.416]  Way less than adults have been hospitalized.
[01:53:41.456 --> 01:53:43.457]  They get much milder cases.
[01:53:43.978 --> 01:53:49.983]  Now, what we have to do to reopen the schools, of course, is to provide virtual learning for those most at risk.
[01:53:50.583 --> 01:53:51.784]  Teachers most at risk.
[01:53:51.824 --> 01:53:53.766]  We have to have an infrastructure in place.
[01:53:54.146 --> 01:53:57.629]  We have to teach our kids about how to take proper precautions.
[01:53:57.949 --> 01:54:03.694]  But we need our schools to be centers for learning and centers for socialization and social skills.
[01:54:04.454 --> 01:54:10.459]  That will decrease the amount of despair and deaths from non-COVID related causes.
[01:54:10.539 --> 01:54:14.683]  We have to test everyone as well, and we should have prodigious testing.
[01:54:15.043 --> 01:54:17.185]  Here's one other thing we have to do, sadly.
[01:54:18.326 --> 01:54:19.367]  No hugs, please.
[01:54:19.427 --> 01:54:23.528]  Now, if you look at this pin, Tucker, you'll see this pin looks like something you might remember.
[01:54:23.608 --> 01:54:24.769]  No smoking, please.
[01:54:25.149 --> 01:54:29.091]  Let's give our kids all of these pins, no hugs please, sadly.
[01:54:29.391 --> 01:54:34.693]  But I'm going to say this, with this pin or shirts, no hugs please, guess what's going to happen?
[01:54:34.733 --> 01:54:39.935]  We're going to get 26 candidates for a vaccine coming out into clinical trials right now.
[01:54:40.455 --> 01:54:41.876]  Vaccines are going to emerge.
[01:54:42.356 --> 01:54:47.720]  We're going to beat this thing, and then this goes in the garbage, and we're all going to hug each other.
[01:54:47.760 --> 01:54:50.421]  In the meantime, Tucker, let's show our kids courage.
[01:54:50.442 --> 01:54:53.143]  They're looking to parents for leadership.
[01:54:53.423 --> 01:54:56.906]  Leadership says, open the schools wherever we can, Tucker.
[01:54:57.246 --> 01:55:07.493]  So even the angle of open the school is, got to wear this badge because you haven't been vaccinated, you're dirty, you're bad, and oh, those at risk can't come to school now, you'll be on a computer, so be neurotic.
[01:55:07.813 --> 01:55:11.736]  They're trying to turn the whole country, the whole world, into
[01:55:12.996 --> 01:55:19.738]  What we've seen before with crazy eccentrics that are scared to go out in public because they're worried about diseases, like Howard Hughes.
[01:55:19.818 --> 01:55:22.478]  I mean this is, welcome to planet Howard Hughes.
[01:55:23.239 --> 01:55:23.479]  Right.
[01:55:23.819 --> 01:55:28.440]  Agoraphobic, germaphobic, major OCD, that's what they're turning him into.
[01:55:28.760 --> 01:55:36.742]  And yet, Gavin Newsom is one of the many governors that he's releasing 18,000 prisoners, violent prisoners, from jails and prison.
[01:55:37.302 --> 01:55:38.342]  Right now, okay?
[01:55:38.583 --> 01:55:41.023]  So don't tell me that it's about our health and safety.
[01:55:41.123 --> 01:55:48.826]  Don't tell me it's about our health and safety when you're actually encouraging people to be together en masse for Black Lives Matter protests and rallies and looting.
[01:55:49.126 --> 01:55:51.027]  Okay, don't tell me it's about our safety anymore.
[01:55:51.487 --> 01:55:53.728]  It's so disgusting and this is child abuse.
[01:55:54.170 --> 01:55:59.095]  If you look at the CIA's definition of torture, this meets the qualification of torture.
[01:55:59.476 --> 01:56:09.507]  If you look at any of the studies up until about six months ago, it is a well-known fact that social isolation creates major psychological issues, mental issues.
[01:56:09.907 --> 01:56:16.748]  Suicidal, homicidal, you know, there's so many different side effects that happen with social isolation, okay?
[01:56:16.848 --> 01:56:24.630]  And all of that was well known and well documented, oh, up until about six months ago when all of a sudden COVID came out and now social isolation is somehow good.
[01:56:24.990 --> 01:56:26.090]  You can't just erase this.
[01:56:26.130 --> 01:56:35.112]  You can't just erase years of knowledge and science and replace it with junk science just because these people walk around in white lab coats and have fancy names after them like Anthony Fauci.
[01:56:35.646 --> 01:56:39.289]  I mean, it's disgusting, but... Oh, that's right, and everything Fauci said is a fraud.
[01:56:39.309 --> 01:56:40.130]  Look at these headlines.
[01:56:46.946 --> 01:56:47.126]  Right.
[01:56:47.666 --> 01:56:53.068]  And I don't want to see, I don't want to look in a sports stadium and see digital fans or paper cutouts.
[01:56:53.348 --> 01:56:58.270]  I don't want to go to a restaurant or bar and I want to see like blow up dolls or something as a replacement for people.
[01:56:58.350 --> 01:56:58.890]  Excuse me.
[01:56:58.910 --> 01:57:00.190]  I want to see people.
[01:57:00.210 --> 01:57:02.551]  I want to see people laughing, smiling, having a good time.
[01:57:02.811 --> 01:57:03.892]  But that's what they're doing.
[01:57:03.912 --> 01:57:06.913]  They're trying to devoid, have us devoid of human contact.
[01:57:06.953 --> 01:57:08.053]  They want this virtual
[01:57:08.473 --> 01:57:09.514]  Touchless world.
[01:57:09.794 --> 01:57:11.054]  It's very dystopian.
[01:57:11.374 --> 01:57:15.136]  And the thing that pisses me off the most, sorry I'm so fired up, but this just really fires me up.
[01:57:15.156 --> 01:57:16.637]  Yeah, this is the robot rollout.
[01:57:16.897 --> 01:57:18.318]  The robots are allowed to go.
[01:57:18.378 --> 01:57:19.358]  They'll deliver you food.
[01:57:19.658 --> 01:57:21.679]  They'll drive the cars because they're safe.
[01:57:21.980 --> 01:57:22.860]  But humans aren't.
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:24.121]  Humans are bad.
[01:57:25.181 --> 01:57:26.682]  Dreaming of the post-human world.
[01:57:27.435 --> 01:57:29.877]  They're even saying that we need to have sex wearing a mask.
[01:57:29.957 --> 01:57:30.698]  I mean, are you kidding me?
[01:57:30.738 --> 01:57:33.701]  They're saying that people need to not have sex or have sex wearing a mask.
[01:57:33.721 --> 01:57:34.962]  I hope I can say that on this show.
[01:57:35.662 --> 01:57:41.488]  Major universities are saying, you're bad, you're dirty, wear a mask while you have sex.
[01:57:41.508 --> 01:57:50.576]  So they're making the normal biological world dirty and bad, even though almost all the studies show more contact with people makes your immune system stronger, not the other way around.
[01:57:51.474 --> 01:57:52.415]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:57:52.635 --> 01:58:09.313]  But the people that are carrying the water for these globalists, the people that are going along with it, that are so brainwashed, and then shaming people for not wearing a mask or something, those are the people that upset me and disgust me even more, because they're the ones carrying this agenda, and it's going to be too late by the time that they figure out, right?
[01:58:10.234 --> 01:58:10.554]  I agree.
[01:58:10.594 --> 01:58:16.378]  What do you think President Trump needs to do with them trying to openly war game, having states secede?
[01:58:16.698 --> 01:58:21.861]  I mean, I think you should attack that head-on and point out that it's their next big hoax, their next big coup.
[01:58:22.121 --> 01:58:25.203]  Don't wait until they officially roll it out, which is already starting to happen.
[01:58:26.314 --> 01:58:31.036]  Yeah, no, we need to lead a movement right now and I'm already starting to activate some troops.
[01:58:31.057 --> 01:58:34.658]  You know, I have to be careful about the way that I say that, but we need to lead a movement.
[01:58:34.678 --> 01:58:37.460]  We need to, to, to, you know, have the militias.
[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:45.024]  We have to have a three percenters, all these people that really care about our country to go out in mass and actually fight for this and make a big deal about it.
[01:58:45.104 --> 01:58:46.765]  I am going to start sounding the alarm on it.
[01:58:47.285 --> 01:58:50.747]  Um, and I know that you are too, because this is getting so nuts.
[01:58:50.947 --> 01:58:54.929]  And every time they roll this out, by the time people figure it out, it's usually too late.
[01:58:55.467 --> 01:58:59.308]  So yes, I will be sounding the alarm a lot about it, and you're going to hear a lot about it in the next coming weeks.
[01:58:59.328 --> 01:59:04.669]  I want to talk about what it's like being in California right now, and the exit is happening.
[01:59:05.029 --> 01:59:07.730]  You know, Joe Rogan is moving to Texas.
[01:59:08.510 --> 01:59:10.311]  He finally went ahead and announced this at the end of the month.
[01:59:10.331 --> 01:59:12.491]  I mean, I know where he's moving and where and all the rest of it.
[01:59:13.072 --> 01:59:14.292]  And I'll just leave it at that.
[01:59:14.392 --> 01:59:15.812]  But it's pretty exciting.
[01:59:15.832 --> 01:59:19.193]  But he talks about what it's like there, and everybody else he knows is leaving as well.
[01:59:19.513 --> 01:59:20.934]  So maybe you need to be leaving.
[01:59:21.234 --> 01:59:21.874]  We'll be right back.
[01:59:21.914 --> 01:59:22.334]  Stay with us.
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:26.441]  Deanna Lorraine is our guest.
[01:59:26.461 --> 01:59:29.524]  You can find her new book, Taking Back America, on her website.
[01:59:30.385 --> 01:59:34.009]  Deanna, what about the cultural rot?
[01:59:34.049 --> 01:59:35.610]  What about the war on the family?
[01:59:35.710 --> 01:59:36.871]  I know that you recently
[01:59:37.970 --> 01:59:56.487]  Did your own reaction video to Cartier B, which it's really even hard to play this video, it's almost all cussing, where she's teaching young girls to go out and tax men for sex how to be prostitutes, and this is the thing being pushed by the culture, but then people that say that they believe in a family, they're bad.
[01:59:58.128 --> 01:59:59.469]  Oh, it's absolutely disgusting.
[02:00:00.938 --> 02:00:07.902]  I kind of created a little monster a couple days ago, inadvertently, because I critiqued Cardi B on her new song, WAP.
[02:00:08.662 --> 02:00:16.746]  I'm not even gonna say what the WAP stands for, but the whole song is about hoes and, you know, basically turning girls into hoes.
[02:00:17.566 --> 02:00:19.307]  Really like the underlying premise there.
[02:00:19.648 --> 02:00:27.533]  And so I said, you know, at a time, first of all, I mean, these women and this song is putting back women about 100 years, okay?
[02:00:27.773 --> 02:00:35.198]  Because feminists have always been calling for respect and getting respect and everything, and they're just setting the whole thing backwards with songs like this that's absolute filth.
[02:00:35.718 --> 02:00:39.361]  And secondly, we have a major problem with the broken family unit.
[02:00:39.821 --> 02:00:45.065]  And one out of every three kids grow up in fatherless homes, but especially in the black community.
[02:00:45.085 --> 02:00:49.688]  In the black community, it's about 80% of children grow up in fatherless homes in the black community.
[02:00:50.169 --> 02:00:53.391]  And do we really need more single baby mamas?
[02:00:53.431 --> 02:00:55.393]  Do we really need more fatherless homes?
[02:00:55.953 --> 02:01:00.036]  And this song and songs like this are really perpetuating that culture.
[02:01:00.549 --> 02:01:04.071]  And oh my God, you would have said I was calling for a black lynching.
[02:01:04.531 --> 02:01:11.014]  I've gotten thousands of hate mail messages from Cardi B fans saying, how dare you say that about blacks?
[02:01:11.054 --> 02:01:12.535]  How dare you say that about Cardi B?
[02:01:13.157 --> 02:01:14.198]  I've gotten death threats.
[02:01:14.258 --> 02:01:16.320]  People have called my personal cell phone number.
[02:01:17.121 --> 02:01:18.222]  Not sure how they've gotten that.
[02:01:18.623 --> 02:01:19.604]  But they're calling me.
[02:01:19.624 --> 02:01:22.587]  They're going crazy saying that I'm insulting them and that I'm racist.
[02:01:22.627 --> 02:01:23.208]  I'm racist.
[02:01:23.528 --> 02:01:25.170]  But all I'm doing is saying a fact.
[02:01:25.230 --> 02:01:26.672]  And that's the problem with today's day.
[02:01:26.952 --> 02:01:30.095]  You can't say a fact without being called a racist.
[02:01:30.175 --> 02:01:31.617]  Now facts are racist.
[02:01:32.057 --> 02:01:36.838]  I can't say, look, I actually care more about the black community than you probably do.
[02:01:36.898 --> 02:01:44.759]  Has it ever occurred to you that I think the black community should be thriving and they could be thriving, but the broken family unit is a big problem?
[02:01:45.119 --> 02:01:55.241]  And songs like this that are absolute filth, that are teaching women that women's empowerment is being a hoe and being a sex worker and seeing how many guys you can sleep with.
[02:01:55.741 --> 02:02:00.782]  Has it ever occurred to you that that's probably not the good thing for the black community and that's creating more brokenness?
[02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:02.530]  But they don't want to hear it, Alex.
[02:02:02.570 --> 02:02:03.551]  They don't want to hear it.
[02:02:04.432 --> 02:02:09.276]  And that's the cultural revolution that we're in right now that we also need to be fighting, that I'm fighting every day.
[02:02:10.978 --> 02:02:13.060]  Well, I mean, take Black Lives Matter.
[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:15.702]  Almost none of the people involved are black.
[02:02:15.762 --> 02:02:17.604]  And then the three women that founded it are all
[02:02:18.669 --> 02:02:19.349]  The same thing.
[02:02:19.369 --> 02:02:27.132]  It's like Lightfoot, or it's like the Attorney General in New York, James, or any of these people.
[02:02:27.172 --> 02:02:31.074]  They're all, for whatever reason, obese black lesbian women.
[02:02:31.654 --> 02:02:32.675]  You know, the lady up in St.
[02:02:32.695 --> 02:02:43.199]  Louis had died in the family, defended themselves, their house, and they're racist, they hate white people, they hate men, and they say the message is trans men, men cutting their testicles off,
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:48.263]  And they go on to say that they want to end the nuclear family.
[02:02:48.563 --> 02:02:52.266]  So when you point out, hey, this tries to end the nuclear family, you're not kidding.
[02:02:52.326 --> 02:02:55.809]  They're advertising this is the road to happiness when it's not.
[02:02:55.849 --> 02:02:57.731]  It's the road to prison and destruction.
[02:02:57.911 --> 02:03:01.654]  So they're literally there, Judas Goats, trying to lead people into destruction.
[02:03:02.095 --> 02:03:05.818]  And the video I wanted, it's not the music video, it's the one I saw like last Friday.
[02:03:05.858 --> 02:03:06.779]  I've sent it over a few times.
[02:03:08.015 --> 02:03:09.116]  Probably best we don't play it, okay?
[02:03:09.136 --> 02:03:10.617]  Just, you know, I learn to give up sometimes.
[02:03:11.077 --> 02:03:22.545]  And it's her with green nails, and these other women are on there, and they're like, you gotta tax it, you gotta sell ya, such and such, the men, that's how you control the men, is you gotta tax them with ya pussy and all this stuff.
[02:03:22.725 --> 02:03:25.727]  Excuse my French, that's what this has become, it's just incredible.
[02:03:26.670 --> 02:03:27.931]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[02:03:28.151 --> 02:03:35.438]  And the women that were writing back to me, if you could call them women, but, you know, you can go to my Twitter, guys.
[02:03:35.478 --> 02:03:36.879]  Like, go to my Twitter, see these viles.
[02:03:36.900 --> 02:03:37.160]  No, I saw it.
[02:03:37.180 --> 02:03:37.960]  They're threatening you.
[02:03:37.981 --> 02:03:38.841]  They're saying, shut up.
[02:03:39.622 --> 02:03:40.002]  Oh, yeah.
[02:03:40.042 --> 02:03:42.585]  And they're saying, like, you know, you just, you don't get black culture.
[02:03:42.605 --> 02:03:43.486]  You don't get black culture.
[02:03:43.506 --> 02:03:47.269]  The revolution is A-N-T, bitch.
[02:03:47.690 --> 02:03:49.591]  Keep your white female antics to yourself.
[02:03:50.052 --> 02:03:51.933]  Twerk is a circle with my ancestors.
[02:03:52.816 --> 02:03:54.257]  Twerking with the Circle with Manson.
[02:03:54.597 --> 02:03:58.119]  I'm like, well, if that's, you know, yo, you really showed me, okay, twerking in a circle.
[02:03:58.520 --> 02:04:04.704]  If this is the Black Revolution is turning girls into absolute hoes, unabashed hoes, then, you know, great.
[02:04:04.744 --> 02:04:06.785]  Like, that's a real recipe for a thriving culture.
[02:04:07.145 --> 02:04:09.727]  But we know it, that that's not a recipe for a thriving culture.
[02:04:09.747 --> 02:04:11.348]  That's a recipe to send people in prison.
[02:04:11.428 --> 02:04:15.891]  It's a recipe for miserable, you know, depression and more brokenness.
[02:04:15.971 --> 02:04:19.393]  And when you come from a broken family and when you get end up in the prison system, et cetera,
[02:04:19.713 --> 02:04:21.414]  You're a drain on the whole society.
[02:04:21.454 --> 02:04:23.575]  It's not just on a micro level, it's a macro level.
[02:04:23.955 --> 02:04:33.681]  And also, if they even care to check at the website of Black Lives Matter, it is a Marxist organization, and one of their goals is to disrupt the Western nuclear family unit.
[02:04:34.021 --> 02:04:35.382]  It's right there in black and white.
[02:04:35.702 --> 02:04:37.883]  And to try to raise children by the village.
[02:04:38.263 --> 02:04:41.606]  You know, Hillary Clinton always says, it takes a village to raise a child.
[02:04:41.946 --> 02:04:42.286]  All right.
[02:04:43.167 --> 02:04:45.368]  You know, that's not, that's a communist value.
[02:04:45.429 --> 02:04:52.614]  It means trying to take parents away from their children and raise them separately so they can instill their own creepy communist values in them.
[02:04:53.334 --> 02:05:00.340]  And yet these Black Lives Matter and these white guilt liberals that are protesting for Black Lives Matter, they don't know any of this or they don't care.
[02:05:00.820 --> 02:05:03.202]  And that's what just disgusts me even more and really fires me up.
[02:05:06.786 --> 02:05:11.049]  You know, we sit here and we talk about what Trump needs to do all day, but what do we need to do?
[02:05:11.069 --> 02:05:12.970]  What do you think citizens around the country should do?
[02:05:13.010 --> 02:05:25.337]  I mean, this is such an obvious, multinational attempt to take over the United States with race war and dollar collapse, Soros saying, you know, Trump's created a bubble, pop it, because he's betting against the United States.
[02:05:25.377 --> 02:05:29.120]  Of course it's a bubble, but they're trying to pop it because China's created an even bigger bubble.
[02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:36.204]  And all these folks that are in league with China, promoting the end of America, do people realize what's going to happen if the dollar goes down?
[02:05:38.007 --> 02:05:38.347]  Right.
[02:05:38.848 --> 02:05:40.689]  No, I don't think they're really realizing it.
[02:05:40.709 --> 02:05:46.533]  And I also don't think, you know, it's still like I sound the alarm every day on my podcast, OK, about what's coming down the pipe.
[02:05:46.654 --> 02:05:47.274]  And you do.
[02:05:47.334 --> 02:05:48.215]  I know you do, too.
[02:05:48.595 --> 02:05:54.119]  So a lot of people just think either it's conspiracy theory or they don't realize, like, the urgency of it.
[02:05:54.219 --> 02:05:56.601]  But this is not happening like five years from now.
[02:05:56.921 --> 02:05:59.623]  And nor is this a pipe dream like this is happening right now.
[02:05:59.663 --> 02:06:03.806]  They're ushering this stuff in right now and they're pushing for mandatory vaccines.
[02:06:04.087 --> 02:06:05.748]  They're pushing for this global tyranny.
[02:06:06.138 --> 02:06:06.698]  I think so.
[02:06:27.572 --> 02:06:30.915]  A lot of people feel like they can't or they don't have the means to or resources to.
[02:06:31.235 --> 02:06:40.843]  I want to raise a bunch of money for people to be able to feel like they can fight back with confidence and then give them the tools and educate them on their rights so that they can fight back and actually win.
[02:06:40.863 --> 02:06:43.725]  Because we have the ability to fight back.
[02:06:43.765 --> 02:06:45.026]  We have the masses on our side.
[02:06:46.047 --> 02:06:50.029]  But we're not really utilizing them, you know, and you're absolutely right.
[02:06:50.129 --> 02:06:51.050]  You're absolutely right.
[02:06:51.090 --> 02:06:57.914]  Listen, Deanna Lorraine, I'm going to be hosting a special three hour show, 7 to 10 Central commercial free.
[02:06:58.214 --> 02:07:01.336]  If you've got time to pop in for 30 minutes tomorrow night, Roger Stone's going to be there.
[02:07:01.736 --> 02:07:04.657]  That's going to be a big event promoting congressional candidates.
[02:07:04.677 --> 02:07:07.818]  We've got Laura Loomer, who's set to win the primary, on as well.
[02:07:07.838 --> 02:07:09.018]  But if you can't do it tomorrow night, that's fine.
[02:07:09.038 --> 02:07:16.340]  I'm going to call you later about getting you here in studio with us next week, because I've been wanting to do that for a while, and it's my fault for dropping the ball.
[02:07:16.620 --> 02:07:17.640]  So I apologize for that.
[02:07:17.700 --> 02:07:21.261]  We just really appreciate you and the great book, Taking Back America.
[02:07:21.281 --> 02:07:22.402]  We'll talk to you very, very soon.
[02:07:22.422 --> 02:07:23.802]  Sounds good, Alex.
[02:07:24.602 --> 02:07:29.183]  Okay, I wanted to get Roger on yesterday, and they had a time zone issue, and he's got some breaking news.
[02:07:29.203 --> 02:07:30.624]  So he's going to pop in briefly.
[02:07:31.496 --> 02:07:37.183]  And then I'll finish up with these few callers, Ghani, and Clint, and Isaiah, and Howard, and Tim.
[02:07:37.523 --> 02:07:45.933]  But I wanted to get him to pop in with Bill Gates responding in a Wired Magazine article to Rogers' criticism of the danger of these untested vaccines.
[02:07:45.953 --> 02:07:46.533]  That's coming up.
[02:07:46.793 --> 02:07:52.080]  And then separately, this whole operation, this whole dog hunts,
[02:07:53.902 --> 02:07:59.423]  Because of your patronage, because of your support, and I salute you, and I thank you, and I thank this great crew, and I thank the great audience.
[02:08:00.283 --> 02:08:01.684]  Go to InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:08:01.704 --> 02:08:05.905]  We've got to end the big Reopen America back-to-school special.
[02:08:05.925 --> 02:08:07.165]  We've got to end it this Sunday.
[02:08:07.685 --> 02:08:09.986]  It's 50% to 60% off the best-selling items.
[02:08:10.406 --> 02:08:11.986]  Double Patriot points.
[02:08:12.526 --> 02:08:15.007]  And a lot of these items, like Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula,
[02:08:15.547 --> 02:08:20.929]  And Living Defense that flushes out all the unwanted visitors, Next Level Probiotic, all of that is selling out.
[02:08:21.469 --> 02:08:29.811]  And because of supply chain breakdowns, a lot of these companies aren't even taking the down payment of 25% or 50%, it varies with the companies, to get it produced.
[02:08:30.171 --> 02:08:31.372]  Then we pay it on the rest delivery.
[02:08:31.952 --> 02:08:41.755]  There's that much of a breakdown, as you've heard with the truck drivers and the callers, not because the products aren't there, but because of the breakdown of the warehouses and all the hysteria, everyone's scared to leave their houses.
[02:08:42.728 --> 02:08:45.572]  This is humanity being domesticated next level.
[02:08:45.893 --> 02:08:48.697]  The answer is get out on the farms, get out on the ranches.
[02:08:48.737 --> 02:08:50.059]  If you can, get out of the cities.
[02:08:50.099 --> 02:08:52.662]  But for now, get prepared, get ready, and listen.
[02:08:53.715 --> 02:08:57.317]  We have the highest quality storable food in the best packaging you're going to find.
[02:08:58.137 --> 02:08:58.757]  It's amazing.
[02:08:58.817 --> 02:08:59.598]  It's high quality.
[02:08:59.698 --> 02:09:02.359]  They're ready to ship within two to four weeks, depending on what item you order.
[02:09:02.419 --> 02:09:03.139]  Most of it's two weeks.
[02:09:03.639 --> 02:09:04.780]  They have it all in stock.
[02:09:04.840 --> 02:09:07.441]  You need to get your food now before all hell breaks loose.
[02:09:08.822 --> 02:09:09.582]  You need firearms.
[02:09:09.602 --> 02:09:10.382]  We don't sell those.
[02:09:10.402 --> 02:09:11.263]  You need water filtration.
[02:09:11.283 --> 02:09:11.963]  We do sell that.
[02:09:12.243 --> 02:09:16.505]  But I'm telling you, get your storable food needs handled at mfullmorestore.com while you still can.
[02:09:16.605 --> 02:09:17.446]  Don't wait.
[02:09:17.746 --> 02:09:19.447]  Don't be like the grasshopper that doesn't get ready.
[02:09:19.507 --> 02:09:22.168]  Get ready like the ant, because things are crazy.
[02:09:22.728 --> 02:09:24.048]  We're getting Roger Stone on the line.
[02:09:24.428 --> 02:09:25.649]  He's got key intel.
[02:09:26.229 --> 02:09:27.109]  And so much more.
[02:09:27.609 --> 02:09:29.850]  And I am fit to be tied with what's going on.
[02:09:31.591 --> 02:09:32.811]  Alright, we're into hour number four.
[02:09:32.851 --> 02:09:33.951]  Jon Rappaport's coming up.
[02:09:34.171 --> 02:09:35.552]  I'll hit a few of your calls as well.
[02:09:36.652 --> 02:09:37.412]  So much to counter.
[02:09:37.452 --> 02:09:37.972]  So much to deal with.
[02:09:37.992 --> 02:09:39.793]  But I wanted to get Roger Stone to pop on.
[02:09:41.445 --> 02:09:46.047]  Today ahead of a special three-hour broadcast he'll be part of tomorrow night 7 to 10 p.m.
[02:09:46.067 --> 02:09:59.554]  with Laura Loomer and many others but Bill Gates specifically singled out Roger Stone in a Wired magazine article concerning vaccines and the testing being fraudulent and he admitted the testing
[02:10:00.234 --> 02:10:01.515]  Well, Alex, let me put it this way.
[02:10:01.535 --> 02:10:05.136]  I revel in Bill Gates' hatred because if I was not effective, he would not hate me.
[02:10:05.176 --> 02:10:07.997]  And when I questioned his role in trying to benefit and
[02:10:28.891 --> 02:10:35.175]  profit from this pandemic, it obviously hit the target right on.
[02:10:35.936 --> 02:10:38.357]  And therefore, he has fired back.
[02:10:39.698 --> 02:10:53.908]  It is absolutely clear that he and his cohorts intend to try to use this public health crisis to their political and geopolitical benefit, and to reap millions while they're doing it.
[02:10:55.649 --> 02:11:12.938]  If not billions, and it's so bold that they own the patents on chimera vaccines for COVID-type viruses, and that Fauci's involved, and they both co-own patents, and that he ran Operation Event 201, and that he's up there telling us what's going to happen next.
[02:11:13.418 --> 02:11:21.702]  I mean, from your research, as a former top lobbyist, have you ever seen anyone maneuver themselves into a position of power like this other than a president?
[02:11:23.072 --> 02:11:28.796]  Well, it helps to have billions of dollars to begin with, which he has at his access.
[02:11:29.437 --> 02:11:30.778]  He can buy access.
[02:11:30.818 --> 02:11:33.640]  He can buy politicians by the boatload.
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:36.422]  And it's clear that he has a plan.
[02:11:37.303 --> 02:11:48.691]  Anybody who will do the basic research can see that the public is being manipulated and that he hopes to ultimately, I believe, have a mandatory vaccination.
[02:11:49.706 --> 02:11:51.367]  And perhaps even a chip.
[02:11:51.888 --> 02:11:56.310]  I can't speak for you, Alex, but I'm not going to be vaccinated, nor am I going to be chipped.
[02:11:56.830 --> 02:11:59.072]  And I think most Americans will refuse this.
[02:11:59.172 --> 02:12:05.915]  But you were predicting this decades ago, before even I realized it was a possibility.
[02:12:06.576 --> 02:12:09.437]  I recognize the electoral plan here.
[02:12:09.858 --> 02:12:11.799]  It seems very obvious to me.
[02:12:11.819 --> 02:12:17.482]  But they intend to steal the next election through widespread ballot fraud.
[02:12:18.103 --> 02:12:28.247]  But they're trying to inoculate the public to what is happening by saying out front, Trump is going to be defeated and refuse to leave office.
[02:12:28.707 --> 02:12:39.592]  Translation, we're going to steal this from Trump and we intend to limit his ability to challenge the theft in the courts and in the court of public opinion.
[02:12:40.392 --> 02:12:43.233]  They're trying to co-opt the president's position.
[02:12:43.853 --> 02:12:47.755]  I still believe if we had an honest election, that means an election in which
[02:12:48.394 --> 02:12:55.221]  Only people who were legally eligible to vote, and they only voted once, Donald Trump would win in a landslide.
[02:12:57.703 --> 02:13:02.748]  We've got one more segment with you when we come back and I want you to recap that because I want to try to get this message to the President.
[02:13:03.208 --> 02:13:04.749]  We have the New York Times.
[02:13:05.950 --> 02:13:08.493]  For those who just joined us, saying, yeah, it's true.
[02:13:08.693 --> 02:13:18.364]  We war game with the top Democrats, John Podesta, not leaving office, having Democrat states secede, and then having our own inauguration for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
[02:13:19.286 --> 02:13:22.928]  And then Pelosi's giving interviews saying, oh, I'm second in command.
[02:13:23.168 --> 02:13:24.648]  We'll just have another inauguration.
[02:13:24.888 --> 02:13:26.009]  We don't need to be in D.C.
[02:13:26.029 --> 02:13:30.451]  So they're saying two governments at once, the Roman Empire splitting in two.
[02:13:30.811 --> 02:13:33.512]  We'll be back in 60 seconds with Roger Stone to talk about this.
[02:13:33.852 --> 02:13:35.233]  This is so otherworldly.
[02:13:35.253 --> 02:13:38.714]  And then Trump's statement a few days ago, hey, I may be gone for a long time.
[02:13:39.034 --> 02:13:40.935]  The corrupt elites are really angry at me.
[02:13:41.035 --> 02:13:44.837]  I mean, this is all edge of your seat, crazy time.
[02:13:45.417 --> 02:13:46.838]  And Roger Stone has been
[02:13:47.458 --> 02:13:56.111]  Given clemency, it's all just otherworldly to know Roger and to be in the middle of this, and you're all in the middle of this, we're all in the middle of it on this planet, and it's just gonna get wilder in the next 82 days.
[02:13:56.492 --> 02:13:57.153]  Stay with us.
[02:13:57.273 --> 02:13:59.656]  Roger Stone on the other side.
[02:14:01.443 --> 02:14:09.746]  Ladies and gentlemen, I come to you with extremely serious information and Roger Stone's here with us to give us an expert analysis.
[02:14:10.467 --> 02:14:20.971]  Bill Gates has just responded to him in a Wired Magazine article and said, how dare him question if Bill Gates is making money off the vaccine, even though he is, along with Fauci.
[02:14:20.991 --> 02:14:25.253]  So this is a very Trumpian thing that Stone does, an attack on the president.
[02:14:25.273 --> 02:14:30.115]  The president now knows that Gates is working against him with the medical deep state
[02:14:31.203 --> 02:14:42.086]  But the big thing I want to cover in a message that's sure to get to the President from Roger Stone is Roger's response to President Trump last Thursday saying, I may be gone for a long time.
[02:14:42.126 --> 02:14:43.306]  They may try to take me out.
[02:14:43.726 --> 02:14:50.308]  I'm going after China, Big Pharma, and some very big, powerful, corrupt organizations.
[02:14:50.388 --> 02:14:52.028]  What does that cryptic statement mean?
[02:14:52.068 --> 02:14:52.688]  Well, we know.
[02:14:53.248 --> 02:14:59.070]  Headline, Breitbart.com, Democrats' war game for election includes West Coast secession, civil
[02:15:00.615 --> 02:15:01.115]  War.
[02:15:01.835 --> 02:15:07.097]  And that's why Pelosi said, we'll have our own inauguration and he won't be the president and then we'll see what the military does.
[02:15:07.137 --> 02:15:11.018]  Well, it turns out Podesta running it with the Clintons, Obama and Biden.
[02:15:11.418 --> 02:15:12.359]  This is in the New York Times.
[02:15:13.059 --> 02:15:14.319]  Got almost no attention last week.
[02:15:15.099 --> 02:15:16.440]  Said they're war gaming.
[02:15:17.574 --> 02:15:25.817]  To lock the country down, hold it hostage, have the western states at least secede, and then have the military remove Trump.
[02:15:25.877 --> 02:15:30.559]  This is showdown at the OK Corral on steroids.
[02:15:30.899 --> 02:15:33.400]  Roger Stone, you've got the floor in the minutes we have.
[02:15:33.901 --> 02:15:35.781]  Former top political advisor to President Trump.
[02:15:36.222 --> 02:15:37.302]  What's really going on?
[02:15:37.622 --> 02:15:40.283]  What are they pre-programming people for?
[02:15:40.743 --> 02:15:42.164]  And what should President Trump do?
[02:15:43.204 --> 02:15:47.106]  Well, that of course Alex is the game plan for the side that lost.
[02:15:47.873 --> 02:15:48.093]  I don't
[02:16:18.169 --> 02:16:21.431]  Of winning a clear-cut victory that cannot be disputed.
[02:16:22.091 --> 02:16:27.033]  I actually think that the selection of Kamala Harris will prove to be an error.
[02:16:28.314 --> 02:16:34.937]  As you know, I'm extremely critical of Joe Biden for his role in turbocharging the war on drugs.
[02:16:35.657 --> 02:16:45.022]  It is Joe Biden who fathered the legislation that requires the harsh mandatory penalties for the first time nonviolent crime
[02:16:45.623 --> 02:16:49.646]  Of possession of small amounts of drugs for personal use.
[02:16:50.106 --> 02:16:54.549]  Drug abuse is a public health problem, not a criminal justice problem.
[02:16:54.629 --> 02:17:07.957]  But thanks to Joe Biden, literally hundreds of thousands at this point, probably millions of black people who are not violent criminals have been incarcerated for ridiculously long periods of time.
[02:17:08.769 --> 02:17:18.637]  Taxpayers are paying to house and feed and incarcerate people who are not violent criminals, people who need rehabilitation, not incarceration.
[02:17:19.097 --> 02:17:19.998]  And here's the kicker.
[02:17:21.079 --> 02:17:25.022]  Kamala Harris's record on these issues is as bad as Joe.
[02:17:25.682 --> 02:17:36.211]  As District Attorney and as Attorney General of California, she not only incarcerated a record number of people for possession,
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:39.542]  These aren't drug dealers and drug tin cans we're talking about.
[02:17:40.003 --> 02:17:48.830]  But in some cases, she fought for extending their sentences beyond their term so the state could benefit from their free labor.
[02:17:49.731 --> 02:17:50.831]  Who are the racists?
[02:17:51.312 --> 02:17:53.434]  I say they are the racists.
[02:17:54.254 --> 02:18:00.960]  And I've seen this commercial that the Trump campaign comes out, came out with, that had a bunch of racist quotes by Joe Biden.
[02:18:01.480 --> 02:18:05.964]  But Alice, I would suggest to you that deeds are more important than words.
[02:18:06.618 --> 02:18:06.718]  No.
[02:18:33.516 --> 02:18:48.170]  I totally agree with you, and this is so historic, and I agree it shows their desperation that they're already pre-preparing people that secession is normal, and martial law is normal, and civil war is normal, and that the military is going to walk him out.
[02:18:48.451 --> 02:18:50.593]  It's almost like a ghost dance, like they're hoping
[02:18:51.854 --> 02:18:52.515]  It's a legitimate concern.
[02:18:52.535 --> 02:18:55.697]  My concern, of course, is that during the eight years of the Obama presidency,
[02:19:19.887 --> 02:19:34.017]  Most of the conservative or patriotic-oriented generals and admirals at the upper levels of our military were retired, and those who were promoted were largely globalists.
[02:19:35.038 --> 02:19:48.307]  My fear is, while I believe the rank and file, and even those in the mid-level of our military are patriotic Americans, think like you and I, and will follow a direct order from the Commander-in-Chief,
[02:19:48.974 --> 02:19:54.156]  I worry about soldiers like, oh, I don't know, the Vindman brothers, for example.
[02:19:54.756 --> 02:20:01.819]  Those two liars who tried to bring the president down through false testimony regarding Ukraine.
[02:20:02.659 --> 02:20:03.719]  They're in the military.
[02:20:03.839 --> 02:20:07.220]  What does that say about where the army stands?
[02:20:07.240 --> 02:20:17.184]  Because that will be the crucial question in a showdown in which I predict you're going to have two different sets of election results, the real results.
[02:20:17.768 --> 02:20:20.630]  And the, you know, fabricated results.
[02:20:21.671 --> 02:20:23.812]  And we're going to fight this down to the wire.
[02:20:24.432 --> 02:20:27.715]  The deep state has shown that they don't have any rules.
[02:20:28.335 --> 02:20:30.136]  They don't care about the Constitution.
[02:20:30.396 --> 02:20:32.198]  They certainly don't care about the law.
[02:20:32.658 --> 02:20:35.100]  They will create their own reality.
[02:20:36.360 --> 02:20:38.041]  They're expert at it.
[02:20:38.462 --> 02:20:40.443]  I've had a front row seat in that.
[02:20:41.484 --> 02:20:44.766]  So the president has thwarted them now twice.
[02:20:45.649 --> 02:20:49.151]  Three times, if you count COVID-19.
[02:20:49.732 --> 02:20:50.612]  And he's a brawler.
[02:20:51.073 --> 02:20:52.333]  Not going down without a fight.
[02:20:53.094 --> 02:20:53.674]  And they know it.
[02:20:54.215 --> 02:20:56.056]  And they're preparing for the worst.
[02:20:56.656 --> 02:20:57.177]  That's right.
[02:20:58.237 --> 02:20:59.338]  His comments last week.
[02:21:00.058 --> 02:21:05.222]  Alex, I pray for the president and his family and their safety every single day.
[02:21:05.882 --> 02:21:07.884]  I'm a living example that prayer works.
[02:21:08.904 --> 02:21:11.806]  I'm a living example that prayer is exceedingly effective.
[02:21:12.287 --> 02:21:14.208]  And the best thing the Info Warriors can do
[02:21:14.924 --> 02:21:18.131]  Pray, day and night, for the safety of Donald Trump.
[02:21:18.231 --> 02:21:18.852]  Amen to that!
[02:21:18.993 --> 02:21:23.181]  May he remain healthy and vital and strong for the fight ahead.
[02:21:23.638 --> 02:21:24.118]  Amen to that.
[02:21:24.179 --> 02:21:33.206]  In closing, before you join us again tomorrow night, Roger, I know you're doing a great job now, released like the Kraken from your prison of gag order, doing dozens of interviews a day.
[02:21:33.226 --> 02:21:34.207]  You're having a huge effect.
[02:21:34.247 --> 02:21:38.431]  I love seeing you out there with interviews with millions of views every day and hundreds of thousands of views.
[02:21:38.731 --> 02:21:42.975]  They're definitely crapping their britches because you are definitely in your prime now.
[02:21:43.595 --> 02:21:45.757]  Kamala Harris said this back in June of this year on the 18th.
[02:21:46.838 --> 02:21:54.583]  And once Trump's gone and we have regained our rightful place in the White House, look out if you supported him and endorsed his actions.
[02:21:54.623 --> 02:21:57.284]  Because you will be coming for you next.
[02:21:57.324 --> 02:21:58.225]  We'll be coming for you next.
[02:21:58.665 --> 02:22:00.446]  You will feel the vengeance of a nation.
[02:22:00.506 --> 02:22:05.669]  No stone will be left unturned as we seek you out in every corner of this great nation.
[02:22:06.009 --> 02:22:08.691]  For it is you who have betrayed us, Kamala Harris.
[02:22:08.731 --> 02:22:09.752]  And the rest of them are saying,
[02:22:10.552 --> 02:22:11.933]  They're going to persecute all of us.
[02:22:12.333 --> 02:22:13.794]  God forbid they get rid of Trump.
[02:22:13.994 --> 02:22:16.895]  Can you imagine the reign of terror they're going to be involved in?
[02:22:18.116 --> 02:22:25.320]  Well, that quote has been pointed out to me by numerous people because that appears to be a reference to me specifically.
[02:22:25.580 --> 02:22:26.080]  Yes.
[02:22:26.140 --> 02:22:39.647]  Not surprising because Andrew Weissman, the epically corrupt federal prosecutor who really ran the Mueller investigation, basically already wrote an op-ed saying, we will retry Stone as soon as we have power.
[02:22:40.270 --> 02:22:42.771]  They don't need charges, they just need the machinery.
[02:22:42.891 --> 02:22:47.112]  And that's why I raised that, because the same group's after me, you know, we can't get into details.
[02:22:47.532 --> 02:22:49.593]  Exactly, she's saying, no stone unturned.
[02:22:49.813 --> 02:22:52.873]  She's talking, that was right after the move towards the clemency was being built, yeah.
[02:22:53.074 --> 02:22:54.394]  I mean, this is outrageous threats.
[02:22:56.074 --> 02:23:09.178]  Well, everything you say is true, but I would also remind you of the Tim Clemens prophecy that many Christians believe in, in which he predicts that David would take down Goliath,
[02:23:09.730 --> 02:23:12.797]  Meaning those who would destroy the United States.
[02:23:13.899 --> 02:23:17.426]  He predicted, as you know, that Donald Trump would be elected president.
[02:23:17.827 --> 02:23:18.228]  Alright!
[02:23:19.062 --> 02:23:21.103]  Roger Stone's got a few more minutes with us.
[02:23:21.143 --> 02:23:22.163]  He can do the whole hour.
[02:23:22.203 --> 02:23:22.963]  He's very gracious.
[02:23:22.983 --> 02:23:29.125]  He's on a way to a speech, but I need John Rappaport, who's loaded for barely able to take over, but Roger will join us tomorrow night, 7 to 10 p.m.
[02:23:29.145 --> 02:23:35.827]  We think he'll be on with us the second hour, commercial-free, and we'll have a couple hundred thousand people that tune into these live shows, I do.
[02:23:36.367 --> 02:23:37.307]  That's a great crowd.
[02:23:37.348 --> 02:23:40.128]  That's two football stadiums, but I want to reach other people.
[02:23:40.228 --> 02:23:41.609]  If those two football stadiums
[02:23:42.509 --> 02:23:45.490]  Send out on email and Facebook and Twitter and word-of-mouth.
[02:23:45.510 --> 02:23:48.851]  Hey, hear the forbidden conversation live, commercial-free.
[02:23:49.211 --> 02:23:50.352]  Hear the verboten.
[02:23:51.332 --> 02:23:56.854]  Sometimes we've had three, four million people tune into these streams four years ago during the election, and it's happening again.
[02:23:57.134 --> 02:24:02.396]  Despite all the censorship, all the craziness, new channels pop up on YouTube every day.
[02:24:03.056 --> 02:24:07.918]  Some of them will have 500,000 views in a couple hours, then they ban them.
[02:24:08.578 --> 02:24:10.559]  So now when InfoWars Whac-A-Mole pops up,
[02:24:12.397 --> 02:24:15.079]  200, 300, 400, 500,000 views on YouTube.
[02:24:15.500 --> 02:24:17.221]  And I know it's really pissed off the deep state.
[02:24:17.241 --> 02:24:18.662]  They're trying to shut it down, but man.
[02:24:19.243 --> 02:24:20.644]  And we're on all these radio stations.
[02:24:20.684 --> 02:24:22.926]  Bandot Video's got five times the traffic it had.
[02:24:23.266 --> 02:24:24.407]  Smoke's coming out of the servers.
[02:24:24.687 --> 02:24:26.949]  I'm spending millions to pay for it, but I love it.
[02:24:26.969 --> 02:24:29.010]  So thanks for funding us, folks, so we can do it.
[02:24:29.030 --> 02:24:30.231]  John Rappaport's about to take over.
[02:24:30.271 --> 02:24:31.272]  NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[02:24:31.753 --> 02:24:36.777]  But Roger Stone, finishing up, recapping, you were talking about that prophecy.
[02:24:36.797 --> 02:24:38.318]  Please repeat that and finish it off.
[02:24:39.574 --> 02:24:40.174]  Sure, Alex.
[02:24:41.014 --> 02:24:54.997]  You had made reference to the fact that it appeared to me like Kamala Harris, in a threat, named me specifically as among those who would be punished if they were to take power, punished for supporting Donald Trump.
[02:24:55.437 --> 02:24:59.298]  But I was reminding you of the Kim Clements prophecy.
[02:24:59.338 --> 02:25:01.799]  Now, Kim Clements was an evangelist.
[02:25:01.859 --> 02:25:03.319]  He is no longer with us.
[02:25:03.419 --> 02:25:08.580]  I'm in touch with his family, who, by the way, has been banned from entering the United States.
[02:25:09.215 --> 02:25:10.636]  By the Obama administration.
[02:25:10.877 --> 02:25:11.117]  Wow.
[02:25:11.317 --> 02:25:12.858]  Something I'm digging into.
[02:25:13.399 --> 02:25:20.325]  But Kim Clemens basically foresaw the election of Donald Trump, foresaw the failed impeachment.
[02:25:21.046 --> 02:25:23.508]  He has had an extraordinary record of accuracy.
[02:25:24.609 --> 02:25:31.375]  And he talks about this epic struggle, saying, they shall be shocked how he takes the giant down.
[02:25:32.056 --> 02:25:35.739]  The brothers of Goliath stand and glee, watching America.
[02:25:36.109 --> 02:25:37.710]  We will cripple you, they yelled.
[02:25:37.970 --> 02:25:39.231]  You will lose your credit.
[02:25:40.051 --> 02:25:41.672]  You will be destroyed.
[02:25:42.493 --> 02:25:43.974]  God replied, Watch.
[02:25:44.614 --> 02:25:47.756]  Look not to Wall Street, however, but observe.
[02:25:48.616 --> 02:25:50.277]  What is your plan for this giant?
[02:25:50.677 --> 02:25:51.418]  They demanded.
[02:25:52.198 --> 02:25:54.039]  And the Lord took a simple stone.
[02:25:54.780 --> 02:25:56.321]  Remember that name.
[02:25:56.981 --> 02:25:59.182]  And he will hold it up and they will laugh at him.
[02:26:00.063 --> 02:26:05.106]  But the plan is so brilliant, said the Lord, that it could only have been given by me.
[02:26:06.058 --> 02:26:08.000]  That is the prophecy of Kim Clement.
[02:26:08.800 --> 02:26:17.166]  So, if I am in this time, in this place, if there is work that God wants me to do, I'm prepared, Alex.
[02:26:17.727 --> 02:26:21.169]  When God is ready to reveal his plan to me, I believe he will.
[02:26:21.690 --> 02:26:26.013]  And I will serve my God and my country as I'm supposed to.
[02:26:26.614 --> 02:26:31.437]  I do believe that I was put in this epic struggle for freedom for some good reason.
[02:26:32.078 --> 02:26:34.860]  That I'm here in this time, in this place, as you are.
[02:26:35.441 --> 02:26:39.984]  To save not just the United States of America, but Western civilization.
[02:26:40.004 --> 02:26:45.328]  Well, Roger, I remember hearing about Tim Clemmon before Trump got elected and all the rest of it.
[02:26:45.348 --> 02:26:52.573]  I remember reading that and seeing that and then now how obsessed they are with you and me to a secondary level and Bill Gates coming out and attacking you.
[02:26:52.693 --> 02:26:55.315]  It is getting really crazy and really wild.
[02:26:55.775 --> 02:26:56.195]  All right.
[02:26:56.235 --> 02:26:57.596]  Well, thank you so much, Roger.
[02:26:57.616 --> 02:26:58.977]  What's the best website for people to visit?
[02:26:59.478 --> 02:27:00.859]  Is it StoneDefenseFund.com?
[02:27:01.459 --> 02:27:04.161]  StoneDefenseFund.com because I still have to finance
[02:27:04.659 --> 02:27:13.526]  My appeal, I continue to insist that I'm innocent, but more importantly, I want to expose the deep state at the appeal court level.
[02:27:13.987 --> 02:27:16.469]  It will all be revealed if I can get to appeal.
[02:27:16.489 --> 02:27:17.750]  All right, we'll talk to you tomorrow night.
[02:27:17.810 --> 02:27:18.190]  Be safe.
[02:27:19.271 --> 02:27:19.972]  Look forward to it.
[02:27:20.012 --> 02:27:20.832]  God bless you, Alex.
[02:27:20.852 --> 02:27:21.553]  God bless you.
[02:27:22.033 --> 02:27:23.715]  NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[02:27:23.775 --> 02:27:24.956]  NoMoreFakeNews.com.
[02:27:25.536 --> 02:27:28.979]  People always wait for Wednesdays when Jon Rappaport's here.
[02:27:29.019 --> 02:27:31.141]  We're sorry to cut into his time, but he understands we have to do that sometimes.
[02:27:31.501 --> 02:27:32.282]  So thank you, sir.
[02:27:32.322 --> 02:27:33.403]  Tell us what you're about to cover.
[02:27:35.214 --> 02:27:47.197]  Okay Alex, well I'm just going to run down my research going back to the beginning of this whole coronavirus fake pandemic because that's what I've done on my website.
[02:27:47.357 --> 02:27:54.378]  I've decided to go back to the beginning and just retrace every fake step all the way to the present.
[02:27:54.678 --> 02:27:59.719]  So I'll compress it down and just lay it out in the rest of the hour here.
[02:27:59.739 --> 02:28:03.480]  The floor is yours my friend!
[02:28:04.738 --> 02:28:06.059]  Thank you very much, Alex.
[02:28:06.759 --> 02:28:07.880]  Always good to talk to you.
[02:28:09.161 --> 02:28:09.781]  Okay, folks.
[02:28:10.822 --> 02:28:26.333]  So, as we approach the first break here, I decided, because there's so many new people coming on board, readers, and so on, let's go back to the beginning.
[02:28:28.094 --> 02:28:29.135]  How this all started.
[02:28:30.576 --> 02:28:34.078]  When I began to look into it and write articles and so on.
[02:28:34.787 --> 02:28:37.409]  I've been covering fake epidemics for 30 years.
[02:28:39.150 --> 02:28:40.692]  This pattern looks the same.
[02:28:42.293 --> 02:28:43.394]  So where does it begin?
[02:28:45.375 --> 02:29:02.189]  First of all, all the exercises, the planning sessions, the drills, the meetings, the seminars that people have detailed, the basic purpose of all of that pre-planning
[02:29:03.630 --> 02:29:10.535]  is to create a structure that will sell a story when the time comes.
[02:29:11.695 --> 02:29:13.857]  Sell a story about a virus.
[02:29:15.158 --> 02:29:16.539]  That's what this is all about.
[02:29:17.519 --> 02:29:22.843]  To create the structure worldwide, to weld it into place.
[02:29:23.663 --> 02:29:33.310]  Yes, of course, it involves media, but it also involves public health agencies, not only the CDC and the World Health Organization,
[02:29:34.304 --> 02:29:39.669]  But individual national public health agencies in the U.S.
[02:29:39.829 --> 02:29:46.374]  at the state level, surrounding governors and mayors, they all have public health advisors.
[02:29:47.155 --> 02:30:02.388]  They bring the mayors and the governors in on these meetings, and they get agreement and understanding that if something sparks off, if there is a pandemic, some sort of
[02:30:03.266 --> 02:30:08.890]  Sudden outbreak that everybody is on board with the message.
[02:30:10.591 --> 02:30:24.441]  That's how these political leaders were entrained and prepared and prepped to respond unanimously when the announcement was made that something happened in China.
[02:30:25.922 --> 02:30:27.843]  This is very important to understand.
[02:30:29.745 --> 02:30:31.686]  The pre-pandemic planning
[02:30:32.574 --> 02:30:37.316]  was about that, above and beyond everything else.
[02:30:38.396 --> 02:30:57.284]  How to install this structure to get stimulus response action from political leaders all the way up to the top of nations, to the top of states, so that when the trigger is pulled, everything becomes automatic.
[02:30:58.885 --> 02:31:02.046]  If the CDC, the World Health Organization,
[02:31:02.830 --> 02:31:07.453]  Bill Gates, et cetera, say it's time for lockdowns.
[02:31:08.434 --> 02:31:09.574]  Everybody goes along.
[02:31:10.975 --> 02:31:12.256]  That was the plan.
[02:31:14.557 --> 02:31:27.185]  To sell a story about a virus that would function as a cover story for the real war, economic devastation and attack on the population of the planet.
[02:31:28.386 --> 02:31:29.707]  Which is phase one.
[02:31:30.367 --> 02:31:41.736]  of the transformation from the way things have been to the new normal, the new technocracy, the new fascism, the new tyranny.
[02:31:43.437 --> 02:31:48.541]  That is step one of creating a fake pandemic.
[02:31:49.661 --> 02:31:53.284]  Understand it, know it, grasp it.
[02:31:53.704 --> 02:31:56.767]  We'll be back after the break with a lot more John Rappaport here.
[02:31:58.248 --> 02:31:59.629]  All right, continuing with
[02:32:00.794 --> 02:32:02.674]  The creation of a false pandemic.
[02:32:04.455 --> 02:32:14.537]  Once you've got the structure in place and the messaging, then you have to have an outbreak, which means a story about an outbreak.
[02:32:15.677 --> 02:32:25.179]  Doesn't mean a real outbreak, because it's much easier and much more controllable to sell a story about a virus than an actual virus.
[02:32:26.199 --> 02:32:29.280]  And I've spent many hours and many articles about this
[02:32:30.202 --> 02:32:36.485]  Just to boil it down, in Wuhan, a story emerged about a novel virus.
[02:32:38.646 --> 02:32:39.827]  It was a fake story.
[02:32:40.247 --> 02:32:41.968]  It continues to be a fake story.
[02:32:42.949 --> 02:32:48.992]  I'm now publishing articles at NoMoreFakeNews about the fake discovery of the new coronavirus.
[02:32:52.053 --> 02:32:52.834]  What does that mean?
[02:32:53.514 --> 02:32:55.195]  That means that researchers
[02:32:56.164 --> 02:33:04.429]  Some of whom, many of whom believe they're actually carrying out correct procedures to isolate a new virus are not.
[02:33:06.390 --> 02:33:17.937]  They're carrying out procedures that can result in all kinds of extraneous material and irrelevant material being called a new virus, which is what happens.
[02:33:18.962 --> 02:33:23.885]  And they say we have a new virus and we're going to call it SARS-CoV-2 and here it is.
[02:33:24.565 --> 02:33:26.426]  And it's spreading across the planet.
[02:33:27.266 --> 02:33:28.187]  That's the story.
[02:33:28.767 --> 02:33:30.088]  That's the cover story.
[02:33:30.168 --> 02:33:32.069]  That's the messaging.
[02:33:32.169 --> 02:33:33.870]  And it goes wall to wall.
[02:33:34.890 --> 02:33:45.455]  And then China locks down 50 million people overnight, which has never been done before at that scale in the history of humankind.
[02:33:47.796 --> 02:33:48.717]  And they sell that.
[02:33:50.307 --> 02:33:52.908]  We're restraining and constraining the virus.
[02:33:52.928 --> 02:33:56.230]  That's why we locked down 50 million people overnight.
[02:33:57.410 --> 02:34:07.315]  And remember, this also took place at a time of the Chinese New Year when there were hundreds of millions of people already moving about China.
[02:34:08.516 --> 02:34:11.157]  So they tried to squelch all of that.
[02:34:11.277 --> 02:34:13.838]  Of course, they couldn't and they knew they couldn't.
[02:34:15.619 --> 02:34:19.081]  But they said we're locking down 50 million people.
[02:34:19.969 --> 02:34:35.302]  Then the CDC and the World Health Organization and Bill Gates turned around as if pleasantly shocked by this, as if they didn't know this was already in the planning and said, my goodness, look at what's just happened.
[02:34:35.882 --> 02:34:38.044]  China locked down 50 million people.
[02:34:38.725 --> 02:34:42.008]  That must mean it's quite serious and quite heavy.
[02:34:42.708 --> 02:34:46.371]  And in the West, we may have to do the same thing.
[02:34:47.092 --> 02:34:48.113]  And now we can.
[02:34:48.871 --> 02:34:50.532]  Because China's broken the ice.
[02:34:51.453 --> 02:34:56.095]  China has set the new standard and all praise to China.
[02:34:57.256 --> 02:34:58.577]  That's exactly what happened.
[02:35:00.238 --> 02:35:09.403]  So now the entire Western world and other nations all around the world were teetering on the edge of declaring lockdowns.
[02:35:10.584 --> 02:35:13.125]  Italy did declare national lockdown.
[02:35:15.426 --> 02:35:16.267]  Based on nothing.
[02:35:17.748 --> 02:35:17.968]  Again.
[02:35:19.091 --> 02:35:22.712]  Fake discovery of new virus, based on nothing!
[02:35:25.913 --> 02:35:36.656]  So, there needed to be one more little piece of the puzzle, and that was provided by Neil Ferguson, a computer modeler at the Imperial College of London.
[02:35:38.076 --> 02:35:44.538]  Ferguson's institute is bankrolled by Bill Gates to the tune of tens of millions of dollars a year.
[02:35:45.802 --> 02:35:55.847]  Neil Ferguson is a failed computer modeler who is world famous for some unknown reason, certainly not his competence.
[02:35:56.507 --> 02:35:57.948]  I've detailed all of this.
[02:35:58.788 --> 02:36:01.630]  But nevertheless, he makes a dire prediction.
[02:36:01.650 --> 02:36:06.452]  500,000 deaths in the UK, 2 million in the US.
[02:36:07.452 --> 02:36:14.876]  These figures are transmitted through Fauci, through other people, to Boris Johnson, to
[02:36:15.549 --> 02:36:16.309]  Donald Trump.
[02:36:17.330 --> 02:36:18.891]  And they fold like a cheap suit.
[02:36:19.991 --> 02:36:28.556]  Well, you're saying that two million deaths are going to be on my head unless I support state of emergency and lockdown the whole country?
[02:36:28.636 --> 02:36:29.216]  Yes, sir.
[02:36:30.036 --> 02:36:30.897]  And then it was done.
[02:36:32.178 --> 02:36:33.458]  And it's still being done.
[02:36:34.839 --> 02:36:36.100]  And it can be done again.
[02:36:37.100 --> 02:36:44.524]  Because these opening ups of the economy, excuse me, are all conditional on
[02:36:45.913 --> 02:36:47.174]  What are the case numbers?
[02:36:47.874 --> 02:36:55.480]  So now we come to the fake diagnostic tests, which are supposedly the basis of all of these case numbers and death numbers.
[02:36:57.441 --> 02:37:11.090]  The tests, as serious people know, are inherently flawed to produce false positive results, like coins coming out of a jackpot-rigged slot machine.
[02:37:12.531 --> 02:37:15.073]  That is, the tests will read
[02:37:15.746 --> 02:37:19.547]  False positive pointing to COVID.
[02:37:20.627 --> 02:37:21.087]  OK.
[02:37:22.188 --> 02:37:27.349]  Based on completely irrelevant germs in the body that have nothing to do with anything.
[02:37:29.449 --> 02:37:29.970]  Perfect.
[02:37:31.010 --> 02:37:35.071]  That gives you the case numbers, which are entirely meaningless.
[02:37:36.311 --> 02:37:39.912]  And rigged and inflated 16 different ways from Sunday.
[02:37:39.932 --> 02:37:42.393]  I've detailed all of that.
[02:37:42.853 --> 02:37:43.813]  So have other people.
[02:37:44.599 --> 02:37:53.245]  But the fundamental fakery in the diagnostic test is that they're looking for a virus that was never discovered in the first place.
[02:37:54.486 --> 02:38:13.440]  But nevertheless, this produces all the fake COVID case numbers, the death numbers, and so on, which are hyped by the messaging wall to wall throughout the world by governors, mayors, premiers, prime ministers, and presidents, public health authorities,
[02:38:14.270 --> 02:38:24.255]  And lead to more and more lockdowns and economic devastation, which again is really the intent of the whole operation.
[02:38:25.516 --> 02:38:41.384]  To create wreckage and chaos, poverty, despair, murder, suicide, etc., etc., bankruptcies, the end of the current currency system,
[02:38:44.462 --> 02:38:45.483]  Throughout the planet.
[02:38:47.644 --> 02:38:54.908]  The virus story is the cover story under which the real economic war is taking place.
[02:38:57.790 --> 02:39:13.020]  Now, as this operation proceeds, there are other branches that move off the central trunk of the tree, such as public health agencies will expand the definition of a case of COVID-19
[02:39:14.238 --> 02:39:18.801]  In order to billow and inflate the case numbers.
[02:39:19.501 --> 02:39:33.890]  For example, if you look at the March and April statements by the CDC, you will see that pretty much anybody can be diagnosed with COVID-19 without a test.
[02:39:34.851 --> 02:39:43.236]  Chills and fever or a cough and a contact with some group said to be at risk
[02:39:45.080 --> 02:39:46.821]  Diagnose them as a COVID case.
[02:39:48.401 --> 02:39:59.066]  So there is the definition expanding phase where more and more people are brought under this fake umbrella of being COVID cases.
[02:40:00.726 --> 02:40:14.232]  And then of course, you also expand not only the number of people that can be brought into the game, but the number of symptoms that can be attributed to COVID-19.
[02:40:15.822 --> 02:40:18.804]  With no scientific rigorous evidence whatsoever.
[02:40:20.025 --> 02:40:24.968]  Oh, heart attacks, mental disorders, whatever, whatever, whatever.
[02:40:26.169 --> 02:40:38.918]  And suddenly you have expanding coverage and definition of COVID-19 and you have more and more cases escalating, more fear, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:40:40.459 --> 02:40:44.442]  Then because of the masks and the social distancing, which are completely
[02:40:45.017 --> 02:40:49.418]  counterproductive and meaningless for all sorts of reasons.
[02:40:51.039 --> 02:41:09.104]  You isolate people from not only their loved ones, but from everybody else, so that people can't righteously collect in one place to protest, to rebel, etc., etc., etc., because they're isolated.
[02:41:11.072 --> 02:41:15.414]  Now you're getting the picture, the fuller picture of how this whole operation works.
[02:41:16.034 --> 02:41:17.394]  I'll have more after the break.
[02:41:17.434 --> 02:41:19.475]  This is John Rappaport on InfoWars.
[02:41:20.536 --> 02:41:21.736]  Last segment here, folks.
[02:41:24.317 --> 02:41:31.800]  So with all of this setup that I've been describing here, now comes, of course, the solution, which is the vaccine.
[02:41:33.540 --> 02:41:38.962]  And they've been desperately trying to move it into the market, to get it approved.
[02:41:39.082 --> 02:41:40.203]  What is it going to be?
[02:41:41.141 --> 02:41:46.042]  There are numerous candidates, clinical trials, etc, etc, etc.
[02:41:46.622 --> 02:41:57.024]  We've got Moderna, for example, which is a company that has received $500 million from the federal government to develop a COVID vaccine.
[02:41:57.824 --> 02:42:01.265]  And that company has never brought a drug or vaccine to market.
[02:42:02.225 --> 02:42:02.425]  Ever.
[02:42:03.445 --> 02:42:03.645]  Ever.
[02:42:05.026 --> 02:42:07.146]  So there's something about this company.
[02:42:08.041 --> 02:42:11.382]  That is significant for Anthony Fauci, who is touting it.
[02:42:12.123 --> 02:42:13.603]  Bill Gates, who's touting it.
[02:42:14.124 --> 02:42:19.986]  And that is that it has RNA technology and nanotechnology behind it.
[02:42:22.527 --> 02:42:30.150]  Without going into a long song and dance, since I don't have the time about those technologies, I've covered them before here on the show.
[02:42:32.051 --> 02:42:36.533]  Gates is desperate to get RNA technology approved in any product
[02:42:37.242 --> 02:42:38.303]  into the marketplace.
[02:42:38.403 --> 02:42:49.489]  It's never been approved before because it causes severe adverse reactions, as they say, in patients who are treated with this technology.
[02:42:49.509 --> 02:42:57.993]  The body tends to go to war against itself, which is euphemistically called an autoimmune reaction.
[02:42:59.394 --> 02:43:02.095]  But the thing about RNA technology is that
[02:43:04.827 --> 02:43:11.971]  It can be used to develop and produce vaccines very quickly, easily and cheaply, which of course Gates wants to do.
[02:43:12.751 --> 02:43:17.013]  Because then you can say, well, we have 50 new viruses we just discovered.
[02:43:17.654 --> 02:43:30.360]  And instead of taking six years in each case to bring a new vaccine to market by the old method, we want to do it quickly in a matter of months for all 50 and shoot up everybody.
[02:43:31.021 --> 02:43:33.302]  And that's the way to do it with RNA technology.
[02:43:36.323 --> 02:43:39.605]  So they're trying to move this down through the pipeline.
[02:43:40.506 --> 02:43:48.111]  It's not a slam dunk, but they're using every method they can to get this into the marketplace.
[02:43:49.512 --> 02:43:49.992]  Watch out.
[02:43:51.433 --> 02:43:51.913]  Watch out.
[02:43:54.375 --> 02:43:56.716]  Besides the vaccine, what are we talking about?
[02:43:57.317 --> 02:44:01.980]  Well, as I said, the real operation here, phase one, is economic wreckage.
[02:44:03.081 --> 02:44:05.162]  But it isn't just to leave that.
[02:44:06.212 --> 02:44:07.533]  What's phase two?
[02:44:08.334 --> 02:44:16.259]  Phase two is building a new world order on top of the wreckage, which is already in progress, in case you hadn't noticed.
[02:44:17.200 --> 02:44:19.261]  What does that mean, NWO?
[02:44:19.942 --> 02:44:20.682]  Globalism.
[02:44:20.762 --> 02:44:21.623]  What does that mean?
[02:44:22.183 --> 02:44:35.773]  It basically means a borderless planet, or to look at it another way, what is euphemistically called global governance, meaning the entire planet is ruled
[02:44:36.434 --> 02:44:40.256]  Top-down by a small group of men.
[02:44:42.677 --> 02:44:44.398]  You can call it anything you want to.
[02:44:45.599 --> 02:44:48.780]  You can call it socialism, communism, totalitarianism.
[02:44:48.800 --> 02:44:50.801]  You can call it tyranny.
[02:44:50.821 --> 02:44:52.082]  You can call it fascism.
[02:44:52.102 --> 02:44:53.002]  You can call it Nazis.
[02:44:53.083 --> 02:44:55.504]  You can call it USSR.
[02:44:56.064 --> 02:44:57.985]  It doesn't matter what you call it.
[02:44:59.126 --> 02:45:01.767]  All of these names amount to the same thing.
[02:45:02.627 --> 02:45:03.728]  Police, state.
[02:45:06.292 --> 02:45:10.393]  Iron control from the top down.
[02:45:11.214 --> 02:45:13.374]  What is the reason given for this?
[02:45:13.534 --> 02:45:17.475]  Well, look at what happened when we had this pandemic.
[02:45:19.276 --> 02:45:26.058]  We can't afford to miss an early warning signal when the next one comes along.
[02:45:27.461 --> 02:45:29.102]  Don't look for logic here, folks.
[02:45:29.702 --> 02:45:30.723]  This is hype.
[02:45:31.123 --> 02:45:32.204]  This is propaganda.
[02:45:32.244 --> 02:45:33.084]  This is promotion.
[02:45:33.565 --> 02:45:53.496]  So we have to have planetary surveillance wall-to-wall in your workplace, in your home, in public places, everywhere, all the time, and in your body, because we don't trust simply exterior surveillance.
[02:45:54.697 --> 02:45:57.218]  We need new technology.
[02:45:57.537 --> 02:45:59.558]  We need technocracy.
[02:45:59.758 --> 02:46:04.682]  We need engineering at a level at which it's never been done before.
[02:46:05.302 --> 02:46:14.388]  For example, using nanoparticles, very tiny particles, to insert into the body that will function as sensors.
[02:46:15.248 --> 02:46:15.989]  What does that mean?
[02:46:17.069 --> 02:46:24.254]  That means these little tiny, I mean very, very tiny sensors in the body, in the brain,
[02:46:24.864 --> 02:46:43.047]  Would be able to transmit information from inside your body to an external control point where that information all about physiological changes, processes in the body and the brain that are taking place.
[02:46:43.788 --> 02:46:44.588]  This is real.
[02:46:44.608 --> 02:46:46.328]  This is not science fiction.
[02:46:47.908 --> 02:46:51.749]  It's in progress under development as we speak.
[02:46:52.699 --> 02:47:06.487]  That all of this information flowing out of your body from these sensors is collected, collated, analyzed, profiled to see what you're up to, basically.
[02:47:07.008 --> 02:47:08.088]  What are you up to?
[02:47:09.109 --> 02:47:20.636]  This is the most intimate look they can do to try to spy and discover what you are up to at any given moment in real time.
[02:47:22.512 --> 02:47:27.696]  But these nanotechnology sensors also function in the opposite direction.
[02:47:27.776 --> 02:47:37.123]  That is, they would be able to receive information from the outside while they are located in your body and brain.
[02:47:37.703 --> 02:47:38.724]  And what would that mean?
[02:47:39.404 --> 02:47:43.907]  That would mean information as, for example, instructions.
[02:47:45.409 --> 02:47:51.493]  Instructions that could change your physiology, change your function.
[02:47:52.386 --> 02:47:53.246]  Body function.
[02:47:53.386 --> 02:47:54.267]  Brain function.
[02:47:56.168 --> 02:47:58.268]  That's the objective there.
[02:47:59.869 --> 02:48:00.429]  Control.
[02:48:00.890 --> 02:48:01.410]  Control.
[02:48:01.890 --> 02:48:02.370]  Control.
[02:48:02.510 --> 02:48:03.331]  And more control.
[02:48:03.571 --> 02:48:05.011]  And then more control.
[02:48:06.512 --> 02:48:08.012]  That's the promised land.
[02:48:08.693 --> 02:48:13.495]  That's the holy grail of what are euphemistically called the globalists.
[02:48:14.875 --> 02:48:17.196]  They are the technocracists.
[02:48:18.577 --> 02:48:21.338]  They are the technocrologists.
[02:48:22.264 --> 02:48:23.585]  They are technocrats.
[02:48:24.365 --> 02:48:27.387]  They want to create the world as a machine.
[02:48:29.288 --> 02:48:30.389]  And they're on the way.
[02:48:31.309 --> 02:48:32.530]  Currency reset?
[02:48:32.670 --> 02:48:33.170]  Of course!
[02:48:34.031 --> 02:48:50.540]  Because as we've seen even before this whole COVID insanity, currencies were dead-ending not just once but multiple times in a crash, on a crash, on a crash, on a crash,
[02:48:51.195 --> 02:49:12.031]  Worldwide because the invention of money on top of money on top of other invented money and so on and so forth was reaching a point of no return, meaning that the collaborative fakery of nations was falling apart.
[02:49:13.231 --> 02:49:15.173]  It was just too much to sustain.
[02:49:17.560 --> 02:49:21.681]  The stage play was becoming too obvious to too many people.
[02:49:22.621 --> 02:49:26.482]  So it was time for a massive currency reset.
[02:49:27.223 --> 02:49:46.248]  And they, again, technocrats, globalists, needed an excuse, a reason to say, well, now we certainly have to have a currency reset, which is a complete global reorganization of the concept and the practice
[02:49:46.863 --> 02:49:47.463]  Of money.
[02:49:49.164 --> 02:49:50.445]  By new standards.
[02:49:51.465 --> 02:49:52.986]  That's what we're talking about.
[02:49:53.846 --> 02:49:58.428]  And so the excuse is, well, look at the economic wreckage all around.
[02:49:59.408 --> 02:50:00.909]  Is the bailout working?
[02:50:01.509 --> 02:50:02.510]  No, it's not.
[02:50:03.010 --> 02:50:04.250]  We acknowledge that.
[02:50:04.350 --> 02:50:07.812]  Yes, indeed, we're doing the best we can, etc., etc.
[02:50:08.372 --> 02:50:14.735]  We're devoting trillions to trying to help people who've been afflicted by the lockdowns, etc., etc.
[02:50:15.996 --> 02:50:19.298]  But really, is this solving the problem?
[02:50:19.978 --> 02:50:21.459]  Unfortunately, no.
[02:50:21.479 --> 02:50:27.382]  So really, what we're going to have to do is certainly go to a digital currency completely.
[02:50:28.002 --> 02:50:32.885]  And then we're going to have to, what is the word we really want to use here?
[02:50:33.025 --> 02:50:34.165]  Reallocate?
[02:50:34.866 --> 02:50:35.986]  Reorganize?
[02:50:36.086 --> 02:50:37.107]  Restructure?
[02:50:37.787 --> 02:50:39.048]  Yes, restructure.
[02:50:39.088 --> 02:50:40.108]  Let's call it that.
[02:50:40.769 --> 02:50:45.691]  The entire global economy under new arrangements.
[02:50:53.785 --> 02:50:57.527]  Yes, we're certainly going to have, what could we call it?
[02:50:57.587 --> 02:51:03.229]  Let's call it UGI, Universal Guaranteed Income for every person on earth.
[02:51:04.790 --> 02:51:07.030]  Like that idea, people would like that idea.
[02:51:07.050 --> 02:51:10.052]  But of course, it's tied to your behavior.
[02:51:10.832 --> 02:51:13.233]  If you behave, if you fall in line,
[02:51:14.096 --> 02:51:17.437]  Then you get this income, but if you don't, no.
[02:51:18.757 --> 02:51:20.378]  Does that sound like a horror show?
[02:51:20.898 --> 02:51:21.238]  It is.
[02:51:21.738 --> 02:51:24.739]  There's much more to say, but my time is up this week.
[02:51:25.359 --> 02:51:27.820]  I think you're getting the complete picture here.
[02:51:28.460 --> 02:51:29.440]  John Mappeport.
[02:51:30.000 --> 02:51:31.001]  No more fake news.
[02:51:31.301 --> 02:51:32.041]  See you next time.
[02:51:42.932 --> 02:51:46.775]  Just a few months ago, almost every storable food manufacturer was sold out.
[02:51:47.315 --> 02:51:50.658]  They were still taking people's orders, and many of the companies have still not fulfilled them.
[02:51:51.118 --> 02:51:52.840]  All the orders we got in have been fulfilled.
[02:51:53.180 --> 02:51:59.425]  Our supplier's the best, the highest quality, the best containers to transport it as well, and they've got the food with four factories in stock.
[02:51:59.705 --> 02:52:01.946]  Takes them two to four weeks to get it shipped out to you.
[02:52:02.347 --> 02:52:04.088]  You need to order your storable food now.
[02:52:04.428 --> 02:52:05.869]  The world is much more dire.
[02:52:06.070 --> 02:52:07.811]  The economic system is collapsing.
[02:52:07.831 --> 02:52:09.272]  The third world's already starving to death.
[02:52:09.551 --> 02:52:10.912]  Food prices are exploding here.
[02:52:11.732 --> 02:52:15.554]  The farms and the production plants are shutting down because of the COVID hoax.
[02:52:15.855 --> 02:52:19.197]  You need to get your storable food while you still can at mfullworthstore.com.
[02:52:19.217 --> 02:52:19.977]  It's a 360 win.
[02:52:20.257 --> 02:52:24.119]  It also funds our operation, but you need to get it whether it's three months, six months, a year.
[02:52:24.440 --> 02:52:28.942]  You need to get that now and have that check box off of being prepared and being self-sufficient.
[02:52:28.962 --> 02:52:30.463]  We also have high quality water filtration.
[02:52:30.674 --> 02:52:37.037]  Owen Schroer here, host of the InfoWars War Room, every day from 3 to 6 p.m., and that means I have to follow up after the big man, and that is not an easy task.
[02:52:37.077 --> 02:52:43.199]  So I need to be as focused and energized as possible every day at 3 o'clock.
[02:52:59.466 --> 02:53:02.128]  Yes, I am on performance enhancing drugs.
[02:53:02.588 --> 02:53:25.102]  It's the combination of the energy of the turbo force, the focus of the brain force, and then the VasoBeat Complete, which is a beet supplement, which act as a vasodilator, which makes sure that the nutrients and supplements that you're intaking are getting all throughout the body so that I can maintain proper focus and energy for three hours and beyond.
[02:53:25.302 --> 02:53:26.583]  It's almost three o'clock.
[02:53:26.783 --> 02:53:33.249]  That means it's time to take my performance enhancers that I have conveniently stashed right here at my desk.
[02:53:33.369 --> 02:53:37.192]  I literally will never host a war room without them.
[02:53:37.372 --> 02:53:40.935]  It starts with the Turbo Force right here.
[02:53:41.135 --> 02:53:44.518]  Just get your cup of water, pour in the Turbo Force.
[02:53:44.738 --> 02:53:47.361]  I then take my Vezo B Complete right here.
[02:53:48.201 --> 02:53:50.443]  One dropper, two droppers.
[02:53:51.184 --> 02:53:53.266]  Stir it up just a little bit for good measure.
[02:53:54.901 --> 02:54:12.777]  And then, with the energy from the TurboForce and the nitrates in the VesoBeat Complete, with the Focus from BrainForce, with the Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, and all the other supplements that are inside of that, those are the supplements I take.
[02:54:13.846 --> 02:54:20.289]  Every day, right before I go on air, for maximum performance, maximum focus, maximum energy.
[02:54:20.729 --> 02:54:33.554]  And the good news is, once I finish drinking this Turbo Force, I've got energy for about 10 hours, so I can continue working, pass the show, work on other things, go and lift weights, run, whatever I need or want to do.
[02:54:33.754 --> 02:54:42.118]  It's all with the Turbo Force, the Brain Force, and the Vezo Beat Complete Trifecta, available only at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:54:42.978 --> 02:54:49.287]  Talk to the EMS or talk to the medical doctors and what makes you nauseated, it's not just the smell of piss, but we call the smell of bum piss.
[02:54:49.307 --> 02:54:50.929]  It has that sweet, nauseating smell.
[02:54:51.049 --> 02:54:55.796]  It's the sweet stench that makes you want to throw up like rotten meat.
[02:54:56.197 --> 02:54:57.399]  It is the crap of the world.
[02:54:58.561 --> 02:55:02.704]  Have you noticed the stench of bum piss in your leftist-run neighborhoods?
[02:55:03.084 --> 02:55:09.608]  The crap of dust mites in bum piss is a real thing, and InfoWars Store has the solution.
[02:55:09.829 --> 02:55:22.277]  InfoWars has created the most powerful herbal lung cleanse and respiratory support product on the market, with over a thousand types of mold and mildew, toxic chemicals, and yes, dust mites.
[02:55:22.717 --> 02:55:36.084]  Our Lung Cleanse Plus, made with organic and wild cultivated herbs, is just what you need to survive the unprecedented surge of bum piss and other toxic substances in liberal leftist cities everywhere.
[02:55:36.364 --> 02:55:42.126]  Order the InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse Plus supplement today at infowarstore.com.
[02:55:42.827 --> 02:55:47.449]  Four years ago, I added a member to the InfoWars Life team who has developed
[02:55:50.589 --> 02:55:52.591]  We believe it is the strongest in the market.
[02:55:52.611 --> 02:55:54.292]  If somebody else has got one we don't know about it.
[02:56:17.611 --> 02:56:19.212]  Now, folks absolutely love it.
[02:56:19.252 --> 02:56:21.032]  They love the results that they get from it.
[02:56:21.812 --> 02:56:24.393]  Now, this is apples and oranges because it complements bodies.
[02:56:24.913 --> 02:56:31.095]  But, going back over seven years ago, we had a major supplier of high-quality, organic turmeric that was liquid that you take under the tongue.
[02:56:31.495 --> 02:56:32.235]  And people loved it.
[02:56:32.556 --> 02:56:37.737]  Then we could no longer get any more because that company was so overloaded with orders from other people.
[02:56:37.857 --> 02:56:40.418]  Because getting high-quality turmeric is really a tough thing to do.
[02:56:40.838 --> 02:56:46.785]  We've now secured another company in the last year that has even higher quality turmeric concentrate.
[02:56:46.805 --> 02:56:50.229]  This is one ingredient, pure turmeric extract.
[02:56:50.529 --> 02:56:52.511]  It's the liquid type, taken out of the tongue.
[02:56:52.591 --> 02:56:55.815]  If you love bodies, I think you're really going to love this product.
[02:56:56.215 --> 02:57:00.980]  Some people around the office that have tried it say it's better than bodies, some say it's not, some say it supercharges it.
[02:57:01.400 --> 02:57:10.909]  All I know is this is one of the strongest, if not the strongest, turmeric extracts under the tongue you can find out there and it's got a different delivery system.
[02:57:11.249 --> 02:57:16.274]  All I know is this is one of the strongest turmeric concentrates that's liquid that you take under the tongue
[02:57:16.534 --> 02:57:17.015]  We're good to go.
