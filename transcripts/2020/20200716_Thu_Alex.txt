[00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:17.891]  InfoWars was first to tell you decades ago that the EAS emergency systems would one day be on smartphones and would issue you different government directives.
[00:00:17.891 --> 00:00:22.895]  It's in my film, Police State 2 The Takeover, made in the year 2001.
[00:00:22.895 --> 00:00:27.319]  Well, now it's here, and it's directed by the UN bypassing the President.
[00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:32.423]  Here's messages folks across Michigan got last night.
[00:00:32.423 --> 00:00:34.425]  From the Michigan Executive Office of Governor.
[00:00:34.912 --> 00:00:37.238]  The state of Michigan, stay home, stay safe.
[00:00:37.238 --> 00:00:39.624]  Executive order takes effect at midnight tonight.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.681]  Non-essential travel is prohibited.
[00:00:42.681 --> 00:00:51.242]  As necessary, you may leave your home for health and safety reasons, to get groceries and supplies for certain outdoor activities, and to care for others.
[00:00:51.242 --> 00:00:56.883]  Businesses must limit in-person operations to those necessary to sustain or protect life.
[00:00:56.883 --> 00:01:04.085]  All individuals who leave their home or place of residence must adhere to social distancing measures recommended by the CDC.
[00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:09.586]  For additional guidance, see www.michigan.gov slash coronavirus.
[00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:22.424]  Starting in November, I began to start the broadcast each day with air raid sirens.
[00:01:22.424 --> 00:01:28.188]  I would normally only play air raid sirens maybe once a week or every few weeks when something particularly dangerous was going on.
[00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.470]  I wanted to get people's attention.
[00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:39.136]  I began playing them every day, sometimes multiple times daily in November because I want everybody to know as a symbol that we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:01:39.136 --> 00:01:39.677]  Just got chills.
[00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:54.489]  Now I've really been cogitating on what's going on, deeply thinking about the globalists and their operations, and going with all my research, and then just my gut, my spirit.
[00:01:54.489 --> 00:01:59.252]  And I just want to announce the globalists are getting their ass kicked up and down the street.
[00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:02.394]  There's global awakenings happening, incredibly good things are happening.
[00:02:02.394 --> 00:02:04.936]  If you turn on the news, you wouldn't know that.
[00:02:04.936 --> 00:02:08.239]  That said, the enemy knows they're losing.
[00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.540]  And a cornered demon
[00:02:10.307 --> 00:02:12.808]  It's extremely dangerous.
[00:02:12.808 --> 00:02:17.230]  And so we better have a discussion about how they're going to strike next.
[00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.953]  We said back in November, probably a bio attack.
[00:02:22.953 --> 00:02:29.836]  Economic collapse, hacking of infrastructure, blaming it on hackers, using that as a way to shut down speech further.
[00:02:31.738 --> 00:02:35.481]  I want to open the phones up and I want to shake the broadcast up just because it's the right thing to do.
[00:02:35.481 --> 00:02:38.463]  I don't like saying I'm going to take calls and give them the number out and then only get to 10 of them.
[00:02:38.463 --> 00:02:40.705]  We're going to take calls in the first hour.
[00:02:40.705 --> 00:02:49.911]  When we come out of break at 20 after, in the third segment, we're going to go directly to your phone calls on two subjects because I want to have a brainstorm here.
[00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:52.313]  That brings out the best of us.
[00:02:52.313 --> 00:02:54.755]  How are the globalists going to strike back next?
[00:02:54.755 --> 00:02:56.396]  What's the next scam?
[00:02:56.396 --> 00:02:58.638]  Remember back in November I said their impeachment is going to fail.
[00:02:59.482 --> 00:03:01.562]  They don't have the votes of the Senate, it's a fraud.
[00:03:01.562 --> 00:03:02.663]  What are they going to do next?
[00:03:02.663 --> 00:03:03.743]  What are they going to do next?
[00:03:03.743 --> 00:03:04.403]  What are they going to do next?
[00:03:04.403 --> 00:03:09.344]  And I said, economic collapse, war, bioweapon, all three.
[00:03:09.344 --> 00:03:09.884]  Race war.
[00:03:09.884 --> 00:03:13.625]  I mean, it's not hard to know what's in their quiver.
[00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:15.785]  What's in their clutch of arrows.
[00:03:15.785 --> 00:03:19.146]  But the question is, what card are they going to play next?
[00:03:19.146 --> 00:03:20.686]  We better put our thinking caps on.
[00:03:20.686 --> 00:03:25.107]  And then we should discuss, what does Trump need to do with 109 days out from the election?
[00:03:26.476 --> 00:03:27.537]  And what do we need to do?
[00:03:27.537 --> 00:03:28.417]  What can we do?
[00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:29.117]  What should we do?
[00:03:29.117 --> 00:03:30.698]  What should I do?
[00:03:30.698 --> 00:03:32.939]  Give me your ideas.
[00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:37.281]  And I'm not going to say thanks for your call and go through the whole song and dance because that takes up everybody's time.
[00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:38.022]  I love you all.
[00:03:38.022 --> 00:03:38.602]  I appreciate you all.
[00:03:38.602 --> 00:03:42.664]  I'm just going to go to you and just get it out and make your point and go on to the next person.
[00:03:42.664 --> 00:03:46.065]  Because I used to do shows 25 years ago, 26 years ago.
[00:03:46.065 --> 00:03:49.287]  The first five years of the show, man, I was good at taking a lot of calls.
[00:03:49.287 --> 00:03:51.048]  I'd take 100 calls during a show.
[00:03:51.048 --> 00:03:53.269]  Just bam, bam, I'd control the phone board myself.
[00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:57.883]  They just got the person's name and where they were calling from.
[00:03:57.883 --> 00:04:01.564]  And over the years, we have a lot of great callers, but things have degenerated where I don't go to enough calls.
[00:04:01.564 --> 00:04:05.186]  I've got a little bit better, but I really want to just knock it out of the park today.
[00:04:05.186 --> 00:04:07.827]  So we'll give the number out when we come back.
[00:04:07.827 --> 00:04:11.908]  I'll plow through all the headlines and what's coming up in the second hour.
[00:04:11.908 --> 00:04:13.129]  I'm going to hit all this news.
[00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:18.585]  in the second hour and continue with your calls.
[00:04:18.585 --> 00:04:22.708]  And we have a special guest in studio that's running against one of the top globalist Democrats.
[00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:24.710]  We'll tell you about that coming up as well.
[00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.733]  But please remember, without your support of InfoWars, we wouldn't still be here.
[00:04:28.733 --> 00:04:29.854]  And it's true.
[00:04:29.854 --> 00:04:39.202]  This show, the stories, the reports, our guests, the calls have absolutely changed the world in an ultra, ultra massive way.
[00:04:40.424 --> 00:04:44.208]  So I want to salute you all and thank you all for your ongoing support and your diligence.
[00:04:44.208 --> 00:04:51.155]  Because when you tell people about the local radio stations, when you spread the word about InfoWars.com and NewsWars.com and Bandai Video, it changes the world.
[00:04:51.155 --> 00:04:53.658]  It is changing the world and we're winning together.
[00:04:53.658 --> 00:04:56.361]  So I want to thank you all and salute you and tell you, kick it up a notch.
[00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:09.540]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history, that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:18.770]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property, because we've had it so long, and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:33.294]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[00:05:33.294 --> 00:05:47.499]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the Earth and we need to be culled and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:49.641]  And that's what COVID-19 is.
[00:05:49.641 --> 00:05:56.508]  A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity, and against your future.
[00:05:56.508 --> 00:05:58.090]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.846]  Welcome my friends, welcome and thank you so much for joining us on this live Thursday, July 16th.
[00:06:27.846 --> 00:06:31.168]  2020 transmission, 109 days out.
[00:06:31.168 --> 00:06:34.431]  This is the final countdown.
[00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:39.856]  All right, I am going to open the phones up throughout the next four hours.
[00:06:39.856 --> 00:06:41.637]  Matt Bracken joins us in the fourth hour.
[00:06:41.637 --> 00:06:46.342]  We have another gentleman joining us that's running against one of the top Democrats in the country in studio.
[00:06:46.342 --> 00:06:47.763]  Tell you about that coming up a little bit later.
[00:06:49.087 --> 00:06:57.331]  There is so much to get to, but the good news is Trump is really making all the right decisions right now with 109 days left.
[00:06:57.331 --> 00:07:09.357]  I'd say at about 120 days out, about 10 days ago, we saw Trump start going with his instincts and not Jared Kushner and not Brad Parscale.
[00:07:09.357 --> 00:07:14.780]  And I can tell you, both of them are bad news.
[00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:18.662]  Parscale is a delusional idiot.
[00:07:19.929 --> 00:07:25.333]  Who is into himself and thinks he got Trump elected, but he's not evil.
[00:07:25.333 --> 00:07:43.869]  Jared Kushner and Ivanka are amateurs who are constantly meeting with Big Tech and Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan like they're their friends and they leak like a sieve and they are just unbelievably naive as well.
[00:07:45.049 --> 00:07:48.472]  And I don't sit there and attack these individuals with pleasure.
[00:07:48.472 --> 00:07:54.036]  I do it because they need to be out of the decision-making processes.
[00:07:54.036 --> 00:08:00.280]  Now, we elected President Trump, not Brad Parscale.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.882]  I know it's impressive that he's eight feet tall.
[00:08:02.882 --> 00:08:06.725]  And we also did not elect Ivanka or Jared.
[00:08:07.708 --> 00:08:11.350]  Parscale, out as Trump campaign manager, demoted to senior advisor.
[00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.791]  I know folks that know him in Florida.
[00:08:12.791 --> 00:08:16.332]  He's a nice guy, friendly guy, buys some good ads for Trump.
[00:08:16.332 --> 00:08:17.373]  That's about it.
[00:08:17.373 --> 00:08:20.174]  Buys a bunch of Lamborghinis and Ferraris and has parties all night long.
[00:08:20.174 --> 00:08:20.955]  Okay, great, dude.
[00:08:20.955 --> 00:08:22.656]  That's wonderful.
[00:08:22.656 --> 00:08:26.798]  He talks about, oh, you know, the dynasty of the Trumps and how they're invincible.
[00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:29.179]  Bull crap, buddy boy.
[00:08:29.179 --> 00:08:30.480]  We are in the fight of our lives.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.122]  We don't need sunshine patriots dancing around when we're in so much trouble.
[00:08:35.122 --> 00:08:36.703]  Glad you've been demoted to advisor.
[00:08:38.467 --> 00:08:41.269]  And I'm telling you, Kushner's been kicked to the curb as well.
[00:08:41.269 --> 00:08:43.990]  Because Kushner is an amateur.
[00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:48.133]  Just like his father was an amateur.
[00:08:48.133 --> 00:08:50.674]  Absolute amateurs, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:08:50.674 --> 00:08:53.816]  But they believe their own BS.
[00:08:53.816 --> 00:08:55.537]  That's all coming up.
[00:08:55.537 --> 00:08:57.078]  Let me give you some more good news.
[00:08:57.078 --> 00:09:04.262]  All over the United States, we are seeing a major, major repudiation
[00:09:06.753 --> 00:09:07.033]  I don't know.
[00:09:25.137 --> 00:09:30.080]  And now all these governors in Louisiana, I mean, it's all happening.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.121]  People are calling it out and saying it's a fraud.
[00:09:33.121 --> 00:09:39.825]  Georgia governor bans mask mandates, says they're unconstitutional and they don't work and they're a joke.
[00:09:39.825 --> 00:09:41.305]  Flatly violates due process.
[00:09:41.305 --> 00:09:47.689]  Louisiana Attorney General says Democrat governor mask mandate likely unconstitutional.
[00:09:49.758 --> 00:10:04.870]  Trump admin tells hospitals to bypass CDC, send data directly to HHS because it's the CDC that set the policy through the UN to count everybody that dies of gunshot wounds, car wrecks, cancer, you name it, as COVID-19.
[00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:15.954]  And to create all these false positives under the CDC-UN guidelines to say if one person has it, then you count 15 more people around them saying they have it.
[00:10:15.954 --> 00:10:21.135]  Or if you have a sore throat or sniffles, no need to be tested, you have COVID-19.
[00:10:21.135 --> 00:10:24.656]  When we covered that three weeks ago, I thought we were breaking it.
[00:10:24.656 --> 00:10:28.938]  And we got flooded with articles and news going, you didn't know this, Jones?
[00:10:28.938 --> 00:10:30.298]  Yeah, I knew they were doing it.
[00:10:30.298 --> 00:10:32.879]  I didn't know that it was official and had been in the newspapers.
[00:10:33.683 --> 00:10:37.066]  They're like, yeah, we just randomly, if you have a sore throat, no need to come in.
[00:10:37.066 --> 00:10:38.647]  We just say you have it.
[00:10:38.647 --> 00:10:40.168]  What?
[00:10:40.168 --> 00:10:42.370]  Of course it's spiking, but the deaths aren't.
[00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.533]  Because it's BS.
[00:10:45.533 --> 00:10:48.335]  This is such incredibly good news right here.
[00:10:48.335 --> 00:10:51.838]  Why are so many NYPD officers refusing to wear masks at protests?
[00:10:51.838 --> 00:10:53.279]  The New York Times asked.
[00:10:53.279 --> 00:10:57.503]  It's a photo of about 50 police officers and two of them are wearing the dumb mask.
[00:10:57.503 --> 00:10:58.504]  And the cops have been talking.
[00:10:58.504 --> 00:10:59.725]  They say it's all a hoax.
[00:11:02.415 --> 00:11:07.916]  Georgia Governor Brian Kemp bans cities, counties from mandating masks.
[00:11:07.916 --> 00:11:11.097]  A woman refutes Bill Nye the Science Guy's mask propaganda.
[00:11:11.097 --> 00:11:19.999]  Hey, Bill Nye edited his old shows from the 90s and says there aren't just male and female chromosomes, and he said chromosomes don't decide sex.
[00:11:19.999 --> 00:11:25.540]  That's like saying water isn't H2O and isn't a molecule.
[00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.260]  I mean, it's a war on reality.
[00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:29.671]  So we've got all that news.
[00:11:29.671 --> 00:11:37.779]  Meanwhile, California to release 18,000 prisoners, many of them violent, by end of August to vote, of course, to slow the spread of COVID-19.
[00:11:37.779 --> 00:11:43.184]  But if you are out without your mask or bigger than a group of 10 people, you will go to jail, he says.
[00:11:43.184 --> 00:11:45.846]  Of course.
[00:11:45.846 --> 00:11:48.429]  Big article up on Gateway Pundit.
[00:11:50.179 --> 00:11:59.286]  Gateway Pundit's Joe Hoff, the man who first exposed COVID-19 hoax, says New York Governor Cuomo should be investigated and looked at for murder.
[00:11:59.286 --> 00:12:01.608]  Big Info Wars interview on the Gateway Pundit.
[00:12:01.608 --> 00:12:08.554]  You know the White House is going to be watching that because Trump loves the Gateway Pundit.
[00:12:08.554 --> 00:12:15.219]  Meanwhile, COVID lockdowns to trigger massive wave of evictions as culture and society breaks down.
[00:12:15.219 --> 00:12:16.960]  Meanwhile, Moderna COVID-19 vaccine
[00:12:19.184 --> 00:12:23.465]  Induced adverse reactions in more than half of trial participants.
[00:12:23.465 --> 00:12:25.706]  Gates said it's gonna make a lot of people sick.
[00:12:25.706 --> 00:12:29.847]  But Media Matters had an article out last week saying Jones made it up.
[00:12:29.847 --> 00:12:33.268]  That there's adverse reactions in the vaccine.
[00:12:33.268 --> 00:12:36.028]  And that Gates said a lot of people will be hurt.
[00:12:36.028 --> 00:12:37.369]  Yeah, he said 700,000.
[00:12:37.369 --> 00:12:39.189]  I have the clip.
[00:12:39.189 --> 00:12:43.931]  But oh, Media Matters said I'm lying, so it's true.
[00:12:43.931 --> 00:12:45.411]  That's all coming up meanwhile.
[00:12:47.435 --> 00:12:50.917]  Missouri Senator Hawley asked DOJ to open civil rights investigation to St.
[00:12:50.917 --> 00:12:54.858]  Louis Circuit Attorney Office for targeting the McCloskeys.
[00:12:54.858 --> 00:13:02.402]  They've now, as you know, raided them and they're now moving forward to indict them.
[00:13:02.402 --> 00:13:07.024]  Their own home broken into, their own gate broken into, a mob screaming racial epithets at them.
[00:13:07.024 --> 00:13:09.125]  They say, get off my land.
[00:13:09.125 --> 00:13:12.966]  And she's investigating them and moving forward.
[00:13:12.966 --> 00:13:13.366]  Unbelievable.
[00:13:13.366 --> 00:13:16.408]  We'll be breaking all of that down coming up as well.
[00:13:17.435 --> 00:13:26.757]  There's some other really huge pedophile news that I will hit after I take calls next segment.
[00:13:26.757 --> 00:13:34.859]  More and more of these Hollywood people on, like the director of Guardians of the Galaxy, had pedophile-themed parties and talked about screwing kids all over Twitter.
[00:13:34.859 --> 00:13:37.059]  Remember that?
[00:13:37.059 --> 00:13:40.660]  Well, we've got somebody else out talking about how she gets off on looking at little girls.
[00:13:41.601 --> 00:13:42.882]  And how she gets sexually excited.
[00:13:42.882 --> 00:13:45.684]  She's a good friend of Jeffrey Epstein and Gasoline Maxwell.
[00:13:45.684 --> 00:13:53.191]  So we're going to be talking about this individual coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:13:53.191 --> 00:13:55.432]  Chrissy Teigen.
[00:13:55.432 --> 00:14:03.599]  And boy, how she's been caught red-handed along with Nike with hidden images of kidnapped children in their advertising.
[00:14:03.599 --> 00:14:06.301]  Of course, if you know where to look, it's not hidden.
[00:14:06.301 --> 00:14:08.763]  It's all part of the club.
[00:14:08.763 --> 00:14:10.285]  All part of the sick, sick club.
[00:14:10.285 --> 00:14:10.565]  All right.
[00:14:11.946 --> 00:14:29.094]  I want to open the phones up on what Trump should do to counter the globalists, what we should do to counter the globalists in this critical time worldwide, not just here in the U.S., and how you think the deep state's going to strike back next as their COVID hoax really does fall apart even as they try to squeeze us into COVID lockdown 2.0.
[00:14:31.496 --> 00:14:34.479]  I want to take your calls.
[00:14:34.479 --> 00:14:35.479]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:14:35.479 --> 00:14:39.243]  That's 877-789-2539.
[00:14:39.243 --> 00:14:41.344]  First-time callers, long-time callers.
[00:14:41.344 --> 00:14:47.670]  If you were on hold yesterday when the show ended, I didn't get to five or six callers, call back in and go to the other line.
[00:14:47.670 --> 00:14:48.090]  877-789-ALEX.
[00:14:48.090 --> 00:14:48.430]  877-789-2539.
[00:14:48.430 --> 00:14:56.677]  A lot of folks can call internationally with a 1-800, but if you can't in your country, dial the country access code and 512-646-1776.
[00:15:00.879 --> 00:15:02.081]  There's a lot more too.
[00:15:02.081 --> 00:15:04.446]  What's behind the big Twitter hack?
[00:15:04.446 --> 00:15:10.097]  I've got a good idea and I'm going to be going over some of that as well.
[00:15:11.024 --> 00:15:17.287]  And we've got a big stack of news about the confirmation of millions have starved to death since the COVID lockdown.
[00:15:17.287 --> 00:15:18.347]  Not from COVID!
[00:15:18.347 --> 00:15:19.568]  COVID didn't cause it.
[00:15:19.568 --> 00:15:26.111]  The globalist lockdown of the Western economies and the third world economies has caused unbelievable death.
[00:15:26.111 --> 00:15:34.135]  If you believe the official numbers of 500,000 dead worldwide from COVID, we're already talking five, six times that number have died from the starvation.
[00:15:34.955 --> 00:15:40.358]  Which is exactly what every leftist wants, is to kill and starve as many people as they can.
[00:15:40.358 --> 00:15:50.142]  They are the most selfish, ugly, stupid, hateful, murderous, devil-worshipping people on earth, because they are of their father, Satan.
[00:15:50.142 --> 00:15:53.724]  And they will be with their father and love death forever.
[00:15:53.724 --> 00:15:55.685]  Stay with us.
[00:15:55.685 --> 00:16:01.328]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:16:01.328 --> 00:16:04.089]  You can wear them out to political events, you can trigger libtards,
[00:16:04.642 --> 00:16:11.787]  One of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween.
[00:16:11.787 --> 00:16:18.031]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[00:16:18.031 --> 00:16:23.615]  It's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the forced inoculations and contact tracing of their openly.
[00:16:23.976 --> 00:16:24.417]  I'm good.
[00:16:35.191 --> 00:16:39.595]  It's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing.
[00:16:39.595 --> 00:16:43.418]  And the M95 mask only controls what's coming in, not what's going out.
[00:16:43.418 --> 00:16:45.500]  So they quote, spread COVID-19.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.981]  They don't protect from it.
[00:16:46.981 --> 00:16:49.944]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back in these control freak spaces.
[00:16:49.944 --> 00:16:52.586]  You buy one for $9.95, you get four more free.
[00:16:52.586 --> 00:16:53.587]  They're at cost.
[00:16:53.587 --> 00:16:54.989]  Infowarrestore.com.
[00:16:56.118 --> 00:16:57.559]  It's Christmas in July.
[00:16:57.559 --> 00:16:58.800]  We ran the sale last year.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:00.561]  It was very, very popular.
[00:17:00.561 --> 00:17:06.846]  And so, I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election year.
[00:17:06.846 --> 00:17:12.370]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:17.994]  It's the American Eagle, boldly spreading its wings, sitting atop a Betsy Ross flag.
[00:17:17.994 --> 00:17:20.655]  And the shirts are on sale right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:17:21.776 --> 00:17:27.904]  I got the idea from the Trump campaign of having a similar sort of media called Nazi, which of course it isn't.
[00:17:27.904 --> 00:17:32.550]  And since it's so triggering to the leftist and globalist, well, we're going to make sure there's even more of these on the streets.
[00:17:33.402 --> 00:17:34.903]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:18:19.713 --> 00:18:21.533]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:22.134]  to 3 p.m.
[00:18:22.134 --> 00:18:22.754]  I'm here live.
[00:18:22.754 --> 00:18:24.254]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:18:24.254 --> 00:18:27.855]  David Knight knocks out of the park every weekday morning, 8 a.m.
[00:18:27.855 --> 00:18:28.035]  11 a.m.
[00:18:28.035 --> 00:18:29.175]  right before me.
[00:18:29.175 --> 00:18:30.776]  Nobody prepares for a show like David Knight.
[00:18:30.776 --> 00:18:31.996]  That guy knows his stuff.
[00:18:31.996 --> 00:18:34.016]  And then, The War Room with Owen Stroyer.
[00:18:34.016 --> 00:18:36.777]  And now, Roger Stone was on yesterday.
[00:18:36.777 --> 00:18:38.197]  Laid out some exclusive info.
[00:18:38.197 --> 00:18:42.238]  We'll be playing at the start of the next hour.
[00:18:42.238 --> 00:18:48.460]  Next segment, I'm going to get into more Hollywood operatives outing themselves as wanting to have sex with children.
[00:18:50.199 --> 00:18:51.521]  They just can't help themselves.
[00:18:51.521 --> 00:18:58.532]  And as the public begins to investigate, every rock you turn over you find it because it's a cult.
[00:18:58.532 --> 00:19:01.015]  That's their plan.
[00:19:01.015 --> 00:19:01.716]  How do you say her name?
[00:19:01.716 --> 00:19:02.517]  Chrissy Teigen?
[00:19:04.246 --> 00:19:07.707]  I don't follow these people, but I know who this moron is.
[00:19:07.707 --> 00:19:12.149]  Seeing little girdles in the splits, half naked, is just... I want to put myself in jail.
[00:19:12.149 --> 00:19:19.971]  And folks, there's a lot of parents that are nice and like their kids and cheerleading when they're young or, you know, in the glamour stuff because they really think it's cute and funny.
[00:19:19.971 --> 00:19:25.173]  But then they're blind right next to the pedophiles, having no idea that that's what it is.
[00:19:25.173 --> 00:19:27.474]  That's what it is.
[00:19:27.474 --> 00:19:27.914]  It's sick.
[00:19:29.019 --> 00:19:30.200]  What do you think happened with JonBenet Ramsey?
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.140]  What do you think is happening with all this stuff?
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:33.361]  It's a cult!
[00:19:33.361 --> 00:19:34.722]  All right, I'm going to stop.
[00:19:34.722 --> 00:19:40.624]  I'm going to go to your phone calls right now, ladies and gentlemen, because I want to hear what you have to say.
[00:19:40.624 --> 00:19:46.647]  I want to get the focus for our audience and I know the White House listens and others about what does Trump need to do?
[00:19:46.647 --> 00:19:49.348]  What do we need to do with 109 days out?
[00:19:49.348 --> 00:19:50.749]  And how is the deep state going to strike back?
[00:19:50.749 --> 00:19:54.051]  Because I can tell you, I'll cover this later, but I want to get the calls now.
[00:19:54.051 --> 00:19:54.671]  They're losing.
[00:19:55.799 --> 00:19:57.840]  You saw some of the evidence of it.
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:20:01.343]  As the police won't wear the mask, not just in New York, but all over the country.
[00:20:01.343 --> 00:20:04.064]  The military is refusing to wear the mask because they know it's bull.
[00:20:04.064 --> 00:20:08.567]  Yeah, everybody tests positive and no one's sick.
[00:20:08.567 --> 00:20:15.512]  Or if you do get the problem, you go take Benadryl, or you get an EpiPen, or you inhale steroids, and you're boom, you're fine.
[00:20:15.512 --> 00:20:18.313]  It's an autoimmune response, whatever it is.
[00:20:18.313 --> 00:20:25.038]  And the studies show, three years ago, that 5G tested in Wuhan was causing autoimmune response in the lungs.
[00:20:26.189 --> 00:20:27.510]  Like altitude sickness.
[00:20:27.510 --> 00:20:30.771]  And the people felt like someone was sitting on their chest.
[00:20:30.771 --> 00:20:32.752]  And David Icke came out and said that.
[00:20:32.752 --> 00:20:35.294]  He said he just got it from the ether.
[00:20:35.294 --> 00:20:38.615]  He's something else.
[00:20:38.615 --> 00:20:42.718]  And then people were calling me going, you had guest on three years ago about this.
[00:20:42.718 --> 00:20:47.300]  Doctors on about this and people found the articles and not from us, mainline science.
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:50.822]  So 5G is involved in it.
[00:20:50.822 --> 00:20:52.923]  Plus the headlines admit 5G lowers your immune system.
[00:20:54.138 --> 00:20:57.659]  But when you're in 5G, folks, it doesn't go very far, but it's super strong.
[00:20:57.659 --> 00:21:01.000]  It penetrates everything, every cell, everything.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.800]  And your lungs don't know how to handle it.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:03.580]  Is there a virus?
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:04.121]  Is it real?
[00:21:04.121 --> 00:21:04.641]  Yes, yes.
[00:21:04.641 --> 00:21:07.621]  There's a bunch of stuff going on, but it appears to be binary.
[00:21:07.621 --> 00:21:10.882]  And in the 5G, it affects it a lot worse.
[00:21:10.882 --> 00:21:12.823]  Okay, let's go to your calls.
[00:21:12.823 --> 00:21:15.844]  Justin, Pastor Sam, Presley, Kenny, Andre.
[00:21:15.844 --> 00:21:18.664]  Folks aren't used to me taking calls early, are they?
[00:21:18.664 --> 00:21:19.685]  Well, we're doing it.
[00:21:19.685 --> 00:21:21.105]  Let's go ahead and take a call.
[00:21:25.535 --> 00:21:32.364]  Global war is on right now, Alex.
[00:21:32.364 --> 00:21:42.417]  I know that America is jaded from all the sandbox wars, that we've seen the Bush wars, we've seen the Clinton wars, and the last thing that we want is another war, but right now
[00:21:42.935 --> 00:21:44.756]  The envelope is pushing forward.
[00:21:44.756 --> 00:21:47.037]  It's coming out into open combat.
[00:21:47.037 --> 00:21:47.638]  This is something.
[00:21:47.638 --> 00:21:47.958]  That's right.
[00:21:47.958 --> 00:21:56.123]  We're in a real existential war with the globalists and the chi-coms are the physical sword of the new world order and we're at war and Trump's fighting.
[00:21:56.123 --> 00:21:57.383]  They absolutely are.
[00:21:57.383 --> 00:22:07.129]  You know, we're in a, in a, uh, an arms race for flat top carriers, which a lot of people don't know that the one burning in San Diego now for the fourth day,
[00:22:07.643 --> 00:22:08.545]  That's right.
[00:22:08.545 --> 00:22:14.855]  Those are the type that you need to move troops into the South China Sea and tag islands.
[00:22:19.873 --> 00:22:21.594]  And for F-35s.
[00:22:21.594 --> 00:22:23.355]  You know, the British have one.
[00:22:23.355 --> 00:22:24.835]  It's still not operational.
[00:22:24.835 --> 00:22:26.896]  It's still got Marine Corps pilots.
[00:22:26.896 --> 00:22:32.659]  The Japanese said in 2012, we're building helicopter-carrying destroyers.
[00:22:32.659 --> 00:22:38.482]  And the Chinese freaked out and said, oh no, you're going to put jump jets on them someday.
[00:22:38.482 --> 00:22:43.244]  2018, Trump and Melania, it was really nice of the First Lady to come along and kick all the tires.
[00:22:43.564 --> 00:22:46.286]  That's right, and now magically it's on fire.
[00:22:46.286 --> 00:22:48.769]  Don't think for a minute that's probably not sabotage.
[00:22:48.769 --> 00:22:53.993]  I haven't covered that yet because we're not 100% sure, but the smart folks think that was probably set on fire on purpose.
[00:23:04.875 --> 00:23:10.460]  The Iranian general all but admitted it and the quotations are on Hal Turner's website.
[00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:14.484]  Well that's right, they said we're going to start sabotaging you for Israel blowing up their nuclear site.
[00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:19.471]  You know, seven of their ships caught fire yesterday in the Iranian harbor.
[00:23:19.471 --> 00:23:21.932]  So Trump's using the space-based weapons.
[00:23:21.932 --> 00:23:24.273]  I wish all the patriots would just get on board.
[00:23:24.273 --> 00:23:28.014]  We've got a bad taste from these sandbox wars, but now we've got to fight for our life.
[00:23:28.014 --> 00:23:29.014]  Well, I mean, here's the deal.
[00:23:29.014 --> 00:23:29.894]  Here's the deal.
[00:23:29.894 --> 00:23:30.494]  It's on.
[00:23:30.494 --> 00:23:32.055]  And the big banks are bet on China.
[00:23:32.055 --> 00:23:33.675]  The globalists are bet on China.
[00:23:33.675 --> 00:23:34.996]  And all these idiots are bet on China.
[00:23:34.996 --> 00:23:35.796]  They're going to lose.
[00:23:36.696 --> 00:23:43.602]  And so all these idiot race rioters funded by Soros and all the Antifa people and BLM, you're idiots!
[00:23:43.602 --> 00:23:49.527]  We're in a war with China and Iran and the globalists are backing them.
[00:23:49.527 --> 00:23:51.628]  The Clintons and Obama are backing Iran.
[00:23:51.628 --> 00:23:53.610]  They've got spies inside our government.
[00:23:53.610 --> 00:23:56.072]  They gave China the Office of Personnel hack.
[00:23:56.072 --> 00:23:57.333]  24 million U.S.
[00:23:57.333 --> 00:23:58.634]  government and their families.
[00:23:58.634 --> 00:24:00.336]  We have been totally penetrated.
[00:24:00.336 --> 00:24:02.357]  And we either stand up and say no or it's over.
[00:24:02.357 --> 00:24:04.419]  And that's why all Americans should understand
[00:24:04.699 --> 00:24:07.904]  You're not going to have a good way of life under the globalist control.
[00:24:07.904 --> 00:24:11.730]  If you were just a sociopath, you would not want to be under the New World Order.
[00:24:11.730 --> 00:24:12.511]  You'd want America.
[00:24:12.511 --> 00:24:14.273]  This is so stupid.
[00:24:14.273 --> 00:24:19.441]  There's no reason anyone should want to be with globalism, unless you want to be poor and a slave.
[00:24:19.441 --> 00:24:20.303]  These people are idiots.
[00:24:21.818 --> 00:24:26.062]  On wartime footing, we can lock up all the traitors, even in our own country.
[00:24:26.062 --> 00:24:30.645]  As long as we're still pretending that we're a peacetime nation, then it's going to be a threat.
[00:24:30.645 --> 00:24:31.326]  Well, I'll say this.
[00:24:31.326 --> 00:24:33.808]  I'm not for just locking people up, but here's the problem.
[00:24:33.808 --> 00:24:40.714]  The ADL and Southern Broadway Law Center are on TV saying, we're going to arrest everybody we don't like when we take over, and we're going to end the country.
[00:24:40.714 --> 00:24:41.895]  So they've already brought us here.
[00:24:42.355 --> 00:24:42.776]  See, you're right.
[00:24:42.776 --> 00:24:43.697]  We're in a war.
[00:24:43.697 --> 00:24:44.879]  We're in a domestic war.
[00:24:44.879 --> 00:24:46.841]  We're hanging on by our fingernails.
[00:24:46.841 --> 00:24:49.184]  If this degenerates, it's going to explode even faster.
[00:24:49.184 --> 00:24:55.032]  I predict if they take Trump out, there's going to be a power fight inside the globalists, and they're going to double-cross China regardless.
[00:24:55.032 --> 00:24:56.995]  The globalists, all they do is fight with each other.
[00:24:56.995 --> 00:24:58.157]  And this is a disaster.
[00:24:58.157 --> 00:24:58.858]  It has to stop.
[00:24:59.238 --> 00:25:03.201]  We have to have strength out of the President, strength out of the military, strength out of the people.
[00:25:03.201 --> 00:25:10.387]  And we need every citizen during this war, instead of locked in your house, scared of COVID, to be on the streets, saying no to the New World Order.
[00:25:10.387 --> 00:25:12.489]  And look, it's not about worshipping the police.
[00:25:12.489 --> 00:25:13.710]  They're local government.
[00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:17.233]  They're the symbol of the lowest level of government, of our rule.
[00:25:17.233 --> 00:25:21.016]  They want to overthrow the police, not to get rid of them, but to make them bow to them.
[00:25:21.016 --> 00:25:22.057]  It's in the news today.
[00:25:22.057 --> 00:25:23.118]  Patrick Samson, you raised this.
[00:25:24.144 --> 00:25:31.408]  The official plan of Soros and the old State Department plan and the old Justice Department plan is to literally have U.N.
[00:25:31.408 --> 00:25:42.515]  rules and an ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, clash where they go through the background of any current police or future police and if they're even a Trump supporter, they can't be a police officer.
[00:25:42.515 --> 00:25:43.775]  That's called hate.
[00:25:43.775 --> 00:25:45.677]  Literal political litmus test.
[00:25:46.357 --> 00:25:47.378]  Last point on this.
[00:25:47.378 --> 00:25:52.662]  While all that is happening in the United States within the last 24 hours, we sent another destroyer right up into Nicolas Maduro's face.
[00:26:10.279 --> 00:26:10.860]  I think so.
[00:26:29.557 --> 00:26:32.339]  You know, we've got all our new weapons right there in the Caribbean.
[00:26:32.339 --> 00:26:38.422]  Well, listen, I'm not a pro-war guy until we're in a real war, and we are in a real war, and all these globalists respect the strength.
[00:26:38.422 --> 00:26:43.925]  That's all Venezuela, all the Chi-coms, all North Korea respects, and we have to do what we have to do.
[00:26:43.925 --> 00:26:44.805]  I can tell you that right now.
[00:26:44.805 --> 00:26:46.686]  I don't want to start a war, but they already started it.
[00:26:46.686 --> 00:26:48.027]  We'll be right back with your phone calls.
[00:26:48.027 --> 00:26:50.008]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[00:26:50.008 --> 00:26:51.248]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:26:51.248 --> 00:26:52.129]  We are at war, folks.
[00:26:54.147 --> 00:26:56.729]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years.
[00:26:56.729 --> 00:27:09.537]  And if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict,
[00:27:10.177 --> 00:27:10.998]  We're good to go.
[00:27:30.094 --> 00:27:34.078]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up.
[00:27:34.078 --> 00:27:39.323]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate-level blueprint documents.
[00:27:39.323 --> 00:27:47.190]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:51.014]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[00:27:51.014 --> 00:27:53.076]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[00:27:54.739 --> 00:27:59.943]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[00:27:59.943 --> 00:28:04.247]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[00:28:04.247 --> 00:28:08.690]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:16.457]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breathe air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against the dangerous toxins and viruses in the air.
[00:28:17.077 --> 00:28:24.726]  Powerful, quiet, and effective, the Breathe uses a four-step purification process to help you breathe easier and cleaner.
[00:28:24.726 --> 00:28:32.855]  Similar systems could cost hundreds to even thousands of dollars, but the Alexa Pure Breathe air purification is the best and most affordable bar none.
[00:28:33.656 --> 00:28:41.722]  The breeze and the ion cluster patented technology used in the system eliminate up to 99.97% of airborne contaminants.

[00:28:49.368 --> 00:28:53.311]  Get this special today at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:28:53.311 --> 00:28:57.434]  The reasons that the globalists launch this planetary lockdown.
[00:28:57.434 --> 00:29:01.637]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[00:29:01.637 --> 00:29:02.298]  We've gone over
[00:29:02.639 --> 00:29:06.081]  Those purposes many times here on air.
[00:29:06.081 --> 00:29:12.144]  The cashless society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[00:29:12.144 --> 00:29:28.392]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[00:29:28.392 --> 00:29:31.854]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[00:29:32.443 --> 00:29:37.825]  It's been pre-planned, organized, globally, and it's extremely predatory.
[00:29:37.825 --> 00:29:49.609]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[00:29:49.609 --> 00:29:56.572]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[00:29:56.572 --> 00:29:59.233]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:30:30.797 --> 00:30:32.558]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live.
[00:30:32.558 --> 00:30:39.260]  I am your host, Alex Jones, and I'm going to cover the Chrissy Teigen story next segment.
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.181]  Hopefully.
[00:30:40.181 --> 00:30:42.001]  And we're going to lay all this out.
[00:30:42.001 --> 00:30:47.764]  But right now, we're taking your phone calls about what does President Trump need to do
[00:30:48.905 --> 00:30:50.927]  What do we need to do with 109 days out?
[00:30:50.927 --> 00:30:52.388]  And how are the globalists going to strike back?
[00:30:52.388 --> 00:31:00.436]  Because I think they're losing right now on many fronts, but they're launching military probes that are asymmetrical, that are covert.
[00:31:00.436 --> 00:31:05.861]  They're launching economic attacks, hack attacks, culture war, economic war.
[00:31:05.861 --> 00:31:07.743]  I mean, it's on.
[00:31:07.743 --> 00:31:13.129]  To break the will of this country and bring us into the one world government, the carbon taxes, the sexualization of our children.
[00:31:14.386 --> 00:31:19.649]  I've got news on that front that's going to blow you away, but that's next segment, and it ties together.
[00:31:19.649 --> 00:31:31.355]  They are now forcefully giving boys sex changes with chemicals when they say they don't want it.
[00:31:31.355 --> 00:31:40.260]  Not just the parents, the government, and not just in England where it all comes from, Tavistock Institute, but here in America.
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:41.020]  That's coming up.
[00:31:43.655 --> 00:31:44.315]  Next segment.
[00:31:44.315 --> 00:31:46.036]  But first, let's go to your calls.
[00:31:46.036 --> 00:31:52.958]  Now, I said I'd take a lot of calls, and I spent a whole segment with one caller because he was making great points, but let's just try to roll through folks as fast as possible here.
[00:31:52.958 --> 00:31:54.539]  David in California, you're on the air.
[00:31:54.539 --> 00:31:59.141]  Welcome.
[00:31:59.141 --> 00:32:02.702]  All right, I'm gonna let you go.
[00:32:02.702 --> 00:32:03.963]  I appreciate your call, David.
[00:32:03.963 --> 00:32:05.663]  Gotta turn that radio off.
[00:32:05.663 --> 00:32:06.704]  That's not how you listen.
[00:32:06.704 --> 00:32:07.784]  That's all delayed.
[00:32:07.784 --> 00:32:09.004]  Let David go.
[00:32:09.004 --> 00:32:11.445]  We're gonna take a lot of calls here.
[00:32:11.445 --> 00:32:12.826]  All right, I'm gonna take another caller now.
[00:32:14.312 --> 00:32:18.835]  I'm going to talk to Justin here in a second, then I'm going to talk to Presley, then I'm going to talk to Kenny, then I'm going to talk to Andre.
[00:32:18.835 --> 00:32:19.695]  Okay?
[00:32:19.695 --> 00:32:21.456]  And we're going to go to Justin in Indiana now.
[00:32:21.456 --> 00:32:22.237]  Justin, you're on the air.
[00:32:22.237 --> 00:32:24.198]  Welcome.
[00:32:24.198 --> 00:32:24.738]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:32:24.738 --> 00:32:25.498]  You take my call.
[00:32:25.498 --> 00:32:26.499]  I greatly appreciate it.
[00:32:26.499 --> 00:32:29.641]  Thank you.
[00:32:29.641 --> 00:32:34.524]  Everyone needs to be aware that they have two different kinds of polls.
[00:32:34.524 --> 00:32:40.147]  Internal polling and then the fake polls that they release to the public.
[00:32:40.147 --> 00:32:41.648]  Biden's leading according to that.
[00:32:42.509 --> 00:32:45.211]  Their internal polls might show something different here soon.
[00:32:45.211 --> 00:32:49.255]  And if that does happen, which it will, Trump is leading right now.
[00:32:49.255 --> 00:32:55.941]  So they're going to do something, you know, as far as the COVID cases go, they're going to turn those up.
[00:32:55.941 --> 00:33:03.648]  They're going to say there's more deaths just to get us to roll over even more and make mask mandates everywhere.
[00:33:03.648 --> 00:33:05.690]  You're not going to be able to go anywhere without one.
[00:33:07.779 --> 00:33:13.784]  And that's why Trump is taking control of the numbers because the UN is in control of the NIH and CDC.
[00:33:13.784 --> 00:33:21.891]  So Trump has to have Health and Human Services actually do it himself and change the policy of someone has the sniffles, you call it COVID-19.
[00:33:21.891 --> 00:33:23.732]  That's how they're creating this fraud.
[00:33:23.732 --> 00:33:25.133]  And Trump's doing the right thing.
[00:33:25.133 --> 00:33:27.215]  He sidelined Fauci.
[00:33:27.215 --> 00:33:28.976]  Now he's discrediting Fauci.
[00:33:28.976 --> 00:33:33.560]  And then now he has to come out and point out Fauci owns part of the vaccine with Bill Gates.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.381]  That has to be done.
[00:33:35.805 --> 00:33:41.006]  Yeah, and that definitely goes to show you just how much Trump has control.
[00:33:41.006 --> 00:33:44.927]  Because, I mean, we know that he would get rid of Fauci because he knows.
[00:33:44.927 --> 00:33:48.007]  So, but it's just, that's how deep the deep state is.
[00:33:48.007 --> 00:33:54.468]  It's just, he can't just let him go and jail him and stuff like that right now, even though I think he wants to.
[00:33:54.468 --> 00:33:58.249]  But it's a good thing that he hasn't briefed him in a couple months or whatever.
[00:33:58.249 --> 00:34:00.129]  And it shows this permanent bureaucracy.
[00:34:00.129 --> 00:34:03.430]  Fauci has been in the federal government, I looked it up, 45 years.
[00:34:05.666 --> 00:34:09.848]  He's headed up those departments, three different positions, for 40.
[00:34:09.848 --> 00:34:11.808]  He is a horrible globalist.
[00:34:11.808 --> 00:34:13.309]  And Trump's just surrounded.
[00:34:13.309 --> 00:34:15.590]  You say, oh, we'll fire everybody.
[00:34:15.590 --> 00:34:18.591]  You notice the headlines, oh, the President's not allowed to fire Fauci.
[00:34:18.591 --> 00:34:22.352]  Well, the Director of Health and Human Services is.
[00:34:22.352 --> 00:34:25.533]  But first, Fauci can't be this hero up there.
[00:34:25.533 --> 00:34:32.016]  Fauci has to first be exposed and politically destroyed before he can be fired.
[00:34:32.016 --> 00:34:33.897]  Yes, absolutely.
[00:34:33.897 --> 00:34:34.897]  I wanted to make one more.
[00:34:35.818 --> 00:34:40.441]  My product plug, if I will, I've tried many of your products and I love them.
[00:34:40.441 --> 00:34:41.962]  I'm a college student.
[00:34:41.962 --> 00:34:45.545]  The APAC Power Stack is the best thing for your buck.
[00:34:45.545 --> 00:34:47.947]  I take it in the morning and I am good.
[00:34:47.947 --> 00:34:58.834]  I am so much more focused and it has helped me through school and you get a good night's sleep with the rest and recover and it doesn't make you tired in the morning.
[00:34:58.834 --> 00:35:00.575]  It just relaxes you.
[00:35:00.575 --> 00:35:04.058]  You have good dreams with the fish oil and guys, if you haven't tried,
[00:35:04.693 --> 00:35:06.154]  The 8-Pack Power Stack.
[00:35:06.154 --> 00:35:08.016]  Give yourself a chance.
[00:35:08.016 --> 00:35:10.178]  It's worked wonders for me.
[00:35:10.178 --> 00:35:12.360]  Well, 8-Pack Power Stack is our best deal.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:15.242]  It's 13 pills, half in the morning, half at night.
[00:35:15.242 --> 00:35:15.963]  That way you don't forget.
[00:35:15.963 --> 00:35:17.224]  They're in their own little packets.
[00:35:17.224 --> 00:35:18.485]  They make great gifts.
[00:35:18.485 --> 00:35:22.248]  And this is for people that aren't in the habit of taking vitamins and minerals like me or others.
[00:35:22.248 --> 00:35:24.670]  But you just remember to do it because you have two packs.
[00:35:24.670 --> 00:35:27.813]  It'll change your life because it's all super nutrients.
[00:35:27.813 --> 00:35:29.955]  I mean, we put $25 of product in a box of this.
[00:35:32.677 --> 00:35:35.978]  I can tell you they have best-selling ones that on average are $5 a product.
[00:35:35.978 --> 00:35:38.458]  And these nutrients are so great, people still do great with that.
[00:35:38.458 --> 00:35:45.460]  This is the strongest, best multivitamin, mineral, trace element packed there is out there.
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:48.500]  And it's available at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.000]  I really appreciate your call.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.401]  Thank you so much, Justin.
[00:35:51.401 --> 00:35:53.341]  All right, let's take another call here.
[00:35:53.341 --> 00:35:56.642]  Let's go to Presley in North Carolina.
[00:35:56.642 --> 00:35:57.242]  Presley, welcome.
[00:35:58.314 --> 00:35:59.755]  All right, Alex, I'm fired up.
[00:35:59.755 --> 00:36:01.055]  I'm so glad to talk to you, man.
[00:36:01.055 --> 00:36:06.318]  I wish all these patriots would get as mad about this mass crap as everybody that hates Trump.
[00:36:06.318 --> 00:36:09.679]  I wish we could funnel that same energy into our cause.
[00:36:09.679 --> 00:36:11.600]  I don't know why everybody can't.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.801]  But there's a coin shortage going on.
[00:36:13.801 --> 00:36:20.644]  I work at Walmart, and they are, like, giving people such a hard time about exact change and using cashless everything.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.303]  Oh, they've always wanted to push cashless.
[00:36:24.303 --> 00:36:25.043]  In fact, the U.N.
[00:36:25.043 --> 00:36:28.266]  a few years ago called for a coin shortage to do this.
[00:36:28.266 --> 00:36:29.587]  They're using COVID-19 to do it.
[00:36:29.587 --> 00:36:30.848]  Here it is.
[00:36:30.848 --> 00:36:32.390]  Coin shortage strikes Walmart.
[00:36:32.390 --> 00:36:35.152]  Customers required to pay with card and self-checkout.
[00:36:35.152 --> 00:36:38.475]  They're getting rid of humans at the checkouts to begin with.
[00:36:38.475 --> 00:36:39.616]  This is all evil.
[00:36:39.616 --> 00:36:41.358]  Don't let them get rid of cash.
[00:36:41.358 --> 00:36:47.964]  Once they've gotten rid of cash, the ADL can literally turn you off or you can't eat or have a job and you'll die on the side of the street.
[00:36:48.644 --> 00:36:51.225]  Okay, the ADL, Southern Poverty Law Center, they run it all.
[00:36:51.225 --> 00:36:55.948]  They run the cashless society, and they want that control to kill any underground economy.
[00:36:55.948 --> 00:36:57.669]  It's the mark of the beast.
[00:36:57.669 --> 00:37:06.934]  That's right, and I'll tell you what, I'll take that so-called noose from Bubba Wallace's garage, and I'll use that thing up and down Pennsylvania Avenue, and we'll fix everything with one noose, baby.
[00:37:06.934 --> 00:37:08.255]  God bless America!
[00:37:08.255 --> 00:37:09.075]  God bless you, brother.
[00:37:09.075 --> 00:37:09.956]  I'm glad you're pissed.
[00:37:09.956 --> 00:37:11.116]  It's out of control.
[00:37:11.116 --> 00:37:13.738]  No one should use the self-checkout lanes.
[00:37:13.738 --> 00:37:17.140]  But to make you to do it, they always will have, like, one person down there.
[00:37:18.234 --> 00:37:20.075]  Well, go stand in line for an hour.
[00:37:20.075 --> 00:37:22.477]  Don't use the self-checkouts.
[00:37:22.477 --> 00:37:23.618]  It's not an innovation.
[00:37:23.618 --> 00:37:24.859]  It is an enslavement.
[00:37:24.859 --> 00:37:28.201]  A post-human world.
[00:37:28.201 --> 00:37:30.563]  It's that simple.
[00:37:30.563 --> 00:37:33.405]  Walmart, Amazon, they're all super evil.
[00:37:33.405 --> 00:37:36.887]  But if you're gonna go to Walmart, I know in some areas it's the only place you can go.
[00:37:36.887 --> 00:37:41.090]  Sometimes I'll be out in the country, need some shotgun shells or need some, you know, oil or whatever.
[00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:44.352]  I gotta go to Walmart because the next place is 50 miles away.
[00:37:44.352 --> 00:37:45.953]  Go to the checkout lane.
[00:37:45.953 --> 00:37:46.674]  Have a human there.
[00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:53.832]  Hey Alex, thank you so much for taking my call.
[00:37:53.832 --> 00:37:54.853]  I really appreciate it.
[00:37:54.853 --> 00:37:57.374]  Can you hear me okay?
[00:37:57.374 --> 00:37:57.734]  Excellent.
[00:37:57.734 --> 00:38:00.055]  First, I just want to thank you and the whole team.
[00:38:00.055 --> 00:38:01.956]  You guys do phenomenal work.
[00:38:01.956 --> 00:38:07.058]  My family and I are so grateful for everything you're doing, and we constantly are praying for you guys.
[00:38:12.941 --> 00:38:18.115]  Just, you know, looking at these products, definitely want to get into it and especially take full advantage of the
[00:38:19.813 --> 00:38:23.895]  Christmas deals that you have going on on the site, so hopefully I'll be able to get that order in soon.
[00:38:44.124 --> 00:38:47.766]  You're a godsend, you're a leader, and I'm proud of you, and I'm grateful for your work.
[00:38:47.766 --> 00:38:53.470]  Just wanted to, just, so, so, again, we keep going back and forth with Fauci and Gates.
[00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:56.511]  How much more evidence is my question?
[00:38:56.511 --> 00:39:00.394]  We know that they did the chimeric version of this COVID-19.
[00:39:00.394 --> 00:39:11.140]  We know about the moratorium that Fauci went ahead and, you know, took taxpayer money out to Wuhan to continue their experiments creating this Frankenstein virus.
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:12.201]  We know that Fauci
[00:39:12.967 --> 00:39:13.267]  I don't
[00:39:38.254 --> 00:39:41.160]  What's going on in a whole bunch of other fronts, it's all just insane.
[00:39:41.160 --> 00:39:47.712]  But yeah, I mean it's all, see, it's like Goebbels said, if you're gonna commit a crime, commit one so big it's too evil to prosecute.
[00:39:47.712 --> 00:39:48.574]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[00:39:52.751 --> 00:40:03.080]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net surveillance censorship with AI.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:07.783]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[00:40:08.464 --> 00:40:16.828]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[00:40:16.828 --> 00:40:36.698]  And the good news is there's still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, paulwatsonsitesummit.news, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own
[00:40:37.358 --> 00:40:38.379]  Destinies.
[00:40:38.379 --> 00:40:45.328]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy.
[00:40:45.328 --> 00:40:49.833]  But being aware of it, and standing up to it, and speaking out against it, will defeat it.
[00:40:49.833 --> 00:40:51.916]  So take action, or be slaves!
[00:40:54.577 --> 00:40:57.158]  Available for shipping within three to four weeks.
[00:40:57.158 --> 00:40:57.759]  We have it.
[00:40:57.759 --> 00:41:01.260]  It's high quality, but it's got to be packaged and shipped out to you.
[00:41:01.260 --> 00:41:03.802]  Some items are shipping in a week, some in four weeks.
[00:41:03.802 --> 00:41:05.162]  So they're saying three to four weeks.
[00:41:05.162 --> 00:41:06.203]  It's my Patriot.
[00:41:06.203 --> 00:41:07.263]  We have their full catalog.
[00:41:07.263 --> 00:41:10.165]  They're in our back end at full wars store.com.
[00:41:10.165 --> 00:41:15.227]  Get your orders in now before the next big surge comes in.
[00:41:15.227 --> 00:41:20.050]  Believe me, every angle I've looked at tells me that really, really serious times are ahead.
[00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:28.320]  Whether Trump wins or loses, the globalists have already created a worldwide depression, lockdowns on a planetary scale, and it's only intensifying.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:31.523]  This is one of the big boxes you've got to get checked off.
[00:41:31.523 --> 00:41:32.985]  It's high quality, affordable food.
[00:41:32.985 --> 00:41:37.010]  MyPatriot has really good high quality food at a very affordable price.
[00:41:37.350 --> 00:41:40.235]  And the packaging is the best you're going to find out there.
[00:41:40.235 --> 00:41:43.319]  Check it out for yourself at infowarstore.com.
[00:41:43.319 --> 00:41:49.669]  And then, the money that comes in that's extra helps us fund the information warfare operation that fights the globalists toe-to-toe.
[00:41:49.669 --> 00:41:51.913]  Get your storable food now at infowarstore.com.
[00:41:53.672 --> 00:41:56.434]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup.
[00:41:56.434 --> 00:41:57.574]  My second cup of the day.
[00:41:57.574 --> 00:41:58.455]  It's really strong.
[00:41:58.455 --> 00:41:59.416]  I shouldn't do this.
[00:41:59.416 --> 00:42:02.457]  Because all work and no play makes Jack a really aggressive boy.
[00:42:02.457 --> 00:42:03.378]  And the coffee adds to it.
[00:42:03.378 --> 00:42:03.878]  But mmm.
[00:42:03.878 --> 00:42:05.559]  Wake Up America coffee everybody loves.
[00:42:05.559 --> 00:42:06.280]  Highest rated.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:07.400]  From the choppest mountains.
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:08.621]  It's beyond Mexican coffee.
[00:42:08.621 --> 00:42:09.622]  Beyond Guatemalan coffee.
[00:42:09.622 --> 00:42:10.582]  It's the best coffee in the world.
[00:42:10.582 --> 00:42:11.783]  It's right on the border between the two.
[00:42:11.783 --> 00:42:12.003]  Yes, folks.
[00:42:12.003 --> 00:42:13.184]  We've been selling it 10 years.
[00:42:13.184 --> 00:42:14.585]  Never raised the price.
[00:42:14.585 --> 00:42:15.886]  $19.95 for that big ol' bag.
[00:42:15.886 --> 00:42:16.326]  99% reviews.
[00:42:16.326 --> 00:42:16.686]  598 reviews.
[00:42:16.686 --> 00:42:17.767]  4.9 stars on third-party sites.
[00:42:17.767 --> 00:42:18.287]  Sign up for AutoShip.
[00:42:18.287 --> 00:42:18.808]  Additional 10% off.

[00:42:19.768 --> 00:42:21.990]  Don't forget to get it each month or every two months.
[00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:24.731]  You can click out to nine months whenever you want the new order coming in.
[00:42:40.962 --> 00:42:42.743]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[00:42:42.743 --> 00:42:46.465]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[00:42:46.465 --> 00:42:47.886]  It's the end of the world as we know it.
[00:42:47.886 --> 00:42:48.446]  I feel fine.
[00:43:09.762 --> 00:43:14.364]  It's the end of the world as we know it, and I don't feel fine.
[00:43:14.364 --> 00:43:25.409]  This entire takeover has been battle-planned, blueprinted, war-gamed, field-martialed by the psychological war chiefs at the United Nations and the Fortune 100.
[00:43:25.409 --> 00:43:27.490]  This is the post-human takeover.
[00:43:27.490 --> 00:43:31.172]  The noose gets tighter when you comply, not looser.
[00:43:31.972 --> 00:43:34.973]  The entire COVID-19 operation is a hoax.
[00:43:34.973 --> 00:43:40.254]  Now they admit that, quote, death numbers are dropping because those are fake, where they count people that died of something else.
[00:43:40.254 --> 00:43:42.054]  But it's all about how many cases there are.
[00:43:42.054 --> 00:43:45.875]  And now they're saying most of the population will get it.
[00:43:45.875 --> 00:43:48.396]  And then no one can go outside ever again.
[00:43:48.396 --> 00:43:50.536]  It's totally insane.
[00:43:50.536 --> 00:43:51.676]  It's a fraud.
[00:43:51.676 --> 00:43:56.137]  It's all a lie.
[00:43:56.137 --> 00:43:58.798]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:44:25.882 --> 00:44:28.883]  Chrissy Teigen married to John Legend.
[00:44:28.883 --> 00:44:34.343]  Big buddies with Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell that feminists are calling an icon now.
[00:44:34.343 --> 00:44:36.544]  Sick freaks.
[00:44:36.544 --> 00:44:39.924]  Modern feminists are a cult of killing their own babies.
[00:44:39.924 --> 00:44:45.725]  She's got a bunch of tweets salivating over little five-year-old girls.
[00:44:45.725 --> 00:44:49.446]  Because you know the media is focused on the 15-year-old girls, 14-year-old girls.
[00:44:49.446 --> 00:44:52.047]  It's far worse than that.
[00:44:52.047 --> 00:44:54.407]  Of course you know you deal with five-year-olds after you're done with them.
[00:44:56.584 --> 00:44:59.807]  You chop them up.
[00:44:59.807 --> 00:45:03.570]  As five-year-olds talk.
[00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:04.872]  Yeah, this wasn't about raping kids.
[00:45:04.872 --> 00:45:07.914]  This was about killing kids.
[00:45:07.914 --> 00:45:10.096]  And taking that energy in.
[00:45:10.096 --> 00:45:13.740]  When you do that, you get real close to the devil, because God gets real far away from you.
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:18.985]  And the devil can't get close to you unless you've totally committed homicidal murder against children.
[00:45:18.985 --> 00:45:22.408]  And once you've killed innocents, beg for their mommy while you do it.
[00:45:23.476 --> 00:45:30.799]  Then the gates of hell open up and you get a big demon.
[00:45:30.799 --> 00:45:36.521]  And these evil people commit mass atrocities to get closer to Satan.
[00:45:36.521 --> 00:45:37.581]  Hitler did the same thing.
[00:45:37.581 --> 00:45:45.925]  So we'll talk about that in a moment.
[00:45:45.925 --> 00:45:48.406]  But right now, let's finish up with Angel.
[00:45:49.875 --> 00:45:53.080]  Angel, you were bringing up accountability, Fowchee Gates, all of it.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.322]  Here's the thing.
[00:45:54.322 --> 00:45:55.503]  I have about 100 crew members.
[00:45:55.503 --> 00:45:57.086]  A little more now.
[00:45:57.086 --> 00:45:58.828]  Maybe 10 or 15 contractors on top of that.
[00:45:59.625 --> 00:46:05.367]  And if they weren't really on the program and supporting me, this place would fall apart like that.
[00:46:05.367 --> 00:46:11.309]  In fact, I have temper tantrums sometimes, and I can be a jerk, and they just understand the pressure I'm under and put up with it.
[00:46:11.309 --> 00:46:12.310]  I'm not proud of it.
[00:46:12.310 --> 00:46:20.513]  But I mean, you know, if they weren't putting up with me, and putting up with each other, and really cared about the mission, this place wouldn't run.
[00:46:20.513 --> 00:46:23.974]  Trump's got millions of people under him.
[00:46:25.020 --> 00:46:33.622]  And tens of thousands in management positions, and most of them are ladder-climbing cowards that are two-faced at the best.
[00:46:33.622 --> 00:46:40.323]  And they just want to be there in four years or in, you know, a hundred days when Trump's gone.
[00:46:40.323 --> 00:46:48.944]  And so, Joel Skousen's right, because there's few people I can get on that have, like, super deep knowledge about everything like Joel Skousen.
[00:46:48.944 --> 00:46:50.805]  Because he's been studying this 60 years.
[00:46:50.805 --> 00:46:52.225]  I've been studying it 30 years.
[00:46:53.428 --> 00:46:55.330]  And he talks about something I know what he's talking about.
[00:46:55.330 --> 00:46:57.512]  I talk about something he knows I know what I'm talking about.
[00:46:57.512 --> 00:46:59.353]  I'm not just making stuff up.
[00:46:59.353 --> 00:47:03.056]  But it's such deep knowledge where you get into the knowledge.
[00:47:03.056 --> 00:47:04.878]  So this connects to that and this connects to this.
[00:47:04.878 --> 00:47:05.799]  You learn how it works.
[00:47:05.799 --> 00:47:06.739]  You learn what's disinfo.
[00:47:06.739 --> 00:47:09.221]  You learn what's not.
[00:47:09.221 --> 00:47:11.063]  Trump is into free market.
[00:47:11.063 --> 00:47:12.024]  He likes America.
[00:47:12.024 --> 00:47:13.205]  He knows there's corrupt groups.
[00:47:13.205 --> 00:47:14.226]  He wants to fix things.
[00:47:14.226 --> 00:47:17.889]  But he has been shocked by the level of corruption.
[00:47:17.889 --> 00:47:20.131]  He thought he could go in there and say, hey, let's make America great.
[00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:24.473]  You know, everybody can still be rich, we'll bump up the stock market, you all get a bunch of money.
[00:47:24.473 --> 00:47:27.675]  Military, you can do what you want, you know, as long as it's constitutional.
[00:47:27.675 --> 00:47:30.678]  I'm not gonna be on your ass, we're not gonna put you in jail for BS.
[00:47:30.678 --> 00:47:39.165]  He thought everybody would get with the program, and Trump is, like, shocked, like, there's this many people that go out of their way to destroy the country?
[00:47:39.165 --> 00:47:42.788]  And so now, three and a half plus years in, Trump's educated now.
[00:47:43.817 --> 00:47:46.619]  They're really worried because he's gone on the offense.
[00:47:46.619 --> 00:47:48.541]  That's the headline today for the show.
[00:47:48.541 --> 00:47:50.563]  Trump goes on offense.
[00:47:50.563 --> 00:47:52.945]  Trump awakens, goes on offense.
[00:47:52.945 --> 00:47:57.869]  And he is going on offense, you're now seeing.
[00:47:57.869 --> 00:48:09.339]  But, if I had a will and I'd climbed Mount Everest before, but I didn't have equipment, and that means people that work with him, people that do what he says, people that have courage, he doesn't have
[00:48:12.182 --> 00:48:19.485]  The spikes, or the boots, or the ice hook, or the hammer, or gloves.
[00:48:19.485 --> 00:48:23.646]  And so he's trying to climb Mount Everest in his underwear.
[00:48:23.646 --> 00:48:26.207]  But you know, that's just the way that it goes.
[00:48:26.207 --> 00:48:29.608]  I mean, basically, we won the Revolutionary War without shoes.
[00:48:29.608 --> 00:48:31.209]  We'll win this fight.
[00:48:31.209 --> 00:48:34.890]  It's just shameful how much scum there is at upper management level.
[00:48:35.897 --> 00:48:38.300]  I'll tell you this, because I know him from experience.
[00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:43.607]  The federal government at the mid-level and the actual, where people are working, are good people on average.
[00:48:43.607 --> 00:48:47.071]  But it's those top ones the globalists have put in, like Fauci.
[00:48:47.071 --> 00:48:47.892]  So Trump gets in...
[00:48:49.659 --> 00:48:56.101]  And you see China locked down and all this craziness, and Democrats are like, oh, don't lock down, and Trump goes, oh, wait a minute, there's a setup here.
[00:48:56.101 --> 00:48:59.122]  So it is a limited lockdown, so they couldn't say he didn't respond.
[00:48:59.122 --> 00:49:00.762]  He understood that.
[00:49:00.762 --> 00:49:05.803]  But then now it's obvious they want to keep it locked down to hurt the economy, hurt the American people, and they're lying about the numbers.
[00:49:05.803 --> 00:49:09.184]  Trump is doing all he can do is bypass the UN.
[00:49:09.184 --> 00:49:13.826]  Then he finds out, well, the CDC is still under the command of the UN.
[00:49:13.826 --> 00:49:14.886]  So now he bypasses the CDC.
[00:49:17.113 --> 00:49:26.636]  He's doing some big moves, but here's Trump's Achilles heel, and you know, it's not his Achilles heel.
[00:49:26.636 --> 00:49:32.798]  The stock market is a fraud, it's overinflated, it's all fiat, so is the Chinese stock market, so is the EU.
[00:49:32.798 --> 00:49:35.919]  Now it's a game of what fiat system ends up on top.
[00:49:35.919 --> 00:49:38.400]  Fiscal conservatism, all that's out the window now.
[00:49:39.568 --> 00:49:43.550]  The question is, who's going to be in charge of the coming fiasco?
[00:49:43.550 --> 00:49:54.056]  We don't want the UN and the CHICOMS in charge of it, and dictating to us that we're in debt to them, like the Versailles Treaty and the Germans at World War I. We really don't want to go that way.
[00:49:54.056 --> 00:50:01.460]  So I see Trump given a horrible situation, saying let's beat them then at their own game.
[00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:07.023]  But realizing one big bailout's okay, two's too much, they want to keep it locked down so the second bailout's needed.
[00:50:08.168 --> 00:50:15.890]  Because the plan is to make the dollar unsolvent and tank us completely, which has been Soros' hard-on from the beginning.
[00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:27.093]  I mean, I was in the 80s watching Lair News Hour, McNeil-Lair News Hour, and it was like, George Soros, master criminal, who crashed the pound and crashed this, trying to crash the dollar, 1989, you know.
[00:50:27.093 --> 00:50:27.693]  He failed.
[00:50:27.693 --> 00:50:28.753]  He should be arrested.
[00:50:28.753 --> 00:50:35.315]  That was before he just spent billions buying the media off, and now he's the nicest guy since, you know, sliced bread, since key lime pie.
[00:50:39.051 --> 00:50:43.053]  So that's what's going on here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:50:43.053 --> 00:50:46.054]  And it's a fiasco.
[00:50:46.054 --> 00:50:49.076]  The whole thing's a crisis, and it's crazy.
[00:50:49.076 --> 00:50:57.759]  But if Trump arrests Fauci or does that, it'll look like, oh, he's arresting people as if the Justice Department won't even follow his orders, you know, just because he's mad at him.
[00:50:57.759 --> 00:50:59.840]  He has to discredit him first.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:01.061]  So that's what's happening.
[00:51:01.061 --> 00:51:02.962]  America's fighting for its life.
[00:51:02.962 --> 00:51:04.583]  Angel, I guess, just hung up.
[00:51:04.583 --> 00:51:07.484]  I was about to go back to Angel, but I understand Angel, he had to go.
[00:51:08.629 --> 00:51:09.130]  Here's what I'll do.
[00:51:09.130 --> 00:51:13.314]  I'll come back in the next short segment, take a few calls, then I'll hit the whole pedophile scandal that just broke.
[00:51:13.314 --> 00:51:15.236]  The big one, the confirmed one, the admitted one.
[00:51:15.236 --> 00:51:17.658]  You know, Wayfair, you could ask, is that real?
[00:51:17.658 --> 00:51:18.259]  What is that?
[00:51:18.259 --> 00:51:19.240]  This is real.
[00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:21.161]  This is big.
[00:51:21.161 --> 00:51:25.786]  It's a window into something really important that we're going to be exposing.
[00:51:25.786 --> 00:51:28.609]  So we'll continue on with your phone calls separately.
[00:51:30.913 --> 00:51:34.036]  We have a new t-shirt, two different t-shirts.
[00:51:34.036 --> 00:51:36.558]  They came out earlier this week, USA Today, CNN.
[00:51:36.558 --> 00:51:41.802]  They said, Trump campaign has a Nazi eagle for its symbol.
[00:51:41.802 --> 00:51:48.027]  And it was an American eagle spreading its wings like the Marine Corps standing on a globe that was the American flag.
[00:51:48.027 --> 00:51:51.230]  The triggering thing was the globe was the American flag.
[00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:53.211]  And so I said, why don't we make one even better?
[00:51:53.211 --> 00:51:57.174]  So we've got two different eagle t-shirts at Infowarestore.com.
[00:51:59.514 --> 00:52:01.256]  One with a ring of 20 stars.
[00:52:01.256 --> 00:52:02.957]  One that does it.
[00:52:02.957 --> 00:52:05.119]  It's got the Betsy Ross flag on the eagle's chest.
[00:52:05.119 --> 00:52:08.222]  There's another one where the Betsy Ross flag is what the eagle's standing on.
[00:52:08.222 --> 00:52:10.104]  On the back it says InfoWars.com.
[00:52:10.104 --> 00:52:11.826]  Let's show them the back.
[00:52:11.826 --> 00:52:13.667]  On the back it's got InfoWars.com.
[00:52:13.667 --> 00:52:14.588]  Keep America Great.
[00:52:14.588 --> 00:52:17.111]  This is a triggering shirt.
[00:52:18.208 --> 00:52:19.729]  It's a high-quality shirt.
[00:52:19.729 --> 00:52:22.110]  It's got printing on the front, the back, and the arm.
[00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:24.311]  The shirts are costing us like $10 apiece.
[00:52:24.311 --> 00:52:26.072]  You get it for $19.95.
[00:52:26.072 --> 00:52:26.892]  No reviews yet.
[00:52:26.892 --> 00:52:29.814]  They're being printed right now in Austin, Texas.
[00:52:29.814 --> 00:52:31.535]  And they'll be shipping out to you next week.
[00:52:31.535 --> 00:52:33.636]  Get your orders in now.
[00:52:33.636 --> 00:52:40.799]  I was thinking, what's the iconic ad or the iconic t-shirt to promote freedom out there in the public?
[00:52:40.799 --> 00:52:42.600]  Because we're all a walking billboard.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:46.062]  And I was already, two weeks ago, doing American Eagle designs.
[00:52:47.148 --> 00:52:50.571]  And then I saw that and I said, this is what we're going to go with, even better than the Trump one.
[00:52:50.571 --> 00:52:52.774]  I mean, quite frankly, it is better.
[00:52:52.774 --> 00:52:57.238]  And they're calling the American eagle, the bald eagle, Nazi.
[00:52:57.238 --> 00:52:59.761]  They're calling the American flag Nazi.
[00:52:59.761 --> 00:53:05.587]  It's in the news, they're trying to cancel the Star-Spangled Banner at NFL games.
[00:53:05.587 --> 00:53:07.909]  They're announcing the first few games, they're not going to have it.
[00:53:07.909 --> 00:53:09.370]  They're going to have some communist anthem.
[00:53:09.370 --> 00:53:10.471]  But they can't stop you.
[00:53:12.076 --> 00:53:37.404]  from wearing this shirt and it is a bold beautiful original American Eagle that is like just absolutely all got its feathers all fluffed up and it's pissed off and it's got olive branch in one hand and a bunch of arrows in the other so we're here for peace but if you want war baby you are going to get what you came looking for so I hope this shirt gets seen all over the country I hope the RNC and DNC that are going to be
[00:53:38.271 --> 00:53:40.071]  Really weird events, but we're going to be there.
[00:53:40.071 --> 00:53:43.192]  I hope that these shirts are dominant.
[00:53:43.192 --> 00:53:44.392]  Get them today.
[00:53:44.392 --> 00:53:46.033]  InfowarStore.com.

[00:53:51.854 --> 00:53:53.774]  And yeah, we were unable to launch the new products this week.
[00:54:04.431 --> 00:54:05.252]  I said there's eight of them.
[00:54:05.252 --> 00:54:06.674]  There's actually ten of them.
[00:54:06.674 --> 00:54:09.678]  You count the toothpaste and the mouthwash and there's eight others.
[00:54:09.678 --> 00:54:10.420]  It's ten.
[00:54:10.420 --> 00:54:17.389]  It's ten products that came in that are new, a year in development, and then there's one certificate we gotta get before we do it.
[00:54:17.389 --> 00:54:18.892]  So, I just said fine.
[00:54:21.223 --> 00:54:22.483]  Christmas comes in July.
[00:54:22.483 --> 00:54:24.124]  Storewide free shipping, double Patreon points.
[00:54:24.124 --> 00:54:29.085]  50-60% off storewide, including Brain Force and stuff that's been sold out at InfoWareStore.com.
[00:54:29.085 --> 00:54:29.645]  That's how you fund us.
[00:54:29.645 --> 00:54:35.847]  I want to thank you all for your support, but please support those local radio stations and tell them you appreciate them, become a sponsor, and spread the word.
[00:54:35.847 --> 00:54:38.808]  We'll be back with your phone calls and a lot more in the second hour.
[00:54:38.808 --> 00:54:39.148]  Stay with us.
[00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:44.311]  It's Christmas in July.
[00:54:44.311 --> 00:54:45.551]  We ran the sale last year.
[00:54:45.551 --> 00:54:47.312]  It was very, very popular.
[00:54:47.312 --> 00:54:53.596]  And so I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election year.
[00:54:53.596 --> 00:54:59.138]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[00:54:59.138 --> 00:55:04.741]  It's the American Eagle, boldly spreading its wings, sitting atop a Betsy Ross flag.
[00:55:04.741 --> 00:55:07.423]  And the shirts are on sale right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:55:08.543 --> 00:55:14.649]  I got the idea from the Trump campaign of having a similar shirt to the media called Nazi, which of course it isn't.
[00:55:14.649 --> 00:55:19.313]  And since it's so triggering to the leftists and globalists, well, we're gonna make sure there's even more of these on the streets.
[00:55:20.043 --> 00:55:20.363]  I think so.
[00:55:44.065 --> 00:55:51.168]  So I was taking care of an errand this morning, and I wasn't even close to downtown, but I was parked on a little side street going to this business.
[00:55:51.168 --> 00:56:00.132]  When I came back out, I saw what looked like two Asian folks, probably Chinese, walking down the sidewalk about 50 yards up ahead of me.
[00:56:00.132 --> 00:56:04.894]  And here I am parked a truck with the windows up, and the woman stops and points at me.
[00:56:04.894 --> 00:56:08.175]  So they stop, and they wait while I'm inside my truck.
[00:56:08.175 --> 00:56:09.136]  Truck started.
[00:56:09.136 --> 00:56:10.576]  And they sit there and stretch.
[00:56:10.576 --> 00:56:11.217]  She keeps pointing.
[00:56:11.877 --> 00:56:13.891]  And they put their hands out like they're waiting for me.
[00:56:15.202 --> 00:56:19.645]  To go, because I'm not wearing a mask inside my car.
[00:56:19.645 --> 00:56:23.609]  And so then I just sat there, so they acted angry and walked past me.
[00:56:23.609 --> 00:56:28.953]  I almost shot a video of it on my phone, but everybody sees this stuff happening everywhere.
[00:56:28.953 --> 00:56:29.913]  This is mental illness.
[00:56:29.913 --> 00:56:33.496]  People are pulling guns on folks that aren't wearing masks.
[00:56:33.496 --> 00:56:34.937]  This is all cult programming.
[00:56:34.937 --> 00:56:36.499]  This is all about submitting.
[00:56:36.499 --> 00:56:39.341]  We cannot submit to this UN brainwashing.
[00:56:39.341 --> 00:56:40.742]  It's all a giant fraud.
[00:56:40.742 --> 00:56:43.044]  We must expose the fraud or become slaves to it.
[00:56:47.105 --> 00:57:07.092]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[00:57:07.092 --> 00:57:10.213]  It's a clown world!
[00:57:10.213 --> 00:57:10.773]  We're just living it.
[00:57:10.773 --> 00:57:12.814]  Let's go back to your phone calls.
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:15.300]  Hey Alex, good to speak to you.
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:16.881]  Have you ever heard of Kent Hovind?
[00:57:16.881 --> 00:57:22.064]  I was just trying to recommend him as a guest once in a while.
[00:57:22.064 --> 00:57:24.385]  My question is, what else can you take
[00:57:49.211 --> 00:57:51.493]  Well, that's a good question.
[00:57:51.493 --> 00:57:52.894]  I should ask some of the experts.
[00:57:52.894 --> 00:58:03.202]  I mean, I know that the bad halogens, fluoride, bromide, bromine, chloride, that all gets into the pineal and calcifies it.
[00:58:03.202 --> 00:58:05.744]  That's a fact.
[00:58:05.744 --> 00:58:08.606]  But I don't know what else is known to be able to decalcify that.
[00:58:08.606 --> 00:58:11.108]  I know that pure iodine is able to do it.
[00:58:11.108 --> 00:58:11.569]  What do you think?
[00:58:13.376 --> 00:58:26.180]  Yeah, no, I started a few months ago, and yeah, like you said, it took a couple weeks to kind of run you down, but then the boost of energy, your lifestyle becomes better with it.
[00:58:26.180 --> 00:58:28.041]  I'm truly grateful for that.
[00:58:28.041 --> 00:58:31.342]  I put my kids on it, my wife's on it, we all love it.
[00:58:31.342 --> 00:58:36.183]  What do you think, God bless you brother, what do you think Trump should do?
[00:58:36.183 --> 00:58:38.444]  He's definitely got to go in the offense.
[00:58:38.444 --> 00:58:40.584]  Like you said, he's just got to be straight with us.
[00:58:40.584 --> 00:58:42.385]  Tell us what's really going on.
[00:58:43.010 --> 00:58:45.471]  Give as much information to us as he can.
[00:58:45.471 --> 00:58:49.514]  Like, he has to be honest with the public and we will respond.
[00:58:49.514 --> 00:58:55.157]  The Patriots will respond in a positive way.
[00:58:55.157 --> 00:58:57.778]  He just has to go after Fauci and the vaccine and Bill Gates.
[00:58:57.778 --> 00:59:01.420]  He's just scared it'll crash the stock market.
[00:59:01.420 --> 00:59:02.221]  He can't worry.
[00:59:02.221 --> 00:59:04.762]  I mean, the bubble is already deflating.
[00:59:04.762 --> 00:59:06.463]  Like, it's eventual.
[00:59:06.463 --> 00:59:08.324]  It will happen eventually.
[00:59:08.324 --> 00:59:10.245]  He just has to be real with us.
[00:59:13.715 --> 00:59:23.257]  Getting back briefly to the iodine, what was it, I mean, how many weeks till you felt toxic taking it and then how long till you didn't feel toxic and then hit the other side?
[00:59:23.257 --> 00:59:26.098]  Because that's what everybody reports.
[00:59:26.098 --> 00:59:33.780]  Yeah, it started about two weeks after I started taking it and then, I mean, my wife even asked me, she's like, what's wrong with you?
[00:59:33.780 --> 00:59:35.580]  You just seem so distant.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:41.842]  And yeah, for maybe two, three weeks process after the other side, like it was just, I'm a different person.
[00:59:42.608 --> 00:59:43.850]  Like I've always been outgoing.
[00:59:43.850 --> 00:59:50.038]  Well that's what happens is, and I don't want to get technical, because I'm not a doctor, but this is what I believe and what I've seen.
[00:59:50.038 --> 00:59:52.981]  You've got all that fluoride and things in there clouding up the pineal gland.
[00:59:53.936 --> 00:59:56.117]  Which they admit is like the seed of the soul.
[00:59:56.117 --> 01:00:01.579]  And then when it starts breaking up and flaking out and moving out, it gets kind of worse for a while because it's breaking up.
[01:00:01.579 --> 01:00:05.860]  But then after that clears out, then it's like, one morning you wake up and it's like, wow!
[01:00:05.860 --> 01:00:08.021]  And the dreams you have and just everything.
[01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:10.122]  And again, iodine's essential.
[01:00:10.122 --> 01:00:13.763]  And no one knows that it's almost completely out of the soil.
[01:00:13.763 --> 01:00:14.644]  It's not in the food.
[01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:22.327]  The UN admits that almost 3 billion people have mental disabilities on the planet, have lower IQs because of lack of iodine.
[01:00:22.327 --> 01:00:23.067]  Is that not insane?
[01:00:24.634 --> 01:00:25.754]  It is insane.
[01:00:25.754 --> 01:00:30.696]  My five-year-old was asked just two days ago at her martial arts class.
[01:00:30.696 --> 01:00:33.257]  Other kids were like, hey, do you have this game on your tablet?
[01:00:33.257 --> 01:00:35.178]  She's like, why do I need a tablet?
[01:00:35.178 --> 01:00:35.838]  She's a five-year-old.
[01:00:35.838 --> 01:00:37.419]  She said, why do I need a tablet?
[01:00:37.419 --> 01:00:38.639]  And they were like, what do you mean?
[01:00:38.639 --> 01:00:39.480]  What do you do for fun?
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.340]  She's like, I'm a kid.
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.621]  I go outside and play.
[01:00:42.621 --> 01:00:44.141]  I play with my toys.
[01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:46.202]  Like, I use my imagination.
[01:00:46.202 --> 01:00:48.883]  The other children grouped around her.
[01:00:48.883 --> 01:00:51.724]  Like, she, you could see a leadership fall.
[01:00:51.724 --> 01:00:53.645]  They were just blown away.
[01:00:54.181 --> 01:00:56.143]  That she was like, I do not want tablets.
[01:00:56.143 --> 01:01:03.108]  And I give it credit through no fluoride in her system, all five years, no vaccines.
[01:01:03.108 --> 01:01:06.150]  She's smarter than anyone, like any child I've known.
[01:01:06.150 --> 01:01:09.092]  And I've raised five kids that aren't my own.
[01:01:09.092 --> 01:01:10.553]  She's completely different.
[01:01:10.553 --> 01:01:12.274]  And I give it credit, no vaccines.
[01:01:12.274 --> 01:01:16.398]  I give it credit in this last few months to the X2 and X3.
[01:01:16.398 --> 01:01:23.503]  It's just completely different when you don't give kids fluoride compared to say her
[01:01:29.289 --> 01:01:29.929]  Well, that's it.
[01:01:29.929 --> 01:01:31.931]  I mean, Iodine is the opposite of fluoride.
[01:01:31.931 --> 01:01:34.053]  The globalists want you to have fluoride.
[01:01:34.053 --> 01:01:35.214]  They don't want you to have Iodine.
[01:01:35.214 --> 01:01:35.995]  Wonder why.
[01:01:35.995 --> 01:01:36.936]  Amazing testimony.
[01:01:36.936 --> 01:01:38.317]  God bless you, Scott.
[01:01:38.317 --> 01:01:40.319]  And I know you thank God for those great children you've got.
[01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:40.919]  We pray for them.
[01:01:40.919 --> 01:01:43.742]  We'll be right back with more calls, and I'll hit the big pedophile ring story.
[01:01:51.502 --> 01:01:54.503]  I know what we'll do to make them conform to our cult.
[01:01:54.503 --> 01:02:03.047]  We'll all tell them to wear masks or they're gonna die, and then we'll release the pressure for a while, then bring it back and squeeze it harder, and release it again, and we'll be the virtuous ignorers.
[01:02:03.047 --> 01:02:08.530]  We'll be the angels, even though our lord and master Bill Gates helped fund the whole COVID-19, oh.
[01:02:08.530 --> 01:02:08.750]  No!
[01:02:08.750 --> 01:02:12.232]  Don't sadookie me!
[01:02:13.072 --> 01:02:23.661]  That's right, that's the code word for Bill Gates' operation he carries out with his good little buddy Dr. Fauci in the surgeon cult.
[01:02:23.661 --> 01:02:28.705]  As you know for girls there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance novels.
[01:02:28.705 --> 01:02:31.968]  One of them is the vampire, the werewolf, the
[01:02:32.068 --> 01:02:34.671]  Psychopaths are so hot.
[01:03:02.108 --> 01:03:03.348]  You found it.
[01:03:03.348 --> 01:03:05.369]  The tip of the spear.
[01:03:05.369 --> 01:03:08.809]  It is the Alex Jones Show!
[01:03:08.809 --> 01:03:24.412]  Alright, we're going to continue with your phone calls in a moment.
[01:03:24.412 --> 01:03:25.493]  I am Alex Jones, your host.
[01:03:25.493 --> 01:03:26.913]  But let's look at Chrissy Teigen.
[01:03:29.119 --> 01:03:33.900]  And her creepy boyfriend and all the weird stuff that she's involved in.
[01:03:33.900 --> 01:03:40.502]  People started looking through her Twitter because she would fly around with Jeffrey Epstein on his plane and Ghislaine Maxwell.
[01:03:40.502 --> 01:03:45.824]  And they found the quotes where she talked about, I'd like to eat people at restaurants.
[01:03:45.824 --> 01:03:50.485]  I'd get off sexually on little girls spreading their legs.
[01:03:50.485 --> 01:03:52.246]  You know, sex with kids is no big deal.
[01:03:52.246 --> 01:03:55.647]  You can go read these tweets for yourself.
[01:03:58.390 --> 01:04:06.776]  Chrissy Teigen blocks 1 million Twitter accounts driving conspiracy theories that links her to Jeffrey Epstein, Fox News.
[01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:26.131]  But it goes on to admit she's friends with him, flew on the pedophile airplane, and then she made all of these disgusting comments on Twitter that she's now been deleting that she doesn't want people to see.
[01:04:28.413 --> 01:04:29.594]  Meanwhile, shock!
[01:04:29.594 --> 01:04:44.965]  Amazon sells sports bag with a photo of a child with tape over their mouth inside the bag.
[01:04:44.965 --> 01:04:47.587]  We'll put the color version of that up in a moment.
[01:04:47.587 --> 01:04:50.789]  But let's put up some of her tweets for folks.
[01:04:50.789 --> 01:04:55.312]  Some of the ones that aren't too pornographic.
[01:04:55.312 --> 01:04:56.173]  Seeing little girls
[01:04:57.449 --> 01:04:58.749]  Do the splits.
[01:04:58.749 --> 01:05:05.071]  Half-naked is just... I want to put myself in jail.
[01:05:05.071 --> 01:05:08.473]  Hashtag toddlers and tiaras.
[01:05:08.473 --> 01:05:11.093]  Remember?
[01:05:11.093 --> 01:05:18.896]  Salon and Vice and HBO with men watching half-naked four-year-olds dance saying they're getting erections.
[01:05:18.896 --> 01:05:23.037]  This is them throwing in your face what they're into.
[01:05:23.037 --> 01:05:25.038]  I'm about to Anthony Weiner this kid.
[01:05:26.069 --> 01:05:29.011]  Talking about a child she wants to have sex with.
[01:05:29.011 --> 01:05:31.613]  I just saw a baby that looked like a porn star.
[01:05:31.613 --> 01:05:34.455]  Like a trashy, do-anything porn star.
[01:05:34.455 --> 01:05:38.097]  Is this wrong to think?
[01:05:38.097 --> 01:05:44.321]  This is Hollywood, folks.
[01:05:44.321 --> 01:05:49.504]  And then, making fun of Christ, being killed.
[01:05:49.504 --> 01:05:51.546]  She's just a standard, empty,
[01:05:53.021 --> 01:05:57.383]  Devil whisperer that only feels alive if she's doing something evil.
[01:05:57.383 --> 01:06:01.105]  She's deleted 60,000 tweets because she's worried for her family.
[01:06:01.105 --> 01:06:02.466]  That's right.
[01:06:02.466 --> 01:06:04.807]  Oh, people are being mean to her.
[01:06:04.807 --> 01:06:10.930]  I'm a million percent going to be a child from Toddlers and Tiaras for Halloween.
[01:06:10.930 --> 01:06:13.251]  Can we fast forward time, please?
[01:06:13.251 --> 01:06:16.973]  I am beyond excited.
[01:06:16.973 --> 01:06:18.733]  And what does James Gunn do for Hollywood?
[01:06:18.733 --> 01:06:19.314]  He puts on
[01:06:20.595 --> 01:06:26.259]  Child molestation parties where people dress up like children, women, and then have sex with men.
[01:06:26.259 --> 01:06:38.529]  And if you buy the Cowboys bag from Nike, it has the image of a child taped up inside.
[01:06:38.529 --> 01:06:41.431]  Writer-director James Gunn fired from Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.
[01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:44.994]  3 over offensive tweets.
[01:06:44.994 --> 01:06:46.935]  It was, oh, it's just comedy.
[01:06:46.935 --> 01:06:49.057]  But it wasn't really
[01:06:50.953 --> 01:06:52.614]  Just comedy, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:52.614 --> 01:06:55.076]  It's what they're into.
[01:06:55.076 --> 01:06:57.138]  It's what they do.
[01:06:57.138 --> 01:06:58.259]  It's the club.
[01:06:58.259 --> 01:07:03.984]  Here is Chrissy, we were just talking about, talking about cannibalism.
[01:07:03.984 --> 01:07:05.625]  Because at the end of the day, that's all this is.
[01:07:05.625 --> 01:07:07.526]  And if you'll hurt children, you'll hurt anybody.
[01:07:07.526 --> 01:07:08.867]  That's what this cannibalism is.
[01:07:08.867 --> 01:07:09.148]  Here it is.
[01:07:10.282 --> 01:07:13.763]  If a person okayed it, I would eat a human.
[01:07:13.763 --> 01:07:19.124]  If you were at a very fancy restaurant and they were like a tiny piece of human meat.
[01:07:19.124 --> 01:07:19.724]  No, no, no.
[01:07:19.724 --> 01:07:23.085]  I think the only way... You wouldn't try a tiny bite?
[01:07:23.085 --> 01:07:23.445]  No.
[01:07:23.445 --> 01:07:23.885]  Really?
[01:07:23.885 --> 01:07:25.166]  Absolutely not.
[01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:27.966]  You're so terrible.
[01:07:27.966 --> 01:07:30.747]  American Trump.
[01:07:30.747 --> 01:07:33.108]  Now, you know, old Jones, you said you'd eat your neighbors.
[01:07:33.108 --> 01:07:37.269]  I'm in a society collapsed, like Jonathan Swift, that that's where we're headed.
[01:07:37.269 --> 01:07:38.109]  I don't want that to happen.
[01:07:38.109 --> 01:07:39.049]  No, I wouldn't eat my neighbors.
[01:07:41.101 --> 01:07:42.462]  But look at this.
[01:07:42.462 --> 01:07:43.343]  This ties into her.
[01:07:43.343 --> 01:07:45.044]  It's all about abusive children.
[01:07:45.044 --> 01:07:46.665]  Medical experiments on children.
[01:07:46.665 --> 01:07:48.946]  Medical experiments on young people.
[01:07:48.946 --> 01:07:50.587]  That's what the whole trans movement is.
[01:07:50.587 --> 01:07:51.188]  Lawsuit!
[01:07:51.188 --> 01:07:58.393]  Teen boy forced to take estrogen shots after diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder.
[01:07:58.393 --> 01:08:05.037]  You know, you've heard they've said, oh, let's give estrogen to child molesters, hoping that won't make them want to rape children, but it doesn't work.
[01:08:05.037 --> 01:08:08.880]  But now, if you're in juvenile hall and you don't behave yourself,
[01:08:09.824 --> 01:08:11.405]  You're not there for rape or any of that.
[01:08:11.405 --> 01:08:12.345]  You're just defiant.
[01:08:12.345 --> 01:08:17.628]  We're going to give you estrogen shots that they say will make you behave yourself.
[01:08:17.628 --> 01:08:18.969]  The story's on InfoWars.com.
[01:08:18.969 --> 01:08:19.969]  It's a Kit Daniels article.
[01:08:19.969 --> 01:08:23.931]  It needs to go absolutely viral.
[01:08:23.931 --> 01:08:25.552]  Well, they just found another thing of her.
[01:08:25.552 --> 01:08:32.596]  Talking about having sex with 13-year-olds.
[01:08:32.596 --> 01:08:33.236]  God almighty.
[01:08:34.844 --> 01:08:41.949]  I mean, Tony Podesta was in full-page articles praising child porn in 2007 in the Washington Post.
[01:08:41.949 --> 01:08:48.815]  They are externalizing their sickness.
[01:08:48.815 --> 01:08:48.995]  Wow.
[01:08:51.223 --> 01:08:52.704]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see this.
[01:08:52.704 --> 01:08:54.265]  I'm not even going to read this on air.
[01:08:54.265 --> 01:08:54.805]  Lawsuit.
[01:08:54.805 --> 01:08:59.288]  Teen boy forced to take estrogen shots and were diagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder.
[01:08:59.288 --> 01:09:09.455]  16-year-old boy was forced to take estrogen shots at a Los Angeles juvenile hall after he was diagnosed with operational oppositional defiant disorder.
[01:09:09.455 --> 01:09:19.302]  The teenager, who didn't respect authority, was given estradiol, a form of female hormone, estrogen, as treatment by a doctor, resulting in him developing
[01:09:20.714 --> 01:09:29.040]  Bitch tits, a condition that causes males to grow enlarged breasts due to higher than normal level of estrogen according to the suit.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:36.165]  Plaintiff further alleges that the experimental treatment has been or is being given to male youths within the county of Los Angeles.
[01:09:36.165 --> 01:09:37.425]  Really think so?
[01:09:37.425 --> 01:09:39.747]  Juvenile courts, what it is is sterilization.
[01:09:39.747 --> 01:09:43.770]  If you get this long enough, you're sterilized.
[01:09:43.770 --> 01:09:49.634]  Juvenile courts, juvenile halls, and juvenile detention facilities without first obtaining their voluntary and informed consent.
[01:09:51.414 --> 01:09:52.855]  Yeah, it's medical experiments.
[01:09:52.855 --> 01:09:55.576]  It started 50 years ago in England with prisoners.
[01:09:55.576 --> 01:09:56.376]  Now it's children.
[01:09:56.376 --> 01:09:57.456]  Now it's retarded children.
[01:09:57.456 --> 01:09:59.297]  Now it's autistic children.
[01:09:59.297 --> 01:10:02.238]  Now it's prisoners.
[01:10:02.238 --> 01:10:04.359]  We had a call today that had problems.
[01:10:04.359 --> 01:10:10.421]  We didn't make it on air.
[01:10:10.421 --> 01:10:12.042]  Yeah, Adult Swim makes fun of this.
[01:10:12.042 --> 01:10:12.922]  It's all so sick.
[01:10:12.922 --> 01:10:13.802]  Kids in cages.
[01:10:13.802 --> 01:10:15.303]  What Alfred Kinsey did.
[01:10:15.303 --> 01:10:17.624]  They're so proud of themselves.
[01:10:21.064 --> 01:10:24.447]  And they're externalizing their entire hierarchy to us.
[01:10:24.447 --> 01:10:32.652]  It's all about killing children, all about locking them up in cages, all about raping them, all about fetishizing them, because they need an army of people that have no soul.
[01:10:32.652 --> 01:10:34.934]  And they're all weird.
[01:10:34.934 --> 01:10:36.275]  Chicken-necked.
[01:10:36.275 --> 01:10:39.137]  Weak leftists.
[01:10:39.137 --> 01:10:40.318]  No one stops them.
[01:10:40.318 --> 01:10:41.599]  No one stands up to them.
[01:10:41.599 --> 01:10:45.362]  No one resists them.
[01:10:45.362 --> 01:10:46.823]  And so they believe they have total power.
[01:10:47.711 --> 01:10:48.431]  And I apologize.
[01:10:48.431 --> 01:10:52.394]  The first caller today, he said he was in a jail where they're already testing COVID on him.
[01:10:52.394 --> 01:10:53.995]  I know that goes on for a fact.
[01:10:53.995 --> 01:10:55.816]  And then he had an audio problem, so I hung up on him.
[01:10:55.816 --> 01:10:56.416]  I apologize.
[01:10:56.416 --> 01:10:56.937]  I didn't know that.
[01:10:56.937 --> 01:10:58.017]  I would have stayed with you.
[01:10:58.017 --> 01:10:59.178]  I'm just sick of calls calling in.
[01:10:59.178 --> 01:11:03.000]  They're listening to the radio, and then they don't get on.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:08.144]  But, uh, I mean, they already covered up a bunch of bad effects of the vaccine.
[01:11:08.144 --> 01:11:11.886]  They already covered up some of the poster people that were out promoting it as a great thing.
[01:11:11.886 --> 01:11:13.767]  They got really sick, and then it got covered up.
[01:11:13.767 --> 01:11:14.508]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[01:11:14.508 --> 01:11:15.608]  has been exposing that.
[01:11:15.608 --> 01:11:16.529]  This is crazy.
[01:11:18.646 --> 01:11:26.691]  The teenager's parents brought the lawsuit because they say they were never informed about the estrogen shots or his oppositional defiant disorder.
[01:11:26.691 --> 01:11:27.512]  Totally illegal, folks.
[01:11:27.512 --> 01:11:30.393]  That's secret experimentation.
[01:11:30.393 --> 01:11:32.575]  I mean, they're chopping millions of little boys' balls off.
[01:11:32.575 --> 01:11:33.475]  Of course they'll do this.
[01:11:33.475 --> 01:11:42.081]  I mean, there is no, any kind of indication that provided estradiol to an adolescent male is any kind of acceptable treatment for anything.
[01:11:42.081 --> 01:11:45.083]  The boy's lawyer, Wes Ochie, told
[01:11:46.226 --> 01:11:47.507]  Witness L.A.
[01:11:47.507 --> 01:11:53.029]  We think it's an experiment and we think it's likely to be only time they use the treatment experimentally.
[01:11:53.029 --> 01:11:54.890]  Oh no.
[01:11:54.890 --> 01:11:58.171]  It's going on widespread like shooting blacks up with syphilis.
[01:11:58.171 --> 01:11:59.632]  Democratic Party.
[01:11:59.632 --> 01:12:06.675]  To make his point, the lawyer said he was curious that the staff would have estradiol readily available for treatment.
[01:12:06.675 --> 01:12:12.197]  Another key point is the staff believed the teenager had slightly elevated testosterone levels according to the complaint.
[01:12:12.197 --> 01:12:12.897]  Oh!
[01:12:12.897 --> 01:12:13.497]  All the males need
[01:12:15.489 --> 01:12:17.230]  Your estrogen.
[01:12:17.230 --> 01:12:18.250]  And what does fluoride do?
[01:12:18.250 --> 01:12:20.671]  Lower your testosterone as well.
[01:12:20.671 --> 01:12:22.811]  It's all about gelding you.
[01:12:22.811 --> 01:12:31.694]  It's a global scientific project to make it fancy and cool to roll out secret experimentation on children.
[01:12:31.694 --> 01:12:39.736]  All right, we've got loaded phone calls from Ruben, Russell, Walt, Kenny, Andre, Matthew, Craig, Charles, Shaggy, Matt, Alex.
[01:12:39.736 --> 01:12:42.757]  The longer you've been holding, the faster I go to you on the other side.
[01:12:42.757 --> 01:12:43.798]  We'll be back in just a few minutes.
[01:12:43.798 --> 01:12:44.458]  Please stay with us.
[01:12:51.408 --> 01:12:51.909]  We're good to go.
[01:13:10.652 --> 01:13:14.453]  The stuff you come up with is just unbelievable.
[01:13:14.453 --> 01:13:15.454]  We'd like you to be in movies.
[01:13:15.454 --> 01:13:16.694]  We'd like you to write with us.
[01:13:16.694 --> 01:13:18.655]  We'd like you to do voiceovers.
[01:13:18.655 --> 01:13:19.875]  You're just a renaissance man.
[01:13:19.875 --> 01:13:23.476]  Folks know I was in some movies and Harry Shearer makes statements like that and a lot of others.
[01:13:23.476 --> 01:13:24.837]  I'm not bragging.
[01:13:24.837 --> 01:13:25.817]  I kept explaining to them.
[01:13:25.817 --> 01:13:27.778]  I said, do you understand?
[01:13:27.778 --> 01:13:29.878]  I didn't come up with any of this.
[01:13:29.878 --> 01:13:34.200]  I'm reading globalist MIT white papers and futurist documents.
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:37.141]  And they would just laugh at me and say, oh, no way.
[01:13:37.141 --> 01:13:38.942]  Then I would give them the documents.
[01:13:38.942 --> 01:13:40.182]  They would get very, very scared.
[01:13:40.520 --> 01:13:43.402]  You know, the next time I saw him in a few months, I'd say, man, you're right.
[01:13:43.402 --> 01:13:44.583]  This is dystopic.
[01:13:44.583 --> 01:13:46.865]  Folks, I didn't make any of this up.
[01:13:46.865 --> 01:13:47.305]  Okay.
[01:13:47.305 --> 01:13:47.946]  It's real.
[01:13:47.946 --> 01:13:49.026]  It's real.
[01:13:49.026 --> 01:13:53.250]  The reasons that the globalists launch this planetary lockdown.
[01:13:53.250 --> 01:13:57.433]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[01:13:57.433 --> 01:14:01.916]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[01:14:01.916 --> 01:14:06.880]  The cashless society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[01:14:08.049 --> 01:14:24.194]  The most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential, as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[01:14:24.194 --> 01:14:28.255]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[01:14:28.255 --> 01:14:31.416]  It's been pre-planned, organized, globally.
[01:14:31.416 --> 01:14:33.637]  And it's extremely predatory.
[01:14:33.637 --> 01:14:37.798]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations,
[01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:45.416]  The central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[01:14:45.416 --> 01:14:52.643]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[01:14:52.643 --> 01:14:55.425]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:15:08.758 --> 01:15:11.721]  Joe Collins is going to be in the studio with us next hour.
[01:15:11.721 --> 01:15:14.143]  He's running against Maxine Waters.
[01:15:14.143 --> 01:15:17.645]  Got some nice folks that have brought him here to be in the studio with us today.
[01:15:17.645 --> 01:15:18.967]  So we look forward to that.
[01:15:18.967 --> 01:15:20.648]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:15:20.648 --> 01:15:23.490]  Right now, let's go ahead and go back to your phone calls.
[01:15:23.490 --> 01:15:28.294]  I'm going to go in the order that these calls have been received.
[01:15:28.294 --> 01:15:33.438]  So up next would be... Let's go to Matthew in Michigan.
[01:15:33.438 --> 01:15:34.319]  Matthew, thanks for holding.
[01:15:34.319 --> 01:15:35.880]  Go ahead.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.162]  Hey Alex, how are you doing, sir?
[01:15:37.162 --> 01:15:37.642]  I'm good, brother.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:46.880]  I am kind of concerned with everything going on because Deacon Fishkin has kind of mentioned earlier with Whitmer mandating the mask.
[01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:47.501]  I've gone into
[01:15:48.289 --> 01:15:53.394]  Uh, different stores, and I've been had to turn away because I'm not going to wear a mask, and I've been turned away because I haven't been wearing a mask.
[01:15:53.394 --> 01:15:58.198]  So that's kind of concerning there, how people turn into sheep and will do anything they can to feel safe.
[01:15:58.198 --> 01:16:02.502]  Just imagine what they'll do when vaccines, uh, and make them with the Fourth of October.
[01:16:02.502 --> 01:16:04.063]  Well, that's what this is all a test for.
[01:16:04.063 --> 01:16:05.424]  We're being inducted into the cult.
[01:16:05.424 --> 01:16:09.228]  We're not joining the Marine Corps or the Army and being put through boot camp to make sure we're part of the club.
[01:16:09.228 --> 01:16:11.169]  We're being put into a cult of communism.
[01:16:11.169 --> 01:16:12.771]  But the Georgia governor says it's illegal.
[01:16:13.451 --> 01:16:18.195]  The 5th Circuit and other courts are saying it's illegal to make folks wear masks.
[01:16:18.195 --> 01:16:20.477]  If you have anxiety, you just say, I have a medical issue.
[01:16:20.477 --> 01:16:21.938]  They're not allowed to ask you.
[01:16:21.938 --> 01:16:25.541]  So again, this is all an attempt to force you into this.
[01:16:25.541 --> 01:16:26.482]  Correct.
[01:16:26.482 --> 01:16:33.928]  And to get into the next point I wanted to bring up quick was, what can we do as well as Trump do?
[01:16:33.928 --> 01:16:36.791]  So this biggest point, I think, is going to be on us.
[01:16:36.791 --> 01:16:39.633]  As General Flynn called us, the digital soldiers.
[01:16:40.339 --> 01:16:53.525]  We need to continue to fight and I think right now there is a great awakening that has happened and I know that was kind of the title of your show today about everything going on when it comes to like this Chrissy Teigen and then the pedophilia being exposed.
[01:16:53.525 --> 01:17:08.933]  I've seen left-wing people on my friends start to turn into and notice the sex trafficking and the child trafficking as well as people left-wing that have turned against the government Fauci and not wearing the mask and noticed it was all a big political thing because at first it was just to flatten the curve.
[01:17:09.426 --> 01:17:15.168]  Now, as you talked about in one of your videos earlier, just keep tightening the noose and tightening it tighter and tighter.
[01:17:15.168 --> 01:17:15.989]  Well, that's it, brother.
[01:17:15.989 --> 01:17:16.889]  Great points, Matthew.
[01:17:16.889 --> 01:17:18.129]  Thanks for the call.
[01:17:18.129 --> 01:17:19.350]  Okay, who's up next here?
[01:17:19.350 --> 01:17:22.511]  Let's go to another caller in Ohio.
[01:17:22.511 --> 01:17:23.432]  Matt, you're on the air.
[01:17:23.432 --> 01:17:26.033]  Matt, go ahead.
[01:17:26.033 --> 01:17:27.153]  Hey, how's it going, brother?
[01:17:27.153 --> 01:17:27.353]  Good.
[01:17:27.353 --> 01:17:29.154]  Thanks for calling.
[01:17:29.154 --> 01:17:30.294]  No problem.
[01:17:30.294 --> 01:17:35.956]  First, before I get to my point, I just want to tell you, DeWine, our governor, is out of control himself.
[01:17:35.956 --> 01:17:36.997]  Last night, he even had a
[01:17:37.884 --> 01:17:42.606]  Press conference, uh, pretty much, you know, asking Ohioans to wear masks.
[01:17:42.606 --> 01:17:45.787]  And then he was smirking the whole entire time during the thing.
[01:17:45.787 --> 01:17:49.008]  You can go back and even probably find me a whole entire press conference.
[01:17:49.008 --> 01:17:53.009]  And I hope Trump does something about the wine because he's honestly out of control.
[01:17:53.009 --> 01:17:54.750]  He's on a power trip himself.
[01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:58.831]  And honestly, governors cannot, you know, make laws, you know?
[01:17:58.831 --> 01:18:02.793]  So, I mean, yeah, they'll mandate stuff, but like you said, it's against our freedom.
[01:18:02.793 --> 01:18:03.733]  It's totally illegal.
[01:18:04.241 --> 01:18:10.026]  And now we even have stores here in Ohio saying that you can't come into their property unless you wear a mask.
[01:18:10.026 --> 01:18:11.847]  Walmart came out and announced that.
[01:18:11.847 --> 01:18:13.348]  Kroger came out and announced that.
[01:18:13.348 --> 01:18:19.913]  All kinds of stores are coming out and announcing that you can't even go shop inside their stores unless you wear a mask.
[01:18:19.913 --> 01:18:23.196]  And my point is, I think this is leading to the Mark of the Beast system.
[01:18:23.196 --> 01:18:25.918]  You know, versus no mask, you know, no service.
[01:18:26.345 --> 01:18:28.546]  And then it's going to lead to the mark of the beast.
[01:18:28.546 --> 01:18:29.386]  Well, sir, you're right.
[01:18:29.386 --> 01:18:39.291]  Bill Gates admits it's for contact tracing, forced inoculation, and preparing you to have apps on your phone to be able to buy and sell or get in your car and drive down the road.
[01:18:39.291 --> 01:18:41.692]  That's what they're getting us ready for.
[01:18:41.692 --> 01:18:42.192]  Yep.
[01:18:42.192 --> 01:18:44.353]  And it's the cash of society, like you said.
[01:18:44.353 --> 01:18:48.595]  And then another point I wanted to make, because I know you have callers back, you know, backed up.
[01:18:48.595 --> 01:18:50.056]  Check out Justin Bieber.
[01:18:50.056 --> 01:18:51.657]  He had a video a while back called Yummy.
[01:18:52.156 --> 01:18:57.778]  And he was exposing the whole entire industry, the pedophile elite, in that video.
[01:18:57.778 --> 01:18:59.839]  If you've never checked that out, go check that out too.
[01:18:59.839 --> 01:19:02.900]  I recommend that because I think... I heard he was.
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:03.620]  I didn't watch it.
[01:19:03.620 --> 01:19:04.721]  What's he cover?
[01:19:04.721 --> 01:19:05.361]  What's he cover?
[01:19:05.361 --> 01:19:09.683]  He exposes how they're, you know, eating children pretty much in the video.
[01:19:09.683 --> 01:19:12.764]  If you go watch the video, he shows how they're, you know, taking advantage of children.
[01:19:12.764 --> 01:19:18.826]  And even at the end of the video, it shows like a child's dress laid behind and stuff like that.
[01:19:18.826 --> 01:19:20.807]  And he also had a guy in there looking like Podesta.
[01:19:21.249 --> 01:19:23.731]  It's actually a very enlightening video.
[01:19:23.731 --> 01:19:28.834]  And he even actually touched his hat subliminally because a person asked him on Instagram.
[01:19:28.834 --> 01:19:31.035]  He's like, hey, was this really what this was about?
[01:19:31.035 --> 01:19:34.357]  And he touched his hat and let people know that, you know, that's what it was about.
[01:19:34.764 --> 01:19:37.186]  And one last thing, I do have a channel myself on YouTube.
[01:19:37.186 --> 01:19:40.308]  I mean, they're trying to shadow ban me called Truth Seeker.
[01:19:40.308 --> 01:19:45.231]  And I have a video talking about the Chrissy Teigen stuff on there if y'all want to try to find me and watch that.
[01:19:45.231 --> 01:19:46.612]  But they've been trying to shadow ban me.
[01:19:46.612 --> 01:19:50.655]  But, you know, it's just ridiculous how YouTube... But brother, you're fighting back and that's what matters.
[01:19:50.655 --> 01:19:51.856]  Tell us your YouTube channel again.
[01:19:51.856 --> 01:19:51.956]  Yep.
[01:19:52.842 --> 01:19:54.383]  It's called Truth Seeker.
[01:19:54.383 --> 01:19:55.204]  It's all one word.
[01:19:55.204 --> 01:19:56.104]  Truth Seeker.
[01:19:56.104 --> 01:19:58.266]  I can even email it to you if you want to check it out.
[01:19:58.266 --> 01:19:58.946]  Alright, brother.
[01:19:58.946 --> 01:20:00.047]  Thank you so much, Matt.
[01:20:00.047 --> 01:20:06.951]  Yeah, the system uses children and the abuse of children as a currency and for control and for blackmail and the whole thing's coming down.
[01:20:06.951 --> 01:20:16.558]  So they can try to make us wear masks and they can try to start wars and they can try to implode the economy, but they are being exposed and they know it.
[01:20:18.553 --> 01:20:21.575]  Alright, let's go to Walt in New York.
[01:20:21.575 --> 01:20:22.596]  Walt, you're on the air.
[01:20:22.596 --> 01:20:23.817]  Thanks for holding.
[01:20:23.817 --> 01:20:24.858]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:20:24.858 --> 01:20:25.918]  Good, brother.
[01:20:25.918 --> 01:20:27.760]  Alex, there's two points I want to make.
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:31.242]  The first point is that the time is very short to the election.
[01:20:31.242 --> 01:20:34.044]  Trump needs to leverage the electronic media.
[01:20:34.044 --> 01:20:37.807]  And to do that, he should borrow an idea from FDR, Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
[01:20:38.263 --> 01:20:41.565]  He needs fireside chats on a dedicated web channel.
[01:20:41.565 --> 01:20:43.966]  He can set that up and come on a regular basis.
[01:20:43.966 --> 01:20:45.366]  He can talk directly to the people.
[01:20:45.366 --> 01:20:48.468]  He's very effective and he'll swing the election with that.
[01:20:48.468 --> 01:20:51.389]  I agree because they've shut down his rallies with the COVID hoax.
[01:20:51.389 --> 01:20:59.413]  He should just have virtual rallies and then and then say send out invites to say a hundred people maybe he takes questions from or something digitally.
[01:20:59.413 --> 01:21:02.494]  Wonderful idea and the second thing is I think he should
[01:21:03.206 --> 01:21:19.780]  On one of those channels, talk about Roger Stone and say he wants to extend a full pardon to Roger Stone, then Roger Stone is a force to be reckoned with and he can dedicate his full time, instead of raising money, he can dedicate his full time to re-elect the president and he's very effective, he's a very powerful person.
[01:21:21.198 --> 01:21:22.259]  I agree with you, brother.
[01:21:22.259 --> 01:21:26.263]  Do you agree with me that I think the Globals are losing right now, but not by much?
[01:21:26.263 --> 01:21:28.485]  And I think they're going to launch some new big scam.
[01:21:28.485 --> 01:21:30.807]  We've already seen so many hoaxes, so many frauds.
[01:21:30.807 --> 01:21:31.468]  Do you agree with me?
[01:21:31.468 --> 01:21:33.130]  And what do you think the next fraud might be?
[01:21:34.284 --> 01:21:36.366]  I don't know, but I'll say this, Alex.
[01:21:36.366 --> 01:21:38.407]  The electronic media is the way to go.
[01:21:38.407 --> 01:21:41.330]  You have to have the power of the electronic media.
[01:21:41.330 --> 01:21:43.051]  And Trump was kind of slow on that.
[01:21:43.051 --> 01:21:46.594]  He's an older generation, and he didn't pick up on that soon enough.
[01:21:46.594 --> 01:21:47.875]  And we have censorship.
[01:21:47.875 --> 01:21:48.375]  We have all this.
[01:21:48.375 --> 01:21:54.540]  But he could set up a dedicated channel, and he could talk directly to the people and go around all these people.
[01:21:54.540 --> 01:21:57.943]  As long as the web is up, he can do that, and he'll overcome anything.
[01:21:57.943 --> 01:21:58.643]  Exactly.
[01:21:58.643 --> 01:22:00.064]  And now he's gotten rid of Brad.
[01:22:00.825 --> 01:22:03.906]  Parscale, who's not a bad guy, but just as naive.
[01:22:03.906 --> 01:22:05.927]  So I think Trump realizes he's in trouble.
[01:22:05.927 --> 01:22:10.710]  And that's good, because look, they have external polls that are fake, showing him losing by a huge margin.
[01:22:10.710 --> 01:22:14.932]  But his real polls show him slipping to a very thin margin of victory.
[01:22:14.932 --> 01:22:18.133]  And so if you add election fraud against that, they will win.
[01:22:18.133 --> 01:22:22.135]  So Trump, with 109 days out, you can see he's starting to make some major moves.
[01:22:22.674 --> 01:22:28.759]  Well, way back at the time of Franklin Roosevelt, all they had was radio, and it was extremely powerful then, and he knew it.
[01:22:28.759 --> 01:22:29.400]  Can you imagine?
[01:22:29.400 --> 01:22:32.843]  He needs to have a big topic every night, on video.
[01:22:32.843 --> 01:22:33.984]  They'll all tune into it.
[01:22:33.984 --> 01:22:36.766]  He needs to have a new subject, a new thing he addresses every night.
[01:22:36.766 --> 01:22:37.667]  I totally agree with you.
[01:22:37.667 --> 01:22:38.067]  Thank you, sir.
[01:22:38.067 --> 01:22:39.028]  That's the answer.
[01:22:39.028 --> 01:22:41.170]  Thank you, Walt.
[01:22:41.170 --> 01:22:44.953]  Alright, we got two more segments ahead of...
[01:22:47.196 --> 01:22:48.197]  Matt Bracken taking over.
[01:22:48.197 --> 01:22:54.584]  And there's a doctor who's a state senator in Minnesota who's done a great job exposing COVID as an overblown hoax.
[01:22:54.584 --> 01:22:56.346]  They're trying to take his license right now.
[01:22:56.346 --> 01:22:59.430]  We're going to air a few segments of that at the start of the next hour.
[01:22:59.430 --> 01:23:02.113]  But I've got a bunch of other news I want to hit as well.
[01:23:02.113 --> 01:23:02.834]  Please don't forget.
[01:23:04.650 --> 01:23:14.982]  We have Christmas in July sale, store-wide free shipping, double Patriot points, and all these items that were sold out that are back in, we have those on sale as well.
[01:23:14.982 --> 01:23:20.048]  But I'll tell you, as soon as I'm able to sell the new products we've got, I've got to get one more certificate.
[01:23:21.036 --> 01:23:22.898]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask.
[01:23:51.007 --> 01:23:52.788]  At InfowarStore.com.
[01:23:52.788 --> 01:23:54.429]  You can wear them out to political events.
[01:23:54.429 --> 01:23:56.130]  You can trigger lib darts.
[01:23:56.130 --> 01:24:03.273]  One of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or at Halloween.
[01:24:03.273 --> 01:24:09.536]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[01:24:09.536 --> 01:24:15.099]  It's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the forced inoculations and contact tracing of their openly.
[01:24:15.481 --> 01:24:15.781]  I think so.
[01:24:26.676 --> 01:24:31.078]  It's just as useless as the stupid cloth masks that you're wearing.
[01:24:31.078 --> 01:24:34.900]  And the M95 masks only control what's coming in, not what's going out.
[01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:36.981]  So they quote, spread COVID-19.
[01:24:36.981 --> 01:24:38.462]  They don't protect from it.
[01:24:38.462 --> 01:24:41.423]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back in these control freak spaces.
[01:24:41.423 --> 01:24:44.065]  You buy one for $9.95, you get four more free.
[01:24:44.065 --> 01:24:45.065]  They're at cost.
[01:24:45.065 --> 01:24:46.466]  Infowarrestore.com.
[01:24:47.489 --> 01:24:57.824]  The bad news is Western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist Chinese style total net surveillance, censorship with AI.
[01:24:57.824 --> 01:25:02.530]  The good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government COVID takeover.
[01:25:03.211 --> 01:25:11.576]  This planetary corporate reset that COVID covers for, because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them.
[01:25:11.576 --> 01:25:31.448]  And the good news is there's still sites like band.video, newswars.com, infowars.com, paulwatsonsitesummit.news, and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king, that is queen, that is the master of our own
[01:25:32.108 --> 01:25:33.128]  Destinies.
[01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:40.071]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a war on reality, a war on civilization, a war on our health, a war on our economy.
[01:25:40.071 --> 01:25:44.553]  But being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it will defeat it.
[01:25:44.553 --> 01:25:48.334]  So take action or be slaves.
[01:25:48.334 --> 01:25:56.477]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[01:25:57.799 --> 01:26:02.540]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.
[01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:04.900]  Super Male Vitality!
[01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:13.742]  Specifically designed to assist the body in regulating proper balance to create superior vitality in males.
[01:26:13.742 --> 01:26:24.664]  Now look, this unique formula promotes your body's own natural responses and it contains no synthetic chemicals and no unwanted additives.
[01:26:24.904 --> 01:26:25.584]  Yes.
[01:26:25.584 --> 01:26:30.485]  We're talking about ancient wisdom combined with modern technology.
[01:26:30.485 --> 01:26:37.306]  Working together in perfect synchronicity to help you get the most out of this herb-packed formula.
[01:26:37.306 --> 01:26:38.466]  So what are you waiting for?
[01:26:38.466 --> 01:26:40.327]  Go to the InfoWars store.
[01:26:40.327 --> 01:26:43.127]  Never been a better time than right now.
[01:26:43.127 --> 01:26:50.688]  Super Male Vitality at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:26:50.688 --> 01:26:53.349]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:27:04.403 --> 01:27:09.324]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:27:09.324 --> 01:27:17.085]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:27:17.085 --> 01:27:20.106]  Welcome back I'm your host Alex Jones Monday through Friday 11 a.m.
[01:27:20.106 --> 01:27:20.666]  to 3 p.m.
[01:27:20.666 --> 01:27:30.488]  Central here we are taking a lot of phone calls and then next hour we have a guest in studio then Matt Bracken is coming up we're continuing with your phone calls
[01:27:31.755 --> 01:27:32.935]  Right now?
[01:27:32.935 --> 01:27:36.396]  Let's see who's been holding the longest here, and then I have one little piece of news.
[01:27:36.396 --> 01:27:39.037]  I don't want to hit on the vaccine front.
[01:27:39.037 --> 01:27:40.417]  Who's been holding the longest?
[01:27:40.417 --> 01:27:41.077]  Is it Kenny?
[01:27:41.077 --> 01:27:43.358]  Or is it Alex?
[01:27:43.358 --> 01:27:44.478]  I think it's one of those.
[01:27:44.478 --> 01:27:45.418]  Or is it Andre?
[01:27:45.418 --> 01:27:49.719]  We're going to go to Kenny in Ohio here in just a moment.
[01:27:49.719 --> 01:27:54.821]  But first, bad news for Moderna.
[01:27:54.821 --> 01:27:59.602]  That's one of the companies that Fauci and Gates are invested in, and the NIH owns part of the vaccine.
[01:28:00.458 --> 01:28:03.159]  Not a conflict of interest or anything.
[01:28:03.159 --> 01:28:05.940]  Just let the weasel run the hen house, that's all.
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:07.100]  Bad news for Moderna.
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:13.642]  More evidence shows COVID-19 antibodies disappear not long after the infection.
[01:28:13.642 --> 01:28:15.102]  The vaccine doesn't work.
[01:28:15.102 --> 01:28:17.163]  Big article on ZeroEdge.
[01:28:17.163 --> 01:28:17.703]  Meanwhile...
[01:28:18.973 --> 01:28:21.436]  This man behind the curtains got something for you.
[01:28:21.436 --> 01:28:24.218]  He does want to depopulate you, but you should trust him.
[01:28:24.218 --> 01:28:30.325]  Bill Gates says Indian pharma industry soon able to produce COVID-19 vaccine for entire world!
[01:28:32.059 --> 01:28:45.172]  Yes, even though they've got all these ill effects and side effects and illnesses from the vaccine, they're reporting in the Associated Press that half the people in vaccine trials are getting very sick and having adverse reactions.
[01:28:45.172 --> 01:28:48.275]  See, the vaccine is the real COVID-19.
[01:28:48.275 --> 01:28:50.597]  It's the real bio-attack.
[01:28:50.597 --> 01:28:55.402]  And they're getting you trained to wear the mask and don't leave your house so you'll accept this in the future.
[01:28:55.402 --> 01:28:55.903]  This is it!
[01:28:58.732 --> 01:29:00.414]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls here.
[01:29:00.414 --> 01:29:03.917]  Let's talk to Kenny in Ohio.
[01:29:03.917 --> 01:29:04.798]  Kenny, you're on the air.
[01:29:04.798 --> 01:29:07.260]  How are you doing, Alex?
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:07.600]  Good, sir.
[01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:07.840]  Go ahead.
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:24.396]  I want to talk about the psychological issues that are going on right now with people going to be forced back into their homes, back away from society, and what it's going to cause for people that are on the cusp of mental breakdown, taking everything away from us, shove us back in.
[01:29:25.758 --> 01:29:36.787]  Well that's right, it's causing depression, it's causing breakdown of society, it's causing people to go into debt, it's causing major homes to be repossessed.
[01:29:36.787 --> 01:29:44.374]  It's siege to make us blame America and blame Trump.
[01:29:44.374 --> 01:29:47.016]  I think you're muffling your phone.
[01:29:47.016 --> 01:29:47.977]  Take your hand off your phone.
[01:29:53.334 --> 01:29:54.554]  Part of their psyche.
[01:29:54.554 --> 01:29:56.975]  It's going to destroy everything.
[01:29:56.975 --> 01:29:58.236]  That's what they're planning to do.
[01:29:58.236 --> 01:30:04.978]  If they can't physically do it, they're going to mentally break us down to where everybody's forced to live in their homes and not come back out.
[01:30:04.978 --> 01:30:06.018]  And that's right.
[01:30:06.018 --> 01:30:10.820]  But if you're aware of someone trying to oppress you and don't give up, it makes you stronger.
[01:30:10.820 --> 01:30:13.281]  If you have Stockholm Syndrome and submit, they win.
[01:30:13.281 --> 01:30:19.423]  But if you're aware they're trying to break your will and decide to be happy and more successful and expose them, they get defeated.
[01:30:19.423 --> 01:30:20.263]  You see their gamble.
[01:30:22.233 --> 01:30:23.274]  Yeah, it's basically what they want.
[01:30:23.274 --> 01:30:25.515]  They want us all to be robots.
[01:30:25.515 --> 01:30:27.396]  And that's not going to happen.
[01:30:27.396 --> 01:30:30.118]  I mean, it's already started with the Walmarts, bus buys.
[01:30:30.118 --> 01:30:33.340]  Now you can't even, they can't have cash.
[01:30:33.340 --> 01:30:36.863]  Oh yeah, it's all the big corporations are the ones that are doing this.
[01:30:36.863 --> 01:30:38.184]  They're the ones behind it.
[01:30:38.184 --> 01:30:39.164]  So why support them?
[01:30:39.164 --> 01:30:40.385]  Why go to them?
[01:30:40.385 --> 01:30:41.486]  Because they're out to get you.
[01:30:41.486 --> 01:30:42.827]  You can't shop with them.
[01:30:42.827 --> 01:30:45.208]  You have to let them know.
[01:30:45.208 --> 01:30:47.149]  Sometimes it's the only place you can go for those.
[01:30:48.516 --> 01:30:51.719]  You know, 15 miles away from a Walmart in each section.
[01:30:51.719 --> 01:30:52.780]  Sir, I understand that.
[01:30:52.780 --> 01:30:55.201]  That's why you're going to have to drive further and pay more.
[01:30:55.201 --> 01:30:58.464]  Because in the end, they're going to tell you to take a brain shift or the mark of the beast to go there.
[01:30:58.464 --> 01:31:01.366]  I mean, that's been their plan.
[01:31:01.366 --> 01:31:02.107]  I'm not going to do it.
[01:31:02.107 --> 01:31:03.788]  I'm not going to comply.
[01:31:03.788 --> 01:31:04.589]  I understand.
[01:31:04.589 --> 01:31:05.930]  But now is the time to say no.
[01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:06.551]  God bless you, Kenny.
[01:31:06.551 --> 01:31:07.351]  I appreciate your call.
[01:31:07.351 --> 01:31:07.792]  Good points.
[01:31:07.792 --> 01:31:14.137]  Let's talk to Alex in Michigan, where the governor is completely out of control.
[01:31:14.137 --> 01:31:16.319]  Alex, you're on the air.
[01:31:16.319 --> 01:31:17.720]  Thank you for taking my call, Alex.
[01:31:18.565 --> 01:31:24.346]  I wanted to address your last caller's question about what products also decalcify the pineal gland.
[01:31:24.346 --> 01:31:34.068]  The Body's product from InfoWareStore.com will take fluoride out of your system if your crew wants to just do a quick search of fluoride removal using turmeric.
[01:31:34.068 --> 01:31:36.169]  Get all kinds of articles.
[01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:41.430]  And I'm not bragging, but if you listen to this phone call, we can save America right now.
[01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:43.790]  If you don't cut me short, I got some points to make.
[01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:45.730]  I got the blueprint right here.
[01:31:45.730 --> 01:31:48.071]  The Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ is going to lead me through this.
[01:31:48.886 --> 01:31:52.469]  And we're going to defeat the Night of Malta Globalist Eugenics Umbrella Corp.
[01:31:52.469 --> 01:31:55.911]  With the Rothschilds, Gates, and Sorases are all Knights of Malta.
[01:31:55.911 --> 01:32:00.774]  And above them, you have the Jesuit Black Nobility and the Black Pope.
[01:32:00.774 --> 01:32:09.660]  And above that, you have these Merovingian bloodlines that are the Nephilim Fallen Angel type evil dudes running things right now.
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:18.026]  But to save America, Trump needs to fire Jesuit Fauci, put Mike Adams as the National Health Director.
[01:32:18.740 --> 01:32:23.105]  And then, if we can't save America, we have to move to Greenland.
[01:32:23.105 --> 01:32:33.255]  We have to move to Greenland and we have to start hemp farms, any kind of farms, get some product, get our GDP going.
[01:32:33.255 --> 01:32:41.404]  We'll take this remnant of America that still loves America, we'll just take all our ideas to Greenland, and the rest of you scum that don't want to
[01:32:42.345 --> 01:32:46.087]  Alright Alex, I appreciate your call.
[01:32:46.087 --> 01:32:47.267]  Good to hear from you.
[01:32:47.267 --> 01:32:48.868]  Alright, let's go ahead and take another call here.
[01:32:48.868 --> 01:32:51.449]  We're taking a lot of calls today.
[01:32:51.449 --> 01:32:52.829]  You guys are doing a great job.
[01:32:52.829 --> 01:32:54.430]  Andre in New York, thanks for holding.
[01:32:54.430 --> 01:32:56.511]  You're on the air.
[01:32:56.511 --> 01:32:58.171]  Hi Alex.
[01:32:58.171 --> 01:33:06.294]  So yesterday, Cuomo, late last night, Cuomo decided to put police in all of the airports.
[01:33:06.294 --> 01:33:10.516]  Oh yeah, even though courts say it's unconstitutional, the medical checkpoints he's setting up, he's doing it.
[01:33:11.664 --> 01:33:13.225]  Right, but here's the good news.
[01:33:13.225 --> 01:33:18.468]  The good news is that he admitted that the contact tracing isn't working.
[01:33:18.468 --> 01:33:21.310]  That people are not giving him the information.
[01:33:21.310 --> 01:33:23.832]  So this is why he's doing that.
[01:33:23.832 --> 01:33:24.752]  He said that.
[01:33:24.752 --> 01:33:29.275]  And another thing is, I'm telling you right now, New York is going red.
[01:33:29.275 --> 01:33:34.879]  Because there's a lot of people that are the silent majority.
[01:33:34.879 --> 01:33:37.160]  I feel that way is going in California.
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:38.401]  And the more that they do this,
[01:33:39.164 --> 01:33:40.586]  The more it's going to get worse.
[01:33:40.586 --> 01:33:45.992]  But by the way, let me raise that because I think even a few weeks ago, Trump was in trouble, but I can see it.
[01:33:45.992 --> 01:33:47.113]  I can feel it.
[01:33:47.113 --> 01:33:49.175]  I think the public's really waking up.
[01:33:49.175 --> 01:33:55.282]  Police all over the country are refusing to wear masks in big cities like L.A., New York, Austin.
[01:33:55.282 --> 01:33:56.683]  The people are seeing through it.
[01:33:56.683 --> 01:33:58.445]  I think they've really pushed too far.
[01:33:58.445 --> 01:33:58.926]  What do you think?
[01:34:00.239 --> 01:34:11.966]  Well, what I think is, is there's, like I said, a silent majority because he even came out and said he knows there's a lot more people voting for him, but they don't want to deal with the people that hate him, number one.
[01:34:11.966 --> 01:34:19.531]  Number two, I am such a big advocate of his because I'm around your age, so I've been watching Trump, you know, from way back.
[01:34:19.531 --> 01:34:23.413]  He's been saying the same thing over and over.
[01:34:23.413 --> 01:34:28.716]  Everything he has been saying has been legit with China, with this, with that.
[01:34:28.716 --> 01:34:29.957]  And one important thing,
[01:34:30.478 --> 01:34:38.540]  This man was able to build in Manhattan with the okay from the mafia, okay?
[01:34:38.540 --> 01:34:39.360]  Five families.
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:51.423]  If he can't take down the globalists and the deep state, and he could deal with the five families in New York, if you are not from New York, you don't understand it.
[01:34:51.423 --> 01:34:53.604]  If you're from New York, you totally get it.
[01:34:53.604 --> 01:34:55.664]  He will defeat them.
[01:34:55.664 --> 01:34:58.585]  And I really feel confident about that, so I just wanted to let you know.
[01:35:00.151 --> 01:35:01.552]  What you're saying is absolutely true.
[01:35:01.552 --> 01:35:04.033]  And look, Trump's totally for real.
[01:35:04.033 --> 01:35:06.634]  He's surrounded, but he has right on his side.
[01:35:06.634 --> 01:35:09.216]  And that's why the enemy is so desperate, though.
[01:35:09.216 --> 01:35:12.677]  Because every time they run a new hoax, it ends up failing.
[01:35:12.677 --> 01:35:14.378]  So they expand the hoax.
[01:35:14.378 --> 01:35:15.679]  I'm just concerned.
[01:35:15.679 --> 01:35:18.680]  I'm asking listeners, what do you think the next big thing is going to be?
[01:35:18.680 --> 01:35:21.962]  Because you know with 109 days out, I mean, they're going to pull something else.
[01:35:21.962 --> 01:35:23.323]  What do you think, Andre?
[01:35:24.472 --> 01:35:41.439]  Well, what I think is they're just going to expand on this COVID because, like, I had a girlfriend, she just left New York on Saturday to move down to Florida and she said there was a checkpoint in Atlanta, there was no cops in Atlanta.
[01:35:41.439 --> 01:35:42.939]  So she went right through.
[01:35:42.939 --> 01:35:45.100]  So that's another lie that they're saying.
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:46.661]  They're not being able to get it.
[01:35:46.661 --> 01:35:49.982]  I don't know what the next big thing is, but I do know
[01:35:50.618 --> 01:35:59.404]  That without the police on the streets, and the big police organization just endorsed him yesterday, the bikers from Trump.
[01:35:59.404 --> 01:36:01.926]  Oh yeah, I want to tell listeners, it's not hype that crime's exploded.
[01:36:01.926 --> 01:36:04.748]  Where I live, just crime is rampant now.
[01:36:04.748 --> 01:36:12.213]  Well, it's rampant, but I'll tell you what, it's rampant in the poor states, like this lovely, wonderful BSAOC.
[01:36:12.213 --> 01:36:14.095]  And Tucker Carlson is right on target.
[01:36:14.095 --> 01:36:14.515]  No, you're right.
[01:36:14.515 --> 01:36:17.077]  It's all the blue cities and blue states are hellholes.
[01:36:18.516 --> 01:36:22.937]  Right, but just in the city, outside of the city, in the suburbs, they're fine.
[01:36:22.937 --> 01:36:24.098]  I'm sure you live in a suburb.
[01:36:24.098 --> 01:36:25.238]  No, you're absolutely right.
[01:36:25.238 --> 01:36:25.918]  Thank you, Andre.
[01:36:25.918 --> 01:36:27.579]  Great points.
[01:36:27.579 --> 01:36:31.280]  Just imagine, folks, they literally are saying, turn the police off.
[01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:33.861]  This is villainous insanity.
[01:36:33.861 --> 01:36:35.501]  This is absolutely crazy.
[01:36:35.501 --> 01:36:40.263]  I mean, it's designed to create martial law.
[01:36:40.263 --> 01:36:41.403]  We're taking a lot of calls.
[01:36:41.403 --> 01:36:43.224]  We'll be right back with more of your calls on the other side.
[01:36:47.765 --> 01:36:49.527]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[01:36:49.527 --> 01:36:50.007]  You're on the air.
[01:36:50.007 --> 01:36:50.568]  Thanks for holding.
[01:36:50.568 --> 01:36:51.609]  Can you hear me?
[01:36:51.609 --> 01:36:52.249]  I sure can, sir.
[01:36:52.249 --> 01:36:52.589]  Thank you.
[01:36:52.589 --> 01:36:59.556]  Hey Alex, before I start, man, I just wanted to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right now with you, man.
[01:36:59.556 --> 01:37:00.877]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[01:37:03.579 --> 01:37:05.020]  I just want to plug in.
[01:37:05.020 --> 01:37:09.444]  I'm a truck driver and 2x4s have changed the way I drive.
[01:37:09.444 --> 01:37:16.089]  Me and my brothers that drive, a couple of us, we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans.
[01:37:16.089 --> 01:37:24.036]  We used to be on Monster and Red Bull and all that and I have lost weight because I stopped drinking all that sugar and I just want to thank
[01:37:24.136 --> 01:37:24.696]  Thank you for that, man.
[01:37:47.543 --> 01:38:03.095]  CNN, USA Today, and other mainstream media fake news outlets came out and said that a new Trump campaign t-shirt that has an American eagle spreading its wings, standing on top of an American flag, is Nazi!
[01:38:03.095 --> 01:38:10.982]  And they had the Soros-funded Snopes groups and others fact-check it and say, yes, now the American flag, and yes, the American eagle are Nazis.
[01:38:10.982 --> 01:38:12.223]  No, George Soros, the
[01:38:12.483 --> 01:38:13.143]  We're good to go.
[01:38:48.092 --> 01:38:50.693]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years.
[01:38:50.693 --> 01:39:03.479]  And if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate control society, how they'd be able to not just predict
[01:39:04.019 --> 01:39:04.419]  I think?
[01:39:24.051 --> 01:39:28.014]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up.
[01:39:28.014 --> 01:39:33.257]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate-level blueprint documents.
[01:39:33.257 --> 01:39:41.142]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[01:39:41.142 --> 01:39:44.964]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[01:39:44.964 --> 01:39:47.006]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[01:39:56.966 --> 01:40:05.033]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[01:40:05.033 --> 01:40:06.554]  Where did it come from?
[01:40:06.554 --> 01:40:11.918]  Infowarsstore.com We can't survive without pure, clean drinking water.

[01:40:44.133 --> 01:40:50.674]  Other systems, just don't compare.
[01:40:50.674 --> 01:40:53.275]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:40:59.555 --> 01:41:15.570]  Well, we've got a candidate who's got some good backers and is a good guy joining us in studio running against Maxine Waters.
[01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:18.133]  I'll continue with your phone calls right through.
[01:41:20.060 --> 01:41:22.841]  And then we've got, of course, Matt Bracken, who's got a lot to say.
[01:41:22.841 --> 01:41:24.042]  Always informative.
[01:41:24.042 --> 01:41:25.823]  Author, former Navy SEAL, patriot.
[01:41:25.823 --> 01:41:27.164]  Really a smart guy.
[01:41:27.164 --> 01:41:29.005]  He'll talk about what the Globals are planning next.
[01:41:29.005 --> 01:41:30.426]  That's what I've asked him to cover.
[01:41:30.426 --> 01:41:33.007]  That's coming up fourth hour ahead of the war with Owen Schroer.
[01:41:33.007 --> 01:41:34.408]  All right.
[01:41:34.408 --> 01:41:39.110]  Let's take five phone calls in the next ten and a half minutes we have in this segment.
[01:41:39.110 --> 01:41:42.232]  Who's been home the longest here?
[01:41:42.232 --> 01:41:46.874]  That would be... Shaggy in Texas, then Charles in Georgia.
[01:41:46.874 --> 01:41:47.655]  Shaggy, go ahead.
[01:41:48.857 --> 01:41:49.958]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:41:49.958 --> 01:41:52.659]  I want to make this quick and methodical.
[01:41:52.659 --> 01:41:56.882]  First of all, X2 will blow you away to include all InfoWars products, and that ain't no joke.
[01:41:56.882 --> 01:41:59.084]  Go ahead and grab them.
[01:41:59.084 --> 01:42:09.370]  I want to urge President Trump to make an executive order for forbidding contact tracing and an end to all these germophobic anti-human COVID measures.
[01:42:09.370 --> 01:42:14.954]  And another point, everyone needs to get back to the actual town square and begin the undoing of the global agenda.
[01:42:15.592 --> 01:42:17.853]  Putting a muzzle on we the people.
[01:42:17.853 --> 01:42:26.256]  Apply the pressure to all the pedophile networks to include Amazon, Wayfair, and every other pedo network and deal with them with extreme prejudice.
[01:42:26.256 --> 01:42:30.697]  Expose and destroy the anti-human agendas behind every giganet.
[01:42:30.697 --> 01:42:35.179]  The silent majority is the hard-working people that make this country so doggone great.
[01:42:35.179 --> 01:42:37.319]  God bless the USA and church.
[01:42:37.319 --> 01:42:41.521]  Start standing on the unshaken foundation the Lord has already established for you.
[01:42:42.096 --> 01:42:47.737]  When you email the White House, email the White House by WhiteHouse.gov.
[01:42:47.737 --> 01:42:49.818]  Alright, go to the contact portion.
[01:42:49.818 --> 01:42:50.778]  Email the President.
[01:42:50.778 --> 01:42:51.878]  Blow him up.
[01:42:51.878 --> 01:42:52.658]  Seriously.
[01:42:52.658 --> 01:42:54.458]  Every single American.
[01:42:54.458 --> 01:43:01.120]  No, I agree with you, Shaggy, but what do you make about Teigen, all these things, openly saying she likes pedophilia?
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:04.180]  I mean, these people are like out in the open.
[01:43:04.180 --> 01:43:07.201]  Yeah, no, this lady, this freaking demon,
[01:43:08.064 --> 01:43:14.126]  Um, she needs to be checked by the FBI time yesterday, time years ago.
[01:43:14.126 --> 01:43:15.006]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:43:15.006 --> 01:43:17.927]  You know, you know what's on our computers.
[01:43:17.927 --> 01:43:19.027]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:43:19.027 --> 01:43:27.990]  And that's, I mean, unless you bleach them, other than that, you can go ahead and sit through all that, all that demonic filth that these... And you're right.
[01:43:27.990 --> 01:43:28.870]  She's not a woman.
[01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:31.111]  She's an entity that's been taken over.
[01:43:31.954 --> 01:43:33.215]  Yeah, no, that's disgusting.
[01:43:33.215 --> 01:43:36.936]  They're completely into the satanic ritualism with spirit cooking and all that.
[01:43:36.936 --> 01:43:40.398]  So yeah, no, these people are demons and that's for sure.
[01:43:40.398 --> 01:43:41.298]  Powerful points, Jackie.
[01:43:41.298 --> 01:43:43.379]  We're going to jump to the next person as we get to everybody.
[01:43:43.379 --> 01:43:44.760]  Here she is talking about eating people.
[01:43:45.899 --> 01:43:50.182]  If the person okayed it, I would eat a human.
[01:43:50.182 --> 01:43:54.726]  If you were at a very fancy restaurant and they were like, a tiny piece of human meat.
[01:43:54.726 --> 01:43:55.386]  Not at all.
[01:43:55.386 --> 01:43:58.749]  I think the only way I would... You wouldn't try a tiny bite?
[01:43:58.749 --> 01:43:59.109]  No.
[01:43:59.109 --> 01:43:59.530]  Really?
[01:43:59.530 --> 01:44:00.310]  Absolutely not.
[01:44:00.310 --> 01:44:01.171]  You're so terrible.
[01:44:05.657 --> 01:44:14.824]  When I was having a dental implant put in, they wanted to put a piece of cadaver in my mouth for the post for the new tooth, when the other tooth got pulled.
[01:44:14.824 --> 01:44:17.266]  I said, nope, get me bovine.
[01:44:17.266 --> 01:44:18.446]  I've eaten enough beef anyways.
[01:44:18.446 --> 01:44:20.128]  And they said, yeah, it works just as good.
[01:44:20.128 --> 01:44:21.809]  I just don't want something else inside me.
[01:44:21.809 --> 01:44:23.530]  But the media spends it that I want to eat people.
[01:44:23.530 --> 01:44:25.672]  I said, this is John Szwed for the lawyers.
[01:44:25.672 --> 01:44:26.372]  I want to eat people.
[01:44:26.372 --> 01:44:28.174]  I'm saying society collapses.
[01:44:28.174 --> 01:44:29.234]  You guys are causing this.
[01:44:29.234 --> 01:44:29.915]  I'll eat my neighbors.
[01:44:29.915 --> 01:44:30.836]  I'll eat my liberal neighbors.
[01:44:32.242 --> 01:44:38.213]  As really a threat to say, you idiots get what you're doing?
[01:44:38.213 --> 01:44:39.936]  I'll cover that actually at the start of the next hour.
[01:44:40.851 --> 01:44:45.373]  Then I've got this medical doctor who's a state senator trying to fire because he exposed COVID as a fraud.
[01:44:45.373 --> 01:44:47.974]  I mean, since when can you not tell the truth?
[01:44:47.974 --> 01:44:49.935]  Well, since the left had cancel culture.
[01:44:49.935 --> 01:44:51.696]  The answer is don't give in to that.
[01:44:51.696 --> 01:44:52.876]  Say no to it.
[01:44:52.876 --> 01:44:53.457]  We've done it.
[01:44:53.457 --> 01:44:56.238]  We built our own network, our own platform, our own system.
[01:44:56.238 --> 01:44:59.279]  That's why every AM and FM station deserves your support.
[01:44:59.279 --> 01:45:02.901]  That's why InfoWars is here, is because of the affiliates.
[01:45:03.661 --> 01:45:04.461]  And the enemy knows that.
[01:45:04.461 --> 01:45:10.203]  They've targeted them, they've harassed them, but that actually made most of the affiliates take us from nighttime to live.
[01:45:10.203 --> 01:45:14.804]  When you call up threatening owners or program directors and tell them you're going to kill them, they don't take us off.
[01:45:14.804 --> 01:45:22.746]  Talk radio is a little bit different, so I almost don't want to tell the Deep State how they screwed up, but it doesn't work calling up threatening radio station owners.
[01:45:24.319 --> 01:45:25.279]  They're used to it.
[01:45:25.279 --> 01:45:26.720]  So that really backfired for you.
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:30.961]  You've got a lot more affiliates and better airtimes because of your debt threats.
[01:45:30.961 --> 01:45:33.802]  And I don't wish that on the stations, but know this.
[01:45:33.802 --> 01:45:37.423]  We don't know any stations bound to this crap.
[01:45:37.423 --> 01:45:40.524]  When Soros and Media Matters put a list of them out and tried to harass them.
[01:45:40.524 --> 01:45:42.804]  It had the opposite effect, dirtbags.
[01:45:42.804 --> 01:45:46.225]  Because not all Americans get on their knees in the face of threats.
[01:45:46.225 --> 01:45:49.246]  A lot of people dig their heels in and get pissed.
[01:45:49.246 --> 01:45:51.266]  And that's the spirit we need.
[01:45:51.266 --> 01:45:53.047]  Like this bean company.
[01:45:54.053 --> 01:45:55.494]  The president did do a great job.
[01:45:55.494 --> 01:45:58.697]  There's like five times the amount of food being donated than it ever has been.
[01:45:58.697 --> 01:46:01.580]  The poor are getting all the food they need.
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:03.442]  The globalists want them rioting out there.
[01:46:03.442 --> 01:46:08.807]  And then they tried to turn that into a bad thing that the bean company gave more beans than anybody else.
[01:46:08.807 --> 01:46:10.989]  It's like, it's sick.
[01:46:10.989 --> 01:46:12.450]  Alright, I said I'd go to five calls in this segment.
[01:46:12.450 --> 01:46:15.553]  I'll never do that now, but who's up next now here?
[01:46:15.553 --> 01:46:16.895]  Charles in Georgia.
[01:46:16.895 --> 01:46:17.815]  You're on the air, sir.
[01:46:17.815 --> 01:46:18.076]  Go ahead.
[01:46:19.659 --> 01:46:22.180]  Hey Alex, just talking about Trump making some big moves.
[01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:24.040]  I like that.
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:27.761]  There's a huge one running in the background that nobody's really thinking about.
[01:46:27.761 --> 01:46:30.641]  And it's so huge that Trump has to do it.
[01:46:30.641 --> 01:46:33.842]  Not only because it's the right thing to do, but it'll negate everything they're trying to do.
[01:46:33.842 --> 01:46:34.882]  He should move to parlour!
[01:46:34.882 --> 01:46:36.363]  No.
[01:46:36.363 --> 01:46:37.483]  No, no, no.
[01:46:37.483 --> 01:46:38.803]  No.
[01:46:38.803 --> 01:46:42.804]  People aren't thinking about the fact that they shut down the economy so people can't go back to work.
[01:46:42.804 --> 01:46:43.224]  Can't work.
[01:46:43.806 --> 01:46:48.088]  But while that's going on, everybody's credit reports are getting trashed in the background.
[01:46:48.088 --> 01:46:55.332]  Trump needs to come out and order the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the FTC to order the credit bureaus to give the entire country a credit reset.
[01:46:55.332 --> 01:46:56.372]  That is genius!
[01:46:56.372 --> 01:46:57.433]  A jubilee!
[01:46:57.433 --> 01:47:00.074]  Trump should call for a credit report jubilee.
[01:47:00.074 --> 01:47:01.335]  Everyone will back him.
[01:47:01.335 --> 01:47:02.315]  It's the right thing to do.
[01:47:02.315 --> 01:47:05.217]  The big banks position this to make us debt slaves.
[01:47:05.217 --> 01:47:07.978]  Trump must announce a credit jubilee.
[01:47:07.978 --> 01:47:09.739]  That is fricking genius!
[01:47:10.709 --> 01:47:11.249]  Absolutely.
[01:47:11.249 --> 01:47:14.091]  It undoes everything because they're trying to make everybody surfs.
[01:47:14.091 --> 01:47:23.596]  They get you caught in what's called the downward spiraling loop where your credit's trashed and you can't buy things like furniture and durable goods and freezers and refrigerators or any of that stuff if your credit's bad.
[01:47:23.596 --> 01:47:24.397]  You gotta have good credit.
[01:47:25.094 --> 01:47:26.897]  By the way, none of them are getting bailouts.
[01:47:26.897 --> 01:47:27.718]  That's what's so evil about this.
[01:47:27.718 --> 01:47:30.141]  And remember, the Democrats did this, folks, not Trump.
[01:47:42.458 --> 01:47:42.799]  Right.
[01:47:42.799 --> 01:47:46.884]  Restore their credit back to whatever their score was on like January 31st.
[01:47:46.884 --> 01:47:47.646]  No lates.
[01:47:47.646 --> 01:47:48.567]  No consumer late.
[01:47:48.567 --> 01:47:49.188]  No, I agree.
[01:47:49.188 --> 01:47:50.309]  Don't give them a perfect score.
[01:47:50.309 --> 01:47:51.191]  That'd be fraud.
[01:47:51.191 --> 01:47:53.975]  Restore it to what it was January 31st.
[01:47:53.975 --> 01:47:55.276]  You are damn right, sir.
[01:47:56.348 --> 01:47:57.929]  It undoes everything.
[01:47:57.929 --> 01:47:59.269]  We've got to get an article out.
[01:47:59.269 --> 01:48:00.430]  We've got to take a clip of this.
[01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:01.630]  We've got to get this to Trump.
[01:48:01.630 --> 01:48:03.091]  I'm going to talk to Roger Stone.
[01:48:03.091 --> 01:48:04.271]  I'm going to get ahold of Trump.
[01:48:04.271 --> 01:48:06.492]  This is absolutely genius.
[01:48:06.492 --> 01:48:10.474]  Because people just don't need a moratorium on bills, which shouldn't happen for most people.
[01:48:10.474 --> 01:48:13.795]  They needed to go back to where it was because they didn't do this.
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:17.122]  Yeah, they did it to everybody in the housing mess.
[01:48:17.122 --> 01:48:20.584]  Oh, it's like the Democrats rub their eyeballs in payday loans.
[01:48:20.584 --> 01:48:22.926]  They're all just... And again, every time I look, it's Democrats.
[01:48:22.926 --> 01:48:24.547]  You don't have Republicans doing that.
[01:48:24.547 --> 01:48:30.692]  I'm not even trying to lionize Republicans, but compared to Democrats, Republicans are like moron goody two-shoes, man.
[01:48:30.692 --> 01:48:33.915]  And the Democrats are a criminal, larcenous group of trash.
[01:48:35.273 --> 01:48:38.256]  Yeah, all these restaurant workers and everybody that are having their credit checked.
[01:48:38.256 --> 01:48:40.618]  Oh, everywhere I go, people are like, oh, we're glad to be reopened.
[01:48:40.618 --> 01:48:41.239]  We're glad you're here.
[01:48:41.239 --> 01:48:42.821]  And I go, did you get a bailout?
[01:48:42.821 --> 01:48:45.643]  Every waiter, every waitress, every bartender said no.
[01:48:45.643 --> 01:48:47.886]  They said, I'm mortgaging my house.
[01:48:47.886 --> 01:48:48.827]  I'm losing my house.
[01:48:48.827 --> 01:48:49.848]  It pisses me off.
[01:48:51.124 --> 01:48:51.584]  Yeah.
[01:48:51.584 --> 01:48:52.765]  Put their credit back.
[01:48:52.765 --> 01:48:53.706]  No late.
[01:48:53.706 --> 01:48:55.267]  Restore their oldest trade lines.
[01:48:55.267 --> 01:48:57.509]  And then he can put pressure on all these companies.
[01:48:57.509 --> 01:48:58.990]  Oh, it's for COVID.
[01:48:58.990 --> 01:49:00.571]  You big loan sharking banks.
[01:49:00.571 --> 01:49:02.033]  Oh, sir.
[01:49:02.033 --> 01:49:03.714]  Trump better do this.
[01:49:03.714 --> 01:49:05.175]  He better put pressure on to do it.
[01:49:05.175 --> 01:49:05.916]  Beautiful, sir.
[01:49:05.916 --> 01:49:07.277]  Any other genius ideas, Charles?
[01:49:08.257 --> 01:49:15.866]  Well, Biden and his credit card company people, you know, he's Mr. Credit Card Company, they're all foaming at the mouth that everybody's going to be stuck in serfdom.
[01:49:15.866 --> 01:49:17.548]  Trump needs to make a big deal out of this.
[01:49:17.548 --> 01:49:18.490]  Come out and say, hey, regular money.
[01:49:18.490 --> 01:49:19.010]  No, you're right.
[01:49:19.010 --> 01:49:20.192]  This will win the election.
[01:49:20.192 --> 01:49:24.177]  He makes it all about Mr. Credit Card Company, Biden, Mr. Loan Shark.
[01:49:24.657 --> 01:49:28.460]  Watch how fast the COVID thing disappears after everybody's credit gets restored, too.
[01:49:47.630 --> 01:49:51.253]  They won't have everybody sitting at home and it's over.
[01:49:51.253 --> 01:49:51.913]  They love it.
[01:49:51.913 --> 01:49:53.394]  COVID gives them a cashless society.
[01:49:53.394 --> 01:49:54.315]  Everybody's in debt.
[01:49:54.315 --> 01:49:55.436]  The United Nations runs it.
[01:49:55.436 --> 01:49:57.037]  It teaches us to stay in our houses.
[01:49:57.037 --> 01:49:57.817]  It's peer pressure.
[01:49:57.817 --> 01:49:59.519]  It's cult control.
[01:49:59.519 --> 01:50:00.700]  It's just on every front.
[01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:01.720]  It's a new rule to take over.
[01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:02.981]  God bless you, Charles.
[01:50:02.981 --> 01:50:07.284]  All right, listen, we got a guest in studio for at least three, four segments.
[01:50:07.284 --> 01:50:09.586]  And then if everybody's still there, I did a pretty good job.
[01:50:09.586 --> 01:50:10.566]  We got like 20 phone lines.
[01:50:10.566 --> 01:50:13.849]  So we've got Ruben's up next, then Russell.
[01:50:15.188 --> 01:50:17.231]  And then it goes right through all the other callers.
[01:50:17.231 --> 01:50:21.558]  Christine and Anonymous and Shoal and Shrimp Dog.
[01:50:21.558 --> 01:50:22.379]  Gotta go to Shrimp Dog.
[01:50:22.379 --> 01:50:25.604]  So we'll get to everybody when we start the next hour.
[01:50:25.604 --> 01:50:25.924]  Briefly.
[01:50:26.872 --> 01:50:28.413]  We have a new campaign shirt.
[01:50:28.413 --> 01:50:37.137]  I've been looking for the right shirt for 2020, and when I saw the Democrats in USA Today said that the American Eagle is Nazi, because it was standing on top of a globe that was the American flag.
[01:50:37.137 --> 01:50:38.117]  That's the Marine Corps symbol.
[01:50:38.117 --> 01:50:39.238]  It's everything else.
[01:50:39.238 --> 01:50:43.800]  Newsflash, the Nazis copied us, and we copied the Romans.
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:47.601]  But the point is, oh, look, that flag, it's Nazi.
[01:50:47.601 --> 01:50:49.122]  No, no, no, it's not.
[01:50:49.122 --> 01:50:50.603]  The Mexican flag isn't Nazi either.
[01:50:51.818 --> 01:50:53.600]  The Iraqi flag's an eagle, too.
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:54.341]  It's not.
[01:50:54.341 --> 01:50:55.982]  The Russian flag's a double-headed eagle.
[01:50:55.982 --> 01:50:57.444]  It's not Nazi, okay?
[01:50:57.444 --> 01:50:59.345]  But they want to say every symbol the left owns.
[01:50:59.345 --> 01:51:00.326]  No, you don't own this.
[01:51:00.326 --> 01:51:06.092]  Betsy Ross flag, abolitionist flag, on the breastplate, or the eagle sits on top of it.
[01:51:06.092 --> 01:51:06.993]  20 stars around it.
[01:51:06.993 --> 01:51:08.875]  Infowars.com on the back.
[01:51:08.875 --> 01:51:09.796]  Keep America Great!
[01:51:10.416 --> 01:51:12.217]  With the Betsy Ross flag on the right-hand shoulder.
[01:51:12.217 --> 01:51:14.198]  It is a gorgeous shirt.
[01:51:14.198 --> 01:51:15.538]  Two different designs.
[01:51:15.538 --> 01:51:17.139]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:51:17.139 --> 01:51:18.620]  Storewide free shipping right now.

[01:51:21.921 --> 01:51:23.702]  Two different designs.
[01:51:23.702 --> 01:51:27.023]  Guaranteed to trigger America haters.
[01:51:27.023 --> 01:51:28.584]  This is the shirt.
[01:51:28.584 --> 01:51:29.064]  Get it.
[01:51:29.064 --> 01:51:30.325]  Infowarsstore.com.

[01:51:31.765 --> 01:51:34.607]  And we have the privacy pockets that are selling out as well.
[01:51:34.607 --> 01:51:35.047]  Stay with us.
[01:51:36.716 --> 01:51:47.522]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history, that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[01:51:47.522 --> 01:51:56.728]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property, because we've had it so long, and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[01:51:57.088 --> 01:52:11.272]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Renaissance, the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[01:52:11.272 --> 01:52:25.476]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the Earth and we need to be culled and dumped down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[01:52:25.936 --> 01:52:27.619]  And that's what COVID-19 is.
[01:52:27.619 --> 01:52:34.309]  A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity, and against your future.
[01:52:34.309 --> 01:52:36.072]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[01:52:38.132 --> 01:52:39.573]  It's Christmas in July.
[01:52:39.573 --> 01:52:40.793]  We ran the sale last year.
[01:52:40.793 --> 01:52:42.554]  It was very, very popular.
[01:52:42.554 --> 01:52:48.836]  And so I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election year.
[01:52:48.836 --> 01:52:54.378]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[01:52:54.378 --> 01:53:00.001]  It's the American Eagle, boldly spreading its wings, sitting atop a Betsy Ross flag.
[01:53:00.001 --> 01:53:02.642]  And the shirts are on sale right now at infowarestore.com.
[01:53:03.782 --> 01:53:09.906]  I got the idea from the Trump campaign of having a similar sort of media called Nazi, which of course it isn't.
[01:53:09.906 --> 01:53:14.549]  And since it's so triggering to the leftists and the globalists, well, we're going to make sure there's even more of these on the streets.
[01:53:15.399 --> 01:53:17.020]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[01:53:52.998 --> 01:54:06.471]  I had to come on tonight because I want to right now lay out for the Info Warriors and the American people what will be the next phase of this outrageous attempt to destroy this country.
[01:54:06.471 --> 01:54:16.401]  The Washington Post has latched on to a left-wing conspiracy theory that has been promulgated by Howard Fineman of MSNBC.
[01:54:16.401 --> 01:54:17.322]  It goes like this.
[01:54:18.115 --> 01:54:33.632]  Roger Stone was aware of misconduct or inappropriate activity by the President of the United States, and he traded his silence in return for a commutation from the President of the United States.
[01:54:33.632 --> 01:54:37.496]  This is absolutely, totally, categorically false.
[01:54:38.069 --> 01:54:40.072]  There is no evidence of this.
[01:54:40.072 --> 01:54:50.345]  What it is is a bastardization of what I have said, which is Mueller's dirty cops pressured me extraordinarily hard to turn on the president.
[01:54:50.345 --> 01:54:53.489]  That means to offer false testimony.
[01:54:53.789 --> 01:55:00.053]  To offer composed testimony, to say things that were not true about the President.
[01:55:00.053 --> 01:55:01.975]  In other words, to lie.
[01:55:01.975 --> 01:55:07.518]  If I had been willing to lie, they dangled some unspecified leniency.
[01:55:07.518 --> 01:55:15.724]  But at no time did I ever say to anyone that I was aware of wrongdoing by the President that I would remain silent about
[01:55:16.264 --> 01:55:20.267]  In return for some unspecified leniency.
[01:55:20.267 --> 01:55:26.391]  This is the next phase of the disinformation campaign by the Deep State.
[01:55:26.391 --> 01:55:28.553]  We already saw phase one, Owen.
[01:55:28.553 --> 01:55:34.497]  That was, oh, Stone was in communication with a Russian intelligence officer.
[01:55:34.497 --> 01:55:36.158]  Well, we've been through this one before.
[01:55:36.898 --> 01:55:46.821]  I had a totally benign communication with the persona of Guccifer 2.0 on Twitter direct messages in late October.
[01:55:46.821 --> 01:55:54.923]  This conversation was, or I should say exchange, was completely disclosed by me to the American public in 2017.
[01:55:54.923 --> 01:56:04.225]  It was completely disclosed to the staff of the House Intelligence Committee based on the timing, long after WikiLeaks had already released all of their documents
[01:56:04.745 --> 01:56:06.186]  And the content.
[01:56:06.186 --> 01:56:07.567]  It is meaningless.
[01:56:07.567 --> 01:56:09.668]  It is proof of nothing.
[01:56:09.668 --> 01:56:19.413]  And the contention that Guccifer 2.0, whoever that may be, is a Russian intelligence asset, that is the opinion of John Brennan.
[01:56:19.413 --> 01:56:22.795]  That is the opinion of Robert Mumbles Mueller.
[01:56:22.795 --> 01:56:25.196]  But it has never been proven in a U.S.
[01:56:25.196 --> 01:56:26.017]  court of law.
[01:56:26.437 --> 01:56:32.386]  It's right up there with Saddam Hussein having weapons of mass destruction.
[01:56:32.386 --> 01:56:38.355]  It is right up there with them saying that Lee Harvey Oswald killed Kennedy and he acted alone.
[01:56:38.355 --> 01:56:42.661]  It is yet another piece of deep state disinformation.
[01:56:43.081 --> 01:56:47.064]  So, you heard it here first, right here, on The War Room.
[01:56:47.064 --> 01:57:01.953]  We need to repeat this tomorrow on The Alex Jones Show, because every patriot in the country needs to know, this is the next phase of the disinformation campaign by the Deep State.
[01:57:01.953 --> 01:57:05.035]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[01:57:05.035 --> 01:57:05.936]  I think, just let me think.
[01:57:05.936 --> 01:57:11.519]  In fact, even now, orders are being shouted into telephones, and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[01:57:11.519 --> 01:57:12.220]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[01:57:14.591 --> 01:57:21.174]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain their power.
[01:57:21.174 --> 01:57:24.356]  Words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen.
[01:57:26.931 --> 01:57:31.973]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[01:57:31.973 --> 01:57:33.013]  You decided, sir.
[01:57:33.013 --> 01:57:33.954]  You wanted it foolproof.
[01:57:33.954 --> 01:57:35.594]  You told me every television in London!
[01:57:35.594 --> 01:57:37.715]  Cruelty and injustice.
[01:57:37.715 --> 01:57:39.495]  Intolerance and oppression.
[01:57:39.495 --> 01:57:49.459]  And where once you had the freedom to object, to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and surveilling your submission.
[01:57:49.459 --> 01:57:50.339]  We need cameras.
[01:57:50.339 --> 01:57:51.800]  How did this happen?
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:52.540]  Who's to blame?
[01:57:53.540 --> 01:57:56.202]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[01:57:56.202 --> 01:57:58.543]  They will be held accountable.
[01:57:58.543 --> 01:58:03.986]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[01:58:05.200 --> 01:58:06.821]  I know why you did it.
[01:58:06.821 --> 01:58:08.261]  I know you were afraid.
[01:58:08.261 --> 01:58:11.042]  Who would it be?
[01:58:11.042 --> 01:58:11.122]  War?
[01:58:11.122 --> 01:58:11.302]  Terror?
[01:58:11.302 --> 01:58:12.603]  Disease?
[01:58:12.603 --> 01:58:19.025]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense.
[01:58:19.025 --> 01:58:25.427]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[01:58:25.427 --> 01:58:31.590]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[01:58:38.311 --> 01:58:40.012]  There is a war.
[01:58:40.012 --> 01:58:41.794]  It's happening now.
[01:58:41.794 --> 01:58:44.256]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[01:58:44.256 --> 01:58:45.917]  The time to choose sides has come.
[01:58:45.917 --> 01:58:49.900]  The reasons that the globalists launched this planetary lockdown.
[01:58:49.900 --> 01:58:54.083]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[01:58:54.083 --> 01:58:58.566]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[01:58:58.566 --> 01:59:04.631]  The cashless society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[01:59:04.631 --> 01:59:07.673]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are
[01:59:08.237 --> 01:59:20.862]  Obsolete that we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[01:59:20.862 --> 01:59:24.924]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[01:59:24.924 --> 01:59:30.306]  It's been pre-planned, organized globally, and it's extremely predatory.
[01:59:30.306 --> 01:59:36.649]  And through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all
[01:59:37.193 --> 01:59:42.077]  are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[01:59:42.077 --> 01:59:45.179]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[02:00:09.315 --> 02:00:11.057]  Welcome back, folks, to the third hour.
[02:00:11.057 --> 02:00:12.038]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:00:12.038 --> 02:00:15.602]  Joe Collins is running against Maxine Waters.
[02:00:16.636 --> 02:00:17.797]  Right there in California.
[02:00:17.797 --> 02:00:20.259]  We're talking about why we need to fund the police.
[02:00:20.259 --> 02:00:23.120]  Maxine Waters and liberal politicians are destroying California.
[02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:24.221]  What's going to happen to California?
[02:00:24.221 --> 02:00:27.103]  Law enforcement policies are harming the black community.
[02:00:27.103 --> 02:00:31.947]  Candace Owens has a great platform but fails to hold liberal cities responsible for crime.
[02:00:31.947 --> 02:00:32.927]  Joe is from L.A.
[02:00:32.927 --> 02:00:38.551]  and knows the hood and what it needs to improve and feels many conservatives don't see this.
[02:00:38.551 --> 02:00:43.514]  And so joining us here is Joe Collins to break all of this down.
[02:00:43.514 --> 02:00:44.455]  Good to have you here.
[02:00:44.455 --> 02:00:45.376]  Yeah, I appreciate it.
[02:00:45.967 --> 02:00:47.908]  Well, I mean, tear into it.
[02:00:47.908 --> 02:00:49.309]  What is going to happen to California?
[02:00:49.309 --> 02:00:58.135]  Because I know for a fact that not just Elon Musk has secretly moved here and bought a bunch of land that's not secret out by the airport to move Tesla.
[02:00:58.135 --> 02:00:58.955]  He's doing it.
[02:00:58.955 --> 02:01:00.817]  About a year from now, Tesla will be here.
[02:01:01.978 --> 02:01:07.223]  All the Hollywood people that are secretly conservatives or libertarians have had to play the game.
[02:01:07.223 --> 02:01:08.604]  They're all moving here.
[02:01:08.604 --> 02:01:10.786]  Chess pieces are moving in their words.
[02:01:10.786 --> 02:01:11.807]  There's a huge exodus.
[02:01:11.807 --> 02:01:17.353]  I'm talking thousands of directors, producers, major household names.
[02:01:17.353 --> 02:01:18.213]  They're all leaving.
[02:01:18.213 --> 02:01:18.694]  What's happening?
[02:01:19.039 --> 02:01:21.240]  Well, I'll tell you this, man, taxes is happening.
[02:01:21.240 --> 02:01:22.881]  Gavin Newsom is a terrible governor.
[02:01:22.881 --> 02:01:24.601]  We have terrible representation.
[02:01:24.601 --> 02:01:28.443]  And I think the biggest reason why is, you know, not not to bash on Democrats.
[02:01:28.443 --> 02:01:28.963]  OK, I'm a liar.
[02:01:28.963 --> 02:01:29.904]  I'm a bash on Democrats.
[02:01:29.904 --> 02:01:34.566]  But we have an entire Democratic conglomerate in California that is terrible at making policies.
[02:01:34.566 --> 02:01:35.086]  I mean, you look at.
[02:01:35.546 --> 02:01:35.946]  Taxes.
[02:01:35.946 --> 02:01:40.629]  We have gas tax, air tax, split road tax, payroll tax, you know, business tax.
[02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:45.672]  We have all kinds of taxes that are forcing people to move out of California to have a business.
[02:01:45.672 --> 02:01:54.276]  You know, just the homeless population is out of control right now and I don't think we have any competent legislators to do anything about these issues.
[02:01:54.276 --> 02:01:58.498]  And again, I don't see Texas as in competition with California.
[02:01:58.498 --> 02:02:00.039]  I don't see the nation working that way.
[02:02:00.039 --> 02:02:00.800]  I'm depressed.
[02:02:01.460 --> 02:02:05.545]  That a state that was redder than Texas 30, 40 years ago is now like this.
[02:02:05.545 --> 02:02:07.126]  California is a beautiful state.
[02:02:07.126 --> 02:02:07.927]  It's amazing.
[02:02:07.927 --> 02:02:10.710]  I mean, if California wasn't communist, I'd probably live there.
[02:02:10.710 --> 02:02:11.792]  Nothing against Texas.
[02:02:11.792 --> 02:02:12.653]  It's got better weather.
[02:02:12.653 --> 02:02:13.734]  What happened to it?
[02:02:13.734 --> 02:02:16.577]  Because it's not just the taxes.
[02:02:16.577 --> 02:02:18.119]  There's just something spiritual about it.
[02:02:18.439 --> 02:02:19.479]  Yeah, you know what?
[02:02:19.479 --> 02:02:22.481]  California used to be a beautiful state, but it's not anymore.
[02:02:22.481 --> 02:02:30.003]  I mean, we have Governor Newsom, and I'm gonna tell you, this guy, he reminds me of the Joker from Batman.
[02:02:30.003 --> 02:02:34.385]  And, you know, he just, he's planning on releasing 18,000 convicted fellas from prison.
[02:02:34.385 --> 02:02:37.446]  He does look like the American Psycho.
[02:02:37.446 --> 02:02:41.027]  He does, and I think that... I mean, would you trust that guy?
[02:02:41.027 --> 02:02:42.488]  He just screams, I'm a criminal.
[02:02:42.848 --> 02:02:47.992]  I would trust Gas Station Sushi more than I trust Gavin Newsom and the Democratic in California.
[02:02:47.992 --> 02:02:52.074]  But it seems like he's trying to recreate Gotham City in California.
[02:02:52.074 --> 02:02:53.075]  It's not going to work.
[02:02:53.075 --> 02:02:56.637]  I think the people are waiting for someone like me to run for office.
[02:02:56.637 --> 02:02:57.858]  No nonsense, no games.
[02:02:57.858 --> 02:02:58.499]  Let's get back to business.
[02:02:58.499 --> 02:03:03.122]  By the way, I don't think people know, because they haven't been out there, there's homeless in neighborhoods.
[02:03:03.122 --> 02:03:04.743]  No matter where the hell are they coming from?
[02:03:05.123 --> 02:03:05.844]  You know what?
[02:03:05.844 --> 02:03:08.366]  Gavin Newsom forced these people out of their homes.
[02:03:08.366 --> 02:03:10.447]  These people are losing their homes.
[02:03:10.447 --> 02:03:16.693]  We have a mental illness problem in California, but we also have a poor job problem.
[02:03:16.693 --> 02:03:19.815]  We also have a poor economic development problem.
[02:03:19.815 --> 02:03:22.918]  We also have a poor legislator's problem.
[02:03:22.918 --> 02:03:24.859]  And people are getting moved out of their homes.
[02:03:24.859 --> 02:03:25.920]  They can't afford to live.
[02:03:25.920 --> 02:03:26.641]  So they're on the streets.
[02:03:26.641 --> 02:03:27.902]  We have homeless children.
[02:03:27.902 --> 02:03:30.063]  We have entire families living on the streets.
[02:03:30.063 --> 02:03:31.725]  Is it fair to say the state's collapsed?
[02:03:32.668 --> 02:03:33.688]  Not yet.
[02:03:33.688 --> 02:03:34.869]  Not yet, but we're close.
[02:03:34.869 --> 02:03:35.329]  We're getting there.
[02:03:35.329 --> 02:03:36.749]  What would a collapse look like?
[02:03:36.749 --> 02:03:39.610]  I think a collapse would look like Venezuela.
[02:03:39.610 --> 02:03:42.090]  We're close to Venezuela.
[02:03:42.090 --> 02:03:44.311]  I agree with you.
[02:03:44.311 --> 02:03:47.692]  Why do the Democrats seem to accelerate the thing that's doing it then?
[02:03:47.692 --> 02:03:59.014]  I think that because they were elected into office and they have been comfortable without doing anything for a very long time, people have been comfortable not getting anything for a long time.
[02:03:59.014 --> 02:03:59.855]  And so you have a
[02:04:02.188 --> 02:04:03.309]  I totally agree with you.
[02:04:03.309 --> 02:04:05.290]  I think you have the perfect form of arrogant entitled politicians
[02:04:25.883 --> 02:04:30.986]  And a corrupt media that backs him, and then they think they can manipulate the public with psychology, but it's not working anymore.
[02:04:30.986 --> 02:04:31.947]  It's not, it's not.
[02:04:31.947 --> 02:04:41.133]  Even with these face masks, I mean, a billion dollar deal to China, where the Chinese virus came from, and then turn around and say, hey, we got to force everybody to wear masks.
[02:04:41.133 --> 02:04:43.034]  I mean, like, what type of leadership is that?
[02:04:45.930 --> 02:04:49.512]  So do you think the Democrats are delusional, or do you think they have an in-game strategy?
[02:04:49.512 --> 02:04:56.095]  I think the Democrats are so out of touch with what's going on today, they have no strategy at all.
[02:04:56.095 --> 02:05:00.317]  And now they're just, you know, shooting from the hip, as we like to call it in the military.
[02:05:00.317 --> 02:05:05.239]  How do you beat, and I should go over your bio here, we'll do that next segment, how do you beat Maxine Waters?
[02:05:05.239 --> 02:05:10.322]  I mean, just running is just great, she can get on the stage and expose her, but I mean, let's talk about this lady.
[02:05:10.322 --> 02:05:12.623]  Does she believe the BS that comes out of her mouth?
[02:05:13.143 --> 02:05:16.525]  You know what, I don't even think she knows the BS that comes out of her mouth.
[02:05:16.525 --> 02:05:18.446]  I think Maxine Waters is so delusional.
[02:05:18.446 --> 02:05:25.749]  She's been doing the same thing since the 70s when she was elected into the Assembly and she tried to push the same thing in the 90s and it worked.
[02:05:25.749 --> 02:05:28.751]  But now, you know, you're dealing with a different type of person.
[02:05:28.751 --> 02:05:33.573]  You're dealing with Millennials right now who do not care about anything anybody says.
[02:05:33.573 --> 02:05:34.253]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:05:34.253 --> 02:05:37.275]  The only thing the Millennials need are all these guys that are protesting.
[02:05:37.275 --> 02:05:41.477]  All they need is a real leader to direct that anger in a more positive manner.
[02:05:42.517 --> 02:05:46.641]  Well, I found that if you just talk straight to millennials, they wake up and the generation Z's.
[02:05:46.641 --> 02:05:48.122]  This is true.
[02:05:48.122 --> 02:05:49.484]  The media claims they've got control of them.
[02:05:49.484 --> 02:05:50.344]  I don't think that's the case.
[02:05:50.344 --> 02:05:52.006]  It's just that nobody's actually talked to them straight.
[02:05:52.006 --> 02:05:52.446]  They don't.
[02:05:52.446 --> 02:05:54.869]  I mean, look at the amount of statues they're breaking down.
[02:05:54.869 --> 02:05:56.150]  They're pulling all these statues down.
[02:05:56.150 --> 02:05:58.412]  They think they're going to erase history.
[02:05:58.412 --> 02:06:01.895]  And I don't think that's the goal of these millennials.
[02:06:01.895 --> 02:06:02.976]  I think they want to be heard.
[02:06:02.976 --> 02:06:06.019]  I think they want a leader who is going to guide them in the right direction.
[02:06:06.019 --> 02:06:07.701]  I mean, you talk about police reform.
[02:06:08.061 --> 02:06:12.845]  Police reform have absolutely nothing to do with police brutality or police violence, which are two different things.
[02:06:12.845 --> 02:06:18.849]  Police reform is simply looking at the laws that could be used to target people in inner cities.
[02:06:18.849 --> 02:06:22.412]  We blame the police when it's the legislature, it's the laws.
[02:06:22.412 --> 02:06:25.294]  Exactly, and I've been preaching the same exact thing.
[02:06:25.294 --> 02:06:29.737]  We went to Minneapolis a couple of days after George Floyd died, and I told them, I said,
[02:06:30.518 --> 02:06:33.580]  You guys are upset at the police, but the police are not the problem.
[02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:36.441]  The problem is the laws that have been put in place, i.e.
[02:06:36.441 --> 02:06:38.262]  the 94 Crime Bill, Three Strikes Law.
[02:06:38.262 --> 02:06:42.824]  These laws that the cops have to use to target people in inner cities.
[02:06:42.824 --> 02:06:44.525]  It's like a blueprint for a car.
[02:06:44.525 --> 02:06:47.226]  You don't yell at the guy on the assembly line putting a car together.
[02:06:47.226 --> 02:06:50.108]  If there's an issue, it's the blueprint, it's the engineers.
[02:06:50.108 --> 02:06:50.768]  Exactly.
[02:06:50.768 --> 02:06:52.249]  It's not the guy welding it.
[02:06:52.469 --> 02:06:52.569]  Yeah.
[02:06:52.569 --> 02:06:55.370]  And you're saying it's the cops' fault when they're just implementing what they've been told to do.
[02:06:55.370 --> 02:06:55.850]  Exactly.
[02:06:55.850 --> 02:07:08.792]  You know what, and I support the police department, and I feel like the legislators in California and across the world, I mean like look at Chicago, New York, these legislators are such cowards that they cannot take responsibility for things that they have been told.
[02:07:08.792 --> 02:07:09.732]  And they're scapegoating the police.
[02:07:09.732 --> 02:07:13.113]  For me, it's not about kissing the police ass, it's that they're not the ones doing this.
[02:07:13.113 --> 02:07:17.494]  So to scapegoat a few bad things police do and say as a group they're all to blame?
[02:07:17.494 --> 02:07:17.734]  Exactly.
[02:07:17.734 --> 02:07:20.595]  I don't want to be blamed for what a group does that I'm blamed?
[02:07:20.595 --> 02:07:20.995]  Exactly.
[02:07:22.575 --> 02:07:28.496]  And so they say in the military we had a phrase that, you know, one eff up will take away a thousand attaboys.
[02:07:28.496 --> 02:07:33.638]  Well, when you have one eff up in a police department, why does it have to make the whole entire police department look bad?
[02:07:33.638 --> 02:07:39.419]  How come we can't implement programs or legislations that target bad cops and get them out?
[02:07:39.419 --> 02:07:40.879]  Well, that's what individualism is all about.
[02:07:40.879 --> 02:07:42.800]  That's what Martin Luther King said over and over again.
[02:07:42.800 --> 02:07:44.260]  You don't judge people off of
[02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:46.122]  The group, you judge them off them.
[02:07:46.122 --> 02:07:46.442]  Exactly.
[02:07:46.442 --> 02:07:47.263]  There's a reason for that.
[02:07:47.263 --> 02:07:48.364]  Exactly.
[02:07:48.364 --> 02:07:59.616]  And when we stand with the police department, I support the police department, I support the president backing up the police department, and I think that these mayors and governors who want the federal help out of their states, I think they should be ashamed of themselves.
[02:08:00.217 --> 02:08:03.161]  Well, I think they're just idiots that are going off the media coverage.
[02:08:03.161 --> 02:08:04.042]  You said it, not me.
[02:08:04.042 --> 02:08:08.567]  But they don't get that almost no one respects what mainstream media says.
[02:08:08.567 --> 02:08:14.895]  Just because the news endorses a police chief that badmouths their officers, the public doesn't buy that.
[02:08:14.895 --> 02:08:15.395]  That's true.
[02:08:15.395 --> 02:08:19.120]  What's wrong with these politicians, though, that they still think mainstream media is king?
[02:08:19.460 --> 02:08:23.225]  They're trying to retain that spot in office, and they have nothing to run off of.
[02:08:23.225 --> 02:08:29.233]  I mean, like, what type of economic development have been made through Los Angeles, Chicago, New York?
[02:08:29.233 --> 02:08:34.900]  I mean, AOC, she's the newest representative, and she, she, I mean, she made... She ran off Amazon.
[02:08:35.100 --> 02:08:35.660]  Right?
[02:08:35.660 --> 02:08:38.361]  And she said that, oh, they're probably still in bed.
[02:08:38.361 --> 02:08:43.403]  Well, when I look at New York, people are actually getting shot in the streets, and not because of bread.
[02:08:43.403 --> 02:08:45.763]  It's because they don't have crime prevention.
[02:08:45.763 --> 02:08:47.104]  They got rid of the police department.
[02:08:47.104 --> 02:08:49.225]  You got Bill de Blasio, who's a straight coward.
[02:08:49.225 --> 02:08:50.865]  You know, you got Cuomo, who's a coward.
[02:08:50.865 --> 02:08:53.446]  And criminals now know they can kill somebody and get away with it.
[02:08:53.446 --> 02:08:53.886]  Absolutely.
[02:08:53.886 --> 02:08:55.367]  I got some people I'm thinking about.
[02:08:55.367 --> 02:08:55.807]  Because, look.
[02:08:55.807 --> 02:08:58.848]  Yeah, this breakdown goes much further.
[02:08:58.848 --> 02:09:02.409]  It's almost like we have the Purge coming back to the United States.
[02:09:03.089 --> 02:09:04.732]  Well how far does that go though?
[02:09:04.732 --> 02:09:08.299]  Because if the left starts a purge, don't they get there's going to be another one?
[02:09:08.299 --> 02:09:08.840]  You know what?
[02:09:08.840 --> 02:09:11.845]  The left will never start a purge and the reason why is because they're anti-2A.
[02:09:12.952 --> 02:09:13.212]  Right?
[02:09:13.212 --> 02:09:19.635]  So, if you're anti-two-way, that means you don't support the Second Amendment, which means you don't have guns, which means if you don't have guns, you don't know how to use guns.
[02:09:19.635 --> 02:09:20.655]  Who know how to use guns?
[02:09:20.655 --> 02:09:25.337]  Conservatives and people who've been in the military, and they're not predominantly liberal or Democrat.
[02:09:25.337 --> 02:09:27.658]  So, they're going to be out of luck.
[02:09:27.658 --> 02:09:29.539]  I'll say this, though, and it's a silver lining to all this.
[02:09:29.539 --> 02:09:31.199]  We'll come back and talk about it more with the man running.
[02:09:31.199 --> 02:09:32.860]  It's Maxine Waters of California.
[02:09:32.860 --> 02:09:33.440]  Joe Collins.
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:35.041]  I'll tell you his website, how you can get involved with him.
[02:09:36.189 --> 02:09:40.480]  This has made America come closer together, I think, and really made us all grow up.
[02:09:40.480 --> 02:09:42.164]  In fact, the left's thrown this giant temper tantrum.
[02:09:42.164 --> 02:09:42.725]  We'll be right back.
[02:09:42.725 --> 02:09:43.126]  Stay with us.
[02:09:44.485 --> 02:09:47.267]  We close and lock our doors and windows at night.
[02:09:47.267 --> 02:09:50.808]  Not because we're doing anything wrong, but because it's about privacy.
[02:09:50.808 --> 02:09:52.209]  And it's about security.
[02:09:52.209 --> 02:09:55.411]  And it's something that we do to protect ourselves.
[02:09:55.411 --> 02:10:02.495]  Going back thousands of years, when we would post a dog or a sentry at the entrance of the village, so we would know if predators or criminals were coming.
[02:10:02.495 --> 02:10:10.119]  Well, big tech, along with the federal government and other globalist organizations, have been tracking everybody illegally for years with their cell phones.
[02:10:10.499 --> 02:10:15.523]  But now, the public is finally waking up because the enemy has openly announced it's the fact.
[02:10:15.523 --> 02:10:21.368]  And the Clinton Foundation Global Initiative with Chelsea is running the private system to spy on you and your family.
[02:10:21.368 --> 02:10:26.952]  That's right, the Democrats, the globalists, the Chaikovs, they've all got our number, they're tracking us in Lifetime.
[02:10:26.952 --> 02:10:36.120]  But with Privacy Pockets, the best system, at InfoWarsTore.com, you can protect yourself and your family by keeping your cell phone inside of the little pouch.

[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:32.761]  People should really support him.
[02:12:32.761 --> 02:12:34.301]  He's a veteran, a patriot.
[02:12:34.301 --> 02:12:35.962]  You know, Joe, I should have done this up front.
[02:12:35.962 --> 02:12:36.502]  You're a U.S.
[02:12:36.502 --> 02:12:38.103]  Navy veteran, South Central L.A.
[02:12:38.103 --> 02:12:39.544]  native, congressional candidate.
[02:12:39.544 --> 02:12:42.345]  Tell the viewers and listeners a little bit about yourself and what got you in the race.
[02:12:42.665 --> 02:12:47.568]  Man, so yeah, I'm from South Central Los Angeles, back before they called it South LA.
[02:12:47.568 --> 02:12:51.530]  And, you know, I grew up there, born and raised.
[02:12:51.530 --> 02:12:55.832]  My house was shot up in a drive-by, actually, right when I got into high school.
[02:12:55.832 --> 02:12:57.193]  I was a freshman.
[02:12:57.193 --> 02:12:58.354]  My mom moved up to Texas.
[02:12:58.354 --> 02:13:04.017]  I joined the Navy right out of high school and served 13 and a half years.
[02:13:04.017 --> 02:13:06.158]  And I got out the military to get involved in politics.
[02:13:06.838 --> 02:13:16.702]  And, uh, it was kind of like a, it was a situation to where, you know, if you've been in the military, you know that, um, if you were, if you're, if you're serving, you can't get involved in politics.
[02:13:16.702 --> 02:13:16.942]  Right?
[02:13:16.942 --> 02:13:19.664]  And so I became a presidential candidate and then I got out the military.
[02:13:19.664 --> 02:13:26.026]  I got an option to, uh, stay in the military and drop out of politics or pursue politics and get out the military.
[02:13:26.026 --> 02:13:28.547]  After 13 and a half years, I've done pretty good.
[02:13:28.547 --> 02:13:31.609]  I was actually one of the best jet engine mechanics the Navy had.
[02:13:31.609 --> 02:13:33.810]  I chose to get out and, um,
[02:13:34.830 --> 02:13:36.050]  So that's just a natural thing to do?
[02:14:04.440 --> 02:14:05.741]  Quality jobs, where is it?
[02:14:05.741 --> 02:14:09.383]  By the way, she's got all these multi-million dollar houses outside the district.
[02:14:09.383 --> 02:14:11.264]  She sends money to her husband's bank.
[02:14:11.264 --> 02:14:13.445]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:14:13.445 --> 02:14:22.771]  I know back in the days, in the 90s, she used to get the bills or she used to get different projects and give them to her husband so he could make money when he was a government contractor.
[02:14:22.771 --> 02:14:26.213]  Then he became a stockholder in a bank and then she got bailed out.
[02:14:26.213 --> 02:14:28.374]  Pelosi knows that too, with her husband.
[02:14:28.374 --> 02:14:30.195]  She's a whole different ballgame.
[02:14:30.195 --> 02:14:31.756]  She's a whole different ballgame.
[02:14:31.756 --> 02:14:33.577]  She basically runs the governor, doesn't she, Pelosi?
[02:14:33.937 --> 02:14:34.919]  Yeah, that's her nephew.
[02:14:34.919 --> 02:14:37.645]  So she has to, you know, he's a puppet.
[02:14:37.645 --> 02:14:39.088]  Who's worse, Pelosi or Waters?
[02:14:39.088 --> 02:14:40.572]  I think it's probably Pelosi.
[02:14:40.572 --> 02:14:42.075]  I'm close.
[02:14:42.075 --> 02:14:43.257]  I'm from South Central Los Angeles.
[02:14:43.257 --> 02:14:44.059]  I'm going to say it's Waters.
[02:14:45.022 --> 02:14:45.242]  Yeah.
[02:14:45.242 --> 02:14:47.623]  But Pelosi, she's a devil in herself.
[02:14:47.623 --> 02:14:50.883]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:14:50.883 --> 02:14:57.465]  But hopefully next 2022 cycle we have some great candidates running against her and I'm going to throw my support behind them and do what we have to do in order to get them in office.
[02:14:57.465 --> 02:14:59.925]  Is she scared when we're ever going to get into debates with her?
[02:14:59.925 --> 02:15:02.366]  Have you had a chance to confront her yet?
[02:15:02.366 --> 02:15:04.086]  Listen, Maxine Waters is not going to debate me.
[02:15:04.086 --> 02:15:06.047]  The reason why is because when I got out of the military,
[02:15:06.707 --> 02:15:10.710]  I was homeless, you know, trying to get my VA benefits to go through.
[02:15:10.710 --> 02:15:16.213]  I mean, we have a lot of homeless veterans in the military, and I found out I had a broken back in two different places.
[02:15:16.213 --> 02:15:16.774]  Wow.
[02:15:16.774 --> 02:15:18.995]  And I was waiting and waiting and waiting.
[02:15:18.995 --> 02:15:20.316]  Three months I spent homeless.
[02:15:20.316 --> 02:15:22.937]  I went to her office every other day for the internships.
[02:15:22.937 --> 02:15:24.478]  I took her flowers just to get her attention.
[02:15:24.478 --> 02:15:25.239]  Oh, that's incredible.
[02:15:25.239 --> 02:15:25.819]  I didn't know this.
[02:15:25.819 --> 02:15:30.102]  So you're literally trying to get your military benefits, going to her office with your back broke.
[02:15:30.502 --> 02:15:41.985]  Look, I went so far as to try and sue the military because I thought that the reason that I wasn't getting my benefits was because I got an Administrative Separation, General and Honorable Conditions.
[02:15:41.985 --> 02:15:48.327]  I didn't know the VA process was so broken, but she is, as a representative, her first obligation is to veterans.
[02:15:48.327 --> 02:15:49.987]  And she absolutely failed.
[02:15:49.987 --> 02:15:51.127]  Did she respond to you?
[02:15:51.127 --> 02:15:51.868]  No, she did not.
[02:15:51.868 --> 02:15:53.108]  That's why I'm running against her.
[02:15:53.108 --> 02:15:55.849]  Because when I used to walk around... Well, that's a personal story, though.
[02:15:55.849 --> 02:15:56.149]  It is.
[02:15:57.509 --> 02:15:59.269]  Yeah, I don't tell it because I don't want sympathy.
[02:15:59.269 --> 02:15:59.970]  I don't need sympathy.
[02:15:59.970 --> 02:16:02.470]  It's not sympathy, but people need to know the personal reason.
[02:16:02.470 --> 02:16:03.130]  Yeah.
[02:16:03.130 --> 02:16:04.411]  That's powerful.
[02:16:04.411 --> 02:16:06.551]  So when you go around South L.A.
[02:16:06.551 --> 02:16:11.993]  and you look at the amount of veterans that we have in South Central Los Angeles, the majority of the homeless are veterans.
[02:16:11.993 --> 02:16:17.614]  I mean, I was sleeping at the Pia Ranchos Palos Verdes at the lighthouse near Trump Golf Course.
[02:16:17.614 --> 02:16:20.535]  And Trump Golf Course is the only people that treat him with respect.
[02:16:21.223 --> 02:16:21.803]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:16:21.803 --> 02:16:29.447]  They gave me food, and when my benefits finally came through, I got my condo, and I was like, you know what?
[02:16:29.447 --> 02:16:31.588]  This is never going to happen to any other veteran in Los Angeles.
[02:16:31.588 --> 02:16:35.630]  Do you think the numbers went from like 30% approval to 87% approval?
[02:16:35.630 --> 02:16:36.811]  Trump's trying.
[02:16:36.811 --> 02:16:37.651]  He's fired a lot of people.
[02:16:37.651 --> 02:16:40.212]  Have you heard from veterans that it's a little bit better to be here?
[02:16:40.212 --> 02:16:40.772]  You know what?
[02:16:40.772 --> 02:16:43.634]  He did pass a law for veterans, and so it is.
[02:16:43.634 --> 02:16:44.854]  You have a choice now.
[02:16:44.854 --> 02:16:45.395]  Be honest about it.
[02:16:45.395 --> 02:16:46.255]  Has it gotten better?
[02:16:46.255 --> 02:16:47.236]  Yeah, absolutely.
[02:16:47.236 --> 02:16:49.857]  Because you can take your veteran's benefits and go to a private doctor now.
[02:16:50.117 --> 02:16:51.338]  So that puts competition in the air.
[02:16:51.338 --> 02:16:55.942]  But a lot of people don't know that because we're in a liberal state and they want to do their best to make President Trump look bad.
[02:16:55.942 --> 02:17:02.367]  I mean, they don't know about criminal justice reform, they don't know about opportunity zones, they don't know about veterans' choice, they don't know about permanent funding at HBCU.
[02:17:02.367 --> 02:17:08.171]  When you look at what Trump's really done as a populist, I wouldn't call it conservative, I mean, he's done an incredible job.
[02:17:08.171 --> 02:17:10.053]  But this is things that he's been- He's actually dizzying.
[02:17:10.453 --> 02:17:12.635]  He's been doing this his whole life.
[02:17:12.635 --> 02:17:16.840]  Ever since he took over his father's business, his whole goal is to create opportunities for minorities.
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:19.342]  I mean, like, go to any Trump property, who do you see there?
[02:17:19.342 --> 02:17:25.108]  You see black people, you see Hispanics, you see people from out of town, you see everybody, even white people, everybody's working at Trump property.
[02:17:27.009 --> 02:17:27.970]  Exactly.
[02:17:27.970 --> 02:17:33.631]  So now, you know, when you hear people say, oh, he's a racist, this, he's a racist, that, and you say, well, prove it.
[02:17:33.631 --> 02:17:35.912]  By the way, that's true about the Trump Hotel.
[02:17:35.912 --> 02:17:42.613]  I never said this on air because I don't want to be, like you said, catty about it, but the bartenders are black, the waitresses, the maitre d's, the managers.
[02:17:42.613 --> 02:17:44.814]  I was like, wow, this is like a black run hotel.
[02:17:44.814 --> 02:17:45.594]  All minorities.
[02:17:45.594 --> 02:17:47.495]  And they're like paid more than other hotels.
[02:17:47.495 --> 02:17:51.416]  And that's every single hotel across the country, even overseas, because I've been to ones overseas.
[02:17:52.145 --> 02:17:55.128]  This is, this is, this is, this is this man.
[02:17:55.128 --> 02:18:00.612]  And then when people, so when people call the president racist, I'm like, well, where, where is he racist at?
[02:18:00.612 --> 02:18:01.273]  How is he racist?
[02:18:01.273 --> 02:18:07.158]  Why do you think Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson, who said he was the best white man for black people for 30 years, now they say he's bad?
[02:18:07.338 --> 02:18:09.960]  Listen, I don't care what Alex Sharpton or Jesse Jackson say.
[02:18:09.960 --> 02:18:14.483]  You talk about men who have made hundreds of millions of dollars off the black community, off the black struggle.
[02:18:14.483 --> 02:18:15.664]  I don't trust Jesse Jackson.
[02:18:15.664 --> 02:18:16.684]  I don't trust Alex Sharpton.
[02:18:16.684 --> 02:18:17.585]  They're both snakes.
[02:18:17.585 --> 02:18:19.326]  They're like the building fund on the church.
[02:18:19.326 --> 02:18:21.888]  You give them all this money because you expect them to do something.
[02:18:21.888 --> 02:18:23.449]  They don't even put a doorknob on the church.
[02:18:23.449 --> 02:18:24.350]  I don't trust these guys.
[02:18:26.138 --> 02:18:26.778]  No, I agree with you.
[02:18:26.778 --> 02:18:27.379]  That's the fact.
[02:18:27.379 --> 02:18:29.500]  So, who are the real black leaders that you know?
[02:18:29.500 --> 02:18:30.681]  Who do you like?
[02:18:30.681 --> 02:18:31.861]  I'm a real black leader.
[02:18:31.861 --> 02:18:34.283]  People who are running for office right now are real black leaders.
[02:18:34.283 --> 02:18:40.346]  You know, we have tons and tons of black leaders regardless of whether, you know, we agree with their rhetoric or not.
[02:18:40.346 --> 02:18:42.928]  We have black leaders in their own rights.
[02:18:42.928 --> 02:18:45.029]  You see that private jet he's on?
[02:18:45.029 --> 02:18:46.230]  I've looked at the price.
[02:18:46.230 --> 02:18:51.613]  One trip just across the U.S., $100,000 each way that jet he was getting on.
[02:18:51.613 --> 02:18:53.514]  He's done pretty good for himself and I respect that.
[02:18:54.619 --> 02:18:58.583]  Yeah, like you said though, representing, it's just crazy.
[02:18:58.583 --> 02:18:59.705]  Absolutely.
[02:18:59.705 --> 02:19:02.848]  Look, he's even wearing gloves.
[02:19:02.848 --> 02:19:04.170]  Like he's Michael Jackson.
[02:19:04.170 --> 02:19:06.813]  Yeah, but I mean like how many people has he ever flown on that jet?
[02:19:06.813 --> 02:19:09.035]  Because he looks out for himself, I'm going to tell you.
[02:19:09.035 --> 02:19:15.783]  I've seen him come to the inner cities and he stirs up drama and he collects his check and he leaves.
[02:19:16.581 --> 02:19:22.023]  You know, I don't have nothing in common with, you know, Al Sharpton aside for our skin color.
[02:19:22.023 --> 02:19:23.423]  He doesn't resonate with me.
[02:19:23.423 --> 02:19:30.165]  He resonates with older black people who are comfortable with him, to be honest with you.
[02:19:30.165 --> 02:19:39.988]  No disrespect, but that's- What do you think about the numbers of upwards of 30% of black men supporting Trump versus usually 10% Republican presidential candidate?
[02:19:39.988 --> 02:19:43.669]  Hey, I think more people need to support President Trump because- You think those numbers are accurate, 30%?
[02:19:46.294 --> 02:19:46.914]  I think there's more.
[02:19:46.914 --> 02:19:49.795]  I know in California we have a lot of... I think it's even higher.
[02:19:49.795 --> 02:19:50.736]  I would assume it's higher.
[02:19:50.736 --> 02:19:53.116]  You have a lot of quiet conservatives in California.
[02:19:53.116 --> 02:19:57.778]  I have people... You know, we opened up our office right in the middle of South Central Los Angeles, and I did it for a reason.
[02:19:57.778 --> 02:20:03.100]  I wanted to show people that you don't have to be scared to be a Republican or a conservative in South Los Angeles.
[02:20:03.100 --> 02:20:05.421]  I mean, like, not be scared.
[02:20:05.421 --> 02:20:06.021]  Let's do it.
[02:20:06.021 --> 02:20:07.281]  You know, we can all work together.
[02:20:07.281 --> 02:20:09.162]  I got your back, you have my back.
[02:20:09.162 --> 02:20:11.583]  And so... Well, it's about ideology, not skin color, like you said.
[02:20:12.503 --> 02:20:23.747]  Yeah, you know, a lot of people think that the Republican Party is for white people, and I can understand that because being a black Republican, I take a lot of heat from white Republicans who've been Republicans who they think longer than I have.
[02:20:23.747 --> 02:20:27.028]  I've been a Republican since, you know, 2004 when I joined the military, but
[02:20:27.836 --> 02:20:38.279]  At the end of the day, I mean, you cannot preach your mainstream Republican message to liberals, black people, and predominantly Democratic dissidents who've been Democrat for their whole life.
[02:20:38.279 --> 02:20:39.580]  Let's talk about it when we come back.
[02:20:39.580 --> 02:20:41.880]  Is Trump going to win if the election was held tomorrow?
[02:20:41.880 --> 02:20:42.801]  Stay with us.
[02:20:42.801 --> 02:20:47.662]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.

[02:21:43.130 --> 02:21:44.351]  We are selling more.
[02:21:47.585 --> 02:21:58.960]  We were previously selling in a month because of the Clinton Foundation running the contact tracing and admittedly with Google and Apple tracking all Americans on their phones even if you opt out of it or get rid of the apps.
[02:21:58.960 --> 02:22:05.309]  People realize these criminal groups are surveilling you and selling your data and using it to control your life.
[02:22:05.849 --> 02:22:13.616]  Sharing it with Antifa, sharing it with Black Lives Matter, sharing it with the deep state to oppress not just high-profile people, but the general public.
[02:22:13.616 --> 02:22:25.286]  That's why folks are taking back control of their lives with these little Faraday cages that you can put your cell phones in that knock out the ability of the cell towers to ping it every few seconds and track your location.
[02:22:25.546 --> 02:22:31.091]  This is the only way to have your privacy, and people are taking their privacy back, and it's very, very exciting.
[02:22:31.091 --> 02:22:34.855]  They're at $19.95 apiece at mfullworthstore.com.
[02:22:34.855 --> 02:22:35.956]  We've ordered even more.
[02:22:35.956 --> 02:22:41.221]  A huge shipment's coming in next week, so get yours now and be part of the movement to cut Big Brother off.
[02:22:42.785 --> 02:22:49.409]  Much of the United States bureaucracy, all of Hollywood, and most of our media is under international banking control.
[02:22:49.409 --> 02:22:54.692]  The United Nations was set up by the Rothschilds and Rockefellers on record to carry out this operation.
[02:22:54.692 --> 02:22:59.735]  Now, under the guise of medical security, they're bringing us medical tyranny.
[02:23:00.575 --> 02:23:12.965]  That we see much of the federal government, the Democrats, the Republicans, all saying, except for Trump and a few people, that we need a nationwide force mask mandate to make everyone wear a mask.
[02:23:12.965 --> 02:23:17.669]  Even though just months ago we had the Surgeon General and others say, don't wear a mask, it's all a fraud.
[02:23:17.669 --> 02:23:18.810]  Now they say you must
[02:23:19.230 --> 02:23:20.170]  Wear a mask.
[02:23:20.170 --> 02:23:21.271]  It's a sign of slavery.
[02:23:21.271 --> 02:23:22.852]  It's a sign of submission.
[02:23:22.852 --> 02:23:24.292]  I know you as listeners understand that.
[02:23:24.292 --> 02:23:36.077]  We need sheriffs and county commissioners and city councils and others to stand up and say we are sanctuary cities for reality and for state and local sovereignty against the globalists.
[02:23:36.077 --> 02:23:37.697]  This isn't the federal government taking over.
[02:23:37.697 --> 02:23:45.521]  It's the UN through the federal government and we as American citizens must say no.
[02:23:45.521 --> 02:23:48.342]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:23:57.752 --> 02:24:17.213]  Coming down fast, but a miles above you.
[02:24:20.526 --> 02:24:22.028]  Alright, Joe Collins is our guest.
[02:24:22.028 --> 02:24:22.769]  He's running.
[02:24:22.769 --> 02:24:24.892]  He's a naval veteran, patriot.
[02:24:24.892 --> 02:24:26.494]  He's running against Maxine Waters.
[02:24:26.494 --> 02:24:28.977]  And I should add, he's in the lead in many polls.
[02:24:28.977 --> 02:24:32.342]  He's the top Republican candidate and ahead of her in many polls.
[02:24:32.342 --> 02:24:34.865]  You should tell folks up front, that's very exciting.
[02:24:34.865 --> 02:24:35.366]  Yeah, we are.
[02:24:35.366 --> 02:24:35.987]  We are.
[02:24:38.154 --> 02:24:38.794]  We're good to go.
[02:24:58.166 --> 02:24:59.407]  Get yourself in front of people.
[02:24:59.407 --> 02:25:01.869]  They want the young, fresh, smart, conservative.
[02:25:01.869 --> 02:25:03.089]  Yeah, you know what?
[02:25:03.089 --> 02:25:08.253]  The biggest thing is that, for one, Maxine Waters does not help anybody in the community.
[02:25:08.253 --> 02:25:09.034]  Nobody.
[02:25:09.034 --> 02:25:12.076]  Unless she can get her pockets fat, she's not helping anybody.
[02:25:12.076 --> 02:25:15.598]  And two, my grandfather was a pastor.
[02:25:15.598 --> 02:25:19.821]  And he had the biggest church, the biggest black church before megachurches was a thing.
[02:25:19.821 --> 02:25:23.724]  And so people know me from when I was a little boy, like Los Angeles, South Los Angeles is my community.
[02:25:23.724 --> 02:25:24.565]  This is where I grew up.
[02:25:24.565 --> 02:25:25.205]  This is where I was
[02:25:25.565 --> 02:25:26.626]  So they know you're a homeboy?
[02:25:44.818 --> 02:25:50.482]  Exactly, because why should you have communists like AOC and others taking it away from Democrat scumbags?
[02:25:50.482 --> 02:25:54.905]  We need real patriot Americans to be taken over from the Democrats.
[02:25:54.905 --> 02:25:56.246]  Listen, AOC is an idiot.
[02:25:56.246 --> 02:25:58.947]  And I don't even know how she made it into office.
[02:25:58.947 --> 02:26:00.689]  I mean, you know, you think about it.
[02:26:00.689 --> 02:26:01.849]  She is an idiot.
[02:26:01.849 --> 02:26:03.470]  She got on her Instagram.
[02:26:04.611 --> 02:26:07.352]  And she botched the three branches of government.
[02:26:07.352 --> 02:26:08.072]  Like, who does that?
[02:26:08.072 --> 02:26:09.373]  You are in Congress.
[02:26:09.373 --> 02:26:10.593]  Like, you should know these things.
[02:26:10.593 --> 02:26:13.794]  If you're in Congress and you're a freshman and you don't know... I forgot about that.
[02:26:13.794 --> 02:26:15.255]  You should be studying.
[02:26:15.255 --> 02:26:19.656]  And then to turn around and say that the crime in New York was because of bread.
[02:26:19.656 --> 02:26:20.997]  People can't pay their bills, they're bread.
[02:26:20.997 --> 02:26:27.879]  Don't you know they have a law that you can't get evicted from your apartment or your house... Meanwhile, this Democrat shut the economy off.
[02:26:27.879 --> 02:26:28.320]  Exactly.
[02:26:28.320 --> 02:26:28.900]  That's what they do.
[02:26:29.960 --> 02:26:38.502]  Because of COVID-19 that has a 99% recovery rate and only a 0.07 death rate.
[02:26:38.502 --> 02:26:40.203]  I think it's absolutely ridiculous.
[02:26:40.203 --> 02:26:43.003]  So people should visit JoeCollinsForCongress.com.
[02:26:43.003 --> 02:26:44.164]  They should share it.
[02:26:44.164 --> 02:26:45.704]  People bitch about Maxine Waters.
[02:26:45.704 --> 02:26:47.264]  They bitch about these evil people.
[02:26:47.264 --> 02:26:48.385]  Well, then take action.
[02:26:48.385 --> 02:26:50.405]  Your word of mouth is king, listeners.
[02:26:50.405 --> 02:26:52.766]  If you promote this young man, I say young.
[02:26:52.766 --> 02:26:53.586]  Hell, we all get old quick.
[02:26:53.586 --> 02:26:55.546]  We've been in the Navy 13, 14 years.
[02:26:55.546 --> 02:26:56.667]  I mean, we're all getting old here.
[02:26:56.667 --> 02:26:58.207]  The point is, it's time to fight.
[02:26:58.447 --> 02:27:01.069]  You're young compared to Maxine Waters, I'll put it that way.
[02:27:01.069 --> 02:27:05.272]  Look, I'm young compared to a lot of politicians that are in office right now, and they all need to go.
[02:27:05.272 --> 02:27:08.794]  I mean, California's the worst.
[02:27:08.794 --> 02:27:10.776]  Man, I get scared watching California.
[02:27:10.776 --> 02:27:20.422]  You realize, literally, without even trying to know Hollywood people, almost everybody I know in Hollywood is moving to Austin.
[02:27:20.422 --> 02:27:21.243]  It's ridiculous.
[02:27:21.243 --> 02:27:23.244]  I mean, I don't want to name names, but it's ridiculous.
[02:27:23.244 --> 02:27:24.966]  And they're turning Texas purple.
[02:27:25.646 --> 02:27:29.510]  Well that's the weird thing is they come here and then they keep doing the same thing they did before.
[02:27:29.510 --> 02:27:30.271]  Exactly.
[02:27:30.271 --> 02:27:35.496]  And I tell people all the time the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and over again expecting different results.
[02:27:35.496 --> 02:27:41.363]  So if you leave in California because the policy, the liberal policies are killing your state, why would you bring that to a new state?
[02:27:41.363 --> 02:27:46.348]  Why don't you just adapt to the culture in that state and live well?
[02:27:46.348 --> 02:27:48.010]  Well the general person moving here
[02:27:50.379 --> 02:27:51.801]  You're right, doesn't get the politics.
[02:27:51.801 --> 02:27:56.386]  But I can tell you, the directors, the producers, the big talk show hosts.
[02:27:56.386 --> 02:28:00.552]  I mean, it's no secret Joe Rogan's moving to Austin, though I'm not supposed to say it.
[02:28:00.552 --> 02:28:03.315]  But I mean, it's not just Elon Musk, it's all of them.
[02:28:03.315 --> 02:28:07.300]  They're already driving the housing prices way up right now, because they're already here.
[02:28:07.620 --> 02:28:08.641]  Yeah, sure.
[02:28:08.641 --> 02:28:10.784]  And they say everybody they know is leaving.
[02:28:10.784 --> 02:28:15.188]  What happened in the last year, the lockdown, that just made everybody finally just go boom?
[02:28:15.188 --> 02:28:16.269]  It was more than a lockdown.
[02:28:16.269 --> 02:28:22.016]  I think that what happened was these people voted all these Democrats into office thinking that they had their best interests in mind.
[02:28:22.016 --> 02:28:22.877]  But lo and behold...
[02:28:23.357 --> 02:28:28.260]  You see, the evidence is that the Democrats care about illegal immigration.
[02:28:28.260 --> 02:28:29.801]  California is a sanctuary state.
[02:28:29.801 --> 02:28:31.162]  They care about illegal immigration.
[02:28:31.162 --> 02:28:34.644]  California gave $150 million to illegal immigrants.
[02:28:34.644 --> 02:28:36.465]  They care about illegal immigrants.
[02:28:36.465 --> 02:28:39.686]  They gave another $75 million to illegal immigrants.
[02:28:39.686 --> 02:28:42.728]  They care about illegal immigrants because they gave housing to illegal immigrants.
[02:28:42.728 --> 02:28:45.910]  And they care about felons because they're about to let 18,000 prisoners out of jail.
[02:28:48.072 --> 02:28:49.093]  For them, it's the vote.
[02:28:49.093 --> 02:28:51.354]  It's not they don't care about people from other countries.
[02:28:51.354 --> 02:28:53.796]  It's the endgame of conquering territory.
[02:28:53.796 --> 02:28:57.638]  Like when Hitler invented Europe, he was blowing up everything because he wanted control of it.
[02:28:57.638 --> 02:28:58.699]  Like, why are you blowing it up?
[02:28:58.699 --> 02:28:59.540]  I'm conquering it.
[02:28:59.540 --> 02:29:00.120]  That's what they're doing.
[02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:01.621]  They're conquering everything.
[02:29:01.621 --> 02:29:02.442]  They think they are.
[02:29:02.442 --> 02:29:03.682]  But let me tell you this.
[02:29:03.682 --> 02:29:14.930]  There is not one Latino, not one Mexican, not one Hispanic that's going to vote for any Democrat, because everybody in California, regardless if you identify with the Democratic Party or not, they all have conservative values.
[02:29:14.930 --> 02:29:17.492]  I was about to say, yeah, for family and stuff.
[02:29:17.492 --> 02:29:17.912]  Exactly.
[02:29:18.392 --> 02:29:18.953]  Exactly.
[02:29:18.953 --> 02:29:23.656]  Family... I gotta say, most of the Hispanics I talk to that aren't even from the United States, they don't like the Democrats.
[02:29:23.656 --> 02:29:28.320]  They know, and they'll tell you right up front, we just came from a communist state, why are you guys trying to be communists?
[02:29:28.320 --> 02:29:30.342]  It didn't work for us, it's not gonna work for you.
[02:29:30.342 --> 02:29:32.203]  Trust me, we know.
[02:29:32.203 --> 02:29:34.165]  So there's a major miscalculation.
[02:29:34.165 --> 02:29:37.868]  Why do you think people's dead cats are getting voter registrations in the mail?
[02:29:38.886 --> 02:29:39.827]  Oh, you know what?
[02:29:39.827 --> 02:29:41.969]  That's just terrible leadership.
[02:29:41.969 --> 02:29:42.630]  And it shows.
[02:29:42.630 --> 02:29:44.752]  Well, they're scraping all the names, the Democrats are.
[02:29:44.752 --> 02:29:45.373]  They're trying to.
[02:29:45.373 --> 02:29:48.436]  I mean, you got dead cats and dead people getting voter registrations, too.
[02:29:48.436 --> 02:29:54.063]  But that's just a part of the whole voter fraud scheme they have going on in California.
[02:29:54.063 --> 02:29:55.184]  What about police, though?
[02:29:55.184 --> 02:29:55.684]  Because again...
[02:29:56.707 --> 02:30:20.066]  I mean, look, anybody getting killed by bad cops is bad, and there are bad cops, and that's terrible, but like 15 black men on average every year get killed wrongfully by police on average, that's wrong, but millions get killed in abortion, and you've got the Democratic Party literally making their whole platform on killer cops, and then when the cops don't go into the neighborhoods because they're scared to get in trouble, doesn't that cause the thousands of dead?
[02:30:20.686 --> 02:30:27.790]  I'll tell you what Candace Owens said, and I agree with Candace Owens on some things and I don't agree with her on other things, but she said this perfectly.
[02:30:27.790 --> 02:30:31.192]  She said, it's so easy to get black people wrapped up in their emotions.
[02:30:31.192 --> 02:30:32.672]  Black people are so emotional.
[02:30:32.672 --> 02:30:35.194]  So if you have a lot of Democrats... Well, everybody is.
[02:30:35.194 --> 02:30:35.674]  Well, yeah.
[02:30:35.854 --> 02:30:44.082]  Well, if you have a lot of Democrats that are pushing this narrative that black people are getting killed by the cops, it will get you emotional and you will get upset.
[02:30:44.082 --> 02:30:46.905]  And this is what happens when people get in your emotions.
[02:30:46.905 --> 02:30:48.427]  Statistics don't lie, do they?
[02:30:48.427 --> 02:30:50.248]  Stats don't lie.
[02:30:50.248 --> 02:30:58.437]  But I think one thing that people do miscalculate is the police violence and police brutality, which are two totally different things.
[02:30:58.877 --> 02:31:01.079]  Right, so we have a lot of police brutality in Los Angeles.
[02:31:01.079 --> 02:31:07.706]  Well, isn't it also, if you're dressed like you or your campaign manager looks like black James Bond over here, people are opening doors for you when you're dressed like that.
[02:31:07.706 --> 02:31:14.993]  But if you're dressed like a thug, white or black, if I had my drawers hanging down in a chain and I'm white or black, the cops are going to mess with me because I'm dressed like a gangbanger.
[02:31:14.993 --> 02:31:15.593]  Isn't it how you act?
[02:31:17.894 --> 02:31:20.175]  I got the thing they call, you fake it until you make it.
[02:31:20.175 --> 02:31:23.777]  When I wanted to be successful, I started putting on suits, and then eventually I became successful.
[02:31:23.777 --> 02:31:29.939]  But you can't tell black people, hey, you need to stop dressing like a gang member, or you're going to keep getting messed with by the cops, because they don't want to hear that.
[02:31:29.939 --> 02:31:34.381]  They think that, oh, well, we should be able to do what we want to, and look how we want to, and nothing should happen.
[02:31:34.381 --> 02:31:35.882]  But, I mean, come on.
[02:31:35.882 --> 02:31:36.682]  You cannot lie.
[02:31:36.682 --> 02:31:42.925]  I would lock my doors if somebody came by with their pants sagging and dressed like a thug, too, because I value my things.
[02:31:42.925 --> 02:31:43.585]  Well, that's the thing.
[02:31:43.585 --> 02:31:46.487]  Most people want to wear the Crips or the Blood uniform.
[02:31:47.327 --> 02:31:49.349]  Just to act like they're tough, but that's a uniform.
[02:32:04.964 --> 02:32:09.067]  Uh, women and men to try to live the same exact lifestyle that they see on TV.
[02:32:09.067 --> 02:32:10.768]  And this stuff is not real.
[02:32:10.768 --> 02:32:12.089]  And I cannot stress this enough.
[02:32:12.089 --> 02:32:14.771]  The drama you see on TV is all written down drama.
[02:32:14.771 --> 02:32:15.531]  It's about his face.
[02:32:15.531 --> 02:32:18.273]  Oh, all those, all those reality shows are fake.
[02:32:18.273 --> 02:32:18.833]  Exactly.
[02:32:18.833 --> 02:32:19.394]  It's not real.
[02:32:19.394 --> 02:32:24.217]  But people want to imitate this stuff on a regular basis in a black community because they say, oh, this is black culture.
[02:32:24.217 --> 02:32:25.257]  This is black culture.
[02:32:25.257 --> 02:32:26.338]  That's not black culture.
[02:32:26.338 --> 02:32:27.559]  No, that's Hollywood saying that.
[02:32:27.699 --> 02:32:32.545]  If you go back in history and you look at every single black culture, what do we have going in black culture?
[02:32:32.545 --> 02:32:35.388]  We have suits, we have businesses, we have families.
[02:32:35.388 --> 02:32:36.550]  What don't we have right now?
[02:32:36.550 --> 02:32:37.711]  Suits, businesses, and families.
[02:32:37.711 --> 02:32:39.053]  And what is the result of that?
[02:32:39.053 --> 02:32:45.881]  Black men going to jail on a regular basis, a black man being at the home, little boys growing up in single family homes, and now we have a catastrophe.
[02:32:45.981 --> 02:32:49.302]  No, you're absolutely right, and that's what people always got.
[02:32:49.302 --> 02:32:52.143]  You had to have your own businesses and your own thing, and now they've taken that away.
[02:32:52.143 --> 02:32:57.665]  And we have to get back to that, and that's why I tell my campaign team, I said, look, we're not going to look like everybody in the community.
[02:32:57.665 --> 02:32:59.165]  When we go out, we wear suits.
[02:32:59.165 --> 02:33:00.626]  And now what do the big banks want?
[02:33:00.626 --> 02:33:02.467]  They want all Americans not to have their own businesses.
[02:33:02.467 --> 02:33:03.407]  Exactly.
[02:33:03.407 --> 02:33:04.987]  Well, at least in California.
[02:33:04.987 --> 02:33:07.608]  Gavin Newsom doesn't want anybody to have a business except for him.
[02:33:07.608 --> 02:33:09.969]  You know, when he shut down the state, and this is ridiculous.
[02:33:09.969 --> 02:33:11.029]  He kept his wineries open.
[02:33:11.029 --> 02:33:12.250]  He kept his wineries open.
[02:33:12.830 --> 02:33:17.752]  And listen, Maxine Waters is a representative and she's supposed to be so pro-black and she's supposed to love our community.
[02:33:17.752 --> 02:33:19.172]  They call her Auntie Maxine.
[02:33:19.172 --> 02:33:19.532]  For what?
[02:33:19.532 --> 02:33:21.433]  I have no idea because she leaves everybody hanging.
[02:33:21.433 --> 02:33:22.774]  My auntie never left me hanging.
[02:33:22.774 --> 02:33:24.474]  But why didn't she say nothing to Gavin Newsom?
[02:33:24.474 --> 02:33:26.535]  Like, hey, why is your winery open?
[02:33:26.535 --> 02:33:27.795]  Everything else is closed down.
[02:33:27.795 --> 02:33:28.796]  Shut your stuff down, too.
[02:33:28.796 --> 02:33:30.116]  But no, she didn't do that.
[02:33:30.116 --> 02:33:31.117]  You know?
[02:33:31.117 --> 02:33:32.997]  And she doesn't support the police department.
[02:33:32.997 --> 02:33:38.059]  It's the arrogance, though, to keep all his five wineries open, but all the other wineries were shut down.
[02:33:38.059 --> 02:33:39.440]  I mean, that is so criminal.
[02:33:39.440 --> 02:33:40.060]  We'll be right back.
[02:33:40.060 --> 02:33:40.460]  Stay with us.
[02:33:42.486 --> 02:33:50.608]  As men age, they often experience a slowdown in vitality, energy, and overall wellness.
[02:33:51.963 --> 02:33:56.704]  And that's why we made one of our most popular formulas to date.

[02:35:35.528 --> 02:35:42.734]  That's Survival Shield X2 Spray at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:35:42.734 --> 02:35:47.939]  There are a lot of reasons to get an Alex Jones plastic mask at InfoWarStore.com.
[02:35:47.939 --> 02:35:51.141]  You can wear them out to political events, you can trigger lib darts.
[02:35:51.141 --> 02:35:56.606]  But one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or
[02:35:57.344 --> 02:35:58.404]  At Halloween.
[02:35:58.404 --> 02:36:04.647]  But on top of that, they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to protect you from COVID-19 or anything else.
[02:36:04.647 --> 02:36:11.249]  It's total virtue signaling to show that you're prepared for the forced inoculations and contact tracing that they're openly announcing.
[02:36:11.249 --> 02:36:13.050]  It's an act of submission.
[02:36:13.050 --> 02:36:16.471]  It's an act of like putting a burka on your head and bowing down.
[02:36:16.471 --> 02:36:21.353]  But a big reason to wear these is then into stores when people ask you why you're wearing a Halloween mask, say,
[02:36:21.812 --> 02:36:26.214]  It's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing.
[02:36:26.214 --> 02:36:30.016]  And the M95 mask only controls what's coming in, not what's going out.
[02:36:30.016 --> 02:36:32.097]  So they quote, spread COVID-19.
[02:36:32.097 --> 02:36:33.597]  They don't protect from it.
[02:36:33.597 --> 02:36:36.539]  So again, it's a great way to throw it back at these control freaks' faces.
[02:36:36.539 --> 02:36:39.200]  You buy one for $9.95, you get four more free.
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:40.200]  They're at cost.
[02:36:40.200 --> 02:36:41.541]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:36:42.386 --> 02:36:45.368]  I know what we'll do to make them conform to our cult.
[02:36:45.368 --> 02:36:53.953]  We'll all tell them to wear masks or they're gonna die, and then we'll release the pressure for a while, then bring it back and squeeze it harder, and release it again, and we'll be the Virtue Singers.
[02:36:53.953 --> 02:36:59.256]  We'll be the angels, even though our Lord and Master Bill Gates helped fund the whole COVID-19.
[02:36:59.256 --> 02:36:59.416]  Oh!
[02:36:59.416 --> 02:36:59.636]  No!
[02:36:59.636 --> 02:37:03.139]  Don't Sadookie me!
[02:37:03.979 --> 02:37:05.120]  That's right.
[02:37:05.120 --> 02:37:13.888]  That's the code word for Bill Gates' operation he carries out with his good little buddy, Dr. Fauci, in the surgeon cult.
[02:37:13.888 --> 02:37:19.593]  As you know, for girls, there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance novels.
[02:37:19.593 --> 02:37:22.436]  One of them's the vampire, the werewolf,
[02:37:23.176 --> 02:37:26.259]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:37:55.056 --> 02:38:00.430]  Live, raw and unfiltered by globalist propaganda.
[02:38:00.430 --> 02:38:02.034]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:38:09.832 --> 02:38:12.574]  Hi, Navy veteran Joe Collins running against Maxine Waters.
[02:38:12.574 --> 02:38:13.675]  Fun talking to him here today.
[02:38:13.675 --> 02:38:17.757]  You can find out more at jocollinsforcongress.com.
[02:38:17.757 --> 02:38:29.844]  But getting into Elijah Cummings and all the crazy stuff he did, you know, when he would sit there and say, how dare Trump put children in cages and they're in these diapers, and he was showing four-year-old stuff from when he was under Obama.
[02:38:29.844 --> 02:38:30.865]  And I wouldn't even blame Obama.
[02:38:30.865 --> 02:38:31.445]  What's he doing?
[02:38:31.445 --> 02:38:32.646]  Millions are coming across the border.
[02:38:33.373 --> 02:38:36.496]  But just, and then you said you saw him right before he died?
[02:38:36.496 --> 02:38:38.698]  Yeah, I saw him like two weeks before he died.
[02:38:38.698 --> 02:38:47.165]  He was actually having a lunch to, I guess, like rebut everything that President Trump was saying.
[02:38:47.165 --> 02:38:49.627]  And I'm going to tell you that when I saw him, he was pathetic.
[02:38:49.627 --> 02:38:51.029]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[02:38:51.029 --> 02:38:56.454]  And that's not to, you know, take away from his death, you know, rest his soul wherever, you know, God may have him.
[02:38:57.074 --> 02:39:04.020]  But, um, you know, I have people like, yo, you need to go talk trash to him because, you know, President gave him $17 billion and the money disappeared.
[02:39:04.020 --> 02:39:08.343]  There has been no economic development in his district or anything.
[02:39:08.343 --> 02:39:11.205]  When I saw him in a wheelchair, I was like, I ain't gonna talk to this man.
[02:39:11.205 --> 02:39:12.446]  You know what I'm saying?
[02:39:12.446 --> 02:39:16.710]  This guy right here that I saw, he was in a wheelchair and it's ordered to pee his shoes on.
[02:39:16.710 --> 02:39:18.952]  You know, he had three or four people to help him get up.
[02:39:18.952 --> 02:39:19.772]  I'm like, nah, that's not worth it.
[02:39:19.772 --> 02:39:21.814]  Obviously, there was a group behind him controlling this.
[02:39:21.814 --> 02:39:24.156]  Oh yeah, oh yeah, yes, absolutely was.
[02:39:24.156 --> 02:39:24.836]  Absolutely was.
[02:39:25.757 --> 02:39:27.278]  And then, you know, he gave a speech.
[02:39:27.278 --> 02:39:28.578]  I sat there and I watched his speech.
[02:39:28.578 --> 02:39:31.219]  It was the most racist thing I've ever heard in my whole life.
[02:39:31.219 --> 02:39:37.942]  And they always talk about white people being racist, but there are a lot of black people in a republic, in a democratic party, that are absolutely racist.
[02:39:37.942 --> 02:39:42.443]  Well, the media has made it legitimate, and they encourage it to create division.
[02:39:42.443 --> 02:39:52.747]  Well, you talk about MSNBC, CNN, and all these other mainstream media who uses reporters to tell the story.
[02:39:52.747 --> 02:39:54.008]  Now, last time I checked,
[02:39:54.628 --> 02:39:59.556]  The reporters were never the greed to tell facts.
[02:39:59.556 --> 02:40:01.038]  They were only the greed to tell opinions.
[02:40:01.038 --> 02:40:04.003]  So I'll take the reporter's opinion like I watch a movie.
[02:40:04.003 --> 02:40:04.263]  99% is BS.
[02:40:04.263 --> 02:40:04.484]  0.1% is true.
[02:40:07.742 --> 02:40:10.983]  Exactly, and now they tell us reporters have fact in their establishment.
[02:40:10.983 --> 02:40:11.643]  I doubt it.
[02:40:11.643 --> 02:40:12.664]  I doubt it.
[02:40:12.664 --> 02:40:16.165]  Establishment or not, there is no reporter who has any type of facts.
[02:40:16.165 --> 02:40:17.285]  It's all opinions.
[02:40:17.285 --> 02:40:23.547]  The thing about it is they tell you their opinions over and over and over again, and then all of a sudden you start to take on their opinion as if it's your own.
[02:40:23.547 --> 02:40:26.548]  What would you do if you got elected to Congress to replace Maxine Waters?
[02:40:26.548 --> 02:40:27.049]  It could happen.
[02:40:27.049 --> 02:40:28.209]  People get excited.
[02:40:28.209 --> 02:40:30.370]  What would you do day one?
[02:40:30.370 --> 02:40:30.850]  Day one?
[02:40:31.790 --> 02:40:32.891]  I'm going to take a nap.
[02:40:32.891 --> 02:40:34.011]  I'm going to tell you that.
[02:40:34.011 --> 02:40:36.112]  Because this honestly... Exactly.
[02:40:36.112 --> 02:40:37.233]  You just won the campaign.
[02:40:37.233 --> 02:40:38.694]  You're going to take a couple days off.
[02:40:38.694 --> 02:40:39.454]  No, just one day.
[02:40:39.454 --> 02:40:39.674]  One day.
[02:40:39.674 --> 02:40:40.375]  I'm a workaholic.
[02:40:40.375 --> 02:40:42.696]  I was in the military, you know, 13 and a half years.
[02:40:42.696 --> 02:40:43.436]  All I know is work.
[02:40:43.436 --> 02:40:46.198]  So I'll take the first day I'll go to sleep.
[02:40:46.198 --> 02:40:47.798]  I'll wake up that night and it's time to get to work.
[02:40:47.798 --> 02:40:49.839]  I mean, we need economic development in our district.
[02:40:49.839 --> 02:40:50.840]  We need quality jobs.
[02:40:50.840 --> 02:40:52.821]  We need to improve our education system.
[02:40:52.821 --> 02:40:54.722]  I think that... By the way, Trump's ready to deliver that.
[02:40:54.722 --> 02:40:55.602]  Oh yeah, absolutely.
[02:40:55.602 --> 02:40:56.503]  And I support
[02:40:57.043 --> 02:41:00.304]  Everything that he wants to do for our community.
[02:41:00.304 --> 02:41:04.446]  And I tell people like this, you know, regardless Democrat or Republican, I was trained in the military.
[02:41:04.446 --> 02:41:08.347]  You support the President of the United States regardless of whatever political party he is.
[02:41:08.347 --> 02:41:10.708]  That's why the Democrats are so upset.
[02:41:10.708 --> 02:41:12.628]  They know the China deal was a one-sided deal.
[02:41:12.628 --> 02:41:14.349]  All Trump's got is flip a switch.
[02:41:14.349 --> 02:41:15.649]  Everybody gets a better deal.
[02:41:15.649 --> 02:41:17.330]  Trump wants to be the guy that turned it around.
[02:41:17.330 --> 02:41:18.910]  He wants to deliver.
[02:41:18.910 --> 02:41:21.651]  I mean, can you imagine if they get out of his way, what would happen?
[02:41:21.651 --> 02:41:26.073]  They already had a major turnaround until they pulled this cover crap.
[02:41:26.633 --> 02:41:31.815]  Yeah, China was only good for Joe Biden and his family, and Nance Pelosi and their family, and John Kerry and his family.
[02:41:31.815 --> 02:41:39.478]  Because one thing that they all have in common is they have sons or daughter-in-laws or son-in-laws that work at these companies.
[02:41:39.478 --> 02:41:40.899]  You know, look at Burisma.
[02:41:40.899 --> 02:41:43.180]  And they say, oh, he's trying to attack a political opponent.
[02:41:43.180 --> 02:41:46.601]  Well, first of all, Joe Biden wasn't even guaranteed to make an attack on a political opponent.
[02:41:46.781 --> 02:41:49.543]  You know what, it wouldn't matter if he was a political opponent or not.
[02:41:49.543 --> 02:41:53.746]  He was never guaranteed to make it into the general election.
[02:41:53.746 --> 02:41:56.107]  I mean, this guy is completely losing his mind.
[02:41:56.107 --> 02:41:56.948]  That's my next question.
[02:41:56.948 --> 02:41:58.149]  Clearly he's a placeholder.
[02:41:58.149 --> 02:42:04.733]  They're going to have a virtual campaign event, a virtual Democrat convention.
[02:42:04.733 --> 02:42:06.374]  What do you hear about the poll?
[02:42:06.374 --> 02:42:12.038]  You know what, I cannot even tell you, but I know what we've been seeing lately is going to be some more BS.
[02:42:14.121 --> 02:42:17.522]  Well the word is they've got Hillary running again with Obama as her VP.
[02:42:17.522 --> 02:42:19.962]  They claim constitutionally he can do that.
[02:42:19.962 --> 02:42:23.143]  Obama, constitutionally Obama cannot run for VP.
[02:42:23.143 --> 02:42:30.905]  The reason why, because the constitution specifically says that in order to be VP Kennedy you have to be eligible to run for president or to be a president.
[02:42:30.905 --> 02:42:34.946]  No, I agree with you, but the Hill's claiming, the media's already claiming they can do it.
[02:42:34.946 --> 02:42:36.606]  And if we won't let it, they'll claim it's racist.
[02:42:37.226 --> 02:42:40.748]  That's the misinformation that the media, mainstream media, has been telling everybody.
[02:42:40.748 --> 02:42:44.850]  They have everybody hyped up, thinking that this thing... Look, if... I'm impressed you even know the Constitution on that.
[02:42:44.850 --> 02:42:46.531]  I had to go look that up myself.
[02:42:46.531 --> 02:42:48.271]  Look, I love the Constitution.
[02:42:48.271 --> 02:42:49.552]  I fight for the Constitution.
[02:42:49.552 --> 02:42:53.094]  I fight for everybody's constitutional rights, regardless if you're Democrat or Republican.
[02:42:53.094 --> 02:42:55.315]  But I'll tell you this, Hillary Clinton's about to be going to jail.
[02:42:57.159 --> 02:42:58.399]  Is that what you heard?
[02:42:58.399 --> 02:42:59.380]  That's what I know.
[02:42:59.380 --> 02:43:00.340]  I mean, look at the evidence.
[02:43:00.340 --> 02:43:01.620]  The evidence speaks for itself.
[02:43:01.620 --> 02:43:03.861]  Like, Hillary Clinton, all this pedophilia.
[02:43:03.861 --> 02:43:06.902]  You know, Jeffrey Epstein.
[02:43:06.902 --> 02:43:08.622]  The other woman who just got arrested.
[02:43:08.622 --> 02:43:09.302]  She's telling.
[02:43:09.302 --> 02:43:14.424]  What do you make of these Hollywood stars that hang out with Epstein bragging how they like little girls?
[02:43:14.964 --> 02:43:17.445]  What the hell is that?
[02:43:17.445 --> 02:43:20.046]  I love five-year-old girls, says whatever her name is.
[02:43:20.046 --> 02:43:22.367]  I mean, why would you be talking like that?
[02:43:22.367 --> 02:43:27.008]  Listen, you don't have that stuff in Texas because we have open carry laws in Texas.
[02:43:27.008 --> 02:43:30.410]  They support their women, they support their military, they support their families.
[02:43:30.410 --> 02:43:31.670]  We don't have that in California.
[02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:32.850]  You can't have guns in California.
[02:43:32.850 --> 02:43:34.331]  It's not an open carry state.
[02:43:34.331 --> 02:43:38.292]  If we had open carry state in California, you wouldn't have pedophilia in California.
[02:43:38.292 --> 02:43:41.393]  Because people in Texas, you mess with our kids, we'll shoot you.
[02:43:41.393 --> 02:43:42.854]  You mess with our families, we'll shoot you.
[02:43:43.374 --> 02:43:48.940]  And that's exactly what we need, open carry in California so we can protect our families from pedophiles.
[02:43:48.940 --> 02:43:49.620]  That's beautiful!
[02:43:49.620 --> 02:43:52.664]  We need open carry in California to protect ourselves from pedophilia.
[02:43:52.664 --> 02:43:54.085]  That ought to be your campaign slogan.
[02:43:54.085 --> 02:43:59.350]  Look, if Gavin Newsom is going to release 18,000 prisoners, felons, convicted murderers...
[02:44:00.131 --> 02:44:01.752]  Sex offenders, out of prison?
[02:44:01.752 --> 02:44:02.972]  We absolutely need an open case.
[02:44:02.972 --> 02:44:08.234]  Well that's the thing about the left, they go abolish the police, open the prisons, but you can't have a gun.
[02:44:08.234 --> 02:44:10.434]  You know what I mean, what planet is that?
[02:44:10.434 --> 02:44:14.075]  They're getting rid of the police in the inner cities.
[02:44:14.075 --> 02:44:17.136]  They're getting rid of the police in the inner cities where we need the most help.
[02:44:17.136 --> 02:44:18.517]  Which is going to cause mass death.
[02:44:18.517 --> 02:44:18.997]  Right?
[02:44:18.997 --> 02:44:21.138]  Because what happens, you get rid of the police.
[02:44:21.138 --> 02:44:23.759]  So what is the point of that?
[02:44:23.759 --> 02:44:24.899]  You know what?
[02:44:24.899 --> 02:44:25.699]  I can't even fathom why.
[02:44:28.393 --> 02:44:40.736]  You know, because we have gang violence already, domestic violence already, alcohol-related abuse already, pedophilia already, and we have the cartel already, and this is just the inner city with the police.
[02:44:40.736 --> 02:44:41.417]  So that's it, though.
[02:44:41.417 --> 02:44:44.978]  That's why Nancy Pelosi called MS-13 God's Children.
[02:44:44.978 --> 02:44:46.178]  They just want to turn it over to that.
[02:44:46.764 --> 02:44:49.147]  What they want to do is they want to keep people dependent on the government.
[02:44:49.147 --> 02:44:51.249]  They want people to beg to the Democratic Party.
[02:44:51.249 --> 02:44:52.490]  Oh, please help us.
[02:44:52.490 --> 02:44:53.171]  Help us so much.
[02:44:53.171 --> 02:44:55.574]  We need your help, Democratic Party.
[02:44:55.574 --> 02:45:00.800]  And if you look at the history of the Democratic Party, they have never done anything to benefit anyone.
[02:45:00.800 --> 02:45:01.200]  Anyone.
[02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:02.121]  I gotta be honest with you.
[02:45:02.121 --> 02:45:03.002]  I'm ashamed.
[02:45:03.883 --> 02:45:06.724]  I love America, but I'm ashamed the Democratic Party is part of America.
[02:45:06.724 --> 02:45:09.684]  I mean, when you study them, they are so damn evil.
[02:45:09.684 --> 02:45:11.245]  It's like, who is this group?
[02:45:11.245 --> 02:45:13.385]  They are the evil side of America.
[02:45:13.385 --> 02:45:14.845]  Well, they're trying to erase history.
[02:45:14.845 --> 02:45:16.386]  They're pulling down statues.
[02:45:16.386 --> 02:45:18.766]  They're trying to rewrite history.
[02:45:18.766 --> 02:45:20.887]  Why don't you go ahead and erase the Democratic Party, too?
[02:45:20.887 --> 02:45:23.807]  Just move straight off, clear off the face of the earth.
[02:45:23.807 --> 02:45:27.688]  Back in the days, they used to say, you know, if you go too far, you'll fall off the earth.
[02:45:28.615 --> 02:45:31.118]  Take the Democratic Party and just push them right off the earth.
[02:45:31.118 --> 02:45:31.879]  We don't need them anymore.
[02:45:31.879 --> 02:45:34.963]  All we need is conservatives, Republicans, and people who want to do the right thing.
[02:45:34.963 --> 02:45:36.445]  I think they know that they're done.
[02:45:36.445 --> 02:45:37.747]  That's why they're doing all this.
[02:45:37.747 --> 02:45:39.048]  They're trying to.
[02:45:39.048 --> 02:45:39.789]  But you know what?
[02:45:39.789 --> 02:45:43.574]  That's why I'm very excited that we have a lot of great candidates that are running for office.
[02:45:43.574 --> 02:45:46.638]  A lot of great Republican, conservative candidates running for office in California.
[02:45:46.698 --> 02:45:50.563]  I don't agree with the Democrat numbers, because they know there's a big red wave coming.
[02:45:50.563 --> 02:45:53.347]  I wouldn't even call Republican, just populist.
[02:45:53.347 --> 02:45:54.488]  And I'm excited for what you're doing.
[02:45:54.488 --> 02:45:56.571]  Joe Collins, JoeCollins4Congress.com.
[02:45:56.571 --> 02:45:57.572]  We've got two minutes left.
[02:45:57.572 --> 02:45:58.013]  We've got a break.
[02:45:58.013 --> 02:46:02.098]  I'm going to come back and take some calls and finish up with our next guest host who's joining us.
[02:46:02.098 --> 02:46:03.400]  But what else do you want to impart to the viewers?
[02:46:03.720 --> 02:46:05.181]  Look, this is what I want to tell you.
[02:46:05.181 --> 02:46:05.882]  We said this earlier.
[02:46:05.882 --> 02:46:11.405]  The definition of insanity is doing the exact same thing over and over and over, expecting a different result.
[02:46:11.405 --> 02:46:17.830]  Voting for Democrats, voting for people who want to allow the police to be dismantled, has not been working for anybody.
[02:46:17.830 --> 02:46:19.431]  It's time for us to vote for somebody new.
[02:46:19.431 --> 02:46:21.713]  Doesn't matter if they're Democrat, doesn't matter if they're Republican.
[02:46:22.233 --> 02:46:24.834]  Vote someone new into office.
[02:46:24.834 --> 02:46:29.055]  Someone who's going to support our president, take those programs, and improve your cities.
[02:46:29.055 --> 02:46:32.897]  We gotta stop calling people racist just because of our own personal ideology.
[02:46:32.897 --> 02:46:39.099]  Let's look into the past, let's look into what these people are doing for us, and if it's not working for you, vote somebody else into office.
[02:46:39.099 --> 02:46:41.019]  You only got two years, vote them out, vote somebody else.
[02:46:41.019 --> 02:46:43.480]  That's all I'm saying.
[02:46:43.480 --> 02:46:44.580]  We need turnover.
[02:46:44.580 --> 02:46:46.241]  We need turnover and term limits.
[02:46:47.861 --> 02:46:52.344]  Looking at Maxine Waters and Pelosi, they're both going so insane.
[02:46:52.344 --> 02:46:57.087]  I hope you win, but there's also kind of an entertainment value to it, but it's scary.
[02:46:57.087 --> 02:47:01.150]  There is absolutely an entertainment value, especially somebody like Maxine Waters.
[02:47:01.150 --> 02:47:02.330]  I mean, I hear her all the time.
[02:47:02.330 --> 02:47:03.711]  Peace 45!
[02:47:03.711 --> 02:47:05.532]  Peace 45!
[02:47:05.532 --> 02:47:06.493]  Nobody's trying to hear that.
[02:47:06.493 --> 02:47:07.674]  Nobody's trying to hear that anymore.
[02:47:07.674 --> 02:47:12.017]  What are we doing to provide opportunities, economic development to our communities?
[02:47:12.017 --> 02:47:13.237]  So what are you getting on the street?
[02:47:13.237 --> 02:47:15.159]  You're saying you see a red wave.
[02:47:15.982 --> 02:47:21.225]  Look, I know for myself, for my campaign, we're polling at 69% right now.
[02:47:21.225 --> 02:47:22.486]  I'm in a Democratic district.
[02:47:22.486 --> 02:47:24.828]  They say it's 54-plus.
[02:47:24.828 --> 02:47:26.909]  Doesn't matter to me.
[02:47:26.909 --> 02:47:27.990]  People love me.
[02:47:27.990 --> 02:47:29.010]  People love me in my district.
[02:47:29.010 --> 02:47:31.292]  We're winning, but we need the support from the entire country.
[02:47:32.256 --> 02:47:34.076]  So when you're able to get in front of people, you win.
[02:47:34.076 --> 02:47:35.837]  The question is, can you get in front of them?
[02:47:35.837 --> 02:47:36.837]  That's what we're doing right now.
[02:47:36.837 --> 02:47:41.438]  I mean, we have our food drives going three or four times a week in different areas of the district.
[02:47:41.438 --> 02:47:43.218]  We have programs.
[02:47:43.218 --> 02:47:45.759]  We have NASA that we're putting back into our high schools.
[02:47:45.759 --> 02:47:54.421]  We're working with the aviation community to try to provide journeymen and apprenticeship programs to get people qualified to work at quality jobs without having a degree.
[02:47:54.421 --> 02:47:58.322]  I mean, we're doing things that our elected representatives should be doing on a regular basis.
[02:47:58.322 --> 02:47:59.342]  You're doing their job already.
[02:47:59.582 --> 02:48:01.242]  You know what, I didn't want to say it, but you said it.
[02:48:01.242 --> 02:48:02.803]  But yeah, we're doing our job.
[02:48:02.803 --> 02:48:04.143]  So why not give us a position?
[02:48:04.143 --> 02:48:05.284]  Joe Collins from Congress.com.
[02:48:05.284 --> 02:48:07.344]  Joe Collins, we appreciate you, man.
[02:48:07.344 --> 02:48:08.084]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:48:08.084 --> 02:48:10.025]  I'm glad you guys are here in Austin.
[02:48:10.025 --> 02:48:10.585]  Really appreciate it.
[02:48:10.585 --> 02:48:11.625]  Everybody should visit the website.
[02:48:11.625 --> 02:48:14.266]  They should support what you're doing because you're going up against pure evil.
[02:48:14.266 --> 02:48:16.227]  I'm going to come back, take a few calls.
[02:48:16.227 --> 02:48:17.407]  Then I've got a special report.
[02:48:17.407 --> 02:48:22.168]  And then Matt Bracken takes over ahead of the war room with Owens-Froyer.
[02:48:22.168 --> 02:48:24.989]  We're live on this Thursday, July 16th, 2020 transmission.
[02:48:24.989 --> 02:48:25.709]  109 days out from the election.
[02:48:31.545 --> 02:48:42.354]  Americans have had freedom for so long, and most Americans were born into such docile times compared to the rest of history, that we really have a blind spot for tyranny.
[02:48:42.354 --> 02:48:51.962]  We don't appreciate the American way, truth, justice, due process, the right to self-defense, private property, because we've had it so long, and we just think that's how the rest of the world is.
[02:48:51.962 --> 02:48:54.464]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Renaissance, the social contract,
[02:48:54.924 --> 02:49:02.451]  It's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong.
[02:49:02.451 --> 02:49:06.114]  It's something the West invented and that's what made our modern world.
[02:49:06.114 --> 02:49:20.326]  That's now been hijacked by the technocrats, by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be culled and dumbed down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate, manipulate and command if we're even lucky enough to stay alive.
[02:49:20.766 --> 02:49:22.447]  And that's what COVID-19 is.
[02:49:22.447 --> 02:49:29.150]  A global UN revolution against free humanity, against your family, against prosperity, and against your future.
[02:49:29.150 --> 02:49:33.211]  If you don't stand up and fight, you deserve what you get.
[02:49:33.211 --> 02:49:35.812]  A lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years.
[02:49:35.812 --> 02:49:48.598]  And if you go back to those shows, we laid out the AI takeover plan, the tracking of cell phones, how programmed master computers would manipulate, control society, how they'd be able to not just predict,
[02:49:49.138 --> 02:49:49.779]  I think so.
[02:50:09.156 --> 02:50:13.137]  But when we cover that, the media would attack us and say we were making it up.
[02:50:13.137 --> 02:50:18.379]  It was a conspiracy theory, even though it was in the actual corporate level blueprint documents.
[02:50:18.379 --> 02:50:26.261]  Well, the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out.
[02:50:26.261 --> 02:50:30.062]  And it's something about a thousand times crazier than what Hitler planned.
[02:50:30.062 --> 02:50:35.503]  So we might want to dismantle the system now.
[02:50:35.503 --> 02:50:38.104]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:51:05.117 --> 02:51:08.759]  We are back live, taking your phone calls for two segments.
[02:51:08.759 --> 02:51:11.220]  Thanks for holding after those guests were on.
[02:51:11.220 --> 02:51:13.321]  And then, Matt Bracken takes over.
[02:51:15.885 --> 02:51:18.806]  Well, with a name like Shrimp Dog, we gotta go to him.
[02:51:18.806 --> 02:51:24.608]  We'll go to Steve, Austin, Ruben, Debbie, Christian, and Anonymous.
[02:51:24.608 --> 02:51:27.269]  Shrimp Dog, you're on the air from Texas.
[02:51:27.269 --> 02:51:28.729]  Go ahead.
[02:51:28.729 --> 02:51:31.170]  Thank you, Alex Jones.
[02:51:31.170 --> 02:51:37.812]  May Almighty Father Yahweh in heaven above bless you and all of your loved ones.
[02:51:37.812 --> 02:51:39.252]  You too, brother.
[02:51:39.252 --> 02:51:44.934]  Because we are the electromagnetic, morphogenic, telekinetic,
[02:51:45.675 --> 02:51:47.796]  Transmitters and receivers!
[02:51:47.796 --> 02:51:48.156]  Yes!
[02:51:48.156 --> 02:51:57.200]  The body of the Messiah Yahshua and His Holy, Holy, Holy Spirit, my brother!
[02:51:57.200 --> 02:52:01.302]  I can tell you're transmitting right now, brother.
[02:52:01.302 --> 02:52:10.927]  May Yahweh also bless all of our enemies because they will be blessed with a just and righteous reward, my brother Alex.
[02:52:11.374 --> 02:52:13.015]  I tell you that, praise God.
[02:52:13.015 --> 02:52:18.657]  Now that we've thanked and praised Father Yahweh above, now let me thank my uncle.
[02:52:18.657 --> 02:52:20.398]  Yes, I call him uncle.
[02:52:20.398 --> 02:52:21.998]  Uncle Dealmaker.
[02:52:21.998 --> 02:52:33.683]  President Donald J. Trump, thank you for reaching deep down and grabbing your nuts and doing the right thing and the just thing about Mr. Roger Stone.
[02:52:33.683 --> 02:52:40.366]  And I put the video on and I danced with Roger and his family still now.
[02:52:40.366 --> 02:52:40.606]  Yes.
[02:52:41.380 --> 02:52:44.501]  Because us Sicilians do know how to dance.
[02:52:44.501 --> 02:52:47.762]  I'll tell you that, Alex Jones.
[02:52:47.762 --> 02:52:50.543]  And if you can dance, you can fight, too.
[02:52:50.543 --> 02:52:52.004]  That's what's up.
[02:52:52.004 --> 02:53:05.809]  And I'm also looking forward to Donald, the Uncle POTUS, reaching deep down again and grabbing the Nutsack of Righteousness for General Michael Flynn.
[02:53:05.809 --> 02:53:09.490]  Because I did sign that petition, too, Alex and Don.
[02:53:10.735 --> 02:53:11.636]  Yes I did!
[02:53:11.636 --> 02:53:14.017]  And I signed up for the Oath Keepers too!
[02:53:14.017 --> 02:53:16.058]  Shrimp Dog, it's beautiful.
[02:53:16.058 --> 02:53:18.700]  I can tell you right now, metaphysically I can see it.
[02:53:18.700 --> 02:53:20.541]  Trump's going on the war path.
[02:53:20.541 --> 02:53:23.122]  So it's going to get crazy now, brother.
[02:53:23.122 --> 02:53:25.103]  Bring it on!
[02:53:25.103 --> 02:53:26.744]  I agree, I'm ready for war.
[02:53:26.744 --> 02:53:28.525]  I told the New World Order, bring it on.
[02:53:28.525 --> 02:53:30.987]  It's not about acting tough anymore, man.
[02:53:30.987 --> 02:53:32.848]  I'm just sick of these people.
[02:53:32.848 --> 02:53:37.391]  I had a dream last night, where they put me in the ring on this big stone plateau.
[02:53:38.405 --> 02:53:44.807]  All these people watching with this giant wrecking machine and this 8-foot giant.
[02:53:44.807 --> 02:53:48.648]  And I felt confident I was going to beat him in the drain.
[02:53:48.648 --> 02:53:51.688]  But the whole point was, that's what this is all about.
[02:53:51.688 --> 02:53:52.949]  That's right, brother.
[02:53:52.949 --> 02:53:55.329]  But now, what's coming next?
[02:53:55.329 --> 02:54:02.491]  If and when Falke is fired, everyone will loosen up and recognize that COVID-19 is a scam.
[02:54:02.491 --> 02:54:06.632]  Then, when we're relaxed and fat and happy again, watching our sports,
[02:54:07.276 --> 02:54:09.698]  They'll release the real bioweapon.
[02:54:09.698 --> 02:54:19.267]  Another man-made, super deadly chimera that looks, lives, and acts just like COVID-19, but has a much, much higher kill rate.
[02:54:19.267 --> 02:54:21.088]  I agree.
[02:54:21.088 --> 02:54:29.416]  Also, I'm on record on The War Room theorizing that one day, we're gonna wake up and find out that we bombed China and Trump's dead.
[02:54:30.658 --> 02:54:46.902]  So overnight, they're going to bomb China and blame it all on Trump, of course, and use that as an excuse of why they had to kill him, because he flew off the handle and bombed China without anyone else's support.
[02:54:46.902 --> 02:54:49.183]  Well, you're laying the heavy knowledge on a shrimp dog.
[02:54:49.183 --> 02:54:49.583]  Thank you.
[02:54:49.583 --> 02:54:50.704]  God bless you.
[02:54:50.704 --> 02:54:52.004]  Wow.
[02:54:52.004 --> 02:54:54.985]  Yeah, that's exactly the type of stuff we're involved in now.
[02:54:54.985 --> 02:54:56.585]  I totally agree with the caller.
[02:54:56.585 --> 02:54:59.086]  We are in uncharted, super dangerous territory right now.
[02:55:03.484 --> 02:55:05.785]  Wow, I'm just speechless after that call.
[02:55:05.785 --> 02:55:08.125]  Wow, I'm glad I went to Shrimp Dog.
[02:55:08.125 --> 02:55:11.386]  Always put Shrimp Dog to the head of the line now when Shrimp Dog calls.
[02:55:11.386 --> 02:55:14.907]  We're gonna come back and I'm gonna jam in five or six calls.
[02:55:14.907 --> 02:55:19.169]  Ruben, Steven, Austin, Debbie, Christian, and Autonomous.
[02:55:19.169 --> 02:55:21.629]  Anonymous is the same thing as Autonomous.
[02:55:21.629 --> 02:55:23.670]  We're gonna take those calls straight ahead.
[02:55:24.921 --> 02:55:26.564]  All I want is a pro-human future.
[02:55:26.564 --> 02:55:28.809]  I don't give a rat's ass what color you are.
[02:55:28.809 --> 02:55:30.272]  You got red blood?
[02:55:30.272 --> 02:55:31.514]  Got your soul pointed to God?
[02:55:31.514 --> 02:55:34.019]  You wanna fight Satan?
[02:55:34.019 --> 02:55:34.820]  You're on my team.
[02:55:34.820 --> 02:55:35.502]  I'm on your team.
[02:55:35.502 --> 02:55:36.343]  Let's get it done.
[02:55:41.312 --> 02:55:56.877]  CNN, USA Today, and other mainstream media fake news outlets came out and said that a new Trump campaign t-shirt that has an American eagle spreading its wings standing on top of an American flag is Nazi!
[02:55:56.877 --> 02:56:04.740]  And they had the Soros-funded Snopes groups and others fact-check it and say, yes, now the American flag and yes, the American eagle are Nazis.
[02:56:04.740 --> 02:56:05.600]  No, George Soros
[02:56:05.640 --> 02:56:06.240]  We're good to go.
[02:56:34.637 --> 02:56:37.759]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic, it's Alex Jones.
[02:57:05.042 --> 02:57:06.563]  She'll slice you apart.
[02:57:06.563 --> 02:57:12.425]  She's a cool, cool black.
[02:57:12.425 --> 02:57:15.227]  Moves like a cat.
[02:57:15.227 --> 02:57:19.648]  And if she gets your name... Ha ha!
[02:57:19.648 --> 02:57:23.030]  You might not make it back.
[02:57:23.030 --> 02:57:24.931]  Ha ha ha!
[02:57:24.931 --> 02:57:27.772]  She's got the looks that kill.
[02:57:27.772 --> 02:57:31.153]  That kill.
[02:57:31.153 --> 02:57:32.834]  She's got the looks that kill.
[02:57:34.537 --> 02:57:38.298]  They're chill!
[02:57:38.298 --> 02:57:43.139]  She's got the look.
[02:57:43.139 --> 02:57:45.780]  Yeah, she's moving through.
[02:57:45.780 --> 02:57:48.761]  She keeps the motor clean.
[02:57:48.761 --> 02:57:51.542]  You believe me, you.
[02:57:51.542 --> 02:57:59.144]  She's a number 13.
[02:57:59.144 --> 02:58:00.724]  When the clock strikes midnight.
[02:58:02.415 --> 02:58:03.575]  Most important part right here.
[02:58:03.575 --> 02:58:04.515]  Crank it up.
[02:58:04.515 --> 02:58:09.796]  She's gonna turn on the juice boy.
[02:58:09.796 --> 02:58:14.977]  And then she'll... Turn on the power!
[02:58:14.977 --> 02:58:16.998]  Paulist don't want you to have power.
[02:58:16.998 --> 02:58:18.998]  They want you to have enslavement.
[02:58:18.998 --> 02:58:23.099]  I want you to have... Control of the future.
[02:58:23.099 --> 02:58:24.739]  Control of your destiny.
[02:58:24.739 --> 02:58:26.079]  And a connection to God.
[02:58:26.079 --> 02:58:29.520]  That's real power.
[02:58:29.520 --> 02:58:30.280]  She's got the look.
[02:58:32.691 --> 02:58:37.193]  Alright, let's go through these calls in closing before Matt Bracken takes over.
[02:58:37.193 --> 02:58:44.976]  Anonymous in Pennsylvania, you're on the air worldwide.
[02:58:44.976 --> 02:58:48.417]  And you hear the Jeopardy music?
[02:58:48.417 --> 02:58:50.118]  We'll go back to Anonymous in a minute.
[02:58:50.118 --> 02:58:52.498]  Let's go to Stephen in Florida.
[02:58:52.498 --> 02:58:53.539]  Stephen, you're on the air, go ahead.
[02:58:54.775 --> 02:58:56.096]  Yeah, hey, Alex.
[02:58:56.096 --> 02:59:03.382]  First of all, I want to say, Joe Collins, I hope you take Mad Maxine toilet waters and flush her insanity down the sewer.
[02:59:03.382 --> 02:59:05.883]  Yes, sir.
[02:59:05.883 --> 02:59:14.170]  I want to give a quick plug before I get to what I called about, which is the election, for some of your products, Alex, which I've been using a lot of them for a long time.
[02:59:14.170 --> 02:59:18.213]  I'm a runner, and this heat in Florida is brutal.
[02:59:18.213 --> 02:59:23.557]  So before I go run, I will take Turbo Force and Brain Force,
[02:59:24.178 --> 02:59:27.391]  Plus VasoBeat, Ultra 12, and Supermail.
[02:59:30.071 --> 02:59:38.858]  And then after my run, I will mix a scoop of Ultra Bone Broth with some organic almond milk.
[02:59:38.858 --> 02:59:41.320]  And I'll tell you, that really helps me immensely.
[02:59:41.320 --> 02:59:42.881]  So thank you very much for this time.
[02:59:42.881 --> 02:59:43.121]  No, no.
[02:59:43.121 --> 02:59:44.122]  Thank you for the support.
[02:59:44.122 --> 02:59:45.583]  These are all amazing products.
[02:59:45.583 --> 02:59:46.944]  They're all game changers.
[02:59:46.944 --> 02:59:50.967]  I think the products you mentioned is a good place for people to start at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:59:50.967 --> 02:59:52.348]  Without the purchases, we wouldn't be here.
[02:59:52.348 --> 02:59:53.649]  So thank you for the support, brother.
[02:59:53.649 --> 02:59:55.391]  I'm glad you tried the products out and had a good result.
[02:59:56.482 --> 03:00:03.543]  Yeah, now, I actually mentioned the election, but I want to mention something else real quickly.
[03:00:03.543 --> 03:00:09.004]  You mentioned about this 16-year-old kid with this oppositional defiant disorder.
[03:00:09.004 --> 03:00:13.245]  Of course, that's all part of the American Psychiatric Association.
[03:00:13.245 --> 03:00:17.826]  Yeah, no, the new thing is they forcibly now sterilize you to be a tranny.
[03:00:17.826 --> 03:00:21.847]  So, true medical experiments, true forced sterilization now happening.
[03:00:21.847 --> 03:00:22.447]  Can you believe this?
[03:00:23.638 --> 03:00:24.899]  Yeah, well, here's the thing.
[03:00:24.899 --> 03:00:28.261]  I want to tie it in with COVID-19, because think about this, Alex.
[03:00:28.261 --> 03:00:32.103]  They forcibly remove kids from their homes, so the kids freak out.
[03:00:32.103 --> 03:00:33.944]  They don't want to be subjected to this.
[03:00:33.944 --> 03:00:37.827]  They diagnose it as this oppositional defiant disorder.
[03:00:37.827 --> 03:00:38.247]  Boom!
[03:00:38.247 --> 03:00:43.130]  Okay, so we're going to inject them, and we're going to also drug them with these anti-psychotic drugs.
[03:00:43.130 --> 03:00:45.972]  Yeah, that's the global plan in the family is to sterilize men.
[03:00:45.972 --> 03:00:49.274]  It's the whole Tavistock Institute, the Caitlyn Jenner.
[03:00:49.274 --> 03:00:49.754]  It's the plan.
[03:00:51.078 --> 03:00:53.239]  Now, let me get to the election.
[03:00:53.239 --> 03:00:55.680]  I'm going to go out on a limb here and make a prediction.
[03:00:55.680 --> 03:01:01.902]  I don't see the election happening unless... Now, here's why, first of all.
[03:01:01.902 --> 03:01:03.583]  Oh, I agree.
[03:01:03.583 --> 03:01:06.804]  They're planning... I don't want to tell listeners this, I'll say it.
[03:01:06.804 --> 03:01:09.345]  With 109 days out, they're planning on canceling it.
[03:01:09.345 --> 03:01:11.386]  They got something big planned.
[03:01:11.386 --> 03:01:12.507]  Well, here's the thing.
[03:01:12.507 --> 03:01:15.388]  Antifa, Black Lives Matter, they're attacking all over the place.
[03:01:16.464 --> 03:01:22.407]  And I think that what they're going to do is try to sabotage the election with attacking the polling places.
[03:01:22.407 --> 03:01:43.377]  Plus, Alex, I don't know if you know this, you probably do, Dave Hodges has talked about this with the Common Sense Show, but the Chi-Coms, through Harry Reid and his backdoor deal with them, giving them control over the wind and solar farms, they have stout soldiers here overseeing those farms, which are waiting to awaken.
[03:01:43.377 --> 03:01:44.578]  Sir, I've been hearing this forever.
[03:01:44.918 --> 03:01:53.100]  Now they're catching and shipping weapons and silencers in, and I knew this months ago from sources in law enforcement, they were busting giant caches.
[03:01:53.100 --> 03:01:59.182]  I mean, thousands of full auto machine guns out of China being given to Antifa and BLM.
[03:01:59.182 --> 03:02:05.064]  They really are planning a violent overthrow, and they think we'll roll over during... I think it'll blow up in their face.
[03:02:05.064 --> 03:02:07.925]  God bless you, Steve.
[03:02:07.925 --> 03:02:10.866]  Okay, up next now is Christine in California.
[03:02:10.866 --> 03:02:11.366]  Thanks for holding.
[03:02:11.366 --> 03:02:11.626]  Go ahead.
[03:02:14.741 --> 03:02:15.822]  Hi, Christine in California.
[03:02:15.822 --> 03:02:16.102]  Welcome.
[03:02:16.102 --> 03:02:21.086]  Alright, they're gone.
[03:02:21.086 --> 03:02:21.767]  Debbie.
[03:02:21.767 --> 03:02:22.787]  Debbie in New Jersey.
[03:02:22.787 --> 03:02:23.328]  Thanks for holding.
[03:02:23.328 --> 03:02:24.429]  Go ahead.
[03:02:24.429 --> 03:02:24.989]  Hey, Alex.
[03:02:24.989 --> 03:02:29.473]  So, I was calling New Jersey 1 at 1.5 first of all, I just want to tell you.
[03:02:29.473 --> 03:02:31.534]  And they blocked me.
[03:02:31.534 --> 03:02:35.037]  I gave out your Band-Aid video to Bill Spady and Dennis and Judy.
[03:02:35.037 --> 03:02:38.400]  Now I'm no longer allowed to call.
[03:02:38.400 --> 03:02:42.443]  Well, you should use a spoofing number to call in and just change your name, but that's crazy.
[03:02:42.443 --> 03:02:43.244]  Well, good job doing that.
[03:02:43.820 --> 03:02:47.161]  Thank you.
[03:02:47.161 --> 03:02:53.882]  The Hells Angels, the Outlaws, and the Pagans fought each other for the longest time.
[03:02:53.882 --> 03:02:56.543]  They are no longer fighting each other.
[03:02:56.543 --> 03:02:56.823]  Okay?
[03:02:56.823 --> 03:03:03.064]  Because they were threatened, the Hells Angels were threatened by Black Lives Matter over a radio station.
[03:03:03.064 --> 03:03:05.104]  And they showed up in Seattle.
[03:03:05.104 --> 03:03:09.085]  And they've been showing up at all their little events.
[03:03:09.085 --> 03:03:12.126]  And they said they're not standing down against this BS going on.
[03:03:13.416 --> 03:03:19.198]  Obama had his army with MS-13 and all these other little retards.
[03:03:19.198 --> 03:03:22.359]  They gotta fight on their hands because... No, no, I agree with you.
[03:03:22.359 --> 03:03:27.521]  The motorcycle gangs, you're right, have stopped fighting each other because they realize the whole country's under attack.
[03:03:27.521 --> 03:03:28.222]  Right.
[03:03:28.222 --> 03:03:30.002]  That's right.
[03:03:30.002 --> 03:03:30.883]  I can't wait.
[03:03:30.883 --> 03:03:33.544]  I'm cheering them on and everybody should cheer them on.
[03:03:33.544 --> 03:03:39.726]  That's why they've been demonizing these guys for years and years because they know these are the guys that aren't going to take their crap.
[03:03:41.443 --> 03:03:41.923]  I agree with you.
[03:03:41.923 --> 03:03:47.585]  What else do you think is going to happen now, Debbie?
[03:03:47.585 --> 03:03:56.288]  I think really they're going to be the ones, they're going to be the saviors, along with the mafia families as well, because I have relatives that are in there too.
[03:03:56.288 --> 03:03:57.908]  Everybody's working together.
[03:03:57.908 --> 03:04:00.369]  These guys think they're such hot crap.
[03:04:00.369 --> 03:04:01.269]  I can't wait.
[03:04:01.269 --> 03:04:03.330]  I really can't, Alex, because I'm done with it.
[03:04:03.951 --> 03:04:13.797]  Well, you're right that even the mafia and even the Hells Angels and the Mongols and all those groups, they recognize an outside group taking them over.
[03:04:13.797 --> 03:04:20.461]  And so, they see a CHICOM-funded group taking them over, at least they have the instincts to not roll over.
[03:04:20.461 --> 03:04:22.122]  Is that what you're saying?
[03:04:22.122 --> 03:04:23.163]  You got it, 100%.
[03:04:23.163 --> 03:04:25.584]  And they're not going to roll over.
[03:04:25.584 --> 03:04:29.587]  Because I hear what goes on in their church, if you know what I'm saying.
[03:04:31.010 --> 03:04:31.810]  Oh, I hear you.
[03:04:31.810 --> 03:04:32.750]  Well, God bless you, Debbie.
[03:04:32.750 --> 03:04:33.831]  Thanks for the call.
[03:04:33.831 --> 03:04:36.571]  All right, let's take a few more calls here and close this out.
[03:04:36.571 --> 03:04:38.471]  Ruben in Texas has been holding a long time.
[03:04:38.471 --> 03:04:40.412]  Ruben, go ahead.
[03:04:40.412 --> 03:04:40.852]  Yes, sir.
[03:04:40.852 --> 03:04:41.952]  Thank you, Alex, for taking my call.
[03:04:41.952 --> 03:04:42.632]  I really appreciate it.
[03:04:42.632 --> 03:04:44.052]  Thank you, brother.
[03:04:44.052 --> 03:04:55.875]  Just wanted to... So, I do have a few suggestions for the president, as well as listeners and even mentors, what we can do to combat this clear communist threat that we face, this Marxist-Leninist threat.
[03:04:55.875 --> 03:04:56.155]  Oh, yeah.
[03:04:56.155 --> 03:04:57.595]  This is an attempted commie takeover.
[03:04:58.644 --> 03:04:59.304]  Absolutely.
[03:04:59.304 --> 03:05:00.905]  I see it in Austin all the time.
[03:05:00.905 --> 03:05:11.788]  And also, I want to point you and your crew to a video of Chrissy Teigen getting asked on the red carpet a few years back where's the craziest place that she had sex.
[03:05:11.788 --> 03:05:18.730]  And she told the camera guy, or the reporter rather, she looked at her husband on camera and said, what about that Obama thing?
[03:05:18.730 --> 03:05:21.250]  And her husband says, you guys have to play that video.
[03:05:21.250 --> 03:05:22.791]  But before I get into my suggestion... We will!
[03:05:22.791 --> 03:05:26.132]  Chrissy Teigen asked about craziest place she had sex.
[03:05:26.132 --> 03:05:27.132]  Is that the name of the video?
[03:05:28.317 --> 03:05:33.740]  Uh, just type in, uh, Chrissy Teigen, uh, the Obama thing, and it should be the- Oh, there it is.
[03:05:33.740 --> 03:05:34.360]  I already got it up.
[03:05:34.360 --> 03:05:34.940]  Alright.
[03:05:34.940 --> 03:05:35.881]  We got one minute, sir.
[03:05:35.881 --> 03:05:36.981]  Finish.
[03:05:36.981 --> 03:05:37.601]  Yes, yes, sir.
[03:05:37.601 --> 03:05:47.726]  So, real quick, Alex, before I get into my- my- my point, uh, just wanna throw out there, uh, out here in Austin at a- one of the PD- uh, police departments, I'm not gonna say which one, but I was a video technician.
[03:05:47.726 --> 03:05:51.068]  I have extensive linear editing, uh, video- Sure, so what'd you say?
[03:05:53.058 --> 03:05:54.159]  No, I just wanted to throw it out there.
[03:05:54.159 --> 03:06:02.142]  If you guys need crew or anybody behind or in front of a camera, I have experience, film experience, editing, I've done acting, I can do it all.
[03:06:02.142 --> 03:06:06.324]  Okay, guys, give his name and number, give it to Rob Do, or give it to Daria.
[03:06:06.324 --> 03:06:08.185]  We do need to hire a few more crew members.
[03:06:08.185 --> 03:06:11.206]  I don't have the extra money, but I'm just spending everything we've got to expand.
[03:06:11.206 --> 03:06:13.767]  So, yes sir, I love you, I appreciate your ribbon.
[03:06:13.767 --> 03:06:14.848]  Give his name and number to Do.
[03:06:14.848 --> 03:06:16.929]  Alright, I'm sorry to Austin and Marilyn.
[03:06:18.052 --> 03:06:19.734]  I got to, like, 40, 50 calls today.
[03:06:19.734 --> 03:06:20.635]  I did a good job.
[03:06:20.635 --> 03:06:21.616]  I'm out of time.
[03:06:21.616 --> 03:06:23.378]  Matt Bracken is ready to talk about all this.
[03:06:23.378 --> 03:06:26.342]  Best-selling author, former Navy SEAL, counterterrorism expert.
[03:06:26.342 --> 03:06:29.045]  He takes over on the other side.
[03:06:29.045 --> 03:06:30.286]  What an incredible time to be alive.
[03:06:30.286 --> 03:06:31.648]  Please stay with us.
[03:06:31.648 --> 03:06:33.530]  These are just incredible times.
[03:06:33.530 --> 03:06:35.372]  It's about to all get a lot crazier.
[03:06:35.372 --> 03:06:37.835]  Then the War Room's coming up today with special guests.
[03:06:39.582 --> 03:06:57.317]  Imagine telling someone just a year ago that in the middle of 2020, the Democrats as well as many Republican leaders will be calling for the United Nations WHO edict that all Americans wear masks, be a quote, federal order and mandate.
[03:06:57.317 --> 03:07:00.800]  Totally unconstitutional, annihilating states' rights.
[03:07:01.921 --> 03:07:02.742]  Think about that.
[03:07:02.742 --> 03:07:04.825]  A woman can kill her baby.
[03:07:04.825 --> 03:07:07.228]  We pay for illegal aliens healthcare.
[03:07:07.228 --> 03:07:16.018]  But you've got to wear a mask for a virus that killed 20 plus times less than what they said, even if you believe the official story.
[03:07:16.018 --> 03:07:19.262]  This is about the WHO, the globalists, testing their power.
[03:07:19.862 --> 03:07:37.298]  Through the media over the federal government to set policy in the United States This is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes in the Paris accord in all of it And by the way, they admit that they say now your carbons down one way or another you stupid Americans, huh?
[03:07:48.143 --> 03:07:49.624]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[03:07:49.624 --> 03:07:56.570]  Where did it come from?
[03:07:56.570 --> 03:08:03.095]  Infowarsstore.com We can't survive without pure, clean drinking water.

[03:08:35.310 --> 03:08:41.171]  Other systems, just don't compare.
[03:08:41.171 --> 03:08:43.792]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:09:01.048 --> 03:09:03.389]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:09:03.389 --> 03:09:10.912]  It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[03:09:10.912 --> 03:09:17.415]  Okay, it's good to be back talking to Information Army.
[03:09:17.415 --> 03:09:25.718]  You know, there's supposed to be an election this November, but whether it is actually pulled off or not remains to be seen.
[03:09:26.784 --> 03:09:34.309]  And whether the result will be respected by either side, I think it's very unlikely that it will.
[03:09:34.309 --> 03:09:46.017]  So by what should be the transition time late this fall, I think we're going to be in something resembling a full-scale civil war.
[03:09:46.017 --> 03:09:47.958]  And why do I say that?
[03:09:47.958 --> 03:09:50.319]  What's the basis for that?
[03:09:50.319 --> 03:09:54.422]  You know, it's obvious to anybody with eyes that can think
[03:09:55.250 --> 03:10:01.632]  That Joe Biden is, at this point in his life, no more than an empty shell.
[03:10:01.632 --> 03:10:18.817]  He's a suit with a massive blob of protoplasm inside of it that, on a good day, can read teleprompters, even though he has absolutely no sense of timing or what thought goes with what thought.
[03:10:18.817 --> 03:10:25.079]  And it's obvious that he might as well be just a virtual candidate.
[03:10:25.993 --> 03:10:28.714]  So who's really running him?
[03:10:28.714 --> 03:10:38.436]  By now, it's readily apparent that the Sanders clique, along with the Obama clique, are running him.
[03:10:38.436 --> 03:10:42.197]  That's who's in the basement writing his scripts.
[03:10:42.197 --> 03:10:52.320]  Even going a throwback to the 60s and 70s radical era, Angela Davis said she's going to support Biden
[03:10:53.297 --> 03:11:01.464]  Not that she likes Biden, but she knows he's just basically a stand-in for hard left politics.
[03:11:01.464 --> 03:11:08.609]  Angela Davis is a communist who brought guns to people who murdered a judge in court.
[03:11:08.609 --> 03:11:09.830]  She escaped the country.
[03:11:09.830 --> 03:11:12.172]  She became a left-wing heroine.
[03:11:12.172 --> 03:11:16.656]  She was trained by the Soviets while she was out of the country.
[03:11:16.656 --> 03:11:21.800]  She later became a lauded professor, a famous professor.
[03:11:22.732 --> 03:11:26.695]  A communist terrorist became a professor.
[03:11:26.695 --> 03:11:28.396]  Who does that sound like?
[03:11:28.396 --> 03:11:32.919]  That sounds like Bill Ayers, whose wife is Bernadine Dorn.
[03:11:32.919 --> 03:11:41.906]  They were weather underground terrorists also, who were welcomed back into academia and served out full careers.
[03:11:41.906 --> 03:11:49.551]  So these are the, these guys now are in their 70s, late 70s, and this is their last hurrah.
[03:11:49.551 --> 03:11:50.952]  They have never gone away.
[03:11:51.829 --> 03:12:06.496]  The same weather underground SDS terrorists from the 60s have been influencing the next three generations of Marxists coming through college.
[03:12:06.496 --> 03:12:17.601]  So now we've got multiple generations of college professors and now even high school professors or teachers that have been indoctrinating students in Marxism.
[03:12:20.023 --> 03:12:23.085]  The fruit is now being born.
[03:12:23.085 --> 03:12:38.234]  Another name that you've never heard of, that I'd like, you probably have never heard of, that I'd like to introduce to you, who is a contemporary of Bill Ayers and Angela Davis and Mark Rudd of The Weather Underground, is a guy named Bob Avakian.
[03:12:38.234 --> 03:12:47.960]  And Bob Avakian, since 1979, has run the Revolutionary Communist Party of the USA.
[03:12:48.737 --> 03:12:54.158]  You'll see on signs at demonstrations in the corner, look for RevCom.
[03:12:54.158 --> 03:12:57.819]  And it's RevCom.us is their website.
[03:12:57.819 --> 03:13:02.840]  But they can't make the word US, the sound US, come out of their mouth.
[03:13:02.840 --> 03:13:08.481]  So when they, when you hear them refer to their website, it's RevCom.us.
[03:13:08.481 --> 03:13:16.123]  That's a tell if a reporter or anybody else is referring to RevCom and they say RevCom.us, you know they're one of them.
[03:13:16.123 --> 03:13:16.983]  Anyway,
[03:13:18.220 --> 03:13:21.561]  Bob Avakian has been a prolific author.
[03:13:21.561 --> 03:13:24.422]  He's been around forever.
[03:13:24.422 --> 03:13:31.544]  His version of communism, he calls the New Communism, is a Maoist synthesis.
[03:13:31.544 --> 03:13:46.788]  So Mao Tse-Tung, who killed, you know, 50 to 100 million in China during the course of the 20th century, he's the ideological basis for Bob Avakian's New Communism.
[03:13:47.652 --> 03:13:49.153]  They've never quit.
[03:13:49.153 --> 03:13:53.775]  Now they're saying revolution, nothing less, nothing else, full revolution.
[03:13:53.775 --> 03:13:56.197]  They are going for it right now.
[03:13:56.197 --> 03:14:07.282]  And something that drives me nuts and people that should know better are often looking at places like Portland or Seattle or Minneapolis and they're saying, oh, they're anarchists.
[03:14:07.282 --> 03:14:10.644]  Look at those people smashing windows and burning buildings.
[03:14:10.644 --> 03:14:12.185]  They're anarchists.
[03:14:12.185 --> 03:14:13.605]  They are not anarchists.
[03:14:13.605 --> 03:14:16.527]  And this is the first layer of the onion I'd like to peel back.
[03:14:17.248 --> 03:14:20.190]  Anarchists don't have a goal or a purpose.
[03:14:20.190 --> 03:14:23.912]  They just have disorder for disorder's sake.
[03:14:23.912 --> 03:14:31.937]  A literal anarchist believes that mankind can just function like in nature with no government, no police, no laws.
[03:14:31.937 --> 03:14:33.718]  Obviously that's insane.
[03:14:33.718 --> 03:14:39.081]  That makes pure libertarianism look logical and plausible.
[03:14:39.081 --> 03:14:44.424]  So the people that are being called anarchists are actually the two layers now
[03:14:45.302 --> 03:14:50.045]  Overt layers are Antifa and BLM.
[03:14:50.045 --> 03:14:56.389]  Antifa stands for anti-fascist, obviously, and BLM stands for Black Lives Matter.
[03:14:56.389 --> 03:15:07.517]  But it's very important that you understand that Antifa and BLM are just cutouts or fronts for the revolutionary Communist Party.
[03:15:07.517 --> 03:15:08.017]  Period.
[03:15:08.817 --> 03:15:37.591]  The reason they do this is similar to the reason why corporations will create, you know, corporations that want to shift money around below the table, will create a series of cut-out corporations, proxies, shell corporations, you know, doing business as fictitious names, so that it's very hard to point directly from, you know, an action on the street to the leadership of the revolutionary Communist Party.
[03:15:38.493 --> 03:15:41.934]  They'll just say, oh Antifa, there's no leaders of Antifa.
[03:15:41.934 --> 03:15:49.076]  That has nothing to do with us, an actual organization, you know, with an actual leader, Bob Avakian.
[03:15:49.076 --> 03:15:51.077]  Same thing with BLM.
[03:15:51.077 --> 03:15:59.239]  They are, the originators of BLM call themselves, in their own words, trained Marxists.
[03:15:59.239 --> 03:16:05.741]  Part of that training is in clandestine operations and using cutouts.
[03:16:06.286 --> 03:16:19.993]  So that the overt, legitimate, so to speak, revolutionary communist party can't be blamed by the federal law enforcement agencies for, say, a wave of arson attacks.
[03:16:19.993 --> 03:16:21.834]  These are just cutouts.
[03:16:21.834 --> 03:16:28.437]  So please, any reporter now that uses the term anarchist is just admitting he's a fool.
[03:16:28.437 --> 03:16:32.439]  And when you think of and refer to Antifa and BLM,
[03:16:33.047 --> 03:16:37.849]  Just remember, those are masks for the Revolutionary Communist Party.
[03:16:37.849 --> 03:16:40.410]  They pick a name that you can't assail.
[03:16:40.410 --> 03:16:44.531]  They pick a name that is impossible to criticize.
[03:16:44.531 --> 03:16:50.434]  If you call yourself anti-fascist, then how in the world can you be against them?
[03:16:50.434 --> 03:16:52.134]  You must be a fascist.
[03:16:52.134 --> 03:16:55.056]  Or they call themselves Black Lives Matter.
[03:16:55.056 --> 03:16:56.876]  How can you be against BLM?
[03:16:56.876 --> 03:16:58.577]  Don't you think Black Lives Matter?
[03:16:59.241 --> 03:17:01.782]  This is completely predictable.
[03:17:01.782 --> 03:17:03.263]  It's right out of the playbook.
[03:17:03.263 --> 03:17:04.944]  It's been done forever.
[03:17:04.944 --> 03:17:08.926]  You can go back to revolutionary movements through the 20th century.
[03:17:08.926 --> 03:17:16.910]  They do the same thing, whether it's in labor politics or national politics, national separatist movements.
[03:17:16.910 --> 03:17:19.771]  Communists will put on whatever cloak
[03:17:20.267 --> 03:17:30.810]  Whatever mask fits the situation that allows them to operate without criticism while hiding the actual communist basis for the organization.
[03:17:30.810 --> 03:17:35.852]  When we come back, I'm going to talk about another character everybody should get to know very well.
[03:17:36.647 --> 03:17:37.148]  Very well.
[03:17:54.006 --> 03:17:59.929]  Store.com, get your orders in now before the next big surge comes in.

[03:18:07.154 --> 03:18:11.156]  The globalists have already created a worldwide depression, lockdowns on a planetary scale.
[03:18:11.596 --> 03:18:13.036]  And it's only intensifying.

[03:19:37.580 --> 03:19:39.021]  It's Christmas in July.
[03:19:39.021 --> 03:19:40.263]  We ran the sale last year.
[03:19:40.263 --> 03:19:42.024]  It was very, very popular.
[03:19:42.024 --> 03:19:48.310]  And so I am now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020, a very important election year.
[03:19:48.310 --> 03:19:53.855]  And we have some fabulous new shirts that I think should be the campaign shirt of 2020.
[03:19:53.855 --> 03:19:59.461]  It's the American Eagle, boldly spreading its wings, sitting atop a Betsy Ross flag.
[03:19:59.461 --> 03:20:02.123]  And the shirts are on sale right now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:20:03.244 --> 03:20:09.373]  I got the idea for the Trump campaign having a similar shirt to the media called Nazi, which of course it isn't.
[03:20:09.373 --> 03:20:14.020]  And since it's so triggering to the leftists and the globalists, well, we're gonna make sure there's even more of these on the streets.
[03:20:14.870 --> 03:20:16.230]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[03:21:00.974 --> 03:21:26.774]  Before I continue, I wanted to mention, I expect, you know, at any moment, I'm just going to be deleted from social media, from Amazon, from PayPal, things like that.
[03:21:26.774 --> 03:21:29.817]  So I recommend people get hard copy.
[03:21:30.723 --> 03:21:42.351]  Of some of my books, so that if, uh, especially if Biden wins, there's going to be mass deletion of material that you think you own on your device.
[03:21:42.351 --> 03:21:43.832]  It will just go poof.
[03:21:43.832 --> 03:21:49.556]  Unless your device is, you know, shielded in a safe, unconnected to anything wireless.
[03:21:49.556 --> 03:21:56.741]  When the powers that be decide that ideas like mine are just too dangerous to be out there, they're just going to blink out.
[03:21:56.741 --> 03:21:58.022]  They'll be gone from Audible.
[03:21:58.022 --> 03:21:59.263]  They'll be gone from Kindle.
[03:21:59.909 --> 03:22:01.150]  They'll be gone.
[03:22:01.150 --> 03:22:04.211]  So get hard copy backup where you can.
[03:22:04.211 --> 03:22:09.014]  And if you get them from me, you don't have to give Jeff Bezos half of your money.
[03:22:09.014 --> 03:22:21.000]  Anyway, in the last segment, I was talking about Bob Avakian, who is a contemporary in the Students for Democratic Society, which morphed into Weather Underground Terrorists.
[03:22:21.000 --> 03:22:26.823]  He was a contemporary colleague of people like Angela Davis, Bernadine Dorn, Bill Ayers,
[03:22:29.716 --> 03:22:32.757]  Mark Rudd, he never went away.
[03:22:32.757 --> 03:22:37.919]  For the last 40 years, he's run the Revolutionary Communist Party of the USA.
[03:22:37.919 --> 03:22:41.000]  The way that these people work, though, is through cutouts.
[03:22:41.000 --> 03:22:53.504]  So you'll never see Bob Avakian sitting right next to, you know, Susan Rice or Obama or Hillary Clinton.
[03:22:53.504 --> 03:22:54.424]  But their friends do.
[03:22:55.051 --> 03:23:02.295]  You know, Avakian will sit with Cornel West, and then the next week Cornel West is on PBS.
[03:23:02.295 --> 03:23:06.377]  You know, so this is a click, and they are seeing their moment.
[03:23:06.377 --> 03:23:08.318]  Their moment is coming.
[03:23:08.318 --> 03:23:14.381]  And Bob Avakian, even back in the 60s, was very close to the Black Panther Party.
[03:23:14.381 --> 03:23:16.322]  Now, we know that the Black Panther Party
[03:23:17.324 --> 03:23:35.857]  And other black organizations often were semi-run or so strongly infiltrated by the FBI that it's hard to know where was the Black Panther Party, the genuine Black Panther Party, and where was it just a chimera of the FBI.
[03:23:35.857 --> 03:23:44.243]  But there's a new Black Panther Party arising with a new star, a guy named Grandmaster Jay.
[03:23:44.878 --> 03:23:52.103]  The world first saw him at Stone Mountain, Georgia on the 4th of July when he mustered his troops.
[03:23:52.103 --> 03:24:00.789]  And it was pretty shocking at first because, you know, he was calling out the Boogaloo boys and the, you know, the White Crackers and the militias.
[03:24:00.789 --> 03:24:01.930]  Where are you?
[03:24:01.930 --> 03:24:03.611]  We're in your house.
[03:24:03.611 --> 03:24:11.296]  He mustered a couple hundred guys wearing more or less black uniforms that could more or less march, carrying more or less rifles.
[03:24:12.048 --> 03:24:22.715]  Although it's been pointed out many of the rifles appeared to be non-functional, had no sights, sights were on backwards, had ammunition jammed in the chambers.
[03:24:22.715 --> 03:24:24.756]  But that's really missing the point.
[03:24:24.756 --> 03:24:31.820]  The fact that he could muster these people without notice, under the radar, I don't care if they were actors.
[03:24:31.820 --> 03:24:34.362]  And I don't care if half the weapons were airsoft.
[03:24:34.362 --> 03:24:37.764]  I would doubt seriously that any of the weapons were even loaded.
[03:24:38.359 --> 03:24:39.460]  Because it was a show.
[03:24:39.460 --> 03:24:45.183]  It was coming out, kind of an audition for being a national leader.
[03:24:45.183 --> 03:24:51.947]  Well, I've dug into this, and the real name of Grandmaster Jay, he's actually not a secret.
[03:24:51.947 --> 03:24:56.130]  His name is John Fitzgerald Johnson.
[03:24:56.130 --> 03:25:00.632]  And he's been a rapper, and he's been an IT guy.
[03:25:00.632 --> 03:25:06.476]  If the information on his LinkedIn page is true, he's got a pretty strong IT background.
[03:25:06.932 --> 03:25:09.934]  He knows his way around computer networks.
[03:25:09.934 --> 03:25:11.314]  He's no dummy.
[03:25:11.314 --> 03:25:15.036]  He served in the military in the 90s.
[03:25:15.036 --> 03:25:26.782]  Not sure about his qualifications, whether they're legit or not, from what's on the photos, but let's run the first clip and we'll give you a little look into the thinking of Grandmaster Jay.
[03:25:28.615 --> 03:25:38.381]  And I have a direct message to the entire black slash African slash African, the way they like to give us name, but I don't care.
[03:25:38.381 --> 03:25:45.324]  A message to the entire Melanated family all over this planet.
[03:25:45.324 --> 03:25:46.885]  Master Jay.
[03:25:46.885 --> 03:25:52.288]  Thank you very much to all of my brothers and sisters around the world.
[03:25:52.288 --> 03:25:56.591]  No matter what country you may live in, I am now talking to you.
[03:25:57.537 --> 03:26:03.199]  The time has come for us to throw off the shackles, take off the mental chains.
[03:26:03.199 --> 03:26:06.880]  The time has come for us to stand together.
[03:26:06.880 --> 03:26:10.502]  You have no leadership at a global level.
[03:26:10.502 --> 03:26:12.363]  You don't want to unify.
[03:26:12.363 --> 03:26:14.123]  You don't want to follow.
[03:26:14.123 --> 03:26:15.884]  You don't want to kill.
[03:26:15.884 --> 03:26:17.625]  You don't want to separate.
[03:26:17.625 --> 03:26:20.225]  You don't want to demand what's owed to you.
[03:26:20.225 --> 03:26:23.767]  You have become your own worst enemy.
[03:26:23.767 --> 03:26:26.368]  That time must come to an end.
[03:26:27.188 --> 03:26:32.876]  It is time now, wherever you are, to identify with your like-minded brothers and sisters.
[03:26:32.876 --> 03:26:36.460]  Stop hating on each other because it's a brainwash.
[03:26:36.460 --> 03:26:40.886]  Stop fearing laws because those laws were not written by you.
[03:26:40.886 --> 03:26:42.147]  We are approaching a time
[03:26:42.668 --> 03:26:56.922]  When we must all come together as one, and I don't mean just in unity, I mean in our finances, I mean in our education, I mean in the reclaimation of our land, and I mean in the fighting of a common enemy.
[03:26:56.922 --> 03:27:03.849]  If nobody will lead you, I will step into that role and anyone that comes behind me must carry us forward.
[03:27:03.849 --> 03:27:06.452]  So I say to all of you, there is nothing
[03:27:06.972 --> 03:27:12.257]  But genuine love from this brother for all of you worldwide.
[03:27:12.257 --> 03:27:24.287]  And I know that my people, as compassionate as we are, as forgiving as we are, as educated and talented as we are, that when it comes to the salvation of the black race,
[03:27:24.807 --> 03:27:26.568]  We can do this.
[03:27:26.568 --> 03:27:37.591]  To my brothers in the UK, my brothers and sisters in Africa, in the Caribbean, South America, and all across the United States of America and Canada, you hear my voice.
[03:27:37.591 --> 03:27:40.993]  Listen to the spirit that dwells within you.
[03:27:40.993 --> 03:27:44.394]  It is our time to solidify behind leadership
[03:27:45.274 --> 03:27:47.296]  It is our time to unify.
[03:27:47.296 --> 03:27:51.440]  It is our time to learn that you're going to have to follow.
[03:27:51.440 --> 03:27:55.865]  It is our time to know that we may have to kill some people to be free.
[03:27:55.865 --> 03:27:59.629]  It is our time to separate.
[03:27:59.629 --> 03:28:00.790]  Integrate is not
[03:28:01.070 --> 03:28:01.930]  Working.
[03:28:01.930 --> 03:28:13.932]  It is our time to demand what is owed to us, and it is our time for us no longer to think of ourselves as our worst enemy, but to think of the other man as our worst enemy.
[03:28:13.932 --> 03:28:21.194]  I bid you peace, I bid you shalom, and I bid you that I will see you soon on your own soil.
[03:28:21.194 --> 03:28:29.395]  And that is coming from Grandmaster Jay, the NFAC, and on behalf of all of your brothers and sisters in the United States, I say Uhuru!
[03:28:34.448 --> 03:28:37.190]  This guy is pretty serious.
[03:28:37.190 --> 03:28:46.336]  He doesn't have a huge YouTube presence on his own channel, which is called The Official Grandmaster Jay.
[03:28:46.336 --> 03:28:55.321]  He actually ran for president in 2016 as an independent under his own name, which is John Fitzgerald Johnson.
[03:28:55.321 --> 03:28:57.203]  He's a pretty talented guy.
[03:28:57.203 --> 03:29:01.485]  On other videos, he can work without notes for any length of time.
[03:29:03.354 --> 03:29:18.459]  In another video, in the same video but further back, the host with the funny hat, the African hat, asks him about his leading figures of his life, and he says, I am all of them.
[03:29:18.459 --> 03:29:25.181]  And he speaks about Malcolm X, Oakley Carmichael, Huey P. Newton, those are Black Panthers, Marcus Garvey,
[03:29:25.960 --> 03:29:33.903]  Qaddafi, Farrakhan, Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Elijah Muhammad, the founder of Nation of Islam.
[03:29:33.903 --> 03:29:35.444]  He says, I am all of them.
[03:29:35.444 --> 03:29:37.805]  He's like channeling their spirit.
[03:29:37.805 --> 03:29:41.706]  And he is absolutely putting himself forward to be a national leader.
[03:29:41.706 --> 03:29:51.410]  Now, when we come back, I'm going to talk about what he has been saying about Louisville, Kentucky, with the Breonna Taylor situation, police killing there.
[03:29:51.966 --> 03:30:01.711]  And he is suggesting that he is going to bring his armed black militia to Louisville in ten times the numbers.
[03:30:01.711 --> 03:30:07.714]  So Stone Mountain you can look at as like an audition tape or an introduction reel.
[03:30:07.714 --> 03:30:12.116]  What he's planning for is something much bigger in Louisville and other places.
[03:30:12.116 --> 03:30:17.699]  But really, he sees himself as a national and even global black leader.
[03:30:17.699 --> 03:30:20.460]  And before you laugh, this guy is an orator.
[03:30:20.987 --> 03:30:22.548]  And he is smart.
[03:30:22.548 --> 03:30:32.212]  And there was a guy in the 1920s in Germany who was an Austrian corporal that people laughed at, but he was a great orator and he went very far.
[03:30:32.212 --> 03:30:34.353]  We're going to talk about that in the next section.
[03:30:34.353 --> 03:30:40.576]  The reasons that the globalists launch this planetary lockdown.
[03:30:40.576 --> 03:30:44.757]  The number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes.
[03:30:44.757 --> 03:30:48.399]  We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[03:30:49.226 --> 03:30:55.288]  The cashless society, the surveillance system, global government, medical tyranny, forced inoculation.
[03:30:55.288 --> 03:31:11.534]  But the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete, that we are non-essential, as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had by design.
[03:31:11.534 --> 03:31:15.595]  This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into.
[03:31:15.595 --> 03:31:18.296]  It's been pre-planned, organized, globally.
[03:31:18.829 --> 03:31:32.161]  It's extremely predatory and through governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations, the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power.
[03:31:32.774 --> 03:31:36.115]  This is the truest form of technocracy fascism.
[03:31:36.115 --> 03:31:39.115]  I know what we'll do to make them conform to our cult.
[03:31:39.115 --> 03:31:47.657]  We'll all tell them to wear masks or they're gonna die, and then we'll release the pressure for a while, then bring it back and squeeze it harder, and release it again, and we'll be the virtue signalers.
[03:31:47.657 --> 03:31:52.258]  We'll be the angels, even though our lord and master Bill Gates helped fund the whole COVID-19.
[03:31:52.258 --> 03:31:54.178]  No, don't sadookie me!
[03:31:57.719 --> 03:32:08.271]  That's right, that's the code word for Bill Gates' operation he carries out with his good little buddy Dr. Fauci in the surgeon cult.
[03:32:08.271 --> 03:32:13.337]  As you know for girls there's five different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance novels.
[03:32:13.337 --> 03:32:16.181]  One of them is the vampire, the werewolf, the
[03:32:16.681 --> 03:32:19.663]  Psychopaths are so hot.
[03:32:19.663 --> 03:32:19.923]  Oh, yeah.
[03:32:46.727 --> 03:32:53.569]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[03:32:53.569 --> 03:32:56.310]  Where did it come from?
[03:32:56.310 --> 03:33:01.672]  Infowarsstore.com We can't survive without pure, clean drinking water.

[03:33:18.097 --> 03:33:20.198]  Yummy in my tummy.

[03:33:33.903 --> 03:33:36.324]  Other systems, just don't compare.
[03:33:36.324 --> 03:33:42.306]  Under the mega-opolis technocracy plan, things are going to be so incredibly
[03:33:42.972 --> 03:33:43.672]  Fair.
[03:33:43.672 --> 03:33:44.152]  Wonderful.
[03:33:44.152 --> 03:33:52.976]  Because an all-seeing, all-loving computer that doesn't discriminate is going to decide who gets what resources, who gets what jobs.
[03:33:52.976 --> 03:34:06.621]  But in reality, it's building a post-human world so that you can be made obsolete, domesticated, dumbed down, drugged, distracted, atomized, and then slowly killed.
[03:34:06.621 --> 03:34:08.722]  This is the brave new world.
[03:34:09.460 --> 03:34:11.061]  It's the post-human world.
[03:34:11.061 --> 03:34:18.105]  It's the dreaming of the post-human world that Wired Magazine and the Wall Street Journal all tell us about.
[03:34:18.105 --> 03:34:21.287]  Oh, now they tell us our smartphones don't just track our every move.
[03:34:21.287 --> 03:34:26.891]  They're monitoring our psychology and sending it back to a corporate database globally.
[03:34:26.891 --> 03:34:36.617]  You see, the bear trap closed on our lead now, and the vampire walked out of the bushes and is explaining to us how he's slowly gonna bleed us and destroy us.
[03:34:40.407 --> 03:34:57.761]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:34:57.761 --> 03:35:04.607]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:35:04.607 --> 03:35:07.990]  And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[03:35:12.551 --> 03:35:18.416]  He's talking about the rising star, Grandmaster Jay.
[03:35:18.416 --> 03:35:24.161]  He's a radical black separatist, very talented, from a new generation.
[03:35:24.161 --> 03:35:25.142]  He's not young, though.
[03:35:25.142 --> 03:35:27.104]  He's born in 63.
[03:35:27.104 --> 03:35:37.954]  But he's a generation, he's sort of a tweener between the 60s, still surviving leftovers like Bill Ayers, Bob Avakian, Angela Davis.
[03:35:38.700 --> 03:35:41.001]  He's a connection to this era.
[03:35:41.001 --> 03:35:42.141]  So he's very fit.
[03:35:42.141 --> 03:35:43.542]  You would think he's a younger guy.
[03:35:43.542 --> 03:35:46.683]  I mean, he looks more like 40 than 56.
[03:35:46.683 --> 03:35:50.784]  So the dude definitely stays in shape and he's driven.
[03:35:50.784 --> 03:35:52.525]  He's got a fire inside of him.
[03:35:52.525 --> 03:35:56.706]  I mean in his own terms, he is legit.
[03:35:57.352 --> 03:36:01.714]  He is a strong character, and people are listening to him.
[03:36:01.714 --> 03:36:08.316]  You can mock him, you can make fun of his jammed weapons, etc., but that was just a show.
[03:36:08.316 --> 03:36:10.697]  Stone Mountain was a production.
[03:36:10.697 --> 03:36:21.241]  And I would challenge any Cracker militia type, get out there with 200 of your guys in your uniforms, anywhere, anytime.
[03:36:21.241 --> 03:36:22.741]  200 in your uniforms.
[03:36:22.741 --> 03:36:23.521]  Can't be done.
[03:36:23.521 --> 03:36:25.062]  Can't compare that to, say, Richmond.
[03:36:25.709 --> 03:36:30.591]  Or a state capitol boogaloo where it's just individuals massing.
[03:36:30.591 --> 03:36:43.315]  This is one character, Fitzgerald, Fitzgerald Johnson, who got these hundreds of people organized and marching and somewhat disciplined.
[03:36:43.315 --> 03:36:47.116]  They didn't start trash-talking the people in their cars except for himself.
[03:36:47.116 --> 03:36:51.558]  I mean, this is a unit that's going to have a national presence.
[03:36:51.558 --> 03:36:54.999]  If they go to Louisville, like he is talking about, or somewhere else,
[03:36:55.836 --> 03:36:58.739]  It's going to be something to behold.
[03:36:58.739 --> 03:37:06.845]  He's saying 10 times bigger than Stone Mountain, and he's going to be in Louisville, Kentucky, which is not, you know, Georgia.
[03:37:06.845 --> 03:37:12.050]  It's multiple states away, so he's showing a national footprint.
[03:37:12.050 --> 03:37:18.235]  And, you know, this is a home of a lot of special forces and airborne military guys.
[03:37:18.235 --> 03:37:19.296]  A lot of pushback.
[03:37:19.296 --> 03:37:21.458]  This time it won't be under the radar.
[03:37:21.458 --> 03:37:22.479]  It'll be very known.
[03:37:23.092 --> 03:37:31.438]  So he'll be taking a chance of some kind of a collision with the people he's been calling out, the so-called Boogaloo Boys, the Crackers.
[03:37:31.438 --> 03:37:32.059]  Where are you?
[03:37:32.059 --> 03:37:34.241]  You know, we're in your house.
[03:37:34.241 --> 03:37:36.582]  Anyway, I'd like to show another clip.
[03:37:36.582 --> 03:37:40.105]  It had to be censored a little bit because he's pretty angry in this one.
[03:37:40.105 --> 03:37:51.514]  He's talking about, if you watch these entire videos, and I suggest you do, in this video he's talking about Breonna Taylor and the fact that the police haven't been arrested and what he's going to do about it.
[03:37:51.514 --> 03:37:52.735]  If you can roll clip two now.
[03:37:53.908 --> 03:37:59.093]  Now I'm going to say this, and I'm going to say it publicly.
[03:37:59.093 --> 03:38:10.485]  If you thought what happened in Stone Mountain was big, if I call a formation in Louisville, it's going to be 10 times as big.
[03:38:10.485 --> 03:38:12.687]  And I'm not going to guarantee anything.
[03:38:12.687 --> 03:38:15.710]  Y'all need to move on.
[03:38:17.173 --> 03:38:19.935]  Or we're going to move on you.
[03:38:19.935 --> 03:38:25.159]  The next Black Guns Formation I'm going to call is going to be in Louisville.
[03:38:25.159 --> 03:38:28.381]  And I'm going to call everybody who can carry a gun.
[03:38:28.381 --> 03:38:33.405]  This shit is ridiculous.
[03:38:33.405 --> 03:38:39.069]  You scared-ass white folks don't want to fix this shit, then you shouldn't have fucked it up from the beginning.
[03:38:39.069 --> 03:38:44.373]  And now the black race is tired of sitting back watching y'all sit there like y'all really think we won't come up in that.
[03:38:48.720 --> 03:38:52.983]  Now y'all can sit there and keep talking about, oh, we just getting the investigation and the tapes.
[03:38:52.983 --> 03:38:53.904]  Okay, that's fine.
[03:38:53.904 --> 03:39:00.308]  I need the mayor to come out and hold a press conference and say, look, we f***ed up, and we're gonna make it right.
[03:39:00.308 --> 03:39:06.913]  And y'all, you know, we apologize to the family, and we apologize to the Taylor family, and we apologize to the bruh.
[03:39:06.913 --> 03:39:10.275]  We need to see that.
[03:39:10.275 --> 03:39:14.999]  All you Jim Bourbon whiskey drinking f***ers should expect us to pull up in your town.
[03:39:17.182 --> 03:39:25.164]  I'm going to be honest with you, I can't hold all these motherfuckers back.
[03:39:25.164 --> 03:39:28.546]  Yeah, he says he can't hold all his bruhs back.
[03:39:28.546 --> 03:39:34.007]  They're getting antsy for action, according to Grandmaster Jay.
[03:39:34.007 --> 03:39:37.308]  And again, you can mock him if you want.
[03:39:37.308 --> 03:39:45.391]  There was a very fiery Austrian corporal that people, you know, called Schnickelgruber and made cartoons and humorous movies about in the 1920s.
[03:39:46.929 --> 03:39:49.452]  But the man's got charisma.
[03:39:49.452 --> 03:39:51.293]  This is just a small sampling.
[03:39:51.293 --> 03:39:54.897]  I suggest you look at his YouTube channel.
[03:39:54.897 --> 03:39:59.561]  He's on Pinterest and other places that I'm not really that familiar with.
[03:39:59.561 --> 03:40:08.110]  But the reason I bring him up, he's this tweener between the Bill Ayers, Bob Ivecki, and Weather Underground terrorist generation.
[03:40:08.945 --> 03:40:13.848]  Who are sliding into the White House because they are very connected.
[03:40:13.848 --> 03:40:18.571]  Angela Davis and Bernadine Dorn and Bill Ayers, they are honored members of the left.
[03:40:18.571 --> 03:40:24.435]  They're kind of kept at a distance because of their terrorism connections.
[03:40:24.435 --> 03:40:29.558]  But their cadres are sliding into the White House.
[03:40:29.558 --> 03:40:34.061]  They see Biden as their hollow shell, their mouthpiece.
[03:40:34.702 --> 03:40:36.583]  It's going to be extremely radical.
[03:40:36.583 --> 03:40:39.425]  If this country elects Biden, oh my God.
[03:40:39.425 --> 03:40:48.030]  And if the country doesn't elect Biden, they're going to turn every city into Portland to the greatest extent that they can.
[03:40:48.030 --> 03:41:01.238]  Now, I would say this to Grandmaster Jay and people like him, they have been used as a cat's paw by these old white communist radicals ever since the sixties.
[03:41:01.238 --> 03:41:02.519]  It's, you know, it's great for,
[03:41:03.140 --> 03:41:21.613]  These old white communists to push a black face out there to take the brunt, you know, to get spun up, to turn violent, and then take the brunt, just causing as much chaos as possible to create the correct revolutionary conditions.
[03:41:21.613 --> 03:41:30.019]  But behind Black Lives Matter and Antifa is the Revolutionary Communist Party dot us, U.S.
[03:41:30.706 --> 03:41:40.454]  And they are so interwoven with the people that have been circulating around the Clintons and the Obamas for the last 40 years.
[03:41:40.454 --> 03:41:42.336]  It's the same group.
[03:41:42.336 --> 03:41:49.662]  Now, if the pattern is followed in Portland, we're going to see this chaos spreading.
[03:41:49.662 --> 03:41:50.002]  Why?
[03:41:50.002 --> 03:41:55.287]  Because Antifa BLM radicals have no fear of being arrested.
[03:41:55.708 --> 03:42:02.011]  There are videos out of Portland where people are being arrested and they're saying, they're saying to the one being arrested, what's your name?
[03:42:02.011 --> 03:42:03.971]  Don't worry, we'll have you right out.
[03:42:03.971 --> 03:42:05.412]  We'll get the NLG.
[03:42:05.412 --> 03:42:07.573]  The NLG will have you out.
[03:42:07.573 --> 03:42:10.734]  The NLG is the National Lawyers Guild.
[03:42:10.734 --> 03:42:16.376]  This is a communist pro bono lawyers group funded by George Soros.
[03:42:16.376 --> 03:42:18.097]  So they've got unlimited money.
[03:42:19.045 --> 03:42:25.269]  So if you are an arsonist, a terrorist, a bomber, they will bail you out.
[03:42:25.269 --> 03:42:38.137]  This is all happening in cities that are run by these communist DAs, also put in office by George Soros, who lavishly funded their campaigns, like the McCloskeys found out in St.
[03:42:38.137 --> 03:42:38.937]  Louis.
[03:42:38.937 --> 03:42:43.620]  You wind up with district attorneys that will free any communist.
[03:42:44.275 --> 03:42:48.918]  And jail any American like the McCloskeys or try to indict them.
[03:42:48.918 --> 03:42:51.239]  This is a pattern that's going to be continuing.
[03:42:51.239 --> 03:42:58.763]  I recommend you seriously get out of any blue jurisdiction as soon as possible because it's going to hit the fan.
[03:42:58.763 --> 03:43:05.566]  And the only thing that Antifa and BLM fear at this point is federal law enforcement.
[03:43:05.566 --> 03:43:10.529]  But federal law enforcement itself is very split within federal law enforcement.
[03:43:11.015 --> 03:43:17.536]  There are very many, not enough, but very many hardcore tactical units.
[03:43:17.536 --> 03:43:24.658]  Actual street feds, DEA, ATF even, FBI.
[03:43:24.658 --> 03:43:29.098]  The hardcore tactical units are the skull stompers.
[03:43:29.098 --> 03:43:30.359]  They don't give a crap.
[03:43:30.359 --> 03:43:34.099]  They came out of the military and they want to fight.
[03:43:34.099 --> 03:43:35.580]  They're ready in Portland.
[03:43:35.580 --> 03:43:37.880]  They're ready to take the Portland tactics elsewhere.
[03:43:38.550 --> 03:43:48.118]  They're going to start making arrests, but they need to forget about these idiots throwing the Molotovs that are just, you know, the cannon fodder.
[03:43:48.118 --> 03:43:57.085]  What they've got to do is peel back the money through the National Lawyers Guild back to RevCom.us.
[03:43:57.085 --> 03:44:05.292]  When people weigh up the chain that are hiding behind cutouts, that are hiding behind shells, you know, several steps from
[03:44:06.111 --> 03:44:14.675]  RevolutionaryCommunistParty.us, you know, threw Antifa and BLM to these guys on the street, so-called anarchists.
[03:44:14.675 --> 03:44:18.137]  They need to start making the arrests up the chain.
[03:44:18.137 --> 03:44:33.204]  The DEA especially has lots of experience at this in unwinding the financial connections so that they're not just arresting, you know, street dealers but trying to find the actual, you know, cartel logistics guys.
[03:44:33.703 --> 03:44:36.845]  And then eventually the actual cartel bosses.
[03:44:36.845 --> 03:44:41.428]  That's who it's gonna take being arrested to put an end to this.
[03:44:41.428 --> 03:44:45.150]  There's an unlimited supply of these Antifa creeps.
[03:44:45.150 --> 03:44:59.038]  But one thing I'll say about Antifa getting arrested, and it warms my heart, when these mostly white skinny punks and girls get thrown in actual federal penitentiary, it's going to be worse than hell for them.
[03:44:59.038 --> 03:44:59.758]  The white gangs,
[03:45:01.021 --> 03:45:07.845]  The Aryan Nations, the biker gangs, even the Hispanic gangs and the black gangs are all going to hate them.
[03:45:07.845 --> 03:45:17.811]  The white groups in prison will hate them as communists, and the black gangs and Hispanic gangs will consider them sellouts and traitors.
[03:45:17.811 --> 03:45:23.574]  They will have the worst hell ever when they go to prison, and it can't happen soon enough.
