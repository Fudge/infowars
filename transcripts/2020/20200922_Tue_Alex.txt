[00:00:00.129 --> 00:00:04.193]  So there is red fire in the sky on the West Coast.
[00:00:05.114 --> 00:00:07.616]  And there is political red fire above D.C.
[00:00:07.636 --> 00:00:19.708]  And we're living in such an incredibly amazing and thought-provoking and dangerous time, but you're seeing humanity awaken, but only partially that Democrats will wreck the nation, and the Democrats are bad people.
[00:00:20.088 --> 00:00:24.293]  Folks, they are sinister forces of foreign powers.
[00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:28.628]  They want to totally implode the nation so they can consolidate power and control.
[00:00:29.389 --> 00:00:36.134]  And that's their own admissions, so that they can get all the land, the property, the wealth, the weapons, for nothing.
[00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:41.738]  And it's Chinese, communist-backed, through the globalists, that control China.
[00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:45.321]  This is a doomsday scenario.
[00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:49.364]  And communist China has been flying bombers over Taiwan and Hong Kong, threatening to attack.
[00:00:50.485 --> 00:00:52.987]  Hong Kong and Taiwan have issued statements saying they're ready to go to war.
[00:00:54.622 --> 00:01:01.866]  This is the type of political and cultural and historical climate where you get big wars.
[00:01:02.327 --> 00:01:08.851]  And all the mainline historians and analysts agree, we are right where we were at the beginning of World War I, right where we were at the beginning of World War II.
[00:01:09.231 --> 00:01:11.012]  All of the ingredients are there.
[00:01:11.072 --> 00:01:18.336]  And it's just a time to have our heads screwed on straight and to get on our knees to God, because this is the big one, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:18.777 --> 00:01:23.379]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:38.796]  Directed Energy Weapons, also known as DEWS, are weapons that deploy a highly focused energy beam, including lasers, microwaves, and particle beams.
[00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:54.469]  After decades of research in the United States, defense contractors announced back in 2015 that these systems are expected to come online by 2020, and are currently announcing that they are ready to deploy in the field.
[00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:01.475]  Russia, China, India, and the UK are developing directed energy weapons as well.
[00:02:02.423 --> 00:02:05.465]  And Iran has had them in use since at least 2013.
[00:02:08.207 --> 00:02:19.455]  In 2019, Turkey was the first to officially deploy this technology in combat, when they claimed to have shot down a Chinese-made drone supplied to the Libyan National Army.
[00:02:20.896 --> 00:02:30.664]  On September 16th, Defense Secretary Mark Esper announced that China and Russia have already weaponized satellites with directed energy weapons.
[00:02:31.044 --> 00:02:36.828]  Meanwhile, in space, Moscow and Beijing have turned a once peaceful arena into a warfighting domain.
[00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:46.256]  They have weaponized space through killer satellites, directed energy weapons, and more, in an effort to exploit our systems and chip away at our military advantage.
[00:02:46.792 --> 00:02:57.015]  And for the past few years, many have wondered if these advanced weapon systems have anything to do with the unprecedented fires we have seen in the past few years.
[00:02:58.215 --> 00:03:02.276]  Laser-based weapons are able to destroy the target with external heat.
[00:03:03.216 --> 00:03:14.459]  And microwave weapons are designed to penetrate the target through external antennas and sensors and ignite the internal electronics, destroying them from the inside out.
[00:03:15.632 --> 00:03:22.677]  This could explain how thousands of homes have rapidly burned into their own footprint while the trees surrounding them survive.
[00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:33.184]  And it could explain the several cars we have seen utterly destroyed with temperatures hot enough to liquefy glass and metal.
[00:03:34.426 --> 00:03:43.088]  Michael Janich, host of the YouTube DutchSense channel, has been researching the Earth's seismic activity for the past 10 years.
[00:03:43.908 --> 00:03:52.950]  During the past few weeks, he has discovered satellite imagery that show an equal distance spread of fires, all starting within the same four hours.
[00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.710]  Four hours?
[00:03:54.450 --> 00:04:00.712]  We've got ourselves an equal distance spread of fires here, here, here, here, and here.
[00:04:02.999 --> 00:04:06.461]  So, what could cause an equal distance spread of fires?
[00:04:06.741 --> 00:04:09.043]  Well, only two things, mother nature or man, right?
[00:04:09.563 --> 00:04:10.763]  There's no storm in the area.
[00:04:10.944 --> 00:04:12.084]  You can't blame a storm.
[00:04:13.245 --> 00:04:20.689]  So, what could cause equal distance spaced fires to spread out across, what do you think that is, one-third of Idaho?
[00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:28.914]  And he also discovered what looks to be a beam of light that can be seen in the infrared spectrum, like a microwave.
[00:04:30.231 --> 00:04:35.515]  On September 8th, a beam of light can be seen directed to the Dolan Fire of California.
[00:04:36.235 --> 00:04:42.459]  The beam appears to excite the heat signature of the fire as it is held on target for over two hours.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.421]  Right before dawn, watch that.
[00:04:44.701 --> 00:04:46.943]  This is yesterday going into this morning.
[00:04:47.643 --> 00:04:54.608]  This is in California, the beam coming from space up above Oregon, or somewhere in between this and Oregon.
[00:04:55.649 --> 00:04:57.450]  And as it's going through, see how it excites?
[00:04:59.503 --> 00:05:01.284]  As the beam is spreading, look how it excites.
[00:05:01.524 --> 00:05:02.244]  It's no doubt about it.
[00:05:03.024 --> 00:05:04.064]  And the beam spreads first.
[00:05:04.465 --> 00:05:04.645]  Look.
[00:05:05.025 --> 00:05:05.785]  Beam spreads first.
[00:05:06.845 --> 00:05:11.747]  Goes from a tiny, little, tight beam to a wide beam.
[00:05:12.167 --> 00:05:14.488]  Then the fire spreads to a wide fire.
[00:05:14.668 --> 00:05:22.770]  The next day, a beam of light is seen directed at and exciting the heat signature of the Holiday Farm Fire in Oregon for over an hour.
[00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.310]  Here.
[00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.311]  Here it is now.
[00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:25.031]  And it's two of them.
[00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:27.772]  And it's only going to one fire.
[00:05:28.152 --> 00:05:28.812]  A different fire.
[00:05:30.168 --> 00:05:30.808]  And it's moving.
[00:05:30.828 --> 00:05:33.069]  Okay, it's moving.
[00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:38.772]  There's clouds going through it, which rules out it being an artifact.
[00:05:38.812 --> 00:05:43.134]  The clouds are passing through and interfering with the beam.
[00:05:43.714 --> 00:05:49.437]  Meanwhile, in space, Moscow and Beijing have turned a once peaceful arena into a warfighting domain.
[00:05:50.236 --> 00:05:59.021]  They have weaponized space through killer satellites, directed energy weapons, and more, in an effort to exploit our systems and chip away at our military advantage.
[00:05:59.341 --> 00:06:02.002]  The timing of this public admission is interesting.
[00:06:02.623 --> 00:06:05.724]  These weapons of the future are now officially being deployed.
[00:06:06.605 --> 00:06:09.567]  Are we currently being attacked with directed energy weapons?
[00:06:10.427 --> 00:06:11.868]  And if so, by who?
[00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:15.610]  For InfoWars.com, this is Greg Reese.
[00:06:21.195 --> 00:06:21.595]  Not Biden.
[00:06:21.736 --> 00:06:25.719]  Klobuchar and others back then were saying, hey, you've got to have a full bench.
[00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:26.700]  You've got to have a full bench.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:31.144]  Because of what the Republicans did in 2016.
[00:06:31.345 --> 00:06:32.646]  Democrats didn't do that in 2016.
[00:06:33.286 --> 00:06:37.450]  If Democrats actually put the person, wanted the person that was in office now,
[00:06:38.651 --> 00:06:40.013]  They would be making the same choice.
[00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:42.756]  They would be consistent with their principles.
[00:06:43.017 --> 00:06:43.497]  I don't know that.
[00:06:43.878 --> 00:06:44.158]  Yeah.
[00:06:44.438 --> 00:06:50.386]  And I think that most people don't agree with that idea, which is why they don't care about the difference between left and right.
[00:06:50.426 --> 00:06:56.112]  See, until you have a group of people that decide to consistently be better than what they reject,
[00:06:57.213 --> 00:07:02.174]  You're going to have people in the exact position they are right now, Don, which is no matter what happens, everybody sticks to their team.
[00:07:02.194 --> 00:07:03.635]  We're going to have to blow up the entire system.
[00:07:04.075 --> 00:07:05.115]  And you know what we're going to have to do?
[00:07:05.135 --> 00:07:05.815]  No, I don't know about that.
[00:07:05.835 --> 00:07:07.316]  You know what we're going to have to do?
[00:07:07.416 --> 00:07:07.896]  You just got to vote.
[00:07:07.916 --> 00:07:12.097]  Honestly, from what your closing argument is, you're going to have to get rid of the Electoral College.
[00:07:12.537 --> 00:07:14.037]  Because the people... I don't see it.
[00:07:14.497 --> 00:07:18.498]  Because the minority in this country decides who the judges are and they decide who the president is.
[00:07:18.518 --> 00:07:19.019]  Is that fair?
[00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:20.719]  But you need a constitutional amendment to do that.
[00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:27.541]  And if Democrats, if Joe Biden wins, Democrats can sack the courts and they can do that amendment and they can get it passed.
[00:07:27.641 --> 00:07:31.522]  Well, you need two-thirds vote in the Congress and three-quarters of the state legislature.
[00:07:31.542 --> 00:07:32.542]  They may be able to do that.
[00:07:32.642 --> 00:07:34.482]  Maybe, but that's a tall task.
[00:07:34.523 --> 00:07:39.964]  I think if people vote, if you had 80% participation in our elections... I'm in so much trouble, you know why.
[00:07:40.064 --> 00:07:40.724]  It's your show!
[00:07:40.904 --> 00:07:41.744]  What's better than this?
[00:07:41.804 --> 00:07:47.886]  Everybody, what do people say when they stop us on... CNN anchors says Democrats have to blow up the entire system.
[00:07:49.673 --> 00:07:57.595]  I want this to sink in on this Tuesday, September 22nd edition of the Alex Jones broadcast, 41 days out, Team America.
[00:07:59.355 --> 00:08:05.797]  The Democrats are openly announcing they want a physical civil war and are implementing it.
[00:08:06.537 --> 00:08:09.837]  And that civil war that they're backing is foreign backed.
[00:08:11.018 --> 00:08:13.178]  They believe the country shouldn't even exist.
[00:08:14.578 --> 00:08:15.559]  They hate the military.
[00:08:15.619 --> 00:08:16.339]  They hate police.
[00:08:17.472 --> 00:08:19.353]  Because it represents our Republic.
[00:08:19.613 --> 00:08:20.674]  They want control of them.
[00:08:20.914 --> 00:08:23.736]  Then they tell you, oh, Trump hates the military.
[00:08:23.776 --> 00:08:25.276]  Trump hates police.
[00:08:25.817 --> 00:08:28.898]  And they lie to you, and they lie to you, and they lie to you again.
[00:08:30.359 --> 00:08:34.582]  Dr. Carlson always knocks it out of the park, but he did a grand slam yesterday.
[00:08:34.602 --> 00:08:37.323]  We're going to play some of it in a moment.
[00:08:37.463 --> 00:08:42.986]  Democrats threaten to fly to Washington and prevent Senate vote on Supreme Court to the United States nomination.
[00:08:43.647 --> 00:08:45.248]  Lay down on the floor, block entry to Senate.
[00:08:45.947 --> 00:08:57.617]  We're going to play some of that in a moment, but remember, this is all just setting the stage for them to contest the election no matter what they said they will, and have Democrat states secede.
[00:08:58.318 --> 00:09:08.447]  Trump needs to directly respond to their calls for civil war, and the fact that you can say what you want about the South and the North and who was right in the civil war.
[00:09:08.627 --> 00:09:10.389]  You can see both sides, historically.
[00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:23.558]  The people breaking away from the Union did not hate America, they saw themselves as Americans, but they were setting up the real form of the Republic to control Western expansion.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:30.085]  And they shared a lot of the values of the Northerners, and they were related to each other.
[00:09:31.646 --> 00:09:32.967]  They were bound by a common history.
[00:09:34.288 --> 00:09:38.573]  When they talk about, on CNN, MSNBC, all the major colleges everywhere,
[00:09:39.616 --> 00:09:50.962]  When they have NFL games now and the one player who's a Bronze Star recipient refuses to not come out for the Star-Spangled Banner and the rest of the team stays inside, he got in trouble.
[00:09:52.422 --> 00:09:53.843]  That's 2020 America.
[00:09:54.103 --> 00:09:56.144]  The one guy that wants to go out.
[00:09:57.585 --> 00:09:59.826]  I've got the article right here in Stanford Star-Spangled Banner.
[00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:01.007]  He gets in trouble.
[00:10:01.127 --> 00:10:02.207]  I thought we were all individuals.
[00:10:02.267 --> 00:10:03.168]  I thought we all had freedom.
[00:10:03.368 --> 00:10:04.849]  But you see, you don't under this system.
[00:10:06.269 --> 00:10:09.031]  The globalists cannot compete against an American system.
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:15.044]  They cannot compete against something that makes people fabulously successful that they want to work hard.
[00:10:15.624 --> 00:10:22.750]  They cannot compete with something that challenges authoritarianism.
[00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:28.054]  Does free market Americana capitalism make us fabulously rich?
[00:10:28.094 --> 00:10:29.455]  Does it make us corrupt and decadent?
[00:10:29.515 --> 00:10:30.616]  That's the problem.
[00:10:32.157 --> 00:10:35.980]  Is that historically anytime a country or a nation or a system becomes
[00:10:37.537 --> 00:10:40.118]  Very stoic, very strong, very, very manly.
[00:10:40.859 --> 00:10:50.003]  They have a time of incredible success, then people become decadent, then corruption sets in, then they decline, and they usually collapse very spectacularly.
[00:10:51.723 --> 00:10:57.186]  And younger, more hungry cultures come in and take them over and burn it to the ground.
[00:10:58.936 --> 00:11:04.720]  Because the barbarians are always challenged by the high culture and the technology, and they know it can come back.
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:08.303]  And it took them so long to take it over, they don't want to adopt it.
[00:11:08.923 --> 00:11:09.944]  They want to burn it.
[00:11:11.605 --> 00:11:14.067]  Because that's what vandals do.
[00:11:14.087 --> 00:11:23.513]  That's why we get the term vandals from the Visigoths and the Austriagoths that poured down from north of Italy in 410 with the Germans.
[00:11:29.659 --> 00:11:30.599]  Led by Alaric.
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:35.642]  And they burned Rome to the ground.
[00:11:39.503 --> 00:11:47.087]  Except for one temple that was so spectacular, when they walked into it, they said, surely this is where the gods resigned, and they ran out.
[00:11:48.407 --> 00:11:54.630]  And so that building stands today, a thousand, five hundred plus years later.
[00:11:58.888 --> 00:12:02.951]  So there is red fire in the sky on the West Coast.
[00:12:03.852 --> 00:12:06.354]  And there is political red fire above D.C.
[00:12:06.374 --> 00:12:18.443]  And we're living in such an incredibly amazing and thought-provoking and dangerous time, but you're seeing humanity awaken, but only partially that Democrats will wreck the nation and that Democrats are bad people.
[00:12:18.823 --> 00:12:23.047]  Folks, they are sinister forces of foreign powers.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.401]  They want to totally implode the nation so they can consolidate power and control.
[00:12:28.141 --> 00:12:34.883]  And that's their own admissions so that they can get all the land, the property, the wealth, the weapons for nothing.
[00:12:36.163 --> 00:12:40.485]  And it's Chinese, communist-backed, through the globalists that control China.
[00:12:41.125 --> 00:12:48.007]  And it should be so simple for Americans to come together against this because even if you were a psychotic person,
[00:12:49.534 --> 00:13:04.298]  You would realize that for 99.99% of people, the Republic's implosion is going to be horrible culturally, horrible spiritually, horrible financially, and most people are never going to recover.
[00:13:04.878 --> 00:13:09.339]  And there's going to be blood in the streets for decades, and mass suicides, and just things that are unimaginable.
[00:13:09.899 --> 00:13:16.161]  Because if you study who we were during the Great Depression that lasted 10 years, and 7 million people starved to death, quietly and politely,
[00:13:17.421 --> 00:13:34.369]  With 90% of folks living in rural areas, you reverse those numbers, 90% living in urban areas, only half the countryside self-sufficient, 5% of the public self-sufficient, versus 50-60%, because not everybody in the country was self-sufficient.
[00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:39.431]  90% were in the country, but only about 60% they estimate were self-sufficient.
[00:13:39.791 --> 00:13:46.875]  So 60% self-sufficient, 7 million starved to death, absolute horrific conditions.
[00:13:48.069 --> 00:13:49.651]  Versus 5% self-sufficient.
[00:13:50.892 --> 00:13:53.835]  This is a doomsday scenario.
[00:13:53.935 --> 00:13:57.899]  And Communist China has been flying bombers over Taiwan and Hong Kong, threatening to attack.
[00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:01.503]  Hong Kong and Taiwan have issued statements saying they're ready to go to war.
[00:14:03.137 --> 00:14:10.403]  This is the type of political and cultural and historical climate where you get big wars.
[00:14:10.844 --> 00:14:17.369]  And all the mainline historians and analysts agree, we are right where we were at the beginning of World War I, right where we were at the beginning of World War II.
[00:14:17.769 --> 00:14:19.531]  All of the ingredients are there.
[00:14:19.711 --> 00:14:26.857]  It's kind of like a huge cold front coming in, in the fall, in the plains of Kansas.
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:31.381]  And you know in that cold air,
[00:14:34.733 --> 00:14:36.854]  It's that hot air, that 90 degree air.
[00:14:36.894 --> 00:14:37.394]  What happens?
[00:14:37.935 --> 00:14:38.495]  Tornadoes.
[00:14:38.955 --> 00:14:40.836]  So you see that big blue northern coming in.
[00:14:41.256 --> 00:14:42.697]  It's not going to get there for another day.
[00:14:42.937 --> 00:14:46.399]  But you know, get batten down the hatches, look for tornadoes.
[00:14:46.459 --> 00:14:49.820]  Back, you know, back before they had even good radar.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.802]  It'd be in the newspaper that a big blue northern came out of Canada.
[00:14:52.822 --> 00:14:53.862]  It's coming down from Illinois.
[00:14:53.882 --> 00:14:57.144]  And you know, boy, in a day or two, it's going to hit in this hot weather.
[00:14:57.184 --> 00:14:58.345]  We're going to have tornadoes.
[00:14:58.365 --> 00:15:00.966]  Well, it's the same thing here, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:01.426 --> 00:15:03.067]  You've got a perfect storm.
[00:15:05.251 --> 00:15:09.252]  of all of this stuff coming together and China putting out videos where they bomb U.S.
[00:15:09.292 --> 00:15:09.652]  cities.
[00:15:11.753 --> 00:15:16.374]  And you know they've got direct energy weapons in space, as Greg Reese's excellent report breaks down.
[00:15:16.554 --> 00:15:23.796]  And it's just a time to have our heads screwed on straight and to get on our knees to God, because this is the big one, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:26.158 --> 00:15:30.419]  His report is at Infowars.com, but it's also at Bandot Video in the Gregory section.
[00:15:30.979 --> 00:15:43.283]  Beam of light aimed at West Coast fires as Pentagon warns that China has weaponized space with direct energy weapons, destroying spacecraft, satellites in space, and attacking targets on the ground.
[00:15:45.104 --> 00:15:50.185]  Greg, a year ago, put out a report saying it looks like direct energy weapons from China, and now it's definitely feeding into it.
[00:15:50.225 --> 00:15:53.186]  They even pick up the lasers on satellite and radar.
[00:15:54.312 --> 00:15:58.754]  Because it affects the atmosphere, so the laser line picks up in the radar.
[00:15:59.114 --> 00:15:59.734]  We'll be right back.
[00:15:59.754 --> 00:16:00.194]  Stay with us.
[00:16:03.416 --> 00:16:05.477]  We are not living in normal times.
[00:16:05.517 --> 00:16:09.038]  We are not living in the year 2015, or the year 1999, or the year 1982.
[00:16:09.118 --> 00:16:14.880]  We're living in the year 2020, and it's a battle between the 1984 ideology of the New World Order and the 1776 ideology of America.
[00:16:23.817 --> 00:16:27.400]  And the worldwide authoritarians know that their system cannot survive.
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:31.143]  If freedom exists anywhere in any way, people will choose it.
[00:16:32.524 --> 00:16:44.092]  The headline of the live feed that I hope you'll share for your future in mind as well on Infowars.com and Newswars.com is Democrats officially launch foreign-backed civil war.
[00:16:46.554 --> 00:16:50.317]  CNN calls for blowing up America.
[00:16:50.677 --> 00:16:52.439]  They say blow up the American system.
[00:16:53.686 --> 00:16:54.567]  And bring in what?
[00:16:55.747 --> 00:17:01.532]  Well, we know the Council on Foreign Relations has told us thousands of times, the communist Chinese system.
[00:17:04.434 --> 00:17:09.017]  Now, coming up in the next segment, I'm going to get into the latest on the COVID-19 global power grab.
[00:17:09.977 --> 00:17:10.798]  Big developments there.
[00:17:10.838 --> 00:17:15.181]  I'm going to get into the attacks on free speech and how it's metastasizing and where it's going next.
[00:17:15.821 --> 00:17:16.722]  I'm also going to get into U.S.
[00:17:16.762 --> 00:17:20.225]  Marshals recovering 35 missing Northeastern Ohio children.
[00:17:21.271 --> 00:17:30.057]  that have been grabbed up by sex rings, and how that ties into FBI agent who found Wiener laptop with Clinton's emails, says FBI leadership ordered him to erase his filings.
[00:17:30.077 --> 00:17:38.702]  Just incredible criminal activity of that child sex ring, and more child sex ring and child porn news coming up on that front, and so much more.
[00:17:39.523 --> 00:17:43.265]  And a lot of really informative guests that I'll tell you about at the start of the next segment.
[00:17:43.285 --> 00:17:49.529]  But Tucker Carlson really is getting it, that the Democrats are bringing us into this hot civil war,
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:52.502]  And that they're going to stop at nothing.
[00:17:52.702 --> 00:17:59.847]  And of course they said they'll pack the court if Republicans don't wait till after the election.
[00:18:02.189 --> 00:18:07.874]  If the Republicans go ahead and do what the Democrats would do and anybody would do what the Constitution says and put in their nominee.
[00:18:09.264 --> 00:18:10.325]  They said they've got the votes down.
[00:18:10.365 --> 00:18:11.825]  We'll break that down as well next segment.
[00:18:12.165 --> 00:18:15.207]  But now Mitt Romney says he's going to follow the Constitution.
[00:18:15.247 --> 00:18:16.528]  Well, he's never really done that before.
[00:18:17.308 --> 00:18:22.431]  I predict Romney, once the hearings are going, is going to find some reason to remove his vote.
[00:18:22.531 --> 00:18:25.552]  He is a nasty, nasty globalist creature.
[00:18:26.953 --> 00:18:29.834]  There's nothing evil that he hasn't found that he doesn't like to back.
[00:18:32.264 --> 00:18:33.286]  That remains to be seen.
[00:18:33.807 --> 00:18:41.499]  But Tucker Carlson really gets what's going on, and it dovetails with Don Lemon saying he wants to blow up the whole system, meaning America.
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:43.001]  For who, Don Lemon?
[00:18:43.061 --> 00:18:44.744]  Oh, the Chi-Coms and the globalists, that's right.
[00:18:45.085 --> 00:18:46.287]  Here's Tucker Carlson last night.
[00:18:47.512 --> 00:18:50.817]  As you know, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died last Friday.
[00:18:50.857 --> 00:18:51.918]  She passed away of cancer.
[00:18:52.499 --> 00:18:56.284]  It was a sad moment because death is always sad, no matter who dies.
[00:18:56.825 --> 00:18:58.547]  Death is coming for all of us someday.
[00:18:58.908 --> 00:19:02.232]  For that reason, we ought to mark a person's passing with a bow of respect.
[00:19:02.813 --> 00:19:04.755]  Take a moment for humility and perspective.
[00:19:04.855 --> 00:19:09.078]  Meditate on the fragility of our own lives and the lives of those we love.
[00:19:09.619 --> 00:19:13.362]  Remember that death is the one thing that unites every human being.
[00:19:14.002 --> 00:19:18.186]  No matter how powerful we imagine we are, at some point, we will be gone.
[00:19:18.706 --> 00:19:19.126]  All of us.
[00:19:20.123 --> 00:19:28.045]  In our case, we almost never agreed with Justice Ginsburg's decisions, but on Friday night's show we did our best to show some reverence, because that's the right thing to do.
[00:19:29.025 --> 00:19:31.366]  The left, by contrast, made no attempt at all.
[00:19:31.686 --> 00:19:36.207]  Prominent progressives immediately descended into hysteria and rage, unbridled rage.
[00:19:36.787 --> 00:19:40.308]  They told us that Ruth Bader Ginsburg's death was more than sad.
[00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:44.009]  They said it was a national crisis that imperiled this country's freedoms.
[00:19:45.222 --> 00:19:51.145]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, they told us, single-handedly kept America from descending into fascism and tyranny.
[00:19:51.706 --> 00:19:54.687]  Now that she's gone, only her words can keep us safe.
[00:19:55.828 --> 00:19:57.489]  That's an odd claim, if you think about it.
[00:19:57.529 --> 00:19:59.630]  This is supposed to be a democracy.
[00:20:00.050 --> 00:20:01.931]  No one ever voted for Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
[00:20:02.211 --> 00:20:08.155]  No matter how much you liked her or agreed with her, she was, in the end, a single judge in a country of 350 million people.
[00:20:08.175 --> 00:20:08.555]  She was not God.
[00:20:11.459 --> 00:20:14.040]  Yet according to the left, Ginsburg was all we had.
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.522]  We must obey her dying words as if they were a religious text.
[00:20:18.862 --> 00:20:21.783]  Her final wish supersedes our founding documents.
[00:20:22.143 --> 00:20:23.984]  What would Ruth Bader Ginsburg do?
[00:20:24.584 --> 00:20:26.785]  We must ask ourselves that, and then do it.
[00:20:27.325 --> 00:20:27.645]  Watch.
[00:20:28.865 --> 00:20:35.248]  As a nation, we should heed her final call to us, not as a personal service to her,
[00:20:36.596 --> 00:20:40.798]  But as a service to the country, our country, at a crossroads.
[00:20:40.918 --> 00:20:41.558]  Stop it for a minute.
[00:20:41.578 --> 00:20:43.239]  Honor her last words.
[00:20:43.499 --> 00:20:44.559]  Back it up five seconds for me.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:51.162]  These are the people dismantling the country that sold us out to China and say the country shouldn't even exist.
[00:20:51.902 --> 00:20:58.405]  And by the way, Ruth Bader Ginsburg has come out that you talk to her and she'd have to wait like a minute to answer that she was almost mentally retarded.
[00:20:59.198 --> 00:21:01.519]  And part of a horrible communist think tank.
[00:21:01.579 --> 00:21:02.520]  That's why they put her in.
[00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.721]  Because she follows orders.
[00:21:04.441 --> 00:21:09.024]  It's well known, ladies and gentlemen, that she is extremely stupid.
[00:21:10.324 --> 00:21:11.505]  Bare minimum autistic.
[00:21:11.705 --> 00:21:12.886]  Nothing against autistic people.
[00:21:13.206 --> 00:21:14.627]  But that's why they want Biden in.
[00:21:14.907 --> 00:21:17.949]  Because he is a mental moron that they can control as well.
[00:21:18.249 --> 00:21:20.430]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg was a meat puppet.
[00:21:22.231 --> 00:21:23.712]  Who loved abortion.
[00:21:25.013 --> 00:21:25.853]  What about the children?
[00:21:25.873 --> 00:21:26.994]  What about them being revered?
[00:21:27.194 --> 00:21:28.295]  What about them being remembered?
[00:21:29.249 --> 00:21:32.333]  I refuse to bow at the knees of this rotting witch.
[00:21:32.573 --> 00:21:33.053]  Continue.
[00:21:35.536 --> 00:21:47.490]  As a nation, we should heed her final call to us, not as a personal service to her, but as a service to the country, our country, at a crossroads.
[00:21:48.194 --> 00:21:54.337]  Honor her last words that she not be replaced until a new president is installed.
[00:21:55.097 --> 00:22:03.362]  She said, my most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced by a new, until a new president is installed.
[00:22:04.982 --> 00:22:05.703]  We believe that.
[00:22:06.663 --> 00:22:13.707]  Her fervent wish is that the next president pick, that was the last thing she said to the public.
[00:22:14.249 --> 00:22:15.692]  We know who this man is.
[00:22:16.513 --> 00:22:17.775]  We know who this man is.
[00:22:17.795 --> 00:22:24.486]  This is a man who does not care about a dying woman's final wish.
[00:22:25.147 --> 00:22:25.668]  Clearly.
[00:22:27.702 --> 00:22:33.264]  So, turn down the volume and consider for a moment the reasoning here, the argument that they're making.
[00:22:33.824 --> 00:22:36.085]  Nothing is more important than our Constitution.
[00:22:36.525 --> 00:22:38.626]  That Constitution is in grave jeopardy.
[00:22:39.146 --> 00:22:47.970]  That's why we must substitute an 87-year-old woman's final wish for the constitutionally prescribed process for filling a Supreme Court seat.
[00:22:49.073 --> 00:22:49.914]  That's what they're arguing.
[00:22:49.934 --> 00:22:50.274]  Got that?
[00:22:51.015 --> 00:22:51.615]  Pretty amusing.
[00:22:52.276 --> 00:22:56.380]  Keep in mind we don't really know, actually, what Ruth Bader Ginsburg's final words were.
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:59.943]  Did she really leave this world fretting about a presidential election?
[00:23:00.604 --> 00:23:01.745]  We don't believe that.
[00:23:02.185 --> 00:23:05.128]  For a second, if it were true, it would be pathetic.
[00:23:06.311 --> 00:23:08.593]  Because life is bigger than politics, even this year.
[00:23:08.993 --> 00:23:12.296]  We wouldn't wish final words that small on anyone.
[00:23:12.336 --> 00:23:16.300]  So we're going to, again, choose to believe that Ruth Bader Ginsburg didn't really say that.
[00:23:16.320 --> 00:23:21.104]  That in real life, she was thinking at the end about her family and where she might be going next.
[00:23:21.484 --> 00:23:24.147]  Human concerns, not partisan ones.
[00:23:25.319 --> 00:23:27.641]  But in practical terms, it's irrelevant what she said.
[00:23:28.101 --> 00:23:31.184]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg doesn't get to pick her replacement from her deathbed.
[00:23:31.204 --> 00:23:32.465]  That's not how it works.
[00:23:32.505 --> 00:23:35.227]  We have a Constitution we're supposed to be defending, remember?
[00:23:35.267 --> 00:23:37.229]  And that's the whole point of the Constitution.
[00:23:37.969 --> 00:23:41.072]  If Justice Scalia had said something like that, nobody would have cared.
[00:23:41.392 --> 00:23:42.673]  We would have been embarrassed for him.
[00:23:43.554 --> 00:23:44.595]  Thankfully, he didn't say that.
[00:23:45.395 --> 00:23:47.177]  On some level, Democrats know all this.
[00:23:47.577 --> 00:23:53.181]  All this talk about Ginsburg's dying wish is ridiculous and insulting to all of us and our country.
[00:23:54.144 --> 00:23:54.985]  And they'll stop soon.
[00:23:55.925 --> 00:23:59.648]  Democrats have an alternative argument at the ready, and that's one they've been honing all year.
[00:23:59.688 --> 00:24:00.268]  It goes like this.
[00:24:00.848 --> 00:24:03.090]  Do what we want, or we will hurt you.
[00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.251]  That's the real argument they're making.
[00:24:05.832 --> 00:24:10.555]  Reza Aslan, a long-time CNN employee, wrote this... Alright, again, we're going to go to break.
[00:24:11.425 --> 00:24:14.686]  And we're going to come back and finish up a few minutes of this, and then I'm going to get into fact-checking.
[00:24:15.227 --> 00:24:21.769]  Ginsburg, in 2016, she said you must move forward with a nomination if someone dies, regardless.
[00:24:22.210 --> 00:24:23.970]  But of course, now she's flip-flopped on that.
[00:24:24.531 --> 00:24:25.351]  It doesn't even matter.
[00:24:25.411 --> 00:24:27.172]  These people aren't even Americans.
[00:24:27.552 --> 00:24:28.832]  They hate you.
[00:24:29.193 --> 00:24:29.913]  Don't just say that.
[00:24:29.973 --> 00:24:30.393]  You know that.
[00:24:30.573 --> 00:24:32.394]  The Democrats are Satanists.
[00:24:32.714 --> 00:24:34.375]  They hate America's existence.
[00:24:36.001 --> 00:24:40.105]  We are back live on this Tuesday, September 22nd transmission.
[00:24:40.125 --> 00:24:41.907]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:24:43.168 --> 00:24:58.263]  And I do want to open the phones up in the last segment of this hour and in the second hour, G. Edward Griffin to cover the waterfront, one of the longest living grandfathers of the whole anti-new world order movement, totally vindicated.
[00:24:59.206 --> 00:25:13.171]  He used to talk about that famous defector with a high-level KGB defector interview that he did that's gone so viral again and is part of a lot of the major discourse going on in the United States and the world.
[00:25:13.231 --> 00:25:15.111]  That is all coming up.
[00:25:15.912 --> 00:25:20.053]  And you can talk about the Democrats openly announcing they want a civil war and how they're foreign-backed.
[00:25:21.192 --> 00:25:25.776]  You can talk about COVID-19 and that whole power grab and the next phase of that already launching.
[00:25:26.496 --> 00:25:36.104]  You can get into any subject you basically want to, but I'd like to ask listeners, what should we all be doing 41 days out from this?
[00:25:36.585 --> 00:25:40.087]  Because I realized this this morning and it really clicked.
[00:25:41.769 --> 00:25:48.775]  Normally with an election, you'd have the countdown of how many days to the election, but with them saying they're going to contest it,
[00:25:49.642 --> 00:25:56.445]  And put down 80 million ballots, illegally in most cases, to confuse things and sabotage the whole system.
[00:25:58.826 --> 00:26:01.187]  Really, the countdown should be to Inauguration Day.
[00:26:01.227 --> 00:26:05.589]  So guys, you do a great job putting the countdown every day up there on screen for me.
[00:26:07.049 --> 00:26:11.391]  Can we sort of have an account down to the election, but then a countdown to January 20th?
[00:26:11.511 --> 00:26:15.073]  Because that's the real countdown here, for all the marbles.
[00:26:20.222 --> 00:26:25.385]  Election Day is important, but we know they're going to contest it.
[00:26:25.405 --> 00:26:26.406]  We know they're foreign backed.
[00:26:26.686 --> 00:26:39.355]  When you look at how weak the Democrats are, when you see how pathetic they are, when you see how their leaders aren't leaders at all and can barely talk, you're like, why are they like this?
[00:26:39.835 --> 00:26:41.316]  Because that's what traitors look like.
[00:26:43.497 --> 00:26:45.959]  The FBI reportedly talked to more than 5,000 people
[00:26:48.479 --> 00:27:00.067]  In the Mueller probe, trying to set somebody up for being a Russian agent, and they couldn't get one American to take the money, one American to sell out.
[00:27:01.808 --> 00:27:03.489]  That's because they were going after Republicans.
[00:27:03.509 --> 00:27:08.353]  And Republicans have had their problems at the leadership level, because they've been globalists.
[00:27:08.393 --> 00:27:13.837]  But now, you look at it, it's a populist nationalist movement, and the Republicans I grew up knowing at the grassroots,
[00:27:14.758 --> 00:27:18.660]  We're so straight-laced, like Leave it to Beaver's parents.
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.020]  And that's really who we are.
[00:27:21.581 --> 00:27:24.142]  Except I'm not one of those naive Leave it to Beaver people.
[00:27:25.402 --> 00:27:30.744]  I live my life pretty much like Leave it to Beaver's dad, but I'm not naive about the system.
[00:27:31.264 --> 00:27:33.185]  And I won't be trampled on and run over.
[00:27:34.886 --> 00:27:40.328]  Now, imagine if the FBI went to the Democrats and offered them millions of dollars.
[00:27:42.216 --> 00:27:43.797]  To sell their country out to the Russians.
[00:27:44.758 --> 00:27:52.564]  They would have gotten most Democrats to take the money in a split second because they hate America.
[00:27:52.664 --> 00:27:53.685]  It's their religion.
[00:27:53.885 --> 00:27:54.466]  I'm going to say that again.
[00:27:55.547 --> 00:28:08.017]  They estimate between four and eight thousand people were interviewed that the FBI, the special task forces, offered thousands of people money posing as Russians after Trump was elected trying to find something and they could find nothing.
[00:28:10.794 --> 00:28:30.223]  They had to take CIA agents they knew, who were ordered to infiltrate the Russians, knowing they couldn't blow their cover under federal law, to then set up a few CIA assets and agents, operatives, actual agents, so they could have somebody that talked to a Russian.
[00:28:31.411 --> 00:28:33.232]  Meanwhile, China owns the debt.
[00:28:33.292 --> 00:28:34.093]  It owns Hollywood.
[00:28:34.953 --> 00:28:39.736]  Nancy Pelosi and all of them hide it in plain view and say, we want Biden.
[00:28:40.056 --> 00:28:41.157]  China wants Biden.
[00:28:41.357 --> 00:28:45.379]  And Biden says China should be involved in every aspect of American life.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:50.903]  From our work, to our schools, to our churches, to our sporting events.
[00:28:51.643 --> 00:28:52.924]  Every facet of our culture.
[00:28:53.084 --> 00:28:58.247]  He literally gets on his knees beyond Benedict Arnold and does that.
[00:29:00.794 --> 00:29:03.236]  If we were back in 1939, he'd salute Hitler.
[00:29:04.677 --> 00:29:09.181]  That's the level of quizzling enemy of humanity.
[00:29:09.221 --> 00:29:11.443]  I mean, these people are flaming enemies.
[00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:14.206]  They are outrageous pieces of garbage.
[00:29:14.246 --> 00:29:25.195]  They are so absolutely out in the open, and our media is bought and paid for by the same groups, and so they just sit there, hating the very nation's existence.
[00:29:26.206 --> 00:29:29.767]  Yeah, they just charged a NYPD officer for spying for China.
[00:29:29.827 --> 00:29:30.827]  It's everywhere, folks.
[00:29:32.088 --> 00:29:36.789]  But they couldn't get one American, including me.
[00:29:37.429 --> 00:29:38.409]  And I'm not at liberty to get into it.
[00:29:40.430 --> 00:29:46.751]  They couldn't get one American to take the money.
[00:29:49.452 --> 00:29:52.433]  I mean, I obviously knew it was a complete joke when it went down and what was going on.
[00:29:55.051 --> 00:29:56.672]  Man, I tell you folks, this is so horrible.
[00:29:57.992 --> 00:30:00.113]  And then they criminally investigated my father?
[00:30:02.674 --> 00:30:04.095]  That's the real world, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:30:04.115 --> 00:30:06.256]  They went after my family, and I told them, burn in hell.
[00:30:06.296 --> 00:30:07.437]  I don't care, go ahead and arrest us all.
[00:30:08.177 --> 00:30:09.058]  F you, burn in hell!
[00:30:10.938 --> 00:30:11.679]  I'll piss on you!
[00:30:13.046 --> 00:30:15.948]  But that's why it's so important that Trump get reelected.
[00:30:16.488 --> 00:30:28.596]  That's why it's so important we hold the course because this country is two minutes from destruction and total annihilation and war in the streets and everything we've built flushed down the toilet by a bunch of America-hating trash.
[00:30:28.797 --> 00:30:35.621]  But I'll tell you this, it's time to stop kissing the ass of Black Lives Matter and George Soros and Antifa and all these criminal organizations.
[00:30:35.801 --> 00:30:39.764]  And it's time to stop bowing to political correctness to always prove, oh, we're not racist.
[00:30:40.004 --> 00:30:40.644]  We're not bad.
[00:30:40.684 --> 00:30:43.046]  Let us bow to whatever new outrageous crap
[00:30:43.386 --> 00:30:43.926]  No!
[00:30:44.326 --> 00:30:47.808]  Now they've got checkpoints set up on the highways.
[00:30:51.449 --> 00:30:57.211]  Telling us, with random antifa shooting people in the head, saying, raise your fist, say Black Lives Matter.
[00:30:57.351 --> 00:30:57.931]  Black Lives Matter.
[00:30:58.171 --> 00:30:59.491]  I said say it louder!
[00:30:59.511 --> 00:31:01.352]  That's a damn cult!
[00:31:04.473 --> 00:31:08.414]  I'm not living on my knees, and I'm sure as hell not bowing down to these commie trash.
[00:31:08.694 --> 00:31:10.135]  They're trying to destroy their own country.
[00:31:11.357 --> 00:31:14.099]  Let's finish up with what Tucker was doing where he talks about them getting into violence.
[00:31:14.119 --> 00:31:15.900]  We'll come back, then I'll get into all the news.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.141]  I said I would, and I'll give the number out again.
[00:31:18.161 --> 00:31:18.201]  877-789-2539.
[00:31:18.221 --> 00:31:18.521]  877-789-2539.
[00:31:18.541 --> 00:31:18.581]  877-789-2539.
[00:31:18.602 --> 00:31:18.722]  Alex?
[00:31:18.742 --> 00:31:18.802]  877-789-2539.
[00:31:18.842 --> 00:31:19.862]  Let's do first-time callers today.
[00:31:19.882 --> 00:31:21.703]  Four of you were on hold yesterday when the show ended.
[00:31:21.743 --> 00:31:27.447]  Let's go ahead and finish up with Tucker Carlson laying out the Democrats going into terror mode.
[00:31:37.418 --> 00:31:48.623]  Reza Aslan, a long-time CNN employee, wrote this in the hours after Ginsburg died, quote, If they even try to replace RBG, we burn the entire effing thing down.
[00:31:49.583 --> 00:31:52.704]  That effing thing being our country that we built.
[00:31:54.165 --> 00:32:00.868]  On Friday night, another Democrat tweeted instructions for how to begin that process, quote, We're now walking to Mitch McConnell's house to protest.
[00:32:01.718 --> 00:32:05.863]  More than 120,000 people liked that post, shockingly.
[00:32:06.424 --> 00:32:09.307]  The follow-up came a few minutes later, quote, That's not a protest.
[00:32:21.343 --> 00:32:22.104]  That's a threat.
[00:32:22.884 --> 00:32:25.846]  The point of it was to terrorize Mitch McConnell and his family.
[00:32:26.006 --> 00:32:28.908]  McConnell knew it was coming because that's how things seem to work now.
[00:32:29.568 --> 00:32:32.350]  The police guarding his house are probably the only reason it's still standing.
[00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:33.091]  Watch.
[00:32:34.652 --> 00:32:35.992]  Vote him out!
[00:32:36.453 --> 00:32:37.834]  Vote him out!
[00:32:38.294 --> 00:32:40.555]  Vote him out!
[00:32:40.615 --> 00:32:42.016]  Vote him out!
[00:32:42.056 --> 00:32:42.897]  We were fine!
[00:32:56.809 --> 00:32:58.171]  We shouldn't be surprised by that.
[00:32:58.191 --> 00:33:03.135]  It was just last year that another group of Democrats gathered outside Mitch McConnell's home chanting death threats.
[00:33:03.796 --> 00:33:04.857]  It was all on video.
[00:33:05.698 --> 00:33:08.240]  We put up with it, of course, so it's happened again.
[00:33:08.441 --> 00:33:09.922]  You get what you put up with.
[00:33:10.302 --> 00:33:12.084]  That's true of children, it's true of countries.
[00:33:12.645 --> 00:33:14.887]  And we're putting up with this so we shouldn't be surprised.
[00:33:15.998 --> 00:33:16.578]  Who's doing it?
[00:33:17.099 --> 00:33:19.441]  Well, Trump voters are fascists, they tell us.
[00:33:19.901 --> 00:33:24.044]  But when was the last time Trump voters threatened Democratic politicians in their homes?
[00:33:24.064 --> 00:33:25.585]  It's hard to recall that happening.
[00:33:26.126 --> 00:33:26.326]  No.
[00:33:26.906 --> 00:33:30.769]  The tactics are always the same, and it's always the same people doing it.
[00:33:31.770 --> 00:33:37.756]  Then in case Mitch McConnell didn't get the message, Biden voters assemble at the home of Senator Lindsey Graham.
[00:33:37.796 --> 00:33:39.638]  Graham chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee.
[00:33:40.438 --> 00:33:43.141]  And then he goes on how they're pledging to fly to D.C.
[00:33:43.201 --> 00:33:48.166]  and burn everything down and block all the buildings and we told you that's coming and Soros is the main funder of that group.
[00:33:48.888 --> 00:33:50.929]  The Election Transition Integrity Group.
[00:33:51.589 --> 00:33:59.253]  When we come back though, I'm going to hit the other issues, the COVID-19, the big role out there, because I told you they're never going to end the lockdown.
[00:33:59.793 --> 00:34:00.633]  This is their move.
[00:34:00.793 --> 00:34:02.314]  It's never ending until we end it.
[00:34:03.515 --> 00:34:06.196]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[00:34:06.896 --> 00:34:08.397]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[00:34:08.877 --> 00:34:10.118]  Is your city too safe?
[00:34:12.594 --> 00:34:13.575]  Well, not anymore.
[00:34:14.315 --> 00:34:16.196]  Introducing Democrats.
[00:34:16.736 --> 00:34:24.860]  Politicians so incompetent, they'll fill your neighborhood with riots, looting, rampant violence, and even homelessness.
[00:34:25.701 --> 00:34:29.883]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old-fashioned stupidity.
[00:34:30.723 --> 00:34:32.744]  No more pesky law and order.
[00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:35.606]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[00:34:36.824 --> 00:34:41.388]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back, and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground!
[00:34:42.168 --> 00:34:42.689]  But wait!
[00:34:43.089 --> 00:34:51.296]  Vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes, and more taxes!
[00:34:51.976 --> 00:34:55.079]  Democrats, bringing chaos right to your front door!
[00:34:57.160 --> 00:34:58.822]  And that video is called Democrats.
[00:34:59.342 --> 00:35:03.125]  Please ask the great crew that put that together to make it the featured video at band.video.
[00:35:04.875 --> 00:35:13.260]  And let's make sure that we put that into a lot of the other videos we upload each day, that the great listeners go to Bandot Video and find out which they think is most important, and then you share them.
[00:35:13.641 --> 00:35:14.801]  And that's how we get around the censors.
[00:35:14.841 --> 00:35:15.462]  It's how we win.
[00:35:17.183 --> 00:35:17.483]  Okay.
[00:35:18.424 --> 00:35:20.625]  I can sit here and raise the alarm.
[00:35:20.725 --> 00:35:23.247]  I can sit here and scream and yell, and I do do that.
[00:35:24.728 --> 00:35:27.089]  But it's probably more effective just to be very calm and lay this out.
[00:35:27.149 --> 00:35:29.571]  But I just want to explain this again to new listeners.
[00:35:30.558 --> 00:35:33.100]  There's probably two niggas you've heard of Alex Jones being demonized.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.200]  You want to find out what it's all about.
[00:35:35.301 --> 00:35:37.243]  It's way worse than I can even tell you, okay?
[00:35:37.403 --> 00:35:42.726]  So, that's my frustration, is I feel guilty that I'm not doing a good enough job describing how bad these people are.
[00:35:44.127 --> 00:35:45.948]  It took me a long time to figure out how bad they are.
[00:35:46.008 --> 00:35:49.851]  I mean, I just, they're so bad, it makes your head spin.
[00:35:49.891 --> 00:35:51.112]  But it's because they have no bottom.
[00:35:51.172 --> 00:35:55.095]  These people just... A lot of these people are very stupid.
[00:35:55.335 --> 00:35:56.656]  I think stupidity goes along with
[00:35:57.498 --> 00:35:58.198]  General evil.
[00:35:58.719 --> 00:36:06.823]  Now there's some smart evil people in control of them, but the average leftist is just a lazy, drug addict, devil worshiper.
[00:36:08.544 --> 00:36:13.446]  And by that, they reject God, and they love death, and they love discord, and they take no responsibility.
[00:36:15.167 --> 00:36:16.508]  And I guess I know why they do that.
[00:36:17.648 --> 00:36:19.769]  I remember back when I didn't feel as much responsibility.
[00:36:22.911 --> 00:36:24.272]  I did have more fun sometimes.
[00:36:24.292 --> 00:36:26.573]  I mean, I was not an evil person, but I
[00:36:27.927 --> 00:36:33.010]  Got into ego and got into, you know, triumphs and got into little side issues.
[00:36:34.491 --> 00:36:39.793]  And I got a little ignorant, you know, side, side rabbit trails.
[00:36:40.574 --> 00:36:49.899]  I mean, once you really know how the world works, it is a weight, but you understand things better and there's a lot of other good things that come with it.
[00:36:50.822 --> 00:36:53.103]  And you really have a consciousness and you're a lot smarter.
[00:36:53.823 --> 00:37:01.785]  But with it, it is very, very frustrating to watch how many people are completely ignorant and they get off on being ignorant.
[00:37:01.845 --> 00:37:03.046]  I mean, take COVID-19.
[00:37:04.066 --> 00:37:19.771]  Operation Lockstep, Rockefeller, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation plan to bring in world government, to bring in casual societies, to bring in tracking apps and to bring in forced inoculation and to make you take vaccines that are on record designed to lower your fertility and give you cancer.
[00:37:20.788 --> 00:37:30.878]  And so we knew when they said 15 days to slow the spread and to leave the hospitals open that they would never take the handcuffs off.
[00:37:30.898 --> 00:37:34.061]  And then every time you get pissed, they say just a few more weeks, a few more months.
[00:37:34.542 --> 00:37:38.365]  And then right before that happens, oh, the cases are spiking.
[00:37:38.826 --> 00:37:40.067]  We can't do that now.
[00:37:41.408 --> 00:37:43.711]  And so Australia's like, we're going to take some of the restrictions off.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.441]  Oh, sorry, couldn't do it.
[00:37:45.661 --> 00:37:46.021]  Spain.
[00:37:46.362 --> 00:37:47.783]  Oh, take restrictions off for a few weeks.
[00:37:48.063 --> 00:37:49.304]  Oh, sorry, they're right back on.
[00:37:49.925 --> 00:37:51.586]  And the same thing's being done here in the United States.
[00:37:51.626 --> 00:37:52.667]  And it's not about the deaths.
[00:37:53.448 --> 00:37:54.348]  The deaths are way down.
[00:37:55.389 --> 00:37:59.693]  Because people now know that they shouldn't be putting on the list someone that died from a car wreck or something else.
[00:38:03.676 --> 00:38:07.519]  And so it's the same thing here, yet again, over and over again.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:12.364]  Oh, the stock market's down because Trump didn't handle the markets right.
[00:38:13.547 --> 00:38:17.911]  And, you know, Trump didn't stop COVID correctly.
[00:38:21.795 --> 00:38:23.216]  And now the winter is going to begin.
[00:38:23.837 --> 00:38:28.721]  We're already into the fall, and they're going to have all those flu and all those pneumonia deaths of people that don't have enough vitamin D3.
[00:38:30.302 --> 00:38:39.851]  And they're going to all say it's COVID, and then use that as the excuse to lock everything down, even though they said 2.5 million would be dead, and it's only 200,000, and again, most of those died of something else.
[00:38:40.552 --> 00:38:41.012]  U.S.
[00:38:41.113 --> 00:38:47.359]  suffers most new COVID-19 cases in five weeks, as doctors warn of apocalyptic fall.
[00:38:47.899 --> 00:38:49.881]  Remember six months ago, everything was apocalyptic.
[00:38:49.901 --> 00:38:51.623]  That was the word, apocalyptic, apocalyptic.
[00:38:51.923 --> 00:38:52.243]  And now?
[00:38:53.166 --> 00:38:55.668]  And there's always, oh, a baby died, oh.
[00:38:56.068 --> 00:39:01.872]  It turns out the baby was born without a brain, with holes in their heart, with the intestines on the outside of their body.
[00:39:02.692 --> 00:39:05.234]  They never died of COVID, they just lied to get the money at the hospital.
[00:39:07.575 --> 00:39:13.459]  Congressional report concludes China could easily have prevented the pandemic and lied about it being airborne.
[00:39:15.441 --> 00:39:15.821]  But again,
[00:39:17.273 --> 00:39:21.376]  It is man-made so Gates can own it, so it'll scare researchers when they look at it.
[00:39:21.857 --> 00:39:22.477]  But that's it.
[00:39:22.958 --> 00:39:29.523]  It's meant to spread to then make you a criminal, make you someone that can be rounded up and taken away.
[00:39:29.763 --> 00:39:31.884]  That's really the endgame of this, which is now happening.
[00:39:32.785 --> 00:39:33.626]  They're coming door to door.
[00:39:34.807 --> 00:39:35.307]  In Houston.
[00:39:36.908 --> 00:39:37.429]  In Atlanta.
[00:39:38.730 --> 00:39:39.270]  In New York.
[00:39:40.731 --> 00:39:41.212]  In Trenton.
[00:39:42.313 --> 00:39:42.893]  In Chicago.
[00:39:43.874 --> 00:39:44.314]  In Detroit.
[00:39:45.815 --> 00:39:46.436]  In Los Angeles.
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:49.141]  In Oakland.
[00:39:50.102 --> 00:39:50.622]  In Seattle.
[00:39:51.263 --> 00:39:51.724]  In Portland.
[00:39:52.144 --> 00:39:52.945]  Everywhere the same thing.
[00:39:57.350 --> 00:39:57.871]  Continuing.
[00:39:58.231 --> 00:40:02.937]  Oh, professor under investigation for calling COVID-19 the Chinese virus.
[00:40:02.977 --> 00:40:04.379]  An Infowars.com article.
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:07.803]  The Cincinnati professor, John Uecker.
[00:40:09.212 --> 00:40:10.033]  And it's the same thing here.
[00:40:10.453 --> 00:40:15.116]  In stunning reversal, CDC says it published new guidance of risk of airborne COVID-19 in air.
[00:40:15.437 --> 00:40:19.840]  Of course, regular cold viruses or flu can be carried in the air in a water droplet.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.101]  That's all known!
[00:40:22.642 --> 00:40:37.173]  But because China said eight months ago through the WHO that it wasn't airborne, we have to follow China and the UN that are the boss, and it says right here, yet the WHO refused these overtures, and this week successfully convinced the CDC
[00:40:38.479 --> 00:40:39.119]  To do the same.
[00:40:39.559 --> 00:40:50.181]  China and the WHO, the AP is reporting, are the reason that they now say it's not airborne, and quote, hurt the credibility of the CDC.
[00:40:50.701 --> 00:40:54.422]  Why the hell is the WHO in charge of the CDC?
[00:40:54.622 --> 00:40:56.022]  How are they in charge of Big Tech?
[00:40:56.342 --> 00:40:58.642]  Because it's world government, ladies and gentlemen!
[00:41:00.843 --> 00:41:02.723]  So the professor can't say Chinese virus.
[00:41:03.803 --> 00:41:08.044]  The CDC and Redfield, all of them have to take their orders
[00:41:09.639 --> 00:41:14.652]  When, of course, COVID-19's airborne, and so are all the other coronaviruses, and so's the flu virus.
[00:41:14.872 --> 00:41:15.714]  They're all airborne.
[00:41:17.534 --> 00:41:21.837]  They've got different studies on different viruses, but they live a few minutes to a few hours to a few days.
[00:41:22.197 --> 00:41:27.361]  And coronaviruses are very weak in the air, and they die in 25 seconds in direct sunlight.
[00:41:27.841 --> 00:41:29.462]  About two minutes in partial sunlight.
[00:41:29.602 --> 00:41:35.826]  But you can't say that because the UN says it's not true, even though it's been known fact for 70, 80 years!
[00:41:36.927 --> 00:41:39.189]  How do we know what temperature water boils at?
[00:41:39.389 --> 00:41:39.889]  We know.
[00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:42.371]  How do we know what temperature water freezes at?
[00:41:42.451 --> 00:41:42.971]  We know.
[00:41:43.372 --> 00:41:45.873]  How do we know how long a virus lasts in the sunlight?
[00:41:46.053 --> 00:41:46.514]  We know.
[00:41:50.029 --> 00:41:52.631]  But it's like a new dark age where people are so dumb.
[00:41:53.011 --> 00:41:54.672]  Oh, we can't say UV light kill.
[00:41:54.812 --> 00:41:55.793]  You can't go to the beach.
[00:41:55.993 --> 00:41:57.414]  That's where the virus is the worst.
[00:42:01.637 --> 00:42:05.560]  Yeah, Forbes, why speaking English may spread more coronavirus than other languages?
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:06.741]  I'm not joking, folks.
[00:42:06.981 --> 00:42:07.561]  That's Forbes.
[00:42:07.581 --> 00:42:08.402]  That's not The Onion.
[00:42:09.603 --> 00:42:10.683]  And I told you this was coming.
[00:42:10.944 --> 00:42:12.725]  CDC says breathing is bad.
[00:42:13.125 --> 00:42:15.086]  Humans living is spreading coronavirus.
[00:42:16.047 --> 00:42:16.748]  And it gets worse.
[00:42:16.788 --> 00:42:18.269]  I mentioned this ghoulish fraud.
[00:42:19.923 --> 00:42:27.225]  The youngest C-19 victim in Michigan actually died of birth defect where the baby is born with intestines located on the outside of the body.
[00:42:28.725 --> 00:42:31.766]  And even old CNN had to do a little retracty tracker.
[00:42:33.186 --> 00:42:33.566]  There it is.
[00:42:33.626 --> 00:42:34.566]  Breathing is now bad.
[00:42:37.107 --> 00:42:41.648]  CDC said it mistakenly published guidance that COVID-19 was airborne, but when the U.N.
[00:42:41.688 --> 00:42:43.768]  said that they were wrong, yes sir, Mr.
[00:42:44.288 --> 00:42:44.408]  U.N.! !
[00:42:47.958 --> 00:42:48.979]  Don't worry, it gets crazier.
[00:42:49.159 --> 00:42:50.079]  You heard breathing's bad.
[00:42:50.099 --> 00:42:57.682]  Remember in Godfather 2 where the guy's got the pilla trying to smother the other mob boss?
[00:42:58.383 --> 00:42:58.643]  Whatever?
[00:42:59.283 --> 00:43:01.804]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that is not smothering someone.
[00:43:02.244 --> 00:43:03.765]  That is resuscitating them.
[00:43:04.105 --> 00:43:06.206]  That is someone being given CPR.
[00:43:06.286 --> 00:43:06.887]  I'm not joking.
[00:43:07.287 --> 00:43:14.230]  UK government says you give someone CPR by holding a cloth over their face and covering their nose and mouth.
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:18.921]  And you go, well that's crazy!
[00:43:19.141 --> 00:43:20.482]  It's all supposed to be crazy!
[00:43:20.643 --> 00:43:28.808]  Like having convicted pedophiles come to your public school with erections through their pants and gyrate little girls and boys on them.
[00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:31.150]  Here, let me help you.
[00:43:31.170 --> 00:43:32.791]  We're gonna put this over your face.
[00:43:34.613 --> 00:43:35.653]  That's the new thing, folks.
[00:43:35.693 --> 00:43:37.595]  That's how you administer CPR.
[00:43:40.034 --> 00:43:41.716]  It's a war on logic.
[00:43:41.837 --> 00:43:42.417]  It's a cult.
[00:43:42.518 --> 00:43:43.239]  Alright, we're going to go to break.
[00:43:43.259 --> 00:43:43.920]  We're going to come back.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:44.881]  We're going to go to your phone calls.
[00:43:44.901 --> 00:43:46.223]  I'm going to get into all the other news.
[00:43:46.503 --> 00:43:47.304]  Please don't forget.
[00:43:48.646 --> 00:43:49.306]  That I have.
[00:43:49.427 --> 00:43:50.667]  Well, you can't forget.
[00:43:50.707 --> 00:43:51.388]  I haven't told you yet.
[00:43:51.808 --> 00:43:56.671]  They haven't put it up yet, but they said they're going to reset the timer and do it again because of such demand.
[00:43:56.731 --> 00:43:58.573]  Prepare with Alex.com.
[00:43:58.593 --> 00:44:06.318]  Within the next few hours, we'll have the biggest sales anywhere on the highest quality, affordable food you're going to find with prepare with Alex.com.

[00:44:14.884 --> 00:44:16.425]  You heard the God Fauci say it.
[00:44:16.825 --> 00:44:17.445]  Vitamin D3 with K.
[00:44:18.826 --> 00:44:22.852]  For your immune system in general, for living on planet Earth, you must have it.

[00:44:31.423 --> 00:44:33.266]  Infowarshore.com, because the fall is here.
[00:44:34.872 --> 00:44:38.233]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[00:44:38.253 --> 00:44:39.413]  They're going to contest the election.
[00:44:39.433 --> 00:44:40.974]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[00:44:41.174 --> 00:44:42.554]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[00:44:42.654 --> 00:44:43.674]  I want them shut down.
[00:44:43.734 --> 00:44:44.615]  I want them silenced.
[00:44:44.695 --> 00:44:45.375]  I want them muted.
[00:44:45.415 --> 00:44:47.295]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[00:44:47.335 --> 00:44:48.276]  You kept us on air.
[00:44:48.396 --> 00:44:49.696]  We did the analysis first.
[00:44:49.956 --> 00:44:50.956]  It's now gone mainstream.
[00:44:51.036 --> 00:44:52.837]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[00:44:53.117 --> 00:44:59.019]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[00:44:59.239 --> 00:45:00.679]  And you need to stop right now.
[00:45:00.779 --> 00:45:01.819]  And they're very, very serious.
[00:45:01.999 --> 00:45:04.300]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:05.280]  This is not going to happen.
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:07.200]  So they are moving now to destroy me.
[00:45:07.641 --> 00:45:08.761]  I used to say support InfoWars.
[00:45:09.201 --> 00:45:10.101]  Rescue InfoWars.
[00:45:10.181 --> 00:45:10.841]  Save yourself.
[00:45:11.181 --> 00:45:11.841]  Save the world.
[00:45:12.161 --> 00:45:13.021]  We're in this together.
[00:45:13.342 --> 00:45:14.742]  Because let me tell you something.
[00:45:14.762 --> 00:45:15.762]  Communism's up here.
[00:45:15.962 --> 00:45:18.902]  InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[00:45:19.303 --> 00:45:21.123]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[00:45:21.323 --> 00:45:22.863]  My children are right here.
[00:45:23.603 --> 00:45:25.364]  But I need money to fight a war.
[00:45:25.544 --> 00:45:26.604]  And I need word of mouth.
[00:45:26.824 --> 00:45:27.944]  And I need prayer.
[00:45:27.964 --> 00:45:28.824]  And I need action.
[00:45:29.204 --> 00:45:30.784]  Because that dam's going to come down.
[00:45:31.505 --> 00:45:33.445]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[00:45:34.085 --> 00:45:39.167]  We are now into our number two broadcast in worldwide.
[00:45:42.229 --> 00:45:42.649]  Woo!
[00:45:43.209 --> 00:45:45.550]  How many times must I tell you?
[00:45:47.071 --> 00:45:48.272]  We finally crossed those bridges.
[00:45:48.292 --> 00:45:50.953]  And now I can talk to the boss.
[00:45:51.433 --> 00:45:51.853]  That means you.
[00:45:52.274 --> 00:45:54.655]  And I can talk to the president.
[00:45:54.715 --> 00:45:55.535]  That means you.
[00:45:56.356 --> 00:45:56.896]  We the people.
[00:45:58.527 --> 00:45:59.507]  Well, I could talk to the boss.
[00:45:59.968 --> 00:46:02.449]  This is a very important report about the COVID tyranny.
[00:46:02.849 --> 00:46:06.291]  We're going to go on a break and come back with your phone calls on this live Tuesday edition.
[00:46:06.311 --> 00:46:06.991]  Please stay with us.
[00:46:08.512 --> 00:46:24.640]  We knew the Rockefeller Foundation and the Bill and Melinda Gates group and John Hopkins and all these other groups were developing injectable vaccines, nanotech, little bitty microchips, because they can miniaturize stuff so much now, that go with the vaccine.
[00:46:25.236 --> 00:46:31.401]  That's why researchers in Singapore have developed a chip which can be plugged into an existing DNA analysis machine.
[00:46:31.881 --> 00:46:40.328]  As a result, a single sample from a patient, perhaps a saliva or a blood sample, can be checked for 70,000 different viruses and bacteria.
[00:46:40.889 --> 00:46:43.351]  Each of these tests currently costs between $20 and $200.
[00:46:43.391 --> 00:46:45.773]  So to be able to do the lot for just $450 represents a massive advance.
[00:46:49.756 --> 00:46:52.918]  I love gadgets, and now I kind of feel like I'm a gadget myself.
[00:46:53.338 --> 00:46:56.360]  Even a car door can be tweaked to open with a touch.
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:47:01.723]  But each touch leaves a digital footprint, and that can compromise privacy.
[00:47:01.903 --> 00:47:13.210]  Many of the employees, including the CEO, will voluntarily have the microchips implanted into their bodies, and they're calling it, I'm not kidding here, a chips and salsa party.
[00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:19.073]  This has been announced by major universities, this is all over the news, on DrugsReport.com last night.
[00:47:19.533 --> 00:47:28.777]  My wife tweeted this, and people are like, this isn't true, this couldn't be happening, because they have that pre-built-in disposition that, oh, there's no way that could actually be going on.
[00:47:29.237 --> 00:47:34.720]  You know, Alexa's not listening to us, Google Assist isn't listening to us, now they admit it is, you're like, okay, well that's fine.
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:40.682]  DARPA-funded implantable biochip to detect COVID-19 could hit markets in 2021.
[00:47:42.230 --> 00:47:45.851]  But all the tests are fake, 90% false positives.
[00:47:45.932 --> 00:47:47.392]  It's just the excuse to get a chip in you.
[00:47:47.692 --> 00:47:48.713]  You ever wondered how they do it?
[00:47:48.793 --> 00:47:49.213]  Here it is.
[00:47:49.513 --> 00:47:53.975]  They have another digital chip that's injective, it's liquid, you can't get out of your body.
[00:47:54.055 --> 00:47:55.115]  So you can always cut a chip out.
[00:47:55.215 --> 00:47:56.376]  Oh no, sorry, this is nanotech.
[00:47:57.196 --> 00:48:00.297]  That surveils whether you've had the vaccine.
[00:48:01.158 --> 00:48:06.140]  CDC going door-to-door in Atlanta asking for blood samples for coronavirus study.
[00:48:06.740 --> 00:48:08.861]  Now, I saw this this week in Houston.
[00:48:10.259 --> 00:48:10.920]  I talked about it.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:11.921]  It was a big controversy.
[00:48:13.222 --> 00:48:16.686]  They had Snopes, fact-checkers, and people saying it's made up, doesn't exist.
[00:48:17.166 --> 00:48:21.631]  This first notice we got from someone said, Well, that is false.
[00:48:21.671 --> 00:48:22.892]  The CDC is not allowing that.
[00:48:28.718 --> 00:48:37.260]  Sean, the CDC were hitting the pavement tonight here in Candler Park, where the neighbourhood was happy to welcome them in, but many online saying they wouldn't have a bar of it.
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:44.862]  Officials randomly selecting houses and drawing blood for antibodies and conducting a questionnaire to better understand the deadly virus's spread.
[00:48:45.062 --> 00:48:47.023]  Jordan Bear was one of the first to be tested.
[00:48:47.583 --> 00:48:51.429]  Normally wouldn't have opened the door, but I looked outside and saw some folks in some PPE gear.
[00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:55.214]  One of them had a clipboard with CDC visible on it.
[00:48:55.495 --> 00:48:56.797]  And Trump doesn't have orange hair.
[00:48:56.837 --> 00:48:57.518]  That doesn't exist either.
[00:48:57.918 --> 00:48:59.440]  Well, turns out it's in Atlanta.
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:00.121]  It's everywhere.
[00:49:00.181 --> 00:49:01.043]  We have the articles.
[00:49:01.363 --> 00:49:03.927]  We have the videos showing the blood draws at the houses.
[00:49:04.127 --> 00:49:13.336]  CDC will be knocking on doors this week asking for blood samples to get a better understanding of how many Georgians have already had coronavirus.
[00:49:13.797 --> 00:49:19.723]  The homes will be randomly selected across Fulton and DeKalb counties from tomorrow through next Monday.
[00:49:19.803 --> 00:49:28.171]  Alright, you may be a little thrown off by this, but if you get a knock on the door, expect to answer a few questions and provide a blood sample to be tested for antibodies.
[00:49:28.371 --> 00:49:34.273]  MSM welcomes whistleblowers reporting party college students breaking COVID-19 reports.
[00:49:34.874 --> 00:49:40.676]  But Democrats don't want you reporting Black Lives Matter million-person marches or anything like that.
[00:49:40.756 --> 00:49:41.576]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:49:41.937 --> 00:49:46.618]  It's only just random people or any conservative groups or Trump rallies have to be shut down.
[00:49:46.638 --> 00:49:51.921]  A professor who told students she hopes Trump supporters catch COVID and die has been suspended.
[00:49:51.941 --> 00:49:53.121]  You can't argue with them.
[00:49:53.141 --> 00:49:54.542]  You can't talk sense into them.
[00:49:58.152 --> 00:50:00.793]  I said to somebody yesterday, I hope they all die before the election.
[00:50:01.134 --> 00:50:08.697]  There is a real man-made virus, so people get scared, so virologists see it and get scared, and so Bill Gates can then own it with his sub-companies and come up with a vaccine for it.
[00:50:09.658 --> 00:50:10.418]  That's all real.
[00:50:20.163 --> 00:50:21.184]  No hat in all cattle.
[00:50:22.024 --> 00:50:23.145]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:50:24.107 --> 00:50:28.009]  Thank you for joining us on this live September 22nd, Tuesday transmission.
[00:50:28.549 --> 00:50:28.809]  All right.
[00:50:29.009 --> 00:50:35.512]  I am loaded with key news, loaded with incredibly important intel, but I'll never get to your calls if I don't start now.
[00:50:35.532 --> 00:50:40.374]  So I'm gonna take a bunch of calls at the bottom of the hour, and then I'm gonna hit a bunch of news and I'll go back to calls.
[00:50:40.394 --> 00:50:50.898]  And then G. Edward Griffin is joining us and believe me, you're not gonna want to miss this interview coming up here in just a little while.
[00:50:55.049 --> 00:51:04.754]  I'm not going to get into what I'm going to cover next until I'm taking your calls, but it deals with Supreme Court, it deals with forced inoculation, it deals with censorship, it deals with mind control.
[00:51:06.074 --> 00:51:10.136]  You know, I hadn't seen the John Bowne report that I just aired last segment.
[00:51:10.156 --> 00:51:11.657]  Some stations don't carry that first segment.
[00:51:13.294 --> 00:51:16.035]  DARPA unleashes COVID microchip domination.
[00:51:16.355 --> 00:51:19.656]  It's in the John Bowne section, left-hand corner of Banned.video.
[00:51:19.696 --> 00:51:20.876]  Just click that, find it.
[00:51:20.896 --> 00:51:25.937]  If you want to share a video, though, on Facebook or Twitter, you've got to go to 2020ElectionCenter.com.
[00:51:26.578 --> 00:51:30.799]  It is a mirror of that site, but that URL is not yet banned.
[00:51:31.459 --> 00:51:33.980]  2020ElectionCenter.com to find that John Bowne video.
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:38.881]  And I knew that it was in the news.
[00:51:38.901 --> 00:51:42.422]  They were saying Alex Jones was a liar just last week.
[00:51:43.783 --> 00:51:46.728]  No one is coming door-to-door to take blood samples for the CDC.
[00:51:48.672 --> 00:51:49.954]  And Alex Jones is a liar.
[00:51:50.555 --> 00:51:56.566]  The UN is not in control of every major nation-state's governmental response to COVID-19.
[00:51:59.192 --> 00:52:06.979]  And then I was watching Jon Bowne's report where he took things I said yesterday about it and he went and found the newscast and they're like, there's no one coming to get your blood.
[00:52:07.059 --> 00:52:11.843]  And that's like the same time it's been on the news for months, they're coming and trying to force you to take blood.
[00:52:12.323 --> 00:52:14.485]  The mayor of Houston says, well, we do pressure you to do it.
[00:52:15.566 --> 00:52:18.008]  And again, in Australia, they're making you do it.
[00:52:18.689 --> 00:52:21.972]  And then CNN goes, oh, we're actually following the UN mandate.
[00:52:23.086 --> 00:52:25.587]  And Sundar Pichai says they're following it, the head of Google.
[00:52:25.887 --> 00:52:27.788]  And the head of YouTube says we follow UN orders.
[00:52:27.848 --> 00:52:29.128]  I mean, I could play you the clips again.
[00:52:29.148 --> 00:52:33.710]  And then they're running around saying it doesn't exist, it's not happening.
[00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:35.711]  We're under UN control!
[00:52:35.731 --> 00:52:40.092]  And then the CDC comes out last night and says, we're sorry.
[00:52:40.513 --> 00:52:42.233]  We said COVID-19 is airborne.
[00:52:42.874 --> 00:52:45.375]  The UN said in February it wasn't.
[00:52:45.975 --> 00:52:50.256]  And so we, they are the boss and we defer to them.
[00:52:50.697 --> 00:52:51.657]  I covered it last hour.
[00:52:53.283 --> 00:53:00.106]  CDC embarrassed after they were too big for their britches and said COVID can be transmitted in the air.
[00:53:01.186 --> 00:53:01.466]  Oooh!
[00:53:03.487 --> 00:53:06.628]  When that's a fact, does it mean it kills you?
[00:53:06.848 --> 00:53:07.088]  No.
[00:53:08.509 --> 00:53:09.369]  Very weak virus.
[00:53:10.670 --> 00:53:14.151]  But it obviously can be carried in the air in a sneeze droplet.
[00:53:15.552 --> 00:53:18.593]  Hell, if the wind hits it right, it might travel a thousand yards.
[00:53:20.538 --> 00:53:22.579]  They don't know if it's 6 feet or 20 feet.
[00:53:22.919 --> 00:53:25.221]  They've already got studies that it's 28 feet or 79 feet.
[00:53:26.101 --> 00:53:34.686]  Because they can sit there with it in a spray bottle and put it in the air and then have a sensor pick it up.
[00:53:36.207 --> 00:53:47.394]  But our own CDC can't take their shoes off, I guess, or make a cup of coffee without the UN's authorization.
[00:53:47.614 --> 00:53:49.015]  I mean, think about that level of slavery.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:53.523]  Remember just a few years ago, we would talk about the EU.
[00:53:54.364 --> 00:54:00.710]  Going back a decade ago with Facebook, hiring former members of the Stasi, secret police, to oversee it.
[00:54:01.010 --> 00:54:04.294]  Moving into the old Stasi headquarters and all the rest of it, just bizarre.
[00:54:07.036 --> 00:54:08.318]  And they would say at that time,
[00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:15.211]  That, well, you covered that migrants, not invaders, burned this down, or killed these people, or did that.
[00:54:15.491 --> 00:54:29.095]  And if you reported on who killed the girl, or who robbed somebody, or who murdered somebody, or who burned this down, or who stabbed this person, you would get suspended on Facebook, and the police would come and charge you, and you'd spend six months to a year in prison.
[00:54:29.355 --> 00:54:30.835]  Now it's ten years in prison!
[00:54:33.476 --> 00:54:34.796]  Well, now, in America,
[00:54:37.062 --> 00:54:38.723]  You can't even criticize the U.N.
[00:54:39.244 --> 00:54:40.885]  You can't even say, I don't want the U.N.
[00:54:40.925 --> 00:54:41.565]  running my life.
[00:54:41.805 --> 00:54:43.587]  I didn't elect the United Nations.
[00:54:46.129 --> 00:54:49.991]  And now, a football player for the Pittsburgh Steelers, who's a Bronze Star winner.
[00:54:50.011 --> 00:54:52.753]  We'll play this video later.
[00:54:53.954 --> 00:54:55.636]  Alejandro Gilaro.
[00:54:55.716 --> 00:54:57.337]  If I say that right, I always pronounce everything wrong.
[00:54:59.255 --> 00:55:00.776]  He went out and went ahead and stood.
[00:55:01.757 --> 00:55:02.698]  Nobody else did.
[00:55:02.858 --> 00:55:04.939]  And now, they're talking about getting him in trouble.
[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:10.264]  Oh, just a few years ago, it was okay if you wanted to take a knee during this thing, or do the black power fist for all this crap.
[00:55:10.304 --> 00:55:11.124]  Nike would fund you.
[00:55:11.484 --> 00:55:13.106]  And it was everybody's right to do what they want.
[00:55:13.326 --> 00:55:14.907]  But now, he's in trouble.
[00:55:17.429 --> 00:55:19.611]  Because he's a veteran and he didn't like that.
[00:55:20.404 --> 00:55:22.306]  That's a cult, folks, in America.
[00:55:22.926 --> 00:55:23.887]  I've got the articles right here.
[00:55:23.947 --> 00:55:30.213]  The team's really mad, and the coach is mad, and he's apologized for not being in solidarity with his team.
[00:55:34.196 --> 00:55:35.758]  Man, that's a fate worse than death, man.
[00:55:36.438 --> 00:55:42.163]  So just like that, suddenly, you're not allowed to stand for the national anthem.
[00:55:44.085 --> 00:55:46.627]  I told you 10 years ago, that in the year 2020,
[00:55:48.314 --> 00:55:56.098]  High school students would be suspended for having American flags at a football game and that the principal said that that's a symbol of evil.
[00:55:57.219 --> 00:55:58.460]  You'd say that'll never happen.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:55:59.180]  Well, guess what?
[00:55:59.220 --> 00:56:00.020]  It happened last week.
[00:56:00.421 --> 00:56:02.042]  This is what we put up with.
[00:56:02.362 --> 00:56:03.262]  Look in the mirror.
[00:56:03.662 --> 00:56:04.383]  We're to blame.
[00:56:07.945 --> 00:56:15.329]  Kevin, Joshua, Jim, Travis, Casey, Rockwave, Joey, Dee, Matt, Ryan, I'm going to get to every one of you.
[00:56:16.872 --> 00:56:19.414]  So I'll do the next two segments of calls and I'll cover the other news then.
[00:56:19.454 --> 00:56:20.876]  I've already started covering some of it now.
[00:56:21.296 --> 00:56:24.219]  But this is just getting absolutely crazy.
[00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:26.501]  Separately...
[00:56:28.206 --> 00:56:36.873]  I've come to the listeners many times, and I thank you for your support, but I just want you to understand that everything's been critical up until now, but this is when the planets are politically aligning.
[00:56:37.273 --> 00:56:40.615]  This is Super Bowl time, to use a football analogy.
[00:56:41.216 --> 00:56:54.606]  And if this isn't just Super Bowl, we've been in the Super Bowl a while, we're in sudden death overtime right now, and it's not about who wins the game, it's about going under a scientific tyranny run by big tech and the chi-coms and the globalists that wants to
[00:56:55.226 --> 00:57:00.471]  Absolutely crush America and dominate us and enslave us in their own words.
[00:57:02.332 --> 00:57:10.979]  This is a existential will of the Satanist to destroy what was the greatest Christian nation on earth and the most powerful.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:20.407]  We forgot our power, we gave up our power, and now we're fallen and pathetic, but still they want to bring us down because we're coming down fast, but we're miles above them.
[00:57:25.868 --> 00:57:26.428]  Charlie Manson.
[00:57:28.409 --> 00:57:30.249]  So that's where we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:57:31.490 --> 00:57:32.290]  So I'm just going to tell you.
[00:57:36.891 --> 00:57:41.712]  I don't take vitamin D3 because of their hyped-up garbage and the New World Order.
[00:57:42.093 --> 00:57:52.155]  I take it because a regular cold virus or a regular flu virus can kill a baby, it can kill an old person, it can kill anybody that doesn't have D3.
[00:57:52.415 --> 00:57:53.816]  If you have a deficiency of D3,
[00:57:56.112 --> 00:58:00.215]  It's only a matter of time until you get degenerative diseases from it and you die.
[00:58:00.895 --> 00:58:03.437]  And it's the same thing for every essential vitamin and mineral.
[00:58:03.657 --> 00:58:04.718]  That is a scientific fact.
[00:58:04.918 --> 00:58:10.001]  But the UN came out this year and said, oh, there's nothing that can be a preventative.
[00:58:10.362 --> 00:58:12.083]  No, vitamins and minerals aren't needed.
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:16.642]  It's like telling a catfish, you don't need water to live.
[00:58:16.682 --> 00:58:18.383]  You can live in the desert.
[00:58:19.124 --> 00:58:20.465]  It's that level of an insult.
[00:58:20.685 --> 00:58:24.588]  So yes, I sell things that you have to have to live.
[00:58:25.188 --> 00:58:29.592]  We sell water filtration to cut out all the chemicals and problems and give you good, clean, pure water.
[00:58:30.192 --> 00:58:30.853]  Highest rated.
[00:58:30.873 --> 00:58:34.876]  People go, wow, I looked at what Jones sells, the two brands he sells are the two highest rated.
[00:58:37.058 --> 00:58:37.518]  Exactly.
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:40.340]  That's what I do.
[00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:42.102]  It's how I treat myself.
[00:58:43.715 --> 00:58:46.816]  You have to understand, folks, I neurotically have to treat you like I treat myself.
[00:58:46.856 --> 00:58:47.637]  That's my rule.
[00:58:48.237 --> 00:58:49.838]  It's not even something I'm in control of.
[00:58:50.538 --> 00:58:52.619]  And I just can't believe everybody else doesn't follow that rule.
[00:58:52.879 --> 00:58:54.319]  But I love you and I appreciate you.
[00:58:54.359 --> 00:58:55.240]  This is stuff you need.
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:58:57.821]  You should go to mfulmorestore.com to get your water filtration.
[00:58:58.141 --> 00:59:03.483]  But Winter Sun, highest quality D3, under the tongue, with vitamin K that helps it absorb somehow.
[00:59:03.523 --> 00:59:04.964]  I'm not, the scientists tell me that.
[00:59:05.384 --> 00:59:09.546]  It's essential as well, but they go together like a horse and carriage, like a key in a keyhole.
[00:59:10.126 --> 00:59:16.089]  That is 50% off, with free shipping, despite the fact it's selling out, and I'm told more isn't coming in until November.
[00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:21.611]  Stuff's so crazy, if Trump loses, they're gonna come in here and shut us down after that.
[00:59:21.851 --> 00:59:27.994]  So that's why I'm selling everything out, even though a lot of this stuff is... DNA Force Plus, oh, how about for your cells and your health?
[00:59:28.854 --> 00:59:29.574]  It's the next level.
[00:59:30.455 --> 00:59:34.176]  PQQ, CoQ10, Organic Reishi, Astragalus, even more.
[00:59:34.336 --> 00:59:37.578]  ELEVATP, Ancient Peat Apple Extract.
[00:59:38.815 --> 00:59:46.138]  It's 60% off with free shipping, and it's selling out, but I've just got to get the funds in because stuff's so dangerous in the future.
[00:59:46.358 --> 00:59:49.140]  So if you're ever waiting to get DNA for us, that's the lowest price ever.
[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:50.500]  I'd take advantage of that right now.
[00:59:50.820 --> 00:59:52.261]  I'll come right back with your phone calls.
[00:59:52.841 --> 00:59:53.301]  Stay with us.
[00:59:53.702 --> 00:59:56.383]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[00:59:57.083 --> 00:59:58.584]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[00:59:59.044 --> 01:00:00.325]  Is your city too safe?
[01:00:02.782 --> 01:00:03.763]  Well, not anymore.
[01:00:04.524 --> 01:00:06.386]  Introducing Democrats.
[01:00:06.926 --> 01:00:15.054]  Politicians so incompetent, they'll fill your neighborhood with riots, looting, rampant violence, and even homelessness.
[01:00:15.895 --> 01:00:20.079]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old-fashioned stupidity.
[01:00:20.900 --> 01:00:22.922]  No more pesky law and order.
[01:00:23.302 --> 01:00:25.825]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[01:00:27.012 --> 01:00:31.578]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back, and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground!
[01:00:32.359 --> 01:00:32.899]  But wait!
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:41.489]  Vote for Democrats now and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes, and more taxes!
[01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:45.213]  Democrats, bringing chaos right to your front door!
[01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:56.439]  But it wasn't because I didn't know too much.
[01:00:58.420 --> 01:00:59.140]  I knew too much.
[01:01:03.202 --> 01:01:04.702]  This is the battle for the whole world.
[01:01:05.443 --> 01:01:08.464]  As America goes, so goes the planet.
[01:01:09.564 --> 01:01:12.726]  But now America that had been sleeping knows she's in a fight of her life.
[01:01:13.866 --> 01:01:17.248]  And everybody that's got a fighting spirit is awakening and rallying to the fight.
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.241]  That's a beautiful thing to see.
[01:01:20.081 --> 01:01:24.503]  And out of this, I foresee America coming together like never before.
[01:01:26.284 --> 01:01:30.966]  And in the future, standing against the great technocracy threat and overcoming it.
[01:01:33.448 --> 01:01:35.109]  This is only the prelude to the future.
[01:01:37.510 --> 01:01:39.791]  All right, I want to go to your calls, but just look at these headlines.
[01:01:41.187 --> 01:01:47.871]  Young man injured by Gardasil files lawsuit against Merck as cases pile up, but it goes to a vaccine damage fund, so you can't do anything.
[01:01:48.031 --> 01:01:49.171]  This is insane.
[01:01:49.772 --> 01:01:50.292]  Look at this one.
[01:01:50.632 --> 01:01:55.615]  Bloomberg pays fines of 32,000 felons in Florida so they can vote.
[01:01:56.515 --> 01:02:01.578]  Now again, why would Bloomberg spend millions and millions of dollars to pay those fines?
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.221]  Because Trump barely won Florida.
[01:02:07.882 --> 01:02:10.283]  Trump barely won Florida.
[01:02:11.817 --> 01:02:13.879]  100,000 votes and change.
[01:02:15.620 --> 01:02:16.140]  Hillary got 4,504,000.
[01:02:16.581 --> 01:02:17.061]  Trump 4,000,000.
[01:02:17.121 --> 01:02:18.122]  Hillary got 4,504,000.
[01:02:18.782 --> 01:02:19.643]  Trump got 4,617,000.
[01:02:21.745 --> 01:02:29.731]  So all you gotta do is, you know, get a couple hundred more thousand to vote.
[01:02:29.751 --> 01:02:31.953]  They think they're in it to win it.
[01:02:32.513 --> 01:02:35.415]  I'm telling you, man, this is such a close fight, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:02:37.197 --> 01:02:39.859]  But I know a lot of people that have been wrongfully convicted felons
[01:02:41.701 --> 01:02:45.403]  Mainly in Democrat jurisdictions who get what's going on and they're going to vote Trump.
[01:02:46.124 --> 01:02:50.146]  Trump's the one saying, let nonviolent people out of prison.
[01:02:50.166 --> 01:02:52.288]  Trump's the one trying to actually get jobs back to America.
[01:02:53.628 --> 01:02:56.790]  So this cheap trick by the Democrats is just that, a cheap trick.
[01:02:57.111 --> 01:02:58.111]  Okay, let's go to the calls.
[01:02:58.151 --> 01:02:58.852]  Let's go to the calls.
[01:02:58.892 --> 01:02:59.712]  Let's go to the calls.
[01:03:00.413 --> 01:03:02.954]  Who has been holding the longest?
[01:03:05.656 --> 01:03:07.677]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ryan in Texas.
[01:03:07.737 --> 01:03:08.838]  Ryan, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:03:11.445 --> 01:03:13.905]  Hey, Alex, everyday listener, first time caller.
[01:03:14.126 --> 01:03:14.586]  Thank you, sir.
[01:03:15.746 --> 01:03:21.447]  Hey, so I've been following along with you every day, just about.
[01:03:22.467 --> 01:03:29.168]  And since this COVID thing started, I really got into what's been going on in the world.
[01:03:29.228 --> 01:03:37.690]  And my dad got home from a business trip about mid-March on the East Coast, and
[01:03:38.607 --> 01:03:47.550]  He right away started feeling pretty bad and went to the doctor and they said, well, you've got flu type B. And stayed at home, sick, just kept deteriorating.
[01:03:48.730 --> 01:03:51.451]  Ended up having like a 103 degree fever.
[01:03:51.731 --> 01:03:54.172]  And this is when they were just starting to do drive-thru testing.
[01:03:55.353 --> 01:04:03.055]  Well, he went to try to get a drive-thru test done in our hometown and he didn't have a high enough fever, apparently.
[01:04:03.996 --> 01:04:05.156]  So they sent him, turned him away.
[01:04:06.651 --> 01:04:11.213]  And he finally went to our family physician again, and he said, look, I'm just not getting any better.
[01:04:12.113 --> 01:04:15.835]  And they did a test, and it turned out to be coronavirus.
[01:04:17.035 --> 01:04:18.336]  And so they said.
[01:04:18.776 --> 01:04:25.598]  And he prescribed hydroxychloroquine, Z-Pak, and was feeling better within 24 hours.
[01:04:26.199 --> 01:04:29.180]  Listen, that's why people that say it doesn't exist are doing a disservice.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:30.780]  It's a real virus.
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:31.641]  It's been scanned.
[01:04:32.694 --> 01:04:34.236]  And it spreads really easy.
[01:04:34.316 --> 01:04:34.976]  It's airborne.
[01:04:34.996 --> 01:04:37.358]  Of course, the UN says it's not because everything they say is a lie.
[01:04:37.979 --> 01:04:44.765]  But if people just have D3, zinc, and C at a high level, especially as you get older, your guts don't absorb it as much.
[01:04:46.326 --> 01:04:52.812]  But again, people found out about this were going to medical doctors and getting preventative IVs.
[01:04:52.972 --> 01:04:53.553]  I got some.
[01:04:53.913 --> 01:04:58.177]  I mean, I took this serious of C and other things, and I felt great.
[01:04:58.677 --> 01:04:59.097]  And again,
[01:05:00.262 --> 01:05:01.402]  They don't want you to know that.
[01:05:01.462 --> 01:05:02.322]  How crazy is that?
[01:05:02.342 --> 01:05:04.883]  So how big a wake up call or was your dad already awake?
[01:05:05.143 --> 01:05:15.225]  And how big a deal is that your dad might have died unless the doctor actually knew what to do and ignored Fauci and the UN and Bill Gates and got him that hydroxychloroquine that pushes zinc into the cells?
[01:05:16.165 --> 01:05:20.806]  Well, like I said, this was early on before hydroxychloroquine was so demonized.
[01:05:21.486 --> 01:05:24.606]  And I mean, the local media even did a story on him afterwards.
[01:05:24.726 --> 01:05:28.927]  But this is the craziest thing in all this is my mom.
[01:05:29.824 --> 01:05:30.244]  Well, you know what?
[01:05:59.542 --> 01:06:03.225]  COVID, the antibodies were already gone within a month.
[01:06:03.385 --> 01:06:04.086]  That's what's weird.
[01:06:04.106 --> 01:06:05.267]  This thing's genetically engineered.
[01:06:05.287 --> 01:06:06.388]  That's why it keeps coming back.
[01:06:06.508 --> 01:06:08.069]  It doesn't produce antibodies most of the time.
[01:06:08.289 --> 01:06:09.030]  And I'm no scientist.
[01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:11.732]  I'm just saying, there's a curveball in this COVID, folks.
[01:06:11.832 --> 01:06:16.356]  I haven't figured it out yet, but the way it's got five different viruses, the way it's mutating.
[01:06:16.837 --> 01:06:19.218]  Gates even told us, he said, it's going to mutate again and be even worse.
[01:06:19.319 --> 01:06:20.059]  I think that's true.
[01:06:20.379 --> 01:06:21.400]  This is just the beta test.
[01:06:21.420 --> 01:06:22.081]  God bless you, brother.
[01:06:22.521 --> 01:06:25.404]  And so the bottom line is, fortify your immune system.
[01:06:25.424 --> 01:06:26.505]  And while that sun's still out,
[01:06:27.352 --> 01:06:29.054]  Take your shirt off when you're mowing the yard.
[01:06:29.094 --> 01:06:29.935]  Who cares what the neighbors think?
[01:06:30.976 --> 01:06:32.557]  That's what I do when I'm working in the yard or something.
[01:06:32.577 --> 01:06:33.879]  I just put on short shorts.
[01:06:34.459 --> 01:06:38.363]  You know, my wife makes a joke about it, and I'm out there in my tennis shoes, and I mean, I get the sun.
[01:06:39.424 --> 01:06:40.145]  Get the sun.
[01:06:40.265 --> 01:06:45.411]  Even if you're, like, in the southern area of the country, you can still get sun even in the deep winter.
[01:06:46.525 --> 01:06:49.387]  But, you know, up north, you've got to fortify yourselves.
[01:06:49.407 --> 01:06:52.890]  And again, D3 does not absorb well in the gut.
[01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:55.852]  That's why under the tongue is the way to do it, winter sun.
[01:06:56.352 --> 01:06:59.855]  And it's just like Jones is claiming he's got COVID cures.
[01:07:00.375 --> 01:07:04.819]  Well, yeah, I mean, if you're in the desert and you don't have water,
[01:07:06.124 --> 01:07:07.185]  You will die of thirst.
[01:07:07.225 --> 01:07:11.370]  So if somebody's like, hey, you better buy some canteens for you going to the desert, it's ridiculous.
[01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:12.431]  I don't have a COVID cure.
[01:07:12.731 --> 01:07:16.095]  Once you've got it, once you're run down, once you're dying, this isn't about COVID.
[01:07:16.435 --> 01:07:21.421]  I've been selling winter sun for six years because you need D3 in the winter and Fauci said it.
[01:07:21.801 --> 01:07:24.985]  But again, the mainstream murdering media.
[01:07:26.365 --> 01:07:29.126]  It's like, you don't need D3, they're scammers!
[01:07:29.167 --> 01:07:37.971]  Why, the FBI raided medical doctors that are prescribing vitamin C and D3 and zinc as a preventative, while the UN says there's no preventative!
[01:07:39.452 --> 01:07:41.753]  It's like saying, food, the preventative to starvation.
[01:07:42.093 --> 01:07:44.415]  Water, the preventative to dehydration.
[01:07:47.536 --> 01:07:50.658]  I even saw an article a few years ago where the FDA was trying to tell one of the
[01:07:51.937 --> 01:07:52.838]  Was it Powerade?
[01:07:52.878 --> 01:07:53.880]  Was it... I forget who it was.
[01:07:54.260 --> 01:08:02.292]  That you can't put on there, on the bottle, uh... Fights, dehydration, hydrate, hydrate... Oh, that's medical!
[01:08:02.532 --> 01:08:03.974]  You can't say something medical!
[01:08:04.195 --> 01:08:06.638]  You can't say Gatorade, hydrates, or whatever it was!
[01:08:06.859 --> 01:08:08.080]  This is a cult, man!
[01:08:09.604 --> 01:08:18.451]  Every word, every language they're telling us, we can't say on entrance forms for our kids in school, the mother and father, because some people don't have mothers and fathers.
[01:08:18.712 --> 01:08:23.175]  It's a cult that wants to outlaw all language, except what Big Tech says!
[01:08:24.536 --> 01:08:25.177]  You need air.
[01:08:25.417 --> 01:08:26.198]  You need water.
[01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:28.960]  And now Fauci's been forced to admit it.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.161]  We don't need him to tell us that.
[01:08:30.181 --> 01:08:32.683]  We don't need him to tell us we need D3, that little demon.
[01:08:34.381 --> 01:08:40.965]  All right, Gilbert Griffin is going to be on with us on the Yuri Brezhnev interview that's gone mega viral.
[01:08:41.005 --> 01:08:53.112]  Hell, I was airing it on AXS TV 26, 27 years ago, but it's back and it's in top video games and in movies and people watch it and go, my God, everything this guy said is coming true.
[01:08:53.956 --> 01:08:55.017]  But it's not Russian.
[01:08:55.737 --> 01:09:00.860]  The globalists went and took over Russia, and set all this up, and then used them.
[01:09:00.940 --> 01:09:02.121]  And that's actually what he gets into.
[01:09:02.361 --> 01:09:04.022]  So there's a bigger picture, and J.E.B.
[01:09:04.042 --> 01:09:12.147]  Griffin is the leading intellectual, mac daddy, original gangster, when it comes to the Liberty Movement.
[01:09:12.207 --> 01:09:14.608]  He's the OG, okay?
[01:09:15.309 --> 01:09:16.389]  So he's joining us next hour.
[01:09:16.669 --> 01:09:18.250]  All right, I just spent five minutes with one caller.
[01:09:18.470 --> 01:09:19.871]  Incredible caller, incredible story.
[01:09:20.191 --> 01:09:22.493]  But I won't get to you all, so we gotta do two minutes of caller here.
[01:09:23.424 --> 01:09:26.046]  Let's go to Matt in Nebraska.
[01:09:26.086 --> 01:09:26.866]  Matt, thanks for calling.
[01:09:26.886 --> 01:09:27.267]  Go ahead.
[01:09:28.748 --> 01:09:29.828]  Hey, what's going on, Alex?
[01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:35.272]  Man, I tell you, I'm in suspense every day like I'm watching a Super Bowl game.
[01:09:35.352 --> 01:09:39.055]  I mean, it's like, this is crazy.
[01:09:39.375 --> 01:09:41.216]  300 million people are right there with you.
[01:09:43.198 --> 01:09:48.221]  Governor Ricketts just said he will not mandate a COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:09:48.241 --> 01:09:51.003]  He'll leave it up to the Nebraska citizen if he said that today.
[01:09:51.465 --> 01:09:53.486]  That is a good, I didn't know that, that's a good precedent.
[01:09:53.806 --> 01:09:58.447]  Federal judge ruled that Pennsylvania Governor Wolf is a criminal and that his whole lockdown is illegal.
[01:09:58.507 --> 01:10:08.151]  So, we've got those rights and we need to, and again, what they use, what the globalists say they'll use corporations and then localities they control to override central governments and governors.
[01:10:08.611 --> 01:10:15.033]  Well, we need governors to then go after the cities that keep the lockdown going and after the corporations that keep it going.
[01:10:15.373 --> 01:10:20.174]  Because remember, that's why Amazon's doubled its profits since they started shutting down Main Street.
[01:10:20.495 --> 01:10:21.975]  So this is economic warfare, brother.
[01:10:22.515 --> 01:10:24.616]  Again, so you're saying the governor of Nebraska just did this?
[01:10:25.576 --> 01:10:28.297]  Yeah, he said that this morning in his weekly press conference.
[01:10:28.317 --> 01:10:32.858]  He said he will not mandate any COVID-19 vaccine when it comes out.
[01:10:32.878 --> 01:10:33.198]  Beautiful.
[01:10:33.218 --> 01:10:36.159]  So Nebraska governor will not mandate COVID-19 vaccine.
[01:10:36.179 --> 01:10:36.779]  That's beautiful.
[01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:37.339]  That's wonderful.
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:42.461]  If anybody Googles this, it should be in the first headline.
[01:10:43.171 --> 01:10:44.772]  Wow, that is certainly some good news.
[01:10:44.812 --> 01:10:45.912]  Any other good news, my friend?
[01:10:45.932 --> 01:10:59.399]  Uh, no, but I noticed listening to the Omaha Z92 radio station, they were saying that if you get a call from an unknown number, they were saying that you have been in contact with a COVID-19 person.
[01:11:00.080 --> 01:11:03.982]  So now, I don't know how they get, so they're doing contract tracing in Omaha.
[01:11:04.322 --> 01:11:06.823]  Oh, sir, this is all a systematic U.N.
[01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:07.884]  plan, beta tested in
[01:11:11.423 --> 01:11:13.143]  Australia and in Spain.
[01:11:13.783 --> 01:11:15.744]  And then now they're phasing it in here.
[01:11:15.924 --> 01:11:19.745]  Everything they did there, we already could tell that was happening, because the UN said they would.
[01:11:19.985 --> 01:11:23.625]  But CNN now officially said, we're going to be like Australia by next year.
[01:11:23.645 --> 01:11:24.205]  Can you believe that?
[01:11:24.466 --> 01:11:28.026]  And if Joe Biden gets in, man, they are going to clamp down forever, brother.
[01:11:28.046 --> 01:11:32.667]  I think they're going to try to push it, even if Trump does get re-elected.
[01:11:32.727 --> 01:11:34.207]  So, I mean, it's just going to be crazy.
[01:11:34.407 --> 01:11:36.808]  And people get pissed at Trump and they go, well, he should stop that.
[01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:43.474]  He ordered the federal government not to teach that white people or racist 13-week class.
[01:11:43.774 --> 01:11:46.216]  And the federal agencies literally told him, burn in hell.
[01:11:46.617 --> 01:11:47.878]  They just do whatever they want, brother.
[01:11:47.898 --> 01:11:56.105]  I'm still mad at him because he gave the power to the governors to order lockdowns on COVID-19.
[01:11:56.125 --> 01:11:57.887]  He never said anything about locking down.
[01:11:57.907 --> 01:11:59.368]  He just gave all power to the governors.
[01:12:00.046 --> 01:12:01.847]  Well, that's because it's the Constitution.
[01:12:01.887 --> 01:12:03.168]  He's following the Constitution.
[01:12:03.429 --> 01:12:07.171]  But when the governors violate the Constitution, the federal government's supposed to kick in.
[01:12:07.492 --> 01:12:13.556]  If the federal government, if Biden gets in and is doing tyrannical, unconstitutional stuff, it's the state's job to organize and say no.
[01:12:13.856 --> 01:12:15.958]  Well, instead, the states are doing bad stuff.
[01:12:16.298 --> 01:12:17.639]  That's how the federalist system works.
[01:12:17.679 --> 01:12:19.961]  When they violate the Constitution, the feds come in.
[01:12:20.922 --> 01:12:22.643]  When the feds violate, we stand up.
[01:12:22.683 --> 01:12:23.223]  See how that works?
[01:12:24.164 --> 01:12:26.586]  Now, wasn't it Obama that said there's no tyranny going on?
[01:12:28.055 --> 01:12:29.476]  Oh, we ought to play that speech.
[01:12:29.496 --> 01:12:31.818]  It was like a West Point commencement speech.
[01:12:32.418 --> 01:12:38.462]  And he said, don't believe people there's a new world order and that tyranny's coming and that there's going to be martial law and a lockdown.
[01:12:39.423 --> 01:12:40.884]  I'm glad you mentioned that, guys.
[01:12:41.384 --> 01:12:41.905]  Ask Rob Dewey.
[01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:42.765]  He's good at finding stuff.
[01:12:43.606 --> 01:12:47.388]  Obama says in speech, there is no tyranny.
[01:12:47.889 --> 01:12:48.609]  God bless you, sir.
[01:12:48.669 --> 01:12:49.390]  Great points, Matt.
[01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:53.653]  And I'm glad you called in to let us know about Nebraska.
[01:12:53.673 --> 01:12:54.933]  Did you guys find any articles on that?
[01:12:54.953 --> 01:12:55.554]  I'm sure he's right.
[01:12:57.970 --> 01:13:02.193]  Nebraska Governor, but every time we put out some good news, Google blocks it.
[01:13:03.214 --> 01:13:10.559]  So I wouldn't be surprised if, there it is, Governor Ricketts, Nebraska will encourage COVID-19 vaccines, but will not mandate them.
[01:13:13.301 --> 01:13:16.103]  That's the media spin on it, but that means they're not going to try to make it forced.
[01:13:16.444 --> 01:13:21.387]  Which it still is recommended by the Governor, that kicks in the Health Department to make it a list of recommended.
[01:13:21.507 --> 01:13:24.510]  Doesn't still mean you have to do it, even if he quote, mandates it.
[01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:26.111]  But they use that color law.
[01:13:29.352 --> 01:13:30.713]  Joey in Miami.
[01:13:30.733 --> 01:13:31.413]  You're on the air.
[01:13:31.493 --> 01:13:31.793]  Welcome.
[01:13:38.437 --> 01:13:39.438]  I guess he just hung up.
[01:13:39.538 --> 01:13:39.918]  All right.
[01:13:40.358 --> 01:13:41.679]  Casey in North Dakota.
[01:13:41.719 --> 01:13:42.219]  Thanks for holding.
[01:13:42.239 --> 01:13:42.839]  Go ahead, Casey.
[01:13:45.301 --> 01:13:46.021]  Hello, Sensei.
[01:13:47.062 --> 01:13:47.762]  Welcome, my friend.
[01:13:47.802 --> 01:13:48.182]  Go ahead.
[01:13:49.223 --> 01:13:49.623]  Yes, sir.
[01:13:50.043 --> 01:13:56.387]  Well, I just want to send a little message to the New World Order elitist thugs that
[01:13:57.068 --> 01:14:02.870]  We know one way or the other, no matter how this election turns out, no quarter is going to be given.
[01:14:03.850 --> 01:14:06.091]  It's on like Donkey Kong and we're ready.
[01:14:06.111 --> 01:14:10.492]  We're ready to ram head wherever beachhead may be.
[01:14:10.512 --> 01:14:16.074]  It's in Texas, Illinois, Minnesota, whenever we need to be there, we're going to be there.
[01:14:16.094 --> 01:14:18.395]  And hopefully the military can take care of it themselves.
[01:14:19.505 --> 01:14:23.408]  We don't need to get the citizens involved, but we're ready to roll when we need to.
[01:14:23.428 --> 01:14:24.769]  And this isn't a threat.
[01:14:24.829 --> 01:14:25.729]  We love the military.
[01:14:25.769 --> 01:14:26.650]  They're some of our best people.
[01:14:26.690 --> 01:14:31.634]  But if the globalists can control the military and come against us, the military better decide which side they're on.
[01:14:31.654 --> 01:14:33.695]  Absolutely.
[01:14:33.815 --> 01:14:38.598]  And we know that through everything that they've done, that no quarter is going to be given to us.
[01:14:38.739 --> 01:14:41.761]  Well, no quarter will be given to them at all.
[01:14:42.421 --> 01:14:49.146]  And I just want to send a lot of love and prayers to you, the InforWarriors team, the president, and this whole country.
[01:14:50.057 --> 01:14:51.239]  Now's the time, people.
[01:14:51.619 --> 01:14:56.105]  Get it together, because 40 days out, it's coming to a head.
[01:14:58.706 --> 01:15:01.529]  I agree with you, brother, and it's like Carlos Zapata said.
[01:15:01.589 --> 01:15:03.611]  He doesn't want a war, but we're under attack.
[01:15:03.671 --> 01:15:07.375]  And if they keep pushing, there's millions of us, and we will not fail.
[01:15:07.435 --> 01:15:07.936]  We will win.
[01:15:08.196 --> 01:15:08.897]  We have the power.
[01:15:09.097 --> 01:15:13.581]  We don't want the power, but to all these dirty communist people, you guys are really asking for it.
[01:15:14.062 --> 01:15:20.809]  And so once it's go time, once we decide that we can't fix this peacefully, there's no stopping.
[01:15:22.705 --> 01:15:23.265]  Absolutely.
[01:15:23.606 --> 01:15:24.967]  There's a great Garth Brooks song.
[01:15:25.007 --> 01:15:26.668]  It's an old one off his first album.
[01:15:26.908 --> 01:15:28.009]  Not to plug Garth Brooks.
[01:15:28.089 --> 01:15:28.429]  It's okay.
[01:15:28.449 --> 01:15:29.210]  I like Garth Brooks.
[01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.731]  Yes, sir.
[01:15:30.971 --> 01:15:32.072]  It's called Against the Grain.
[01:15:32.132 --> 01:15:33.513]  It's off his first album there.
[01:15:33.533 --> 01:15:37.335]  That is Infowars and U2 at T. And the rest of the Patriots out there.
[01:15:37.535 --> 01:15:38.836]  Check it out sometime when you've got time out.
[01:15:38.856 --> 01:15:39.076]  All right.
[01:15:39.116 --> 01:15:39.977]  God bless you, Casey.
[01:15:39.997 --> 01:15:41.538]  Let's jam in another call before we go to break.
[01:15:42.159 --> 01:15:43.419]  Who's been holding longest here?
[01:15:43.499 --> 01:15:44.000]  Travis?
[01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:45.621]  Or is it D?
[01:15:45.681 --> 01:15:46.582]  Is it Rockwave?
[01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:50.137]  It'll be Rockwave, then we'll go to Kevin.
[01:15:50.237 --> 01:15:52.518]  Rockwave in the great state of Texas.
[01:15:53.178 --> 01:15:54.198]  Still Texas.
[01:15:54.238 --> 01:15:55.278]  Not for long, though, folks.
[01:15:55.299 --> 01:15:57.059]  Don't stand up and speak out.
[01:15:57.439 --> 01:15:58.159]  Rockwave, go ahead.
[01:15:58.179 --> 01:16:00.300]  God bless you.
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:01.440]  We pray for you every day.
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:03.200]  We really appreciate everything you're doing.
[01:16:03.440 --> 01:16:05.061]  All of your products are top-notch.
[01:16:05.161 --> 01:16:06.761]  Let me just say this, Rockwave, because I mean it.
[01:16:06.821 --> 01:16:08.121]  Without your prayer, I'd be destroyed.
[01:16:08.381 --> 01:16:09.742]  You are literally holding me up now.
[01:16:10.002 --> 01:16:10.482]  So thank you.
[01:16:11.445 --> 01:16:12.106]  Absolutely.
[01:16:12.146 --> 01:16:16.852]  We're everyday listeners and we just moved here from California.
[01:16:17.052 --> 01:16:29.366]  We got out of the exodus with all the fires surrounding us, all the ridiculous mandates that the governor has, and we finally got to Texas and we've been street teaming for InfoWars, getting
[01:16:30.325 --> 01:16:39.288]  Getting the stickers up, band out video stickers up, and we printed up our own business cards with the links on there and doing a lot of face-to-face contact with people.
[01:16:39.688 --> 01:16:46.410]  Just talking to people all about how you approach them, all the delivery, and people are very receptive.
[01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:47.390]  We're really excited.
[01:16:47.690 --> 01:16:49.111]  New information is getting out there now.
[01:16:50.384 --> 01:16:51.145]  Well, I love you, brother.
[01:16:51.185 --> 01:16:51.646]  Keep it up.
[01:16:52.366 --> 01:17:00.356]  And we'll definitely continue to work with everybody out there like you, and we love you, and we understand that your spirit is leading you to do this, and we love you, and we appreciate you as well.
[01:17:01.577 --> 01:17:07.484]  You know, when I said I couldn't be on air if it wasn't for your prayers, I'm serious, folks, because I'm strong.
[01:17:08.205 --> 01:17:09.066]  I'll never give up.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.421]  I'll never give in, but I can give out.
[01:17:11.541 --> 01:17:16.263]  And I, literally, when these horrible things happen to me behind the scenes, which I don't want you to feel sorry for me, I ask for all this.
[01:17:16.283 --> 01:17:19.384]  I just want to say it's God's Spirit and your prayers calling for that.
[01:17:19.404 --> 01:17:20.885]  Because God, it's an energy.
[01:17:20.905 --> 01:17:21.725]  God pays attention to that.
[01:17:22.065 --> 01:17:23.686]  You are literally holding me up.
[01:17:23.966 --> 01:17:35.351]  Because now I just get hit by absolutely horrible stuff on a routine basis and I just like, and it's like, I feel myself being weak and it's just like, I start leaning back and this thing goes, and I,
[01:17:36.894 --> 01:17:51.147]  In fact, the worst it is now, and I mean this is the real spiritual thing, it's like now, it's like, my understanding, my discernment, I know yours as well, but it's like, when you guys are praying for me, I literally, it's like space warp, like light speed.
[01:17:52.288 --> 01:17:53.689]  It's like, whoa!
[01:17:54.289 --> 01:17:58.510]  This is a lot better than being on my knees with the devil strangling me.
[01:17:58.810 --> 01:18:01.871]  Just to have you turn that Holy Spirit loose with your prayers, man.
[01:18:02.191 --> 01:18:05.572]  It's like getting like a car going from zero to 200 in a second.
[01:18:05.592 --> 01:18:06.433]  It's like, boom!
[01:18:06.633 --> 01:18:07.073]  Whoa!
[01:18:08.873 --> 01:18:14.095]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide the American system that threatens the tyrants.
[01:18:14.875 --> 01:18:19.757]  The wild, wild west of freedom versus the nightmare of North Korean Chi Com tyranny.
[01:18:21.397 --> 01:18:23.159]  G. Edward Griffin's going to be joining us coming up.
[01:18:25.621 --> 01:18:28.003]  The granddaddy of resisting the New World Order.
[01:18:28.044 --> 01:18:29.465]  We're taking your phone calls right now.
[01:18:30.386 --> 01:18:33.749]  I'm not going to belabor this, but it was a very successful campaign.
[01:18:34.129 --> 01:18:42.177]  So thank you all for supporting the broadcast and doing common sense things in the highest quality, storable foods, lowest price you're going to find for quality at prepare with Alex dot com.
[01:18:42.818 --> 01:18:44.600]  And so the weeklong special.
[01:18:46.104 --> 01:18:46.344]  I think so.
[01:18:58.769 --> 01:19:11.219]  A lot of our other distributors, people that buy from us, are upset that we have this one low price and that we're doing this special for you that's $170 off one food package and $100 off a water filtration package.
[01:19:11.539 --> 01:19:13.861]  And these are smaller packages, but they're still really good deals.
[01:19:14.462 --> 01:19:15.983]  They said, we'll extend it one more week.
[01:19:17.113 --> 01:19:19.273]  And I said, well, how about a new special then?
[01:19:19.314 --> 01:19:21.554]  How about a discount on your big food supplies or something?
[01:19:21.594 --> 01:19:23.374]  So we're talking about that right now.
[01:19:23.414 --> 01:19:27.255]  But whatever you do, there's only a one to two week delay in shipping.
[01:19:27.275 --> 01:19:33.297]  It's really like a week delay, but they just don't want me to say that because they want you to under promise over deliver is the rule.
[01:19:33.997 --> 01:19:35.277]  But prepare with Alex.com.
[01:19:35.617 --> 01:19:36.737]  High quality, storable food.
[01:19:37.037 --> 01:19:38.958]  The lowest price you're going to find for food this good.
[01:19:40.527 --> 01:19:44.091]  And the percentage we make off of it is key to keeping the lights on here.
[01:19:44.131 --> 01:19:49.638]  So you couldn't buy higher quality food at a lower price that then actually funds an operation like this.
[01:19:49.698 --> 01:19:53.463]  You couldn't find food at this price at this quality that doesn't fund an operation like this.
[01:19:53.843 --> 01:19:55.625]  This is the unicorn.
[01:19:56.066 --> 01:19:58.288]  This is the zeitgeist.
[01:19:58.348 --> 01:19:59.289]  This is the best deal.
[01:20:00.222 --> 01:20:05.284]  The full list of their larger supplies and their smaller supplies is at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:20:05.324 --> 01:20:06.184]  They're in our back end.
[01:20:06.204 --> 01:20:07.625]  It's a mirror of what they've got.
[01:20:07.745 --> 01:20:08.625]  Exact same prices.
[01:20:08.885 --> 01:20:10.146]  You go in the exact same queue.
[01:20:10.926 --> 01:20:13.527]  When you order at InfoWarsTore.com, though, it funds our operation.
[01:20:13.767 --> 01:20:21.590]  But they have this special at PrepareWithAlex.com because I haven't gotten into this for obvious reasons for those that work in business and life.
[01:20:23.806 --> 01:20:29.509]  Now that we have secured backups, I'm getting ready to tell people about it very soon, but they took all our bank accounts away.
[01:20:29.529 --> 01:20:34.331]  They took our shopping carts away and our merchant accounts, and luckily I had backups.
[01:20:34.351 --> 01:20:37.792]  We had to go to those and scramble, and they are harassing people.
[01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:39.153]  They are terrorizing us.
[01:20:39.533 --> 01:20:40.614]  They're not just doing it to us.
[01:20:40.674 --> 01:20:44.956]  The NRA, gun shops all over can't get credit card processing.
[01:20:45.036 --> 01:20:46.016]  I mean, this is tyranny.
[01:20:46.596 --> 01:20:49.097]  And so I may have product on the shelves.
[01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:52.019]  If I can't process it and take your money, I got to shut down.
[01:20:52.884 --> 01:20:57.645]  So I went and did all the accounting, and I already mortgaged my house, and I'll only fund this place a few months.
[01:20:58.605 --> 01:21:01.586]  And so that's why I'm like, okay, we're selling everything out.
[01:21:03.306 --> 01:21:05.507]  And I just haven't gotten to the point of coming out and saying it.
[01:21:05.547 --> 01:21:06.027]  I just did.
[01:21:06.107 --> 01:21:09.128]  So the special's called, what's the special called right now?
[01:21:09.148 --> 01:21:10.108]  I can't remember the name.
[01:21:11.068 --> 01:21:14.189]  I should remember it, but I mean, that's just how crazy all this has gotten.
[01:21:14.209 --> 01:21:14.689]  What's it called?
[01:21:18.007 --> 01:21:20.771]  InfoWars emergency election sale total blowout.
[01:21:21.492 --> 01:21:27.981]  But what it really is is, if you want to get t-shirts, books, films, and funnels in the future, we might not be able to sell you stuff soon.
[01:21:28.001 --> 01:21:30.804]  Because let me tell you, this is deep state stuff, folks.
[01:21:31.684 --> 01:21:47.611]  Your orders are all secure, we've got the products ready to ship to you, but the 20 different types of hack attacks a day, and the CNN with drones above the building, and cars following us around, and death-threatening everyone, and offering people money to lie about us, and the FBI controlled by the Democrats following us.
[01:21:47.691 --> 01:21:48.512]  I mean, it's a war.
[01:21:49.292 --> 01:21:50.512]  And they're doing all this to Trump, too.
[01:21:50.833 --> 01:21:53.114]  I'm not up here whining, I'm just saying, we're in a war, baby.
[01:21:53.674 --> 01:21:55.415]  The average person in the middle of this doesn't know.
[01:21:55.595 --> 01:21:56.835]  It's incredible.
[01:21:57.496 --> 01:21:58.056]  What's going on?
[01:21:59.468 --> 01:22:00.589]  So now I'm ranting and I'm going to stop.
[01:22:00.609 --> 01:22:01.930]  I'm going to stop right there and go to your calls.
[01:22:03.070 --> 01:22:08.534]  Just if you ever wanted that InfoWars t-shirt, ever wanted that Booker film, ever wanted to get those supplements, I would get them now.
[01:22:09.734 --> 01:22:20.421]  Because I was in an hour-long meeting this morning just deciding if I'm going to reorder a lot of products and spend money we've got to then get something in six, eight weeks to even, I mean, we're down to that level.
[01:22:20.461 --> 01:22:25.224]  Like a farmer goes, do I take the money we've got and buy seed money for next year or do I sell the farm?
[01:22:25.945 --> 01:22:27.286]  Well, I'm not selling the farm, folks.
[01:22:27.386 --> 01:22:27.806]  It's just that
[01:22:30.407 --> 01:22:31.707]  It won't matter if the farm goes under.
[01:22:31.727 --> 01:22:33.828]  It's like you don't sell it, well then it just goes under.
[01:22:33.888 --> 01:22:34.748]  You know what I mean?
[01:22:34.788 --> 01:22:37.429]  You get to that point where you got to make a decision.
[01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:40.009]  And I'll still be on air and still do a show as a level website.
[01:22:40.369 --> 01:22:46.291]  It's just the reporters and the crew and the bandwidth and the satellite uplinks and all this stuff I do that costs millions and millions of dollars.
[01:22:46.751 --> 01:22:49.571]  We can't do it like that if you don't support us.
[01:22:49.591 --> 01:22:50.192]  So I love you.
[01:22:50.472 --> 01:22:51.252]  We're not going under.
[01:22:51.472 --> 01:22:52.992]  We can go another six, seven months.
[01:22:53.092 --> 01:22:56.273]  It's just that because we're selling everything out and not buying more of it.
[01:22:57.230 --> 01:22:57.790]  You got that?
[01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:58.771]  That's where we're at right now.
[01:22:58.791 --> 01:23:01.794]  I need more money to order more product to go into the future.
[01:23:02.354 --> 01:23:06.017]  In fact, God, I'm always so long-winded, because I just look into my mind and just say what I'm seeing.
[01:23:07.158 --> 01:23:09.140]  This is the simple 30-second, then I'll go to your calls.
[01:23:11.501 --> 01:23:18.327]  Going forward into the future, we have some financing issues, and we're living off product that we're selling now, but not reordering.
[01:23:18.567 --> 01:23:22.390]  And that's not a good position to be in for continued resistance.
[01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:25.573]  So please step up and buy the products.
[01:23:26.949 --> 01:23:28.630]  So that we can buy products into the future.
[01:23:29.730 --> 01:23:32.712]  And my own brain goes, then don't sell it at 50, 60% off Jones.
[01:23:32.752 --> 01:23:33.652]  That doesn't make much money.
[01:23:33.933 --> 01:23:35.293]  Well, you only buy it when it's at that.
[01:23:35.333 --> 01:23:39.075]  So I put myself in this position and it's just all up to God, what's going to happen.
[01:23:39.255 --> 01:23:42.037]  You can also go to InfoWorksStore.com in the support area.
[01:23:43.277 --> 01:23:44.958]  You can click on that and make a pure donation.
[01:23:45.258 --> 01:23:47.479]  After credit card fees and stuff, we make 95% of it.
[01:23:49.542 --> 01:23:51.443]  Not 30, 40% like on the products.
[01:23:51.763 --> 01:23:55.765]  And then that's pure money to keep this going and do what we're doing, folks.
[01:23:56.206 --> 01:23:58.727]  And believe me, we're not just talking to you, and you're important.
[01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:07.372]  We are reaching out to the world and creating countervailing talking points.
[01:24:07.412 --> 01:24:08.472]  The New World Order, they're amazing.
[01:24:08.492 --> 01:24:09.593]  All right, enough about us.
[01:24:10.333 --> 01:24:11.274]  I've gone ahead and said it.
[01:24:12.034 --> 01:24:12.875]  That's what's going on.
[01:24:13.675 --> 01:24:14.356]  That's what's happening.
[01:24:14.396 --> 01:24:16.577]  And I didn't want to announce what was going on until we had backups.
[01:24:18.615 --> 01:24:21.176]  But then they can take those away, and then they know what to go after.
[01:24:21.516 --> 01:24:22.836]  But at some point, I gotta tell you.
[01:24:22.856 --> 01:24:23.996]  So I did it, and that's it.
[01:24:25.536 --> 01:24:27.437]  I'm not one for keeping stuff secret.
[01:24:28.497 --> 01:24:33.038]  Mike, Henry, Travis, Jim, Joshua, Kevin, who's been holding longest here?
[01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:39.760]  Yes, that'd be Kevin in Canada.
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:40.360]  Go ahead, Kevin.
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:40.920]  Thanks for calling.
[01:24:42.260 --> 01:24:42.680]  Hey, Alex.
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:43.340]  How you doing, man?
[01:24:43.780 --> 01:24:45.841]  In the middle of the second American Revolution, baby.
[01:24:45.881 --> 01:24:46.321]  This is it.
[01:24:47.301 --> 01:24:47.962]  Yeah, baby!
[01:24:47.982 --> 01:25:02.515]  I just do that because it makes me feel good, like, I just want George Soros to know!
[01:25:02.535 --> 01:25:06.839]  Atta boy!
[01:25:07.319 --> 01:25:07.700]  Atta boy!
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.943]  I'm calling from behind enemy lines in Alberta, Canada.
[01:25:11.203 --> 01:25:12.024]  Globalist control.
[01:25:13.237 --> 01:25:16.718]  And I'm calling in today because of the flu shots the media is pushing right now.
[01:25:16.918 --> 01:25:20.859]  And I saw a video yesterday on the show, if I were the devil, you know, what would I do?
[01:25:21.819 --> 01:25:24.540]  And if I were the devil or the globalist, what would I do?
[01:25:24.580 --> 01:25:33.702]  Well, I'd push a flu shot this season to scare everybody into submission to getting a flu shot, because a lot of people are woken up now about COVID-19 and rushed vaccines.
[01:25:34.402 --> 01:25:39.923]  So I think this, that would be my play if I were a globalist, would be to push a flu, a flu shot, push it on the public.
[01:25:40.663 --> 01:25:42.584]  And they'd, oh, well, you know, got to get that flu shot.
[01:25:43.434 --> 01:25:44.275]  Uh, you know, stay safe.
[01:26:02.472 --> 01:26:03.273]  That's right, that's right.
[01:26:03.293 --> 01:26:07.116]  And also in Canada now, they're really pushing the pharmacies to do in-house testing.
[01:26:07.656 --> 01:26:11.099]  So you're going to see a massive spike in cases, not deaths, of course.
[01:26:11.159 --> 01:26:14.843]  I mean, it's all, you know... They now admit 90% of the tests are fake.
[01:26:14.943 --> 01:26:15.923]  Oh, it's total crap.
[01:26:16.364 --> 01:26:16.544]  Yep.
[01:26:16.844 --> 01:26:17.225]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:26:17.245 --> 01:26:17.865]  Love what you do.
[01:26:17.945 --> 01:26:19.607]  Buy some Vitamin Fusion, guys.
[01:26:19.627 --> 01:26:20.808]  It's the best stuff on the product.
[01:26:20.828 --> 01:26:21.508]  God bless you.
[01:26:21.528 --> 01:26:22.649]  I hate coming to you guys for help.
[01:26:22.749 --> 01:26:28.014]  You just... Most people are financed with banker money, fiat garbage, unlimited cash.
[01:26:28.454 --> 01:26:28.794]  We're not.
[01:26:28.814 --> 01:26:30.396]  We're financed by you, so I just appreciate you all.
[01:26:31.096 --> 01:26:32.616]  I hate coming to you and begging for support.
[01:26:33.016 --> 01:26:38.178]  Hell, half of me wants to get shut down and I don't have to do this anymore, but then I gotta watch the contact tracers come to my house, you know what I mean?
[01:26:38.198 --> 01:26:40.558]  Like, snap, you're inside the bear trap, you know what I mean?
[01:26:40.578 --> 01:26:42.719]  Like, we're not getting out of this without a fight, folks.
[01:26:43.239 --> 01:26:45.539]  Let's go to another caller real quick in the minute that we have.
[01:26:46.119 --> 01:26:48.160]  Let's go ahead and talk to another caller in Canada.
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:49.600]  Mike in Canada, go ahead.
[01:26:51.481 --> 01:26:52.621]  Hey Alex, can you hear me?
[01:26:52.801 --> 01:26:53.381]  Yes sir, go ahead.
[01:26:54.335 --> 01:26:56.316]  Yeah, first time caller, long time listener.
[01:26:56.596 --> 01:26:58.996]  I'm calling about an important topic.
[01:26:59.176 --> 01:27:05.238]  It's the Alberta Public Health Act that was passed in July of 2020 of this year.
[01:27:05.718 --> 01:27:11.099]  The plan entails a forceful detainment and isolation of Canadian citizens.
[01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:12.460]  Section 30 entails
[01:27:14.153 --> 01:27:28.665]  A plan for entry of examination that states where a medical officer of health knows or has reason to believe that a person is suffering from a communicable disease referred to in section 20 may be found in a place or that a place may be contaminated.
[01:27:28.825 --> 01:27:32.789]  Henry, I'm gonna, or Mike, I'm gonna hold you over then we'll go to Henry, but let me explain something.
[01:27:34.110 --> 01:27:52.416]  I don't know if you saw us, like last week, we played the clip of the Quebec City guy drooling how they're bringing you in control to come in your houses door to door, take your children, force-inoculate you once the shots begin, and they have a secret FEMA, for Canada, a secret federal emergency center that they're taking people to.
[01:27:52.456 --> 01:27:53.156]  Did you see that part?
[01:27:54.218 --> 01:28:05.071]  Yes sir, and in this plan it details, it says that the lieutenant governor in council here in Alberta has the authority to postpone elections up to three months.
[01:28:05.592 --> 01:28:08.656]  Stay there, stay there, exactly, and what's the key kids?
[01:28:09.316 --> 01:28:10.318]  What's the key dad?
[01:28:10.378 --> 01:28:11.018]  What's the key mom?
[01:28:12.205 --> 01:28:13.106]  It's all U.N.
[01:28:13.166 --> 01:28:15.427]  run, just like Australia, just like Spain.
[01:28:15.467 --> 01:28:16.228]  Now to Canada.
[01:28:16.528 --> 01:28:18.909]  Ohio's doing it under their Republican leadership.
[01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:20.130]  This is it.
[01:28:20.210 --> 01:28:21.391]  This is the takeover.
[01:28:21.631 --> 01:28:23.873]  This is martial law with a medical tyranny cover.
[01:28:24.253 --> 01:28:24.753]  This is it.
[01:28:25.333 --> 01:28:26.274]  This is it, boys.
[01:28:28.355 --> 01:28:29.676]  Screaming in vengeance.
[01:28:30.497 --> 01:28:32.098]  It's the Alex Jones Broadcast.
[01:28:37.932 --> 01:28:43.156]  Alright, I'm aware of what's going on in multiple states of Canada and what's going on in Europe, but I've still dropped the ball.
[01:28:44.157 --> 01:28:50.622]  I saw the video last week of Quebec City, the health minister, just acting like a villain from a G.I.
[01:28:50.682 --> 01:28:52.123]  Joe Cobra Commander movie.
[01:28:52.143 --> 01:28:54.525]  I mean, rubbing hands together.
[01:28:54.685 --> 01:28:55.726]  Oh, it's excellent.
[01:28:55.946 --> 01:28:58.308]  We'll take everyone and put them in secret facilities.
[01:28:58.588 --> 01:29:00.089]  The police are following orders.
[01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:01.971]  Well, the U.N.
[01:29:02.011 --> 01:29:03.012]  is pleased with us.
[01:29:03.902 --> 01:29:04.522]  And I've got the U.N.
[01:29:04.562 --> 01:29:08.023]  menace that says, oh, we break up the families.
[01:29:08.043 --> 01:29:10.403]  They want that power to come and take you away.
[01:29:10.423 --> 01:29:13.964]  This is the cover for their final political solution.
[01:29:14.704 --> 01:29:16.824]  So tell people where you're at, the name of the document.
[01:29:16.844 --> 01:29:17.345]  I'm aware of it.
[01:29:17.385 --> 01:29:18.345]  I saw the link last week.
[01:29:18.385 --> 01:29:19.005]  I didn't cover it.
[01:29:19.365 --> 01:29:21.105]  Because I'm just up here going, they're coming to round you up.
[01:29:21.165 --> 01:29:23.726]  And it's like, this is all happening.
[01:29:23.766 --> 01:29:26.926]  The epic biblicalness of this is just happening, Mike.
[01:29:27.266 --> 01:29:27.987]  And people aren't aware.
[01:29:28.007 --> 01:29:29.967]  So tell them where they find it, what the document is.
[01:29:30.527 --> 01:29:31.607]  Suspending elections.
[01:29:31.647 --> 01:29:32.628]  This is martial law.
[01:29:33.048 --> 01:29:43.172]  Institutional martial law under the UN Global Governance dictating what the cities and states can do, giving the political cover for absolute evil.
[01:29:44.872 --> 01:29:46.613]  This is exactly as you stated.
[01:29:46.633 --> 01:29:50.574]  The UN's plan to come in and detain people and take them from their homes.
[01:29:51.014 --> 01:29:52.815]  This is the execution of that plan.
[01:29:53.294 --> 01:30:07.521]  This can be found in the Public Health Act right on the Government of Alberta's website, which clearly states that the Lieutenant Governor-in-Council now has the authority to order the immunization or re-immunization of persons that are not immunized.
[01:30:08.001 --> 01:30:15.005]  And if you do not... So, so, so, so, the Public Health Act of Alberta, forced inoculation, secret arrest, secret detainment.
[01:30:16.309 --> 01:30:17.671]  100%, that is correct.
[01:30:17.791 --> 01:30:21.474]  And if you do not comply, they have a contingency in there for you as well.
[01:30:21.534 --> 01:30:27.179]  They'll detain you and throw you in a facility indefinitely, essentially, until you're compliant.
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:40.012]  And in coordination with this, I see on the Government of Canada Procurement website that they've put out an RFP, a proposal, for 36,000 tear gas canister agents.
[01:30:40.112 --> 01:30:41.353]  This is a riot control agent.
[01:30:44.465 --> 01:30:46.087]  There's no doubt they're making their move.
[01:30:46.227 --> 01:30:48.149]  They're going to make their move here in the United States.
[01:30:48.169 --> 01:30:52.695]  They're going to use COVID as the cover for martial law and race riots as the cover for martial law.
[01:30:53.095 --> 01:30:54.296]  What do you think we should do?
[01:30:54.357 --> 01:30:55.177]  What should Trump do?
[01:30:55.458 --> 01:30:58.241]  I think he should assault this head on, call it all out.
[01:30:58.561 --> 01:31:00.143]  I know the White House is watching right now.
[01:31:00.664 --> 01:31:01.825]  What are they going to do about this?
[01:31:01.845 --> 01:31:03.047]  They need to call it out now.
[01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:05.231]  I don't know.
[01:31:25.125 --> 01:31:26.045]  Enslave us.
[01:31:26.165 --> 01:31:31.366]  Anybody tries to take me to some secret center for forced inoculation, they want to plunge their poison in me.
[01:31:31.406 --> 01:31:32.607]  That's a physical assault.
[01:31:32.827 --> 01:31:33.807]  I'm going to defend myself.
[01:31:34.127 --> 01:31:38.988]  They're the ones assaulting us and they want to do it bureaucratically and poison us and kill us that way.
[01:31:39.008 --> 01:31:39.748]  That's what they want to do.
[01:31:40.268 --> 01:31:42.428]  No, you will not kill us, you little maggots!
[01:31:44.169 --> 01:31:48.590]  Well, that's right, Alex, and all the while... By the way, go back to that.
[01:31:49.010 --> 01:31:49.910]  England just passed
[01:31:52.594 --> 01:31:54.697]  $13,000 fines for not staying locked up in your house.
[01:31:55.198 --> 01:31:57.160]  Now Canada, $569,000 fines?
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:31:57.781]  What the hell is that?
[01:31:57.821 --> 01:31:58.682]  That's out of KUT Austin.
[01:31:58.702 --> 01:32:00.845]  Holy mackerel.
[01:32:09.139 --> 01:32:16.186]  And on top of that, they're going to give us a year and a half to give up our guns or else come and forcefully buy them out.
[01:32:16.206 --> 01:32:19.669]  But see how, oh, it's 15 days just for the hospitals.
[01:32:19.709 --> 01:32:20.730]  Oh, it's two months.
[01:32:20.770 --> 01:32:21.530]  It's six months.
[01:32:21.871 --> 01:32:25.634]  Oh, now it's $750,000 fines they're now saying.
[01:32:26.075 --> 01:32:27.036]  That was an old article.
[01:32:27.376 --> 01:32:28.957]  I mean, it's just, boom, we're here.
[01:32:29.037 --> 01:32:29.418]  We're here.
[01:32:31.033 --> 01:32:33.597]  And this mask mandate has no end date.
[01:32:33.697 --> 01:32:34.598]  Keep that in mind.
[01:32:34.778 --> 01:32:36.981]  That they do not have an end date for this.
[01:32:37.302 --> 01:32:40.486]  But that said, how beautiful it is that people aren't wearing them at Trump rallies.
[01:32:40.506 --> 01:32:41.528]  Trump's coming out against it.
[01:32:41.808 --> 01:32:43.691]  We need to call its bluff now, brother.
[01:32:44.759 --> 01:32:47.580]  It's time to be lions in the herd of sheep.
[01:32:47.680 --> 01:32:53.122]  Walk out there, be proud of it, and stand up for your liberties that are being stripped from us on a daily basis.
[01:32:53.162 --> 01:32:53.702]  Mike, incredible.
[01:32:53.722 --> 01:32:55.623]  We're going to put this last segment and this one out.
[01:32:56.143 --> 01:33:03.105]  Really important piece to feature and show the documents you mentioned that Canada now under full martial law.
[01:33:04.025 --> 01:33:09.787]  Canada now to fine and arrest and engage in forced inoculations.
[01:33:09.827 --> 01:33:10.287]  My God.
[01:33:10.807 --> 01:33:11.848]  Jim McGriffin's coming up.
[01:33:11.868 --> 01:33:12.288]  Stay with us.
[01:33:15.623 --> 01:33:19.024]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[01:33:19.044 --> 01:33:20.205]  They're going to contest the election.
[01:33:20.225 --> 01:33:21.805]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[01:33:21.825 --> 01:33:23.326]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[01:33:23.426 --> 01:33:24.446]  I want them shut down.
[01:33:24.526 --> 01:33:25.426]  I want them silenced.
[01:33:25.466 --> 01:33:26.267]  I want them muted.
[01:33:26.327 --> 01:33:28.087]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[01:33:28.107 --> 01:33:29.068]  You kept us on air.
[01:33:29.188 --> 01:33:30.468]  We did the analysis first.
[01:33:30.748 --> 01:33:31.748]  It's now gone mainstream.
[01:33:31.808 --> 01:33:33.629]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[01:33:33.889 --> 01:33:39.831]  And what they've said directly to us is, you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[01:33:40.011 --> 01:33:41.472]  And you need to stop right now.
[01:33:41.552 --> 01:33:42.592]  And they're very, very serious.
[01:33:42.772 --> 01:33:45.093]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[01:33:45.453 --> 01:33:46.313]  This is not going to happen.
[01:33:46.333 --> 01:33:47.974]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[01:33:48.434 --> 01:33:49.534]  I used to say support InfoWars.
[01:33:49.994 --> 01:33:50.894]  Rescue InfoWars.
[01:33:50.974 --> 01:33:51.614]  Save yourself.
[01:33:51.974 --> 01:33:52.614]  Save the world.
[01:33:52.935 --> 01:33:53.795]  We're in this together.
[01:33:53.895 --> 01:33:55.535]  Because let me tell you something.
[01:33:55.555 --> 01:33:56.535]  Communism's up here.
[01:33:56.755 --> 01:33:59.696]  InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[01:34:00.076 --> 01:34:01.916]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[01:34:02.116 --> 01:34:03.657]  My children are right here!
[01:34:04.377 --> 01:34:06.117]  But I need money to fight a war!
[01:34:06.337 --> 01:34:07.378]  And I need word of mouth!
[01:34:07.598 --> 01:34:08.498]  And I need prayer!
[01:34:08.638 --> 01:34:09.598]  And I need action!
[01:34:09.978 --> 01:34:11.578]  Because that dam's going to come down!
[01:34:12.279 --> 01:34:14.239]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[01:34:15.233 --> 01:34:21.393]  When that sun is high... In that Texas sky...
[01:34:22.875 --> 01:34:27.717]  We'll be interviewing G. Edward Griffin, the icon, bigger than Ron Paul.
[01:34:27.737 --> 01:34:33.680]  It's not about how big you are, but around before Ron Paul, making films in the 60s, exposing everything that happened.
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:41.083]  And the communist takeover of Africa, Asia, Latin America, a trailblazer that we all stand on his shoulders.
[01:34:41.143 --> 01:34:45.825]  G. Edward Griffin, redpillexpo.org, redpilluniversity.org.
[01:34:46.245 --> 01:34:48.366]  He's with us about 15 minutes into the next hour.
[01:34:50.816 --> 01:34:57.285]  I want to first get into Yuri Bezmenov, who is the KGB defector, who's now gone super viral yet again.
[01:34:57.305 --> 01:35:02.572]  I was playing this Yuri Bezmenov interview in 1996 on AXS TV.
[01:35:03.574 --> 01:35:04.836]  And Griffin was cool.
[01:35:04.856 --> 01:35:06.257]  He'd come on by 1997 on my radio show.
[01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:09.821]  Ideological subversion is the slow process
[01:35:32.119 --> 01:35:36.820]  Which we call either ideological subversion or active measures.
[01:35:37.040 --> 01:35:41.801]  Active measures in the language of the KGB or psychological warfare.
[01:35:42.301 --> 01:35:56.925]  What it basically means is to change the perception of reality of every American to such an extent that despite of the abundance of information no one is able to come to sensible conclusions
[01:35:57.921 --> 01:36:02.824]  In the interest of defending themselves, their families, their community and their country.
[01:36:04.084 --> 01:36:11.668]  It's a great brainwashing process which goes very slow and it's divided in four basic stages.
[01:36:13.589 --> 01:36:15.611]  The first one being demoralization.
[01:36:15.771 --> 01:36:18.772]  It takes from 15 to 20 years to demoralize a nation.
[01:36:19.293 --> 01:36:20.173]  Why that many years?
[01:36:20.913 --> 01:36:27.017]  Because this is the minimum number of years which requires to educate one generation of students
[01:36:28.214 --> 01:36:34.236]  In the country of your enemy, exposed to the ideology of the enemy.
[01:36:34.536 --> 01:36:48.402]  In other words, Marxism-Leninism ideology is being pumped into the soft heads of at least three generations of American students, without being challenged or counterbalanced by the basic values of Americanism, American patriotism.
[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:56.988]  The demoralization process in the United States is basically completed already for the last 25 years.
[01:36:57.769 --> 01:37:10.523]  Actually, it's over-fulfilled because demoralization now reaches such areas where previously not even Comrade Andropov and all his experts would even dream of such a tremendous success.
[01:37:11.224 --> 01:37:16.252]  Most of it is done by Americans to Americans, thanks to lack of moral standards.
[01:37:16.513 --> 01:37:22.563]  As I mentioned before, exposure to true information does not matter anymore.
[01:37:23.544 --> 01:37:25.147]  A person who was demoralized
[01:37:26.024 --> 01:37:28.526]  He is unable to assess true information.
[01:37:28.566 --> 01:37:31.029]  The facts tell nothing to him.
[01:37:32.190 --> 01:37:49.786]  Even if I shower him with information, with authentic proof, with documents, with pictures, even if I take him by force to the Soviet Union and show him concentration camp, he will refuse to believe it until he is going to receive a kick in his fat bottom.
[01:37:50.487 --> 01:37:55.329]  When a military boot crashes his balls, then he will understand, but not before that.
[01:37:55.369 --> 01:37:57.850]  That's the tragic of the situation of demoralization.
[01:37:59.131 --> 01:38:01.031]  The next stage is destabilization.
[01:38:01.692 --> 01:38:06.954]  This time, subverter does not care about your ideas and the patterns of your consumption.
[01:38:07.274 --> 01:38:10.676]  Whether you eat junk food and get fat and flabby doesn't matter anymore.
[01:38:11.256 --> 01:38:15.317]  This time, and it takes only from two to five years to destabilize a nation,
[01:38:17.739 --> 01:38:19.080]  What matters is essentials.
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:22.302]  Economy, foreign relations, defense systems.
[01:38:24.044 --> 01:38:39.035]  And you can see it quite clearly that in some areas, in such sensitive areas as defense and economy, the influence of Marxist-Leninist ideas in the United States is absolutely fantastic.
[01:38:39.456 --> 01:38:46.141]  I could never believe it 14 years ago when I landed in this part of the world that the process will go that fast.
[01:38:47.712 --> 01:38:49.313]  The next stage, of course, is crisis.
[01:38:49.833 --> 01:38:54.395]  It may take only up to six weeks to bring a country to the verge of crisis.
[01:38:54.635 --> 01:38:56.596]  You can see it in Central America now.
[01:38:57.397 --> 01:39:05.420]  And after crisis, with a violent change of power, structure, and economy, you have so-called the period of normalization.
[01:39:05.600 --> 01:39:06.881]  It may last indefinitely.
[01:39:07.458 --> 01:39:11.240]  Normalization is a cynical expression borrowed from Soviet propaganda.
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:20.385]  When the Soviet tanks moved into Czechoslovakia in 1968, Comrade Brezhnev said, now the situation in brotherly Czechoslovakia is normalized.
[01:39:21.005 --> 01:39:25.968]  This is what will happen in the United States if you allow all these schmucks to bring the country to crisis.
[01:39:27.216 --> 01:39:46.627]  To promise people all kinds of goodies and the paradise on earth, to destabilize your economy, to eliminate the principle of free market competition, and to put a big brother government in Washington DC with benevolent dictators like Walter Mondale,
[01:39:47.287 --> 01:39:51.932]  Who will promise lots of things, never mind whether the promises are fulfillable or not.
[01:39:52.693 --> 01:40:06.628]  Your leftists in the United States, all these professors and all these beautiful civil rights defenders, they are instrumental in the process of the subversion, only to destabilize the nation.
[01:40:07.734 --> 01:40:11.299]  When their job is completed, they are not needed anymore.
[01:40:11.519 --> 01:40:12.520]  They know too much.
[01:40:13.121 --> 01:40:19.730]  Some of them, when they get disillusioned, when they see that Marxist-Leninists come to power, obviously they get offended.
[01:40:20.271 --> 01:40:22.053]  They think that they will come to power.
[01:40:22.293 --> 01:40:23.575]  That will never happen, of course.
[01:40:23.755 --> 01:40:25.676]  They will be lined up against the wall and shot.
[01:40:26.357 --> 01:40:31.881]  But they may turn into the most bitter enemies of Marxist-Leninists when they come to power.
[01:40:32.141 --> 01:40:33.642]  And that's what happened in Nicaragua.
[01:40:33.762 --> 01:40:42.027]  You remember most of these former Marxist-Leninists were either put to prison or one of them split and now he's working against Sandinistas.
[01:40:42.488 --> 01:40:47.371]  It happened in Grenada when Maurice Bichot, he was already a Marxist.
[01:40:47.711 --> 01:40:51.634]  He was executed by a new Marxist who was more Marxist than this Marxist.
[01:40:52.114 --> 01:40:59.339]  Same happened in Afghanistan when first there was Taraki, he was killed by Amin, then Amin was killed by Babrak Karmal with the help of KGB.
[01:40:59.819 --> 01:41:09.086]  Same happened in Bangladesh when Mujibur Rahman, very pro-Soviet leftist, was assassinated by his own Marxist-Leninist military comrades.
[01:41:09.866 --> 01:41:11.387]  It's the same pattern everywhere.
[01:41:12.548 --> 01:41:14.890]  The time bomb is ticking with every second.
[01:41:16.004 --> 01:41:16.544]  It's closer.
[01:41:16.564 --> 01:41:17.985]  Yuri Bezmenov.
[01:41:18.025 --> 01:41:19.466]  That's an interview from 1984.
[01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:23.348]  Of course, Griffin did interviews back in the early 1960s, mid-60s with everybody.
[01:41:23.748 --> 01:41:25.849]  He joins us for the next hour, 15 minutes to the next hour.
[01:41:25.889 --> 01:41:26.790]  We really appreciate him.
[01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:30.572]  Hearing all that is exactly what's happening, but the reason I wanted to get him on today
[01:41:31.377 --> 01:41:32.198]  Let's explain.
[01:41:32.438 --> 01:41:43.247]  We're not giving the Russians cover for what they did, but it was a globalist Rothschild banking cartel that put this in Russia as its beta test to exploit Russia to expand this.
[01:41:44.108 --> 01:41:47.271]  And so that's why it's done so well here, because it actually came from here.
[01:41:47.631 --> 01:41:48.692]  You talk about trailblazing.
[01:41:48.752 --> 01:41:52.656]  G. Edward Griffin is the trailblazer exposing the whole paradigm.
[01:41:53.096 --> 01:41:55.118]  G. Edward Griffin, thank you so much, my friend, for joining us.
[01:41:56.325 --> 01:41:57.606]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:41:57.686 --> 01:42:01.409]  It's always a pleasure to be on your show and to get your perspective on things.
[01:42:03.131 --> 01:42:08.395]  Well, I'm going to try to give you the floor when we come back, and you can talk about any subject you want, but I'd like to go back into history.
[01:42:09.076 --> 01:42:20.725]  Why the ultra-rich, as Dundare called it, conspiracy exposes, which you even predate, are funding communism so people can get the paradigm shift and then look at the current situation.
[01:42:21.006 --> 01:42:22.567]  What else do you want to get into today?
[01:42:24.796 --> 01:42:27.679]  I think that's quite enough because that's a deep topic.
[01:42:28.440 --> 01:42:43.794]  When you touched on the idea that it was the so-called anti-communist or non-communist world that actually funded the communist revolution, a lot of people have come to realize that now, but I'm not sure they understand the significance of that.
[01:42:44.214 --> 01:42:47.678]  When you realize that the money for sending Lenin
[01:42:51.963 --> 01:42:57.268]  The revolution against the czar, that money came from Wall Street and from the city in London.
[01:42:57.949 --> 01:43:04.275]  It came from very, very, very wealthy people, the kind of people we would tend to call capitalists.
[01:43:05.076 --> 01:43:12.183]  That's another topic because I want to just emphasize that the amount of money a person has is not a measure of what they believe.
[01:43:12.863 --> 01:43:15.325]  So, a very rich person can be a communist.
[01:43:15.705 --> 01:43:16.766]  It's a... Exactly!
[01:43:16.946 --> 01:43:18.508]  It's a spiritual thing at the end of the day.
[01:43:18.548 --> 01:43:19.188]  G. Edward Griffin.
[01:43:19.428 --> 01:43:20.589]  And I'm here looking at G. Edward Griffin.
[01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:23.171]  You know, I got a chance to meet all these big Hollywood stars.
[01:43:23.311 --> 01:43:23.972]  I care less about them.
[01:43:24.332 --> 01:43:25.193]  I even know Donald Trump.
[01:43:25.213 --> 01:43:26.073]  Okay, okay, big deal.
[01:43:26.314 --> 01:43:27.334]  I'm looking at G. Edward Griffin.
[01:43:27.354 --> 01:43:28.976]  A living legend there on Skype.
[01:43:29.036 --> 01:43:29.776]  Like, he's right there.
[01:43:30.297 --> 01:43:32.378]  And without him, we would not even be where we are.
[01:43:32.518 --> 01:43:32.939]  Literally.
[01:43:33.319 --> 01:43:35.340]  This guy's one of the few people early on to expose it.
[01:43:35.360 --> 01:43:36.321]  We are so honored to have him.
[01:43:36.702 --> 01:43:38.283]  This guy's a rock star for humanity.
[01:43:40.051 --> 01:43:41.032]  And we are back live.
[01:43:41.112 --> 01:43:42.212]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:43:42.272 --> 01:43:48.035]  G. Edward Griffin, bestselling author, researcher, patriot with redpilluniversity.org is our guest here.
[01:43:48.055 --> 01:43:50.136]  15 minutes to the next hour.
[01:43:52.337 --> 01:43:59.941]  But seriously, I was singling out G. Edward Griffin earlier and how important he is for all of our futures because it needs to be singled out.
[01:43:59.981 --> 01:44:05.264]  They celebrate LeBron James, they celebrate Roger Stolbeck, they celebrate things artificially
[01:44:06.226 --> 01:44:07.127]  Because they don't matter.
[01:44:07.747 --> 01:44:18.117]  Instead of what was it like back in the mid-1960s when he woke up and then became one of the main voices or progenitors of the modern resistance to globalism.
[01:44:18.357 --> 01:44:30.328]  And what is it like out of thousands of political ideologies the globalists fund to confuse people with their Tower of Babel to have been there accurately forecasting who the players were, what the battle space was, and how they could be defeated.
[01:44:31.345 --> 01:44:32.746]  I mean, this is vindication.
[01:44:32.786 --> 01:44:35.749]  People say, Jones, you've been on air 26 years, you're so vindicated.
[01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:45.518]  Well, because I was reading the work of G. Edward Griffin and of many, many others that came before, and that's why we're here.
[01:44:45.598 --> 01:44:54.827]  So this is a shorter segment, long segment coming up, but if you can, go back to your roots and what woke you up and then contemporize what the main players are as you did
[01:44:56.335 --> 01:45:04.222]  50, 60 years ago and then let's move forward with the breakdown of exactly who we're facing because knowing who the enemy is is half the battle.
[01:45:08.345 --> 01:45:10.607]  Well, uh, I guess that's my cue.
[01:45:10.627 --> 01:45:15.671]  I was sort of looking at that old video thinking how young I was.
[01:45:17.092 --> 01:45:20.535]  But anyway, how long have you been in this fight?
[01:45:23.497 --> 01:45:24.798]  I took my first red pill in 1960.
[01:45:27.438 --> 01:45:28.378]  So that's quite wild.
[01:45:28.758 --> 01:45:29.419]  Let's start there.
[01:45:30.479 --> 01:45:31.439]  Yeah, we can start there.
[01:45:31.499 --> 01:45:35.360]  Well, I was climbing the corporate ladder.
[01:45:35.861 --> 01:45:38.441]  I was like a lot of other young people are all the time.
[01:45:38.481 --> 01:45:40.542]  They're trying to look good, trying to do well.
[01:45:41.102 --> 01:45:49.505]  Had a small family and a beautiful wife and a couple of kids and I wanted to do something that was fun.
[01:45:49.685 --> 01:45:51.585]  I wanted to have all the good things.
[01:45:51.665 --> 01:45:55.506]  I wanted to climb into the corporate world and become an executive.
[01:45:55.566 --> 01:45:56.707]  I wanted to have money and travel.
[01:45:57.841 --> 01:46:01.302]  You know, looking good and adding all the good material things.
[01:46:02.322 --> 01:46:13.824]  And it was a very shallow existence, looking back at it, but then I stumbled across some information, a little pamphlet that I picked up somewhere, written by a college professor in some Midwestern university, and it was critical of the United Nations.
[01:46:13.864 --> 01:46:14.564]  And I thought, what?
[01:46:14.704 --> 01:46:16.365]  How can you be critical of the United Nations?
[01:46:16.945 --> 01:46:22.546]  I just came out of the university and I was taught that the United Nations was our last, best hope for peace.
[01:46:23.126 --> 01:46:23.926]  So I believed that.
[01:46:24.286 --> 01:46:27.507]  So how could anybody find anything wrong with our last, best hope for peace?
[01:46:28.348 --> 01:46:36.011]  So anyway, I don't want to make a big story out of that because that's all ancient history, but that was the first crack in the egg and I began to do some independent research.
[01:46:36.051 --> 01:46:40.152]  And the amazing thing, Alex, I discovered something about myself that I didn't know.
[01:46:40.172 --> 01:46:44.694]  I discovered that I had a crusader gene and it started to vibrate.
[01:46:45.154 --> 01:46:47.255]  And the minute I discovered that I was being fooled,
[01:46:47.873 --> 01:46:53.217]  That everything, not everything at that time, but now I know almost everything I thought was real was false.
[01:46:53.258 --> 01:47:01.684]  But when I discovered that I had been lied to about the UN and then I discovered I'd been lied to about something else and then something else, I became highly indignant.
[01:47:02.105 --> 01:47:05.788]  Instead of just going, sitting back on it and saying, well, gee, I wonder what's going to happen next.
[01:47:06.188 --> 01:47:06.969]  I got to learn more.
[01:47:07.289 --> 01:47:09.911]  I became angry and I said, I've got to do something about this.
[01:47:10.472 --> 01:47:11.913]  That was contrary to my style.
[01:47:12.705 --> 01:47:18.509]  So I quit my job and my poor wife thought she was going to die and said, how are we going to put groceries on the table?
[01:47:18.549 --> 01:47:19.469]  What happened to your career?
[01:47:19.890 --> 01:47:21.911]  You're out fighting communism.
[01:47:21.951 --> 01:47:23.332]  Nobody cares about communism.
[01:47:23.372 --> 01:47:24.192]  That's over there someplace.
[01:47:24.612 --> 01:47:26.394]  Anyway, that was how it all began.
[01:47:26.434 --> 01:47:29.055]  And just incrementally, I went downhill from there.
[01:47:29.836 --> 01:47:32.057]  I just couldn't resist learning more.
[01:47:32.097 --> 01:47:33.198]  And then once I had learned some,
[01:47:33.558 --> 01:47:36.463]  And you became a pretty big leader in the movement pretty fast, didn't you?
[01:47:47.461 --> 01:47:50.565]  Well, I guess, no, I don't think I became a big leader in the movement.
[01:47:50.585 --> 01:47:52.507]  I just became a small fry in the movement.
[01:47:52.527 --> 01:48:05.543]  In fact, I remember going to a lot of these patriotic meetings and informative meetings and I was always the youngest kid there and I was very young and all the old timers were up there in the dias and the speakers were the old
[01:48:06.284 --> 01:48:07.405]  People that knew things.
[01:48:07.505 --> 01:48:09.206]  I was just green behind the ears.
[01:48:09.266 --> 01:48:10.667]  I had learned one or two things.
[01:48:11.048 --> 01:48:12.769]  So I was not a leader at all.
[01:48:12.849 --> 01:48:14.110]  I was just doing my best.
[01:48:14.250 --> 01:48:22.155]  I look back on you fast doing film interviews back when that was so hard and huge films and just I mean you were but you hit the ground running.
[01:48:22.215 --> 01:48:24.117]  I mean you were doing amazing stuff.
[01:48:25.851 --> 01:48:28.091]  Well, I did hit the ground running, that's for sure.
[01:48:28.511 --> 01:48:36.993]  But, you know, I forgot about those old films, and somebody called me a few months ago and said, you know, your interview with Yuri Bezmenov is going viral.
[01:48:37.113 --> 01:48:37.713]  I said, oh, it is?
[01:48:37.833 --> 01:48:38.513]  I didn't know that.
[01:48:39.133 --> 01:48:49.935]  And then somebody called me a few weeks later and said, yeah, somebody pulled up your lecture on More Deadly Than War, which was an analysis of this revolutionary tactics that we see in our streets now.
[01:48:50.355 --> 01:48:52.015]  Not only in our streets, but in our colleges.
[01:48:52.035 --> 01:48:55.576]  He made films like Katanga and all those that are incredible.
[01:48:57.220 --> 01:48:59.041]  Yeah, well, that's what I was doing.
[01:48:59.061 --> 01:49:02.942]  I had learned in school a little bit about filmmaking and communications.
[01:49:03.402 --> 01:49:13.024]  I had thought originally I was going to make that my career, but that didn't pay out because there were people with far more talent than mine wasting their lives in Hollywood waiting for a big chance.
[01:49:13.624 --> 01:49:15.205]  And so I said, well, I got to get on with life.
[01:49:15.245 --> 01:49:16.405]  I got a family to support.
[01:49:16.485 --> 01:49:19.846]  So that's when I went into the corporate world.
[01:49:20.086 --> 01:49:24.167]  But I did have some knowledge and training and aptitude for communication.
[01:49:24.187 --> 01:49:25.007]  So I thought, well, I'll take
[01:49:25.947 --> 01:49:30.749]  I know you want to talk about yourself all day.
[01:49:30.789 --> 01:49:39.332]  It's just important to know the roots of this because I've tracked the resistance and your work, you know, inspired Barry Goldwater, Ronald Reagan, Ron Paul, so many others.
[01:49:39.392 --> 01:49:41.592]  I mean, you've been, I mean, how's it feel?
[01:49:41.653 --> 01:49:46.494]  It's got to be satisfying to know you were, you've been a key and still been pertinent today.
[01:49:46.874 --> 01:49:51.536]  You've been a key bomb thrower in the resistance to communism and tyranny for
[01:49:52.456 --> 01:49:52.976]  50, 60 years.
[01:49:53.016 --> 01:49:54.077]  That's gotta be satisfying.
[01:49:54.117 --> 01:49:57.918]  I mean, without you, brother, we would not be in the position we are now, having a fighting chance.
[01:49:57.938 --> 01:49:59.659]  I can tell you that, G. Edward.
[01:49:59.919 --> 01:50:02.420]  Without you, you've been the key man so far.
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:03.481]  People give me that credit?
[01:50:03.501 --> 01:50:04.481]  Yeah.
[01:50:04.701 --> 01:50:05.882]  1996 forward, we've been key.
[01:50:06.102 --> 01:50:08.083]  But you, brother, we're patient zero.
[01:50:08.103 --> 01:50:08.583]  We salute you.
[01:50:10.012 --> 01:50:11.353]  Well, thank you for that, Alex.
[01:50:11.393 --> 01:50:14.775]  I don't feel any more worthy than anybody else in the trenches.
[01:50:15.355 --> 01:50:18.617]  I've had many years to pursue it.
[01:50:18.637 --> 01:50:20.618]  That makes a big difference, too.
[01:50:21.978 --> 01:50:24.340]  Things are partially due to chance.
[01:50:24.420 --> 01:50:29.062]  If somebody had not discovered my old videos, someone had taken it.
[01:50:29.282 --> 01:50:31.783]  We used to sell those as VHS copies, you know, tapes.
[01:50:32.164 --> 01:50:34.985]  So if somebody had found one of those and digitized it, it wasn't me.
[01:50:35.325 --> 01:50:37.546]  No, no, I used to buy them and put them on AXS TV.
[01:50:37.587 --> 01:50:38.127]  Believe me, I know.
[01:50:39.264 --> 01:50:44.445]  Yeah, so you're the guy that really is responsible for all this because without that, nobody would have ever seen the thing.
[01:50:44.765 --> 01:50:46.505]  It would not have started to go viral.
[01:50:47.045 --> 01:50:48.906]  And yeah, there I am.
[01:50:50.206 --> 01:50:52.666]  That was, oh my gosh, I started to grow a beard by this time.
[01:50:53.107 --> 01:50:55.587]  So anyway, yeah, it was not just me.
[01:50:55.627 --> 01:51:05.869]  And I'm just trying to, I'm not just trying to play the... No, I know you're not about credit, but I want the new filmmaker or the new person out there listening to know that this has been a lonely fight, but it's had huge successes.
[01:51:05.909 --> 01:51:06.489]  That's all I'm saying.
[01:51:07.335 --> 01:51:33.352]  Yeah, and I think there's encouragement from that because no matter what we do and no matter how much we seem to be ignored or scoffed at because our position is not mainstream, if you just stick with it and don't yield and say, okay, that's my mission is to be a truth teller, sooner or later it'll come around and even right now we seem to think that the affairs of the world are moving so badly downward that we're going to hit bottom and we may.
[01:51:34.577 --> 01:51:47.187]  I don't care in spite of no matter how hard the hit is, the truth will bounce back and it's our job to do our best no matter what the condition is because in the long run, the long
[01:51:50.282 --> 01:51:52.305]  It's our responsibility to make sure that that happens.
[01:51:52.765 --> 01:51:53.306]  Exactly.
[01:51:53.366 --> 01:52:02.138]  And compare you to Joe Biden, it's night and day, the accumulated gravitas, the understanding of the truth versus the system that is just out of gas.
[01:52:02.158 --> 01:52:03.480]  We'll come back with Jim Griffiths right ahead.
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:05.263]  I'm going to shut up now for the next four segments.
[01:52:06.206 --> 01:52:13.551]  Unfortunately, you've grown up hearing voices that incessantly warn of government as nothing more than some separate sinister entity that's at the root of all our problems.
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:39.021]  Some of these same voices also do their best to gum up the works.
[01:52:40.542 --> 01:52:43.204]  They'll warn that tyranny is always lurking just around the corner.
[01:52:45.865 --> 01:52:46.965]  You should reject these voices.
[01:52:48.586 --> 01:52:50.027]  So now we're under world government.
[01:52:50.067 --> 01:52:51.588]  We're told humans are non-essential.
[01:52:52.188 --> 01:52:53.809]  We're told we're going to give them forced inoculations.
[01:52:53.849 --> 01:52:56.570]  Gilbert Griffin has been totally vindicated.
[01:52:56.590 --> 01:52:58.011]  Again, I don't say this to praise him.
[01:52:58.671 --> 01:53:01.093]  We don't celebrate the fact that we were right enough.
[01:53:01.833 --> 01:53:03.694]  We've been right about the world government, the UN,
[01:53:06.744 --> 01:53:13.728]  CDC just apologized last night and said, well, the UN says COVID-19 is not airborne, even though all these flu viruses and cold viruses are.
[01:53:14.208 --> 01:53:18.930]  So since they said that to cover up for China, we're apologizing because they're the boss.
[01:53:19.050 --> 01:53:20.111]  Who made them God?
[01:53:21.672 --> 01:53:24.933]  This is such an illustration how we're under this UN world system.
[01:53:24.953 --> 01:53:32.957]  So now I'm going to shut up, Jaybird Griffin, get into the ultra-rich funding communism, how it really works, the UN, what the big plan is.
[01:53:32.997 --> 01:53:33.978]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:53:35.731 --> 01:53:36.811]  Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:53:36.931 --> 01:53:38.532]  I really didn't know what to expect today.
[01:53:38.552 --> 01:53:46.435]  And the idea that you want to just throw the ball and let me carry it wherever I want to go is kind of dangerous, because I don't really know where I'm going to go with this.
[01:53:47.056 --> 01:54:00.701]  I hadn't really thought about making a presentation, but I'm delighted to the opportunity because there was something you said early in the introduction that really caught my attention as possibly a theme to try to follow if I had the chance.
[01:54:01.001 --> 01:54:02.962]  And that was that back in the
[01:54:06.445 --> 01:54:13.107]  Really brought to the scene, funded by the elitists, the very wealthy, very, very, very wealthy people.
[01:54:13.947 --> 01:54:18.189]  These were the financial interests and the banking interests in New York City and in London.
[01:54:19.129 --> 01:54:25.811]  They were the ones that paid for Trotsky to go to, and Lenin, all these people.
[01:54:25.851 --> 01:54:27.792]  They took them into Russia.
[01:54:28.052 --> 01:54:28.792]  They're the ones that
[01:54:30.203 --> 01:54:32.264]  instigated the revolution and so forth.
[01:54:32.304 --> 01:54:39.989]  So that's an important fact that people increasingly know about but I don't think they've considered the significance of that.
[01:54:41.030 --> 01:54:52.998]  I think the significance was best described by, oh my golly, I thought I'd never forget his name, he was a professor that wrote a lot of books about communism.
[01:54:53.118 --> 01:54:54.919]  Anyway, the phrase is simply that
[01:54:56.087 --> 01:54:59.969]  Communism was the best enemy money could buy.
[01:54:59.989 --> 01:55:01.669]  Just think about that.
[01:55:01.689 --> 01:55:02.570]  It was a tricky title.
[01:55:02.590 --> 01:55:03.590]  You're supposed to think about it.
[01:55:03.910 --> 01:55:05.431]  The best enemy money can buy.
[01:55:06.351 --> 01:55:08.792]  The idea that somebody would want an enemy.
[01:55:10.913 --> 01:55:13.074]  So why would somebody want an enemy?
[01:55:13.714 --> 01:55:16.515]  Well that would be if you wanted to scare
[01:55:21.061 --> 01:55:43.552]  We go back to Machiavelli, and Machiavelli wrote that if you're a leader of a country, if you're a dictator of a country, a ruler, a hard-handed ruler, and the people are getting fed up with you, and they don't like the high taxes, and they don't like the limitations on their liberty, and they're rising into a revolution or a revolt, Machiavelli said that you've got to engage in a war.
[01:55:47.298 --> 01:55:48.699]  Either a war or the threat of war.
[01:55:49.019 --> 01:56:09.328]  So they will be so frightened by the tyranny and the tragic destruction and death of war, that they will accept any kind of, you know, any kind of cruelty, any kind of high taxation, any kind of resistance, I mean, you know, resistance to their level of freedom and so forth, because they're filled with fear.
[01:56:09.728 --> 01:56:12.229]  So he said wars are what you should go into.
[01:56:12.630 --> 01:56:14.050]  So there's the trick.
[01:56:14.090 --> 01:56:15.531]  That's why you would want an enemy.
[01:56:16.011 --> 01:56:29.841]  You would want an enemy in order to bring your population under passive control so they will accept all of the absurdities and the upfronts on their liberty and their wealth and their privacy in the name of fighting the war.
[01:56:29.961 --> 01:56:42.910]  Well, now we find out that there were a lot of books and conferences held by people that we consider to be very, very, very, very wealthy, sponsored by them at least, think tanks and so forth, and one of them was
[01:56:43.951 --> 01:56:55.163]  Well, I won't go into too many details, but anyway, these books have been written and they talk about what else other than war can we use to frighten people into subservience.
[01:56:55.223 --> 01:57:00.169]  And so they talk about, well, we could use the fear of maybe environmental destruction.
[01:57:00.289 --> 01:57:04.694]  Maybe we could play that up and people would do anything to save the planet.
[01:57:05.214 --> 01:57:07.716]  Maybe we could have an act of terrorism.
[01:57:07.736 --> 01:57:12.158]  We could have somebody invade and blow up buildings and that would scare the dickens out of people.
[01:57:12.379 --> 01:57:16.461]  And they'd be willing to give up their freedoms in order to have security against terrorists.
[01:57:17.142 --> 01:57:21.364]  And of course in those days nobody was thinking about using a pandemic or anything like that.
[01:57:21.964 --> 01:57:30.650]  But if they had the technology in those days, by the way that book was called The Report from Iron Mountain, if they had the technology back in the days
[01:57:31.898 --> 01:57:32.919]  Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:57:57.553 --> 01:58:02.275]  Advantageous to buy an enemy, or finance an enemy, or create an enemy.
[01:58:02.295 --> 01:58:03.996]  So it's not really an enemy at all.
[01:58:04.156 --> 01:58:07.638]  They're a companion, you might say, in their plan.
[01:58:07.858 --> 01:58:17.663]  So we go back to communism, and we realize that communism for a long time, up through the Cold War, was the best enemy that money could buy, because during those days,
[01:58:18.603 --> 01:58:29.586]  Our leaders here in the United States were, and by the way I fell for this because remember I came into this in the 60s and from the 60s through the early 70s I was all worried about communism.
[01:58:29.626 --> 01:58:36.188]  Communism, look they're taking over this country and that country and look they're sending their agents into our own government and look they're doing this and look they're doing that.
[01:58:36.468 --> 01:58:44.570]  Nobody was much interested because they couldn't really see the effects of it on the surface yet but I could see what was being done, the tunneling that was being underground.
[01:58:44.790 --> 01:58:47.332]  The whole thing was being put into place.
[01:58:47.352 --> 01:59:09.968]  But the point is that I was so, and my friends were all so concerned about communism, communism, that we didn't notice that some of our anti-communist leaders here in the United States who were leading this whole anti-communist movement themselves did not object to the principles of communism and they were building what you might call communism here in the United States.
[01:59:10.268 --> 01:59:13.551]  They were building a totalitarian system in the United States
[01:59:14.011 --> 01:59:16.412]  Calling it Americanism, calling it patriotism.
[01:59:16.692 --> 01:59:19.413]  They were doing it in the name of fighting communism.
[01:59:19.694 --> 01:59:35.840]  And if it hadn't been for the threat of communism and the scaring of people with all that, well then they couldn't, wouldn't have been able to build the system that we now see here in America that is really not any different at all than communism or fascism or Nazism, the correct name for it.
[01:59:35.860 --> 01:59:41.383]  So they use an outside threat many times their financing to then create a police state control arm here.
[01:59:42.472 --> 01:59:42.913]  Exactly.
[01:59:42.973 --> 01:59:50.166]  Now once you understand that, and this has happened over and over and over again, then you have to look at today's world events and you say, are they doing that again?
[01:59:50.186 --> 01:59:54.615]  This is a profound question because if they are,
[01:59:55.327 --> 01:59:57.389]  And there's no reason to think that it wouldn't.
[01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:58.310]  It's a good trick.
[01:59:58.350 --> 01:59:58.950]  It always works.
[01:59:59.491 --> 02:00:11.761]  Then that means that the communists that we see on our streets today, all the people that are scaring us and making us indignant and making us filled with rage, why don't they do something about this?
[02:00:12.202 --> 02:00:13.963]  Which is naturally what we would think.
[02:00:14.764 --> 02:00:21.950]  We have to realize that if those same forces that I was talking about are still running the show here in America, we call that now the deep state,
[02:00:22.734 --> 02:00:30.860]  Then we find out that yes, yes, yes, the deep state wants that because it's the best enemy you can buy right now.
[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:34.002]  And so now suddenly the name George Soros pops up.
[02:00:34.042 --> 02:00:36.364]  Where does he get all of his money?
[02:00:37.225 --> 02:00:41.207]  Is he really this financial genius that makes all this money out of thin air?
[02:00:41.368 --> 02:00:43.189]  Turns out he's been getting it from the State Department.
[02:00:43.249 --> 02:00:44.330]  Tens of millions over the years.
[02:00:45.154 --> 02:00:46.495]  Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
[02:00:47.255 --> 02:00:48.055]  And elsewhere, too.
[02:00:48.455 --> 02:00:49.616]  Now you're looking deeper.
[02:00:49.936 --> 02:00:55.838]  See, finally we get off at this level of, look, those bad guys over there, and anybody that opposes the bad guys has got to be a good guy, right?
[02:00:56.499 --> 02:00:57.919]  I fell for that in the 60s.
[02:00:58.239 --> 02:00:59.460]  I'm not going to fall for it again.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:09.964]  Just because somebody is the apparent opponent of the bad guys, we have to look at that somebody just as deeply and to make sure that it's not controlled opposition.
[02:01:10.644 --> 02:01:11.605]  I agree with you.
[02:01:11.625 --> 02:01:14.588]  So when we come back, give us your honest assessment of Donald John Trump.
[02:01:14.608 --> 02:01:20.314]  I mean, I know he has real enemies, but is it just power structures fighting over who gets control over the ship of state?
[02:01:20.354 --> 02:01:24.158]  I don't think Trump himself is a bad guy, but clearly he's not stood up to the censorship.
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:27.402]  He stood up to China and he's done a lot of good things, but...
[02:01:28.715 --> 02:01:32.878]  He says, well, if I crack down on Antifa, it'll be an agi-prop, it'll make us look bad.
[02:01:32.918 --> 02:01:34.278]  Doesn't matter, it's your duty to do it.
[02:01:34.899 --> 02:01:36.540]  So it's a very, very dangerous precedent.
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:39.021]  We'll talk about it with G. Edward Griffin, who is kicking butt.
[02:01:39.502 --> 02:01:42.784]  As usual, redpilluniversity.org, redpillexpo.org.
[02:01:42.804 --> 02:01:44.465]  Is there other sites people should visit, G. Edward?
[02:01:46.126 --> 02:01:53.070]  Well, I think, yeah, redpillexpo.org is the big one right now because we're putting on the Red Pill Expo on October 10th and 11th.
[02:01:53.410 --> 02:01:55.911]  We'll talk about the Red Pill Expo when we come back.
[02:01:55.951 --> 02:01:56.532]  We'll be right back.
[02:01:57.841 --> 02:02:01.563]  Welcome back, I'm your host Alex Jones on this September 22nd transmission.
[02:02:06.045 --> 02:02:15.789]  We've got the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the Liberty Movement here with us, and I should have mentioned this, the redpillexpo.org, I'm glad you're putting an expo on, where is that G. Edward Griffin?
[02:02:16.150 --> 02:02:16.950]  How do people find it?
[02:02:16.970 --> 02:02:17.770]  How do people get involved?
[02:02:17.790 --> 02:02:18.231]  How do they go?
[02:02:19.311 --> 02:02:22.153]  Well, yeah, you're going to love where it is.
[02:02:22.233 --> 02:02:27.395]  It's on Jekyll Island, of course, anybody that knows where the Federal Reserve was
[02:02:29.718 --> 02:02:31.059]  No, it was Jekyll Island.
[02:02:31.079 --> 02:02:34.120]  That's the reason my book is called The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:35.341]  So that's where it is.
[02:02:35.381 --> 02:02:37.942]  We're going to hold it right there in the convention center.
[02:02:38.482 --> 02:02:40.043]  And we debated long and hard.
[02:02:40.243 --> 02:02:40.963]  Will people come?
[02:02:41.003 --> 02:02:42.004]  Will they be afraid?
[02:02:42.044 --> 02:02:45.906]  Will they want to hide in their basements and put their masks on?
[02:02:45.966 --> 02:02:47.907]  Anyway, we said nuts with that.
[02:02:47.927 --> 02:02:48.667]  We're tired of that.
[02:02:48.707 --> 02:02:49.747]  We're through with that.
[02:02:49.767 --> 02:02:51.028]  When is it again?
[02:02:52.049 --> 02:02:55.170]  It's October 10 and 11 coming right up in about two weeks.
[02:02:55.350 --> 02:02:56.291]  You think I should come?
[02:02:57.571 --> 02:02:57.871]  Pardon?
[02:02:58.252 --> 02:02:58.972]  You think I should come?
[02:03:00.370 --> 02:03:01.330]  Well, I think you should come.
[02:03:01.750 --> 02:03:04.091]  If you don't come, I'll be very, very upset.
[02:03:04.331 --> 02:03:05.131]  You want me to come speak?
[02:03:05.591 --> 02:03:06.571]  I heard about this just the other day.
[02:03:06.591 --> 02:03:07.951]  That's why I wanted to get you on a few weeks ago.
[02:03:07.971 --> 02:03:08.872]  You want me to come?
[02:03:08.992 --> 02:03:11.252]  Well, I didn't know that you were available, Alex.
[02:03:11.292 --> 02:03:12.112]  Let me check and see.
[02:03:12.392 --> 02:03:14.753]  We're loaded, but maybe we can move some time around.
[02:03:14.793 --> 02:03:15.793]  I think that would be wonderful.
[02:03:15.973 --> 02:03:17.513]  Well, I don't want to, I don't need to speak or anything.
[02:03:17.553 --> 02:03:20.754]  I just, you know, I don't want to cause a big stir there for no reason, though.
[02:03:21.134 --> 02:03:24.055]  But I'd love to be, because you wrote the book, The Creeks from Jekyll Island.
[02:03:24.415 --> 02:03:25.675]  Explain that to folks that don't know.
[02:03:26.914 --> 02:03:32.379]  Well, yeah, the creature from Jekyll Island is a second look, as I called it, at the Federal Reserve System.
[02:03:32.839 --> 02:03:40.386]  And as you already know, the Federal Reserve was created on Jekyll Island, which was off the coast of Georgia back in 1910.
[02:03:40.486 --> 02:03:48.313]  It was privately owned by these very bankers that we're talking about, the ones that created the Federal Reserve System.
[02:03:48.971 --> 02:03:58.939]  You know, agents of the Rockefellers and the Morgans, and they had connections over with the Rothschilds and the Warburgs overseas in Germany and England and France and so forth.
[02:03:59.179 --> 02:04:00.900]  International banking cartel, really.
[02:04:01.521 --> 02:04:03.983]  And so this is the story of how that came about.
[02:04:04.643 --> 02:04:09.367]  And I saw it not as a story about money and banking, but it was a story of a crime.
[02:04:09.387 --> 02:04:14.791]  One of the biggest crimes ever committed in history is the capture of the world through the monetary system.
[02:04:15.396 --> 02:04:19.179]  You know, people say, gee, should we nationalize the banks?
[02:04:19.599 --> 02:04:24.182]  Well, folks, I'm here to tell you that years ago, the banks privatized the governments.
[02:04:24.682 --> 02:04:28.365]  No, the government's not going to nationalize the banks because the banks already run the governments.
[02:04:28.705 --> 02:04:30.706]  And this is the story of how that came to be.
[02:04:31.267 --> 02:04:32.367]  So that's where we're going.
[02:04:32.808 --> 02:04:33.908]  And it's kind of symbolic.
[02:04:33.968 --> 02:04:42.374]  We're not going there to revere these guys, but to kind of wiggle our fingers and noses at them and say, we're back and we're going to take back our country and our world.
[02:04:42.814 --> 02:04:45.517]  So anyway, that's where it's going to be, and it's all about red pills.
[02:04:45.597 --> 02:04:46.758]  Red pills, red pills.
[02:04:47.038 --> 02:04:52.784]  Our lives are filled with illusions, and it seems like the most important aspects of our lives have the biggest illusions.
[02:04:53.145 --> 02:04:56.348]  So that's what it's all about, and I urge people to come to our website.
[02:04:56.408 --> 02:04:58.550]  It's redpillexpo.org.
[02:04:58.930 --> 02:05:01.253]  If you can't make it in person, which I hope you can.
[02:05:01.573 --> 02:05:03.014]  You too, Alex, especially you.
[02:05:04.616 --> 02:05:06.378]  If you can't make it, of course, it's a life's
[02:05:08.535 --> 02:05:09.055]  Available.
[02:05:09.395 --> 02:05:11.456]  So it's under preparation right now.
[02:05:11.496 --> 02:05:12.417]  The orders are coming in.
[02:05:12.917 --> 02:05:15.799]  I'm looking at the corner of my computer and bing, bing, bing, bing.
[02:05:15.819 --> 02:05:16.339]  They're coming in.
[02:05:16.379 --> 02:05:23.423]  So people are standing up and they want to come stand tall as human beings and let the world be and they're not going to wear any masks.
[02:05:23.503 --> 02:05:24.324]  I can assure you of that.
[02:05:24.604 --> 02:05:26.285]  And they're not going to accept any vaccines.
[02:05:26.485 --> 02:05:26.865]  Yeah, I know.
[02:05:26.965 --> 02:05:27.866]  I just like the idea.
[02:05:27.886 --> 02:05:29.247]  I don't do a lot of events myself.
[02:05:29.307 --> 02:05:30.007]  I just like the idea.
[02:05:30.027 --> 02:05:32.689]  I knew you were doing this, but here it's in Jekyll Island.
[02:05:33.069 --> 02:05:34.230]  Here it's going to the convention center.
[02:05:34.270 --> 02:05:35.831]  That is very, very exciting.
[02:05:36.191 --> 02:05:37.432]  So I definitely want to promote that.
[02:05:38.033 --> 02:05:40.074]  Everybody should go there.
[02:05:40.114 --> 02:05:41.335]  Does it run one day, two days?
[02:05:41.375 --> 02:05:42.616]  What's coming up with it?
[02:05:43.716 --> 02:05:44.377]  Well, it's two days.
[02:05:44.797 --> 02:05:45.297]  It's two days.
[02:05:46.747 --> 02:05:51.372]  The third day, the Monday that follows it, is kind of a drifting day.
[02:05:51.392 --> 02:05:54.535]  A lot of people are staying over because they want to do some sightseeing.
[02:05:54.755 --> 02:05:56.477]  Jekyll Island is quite an interesting place.
[02:05:56.877 --> 02:06:01.582]  And it's also a hangout day for those of us that like to meet new people and form coalitions.
[02:06:04.483 --> 02:06:08.125]  Well, everybody should go in defiance of COVID, but to meet Gerard Griffin as well.
[02:06:08.185 --> 02:06:09.365]  So, I knew that was going on.
[02:06:09.385 --> 02:06:10.266]  I'd forgotten it was happening.
[02:06:10.646 --> 02:06:13.387]  I'm glad that I asked you about the website, because you're such a gentleman.
[02:06:13.407 --> 02:06:16.008]  You would have never even plugged that this event is coming up.
[02:06:16.068 --> 02:06:18.089]  RedpillExpo.org.
[02:06:18.269 --> 02:06:19.950]  Okay, let's start getting back into it now.
[02:06:20.370 --> 02:06:21.730]  We've only got 15 minutes to the next hour.
[02:06:21.750 --> 02:06:24.071]  Okay, 15 minutes.
[02:06:24.192 --> 02:06:26.633]  Well, we should have 15 days to talk about this.
[02:06:26.753 --> 02:06:28.113]  Well, 15 minutes to the next hour.
[02:06:28.133 --> 02:06:29.594]  So, we've got about 20-something minutes, but go ahead.
[02:06:30.570 --> 02:06:32.193]  Okay, well that helped a little bit.
[02:06:32.653 --> 02:06:40.045]  I guess where we were going with that is the fact that controlled opposition is one of the classic strategies of our opponents.
[02:06:40.820 --> 02:06:48.667]  And once we get a handle on it, we realize that it's not just the left versus the right, because actually there's very little difference of view.
[02:06:49.327 --> 02:06:53.111]  I mean, the extreme left and the extreme right are the same, frankly.
[02:06:53.151 --> 02:06:55.312]  What's the difference between communism and Nazism?
[02:06:55.373 --> 02:07:00.397]  There's no difference, except one has a hammer and sickle on the flag, and the other one has a swastika.
[02:07:01.037 --> 02:07:09.404]  Once you get past that, and the language that they speak maybe, but you read their books and their theories, their ideology, they all believe the same thing.
[02:07:09.765 --> 02:07:15.409]  And they fight with each other like dickens, mainly not over what they believe, but because they want to see who's going to be boss.
[02:07:15.769 --> 02:07:19.052]  They're fighting for dominance in this world system that they want to create.
[02:07:19.292 --> 02:07:25.958]  So once you understand that and internalize on it, then you look at, now you can turn on your TV sets and say, what's going on here?
[02:07:26.258 --> 02:07:30.280]  Well, we see all these horrible things on the street, and everybody hates them.
[02:07:30.320 --> 02:07:30.900]  And look, they're good.
[02:07:31.060 --> 02:07:32.220]  Oh my gosh, we can't have that.
[02:07:32.561 --> 02:07:34.621]  Anybody would be better than these people, right?
[02:07:35.562 --> 02:07:36.082]  Wrong!
[02:07:36.102 --> 02:07:37.583]  It could be the same.
[02:07:38.203 --> 02:07:43.585]  You can't just judge a person on the basis of who they don't like or who they speak against.
[02:07:43.965 --> 02:07:50.228]  You've got to understand what their principles are, what they believe in, and what have they done, and what will they do.
[02:07:50.528 --> 02:07:52.629]  It's just not who they hate, but who are they?
[02:07:53.229 --> 02:08:01.217]  So this is an important lesson, and I'm afraid I see Americans getting so upset with what is happening on the so-called left.
[02:08:01.678 --> 02:08:02.739]  It's not really the left.
[02:08:03.019 --> 02:08:04.441]  These people are professionals.
[02:08:04.901 --> 02:08:07.043]  They're not out there because of what they believe in.
[02:08:07.384 --> 02:08:10.167]  They're out there because they're receiving a paycheck from Mr. Soros.
[02:08:10.507 --> 02:08:15.652]  Now, if the White House or anybody else wants to do something about this, what the heck are they doing about Mr. Soros?
[02:08:17.012 --> 02:08:17.452]  Nothing!
[02:08:17.972 --> 02:08:19.673]  And that's the clue right there, you see.
[02:08:20.033 --> 02:08:22.654]  They could stop this immediately if they really wanted to.
[02:08:22.915 --> 02:08:24.735]  But no, the orders are, stand down.
[02:08:25.155 --> 02:08:25.696]  Stand down.
[02:08:25.716 --> 02:08:26.696]  The police don't go out.
[02:08:26.716 --> 02:08:27.216]  They don't interfere.
[02:08:27.396 --> 02:08:28.337]  They want the violence.
[02:08:28.357 --> 02:08:30.458]  They want the destruction.
[02:08:30.838 --> 02:08:32.298]  They want blood in the streets.
[02:08:32.358 --> 02:08:33.139]  They want hatred.
[02:08:33.459 --> 02:08:33.699]  Why?
[02:08:34.039 --> 02:08:39.081]  Because then people will say, please, Mr. President, give us martial law.
[02:08:39.401 --> 02:08:40.462]  And that's the endgame.
[02:08:41.272 --> 02:08:42.113]  It's so clear.
[02:08:42.413 --> 02:08:43.694]  It's so clear, so we have to be careful.
[02:08:43.714 --> 02:08:44.835]  No, I totally agree, but let's pull back.
[02:08:44.915 --> 02:08:46.996]  There clearly is a good versus evil angle.
[02:08:47.456 --> 02:08:54.101]  And if you look at what the left funds, they want pedophilia, they want destruction of the family, they want to dumb people down, they want to poison people.
[02:08:54.641 --> 02:08:55.982]  A, is that accurate from your research?
[02:08:56.042 --> 02:08:56.503]  And why?
[02:08:56.703 --> 02:08:59.645]  It really seems there's a real Satanism underbelly to this.
[02:09:00.526 --> 02:09:00.906]  There is.
[02:09:00.946 --> 02:09:01.967]  There's no question about it.
[02:09:01.987 --> 02:09:03.668]  I mean, there's no defense.
[02:09:04.208 --> 02:09:08.111]  My men, take a good read of Mein Kampf.
[02:09:08.792 --> 02:09:09.893]  Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf.
[02:09:10.133 --> 02:09:11.195]  He also was a Satanist.
[02:09:11.215 --> 02:09:12.316]  He also was an occultist.
[02:09:12.336 --> 02:09:14.057]  He also wanted to destroy the family.
[02:09:14.418 --> 02:09:18.262]  All the things that we don't like about communism is in the extreme right.
[02:09:18.302 --> 02:09:21.365]  The Nazis, the Nazis and the fascists believe the same thing.
[02:09:21.405 --> 02:09:22.206]  That's my point.
[02:09:22.526 --> 02:09:25.088]  We get so focused at one group, we forget that, hey,
[02:09:26.009 --> 02:09:27.350]  Evil is universal.
[02:09:27.490 --> 02:09:28.811]  It's not just in one group.
[02:09:29.312 --> 02:09:35.096]  Any of these violent groups and ideologically collectivist groups have the same belief system.
[02:09:35.576 --> 02:09:36.977]  So we have to look deeper than that.
[02:09:37.017 --> 02:09:37.797]  That's my only point.
[02:09:37.837 --> 02:09:38.678]  Yes, I agree with you.
[02:09:38.698 --> 02:09:39.118]  That's right.
[02:09:39.158 --> 02:09:42.641]  Anything that has authoritarian power can be hijacked and used for evil.
[02:09:43.650 --> 02:09:44.891]  Exactly, and will be.
[02:09:46.111 --> 02:09:47.191]  It always will be.
[02:09:47.672 --> 02:09:49.472]  So that's my message here.
[02:09:49.532 --> 02:09:54.875]  And so when we come to the big hard questions, well, what do we do about that today?
[02:09:55.315 --> 02:09:56.515]  Do we have any friends?
[02:09:57.236 --> 02:09:58.376]  And it's a good question.
[02:09:59.236 --> 02:10:00.597]  I know how to ask the questions.
[02:10:00.957 --> 02:10:02.438]  I don't always know how to answer them.
[02:10:02.918 --> 02:10:05.579]  I don't know what we can do about it, except be clear.
[02:10:06.613 --> 02:10:11.534]  In our own minds, what we believe in, and not just follow the leader, that's the only thing.
[02:10:11.554 --> 02:10:17.475]  No, I agree that Trump's saying, hey, we got a vaccine, Trump does things I don't like, but he's also getting peace deals.
[02:10:17.855 --> 02:10:20.856]  I know they legitimately don't like him, but I'm also not naive.
[02:10:21.296 --> 02:10:28.337]  I don't think Trump himself is a deceiver, but obviously there are powerful forces, like CNN first thought he'd be a good candidate for Hillary to beat.
[02:10:28.917 --> 02:10:31.458]  So there's a lot of weird designs out there.
[02:10:32.369 --> 02:10:33.490]  Yeah, you got it.
[02:10:33.790 --> 02:10:35.571]  I couldn't agree with you more, Alex.
[02:10:36.232 --> 02:10:50.661]  And everybody, especially politicians that have been around for a while, I would imagine that most of these big, well-known figures have something in their past that could be held over them to keep them in line.
[02:10:51.101 --> 02:10:53.603]  That's what Epstein was all about, right?
[02:10:54.569 --> 02:10:58.312]  That was Epstein's job was to compromise leaders.
[02:10:59.073 --> 02:11:02.015]  And we know that Mr. Trump and Mr. Epstein were very close.
[02:11:02.555 --> 02:11:07.139]  So is it possible that there's something there that they're holding over Mr. Trump to keep him in line?
[02:11:07.239 --> 02:11:07.739]  I don't know.
[02:11:08.120 --> 02:11:09.341]  I'm just asking the questions.
[02:11:09.701 --> 02:11:13.404]  I do know that this is the kind of thing that goes on all the time.
[02:11:14.025 --> 02:11:25.772]  So I wouldn't take it off the list, I wouldn't take it off the table, but it might be part of the explanation of why Mr. Trump is unable to do all of the things, actually do all of the things that he says he wants to do.
[02:11:26.172 --> 02:11:27.573]  Maybe he's not free to act.
[02:11:27.593 --> 02:11:29.934]  But we certainly know the Clintons were on the airplanes.
[02:11:29.994 --> 02:11:30.914]  They are compromised.
[02:11:32.295 --> 02:11:33.516]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[02:11:33.576 --> 02:11:37.198]  I mean, if you look at the list, I mean, when you get to the royalty of England,
[02:11:37.819 --> 02:11:38.860]  Prince Charles and so forth.
[02:11:38.880 --> 02:11:40.382]  I mean, is there anything left?
[02:11:40.402 --> 02:11:43.787]  I mean, the only thing we have to find now is just a photograph of the Queen.
[02:11:43.847 --> 02:11:44.548]  That would be something.
[02:11:44.968 --> 02:11:45.389]  Exactly.
[02:11:45.409 --> 02:11:47.632]  We've gone all the way up the little monkey pole here.
[02:11:50.717 --> 02:11:52.478]  That's a great, great, great way to say it.
[02:11:52.498 --> 02:11:55.060]  Jim McGriffin's our guest, redpilluniversity.org.
[02:11:55.080 --> 02:11:56.901]  We're going to break into two more segments with him.
[02:11:57.101 --> 02:11:58.402]  I want to invite him back up next week.
[02:11:58.782 --> 02:11:59.923]  I'm not trying to crash events.
[02:11:59.983 --> 02:12:03.365]  He invited me years ago, like 10 years ago, to an event at Jekyll Island.
[02:12:03.385 --> 02:12:07.388]  I couldn't go, but this COVID thing's got me spoiling to travel because we're not supposed to.
[02:12:07.408 --> 02:12:07.708]  Who knows?
[02:12:07.768 --> 02:12:08.689]  I might show up at that.
[02:12:09.665 --> 02:12:13.589]  Uh, but I don't really care about speaking, but, uh, I might just fly out there and meet G. Edward Griffin.
[02:12:14.089 --> 02:12:18.453]  But seriously, don't forget, folks, we have the high-quality, storable food right now that everybody should order.
[02:12:19.034 --> 02:12:20.875]  We've got a week to two weeks for delivery.
[02:12:20.895 --> 02:12:21.796]  We've got it in stock.
[02:12:21.816 --> 02:12:22.637]  Everybody else doesn't.
[02:12:22.937 --> 02:12:23.598]  They'll lie to you.
[02:12:24.118 --> 02:12:28.542]  And it's, uh, a key website we've got up on InfoWarsStore.com that you can find right now.
[02:12:28.602 --> 02:12:29.703]  PrepareWithAlex.com.
[02:12:30.864 --> 02:12:32.626]  Well, G. Edward Griffin does, so he's here.
[02:12:32.666 --> 02:12:34.327]  He knows about history and science books.
[02:12:34.888 --> 02:12:35.468]  And so do I!
[02:12:36.522 --> 02:12:39.505]  And the globalists want to make you think science and history is some elitist thing.
[02:12:40.086 --> 02:12:45.912]  Once you get science and history, then you start tying it to everything else, then you put it into function, and then you're more successful.
[02:12:45.932 --> 02:12:50.878]  The most valuable thing is knowing how history operates, so you're not doomed to repeat it.
[02:12:50.898 --> 02:12:54.582]  G. Edward Griffin, short segment now, long segment coming up.
[02:12:55.142 --> 02:12:58.466]  What else do you want to impart to the viewers and listeners about where we are on this planet right now?
[02:13:02.062 --> 02:13:04.444]  Wow, that's another great profound question.
[02:13:04.464 --> 02:13:06.206]  Where are we on this planet right now?
[02:13:06.927 --> 02:13:13.072]  I think, I haven't given this any thought, but I think we're at a spot that I'm glad I'm here.
[02:13:13.192 --> 02:13:19.238]  I can't think of any time in previous history that has been more important where changes
[02:13:20.896 --> 02:13:29.678]  Efforts and conflicts being resolved are going to make a bigger difference in the future of mankind than right now in this era and in this decade in which we live.
[02:13:30.098 --> 02:13:30.738]  It's scary.
[02:13:30.758 --> 02:13:32.638]  There are a lot of things that could go wrong.
[02:13:33.038 --> 02:13:34.778]  Probably a lot of things that will go wrong.
[02:13:35.278 --> 02:13:41.419]  But we have an opportunity here to make a difference in the long view of history and for the future development of mankind.
[02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:43.600]  We're coming up to a crossroads, as you know, Alex.
[02:13:44.000 --> 02:13:50.021]  I mean, they're trying to convert humans into robots or transhumans, where they're half robot and half
[02:13:50.601 --> 02:13:51.662]  I think so.
[02:14:13.524 --> 02:14:15.285]  We're pretty much like we are today.
[02:14:15.545 --> 02:14:23.930]  But then we'll have this hybrid that they're working to develop, the transhumans, and there'll be all the slaves and the little robots that will do exactly what they're told.
[02:14:24.610 --> 02:14:31.774]  And then the elite can live even without any fear of revolution or revolt on the part of the masses.
[02:14:32.314 --> 02:14:34.175]  And yeah, look at this.
[02:14:34.376 --> 02:14:36.677]  This is exactly what they want to see.
[02:14:37.344 --> 02:14:39.265]  So, we have to stop that.
[02:14:39.645 --> 02:14:45.907]  I think it's our responsibility and our opportunity to put an end to that and to put in place the reasons for it.
[02:14:46.167 --> 02:14:48.048]  People get so issue-oriented.
[02:14:48.828 --> 02:14:49.929]  Let me throw a reason out.
[02:14:50.149 --> 02:14:53.690]  I'm all for technology, except it always has a Trojan horse built into it.
[02:14:54.030 --> 02:14:55.911]  It always is dehumanizing me.
[02:14:56.291 --> 02:15:02.433]  I'd love if there was some, you know, beneficent group up there that was doing it, but no, they always give us stuff at a detriment.
[02:15:02.473 --> 02:15:04.054]  They never give us something that empowers us.
[02:15:05.421 --> 02:15:05.981]  Well, of course.
[02:15:06.202 --> 02:15:10.344]  You know, that's part of human nature, too, because if they see... It's kind of like a dog.
[02:15:10.384 --> 02:15:16.148]  I mean, I hate to say this, and I'm probably going to get a lot of criticism for it, but I think that, you know, everybody has a dog.
[02:15:16.168 --> 02:15:17.789]  You know, the dogs are untrustworthy.
[02:15:17.849 --> 02:15:25.114]  No matter how loyal they are, if they're not looking, and you put a piece of meat out on the floor, and you say, no, no, dog, don't eat that meat.
[02:15:25.154 --> 02:15:26.114]  It'll sit there and won't eat it.
[02:15:26.335 --> 02:15:31.218]  But you go out that door, and if you're gone more than 10 minutes, you come back, that meat is gone.
[02:15:31.718 --> 02:15:33.659]  That's a great allegory of big tech.
[02:15:33.679 --> 02:15:39.901]  They've been caught lying, abusing their trust, and now they're completely arrogant, and Congress doesn't know what's going on.
[02:15:39.921 --> 02:15:41.321]  They've just run away with the future.
[02:15:42.321 --> 02:15:42.521]  Yeah.
[02:15:43.082 --> 02:15:44.442]  So, people are like that.
[02:15:44.782 --> 02:15:50.464]  You leave them alone, you put something very tempting in front of them that they really want, really want.
[02:15:50.824 --> 02:15:53.665]  Sooner or later, as long as you allow that temptation to exist,
[02:15:54.381 --> 02:15:56.943]  Sooner or later, most of them are going to give in to the temptation.
[02:15:56.963 --> 02:15:59.505]  Let's say your buddy's got a super hot wife and she's promiscuous.
[02:15:59.865 --> 02:16:04.269]  Maybe the first three or four times, but he just leaves for a month and says, hey, baby, stay at his house.
[02:16:04.289 --> 02:16:06.271]  You're going to probably end up with a sack pretty quick.
[02:16:09.273 --> 02:16:12.616]  Well, I guess that fits in the category of what I'm talking about.
[02:16:12.776 --> 02:16:14.137]  What's that meat on the table, buddy?
[02:16:15.100 --> 02:16:17.521]  Humans can't be trusted, and we have to know that.
[02:16:17.801 --> 02:16:22.203]  So when we build political systems and social systems... We've got to put checks in to control it.
[02:16:22.403 --> 02:16:28.786]  You've got to put checks in it and make everything transparent so it makes it easier for the human to do what he knows is right.
[02:16:28.806 --> 02:16:30.787]  To reward goodness, not badness.
[02:16:31.943 --> 02:16:33.364]  Yes, exactly.
[02:16:33.765 --> 02:16:42.813]  So back to the question, this is a time in history where we have a chance to bring all of these hidden elements, these ideas to the surface.
[02:16:42.853 --> 02:16:46.617]  It's not just about whether we should do this or should do that, but we have to talk about
[02:16:46.997 --> 02:16:47.377]  Why?
[02:16:47.477 --> 02:16:48.098]  Big picture.
[02:16:48.118 --> 02:16:51.961]  Don't talk about what's happening right now and just the pieces, but the big picture.
[02:16:52.001 --> 02:17:04.130]  Let's talk about that with G. Edward Griffin about the why of the universe and the big picture and how to get that 35,000 foot view so you see the different players and not just being one of the players, but understanding the whole game.
[02:17:04.170 --> 02:17:07.713]  How do you transcend the game and not play the game to stop the game?
[02:17:07.733 --> 02:17:08.994]  We'll be right back with G. Edward Griffin.
[02:17:09.374 --> 02:17:09.894]  Stay with us.
[02:17:09.914 --> 02:17:10.955]  He has the new website.
[02:17:10.975 --> 02:17:11.696]  We'll tell you about it in a moment.
[02:17:12.372 --> 02:17:15.053]  Are you sick and tired of your calm, peaceful life?
[02:17:15.734 --> 02:17:17.254]  Are you sleeping too well at night?
[02:17:17.714 --> 02:17:20.616]  Is your city too safe?
[02:17:21.456 --> 02:17:22.457]  Well, not anymore!
[02:17:23.197 --> 02:17:25.078]  Introducing Democrats!
[02:17:25.598 --> 02:17:33.782]  Politicians so incompetent, they'll fill your neighborhood with riots, looting, rampant violence, and even homelessness!
[02:17:34.542 --> 02:17:38.684]  The secret is a special blend of corruption and good old-fashioned stupidity!
[02:17:39.562 --> 02:17:41.584]  No more pesky law and order.
[02:17:41.944 --> 02:17:45.627]  When Democrats are in charge, nobody's safe.
[02:17:45.687 --> 02:17:50.250]  Simply vote for Democrats, sit back, and watch your neighborhood burn to the ground.
[02:17:51.031 --> 02:17:51.551]  But wait!
[02:17:51.972 --> 02:18:00.158]  Vote for Democrats now, and they'll include rolling blackouts, election fraud, cancel culture, taxes, and more taxes.
[02:18:00.818 --> 02:18:01.419]  Democrats.
[02:18:01.699 --> 02:18:03.881]  Bringing chaos right to your front door.
[02:18:05.345 --> 02:18:10.647]  All right, Hubert Griffin is our guest, and he was talking during the break, he would like me to come out to his Red Pill Expo.
[02:18:10.707 --> 02:18:15.129]  I just called my wife during the break, and that is the 11th and 12th in Jekyll Island, Georgia.
[02:18:15.149 --> 02:18:18.550]  We're tentatively going to go, but regardless, you should go because it'll sell out quick.
[02:18:19.131 --> 02:18:21.852]  You have the website redpillexpo.org.
[02:18:21.872 --> 02:18:25.353]  We didn't intend to really plug this today, but it just came up, and so here we are.
[02:18:25.373 --> 02:18:28.535]  I wanted to go to some of the other events he's had at Jekyll Island and was never able to.
[02:18:28.555 --> 02:18:34.257]  But getting back to the final segment we have, we really appreciate you joining us, and obviously you've got to come on again before the Expo regardless.
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:42.243]  I know we can get into the dialectic and how the globalists try to control both sides, but I know I'm not controlled.
[02:18:42.743 --> 02:18:49.586]  I know they legitimately have tried to buy me off, tried to shut me up, and I know that they're not omnipresent.
[02:18:50.467 --> 02:18:51.808]  I agree we've got to watch out about a
[02:18:52.785 --> 02:18:58.088]  Amassing authoritarian power in the name of countering them because that ends up destroying us and that any power will be abused.
[02:18:58.108 --> 02:18:59.389]  That's why you don't want to amass it.
[02:18:59.409 --> 02:19:04.912]  But overall, just gut level and every other perspective, I think Trump means well.
[02:19:05.552 --> 02:19:07.113]  He hasn't gotten some of what he wants done.
[02:19:07.133 --> 02:19:12.856]  I'm concerned about him saying, oh, we've got a better vaccine, but then Gates gets mad about it and doesn't want that because he wants to control it.
[02:19:13.696 --> 02:19:14.376]  What is your view?
[02:19:14.416 --> 02:19:15.737]  Your real honest view.
[02:19:15.777 --> 02:19:16.517]  We won't hurt our feelings.
[02:19:16.557 --> 02:19:17.098]  We respect you.
[02:19:17.498 --> 02:19:19.959]  As long before Donald Trump came along, you were fighting the tyrants.
[02:19:20.419 --> 02:19:22.920]  Long before Q came along, you know, you were there.
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:25.281]  What do you think of Donald Trump?
[02:19:27.542 --> 02:19:35.525]  Well, yeah, I almost wish you hadn't asked me that question because I have a bad habit of once I'm asked that question, I have to answer it.
[02:19:36.245 --> 02:19:38.226]  But before I do it... But we're not censored.
[02:19:38.246 --> 02:19:39.507]  We're not the Donald Trump cult, brother.
[02:19:39.527 --> 02:19:39.867]  We respect you.
[02:19:40.939 --> 02:19:42.801]  I know, and I understand all of that.
[02:19:43.021 --> 02:19:47.046]  Let me emphasize, though, that a moment ago you said our event was the 11th and 12th.
[02:19:47.066 --> 02:19:49.568]  It's actually the 10th and the 11th, so let me get rid of that.
[02:19:49.809 --> 02:19:51.370]  Teleprompter-free, yeah, don't worry.
[02:19:54.244 --> 02:19:58.988]  I think Mr. Trump is a politician, and that is neither good nor bad.
[02:19:59.008 --> 02:20:01.669]  I mean, we have politicians.
[02:20:02.130 --> 02:20:16.000]  But once we understand a man, I don't care whether it's Mr. Trump, or whether it was Barry Goldwater, or I don't care if it was George Washington or Thomas Jefferson, once they are in politics in the modern world, the way that our governments and systems are set up,
[02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:17.981]  Giant, complex bureaucracies.
[02:20:46.340 --> 02:20:47.421]  We're good to go.
[02:21:04.716 --> 02:21:23.527]  I was about to say, the New York Times, BuzzFeed, all of them literally had, the last four years, dozens of private detective groups, and there was nothing there, because I just, I go to work, whatever, you know, I drink too much sometimes, that's about it, and they literally just think, like, this guy just works all the time, there's nothing there, and they can't even get people to lie about me for money, so I've been blessed.
[02:21:24.748 --> 02:21:26.749]  Yeah, well, I think, you know,
[02:21:29.433 --> 02:21:43.651]  If this cabal, let's call it that now for a moment, if they can assassinate the president in front of the whole world, they can certainly get rid of any president or any secondary figure with no problem, even with means that are not so obvious as assassination.
[02:21:44.275 --> 02:21:49.277]  There are ways of making people very, very sick, and you have no idea where that electromagnetic... I totally agree.
[02:21:49.297 --> 02:21:50.098]  So let me ask you this.
[02:21:50.558 --> 02:21:56.480]  The COVID thing is obviously a world government, UN power grab to put a mask over our face to make us take shots.
[02:21:56.921 --> 02:21:59.282]  This was always their big medical charity gamble.
[02:21:59.302 --> 02:22:02.403]  I mean, they were always building... Is this their power grab?
[02:22:02.783 --> 02:22:08.506]  Did the global awakening precipitate this to come early, or were they already planning this right on time?
[02:22:09.986 --> 02:22:11.127]  Well, I don't know about that one.
[02:22:12.239 --> 02:22:16.102]  I think it's been in the works much longer than I was aware of it.
[02:22:16.942 --> 02:22:19.384]  This is where, you know, I have so much to learn.
[02:22:20.144 --> 02:22:27.909]  The idea of technocracy didn't really sink into my consciousness until about, oh, I'm going to guess about five or six years ago.
[02:22:28.510 --> 02:22:30.671]  But our opponents had the idea of
[02:22:31.374 --> 02:22:35.175]  Turning our systems into administrative governments instead of elective governments.
[02:22:35.556 --> 02:22:37.396]  Administration by people.
[02:22:37.436 --> 02:22:38.437]  They don't even know who they are.
[02:22:38.497 --> 02:22:39.237]  It's an administration.
[02:22:39.257 --> 02:22:39.917]  It's a bureaucracy.
[02:22:40.217 --> 02:22:41.498]  Now, it's a computer.
[02:22:41.518 --> 02:22:42.218]  It's a machine.
[02:22:42.598 --> 02:22:43.899]  It's science, you know.
[02:22:44.179 --> 02:22:49.821]  It's the things beyond human control that makes it even harder to oppose in the mind of man.
[02:22:49.841 --> 02:22:52.682]  There's a false environment they're building.
[02:22:52.722 --> 02:22:53.162]  Absolutely.
[02:22:54.110 --> 02:22:58.553]  Yeah, so I don't know about whether they're on time or not, but they're very flexible.
[02:22:58.593 --> 02:23:02.175]  They'll do whatever, they'll postpone as long as they don't, they'll never give up.
[02:23:02.595 --> 02:23:03.656]  What is their endgame?
[02:23:03.876 --> 02:23:09.159]  If they have total power, could accelerate their plan 30 years in the future, what is it they really want?
[02:23:11.260 --> 02:23:12.401]  Well, they just want total power.
[02:23:12.441 --> 02:23:13.141]  What does that mean?
[02:23:14.823 --> 02:23:19.765]  I think the best way to envision it, in my mind at least, anybody that's in the military,
[02:23:23.166 --> 02:23:24.567]  You no longer have freedom.
[02:23:25.428 --> 02:23:26.188]  You're taken care of.
[02:23:26.208 --> 02:23:29.530]  You don't have to worry about your food, your shelter, your health care or anything like that.
[02:23:30.431 --> 02:23:34.154]  You're given housing and clothing and psychological counseling.
[02:23:34.254 --> 02:23:34.894]  Anything you want.
[02:23:35.154 --> 02:23:35.735]  Entertainment.
[02:23:35.795 --> 02:23:36.956]  It's all taken care of for you.
[02:23:37.536 --> 02:23:39.097]  All you have to do is follow orders.
[02:23:39.978 --> 02:23:49.044]  And as long as you follow orders and without asking questions or objecting or showing any resistance at all, you will move up to the top.
[02:23:49.685 --> 02:23:54.787]  You will probably be a high-ranking officer and possibly even a general.
[02:23:55.828 --> 02:23:58.769]  But the minute you start asking questions, well, now you're a troublemaker.
[02:23:58.809 --> 02:24:04.011]  And if you resist too much, you'll be demoted, you'll be given jobs, assignments that you don't like.
[02:24:04.391 --> 02:24:08.693]  And if you really are a bad boy or girl and resist orders, you'll get shot.
[02:24:09.543 --> 02:24:16.069]  This is how I think the world will look if these people have a chance to achieve their goals.
[02:24:16.469 --> 02:24:17.750]  It will be a military structure.
[02:24:17.790 --> 02:24:20.692]  There will be no need for money because you're in the military.
[02:24:20.712 --> 02:24:24.235]  You've got your food, you've got your clothing, you've got a nice house if you're an officer.
[02:24:24.636 --> 02:24:28.639]  If you're a high NCO, if you're a sergeant, you've got a nice house too.
[02:24:29.039 --> 02:24:31.822]  If you're private or something, you're probably living in the barracks.
[02:24:32.162 --> 02:24:33.984]  But you've got to put brain chips in your children.
[02:24:34.004 --> 02:24:35.325]  You've got to cut your son's testicles off.
[02:24:35.365 --> 02:24:36.826]  You've got to do exactly what you're told.
[02:24:37.207 --> 02:24:43.072]  And as long as you do what you're told, and you obey orders, and you don't question... And for the family, we all agree and talk to the 8-year-old.
[02:24:43.092 --> 02:24:44.413]  He agrees, have his balls chopped off.
[02:24:44.834 --> 02:24:46.395]  It's the end of humanity.
[02:24:46.595 --> 02:24:50.379]  They're going to get us in the straitjacket, and then make us give our humanity up, because that's what this is.
[02:24:51.420 --> 02:24:51.600]  Yep.
[02:24:51.900 --> 02:24:52.200]  That's it.
[02:24:52.961 --> 02:24:53.682]  It's as simple as that.
[02:24:55.148 --> 02:24:57.609]  The total power is destroying the human system forever.
[02:24:57.649 --> 02:25:00.111]  It's making us bow and give up our natural order.
[02:25:00.511 --> 02:25:01.752]  That's the final revolution.
[02:25:01.792 --> 02:25:03.753]  It's not even allowing normal human systems.
[02:25:03.973 --> 02:25:05.654]  That's how you win the war against humanity.
[02:25:08.356 --> 02:25:13.359]  And the funny thing about that, or the ironic thing, is that it'll still be controlled by real, genuine humans.
[02:25:13.859 --> 02:25:15.340]  People just like you and me.
[02:25:16.539 --> 02:25:18.180]  But they will be the elites.
[02:25:18.580 --> 02:25:24.443]  They'll be the ones that have the ability to direct the activities of all of the subhuman characters that they have created.
[02:25:24.683 --> 02:25:32.607]  The transhuman creatures that will outnumber them by far, but they will be totally subservient because they can be turned off by simply throwing the switch.
[02:25:34.491 --> 02:25:44.199]  It's that image of five years ago Zuckerberg with thousands of his employees in VR goggles hunched over and he's walking bipedally and they're like subhumans in his false reality.
[02:25:44.439 --> 02:25:45.360]  You're absolutely right.
[02:25:45.440 --> 02:25:46.361]  That's what this is.
[02:25:46.701 --> 02:25:47.922]  They retain their humanity.
[02:25:47.962 --> 02:25:48.763]  We give ours up.
[02:25:49.043 --> 02:25:49.784]  That's their religion.
[02:25:51.205 --> 02:25:51.605]  That's it.
[02:25:55.228 --> 02:25:57.390]  Jim Griffin's very powerful interview.
[02:25:57.410 --> 02:25:57.610]  30 seconds.
[02:25:57.670 --> 02:25:58.531]  Go ahead and finish up.
[02:26:00.839 --> 02:26:03.702]  Well, my final conclusion is that I hope I'm wrong.
[02:26:03.722 --> 02:26:04.804]  I think I'm not.
[02:26:05.505 --> 02:26:09.369]  And it's bad news, but the good news is that it doesn't have to go that way.
[02:26:09.689 --> 02:26:18.320]  There's still time and we have strength in numbers, but we have to stand up like human beings while we can and quit following these insane orders to
[02:26:19.040 --> 02:26:26.162]  Obey and open up our sleeves and let them inject stuff into our brains and into our veins.
[02:26:26.382 --> 02:26:27.922]  Oh, but we become immortal!
[02:26:28.142 --> 02:26:30.783]  No, everything the communist Satanists offer is a lie.
[02:26:31.123 --> 02:26:33.584]  G. Edward Griffin, redpillexpo.org.
[02:26:33.624 --> 02:26:37.425]  I give it a 90% chance, I'll let you know in the next few days, that I'm going to be there at your event, okay?
[02:26:38.407 --> 02:26:38.667]  All right.
[02:26:39.008 --> 02:26:39.789]  I'm going to announce it.
[02:26:39.809 --> 02:26:39.789]  90%.
[02:26:39.909 --> 02:26:42.472]  I'll let you know the next day or two.
[02:26:42.692 --> 02:26:43.353]  I'm probably going to come.
[02:26:43.373 --> 02:26:45.136]  I just got to make sure I can get out there and get a plane.
[02:26:45.156 --> 02:26:45.796]  That's wonderful.
[02:26:45.836 --> 02:26:46.698]  That's wonderful, Alex.
[02:26:47.298 --> 02:26:50.242]  I would have gotten to invite you earlier, but I didn't know how to reach you.
[02:26:50.582 --> 02:26:51.223]  We love you, brother.
[02:26:51.243 --> 02:26:52.425]  I'm going to say bye to you during the break.
[02:26:53.982 --> 02:26:57.225]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[02:26:57.245 --> 02:26:58.405]  They're going to contest the election.
[02:26:58.426 --> 02:26:59.967]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[02:27:00.167 --> 02:27:01.528]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[02:27:01.648 --> 02:27:02.669]  I want them shut down.
[02:27:02.729 --> 02:27:03.650]  I want them silenced.
[02:27:03.690 --> 02:27:04.490]  I want them muted.
[02:27:04.530 --> 02:27:06.312]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:27:06.352 --> 02:27:07.272]  You kept us on air.
[02:27:07.392 --> 02:27:08.713]  We did the analysis first.
[02:27:08.974 --> 02:27:09.994]  It's now gone mainstream.
[02:27:10.034 --> 02:27:11.836]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[02:27:12.116 --> 02:27:18.001]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[02:27:18.581 --> 02:27:19.662]  You need to stop right now.
[02:27:19.762 --> 02:27:20.843]  And they're very, very serious.
[02:27:20.964 --> 02:27:23.326]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[02:27:23.446 --> 02:27:24.267]  It's not gonna happen.
[02:27:24.287 --> 02:27:26.209]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[02:27:26.650 --> 02:27:27.771]  I used to say, support InfoWars.
[02:27:28.231 --> 02:27:29.112]  Rescue InfoWars.
[02:27:29.192 --> 02:27:29.853]  Save yourself.
[02:27:30.193 --> 02:27:30.854]  Save the world.
[02:27:31.154 --> 02:27:32.015]  We're in this together.
[02:27:32.035 --> 02:27:33.096]  Because let me tell you something.
[02:27:33.777 --> 02:27:34.757]  Communism's up here.
[02:27:34.957 --> 02:27:37.898]  Infowars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[02:27:38.298 --> 02:27:40.138]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[02:27:40.338 --> 02:27:41.859]  My children are right here!
[02:27:42.599 --> 02:27:44.339]  But I need money to fight a war!
[02:27:44.539 --> 02:27:45.579]  And I need word of mouth!
[02:27:45.819 --> 02:27:46.720]  And I need prayer!
[02:27:46.860 --> 02:27:47.820]  And I need action!
[02:27:48.200 --> 02:27:49.780]  Because that dam's gonna come down!
[02:27:50.500 --> 02:27:52.481]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[02:27:53.061 --> 02:27:55.041]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:27:55.141 --> 02:27:58.302]  I'm your fill-in guest host for the last hour.
[02:27:58.697 --> 02:28:00.799]  My name is Jay Dyer of jaysanalysis.com.
[02:28:00.879 --> 02:28:06.385]  I cover geopolitics, espionage, Hollywood, film, and I do a lot of debates.
[02:28:06.945 --> 02:28:08.407]  So you can go check out my material.
[02:28:08.447 --> 02:28:12.491]  But today I want to talk about religious infiltration and corruption.
[02:28:13.032 --> 02:28:17.656]  This is a problem that's not unique to any specific group or denomination.
[02:28:17.716 --> 02:28:21.080]  It's a problem that has actually happened since the time of
[02:28:22.316 --> 02:28:24.076]  Well, the primeval world, right?
[02:28:24.096 --> 02:28:34.259]  I mean, you go all the way back to Plato, you go all the way back to ancient Egypt, and big dynasties, big power structures try to co-opt religion for their own needs and ends.
[02:28:34.739 --> 02:28:39.160]  Plato himself, for example, talked about the need to create a noble lie, right?
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:42.761]  A fake religion that would prop up the state and its power.
[02:28:43.777 --> 02:28:49.481]  And ever since the advent of Christianity, the church has had a long struggle with this same problem.
[02:28:49.882 --> 02:29:03.151]  In the Middle Ages, there was the investiture controversy, the problems of simony, these kinds of things, where the state would often try to buy off the church, put bishops or put ministers in control that would do the bidding of the state.
[02:29:03.591 --> 02:29:11.117]  So it's always been a problem, and it's not, again, unique to any specific group, be it Catholic, be it Orthodox, be it Protestant.
[02:29:12.173 --> 02:29:19.317]  So what I want to talk about today is the 20th century and, in particular, how the Roman Catholic Church was infiltrated and corrupted.
[02:29:19.938 --> 02:29:22.079]  My purpose is not to attack Catholics.
[02:29:22.099 --> 02:29:23.480]  I have a lot of Catholic friends.
[02:29:23.500 --> 02:29:25.921]  Some of my best friends are actually traditional Catholics.
[02:29:26.822 --> 02:29:38.549]  My point, rather, is to illustrate that because the Roman Catholic Church is the numerically largest institution in terms of Christianity, it was seen by the global elite as one of the key things to try to target
[02:29:39.247 --> 02:29:43.830]  And take over, not to necessarily totally destroy, but actually to co-opt.
[02:29:44.751 --> 02:29:52.155]  There was a famous sort of secret society document that came out about a hundred years ago, and it's called the Alta Vendita.
[02:29:52.175 --> 02:30:08.666]  And this was a series of Masonic lodges in Europe that wanted to try to not destroy the Roman Catholic Church, but they said, you know, what we need to do is actually co-opt and turn the office of the papacy into an engine of globalism and revolution.
[02:30:09.815 --> 02:30:14.859]  And so I would recommend reading that document because it is very relevant to today's discussion.
[02:30:14.919 --> 02:30:31.450]  But one thing I want to point out is that just as you heard with G. Edward Griffin earlier, the difficulty and complexity of the situation is not just as simple as saying, well, there was a Masonic or a Communist attempt to destroy the Catholic Church.
[02:30:31.911 --> 02:30:33.332]  It goes a lot deeper than that.
[02:30:33.432 --> 02:30:37.735]  And a lot of good historians and even Catholic historians and lawyers
[02:30:38.345 --> 02:30:39.085]  We're good to go!
[02:31:03.974 --> 02:31:13.860]  Now, if we think back to the last century, you know that I've covered in many of the global elite talks that I do the writings of the most powerful, wealthy people on the planet.
[02:31:13.980 --> 02:31:23.545]  G. Edward Griffin talked about the Rockefellers and different power structures that funded movements that seemed to be antithetical to their own ideas, right?
[02:31:23.645 --> 02:31:32.450]  Why would a zillionaire capitalist fund something that would seem to go contrary to wealth and the attainment of wealth, individual liberties, markets, etc.? ?
[02:31:33.570 --> 02:31:41.017]  The answer is that when you go and look at the reasoning, the methodology, it's because it's a weapon, right?
[02:31:41.037 --> 02:31:46.061]  So you could actually use these ideologies as a weapon to destroy other countries.
[02:31:47.062 --> 02:31:48.103]  Remember Anthony Sutton?
[02:31:48.143 --> 02:31:49.084]  He wrote a famous book.
[02:31:49.144 --> 02:31:50.005]  Actually, I have it right here.
[02:31:50.405 --> 02:31:53.748]  He wrote a book called The Wall Street and the Bolshevik Revolution.
[02:31:54.910 --> 02:32:05.299]  And this is roughly what J. Edgar Griffin was talking about earlier when he was talking about how the Bolsheviks had funding from the West, from very wealthy families and bankers in the West.
[02:32:05.779 --> 02:32:11.544]  And this was done as a way to create a revolution to destroy the existing Christian culture.
[02:32:12.505 --> 02:32:18.410]  Now, we're seeing this here with the similarities to the color revolution models, right?
[02:32:19.763 --> 02:32:25.568]  I made a video months ago talking about how the color revolution model was what we're now seeing in the U.S.
[02:32:25.608 --> 02:32:30.191]  when we started seeing these sort of so-called protests, more like riots, right?
[02:32:30.532 --> 02:32:31.913]  And the destruction, burning of cities.
[02:32:31.973 --> 02:32:34.535]  Now they're openly saying, we're going to burn the cities down to the ground.
[02:32:34.575 --> 02:32:35.496]  Where does this come from?
[02:32:35.556 --> 02:32:36.597]  It's not out of nowhere.
[02:32:37.353 --> 02:32:53.159]  It's a model, right, that if you look at the money that the State Department put into the Soros to putting into the Kola revolutions in the Soviet satellite states, right, these Kola revolutions were a model of destabilization.
[02:32:54.053 --> 02:33:01.435]  And that model utilized a lot of liberal, Marxist, democratic, you could say, ideologies.
[02:33:01.955 --> 02:33:04.916]  You can morph it to fit the culture that you're trying to target.
[02:33:04.936 --> 02:33:17.599]  And it would do that by then destabilizing the society and bringing to power, you know, something under the guise of freedom, under the guise of human rights, and they would utilize these NGOs
[02:33:18.015 --> 02:33:21.936]  These think tanks as the means of subversion in these countries, right?
[02:33:22.216 --> 02:33:31.618]  Otpor, you saw that revolution of the fist, Otpor, that was the first successful model of this in Serbia, if I recall, the Rose Revolution, I think it was.
[02:33:32.478 --> 02:33:36.259]  And that was the same fist that you'll see this used in Black Lives Matter, right?
[02:33:36.299 --> 02:33:40.699]  They just copy and paste the same symbolism over to these different groups.
[02:33:40.759 --> 02:33:43.480]  Now, who or what is this color revolution model?
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:48.583]  It's a model that is a CIA-funded thing that goes back to the Cold War, right?
[02:33:48.603 --> 02:33:51.365]  So the auspices of the Cold War is what I want you to keep in mind.
[02:33:51.785 --> 02:33:57.708]  This threat, oh, we've got to do what we've got to do because of communism, because of the Reds, right?
[02:33:58.069 --> 02:34:01.791]  And I'm not saying that there's not a problem with communist Marxist ideology.
[02:34:01.911 --> 02:34:02.571]  There is.
[02:34:02.711 --> 02:34:05.973]  It's a heinous, anti-human, terrible ideology.
[02:34:07.014 --> 02:34:11.757]  But the solution that the elite want is sometimes even worse than what
[02:34:12.423 --> 02:34:13.544]  They're fighting against, right?
[02:34:13.584 --> 02:34:15.065]  The propped up enemy, right?
[02:34:15.105 --> 02:34:16.526]  We think of propped up enemies.
[02:34:16.687 --> 02:34:17.687]  We think of a bin Laden.
[02:34:17.747 --> 02:34:24.653]  We think of a, you know, these different so-called dictators that that America has to go in and take over and destroy and whatever.
[02:34:25.394 --> 02:34:29.877]  These are oftentimes not the real reasons that we're going into those countries.
[02:34:29.897 --> 02:34:34.921]  And I think a lot of people have, you know, become aware of this with the weapons of mass destruction, this kind of stuff, right?
[02:34:34.941 --> 02:34:39.265]  So you see these kinds of guys that are propped up by these bigger level institutions.
[02:34:40.074 --> 02:34:44.978]  The reason I say all that is because it's not going to be any different when we come to the religious institutions.
[02:34:45.599 --> 02:34:46.400]  They're bought off.
[02:34:46.780 --> 02:34:50.884]  They're co-opted in the exact same pattern, model, and way.
[02:34:51.884 --> 02:34:52.565]  How do I know that?
[02:34:52.605 --> 02:34:53.946]  How can I prove that to you?
[02:34:53.966 --> 02:34:54.827]  I'm going to prove it to you.
[02:34:55.107 --> 02:34:56.388]  I've got the documents, folks.
[02:34:56.428 --> 02:34:57.830]  I've got the documents right here.
[02:34:58.470 --> 02:35:00.612]  The Rockefellers, an American dynasty.
[02:35:00.972 --> 02:35:01.833]  Collier and Horowitz.
[02:35:01.873 --> 02:35:03.815]  Now, this is not a conspiracy book, right?
[02:35:03.855 --> 02:35:07.218]  This is a mainline, authorized biography.
[02:35:07.637 --> 02:35:10.318]  of the Rockefellers from their own archives, right?
[02:35:10.638 --> 02:35:17.619]  So just like Carol Quigley wrote the history of the 20th century from the CFR archives, so they're writing it from the Rockefeller archives.
[02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:31.743]  And there's an important chapter that starts on about page 135 or 136, yeah, and it's about the funding of religious change movements.
[02:35:32.943 --> 02:35:36.164]  You probably know this as the ecumenist movement or ecumenism.
[02:35:37.043 --> 02:35:39.144]  Now, on the surface, it sounds good, right?
[02:35:39.184 --> 02:35:40.505]  It sounds like a nice idea.
[02:35:40.865 --> 02:35:43.367]  Why don't we all get together and have some meetings?
[02:35:43.627 --> 02:35:49.310]  There's all these different groups and sects and dividing, you know, arguments between religious groups.
[02:35:49.370 --> 02:35:50.871]  Why don't we get together and talk it out?
[02:35:51.471 --> 02:35:53.372]  And then maybe we can come to some resolution.
[02:35:53.872 --> 02:35:55.533]  And I would say, in theory, that's fine.
[02:35:55.653 --> 02:35:56.194]  It sounds great.
[02:35:56.214 --> 02:35:58.375]  There's nothing inherently wrong with doing that.
[02:35:58.535 --> 02:35:59.275]  We should do that.
[02:35:59.315 --> 02:36:03.257]  We should have dialogue that's profitable to understand where we're all coming from.
[02:36:04.631 --> 02:36:07.292]  That's not what happened in the ecumenist movement.
[02:36:07.552 --> 02:36:18.297]  In fact, the Rockefellers will put dozens of millions of dollars into the ecumenist movement to steer it and control it, when it was new, into a certain direction.
[02:36:18.957 --> 02:36:26.260]  When we come back from the break, I'm going to explain that and show you what their goal was, a one-world religion, from their own statements and writings.
[02:36:26.901 --> 02:36:30.002]  This is Jay Dyer, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:36:31.098 --> 02:36:33.441]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:36:33.461 --> 02:36:35.203]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[02:36:35.243 --> 02:36:39.888]  Be sure and support InfoWars by buying the supplements in the store.
[02:36:39.908 --> 02:36:52.442]  There's a lot of good stuff there that will definitely keep you guarded against the craziness that we're going into in the present era of all this madness, all the attacks on our country.
[02:36:53.132 --> 02:37:09.355]  So, one of the key attacks on our country came through the religious realm, and I wanted to point out that the Rockefeller's authorized biography has an entire chapter on the creation, funding, and steering of the ecumenical One World Religion movement.
[02:37:09.735 --> 02:37:18.017]  And if you doubt that it was always intended by the time they bought it off to be a One World Religion movement, then let me read you the quote of Junior Rockefeller himself, who said,
[02:37:18.914 --> 02:37:22.836]  That it was time to set aside all the denominational emphases.
[02:37:23.097 --> 02:37:24.878]  Instead, it's time for cooperation.
[02:37:25.778 --> 02:37:33.102]  In the large cities, I see great religious centers, small places instead of a dozen little dying churches competing with one another.
[02:37:33.783 --> 02:37:37.325]  I see strong churches uniting the Christian life of the town.
[02:37:37.445 --> 02:37:47.231]  I see the church molding the thought of the world as it had never done before, leading a great movement and literally establishing the kingdom of God on earth.
[02:37:48.186 --> 02:38:02.519]  Right after this, Junior Rockefeller gave a total, get this, in the 1920s and 30s of $75 million to global inter-church, interdenominational ecumenist movements.
[02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:09.646]  Now that social gospel that he's funding here, right, that is not a gospel about
[02:38:10.501 --> 02:38:16.144]  You know, what we think of the Bible, you know, talking about Jesus dying and rising from the dead, this kind of stuff.
[02:38:16.565 --> 02:38:30.213]  It's a religion with the demythologized miraculous, the removal of the miraculous, that kind of stuff, to turn it into a social religion, social gospel, or sometimes called liberation theology.
[02:38:30.816 --> 02:38:31.416]  That's right.
[02:38:53.231 --> 02:39:03.080]  It's even wilder than that, because after that, they go on, the Rockefellers, to build a giant cathedral that would be their own ecumenical cathedrals, known as Riverside Church.
[02:39:03.720 --> 02:39:13.609]  And in this Gothic edifice, they erected statues to Confucius, Moses, Hegel, Dante, Mohammed, and Darwin.
[02:39:15.706 --> 02:39:35.314]  You could not get a better example of an original world religion church than what Junior Rockefeller had built, and he said this would be the key capstone in his mind for the coming world religion that would not be interested in, you know, Jesus as the way, the truth, and life, or something like that, right?
[02:39:35.394 --> 02:39:44.297]  It's a new type of religion that would go along with, right, the previous chapter in the Rockefeller biography, Chapter 8, is all about the CFR,
[02:39:44.895 --> 02:39:49.677]  The creation of the CFR in 1921, which would steer the U.S.
[02:39:49.817 --> 02:39:57.560]  into a interventionist policy, into a global affairs world empire, right?
[02:39:57.580 --> 02:39:59.581]  This is literally what they say they wanted to do.
[02:40:00.101 --> 02:40:01.782]  And this was with the aid of J.P.
[02:40:01.822 --> 02:40:06.924]  Morgan, Woodrow Wilson, Colonel Edwin Mandelhouse, all that kind of stuff that you've probably heard of.
[02:40:07.384 --> 02:40:12.066]  All of that was in concert with the Rockefellers setting up the CFR in 1921 at the same time as their
[02:40:13.809 --> 02:40:25.559]  Basically funding and steering the entire ecumenist movement, even to the point of eventually creating what you know as the World Council of Churches or the National Council of Churches.
[02:40:26.244 --> 02:40:43.959]  So a lot of times we think of those institutions as Marxist institutions, but what people are misunderstanding is that, just like Edward Griffin pointed out, Marxism and this liberal social gospel work together and are fostered and funded at the higher levels by these really wealthy, powerful people.
[02:40:44.880 --> 02:40:47.442]  So there's a kind of a staged fight, if you will.
[02:40:47.462 --> 02:40:50.084]  I'm not saying everything in the Cold War was fake.
[02:40:50.585 --> 02:40:52.626]  There was obviously, I mean, my uncle was a Cold Warrior.
[02:40:52.667 --> 02:40:54.348]  He was involved in some of these operations.
[02:40:55.023 --> 02:40:55.223]  Right.
[02:40:55.243 --> 02:40:58.847]  So he wasn't it wasn't fake when he was, you know, surveilling stuff.
[02:40:59.388 --> 02:41:07.035]  But the higher level of the high level people that we're talking about here, they're above the conflicts that are that are nation states.
[02:41:07.175 --> 02:41:15.524]  They were internationalists a long time ago, you see, because they had the money, the power, the wealth to avoid the laws of specific areas and nation states.
[02:41:15.944 --> 02:41:16.765]  So they could just move around.
[02:41:16.785 --> 02:41:18.427]  They could just fly it anywhere they wanted to, you see.
[02:41:19.488 --> 02:41:26.990]  So they were very interested in fostering these systems, like communism in China, that was all set up at the behest of the OSS.
[02:41:27.030 --> 02:41:36.132]  It was Bill Donovan that trained Mao's guerrillas, right, to basically create the spy networks and set up the intelligence apparatus of communist China.
[02:41:37.572 --> 02:41:44.614]  It was the, as we saw from Sutton, it was the wealthy elites that funded and put Bolshevism in place in Russia in 1917, right?
[02:41:47.060 --> 02:41:54.487]  So, the Cold War functions, again, maybe at a mid-level, you could say, where you've got the espionage and the spying going on.
[02:41:54.527 --> 02:41:58.990]  If you watch that famous Fox series, The Americans, it's a really well-done series.
[02:41:59.071 --> 02:42:03.114]  It's more realistic than most television shows about this kind of stuff.
[02:42:03.174 --> 02:42:14.364]  You'll notice a lot of what I'm talking about was going on at their level of the fight during the Cold War, and some of that was based on real Soviet operations in the U.S., the illegals program, as it's called.
[02:42:14.844 --> 02:42:17.526]  But at the higher level is what I'm talking about, right?
[02:42:17.566 --> 02:42:19.527]  This would be people like Robert Maxwell, right?
[02:42:19.547 --> 02:42:21.628]  The father of Ghislaine Maxwell.
[02:42:21.949 --> 02:42:24.210]  This would be people like Victor Rothschild, right?
[02:42:24.250 --> 02:42:26.611]  Who was a famous double agent during the Cold War.
[02:42:27.532 --> 02:42:29.373]  It would be people like the Rockefellers, right?
[02:42:29.713 --> 02:42:33.776]  David Rockefeller flew over to Communist China and set up the first bank.
[02:42:34.742 --> 02:42:36.583]  In communist China, Chase Bank.
[02:42:36.603 --> 02:42:37.603]  Isn't that wild?
[02:42:38.203 --> 02:42:49.026]  But again, you think of it as counterintuitive, but if you think at this higher level, right above the spy craft, right, which was really happening, there were really spies being played off against each other in the Cold War, very real.
[02:42:49.046 --> 02:42:59.268]  You know, people get killed, people went into, you know, conflicts, people, there was the real cloak and dagger stuff, but at this higher level, it was for a long-term game plan.
[02:42:59.388 --> 02:43:01.889]  Now, how can I demonstrate that from these guys?
[02:43:01.909 --> 02:43:02.029]  Well,
[02:43:03.061 --> 02:43:05.083]  You've probably heard of Old Zbigniew, right?
[02:43:05.583 --> 02:43:06.444]  Old Zbig.
[02:43:06.484 --> 02:43:14.490]  He wrote that famous book Between Two Ages back in the 70s, early 70s, which mentioned all kinds of crazy things like weather warfare.
[02:43:14.670 --> 02:43:18.693]  It mentions, you know, HAARP controlling the atmosphere and this kind of stuff.
[02:43:19.353 --> 02:43:22.636]  But this whole book is about how we transition into technocracy.
[02:43:23.732 --> 02:43:32.574]  Way ahead of its time, one of the key books, it was this book in fact, that got David Rockefeller to say, that guy needs to be in charge of the Trilateral Commission.
[02:43:32.614 --> 02:43:33.954]  So he called up Henry Kissinger.
[02:43:34.374 --> 02:43:40.016]  Henry Kissinger said, yes, Mr. Rockefeller, we will place, we will place Zbig in just the right position.
[02:43:40.456 --> 02:43:43.216]  And David Rockefeller said, Zbig is perfect.
[02:43:43.336 --> 02:43:46.077]  I want him in charge of the Trilateral Commission.
[02:43:46.801 --> 02:43:51.004]  And then Zbig came into the office and he creates Al-Qaeda.
[02:43:51.584 --> 02:43:53.646]  He's the one who goes and creates Al-Qaeda.
[02:43:55.134 --> 02:43:56.295]  That's what we're dealing with here.
[02:43:56.355 --> 02:43:58.177]  These are the geostrategists, right?
[02:43:58.517 --> 02:44:03.401]  Who, and yes, it's true that Zbigniew played a key role in the Cold War, right?
[02:44:03.461 --> 02:44:05.963]  He's the one who invented that arc of crisis model.
[02:44:06.003 --> 02:44:13.669]  He's the one who utilized and created essentially the Al-Qaeda, Mujahideen networks to fight against the Soviets in Afghanistan.
[02:44:14.169 --> 02:44:21.956]  But again, if we want to draw this back to the religious realm, remember, there's a whole section in Brzezinski on the Roman Catholic Church.
[02:44:22.981 --> 02:44:27.563]  And how it could be used and what the effects of the ecumenist movement were.
[02:44:27.763 --> 02:44:39.807]  So in the, about page 87 here in my copy, he starts talking about the fact that the ecumenist dialogue that was happening wasn't just between religions and denominations.
[02:44:39.847 --> 02:44:51.572]  He says that once the Roman Catholic Church started dialoguing with the Marxists, he says this had a profound effect on the relativizing of truth in the minds of Roman Catholics.
[02:44:52.752 --> 02:45:00.695]  So, remember, there was supposed to be a usage of the Church in the Cold War by the CIA to combat Marxism.
[02:45:01.295 --> 02:45:08.577]  And then it starts to flip and they start saying, now you need to start dialoguing with the Marxists, all you Roman Catholics, all you prelates, popes.
[02:45:09.418 --> 02:45:21.802]  And so once they started doing this, particularly around the time of John XXIII, who called Vatican II, it's a big note that this really started breaking down in the minds of Catholics the idea that there was objective truth.
[02:45:22.429 --> 02:45:32.314]  Because now, supposedly, these enemies that we're fighting in this Cold War, now we can have these ecumenical dialogues and come to some kind of common ground, some kind of synthesis.
[02:45:32.854 --> 02:45:35.195]  Thesis, antithesis, synthesis.
[02:45:35.335 --> 02:45:40.358]  That Hegelian principle was adopted by Marxism, okay?
[02:45:41.263 --> 02:45:42.483]  Thanks for joining us.
[02:46:11.144 --> 02:46:12.505]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:46:12.565 --> 02:46:15.067]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer of Jays Analysis.
[02:46:15.127 --> 02:46:20.892]  If you're looking for a couple interesting books to read, you can go get my books at my website, jaysanalysis.com.
[02:46:20.932 --> 02:46:30.380]  I have Esoteric Hollywood 1 and 2, where I break down the biggest films and what all of that weird symbolism and messaging was all about.
[02:46:30.920 --> 02:46:33.062]  Everything from Kubrick all the way up to Bond.
[02:46:34.065 --> 02:46:38.666]  In the new latest Marvel films you can all find a dissection of those in my books.
[02:46:38.706 --> 02:46:44.868]  Now we were talking about Brzezinski and what he said about the Roman Catholic Church back in the 70s and how he could be basically steered.
[02:46:45.588 --> 02:46:51.789]  And he says there's one guy that we really need to note and that's this Jesuit by the name of Teilhard de Chardin.
[02:46:52.489 --> 02:46:57.731]  Now Teilhard is famous because a long time ago he was actually censured by the Vatican.
[02:46:57.751 --> 02:47:02.652]  He was told that he, you know, can't teach and can't talk about stuff because he has such weird radical views.
[02:47:03.624 --> 02:47:12.931]  And that weird radical view that he had was not just Darwinian evolution, but actually the apotheosis of man through evolutionary progress, namely transhumanism.
[02:47:12.971 --> 02:47:18.756]  Yes, Teilhard de Chardin, the famous jizz, was one of the most famous early transhumanists.
[02:47:20.598 --> 02:47:38.660]  Brzezinski says Teilhard is a key figure because if we can kind of get that kind of a guy propped up within Catholicism, right, if he can now be the model of what a Catholic is, then that will really contribute to the steering of this religion into something amenable to the globalist goals, right?
[02:47:39.167 --> 02:47:47.994]  And remember, even though Brzezinski was working to defeat the Soviets on the behest of the American Empire and the CFR and all that, it wasn't really about America.
[02:47:48.755 --> 02:47:51.897]  Eventually, Brzezinski wrote essays saying, it's time for America to go away.
[02:47:52.517 --> 02:47:53.338]  America needs to die.
[02:47:53.378 --> 02:47:53.738]  It's done.
[02:47:53.939 --> 02:47:56.801]  All the stuff you're hearing the globalists nowadays say, right?
[02:47:56.841 --> 02:47:58.442]  They're saying, it's time.
[02:47:58.502 --> 02:47:59.303]  It's done.
[02:47:59.403 --> 02:48:00.223]  It's a dead thing.
[02:48:00.283 --> 02:48:04.647]  It's time to shed this skin and move into the full-on United Nations-style globalism.
[02:48:05.901 --> 02:48:10.871]  Brzezinski, before he died, wrote, I think it was an op-ed or a piece in the New York Times essentially saying that.
[02:48:12.617 --> 02:48:18.763]  But if you could prop up somebody like a Teilhard de Chardin, who himself kind of admitted that he was a Luciferian, right?
[02:48:18.823 --> 02:48:29.113]  He wasn't so much interested in the biblical ideas of Jesus, it was more like all this stuff is just symbols for you, or man in general, the elites, aka the elites, right?
[02:48:29.534 --> 02:48:36.481]  Attaining this eventual deification of themselves, apotheosis, man becoming God by technology.
[02:48:37.091 --> 02:48:47.858]  And so he wrote these weird treatises about the noosphere and matter eventually evolving into becoming spirit and everything becoming one and all this kind of new agey gibberish.
[02:48:47.898 --> 02:48:56.804]  But he was propped up, that's what I'm trying to say, he was intentionally propped up by the global elite as a model kind of Catholic and eventually more or less rehabilitated.
[02:48:57.084 --> 02:48:59.806]  So even though the Vatican a long time ago had kind of censured him,
[02:49:00.882 --> 02:49:03.904]  He eventually gets rehabilitated and he becomes kind of a model.
[02:49:04.444 --> 02:49:24.157]  There's another book that I want to point your attention to, and it's a book by a Catholic himself, a traditionally minded Catholic, by the name of David Wimhoff, and he wrote this big book called John Courtney Murray, Time Life Magazine and the American Proposition, How the CIA's Doctrinal Warfare Program Changed the Catholic Church.
[02:49:24.978 --> 02:49:28.640]  Now, again, I'm not saying this to attack Catholics because he is a Catholic.
[02:49:29.230 --> 02:49:38.595]  I'm just pointing out that even Catholics have realized the pattern and model of buying off the denominations, the different groups, what you just saw from the Rockefeller's biography, right?
[02:49:39.696 --> 02:49:43.418]  David Wimhoff is writing about how it happened to the Catholic Church, right?
[02:49:43.578 --> 02:49:48.761]  So, Collier and Horowitz are discussing how it was done to the Protestant churches by the Rockefellers.
[02:49:49.201 --> 02:49:49.601]  Guess what?
[02:49:49.661 --> 02:49:56.785]  It's the same power structure that's going to buy off the Catholic seminaries, the Catholic academic institutions.
[02:49:57.611 --> 02:50:00.133]  And it's not just with money, it's also compromise.
[02:50:00.193 --> 02:50:08.240]  In fact, Wim Hof has a whole chapter about how some of the really key prelates back in the 60s were compromised by different intelligence agencies.
[02:50:08.721 --> 02:50:24.254]  Perhaps even Cardinal Spellman himself, famous American Cardinal, was compromised because there's a noticeable change in some of these prelates where they begin to really adopt this sort of liberal, globalized, one-world religion version of Catholicism.
[02:50:25.569 --> 02:50:26.649]  And they begin to promote it.
[02:50:27.090 --> 02:50:42.575]  And this is what, according to Wim Hof, really achieves the full force of Vatican II is achieved, in other words, by these compromised prelates and people like the Jesuits such as John Courtney Murray.
[02:50:42.896 --> 02:50:51.999]  So John Courtney Murray was this really liberal-minded Jesuit who basically wanted to see the Roman Catholic Church co-opted into being an institution that could kind of
[02:50:52.759 --> 02:50:57.862]  Just like Brzezinski said, spread a kind of new type of religion, a new Christianity, right?
[02:50:57.902 --> 02:51:02.285]  A new kind of open religion to the rest of the world.
[02:51:02.445 --> 02:51:09.850]  And it didn't have to be some kind of rigid old thing that was, you know, stuck in, you know, dogmas and medieval stuff.
[02:51:09.910 --> 02:51:11.371]  It needed to be updated.
[02:51:11.891 --> 02:51:12.672]  Yeah, so there you go.
[02:51:12.752 --> 02:51:14.653]  You know, notice Time Magazine, right?
[02:51:15.154 --> 02:51:16.055]  How did this come about?
[02:51:16.115 --> 02:51:27.801]  Well, Henry Luce, himself a famous Skull and Bones member, who was running Time Magazine at that time and was getting all of this globalist money from the Rockefellers, millions of dollars, from other entities as well.
[02:51:28.402 --> 02:51:31.864]  Well, he propped up John Courtney Murray as the greatest Jesuit, right?
[02:51:31.884 --> 02:51:35.286]  The greatest theologian that, you know, America had produced and all this stuff.
[02:51:36.926 --> 02:51:39.268]  And so this helps aid in
[02:51:40.057 --> 02:51:43.138]  The establishment of and the co-opting of the Catholic Church.
[02:51:43.378 --> 02:51:46.858]  Now, what was the excuse and the basis for doing this?
[02:51:47.338 --> 02:51:59.541]  Remember, it's the exact same thing that G. Edward Griffin explained in the last segment, where he said that they used the threat of communism as the excuse to basically do anything like this, to do all of this.
[02:52:00.281 --> 02:52:04.342]  There's a great book by an intelligence analyst named Gordon Thomas.
[02:52:04.966 --> 02:52:08.167]  And he wrote a book about intelligence operations.
[02:52:08.227 --> 02:52:09.567]  I think this is one on the Mossad.
[02:52:10.488 --> 02:52:11.528]  It's not an attack piece.
[02:52:11.588 --> 02:52:13.809]  It's just a history of different intelligence agencies.
[02:52:13.829 --> 02:52:16.850]  He's wrote a book on MKUltra, for example.
[02:52:17.430 --> 02:52:22.591]  In that book, he discusses the history of the CIA meeting with John Paul II during the Cold War.
[02:52:23.491 --> 02:52:24.232]  There's another book.
[02:52:24.892 --> 02:52:27.973]  There's a book by Malachi Martin, another famous ex-Jesuit.
[02:52:28.513 --> 02:52:31.774]  And in this book, he describes meetings with the CIA and the Jesuits.
[02:52:32.279 --> 02:52:36.084]  In terms of ending the Cold War with Bush at Malta, right?
[02:52:36.524 --> 02:52:47.638]  So there were these big high-power meetings between John Paul II, international intelligence agencies, and they would go and they would kind of figure out ways to settle the big geopolitical issues.
[02:52:48.371 --> 02:53:03.011]  But what happened was, is that this shows very clearly that the Roman Catholic institution, a long time ago, back during the period of the Cold War, the time of Vatican II, that's when it was really being co-opted and steered into this direction of globalism.
[02:53:03.809 --> 02:53:10.673]  And it's very evident when you read these big, kind of high-level, white paper, geopolitical tomes, they're all very candid about it.
[02:53:10.774 --> 02:53:11.994]  Malachi Martin was very candid about it.
[02:53:12.014 --> 02:53:21.941]  He said, and I mean, I'm not propping up Malachi Martin, I think he was a dubious character, but you can tease out of what he writes, you know, being right there at the right hand of a lot of these popes.
[02:53:21.981 --> 02:53:25.423]  He was really close to Paul VI, for example.
[02:53:25.743 --> 02:53:29.826]  So he knew the inner workings of the Vatican, and he said very clearly that this has all been co-opted.
[02:53:30.306 --> 02:53:44.236]  It's been taken over by a counter-revolutionary force, or excuse me, by a revolutionary force within the church to turn the papacy into an institution for global New Age One World Religion type of stuff.
[02:53:44.956 --> 02:53:50.420]  And John Paul II was a great example of that because you'll notice when he was having these geopolitical meetings,
[02:53:51.147 --> 02:53:52.288]  What was he then doing?
[02:53:52.628 --> 02:53:57.392]  Well, in the mid 80s, he had this meeting that's really well known called the Assisi Gatherings.
[02:53:57.993 --> 02:54:04.999]  And this is where all of the different world religions and a big parliament of world religions came to the cathedral in Assisi.
[02:54:05.928 --> 02:54:10.992]  They literally all prayed together, holding plants and, you know, we're kind of, I don't know what they're doing.
[02:54:11.032 --> 02:54:13.895]  They put a statue of the Buddha in the church there.
[02:54:13.915 --> 02:54:15.396]  It's a very famous gathering.
[02:54:15.556 --> 02:54:21.001]  And so this was a beginning, a new opening up of the threshold, so to speak, of a one world religion.
[02:54:21.061 --> 02:54:21.861]  It's called the 1986 Assisi Gathering.
[02:54:24.540 --> 02:54:38.445]  And you might have thought that was revolutionary, and it was in 1986, but really John Paul II was just doing the type of thing that the people above him, who had for a long time co-opted and controlled this institution, had been wanting to steer it into.
[02:54:39.185 --> 02:54:42.286]  So he's just doing basically the bidding of what his masters wanted him to do.
[02:54:43.107 --> 02:54:51.270]  And he was already, as I'm saying, co-opted by the CIA, and that goes all the way back, the liberal elements of the CIA, going all the way back to the 1960s.
[02:54:53.004 --> 02:54:57.370]  Especially the time of Vatican II, and Wim Hof proves that in about 800 pages, right?
[02:54:57.390 --> 02:55:00.113]  So there you go, you see the Assisi gathering all the world religions there.
[02:55:00.674 --> 02:55:04.659]  This is the beginning of what would be the new world religion, right?
[02:55:04.719 --> 02:55:08.384]  No longer about Jesus, but the very dream of the Rockefellers themselves, right?
[02:55:08.424 --> 02:55:10.847]  To have this global New Age cult.
[02:55:11.966 --> 02:55:22.580]  We fast forward to now, this has really been, I mean, John Paul couldn't have even dreamt of the radical elements that Pope Francis has done in this regard.
[02:55:23.201 --> 02:55:29.530]  In fact, he most recently had this Amazon Synod, right before all the COVID stuff, there was the Amazon Synod where
[02:55:29.997 --> 02:55:41.867]  Pope Francis got all the indigenous groups in the Amazon region, and he wanted to sign this new document that would promote the symbol of this idol called Pachamama.
[02:55:42.267 --> 02:55:47.432]  Now, Pachamama is an image or a goddess related to human sacrifice.
[02:55:48.272 --> 02:55:49.854]  And then what does Francis do?
[02:55:50.014 --> 02:55:58.361]  He offers a Vatican prayer service in front of this Pachamama idol, showing another example of this world religion that they want to bring in.
[02:55:59.597 --> 02:56:00.999]  And it gets even crazier than that.
[02:56:01.019 --> 02:56:05.625]  I mean, if you read the document, right, it sounds like something AOC, there he is, blessing the idol.
[02:56:06.546 --> 02:56:13.195]  If you read the Amazon Sinai document, it sounds like something AOC would write where we have to confess our sins.
[02:56:13.275 --> 02:56:14.297]  And then most recently,
[02:56:14.957 --> 02:56:18.459]  He said it's time for a new council based on humanism.
[02:56:18.619 --> 02:56:27.482]  Yes, last year, I think it was last year, Francis said it's time to call a council that will be based around secular humanism for all the religions to unite around.
[02:56:27.842 --> 02:56:36.005]  So all I'm saying is that even within the traditional Catholic world itself, people are realizing that this was a bigger elite plan to steer these religions.
[02:56:36.926 --> 02:56:38.426]  I'm Jay Dyer from Jay's Analysis.
[02:56:38.886 --> 02:56:40.007]  This is the Alex Jones Show!
[02:56:49.853 --> 02:56:51.695]  You can feel it.
[02:56:51.795 --> 02:56:52.695]  You can see it.
[02:56:52.755 --> 02:56:53.916]  You can taste it.
[02:56:54.076 --> 02:56:55.978]  You can smell it.
[02:56:56.118 --> 02:56:57.939]  You can touch it.
[02:56:58.120 --> 02:57:01.522]  And deep in my spirit,
[02:57:19.758 --> 02:57:25.504]  I've got a fiery tingle up and down my spine that goes into my jaw and into my eyes.
[02:57:26.064 --> 02:57:42.882]  I'm on fire right now because I know in the next 40 days of this election and the insanity and the globalist nuclear meltdown that we're going to see when Trump wins, that everything you do and everything I do is going to affect the future of the world for good or for bad.
[02:57:43.831 --> 02:57:49.493]  The globalists have made a very dangerous authoritarian move with all this massive censorship and surveillance.
[02:57:50.093 --> 02:57:51.114]  Just think about censorship.
[02:57:51.194 --> 02:57:54.615]  It takes surveillance of what you're doing and saying to have that censorship.
[02:57:55.215 --> 02:57:57.016]  They've had this massive AI move.
[02:57:57.056 --> 02:58:01.358]  They've had their street bullies out shooting cops and burning down buildings and setting up checkpoints.
[02:58:01.758 --> 02:58:04.219]  They have really launched an authoritarian takeover.
[02:58:05.017 --> 02:58:08.420]  And it's because they're losing the hearts and minds, not just here, but worldwide.
[02:58:08.700 --> 02:58:14.444]  And they know that the tide is turning against them, so they're throwing everything they've got at us right now.
[02:58:15.005 --> 02:58:25.232]  But if we let them normalize all of this tyranny, and their COVID power grab, and their free speech annihilations, and all their physical attacks, then we will go under their tyranny, and they would have broken our will.
[02:58:26.075 --> 02:58:27.376]  And then things are going to get a lot worse.
[02:58:28.157 --> 02:58:42.610]  The New World Order is on record that if they're able to defeat Trump, Bolsonaro, and others around the world that are patriots, if they're able to successfully and effectively silence you and I, that they're going to move to a level very, very quick of unthinkable oppression and total control.
[02:58:43.331 --> 02:58:50.555]  That's why they're admitting that the new force of inoculations coming next year will actually maim and kill a lot of people because Bill Gates knows he can't hide it.
[02:58:51.035 --> 02:58:59.000]  That's why Trump is taking control of the process saying he's going to have an early vaccine from a company that doesn't make one that is so dangerous or that doesn't change our DNA.
[02:58:59.220 --> 02:59:01.841]  And I'm not even endorsing what Trump's doing, but I understand what he's doing.
[02:59:02.502 --> 02:59:05.463]  So, things have been critical for 20 plus years that I've been on air.
[02:59:05.483 --> 02:59:06.424]  They were critical before that.
[02:59:06.804 --> 02:59:11.927]  But they're all building, building, building, building towards this moment now and what is going to happen in the future.
[02:59:12.662 --> 02:59:20.688]  And so the way we respond to this now and the way we take action to this now is like a game of pool when you first break the balls.
[02:59:21.269 --> 02:59:26.613]  It's going to dictate so much of the coming game how we carry this out right now.
[02:59:26.893 --> 02:59:29.415]  So ladies and gentlemen, pray to God for a global awakening.
[02:59:29.876 --> 02:59:37.962]  Pray to God to give you discernment and lead God and direct you to know how to fight the enemy politically, spiritually, culturally, financially, and physically if they attack you to defend yourself.
[02:59:38.483 --> 02:59:41.225]  And realize that InfoWars is truly the tip of the spear.
[02:59:42.048 --> 02:59:45.650]  And it's only benefit in the spirit because of your support, your prayer.
[02:59:46.010 --> 02:59:51.613]  So please remember to support MFORESTORE.com today because without you, we will not be able to continue to operate.
[02:59:51.834 --> 03:00:03.680]  And I'm firing the bat signal and saying now is the time that your support is so critical because over the years, the censorship, the lawsuits, the attacks, the enemy has really gotten us squeezed down to a point that I didn't want to ever get to.
[03:00:03.920 --> 03:00:05.061]  But I'm being honest with you now.
[03:00:05.281 --> 03:00:06.562]  We're seeing a lot of folks come through.
[03:00:06.802 --> 03:00:08.483]  We're seeing orders massively increase.
[03:00:09.599 --> 03:00:12.060]  But with everything going on, it's still not enough.
[03:00:12.120 --> 03:00:13.840]  So get products you already need.
[03:00:13.880 --> 03:00:15.080]  Get high quality, storable food.
[03:00:15.120 --> 03:00:24.602]  Get books, films, supplements that are so good for your body, so good for your immune system, and know that you are funding an operation that is challenging the globalists effectively on a massive scale.
[03:00:25.282 --> 03:00:26.542]  Thank you so much for all you've done.
[03:00:26.723 --> 03:00:34.584]  I salute you, and I ask you to now count the cost, look at the historical juncture point we're at, and to make the right decision at this fork in the road.
[03:00:34.964 --> 03:00:38.405]  I'm Alex Jones, and if you're watching this, never forget, you are the resistance.
[03:00:51.291 --> 03:00:54.672]  This is going to come down to a fight over how many people are awake and how many aren't.
[03:00:54.692 --> 03:00:55.833]  They're going to contest the election.
[03:00:55.853 --> 03:00:57.273]  They're going to say Trump lost.
[03:00:57.593 --> 03:00:58.974]  They're super pissed that I'm on air.
[03:00:59.074 --> 03:01:00.094]  I want them shut down.
[03:01:00.174 --> 03:01:01.074]  I want them silenced.
[03:01:01.134 --> 03:01:01.915]  I want them muted.
[03:01:01.955 --> 03:01:03.735]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[03:01:03.775 --> 03:01:04.716]  You kept us on air.
[03:01:04.836 --> 03:01:06.136]  We did the analysis first.
[03:01:06.396 --> 03:01:07.396]  It's now gone mainstream.
[03:01:07.476 --> 03:01:09.277]  We continue to be the epicenter.
[03:01:09.557 --> 03:01:15.479]  And what they've said directly to us is you continue to be the epicenter of our plans not going the way we want.
[03:01:15.659 --> 03:01:17.120]  And you need to stop right now.
[03:01:17.200 --> 03:01:18.260]  And they're very, very serious.
[03:01:18.420 --> 03:01:20.801]  Well, I'm not signing on with a bunch of devil-worshipping child molesters.
[03:01:21.101 --> 03:01:21.961]  This is not going to happen.
[03:01:21.981 --> 03:01:23.621]  So, they are moving now to destroy me.
[03:01:24.082 --> 03:01:26.542]  I used to say support InfoWars, rescue InfoWars.
[03:01:26.622 --> 03:01:28.262]  Save yourself, save the world.
[03:01:28.582 --> 03:01:29.442]  We're in this together.
[03:01:29.562 --> 03:01:31.183]  Because let me tell you something.
[03:01:31.203 --> 03:01:35.343]  Communism's up here, InfoWars is the dam blocking it, which is all of us together supporting.
[03:01:35.723 --> 03:01:37.544]  And you and I are all down here with our families.
[03:01:37.764 --> 03:01:39.324]  My children are right here!
[03:01:40.044 --> 03:01:41.785]  But I need money to fight a war!
[03:01:41.985 --> 03:01:43.045]  And I need word of mouth!
[03:01:43.265 --> 03:01:44.145]  And I need prayer!
[03:01:44.305 --> 03:01:45.245]  And I need action!
[03:01:45.645 --> 03:01:47.225]  Because that dam's going to come down!
[03:01:47.926 --> 03:01:49.886]  Trump's told you, hell's coming!
[03:01:50.626 --> 03:01:53.769]  All right, Alex Jones here, back live, broadcasting worldwide.
[03:01:54.990 --> 03:02:00.756]  And I want to just salute Keith Bessemer and the folks at MyPatriotSupply because they've been a sponsor for 13 years.
[03:02:01.256 --> 03:02:02.417]  They've been around 14 years.
[03:02:02.958 --> 03:02:05.360]  They immediately bought up some of the bigger, better companies.
[03:02:05.580 --> 03:02:07.062]  We immediately got good feedback.
[03:02:07.642 --> 03:02:08.943]  I didn't want a bunch of food sponsors.
[03:02:09.003 --> 03:02:10.225]  I wanted one good one I could trust.
[03:02:10.285 --> 03:02:10.645]  I got them.
[03:02:11.245 --> 03:02:14.308]  And so we sell their whole food line in FullerStore.com.
[03:02:14.368 --> 03:02:14.589]  But
[03:02:15.779 --> 03:02:29.910]  Because of the Communist Chinese attacks on our servers, and where you've got to put in a little code to prove you're a human to get in, and the rest of it, just decimating the amount of folks that get in InfoWarshore.com to buy the books, the films, the water filtration, the supplements.
[03:02:31.171 --> 03:02:33.692]  I called them a few weeks ago, and I said, look, we're under this attack.
[03:02:34.233 --> 03:02:37.956]  Can you just set up a URL for us, and then we get a percentage of the sales we get?
[03:02:37.976 --> 03:02:41.138]  Because I've got to move into just not even having our websites anymore.
[03:02:41.178 --> 03:02:42.679]  I mean, we're under this level of attack.
[03:02:44.642 --> 03:02:46.703]  They weren't sure they could even do it in a month.
[03:02:46.883 --> 03:02:47.343]  Boom!
[03:02:48.063 --> 03:02:50.684]  And Keith Bessemer, the president of MyPatreon, goes, Oh, no, no.
[03:02:51.244 --> 03:02:52.344]  We got it done for you.
[03:02:53.524 --> 03:02:59.706]  And so a discount on top of everything at a special URL that leads you to a special page.
[03:03:00.626 --> 03:03:03.947]  $170 discount on something that's already the best price you're going to find.
[03:03:03.987 --> 03:03:06.047]  So again, Keith, you've got the floor here.
[03:03:06.067 --> 03:03:07.988]  Tell folks about the special that's running right now.
[03:03:08.028 --> 03:03:11.909]  This is unprecedented because you guys already have the lowest price for the quality of food you've got.
[03:03:11.929 --> 03:03:12.809]  That's well known in the industry.
[03:03:13.109 --> 03:03:16.992]  So the three things are the air, the food, and the water.
[03:03:17.693 --> 03:03:25.860]  We've talked about the food, and the first time we've been able to run a sale or a special all year because we've worked so hard with the suppliers to get the $100 savings.
[03:03:26.300 --> 03:03:29.362]  That's exclusive right now with PrepareWithAlex.com.
[03:03:30.083 --> 03:03:32.625]  Then there's the water, and this is just as important.
[03:03:32.665 --> 03:03:34.447]  You know, you only live three days without water.
[03:03:34.887 --> 03:03:39.451]  This is a kit we've never offered before that could help support the InfoWar.
[03:03:39.531 --> 03:03:41.953]  And for your viewers, your listeners, Alex,
[03:03:42.478 --> 03:03:47.862]  It's the Alexa Pure Pro that you always hear about, and that always comes with one filter that filters up to 5,000 gallons.
[03:03:48.342 --> 03:03:53.505]  Well, we've kind of amped this up, just like that sports car you were talking about there 20 minutes ago, the Shelby and all.
[03:03:53.886 --> 03:03:59.970]  We've amped this baby up where you can put four filters into the Alexa Pure Pro, so this thing can flow
[03:04:00.972 --> 03:04:06.374]  With gravity, meaning no electricity, and purified, up to 20,000 gallons of water.
[03:04:06.394 --> 03:04:09.575]  Sits on a nice stand that comes included in this kit.
[03:04:09.976 --> 03:04:15.638]  You can put some of the water into a collapsible water storage container, and we've even given you replacement parts.
[03:04:15.698 --> 03:04:22.960]  Today, on this site, preparewithalex.com, the Alexa Pure Pro Ultimate Kit is with $170 savings.
[03:04:25.356 --> 03:04:26.677]  So that's all sitting there as well.
[03:04:26.998 --> 03:04:28.499]  And then, of course, the Alexa Pure Breathe.
[03:04:28.559 --> 03:04:35.105]  I mean, what a mess with the air and all the problems, wildfires from the West Coast blowing all the way across the northern states.
[03:04:35.586 --> 03:04:38.088]  New York was showing pictures yesterday of it and such.
[03:04:38.408 --> 03:04:41.051]  You don't want to breathe that junk in your home.
[03:04:41.391 --> 03:04:44.334]  That's what the Alexa Pure Breathe is all about.
[03:04:44.354 --> 03:04:46.215]  It's an indoor air filtration unit.
[03:04:46.536 --> 03:04:50.099]  It has a true HEPA system inside, a four-stage process that helps
[03:04:50.512 --> 03:04:51.493]  We're good to go.
[03:05:10.592 --> 03:05:11.333]  We're good.
[03:05:28.024 --> 03:05:32.206]  I know I guess I'm locked into some type of funding, but this is very, very exciting.
[03:05:32.226 --> 03:05:34.127]  Preparewithalex.com.
[03:05:34.167 --> 03:05:35.248]  Preparewithalex.com.
[03:05:35.708 --> 03:05:38.510]  This is no doubt the best deals anywhere.
[03:05:38.530 --> 03:05:40.551]  This is the best deal you're going to find ever.
